note

wolfgang
von
goethe
the
greatest
of
german
men
of
letters
was
born
at
frank
august
his
father
was
a
man
of
means
and
position
and
he
personally
supervised
the
early
education
of
his
son
the
young
goethe
studied
at
the
universities
of
leipsic
and
strasburg
and
in
entered
upon
the
practise
of
law
at
wetzlar
at
the
invitation
of
karl
august
duke
of
he
went
in
to
live
in
weimar
where
he
held
a
succession
of
political
offices
becoming
the
duke
chief
adviser
from
to
he
traveled
in
italy
and
from
to
directed
the
ducal
theater
at
weimar
he
took
part
in
the
wars
against
france
and
in
the
following
year
began
his
friendship
with
schiller
which
lasted
till
the
death
in
in
he
married
christiane
vulpius
from
about
he
devoted
himself
chiefly
to
literature
and
after
a
life
of
extraordinary
productiveness
died
at
weimar
march
the
most
important
of
goethe
works
produced
before
he
went
to
weimar
were
his
tragedy
gotz
von
berlichingen
which
first
brought
him
fame
and
the
sorrows
of
young
werther
a
novel
which
obtained
enormous
popularity
during
the
sturm
und
drang
period
during
the
years
at
weimar
before
he
knew
schiller
he
began
wilhelm
meister
wrote
the
dramas
iphigenie
egmont
and
torquato
tasso
and
his
reinecke
fuchs
to
the
period
of
his
friendship
with
schiller
belong
the
continuation
of
wilhelm
meister
the
beautiful
idyl
of
hermann
and
dorothea
and
the
roman
elegies
in
the
last
period
between
schiller
death
in
and
his
own
appeared
faust
elective
affinities
his
autobiographical
dichtung
und
wahrheit
poetry
and
truth
his
italian
journey
much
scientific
work
and
a
series
of
treatises
on
german
art
though
the
foregoing
enumeration
contains
but
a
selection
front
the
titles
of
goethe
best
known
writings
it
suffices
to
show
the
extraordinary
fertility
and
versatility
of
his
genius
rarely
has
a
man
of
letters
had
so
full
and
varied
a
life
or
been
capable
of
so
a
development
his
political
and
scientific
activities
though
dwarfed
in
the
eyes
of
our
generation
by
his
artistic
production
yet
showed
the
adaptability
of
his
talent
in
the
most
diverse
directions
and
helped
to
give
him
that
balance
of
temper
and
breadth
of
vision
in
which
he
has
been
surpassed
by
no
genius
of
the
ancient
or
modern
world
the
greatest
and
most
representative
expression
of
powers
is
without
doubt
to
be
found
in
his
drama
of
faust
but
before
dealing
with
goethe
masterpiece
it
is
worth
while
to
say
something
of
the
history
of
the
story
on
which
it
is
founded
the
most
famous
instance
of
the
old
and
widespread
legend
of
the
man
who
sold
his
soul
to
the
devil
the
historical
faust
seems
to
have
been
a
philosopher
who
traveled
about
germany
in
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
making
money
by
the
practise
of
magic
and
pretended
cures
he
died
mysteriously
about
and
a
legend
soon
sprang
up
that
the
devil
by
whose
aid
he
wrought
his
wonders
had
finally
carried
him
off
in
a
life
of
him
appeared
in
which
are
attributed
to
him
many
marvelous
exploits
and
in
which
he
is
held
up
as
an
awful
warning
against
the
excessive
desire
for
secular
learning
and
admiration
for
antique
beauty
which
characterized
the
humanist
movement
of
the
time
in
this
aspect
the
faust
legend
is
an
expression
of
early
popular
protestantism
and
of
its
antagonism
to
the
scientific
and
classical
tendencies
of
the
renaissance
while
a
succession
of
faust
books
were
appearing
in
germany
the
original
life
was
translated
into
english
and
dramatized
by
marlowe
english
players
brought
marlowe
work
back
to
germany
where
it
was
copied
by
german
actors
degenerated
into
spectacular
farce
and
finally
into
a
puppet
show
through
this
puppet
show
goethe
made
acquaintance
with
the
legend
by
the
time
that
goethe
was
twenty
the
faust
legend
had
fascinated
his
imagination
for
three
years
before
he
went
to
weimar
he
had
been
working
on
scattered
scenes
and
bits
of
dialogue
and
though
he
suspended
actual
composition
on
it
during
three
distinct
periods
it
was
always
to
resume
and
he
closed
his
labors
upon
it
only
with
his
life
thus
the
period
of
time
between
his
first
experiments
and
the
final
touches
is
more
than
sixty
years
during
this
period
the
plans
for
the
structure
and
the
signification
of
the
work
inevitably
underwent
profound
modifications
and
these
have
naturally
affected
the
unity
of
the
result
but
on
the
other
hand
this
long
companionship
and
persistent
recurrence
to
the
task
from
youth
to
old
age
have
made
it
in
a
unique
way
the
record
of
goethe
personality
in
all
its
richness
and
diversity
the
drama
was
given
to
the
public
first
as
a
fragment
in
then
the
completed
first
part
appeared
in
and
finally
the
second
part
was
published
in
the
year
after
the
author
death
writing
in
dichtung
und
wahrheit
of
the
period
about
when
he
was
in
strasburg
with
herder
goethe
says
the
significant
legend
echoed
and
buzzed
in
many
tones
within
me
i
too
had
drifted
about
in
all
knowledge
and
early
enough
had
been
brought
to
feel
the
vanity
of
it
i
too
had
made
all
sorts
of
experiments
in
life
and
had
always
come
back
more
unsatisfied
and
more
tormented
i
was
now
carrying
these
things
like
many
others
about
with
me
and
delighting
myself
with
them
in
lonely
hours
but
without
writing
anything
down
without
going
into
the
details
of
the
experience
which
underlies
these
words
we
can
see
the
be
ginning
of
that
sympathy
with
the
hero
of
the
old
story
that
was
the
basis
of
its
fascination
and
that
accounted
for
goethe
departure
from
the
traditional
catastrophe
of
faust
damnation
of
the
elements
in
the
finished
faust
that
are
derived
from
the
legend
a
rough
idea
may
be
obtained
from
the
doctor
faustus
of
marlowe
printed
in
the
present
volume
as
early
as
a
life
of
faust
had
contained
the
incident
of
the
philosopher
falling
in
love
with
a
but
the
developed
story
of
gretchen
is
own
the
other
elements
added
to
the
plot
can
be
noted
by
a
comparison
with
marlowe
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
goethe
faust
does
not
derive
its
greatness
from
its
conformity
to
the
traditional
standards
of
what
a
tragedy
should
be
he
himself
was
accustomed
to
refer
to
it
cynically
as
a
monstrosity
and
yet
he
put
himself
into
it
as
intensely
as
dante
put
himself
into
the
divine
comedy
a
partial
explanation
of
this
apparent
contradiction
in
the
attitude
is
to
be
found
in
what
has
been
said
of
its
manner
of
composition
goethe
began
it
in
his
romantic
youth
and
availed
himself
recklessly
of
the
supernatural
elements
in
the
legend
with
the
disregard
of
reason
and
plausibility
characteristic
of
the
romantic
mood
when
he
returned
to
it
in
the
beginning
of
the
new
century
his
artistic
standards
had
changed
and
the
supernaturalism
could
now
be
tolerated
only
by
being
made
symbolic
thus
he
makes
the
career
of
faust
as
a
whole
emblematic
of
the
triumph
of
the
persistent
striving
for
the
ideal
over
the
temptation
to
find
complete
satisfaction
in
the
sense
and
prepares
the
reader
for
this
interpretation
by
prefixing
the
prologue
in
heaven
the
elaboration
of
this
symbolic
element
is
responsible
for
such
scenes
as
the
walpurgis
night
and
the
intermezzo
scenes
full
of
power
and
infinitely
suggestive
but
destructive
of
the
unity
of
the
play
as
a
tragedy
of
human
life
yet
there
remains
in
this
first
part
even
in
its
final
form
much
that
is
realistic
in
the
best
sense
the
carousal
in
auerbach
cellar
the
portrait
of
martha
the
walk
the
character
and
fate
of
margaret
it
is
such
elements
as
these
that
have
appealed
to
the
larger
reading
public
and
that
have
naturally
been
emphasized
by
performance
on
the
stage
and
by
virtue
of
these
alone
faust
may
rank
as
a
great
drama
but
it
is
the
result
of
goethe
broodings
on
the
mystery
of
human
life
shadowed
forth
in
the
symbolic
parts
and
elaborated
with
still
greater
complexity
and
still
more
suggestiveness
and
it
must
be
added
with
deepening
obscurity
in
the
second
part
that
have
given
the
work
its
place
with
job
with
the
prometheus
bound
with
the
divine
comedy

hadst
thou
not

him

he
names
it

doth
so
use
it
than
brutes
more
brutish
still
to

with

to

he
seems
to
me
like
any

ever
flies

flying
springs
and
in

its
ancient
ditty
sings
would
he

always
in

repose

the

hast
thou
naught

is
nothing

thou
my

faust
mephistopheles
the

the
lord
right
mephistopheles
he
serves
thee
truly
in
a
wondrous
fashion
poor
fool
his
food
and
drink
are
not
of
earth
an
inward
impulse
hurries
him
afar
himself
half
conscious
of
his
frenzied
mood
from

claimeth
he
the
fairest
star
and
from
the
earth
craves
every
highest
good
and
all
that
near
and
all
that
far
fails
to
allay
the
tumult
in

the

though
in

he
serves
me
now
i
soon
will
lead
him
where
more
light
appears
when
buds
the
sapling
doth
the

know
that
flowers
and
fruit
will
deck
the
coming
years
mephistopheles
what
wilt
thou
wager
him
thou
yet
shall
lose
if
leave
to
me
thou
wilt
but
give
gently
to
lead
him
as
i
choose
the
lord
so
long
as
he
on
earth
doth
live
so
long
is
not
forbidden
thee
man
still
must
err
while
he
doth
strive
mephistopheles
i
thank
you
for
not
willingly
i
traffic
with
the
dead
and
still
aver
that
youth
plump
blooming
cheek
i
very
much
prefer
i
not
at
home
to
corpses
is
my
way
like
cats
with
captive

to
toy

the
lord
enough
is
granted
thee
divert
this
mortal
spirit
from
his
primal
source
him
canst
thou
seize
thy
power
exert
and
lead
him
on
thy
downward
course
then
stand
abash
when
thou
perforce
must
own
a
good
man
in
his
darkest
aberration
of
the
right
path
is
conscious
still
mephistopheles
done
full
soon
see
my
exultation
as
for
my
bet
no
fears
i
entertain
and
if
my
end
i
finally
should
gain
excuse
my
triumphing
with
all
my
soul
dust
he
shall
eat
ay

with

take

did
my

if
your

should
be
an
actor
too
as
not
improbably
may
come
to
pass
wagner
when
in
his
study
pent
the
whole
year
through
man
views
the
world
as
through
an
optic
glass
on
a
chance
holiday
and
scarcely
then
how
by
persuasion
can
he
govern
men
faust
if
feeling
prompt
not
if
it
doth
not
flow
fresh
from
the
spirit
depths
with
strong
control
swaying
to
rapture
every
listener

idle
your
toil
the
chase
you
may
forego
brood
your
task
together
glue
cook
from
another
feast
your
own
ragout
still
prosecute
your
paltry
game
and
fan
your
into

children
wonder
you
excite
and
apes
if
such
your
appetite
but
that
which
issues
from
the
heart
alone
will
bend
tile

of

to
your

wagner
the

will
find

tinkling
fool
sound
understanding
judgment
true
find
utterance
without
art

and
when
in

you
are
moved
to
speak
then
is
it
needful
cunning
words
to
seek
your
fine
harangues
so
polish
in
their
kind
wherein
the
shreds
of
human
thought
ye
twist
are
unrefreshing
as

whistling
through
wither

wagner
oh
god
how
long
is
art
our
life
how
short
with
earnest
zeal
still
as
i
ply
the
critic
task
i
feel
a
strange
oppression
both
of
head
and
heart
the
very
means
how
hardly
are
they
won
by
which
we
to
the
fountains
rise
and
haply
ere
one
half
the
course
is
run
check
in
his
progress
the
poor
devil
dies
faust
parchment
is
that
the
sacred
fount
whence
roll
waters
he
thirsteth
not
who
once
hath
quaffed
oh
if
it
gush
not
from
thine
inmost
soul
thou
has
not
won
the
draught
wagner
your
pardon
is
delightful
to
transport
oneself
into
the
spirit
of
the
past
to
see
in
times
before
us
how
a
wise
man
thought
and
what
a
glorious
height
we
have
achieved
at
last
faust
ay
truly
even
to
the
loftiest
star
to
us
my
friend
the
ages
that
are
a
book
with
seven
seals
are
and
what
the
spirit
of
the
times
men
call
is
merely
their
own
spirit
after
all
wherein
distorted
oft
the
times
are
glass
then
truly
is
a
sight
to
grieve
the
soul
at
the
first
glance
we
fly
it
in
dismay
a
very
a
at
best
a
sort
of
play
with
saws
pragmatical
and
maxims
sage
to
suit
the
puppets
and
their
mimic
stage
wagner
but
then
the
world
and
man
his
heart
and
brain
touching
these
things
all
men
would
something
know
faust
ay
what
men
as
knowledge
doth
obtain
who
on
the
child
its
true
name
dares
bestow
the
few
who
somewhat
of
these
things
have
known
who
their
full
hearts
unguardedly
reveal
nor
thoughts
nor
feelings
from
the
mob
conceal
have
died
on
crosses
or
in
flames
been
excuse
me
friend
far
now
the
night
is
spent
for
this
time
we
must
say
adieu
wagner
still
to
watch
on
i
had
been
well
content
thus
to
converse
so
learnedly
with
you
but
as
will
be
some
further
questions
grant
i
pray
with
diligence
to
study
still
i
fondly
cling
already
i
know
much
but
would
know
everything
exit
faust
alone
how
him
alone
all
hope
abandons
never
to
empty
trash
who
clings
with
zeal
untired
with
greed
for
treasure
gropes
and
exults
if
second
his
endeavour
and
dare
a
voice
of
merely
human
birth
here
where
shapes
immortal
throng
intrude
yet
ah
thou
poorest
of
the
sons
of
earth
for
once
i
to
thee
feel
gratitude
despair
the
power
of
sense
did
blast
and
thou
didst
save
me
ere
i
sank
dismay
so
the
vision
seem
so
vast
i
felt
myself
shrink
dwarf
as
i
survey
i
god
own
image
from
this
toil
of
clay
already
freed
with
eager
joy
who
the
mirror
of
eternal
truth
unveil
mid
light
effulgent
and
celestial
day
i
more
than
cherub
whose
unfetter
soul
with
penetrative
glance
aspir
to
flow
through
nature
veins
and
still
creating
know
the
life
of

how
am
i
punish
now
one
hath
hurl
me
from
the
goal
spirit
i
dare
not
lift
me
to
thy
sphere
what
though
my
power
compell
thee
to
appear
my
art
was
powerless
to
detain
thee
here
in
that
great
moment
i
felt
myself
so
small
so
great
fiercely
didst
thrust
me
from
the
realm
of
thought
back
on
humanity
uncertain
fate
who
teach
me
now
what
ought
ito

i
that
impulse
to
obey

our
every
deed
as
well
as
every
woe
impedes
the
tenor
of

onward
way
to
the

some
feelings

of
baser
quality
and
when
the

of

are

is
termed
a

a
lie
our
aspirations

as
on

with

that
thy

sought
the

of

in
the

ye
here

with
this
sweet
strain
familiar
when
a

was
bliss
a
yearning
impulse
undefin

oh
thou
in

how
little
either

of
such

deserves
the

my
sire
of
good
repute
and
sombre
mood

and
every
mystic
zone
with
honest
zeal
but
methods
of
his
own
with

fantastic
loved
to
brood
his
time
in
dark
alchemic
cell
with

adepts
he
would
spend
and
there
antagonists
compel
through
numberless
receipts
to
blend
a
ruddy
lion
there
a

none

more
fiercely
than

the
deadly
poison

i

must
live
to

the

wagner
why
let
this

can
man
do
more
than
with

skill
with
firm
and
conscientious
will
practise
the
art
transmitted
from
the
past
if
thou
thy
sire
dost
honour
in
thy
youth
his
lore
thou
gladly
wilt
receive
in
manhood
dost
thou
spread
the
bounds
of
truth
then
may
thy
son
a
higher
goal
achieve
faust
how
blest
in
whom
the
fond
desire
from
error
sea
to
rise
hope
still
renews
what
a
man
knows
not
that
he
doth
require
and
what
he
knoweth
that
he
can
not
use
but
let
not
moody
thoughts
their
shadow
throw
the
calm
beauty
of
this
hour
serene
in
the
rich
sunset
see
how
brightly
glow
yon
cottage

girt
round
with
verdant
green
slow
sinks
the
orb
the
day
is
now
no

yonder
he
hastens
to
diffuse
new
life
oh
for
a
pinion
from
the
earth
to
soar
and
after
ever
after
him
to
strive
then
should
i
see
the
world
below
bathed
in
the
deathless
the
vales
reposing
every
height
the
silver
brooklets
meeting
golden
streams
the
savage
mountain

its
cavern

godlike
progress

the
ocean

warm
bays
heaving
with
a
tranquil
motion
to
my
rapt
vision
opes
its
ample
tide
but
now
at
length
the
god

to
sink

impulse

my
flight
onward
i
press
his
quenchless
light
to
drink
the
day
before
me
and
behind
the
night
the
pathless
waves
beneath

over
me
the

vanish

the
parting
day
alas
that
when
on
we
rise
no
wing
material
lifts
our
mortal
clay
but
is
our
inborn
impulse
deep
and
strong
upwards
and
onwards
still
to
urge
our
flight
when
far
above
us
pours
its
thrilling
song
the
lost
in
azure
light
when
on
extended
wing
amain
height
the
eagle
soars
and
over
moor
and
lake
the
crane
still
striveth
towards
its
native
shores
wagner
to
strange
conceits
oft
i
myself
must
own
but
impulse
such
as
this
i

known
nor
woods
nor

can
long
our

engage
their

i

not
the
feather
kind
far
otherwise
the
pleasures

us
from

to

from

then
winter
nights
grow
cheerful
keen
delight
warms
every
limb
and
ah
when
we
unroll
some
old
and
precious
parchment
at
the
sight
all
heaven
itself
descends
upon
the
soul
faust
thy
heart
by
one
sole
impulse

unconscious

two
souls

struggle
there
for
undivided

to
the
world
with
obstinate
desire
and
organs

above

mist
the
other
doth
aspire
with
sacred
vehemence
to
purer
spheres
oh
are
there
spirits
in
the
air
who
float
heaven
and
earth
dominion
wielding
stoop
hither
from
your
golden
atmosphere
lead
me
to
scenes
new
life
and
fuller
yielding
a
magic
mantle
did
i
but
possess
abroad
to
waft
me
as
on
viewless
wings
i
prize
it
far
beyond
the
costliest
dress
nor
would
i
change
it
for
the
robe
of
kings
wagner
call
not
the
spirits
who
on
mischief
wait
their
troop
familiar
streaming
through
the
air
from
every
quarter
threaten
man
estate
and
danger
in
a
thousand
forms
prepare
they
drive
impetuous
from
the
frozen
north
with
fangs
and
keen
arrowy
tongue
from
the
ungenial
east
they
issue
forth
and
prey
with
parching
breath
upon
thy
lungs
if
waft
on
the
desert
flaming
wing
they
from
the
south
heap
fire
upon
the
brain
refreshment
from
the
west
at
first
they
bring
anon
to
drown
thyself
and
field
and
plain
in
wait
for
mischief
they
are
prompt
to
hear
with
guileful
purpose
our
behests
obey
like
ministers
of
grace
they
oft
appear
and
lisp
like
angels
to
betray

let
us
hence
grey
eve
doth
all
things
blend
the
air
grows
chill
the
mists
descend
is
in
the
evening
first
our
home
we
prize
why
stand
you
thus
and
gaze
with
wondering
eyes
what
in
the
gloom
thus
moves
you
faust
yon
black
hound
thou
through
corn
and
stubble
scampering
round
wagner
i
mark
him
long
naught
strange
in
him
i
see
faust
note
him
what
takest
thou
the
brute
to
be
wagner
but
for
a
poodle
whom
his
instinct
serves
his
master
track
to
find
once
more
faust
dost
mark
how
round
us
with
wide
spiral
curves
he
wheels
each
circle
closer
than
before
and
if
i
err
not
he
appears
to
me
a
line
of
fire
upon
his
track
to
leave
wagner
naught
but
a
poodle
black
of
hue
i
see
some
illusion
doth
your
sight
deceive
faust
methinks
a
magic
coil
our
feet
around
he
for
a
future
snare
doth
lightly
spread
wagner
faust
the
circle
narrows
he
already
near
wagner
a
dog
dost
see
no
spectre
have
we
here
he
growls
doubts
lays
him
on
his
belly
too
and
wags
his
tail
as
dogs
are
wont
to
do
faust
come
hither
sirrah
join
our
company
wagner
a
very
poodle
he
appears
to
be
thou
standest
still
for
thee
he
wait
thou
to
him
he
fawns
upon
thee
straight
aught
thou
mayst
lose
again
he
bring
and
for
thy
stick
will
into
water
spring
faust
right
indeed
no
traces
now
i
see
whatever
of
a
spirit
agency
is
nothing
more
wagner
a
dog
well
taught
by
the
wisest
of
us
may
be
sought
ay
to
your
favour
he
entitled
too
apt
scholar
of
the
students
is
his
due
they
enter
the
gate
of
the
town
study
faust
entering
with
the
poodle
now
field
and
meadow
i
forsaken
them
deep
night
her
veil
doth
draw
in
us
the
better

waken
with
feelings
of
foreboding

all
lawless
promptings

unholy
now

us
wholly

peace
scamper
not
thus
obey
me
why
at
the
threshold
snuffest
thou
so
behind
the
stove
now
quietly
lay
thee
my
softest
cushion
to
thee
i

as

taper
gloweth
once
more
within

then
in

itself
that

the
darkness
doth
dispel

her

resumes
returneth

bloom
with
promise
rife
for

the

yearneth
ah
for
the
very
fount
of

poodle
snarl
not
with
the
tone
that
arises
hallow
and
peaceful
my
soul
within
accords
not
thy
growl
thy
bestial
din
we
find
it
not
strange
that
man
despises
what
he
conceives
not
that
he
the
good
and
fair
misprizes
finding
them
often
beyond
his
ken
will
the
dog
snarl
at
them
like
men
but
ah
despite
my
will
it
stands
confessed
contentment
welleth
up
no

wherefore
must
the
stream
alas
so
soon
be
dry
that
we
once
more
athirst

lie
full
oft
this
sad
experience
hath
been
mine
nathless
the
want

of
compensation
for

faust
thy

mephistopheles

so
low
who
undeluded
by

would
penetrate
alone
faust
with

the

it

mystery
in

lies
mephistopheles
the

thou

to
hold
the

with

him
in

but
that
this

the

passed
tooth
of

the

must
clear
i
need
not

long
it

hitherward
and
soon
my
voice
will
hear
the
master
of
the
rats
and
mice
of
flies
and
frogs
of
bugs
and
lice
commands
thy
presence
without

come
forth
and
gnaw
the
threshold
here
where
he
with
oil
has
smear
thou
hopping
forth
already
now
to
work
the
point
that
holds
me
bound
is
in
the
outer
angle
found
another
bite
so
now
is
done
now
faustus
till
we
meet
again
dream
on
faust
awaking
am
i
once
more
deluded
must
i
deem
that
thus
the
throng
of
spirits
disappear
the
devil
presence
was
it
but
a
dream
hath
but
a
poodle
scap
and
left
me
here
study
faust
mephistopheles
faust
a
knock
come
in
who
now
would
break
my
rest
mephistopheles
i
faust
come
in
mephistopheles
thrice
be
the
words
express
faust
then
i
repeat
come
in
mephistopheles
well
i
hope
that
we
shall
soon
agree
for
now
your
fancies
to
expel
here
as
a
youth
of
high
degree
i
come
in
scarlet
vest
and
mantle
richly
dress
a
cock
gay
feather
for
a
plume
a
long
and
pointed
rapier
too
and
briefly
i
would
counsel
you
to
don
at
once
the
same
costume
and
free
from
trammels
speed
away
that
what
life
is
you
may
essay
faust
in
every
garb
i
needs
must
feel
oppress
my
heart
to
earth
low
cares
a
prey
too
old
the
trifler
part
to
play
too
young
to
live
by
no
desire
possess
what
can
the
world
to
me
afford
renounce
renounce
is
still
the
word
this
is
the
everlasting
song
in
every
ear
that
ceaseless
rings
and
which
alas
our
whole
life
long
hoarsely
each
passing
moment
sings
but
to
new
horror
i
awake
each
morn
and
i
could
weep
hot
tears
to
see
the
sun
dawn
on
another
day
whose
round
forlorn
accomplishes
no
wish
of
mine
not
one
which
still
with
froward
captiousness
impains
the
presentiment
of
every
joy
while
low
realities
and
paltry
cares
the
spirit
fond
imaginings
destroy
then
must
i
too
when
falls
the
veil
of
night
stretch
on
my
pallet
languish
in
despair
appalling
dreams
my
soul
affright
no
rest
vouchsafed
me
even
there
the
god
who
throned
within
my
breast
resides
deep
in
my
soul
can
stir
the
springs
with
sovereign
sway
my
energies
he
guides
he
can
not
move
external
things
and
so
existence
is
to
me
a
weight
death
fondly
i
desire
and
life
i
hate
mephistopheles
and
yet
methinks
by
most
be
that
death
is
never
quite
a
welcome
guest
faust
happy
the
man
around
whose
brow
he
binds
the
bloodstain
wreath
in
conquest
dazzling
hour
or
whom
excited
by
the
dance
he
finds
dissolv
in
bliss
in
love
delicious
bower
o
that
before
the
lofty
spirit
might
enraptured
i
had
rendered
up
my
soul
mephistopheles
yet
did
a
certain
man
refrain
one
night
of
its
brown
juice
to
drain
the
crystal
bowl
faust
to
play
the
spy

then
mephistopheles
i
own

not
omniscient
much
to
me

me

mephistopheles
such
a

me
not

i

linger
awhile
so

mayst
thou

me
straightway
then
to

mephistopheles

one
thing
puzzles
me
my
friend
time
short
art
long
methinks
fit
that
you
to
friendly
counsel
should
attend
a
poet
choose
as
your
ally
let
him
thought
wide
dominion
sweep
each
good
and
noble
quality
upon
your
honoured
brow
to
heap
the
lion
magnanimity
the
fleetness
of
the
hind
the
fiery

of
italy
the
northern
stedfast
mind
let
him
to
you
the
mystery
show
to
blend
high
aims
and
cunning
low
and
while
youth
passions
are
aflame
to
fall
in
love
by
rule
and
plan
i
fain
would
meet
with
such
a
man
would
him
sir
microcosmus
name
faust
what
then
am
i
if
i
aspire
in
vain
the
crown
of
our
humanity
to
gain
towards
which
my
every
sense
doth
strain
mephistopheles
after
all
just
what
thou
art
put
on
thy
head
a
wig
with
countless
locks
and
to
a
cubit
height
upraise
thy
socks
still
thou
remainest
ever
what
thou
art
faust
i
feel
it
i
have
heap
upon
my
brain
the
gather
treasure
of
man
thought
in
vain
and
when
at
length
from
studious
toil
i
rest
no
power
springs
up
within
my
breast
a
hair
breadth
is
not
added
to
my
height
i
am
no
nearer
to
the
infinite
mephistopheles
good
sir
these
things
you
view
indeed
just
as
by
other
men
they
view
we
must
more
cleverly
proceed
before
life
joys
our
grasp
elude
the
devil
thou
hast
hands
and
feet
and
head
and
heart
are
also
thine
what
i
enjoy
with
relish
sweet
is
it
on
that
account
less
mine
if
for
six
stallions
i
can
pay
do
i
not
own
their
strength
and
speed
a
proper
man
i
dash
away
as
their
two
dozen
legs
were
mine
indeed
up
then
from
idle
pondering
free
and
forth
into
the
world
with
me
i
tell
you
what
your
speculative
churl
is
like
a
beast
which
some
ill
spirit
leads
on
barren
wilderness
in
ceaseless
whirl
while
all
around
lie
fair
and
verdant
meads
faust
but
how
shall
we
begin
mephistopheles
we
will
go
hence
with
speed
a
place
of
torment
this
indeed
a
precious
life
thyself
to
bore
and
some
few
youngsters
evermore
leave
that
to
neighbour
paunch
withdraw
why
wilt
thou
plague
thyself
with
thrashing
straw
the
very
best
that
thou
dost
know
thou
not
to
the
striplings
show
one
in
the

now
doth
wait
faust
i
in
no
mood
to
see
him
now
mephistopheles
poor
lad
he
must
be
tired
i
trow
he
must
not
go
disconsolate
hand
me
thy
cap
and
gown
the
mask
is
for
my
purpose
quite
first
rate
he
changes
his
dress
now
leave
it
to
my
wit
i
ask
but
quarter
of
an
hour
meanwhile
equip
and
make
all
ready
for
our
pleasant
trip
exit
faust
mephistopheles
in
faust
long

mortal
the
loftiest
attributes
of

reason
and
knowledge
only
thus
contemn
still
let
the
prince
of
lies
without
control
with
shows
and
mocking
charms
delude
thy
soul
i
have
thee
unconditionally
then
fate
hath
endow
him
with
an
ardent
mind
which
unrestrain
still
presses
on
for
ever
and
whose
precipitate
endeavour
earth
joys
leaveth
them
behind
him
will
i
drag
through
life
wild
waste
through
scenes
of
vapid
dulness
where
at
last
bewilder
he
shall
falter
and
stick
fast
and
still
to
mock
his
greedy
haste
viands
and
drink
shall
float
his
craving
lips
beyond
vainly
he
seek
refreshment
and
were
he
not
the
devil
by
his
bond
yet
must
his
soul
infallibly
be
lost
a
student
enters
student
but
recently
i
quitted
home
full
of
devotion
am
i
come
a
man
to
know
and
hear
whose
name
with
reverence
is
known
to
fame
mephistopheles
your
courtesy
much
flatters
me
a
man
like
other
men
you
see
pray
have
you
yet
applied
elsewhere
student
i
would
entreat
your
friendly
care
i
youthful
blood
and
courage
high
of
gold
i
bring
a
fair
supply
to
let
me
go
my
mother
was
not
fain
but
here
i
longed
true
knowledge
to
attain
mephistopheles
you
hit
upon
the
very
place
student
and
yet
my
steps
i
would
retrace
these
walls
this
melancholy
room
me
with
a
sense
of
gloom
the
space
is
narrow
nothing
green
no
friendly
tree
is
to
be
seen
and
in
these
halls
with
benches
filled
distraught
sight
hearing
fail
me
and
the
power
of
thought
mephistopheles
it
all
depends
on
habit
thus
at
first
the
infant
takes
not
kindly
to
the
breast
but
before
long
its
eager
thirst
is
fain
to
slake
with
hearty
zest
thus
at
the
breasts
of
wisdom
day
by
day
with
keener
relish
you
your
thirst
allay
student
upon
her
neck
i
fain
would
hang
with
joy
to
reach
it
say
what
means
must
i
employ
mephistopheles
explain
ere
further
time
we
lose
what
special
faculty
you
choose
student
profoundly
learned
i
would
grow
what
heaven
contains
would
comprehend
earth
wide
realm
my
gaze
extend
nature
and
science
i
desire
to
know
mephistopheles
you
are
upon
the
proper
track
i
find
take
heed
let
nothing
dissipate
your
mind
student
my
heart
and
soul
are
in
the
chase
though
to
be
sure
i
fain
would
seize
on
pleasant
summer
holidays
a
little
liberty
and
careless
ease
mephistopheles
use
well
your
time
so
rapidly
it
flies
method
will
teach
you
time
to
win
hence
my
young
friend
i
would
advise
with
college
logic
to
begin
then
will
your
mind
be
so
well
braced
in
spanish
boots
so
tightly
laced
that
on
circumspectly
creep
thought
beaten
track
securely
keep
nor
will
it
like
into
the
path
of
error
strike
then
many
a
day
they
teach
you
how
the
mind
spontaneous
acts
till
now
as
eating
and
as
drinking
free
require
a
process
one
two
three
in
truth
the
subtle
web
of
thought
is
like
the
weaver
fabric
wrought
one
treadle
moves
a
thousand
lines
swift
dart
the
shuttles
to
and
fro
unseen
the
threads
together
flow
a
thousand
knots
one
stroke
combines
then
forward
steps
your
sage
to
show
and
prove
to
you
it
must
be
so
the
first
being
so
and
so
the
second
the
third
and
fourth
deduc
we
see
and
if
there
were
no
first
and
second
nor
third
nor
fourth
would
ever
be
this
scholars
of
all
countries
prize
yet
themselves
no
weavers
he
who
would
know
and
treat
of
aught
alive
seeks
first
the
living
spirit
thence
to
drive
then
are
the
lifeless
fragments
in
his

there
only
fails
alas
the
this
process

thesis
mocking
themselves
naturer
encheiresis
student
your
words
i
can
not
fully
comprehend
mephistopheles
in
a
short
time
you
will
improve
my
friend
when
of
scholastic
forms
you
learn
the
use
and
how
by
method
all
things
to
reduce
student
so
doth
all
this
my
brain
confound
as
if
a
there
were
turning
round
mephistopheles
and
next
before
aught
else
you
learn
you
must
with
zeal
to
metaphysics
turn
there
see
that
you
profoundly
comprehend
what
doth
the
limit
of
man
brain
transcend
for
that
which
is
or
is
not
in
the
head
a
sounding
phrase
will
serve
you
in
good
stead
but
before
all
strive
this
half
year
from
one
fix
order
to
swerve
five
lectures
daily
you
must
hear
the
hour
still
punctually
observe
yourself
with
studious
zeal
prepare
and
closely
in
your
manual
look
hereby
may
you
be
quite
aware
that
all
he
utters
standeth
in
the
book
yet
write
away
without
cessation
as
at
the
holy
ghost
dictation
student
this
sir
a
second
time
you
need
not
say
your
counsel
i
appreciate
quite
what
we
possess
in
black
and
white
we
can
in
peace
and
comfort
bear
away
mephistopheles
a
faculty
i
pray
you
name
student
for
jurisprudence
some
distaste
i
own
mephistopheles
to
me
this
branch
of
science
is
well
known
and
hence
i
can
not
your
repugnance
blame
customs
and
laws
in
every
place
like
a
disease
an
dread
still
trail
their
curse
from
race
to
race
and
furtively
abroad
they
spread
to
nonsense
reason
self
they
turn
beneficence
becomes
a
pest
woe
unto
thee
that
a
grandson
born
as
for
the
law
born
with
us
unexpressed
that
law
alas
none
careth
to
discern
student
you
deepen
my
dislike
the
youth
whom
you
instruct
is
blest
in
sooth
to
try
theology
i
feel
inclined
mephistopheles
i
would
not
lead
you
willingly
astray
but
as
regards
this
science
you
will
find
so
hard
it
is
to
shun
the
erring
way
and
so
much
hidden
poison
lies
therein
which
scarce
can
you
discern
from
medicine
here
too
it
is
the
best
to
listen
but
to
one
and
by
the
master
words
to
swear
alone
to
sum
up
all
to
words
hold
fast
then
the
safe
gate
securely
pass
you
reach
the
lane
of
certainty
at
last
student
but
then
some
meaning
must
the
words
convey
mephistopheles
right
but
thought
you
find
of
no
avail
for
there
precisely
where
ideas
fail
a
word
comes
opportunely
into
play
most
admirable
weapons
words
are
found
on
words
a
system
we
securely
ground
in
words
we
can
conveniently
believe
nor
of
a
single
jot
can
we
a
word
bereave
student
your
pardon
for
my
importunity
yet
once
more
must
i
trouble
you
on
medicine
i
thank
you
to
supply
a
pregnant
utterance
or
two
three
years
how
brief
the
appointed
tide
the
field
heaven
knows
is
all
too
wide
if
but
a
friendly
hint
be
thrown
easier
then
to
feel
one
way
mephistopheles
aside
i
weary
of
the
dry
pedantic
tone
and
must
again
the
genuine
devil
play
aloud
of
medicine
the
spirit
caught
with
ease
the
great
and
little
world
you
study
through
that
things
may
then
their
course
pursue
as
heaven
may
please
in
vain
abroad
you
range
through
science
ample
space
each
man
learns
only
that
which
learn
he
can
who
knows
the
moment
to
embrace
he
is
your
proper
man
in
person
you
are
tolerably
made
nor
in
assurance
will
you
be
deficient
acquire
be
not
afraid
others
will
then
esteem
you
a

chiefly
with
the

to
deal
their
thousands
ahs
and
ohs
these
the
sage
doctor
knows
he
only
from
one
point
can
heal
assume
a
decent
tone
of
courteous
ease
you
have
them
then
to
humour
as
you
please
first
a
diploma
must
belief
infuse
that
you
in
your
profession
take
the
lead
you
then
at
once
those
easy
freedoms
use
for
which
another
many
a
year
must
plead
learn
how
to
feel
with
nice
address
the
dainty
wrist
and
how
to
press
with
ardent
furtive
glance
the
slender
waist
to
feel
how
tightly
it
is
laced
student
there
is
some
sense
in
that
one
sees
the
how
and
why
mephistopheles
grey
is
young
friend
all
theory
and
green
of
life
the
golden
tree
student
i
swear
it
seemeth
like
a
dream
to
me
may
i
some
future
time
repeat
my
visit
to
hear
on
what
your
wisdom
grounds
your
views
mephistopheles
command
my
humble
service
when
you
choose

ere
i
retire
one
boon
i
must
solicit
here
is
my
album
do
not
sir
deny
this
token
of
your
favour
mephistopheles
willingly
he
writes
and
returns
the
book
student
reads
eritis
sicut

scientes
bonum
et
malum
he
reverently
closes
the
book
and
retires
mephistopheles
let
but
this
ancient
proverb
be
your
rule
my
cousin
follow
still
the
wily
snake
and
with
your
likeness
to
the
gods
poor
fool
ere
long
be
sure
your

quake
faust

through
thy
gay

despite
my

of

i
need
the
easy
manners
that
insure
success
th
attempt
i
fear
can
succeed
to
mingle
in
the

i
want
address
i
still
have
an
embarrass
air
and
then
i
feel
myself
so
small
with
other

mephistopheles

my
good
friend
will
all
that
needful
give
be

and
thou

the
six

of
a

decrees
to
take

faust
continues
to
gaze
into
the
mirror
mephistopheles
stretching
himself
on
the
settle
and
playing
with
the
whisk
continues
to
speak
here
sit
i
like
a
king
upon
his
throne
my
sceptre
this
the
crown
i
want
alone
the
monkeys
who
have
hitherto
been
making
all
sorts
of
strange
gestures
bring
mephistopheles
a
crown
with
loud
cries
oh
be
so
good
with
sweat
and
with
blood
the
crown
to
lime
they
handle
the
crown
awkwardly
and
break
it
in
two
pieces
with
which
they
skip
about
was
fate
decree
we
speak
and
see
we
hear
and
rhyme
faust
before
the
mirror
woe
me
distraught
i
feel
mephistopheles
pointing
to
the
beasts
and
even
my
own
head
almost
begins
to
reel
the
monkeys
if
good
luck
attend
if
fitly
things
blend
our
jargon
with
thought
and
with
reason
is
fraught
faust
as
above
a
flame
is
kindled
in
my
breast
let
us
begone
nor
linger
here
in
the
same
position
it
now
at
least
must
be
confessed
that
poets
sometimes
are
sincere
the
caldron
begins
to
boil
over
a
great
flame
arises
which
streams
up
the
chimney
the
witch
comes
down
the
chimney
with
horrible
cries
the
witch
ough
ough
ough
ough
accursed
brute
accursed
sow
the
caldron
dost
neglect
for
shame
accursed
brute
to
scorch
the
dame
perceiving
faust
and
mephistopheles
whom
have
we
here
who
sneaking
here
whence
are
ye
come
with
what
desire
the
plague
of
fire
your
bones
consume
she
dips
the
into
the
caldron
and
throws
flames
at
faust
mephistopheles
and
the
monkeys
the
monkeys
whimper
mephistopheles
twirling
the
whisk
which
he
holds
in
his
hand
and
striking
among
the
glasses
and
pots
dash
smash
there
lies
the
glass
there
lies
the
slime
is
but
a
jest
i
but
keep
time
thou
hellish
pest
to
thine
own
chime
while
the
witch
steps
back
in
rage
aind
astonishment
dost
know
me
skeleton
vile
scarecrow
thou
thy
lord
and
master
dost
thou
know
what
holds
me
that
i
deal
not
now
thee
and
thine
apes
a
stunning
blow
no
more
respect
to
my
red
vest
dost
pay
does
my
cock
feather
no
allegiance
claim
have
i
my
visage
masked
must
i
be
forced
myself
to
name
the
witch
master
forgive
this
rude
salute
but
i
perceive
no
cloven
foot
and
your
two
ravens
where
are
they
mephistopheles
this
once
i
must
admit
your
plea
for
truly
i
must
own
that
we
each
other
have
not
seen
for
many
a
day
the
culture
too
that
shapes
the
world
at
last
hath
the
devil
in
its
sphere
embraced
the
northern
phantom
from
the
scene
hath
pass
tail
talons
horns
are
nowhere
to
be
traced
as
for
the
foot
with
which
i
ca
dispense
injure
me
in
company
and
hence
like
many
a
youthful
cavalier
false
calves
i
now
have
worn
for
many
a
year
the
witch
dancing
i
am
beside
myself
with
joy
to
see
once
more
the
gallant
satan
here
mephistopheles
woman
no
more
that
name
employ
the
witch
but
why
what
mischief
hath
it
done
mephistopheles
to
it
now
doth
appertain
but
people
from
the
change
have
nothing
won
rid
of
the
evil
one
the
evil
ones
remain
lord
baron
call
thou
me
so
is
the
matter
good
of
other
cavaliers
the
mien
i
wear
dost
make
no
question
of
my
gentle
blood
see
here
this
is
the
scutcheon
that
i
bear
he
makes
an
unseemly
gesture
the
witch
laughing
immoderately
ha
ha
just
like
yourself
you
are
i
ween
the
same
mad
wag
that
you
have
ever
been
mephistopheles
to
faust
my
friend
learn
this
to
understand
i
pray
to
deal
with
witches
this
is
still
the
way
the
witch
now
tell
me
gentlemen
what
you
desire
mephistopheles
of
your
known
juice
a
goblet
we
require
but
for
the
very
oldest
let
me
ask
double
its
strength
with
years
doth
grow
the
witch
most
willingly
and
here
i
have
a
flask
from
which
i
sipp
myself
ere
now
what
more
it
doth
no
longer
stink
to
you
a
glass
i
joyfully
will
give
aside
if
unprepar
however
this
man
drink
he
hath
not
as
you
know
an
hour
to
live
mephistopheles
he
my
good
friend
with
whom
prosper
well
i
grudge
him
not
the
choicest
of
thy
store
now
draw
thy
circle
speak
thy
spell
and
straight
a
bumper
for
him
pour
the
witch
with
extraordinary
gestures
describes
a
circle
and
places
strange
things
within
it
the
glasses
meanwhile
begin
to
ring
the
caldron
to
sound
and
to
make
music
lastly
she
brings
a
great
book
places
the
monkeys
in
the
circle
to
serve
her
as
a
desk
and
to
hold
the
torches
she
beckons
faust
to
approach
faust
to
mephistopheles
tell
me
to
what
doth
all
this
tend
where
will
these
frantic
gestures
end
this
loathsome
cheat
this
senseless
stuff
i
known
and
hated
long
enough
mephistopheles
mere
mummery
a
laugh
to
raise
pray
do
be
so
fastidious
she
but
as
a
leech
her
plays
that
well
with
you
her
potion
may
agree
he
compels
faust
to
enter
the
circle
the
witch
with
great
emphasis
begins
to
declaim
the
book
this
must
thou
ken
of
one
make
ten
pass
two
and
then
make
square
the
three
so
rich
be
drop
out
the
four
from
five
and
six
thus
says
the
witch
make
seven
and
eight
so
all
is
straight
and
nine
is
one
and
ten
is
none
this
is
the
witch
faust
the
hag
doth
as
in
fever
rave
mephistopheles
to
these
will
follow
many
a
stave
i
know
it
well
so
rings
the
book
throughout
much
time
i
lost
in
puzzling
its
pages
for
downright
paradox
no
doubt
a
mystery
remains
alike
to
fools
and
sages
ancient
the
art
and
modern
too
my
friend
is
still
the
fashion
as
it
used
to
be
error
instead
of
truth
abroad
to
send
by
means
of
three
and
one
and
one
and
three
is
ever
taught
and
babbled
in
the
schools
who
take
the
trouble
to
dispute
with
fools
when
words
men
hear
in
sooth
they
usually
believe
that
there
must
needs
therein
be
something
to
conceive
the
witch
continues
the
lofty
power
of
wisdom
dower
from
all
the
world
conceal
who
thinketh
not
to
him
i
wot
unsought
it
is
reveal
faust
what
nonsense
doth
the
hag
propound
my
brain
it
doth
confound
a
hundred
thousand
fools
or
more
methinks
i
hear
in
chorus
roar
mephistopheles
incomparable
sibyl
cease
i
pray
hand
us
thy
liquor
without
more
delay
and
to
the
very
brim
the
goblet
crown
my
friend
he
is
and
need
not
be
afraid
besides
he
is
a
man
of
many
a
grade
who
bath
drunk
deep
already
the
witch
with
many
ceremonies
pours
the
liquor
into
a
cup
as
faust
lifts
it
to
his
mouth
a
light
flame
arises
mephistopheles
gulp
it
down
no
hesitation
it
will
prove
a
cordial
and
your
heart
inspire
what
with
the
devil
hand
and
glove
and
yet
shrink
back
afraid
of
fire
the
witch
dissolves
the
circle
faust
steps
out
mephistopheles
now
forth
at
once
thou
not
rest
witch
and
much
sir
may
the
liquor
profit
you
mephistopheles
to
the
witch
and
if
to
pleasure
thee
i
aught
can
do
pray
on
walpurgis
mention
thy
request
witch
here
is
a
song
sung
sometimes
you
see
that
a
singular
effect
produce
mephistopheles
to
faust
come
quick
and
let
thyself
be
led
by
me
thou
must
perspire
in
order
that
the
juice
thy
frame
may
penetrate
through
every
part
then
noble
idleness
i
thee
will
teach
to
prize
and
soon
with
ecstasy
recognise
how
cupid
stirs
and
gambols
in
thy
heart
faust
let
me
but
gaze
one
moment
in
the
glass
too
lovely
was
that
female
form
mephistopheles
nay
nay
a
model
which
all
women
shall
surpass
in
flesh
and
blood
ere
long
thou
shalt
survey
as
works
the
draught
thou
presently
shalt
greet
a
helen
in
each
woman
thou
dost
meet
a
street
faust
margaret
passing
by
faust
fair
lady
may
i
thus
make
free
to
offer
you
my
arm
and
company
margaret
i
am
no
lady
am
not
fair
can
without
escort
home
repair
she
disengages
herself
and
exit
faust
by
heaven
this
girl
is
fair
indeed
no
form
like
hers
can
i
recall
virtue
she
hath
and
modest
heed
is
piquant
too
and
sharp
withal
her
cheek
soft
light
her
rosy
lips
no
length
of
time
will
eclipse
her
downward
glance
in
passing
by
deep
in
my
heart
is
stamp
for
aye
how
curt
and
sharp
her
answer
too
to
ecstasy
the
feeling
grew
mephistophzles
enters
faust
this
girl
must
win
for
me
dost
hear
mephistopheles
which
faust
she
who
but
now
passed
mephistopheles
she
from
confession
coineth
here
from
every
sin
absolved
and
free
i
crept
near
the
confessor
chair
all
innocence
her
virgin
soul
for
next
to
nothing
went
she
there
such
as
she
i
no
control
faust
she
past
fourteen
mephistopheles
you
really
talk
like
any
gay
lothario
who
every
floweret
from
its
stalk
would
pluck
and
deems
nor
grace
nor
truth
secure
against
his
arts
forsooth
this
the
less
wo
always
do
faust
sir
moralizer
prithee
pause
nor
plague
me
with
your
tiresome
laws
to
cut
the
matter
short
my
friend
she
must
this
very
night
be
mine
and
if
to
help
me
you
decline
midnight
shall
see
our
compact
end
mephistopheles
what
may
occur
just
bear
in
mind
a
fortnight
space
at
least
i
need
a
fit
occasion
but
to
find
faust
with
but
seven
hours
i
could
succeed
nor
should
i
want
the
devil
wile
so
young
a
creature
to
beguile
mephistopheles
like
any
frenchman
now
you
speak
but
do
not
fret
i
pray
why
seek
to
hurry
to
enjoyment
straight
the
pleasure
is
not
half
so
great
as
when
at
first
around
above
with
all
the
fooleries
of
love
the
puppet
you
can
knead
and
mould
as
in
italian
story
oft
is
told
faust
no
such
incentives
do
i
need
mephistopheles
but
now
without
offence
or
jest
you
can
not
quickly
i
protest
in
winning
this
sweet
child
succeed
by
storm
we
can
not
take
the
fort
to
stratagem
we
must
resort
faust
conduct
me
to
her
place
of
rest
some
token
of
the
angel
bring
a
kerchief
from
her
snowy
breast
a
garter
bring
me
any
thing
mephistopheles
that
i
my
anxious
zeal
may
prove
your
pangs
to
sooth
and
aid
your
love
a
single
moment
will
we
not
delay
will
lead
you
to
her
room
this
very
day
faust
and
shall
i
see
her
have
her
mephistopheles
no
she
to
a
neighbour
house
will
go
but
in
her
atmosphere
alone
the
tedious
hours
meanwhile
you
may
employ
in
blissful
dreams
of
future
joy
faust
can
we
go
now
mephistopheles
yet
too
soon
faust
some
present
for
my
love
procure
exit
mephistopheles
presents
so
soon
is
well
success
is
sure
full
many
a
goodly
place
i
know
and
treasures
buried
long
ago
i
must
a
bit
them
now
exit
evening
a
small
and
neat
room
margaret
braiding
and
binding
up
her
hair
i
would
give
something
now
to
know
who
yonder
gentleman
could
be
he
had
a
gallant
air
i
trow
and
doubtless
was
of
high
degree
that
written
on
his
brow
was
seen
nor
else
would
lie
so
bold
have
been
exit
mephistopheles
come
in
tread
softly
be
discreet
faust
after
a
pause
begone
and
leave
me
i
entreat
mephistopheles
looking
round
not
every
maiden
is
so
neat
faust
gazing
round
welcome
sweet
twilight
calm
and
blest
that
in
this
hallow
precinct
reigns
fond
yearning
love

my
breast
feeding
on
hope
sweet
dew
thy
blissful
pains
what
stillness
here
environs
me
content
and
order
brood
around
what
fulness
in
this
poverty
in
this
small
cell
what
bliss
profound
he
throws
himself
on
the
leather
beside
the
bed
receive
me
thou
who
hast
in
thine
embrace
welcom
in
joy
and
grief
the
ages
flown
how
oft
the
children
of
a
race
have
cluster
round
this
patriarchal
throne
haply
she
also
whom
i
hold
so
dear
for
christmas

with
grateful
joy
possess

i
feel
thy
spirit
haunt
the
place
breathing
of
order
and
abounding
grace
as
with
a
mother
voice
it
prompteth
thee
the
pure
white
cover
the
board
to
spread
to
strew
the
crisping
sand
beneath
thy
tread
dear
hand
so
godlike
in
its
ministry
the
hut
becomes
a
paradise
through
thee
and
here
he
raises
the
how
thrills
my
pulse
with
strange
delight
here
could
i
linger
hours
untold
thou
nature
didst
in
vision

the
embryo
angel
here
unfold
here
lay
the
child
her
bosom
warm
with
life
while
steeped
in
slumber
dew
to
perfect
grace
her
godlike
form
with
pure
and
hallow
weavings
grew
and
thou
ah
here
what
seekest
thou
how
quails
mine
inmost

now
what
wouldst

thy
heart

a
pure
i
melt

the
sport
of
every
passing
gale

return
and

now
how
wouldst
thou
rue
thy
guilty
flame
proud
vaunter
thou
wouldst
hide
thy
brow
and
at
her
feet
sink
down
with
shame
mephistopheles
quick
quick
below
i
see
her
there
faust
away
i
will
return
no
more
mephistopheles
here
is
a
casket
with
a
store
of
jewels
which
i
got
elsewhere
just
lay
it
in
the
press
make
haste
i
swear
to
you
turn
her
brain
therein
some
trifles
i
have
placed
wherewith
another
to
obtain
but
child
is
child
and
play
is
play
faust
i
know
not
shall
i
mephistopheles
do
you
ask
perchance
you
would
retain
the
treasure
if
such
your
wish
why
then
i
say
henceforth
absolve
me
from
my
task
nor
longer
waste
your
hours
of
leisure
i
trust
you
not
by
avarice
led
i
rub
my
hands
i
scratch
my
head
he
places
the
casket
in
the
press
and
closes
the
lock
now
quick
away
that
soon
the
sweet
young
creature
may
the
wish
and
purpose
of
your
heart
obey
yet
stand
you
there
as
would
you
to
the
repair
as
if
before
you
stood
arrayed
in
flesh
and
blood
physics
and
metaphysics
weird
and
grey
away
exeunt
margaret
with
a
lamp
here
is
so
close
so
sultry
now
she
opens
the
window
yet
out
of
doors
is
not
so
warm
i
feel
so
strange
i
know
not
how
i
wish
my
mother
would
come
home
through
me
there
runs
a
shuddering
i
but
a
foolish
timid
thing
while
undressing
herself
she
begins
to
sing
there
was
a
king
in
thule
true
even
to
the
grave
to
whom
his
dying
mistress
a
golden
beaker
gave
at
every
feast
he
drained
it
naught
was
to
him
so
dear
and
often
as
he
drained
it
gush
from
his
eyes
the
tear
when
death
came
unrepining
his
cities
he
told
all
to
his
heir
resigning
except
his
cup
of
gold
with
many
a
knightly
vassal
at
a
royal
feast
sat
he
in
yon
proud
ball
ancestral
in
his
castle
the
sea
up
stood
the
jovial
monarch
and
quaff
his
last
life
glow
then
hurled
the
hallow
goblet
into
the
flood
below
he
saw
it
splashing
drinking
and
plunging
hi
the
sea
his
eyes
meanwhile
were
sinking
and
never
again
drank
he
she
opens
the
press
to
put
away
her
clothes
and
perceives
the
casket
how
comes
this
lovely
casket
here
the
press
i
locked
of
that
i
confident
is
very
wonderful
what
in
it
i
ca
guess
perhaps
was
brought
by
some
one
in
distress
and
left
in
pledge
for
loan
my
mother
lent
here
by
a
ribbon
hangs
a
little
key
i
have
a
mind
to
open
it
and
see
heavens
only
look
what
have
we
here
in
all
my
days
saw
i
such
a
sight
jewels
which
any
noble
dame
might
wear
for
some
high
pageant
richly
dight
this
chain
how
would
it
look
on
me
these
splendid
gems
whose
may
they
be
she
puts
them
on
and
steps
before
the
glass
were
but
the
only
mine
thus
one
has
quite
another
air
what
hoots
it
to
be
young
and
fair
it
doubtless
may
be
very
flue
but
then
alas
none
cares
for
you
and
praise
sounds
half
like
pity
too
gold
all
doth
lure
gold
doth
secure
all
things
alas
we
poor
promenade
faust
walking
thoughtfully
up
and
down
to
him
mephistopheles
mephistopheles
by
all
rejected
love
by
hellish
fire
i
curse
would
i
knew
aught
to
make
my
imprecation
worse
faust
what
aileth
thee
what
chafes
thee
now
so
sore
a
face
like
that
i
never
saw
before
mephistopheles
i
yield
me
to
the
devil
instantly
did
it
not
happen
that
myself
am
he
faust
there
must
be
some
disorder
in
thy
wit
to
rave
thus
like
a
madman
is
it
fit
mephistopheles
think
only
think
the
gems
for
gretchen
brought
them
hath
a
priest
now
made
his
own
a
glimpse
of
them
the
mother
caught
and
with
secret
fear
to
groan
the
woman
scent
is
keen
enough
doth
ever
in
the
snuff
smells
every
article
to
ascertain
whether
the
thing
is
holy
or
profane
and
scented
in
the
jewels
rare
that
there
was
not
much
blessing
there
my
child
she
cries
good
ensnares
the
soul
consumes
the
blood
with
them
we
deck
our
lady
shrine
she
cheer
our
souls
with
bread
divine
at
this
poor
gretchen
to
pout
a
at
least
she
thought
and
sure
he
godless
can
not
be
who
brought
them
here
so
cleverly
straight
for
a
priest
the
mother
sent
who
when
he
understood
the
jest
with
what
he
saw
was
well
content
this
shows
a
pious
mind
quoth
he
is
true
victory
the
church
bath
a
good
stomach
she
with
zest
whole
countries
hath
swallow
down
and
never
yet
a
surfeit
known
the
church
alone
be
it
confessed
daughters
can
wealth
digest
faust
it
is
a
general
custom
too
practised
alike
by
king
and
jew
mephistopheles
with
that
clasp
chain
and
ring
he
swept
as
they
were
mushrooms
and
the
casket
without
one
word
of
thanks
he
kept
as
if
of
nuts
it
were
a
basket
promised
reward
in
heaven
then
forth
he
hied
and
greatly
they
were
edified
faust
and
gretchen
mephistopheles
in
unquiet
mood
knows
neither
what
she
would
or
should
the
trinkets
night
and
day
thinks
on
him
who
brought
them
dwells
still
more
faust
the
darling
sorrow
grieves
me
bring
another
set
without
delay
the
first
methinks
was
no
great
thing
mephistopheles
all
to
my

my
end

hoard
there
for

rather
hungers
rather
begs
than

it
grieves
me
sore
but
he
his
gold
not
lavishly

i
pray
mephistopheles
i
stood
by
his
bedside
something
less
foul
it
was
than
dung
straw
half
rotten
yet
he
as
a
christian
died
and
sorely
hath
remorse
his
conscience
wrung
wretch
that
i
was
quoth
he
with
parting
breath
so
to
forsake
my
business
and
my
wife
ah
the
remembrance
is
my
death
could
i
but
have
her
pardon
in
this
life
martha
weeping
dear
soul
i
long
forgiven
him
indeed
mephistopheles
though
she
god
knows
was
more
to
blame
than
i
martha
he
lied
what
on
the
brink
of
death
to
lie
mephistopheles
if
i
am
skill
the
countenance
to
read
he
doubtless
fabled
as
he
parted
no
time
had
i
to
gape
or
take
my
ease
he
said
first
to
get
children
and
then
get
them
bread
and
bread
too
in
the
very
widest
sense
nor
could
i
eat
in
peace
even
my
proper
share
martha
what
all
my
truth
my
love
forgotten
quite
my
weary
drudgery
by
day
and
night
mephistopheles
not
so
he
thought
of
you
with
tender
care
quoth
he
heaven
knows
how
fervently
i
prayed
for
wife
and
children
when
from
malta
bound
the
prayer
hath
heaven
with
favour
crowned
we
took
a
turkish
vessel
which
conveyed
rich
store
of
treasure
for
the
sultan
court
it
own
reward
our
gallant
action
brought
the
captur
prize
was
shared
among
the
crew
and
of
the
treasure
i
received
my
due
martha
how
where
the
treasure
hath
he
buried
pray
mephistopheles
where
the
four
winds
have
blown
it
who
can
say
in
naples
as
he
stroll
a
stranger
there
a
comely
maid
took
pity
on
my
friend
and
gave
such
tokens
of
her
love
and
care
that
he
retained
them
to
his
blessed
end
martha
scoundrel
to
rob
his
children
of
their
bread
and
all
this
misery
this
bitter
need
could
not
his
course
of
recklessness
impede
mephistopheles
well
he
bath
paid
the
forfeit
and
is
dead
now
were
i
in
your
place
my
counsel
hear
my
weeds
i
wear
for
one
chaste
year
and
for
another
lover
meanwhile
would
look
out
martha
alas
i
might
search
far
and
near
not
quickly
should
i
find
another
like
my
first
there
could
not
be
a
fonder
fool
than
mine
only
he
loved
too
well
abroad
to
roam
loved
foreign
women
too
and
foreign
wine
and
loved
besides
the
dice
accurs
mephistopheles
all
had
gone
swimmingly
no
doubt
had
he
but
given
you
at
home
on
his
side
just
as
wide
a
range
upon
such
terms
to
you
i
swear
myself
with
you
would
gladly
rings
exchange
martha
the
gentleman
is
surely
pleas
to
jest
mephistopiieles

the
very
devil
marry
her
to
margaret

from
a
witness

heard
where
how
and
when
my
husband
died
and
was
interr
to
forms
i
always
been
attached
indeed
his
death
i
fain
would
in
the
journals
read
mephistopheles
ay
madam
what
two
witnesses
declare
is
held
as
valid
everywhere
a
gallant
friend
i
have
not
far
from
here
who
will
for
you
before
the
judge
appear
i
bring
him
straight
martha
i
pray
you
do
mephistopheles
and
this
young
lady
we
shall
find
her
too
a
noble
youth
far
travelled
he
shows
to
the
sex
all
courtesy
margaret
i
in
his
presence
needs
must
blush
for
shame
mephistopheles
not
in
the
presence
of
a
crowned
king
marth
a
the
garden
then
behind
my
house
we
name
there
we
await
you
both
this
evening
a
street
faust
mephistopheles
faust
how
is
it
now
how
speeds
it
in
train
mephistopheles
bravo
i
find
you
all
aflame
gretchen
full
soon
your
own
you
name
this
eve
at
neighbour
martha
her
you
meet
again
the
woman
seems
expressly
made
to
drive
the
pimp
and
gipsy
trade
faust
good
mephistopheles
but
from
us
she
something
would
request
faust
a
favour
claims
return
as
this
world
goes
mephistopheles
we
have
on
oath
but
duly
to
attest
that
her
dead
husband
limbs
outstretch
repose
in
holy
ground
at
padua
faust
sage
indeed
so
i
suppose
we
straight
must
journey
there
mephistopheles
sancta
simplicitas
for
that
no
need
without
much
knowledge
we
have
but
to
swear
faust
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
suggest
against
your
plan
i
must
at
once
protest
mephistopheles
oh
holy
man
methinks
i
have
you
there
in
all
your
life
say
have
you
false
witness
borne
until
this
hour
have
you
of
god
the
world
and
all
it
doth
contain
of
man
and
that
which
worketh
in
his
heart
and
brain
not
definitions
given
in
words
of
weight
and
power
with
front
unblushing
and
a
dauntless
breast
yet
if
into
the
depth
of
things
you
go
touching
these
matters
it
must
be
confess
as
much
as
of
herr
schwerdtlein
death
you
know
faust
thou
art
and
dost
remain
liar
and
sophist
too
mephistopheles
ay
if
one
did
not
take
a
somewhat
deeper
view
in
all
honour
thou
poor
gretchen
wilt
befool
and
vow
thy
soul
deep
love
in
lover
fashion
faust
and
from
my
heart
mephistopheles
all
good
and
fair
then
deathless
constancy
swear
speak
of
one
all
passion
will
that
too
issue
from
the
heart
faust
forbear
when
passion
sways
me
and
i
seek
to
frame
fit
utterance
for
feeling
deep
intense
and
for
my
frenzy
finding
no
fit
name
sweep
round
the
ample
world
with
every
sense
grasp
at
the
loftiest
words
to
speak
my
flame
and
call
the
glow
wherewith
i
burn
quenchless
eternal
yea
eterne
is
that
of
sophistry
a
devilish
play
mephistopheles
yet
am
i
right
faust
mark
this
my
friend
and
spare
my
lungs
who
would
the
right
maintain
and
hath
a
tongue
wherewith
his
point
to
gain
will
gain
it
in
the
end
but
come
of
gossip
i
am
weary
quite
because
i
no

on
faust
arm
martha
with
mephistopheles
walking
up
and
down
margaret
i
feel
it
you
but
spare
my
ignorance
the
gentleman
to
shame
me
stoops
thus
low
a
traveller
from
complaisance
still
makes
the
best
of
things
i
know
too
well
my
humble
prattle
never
can
have
power
to
entertain
so
wise
a
man
faust
one
glance
one
word
from
thee
doth
charm
me
more
than
the
world
wisdom
or
the
sage
lore
he
kisses
her
hand
margaret
nay
trouble
not
yourself
a
hand
so
coarse
so
rude
as
mine
how
can
you
kiss
what
constant
work
at
home
must
i
not
do
perforce
my
mother
too
exacting
is
they
pass
on
martha
thus
sir
unceasing
travel
is
your
lot
mephistopheles
traffic
and
duty
urge
us
with
what
pain
are
we
compelled
to
leave
full
many
a
spot
where
yet
we
dare
not
once
remain
martha
in
youth
wild
years
with
vigour
crown
not
amiss
thus
through
the
world
to
sweep
but
ah
the
evil
days
come
round
and
to
a
lonely
grave
as
bachelor
to
creep
a
pleasant
thing
has
no
one
found
mephistopheles
the
prospect
fills
me
with
dismay
martha
therefore
in
time
dear
sir
reflect
i
pray
they
pass
on
margaret
ay
out
of
sight
is
out
of
mind
politeness
easy
is
to
you
friends
everywhere
and
not
a
few
wiser
than
i
am
you
will
find
faust
o
dearest
trust
me
what
doth
pass
for
sense
full
oft
is
and
blindness
margaret
how
faust
simplicity
and
holy
innocence
when
will
ye
learn
your
worth
to
know
ah
when
will
meekness
and
humility
kind
and
nature
loftiest
dower
margaret
only
one
little
moment
think
of
me
to
think
of
you
i
shall
have
many
an
hour
faust
you
are
perhaps
much
alone
margaret
yes
small
our
household
is
i
own
yet
must
i
see
to
it
no
maid
we
keep
and
i
must
cook
sew
knit
and
sweep
still
early
on
my
feet
and
late
my
mother
is
in
all
things
great
and
small
so
accurate
not
that
for
thrift
there
is
such
pressing
need
than
others
we
might
make
more
show
indeed
my
father
left
behind
a
small
estate
a
house
and
garden
near
the
but
fairly
quiet
now
my
days
i
own
as
soldier
is
my
brother
gone
my
little
sister
dead
the
babe
to
rear
occasion
me
some
care
and
fond
annoy
but
i
would
go
through
all
again
with
joy
the
darling
was
to
me
so
dear
faust
an
angel
sweet
if
it
resembled
thee
margaret
i
reared
it
up
and
it
grew
fond
of
me
after
my
father
death
it
saw
the
day
we
gave
my
mother
up
for
lost
she
lay
in
such
a
wretched
plight
and
then
at
length
so
very
slowly
she
regain
her
strength
weak
as
she
was
was
vain
for
her
to
try
herself
to
suckle
the
poor
babe
so
i
reared
it
on
milk
and
water
all
alone
and
thus
the
child
became
as
roy
own
within
my
arms
it
stretched
itself
and
grew
and
smiling
nestled
in
my
bosom
too
faust
doubtless
the
purest
happiness
was
thine
margaret
but
many
weary
hours
in
sooth
were
also
mine
at
night
its
little
cradle
stood
close
to
my
bed
so
was
i
wide
awake
if
it
but
stirred
one
while
i
was
obliged
to
give
it
food
or
to
my
arms
the
darling
take
from
bed
full
oft
must
rise
its
cry
i
heard
and
dancing
it
must
pace
the
chamber
to
and
fro
stand
at
the
early
forthwith
go
to
market
and
then
mind
the
cooking
too
like
the
whole
year
through
ah
sir
thus
living
it
must
be
one
spirits
are
not
always
of
the
best
yet
it
a
relish
gives
to
food
and
rest
they
pass
on
martha
poor
women
we
are
badly
off
i
own
a
bachelor
conversion
hard
indeed
mephistopheles
madam
with
one
like
you
it
rests
alone
to
tutor
me
a
better
course
to
lead
martha
speak
frankly
sir
none
is
there
you
have
met
has
your
heart
attach
itself
as
yet
mephistopheles
one
own
and
a
good
wife
are
gold
and
pearls
of
price
so
says
the
proverb
old
martha
i
mean
has
passion
never
stirred
your
breast
mephistopheles
i
everywhere
been
well
received
i
own
martha
yet
hath
your
heart
no
earnest
preference
known
mephistopheles
with
ladies
one
should
presume
to
jest
martha
ah
you
mistake
mephistopheles
i
sorry
i
so
blind
but
this
i
know
that
you
are
very
kind
they
pass
on
faust
me
little
angel
didst
thou
recognise
when
in
the
garden
first
i
came
margaret
did
you
not
see
it
i
cast
down
my
eyes
faust
thou
dost
forgive
my
boldness
dost
not
blame
the
liberty
i
took
that
day
when
thou
from
church
didst
lately
wend
thy
way
margaret
i
was
confused
so
had
it
never
been
no
one
of
me
could
any
evil
say
alas
thought
i
he
doubtless
in
thy
mien
something
unmaidenly
or
bold
hath
seen
it
seemed
as
if
it
struck
him
suddenly
here
just
a
girl
with
whom
one
may
make
free
yet
i
must
own
that
then
i
scarcely
knew
what
in
your
favour
here
began
at
once
to
plead
yet
i
was
angry
with
myself
indeed
that
i
more
angry
could
not
feel
with
you
faust
sweet
love
margaret
just
wait
awhile
she
gathers
a
and
plucks
off
the
leaves
one
after
another
faust
a
nosegay
may
that
be
margaret
no
it
is
but
a
game
faust
how
margaret
go
you
laugh
at
me
she
plucks
off
the
leaves
and
murmurs
to
herself
faust
what
murmurest
thou
margaret
half
aloud
he
loves
me
loves
me
not
faust
sweet
angel
with
thy
face
of
heavenly
bliss
margaret
continues
he
loves
me
not
he
loves
me
not
plucking
off
the
last
leaf
with
fond
joy
he
loves
me
faust
yes
and
this
darling
let
it
be
a
heavenly
oracle
he
loveth
thee
thou
the
meaning
of
he
loveth
thee
he
seizes
both
her
hands
margaret
i
tremble
so
faust
nay
do
not
tremble
love
let
this
let
this
glance
reveal
feelings
all
power
of
speech
above
to
give
oneself
up
wholly
and
to
feel
a
joy
that
must
eternal
prove
eternal
yes
its
end
would
be
despair
no
end
it
can
not
end
margaret
presses
his
hand
extricates
herself
and
runs
away
he
stands
a
moment
in
thought
and
then
follows
her
martha
approaching
night
closing
mephistopheles
yes
we
presently
away
martha
i
would
entreat
you
longer
yet
to
stay
but
is
a
wicked
place
just
here
about
it
is
as
if
the
folk
had
nothing
else
to
do
nothing
to
think
of
too
but
gaping
watch
their
neighbours
who
goes
in
and
out
and
scandal
busy
still
do
one
may
and
our
young
couple
mephistopheles
they
have
flown
up
there
the
wanton
butterflies
martha
he
seems
to
take
to
her
mephistopheles
and
she
to
him
is
of
the
world
the
way
a
margaret
runs
in
hides
behind
the
door
holds
the
tip
of
her
finger
to
her
lip
and
peeps
through
the
crevice
margaret
he
comes
faust
ah
little
rogue
so
thou
to
provoke
me
i
have
caught
thee
now
he
kisses
her
margaret
embracing
him
and
returning
the
kiss
dearest
of
men
i
love
thee
from
my
heart
mephistopheles
knocks
who
there
faust
stamping
mephistopheles
a
friend
faust
a
brute
mephistopheles
martha
comes
ay
it
is
late
good
sir
faust
may
i
attend
you
then
margaret
oh
no
my
mother
would
adieu
adieu
faust
and
must
i
really
then
take
leave
of
you
farewell
martha
margaret
ere
long
to
meet
again
exeunt
faust
and
mephistopheles
margaret
good
heavens
how
all
things
far
and
near
must
fill
his
mind
a
man
like
this
abash
before
him
i
appear
and
say
to
all
things
only
yes
poor
simple
child
i
can
not
see
what
is
that
he
can
find
in
me
exit
forest
and
cavern
faust
alone
spirit
sublime
thou
me
me
all
for
which
i
prayed
not
vainly
hast
thou
to
me
thy
countenance
in
flaming
fire
gayest
me
glorious
nature
for
my
realm
and
also
power
to
feel
her
and
enjoy
not
merely
with
a
cold
and
wondering
glance
thou
dost
permit
me
in
her
depths
profound
as
in
the
bosom
of
a
friend
to
gaze
before
me
thou
dost
lead
her
living
tribes
and
dost
in
silent
grove
in
air
and
stream
teach
me
to
know
my
kindred
and
when
roars
the
howling
through
the
groaning
wood
wrenching
the
giant
pine
which
in
its
fall
crashing
sweeps
down
its
neighbour
trunks
and
boughs
while
hollow
thunder
from
the
hill
resounds
then
thou
dost
lead
me
to
some
shelter
cave
dost
there
reveal
me
to
myself
and
show
of
my
own
bosom
the
mysterious
depths
and
when
with
soothing
beam
the
moon
pale
orb
full
in
my
view
climbs
up
the
pathless
sky
from
crag
and
dewy
grove
the
silvery
forms
of
ages
hover
and
assuage
the
joy
austere
of
contemplative
thought
oh
that
naught
perfect
is
assign
to
man
i
feel
alas
with
this
exalted
joy
which
lifts
me
near
and
nearer
to
the
gods
thou
me
this
companion
unto
whom
i
needs
must
cling
though
cold
and
insolent
he
still
degrades
me
to
myself
and
turns
thy
glorious
gifts
to
nothing
with
a
breath
he
in
my
bosom
with
malicious
zeal
for
that
fair
image
fans
a
raging
fire
from
craving
to
enjoyment
thus
i
reel
and
in
enjoyment
languish
for
desire
mephistopheles
enters
mephistopheles
of
this
lone
life
have
you
not
had
your
fill
how
for
so
long
can
it
have
charms
for
you
is
well
enough
to
try
it
if
you
will
but
then
away
again
to
something
new
faust
would
you
could
better
occupy
your
leisure
than
in
disturbing
thus
my
hours
of
joy
mephistopheles
well
well
i
leave
you
to
yourself
with
pleasure
a
serious
tone
you
hardly
dare
employ
to
part
from
one
so
crazy
harsh
and
cross
were
not
in
truth
a
grievous
loss
the
day
for
you
i
toil
and
fret
from
his
worship
face
a
hint
i
get
what
pleases
him
or
what
to
let
alone
faust
ay
truly
that
is
just
the
proper
tone
he
wearies
me
and
would
with
thanks
be
paid
mephistopheles
poor
son
of
earth
without
my
aid
how
would
thy
weary
days
have
flown
thee
of
thy
foolish
whims
i
cured
thy
vain
imaginations
banished
and
but
for
me
be
well
assured
thou
from
this
sphere
must
soon
have
vanished
in
rocky
hollows
and
in
caverns
drear
why
like
an
owl
sit
moping
here
wherefore
from
dripping
stones
and
moss
with
ooze
embued
dost
suck
like
any
toad
thy
food
a
rare
sweet
pastime
verily
the
doctor
cleaveth
still
to
thee
faust
dost
comprehend
what
bliss
without
alloy
from
this
wild
in
the
desert
springs
couldst
thou
but
guess
the
new
it
brings
thou
wouldst
be
fiend
enough
to
envy
me
my
joy
mephistopheles
what
ecstasy
at
night
to
lie
in
darkness
on
the
dewy
height
embracing
heaven
and
earth
in
rapture
high
the
soul
dilating
to
a
deity
with
prescient
yearnings
pierce
the
core
of
earth
feel
in
your
labouring
breast
the
birth
enjoy
in
proud
delight
what
no
one
knows
while
your
creation
flows
the
earthly
lost
in
beatific
vision
and
then
the
lofty
intuition
with
a
gesture
i
need
not
tell
you
how
to
close
faust
fie
on
you
mephistopheles
this
displeases
you
for
shame
you
are
forsooth
entitled
to
exclaim
we
to
chaste
ears
it
seems
must
not
pronounce
what
nathless
the
chaste
heart
can
not
renounce
well
to
be
brief
the
joy
as
fit
occasions
rise
i
grudge
you
not
of
specious
lies
but
long
this
mood
not
retain
already
again
outworn
and
should
this
last
thou
wilt
be
torn
by
frenzy
or
remorse
and
pain
enough
of
this
thy
true
love
dwells
apart
and
all
to
her
seems
flat
and
tame
alone
thine
image
fills
her
heart
she
loves
thee
with
an
flame
first
came
thy
passion
with
rush
like
mountain
torrent
swollen
by
the
melted
snow
pull
in
her
heart
didst
pour
the
sudden
gush
now
has
thy
brookiet
ceased
to
flow
instead
of
sitting
throned
midst
forests
wild
it
would
become
so
great
a
lord
to
comfort
the
enamour
child
and
the
young
monkey
for
her
love
reward
to
her
the
hours
seem
miserably
long
she
from
the
window
sees
the
clouds
float
by
as
the
lofty
they
fly
if
i
a
birdie
were
so
runs
her
song
half
through
the
night
and
all
day
long
cheerful
sometimes
more
oft
at
heart
full
sore
fairly
outwept
seem
now
her
tears
anon
she
tranquil
is
or
so
appears
and
evermore
faust
snake
serpent
vile
mephistopheles
aside
good
if
i
catch
thee
with
my
guile
faust
vile
reprobate
go
get
thee
hence
forbear
the
lovely
girl
to
name
nor
in
my
sense
kindle
anew
the
smouldering
flame
mephistopheles
what
wouldest
thou
she
thinks
you
taken
flight
it
seems
she
partly
in
the
right
faust
i
near
her
still
and
should
i
distant
rove
her
i
can
forget
lose
her
love
and
all
things
touch
by
those
sweet
lips
of
hers
even
the
very
host
my
envy
stirs
mephistopheles
well
i
oft
have
envied
you
indeed
the
that
among
the
roses
feed
faust

avaunt
mephistopheles
go
to
i
laugh
the
while
you
rail
the
power
which
fashion
youth
and
maid
well
understood
the
noble
trade
so
neither
shall
occasion
fail
but
hence
a
mighty
grief
i
trow
unto
thy
lov
one
chamber
thou
and
not
to
death
shouldst
go
faust
what
is
to
me
heaven
joy
within
her

my
life
her
bosom
warms

i
not

her
woe
the
outcast

i
not

unblest
inhuman
monster
without
aim
or

like
the
greedy
surge
from
rock
to
rock
sweeps
down
the
dread
abyss
with
desperate
shock
while
she
within
her
lowly
cot
which
graced
the
alpine
slope
beside
the
waters
wild
her
homely
cares
in
that
small
world
embraced
secluded
lived
a
simple
artless
child
not
enough
in
thy
delirious
whirl
to
blast
the
stedfast
rocks
her
and
her
peace
as
well

holocaust
remorseless

me
to
cut
short
the
hours
of
dread
let
what
must
happen
happen
speedily
her
direful
doom
fall
crushing
on
my
head
and
into
ruin
let
her
plunge
with
me
mephistopheles
why
how
again
it
seethes
and
glows
away
thou

when
such
a
head
no

sees
it

straight
the
final
close
long
life
to
him
who
boldly
dares
a
devil
pluck
wont
to
show
as
for
a
devil
who
despairs
nothing
i
find
so
mawkish
here
below
margaret
room
margaret
alone
at
her
spinning
wheel
my
peace
is
gone
my
heart
is
sore
i

distraught
my

his

of
his

his

words
their
tones

margaret
all
this
is
doubtless
good
and
fair
almost
the
same
the
parson
says
only
in
slightly
different
phrase
faust
beneath
heaven
sunshine
everywhere
this
is
the
utterance
of
the
human
heart
each
in
his
language
doth
the
like
impart
then
why
not
i
in
mine
margaret
what
thus
i
hear
sounds
plausible
yet
i
not
reconciled
there
something
wrong
about
it
much
i
fear
that
thou
art
not
a
christian
faust
my
sweet
child
margaret
alas
it
long
bath
sorely
troubled
me
to
see
thee
in
such
odious
company
faust
how
so
margaret
the
man
who
comes
with
thee
i
hate
yea
in
my
spirit
inmost
depths
abhor
as
his
loath
visage
in
my
life
before
naught
to
my
heart
gave
a
pang
so
great
faust
him
fear
not
my
sweet

chills
my
blood
towards
all
beside
i
have
a
kindly
mood
yet
though
i
yearn
to
gaze
on
thee
i
feel
at
sight
of
him
strange
horror
me
steal
that
he
a
villain
my
conviction
strong
may
heaven
forgive
me
if
i
do
him
wrong
faust
yet
such
strange
fellows
in
the
world
must
be
margaret
i
would
not
live
with
such
an
one
as
he
if
for
a
moment
he
but
enter
here
he
looks
around
him
with
a
mocking
sneer
and
malice
that
he
with
naught
on
earth
can
sympathize
is
clear
upon
his
brow
is
legibly
revealed
that
to
his
heart
no
living
soul
is
dear
so
blest
i
feel
within
thine
arms
so
warm
and
happy
free
from
all
alarms
and
still
my
heart
doth
close
when
he
comes
near
faust
foreboding
angel
check
thy
fear
margaret
it
so
me
that
when
or
his
step
i
hear
i
almost
think
no
more
i
love
thee
then
besides
when
he
is
near
i
could
pray
this
eats
into
my
heart
with
thee
the
same
my
henry
it
must
be
faust
this
is
antipathy
margaret
i
must
away
faust
for
one
brief
hour
then
may
i
never
rest
and
heart
to
heart
and
soul
to
soul
be
pressed

ah
if

alone
the

upon

a

seated
the
jovial

where
merry
comrades
boasting
loud
each
named
with
pride
his
favourite
lass
and
in
her
honour
drain
his
glass
upon
my
elbows
i
would
lean
with
easy
quiet
view
the
scene
nor
give
my
tongue
the
rein
until
each
swaggering
blade
had
talked
his
fill
then
smiling
i
my
beard
would
stroke
the
while
with
brimming
glass
i
spoke
each
to
his
taste
but
to
my
mind
where
in
the
country
will
you
find
a
maid
as
my
dear
gretchen
fair
who
with
my
sister
can
compare
cling

the
jovial

were
the
noisy
boasters
dumb

i
i
could
tear

despair

every
scurvy
knave
may
twit
with
stinging
jest
and
taunting
sneer
like
skulking

i
must
sit
and
sweat
each
casual
word
to
hear
and
though
i
smash
them
one
and
all
yet
them
i
could
not
liars
call
who
comes
this
way
who
sneaking
here

how
from
yon
sacristy
athwart
the
night
its
beams
the
taper
throws
while
ever
waning
fades
the
glimmering
light
as
gathering
darkness
doth
around
it
close
so
gloom
doth
in
my
bosom
reign
mephistopheles
i
like
a
in
a
thievish
vein
that
up
tall
and
steep
and
round
the
walls
doth
slyly
creep
virtuous
withal
i
feel
with
i
confess
a
touch
of
thievish
joy
and
wantonness
thus
through
my
limbs
already
burns
the
glorious
walpurgis
night
after
it
returns
then
why
one
wakes
one
knows
aright
faust
meanwhile
the
treasure
i
see
glimmering
there
will
it
ascend
into

my

inspire
that
such
too
in

grow
mephistopheles
with
the

once
a
weird
vision
came
to
me
therein
i
saw
a
rifted
tree
i
had
a
ready
here
but
as
it
was
it
pleased
me
too
the
old
one
i
beg
most
humbly
to
salute
the
gallant
with
the
cloven
foot
let
him
a
have
ready
here
if
he
a
does
not
fear
proctophantasmist
accursed
mob
how
dare
ye
thus
to
meet
have
i
not
shown
and
demonstrated
too
that
ghosts
stand
not
on

yet
here
ye
dance
as
other

do
the

one
dancing
then
at

ball
what
doth
he
here
faust
dancing
oh
he
must
everywhere
appear
he
must
adjudge
when
others
dance
if
on
each
step
his
say
not
said
so
is
that
step
as
good
as
never
made
he
most
annoyed
so
soon
as
we
advance
if
ye
would
circle
in
one
narrow
round
as
he
in
his
old
mill
then
doubtless
he
your
dancing
would
approve
especially
if
ye
forthwith
salute
him
with

profound
proctophantasmist
still
here
what
arrogance
unheard
of
quite
vanish
we
now
have
fill
the

with

the

here
to

us
any
more
i
pray
proctophantasmist
spirits
i
plainly
to
your
face
declare
no
spiritual
control
myself
will
bear
since
my
own
spirit
can
exert
no
sway
the
dancing
continues
i
see
i
shall
in
naught
succeed
but
i
prepar
my
travels
to
pursue
and
hope
before
my
final

indeed
to
triumph
over
bards

mephistopheles

to
you
in

in

what
faust
mephisto
seest
thou
there
standing
far
off
a

pale
and
fair
slow
from

her
drooping
form
she
tears
and
seems
with
shackled

to
move
along
i

within
me
the
delusion
strong
that
she
the
likeness
of
my
gretchen
wears
mephistopheles

not
upon
her
is
not
good
forbear
is
lifeless
magical
a

of

an

such
to

no

of
hers
doth
freeze
man

petrifies
his

to

are

there

is
magic
i
declare
to
each
she
doth
his
one
image
wear
faust
what
bliss
what
torture
vainly
i
essay
to
turn
me
from
that
piteous
look
away
how
strangely
doth
a
single
crimson
line
around
that
lovely
neck
its
coil
entwine
it
shows
no
broader
than
a

blunt
edge
mephistopheles
quite
right
i
see
it
also
and
allege
that
she
beneath
her

her

can
bear

cut
it

craving
for
