translated

windus
preface
is
the
second
book
of
the
new
series
which
zola
began
with
and
which
he
hopes
to
complete
with
and
i
should
much
have
liked
to
discuss
here
in
some
detail
several
of
the
matters
which
zola
brings
forward
in
this
instalment
of
his
literary
testament
but
unfortunately
the
latter
part
of
the
present
translation
has
been
made
by
me
in
the
midst
of
great
bodily
suffering
and
i
have
not
now
the
strength
to
do
as
i
desired
i
will
only
say
therefore
that
embraces
many
features
it
is
first
an
exposition
of
zola
gospel
of
work
as
the
duty
of
every
man
born
into
the
world
and
the
sovereign
cure
for
many
ills
a
gospel
which
he
has
set
forth
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
his
numerous
writings
and
which
will
be
found
synthetised
so
to
say
in
a
paper
called
and
labour
translated
by
me
for
the
review
some
years
ago
secondly
deals
with
the
conditions
of
society
so
far
as
those
conditions
are
affected
by
capital
and
labour
and
thirdly
and
particularly
it
embraces
a
scheme
of
social
reorganisation
and
regeneration
in
which
the
ideas
of
charles
fourier
the
eminent
philosopher
are
taken
as
a
basis
and
broadened
and
adapted
to
the
needs
of
a
new
century
some
may
regard
this
scheme
as
being
merely
the
splendid
dream
of
a
poet
the
book
certainly
abounds
in
symbolism
but
all
must
admit
that
it
is
a
scheme
of
evolution
and
therefore
one
to
be
preferred
to
the
violent
remedies
proposed
by
most
socialist
schools
in
this
respect
the
book
has
a
peculiar
significance
though
the
english
press
pays
very
little
attention
to
the
matter
things
are
moving
apace
in
france
the
quiet
of
that
country
is
only
the
socialist
schools
are
each
day
making
more
and
more
progress
the
very
peasants
are
fast
becoming
socialists
and
as
i
wrote
comparatively
recently
in
my
preface
to
the
new
english
version
of
zola
the
most
serious
troubles
may
almost
at
any
moment
convulse
the
republic
thus
it
is
well
that
zola
who
has
always
been
a
fervent
partisan
of
peace
and
human
brotherliness
should
be
found
at
such
a
juncture
pointing
out
pacific
courses
to
those
who
believe
that
a
bath
of
blood
must
necessarily
precede
all
social
regeneration
incidentally
in
the
course
of
his
statements
and
arguments
zola
brings
forward
some
very
interesting
points
i
would
particularly
refer
the
reader
to
what
he
writes
on
the
subject
of
education
again
his
sketch
of
the
unhappy
french
peasant
of
nowadays
may
be
scanned
with
advantage
by
those
who
foolishly
believe
that
peasant
to
be
one
of
the
most
contented
beings
in
the
world
the
contrary
is
unhappily
the
case
the
subdivision
of
the
soil
having
reached
such
a
point
that
the
land
can
not
be
properly
or
profitably
cultivated
after
lasting
a
hundred
years
the
order
of
things
established
in
the
french
provinces
by
the
great
revolution
has
utterly
broken
down
the
economic
conditions
of
the
world
have
changed
and
the
only
hope
for
french
agriculture
rests
in
farming
on
a
huge
scale
this
the
peasant
amidst
his
hard
struggle
with
pauperism
is
now
realising
and
this
it
is
which
is
fast
making
him
a
socialist
all
that
zola
writes
in
on
the
subject
of
iron
and
steel
factories
and
the
progressive
changes
in
processes
and
so
forth
will
doubtless
be
read
with
interest
at
the
present
time
when
so
much
is
being
said
and
written
about
a
certain
large
american
the
reliance
which
he
places
in
science
the
great
pacific
revolutionary
to
effect
the
most
advantageous
changes
in
conditions
of
labour
is
assuredly
justified
by
facts
personally
i
rely
far
more
on
science
than
on
any
innate
spirit
of
brotherliness
between
men
to
bring
about
comparative
happiness
for
the
human
race
in
conclusion
i
may
point
out
that
the
tendency
of
zola
book
in
one
respect
is
shown
by
the
title
chosen
for
the
present
translation
the
original
is
called
which
might
have
been
rendered
in
english
as
either
or
we
read
every
day
about
the
world
the
of
labour
the
party
and
so
forth
and
as
these
matters
are
largely
dealt
with
by
zola
some
may
think
that
would
have
been
the
better
title
for
the
english
version
of
his
book
but
then
it
is
zola
desire
that
man
should
no
more
he
does
not
wish
him
to
groan
beneath
excessive
toil
he
simply
desires
that
he
should
in
health
and
in
gaiety
with
the
help
of
science
to
lighten
his
task
and
a
just
apportionment
of
wealth
and
happiness
to
gild
his
days
until
he
takes
his
rest

i
as
luc
froment
walked
on
at
random
after
emerging
from
beauclair
he
went
up
the
brias
road
following
the
gorge
in
which
the
mionne
torrent
flows
between
the
two
promontories
of
the
bleuse
mountains
and
when
he
found
himself
before
the
abyss
as
the
qurignon
are
called
in
the
region
he
perceived
two
dark
and
puny
creatures
shrinking
timidly
against
the
parapet
at
the
corner
of
the
wooden
bridge
his
heart
contracted
one
was
a
woman
looking
very
young
poorly
clad
her
head
half
hidden
by
some
ragged
woollen
stuff
and
the
other
nestling
amidst
her
skirts
was
a
child
about
six
years
old
and
scarcely
clothed
at
all
both
had
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
of
the
works
and
were
waiting
motionless
with
the
mournful
patience
of
despairing
beings
luc
paused
and
also
looked
it
would
soon
be
six
and
the
light
of
that
wretched
muggy
evening
was
already
waning
it
was
a
saturday
and
since
thursday
the
rain
had
scarcely
ceased
to
fall
it
was
no
longer
coming
down
at
present
but
across
the
sky
an
impetuous
wind
was
still
driving
a
number
of
clouds
sooty
ragged
clouds
athwart
which
filtered
a
dirty
yellowish
twilight
full
of
mortal
sadness
along
the
road
over
which
stretched
lines
of
rails
and
where
big
were
disjointed
by
continuous
traffic
there
flowed
a
river
of
black
mud
all
the
gathered
moistened
dust
of
the
neighbouring
of
brias
whose
tumbrels
were
for
ever
going
by
and
that
had
cast
a
blackness
as
of
mourning
over
the
entire
gorge
it
fell
in
patches
over
the
leprous
pile
of
factory
buildings
and
seemed
even
to
besmirch
those
dark
clouds
which
passed
on
interminably
like
smoke
an
ominous
melancholy
swept
by
with
the
wind
one
might
have
thought
that
the
murky
quivering
twilight
was
bringing
the
end
of
the
world
in
its
train
luc
had
stopped
short
at
a
few
paces
from
the
young
woman
and
the
boy
and
he
heard
the
latter
saying
with
a
shrewd
decisive
air
like
one
who
was
already
a
little
man
say
would
you
like
me
to
speak
to
him
he
would
get
so
angry
with
me
but
the
young
woman
replied
no
those
are
not
matters
for
little
boys
then
again
they
continued
waiting
in
silence
with
an
air
of
anxious
resignation
luc
was
now
looking
at
the
abyss
from
professional
curiosity
he
had
visited
it
when
first
passing
through
beauclair
the
previous
spring
and
during
the
few
hours
that
he
had
again
found
himself
in
the
district
suddenly
summoned
thither
by
his
friend
jordan
he
had
heard
through
what
a
frightful
crisis
the
region
had
just
passed
there
had
been
a
terrible
strike
of
two
months
duration
and
ruin
was
piled
up
on
either
side
the
establishment
had
greatly
suffered
from
the
stoppage
of
work
and
the
workmen
their
rage
increased
by
their
powerlessness
had
almost
starved
it
was
only
two
days
previously
on
the
thursday
that
work
had
been
resumed
after
reciprocal
concessions
wrung
from
either
party
with
the
greatest
difficulty
after
the
most
furious
wrangling
and
the
men
had
gone
back
like
joyless
vanquished
beings
enraged
by
defeat
retaining
in
their
hearts
only
a
recollection
of
their
sufferings
and
a
keen
desire
for
revenge
under
the
wild
flight
of
the
mourning
clouds
the
abyss
spread
its
sombre
piles
of
buildings
and
sheds
it
was
like
a
monster
which
had
sprung
up
there
extending
by
degrees
the
roofs
of
its
little
town
one
could
guess
the
ages
of
the
various
structures
by
the
colour
of
those
roofs
which
arose
and
spread
out
in
every
direction
the
establishment
now
occupied
a
surface
of
many
acres
and
employed
a
thousand
hands
the
lofty
bluish
slated
roofs
of
the
great
halls
with
coupled
windows
overtopped
the
old
blackened
tiles
of
the
earlier
buildings
which
were
far
more
humble
up
above
one
perceived
from
the
road
the
gigantic
hives
of
the
ranged
in
a
row
as
well
as
the
tempering
tower
feet
high
where
big
cannon
were
plunged
on
end
into
baths
of
petroleum
and
higher
still
ascended
smoking
chimneys
chimneys
of
all
sizes
a
very
forest
whose
sooty
breath
mingled
with
the
flying
soot
of
the
clouds
whilst
at
regular
intervals
narrow
with
strident
respiration
threw
out
white
plumes
of
steam
all
this
seemed
like
the
breathing
of
the
monster
the
dust
the
vapour
that
it
incessantly
exhaled
enveloped
it
as
in
an
everlasting
cloud
of
the
perspiration
of
toil
and
there
was
also
the
beating
of
its
organs
the
impact
the
noise
of
its
every
effort
the
vibration
of
machinery
the
clear
cadence
of
the
great
rhythmical
blows
of
resounding
like
huge
bells
and
making
the
soil
shake
and
at
the
edge
of
the
road
in
the
depths
of
a
little
building
where
the
first
qurignon
had
first
forged
iron
one
could
hear
the
violent
desperate
dance
of
two
which
were
beating
there
like
the
very
pulse
of
the
colossus
every
one
of
whose
furnaces
flamed
afresh
in
the
ruddy
and
dismal
crepuscular
mist
which
was
gradually
submerging
the
abyss
not
a
single
electric
lamp
as
yet
lighted
up
the
yards
nor
was
there
any
light
gleaming
through
the
dusty
windows
alone
through
the
gaping
doorway
of
one
of
the
large
halls
there
burst
a
vivid
flame
which
transpierced
the
gloom
with
a
long
jet
of
light
like
that
of
some
fusing
star
a
master
puddler
had
doubtless
opened
the
door
of
his
furnace
and
nothing
else
not
even
a
stray
spark
proclaimed
the
presence
of
the
empire
of
fire
the
fire
roaring
within
that
darkened
city
of
toil
the
internal
fire
which
heated
the
whole
of
it
the
trained
subjected
fire
which
bent
and
fashioned
iron
like
soft
wax
and
which
had
given
man
royalty
over
the
earth
ever
since
the
first
vulcans
had
conquered
it
at
last
the
clock
in
the
little
belfry
surmounting
the
offices
struck
six
and
luc
then
again
heard
the
poor
child
saying
they
will
be
coming
out
now
yes
i
know
well
enough
the
young
woman
answered
you
keep
quiet
as
she
moved
forward
to
restrain
the
child
her
ragged
wrapper
fell
back
slightly
from
before
her
face
and
luc
remarked
the
delicacy
of
her
features
with
surprise
she
was
surely
less
than
twenty
she
had
fair
hair
all
in
disorder
a
poor
thin
little
face
which
to
him
seemed
ugly
blue
eyes
blurred
by
tears
and
a
pale
mouth
that
twitched
bitterly
with
suffering
and
what
a
light
girlish
frame
there
was
within
her
old
threadbare
dress
and
with
what
a
weak
and
trembling
arm
did
she
press
to
her
skirts
the
child
her
little
brother
who
was
fair
like
herself
and
equally
but
and
more
resolute
luc
felt
his
compassion
increasing
whilst
the
two
poor
creatures
on
their
side
grew
distrustfully
anxious
about
that
gentleman
who
had
stopped
so
near
and
was
examining
them
so
persistently
she
in
particular
seemed
embarrassed
by
the
scrutiny
of
that
young
fellow
of
so
tall
and
handsome
with
shoulders
broad
hands
and
a
face
all
health
and
joy
whose
features
were
by
a
straight
and
towering
brow
the
towering
brow
of
the
froment
family
she
had
averted
her
gaze
as
it
met
the
young
brown
eyes
which
looked
her
frankly
in
the
face
then
she
once
more
stole
a
furtive
glance
and
seeing
that
he
was
smiling
at
her
in
a
kindly
way
she
drew
back
a
little
more
in
the
disquietude
born
of
her
great
distress
the
clang
of
a
bell
was
heard
there
was
a
stir
in
the
abyss
and
then
began
the
departure
of
the
which
the
were
about
to
replace
for
never
is
there
a
pause
in
the
monster
devouring
life
it
flames
and
forges
both
by
day
and
night
nevertheless
there
was
some
delay
in
the
departure
of
the
although
work
had
only
been
resumed
on
the
thursday
most
of
them
had
applied
for
an
advance
for
after
that
terrible
strike
of
two
months
duration
great
was
the
hunger
in
every
home
at
last
they
began
to
appear
coming
along
one
by
one
or
in
little
parties
all
gloomy
and
in
a
hurry
with
their
heads
bent
whilst
in
the
depths
of
their
pockets
they
stowed
away
their
few
dearly
earned
silver
coins
which
would
procure
a
little
bread
for
wife
and
children
and
in
turn
they
disappeared
along
the
black
highway
he
is
the
little
boy
muttered
you
see
him
he
with
bourron
yes
keep
quiet
two
men
two
puddlers
had
just
left
the
works
the
first
who
was
accompanied
by
bourron
had
a
cloth
jacket
thrown
over
his
shoulders
he
was
barely
his
hair
and
beard
were
ruddy
and
he
was
rather
short
though
his
muscles
were
strong
under
a
prominent
brow
he
showed
a
hook
nose
massive
jaws
and
projecting
yet
he
could
laugh
in
a
very
agreeable
way
which
largely
accounted
for
his
success
with
women
bourron
five
years
the
elder
and
closely
buttoned
in
an
old
jacket
of
greenish
velveteen
was
a
tall
dry
scraggy
fellow
whose
equine
face
with
long
cheeks
short
chin
and
eyes
set
almost
sideways
expressed
the
quiet
nature
of
a
man
who
takes
life
easily
and
is
always
under
the
influence
of
one
or
another
mate
bourron
had
caught
sight
of
the
mournful
woman
and
child
standing
across
the
road
at
the
corner
of
the
wooden
bridge
and
nudging
his
companion
with
his
elbow
he
exclaimed
say
ragu
josine
and
nanet
are
yonder
be
careful
if
you
do
want
them
to
pester
you
ragu
ragefully
clenched
his
fists
girl
i
had
enough
of
her
i
turned
her
out
just
let
her
try
to
come
dangling
after
me
again
and
you
see
he
seemed
to
be
slightly
intoxicated
as
always
happened
indeed
on
those
days
when
he
exceeded
the
three
quarts
of
wine
which
he
declared
he
needed
to
prevent
the
heat
of
the
furnace
from
drying
up
his
skin
and
in
his
he
yielded
the
more
especially
to
a
cruel
boastful
impulse
to
show
his
mate
how
he
treated
girls
when
he
no
longer
cared
for
them
shall
send
her
packing
said
he
had
enough
of
her
with
nanet
still
among
her
skirts
josine
was
now
gently
timidly
stepping
forward
but
she
paused
on
seeing
two
other
workmen
approach

and
bourron
they
belonged
to
a

had
just
arrived
from
beauclair
fauchard
the
eldest
a
man
of
thirty
looking
quite
ten
years
older
was
a
drawer
and
seemed
already
for
by
his
terrible
work
his
face
had
the
appearance
of
boiled
flesh
his
eyes
were
scorched
the
whole
of
his
big
frame
burnt
and
warped
by
the
ardent
glow
of
the
furnaces
when
he
drew
out
the
fusing
metal
the
other
his
fortunÃ©
was
a
lad
of
sixteen
though
he
would
hardly
have
been
thought
twelve
so
puny
was
his
frame
he
had
a
thin
face
and
discoloured
hair
and
looked
as
if
he
had
ceased
growing
as
if
indeed
he
were
eaten
into
by
the
mechanical
toil
which
he
ever
performed
perched
beside
the
lever
of
a
amidst
all
the
bewilderment
born
of
blinding
steam
and
deafening
noise
on
his
arm
fauchard
carried
an
old
black
osier
basket
and
he
had
stopped
to
ask
the
others
in
a
husky
voice
you
go
he
wished
to
ascertain
if
they
had
gone
to
the
cashier
office
and
obtained
an
advance
there
and
when
ragu
without
a
word
slapped
his
pocket
in
which
some
pieces
jingled
the
other
made
a
despairing
gesture
and
exclaimed
to
think
that
i
got
to
tighten
my
belt
until
morning
and
that
i
shall
be
dying
of
thirst
all
night
unless
my
wife
by
some
miracle
or
other
contrives
to
bring
me
my
ration
his
ration
was
four
quarts
of
wine
for
each
day
or
and
he
was
wont
to
say
that
this
quantity
only
just
sufficed
to
moisten
his
body
to
such
a
degree
did
the
furnaces
drain
all
the
blood
and
water
from
his
flesh
he
cast
a
mournful
glance
at
his
basket
in
which
nothing
save
a
hunk
of
bread
was
jolting
the
failure
to
secure
his
usual
four
quarts
of
wine
meant
the
end
of
everything
black
agony
amidst
overpowering
unbearable
toil
said
bourron
complacently
wife
wo
leave
you
in
the
lurch
she
has
her
equal
for
getting
credit
somewhere
then
all
at
once
the
four
men
standing
in
the
sticky
mud
became
silent
and
touched
their
caps
luc
had
seen
a
kind
of
approaching
propelled
by
a
servant
and
ensconced
within
it
sat
an
old
gentleman
with
a
broad
face
and
regular
features
around
which
fell
an
abundance
of
long
white
hair
in
this
old
gentleman
the
young
fellow
recognised
jÃ©rÃ´me
qurignon
jÃ©rÃ´me
as
he
was
called
throughout
the
region
the
son
of
blaise
qurignon
the
drawer
by
whom
the
abyss
had
been
founded
very
aged
and
paralysed
never
speaking
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
caused
himself
to
be
carted
about
in
this
fashion
no
matter
what
might
be
the
weather
that
evening
as
he
passed
the
works
on
his
way
back
to
his
residence
la
guerdache
a
neighbouring
estate
he
had
signed
to
his
servant
to
go
more
slowly
and
with
his
still
bright
living
eyes
he
had
then
taken
a
long
look
at
the
monster
at
the
day
hands
departing
homeward
and
at
the
night
hands
arriving
whilst
the
vague
twilight
fell
from
the
livid
sky
besmirched
by
rushing
clouds
and
his
glance
had
afterwards
rested
on
the
manager
house
a
square
building
standing
in
a
garden
which
his
father
had
erected
forty
years
previously
and
where
he
himself
had
long
reigned
like
a
conquering
king
gaining
million
after
million
jÃ©rÃ´me
is
bothered
as
to
how
he
will
get
any
wine
resumed
bourron
in
a
sneering
whisper
ragu
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
father
said
he
comrades
yes
they
were
both
workmen
and
drew
iron
here
together
the
fortune
might
have
come
to
a
ragu
just
as
well
as
to
a
qurignon
it
all
luck
you
know
when
it
robbery
quiet
bourron
muttered
be
getting
into
trouble
ragu
bounce
deserted
him
and
when
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
passing
the
group
looked
at
the
four
men
with
his
large
fixed
limpid
eyes
he
again
touched
his
cap
with
all
the
timorous
respect
of
a
toiler
who
is
ready
enough
to
cry
out
against
employers
behind
their
backs
but
has
long
years
of
slavery
in
his
blood
and
trembles
in
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
god
from
whom
he
awaits
the
bread
of
life
the
servant
meanwhile
slowly
pushed
the
onward
and
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
disappeared
at
last
down
the
black
road
descending
towards
beauclair
said
fauchard
philosophically
by
way
of
conclusion
not
so
happy
after
all
in
that
wheelbarrow
of
his
and
besides
if
he
can
still
understand
things
that
strike
ca
have
been
very
pleasant
to
him
we
each
have
our
troubles
but
thunder
i
only
hope
that
natalie
will
bring
me
my
wine
then
he
went
off
into
the
works
taking
with
him
little
fortunÃ©
who
had
not
spoken
a
word
and
looked
as
bewildered
as
ever
already
feeling
weary
they
disappeared
amidst
the
increasing
darkness
which
was
enveloping
the
buildings
whilst
ragu
and
bourron
set
out
again
the
former
bent
on
leading
the
latter
astray
to
some
tavern
in
the
town
but
then
dash
it
all
a
man
surely
had
a
right
to
drink
a
glass
and
laugh
a
bit
after
undergoing
so
much
misery
however
luc
who
from
compassionate
curiosity
had
remained
leaning
against
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
saw
josine
again
advance
with
short
unsteady
steps
to
bar
the
way
to
ragu
for
a
moment
she
had
hoped
that
he
would
cross
the
bridge
homeward
bound
for
that
was
the
direct
road
to
old
beauclair
a
sordid
mass
of
hovels
in
which
most
of
the
workpeople
of
the
abyss
lived
but
when
she
understood
that
he
was
going
down
to
the
new
town
she
foresaw
what
would
happen
the
money
he
had
obtained
would
be
spent
in
some
and
she
and
her
little
brother
would
have
to
spend
another
whole
evening
waiting
dying
of
starvation
amidst
the
bitter
wind
in
the
streets
and
her
sufferings
and
a
fit
of
sudden
anger
lent
her
so
much
courage
that
puny
and
woeful
though
she
was
she
went
and
took
her
stand
before
the
man
reasonable
auguste
said
she
ca
leave
me
he
did
not
answer
but
stepped
on
in
order
to
pass
her
you
are
not
going
home
at
once
give
me
the
key
at
any
rate
she
continued
been
in
the
street
ever
since
this
morning
without
even
a
morsel
of
bread
to
eat
at
this
he
burst
forth
let
me
be
have
you
done
sticking
to
me
like
a
leech
did
you
carry
off
the
key
this
morning
she
answered
only
ask
you
to
give
me
the
key
you
can
come
in
when
you
like
it
is
almost
night
now
and
you
surely
do
want
us
to
sleep
on
the
pavement
key
the
key
i
have
got
it
and
even
if
i
had
i
would
give
it
you
just
understand
once
for
all
that
i
had
enough
of
it
that
i
do
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
that
it
quite
enough
that
we
starved
together
for
two
months
and
that
now
you
can
go
somewhere
else
and
see
if
i
there
he
shouted
those
words
in
her
face
violently
and
savagely
and
she
poor
little
creature
quivered
beneath
his
insults
whilst
gently
persevering
in
her
efforts
with
all
the
woeful
desperation
of
a
wretch
who
feels
the
very
ground
giving
way
beneath
her
you
are
cruel
you
are
cruel
she
gasped
have
a
talk
when
you
come
home
i
go
away
if
it
necessary
but
give
me
the
key
just
for
then
the
man
infuriated
pushed
her
thrust
her
aside
with
a
brutal
gesture
it
all
he
cried
the
road
belong
to
me
as
much
as
you
go
and
croak
wherever
you
like
i
tell
you
that
it
all
over
and
as
little
nanet
seeing
his
sister
sob
stepped
forward
with
his
air
of
decision
his
pink
face
and
tangle
of
fair
hair
ragu
added
the
brat
as
well
am
i
to
have
the
whole
family
on
my
shoulders
now
wait
a
minute
you
young
rascal
i
let
you
feel
my
boot
somewhere
josine
quickly
drew
nanet
towards
her
and
they
both
remained
there
standing
in
the
black
mud
shivering
with
woe
whilst
the
two
workmen
went
their
way
disappearing
amidst
the
gloom
in
the
direction
of
beauclair
whose
lights
one
by
one
were
now
beginning
to
shine
bourron
who
at
bottom
was
a
fellow
had
made
a
movement
as
if
to
intervene
then
however
in
a
spirit
of
imitation
yielding
to
the
influence
of
his
rakish
companion
he
had
let
things
take
their
course
and
josine
after
momentarily
hesitating
asking
what
use
it
would
be
to
follow
made
up
her
mind
to
do
so
with
despairing
stubbornness
as
soon
as
the
others
had
disappeared
with
slow
steps
she
descended
the
road
in
their
wake
dragging
her
little
brother
by
the
hand
and
keeping
very
close
to
the
walls
taking
indeed
all
sorts
of
precautions
as
if
she
feared
that
on
seeing
her
they
might
beat
her
to
prevent
her
from
dogging
their
steps
luc
in
his
indignation
had
almost
rushed
on
ragu
to
administer
a
correction
to
him
ah
the
misery
of
labour
man
turned
to
a
wolf
by
overpowering
and
unjust
toil
by
the
difficulty
of
earning
the
bread
for
which
hunger
so
wildly
contends
during
those
two
months
of
the
strike
crumbs
had
been
fought
for
amidst
all
the
voracity
and
exasperation
of
daily
quarrels
then
on
the
very
first
the
man
rushed
to
drink
for
forgetfulness
leaving
his
companion
of
woe
whether
she
were
his
wife
or
a
girl
he
had
seduced
in
the
streets
and
luc
remembered
the
four
years
which
he
had
lately
spent
in
a
faubourg
of
paris
in
one
of
those
huge
buildings
where
the
misery
of
the
working
classes
sobs
and
fights
upon
every
floor
how
many
tragedies
had
he
not
witnessed
how
many
sorrows
had
he
not
attempted
to
assuage
the
frightful
problem
born
of
all
the
shame
and
torture
attending
the
wage
system
had
often
arisen
before
his
mind
he
had
fully
sounded
that
system
atrocious
iniquity
the
horrible
sore
which
is
eating
away
society
and
he
had
spent
hours
of
generous
enthusiasm
in
dreaming
of
a
remedy
ever
encountering
however
the
iron
wall
of
existing
reality
and
now
on
the
very
evening
of
his
return
to
beauclair
he
came
upon
that
savage
scene
that
pale
and
mournful
creature
cast
starving
into
the
streets
through
the
fault
of
the
monster
whose
internal
fire
he
could
ever
hear
growling
whilst
overhead
it
escaped
in
murky
smoke
rolling
away
under
the
tragic
sky
a
gust
of
wind
passed
and
a
few
flew
by
in
the
moaning
wind
luc
had
remained
on
the
bridge
looking
towards
beauclair
and
trying
to
take
his
bearings
by
the
last
gleams
of
light
that
fell
athwart
the
sooty
clouds
on
his
right
was
the
abyss
with
its
buildings
bordering
the
brias
road
beneath
him
rolled
the
mionne
whilst
higher
up
along
an
embankment
on
the
left
passed
the
railway
line
from
brias
to
magnolles
these
filled
the
depths
of
the
gorge
between
the
last
spurs
of
the
bleuse
mountains
at
the
spot
where
they
parted
to
disclose
the
great
plain
of
la
roumagne
and
in
a
kind
of
estuary
at
the
spot
where
the
ravine
debouched
into
the
plain
beauclair
reared
its
houses
a
wretched
collection
of
dwellings
prolonged
over
the
flat
by
a
little
town
in
which
were
the
the
the
and
the
prison
whilst
the
ancient
church
whose
walls
threatened
to
fall
stood
part
in
new
and
part
in
old
beauclair
this
town
the
chief
one
of
an
arrondissement
numbered
barely
six
thousand
souls
five
thousand
of
them
being
poor
humble
souls
in
suffering
bodies
warped
ground
to
death
by
iniquitous
hard
toil
and
luc
took
in
everything
fully
when
above
the
abyss
up
the
promontory
of
the
bleuse
mountains
he
distinguished
the
dark
silhouette
of
the
blast
furnace
of
la
crÃªcherie
labour
labour
ah
who
would
redeem
and
reorganise
it
according
to
the
natural
law
of
truth
and
equity
so
as
to
restore
to
it
its
position
as
the
most
noble
force
of
the
world
and
so
as
to
ensure
a
just
division
of
the
world
riches
thereby
at
last
bringing
the
happiness
which
is
rightly
due
to
every
man
although
the
rain
had
again
ceased
luc
also
ended
by
going
down
towards
beauclair
workmen
were
still
leaving
the
abyss
and
he
walked
among
them
as
they
tramped
on
thinking
of
that
rageful
resumption
of
work
after
all
the
disasters
of
the
strike
such
infinite
sadness
born
of
rebellion
and
powerlessness
pervaded
the
young
man
that
he
would
have
gone
away
that
evening
indeed
that
moment
had
he
not
feared
to
inconvenience
his
friend
jordan
the
latter
the
master
of
la
crÃªcherie
had
been
placed
in
a
position
of
great
embarrassment
by
the
sudden
death
of
the
old
engineer
who
had
managed
his
smeltery
and
he
had
written
to
luc
asking
him
to
come
inquire
into
things
and
give
him
some
good
advice
then
the
young
man
on
hastening
to
beauclair
in
an
affectionate
spirit
had
found
another
letter
awaiting
him
a
letter
in
which
jordan
announced
a
family
catastrophe
the
sudden
tragical
death
of
a
cousin
at
cannes
which
obliged
him
to
leave
at
once
and
remain
absent
with
his
sister
for
three
days
he
begged
luc
to
wait
for
them
until
monday
evening
and
to
instal
himself
meanwhile
in
a
pavilion
which
he
placed
at
his
disposal
and
where
he
might
make
himself
fully
at
home
thus
luc
still
had
another
two
days
to
waste
and
for
lack
of
other
occupation
cast
as
he
was
in
that
little
town
which
he
scarcely
knew
he
had
gone
that
evening
for
a
ramble
telling
the
servant
who
waited
on
him
that
he
should
not
even
return
to
dinner
passionately
interested
as
he
was
in
popular
manners
and
customs
fond
of
observing
and
learning
he
felt
that
he
could
get
something
to
eat
in
any
tavern
of
the
town
new
thoughts
came
upon
him
whilst
under
the
wild
tempestuous
sky
he
walked
on
through
the
black
mud
amidst
the
heavy
tramping
of
the
harassed
silent
workmen
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
previous
sentimental
weakness
why
should
he
go
off
when
here
again
he
once
more
found
so
poignant
and
so
keen
the
problem
by
which
he
was
ever
haunted
he
must
not
flee
the
fight
he
must
gather
facts
together
and
perhaps
amidst
the
dim
confusion
in
which
he
was
still
seeking
a
solution
he
might
at
last
discover
the
safe
sure
path
that
led
to
it
a
son
of
pierre
and
marie
froment
he
had
learnt
like
his
brothers
mathieu
marc
and
jean
a
manual
calling
apart
from
the
special
study
which
he
had
made
of
engineering
he
was
a
a
and
having
a
taste
for
that
avocation
fond
of
working
at
times
in
the
great
paris
he
was
familiar
with
the
tragedies
of
the
and
dreamt
in
a
fraternal
spirit
of
helping
on
the
peaceful
triumph
of
the
of
but
what
could
he
do
in
which
direction
should
he
make
an
effort
by
what
reform
should
he
begin
how
was
he
to
bring
forth
the
solution
which
he
felt
to
be
vaguely
palpitating
within
him
taller
and
stronger
than
his
brother
mathieu
with
the
open
face
of
a
man
of
action
a
towering
brow
a
lofty
mind
ever
in
travail
he
had
hitherto
embraced
but
the
void
with
those
big
arms
of
his
which
were
so
impatient
to
create
and
build
but
again
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
sped
by
a
hurricane
blast
which
made
him
quiver
as
with
awe
was
it
in
some
capacity
that
an
unknown
force
had
cast
him
into
that
woeful
region
to
fulfil
the
mission
of
deliverance
and
happiness
when
luc
raising
his
head
freed
himself
of
those
vague
reflections
he
perceived
that
he
had
come
back
to
beauclair
again
four
large
streets
meeting
at
a
central
square
the
place
de
la
mairie
divide
the
town
into
four
more
or
less
equal
portions
and
each
of
these
streets
bears
the
name
of
some
neighbouring

towards
which
it
leads

on
the
south
the
rue

the
most
popular
the
most
bustling
of
all
with
its
many
shops
stocked
to
overflowing
is
the
rue
de
brias
in
which
luc
at
present
found
himself
for
in
that
direction
lie
all
the
factories
from
which
a
dark
stream
of
toilers
pours
whenever
time
comes
round
just
as
luc
arrived
the
great
door
of
the
gourier
belonging
to
the
mayor
of
beauclair
opened
and
away
rushed
its
five
hundred
hands
amongst
whom
were
numbered
more
than
two
hundred
women
and
children
then
in
some
of
the
neighbouring
streets
were
chodorge
works
where
only
nails
were
made
hausser
works
which
turned
out
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
scythes
and
sickles
every
year
and
mirande
works
which
more
particularly
supplied
agricultural
machinery
they
had
all
suffered
from
the
strike
at
the
abyss
where
they
supplied
themselves
with
raw
material
iron
and
steel
distress
and
hunger
had
passed
over
every
one
of
them
the
wan
thin
workers
who
poured
from
them
on
to
the
muddy
had
rancour
in
their
eyes
and
mute
revolt
upon
their
lips
although
they
showed
the
seeming
resignation
of
a
hurrying
tramping
flock
under
the
few
lamps
whose
yellow
flames
flickered
in
the
wind
the
street
was
black
with
toilers
homeward
bound
and
the
block
in
the
circulation
was
increased
by
a
number
of
housewives
who
having
at
last
secured
a
few
coppers
to
spend
were
hastening
to
one
or
another
shop
to
treat
themselves
to
a
big
loaf
or
a
little
meat
it
seemed
to
luc
as
if
he
were
in
some
town
the
siege
of
which
had
been
raised
that
very
evening
hither
and
thither
among
the
crowd
walked
gendarmes
quite
a
number
of
armed
men
who
kept
a
close
watch
on
the
inhabitants
as
if
from
fear
of
a
resumption
of
hostilities
some
sudden
fury
arising
from
galling
sufferings
whence
might
come
the
sack
of
the
town
in
a
supreme
impulse
of
destructive
exasperation
no
doubt
the
masters
the
authorities
had
overcome
the
but
the
overpowered
slaves
still
remained
so
threatening
in
their
passive
silence
that
the
atmosphere
reeked
of
bitterness
and
one
felt
a
dread
of
vengeance
of
the
possibility
of
some
great
massacre
sweeping
by
a
vague
growl
came
from
that
beaten
powerless
flock
filing
along
the
street
and
the
glitter
of
a
weapon
the
silver
braid
of
a
uniform
shining
here
and
there
among
the
groups
testified
to
the
unacknowledged
fear
of
the
employers
who
despite
their
victory
were
bursting
into
perspiration
behind
the
thick
carefully
drawn
curtains
of
their
pleasure
houses
whilst
the
black
crowd
of
starveling
toilers
still
and
ever
went
by
with
lowered
heads
hustling
one
another
in
silence
whilst
continuing
his
ramble
luc
mingled
with
the
groups
paused
listened
and
studied
things
in
this
wise
he
halted
before
a
large
butcher
shop
open
on
the
street
where
several
were
flaring
amidst
ruddy
meat
dacheux
the
master
butcher
a
fat
apoplectical
man
with
big
goggle
eyes
set
in
a
short
red
face
stood
on
the
threshold
keeping
watch
over
his
viands
evincing
the
while
much
politeness
towards
the
servants
of
customers
and
becoming
extremely
suspicious
directly
any
poor
housewife
came
in
for
the
last
few
minutes
he
had
kept
his
eyes
upon
a
tall
slim
blonde
pale
sickly
and
wretched
whose
youthful
good
looks
had
already
faded
and
who
whilst
dragging
with
her
a
fine
child
between
four
and
five
years
old
carried
upon
one
arm
a
heavy
basket
whence
protruded
the
necks
of
four
of
wine
in
this
woman
dacheux
had
recognised
la
fauchard
whose
constant
appeals
for
little
credits
he
was
tired
of
discouraging
and
as
she
made
up
her
mind
to
go
in
he
all
but
barred
the
way
do
you
want
again
you
he
asked
dacheux
stammered
natalie
you
would
only
be
so
kind
my
husband
has
gone
back
to
the
works
you
know
and
will
receive
something
on
account
and
so
monsieur
caffiaux
was
good
enough
to
advance
me
the
four
quarts
i
have
here
and
would
you
be
so
kind
monsieur
dacheux
as
to
advance
me
a
little
meat
just
a
little
bit
of
meat
at
this
the
butcher
became
furious
his
blood
rushed
to
his
face
and
he
bellowed
i
told
you
no
before
that
strike
of
yours
nearly
ruined
me
how
can
you
think
me
fool
enough
to
be
on
your
side
there
will
always
be
enough
lazy
workmen
to
prevent
honest
folk
from
doing
business
when
people
do
work
enough
to
eat
meat
they
go
without
it
he
busied
himself
with
politics
and
like
a
man
one
who
was
greatly
feared
he
was
on
the
side
of
the
rich
and
powerful
on
his
lips
the
word
assumed
aristocratic
importance
meat
was
sacred
it
was
a
luxury
reserved
to
the
happy
ones
of
the
earth
when
it
ought
to
have
belonged
to
all
owe
me
four
francs
from
last
summer
he
resumed
have
to
pay
people
i
have
at
this
natalie
almost
collapsed
then
she
again
strove
to
touch
him
pleading
in
a
low
prayerful
voice
but
an
incident
which
occurred
just
then
completed
her
discomfiture
madame
dacheux
an
ugly
dark
little
woman
who
none
the
less
contrived
to
make
her
husband
the
talk
of
the
town
stepped
forward
with
her
little
daughter
julienne
a
child
of
four
plump
healthy
fair
and
full
of
gaiety
and
the
two
children
having
caught
sight
of
one
another
little
louis
fauchard
despite
all
his
wretchedness
began
to
laugh
whilst
the
buxom
julienne
feeling
amused
and
doubtless
as
yet
unconscious
of
social
inequalities
drew
near
and
took
hold
of
his
hands
in
such
wise
that
there
was
sudden
play
fraught
with
childish
delight
as
at
the
prospect
of
some
future
reconciliation
of
the
classes
little
nuisance
cried
dacheux
who
had
quite
lost
his
temper
always
getting
between
my
legs
go
and
sit
down
at
once
then
turning
his
wrath
upon
his
wife
he
roughly
sent
her
back
to
the
cash
desk
saying
that
the
best
thing
she
could
do
was
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
till
so
that
she
might
not
be
robbed
again
as
she
had
been
robbed
only
two
days
previously
and
haunted
as
he
was
by
that
theft
of
which
he
had
never
ceased
to
complain
with
the
greatest
indignation
during
the
last
hours
he
went
on
addressing
himself
to
all
the
people
in
the
shop
indeed
some
kind
of
beggar
woman
crept
in
and
took
five
francs
out
of
the
till
whilst
madame
dacheux
was
looking
to
see
if
the
flies
laughed
she
was
able
to
deny
it
she
still
had
the
money
in
her
hand
oh
i
had
her
taken
into
custody
at
once
she
at
the
gaol
it
is
frightful
frightful
we
shall
be
utterly
robbed
and
plundered
soon
if
we
do
keep
our
eyes
open
then
with
suspicious
glances
he
again
watched
his
meat
to
make
sure
that
no
starving
wretches
no
workwomen
out
of
work
should
carry
any
pieces
away
from
the
show
outside
even
as
they
might
carry
away
precious
gold
divine
gold
from
the
bowls
in
the
windows
of
the
shops
luc
saw
la
fauchard
grow
alarmed
and
retire
she
feared
no
doubt
that
the
butcher
might
summon
a
gendarme
for
a
moment
she
and
her
little
louis
remained
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
street
amidst
all
the
jostling
their
faces
turned
the
while
towards
a
fine
baker
shop
decorated
with
mirrors
and
gaily
lighted
up
which
faced
the
establishment
in
one
of
its
windows
which
was
open
numerous
cakes
and
large
loaves
with
a
crust
of
a
golden
hue
were
freely
displayed
under
the
noses
of
the
before
those
loaves
and
cakes
lingered
the
mother
and
the
child
deep
in
contemplation
and
luc
forgetting
them
became
interested
in
what
was
taking
place
inside
the
shop
a
cart
had
just
stopped
at
the
door
and
a
peasant
had
alighted
from
it
with
a
little
boy
about
eight
years
old
and
a
girl
of
six
at
the
counter
stood
the
baker
wife
the
beautiful
madame
mitaine
a
blonde
who
at
had
remained
superb
the
whole
district
had
been
in
love
with
her
but
she
had
never
ceased
to
be
faithful
to
her
husband
a
thin
silent
man
who
was
seldom
seen
for
he
was
almost
always
busy
at
his
kneading
trough
or
his
oven
on
the
bench
near
his
wife
sat
their
son
Ã©variste
a
lad
of
ten
who
was
already
tall
fair
too
like
his
mother
with
an
amiable
face
and
soft
eyes
is
it
you
monsieur
lenfant
said
madame
mitaine
do
you
do
and
there
your
arsÃ¨ne
and
your
olympe
i
need
not
ask
you
if
they
are
in
good
health
the
peasant
was
a
man
in
the
thirties
with
a
broad
sedate
face
he
did
not
hurry
but
ended
by
answering
in
his
thoughtful
way
yes
their
health
is
good
one
does
get
along
so
badly
at
les
combettes
the
soil
the
most
poorly
i
sha
be
able
to
let
you
have
the
bran
i
promised
you
madame
mitaine
it
all
miscarried
and
as
i
had
to
come
to
beauclair
this
evening
with
the
cart
i
thought
i
let
you
know
he
went
on
giving
expression
to
all
his
rancour
against
the
ungrateful
earth
which
no
longer
fed
the
toiler
nor
even
paid
for
sowing
and
manuring
and
the
beautiful
madame
mitaine
gently
nodded
her
head
it
was
quite
true
one
had
to
work
a
great
deal
nowadays
to
reap
but
little
satisfaction
few
were
able
to
satisfy
their
hunger
she
did
not
busy
herself
with
politics
but
things
were
really
taking
a
very
bad
turn
during
that
strike
for
instance
her
heart
had
almost
burst
at
the
thought
that
a
great
many
poor
people
went
to
bed
without
even
a
crust
to
eat
when
her
shop
was
full
of
loaves
but
trade
was
trade
was
it
not
one
could
not
give
one
goods
away
for
nothing
particularly
as
in
doing
so
one
might
seem
to
be
encouraging
rebellion
and
lenfant
approved
her
yes
said
he
his
own
only
fair
that
one
should
get
profit
from
things
when
one
has
taken
trouble
with
them
but
all
the
same
there
are
some
who
want
to
make
too
much
profit
Ã©variste
interested
by
the
sight
of
arsÃ¨ne
and
olympe
had
made
up
his
mind
to
quit
the
counter
and
do
them
the
honours
of
the
shop
and
like
a
big
boy
of
ten
he
smiled
complaisantly
at
the
little
girl
of
six
whose
big
round
head
and
gay
expression
probably
amused
him
them
each
a
little
cake
said
beautiful
madame
mitaine
who
greatly
spoilt
her
son
and
was
bringing
him
up
to
kindly
ways
and
then
as
Ã©variste
began
by
giving
a
cake
to
arsÃ¨ne
she
protested
jestingly
you
must
be
gallant
my
dear
one
ought
to
begin
with
the
ladies
at
this
Ã©variste
and
olympe
all
confusion
began
to
laugh
and
promptly
became
friends
ah
the
dear
little
ones
they
constitute
the
best
part
of
life
if
some
day
they
were
minded
to
be
wise
they
would
not
devour
one
another
as
do
the
folk
of
and
lenfant
went
off
saying
that
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
bring
some
bran
after
all
but
of
course
later
on
madame
mitaine
who
had
accompanied
him
to
her
door
watched
him
climb
into
his
cart
and
drive
down
the
rue
de
brias
and
at
this
moment
luc
noticed
madame
fauchard
dragging
her
little
louis
with
her
and
suddenly
making
up
her
mind
to
approach
the
baker
wife
she
spoke
some
words
which
luc
did
not
catch
a
request
no
doubt
for
further
credit
for
beautiful
madame
mitaine
with
a
gesture
of
consent
immediately
went
into
her
shop
again
and
gave
her
a
large
loaf
which
the
poor
creature
hastened
to
carry
away
to
her
scraggy
bosom
dacheux
amidst
his
suspicious
exasperation
had
watched
the
scene
from
the
opposite
foot
pavement
get
yourself
robbed
he
cried
boxes
of
sardines
have
just
been
stolen
at
caffiaux
they
are
stealing
everywhere
gaily
answered
madame
mitaine
who
had
returned
to
the
threshold
of
her
shop
only
steal
from
the
rich
luc
slowly
went
down
the
rue
de
brias
amidst
the
flocklike
tramping
which
ever
and
ever
increased
it
now
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
terror
were
sweeping
by
as
if
some
gust
of
violence
were
about
to
transport
that
gloomy
silent
throng
then
as
he
reached
the
place
de
la
mairie
he
again
saw
lenfant
cart
this
time
standing
at
the
street
corner
in
front
of
some
large
ironmongery
stores
kept
by
the
laboques
husband
and
wife
the
doors
of
the
establishment
were
wide
open
and
he
heard
some
violent
bartering
going
on
between
the
peasant
and
the
ironmonger
heavens
why
you
charge
as
much
for
your
spades
as
if
they
were
made
of
gold
why
for
this
one
you
ask
two
francs
more
than
usual
monsieur
lenfant
there
has
been
that
cursed
strike
it
is
our
fault
if
the
factories
have
worked
and
if
everything
has
gone
up
in
price
i
pay
more
for
all
metal
goods
and
of
course
i
have
to
make
a
profit
a
profit
yes
but
not
double
prices
ah
you
do
drive
a
trade
it
will
soon
be
impossible
to
buy
a
single
tool
laboque
was
a
short
thin
wizened
man
extremely
active
with
a
ferret
snout
and
eyes
and
he
had
a
wife
of
his
own
size
a
quick
dusky
creature
whose
keenness
in
was
prodigious
they
had
both
begun
life
at
the
fairs
dragging
with
them
a
full
of
picks
rakes
and
saws
which
they
hawked
around
and
having
opened
a
little
shop
at
beauclair
ten
years
back
they
had
managed
to
enlarge
it
each
succeeding
twelvemonth
and
were
now
at
the
head
of
a
very
important
business
as
between
the
factories
of
the
region
and
the
consuming
classes
they
retailed
at
great
profit
the
iron
of
the
abyss
the
chodorges
nails
the
haussers
scythes
and
sickles
the
mirandes
agricultural
appliances
they
battened
on
a
waste
of
wealth
and
strength
with
the
relative
honesty
of
tradespeople
who
practised
robbery
according
to
established
usage
glowing
with
satisfaction
every
evening
when
they
emptied
their
till
and
counted
up
the
money
that
they
had
amassed
levied
as
tribute
on
the
needs
of
others
they
were
like
useless
cogwheels
in
that
social
machine
which
was
now
fast
getting
out
of
order
they
made
it
grate
and
they
consumed
much
of
its
remaining
energy
whilst
the
peasant
and
the
ironmonger
were
disputing
furiously
over
a
reduction
of
a
franc
which
the
former
demanded
luc
again
began
to
examine
the
children
there
were
two
in
the
shop
auguste
a
big
boy
of
twelve
who
was
learning
a
lesson
and
eulalie
a
little
girl
who
seemed
to
be
scarcely
five
years
old
and
who
grave
and
gentle
sat
quietly
on
a
little
chair
as
if
judging
all
the
folk
who
entered
she
had
shown
an
interest
in
arsÃ¨ne
lenfant
from
the
moment
he
crossed
the
threshold
finding
him
to
her
taste
no
doubt
she
greeted
him
like
the
little
body
she
was
and
the
meeting
became
complete
when
a
woman
entered
bringing
a
fifth
child
with
her
this
woman
was
babette
the
wife
of
bourron
the
puddler
a
plump
round
creature
whose
gaiety
nothing
would
ever
dim
and
who
held
by
the
hand
her
daughter
marthe
a
little
thing
but
four
years
old
who
seemed
as
plump
and
as
gay
as
herself
the
child
it
should
be
said
at
once
quitted
her
mother
and
ran
to
auguste
laboque
whom
she
doubtless
knew
babette
meantime
promptly
put
an
end
to
the
bartering
between
the
ironmonger
and
the
peasant
who
agreed
to
halve
the
franc
over
which
they
had
been
disputing
then
the
woman
who
had
brought
back
a
saucepan
purchased
the
previous
day
exclaimed
leaks
monsieur
laboque
i
noticed
it
directly
i
put
it
on
the
fire
i
ca
possibly
keep
a
saucepan
that
leaks
you
know
whilst
laboque
fuming
examined
the
utensil
and
decided
to
give
another
in
exchange
madame
laboque
began
to
speak
of
her
children
they
were
perfect
pests
said
she
they
never
stirred
one
from
her
chair
the
other
from
his
books
it
was
quite
necessary
to
earn
money
for
them
for
they
were
not
a
bit
like
their
parents
nobody
would
ever
find
them
up
and
doing
to
earn
a
pile
meantime
auguste
laboque
listening
to
nothing
stood
smiling
at
marthe
bourron
and
eulalie
laboque
offered
her
little
hand
to
arsÃ¨ne
lenfant
whilst
the
other
lenfant
olympe
thoughtfully
finished
eating
the
cake
which
little
mitaine
had
given
her
and
it
was
altogether
a
very
pleasant
and
moving
scene
instinct
with

amidst
the
burning
atmosphere
of
battle
and
hatred
which
heated
the
streets
you
think
one
can
gain
money
with
such
affairs
as
this
you
are
mistaken
resumed
laboque
handing
another
saucepan
to
babette
are
no
good
workmen
left
they
all
scamp
their
work
nowadays
and
what
a
lot
of
waste
and
loss
there
is
in
a
place
like
ours
whoever
chooses
comes
in
and
what
with
having
to
set
some
of
our
goods
outside
in
the
street
it
just
like
the
fair
of
we
were
robbed
again
this
afternoon
lenfant
who
was
slowly
paying
for
his
spade
expressed
his
astonishment
at
this
all
those
robberies
one
hears
about
really
take
place
then
said
he
take
place
of
course
they
do
it
is
we
who
rob
it
others
who
rob
us
they
remained
out
on
strike
for
two
months
you
know
and
as
they
have
the
money
to
buy
anything
they
steal
whatever
they
can
only
a
couple
of
hours
ago
some
and
were
stolen
out
of
that
case
yonder
it
is
tranquillising
by
any
means
and
he
made
a
gesture
of
sudden
disquietude
turning
pale
and
quivering
as
he
pointed
to
the
threatening
street
crowded
with
the
gloomy
throng
as
if
he
feared
some
hasty
onrush
some
invasion
which
might
sweep
him
the
owner
and
tradesman
away
and
despoil
him
of
everything
and
repeated
babette
with
her
sempiternal
laugh
not
good
to
eat
what
could
people
do
with
them
just
like
caffiaux
over
the
way
he
complains
that
a
box
of
sardines
has
been
stolen
from
him
some
urchin
just
wanted
to
taste
them
no
doubt
she
was
ever
content
ever
convinced
that
things
would
turn
out
well
as
for
that
caffiaux
he
was
surely
a
man
whom
all
the
housewives
ought
to
have
cursed
she
had
just
seen
her
man
bourron
go
into
his
place
with
ragu
and
bourron
would
certainly
break
up
a
piece
there
but
when
all
was
said
it
was
only
natural
that
a
man
should
amuse
himself
a
bit
after
toiling
so
hard
and
having
given
expression
to
this
philosophical
view
she
took
her
little
girl
marthe
by
the
hand
again
and
went
off
well
pleased
with
her
beautiful
new
saucepan
ought
to
have
some
troops
here
you
know
resumed
laboque
explaining
his
views
to
the
peasant
in
favour
of
giving
a
good
lesson
to
all
those
revolutionaries
we
need
a
strong
government
with
a
heavy
fist
to
ensure
respect
for
respectable
things
lenfant
jogged
his
head
with
his
distrustful
common
sense
he
hesitated
to
express
his
opinions
at
last
he
too
went
off
leading
arsÃ¨ne
and
olympe
away
and
saying
i
hope
that
all
these
affairs
between
the
and
the
workmen
wo
end
badly
for
the
last
minute
or
two
luc
had
been
examining
establishment
over
the
road
at
the
other
corner
of
the
rue
de
brias
and
the
place
de
la
mairie
at
first
the
caffiaux
man
and
wife
had
simply
kept
a
grocery
which
now
had
a
very
flourishing
appearance
with
its
display
of
open
sacks
its
piles
of
tinned
provisions
and
all
sorts
of
comestible
goods
protected
by
netting
from
the
nimble
fingers
of
marauders
then
the
idea
had
come
to
them
of
going
into
the
wine
business
and
they
had
rented
an
adjoining
shop
and
had
fitted
it
up
as
a
and
where
nowadays
they
literally
coined
gold
the
hands
employed
at
all
the
neighbouring
works
notably
the
abyss
consumed
a
terrible
amount
of
alcohol
there
was
an
endless
procession
of
them
going
in
and
coming
out
of
caffiaux
establishment
particularly
on
the
saturdays
when
they
were
paid
many
lingered
and
ate
there
and
many
came
away
dead
drunk
the
place
was
a
den
of
poison
where
the
strongest
lost
the
use
of
both
their
heads
and
their
arms
thus
the
idea
at
once
occurred
to
luc
to
enter
it
to
see
what
might
be
going
on
inside
it
was
a
very
simple
matter
as
he
was
to
dine
out
he
might
as
well
dine
there
how
many
times
in
paris
had
not
his
passion
to
learn
everything
about
the
to
dive
to
the
depths
of
their
misery
and
suffering
impelled
him
to
enter
the
very
worst
dens
and
spend
hours
in
them
he
quietly
installed
himself
at
one
of
the
little
tables
near
the
huge
zinc
bar
the
room
was
large
a
dozen
workmen
stood
up
drinking
whilst
others
seated
at
table
drank
shouted
and
played
cards
amidst
the
thick
smoke
from
their
pipes
a
smoke
in
which
the
merely
looked
like
red
spots
and
at
the
very
first
glance
around
him
luc
recognised
ragu
and
bourron
seated
face
to
face
at
a
neighbouring
table
and
shouting
violently
at
one
another
they
had
doubtless
begun
by
drinking
a
quart
of
wine
then
they
had
ordered
an
omelet
some
sausages
and
some
cheese
and
the
quart
bottles
having
followed
one
after
another
they
were
now
very
drunk
what
particularly
interested
luc
however
was
the
presence
of
caffiaux
who
stood
near
their
table
talking
for
his
part
the
young
man
had
ordered
a
slice
of
roast
beef
and
whilst
eating
it
he
listened
caffiaux
was
a
fat
podgy
smiling
man
with
a
paternal
face
i
tell
you
said
he
if
you
had
held
out
only
three
days
longer
you
would
have
had
the
masters
bound
hand
and
foot
at
your
mercy
curse
it
all
you
surely
not
unaware
that
i
on
the
side
of
you
fellows
yes
indeed
you
wo
upset
all
those
blackguardly
exploiters
a
bit
too
soon
ragu
and
bourron
who
were
both
greatly
excited
clapped
him
on
the
arm
yes
yes
they
knew
him
they
were
well
aware
that
he
was
a
good
a
true
friend
but
all
the
same
a
strike
was
too
hard
to
bear
and
it
always
had
to
come
somehow
to
an
end
masters
will
always
be
the
masters
stammered
ragu
you
see
we
have
got
to
put
up
with
them
whilst
giving
them
the
least
we
can
for
their
money
another
quart
caffiaux
you
help
us
to
drink
it
eh
caffiaux
did
not
decline
he
sat
down
he
favoured
violent
views
because
he
had
noticed
that
his
establishment
expanded
after
each
successive
strike
nothing
made
one
so
thirsty
as
quarrelling
the
worker
who
was
exasperated
rushed
upon
drink
rageful
idleness
accustomed
toilers
to
tavern
life
besides
in
times
of
crisis
he
caffiaux
knew
how
to
be
amiable
feeling
certain
that
he
would
be
repaid
he
opened
little
credit
accounts
for
needy
housewives
and
did
not
refuse
the
men
a
glass
of
wine
on
thus
winning
the
reputation
of
being
and
at
the
same
time
helping
on
the
consumption
of
all
the
poison
he
retailed
some
folks
said
however
that
this
caffiaux
with
his
jesuitical
ways
was
a
traitor
a
spy
of
the
masters
of
the
abyss
who
had
helped
him
financially
to
set
up
in
business
in
order
that
he
might
make
the
men
chatter
whilst
he
was
poisoning
them
and
it
all
meant
fatal
perdition
the
wretched
pleasureless
joyless
life
necessitated
the
existence
of
taverns
and
taverns
finished
by
rotting
the
class
briefly
here
was
a
bad
man
and
a
bad
place
a
shop
which
ought
to
have
been
razed
to
the
ground
and
swept
clear
away
luc
attention
was
for
a
moment
drawn
from
the
conversation
near
him
by
the
opening
of
an
inner
door
communicating
with
the
grocery
shop
and
the
appearance
on
the
threshold
of
a
pretty
girl
about
fifteen
years
of
age
this
was
honorine
the
caffiaux
daughter
a
short
slim
brunette
with
fine
black
eyes
she
never
stayed
any
time
in
the
tavern
but
confined
herself
to
serving
grocery
and
on
now
entering
she
merely
called
her
mother
a
stout
smiling
woman
as
unctuous
as
her
husband
who
stood
behind
the
large
zinc
bar
all
those
tradesfolk
so
eager
for
gain
all
those
hard
egotistical
shopkeepers
seemed
to
have
very
fine
children
thought
luc
and
would
those
children
for
ever
and
ever
remain
as
grasping
as
hard
and
as
egotistical
as
their
forerunners
but
all
at
once
a
charming
and
mournful
vision
appeared
before
the
young
man
amidst
the
pestilential
odours
the
thickening
the
noise
of
a
scuffle
which
had
just
broken
out
before
the
bar
he
saw
josine
standing
so
vague
and
blurred
however
that
at
the
first
moment
he
did
not
recognise
her
she
must
have
slipped
in
furtively
leaving
nanet
at
the
door
trembling
and
still
hesitating
she
stood
behind
ragu
who
did
not
see
her
and
for
a
moment
luc
was
able
to
scrutinise
her
so
slim
in
her
wretched
gown
and
with
so
gentle
and
shadowy
a
face
under
her
ragged
but
he
was
struck
by
something
which
he
had
not
observed
over
yonder
near
the
abyss
her
right
hand
was
no
longer
pressed
against
her
skirt
and
he
could
see
that
it
was
strongly
bandaged
wrapped
round
to
the
wrist
with
linen
doubtless
a
bandage
for
some
injury
which
she
had
received
at
last
josine
mustered
up
all
her
courage
she
must
have
followed
as
far
as
caffiaux
shop
have
glanced
through
the
windows
and
have
seen
ragu
at
table
she
drew
near
with
her
little
faltering
step
and
laid
her
girlish
hand
upon
his
shoulder
but
he
in
the
glow
of
his
intoxication
did
not
even
feel
her
touch
and
she
ended
by
shaking
him
until
he
at
last
turned
round
he
cried
is
it
you
again
what
to
the
do
you
want
here
as
he
spoke
he
dealt
the
table
such
a
thump
with
his
fist
that
the
glasses
and
the
fairly
danced
have
to
come
since
you
do
come
home
she
answered
looking
very
pale
and
half
closing
her
large
frightened
eyes
in
anticipation
of
some
act
of
brutality
but
ragu
was
not
listening
to
her
he
was
working
himself
into
a
frantic
passion
shouting
by
way
of
showing
off
before
all
the
mates
who
were
present
do
what
i
choose
he
cried
i
wo
have
a
woman
spying
on
me
i
my
own
master
do
you
hear
and
i
shall
stop
here
as
long
as
i
please
give
me
the
key
she
said
despairingly
that
at
any
rate
i
may
not
have
to
spend
the
night
in
the
street
key
the
key
shrieked
the
man
ask
me
for
the
key
and
with
furious
savagery
he
rose
up
caught
hold
of
her
by
her
injured
hand
and
dragged
her
down
the
room
to
throw
her
into
the
street
i
told
you
that
it
all
over
that
i
do
mean
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
he
shouted
key
indeed
just
go
and
see
if
it
is
in
the
street
josine
bewildered
and
stumbling
raised
a
piercing
cry
of
pain
you
have
hurt
me
ragu
violence
had
torn
the
bandage
from
her
right
hand
and
the
linen
was
at
once
reddened
by
a
large
bloodstain
but
none
the
less
the
man
blinded
maddened
by
drink
threw
the
door
wide
open
and
pushed
the
woman
into
the
street
then
returning
and
falling
heavily
upon
his
chair
before
his
glass
he
stammered
with
a
husky
laugh
fine
time
of
it
we
should
have
and
no
mistake
if
we
listened
to
them
beside
himself
this
time
quite
enraged
luc
clenched
his
fists
with
the
intention
of
falling
upon
ragu
but
he
foresaw
an
affray
a
useless
battle
with
all
those
brutes
and
feeling
suffocated
in
that
vile
den
he
hastened
to
pay
his
score
whilst
caffiaux
who
had
taken
his
wife
place
at
the
bar
tried
to
arrange
matters
by
saying
in
his
paternal
way
that
some
women
were
very
clumsy
how
could
one
hope
to
get
anything
out
of
a
man
who
had
been
tippling
luc
however
without
answering
hurried
out
and
inhaled
with
relief
the
fresh
air
of
the
street
whilst
searching
among
the
crowd
on
all
sides
for
in
leaving
the
tavern
so
hastily
his
one
idea
had
been
to
rejoin
josine
and
offer
her
some
help
so
that
she
might
not
remain
perishing
of
hunger
breadless
and
homeless
on
that
black
and
stormy
night
but
in
vain
did
he
run
up
the
rue
de
brias
return
to
the
place
de
la
mairie
dart
hither
and
thither
among
the
groups
josine
and
nanet
had
disappeared
terrified
perchance
by
the
thought
of
some
pursuit
they
had
gone
to
earth
somewhere
and
the
rainy
windy
darkness
wrapped
them
round
once
more
how
frightful
was
the
misery
how
hateful
were
the
sufferings
to
be
found
in
spoilt
corrupted
labour
which
had
become
the
vile
ferment
whence
every
degradation
sprang
with
his
heart
bleeding
his
mind
clouded
by
the
blackest
apprehensions
luc
again
wandered
through
the
threatening
crowd
whose
numbers
still
increased
in
the
rue
de
brias
he
once
more
found
there
that
vague
atmosphere
of
terror
which
had
come
from
the
recent
struggle
between
the
classes
a
struggle
which
never
finished
whose
near
return
one
could
scent
in
the
very
air
that
resumption
of
work
was
but
a
deceptive
peace
there
was
low
growling
amidst
all
the
resignation
of
the
toilers
a
silent
craving
for
revenge
their
eyes
still
retained
a
gleam
of
ferocity
and
were
ready
to
flash
once
more
on
both
sides
of
the
way
were
taverns
full
of
men
drink
was
consuming
their
pay
poisonous
exhalations
were
pouring
into
the
very
street
whilst
the
shops
never
emptied
but
still
and
ever
levied
on
the
meagre
resources
of
the
housewives
that
iniquitous
and
monstrous
tribute
called
gain
everywhere
upon
every
side
the
toilers
the
starvelings
were
exploited
preyed
upon
caught
and
crushed
in
the
works
of
the
social
machine
whose
teeth
proved
all
the
harder
now
that
it
was
falling
to
pieces
and
in
the
mud
under
the
wildly
flickering
gaslights
as
on
the
eve
of
some
great
catastrophe
all
beauclair
came
and
went
tramping
about
like
a
lost
flock
going
blindly
towards
the
pit
of
destruction
among
the
crowd
luc
recognised
several
persons
whom
he
had
seen
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
beauclair
during
the
previous
spring
the
authorities
were
there
for
fear
no
doubt
of
something
being
amiss
he
saw
mayor
gourier
and
chÃ¢telard
pass
on
together
the
first
a
nervous
man
of
large
property
would
have
liked
to
have
troops
in
the
town
but
the
second
an
amiable
waif
of
parisian
life
whose
intellect
was
sharper
had
wisely
contented
himself
with
the
services
of
the
gendarmes
gaume
the
presiding
judge
of
the
local
court
also
went
by
accompanied
by
captain
jollivet
an
officer
on
the
retired
list
who
was
about
to
marry
his
daughter
and
as
they
passed
shop
they
paused
to
exchange
greetings
with
the
mazelles
some
former
tradespeople
who
thanks
to
a
rapidly
acquired
income
had
finally
been
received
into
the
high
society
of
the
town
all
these
folks
spoke
in
low
voices
with
scarcely
confident
expressions
on
their
faces
as
they
glanced
sideways
at
the
heavily
tramping
toilers
who
were
still
keeping
up
saturday
evening
as
luc
passed
near
the
mazelles
he
heard
them
also
speaking
of
the
robberies
as
if
questioning
the
judge
and
the
captain
on
the
subject
was
indeed
flying
from
mouth
to
mouth
a
piece
had
been
taken
from
till
a
box
of
sardines
had
been
abstracted
from
caffiaux
shop
but
the
gravest
commentaries
were
those
to
which
the
theft
of
gave
rise
the
terror
which
was
in
the
air
gained
upon
sensible
people
was
it
true
then
that
the
revolutionaries
were
arming
themselves
and
purposed
carrying
out
some
massacre
that
very
night
that
stormy
night
which
hung
so
heavily
over
beauclair
that
disastrous
strike
had
put
everything
out
of
gear
hunger
was
impelling
wretches
hither
and
thither
the
poisonous
alcohol
of
the
taverns
was
breeding
destructive
and
murderous
madness
truly
enough
right
along
the
filthy
muddy
roadway
along
the
sticky
one
found
all
the
poisononsness
and
degradation
that
come
from
iniquitous
toil
the
toil
of
the
greater
number
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
few
labour
dishonoured
hated
and
cursed
the
frightful
misery
that
results
therefrom
together
with
theft
and
prostitution
which
are
its
monstrous
parasitic
growths
pale
girls
passed
by
factory
girls
whom
some
unprincipled
men
had
led
astray
and
who
had
afterwards
sunk
to
the
gutter
and
drunken
men
went
off
with
them
through
all
the
puddles
and
the
darkness
increasing
compassion
rebellion
compounded
of
grief
and
anger
took
possession
of
luc
where
could
josine
be
in
what
horrid
dark
nook
had
she
sought
refuge
with
little
nanet
but
all
at
once
a
clamour
arose
a
hurricane
seemed
to
sweep
over
the
crowd
first
making
it
whirl
and
then
carrying
it
away
one
might
have
thought
that
an
attack
was
being
made
upon
the
shops
that
the
provisions
exposed
for
sale
on
either
side
of
the
street
were
being
pillaged
gendarmes
rushed
forward
there
was
scampering
hither
and
thither
a
loud
clatter
of
boots
and
of
sabres
what
was
the
matter
what
was
the
matter
questions
pressed
one
upon
the
other
flew
about
in
stammering
accents
amidst
the
growing
terror
whilst
answers
came
back
wildly
from
every
side
at
last
luc
heard
the
mazelles
saying
as
they
retraced
their
steps
a
child
who
has
stolen
a
loaf
of
bread
the
snarling
excited
crowd
was
now
rushing
up
the
street
the
affair
must
have
taken
place
at
mitaine
shop
women
shrieked
an
old
man
fell
down
and
had
to
be
picked
up
one
fat
gendarme
ran
so
impetuously
through
the
groups
that
he
upset
two
persons
luc
himself
began
to
run
carried
away
by
the
general
panic
and
as
he
passed
near
judge
gaume
he
heard
him
saying
slowly
to
captain
jollivet
a
child
who
has
stolen
a
loaf
of
bread
that
answer
came
back
again
punctuated
as
it
were
by
the
rush
of
the
crowd
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
scrambling
and
nothing
could
yet
be
seen
the
tradespeople
standing
on
the
thresholds
of
their
shops
turned
pale
and
thought
of
putting
up
their
shutters
a
jeweller
was
already
removing
the
watches
from
his
window
meantime
a
general
eddying
took
place
around
the
fat
gendarme
who
was
busy
exerting
his
elbows
then
luc
beside
whom
mayor
gourier
and
chÃ¢telard
were
also
running
again
detected
the
words
the
pitiful
murmur
rising
amidst
a
little
shudder
a
child
who
has
stolen
a
loaf
of
bread
at
last
as
the
young
man
was
just
reaching
mitaine
shop
in
the
wake
of
the
fat
gendarme
he
saw
him
rush
forward
to
assist
a
comrade
a
long
lanky
gendarme
who
was
roughly
holding
a
boy
between
five
and
six
years
old
by
the
wrist
and
in
this
boy
luc
at
once
recognised
nanet
with
his
fair
tumbled
head
which
he
still
carried
erect
with
the
resolute
air
of
a
little
man
he
had
just
stolen
a
loaf
of
bread
from
beautiful
madame
mitaine
open
window
the
theft
could
not
be
denied
for
the
lad
was
still
holding
the
big
loaf
which
was
nearly
as
tall
as
himself
and
so
it
was
really
this
childish
act
of
larceny
which
had
upset
and
excited
the
whole
rue
de
brias
some
having
noticed
it
had
denounced
it
to
the
gendarme
who
had
set
off
at
a
run
but
the
lad
on
his
side
had
slipped
away
very
fast
disappearing
among
the
groups
and
the
gendarme
raising
a
perfect
hullabaloo
in
his
desperation
had
nearly
turned
all
beauclair
he
was
triumphant
now
for
he
had
captured
the
culprit
and
had
brought
him
back
to
the
scene
of
the
theft
to
confound
him
a
child
who
has
stolen
a
loaf
of
bread
the
people
repeated
madame
mitaine
astonished
at
such
an
uproar
had
come
once
more
to
the
door
of
her
shop
and
she
was
quite
when
the
gendarme
addressing
her
exclaimed
is
the
young
vagabond
who
just
stole
a
loaf
of
yours
madame
then
he
gave
nanet
a
shake
in
order
to
frighten
him
go
to
gaol
you
know
he
said
did
you
steal
that
loaf
eh
but
the
little
fellow
was
not
put
out
he
answered
clearly
in
his
voice
had
nothing
to
eat
since
yesterday
nor
my
sister
either
meantime
madame
mitaine
had
recovered
her
she
was
looking
at
the
little
lad
with
her
beautiful
eyes
so
full
of
indulgent
kindness
poor
little
devil
and
his
sister
where
had
he
left
her
for
a
moment
the
baker
wife
hesitated
whilst
a
slight
flush
rose
to
her
cheeks
then
with
the
amiable
laugh
of
a
handsome
woman
accustomed
to
be
courted
by
all
her
customers
she
said
in
her
gay
quiet
way
are
mistaken
gendarme
that
child
did
steal
the
loaf
i
gave
it
him
without
relaxing
his
hold
on
nanet
the
gendarme
stood
before
her
gaping
ten
people
had
seen
the
boy
take
the
loaf
and
run
off
with
it
and
all
at
once
butcher
dacheux
who
had
crossed
the
street
intervened
in
a
furious
passion
i
saw
him
myself
i
was
looking
this
way
at
the
very
moment
he
threw
himself
on
the
biggest
of
the
loaves
and
then
took
to
his
heels
that
how
it
happened
as
true
as
i
was
robbed
of
five
francs
the
day
before
yesterday
as
true
as
laboque
and
caffiaux
have
been
robbed
that
little
vermin
has
just
robbed
you
madame
mitaine
and
you
ca
deny
it
quite
pink
from
having
told
a
fib
the
baker
wife
none
the
less
repeated
gently
are
mistaken
neighbour
it
was
i
who
gave
the
child
that
loaf
he
did
not
steal
it
then
as
dacheux
flew
into
a
temper
with
her
predicting
that
by
her
foolish
indulgence
she
would
end
by
having
them
all
pillaged
and
massacred
chÃ¢telard
who
had
judged
the
scene
at
a
glance
like
a
shrewd
man
approached
the
gendarme
and
made
him
release
nanet
to
whom
in
a
loud
whisper
he
said
with
you
quick
youngster
the
crowd
was
already
growling
why
the
baker
wife
herself
declared
that
she
had
given
the
boy
the
loaf
a
poor
little
beggar
no
higher
than
a
who
had
been
fasting
since
the
previous
day
exclamations
and
hisses
arose
and
suddenly
a
thunderous
voice
made
itself
heard
above
every
other
curse
it
so
little
urchins
six
years
old
have
to
set
us
the
example
now
the
child
did
right
when
one
hungry
one
may
take
whatever
one
wants
yes
everything
in
the
shops
is
ours
and
if
you
are
all
starving
it
simply
because
you
are
cowards
the
throng
swayed
about
and
eddied
back
as
when
a
is
flung
into
a
pond
is
it
people
asked
and
at
once
came
back
replies
lange
the
potter
amidst
the
groups
which
drew
aside
luc
then
saw
the
man
who
had
spoken
a
short
man
barely
with
a
head
bushy
with
black
hair
and
beard
of
a
rustic
appearance
but
with
a
glow
of
intelligence
in
his
eyes
he
went
on
speaking
proclaiming
the
dream
of
his
life
aloud
in
soaring
but
unpolished
language
like
a
poet
yet
in
the
rough
and
he
made
no
gestures
but
quietly
kept
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
money
and
houses
and
clothes
said
he
have
all
been
stolen
from
us
and
we
have
a
right
to
take
them
all
back
and
not
but
this
very
evening
if
we
were
men
we
ought
to
resume
possession
of
the
soil
the
mines
the
factories
all
beauclair
indeed
there
are
no
two
ways
of
doing
it
there
is
only
one
to
throw
the
whole
edifice
on
the
ground
at
one
blow
to
poleaxe
and
destroy
authority
everywhere
so
that
the
people
to
whom
everything
belongs
may
at
last
build
up
the
world
anew
women
took
fright
on
hearing
this
even
the
men
in
presence
of
the
aggressive
vehemence
of
lange
words
became
silent
and
retreated
anxious
as
to
the
consequences
few
of
them
really
understood
the
greater
number
beneath
the
grinding
bondage
of
the
system
had
not
as
yet
reached
such
a
degree
of
embittered
rebellion
what
was
the
good
of
it
they
would
none
the
less
die
of
starvation
and
go
to
prison
they
thought
you
do
dare
i
know
it
continued
lange
with
terrible
sarcasm
there
are
others
who
will
dare
some
day
your
beauclair
will
be
blown
up
unless
it
falls
to
pieces
from
sheer
rottenness
your
noses
ca
be
worth
much
if
you
are
unable
to
smell
this
evening
that
everything
rotten
and
stinks
of
putrefaction
there
is
only
so
much
dung
left
and
one
does
need
to
be
a
great
prophet
to
predict
that
the
wind
which
blows
will
some
day
sweep
away
the
town
and
all
the
thieves
and
all
the
murderers
our
masters
ah
may
everything
tumble
down
and
break
to
pieces
to
death
to
death
with
all
of
it
the
scandal
was
becoming
so
great
that
chÃ¢telard
though
he
would
have
preferred
to
treat
the
matter
with
indifference
found
himself
obliged
to
exercise
his
authority
somebody
had
to
be
arrested
so
three
gendarmes
sprang
upon
lange
and
led
him
off
down
a
gloomy
deserted
side
street
where
their
heavy
footfalls
died
away
the
crowd
itself
had
shown
but
vague
contradictory
impulses
which
were
promptly
quieted
and
the
gathering
was
broken
up
and
the
tramping
began
afresh
slow
and
silent
through
the
black
mud
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
street
but
luc
had
shuddered
that
prophetic
threat
had
burst
forth
like
the
frightful
fated
outcome
of
all
that
he
had
seen
all
that
he
had
heard
since
the
fall
of
daylight
such
an
abundance
of
iniquity
and
wretchedness
called
for
a
final
catastrophe
which
he
himself
felt
approaching
from
the
depths
beyond
the
horizon
in
the
form
perchance
of
some
avenging
cloud
of
fire
which
would
consume
and
raze
beauclair
to
the
ground
and
with
his
horror
of
all
violence
luc
suffered
at
the
thought
of
it
what
could
the
potter
be
right
would
force
would
theft
and
murder
be
necessary
for
mankind
to
find
itself
once
more
within
the
pale
of
justice
in
his
distracted
state
it
had
seemed
to
luc
that
amidst
all
the
harsh
sombre
faces
of
the
toilers
he
had
seen
the
pale
countenances
of
mayor
gourier
judge
gaume
and
captain
jollivet
flit
past
him
then
too
the
faces
of
the
mazelles
perspiring
with
terror
darted
by
in
the
flickering
light
of
a
the
street
horrified
him
and
only
one
compassionate
consolatory
thought
remained
that
of
overtaking
nanet
following
him
and
ascertaining
into
what
dark
nook
the
unhappy
josine
had
fallen
the
lad
was
walking
on
and
on
with
all
the
courage
of
his
little
legs
luc
who
had
seen
him
go
off
up
the
rue
de
brias
in
the
direction
of
the
abyss
overtook
him
fairly
rapidly
for
the
dear
little
fellow
had
great
difficulty
in
carrying
his
big
loaf
he
pressed
it
to
his
chest
with
both
his
hands
from
fear
of
dropping
it
and
from
fear
too
lest
some
man
or
some
big
dog
might
tear
it
from
him
on
hearing
luc
hasty
footsteps
in
the
rear
he
no
doubt
felt
extremely
frightened
for
he
attempted
to
run
but
on
glancing
round
he
recognised
by
the
light
of
one
of
the
last
the
gentleman
who
had
smiled
at
him
and
his
big
sister
and
thereupon
he
felt
reassured
and
allowed
himself
to
be
overtaken
i
carry
your
loaf
for
you
the
young
man
asked
no
i
want
to
keep
it
it
pleases
me
said
the
boy
they
were
now
on
the
high
road
beyond
beauclair
in
the
darkness
falling
from
the
low
and
stormy
sky
the
lights
of
the
abyss
alone
gleamed
forth
some
distance
off
and
one
could
hear
the
child
splashing
through
the
mud
whilst
he
raised
his
loaf
as
high
as
possible
so
that
it
might
not
get
dirty
know
where
you
are
going
asked
luc
course
it
very
far
it
somewhere
a
vague
fear
must
have
been
stealing
over
nanet
again
for
his
steps
slackened
why
did
the
gentleman
want
to
know
feeling
that
he
was
his
big
sister
only
protector
the
little
man
sought
to
devise
some
ruse
but
luc
who
guessed
his
feelings
and
wished
to
show
him
that
he
was
a
friend
began
to
play
with
him
catching
him
in
his
arms
at
the
moment
when
he
narrowly
missed
stumbling
in
a
puddle
out
my
boy
you
must
get
any
on
your
bread
conquered
having
felt
the
affectionate
warmth
of
those
big
brotherly
arms
nanet
burst
into
the
careless
laugh
of
childhood
and
said
to
his
new
friend
you
are
strong
and
kind
you
are
then
he
went
trotting
on
without
showing
further
disquietude
but
where
could
josine
have
hidden
herself
the
road
stretched
out
and
in
the
motionless
shadow
of
each
successive
tree
luc
fancied
he
could
see
her
waiting
he
was
drawing
near
the
abyss
the
ground
already
shook
with
the
heavy
blows
of
the
whilst
the
surroundings
were
illumined
by
a
fiery
cloud
of
vapour
traversed
by
the
broad
rays
of
the
electric
lights
nanet
without
going
past
the
abyss
turned
towards
the
bridge
and
crossed
the
mionne
thus
luc
found
himself
brought
back
to
the
very
spot
where
he
had
first
met
the
boy
and
his
sister
earlier
in
the
evening
but
all
at
once
the
lad
rushed
off
and
the
young
man
lost
sight
of
him
and
heard
him
call
whilst
once
more
laughing
playfully
big
sister
here
big
sister
look
at
this
see
how
fine
it
is
beyond
the
bridge
the
river
bank
became
lower
and
a
bench
stood
there
in
the
shadow
cast
by
some
palings
facing
the
abyss
which
smoked
and
panted
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
luc
had
just
knocked
against
the
palings
when
he
heard
the
urchin
laughter
turn
into
cries
and
tears
he
took
his
bearings
and
understood
everything
when
he
perceived
josine
lying
exhausted
in
a
swoon
upon
the
bench
she
had
fallen
there
overcome
by
hunger
and
suffering
letting
her
little
brother
go
off
and
scarcely
understanding
what
he
with
the
boldness
of
a
lad
of
the
streets
had
intended
to
do
and
now
the
child
finding
her
cold
as
if
lifeless
sobbed
loudly
and
despairingly
big
sister
wake
up
wake
up
you
must
eat
do
eat
there
bread
now
tears
had
come
to
luc
eyes
also
to
think
that
so
much
misery
such
a
frightful
destiny
of
privation
and
suffering
should
fall
upon
such
weak
yet
courageous
creatures
he
quickly
descended
to
the
mionne
dipped
his
handkerchief
in
the
water
and
came
back
and
applied
it
to
josine
temples
fortunately
that
tragic
night
was
not
a
very
cold
one
at
last
he
took
hold
of
the
young
woman
hands
rubbed
them
and
warmed
them
with
his
own
and
finally
she
sighed
and
seemed
to
awaken
from
some
black
dream
but
in
her
prostrate
condition
due
to
lack
of
food
nothing
astonished
her
it
appeared
to
her
quite
natural
that
her
brother
should
be
there
with
that
loaf
accompanied
too
by
that
tall
and
handsome
gentleman
whom
she
recognised
perhaps
she
imagined
that
it
was
the
gentleman
who
had
brought
the
bread
her
poor
weak
fingers
could
not
break
the
crust
he
had
to
help
her
break
the
bread
into
little
pieces
which
he
passed
her
slowly
one
by
one
so
that
she
might
not
choke
herself
in
her
haste
to
quiet
the
atrocious
hunger
which
griped
her
and
then
the
whole
of
her
poor
thin
spare
figure
began
to
tremble
and
she
wept
wept
on
unceasingly
whilst
still
eating
thus
moistening
each
mouthful
with
her
tears
ere
she
devoured
it
voraciously
evincing
the
while
the
shivering
clumsiness
of
some
eager
beaten
animal
which
no
longer
knows
how
to
swallow
luc
distracted
with
a
pang
at
his
heart
gently
restrained
her
hands
whilst
still
giving
her
the
little
pieces
which
he
broke
off
the
loaf
never
could
he
afterwards
forget
that
communion
of
suffering
and
kindliness
that
bread
of
life
thus
given
to
the
most
woeful
and
sweetest
of
human
creatures
nanet
meantime
broke
off
his
own
share
and
ate
like
a
little
glutton
proud
of
his
exploit
his
sister
tears
astonished
him
why
did
she
still
weep
when
they
were
feasting
then
having
finished
quite
oppressed
by
his
ravenous
feast
he
nestled
close
beside
her
and
was
overpowered
by
sudden
somnolence
the
happy
sleep
of
childhood
which
beholds
the
angels
in
its
dreams
and
josine
pressed
him
to
her
with
her
right
arm
leaning
back
against
the
bench
and
feeling
a
trifle
stronger
whilst
luc
remained
seated
by
her
side
unable
to
leave
her
like
that
alone
in
the
night
with
that
sleeping
child
he
had
understood
at
last
that
some
of
the
clumsiness
that
she
had
shown
in
eating
had
been
due
to
her
injured
hand
around
which
as
well
as
she
could
manage
she
had
again
wound
her
bloodstained
bandage
have
injured
yourself
he
said
monsieur
a
machine
broke
one
of
my
fingers
and
i
had
to
have
it
cut
off
but
it
was
my
fault
so
the
foreman
said
though
monsieur
gourier
gave
me
fifty
francs
she
spoke
in
a
somewhat
low
and
very
gentle
voice
which
trembled
at
moments
as
with
a
kind
of
shame
you
worked
at
the
belonging
to
monsieur
gourier
the
mayor
monsieur
i
first
went
there
when
i
was
fifteen
i
eighteen
now
my
mother
worked
there
more
than
twenty
years
but
she
is
dead
i
all
alone
i
only
my
little
brother
nanet
who
is
just
six
my
name
josine
and
she
went
on
telling
her
story
in
such
wise
that
luc
only
had
to
ask
a
few
more
questions
to
learn
everything
it
was
the
commonplace
distressful
story
of
so
many
poor
girls
a
father
who
goes
off
with
another
woman
a
mother
who
remains
stranded
with
four
children
for
whom
she
is
unable
to
earn
sufficient
food
although
she
luckily
loses
two
of
them
she
dies
at
last
from
the
effect
of
and
then
the
daughter
just
sixteen
years
of
age
has
to
become
a
mother
to
her
little
brother
in
her
turn
killing
herself
with
hard
work
though
at
times
she
is
unable
to
earn
bread
enough
for
herself
and
the
boy
then
comes
the
inevitable
tragedy
which
dogs
the
footsteps
of
a
workgirl
a
seducer
passes
the
rakish
ragu
on
whose
arm
she
imprudently
strolls
each
sunday
after
the
dance
he
makes
her
such
fine
promises
she
already
pictures
herself
married
with
a
pretty
home
in
which
she
brings
up
her
brother
together
with
the
children
that
may
come
to
her
her
only
fault
is
that
one
evening
in
springtime
she
stumbles
how
it
was
she
hardly
remembers
and
six
months
later
she
is
guilty
of
a
second
fault
that
of
going
to
live
with
ragu
who
speaks
no
more
to
her
of
marriage
then
her
accident
befalls
her
at
the
and
she
finds
herself
unable
to
continue
working
at
the
very
moment
when
the
strike
has
rendered
ragu
so
rageful
and
spiteful
that
he
has
begun
to
beat
her
accusing
her
of
being
the
cause
of
his
own
misery
and
from
that
moment
things
go
from
bad
to
worse
and
now
he
has
turned
her
into
the
street
and
will
not
even
give
her
the
key
so
that
she
may
go
home
to
bed
with
nanet
whilst
the
girl
went
on
talking
it
seemed
to
luc
that
if
she
should
have
a
child
by
ragu
he
might
become
attached
to
her
and
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
however
when
the
young
man
hinted
this
to
josine
she
speedily
undeceived
him
no
nothing
of
that
was
at
all
likely
then
silence
fell
they
no
longer
spoke
the
certainty
that
josine
was
not
a
mother
that
she
would
never
bear
children
to
that
man
ragu
brought
luc
amidst
his
dolorous
compassion
a
singular
feeling
of
relief
for
which
he
was
unable
to
account
vague
ideas
arose
in
his
mind
whilst
his
eyes
wandered
far
away
over
the
dim
scene
before
him
and
he
again
discerned
that
gorge
of
brias
which
he
had
viewed
in
the
twilight
before
it
was
steeped
in
shadows
on
either
side
where
the
bleuse
mountains
reared
their
flights
of
rocks
the
darkness
became
more
dense
midway
up
the
height
behind
him
the
young
man
now
and
again
heard
the
passing
rumble
of
a
train
which
whistled
and
slowed
down
as
it
approached
the
station
at
his
feet
he
distinguished
the
glaucous
mionne
rippling
against
the
stockade
whose
beams
upheld
the
bridge
and
then
on
his
left
came
the
sudden
widening
of
the
gorge
the
two
promontories
of
the
bleuse
mountains
drawing
aside
on
the
verge
of
the
vast
roumagne
plain
where
the
tempestuous
night
rolled
on
like
a
black
and
endless
sea
beyond
the
vague
eyot
of
beauclair
where
constellated
hundreds
of
little
lights
suggesting
sparks
but
luc
eyes
ever
came
back
to
the
abyss
in
front
of
him
it
showed
forth
like
some
weird
apparition
under
clouds
of
white
smoke
fired
so
it
seemed
by
the
electric
lamps
in
the
yards
through
open
doorways
and
other
apertures
one
at
times
perceived
the
blazing
mouths
of
the
furnaces
with
now
a
blinding
flow
of
fusing
metal
now
a
huge
ruddy
glare
all
the
internal
hellish
flames
indeed
of
the
devouring
tumultuous
work
the
ground
quaked
all
around
whilst
the
ringing
dance
of
the
never
ceased
to
sound
above
the
dull
rumbling
of
the
machinery
and
the
deep
blows
of
the
great
which
suggested
a
cannonade
and
luc
with
his
eyes
full
of
that
vision
his
heart
lacerated
by
the
thought
of
the
fate
that
had
befallen
that
hapless
josine
now
reclining
in
utter
abandonment
and
wretchedness
on
that
bench
beside
him
said
to
himself
that
in
this
poor
creature
resounded
the
whole
collapse
of
labour
evilly
organised
dishonoured
and
accursed
in
that
supreme
suffering
in
that
human
sacrifice
ended
all
his
experiences
of
the
evening
the
disasters
of
the
strike
the
hatred
poisoning
men
hearts
and
minds
the
egotistical
harshness
of
trade
the
triumph
of
drink
which
had
become
necessary
to
stimulate
forgetfulness
the
legitimation
of
theft
by
hunger
the
cracking
and
rending
of
society
beneath
the
very
weight
of
its
own
iniquities
and
he
fancied
that
he
could
again
hear
lange
predicting
the
final
catastrophe
which
would
sweep
away
that
beauclair
which
was
rotten
itself
and
which
rotted
everything
that
came
in
contact
with
it
and
he
saw
once
more
also
the
pale
girls
wandering
over
the
pavement
those
sorry
offspring
of
manufacturing
towns
where
the
vile
invariably
brings
about
the
ruin
of
the
factory
hands
was
it
not
to
a
similar
fate
that
josine
herself
was
drifting
he
could
divine
that
she
was
a
submissive
a
loving
creature
one
of
those
tender
natures
that
give
courage
to
the
strong
and
prove
their
reward
and
the
thought
of
abandoning
her
on
that
bench
of
doing
nothing
to
save
her
from
accursed
fate
filled
him
with
such
revolt
that
he
would
have
for
ever
reproached
himself
had
he
not
offered
her
a
helping
and
a
brotherly
hand
you
can
not
sleep
here
with
that
child
he
said
man
must
take
you
back
for
the
rest
we
see
afterwards
where
do
you
live
by
in
the
rue
des
trois
lunes
in
old
beauclair
she
replied
then
she
explained
things
to
him
ragu
occupied
a
little
lodging
of
three
rooms
in
the
same
house
as
one
of
his
sisters
adÃ¨le
nicknamed
la
toupe
and
she
suspected
that
if
ragu
really
had
not
got
the
key
with
him
he
must
have
handed
it
to
la
toupe
who
was
a
terrible
creature
when
the
young
man
spoke
of
quietly
going
to
her
and
asking
her
for
the
key
josine
shuddered
no
you
must
not
ask
her
she
hates
me
if
one
could
only
come
upon
her
husband
who
a
man
but
i
know
that
he
works
at
the
abyss
he
a
master
puddler
named
bonnaire
luc
repeated
a
recollection
awakening
within
him
i
saw
him
when
i
visited
the
abyss
last
spring
i
even
had
a
long
talk
with
him
he
explained
the
work
to
me
he
an
intelligent
fellow
and
as
you
say
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
well
it
quite
simple
i
will
go
and
speak
to
him
about
you
josine
raised
a
cry
of
heartfelt
gratitude
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
she
clasped
her
hands
as
her
whole
being
went
out
towards
the
young
man
monsieur
how
good
you
are
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
a
sombre
glow
was
now
rising
from
the
abyss
and
luc
as
he
glanced
at
her
saw
her
this
time
for
her
ragged
wrapper
had
fallen
over
her
shoulders
she
was
no
longer
weeping
her
blue
eyes
gleamed
with
tenderness
and
her
little
mouth
had
found
once
more
its
youthful
smile
with
her
supple
graceful
slimness
she
had
retained
quite
a
childish
air
she
looked
like
one
who
was
still
playful
simple
and
gay
her
long
fair
hair
of
the
hue
of
ripe
oats
had
fallen
half
unbound
over
the
nape
of
her
neck
and
lent
her
quite
a
girlish
and
candid
appearance
in
her
abandonment
he
infinitely
charmed
by
degrees
quite
captivated
felt
moved
and
astonished
at
the
sight
of
the
winning
creature
that
seemed
to
emerge
from
the
poor
beggarly
being
whom
he
had
met
badly
clad
frightened
and
weeping
and
besides
she
looked
at
him
with
so
much
adoration
she
surrendered
to
him
so
candidly
her
soul
like
one
who
at
last
felt
herself
succoured
and
loved
handsome
and
kind
as
he
was
he
seemed
to
her
a
very
god
after
all
the
brutality
of
ragu
she
would
have
kissed
his
very
footprints
and
she
stood
before
him
with
her
hands
still
clasped
the
left
pressing
the
right
the
mutilated
hand
round
which
was
wrapped
the
bloodstained
bandage
and
something
very
sweet
and
very
strong
seemed
to
bind
her
and
him
together
a
link
of
infinite
tenderness
infinite
affection
will
take
you
to
the
works
monsieur
she
said
knows
every
corner
of
them
no
i
know
my
way
do
awake
him
he
will
keep
you
warm
wait
here
for
me
quietly
both
of
you
he
left
her
on
the
bench
in
the
black
night
with
the
sleeping
child
and
as
he
stepped
away
a
great
glow
illumined
the
promontory
of
the
bleuse
mountains
on
the
right
above
the
park
of
la
crÃªcherie
where
stood
jordan
house
the
sombre
silhouette
of
the
blast
furnace
could
be
seen
on
the
mountain
side
a
of
metal
flowed
forth
and
all
the
neighbouring
rocks
even
all
the
roofs
of
beauclair
were
illumined
by
it
as
by
some
bright
red
dawn
literally
big
one
sister
we
have
no
exact
equivalent
for
this
expression
as
a
form
of
endearment
nor
for
the
ensuing
one
little
each

bonnaire
the
master
puddler
one
of
the
best
hands
of
the
works
had
played
an
important
part
in
the
recent
strike
a
man
of
just
mind
indignant
with
the
iniquity
of
the
system
he
read
the
paris
newspapers
and
derived
from
them
a
revolutionary
education
in
which
there
were
many
gaps
but
which
had
made
him
a
fairly
frank
partisan
of
collectivist
doctrines
as
he
himself
with
the
fine
equilibrium
of
a
healthy
man
very
reasonably
said
collectivism
was
the
dream
whose
realisation
they
would
some
day
seek
and
meantime
it
was
necessary
to
secure
as
much
justice
as
might
be
immediately
obtained
in
order
to
reduce
the
sufferings
of
the
workers
to
a
minimum
the
strike
had
been
for
some
time
inevitable
three
years
previously
the
abyss
having
nearly
come
to
grief
in
the
hands
of
monsieur
son
michel
qurignon
the
latter
boisgelin
an
idler
a
fine
paris
gentleman
had
purchased
the
works
investing
in
them
all
that
remained
of
his
jeopardised
fortune
on
the
advice
of
a
poor
cousin
a
certain
delaveau
who
had
positively
undertaken
to
make
the
capital
invested
yield
a
profit
of
thirty
per
cent
per
annum
and
for
three
years
delaveau
a
skilful
engineer
and
a
determined
hard
worker
had
kept
his
promise
thanks
to
energetic
management
and
organisation
strict
attention
to
the
minutest
details
and
absolute
discipline
on
all
sides
michel
qurignon
ill
success
in
business
had
been
partly
due
to
the
difficulties
which
had
beset
the
metal
market
of
the
region
ever
since
the
manufacture
of
iron
rails
and
girders
had
there
ceased
to
be
remunerative
owing
to
the
discovery
of
certain
chemical
processes
which
in
northern
and
eastern
france
had
enabled
ironmasters
to
make
use
very
cheaply
of
large
quantities
of
ore
which
previously
had
been
regarded
as
too
defective
the
beauclair
works
could
not
possibly
turn
out
the
same
class
of
goods
so
cheaply
as
their
competitors
ruin
therefore
seemed
inevitable
and
stroke
of
talent
consisted
in
changing
the
character
of
the
output
in
giving
up
the
manufacture
of
rails
and
girders
which
northern
and
eastern
france
could
supply
at
twenty
centimes
the
kilogramme
and
confining
himself
to
the
manufacture
of
things
such
indeed
as
projectiles
and
ordnance
shells
and
cannon
which
brought
in
from
two
to
three
francs
per
kilogramme
prosperity
had
then
returned
and
boisgelin
investment
brought
him
in
a
considerable
income
only
it
had
been
necessary
to
obtain
a
quantity
of
new
plant
and
to
secure
the
services
of
more
careful
and
attentive
workmen
who
necessarily
required
to
be
better
paid
than
others
in
principle
the
strike
had
been
brought
about
by
that
very
question
of
better
pay
the
men
were
paid
by
the
hundred
kilogrammes
and
delaveau
himself
admitted
the
necessity
of
a
new
wage
tariff
but
he
wished
to
remain
absolute
master
of
the
situation
desiring
above
all
things
to
avoid
anything
which
might
seem
like
surrender
on
his
part
to
the
pressure
of
his
workpeople
with
a
specialist
mind
very
authoritative
in
disposition
and
stubborn
with
respect
to
his
rights
whilst
striving
to
be
just
and
loyal
he
regarded
collectivism
as
a
destructive
dream
and
declared
that
any
such
utopian
doctrine
would
lead
one
direct
to
the
most
awful
catastrophes
the
quarrel
on
this
point
between
him
and
the
little
world
of
workers
over
whom
he
reigned
became
a
fierce
one
directly
bonnaire
succeeded
in
setting
a
defensive
syndicate
on
foot
for
if
delaveau
admitted
the
desirability
of
relief
and
pension
funds
and
even
of
societies
supplying
cheap
provisions
and
other
necessaries
thus
recognising
that
the
workman
was
not
forbidden
to
improve
his
position
he
at
the
same
time
violently
condemned
all
syndicates
and
class
grouping
designed
for
collective
action
from
that
moment
then
the
struggle
began
delaveau
showed
great
unwillingness
to
complete
the
revision
of
the
tariffs
and
thought
it
necessary
in
his
turn
to
arm
himself
in
some
measure
decreeing
a
of
siege
at
the
abyss
soon
after
he
had
begun
to
act
thus
rigorously
the
men
complained
that
no
individual
liberty
was
left
to
them
a
close
watch
was
kept
on
them
on
their
thoughts
and
opinions
as
well
as
on
their
actions
even
outside
the
works
those
who
put
on
a
humble
flattering
manner
and
perchance
became
spies
gained
the
management
good
graces
whilst
the
proud
and
independent
were
treated
as
dangerous
men
and
as
the
manager
was
by
instinct
a
staunch
conservative
a
defender
of
the
existing
order
of
things
and
openly
evinced
the
resolve
to
have
none
but
men
of
his
own
views
in
the
place
all
the
underlings
the
engineers
foremen
and
inspectors
strove
to
surpass
one
another
in
energy
displaying
implacable
severity
with
regard
to
obedience
and
what
they
chose
to
call
proper
spirit
bonnaire
hurt
in
his
opinions
his
craving
for
liberty
and
justice
naturally
found
himself
at
the
head
of
the
malcontents
it
was
he
who
with
a
few
mates
waited
on
delaveau
to
acquaint
him
with
their
complaints
he
spoke
out
very
plainly
and
indeed
exasperated
the
manager
without
obtaining
the
rise
in
wages
that
he
asked
for
delaveau
did
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
a
general
strike
among
his
hands
for
the
metal
workers
do
not
readily
lose
their
tempers
and
for
many
years
there
had
been
no
strike
at
all
at
the
abyss
whereas
among
the
pitmen
of
the
coal
mines
of
brias
strikes
broke
out
continually
when
therefore
contrary
to
delaveau
anticipations
a
general
strike
did
occur
among
his
own
men
when
one
morning
only
two
hundred
out
of
a
thousand
presented
themselves
at
the
works
which
he
had
to
close
his
resentment
was
so
great
that
he
stubbornly
held
to
the
course
he
had
chosen
and
refused
to
make
the
slightest
concession
when
bonnaire
and
a
deputation
of
the
syndicate
ventured
to
go
to
him
he
began
by
turning
them
out
of
doors
he
was
the
master
the
quarrel
was
between
his
workmen
and
himself
and
he
intended
to
settle
it
with
his
workmen
and
with
nobody
else
bonnaire
therefore
returned
to
see
him
accompanied
only
by
three
mates
but
all
that
they
could
obtain
from
him
were
arguments
and
calculations
tending
to
show
that
the
prosperity
of
the
abyss
would
be
compromised
if
he
should
increase
the
men
wages
funds
had
been
confided
to
him
a
factory
had
been
given
him
to
manage
and
it
was
his
duty
to
see
that
the
factory
paid
its
way
and
that
the
funds
yielded
the
promised
rate
of
interest
he
was
certainly
disposed
to
be
humane
but
he
considered
that
it
was
the
duty
of
an
honest
man
to
keep
his
engagements
and
extract
from
the
enterprise
he
directed
the
largest
amount
of
gain
possible
all
the
rest
in
his
opinion
was
visionary
wild
hope
dangerous
utopia
and
thus
each
side
becoming
more
and
more
stubborn
after
several
similar
interviews
the
strike
lasted
for
two
long
months
full
of
disasters
for
the
as
well
as
for
the
owner
increasing
as
it
did
the
misery
of
the
men
whilst
the
plant
was
damaged
by
neglect
and
idleness
at
last
the
contending
parties
consented
to
make
certain
mutual
concessions
and
came
to
an
agreement
respecting
a
new
tariff
but
throughout
another
week
delaveau
refused
to
take
back
certain
workmen
whom
he
called
the
and
among
whom
of
course
was
bonnaire
the
manager
harboured
very
rancorous
feelings
towards
the
latter
although
he
recognised
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
skilful
and
most
sober
of
his
hands
when
he
ultimately
gave
way
and
took
bonnaire
back
with
the
others
he
declared
that
he
was
being
compelled
to
act
in
this
manner
against
his
inclinations
solely
from
a
desire
to
restore
peace
from
that
moment
bonnaire
felt
that
he
was
condemned
under
such
circumstances
he
was
at
first
absolutely
unwilling
to
go
back
to
the
works
at
all
but
he
was
a
great
favourite
with
his
mates
and
when
they
declared
that
they
would
not
return
unless
he
resumed
work
at
the
same
time
as
themselves
he
appeared
to
resign
himself
to
their
wishes
in
order
that
he
might
not
prove
the
cause
of
some
fresh
rupture
in
his
estimation
however
his
mates
had
suffered
quite
enough
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
and
intended
to
sacrifice
himself
in
order
that
none
other
might
have
to
pay
the
penalty
of
the
which
had
been
gained
and
thus
although
he
had
ended
by
returning
to
work
on
the
thursday
it
had
been
with
the
intention
of
taking
himself
off
on
the
ensuing
sunday
for
he
was
convinced
that
his
presence
at
the
abyss
was
no
longer
possible
he
took
none
of
his
friends
into
his
confidence
but
simply
warned
the
management
on
saturday
morning
of
his
intention
to
leave
if
he
were
still
working
at
the
abyss
that
night
it
was
solely
because
he
wished
to
finish
a
job
which
he
had
begun
he
desired
to
disappear
in
a
quiet
honest
way
luc
having
given
his
name
to
the
door
porter
inquired
if
he
could
speak
to
bonnaire
and
the
porter
in
reply
contented
himself
with
pointing
out
the
hall
where
the
and
were
installed
at
the
further
end
of
the
second
yard
on
the
left
the
yards
soaked
by
the
recent
rain
formed
a
perfect
cloaca
what
with
their
uneven
and
their
tangle
of
rails
amongst
which
passed
a
branch
line
connecting
the
works
with
beauclair
railway
station
under
the
brightness
of
a
few
electric
lamps
amongst
the
shadows
cast
by
the
sheds
and
the
plunging
tower
and
the
vaguely
outlined
cementing
furnaces
which
suggested
the
conical
temples
of
some
barbarous
religion
a
little
engine
was
slowly
moving
about
and
sending
forth
shrill
whistles
of
warning
in
order
that
nobody
might
be
run
over
but
what
more
particularly
deafened
the
visitor
from
the
moment
he
crossed
the
threshold
was
the
beating
of
a
couple
of
installed
in
a
kind
of
cellar
their
big
heads
the
heads
it
seemed
of
voracious
beasts
could
be
seen
striking
the
iron
with
a
furious
rhythm
they
bit
it
as
it
were
and
stretched
it
into
bars
with
all
the
force
of
their
desperate
metal
teeth
the
workmen
beside
them
led
calm
and
silent
lives
communicating
with
one
another
by
gestures
only
amidst
the
everlasting
uproar
and
trepidation
luc
after
skirting
a
low
building
where
some
other
were
also
working
ragefully
turned
to
the
left
and
crossed
the
second
yard
whose
ravaged
soil
was
littered
with
pieces
of
scrap
metal
slumbering
in
the
mud
until
collected
for
a
railway
truck
was
being
laden
with
a
large
piece
of
wrought
work
a
shaft
for
a
torpedo
boat
which
had
been
finished
that
very
day
and
which
the
little
engine
was
about
to
remove
as
this
engine
came
up
whistling
luc
in
order
to
avoid
it
took
a
pathway
between
some
symmetrically
disposed
piles
of
and
in
this
wise
reached
the
hall
of
the
and
the
this
hall
or
gallery
one
of
the
largest
of
the
works
resounded
in
the
daytime
with
the
terrible
rumbling
of
the
rollers
but
the
latter
were
now
at
rest
and
more
than
half
of
the
huge
place
was
steeped
in
darkness
of
the
ten
only
four
were
at
work
served
by
two
here
and
there
a
meagre
flickered
in
the
draught
huge
shadows
filled
the
place
one
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
great
smoked
beams
upholding
the
roof
above
a
sound
of
dripping
water
emerged
from
the
darkness
the
beaten
ground
which
served
as
a
flooring
all
bumps
and
hollows
was
in
one
part
so
much
fÅtid
mud
in
another
so
much
in
another
again
a
mass
of
waste
stuff
on
every
side
one
noticed
the
filth
of
joyless
labour
a
labour
hated
and
accursed
performed
in
a
black
ruinous
ignoble
den
pestilential
with
smoke
and
grimy
with
the
dirt
of
every
kind
that
flew
through
the
air
from
the
nails
driven
into
some
little
huts
of
rough
boards
hung
the
workmen
mixed
with
linen
vests
and
leather
aprons
and
all
that
dense
misery
was
only
brightened
when
some
master
puddler
happened
to
open
the
door
of
his
furnace
whence
emerged
a
blinding
flow
of
light
which
like
the
beaming
of
some
planet
transpierced
the
darkness
of
the
entire
gallery
when
luc
presented
himself
bonnaire
was
for
the
last
time
stirring
some
fusing
metal
some
four
hundred
and
forty
pounds
weight
of
cast
iron
which
the
furnace
and
human
labour
between
them
were
to
turn
into
steel
the
whole
operation
of
steel
puddling
required
four
hours
and
this
stirring
at
the
expiration
of
the
first
hours
of
waiting
was
the
hardest
part
of
the
work
grasping
an
iron
rod
of
fifty
pounds
weight
and
standing
in
the
broiling
glare
the
master
puddler
stirred
the
incandescent
metal
on
the
sole
of
the
furnace
with
the
help
of
the
hook
at
the
end
of
his
bar
he
raked
the
depths
and
kneaded
the
huge
ball
or
at
which
he
alone
was
able
to
gaze
with
his
eyes
hardened
to
the
intense
glow
and
he
had
to
gaze
at
it
since
it
was
by
its
colour
that
he
ascertained
what
stage
the
work
had
reached
when
he
withdrew
his
bar
the
latter
was
a
bright
red
and
threw
out
sparks
on
all
sides
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
bonnaire
now
signed
to
his
stoker
to
quicken
the
fire
whilst
another
workman
the
companion
puddler
took
up
a
bar
in
order
to
do
a
stir
in
his
turn
are
monsieur
bonnaire
are
you
not
asked
luc
drawing
near
the
master
puddler
seemed
surprised
at
being
thus
accosted
but
nodded
affirmatively
he
looked
superb
with
his
white
neck
and
pink
face
full
of
victorious
strength
amidst
the
glare
of
his
work
scarcely
years
of
age
he
was
a
giant
of
fair
complexion
with
hair
and
a
broad
massive
placid
face
his
large
firm
mouth
and
big
peaceful
eyes
expressed
great
rectitude
and
kindliness
do
know
if
you
recognise
me
luc
continued
i
saw
you
here
last
summer
and
had
a
talk
with
you
so
the
master
puddler
at
last
replied
are
a
friend
of
monsieur
jordan
when
however
the
young
man
with
some
embarrassment
explained
the
motive
of
his
visit
how
he
had
seen
the
unhappy
josine
cast
into
the
street
and
how
it
seemed
that
he
bonnaire
could
alone
do
something
for
her
the
workman
relapsed
into
silence
looking
embarrassed
on
his
side
also
neither
spoke
for
a
time
there
came
an
interval
of
waiting
prolonged
by
the
noise
of
the
near
them
and
when
the
master
puddler
was
at
last
able
to
make
himself
heard
he
simply
said
right
i
do
what
i
can
i
go
with
you
as
soon
as
finished
in
about
of
an
hour
although
it
was
nearly
eleven
already
luc
resolved
to
wait
and
at
first
he
began
to
take
some
interest
in
a
which
in
a
dark
corner
near
at
hand
was
cutting
with
as
much
quiet
ease
as
if
steel
were
butter
at
each
motion
of
the
machine
jaws
a
little
piece
of
metal
fell
and
a
heap
was
soon
formed
ready
to
be
carried
in
a
barrow
into
the
where
each
charge
of
pounds
weight
was
made
up
in
order
to
be
removed
to
the
adjacent
hall
where
the
crucible
furnaces
were
installed
and
with
the
view
of
occupying
his
time
attracted
as
he
was
by
the
great
pink
glow
which
filled
that
hall
luc
entered
it
it
was
a
very
large
and
lofty
place
as
badly
kept
as
grimy
and
as
much
out
of
repair
as
the
other
and
on
a
level
with
the
bossy
ground
littered
with
scrap
were
the
openings
of
six
batteries
of
furnaces
each
divided
into
three
compartments
those
narrow
long
glaring
pits
whose
brick
walls
occupied
the
whole
basement
were
heated
by
a
mixture
of
air
and
flaming
gas
which
the
head
caster
himself
regulated
by
means
of
a
mechanical
fan
thus
streaking
the
beaten
ground
of
the
shadowy
hall
there
appeared
six
slits
open
above
the
internal
hell
the
volcano
whose
subterranean
brazier
could
be
heard
rumbling
loudly
covers
shaped
like
long
slabs
bricks
bound
together
by
an
iron
armature
were
laid
across
the
furnaces
but
these
covers
did
not
join
and
from
each
intervening
space
sprang
an
intense
pinkish
light
so
many
sunrises
as
it
were
broad
rays
starting
from
the
soil
and
darting
in
a
sheaf
to
the
dusty
glass
of
the
roofing
and
whenever
a
man
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
work
removed
one
or
another
of
the
covers
one
might
have
thought
that
some
planet
was
emerging
from
all
obstacles
for
the
hall
was
then
irradiated
by
a
brightness
like
that
of
aurora
it
so
happened
that
luc
was
able
to
see
the
operations
some
workmen
were
loading
a
furnace
and
he
saw
them
lower
the
crucibles
of
refractory
clay
which
had
previously
been
heated
till
they
were
red
and
then
by
means
of
a
funnel
pour
in
the
charges
pounds
of
metal
for
each
crucible
for
some
three
or
four
hours
fusion
would
be
in
progress
and
then
the
crucibles
would
have
to
be
removed
and
emptied
which
was
the
terrible
part
of
the
work
as
luc
drew
near
to
another
furnace
where
some
men
provided
with
long
bars
had
just
assured
themselves
that
the
fusion
was
perfect
he
recognised
fauchard
in
the
drawer
whose
duty
it
was
to
remove
the
crucibles
livid
and
withered
with
a
bony
scorched
face
fauchard
had
none
the
less
retained
strong
herculean
arms
and
legs
physically
deformed
by
the
terrible
labour
ever
the
same
which
he
had
been
performing
for
fourteen
years
already
he
had
suffered
yet
more
considerably
in
his
intelligence
from
the
life
to
which
he
had
been
condemned
perpetually
repeating
the
same
movements
without
need
of
thought
or
individuality
of
action
becoming
as
it
were
merely
an
element
of
the
struggle
with
fire
his
physical
defects
the
rise
of
his
shoulders
the
hypertrophy
of
his
limbs
the
scorching
of
his
eyes
which
had
paled
from
constant
exposure
to
flaming
light
were
not
his
only
blemishes
he
was
also
conscious
of
intellectual
downfall
for
caught
in
the
monster
grasp
at
sixteen
years
of
age
after
a
rudimentary
education
suddenly
cut
short
he
remembered
that
he
had
once
possessed
intelligence
an
intelligence
which
was
now
flickering
and
departing
under
the
relentless
burden
of
a
labour
which
he
performed
like
some
blinded
beast
crushed
down
by
destructive
baleful
toil
and
he
now
had
but
one
sole
craving
one
sole
delight
which
was
to
drink
to
drink
his
four
quarts
of
wine
at
each
shift
to
drink
so
that
the
furnace
might
not
burn
up
his
baked
skin
like
so
much
old
rind
to
drink
so
that
he
might
escape
crumbling
into
ashes
so
that
he
might
enjoy
some
last
felicity
by
finishing
his
life
in
the
happy
stupor
of
perpetual
intoxication
that
night
fauchard
had
greatly
feared
that
the
fire
would
boil
some
more
of
his
blood
but
already
at
eight
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
natalie
his
wife
arrive
with
the
four
quarts
of
wine
which
she
had
obtained
on
credit
from
caffiaux
and
which
he
had
no
longer
expected
she
expressed
regret
that
she
had
not
a
little
meat
to
give
him
also
but
dacheux
she
said
had
shown
himself
pitiless
ever
in
low
spirits
and
greatly
given
to
complaining
she
expressed
her
anxiety
as
to
how
they
would
manage
to
get
anything
to
eat
on
the
morrow
but
her
husband
who
was
well
pleased
at
having
secured
his
wine
dismissed
her
saying
that
he
should
apply
to
the
manager
for
an
advance
as
his
mates
had
done
a
crust
of
bread
sufficed
him
as
food
he
drank
and
at
once
found
himself
full
of
confidence
when
the
time
to
remove
the
crucibles
arrived
he
tossed
off
another
at
a
gulp
and
went
to
the
water
cistern
to
soak
the
large
linen
apron
that
enveloped
him
then
with
big
wooden
shoes
on
his
feet
and
wet
gloves
on
his
hands
armed
too
with
long
iron
pincers
he
stood
astride
the
furnace
resting
his
right
foot
on
the
cover
which
had
just
been
pushed
aside
his
chest
and
stomach
being
exposed
the
while
to
the
frightful
heat
which
arose
from
the
open
volcano
for
a
moment
he
appeared
quite
red
blazing
like
a
torch
in
the
midst
of
a
brazier
his
wooden
shoes
steamed
his
apron
and
his
gloves
steamed
the
whole
of
his
flesh
seemed
to
melt
away
but
without
evincing
any
haste
he
looked
below
him
his
eyes
accustomed
to
the
brightest
glare
sought
the
crucible
in
the
depths
of
the
burning
pit
then
he
stooped
slightly
in
order
to
seize
it
with
his
long
pincers
and
with
a
sudden
straightening
of
the
loins
with
three
supple
rhythmical
movements
one
of
his
hands
opening
and
gliding
along
the
rod
until
the
other
joined
it
he
drew
up
the
crucible
raising
easily
at
arm
length
that
weight
of
one
hundred
and
ten
pounds
pincers
and
crucible
combined
and
deposited
it
on
the
ground
where
it
looked
like
some
piece
of
the
sun
at
first
of
dazzling
whiteness
which
speedily
changed
to
pink
then
he
began
the
operation
afresh
drawing
the
crucibles
forth
one
by
one
amidst
the
increasing
glow
with
more
skill
even
than
strength
coming
and
going
amidst
that
incandescent
matter
without
ever
burning
himself
without
seeming
even
to
feel
the
intolerable
heat
they
were
going
to
cast
some
little
shells
of
one
hundred
and
pounds
the
moulds
were
ranged
in
two
rows
and
when
the
assistants
had
skimmed
the
slag
off
the
crucibles
with
the
aid
of
iron
rods
which
came
away
smoking
and
dropping
purple
slaver
the
head
caster
quickly
seized
the
crucibles
with
his
large
pincers
and
emptied
two
into
each
mould
and
the
metal
flowed
like
white
lava
with
just
a
faint
pinkish
tinge
here
and
there
amidst
a
shooting
of
fine
blue
sparks
as
delicate
as
flowers
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
man
was
decanting
some
bright
liqueur
all
was
done
noiselessly
with
precise
and
nimble
movements
amidst
a
blaze
and
a
heat
that
changed
the
whole
place
into
a
devouring
brazier
luc
who
was
unaccustomed
to
it
all
felt
stifling
unable
to
remain
there
any
longer
at
a
distance
of
twelve
and
even
fifteen
feet
from
the
furnaces
his
face
was
scorched
and
a
burning
perspiration
streamed
from
him
the
shells
had
interested
him
and
he
watched
them
cooling
asking
himself
what
men
they
would
some
day
kill
and
going
on
into
the
next
hall
he
there
found
himself
among
the
steam
hammers
and
the
this
hall
was
now
asleep
with
all
its
monstrous
appliances
its
press
of
a
force
of
two
thousand
tons
and
its
hammers
of
lesser
power
spread
out
showing
in
the
depths
of
the
gloom
their
black
squat
silhouettes
which
suggested
those
of
barbarian
gods
and
here
luc
found
more
projectiles
shells
which
that
very
day
had
been
forged
under
the
smallest
on
leaving
the
moulds
after
annealing
then
he
became
interested
in
the
tube
of
a
large
naval
gun
more
than
nineteen
feet
long
which
was
still
warm
from
having
passed
under
the
press
billets
totalling
two
thousand
two
hundred
pounds
of
steel
had
spread
out
and
adapted
themselves
like
rolls
of
paste
to
form
that
tube
which
was
waiting
chained
ready
to
be
lifted
by
powerful
cranes
and
carried
to
the
which
were
farther
off
beyond
the
hall
where
the
martin
furnace
and
some
of
the
plant
were
installed
luc
went
on
to
the
end
across
that
hall
also
the
most
spacious
of
them
all
for
there
the
largest
pieces
were
cast
the
martin
furnace
enabled
one
to
pour
large
quantities
of
steel
in
a
state
of
fusion
into
the
moulds
whilst
eight
feet
overhead
two
rolling
bridges
worked
by
electricity
gently
and
easily
moved
huge
pieces
weighing
many
tons
to
every
requisite
point
then
luc
entered
the
lathe
workshop
a
huge
closed
shed
which
was
rather
better
kept
than
the
others
and
where
on
either
hand
he
found
a
series
of
admirable
appliances
in
which
incomparable
delicacy
and
power
were
blended
there
were
planes
for
naval
which
finished
off
even
as
a
plane
gives
a
finish
to
wood
and
there
were
the
lathes
of
precise
if
intricate
mechanism
as
pretty
as
jewels
and
as
amusing
as
toys
only
some
of
them
worked
at
each
lighted
by
a
single
electric
lamp
and
giving
forth
but
a
faint
sound
in
the
deep
silence
again
did
luc
come
upon
projectiles
there
was
one
shell
which
had
been
fixed
to
a
lathe
to
be
calibrated
externally
it
turned
round
and
round
with
a
prodigious
speed
and
steel
shavings
which
suggested
silver
curls
flew
away
from
under
the
narrow
motionless
blade
afterwards
it
would
only
have
to
be
hollowed
internally
tempered
and
finished
but
where
were
the
men
that
would
be
killed
by
it
after
it
had
been
charged
as
the
outcome
of
all
that
heroic
human
labour
the
subjugation
of
iron
bringing
royalty
to
man
and
victory
over
the
forces
of
nature
luc
beheld
a
vision
of
massacre
all
the
bloodthirsty
madness
of
a
he
walked
on
and
at
a
little
distance
came
upon
a
large
lathe
where
a
cannon
similar
to
the
one
whose
forged
tube
he
had
just
seen
was
revolving
this
one
however
was
already
calibrated
externally
and
shone
like
new
money
under
the
supervision
of
a
youth
who
leant
forward
attentively
watching
the
mechanism
like
a
that
of
a
watch
it
turned
and
turned
interminably
with
a
gentle
humming
whilst
the
blade
inside
drilled
it
with
marvellous
precision
and
when
that
gun
also
should
have
been
tempered
cast
from
the
summit
of
the
tower
into
a
bath
of
petroleum
oil
to
what
would
it
journey
to
kill
men
how
many
lives
would
it
mow
down
that
gun
made
of
steel
which
men
in
a
spirit
of
brotherliness
should
have
fashioned
only
into
rails
and
ploughshares
luc
pushed
a
door
open
and
made
his
escape
into
the
open
air
the
night
was
damply
warm
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
feeling
refreshed
by
the
wind
which
was
blowing
when
he
raised
his
eyes
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
a
single
star
beyond
the
wild
rush
of
the
clouds
but
the
lamp
globes
shining
here
and
there
in
the
yard
replaced
the
hidden
moon
and
again
he
saw
the
chimneys
rising
amidst
lurid
smoke
and
a
sky
across
which
upon
every
side
forming
as
it
were
some
gigantic
cobweb
flew
all
the
wires
which
transmitted
electric
power
the
machines
which
produced
it
two
machines
of
great
beauty
were
working
close
by
in
some
new
buildings
there
were
also
some
works
for
making
bricks
and
crucibles
of
refractory
clay
there
was
a
carpenter
shop
for
and
packing
and
numerous
warehouses
for
commercial
steel
and
iron
and
luc
after
losing
himself
for
a
time
in
that
little
town
well
pleased
when
he
came
upon
deserted
stretches
black
peaceful
nooks
where
he
seemed
to
revive
to
life
suddenly
found
himself
once
more
inside
the
inferno
on
looking
around
him
he
perceived
that
he
was
again
in
the
gallery
containing
the
furnaces
for
the
crucibles
another
operation
was
now
being
executed
there
seventy
crucibles
were
being
removed
at
the
same
moment
for
some
big
piece
of
casting
which
was
to
weigh
over
three
thousand
nine
hundred
pounds
the
mould
with
its
funnel
was
waiting
in
readiness
in
the
pit
in
the
neighbouring
hall
and
the
procession
was
swiftly
organised
all
the
helpers
of
the
various
squads
took
part
in
it
two
men
for
each
crucible
which
they
raised
with
pincers
and
carried
off
with
long
and
easy
strides
another
then
another
then
another
the
whole
seventy
crucibles
passed
along
in
a
dazzling
procession
one
might
have
thought
it
some
ballet
scene
in
which
vague
dancers
with
light
and
shadowy
feet
passed
carrying
huge
venetian
lanterns
in
hue
and
the
marvellous
part
of
it
all
was
the
extraordinary
rapidity
the
perfect
assurance
of
the
movements
in
which
the
bearers
were
seen
gambolling
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
fire
hastening
up
elbowing
one
another
marching
off
and
coming
back
juggling
all
the
while
with
fusing
stars
in
less
than
three
minutes
the
seventy
crucibles
were
emptied
into
the
mould
whence
arose
a
sheaf
of
gold
a
great
spreading
bouquet
of
sparks
when
luc
at
last
returned
to
the
hall
containing
the
puddling
furnaces
and
the
rollers
after
a
good
promenade
he
found
bonnaire
finishing
his
work
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
monsieur
said
the
puddler
on
the
glaring
sole
of
the
furnace
whose
open
door
was
blazing
he
had
already
on
three
occasions
isolated
one
quarter
of
the
incandescent
metal
that
is
a
hundredweight
of
it
which
he
had
rolled
and
fashioned
into
a
kind
of
ball
with
the
aid
of
his
bar
and
those
three
quarters
had
gone
one
after
the
other
to
the
hammer
he
was
now
dealing
with
the
fourth
and
last
portion
for
twenty
minutes
he
had
been
standing
before
that
voracious
maw
his
chest
almost
crackling
from
the
heat
of
the
furnace
his
hands
manipulating
his
heavy
hooked
bar
and
his
eyes
clearly
seeing
how
to
do
the
work
aright
in
spite
of
all
the
dazzling
flames
he
gazed
fixedly
at
the
fiery
ball
of
steel
which
he
rolled
over
and
over
continuously
in
the
centre
of
the
brazier
and
in
the
fierce
reverberation
which
gilded
his
tall
pinkish
form
against
the
black
background
of
darkness
he
looked
like
some
maker
of
planets
busily
creating
new
worlds
but
at
last
he
finished
withdrew
his
flaming
bar
and
handed
over
to
his
mate
the
last
hundredweight
of
the
charge
the
stoker
was
in
readiness
with
a
little
iron
chariot
armed
with
his
pincers
the
assistant
puddler
seized
hold
of
the
ball
which
suggested
some
huge
fiery
sponge
that
had
sprouted
on
the
side
of
a
volcanic
cavern
and
with
an
effort
he
brought
it
out
and
threw
it
into
the
chariot
which
the
stoker
quickly
wheeled
to
the
hammer
a
smith
at
once
caught
it
with
his
own
pincers
and
placed
and
turned
it
over
under
the
hammer
which
all
at
once
began
working
then
came
a
deafening
noise
and
a
perfect
dazzlement
the
ground
quaked
a
pealing
of
bells
seemed
to
ring
out
whilst
the
smith
gloved
and
bound
round
with
leather
disappeared
amidst
a
perfect
tornado
of
sparks
at
some
moments
the
expectorations
were
so
large
that
they
burst
here
and
there
like
canister
shot
impassive
amidst
that
fusillade
the
smith
turned
the
sponge
over
and
over
in
order
that
it
might
be
struck
on
every
side
and
converted
into
a
a
loaf
of
steel
ready
for
the
rollers
and
the
hammer
obeyed
him
struck
here
struck
there
slackening
or
hastening
its
blows
without
a
word
even
coming
from
his
lips
without
anyone
even
detecting
the
signs
which
he
made
to
the
who
sat
aloft
in
his
little
box
with
his
hand
on
the
luc
who
had
drawn
near
whilst
bonnaire
was
changing
his
clothes
recognised
little
fortunÃ©
fauchard
in
the
thus
perched
on
high
motionless
for
hours
together
giving
no
other
sign
of
life
than
a
little
mechanical
gesture
of
the
hand
amidst
the
deafening
uproar
which
he
raised
a
touch
on
the
lever
so
that
the
hammer
might
fall
a
touch
on
the
lever
so
that
it
might
rise
that
was
all
the
little
lad
mind
was
confined
to
that
narrow
space
by
the
bright
gleams
of
the
sparks
one
could
for
a
moment
perceive
him
slim
and
frail
with
an
ashen
face
discoloured
hair
and
the
blurred
eyes
of
a
poor
little
being
whose
growth
both
physically
and
mentally
had
been
arrested
by
brutish
work
in
which
there
was
nothing
to
attract
one
in
which
there
was
never
a
chance
of
any
initiative
monsieur
willing
i
ready
now
said
bonnaire
just
as
the
hammer
at
last
became
silent
luc
quickly
turned
round
and
found
the
master
puddler
before
him
wearing
a
jersey
and
a
coarse
woollen
jacket
whilst
under
one
of
his
arms
was
a
bundle
made
up
of
his
and
certain
small
articles
belonging
to
him
all
his
baggage
in
fact
since
he
was
leaving
the
works
to
return
to
them
no
more
so
let
us
be
off
said
luc
but
bonnaire
paused
for
another
moment
as
if
he
fancied
that
he
might
have
forgotten
something
he
gave
a
last
glance
inside
the
plank
hut
which
served
as
a
cloakroom
then
he
looked
at
his
furnace
the
furnace
which
he
had
made
his
own
by
more
than
ten
years
of
hard
toil
turning
out
there
thousands
of
pounds
of
steel
fit
for
the
rollers
he
was
leaving
the
establishment
of
his
own
free
will
in
the
idea
that
such
was
his
duty
towards
both
his
mates
and
himself
but
for
that
very
reason
the
severance
was
the
more
heroic
however
he
forced
back
the
emotion
which
was
clutching
him
at
the
throat
and
passed
out
the
first
in
advance
of
luc
care
monsieur
he
said
piece
is
still
warm
it
would
burn
your
boot
neither
spoke
any
further
they
crossed
the
two
dim
yards
under
the
lunar
lights
and
passed
before
the
low
building
where
the
were
beating
ragefully
and
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
the
abyss
the
black
night
seized
hold
of
them
again
and
the
glow
and
growl
of
the
monster
died
away
behind
them
the
wind
was
still
blowing
a
wind
carrying
the
ragged
flight
of
clouds
skyward
and
across
the
bridge
the
bank
of
the
mionne
was
deserted
not
a
soul
was
visible
when
luc
had
found
josine
reclining
on
the
bench
where
he
had
left
her
motionless
and
staring
into
the
darkness
with
nanet
asleep
and
pressing
his
head
against
her
he
wished
to
withdraw
for
he
considered
his
mission
ended
since
bonnaire
would
now
find
the
poor
creature
some
place
of
shelter
but
the
puddler
suddenly
became
embarrassed
and
anxious
at
the
idea
of
the
scene
which
would
follow
his
homecoming
when
his
wife
that
terrible
toupe
should
see
him
accompanying
that
hussy
the
scene
was
bound
to
be
the
more
frightful
since
he
had
not
told
his
wife
of
his
intention
to
quit
the
works
he
foresaw
indeed
that
a
tremendous
quarrel
would
break
out
when
she
learnt
that
he
was
without
work
through
throwing
himself
voluntarily
out
of
employment
i
accompany
you
luc
suggested
might
be
able
to
explain
things
my
word
monsieur
replied
the
other
feeling
relieved
would
perhaps
be
the
better
if
you
did
no
words
passed
between
bonnaire
and
josine
she
seemed
ashamed
in
presence
of
the
master
puddler
and
if
he
with
his
good
nature
knowing
too
all
that
she
suffered
with
ragu
evinced
a
kind
of
fatherly
pity
towards
her
he
none
the
less
blamed
her
for
having
yielded
to
that
bad
fellow
josine
had
awakened
nanet
on
seeing
the
two
men
arrive
and
after
an
encouraging
sign
from
luc
she
and
the
boy
followed
them
in
silence
all
four
turned
to
the
right
skirting
the
railway
embankment
and
thus
entering
old
beauclair
whose
hovels
spread
like
some
horrid
stagnant
pool
over
the
flat
ground
just
at
the
opening
of
the
gorge
there
was
an
intricate
maze
of
narrow
streets
and
lanes
lacking
both
air
and
light
and
infected
by
filthy
gutters
which
the
more
torrential
rains
alone
cleansed
the
overcrowding
of
the
wretched
populace
in
so
small
a
space
was
hard
to
understand
when
in
front
of
it
one
perceived
la
roumagne
spreading
its
immense
plain
where
the
breath
of
heaven
blew
freely
as
over
the
sea
the
bitter
keenness
of
the
battle
for
money
and
property
alone
accounted
for
the
niggardly
fashion
in
which
the
right
of
the
inhabitants
to
some
little
portion
of
the
soil
the
few
yards
requisite
for
everyday
life
had
been
granted
speculators
had
taken
a
hand
in
it
all
and
one
or
two
centuries
of
wretchedness
had
culminated
in
a
cloaca
of
cheap
lodgings
whence
people
were
frequently
expelled
by
their
landlords
low
as
might
be
the
rents
demanded
for
certain
of
those
dens
where
people
would
not
have
allowed
even
their
dogs
to
sleep
over
the
ground
had
risen
those
little
dark
houses
those
damp
shanties
of
those
vermin
and
nests
and
mournful
indeed
at
that
night
hour
under
the
lugubrious
sky
appeared
that
accursed
city
of
labour
so
dim
so
filthy
too
like
some
horrid
vegetation
of
social
injustice
bonnaire
walking
ahead
followed
a
lane
then
turned
into
another
and
at
last
reached
the
rue
des
trois
lunes
one
of
the
narrowest
of
the
streets
it
had
no
footways
and
was
paved
with
pointed
pebbles
picked
from
the
bed
of
the
mionne
the
black
and
creviced
house
of
which
he
occupied
the
first
floor
had
one
day
suddenly
lurching
in
such
wise
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
shore
up
the
frontage
with
four
great
beams
and
ragu
as
it
happened
occupied
the
two
rooms
of
the
second
story
whose
sloping
floor
those
beams
supported
down
below
there
was
no
hall
the
precipitous
stairs
started
from
the
very
threshold
so
monsieur
bonnaire
at
last
said
to
luc
will
be
kind
enough
to
come
up
with
me
he
had
once
more
become
embarrassed
josine
understood
that
he
did
not
dare
take
her
to
his
rooms
for
fear
of
some
affront
though
he
suffered
at
having
to
leave
her
still
in
the
street
with
the
child
in
her
gentle
resigned
way
she
therefore
arranged
matters
need
not
go
in
she
said
wait
on
the
stairs
up
above
bonnaire
immediately
fell
in
with
the
suggestion
best
said
he
a
little
patience
sit
down
a
moment
and
if
the
key
in
my
place
i
bring
it
to
you
and
then
you
can
go
to
bed
josine
and
nanet
had
already
disappeared
into
the
dense
darkness
enveloping
the
stairs
one
could
no
longer
even
hear
them
breathing
they
had
ensconced
themselves
in
some
nook
overhead
and
bonnaire
in
his
turn
then
went
up
guiding
luc
warning
him
respecting
the
height
of
the
steps
and
telling
him
to
keep
hold
of
the
greasy
rope
which
served
in
lieu
of
a
monsieur
that
it
do
move
he
said
at
last
the
landings
are
large
and
one
would
turn
a
fine
somersault
if
one
were
to
fall
he
opened
a
door
and
politely
made
luc
pass
before
him
into
a
fairly
spacious
room
where
a
little
petroleum
lamp
shed
a
yellowish
light
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
la
toupe
was
still
mending
some
house
linen
beside
this
lamp
whilst
her
father
daddy
lunot
as
he
was
called
had
fallen
asleep
in
a
shadowy
nook
with
his
pipe
which
had
gone
out
between
his
gums
in
a
bed
standing
in
one
corner
slept
the
two
children
lucien
and
antoinette
one
six
the
other
four
years
old
and
both
of
them
fine
big
children
for
their
respective
ages
apart
from
this
common
room
where
the
family
cooked
and
ate
their
meals
the
lodging
only
comprised
two
others
the
of
the
husband
and
wife
and
that
of
daddy
lunot
la
toupe
stupefied
at
seeing
her
husband
return
at
that
hour
for
she
had
been
warned
of
nothing
raised
her
head
exclaiming
is
it
you
he
did
not
wish
to
start
the
great
quarrel
by
immediately
telling
her
that
he
had
left
the
abyss
he
preferred
to
settle
the
matter
of
josine
and
nanet
first
of
all
so
he
replied
evasively
i
finished
so
i
come
back
then
without
leaving
his
wife
time
to
ask
any
more
questions
he
introduced
luc
saying
this
gentleman
who
is
a
friend
of
monsieur
jordan
came
to
ask
me
something
he
explain
it
to
you
her
surprise
and
suspicion
increasing
la
toupe
turned
towards
the
young
man
who
thereby
perceived
her
great
likeness
to
her
brother
ragu
short
and
choleric
she
had
his
strongly
marked
face
with
thick
ruddy
hair
a
low
forehead
thin
nose
and
massive
jaws
her
bright
complexion
the
freshness
of
which
still
rendered
her
attractive
and
at
years
of
age
alone
explained
the
reason
which
had
induced
bonnaire
to
marry
her
though
he
had
been
well
acquainted
with
her
abominable
temper
that
which
everybody
had
then
foreseen
had
come
to
pass
la
toupe
made
the
home
wretched
by
her
everlasting
fits
of
anger
in
order
to
secure
some
peace
her
husband
had
to
bow
to
her
will
in
every
little
matter
of
their
daily
life
very
coquettish
consumed
by
the
ambition
to
be
and
possess
jewellery
she
only
evinced
a
little
gentleness
when
she
was
able
to
deck
herself
in
a
new
gown
luc
being
thus
called
upon
to
speak
felt
the
necessity
of
gaining
her
good
will
by
a
compliment
from
the
moment
of
crossing
the
threshold
however
bare
might
be
the
scanty
furniture
he
had
remarked
that
the
room
seemed
very
clean
thanks
undoubtedly
to
the
carefulness
and
drawing
near
to
the
bed
he
exclaimed
what
fine
children
they
are
sleeping
like
little
angels
la
toupe
smiled
but
looked
at
him
fixedly
and
waited
feeling
thoroughly
convinced
that
this
gentleman
would
not
have
put
himself
out
to
call
there
if
he
had
not
had
something
of
importance
to
obtain
from
her
and
when
he
found
himself
obliged
to
come
to
the
point
when
he
related
how
he
had
found
josine
starving
on
a
bench
abandoned
there
in
the
night
she
made
a
passionate
gesture
and
her
jaws
tightened
without
even
answering
the
gentleman
she
turned
toward
her
husband
in
a
fury
what
this
again
is
it
any
concern
of
mine
bonnaire
thus
compelled
to
intervene
strove
to
pacify
her
in
his
kindly
conciliatory
way
the
same
said
he
ragu
left
the
key
with
you
one
ought
to
give
it
to
the
poor
creature
because
he
over
yonder
at
place
and
may
well
pass
the
night
there
one
ca
leave
a
woman
and
a
child
to
sleep
out
of
doors
at
this
la
toupe
exploded
i
got
the
key
said
she
ragu
gave
it
to
me
and
precisely
because
he
wanted
to
prevent
that
hussy
from
installing
herself
any
more
in
his
rooms
with
her
little
scamp
of
a
brother
but
i
do
want
to
know
anything
about
those
horrors
i
only
know
one
thing
it
was
ragu
who
confided
the
key
to
me
and
it
to
ragu
that
i
shall
return
it
then
as
her
husband
again
attempted
to
move
her
to
pity
she
violently
silenced
him
you
want
to
make
me
take
up
with
my
brother
fancies
then
she
cried
let
the
girl
go
and
kick
the
bucket
elsewhere
since
she
chose
to
listen
to
him
a
nice
state
of
things
it
been
and
no
mistake
no
no
each
for
himself
or
herself
and
as
for
her
let
her
remain
in
the
gutter
a
little
sooner
a
little
later
it
all
amounts
to
the
same
thing
luc
listened
feeling
hurt
and
indignant
in
her
he
found
all
the
harshness
of
the
virtuous
women
of
her
class
who
show
themselves
pitiless
towards
the
girls
that
stumble
amidst
their
trying
struggle
for
life
and
in
la
toupe
case
ever
since
the
day
when
she
had
learnt
that
her
brother
had
bought
josine
a
little
silver
ring
there
had
been
covert
jealousy
and
hatred
of
that
pretty
girl
whom
she
pictured
fascinating
men
and
wheedling
gold
chains
and
silk
gowns
out
of
them
ought
to
be
madame
was
all
that
luc
could
say
in
a
voice
that
quivered
with
compassion
but
la
toupe
did
not
have
time
to
answer
for
all
at
once
an
uproar
of
heavy
stumbling
footsteps
resounded
on
the
stairs
and
hands
fumbled
at
the
knob
of
the
door
which
opened
it
was
ragu
with
bourron
one
following
the
other
like
a
pair
of
drunkards
who
having
wetted
their
whistles
in
company
could
no
longer
separate
nevertheless
ragu
who
had
some
sense
left
him
had
torn
himself
away
from
caffiaux
saying
that
however
pleasant
it
might
be
there
he
none
the
less
had
to
go
back
to
work
on
the
morrow
and
thus
he
had
looked
in
at
his
sister
with
his
mate
in
order
to
get
his
key
key
cried
la
toupe
sharply
it
is
and
i
wo
keep
it
again
mind
i
just
had
a
lot
of
foolish
things
said
to
me
in
order
to
make
me
give
it
to
that
gadabout
another
time
when
you
want
to
turn
somebody
out
of
the
house
just
do
it
yourself
ragu
whose
heart
had
doubtless
been
softened
by
liquor
began
to
laugh
so
stupid
is
josine
he
said
she
had
wanted
to
be
pleasant
she
would
have
drunk
a
glass
with
us
instead
of
snivelling
but
women
never
know
how
to
tackle
men
he
was
unable
to
express
himself
more
fully
for
just
then
bourron
who
had
fallen
on
a
chair
laughing
at
nothing
with
his
everlasting
good
humour
inquired
of
bonnaire
say
is
it
true
then
that
leaving
the
works
la
toupe
turned
round
starting
as
if
a
pistol
had
been
fired
off
behind
her
he
leaving
the
works
she
cried
silence
fell
then
bonnaire
courageously
came
to
a
decision
leaving
the
works
i
ca
do
otherwise
leaving
the
works
you
leaving
the
works
bawled
his
wife
quite
furious
and
distracted
as
she
took
her
stand
before
him
that
two
months
strike
which
made
us
spend
all
our
savings
enough
eh
it
for
you
to
pay
the
piper
now
eh
so
we
shall
die
of
starvation
and
i
shall
have
to
go
about
naked
he
did
not
lose
his
temper
but
gently
answered
quite
possible
that
you
wo
have
a
new
gown
for
new
year
day
and
perhaps
too
we
shall
have
to
go
on
short
commons
but
i
repeat
to
you
that
i
doing
what
i
ought
to
do
she
did
not
give
up
the
battle
as
yet
but
drew
still
nearer
shouting
in
his
face
bunkum
you
need
imagine
that
folks
will
be
grateful
to
you
your
mates
do
scruple
to
say
that
if
it
had
been
for
that
strike
of
yours
they
never
have
starved
during
those
two
months
do
you
know
what
they
say
when
they
hear
that
you
left
the
works
they
say
that
it
serves
you
right
and
that
you
only
an
idiot
i
never
allow
you
to
do
such
a
foolish
thing
you
hear
you
go
back
bonnaire
looked
at
her
fixedly
with
his
bright
and
steady
eyes
if
as
a
rule
he
gave
way
on
points
of
domestic
policy
if
he
allowed
her
to
reign
despotically
in
ordinary
household
matters
he
became
like
iron
whenever
any
case
of
conscience
arose
and
so
without
raising
his
voice
in
a
firm
tone
which
she
well
knew
he
answered
will
please
keep
quiet
those
are
matters
for
us
men
women
like
you
understand
anything
about
them
and
so
it
better
that
they
meddle
with
them
you
very
nice
but
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
on
mending
your
linen
again
if
you
do
want
a
quarrel
he
thereupon
pushed
her
towards
the
chair
near
the
lamp
and
forced
her
to
sit
down
again
conquered
trembling
with
wrath
which
she
knew
would
henceforth
be
futile
she
took
up
her
needle
and
made
a
pretence
of
feeling
no
further
interest
in
the
questions
from
which
she
had
been
so
decisively
thrust
aside
awakened
by
the
noise
of
voices
daddy
lunot
her
father
without
evincing
any
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
so
many
people
lighted
his
pipe
once
more
and
listened
to
the
talk
with
the
air
of
an
old
philosopher
who
had
lost
every
illusion
whilst
in
their
little
bed
the
children
lucien
and
antoinette
likewise
roused
from
their
slumber
opened
their
eyes
widely
and
seemed
to
be
striving
to
understand
the
serious
things
which
the
big
folk
were
saying
bonnaire
was
now
addressing
himself
to
luc
as
if
to
invoke
his
testimony
has
his
honour
is
that
not
so
monsieur
the
strike
was
inevitable
and
if
it
had
to
be
begun
over
again
i
should
begin
it
over
again
that
is
i
should
employ
my
influence
in
urging
my
mates
to
try
to
secure
justice
one
ca
let
oneself
be
devoured
work
ought
to
be
paid
at
its
proper
price
unless
men
are
willing
to
become
mere
slaves
and
we
were
so
much
in
the
right
that
monsieur
delaveau
had
to
give
way
on
every
point
by
accepting
our
new
wage
tariff
but
i
can
now
see
that
he
is
furious
and
that
somebody
as
my
wife
puts
it
has
got
to
pay
for
the
damage
if
i
were
not
to
go
off
willingly
find
a
pretext
for
turning
me
out
so
what
am
i
to
hang
on
obstinately
and
become
a
pretext
for
everlasting
disputes
no
no
it
would
all
fall
on
my
mates
it
would
bring
them
all
sorts
of
worries
and
it
would
be
very
wrong
of
me
i
pretended
to
go
back
because
my
mates
talked
of
continuing
the
strike
if
i
did
but
now
that
they
are
all
back
at
work
and
quite
quiet
i
prefer
to
take
myself
off
that
will
settle
everything
none
of
them
will
stir
and
i
shall
have
done
what
i
ought
to
do
that
my
view
of
honour
monsieur
each
has
his
own
he
said
all
this
with
simple
grandeur
with
so
easy
and
courageous
an
air
that
luc
felt
deeply
touched
from
that
man
whom
he
had
seen
black
and
taciturn
toiling
so
painfully
before
his
furnace
from
that
man
whom
he
had
seen
gentle
and
kindly
tolerant
and
conciliatory
in
household
matters
there
now
arose
one
of
the
heroes
of
labour
one
of
those
obscure
strugglers
who
have
given
their
whole
being
to
the
cause
of
justice
and
who
carry
their
brotherliness
to
the
point
of
immolating
themselves
in
silence
for
the
sake
of
others
without
ceasing
to
draw
her
needle
la
toupe
meanwhile
repeated
violently
we
shall
starve
we
shall
starve
it
quite
possible
said
bonnaire
i
shall
be
able
to
sleep
in
peace
ragu
began
to
sneer
starve
that
useless
that
never
done
any
good
not
that
i
defend
the
masters
a
pretty
gang
they
are
all
of
them
only
as
we
need
them
we
always
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
them
and
do
pretty
well
as
they
want
he
rattled
on
jesting
and
revealing
his
true
nature
he
was
the
average
workman
neither
good
nor
bad
the
spoilt
product
of
the
wage
system
he
cried
out
at
times
against
capitalist
rule
he
was
enraged
by
the
strain
of
the
labour
imposed
on
him
and
was
even
capable
of
a
short
rebellion
but
prolonged
atavism
had
bent
him
he
really
had
the
soul
of
a
slave
respecting
established
traditions
and
envying
the
employer
that
sovereign
master
who
possessed
and
enjoyed
everything
and
the
only
covert
ambition
that
he
nourished
was
that
of
taking
the
employer
place
some
fine
morning
in
order
to
possess
and
enjoy
life
in
his
turn
briefly
his
ideal
was
to
do
nothing
to
be
the
master
so
that
he
might
have
nothing
to
do
that
pig
delaveau
he
said
should
like
to
be
just
a
week
in
his
skin
and
to
see
him
in
mine
it
would
amuse
me
to
see
him
smoking
one
of
those
big
cigars
of
his
while
making
a
ball
but
everything
happens
you
know
and
we
may
all
become
masters
in
the
next
this
idea
amused
bourron
vastly
he
gaped
with
admiration
before
ragu
whenever
they
had
drunk
together
true
ah
dash
it
what
a
spree
it
will
be
when
we
become
the
masters
but
bonnaire
shrugged
his
shoulders
full
of
contempt
for
that
base
conception
of
the
future
victory
of
the
toilers
over
their
exploiters
he
had
read
reflected
and
he
thought
he
knew
excited
by
all
that
had
just
been
said
wishing
to
show
that
he
was
right
he
again
spoke
in
his
words
luc
recognised
the
collectivist
idea
such
as
it
is
formulated
by
the
irreconcilable
ones
of
the
party
first
of
all
the
nation
had
to
resume
possession
of
the
soil
and
all
instruments
of
labour
in
order
to
socialise
and
restore
them
to
one
and
all
then
labour
would
be
reorganised
rendered
general
and
compulsory
in
such
wise
that
remuneration
would
be
proportionate
to
the
hours
of
toil
which
each
man
supplied
the
matter
on
which
bonnaire
grew
muddled
was
the
practical
method
to
employ
in
order
to
establish
this
socialisation
and
particularly
the
working
of
it
when
it
should
be
put
into
practice
for
such
intricate
machinery
would
need
direction
and
control
a
harsh
and
vexatory
state
police
system
and
when
luc
who
did
not
yet
go
so
far
as
bonnaire
did
in
his
humanitarian
cravings
offered
some
objections
the
other
replied
with
the
quiet
faith
of
a
believer
belongs
to
us
we
shall
take
everything
back
so
that
each
may
have
his
just
share
of
work
and
rest
trouble
and
joy
there
is
no
other
reasonable
solution
the
injustice
and
the
sufferings
of
the
world
have
become
too
great
even
ragu
and
bourron
agreed
with
this
had
not
the
corrupted
and
poisoned
everything
it
was
that
which
disseminated
anger
and
hatred
gave
rise
to
class
warfare
the
long
war
of
extermination
which
capital
and
labour
were
waging
it
was
by
the
that
man
had
become
wolfish
towards
man
amidst
the
conflict
of
egotism
the
monstrous
tyranny
of
a
social
system
based
on
iniquity
misery
had
no
other
cause
the
was
the
evil
ferment
which
engendered
hunger
with
all
its
disastrous
consequences
theft
murder
prostitution
the
downfall
and
rebellion
of
men
and
women
cast
beyond
the
pale
of
love
thrown
like
perverse
destructive
forces
athwart
society
and
there
was
only
one
remedy
the

secret

from
that
point
began
the
battle
of
the
systems
each
man
thinking
that
in
his
own
system
rested
the
happiness
of
the
coming
centuries
and
a
bitter
political
resulted
from
the
clashing
of
the
socialist
parties
each
of
which
sought
to
impose
on
the
others
its
own
plans
for
the
reorganisation
of
labour
and
the
equitable
distribution
of
wealth
but
none
the
less
the
in
its
present
form
was
condemned
by
one
and
all
and
nothing
could
save
it
it
had
served
its
time
and
it
would
disappear
even
as
slavery
once
so
universal
had
disappeared
when
one
of
the
periods
of
mankind
history
had
ended
by
reason
of
the
onward
march
that
even
now
was
but
a
dead
organ
which
threatened
to
poison
the
whole
body
and
which
the
life
of
nations
must
necessarily
eliminate
under
penalty
of
coming
to
a
tragic
end
instance
bonnaire
continued
qurignons
who
founded
the
abyss
were
not
people
the
last
one
michel
who
came
to
so
sad
an
end
tried
to
ameliorate
the
workman
lot
it
is
to
him
one
owes
the
creation
of
a
pension
fund
for
which
he
gave
the
first
hundred
thousand
francs
engaging
also
to
double
every
year
such
sums
as
were
paid
in
by
the
subscribers
he
also
established
a
free
library
a
a
dispensary
where
one
can
see
the
doctor
gratis
twice
a
week
a
workshop
too
and
a
school
for
the
children
and
though
monsieur
delaveau
is
at
all
so
well
disposed
towards
the
men
he
has
naturally
been
obliged
to
respect
all
that
it
has
been
working
for
years
now
but
when
all
is
said
it
of
no
good
at
all
it
mere
charity
it
is
justice
it
may
go
on
working
for
years
and
years
without
starvation
and
misery
being
any
the
less
no
no
the
people
who
talk
of
relieving
distress
are
simply
fools
no
relief
possible
the
evil
has
to
be
cut
off
at
the
root
at
this
moment
old
lunot
whom
the
others
thought
asleep
again
spoke
from
out
of
the
shadows
knew
the
qurignons
said
he
luc
turned
and
perceived
him
on
his
chair
vainly
pulling
at
his
extinguished
pipe
he
was
fifty
years
old
and
had
remained
nearly
thirty
years
a
drawer
at
the
abyss
short
and
stout
as
he
was
with
a
pale
puffy
face
one
might
have
thought
that
the
furnaces
had
swollen
instead
of
withering
him
perhaps
it
was
the
water
with
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
drench
himself
in
the
performance
of
his
work
that
had
first
given
him
the
rheumatics
at
all
events
he
had
been
attacked
in
the
legs
at
an
early
age
and
now
he
could
only
walk
with
great
difficulty
and
as
he
had
not
fulfilled
the
necessary
conditions
to
obtain
even
the
ridiculous
pension
of
three
hundred
francs
a
year
to
which
the
new
workmen
would
be
entitled
later
on
he
would
have
perished
of
starvation
in
the
streets
like
some
old
stricken
beast
of
burden
if
his
daughter
la
toupe
on
the
advice
of
bonnaire
had
not
taken
him
in
making
him
pay
for
her
generosity
in
this
respect
by
subjecting
him
to
continual
reproaches
and
all
sorts
of
privations
yes
he
slowly
repeated
knew
the
qurignons
there
was
monsieur
michel
who
now
dead
and
who
was
five
years
older
than
me
and
there
still
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
under
whom
i
first
went
to
the
works
when
i
was
eighteen
years
old
he
was
already
at
that
time
but
that
does
prevent
him
from
still
being
alive
but
before
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
there
was
monsieur
blaise
the
founder
who
first
installed
himself
at
the
abyss
with
his
nigh
on
eighty
years
ago
i
did
know
him
myself
but
my
father
jean
ragu
and
my
grandfather
pierre
ragu
worked
with
him
and
one
may
even
say
that
pierre
ragu
was
his
mate
since
they
were
both
mere
workmen
with
hardly
a
copper
in
their
pockets
when
they
started
on
the
job
together
in
the
gorge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
then
deserted
near
the
bank
of
the
mionne
where
there
was
a
waterfall
the
qurignons
made
a
big
fortune
whereas
here
am
i
jacques
ragu
with
my
bad
legs
and
never
a
copper
and
here
my
son
auguste
who
never
be
any
richer
than
i
am
after
thirty
years
hard
work
to
say
nothing
of
my
daughter
and
her
children
who
are
all
threatened
with
starvation
just
as
the
ragus
have
always
been
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
it
was
not
angrily
that
he
said
these
things
but
rather
with
the
resignation
of
an
old
stricken
animal
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
his
pipe
surprised
at
seeing
no
smoke
ascend
from
it
then
remarking
that
luc
was
listening
to
him
with
compassionate
interest
he
concluded
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
monsieur
that
the
fate
of
all
of
us
poor
devils
there
will
always
be
masters
and
workmen
my
grandfather
and
father
were
just
as
i
am
and
my
son
will
be
the
same
too
what
the
use
of
rebelling
each
of
us
draws
his
lot
when
born
all
the
same
one
thing
that
desirable
when
a
man
gets
old
is
that
he
should
at
least
have
the
means
to
buy
himself
sufficient
tobacco
cried
la
toupe
you
smoked
two
sous
worth
do
you
imagine
that
i
going
to
keep
you
in
tobacco
now
that
we
even
be
able
to
buy
bread
to
her
father
great
despair
she
rationed
him
with
respect
to
tobacco
it
was
in
vain
that
he
tried
to
get
his
pipe
alight
again
decidedly
only
ashes
were
left
in
it
and
luc
with
increasing
compassion
in
his
heart
continued
looking
at
him
as
he
sat
there
huddled
up
on
his
chair
the
ended
in
that
lamentable
wreck
of
a
man
the
worker
done
for
at
fifty
years
of
age
the
drawer
condemned
to
be
always
a
drawer
deformed
hebetated
reduced
to
imbecility
and
paralysis
by
his
mechanical
toil
in
that
poor
being
there
survived
nothing
save
the
fatalist
sentiment
of
slavery
but
bonnaire
protested
superbly
no
it
wo
always
be
like
that
there
wo
always
be
masters
and
toilers
the
day
will
come
when
one
and
all
will
be
free
and
joyful
men
our
sons
will
perhaps
see
that
day
and
it
is
really
worth
while
that
we
the
fathers
should
suffer
a
little
more
if
thereby
we
are
to
procure
happiness
for
them
it
exclaimed
ragu
in
a
merry
way
up
i
should
like
to
see
that
it
would
just
suit
me
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
and
to
eat
chicken
at
every
meal
me
too
and
me
too
seconded
bourron
in
ecstasy
me
a
place
with
a
gesture
expressive
of
utter
disillusion
old
lunot
silenced
them
in
order
to
resume
all
that
be
those
are
the
things
one
hopes
for
when
one
young
a
man
head
is
full
of
folly
then
and
he
imagines
that
he
going
to
change
the
world
but
then
the
world
goes
on
and
he
swept
away
with
the
others
i
bear
no
grudge
against
anybody
i
do
at
times
when
i
can
drag
myself
about
a
bit
i
meet
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
in
his
little
conveyance
which
a
servant
pushes
along
and
i
take
off
my
cap
to
him
because
it
only
fit
that
one
should
do
so
to
a
man
who
gave
one
work
to
do
and
who
so
rich
i
fancy
though
that
he
does
know
me
for
he
contents
himself
with
looking
at
me
with
those
eyes
of
his
which
seem
to
be
full
of
clear
water
but
when
all
said
the
qurignons
drew
the
big
prize
so
they
are
entitled
to
be
respected
ragu
thereupon
related
that
bourron
and
he
on
leaving
the
works
that
very
evening
had
seen
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
pass
in
his
little
conveyance
they
had
taken
off
their
caps
to
him
and
that
was
only
natural
how
could
they
do
otherwise
without
being
impolite
all
the
same
that
a
ragu
should
be
on
foot
in
the
mud
with
his
stomach
empty
bowing
to
a
qurignon
with
a
rug
over
him
and
a
servant
wheeling
him
about
like
a
baby
who
grown
too
fat
why
that
was
enough
to
put
one
in
a
rage
in
fact
it
gave
one
the
idea
of
throwing
one
tools
into
the
water
and
compelling
the
rich
to
shell
out
in
order
that
one
might
take
one
turn
in
doing
nothing
nothing
no
no
that
would
be
death
resumed
bonnaire
ought
to
work
in
that
way
happiness
would
be
won
and
unjust
misery
would
at
last
be
vanquished
one
must
not
envy
those
qurignons
when
they
are
quoted
as
examples
when
people
say
to
us
you
see
very
well
that
with
intelligence
toil
and
economy
a
workman
may
acquire
a
large
fortune
i
feel
a
little
irritated
because
i
understand
very
well
that
all
that
money
can
only
have
been
gained
by
exploiting
our
mates
by
docking
their
food
and
their
liberty
and
a
horrid
thing
like
that
is
always
paid
for
some
day
the
excessive
prosperity
of
any
one
individual
will
never
be
in
keeping
with
general
happiness
no
doubt
we
have
to
wait
if
we
want
to
know
what
the
future
has
in
reserve
for
each
of
us
but
i
told
you
what
my
idea
is
that
those
youngsters
of
mine
in
the
bed
yonder
who
are
listening
to
us
may
some
day
be
happier
than
i
shall
ever
be
and
that
later
on
their
children
may
in
turn
be
happier
than
they
to
bring
that
about
we
only
have
to
resolve
on
justice
to
come
to
an
understanding
like
brothers
and
secure
it
even
at
the
price
of
a
good
deal
more
wretchedness
as
bonnaire
said
lucien
and
antoinette
had
not
gone
to
sleep
again
interested
apparently
by
all
those
people
who
were
talking
so
late
they
lay
plump
and
rosy
with
their
heads
motionless
on
the
bolster
a
thoughtful
expression
appearing
in
their
large
eyes
as
if
indeed
they
could
understand
the
conversation
day
happier
than
us
said
la
toupe
viciously
of
course
that
is
if
they
do
perish
of
want
since
you
have
no
more
bread
to
give
them
those
words
fell
on
bonnaire
like
a
he
staggered
quailing
amidst
his
dream
beneath
the
sudden
icy
chill
of
the
misery
which
he
seemed
to
have
sought
by
quitting
the
works
and
luc
felt
the
quiver
of
that
misery
pass
through
that
large
bare
room
where
the
little
petroleum
lamp
was
smoking
dismally
was
not
the
struggle
an
impossible
one
would
they
not
all
grandfather
father
mother
and
children
be
condemned
to
an
early
death
if
the
should
persist
in
his
impotent
protest
against
capital
heavy
silence
came
a
big
black
shadow
seemed
to
fall
chilling
the
room
and
for
a
moment
darkening
every
face
but
a
knock
was
heard
followed
by
laughter
and
in
came
babette
bourron
wife
with
her
dollish
face
which
ever
wore
a
merry
look
plump
and
fresh
with
a
white
skin
and
heavy
tresses
of
a
wheaten
hue
she
seemed
like
eternal
spring
failing
to
find
her
husband
at
caffiaux
she
had
come
to
seek
him
at
bonnaire
well
knowing
that
he
had
some
trouble
in
getting
home
when
she
did
not
lead
him
thither
herself
moreover
she
showed
no
desire
to
scold
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
amused
as
if
she
thought
it
only
right
that
her
husband
should
have
taken
a
little
enjoyment
here
you
are
father
joy
she
gaily
cried
when
she
perceived
him
suspected
that
you
were
still
with
ragu
and
that
i
should
find
you
here
it
late
you
know
old
man
i
put
marthe
and
sÃ©bastien
to
bed
and
now
i
got
to
put
you
to
bed
too
even
as
she
never
got
angry
with
him
so
bourron
never
got
angry
with
her
for
she
showed
so
much
good
grace
in
carrying
him
off
from
his
mates
that
a
good
he
cried
you
hear
it
my
wife
puts
me
to
bed
well
well
i
agreeable
since
it
always
has
to
end
like
that
he
rose
and
babette
realising
by
the
gloominess
of
everybody
face
that
she
had
stumbled
upon
some
serious
worry
perhaps
even
a
quarrel
endeavoured
to
arrange
matters
she
in
her
own
household
sang
from
morning
till
night
showing
much
affection
for
her
husband
consoling
him
and
telling
him
triumphant
stories
of
future
prosperity
whenever
he
felt
discouraged
the
hateful
want
in
which
she
had
been
living
ever
since
childhood
had
made
no
impression
upon
her
good
spirits
she
was
quite
convinced
that
things
would
turn
out
all
right
and
for
ever
seemed
to
be
on
the
road
to
paradise
is
the
matter
with
you
all
she
asked
the
children
ill
then
as
la
toupe
once
more
exploded
relating
that
bonnaire
was
leaving
the
works
that
they
would
all
be
dead
of
starvation
before
a
week
was
over
and
that
all
beauclair
indeed
would
follow
suit
for
people
were
far
too
wretched
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
live
babette
burst
forth
into
protests
predicting
no
end
of
prosperous
days
of
sunshine
in
her
gay
and
confident
manner
no
indeed
she
cried
upset
yourself
like
that
my
dear
everything
will
settle
down
you
see
everybody
will
work
and
everybody
will
be
happy
then
she
led
her
husband
away
diverting
him
as
she
did
so
saying
such
comical
and
affectionate
things
that
he
likewise
jesting
followed
her
with
docility
his
inebriety
being
subjugated
and
rendered
inoffensive
luc
was
making
up
his
mind
to
follow
them
when
la
toupe
in
putting
her
work
together
on
the
table
there
perceived
the
key
which
she
had
thrown
down
for
her
brother
to
pick
up
are
you
going
to
take
it
she
exclaimed
you
going
to
bed
or
not
you
been
told
that
your
hussy
waiting
for
you
somewhere
oh
you
free
to
take
her
back
again
if
you
choose
you
know
for
a
moment
ragu
in
a
sneering
way
let
the
key
swing
from
one
of
his
thumbs
throughout
the
evening
he
had
been
shouting
in
bourron
face
that
he
did
not
mean
to
feed
a
lazybones
who
had
stupidly
lost
a
finger
in
a
machine
and
had
not
known
how
to
get
sufficient
compensation
for
it
since
his
return
however
he
had
become
more
sober
and
no
longer
felt
so
maliciously
obstinate
besides
his
sister
exasperated
him
with
her
perpetual
attempts
to
dictate
a
proper
line
of
conduct
to
him
course
i
can
take
her
back
if
i
choose
he
said
all
as
good
as
many
another
one
might
kill
her
and
she
would
say
a
bad
word
to
one
then
turning
to
bonnaire
who
had
remained
silent
stupid
is
josine
he
said
be
always
getting
frightened
like
that
where
has
she
got
to
now
waiting
on
the
stairs
with
nanet
said
the
master
puddler
ragu
thereupon
threw
the
door
wide
open
to
shout
josine
nobody
replied
however
not
the
faintest
sound
came
from
the
dense
darkness
enveloping
the
stairs
in
the
faint
gleam
of
light
which
the
lamp
cast
in
the
direction
of
the
landing
one
could
see
merely
nanet
who
stood
there
seemingly
watching
and
waiting
there
you
are
you
little
rascal
cried
ragu
on
earth
are
you
doing
there
the
child
was
in
no
wise
disconcerted
he
did
not
so
much
as
flinch
drawing
up
his
little
figure
no
taller
than
a
jackboot
he
bravely
answered
was
listening
so
as
to
know
your
sister
where
she
why
does
she
answer
when
called
she
was
upstairs
with
me
sitting
on
the
stairs
but
when
she
heard
you
come
in
here
she
was
afraid
that
you
might
go
up
to
beat
her
so
she
thought
it
best
to
go
down
again
so
that
she
could
run
away
if
you
were
this
made
ragu
laugh
besides
the
lad
pluck
amused
him
you
are
you
frightened
he
asked
if
you
touch
me
i
shriek
so
loud
that
my
sister
will
be
warned
and
able
to
run
away
quite
softened
the
man
went
to
lean
over
the
stairs
and
call
again
josine
here
come
up
do
be
stupid
you
know
very
well
that
i
kill
you
but
the
same
silence
continued
nothing
stirred
nothing
ascended
from
the
darkness
and
luc
whose
presence
was
no
longer
requisite
took
leave
bowing
to
la
toupe
who
with
her
lips
compressed
stiffly
bent
her
head
the
children
had
gone
off
to
sleep
again
old
lunot
still
with
his
extinguished
pipe
in
his
mouth
had
managed
to
reach
the
little
chamber
where
he
slept
hugging
the
walls
on
his
way
and
bonnaire
who
in
his
turn
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
silent
amidst
his
cheerless
surroundings
his
eyes
gazing
far
away
into
the
threatening
future
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
follow
his
terrible
wife
to
bed
up
your
courage
said
luc
to
him
whilst
vigorously
shaking
his
hand
on
the
landing
ragu
was
still
calling
in
tones
which
now
became
entreating
come
josine
i
tell
you
that
i
no
longer
angry
and
as
no
sign
of
life
came
from
the
darkness
he
turned
towards
nanet
who
meddled
with
nothing
preferring
that
his
sister
should
act
as
she
pleased
she
run
off
said
the
man
no
where
would
you
have
her
go
she
must
have
sat
down
on
the
stairs
again
luc
was
now
descending
clinging
the
while
to
the
greasy
rope
and
feeling
the
high
and
precipitous
stairs
with
his
feet
for
fear
lest
he
should
fall
so
dense
was
the
darkness
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
descending
into
a
black
abyss
by
means
of
a
fragile
ladder
placed
between
two
damp
walls
and
as
he
went
lower
and
lower
he
fancied
that
he
could
hear
some
stifled
sobs
rising
from
the
dolorous
depths
of
the
gloom
overhead
ragu
resumed
resolutely
josine
why
do
you
come
do
you
want
me
to
go
and
fetch
you
then
luc
paused
for
he
detected
a
faint
breath
approaching
something
warm
and
gentle
a
light
living
quiver
scarcely
perceptible
which
became
more
and
more
tremulous
as
it
drew
nearer
and
he
stepped
back
close
to
the
wall
for
he
well
understood
that
a
human
creature
was
about
to
pass
him
invisibly
recognisable
only
by
the
discreet
touch
of
her
figure
as
she
went
upward
is
i
josine
he
whispered
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
frightened
the
little
breath
was
still
ascending
and
no
reply
came
but
that
creature
all
distress
and
misery
passed
brushing
lightly
almost
imperceptibly
against
him
and
a
feverish
little
hand
caught
hold
of
his
own
a
burning
mouth
was
pressed
to
that
hand
of
his
and
kissed
it
ardently
in
an
impulse
of
infinite
gratitude
instinct
with
the
gift
of
a
soul
she
thanked
him
she
gave
herself
like
one
unknown
veiled
from
sight
full
of
the
sweetest
girlishness
not
a
word
was
exchanged
there
was
only
that
silent
kiss
moistened
by
warm
tears
in
the
dense
gloom
the
little
breath
had
already
passed
the
light
form
was
still
ascending
and
luc
remained
overcome
affected
to
the
depths
of
his
being
by
that
faint
touch
the
kiss
of
those
invisible
lips
had
gone
to
his
heart
a
sweet
and
powerful
charm
had
flowed
into
his
veins
he
tried
to
think
that
he
simply
felt
well
pleased
at
having
at
last
helped
josine
to
secure
a
that
night
but
why
had
she
been
weeping
seated
on
the
step
of
the
stairs
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
house
and
why
had
she
so
long
delayed
returning
an
answer
to
the
man
overhead
who
offered
her
a
lodging
once
more
was
it
that
she
had
experienced
mortal
grief
and
regret
that
she
had
sobbed
at
the
thought
of
some
unrealisable
dream
and
that
in
going
up
at
last
she
had
simply
yielded
to
the
necessity
of
resuming
the
life
which
fate
condemned
her
to
lead
for
the
last
time
ragu
voice
was
heard
up
above
there
you
are
it
none
too
soon
come
you
big
stupid
let
go
up
we
kill
one
another
at
any
rate
then
luc
fled
feeling
such
despair
that
he
instinctively
sought
the
why
and
wherefore
of
that
frightful
bitterness
whilst
he
found
his
way
with
difficulty
through
the
dim
maze
of
the
filthy
lanes
of
old
beauclair
he
pondered
over
things
and
gave
rein
to
his
compassion
poor
girl
she
was
the
victim
of
her
surroundings
never
would
she
have
led
such
a
life
had
it
not
been
for
the
crushing
weight
and
perverting
influence
of
misery
and
want
and
picturing
mankind
as
plough
land
luc
thought
how
thoroughly
it
would
have
to
be
turned
over
in
order
that
work
might
become
honour
and
delight
in
order
that
strong
and
healthy
love
might
sprout
and
flower
amidst
a
great
harvest
of
truth
and
justice
meantime
it
was
evidently
best
that
the
poor
girl
should
remain
with
that
man
ragu
provided
that
he
did
not
her
too
much
then
luc
glanced
upward
at
the
sky
the
tempest
blast
had
ceased
blowing
and
stars
were
appearing
between
the
heavy
and
motionless
clouds
but
how
dark
was
the
night
how
great
the
melancholy
in
which
his
heart
was
steeped
all
at
once
he
came
out
on
the
bank
of
the
mionne
near
the
wooden
bridge
in
front
of
him
was
the
abyss
ever
at
work
sending
forth
a
dull
rumble
amidst
the
clear
dancing
notes
of
its
which
the
deeper
thuds
of
the
punctuated
now
and
again
a
fiery
glow
transpierced
the
gloom
and
huge
livid
clouds
of
smoke
passing
athwart
the
rays
of
the
electric
lamps
showed
like
a
stormy
horizon
about
the
works
and
the
nocturnal
life
of
that
monster
whose
furnaces
were
never
extinguished
brought
back
to
luc
a
vision
of
murderous
labour
imposed
on
men
as
in
a
convict
prison
and
remunerated
for
the
most
part
with
mistrust
and
contempt
then
bonnaire
handsome
face
passed
before
the
young
fellow
eyes
he
perceived
him
as
he
had
left
him
in
the
dim
room
yonder
overcome
like
a
vanquished
man
in
presence
of
the
uncertain
future
and
without
transition
there
came
another
memory
of
his
evening
the
vague
profile
of
lange
the
potter
pouring
forth
his
curse
with
all
the
vehemence
of
a
prophet
predicting
the
destruction
of
beauclair
beneath
the
sum
of
its
crimes
but
at
that
hour
the
terrorised
town
had
fallen
asleep
and
all
one
could
see
of
it
on
the
fringe
of
the
plain
was
a
confused
dense
mass
where
not
a
light
gleamed
nothing
indeed
seemed
to
exist
save
the
abyss
whose
hellish
life
knew
no
respite
there
a
noise
as
of
thunder
continually
rolled
by
and
flames
incessantly
devoured
the
lives
of
men
suddenly
a
clock
struck
midnight
in
the
distance
and
luc
then
crossed
the
bridge
and
again
went
down
the
brias
road
on
his
way
back
to
la
crÃªcherie
where
his
bed
awaited
him
as
he
was
reaching
it
a
mighty
glow
suddenly
illumined
the
whole
district
the
two
promontories
of
the
bleuse
mountains
the
slumbering
roofs
of
the
town
and
even
the
fields
of
la
roumagne
that
glow
came
from
the
blast
furnace
whose
black
silhouette
appeared
half
way
up
the
height
as
in
the
midst
of
a
conflagration
and
as
luc
raised
his
eyes
it
once
more
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
beheld
some
red
dawn
the
sunrise
promised
to
his
dream
of
the
renovation
of
humanity
that
is
about
per
pound
lbs
iii
on
the
morrow
sunday
just
as
luc
had
risen
he
received
a
friendly
note
from
madame
boisgelin
inviting
him
to
lunch
at
la
guerdache
having
learnt
that
he
was
at
beauclair
and
that
the
jordans
would
only
return
home
on
the
monday
she
told
him
how
happy
she
would
be
to
see
him
again
in
order
that
they
might
chat
together
about
their
old
friendship
in
paris
where
they
had
secretly
conducted
some
big
charitable
enterprises
together
in
the
needy
district
of
the
faubourg
antoine
and
luc
who
regarded
madame
boisgelin
with
a
kind
of
affectionate
reverence
at
once
accepted
her
invitation
writing
word
that
he
would
be
at
la
guerdache
by
eleven
superb
weather
had
suddenly
followed
the
week
of
heavy
rain
by
which
beauclair
had
almost
been
submerged
the
sun
had
risen
radiantly
in
the
sky
which
was
now
of
a
pure
blue
as
if
it
had
been
cleansed
by
all
the
showers
and
the
bright
sun
of
september
still
diffused
so
much
warmth
that
the
roads
were
already
dry
luc
was
therefore
well
pleased
to
walk
the
couple
of
thousand
yards
which
separated
la
guerdache
from
the
town
when
about
a
quarter
past
ten
he
passed
through
the
latter
that
is
the
new
town
which
stretched
from
the
place
de
la
mairie
to
the
fields
fringing
la
roumagne
he
was
surprised
by
its
brightness
cheerfulness
and
trimness
and
sorrowfully
recalled
the
dismal
aspect
of
the
quarter
which
he
had
seen
the
previous
night
in
the
new
town
were
assembled
the
the
law
court
and
the
prison
the
last
being
a
handsome
new
building
whose
was
scarcely
dry
as
for
the
church
of
vincent
an
elegant
church
astride
the
old
and
the
now
towns
it
had
lately
been
repaired
for
its
steeple
had
shown
an
inclination
to
topple
down
upon
the
faithful
and
as
luc
went
on
he
noticed
that
the
sunlight
gilded
the
smart
houses
of
the
and
brightened
even
the
place
de
la
mairie
which
spread
out
beyond
the
populous
rue
de
brias
displaying
a
huge
and
ancient
building
which
served
as
both
a
town
hall
and
a
school
luc
however
speedily
reached
the
fields
by
way
of
the
rue
de
formerie
which
stretched
straight
away
beyond
the
square
like
a
continuation
of
the
rue
de
brias
la
guerdache
was
on
the
formerie
road
just
outside
beauclair
thus
luc
had
no
occasion
to
hurry
and
indeed
he
strolled
along
like
one
in
a
dreamy
mood
at
times
he
even
turned
round
and
then
northward
beyond
the
town
whose
houses
descended
a
slight
slope
he
perceived
the
huge
bar
of
the
bleuse
mountains
parted
by
the
precipitously
enclosed
gorge
through
which
the
mionne
torrent
flowed
in
that
kind
of
estuary
opening
into
the
plain
one
could
distinctly
perceive
the
buildings
and
lofty
chimneys
of
the
abyss
as
well
as
the
of
la
crÃªcherie
in
fact
quite
an
industrial
city
which
was
visible
from
every
side
of
la
roumagne
leagues
and
leagues
away
luc
remained
gazing
at
the
scene
for
some
little
time
and
when
he
slowly
resumed
his
walk
towards
la
guerdache
which
he
could
already
discern
beyond
some
clusters
of
magnificent
trees
he
recalled
the
typical
history
of
the
qurignons
which
his
friend
jordan
had
once
told
him
it
was
in
that
blaise
qurignon
the
workman
by
whom
the
abyss
had
been
founded
had
installed
himself
there
on
the
bank
of
the
torrent
with
his
two
he
had
never
employed
more
than
a
score
of
hands
and
making
but
a
small
fortune
had
contented
himself
with
building
near
the
works
a
little
brick
pavilion
in
which
delaveau
the
present
manager
now
resided
it
was
jÃ©rÃ´me
qurignon
the
second
of
the
line
born
in
the
year
when
his
father
founded
the
abyss
who
became
a
real
king
of
industry
in
him
met
all
the
creative
power
derived
from
a
long
ancestry
of
workmen
all
the
incipient
efforts
the
growth
and
rise
of
people
hundreds
of
years
of
latent
energy
a
long
line
of
ancestors
obstinately
seeking
happiness
wrathfully
battling
in
the
gloom
working
themselves
at
times
to
death
now
at
last
yielded
fruit
culminated
in
the
advent
of
this
victor
who
could
toil
eighteen
hours
a
day
and
whose
intelligence
good
sense
and
will
swept
all
obstacles
aside
in
less
than
twenty
years
he
caused
a
town
to
spring
from
the
ground
gave
employment
to
twelve
hundred
workpeople
and
gained
millions
of
francs
and
at
last
stifling
in
the
humble
little
house
erected
by
his
father
he
expended
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
on
the
purchase
of
la
guerdache
a
large
and
sumptuous
residence
in
which
ten
families
might
have
found
accommodation
whilst
around
it
stretched
a
park
and
a
farm
the
whole
forming
in
fact
a
large
estate
jÃ©rÃ´me
was
convinced
that
la
guerdache
would
become
as
it
were
the
patriarchal
home
of
his
descendants
all
the
bright
and
loving
couples
who
would
assuredly
spring
from
his
wealth
as
from
some
blessed
soil
for
them
he
prepared
a
future
of
domination
based
on
his
dream
of
subjugating
labour
and
utilising
it
for
the
enjoyment
of
an
for
was
not
all
the
power
that
he
felt
within
him
definitive
and
infinite
and
would
it
not
even
increase
among
his
children
free
from
all
danger
of
diminution
and
exhaustion
during
long
long
years
but
all
at
once
a
first
misfortune
fell
upon
this
man
who
seemed
to
be
as
vigorous
as
an
whilst
he
was
still
young
in
his
very
prime
indeed
only
two
and
fifty
years
of
age
paralysis
deprived
him
of
the
use
of
both
his
legs
and
he
had
to
surrender
the
management
of
the
abyss
to
michel
his
eldest
son
michel
qurignon
the
third
of
the
line
was
then
just
thirty
he
had
a
younger
brother
philippe
who
much
against
his
father
wishes
had
married
in
paris
a
wonderfully
beautiful
but
very
flighty
woman
and
between
the
two
boys
there
was
a
girl
laure
already
years
old
who
greatly
distressed
her
parents
by
the
extreme
religiosity
into
which
she
had
fallen
michel
for
his
part
had
when
very
young
married
an
extremely
gentle
loving
but
delicate
woman
by
whom
he
had
two
children
gustave
and
suzanne
the
former
being
five
and
the
latter
three
years
old
when
their
father
was
suddenly
obliged
to
assume
the
management
of
the
abyss
it
was
understood
that
he
should
do
so
in
the
name
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
family
each
member
of
which
was
to
draw
a
share
of
the
profits
according
to
an
agreement
which
had
been
arrived
at
although
michel
did
not
in
the
same
high
degree
possess
his
admirable
qualities
his
power
of
work
his
quick
intelligence
and
his
methodical
habits
he
none
the
less
at
first
proved
an
excellent
manager
and
for
ten
years
succeeded
in
preventing
any
decline
in
the
business
which
indeed
he
at
one
moment
increased
by
replacing
the
old
plant
by
new
appliances
but
sorrows
and
family
losses
fell
upon
him
like
premonitory
signs
of
a
coming
disaster
his
mother
died
his
father
was
not
only
paralysed
and
wheeled
about
by
a
servant
but
sank
into
absolute
dumbness
after
experiencing
a
difficulty
in
uttering
certain
words
then
michel
sister
laure
her
brain
quite
turned
by
mystical
notions
took
the
veil
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
made
to
detain
her
at
la
guerdache
amidst
the
joys
of
the
world
and
from
paris
too
michel
received
deplorable
tidings
of
the
affairs
of
his
brother
philippe
whose
wife
was
taking
to
scandalous
adventures
dragging
him
moreover
into
a
wild
life
of
gambling
extravagance
and
folly
finally
michel
lost
his
own
delicate
and
gentle
wife
which
proved
indeed
his
supreme
loss
for
it
threw
him
off
his
balance
and
cast
him
into
a
life
of
disorder
he
had
already
yielded
to
his
passions
but
in
a
discreet
way
for
fear
of
saddening
his
wife
who
was
always
ill
but
when
death
had
carried
her
away
nothing
was
left
to
restrain
him
and
he
took
freely
to
a
life
of
pleasure
which
consumed
the
best
part
of
his
time
and
his
energies
then
came
another
period
of
ten
years
during
which
the
abyss
declined
since
it
was
no
longer
directed
by
the
victorious
chief
of
the
days
of
conquest
but
by
a
tired
and
satiated
master
who
squandered
all
the
booty
it
yielded
a
feverish
passion
for
luxury
now
possessed
michel
his
existence
became
all
festivity
and
pleasure
the
spending
of
money
for
the
merely
material
joys
of
life
and
the
worst
was
that
in
addition
to
this
cause
of
ruin
in
addition
moreover
to
bad
management
and
loss
of
energy
there
came
a
commercial
crisis
in
which
the
whole
metallurgie
industry
of
the
region
nearly
perished
it
became
impossible
to
manufacture
steel
rails
and
girders
cheaply
enough
in
face
of
the
victorious
competition
of
the
works
of
northern
and
eastern
france
which
thanks
to
a
newly
discovered
chemical
process
were
now
able
to
employ
defective
ore
which
formerly
it
had
been
impossible
to
utilise
thus
after
a
struggle
of
two
years
duration
michel
felt
the
abyss
crumbling
to
pieces
beneath
him
and
one
day
when
he
was
already
unhinged
by
having
to
borrow
three
hundred
thousand
francs
to
meet
some
heavy
bills
then
reaching
maturity
a
horrible
drama
drove
him
to
desperation
he
was
then
nearly
years
old
and
was
madly
in
love
with
a
pretty
girl
whom
he
had
brought
from
paris
and
concealed
in
beauclair
at
times
he
indulged
in
the
wild
dream
of
fleeing
with
her
to
some
land
of
the
sun
far
away
from
all
financial
worries
his
son
gustave
who
after
failing
in
his
studies
led
an
idle
life
at
years
of
age
resided
with
him
on
a
footing
of
friendly
equality
well
acquainted
with
the
intrigue
about
which
indeed
he
often
jested
he
made
fun
also
of
the
abyss
refusing
to
set
foot
amongst
all
that
grimy
old
iron
for
he
greatly
preferred
to
ride
hunt
and
shoot
and
generally
lead
the
empty
life
of
an
amiable
young
man
as
if
he
could
count
several
centuries
of
illustrious
ancestry
and
thus
it
happened
that
one
fine
evening
after
out
of
a
the
single
hundred
thousand
francs
which
his
father
had
as
yet
managed
to
get
together
for
his
payments
master
gustave
carried
off
the
pretty
girl
who
had
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
at
the
sight
of
so
much
money
and
on
the
morrow
michel
struck
both
in
heart
and
brain
by
this
collapse
of
his
passion
and
his
fortune
yielded
to
the
vertigo
of
horror
and
shot
himself
dead
with
a
revolver
three
years
had
already
elapsed
since
that
suicide
and
the
speedy
downfall
of
one
qurignon
had
been
followed
by
that
of
another
and
another
as
if
by
way
of
example
to
show
how
great
might
prove
the
severity
of
destiny
shortly
after
gustave
departure
it
was
learnt
that
he
had
been
killed
in
a
carriage
accident
at
nice
a
pair
of
runaway
horses
having
carried
him
over
a
precipice
then
younger
brother
philippe
likewise
disappeared
from
the
scene
being
killed
in
a
duel
the
outcome
of
a
dirty
affair
into
which
he
had
been
drawn
by
his
terrible
wife
who
was
said
to
be
now
in
russia
with
a
tenor
whilst
the
only
child
born
to
them
andrÃ©
qurignon
the
last
of
the
line
had
been
sent
perforce
to
a
private
asylum
since
he
suffered
from
an
affection
of
the
spine
complicated
by
mental
disorder
apart
from
that
sufferer
and
laure
who
still
led
a
cloistral
life
so
that
she
also
seemed
to
be
dead
there
remained
of
all
the
qurignons
only
old
jÃ©rÃ´me
and
michel
daughter
suzanne
she
when
twenty
years
of
age
that
is
five
years
before
her
death
had
married
boisgelin
who
had
met
her
whilst
visiting
at
a
country
house
although
the
abyss
was
then
already
in
peril
michel
in
his
ostentatious
way
had
made
arrangements
which
enabled
him
to
give
his
daughter
a
dowry
of
a
million
francs
boisgelin
on
his
side
was
very
wealthy
having
inherited
from
his
grandfather
and
father
a
fortune
of
more
than
six
millions
amassed
in
all
sorts
of
suspicious
affairs
redolent
of
usury
and
theft
by
which
he
however
was
not
personally
besmirched
since
he
had
lived
in
perfect
idleness
ever
since
his
entry
into
the
world
he
was
held
in
great
esteem
and
envy
and
people
were
always
eager
to
bow
to
him
for
he
resided
in
a
superb
mansion
near
the
parc
monceau
in
paris
and
led
a
life
of
wild
display
and
extravagance
after
seeking
distinction
by
remaining
invariably
the
last
of
his
class
at
the
lycÃ©e
condorcet
which
he
had
astonished
by
his
elegance
he
had
never
done
anything
but
imagined
himself
to
be
a
aristocrat
one
who
established
his
claim
to
nobility
by
the
magnificence
he
showed
in
spending
the
fortune
acquired
by
his
forerunners
without
even
lowering
himself
to
earn
a
copper
the
misfortune
was
that
boisgelin
six
millions
no
longer
sufficed
at
last
to
keep
his
establishment
on
the
high
footing
which
it
had
reached
and
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
financial
speculations
of
which
he
understood
nothing
the
bourse
was
just
then
going
mad
over
some
new
gold
mines
and
he
was
told
that
by
venturing
his
fortune
he
might
treble
it
in
two
years
time
all
at
once
however
came
disaster
and
downfall
and
for
a
moment
he
almost
thought
that
he
was
absolutely
ruined
to
such
a
point
indeed
as
to
retain
not
even
a
crust
of
bread
for
the
morrow
he
wept
like
a
child
at
the
thought
and
looked
at
his
hands
which
had
ever
idled
wondering
what
he
would
now
be
able
to
do
since
he
knew
not
how
to
work
with
them
it
was
then
that
suzanne
his
wife
evinced
admirable
affection
good
sense
and
courage
in
such
wise
as
to
set
him
on
his
feet
again
she
reminded
him
that
her
own
million
her
dowry
was
intact
and
she
insisted
on
having
the
situation
retrieved
by
selling
the
mansion
which
they
would
now
be
unable
to
keep
up
another
million
was
found
in
that
way
but
how
were
they
to
live
particularly
in
paris
on
the
proceeds
of
two
millions
of
francs
when
six
had
not
sufficed
for
temptation
would
assuredly
come
again
at
the
sight
of
all
the
luxury
consuming
the
great
city
a
chance
encounter
at
last
decided
the
future
boisgelin
had
a
poor
cousin
a
certain
delaveau
the
son
of
one
of
his
father
sisters
whose
husband
an
unlucky
inventor
had
left
her
miserably
poor
delaveau
a
petty
engineer
occupied
a
modest
post
at
a
brias
at
the
time
when
michel
qurignon
committed
suicide
devoured
by
a
craving
to
succeed
urged
on
too
by
his
wife
and
very
well
acquainted
with
the
situation
of
the
abyss
which
he
felt
certain
he
could
restore
to
prosperity
by
a
new
system
of
organisation
he
went
to
paris
in
search
of
capitalists
and
there
one
evening
in
the
street
he
suddenly
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
cousin
boisgelin
inspiration
at
once
came
to
him
how
was
it
that
he
had
not
previously
thought
of
that
wealthy
relative
who
as
it
happened
had
married
a
qurignon
on
learning
what
was
the
present
position
of
the
boisgelins
now
reduced
to
a
couple
of
millions
which
they
wished
to
invest
as
advantageously
as
possible
delaveau
extended
his
plans
and
at
several
interviews
which
he
had
with
his
cousin
displayed
so
much
assurance
intelligence
and
energy
that
he
ended
by
convincing
him
of
success
there
was
really
genius
in
the
plan
he
had
devised
the
boisgelins
must
profit
by
the
catastrophe
which
had
fallen
on
michel
qurignon
buy
the
works
for
a
million
francs
when
they
were
worth
two
millions
and
start
making
steel
of
superior
quality
which
would
rapidly
bring
in
large
profits
moreover
why
should
not
the
boisgelins
also
buy
la
guerdache
in
the
forced
liquidation
of
the
qurignon
fortune
they
would
easily
secure
it
for
five
hundred
thousand
francs
although
it
had
cost
eight
hundred
thousand
and
boisgelin
out
of
his
two
millions
would
then
still
have
half
a
million
left
to
serve
as
working
capital
for
the
abyss
he
delaveau
absolutely
contracted
to
increase
that
capital
tenfold
and
supply
the
boisgelins
with
a
princely
income
they
would
simply
have
to
leave
paris
and
live
happily
and
comfortably
at
la
guerdache
pending
the
accumulation
of
the
large
fortune
which
they
would
assuredly
possess
some
day
when
they
might
once
more
return
to
parisian
life
to
enjoy
it
amidst
all
the
magnificence
they
could
dream
of
it
was
suzanne
who
at
last
secured
the
compliance
of
her
husband
who
felt
anxious
at
the
idea
of
leading
a
provincial
life
in
which
he
would
probably
be
bored
to
death
she
herself
was
delighted
to
return
to
la
guerdache
where
she
had
spent
her
childhood
and
youth
thus
matters
were
settled
as
delaveau
had
foreseen
the
liquidation
of
the
qurignon
estate
took
place
and
the
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
which
the
boisgelins
paid
for
the
abyss
and
la
guerdache
proved
barely
sufficient
to
meet
the
liabilities
in
such
wise
that
suzanne
and
her
husband
became
absolute
masters
of
everything
having
no
further
accounts
to
render
to
the
other
surviving
heirs
that
is
aunt
laure
the
nun
and
andrÃ©
the
infirm
and
mentally
afflicted
young
fellow
who
had
been
sent
to
a
private
asylum
on
the
other
hand
delaveau
carried
out
all
his
engagements
reorganised
the
works
renewed
the
plant
and
proved
so
successful
in
his
management
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
twelve
months
the
profits
were
already
superb
in
three
years
the
abyss
recovered
its
position
as
one
of
the
most
prosperous
steel
works
of
the
region
and
the
money
earned
for
boisgelin
by
its
twelve
hundred
workpeople
enabled
him
to
instal
himself
at
la
guerdache
on
a
footing
of
great
luxury
he
had
six
horses
in
his
stables
five
carriages
in
his
and
organised
and
all
sorts
of
festivities
to
which
the
local
authorities
eagerly
sought
invitations
thus
he
who
during
the
earlier
months
had
gone
about
idle
and
dreary
quite
now
seemed
to
have
accustomed
himself
to
provincial
life
having
discovered
as
it
were
a
little
empire
where
his
vanity
found
every
satisfaction
moreover
there
was
a
secret
cause
behind
all
other
things
an
element
of
victorious
conceit
in
the
quietly
condescending
manner
in
which
he
reigned
over
beauclair
delaveau
had
installed
himself
at
the
abyss
where
he
occupied
blaise
qurignon
former
house
with
his
wife
fernande
and
their
little
girl
nise
who
at
that
time
was
only
a
few
months
old
he
had
then
completed
his
year
and
his
wife
was
ten
years
younger
her
mother
a
music
teacher
had
formerly
resided
on
the
same
floor
as
himself
in
a
dark
house
of
the
rue
in
paris
fernande
was
of
such
dazzling
sovereign
beauty
that
for
more
than
a
twelvemonth
whenever
delaveau
met
her
on
the
stairs
he
drew
back
trembling
against
the
wall
like
one
who
felt
ashamed
of
his
ugliness
and
his
poverty
at
last
however
salutes
were
exchanged
and
an
acquaintance
having
sprung
up
the
girl
mother
confided
to
him
that
she
had
lived
for
twelve
years
in
russia
as
a
governess
and
that
fernande
was
her
daughter
by
a
russian
prince
by
whom
she
had
been
deceived
this
prince
who
was
extremely
attached
to
her
would
certainly
have
dowered
her
with
a
fortune
but
one
evening
at
the
close
of
a
day
hunt
he
was
accidentally
shot
dead
and
she
then
had
to
return
penniless
to
paris
with
her
little
girl
and
once
more
give
lessons
there
only
by
the
most
desperate
hard
work
did
she
manage
to
bring
up
the
child
for
whom
in
spite
of
everything
she
dreamt
of
some
prodigious
destiny
fernande
reared
amidst
adulation
from
her
cradle
convinced
that
her
beauty
destined
her
for
a
throne
encountered
in
lieu
thereof
the
blackest
wretchedness
unable
to
throw
her
boots
aside
since
she
knew
not
how
to
replace
them
and
being
for
ever
obliged
to
repair
and
refurbish
her
old
gowns
and
hats
anger
and
such
a
craving
for
victory
soon
took
possession
of
her
that
from
her
tenth
year
onward
she
did
not
live
a
day
without
learning
more
and
more
hatred
envy
and
cruelty
in
this
wise
amassing
extraordinary
force
of
perversity
and
destructiveness
the
climax
came
when
imagining
that
her
beauty
was
bound
to
conquer
by
virtue
of
its
she
yielded
to
a
man
of
wealth
and
power
who
on
the
morrow
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
her
this
adventure
which
she
sought
to
bury
in
the
bitterest
depths
of
her
being
taught
her
the
arts
of
falsehood
hypocrisy
and
craftiness
which
she
had
not
previously
mastered
she
vowed
that
she
would
not
stumble
in
that
way
again
for
she
was
far
too
ambitious
to
lead
a
life
of
open
shame
she
realised
that
it
was
not
sufficient
for
a
woman
to
be
beautiful
that
she
must
find
the
proper
opportunity
to
display
her
beauty
and
must
meet
a
man
such
as
she
could
bewitch
and
turn
into
her
obedient
slave
and
her
mother
having
died
after
trudging
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
through
the
mud
of
paris
to
give
lessons
which
barely
yielded
enough
money
to
buy
bread
she
fernande
felt
a
first
opportunity
arise
on
finding
herself
in
presence
of
delaveau
who
whilst
neither
handsome
nor
rich
offered
to
marry
her
she
did
not
care
a
pin
for
him
but
she
perceived
that
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
and
she
decided
to
avail
herself
of
his
arm
to
enter
the
world
of
respectable
women
in
which
he
would
prove
a
support
and
a
means
towards
the
end
that
she
had
in
view
he
had
to
buy
her
a
trousseau
taking
her
just
as
he
found
her
with
all
the
faith
of
a
devotee
for
whom
she
was
a
goddess
and
from
that
time
forward
destiny
followed
its
course
even
as
she
fernande
had
desired
within
two
months
of
being
introduced
at
la
guerdache
by
her
husband
she
designedly
entered
upon
an
intrigue
with
boisgelin
who
had
become
passionately
enamoured
of
her
in
that
handsome
clubman
and
horseman
she
found
the
ideal
lover
for
whom
she
had
sought
the
lover
all
vanity
folly
and
liberality
who
was
capable
of
the
worst
things
in
order
to
retain
his
beautiful
mistress
beside
him
and
it
so
happened
moreover
that
she
thus
satisfied
all
sorts
of
spite
and
rancour
the
covert
hatred
which
she
bore
her
husband
whose
toilsome
life
and
quiet
blindness
humiliated
her
and
the
growing
jealousy
which
she
felt
towards
the
quiet
suzanne
whom
she
had
detested
from
the
very
first
day
this
indeed
being
one
of
the
reasons
why
she
had
listened
to
boisgelin
for
she
hoped
thereby
to
make
suzanne
suffer
and
now
all
was
festivity
at
la
guerdache
fernande
reigned
there
like
a
beautiful
guest
realising
her
dream
of
a
life
of
display
in
which
she
helped
boisgelin
to
squander
the
money
which
delaveau
wrung
in
perspiration
from
the
twelve
hundred
toilers
of
the
abyss
and
indeed
she
even
hoped
that
she
would
some
fine
day
be
able
to
return
to
paris
and
triumph
there
with
all
the
promised
millions
such
were
the
stories
which
occupied
luc
thoughts
as
sauntering
along
he
repaired
to
la
guerdache
in
accordance
with
invitation
if
he
did
not
know
everything
as
yet
he
at
least
already
suspected
certain
matters
which
the
near
future
was
to
enable
him
to
fathom
completely
at
last
as
he
raised
his
head
he
perceived
that
he
was
only
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
fine
park
whose
great
trees
spread
their
greenery
over
a
large
expanse
then
he
paused
whilst
before
his
mind
eye
there
arose
above
all
other
figures
that
of
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
the
second
qurignon
the
founder
of
the
family
fortune
the
infirm
paralysed
man
whom
only
the
day
before
he
had
met
in
his
pushed
along
by
a
servant
near
the
very
entrance
of
the
abyss
he
pictured
him
with
his
lifeless
stricken
legs
his
silent
lips
and
his
clear
eyes
which
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
had
been
gazing
at
the
disasters
that
overwhelmed
his
race
there
was
his
son
michel
hungering
for
pleasure
and
luxury
imperilling
the
works
and
killing
himself
as
the
result
of
a
frightful
family
drama
there
was
his
grandson
gustave
carrying
off
his
father
mistress
and
dashing
his
brains
out
in
the
depths
of
a
precipice
as
beneath
the
vengeful
pursuit
of
the
furies
there
was
his
daughter
laure
in
a
convent
cut
off
from
the
world
and
there
was
his
younger
son
philippe
marrying
an
unworthy
woman
gliding
with
her
into
the
mire
and
losing
his
life
in
a
duel
after
the
most
disgraceful
adventures
and
there
was
his
other
grandson
andrÃ©
the
last
of
the
name
a
cripple
shut
up
amongst
the
insane
and
yet
even
now
the
disaster
was
continuing
the
annihilation
of
the
family
was
being
completed
by
an
evil
ferment
that
fernande
who
had
appeared
among
them
as
if
to
consummate
their
ruin
with
those
terrible
sharp
white
teeth
of
hers
amidst
his
long
silence
jÃ©rÃ´me
had
witnessed
and
was
witnessing
all
those
things
but
did
he
remark
them
did
he
judge
them
it
was
said
that
his
mind
had
become
weak
and
yet
how
deep
and
limpid
were
his
eyes
and
if
he
could
think
what
thoughts
were
those
that
filled
his
long
hours
of
immobility
all
his
hopes
had
crumbled
the
victorious
strength
amassed
through
a
long
ancestry
of
toilers
the
energy
which
he
thought
he
was
bound
to
bequeath
to
a
long
line
of
descendants
whose
fortune
would
ever
and
ever
increase
had
now
blazed
away
like
a
heap
of
straw
in
the
fire
of
worldly
enjoyment
in
three
generations
the
reserve
of
creative
power
which
had
required
so
many
centuries
of
wretchedness
and
effort
to
accumulate
had
been
gluttonously
consumed
amidst
the
eager
satisfaction
of
material
cravings
the
nerves
of
the
race
had
become
unstrung
refinement
had
led
to
destructive
degeneracy
gorged
too
quickly
unhinged
by
possession
the
race
had
collapsed
amidst
all
the
folly
born
of
wealth
and
that
royal
domain
la
guerdache
which
he
jÃ©rÃ´me
had
purchased
dreaming
of
some
day
peopling
it
with
numerous
descendants
happy
couples
who
would
diffuse
the
blessed
glory
of
his
name
how
sad
he
must
feel
at
seeing
half
its
rooms
empty
what
anger
he
must
experience
at
seeing
it
virtually
handed
over
to
that
strange
woman
who
brought
the
final
poisonous
ferment
in
the
folds
of
her
skirts
he
himself
lived
there
in
solitude
keeping
up
an
affectionate
intercourse
solely
with
his
granddaughter
suzanne
who
was
the
only
person
still
admitted
to
the
large
room
which
he
occupied
on
the
ground
floor
she
when
only
ten
years
old
had
already
helped
to
nurse
him
there
like
a
loving
little
girl
touched
by
her
poor
misfortune
and
when
she
had
returned
to
the
spot
a
married
woman
after
the
purchase
of
the
family
property
she
had
insisted
on
her
grandfather
remaining
there
although
nothing
belonged
to
him
for
he
had
divided
his
whole
property
among
his
children
at
the
time
when
paralysis
had
fallen
on
him
like
a
thunderbolt
suzanne
was
not
without
scruples
in
this
matter
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
following
delaveau
advice
she
and
her
husband
had
despoiled
the
two
remaining
members
of
the
family
aunt
laure
and
andrÃ©
the
cripple
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
provided
for
and
thus
it
was
on
grandfather
jÃ©rÃ´me
that
she
lavished
her
affection
watching
over
him
like
a
good
angel
but
although
a
smile
would
appear
in
the
depths
of
his
clear
eyes
when
he
fixed
them
upon
her
there
remained
as
it
were
but
two
cavities
seemingly
full
of
spring
water
in
his
frigid
deeply
marked
countenance
directly
the
wild
life
of
la
guerdache
flitted
past
him
was
he
conscious
of
it
and
did
he
think
about
it
and
if
so
were
not
his
thoughts
compounded
of
despair
luc
found
himself
at
last
before
the
monumental
iron
gate
opening
into
the
formerie
highway
at
a
point
whence
started
a
road
leading
to
the
neighbouring
village
of
les
combettes
and
he
simply
had
to
push
a
little
side
gate
open
in
order
to
reach
the
royal
avenue
of
beyond
them
one
saw
the
chÃ¢teau
a
huge
pile
quite
imposing
in
its
simplicity
with
its
two
upper
stories
each
showing
a
line
of
twelve
windows
and
its
raised
ground
floor
which
was
reached
by
a
double
flight
of
steps
decorated
with
some
handsome
vases
the
park
which
was
of
great
extent
all
copses
and
lawns
was
traversed
by
the
mionne
which
fed
a
large
piece
of
ornamental
water
where
swans
swam
to
and
fro
luc
was
already
going
towards
the
steps
when
a
light
welcoming
laugh
made
him
turn
his
head
under
an
near
a
stone
table
surrounded
by
some
rustic
chairs
he
then
perceived
suzanne
who
sat
there
with
her
son
paul
playing
near
her
yes
my
friend
said
she
have
come
down
to
await
my
guests
like
a
countrywoman
who
is
not
afraid
of
the
open
air
how
kind
of
you
to
accept
my
abrupt
invitation
she
smiled
at
him
while
offering
her
hand
she
was
not
pretty
but
she
was
charming
very
fair
and
small
with
a
delicate
round
head
curly
hair
and
eyes
of
a
soft
blue
her
husband
had
always
considered
her
to
be
somewhat
insignificant
never
suspecting
it
seemed
all
the
delightful
kindness
of
heart
and
sterling
good
sense
which
lurked
beneath
her
great
simplicity
luc
had
taken
her
hand
and
retained
it
for
a
moment
between
both
his
own
was
you
who
were
kind
to
think
of
me
i
am
very
very
pleased
to
meet
you
again
he
said
she
was
three
years
his
elder
and
had
first
met
him
in
a
wretched
house
in
the
rue
de
bercy
where
he
had
resided
when
beginning
life
as
an
assistant
engineer
at
some
adjacent
works
very
discreet
and
practising
charity
in
person
and
by
stealth
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
calling
at
this
house
to
see
a
mason
who
had
been
left
a
widower
with
six
children
two
of
them
little
girls
and
the
young
man
being
in
the
garret
with
these
little
girls
on
his
knees
one
evening
when
she
had
brought
some
food
and
linen
they
had
become
acquainted
luc
had
afterwards
had
occasion
to
visit
her
at
the
mansion
near
the
parc
monceau
in
connection
with
other
charitable
undertakings
in
which
they
were
both
interested
a
feeling
of
great
sympathy
had
then
gradually
drawn
them
together
and
he
had
become
her
assistant
and
messenger
in
matters
known
to
them
alone
thus
he
had
ended
by
visiting
the
mansion
regularly
being
invited
to
most
of
the
entertainments
there
during
two
successive
winters
and
it
was
there
too
that
he
had
first
met
the
jordans
you
only
knew
how
people
regret
you
how
your
departure
was
lamented
he
added
by
way
of
allusion
to
their
former
benevolent
alliance
suzanne
made
a
little
gesture
of
emotion
and
replied
in
a
low
voice
i
think
of
you
i
am
distressed
that
you
are
not
here
for
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
luc
however
had
just
noticed
paul
who
ran
up
with
some
wild
flowers
in
his
hand
and
the
young
man
burst
into
exclamations
at
seeing
how
much
the
boy
had
grown
very
fair
and
slim
he
had
a
gentle
smiling
face
and
greatly
resembled
his
mother
said
the
latter
gaily
will
now
soon
be
seven
years
old
he
is
already
a
little
man
seated
and
talking
together
like
brother
and
sister
in
the
warm
radiance
of
that
september
day
luc
and
suzanne
became
so
absorbed
in
their
happy
recollections
that
they
did
not
even
perceive
boisgelin
descend
the
steps
and
advance
towards
them
smart
of
mien
wearing
a
country
jacket
and
a
single
the
master
of
la
guerdache
was
a
brawny
coxcomb
with
grey
eyes
a
large
nose
and
waxed
moustaches
he
brought
his
dark
brown
hair
in
curls
over
his
narrow
brow
which
was
already
being
denuded
by
baldness
day
my
dear
froment
he
exclaimed
with
a
lisp
which
he
exaggerated
so
as
to
be
the
more
in
the
fashion
thousand
thanks
for
consenting
to
make
one
of
us
then
without
more
ado
after
a
vigorous
he
turned
to
his
wife
say
my
dear
i
hope
orders
were
given
to
send
the
victoria
to
delaveau
there
was
no
occasion
for
suzanne
to
reply
for
just
then
the
victoria
came
up
the
avenue
of
elms
and
the
delaveaus
alighted
before
the
stone
table
delaveau
was
a
short
man
possessing
a
head
massive
low
and
with
projecting
with
his
snub
nose
big
goggle
eyes
and
cheeks
half
hidden
by
a
thick
black
beard
he
carried
himself
in
a
military
authoritative
manner
a
delightful
contrast
was
presented
by
his
wife
fernande
a
tall
and
supple
brunette
with
blue
eyes
and
superb
shoulders
never
had
more
sumptuous
or
blacker
hair
crowned
a
more
pure
or
whiter
countenance
with
large
azure
eyes
of
glowing
tenderness
and
a
small
fresh
mouth
whose
little
teeth
seemed
to
be
of
unchangeable
brilliancy
and
strong
enough
to
break
pebbles
she
herself
however
was
proudest
of
her
delicately
shaped
feet
in
which
she
found
an
incontestable
proof
of
her
princely
origin
she
immediately
apologised
to
suzanne
whilst
making
a
maid
alight
with
her
daughter
nise
who
was
now
three
years
of
age
and
as
fair
as
her
mother
was
dark
having
a
curly
tumbled
head
eyes
blue
like
the
sky
and
a
pink
mouth
which
was
ever
laughing
dimpling
the
while
both
her
cheeks
and
her
chin
must
excuse
me
my
dear
said
fernande
i
profited
by
your
authorisation
to
bring
nise
you
have
done
quite
right
suzanne
responded
told
you
there
would
be
a
little
table
the
two
women
appeared
to
be
on
friendly
terms
one
could
scarcely
detect
a
slight
fluttering
of
suzanne
eyelids
when
she
saw
boisgelin
hasten
to
fernande
who
however
must
have
been
sulking
with
him
for
she
received
him
in
the
icy
manner
which
she
was
wont
to
assume
whenever
he
tried
to
escape
one
of
her
caprices
looking
somewhat
anxious
he
came
back
to
luc
and
delaveau
who
had
made
one
acquaintance
during
the
previous
spring
and
were
now
shaking
hands
together
nevertheless
the
young
man
presence
at
beauclair
seemed
somewhat
to
upset
the
manager
of
the
abyss
you
arrived
here
yesterday
of
course
then
you
did
not
find
jordan
at
home
since
he
was
so
suddenly
called
to
cannes
yes
yes
i
was
aware
of
that
but
i
did
not
know
that
he
had
sent
for
you
he
has
some
trouble
in
hand
with
respect
to
his
luc
was
surprised
at
the
other
keen
emotion
and
divined
that
he
was
about
to
ask
him
why
jordan
had
summoned
him
to
la
crÃªcherie
he
did
not
understand
the
reason
of
such
sudden
disquietude
and
so
he
answered
chancewise
do
you
think
so
everything
seems
to
be
going
on
all
right
however
delaveau
prudently
changed
the
subject
and
gave
boisgelin
some
good
news
china
said
he
had
just
purchased
a
stock
of
defective
shells
which
he
had
intended
to
recast
and
a
diversion
came
when
luc
who
was
extremely
fond
of
children
made
merry
on
seeing
paul
give
his
flowers
to
nise
who
was
his
very
particular
friend
a
pretty
little
girl
exclaimed
the
young
man
is
so
golden
that
she
looks
like
a
little
sun
how
is
it
possible
when
her
papa
and
mamma
are
so
dark
fernande
who
had
bowed
to
luc
while
giving
him
a
keen
glance
to
ascertain
if
he
were
likely
to
prove
a
friend
or
an
enemy
was
fond
of
having
such
questions
put
to
her
for
putting
on
a
glorious
air
she
invariably
replied
by
some
allusions
to
the
child
grandfather
the
famous
russian
prince
a
superbly
built
man
very
fair
and
i
am
sure
that
nise
will
be
the
very
image
of
him
by
this
time
boisgelin
had
apparently
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
the
correct
thing
to
await
one
guests
under
an
oak
tree
only
commonplace
after
retiring
from
business
into
the
country
could
venture
to
do
so
and
accordingly
he
led
the
whole
party
towards
the
at
that
moment
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
made
his
appearance
in
his
little
conveyance
propelled
by
a
servant
the
old
man
had
insisted
on
living
quite
apart
from
the
other
inmates
of
la
guerdache
he
had
his
own
hours
for
rising
going
to
bed
and
going
out
and
he
invariably
took
his
meals
by
himself
he
would
not
let
the
others
occupy
themselves
with
him
and
indeed
it
was
an
established
rule
in
the
house
that
he
should
not
even
be
spoken
to
thus
when
he
suddenly
appeared
before
them
they
contented
themselves
with
bowing
in
silence
suzanne
alone
smiling
and
giving
him
a
long
and
affectionate
glance
on
his
side
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
who
was
starting
on
one
of
those
long
promenades
which
at
times
kept
him
out
of
doors
the
whole
afternoon
gazed
at
the
others
fixedly
like
some
forgotten
onlooker
who
has
ceased
to
belong
to
the
world
and
no
longer
responds
to
salutations
and
beneath
the
cold
keenness
of
the
old
man
stare
luc
felt
his
uneasiness
his
torturing
doubts
return
the
was
a
rich
and
extremely
large
apartment
hung
with
red
brocatelle
and
furnished
sumptuously
in
the
style
the
party
had
scarcely
entered
it
when
some
other
guests
arrived
chÃ¢telard
followed
by
mayor
gourier
the
latter
wife
lÃ©onore
and
their
son
achille
chÃ¢telard
who
at
forty
could
still
claim
to
be
a
man
was
bald
with
an
aquiline
nose
a
discreet
mouth
and
large
eyes
which
shone
keenly
behind
the
glasses
he
wore
he
was
a
piece
of
parisian
wreckage
who
after
losing
his
hair
and
his
digestion
in
the
capital
had
secured
the
of
beauclair
as
an
asylum
thanks
to
an
intimate
friend
who
had
been
pitchforked
into
office
as
a
minister
of
state
deficient
in
ambition
suffering
from
a
liver
complaint
and
realising
the
necessity
of
rest
he
had
fallen
upon
pleasant
lines
there
through
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
beautiful
madame
gourier
with
whom
he
carried
on
an
unclouded
which
was
favourably
viewed
by
those
he
governed
and
even
accepted
it
was
said
by
the
lady
husband
the
latter
thoughts
being
given
elsewhere
lÃ©onore
was
still
a
woman
at
fair
with
large
regular
features
and
she
outwardly
displayed
extreme
piety
prudishness
and
coldness
though
according
to
some
accounts
an
everlasting
brazier
of
passions
blazed
within
her
gourier
a
fat
man
ruddy
with
a
swollen
neck
and
a
face
spoke
of
his
wife
with
an
indulgent
smile
he
paid
far
more
attention
to
the
girls
of
his
boot
factory
which
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
and
in
which
he
had
personally
made
a
fortune
the
only
remaining
tie
between
his
wife
and
himself
was
their
son
achille
a
youth
of
eighteen
who
although
he
was
very
dark
had
his
regular
features
and
fine
eyes
and
evinced
an
amount
of
intelligence
and
independence
which
confounded
and
annoyed
both
his
parents
on
whatever
terms
they
themselves
lived
together
they
at
all
events
showed
perfect
agreement
in
the
presence
of
strangers
and
indeed
since
chÃ¢telard
had
made
their
acquaintance
the
happiness
of
their
household
was
cited
as
an
example
moreover
the
administration
of
the
town
was
greatly
facilitated
by
the
close
intercourse
that
prevailed
between
the
and
the
mayor
but
other
guests
were
now
arriving
for
instance
judge
gaume
accompanied
by
his
daughter
lucile
and
followed
by
the
betrothed
jollivet
a
captain
on
the
retired
list
gaume
a
man
with
a
long
head
a
lofty
brow
and
a
fleshy
chin
was
barely
but
seemed
desirous
of
remaining
forgotten
in
that
nook
beauclair
on
account
of
the
terrible
tragedy
which
had
wrecked
his
life
his
wife
forsaken
by
a
lover
had
one
evening
killed
herself
before
him
after
confessing
her
fault
and
however
frigid
and
severe
the
judge
might
seem
to
be
he
had
really
remained
inconsolable
tortured
by
that
terrible
catastrophe
and
at
the
present
time
full
of
fears
for
the
future
of
his
daughter
to
whom
he
was
extremely
attached
and
who
as
she
grew
up
had
become
more
and
more
like
her
mother
short
and
slight
and
refined
and
of
an
amorous
disposition
with
melting
eyes
set
in
a
bright
face
crowned
with
hair
of
a
hue
lucile
ever
reminded
her
father
of
her
transgression
and
for
fear
lest
something
similar
should
happen
to
her
he
had
betrothed
her
as
soon
as
she
was
twenty
to
captain
jollivet
though
he
realised
in
doing
so
that
it
would
be
painful
for
him
to
part
with
her
and
that
he
would
afterwards
sink
into
bitter
solitude
captain
jollivet
though
he
looked
rather
worn
for
a
man
only
years
old
was
none
the
less
a
handsome
fellow
with
a
stubborn
brow
and
victorious
moustaches
fever
contracted
in
madagascar
had
compelled
him
to
send
in
his
papers
and
having
just
then
inherited
an
income
of
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
he
had
decided
to
establish
himself
at
beauclair
his
native
place
and
marry
lucile
whose
cooing
ways
had
quite
upset
him
gaume
who
had
no
fortune
of
his
own
and
lived
poorly
on
his
pay
as
a
presiding
judge
could
not
decline
the
proposals
of
such
a
suitor
yet
his
secret
despair
seemed
to
increase
for
never
had
he
evinced
more
severity
in
applying
the
law
rigorously
following
the
strict
stern
wording
of
the
code
people
said
however
that
implacable
as
he
might
seem
to
be
he
was
really
a
disheartened
man
a
disconsolate
pessimist
who
doubted
everything
and
particularly
human
justice
if
that
were
true
what
must
have
been
his
sufferings
the
sufferings
of
a
judge
who
while
asking
himself
if
he
has
any
right
to
do
so
passes
sentences
on
unhappy
wretches
who
are
really
the
victims
of
everybody
crime
soon
after
the
gaumes
came
the
mazelles
with
their
daughter
louise
a
child
three
years
of
age
another
guest
for
the
little
table
these
mazelles
were
a
perfectly
happy
couple
two
stout
folks
of
the
same
age
that
is
little
more
than
forty
and
they
had
grown
so
much
alike
in
course
of
time
that
each
now
had
the
same
rosy
smiling
face
the
same
gentle
parental
way
as
the
other
they
had
spent
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
install
themselves
in
true
fashion
in
a
fine
substantial
house
surrounded
by
a
fairly
large
garden
near
the
and
they
lived
therein
on
an
income
of
some
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
derived
from
investments
in
rentes
which
to
their
fancy
alone
seemed
safe
their
happiness
the
beatitude
of
their
life
which
was
now
spent
in
doing
nothing
had
become
proverbial
often
were
people
heard
to
say
if
one
could
only
be
like
monsieur
mazelle
who
does
nothing
he
lucky
and
no
mistake
to
this
he
answered
that
he
had
worked
hard
during
ten
years
and
was
fully
entitled
to
his
fortune
the
fact
was
that
after
beginning
life
as
a
petty
commission
agent
in
the
coal
trade
he
had
found
a
bride
with
a
dowry
of
fifty
thousand
francs
and
had
been
skilful
or
perhaps
simply
lucky
enough
to
foresee
the
strikes
whose
frequent
recurrence
over
a
period
of
nearly
ten
years
were
destined
to
bring
about
a
considerable
rise
in
the
prices
of
french
coal
his
great
stroke
had
consisted
in
making
sure
at
the
lowest
possible
prices
of
some
very
large
stocks
of
coal
abroad
and
in
them
at
a
huge
profit
to
french
manufacturers
when
a
sudden
failure
in
their
own
supplies
was
forcing
them
to
close
their
works
at
the
same
time
mazelle
had
shown
himself
a
perfect
sage
retiring
from
business
when
he
was
nearly
forty
that
is
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
possession
of
the
six
hundred
thousand
francs
which
according
to
his
calculation
would
ensure
his
wife
and
himself
a
life
of
perfect
felicity
he
had
not
even
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
trying
to
make
a
million
for
he
was
far
too
much
afraid
that
fortune
might
play
him
false
and
never
had
egotism
triumphed
more
serenely
never
had
optimism
a
greater
right
to
say
that
everything
was
for
the
best
in
the
best
of
worlds
than
in
the
case
of
these
perfectly
worthy
people
who
were
very
fond
of
one
another
and
of
that
tardy
arrival
their
little
girl
fully
satisfied
free
from
all
feverishness
having
no
further
ambition
to
satisfy
they
presented
a
perfect
picture
of
happiness
the
happiness
which
shuts
itself
up
and
does
not
even
glance
at
the
unhappiness
of
others
the
only
little
flaw
in
this
happiness
lay
in
the
circumstance
that
madame
mazelle
a
very
plump
and
blooming
dame
imagined
that
she
was
afflicted
with
some
serious
nameless
undefinable
complaint
on
which
account
she
was
all
the
more
coddled
by
her
husband
who
spoke
with
a
kind
of
tender
vanity
about
wife
illness
in
the
same
way
as
he
might
have
spoken
of
wife
wonderful
golden
hair
withal
this
supposed
illness
gave
rise
to
no
sadness
or
fear
and
it
was
simply
with
astonishment
that
the
worthy
couple
contemplated
their
little
girl
louise
who
was
growing
up
so
unlike
either
of
them
that
is
dark
thin
and
quick
with
an
amusing
little
head
which
with
its
obliquely
set
eyes
and
slender
nose
suggested
that
of
a
young
goat
this
astonishment
of
theirs
was
rapturous
as
if
the
child
had
fallen
from
heaven
as
a
present
to
bring
a
little
life
into
their
sunshiny
house
which
fell
asleep
so
easily
during
their
long
hours
of
placid
digestion
beauclair
society
willingly
made
fun
of
the
mazelles
comparing
them
to
pullets
in
a
fattening
pen
but
it
none
the
less
respected
them
bowed
to
them
and
invited
them
to
its
entertainments
for
with
their
fortune
which
was
so
safe
and
substantial
they
reigned
over
the
workers
the
poorly
paid
officials
and
even
the
millionaire
capitalists
since
the
latter
were
always
liable
to
some
catastrophe
at
last
the
only
other
guest
expected
at
la
guerdache
that
day
abbÃ©
marle
the
rector
of
vincent
the
rich
parish
of
beauclair
arrived
none
too
soon
however
for
the
others
were
about
to
enter
the
he
apologised
for
being
late
saying
that
his
duties
had
detained
him
he
was
a
tall
strong
man
with
a
face
a
nose
and
a
large
firm
mouth
still
young
only
he
would
willingly
have
battled
for
the
faith
had
it
not
been
for
a
slight
impediment
of
speech
which
rendered
preaching
difficult
this
explained
why
he
was
resigned
to
burying
himself
alive
at
beauclair
the
expression
of
his
dark
stubborn
eyes
alone
testified
to
his
past
dream
of
a
militant
career
he
was
not
without
intelligence
he
perfectly
understood
the
crisis
through
which
catholicism
was
passing
and
whilst
preserving
silence
with
respect
to
the
fears
which
he
sometimes
experienced
when
he
saw
his
church
deserted
by
the
masses
he
clung
strictly
to
the
letter
of
the
dogmas
feeling
certain
that
the
whole
of
the
ancient
edifice
would
be
swept
away
should
science
and
the
spirit
of
free
examination
ever
effect
a
breach
in
it
moreover
he
accepted
the
invitations
to
la
guerdache
without
any
illusions
concerning
the
virtues
of
the
indeed
he
lunched
and
dined
there
in
some
measure
from
a
spirit
of
duty
in
order
to
hide
the
sores
whose
existence
he
divined
there
under
the
cloak
of
religion
luc
was
delighted
with
the
gay
brightness
and
pleasant
luxuriousness
of
the
spacious
which
occupied
one
end
of
the
ground
floor
and
had
a
number
of
large
windows
overlooking
the
lawns
and
trees
of
the
park
all
that
verdure
seemed
to
belong
to
the
room
which
with
its
woodwork
and
hangings
of
a
soft
became
like
the
of
some
idyllic
and
the
richness
of
the
table
the
whiteness
of
the
napery
the
blaze
of
the
silver
and
crystal
the
flowers
too
spread
over
the
board
were
a
festival
for
the
eyes
amidst
a
wondrous
setting
of
light
and
perfume
so
keenly
was
luc
impressed
by
it
all
that
his
experiences
on
the
previous
evening
suddenly
arose
before
his
mind
eyes
and
he
pictured
the
black
and
hungry
toilers
tramping
through
the
mud
of
the
rue
de
brias
the
puddlers
and
drawers
roasting
themselves
before
the
hellish
flames
of
the
furnaces
and
particularly
bonnaire
in
his
wretched
home
and
the
woeful
josine
seated
on
the
stairs
saved
from
starving
that
night
thanks
to
the
loaf
which
her
little
brother
had
stolen
how
much
unjust
misery
there
was
and
on
what
accursed
toil
what
hateful
suffering
was
based
the
luxury
of
the
idle
and
the
happy
at
table
where
covers
were
laid
for
fifteen
luc
found
himself
placed
between
fernande
and
delaveau
contrary
to
proper
usage
boisgelin
who
had
madame
mazelle
on
his
right
had
placed
fernande
on
his
left
he
ought
to
have
assigned
that
seat
to
madame
gourier
but
in
friendly
houses
it
was
understood
that
lÃ©onore
ought
always
to
be
placed
near
her
friend
chÃ¢telard
the
latter
naturally
occupied
the
place
of
honour
on
suzanne
right
hand
judge
gaume
being
on
her
left
as
for
abbÃ©
marle
he
had
been
placed
next
to
lÃ©onore
his
most
assiduous
and
preferred
penitent
then
the
betrothed
couple
captain
jollivet
and
lucile
sat
at
one
end
of
the
table
facing
young
achille
gourier
who
at
the
other
end
remained
silent
between
delaveau
and
the
abbÃ©
and
suzanne
full
of
foresight
had
given
orders
for
the
little
table
to
be
set
behind
her
so
that
she
might
be
near
to
watch
it
paul
presided
over
it
between
nise
and
louise
who
both
behaved
in
a
somewhat
disquieting
fashion
for
their
little
paws
were
continually
straying
over
the
plates
and
into
the
glasses
luckily
a
maid
remained
beside
them
while
at
the
larger
table
the
waiting
was
done
by
the
two
valets
whom
the
coachman
assisted
as
soon
as
the
scrambled
eggs
accompanied
by
sauterne
had
been
served
a
general
conversation
was
started
reference
was
made
to
the
bread
supplied
by
the
beauclair
bakers
was
impossible
for
me
to
get
used
to
it
said
boisgelin
fancy
bread
is
uneatable
so
i
get
mine
from
paris
he
said
this
in
the
simplest
manner
possible
but
they
all
glanced
with
vague
respect
at
their
rolls
however
the
unpleasant
occurrences
of
the
previous
evening
still
haunted
every
mind
and
fernande
exclaimed
the
way
do
you
know
that
they
pillaged
a
baker
shop
in
the
rue
de
brias
last
night
luc
could
not
help
laughing
madame
pillaged
said
he
was
there
it
was
simply
a
wretched
child
who
stole
a
loaf
were
there
too
declared
captain
jollivet
ruffled
by
the
compassionate
excusing
tone
of
the
young
man
voice
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
the
child
was
not
arrested
at
least
for
sake
doubt
no
doubt
boisgelin
resumed
seems
that
there
has
been
a
lot
of
thievery
since
that
wretched
strike
i
have
been
told
of
a
woman
who
broke
open
a
butcher
till
all
the
tradespeople
complain
that
prowlers
fill
their
pockets
with
things
set
out
for
sale
and
so
our
beautiful
new
prison
is
now
receiving
tenants
is
that
not
so
monsieur
le
prÃ©sident
gaume
was
about
to
answer
when
the
captain
violently
resumed
theft
unpunished
begets
pillage
and
murder
the
spirit
predominating
among
the
population
is
becoming
something
frightful
some
of
you
were
out
in
the
town
yesterday
evening
like
i
was
you
notice
that
spirit
of
revolt
of
passing
menace
a
kind
of
terror
that
made
the
town
tremble
besides
that
anarchist
lange
did
not
hesitate
to
tell
you
what
he
intended
doing
he
shouted
that
he
would
blow
up
beauclair
and
sweep
away
the
ruins
as
he
at
any
rate
is
under
lock
and
key
i
hope
that
he
will
be
sharply
looked
after
jollivet
outspokenness
astonished
everybody
what
was
the
use
of
recalling
that
gust
of
terror
of
which
he
spoke
and
which
the
others
like
himself
had
felt
passing
why
revive
it
as
it
were
at
that
pleasant
table
laden
with
such
nice
and
beautiful
things
a
chill
spread
round
the
threat
of
what
the
morrow
might
bring
forth
resounded
in
the
ears
of
all
those
nervous
amidst
the
deep
silence
whilst
the
valets
came
and
went
offering
trout
realising
that
the
silence
was
embarrassing
everybody
delaveau
at
last
exclaimed
shows
a
detestable
spirit
the
captain
right
as
the
rascal
is
under
lock
and
key
he
should
be
kept
there
but
judge
gaume
was
wagging
his
head
at
last
in
his
severe
way
his
countenance
quite
rigid
in
such
wise
that
one
could
not
tell
what
might
lurk
behind
his
professional
stiffness
he
retorted
must
inform
you
that
this
morning
the
investigating
magistrate
acting
on
my
advice
after
subjecting
the
man
to
a
simple
interrogatory
made
up
his
mind
to
release
him
protests
arose
concealing
real
fear
beneath
humorous
exaggeration
do
you
want
us
all
to
be
murdered
then
monsieur
le
prÃ©sident
gaume
replied
by
slowly
waving
his
hand
a
gesture
which
might
mean
many
things
after
all
the
wise
course
was
certainly
to
refrain
from
imparting
by
some
uproarious
trial
at
law
any
excessive
importance
to
the
words
which
lange
had
cast
to
the
winds
for
the
more
those
words
were
spread
the
more
would
they
bear
fruit
jollivet
who
had
calmed
down
sat
gnawing
his
moustaches
for
he
did
not
wish
to
contradict
his
future
openly
but
chÃ¢telard
who
had
hitherto
contented
himself
with
smiling
in
the
affable
way
of
a
man
who
puts
faith
in
nothing
exclaimed
i
quite
understand
your
views
monsieur
le
prÃ©sident
what
you
have
done
is
in
my
opinion
excellent
policy
the
spirit
of
the
masses
is
not
worse
at
beauclair
than
it
is
elsewhere
that
spirit
is
everywhere
the
same
one
must
strive
to
accustom
oneself
to
it
and
the
proper
course
is
to
prolong
the
present
state
of
things
as
much
as
possible
for
it
seems
certain
that
when
a
change
comes
it
will
be
for
the
worse
luc
fancied
that
he
could
detect
some
jeering
irony
in
the
words
and
manner
of
that
of
paris
who
was
doubtless
amused
by
the
covert
terror
of
the
provincial
around
him
moreover
chÃ¢telard
practical
policy
was
summed
up
entirely
in
what
he
had
said
apart
from
that
he
evinced
superb
indifference
no
matter
what
minister
might
be
in
office
the
old
government
machine
continued
working
from
force
of
acquired
motion
there
was
grating
and
there
were
jolts
and
things
would
fall
to
pieces
and
crumble
into
dust
as
soon
as
the
new
social
system
might
appear
there
would
be
a
nasty
tumble
at
the
end
of
the
journey
as
chÃ¢telard
laughing
was
wont
to
say
among
his
intimates
the
machine
rolled
on
because
it
was
wound
up
but
at
the
first
really
serious
jolt
it
would
go
to
the
deuce
even
the
vain
efforts
that
were
attempted
to
strengthen
the
crazy
old
coach
the
timid
reforms
which
were
essayed
the
useless
new
laws
which
men
voted
without
even
daring
to
put
the
old
ones
into
force
the
furious
surging
of
ambitions
and
personalities
the
wild
rageful
battling
of
parties
were
only
calculated
to
aggravate
and
hasten
the
supreme
agony
such
a
must
feel
astonished
every
morning
at
finding
itself
still
erect
and
must
say
to
itself
that
the
downfall
would
surely
occur
on
the
morrow
he
chÃ¢telard
being
in
no
wise
a
fool
arranged
matters
so
as
to
last
as
long
as
the
did
a
prudent
republican
as
it
was
needful
to
be
he
represented
the
government
just
sufficiently
to
retain
his
post
doing
only
what
was
necessary
and
desiring
above
all
things
to
live
in
peace
with
those
under
his
jurisdiction
and
if
everything
should
topple
over
he
at
all
events
would
try
not
to
be
under
the
ruins
see
very
well
he
concluded
the
unfortunate
strike
which
rendered
us
all
so
anxious
has
ended
in
the
best
manner
possible
mayor
gourier
was
not
endowed
with
the
caustic
philosophy
although
as
a
rule
they
agreed
together
in
such
wise
as
to
facilitate
the
administration
of
the
town
he
now
protested
me
allow
me
my
dear
friend
too
many
concessions
might
carry
us
a
long
way
i
know
the
working
classes
i
am
fond
of
them
i
am
an
old
republican
a
democrat
of
the
early
days
but
if
i
grant
the
workers
the
right
to
improve
their
lot
i
will
never
accept
the
subversive
theories
those
ideas
of
the
collectivists
which
would
bring
all
civilised
society
to
an
end
in
his
loud
but
trembling
voice
rang
out
the
fears
which
he
had
lately
experienced
the
ferocity
of
a
threatened
the
innate
desire
for
repression
which
had
at
one
moment
displayed
itself
in
a
desire
to
summon
the
military
in
order
that
the
strikers
might
be
forced
to
resume
work
under
the
penalty
of
being
shot
for
my
part
i
done
everything
for
the
workpeople
at
my
factory
he
continued
got
relief
funds
pension
funds
cheap
dwellings
every
advantage
imaginable
so
what
more
can
they
want
it
seems
as
if
the
world
were
coming
to
an
end
is
that
not
so
monsieur
delaveau
the
manager
of
the
abyss
had
so
far
continued
eating
ravenously
and
listening
scarcely
taking
part
in
the
conversation
coming
to
an
end
said
he
in
his
quiet
energetic
manner
certainly
hope
that
we
allow
the
world
to
end
without
fighting
a
little
to
make
it
last
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
as
monsieur
le
the
strike
has
ended
very
well
and
i
have
even
had
some
good
news
bonnaire
the
collectivist
the
leader
whom
i
was
compelled
to
take
back
has
done
justice
to
himself
he
quitted
the
works
last
night
he
is
an
excellent
workman
no
doubt
but
he
a
dangerous
dreamer
and
it
is
dreaming
that
leads
one
to
precipices
he
went
on
talking
striving
to
appear
very
loyal
and
just
each
had
a
right
to
defend
his
own
interests
by
going
out
on
strike
the
workmen
fancied
that
they
were
serving
their
interests
he
as
manager
of
the
works
defended
the
capital
the
plant
the
property
entrusted
to
him
and
he
was
willing
to
show
some
indulgence
since
he
felt
himself
to
be
the
stronger
his
one
duty
was
simply
to
maintain
what
existed
the
working
of
the
such
as
it
had
been
organised
by
the
wisdom
born
of
experience
all
practical
truth
centred
in
that
apart
from
it
there
were
but
criminal
dreams
such
as
that
collectivism
the
enforcement
of
which
would
have
brought
about
the
most
frightful
catastrophes
he
also
spoke
of
workmen
unions
and
syndicates
which
he
resisted
energetically
for
he
divined
that
they
might
prove
a
powerful
engine
of
war
at
the
same
time
he
triumphed
like
an
active
manager
who
was
well
pleased
that
the
strike
had
not
caused
greater
ravages
or
become
a
positive
disaster
in
such
wise
as
to
prevent
him
from
carrying
out
his
engagements
with
his
cousin
that
year
just
then
the
two
valets
were
handing
round
some
roast
partridges
whilst
the
coachman
acting
as
butler
offered
some
Ã©milion
so
said
boisgelin
in
a
bantering
way
promise
me
that
we
be
reduced
to
potatoes
and
that
we
may
eat
those
partridges
without
any
twinges
of
remorse
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
greeted
this
jest
which
was
deemed
extremely
witty
promise
it
gaily
said
delaveau
who
laughed
like
the
others
may
eat
and
sleep
in
peace
the
revolution
which
is
to
carry
away
your
income
wo
take
place
luc
who
remained
silent
could
feel
his
heart
beating
that
was
indeed
the
position
the
wage
system
the
capitalist
exploiting
the
labour
of
the
others
he
advanced
five
francs
made
them
produce
seven
francs
by
making
the
workmen
toil
and
spent
the
two
francs
profit
at
least
however
that
man
delaveau
worked
exerted
his
brain
and
his
muscles
but
by
what
right
did
boisgelin
who
had
never
done
anything
live
and
eat
in
such
luxury
luc
was
struck
too
by
the
demeanour
of
fernande
who
sat
beside
him
she
appeared
to
be
greatly
interested
in
that
conversation
though
it
seemed
little
suited
to
women
she
grew
both
excited
and
delighted
over
the
defeat
of
the
toilers
and
the
victory
of
that
wealth
which
she
devoured
like
the
young
wolf
she
was
her
red
lips
curved
over
displaying
her
sharp
teeth
while
she
laughed
the
laugh
of
cruelty
as
if
indeed
she
were
at
last
satisfying
her
rancour
and
her
cravings
in
front
of
the
gentle
woman
whom
she
was
deceiving
between
her
foppish
lover
whom
she
dominated
and
her
blind
husband
who
was
gaining
future
millions
for
her
she
seemed
to
be
already
intoxicated
by
the
flowers
the
wines
and
the
viands
intoxicated
especially
by
perverse
delight
at
employing
her
radiant
beauty
to
bring
disorder
and
destruction
into
that
home
there
some
question
of
a
charity
bazaar
at
the
asked
suzanne
of
chÃ¢telard
in
a
soft
voice
we
talk
of
something
else
besides
politics
the
gallant
immediately
adhered
to
her
views
certainly
it
is
unpardonable
on
our
part
i
will
give
every
you
may
desire
dear
madame
from
that
moment
the
general
conversation
ceased
each
reverted
to
his
or
her
favourite
subject
abbÃ©
marle
had
contented
himself
with
nodding
approvingly
in
response
to
certain
declarations
made
by
delaveau
the
priest
behaved
with
great
prudence
in
that
circle
for
he
was
distressed
by
the
misconduct
of
boisgelin
the
scepticism
of
the
and
the
open
hostility
of
the
mayor
who
made
a
parade
of
ideas
ah
how
the
abbÃ©
gorge
rose
at
the
thought
of
that
social
system
which
he
was
called
upon
to
support
and
which
ended
in
such
a
his
only
consolation
was
the
devout
sympathy
of
lÃ©onore
who
sat
beside
him
muttering
pretty
phrases
whilst
the
others
argued
she
likewise
transgressed
but
at
least
she
confessed
her
faults
and
he
could
already
picture
her
at
the
tribunal
of
penitence
accusing
herself
of
having
derived
too
much
pleasure
at
that
lunch
from
the
attentions
of
chÃ¢telard
who
sat
on
her
other
hand
like
the
priest
worthy
monsieur
mazelle
who
remained
almost
forgotten
between
judge
gaume
and
captain
jollivet
had
only
opened
his
mouth
to
take
in
quantities
of
food
which
he
chewed
very
slowly
owing
to
his
fears
of
indigestion
political
matters
no
longer
interested
him
since
thanks
to
his
income
he
had
placed
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
storms
nevertheless
he
was
compelled
to
lend
ear
to
the
theories
of
the
captain
who
was
eager
to
pour
forth
his
feelings
on
such
a
quiet
listener
the
army
so
the
captain
said
was
the
school
of
the
country
france
in
accordance
with
her
immutable
traditions
could
only
be
a
warlike
nation
and
would
only
recover
equilibrium
when
she
reconquered
europe
and
reigned
by
force
of
arms
it
was
stupid
of
people
to
accuse
military
service
of
disorganising
labour
what
labour
whose
labour
indeed
did
anything
of
that
exist
socialism
why
it
was
a
stupendous
farce
there
would
always
be
soldiers
and
down
below
there
must
be
people
to
do
the
fatigue
duties
a
sabre
could
at
any
rate
be
seen
but
who
had
ever
seen
the
idea
that
famous
idea
the
pretended
queen
of
the
earth
the
captain
laughed
at
his
own
wit
and
worthy
mazelle
who
felt
profound
respect
for
the
army
complacently
laughed
with
him
whilst
lucile
his
betrothed
examined
him
in
silence
with
the
glances
of
an
enigmatical
smiling
faintly
and
strangely
the
while
as
if
amused
to
think
what
a
husband
he
would
make
meantime
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
young
achille
gourier
immured
himself
in
the
silence
of
a
witness
and
a
judge
his
eyes
gleaming
with
all
the
contempt
which
he
felt
for
his
parents
and
the
friends
with
whom
they
compelled
him
to
take
lunch
however
at
the
moment
when
a
of
ducks
liver
a
perfect
marvel
was
being
served
another
voice
arose
and
was
heard
by
everybody
it
was
that
of
madame
mazelle
hitherto
silent
busy
with
her
plate
and
her
mysterious
complaint
which
required
ample
nourishment
finding
herself
neglected
by
boisgelin
whose
attention
was
given
entirely
to
fernande
she
had
ultimately
fallen
on
gourier
to
whom
she
gave
particulars
about
her
home
her
perfect
agreement
with
her
husband
and
her
ideas
of
the
manner
in
which
she
meant
to
have
her
daughter
louise
educated
wo
let
them
worry
her
brain
ah
no
indeed
why
should
she
worry
she
an
only
child
she
will
inherit
all
our
rentes
all
at
once
without
reflecting
luc
yielded
to
his
desire
to
protest
do
you
know
madame
said
he
they
are
going
to
suppress
the
right
of
inheritance
oh
yes
very
soon
directly
the
new
social
system
is
organised
all
round
the
table
it
was
thought
that
he
was
jesting
and
madame
mazelle
stupefaction
was
so
comical
to
behold
that
everybody
helped
on
the
joke
the
right
of
inheritance
suppressed
how
infamous
what
the
money
earned
by
the
father
would
be
taken
from
the
children
and
they
in
their
turn
would
have
to
earn
their
own
bread
why
yes
of
course
that
was
the
logical
outcome
of
collectivism
mazelle
quite
scared
by
it
all
came
to
his
wife
help
saying
that
he
did
not
feel
anxious
for
his
whole
fortune
was
invested
in
state
rentes
and
nobody
would
ever
dare
to
touch
the
national
ledgers
just
where
you
make
a
mistake
monsieur
luc
quietly
resumed
national
ledgers
will
be
burnt
and
rentes
will
be
abolished
it
is
already
resolved
upon
at
this
the
mazelles
nearly
suffocated
rentes
abolished
it
seemed
to
them
that
this
was
as
impossible
as
the
fall
of
the
sky
upon
their
heads
and
they
were
so
distracted
so
terrified
by
the
threat
of
such
an
inversion
of
the
laws
of
nature
that
chÃ¢telard
decided
to
reassure
them
turning
slightly
towards
the
little
table
where
in
spite
of
paul
fine
example
the
little
girls
nise
and
louise
had
not
behaved
particularly
well
he
said
in
a
bantering
fashion
no
all
that
wo
happen
your
little
girl
will
have
time
to
grow
up
and
have
children
of
her
own
only
it
will
be
as
well
to
clean
her
for
i
fancy
that
she
has
been
dipping
her
face
in
the
whipped
cream
they
went
on
jesting
and
laughing
yet
one
and
all
had
felt
the
great
breath
of
passing
the
breeze
of
the
future
blowing
across
the
table
whence
it
swept
away
iniquitous
luxury
and
poisonous
enjoyment
and
they
all
rushed
to
the
help
of
rentes
and
capital
the
and
capitalist
society
based
upon
the
wage
system
republic
will
kill
itself
on
the
day
it
touches
property
said
mayor
gourier
are
laws
and
everything
would
crumble
to
pieces
on
the
day
they
might
cease
to
be
enforced
said
judge
gaume
it
the
army
there
at
all
events
and
the
army
wo
allow
the
rogues
to
triumph
said
captain
jollivet
god
act
he
is
all
kindness
and
justice
said
abbÃ©
marle
boisgelin
and
delaveau
contented
themselves
with
approving
for
it
was
to
their
help
that
all
the
social
forces
hastened
and
luc
understood
the
position
clearly
it
was
the
government
the
administration
the
magistracy
the
army
the
clergy
which
sustained
the
decaying
social
system
the
monstrous
structure
of
iniquity
in
which
the
murderous
toil
of
the
greater
number
fed
the
corrupting
sloth
of
the
few
this
was
another
phase
of
the
terrible
vision
which
he
had
beheld
the
previous
day
after
gazing
upon
the
rear
he
now
saw
the
front
of
that
rotting
social
edifice
which
was
collapsing
upon
every
side
and
even
here
amidst
all
that
luxury
and
those
triumphal
surroundings
he
had
again
heard
it
cracking
he
could
detect
that
those
people
were
all
anxious
but
strove
to
forget
and
to
divert
their
minds
whilst
rushing
on
towards
the
precipice
the
dessert
was
now
being
served
and
the
table
was
covered
with
pastry
and
magnificent
fruit
the
better
to
bring
back
the
good
spirits
of
the
mazelles
the
others
as
soon
as
the
champagne
was
poured
out
began
to
sing
the
praises
of
idleness
divine
idleness
which
belongs
not
to
this
world
and
then
luc
as
he
continued
reflecting
suddenly
understood
what
it
was
that
weighed
upon
his
mind
it
was
the
problem
of
how
the
future
might
be
freed
in
presence
of
those
folks
who
represented
the
unjust
and
tyrannical
authority
of
the
past
after
coffee
which
was
served
in
the
boisgelin
suggested
a
stroll
through
the
park
as
far
as
the
farm
throughout
the
repast
he
had
been
prodigal
in
his
attentions
to
fernande
but
she
still
gave
him
the
cold
shoulder
refraining
even
from
answering
him
and
reserving
her
bright
smiles
for
the
seated
in
front
of
her
matters
had
been
like
this
for
a
week
past
and
were
always
so
when
he
did
not
immediately
satisfy
one
of
her
caprices
the
real
cause
of
their
present
quarrel
was
that
she
had
insisted
on
his
giving
a
for
the
sole
delight
of
showing
herself
at
it
in
a
new
and
appropriate
costume
he
had
taken
the
liberty
to
refuse
as
the
expenses
would
be
very
great
and
moreover
suzanne
having
been
warned
of
the
matter
had
begged
him
to
be
a
little
reasonable
thus
a
struggle
had
ended
by
breaking
out
between
the
two
women
and
it
was
a
question
which
of
them
would
win
the
victory
the
wife
or
the
other
during
lunch
suzanne
sad
and
gentle
eyes
had
missed
nothing
of
fernande
affected
coldness
and
her
husband
anxious
attentions
and
so
when
the
latter
proposed
a
stroll
she
understood
that
he
was
simply
seeking
an
opportunity
to
be
alone
with
her
sulky
rival
in
order
to
defend
himself
and
win
her
back
greatly
hurt
by
this
but
incapable
of
battling
suzanne
sought
refuge
in
her
suffering
dignity
saying
that
she
should
remain
indoors
in
order
to
keep
the
mazelles
company
for
they
from
considerations
of
health
never
bestirred
themselves
on
leaving
table
judge
gaume
his
daughter
lucile
and
captain
jollivet
also
declared
that
they
should
not
go
out
and
this
led
to
abbÃ©
marle
proposing
to
play
the
judge
a
game
of
chess
young
achille
gourier
had
already
taken
leave
under
pretext
that
he
was
preparing
for
an
examination
but
in
reality
to
indulge
freely
in
his
favourite
reveries
as
he
strolled
about
the
country
and
so
only
boisgelin
the
the
delaveaus
the
gouriers
and
luc
repaired
to
the
farm
walking
slowly
towards
it
under
the
lofty
trees
on
the
way
thither
things
passed
off
very
correctly
the
five
men
walked
on
together
whilst
fernande
and
lÃ©onore
brought
up
the
rear
deep
apparently
in
some
confidential
chat
among
the
men
boisgelin
had
now
begun
to
bewail
the
misfortunes
of
agriculture
the
soil
was
becoming
bankrupt
said
he
and
all
who
tilled
it
were
hastening
to
ruin
chÃ¢telard
and
gourier
agreed
that
the
terrible
problem
for
which
no
solution
had
hitherto
been
found
lay
in
the
direction
of
agriculture
for
in
order
that
the
industrial
workman
might
produce
it
was
necessary
that
bread
should
be
cheap
and
if
corn
fetched
only
a
low
price
the
peasant
reduced
to
beggary
could
no
longer
purchase
the
products
of
industry
delaveau
for
his
part
believed
that
a
solution
might
be
found
in
an
intelligent
system
of
protection
as
for
luc
who
took
a
passionate
interest
in
the
matter
he
did
his
utmost
to
make
the
others
talk
and
boisgelin
ended
by
confessing
that
his
own
despair
came
largely
from
the
continual
difficulties
that
he
had
with
his
farmer
feuillat
whose
demands
increased
year
by
year
he
would
doubtless
have
to
part
with
the
man
when
the
renewal
of
the
lease
was
discussed
for
the
farmer
had
asked
for
a
reduction
of
terms
amounting
to
no
less
than
ten
per
cent
the
worst
was
that
fearing
his
lease
might
not
be
renewed
he
had
ceased
to
take
proper
care
of
the
land
which
he
no
longer
manured
since
it
was
not
for
him
he
said
to
work
for
his
successor
benefit
this
of
course
meant
the
sterilisation
of
the
property
whose
value
would
thus
be
annihilated
it
everywhere
the
same
continued
boisgelin
agree
the
workers
want
to
take
the
places
of
the
owners
and
agriculture
suffers
from
the
quarrel
at
les
combettes
now
that
village
yonder
whose
land
is
only
separated
from
mine
by
the
formerie
road
you
ca
imagine
what
little
agreement
there
is
among
the
peasants
what
efforts
each
of
them
makes
to
harm
his
neighbour
paralysing
himself
the
while
ah
there
was
something
good
in
feudality
after
all
those
fine
fellows
would
walk
straight
enough
if
they
had
nothing
of
their
own
and
were
convinced
that
they
would
never
have
anything
this
abrupt
conclusion
made
luc
smile
nevertheless
he
was
struck
by
the
unconscious
confession
that
the
pretended
bankruptcy
of
the
soil
came
from
a
lack
of
agreement
among
those
who
tilled
it
the
party
was
now
quitting
the
park
and
the
young
man
glance
ranged
over
the
great
plain
of
la
roumagne
formerly
so
famous
for
its
fruitfulness
but
now
accused
of
growing
cold
and
sterile
and
of
no
longer
yielding
sustenance
for
its
inhabitants
on
the
left
spread
the
extensive
lands
of
boisgelin
farm
whilst
on
the
right
luc
perceived
the
humble
roofs
of
les
combettes
around
which
were
grouped
many
small
fields
cut
up
into
little
morsels
by
repeated
partition
amongst
numerous
heirs
in
such
wise
that
the
whole
resembled
a
stretch
of
patchwork
and
luc
asked
himself
what
could
possibly
be
done
in
order
that
cordial
agreement
might
return
in
order
that
from
so
many
contradictory
and
barren
efforts
a
great
impulse
of
solidarity
might
spring
with
universal
happiness
for
its
object
it
so
happened
that
as
the
promenaders
were
approaching
the
farmhouse
a
large
and
fairly
building
they
heard
some
loud
swearing
and
thumping
of
fists
upon
a
table
in
fact
all
the
uproar
of
a
violent
quarrel
then
they
saw
two
peasants
one
stout
and
heavy
and
the
other
thin
and
nervous
come
out
of
the
house
and
after
threatening
one
another
for
a
last
time
go
off
each
by
a
different
path
through
the
fields
towards
les
combettes
the
matter
feuillat
boisgelin
inquired
of
the
farmer
who
had
come
to
his
threshold
it
nothing
monsieur
only
two
more
fellows
of
les
combettes
who
had
a
dispute
about
a
boundary
and
wanted
me
to
umpire
between
them
the
lenfants
and
the
yvonnots
have
been
disputing
together
from
father
to
son
for
years
and
years
past
and
it
maddens
them
nowadays
merely
to
catch
sight
of
one
another
it
of
no
use
my
talking
reason
to
them
you
heard
them
just
now
they
like
to
devour
one
another
and
what
fools
they
are
they
be
so
happy
and
well
off
if
they
would
only
reflect
and
agree
together
a
little
bit
then
sorry
perhaps
that
he
had
allowed
this
remark
to
escape
him
for
it
was
not
one
which
the
master
should
have
heard
feuillat
let
his
eyelids
fall
and
with
an
expressionless
impenetrable
face
resumed
in
a
husky
voice
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
like
to
come
in
and
rest
a
moment
luc
however
had
previously
seen
the
man
eyes
glittering
he
was
surprised
to
find
him
so
wan
and
dry
as
if
his
tall
slim
figure
were
already
grilled
by
the
sunlight
although
he
was
but
forty
years
of
age
at
the
same
time
feuillat
was
possessed
of
quick
intelligence
as
the
young
man
soon
discovered
on
listening
to
his
conversation
with
boisgelin
when
the
latter
in
a
laughing
way
inquired
if
he
had
thought
over
the
matter
of
the
lease
the
farmer
wagged
his
head
and
answered
briefly
like
a
careful
diplomatist
desirous
of
gaining
his
point
he
evidently
kept
back
his
real
thoughts
the
thought
that
the
land
ought
to
belong
to
those
who
tilled
it
to
one
and
all
of
them
in
order
that
they
might
once
more
love
and
fertilise
it
the
soil
said
he
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
his
father
and
his
grandfather
had
loved
it
passionately
but
what
good
had
that
done
to
them
for
his
part
his
love
could
wait
until
he
was
able
to
fertilise
the
soil
for
himself
and
his
kindred
and
not
for
a
landlord
whose
one
thought
would
be
to
raise
the
rent
as
soon
as
the
crops
should
increase
and
there
was
something
else
beneath
the
man
reticence
something
that
he
pictured
whenever
he
tried
to
peer
into
the
future
a
reasonable
agreement
among
the
peasantry
the
reunion
of
all
the
subdivided
fields
so
that
they
might
be
worked
in
common
so
that
tillage
might
be
carried
on
upon
a
vast
scale
with
the
help
of
machinery
such
indeed
were
the
few
ideas
which
had
gradually
come
to
his
mind
ideas
which
were
best
kept
from
the
but
which
all
the
same
occasionally
escaped
him
the
promenaders
had
ended
by
entering
the
farmhouse
to
sit
down
there
and
rest
a
moment
and
luc
there
again
found
the
coldness
and
bareness
the
odour
of
toil
and
poverty
with
which
he
had
been
struck
so
much
on
the
previous
evening
at
bonnaire
home
in
the
rue
des
trois
lunes
dry
and
ashen
like
her
man
la
feuillat
stood
there
in
an
attitude
of
silent
resignation
beside
her
one
child
lÃ©on
a
big
boy
of
twelve
who
already
helped
his
father
in
the
fields
and
it
was
evident
to
luc
that
on
all
sides
among
the
peasants
as
among
the
industrial
workmen
one
found
labour
accursed
dishonoured
regarded
as
a
stain
a
disgrace
since
it
did
not
even
provide
food
for
the
slave
who
was
riveted
to
his
toil
as
to
a
chain
in
the
neighbouring
village
of
les
combettes
the
sufferings
were
certainly
greater
than
at
that
farm
the
dwellings
there
were
sordid
dens
the
life
was
that
of
domestic
animals
fed
upon
sops
the
lenfants
with
their
son
arsÃ¨ne
and
their
daughter
olympe
the
yvonnots
who
also
had
two
children
eugÃ©nie
and
nicolas
all
found
themselves
in
filthy
abject
wretchedness
and
added
to
their
woes
by
their
rageful
passion
to
prey
on
one
another
luc
listening
and
glancing
around
him
pictured
all
the
horrors
of
that
social
hell
telling
himself
the
while
however
that
the
solution
of
the
problem
lay
in
that
direction
for
as
soon
as
a
new
social
system
should
be
perfected
one
would
necessarily
have
to
come
back
to
the
earth
the
eternal
nurse
the
common
mother
who
alone
could
provide
men
with
daily
bread
at
last
on
leaving
the
farm
boisgelin
said
to
feuillat
you
must
think
it
over
my
good
fellow
the
land
has
gained
in
value
and
it
only
just
that
i
should
profit
by
it
it
all
thought
over
now
monsieur
the
farmer
answered
will
suit
me
just
as
well
to
starve
on
the
road
as
in
your
farm
that
was
his
last
word
on
the
way
back
to
la
guerdache
by
another
more
solitary
and
shady
road
of
the
park
the
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
broke
up
the
and
lÃ©onore
lingered
in
the
rear
and
soon
found
themselves
far
behind
the
others
whilst
boisgelin
and
fernande
gradually
drew
upon
one
side
and
disappeared
as
if
mistaking
their
way
straying
into
lonely
paths
amidst
their
animated
conversation
meantime
the
two
husbands
gourier
and
delaveau
placidly
continued
following
the
avenue
talking
as
they
went
about
an
article
on
the
end
of
the
strike
that
had
appeared
in
the
de
beauclair
a
little
print
with
a
circulation
of
five
hundred
copies
which
was
published
by
a
certain
lebleu
a
petty
bookseller
and
which
counted
among
its
contributors
both
abbÃ©
marle
and
captain
jollivet
the
mayor
deplored
that
the
deity
should
have
been
introduced
into
the
affair
though
like
the
manager
of
the
abyss
he
approved
of
the
general
tone
of
the
article
which
was
a
perfect
chant
of
triumph
celebrating
the
victory
of
capital
over
the
in
the
most
lyric
style
luc
walking
near
the
others
grew
weary
of
hearing
their
comments
on
this
article
and
at
last
after
manÅuvring
so
as
to
let
them
distance
him
he
plunged
among
the
trees
confident
that
he
would
find
la
guerdache
again
as
soon
as
was
necessary
how
charming
was
the
solitude
amidst
those
dense
thickets
through
which
the
warm
september
sun
sent
a
rain
of
golden
sparks
for
a
time
the
young
man
wandered
at
random
well
pleased
at
finding
himself
alone
at
being
able
to
breathe
freely
in
the
midst
of
nature
relieved
of
the
load
that
had
oppressed
him
in
the
presence
of
all
those
folks
who
weighed
upon
his
mind
and
heart
yet
he
was
thinking
of
joining
them
once
more
when
all
at
once
near
the
formerie
road
he
came
out
into
some
extensive
meadows
through
which
a
little
branch
of
the
mionne
coursed
feeding
a
large
pond
and
the
scene
which
he
there
encountered
greatly
amused
him
fraught
as
it
was
with
charm
and
hope
paul
boisgelin
had
obtained
permission
to
take
his
two
little
guests
nise
delaveau
and
louise
mazelle
to
this
spot
the
maids
in
charge
of
them
were
lying
down
under
a
willow
and
gossiping
paying
no
further
attention
to
the
children
but
the
great
feature
of
the
adventure
was
that
the
heir
of
la
guerdache
and
the
young
ladies
in
bibs
had
found
the
pond
in
the
possession
of
some
invaders
three
youngsters
who
had
either
climbed
a
wall
or
slipped
through
a
hedge
to
his
surprise
luc
found
that
the
leader
and
soul
of
the
trespassing
expedition
was
nanet
behind
whom
were
lucien
and
antoinette
bonnaire
evidently
enough
it
was
nanet
who
profiting
by
the
freedom
of
sunday
had
led
the
others
astray
far
from
the
rue
des
trois
lunes
and
the
explanation
of
it
all
was
simple
enough
lucien
had
fitted
a
little
boat
with
a
mechanism
that
carried
it
over
the
water
and
nanet
having
offered
to
take
him
to
a
fine
pond
he
knew
one
where
nobody
was
ever
met
the
little
boat
was
now
sailing
unaided
over
the
clear
unrippled
pool
to
the
children
it
seemed
quite
a
prodigy
lucien
stroke
of
genius
had
simply
consisted
in
adapting
the
wheels
and
clockwork
springs
of
a
little
toy
cart
to
a
boat
which
he
had
fashioned
out
of
a
piece
of
deal
this
boat
travelled
quite
thirty
feet
through
the
water
without
the
spring
requiring
to
be
wound
afresh
but
unfortunately
in
order
to
bring
the
boat
back
again
it
was
necessary
to
use
a
long
pole
which
on
each
occasion
almost
made
the
little
vessel
sink
speechless
with
admiration
paul
and
his
young
lady
friends
stood
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
watching
the
wonderful
boat
but
louise
with
her
eyes
glittering
in
her
slender
face
which
suggested
that
of
a
playful
little
goat
was
soon
carried
away
by
a
boundless
desire
to
possess
the
toy
and
thrusting
out
her
little
fists
she
cried
repeatedly
it
want
it
then
as
lucien
with
the
aid
of
his
pole
brought
the
boat
back
to
shore
in
order
to
wind
up
the
spring
afresh
she
eagerly
ran
towards
him
good
nature
and
the
pleasure
of
play
brought
them
together
made
it
you
know
said
the
lad
let
me
see
give
it
me
replied
the
damsel
but
that
was
asking
him
too
much
and
he
energetically
defended
the
boat
from
the
approach
of
her
pillaging
hands
no
said
he
gave
me
too
much
trouble
leave
go
or
break
it
however
finding
her
very
pretty
and
gay
he
became
more
cordial
and
said
to
her
make
you
another
one
if
you
like
then
he
put
the
boat
in
the
water
again
and
the
wheels
once
more
began
to
revolve
whilst
louise
accepted
his
offer
clapping
her
hands
and
sitting
down
on
the
grass
by
his
side
in
her
turn
won
over
and
treating
him
as
if
he
were
an
habitual
playfellow
meantime
it
vaguely
occurred
to
paul
who
was
the
oldest
of
the
whole
party
quite
a
little
man
of
seven
that
he
ought
to
find
out
who
the
others
were
noticing
antoinette
he
felt
emboldened
by
her
amiable
demeanour
her
healthy
pretty
face
so
he
inquired
old
are
you
four
years
old
but
papa
says
i
look
as
if
i
was
six
your
papa
is
papa
why
papa
of
course
silly
the
little
minx
laughed
in
such
a
pretty
way
that
paul
regarded
her
answer
as
decisive
and
questioned
her
no
further
but
sat
down
by
her
side
in
such
wise
that
they
at
once
became
the
best
friends
in
the
world
she
looked
so
pleasant
with
her
good
health
and
pert
expression
that
he
doubtless
failed
to
notice
that
she
wore
a
very
simple
woollen
frock
devoid
of
all
pretensions
to
elegance
your
papa
said
she
all
these
trees
belong
to
him
what
a
lot
of
room
you
have
to
play
in
we
got
in
through
the
hole
in
the
hedge
over
there
you
know
is
allowed
said
paul
i
not
often
allowed
to
come
here
since
i
might
fall
into
the
water
but
it
so
amusing
you
must
say
anything
because
we
should
get
punished
if
you
did
but
all
at
once
a
dramatic
incident
occurred
master
nanet
who
was
so
fair
and
had
been
standing
in
admiration
before
nise
who
was
yet
fairer
and
more
than
himself
they
looked
like
two
toys
and
they
speedily
ran
towards
one
another
as
if
indeed
it
were
needful
that
they
should
pair
off
and
had
been
awaiting
that
meeting
catching
hold
of
each
other
hands
they
laughed
face
to
face
and
played
at
pushing
then
nanet
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
exclaimed
no
need
of
a
pole
to
get
his
boat
i
go
and
fetch
it
in
the
water
i
would
stirred
to
enthusiasm
nise
who
likewise
favoured
extraordinary
diversions
seconded
the
proposal
yes
we
all
ought
to
get
into
the
water
let
all
take
our
shoes
off
then
however
as
she
leant
over
the
pond
she
almost
fell
into
it
at
this
all
her
girlish
boastfulness
abandoned
her
and
she
raised
a
piercing
shriek
when
she
saw
the
water
wetting
her
boots
but
the
lad
bravely
rushed
forward
caught
hold
of
her
with
his
little
arms
which
were
already
strong
and
carried
her
like
a
trophy
to
the
grass
where
she
again
began
to
laugh
and
play
with
him
the
pair
of
them
rolling
about
like
a
couple
of
romping
kids
unfortunately
the
shrill
cry
which
nise
had
raised
in
her
fright
had
roused
the
maids
from
their
forgetful
gossiping
under
the
willow
they
rose
and
were
stupefied
at
the
sight
of
the
invaders
those
youngsters
who
had
sprung
they
knew
not
whence
and
who
had
the
impudence
to
romp
with
the
children
of
the
servants
hurried
up
with
such
angry
mien
that
lucien
hastened
to
take
possession
of
his
boat
for
fear
lest
it
should
be
confiscated
and
ran
off
as
fast
as
his
little
legs
would
carry
him
followed
by
antoinette
and
even
nanet
who
was
likewise
they
rushed
to
the
hedge
fell
flat
upon
their
stomachs
slipped
out
and
disappeared
whilst
the
servants
returned
to
la
guerdache
with
their
three
charges
agreeing
between
themselves
that
they
would
say
nothing
of
what
had
occurred
in
order
that
nobody
might
be
scolded
luc
remained
alone
laughing
amused
by
the
scene
that
he
had
thus
come
upon
under
the
paternal
sun
in
the
midst
of
friendly
nature
ah
the
dear
little
ones
how
soon
they
agreed
together
how
easily
they
overcame
all
difficulties
ignorant
as
they
were
of
all
fratricidal
struggles
and
what
hope
of
a
triumphant
future
they
brought
with
them
in
five
minutes
the
young
man
reached
la
guerdache
again
and
there
he
once
more
fell
into
the
horrible
present
reeking
of
egotism
the
hateful
un
which
all
evil
passions
contended
it
was
now
four
and
the
boisgelins
guests
were
taking
leave
luc
was
most
struck
however
on
perceiving
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
reclining
in
his
on
the
left
of
the
flight
of
steps
the
old
gentleman
had
just
returned
from
his
long
promenade
and
had
signed
to
his
servant
to
leave
him
there
a
little
while
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
as
if
indeed
he
desired
to
witness
the
departure
of
the
guests
invited
to
the
house
that
day
on
the
steps
amongst
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
all
ready
to
depart
stood
suzanne
waiting
for
her
husband
who
had
lingered
in
the
park
with
fernande
some
minutes
had
elapsed
after
the
return
of
the
others
when
she
at
last
saw
boisgelin
appear
with
the
young
woman
they
were
walking
quietly
side
by
side
and
chatting
together
as
if
their
long
stroll
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
suzanne
asked
no
explanations
but
luc
plainly
saw
that
her
hands
trembled
and
that
an
expression
of
dolorous
bitterness
passed
over
her
face
between
her
smiles
for
she
had
to
play
the
part
of
a
good
hostess
and
affect
amiability
and
she
felt
keenly
wounded
and
could
not
help
starting
when
boisgelin
addressing
captain
jollivet
declared
that
he
should
soon
go
to
see
him
in
order
that
they
might
consult
together
and
organise
that
which
hitherto
he
had
but
vaguely
thought
of
thus
the
die
was
cast
the
wife
was
defeated
the
other
had
won
the
day
had
imposed
her
foolish
and
wasteful
whim
upon
her
lover
during
that
long
stroll
which
for
impudence
was
tantamount
to
a
publicly
given
assignation
suzanne
heart
rose
rebelliously
at
the
thought
of
it
all
why
should
she
not
take
her
son
and
go
away
with
him
then
by
a
visible
effort
she
calmed
herself
becoming
very
dignified
and
lofty
bent
on
shielding
the
honour
of
her
name
and
her
house
with
all
the
abnegation
of
a
virtuous
woman
relapsing
into
the
silence
of
heroic
affection
that
silence
in
which
she
had
resolved
to
live
since
it
would
protect
her
from
all
the
mire
around
her
luc
who
could
divine
everything
now
only
detected
her
torment
in
the
quiver
of
her
feverish
hand
when
he
pressed
it
on
bidding
her
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
meanwhile
had
watched
the
scene
with
those
eyes
of
his
clear
like
spring
water
in
which
one
wondered
whether
there
yet
lingered
intelligence
to
understand
and
judge
things
and
he
afterwards
witnessed
the
departure
of
the
guests
that
departure
which
suggested
a
of
all
the
elements
of
human
power
all
the
social
authorities
the
masters
who
served
as
examples
to
the
masses
chÃ¢telard
went
off
in
his
carriage
with
gourier
and
lÃ©onore
the
latter
of
whom
offered
a
seat
to
abbÃ©
marle
in
such
wise
that
she
and
the
priest
sat
face
to
face
with
the
and
the
mayor
then
captain
jollivet
who
drove
a
hired
tilbury
carried
off
judge
gaume
and
his
betrothed
lucile
the
former
anxiously
watching
his
languishing
airs
next
the
mazelles
who
had
arrived
in
a
huge
landau
climbed
into
it
again
as
into
a
soft
bed
where
they
lay
back
completing
their
digestion
and
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
to
whom
they
all
bowed
in
silence
according
to
the
custom
of
the
house
watched
them
all
go
like
a
child
may
watch
passing
shadows
without
the
faintest
expression
of
any
feeling
appearing
on
his
cold
face
only
the
delaveaus
remained
and
the
manager
of
the
abyss
insisted
on
giving
luc
a
lift
in
boisgelin
victoria
in
order
to
spare
him
the
necessity
of
walking
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
set
the
young
man
down
at
his
door
since
they
would
pass
la
crÃªcherie
on
their
way
as
there
was
only
a
folding
bracket
seat
fernande
would
take
nise
on
her
lap
and
the
maid
would
sit
beside
the
coachman
monsieur
froment
it
will
be
a
real
pleasure
for
me
to
drive
you
home
delaveau
insisted
in
his
most
obliging
way
luc
ended
by
accepting
the
offer
then
boisgelin
clumsily
referred
to
the
hunt
again
inquiring
if
the
young
man
would
still
be
at
beauclair
in
order
to
attend
it
luc
answered
that
he
could
not
tell
how
long
he
might
be
in
the
district
but
at
all
events
they
must
not
rely
on
him
suzanne
listened
with
a
smile
then
her
eyes
moistening
at
the
thought
of
his
brotherly
sympathy
she
again
pressed
his
hand
saying
my
friend
when
the
victoria
eventually
started
luc
eyes
for
the
last
time
met
those
of
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
which
it
seemed
to
him
were
travelling
from
fernande
to
suzanne
slowly
taking
note
of
the
supreme
destruction
with
which
his
race
was
threatened
but
was
not
that
an
illusion
on
part
was
there
not
in
the
depths
of
those
eyes
merely
the
emotion
the
vague
smile
which
always
gleamed
therein
whenever
the
old
man
looked
at
his
dear
granddaughter
the
only
one
whom
he
still
loved
and
whom
he
was
still
willing
to
recognise
whilst
the
victoria
was
rolling
towards
beauclair
luc
promptly
learnt
why
delaveau
had
been
so
anxious
to
drive
him
home
for
the
manager
again
began
to
question
him
about
his
sudden
journey
what
its
purpose
might
be
and
what
jordan
would
do
with
reference
to
the
management
of
his
now
that
the
old
engineer
laroche
was
dead
one
of
delaveau
secret
projects
had
been
to
buy
the
as
well
as
the
extensive
tract
of
land
which
separated
it
from
the
in
such
wise
as
to
double
the
value
of
the
abyss
but
the
whole
constituted
a
big
mouthful
and
as
he
did
not
expect
to
have
the
necessary
money
for
such
a
purchase
for
a
long
time
to
come
he
had
only
thought
of
slow
progressive
extension
on
the
other
hand
the
sudden
death
of
laroche
had
now
quickened
his
desires
and
he
had
fancied
that
he
might
perhaps
be
able
to
come
to
arrangements
with
jordan
whom
he
knew
to
be
immersed
in
his
favourite
scientific
studies
and
desirous
of
ridding
himself
of
a
business
which
brought
him
a
deal
of
worry
this
was
why
the
sudden
arrival
of
luc
in
response
to
a
summons
from
jordan
had
greatly
disturbed
delaveau
who
feared
that
the
young
man
might
upset
the
plans
of
which
he
had
hitherto
only
spoken
indirectly
at
the
first
questions
which
the
manager
put
to
him
in
a
way
luc
although
unable
to
understand
everything
became
suspicious
and
he
therefore
replied
evasively
know
nothing
i
have
not
seen
jordan
for
more
than
six
months
said
he
for
his
why
i
suppose
that
he
will
simply
confide
the
management
to
some
clever
young
engineer
whilst
he
spoke
he
noticed
that
fernande
eyes
never
left
him
nise
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
young
woman
lap
and
she
kept
silence
seemingly
greatly
interested
in
the
conversation
of
the
others
as
if
she
could
divine
that
her
future
was
at
stake
for
she
had
already
detected
that
this
young
man
was
an
enemy
had
he
not
sided
with
suzanne
in
the
matter
of
the
hunt
had
not
she
fernande
seen
them
in
cordial
agreement
with
their
hands
clasped
like
brother
and
sister
then
feeling
that
war
was
virtually
declared
between
them
she
smiled
a
keen
cruel
smile
like
one
determined
on
victory
i
merely
mention
the
matter
repeated
delaveau
beating
a
retreat
i
was
told
that
jordan
thought
of
confining
himself
to
his
studies
and
discoveries
some
of
the
latter
are
admirable
admirable
repeated
luc
with
the
conviction
of
an
enthusiast
at
last
the
carriage
stopped
before
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
young
man
alighted
thanked
delaveau
and
found
himself
alone
he
again
felt
the
great
quiver
that
had
come
upon
him
during
those
two
days
which
beneficent
destiny
had
granted
him
since
his
arrival
at
beauclair
he
had
there
seen
both
sides
of
the
hateful
world
whose
framework
was
falling
to
pieces
from
sheer
rottenness
the
iniquitous
misery
of
some
the
pestilential
wealth
of
others
work
badly
remunerated
held
in
contempt
unjustly
apportioned
had
become
mere
torture
and
shame
when
it
should
have
been
the
very
nobility
health
and
happiness
of
mankind
luc
heart
was
bursting
at
the
thought
of
it
all
and
his
brain
seemed
to
open
as
if
to
give
birth
to
the
ideas
which
he
had
felt
within
him
for
months
past
and
a
cry
for
justice
sprang
from
his
whole
being
ay
there
was
no
other
possible
mission
nowadays
than
that
of
hastening
to
the
succour
of
the
wretched
and
setting
a
little
justice
once
more
upon
the
earth
the
lycÃ©e
condorcet

always
been
both
the
most
elegant
and
the
most

among
those

on

time

during
the
second
empire
were
many
who
have
since
become
distinguished
french
journalists
authors
and
iv
the
jordans
were
to
return
to
beauclair
on
the
monday
by
a
train
arriving
in
the
evening
and
luc
spent
the
morning
of
that
day
in
strolling
through
the
park
of
la
crÃªcherie
which
was
not
more
than
fifty
acres
in
extent
though
its
exceptional
situation
its
watercourses
and
superb
greenery
made
it
quite
a
paradise
famous
throughout
the
whole
region
the
house
a
by
no
means
large
building
of
brick
of
no
particular
style
had
been
erected
by
jordan
grandfather
in
the
time
of
louis
xviii
on
the
site
of
an
old
chÃ¢teau
destroyed
during
the
revolution
close
behind
it
rose
the
range
of
the
bleuse
mountains
that
steep
gigantic
wall
which
jutted
out
like
a
promontory
at
the
point
where
the
brias
gorge
opened
into
the
great
plain
of
la
roumagne
protected
in
this
wise
from
the
north
winds
and
looking
towards
the
south
the
park
was
like
a
natural
where
eternal
springtide
reigned
thanks
to
a
number
of
springs
gushing
forth
in
crystalline
cascades
the
rocky
wall
was
covered
with
vigorous
vegetation
and
flights
of
steps
cut
in
the
stone
ascended
to
the
summit
amidst
climbing
plants
and
evergreen
shrubs
down
below
the
springs
united
and
flowing
on
in
a
slow
river
watered
the
whole
park
the
great
lawns
and
the
clumps
of
lofty
trees
which
were
of
the
finest
and
most
vigorous
kinds
jordan
had
virtually
left
that
luxuriant
corner
of
nature
to
look
after
itself
for
he
only
employed
one
gardener
and
two
lads
who
apart
from
attending
to
the
kitchen
garden
and
a
few
below
the
simply
had
to
keep

somewhat
tidy
jordan
grandfather
aurÃ©lien
jordan
de
beauvisage
was
born
in
on
the
eve
of
the
reign
of
terror
the
beauvisages
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
illustrious
families
of
the
district
had
then
already
fallen
from
their
high
estate
and
of
their
formerly
vast
territorial
possessions
they
only
retained
two
farms
now
annexed
to
les
combettes
and
between
two
and
three
thousand
acres
of
bare
rock
and
barren
moor
a
broad
strip
indeed
of
the
lofty
plateau
of
the
bleuse
mountains
aurÃ©lien
was
less
than
three
years
old
when
his
parents
were
compelled
to
emigrate
abandoning
their
flaming
chÃ¢teau
one
terrible
winter
night
and
until
aurÃ©lien
had
his
home
in
austria
where
his
mother
and
then
his
father
died
in
swift
succession
leaving
him
in
a
fearful
state
of
penury
reared
in
the
hard
school
of
manual
toil
with
no
other
bread
to
eat
than
that
which
he
earned
as
a
worker
in
an
iron
mine
he
had
just
completed
his
year
when
under
louis
he
returned
to
beauclair
and
found
the
ancestral
property
still
further
diminished
for
the
two
farms
were
lost
and
there
now
only
remained
the
little
park
and
the
two
or
three
thousand
acres
of
stones
which
nobody
cared
for
misfortune
had
democratised
aurÃ©lien
who
felt
that
he
could
no
longer
be
a
beauvisage
henceforth
then
he
simply
signed
himself
jordan
and
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
very
rich
farmer
of
his
wife
dowry
enabling
him
to
build
on
the
site
of
the
old
chÃ¢teau
the
brick
residence
in
which
his
grandson
now
dwelt
but
he
had
become
a
worker
his
hands
were
still
grimy
and
he
remembered
the
iron
mine
and
where
he
had
toiled
in
austria
already
in
he
began
to
look
around
him
and
at
last
among
the
desolate
rocks
of
his
domain
he
discovered
a
similar
mine
the
existence
of
which
he
had
been
led
to
suspect
by
certain
old
stories
told
him
by
his
parents
and
then
up
the
ridge
on
a
kind
of
natural
landing
or
platform
above
la
crÃªcherie
he
installed
his
own
the
first
established
in
the
region
from
that
moment
he
became
absorbed
in
industrial
toil
though
without
ever
realising
any
very
large
profits
for
he
lacked
capital
and
his
life
proved
one
continual
battle
from
that
cause
his
only
title
to
the
gratitude
of
the
district
was
that
by
the
presence
of
his
he
brought
thither
the
who
had
created
all
the
great
establishments

one

with

most
perfect
plant

known

thus
amidst
the
great
fortune
which
they
acquired
the
only
grief
of
the
jordans

to
remain
for
many

childless

ten
years

and
of
the
first
days
withdrew
in
his
old
age
to
la
crÃªcherie
where
his
daughter
built
him
a
pavilion
the
one
indeed
which
luc
had
lately
occupied
there
it
was
that
the
doctor
died
among
his
books
amidst
all
the
gaiety
of
sunshine
and
flowers
and
until
the
death
of

fondly
loved

occurred
five
years
after

martial
jordan
was
thirty
years
of
age
and
sÅurette
was
twenty
when
they
first
found
themselves
alone
and
five
years
had
now
elapsed
since
that
time
he
in
spite
of
his
indifferent
health
the
frequent
illnesses
of
which
his
mother
had
cured
him
by
force
of
love
had
passed
through
the
polytechnic
school
but
on
his
return
to
la
crÃªcherie
finding
himself
master
of
his
destiny
thanks
to
the
large
fortune
he
inherited
he
had
relinquished
all
thoughts
of
official
appointments
and
had
taken
passionately
to
the
investigations
which
the
application
of
electricity
offered
to
studious
scientists
on
one
side
of
the
house
he
built
a
very
spacious
laboratory
installed
the
necessary
machinery
for
powerful
motive
force
in
an
adjacent
shed
and
then
gradually
took
to
special
studies
surrendering
himself
almost
completely
to
the
dream
of
smelting
ore
in
electrical
furnaces
in
a
practical
way
adapted
to
the
requirements
of
industry
and
from
that
time
he
virtually
cloistered
himself
lived
like
a
monk
absorbed
in
his
experiments
his
great
work
which
became
as
it
were
his
very
life
beside
him
his
sister
had
now
taken
his
dead
mother
place
and
indeed
before
long
sÅurette
was
like
his
faithful
guardian
his
good
angel
one
who
took
every
care
of
him
and
set
round
him
all
the
warm
affection
that
he
needed
moreover
she
managed
the
household
spared
him
many
material
worries
served
him
as
a
secretary
and
rendered
all
sorts
of
help
ever
gently
and
quietly
with
a
placid
smile
upon
her
face

luckily
gave
no
trouble
for

a
bequest
of
aurÃ©lien
jordan
the
founder
had
been
there
more
than
thirty
years
in
such
wise
that
the
present
owner
deeply
immersed
in
his
studies
and
experiments
was
able
to
detach
himself
entirely
from
business
matters
he
left
the
worthy
laroche
free
to
manage
the
in
accordance
with
the
routine
of
years
for
he
himself
had
ceased
to
bother
about
possible
ameliorations
since
he
cared
nothing
for
mere
relative
transitory
improvements
now
that
he
had
begun
to
seek
the
radical
change
the
art
of
smelting
by
electrical
means
which
would
revolutionise
the
whole
world
of
metallurgical
industry
indeed
it
was
often
sÅurette
who
had
to
intervene
and
come
to
a
decision
on
certain
matters
with
laroche
particularly
when
she
knew
that
her
mind
was
busy
with
some
important
investigation
and
she
did
not
wish
him
to
be
disturbed
by
any
outside
matters
now
however
sudden
death
had
so
thoroughly
upset
the
usual
order
of
things
that
jordan
who
deemed
himself
sufficiently
rich
and
had
no
ambition
apart
from
his
studies
would
willingly
have
rid
himself
of
the
by
at
once
opening
negotiations
with
delaveau
whose
desires
were
known
to
him
had
not
sÅurette
more
prudently
obtained
from
him
a
promise
that
he
would
in
the
first
place
consult
luc
in
whom
she
placed
great
confidence
thence
had
come
the
pressing
call
addressed
to
the
young
man
which
had
brought
him
so
suddenly
to
beauclair
luc
had
first
met
the
jordans
brother
and
sister
at
the
residence
in
paris
in
which
city
they
had
established
themselves
one
winter
in
order
to
prosecute
certain
studies
successfully
great
sympathy
had
arisen
between
them
based
on
luc
side
upon
his
great
admiration
for
the
brother
whose
scientific
talent
transported
him
and
upon
deep
affection
mingled
with
respect
for
the
sister
who
seemed
to
him
like
some
divine
personification
of
goodness
he
himself
was
then
working
with
the
celebrated
chemist
bourdin
studying
some
iron
ores
overcharged
with
sulphur
and
phosphates
which
it
was
desired
to
turn
to
commercial
use
and
sÅurette
recalled
certain
particulars
that
he
had
given
her
brother
on
this
subject
one
evening
which
she
well
remembered
now
for
more
than
ten
years
the
mine
discovered
by
aurÃ©lien
jordan
on
the
plateau
of
the
bleuse
mountains
had
been
abandoned
as
in
the
veins
reached
by
the
workers
sulphur
and
phosphorus
prevailed
to
such
a
point
that
the
ore
no
longer
yielded
enough
metal
to
pay
the
cost
of
extraction
thus
the
working
of
the
galleries
had
ceased
and
the
smeltery
of
la
crÃªcherie
was
now
fed
by
the
granval
mines
near
brias
a
little
railway
line
bringing
the
ore
which
was
of
fairly
good
quality
as
well
as
the
coal
of
the
neighbouring
pits
to
the
charging
platform
of
the
furnace
but
all
this
was
very
costly
and
sÅurette
often
thought
of
those
chemical
methods
the
employment
of
which
according
to
what
luc
had
said
might
perhaps
enable
them
to
work
their
own
mine
afresh
and
in
her
desire
to
consult
the
young
man
before
her
brother
came
to
a
positive
decision
she
felt
too
that
she
ought
to
know
the
real
value
of
what
would
be
ceded
to
delaveau
should
a
deed
of
sale
indeed
be
arranged
between
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
abyss
the
jordans
were
to
arrive
at
six
after
twelve
travelling
and
luc
went
to
wait
for
them
at
the
railway
station
driving
thither
in
the
carriage
which
was
to
bring
them
home
jordan
short
and
puny
had
a
somewhat
vague
long
and
gentle
face
with
hair
and
beard
of
a
faded
brown
he
alighted
from
the
train
wrapped
in
a
long
fur
overcoat
although
that
fine
september
day
was
a
warm
one
with
his
keen
penetrating
black
eyes
in
which
all
his
vitality
seemed
to
have
taken
refuge
he
was
the
first
to
perceive
his
friend
luc
my
dear
fellow
said
he
kind
of
you
to
have
waited
for
us
you
ca
have
an
idea
of
the
catastrophe
that
took
us
away
that
poor
cousin
of
ours
dying
like
that
all
alone
yonder
and
we
having
to
go
and
bury
him
when
there
nothing
we
hate
so
much
as
travelling
well
it
all
over
now
and
here
we
are
the
health
good
and
you
are
not
asked
luc
not
too
much
i
was
fortunately
able
to
sleep
but
sÅurette
was
in
her
turn
coming
up
after
making
sure
that
none
of
the
had
been
left
inside
the
carriage
she
was
not
pretty
like
her
brother
she
had
a
very
slight
figure
and
was
pale
complexionless
indeed
insignificant
after
the
fashion
of
a
woman
who
is
resigned
to
being
a
good
housewife
and
nurse
and
yet
her
tender
smiles
lent
infinite
charm
to
her
face
whose
only
beauty
dwelt
in
its
passionate
eyes
in
the
depths
of
which
glowed
all
the
craving
for
love
which
lurked
within
her
but
of
which
she
herself
was
as
yet
ignorant
hitherto
she
had
loved
none
excepting
her
brother
and
him
she
loved
after
the
fashion
of
some
cloistered
maid
who
for
the
sake
of
her
deity
renounces
the
whole
world
before
even
speaking
to
luc
she
called
careful
martial
you
ought
to
put
on
your
scarf
then
turning
towards
the
young
man
she
showed
herself
charming
at
once
giving
proof
of
the
keen
sympathy
she
felt
for
him
many
apologies
we
owe
you
monsieur
froment
what
can
you
have
thought
of
us
when
you
found
us
gone
on
your
arrival
have
you
been
comfortable
at
all
events
have
you
been
properly
cared
for
i
lived
like
a
prince
you
are
jesting
before
i
started
i
took
good
care
to
give
all
necessary
orders
so
that
you
might
lack
nothing
but
all
the
same
i
was
absent
and
unable
to
watch
and
you
can
not
imagine
how
vexed
i
felt
at
the
idea
of
abandoning
you
like
that
in
our
poor
empty
house
they
had
got
into
the
carriage
and
the
conversation
continued
as
they
drove
away
luc
fully
reassured
them
at
last
by
telling
them
that
he
had
spent
two
very
interesting
days
of
which
he
would
give
them
full
particulars
later
on
when
they
reached
la
crÃªcherie
although
the
night
was
falling
jordan
looked
eagerly
around
him
so
delighted
at
returning
to
his
wonted
life
that
he
gave
vent
to
cries
of
joy
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
coming
back
after
an
absence
of
several
weeks
how
could
one
find
any
pleasure
in
roaming
said
he
when
all
human
happiness
lay
in
the
little
nook
where
one
thought
where
one
worked
freed
by
habit
of
the
cares
of
life
whilst
waiting
for
sÅurette
to
have
the
dinner
served
jordan
washed
himself
in
some
warm
water
and
then
insisted
on
taking
luc
into
his
laboratory
for
he
himself
was
eager
to
return
thither
saying
with
a
light
laugh
that
he
should
have
no
appetite
for
dinner
if
he
did
not
first
of
all
breathe
the
air
of
the
room
in
which
his
life
was
spent
the
laboratory
was
a
very
large
and
lofty
place
built
of
brick
and
iron
with
broad
facing
the
greenery
of
the
park
an
immense
table
laden
with
apparatus
was
set
in
the
centre
and
all
round
the
walls
were
appliances
machine
tools
with
models
rough
drafts
of
plans
and
electrical
furnaces
on
a
reduced
scale
in
the
corners
a
system
of
cables
and
wires
hanging
overhead
from
end
to
end
of
the
room
brought
the
electrical
motive
force
from
the
neighbouring
shed
and
distributed
it
among
the
appliances
tools
and
furnaces
in
order
that
the
necessary
experiments
might
be
made
and
beside
all
this
scientific
severity
was
a
warm
and
cosy
retreat
in
front
of
one
of
the
windows
a
retreat
with
low
bookcases
and
deep
armchairs
the
couch
on
which
the
brother
dozed
at
appointed
hours
and
the
little
table
at
which
the
sister
sat
while
watching
over
him
or
assisting
him
like
a
faithful
secretary
jordan
touched
a
switch
and
the
whole
room
became
radiant
with
a
rush
of
electric
light
here
i
am
said
he
now
i
only
feel
all
right
when
at
home
by
the
way
that
misfortune
which
compelled
me
to
absent
myself
happened
just
as
i
was
becoming
passionately
interested
in
a
new
experiment
i
shall
have
to
begin
it
again
but
how
well
i
feel
he
continued
laughing
colour
had
come
to
his
cheeks
and
he
showed
far
more
animation
than
usual
leaning
back
on
the
couch
in
the
attitude
he
usually
assumed
when
yielding
to
thought
he
compelled
luc
also
to
sit
down
say
my
good
friend
he
continued
have
plenty
of
time
have
we
not
to
talk
of
the
matters
which
made
me
so
desirous
to
see
you
that
i
ventured
to
summon
you
here
besides
it
is
necessary
that
sÅurette
should
be
present
for
she
is
an
excellent
counsellor
so
if
you
are
agreeable
we
will
wait
till
after
dinner
we
will
have
our
chat
at
dessert
and
meantime
how
happy
i
feel
at
having
you
there
in
front
of
me
to
tell
you
how
i
am
getting
on
with
my
studies
they
progress
very
fast
but
i
work
at
them
and
that
the
great
thing
you
know
it
enough
if
one
works
two
hours
a
day
then
this
usually
taciturn
man
went
on
chatting
recounting
his
experiments
which
as
a
rule
he
confided
to
nobody
excepting
the
trees
of
his
park
as
he
sometimes
jestingly
exclaimed
an
electrical
furnace
being
already
devised
he
had
at
first
simply
sought
how
it
might
be
practically
employed
for
the
smelting
of
iron
ore
in
switzerland
where
the
motive
power
derived
from
the
torrents
enabled
one
to
perform
certain
work
inexpensively
he
had
inspected
furnaces
which
melted
aluminium
under
excellent
conditions
why
should
it
not
be
possible
to
treat
iron
in
the
same
way
to
solve
the
problem
it
was
only
necessary
to
apply
the
same
principles
to
a
given
case
the
in
use
gave
scarcely
more
than
degrees
of
heat
whereas
were
obtained
with
the
electrical
furnaces
a
temperature
which
would
produce
immediate
fusion
of
perfect
regularity
and
jordan
had
without
any
difficulty
planned
such
a
furnace
as
he
thought
advisable
a
simple
cube
of
brickwork
some
six
feet
long
on
each
side
the
bottom
and
crucible
being
of
magnesia
the
most
refractory
substance
known
he
had
also
calculated
and
determined
the
volume
of
the
electrodes
two
large
cylinders
of
carbon
and
his
first
real
find
consisted
in
discovering
that
he
might
borrow
from
them
the
carbon
necessary
to
disoxygenate
the
ore
in
such
wise
that
the
operation
of
smelting
would
be
greatly
simplified
for
there
would
be
but
little
slag
if
the
furnace
were
built
however
or
at
least
roughed
out
how
was
one
to
set
it
working
and
keep
it
working
in
a
practical
constant
manner
in
accordance
with
industrial
requirements
said
he
pointing
to
a
model
in
a
corner
of
the
laboratory
is
my
electrical
furnace
doubtless
it
needs
to
be
perfected
it
is
defective
in
various
respects
there
are
little
difficulties
which
are
not
yet
solved
nevertheless
such
as
it
is
it
has
given
me
some
pigs
of
excellent
cast
iron
and
i
estimate
that
a
battery
of
ten
similar
furnaces
working
for
ten
hours
would
do
the
work
of
three
establishments
like
mine
kept
alight
both
by
day
and
night
and
what
easy
work
it
would
be
without
any
cause
for
anxiety
work
which
children
might
direct
by
simply
turning
on
switches
but
i
must
confess
that
my
pigs
cost
me
as
much
money
as
if
they
were
silver
ingots
and
so
the
problem
is
plain
enough
my
furnace
so
far
is
only
a
laboratory
toy
and
will
only
exist
with
respect
to
industrial
enterprise
when
i
am
able
to
feed
it
with
an
abundance
of
electricity
at
a
sufficiently
low
cost
to
render
the
smelting
of
iron
ore
remunerative
then
he
explained
that
for
the
last
six
months
he
had
left
his
furnace
on
one
side
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
studying
the
transport
of
electrical
force
might
not
economy
already
be
realised
by
burning
coal
at
the
mouth
of
the
pit
it
came
from
and
by
transmitting
electrical
force
by
cables
to
the
distant
factories
requiring
it
that
again
was
a
problem
which
many
scientists
had
been
endeavouring
to
solve
for
several
years
and
unfortunately
they
all
found
themselves
confronted
by
a
considerable
loss
of
force
during
transit
more
experiments
have
just
been
made
said
luc
with
an
incredulous
air
really
think
that
there
is
no
means
of
preventing
loss
jordan
smiled
with
that
gentle
obstinacy
that
invincible
faith
which
he
brought
into
his
investigations
during
the
months
and
months
which
he
at
times
expended
over
them
before
arriving
at
the
slightest
grain
of
truth
must
think
nothing
before
one
is
quite
certain
said
he
have
already
secured
some
good
results
and
some
day
electrical
force
will
be
stored
up
canalised
and
directed
hither
and
thither
without
any
loss
at
all
if
twenty
years
searching
is
necessary
well
give
twenty
years
it
all
very
simple
one
sets
to
work
anew
every
morning
one
begins
afresh
until
one
finds
whatever
should
i
myself
do
if
i
did
not
begin
again
and
again
he
said
this
with
such
naÃ¯ve
grandeur
that
luc
felt
moved
as
by
a
deed
of
heroism
and
he
looked
at
jordan
so
slight
so
puny
of
build
ever
in
poor
health
coughing
under
his
scarves
and
shawls
in
that
vast
laboratory
littered
with
gigantic
appliances
traversed
by
wires
charged
with
lightning
and
filled
more
and
more
each
day
by
colossal
labour
the
labour
of
a
little
insignificant
being
who
went
to
and
fro
striving
battling
to
desperation
like
an
insect
lost
amidst
the
dust
of
the
ground
where
was
it
that
he
found
not
only
intellectual
energy
but
also
sufficient
physical
vigour
to
undertake
and
carry
through
so
many
mighty
tasks
for
the
accomplishment
of
which
the
lives
of
several
strong
healthy
men
seemed
to
be
necessary
he
could
hardly
trot
about
he
could
scarcely
breathe
and
yet
he
raised
a
very
world
with
his
little
hands
weak
though
they
were
like
those
of
a
sickly
child
however
sÅurette
now
made
her
appearance
and
gaily
exclaimed
are
you
coming
to
dinner
i
shall
lock
up
the
laboratory
my
dear
martial
if
you
wo
be
reasonable
the
like
the
two
rather
small
apartments
as
warm
and
as
cosy
as
nests
in
which
one
detected
the
watchful
care
of
a
woman
heart
overlooked
a
vast
stretch
of
greenery
a
panorama
of
meadows
and
ploughed
fields
spreading
to
the
dim
distant
horizon
of
la
roumagne
but
at
that
hour
of
night
although
the
weather
was
so
mild
the
curtains
were
drawn
luc
now
again
noticed
what
minute
attentions
the
sister
lavished
on
the
brother
he
martial
followed
quite
an
intricate
regimen
having
his
special
dishes
his
special
bread
and
even
his
special
water
which
was
slightly
warmed
in
order
to
the
chill
off
it
he
ate
like
a
bird
rose
and
went
to
bed
early
like
the
chickens
who
are
sensible
creatures
then
during
the
day
came
short
walks
and
rests
between
the
hours
that
he
gave
to
work
to
those
who
expressed
astonishment
at
the
prodigious
amount
of
work
that
he
accomplished
and
who
thought
him
a
terrible
labourer
toiling
from
morning
till
night
and
showing
himself
no
mercy
he
replied
that
he
worked
scarcely
three
hours
a
day
two
in
the
morning
and
one
in
the
afternoon
and
even
in
the
morning
a
spell
of
recreation
came
between
the
two
hours
that
he
gave
to
work
for
he
could
not
fix
his
attention
upon
a
subject
for
more
than
one
hour
at
a
stretch
without
experiencing
vertigo
without
feeling
as
if
his
brain
were
emptying
never
had
he
been
able
to
toil
for
a
longer
time
and
his
value
rested
solely
in
his
his
tenacity
the
passion
that
he
imported
into
the
work
which
he
undertook
and
with
which
he
persevered
on
and
on
in
all
intellectual
bravery
even
if
years
went
by
before
he
brought
it
to
a
head
luc
now
at
last
discovered
an
answer
to
that
question
which
he
had
so
often
asked
himself
wherever
did
jordan
who
was
so
slight
and
weak
find
the
strength
requisite
for
his
mighty
tasks
he
found
it
solely
in
method
in
the
careful
employment
of
all
his
means
however
slight
they
might
be
he
even
made
use
of
his
weakness
using
it
as
a
weapon
which
prevented
him
from
being
disturbed
by
outsiders
but
above
all
else
he
was
ever
intent
on
one
and
the
same
thing
the
work
he
had
in
hand
to
that
work
he
gave
every
minute
at
his
disposal
without
ever
yielding
to
discouragement
or
lassitude
but
sustained
by
the
unfailing
desperate
faith
which
raises
mountains
is
it
known
what
a
mass
of
work
one
may
pile
up
when
one
works
only
two
hours
a
day
on
some
useful
and
decisive
task
which
is
never
interrupted
by
idleness
or
fancy
such
work
is
like
the
grain
of
wheat
which
accumulating
fills
the
sack
or
like
the
drop
of
water
which
causes
the
river
to
overflow
stone
by
stone
the
edifice
rises
the
monument
grows
until
it
the
mountains
and
it
was
thus
by
a
prodigy
of
method
and
personal
adaptation
that
this
sickly
little
man
wrapped
in
rugs
and
drinking
his
water
warm
for
fear
lest
he
should
catch
cold
accomplished
work
of
the
mightiest
kind
and
this
although
he
gave
to
it
only
the
few
hours
of
intellectual
health
that
he
succeeded
in
wresting
from
his
physical
weakness
the
dinner
proved
a
very
friendly
and
cheerful
repast
the
household
service
was
entirely
in
the
hands
of
women
for
sÅurette
found
men
too
noisy
and
rough
for
her
brother
the
coachman
and
groom
simply
procured
assistants
on
certain
occasions
when
some
very
heavy
work
had
to
be
done
and
the
all
carefully
selected
gentle
and
skilful
contributed
to
the
happy
quiescence
of
that
cosy
dwelling
where
only
a
few
intimates
were
received
that
evening
for
the
return
of
the
master
and
mistress
the
dinner
consisted
of
some
clear
soup
a
barbel
from
the
mionne
with
melted
butter
a
roast
fowl
and
some
salad
all
very
simple
dishes
you
have
really
not
felt
since
saturday
sÅurette
inquired
of
luc
when
they
were
all
three
seated
at
the
table
i
assure
you
the
young
man
answered
besides
you
have
no
notion
how
fully
my
time
has
been
occupied
then
he
first
of
all
recounted
his
saturday
evening
the
covert
state
of
rebellion
in
which
he
had
found
beauclair
the
theft
of
a
loaf
by
nanet
the
arrest
of
lange
and
his
visit
to
bonnaire
the
victim
of
the
strike
but
by
a
strange
scruple
at
which
he
afterwards
felt
astonished
he
virtually
skipped
his
meeting
with
josine
and
did
not
mention
her
by
name
folks
exclaimed
sÅurette
compassionately
frightful
strike
reduced
them
to
bread
and
water
and
even
those
who
had
bread
were
lucky
what
can
one
do
how
can
one
help
them
alms
give
but
the
slightest
relief
and
you
do
know
how
distressed
i
have
been
during
the
last
two
months
at
feeling
that
we
the
rich
and
happy
are
so
utterly
powerless
she
was
a
humanitarian
a
pupil
of
her
grandfather
michon
the
old
fourierist
and
who
when
she
was
quite
little
had
taken
her
on
his
knees
to
tell
her
some
fine
stories
of
his
own
invention
stories
of
phalansteries
established
on
blissful
islands
of
cities
where
men
had
found
the
fulfilment
of
all
their
dreams
of
happiness
amidst
eternal
springtide
can
be
done
what
can
be
done
she
repeated
dolorously
with
her
beautiful
soft
compassionate
eyes
fixed
upon
luc
ought
to
be
done
surely
then
luc
emotion
gaining
on
him
raised
a
heartfelt
cry
yes
it
high
time
one
must
act
but
jordan
wagged
his
head
he
immersed
in
the
cloistered
life
of
a
scientist
never
occupied
himself
with
politics
he
held
them
in
contempt
and
unjustly
for
after
all
it
is
necessary
that
men
should
watch
over
the
manner
in
which
they
are
governed
he
however
living
amidst
the
absolute
regarded
passing
events
the
accidents
of
the
day
as
mere
jolts
on
the
road
and
consequently
of
no
account
according
to
him
it
was
science
alone
which
led
mankind
to
truth
justice
and
final
happiness
that
perfect
city
of
the
future
towards
which
the
nations
plod
on
so
slowly
and
with
so
much
anguish
of
what
use
therefore
was
it
to
worry
about
all
the
rest
was
it
not
sufficient
that
science
should
advance
for
it
advanced
in
spite
of
everything
each
of
its
conquests
was
definitive
and
whatever
might
be
the
catastrophes
of
the
journey
at
the
end
there
rose
the
victory
of
life
the
accomplishment
of
the
destiny
of
mankind
thus
though
he
was
very
gentle
and
like
his
sister
he
closed
his
ears
to
the
contemporary
battle
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
laboratory
where
as
he
expressed
it
he
manufactured
happiness
for
he
declared
in
his
turn
is
an
act
and
the
most
fruitful
of
all
acts
in
influence
upon
the
world
do
we
even
know
what
seeds
are
germinating
now
the
sufferings
of
all
those
poor
wretches
are
very
distressing
but
i
do
not
allow
myself
to
be
disturbed
by
them
for
the
harvest
will
come
in
its
due
season
luc
feverish
and
disturbed
as
he
himself
felt
did
not
insist
on
the
point
but
went
on
to
relate
how
he
had
spent
his
sunday
his
invitation
to
la
guerdache
the
lunch
there
the
people
he
had
met
at
table
and
what
had
been
done
and
what
had
been
said
but
whilst
he
spoke
he
could
see
that
the
brother
and
sister
were
becoming
cold
as
if
they
took
no
interest
in
all
those
folks
seldom
see
the
boisgelins
now
that
they
are
living
at
beauclair
jordan
exclaimed
with
his
quiet
frankness
showed
themselves
very
amiable
in
paris
but
here
we
lead
such
a
retired
life
that
all
intercourse
has
gradually
ceased
besides
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
our
ideas
and
our
habits
are
very
different
from
theirs
as
for
delaveau
he
is
an
intelligent
and
active
fellow
absorbed
in
his
business
as
i
am
in
mine
and
i
must
add
that
the
fine
society
of
beauclair
terrifies
me
to
such
a
point
that
i
keep
my
door
closed
to
it
delighted
at
its
indignation
and
at
remaining
alone
like
some
dangerous
madman
sÅurette
began
to
laugh
exaggerates
a
little
said
she
receive
abbÃ©
marle
who
is
a
worthy
man
as
well
as
doctor
novarre
and
hermeline
the
schoolmaster
whose
conversation
interests
me
and
if
it
is
true
that
we
remain
simply
on
a
footing
of
courtesy
with
la
guerdache
i
none
the
less
retain
sincere
friendship
for
madame
boisgelin
who
is
so
good
so
charming
jordan
who
liked
to
tease
his
sister
at
times
thereupon
exclaimed
do
you
say
at
once
that
it
is
i
who
compel
you
to
flee
the
world
and
that
if
i
were
not
here
you
would
throw
the
doors
wide
open
of
course
she
answered
gaily
house
is
such
as
you
desire
it
to
be
but
if
you
wish
it
i
am
quite
willing
to
give
a
great
ball
and
invite
chÃ¢telard
mayor
gourier
judge
gaume
captain
jollivet
and
the
mazelles
and
the
boisgelins
and
the
delaveaus
you
shall
open
the
ball
with
madame
mazelle
they
went
on
jesting
for
they
felt
very
happy
that
evening
both
on
account
of
their
return
to
their
nest
and
of
luc
presence
beside
them
at
last
when
the
dessert
was
served
they
proceeded
to
deal
with
the
great
question
the
two
silent
had
gone
off
in
their
light
felt
slippers
which
rendered
their
footsteps
inaudible
and
the
quiet
seemed
full
of
the
charm
of
affectionate
intimacy
when
hearts
and
minds
can
be
opened
in
all
freedom
this
my
friend
said
jordan
what
i
ask
of
your
friendship
i
wish
you
to
study
the
question
and
tell
me
what
you
yourself
would
do
if
you
were
in
my
place
he
recapitulated
the
whole
business
and
explained
how
he
himself
regarded
it
he
would
long
since
have
rid
himself
of
the
if
it
had
not
so
to
say
continued
working
of
its
own
accord
in
the
manner
regulated
by
routine
the
profits
remained
sufficient
but
holding
himself
to
be
rich
enough
he
did
not
take
them
into
account
and
on
the
other
hand
had
he
been
minded
to
increase
them
double
or
treble
them
as
ambition
might
dictate
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
renew
a
part
of
the
plant
improve
the
systems
employed
and
in
a
word
devote
oneself
to
them
entirely
that
was
a
thing
which
he
could
not
and
would
not
do
the
more
particularly
as
those
ancient
whose
methods
to
him
seemed
so
childish
and
barbarous
possessed
no
interest
for
him
and
could
be
of
no
help
in
the
experiments
of
electrical
smelting
in
which
he
was
now
passionately
absorbed
so
he
let
the
furnace
go
occupied
himself
with
it
as
little
as
possible
whilst
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
get
rid
of
it
altogether
understand
my
friend
do
you
he
said
to
luc
now
you
see
all
at
once
old
laroche
dies
and
the
whole
management
and
all
its
worries
fall
on
my
shoulders
again
you
ca
imagine
what
a
lot
of
things
ought
to
be
done
a
man
lifetime
would
scarcely
suffice
if
one
wished
to
deal
with
the
matter
seriously
for
my
part
nothing
in
the
world
would
induce
me
to
relinquish
my
studies
my
investigations
the
best
course
therefore
is
to
sell
and
i
am
virtually
ready
to
do
so
still
first
of
all
i
should
much
like
to
have
your
opinion
luc
understood
jordan
views
and
thought
them
reasonable
doubt
he
answered
can
not
change
your
work
and
habits
your
whole
life
you
yourself
and
the
world
would
both
lose
too
much
by
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
you
might
give
the
matter
a
little
more
thought
for
perhaps
there
are
other
solutions
possible
besides
in
order
to
sell
you
must
find
a
purchaser
i
have
a
purchaser
jordan
resumed
has
long
desired
to
annex
the
of
la
crÃªcherie
to
the
of
the
abyss
he
has
sounded
me
already
and
i
have
only
to
make
a
sign
luc
had
started
on
hearing
delaveau
name
for
he
now
at
last
understood
why
the
latter
had
shown
himself
so
anxious
and
so
pressing
in
his
inquiries
and
as
his
host
who
had
noticed
his
gesture
inquired
if
he
had
anything
to
say
against
the
manager
of
the
abyss
he
responded
no
i
think
as
you
yourself
do
that
he
is
an
active
and
intelligent
man
is
the
very
point
continued
jordan
business
would
be
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
it
would
be
necessary
i
think
to
come
to
certain
arrangements
such
as
agreeing
to
payments
at
long
intervals
for
boisgelin
has
no
capital
at
liberty
but
that
does
matter
i
can
wait
a
guarantee
on
the
abyss
would
suffice
me
then
looking
luc
full
in
the
face
he
concluded
do
you
advise
me
to
finish
with
the
matter
and
treat
with
delaveau
the
young
man
did
not
immediately
reply
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
and
repugnance
was
rising
within
him
what
could
it
be
why
should
he
experience
such
indignation
such
anger
with
himself
as
if
by
advising
his
friend
to
hand
the
over
to
that
man
delaveau
he
would
be
committing
some
bad
action
which
would
for
ever
leave
him
full
of
remorse
he
could
find
no
good
reason
for
advising
any
other
course
thus
he
at
last
replied
that
you
have
said
to
me
is
certainly
very
reasonable
and
i
can
not
do
otherwise
than
approve
of
your
views
and
yet
you
might
do
well
in
giving
the
matter
a
little
more
thought
sÅurette
had
hitherto
listened
very
attentively
without
intervening
she
seemed
to
share
luc
covert
uneasiness
and
now
and
again
glanced
at
him
anxiously
whilst
waiting
for
his
decision
smeltery
is
not
alone
in
question
she
at
last
exclaimed
is
also
the
mine
all
that
rocky
land
which
can
not
be
separated
from
the
furnace
so
it
seems
to
me
but
her
brother
eager
to
get
rid
of
the
whole
affair
made
an
impatient
gesture
saying
shall
take
the
land
as
well
if
he
desires
it
what
can
we
do
with
it
a
mass
of
peeling
calcined
rock
amongst
which
the
very
nettles
refuse
to
grow
it
has
no
value
whatever
nowadays
since
the
mine
can
no
longer
be
worked
it
quite
certain
that
it
can
no
longer
be
worked
insisted
sÅurette
remember
monsieur
froment
that
you
told
us
one
evening
in
paris
that
the
ironmasters
in
eastern
france
had
managed
to
make
use
of
most
defective
ore
by
subjecting
it
to
some
chemical
treatment
why
has
that
process
never
been
tried
here
jordan
raised
his
arms
towards
the
ceiling
in
a
fit
of
despair
why
my
dear
he
cried
laroche
was
deficient
in
all
initiative
because
i
myself
have
never
had
time
to
attend
to
the
matter
because
things
worked
in
a
certain
way
and
could
not
be
got
to
work
otherwise
if
i
selling
the
property
it
precisely
because
i
do
want
to
hear
it
mentioned
again
for
it
is
radically
impossible
for
me
to
direct
the
business
and
the
mere
thought
of
it
makes
me
he
had
risen
and
his
sister
seeing
him
so
agitated
remained
silent
for
fear
lest
in
provoking
a
dispute
she
might
throw
him
into
a
fever
are
moments
he
continued
i
think
of
sending
for
delaveau
so
that
he
may
take
everything
whether
he
pays
or
not
i
am
not
hard
up
for
money
it
like
those
electrical
furnaces
which
so
greatly
impassion
me
i
have
never
once
thought
of
employing
them
myself
and
of
coining
money
with
them
for
as
soon
as
i
solve
all
the
difficulties
in
my
way
i
shall
give
my
invention
to
everybody
so
as
to
help
on
universal
prosperity
and
happiness
well
then
it
is
understood
as
our
friend
considers
my
plan
to
be
a
reasonable
one
we
will
study
the
conditions
of
sale
together
and
then
finish
everything
luc
made
no
response
a
feeling
of
repugnance
still
possessed
him
and
he
did
not
wish
to
pledge
himself
too
far
but
jordan
became
yet
more
excited
and
ended
by
suggesting
that
they
should
go
up
to
see
the
furnace
the
more
especially
as
he
wished
to
ascertain
how
things
had
gone
there
during
his
three
days
absence
am
not
without
anxiety
said
he
laroche
has
been
dead
a
week
i
have
not
replaced
him
i
have
let
my
morfain
direct
the
work
he
is
a
capital
fellow
he
was
born
up
yonder
and
grew
up
amidst
the
fires
nevertheless
the
responsibility
is
heavy
for
a
mere
workman
such
as
he
is
sÅurette
alarmed
by
her
brother
suggestion
intervened
entreatingly
martial
she
cried
have
only
just
come
back
from
a
long
journey
and
yet
tired
as
you
must
be
you
want
to
go
out
again
at
ten
at
night
jordan
thereupon
became
very
gentle
again
and
kissed
her
worry
little
one
said
he
know
that
i
never
attempt
more
than
i
feel
i
can
do
i
assure
you
that
i
shall
sleep
the
better
after
making
certain
that
things
are
all
right
it
is
not
a
cold
night
and
besides
i
will
put
on
my
fur
coat
sÅurette
herself
fastened
a
thick
scarf
about
his
neck
and
accompanied
him
and
luc
down
the
steps
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
night
was
really
mild
it
was
indeed
a
delightful
one
the
trees
the
rivulets
and
the
fields
all
slumbered
beneath
the
heavens
which
spread
out
like
a
canopy
of
dark
velvet
spangled
with
stars
am
confiding
him
to
your
care
monsieur
froment
said
sÅurette
referring
to
her
brother
not
let
him
remain
out
late
the
two
men
at
once
began
to
climb
a
narrow
stairway
which
was
cut
out
in
the
rocks
behind
the
house
and
ascended
to
the
stony
landing
whereon
the
furnace
stood
up
the
huge
ridge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
it
was
a
labyrinthine
stairway
of
infinite
charm
winding
between
pines
and
climbing
plants
at
each
bend
on
raising
one
head
one
perceived
the
black
pile
of
the
smeltery
standing
forth
more
and
more
plainly
against
the
blue
the
strange
silhouettes
of
various
mechanical
adjuncts
showing
forth
fantastically
around
the
central
pile
jordan
went
up
the
first
with
light
short
steps
and
as
he
was
at
last
reaching
the
landing
he
paused
before
a
pile
of
rocks
among
which
a
little
light
gleamed
like
a
star
a
minute
he
said
want
to
make
sure
whether
morfain
is
at
home
or
not
at
home
asked
luc
in
astonishment
here
in
these
old
grottoes
which
he
has
turned
into
a
kind
of
to
which
he
clings
most
obstinately
with
his
son
and
daughter
in
spite
of
all
the
offers
that
i
have
made
of
providing
him
with
a
little
house
all
along
the
gorge
of
brias
quite
a
number
of
poor
people
dwelt
in
similar
cavities
morfain
for
his
part
remained
there
from
taste
for
there
forty
years
previously
he
had
first
seen
the
light
and
moreover
he
was
thus
close
beside
his
work
that
furnace
which
was
at
once
his
life
his
prison
and
his
empire
moreover
if
he
had
chosen
a
prehistoric
dwelling
he
had
behaved
like
a
civilised
man
of
the
caves
closing
both
sides
of
his
grotto
with
a
substantial
wall
and
providing
a
stout
door
and
some
windows
fitted
with
little
panes
of
glass
inside
there
were
three
rooms
the
bedroom
shared
by
the
father
and
the
son
the
daughter
bedroom
and
the
common
room
which
served
at
once
as
kitchen
and
workshop
and
all
three
chambers
were
very
clean
with
their
walls
and
their
vaulted
roof
of
stone
and
their
substantial
if
roughly
hewn
furniture
as
jordan
had
said
the
morfains
from
father
to
son
had
been
at
la
crÃªcherie
the
grandfather
had
helped
to
found
the
establishment
and
after
an
uninterrupted
family
reign
of
more
than
eighty
years
the
grandson
now
kept
watch
over
the
tappings
like
some
indisputable
title
of
nobility
the
hereditary
character
of
his
calling
filled
morfain
with
pride
his
wife
had
now
been
dead
four
years
leaving
him
a
son
then
sixteen
and
a
daughter
then
fourteen
years
of
age
the
lad
had
immediately
begun
to
work
at
the
furnace
and
the
girl
had
taken
care
of
the
two
men
cooking
their
meals
sweeping
and
cleaning
the
like
a
good
housewife
in
this
wise
had
the
days
gone
by
the
girl
was
now
eighteen
and
the
lad
twenty
and
the
father
quietly
watched
his
race
continuing
pending
the
time
when
he
might
hand
over
the
furnace
to
his
son
even
as
his
father
had
transmitted
it
to
him
so
you
are
here
morfain
said
jordan
when
he
had
pushed
open
the
door
which
was
merely
closed
by
a
latch
have
just
returned
home
and
i
wanted
to
know
how
things
were
getting
on
within
the
rocky
cavity
lighted
by
a
small
and
smoky
lamp
the
father
and
son
sat
at
table
eating
some
soup
a
mess
of
broth
and
vegetables
before
starting
on
their
night
work
whilst
the
daughter
stood
in
the
rear
serving
them
and
their
huge
shadows
seemed
to
fill
the
place
which
was
very
solemn
and
silent
at
last
in
a
gruff
voice
morfain
slowly
answered
had
a
bad
business
monsieur
jordan
but
i
hope
that
things
will
be
quiet
now
he
rose
to
his
feet
as
did
his
son
and
stood
there
between
the
lad
and
the
girl
all
three
of
them
strongly
built
and
of
such
lofty
stature
that
their
heads
almost
touched
the
rough
smoky
stone
vault
which
served
as
a
ceiling
to
the
room
one
might
have
taken
them
for
three
apparitions
of
the
vanished
ages
some
family
of
mighty
toilers
whose
long
efforts
throughout
the
centuries
had
subjugated
nature
luc
gazed
with
amazement
at
morfain
a
veritable
colossus
one
of
the
vulcans
of
old
by
whom
fire
was
first
conquered
he
had
an
enormous
head
with
a
broad
face
ravined
and
scorched
by
the
flames
his
brow
was
a
bossy
one
his
eyes
glowed
like
live
coals
his
nose
showed
like
an
eagle
beak
between
his
cheeks
which
looked
as
if
they
had
been
ravaged
by
some
flow
of
lava
and
his
swollen
twisted
mouth
was
of
a
tawny
redness
like
that
of
a
burn
while
his
hands
had
the
colour
and
the
strength
of
pincers
of
old
steel
then
luc
glanced
at
the
son
as
he
was
called
this
nickname
having
been
given
him
because
in
childhood
he
had
been
accustomed
to
pronounce
certain
words
badly
and
further
had
one
day
narrowly
missed
losing
his
little
fingers
in
some
which
was
scarcely
cold
he
again
was
a
colossus
almost
as
huge
as
his
father
whose
square
face
imperious
nose
and
flaming
eyes
he
had
inherited
but
he
had
been
less
hardened
less
marked
by
fire
and
besides
he
could
read
and
his
features
were
softened
and
brightened
by
dawning
powers
of
thought
finally
luc
gazed
at
the
daughter
as
her
father
had
ever
lovingly
called
her
so
blue
indeed
were
her
great
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
goddess
lightly
and
infinitely
blue
and
so
large
that
in
all
her
face
one
was
conscious
of
nothing
else
save
that
celestial
blueness
she
was
a
goddess
of
lofty
stature
of
simple
yet
magnificent
comeliness
the
most
beautiful
the
most
taciturn
the
wildest
creature
of
the
region
yet
one
who
in
her
wildness
dreamt
read
books
and
saw
from
afar
off
the
approach
of
things
that
her
father
had
never
seen
and
the
unconfessed
expectation
of
which
made
her
quiver
luc
marvelled
at
the
sight
of
those
three
creatures
of
heroic
build
that
family
in
which
he
detected
all
the
long
overpowering
labour
of
mankind
on
its
onward
march
all
the
pride
begotten
of
painful
effort
incessantly
renewed
all
the
ancient
nobility
that
springs
from
deadly
toil
but
jordan
had
become
anxious
bad
business
morfain
said
he
was
that
monsieur
jordan
one
of
the
twyers
got
stopped
up
for
two
days
i
fancied
that
we
were
going
to
have
a
misfortune
and
i
did
sleep
for
thought
of
it
it
grieved
me
so
much
that
a
thing
like
that
should
happen
to
me
just
when
you
were
away
it
best
to
go
and
see
if
the
time
we
shall
be
running
the
two
men
finished
their
soup
standing
hastily
swallowing
large
spoonfuls
of
it
whilst
the
girl
already
began
to
wipe
the
table
they
rarely
spoke
together
a
gesture
or
a
glance
sufficed
for
them
to
understand
each
other
nevertheless
the
father
affectionately
softening
his
gruff
voice
said
to
can
put
out
the
light
you
need
not
wait
for
us
we
shall
have
a
rest
up
above
then
whilst
morfain
and
went
off
in
front
accompanying
jordan
luc
who
was
in
the
rear
glanced
round
and
on
the
threshold
of
that
barbarian
home
he
perceived
standing
erect
tall
and
superb
like
some
of
the
ancient
days
whilst
her
large
azure
eyes
wandered
dreamily
far
away
into
the
clear
night
the
black
pile
of
the
furnace
soon
arose
before
the
young
man
view
it
was
of
a
very
ancient
pattern
heavy
and
squat
not
more
than
fifty
feet
in
height
but
by
degrees
various
improvements
had
been
added
new
organs
as
it
were
which
had
ended
by
forming
a
little
village
around
it
the
running
hall
floored
with
fine
sand
looked
light
and
elegant
with
its
iron
framework
roofed
with
tiles
then
on
the
left
inside
a
large
glazed
shed
was
the
blast
apparatus
with
its
steam
engine
whilst
on
the
right
rose
the
two
groups
of
lofty
cylinders
those
in
which
the
combustible
gases
became
purified
and
those
in
which
they
served
to
warm
the
blast
from
the
engine
in
order
that
it
might
reach
the
furnace
burning
hot
and
in
this
wise
hasten
combustion
and
there
were
also
a
number
of
and
a
whole
system
of
piping
which
kept
moisture
ever
trickling
down
the
sides
of
the
brick
walls
in
order
to
cool
them
and
diminish
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
awful
fire
raging
within
thus
the
monster
virtually
disappeared
beneath
the
intricate
medley
of
its
adjuncts
a
conglomeration
of
buildings
a
bristling
of
iron
tanks
an
entanglement
of
big
metal
pipes
the
whole
forming
an
extraordinary
jumble
which
at
especially
displayed
the
most
barbarous
fantastic
silhouettes
above
beside
the
rock
one
perceived
the
bridge
which
brought
the
trucks
laden
with
ore
and
fuel
to
the
level
of
the
mouth
of
the
furnace
below
the
kieve
reared
its
black
cone
and
then
from
the
belly
downward
a
powerful
metal
armature
sustained
the
brickwork
which
supported
the
water
conduits
and
the
four
twyers
finally
at
the
bottom
there
was
but
the
crucible
with
its
taphole
closed
with
a
bung
of
refractory
clay
but
what
a
gigantic
beast
the
whole
made
a
beast
of
disquieting
bewildering
shape
which
devoured
stones
and
gave
out
metal
in
fusion
moreover
was
there
scarcely
a
sound
scarcely
a
light
that
mighty
digestion
apparently
preferred
silence
and
gloom
one
could
only
hear
the
faint
trickling
of
the
water
running
down
the
sides
of
the
bricks
and
the
ceaseless
distant
rumbling
of
the
blast
apparatus
in
the
and
the
only
lights
were
those
of
three
or
four
lanterns
gleaming
amidst
the
darkness
which
the
shadows
of
the
huge
buildings
rendered
the
more
dense
moreover
only
a
few
pale
figures
were
seen
flitting
about
the
eight
smelters
of
the
who
wandered
hither
and
thither
whilst
waiting
for
the
next
on
the
platform
of
the
mouth
of
the
furnace
up
above
one
could
not
even
discern
the
men
who
silently
obeying
the
signals
sent
them
from
below
poured
into
the
furnace
the
requisite
charges
of
ore
and
fuel
and
there
was
not
a
cry
not
a
flash
of
light
it
was
all
dim
mute
labour
something
mighty
and
savage
accomplished
in
the
gloom
jordan
however
moved
by
the
bad
news
given
him
had
reverted
to
his
dream
and
pointing
to
the
pile
of
buildings
he
said
to
luc
who
had
now
joined
him
see
it
my
friend
now
am
i
not
right
in
wishing
to
do
away
with
all
that
in
wishing
to
replace
such
a
cumbersome
monster
which
entails
such
painful
toil
by
my
battery
of
electrical
furnaces
which
would
be
so
clean
so
simple
so
easily
managed
since
the
day
when
the
first
men
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
to
melt
ore
by
mingling
it
with
branches
which
they
set
alight
there
has
really
been
little
change
in
the
methods
employed
they
are
still
childish
and
primitive
our
are
mere
adaptations
of
the
prehistoric
pits
changed
into
hollow
columns
and
enlarged
according
to
requirements
and
one
continues
throwing
in
the
ore
and
the
combustible
pell
mell
and
burning
them
together
one
might
take
such
a
furnace
to
be
some
infernal
animal
down
whose
throat
one
is
for
ever
pouring
food
compounded
of
coal
and
oxide
of
iron
which
the
beast
digests
amidst
a
hurricane
of
fire
and
which
it
gives
out
down
below
in
the
form
of
fused
metal
whilst
the
gases
the
dust
the
slag
of
every
kind
goes
off
elsewhere
and
observe
that
the
whole
operation
rests
in
the
slow
descent
of
the
digested
substances
in
total
absolute
digestion
for
the
object
of
all
the
improvements
hitherto
effected
has
been
to
facilitate
it
formerly
there
was
no
blast
no
blowing
apparatus
and
fusion
was
therefore
slower
and
more
defective
then
cold
air
was
employed
and
next
it
was
perceived
that
a
better
result
was
obtained
by
heating
the
air
at
last
came
the
idea
of
heating
that
air
by
borrowing
from
the
furnace
itself
the
gases
which
had
formerly
burnt
at
its
mouth
in
a
plume
of
flames
and
in
this
wise
many
external
organs
have
been
added
to
our
but
in
spite
of
every
improvement
in
spite
of
their
huge
proportions
they
have
remained
childish
and
have
even
grown
more
and
more
delicate
liable
to
frequent
accidents
ah
you
ca
imagine
the
illnesses
which
fall
upon
such
a
monster
there
is
no
puny
sickly
little
child
in
the
whole
world
whose
daily
digestion
gives
as
much
anxiety
to
his
parents
as
a
monster
like
this
gives
to
those
in
charge
of
it
day
and
night
incessantly
two
shifts
each
of
six
loaders
up
above
and
eight
smelters
down
below
with
foremen
an
engineer
and
so
forth
are
on
the
spot
busy
with
the
food
supplied
to
the
beast
and
the
output
it
yields
and
at
the
slightest
disturbance
if
the
metal
run
out
should
not
be
satisfactory
everybody
is
in
a
state
of
alarm
for
five
years
now
this
furnace
has
been
alight
never
for
a
single
minute
has
the
internal
fire
ceased
to
perform
its
work
and
it
may
burn
another
five
years
in
the
same
way
before
it
is
extinguished
to
allow
of
repairs
being
made
and
if
those
in
charge
tremble
and
watch
so
carefully
over
the
work
it
is
because
there
is
the
everlasting
possibility
that
the
fire
may
go
out
of
itself
through
some
accident
of
unforeseen
gravity
in
the
monster
bowels
and
to
go
out
to
become
extinguished
means
death
ah
those
little
electrical
furnaces
of
mine
which
lads
might
work
they
wo
disturb
anybody
rest
at
nights
and
they
will
be
so
healthy
and
so
active
and
so
docile
luc
could
not
help
laughing
amused
by
the
loving
passion
which
entered
into
jordan
scientific
researches
however
they
had
now
been
joined
by
morfain
and
and
the
former
under
the
pale
gleam
of
a
lantern
pointed
to
one
of
the
four
pipes
which
at
a
height
of
nine
or
ten
feet
penetrated
the
monster
flanks
it
was
that
twyer
which
got
stopped
up
monsieur
jordan
he
said
unfortunately
i
had
gone
home
to
bed
so
that
i
only
noticed
what
was
the
matter
the
next
day
as
the
blast
did
not
penetrate
a
chill
occurred
and
a
quantity
of
matter
got
together
and
hardened
nothing
more
went
down
but
i
only
became
aware
of
the
trouble
at
the
moment
of
tapping
on
seeing
the
slag
come
out
in
a
thick
pulp
which
was
already
black
and
you
can
understand
my
fright
for
i
remembered
our
misfortune
ten
years
ago
when
one
had
to
demolish
a
part
of
the
furnace
after
a
similar
occurrence
never
before
had
morfain
spoken
so
many
words
at
a
stretch
his
voice
trembled
as
he
recalled
the
former
accident
for
no
more
terrible
illness
can
fall
on
the
monster
than
one
of
those
chills
which
solidify
the
ore
and
convert
it
into
so
much
rock
the
result
is
deadly
when
one
is
unable
to
relight
the
brasier
by
degrees
the
whole
mass
becomes
chilled
and
adheres
to
the
furnace
and
then
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
but
to
demolish
the
pile
raze
it
to
the
ground
like
some
old
tower
chokeful
of
stones
what
did
you
do
jordan
inquired
morfain
did
not
immediately
answer
he
had
ended
by
loving
that
monster
whose
flow
of
glowing
lava
had
scorched
his
face
for
more
than
thirty
years
it
was
like
a
giant
a
master
a
god
of
fire
which
he
adored
bending
beneath
the
rude
tyranny
of
the
worship
that
had
been
forced
upon
him
the
moment
he
reached
man
estate
as
his
sole
means
of
procuring
daily
bread
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
read
he
had
not
been
touched
by
the
new
spirit
which
was
abroad
he
experienced
no
feelings
of
rebellion
but
cheerfully
accepted
his
life
of
hard
servitude
vain
of
his
strong
arms
his
hourly
battles
with
the
flames
his
fidelity
to
that
crouching
colossus
over
whose
digestion
he
watched
without
ever
a
thought
of
going
out
on
strike
and
his
barbarous
and
terrible
god
had
become
his
passion
his
faith
in
that
divinity
was
instinct
with
secret
tenderness
and
he
still
quivered
with
anxiety
at
the
thought
of
the
dangerous
attack
from
which
he
had
saved
his
idol
thanks
to
extraordinary
efforts
of
devotion
i
did
he
at
last
responded
i
began
by
trebling
the
charges
of
coal
and
then
i
tried
to
clear
the
twyer
by
working
the
blast
apparatus
as
i
had
sometimes
seen
monsieur
laroche
do
but
the
attack
was
already
too
serious
and
we
had
to
disjoint
the
twyer
and
attack
the
stoppage
with
bars
ah
it
was
an
easy
job
and
we
lost
some
of
our
strength
in
doing
it
all
the
same
we
at
last
got
the
air
to
pass
and
i
was
better
pleased
when
among
the
slag
this
morning
i
found
some
remnants
of
ore
for
i
realised
that
the
matter
which
had
set
had
got
broken
up
again
and
carried
away
everything
is
once
more
well
alight
now
and
we
shall
be
doing
good
work
again
besides
it
will
soon
be
easy
to
see
how
things
are
the
next
run
will
tell
us
although
he
was
exhausted
by
such
a
long
discourse
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
really
believe
monsieur
jordan
that
i
should
have
gone
up
above
and
flung
myself
into
the
mouth
if
i
had
not
had
better
news
to
give
you
this
evening
i
only
a
workman
a
smelter
in
whom
you
had
confidence
giving
me
a
gentleman
post
an
post
and
just
fancy
me
letting
the
furnace
go
out
and
telling
you
on
your
return
home
that
it
was
dead
ah
no
indeed
i
have
died
too
i
have
been
to
bed
for
two
nights
now
i
kept
watch
here
like
i
did
beside
my
poor
wife
when
i
lost
her
and
at
present
i
may
admit
it
the
soup
which
you
found
me
eating
was
the
first
food
i
had
tasted
for
hours
for
i
could
eat
before
my
own
stomach
seemed
to
be
stopped
up
like
the
furnace
i
do
want
to
apologise
but
simply
to
let
you
know
how
happy
i
feel
at
not
having
failed
in
the
confidence
you
put
in
me
that
big
fellow
hardened
by
perpetual
fire
whose
limbs
were
like
steel
almost
wept
as
he
spoke
those
words
and
jordan
pressed
his
hands
affectionately
saying
know
how
valiant
you
are
my
good
morfain
i
know
that
if
a
disaster
had
happened
you
would
have
fought
on
to
the
very
end
meantime
had
stood
listening
in
the
gloom
intervening
neither
by
word
nor
gesture
he
only
moved
when
his
father
gave
him
an
order
respecting
the
tapping
every
hours
the
metal
was
run
out
five
times
at
intervals
of
nearly
five
hours
the
charge
which
might
be
eighty
tons
a
day
was
at
that
moment
reduced
to
about
fifty
which
would
give
runs
of
ten
tons
each
by
the
faint
light
of
the
lanterns
the
needful
arrangements
were
made
in
silence
channels
and
panels
for
casting
were
prepared
in
the
fine
sand
of
the
large
hall
and
then
before
running
out
the
metal
the
only
thing
remaining
to
be
done
was
to
get
rid
of
the
slag
thus
the
shadowy
forms
of
workmen
were
seen
passing
slowly
busily
engaged
in
operations
which
could
be
only
dimly
distinguished
whilst
amidst
the
heavy
silence
which
prevailed
within
the
squatting
idol
one
still
heard
nothing
save
the
trickling
of
the
drops
of
water
which
were
coursing
down
its
sides
jordan
morfain
inquired
you
like
to
see
the
slag
run
out
jordan
and
luc
followed
him
and
a
few
steps
brought
them
to
a
hillock
formed
of
an
accumulation
of
waste
the
aperture
was
on
the
side
of
the
furnace
and
the
slag
was
already
pouring
out
in
a
flood
of
sparkling
dross
as
if
the
cauldron
of
fusing
metal
were
being
skimmed
the
matter
was
like
thick
pulp
lava
flowing
slowly
along
and
falling
into
waggonets
of
sheet
iron
where
it
at
once
became
dim
colour
good
you
see
monsieur
jordan
resumed
morfain
gaily
we
are
out
of
trouble
that
sure
you
see
you
see
then
he
brought
them
back
to
the
in
front
of
the
furnace
whose
vague
dimness
was
so
faintly
illumined
by
the
lanterns
with
one
lunge
of
his
strong
young
arms
had
just
thrust
a
bar
into
the
bung
of
refractory
clay
which
closed
the
and
now
the
eight
men
of
the
night
shift
wore
rhythmically
ramming
the
bar
in
further
their
black
figures
could
scarcely
be
discerned
and
one
only
heard
the
dull
blows
of
the
rammer
then
all
at
once
a
dazzling
star
as
it
were
appeared
a
small
through
which
showed
the
inner
fire
but
as
yet
there
was
only
a
faint
trickling
of
the
liquid
metal
and
had
to
take
another
bar
thrust
it
in
and
turn
it
round
and
round
with
herculean
efforts
in
order
to
enlarge
the
aperture
then
came
the
the
flood
rushed
out
tumultuously
a
river
of
fusing
metal
rolled
along
the
channel
in
the
sand
and
then
spread
out
filling
the
moulds
and
forming
blazing
pools
whose
glow
and
heat
quite
scorched
the
eyes
of
the
beholders
and
from
that
channel
and
those
sheets
of
fire
rose
a
crop
of
sparks
blue
sparks
of
delicate
ethereality
and
fusees
of
gold
delightfully
refined
a
florescence
of
cornflowers
as
it
were
amidst
a
growth
of
whenever
any
obstacle
of
damp
sand
was
encountered
both
the
sparks
and
the
fusees
increased
in
number
and
rose
to
a
great
height
in
a
bouquet
of
splendour
and
all
at
once
as
if
some
miraculous
sun
had
risen
an
intense
dawn
burst
over
everything
casting
a
great
glare
upon
the
furnace
and
throwing
a
glow
as
of
sunshine
upward
to
the
roof
of
the
hall
whose
every
girder
and
joist
showed
forth
distinctly
the
neighbouring
buildings
the
monster
various
organs
sprang
out
of
the
darkness
together
with
the
men
of
the
hitherto
so
and
now
so
real
outlined
with
an
energy
and
splendour
never
to
be
forgotten
as
if
obscure
heroes
of
toil
that
they
were
they
suddenly
found
themselves
enveloped
by
a
nimbus
of
glory
and
the
great
glow
spread
to
all
the
surroundings
conjured
the
huge
ridge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
out
of
the
darkness
threw
reflections
even
upon
the
sleeping
roofs
of
beauclair
and
died
away
at
last
in
the
distance
far
over
the
great
plain
of
la
roumagne
is
superb
said
jordan
studying
the
quality
of
the
metal
by
the
colour
and
limpidity
of
the
flow
morfain
took
his
triumph
modestly
yes
monsieur
jordan
said
he
good
work
such
as
we
ought
to
turn
out
all
the
same
glad
you
came
to
have
a
look
you
wo
feel
anxious
now
luc
also
was
taking
an
interest
in
the
proceedings
so
great
was
the
heat
that
he
felt
his
skin
tingling
through
his
clothes
little
by
little
all
the
moulds
had
been
filled
and
the
sandy
hall
was
now
changed
into
an
incandescent
sea
and
when
the
ten
tons
of
liquid
metal
had
all
poured
forth
a
final
tempest
a
huge
rush
of
flames
and
sparks
came
from
the
cavity
the
was
emptying
the
crucible
the
blast
sweeping
through
it
in
all
freedom
like
some
hurricane
of
hell
but
the
pigs
were
now
growing
cold
their
blinding
white
light
became
pink
next
red
and
then
brown
the
sparks
too
ceased
to
rise
the
field
of
azure
cornflowers
and
golden
was
reaped
then
gloom
swiftly
fell
once
more
blotting
out
the
hall
and
the
furnace
and
all
the
adjoining
buildings
whilst
it
seemed
as
if
the
lanterns
had
been
lighted
up
afresh
and
of
the
workmen
one
could
again
only
distinguish
some
vague
figures
actively
bestirring
themselves
they
were
those
of
and
two
of
his
mates
who
were
again
plugging
the
with
refractory
clay
amidst
the
silence
which
was
now
deeper
than
ever
for
the
blast
machinery
had
been
stopped
to
permit
of
this
work
being
performed
say
morfain
my
good
fellow
jordan
suddenly
resumed
will
go
home
to
bed
wo
you
no
i
must
spend
the
night
here
the
man
answered
you
mean
to
stay
and
pass
a
third
sleepless
night
here
there
a
camp
bedstead
in
the
monsieur
jordan
and
one
sleeps
very
well
on
it
we
relieve
each
other
my
son
and
i
we
each
do
two
hours
sentry
duty
in
turn
that
useless
since
things
are
now
all
right
again
jordan
retorted
be
reasonable
morfain
and
go
and
sleep
at
home
no
monsieur
jordan
let
me
do
as
i
wish
there
no
more
danger
but
i
want
to
make
sure
how
things
go
until
it
will
please
me
to
do
so
thus
jordan
and
luc
after
shaking
hands
with
him
had
to
leave
him
there
and
luc
felt
extremely
moved
for
morfain
had
left
on
him
an
impression
of
great
loftiness
in
which
met
long
years
of
painful
and
docile
labour
all
the
nobility
of
the
crushing
toil
which
mankind
had
undertaken
in
the
hope
of
attaining
to
rest
and
happiness
it
had
all
begun
with
the
ancient
vulcans
who
had
subjugated
fire
in
those
heroic
times
which
jordan
had
recalled
when
the
first
smelters
had
reduced
their
ore
in
a
pit
dug
in
the
earth
in
which
they
lighted
wood
it
was
on
that
day
the
day
when
man
first
conquered
iron
and
fashioned
it
that
he
became
the
master
of
the
world
and
that
the
era
of
civilisation
first
began
morfain
dwelling
in
his
rocky
cave
and
for
whom
nothing
existed
apart
from
the
difficulties
and
the
glory
of
his
calling
seemed
to
luc
like
some
direct
descendant
of
those
primitive
toilers
whose
characteristics
still
lived
by
force
of
heredity
in
him
silent
and
resigned
as
he
was
giving
all
the
strength
of
his
muscles
without
ever
a
murmur
even
as
his
predecessors
had
done
at
the
dawn
of
human
society
ah
how
much
perspiration
had
streamed
forth
and
how
many
arms
had
toiled
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
during
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
and
yet
nothing
changed
fire
if
conquered
still
made
its
victims
still
had
its
slaves
those
who
fed
it
those
who
scorched
their
blood
in
subjugating
it
whilst
the
privileged
ones
of
the
earth
lived
in
idleness
in
homes
which
were
fresh
and
cool
morfain
like
some
legendary
hero
did
not
seem
even
to
suspect
the
existence
of
all
the
monstrous
iniquity
around
him
he
was
ignorant
of
rebellion
of
the
storm
growling
afar
he
remained
quite
impassive
at
his
deadly
post
there
where
his
sires
had
died
and
where
he
himself
would
die
and
luc
also
conjured
up
another
figure
that
of
bonnaire
another
hero
of
labour
one
who
struggled
against
the
oppressors
the
exploiters
in
order
that
justice
might
at
last
reign
and
who
devoted
himself
to
his
comrades
cause
even
to
the
point
of
giving
up
his
daily
bread
had
not
all
those
suffering
men
groaned
long
enough
beneath
their
burdens
and
however
admirable
might
be
their
toil
had
not
the
hour
struck
for
the
deliverance
of
the
slaves
in
order
that
they
might
at
last
become
free
citizens
in
a
fraternal
community
amidst
which
peace
would
spring
from
a
just
apportionment
of
labour
and
wealth
however
as
jordan
whilst
descending
the
steps
cut
in
the
rock
stopped
before
a
hut
to
give
an
order
an
unexpected
sight
met
luc
eyes
and
brought
his
emotion
to
a
climax
behind
some
bushes
amidst
some
scattered
rocks
he
distinctly
saw
two
shadowy
forms
passing
their
arms
encircled
each
other
waist
and
their
lips
were
meeting
in
a
kiss
luc
readily
recognised
the
girl
so
tall
she
was
so
fair
and
so
superb
she
was
none
other
than
the
maid
whose
great
blue
eyes
seemed
to
fill
her
face
and
the
lad
must
assuredly
be
achille
gourier
the
mayor
son
that
proud
and
handsome
youth
whose
demeanour
he
luc
had
noticed
at
la
guerdache
that
demeanour
so
expressive
of
contempt
for
the
rotting
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
revolting
sons
ever
shooting
fishing
and
roaming
he
spent
his
holidays
among
the
steep
paths
of
the
bleuse
mountains
beside
the
torrents
or
deep
in
the
pine
woods
and
doubtless
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
that
beautiful
shy
wild
girl
around
whom
so
many
admirers
prowled
in
vain
she
on
her
side
must
have
been
conquered
by
the
advent
of
that
prince
charming
who
brought
her
something
that
was
beyond
her
sphere
who
set
all
the
delightful
dreams
of
amidst
the
sternness
of
that
desert
was
it
not
that
which
dawned
in
blue
eyes
when
with
her
gaze
wandering
far
away
she
stood
so
thoughtful
on
the
threshold
of
her
mountain
cave
her
father
and
her
brother
were
watching
over
their
work
up
yonder
and
she
had
escaped
down
the
precipitous
paths
and
for
her
meant
that
tall
loving
lad
that
stripling
who
spoke
to
her
so
prettily
as
if
she
had
been
a
lady
and
vowed
that
he
would
love
her
for
ever
at
first
amidst
his
amazement
luc
felt
a
at
the
thought
of
how
grieved
the
father
would
be
should
he
hear
of
that
sweethearting
then
a
tender
feeling
took
possession
of
the
young
man
heart
a
caressing
breath
of
hope
came
to
him
at
the
sight
of
that
free
and
gentle
love
were
not
those
children
who
belonged
to
such
different
classes
preparing
amidst
their
play
their
kisses
the
advent
of
the
happier
morrow
the
great
reconciliation
which
would
at
last
lead
to
the
reign
of
justice
down
below
when
luc
and
jordan
reached
the
park
they
exchanged
a
few
more
words
have
caught
cold
i
hope
said
the
young
man
to
his
friend
sister
would
never
forgive
me
you
know
no
i
feel
quite
well
and
i
am
going
to
bed
in
the
best
of
spirits
for
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
i
intend
to
rid
myself
of
that
enterprise
since
it
does
not
interest
me
and
proves
such
a
constant
source
of
worry
for
a
moment
luc
remained
silent
for
uneasiness
had
returned
to
him
as
if
indeed
he
were
frightened
by
jordan
decision
however
as
he
left
his
friend
he
said
shaking
his
hand
for
the
last
time
wait
give
me
to
think
the
matter
over
we
will
have
another
talk
in
the
evening
and
afterwards
you
shall
come
to
a
decision
then
they
parted
for
the
night
luc
did
not
go
to
bed
immediately
he
occupied
in
the
pavilion
formerly
erected
for
michon
maternal
grandfather
the
spacious
room
where
the
doctor
had
spent
his
last
years
among
his
books
and
during
the
three
days
that
he
had
occupied
this
chamber
the
young
man
had
grown
fond
of
the
pleasantness
peacefulness
and
odour
of
work
that
filled
it
that
evening
however
the
fever
of
doubt
by
which
he
was
possessed
oppressed
him
and
throwing
one
of
the
windows
wide
open
he
leant
out
hoping
in
this
wise
to
calm
himself
a
little
before
he
went
to
bed
the
window
overlooked
the
road
leading
from
la
crÃªcherie
to
beauclair
in
front
spread
some
uncultivated
fields
strewn
with
rocks
and
beyond
them
one
could
distinguish
the
jumbled
roofs
of
the
sleeping
town
for
a
few
minutes
luc
remained
inhaling
the
gusts
of
air
which
arose
from
the
great
plain
of
la
roumagne
the
night
was
warm
and
moist
and
athwart
a
slight
haze
a
bluish
light
descended
from
the
starry
sky
luc
listened
to
the
distant
sounds
with
which
the
night
quivered
and
before
long
he
recognised
the
dull
rhythmical
blows
of
the
hammers
of
the
abyss
that
cyclopean
forge
whence
day
and
night
alike
there
came
a
clang
of
steel
then
he
raised
his
eyes
and
sought
the
black
silent
smeltery
of
la
crÃªcherie
but
it
was
now
mingled
with
the
inky
bar
which
the
promontory
of
the
bleuse
mountains
set
against
the
sky
lowering
his
eyes
he
at
last
directed
them
upon
the
roofs
of
the
town
whose
heavy
slumber
seemed
to
be
cradled
by
the
rhythmic
blows
of
the
hammers
those
blows
which
suggested
the
quick
and
difficult
breathing
of
some
giant
worker
some
prometheus
chained
to
eternal
toil
and
luc
feeling
of
uneasiness
was
increased
by
it
all
he
could
not
quiet
his
fever
the
people
and
the
things
that
he
had
beheld
during
those
last
three
days
crowded
upon
his
mind
passed
before
him
in
a
tragic
scramble
the
sense
of
which
he
strove
to
divine
and
the
problem
which
possessed
his
spirit
now
tortured
him
more
than
ever
assuredly
he
would
be
unable
to
sleep
until
he
found
a
means
of
solving
it
but
down
below
his
window
across
the
road
amongst
the
bushes
and
the
rocks
he
suddenly
heard
a
fresh
sound
something
so
light
so
faint
that
he
could
not
tell
what
it
might
be
was
it
the
beating
of
a
wings
the
rustle
of
an
insect
among
some
leaves
luc
gazed
down
and
could
see
nothing
save
the
swelling
darkness
that
spread
far
far
away
no
doubt
he
had
been
mistaken
but
the
sounds
reached
his
ears
again
and
even
seemed
to
come
nearer
interested
by
them
seized
with
a
strange
emotion
which
astonished
him
he
again
strove
to
penetrate
the
darkness
and
at
last
he
distinguished
a
vague
light
delicate
form
which
seemed
to
float
over
the
grass
and
still
he
was
unable
to
tell
what
that
form
might
be
and
was
willing
to
believe
himself
the
victim
of
some
delusion
when
with
a
nimble
spring
like
that
of
some
wild
goat
a
woman
crossed
the
road
and
lightly
threw
him
a
little
nosegay
which
brushed
against
his
face
like
a
caress
it
was
a
little
bunch
of
mountain
pansies
just
gathered
among
the
rocks
and
of
such
powerful
aroma
that
he
was
quite
perfumed
by
it
josine
he
divined
that
it
was
she
he
recognised
her
by
that
fresh
sign
of
her
heart
thankfulness
by
that
adorable
gesture
of
infinite
gratitude
and
it
all
seemed
to
him
exquisite
in
that
dimness
at
that
late
hour
though
he
could
not
tell
how
she
had
happened
to
be
there
whether
she
had
been
watching
for
his
return
and
how
she
could
have
contrived
to
come
unless
indeed
ragu
were
working
at
a
without
a
word
having
had
no
other
desire
than
that
of
expressing
her
feelings
by
the
gift
of
those
flowers
which
she
had
so
lightly
thrown
him
she
was
already
fleeing
disappearing
into
the
darkness
spread
over
the
uncultivated
moor
and
only
then
did
luc
distinguish
another
and
a
smaller
form
that
assuredly
of
nanet
bounding
along
near
her
they
both
vanished
and
then
he
again
heard
nought
save
the
hammers
of
the
abyss
ever
rhythmically
beating
in
the
distance
his
torment
was
not
passed
but
his
heart
had
been
warmed
by
a
glow
which
seemed
to
bring
him
invincible
strength
it
was
with
rapture
that
he
inhaled
the
little
nosegay
ah
the
power
of
kindness
which
is
the
bond
of
brotherhood
the
power
of
tenderness
by
which
alone
happiness
is
created
the
power
of
love
which
will
save
and
make
the
world
anew
it
may
be
presumed
that
zola
means
centigrade
the
meaning
is
dolt
being
a
contraction
of
v
luc
went
to
bed
and
put
out
the
light
hoping
that
his
weariness
of
mind
and
body
would
bring
him
sound
and
refreshing
sleep
in
which
his
fever
would
at
last
be
dispelled
but
when
the
large
room
sank
into
silence
and
obscurity
around
him
he
found
himself
quite
unable
to
close
his
eyes
they
stared
into
the
darkness
and
terrible
insomnia
kept
him
burning
hot
still
a
prey
to
his
one
obstinate
idea
josine
was
ever
rising
before
him
coming
back
again
and
again
with
her
childish
face
and
doleful
charm
he
once
more
saw
her
in
tears
standing
full
of
terror
as
she
waited
near
the
gate
of
the
abyss
he
again
saw
her
standing
in
the
then
thrown
into
the
street
by
ragu
in
so
brutal
a
fashion
that
blood
gushed
from
her
maimed
hand
and
he
saw
her
too
on
the
bench
near
the
mionne
forsaken
amidst
the
tragic
night
satisfying
her
hunger
like
some
poor
wandering
animal
and
having
no
prospect
before
her
save
a
final
tumble
into
the
gutter
and
now
after
those
three
days
of
unexpected
almost
unconscious
inquiry
to
which
destiny
had
led
him
all
that
he
luc
had
beheld
of
unjustly
apportioned
toil
toil
derided
as
if
it
were
shame
toil
conducting
to
the
most
atrocious
misery
for
the
vast
majority
of
mankind
became
in
his
eyes
synthetised
in
the
distressing
case
of
that
sorry
girl
whose
misfortunes
wrung
his
heart
visions
arose
thronging
around
him
pressing
forward
haunting
him
to
the
point
of
torture
he
beheld
terror
careering
through
the
black
streets
of
beauclair
along
which
tramped
all
the
disinherited
wretches
secretly
dreaming
of
vengeance
he
saw
reasoned
organised
and
fatal
revolution
dawning
in
such
homes
as
the
bonnaires
cold
bare
sorry
rooms
where
even
the
mere
necessaries
of
life
were
wanting
where
lack
of
work
compelled
the
toiler
to
tighten
his
waistband
and
left
the
family
starving
and
on
the
other
hand
he
beheld
at
la
guerdache
all
the
insolence
of
corrupting
luxury
all
the
poisonous
enjoyment
which
was
finishing
off
the
privileged
plutocrats
that
handful
of
satiated
with
idleness
gorged
to
stifling
point
with
all
the
iniquitous
wealth
which
they
stole
from
the
labour
and
the
tears
of
the
immense
majority
of
the
workers
and
even
at
la
crÃªcherie
that
wildly
lofty
where
not
one
worker
complained
the
long
efforts
of
mankind
were
stricken
so
to
say
by
a
curse
immobilised
in
eternal
dolour
without
hope
of
any
complete
freeing
of
the
race
of
its
final
deliverance
from
slavery
and
the
entry
of
one
and
all
into
the
city
of
justice
and
peace
and
luc
had
seen
and
heard
beauclair
cracking
upon
all
sides
for
the
fratricidal
warfare
was
not
waged
only
between
classes
its
destructive
ferment
was
perverting
families
a
blast
of
folly
and
hatred
was
sweeping
by
filling
every
heart
with
bitterness
monstrous
dramas
soiled
homes
that
should
have
been
cleanly
fathers
mothers
and
children
alike
rolled
into
the
sewers
folk
lied
unceasingly
they
stole
they
killed
and
at
the
end
of
wretchedness
and
hunger
came
crime
perforce
woman
selling
herself
man
sinking
to
drink
all
human
kind
becoming
a
rageful
beast
that
rushed
along
intent
solely
upon
satisfying
its
vices
many
were
the
frightful
signs
that
announced
the
inevitable
catastrophe
the
old
social
framework
was
about
to
topple
down
amidst
blood
and
mire
by
those
visions
of
shame
and
chastisement
weeping
with
all
the
human
tenderness
within
him
luc
then
again
saw
the
pale
phantom
of
josine
returning
from
the
depths
of
the
darkness
and
stretching
out
arms
of
entreaty
and
then
in
his
fancy
none
but
her
remained
it
was
upon
her
that
the
leprous
edifice
would
fall
she
became
as
it
were
the
one
victim
she
the
puny
little
workgirl
with
the
maimed
hand
who
was
starving
and
who
would
roll
into
the
gutter
a
pitiable
yet
charming
creature
in
whom
seemed
to
be
embodied
all
the
misery
that
arose
from
the
accursed
he
now
suffered
as
she
must
suffer
and
above
all
else
in
his
wild
dream
of
saving
beauclair
there
was
a
craving
to
save
her
if
some
superhuman
power
had
made
him
almighty
he
would
have
transformed
that
town
now
rotted
by
egotism
into
a
happy
abode
of
solidarity
in
order
that
she
might
be
happy
he
realised
at
present
that
this
dream
of
his
was
an
old
one
that
it
had
always
possessed
him
since
the
days
when
he
had
lived
in
one
of
the
poor
quarters
of
paris
among
the
obscure
heroes
and
the
dolorous
victims
of
labour
it
was
a
dream
into
which
entered
secret
disquietude
respecting
the
future
that
future
which
he
dared
not
predict
and
an
idea
that
some
mysterious
mission
had
been
confided
to
him
and
all
at
once
amidst
the
confusion
in
which
he
still
struggled
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
decisive
hour
had
come
josine
was
starving
josine
was
sobbing
and
that
could
be
allowed
no
longer
he
must
act
he
must
at
once
relieve
all
the
misery
and
all
the
suffering
in
order
that
things
so
iniquitous
might
cease
weary
as
he
was
however
he
at
last
fell
into
a
doze
in
the
midst
of
which
it
seemed
as
if
voices
were
calling
him
thus
before
long
he
awoke
with
a
start
and
then
the
voices
seemed
to
gather
strength
as
if
wildly
summoning
him
to
that
urgent
work
for
which
the
hour
had
struck
and
the
imperious
need
of
which
he
fully
recognised
though
how
to
accomplish
it
he
could
not
tell
and
above
all
other
appeals
he
finally
heard
the
call
of
a
very
gentle
voice
which
he
recognised
the
voice
of
josine
lamenting
and
entreating
from
that
moment
again
she
alone
seemed
to
be
present
he
could
feel
the
warm
caress
of
the
kiss
which
she
had
set
upon
his
hand
and
could
smell
the
little
bunch
of
pansies
which
she
had
thrown
him
as
he
stood
at
the
window
indeed
the
wild
fragrance
of
the
flowers
now
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
room
then
he
struggled
no
longer
he
lighted
his
candle
rose
and
for
a
few
minutes
walked
about
the
room
in
order
to
rid
his
brain
of
the
fixed
idea
which
oppressed
it
he
strove
to
think
of
nothing
he
looked
at
the
few
old
engravings
hanging
from
the
walls
he
looked
at
the
articles
of
furniture
which
spoke
of
doctor
simple
and
studious
habits
he
gazed
around
the
whole
room
in
which
a
deal
of
kindliness
good
sense
and
wisdom
seemed
to
have
lingered
at
last
his
attention
became
riveted
on
the
bookcase
it
was
a
rather
large
one
with
glass
doors
and
therein
the
former
and
fourierist
had
gathered
together
the
humanitarian
writings
which
had
fired
his
mind
in
youth
all
the
social
philosophers
all
the
precursors
all
the
apostles
of
the
new
gospel
figured
there
fourier
auguste
comte
proudhon
cabet
pierre
leroux
with
others
and
others
indeed
a
complete
collection
down
to
the
most
obscure
disciples
and
luc
candle
in
hand
read
the
names
and
titles
on
the
backs
of
the
volumes
counted
them
and
grew
astonished
at
their
number
at
the
fact
that
so
much
good
seed
should
have
been
cast
to
the
winds
that
so
many
good
words
should
be
slumbering
there
waiting
for
the
harvest
he
himself
had
read
widely
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
chief
passages
of
most
of
those
books
the
philosophical
economical
and
social
systems
of
their
authors
were
familiar
to
him
but
never
as
now
on
finding
these
authors
all
united
there
in
a
serried
phalanx
had
he
been
so
clearly
conscious
of
their
force
their
value
the
human
evolution
which
they
typified
they
formed
so
to
say
the
advance
guard
of
the
future
century
an
advance
guard
soon
to
be
followed
by
the
huge
army
of
the
nations
and
on
seeing
them
thus
side
by
side
peaceably
mingling
together
endowed
by
union
with
sovereign
strength
luc
was
particularly
struck
by
their
intense
brotherliness
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
contradictory
views
which
had
formerly
parted
them
of
the
desperate
battles
even
which
they
had
waged
together
but
they
now
seemed
to
have
become
all
brothers
reconciled
in
a
common
gospel
in
the
unique
and
final
truths
which
all
of
them
had
brought
and
that
which
arose
from
their
words
like
a
dawning
promise
was
that
religion
of
humanity
in
which
they
had
all
believed
their
love
for
the
disinherited
ones
of
the
world
their
hatred
of
all
social
injustice
their
faith
in
work
as
the
true
saviour
of
mankind
opening
the
bookcase
luc
wished
to
select
one
of
the
volumes
since
he
was
unable
to
sleep
he
would
read
a
few
pages
and
thus
take
patience
until
slumber
should
come
to
him
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
at
last
selected
a
very
little
volume
in
which
one
of
fourier
disciples
had
summed
up
the
whole
of
his
master
work
the
title
had
moved
the
young
man
would
he
not
find
in
that
book
a
few
pages
brimful
of
strength
and
hope
such
as
he
needed
thus
he
slipped
into
bed
again
and
began
to
read
and
soon
he
became
as
passionately
interested
in
his
reading
as
if
he
had
before
him
some
poignant
drama
in
which
the
fate
of
the
whole
human
race
was
decided
the
doctrines
thus
condensed
reduced
to
the
very
essence
of
the
truths
they
contained
acquired
extraordinary
power
fourier
genius
had
in
the
first
place
asserted
itself
in
turning
the
passions
of
man
into
the
very
forces
of
life
the
long
and
disastrous
error
of
catholicism
had
lain
in
ever
seeking
to
muzzle
the
passions
in
striving
to
kill
the
man
within
man
to
fling
him
like
a
slave
at
the
foot
of
a
deity
of
tyranny
and
nothingness
in
the
free
future
society
conceived
by
fourier
the
passions
were
to
produce
as
much
good
as
they
had
produced
evil
in
the
chained
and
terrorised
society
of
the
dead
centuries
they
constituted
immortal
desire
the
energy
which
raises
worlds
the
internal
furnace
of
will
and
strength
which
imparts
to
each
being
the
power
to
act
man
deprived
of
a
single
passion
would
be
mutilated
as
if
he
were
deprived
of
one
of
his
senses
instincts
hitherto
thrust
back
and
crushed
as
if
they
were
evil
beasts
would
when
once
they
were
freed
become
only
the
various
needs
of
universal
attraction
all
tending
towards
unity
striving
amidst
obstacles
to
meet
and
mingle
in
final
harmony
that
ultimate
expression
of
universal
happiness
and
there
were
really
no
egotists
no
idlers
there
were
only
men
hungering
for
unity
and
harmony
who
would
march
on
in
all
brotherliness
as
soon
as
they
should
see
that
the
road
was
wide
enough
for
all
to
pass
along
it
at
ease
and
happily
as
for
the
victims
of
the
heavy
servitude
that
oppressed
the
manual
toilers
who
were
angered
by
unjust
excessive
and
often
inappropriate
tasks
they
would
all
be
ready
to
work
right
joyfully
as
soon
as
simply
their
logical
chosen
share
of
the
great
common
labour
should
be
allotted
to
them
then
another
stroke
of
genius
on
fourier
part
was
the
restoration
of
work
to
a
position
of
honour
by
making
it
the
public
function
the
pride
health
gaiety
and
very
law
of
life
it
would
suffice
to
reorganise
work
in
order
to
reorganise
the
whole
of
society
of
which
work
would
be
the
one
civic
obligation
the
vital
rule
there
would
be
no
further
question
of
brutally
imposing
work
on
vanquished
men
mercenaries
crushed
down
and
treated
like
famished
beasts
of
burden
on
the
contrary
work
would
be
freely
accepted
by
all
allotted
according
to
tastes
and
natures
performed
during
the
few
hours
that
might
be
indispensable
and
constantly
varied
according
to
the
choice
of
the
voluntary
toilers
a
town
would
become
an
immense
hive
in
which
there
would
not
be
one
idler
and
in
which
each
citizen
would
contribute
his
share
towards
the
general
sum
of
labour
which
might
be
necessary
for
the
town
to
live
the
tendency
towards
unity
and
final
harmony
would
draw
the
inhabitants
together
and
compel
them
to
group
themselves
among
the
various
series
of
workers
and
the
whole
mechanism
would
rest
in
that
the
workman
choosing
the
task
which
he
could
perform
most
joyously
not
riveted
for
ever
to
one
and
the
same
calling
but
passing
from
one
form
of
work
to
another
moreover
the
world
would
not
be
revolutionised
all
of
a
sudden
the
beginnings
would
be
small
the
system
being
tried
first
of
all
in
some
township
of
a
few
thousand
souls
the
dream
would
then
approach
fulfilment
the
phalange
the
unit
at
the
base
of
the
great
human
army
would
be
created
the
phalanstery
the
common
house
would
be
built
at
first
too
one
would
simply
appeal
to
willing
men
and
link
them
together
in
such
wise
as
to
form
an
association
of
capital
work
and
talent
those
who
now
possessed
money
those
whose
arms
were
strong
and
those
who
had
brains
would
be
asked
to
come
to
an
understanding
and
combine
putting
their
various
means
together
they
would
produce
with
an
energy
and
an
abundance
far
greater
than
now
and
they
would
divide
the
profits
they
reaped
as
equitably
as
possible
until
the
day
came
when
capital
work
and
talent
might
be
blended
together
and
form
the
common
patrimony
of
a

certain
phrases
shone
forth
like

reason

truth
was

a
truth

became

eternal
work

to

neither

would

of

in

all

that

useless
and

to

suppressed
thus
commerce
as
it

corruption
upon
the

no

and
above

amidst
the
great
dawn
which
would
thus
have
risen
there
would
appear
justice
flaming
like

driving

was
reflecting
now
the
whole
great
heroic
nineteenth
century
spread
out
before
his
mind
eye
with
its
continuous
battling
its
dolorous
valiant
efforts
to
attain
to
truth
and
justice
the
irresistible
democratic
advance

of

of

brought
only
the
middle
classes
to
power
another
century
was
needed
for
the
evolution
to
become
complete
for
the
people
to
obtain
its
share
of
influence
seeds
germinated
however
in
the
old
and
often
ploughed
monarchical
soil
and
already
during
the
days
of

plainly
brought
forward

claims
of
the
workers

more
and
more
precise
and

egotistical
and
tyrannical
possession
was
in
their
turn
rotting
and
now
on
the
threshold
of
the
new
century
as
soon
as
the
spreading
onrush
of
the
masses
should
have
carried
the
old
social
framework
away
the
reoganisation
of
labour
would
prove
the
very
of
future
society
which
would
only
be
able
to
exist
by
a
just
apportionment
of
wealth
the
violent
crisis
which
had
overthrown
empires
when
the
old
world
passed
from
servitude
to
the
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
terrible
crisis
which
for
the
last
hundred
years
had
shaken
and
ravaged
nations
that
crisis
of
the
passing
through
successive
evolutions
and
transformations
and
tending
to
become
something
else
and
from
that
something
else

born
the
happy
and
brotherly
social
system
of
luc
gently
put
down
the
little
book
and
blew
out
his
light
he
had
grown
calmer
now
and
could
feel
that
peaceful
restoring
sleep
was
approaching
true
no
precise
answers
had
come
to
the
urgent
appeals
which
had
previously
upset
him
but
he
heard
those
appeals
no
more
it
was
as
if
the
disinherited
beings
who
had
raised
them
were
now
conscious
that
they
had
been
heard
and
were
taking
patience
seed
was
sown
and
the
harvest
would
rise
luc
himself
was
troubled
with
no
more
feverishness
he
felt
that
his
mind
was
pregnant
with
ideas
to
which
indeed
it
might
give
birth
on
the
very
morrow
if
his
night
slumber
should
be
good
and
he
ended
by
yielding
to
his
great
need
of
repose
and
fell
with
delight
into
a
deep
sleep
visited
by
genius
faith
and
will
when
he
awoke
at
seven
on
the
following
morning
his
first
thought
on
seeing
the
sun
rise
in
the
broad
clear
sky
was
to
go
out
without
warning
the
jordans
and
climb
the
rocky
stairway
leading
to
the
smeltery
he
wished
to
see
morfain
again
and
obtain
certain
information
from
him
in
this
respect
he
was
yielding
to
a
sudden
inspiration
with
reference
to
the
advice
which
jordan
had
asked
of
him
he
desired
above
all
to
arrive
at
some
precise
opinion
respecting
the
old
abandoned
mine
the
a
son
of
the
mountains
must
know
he
thought
every
stone
of
it
and
indeed
morfain
whom
he
found
up
and
about
after
his
night
spent
beside
the
furnace
which
decidedly
had
now
recovered
from
its
ailment
became
quite
impassioned
directly
the
mine
was
mentioned
to
him
he
had
always
had
an
idea
of
his
own
which
nobody
would
heed
although
he
had
often
given
expression
to
it
to
his
thinking
old
laroche
the
engineer
had
done
wrong
in
despairing
and
forsaking
the
mine
directly
the
working
of
it
had
failed
to
prove
remunerative
the
vein
which
had
been
followed
had
certainly
become
an
abominable
one
charged
with
sulphur
and
phosphates
to
such
a
degree
that
nothing
good
came
out
in
the
smelting
but
morfain
was
convinced
that
they
were
simply
crossing
a
bad
vein
and
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
carry
the
galleries
further
or
to
open
fresh
ones
at
a
point
of
the
gorge
which
he
designated
in
order
to
find
once
more
the
same
excellent
ore
as
formerly
and
he
based
his
opinion
upon
observation
upon
knowledge
of
all
the
rocks
of
the
region
which
he
had
scaled
and
explored
for
forty
years
as
he
put
it
he
was
not
a
man
of
science
he
was
only
a
poor
toiler
and
did
not
presume
to
compete
with
those
gentlemen
the
engineers
nevertheless
he
was
astonished
that
no
confidence
was
shown
in
his
keen
scent
and
that
his
superiors
should
have
simply
shrugged
their
shoulders
without
consenting
to
test
his
predictions
by
a
few
borings
the
man
quiet
confidence
impressed
luc
the
more
especially
since
he
was
inclined
to
pass
a
severe
judgment
on
the
inertia
of
old
laroche
who
had
left
the
mine
in
an
abandoned
state
even
after
the
discovery
of
the
chemical
process
which
would
have
allowed
the
defective
ore
to
be
profitably
utilised
that
alone
showed
into
what
slumberous
routine
the
working
of
the
furnace
had
fallen
the
mine
ought
to
be
worked
again
immediately
even
if
they
had
to
rest
content
with
treating
the
ore
chemically
but
what
would
it
be
if
morfain
convictions
should
be
realised
and
they
should
again
come
upon
rich
and
pure
lodes
thus
luc
immediately
accepted
the
proposal
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
direction
of
the
abandoned
galleries
in
order
that
the
other
might
explain
his
ideas
on
the
spot
that
clear
and
fresh
september
morning
the
walk
among
the
rocks
through
the
lonely
wilds
fragrant
with
lavender
was
delightful
during
three
hours
the
two
men
climbed
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
gorges
visiting
the
grottoes
following
the
ridges
where
the
rocks
jutted
up
through
the
soil
like
portions
of
the
skeleton
of
some
huge
buried
monster
and
by
degrees
morfain
conviction
gained
upon
luc
bringing
him
at
least
a
hope
that
there
in
that
spot
lay
a
treasure
which
man
in
his
sloth
had
passed
by
and
which
earth
the
inexhaustible
mother
was
prepared
to
yield
to
those
who
might
seek
it
as
it
was
more
than
noon
when
the
explorations
terminated
luc
accepted
a
proposal
to
lunch
off
eggs
and
milk
up
in
the
bleuse
mountains
when
about
two
he
came
down
again
delighted
his
lungs
inflated
by
the
free
mountain
air
the
jordans
received
him
with
exclamations
for
not
knowing
what
had
become
of
him
they
had
begun
to
grow
anxious
he
apologised
for
not
having
warned
them
and
related
that
he
had
lost
his
way
among
the
tablelands
and
had
lunched
with
some
peasants
there
he
ventured
to
tell
this
fib
because
the
jordans
whom
he
found
still
at
table
were
not
alone
as
was
their
custom
every
second
tuesday
of
the
month
they
had
with
them
three
guests
abbÃ©
marle
doctor
novarre
and
hermeline
the
schoolmaster
whom
sÅurette
delighted
to
gather
together
laughingly
calling
them
her
privy
councillors
because
they
all
three
helped
her
in
her
charitable
works
the
doors
of
la
crÃªcherie
which
were
usually
kept
closed
jordan
living
there
in
solitude
like
some
cloistered
scientist
were
thrown
open
for
those
three
visitors
who
were
treated
as
intimates
it
could
not
be
said
however
that
they
owed
this
favour
to
their
cordial
agreement
for
they
were
perpetually
disputing
together
but
on
the
other
hand
their
discussions
amused
sÅurette
and
indeed
rendered
her
yet
more
partial
to
them
since
they
proved
a
distraction
for
jordan
who
listened
to
them
smiling
you
have
lunched
said
sÅurette
addressing
luc
that
wo
prevent
you
from
taking
a
cup
of
coffee
with
us
will
it
i
accept
the
cup
of
coffee
he
answered
gaily
are
too
amiable
i
deserve
the
bitterest
reproaches
they
then
passed
into
the
its
windows
were
open
the
lawns
of
the
park
spread
out
and
all
the
exquisite
aroma
of
the
great
trees
came
into
the
house
in
a
porcelain
vase
bloomed
a
splendid
bouquet
of
roses
roses
which
doctor
novarre
lovingly
cultivated
and
a
bunch
of
which
he
brought
for
sÅurette
each
time
that
he
lunched
at
la
crÃªcherie
whilst
the
coffee
was
being
served
a
discussion
on
educational
matters
began
afresh
between
the
priest
and
the
schoolmaster
who
had
not
ceased
battling
on
this
subject
since
the
beginning
of
the
lunch
you
can
do
nothing
with
your
pupils
declared
abbÃ©
marle
is
because
you
have
driven
religion
out
of
your
schools
god
is
the
master
of
human
intelligence
one
knows
nothing
excepting
through
him
tall
and
sturdy
with
his
eagle
beak
set
in
a
broad
full
regular
face
the
priest
spoke
with
all
the
authoritative
stubbornness
born
of
his
narrow
doctrines
placing
the
only
chance
of
the
world
salvation
in
catholicism
and
the
rigid
observance
of
its
dogmas
and
in
front
of
him
hermeline
the
schoolmaster
slim
of
build
and
angular
of
face
with
a
bony
forehead
and
pointed
chin
evinced
similar
stubbornness
being
quite
as
formalist
and
authoritative
as
the
other
in
the
practice
of
his
own
mechanical
religion
of
progress
which
last
was
to
be
arrived
at
by
dint
of
laws
and
military
discipline
bother
me
said
he
your
religion
which
has
never
led
men
to
aught
but
error
and
ruin
if
i
get
nothing
out
of
my
pupils
it
is
because
in
the
first
place
they
are
taken
from
me
too
early
to
be
placed
in
the
factories
and
secondly
and
more
particularly
it
is
because
there
is
less
and
less
discipline
because
the
master
is
left
without
any
authority
if
a
child
is
whipped
nowadays
the
parents
shriek
like
a
pack
of
fools
but
if
i
were
only
allowed
to
give
those
youngsters
a
few
good
canings
i
think
i
should
open
their
minds
a
little
then
as
sÅurette
quite
affected
by
this
theory
began
to
protest
he
explained
his
views
for
him
given
the
general
corruption
there
was
only
one
means
of
saving
society
which
was
to
subject
the
children
to
the
discipline
of
liberty
insert
belief
in
republican
principles
in
them
by
force
if
necessary
and
in
such
a
manner
that
they
should
never
lose
it
his
dream
was
to
make
each
pupil
a
servant
of
the
state
a
slave
of
the
state
one
who
sacrificed
to
the
state
his
entire
personality
and
he
could
picture
nothing
beyond
one
and
the
same
lesson
learnt
by
all
in
one
and
the
same
manner
with
the
one
object
of
serving
the
community
such
was
his
harsh
and
doleful
religion
a
religion
in
which
the
democracy
was
delivered
from
the
past
by
dint
of
punishments
and
then
again
condemned
to
forced
labour
happiness
being
decreed
under
penalty
of
being
caned
but
abbÃ©
marle
obstinately
repeated
the
pale
of
catholicism
there
is
only
darkness
catholicism
is
toppling
over
exclaimed
hermeline
for
that
very
reason
that
we
have
to
raise
another
social
framework
the
priest
no
doubt
was
conscious
of
the
supreme
battle
which
catholicism
was
waging
against
the
spirit
of
science
whose
victory
spread
day
by
day
but
he
would
not
acknowledge
it
he
did
not
even
admit
that
his
church
was
gradually
emptying
he
resumed
framework
is
still
so
solid
so
eternal
so
divine
that
you
copy
it
when
you
talk
of
raising
i
know
not
what
atheistical
state
in
which
you
would
replace
the
deity
by
some
mechanical
contrivance
appointed
to
instruct
and
govern
men
mechanical
contrivance
why
not
retorted
hermeline
exasperated
by
the
touch
of
truth
contained
in
the
priest
attack
has
never
been
aught
but
a
pressing
out
the
blood
of
the
world
when
their
discussions
reached
this
violent
stage
doctor
novarre
usually
intervened
in
his
smiling
and
conciliatory
way
come
do
get
heated
said
he
are
on
the
point
of
agreeing
since
you
have
got
so
far
as
to
accuse
one
another
of
copying
your
religions
one
from
the
other
short
and
spare
with
a
slender
nose
and
keen
eyes
the
doctor
was
a
man
of
a
tolerant
gentle
but
slightly
sarcastic
turn
of
mind
one
who
having
given
himself
to
science
refused
to
let
himself
be
excited
by
political
and
social
questions
like
jordan
whose
great
friend
he
was
he
often
said
that
he
only
adopted
truths
when
they
had
been
scientifically
demonstrated
modest
timid
too
as
he
was
without
any
ambition
he
contented
himself
with
healing
his
patients
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
his
only
passion
was
for
the
rosebushes
which
he
cultivated
between
the
four
walls
of
the
garden
of
the
little
dwelling
where
he
lived
in
happy
peacefulness
luc
had
hitherto
contented
himself
with
listening
but
at
last
he
recalled
what
he
had
read
the
previous
night
and
he
then
spoke
out
terrible
part
of
it
said
he
that
in
our
schools
the
is
invariably
the
idea
that
man
is
an
evil
being
who
brings
into
the
world
with
him
a
spirit
of
rebellion
and
sloth
and
that
a
perfect
system
of
punishments
and
rewards
is
necessary
if
one
is
to
get
anything
out
of
him
thus
education
has
been
turned
into
torture
and
study
has
become
as
repulsive
to
our
brains
as
manual
labour
is
to
our
limbs
our
professors
have
been
turned
into
so
many
gaolers
ruling
a
scholastic
penitentiary
and
the
mission
given
to
them
is
that
of
kneading
the
minds
of
children
in
accordance
with
certain
fixed
programmes
and
running
them
all
through
one
and
the
same
mould
without
taking
any
account
of
varying
individualities
thus
the
masters
are
no
longer
aught
but
the
slayers
of
initiative
they
crush
all
critical
spirit
all
free
examination
all
personal
awakening
of
talent
beneath
a
pile
of
ideas
and
and
the
worst
is
that
the
characters
of
the
children
are
affected
quite
as
badly
as
their
minds
and
that
the
system
of
teaching
employed
produces
in
the
long
run
little
else
but
dolts
and
hypocrites
hermeline
must
have
fancied
that
he
was
being
personally
attacked
for
he
now
broke
in
rather
sharply
how
would
you
have
one
proceed
then
monsieur
come
and
take
my
place
and
you
will
soon
see
how
little
you
will
get
out
of
the
pupils
if
you
do
subject
them
one
and
all
to
the
same
discipline
like
a
master
who
for
them
is
the
embodiment
of
authority
master
continued
luc
with
his
dreamy
air
have
no
other
duty
than
that
of
awakening
energy
and
encouraging
the
child
aptitude
in
one
or
another
respect
by
provoking
questions
from
him
and
enabling
him
to
develop
his
personality
deep
in
the
human
race
there
is
an
immense
insatiable
craving
to
learn
and
know
and
this
should
be
the
one
incentive
to
study
without
need
of
any
rewards
or
punishments
it
would
evidently
be
sufficient
if
one
contented
oneself
with
giving
each
pupil
facilities
for
prosecuting
the
particular
studies
that
pleased
him
and
with
rendering
those
studies
attractive
to
him
allowing
him
to
engage
in
them
by
himself
then
progress
in
them
by
the
force
of
his
own
understanding
with
the
continually
recurring
delight
of
making
fresh
discoveries
for
men
to
make
their
offspring
men
by
treating
them
as
such
is
not
that
the
whole
educational
problem
which
has
to
be
solved
abbÃ©
marle
who
was
finishing
his
coffee
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
and
like
a
priest
whom
dogma
endowed
with
infallibility
he
remarked
is
in
man
and
he
can
only
be
saved
by
penitence
idleness
which
is
one
of
the
capital
sins
can
only
be
redeemed
by
labour
the
punishment
which
god
imposed
on
the
first
man
after
the
fall
that
an
error
abbÃ©
quietly
said
doctor
novarre
is
simply
a
malady
when
it
really
exists
that
is
when
the
body
refuses
to
work
shrinks
from
all
fatigue
you
may
be
certain
then
that
this
invincible
languor
is
a
sign
of
grave
internal
disorder
and
apart
from
that
where
have
you
ever
seen
idle
people
take
those
who
are
idle
people
by
race
habit
and
taste
does
not
a
society
lady
who
dances
all
night
at
a
ball
do
greater
harm
to
her
eyesight
and
expend
far
more
muscular
energy
than
a
workwoman
who
sits
at
her
little
table
embroidering
till
daylight
do
not
the
men
of
pleasure
who
are
for
ever
figuring
in
public
taking
part
in
exhausting
festivities
work
in
their
own
way
quite
as
hard
as
the
men
who
toil
at
their
benches
and
anvils
and
remember
how
lightly
and
joyfully
on
emerging
from
some
repulsive
task
we
all
rush
into
some
violent
amusement
or
exercise
which
tires
out
our
limbs
the
meaning
of
it
all
is
that
work
is
only
oppressive
when
it
does
not
please
us
and
if
one
could
succeed
in
imposing
on
people
only
such
work
as
would
be
agreeable
to
them
as
they
might
freely
choose
there
would
certainly
be
no
idlers
left
but
hermeline
in
his
turn
shrugged
his
shoulders
saying
a
child
which
he
prefers
his
grammar
or
his
arithmetic
he
will
tell
you
that
he
prefers
neither
the
whole
question
has
been
threshed
out
a
child
is
a
sapling
which
needs
to
be
trained
straight
and
corrected
one
can
only
correct
said
the
priest
this
time
in
full
agreement
with
the
schoolmaster
crushing
everything
in
any
way
shameful
or
diabolic
that
original
sin

sÅurette
had
been
listening
intently
whilst
jordan
looking
out
through
one
of
the
windows
let
his
glance
stray
thoughtfully
under
the
big
trees
in
the
words
of
the
priest
and
the
schoolmaster
luc
recognised
the
pessimist
conceptions
of
catholicism
adopted
by
the
sectarian
followers
of
progress
which
the
state
was
to
decree
by
exercise
of
authority
man
was
regarded
as
a
child
ever
in
fault
his
passions
were
hunted
down
for
centuries
efforts
had
been
made
to
crush
them
to
kill
the
man
which
was
within
man
and
then
again
luc
recalled
fourier
who
had
preached
quite
another
doctrine
the
passions
utilised
and
ennobled
becoming
necessary
creative
energies
whilst
man
was
at
last
delivered
from
the
deadly
weight
of
the
religions
of
nothingness
which
are
merely
so
many
hateful
social
police
systems
devised
to
maintain
the
usurpation
of
the
powerful
and
the
rich
and
luc
as
though
reflecting
aloud
thereupon
resumed
would
be
sufficient
to
convince
people
of
this
truth
that
the
greater
the
happiness
realised
for
all
the
greater
will
be
the
happiness
of
the
individual
but
hermeline
and
abbÃ©
marle
began
to
laugh
no
use
said
the
schoolmaster
awaken
energy
you
begin
by
destroying
personal
interest
pray
explain
to
me
what
motive
will
prompt
man
to
action
when
he
no
longer
works
for
himself
personal
interest
is
like
the
fire
under
the
boiler
it
will
be
found
at
the
outset
of
all
work
but
you
would
crush
it
and
although
you
desire
man
to
retain
all
his
instincts
you
begin
by
depriving
him
of
his
egotism
perhaps
you
rely
on
conscience
on
the
idea
of
honour
and
duty
do
need
to
rely
on
that
luc
answered
in
the
same
quiet
way
to
tell
egotism
such
as
we
have
hitherto
understood
it
has
given
us
such
a
frightful
social
system
instinct
with
so
much
hatred
and
suffering
that
it
would
really
be
allowable
to
try
some
other
factor
but
i
repeat
that
i
accept
egotism
if
by
such
you
mean
the
very
legitimate
desire
the
invincible
craving
which
each
man
has
for
happiness
far
from
destroying
personal
interest
i
would
strengthen
it
by
making
it
what
it
ought
to
be
in
order
to
bring
about
the
happy
community
in
which
the
happiness
of
each
will
be
the
outcome
of
the
happiness
of
all
besides
it
is
sufficient
that
we
should
be
convinced
that
in
working
for
others
we
are
working
for
ourselves
social
injustice
sows
eternal
hatred
and
universal
suffering
is
the
crop
for
those
reasons
an
agreement
must
be
arrived
at
for
the
reorganisation
of
work
based
upon
the
certainty
that
our
own
highest
felicity
will
some
day
be
the
result
of
felicity
in
the
homes
of
our
neighbours
hermeline
sneered
and
abbÃ©
marle
again
broke
in
love
one
another
that
is
the
teaching
of
our
divine
master
only
he
also
said
that
happiness
was
not
of
this
world
and
it
is
assuredly
guilty
madness
to
attempt
to
set
the
kingdom
of
god
upon
this
earth
when
it
is
in
heaven
that
will
some
day
be
done
luc
retorted
whole
effort
of
mankind
upon
its
march
all
progress
and
all
science
tend
to
that
future
city
of
happiness
but
the
schoolmaster
who
was
no
longer
listening
eagerly
assailed
the
priest
no
abbÃ©
do
begin
again
with
your
promises
of
a
celestial
paradise
they
are
only
fit
to
dupe
the
poor
and
besides
jesus
of
nazareth
really
belongs
to
us
you
stole
him
from
us
and
arranged
his
sayings
and
everything
else
in
order
to
suit
the
purposes
of
your
domination
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
simply
a
revolutionary
and
a
thus
the
battle
began
anew
and
doctor
novarre
had
to
calm
them
once
more
by
showing
that
one
was
right
in
certain
respects
and
the
other
in
others
as
usual
however
the
various
questions
which
had
been
debated
remained
in
suspense
for
no
final
solution
was
ever
arrived
at
the
coffee
had
been
drunk
long
since
and
it
was
jordan
who
in
his
thoughtful
manner
put
in
the
last
word
one
sole
truth
said
he
in
work
the
world
will
some
day
become
such
as
work
will
make
it
then
sÅurette
who
without
intervening
had
listened
to
luc
with
passionate
interest
spoke
of
a
refuge
which
she
thought
of
establishing
for
the
infant
children
of
factory
women
from
that
moment
the
doctor
schoolmaster
and
priest
engaged
in
quiet
and
friendly
conversation
as
to
how
this
asylum
might
best
be
organised
and
the
abuses
of
similar
establishments
avoided
and
meantime
the
shadows
of
the
great
trees
lengthened
over
the
lawns
of
the
park
and
the
flew
down
to
the
grass
in
the
golden
september
sunshine
it
was
already
four
when
the
three
guests
quitted
la
crÃªcherie
jordan
and
luc
for
the
sake
of
a
little
exercise
accompanied
them
as
far
as
the
first
houses
of
the
town
then
on
their
way
back
across
some
stony
fields
which
jordan
left
uncultivated
the
latter
suggested
that
they
should
extend
their
stroll
a
little
in
order
to
call
upon
lange
the
potter
jordan
had
allowed
him
to
instal
himself
in
a
wild
nook
of
his
estate
below
the
smeltery
asking
no
rent
or
other
payment
from
him
and
lange
like
morfain
had
made
himself
a
dwelling
in
a
rocky
cavity
which
some
of
the
old
torrents
rushing
past
the
lower
part
of
the
bleuse
mountains
had
excavated
in
the
gigantic
wall
formed
by
the
promontory
moreover
he
had
ended
by
constructing
three
kilns
near
the
slope
whence
he
took
his
clay
and
he
lived
there
without
god
or
master
amidst
all
the
free
independence
of
his
work
doubt
he
a
man
of
extreme
views
added
jordan
in
answer
to
a
question
from
luc
who
felt
greatly
interested
in
lange
you
told
me
about
his
violent
outburst
in
the
rue
de
brias
the
other
evening
did
not
surprise
me
he
was
lucky
in
getting
released
for
the
affair
might
have
turned
out
very
badly
for
him
but
you
have
no
notion
how
intelligent
he
is
and
what
art
he
puts
into
his
simple
earthen
pots
although
he
has
virtually
had
no
education
he
was
born
hereabouts
and
his
parents
were
poor
workpeople
left
an
orphan
at
ten
years
of
age
he
worked
as
a
mason
help
then
as
an
apprentice
potter
and
now
since
i
allowed
him
to
settle
on
my
land
he
is
his
own
employer
as
he
laughingly
puts
it
i
am
the
more
particularly
interested
in
some
attempts
he
is
making
with
refractory
clay
for
as
you
know
i
want
to
find
the
clay
best
suited
to
resist
the
terrible
temperature
of
my
electrical
furnaces
at
last
on
looking
up
luc
perceived
lange
among
the
bushes
faced
by
a
little
parapet
of
dry
stones
it
suggested
a
barbarian
camp
and
as
the
young
man
saw
a
tall
shapely
girl
erect
upon
the
threshold
he
inquired
lange
married
then
replied
jordan
he
lives
with
that
girl
who
is
both
his
slave
and
his
wife
it
is
quite
a
romance
five
years
ago
when
she
was
barely
fifteen
he
found
her
lying
in
a
ditch
very
ill
half
dead
in
fact
abandoned
there
by
some
band
of
gypsies
nobody
has
ever
known
exactly
where
she
came
from
she
herself
wo
answer
when
questioned
well
lange
carried
her
home
upon
his
shoulders
nursed
her
and
cured
her
and
you
ca
imagine
the
ardent
gratitude
that
she
has
always
shown
him
since
she
lacked
even
shoes
for
her
feet
when
he
found
her
even
she
seldom
puts
any
on
unless
indeed
she
is
going
down
into
the
town
in
such
wise
that
the
whole
district
and
even
lange
himself
call
her
she
is
the
only
person
that
he
employs
she
helps
him
with
his
work
and
even
in
dragging
his
barrow
when
he
goes
about
the
fairs
to
sell
his
pottery
for
that
is
his
way
of
disposing
of
his
goods
which
are
well
known
throughout
the
region
erect
on
the
threshold
of
the
little
enclosure
which
had
a
gate
of
open
fencing
barefeet
watched
the
gentlemen
approach
and
thus
luc
on
his
side
was
well
able
to
examine
her
with
her
dark
face
her
hair
black
as
ink
and
her
large
wild
eyes
which
became
full
of
ineffable
tenderness
whenever
they
turned
upon
lange
the
young
man
also
remarked
her
bare
feet
childish
feet
of
a
light
bronze
hue
resting
in
the
clayey
soil
which
was
always
damp
and
she
stood
there
in
working
costume
that
is
barely
clad
in
garments
of
grey
linen
and
showing
her
shapely
legs
and
muscular
arms
when
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
gentleman
accompanying
the
owner
of
the
estate
was
a
friend
she
quitted
her
post
of
observation
and
after
warning
lange
returned
to
the
kiln
which
she
had
previously
been
watching
it
you
monsieur
jordan
exclaimed
lange
in
his
turn
presenting
himself
you
know
that
since
that
affair
the
other
evening
barefeet
is
for
ever
imagining
that
people
are
coming
to
arrest
me
i
fancy
that
if
any
policeman
should
present
himself
here
he
would
not
escape
whole
from
her
clutches
you
have
come
to
see
my
last
refractory
bricks
eh
well
here
they
are
i
tell
you
the
composition
luc
readily
recognised
the
knotty
little
man
of
whom
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
amidst
the
gloom
of
the
rue
de
brias
whilst
he
was
announcing
the
inevitable
catastrophe
and
cursing
that
corrupt
town
of
beauclair
whose
crimes
had
condemned
it
only
as
he
now
scrutinised
him
in
detail
he
was
surprised
by
the
loftiness
of
his
brow
over
which
fell
a
dark
tangle
of
hair
and
the
keenness
of
his
eyes
which
glittered
with
intelligence
and
at
times
flared
up
with
anger
most
of
all
however
the
young
fellow
was
surprised
at
divining
beneath
a
rugged
exterior
and
apparent
violence
a
man
of
contemplative
nature
a
gentle
dreamer
a
simple
rustic
poet
who
urged
on
by
his
absolute
ideas
of
justice
had
finally
come
to
the
point
of
desiring
to
annihilate
the
old
and
guilty
world
after
introducing
luc
as
an
engineer
a
friend
of
his
jordan
asked
lange
with
a
laugh
to
show
the
young
man
what
he
called
his
museum
if
it
can
interest
the
gentleman
willingly
said
lange
are
merely
things
which
i
fire
for
amusement
sake
there
all
that
pottery
under
the
shed
you
may
give
it
all
a
glance
monsieur
while
i
explain
my
bricks
to
monsieur
jordan
luc
astonishment
increased
under
the
shed
he
found
a
number
of
faÃ¯ence
figures
vases
pots
and
dishes
of
the
strangest
shapes
and
colours
which
whilst
denoting
great
ignorance
on
the
maker
part
were
yet
delightful
in
their
original
the
firings
had
at
times
yielded
some
superb
results
much
of
the
enamel
displayed
a
wondrous
richness
of
tone
but
what
particularly
struck
the
young
man
among
the
current
pottery
which
lange
prepared
for
his
usual
customers
at
the
markets
and
fairs
the
crockery
the
the
pitchers
and
basins
was
the
elegance
of
shape
and
charm
of
colour
which
showed
forth
like
some
florescence
of
the
popular
genius
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
potter
had
derived
his
talent
from
his
race
that
those
creations
of
his
instinct
with
the
soul
of
the
masses
sprang
naturally
from
his
big
fingers
as
though
in
fact
he
had
intuitively
rediscovered
the
primitive
models
so
full
of
practical
beauty
when
lange
came
back
with
jordan
who
had
ordered
of
him
a
few
hundred
bricks
with
which
it
was
intended
to
try
a
new
electrical
furnace
he
received
with
a
smile
the
congratulations
tendered
him
by
luc
who
marvelled
at
the
gaiety
of
the
faÃ¯ences
which
looked
so
bright
so
flowery
with
purple
and
azure
in
the
broad
sunlight
yes
said
the
potter
set
a
few
poppies
and
cornflowers
as
it
were
in
people
houses
i
always
thought
that
roofs
and
ought
to
be
decorated
in
that
style
it
would
not
cost
very
much
if
the
tradesmen
would
only
leave
off
thieving
and
see
too
how
pleasant
a
town
would
look
quite
like
a
nosegay
set
in
greenery
but
there
nothing
to
be
done
with
the
dirty
of
nowadays
then
he
at
once
lapsed
into
his
sectarian
passion
plunged
into
the
ideas
of
anarchy
which
he
had
derived
from
a
few
pamphlets
that
by
some
chance
had
fallen
into
his
hands
first
of
all
one
had
to
destroy
everything
seize
everything
in
revolutionary
style
salvation
would
only
be
obtained
by
the
annihilation
of
all
authority
for
if
any
even
the
most
insignificant
remained
standing
it
would
suffice
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
whole
edifice
of
iniquity
and
tyranny
next
the
free
commune
without
any
government
whatever
might
be
established
by
means
of
agreement
between
different
groups
which
would
incessantly
be
varied
and
modified
according
to
the
desires
and
needs
of
each
luc
was
struck
at
finding
in
this
theory
much
that
had
been
devised
by
fourier
and
indeed
the
ultimate
dream
was
the
same
even
if
the
roads
to
be
followed
were
different
thus
the
anarchist
was
but
a
fourierist
a
disabused
and
exasperated
collectivist
who
no
longer
believed
in
political
means
but
was
resolved
to
use
force
and
extermination
as
his
instrument
to
reach
social
happiness
since
centuries
of
slow
evolution
seemed
unlikely
to
achieve
it
and
thus
when
luc
mentioned
bonnaire
lange
became
quite
ferocious
in
his
irony
showing
more
bitter
disdain
for
the
than
he
would
have
shown
for
a
ah
yes
indeed
bonnaire
barracks
that
famous
collectivism
in
which
one
would
be
numbered
disciplined
imprisoned
as
in
a
penitentiary
and
stretching
out
his
fist
towards
beauclair
whose
roofs
he
overlooked
the
potter
once
more
poured
his
lamentation
his
prophetic
curse
upon
that
corrupt
town
which
fire
would
destroy
and
which
would
be
razed
to
the
very
ground
in
order
that
the
city
of
truth
and
justice
might
at
last
rise
from
its
ashes
astonished
by
this
violence
jordan
looked
at
him
curiously
saying
lange
my
good
fellow
you
are
not
so
badly
off
monsieur
jordan
i
very
happy
as
happy
as
one
can
be
i
live
in
freedom
here
and
it
almost
the
realisation
of
anarchy
you
have
let
me
take
this
little
bit
of
earth
the
earth
which
belongs
to
us
all
and
i
my
own
master
i
pay
rent
to
nobody
then
too
i
work
as
i
fancy
i
no
employer
to
crush
me
and
no
workman
for
me
to
crush
i
myself
sell
my
pots
and
pitchers
to
good
folk
who
need
them
without
being
robbed
by
tradesmen
or
allowing
them
to
rob
customers
and
when
i
so
inclined
i
still
time
to
amuse
myself
by
firing
those
faÃ¯ence
figures
and
ornamental
pots
and
plates
whose
bright
colours
please
my
eyes
ah
no
indeed
we
do
complain
we
feel
happy
in
living
when
the
sun
comes
to
cheer
us
is
that
so
barefeet
the
girl
had
drawn
near
with
her
hands
quite
pink
from
removing
a
pot
from
the
wheel
and
she
smiled
divinely
as
she
looked
at
the
man
the
god
whose
servant
she
had
made
herself
and
to
whom
she
wholly
belonged
all
the
same
resumed
lange
are
too
many
poor
devils
suffering
and
so
we
shall
have
to
blow
up
beauclair
one
of
these
fine
mornings
in
order
that
it
may
be
built
again
properly
propaganda
by
deeds
is
the
only
thing
that
is
of
any
good
only
bombs
can
rouse
the
people
and
do
you
know
that
i
everything
here
that
necessary
to
prepare
two
or
three
dozen
bombs
which
would
prove
wonderfully
powerful
some
fine
day
perhaps
i
shall
start
off
with
the
barrow
which
i
pull
in
front
you
know
while
barefeet
pushes
it
behind
fairly
heavy
when
it
is
laden
with
pottery
and
one
has
to
drag
it
along
the
bad
village
roads
from
market
to
market
so
we
take
a
rest
now
and
again
under
the
trees
at
spots
where
there
are
springs
handy
only
that
day
we
quit
beauclair
we
shall
go
along
all
the
streets
and
there
be
a
bomb
hidden
in
each
we
shall
deposit
one
at
the
another
at
the
another
at
the
law
courts
then
another
at
the
church
at
all
the
places
in
fact
where
there
anything
in
the
shape
of
authority
to
be
destroyed
the
matches
will
burn
each
will
last
the
necessary
time
then
all
at
once
beauclair
will
go
up
a
frightful
eruption
will
burn
it
and
carry
it
away
eh
what
do
you
think
of
that
of
my
little
promenade
with
my
barrow
and
my
little
distribution
of
the
i
making
to
bring
about
the
happiness
of
mankind
he
laughed
a
laugh
of
ecstasy
his
face
all
aglow
with
excitement
and
as
the
beautiful
dark
girl
began
to
laugh
with
him
he
turned
and
said
to
her
that
so
barefeet
i
pull
and
you
shall
push
and
it
will
be
even
a
finer
walk
than
the
one
we
take
under
the
willows
alongside
the
mionne
when
we
go
to
the
fair
at
magnolles
jordan
did
not
argue
the
point
but
made
a
gesture
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
as
a
scientist
regarded
such
a
conception
as
imbecility
but
when
they
had
taken
leave
and
were
returning
to
la
crÃªcherie
luc
quivered
at
the
thought
of
that
black
poem
that
dream
of
ensuring
happiness
by
destruction
which
thus
haunted
the
minds
of
a
few
primitive
poets
among
the
disinherited
classes
and
thus
each
deep
in
his
own
meditations
the
two
men
went
homeward
in
silence
on
repairing
direct
to
the
laboratory
they
there
found
sÅurette
quietly
seated
at
a
little
table
where
she
was
making
a
clean
copy
of
one
of
her
brother
manuscripts
she
just
raised
her
head
and
smiled
at
him
and
his
companion
then
turned
to
her
task
once
more
said
jordan
throwing
himself
back
in
an
is
quite
certain
that
my
only
good
time
is
that
which
i
spend
here
among
my
appliances
and
papers
as
soon
as
i
come
back
to
this
laboratory
hope
and
peace
seem
to
rise
to
my
heart
once
more
he
glanced
affectionately
around
the
spacious
room
whose
large
windows
were
open
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
entering
warmly
and
caressingly
whilst
between
the
trees
one
saw
the
roofs
and
casements
of
beauclair
shining
in
the
distance
wretched
and
futile
all
those
disputes
are
jordan
resumed
whilst
luc
softly
paced
up
and
down
i
listened
to
the
priest
and
the
schoolmaster
after
lunch
i
felt
astonished
that
people
could
lose
their
time
in
striving
to
convince
one
another
when
they
viewed
questions
from
opposite
standpoints
and
could
not
even
speak
the
same
language
please
observe
that
they
never
come
here
without
beginning
precisely
the
same
discussions
afresh
and
reaching
absolutely
the
same
point
as
on
the
previous
occasion
and
besides
how
silly
it
is
to
confine
oneself
to
the
absolute
to
take
no
account
of
experience
and
to
fight
on
simply
with
contradictory
arguments
i
am
entirely
of
the
opinion
of
the
doctor
who
amuses
himself
with
annihilating
both
priest
and
schoolmaster
by
merely
opposing
one
to
the
other
and
then
as
regards
that
fellow
lange
can
one
imagine
a
man
dreaming
of
more
ridiculous
things
losing
himself
in
more
manifest
dangerous
errors
all
through
bestirring
himself
chancewise
and
disdaining
certainties
no
decidedly
political
passions
do
not
suit
me
the
things
which
those
people
say
to
one
another
seem
to
me
devoid
of
sense
and
the
biggest
questions
which
they
broach
are
in
my
eyes
mere
pastimes
for
amusement
on
the
road
i
can
not
understand
why
such
vain
battles
should
be
fought
over
petty
incidents
when
the
discovery
of
the
smallest
scientific
truth
does
more
for
progress
than
fifty
years
of
social
struggling
luc
began
to
laugh
are
falling
into
the
absolute
yourself
said
he
ought
to
struggle
politics
simply
represent
the
necessity
in
which
he
finds
himself
to
defend
his
needs
and
ensure
himself
the
greatest
sum
of
happiness
possible
are
right
acknowledged
jordan
with
his
simple
good
faith
my
disdain
for
politics
merely
comes
from
some
covert
remorse
some
desire
to
live
in
ignorance
of
the
country
political
affairs
in
order
to
avoid
being
disturbed
by
them
but
sincerely
now
i
think
that
i
am
still
a
good
citizen
in
shutting
myself
up
in
my
laboratory
for
each
serves
the
nation
according
to
his
lights
and
assuredly
the
real
revolutionaries
the
real
men
of
action
those
who
do
the
most
to
ensure
the
advent
of
truth
and
justice
in
the
future
are
the
scientists
a
government
passes
and
falls
a
people
grows
triumphs
and
then
declines
but
the
truths
of
science
are
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
ever
spreading
ever
giving
increase
of
light
and
certainty
a
pause
of
a
century
does
not
count
the
forward
march
is
always
resumed
at
last
and
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
mankind
goes
on
towards
knowledge
the
objection
that
one
will
never
know
everything
is
ridiculous
the
question
is
to
learn
as
much
as
we
can
in
order
that
we
may
attain
to
the
greatest
happiness
possible
and
so
i
repeat
it
how
unimportant
are
those
political
jolts
on
the
road
in
which
nations
take
such
passionate
interest
whilst
people
set
the
salvation
of
progress
in
the
maintenance
or
fall
of
a
ministry
it
is
really
the
scientist
who
determines
what
the
morrow
shall
be
by
illumining
the
darkness
of
the
multitude
with
a
fresh
spark
of
truth
all
injustice
will
cease
when
all
truth
has
been
acquired
silence
fell
sÅurette
who
had
put
down
her
pen
was
now
listening
after
pondering
for
a
few
moments
jordan
without
transition
resumed
ah
work
i
owe
my
life
to
it
you
see
what
a
poor
puny
little
being
i
am
i
remember
that
my
mother
used
to
wrap
me
in
thick
rugs
whenever
the
wind
was
at
all
violent
yet
it
was
she
who
set
me
to
work
as
to
a
which
was
certain
to
bring
good
health
she
did
not
condemn
me
to
crushing
studies
forms
of
punishment
with
which
growing
minds
are
so
often
tortured
but
she
instilled
into
me
a
habit
of
regular
varied
and
attractive
work
and
it
was
thus
that
i
learnt
to
work
as
one
learns
to
breathe
and
to
walk
work
has
become
like
the
function
of
my
being
the
necessary
natural
play
of
my
limbs
and
organs
the
object
of
my
life
and
the
very
means
that
enables
me
to
live
i
have
lived
because
i
have
worked
some
sort
of
equilibrium
has
been
arrived
at
between
the
world
and
me
i
have
given
it
back
in
work
what
it
has
brought
me
in
the
form
of
sensations
and
i
believe
that
all
health
lies
therein
that
is
in
exchanges
a
perfect
adaptation
of
the
organism
to
its
surroundings
and
however
slight
of
build
i
may
be
i
shall
live
to
a
good
old
age
that
certain
since
like
a
little
machine
i
have
been
carefully
put
together
and
wound
up
and
work
logically
luc
had
paused
in
his
slow
perambulation
like
sÅurette
he
was
now
listening
with
passionate
interest
that
is
only
a
question
of
the
life
of
beings
of
the
necessity
of
good
hygiene
if
one
is
to
have
good
life
continued
jordan
is
life
itself
life
is
the
continual
work
of
chemical
and
mechanical
forces
since
the
first
atom
stirred
to
join
the
atoms
near
it
the
great
creative
work
has
never
ceased
and
this
creative
work
which
continues
and
will
always
continue
is
like
the
very
task
of
eternity
the
universal
task
to
which
we
all
contribute
our
store
is
not
the
universe
an
immense
workshop
where
there
is
never
an
day
where
matter
from
the
simplest
ferments
to
the
most
perfect
creatures
acts
makes
brings
forth
unceasingly
the
fields
which
become
covered
with
crops
work
the
slowly
growing
forests
work
the
rivers
streaming
through
the
valleys
work
the
seas
rolling
their
waves
from
one
to
another
continent
work
the
worlds
carried
by
the
rhythm
of
gravitation
through
the
infinite
work
there
is
not
a
being
not
a
thing
that
can
remain
still
in
idleness
all
find
themselves
carried
along
set
to
work
forced
to
contribute
to
the
common
task
who
or
whatever
does
not
work
disappears
from
that
very
cause
is
thrust
aside
as
something
useless
and
cumbersome
and
has
to
yield
place
to
the
necessary
indispensable
worker
such
is
the
one
law
of
life
which
upon
the
whole
is
simply
matter
working
a
force
in
perpetual
activity
tending
towards
that
final
work
of
happiness
an
imperious
craving
for
which
we
all
have
within
us
for
another
moment
jordan
reflected
his
eyes
wandering
far
away
then
he
resumed
what
an
admirable
regulator
is
work
what
orderliness
it
brings
with
it
whomever
it
reigns
it
is
peace
it
is
joy
even
as
it
is
health
i
am
confounded
when
i
see
it
disdained
vilified
regarded
as
chastisement
and
shame
whilst
saving
me
from
certain
death
it
also
gave
me
all
that
is
good
in
me
and
what
an
admirable
organiser
it
is
how
well
it
regulates
the
faculties
of
the
mind
the
play
of
the
muscles
the
rÃ´le
of
each
group
in
a
collectivity
of
workers
it
would
of
itself
suffice
as
a
political
constitution
a
human
police
a
social
we
are
born
solely
for
the
sake
of
the
hive
we
none
of
us
bring
into
the
world
more
than
our
individual
momentary
effort
all
other
explanations
would
be
vain
and
false
our
individual
lives
appear
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
universal
life
of
future
worlds
no
happiness
is
possible
unless
we
set
it
in
the
solidary
happiness
of
eternal
and
general
toil
and
this
is
why
i
should
like
to
see
the
foundation
of
the
religion
of
work
a
hosannah
to
work
which
saves
work
in
which
is
to
be
found
the
one
truth
and
sovereign
health
joy
and
peace
he
ceased
speaking
and
sÅurette
raised
a
cry
of
loving
enthusiasm
right
you
are
brother
and
how
true
how
beautiful
it
is
but
luc
seemed
more
moved
even
than
she
he
had
remained
standing
there
motionless
his
eyes
gradually
filling
with
light
as
if
he
were
some
apostle
illumined
by
a
suddenly
descending
ray
and
all
at
once
he
spoke
jordan
you
must
not
sell
your
property
to
delaveau
you
must
keep
everything
both
the
and
the
mine
my
answer
i
give
it
you
now
because
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
upon
the
subject
surprised
by
those
words
the
connection
of
which
with
what
he
had
just
said
escaped
him
the
master
of
la
crÃªcherie
started
slightly
and
blinked
so
my
dear
luc
he
asked
do
you
say
that
explain
yourself
the
young
man
however
remained
silent
for
a
moment
overcome
as
he
was
by
emotion
that
hymn
that
glorification
of
pacifying
and
reorganising
work
had
suddenly
raised
him
carried
him
away
in
spirit
at
last
showing
him
the
great
horizon
which
hitherto
had
been
clouded
in
mist
to
his
eyes
everything
now
acquired
precision
grew
animated
assumed
absolute
certainty
faith
also
glowed
within
him
and
his
words
came
from
his
lips
with
extraordinary
power
of
persuasion
must
not
sell
the
property
to
delaveau
he
repeated
visited
the
abandoned
mine
such
as
the
ore
is
in
the
present
veins
one
can
still
derive
good
profit
from
it
by
subjecting
it
to
the
new
chemical
processes
and
morfain
has
convinced
me
that
one
will
find
excellent
lodes
on
the
other
side
of
the
gorge
there
is
incalculable
wealth
there
the
will
yield
cast
iron
cheaply
and
if
it
be
completed
by
a
forge
some
puddling
furnaces
rolling
mills
steam
hammers
and
so
forth
one
may
again
begin
making
rails
and
girders
in
such
a
way
as
to
compete
victoriously
with
the
most
prosperous
of
the
north
and
the
east
jordan
surprise
was
increasing
becoming
sheer
consternation
i
do
want
to
get
any
richer
he
protested
too
much
money
already
and
if
i
desire
to
sell
the
place
it
is
precisely
in
order
to
escape
from
all
the
cares
of
gain
with
a
fine
passionate
gesture
luc
broke
in
me
finish
my
friend
it
is
you
that
i
desire
to
enrich
it
is
the
disinherited
ones
the
workers
whom
we
were
speaking
of
just
now
the
victims
of
iniquitous
and
vilified
labour
as
you
have
said
work
ought
of
itself
alone
to
be
a
social
at
the
moment
i
heard
you
the
path
to
salvation
became
manifest
to
me
the
happy
community
of
can
only
be
brought
about
by
such
a
reorganisation
of
work
as
will
lead
to
an
equitable
apportionment
of
wealth
the
only
solution
by
which
our
misery
and
sufferings
may
be
dispelled
lies
in
that
if
the
old
social
fabric
now
cracking
and
rotting
is
to
be
replaced
by
another
it
must
be
upon
the
basis
of
work
shared
by
all
and
benefiting
all
accepted
indeed
as
the
universal
law
well
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
attempt
here
a
reorganisation
of
work
on
a
small
scale
a
brotherly
enterprise
a
rough
draft
as
it
were
of
the
social
system
of
which
i
should
contrast
with
the
other
enterprises
those
based
upon
the
wage
system
the
ancient
prisons
where
workmen
are
regarded
as
slaves
and
tortured
and
dishonoured
he
went
on
speaking
in
quivering
accents
outlining
his
dream
all
that
had
germinated
in
his
mind
since
his
recent
perusal
of
theories
there
ought
to
be
an
association
between
capital
work
and
talent
jordan
would
provide
the
money
required
bonnaire
and
his
mates
would
give
their
arms
and
his
luc
would
be
the
brain
that
plans
and
directs
whilst
speaking
the
young
man
again
began
to
walk
up
and
down
pointing
vehemently
the
while
towards
the
neighbouring
roofs
of
beauclair
it
was
beauclair
that
he
would
save
extricate
from
the
shame
and
crime
in
which
he
had
seen
it
sinking
for
three
days
past
as
he
gradually
unfolded
his
plan
of
action
he
marvelled
at
himself
for
he
had
not
thought
that
he
had
all
this
in
him
but
he
at
last
saw
things
clearly
he
had
found
his
road
and
he
now
replied
to
all
the
distressing
questions
which
he
had
put
to
himself
during
his
insomnia
without
then
finding
any
answer
to
them
in
particular
he
now
responded
to
those
appeals
from
the
wretched
which
had
come
to
him
from
out
of
the
darkness
at
present
he
distinctly
heard
those
cries
and
he
went
forward
to
succour
the
poor
beings
who
raised
them
he
would
save
them
by
regenerated
work
by
work
which
would
no
longer
divide
men
into
inimical
castes
but
would
unite
them
in
one
sole
brotherly
family
wherein
the
efforts
of
each
would
be
directed
to
obtaining
the
happiness
of
all
the
application
of
fourier
formula
said
jordan
not
destroy
the
even
among
the
collectivists
little
of
that
system
is
changed
excepting
the
name
to
annihilate
it
one
would
have
to
go
as
far
as
anarchy
luc
was
obliged
to
admit
the
truth
of
this
objection
and
in
doing
so
he
passed
his
feelings
and
opinions
in
review
the
theories
of
bonnaire
the
collectivist
and
the
dreams
of
lange
the
anarchist
still
lingered
in
his
ears
the
discussions
between
abbÃ©
marle
schoolmaster
hermeline
and
doctor
novarre
also
seemed
to
begin
afresh
and
continue
endlessly
the
whole
made
up
a
chaos
of
contrary
opinions
particularly
as
luc
likewise
recalled
the
objections
exchanged
by
the
precursors
of
socialism
auguste
comte
and
proudhon
why
was
it
then
that
amongst
so
many
formulas
he
himself
should
choose
those
of
fourier
no
doubt
he
was
acquainted
with
a
few
fortunate
applications
of
them
but
he
also
knew
how
slowly
attempts
progressed
and
what
difficulties
stood
in
the
way
of
any
decisive
result
perhaps
his
choice
was
due
to
the
fact
that
revolutionary
violence
was
quite
repugnant
to
him
personally
since
he
had
set
his
scientific
faith
in
ceaseless
evolution
which
has
all
eternity
before
it
to
achieve
its
ends
moreover
a
complete
and
sudden
expropriation
of
possessors
could
not
be
effected
without
terrible
catastrophes
which
would
increase
the
present
sum
of
misery
and
sorrow
would
it
not
be
best
therefore
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
of
such
a
practical
experiment
as
lay
before
him
an
attempt
in
which
he
would
find
contentment
for
his
whole
being
his
own
native
goodness
of
heart
and
his
faith
in
man
goodness
also
he
was
upbuoyed
by
some
exalted
heroic
feeling
a
faith
a
kind
of
prescience
which
seemed
to
make
success
a
certainty
and
besides
even
if
the
application
of
formulas
should
not
bring
about
the
immediate
end
of
the
it
would
at
least
be
a
forward
step
it
would
tend
towards
the
final
victory
the
destruction
of
capital
the
disappearance
of
mere
traders
commercial
and
the
annihilation
of
the
power
of
money
that
source
of
all
evils
whose
uselessness
would
be
proved
the
great
quarrel
of
the
socialist
schools
is
one
as
to
the
means
which
should
be
employed
the
schools
are
all
agreed
as
to
the
object
in
view
and
they
will
all
be
reconciled
when
some
day
the
happy
community
is
at
last
established
it
was
the
first
foundations
of
that
community
which
luc
desired
to
lay
by
collecting
scattered
forces
associating
men
of
good
will
together
and
he
was
convinced
that
given
the
frightful
massacre
now
going
on
there
could
be
no
better
point
of
departure
jordan
remained
sceptical
however
had
flashes
of
genius
said
he
is
certain
only
he
has
now
been
dead
more
than
sixty
years
and
if
he
still
retains
a
few
stubborn
disciples
i
see
no
sign
of
his
religion
conquering
the
world
took
four
centuries
to
conquer
a
small
part
of
it
luc
quickly
retorted
i
do
adopt
the
whole
of
fourier
views
i
regard
him
simply
as
a
wise
man
to
whom
one
day
a
vision
of
the
truth
appeared
moreover
he
is
not
the
only
one
others
helped
to
prepare
the
formula
and
others
will
perfect
it
one
thing
which
you
can
not
deny
is
that
the
evolution
now
proceeding
so
rapidly
dates
from
far
back
the
whole
of
our
century
has
been
given
to
the
laborious
engendering
of
the
new
social
system
which
will
arise
each
day
for
a
hundred
years
past
the
workers
have
been
born
a
little
more
to
social
life
and
they
will
be
masters
of
their
destinies
by
virtue
of
that
scientific
law
which
ensures
life
to
the
strongest
healthiest
and
worthiest
it
is
all
that
which
we
nowadays
behold
the
final
struggle
between
the
privileged
few
by
whom
wealth
has
been
stolen
and
the
great
toiling
masses
who
wish
to
recover
the
possession
of
wealth
of
which
they
have
been
despoiled
for
long
centuries
history
teaches
us
how
a
few
seized
on
the
greatest
happiness
possible
to
the
detriment
of
all
the
others
and
how
since
then
all
the
wretched
despoiled
ones
have
never
ceased
to
struggle
furiously
eager
to
reconquer
as
much
happiness
as
they
could
for
the
last
fifty
years
the
contest
has
become
merciless
and
one
now
sees
the
privileged
folk
seized
with
fear
and
slowly
relinquishing
of
their
own
accord
certain
of
their
privileges
the
times
are
approaching
one
can
feel
it
by
all
the
concessions
which
the
holders
of
land
and
wealth
make
to
the
people
in
the
political
sphere
much
has
been
given
it
already
and
it
will
also
be
necessary
to
give
it
much
in
the
economic
sphere
one
sees
nothing
but
new
laws
favouring
the
workers
humanitarian
measures
of
all
kinds
the
triumphs
too
of
associations
and
unions
and
all
announce
the
coming
era
the
battle
between
labour
and
capital
has
reached
such
an
acute
crisis
that
one
can
already
predict
the
defeat
of
the
latter
in
time
the
disappearance
of
the
is
certain
and
this
is
why
i
feel
convinced
that
i
shall
conquer
by
helping
on
the
advent
of
that
something
else
which
will
replace
the
that
reorganisation
of
work
which
will
give
us
more
justice
and
a
loftier
civilisation
he
was
radiant
with
benevolence
faith
and
hope
and
continuing
he
went
back
to
history
to
the
robberies
perpetrated
by
the
stronger
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
world
the
wretched
multitude
being
reduced
to
slavery
and
the
possessors
piling
crime
upon
crime
in
order
that
they
might
not
be
obliged
to
restore
anything
to
those
who
were
despoiled
and
who
perished
by
starvation
or
violence
and
he
showed
the
accumulation
of
wealth
increased
by
time
and
still
now
in
the
hands
of
a
few
who
held
the
country
estates
the
houses
in
the
towns
the
factories
of
the
industrial
centres
the
mines
where
coal
and
metal
slumber
the
means
of
transport
by
road
canal
and
rail
and
then
the
rentes
the
gold
and
the
silver
the
millions
which
circulate
through
the
banks
briefly
the
whole
wealth
of
earth
all
that
constitutes
the
incalculable
fortune
of
mankind
and
was
it
not
abominable
that
so
much
wealth
should
only
lead
to
the
frightful
indigence
of
the
greater
number
did
not
such
a
state
of
things
demand
justice
could
one
not
see
the
inevitable
necessity
of
proceeding
to
a
fresh
apportionment
of
wealth
such
iniquity
in
which
on
the
one
hand
one
beheld
idleness
gorged
with
possession
and
on
the
other
labour
agonising
in
misery
had
made
man
wolfish
towards
man
instead
of
uniting
to
conquer
and
domesticate
the
forces
of
nature
men
wolfishly
devoured
one
another
their
barbarous
social
system
cast
them
to
hatred
and
error
and
madness
infants
and
aged
beings
were
abandoned
and
woman
was
crushed
down
to
become
a
beast
of
burden
for
some
and
a
mere
instrument
of
pleasure
for
others
the
workers
themselves
corrupted
by
example
accepted
their
servitude
bending
their
heads
amidst
the
universal
cowardice
and
how
frightful
too
was
the
waste
of
human
fortune
the
colossal
sums
spent
on
warfare
and
all
the
money
given
to
useless
functionaries
to
judges
and
to
gendarmes
and
then
there
was
all
the
money
winch
without
necessity
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
traders
those
parasite
intermediaries
whose
gains
were
levied
on
the
consumers
but
after
all
this
was
only
the
daily
loss
of
an
illogical
badly
constructed
social
system
apart
from
it
there
was
downright
crime
famine
deliberately
organised
by
those
who
detained
the
instruments
of
labour
in
order
to
protect
their
profits
they
reduced
the
output
of
a
factory
they
imposed
upon
miners
they
created
misery
for
purposes
of
economic
warfare
in
order
to
keep
up
high
prices
and
yet
people
were
astonished
that
the
machine
should
be
cracking
and
collapsing
beneath
such
a
pile
of
suffering
injustice
and
shame
no
cried
luc
can
not
last
unless
mankind
is
to
disappear
in
a
final
attack
of
madness
the
social
compact
must
be
changed
each
man
that
is
born
has
a
right
to
life
and
the
earth
is
the
common
fortune
of
us
all
the
instruments
of
work
must
be
restored
to
all
each
must
do
his
own
share
of
the
general
labour
if
history
with
its
hatreds
its
wars
its
crimes
has
hitherto
been
nothing
but
the
abominable
outcome
of
original
theft
of
the
tyranny
of
a
few
thieves
who
had
to
urge
men
on
to
murder
one
another
and
institute
law
courts
and
prisons
to
defend
their
deeds
of
rapine
it
is
time
to
begin
history
afresh
and
to
set
at
the
dawn
of
the
new
era
a
great
act
of
equity
the
restoration
of
the
wealth
of
the
earth
to
all
men
work
once
again
becoming
the
universal
law
of
human
society
even
as
it
is
that
of
the
universe
in
order
that
peace
may
be
made
among
us
and
happy
brotherliness
at
last
prevail
and
that
shall
be
i
will
work
for
it
and
i
will
succeed
he
seemed
so
passionate
so
lofty
so
victorious
in
his
prophetic
exaltation
that
jordan
marvelling
turned
towards
sÅurette
to
say
look
at
him
is
he
not
handsome
sÅurette
herself
quivering
pale
with
admiration
had
not
taken
her
eyes
from
luc
it
seemed
as
if
a
kind
of
religious
fervour
possessed
her
he
is
handsome
she
murmured
faintly
he
is
good
as
well
my
dear
friend
resumed
jordan
smiling
are
really
an
anarchist
however
much
you
may
deem
yourself
to
be
an
evolutionist
but
you
are
right
in
holding
that
one
begins
by
fourier
formula
and
ends
by
the
free
man
in
the
free
commune
luc
himself
had
begun
to
laugh
all
events
said
he
make
a
start
we
shall
see
whither
logic
will
lead
us
jordan
had
become
thoughtful
however
and
no
longer
seemed
to
hear
him
he
the
cloistered
scientist
had
been
profoundly
stirred
and
if
he
still
doubted
the
possibility
of
hastening
mankind
advance
he
no
longer
denied
the
utility
of
experiment
initiative
is
no
doubt
in
some
respects
he
said
determine
facts
one
simply
needs
a
man
of
will
and
action
some
rebel
of
genius
and
free
mind
who
brings
the
new
truth
with
him
in
cases
of
accident
when
salvation
depends
on
cutting
a
cable
or
splitting
a
beam
only
a
man
and
a
hatchet
are
necessary
will
is
everything
the
saviour
is
he
who
wields
the
hatchet
nothing
resists
mountains
collapse
and
seas
retire
before
an
individuality
that
acts
was
that
indeed
in
those
words
luc
found
an
expression
of
the
will
and
conviction
glowing
within
him
he
knew
not
yet
what
genius
he
brought
with
him
but
he
was
pervaded
by
a
strength
that
seemed
to
have
been
long
accumulating
a
strength
compounded
of
revolt
against
all
the
injustice
of
centuries
and
an
ardent
craving
to
bring
justice
into
the
world
at
last
his
also
was
the
freed
mind
he
only
accepted
such
facts
as
were
scientifically
proved
he
was
alone
too
he
wished
to
act
alone
he
set
all
his
faith
in
action
he
was
the
man
who
dares
and
that
would
be
sufficient
his
mission
would
be
fulfilled
silence
reigned
for
a
moment
and
then
jordan
with
a
friendly
gesture
of
surrender
said
i
have
already
told
you
there
are
hours
of
lassitude
when
i
would
give
delaveau
the
whole
property
both
the
smeltery
and
the
mine
and
the
land
so
as
to
rid
myself
of
them
and
to
be
able
to
devote
myself
in
peace
to
my
studies
and
experiments
so
take
them
you
i
prefer
to
give
them
to
you
since
you
think
you
can
turn
them
to
good
use
all
that
i
ask
of
you
is
to
deliver
me
completely
from
the
burden
to
leave
me
in
my
corner
to
work
and
finish
my
task
without
ever
speaking
to
me
of
these
affairs
again
luc
gazed
at
him
with
sparkling
eyes
in
which
all
his
gratitude
all
his
affection
glittered
then
without
any
hesitation
like
one
certain
of
the
reply
he
would
receive
he
said
is
not
all
my
friend
your
great
heart
must
do
something
more
i
can
undertake
nothing
without
money
i
need
five
hundred
thousand
francs
to
establish
the
works
i
dream
of
which
will
be
like
the
foundation
of
the
future
city
i
am
convinced
that
i
offer
you
a
good
investment
since
your
capital
will
enter
into
the
association
and
ensure
you
a
large
part
of
the
profits
and
as
jordan
wished
to
interpose
he
went
on
i
know
that
you
do
not
desire
to
become
any
richer
nevertheless
you
must
live
and
if
you
give
me
your
money
i
shall
strive
to
provide
for
all
your
material
wants
in
such
a
manner
that
your
peace
as
a
worker
shall
never
be
disturbed
once
more
did
silence
grave
full
of
emotion
fall
in
that
spacious
room
where
so
much
work
was
already
germinating
for
the
harvests
of
the
days
to
come
the
decision
that
had
to
be
taken
was
fraught
with
such
great
importance
for
the
future
that
it
set
something
like
a
religious
quiver
there
during
that
august
interval
of
suspense
is
a
soul
of
renunciation
and
benevolence
said
luc
again
you
not
apprise
me
of
it
yesterday
when
you
told
me
that
you
would
not
trade
upon
the
discoveries
you
pursue
those
electrical
furnaces
which
will
some
day
reduce
human
labour
and
enrich
mankind
with
new
wealth
for
my
part
it
is
not
a
gift
that
i
ask
of
you
it
is
brotherly
help
help
to
enable
me
to
lessen
the
injustice
of
the
times
and
create
some
happiness
in
the
world
then
in
very
simple
fashion
jordan
consented
willing
my
friend
he
said
shall
have
the
money
to
realise
your
dream
only
as
one
never
ought
to
tell
a
falsehood
i
will
add
that
in
my
eyes
that
dream
is
still
only
so
much
generous
utopia
for
you
have
not
fully
convinced
me
excuse
the
doubts
of
a
scientist
but
no
matter
you
are
a
good
fellow
make
your
attempt
i
will
be
with
you
luc
whom
enthusiasm
seemed
to
raise
from
the
ground
gave
a
cry
of
triumph
i
tell
you
that
the
work
is
as
good
as
done
and
that
we
shall
know
the
divine
joy
of
having
accomplished
it
sÅurette
hitherto
had
not
intervened
she
had
not
even
stirred
but
all
the
kindliness
of
her
heart
had
made
itself
manifest
in
her
face
big
tears
of
tender
emotion
filled
her
eyes
all
at
once
under
some
irresistible
impulse
she
rose
drew
near
to
luc
silent
distracted
and
kissed
him
on
the
face
her
tears
gushing
forth
as
she
did
so
then
in
her
wondrous
emotion
she
flung
herself
into
her
arms
and
long
remained
sobbing
there
slightly
surprised
by
the
kiss
she
had
given
the
young
man
jordan
anxiously
inquired
is
the
matter
little
sister
at
least
you
do
disapprove
of
what
is
proposed
do
you
it
is
true
that
we
ought
to
have
consulted
you
but
there
is
still
time
are
you
with
us
yes
oh
yes
she
stammered
smiling
suddenly
radiant
amidst
her
tears
are
two
heroes
and
i
will
serve
you
dispose
of
me
late
on
the
evening
of
that
same
day
towards
eleven
luc
leant
out
of
the
window
of
the
little
pavilion
as
on
the
previous
night
in
order
to
inhale
for
a
moment
the
calm
fresh
air
in
front
of
him
beyond
the
uncultivated
fields
strewn
with
rocks
beauclair
was
falling
asleep
extinguishing
its
lights
one
by
one
whilst
on
the
left
the
abyss
resounded
with
all
the
noise
of
its
hammers
never
had
the
breathing
of
the
giant
seemed
to
luc
more
hoarse
more
oppressed
but
again
as
on
the
previous
night
a
sound
arose
from
across
the
road
so
light
a
sound
that
he
fancied
it
was
caused
by
the
beating
wings
of
some
his
heart
suddenly
palpitated
however
when
he
heard
the
sound
afresh
for
he
recognised
a
gentle
quiver
of
approach
and
again
he
saw
a
vague
delicate
and
slender
form
which
seemed
to
float
over
the
grass
then
with
the
spring
of
a
wild
goat
a
woman
crossed
the
road
and
threw
him
a
little
bouquet
so
skilfully
that
he
once
more
received
it
on
his
lips
like
a
caress
as
on
the
previous
night
too
it
was
a
little
bunch
of
mountain
pansies
gathered
just
then
among
the
rocks
and
of
such
powerful
aroma
that
he
was
quite
perfumed
by
it
josine
josine
he
exclaimed
penetrated
by
infinite
tenderness
she
it
was
who
had
returned
and
who
naÃ¯ve
simple
like
those
very
flowers
once
again
gave
him
her
whole
soul
ever
with
the
same
gesture
of
passionate
gratitude
and
he
felt
refreshed
revived
amidst
all
the
physical
and
mental
fatigue
following
upon
so
decisive
a
day
were
not
those
flowers
already
a
reward
for
his
first
efforts
for
his
resolution
to
proceed
to
action
and
it
was
in
her
josine
that
he
loved
the
suffering
toilers
it
was
she
whom
he
wished
to
save
from
monstrous
fate
he
had
found
her
the
most
wretched
the
most
insulted
and
derided
so
near
to
debasement
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
falling
into
the
gutter
with
her
poor
hand
mutilated
by
work
she
typified
the
whole
race
of
the
victims
the
slaves
who
gave
their
flesh
for
work
or
for
pleasure
when
he
should
have
redeemed
her
he
would
have
redeemed
the
entire
race
and
she
too
was
love
love
that
is
needful
for
harmony
for
the
happiness
of
the
city
of
the
future
he
gently
called
her
josine
it
is
you
josine
but
without
a
word
she
was
already
fleeing
disappearing
into
the
darkness
of
the
uncultivated
moor
then
he
again
called
her
josine
it
is
you
i
know
it
josine
i
want
to
speak
to
you
thereupon
trembling
but
happy
she
came
back
with
the
same
light
step
and
paused
on
the
road
below
the
window
it
is
i
monsieur
luc
she
murmured
he
did
not
hasten
to
speak
however
he
was
trying
to
see
her
better
so
slim
so
vague
she
was
like
some
vision
which
a
wave
of
darkness
would
soon
carry
away
at
last
he
spoke
you
do
me
a
service
tell
bonnaire
to
come
to
speak
with
me
morning
i
have
some
good
news
for
him
i
have
found
him
some
work
she
showed
her
pleasure
by
a
laugh
tinged
with
emotion
and
so
faint
and
musical
that
it
recalled
the
warbling
of
a
bird
you
are
kind
you
are
kind
she
murmured
continued
he
in
a
lower
voice
for
he
likewise
was
feeling
moved
shall
have
work
for
all
who
wish
to
work
yes
i
am
going
to
try
to
provide
a
little
justice
and
happiness
for
everybody
she
must
have
understood
him
for
her
laugh
became
yet
more
gentle
more
expressive
of
passionate
gratitude
you
thank
you
monsieur
luc
then
the
vision
began
to
fade
and
luc
again
saw
the
light
shadow
fleeing
through
the
bushes
accompanied
by
another
and
smaller
one
nanet
whom
he
had
not
previously
seen
but
who
was
now
bounding
along
beside
his
big
sister
josine
josine
you
monsieur
luc
he
could
no
longer
distinguish
her
she
had
disappeared
but
he
still
heard
her
expressions
of
gratitude
and
joy
that
warble
which
the
night
breeze
wafted
to
him
and
it
was
instinct
with
an
infinite
charm
which
penetrated
and
enchanted
his
heart
for
a
long
time
did
he
linger
at
the
window
full
of
rapture
and
boundless
hope
between
the
abyss
where
accursed
toil
was
panting
and
la
guerdache
whose
park
formed
a
great
black
patch
upon
the
low
plain
of
la
roumagne
he
perceived
old
beauclair
the
with
its
shaky
rotting
hovels
slumbering
beneath
the
crushing
weight
of
misery
and
suffering
there
lay
the
cloaca
which
he
wished
to
purify
the
antique
gaol
of
the
which
must
be
razed
to
the
ground
with
all
its
hateful
iniquity
and
cruelty
in
order
that
mankind
might
be
cured
of
the
effects
of
the
long
efforts
to
poison
it
and
on
the
same
spot
he
was
in
imagination
already
raising
the
future
city
the
abode
of
truth
justice
and
happiness
whose
white
houses
he
could
already
picture
smiling
freely
and
fraternally
amongst
delicate
verdure
under
a
mighty
sun
of
joy
but
all
at
once
the
whole
horizon
was
illumined
a
great
pink
glow
lighted
up
the
roofs
of
beauclair
the
promontory
of
the
bleuse
mountains
the
entire
stretch
of
country
it
was
the
glow
of
liquid
metal
running
from
the
furnace
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
luc
had
at
first
taken
it
for
the
dawn
but
it
was
not
dawn
it
symbolised
rather
the
setting
of
a
planet
old
vulcan
tortured
at
his
anvil
throwing
forth
his
final
flames
work
hereafter
would
no
longer
be
aught
than
health
and
joy
was
coming
fast
book
ii
i
there
years
went
by
and
luc
established
his
new
factory
which
gave
birth
to
a
whole
town
of
workers
the
land
which
lay
below
the
ridge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
extended
over
a
space
of
some
twelve
hundred
square
yards
a
great
moor
which
sloping
slightly
stretched
from
the
park
of
la
crÃªcherie
to
the
jumbled
buildings
of
the
abyss
and
the
beginnings
were
necessarily
modest
only
a
part
of
the
moor
was
at
first
utilised
the
rest
being
reserved
for
the
extensions
which
it
was
hoped
the
future
would
justify
the
works
stood
against
the
rocky
promontory
just
below
the
with
which
they
communicated
by
two
lifts
pending
the
revolution
which
jordan
electrical
furnaces
would
effect
luc
had
done
little
to
the
smeltery
he
had
improved
it
in
a
few
matters
of
detail
and
then
left
it
in
morfain
hands
to
continue
working
according
to
routine
but
in
the
new
works
both
as
regards
the
buildings
and
the
plant
he
had
availed
himself
of
all
possible
improvements
in
order
to
increase
the
output
and
diminish
the
labour
of
the
workers
in
a
like
spirit
he
desired
that
the
houses
of
the
workers
each
of
which
stood
in
a
garden
should
be
homes
of
comfort
where
family
life
might
flourish
some
fifty
were
already
built
on
the
land
near
la
crÃªcherie
forming
quite
a
little
town
advancing
towards
beauclair
the
building
of
each
new
house
indeed
was
like
a
fresh
step
taken
by
the
future
city
towards
the
conquest
of
the
old
guilty
and
condemned
one
then
in
the
centre
of
the
land
luc
had
erected
the
a
large
building
containing
schools
a
library
a
hall
for
meetings
and
festivities
baths
and
so
forth
this
was
all
that
he
had
retained
of
fourier
phalanstery
leaving
everybody
free
to
build
as
he
pleased
and
only
deeming
collective
action
to
be
necessary
for
certain
public
services
finally
in
the
rear
of
the
property
some
general
stores
had
been
established
and
grew
daily
in
importance
there
was
a
bakery
a
butcher
a
grocery
department
not
to
mention
others
for
clothes
utensils
all
sorts
of
small
indispensable
articles
the
whole
being
conducted
on
the
principles
of
a
cooperative
society
of
consumers
corresponding
with
the
cooperative
society
of
producers
which
controlled
the
works
all
this
no
doubt
was
simply
a
beginning
but
there
was
no
dearth
of
life
and
one
could
already
see
and
judge
the
work
luc
would
not
have
succeeded
in
making
such
rapid
progress
had
not
the
happy
thought
occurred
to
him
of
interesting
workmen
of
the
building
trades
in
the
enterprise
one
thing
too
which
particularly
delighted
him
was
that
he
had
managed
to
capture
all
the
springs
scattered
among
the
higher
rocks
for
they
yielded
an
abundance
of
fresh
and
pure
water
which
cleansed
the
works
and
the
gave
moisture
to
the
gardens
where
thick
greenery
arose
and
brought
health
and
delight
to
every
home
now
one
morning
fauchard
the
drawer
at
the
abyss
came
strolling
up
to
la
crÃªcherie
to
see
some
of
his
old
mates
he
ever
undecided
and
doleful
had
remained
under
delaveau
whereas
bonnaire
had
repaired
to
the
new
works
taking
with
him
his
ragu
who
in
his
turn
had
induced
bourron
to
follow
those
three
then
worked
with
luc
and
fauchard
wished
to
question
them
in
the
state
of
hebetude
to
which
fifteen
years
of
labour
ever
the
same
ever
a
repetition
of
similar
gestures
amidst
a
similar
glare
had
reduced
him
he
felt
incapable
of
arriving
at
any
decision
by
himself
such
indeed
had
become
his
indolence
of
mind
that
for
long
months
he
had
been
thinking
of
this
visit
without
finding
sufficient
strength
of
will
to
make
it
from
the
moment
of
entering
the
works
of
la
crÃªcherie
he
felt
astonished
coming
as
he
did
from
the
grimy
dusty
abyss
into
whose
heavy
tumbledown
halls
the
light
scarcely
entered
he
marvelled
in
the
first
instance
at
the
sight
of
the
light
airy
halls
of
la
crÃªcherie
all
brick
and
iron
through
whose
broad
windows
the
sunshine
streamed
all
the
workshops
were
paved
with
slabs
of
cement
in
such
wise
that
there
was
little
dust
and
the
abundance
of
water
facilitated
frequent
washings
moreover
the
place
remained
clean
and
was
easily
kept
in
such
a
condition
by
reason
of
the
new
apparatus
with
which
all
the
fires
were
provided
thus
in
lieu
of
an
infernal
cyclopean
den
there
were
bright
shiny
spacious
workshops
in
which
toil
seemed
to
lose
much
of
its
harshness
no
doubt
the
employment
of
electricity
was
still
very
limited
there
was
still
a
deafening
roar
of
machinery
and
but
little
relief
had
been
found
for
human
efforts
only
among
some
of
the
furnaces
had
there
been
trials
of
mechanical
appliances
which
although
hitherto
defective
encouraged
the
hope
that
man
would
some
day
be
freed
from
excessive
labour
at
la
crÃªcherie
they
were
feeling
their
way
so
to
say
and
yet
how
great
was
the
improvement
which
already
resulted
from
cleanliness
air
and
sunlight
fauchard
had
expected
to
find
bonnaire
the
at
his
furnace
and
was
surprised
to
come
upon
him
watching
over
a
large
for
the
making
of
rails
exclaimed
the
visitor
you
given
up
puddling
then
bonnaire
replied
we
do
a
little
bit
of
everything
here
that
the
rule
of
the
place
two
hours
on
one
thing
two
hours
on
another
and
really
it
quite
true
that
it
rests
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
luc
did
not
easily
induce
the
men
whom
he
took
on
to
quit
whatever
might
be
their
specialty
later
however
reforms
would
be
realised
for
the
children
were
already
passing
through
several
apprenticeships
since
work
could
only
be
made
attractive
by
varying
it
and
giving
but
a
few
hours
to
any
one
particular
form
sighed
fauchard
it
just
amuse
me
to
do
something
else
than
draw
crucibles
out
of
my
furnace
but
then
i
ca
i
do
know
how
the
noise
made
by
the
was
so
violent
that
he
had
to
raise
his
voice
to
its
highest
pitch
at
last
he
profited
by
a
brief
interval
to
shake
hands
with
ragu
and
bourron
who
were
busily
engaged
in
receiving
the
rails
all
this
again
was
quite
a
sight
for
fauchard
the
rails
were
not
made
in
the
same
way
as
at
the
abyss
he
looked
at
them
with
confused
thoughts
which
he
could
not
have
put
into
words
that
which
more
particularly
made
him
suffer
amidst
his
downfall
reduced
as
he
was
to
the
status
of
a
mere
tool
was
the
dim
consciousness
that
he
might
have
been
a
man
of
intelligence
and
will
it
was
indeed
so
sad
to
think
what
a
free
healthy
joyful
man
he
might
have
become
if
slavery
had
not
cast
him
into
that
brutifying
gaol
the
abyss
the
rails
which
ever
grew
longer
before
his
eyes
seemed
to
him
like
an
endless
railroad
over
which
his
thoughts
glided
away
into
the
future
of
which
he
had
neither
hope
nor
clear
conception
under
the
hall
adjacent
to
the
great
foundry
the
steel
was
melted
in
a
special
furnace
and
the
fusing
metal
was
received
in
a
large
pocket
lined
with
refractory
clay
which
afterwards
discharged
it
into
moulds
electrical
rolling
bridges
powerful
cranes
raised
and
transported
the
heavy
masses
brought
them
to
the
and
conveyed
them
to
the
riveting
and
bolting
workshops
there
were
various
sorts
of
some
of
them
gigantic
one
for
large
pieces
of
steel
required
for
bridges
for
the
frameworks
of
buildings
and
so
forth
and
others
for
such
simple
things
as
girders
and
rails
whose
dimensions
did
not
vary
these
were
made
with
extraordinary
speed
and
regularity
the
steel
billet
as
dazzling
as
the
sun
but
short
and
as
thick
as
a
man
trunk
was
caught
in
the
first
cage
between
two
rollers
revolving
inversely
and
when
it
came
forth
from
the
throat
it
was
already
more
slender
but
it
entered
a
second
cage
and
came
forth
more
slender
still
and
thus
from
cage
to
cage
it
was
gradually
shaped
till
it
at
last
assumed
the
correct
outline
and
the
regulation
length
of
ten
mÃ¨tres
all
this
however
was
not
accomplished
without
a
deafening
uproar
a
terrible
noise
of
jaws
between
the
cages
something
akin
to
the
mastication
of
a
colossus
whom
one
could
imagine
munching
all
that
steel
and
rails
succeeded
rails
with
extraordinary
rapidity
you
could
scarcely
follow
the
billet
as
it
grew
thinner
and
longer
and
sprang
out
at
last
as
a
rail
to
be
added
to
others
and
others
as
if
indeed
railways
were
extending
endlessly
penetrating
into
the
depths
of
the
least
known
lands
and
girdling
the
whole
earth
all
that
for
asked
fauchard
in
his
bewilderment
the
chinese
answered
ragu
by
way
of
a
joke
but
luc
was
now
passing
the
he
generally
spent
his
mornings
in
the
works
glancing
into
each
hall
and
chatting
like
a
mate
with
the
men
he
had
been
compelled
to
retain
part
of
the
old
hierarchy
master
workmen
foremen
engineers
and
an
office
staff
for
and
commercial
management
nevertheless
he
already
effected
considerable
economy
by
constant
care
in
reducing
the
number
of
managers
and
clerks
on
the
other
hand
his
immediate
hopes
had
been
realised
although
lodes
like
those
of
former
times
had
not
yet
been
found
in
the
mine
the
ore
now
extracted
yielded
by
chemical
treatment
cheap
iron
of
fair
quality
in
such
wise
that
the
manufacture
of
girders
and
rails
being
sufficiently
remunerative
ensured
the
prosperity
of
the
works
they
paid
their
way
the
amount
of
business
increased
each
year
and
this
was
the
important
point
for
luc
whose
efforts
were
directed
towards
the
future
of
the
enterprise
convinced
as
he
was
that
he
should
conquer
if
at
each
division
of
profits
the
workmen
saw
their
comfort
and
happiness
increase
none
the
less
his
daily
life
was
full
of
alarms
amidst
that
complicated
creation
of
his
there
were
considerable
advances
to
make
an
entire
little
army
to
lead
and
worries
assailed
him
both
as
a
reformer
as
an
engineer
and
as
a
financier
success
seemed
certain
yet
he
fully
understood
that
the
enterprise
was
still
in
a
precarious
stage
at
the
mercy
of
events
amidst
the
uproar
he
only
paused
for
a
moment
to
smile
at
bonnaire
ragu
and
bourron
and
he
did
not
even
notice
fauchard
he
liked
that
hall
where
the
was
installed
he
was
cheered
by
the
sight
of
all
the
girders
and
rails
made
there
it
was
the
good
forge
of
peace
he
sometimes
exclaimed
gaily
and
he
contrasted
it
with
the
evil
forge
of
war
that
neighbouring
forge
the
abyss
where
guns
and
projectiles
were
made
at
such
great
cost
and
with
so
much
care
to
think
of
it
such
perfect
appliances
metal
worked
with
so
much
delicacy
and
skill
and
all
that
simply
to
produce
monstrous
engines
of
warfare
which
cost
nations
millions
upon
millions
and
ruined
them
whilst
they
waited
for
war
when
indeed
war
did
not
arise
to
exterminate
them
ah
might
the
steel
girders
and
frameworks
be
multiplied
might
they
build
up
useful
edifices
and
happy
cities
bridges
to
cross
rivers
and
valleys
might
rails
for
ever
gush
from
the
presses
and
form
endless
lines
to
abolish
frontiers
bring
nations
together
and
win
the
whole
world
over
to
the
brotherly
civilisation
of
however
just
as
luc
passed
into
the
large
foundry
where
the
great
began
to
pound
away
forging
the
armature
of
a
gigantic
bridge
the
was
suddenly
stopped
and
an
interval
ensued
pending
the
starting
of
another
section
fauchard
then
drew
nearer
to
his
old
mates
and
some
conversation
ensued
between
them
things
are
going
all
right
here
you
are
satisfied
eh
he
inquired
no
doubt
bonnaire
replied
working
day
is
only
one
of
eight
hours
and
as
what
one
does
is
diversified
one
does
get
so
tired
as
formerly
and
the
work
seems
pleasanter
he
so
tall
and
strong
with
his
broad
healthy
face
was
one
of
the
chief
mainstays
of
the
new
works
he
belonged
to
the
council
of
management
and
felt
very
grateful
to
luc
for
having
taken
him
on
at
the
moment
when
he
had
been
obliged
to
quit
the
abyss
and
could
not
think
of
the
morrow
without
apprehension
with
his
uncompromising
collectivist
principles
however
he
suffered
at
seeing
la
crÃªcherie
governed
by
a
of
mere
association
in
which
capital
retained
its
great
influence
the
revolutionary
within
him
the
dreamer
of
the
absolute
protested
against
such
a
thing
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
sensible
he
worked
and
urged
his
mates
to
work
with
all
devotion
until
they
should
be
able
to
judge
the
result
of
the
experiment
so
resumed
fauchard
earn
a
lot
of
money
double
what
you
used
to
eh
ragu
with
that
evil
laugh
of
his
began
to
jest
the
double
indeed
say
a
hundred
francs
a
day
without
counting
the
champagne
and
the
cigars
he
had
simply
followed
bonnaire
example
in
taking
work
at
la
crÃªcherie
and
though
he
did
not
find
himself
badly
off
thanks
to
the
relative
comfort
he
enjoyed
there
on
the
other
hand
the
orderliness
and
preciseness
of
everything
could
scarcely
be
to
his
taste
for
he
was
again
becoming
a
railer
turning
his
happiness
into
derision
hundred
francs
cried
fauchard
in
stupefaction
earn
a
hundred
francs
you
do
bourron
who
still
remained
ragu
shadow
then
tried
to
improve
on
what
his
mate
had
said
a
hundred
francs
just
to
begin
with
said
he
one
is
treated
to
the
roundabouts
on
sundays
but
whilst
the
others
sneered
bonnaire
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
disdainful
gravity
you
see
he
exclaimed
they
are
talking
folly
and
making
fun
of
you
everything
considered
after
the
division
of
the
profits
our
daily
earnings
do
not
amount
to
much
more
than
they
did
formerly
only
at
each
settlement
they
increase
a
little
and
it
certain
that
they
will
some
day
become
superb
then
too
we
have
all
sorts
of
advantages
our
future
is
assured
and
living
costs
us
much
less
than
formerly
thanks
to
our
stores
and
the
gay
little
houses
which
are
let
to
us
almost
for
nothing
certainly
this
is
yet
real
justice
but
all
the
same
we
are
on
the
road
to
it
ragu
continued
sneering
and
a
desire
came
to
him
to
satisfy
another
hatred
for
if
he
jested
about
la
crÃªcherie
he
never
spoke
of
the
abyss
otherwise
than
with
ferocious
rancour
what
kind
of
face
does
that
animal
delaveau
pull
nowadays
he
inquired
amuses
me
to
think
that
he
must
be
quite
wild
at
having
another
show
erected
close
to
his
own
and
one
too
that
seems
likely
to
do
good
business
he
in
a
rage
is
he
fauchard
waved
his
arm
vaguely
and
replied
course
he
must
be
in
a
rage
only
he
does
show
it
over
much
and
yet
i
really
do
know
because
i
enough
worries
of
my
own
without
troubling
about
those
of
other
people
i
heard
say
that
he
does
care
a
fig
about
your
works
and
the
competition
he
says
it
seems
that
cannons
and
shells
will
always
be
wanted
because
men
are
fools
and
will
always
go
on
murdering
one
another
luc
who
was
just
then
returning
from
the
foundry
heard
those
last
words
for
three
years
past
since
the
day
when
he
had
prevailed
on
jordan
to
keep
the
and
establish
forges
and
he
had
known
that
he
had
an
enemy
in
delaveau
the
blow
had
been
a
severe
one
for
the
latter
who
had
hoped
to
acquire
la
crÃªcherie
for
a
comparatively
small
sum
payable
over
a
term
of
years
and
who
in
lieu
thereof
saw
it
pass
into
the
hands
of
an
audacious
young
man
full
of
intelligence
and
activity
possessed
of
such
creative
vigour
that
at
the
very
outset
of
his
operations
he
raised
the
nucleus
of
a
town
nevertheless
after
the
anger
born
of
his
first
shock
of
surprise
delaveau
had
felt
full
of
confidence
he
would
confine
himself
to
the
manufacture
of
ordnance
and
projectiles
in
which
line
the
profits
were
large
ones
and
in
which
he
feared
no
competition
the
announcement
that
the
neighbouring
works
would
resume
the
making
of
rails
and
girders
had
at
first
filled
him
with
merriment
ignorant
as
he
was
that
the
mine
would
be
worked
afresh
then
on
understanding
the
situation
realising
that
large
profits
might
be
made
by
treating
the
defective
ore
chemically
he
did
not
lose
his
temper
but
declared
to
everybody
that
there
was
room
for
all
enterprises
and
that
he
would
willingly
leave
the
making
of
rails
and
girders
to
his
fortunate
neighbour
if
the
latter
left
him
that
of
guns
and
shells
in
appearance
then
peace
was
not
disturbed
cold
but
polite
intercourse
was
kept
up
but
in
the
depths
of
delaveau
mind
lurked
covert
anxiety
a
fear
of
that
centre
of
just
and
free
work
so
near
to
him
for
in
time
its
spirit
might
gain
upon
his
own
workshops
and
men
and
there
was
yet
other
uneasiness
on
his
part
an
unacknowledged
feeling
that
old
scaffoldings
were
gradually
cracking
under
him
that
there
were
causes
of
rottenness
which
he
could
not
control
and
that
on
the
day
when
the
power
of
capital
might
fail
him
his
arms
however
stubborn
and
vigorous
they
might
be
would
prove
powerless
to
keep
up
the
edifice
which
would
fall
in
its
entirety
to
the
ground
in
the
inevitable
and
ever
fiercer
warfare
which
had
begun
between
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
abyss
and
which
could
only
end
by
the
downfall
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
works
luc
felt
no
pity
for
the
delaveaus
if
he
had
some
esteem
for
the
man
on
seeing
how
energetically
he
worked
and
how
bravely
he
defended
his
opinions
he
despised
the
woman
fernande
though
with
his
contempt
there
was
mingled
a
kind
of
terror
on
divining
in
her
a
terrible
force
of
corruption
and
destruction
that
evil
intrigue
which
he
had
detected
at
la
guerdache
the
imperious
subjugation
of
boisgelin
that
coxcomb
whose
fortune
was
melting
away
in
the
hands
of
a
devouring
creature
filled
him
with
growing
anxiety
as
if
he
foresaw
in
it
some
future
tragedy
all
his
affection
went
out
towards
the
and
gentle
suzanne
for
she
was
the
real
victim
the
only
one
worthy
of
his
pity
he
had
been
compelled
to
break
off
all
intercourse
with
la
guerdache
and
his
only
knowledge
of
what
went
on
there
was
derived
from
chance
reports
these
indicated
however
that
things
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
fernande
wild
demands
increasing
whilst
suzanne
only
found
energy
to
remain
silent
closing
her
eyes
for
fear
of
some
scandal
one
day
when
luc
met
her
holding
her
little
boy
paul
by
the
hand
in
one
of
the
streets
of
beauclair
she
gave
him
a
long
look
in
which
he
could
read
all
her
distress
and
the
friendship
that
she
still
retained
for
him
in
spite
of
the
deadly
struggle
which
now
parted
their
lives
as
soon
as
luc
recognised
fauchard
he
put
himself
on
the
defensive
for
it
was
part
of
his
plan
to
avoid
all
unnecessary
conflicts
with
the
abyss
he
was
willing
that
men
should
come
from
the
neighbouring
works
to
offer
their
services
but
he
did
not
wish
it
to
be
said
that
he
tried
to
attract
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
workers
of
la
crÃªcherie
who
decided
whether
a
new
hand
should
be
admitted
or
not
accordingly
as
bonnaire
had
on
various
previous
occasions
spoken
to
him
of
fauchard
luc
feigned
a
belief
that
the
latter
was
trying
to
gain
admittance
from
his
former
comrades
it
you
my
friend
said
he
come
to
see
if
your
old
mates
will
make
room
for
you
eh
the
other
once
more
full
of
doubt
incapable
of
prompt
resolution
began
to
stammer
disjointed
words
all
novelty
frightened
him
accustomed
as
he
was
to
blind
routine
those
new
works
those
large
light
clean
halls
filled
him
with
emotion
as
if
they
formed
part
of
some
awesome
place
where
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
live
he
was
already
eager
to
return
to
his
black
and
ragu
had
derided
him
what
was
the
good
of
changing
when
nothing
was
certain
besides
he
dimly
realised
perhaps
that
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
make
a
change
no
monsieur
not
yet
he
stuttered
should
like
to
but
i
do
know
i
see
a
little
later
i
consult
my
wife
luc
smiled
so
quite
so
one
has
to
please
the
women
my
friend
then
fauchard
went
off
in
an
awkward
way
astonished
at
the
turn
that
his
visit
had
taken
for
he
had
certainly
made
it
with
the
intention
of
asking
for
work
if
he
found
the
place
to
his
liking
and
one
could
earn
more
money
there
than
at
the
abyss
for
a
moment
luc
remained
speaking
to
bonnaire
about
some
improvements
which
he
wished
to
introduce
into
the
but
ragu
had
a
complaint
to
make
luc
said
he
gust
of
wind
has
broken
three
more
panes
in
the
window
of
our
and
i
must
warn
you
that
this
time
we
really
wo
pay
it
all
comes
from
our
house
being
the
first
in
the
line
of
the
wind
that
comes
from
the
plain
one
freezes
in
it
he
was
always
complaining
always
finding
reasons
for
discontent
it
very
simple
monsieur
luc
he
added
only
got
to
call
at
our
house
to
see
how
it
happens
josine
will
show
you
since
ragu
had
been
working
at
la
crÃªcherie
sÅurette
had
prevailed
on
him
to
marry
josine
and
thus
they
lived
together
in
one
of
the
little
houses
of
the
new
town
of
workers
a
house
which
stood
between
those
of
bonnaire
and
bourron
as
ragu
had
considerably
amended
his
ways
thanks
to
his
new
surroundings
there
did
not
as
yet
seem
to
be
any
serious
disagreement
in
his
home
only
a
few
quarrels
had
broken
out
caused
chiefly
by
the
presence
of
nanet
who
also
lived
in
the
house
moreover
whenever
josine
was
sorrowful
and
inclined
to
shed
tears
she
carefully
closed
the
window
in
order
that
her
neighbours
might
not
hear
her
weeping
but
a
shadow
had
passed
over
luc
brow
well
ragu
he
simply
said
will
call
at
your
house
then
the
conversation
ceased
the
machinery
had
begun
to
work
once
more
drowning
the
voices
of
one
and
all
with
a
tremendous
noise
which
suggested
the
mastication
of
a
giant
for
another
moment
luc
watched
the
work
smiling
at
bonnaire
encouraging
bourron
and
ragu
striving
to
promote
brotherly
love
among
each
gang
of
workers
for
he
was
convinced
that
nothing
can
prove
substantial
and
effective
if
love
be
lacking
at
last
he
quitted
the
workshops
and
repaired
to
the
as
he
did
each
morning
in
order
to
visit
the
schools
if
it
pleased
him
to
linger
in
the
halls
of
work
dreaming
of
future
peace
he
tasted
the
delight
of
a
yet
keener
hope
among
the
little
world
of
children
by
whom
the
future
was
personified
the
naturally
enough
was
as
yet
only
a
large
clean
gay
building
in
erecting
which
luc
had
aimed
at
little
beyond
making
the
place
as
commodious
as
possible
at
a
small
cost
the
schools
occupied
one
wing
of
it
the
library
and
baths
being
installed
in
the
other
one
whilst
the
meeting
and
together
with
various
offices
occupied
the
central
pile
the
schools
were
divided
into
three
distinct
sections
first
a
kind
of
infant
asylum
where
mothers
following
various
avocations
could
place
their
little
ones
even
when
these
were
mere
babes
in
swaddling
clothes
secondly
a
school
proper
comprising
five
divisions
in
which
a
complete
system
of
education
was
in
force
and
thirdly
a
series
of
workshops
for
apprentices
the
pupils
frequented
the
latter
even
whilst
following
their
studies
acquiring
familiarity
with
manual
callings
as
their
general
knowledge
developed
and
the
sexes
were
not
separated
boys
and
girls
grew
up
side
by
side
from
the
cradle
to
the
workshop
of
apprenticeship
which
they
quitted
in
order
to
marry
passing
meantime
through
the
five
classes
of
the
school
where
they
sat
side
by
side
on
the
forms
mingling
there
as
they
were
bound
to
mingle
in
after
life
to
separate
the
sexes
from
infancy
to
bring
up
boys
and
girls
and
educate
them
differently
one
in
ignorance
of
the
other
does
not
this
render
them
inimical
and
does
it
not
tend
to
pervert
them
by
heightening
the
mystery
of
the
laws
of
natural
attraction
peace
will
only
be
complete
between
the
sexes
on
the
common
interest
which
ought
to
unite
them
becoming
apparent
to
both
reared
as
comrades
knowing
one
another
deriving
their
knowledge
of
life
from
the
same
source
and
setting
forth
on
its
road
in
order
to
live
it
logically
and
healthily
even
as
it
ought
to
be
lived
sÅurette
had
greatly
aided
luc
in
organising
the
schools
whilst
jordan
after
giving
the
money
he
had
promised
had
shut
himself
up
in
his
laboratory
refusing
to
examine
accounts
or
to
discuss
what
measures
should
be
adopted
his
sister
had
begun
to
take
a
passionate
interest
in
that
new
town
which
she
saw
germinating
rising
before
her
eyes
the
feelings
of
a
teacher
and
a
nurse
had
always
been
latent
within
her
and
her
benevolence
which
hitherto
had
been
unable
to
go
beyond
a
few
poor
folk
pointed
out
to
her
by
abbÃ©
marle
doctor
novarre
or
hermeline
the
schoolmaster
suddenly
expanded
in
presence
of
luc
large
family
of
workers
who
needed
to
be
taught
and
guided
and
loved
she
had
at
the
outset
chosen
her
special
task
she
did
not
refuse
to
help
in
organising
the
classes
and
the
workshops
for
the
apprentices
but
she
more
particularly
devoted
herself
to
the
where
she
spent
her
mornings
satisfying
her
love
for
the
little
ones
one
day
when
it
was
suggested
that
she
ought
to
marry
she
replied
with
some
slight
confusion
and
a
pretty
laugh
i
all
the
children
of
others
to
look
after
she
had
ended
by
finding
an
assistant
in
josine
who
although
now
married
to
ragu
remained
childless
each
morning
sÅurette
employed
her
among
the
infants
and
drawn
together
as
they
were
by
solicitude
for
the
little
ones
they
had
become
good
friends
however
different
in
other
respects
might
be
the
bent
of
their
natures
that
morning
when
luc
entered
the
white
cool
ward
he
found
sÅurette
alone
there
has
been
she
explained
sent
word
that
she
was
not
feeling
well
oh
it
merely
a
trifling
indisposition
i
believe
to
luc
however
there
came
a
vague
suspicion
and
a
shadow
again
darkened
his
glance
have
to
call
at
her
house
i
will
see
if
she
needs
anything
he
simply
replied
then
came
the
delightful
visit
to
the
cradles
they
stood
all
white
alongside
the
white
walls
little
pink
faces
lay
smiling
or
sleeping
in
them
and
there
were
some
willing
women
with
large
dazzling
aprons
soft
eyes
and
motherly
hands
who
speaking
gentle
words
watched
over
all
those
little
ones
those
germs
of
humanity
in
whom
the
future
was
rising
some
of
the
children
however
were
growing
fast
there
were
little
men
and
little
women
of
three
and
four
years
of
age
and
these
were
at
liberty
toddling
or
running
about
on
their
little
legs
without
encountering
too
many
falls
the
ward
opened
on
to
a
flowery
verandah
whence
a
garden
extended
and
the
whole
troop
disported
itself
in
sunshine
and
warm
air
toys
such
as
jumping
jacks
hung
down
from
strings
to
amuse
the
smallest
whilst
the
others
had
dolls
or
horses
or
carts
which
they
dragged
about
noisily
like
future
heroes
in
whom
the
need
of
action
was
awaking
and
it
warmed
the
heart
to
see
those
young
folk
growing
thus
gaily
and
in
comfort
for
all
the
tasks
of
ill
asked
luc
who
lingered
with
delight
amidst
all
the
whiteness
no
they
are
all
lively
this
morning
sÅurette
replied
had
two
children
taken
with
the
measles
the
day
before
yesterday
but
i
did
not
receive
them
afterwards
they
have
been
isolated
she
and
luc
had
now
gone
out
to
the
verandah
along
which
they
went
to
visit
the
adjoining
school
the
glazed
doors
of
the
five
followed
one
after
the
other
allowing
a
view
over
the
greenery
of
the
garden
and
the
weather
being
warm
these
doors
were
at
that
moment
wide
open
in
such
wise
that
luc
and
sÅurette
were
able
to
glance
into
each
room
without
entering
since
the
establishment
of
the
school
the
masters
had
arranged
quite
a
new
programme
of
education
from
the
first
class
in
which
they
took
the
child
before
he
could
even
read
to
the
fifth
in
which
they
parted
from
him
after
teaching
him
the
elements
of
general
knowledge
necessary
to
life
they
particularly
strove
to
place
him
in
presence
of
things
and
facts
in
order
that
he
might
derive
his
learning
from
the
realities
of
the
world
they
also
sought
to
awaken
a
spirit
of
orderliness
and
method
in
each
child
for
without
method
there
can
be
no
useful
work
it
is
method
which
classifies
and
enables
one
to
go
on
learning
without
losing
aught
of
the
knowledge
one
has
already
acquired
the
science
of
books
was
not
condemned
in
the
school
at
la
crÃªcherie
but
it
was
put
back
to
its
rightful
secondary
place
for
a
child
only
learns
well
such
things
as
he
sees
touches
or
understands
by
himself
he
was
no
longer
bent
like
a
slave
over
indisputable
dogmas
his
masters
appealed
to
his
initiative
to
discover
penetrate
and
make
the
truth
his
own
by
this
system
the
individual
energy
of
each
pupil
was
awakened
and
stimulated
in
like
manner
punishments
and
rewards
had
been
abolished
no
further
recourse
was
had
to
threats
or
caresses
to
force
idle
lads
to
work
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
no
idlers
there
are
only
ailing
children
children
who
understand
badly
what
is
badly
explained
to
them
children
into
whose
brains
obstinate
attempts
are
made
to
force
knowledge
for
which
they
are
not
prepared
this
being
so
in
order
to
have
good
pupils
at
la
crÃªcherie
it
was
found
sufficient
to
utilise
the
immense
craving
for
knowledge
which
glows
within
each
human
being
that
inextinguishable
curiosity
of
the
child
for
all
that
surrounds
him
a
curiosity
so
great
that
he
never
ceases
to
weary
people
with
questions
thus
learning
ceased
to
be
torture
it
became
a
constant
pleasure
by
being
rendered
attractive
the
master
contenting
himself
with
arousing
the
child
intelligence
and
then
simply
guiding
it
in
its
discoveries
each
has
the
right
and
the
duty
to
develop
himself
and
is
necessary
if
one
wishes
a
child
to
become
a
real
man
of
active
energy
with
to
decide
and
direct
thus
the
five
classes
spread
out
offering
from
the
very
first
notions
to
the
acquirement
of
all
the
scientific
truths
a
means
for
the
logical
graduated
emancipation
of
the
intelligence
in
the
garden
gymnastic
appliances
were
installed
there
were
games
exercises
of
all
kinds
in
order
that
the
body
might
be
fortified
provided
with
health
and
strength
whilst
the
brain
developed
and
enriched
itself
with
learning
in
the
first
classes
especially
a
great
deal
of
time
was
allowed
for
play
and
recreation
at
the
outset
only
short
and
varied
studies
proportionate
to
the
child
powers
of
endurance
were
required
the
rule
was
to
confine
the
children
within
doors
as
little
as
possible
lessons
were
frequently
given
in
the
open
air
walks
were
arranged
and
the
pupils
were
taught
amidst
the
things
on
which
their
lessons
turned
now
in
workshops
now
in
presence
of
the
phenomena
of
nature
among
animals
and
plants
or
beside
watercourses
and
mountains
then
too
efforts
were
made
to
give
the
children
a
notion
of
what
mankind
really
was
and
of
the
necessity
for
solidarity
they
were
growing
up
side
by
side
they
would
always
live
side
by
side
love
alone
was
the
bond
of
union
justice
and
happiness
in
love
was
found
the
indispensable
and
social
compact
for
it
was
sufficient
for
men
to
love
one
another
to
ensure
the
reign
of
peace
that
universal
love
which
will
spread
in
time
from
the
family
to
the
nation
and
from
the
nation
to
all
mankind
will
be
the
sole
law
of
the
happy
community
of
the
future
it
was
developed
among
the
children
at
la
crÃªcherie
by
interesting
them
in
one
another
the
strong
being
taught
to
watch
over
the
weak
and
all
giving
rein
to
their
studies
diversions
and
budding
passions
in
common
from
all
this
would
arise
the
awaited
harvest
men
fortified
by
bodily
exercise
instructed
in
experience
amidst
nature
drawn
together
by
brain
and
heart
and
in
this
wise
becoming
true
brothers
however
some
laughter
and
some
shouts
suddenly
arose
and
luc
felt
a
little
anxious
for
at
times
things
did
not
pass
off
without
disorder
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
he
perceived
nanet
standing
up
it
was
he
no
doubt
who
had
caused
the
tumult
nanet
still
give
you
trouble
he
asked
sÅurette
a
little
demon
i
fear
she
smiled
and
made
a
gesture
of
indulgent
excuse
he
is
not
always
easily
managed
she
said
we
have
others
too
who
are
very
turbulent
they
push
and
fight
one
another
and
show
little
obedience
but
all
the
same
they
are
dear
little
fellows
nanet
is
very
brave
and
besides
when
they
keep
we
feel
anxious
we
imagine
that
they
must
be
after
the
beyond
the
garden
came
the
workshops
for
the
apprentices
instruction
was
given
there
in
the
principal
manual
callings
which
the
children
practised
less
in
order
to
acquire
them
perfectly
than
to
form
an
acquaintance
with
their
and
determine
their
own
vocations
this
teaching
went
on
concurrently
with
the
other
studies
whilst
a
child
was
acquiring
the
first
notions
of
reading
and
writing
a
tool
was
already
placed
in
his
hand
and
if
during
the
morning
he
studied
grammar
arithmetic
and
history
thereby
ripening
his
intelligence
in
the
afternoon
he
worked
with
his
little
arms
in
order
to
impart
vigour
and
skill
to
his
muscles
this
was
like
useful
recreation
rest
for
the
brain
a
joyous
competition
in
activity
the
principle
was
adopted
that
every
man
ought
to
know
a
manual
calling
in
such
wise
that
each
pupil
on
leaving
the
school
simply
had
to
choose
the
calling
he
himself
preferred
and
perfect
himself
in
it
in
a
real
workshop
in
like
manner
beauty
flourished
the
children
passed
through
courses
of
music
drawing
painting
and
sculpture
and
in
souls
that
were
well
awakened
the
joys
of
existence
were
then
born
even
for
those
who
had
to
confine
themselves
to
the
first
elements
such
studies
tended
to
an
enlargement
of
the
world
the
whole
earth
taking
a
voice
and
splendour
in
one
or
another
form
embellishing
the
humblest
lives
and
in
the
garden
at
the
close
of
fine
days
amidst
radiant
sunsets
the
children
were
gathered
together
to
sing
songs
of
peace
and
glory
or
to
be
braced
by
spectacles
of
truth
and
immortal
beauty
luc
was
finishing
his
daily
visit
when
he
was
informed
that
two
peasants
of
les
combettes
lenfant
and
yvonnot
were
waiting
to
speak
to
him
in
the
little
office
opening
into
the
large
they
come
about
the
stream
asked
sÅurette
he
replied
asked
me
to
fix
an
appointment
and
for
my
part
i
greatly
desired
to
see
them
for
i
was
talking
again
to
feuillat
only
the
other
day
and
i
am
convinced
that
an
understanding
is
necessary
between
la
crÃªcherie
and
les
combettes
if
we
desire
to
win
the
day
she
listened
to
him
smiling
like
one
who
knew
all
his
plans
and
after
pressing
his
hand
she
returned
with
her
discreet
quiet
step
to
her
white
cradles
whence
would
arise
the
future
people
that
he
needed
for
the
fulfilment
of
his
dream
feuillat
the
farmer
of
la
guerdache
had
ended
by
renewing
his
lease
with
boisgelin
under
disastrous
conditions
for
both
parties
but
it
was
necessary
to
live
as
feuillat
said
and
the
farming
system
had
become
so
defective
that
it
could
no
longer
yield
any
good
results
it
was
leading
indeed
to
the
very
bankruptcy
of
the
soil
and
so
feuillat
like
the
stubborn
man
he
was
haunted
by
an
idea
which
he
imparted
to
nobody
covertly
continued
urging
on
certain
experimental
work
which
he
desired
to
see
tried
near
his
farm
that
is
the
reconciliation
of
the
peasants
of
les
combettes
whom
ancient
hatreds
parted
the
gathering
together
in
a
commonalty
of
all
their
patches
of
land
now
cut
up
into
little
strips
and
the
creation
of
one
great
estate
whence
they
would
derive
real
wealth
by
applying
the
principles
of
high
cultivation
on
a
large
scale
and
the
idea
which
feuillat
kept
back
in
the
depths
of
his
mind
most
have
been
that
of
persuading
boisgelin
to
let
the
farm
enter
the
new
association
when
the
first
experiments
should
have
succeeded
if
boisgelin
should
refuse
facts
would
end
by
compelling
him
to
consent
in
feuillat
moreover
silent
man
that
he
was
bending
beneath
such
servitude
as
appeared
inevitable
there
was
something
of
the
nature
of
a
patient
crafty
apostle
who
was
resolved
to
gain
ground
by
degrees
undeterred
therefrom
by
any
feeling
of
weariness
he
had
just
achieved
a
first
success
by
reconciling
lenfant
and
yvonnot
whose
families
had
been
quarrelling
for
centuries
the
former
having
been
chosen
mayor
of
the
village
and
the
latter
or
deputy
mayor
he
had
given
them
to
understand
that
they
would
be
the
real
masters
if
they
could
only
agree
together
then
he
had
slowly
won
them
to
his
idea
of
a
general
agreement
by
which
alone
the
village
could
emerge
from
the
wretchedness
born
of
routine
in
which
it
vegetated
and
once
more
find
in
the
earth
an
inexhaustible
source
of
fortune
as
the
works
of
la
crÃªcherie
were
at
that
time
being
established
he
cited
them
as
an
example
spoke
of
their
growing
prosperity
and
profiting
by
some
water
question
which
had
to
be
settled
between
la
crÃªcherie
and
les
combettes
he
even
ended
by
putting
lenfant
and
yvonnot
in
communication
with
luc
thus
it
was
that
the
village
mayor
and
his
deputy
happened
that
morning
to
be
at
the
works
luc
immediately
consented
to
what
they
came
to
ask
him
and
the
good
nature
he
evinced
in
doing
so
in
some
degree
dispelled
their
habitual
distrust
understood
messieurs
said
he
crÃªcherie
will
henceforth
canalise
all
the
springs
captured
among
the
rocks
and
turn
those
which
it
does
not
employ
into
the
rivulet
which
crosses
the
lands
of
your
village
before
joining
the
mionne
at
little
cost
if
you
only
establish
some
reservoirs
you
will
have
abundant
means
for
watering
your
land
and
increasing
its
bearing
qualities
three
times
over
lenfant
who
was
short
and
stout
wagged
his
big
head
and
reflected
will
certainly
cost
too
much
said
he
then
yvonnot
who
was
short
and
slim
with
a
dark
face
and
mouth
added
monsieur
one
thing
that
troubles
us
is
that
this
water
will
lead
to
a
lot
more
disputes
among
us
when
we
divide
it
you
act
like
a
good
neighbour
in
giving
it
to
us
and
we
are
much
obliged
to
you
only
how
are
we
to
manage
so
that
each
may
have
his
proper
share
without
thinking
that
the
others
are
robbing
him
luc
smiled
the
question
pleased
him
for
it
would
enable
him
to
broach
the
subject
which
he
had
on
his
mind
and
on
account
of
which
he
had
so
particularly
desired
to
see
the
two
men
water
which
fertilises
said
he
to
belong
to
everybody
just
like
the
sun
which
shines
and
warms
and
the
land
too
which
brings
forth
and
nourishes
as
for
the
best
way
to
divide
the
water
why
the
best
is
not
to
divide
it
at
all
what
nature
gives
to
all
men
should
be
left
to
all
of
them
the
two
peasants
understood
his
meaning
for
a
moment
they
remained
silent
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
it
was
lenfant
the
greater
thinker
of
the
two
who
at
last
replied
yes
we
know
the
farmer
of
la
guerdache
spoke
to
us
of
all
that
no
doubt
it
a
good
idea
for
folk
to
come
to
an
agreement
as
you
have
done
here
and
put
their
money
and
land
and
arms
and
tools
in
common
and
then
share
the
profits
it
seems
certain
that
one
would
gain
more
and
be
happier
in
that
fashion
but
all
the
same
there
would
be
some
risk
in
it
and
i
think
that
one
will
have
to
talk
of
it
a
good
deal
longer
before
all
of
us
at
les
combettes
are
convinced
yes
that
certain
put
in
yvonnot
with
a
sudden
wave
of
his
arm
two
you
see
are
now
pretty
well
in
agreement
and
are
not
so
much
opposed
to
such
novelties
but
all
the
others
have
to
be
gained
over
and
that
will
take
a
lot
of
doing
i
warn
you
in
those
words
lurked
the
peasant
distrust
of
all
social
changes
affecting
the
conditions
under
which
property
is
now
held
luc
knew
it
well
he
had
expected
resistance
of
this
kind
however
he
continued
smiling
how
to
some
was
the
idea
of
having
to
give
up
one
strip
of
land
which
from
father
to
son
one
had
loved
for
centuries
and
to
see
it
merged
into
the
strips
of
others
nevertheless
all
the
many
bitter
disappointments
due
to
that
bankruptcy
of
the
soil
which
ended
by
filling
agriculturists
with
despair
and
disgust
must
help
to
convince
them
that
the
only
possible
salvation
lay
in
union
and
joint
effort
luc
explained
that
success
would
henceforth
belong
to
associations
that
it
was
necessary
to
operate
over
large
tracts
of
land
with
powerful
machines
for
ploughing
sowing
and
reaping
with
an
abundance
of
manure
too
chemically
prepared
in
neighbouring
factories
and
with
continuous
waterings
by
which
the
crops
would
be
greatly
increased
the
efforts
of
the
peasant
who
worked
alone
in
isolation
were
leading
to
famine
but
prodigious
plenty
would
ensue
if
the
peasants
of
a
village
would
only
combine
together
so
as
to
work
upon
a
large
scale
and
procure
the
necessary
machinery
manure
and
water
extraordinary
fertility
would
be
created
thereby
two
or
three
acres
would
suffice
to
feed
two
or
three
families
the
population
of
france
might
be
trebled
its
soil
would
amply
suffice
to
nourish
it
if
it
were
cultivated
logically
all
the
creative
forces
working
harmoniously
together
and
that
would
also
mean
happiness
the
peasants
labour
would
not
be
as
painful
as
now
he
would
be
liberated
from
all
sorts
of
ancient
servitude
that
of
the
moneylender
who
preys
upon
him
and
that
of
the
large
landowner
and
the
state
who
likewise
do
their
best
to
crush
him
it
too
fine
declared
lenfant
in
his
thoughtful
way
but
yvonnot
took
fire
more
readily
dash
it
said
he
that
be
true
we
should
be
fools
not
to
try
it
see
how
we
are
situated
at
la
crÃªcherie
resumed
luc
who
had
been
keeping
a
final
argument
in
reserve
have
hardly
been
three
years
in
existence
and
our
business
prospers
all
our
hands
who
have
combined
together
eat
meat
and
drink
wine
and
they
have
no
debts
left
and
no
fear
for
the
future
question
them
and
visit
our
workshops
our
homes
our
common
house
all
that
we
have
managed
to
create
in
so
short
a
time
it
all
the
fruit
of
union
and
you
yourselves
will
accomplish
prodigies
as
soon
as
you
become
united
yes
we
seen
we
know
the
two
peasants
answered
in
chorus
this
was
true
before
asking
for
luc
they
had
inquisitively
visited
la
crÃªcherie
appraising
the
wealth
already
acquired
feeling
amazed
at
the
sight
of
that
happy
town
which
was
springing
up
so
rapidly
and
wondering
what
gain
there
might
be
for
themselves
if
they
should
combine
in
the
same
manner
the
force
of
example
was
gradually
winning
them
over
since
you
know
it
all
simple
enough
luc
gaily
retorted
need
bread
our
men
ca
live
if
you
do
grow
the
corn
necessary
and
you
others
need
tools
spades
ploughs
machines
made
of
the
steel
which
we
manufacture
and
so
the
solution
of
the
problem
is
simple
enough
we
have
only
to
come
to
an
understanding
together
we
will
give
you
steel
you
will
give
us
corn
and
we
shall
all
live
very
happily
since
we
are
neighbours
since
your
land
adjoins
our
works
and
we
absolutely
have
need
of
one
another
is
it
not
best
to
live
as
brothers
to
combine
together
for
the
benefit
of
every
one
of
us
so
as
to
form
in
future
but
one
sole
family
luc
way
of
putting
the
proposal
made
lenfant
and
yvonnot
merry
never
had
the
desirability
of
reconciliation
and
agreement
between
the
peasant
and
the
industrial
worker
been
set
forth
more
plainly
luc
dreamt
indeed
of
incorporating
in
his
association
all
the
secondary
factories
and
industries
which
lived
on
it
or
beside
it
it
was
sufficient
that
there
should
be
a
centre
producing
a
raw
material
steel
for
other
manufactories
to
swarm
around
there
were
the
chodorge
works
which
made
nails
the
hausser
works
which
made
scythes
the
mirande
works
which
made
agricultural
machinery
and
there
was
even
an
old
one
hordoir
whose
couple
of
hammers
worked
by
water
power
derived
from
a
torrent
were
still
active
in
one
of
the
gorges
of
the
bleuse
mountains
all
of
these
if
they
desired
to
live
would
some
day
be
compelled
to
join
their
brothers
of
la
crÃªcherie
apart
from
whom
existence
would
prove
impossible
even
the
men
of
the
building
trades
and
those
of
the
clothing
trades
as
for
instance
mayor
gourier
would
be
dragged
into
the
combination
and
supply
houses
and
garments
and
shoes
even
if
in
exchange
they
desired
to
have
tools
and
bread
the
future
city
would
only
come
about
through
some
such
universal
agreement
a
community
of
labour
monsieur
luc
at
last
said
lenfant
in
his
wise
way
these
matters
are
too
big
to
be
decided
in
an
offhand
manner
but
we
promise
you
that
we
will
think
them
over
and
do
our
best
to
bring
about
a
cordial
agreement
at
les
combettes
such
as
you
have
here
is
just
it
monsieur
luc
said
yvonnot
seconding
his
companion
we
have
got
so
far
as
to
be
reconciled
lenfant
and
i
we
may
well
do
all
we
can
to
get
the
others
reconciled
in
the
same
way
feuillat
who
a
clever
fellow
will
help
us
then
before
going
off
they
once
more
referred
to
the
water
which
luc
had
promised
to
turn
into
the
rivulet
everything
was
settled
and
the
young
man
accompanied
them
as
far
as
the
garden
where
their
children
arsÃ¨ne
and
olympe
eugÃ©nie
and
nicolas
were
waiting
they
had
doubtless
brought
the
little
ones
in
order
to
show
them
that
famous
crÃªcherie
which
the
whole
region
was
talking
about
and
as
it
happened
the
pupils
of
the
five
classes
had
just
come
into
the
garden
to
play
so
that
it
was
full
of
turbulent
gaiety
the
skirts
of
the
girls
flew
about
in
the
bright
sunshine
the
boys
bounded
hither
and
thither
like
young
goats
there
was
laughter
and
singing
and
shouting
a
perfect
florescence
of
childish
happiness
amidst
the
grass
and
the
foliage
but
luc
caught
sight
of
sÅurette
who
stood
scolding
somebody
amidst
a
cluster
of
little
heads
both
fair
and
dark
in
the
front
rank
stood
nanet
now
nearly
ten
years
old
with
a
gay
round
bold
face
under
a
tumbled
shock
of
hair
of
the
hue
of
ripe
oats
but
suggesting
the
fleece
of
a
young
sheep
behind
him
were
grouped
other
children
from
five
to
ten
years
of
age
the
four
bonnaires
lucien
antoinette
zoÃ©
and
sÃ©verin
and
the
two
bourrons
sÃ©bastien
and
marthe
all
of
whom
no
doubt
had
been
detected
in
fault
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
nanet
had
been
the
leader
of
the
guilty
band
for
it
was
he
who
was
answering
sÅurette
arguing
matters
with
her
like
an
obstinate
urchin
who
would
never
admit
himself
to
be
in
the
wrong
is
the
matter
luc
inquired
it
nanet
sÅurette
replied
has
again
been
to
the
abyss
though
it
is
strictly
forbidden
i
have
just
learnt
that
he
led
these
others
there
yesterday
evening
and
this
time
they
even
climbed
over
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
crÃªcherie
lands
indeed
there
stood
a
separating
them
from
those
of
the
abyss
and
at
one
corner
where
delaveau
garden
was
situated
there
was
an
old
door
which
since
all
intercourse
had
ceased
was
kept
strongly
bolted
but
nanet
raised
his
voice
in
protest
of
all
said
he
is
true
that
we
all
got
over
the
wall
i
got
over
by
myself
and
then
i
opened
the
door
for
the
others
luc
who
felt
greatly
displeased
in
his
turn
lost
his
temper
know
very
well
he
exclaimed
you
have
been
told
more
than
a
dozen
times
that
you
are
not
to
go
there
you
will
end
by
bringing
on
us
some
serious
unpleasantness
and
i
repeat
it
to
all
of
you
that
it
is
very
wrong
and
wicked
to
disobey
in
this
fashion
nanet
stood
listening
and
looking
with
his
eyes
wide
open
a
good
little
fellow
at
bottom
but
unable
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
his
transgression
he
felt
moved
at
seeing
luc
so
disturbed
if
he
had
climbed
over
the
wall
to
let
the
others
in
it
was
because
nise
delaveau
had
some
playmates
with
her
that
afternoon
paul
boisgelin
louise
mazelle
and
other
amusing
little
and
because
they
all
wanted
to
play
together
she
was
very
pleasant
was
nise
delaveau
according
to
nanet
was
it
so
wrong
the
boy
repeated
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
did
do
harm
to
anybody
we
all
amused
ourselves
together
then
he
named
the
children
who
had
been
present
and
gave
a
truthful
account
of
what
they
had
done
they
had
only
played
as
was
allowable
they
had
not
broken
any
plants
nor
had
they
thrown
the
stones
lying
in
the
paths
on
to
the
gets
on
very
well
with
us
he
said
in
conclusion
likes
me
she
told
me
so
and
i
like
her
since
we
played
together
luc
forced
back
a
smile
but
in
his
heart
a
vision
was
arising
he
saw
the
children
of
the
two
rival
classes
scaling
walls
to
fraternise
and
play
and
laugh
together
in
spite
of
all
the
hatred
and
warfare
which
separated
their
fathers
would
the
peacefulness
of
the
future
community
flower
forth
in
them
is
quite
possible
said
he
nise
may
be
charming
and
that
you
may
agree
very
well
together
only
it
is
understood
that
she
is
to
remain
on
her
land
and
you
on
ours
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
complaints
then
sÅurette
won
over
by
all
the
charm
of
that
innocent
childhood
looked
at
him
with
eyes
so
suggestive
of
forgiveness
that
he
added
more
gently
you
must
not
do
it
again
little
ones
because
you
might
bring
some
real
worry
on
us
when
lenfant
and
yvonnot
had
finally
taken
leave
carrying
off
their
children
who
after
mingling
in
the
play
of
the
others
departed
very
regretfully
luc
whose
daily
visit
was
now
finished
thought
of
going
home
again
but
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
promised
to
see
josine
and
so
he
resolved
to
call
on
her
his
morning
had
hitherto
been
a
good
one
and
he
would
be
able
to
return
home
with
his
heart
full
of
hope
the
house
occupied
by
ragu
and
josine
one
of
the
first
that
had
been
built
stood
near
the
park
of
la
crÃªcherie
between
the
houses
occupied
by
the
bonnaires
and
the
bourrons
luc
was
crossing
the
road
when
at
some
distance
at
a
corner
of
the
foot
pavement
he
saw
a
small
group
of
women
who
appeared
to
be
busily
chattering
and
he
soon
recognised
madame
bonnaire
and
madame
bourron
who
were
apparently
giving
some
information
to
madame
fauchard
she
having
come
that
morning
like
her
husband
to
see
if
the
new
works
were
indeed
such
a
tom
ground
as
some
folk
asserted
judging
by
the
sharp
voice
and
harsh
gestures
of
madame
bonnaire
la
toupe
as
folks
called
her
it
seemed
evident
that
she
was
not
painting
a
very
seductive
picture
of
the
new
concern
as
she
was
she
could
be
happy
nowhere
but
invariably
spent
her
time
in
spoiling
her
own
life
and
that
of
others
at
the
very
beginning
she
had
seemed
pleased
to
find
her
husband
obtaining
work
at
la
crÃªcherie
but
after
dreaming
of
immediately
securing
a
big
share
of
the
profits
she
was
now
enraged
at
having
to
wait
for
it
perhaps
for
a
considerable
time
to
come
her
great
grievance
however
was
that
she
could
not
even
succeed
in
buying
herself
a
watch
an
article
of
which
she
had
coveted
the
possession
for
several
years
already
quite
a
contrast
to
her
was
babette
bourron
who
was
ever
in
a
state
of
delight
and
did
not
cease
extolling
the
advantages
of
her
new
home
her
keenest
satisfaction
arising
perhaps
from
the
fact
that
her
husband
no
longer
came
home
drunk
with
ragu
between
the
two
of
them
la
toupe
and
la
bourron
madame
fauchard
looking
more
emaciated
unlucky
and
mournful
than
ever
remained
in
a
state
of
some
perplexity
but
she
was
naturally
inclined
to
favour
the
pessimism
of
la
toupe
the
more
particularly
as
she
was
convinced
that
there
was
no
more
joy
for
her
in
this
life
the
sight
of
la
toupe
and
la
fauchard
thus
distressfully
chattering
was
very
disagreeable
to
luc
it
robbed
him
of
his
good
humour
the
more
especially
as
he
knew
what
a
disturbance
in
the
future
organisation
of
work
peace
and
justice
was
threatened
by
women
he
felt
that
they
were
and
it
was
by
and
for
them
that
he
would
have
liked
to
found
his
city
thus
his
courage
often
failed
him
when
he
met
such
as
were
evil
hostile
or
simply
indifferent
women
who
instead
of
proving
a
help
such
as
he
awaited
might
become
an
obstacle
a
destructive
force
indeed
by
which
his
labour
might
be
annihilated
however
he
passed
the
gossips
lifting
his
hat
as
he
did
so
and
they
suddenly
became
silent
and
anxious
as
if
he
had
caught
them
doing
wrong
when
he
entered
ragu
house
he
perceived
josine
seated
beside
a
window
she
had
been
sewing
but
her
work
had
fallen
in
her
lap
and
gazing
far
away
she
was
now
plunged
in
so
deep
a
reverie
that
she
did
not
even
hear
him
enter
for
a
moment
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
she
was
no
longer
the
wretched
girl
that
he
had
known
scouring
the
pavements
dying
of
starvation
badly
clad
with
a
pinched
and
woeful
face
under
a
wild
tangle
of
hair
she
was
now
and
looked
charming
in
her
simple
gown
of
blue
linen
stuff
her
figure
supple
and
slim
but
by
no
means
thin
and
her
beautiful
hair
light
as
silk
seemed
like
a
delicate
florescence
above
her
rather
long
face
with
its
laughing
blue
eyes
and
its
little
mouth
as
fresh
as
a
rosebud
she
seemed
also
to
be
seated
in
a
fitting
in
that
gay
and
clean
little
parlour
furnished
with
varnished
deal
the
room
that
she
most
preferred
in
the
little
house
which
she
had
entered
so
happily
and
in
tidying
and
embellishing
which
she
had
taken
so
much
pride
and
pleasure
for
three
years
past
but
of
what
could
josine
now
be
dreaming
with
so
sorrowful
an
expression
on
her
pale
face
when
bonnaire
had
prevailed
on
ragu
to
follow
him
and
join
the
others
at
la
crÃªcherie
she
had
deemed
herself
saved
from
all
future
trials
thenceforward
she
would
have
a
nice
little
home
her
daily
bread
would
be
assured
and
ragu
himself
having
no
further
worries
with
respect
to
work
would
amend
his
ways
luck
apparently
had
not
failed
her
ragu
had
even
married
her
at
the
express
desire
of
sÅurette
though
truth
to
tell
she
josine
was
by
no
means
so
pleased
with
the
idea
of
that
marriage
as
she
would
have
been
at
the
time
when
she
had
first
met
ragu
indeed
she
had
only
consented
to
it
after
consulting
luc
who
for
her
remained
both
god
and
master
and
deep
in
her
being
there
lurked
a
rapturous
feeling
born
of
the
momentary
hesitation
which
she
had
divined
in
him
before
he
signified
his
approval
but
after
all
was
not
that
the
best
and
indeed
the
only
possible
solution
she
could
not
do
otherwise
than
marry
ragu
since
he
was
willing
luc
had
to
appear
pleased
for
her
sake
retaining
for
her
the
same
affection
after
her
marriage
as
before
it
and
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
at
each
of
their
meetings
as
if
to
ask
her
whether
she
were
happy
but
at
those
times
she
often
felt
her
poor
heart
succumbing
to
despair
melting
with
an
unsatisfied
craving
for
true
affection
as
if
some
breath
had
warned
her
josine
started
and
shivered
slightly
amidst
her
dolorous
reverie
then
turning
round
she
recognised
luc
smiling
at
her
in
a
gentle
and
anxious
way
dear
child
said
he
come
because
ragu
asserts
that
you
are
very
badly
lodged
in
this
house
exposed
to
all
the
winds
from
the
plain
which
it
seems
have
broken
three
panes
of
your
bedroom
window
she
listened
looking
surprised
and
confused
at
a
loss
indeed
how
to
contradict
her
husband
and
avoid
telling
a
lie
there
are
some
panes
broken
monsieur
luc
said
she
not
sure
whether
it
was
the
wind
that
did
it
true
enough
when
it
blows
from
the
plain
we
get
our
full
share
of
it
her
voice
trembled
as
she
spoke
and
she
was
unable
to
restrain
two
big
tears
which
rolled
down
her
cheeks
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
windows
had
been
broken
by
ragu
the
previous
evening
when
in
a
fit
of
passion
he
had
wanted
to
throw
everything
out
of
doors
josine
are
you
crying
what
is
the
matter
come
tell
me
all
about
it
you
know
that
i
am
your
friend
said
luc
eagerly
he
had
seated
himself
beside
her
full
of
emotion
sharing
her
distress
but
she
had
already
wiped
her
tears
away
no
it
is
nothing
said
she
beg
your
pardon
but
you
come
at
a
bad
moment
and
found
me
unreasonable
and
worrying
struggle
as
she
might
however
he
at
last
wrung
a
full
confession
from
her
ragu
did
not
become
acclimatised
to
that
sphere
of
order
peacefulness
and
slow
and
continuous
effort
towards
a
better
life
he
seemed
to
suffer
from
nostalgia
to
regret
the
misery
and
the
suffering
of
that
amidst
which
he
had
lived
growling
against
the
masters
yet
habituated
to
slavery
and
consoling
himself
for
it
in
the
wine
shops
where
he
intoxicated
himself
and
poured
forth
rebellious
but
powerless
words
he
regretted
the
black
and
dirty
workshops
the
covert
warfare
waged
with
one
superiors
the
noisy
freaks
with
comrades
all
the
abominable
days
fraught
with
hatred
which
one
finished
up
by
beating
one
wife
and
children
when
one
at
last
returned
home
and
after
beginning
with
jests
he
was
ending
with
accusations
calling
la
crÃªcherie
a
big
barracks
a
prison
where
no
liberty
was
left
one
not
even
that
of
drinking
a
glass
too
many
if
one
felt
so
inclined
besides
so
far
one
earned
there
no
more
than
one
had
earned
at
the
abyss
and
there
were
all
sorts
of
worries
anxiety
as
to
whether
things
were
going
well
and
whether
there
might
be
no
money
for
one
to
take
when
the
time
came
round
for
for
instance
during
the
last
two
months
some
very
bad
rumours
had
been
spreading
it
was
said
that
they
would
all
have
to
tighten
their
waistbands
that
year
as
a
great
deal
of
money
had
been
expended
in
buying
new
machinery
then
again
the
stores
often
worked
very
badly
at
times
potatoes
were
sent
you
when
you
had
asked
for
paraffin
oil
or
else
you
were
forgotten
and
had
to
return
three
times
to
the
distribution
office
before
you
could
get
served
for
these
various
reasons
ragu
had
begun
to
deride
the
place
and
grow
wrathful
with
it
calling
it
a
dirty
hole
whence
he
hoped
to
his
hook
as
soon
as
might
be
possible
painful
silence
fell
between
josine
and
luc
the
young
man
had
become
gloomy
for
there
was
some
truth
beneath
all
those
recriminations
it
was
the
inevitable
grating
of
new
machinery
at
the
first
stage
of
its
work
the
rumours
which
were
afloat
respecting
the
difficulties
of
the
current
year
affected
luc
particularly
since
he
did
indeed
fear
that
he
might
be
obliged
to
ask
the
men
to
make
a
few
sacrifices
in
order
to
prevent
the
prosperity
of
the
establishment
from
being
compromised
bourron
says
ditto
to
ragu
does
he
not
luc
inquired
of
josine
you
have
never
heard
bonnaire
complain
have
you
josine
was
shaking
her
head
by
way
of
answering
no
when
through
the
open
window
the
breeze
wafted
the
voices
of
the
three
women
who
had
remained
on
the
la
toupe
was
again
forgetting
herself
carried
away
by
her
incessant
desire
to
bark
and
bite
if
bonnaire
remained
silent
like
a
thoughtful
man
whose
sensible
mind
admitted
the
necessity
of
an
experiment
of
considerable
duration
that
wife
of
his
sufficed
to
gather
together
all
the
backbiters
of
the
rising
town
as
luc
glanced
out
of
the
window
he
saw
her
again
frightening
la
fauchard
by
predicting
the
approaching
ruin
of
la
crÃªcherie
so
josine
he
slowly
resumed
are
not
happy
she
again
tried
to
protest
monsieur
luc
why
should
i
not
be
happy
when
you
have
done
so
much
for
me
but
her
strength
failed
her
and
again
two
big
tears
appeared
in
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
see
very
well
josine
you
are
not
happy
repeated
the
young
man
am
not
happy
it
true
monsieur
luc
she
at
last
answered
you
can
do
nothing
in
the
matter
it
is
no
fault
of
yours
you
have
been
a
providence
for
me
and
what
can
one
do
if
there
nothing
that
can
change
ragu
heart
he
is
becoming
quite
malicious
again
he
can
no
longer
abide
nanet
he
nearly
broke
everything
here
yesterday
evening
and
he
struck
me
because
the
child
so
he
said
answered
him
improperly
but
leave
me
monsieur
luc
those
are
things
which
only
concern
me
at
all
events
i
promise
you
that
i
worry
as
little
as
i
can
sobs
broke
upon
her
trembling
voice
which
was
scarcely
audible
and
he
powerless
as
he
was
experienced
increasing
sadness
a
shadow
was
cast
over
the
whole
of
his
happy
morning
he
was
chilled
by
doubt
and
despair
he
usually
so
brave
whose
strength
lay
so
much
in
joyous
hope
although
things
obeyed
him
although
material
success
seemed
assured
was
he
to
find
himself
powerless
to
change
men
and
develop
divine
love
the
fruitful
flower
of
kindliness
and
solidarity
in
their
hearts
if
men
should
remain
in
a
state
of
hatred
and
violence
his
work
would
never
be
accomplished
yet
how
was
he
to
awaken
them
to
affection
how
was
he
to
teach
them
happiness
that
dear
josine
whom
he
had
sought
in
the
very
depths
whom
he
had
saved
from
such
awful
misery
she
to
him
seemed
the
very
image
of
his
work
that
work
would
not
really
exist
until
she
was
happy
she
was
woman
wretched
woman
the
slave
the
beast
of
burden
and
the
toy
that
he
had
dreamt
of
saving
and
if
she
was
still
and
ever
unhappy
nothing
substantial
could
have
been
founded
everything
still
remained
to
be
done
amidst
his
grief
luc
foresaw
many
dolorous
days
a
keen
perception
came
to
him
of
the
fact
that
a
terrible
struggle
was
about
to
open
between
the
past
and
the
future
and
that
he
himself
would
shed
in
it
both
tears
and
blood
not
cry
josine
said
he
brave
and
i
promise
you
that
you
shall
be
happy
for
you
must
be
happy
in
order
that
everybody
may
be
so
he
spoke
so
gently
that
she
smiled
i
am
brave
monsieur
luc
she
answered
know
very
well
that
you
wo
forsake
me
and
that
you
will
end
by
conquering
since
you
are
so
full
of
kindness
and
courage
i
will
wait
i
promise
you
even
if
i
have
to
wait
all
my
life
it
was
like
an
engagement
an
exchange
of
promises
instinct
with
hope
in
coming
happiness
luc
rose
and
as
he
stood
there
clasping
both
her
hands
he
could
feel
the
pressure
of
her
own
and
that
was
the
only
token
of
affection
between
them
the
union
of
their
hands
for
a
few
brief
seconds
ah
what
a
simple
life
of
peacefulness
and
joy
might
have
been
lived
in
that
little
parlour
so
cheerful
and
so
clean
with
its
furniture
of
varnished
deal
josine
monsieur
luc
then
luc
turned
his
steps
homeward
and
he
was
following
the
terrace
below
which
ran
the
road
to
les
combettes
when
a
final
encounter
made
him
pause
for
a
moment
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
who
in
his
propelled
by
a
was
skirting
the
crÃªcherie
lands
the
sight
of
the
old
man
recalled
to
luc
other
frequent
chance
meetings
with
him
now
here
now
there
and
particularly
the
first
meeting
of
all
when
he
had
seen
him
passing
the
abyss
and
gazing
with
his
clear
eyes
at
the
smoky
and
noisy
pile
where
he
had
formerly
founded
the
fortune
of
the
qurignons
in
like
fashion
he
was
now
passing
la
crÃªcherie
and
gazing
at
its
new
buildings
so
gay
in
the
sunlight
with
those
same
clear
and
seemingly
empty
eyes
of
his
why
had
he
signed
to
his
servant
to
bring
him
so
far
was
he
making
a
complete
round
of
the
place
in
order
to
examine
everything
what
did
he
think
of
it
then
what
comparisons
did
he
wish
to
establish
perhaps
after
all
this
was
merely
some
chance
promenade
some
mere
caprice
on
the
part
of
a
poor
old
man
who
had
lapsed
into
second
childhood
however
whilst
the
servant
slackened
his
pace
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
grave
and
impassive
raised
his
broad
and
regular
countenance
on
either
side
of
which
fell
his
long
white
hair
and
seemingly
scrutinised
everything
letting
neither
a
wall
nor
a
chimney
pass
without
giving
it
a
glance
as
if
indeed
he
wished
to
thoroughly
understand
that
new
town
now
springing
up
beside
the
establishment
which
he
had
formerly
created
but
a
fresh
incident
occurred
and
luc
emotion
increased
another
old
man
also
infirm
but
still
able
to
drag
himself
about
on
his
swollen
legs
was
coming
slowly
along
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
it
was
daddy
lunot
corpulent
pale
and
flabby
whom
the
bonnaires
had
kept
with
them
and
who
in
sunny
weather
took
short
walks
past
the
works
at
first
no
doubt
he
failed
to
recognise
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
for
his
sight
was
weak
then
however
he
started
and
drew
back
close
to
the
wall
as
if
the
road
were
not
wide
enough
for
two
and
raising
his
straw
hat
he
bent
double
bowed
profoundly
it
was
to
the
qurignons
ancestor
to
the
master
and
founder
that
the
eldest
of
the
ragus
and
father
of
thus
rendered
homage
years
and
behind
him
centuries
of
toil
suffering
and
poverty
humbled
themselves
in
that
trembling
salute
the
master
might
be
stricken
but
the
former
slave
in
whose
blood
coursed
the
cowardice
of
ancient
servitude
became
disturbed
and
bowed
as
he
passed
and
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
did
not
even
see
him
but
passed
on
staring
like
a
stupefied
idol
his
gaze
still
and
ever
fixed
on
the
new
workshops
of
la
crÃªcherie
which
perhaps
he
likewise
failed
to
see
luc
shuddered
what
a
past
there
was
to
be
destroyed
what
evil
deadly
tares
there
were
to
pluck
away
he
looked
at
his
town
scarce
rising
from
the
ground
and
understood
what
trouble
what
obstacles
it
would
encounter
in
growing
and
prospering
love
alone
and
woman
and
child
could
end
by
achieving
victory
ii
during
the
four
years
that
la
crÃªcherie
had
been
established
covert
hatred
of
luc
had
been
rising
from
beauclair
at
first
there
had
only
been
so
much
hostile
astonishment
accompanied
by
malicious
pleasantries
but
since
folk
had
been
affected
in
their
interests
anger
had
arisen
with
a
furious
desire
to
resist
that
public
enemy
by
all
possible
weapons
it
was
more
particularly
among
the
petty
traders
the
retail
shopkeepers
that
anxiety
at
first
displayed
itself
the
stores
of
la
crÃªcherie
which
had
been
regarded
with
derision
when
first
inaugurated
were
now
proving
successful
counting
among
their
customers
not
only
the
factory
hands
but
also
all
the
inhabitants
who
adhered
to
them
as
may
be
imagined
the
old
purveyors
were
thrown
into
great
emotion
by
that
terrible
competition
that
new
tariff
which
in
many
instances
meant
a
reduction
of
one
third
on
former
prices
ruin
would
soon
ensue
if
that
wretched
luc
were
to
prevail
with
those
disastrous
ideas
of
his
tending
to
a
more
just
apportionment
of
wealth
and
aiming
in
the
first
instance
at
enabling
the
humble
ones
of
the
world
to
live
more
comfortably
and
cheaply
the
butchers
the
grocers
the
bakers
the
wine
dealers
would
all
have
to
put
up
their
shutters
if
people
were
to
succeed
in
doing
without
them
thus
the
tradespeople
shouted
in
chorus
that
it
was
abominable
to
them
society
did
indeed
seem
to
be
cracking
and
collapsing
now
that
they
could
no
longer
levy
the
profits
of
parasites
and
thereby
increase
the
misery
of
the
poor
the
most
affected
of
all
however
were
the
laboques
those
ironmongers
who
after
beginning
life
as
market
hawkers
had
ended
by
establishing
something
like
a
huge
bazaar
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
brias
and
the
place
de
la
mairie
the
prices
for
the
iron
of
commerce
had
fallen
considerably
throughout
the
district
since
la
crÃªcherie
had
been
turning
out
large
quantities
and
the
worst
was
that
with
the
movement
now
gaining
upon
the
smaller
works
of
the
neighbourhood
a
time
seemed
coming
when
consumers
would
procure
direct
at
the
stores
without
passing
through
the
clutches
of
the
laboques
such
articles
as
chodorge
nails
hausser
scythes
and
sickles
and
mirande
agricultural
appliances
and
tools
apart
from
their
output
of
raw
iron
and
steel
the
crÃªcherie
stores
were
already
supplying
several
of
those
articles
and
thus
the
amount
of
business
transacted
by
the
laboques
became
smaller
every
day
their
rage
therefore
knew
no
end
they
were
exasperated
by
what
they
termed
that
of
prices
and
regarded
themselves
as
robbed
simply
because
their
useless
cogwheels
were
no
longer
being
allowed
to
consume
energy
and
wealth
with
profit
for
nobody
save
themselves
their
house
had
thus
naturally
become
a
centre
of
hostility
opposition
and
hatred
in
which
luc
name
was
never
mentioned
otherwise
than
with
execration
there
met
dacheux
the
butcher
stammering
forth
his
reactionary
rage
and
caffiaux
the
grocer
and
who
although
reeking
of
rancour
was
of
a
colder
temperament
and
weighed
his
own
interests
carefully
even
the
beautiful
madame
mitaine
the
baker
wife
though
inclined
to
agreement
came
at
times
and
lamented
with
the
others
the
loss
of
a
few
of
her
customers
you
know
laboque
cried
this
monsieur
luc
as
people
call
him
has
at
bottom
only
one
idea
that
of
destroying
trade
yes
he
boasts
of
it
he
shouts
the
monstrous
words
aloud
trade
is
robbery
for
him
we
are
all
robbers
and
we
got
to
disappear
it
was
to
sweep
us
away
that
he
established
la
crÃªcherie
dacheux
listened
with
dilated
eyes
and
all
his
blood
rushing
to
his
face
how
will
one
manage
to
eat
and
clothe
oneself
and
all
the
rest
he
asked
he
says
that
the
consumer
will
apply
direct
to
the
producer
the
money
the
butcher
asked
why
he
suppresses
that
too
there
to
be
no
more
money
it
stupid
eh
as
if
people
could
live
without
money
at
this
dacheux
almost
choked
with
fury
more
trade
no
more
money
why
he
wants
to
destroy
everything
is
there
a
prison
for
such
a
bandit
he
ruin
beauclair
if
we
do
put
a
stop
to
it
but
caffiaux
was
gravely
wagging
his
head
says
a
good
many
more
things
he
says
first
of
all
that
everybody
ought
to
work
he
wants
to
turn
the
world
into
a
perfect
where
there
be
guards
with
staves
to
see
that
everybody
does
his
task
he
says
too
that
there
ought
to
be
neither
rich
nor
poor
according
to
him
one
will
be
no
richer
when
one
born
than
when
one
dies
one
will
eat
according
to
what
one
earns
neither
more
nor
less
too
than
one
neighbour
and
one
wo
even
have
the
right
to
save
up
money
but
what
about
inheritances
put
in
dacheux
will
be
no
more
inheritances
no
more
inheritances
i
sha
be
able
to
leave
my
daughter
my
own
money
thunder
that
is
coming
it
too
strong
and
thereupon
the
butcher
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
with
such
violence
that
it
shook
says
too
continued
caffiaux
there
will
be
no
more
authorities
of
any
kind
no
government
no
gendarmes
no
judges
no
prisons
each
will
live
as
he
pleases
eat
and
sleep
as
he
fancies
he
says
also
that
machinery
will
end
by
doing
all
the
work
and
that
the
workmen
will
simply
have
to
drive
it
it
is
to
be
the
earthly
paradise
because
there
will
be
no
more
fighting
no
more
armies
and
no
more
wars
and
he
says
moreover
that
when
men
and
women
love
one
another
they
will
remain
together
as
long
as
they
please
and
then
bid
each
other
in
a
friendly
fashion
to
take
up
with
others
later
on
if
they
are
so
inclined
and
as
for
children
the
community
will
take
charge
of
them
bring
them
up
in
a
heap
as
chance
may
have
it
without
any
need
of
a
mother
or
a
father
attentions
beautiful
madame
mitaine
who
hitherto
had
remained
silent
now
began
to
protest
the
poor
little
ones
said
she
hope
that
each
mother
will
at
least
have
the
right
to
bring
up
her
own
it
all
very
well
for
the
children
who
are
forsaken
by
their
parents
to
be
brought
up
by
strangers
as
in
orphan
asylums
but
really
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
have
been
telling
us
is
hardly
proper
at
once
that
it
filthy
roared
dacheux
who
was
beside
himself
their
famous
future
society
will
simply
be
a
house
of
then
laboque
who
did
not
lose
sight
of
his
threatened
interests
concluded
monsieur
luc
is
mad
we
can
not
let
him
ruin
and
dishonour
beauclair
in
this
fashion
we
shall
have
to
agree
together
and
take
steps
to
stop
it
all
the
anger
increased
however
and
there
was
a
universal
explosion
when
beauclair
learnt
that
the
infectious
disease
of
la
crÃªcherie
was
spreading
to
the
neighbouring
village
of
les
combettes
stupefaction
was
manifested
condemnation
was
passed
on
all
sides
that
monsieur
luc
was
now
debauching
poisoning
the
peasantry
after
reconciling
the
four
hundred
inhabitants
of
the
village
lenfant
the
mayor
assisted
by
his
deputy
yvonnot
had
induced
them
to
put
their
land
in
common
by
virtue
of
a
deed
of
association
similar
to
that
which
linked
capital
talent
and
work
together
at
la
crÃªcherie
henceforth
there
would
be
but
one
large
estate
in
such
wise
that
machinery
might
be
used
that
manure
might
be
applied
on
a
large
scale
and
high
cultivation
practised
with
a
view
to
increasing
the
crops
tenfold
and
reaping
large
profits
which
would
be
shared
by
one
and
all
moreover
the
two
associations
that
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
that
of
les
combettes
would
mutually
consolidate
each
other
the
peasants
would
supply
the
workmen
with
bread
and
the
workmen
would
supply
the
peasants
with
tools
and
manufactured
articles
necessary
for
life
in
such
a
way
that
there
would
be
a
conjunction
of
two
inimical
classes
tending
by
degrees
to
fusion
and
forming
the
embryo
of
a
brotherly
people
assuredly
the
old
world
would
come
to
an
end
if
socialism
should
win
over
the
peasantry
the
innumerable
toilers
of
the
country
districts
who
had
hitherto
been
regarded
as
the
ramparts
of
egotistical
ownership
preferring
to
die
of
unremunerative
labour
on
their
strips
of
land
rather
than
part
with
them
the
shock
of
this
change
was
felt
throughout
beauclair
and
a
shudder
passed
like
a
warning
of
the
coming
catastrophe
again
the
laboques
were
the
first
to
be
affected
they
lost
the
custom
of
les
combettes
they
no
longer
saw
lenfant
nor
any
of
the
others
come
to
buy
spades
ploughs
tools
and
utensils
on
the
last
occasion
when
lenfant
called
he
haggled
and
finally
bought
nothing
plainly
declaring
to
them
that
he
would
gain
thirty
per
cent
by
no
longer
dealing
with
them
since
they
were
compelled
to
levy
such
a
profit
on
articles
which
they
themselves
procured
at
neighbouring
works
henceforth
all
the
folk
of
les
combettes
addressed
themselves
direct
to
la
crÃªcherie
adhering
to
the
stores
there
which
grew
and
grew
in
importance
and
then
terror
set
in
among
all
the
petty
retailers
of
beauclair
must
act
one
must
act
laboque
repeated
with
growing
violence
each
time
that
dacheux
and
caffiaux
came
to
see
him
we
wait
till
that
madman
has
infected
the
whole
region
with
his
monstrous
doctrines
we
shall
be
too
late
what
can
be
done
caffiaux
prudently
inquired
dacheux
for
his
part
favoured
brutal
slaughter
might
wait
for
him
one
evening
at
a
street
corner
and
treat
him
to
one
of
those
hidings
which
give
a
man
food
for
reflection
but
laboque
puny
and
cunning
dreamt
of
some
safer
means
of
killing
his
man
no
the
whole
town
is
rising
against
him
and
we
must
wait
for
an
opportunity
when
we
shall
have
the
whole
town
on
our
side
such
an
opportunity
did
indeed
arise
for
centuries
past
old
beauclair
had
been
traversed
by
a
filthy
rivulet
a
kind
of
open
drain
which
was
called
the
clouque
it
was
not
known
whence
it
came
it
seemed
to
flow
up
from
under
some
antique
hovels
at
the
opening
of
the
brias
gorges
and
according
to
the
common
opinion
it
was
one
of
those
mountain
torrents
whose
sources
remain
unknown
some
very
old
inhabitants
remembered
having
seen
it
in
full
flood
at
certain
periods
but
for
long
years
already
it
had
supplied
very
little
water
which
various
industries
contaminated
the
housewives
dwelling
beside
it
had
even
ended
by
using
it
as
a
natural
sink
into
which
they
emptied
all
sorts
of
slops
in
such
wise
that
it
carried
with
it
much
of
the
filth
of
the
poor
district
and
in
summer
sent
forth
an
abominable
stench
at
one
moment
there
had
been
serious
fears
of
an
epidemic
and
the
municipal
council
at
the
mayor
initiative
had
debated
whether
it
should
not
be
covered
over
but
the
expense
seemed
too
great
so
the
matter
was
shelved
and
the
clouque
quietly
continued
perfuming
and
contaminating
the
neighbourhood
all
at
once
however
it
quite
ceased
to
flow
dried
up
apparently
leaving
only
a
hard
rocky
bed
in
which
there
was
no
longer
a
single
drop
of
water
as
by
the
touch
of
some
magician
wand
beauclair
was
rid
of
that
source
of
infection
to
which
all
the
bad
fevers
of
the
district
had
been
attributed
and
all
that
remained
was
a
feeling
of
curiosity
as
to
whither
the
torrent
might
have
betaken
itself
at
first
there
were
only
some
vague
rumours
on
the
subject
then
more
precise
statements
were
made
and
it
became
certain
that
it
was
monsieur
luc
who
had
begun
to
divert
the
torrent
from
its
usual
course
by
capturing
the
springs
on
the
slopes
of
the
bleuse
mountains
for
the
needs
of
la
crÃªcherie
whose
health
and
prosperity
came
largely
from
its
abundant
supply
of
beautiful
clear
water
but
the
climax
had
come
all
the
water
of
the
torrent
being
diverted
by
luc
when
it
had
occurred
to
him
to
give
the
overplus
of
his
reservoirs
to
the
peasants
of
les
combettes
in
that
way
founding
their
fortune
and
bringing
about
their
happy
association
for
it
was
that
beneficent
water
flowing
on
for
one
and
all
that
had
first
united
them
together
before
long
proofs
became
plentiful
the
water
which
had
disappeared
from
the
clouque
was
streaming
along
the
and
turned
to
intelligent
use
was
becoming
wealth
instead
of
filth
and
death
then
rancour
and
rage
arose
and
grew
against
that
man
luc
who
disposed
so
lightly
of
what
did
not
belong
to
him
why
had
he
stolen
the
torrent
why
did
he
keep
it
and
give
it
to
his
creatures
it
was
not
right
that
people
should
in
that
way
take
the
water
of
a
town
a
stream
which
had
always
flowed
there
which
people
were
accustomed
to
see
and
which
whatever
might
be
said
to
the
contrary
had
rendered
great
services
the
meagre
streamlet
transporting
filthy
detritus
exhaling
pestilence
and
killing
people
was
forgotten
folk
talked
no
more
of
burying
it
each
recounted
what
great
benefit
he
or
she
had
derived
from
it
for
watering
for
washing
and
for
the
daily
needs
of
life
such
a
theft
could
not
be
tolerated
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
la
crÃªcherie
should
restore
the
clouque
that
filthy
drain
which
had
poisoned
the
town
naturally
enough
it
was
laboque
who
shouted
the
loudest
he
paid
an
official
visit
to
gourier
the
mayor
to
inquire
what
decision
he
intended
to
propose
to
the
municipal
council
under
such
grave
circumstances
he
laboque
claimed
to
be
particularly
injured
for
the
clouque
had
flowed
behind
his
house
at
the
end
of
his
little
garden
and
he
alleged
that
he
had
derived
considerable
advantages
therefrom
if
he
had
drawn
up
a
protest
and
sought
to
collect
signatures
he
would
undoubtedly
have
obtained
those
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
his
district
but
in
his
opinion
the
town
itself
ought
to
take
the
affair
in
hand
and
commence
an
action
against
la
crÃªcherie
claiming
the
restitution
of
the
torrent
and
damages
for
the
temporary
loss
of
it
gourier
listened
and
in
spite
of
his
own
hatred
against
luc
contented
himself
with
nodding
approval
finally
he
declared
that
he
must
have
a
few
days
to
reflect
look
into
the
matter
and
consult
those
around
him
he
fully
understood
that
laboque
was
urging
the
town
to
take
up
the
matter
in
order
that
he
might
not
have
to
do
so
himself
and
no
doubt
chÃ¢telard
whom
all
complications
terrified
and
with
whom
gourier
shut
himself
up
for
a
couple
of
hours
was
able
to
convince
him
that
it
was
always
wise
to
let
others
embark
in
for
when
the
mayor
sent
for
the
ironmonger
again
it
was
only
to
explain
to
him
at
great
length
that
an
action
started
by
the
town
would
drag
on
and
lead
to
nothing
serious
whereas
one
brought
by
a
private
individual
would
prove
far
more
disastrous
for
la
crÃªcherie
particularly
if
after
a
first
condemnation
other
private
individuals
followed
suit
prolonging
matters
indefinitely
a
few
days
later
laboque
issued
a
writ
and
claimed
five
and
twenty
thousand
francs
damages
taking
as
a
pretext
a
kind
of
treat
offered
by
his
son
and
daughter
auguste
and
eulalie
to
their
young
friends
honorine
caffiaux
Ã©variste
mitaine
and
julienne
dacheux
laboque
held
quite
a
meeting
at
his
house
the
young
folk
were
now
fast
growing
up
auguste
was
sixteen
and
eulalie
nine
Ã©variste
now
in
his
fourteenth
year
was
already
becoming
serious
and
honorine
nineteen
and
thus
of
an
age
to
marry
showed
herself
quite
motherly
towards
little
julienne
who
was
but
eight
years
old
and
therefore
the
youngest
of
the
party
the
young
people
it
should
be
said
at
once
installed
themselves
in
the
strip
of
garden
where
they
played
and
laughed
merrily
for
their
consciences
were
clear
and
gay
and
they
knew
nothing
of
hatred
and
anger
such
as
consumed
their
parents
hold
him
at
last
said
laboque
to
his
friends
gourier
told
me
that
if
we
carried
things
to
a
finish
we
should
ruin
the
works
let
us
admit
that
the
court
only
awards
me
ten
thousand
francs
well
there
are
a
hundred
of
you
who
can
all
bring
similar
actions
so
he
would
have
to
dip
in
his
pockets
for
a
million
and
that
is
not
all
he
will
have
to
give
us
back
the
torrent
and
demolish
the
works
he
raised
that
will
deprive
him
of
that
fine
fresh
water
which
he
is
so
proud
of
ah
my
friends
what
a
good
business
they
all
grew
excited
and
triumphant
at
the
idea
of
ruining
the
works
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
lowering
that
fellow
luc
that
madman
who
wished
to
destroy
trade
inheritances
money
in
a
word
all
the
most
venerable
foundations
of
human
society
caffiaux
alone
reflected
should
have
preferred
to
see
an
action
brought
by
the
town
said
he
it
a
question
of
fighting
the
gentlefolk
always
want
others
to
do
so
where
are
the
hundred
people
who
will
issue
writs
against
la
crÃªcherie
at
this
dacheux
exploded
i
would
willingly
join
in
if
my
house
were
not
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
even
as
things
stand
i
shall
see
if
i
can
not
do
something
for
the
clouque
passes
at
the
end
of
my
yard
yes
thunder
i
must
make
one
of
you
to
begin
resumed
laboque
is
madame
mitaine
who
is
circumstanced
exactly
as
i
am
and
whose
house
suffers
like
mine
since
the
stream
has
ceased
to
flow
you
will
issue
a
writ
wo
you
madame
mitaine
he
had
craftily
invited
her
that
day
with
the
express
intention
of
compelling
her
to
enter
into
a
formal
agreement
he
knew
her
to
be
desirous
of
living
in
peace
herself
and
of
respecting
the
peace
of
others
nevertheless
he
hoped
to
win
her
over
she
at
first
began
to
laugh
as
for
any
harm
done
to
my
house
by
the
disappearance
of
the
clouque
no
no
neighbour
the
truth
is
that
i
had
given
orders
that
not
a
drop
of
that
bad
water
was
ever
to
be
used
for
i
feared
i
might
render
my
customers
ill
it
was
so
dirty
and
it
smelt
so
bad
that
whenever
it
is
given
back
to
us
we
shall
have
to
spend
the
necessary
money
to
get
rid
of
it
by
making
it
pass
underground
as
there
was
formerly
a
question
of
doing
laboque
pretended
that
he
did
not
hear
this
all
events
madame
mitaine
said
he
are
with
us
your
interests
are
the
same
as
ours
and
if
i
win
my
suit
you
will
act
with
all
the
other
people
relying
on
the
wo
you
see
we
see
replied
the
baker
beautiful
wife
becoming
grave
willing
enough
to
be
on
the
side
of
justice
if
it
is
just
laboque
had
to
rest
content
with
that
conditional
promise
besides
his
state
of
excitement
and
rancour
deprived
him
of
all
sense
he
thought
that
victory
was
already
won
and
that
he
was
about
to
crush
all
those
socialist
follies
which
in
four
years
had
diminished
his
sales
by
one
half
it
was
society
that
he
avenged
by
banging
his
fist
on
the
table
in
company
with
dacheux
whilst
the
prudent
caffiaux
before
definitely
committing
himself
waited
to
see
which
side
would
triumph
beauclair
was
quite
upset
when
it
heard
of
laboque
writ
and
his
demand
for
an
indemnity
of
thousand
francs
this
was
indeed
an
ultimatum
a
declaration
of
war
from
that
moment
there
was
a
around
which
all
the
scattered
hatreds
grouped
themselves
into
an
army
which
pronounced
itself
vigorously
against
luc
and
his
work
that
diabolical
factory
where
the
ruin
of
ancient
and
respectable
society
was
being
forged
all
beauclair
ended
by
belonging
to
this
army
the
injured
tradesmen
drew
their
customers
together
and
all
the
gentlefolk
joined
since
the
new
ideas
quite
terrified
them
indeed
there
was
not
a
petty
who
did
not
feel
himself
threatened
by
some
frightful
cataclysm
in
which
his
own
narrow
egotistical
life
would
collapse
the
women
too
were
indignant
and
disgusted
now
that
la
crÃªcherie
was
depicted
to
them
as
a
huge
disorderly
house
the
triumph
of
which
with
its
doctrine
of
free
love
would
place
them
at
any
man
mercy
even
the
workmen
even
the
starving
poor
became
anxious
and
began
to
curse
the
man
who
dreamt
of
saving
them
but
whom
they
accused
of
aggravating
their
misery
by
increasing
the
pitilessness
of
their
employers
and
the
wealthy
what
distracted
beauclair
more
than
all
else
however
was
a
violent
campaign
which
the
local
newspaper
the
little
sheet
published
by
lebleu
the
printer
started
against
luc
this
journal
now
appeared
twice
a
week
and
captain
jollivet
was
suspected
of
being
the
author
of
the
articles
whose
virulence
was
creating
such
a
sensation
the
attack
it
should
be
said
reduced
itself
to
a
cannonade
of
lies
and
errors
all
the
muddy
trash
which
is
cast
at
socialism
by
way
of
caricaturing
its
intentions
and
besmirching
its
ideal
it
was
however
certain
that
such
tactics
would
prove
successful
with
poor
ignorant
brains
and
it
was
curious
to
see
how
greatly
the
indignation
spread
uniting
against
the
disturber
of
the
public
peace
all
the
old
inimical
classes
which
were
furious
at
being
disturbed
in
their
ancient
cesspool
by
a
pretended
desire
to
reconcile
them
and
lead
them
to
the
just
happy
and
healthy
city
of
the
future
two
days
before
laboque
action
was
heard
in
the
civil
court
of
beauclair
the
delaveaus
gave
a
grand
lunch
with
the
secret
object
of
enabling
their
friends
to
meet
and
arrive
at
an
agreement
prior
to
the
battle
the
boisgelins
naturally
were
invited
and
so
were
mayor
gourier
chÃ¢telard
judge
gaume
with
his
captain
jollivet
and
finally
abbÃ©
marle
the
ladies
of
the
various
families
also
attended
in
order
that
the
meeting
might
retain
all
the
semblance
of
a
private
pleasure
party
chÃ¢telard
that
day
according
to
his
wont
called
on
the
mayor
at
eleven
to
fetch
him
and
his
wife
the
lÃ©onore
ever
since
the
success
of
la
crÃªcherie
gourier
had
been
living
in
anxiety
he
had
divined
that
a
quiver
was
passing
through
the
hundreds
of
hands
that
he
employed
at
his
large
in
the
rue
de
brias
the
men
were
evidently
influenced
by
the
new
ideas
and
inclined
to
combine
together
and
he
asked
himself
if
it
would
not
be
better
to
yield
to
help
on
such
combination
himself
for
he
would
be
ruined
by
it
if
he
did
not
contrive
to
belong
to
it
this
however
was
a
worry
which
he
kept
secret
for
there
was
another
which
filled
him
with
great
rancour
and
made
him
luc
personal
enemy
his
son
indeed
that
tall
young
fellow
achille
so
independent
in
his
ways
had
broken
off
all
connection
with
his
parents
and
sought
employment
at
la
crÃªcherie
where
he
found
himself
near
his
sweetheart
of
the
starry
nights
gourier
had
forbidden
any
mention
of
that
ungrateful
son
who
had
deserted
the
to
join
the
enemies
of
social
security
but
although
the
mayor
was
unwilling
to
say
it
his
son
departure
had
aggravated
his
secret
uncertainty
and
brought
him
a
covert
fear
that
he
might
some
day
be
forced
to
imitate
the
youth
example
said
he
to
chÃ¢telard
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
latter
enter
lawsuit
is
at
hand
now
laboque
has
been
to
see
me
again
as
he
wanted
some
certificates
he
is
still
of
opinion
that
the
town
ought
to
intervene
and
it
is
really
difficult
to
refuse
him
a
helping
hand
after
egging
him
on
as
we
did
the
contented
himself
with
smiling
no
my
friend
he
answered
me
do
involve
the
town
in
it
you
were
sensible
enough
to
yield
to
my
reasoning
you
refused
to
take
proceedings
and
you
allowed
that
terrible
laboque
who
thirsts
for
vengeance
and
massacre
to
act
by
himself
that
was
fitting
and
i
beg
you
persevere
in
that
course
remain
simply
a
spectator
there
will
always
be
time
to
profit
by
laboque
victory
if
he
should
be
victorious
ah
my
friend
if
you
only
knew
what
advantages
one
derives
by
meddling
in
nothing
then
by
a
gesture
he
expressed
all
that
he
had
in
his
mind
the
peace
that
he
enjoyed
in
that
of
his
since
he
allowed
himself
to
be
forgotten
there
things
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
in
paris
the
central
authorities
were
collapsing
a
little
more
each
day
and
the
time
was
near
when
society
would
either
crumble
to
pieces
or
be
swept
away
by
a
revolution
he
like
a
sceptical
philosopher
only
asked
that
he
might
endure
till
then
and
finish
his
life
happily
in
the
warm
little
nest
which
he
had
chosen
his
whole
policy
therefore
consisted
in
letting
things
go
in
meddling
with
them
as
little
as
possible
and
he
was
convinced
that
the
government
amidst
the
difficulties
of
its
last
days
was
extremely
grateful
to
him
for
abandoning
the
beast
to
its
death
without
creating
any
further
worries
a
whom
one
never
heard
of
who
by
his
intelligence
had
effaced
beauclair
from
the
number
of
governmental
cares
was
indeed
a
precious
functionary
thus
chÃ¢telard
got
on
extremely
well
his
superiors
only
remembered
him
to
cover
him
with
praises
whilst
he
quietly
finished
burying
the
old
social
system
spending
the
autumn
of
his
own
days
at
the
feet
of
the
beautiful
lÃ©onore
hear
my
friend
he
continued
compromise
yourself
for
in
such
times
as
ours
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
on
the
morrow
one
must
be
prepared
for
everything
and
the
best
course
therefore
is
to
include
oneself
with
nothing
let
the
others
run
on
ahead
and
take
all
the
risk
of
getting
their
bones
broken
you
will
see
very
well
afterwards
what
you
ought
to
do
however
lÃ©onore
now
came
into
the
room
gowned
in
light
silk
since
she
had
passed
her
fortieth
year
she
had
been
looking
younger
than
ever
with
her
blonde
majestic
beauty
and
her
candid
eyes
chÃ¢telard
as
gallant
now
as
on
the
very
first
day
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
whilst
the
husband
with
an
air
of
relief
glanced
at
the
pair
affectionately
you
are
ready
said
he
will
start
then
eh
chÃ¢telard
and
be
easy
i
am
prudent
and
have
no
desire
to
thrust
myself
into
any
turmoil
which
would
destroy
our
peace
and
quietness
but
at
delaveau
you
know
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
like
the
others
at
that
same
hour
judge
gaume
was
waiting
at
home
for
his
daughter
lucile
and
his
jollivet
who
were
to
fetch
him
in
order
that
they
might
all
repair
to
the
lunch
together
during
the
last
four
years
the
judge
had
greatly
aged
he
seemed
to
have
become
yet
more
severe
and
sadder
and
he
carried
strict
attention
to
the
letter
of
the
law
to
the
point
of
mania
drawing
up
the
preambles
of
his
judgments
with
increasing
minuteness
of
detail
it
was
said
that
he
had
been
heard
sobbing
on
certain
evenings
as
if
he
felt
everything
connected
with
his
life
giving
way
even
that
human
justice
to
which
he
clung
so
despairingly
as
to
a
last
piece
of
wreckage
which
might
save
him
from
sinking
amidst
his
dolorous
remembrance
of
the
tragedy
which
weighed
upon
his
life
his
wife
betrayal
and
violent
death
he
must
above
all
else
have
suffered
at
seeing
that
drama
begin
afresh
with
his
daughter
lucile
of
whom
he
was
so
fond
and
who
was
so
virginal
of
countenance
and
so
strikingly
like
her
mother
she
in
her
turn
was
now
deceiving
her
husband
indeed
she
had
not
been
married
six
months
to
captain
jollivet
before
she
had
taken
a
lover
a
solicitor
petty
clerk
a
tall
fair
youth
with
blue
girlish
eyes
younger
than
herself
the
judge
having
surprised
the
intrigue
suffered
from
it
as
if
it
were
a
renewal
of
that
betrayal
which
had
left
an
wound
in
his
heart
he
recoiled
from
a
painful
explanation
which
would
have
brought
him
perchance
a
repetition
of
the
awful
day
when
his
wife
had
killed
herself
before
his
eyes
after
confessing
her
fault
but
how
abominable
was
that
world
in
which
all
that
he
had
loved
had
betrayed
and
failed
him
and
how
could
one
believe
in
any
human
justice
when
it
was
the
most
beautiful
and
the
best
who
made
one
suffer
so
cruelly
thoughtful
and
morose
judge
gaume
was
seated
in
his
private
room
where
he
had
just
finished
reading
the
de
beauclair
when
the
captain
and
lucile
made
their
appearance
the
violent
article
against
la
crÃªcherie
which
he
had
just
read
seemed
to
him
foolish
clumsy
and
vulgar
and
he
quietly
expressed
his
opinion
to
that
effect
is
not
you
i
hope
my
good
jollivet
who
write
such
articles
as
is
rumoured
no
good
purpose
is
served
by
insulting
one
adversaries
he
said
the
captain
made
a
gesture
of
embarrassment
write
he
retorted
know
very
well
that
i
do
write
it
is
not
to
my
taste
but
true
that
i
give
lebleu
some
ideas
some
notes
you
know
on
scraps
of
paper
and
he
gets
somebody
or
other
to
write
articles
based
on
them
then
as
the
judge
still
pursed
his
lips
disappprovingly
the
captain
went
on
else
can
one
do
one
fights
with
such
weapons
as
one
has
if
those
cursed
madagascar
fevers
had
not
compelled
me
to
send
in
my
papers
i
should
have
fallen
sabre
and
not
pen
in
hand
on
those
idealogues
who
are
demolishing
everything
with
their
criminal
utopian
schemes
ah
yes
indeed
it
would
relieve
me
to
be
able
to
bleed
a
dozen
of
them
lucile
short
and
had
hitherto
remained
silent
with
her
usual
keen
enigmatical
smile
upon
her
lips
but
now
she
turned
so
plainly
ironical
a
glance
upon
her
husband
that
great
man
with
the
victorious
moustaches
that
the
judge
easily
detected
in
it
all
the
merry
disdain
she
felt
for
a
swashbuckler
whom
her
little
hands
toyed
with
as
a
cat
may
toy
with
a
mouse
charles
said
she
be
wicked
do
say
things
that
frighten
me
but
just
then
she
met
her
father
glance
and
feared
lest
her
true
feelings
should
be
divined
so
putting
on
her
candid
virginal
air
again
she
added
it
wrong
of
charles
to
get
so
heated
father
dear
we
ought
to
live
quietly
in
our
little
corner
but
gaume
detected
that
she
was
still
jeering
is
all
very
sad
and
very
cruel
said
he
by
way
of
conclusion
virtually
speaking
to
himself
can
one
decide
what
can
one
do
when
all
deceive
and
devour
one
another
he
rose
painfully
and
took
his
hat
and
gloves
in
order
to
go
to
delaveau
then
in
spite
of
everything
when
once
he
was
in
the
street
and
lucile
of
whom
he
was
so
fond
whatever
the
sufferings
she
caused
him
took
hold
of
his
arm
he
enjoyed
a
moment
of
delightful
forgetfulness
as
after
a
lovers
quarrel
meantime
when
noon
struck
at
the
abyss
delaveau
joined
fernande
in
the
little
opening
into
the
of
the
pavilion
built
by
the
qurignons
which
was
now
the
home
of
the
manager
of
the
works
it
was
a
rather
small
dwelling
for
apart
from
the
dining
and
drawing
rooms
and
the
domestic
offices
the
ground
floor
only
contained
one
other
apartment
which
delaveau
had
made
his
private
room
and
which
communicated
by
a
wooden
gallery
with
the
general
offices
of
the
works
then
on
the
first
and
second
floors
were
some
since
a
young
woman
passionately
fond
of
luxury
had
been
living
in
the
house
carpets
and
hangings
had
imparted
to
the
old
floors
and
dark
walls
some
little
of
the
splendour
that
she
dreamt
of
boisgelin
was
the
first
guest
to
arrive
and
came
unaccompanied
exclaimed
fernande
as
if
greatly
distressed
not
suzanne
with
you
begs
you
to
excuse
her
boisgelin
replied
in
very
correct
fashion
woke
up
this
morning
with
a
sick
headache
and
has
been
unable
to
leave
her
room
each
time
that
there
was
any
question
of
going
to
the
abyss
matters
took
this
course
suzanne
found
some
pretext
for
avoiding
such
an
aggravation
of
her
grief
and
only
delaveau
in
his
blindness
failed
to
understand
the
truth
moreover
boisgelin
immediately
changed
the
conversation
so
here
we
are
on
the
eve
of
the
famous
said
he
is
as
good
as
settled
eh
la
crÃªcherie
will
be
condemned
delaveau
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
does
it
matter
to
us
whether
it
be
condemned
or
not
he
replied
does
us
harm
no
doubt
by
lowering
the
price
of
metal
but
we
do
compete
in
manufactured
articles
and
there
is
nothing
very
serious
as
yet
fernande
who
looked
wondrously
beautiful
that
day
stood
quivering
gazing
at
her
husband
with
flaming
eyes
you
do
know
how
to
hate
she
cried
that
man
set
himself
to
thwart
all
your
plans
founded
at
your
very
door
a
rival
enterprise
the
success
of
which
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
one
you
manage
a
man
too
who
never
ceases
to
be
an
obstacle
and
a
threat
and
you
do
even
desire
to
see
him
crushed
ah
if
he
flung
naked
into
a
ditch
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
from
the
very
first
day
she
had
felt
that
luc
would
be
the
enemy
and
she
could
not
speak
calmly
of
that
man
who
threatened
her
enjoyment
of
life
therein
for
her
lay
his
one
great
unique
crime
with
her
appetite
for
pleasure
and
luxury
she
required
ever
larger
profits
an
abundance
of
prosperity
for
the
works
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
workmen
kneading
fashioning
steel
at
the
flaming
doors
of
their
furnaces
she
was
the
devourer
of
men
and
money
the
one
whose
cravings
the
abyss
with
its
steam
hammers
and
its
huge
machinery
no
longer
sufficed
to
satisfy
and
what
would
become
of
her
hopes
of
future
pomp
and
vanity
of
millions
amassed
and
devoured
if
the
abyss
should
fall
into
difficulties
and
succumb
to
competition
with
that
thought
in
her
mind
she
left
neither
her
husband
nor
boisgelin
any
rest
but
ever
urged
them
on
worried
them
incessantly
seizing
every
opportunity
to
give
expression
to
her
anger
and
her
fears
boisgelin
who
feigned
a
superior
kind
of
way
never
meddling
with
business
matters
but
spending
the
profits
of
the
works
without
counting
them
setting
his
only
glory
in
being
a
handsome
ladykiller
an
elegant
horseman
and
a
great
sportsman
was
none
the
less
accustomed
to
shiver
when
he
heard
fernande
speak
of
possible
ruin
thus
on
the
present
occasion
turning
towards
delaveau
in
whom
he
retained
absolute
confidence
he
inquired
have
no
anxiety
eh
cousin
all
is
going
on
well
here
the
engineer
again
shrugged
his
shoulders
repeat
that
the
works
are
in
no
wise
affected
as
yet
moreover
the
whole
town
is
rising
against
that
man
he
is
mad
we
shall
all
see
now
how
unpopular
he
is
and
if
at
bottom
i
am
well
pleased
with
that
it
is
because
it
will
finish
him
off
in
the
opinion
of
beauclair
before
three
months
have
elapsed
all
the
workmen
that
he
has
taken
from
us
will
be
coming
with
hands
clasped
to
beg
me
to
take
them
back
you
will
see
you
will
see
authority
is
the
only
sound
principle
the
enfranchisement
of
labour
is
arrant
stupidity
for
the
workman
no
longer
does
anything
properly
when
once
he
becomes
his
own
master
silence
fell
then
he
added
more
slowly
with
a
faint
shade
of
anxiety
in
his
eyes
the
same
we
ought
to
be
prudent
la
crÃªcherie
is
not
a
competitor
that
one
can
neglect
and
what
would
alarm
me
would
be
any
lack
of
the
necessary
funds
for
a
struggle
in
some
sudden
emergency
we
live
too
much
from
day
to
day
and
it
is
becoming
indispensable
that
we
should
establish
a
substantial
reserve
fund
by
setting
apart
for
instance
one
third
of
the
annual
profits
fernande
restrained
a
gesture
of
involuntary
protest
that
was
indeed
her
fear
that
her
lover
might
have
to
reduce
his
expenditure
and
that
she
in
her
pride
and
pleasures
might
suffer
therefrom
she
had
to
content
herself
for
the
moment
with
looking
at
boisgelin
but
he
of
his
own
accord
plainly
answered
no
cousin
not
at
the
present
moment
i
ca
set
anything
aside
my
expenses
are
too
heavy
at
the
same
time
i
must
thank
you
once
more
for
you
make
my
money
yield
even
more
than
you
promised
we
will
see
about
the
rest
later
on
we
will
talk
it
over
nevertheless
fernande
remained
in
a
nervous
state
and
her
covert
anger
fell
upon
nise
who
had
just
lunched
alone
under
the
supervision
of
a
maid
who
now
brought
her
into
the
before
taking
her
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
a
little
friend
nise
who
was
now
nearly
seven
years
old
was
growing
quite
pretty
pink
and
fair
and
ever
merry
with
wild
hair
which
made
her
resemble
a
little
curly
sheep
my
dear
boisgelin
said
fernande
a
disobedient
child
who
will
end
by
making
me
quite
just
ask
her
what
she
did
the
other
day
at
that
treat
which
she
offered
to
your
son
paul
and
little
louise
mazelle
without
evincing
the
slightest
alarm
nise
with
her
limpid
blue
eyes
continued
gaily
smiling
at
those
about
her
continued
her
mother
wo
admit
any
but
do
you
know
although
i
had
forbidden
it
a
dozen
times
she
again
opened
the
old
door
in
our
garden
wall
to
admit
all
the
dirty
urchins
of
la
crÃªcherie
into
our
grounds
there
was
that
little
nanet
a
frightful
little
rascal
for
whom
she
has
conceived
an
affection
and
your
boy
paul
was
mixed
up
in
it
and
so
was
louise
mazelle
all
of
them
fraternising
with
the
children
of
that
man
bonnaire
who
left
us
in
such
an
insolent
fashion
yes
paul
with
antoinette
and
louise
with
lucien
and
mademoiselle
nise
and
her
nanet
leading
them
to
the
assault
of
our
yet
she
has
not
even
a
blush
of
shame
on
her
cheeks
you
see
is
just
nise
simply
answered
in
her
clear
voice
did
not
break
anything
we
played
together
very
nicely
he
is
funny
is
nanet
this
answer
made
fernande
quite
angry
you
think
him
funny
do
you
just
listen
to
me
if
ever
i
catch
you
with
him
you
shall
have
no
dessert
for
a
week
i
do
want
you
to
get
me
into
any
unpleasantness
with
those
people
near
us
they
would
go
about
everywhere
saying
that
we
attract
their
children
here
in
order
to
render
them
you
hear
me
this
time
it
is
serious
you
will
have
to
deal
with
me
if
you
see
nanet
again
mamma
said
nise
in
her
quiet
smiling
way
and
when
she
had
gone
off
with
the
maid
after
kissing
everybody
the
mother
concluded
is
very
simple
i
shall
have
the
door
walled
up
in
that
way
i
shall
be
certain
that
the
children
wo
communicate
there
is
nothing
worse
than
that
it
corrupts
them
neither
delaveau
nor
boisgelin
had
intervened
for
on
the
one
hand
they
saw
in
this
affair
only
so
much
childishness
and
on
the
other
they
approved
of
severe
measures
when
good
order
was
in
question
but
the
future
was
germinating
stubborn
mademoiselle
nise
had
carried
away
in
her
little
heart
the
thought
of
nanet
who
was
funny
and
played
so
nicely
at
last
the
guests
arrived
the
gouriers
with
chÃ¢telard
then
judge
gaume
with
the
jollivets
abbÃ©
marle
was
the
last
to
appear
late
according
to
his
wont
though
the
mazelles
had
expressly
promised
to
come
and
take
coffee
some
obstacle
prevented
them
from
sharing
the
repast
thus
there
were
only
ten
at
table
but
then
they
had
desired
to
be
few
in
number
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
chat
at
their
ease
besides
the
of
which
fernande
felt
ashamed
was
such
a
small
one
that
the
old
mahogany
sideboard
interfered
with
the
service
whenever
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
round
the
table
from
the
serving
of
the
fish
some
delicious
trout
of
the
mionne
the
conversation
naturally
fell
on
la
crÃªcherie
and
luc
and
what
was
said
by
those
educated
in
a
position
to
know
the
truth
about
what
they
called
utopia
proved
scarcely
one
whit
more
sensible
or
intelligent
than
the
extraordinary
views
expressed
by
such
people
as
dacheux
and
laboque
the
only
man
who
might
have
understood
the
real
position
was
chÃ¢telard
but
then
he
preferred
to
jest
know
said
he
the
boys
and
girls
there
grow
up
all
together
in
the
same
and
workshops
so
that
we
may
expect
the
little
town
to
become
a
populous
one
very
rapidly
with
their
loose
theories
they
will
all
be
papas
and
mammas
and
there
will
be
quite
a
tribe
of
children
running
about
horrible
exclaimed
fernande
with
an
air
of
profound
disgust
for
she
affected
extreme
prudishness
then
for
a
few
moments
the
free
love
theories
attributed
to
the
denizens
of
la
crÃªcherie
formed
the
topic
of
conversation
but
a
matter
of
that
kind
did
not
worry
delaveau
in
his
estimation
the
serious
point
was
the
undermining
of
authority
the
criminal
dream
of
living
without
a
master
a
conception
as
that
is
beyond
me
he
exclaimed
will
their
future
city
be
governed
to
speak
only
of
the
works
they
say
that
by
association
they
will
suppress
the
wage
system
and
that
there
will
be
a
just
division
of
wealth
when
only
workers
are
left
each
giving
his
share
of
toil
to
the
community
but
i
can
conceive
of
no
more
dangerous
dream
than
that
for
it
is
irrealisable
is
it
not
monsieur
gourier
the
mayor
who
was
eating
with
his
face
bent
over
his
plate
spent
some
time
in
wiping
his
mouth
before
he
answered
for
he
noticed
that
the
was
looking
at
him
no
doubt
he
said
at
last
one
must
not
lightly
condemn
the
principle
of
association
there
is
great
strength
in
association
and
we
ourselves
may
be
called
upon
to
make
use
of
it
this
prudent
reply
incensed
the
captain
who
retorted
angrily
would
you
condemn
once
and
for
all
the
execrable
deeds
which
that
man
i
speak
of
that
monsieur
luc
is
planning
against
all
that
we
love
that
old
france
of
ours
such
as
the
swords
of
our
fathers
made
it
and
bequeathed
it
to
us
some
mutton
cutlets
served
with
asparagus
heads
were
now
being
handed
round
and
a
general
outcry
against
luc
arose
the
mention
of
his
hated
name
sufficed
to
draw
them
all
together
unite
them
closely
in
alarm
for
their
threatened
interests
and
with
an
imperious
craving
for
resistance
and
revenge
somebody
however
was
cruel
enough
to
ask
gourier
for
news
of
his
son
achille
the
renegade
and
the
mayor
had
to
curse
the
lad
once
again
chÃ¢telard
alone
tried
to
tack
about
and
keep
the
discussion
on
a
jocular
footing
but
in
this
he
failed
for
the
captain
continued
prophesying
the
worst
disasters
if
the
were
not
immediately
kicked
into
obedience
and
order
and
his
words
disseminated
such
a
panic
that
boisgelin
becoming
anxious
again
appealed
to
delaveau
from
whom
there
happily
came
a
reassuring
declaration
man
is
already
hit
declared
the
manager
of
the
abyss
prosperity
of
la
crÃªcherie
is
only
on
the
surface
and
an
accident
would
suffice
to
bring
everything
to
the
ground
thus
for
instance
my
wife
was
lately
giving
me
some
particulars
broke
in
fernande
happy
to
have
an
opportunity
of
relieving
her
feelings
information
came
to
me
from
my
laundress
she
knows
one
of
our
former
hands
a
man
named
ragu
who
left
us
in
order
to
go
to
the
new
works
well
it
seems
that
ragu
is
declaring
everywhere
that
he
has
had
quite
enough
of
that
dirty
den
that
the
men
are
bored
to
death
there
that
he
is
the
only
one
to
complain
and
that
one
of
these
fine
days
they
will
all
be
coming
back
here
ah
who
will
begin
who
will
deal
the
blow
necessary
to
make
that
man
luc
totter
and
fall
to
pieces
there
the
laboque
lawsuit
said
boisgelin
coming
to
the
young
woman
help
hope
that
will
suffice
for
everything
fresh
silence
ensued
whilst
some
roast
ducks
made
their
appearance
although
the
laboque
lawsuit
was
the
real
motive
of
that
friendly
gathering
nobody
as
yet
had
dared
to
speak
of
it
in
presence
of
the
silence
which
judge
gaume
preserved
he
ate
but
little
his
secret
sorrows
having
brought
him
a
complaint
of
the
digestive
organs
and
he
contented
himself
with
listening
to
the
others
and
gazing
at
them
with
his
cold
grey
eyes
whence
he
knew
how
to
withdraw
all
expression
never
had
he
been
seen
in
a
less
communicative
mood
and
this
ended
by
embarrassing
the
others
who
would
have
liked
to
know
on
what
footing
to
treat
him
and
at
least
have
some
certainty
as
to
the
judgment
which
he
would
deliver
although
no
thought
of
possible
acquittal
at
his
hands
entered
anybody
mind
they
all
hoped
that
he
would
have
the
good
taste
to
pledge
himself
in
a
sufficiently
clear
fashion
again
it
was
the
captain
who
advanced
to
the
assault
law
is
formal
is
it
not
monsieur
le
prÃ©sident
he
inquired
damage
done
to
anybody
must
be
repaired
doubt
answered
gaume
more
was
expected
from
him
but
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
thereupon
by
way
of
compelling
him
to
pledge
himself
more
thoroughly
the
clouque
affair
was
noisily
discussed
that
filthy
stream
became
one
of
the
former
adornments
of
beauclair
it
was
not
right
that
people
should
steal
a
town
water
in
such
a
fashion
as
that
man
luc
had
done
particularly
to
give
it
to
peasants
whose
brains
had
been
turned
to
such
a
point
that
they
had
converted
their
village
into
a
hotbed
of
furious
anarchy
which
threatened
the
whole
region
all
the
terror
of
the
now
became
apparent
for
assuredly
the
ancient
and
holy
principle
of
property
was
in
sore
distress
if
the
sons
of
the
peasants
of
former
times
had
reached
such
a
point
as
to
place
their
strips
of
land
in
common
it
was
high
time
that
justice
should
interfere
and
put
a
stop
to
such
a
scandal
we
may
be
quite
easy
boisgelin
ended
by
saying
in
a
flattering
tone
cause
of
society
will
be
in
good
hands
there
is
nothing
above
a
just
judgment
rendered
in
all
liberty
by
an
honest
conscience
doubt
gaume
simply
repeated
and
this
time
it
was
necessary
to
rest
content
with
that
vague
remark
in
which
they
all
strove
to
detect
the
certainty
of
luc
conviction
the
meal
was
now
virtually
over
for
after
a
russian
salad
there
were
only
some
strawberry
ices
and
the
dessert
but
the
guests
stomachs
were
comforted
and
they
laughed
a
good
deal
for
they
were
convinced
of
victory
when
they
had
gone
into
the
to
take
coffee
and
the
mazelles
arrived
the
latter
were
as
usual
greeted
with
somewhat
jocose
friendliness
those
worthy
folk
living
on
their
income
and
personifying
the
delights
of
idleness
moved
one
heart
madame
mazelle
complaint
was
no
better
but
she
was
delighted
at
having
obtained
from
doctor
novarre
some
new
wafers
which
enabled
her
to
eat
anything
with
impunity
it
was
only
such
matters
as
the
abominable
stories
of
la
crÃªcherie
the
threat
that
rentes
would
be
done
away
with
and
that
the
right
of
inheritance
would
be
abolished
that
now
gave
her
a
turn
but
what
was
the
use
of
talking
about
disagreeable
things
mazelle
who
watched
over
his
wife
with
profound
satisfaction
winked
at
the
others
and
begged
them
to
raise
those
horrid
subjects
no
more
since
they
had
such
a
bad
effect
on
madame
mazelle
failing
health
and
then
the
gathering
became
delightful
they
all
hastened
to
revert
to
the
happiness
of
life
a
life
of
wealth
and
enjoyment
of
which
they
plucked
all
the
flowers
at
last
amidst
growing
anger
and
hatred
the
day
of
the
famous
lawsuit
dawned
never
had
beauclair
been
so
upset
by
furious
passion
luc
in
the
first
instance
had
felt
astonished
at
laboque
writ
and
had
simply
laughed
at
it
particularly
as
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
the
claim
for
thousand
francs
by
way
of
damages
could
be
sustained
if
the
clouque
had
dried
up
it
would
in
the
first
place
be
difficult
for
anybody
to
prove
that
this
had
been
caused
by
the
capturing
of
hillside
springs
at
la
crÃªcherie
and
moreover
those
springs
belonged
to
the
estate
to
the
jordans
and
were
free
from
all
servitude
in
such
wise
that
the
owner
had
a
full
right
to
dispose
of
them
as
he
pleased
on
the
other
hand
laboque
must
assuredly
base
his
claim
for
damages
on
facts
proving
that
he
had
really
sustained
injury
and
loss
but
he
simply
made
such
a
feeble
and
clumsy
attempt
to
do
so
that
no
court
of
justice
in
the
world
could
possibly
decide
in
his
favour
as
luc
jocularly
put
it
it
was
he
who
ought
to
have
claimed
a
public
grant
as
a
reward
for
having
delivered
the
waterside
landowners
from
a
source
of
infection
of
which
they
had
long
complained
the
town
now
simply
had
to
fill
up
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
sell
the
land
for
building
purposes
thereby
putting
a
few
hundred
thousand
francs
into
its
coffers
thus
luc
laughed
not
imagining
that
such
a
lawsuit
as
laboque
could
be
at
all
serious
it
was
only
afterwards
on
finding
rancour
and
hostility
rising
against
him
on
every
side
that
he
began
to
realise
the
gravity
of
the
situation
and
the
peril
in
which
his
work
would
be
placed
this
was
a
first
painful
shock
for
him
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
maliciousness
of
man
in
giving
battle
to
the
old
world
he
had
fully
expected
that
the
latter
would
not
yield
him
place
without
anger
and
resistance
he
was
prepared
for
the
calvary
he
foresaw
the
stones
and
mud
with
which
the
ungrateful
multitude
usually
pelt
precursors
yet
his
heart
wavered
as
he
realised
the
approach
of
folly
cruelty
and
betrayal
he
understood
that
behind
the
laboques
and
the
other
petty
traders
there
was
the
whole
all
who
possess
and
are
unwilling
to
part
with
aught
of
their
possessions
his
attempts
at
association
and
placed
capitalist
society
based
on
the
system
in
such
peril
that
he
became
for
it
a
public
enemy
of
which
it
must
rid
itself
at
any
cost
and
it
was
the
abyss
and
la
guerdache
and
the
whole
town
and
authority
in
every
form
that
were
now
bestirring
themselves
joining
in
the
struggle
and
striving
to
crush
him
if
he
fell
that
pack
of
wolves
would
rush
upon
him
and
devour
him
he
knew
the
names
of
those
enemies
functionaries
traders
mere
with
placid
faces
who
would
have
eaten
him
alive
had
they
seen
him
fall
at
a
street
corner
and
therefore
mastering
his
distress
of
heart
he
prepared
for
battle
full
of
the
conviction
that
one
can
found
nothing
without
battling
and
that
all
great
human
work
is
sealed
with
human
blood
it
was
on
a
tuesday
a
market
day
that
laboque
action
was
heard
by
the
civil
court
over
which
judge
gaume
presided
beauclair
was
in
a
state
of
uproar
all
the
folk
who
had
come
in
from
the
neighbouring
villages
helped
to
increase
the
general
feverishness
on
the
place
de
la
mairie
and
in
the
rue
de
brias
sÅurette
who
felt
anxious
had
therefore
begged
luc
to
ask
a
few
strong
friends
to
accompany
him
but
he
stubbornly
refused
to
do
so
he
resolved
to
go
to
the
court
alone
just
as
he
had
resolved
to
defend
himself
in
person
having
engaged
an
advocate
simply
as
a
matter
of
form
when
he
entered
the
which
was
small
and
already
crowded
with
noisy
people
silence
suddenly
fell
and
the
eager
curiosity
which
greets
an
isolated
unarmed
victim
ready
for
sacrifice
became
manifest
luc
quiet
courage
increased
the
rage
of
his
enemies
who
pronounced
his
demeanour
to
be
insolent
he
remained
standing
in
front
of
the
bench
allotted
to
defendants
and
whilst
quietly
gazing
at
the
closely
packed
people
around
him
he
recognised
laboque
dacheux
caffiaux
and
other
shopkeepers
among
all
the
many
furious
enemies
with
ardent
faces
whom
he
saw
for
the
first
time
however
he
felt
a
little
relieved
on
finding
that
the
intimates
of
la
guerdache
and
the
abyss
had
at
least
had
the
good
taste
to
refrain
from
coming
to
see
him
delivered
to
the
beasts
long
and
exciting
proceedings
were
anticipated
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
laboque
has
chosen
one
of
those
provincial
advocates
with
a
reputation
for
maliciousness
who
are
the
terror
of
a
region
and
indeed
the
best
time
which
luc
enemies
spent
was
when
this
man
spoke
knowing
how
flimsy
were
the
legal
grounds
on
which
the
demand
for
damages
was
based
he
contented
himself
with
ridiculing
the
reforms
attempted
at
la
crÃªcherie
he
made
his
hearers
laugh
a
good
deal
with
the
comical
and
distorted
picture
which
he
drew
of
the
proposed
future
society
and
he
raised
general
indignation
when
he
pictured
the
children
of
both
sexes
being
corrupted
the
holy
institution
of
marriage
being
abolished
and
free
love
and
all
such
horrors
taking
its
place
nevertheless
the
general
opinion
was
that
he
had
not
found
the
supreme
insult
or
argument
the
bludgeon
blow
by
which
a
suit
is
gained
and
a
man
for
ever
crushed
and
so
great
therefore
became
the
anxiety
that
when
luc
in
his
turn
spoke
his
slightest
words
were
greeted
with
murmurs
he
spoke
very
simply
refrained
from
replying
to
the
attacks
made
upon
his
enterprise
and
contented
himself
with
showing
with
decisive
force
that
demands
were
would
he
not
rather
have
rendered
a
service
to
beauclair
if
he
had
indeed
dried
up
that
pestilential
clouque
and
presented
the
town
with
good
building
land
it
was
not
even
proved
however
that
the
works
carried
out
at
la
crÃªcherie
had
caused
the
disappearance
of
the
torrent
and
he
was
waiting
for
the
other
side
to
give
proof
of
it
when
he
concluded
some
of
his
bitterness
of
heart
appeared
for
he
declared
that
if
he
desired
nobody
thanks
for
whatever
useful
work
he
might
have
done
he
would
be
happy
if
people
would
but
allow
him
to
pursue
his
enterprises
in
peace
without
seeking
groundless
quarrels
with
him
on
several
occasions
judge
gaume
had
to
enjoin
silence
on
the
audience
nevertheless
when
the
public
prosecutor
also
had
spoken
in
a
designedly
confused
manner
in
turn
praising
and
condemning
both
parties
laboque
advocate
replied
in
so
violent
a
fashion
calling
luc
an
anarchist
bent
on
destroying
the
town
that
loud
acclamations
burst
forth
and
the
judge
had
to
threaten
that
he
would
order
the
court
to
be
cleared
if
such
demonstrations
were
renewed
then
he
postponed
judgment
for
a
fortnight
when
that
fortnight
was
past
the
popular
passions
had
become
yet
more
heated
and
folk
almost
came
to
blows
on
the
in
discussing
the
probable
terms
of
the
judgment
nearly
everybody
however
was
convinced
that
it
would
be
a
severe
one
fixing
the
damages
at
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
francs
and
ordering
the
defendant
to
restore
the
clouque
to
its
former
condition
at
the
same
time
some
people
wagged
their
heads
and
felt
sure
of
nothing
for
they
had
not
been
satisfied
with
judge
gaume
demeanour
in
court
anxiety
was
caused
too
by
the
manner
in
which
the
judge
had
shut
himself
up
at
home
on
the
morrow
of
the
hearing
under
the
pretence
of
suffering
from
some
indisposition
it
was
said
that
he
was
really
in
perfect
health
and
had
simply
desired
to
place
himself
beyond
any
pressure
refusing
to
see
people
lest
they
might
try
to
influence
his
judicial
conscience
what
did
he
do
in
that
silent
house
of
his
whose
doors
and
windows
were
kept
strictly
closed
and
which
his
daughter
even
was
not
allowed
to
enter
to
what
moral
struggle
what
internal
drama
had
he
fallen
a
prey
amidst
his
wrecked
life
the
collapse
of
all
that
he
had
loved
and
all
that
he
had
believed
in
those
were
questions
which
occupied
many
people
but
which
none
could
answer
judgment
was
to
be
delivered
at
noon
at
the
outset
of
the
sitting
and
the
room
was
yet
more
crowded
and
excited
than
on
the
former
occasion
laughter
rang
out
and
words
of
hope
and
violence
were
exchanged
from
one
to
the
other
end
all
luc
enemies
had
come
to
see
him
annihilated
and
he
had
again
refused
to
let
anybody
accompany
him
preferring
to
present
himself
alone
the
better
to
express
the
peacefulness
of
his
mission
he
stood
up
smiling
and
looking
around
him
without
even
appearing
to
suspect
that
all
that
growling
anger
was
directed
against
himself
at
last
punctual
to
the
minute
judge
gaume
came
in
followed
by
his
two
assessors
and
the
public
prosecutor
there
was
no
need
for
the
usher
to
command
silence
the
chatter
suddenly
ceased
and
the
faces
of
one
and
all
were
stretched
forward
aglow
with
anxious
curiosity
the
judge
had
in
the
first
instance
seated
himself
then
he
rose
holding
the
paper
on
which
his
judgment
was
written
and
for
a
moment
he
remained
thus
motionless
and
silent
with
his
eyes
gazing
far
away
beyond
the
crowd
at
last
slowly
and
without
the
faintest
emphasis
he
began
to
read
his
judgment
it
was
a
long
business
for
followed
with
monotonous
regularity
presenting
the
various
questions
submitted
to
the
court
in
full
detail
and
under
every
possible
aspect
the
people
present
listened
without
understanding
much
of
what
was
read
and
without
managing
to
foresee
the
conclusion
so
incessantly
and
closely
did
arguments
on
either
side
follow
one
another
it
seemed
however
at
each
forward
step
that
contentions
were
adopted
by
the
court
that
no
real
damage
had
been
done
to
another
and
that
every
landowner
had
a
right
to
execute
what
work
he
pleased
on
his
own
land
when
no
servitude
existed
to
restrain
him
and
the
decision
at
last
burst
forth
luc
was
acquitted
the
action
was
dismissed
at
first
a
moment
of
stupefaction
ensued
in
the
then
everybody
having
understood
the
position
there
came
hooting
and
violent
threatening
shouts
what
the
excited
crowd
maddened
by
lies
for
months
past
was
robbed
of
its
promised
victim
it
demanded
that
victim
it
claimed
him
that
it
might
tear
him
to
pieces
since
an
attempt
to
rob
it
of
him
was
made
at
the
last
moment
by
a
judge
who
had
evidently
sold
himself
was
not
luc
the
public
enemy
the
stranger
who
had
come
nobody
knew
whence
to
corrupt
beauclair
ruin
its
trade
and
foment
civil
war
in
its
midst
by
banding
the
workmen
together
against
their
masters
and
had
he
not
with
diabolical
wickedness
stolen
the
town
water
dried
up
a
stream
whose
disappearance
was
a
disaster
for
all
who
had
property
near
its
banks
the
de
beauclair
had
repeated
those
accusations
every
week
all
the
authorities
all
the
gentlefolk
had
spread
them
abroad
and
now
the
humbler
ones
blinded
and
enraged
convinced
that
a
pestilence
would
come
from
la
crÃªcherie
red
and
demanded
death
fists
were
thrust
forward
and
the
cries
increased
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
death
with
him
very
pale
with
his
features
rigid
judge
gaume
remained
standing
amidst
the
uproar
he
wished
to
speak
and
give
orders
for
the
court
to
be
cleared
but
he
had
to
renounce
all
hope
of
making
himself
heard
and
for
dignity
sake
he
had
to
rest
content
with
suspending
the
sitting
by
withdrawing
from
the
court
followed
by
his
two
assessors
and
the
public
prosecutor
luc
had
remained
calm
and
smiling
beside
his
bench
he
had
been
as
much
surprised
as
his
adversaries
by
the
tenor
of
the
judgment
for
he
knew
in
what
a
vitiated
atmosphere
the
judge
lived
it
was
comforting
to
meet
a
just
man
amid
so
much
human
baseness
when
however
the
cries
of
death
burst
forth
luc
smile
became
a
sad
one
and
his
heart
filled
with
bitterness
as
he
turned
towards
that
howling
throng
what
had
he
done
to
those
petty
those
tradesmen
those
workmen
had
he
not
desired
to
benefit
all
was
he
not
working
in
order
that
all
might
become
happy
loving
and
brotherly
but
the
fists
still
threatened
him
and
the
shouts
lashed
him
more
violently
than
ever
death
to
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
see
those
poor
folk
so
wild
maddened
by
falsehoods
caused
luc
profound
grief
for
he
loved
them
in
spite
of
everything
he
restrained
his
tears
for
he
wished
to
remain
erect
proud
and
courageous
beneath
those
insults
the
public
thinking
itself
braved
would
have
ended
however
by
breaking
down
the
oaken
partitions
in
order
to
get
at
him
if
some
guards
had
not
at
last
succeeded
in
thrusting
him
out
of
the
and
securing
the
doors
then
on
behalf
of
judge
gaume
the
clerk
of
the
court
came
to
beg
luc
to
refrain
from
leaving
immediately
for
fear
of
some
accident
and
eventually
the
clerk
prevailed
on
him
to
wait
a
few
minutes
in
the
room
of
the
doorkeeper
of
the
palace
of
justice
whilst
the
crowd
was
dispersing
but
if
luc
consented
to
do
this
he
none
the
less
experienced
a
feeling
of
shame
and
revolt
at
being
obliged
to
hide
himself
he
spent
in
that
doorkeeper
room
the
most
painful
fifteen
minutes
of
his
life
for
he
thought
it
cowardly
not
to
face
the
crowd
and
was
indignant
that
the
position
of
an
apparent
culprit
should
thus
be
forced
upon
him
directly
the
approaches
of
the
palace
of
justice
had
been
cleared
he
insisted
on
going
home
on
foot
and
unaccompanied
by
anybody
he
had
merely
a
light
with
him
and
was
even
sorry
that
he
had
brought
it
for
fear
lest
anybody
should
imagine
that
he
had
done
so
for
purposes
of
defence
he
had
all
beauclair
to
cross
and
he
set
out
slowly
and
quietly
along
the
streets
until
he
reached
the
place
de
la
mairie
nobody
seemed
to
notice
him
the
people
who
had
quitted
the
court
had
waited
for
him
for
a
few
minutes
then
feeling
certain
that
he
would
not
venture
out
for
some
hours
they
had
gone
off
to
spread
the
news
of
the
acquittal
through
the
town
but
on
the
place
de
la
mairie
where
the
market
was
being
held
luc
was
recognised
he
was
pointed
out
and
a
few
persons
even
began
to
follow
him
not
as
yet
with
evil
intentions
but
solely
to
see
what
might
happen
there
were
only
some
peasants
and
their
customers
present
mere
sightseers
who
were
not
mixed
up
in
the
quarrel
thus
matters
only
took
a
serious
turn
when
the
young
man
turned
into
the
rue
de
brias
at
the
corner
of
which
in
front
of
his
shop
laboque
infuriated
by
his
defeat
was
venting
his
anger
amidst
a
small
crowd
of
people
all
the
tradespeople
of
the
neighbourhood
had
hastened
to
establishment
directly
they
had
heard
the
disastrous
tidings
what
was
it
true
then
la
crÃªcherie
would
be
free
to
finish
ruining
them
with
its
stores
since
the
judges
took
its
part
caffiaux
who
looked
overwhelmed
preserved
silence
full
of
thoughts
which
he
would
not
express
but
dacheux
the
butcher
with
all
his
blood
rushing
to
his
face
showed
himself
one
of
the
most
violent
eager
to
defend
his
meat
sacred
meat
meat
the
privileged
food
of
the
wealthy
and
he
even
talked
of
killing
people
rather
than
reduce
his
prices
by
a
single
centime
madame
mitaine
for
her
part
had
not
come
she
had
never
been
in
favour
of
the
lawsuit
and
she
simply
declared
that
she
should
go
on
selling
bread
as
long
as
she
found
buyers
and
that
for
the
rest
she
would
see
afterwards
laboque
however
boiling
over
with
fury
was
for
the
tenth
time
recounting
the
abominable
treachery
of
judge
gaume
when
all
at
once
he
perceived
luc
quietly
walking
past
his
shop
that
ironmongery
shop
whose
ruin
he
was
consummating
such
audacity
brought
laboque
rage
to
a
climax
and
he
almost
threw
himself
on
the
young
man
as
half
stifled
by
his
rising
bile
he
growled
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
luc
without
pausing
contented
himself
with
turning
his
calm
brave
eyes
on
the
tumultuous
throng
whence
came
laboque
husky
invectives
this
was
taken
by
all
as
an
act
of
provocation
and
a
general
clamour
arose
gathered
force
and
became
like
a
tempest
blast
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
death
with
him
luc
meantime
as
if
he
himself
were
not
in
question
quietly
went
his
way
glancing
to
right
and
left
like
one
who
is
interested
in
the
sights
of
the
streets
but
almost
the
whole
band
had
begun
to
follow
him
with
louder
and
louder
hoots
and
threats
and
the
outrageous
words
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
death
with
him
and
those
shouts
never
ceased
but
grew
and
spread
as
he
went
at
a
leisurely
pace
up
the
rue
de
brias
out
of
each
shop
came
fresh
tradespeople
to
join
the
demonstration
women
showed
themselves
in
the
doorways
and
hooted
the
young
man
as
he
passed
some
in
their
exasperation
even
rushed
up
and
shouted
with
the
men
death
with
the
thief
and
poisoner
luc
saw
one
of
them
a
fair
young
woman
a
fruiterer
wife
charmingly
beautiful
showing
her
fine
white
teeth
as
she
shouted
insults
after
him
and
threatening
him
with
her
hands
whose
rosy
seemed
eager
to
tear
him
to
pieces
children
also
had
begun
to
run
after
him
and
there
was
one
some
five
or
six
years
old
no
bigger
than
a
who
almost
threw
himself
between
the
young
man
legs
in
order
that
he
might
be
the
better
heard
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
poor
little
urchin
who
could
have
already
taught
him
to
raise
that
shout
of
hatred
but
matters
became
worse
when
luc
passed
the
factories
situated
in
the
upper
part
of
the
street
the
workgirls
of
gourier
boot
manufactory
appeared
at
their
windows
clapped
their
hands
and
howled
then
there
were
even
the
workmen
of
the
chodorge
and
mirande
factories
who
stood
smoking
on
the
waiting
for
the
bells
to
ring
the
close
of
the
and
who
brutified
by
servitude
likewise
joined
in
the
demonstration
one
thin
little
fellow
with
carroty
hair
and
big
blurred
eyes
seemed
stricken
with
insanity
so
furiously
did
he
rush
about
shouting
louder
than
all
the
others
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
death
with
him
ah
that
ascent
of
the
rue
de
brias
with
that
growing
band
of
enemies
at
his
heels
amidst
that
ignoble
torrent
of
threats
and
insults
luc
remembered
the
evening
of
his
arrival
at
beauclair
four
years
previously
when
the
black
tramp
tramp
of
the
disinherited
starvelings
along
that
same
street
had
filled
him
with
such
active
compassion
that
he
had
vowed
to
devote
his
life
to
the
salvation
of
the
wretched
what
had
he
done
for
four
years
past
that
so
much
hatred
should
have
sprung
up
against
him
he
had
made
himself
the
apostle
of
the
morrow
the
apostle
of
a
community
all
solidarity
and
brotherliness
organised
by
the
ennoblement
of
work
work
the
regulator
of
human
wealth
he
had
given
an
example
of
what
he
desired
to
establish
at
that
la
crÃªcherie
where
the
future
city
was
germinating
and
where
such
additional
justice
and
happiness
as
was
for
the
time
possible
already
reigned
and
that
had
sufficed
the
whole
town
regarded
him
as
a
malefactor
for
he
could
feel
that
the
whole
of
it
was
behind
the
band
now
barking
at
his
heels
how
bitter
was
the
suffering
that
accompanied
that
which
all
just
men
must
make
amidst
the
blows
of
the
very
beings
whose
redemption
they
seek
to
hasten
yet
as
for
those
whose
quiet
digestions
he
troubled
luc
excused
them
for
hating
him
for
were
they
not
terrified
by
the
thought
of
having
to
share
their
now
egotistical
enjoyment
with
others
he
also
excused
those
shopkeepers
who
ascribed
their
ruin
to
his
malice
when
he
simply
dreamt
of
a
better
employment
of
social
forces
and
of
preventing
all
useless
waste
of
the
public
fortune
and
he
even
excused
those
workmen
whom
he
had
come
to
save
from
misery
and
for
whom
he
was
so
laboriously
raising
a
city
of
justice
yet
who
hooted
and
insulted
him
to
such
a
degree
indeed
had
their
brains
been
fogged
and
their
hearts
chilled
only
if
he
excused
them
all
in
his
sorrowful
brotherliness
he
bled
indeed
at
finding
amongst
the
most
insulting
those
very
toilers
of
factory
and
workshop
whom
he
desired
to
make
the
nobles
the
free
and
happy
men
of
luc
was
still
ascending
that
endless
rue
de
brias
and
the
pack
of
wolves
was
still
increasing
in
numbers
their
shouts
knowing
no
cessation
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
death
with
him
for
a
moment
he
paused
turned
and
looked
at
all
those
people
in
order
that
they
might
not
imagine
that
he
was
fleeing
and
as
there
happened
to
be
some
piles
of
stones
thereabouts
one
man
stooped
down
took
up
a
stone
and
flung
it
at
him
immediately
afterwards
others
stooped
and
the
stones
began
to
rain
upon
him
amidst
threats
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
death
with
him
so
now
he
was
being
stoned
however
he
made
not
a
gesture
even
but
resumed
his
walk
persevering
in
the
ascent
of
his
calvary
his
hands
were
empty
he
had
with
him
no
weapon
save
his
light
and
this
he
had
slipped
under
his
arm
but
he
remained
very
calm
full
of
the
idea
that
if
he
were
destined
to
fulfil
his
mission
it
would
render
him
invulnerable
his
heart
alone
suffered
cruelly
rent
as
it
was
by
the
sight
of
so
much
error
and
madness
tears
rose
to
his
eyes
and
he
had
to
make
a
great
effort
to
prevent
them
from
flowing
down
his
cheeks
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
death
with
him
still
and
ever
did
those
cries
resound
a
stone
at
last
struck
one
of
luc
heels
then
another
grazed
his
hip
it
had
become
a
game
now
the
very
children
took
part
in
it
but
they
were
unskilful
and
most
of
the
stones
rebounded
over
the
ground
twice
however
did
pebbles
pass
so
near
luc
head
that
one
might
have
thought
him
struck
he
no
longer
turned
round
but
still
and
ever
ascended
the
rue
de
brias
at
the
same
leisurely
pace
as
before
like
one
who
after
going
for
a
stroll
is
returning
home
but
at
last
a
stone
did
hit
him
tearing
his
right
ear
and
then
another
striking
his
left
hand
cut
the
palm
of
it
open
at
this
his
blood
gushed
out
and
fell
in
big
red
drops
upon
the
ground
death
with
the
thief
and
poisoner
to
death
with
him
some
of
the
crowd
still
cried
but
an
eddy
of
panic
momentarily
stayed
the
advance
several
people
ran
off
seized
with
cowardice
now
that
the
moment
to
kill
the
man
seemed
to
have
arrived
some
of
the
women
too
shrieked
and
carried
the
children
away
in
their
arms
only
the
most
furious
fanatics
then
kept
up
the
pursuit
luc
still
continuing
his
painful
journey
just
glanced
at
his
hand
then
after
wiping
his
ear
with
his
handkerchief
he
wrapped
the
latter
over
his
bleeding
palm
but
he
had
slackened
his
pace
and
could
hear
his
pursuers
drawing
quite
near
to
him
when
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
he
detected
the
ardent
panting
of
the
throng
he
turned
round
for
the
last
time
rushing
on
frantically
in
the
front
rank
was
the
short
and
scraggy
workman
with
carroty
hair
and
big
dull
eyes
he
was
a
smith
belonging
to
the
abyss
it
was
said
with
a
final
bound
he
reached
the
man
whom
he
had
been
following
from
the
bottom
of
the
street
and
though
there
seemed
to
be
no
motive
for
his
frenzied
hatred
he
spat
with
the
greatest
violence
in
his
face
death
with
the
thief
to
death
with
the
poisoner
to
death
with
him
luc
had
at
last
ascended
his
calvary
he
was
at
the
top
of
the
rue
de
brias
now
but
he
staggered
beneath
that
final
abominable
outrage
his
face
became
frightfully
pale
and
an
involuntary
impulse
of
his
whole
being
prompted
him
to
raise
his
uninjured
hand
and
clench
it
vengefully
he
looked
like
some
superb
giant
beside
a
wretched
dwarf
for
with
one
blow
he
could
have
felled
the
little
workman
to
the
ground
but
his
consciousness
of
strength
enabled
him
to
restrain
himself
he
did
not
bring
down
his
fist
from
his
eyes
however
flowed
two
big
tears
tears
of
infinite
grief
which
hitherto
he
had
been
able
to
keep
back
but
which
he
could
now
no
longer
hide
such
had
become
the
bitterness
of
his
feelings
he
wept
to
think
that
there
should
be
so
much
ignorance
so
terrible
a
misunderstanding
that
all
those
poor
unhappy
toilers
should
refuse
to
be
saved
and
they
after
sneering
at
him
allowed
him
to
return
home
bleeding
and
all
alone
in
the
evening
luc
shut
himself
up
in
the
little
pavilion
which
he
still
occupied
at
the
end
of
the
park
alongside
the
road
to
les
combettes
his
acquittal
did
not
leave
him
any
illusions
the
violence
displayed
towards
him
that
afternoon
the
savage
pursuit
of
the
crowd
told
him
what
warfare
would
be
waged
against
him
now
that
the
whole
town
was
rising
these
were
the
supreme
convulsions
of
an
expiring
social
system
which
was
unwilling
to
die
it
resisted
and
struggled
furiously
with
the
hope
of
staying
the
march
of
mankind
some
the
partisans
of
authority
set
salvation
in
pitiless
repression
others
the
sentimentalists
appealed
to
the
past
and
its
poetry
to
all
indeed
that
man
weeps
for
when
he
is
forced
to
quit
it
for
ever
and
others
again
seized
with
exasperation
joined
the
revolutionaries
as
if
eager
to
finish
matters
at
once
and
thus
luc
felt
that
he
had
virtually
been
pursued
by
all
beauclair
which
was
like
a
miniature
world
amidst
the
great
one
and
if
he
remained
brave
and
still
resolved
for
battle
he
was
none
the
less
bitterly
distressed
and
anxious
to
hide
it
during
the
hours
few
and
far
between
when
he
felt
weakness
coming
over
him
he
preferred
to
shut
himself
up
and
drain
his
cup
of
sorrow
to
the
dregs
in
privacy
only
showing
himself
once
more
when
he
was
hale
and
brave
again
that
evening
therefore
he
barred
both
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
pavilion
and
gave
orders
that
nobody
was
to
be
admitted
to
see
him
about
eleven
however
he
fancied
that
he
could
hear
some
light
footsteps
on
the
road
then
came
a
low
call
scarce
audible
which
made
him
shiver
he
went
to
open
the
window
and
on
looking
between
the
laths
of
the
shutters
he
perceived
a
slender
form
then
a
very
gentle
voice
ascended
saying
is
i
monsieur
luc
i
must
speak
to
you
at
once
it
was
the
voice
of
josine
luc
did
not
even
pause
to
reflect
but
at
once
went
to
open
the
little
door
communicating
with
the
road
and
then
he
led
her
into
his
closed
room
where
a
lamp
was
burning
peacefully
but
on
looking
at
her
he
was
seized
with
terrible
anxiety
for
her
garments
were
in
disorder
and
her
face
was
bruised
heavens
what
is
the
matter
josine
what
has
happened
he
cried
tears
were
falling
from
her
eyes
her
hair
drooped
about
her
delicate
white
neck
and
the
collar
of
her
gown
was
torn
away
monsieur
luc
i
wanted
to
see
you
she
began
is
because
he
beat
me
again
when
he
came
home
but
on
account
of
the
threats
he
made
it
necessary
you
should
know
of
them
this
very
evening
then
she
related
that
ragu
on
learning
what
had
happened
in
the
rue
de
brias
the
ignominious
manner
in
which
governor
as
he
called
luc
had
been
escorted
out
of
the
town
had
gone
off
to
leading
bourron
and
others
astray
with
him
and
he
had
but
lately
returned
home
drunk
of
course
and
shouting
that
he
had
had
quite
enough
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
would
not
stop
a
day
longer
in
a
dirty
den
where
one
was
bored
to
death
and
had
not
even
the
right
to
drink
a
drop
too
much
if
one
wanted
to
at
last
after
jeering
and
laughing
and
indulging
in
all
sorts
of
foul
language
he
had
wished
to
compel
her
josine
to
pack
up
their
clothes
at
once
in
order
that
they
might
go
off
in
the
morning
to
the
abyss
where
all
the
hands
leaving
la
crÃªcherie
were
readily
taken
on
and
as
she
had
desired
him
to
pause
before
coming
to
such
a
decision
he
had
ended
by
beating
her
and
turning
her
out
of
the
house
i
do
count
monsieur
luc
she
continued
you
who
are
insulted
and
whom
they
want
to
injure
ragu
will
certainly
go
off
in
the
morning
nothing
can
restrain
him
and
he
will
certainly
carry
off
bourron
as
well
as
five
or
six
others
whom
he
did
name
to
me
for
my
part
i
ca
help
it
but
i
shall
have
to
follow
him
and
it
all
grieves
me
so
much
that
i
felt
i
must
tell
it
you
at
once
for
fear
lest
i
might
never
see
you
again
luc
was
still
looking
at
her
and
a
wave
of
bitterness
submerged
his
heart
was
the
disaster
even
greater
then
than
he
had
supposed
his
workmen
now
were
leaving
him
returning
to
the
hard
toil
and
filthy
wretchedness
of
former
times
seized
with
nostalgia
for
the
hell
whence
he
had
so
laboriously
striven
to
extricate
them
in
four
years
he
had
won
naught
of
their
minds
or
their
affection
and
the
worst
was
that
josine
was
no
happier
she
now
came
back
to
him
as
on
the
first
day
insulted
beaten
cast
into
the
street
thus
nothing
was
done
and
everything
remained
to
be
done
for
did
not
josine
personify
the
suffering
people
it
was
only
on
that
evening
when
he
had
met
her
and
abandoned
a
victim
of
accursed
toil
imposed
on
human
kind
like
slavery
that
he
had
yielded
to
his
desires
to
act
she
was
the
most
humble
the
lowest
the
nearest
to
the
gutter
and
she
was
also
the
most
beautiful
the
gentlest
the
saintliest
ah
as
long
as
woman
should
suffer
the
world
would
not
be
saved
josine
josine
how
grieved
i
am
for
you
how
i
pity
you
he
murmured
with
infinite
tenderness
whilst
he
also
began
to
weep
when
she
saw
his
tears
thus
falling
she
suffered
yet
more
grievously
than
before
what
he
was
weeping
thus
bitterly
he
her
god
he
whom
she
adored
like
some
superior
power
in
gratitude
for
all
the
help
he
had
brought
her
the
joy
with
which
he
had
henceforth
filled
her
life
the
thought
too
of
the
outrages
that
he
had
undergone
that
awful
ascent
of
the
rue
de
brias
increased
her
adoration
drew
her
near
to
him
as
with
a
desire
to
dress
his
wounds
what
could
she
do
to
comfort
him
how
could
she
efface
from
his
face
the
insult
spat
upon
him
enable
him
to
feel
himself
respected
admired
and
worshipped
monsieur
luc
said
she
do
not
know
how
grieved
i
am
at
seeing
you
so
unhappy
and
how
i
should
like
to
relieve
your
sorrows
a
little
they
were
so
near
together
that
the
warmth
of
their
breath
passed
over
their
faces
and
their
mutual
compassion
filled
them
with
increasing
tenderness
how
she
suffered
how
he
suffered
and
he
only
thought
of
her
even
as
she
only
thought
of
him
with
immensity
of
pity
and
a
craving
for
love
and
felicity
am
not
to
be
pitied
said
luc
at
last
is
only
you
josine
whose
suffering
is
a
crime
and
whom
i
must
save
no
monsieur
luc
i
do
not
count
it
is
you
who
ought
not
to
suffer
for
you
are
the
providence
of
us
all
then
as
she
let
herself
sink
into
his
arms
he
clasped
her
passionately
to
his
breast
it
was
a
crisis
not
to
be
resisted
the
mingling
of
two
flames
in
order
that
they
might
henceforth
become
but
one
sole
flame
of
affection
and
strength
thus
was
their
destiny
accomplished
all
had
led
them
to
it
a
sudden
vision
appeared
to
them
of
their
love
born
one
stormy
evening
then
slowly
growing
in
intensity
in
the
depths
of
their
hearts
nothing
henceforth
could
part
them
they
were
two
beings
meeting
in
a
kiss
attaining
to
florescence
no
remorse
was
possible
they
loved
even
as
they
existed
in
order
that
they
might
be
healthy
and
strong
and
fruitful
and
as
luc
sat
in
that
quiet
chamber
with
josine
he
became
conscious
that
a
great
help
had
suddenly
come
to
him
love
alone
could
create
harmony
in
the
city
he
dreamed
of
josine
was
his
and
his
union
with
the
disinherited
was
thereby
sealed
apostle
that
he
was
of
a
new
creed
he
felt
that
he
had
need
of
a
woman
to
help
him
to
redeem
mankind
the
poor
little
beaten
workgirl
whom
he
had
met
one
evening
dying
of
starvation
had
now
for
him
become
a
very
queen
she
had
known
the
uttermost
depths
and
she
would
help
him
to
create
a
new
world
of
splendour
and
joy
she
was
the
only
one
whose
help
he
needed
to
complete
his
task
me
your
hand
your
poor
injured
hand
josine
he
gently
said
to
her
she
gave
it
him
it
was
the
hand
which
had
been
caught
in
some
machinery
and
the
forefinger
of
which
had
been
cut
off
is
very
ugly
she
murmured
josine
oh
no
it
is
so
dear
to
me
that
i
kiss
it
with
devotion
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
scar
left
by
the
injury
he
covered
the
poor
slender
maimed
hand
with
caresses
luc
she
cried
you
love
me
and
how
i
love
you
as
that
cry
of
happiness
and
hope
rang
out
they
once
more
flung
their
arms
around
each
other
necks
outside
over
the
heavy
sleep
of
beauclair
sped
the
thuds
of
the
clang
of
steel
coming
from
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
abyss
both
working
competing
one
with
the
other
through
the
night
and
doubtless
the
war
was
not
yet
over
the
terrible
battle
between
yesterday
and
was
destined
to
become
fiercer
still
but
in
the
midst
of
all
the
torture
there
had
come
a
halt
of
happiness
and
whatever
sufferings
might
lie
ahead
love
at
least
was
sown
for
the
harvest
of
the
future
all
who
remember
zola
trial
in
paris
in
connection
with
the
dreyfus
case
will
recognise
that
the
above
passages
and
others
in
this
chapter
are
in
part
founded
on
his
personal
experiences
at
the
time
referred
iii
from
that
time
forward
at
each
fresh
disaster
which
fell
upon
la
crÃªcherie
when
men
refused
to
follow
luc
or
impeded
him
in
his
endeavours
to
establish
a
community
of
work
justice
and
peace
he
invariably
exclaimed
they
do
love
if
they
only
loved
all
would
prove
fruitful
all
would
grow
and
triumph
in
the
sunlight
his
work
had
reached
the
torturing
hour
of
regression
that
hour
when
in
every
forward
march
there
comes
a
struggle
a
forced
halt
one
ceases
to
advance
one
even
recedes
the
ground
that
has
been
gained
seems
to
crumble
away
and
it
appears
even
as
if
one
would
never
reach
one
goal
and
this
too
is
the
hour
when
with
firmness
of
mind
and
unconquerable
faith
in
final
victory
heroes
make
themselves
manifest
luc
strove
to
restrain
ragu
when
he
found
him
desirous
of
withdrawing
from
the
association
and
returning
to
the
abyss
but
he
was
confronted
by
an
evilly
disposed
ranter
one
who
felt
happy
in
doing
wrong
since
defection
on
the
part
of
the
men
might
ruin
the
new
works
besides
there
was
something
deeper
in
ragu
case
a
form
of
nostalgia
a
craving
to
return
to
slavish
labour
and
black
misery
all
that
horrid
past
which
he
carried
with
him
in
his
blood
in
the
warm
sunlight
amidst
the
gay
cleanliness
of
his
little
home
girt
round
with
verdure
he
had
ever
regretted
the
narrow
streets
of
old
beauclair
the
soiled
hovels
through
which
swept
a
pestilential
atmosphere
whenever
he
spent
an
hour
in
the
large
clear
hall
of
the
where
alcohol
was
not
allowed
he
was
haunted
by
the
acrid
smells
of
caffiaux
tavern
even
the
orderly
manner
in
which
the
stores
were
now
managed
angered
him
and
prompted
him
to
spend
his
money
after
his
own
fashion
with
the
dealers
of
the
rue
de
brias
whom
he
himself
called
thieves
but
with
whom
he
at
least
had
the
pleasure
of
quarrelling
and
the
more
luc
insisted
pointing
out
how
senseless
was
his
departure
the
more
stubborn
did
ragu
become
full
of
the
idea
that
if
such
efforts
were
made
to
retain
him
it
must
be
because
his
departure
would
deal
the
works
a
severe
blow
no
monsieur
luc
said
he
no
arrangement
possible
perhaps
i
am
acting
stupidly
though
i
do
think
so
you
promised
us
all
sorts
of
marvels
we
were
all
to
become
rich
men
but
the
truth
is
that
we
do
earn
more
than
elsewhere
and
that
we
have
additional
worries
that
are
not
at
all
to
my
taste
it
was
indeed
a
fact
that
the
shares
in
the
profits
made
at
la
crÃªcherie
had
so
far
amounted
to
little
more
than
the
salaries
earned
at
the
abyss
but
luc
made
haste
to
answer
live
and
is
it
not
everything
to
live
when
the
future
is
certain
if
i
have
asked
sacrifices
of
you
it
has
been
in
the
conviction
that
happiness
lies
at
the
end
but
patience
and
courage
are
certainly
necessary
together
with
faith
in
the
task
and
a
great
deal
of
work
also
such
language
was
not
of
a
nature
to
influence
ragu
one
expression
alone
had
struck
him
everybody
happiness
he
said
jeeringly
very
pretty
only
i
prefer
to
begin
by
my
own
luc
then
told
him
that
he
was
free
that
his
account
would
be
settled
and
that
he
might
leave
when
he
pleased
after
all
he
had
no
interest
in
retaining
a
malicious
man
whose
evil
disposition
might
prove
fatally
contagious
but
the
thought
of
josine
departure
wrung
heart
and
he
felt
slightly
ashamed
when
he
realised
that
he
had
only
shown
so
much
warmth
in
seeking
to
retain
ragu
at
la
crÃªcherie
because
he
wished
to
retain
her
there
the
thought
that
she
would
go
back
to
live
amidst
the
filth
of
old
beauclair
with
that
man
who
relapsing
into
his
passion
for
drink
would
assuredly
treat
her
with
violence
was
unbearable
to
luc
he
pictured
her
once
more
in
the
rue
des
trois
lunes
in
a
filthy
room
a
prey
to
sordid
deadly
misery
and
he
would
no
longer
be
near
to
watch
over
her
yet
she
was
his
now
and
he
would
have
liked
to
have
had
her
always
with
him
in
order
to
render
her
life
a
happy
one
on
the
following
night
she
came
back
to
see
him
and
there
was
then
a
scene
between
them
tears
vows
wild
suggestions
and
plans
but
reason
prevailed
it
was
needful
that
they
should
accept
facts
as
they
were
if
they
did
not
wish
to
compromise
the
success
of
the
work
which
was
now
common
to
both
of
them
josine
would
follow
ragu
since
she
could
not
refuse
to
do
so
without
raising
a
dangerous
scandal
whilst
luc
at
la
crÃªcherie
would
continue
battling
for
everybody
happiness
in
the
conviction
that
victory
would
some
day
unite
them
they
were
strong
since
love
the
invincible
was
with
them
she
promised
that
she
would
come
back
to
see
him
nevertheless
how
painful
was
the
rending
when
she
bade
him
and
when
on
the
morrow
he
saw
her
quit
la
crÃªcherie
walking
behind
ragu
who
with
bourron
was
pushing
a
little
containing
their
few
chattels
three
days
later
bourron
followed
ragu
whom
he
had
met
each
evening
at
caffiaux
his
mate
had
joked
to
such
a
degree
about
the
of
the
that
he
fancied
he
was
acting
as
became
a
free
man
when
in
his
turn
he
again
went
to
live
in
the
rue
des
trois
lunes
his
wife
babette
after
at
first
attempting
to
prevent
such
foolish
conduct
ended
by
resigning
herself
to
it
with
all
her
usual
gaiety
things
would
go
on
right
enough
for
her
husband
was
a
good
fellow
at
bottom
and
sooner
or
later
would
see
things
clearly
thereupon
she
laughed
and
moved
her
goods
simply
saying
to
her
neighbours
for
she
could
not
believe
that
she
would
never
return
to
those
pretty
gardens
which
she
had
found
so
pleasant
she
particularly
hoped
to
bring
back
her
daughter
marthe
and
her
son
sÃ©bastien
who
were
making
so
much
progress
at
the
schools
and
sÅurette
having
spoken
of
keeping
them
there
she
consented
to
it
however
the
situation
at
la
crÃªcherie
became
yet
worse
for
other
workmen
yielded
to
the
contagion
of
bad
example
by
taking
themselves
off
in
the
same
fashion
as
bourron
and
ragu
had
done
they
lacked
faith
quite
as
much
as
love
and
luc
found
himself
battling
with
human
bad
will
cowardice
defection
in
various
forms
such
as
one
always
encounters
when
one
works
for
the
happiness
of
others
he
felt
that
even
bonnaire
always
so
reasonable
and
loyal
was
secretly
shaken
his
home
was
troubled
by
the
daily
quarrels
picked
by
his
wife
la
toupe
whose
vanity
remained
unsatisfied
for
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
buy
either
the
silk
gown
or
the
watch
which
she
had
been
coveting
ever
since
her
youth
besides
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
regret
that
they
have
not
been
born
princesses
and
thus
ideas
of
equality
and
of
a
community
of
interests
angered
her
she
kept
a
hurricane
perpetually
blowing
in
the
house
rationed
out
daddy
lunot
tobacco
more
gingerly
than
ever
and
was
for
ever
hustling
her
children
lucien
and
antoinette
two
more
had
been
born
to
her
zoÃ©
and
sÃ©verin
and
this
again
she
regarded
as
a
disaster
for
ever
complaining
of
it
to
her
husband
bonnaire
however
remained
very
calm
he
was
accustomed
to
those
storms
and
they
simply
saddened
him
he
did
not
even
answer
when
she
shouted
to
him
that
he
was
a
poor
beast
a
mere
dupe
who
would
end
by
leaving
his
bones
at
la
crÃªcherie
all
the
same
luc
fully
perceived
that
bonnaire
was
scarcely
with
him
the
man
never
allowed
himself
to
speak
a
word
of
censure
he
remained
an
active
punctual
conscientious
worker
setting
a
good
example
to
all
his
mates
but
in
spite
of
this
there
was
disapproval
almost
lassitude
and
discouragement
in
his
demeanour
luc
suffered
greatly
from
it
he
felt
something
like
despair
on
finding
such
a
man
whose
heroism
he
knew
and
for
whom
he
had
so
much
esteem
drifting
away
so
soon
if
he
bonnaire
was
losing
faith
could
it
be
that
the
work
was
bad
they
had
an
explanation
on
the
subject
one
evening
whilst
seated
on
a
bench
at
the
door
of
the
workshops
they
had
met
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
in
a
quiet
sky
and
sitting
down
they
talked
together
is
quite
true
monsieur
said
bonnaire
frankly
in
reply
to
a
question
from
luc
have
great
doubts
about
your
success
besides
you
will
remember
that
i
never
quite
shared
your
ideas
and
that
your
attempt
seemed
to
me
regrettable
on
account
of
the
concessions
you
made
if
i
joined
in
it
it
was
so
to
say
by
way
of
experiment
but
the
further
things
go
the
more
i
see
that
i
was
wrong
the
experiment
is
made
now
and
something
else
revolutionary
action
will
have
to
be
attempted
the
experiment
made
exclaimed
luc
we
are
only
beginning
it
it
will
require
years
several
lifetimes
possibly
it
may
be
a
effort
of
will
and
courage
and
it
is
you
my
friend
you
a
man
of
energy
and
bravery
who
begin
to
doubt
at
this
stage
as
he
spoke
luc
gazed
at
bonnaire
with
his
giant
build
and
broad
peaceful
face
on
which
one
read
so
much
honest
strength
but
the
man
gently
shook
his
head
no
said
he
and
courage
will
do
nothing
it
your
method
which
is
too
gentle
which
places
too
much
reliance
on
men
wisdom
your
association
of
capital
talent
and
work
will
go
on
always
at
a
without
establishing
anything
substantial
and
final
the
fact
is
the
evil
has
reached
such
a
degree
of
abomination
that
one
can
only
heal
it
by
applying
a
iron
what
ought
one
to
do
my
friend
is
necessary
that
the
people
should
at
once
seize
all
the
implements
of
labour
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
dispossess
the
class
and
dispose
of
all
the
capital
itself
in
order
to
organise
compulsory
universal
work
once
more
did
bonnaire
explain
his
ideas
he
had
remained
entirely
on
the
side
of
collectivism
and
luc
who
listened
sorrowfully
felt
astonished
that
he
had
in
no
wise
won
over
that
thoughtful
but
rather
obtuse
mind
even
as
he
had
heard
him
speaking
in
the
rue
des
trois
lunes
on
the
night
when
he
had
quitted
the
abyss
so
did
he
find
him
speaking
now
still
holding
to
the
same
revolutionary
conceptions
his
faith
in
no
degree
modified
by
the
five
years
which
he
had
spent
at
la
crÃªcherie
he
held
evolution
to
be
too
slow
saying
that
progress
merely
by
association
would
demand
far
too
many
years
for
realisation
and
he
was
weary
of
such
an
attempt
and
only
believed
in
immediate
and
violent
revolution
shall
never
be
given
what
we
do
take
said
he
by
way
of
conclusion
have
everything
we
must
take
everything
silence
fell
the
sun
had
set
and
the
night
shifts
had
started
work
in
the
resounding
galleries
luc
whilst
listening
to
those
renewed
efforts
of
labour
could
feel
an
indescribable
sadness
stealing
over
him
as
he
foresaw
that
his
work
would
be
compromised
by
the
eager
haste
of
even
the
best
to
bring
about
their
social
ideal
indeed
was
it
not
often
the
furious
battling
of
ideas
which
hindered
and
retarded
the
realisation
of
facts
wo
argue
with
you
again
my
friend
he
at
last
replied
do
think
that
any
decisive
revolution
is
possible
or
likely
to
give
good
results
in
the
circumstances
in
which
we
find
ourselves
and
i
am
convinced
that
association
and
offer
the
preferable
road
one
along
which
progress
may
be
slow
but
which
will
all
the
same
end
by
leading
us
to
the
promised
city
we
have
often
talked
of
those
matters
without
altogether
agreeing
so
what
use
would
it
be
to
begin
afresh
and
thereby
sadden
ourselves
one
thing
that
i
do
hope
of
you
is
that
in
the
difficulties
through
which
we
are
passing
you
will
remain
faithful
to
the
enterprise
we
founded
together
bonnaire
made
a
sudden
gesture
of
annoyance
monsieur
luc
he
exclaimed
you
doubted
me
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
not
a
traitor
and
that
since
you
one
day
saved
me
from
starving
i
ready
to
eat
my
dry
bread
with
you
as
long
as
may
be
necessary
do
be
anxious
i
never
say
to
others
what
i
just
said
to
you
those
are
matters
between
you
and
me
naturally
i
not
going
to
discourage
our
men
here
by
announcing
that
we
shall
soon
be
ruined
we
are
associated
and
we
will
remain
associated
until
the
walls
fall
down
on
our
heads
greatly
moved
luc
pressed
both
his
hands
and
during
the
ensuing
week
he
witnessed
a
scene
in
the
hall
where
the
was
installed
which
touched
him
even
more
he
had
been
warned
that
two
or
three
fellows
wished
to
follow
ragu
example
and
carry
off
with
them
as
many
of
their
mates
as
possible
just
as
he
was
arriving
to
restore
order
however
he
saw
bonnaire
intervening
vehemently
in
the
midst
of
the
mutineers
he
thereupon
stopped
short
and
listened
bonnaire
was
saying
precisely
what
it
was
requisite
one
should
say
in
such
a
difficulty
recalling
the
benefits
that
had
come
from
the
works
and
calming
the
anxiety
of
his
mates
by
promises
of
a
better
future
provided
that
they
all
worked
bravely
he
looked
so
superb
so
handsome
and
spoke
so
well
that
the
others
speedily
became
quiet
influenced
by
the
fact
that
one
of
themselves
had
used
such
sensible
arguments
none
spoke
any
further
of
quitting
the
association
and
thus
defection
was
stopped
luc
could
never
forget
that
spectacle
of
bonnaire
pacifying
his
revolted
comrades
with
the
broad
gestures
of
a
good
giant
the
courage
of
a
hero
of
work
full
of
respect
for
freely
accepted
toil
since
they
were
fighting
for
the
happiness
of
all
he
would
indeed
have
thought
himself
a
coward
had
he
deserted
his
post
even
though
he
was
of
opinion
that
they
ought
to
have
fought
the
battle
in
another
manner
when
luc
however
expressed
his
thanks
he
was
again
distressed
by
this
quiet
reply
was
simple
enough
said
bonnaire
merely
did
what
it
was
my
duty
to
do
all
the
same
monsieur
luc
i
shall
have
to
bring
you
round
to
my
ideas
for
otherwise
we
shall
all
end
by
dying
of
starvation
here
a
few
days
later
luc
gloom
was
increased
by
another
conversation
he
was
coming
down
from
the
smeltery
with
bonnaire
as
it
happened
when
the
pair
of
them
passed
before
the
kilns
of
lange
the
potter
who
obstinately
clung
to
the
narrow
strip
of
land
which
had
been
left
him
beside
the
rocky
ridge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
and
which
he
had
enclosed
with
a
little
wall
of
stones
in
vain
had
luc
proposed
to
take
him
on
at
la
crÃªcherie
offering
him
the
management
of
a
department
which
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
establish
lange
reply
was
that
he
wished
to
remain
free
either
god
or
master
so
he
continued
dwelling
in
his
wild
den
and
making
common
pottery
pans
and
pitchers
which
he
afterwards
carted
to
the
markets
and
fairs
of
the
neighbouring
villages
he
himself
drawing
the
cart
whilst
barefeet
pushed
it
from
behind
that
evening
as
it
happened
they
were
returning
together
from
one
of
their
rounds
when
luc
and
bonnaire
passed
before
their
little
enclosure
lange
is
business
prospering
the
young
man
cordially
inquired
always
well
enough
to
give
us
bread
monsieur
luc
as
aware
that
is
all
that
i
ask
for
answered
lange
indeed
he
only
carted
his
wares
about
when
bread
was
lacking
in
his
home
throughout
his
spare
time
he
lingered
over
pottery
which
was
not
intended
for
sale
remaining
for
hours
in
contemplation
of
the
things
he
thus
made
his
eyes
having
the
dreamy
expression
of
those
of
some
rustic
poet
full
of
a
passion
to
impart
life
to
things
even
the
coarse
goods
which
he
fashioned
his
very
pans
and
displayed
a
and
purity
of
lines
a
proud
and
simple
gracefulness
which
bespoke
poetic
fancy
a
son
of
the
people
as
he
was
he
had
instinctively
lighted
upon
the
old
primitive
popular
beauty
that
beauty
of
the
humble
domestic
utensil
which
arises
from
perfection
of
proportions
and
absolute
adaptability
to
the
uses
to
which
the
utensil
is
intended
to
be
put
luc
was
struck
by
that
beauty
on
examining
a
few
unsold
pieces
in
the
little
and
the
sight
of
barefeet
that
tall
dark
comely
girl
with
the
strong
slender
limbs
of
a
wrestler
and
the
firm
bosom
of
an
amazon
likewise
filled
him
with
mingled
admiration
and
astonishment
is
hard
to
push
that
along
all
day
is
it
he
said
to
her
but
she
was
a
silent
creature
and
contented
herself
with
smiling
with
her
big
wild
eyes
whilst
the
potter
answered
in
her
stead
we
rest
in
the
shade
by
the
wayside
when
we
come
upon
a
spring
said
he
are
all
right
are
they
barefeet
and
we
are
happy
the
young
woman
had
turned
her
eyes
on
him
and
they
glowed
with
boundless
adoration
as
for
some
beloved
powerful
benign
master
a
saviour
a
god
then
without
a
word
she
pushed
the
little
into
the
enclosure
and
set
it
in
place
under
a
shed
lange
on
his
side
had
watched
her
with
a
glance
of
deep
affection
at
times
he
feigned
some
roughness
as
if
he
still
regarded
her
as
a
mere
gipsy
picked
up
by
the
wayside
but
truth
to
tell
she
was
now
the
mistress
he
loved
her
with
a
passion
which
he
did
not
confess
which
he
hid
beneath
the
demeanour
of
an
uncouth
peasant
in
point
of
fact
that
little
man
with
head
bushy
with
a
tangle
of
hair
and
beard
was
of
a
very
gentle
and
amorous
nature
all
at
once
again
turning
towards
luc
whom
he
affected
to
treat
as
a
he
said
to
him
in
his
rough
frank
way
everybody
happiness
getting
on
then
are
those
idiots
who
consent
to
shut
themselves
up
in
your
barracks
willing
to
be
happy
in
the
fashion
you
want
each
time
that
he
met
luc
he
thus
jeered
at
the
attempt
at
fourierist
communism
which
was
being
made
at
la
crÃªcherie
and
as
the
young
man
contented
himself
with
smiling
he
added
hoping
that
before
another
six
months
have
gone
by
you
be
with
us
the
anarchists
i
tell
you
once
again
that
everything
is
rotten
and
that
the
only
thing
is
to
blow
old
society
to
pieces
with
bombs
at
this
bonnaire
hitherto
silent
abruptly
intervened
with
bombs
that
idiotic
he
a
pure
collectivist
was
not
in
favour
of
crime
so
called
by
deeds
although
he
believed
in
the
necessity
of
a
general
and
violent
revolution
idiotic
cried
lange
who
felt
hurt
you
imagine
that
if
the
are
not
properly
prepared
for
it
your
famous
socialisation
of
the
instruments
of
labour
will
ever
take
place
your
disguised
capitalism
which
is
idiotic
just
begin
by
destroying
everything
so
as
to
have
the
ground
clear
for
building
up
things
properly
they
went
on
arguing
the
anarchism
of
one
contending
with
the
collectivism
of
the
other
and
luc
remained
listening
to
them
the
distance
between
lange
and
bonnaire
he
noticed
was
as
great
as
the
distance
between
bonnaire
and
himself
by
the
extreme
bitterness
of
their
dispute
one
might
have
taken
them
to
be
men
of
different
races
hereditary
enemies
ready
to
devour
one
another
and
beyond
all
possibility
of
agreement
yet
they
desired
the
very
same
happiness
for
one
and
all
they
met
at
the
very
same
point
justice
peace
and
a
reorganisation
of
work
giving
bread
and
joy
to
all
but
what
fury
what
aggressive
deadly
hatred
became
manifest
on
either
side
as
soon
as
there
was
a
question
of
agreeing
on
the
means
to
be
employed
to
attain
that
end
all
along
the
rough
road
of
progress
at
each
halt
the
brothers
on
the
march
one
and
all
inflamed
by
the
same
desire
for
enfranchisement
waged
bloody
battles
together
on
the
simple
question
whether
they
would
do
best
to
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
all
each
of
us
is
his
own
master
lange
ended
by
declaring
to
sleep
in
your
niche
if
it
amuses
you
mate
i
know
what
i
myself
have
got
to
do
they
are
getting
on
they
are
getting
on
those
little
presents
of
mine
those
little
pots
which
we
shall
deposit
some
fine
morning
at
the
the
mayor
the
judge
and
the
parson
is
that
so
barefeet
we
shall
have
a
fine
round
that
morning
ah
sha
we
push
our
cart
on
gaily
the
tall
and
beautiful
girl
had
now
returned
to
the
threshold
and
stood
out
sculpturally
in
sovereign
fashion
amongst
the
ruddy
clay
of
the
little
enclosure
her
eyes
again
blazed
and
she
smiled
like
one
who
is
all
submission
ready
to
follow
her
master
to
the
point
of
crime
belongs
to
it
mate
added
lange
in
all
simplicity
helps
me
when
luc
and
bonnaire
had
quitted
him
without
any
show
of
animosity
on
either
side
though
they
agreed
together
so
little
they
walked
on
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
then
bonnaire
felt
a
desire
to
renew
his
argument
and
demonstrate
yet
once
again
that
no
salvation
was
possible
outside
of
the
collectivist
faith
he
anathematised
the
anarchists
even
as
he
anathematised
the
fourierists
the
latter
because
they
did
not
immediately
possess
themselves
of
the
capital
now
in
the
hands
of
the
the
former
because
they
suppressed
it
by
violence
and
it
again
appeared
to
luc
that
reconciliation
would
only
be
possible
when
the
future
community
should
be
founded
for
then
in
presence
of
the
realisation
of
the
common
dream
all
sects
would
necessarily
be
contented
but
what
a
long
road
yet
remained
to
be
travelled
and
how
grievously
he
feared
lest
his
brothers
should
devour
one
another
on
the
way
he
returned
home
saddened
by
all
that
constant
clashing
which
impeded
the
progress
of
his
work
no
sooner
apparently
had
two
men
resolved
to
act
than
they
began
to
disagree
then
on
finding
himself
alone
the
cry
which
ever
inflated
luc
heart
burst
forth
from
him
they
do
not
love
if
they
loved
all
would
prove
fruitful
and
grow
and
triumph
in
the
sunlight
morfain
was
also
now
causing
the
young
man
a
deal
of
worry
in
vain
had
he
tried
to
civilise
the
smelter
by
offering
him
one
of
the
gay
little
houses
of
la
crÃªcherie
if
he
would
only
quit
his
cave
in
the
rocks
the
other
stubbornly
refused
on
the
pretext
that
up
yonder
he
was
near
his
work
and
able
to
watch
over
it
unceasingly
luc
had
now
confided
to
him
the
whole
management
of
the
smeltery
which
worked
on
in
the
ancient
fashion
pending
the
invention
of
those
electrical
furnaces
which
jordan
never
wearying
was
still
striving
to
devise
however
the
real
cause
of
morfain
obstinacy
in
refusing
to
come
down
and
dwell
among
the
men
peopling
the
new
town
was
the
disdain
the
hatred
almost
with
which
he
regarded
them
he
who
personified
the
vulcan
of
the
primitive
days
a
tamer
of
fire
later
on
crushed
down
by
prolonged
slavery
toiling
with
heroic
resignation
and
ending
by
loving
the
sombre
grandeur
of
the
inferno
in
which
fate
kept
him
felt
irritated
with
those
new
works
where
toilers
were
to
become
gentlemen
using
their
arms
but
sparingly
since
they
would
be
replaced
by
machinery
which
mere
children
would
soon
know
how
to
drive
that
desire
to
toil
as
little
as
possible
to
cease
battling
personally
with
fire
and
iron
seemed
to
morfain
abject
and
wretched
he
could
not
even
understand
it
but
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
whenever
he
thought
of
it
during
his
long
days
of
silence
and
alone
and
proud
he
remained
on
his
reigning
over
the
smeltery
and
looking
down
upon
the
new
works
which
the
dazzling
flow
of
liquid
metal
crowned
as
with
flames
four
times
every
hours
but
there
was
yet
another
reason
which
angered
morfain
with
those
new
times
which
he
wished
to
ignore
and
this
was
a
reason
which
must
have
made
the
heart
of
the
taciturn
smelter
bleed
frightfully
his
daughter
whose
blue
eyes
were
to
him
like
the
blue
of
heaven
that
tall
and
beautiful
creature
who
since
her
mother
death
had
worked
as
the
housewife
of
the
wild
home
had
become
morfain
flew
into
a
rage
when
he
discovered
it
and
then
forgave
her
saying
to
himself
that
she
would
assuredly
some
day
have
got
married
but
forgiveness
was
suddenly
recalled
and
became
impossible
when
his
daughter
gave
him
her
lover
name
that
of
achille
gourier
the
son
of
the
mayor
of
beauclair
the
intrigue
had
been
going
on
for
years
now
amidst
the
evening
breezes
under
the
starry
sky
along
the
paths
of
the
bleuse
mountains
and
over
their
rocks
and
patches
of
thyme
and
lavender
achille
breaking
off
all
intercourse
with
his
family
like
a
young
whom
the
bored
and
disgusted
had
at
last
begged
luc
to
take
him
on
at
la
crÃªcherie
where
he
had
become
a
designer
he
thus
severed
every
tie
connecting
him
with
his
former
life
he
lived
as
he
listed
resolved
to
toil
for
her
whom
he
had
chosen
like
a
scion
of
the
old
condemned
social
system
whom
evolution
led
towards
the
new
age
what
angered
morfain
to
such
a
point
that
he
drove
his
daughter
from
home
was
precisely
the
fact
that
she
had
suffered
herself
to
be
led
astray
by
a
in
such
wise
that
to
him
there
seemed
naught
but
rebellion
and
devilry
in
her
conduct
the
whole
antique
edifice
must
be
tumbling
to
pieces
since
so
good
and
beautiful
a
girl
had
shaken
it
by
listening
to
and
perhaps
even
angling
for
the
son
of
the
mayor
as
on
being
turned
out
of
doors
naturally
sought
a
refuge
with
achille
luc
was
compelled
to
intervene
the
young
people
did
not
even
speak
of
marriage
what
was
the
use
of
any
such
ceremony
since
they
were
quite
sure
that
they
loved
one
another
and
would
never
part
besides
in
order
to
get
married
achille
would
have
had
to
address
summonses
to
his
father
and
this
seemed
to
him
useless
and
vexatious
trouble
in
vain
did
sÅurette
insist
on
the
matter
in
the
idea
that
morality
and
the
good
repute
of
la
crÃªcherie
still
required
that
there
should
be
a
legal
marriage
luc
ended
by
prevailing
on
her
to
close
her
eyes
for
he
felt
that
with
the
new
generations
one
would
be
gradually
compelled
to
accept
the
principle
of
free
union
morfain
however
did
not
consent
to
the
position
so
readily
and
luc
had
to
go
up
one
evening
to
reason
with
him
since
he
had
driven
his
daughter
away
the
lived
alone
with
his
son
and
between
them
they
cooked
their
meals
and
attended
to
the
various
household
duties
in
their
rocky
cave
that
evening
after
partaking
of
some
soup
they
had
remained
seated
on
their
stools
at
the
table
which
they
had
made
themselves
while
the
little
lamp
which
lighted
them
threw
the
shadows
of
their
burly
figures
upon
the
smoky
stone
walls
the
world
advances
father
was
saying
remain
motionless
morfain
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
and
made
it
shake
lived
as
my
father
lived
said
he
your
duty
is
to
live
as
i
do
as
a
rule
the
two
men
scarcely
exchanged
four
words
a
day
but
for
some
time
past
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
had
been
growing
up
between
them
and
although
they
did
all
they
could
to
avert
it
disputes
sometimes
arose
the
son
who
could
read
and
write
was
being
more
and
more
affected
by
the
evolution
of
the
times
which
penetrated
even
to
the
depths
of
the
mountain
gorges
and
the
father
in
his
proud
and
stubborn
determination
to
remain
merely
a
strong
toiler
able
to
subjugate
fire
and
conquer
iron
indulged
in
sorrowful
outbursts
as
if
his
race
were
degenerating
through
all
the
science
and
useless
ideas
of
the
new
era
your
sister
had
read
books
and
had
busied
herself
about
what
went
on
down
below
she
still
be
with
us
said
he
it
was
that
new
town
that
cursed
town
that
took
her
from
us
this
time
he
did
not
strike
the
table
but
thrust
his
fist
through
the
open
doorway
into
the
dark
night
towards
la
crÃªcherie
whose
lights
twinkled
like
stars
below
the
rocky
ridge
did
not
answer
in
part
from
a
sense
of
respect
in
part
because
he
felt
embarrassed
for
he
knew
that
his
father
had
been
displeased
with
him
ever
since
meeting
him
one
day
with
honorine
the
daughter
of
caffiaux
the
honorine
short
slender
and
dark
with
a
gay
face
had
fallen
passionately
in
love
with
that
gentle
young
giant
and
he
for
his
part
thought
her
charming
in
the
discussion
which
had
broken
out
that
evening
between
the
father
and
the
son
the
question
at
bottom
was
really
one
of
honorine
and
thus
the
direct
attack
which
had
all
along
anticipated
ended
by
coming
you
suddenly
said
his
father
are
you
going
to
leave
me
this
idea
of
a
separation
seemed
to
upset
do
you
want
me
to
leave
you
father
he
asked
when
a
girl
in
question
there
can
only
be
quarrels
and
ruin
and
besides
what
girl
have
you
chosen
will
her
people
even
let
you
have
her
is
there
any
sense
in
such
marriages
which
mix
one
class
with
another
and
turn
the
world
it
the
end
of
everything
i
lived
too
long
gently
and
tenderly
his
son
strove
to
pacify
him
the
young
man
did
not
deny
his
love
for
honorine
only
he
spoke
like
a
sensible
lad
who
was
resolved
to
remain
patient
as
long
as
might
be
necessary
they
would
see
about
the
matter
later
on
nevertheless
when
he
and
the
girl
chanced
to
meet
what
harm
could
there
be
in
wishing
one
another
a
friendly
good
day
although
folks
might
not
be
of
the
same
position
that
did
not
always
prevent
them
from
caring
for
one
another
and
even
if
different
classes
were
to
mingle
a
little
would
that
not
have
its
good
side
since
they
would
thus
learn
to
know
each
other
and
esteem
each
other
more
morfain
however
full
of
wrath
and
bitterness
did
not
listen
to
those
arguments
he
suddenly
rose
up
and
with
a
great
tragic
wave
of
his
arm
under
the
rocky
ceiling
which
his
head
almost
touched
he
replied
off
be
off
as
soon
as
you
like
do
as
your
sister
has
done
spit
on
everything
that
respectable
leap
into
shamelessness
and
madness
you
are
no
longer
my
children
i
no
longer
recognise
you
somebody
has
changed
you
so
leave
me
here
alone
in
this
wild
den
where
i
hope
the
rocks
will
soon
fall
down
on
me
and
crush
me
to
death
luc
at
that
moment
just
arriving
paused
on
the
threshold
and
heard
those
last
words
he
was
greatly
affected
by
them
for
he
held
morfain
in
much
esteem
for
a
long
time
he
reasoned
with
him
but
the
smelter
on
the
arrival
of
the
young
man
whom
he
regarded
as
a
master
had
forced
back
his
grief
to
become
once
more
a
mere
workman
a
submissive
subordinate
with
no
thoughts
beyond
his
duties
he
did
not
even
allow
himself
to
judge
luc
although
the
latter
was
the
primary
cause
of
the
abominations
which
were
upsetting
the
region
and
causing
him
so
much
pain
the
masters
after
all
had
a
right
to
act
as
they
pleased
and
it
was
for
the
workmen
to
remain
honest
and
do
their
work
as
their
elders
had
done
it
before
them
not
be
alarmed
monsieur
luc
he
said
i
happen
to
have
some
ideas
of
my
own
and
get
angry
when
i
find
them
thwarted
it
seldom
happens
for
you
know
that
i
no
talker
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
the
work
does
not
suffer
from
it
for
i
always
keep
one
eye
open
and
no
metal
is
ever
run
out
otherwise
than
in
my
presence
after
all
when
one
heart
is
full
one
works
all
the
harder
is
that
so
then
however
as
luc
again
strove
to
make
peace
in
that
unhappy
family
ravaged
by
the
evolution
of
which
he
had
made
himself
the
apostle
the
all
but
flew
into
a
passion
once
more
no
that
enough
let
me
be
if
you
came
up
monsieur
luc
to
speak
to
me
about
you
did
wrong
because
that
the
very
way
to
make
things
worse
let
her
stop
where
she
is
while
i
stop
where
i
am
then
desirous
of
changing
the
conversation
he
brusquely
gave
luc
some
bad
news
which
indeed
had
largely
brought
about
his
fit
of
should
probably
have
gone
down
to
you
he
said
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
went
to
the
mine
again
this
morning
and
that
we
again
been
disappointed
in
our
hope
of
finding
the
rich
vein
yet
i
could
have
sworn
that
it
would
certainly
be
met
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
i
indicated
what
would
you
have
an
evil
spell
seems
to
have
been
cast
over
all
we
have
undertaken
for
some
time
past
nothing
succeeds
those
words
resounded
in
luc
ears
like
the
knell
of
his
great
hopes
he
lingered
for
a
moment
talking
with
the
father
and
the
son
and
then
went
down
the
hillside
again
overcome
by
bitter
sadness
and
wondering
upon
what
mass
of
ruins
he
would
have
to
found
his
city
even
at
la
crÃªcherie
he
encountered
reasons
for
discouragement
sÅurette
still
received
abbÃ©
marle
schoolmaster
hermeline
and
doctor
novarre
and
it
apparently
gave
her
so
much
pleasure
to
have
her
friend
luc
to
lunch
on
those
occasions
that
he
dared
not
decline
her
invitations
in
spite
of
the
secret
discomfort
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
the
everlasting
disputes
of
the
schoolmaster
and
the
priest
sÅurette
whose
mind
was
at
peace
did
not
suffer
from
them
and
even
thought
that
they
interested
luc
whilst
jordan
wrapped
in
his
rugs
and
dreaming
of
some
experiment
which
he
had
begun
seemed
to
listen
with
a
vague
smile
one
tuesday
after
they
had
risen
from
table
the
dispute
in
the
little
became
exceptionally
violent
hermeline
had
tackled
luc
with
respect
to
the
education
which
was
being
given
to
the
children
at
la
crÃªcherie
he
spoke
of
the
boys
and
girls
mingling
in
the
five
classes
of
the
long
intervals
of
play
that
were
allowed
and
of
the
numerous
hours
spent
in
the
workshops
this
new
school
where
methods
diametrically
opposed
to
his
own
were
pursued
had
robbed
him
of
several
of
his
own
pupils
a
thing
which
he
could
not
forgive
and
his
angular
face
with
its
long
brow
and
thin
lips
turned
pale
with
suppressed
rage
at
the
idea
that
anybody
could
believe
otherwise
than
himself
might
consent
to
see
those
boys
and
girls
brought
up
together
said
he
it
seems
to
me
scarcely
proper
for
they
already
evince
an
abundance
of
evil
instincts
when
the
sexes
are
separated
and
the
extraordinary
idea
of
uniting
them
can
only
pervert
them
the
more
but
what
i
hold
to
be
inadmissible
is
that
the
master
authority
is
destroyed
and
discipline
reduced
to
nothingness
did
you
not
tell
me
that
each
pupil
followed
his
own
bent
applied
himself
to
those
studies
which
pleased
him
and
was
free
to
argue
about
his
lessons
you
call
that
raising
energy
it
seems
but
what
can
those
studies
be
when
the
pupils
are
always
at
play
when
books
are
held
in
contempt
when
the
master
word
ceases
to
be
infallible
and
when
the
time
not
spent
in
the
garden
is
spent
in
workshops
planing
wood
or
filing
iron
a
manual
calling
is
a
good
thing
to
learn
no
doubt
but
there
is
a
time
for
everything
and
the
first
thing
is
to
force
as
much
grammar
and
arithmetic
as
possible
into
the
brains
of
all
those
idlers
luc
had
ceased
arguing
weary
as
he
was
of
coming
into
collision
with
the
stubborn
uncompromising
views
of
that
sectarian
who
having
decreed
a
dogma
of
progress
according
to
his
own
lights
refused
to
stir
from
it
thus
the
young
man
quietly
contented
himself
with
replying
we
think
it
necessary
to
render
the
pupils
work
attractive
to
change
classical
studies
into
constant
lessons
of
things
and
our
object
above
all
else
is
to
create
will
to
create
men
hermeline
thereupon
exploded
do
you
know
what
you
will
create
he
cried
will
create
so
many
so
many
rebels
there
is
only
one
way
to
give
citizens
to
the
state
and
that
is
to
make
them
expressly
for
it
such
as
it
needs
them
in
order
to
be
strong
and
glorious
thence
comes
the
necessity
for
discipline
and
a
system
of
education
preparing
according
to
the
programmes
which
are
recognised
as
the
best
the
workmen
the
professional
men
and
the
functionaries
which
the
country
needs
outside
the
pale
of
authority
there
is
no
certainty
for
my
part
i
am
an
old
republican
a
an
atheist
nobody
i
hope
will
ever
picture
me
as
a
man
with
a
retrograde
mind
and
yet
your
system
of
education
sets
me
beside
myself
because
in
half
a
century
with
such
a
system
of
work
there
would
be
no
more
citizens
no
more
soldiers
no
more
patriots
yes
indeed
i
defy
you
to
make
soldiers
of
your
free
men
and
in
that
case
how
could
the
country
defend
itself
in
the
event
of
war
doubt
in
the
event
of
war
it
would
be
necessary
to
defend
it
answered
luc
unmoved
of
what
use
will
soldiers
be
some
day
if
men
no
longer
fight
you
talk
like
captain
jollivet
writes
in
the
journal
de
beauclair
when
he
accuses
us
of
being
traitors
men
without
a
country
this
touch
of
sarcasm
although
slight
brought
hermeline
anger
to
a
climax
jollivet
is
an
idiot
for
whom
i
feel
nothing
but
contempt
said
he
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
you
are
preparing
a
disorderly
generation
in
rebellion
against
the
state
and
one
which
would
assuredly
lead
the
republic
to
the
worst
catastrophes
liberty
all
truth
all
justice
are
catastrophes
said
luc
again
smiling
but
hermeline
went
on
drawing
a
frightful
picture
of
social
system
if
indeed
the
schools
should
cease
to
turn
out
citizens
on
a
given
pattern
for
the
needs
of
his
authoritarian
republic
there
would
be
no
more
political
discipline
no
more
government
possible
no
more
sovereignty
of
the
state
but
in
lieu
thereof
would
come
disorderly
license
leading
to
the
worst
forms
of
corruption
and
debauchery
and
all
at
once
abbÃ©
marle
who
had
been
listening
and
nodding
his
head
approvingly
could
not
resist
an
impulse
to
exclaim
yes
you
are
quite
right
and
all
that
is
put
very
well
indeed
his
broad
full
face
with
its
regular
features
and
aquiline
nose
was
radiant
with
delight
at
that
furious
attack
upon
the
new
society
in
which
he
felt
his
deity
would
be
condemned
regarded
simply
as
the
historical
idol
of
a
dead
religion
he
himself
each
sunday
in
the
pulpit
brought
forward
the
same
accusations
prophesied
the
same
disasters
as
hermeline
but
he
was
scarcely
listened
to
his
church
became
emptier
every
day
and
he
felt
deep
unacknowledged
grief
thereat
confining
himself
more
and
more
as
his
sole
consolation
within
his
narrow
doctrines
never
had
he
shown
himself
more
attached
to
the
letter
of
dogma
never
had
he
inflicted
severer
penance
on
his
penitents
as
if
indeed
he
were
desirous
that
the
world
over
whose
rottenness
he
threw
the
cloak
of
religion
might
at
least
show
a
brave
demeanour
when
it
was
submerged
on
the
day
when
his
church
would
fall
he
at
any
rate
would
be
at
his
altar
and
would
finish
his
last
mass
beneath
the
ruins
is
quite
true
said
he
to
hermeline
the
reign
of
satan
is
near
at
hand
what
with
all
those
lads
and
girls
brought
up
together
every
evil
passion
let
loose
authority
destroyed
the
kingdom
of
god
set
not
in
heaven
but
on
earth
as
in
the
time
of
the
pagans
the
picture
that
you
have
drawn
of
it
all
is
so
correct
that
i
myself
could
add
nothing
stronger
embarrassed
at
being
thus
praised
by
the
priest
with
whom
he
never
agreed
on
anything
the
schoolmaster
suddenly
became
silent
and
gazed
at
the
lawns
of
the
park
as
if
he
did
not
hear
resumed
abbÃ©
marle
addressing
himself
this
time
to
luc
from
the
demoralising
education
given
in
your
schools
there
is
one
thing
that
i
can
not
pardon
which
is
that
you
have
turned
the
divinity
out
of
doors
and
have
voluntarily
neglected
to
build
a
church
in
the
centre
of
your
new
town
among
so
many
handsome
and
useful
edifices
do
you
pretend
then
that
you
can
live
without
god
no
state
hitherto
has
been
able
to
do
so
a
religion
has
always
been
necessary
for
the
government
of
men
pretend
nothing
luc
replied
man
is
free
with
respect
to
his
belief
and
if
no
church
has
been
built
it
is
because
none
of
us
has
yet
felt
the
need
of
one
but
one
can
be
built
should
there
be
faithful
to
attend
it
it
will
always
be
allowable
for
a
group
of
citizens
to
meet
together
for
such
satisfactions
as
may
please
them
and
with
regard
to
the
necessity
of
a
religion
that
is
indeed
a
real
necessity
when
one
desires
to
govern
men
but
we
do
not
desire
to
govern
them
at
all
on
the
contrary
we
wish
them
to
live
free
in
the
free
city
let
me
tell
you
monsieur
it
is
not
we
who
are
destroying
catholicism
it
is
destroying
itself
it
is
dying
slowly
of
old
age
like
all
religions
after
accomplishing
their
historical
task
necessarily
die
at
the
hour
indicated
by
human
evolution
science
destroys
all
dogmas
one
by
one
the
religion
of
humanity
is
born
and
will
conquer
the
world
what
is
the
use
of
a
catholic
church
at
la
crÃªcherie
since
yours
at
beauclair
is
already
too
large
growing
more
and
more
deserted
and
destined
one
of
these
days
to
topple
over
the
priest
was
very
pale
but
he
would
not
understand
with
the
stubbornness
of
a
believer
who
places
his
strength
in
affirmation
without
reason
or
proof
he
contented
himself
with
repeating
god
is
not
with
you
your
defeat
is
certain
believe
me
build
a
church
hermeline
was
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
the
priest
words
of
praise
were
still
suffocating
him
particularly
as
they
had
been
followed
by
that
declaration
of
the
necessity
of
a
religion
no
ah
no
abbÃ©
he
shouted
church
please
i
make
no
concealment
of
the
fact
that
matters
are
hardly
organised
in
the
new
town
in
accordance
with
my
tastes
but
if
there
is
one
thing
that
i
approve
it
is
certainly
the
relinquishment
of
any
state
religion
govern
men
why
yes
only
instead
of
the
priests
in
their
churches
it
is
we
the
citizens
in
our
municipal
buildings
who
will
govern
them
as
for
the
churches
they
will
be
turned
into
public
granaries
barns
for
the
crops
then
as
abbÃ©
marle
losing
his
temper
declared
that
he
would
not
allow
sacrilegious
language
to
be
used
in
his
presence
the
dispute
became
so
bitter
that
doctor
novarre
as
usual
was
forced
to
intervene
he
had
hitherto
listened
to
the
others
with
his
shrewd
air
like
a
gentle
and
somewhat
sceptical
man
who
was
not
put
out
by
any
words
however
violent
that
might
be
exchanged
however
he
fancied
he
could
detect
that
the
dispute
was
beginning
to
pain
sÅurette
come
said
he
almost
agree
since
both
of
you
put
the
churches
to
use
the
abbÃ©
will
always
be
able
to
say
mass
provided
he
leaves
a
little
space
in
his
church
for
the
fruits
of
the
earth
in
years
of
great
abundance
then
the
doctor
went
on
to
speak
of
a
new
rose
that
he
had
just
raised
a
superb
flower
its
outer
petals
very
white
and
pure
and
its
heart
warmed
by
a
pronounced
flush
of
carmine
he
had
brought
a
bunch
of
the
flowers
which
had
been
placed
in
a
vase
on
the
table
and
sÅurette
looking
at
it
smiled
once
more
at
the
sight
of
that
florescence
all
charm
and
perfume
though
she
still
felt
saddened
and
tired
by
the
violence
which
nowadays
marked
the
quarrels
attending
her
tuesday
lunches
if
things
went
on
in
that
fashion
it
would
soon
be
impossible
for
them
to
see
one
another
and
it
was
only
now
that
jordan
emerged
from
his
reverie
he
had
not
ceased
to
appear
attentive
as
if
indeed
he
were
listening
to
the
others
but
he
made
a
remark
which
showed
how
far
away
his
mind
had
been
you
know
exclaimed
he
a
learned
electrician
in
america
has
succeeded
in
storing
enough
solar
heat
to
produce
electricity
when
the
priest
the
schoolmaster
and
the
doctor
had
departed
and
luc
found
himself
alone
with
the
jordans
profound
silence
fell
the
thought
of
all
the
poor
men
who
tore
one
another
and
crushed
one
another
in
their
blind
struggle
for
happiness
rent
the
young
man
heart
as
time
went
by
seeing
with
what
difficulty
one
worked
for
the
common
weal
having
to
contend
against
the
revolts
even
of
those
whom
one
worked
to
save
luc
was
sometimes
seized
with
discouragement
which
he
would
not
as
yet
confess
but
which
left
both
his
limbs
and
his
mind
strengthless
as
after
some
great
useless
exertion
for
a
moment
his
will
would
capsize
and
seem
on
the
point
of
sinking
and
again
that
day
he
raised
his
cry
of
distress
they
do
love
if
they
loved
all
would
prove
fruitful
all
would
grow
and
triumph
in
the
sunlight
a
few
days
later
one
autumn
morning
at
a
very
early
hour
sÅurette
experienced
a
terrible
which
threw
her
into
the
greatest
anguish
she
invariably
rose
betimes
and
that
morning
she
was
going
to
give
some
orders
at
a
dairy
which
she
had
established
for
the
infants
of
her
when
as
she
went
along
the
terrace
which
ended
at
the
pavilion
occupied
by
luc
it
occurred
to
her
to
glance
down
at
the
road
which
the
terrace
overlooked
and
precisely
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
pavilion
opening
into
the
road
was
set
ajar
and
she
saw
a
woman
steal
out
a
woman
of
slender
form
who
immediately
afterwards
disappeared
amidst
the
pinkish
morning
mist
nevertheless
sÅurette
had
time
to
recognise
her
it
was
josine
leaving
luc
at
break
of
day
since
ragu
departure
from
la
crÃªcherie
josine
indeed
had
returned
to
see
luc
every
now
and
then
on
this
occasion
she
had
come
to
tell
him
that
she
should
not
again
return
for
she
feared
lest
she
might
be
surprised
when
leaving
her
home
or
returning
thither
by
some
of
her
inquisitive
neighbours
moreover
the
idea
of
lying
and
hiding
herself
in
order
to
join
the
man
whom
she
regarded
as
a
god
had
become
so
painful
to
her
that
she
preferred
to
await
the
day
when
she
might
proclaim
her
love
aloud
luc
understanding
her
had
resigned
himself
to
this
separation
but
how
full
of
passion
and
despair
was
their
hour
of
farewell
they
lingered
there
exchanging
vows
and
the
daylight
had
already
come
when
josine
was
at
last
able
to
tear
herself
away
only
the
morning
mist
in
some
degree
veiled
her
flitting
though
not
sufficiently
to
prevent
jordan
sister
from
recognising
her
sÅurette
in
the
shock
of
her
discovery
had
stopped
short
rooted
to
the
spot
as
if
she
saw
the
earth
opening
before
her
such
was
her
agitation
such
a
buzzing
filled
her
ears
that
at
first
she
could
not
reason
she
forgot
that
she
was
going
to
the
dairy
to
give
an
order
and
all
at
once
she
fled
retracing
her
steps
at
a
run
returning
to
the
house
and
climbing
wildly
to
her
room
the
door
of
which
she
locked
behind
her
and
then
she
flung
herself
upon
her
bed
striving
to
cover
both
her
eyes
and
her
ears
with
her
hands
so
that
she
might
see
and
hear
nothing
more
she
did
not
weep
she
had
not
recovered
full
consciousness
as
yet
but
a
feeling
of
awful
desolation
blended
with
boundless
fright
filled
her
being
why
did
she
suffer
thus
why
did
she
feel
such
a
rending
within
her
she
had
hitherto
thought
herself
to
be
simply
luc
affectionate
friend
his
disciple
and
helper
one
who
was
passionately
devoted
to
the
work
which
he
was
striving
to
accomplish
yet
now
she
was
all
aglow
shaken
by
burning
fever
and
this
because
her
eyes
could
ever
picture
that
other
woman
quitting
him
at
daybreak
did
she
love
luc
then
and
had
she
only
become
conscious
of
it
on
the
day
when
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
win
his
love
that
indeed
was
the
disaster
to
learn
in
such
a
brutal
fashion
that
she
loved
and
that
another
already
possessed
the
heart
over
which
she
might
perchance
have
reigned
like
some
beloved
queen
all
the
rest
vanished
she
recalled
neither
how
her
love
had
sprung
up
nor
how
it
had
grown
nor
how
it
was
that
she
had
remained
ignorant
of
it
artless
still
in
her
thirtieth
year
happy
simply
in
the
enjoyment
of
affectionate
intimacy
untouched
till
now
by
passion
dart
her
tears
gushed
forth
at
last
and
she
sobbed
over
her
discovery
over
the
sudden
obstacle
which
had
risen
to
part
her
from
the
man
to
whom
unknowingly
she
had
given
both
heart
and
soul
and
now
naught
but
the
knowledge
of
her
love
existed
for
her
and
she
asked
herself
what
should
she
do
how
should
she
succeed
in
making
herself
loved
for
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
should
not
be
loved
in
return
since
she
herself
loved
and
would
never
cease
to
love
now
that
her
love
was
known
to
her
it
began
to
consume
her
heart
and
she
felt
that
she
would
no
longer
be
able
to
live
unless
it
were
shared
at
the
same
time
all
remained
confusion
within
her
she
struggled
amidst
vague
and
contradictory
thoughts
obscure
plans
like
a
woman
who
despite
her
years
has
remained
childish
and
suddenly
finds
herself
confronted
by
the
torturing
realities
of
life
long
must
she
have
remained
striving
to
annihilate
herself
with
her
face
close
pressed
to
her
pillow
the
sun
climbed
the
heavens
the
morning
sped
on
and
yet
in
her
increasing
distress
she
could
devise
no
practical
solution
for
the
problem
that
tortured
her
ever
and
ever
did
the
haunting
questions
come
back
how
would
she
manage
to
say
that
she
loved
and
how
would
she
manage
to
secure
love
in
return
all
at
once
however
she
bethought
herself
of
her
brother
it
was
in
him
that
she
must
confide
since
he
alone
really
knew
her
knew
that
her
heart
had
never
lied
he
was
a
man
he
would
surely
understand
her
and
he
would
teach
her
what
it
is
meet
for
one
to
do
when
a
craving
for
happiness
possesses
one
accordingly
without
reasoning
any
further
she
sprang
off
her
bed
and
went
downstairs
to
the
laboratory
like
a
child
who
has
at
last
discovered
a
solution
for
its
grief
that
morning
jordan
himself
had
experienced
a
disastrous
check
of
recent
months
he
had
believed
that
he
had
devised
a
safe
and
cheap
system
for
the
transport
of
electric
force
he
burnt
coal
beside
the
pit
it
came
from
and
he
carried
electricity
over
long
distances
without
the
slightest
loss
of
power
in
such
wise
as
to
lessen
cost
price
considerably
he
had
given
four
years
of
study
to
that
problem
amidst
all
the
recurring
ailments
to
which
his
puny
frame
was
subject
he
made
the
best
use
possible
of
his
weak
health
sleeping
a
great
deal
wrapped
round
with
rugs
and
then
methodically
employing
the
few
hours
which
he
was
able
to
wrest
from
his
unkind
mother
nature
for
fear
of
disturbing
his
studies
the
crisis
through
which
la
crÃªcherie
was
passing
had
been
hidden
from
him
he
thought
that
things
were
going
on
satisfactorily
at
the
works
and
besides
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
take
any
interest
in
such
matters
cloistered
as
he
was
in
his
laboratory
absorbed
in
his
work
apart
from
which
nothing
seemed
to
exist
in
the
whole
world
that
very
morning
at
an
early
hour
he
had
resumed
his
studies
feeling
his
mind
to
be
quite
clear
and
wishing
to
profit
by
it
in
order
to
make
a
last
experiment
and
that
experiment
had
absolutely
failed
he
found
himself
confronted
by
an
unforeseen
obstacle
some
error
in
his
calculations
some
detail
which
he
had
neglected
and
which
suddenly
became
important
and
indefinitely
postponing
the
solution
that
he
had
long
sought
with
respect
to
his
electrical
furnaces
it
was
the
downfall
of
his
hopes
so
much
hard
work
had
yielded
nothing
so
much
more
of
it
would
be
necessary
yet
he
remained
calm
and
had
just
wrapped
himself
in
his
rugs
again
and
ensconced
himself
in
the
in
which
he
spent
so
many
hours
when
his
sister
came
into
the
laboratory
she
looked
so
pale
so
greatly
distressed
that
he
immediately
felt
anxious
on
her
account
he
who
had
witnessed
the
failure
of
his
experiment
with
unruffled
brow
like
a
man
whom
nothing
can
discourage
is
the
matter
my
dear
he
asked
her
you
not
well
her
confession
in
no
wise
embarrassed
her
without
any
hesitation
like
a
poor
creature
whose
heart
opens
with
a
sob
she
said
matter
brother
dear
is
that
i
love
luc
and
that
he
does
not
love
me
ah
i
am
very
unhappy
then
simple
and
artless
she
told
her
brother
the
whole
story
how
she
had
seen
josine
leaving
the
pavilion
and
how
she
had
then
felt
such
a
that
she
had
come
in
search
of
consolation
and
cure
she
loved
luc
and
luc
did
not
love
her
jordan
listened
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
as
if
she
had
apprised
him
of
some
unexpected
extraordinary
cataclysm
love
luc
you
love
luc
he
repeated
why
love
the
thought
that
love
possessed
that
fondly
treasured
sister
whom
he
had
always
seen
beside
him
like
his
second
self
filled
him
with
amazement
he
had
never
thought
that
she
might
some
day
love
and
from
that
cause
become
unhappy
love
was
a
craving
of
which
he
himself
knew
nothing
a
sphere
into
which
he
had
never
entered
and
thus
artless
and
ignorant
as
he
himself
was
his
embarrassment
became
extreme
tell
me
brother
why
does
luc
love
that
josine
why
does
he
not
love
me
sÅurette
repeated
she
was
sobbing
now
she
had
wound
her
arms
around
her
brother
neck
resting
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
so
weighed
down
by
distress
that
he
was
utterly
distracted
and
yet
what
could
he
say
to
console
her
do
know
little
sister
i
do
know
he
answered
doubt
he
loves
her
because
it
is
his
nature
to
love
there
can
be
no
other
reason
he
would
love
you
if
he
had
loved
you
the
first
there
was
truth
in
this
luc
loved
josine
because
she
was
an
a
woman
of
charm
and
passion
whom
he
had
found
suffering
and
who
had
kindled
into
flame
all
the
love
of
his
heart
and
besides
beauty
was
hers
with
the
passion
which
peoples
the
world
brother
said
sÅurette
knew
me
before
he
knew
her
so
why
did
he
not
love
me
first
more
and
more
embarrassed
by
these
questions
jordan
anxiously
sought
for
delicate
and
kindly
words
he
answered
was
because
he
lived
here
like
a
friend
a
brother
he
has
become
a
brother
for
you
and
me
whilst
speaking
thus
jordan
looked
at
his
sister
and
this
time
he
did
not
tell
her
all
that
he
thought
he
observed
her
resemblance
to
himself
she
was
so
slender
so
frail
so
insignificant
she
did
not
represent
love
she
was
too
pale
and
puny
charming
no
doubt
very
gentle
and
very
kind
but
then
ever
clad
in
black
and
sad
as
are
all
the
silent
and
devoted
ones
for
luc
she
had
never
been
aught
but
an
intelligent
and
a
benevolent
creature
will
understand
little
sister
jordan
presently
resumed
if
he
has
become
as
it
were
your
brother
and
mine
he
can
not
love
you
in
the
same
way
as
he
loves
josine
such
a
thing
would
not
have
entered
his
mind
but
none
the
less
i
am
sure
that
he
loves
you
a
great
deal
he
loves
you
indeed
all
the
more
as
much
in
fact
as
i
myself
love
you
but
would
not
admit
it
her
whole
being
protested
dolorously
and
amidst
a
fresh
explosion
of
sobs
she
cried
her
distress
aloud
no
he
does
not
love
me
the
more
he
does
not
love
me
at
all
to
love
a
woman
as
a
brother
what
is
that
when
i
suffer
as
i
am
suffering
now
that
i
see
him
lost
to
me
if
i
knew
naught
of
all
those
things
a
little
while
ago
at
least
i
divine
them
now
and
i
feel
as
if
i
should
die
yes
die
like
herself
jordan
was
becoming
more
and
more
distressed
and
only
with
difficulty
was
he
able
to
restrain
his
tears
sister
little
sister
said
he
grieve
me
deeply
it
is
scarcely
reasonable
of
you
to
make
yourself
ill
like
this
i
no
longer
recognise
you
you
are
usually
so
calm
and
sensible
and
you
are
well
aware
what
firmness
of
spirit
one
ought
to
evince
in
order
to
resist
the
worries
of
life
then
he
wished
to
reason
with
her
he
said
have
no
reproach
to
address
to
luc
none
i
know
that
he
has
a
great
deal
of
affection
for
me
we
are
very
good
friends
she
answered
plaintively
you
must
not
complain
he
loves
you
as
he
is
able
to
love
and
you
do
wrong
in
getting
angry
with
him
i
am
not
angry
i
have
no
hate
for
anybody
i
only
suffer
again
did
her
sobs
burst
forth
again
did
distress
master
her
and
wring
from
her
lips
the
cry
does
he
not
love
me
why
does
he
not
love
me
he
does
not
love
you
as
you
desire
to
be
loved
little
sister
said
jordan
is
because
he
does
not
know
you
well
enough
no
he
does
not
know
you
as
i
do
he
does
not
know
that
you
are
the
best
the
gentlest
the
most
devoted
and
affectionate
of
women
you
would
have
been
a
fit
companion
and
helper
the
one
that
makes
pathway
softer
and
easier
but
the
other
came
with
her
beauty
and
that
assuredly
was
a
powerful
force
since
he
followed
her
without
perceiving
you
and
this
although
you
already
loved
him
come
my
dear
you
must
resign
yourself
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
he
kissed
her
hair
but
she
still
went
on
struggling
no
i
can
not
you
will
resign
yourself
you
are
too
good
too
intelligent
to
do
otherwise
some
day
you
will
forget
never
did
wrong
to
say
that
i
will
not
ask
you
to
forget
keep
the
memory
of
it
in
your
heart
but
i
do
ask
you
to
be
resigned
because
i
well
know
that
you
are
capable
of
resignation
even
to
the
point
of
sacrifice
think
of
all
the
disasters
which
would
follow
if
you
were
to
rebel
to
speak
out
our
life
would
be
broken
up
our
enterprises
shattered
and
you
would
suffer
a
thousand
times
more
than
you
do
now
she
interrupted
him
quivering
let
our
life
be
broken
up
let
our
enterprises
be
shattered
at
least
i
shall
have
satisfied
myself
it
is
cruel
of
you
brother
to
speak
to
me
like
that
you
are
an
egotist
egotist
replied
jordan
i
am
only
thinking
of
you
my
dear
little
sister
at
this
moment
grief
is
turning
your
wonted
kindliness
to
exasperation
but
how
bitter
would
be
your
remorse
if
i
were
to
allow
you
to
destroy
everything
you
would
no
longer
be
able
to
live
in
presence
of
the
ruins
that
you
would
have
piled
up
poor
dear
girl
you
will
resign
yourself
and
find
happiness
in
abnegation
and
pure
affection
tears
were
choking
him
and
their
sobs
mingled
that
battle
between
brother
and
sister
both
so
artless
and
so
loving
was
fraught
with
the
most
exquisite
fraternal
affection
in
a
tone
of
intense
compassion
blended
with
boundless
kindliness
jordan
repeated
will
resign
yourself
you
will
resign
yourself
she
still
protested
but
like
one
who
is
surrendering
her
moan
now
was
that
of
a
poor
stricken
creature
whose
hurt
one
strives
to
soothe
no
i
can
not
i
do
not
resign
myself
as
it
happened
luc
that
very
day
was
to
take
with
the
jordans
and
when
at
eleven
he
joined
the
brother
and
sister
in
the
laboratory
he
found
them
still
agitated
with
red
blurred
eyes
but
he
himself
was
so
distressed
so
downcast
that
he
noticed
nothing
josine
farewell
the
necessity
of
that
separation
filled
him
with
despair
the
severance
of
the
love
which
he
deemed
essential
for
his
mission
seemed
to
deprive
him
of
his
last
strength
if
he
did
not
save
josine
he
would
never
save
the
unhappy
multitude
to
whom
he
had
given
his
heart
and
that
day
from
the
moment
of
rising
all
the
obstacles
which
hindered
his
advance
had
risen
up
before
him
like
insurmountable
impediments
a
black
vision
of
la
crÃªcherie
had
appeared
to
him
la
crÃªcherie
on
the
path
to
ruin
wrecked
already
to
such
a
point
indeed
that
it
was
madness
to
hope
to
save
it
men
devoured
one
another
there
it
had
been
impossible
to
establish
brotherly
accord
between
them
every
human
fatality
weighed
upon
the
enterprise
and
thus
bowed
down
by
the
most
frightful
discouragement
he
had
ever
known
luc
lost
his
faith
the
heroism
within
him
wavered
he
was
almost
on
the
point
of
renouncing
his
task
fearing
as
he
did
that
defeat
was
near
at
hand
sÅurette
noticed
his
perturbation
directly
she
saw
him
and
with
divine
solicitude
she
expressed
her
anxiety
you
not
well
my
friend
she
asked
him
i
do
not
feel
well
he
answered
spent
an
awful
morning
i
have
heard
of
nothing
but
misfortunes
since
i
rose
she
did
not
insist
but
gazed
at
him
with
increasing
anxiety
wondering
what
his
sufferings
could
be
since
he
loved
and
was
loved
in
return
to
hide
in
some
slight
degree
her
own
intense
emotion
she
had
seated
herself
at
her
little
table
and
pretended
to
be
writing
out
some
notes
for
her
brother
whilst
the
latter
who
now
seemed
overwhelmed
again
lay
back
in
his
that
case
my
good
luc
said
he
of
us
is
any
better
off
than
the
others
for
if
i
felt
well
enough
when
i
got
up
this
morning
i
have
since
had
no
end
of
worry
for
a
moment
luc
walked
about
the
room
silent
with
a
frown
upon
his
face
he
came
and
went
pausing
at
times
before
one
of
the
large
windows
to
glance
over
la
crÃªcherie
the
budding
town
whose
roofs
spread
out
before
him
at
last
unable
to
restrain
his
despair
any
longer
he
exploded
must
speak
out
my
friend
i
owe
you
the
truth
we
did
not
wish
to
worry
you
in
the
midst
of
your
researches
and
we
have
hitherto
hidden
from
you
the
fact
that
things
are
going
on
very
badly
at
la
crÃªcherie
our
men
are
leaving
us
disunion
and
revolt
have
sprung
up
among
them
the
fruit
of
egotism
and
hatred
all
beauclair
is
rising
against
us
the
traders
and
even
the
workmen
themselves
whose
habits
we
interfere
with
and
thus
our
position
is
day
by
day
becoming
more
and
more
disquieting
i
do
know
if
i
see
things
in
too
gloomy
a
light
this
morning
but
they
appear
to
me
to
be
beyond
cure
everything
seems
to
be
lost
and
i
can
not
hide
from
you
any
longer
that
we
are
going
towards
a
catastrophe
jordan
listened
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
though
he
remained
very
calm
he
even
smiled
slightly
you
not
exaggerating
things
a
little
my
friend
said
he
that
i
am
exaggerating
suppose
that
ruin
will
not
actually
fall
on
us
none
the
less
i
should
be
acting
wrongly
if
i
failed
to
tell
you
that
i
fear
ruin
is
approaching
when
i
asked
you
for
your
land
and
your
money
to
undertake
that
work
of
social
salvation
which
i
dreamt
of
did
i
not
promise
you
not
only
the
accomplishment
of
something
great
and
beautiful
worthy
of
a
man
like
you
but
also
a
good
investment
and
now
it
appears
that
i
did
not
speak
the
truth
for
your
money
is
likely
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
disaster
is
it
not
natural
therefore
that
i
should
be
haunted
by
remorse
jordan
tried
to
interrupt
him
by
waving
his
hand
as
if
to
say
that
the
pecuniary
question
was
of
no
importance
but
luc
continued
is
not
merely
a
question
of
the
large
sums
which
have
already
been
swallowed
up
more
money
is
each
day
becoming
necessary
to
continue
the
struggle
and
i
no
longer
dare
to
ask
it
of
you
for
if
i
can
sacrifice
myself
entirely
i
have
no
right
to
pull
you
and
your
sister
down
with
me
he
sank
upon
a
chair
like
one
overcome
whilst
sÅurette
still
very
pale
and
seated
at
her
little
table
looked
both
at
him
and
at
her
brother
awaiting
developments
in
a
state
of
deep
emotion
really
so
things
are
so
very
bad
jordan
quietly
resumed
your
idea
was
a
very
good
one
you
ended
by
convincing
me
of
that
i
did
not
hide
from
you
that
i
took
no
personal
interest
in
such
political
and
social
enterprises
being
convinced
that
science
is
the
only
revolutionary
and
will
alone
bring
about
the
evolution
of
leading
man
towards
truth
and
justice
in
their
entirety
but
your
theory
of
solidarity
was
so
beautiful
sitting
at
this
window
after
my
day
work
i
often
looked
at
your
town
and
it
was
with
interest
that
i
saw
it
growing
it
amused
me
and
i
said
to
myself
that
i
was
working
for
it
since
electricity
would
one
day
prove
its
chief
helpmate
must
everything
be
abandoned
then
a
cry
of
supreme
renunciation
came
from
luc
energy
is
exhausted
he
exclaimed
have
no
courage
left
all
my
faith
has
departed
it
is
all
over
and
i
came
to
tell
you
that
i
am
prepared
to
abandon
everything
rather
than
impose
a
fresh
sacrifice
upon
you
how
could
you
give
me
the
money
which
we
should
need
how
could
i
even
have
audacity
enough
to
ask
you
for
it
never
had
man
raised
a
more
despairing
cry
this
was
the
evil
hour
the
black
hour
well
known
to
all
heroes
all
apostles
the
hour
when
grace
departs
when
the
mission
becomes
obscured
and
the
task
appears
impossible
forsooth
a
passing
defeat
a
momentary
spell
of
cowardice
accompanied
however
by
the
most
frightful
suffering
but
jordan
again
smiled
quietly
he
did
not
immediately
answer
the
remark
which
luc
with
a
shudder
had
addressed
to
him
respecting
the
large
amount
of
money
which
would
be
needed
if
the
work
were
to
be
carried
on
in
a
chilly
way
he
pulled
his
rugs
over
his
spare
limbs
then
gently
said
you
know
my
good
friend
i
not
very
well
pleased
either
yes
a
perfect
disaster
befell
me
this
morning
you
know
how
i
thought
that
i
had
planned
a
perfect
scheme
for
transmitting
electric
force
cheaply
and
without
any
loss
over
long
distances
well
i
was
mistaken
i
have
discovered
nothing
of
what
i
thought
i
had
an
experiment
which
i
made
this
morning
by
way
of
checking
everything
failed
completely
and
i
have
convinced
myself
that
it
is
necessary
to
begin
all
over
again
that
means
a
fresh
labour
of
years
and
you
will
understand
how
worrying
it
is
to
encounter
defeat
when
one
imagines
victory
to
be
certain
sÅurette
had
turned
towards
her
brother
quite
upset
at
hearing
of
that
defeat
of
which
she
had
hitherto
been
ignorant
in
like
manner
luc
prompted
to
compassion
by
his
own
despair
stretched
out
his
hand
in
order
to
grasp
his
friend
with
brotherly
sympathy
and
jordan
alone
remained
calm
apart
from
the
slight
feverish
tremulousness
which
always
came
over
him
when
he
had
exerted
himself
unduly
that
case
what
do
you
intend
to
do
luc
inquired
do
i
intend
to
do
my
good
friend
why
i
shall
set
to
work
again
i
shall
make
a
fresh
start
i
shall
begin
my
work
anew
from
the
very
beginning
there
is
evidently
nothing
else
to
be
done
it
is
simple
enough
you
hear
me
one
ought
never
to
throw
up
a
task
if
it
needs
twenty
years
thirty
years
a
whole
lifetime
one
still
ought
to
persevere
with
it
if
one
makes
a
mistake
one
must
retrace
one
steps
and
go
over
the
whole
ground
afresh
as
many
times
as
may
be
necessary
obstacles
and
hindrances
are
inevitable
on
the
road
and
must
be
anticipated
a
task
an
however
is
like
a
sacred
child
and
it
would
be
criminal
not
to
persevere
during
the
period
of
gestation
there
is
some
of
our
blood
in
it
we
have
no
right
to
refuse
to
perfect
it
we
owe
it
all
our
strength
soul
flesh
and
mind
even
as
a
mother
dies
at
times
through
the
dear
little
one
whom
she
hopes
to
bring
into
the
world
so
should
we
be
ready
to
die
if
our
task
exhaust
us
and
if
it
does
not
cost
us
life
we
have
but
one
thing
to
do
when
it
is
accomplished
and
that
is
to
begin
another
never
pausing
but
taking
up
one
task
after
another
as
long
as
we
are
erect
full
of
intelligence
and
virility
as
jordan
spoke
he
seemed
to
become
tall
and
strong
shielded
against
all
discouragement
by
his
belief
in
human
effort
convinced
of
conquering
provided
that
he
devoted
to
the
fight
the
last
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
and
to
luc
who
was
listening
it
seemed
as
if
a
gust
of
energy
came
to
him
from
that
weak
and
puny
being
work
continued
jordan
is
no
other
force
in
the
world
when
one
has
set
one
faith
in
work
one
is
invincible
why
should
we
doubt
of
since
it
is
we
ourselves
who
create
by
our
work
all
that
is
now
being
sown
by
our
work
will
prove
harvest
ah
holy
work
creative
work
thou
art
my
life
the
one
sole
reason
why
i
live
his
eyes
wandered
afar
as
communing
with
himself
he
repeated
those
last
words
that
hymn
to
work
which
ever
returned
to
his
lips
in
moments
of
great
emotion
and
once
again
he
related
how
work
had
ever
consoled
and
sustained
him
if
he
were
still
alive
it
was
because
he
had
taken
into
his
life
a
task
for
which
he
had
regulated
all
the
functions
of
his
being
he
was
convinced
that
he
would
not
die
so
long
as
his
work
should
remain
unfinished
bad
as
was
his
health
he
had
never
entered
his
laboratory
without
feeling
relief
how
many
times
had
he
not
sat
down
to
his
task
with
limbs
and
tearful
heart
yet
on
each
occasion
work
had
healed
him
his
uncertainties
his
infrequent
moments
of
discouragement
had
only
come
from
his
hours
of
idleness
all
at
once
he
turned
towards
luc
with
his
kindly
smile
and
said
by
way
of
conclusion
see
my
friend
if
you
let
la
crÃªcherie
die
you
yourself
will
die
of
it
that
task
is
your
very
life
and
you
must
live
it
to
the
end
luc
had
risen
upbuoyed
once
more
for
his
friend
faith
in
work
his
passionate
love
for
his
chosen
task
filled
him
again
with
a
spirit
of
heroism
and
restored
both
his
faith
and
his
strength
in
his
hours
of
lassitude
and
doubt
there
was
nothing
like
the
bath
of
energy
which
he
found
beside
jordan
that
weak
and
sickly
friend
of
his
from
whom
peace
and
certainty
seemed
to
radiate
you
are
right
he
cried
am
a
coward
i
feel
ashamed
that
i
despaired
human
happiness
only
exists
in
the
glorification
and
reorganisation
of
work
it
will
found
our
city
but
then
my
friend
that
money
all
that
money
which
must
again
be
risked
jordan
exhausted
by
his
own
passionate
outburst
was
now
drawing
his
rugs
more
closely
around
his
puny
shoulders
and
in
a
faint
voice
he
simply
said
will
give
you
the
money
we
will
economise
we
shall
always
be
able
to
get
on
here
we
need
very
little
you
know
milk
eggs
and
fruit
provided
that
i
am
still
able
to
pay
the
expenses
of
my
experiments
the
rest
will
be
all
right
luc
had
caught
hold
of
his
hands
and
was
pressing
them
with
deep
emotion
my
friend
my
friend
said
he
is
your
sister
are
we
to
ruin
her
also
replied
jordan
have
forgotten
sÅurette
they
turned
towards
her
she
was
silently
weeping
at
her
little
table
on
which
she
had
leant
her
elbows
whilst
her
chin
rested
between
her
hands
big
tears
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
her
poor
tortured
bleeding
heart
was
venting
all
its
woe
she
as
well
as
luc
had
been
stirred
to
the
depths
of
her
being
by
all
that
she
had
heard
everything
which
her
brother
had
said
to
his
friend
had
resounded
with
equal
energy
within
her
own
heart
the
necessity
of
work
of
abnegation
in
the
presence
of
one
task
did
that
not
also
mean
acceptance
of
life
whatever
it
might
be
and
resolution
to
live
it
loyally
in
order
that
all
possible
harmony
might
accrue
therefrom
like
luc
she
now
would
have
thought
herself
and
cowardly
had
she
sought
to
hinder
the
great
work
had
she
not
devoted
herself
to
it
even
to
renunciation
of
all
else
besides
the
great
courage
of
her
simple
kindly
sublime
nature
had
returned
to
her
once
more
she
rose
and
pressed
a
long
kiss
upon
her
brother
brow
and
whilst
she
remained
beside
him
with
her
head
resting
on
his
shoulder
she
whispered
to
him
gently
you
brother
you
have
healed
me
i
will
sacrifice
myself
luc
however
once
again
eager
for
action
was
now
bestirring
himself
he
had
gone
back
towards
the
window
and
was
gazing
at
the
glow
which
fell
upon
the
roofs
of
la
crÃªcherie
from
the
broad
blue
heavens
and
as
he
came
back
towards
the
others
he
once
more
repeated
his
favourite
cry
they
do
not
love
on
the
day
they
love
all
will
prove
fruitful
all
will
spread
and
grow
and
triumph
in
the
sunlight
then
with
a
last
quiver
of
her
subjugated
flesh
sÅurette
who
had
affectionately
drawn
near
to
him
replied
one
must
love
even
without
wishing
to
be
loved
in
return
for
it
is
only
by
loving
others
that
the
great
work
can
ever
be
those
words
from
one
who
gave
herself
unreservedly
for
the
sole
joy
of
doing
so
and
without
hope
of
reward
were
followed
by
a
deep
quivering
silence
they
no
longer
spoke
but
all
three
united
by
close
brotherliness
gazed
towards
the
greenery
amidst
which
the
rising
city
of
justice
and
happiness
would
gradually
but
ever
spread
its
roofs
now
that
so
much
love
was
sown
iv
from
that
time
forward
luc
the
builder
the
founder
of
cities
recovered
his
spoke
his
will
and
acted
and
men
and
stones
arose
at
his
bidding
he
became
very
gay
and
carried
on
the
struggle
of
la
crÃªcherie
against
the
abyss
with
triumphant
joyousness
little
by
little
winning
over
both
folk
and
things
thanks
to
the
craving
for
love
and
happiness
which
he
inspired
all
around
him
he
himself
felt
that
the
secure
establishment
of
his
city
would
bring
him
back
josine
with
her
all
the
woeful
ones
of
the
whole
world
would
be
saved
in
this
he
set
his
faith
and
he
worked
by
and
for
love
in
the
conviction
that
he
would
ultimately
conquer
one
bright
day
when
the
sky
was
radiantly
blue
he
came
upon
a
scene
which
again
heightened
his
spirits
and
filled
his
heart
with
tenderness
and
hope
as
he
was
going
round
the
dependencies
of
the
works
desirous
of
giving
an
eye
to
everything
he
was
surprised
to
hear
some
light
fresh
voices
and
bursts
of
laughter
rising
from
a
corner
of
the
property
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
ridge
a
spot
where
a
wall
separated
the
land
of
la
crÃªcherie
from
that
of
the
abyss
approaching
prudently
for
he
wished
to
see
without
being
seen
himself
luc
perceived
to
his
delight
a
party
of
children
playing
freely
in
the
sunshine
restored
to
all
the
fraternal
innocence
of
nature
on
luc
side
of
the
wall
nanet
who
daily
returned
to
la
crÃªcherie
in
search
of
playmates
stood
beside
lucien
and
antoinette
bonnaire
whom
he
had
doubtless
persuaded
to
accompany
him
on
some
terrible
lizard
hunt
all
three
of
them
stood
there
with
upturned
faces
laughing
and
calling
whilst
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
other
children
who
could
not
be
seen
were
laughing
and
calling
also
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
nise
delaveau
had
had
some
young
friends
to
lunch
and
that
the
party
on
being
dismissed
to
the
garden
had
heard
the
calls
of
those
outside
it
one
and
all
becoming
eager
to
see
each
other
join
hands
and
amuse
themselves
together
unfortunately
the
former
doorway
had
been
walled
up
for
their
elders
had
grown
tired
of
scolding
them
at
delaveau
the
children
were
even
forbidden
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
were
punished
if
they
were
found
doing
so
whilst
at
la
crÃªcherie
there
were
many
efforts
to
make
them
understand
that
their
disobedience
might
bring
about
some
unpleasant
affair
complaints
and
even
a
lawsuit
but
like
artless
young
creatures
yielding
to
the
unknown
forces
of
the
future
they
continued
meeting
and
mingling
fraternising
together
in
total
forgetfulness
of
all
class
rancour
and
hostility
shrill
pure
and
crystalline
voices
continued
rising
almost
suggesting
the
notes
of
skylarks
that
you
nise
good
day
nise
day
nanet
are
you
by
yourself
nanet
no
i
with
lucien
and
antoinette
and
you
nise
are
you
alone
no
no
i
with
louise
and
paul
good
day
good
day
nanet
day
good
day
nise
at
each
day
again
and
again
repeated
came
peals
of
laughter
so
amused
did
they
feel
at
talking
together
without
seeing
one
another
say
nise
are
you
still
there
yes
nanet
i
still
here
nise
listen
are
you
coming
nanet
how
can
i
since
the
door
walled
up
jump
nise
jump
my
little
nise
my
little
nanet
jump
jump
then
came
perfect
delirium
all
six
of
them
repeated
jump
whilst
dancing
before
the
wall
as
if
indeed
they
imagined
that
by
bounding
higher
and
higher
they
would
at
last
find
themselves
together
they
turned
and
waltzed
and
bowed
to
the
pitiless
wall
and
with
that
childish
power
of
imagination
which
suppresses
all
obstacles
played
as
if
they
could
really
see
one
another
at
last
a
voice
again
arose
nise
do
you
know
what
nanet
i
do
know
i
going
to
get
on
the
wall
and
i
pull
you
up
by
the
shoulders
and
get
you
over
here
that
it
nanet
that
it
climb
up
in
a
trice
nanet
clinging
to
the
stone
wall
with
hands
and
feet
as
agile
as
a
cat
found
himself
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
as
he
sat
there
bestriding
it
he
looked
quite
comical
with
his
big
round
head
his
large
blue
eyes
and
his
tumbled
fair
hair
he
was
already
fourteen
but
he
remained
little
though
very
strong
and
resolute
antoinette
he
cried
you
keep
watch
then
bending
over
delaveau
garden
quite
proud
of
overlooking
everything
on
both
sides
of
the
wall
he
added
on
nise
let
me
catch
hold
of
you
no
not
me
first
nanet
i
keep
watch
over
here
who
coming
nise
a
minute
nanet
be
careful
paul
climbing
up
there
a
trellis
he
try
it
to
see
if
it
breaks
silence
followed
one
only
heard
the
cracking
of
some
old
woodwork
mingled
with
stifled
laughter
and
luc
began
to
ask
himself
if
he
ought
not
to
restore
order
by
scattering
both
bands
of
urchins
even
as
one
scatters
sparrows
on
surprising
them
in
a
barn
how
many
times
already
had
not
he
himself
scolded
those
children
from
fear
lest
their
playfulness
should
prove
the
cause
of
some
annoying
trouble
yet
there
was
something
very
charming
about
the
bravery
and
joyousness
which
they
displayed
in
seeking
to
join
one
another
in
spite
of
every
prohibition
and
every
obstacle
at
last
a
cry
of
triumph
arose
paul
head
appeared
just
above
the
wall
and
nanet
was
seen
hoisting
him
up
and
then
passing
him
over
in
order
that
he
might
fall
into
the
arms
of
lucien
and
antoinette
although
paul
himself
was
more
than
fourteen
he
was
not
a
heavy
weight
he
had
remained
slim
and
delicate
a
handsome
lad
very
and
gentle
with
quick
and
intelligent
eyes
directly
he
had
fallen
into
antoinette
embrace
he
kissed
her
for
he
knew
her
well
and
was
fond
of
being
near
her
for
she
was
tall
and
pretty
and
very
graceful
although
but
twelve
years
old
done
nise
cried
nanet
passed
one
over
whose
turn
next
but
nise
was
heard
replying
in
a
loud
anxious
whisper
hush
nanet
there
something
moving
near
the
fowls
run
lie
down
on
the
wall
quick
quick
then
the
danger
being
past
she
added
out
nanet
it
louise
turn
now
i
push
her
up
this
time
indeed
it
was
louise
head
which
appeared
above
the
wall
a
comical
goatish
head
with
black
and
somewhat
eyes
a
slender
nose
and
pointed
chin
with
her
vivacity
and
gaiety
she
was
very
amusing
at
eleven
years
of
age
she
had
already
become
a
little
woman
quite
upsetting
her
parents
the
worthy
mazelles
who
were
stupefied
to
find
that
such
a
riotous
enthusiastic
wilding
had
sprung
from
their
placid
egotism
she
did
not
even
wait
for
nanet
to
pass
her
over
but
jumped
of
her
own
accord
into
the
arms
of
lucien
her
favourite
playmate
who
was
the
oldest
of
all
of
them
a
tall
sturdy
lad
of
fifteen
endowed
with
great
ingenuity
and
inventive
talent
he
made
her
some
extraordinary
playthings
but
nanet
was
again
calling
makes
two
nise
said
he
only
you
now
come
up
quick
there
something
moving
again
over
yonder
near
the
well
a
sound
of
cracking
wood
was
once
more
heard
a
large
piece
of
the
must
have
fallen
to
the
ground
for
nise
burst
out
dear
me
dear
me
nanet
i
ca
louise
broke
it
with
her
feet
and
now
it
all
down
mind
it
does
matter

me
your
hands
nise
and
i
pull
you
up
no

too
little
ca

and
you
must
stand
on
there
we
are
you
see
very
well
that
i
can
pull
you
up
evincing
great
dexterity
he
had
raised
nise
with
his
strong
young
arms
and
seated
her
on
the
wall
in
front
of
him
she
looked
even
more
tumbled
than
usual
with
her
fair
curly
pate
her
pink
and
mouth
and
her
pretty
blue
eyes
she
and
her
friend
nanet
formed
a
pair
both
of
them
with
locks
of
the
same
soft
golden
hue
curling
and
waving
hither
and
thither
for
a
moment
they
remained
astride
the
wall
face
to
face
and
delighted
at
finding
themselves
so
high
up
all
the
same
you
strong
nanet
to
have
pulled
me
up
as
you
did
said
the
girl
then
you
grown
quite
tall
nise
i
fourteen
now
how
old
are
you
eleven
nanet
but
i
say
is

on
a
horse
a
very
tall
horse
made
of
stone
but
i
say
nise
shall
i
stand
upright
upright
nanet
i
do
the
same
but
again
a
stir
was
heard
down
the
garden
this
time
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
and
the
two
children
full
of
anxiety
caught
hold
of
each
other
and
fell
to
the
ground
together
locked
in
a
close
embrace
they
might
have
killed
themselves
but
they
laughed
gaily
unhurt
and
delighted
with
their
tumble
paul
and
antoinette
lucien
and
louise
on
their
side
were
already
running
wildly
among
the
bushes
and
fallen
rocks
which
helped
to
form
many
a
delightful
nook
at
the
feet
of
the
bleuse
mountains
thinking
it
too
late
to
intervene
luc
went
off
very
softly
as
the
children
had
not
seen
him
they
would
not
know
that
he
had
closed
his
eyes
to
their
escapade
after
all
was
it
not
best
that
they
should
yield
to
the
glow
of
youth
within
them
and
meet
and
play
in
spite
of
all
the
prohibitions
they
were
like
the
very
florescence
of
life
which
well
knew
for
what
future
harvests
it
thus
flowered
in
them
and
they
brought
with
them
perchance
the
reconciliation
of
classes
the
morrow
full
of
justice
and
peace
which
was
awaited
that
which
their
fathers
could
not
accomplish
would
be
accomplished
by
them
and
yet
more
completely
by
their
children
thanks
to
the
evolution
which
was
ever
spreading
and
thus
luc
as
he
quietly
walked
away
refraining
from
alarming
them
laughed
to
himself
as
he
heard
them
laughing
heedless
of
the
difficulties
that
they
would
encounter
when
they
might
wish
to
climb
over
the
wall
again
that
glimpse
of
the
kindly
future
had
inspired
the
young
man
with
a
hope
a
courage
to
continue
fighting
and
a
determination
to
achieve
victory
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
for
long
months
the
desperate
pitiless
struggle
went
on
between
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
abyss
luc
who
had
momentarily
thought
his
enterprise
in
jeopardy
toppling
towards
ruin
exerted
every
effort
to
keep
it
on
its
legs
he
did
not
expect
to
gain
any
more
ground
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
he
wished
to
lose
none
and
it
was
already
an
achievement
to
remain
stationary
to
continue
living
amidst
the
blows
which
were
aimed
at
la
crÃªcherie
from
all
sides
and
how
mighty
was
the
toil
and
with
what
joyous
bravery
was
it
accomplished
luc
was
always
here
there
and
everywhere
encouraging
the
men
in
the
workshops
promoting
brotherliness
between
one
and
all
at
the
and
watching
over
the
management
of
the
stores
he
was
constantly
seen
too
in
the
sunlit
avenues
of
the
little
town
amidst
the
women
and
the
children
with
whom
he
liked
to
laugh
and
play
as
if
he
were
the
father
of
the
young
nation
now
springing
up
around
him
thanks
to
his
genius
and
creative
fruitfulness
things
arose
and
grew
methodically
as
if
in
obedience
to
a
wave
of
his
hand
but
his
greatest
achievement
was
the
conquest
of
his
workmen
amidst
whom
discord
and
rebellion
had
for
a
moment
swept
although
his
views
were
not
always
shared
by
bonnaire
he
had
won
that
brave
and
kindly
man
affection
in
such
wise
as
to
secure
in
him
the
most
faithful
the
most
devoted
of
lieutenants
one
without
whose
help
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
carry
on
the
enterprise
and
indeed
the
affection
which
radiated
from
luc
had
influenced
all
the
workers
of
la
crÃªcherie
who
finding
him
so
loving
and
brotherly
intent
on
securing
happiness
for
others
in
the
conviction
that
he
would
therein
find
happiness
himself
had
gradually
grouped
themselves
around
him
thus
the
staff
was
becoming
a
large
family
linked
more
and
more
closely
together
each
ending
by
understanding
that
he
worked
for
his
own
delight
when
he
worked
for
that
of
all
over
a
period
of
six
months
not
a
single
hand
quitted
the
works
and
if
those
who
had
previously
left
did
not
as
yet
return
the
others
who
remained
devoted
themselves
entirely
to
the
enterprise
even
leaving
a
part
of
their
profits
untouched
in
order
that
a
substantial
reserve
fund
might
be
formed
at
that
critical
period
it
was
assuredly
the
solidarity
evinced
by
all
the
associated
workers
that
saved
la
crÃªcherie
from
falling
beneath
the
blows
with
which
egotistical
and
jealous
hatred
inspired
beauclair
the
reserve
fund
prudently
increased
and
managed
proved
a
decisive
help
it
enabled
the
folk
of
la
crÃªcherie
to
face
difficult
moments
and
to
avoid
borrowing
at
heavy
interest
thanks
to
this
fund
moreover
they
were
twice
able
to
purchase
new
machinery
which
had
been
rendered
requisite
by
changes
in
various
processes
and
which
largely
diminished
the
cost
of
manufacture
then
too
there
came
a
few
strokes
of
luck
about
that
time
there
were
some
important
enterprises
the
laying
down
of
railways
the
building
of
bridges
and
other
things
in
which
metal
work
was
largely
used
and
thus
considerable
quantities
of
rails
girders
and
structural
material
were
required
the
long
peace
in
which
europe
lived
vastly
developed
metallurgical
industry
in
its
pacific
and
civilising
branches
never
before
had
iron
entered
so
largely
into
the
dwellings
of
men
thus
the
output
of
la
crÃªcherie
increased
though
the
profits
did
not
become
very
large
for
luc
particularly
wished
to
sell
cheaply
in
the
belief
that
cheapness
would
control
the
future
at
the
same
time
he
strengthened
the
works
by
wise
management
and
constant
economy
and
by
gathering
together
that
reserve
fund
of
ready
money
in
order
that
it
might
be
brought
into
use
at
the
first
sign
of
danger
whilst
the
workers
devotion
to
the
common
cause
their
abnegation
in
foregoing
a
portion
of
their
due
did
the
rest
enabling
one
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
triumph
without
excessive
hardship
the
abyss
meantime
apparently
remained
in
a
flourishing
situation
there
had
been
no
in
its
turnover
and
great
success
seemed
to
attend
its
costly
output
of
guns
and
projectiles
still
this
prosperity
was
only
on
the
surface
and
delaveau
though
he
did
not
confess
it
experienced
at
times
serious
anxiety
he
certainly
had
on
his
side
the
whole
of
beauclair
the
whole
of
that
capitalist
society
whose
existence
was
threatened
and
he
remained
convinced
that
he
represented
truth
authority
and
power
and
that
ultimate
victory
was
certain
nevertheless
after
a
time
secret
doubts
began
to
assail
him
he
was
disturbed
at
finding
so
much
vitality
in
la
crÃªcherie
whose
prompt
collapse
he
prophesied
every
three
months
or
so
he
could
no
longer
contend
against
the
neighbouring
works
with
respect
to
commercial
iron
and
steel
those
rails
girders
and
structural
materials
which
la
crÃªcherie
turned
out
so
well
and
so
cheaply
there
only
remained
to
him
the
manufacture
of
superfine
steel
of
carefully
made
articles
valued
at
three
and
four
francs
per
kilogramme
and
as
it
happened
these
were
also
made
at
two
very
important
establishments
in
a
neighbouring
department
the
competition
of
those
establishments
was
terrible
and
delaveau
felt
that
of
the
three
the
abyss
and
the
two
others
there
was
one
too
many
the
question
was
which
two
of
them
would
devour
the
third
weakened
as
it
was
by
the
rivalry
of
la
crÃªcherie
would
not
the
abyss
prove
to
be
the
establishment
fated
to
disappear
this
question
preyed
upon
the
manager
although
he
showed
more
activity
than
ever
and
professed
serene
confidence
in
the
good
cause
that
religion
of
the
wage
system
of
which
he
had
constituted
himself
the
defender
but
another
matter
worried
him
even
more
than
the
competition
of
rivals
and
the
chances
of
industrial
warfare
this
was
the
absence
of
any
reserve
fund
such
as
might
enable
him
to
face
some
emergency
some
unforeseen
catastrophe
if
a
crisis
were
to
arise
some
strike
or
simply
some
in
trade
the
result
would
be
disastrous
for
the
works
would
not
possess
the
wherewithal
to
await
a
revival
of
business
the
necessity
of
purchasing
some
new
plant
had
already
compelled
him
to
borrow
three
hundred
thousand
francs
and
the
heavy
interest
on
the
loan
now
weighed
upon
his
annual
budget
but
what
if
he
were
compelled
to
borrow
again
and
again
until
at
last
he
should
find
himself
swallowed
up
by
an
abyss
of
indebtedness
about
this
time
delaveau
tried
to
make
boisgelin
listen
to
reason
when
he
had
induced
the
latter
to
confide
to
him
the
remnants
of
his
fortune
he
had
certainly
promised
that
if
the
abyss
were
purchased
he
would
hand
him
heavy
interest
on
his
capital
and
enable
him
to
continue
leading
a
luxurious
life
now
however
that
difficulties
were
likely
to
arise
he
wished
boisgelin
to
be
reasonable
enough
to
cut
down
his
style
of
living
for
a
time
he
assured
him
that
fortune
would
soon
smile
once
more
and
that
he
would
then
be
able
to
live
again
on
his
former
footing
and
indeed
in
finer
style
than
ever
desire
was
to
induce
boisgelin
to
content
himself
for
a
while
with
one
half
of
the
profits
the
other
half
being
employed
to
constitute
a
reserve
fund
which
would
enable
the
abyss
to
emerge
victoriously
from
such
bad
times
as
might
present
themselves
but
boisgelin
would
not
listen
he
demanded
every
penny
refusing
to
forego
any
one
of
the
pleasures
of
the
costly
life
which
he
was
leading
quarrels
even
broke
out
between
the
two
cousins
now
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
invested
capital
might
no
longer
yield
the
expected
interest
that
the
toil
of
more
than
a
thousand
human
beings
might
no
longer
suffice
to
keep
an
idler
in
luxury
the
capitalist
accused
his
manager
of
failing
to
keep
his
promises
delaveau
though
irritated
by
the
other
idiotic
thirst
for
perpetual
enjoyment
still
entertained
no
suspicion
that
behind
that
coxcomb
his
cousin
there
stood
his
own
wife
fernande
the
devouring
creature
for
whom
all
the
money
was
squandered
in
caprices
and
folly
life
at
la
guerdache
was
nought
but
a
round
of
festivities
amidst
which
fernande
enjoyed
such
pleasing
triumphs
that
any
pause
in
her
delights
would
have
seemed
to
her
to
be
absolute
downfall
she
egged
on
boisgelin
she
told
him
that
her
husband
powers
were
declining
that
he
did
not
extract
from
the
works
nearly
so
large
a
revenue
as
he
might
have
done
and
according
to
her
the
only
way
to
spur
him
on
was
to
overwhelm
him
with
demands
for
money
the
demeanour
preserved
by
delaveau
who
was
one
of
those
authoritative
men
who
never
take
women
into
their
confidence
making
no
exception
even
of
his
wife
although
he
was
passionately
attached
to
her
had
ended
by
convincing
fernande
that
her
view
was
the
right
one
and
that
if
she
wished
to
realise
her
dream
of
returning
to
paris
with
millions
of
francs
to
squander
she
must
harass
him
without
cessation
one
night
however
delaveau
forgot
himself
in
fernande
presence
a
hunt
had
taken
place
at
la
guerdache
that
day
and
in
the
course
of
it
fernande
whose
delight
it
was
to
gallop
about
on
horseback
had
for
a
time
disappeared
in
the
company
of
boisgelin
a
great
dinner
had
followed
in
the
evening
and
it
was
past
midnight
when
a
carriage
brought
the
delaveaus
back
to
the
abyss
the
young
woman
who
seemed
overcome
with
fatigue
satiated
as
it
were
with
the
consuming
enjoyment
of
which
her
life
was
compounded
hastened
to
get
to
bed
whilst
her
husband
after
taking
off
his
coat
went
hither
and
thither
about
the
room
looking
both
angry
and
worried
say
he
ended
by
inquiring
not
boisgelin
tell
you
anything
when
you
went
off
with
him
at
this
fernande
who
was
closing
her
eyes
opened
them
again
in
surprise
she
answered
interesting
at
all
events
what
would
you
have
him
tell
me
the
fact
is
that
we
had
previously
had
a
discussion
together
delaveau
resumed
asked
me
to
let
him
have
another
ten
thousand
francs
for
the
end
of
the
month
but
this
time
i
positively
refused
it
impossible
it
madness
fernande
raised
her
head
and
her
eyes
glittered
that
said
she
do
you
give
him
those
ten
thousand
francs
as
it
happened
it
was
she
herself
who
had
suggested
the
application
for
this
money
in
order
that
boisgelin
might
purchase
an
electrical
motor
car
in
which
she
ardently
desired
to
travel
about
the
country
at
express
speed
cried
delaveau
forgetting
himself
that
idiot
with
his
extravagance
will
end
by
ruining
the
works
we
shall
have
a
smash
up
if
he
does
cut
down
his
style
of
living
there
can
be
nothing
more
idiotic
than
that
life
of
festivity
which
he
leads
that
stupid
vanity
of
his
which
prompts
him
to
let
everybody
despoil
him
startled
by
these
words
fernande
sat
up
in
bed
looking
rather
pale
whilst
delaveau
with
the
of
a
husband
blind
to
his
misconduct
went
on
only
one
sensible
person
left
at
la
guerdache
the
only
one
too
who
enjoys
nothing
there
i
mean
poor
suzanne
it
grieves
me
to
see
her
always
looking
so
sad
however
when
i
begged
her
to
intervene
with
her
husband
she
answered
forcing
back
her
tears
that
she
was
resolved
to
meddle
in
nothing
the
idea
that
her
husband
had
appealed
to
her
lover
wife
the
poor
sacrificed
creature
who
showed
such
lofty
dignity
in
her
life
of
renunciation
brought
fernande
exasperation
to
a
climax
but
she
was
still
more
moved
by
the
thought
that
the
works
the
very
source
of
her
enjoyment
might
be
in
peril
shall
have
a
smash
up
why
do
you
say
that
she
asked
thought
that
the
business
was
going
on
very
well
she
put
this
question
in
so
anxious
a
tone
that
delaveau
fearing
that
if
she
knew
everything
she
might
amplify
the
fears
which
he
strove
to
hide
from
himself
became
distrustful
and
forced
back
the
truth
which
anger
well
nigh
wrung
from
him
business
is
going
on
all
right
no
doubt
said
he
it
would
go
on
a
great
deal
better
if
boisgelin
did
not
perpetually
empty
the
safe
in
order
to
continue
leading
an
idiotic
life
the
man
a
fool
i
tell
you
he
has
only
the
poor
paltry
brain
of
a
coxcomb
reassured
by
this
reply
fernande
stretched
herself
out
in
bed
once
more
her
husband
was
simply
an
individual
with
a
gross
mind
a
miser
whose
desire
was
to
part
as
little
as
possible
with
the
large
sums
which
were
received
at
the
works
as
for
his
denunciation
of
boisgelin
this
was
an
indirect
attack
upon
herself
dear
said
she
by
way
of
conclusion
people
are
not
made
to
brutify
themselves
with
work
from
morning
till
night
and
those
who
have
money
do
right
to
enjoy
themselves
and
taste
the
pleasures
of
a
higher
life
delaveau
was
about
to
reply
violently
but
by
an
effort
he
managed
to
calm
himself
why
should
he
try
to
convert
his
wife
to
his
views
he
treated
her
as
a
spoilt
child
and
let
her
act
as
she
listed
never
complaining
of
any
lapses
on
her
part
such
as
he
condemned
when
others
were
in
question
he
did
not
even
notice
the
folly
of
her
life
for
she
was
his
own
folly
the
prized
jewel
which
he
had
longed
to
grasp
with
his
big
hands
she
remained
through
all
the
object
of
his
admiration
and
adoration
the
idol
for
whom
one
sets
aside
both
dignity
and
reason
and
whom
it
is
impossible
to
suspect
a
little
later
when
delaveau
in
his
turn
had
got
into
bed
his
anxiety
with
respect
to
the
position
of
the
works
came
back
to
him
his
wife
lay
fast
asleep
beside
him
but
he
himself
was
unable
to
close
his
eyes
and
amidst
his
painful
insomnia
the
difficulties
by
which
he
was
menaced
seemed
to
become
greater
never
yet
indeed
had
he
surveyed
the
future
with
so
much
insight
and
seen
it
under
darker
colours
he
became
fully
conscious
that
the
cause
of
the
impending
ruin
was
that
mad
craving
for
enjoyment
that
sickly
impatience
which
boisgelin
displayed
to
spend
his
money
the
moment
it
was
earned
there
was
an
abyss
somewhere
into
which
all
that
money
sank
some
abominable
sore
also
by
which
exuded
all
the
strength
and
gain
which
work
should
have
brought
with
it
accustomed
as
he
was
to
be
very
frank
with
himself
delaveau
passed
his
life
in
review
and
could
find
nothing
to
reproach
himself
with
he
rose
early
and
was
the
last
to
leave
the
workshops
at
night
remaining
on
the
watch
throughout
the
day
directing
the
labour
of
his
large
staff
as
he
might
have
directed
the
movements
of
a
regiment
he
incessantly
brought
all
his
remarkable
faculties
into
play
showing
a
great
deal
of
rectitude
amidst
his
roughness
together
with
rare
powers
of
logic
and
method
and
the
loyalty
of
a
fighter
who
has
vowed
to
conquer
and
is
determined
to
do
so
or
to
perish
thus
he
suffered
frightfully
at
feeling
that
in
spite
of
all
his
heroism
he
was
gliding
to
disaster
through
the
collapse
of
everything
that
he
set
on
foot
a
kind
of
daily
destruction
which
came
he
knew
not
whence
and
which
his
energy
was
powerless
to
stay
what
he
called
imbecile
life
that
gluttonous
craving
for
pleasure
was
doubtless
the
evil
that
preyed
upon
the
works
but
who
then
was
it
that
made
the
wretched
man
so
stupid
whence
came
that
insanity
of
his
which
he
delaveau
could
not
understand
sensible
and
sober
worker
that
he
was
himself
hating
idleness
and
excessive
enjoyment
since
he
knew
that
they
destroyed
all
creative
health
and
still
he
had
no
suspicion
that
the
demolisher
of
fortune
the
poisoner
of
his
mind
was
his
own
fernande
she
who
now
lay
beside
him
looking
so
charming
in
her
slumber
whilst
he
amidst
the
black
smoke
of
the
abyss
and
the
burning
glow
of
its
furnaces
exhausted
himself
in
efforts
to
wring
money
from
the
toil
of
workmen
she
on
her
side
strolled
in
gay
apparel
under
the
shady
foliage
of
la
guerdache
flung
money
to
the
four
winds
of
fancy
and
with
her
white
teeth
crunched
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
which
more
than
a
thousand
coined
for
her
amidst
the
resounding
thuds
of
the
great
hammers
that
night
too
whilst
her
husband
with
his
eyes
wide
open
in
the
darkness
remained
tortured
by
the
thought
of
future
payments
wondering
by
what
fresh
efforts
he
might
make
the
works
produce
the
amounts
promised
to
one
and
another
she
lying
by
his
side
slept
off
her
intoxication
of
the
day
so
weary
with
enjoyment
that
only
the
faintest
breath
came
from
her
glutted
breast
at
last
delaveau
himself
ended
by
falling
asleep
and
dreamt
that
some
weird
perverse
diabolical
powers
were
at
work
beneath
the
abyss
eating
away
the
soil
in
such
wise
that
the
whole
establishment
would
suddenly
be
engulfed
on
some
fulgural
tempestuous
night
during
the
days
which
followed
fernande
recalled
the
fears
which
her
husband
had
expressed
to
her
that
evening
whilst
making
every
allowance
for
what
she
regarded
as
his
passion
for
heaping
up
money
and
his
hatred
of
the
pleasures
of
luxury
she
could
not
help
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
a
possibility
of
ruin
boisgelin
ruined
indeed
in
such
a
case
what
would
become
of
her
that
ruin
would
not
simply
mean
an
end
to
the
delightful
life
which
she
had
always
desired
as
compensation
for
the
wretched
poverty
of
her
earlier
years
but
it
would
imply
their
return
to
paris
like
vanquished
beings
with
a
flat
of
a
thousand
francs
annual
rental
in
the
depths
of
some
suburban
district
and
some
petty
employment
for
delaveau
in
which
he
would
vegetate
whilst
she
herself
would
relapse
into
all
the
loathsome
coarseness
of
a
home
of
penurious
toil
no
no
she
would
not
consent
to
that
she
would
not
allow
her
golden
prey
to
escape
her
every
muscle
of
her
covetous
being
hungered
for
triumph
within
her
slender
form
instinct
with
such
delicate
charm
such
light
gracefulness
there
was
the
keen
appetite
of
a
the
most
furious
predatory
instincts
she
was
resolved
that
she
would
in
no
wise
check
that
appetite
that
she
would
take
her
pleasure
to
the
very
end
allowing
none
to
rob
her
of
it
no
doubt
she
was
full
of
contempt
for
those
grimy
muddy
works
where
day
and
night
she
heard
the
hammers
forging
pleasure
for
her
and
as
for
the
men
those
toilers
who
roasted
amidst
hellish
flames
in
order
that
she
might
lead
a
life
of
happy
idleness
she
regarded
them
as
domestic
animals
that
gave
her
food
and
spared
her
all
fatigue
she
never
risked
her
little
feet
on
the
uneven
soil
of
the
workshops
she
never
evinced
the
faintest
interest
in
the
human
flock
which
passed
to
and
fro
before
her
door
bowed
down
by
accursed
labour
nevertheless
those
works
and
that
flock
were
hers
and
the
idea
that
fortune
might
be
wrested
from
her
by
the
ruin
of
the
business
roused
her
to
revolt
prompted
her
to
defend
herself
as
energetically
as
if
her
life
itself
were
threatened
whosoever
harmed
the
works
became
her
personal
enemy
a
dangerous
of
whom
she
was
resolved
to
rid
herself
by
all
imaginable
means
thus
her
hatred
of
luc
had
gone
on
increasing
ever
since
the
sunday
when
they
had
first
met
at
lunch
at
la
guerdache
where
with
a
woman
keen
acumen
she
had
guessed
that
he
was
the
man
who
would
strive
to
bar
her
path
since
that
time
moreover
she
had
frequently
come
into
collision
with
him
and
now
it
was
he
who
threatened
to
destroy
the
abyss
and
to
cast
her
back
into
all
the
loathsomeness
of
mediocrity
if
she
should
allow
him
a
free
hand
her
happiness
would
be
over
he
would
rob
her
of
everything
that
she
cared
for
in
life
and
thus
beneath
her
seeming
graciousness
she
was
consumed
by
murderous
fury
one
thought
alone
possessed
her
that
of
suppressing
that
man
and
she
dreamt
of
devising
some
catastrophe
in
which
he
might
perish
eight
months
had
now
gone
by
since
josine
had
bidden
farewell
to
luc
and
since
that
time
she
had
become
ragu
had
discovered
the
truth
one
day
when
in
a
fit
of
drunkenness
he
had
wished
to
beat
her
he
himself
had
reverted
to
his
old
life
of
debauchery
leading
astray
all
the
factory
girls
who
were
foolish
enough
to
listen
to
him
and
utterly
neglecting
his
own
wife
thus
his
discovery
both
amazed
and
exasperated
him
and
terrible
scenes
followed
it
at
first
he
had
recourse
to
brutality
and
it
was
a
wonder
that
josine
escaped
alive
then
he
kept
her
shut
up
for
days
together
or
else
watched
her
every
movement
he
had
long
spoken
of
casting
her
into
the
streets
he
had
long
neglected
her
for
the
most
shameless
of
creatures
but
at
present
he
quivered
with
jealous
fury
whenever
he
saw
her
speaking
with
any
man
out
of
doors
he
tried
by
every
means
he
could
devise
to
wring
from
her
her
lover
name
but
this
she
steadfastly
refused
to
tell
him
whatever
might
be
his
threats
his
violence
or
his
promises
for
after
striking
her
he
would
sometimes
exclaim
me
his
name
tell
me
his
name
and
i
promise
you
that
i
leave
you
alone
no
suspicion
of
luc
entered
ragu
mind
for
nobody
apart
from
sÅurette
was
aware
of
josine
visit
to
the
pavilion
thus
ragu
sought
the
culprit
among
his
own
mates
but
however
much
he
might
watch
however
much
he
might
question
he
learnt
nothing
and
the
efforts
he
made
in
this
respect
only
increased
his
fury
josine
meantime
hid
herself
as
much
as
possible
she
dreaded
the
result
for
luc
should
the
truth
be
discovered
so
far
as
she
was
personally
concerned
she
was
overjoyed
by
what
had
happened
and
would
have
gladly
hastened
to
her
lover
to
tell
him
of
it
but
fears
for
his
safety
came
upon
her
and
she
thought
that
it
was
best
to
wait
in
such
wise
that
a
chance
meeting
alone
apprised
luc
of
the
truth
and
even
then
josine
was
only
able
to
acquaint
him
with
her
secret
by
a
gesture
for
others
were
present
and
it
was
impossible
for
the
lovers
to
exchange
a
word
filled
with
emotion
by
the
tidings
thus
imparted
to
him
luc
sought
for
further
information
and
soon
heard
of
ragu
wrath
and
violence
and
of
the
close
watch
which
he
kept
upon
josine
had
he
luc
retained
any
doubts
on
the
matter
the
other
ferocious
jealousy
and
exasperation
would
have
sufficed
to
destroy
them
from
that
moment
he
regarded
josine
as
his
own
wife
she
was
his
and
his
alone
since
she
was
soon
to
become
a
mother
and
the
father
of
the
child
and
not
the
other
was
the
real
and
sole
husband
ragu
had
vowed
that
he
would
never
be
burdened
with
children
and
thus
there
was
no
bond
whatever
between
him
and
josine
there
can
indeed
be
but
one
bond
between
man
and
woman
one
firm
and
eternal
bond
the
bond
which
comes
from
the
birth
of
a
child
apart
from
that
whatever
human
laws
may
say
there
is
no
real
union
no
real
marriage
thus
josine
now
for
ever
belonged
to
luc
alone
and
assuredly
she
would
come
back
to
him
and
the
child
would
be
the
living
florescence
of
their
love
all
the
same
luc
suffered
terribly
when
he
learnt
that
josine
was
constantly
being
reviled
and
ever
in
danger
of
receiving
some
dastardly
blow
it
was
unbearable
to
the
young
man
that
he
should
have
to
leave
that
fondly
loved
woman
in
the
clutches
of
ragu
when
he
longed
to
set
her
in
a
paradise
of
affection
but
what
could
he
do
since
she
so
stubbornly
cloistered
herself
in
order
to
spare
him
all
embarrassment
and
worry
she
even
refused
to
see
him
for
fear
of
some
surprise
that
would
have
revealed
the
secret
which
she
so
tenderly
buried
in
the
depths
of
her
dolorous
heart
thus
luc
had
to
watch
for
her
in
order
to
be
able
to
say
a
few
words
at
last
one
very
dark
evening
while
hiding
in
a
dim
corner
of
the
wretched
rue
des
trois
lunes
he
was
able
to
stop
her
for
a
moment
as
she
was
passing
luc
is
it
you
how
imprudent
she
gasped
me
and
run
off
i
beg
you
but
he
quivering
had
clasped
her
round
the
waist
and
was
whispering
passionately
no
josine
i
want
to
tell
you
you
are
suffering
too
much
and
it
is
criminal
of
me
to
leave
you
who
are
so
dear
so
precious
in
such
suffering
listen
josine
i
have
come
to
fetch
you
and
you
must
come
with
me
so
that
i
may
place
you
in
my
home
your
home
like
a
happy
woman
she
was
already
yielding
to
his
gentle
and
consoling
embrace
but
all
at
once
she
freed
herself
what
are
you
saying
luc
have
you
no
more
reason
than
that
she
asked
you
good
heavens
when
that
would
be
confession
and
would
draw
the
greatest
dangers
down
upon
you
it
is
i
who
would
then
be
acting
wrongly
criminally
creating
embarrassment
for
you
in
the
work
that
you
are
accomplishing
be
off
quick
he
may
try
to
kill
me
but
i
will
never
never
give
him
your
name
at
this
luc
tried
to
convince
her
of
the
uselessness
of
such
a
sacrifice
to
the
hypocrisy
of
the
world
are
my
wife
since
i
am
the
father
of
your
child
said
he
me
it
is
that
you
ought
to
follow
by
when
our
city
of
justice
is
built
there
will
be
no
other
law
save
that
of
love
and
our
union
will
be
respected
by
one
and
all
why
should
we
trouble
about
the
people
whom
we
may
scandalise
then
as
she
seemed
stubbornly
bent
on
sacrifice
saying
that
she
took
only
the
present
into
account
for
she
wished
him
to
be
spared
all
obstacles
in
order
that
he
might
become
powerful
and
triumphant
he
raised
a
cry
of
grief
will
you
never
return
to
me
then
will
that
child
never
be
mine
in
the
presence
of
one
and
all
again
she
clasped
him
with
her
delicate
endearing
arms
and
with
her
lips
near
his
she
softly
murmured
will
come
back
on
the
day
when
you
need
me
when
i
shall
be
not
a
source
of
embarrassment
but
a
help
and
then
i
will
bring
with
me
that
dear
child
whose
presence
will
endow
us
both
with
increase
of
strength
black
beauclair
the
old
pestilential
den
of
accursed
toil
lay
around
them
agonising
in
the
darkness
beneath
the
crushing
weight
of
its
centuries
of
iniquity
whilst
those
words
instinct
with
hope
in
a
future
of
peace
and
happiness
were
spoken
are
my
husband
resumed
josine
alone
will
have
formed
part
of
my
life
and
ah
if
you
only
knew
with
what
delight
i
refrain
from
speaking
your
name
no
matter
how
much
i
may
be
threatened
i
keep
it
secret
like
a
hidden
flower
like
hidden
armour
too
oh
do
not
pity
me
i
am
strong
and
i
am
very
happy
and
luc
made
answer
are
my
wife
i
loved
you
on
the
very
first
evening
when
i
met
you
so
wretched
yet
so
divine
and
if
you
keep
my
name
secret
so
will
i
keep
yours
it
shall
be
my
worship
and
my
strength
till
you
yourself
deem
it
time
to
cry
our
love
aloud
luc
how
good
how
reasonable
you
are
and
how
happy
we
shall
be
is
you
josine
who
have
made
me
good
and
reasonable
and
it
is
because
i
succoured
you
one
evening
that
we
shall
be
so
very
happy
later
on
amidst
the
happiness
of
all
without
again
speaking
they
remained
yet
another
moment
linked
in
a
close
embrace
then
josine
freed
herself
and
returned
glorious
and
invincible
to
martyrdom
whilst
luc
disappeared
amidst
the
gloom
strengthened
by
that
interview
and
ready
to
resume
the
battle
which
would
lead
to
victory
a
few
weeks
later
however
chance
placed
josine
secret
in
fernande
hands
fernande
knew
ragu
whose
sudden
return
to
the
abyss
had
created
quite
a
sensation
there
in
such
wise
that
delaveau
had
made
a
pretence
of
esteeming
him
and
had
even
appointed
him
and
favoured
him
in
other
ways
although
his
conduct
was
execrable
that
fernande
should
have
heard
of
the
drama
which
had
upset
ragu
home
was
not
surprising
he
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
conceal
the
facts
but
openly
denounced
his
wife
as
a
shameless
creature
with
the
result
that
the
affair
became
a
common
subject
of
conversation
in
the
workshops
it
was
even
spoken
about
at
the
manager
house
and
one
day
in
fernande
presence
delaveau
expressed
his
great
annoyance
at
it
all
for
ragu
now
that
he
was
wild
with
jealousy
worked
like
a
madman
at
times
never
touching
a
tool
for
three
days
in
succession
and
at
others
rushing
upon
his
task
and
stirring
the
fusing
metal
with
all
the
fury
of
a
man
who
is
seized
with
a
longing
to
strike
and
kill
at
last
one
winter
morning
when
delaveau
was
absent
in
paris
whither
he
had
gone
the
previous
day
fernande
questioned
her
maid
who
had
just
brought
her
the
tea
and
toast
which
composed
her
first
breakfast
nise
was
seated
there
drinking
her
own
milk
and
casting
covetous
eyes
at
her
mother
tea
for
tea
was
a
thing
which
she
was
not
usually
allowed
to
drink
though
she
was
very
fond
of
it
it
true
fÃ©licie
fernande
inquired
the
ragus
have
been
quarrelling
again
the
laundress
told
me
that
ragu
had
half
killed
his
wife
do
know
if
that
so
madame
replied
the
maid
i
think
she
must
have
exaggerated
for
i
saw
josine
pass
the
house
a
little
while
ago
and
she
looked
no
worse
than
she
usually
does
a
pause
followed
and
then
the
maid
as
she
went
off
added
the
same
it
pretty
certain
that
he
will
end
by
killing
her
one
of
these
days
he
tells
everybody
that
he
means
to
do
so
silence
fell
again
and
fernande
slowly
ate
her
toast
absorbed
the
while
in
a
gloomy
reverie
but
all
at
once
amidst
the
heavy
stillness
nise
letting
her
thoughts
escape
her
unawares
began
to
hum
in
an
undertone
is
josine
real
husband
her
husband
is
monsieur
luc
monsieur

monsieur
luc
at
this
her
mother
raised
her
eyes
in
stupefaction
and
gazed
at
the
child
fixedly
is
that
you
are
saying
nise
she
exclaimed
are
you
saying
it
thunderstruck
at
having
unwittingly
hummed
those
words
aloud
nise
lowered
her
face
over
her
cup
and
strove
to
assume
an
innocent
air
for
nothing
i
do
know
do
know
you
little
you
certainly
did
not
make
up
those
words
yourself
if
you
repeat
them
somebody
must
have
told
them
you
nise
although
she
was
becoming
more
and
more
disturbed
feeling
that
she
had
landed
herself
in
a
nasty
scrape
which
might
have
consequences
nevertheless
held
out
against
all
evidence
assure
you
mamma
said
she
in
the
most
artless
manner
that
she
could
assume
sings
things
without
knowing
just
as
they
come
into
head
then
fernande
seeing
her
repeat
her
fib
with
all
the
demeanour
of
a
genuine
suddenly
felt
enlightened
was
nanet
who
told
you
what
you
sang
it
can
only
have
been
nanet
nise
blinked
it
was
indeed
nanet
who
had
told
her
but
she
was
afraid
of
being
again
scolded
and
punished
as
on
the
day
when
her
mother
had
caught
her
returning
from
la
crÃªcherie
with
paul
boisgelin
and
louise
mazelle
by
climbing
over
the
wall
so
she
persisted
in
her
falsehood
nanet
nanet
but
i
have
seen
him
at
all
since
you
forbade
it
feverishly
desirous
of
ascertaining
the
truth
her
mother
suddenly
assumed
great
gentleness
of
manner
such
was
her
emotion
that
she
forgot
all
question
of
scolding
nise
escapades
with
nanet
being
of
little
moment
compared
with
the
important
matter
on
which
she
desired
full
enlightenment
little
girl
she
said
is
very
wrong
to
tell
falsehoods
that
day
when
i
said
that
you
should
have
no
dessert
it
was
because
you
wanted
to
make
me
believe
that
you
and
the
others
had
climbed
over
the
wall
simply
to
fetch
a
ball
well
if
you
tell
me
the
truth
i
promise
that
you
shall
not
be
punished
come
be
frank
it
was
nanet
nise
who
at
bottom
was
a
good
little
girl
immediately
replied
mamma
it
nanet
he
told
you
that
josine
real
husband
was
monsieur
luc
mamma
pray
what
does
he
know
about
it
why
does
he
say
that
monsieur
luc
is
josine
real
husband
thereupon
nise
became
perplexed
and
innocently
lowered
her
face
over
her
cup
again
he
knows
he
knows
well
he
says
he
knows
it
greatly
as
fernande
desired
to
obtain
precise
information
on
the
subject
she
felt
that
she
could
not
put
any
further
questions
to
her
child
and
by
way
of
precaution
she
sought
to
destroy
the
effect
of
the
eager
curiosity
which
she
had
hitherto
displayed
knows
nothing
she
said
talks
foolishly
and
you
are
a
little
stupid
to
repeat
what
he
says
do
go
singing
such
silly
things
again
or
else
you
shall
never
have
any
dessert
at
all
then
the
meal
was
finished
in
silence
the
mother
absorbed
in
what
she
had
learnt
and
the
child
well
pleased
at
having
escaped
so
lightly
fernande
spent
the
day
in
her
room
reflecting
she
began
by
asking
herself
if
what
nanet
had
said
could
really
be
the
truth
but
how
was
she
to
doubt
it
the
lad
had
certainly
heard
something
discovered
something
and
he
was
too
much
attached
to
his
sister
to
tell
any
falsehood
about
her
moreover
a
number
of
little
incidents
which
fernande
now
recalled
rendered
the
story
quite
probable
in
fact
certain
but
then
how
could
she
make
use
of
the
weapon
which
chance
had
placed
in
her
hand
in
a
confused
way
she
dreamt
of
steeping
that
weapon
in
poison
so
as
to
render
it
deadly
never
had
she
hated
luc
so
much
as
she
hated
him
now
if
delaveau
was
at
present
in
paris
it
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
negotiate
a
fresh
loan
for
the
abyss
was
sinking
a
little
more
each
day
how
great
then
would
be
her
victory
if
she
could
succeed
in
suppressing
the
hated
master
of
la
crÃªcherie
the
man
who
threatened
her
life
of
luxury
and
pleasure
the
enemy
killed
the
competition
would
be
killed
as
well
with
such
a
man
as
ragu
a
drunkard
full
of
jealousy
and
wrath
a
prompt
finish
might
be
expected
it
would
doubtless
suffice
to
inflame
him
to
prompt
him
to
draw
his
knife
but
then
again
how
was
she
to
bring
this
about
how
was
she
to
act
the
proper
course
was
evidently
to
warn
ragu
to
acquaint
him
with
the
name
of
the
man
whom
he
had
been
trying
to
discover
for
three
months
past
then
however
came
a
difficulty
how
was
she
to
warn
him
where
and
by
whom
at
first
she
thought
of
sending
him
an
anonymous
letter
and
decided
that
she
would
cut
the
words
she
needed
out
of
some
old
newspaper
paste
them
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
post
the
letter
in
the
evening
she
had
indeed
already
begun
to
cut
out
such
words
as
she
desired
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
her
plan
might
not
prove
efficacious
for
ragu
might
pay
little
heed
to
a
letter
whereas
it
was
necessary
to
exasperate
him
if
he
were
not
excited
fired
to
the
point
of
madness
perhaps
he
would
never
strike
the
truth
must
be
cast
at
him
like
a
blow
a
whip
stroke
in
the
face
and
under
such
circumstances
as
might
madden
him
but
whom
could
she
send
whom
could
she
choose
to
poison
the
man
mind
when
night
came
and
she
went
to
bed
she
had
grown
convinced
that
there
was
nobody
whom
she
could
employ
and
that
she
herself
must
speak
the
fatal
words
chance
favoured
her
in
this
design
her
husband
was
absent
and
on
awaking
at
an
early
hour
she
was
able
to
go
down
and
waylay
ragu
as
he
quitted
the
night
shift
she
had
an
excuse
quite
ready
she
would
tell
him
that
she
wanted
a
woman
to
do
some
needlework
and
had
thought
of
employing
his
wife
if
he
were
willing
to
let
her
come
that
proposal
would
enable
her
to
raise
the
subject
which
she
had
at
heart
and
indeed
at
the
first
words
that
fernande
addressed
to
him
with
respect
to
his
wife
ragu
burst
into
invectives
and
when
she
in
a
seemingly
innocent
way
declared
that
she
imagined
he
had
become
reconciled
to
the
position
for
she
had
heard
that
the
child
was
to
be
provided
for
by
its
father
monsieur
luc
the
man
fury
became
uncontrollable
the
die
was
cast
and
it
was
certain
that
he
would
wreak
summary
vengeance
for
there
was
murder
in
his
glance
as
he
wildly
rushed
away
it
was
nearly
nine
and
the
pale
morning
light
of
winter
was
rising
when
luc
was
stabbed
by
ragu
the
former
was
about
to
pay
his
usual
morning
visit
to
the
school
his
greatest
daily
pleasure
when
ragu
who
had
been
watching
for
him
secreted
the
while
behind
a
clump
of
spindle
trees
suddenly
sprang
forward
and
thrust
his
knife
into
his
back
between
his
shoulders
luc
standing
at
that
moment
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
school
laughing
with
some
of
the
little
girls
who
had
come
forward
to
meet
him
gave
a
loud
cry
and
fell
to
the
ground
whilst
his
assailant
fled
up
the
bleuse
mountains
where
he
disappeared
amidst
the
rocks
and
the
bushes
as
it
happened
sÅurette
had
not
yet
arrived
she
was
busy
at
the
dairy
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
the
children
present
fled
in
their
terror
calling
for
help
and
shrieking
that
ragu
had
just
killed
monsieur
luc
some
minutes
elapsed
however
before
some
of
the
men
of
the
works
heard
these
calls
and
were
able
to
pick
up
the
stricken
man
who
had
swooned
away
the
blood
that
had
gushed
from
him
already
formed
quite
a
pool
and
the
steps
of
the
right
wing
of
the
which
the
school
occupied
seemed
to
have
been
baptized
with
gore
for
the
time
being
nobody
thought
of
pursuing
ragu
who
must
have
been
far
away
already
the
attention
of
one
and
all
was
given
to
luc
who
just
as
the
men
were
about
to
carry
him
into
a
hall
adjoining
the
emerged
from
his
swoon
and
gasped
in
a
faint
entreating
voice
no
to
my
home
my
friends
they
had
to
obey
him
and
carry
him
to
the
pavilion
on
a
stretcher
but
it
was
only
with
difficulty
that
they
were
able
to
lay
him
on
his
bed
and
then
such
was
the
agony
he
experienced
that
he
again
lost
consciousness
at
that
moment
sÅurette
arrived
one
of
the
little
girls
retaining
her
presence
of
mind
had
gone
to
warn
her
at
the
dairy
whilst
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
workmen
ran
down
to
beauclair
in
order
to
fetch
doctor
novarre
when
sÅurette
entered
the
pavilion
and
saw
luc
lying
there
with
his
face
quite
white
and
his
body
covered
with
blood
she
believed
him
to
be
dead
thus
she
at
once
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
the
bedstead
a
prey
to
such
keen
grief
that
the
secret
of
her
love
escaped
her
she
took
hold
of
one
of
luc
inert
hands
and
kissed
it
and
sobbed
and
stammered
forth
all
the
passion
against
which
she
had
battled
and
which
she
had
buried
deep
within
her
in
losing
him
she
felt
that
she
was
losing
her
own
heart
she
would
love
no
more
she
would
be
unable
to
live
another
day
and
amidst
her
despair
she
did
not
perceive
that
luc
upon
whom
her
tears
were
falling
had
at
last
recovered
consciousness
and
was
listening
to
her
with
infinite
affection
infinite
tenderness
at
last
he
faintly
breathed
the
words
love
me
ah
poor
poor
sÅurette
full
of
blissful
surprise
at
finding
him
yet
alive
sÅurette
regretted
nought
of
her
confession
rather
was
she
delighted
at
no
longer
having
to
lie
to
him
for
she
felt
that
her
love
was
so
great
and
so
lofty
it
would
never
bring
suffering
on
him
i
love
you
luc
she
gasped
do
i
count
i
you
live
and
that
is
sufficient
i
am
not
jealous
of
your
happiness
oh
luc
you
must
live
you
must
live
and
i
will
be
your
servant
at
that
tragic
moment
when
death
seemed
so
near
at
hand
the
discovery
of
sÅurette
mute
and
absolute
love
which
had
long
surrounded
and
accompanied
him
like
that
of
some
guardian
angel
filled
luc
with
immense
but
dolorous
rapture
poor
sÅurette
oh
my
divine
sad
friend
he
murmured
in
his
failing
voice
but
the
door
opened
and
doctor
novarre
entered
in
a
state
of
keen
emotion
he
immediately
wished
to
examine
the
wound
with
the
assistance
of
sÅurette
with
whose
skill
as
a
nurse
he
was
well
acquainted
deep
silence
fell
there
came
a
moment
of
inexpressible
anguish
then
followed
relief
a
glow
of
hope
the
knife
had
struck
the
and
had
swerved
reaching
no
vital
organ
but
simply
gashing
the
flesh
at
the
same
time
the
wound
was
a
frightful
one
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
bone
might
be
broken
in
which
event
complications
might
arise
even
if
there
were
no
immediate
danger
convalescence
would
at
all
events
be
a
long
time
coming
yet
how
joyful
was
the
thought
that
death
had
been
averted
luc
was
holding
sÅurette
hand
and
smiling
feebly
at
the
sight
of
her
happiness
my
good
jordan
does
he
know
of
it
he
asked
he
knows
nothing
as
yet
for
three
days
past
he
has
shut
himself
up
in
his
laboratory
but
i
will
bring
him
to
you
ah
my
friend
how
happy
the
doctor
assurance
makes
me
in
her
rapture
sÅurette
still
let
her
hand
rest
in
luc
when
once
again
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
this
time
it
was
josine
who
entered
at
the
first
news
of
the
crime
she
had
hastened
to
the
spot
distracted
wild
with
grief
that
which
she
had
feared
had
happened
some
scoundrel
had
surprised
and
revealed
her
secret
and
ragu
had
killed
luc
her
husband
the
father
of
her
child
her
life
was
over
there
was
nothing
more
for
her
to
hide
she
would
die
there
in
her
real
home
luc
raised
a
light
cry
at
the
sight
of
her
and
quickly
dropping
sÅurette
hand
he
held
out
both
his
arms
josine
he
gasped
is
you
you
have
come
back
to
me
then
as
she
staggering
forward
sank
down
beside
him
he
understood
her
anguish
and
sought
to
reassure
her
not
grieve
he
said
have
come
back
to
me
with
the
dear
little
one
and
i
shall
live
the
doctor
tells
me
so
live
for
both
of
you
she
listened
and
drew
a
long
breath
as
though
recovering
life
had
she
then
reached
the
realisation
of
her
hopes
that
which
she
had
awaited
from
life
which
seems
so
harsh
whilst
it
accomplishes
its
needful
work
he
would
live
and
it
was
that
abominable
which
brought
them
together
once
more
they
who
were
already
for
ever
linked
one
to
the
other
yes
i
have
come
back
to
you
luc
she
said
it
is
all
over
we
shall
never
part
again
since
now
we
have
nothing
more
to
hide
remember
that
i
promised
to
return
to
you
whenever
you
might
have
need
of
me
whenever
i
should
no
longer
be
a
source
of
embarrassment
to
you
all
other
ties
are
severed
i
am
your
wife
before
one
and
all
and
my
place
is
here
at
your
bedside
luc
was
so
moved
so
thrilled
with
rapture
that
tears
gathered
in
his
eyes
dear
dear
josine
love
and
happiness
have
come
with
you
but
all
at
once
he
remembered
sÅurette
and
then
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
her
standing
erect
once
more
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
and
although
she
looked
very
pale
she
was
smiling
with
an
affectionate
gesture
he
took
hold
of
her
hand
again
good
sÅurette
he
said
was
a
secret
which
i
was
compelled
to
hide
from
you
she
shivered
slightly
then
simply
answered
i
knew
it
i
had
seen
josine
leave
the
pavilion
one
morning
you
knew
it
then
he
divined
everything
and
the
compassion
the
admiration
the
affection
he
felt
for
her
became
infinite
her
renunciation
of
hope
the
love
which
she
still
retained
for
him
and
which
she
manifested
in
boundless
affection
in
a
gift
of
her
whole
life
touched
him
like
an
act
of
the
loftiest
heroism
drawing
quite
close
to
him
she
whispered
no
fear
luc
i
knew
it
and
i
shall
never
be
aught
but
the
most
devoted
and
most
sisterly
of
friends
sÅurette
he
repeated
in
so
faint
a
breath
that
he
could
scarcely
be
heard
my
divine
sad
friend
noticing
his
exhaustion
doctor
novarre
intervened
and
forbade
any
further
talking
the
doctor
smiled
discreetly
at
all
that
he
had
learnt
at
that
bedside
it
was
very
nice
that
the
injured
man
should
have
a
sister
a
wife
to
nurse
him
but
it
was
necessary
to
be
reasonable
and
to
refrain
from
encouraging
fever
by
excess
of
emotion
luc
promised
however
that
he
would
be
very
good
he
spoke
no
more
but
only
turned
soft
glances
upon
josine
and
sÅurette
his
two
good
angels
who
stood
one
on
the
right
the
other
on
the
left
of
his
bed
a
long
pause
followed
the
blood
of
the
reformer
had
flowed
and
this
was
the
calvary
the
passion
whence
triumph
would
arise
as
the
two
women
moved
gently
around
him
the
injured
man
opened
his
eyes
to
smile
at
them
again
then
he
fell
asleep
murmuring
has
come
at
last
and
now
we
shall
be
the
conquerors
v
before
long
complications
arose
and
luc
barely
escaped
the
clutches
of
death
for
a
couple
of
days
it
was
thought
that
he
was
dying
josine
and
sÅurette
never
quitted
him
and
jordan
came
to
seat
himself
beside
the
bed
of
anguish
thus
forsaking
his
laboratory
a
thing
which
he
had
not
done
since
his
mother
last
illness
and
how
great
was
the
despair
of
those
loving
hearts
which
from
hour
to
hour
expected
to
see
their
dear
one
drawing
his
last
breath
the
which
ragu
had
dealt
luc
had
quite
upset
la
crÃªcherie
work
went
on
in
the
mourning
workshops
but
at
every
moment
the
men
desired
tidings
there
was
great
solidarity
among
them
and
all
felt
an
anxious
affection
for
the
victim
of
that
crime
which
did
more
to
tighten
the
bonds
of
fraternity
between
them
than
many
years
of
experimental
humanitarianism
even
in
beauclair
sympathy
became
apparent
a
great
many
people
there
felt
for
that
young
handsome
and
active
man
whose
one
crime
apart
from
his
work
of
justice
consisted
in
having
loved
a
very
charming
woman
who
had
been
incessantly
reviled
and
beaten
by
her
husband
briefly
nobody
seemed
to
be
scandalised
at
seeing
josine
instal
herself
at
luc
bedside
it
was
indeed
thought
quite
natural
for
was
he
not
the
father
of
the
child
and
had
they
not
purchased
at
the
cost
of
many
tears
the
right
to
live
together
on
the
other
hand
the
gendarmes
despatched
after
ragu
had
found
no
trace
of
him
for
a
fortnight
all
the
researches
proved
fruitless
but
at
last
in
the
depths
of
a
ravine
of
the
bleuse
mountains
the
remains
of
a
man
half
devoured
by
wolves
were
discovered
and
in
these
remains
the
searchers
asserted
that
they
could
recognise
the
body
of
ragu
it
was
impossible
to
draw
up
a
death
certificate
on
such
evidence
but
a
legend
arose
to
the
effect
that
ragu
had
perished
either
accidentally
or
by
suicide
amidst
the
furious
madness
born
of
his
crime
in
this
case
if
josine
were
a
widow
why
should
she
not
live
with
luc
and
why
should
not
the
jordans
accept
the
situation
the
union
of
the
young
couple
seemed
so
natural
so
firm
so
indissoluble
that
later
on
the
idea
that
they
were
not
legally
married
occurred
to
nobody
at
last
one
bright
february
morning
doctor
novarre
declared
that
he
thought
he
might
answer
for
luc
and
indeed
a
few
days
later
the
latter
was
quite
convalescent
then
josine
who
had
not
spared
herself
throughout
his
illness
in
her
turn
required
to
be
nursed
for
she
gave
birth
to
a
vigorous
boy
named
by
his
parents
hilaire
during
the
weeks
which
followed
luc
often
spent
an
hour
seated
in
an
near
josine
bed
the
early
springtide
filled
the
room
with
sunshine
on
the
table
there
was
always
a
fresh
bunch
of
lovely
roses
which
the
doctor
brought
from
his
garden
like
a
prescription
of
youth
health
and
beauty
as
he
was
wont
to
say
between
the
parents
was
the
cradle
occupied
by
little
hilaire
whom
josine
herself
nursed
yet
greater
strength
and
hope
than
they
had
previously
known
now
flowered
from
their
lives
in
the
person
of
that
child
as
luc
constantly
repeated
amidst
the
many
plans
for
the
future
in
which
he
indulged
pending
the
time
when
he
might
set
to
work
once
more
he
was
now
at
ease
convinced
that
he
would
found
the
city
of
justice
and
peace
since
in
josine
and
hilaire
he
had
love
fruitful
love
upon
his
side
nothing
is
founded
without
a
child
a
child
is
living
work
the
broadening
and
the
propagation
of
life
the
assurance
that
will
duly
follow
the
mated
couple
alone
brings
life
alone
works
for
human
happiness
and
will
alone
save
poor
men
from
iniquity
and
wretchedness
on
the
first
day
when
josine
erect
once
more
was
able
to
begin
her
new
life
by
the
side
of
luc
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
exclaiming
you
are
mine
alone
your
child
is
mine
also
and
now
we
are
perfected
and
fear
nothing
more
from
fate
as
soon
as
luc
was
able
to
resume
the
management
of
the
works
the
sympathy
which
had
gone
out
to
him
on
all
sides
helped
him
to
accomplish
prodigies
moreover
it
was
not
only
the
baptism
of
blood
which
brought
about
the
success
of
la
crÃªcherie
a
success
which
now
ever
increased
continuously
and
invincibly
there
was
also
a
lucky
discovery
the
mine
once
more
became
a
source
of
great
wealth
for
they
fell
at
last
upon
considerable
lodes
of
excellent
ore
thus
proving
that
morfain
had
been
right
from
that
time
forward
iron
and
steel
were
turned
out
of
such
excellent
quality
and
at
such
a
low
cost
that
the
abyss
was
even
threatened
in
its
manufacture
of
superfine
articles
all
competition
became
impossible
and
then
there
was
also
the
effect
of
the
great
democratic
movement
which
now
tended
on
all
sides
to
an
increase
in
the
means
of
communication
to
an
endless
extension
of
railway
lines
and
to
the
erection
of
bridges
buildings
whole
cities
indeed
in
which
iron
and
steel
were
employed
to
a
prodigious
and
ever
larger
and
larger
extent
since
the
days
of
the
first
vulcans
who
had
smelted
ore
in
a
pit
for
the
purpose
of
forging
weapons
to
defend
themselves
and
conquer
dominion
over
beings
and
things
the
employment
of
iron
had
been
steadily
spreading
and
when
its
conquest
by
science
should
be
perfect
when
it
would
be
possible
to
work
it
for
next
to
nothing
and
adapt
it
to
all
usages
iron
itself
would
become
a
source
of
justice
and
peace
that
however
which
more
particularly
brought
about
the
prosperity
and
triumph
of
la
crÃªcherie
was
its
improved
management
into
which
there
entered
increase
of
truth
equity
and
solidarity
its
success
had
been
certain
from
the
day
when
it
had
been
founded
on
the
provisional
system
of
an
association
between
capital
labour
and
intelligence
and
the
difficult
days
through
which
it
had
passed
the
obstacles
of
all
kinds
the
various
crises
which
had
been
deemed
deadly
were
simply
so
many
inevitable
jolts
upon
the
road
during
the
first
trying
days
of
the
advance
when
it
is
necessary
that
one
should
brace
oneself
for
resistance
if
one
desires
to
attain
goal
all
this
was
now
clearly
manifest
the
enterprise
had
ever
been
full
of
life
laden
with
sap
whence
the
harvests
of
the
future
would
spring
the
works
were
now
like
a
practical
lesson
a
decisive
experiment
which
would
gradually
convince
everybody
how
was
it
possible
to
deny
the
strength
of
that
association
of
capital
labour
and
intelligence
when
the
profits
became
larger
from
year
to
year
and
the
workmen
of
la
crÃªcherie
earned
twice
as
much
as
those
of
other
establishments
how
could
one
do
otherwise
than
admit
that
eight
hours
six
hours
three
hours
work
work
rendered
attractive
by
variety
and
accomplished
in
bright
gay
workshops
with
the
help
of
machinery
which
children
might
have
directed
was
the
fundamental
principle
necessary
for
future
society
when
one
saw
the
wretched
of
yesterday
born
anew
becoming
healthy
intelligent
cheerful
and
gentle
men
again
as
things
progressed
towards
complete
liberty
and
justice
how
also
could
one
do
otherwise
than
conclude
in
favour
of
the
necessity
of
which
would
suppress
all
intermediary
parasitic
growths
mere
trading
in
which
so
much
wealth
and
strength
is
swallowed
up
when
the
general
stores
of
la
crÃªcherie
worked
so
smoothly
ever
increasing
the
comfort
of
those
who
yesterday
had
been
famished
and
loading
them
with
enjoyments
hitherto
reserved
for
the
rich
alone
how
again
could
one
do
otherwise
than
believe
in
the
prodigies
accomplished
by
solidarity
which
renders
life
so
pleasant
and
makes
it
a
continual
festival
for
one
and
all
when
one
attended
the
happy
meetings
at
the
destined
to
become
the
people
royal
palace
with
its
libraries
its
museums
its
its
gardens
and
its
many
diversions
and
how
could
one
do
otherwise
than
renew
the
whole
system
of
educating
and
rearing
children
in
such
wise
that
this
system
should
no
longer
be
based
on
a
theory
of
the
innate
idleness
of
man
but
on
his
inextinguishable
craving
for
knowledge
and
how
refuse
to
render
study
agreeable
and
leave
each
pupil
in
possession
of
his
individual
energy
and
allow
the
two
sexes
to
mingle
from
infancy
since
they
are
destined
to
share
life
side
by
side
when
one
beheld
the
prosperity
of
the
schools
of
la
crÃªcherie
whence
all
excessive
was
banished
where
lessons
were
mingled
with
play
and
rudimentary
notions
of
professional
apprenticeship
so
as
to
help
each
fresh
generation
to
draw
nearer
to
that
ideal
community
towards
which
mankind
has
been
marching
for
so
many
centuries
thus
the
extraordinary
example
which
la
crÃªcherie
day
by
day
displayed
in
the
broad
sunlight
became
contagious
there
was
no
longer
any
question
of
theories
but
one
of
facts
evident
to
the
eyes
of
all
and
naturally
the
association
gained
more
and
more
support
crowds
of
fresh
workmen
presented
themselves
for
admission
attracted
by
the
larger
earnings
the
increase
of
comfort
and
new
buildings
arose
on
all
sides
continually
adding
themselves
to
those
which
had
been
first
erected
in
three
years
the
population
was
doubled
and
the
pace
of
the
progress
was
increased
till
it
became
one
of
incredible
rapidity
this
was
the
city
the
city
of
reorganised
work
restored
to
its
status
of
nobility
the
city
of
happiness
at
last
conquered
springing
naturally
from
the
soil
around
the
works
which
likewise
grew
and
spread
becoming
as
it
were
a
metropolis
a
central
heart
the
source
of
life
dispensing
and
regulating
social
existence
the
workshops
the
great
halls
became
larger
and
larger
until
they
covered
acres
of
ground
whilst
the
little
bright
gay
standing
amidst
the
greenery
of
their
gardens
multiplied
incessantly
even
as
the
number
of
workers
increased
and
this
overflowing
wave
of
new
buildings
advanced
towards
the
abyss
which
it
threatened
to
destroy
and
submerge
at
first
between
the
two
establishments
there
had
been
a
great
bare
space
made
up
of
all
the
uncultivated
land
which
jordan
owned
below
the
ridge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
now
beyond
the
few
houses
first
built
near
la
crÃªcherie
there
had
come
others
and
ever
others
lines
of
houses
invading
everything
like
a
rising
tide
which
only
some
two
or
three
hundred
yards
separated
from
the
abyss
and
whenever
the
waves
might
advance
against
it
would
it
not
be
covered
carried
away
to
be
replaced
by
a
triumphant
florescence
of
health
and
joy
even
old
beauclair
was
threatened
for
one
part
of
the
new
city
was
marching
thither
and
would
sweep
off
that
black
and
den
of
the
workers
that
nest
of
pain
and
pestilence
where
the
lay
at
its
last
gasp
under
the
crumbling
ceilings
of
the
hovels
one
evening
when
luc
stood
gazing
at
his
new
city
which
he
could
already
picture
covering
the
whole
estuary
of
the
brias
gorges
bonnaire
brought
babette
bourron
wife
to
him
said
she
with
her
everlasting
expression
of
good
humour
like
this
monsieur
luc
my
man
would
very
much
like
to
come
back
to
work
at
la
crÃªcherie
only
he
was
bold
enough
to
come
and
speak
to
you
himself
for
he
remembers
that
he
took
himself
off
in
a
very
wrong
fashion
so
come
for
him
then
bonnaire
added
ought
to
forgive
bourron
that
wretched
ragu
led
him
astray
there
no
malice
in
bourron
he
only
weak
and
perhaps
we
can
still
save
him
let
him
come
back
luc
gaily
exclaimed
do
not
desire
the
death
of
a
sinner
rather
the
reverse
how
many
there
are
who
only
take
to
bad
courses
because
they
are
led
to
them
by
their
mates
idlers
and
revellers
whom
they
can
not
resist
bourron
will
be
a
good
recruit
we
make
an
example
of
him
for
the
benefit
of
the
others
never
had
luc
felt
so
happy
bourron
return
seemed
to
him
a
decisive
symptom
albeit
the
man
had
become
a
mediocre
worker
but
then
as
bonnaire
said
would
not
his
redemption
be
a
victory
over
the
and
besides
this
would
mean
another
household
in
the
new
town
another
little
wave
added
to
all
the
others
which
helped
to
swell
the
tide
by
which
the
old
world
would
be
swept
away
some
days
later
bonnaire
again
came
to
ask
luc
to
admit
one
of
the
men
of
the
abyss
on
this
occasion
however
the
recruit
was
such
a
pitiable
one
that
the
former
was
not
disposed
to
insist
on
the
matter
that
poor
fauchard
said
bonnaire
made
up
his
mind
at
last
he
prowled
about
la
crÃªcherie
on
several
occasions
as
you
may
remember
but
he
could
come
to
no
resolution
he
was
afraid
to
choose
to
such
a
degree
had
he
been
brutified
exhausted
by
excessive
labour
ever
the
same
he
no
longer
a
man
you
know
he
simply
an
old
warped
bit
of
mechanism
i
fear
that
we
shall
never
get
anything
good
out
of
him
luc
was
reflecting
recalling
the
first
days
that
he
had
spent
at
beauclair
yes
he
said
know
he
has
a
wife
called
natalie
is
that
so
a
woman
of
complaining
mind
full
of
care
who
is
always
in
search
of
credit
and
he
has
a
fortunÃ©
who
when
i
first
met
him
was
only
sixteen
years
old
and
looked
so
pale
so
bewildered
so
shattered
already
by
mechanical
toil
ah
the
poor
creatures
well
let
all
of
them
come
why
should
they
this
will
be
another
example
even
if
we
can
not
make
fauchard
a
free
and
cheerful
man
again
then
in
a
jocular
joyful
manner
he
added
will
mean
another
family
another
house
added
to
the
others
la
crÃªcherie
is
becoming
populous
eh
do
you
know
bonnaire
we
are
now
on
the
high
road
to
that
beautiful
great
city
of
which
i
used
to
speak
to
you
at
the
very
beginning
when
you
were
so
incredulous
do
you
remember
you
were
anxious
as
to
the
result
of
the
experiment
and
if
you
remained
on
my
side
it
was
chiefly
out
of
gratitude
but
are
you
convinced
now
bonnaire
who
seemed
somewhat
embarrassed
did
not
immediately
reply
at
length
in
his
usual
frank
way
he
said
one
ever
convinced
it
necessary
that
one
should
be
able
to
touch
the
result
with
one
finger
the
works
are
prosperous
no
doubt
our
association
is
growing
the
men
live
in
more
comfort
there
is
a
little
more
justice
and
happiness
but
you
know
my
ideas
monsieur
luc
it
is
still
the
accursed
and
i
do
yet
see
any
realisation
of
collectivism
it
was
only
as
a
theorist
that
bonnaire
now
defended
himself
if
he
did
not
give
up
his
ideas
as
he
expressed
it
he
at
least
showed
admirable
activity
and
courage
in
helping
on
the
work
which
was
going
forward
he
was
the
the
real
leader
whose
brotherly
example
of
solidarity
had
decided
the
battle
in
favour
of
la
crÃªcherie
when
he
appeared
in
the
workshops
looking
so
tall
so
strong
and
so
all
hands
were
stretched
towards
him
and
he
was
more
won
over
to
the
cause
than
he
was
willing
to
admit
for
it
delighted
him
to
see
that
his
comrades
suffered
less
tasted
all
sorts
of
delights
and
dwelt
in
healthy
homes
with
flowers
around
them
after
all
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
not
go
off
without
seeing
the
fulfilment
of
his
life
dream
that
dream
of
a
world
in
which
there
would
be
less
wretchedness
and
more
equity
yes
collectivist
society
said
luc
laughing
for
he
knew
bonnaire
well
shall
bring
it
about
even
in
a
better
way
perhaps
than
many
of
its
partisans
imagine
and
if
we
do
our
children
will
be
confident
bonnaire
and
remember
that
the
future
henceforth
belongs
to
us
since
our
town
is
growing
always
growing
then
with
a
broad
gesture
luc
pointed
to
the
houses
which
stood
among
the
young
trees
and
whose
roofs
of
coloured
faÃ¯ence
showed
so
gaily
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
ever
and
ever
did
he
return
to
those
living
houses
which
seemed
to
rise
from
the
ground
at
his
command
and
which
he
really
pictured
on
the
march
like
some
pacific
army
which
had
set
forth
to
sow
the
future
on
the
ruins
of
old
beauclair
and
the
abyss
if
however
the
industrial
workers
of
la
crÃªcherie
alone
had
triumphed
the
result
would
simply
have
been
a
happy
one
with
consequences
still
open
to
discussion
but
it
was
rendered
decisive
by
the
fact
that
the
peasant
workers
of
les
combettes
triumphed
on
their
side
also
in
the
association
which
had
been
formed
between
the
village
and
the
factory
here
again
there
was
only
a
beginning
but
how
great
was
the
promise
of
prodigious
fortune
since
the
day
when
realising
that
agreement
was
necessary
if
they
were
to
struggle
on
and
live
mayor
lenfant
and
his
assessor
yvonnot
had
become
reconciled
and
had
prevailed
on
all
the
petty
landowners
of
the
village
to
combine
together
in
order
to
constitute
one
large
estate
of
several
hundreds
of
acres
the
land
had
developed
extraordinary
fertility
previously
it
had
seemed
as
if
it
were
becoming
bankrupt
even
like
the
great
plain
of
la
roumagne
which
had
once
been
so
fruitful
and
which
now
presented
such
a
sorry
spectacle
with
its
poor
stunted
meagre
crops
in
point
of
fact
this
was
simply
the
effect
of
man
stubborn
laziness
and
ignorance
his
adherence
to
methods
and
the
lack
of
proper
manure
machinery
and
agreement
thus
what
a
lesson
was
given
to
others
when
the
peasants
of
les
combettes
began
to
cultivate
their
land
in
common
they
purchased
manure
cheaply
and
procured
tools
and
machinery
at
la
crÃªcherie
in
exchange
for
the
bread
wine
and
vegetables
with
which
they
supplied
it
strength
came
to
them
now
that
they
were
no
longer
isolated
but
had
formed
a
solid
and
henceforth
indestructible
bond
between
the
village
and
the
factory
and
this
was
the
reconciliation
between
peasant
and
mechanic
which
for
so
many
years
had
seemed
impossible
the
peasant
supplying
the
corn
that
nourishes
and
the
other
supplying
iron
and
steel
in
order
that
the
land
might
be
sown
with
corn
if
la
crÃªcherie
needed
les
combettes
les
combettes
on
the
other
hand
could
not
have
thriven
without
la
crÃªcherie
at
all
events
union
was
at
last
effected
there
was
a
fruitful
alliance
whence
the
happy
community
of
would
spring
and
what
a
miraculous
spectacle
was
presented
by
that
plain
now
reviving
to
life
a
short
time
previously
it
had
been
almost
abandoned
and
now
it
overflowed
with
crops
amidst
the
other
stretches
of
land
stricken
by
disunion
and
incompetence
les
combettes
formed
as
it
were
a
little
sea
of
rich
verdure
which
the
whole
region
contemplated
at
first
with
stupefaction
and
then
with
envy
such
dryness
such
sterility
yesterday
and
so
much
vigour
and
abundance
why
not
follow
then
the
example
of
the
folk
of
les
combettes
neighbouring
villages
were
already
making
inquiries
and
showing
a
desire
to
join
the
movement
it
was
said
that
the
mayors
of
fleuranges
lignerolles
and
bonneheux
were
drawing
up
articles
of
association
and
collecting
signatures
thus
the
little
green
sea
would
soon
grow
join
other
seas
and
spread
its
waves
of
greenery
afar
until
the
whole
expanse
of
la
roumagne
would
form
but
one
sole
domain
one
sole
pacific
ocean
of
corn
vast
enough
to
nourish
the
whole
of
a
happy
people
for
pleasure
sake
luc
often
took
long
walks
through
those
fertile
fields
and
he
occasionally
met
feuillat
boisgelin
farmer
who
likewise
strolled
about
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
whilst
contemplating
in
his
silent
enigmatical
way
the
growth
of
the
fine
crops
which
sprang
from
that
land
luc
knew
what
a
large
part
feuillat
had
had
in
prompting
lenfant
and
yvonnot
to
take
the
initiative
and
he
was
aware
that
the
farmer
still
advised
them
nowadays
thus
the
young
man
remained
full
of
surprise
at
seeing
in
what
a
lamentable
condition
the
other
left
the
land
which
he
himself
farmed
the
land
belonging
to
la
guerdache
whose
sorry
fields
looked
like
an
uncultivated
desert
beside
the
rich
domain
of
les
combettes
one
morning
as
luc
and
feuillat
were
chatting
whilst
they
sauntered
along
the
road
which
separated
the
two
estates
the
former
could
not
help
remarking
say
feuillat
do
you
feel
ashamed
at
keeping
your
land
in
such
poor
condition
when
over
the
way
your
land
is
so
admirably
cultivated
surely
your
own
interest
ought
to
urge
you
to
active
and
intelligent
work
such
as
i
know
you
to
be
quite
capable
of
at
first
the
farmer
simply
smiled
then
he
fearlessly
spoke
out
monsieur
luc
shame
is
far
too
fine
a
sentiment
for
such
poor
devils
as
we
are
as
for
my
interest
it
is
just
to
get
a
living
and
no
more
out
of
this
land
which
does
not
belong
to
me
that
what
i
do
i
cultivate
it
just
sufficiently
to
procure
bread
i
should
simply
be
a
dupe
if
i
were
to
work
it
properly
manure
it
and
improve
it
for
all
that
would
only
enrich
monsieur
boisgelin
who
each
time
my
lease
expires
is
free
to
turn
me
out
of
doors
no
no
to
make
a
field
a
good
field
it
ought
to
belong
to
oneself
better
still
to
everybody
then
he
began
to
jeer
at
the
folk
who
shouted
to
the
peasants
the
land
love
the
land
no
doubt
he
was
willing
to
love
it
but
all
the
same
he
wished
to
be
loved
in
return
or
rather
he
did
not
desire
to
love
it
for
the
sake
of
others
as
he
repeated
his
father
his
grandfather
and
his
had
loved
it
in
all
good
faith
bending
beneath
the
rod
of
those
who
exploited
them
and
never
drawing
from
it
aught
save
wretchedness
and
tears
for
his
own
part
he
would
have
none
of
the
system
by
which
landlords
ferociously
imposed
upon
their
tenants
that
farming
system
which
meant
that
the
farmer
was
to
love
and
caress
and
fructify
the
soil
in
order
to
increase
the
wealth
a
pause
followed
then
in
a
lower
voice
with
an
expression
of
concentrated
ardour
feuillat
added
yes
the
land
to
everybody
so
that
one
may
love
it
again
and
cultivate
it
properly
for
my
part
i
waiting
greatly
struck
by
these
words
luc
again
glanced
at
the
farmer
close
as
he
might
keep
he
was
evidently
a
man
of
keen
intelligence
behind
the
peasant
who
simply
seemed
unobtrusive
and
somewhat
shy
luc
now
divined
a
skilful
diplomatist
a
precursor
one
who
gazed
into
the
future
and
helped
on
the
experiment
at
les
combettes
with
a
distant
object
known
to
him
alone
in
view
luc
suspected
the
truth
and
wishing
to
make
certain
on
the
point
he
said
if
you
leave
your
land
in
that
condition
it
is
in
part
to
make
people
compare
it
with
the
neighbouring
land
and
understand
the
reasons
of
the
difference
but
is
it
not
all
a
dream
surely
les
combettes
will
never
invade
and
swallow
up
la
guerdache
again
did
feuillat
break
into
a
silent
laugh
then
he
contented
himself
with
saying
big
would
have
to
happen
between
now
and
then
but
after
all
who
knows
i
waiting
they
took
a
few
steps
and
then
with
a
sweeping
gesture
which
embraced
the
whole
scene
the
farmer
resumed
the
same
things
are
moving
do
you
remember
what
a
horrid
view
one
had
from
here
with
all
those
little
patches
of
ground
which
yielded
such
poor
crops
and
now
just
look
with
everything
united
in
one
estate
and
cultivation
in
common
with
the
help
of
machinery
and
science
the
crops
overflow
on
all
sides
ah
it
is
indeed
a
splendid
sight
the
ardent
love
which
he
had
secretly
retained
for
the
soil
was
manifest
at
that
moment
in
the
fire
of
his
glance
and
the
enthusiasm
of
his
voice
and
luc
himself
was
impressed
by
the
great
gust
of
fruitfulness
which
passed
quivering
over
that
sea
of
corn
if
he
felt
so
strong
and
competent
at
la
crÃªcherie
it
was
because
he
now
had
his
granary
and
was
assured
of
bread
through
having
added
a
community
of
peasants
to
his
community
of
industrial
workers
and
the
delight
he
experienced
when
he
saw
his
city
marching
on
its
waves
of
houses
ever
advancing
to
the
conquest
of
the
abyss
and
old
beauclair
was
no
greater
than
that
which
he
felt
when
he
came
to
view
the
fertile
fields
of
les
combettes
which
on
their
side
were
likewise
marching
on
stretching
into
the
neighbouring
fields
and
gradually
spreading
out
into
an
ocean
of
crops
which
would
cover
la
roumagne
from
one
to
the
other
end
here
as
there
the
effort
was
identical
the
same
civilisation
was
coming
mankind
was
marching
towards
truth
justice
peace
and
happiness
the
first
effect
of
la
crÃªcherie
success
was
to
make
the
petty
factories
of
the
region
understand
the
advantage
they
would
reap
by
following
its
example
and
combining
with
it
the
chodorge
works
nail
works
which
purchased
all
their
raw
material
from
their
powerful
neighbours
were
the
first
to
come
to
a
decision
allowing
themselves
to
be
absorbed
by
la
crÃªcherie
in
the
interest
of
both
sides
then
the
hauser
works
which
after
manufacturing
sabres
had
made
scythes
and
sickles
their
specialty
likewise
joined
the
association
forming
as
it
were
a
natural
adjunct
of
the
great
forge
some
difficulties
arose
with
another
establishment
that
of
mirande
who
built
agricultural
machinery
for
one
of
the
two
partners
was
a
reactionist
and
fought
against
all
novelties
but
the
position
of
the
firm
became
so
critical
that
fearing
a
catastrophe
he
withdrew
from
it
and
the
other
partner
hastened
to
save
his
works
by
merging
them
into
those
of
la
crÃªcherie
all
the
establishments
thus
drawn
into
the
movement
of
association
and
solidarity
accepted
the
same
statutes
a
division
of
profits
based
upon
an
alliance
between
capital
work
and
intelligence
they
ended
by
constituting
one
sole
family
made
up
of
various
groups
ever
ready
to
welcome
fresh
adherents
and
in
this
wise
capable
of
spreading
indefinitely
and
in
this
there
was
a
of
society
which
reconstituted
itself
on
the
basis
of
a
new
organisation
of
work
tending
to
the
freedom
and
happiness
of
mankind
beauclair
was
astonished
and
disconcerted
and
its
anxiety
soon
reached
a
climax
what
would
la
crÃªcherie
grow
without
cessation
absorb
every
little
factory
it
might
meet
this
one
that
one
and
then
that
other
and
would
the
town
itself
and
the
immense
plain
beside
it
be
swallowed
up
and
become
the
dependencies
the
domain
the
very
flesh
of
la
crÃªcherie
men
hearts
were
disturbed
and
their
brains
began
to
wonder
in
what
direction
might
lie
the
true
interest
of
one
and
all
and
the
possibility
of
fortune
the
perplexity
of
the
petty
traders
particularly
the
usual
household
purveyors
increased
and
increased
as
day
by
day
their
takings
diminished
it
became
a
question
whether
they
would
not
be
soon
obliged
to
put
up
their
shutters
the
sensation
was
general
when
people
learnt
that
caffiaux
the
grocer
and
taverner
had
come
to
an
arrangement
with
la
crÃªcherie
by
which
his
establishment
would
be
turned
into
a
simple
a
kind
of
branch
of
the
factory
general
stores
caffiaux
had
long
been
regarded
as
the
hireling
of
the
abyss
more
or
less
a
spy
one
who
poisoned
the
worker
with
alcohol
and
then
sold
his
secrets
to
his
masters
for
taverns
are
the
strongest
pillars
of
the
at
all
events
the
man
was
a
suspicious
character
one
who
ever
watched
to
see
which
side
would
prove
victorious
and
who
was
always
prepared
to
commit
some
act
of
treachery
readily
turning
his
coat
with
the
ease
of
one
who
is
by
no
means
partial
to
defeat
thus
the
circumstance
that
he
had
so
jauntily
set
himself
on
the
side
of
la
crÃªcherie
greatly
increased
the
anxiety
of
his
neighbours
who
for
their
own
parts
wished
to
take
up
the
most
profitable
position
as
soon
as
possible
a
pronounced
movement
of
adherence
to
the
association
then
set
in
and
was
destined
to
proceed
more
and
more
rapidly
beautiful
madame
mitaine
the
bakeress
had
not
waited
for
caffiaux
conversion
to
express
approval
of
the
developments
at
la
crÃªcherie
and
she
was
quite
disposed
to
enter
the
association
though
her
establishment
remained
prosperous
thanks
to
the
reputation
for
beauty
and
kindliness
which
she
had
imparted
to
it
butcher
dacheux
alone
persevered
in
obstinate
resistance
full
of
fury
at
the
downfall
of
all
his
cherished
notions
he
declared
that
rather
than
yield
to
the
current
he
would
prefer
to
die
amongst
his
last
quarters
of
beef
on
the
day
when
he
should
no
longer
find
a
disposed
to
buy
them
at
their
proper
price
and
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
this
would
come
to
pass
for
his
customers
were
gradually
deserting
him
and
such
were
his
fits
of
wrath
that
assuredly
he
was
threatened
with
some
sudden
stroke
of
apoplexy
one
day
dacheux
betook
himself
to
laboque
establishment
whither
he
had
begged
madame
mitaine
also
to
repair
it
was
a
question
said
he
of
seeing
to
the
moral
and
commercial
interests
of
the
whole
district
a
rumour
was
current
that
the
laboques
in
order
to
avoid
bankruptcy
were
on
the
point
of
making
peace
with
luc
and
joining
la
crÃªcherie
in
such
a
way
as
to
become
mere
depositaries
of
its
goods
since
the
works
had
been
directly
exchanging
their
iron
and
steel
their
tools
and
machinery
for
the
bread
of
les
combettes
and
the
other
syndicated
villages
the
laboques
had
lost
their
best
customers
the
peasants
of
the
environs
without
counting
the
housewives
and
even
the
of
beauclair
who
effected
great
savings
by
making
their
purchases
at
the
stores
of
la
crÃªcherie
which
luc
by
a
happy
inspiration
had
ended
by
throwing
open
to
everybody
this
meant
the
death
of
trade
such
as
it
had
hitherto
been
understood
such
as
it
was
personified
by
the
middleman
who
intervened
between
producer
and
consumer
increasing
the
cost
of
life
and
living
like
a
parasite
on
the
needs
of
others
and
thus
amidst
their
deserted
bazaar
the
laboques
poured
forth
their
lamentations
when
dacheux
arrived
the
woman
dark
and
scraggy
sat
behind
her
counter
doing
nothing
for
she
lacked
even
the
courage
to
knit
herself
some
stockings
whilst
the
man
with
the
eyes
and
the
snout
of
a
ferret
came
and
went
like
a
soul
in
distress
before
the
full
of
unsold
goods
that
i
hear
cried
the
butcher
flushing
purple
turned
traitor
laboque
so
people
say
you
are
on
the
point
of
surrendering
to
think
of
it
you
who
lost
that
disastrous
lawsuit
you
who
swore
that
you
kill
the
bandit
even
if
it
should
cost
you
your
skin
would
you
now
set
yourself
against
us
then
and
add
to
the
disaster
but
laboque
whose
hopes
were
all
shattered
burst
into
a
rage
quite
enough
worry
just
leave
me
in
peace
he
answered
for
that
idiotic
lawsuit
you
all
urged
me
to
it
and
now
you
do
spend
enough
money
with
me
to
enable
me
to
make
my
monthly
payments
so
you
need
not
come
taunting
me
about
saving
my
skin
and
pointing
to
his
dusty
goods
he
went
on
skin
there
and
if
i
do
come
to
an
arrangement
the
bailiffs
will
be
here
next
wednesday
yes
it
quite
true
since
you
want
me
to
say
it
yes
i
negotiating
with
la
crÃªcherie
i
come
to
an
understanding
with
them
and
i
shall
sign
the
papers
i
was
still
hesitating
but
i
being
worried
beyond
endurance
he
sank
upon
a
chair
whilst
dacheux
quite
thunderstruck
and
almost
choking
was
only
able
to
stammer
oaths
then
in
her
turn
madame
laboque
huddled
up
behind
her
counter
poured
forth
her
plaint
in
a
low
and
monotonous
voice
have
worked
so
hard
to
have
taken
so
much
trouble
when
we
first
started
in
business
and
went
selling
ironmongery
from
village
to
village
and
then
too
all
the
efforts
that
we
had
to
make
here
in
order
to
open
this
shop
and
enlarge
it
from
year
to
year
we
were
rewarded
no
doubt
the
business
prospered
and
we
dreamt
of
buying
a
house
right
in
the
country
and
of
retiring
to
it
and
living
on
our
income
but
now
everything
is
crumbling
away
beauclair
has
gone
mad
though
i
ca
yet
understand
why
why
growled
dacheux
because
the
revolution
has
come
and
the
are
cowards
and
do
even
dare
to
defend
themselves
for
my
part
if
i
hustled
too
much
i
take
my
knives
one
morning
and
then
you
see
something
laboque
shrugged
his
shoulders

of
use
that
would
be
he
exclaimed
all
very
well
when
folk
are
with
one
but
when
a
man
feels
that
he
will
be
left
quite
alone
the
best
is
to
go
where
the
others
are
going
however
much
it
may
enrage
one
to
do
so
caffiaux
understood
it
well
enough
that
filthy
caffiaux

the
butcher
full
of
fury

more

you

know
that
monsieur

bandit
gave
him
a
hundred
thousand

to

the
ironmonger
whose
eyes
glowed
although
he
feigned
ironical
scepticism

no

to

in
her
whining

is
certainly
being
turned
upside
down
it

coming
to
an
end
beautiful
madame
mitaine
who
was
just
then
entering
the
shop
heard
those
last
words
the
end
of
the
world
said
she
gaily
there
were
two
babies
two
fine
big
boys
born
yesterday
and
your
children
auguste
and
eulalie
how
are
they

they
were

there
they
were

there

now
nearly

acquired
a
passion
for
mechanical

holding
trade
in
horror
whilst
eulalie
who
was
a
very
sensible
girl
already
a
little
housewife
at
fifteen
lived
for
the
most
part
with
one
of
her
uncles
a
farmer
of
lignerolles
near
les
combettes
the
children
said
madame
laboque
again
in
a
complaining
voice
ca
rely
on
the
children
are
all
so
ungrateful
declared
dacheux
who
was
indignant
at
finding
no
trace
of
his
own
nature
in
his
daughter
julienne
a
plump
girl
of
a
compassionate
disposition
who
although
she
had
passed
her
fourteenth
birthday
still
played
with
all
the
little
ragamuffins
that
infested
the
rue
de
brias
one
relies
on
children
one
may
be
sure
of
dying
of
misery
and
grief
i
certainly
rely
on
my
Ã©variste

do
resumed
the
wife
close
on
twenty
now
but
we
sha
quarrel
because
he
has
refused
to
learn
his
father
calling
these
young
people
naturally
grow
up
with
ideas
different
from
ours
for
they
are
born
for
times
when
we
shall
no
longer
be
here
all
i
ask
of
my
Ã©variste
is
to
love
me
well
and
that
he
does
she
then
plainly
stated
her
position
to
dacheux
if
she
had
come
to
laboque
shop
at
his
request
it
was
in
order
that
it
might
be
fully
understood
between
them
that
each
tradesman
of
beauclair
ought
to
retain
full
freedom
of
action
she
did
not
as
yet
belong
to
the
association
of
la
crÃªcherie
but
she
relied
upon
joining
it
when
she
might
be
so
pleased
that
is
to
say
when
she
might
feel
convinced
that
she
would
be
acting
in
the
general
interest
as
well
as
in
her
own
evident
that
we
ought
to
be
free
put
in
laboque
by
way
of
conclusion
i
ca
do
otherwise
i
shall
sign
then
madame
laboque
moan
began
once
more
told
you
so
the
world
is
this
is
the
end
of
it
no
the
beautiful
madame
mitaine
again
exclaimed
can
the
world
be
coming
to
an
end
when
our
children
are
just
getting
to
an
age
when
they
may
marry
and
have
children
of
their
own
who
in
their
turn
will
marry
and
have
children
too
the
young
people
are
pushing
the
others
aside
the
world
is
being
renewed
that
what
it
is
the
end
of
world
if
you
like
those
last
words
fell
from
her
so
sharply
and
decisively
that
dacheux
banging
the
door
behind
him
went
off
exasperated
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
a
quiver
of
the
apoplexy
by
which
he
was
threatened
as
madame
mitaine
had
said
it
was
indeed
the
end
of
world
the
end
of
iniquitous
and
rotting
trade
that
trade
which
only
creates
the
wealth
of
a
few
at
the
expense
of
the
greater
number
but
beauclair
was
to
be
upset
by
another
and
greater
blow
hitherto
the
success
of
la
crÃªcherie
had
reacted
only
on
establishments
of
a
similar
nature
and
on
the
petty
traders
those
who
lived
from
day
to
day
on
passing
customers
thus
the
emotion
became
great
indeed
when
one
fine
morning
it
was
learnt
that
mayor
gourier
himself
had
been
won
over
to
the
new
ideas
he
firmly
established
needing
nobody
as
he
declared
in
a
spirit
of
vanity
did
not
intend
to
join
the
association
of
la
crÃªcherie
but
he
founded
another
one
of
a
similar
character
dividing
his
large
of
the
rue
de
brias
into
shares
on
the
basis
of
a
partnership
between
capital
work
and
intelligence
amongst
which
the
profits
were
to
be
apportioned
in
three
parts
this
was
simply
the
establishment
of
a
new
group
what
may
be
called
the
clothing
group
by
the
side
of
that
which
dealt
in
iron
and
steel
and
the
resemblance
between
the
two
became
the
more
pronounced
when
gourier
succeeded
in
syndicating
all
the
branches
of
the
clothing
industry
the
tailors
hatters
hosiers
linendrapers
and
mercers
then
too
yet
another
group
was
spoken
of
one
which
a
big
building
contractor
proposed
to
establish
by
associating
all
the
workers
of
the
building
trade
masons
stonecutters
carpenters
locksmiths
plumbers
tilers
and
painters
and
this
group
would
assuredly
absorb
the
architects
and
artists
as
well
as
the
workers
of
the
furniture
trade
the
cabinetmakers
upholsterers
and
and
in
time
even
the
clockmakers
and
the
jewellers
all
this
was
simply
logical
the
example
of
la
crÃªcherie
had
sown
that
fruitful
idea
of
so
many
associations
forming
natural
groups
which
grew
up
by
themselves
in
an
imitative
spirit
through
a
craving
to
reach
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
life
and
happiness
the
law
of
human
creation
was
working
and
it
would
certainly
work
with
increasing
energy
if
such
were
necessary
for
the
happy
existence
of
the
species
it
already
became
apparent
that
a
general
bond
was
in
process
of
formation
above
these
groups
a
common
link
which
would
some
day
join
them
all
together
in
a
vast
system
of
social
reorganisation
which
would
prove
the
one
code
of
the
future
community
however
the
idea
of
escaping
from
la
crÃªcherie
by
imitating
it
seemed
too
good
a
one
to
have
emanated
from
a
man
of
gourier
intellect
thus
the
general
opinion
was
that
it
must
have
been
suggested
to
the
mayor
by
prefect
chÃ¢telard
who
kept
himself
more
and
more
in
the
background
and
displayed
more
and
more
quiet
indifference
as
beauclair
gradually
transformed
itself
the
guess
was
a
correct
one
for
the
matter
had
been
settled
at
a
little
when
the
mayor
and
the
had
sat
face
to
face
with
only
the
lÃ©onore
beside
them
dear
fellow
had
said
the
with
his
amiable
smile
believe
that
we
are
at
the
end
of
our
tether
everything
is
going
from
worse
to
worse
in
paris
and
the
revolution
is
approaching
to
sweep
away
whatever
remains
of
the
old
rotting
ruinous
social
edifice
here
our
chief
man
boisgelin
is
a
poor
vain
creature
who
will
be
drained
of
his
last
copper
by
little
madame
delaveau
nobody
excepting
her
husband
is
ignorant
of
what
becomes
of
the
money
that
he
still
makes
at
the
abyss
in
his
heroic
struggle
against
bankruptcy
and
you
see
what
a
disaster
there
will
be
presently
so
it
would
really
be
foolish
if
one
did
not
think
of
oneself
if
one
does
not
wish
to
be
dragged
down
with
the
others
at
this
lÃ©onore
showed
some
anxiety
you
yourself
threatened
my
friend
she
asked
oh
no
who
thinks
of
me
no
government
will
trouble
about
my
paltry
self
for
i
am
clever
enough
to
do
as
little
as
possible
in
the
way
of
administrative
duties
and
i
am
always
of
precisely
the
same
opinion
as
my
superiors
whoever
they
may
be
i
shall
die
here
forgotten
and
happy
when
the
last
ministry
collapses
but
it
is
of
you
that
i
am
thinking
my
good
friends
thereupon
he
explained
his
ideas
and
enumerated
all
the
advantages
that
would
accrue
from
anticipating
the
revolution
by
making
a
second
crÃªcherie
of
the
gourier
the
profits
would
not
be
diminished
on
the
contrary
besides
he
was
convinced
he
was
too
intelligent
said
he
to
fail
to
understand
the
truth
the
future
lay
in
that
direction
reorganised
labour
would
end
by
sweeping
the
old
iniquitous
society
away
as
chÃ¢telard
proceeded
it
became
manifest
that
in
that
peaceful
sceptical
functionary
who
deliberately
preserved
an
attitude
of
absolute
inactivity
there
had
sprung
up
a
genuine
anarchist
though
in
public
he
carefully
kept
this
concealed
beneath
a
demeanour
of
diplomatic
reserve
know
my
dear
gourier
he
concluded
with
a
laugh
this
prevent
me
from
declaring
myself
openly
against
you
when
you
have
gone
over
to
the
new
community
i
shall
say
that
you
are
a
traitor
or
that
you
have
lost
your
reason
but
i
shall
embrace
you
whenever
i
come
here
for
you
will
have
played
them
all
a
fine
trick
which
will
bring
you
in
a
deal
of
money
you
see
what
faces
they
pull
all
the
same
gourier
was
quite
scared
by
the
other
suggestions
he
did
not
consent
but
argued
the
matter
at
great
length
the
whole
of
his
past
life
rose
up
in
protest
he
rebelled
at
the
idea
of
becoming
nothing
more
than
the
partner
of
hundreds
of
workers
of
whom
hitherto
he
had
been
absolute
master
beneath
his
heavy
exterior
however
there
was
a
very
shrewd
business
mind
he
fully
understood
that
he
would
risk
nothing
by
the
change
but
on
the
contrary
would
assure
his
establishment
against
all
the
dangers
of
the
future
should
he
adopt
the
advice
of
chÃ¢telard
besides
he
himself
had
been
touched
by
the
passing
gale
that
exaltation
that
passion
for
reform
whose
contagious
fever
at
times
of
revolution
transports
the
very
classes
which
are
about
to
be
despoiled
gourier
indeed
ended
by
believing
that
the
other
idea
was
his
own
even
as
lÃ©onore
by
the
advice
of
her
friend
chÃ¢telard
repeated
to
him
every
morning
and
thus
he
at
last
set
to
work
the
whole
of
beauclair
was
scandalised
deputations
called
upon
judge
gaume
to
beg
him
to
intervene
with
the
mayor
since
the
anxious
to
avoid
compromising
the
government
had
formally
declined
to
meddle
in
this
sorry
affair
which
he
proclaimed
to
be
scandalous
judge
gaume
now
led
a
very
retired
life
seeing
virtually
nobody
since
his
daughter
lucile
compromised
it
seemed
beyond
remedy
by
an
intrigue
with
a
notary
clerk
had
been
obliged
to
seek
a
refuge
with
him
on
being
approached
he
followed
the
same
course
as
chÃ¢telard
and
showed
great
unwillingness
to
go
to
the
mayor
with
representations
which
the
latter
would
doubtless
take
in
very
bad
part
it
was
then
resolved
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
judge
captain
jollivet
his
after
lucile
flight
from
her
home
had
with
growing
wrath
thrown
himself
into
reactionary
courses
he
contributed
such
violent
articles
to
the
de
beauclair
that
lebleu
the
printer
and
proprietor
becoming
anxious
at
the
turn
which
things
were
taking
feeling
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
stronger
and
thus
pass
from
the
abyss
to
the
crÃªcherie
party
one
day
closed
his
door
to
him
the
captain
thus
disarmed
and
reduced
to
idleness
spent
his
time
in
airing
his
futile
rancour
abroad
when
the
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
his
that
he
alone
might
compel
the
judge
to
range
himself
on
their
side
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
captain
had
not
broken
off
all
intercourse
with
his
they
exchanged
salutes
whenever
they
met
accordingly
on
being
entrusted
with
the
delicate
mission
jollivet
presented
himself
at
the
judge
house
in
the
most
ceremonious
fashion
and
two
long
hours
elapsed
before
he
came
out
of
it
again
it
was
then
learnt
that
he
had
only
been
able
to
extract
some
evasive
replies
from
his
but
that
he
had
become
reconciled
with
his
wife
on
the
following
day
she
returned
to
the
conjugal
roof
the
captain
having
forgiven
her
on
her
solemn
promise
that
she
would
never
transgress
again
all
beauclair
was
stupefied
by
this
to
a
very
scandalous
business
and
the
affair
ended
in
a
great
outburst
of
laughter
it
was
the
mazelles
who
ultimately
succeeded
in
drawing
from
gaume
an
expression
of
his
views
and
this
purely
by
chance
without
having
been
entrusted
with
any
mission
whatever
as
a
rule
the
judge
went
out
every
morning
and
made
his
way
to
the
boulevard
de
magnolles
a
long
deserted
avenue
where
he
walked
up
and
down
in
a
gloomy
reverie
with
his
head
bent
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
he
stooped
as
if
beneath
some
final
collapse
as
if
weighed
down
by
the
failure
of
his
whole
life
the
harm
he
had
done
or
the
good
which
he
had
found
he
could
not
do
and
whenever
he
raised
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
gazed
far
away
he
seemed
to
be
looking
and
waiting
for
something
which
did
not
come
which
perchance
he
would
never
see
now
one
morning
on
the
boulevard
de
magnolles
the
mazelles
who
had
risen
early
to
go
to
mass
mustered
sufficient
courage
to
approach
the
judge
in
order
to
ask
him
his
opinion
on
public
affairs
so
greatly
did
they
fear
that
these
would
lead
to
some
disaster
for
themselves
monsieur
le
prÃ©sident
and
what
do
you
think
of
all
that
is
happening
asked
monsieur
mazelle
the
judge
raised
his
head
and
for
a
moment
gazed
into
the
distance
then
reverting
to
his
torturing
reverie
thinking
aloud
as
though
nobody
were
listening
to
him
he
said
say
that
the
hurricane
is
a
long
time
coming
yes
the
hurricane
of
truth
and
justice
which
will
end
by
sweeping
this
abominable
world
away
what
stammered
the
mazelles
thunderstruck
and
imagining
that
they
had
misunderstood
him
want
to
frighten
us
eh
because
you
think
that
we
are
not
that
in
a
measure
true
and
people
tease
us
about
it
but
gaume
had
recovered
his
and
as
soon
as
he
recognised
the
mazelles
who
stood
before
him
scared
with
pale
faces
perspiring
with
anxiety
for
their
money
and
their
idle
lives
his
lips
became
curved
into
an
expression
of
disdainful
irony
do
you
fear
he
resumed
world
will
well
last
another
twenty
years
and
if
you
are
still
alive
then
you
will
console
yourselves
for
the
of
the
revolution
by
witnessing
some
very
interesting
things
it
is
your
daughter
who
ought
to
think
of
the
future
at
this
madame
mazelle
sorrowfully
exclaimed
that
the
very
thing
that
louise
does
not
think
about
ah
not
at
all
she
is
scarcely
thirteen
as
yet
and
when
she
hears
us
talking
of
what
goes
on
as
we
naturally
do
from
morning
till
evening
she
finds
it
very
funny
while
we
despair
she
simply
laughs
whenever
i
say
to
her
you
wretched
girl
why
you
wo
have
a
penny
she
jumps
about
like
a
goat
and
answers
oh
i
do
mind
that
no
not
a
bit
i
shall
be
all
the
merrier
but
all
the
same
she
a
very
dear
girl
although
she
does
so
little
of
what
we
desire
said
gaume
dreams
of
mapping
out
her
life
for
herself
there
girls
like
that
mazelle
remained
perplexed
for
he
feared
that
the
judge
was
again
poking
fun
at
him
the
idea
that
he
had
made
a
fortune
in
ten
years
that
he
had
since
been
leading
the
delightful
life
of
sloth
of
which
he
had
dreamt
already
in
his
youth
and
that
his
felicity
might
now
come
to
an
end
that
he
might
perhaps
be
compelled
to
work
again
if
work
should
become
the
general
rule
filled
him
with
ceaseless
intolerable
anguish
which
was
like
a
first
punishment
for
his
sins
the
rentes
monsieur
le
prÃ©sident
what
would
become
of
them
in
your
opinion
if
all
those
anarchists
should
succeed
in
turning
the
world
as
you
may
remember
that
monsieur
luc
who
is
behaving
so
badly
used
to
make
fun
of
us
saying
that
the
rentes
would
be
suppressed
in
that
case
they
may
as
well
cut
our
throats
in
peace
i
tell
you
gaume
repeated
with
quiet
irony
new
social
fabric
will
feed
you
if
you
wo
work
then
the
mazelles
went
off
to
church
where
they
now
burnt
tapers
to
the
virgin
in
the
hope
of
inducing
her
to
cure
madame
mazelle
for
doctor
novarre
had
one
day
been
brute
enough
to
tell
the
old
lady
that
she
was
not
ill
at
all
not
ill
indeed
when
she
had
been
nursing
her
illness
so
lovingly
for
so
many
years
that
illness
which
was
her
very
life
to
such
a
point
had
she
made
it
her
occupation
her
joy
her
if
the
doctor
forsook
her
it
must
be
that
he
deemed
her
incurable
at
which
thought
full
of
terror
she
had
addressed
herself
to
religion
in
which
she
now
found
great
relief
there
was
another
promenader
on
the
boulevard
de
magnolles
that
desert
whose
quietude
was
so
seldom
disturbed
by
any
this
was
abbÃ©
marle
who
came
thither
to
read
his
breviary
but
he
often
let
the
hand
which
held
the
book
fall
beside
him
whilst
still
slowly
walking
on
absorbed
like
the
judge
in
a
gloomy
reverie
since
the
last
events
those
incidents
of
the
evolution
which
was
bearing
the
town
towards
a
new
destiny
his
church
had
become
still
emptier
by
way
of
congregation
there
only
remained
some
very
old
women
of
the
people
obstinate
creatures
and
a
few
who
supported
religion
because
they
deemed
it
to
be
the
last
rampart
of
fine
society
which
was
now
crumbling
to
pieces
when
the
last
of
the
faithful
should
desert
the
catholic
churches
leaving
them
to
brambles
and
nettles
like
the
ruins
of
a
dead
social
system
another
civilisation
would
begin
and
with
this
threat
above
his
head
the
presence
of
the
few
and
old
women
of
the
people
in
no
wise
consoled
abbÃ©
marle
who
felt
that
the
void
around
him
was
ever
increasing
lÃ©onore
the
mayor
wife
looked
very
decorative
no
doubt
at
high
mass
on
sundays
and
opened
her
purse
widely
to
contribute
to
the
expenses
of
public
worship
but
he
knew
her
indignity
her
life
of
sin
which
the
whole
town
accepted
and
over
which
he
himself
had
been
compelled
to
cast
the
cloak
of
his
holy
office
though
he
regarded
that
life
as
one
leading
to
eternal
perdition
for
which
he
himself
would
be
accounted
responsible
and
still
less
did
the
support
of
the
mazelles
content
him
they
were
so
childish
and
so
basely
egotistical
if
they
came
to
him
it
was
solely
in
the
hope
of
extracting
some
personal
felicity
from
heaven
even
as
they
had
invested
their
money
so
did
they
invest
their
prayers
that
is
with
the
object
of
deriving
rentes
from
them
on
high
and
one
and
all
were
the
same
in
that
dying
society
all
lacked
the
true
faith
which
in
the
first
centuries
had
given
christianity
its
force
all
lacked
the
spirit
of
renunciation
and
absolute
obedience
a
spirit
which
was
more
than
ever
necessary
nowadays
if
the
power
of
the
church
was
to
be
maintained
thus
the
priest
no
longer
hid
it
from
himself
the
days
were
numbered
and
if
god
in
his
mercy
did
not
soon
call
him
hence
he
would
perhaps
behold
the
awful
catastrophe
the
steeple
of
his
church
falling
bursting
through
the
roof
of
the
nave
and
crushing
the
altar
of
the
divinity
it
was
in
such
sombre
reveries
that
he
indulged
for
hours
whilst
he
walked
about
the
boulevard
de
magnolles
he
kept
them
well
within
him
and
affected
to
remain
brave
and
haughty
full
of
disdain
for
passing
events
under
the
pretext
that
the
church
was
the
mistress
of
eternity
but
whenever
he
met
hermeline
the
schoolmaster
who
was
in
a
continuous
rage
over
the
successes
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
ready
to
go
over
to
the
reactionists
in
order
to
save
the
republic
he
no
longer
discussed
things
with
his
former
bitterness
but
declared
that
he
placed
his
trust
in
the
divinity
who
must
certainly
be
allowing
these
anarchist
saturnalia
with
the
object
of
ultimately
striking
down
the
enemies
of
religion
and
thus
making
it
triumphant
doctor
novarre
jestingly
said
that
the
abbÃ©
abandoned
sodom
on
the
eve
of
the
rain
of
fire
by
sodom
he
meant
beauclair
that
beauclair
devoured
by
egotism
the
town
condemned
to
be
destroyed
and
of
which
the
earth
must
be
purified
if
on
its
site
one
desired
to
see
the
city
of
health
and
delight
justice
and
peace
arise
every
symptom
pointed
to
the
approach
of
the
final
rending
the
was
at
its
last
gasp
the
distracted
was
passing
over
to
the
revolutionists
the
despairing
desire
to
save
something
of
one
interests
was
bringing
all
the
living
strength
of
the
country
over
to
the
conquerors
and
as
for
what
remained
the
scattered
unusable
remnants
of
the
old
system
they
would
be
swept
away
by
the
wind
the
radiant
beauclair
of
was
already
emerging
from
the
ruins
and
when
abbÃ©
marle
as
he
strolled
under
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
de
magnolles
let
his
breviary
fall
and
slackening
his
pace
his
eyes
it
was
assuredly
a
vision
of
that
coming
city
that
arose
before
him
and
filled
him
with
such
intense
bitterness
at
times
judge
gaume
and
abbÃ©
marle
met
in
the
course
of
those
silent
solitary
walks
at
first
they
did
not
see
one
another
but
walked
on
with
lowered
heads
so
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
what
they
pictured
that
nothing
of
their
surroundings
remained
visible
to
them
each
on
his
own
side
chewed
the
cud
of
his
own
despair
the
one
his
regret
for
the
world
which
was
disappearing
the
other
his
appeal
to
the
world
which
was
now
rising
from
the
ground
exhausted
religion
was
unwilling
to
die
justice
awaiting
birth
was
in
despair
that
its
advent
should
be
so
long
delayed
however
the
two
men
at
last
raised
their
heads
and
recognised
one
another
then
it
became
necessary
for
them
to
exchange
a
few
words
is
very
gloomy
weather
monsieur
le
prÃ©sident
we
shall
have
some
rain
the
priest
would
say
fear
so
monsieur
replied
the
judge
is
quite
cold
for
the
month
of
june
how
can
it
be
otherwise
the
seasons
are
all
out
of
order
now
there
is
no
equilibrium
left
yet
life
goes
on
the
good
sun
will
perhaps
set
everything
right
again
then
each
resumed
his
solitary
perambulations
sank
into
his
reflections
carrying
hither
and
thither
the
eternal
battle
between
the
past
and
the
future
it
was
however
especially
at
the
abyss
that
one
felt
the
effects
of
the
evolution
of
beauclair
which
the
reorganisation
of
labour
was
gradually
transforming
at
each
fresh
success
achieved
by
la
crÃªcherie
delaveau
had
to
display
more
activity
intelligence
and
courage
and
naturally
everything
which
contributed
to
the
prosperity
of
the
rival
works
to
him
brought
disaster
thus
the
discovery
of
excellent
lodes
of
ore
in
the
mine
dealt
him
a
terrible
blow
since
it
so
greatly
reduced
the
price
of
raw
material
he
could
no
longer
continue
struggling
so
far
as
commercial
iron
and
steel
were
concerned
and
the
manufacture
of
guns
and
projectiles
likewise
suffered
there
had
been
a
marked
falling
off
in
orders
since
the
money
of
france
had
been
more
particularly
spent
on
manufactures
that
symbolised
peace
and
social
solidarity
such
as
railways
bridges
structures
of
all
kinds
in
which
iron
and
steel
triumphed
the
worst
was
that
the
orders
for
ordnance
which
went
to
only
a
few
establishments
no
longer
sufficed
to
enable
all
of
them
to
pay
their
way
and
if
the
market
was
to
be
cleared
one
of
them
at
least
must
be
killed
the
least
firmly
established
of
all
being
at
that
moment
the
abyss
it
was
the
latter
which
the
other
competing
foundries
savagely
resolved
to
destroy
the
difficulties
of
the
abyss
were
becoming
the
greater
since
its
workmen
no
longer
remained
faithful
to
it
ragu
attempt
to
kill
luc
had
thrown
the
comrades
that
he
left
behind
him
into
confusion
and
when
bourron
converted
brought
round
to
reason
had
returned
to
la
crÃªcherie
followed
by
fauchard
a
general
movement
set
in
most
of
the
other
men
asking
themselves
why
they
should
not
follow
example
since
so
many
advantages
awaited
them
yonder
the
success
of
luc
experiment
was
now
evident
the
men
employed
at
la
crÃªcherie
earned
twice
as
much
as
at
the
abyss
and
yet
they
only
worked
eight
hours
and
besides
there
were
other
attractions
the
pleasant
little
houses
the
schools
where
the
children
learned
things
so
well
and
so
merrily
the
which
was
ever
and
the
general
stores
whose
prices
were
fully
a
third
lower
than
those
of
other
places
the
whole
tending
to
increase
of
health
and
increase
of
comfort
nothing
is
of
any
avail
against
figures
the
men
of
the
abyss
wishing
to
earn
as
much
as
those
of
la
crÃªcherie
demanded
a
rise
in
wages
as
it
was
impossible
to
grant
this
demand
many
of
them
naturally
went
off
and
finally
delaveau
was
paralysed
by
the
lack
of
a
reserve
fund
he
did
not
yet
confess
himself
conquered
he
would
have
held
out
for
a
long
time
and
would
in
his
own
opinion
have
ended
by
triumphing
if
he
had
possessed
a
few
hundred
thousand
francs
to
help
him
to
pass
through
this
crisis
which
he
obstinately
believed
to
be
a
temporary
one
only
how
was
he
to
continue
fighting
how
was
he
to
face
when
money
failed
him
moreover
the
money
which
he
had
already
borrowed
was
proving
a
crushing
charge
on
the
business
yet
he
struggled
on
heroically
ever
erect
devoting
all
his
intelligence
his
very
life
to
his
work
in
the
hope
that
he
might
still
save
the
crumbling
past
which
he
supported
and
that
he
might
wring
from
the
capital
entrusted
to
him
the
revenue
that
he
had
promised
delaveau
worst
sufferings
indeed
arose
from
the
fact
that
he
could
no
longer
hand
boisgelin
the
profits
which
he
had
covenanted
to
extract
from
the
business
and
his
defeat
became
materialised
in
the
most
cruel
fashion
on
the
days
when
he
was
compelled
to
refuse
his
cousin
money
although
on
the
last
occasion
when
accounts
had
been
balanced
the
position
had
proved
to
be
disastrous
boisgelin
would
in
no
respect
curtail
his
expenditure
at
la
guerdache
in
this
matter
he
was
inflamed
by
fernande
who
treated
her
husband
like
an
ox
at
the
plough
one
that
needed
to
be
goaded
till
it
bled
in
order
to
discharge
its
work
properly
never
had
the
young
woman
shown
herself
more
ardent
more
insatiable
than
now
she
was
consumed
by
a
passion
for
excesses
there
was
something
wild
in
her
glance
something
that
suggested
a
desire
for
the
impossible
her
acquaintances
felt
anxious
about
her
and
chÃ¢telard
confidentially
told
mayor
gourier
that
the
little
woman
would
assuredly
end
by
perpetrating
some
great
piece
of
folly
from
which
all
of
them
would
suffer
hitherto
she
had
contented
herself
with
changing
her
home
into
a
hell
by
urging
boisgelin
upon
her
husband
pressing
him
with
continual
demands
for
money
whereby
delaveau
was
thrown
into
such
a
state
of
exasperation
that
he
even
continued
growling
at
night
when
resting
his
head
on
the
conjugal
pillow
fernande
by
her
remarks
maliciously
kept
his
wound
open
nevertheless
he
still
adored
her
set
her
upon
one
side
like
an
innocent
immaculate
being
whom
it
was
impossible
to
suspect
november
came
with
intense
early
cold
the
payments
which
fell
due
that
month
were
so
large
that
delaveau
fancied
he
could
feel
the
very
ground
he
walked
upon
trembling
beneath
him
he
had
not
the
necessary
amount
of
money
in
the
safe
on
the
evening
before
the
day
on
which
the
payments
had
to
be
made
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
private
room
to
reflect
and
write
some
letters
whilst
fernande
went
to
dine
at
la
guerdache
whither
she
had
been
invited
though
she
was
unaware
of
it
he
himself
had
gone
thither
in
the
morning
and
had
had
a
decisive
conversation
with
boisgelin
in
which
after
plainly
stating
the
terrible
position
he
had
at
last
prevailed
on
him
to
reduce
his
expenditure
he
meant
to
limit
him
to
a
proper
allowance
for
several
years
and
had
even
advised
him
to
sell
la
guerdache
and
now
alone
in
his
private
room
delaveau
walked
about
slowly
every
now
and
then
mechanically
stirring
the
large
coke
fire
which
was
burning
in
a
kind
of
stove
before
the
the
only
possible
means
of
salvation
was
to
secure
time
he
must
write
to
the
creditors
who
could
not
possibly
desire
to
see
the
works
closed
however
he
did
not
hurry
about
it
he
would
write
his
letters
after
dinner
meantime
he
continued
thinking
whilst
going
from
one
window
to
the
other
ever
returning
to
the
one
whence
he
could
see
the
lands
of
la
crÃªcherie
even
to
the
distant
park
and
the
pavilion
where
luc
resided
the
cold
frosty
atmosphere
was
very
clear
and
the
sun
was
setting
in
a
sky
as
pure
as
crystal
a
pale
golden
glow
bringing
the
growing
town
into
delicate
relief
against
a
purple
background
never
had
delaveau
seen
it
so
plainly
it
seemed
to
palpitate
with
life
he
could
have
counted
the
light
slender
branches
of
the
trees
and
he
was
able
to
distinguish
the
smallest
details
of
the
houses
down
to
the
decorations
of
faÃ¯ence
which
rendered
them
so
gay
there
came
a
moment
when
under
the
oblique
rays
of
the
sun
all
the
windows
began
to
flame
and
sparkle
like
hundreds
of
bonfires
it
was
like
a
triumph
a
glory
and
delaveau
remained
there
drawing
the
cretonne
curtains
aside
and
gazing
at
that
triumph
with
his
face
close
to
the
even
as
luc
over
yonder
at
the
other
end
of
the
lands
of
la
crÃªcherie
occasionally
watched
his
town
marching
on
spreading
out
and
threatening
the
abyss
with
invasion
so
delaveau
on
his
side
often
came
to
gaze
at
it
and
found
it
ever
growing
threatening
him
with
conquest
how
many
times
of
recent
years
had
he
not
lingered
at
that
window
and
on
each
occasion
he
had
seen
the
rising
tide
of
houses
growing
larger
and
drawing
nearer
to
the
abyss
it
had
started
from
a
remote
point
of
a
great
stretch
of
uncultivated
deserted
land
one
house
had
appeared
there
like
a
little
wave
then
another
and
another
and
those
waves
had
covered
the
whole
space
before
them
and
now
they
were
only
a
few
hundred
yards
away
and
were
rolling
in
a
sea
of
incalculable
power
ready
to
carry
off
everything
which
might
oppose
them
would
witness
an
irresistible
invasion
all
the
past
would
be
swept
away
the
abyss
and
beauclair
too
would
be
replaced
by
the
young
and
triumphant
city
at
one
moment
when
a
very
severe
crisis
had
fallen
on
la
crÃªcherie
delaveau
had
hoped
that
the
advance
would
stop
but
before
long
the
new
town
had
resumed
its
march
so
impulsively
that
the
old
walls
of
the
abyss
were
now
already
shaking
yet
he
would
not
despair
he
tried
to
stiffen
himself
against
the
evidence
of
facts
and
flattered
himself
that
he
would
find
the
necessary
dyke
and
rampart
in
his
own
energy
that
particular
evening
however
he
was
enervated
by
anxiety
and
began
to
feel
some
covert
regrets
had
he
not
formerly
made
a
mistake
in
letting
bonnaire
take
himself
off
he
remembered
certain
prophetic
words
spoken
by
that
strong
yet
simple
man
at
the
time
of
the
great
strike
and
it
was
on
the
morrow
of
that
strike
that
bonnaire
like
a
good
worker
had
helped
to
found
la
crÃªcherie
since
then
the
abyss
had
scarcely
ever
ceased
to
decline
ragu
had
besmirched
it
with
attempted
murder
bourron
fauchard
and
others
were
quitting
it
as
they
might
have
quitted
an
accursed
spot
and
afar
off
the
new
town
was
still
flaming
in
the
sunlight
at
the
sight
of
it
sudden
anger
seized
upon
delaveau
anger
whose
violence
restored
him
to
himself
to
the
beliefs
of
his
whole
life
no
no
he
had
been
right
the
truth
was
in
the
past
nothing
could
be
extracted
from
men
unless
one
bent
them
beneath
the
authority
of
dogma
the
remained
the
true
law
of
labour
and
beyond
its
pale
there
could
be
naught
save
madness
and
catastrophe
then
delaveau
intent
on
seeing
nothing
more
drew
the
large
cretonne
curtains
together
lighted
his
little
electric
lamp
and
again
began
to
reflect
as
he
strolled
about
his
room
which
the
glowing
stove
rendered
extremely
warm
at
last
after
dinner
delaveau
sat
down
at
his
writing
table
to
attend
to
his
letters
in
accordance
with
the
plans
which
he
had
been
maturing
for
hours
plans
whereby
he
hoped
to
save
the
business
midnight
struck
and
he
still
sat
there
completing
that
worrying
and
difficult
correspondence
and
doubts
had
now
come
to
him
he
was
again
possessed
by
fear
did
salvation
really
lie
in
the
direction
he
was
taking
what
would
he
be
able
to
do
even
if
the
delays
he
asked
for
should
be
granted
exhausted
by
the
superhuman
effort
he
was
making
to
save
the
abyss
he
at
last
bowed
his
head
and
let
it
rest
upon
his
hands
and
thus
he
remained
deep
in
anguish
but
at
that
same
moment
the
rattle
of
a
carriage
was
heard
and
words
rang
out
fernande
had
just
returned
from
the
dinner
at
la
guerdache
and
was
sending
the
servants
to
bed
when
she
entered
her
husband
private
room
it
was
with
hasty
gestures
and
excited
speech
like
a
woman
who
is
beside
herself
one
who
has
been
restraining
and
nursing
her
anger
for
hours
heavens
how
hot
it
is
here
how
can
one
live
with
such
a
fire
then
sinking
back
in
an
armchair
she
unclasped
and
threw
off
the
magnificent
furs
which
covered
her
shoulders
and
appeared
in
all
her
marvellous
beauty
gowned
in
silk
and
white
lace
with
arms
and
bosom
bare
her
husband
expressed
no
surprise
at
her
luxurious
ways
he
did
not
even
notice
them
he
loved
her
solely
for
herself
her
beauty
and
passion
always
rendered
him
obedient
to
her
whims
deprived
him
of
both
foresight
and
strength
never
too
had
a
more
intoxicating
charm
emanated
from
her
person
than
at
this
period
that
evening
however
when
delaveau
with
his
head
still
buzzing
looked
up
at
her
he
became
anxious
is
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
he
asked
it
was
evident
that
she
was
greatly
upset
her
large
dark
blue
eyes
which
as
a
rule
had
such
a
caressing
expression
now
glowed
with
a
sombre
fire
her
little
mouth
which
usually
smiled
in
such
a
tenderly
deceitful
way
opened
showing
her
strong
teeth
whose
lustre
nothing
could
tarnish
and
which
seemed
ready
to
bite
and
the
whole
of
her
face
which
displayed
such
a
charming
oval
under
her
black
hair
was
swollen
as
by
a
craving
for
violence
is
the
matter
with
me
she
ended
by
saying
whilst
she
still
quivered
silence
fell
again
and
amidst
the
lifeless
quietude
of
that
winter
night
one
heard
the
growling
of
the
busy
abyss
the
blows
of
whose
hammers
continuously
shook
the
house
as
a
rule
the
delaveaus
remained
unconscious
of
it
but
that
night
in
spite
of
the
falling
off
in
business
the
huge
had
been
set
to
work
to
forge
the
tube
of
a
great
gun
in
all
haste
and
the
ground
quaked
the
vibrations
of
each
blow
seemed
to
resound
in
that
very
room
coming
thither
along
the
light
wooden
gallery
which
connected
it
with
the
works
there
is
something
the
matter
with
you
delaveau
resumed
wo
you
tell
me
what
it
is
a
gesture
of
wrathful
impatience
escaped
fernande
who
replied
us
go
to
bed
that
will
be
better
nevertheless
she
did
not
stir
with
feverish
hands
she
continued
twisting
her
fan
whilst
her
breath
came
short
and
quick
and
her
bosom
heaved
at
last
she
blurted
out
what
was
stifling
her
you
went
to
la
guerdache
this
morning
i
went
there
answered
delaveau
what
boisgelin
has
just
told
me
is
true
then
the
works
are
in
danger
of
bankruptcy
we
are
on
the
eve
of
ruin
such
ruin
indeed
that
i
shall
have
to
content
myself
with
woollen
gowns
and
dry
bread
had
to
tell
him
the
truth
fernande
was
trembling
and
had
to
restrain
herself
from
bursting
forth
into
reproaches
and
insults
at
once
it
was
all
over
her
life
of
enjoyment
was
threatened
nay
ended
no
more
festivities
neither
dinners
nor
balls
nor
hunts
would
be
given
at
la
guerdache
its
doors
would
be
closed
to
her
for
had
not
boisgelin
confessed
that
he
would
perhaps
be
compelled
to
sell
the
property
and
her
dream
of
returning
to
paris
with
millions
to
squander
was
ended
also
all
that
she
had
imagined
she
held
within
her
grasp
fortune
luxury
and
pleasure
had
crumbled
to
pieces
nought
but
ruin
encompassed
her
and
that
wretched
boisgelin
had
increased
her
exasperation
by
his
supineness
his
cowardice
in
bending
his
head
beneath
the
disaster
never
tell
me
anything
about
our
affairs
she
continued
bitterly
treated
as
if
i
were
a
fool
that
news
fell
on
me
as
if
the
very
ceilings
were
coming
down
but
if
things
are
like
that
what
are
we
going
to
do
just
tell
me
shall
work
delaveau
simply
answered
is
no
other
means
of
salvation
possible
but
she
did
not
hear
his
last
words
she
had
ceased
to
listen
you
for
a
moment
imagine
said
she
i
should
consent
to
remain
with
nothing
to
wear
to
trudge
about
in
boots
and
begin
afresh
that
wretched
life
which
i
remember
like
a
nightmare
ah
no
i
not
like
you
others
i
wo
have
it
i
wo
you
will
have
to
arrange
something
you
and
boisgelin
between
you
for
i
wo
be
poor
again
then
she
went
on
pouring
forth
all
that
was
distracting
her
mind
there
was
her
wretched
youth
when
living
with
her
mother
the
music
teacher
she
had
failed
to
capture
the
prize
which
her
great
beauty
had
seemed
to
promise
her
for
after
seduction
she
had
been
abandoned
and
following
upon
that
odious
adventure
the
memory
of
which
she
hid
deep
within
her
had
come
her
marriage
all
calculation
and
diplomacy
the
acceptance
of
that
ugly
insignificant
delaveau
whom
she
had
taken
because
she
felt
the
need
of
some
support
a
husband
whom
she
might
put
to
use
and
then
had
come
a
lucky
stroke
the
acquisition
of
the
abyss
the
success
of
her
plans
her
husband
procuring
victory
for
her
boisgelin
conquered
la
guerdache
and
every
luxury
and
enjoyment
at
her
disposal
twelve
years
had
followed
replete
with
all
the
pleasures
that
she
had
tasted
there
like
the
enjoyer
the
perverter
she
was
satisfying
her
endless
appetites
and
the
dark
rancour
amassed
within
her
since
childhood
happy
in
lying
betraying
bringing
ruin
and
disorder
with
her
and
in
particular
exulting
over
the
tears
which
she
drew
from
suzanne
eyes
but
now
to
think
that
this
was
not
to
last
that
she
was
destined
to
relapse
vanquished
into
the
poverty
of
her
former
days
must
arrange
something
arrange
something
she
repeated
wo
go
bare
i
wo
dispense
with
anything
to
which
i
have
been
accustomed
delaveau
growing
impatient
shrugged
his
sturdy
shoulders
he
was
still
resting
his
massive
bulldog
head
with
projecting
jaws
upon
his
two
fists
whilst
looking
at
her
with
his
big
dark
eyes
his
face
reddened
the
while
by
the
great
heat
of
the
fire
were
right
my
dear
said
he
let
us
talk
of
these
matters
for
you
seem
to
me
to
be
scarcely
reasonable
i
am
very
fond
of
you
as
you
know
and
am
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
spare
you
suffering
but
i
hope
that
you
will
resign
yourself
to
doing
as
i
myself
intend
to
do
i
mean
to
fight
as
long
as
there
is
breath
in
my
body
if
necessary
i
shall
get
up
at
five
in
the
morning
live
on
a
crust
of
bread
give
my
whole
day
to
work
and
no
doubt
i
shall
go
to
bed
at
night
feeling
quite
content
besides
what
if
you
do
have
to
wear
more
simple
gowns
and
have
to
go
out
on
foot
only
the
other
evening
you
yourself
were
telling
me
how
all
these
pleasures
ever
the
same
wearied
and
disgusted
you
this
was
true
fernande
blue
caressing
eyes
darkened
till
they
almost
became
black
as
she
thought
of
it
for
some
time
past
she
had
failed
to
satisfy
her
passion
for
enjoyment
though
she
was
unwilling
to
give
up
her
present
life
it
palled
upon
her
she
was
full
of
rancour
against
both
her
husband
and
her
lover
who
no
longer
amused
her
and
she
often
wondered
wrathfully
whether
she
would
ever
feel
amused
again
thus
it
was
with
insulting
contempt
that
she
had
greeted
the
lamentations
of
boisgelin
when
the
latter
had
told
her
of
his
despair
at
being
compelled
to
cut
down
his
expenses
and
this
also
was
why
she
had
returned
home
in
such
a
passion
eager
to
bite
and
to
destroy
yes
she
stammered
pleasures
which
are
always
the
same
ah
it
is
you
who
ever
give
me
any
new
ones
in
the
works
the
heavy
blows
of
the
steam
hammer
still
resounded
making
the
ground
tremble
long
had
that
hammer
forged
delight
for
her
by
wringing
from
steel
the
wealth
she
coveted
whilst
the
grimy
flock
of
toilers
gave
their
lives
in
order
that
her
own
might
be
one
of
full
and
free
enjoyment
for
a
moment
she
listened
to
the
dolorous
commotion
of
labour
sounding
amidst
the
heavy
silence
then
with
her
savage
hatred
increasing
she
turned
upon
her
husband
is
all
your
fault
if
this
has
happened
she
cried
told
boisgelin
so
if
you
had
begun
by
strangling
that
wretched
luc
froment
we
should
not
now
be
on
the
eve
of
ruin
but
you
have
never
known
how
to
conduct
business
at
this
delaveau
abruptly
rose
from
his
chair
and
resisting
the
anger
which
was
gaining
on
him
retorted
go
to
bed
if
we
went
on
discussing
you
would
end
by
making
me
say
things
which
i
should
regret
afterwards
but
she
did
not
stir
she
continued
speaking
so
bitterly
so
aggressively
accusing
her
husband
of
having
wrecked
her
life
that
he
on
his
side
waxing
brutal
at
last
exclaimed
when
i
married
you
my
dear
you
had
a
halfpenny
it
was
i
who
had
to
buy
you
some
clothes
you
were
on
the
point
of
falling
to
the
streets
and
where
would
you
have
been
now
at
this
thrusting
her
face
and
bosom
forward
she
answered
with
a
murderous
glance
do
you
imagine
that
beautiful
as
i
was
a
prince
daughter
i
should
have
accepted
such
a
man
as
you
ugly
common
and
without
position
if
i
had
only
had
bread
just
look
at
yourself
my
friend
i
took
you
because
you
promised
to
win
a
fortune
a
royal
position
for
me
and
if
i
tell
you
this
it
is
because
you
have
kept
none
of
your
engagements
delaveau
was
now
standing
before
her
letting
her
talk
on
whilst
clenching
his
fists
and
striving
to
retain
his
hear
she
repeated
with
furious
obstinacy
of
your
engagements
none
no
more
with
boisgelin
than
with
me
for
certainly
you
who
have
ruined
the
poor
fellow
you
prevailed
on
him
to
trust
his
money
to
you
you
promised
him
a
fabulous
income
and
now
he
wo
oven
have
enough
money
left
him
to
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
when
a
man
is
capable
of
managing
a
large
business
my
friend
he
remains
a
petty
clerk
and
lives
in
a
hovel
with
a
wife
ugly
enough
and
stupid
enough
to
wash
a
pack
of
children
and
mend
their
socks
yes
bankruptcy
has
come
and
it
is
your
fault
you
hear
me
your
fault
yours
yours
alone
delaveau
was
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
those
savage
words
tortured
him
as
if
a
knife
had
been
turned
round
and
round
in
his
heart
and
conscience
to
think
that
he
had
loved
that
woman
so
well
and
to
hear
her
speak
of
their
marriage
as
a
base
bargain
in
which
on
her
side
there
had
only
been
so
much
necessity
and
calculation
for
nearly
fifteen
years
he
had
been
striving
so
loyally
and
so
heroically
to
keep
the
promise
he
had
made
his
cousin
and
yet
she
accused
him
of
incapacity
and
lack
of
business
knowledge
he
caught
hold
of
her
bare
arms
with
both
hands
and
shook
her
saying
in
a
low
tone
as
if
he
feared
that
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
might
unhinge
him
quiet
you
unhappy
woman
do
not
madden
me
but
she
in
her
turn
arose
and
freed
herself
stammering
with
anger
and
pain
at
the
sight
of
the
red
circles
which
his
rough
grasp
had
left
round
her
delicate
white
arms
beat
me
now
you
blackguard
you
brute
she
cried
you
beat
me
you
beat
me
and
again
she
thrust
forward
her
beautiful
face
now
convulsed
by
wrath
and
spat
out
all
her
contempt
full
in
that
man
countenance
which
she
longed
to
lacerate
with
her
nails
never
had
she
hated
him
so
much
never
had
the
sight
of
his
massive
bulldog
figure
irritated
her
to
such
a
degree
as
now
all
the
rancour
amassed
within
her
arose
once
more
urged
her
on
to
some
irreparable
insult
which
should
end
everything
with
instinctive
cruelty
she
sought
a
means
of
inflicting
some
poisonous
wound
something
that
should
make
him
howl
and
suffer
are
only
a
brute
she
cried
are
not
capable
of
directing
a
gang
of
ten
men
at
this
singular
insult
which
seemed
to
him
stupid
and
childish
delaveau
burst
into
convulsive
laughter
and
this
laughter
exasperated
fernande
to
such
a
point
that
she
became
half
delirious
what
could
she
say
to
him
that
would
prove
a
mortal
blow
and
bring
his
laughter
to
an
end
it
was
i
who
made
you
what
you
are
she
exclaimed
it
had
not
been
for
me
you
would
not
have
remained
director
of
the
abyss
a
single
year
at
this
he
laughed
all
the
louder
are
mad
my
dear
you
say
such
stupid
things
that
they
do
affect
me
say
foolish
things
do
i
so
it
was
not
thanks
to
me
that
you
kept
your
place
confession
had
suddenly
risen
to
her
throat
ah
to
shout
it
full
in
his
dog
face
to
shout
that
she
had
never
loved
him
and
that
she
was
another
mistress
that
was
the
which
would
make
his
laughter
cease
and
how
it
would
relieve
her
what
terrible
and
ferocious
and
voluptuous
enjoyment
she
would
taste
in
that
collapse
of
her
life
which
was
already
crumbling
to
pieces
she
flung
herself
into
the
pit
with
a
cry
of
horrible
delight
things
i
say
are
not
stupid
for
i
been
boisgelin
mistress
for
twelve
years
past
delaveau
did
not
immediately
understand
her
those
horrible
words
striking
him
full
in
the
face
had
almost
stunned
him
is
that
you
say
say
that
i
been
boisgelin
mistress
for
twelve
years
past
and
since
there
nothing
left
since
all
is
falling
to
pieces
well
there
that
the
end
of
it
in
his
turn
half
delirious
stammering
with
his
teeth
clenched
delaveau
rushed
upon
her
caught
hold
of
her
arms
shook
her
and
threw
her
into
the
he
would
have
liked
to
pound
and
annihilate
all
that
provoking
nudity
which
she
displayed
her
bare
shoulders
and
bare
bosom
to
prevent
her
from
ever
insulting
and
torturing
him
again
the
veil
was
at
last
torn
away
and
he
saw
and
divined
things
clearly
she
had
never
loved
him
her
life
beside
him
had
never
been
aught
but
hypocrisy
ruse
falsehood
and
betrayal
from
that
beautiful
polished
charming
woman
whom
he
had
adored
there
suddenly
emerged
a
all
sombre
fury
and
brutal
instinct
many
things
of
the
cause
of
which
he
had
been
ignorant
had
sprung
from
her
she
was
the
perverter
the
poisoner
who
had
slowly
corrupted
all
around
her
hers
was
the
flesh
of
cruelty
and
treachery
whose
enjoyment
had
been
made
up
of
the
tears
and
blood
of
others
but
whilst
he
was
still
struggling
with
his
stupefaction
she
insulted
him
again
your
fists
eh
you
brute
oh
go
on
hit
hit
like
your
workmen
do
when
they
are
drunk
then
amidst
the
frightful
silence
which
fell
between
them
delaveau
heard
the
rhythmic
blows
of
the
the
commotion
of
labour
which
without
a
pause
accompanied
both
his
days
and
his
nights
the
sound
came
to
him
like
a
voice
whose
clear
language
acquainted
him
with
the
whole
of
the
horrible
adventure
was
it
not
fernande
with
her
little
teeth
of
unchangeable
lustre
who
had
devoured
all
the
wealth
which
yonder
hammer
had
forged
that
burning
thought
possessed
his
brain
she
was
the
devourer
the
one
cause
of
the
disaster
of
the
squandering
of
millions
of
the
inevitable
approaching
bankruptcy
whilst
he
had
been
heroically
striving
to
keep
his
promises
working
eighteen
hours
a
day
endeavouring
to
save
the
old
and
crumbling
world
it
was
she
who
had
gnawed
at
the
edifice
and
rotted
it
she
had
lived
there
beside
him
looking
so
quiet
with
her
soft
smiling
face
and
yet
she
herself
was
the
poison
the
destructive
agent
who
had
paralysed
his
efforts
and
annihilated
his
work
yes
ruin
had
ever
been
present
beside
him
at
his
table
in
his
bed
and
he
had
not
seen
it
she
had
shaken
everything
with
her
little
agile
hands
and
pulverised
everything
with
her
little
white
teeth
he
remembered
nights
when
she
had
returned
from
la
guerdache
intoxicated
by
the
caresses
of
her
lover
by
the
wine
she
had
drunk
by
the
waltzes
she
had
danced
by
the
money
which
she
had
flung
around
her
and
when
she
had
slept
off
that
intoxication
lying
by
his
side
whilst
he
with
his
eyes
wide
open
peering
into
the
darkness
tortured
his
brain
in
striving
to
devise
some
means
for
saving
the
abyss
and
did
not
even
stir
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
slumber
and
this
which
seemed
to
him
the
supreme
horror
of
all
inspired
him
with
mad
fury
and
made
him
shout
shall
die
she
sat
up
in
the
chair
her
elbows
resting
on
its
arms
her
bare
bosom
and
her
charming
face
again
thrust
forward
under
her
black
casque
of
splendid
hair
as
for
that
i
agreeable
i
had
enough
of
you
and
the
others
and
myself
and
life
as
well
i
rather
die
than
live
in
wretchedness
shall
die
you
shall
die
he
howled
growing
wilder
and
wilder
but
he
had
no
weapon
and
vainly
sought
one
whilst
he
turned
around
the
room
he
had
not
even
a
knife
nothing
save
his
two
hands
with
which
he
might
strangle
her
but
what
use
would
that
be
what
could
he
do
afterwards
could
he
go
on
living
a
knife
would
have
sufficed
for
both
she
noticed
his
embarrassment
his
momentary
hesitation
and
triumphed
over
it
believing
that
he
would
not
again
find
the
strength
to
kill
her
and
in
her
turn
she
began
to
laugh
with
an
insulting
taunting
laugh
are
you
not
going
to
kill
me
then
kill
me
kill
me
then
if
you
dare
all
at
once
in
the
midst
of
his
wild
search
for
a
weapon
delaveau
perceived
the
stove
in
which
such
a
brasier
of
coke
was
glowing
that
the
room
seemed
to
be
on
fire
already
and
utter
dementia
suddenly
fell
upon
him
making
him
forget
everything
even
his
daughter
his
nise
who
was
sleeping
quietly
in
her
little
room
on
the
second
floor
oh
to
make
an
end
of
himself
annihilate
himself
amidst
the
fury
which
transported
him
oh
to
carry
that
hateful
woman
to
death
so
that
she
might
never
more
belong
to
another
and
to
go
with
her
and
cease
to
live
since
life
was
now
utterly
soiled
and
wrecked
she
was
still
urging
him
on
with
her
lashing
contemptuous
laugh
me
kill
me
then
you
are
far
too
big
a
coward
to
kill
me
yes
yes
thought
delaveau
to
burn
everything
to
destroy
everything
by
a
huge
conflagration
in
which
the
house
and
the
works
alike
would
disappear
a
conflagration
which
would
complete
the
work
of
ruin
carried
on
by
that
woman
and
her
idiotic
lover
ay
a
gigantic
pyre
on
which
he
himself
would
crumble
into
ashes
with
that
malignant
devouring
lying
creature
amidst
the
smoking
ruins
of
that
old
social
system
which
he
had
so
foolishly
striven
to
defend
with
a
terrible
kick
he
overturned
the
stove
and
projected
it
into
the
middle
of
the
room
ever
repeating
his
shout
shall
die
you
shall
die
the
coke
spread
in
a
red
sheet
over
the
carpet
some
pieces
rolled
as
far
as
one
of
the
windows
then
the
cretonne
curtains
were
the
first
to
flare
whilst
the
carpet
began
to
burn
the
furniture
and
the
walls
flamed
in
their
turn
with
overwhelming
rapidity
the
house
which
was
but
lightly
built
caught
fire
and
sparkled
and
smoked
like
a
mere
wisp
of
hay
the
rest
was
frightful
fernande
had
sprung
up
in
her
terror
gathering
the
silk
and
lace
of
her
skirts
together
and
seeking
a
passage
where
the
flames
would
not
reach
them
she
darted
towards
the
door
opening
into
the
hall
feeling
certain
that
she
would
have
time
to
escape
that
she
would
reach
the
garden
at
a
bound
but
in
front
of
the
door
she
found
delaveau
whose
arms
barred
her
passage
he
looked
so
terrible
that
she
then
sprang
towards
the
other
door
the
one
which
opened
into
the
wooden
gallery
connecting
the
room
with
the
works
but
it
was
too
late
to
flee
in
that
direction
the
gallery
was
burning
acting
like
a
chimney
in
which
the
draught
urged
on
the
flames
with
such
rapidity
that
the
adjacent
business
offices
were
already
threatened
so
she
came
back
to
the
centre
of
the
room
stumbling
blinded
suffocating
full
of
rage
and
terror
at
feeling
that
her
dress
was
flaring
that
her
uncoiled
hair
also
was
catching
fire
covering
her
bare
shoulders
with
burns
and
in
a
frightful
voice
she
gasped
will
not
die
i
will
not
die
let
me
pass
murderer
murderer
then
again
she
threw
herself
towards
the
door
opening
into
the
hall
and
strove
to
force
a
passage
rushing
upon
her
husband
who
still
stood
there
erect
and
motionless
full
of
fierce
determination
without
any
violence
he
simply
repeated
tell
you
that
you
are
going
to
die
to
force
him
to
give
way
she
dug
her
nails
into
his
flesh
and
then
only
did
he
catch
hold
of
her
again
and
bring
her
back
into
the
centre
of
the
room
which
had
now
become
a
perfect
brasier
and
here
there
was
a
horrible
battle
she
struggled
with
all
her
strength
which
was
increased
tenfold
by
the
dread
of
death
she
sought
the
doors
the
windows
with
the
instinctive
eagerness
of
a
wounded
animal
whilst
he
still
kept
her
amidst
the
flames
in
which
he
wished
to
die
and
in
which
he
wished
her
to
perish
with
him
in
order
that
the
whole
of
their
abominable
existence
might
be
annihilated
and
to
accomplish
this
he
needed
all
the
strength
of
his
strong
arms
for
the
walls
were
cracking
and
ten
times
in
succession
did
he
have
to
drag
her
from
the
outlets
by
which
she
might
have
escaped
at
last
he
imprisoned
her
in
a
final
savage
embrace
and
they
fell
together
amidst
the
embers
of
the
flooring
whilst
the
last
hangings
burnt
away
like
torches
and
ardent
brands
rained
from
the
woodwork
overhead
and
although
she
bit
him
he
did
not
release
her
but
held
her
fast
carrying
her
away
into
nothingness
both
of
them
burning
together
with
the
same
avenging
fire
soon
all
was
over
the
ceiling
fell
upon
them
with
a
great
crumbling
of
flaming
beams
that
night
at
la
crÃªcherie
as
nanet
left
the
machinery
gallery
where
he
was
now
serving
his
apprenticeship
as
an
electrician
he
perceived
a
red
glow
in
the
direction
of
the
abyss
at
first
he
imagined
that
it
came
from
the
cementing
furnaces
but
its
brightness
increased
and
all
at
once
he
understood
the
truth
the
manager
house
was
on
fire
he
experienced
a
sudden
shock
for
he
thought
of
nise
and
then
ran
off
wildly
and
came
into
collision
with
the
over
which
in
former
times
they
had
both
climbed
so
nimbly
in
order
to
be
together
and
once
again
with
the
help
of
hands
and
feet
he
somehow
got
over
the
wall
and
found
himself
in
the
garden
alone
as
yet
for
no
alarm
had
been
given
it
was
indeed
the
house
that
was
burning
and
the
frightful
feature
of
the
conflagration
was
that
like
a
fire
lighted
at
the
base
of
some
huge
pyre
it
spread
from
to
roof
without
anybody
within
showing
sign
of
life
the
windows
remained
closed
and
the
door
was
already
burning
in
such
wise
that
one
could
neither
go
in
nor
out
it
merely
seemed
to
nanet
that
he
could
hear
some
loud
cries
and
a
commotion
like
that
of
some
horrible
death
struggle
but
at
last
the
shutters
of
one
of
the
windows
were
flung
back
violently
and
then
amidst
the
smoke
appeared
nise
all
in
white
wearing
only
her
chemise
and
a
petticoat
she
called
for
help
and
leant
out
terrified
be
frightened
do
be
frightened
cried
nanet
in
distraction
going
up
he
had
perceived
a
long
ladder
lying
alongside
a
shed
but
on
going
to
take
it
he
found
that
it
was
chained
a
moment
of
terrible
anguish
ensued
the
lad
took
up
a
large
stone
and
struck
the
padlock
with
all
his
strength
in
order
to
break
it
meantime
the
flames
were
roaring
and
the
whole
of
the
first
floor
took
fire
amidst
such
an
outpouring
of
smoke
and
sparks
that
at
certain
moments
nise
up
above
quite
disappeared
from
sight
nanet
still
heard
her
cries
however
which
grew
wilder
and
wilder
and
he
struck
and
struck
the
padlock
whilst
calling
in
response
wait
i
coming
at
last
the
padlock
was
crushed
and
he
was
able
to
take
the
ladder
he
never
remembered
afterwards
how
he
had
managed
to
set
it
erect
it
was
a
prodigious
feat
but
he
was
able
to
rear
it
under
the
window
then
however
he
perceived
that
it
was
too
short
and
such
was
his
despair
at
the
discovery
that
his
courage
wavered
boy
hero
that
he
was
only
sixteen
years
of
age
he
was
resolved
to
save
that
young
girl
of
thirteen
his
friend
and
playmate
but
he
was
losing
his
head
and
no
longer
knew
how
to
act
nevertheless
he
called
again
wait
it
does
matter
come
somehow
at
that
moment
one
of
the
two
servant
girls
whose
garret
bedroom
had
a
window
opening
on
to
the
roof
managed
to
get
out
clutching
hold
of
the
guttering
but
maddened
by
terror
imagining
that
the
flames
were
already
reaching
her
she
suddenly
leapt
into
space
and
fell
dead
with
her
skull
broken
beside
the
flight
of
steps
nanet
unhinged
by
nise
cries
which
had
become
more
and
more
frightful
fancied
that
she
also
was
about
to
jump
out
he
pictured
her
lying
at
his
feet
covered
with
blood
and
he
raised
a
last
terrible
call
jump
i
coming
i
coming
then
in
spite
of
everything
the
young
fellow
ascended
the
ladder
and
when
he
reached
the
burning
first
floor
he
entered
the
house
by
one
of
the
windows
whose
panes
had
been
burst
by
the
violence
of
the
heat
help
was
now
arriving
there
were
a
number
of
people
already
on
the
road
and
in
the
garden
and
the
throng
spent
some
minutes
of
frightful
anxiety
in
watching
one
child
save
the
other
with
such
wild
bravery
the
conflagration
was
still
and
ever
spreading
the
walls
cracked
and
the
very
ladder
seemed
to
ignite
as
it
stood
against
the
house
front
whilst
neither
the
boy
nor
the
girl
reappeared
but
at
last
nanet
came
back
carrying
nise
on
his
shoulders
as
a
shepherd
may
carry
a
lamb
he
had
managed
to
climb
through
the
furnace
from
one
story
to
the
other
take
her
up
and
come
down
again
but
his
hair
was
singed
and
his
clothes
were
burning
and
when
he
had
slipped
rather
than
stepped
down
the
ladder
with
his
burden
both
he
and
she
were
covered
with
burns
and
fell
fainting
in
one
another
arms
clasped
in
so
close
an
embrace
that
they
had
to
be
carried
thus
to
la
crÃªcherie
whither
sÅurette
who
had
now
been
warned
repaired
to
nurse
them
half
an
hour
later
the
house
fell
not
a
stone
of
it
remained
standing
and
the
worst
was
that
the
fire
after
reaching
the
general
offices
by
way
of
the
wooden
gallery
had
now
gained
the
neighbouring
buildings
and
was
devouring
the
great
hall
where
the
and
the
were
installed
the
entire
works
were
in
danger
the
fire
blazed
amidst
those
old
buildings
almost
all
of
which
were
of
dry
woodwork
it
was
said
that
the
delaveaus
other
servant
having
managed
to
escape
by
way
of
the
kitchen
had
been
the
first
to
give
the
alarm
to
the
who
had
hurried
up
from
the
works
but
they
had
no
and
nothing
could
be
done
till
their
comrades
of
la
crÃªcherie
headed
by
luc
himself
came
in
brotherly
fashion
to
the
help
of
the
rival
establishment
with
both
engine
and
firemen
the
beauclair
fire
brigade
whose
organisation
was
very
defective
only
turned
up
afterwards
and
it
was
too
late
to
save
the
abyss
it
was
now
blazing
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
its
sordid
workshops
over
an
expanse
of
several
acres
forming
a
huge
brasier
whence
emerged
only
the
lofty
chimneys
and
the
tower
in
which
great
cannon
were
tempered
when
the
dawn
rose
after
that
night
of
disaster
numerous
groups
of
people
still
stood
before
the
smouldering
wreckage
under
the
livid
chilly
november
sky
the
beauclair
authorities
chÃ¢telard
and
mayor
gourier
had
not
quitted
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
and
judge
gaume
was
with
them
as
well
as
his
captain
jollivet
abbÃ©
marle
warned
late
only
arrived
when
it
was
light
and
was
soon
followed
by
a
stream
of
inquisitive
folk
and
shopkeepers
the
mazelles
the
laboques
the
caffiaux
and
even
dacheux
a
gust
of
terror
was
sweeping
by
one
and
all
spoke
with
bated
breath
their
great
anxiety
being
to
know
how
such
a
catastrophe
could
possibly
have
taken
place
only
one
witness
remained
the
who
had
managed
to
escape
she
related
that
madame
had
returned
from
la
guerdache
about
midnight
and
that
immediately
afterwards
there
had
been
some
loud
shouting
after
which
the
flames
had
suddenly
appeared
people
listened
to
her
and
repeated
her
story
in
low
tones
and
those
who
had
been
intimate
with
the
delaveaus
divined
the
frightful
tragedy
which
had
taken
place
it
was
evident
as
the
servant
said
that
monsieur
and
madame
had
perished
in
the
fire
the
horror
which
was
spreading
increased
still
further
on
the
arrival
of
boisgelin
who
had
to
be
helped
out
of
his
carriage
such
was
his
faintness
and
pallor
he
ended
by
swooning
and
doctor
novarre
had
to
attend
to
him
there
before
that
field
of
ruin
where
the
remnants
of
his
fortune
were
smoking
and
where
the
bones
of
delaveau
and
fernande
were
at
last
crumbling
into
dust
however
luc
continued
directing
the
last
efforts
made
by
his
men
to
save
the
still
burning
gallery
where
the
was
installed
jordan
wrapped
in
a
rug
obstinately
remained
in
spite
of
the
intense
cold
bonnaire
who
had
arrived
one
of
the
first
had
distinguished
himself
by
his
courage
in
saving
such
machinery
and
appliances
as

only
remained
against

supporting
the

the

by

had
just
followed
the

skirting
the
works
and
the
growing
town
of
la
crÃªcherie
which
looked
so
bright
and
gay
in
the
dry
sunshiny
weather
and
now
he
beheld
the
field
of
defeat
the
abyss
sacked
and
destroyed
by
the
violence
of
the
flames
for
a
long
time
his
clear
and
empty
eyes
as
transparent
as
spring
water
gazed
upon
the
scene
he
spoke
no
word
he
made
no
gesture
he
simply
looked
and
then
was
wheeled
away
nothing
about
him
telling
whether
he
had
really
seen
and

i
the
blow
was
a
terrible
one
at
la
guerdache
ruin
suddenly
fell
upon
that
residence
of
luxury
and
pleasure
which
had
continually
resounded
with
festivities
a
hunt
had
to
be
countermanded
and
it
was
necessary
to
stop
the
grand
tuesday
dinners
the
numerous
domestics
would
have
to
be
discharged
and
there
was
already
some
talk
of
the
sale
of
the
carriages
horses
and
kennels
all
the
noisy
life
of
the
gardens
and
park
the
endless
affluence
of
visitors
had
ceased
in
the
huge
house
itself
the
and
became
so
many
deserts
quivering
with
the
blast
of
disaster
it
was
a
stricken
dwelling
agonising
in
the
sudden
solitude
born
of
misfortune
to
and
fro
through
that
infinite
sadness
went
boisgelin
like
a
woeful
shadow
utterly
overcome
with
his
mind
almost
unhinged
he
spent
the
most
frightful
days
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
himself
wandering
about
like
a
soul
in
distress
amidst
the
downfall
of
his
life
of
enjoyment
he
was
at
bottom
a
sorry
being
a
horseman
and
clubman
an
amiable
mediocrity
whose
fine
presence
and
correct
proud
mien
the
mien
of
the
fool
who
wears
a
single
eyeglass
collapsed
entirely
at
the
first
tragic
gust
of
truth
and
justice
he
had
hitherto
taken
his
pleasures
like
one
convinced
that
they
were
due
to
him
he
had
never
done
the
slightest
work
in
his
life
he
imagined
himself
to
be
different
from
others
a
privileged
being
one
of
the
elect
born
to
be
fed
and
amused
by
the
labour
of
others
and
so
how
could
he
have
understood
the
catastrophe
which
had
so
logically
fallen
upon
him
his
egotistical
creed
had
received
too
severe
a
shock
and
he
remained
in
dismay
before
the
future
respecting
which
he
had
not
previously
felt
any
disquietude
in
the
depths
of
his
bewilderment
there
was
particularly
the
terror
of
the
idler
the
one
who
was
utterly
upset
by
the
thought
that
he
was
incapable
of
earning
his
living
as
delaveau
was
gone
from
whom
could
he
now
demand
the
profits
which
had
been
promised
him
on
the
day
when
he
had
invested
his
capital
in
the
abyss
the
works
were
burnt
the
capital
had
vanished
in
the
ruins
and
where
would
he
now
find
the
money
to
live
he
roamed
like
a
madman
through
the
deserted
gardens
and
the
lugubrious
house
without
finding
an
answer
to
that
question
at
first
on
the
evening
following
the
tragedy
boisgelin
was
haunted
by
thoughts
of
the
frightful
death
of
delaveau
and
fernande
he
could
have
no
doubt
on
the
matter
for
he
remembered
in
what
a
mood
the
young
woman
had
left
him
full
of
wrath
and
pouring
forth
threats
against
her
husband
it
was
certainly
delaveau
who
after
some
terrible
scene
had
set
fire
to
the
house
in
order
to
destroy
both
the
guilty
woman
and
himself
in
that
vengeance
for
a
mere
enjoyer
of
life
like
boisgelin
there
was
a
sombre
ferocity
a
monstrous
violence
which
inspired
him
with
unending
fright
but
the
greatest
blow
was
to
understand
that
he
was
deficient
in
strength
of
intellect
and
that
he
lacked
the
necessary
energy
to
set
his
affairs
in
order
from
morning
till
evening
he
ruminated
over
various
plans
without
knowing
which
to
adopt
would
it
be
best
to
try
to
resuscitate
the
works
seek
money
and
an
engineer
endeavour
to
establish
a
company
to
carry
on
the
business
he
feared
that
he
might
not
succeed
in
such
attempts
for
the
losses
were
very
great
and
must
in
the
first
instance
be
made
good
ought
he
not
rather
to
wait
for
a
purchaser
who
would
take
the
land
and
such
plant
and
materials
as
had
been
saved
at
his
risk
and
peril
but
boisgelin
greatly
doubted
whether
such
a
purchaser
would
ever
turn
up
and
in
particular
he
doubted
whether
he
would
obtain
from
him
a
sufficiently
large
sum
to
liquidate
the
situation
moreover
the
question
of
his
future
life
still
remained
to
be
settled
for
the
estate
of
la
guerdache
was
an
expensive
one
to
keep
up
and
perhaps
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
would
no
longer
have
enough
money
to
buy
even
bread
in
this
emergency
one
sole
creature
took
pity
on
the
wretched
trembling
forsaken
man
who
roamed
about
his
empty
house
like
a
lost
child
and
this
was
suzanne
his
wife
that
woman
full
of
heroic
gentleness
whom
he
had
so
cruelly
outraged
at
the
outset
when
he
had
imposed
his
with
fernande
upon
her
she
had
again
and
again
resolved
upon
asserting
herself
and
driving
the
intruder
the
strange
woman
from
her
house
but
in
the
end
she
had
invariably
refrained
from
taking
that
course
for
she
felt
certain
that
if
she
were
to
drive
fernande
away
her
infatuated
husband
would
follow
her
then
their
relative
positions
being
settled
suzanne
had
taken
a
room
for
herself
and
had
become
a
wife
in
name
only
keeping
up
appearances
in
the
presence
of
visitors
but
devoting
herself
entirely
to
the
education
of
paul
whom
she
wished
to
save
from
disaster
had
it
not
been
for
that
dear
child
fair
and
gentle
like
herself
she
would
never
have
become
resigned
to
the
position
it
was
he
who
had
brought
about
her
renunciation
her
sacrifice
she
had
removed
him
as
much
as
possible
from
the
influence
of
his
unworthy
father
anxious
that
his
mind
and
heart
in
which
by
way
of
consolation
she
hoped
to
cultivate
sense
and
kindliness
should
belong
to
herself
alone
in
this
wise
years
went
by
amidst
the
delight
of
seeing
him
grow
up
reasonable
and
affectionate
and
it
was
only
from
a
distance
so
to
say
that
suzanne
had
beheld
the
slow
ruin
of
the
abyss
and
the
growing
prosperity
of
la
crÃªcherie
like
her
husband
she
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
delaveau
informed
of
the
truth
had
personally
fired
that
huge
pyre
in
order
to
destroy
himself
with
that
corrupting
devouring
creature
his
guilty
wife
suzanne
shuddered
as
she
thought
of
it
and
asked
herself
if
she
had
not
in
some
small
degree
contributed
to
the
catastrophe
by
her
own
resignation
her
weakness
in
tolerating
betrayal
and
shame
in
her
own
home
during
so
many
years
if
she
had
only
rebelled
at
the
outset
perhaps
the
crime
would
never
have
reached
that
climax
and
her
qualms
of
conscience
quite
upset
her
and
moved
her
to
compassion
for
the
wretched
man
whom
since
the
days
of
the
catastrophe
she
had
seen
roaming
about
like
one
demented
through
the
deserted
garden
and
the
empty
house
one
morning
as
she
herself
was
crossing
the
grand
where
boisgelin
had
given
so
many
she
perceived
him
there
huddled
up
on
an
and
sobbing
and
weeping
like
a
child
she
was
quite
stirred
filled
with
pity
at
the
sight
and
she
who
for
many
years
had
never
spoken
to
him
unless
it
were
necessary
to
do
so
in
the
presence
of
guests
drew
near
and
said
is
not
in
despairing
that
you
will
find
the
strength
you
need
amazed
at
seeing
her
there
at
hearing
her
speak
to
him
he
looked
at
her
through
the
tears
which
blurred
his
eyes
she
continued
is
of
no
use
roaming
about
from
morning
till
night
you
must
find
courage
in
yourself
you
will
not
find
it
elsewhere
he
made
a
gesture
expressive
of
desolation
and
answered
in
a
faint
voice
am
so
much
alone
he
was
not
by
nature
an
evilly
disposed
man
he
was
simply
a
fool
and
a
weakling
one
of
those
cowards
whom
egotistical
pleasure
turns
into
brutes
and
it
was
with
such
utter
dejection
that
he
complained
of
the
solitude
in
which
she
left
him
amidst
his
misfortune
that
she
again
felt
very
touched
mean
she
said
you
wished
to
be
alone
since
those
frightful
occurrences
why
have
you
not
come
to
me
god
he
stammered
you
forgive
me
then
he
caught
hold
of
her
hands
which
she
left
in
his
grasp
and
overwhelmed
and
wildly
repentant
confessed
his
fault
he
acknowledged
nothing
but
what
she
knew
already
his
long
betrayal
the
mistress
whom
he
had
brought
into
his
home
that
woman
who
had
maddened
him
and
urged
him
on
to
ruin
but
in
accusing
himself
he
displayed
such
passionate
frankness
that
suzanne
was
touched
as
by
some
spontaneous
confession
which
he
might
have
spared
himself
is
true
he
ended
by
saying
have
wronged
you
so
long
i
have
behaved
abominably
ah
why
did
you
abandon
me
why
did
you
try
nothing
to
win
me
back
his
words
awoke
in
her
those
qualms
of
conscience
the
covert
remorse
which
she
felt
at
the
thought
that
she
had
perhaps
not
done
all
her
duty
that
she
had
erred
in
not
trying
to
stop
him
on
his
downward
course
and
the
reconciliation
which
pity
had
initiated
was
completed
by
a
feeling
of
indulgence
are
not
the
most
pure
the
most
heroic
partially
responsible
at
times
when
the
weak
and
the
erring
succumb
around
them
she
said
ought
to
have
battled
more
but
i
was
too
intent
on
sparing
my
pride
and
procuring
quietude
we
both
have
need
of
forgetfulness
we
must
regard
all
the
past
as
dead
then
as
their
son
paul
happened
to
pass
through
the
garden
under
the
windows
she
called
him
indoors
he
was
now
a
big
fellow
of
eighteen
intelligent
and
refined
a
son
after
her
own
image
very
affectionate
and
very
sensible
free
from
all
caste
prejudices
and
ready
to
live
on
the
fruit
of
his
own
exertions
whenever
circumstances
might
require
it
he
had
begun
to
take
a
passionate
interest
in
the
land
and
spent
whole
days
at
the
farm
busy
with
questions
of
culture
the
germination
of
seed
and
harvesting
of
crops
as
it
happened
when
his
mother
asked
him
to
come
in
for
a
moment
he
was
about
to
repair
to
feuillat
to
see
a
new
type
of
plough
in
my
boy
your
father
is
in
great
grief
and
i
wish
you
to
kiss
him
said
suzanne
there
had
been
a
rupture
between
father
and
son
as
between
husband
and
wife
won
over
entirely
to
his
mother
side
paul
in
growing
up
had
felt
nothing
but
cold
respect
for
his
father
whose
conduct
he
divined
must
be
the
cause
of
his
mother
frequent
sorrow
thus
he
now
came
into
the
feeling
both
surprised
and
moved
and
for
a
few
seconds
remained
gazing
at
his
parents
whom
he
found
so
pale
so
upset
by
emotion
then
understanding
the
position
he
kissed
his
father
very
affectionately
and
flung
his
arms
around
his
neck
anxious
to
embrace
her
also
with
all
his
heart
the
family
bond
was
formed
once
more
and
there
came
a
happy
moment
when
one
might
have
believed
that
agreement
would
henceforth
be
complete
between
them
when
suzanne
in
her
turn
had
kissed
her
son
boisgelin
had
to
restrain
a
fresh
flow
of
tears
good
now
we
all
agree
ah
that
gives
me
some
courage
again
we
are
in
such
a
terrible
position
we
shall
have
to
come
to
some
arrangement
take
some
decision
they
went
on
talking
for
a
little
while
all
three
of
them
seated
there
together
for
boisgelin
felt
a
desire
to
unburden
himself
and
confide
in
that
woman
and
that
lad
after
roaming
about
alone
so
distressfully
he
reminded
suzanne
how
they
had
bought
the
abyss
for
a
million
and
la
guerdache
for
five
hundred
thousand
francs
out
of
the
two
millions
which
had
remained
to
them
the
one
which
had
formed
her
dowry
and
the
other
which
had
been
saved
in
the
wreck
of
his
own
fortune
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
left
out
of
the
two
millions
had
been
handed
to
delaveau
and
had
served
as
working
capital
for
the
abyss
all
their
money
was
thus
invested
in
that
enterprise
but
unfortunately
during
recent
financial
embarrassments
it
had
been
necessary
to
borrow
six
hundred
thousand
francs
a
debt
which
had
weighed
heavily
upon
the
business
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
works
were
quite
dead
since
they
were
burnt
and
besides
before
erecting
them
afresh
it
would
be
necessary
to
pay
the
debt
of
six
hundred
thousand
francs
what
do
you
intend
to
do
suzanne
inquired
boisgelin
thereupon
explained
the
two
solutions
between
which
he
hesitated
unable
to
adopt
either
so
great
were
the
difficulties
which
attended
both
on
the
one
hand
they
might
rid
themselves
of
everything
sell
what
remained
of
the
abyss
for
what
it
would
fetch
that
is
no
doubt
barely
enough
to
pay
the
outstanding
debt
of
six
hundred
thousand
francs
or
on
the
other
hand
they
might
try
to
find
fresh
funds
and
establish
a
company
to
which
he
would
belong
by
contributing
the
land
and
the
plant
that
had
been
saved
but
here
again
there
seemed
little
hope
of
effecting
such
a
combination
meantime
a
solution
was
every
day
becoming
more
necessary
for
their
ruin
was
growing
more
and
more
complete
also
have
la
guerdache
we
can
sell
it
remarked
suzanne
sell
la
guerdache
he
answered
in
a
despairing
way
with
this
property
to
which
we
are
so
accustomed
so
attached
and
all
to
go
and
hide
ourselves
in
some
wretched
hovel
what
a
downfall
it
would
be
what
a
lot
more
grief
it
would
bring
suzanne
became
grave
again
for
she
well
perceived
that
he
was
not
resigned
to
the
idea
of
leading
a
reasonable
modest
life
shall
inevitably
have
to
come
to
it
my
friend
said
she
can
not
continue
living
upon
such
a
footing
doubt
no
doubt
we
shall
sell
la
guerdache
but
later
on
when
an
opportunity
presents
itself
if
we
were
to
put
it
up
for
sale
now
we
should
not
obtain
half
its
value
for
in
doing
so
we
should
confess
our
ruin
and
the
whole
district
would
league
itself
against
us
to
rejoice
and
speculate
on
our
misfortunes
then
he
added
more
direct
arguments
my
dear
la
guerdache
belongs
to
you
as
is
stated
in
the
deeds
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
of
the
purchase
money
were
taken
from
your
dowry
the
remaining
five
hundred
thousand
francs
of
which
formed
half
of
the
million
which
the
abyss
cost
us
whilst
we
are
of
the
works
la
guerdache
is
entirely
your
own
property
and
i
simply
desire
to
keep
it
for
you
as
long
as
possible
suzanne
did
not
wish
to
insist
on
the
subject
but
she
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
say
that
she
had
long
since
resigned
herself
to
every
sacrifice
her
husband
was
looking
at
her
and
all
at
once
he
seemed
to
remember
something
by
the
way
he
exclaimed
a
question
to
ask
you
have
you
ever
seen
your
old
friend
monsieur
luc
froment
again
she
remained
for
a
moment
stupefied
following
upon
the
foundation
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
acute
rivalry
which
had
ensued
between
that
enterprise
and
the
abyss
had
come
a
rupture
with
luc
a
rupture
which
had
not
been
the
slightest
of
her
sorrows
amongst
her
many
bitter
experiences
she
felt
that
she
had
lost
in
luc
a
cordial
consoling
brotherly
friend
who
would
have
helped
and
sustained
her
but
once
again
she
had
resigned
herself
and
whenever
she
had
chanced
to
meet
him
at
long
intervals
on
one
of
the
few
occasions
when
she
went
out
she
had
never
spoken
to
him
he
imitated
her
discretion
and
renunciation
and
it
seemed
as
if
their
old
intimacy
were
quite
dead
still
this
did
not
prevent
suzanne
from
taking
quite
a
passionate
interest
in
luc
enterprise
an
interest
of
which
she
spoke
to
nobody
in
secret
she
remained
upon
his
side
in
the
generous
efforts
which
he
was
making
to
set
a
little
more
justice
and
love
upon
the
earth
thus
she
had
suffered
with
him
and
triumphed
with
him
and
when
at
one
moment
she
had
imagined
him
to
be
dead
killed
by
ragu
she
had
for
hours
shut
herself
up
alone
far
away
from
everybody
in
the
depths
of
her
grief
she
had
then
discovered
an
intolerable
anguish
that
with
josine
which
ragu
crime
had
revealed
to
her
left
a
torturing
wound
in
her
heart
had
she
then
been
in
love
with
luc
without
knowing
it
perhaps
so
for
had
she
not
dreamt
of
the
joy
the
pride
that
she
would
have
felt
at
having
such
a
husband
as
he
one
who
would
have
turned
fortune
to
such
good
and
magnificent
use
had
she
not
thought
too
that
she
would
have
helped
him
and
that
between
them
they
would
have
accomplished
prodigies
in
the
cause
of
peace
and
kindness
but
he
grew
well
again
and
was
now
the
husband
of
josine
and
suzanne
felt
everything
crumbling
once
more
leaving
her
nought
but
the
abnegation
of
a
sacrificed
wife
of
a
mother
who
only
continued
living
for
her
son
sake
from
that
moment
luc
ceased
to
exist
for
her
and
the
question
which
her
husband
had
now
put
revived
what
seemed
to
be
such
a
distant
past
that
she
was
unable
to
hide
her
surprise
can
i
have
seen
monsieur
froment
again
she
at
last
answered
know
that
for
more
than
ten
years
all
intercourse
between
us
has
been
broken
off
but
boisgelin
quietly
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
does
prevent
it
you
might
have
met
him
and
have
spoken
to
him
you
agreed
so
well
together
formerly
so
you
have
kept
up
no
relations
with
him
at
all
she
answered
somewhat
sharply
i
had
you
would
know
it
her
astonishment
was
increasing
she
felt
hurt
by
her
insistence
ashamed
too
at
being
questioned
in
that
manner
what
could
be
his
object
why
did
he
wish
that
she
had
kept
up
relations
with
luc
in
her
turn
she
felt
inquisitive
and
inquired
do
you
ask
me
that
for
nothing
only
an
idea
which
occurred
to
me
just
now
finally
he
reverted
to
the
subject
and
revealed
what
he
had
on
his
mind
is
it
i
was
telling
you
a
little
while
ago
that
we
could
adopt
one
of
two
courses
either
sell
the
abyss
rid
ourselves
of
everything
or
start
a
company
to
which
i
should
belong
well
also
a
third
course
a
combination
as
it
were
of
both
the
others
and
that
would
be
to
sell
the
abyss
to
la
crÃªcherie
but
in
such
a
way
as
to
reserve
to
ourselves
the
larger
part
of
the
profits
do
you
understand
not
exactly
it
is
very
simple
that
fellow
luc
must
have
a
great
desire
to
acquire
our
land
well
he
has
done
us
enough
harm
is
that
not
so
and
it
is
quite
legitimate
that
we
should
get
a
large
sum
out
of
him
and
our
salvation
certainly
lies
in
that
direction
particularly
if
we
acquire
an
interest
in
the
business
which
would
enable
us
to
keep
la
guerdache
without
need
of
retrenchment
in
our
manner
of
life
suzanne
listened
with
sorrow
and
dismay
what
he
was
still
the
same
man
as
formerly
that
frightful
lesson
had
not
corrected
him
he
only
dreamt
of
speculating
on
others
of
deriving
profit
from
the
situation
in
which
they
found
themselves
and
in
particular
he
still
had
one
sole
object
that
of
doing
nothing
of
remaining
an
idler
a
otherwise
a
capitalist
in
the
wild
despair
amidst
which
he
had
been
struggling
since
the
catastrophe
there
had
been
but
terror
hatred
of
work
and
one
haunting
thought
how
could
he
so
arrange
matters
that
he
might
continue
to
live
doing
nothing
his
tears
were
already
dry
and
now
all
at
once
he
reappeared
such
as
he
really
was
a
man
intent
on
enjoyment
however
suzanne
wished
to
know
everything
what
have
i
to
do
with
this
matter
she
inquired
did
you
ask
me
if
i
had
kept
up
any
relations
with
monsieur
froment
dieu
he
quietly
replied
that
would
have
facilitated
the
overtures
which
i
think
of
making
to
him
as
you
can
understand
after
years
of
rupture
it
is
not
easy
to
approach
a
man
to
discuss
questions
of
interest
whereas
things
would
be
much
easier
if
he
had
remained
your
friend
in
that
case
you
yourself
perhaps
might
have
seen
him
spoken
to
him
with
a
sudden
wave
of
her
hand
suzanne
stopped
her
husband
would
never
have
spoken
to
monsieur
froment
under
such
circumstances
you
forget
that
i
had
a
sisterly
affection
for
him
ah
the
wretched
being
so
now
he
had
sunk
to
so
low
a
degree
of
baseness
that
he
was
ready
to
speculate
on
such
affection
as
luc
might
have
retained
for
her
and
it
was
she
whom
he
thought
of
employing
to
touch
his
adversary
in
such
wise
that
the
latter
might
then
be
more
easily
conquered
boisgelin
must
have
understood
that
he
had
hurt
suzanne
feelings
for
he
could
see
that
she
had
become
much
paler
and
colder
as
if
she
had
again
withdrawn
from
him
he
wished
to
efface
that
bad
impression
are
right
said
he
is
not
a
thing
for
women
to
attend
to
as
you
say
also
you
could
not
have
undertaken
such
a
commission
but
all
the
same
i
am
well
pleased
with
my
idea
for
the
more
i
think
it
over
the
more
convinced
i
feel
that
our
salvation
lies
in
it
i
shall
prepare
my
plan
of
attack
and
find
a
means
of
opening
up
intercourse
with
the
director
of
la
crÃªcherie
unless
indeed
i
allow
him
to
take
the
first
steps
which
would
be
a
more
skilful
course
he
was
quite
enlivened
by
the
hope
of
duping
another
and
deriving
sustenance
and
pleasure
from
him
as
he
had
hitherto
done
there
would
still
be
something
good
in
life
if
one
could
live
it
with
white
and
idle
hands
ignorant
of
work
he
rose
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
looked
on
the
great
park
it
seemed
more
extensive
still
on
that
clear
winter
day
and
he
hoped
to
give
fÃªtes
in
it
again
as
soon
as
the
spring
should
come
finally
he
exclaimed
would
really
be
too
stupid
for
us
to
distress
ourselves
can
folk
like
ourselves
ever
become
paupers
suzanne
who
had
remained
seated
felt
her
painful
sadness
increase
for
a
moment
she
had
entertained
the
naÃ¯ve
hope
of
reforming
that
man
and
now
she
perceived
that
every
tempest
and
revolution
might
pass
over
him
without
bringing
amendment
or
even
understanding
of
the
new
times
the
ancient
system
of
the
exploitation
of
man
by
man
was
in
his
blood
he
could
only
live
on
others
he
would
always
remain
a
big
bad
child
who
would
fall
to
her
charge
later
on
should
justice
ever
do
its
work
and
thus
she
could
only
regard
him
with
great
and
bitter
pity
throughout
that
long
conversation
paul
had
remained
motionless
listening
to
his
parents
with
his
usual
gentle
intelligent
and
loving
expression
all
the
feelings
which
in
turn
agitated
his
mother
were
reflected
in
his
large
pensive
eyes
he
was
in
constant
communion
with
her
and
suffered
like
herself
at
seeing
how
unworthy
his
father
was
she
at
last
perceived
his
painful
embarrassment
and
asked
him
were
you
going
just
now
my
child
was
going
to
the
farm
mother
feuillat
must
have
received
the
new
plough
for
the
winter
ploughing
boisgelin
laughed
that
interests
you
he
asked
yes
father
at
les
combettes
they
have
steam
ploughs
which
turn
up
furrows
several
thousand
yards
long
now
that
all
the
fields
have
been
joined
together
and
it
is
superb
to
see
the
land
turned
up
like
that
and
fertilised
he
was
overflowing
with
youthful
enthusiasm
his
mother
who
felt
touched
by
it
smiled
at
him
go
my
boy
she
said
and
see
the
new
plough
and
work
your
health
will
be
all
the
better
for
it
during
the
ensuing
days
suzanne
noticed
that
her
husband
evinced
no
haste
in
putting
his
project
into
execution
it
seemed
as
if
he
deemed
it
sufficient
to
have
discovered
a
solution
which
in
his
opinion
would
save
them
all
that
done
he
relapsed
into
indolence
incapable
of
any
effort
however
there
was
another
big
child
at
la
guerdache
whose
manner
suddenly
caused
suzanne
considerable
disquietude
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
her
grandfather
who
had
just
reached
the
advanced
age
of
in
spite
of
the
species
of
living
death
to
which
paralysis
had
reduced
him
still
led
a
silent
and
retired
existence
having
no
intercourse
with
the
outer
world
apart
from
his
frequent
promenades
in
the
which
a
servant
propelled
suzanne
alone
entered
his
room
and
ministered
to
his
wants
evincing
the
same
loving
attention
as
she
had
already
shown
when
a
mere
girl
thirty
years
previously
in
that
same
large
room
looking
towards
the
park
she
was
so
accustomed
to
the
old
man
clear
fathomless
eyes
which
seemed
as
it
were
full
of
spring
water
that
she
was
able
to
detect
the
slightest
shadow
that
passed
over
them
now
since
the
recent
tragical
events
those
eyes
had
darkened
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
water
when
rising
sand
renders
it
turbid
for
many
monotonous
years
suzanne
had
seen
nothing
in
them
and
finding
them
so
limpid
and
so
empty
had
imagined
that
power
of
thought
had
for
ever
departed
from
her
grandfather
but
was
it
now
returning
did
not
those
shadows
in
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
eyes
and
his
feverishness
of
manner
indicate
a
possible
awakening
perhaps
indeed
he
had
always
retained
his
consciousness
and
intelligence
perhaps
too
by
some
kind
of
miracle
now
when
he
was
drawing
nigh
to
death
the
hard
physical
bond
of
paralysis
was
relaxing
in
some
slight
measure
releasing
him
from
the
silence
and
immobility
in
which
he
had
so
long
lived
imprisoned
it
was
with
growing
astonishment
and
anguish
that
suzanne
watched
that
slow
work
of
deliverance
one
night
the
servant
who
propelled
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
ventured
to
stop
her
just
as
she
was
coming
from
the
old
man
room
quite
stirred
by
the
living
glance
with
which
he
had
watched
her
depart
said
the
servant
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
change
in
monsieur
he
spoke
he
spoke
she
answered
thunderstruck
even
yesterday
i
fancied
that
i
could
hear
him
stammering
words
in
an
undertone
when
we
halted
for
a
little
while
on
the
brias
road
in
front
of
the
abyss
but
when
we
passed
before
la
crÃªcherie
he
certainly
spoke
i
sure
of
it
what
did
he
say
madame
i
did
not
understand
his
words
were
disconnected
one
could
make
sense
of
them
from
that
moment
suzanne
full
of
anxious
solicitude
had
a
close
watch
kept
upon
her
grandfather
the
servant
received
orders
to
report
to
her
every
evening
what
had
happened
during
the
day
in
this
wise
she
was
able
to
follow
the
growing
fever
which
seemed
to
have
come
upon
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
he
was
possessed
by
a
desire
to
see
and
hear
he
made
it
plain
by
signs
that
he
wished
to
have
his
outings
prolonged
as
if
he
were
eager
for
the
sights
which
he
found
upon
the
roads
but
he
particularly
insisted
on
being
taken
each
day
to
the
same
spots
either
the
abyss
or
la
crÃªcherie
and
he
never
wearied
of
contemplating
the
former
sombre
ruins
and
the
latter
gay
prosperity
he
compelled
his
servant
to
slacken
his
pace
made
him
go
past
the
same
spot
several
times
and
all
the
while
he
more
and
more
distinctly
stammered
those
disjointed
words
whose
sense
was
not
yet
apparent
suzanne
quite
upset
by
this
awakening
at
last
sent
for
doctor
novarre
whoso
opinion
she
was
anxious
to
ascertain
said
she
after
explaining
the
case
to
him
can
not
conceive
how
it
frightens
me
it
is
as
if
i
were
witnessing
a
resurrection
my
heart
contracts
it
all
appears
to
me
like
some
prodigious
sign
announcing
extraordinary
events
novarre
smiled
at
her
nervousness
and
wished
to
see
things
himself
but
it
was
not
easy
to
deal
with
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
he
had
closed
his
door
to
doctors
as
well
as
to
others
and
besides
as
his
ailment
admitted
of
no
treatment
novarre
had
for
years
abstained
from
making
any
attempt
to
enter
his
room
in
the
present
instance
the
doctor
had
to
wait
for
the
old
man
in
the
park
where
he
bowed
to
him
as
he
passed
in
his
next
he
followed
him
along
the
road
and
on
drawing
near
saw
that
his
eyes
began
to
gleam
whilst
his
lips
parted
and
a
vague
stammering
came
from
them
in
his
turn
novarre
felt
astonished
and
stirred
were
quite
right
madame
he
came
to
tell
suzanne
case
is
a
very
singular
one
we
are
evidently
in
presence
of
some
crisis
affecting
the
whole
organism
and
arising
from
some
great
internal
shock
what
do
you
expect
will
happen
doctor
suzanne
anxiously
inquired
what
can
we
do
we
can
do
nothing
that
is
unfortunately
certain
and
as
for
foreseeing
what
such
a
condition
may
lead
to
i
wo
attempt
it
yet
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
if
such
cases
are
very
rare
they
do
occasionally
occur
thus
i
remember
examining
at
the
asylum
of
an
old
man
who
had
been
shut
up
there
for
nearly
forty
years
and
whom
the
keepers
to
the
best
of
their
remembrance
had
never
once
heard
speak
quite
suddenly
however
he
appeared
to
awake
at
first
speaking
in
a
confused
manner
and
then
very
plainly
whereupon
an
interminable
flow
of
speech
set
in
whole
hours
of
ceaseless
chatter
but
the
extraordinary
part
of
it
was
that
this
old
man
who
was
regarded
as
an
idiot
had
seen
heard
and
understood
everything
during
his
forty
years
of
apparent
slumber
and
when
he
recovered
the
power
of
speech
it
was
an
endless
narrative
of
his
sensations
and
recollections
stored
within
him
since
his
entry
into
the
asylum
that
poured
from
his
lips
although
suzanne
strove
to
hide
the
frightful
emotion
into
which
this
example
threw
her
she
could
not
help
shuddering
what
became
of
that
unhappy
man
she
asked
novarre
hesitated
for
a
second
then
replied
died
three
days
afterwards
i
must
own
it
madame
a
crisis
of
that
sort
is
almost
always
a
symptom
of
approaching
dissolution
one
finds
in
it
the
eternal
symbol
of
the
lamp
which
throws
up
a
last
flame
before
going
out
deep
silence
reigned
suzanne
had
become
very
pale
the
icy
breath
of
death
swept
by
but
it
was
not
so
much
the
thought
that
her
unhappy
grandfather
would
soon
die
that
pained
her
she
had
another
poignant
fear
had
he
seen
heard
and
understood
everything
throughout
his
long
paralysis
even
after
the
fashion
of
the
old
man
of
at
last
she
summoned
sufficient
bravery
to
ask
another
question
you
think
doctor
she
inquired
intelligence
has
quite
departed
from
our
dear
patient
in
your
opinion
does
he
understand
does
he
think
novarre
made
a
vague
gesture
the
gesture
of
the
scientist
who
does
not
consider
it
right
to
venture
on
any
pronouncement
respecting
matters
outside
the
pale
of
scientific
certainty
you
ask
me
too
much
madame
said
he
is
possible
in
that
mystery
the
human
brain
into
which
we
still
penetrate
with
so
much
difficulty
intelligence
can
certainly
remain
intact
after
the
loss
of
speech
because
one
can
not
speak
it
does
not
follow
that
one
is
unable
to
think
however
i
may
say
that
i
should
formerly
have
believed
in
a
permanent
weakening
of
all
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
mental
faculties
i
should
have
thought
him
sunk
in
senile
infancy
for
ever
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
retained
his
faculties
intact
possible
i
even
begin
to
suspect
that
such
is
the
case
as
is
indicated
by
that
awakening
of
his
whole
being
and
that
return
of
speech
which
seems
to
be
coming
back
to
him
gradually
this
conversation
left
suzanne
in
a
state
of
dolorous
horror
she
could
no
longer
linger
in
her
grandfather
room
and
witness
his
slow
resurrection
without
a
secret
feeling
of
alarm
if
amidst
the
mute
rigidity
in
which
he
had
been
chained
by
paralysis
he
had
indeed
seen
heard
and
understood
everything
what
a
terrible
drama
must
have
filled
his
long
silence
for
more
than
thirty
years
he
had
remained
an
impassive
witness
as
it
were
of
the
decline
of
his
race
those
clear
eyes
of
his
had
beheld
the
rout
of
his
descendants
a
downfall
accelerated
from
father
to
son
by
the
vertigo
born
of
wealth
in
the
devouring
blaze
of
enjoyment
two
generations
had
sufficed
to
consume
the
fortune
which
his
father
and
he
had
built
up
and
which
he
had
deemed
so
firm
he
had
seen
his
son
michel
ruin
himself
for
worthless
women
directly
he
became
a
widower
and
blow
his
brains
out
with
a
whilst
his
daughter
laure
losing
her
head
in
mysticism
entered
a
convent
and
his
second
son
philippe
married
to
a
hussy
perished
in
a
duel
after
an
imbecile
career
he
had
also
seen
his
grandson
gustave
impel
his
father
michel
to
suicide
by
robbing
him
of
his
mistress
and
of
the
hundred
thousand
francs
that
he
had
collected
for
his
business
payments
whilst
at
the
same
time
his
other
grandson
andrÃ©
philippe
child
was
relegated
to
a
lunatic
asylum
he
had
further
seen
boisgelin
the
husband
of
his
granddaughter
suzanne
purchase
the
imperilled
abyss
and
confide
its
management
to
a
poor
cousin
delaveau
who
after
restoring
it
to
prosperity
for
a
brief
period
had
reduced
it
to
ashes
on
the
night
when
he
had
discovered
the
betrayal
of
his
wife
fernande
and
that
coxcomb
boisgelin
the
pair
of
them
maddened
by
such
a
craving
for
luxury
and
pleasure
that
they
had
destroyed
all
around
them
and
he
had
seen
the
abyss
his
work
so
small
and
modest
when
he
had
inherited
it
from
his
father
so
greatly
enlarged
by
himself
he
had
seen
that
abyss
which
he
had
hoped
his
race
would
make
a
city
the
empire
as
it
were
of
iron
and
steel
decline
so
rapidly
that
with
the
second
generation
of
his
descendants
not
a
stone
of
it
remained
standing
finally
he
had
seen
his
race
in
which
creative
power
had
accumulated
so
slowly
through
a
long
line
of
wretched
toilers
till
it
had
burst
forth
at
last
in
his
father
and
himself
he
had
seen
his
race
spoilt
debased
and
destroyed
by
the
abuse
of
wealth
as
if
nothing
of
the
qurignons
heroic
passion
for
work
glowed
among
his
grandchildren
and
thus
how
frightful
must
be
the
story
amassed
in
the
brain
of
that
octogenarian
what
a
procession
of
terrible
occurrences
synthetising
a
whole
century
of
effort
and
casting
light
on
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
of
a
family
and
what
a
terrifying
thing
too
it
was
that
the
brain
in
which
that
story
had
seemed
to
slumber
should
at
last
slowly
awaken
to
life
and
that
everything
should
threaten
to
come
forth
from
it
in
a
great
flood
of
truth
if
indeed
the
tongue
that
already
stammered
should
end
by
speaking
plainly
it
was
for
that
terrible
awakening
that
suzanne
now
waited
with
growing
anxiety
she
and
her
son
were
the
last
of
the
race
paul
was
the
sole
heir
of
the
qurignons
aunt
laure
had
lately
died
in
the
carmelite
convent
where
she
had
lived
for
nearly
forty
years
and
cousin
andrÃ©
cut
off
from
the
world
since
infancy
had
been
dead
for
many
years
already
thus
nowadays
whenever
paul
went
with
his
mother
into
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
room
the
old
man
eyes
once
more
gleaming
with
intelligence
rested
on
him
for
a
long
while
that
lad
was
the
sole
frail
wattle
of
the
oak
from
whose
powerful
trunk
he
had
once
hoped
to
see
a
number
of
vigorous
branches
a
whole
swarming
family
fork
and
grow
was
not
that
family
tree
full
of
new
sap
health
and
vigour
derived
from
sturdy
toiling
forerunners
would
not
his
line
blossom
forth
and
spread
around
to
conquer
all
the
wealth
and
all
the
joy
of
the
world
but
behold
the
sap
was
already
exhausted
with
the
coming
of
his
grandchildren
in
less
than
half
a
century
a
misspent
life
of
wealth
had
consumed
the
whole
strength
amassed
through
a
long
ancestry
how
bitter
it
was
when
that
unhappy
grandfather
the
supreme
witness
surviving
amidst
so
much
ruin
found
himself
confronted
by
one
sole
heir
that
gentle
delicate
refined
paul
who
was
like
the
last
gift
vouchsafed
by
life
which
perhaps
had
left
him
to
the
qurignons
in
order
that
they
might
grow
afresh
and
flower
in
new
soil
but
what
dolorous
irony
there
was
in
the
fact
that
only
that
quiet
thoughtful
lad
remained
in
that
huge
royal
residence
of
la
guerdache
which
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
had
originally
purchased
at
such
great
cost
in
the
hope
of
seeing
it
some
day
peopled
by
his
numerous
descendants
he
had
pictured
its
spacious
rooms
occupied
by
ten
households
he
had
imagined
that
he
could
hear
the
laughter
of
an
troop
of
boys
and
girls
in
his
imagination
the
place
became
the
happy
luxurious
family
estate
where
the
dynasty
of
the
qurignons
would
reign
but
on
the
contrary
the
rooms
had
grown
emptier
day
by
day
drunkenness
madness
and
death
had
swept
by
accomplishing
their
destructive
work
and
then
a
final
corrupting
creature
had
come
to
complete
the
ruin
of
the
house
and
since
the
last
catastrophe
of
the
rooms
were
kept
closed
the
whole
of
the
second
floor
was
abandoned
to
the
dust
and
even
the
were
only
opened
on
saturdays
in
order
to
admit
a
little
sunshine
the
race
would
end
if
paul
did
not
raise
it
up
afresh
the
empire
in
which
it
should
have
prospered
was
already
naught
but
a
large
empty
dwelling
which
would
crumble
away
in
abandonment
unless
new
life
were
imparted
to
it
another
week
went
by
the
servant
who
attended
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
could
now
distinguish
certain
words
amidst
his
stammering
at
last
a
distinct
phrase
was
detected
and
the
man
came
to
repeat
it
to
suzanne
he
did
not
manage
it
without
difficulty
madame
but
i
assure
you
that
this
morning
monsieur
repeated
one
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
suzanne
was
incredulous
the
words
seemed
to
have
no
meaning
what
was
to
be
given
back
must
listen
more
attentively
she
said
to
the
servant
to
distinguish
the
words
better
on
the
morrow
however
the
man
was
still
more
positive
assure
madame
said
he
monsieur
really
says
one
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
he
says
it
twenty
and
thirty
times
in
succession
in
a
low
but
persistent
voice
as
if
putting
all
his
strength
into
it
that
same
evening
suzanne
determined
to
watch
her
grandfather
herself
in
order
that
she
might
understand
things
better
on
the
following
day
the
old
man
was
unable
to
get
up
whilst
his
brain
seemed
to
be
freeing
itself
from
its
bonds
his
legs
and
soon
his
trunk
were
attacked
by
paralysis
and
became
quite
lifeless
suzanne
was
greatly
alarmed
by
this
and
again
sent
for
novarre
who
was
unable
to
do
anything
and
warned
her
that
the
end
was
approaching
from
that
moment
she
did
not
quit
the
room
it
was
a
very
large
room
with
very
thick
carpets
and
heavy
hangings
a
deep
ruddy
hue
and
a
substantial
and
rather
sombre
luxury
prevailed
there
the
furniture
was
of
carved
rosewood
the
bed
was
a
large
and
there
was
a
tall
mirror
in
which
the
park
was
reflected
when
the
windows
were
open
the
view
beyond
the
lawns
between
the
old
trees
stretched
over
an
immense
panorama
in
which
one
saw
first
the
jumbled
roofs
of
beauclair
and
then
the
bleuse
mountains
with
la
crÃªcherie
and
its
smeltery
and
the
abyss
whose
gigantic
chimneys
still
rose
erect
one
morning
suzanne
sat
down
near
the
bed
after
drawing
back
the
window
curtains
in
order
to
admit
the
winter
sunshine
and
all
at
once
she
felt
greatly
moved
on
hearing
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
speak
for
a
few
moments
his
face
had
been
turned
towards
one
of
the
windows
through
which
he
had
been
looking
at
the
distant
horizon
and
at
first
he
only
uttered
two
words
luc
suzanne
who
had
distinctly
heard
them
was
quite
overcome
with
surprise
why
monsieur
luc
her
grandfather
had
never
had
any
intercourse
with
luc
he
ought
to
have
been
ignorant
of
his
existence
unless
indeed
he
was
aware
of
what
had
lately
occurred
had
seen
everything
and
understood
everything
even
as
hitherto
she
had
only
suspected
and
feared
indeed
those
words
luc
falling
from
his
lips
which
had
been
sealed
so
long
were
like
a
first
proof
that
he
had
retained
a
lively
intelligence
amidst
his
silence
and
could
see
and
understand
suzanne
felt
her
anguish
increasing
it
really
monsieur
luc
that
you
say
grandfather
she
asked
yes
monsieur
luc
he
pronounced
the
name
with
increasing
distinctness
and
energy
keeping
his
ardent
glance
fixed
upon
her
why
do
you
speak
to
me
of
monsieur
luc
she
said
you
know
him
then
have
you
something
to
say
to
me
about
him
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
hesitated
doubtless
because
he
could
not
find
the
words
he
wished
then
with
childish
impatience
he
repeated
luc
used
to
be
my
best
friend
resumed
suzanne
for
long
years
now
he
has
ceased
coming
here
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
quickly
nodded
his
head
and
then
as
if
his
tongue
were
gradually
acquiring
the
power
of
speech
he
said
know
i
know
i
wish
him
to
come
wish
monsieur
luc
to
come
to
see
you
you
wish
to
speak
to
him
grandfather
yes
it
is
that
let
him
come
at
once
i
will
speak
to
him
the
surprise
and
the
vague
fright
that
possessed
suzanne
were
now
increasing
what
could
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
wish
to
say
to
luc
there
were
such
painful
possibilities
that
for
a
moment
she
tried
to
avoid
granting
the
old
man
request
as
if
indeed
she
imagined
him
to
be
delirious
but
he
was
in
full
possession
of
his
senses
and
entreated
her
with
increasing
fervour
all
the
strength
indeed
remaining
in
his
poor
infirm
frame
and
at
this
suzanne
felt
profoundly
disturbed
asking
herself
if
it
would
not
be
wrong
of
her
to
refuse
the
dying
man
request
for
that
interview
although
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
dimly
threatening
things
which
might
result
from
it
can
not
you
say
what
you
wish
to
me
grandfather
she
ultimately
asked
no
to
monsieur
luc
i
will
speak
to
him
at
once
oh
at
once
well
then
grandfather
i
will
write
to
him
and
i
hope
that
he
will
come
when
suzanne
sat
down
to
write
however
her
hand
trembled
she
penned
only
two
lines
friend
i
have
need
of
you
come
at
once
nevertheless
she
was
twice
compelled
to
pause
for
she
lacked
strength
to
trace
even
those
few
words
so
painful
were
the
memories
that
they
aroused
within
her
memories
of
her
lost
life
and
of
the
happiness
beside
which
she
had
passed
and
which
she
would
never
know
at
last
however
the
note
was
written
and
it
was
scarcely
ten
in
the
morning
when
one
of
the
servants
a
lad
set
out
to
take
it
to
la
crÃªcherie
luc
as
it
happened
was
standing
outside
the
finishing
his
morning
inspection
when
the
note
was
handed
to
him
and
without
delay
he
followed
the
young
messenger
but
how
great
was
the
emotion
which
he
felt
on
reading
those
simple
yet
touching
words
friend
i
have
need
of
you
come
at
once
events
had
parted
him
from
suzanne
for
twelve
long
years
yet
she
wrote
to
him
as
if
they
had
met
only
the
previous
day
like
one
too
who
was
certain
that
he
would
respond
to
her
appeal
she
had
not
doubted
his
friendship
for
a
moment
and
he
was
touched
to
tears
at
finding
her
ever
the
same
still
full
of
sisterly
affection
as
in
former
times
the
most
frightful
tragedies
had
burst
forth
around
them
every
passion
had
run
riot
sweeping
away
men
and
things
yet
after
those
years
of
separation
they
found
themselves
hand
in
hand
once
more
whilst
walking
on
quickly
and
drawing
near
to
la
guerdache
luc
began
to
wonder
however
why
she
had
sent
for
him
he
was
not
ignorant
of
boisgelin
desire
to
speculate
on
the
situation
and
sell
the
abyss
for
as
much
money
as
possible
but
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
never
buy
it
the
only
acceptable
solution
of
the
matter
in
his
opinion
was
the
entry
of
the
abyss
into
the
association
of
la
crÃªcherie
after
the
fashion
of
the
other
smaller
factories
for
a
moment
it
occurred
to
him
that
boisgelin
might
have
asked
his
wife
to
make
overtures
to
him
but
he
knew
her
and
felt
that
she
was
incapable
of
playing
such
a
part
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
must
be
exhausted
by
some
great
anxiety
that
she
must
need
his
help
in
some
tragic
circumstance
and
so
he
puzzled
his
mind
no
more
she
herself
would
soon
tell
him
what
service
she
required
of
his
affection
suzanne
was
waiting
for
him
in
one
of
the
little
and
when
luc
entered
it
she
thought
she
was
about
to
faint
so
great
became
her
perturbation
he
himself
felt
upset
and
at
first
neither
of
them
could
utter
a
word
they
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
my
friend
my
friend
suzanne
murmured
when
she
was
at
last
able
to
speak
those
simple
words
were
fraught
with
all
the
emotion
she
felt
at
the
thought
of
those
last
twelve
years
their
separation
broken
only
by
a
few
silent
chance
meetings
the
cruel
life
which
she
herself
had
led
in
her
defiled
home
and
the
work
which
he
meantime
had
accomplished
and
which
she
had
watched
from
afar
enthusiastically
he
had
become
a
hero
for
her
she
had
worshipped
him
and
had
longed
to
throw
herself
at
his
knees
nurse
his
wounds
and
become
his
consoling
helpmate
but
another
had
stepped
between
them
josine
who
had
caused
her
so
much
suffering
that
now
all
passionate
love
seemed
dead
nevertheless
at
the
sight
of
luc
standing
once
more
before
her
all
those
hidden
things
rose
from
the
depths
of
her
being
and
the
intensity
of
her
emotion
moistened
her
eyes
and
made
her
hands
quiver
my
friend
my
friend
she
repeated
it
was
sufficient
that
i
should
send
for
you
luc
quivered
with
a
similar
sympathy
and
he
also
recalled
the
past
he
knew
how
unhappily
she
had
lived
beneath
the
horrible
insult
offered
to
her
the
presence
of
her
husband
mistress
in
her
home
he
knew
too
what
dignity
and
heroism
she
had
shown
in
remaining
in
that
home
with
head
erect
for
her
son
sake
and
her
own
thus
in
spite
of
separation
she
had
never
been
absent
from
his
mind
and
heart
he
had
pitied
her
more
and
more
at
each
fresh
trial
that
fell
upon
her
he
had
often
wondered
how
he
might
help
her
it
would
have
greatly
delighted
him
to
be
able
to
prove
that
he
had
forgotten
nothing
that
he
was
still
the
same
good
friend
as
formerly
and
this
was
why
he
had
now
hastened
to
respond
to
her
first
summons
full
of
an
anxious
affection
which
made
his
heart
swell
and
prevented
him
from
speaking
at
last
however
he
was
able
to
reply
your
friend
one
who
has
never
ceased
to
be
so
and
who
only
awaited
your
summons
to
hasten
here
they
were
at
that
moment
so
keenly
conscious
of
the
bond
that
for
ever
united
them
like
brother
and
sister
that
they
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
on
the
cheeks
even
as
friends
who
fear
nought
of
human
folly
or
suffering
but
are
certain
that
they
will
only
impart
peacefulness
and
courage
to
one
another
all
the
strength
and
tenderness
with
which
the
friendship
of
man
and
woman
may
be
instinct
bloomed
in
their
smiles
you
only
knew
my
friend
said
luc
great
my
fears
were
when
i
realised
that
my
competition
would
end
by
destroying
the
abyss
was
it
not
you
whom
i
was
ruining
and
what
faith
in
my
work
i
needed
to
prevent
those
thoughts
from
staying
my
hand
great
sorrow
often
came
upon
me
i
believed
that
you
must
curse
me
that
you
would
never
forgive
me
for
being
the
cause
of
the
worries
in
which
you
must
be
struggling
you
my
friend
but
i
was
with
you
i
prayed
for
you
your
victories
were
my
only
joy
and
living
in
a
sphere
that
hated
you
it
was
very
sweet
for
me
to
have
a
secret
affection
to
be
able
to
understand
and
love
you
unknown
to
everybody
the
less
i
have
ruined
you
my
friend
luc
retorted
will
become
of
you
now
accustomed
as
you
have
been
since
childhood
to
a
life
of
luxury
ruined
that
would
have
come
about
without
you
it
was
the
others
who
ruined
me
and
you
will
see
how
brave
i
can
be
no
matter
how
delicate
you
may
think
me
paul
your
son
why
nothing
happier
could
have
befallen
him
he
will
work
you
know
what
wealth
has
done
to
my
people
then
suzanne
at
last
told
luc
why
she
had
sent
him
such
a
pressing
summons
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
the
wondrous
awakening
of
whose
intelligence
she
revealed
wished
to
speak
to
him
it
was
the
desire
of
a
dying
man
for
doctor
novarre
believed
in
his
imminent
dissolution
astonished
by
these
tidings
even
as
she
had
been
seized
too
like
herself
with
vague
alarm
at
the
thought
of
this
resurrection
in
which
he
was
so
strangely
desired
to
intervene
luc
none
the
less
answered
that
he
was
entirely
at
her
disposal
and
ready
to
do
whatever
she
might
request
you
warned
your
husband
of
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
desire
and
my
visit
he
inquired
suzanne
looked
at
him
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
did
not
think
of
it
besides
it
is
useless
said
she
a
long
time
past
it
has
seemed
as
if
my
grandfather
no
longer
knew
that
my
husband
existed
he
does
not
speak
to
him
he
does
not
even
seem
to
see
him
moreover
my
husband
went
out
shooting
early
this
morning
and
he
has
not
yet
come
home
then
she
added
you
will
follow
me
i
will
take
you
to
my
grandfather
at
once
when
they
entered
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
room
the
old
man
who
was
sitting
up
in
the
large
rosewood
bed
supported
by
several
pillows
still
had
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
window
whose
curtains
had
been
drawn
back
in
all
probability
he
had
never
ceased
gazing
over
the
park
and
the
spreading
horizon
with
the
abyss
and
la
crÃªcherie
showing
yonder
beside
the
bleuse
mountains
above
the
jumbled
roofs
of
beauclair
it
was
a
scene
which
seemed
to
attract
him
irresistibly
like
some
symbolism
of
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
which
he
had
had
before
him
during
all
his
long
silent
years
said
suzanne
have
had
monsieur
luc
froment
fetched
for
you
here
he
is
he
was
kind
enough
to
come
at
once
the
old
man
slowly
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
luc
with
his
large
eyes
which
had
grown
it
seemed
yet
larger
than
formerly
and
which
were
now
full
of
deep
light
he
said
nothing
no
word
of
greeting
or
thanks
came
from
his
lips
and
the
heavy
silence
lasted
several
minutes
whilst
he
kept
his
gaze
fixed
upon
that
stranger
the
founder
of
la
crÃªcherie
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
know
him
thoroughly
to
dive
indeed
into
his
very
soul
at
last
suzanne
who
felt
slightly
embarrassed
resumed
do
not
know
monsieur
froment
grandfather
but
perhaps
you
may
have
noticed
him
when
you
were
out
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
did
not
appear
to
hear
his
granddaughter
for
he
still
returned
no
answer
after
a
moment
however
he
once
more
turned
his
head
and
looked
round
the
room
and
failing
to
find
what
he
sought
he
ended
by
speaking
one
word
a
name
this
caused
suzanne
fresh
astonishment
as
well
as
anxiety
and
embarrassment
are
asking
for
my
husband
grandfather
do
you
wish
him
to
come
here
she
inquired
yes
boisgelin
i
am
afraid
that
he
has
not
come
home
yet
meantime
you
ought
to
tell
monsieur
froment
why
you
wished
to
see
him
no
boisgelin
boisgelin
it
was
evident
that
he
wished
to
speak
in
boisgelin
presence
suzanne
therefore
apologised
to
luc
and
left
the
room
to
seek
her
husband
meanwhile
luc
remained
face
to
face
with
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
conscious
that
the
latter
bright
glance
was
still
and
ever
fixed
upon
him
in
his
turn
he
then
began
to
scrutinise
the
old
man
and
found
him
looking
wondrously
handsome
in
his
extreme
old
age
with
his
white
face
and
regular
features
to
which
the
approach
of
death
seemed
to
impart
an
expression
of
sovereign
majesty
the
wait
was
a
long
one
and
not
a
word
was
exchanged
by
those
two
men
whose
eyes
dived
into
one
another
all
around
them
the
room
with
its
heavy
hangings
and
massive
furniture
seemed
to
be
slumbering
not
a
sound
arose
there
was
naught
but
the
quiver
which
came
through
the
walls
from
the
large
empty
closed
rooms
the
stories
and
stories
which
had
been
abandoned
to
dust
and
nothing
could
have
been
more
tragical
or
solemn
than
that
spell
of
silent
waiting
at
last
suzanne
returned
bringing
with
her
boisgelin
who
had
just
come
home
he
still
wore
his
gloves
and
gaiters
for
she
had
not
allowed
him
time
to
change
his
clothes
and
he
came
in
with
an
anxious
bewildered
air
astonished
at
such
an
adventure
all
that
his
wife
had
just
rapidly
told
him
of
the
summoning
of
luc
his
presence
in
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
room
the
old
recovery
of
his
intelligence
and
the
statement
that
he
was
awaiting
him
boisgelin
before
speaking
all
those
unforeseen
occurrences
quite
upset
suzanne
husband
who
had
not
been
allowed
even
a
few
minutes
of
reflection
grandfather
said
suzanne
is
my
husband
speak
if
you
have
something
to
tell
us
we
are
listening
but
again
the
old
man
looked
round
the
room
and
once
more
he
asked
where
is
paul
you
want
paul
to
be
here
too
yes
i
want
him
the
fact
is
that
he
must
be
at
the
farm
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
will
be
necessary
to
fetch
him
must
come
i
want
him
i
want
him
suzanne
yielded
and
hastily
despatched
a
servant
for
her
son
and
then
the
waiting
began
afresh
and
proved
even
more
solemn
and
tragic
than
before
luc
and
boisgelin
had
simply
bowed
to
one
another
finding
nothing
to
say
on
meeting
after
so
many
years
in
that
room
which
an
august
breath
already
seemed
to
fill
nobody
spoke
and
amidst
the
quiver
of
the
air
one
only
heard
the
somewhat
heavy
respiration
of
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
once
again
his
large
eyes
full
of
light
were
turned
towards
the
window
towards
that
horizon
symbolical
of
the
labour
of
manhood
where
the
past
had
undergone
accomplishment
and
where
the
future
would
be
born
and
the
minutes
went
by
slowly
regularly
in
that
anxious
wait
for
what
was
to
come
the
act
of
sovereign
grandeur
whose
approach
could
be
divined
some
light
footsteps
were
heard
at
last
and
paul
came
in
his
face
glowing
healthily
from
contact
with
the
open
air
boy
said
suzanne
is
your
grandfather
who
has
brought
us
all
together
here
he
wishes
you
to
be
present
while
he
speaks
on
the
hitherto
rigid
lips
of
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
a
smile
of
infinite
tenderness
had
at
last
appeared
he
signed
to
paul
to
approach
and
made
him
sit
down
as
near
as
possible
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
it
was
particularly
for
him
the
last
heir
of
the
qurignons
through
whom
the
race
might
flower
anew
and
yet
yield
excellent
fruit
that
he
desired
to
speak
and
on
seeing
how
moved
the
youth
looked
full
of
grief
at
the
thought
of
a
last
farewell
he
continued
for
a
moment
trying
to
reassure
him
with
his
affectionate
glances
like
one
to
whom
death
was
sweet
since
he
was
about
to
bequeath
as
inheritance
to
his
an
act
of
goodness
justice
and
pacification
at
last
he
began
to
speak
amidst
the
religious
silence
of
one
and
all
he
had
turned
his
face
towards
boisgelin
and
at
first
he
merely
repeated
the
words
which
his
servant
had
for
two
days
past
heard
him
stammering
in
an
undertone
amidst
other
confused
utterances
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
then
seeing
that
the
others
did
not
appear
to
understand
what
he
meant
he
turned
to
paul
and
repeated
with
growing
energy
must
give
back
my
child
give
back
suzanne
shuddered
and
exchanged
a
glance
with
luc
who
also
was
quivering
whilst
boisgelin
seized
with
uneasiness
and
alarm
pretended
to
detect
in
all
this
some
rambling
on
the
old
man
part
but
suzanne
inquired
do
you
desire
to
tell
us
grandfather
what
is
it
that
we
must
give
back
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
speech
was
fast
becoming
easier
and
more
distinct
my
child
the
abyss
yonder
must
be
given
back
la
guerdache
must
be
given
back
one
must
give
back
the
land
of
the
farm
everything
must
be
given
because
nothing
ought
to
belong
to
us
because
everything
ought
to
belong
to
all
explain
to
us
grandfather
to
whom
are
we
to
give
these
things
tell
you
my
girl
they
must
be
given
back
to
all
nothing
of
what
we
thought
to
be
our
property
belongs
to
us
if
that
property
has
poisoned
and
destroyed
us
it
is
because
it
belonged
to
others
for
our
happiness
and
the
happiness
of
all
it
must
be
given
back
given
back
then
came
a
scene
of
sovereign
beauty
incomparable
grandeur
the
old
man
did
not
always
find
the
words
he
desired
but
his
gestures
indicated
his
meaning
amidst
the
silence
of
those
who
surrounded
him
he
went
on
slowly
and
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
succeeded
in
making
himself
understood
he
had
seen
everything
heard
everything
understood
everything
and
even
as
suzanne
had
divined
with
quivering
anguish
it
was
all
the
past
which
now
came
back
all
the
truth
of
the
terrible
past
pouring
forth
in
a
flood
from
that
hitherto
silent
impassive
witness
so
long
imprisoned
within
his
own
body
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
only
survived
the
many
disasters
a
whole
family
of
happy
then
stricken
beings
in
order
to
draw
from
everything
the
great
lesson
on
the
day
of
awakening
before
going
to
his
death
he
spread
out
all
the
torture
he
had
suffered
as
one
who
after
believing
in
the
triumphant
reign
of
his
race
over
an
empire
established
by
himself
had
lived
long
enough
to
see
both
race
and
empire
swept
away
by
the
blast
of
the
future
and
he
told
why
all
this
had
happened
he
judged
it
and
offered
reparation
at
the
outset
came
the
first
qurignon
the
drawer
who
with
a
few
mates
had
founded
the
abyss
he
being
as
poor
as
they
were
but
probably
more
skilful
and
economical
then
came
himself
the
second
qurignon
the
one
who
had
gained
a
fortune
and
piled
up
millions
in
the
course
of
a
stubborn
struggle
in
which
he
had
displayed
heroic
determination
ceaseless
and
energy
but
if
he
had
accomplished
prodigies
of
activity
and
creative
genius
if
he
had
gained
money
thanks
to
his
skill
in
adapting
the
conditions
of
production
to
those
of
sale
he
knew
very
well
that
he
was
simply
the
outcome
of
long
generations
of
toilers
from
whom
he
had
derived
all
his
strength
and
triumph
how
many
peasants
perspiring
as
they
tilled
the
glebe
how
many
workmen
exhausted
by
the
handling
of
tools
had
been
required
for
the
advent
of
those
two
first
qurignons
who
had
conquered
fortune
among
those
forerunners
there
had
been
a
keen
passion
to
fight
for
life
to
make
money
to
rise
from
one
class
to
another
to
pursue
all
the
slow
enfranchisement
of
the
poor
wretch
who
bends
in
servitude
over
his
appointed
task
and
at
last
one
qurignon
had
been
strong
enough
to
conquer
to
escape
from
the
gaol
of
poverty
to
acquire
the
wealth
and
become
in
his
turn
a
rich
man
a
master
but
immediately
afterwards
that
is
in
two
generations
his
descendants
collapsed
fell
once
more
into
the
dolorous
struggle
for
existence
exhausted
already
as
they
were
by
enjoyment
consumed
by
it
as
by
a
flame
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
repeated
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
there
was
his
son
michel
who
after
years
of
excesses
had
killed
himself
on
the
eve
of
a
there
was
his
other
son
philippe
who
having
married
a
hussy
had
been
ruined
by
her
and
had
lost
his
life
in
a
foolish
duel
there
was
his
daughter
laure
who
had
died
in
a
convent
her
mind
weakened
by
mystical
visions
there
were
his
two
grandsons
andrÃ©
a
rachitic
who
had
passed
away
in
an
asylum
and
gustave
who
had
met
a
tragic
death
in
italy
after
impelling
his
father
to
suicide
by
robbing
him
of
his
mistress
and
the
money
he
needed
for
his
business
payments
finally
there
was
his
granddaughter
suzanne
the
sensible
creature
whose
husband
after
repurchasing
the
abyss
and
la
guerdache
had
completed
the
work
of
destruction
the
abyss
was
now
in
ashes
and
la
guerdache
where
he
had
hoped
to
see
his
race
swarming
had
become
a
desert
and
whilst
his
race
had
been
collapsing
carrying
off
both
his
father
work
and
his
own
he
had
seen
another
work
arise
la
crÃªcherie
which
was
now
full
of
prosperity
throbbing
with
the
future
that
it
brought
with
it
he
knew
all
those
things
because
his
clear
eyes
had
witnessed
them
in
the
course
of
his
daily
outings
those
hours
of
silent
contemplation
when
he
had
found
himself
outside
the
abyss
at
the
moment
when
one
or
another
shift
was
leaving
or
outside
la
crÃªcherie
where
the
men
who
had
deserted
his
own
foundation
took
off
their
caps
to
him
and
again
he
had
passed
before
the
abyss
on
the
morning
when
of
that
creation
he
had
found
nought
but
smoking
ruins
left
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
that
cry
which
he
constantly
repeated
amidst
his
slowly
flowing
words
which
he
emphasised
each
time
with
more
and
more
energy
ascended
from
his
heart
like
the
natural
consequence
of
all
the
disastrous
events
which
had
caused
him
so
much
suffering
if
everything
around
him
had
crumbled
away
so
soon
was
it
not
because
the
fortune
which
he
had
acquired
by
the
labour
of
others
was
both
poisoned
and
poisonous
the
enjoyment
that
such
fortune
brings
is
the
most
certain
of
destructive
ferments
it
bastardises
a
race
disorganises
a
family
leads
to
abominable
tragedies
in
less
than
half
a
century
it
had
consumed
the
strength
the
intelligence
the
genius
which
the
qurignons
had
amassed
during
several
centuries
of
rough
toil
the
mistake
of
those
robust
workers
had
been
their
belief
that
to
secure
personal
happiness
they
ought
to
appropriate
and
enjoy
the
wealth
created
by
the
exertions
of
their
companions
and
the
wealth
they
had
dreamt
of
the
wealth
they
had
acquired
had
proved
their
chastisement
nothing
can
be
worse
from
the
moral
point
of
view
than
to
cite
as
an
example
the
workman
who
grows
rich
who
becomes
an
employer
the
sovereign
master
of
thousands
of
his
who
bend
perspiring
over
their
toil
producing
the
wealth
by
which
he
triumphs
when
a
writer
says
see
very
well
that
with
order
and
intelligence
a
mere
blacksmith
may
attain
to
everything
he
simply
contributes
to
the
work
of
iniquity
and
aggravates
social
disequilibrium
the
happiness
of
the
elect
is
really
compounded
of
the
unhappiness
of
others
for
it
is
their
happiness
which
he
cuts
down
and
purloins
the
comrade
who
makes
his
way
as
the
saying
goes
bars
the
road
to
thousands
of
other
comrades
lives
upon
their
misery
and
their
suffering
and
it
often
happens
that
the
happy
one
is
punished
by
success
by
fortune
itself
which
coming
too
quickly
and
disproportionately
proves
murderous
this
is
why
the
only
right
course
is
to
revert
to
salutary
work
work
on
the
part
of
all
all
earning
their
livings
and
owing
their
happiness
solely
to
the
exertion
of
their
minds
and
their
muscles
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
repeated
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
one
must
give
back
indeed
one
must
restitute
because
one
is
liable
to
die
of
that
which
one
steals
from
another
one
must
give
back
because
the
sole
cure
the
only
certainty
of
happiness
lies
in
doing
so
one
must
give
back
in
a
spirit
of
justice
and
even
more
in
own
personal
interest
since
the
happiness
of
each
can
only
reside
in
the
happiness
of
all
one
must
give
back
in
order
that
one
may
enjoy
better
health
and
live
a
happy
life
in
the
midst
of
universal
peace
one
must
give
back
because
if
all
the
unjust
victors
of
life
all
the
egotistical
holders
of
the
public
fortune
were
to
restore
the
wealth
that
they
squander
for
their
personal
pleasures
the
great
estates
the
great
industrial
enterprises
the
roads
the
towns
peace
would
be
restored
love
would
flower
once
more
among
men
and
there
would
be
such
an
abundance
of
possessions
that
not
one
single
being
would
be
left
in
penury
one
must
give
back
because
one
must
set
the
example
if
one
desires
that
other
wealthy
folk
may
understand
may
realise
whence
have
come
all
the
evils
from
which
they
suffer
and
may
be
inspired
to
endow
their
descendants
with
renewed
vigour
by
plunging
them
once
more
into
active
life
daily
work
one
must
give
back
too
whilst
there
is
yet
time
to
do
so
whilst
there
is
still
some
nobility
in
returning
to
one
comrades
in
showing
them
that
one
was
mistaken
and
that
one
returns
to
one
place
in
the
ranks
to
participate
in
the
common
effort
with
the
hope
that
the
hour
of
justice
and
peace
will
soon
strike
and
one
must
give
back
in
order
to
die
with
a
clear
conscience
a
heart
joyful
at
having
accomplished
one
duty
at
leaving
a
repairing
and
liberating
lesson
to
the
last
of
one
race
so
that
he
may
restore
it
save
it
from
error
and
perpetuate
it
in
strength
delight
and
beauty
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
tears
had
appeared
in
suzanne
eyes
as
she
perceived
the
exaltation
with
which
her
son
paul
was
filled
by
her
grandfather
words
whilst
boisgelin
expressed
his
irritation
by
impatient
movements
grandfather
said
she
whom
and
how
are
we
to
give
back
the
old
man
turned
his
bright
eyes
upon
luc
i
desired
the
founder
of
la
crÃªcherie
to
be
present
said
he
was
in
order
that
he
might
hear
me
and
help
you
my
children
he
has
already
done
much
for
the
work
of
reparation
he
alone
can
intervene
and
restore
what
remains
of
our
fortune
to
the
sons
and
grandsons
of
those
who
were
my
own
and
my
father
comrades
luc
was
filled
with
emotion
by
the
wondrous
nobility
of
the
scene
yet
he
hesitated
for
he
could
divine
boisgelin
keen
hostility
can
only
do
one
thing
said
he
is
if
the
owners
of
the
abyss
are
willing
i
will
procure
them
admission
into
our
association
at
la
crÃªcherie
in
the
same
way
as
other
factories
have
already
done
the
abyss
will
increase
our
family
double
in
fact
the
importance
of
our
growing
town
if
by
back
you
mean
a
return
to
increase
of
justice
a
step
towards
the
absolute
justice
of
the
future
i
will
help
you
i
will
consent
to
what
you
say
with
all
my
heart
know
you
will
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
slowly
answered
ask
nothing
more
but
boisgelin
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
began
to
protest
that
is
not
what
i
desire
however
much
it
may
distress
me
to
do
so
i
am
willing
to
sell
the
abyss
to
la
crÃªcherie
a
price
will
have
to
be
agreed
upon
and
in
addition
to
the
amount
which
may
be
fixed
i
desire
to
retain
an
interest
in
the
enterprise
which
also
will
have
to
be
arranged
i
need
money
and
i
wish
to
sell
this
was
the
plan
which
he
had
been
maturing
for
some
days
past
in
the
idea
that
luc
was
eager
to
secure
possession
of
the
abyss
land
and
that
he
would
be
able
to
obtain
a
considerable
sum
from
him
at
once
as
well
as
a
future
income
but
this
plan
entirely
collapsed
when
luc
declared
in
a
voice
expressive
of
irrevocable
determination
is
impossible
for
us
to
buy
it
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
which
guides
us
we
are
simply
an
association
a
family
open
to
all
those
brothers
who
may
wish
to
join
us
then
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
whose
bright
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
boisgelin
resumed
with
sovereign
tranquillity
of
manner
is
i
who
wish
it
and
who
order
it
my
granddaughter
suzanne
here
present
is
of
the
abyss
and
she
will
refuse
her
consent
to
any
other
arrangement
than
that
which
i
desire
and
like
myself
i
am
sure
that
she
will
have
but
one
regret
that
of
being
unable
to
restore
everything
of
having
to
accept
interest
on
her
capital
which
she
will
dispose
of
as
her
heart
may
dictate
and
as
boisgelin
remained
silent
submitting
to
the
others
with
the
weakness
that
had
come
with
his
ruin
the
old
man
continued
that
is
not
all
there
remain
la
guerdache
and
the
farm
they
must
be
given
back
given
back
then
though
he
was
again
experiencing
a
difficulty
in
speaking
and
was
exhausted
he
made
his
last
desires
known
as
the
abyss
would
be
blended
with
la
crÃªcherie
he
wished
the
farm
to
join
the
association
of
les
combettes
so
as
to
enlarge
the
fields
which
had
been
united
by
lenfant
yvonnot
and
all
the
other
peasants
who
had
been
living
together
like
brothers
since
a
proper
understanding
of
their
interests
had
reconciled
them
there
would
be
but
one
stretch
of
earth
one
common
mother
loved
by
all
tilled
by
all
and
feeding
all
the
whole
plain
of
la
roumagne
would
end
by
yielding
one
vast
harvest
to
fill
the
granaries
of
regenerated
beauclair
and
as
for
la
guerdache
which
entirely
belonged
to
suzanne
he
charged
her
to
restore
it
to
the
poor
and
suffering
so
that
she
might
keep
nothing
of
the
property
which
had
poisoned
the
qurignons
then
reverting
to
paul
who
still
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
taking
his
hand
in
his
own
and
looking
at
him
earnestly
with
his
eyes
which
were
now
growing
dim
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
said
in
a
lower
and
lower
voice
must
give
back
one
must
give
back
my
child
you
will
keep
nothing
you
will
give
yonder
park
to
the
old
comrades
so
that
they
may
rejoice
there
on
high
days
and
so
that
their
wives
and
children
may
walk
there
and
enjoy
hours
of
gaiety
and
good
health
under
the
fine
trees
and
you
will
also
give
back
this
house
this
huge
residence
which
we
did
not
know
how
to
fill
in
spite
of
all
our
money
for
i
wish
it
to
belong
to
the
wives
and
the
children
of
poor
workmen
they
will
be
welcomed
here
and
nursed
when
they
are
ailing
or
when
they
are
weary
keep
nothing
give
all
all
back
my
child
if
you
wish
to
save
yourself
from
poison
and
work
and
live
solely
on
the
fruits
of
your
work
and
seek
out
the
daughter
of
some
old
comrade
who
still
works
and
marry
her
so
that
she
may
bring
you
handsome
children
who
also
will
work
who
will
be
just
and
happy
beings
and
in
their
turn
have
handsome
children
for
the
eternal
work
of
futurity
keep
nothing
my
child
give
everything
back
for
therein
alone
lies
salvation
peace
and
joy
they
were
all
weeping
now
never
had
a
more
beautiful
a
loftier
a
more
heroic
breath
passed
over
human
souls
the
great
room
had
become
august
and
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
which
had
filled
it
with
light
faded
slowly
whilst
his
voice
likewise
became
fainter
returning
to
eternal
silence
he
had
at
last
accomplished
his
sublime
work
of
reparation
truth
and
justice
to
help
on
the
advent
of
the
happiness
which
is
the
primordial
right
of
every
man
and
his
duty
done
that
same
evening
he
died
before
then
however
when
suzanne
and
luc
left
monsieur
room
together
they
found
themselves
alone
for
a
moment
in
the
little
they
were
so
overcome
by
emotion
that
their
hearts
rose
to
their
lips
on
me
said
luc
swear
to
you
that
i
will
watch
over
the
fulfilment
of
the
supreme
desires
which
have
been
committed
to
you
i
will
attend
to
matters
from
this
moment
she
had
taken
hold
of
his
hands
my
friend
she
answered
place
my
faith
in
you
i
know
what
miracles
you
have
already
performed
and
i
do
not
doubt
the
prodigy
which
you
will
accomplish
by
reconciling
us
all
ah
there
is
nothing
but
love
ah
if
i
had
only
been
loved
as
i
myself
loved
she
was
trembling
the
secret
of
which
she
herself
had
been
ignorant
so
long
escaped
her
at
that
solemn
moment
friend
my
friend
she
repeated
strength
i
should
have
had
for
doing
good
what
help
might
i
not
have
given
had
i
felt
beside
me
the
arm
of
a
just
man
a
hero
one
whom
i
should
have
made
my
god
but
if
it
be
too
late
for
that
will
you
at
least
accept
what
help
i
may
be
able
to
give
as
a
friend
a
sister
he
understood
her
it
was
a
repetition
of
sÅurette
sweet
sad
case
she
had
loved
him
without
revealing
it
without
even
owning
it
to
herself
like
an
honest
woman
eager
for
tenderness
who
amidst
the
torments
of
her
household
dreamt
of
happy
love
and
now
that
josine
was
chosen
now
that
all
else
was
dead
without
possibility
of
resurrection
she
gave
herself
even
as
sÅurette
had
done
as
a
sisterly
companion
a
devoted
friend
who
longed
to
participate
in
his
mission
i
will
accept
your
help
cried
luc
who
was
touched
to
tears
yes
indeed
there
is
never
enough
affection
enough
help
and
active
tenderness
the
work
is
vast
and
you
will
have
ample
opportunities
for
giving
without
stint
your
heart
come
with
us
my
friend
and
stay
with
us
and
you
will
be
part
of
my
thoughts
and
my
love
she
was
transported
by
his
words
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
they
kissed
an
indissoluble
bond
was
being
formed
between
them
a
marriage
of
sentiment
of
exquisite
purity
in
which
there
was
nought
but
a
common
passion
for
the
poor
and
the
suffering
an
inextinguishable
desire
to
obliterate
the
misery
of
the
world
months
went
by
and
the
liquidation
of
the
affairs
of
the
abyss
which
were
extremely
involved
proved
a
most
laborious
matter
before
everything
else
it
was
necessary
to
get
rid
of
the
debt
of
six
hundred
thousand
francs
arrangements
were
at
last
entered
into
with
the
creditors
who
agreed
to
accept
payment
in
annuities
levied
upon
the
share
of
profits
to
which
the
abyss
would
be
entitled
when
it
entered
the
crÃªcherie
association
then
it
was
necessary
to
value
the
plant
and
materials
saved
from
the
fire
these
with
all
the
land
stretching
along
the
mionne
as
far
as
old
beauclair
formed
the
share
of
capital
which
the
boisgelins
brought
into
the
association
and
a
modest
income
levied
on
the
profits
before
they
were
divided
among
the
creditors
was
ensured
them
old
qurignon
desires
were
but
half
fulfilled
during
that
period
of
transition
when
capital
still
held
a
position
similar
to
that
of
work
and
intelligence
pending
the
time
when
with
the
victory
of
sovereign
work
it
would
altogether
disappear
at
least
however
la
guerdache
and
the
farm
returned
completely
to
the
commonalty
the
heirs
of
the
toilers
who
had
formerly
paid
for
them
with
the
sweat
of
their
brows
for
as
soon
as
the
farm
lands
entering
the
combettes
association
in
accordance
with
the
schemes
of
feuillat
began
to
prosper
and
yield
gain
the
whole
of
the
money
was
employed
to
transform
la
guerdache
into
a
convalescent
home
for
weak
children
and
women
who
had
recently
become
mothers
free
beds
were
installed
there
with
gratuitous
board
and
the
park
now
belonged
to
the
humble
ones
of
the
world
forming
a
huge
garden
a
paradise
as
of
dreamland
where
children
played
where
mothers
recovered
their
health
where
the
multitude
enjoyed
recreation
as
in
some
palace
of
nature
which
had
become
the
palace
of
one
and
all
years
went
by
luc
had
ceded
one
of
the
little
houses
of
la
crÃªcherie
near
the
pavilion
which
he
still
occupied
to
the
boisgelins
and
at
first
that
modest
life
proved
very
hard
for
boisgelin
who
did
not
become
resigned
to
it
without
violent
fits
of
revolt
at
one
moment
he
even
wished
to
go
to
paris
to
live
there
chancewise
as
he
listed
but
his
innate
sloth
and
the
impossibility
of
earning
his
own
living
rendered
him
as
weak
as
a
child
and
placed
him
in
the
hands
of
whoever
cared
to
take
him
since
his
downfall
suzanne
so
sensible
so
gentle
and
yet
so
firm
had
acquired
absolute
authority
over
him
and
he
always
ended
by
doing
what
she
wished
like
a
poor
rudderless
creature
carried
away
by
the
stream
of
life
soon
too
among
that
active
world
of
workers
he
felt
idleness
weighing
upon
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
began
to
desire
some
occupation
he
felt
weary
of
dragging
himself
about
all
day
long
he
suffered
from
a
secret
feeling
of
shame
a
need
of
action
for
he
could
no
longer
tire
himself
with
the
management
and
squandering
of
a
large
fortune
shooting
remained
a
resource
for
him
during
the
winter
months
but
as
soon
as
the
fine
weather
came
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
except
to
ride
out
occasionally
and
dismal
then
crushed
him
down
and
so
when
suzanne
prevailed
on
luc
to
confide
an
inspectorship
to
him
a
kind
of
control
over
a
department
of
the
general
stores
which
meant
employment
for
three
hours
of
his
time
every
day
he
ended
by
accepting
the
offer
his
health
which
had
suffered
then
improved
still
he
always
displayed
anxiety
wearing
a
lost
unhappy
air
such
as
one
might
find
in
a
man
who
had
fallen
from
one
planet
to
another
and
years
again
went
by
suzanne
had
become
the
friend
and
sister
of
josine
and
sÅurette
in
whose
work
she
participated
all
three
surrounded
luc
sustaining
him
and
completing
him
like
personifications
of
kindness
love
and
gentleness
he
called
them
with
a
smile
his
three
virtues
they
busied
themselves
with
the
the
schools
the
infirmaries
and
the
convalescent
homes
they
went
wherever
there
might
be
weakness
to
protect
pain
to
assuage
joy
to
initiate
sÅurette
and
suzanne
in
particular
took
on
themselves
the
most
ungrateful
tasks
those
which
require
personal
abnegation
entire
renunciation
whilst
josine
having
to
attend
to
her
children
her
home
naturally
bestowed
less
of
her
time
upon
others
she
moreover
was
the
the
flower
of
beauty
and
desire
whilst
sÅurette
and
suzanne
were
the
friends
the
consolers
and
the
counsellors
at
times
some
very
bitter
trials
still
fell
on
luc
and
often
on
quitting
his
wife
embrace
it
was
to
his
two
friends
that
he
listened
charging
them
to
dress
the
wounds
they
spoke
of
and
devote
themselves
to
the
common
work
of
salvation
it
was
by
and
for
women
that
the
future
city
had
to
be
founded
eight
years
had
already
elapsed
when
paul
boisgelin
who
was
married
bonnaire
eldest
daughter
then
years
old
as
soon
as
the
lands
of
la
guerdache
had
entered
the
combettes
association
paul
with
feuillat
the
former
farmer
had
begun
to
take
a
passionate
interest
in
promoting
the
fertility
of
the
vast
expanse
which
those
fields
had
enlarged
he
had
become
an
agriculturist
and
directed
one
of
the
sections
of
the
domain
which
it
had
been
necessary
to
divide
into
several
groups
and
it
was
at
his
parents
little
house
at
la
crÃªcherie
whither
he
returned
to
sleep
every
night
that
he
had
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
antoinette
who
lived
with
her
parents
in
a
neighbouring
house
close
intercourse
had
sprung
up
between
that
simple
family
of
workers
and
the
former
heiress
of
the
qurignons
who
now
lived
so
modestly
and
welcomed
every
one
so
kindly
and
although
madame
bonnaire
the
terrible
la
toupe
had
remained
a
rather
difficult
customer
to
deal
with
the
simple
nobility
of
character
displayed
by
bonnaire
that
hero
of
work
one
of
the
founders
of
the
new
city
had
sufficed
to
render
the
intercourse
intimate
it
was
charming
to
see
the
children
loving
one
another
and
drawing
yet
closer
the
links
which
had
thus
been
formed
between
the
representatives
of
two
classes
which
had
formerly
fought
one
against
the
other
antoinette
who
resembled
her
father
being
a
sturdy
brunette
possessed
of
no
little
natural
gracefulness
had
passed
through
sÅurette
schools
and
now
helped
her
at
the
big
dairy
which
was
installed
at
the
end
of
the
park
beside
the
ridge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
as
she
said
with
a
laugh
she
was
simply
a
dairymaid
expert
with
milk
and
cheese
and
butter
when
the
young
people
married
he
paul
a
by
birth
who
had
gone
back
to
the
soil
and
she
antoinette
a
daughter
of
the
people
working
with
her
hands
a
great
was
given
for
there
was
a
desire
to
celebrate
as
gloriously
as
possible
those
symbolical
nuptials
which
proclaimed
the
reconciliation
the
union
of
repentant
capitalism
and
triumphant
work
during
the
ensuing
year
one
warm
june
day
shortly
after
the
birth
of
antoinette
first
child
the
boisgelins
accompanied
by
luc
once
more
found
themselves
together
at
la
guerdache
nearly
ten
years
had
now
elapsed
since
the
death
of
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
and
the
restitution
of
the
estate
to
the
people
in
accordance
with
his
desire
antoinette
had
for
some
time
been
a
in
the
convalescent
home
which
had
been
installed
in
the
chÃ¢teau
where
the
qurignons
had
reigned
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
husband
she
was
now
able
to
stroll
under
the
beautiful
foliage
of
the
park
whilst
suzanne
like
a
good
grandmother
carried
the
baby
a
few
paces
in
the
rear
walked
luc
and
boisgelin
and
what
memories
arose
at
the
sight
of
that
princely
house
those
copses
those
lawns
those
avenues
where
the
uproar
of
costly
the
galloping
of
horses
and
the
baying
of
hounds
no
longer
resounded
but
where
the
humble
of
the
world
at
last
enjoyed
the
open
air
and
the
restful
delight
that
came
from
the
great
trees
all
the
luxury
of
that
magnificent
domain
was
now
theirs
the
convalescent
home
opened
its
bright
its
pleasant
its
larders
to
them
the
park
reserved
for
them
its
shady
paths
its
crystalline
springs
its
lawns
where
for
their
delight
gardeners
cultivated
beds
of
flowers
they
found
there
their
share
of
beauty
and
grace
and
it
was
delightful
to
see
infancy
youth
and
motherhood
which
for
centuries
had
been
condemned
to
suffering
shut
up
in
sunless
hovels
dying
of
filthy
wretchedness
suddenly
summoned
to
partake
of
the
joy
of
life
the
share
of
happiness
belonging
by
right
to
every
human
creature
that
luxury
of
happiness
at
which
innumerable
generations
of
starvelings
had
gazed
from
afar
without
ever
being
able
to
touch
it
as
the
young
married
couple
followed
by
the
others
at
last
reached
a
pool
of
water
glistening
with
limpidity
under
the
blue
sky
beyond
a
row
of
willows
luc
began
to
laugh
softly
my
friends
said
he
a
gay
and
pretty
scene
this
recalls
to
me
you
know
nothing
about
it
eh
nevertheless
it
was
at
the
edge
of
this
calm
water
that
paul
and
antoinette
were
betrothed
a
score
or
so
of
years
ago
then
he
spoke
of
the
delightful
scene
which
he
had
witnessed
beside
that
pond
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
la
guerdache
the
invasion
of
the
park
by
three
youngsters
of
the
streets
nanet
bringing
his
companions
lucien
and
antoinette
bonnaire
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
in
order
that
they
might
play
beside
the
pond
then
ingenious
invention
the
little
boat
which
travelled
all
alone
over
the
water
and
the
arrival
of
the
three
little
paul
boisgelin
nise
delaveau
and
louise
mazelle
who
all
marvelled
at
the
boat
and
immediately
made
friends
with
the
intruders
and
couples
had
been
formed
quite
naturally
there
had
been
betrothals
at
once
paul
with
antoinette
nise
with
nanet
louise
with
lucien
amidst
the
smiling
complicity
of
nature
the
eternal
mother
you
remember
it
asked
luc
gaily
the
young
couple
who
joined
in
his
laughter
declared
that
he
went
back
too
far
i
was
only
four
years
old
said
antoinette
who
felt
highly
amused
memory
could
not
have
been
a
very
strong
one
but
paul
gazing
fixedly
into
the
past
was
making
an
effort
to
recall
the
scene
was
seven
said
he
a
moment
it
seems
to
me
that
i
vaguely
remember
the
little
boat
had
to
be
brought
back
with
a
pole
whenever
its
wheels
ceased
turning
and
then
one
of
the
little
girls
narrowly
missed
falling
into
the
pond
and
afterwards
the
intruders
the
little
bandits
ran
away
on
seeing
some
people
approach
was
it
cried
luc
so
you
remember
well
for
my
part
i
remember
that
day
experiencing
a
quiver
of
hope
in
the
future
for
that
scene
in
some
measure
suggested
the
reconciliation
which
was
to
come
childhood
in
its
naÃ¯ve
fraternity
was
at
work
here
taking
a
first
step
towards
justice
and
peace
and
whatever
fresh
happiness
you
may
bring
about
you
know
will
be
yet
increased
by
that
little
gentleman
yonder
he
pointed
to
the
baby
little
ludovic
now
lying
in
the
arms
of
suzanne
who
felt
so
happy
at
being
a
grandmother
she
on
her
side
jestingly
retorted
the
time
being
he
is
very
good
because
he
is
asleep
later
on
my
dear
luc
we
will
marry
him
to
one
of
your
granddaughters
and
in
that
manner
the
reconciliation
will
be
complete
all
the
combatants
of
yesterday
will
be
united
and
pacified
in
the
persons
of
their
descendants
are
you
willing
shall
we
have
the
betrothal
i
willing
certainly
i
am
our
will
push
on
our
work
hand
in
hand
paul
and
antoinette
felt
moved
and
kissed
one
another
whilst
boisgelin
who
was
not
listening
looked
round
the
park
his
former
estate
in
a
mournful
manner
though
without
any
bitterness
to
such
a
degree
indeed
had
the
new
world
upset
and
stupefied
him
and
then
they
all
resumed
their
walk
along
the
shady
paths
luc
and
suzanne
silently
exchanging
smiles
which
told
their
joy
when
they
all
came
back
to
the
house
they
paused
for
a
moment
before
it
to
the
left
of
the
steps
under
the
windows
of
the
very
room
where
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
had
died
from
that
point
one
perceived
between
the
crests
of
the
great
trees
the
distant
roofs
of
beauclair
and
then
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
abyss
they
gazed
upon
that
spreading
panorama
in
silence
they
could
plainly
distinguish
the
abyss
now
built
afresh
on
the
same
plan
as
la
crÃªcherie
and
forming
with
it
one
sole
city
of
work
work
reorganised
and
ennobled
transformed
into
man
pride
health
and
gaiety
more
justice
and
more
love
were
born
there
every
morning
and
the
waves
of
little
smiling
houses
set
in
greenery
those
waves
which
the
anxious
delaveau
had
seen
always
advancing
had
flowed
over
the
once
black
land
without
a
halt
ever
enlarging
the
future
city
they
now
occupied
the
whole
expanse
from
the
ridge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
to
the
mionne
and
they
would
soon
cross
the
narrow
torrent
to
sweep
away
old
beauclair
that
sordid
agglomeration
of
the
hovels
of
servitude
and
agony
and
as
they
advanced
they
built
up
stone
by
stone
under
the
fraternal
sun
even
to
the
verge
of
the
fertile
fields
of
la
roumagne
the
city
where
all
at
last
would
be
freedom
justice
and
happiness
ii
whilst
evolution
was
carrying
beauclair
towards
its
new
destiny
love
young
gay
and
victorious
asserted
itself
and
on
all
sides
there
came
frequent
marriages
drawing
various
classes
together
and
hastening
the
advent
of
harmony
and
final
peace
love
the
victorious
overthrew
all
obstacles
triumphed
over
the
greatest
resistance
with
a
passion
full
of
happy
vitality
an
explosion
of
joy
which
proclaimed
in
the
broad
sunlight
what
happiness
there
was
in
being
in
loving
in
creating
yet
more
and
more
luc
and
josine
had
set
the
example
during
the
last
ten
years
a
family
of
three
boys
and
two
girls
had
sprung
up
around
them
hilaire
the
eldest
born
before
the
collapse
of
the
abyss
was
already
eleven
then
at
intervals
of
two
years
had
come
the
others
charles
who
was
now
nine
years
old
thÃ©rÃ¨se
who
was
seven
pauline
who
was
five
and
jules
who
was
three
to
the
old
pavilion
another
structure
had
been
added
and
there
these
children
romped
filling
the
place
with
gaiety
and
hope
and
growing
up
for
future
unions
as
luc
in
delight
often
said
to
the
smiling
josine
the
constancy
of
their
affection
sprang
largely
from
that
triumphant
fruitfulness
in
josine
the
had
now
largely
given
way
to
the
mother
yet
she
and
luc
were
still
lovers
for
love
does
not
age
it
remains
the
eternal
flame
the
immortal
brazier
whence
the
life
of
the
world
derives
its
being
never
had
a
home
resounded
with
brighter
gaiety
than
theirs
full
as
it
was
of
children
and
flowers
and
they
loved
one
another
so
well
there
that
misfortune
passed
them
by
whenever
any
recollection
of
the
dolorous
past
returned
when
josine
recalled
her
sufferings
and
the
downfall
in
which
she
would
have
perished
had
it
not
been
for
luc
helping
hand
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
in
a
transport
of
inexhaustible
gratitude
whilst
he
full
of
emotion
felt
that
the
iniquitous
opprobrium
from
which
he
had
saved
her
rendered
her
all
the
dearer
to
him
nanet
little
nanet
who
was
now
becoming
a
man
lodged
with
luc
beside
his
sister
as
he
still
called
josine
gifted
with
keen
intelligence
and
an
enterprising
bravery
which
was
ever
on
the
alert
the
young
fellow
captivated
luc
whose
dearest
pupil
he
became
a
youthful
disciple
full
of
the
master
lessons
and
meantime
at
the
jordans
whose
house
was
so
near
to
luc
nise
little
nise
was
likewise
growing
up
in
the
affectionate
charge
of
sÅurette
who
had
given
her
a
home
on
the
morrow
of
the
destruction
of
the
abyss
happy
in
being
able
to
adopt
the
young
girl
in
whom
she
found
a
charming
companion
and
assistant
and
it
followed
that
nanet
and
nise
seeing
one
another
every
day
ended
by
living
solely
one
for
the
other
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
not
their
betrothal
date
from
infancy
from
the
distant
days
when
divine
ingenuousness
had
filled
them
with
a
craving
to
be
together
impelling
them
to
brave
all
punishments
and
even
to
scale
walls
in
order
to
meet
they
had
been
fair
and
curly
like
little
lambs
in
those
days
and
how
silvery
had
seemed
their
laughter
when
at
each
meeting
they
embraced
knowing
nothing
of
what
parted
them
socially
she
the
by
birth
the
daughter
and
he
the
urchin
of
the
streets
the
penniless
son
of
a
wretched
manual
worker
then
had
come
the
frightful
tempest
of
flames
nise
saved
by
nanet
to
whose
neck
she
had
clung
both
of
them
covered
with
burns
and
at
one
moment
in
danger
of
death
and
also
they
were
both
fair
and
curly
they
gave
vent
to
the
same
light
laughter
as
in
childhood
and
displayed
a
similarity
of
demeanour
as
if
one
matched
the
other
but
nise
had
now
become
a
big
girl
nanet
a
big
youth
and
they
adored
one
another
the
idyll
lasted
for
nearly
seven
years
longer
whilst
luc
was
making
a
man
of
nanet
and
sÅurette
was
helping
nise
to
grow
up
in
kindliness
and
beauty
nise
had
been
thirteen
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
the
terrible
death
of
her
father
and
mother
whose
remains
had
been
reduced
to
ashes
in
such
wise
that
nothing
of
them
was
found
under
the
remnants
of
the
burnt
house
for
long
years
the
girl
shuddered
at
the
recollection
of
that
night
there
was
no
reason
to
hurry
her
marriage
so
far
as
that
was
concerned
indeed
her
friends
wished
to
wait
until
she
should
be
twenty
in
order
that
she
herself
might
come
to
a
free
and
sensible
decision
besides
nanet
himself
was
very
young
her
elder
by
scarcely
three
years
and
still
an
apprentice
with
their
gay
playful
natures
moreover
simply
intent
as
they
were
on
making
merry
together
they
themselves
were
in
no
hurry
they
met
every
evening
and
found
a
simple
enjoyment
in
telling
one
another
what
they
had
done
during
the
day
they
would
often
sit
hand
in
hand
and
when
they
parted
for
the
night
they
exchanged
an
affectionate
kiss
but
amidst
their
cordial
agreement
there
were
at
times
some
little
quarrels
nanet
occasionally
found
nise
too
proud
and
wilful
she
put
on
her
princess
airs
as
he
was
wont
to
remark
again
he
sometimes
thought
her
too
coquettish
too
fond
of
fine
attire
and
of
the
at
which
she
displayed
it
of
course
it
was
not
forbidden
to
appear
beautiful
on
the
contrary
but
it
was
not
right
to
spoil
one
beauty
by
assuming
an
air
of
contempt
for
others
at
first
nise
in
whom
reappeared
some
little
of
her
mother
passion
for
enjoyment
and
her
father
despotic
disposition
grew
angry
when
she
was
reproved
and
endeavoured
to
demonstrate
that
she
was
perfection
itself
but
as
she
worshipped
nanet
she
ended
by
confiding
in
him
listening
to
him
and
striving
to
please
him
by
becoming
the
best
and
gentlest
of
little
women
and
when
as
sometimes
happened
she
did
not
succeed
in
this
she
remarked
with
a
laugh
that
if
she
should
ever
have
a
daughter
the
latter
would
no
doubt
be
much
better
than
herself
because
it
was
necessary
that
the
blood
of
the
princes
of
this
world
should
have
time
to
become
democratised
among
a
more
brotherly
line
of
descendants
the
wedding
at
last
took
place
when
nise
was
twenty
and
nanet
years
old
it
had
long
been
wished
for
foreseen
and
awaited
for
seven
years
not
a
day
had
elapsed
without
a
step
towards
this
of
the
long
and
happy
idyll
and
as
this
marriage
of
delaveau
daughter
with
the
brother
of
josine
who
was
now
to
all
intents
and
purposes
luc
wife
extinguished
all
hatred
and
sealed
a
pact
of
alliance
there
was
a
desire
that
it
should
be
made
a
festival
celebrating
forgiveness
of
the
past
and
the
new
community
radiant
entry
into
the
future
with
this
object
it
was
decided
that
there
should
be
singing
and
dancing
on
the
very
site
of
the
abyss
in
one
of
the
halls
now
erected
there
as
an
adjunct
to
la
crÃªcherie
which
at
present
spread
over
acres
and
acres
of
ground
and
ever
and
ever
grew
luc
and
sÅurette
were
the
organisers
and
masters
of
the
ceremonies
of
this
marriage
festival
as
well
as
the
witnesses
of
the
bridal
pair
luc
being
witness
for
nanet
and
sÅurette
for
nise
they
wished
to
impart
to
the
festival
all
the
splendour
of
a
triumph
to
endow
it
with
the
gaiety
of
hope
fulfilment
to
make
it
like
the
very
victory
of
the
city
of
work
and
peace
now
founded
and
prosperous
it
is
good
that
communities
should
indulge
in
great
rejoicings
public
life
needs
frequent
days
of
beauty
joy
and
exultation
thus
luc
and
sÅurette
chose
the
great
foundry
hall
where
so
many
of
the
hammers
the
gigantic
rolling
bridges
the
movable
cranes
of
prodigious
strength
were
gathered
together
the
new
buildings
all
bricks
and
steelwork
were
clean
and
healthy
and
full
of
joyous
brightness
with
their
large
windows
through
which
streamed
both
air
and
sunlight
and
the
plant
was
left
in
position
especially
as
for
a
festival
of
triumphant
work
one
could
not
have
devised
any
better
decorations
than
were
provided
by
those
gigantic
appliances
whose
powerful
forms
were
instinct
with
a
sovereign
beauty
compounded
of
logic
strength
and
certainty
however
they
were
decorated
with
foliage
and
crowned
with
flowers
even
as
were
altars
in
ancient
times
the
brick
walls
too
were
ornamented
with
garlands
of
verdure
and
the
very
pavement
was
strewn
with
roses
and
broom
flowers
the
whole
seemed
like
the
blossoming
of
man
effort
to
attain
happiness
an
effort
which
had
ended
by
flowering
there
scattering
perfume
around
the
toil
of
the
worker
a
toil
once
unjust
and
hard
but
now
attractive
and
leading
solely
to
happiness
two
processions
set
forth
one
from
the
home
of
the
bridegroom
the
other
from
that
of
the
bride
on
his
side
luc
followed
by
his
wife
josine
and
their
children
brought
the
hero
nanet
on
hers
sÅurette
with
her
brother
jordan
brought
their
adopted
daughter
the
heroine
nise
the
whole
population
of
the
new
city
where
all
work
was
stopped
in
token
of
rejoicing
lined
the
road
to
acclaim
the
bridal
pair
the
beautiful
sun
shone
out
the
gay
houses
were
decked
with
bright
colours
the
greenery
was
full
of
flowers
and
birds
and
in
the
rear
of
either
followed
the
crowd
of
workers
a
vast
concourse
of
joyous
people
who
gradually
invaded
the
great
halls
of
the
works
which
were
as
lofty
and
as
broad
as
the
naves
of
the
cathedrals
the
foundry
hall
whither
the
bridal
couple
repaired
was
soon
crowded
to
excess
in
spite
of
its
immensity
in
addition
to
luc
his
family
and
the
jordans
there
were
the
boisgelins
with
paul
who
at
that
time
had
not
yet
married
antoinette
for
their
wedding
was
only
to
take
place
four
years
later
then
came
the
bonnaires
the
bourrons
even
the
fauchards
indeed
all
those
whose
arms
had
contributed
to
the
victory
of
work
those
men
of
good
will
and
faith
those
workers
of
the
first
days
had
increased
and
multiplied
was
not
the
throng
of
comrades
around
them
an
enlargement
of
their
families
an
assemblage
of
brothers
whose
numbers
still
increased
daily
there
were
five
thousand
of
them
and
soon
there
would
be
ten
they
would
increase
to
a
hundred
thousand
to
a
million
and
would
at
last
absorb
all
mankind
the
ceremony
in
the
midst
of
the
powerful
machinery
decked
with
flowers
and
garlands
of
verdure
was
one
of
sovereign
and
touching
simplicity
with
smiling
mien
luc
and
sÅurette
placed
nanet
and
nise
hands
one
in
the
other
one
another
with
all
your
hearts
they
said
to
them
have
handsome
children
who
will
love
one
another
as
you
yourselves
will
be
loved
the
crowd
raised
acclamations
and
shouted
the
word
for
it
was
king
love
who
alone
could
render
work
fruitful
by
making
the
race
ever
more
and
more
numerous
and
inflaming
it
with
desire
the
eternal
source
of
life
but
in
all
this
there
was
already
too
much
solemnity
for
nanet
and
nise
who
had
loved
one
another
so
playfully
ever
since
childhood
although
those
two
little
curly
lambs
had
grown
up
they
remained
like
toys
in
their
festival
raiment
both
clad
in
white
charming
and
delightful
and
they
were
not
content
with
a
ceremonious
they
fell
upon
each
other
neck
my
little
nise
how
happy
i
am
to
have
you
for
my
wife
at
last
after
waiting
for
you
for
years
and
years
my
little
nanet
how
happy
i
am
to
belong
to
you
for
it
is
quite
true
you
have
earned
it
little
nise
do
you
remember
when
i
pulled
you
up
by
the
arms
to
help
you
over
the
walls
and
when
i
carried
you
and
played
at
being
a
rearing
horse
little
nanet
do
you
remember
when
we
played
at
and
you
ended
by
finding
me
among
the
rosebushes
so
well
hidden
there
that
it
was
enough
to
make
me
die
of
laughing
nise
little
nise
we
love
each
other
as
we
played
very
heartily
with
all
all
the
strength
of
health
and
gaiety
nanet
little
nanet
we
played
so
much
and
we
will
love
one
another
so
much
that
we
shall
love
yet
again
in
our
children
and
play
again
even
with
our
children
children
and
they
embraced
and
laughed
and
played
together
raised
to
the
highest
felicity
the
throng
filled
with
enthusiasm
by
the
sight
traversed
by
a
wave
of
sonorous
gaiety
clapped
hands
and
acclaimed
love
almighty
love
which
without
cessation
creates
more
and
more
life
and
happiness
then
the
singing
began
chorus
singing
in
which
the
aged
sang
their
rest
the
men
the
triumph
of
their
toil
the
women
the
helpful
sweetness
of
their
love
the
children
the
confident
cheerfulness
of
their
hopes
afterwards
came
the
dances
with
a
great
final
round
and
chain
which
brought
all
that
brotherly
little
people
hand
in
hand
stretching
out
and
revolving
for
hours
to
the
strains
of
gay
music
through
the
halls
of
the
huge
works
they
had
formerly
toiled
so
much
and
suffered
so
much
in
the
dirty
grimy
unhealthy
inferno
which
had
stood
there
and
which
the
flames
had
swept
away
the
sunshine
the
air
and
life
now
entered
freely
and
the
marriage
still
came
and
went
around
the
huge
appliances
the
colossal
presses
the
formidable
steam
hammers
the
gigantic
which
wore
a
smiling
aspect
beneath
their
adornments
of
flowers
and
foliage
whilst
the
young
married
couple
led
the
dance
as
if
in
them
rested
the
soul
of
all
those
things
that
morrow
of
increase
in
equity
and
fraternity
which
the
victory
of
their
long
affection
had
ensured
luc
was
preparing
a
surprise
for
jordan
for
he
also
wished
to
celebrate
the
labour
of
the
scientist
whose
endeavours
would
contribute
more
than
a
hundred
years
of
politics
could
have
done
to
the
happiness
of
the
city
when
the
night
had
fallen
and
it
was
quite
dark
the
whole
works
suddenly
glowed
thousands
of
lamps
casting
the
gay
light
of
over
the
place
jordan
researches
it
should
be
said
had
at
last
yielded
fruit
after
many
defeats
he
had
devised
a
system
for
the
transport
of
electrical
force
without
loss
employing
new
appliances
ingenious
means
of
transmission
henceforth
the
cost
of
conveying
coal
was
saved
it
was
burnt
at
the
pit
mouth
and
the
machinery
which
transformed
calorical
into
electrical
energy
sent
it
to
la
crÃªcherie
by
special
cables
which
allowed
of
no
loss
on
the
way
in
such
wise
that
the
cost
price
was
now
only
half
of
what
it
had
formerly
been
this
then
was
a
first
great
victory
la
crÃªcherie
profusely
illumined
power
distributed
abundantly
among
both
the
large
and
the
small
appliances
comfort
increased
work
facilitated
and
fortune
augmented
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
virtually
a
fresh
step
towards
happiness
when
jordan
on
beholding
the
festive
illumination
understood
affectionate
intention
he
began
to
laugh
like
a
child
my
friend
so
you
give
me
a
bouquet
too
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
rather
deserve
it
for
as
you
must
remember
i
had
been
striving
to
solve
the
problem
for
ten
long
years
what
obstacles
what
defeats
did
i
not
encounter
when
i
imagined
success
to
be
a
certainty
but
no
matter
i
set
to
work
afresh
on
the
morrow
on
the
ruins
of
all
the
experiments
that
had
failed
a
man
always
ends
by
succeeding
when
he
works
luc
was
laughing
with
his
friend
whose
courage
and
faith
he
shared
know
that
very
well
said
he
in
reply
are
the
living
proof
of
it
i
know
no
greater
loftier
master
of
energy
than
you
and
i
have
tried
to
follow
your
example
well
so
night
is
now
vanquished
you
have
put
darkness
to
flight
and
as
electricity
at
present
costs
so
little
we
shall
be
able
to
light
up
a
planet
above
la
crÃªcherie
to
replace
the
sun
as
soon
as
evening
comes
and
you
have
also
wrought
economy
in
human
toil
for
thanks
to
the
abundance
of
mechanical
power
yielded
by
your
system
one
man
now
suffices
for
work
in
which
two
had
to
be
employed
thus
we
acclaim
you
as
the
master
of
light
and
warmth
and
power
jordan
wrapped
in
a
rug
which
sÅurette
fearing
the
coolness
of
the
evening
had
thrown
over
his
shoulders
was
still
looking
at
the
huge
pile
around
him
now
sparkling
like
a
palace
of
fairyland
short
and
puny
with
a
pale
face
and
the
feeble
air
of
one
who
is
on
the
point
of
dying
he
strolled
about
those
glowing
halls
examining
them
curiously
for
during
the
last
ten
years
he
had
scarcely
stirred
from
his
laboratory
thus
he
marvelled
at
the
results
already
obtained
the
success
of
a
work
of
which
he
had
been
both
the
least
known
and
the
most
active
artisan
yes
he
muttered
result
is
very
good
already
no
little
ground
has
been
gained
we
are
advancing
the
future
we
dreamt
of
is
nearer
to
us
and
i
owe
you
my
apologies
my
dear
luc
for
i
did
not
hide
from
you
at
the
outset
that
i
scarcely
believed
in
the
success
of
your
mission
but
you
still
have
a
great
deal
to
accomplish
and
for
my
part
alas
i
have
done
next
to
nothing
by
the
side
of
all
that
i
should
like
to
do
he
became
grave
and
thoughtful
we
have
reduced
the
cost
of
electricity
by
one
half
it
still
remains
too
high
he
said
besides
all
the
intricate
and
expensive
installations
at
the
mouths
of
the
pits
the
steam
engines
and
the
boilers
without
mentioning
the
miles
of
cables
which
have
to
be
kept
in
repair
are
barbarous
and
consume
time
and
money
something
else
is
needed
something
more
practical
simple
and
direct
i
know
very
well
in
what
direction
i
ought
to
look
but
such
a
search
seems
madness
and
i
do
dare
to
tell
people
what
work
i
have
undertaken
for
i
myself
ca
describe
it
clearly
yet
yes
one
ought
to
suppress
the
engine
and
the
boiler
which
are
cumbersome
intermediaries
between
the
coal
extracted
and
the
electricity
which
is
produced
in
a
word
one
ought
to
be
able
to
transform
the
calorical
energy
contained
in
the
coal
into
electrical
energy
without
having
to
bring
mechanical
energy
into
play
i
yet
know
how
that
is
to
be
done
but
i
have
set
to
work
and
i
hope
to
succeed
and
if
i
do
you
then
see
that
electricity
will
cost
scarcely
anything
we
shall
be
able
to
give
it
to
everybody
spread
it
broadcast
and
make
it
the
victorious
agent
of
universal
comfort
he
grew
more
and
more
enthusiastic
drawing
himself
up
with
passionate
gestures
as
he
spoke
he
who
as
a
rule
remained
so
silent
and
thoughtful
day
must
come
he
resumed
electricity
will
belong
to
everybody
like
the
water
of
the
rivers
and
the
breezes
of
the
heavens
it
will
be
necessary
to
give
it
abundantly
to
one
and
all
and
to
allow
men
to
dispose
of
it
as
they
choose
it
must
circulate
in
our
towns
like
the
very
blood
of
social
life
in
each
house
one
must
merely
have
to
turn
on
a
switch
or
a
tap
to
obtain
a
profusion
of
power
heat
and
light
at
in
the
black
sky
electricity
will
set
another
sun
which
will
extinguish
the
stars
and
it
will
suppress
winter
it
will
bring
eternal
summer
into
being
warming
the
old
earth
and
ascending
to
melt
the
snow
even
among
the
clouds
this
is
why
i
am
not
particularly
proud
of
what
i
have
done
as
yet
for
it
is
very
little
by
the
side
of
all
that
has
to
be
accomplished
and
with
an
air
of
quiet
disdain
he
concluded
ca
even
get
a
practical
result
from
my
electrical
furnaces
they
are
still
mere
experimental
furnaces
electricity
is
still
too
costly
one
must
wait
till
its
employment
proves
remunerative
and
for
that
to
be
it
should
not
cost
us
more
than
the
waters
of
the
rivers
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
heavens
when
i
am
able
to
give
it
in
a
flood
without
counting
my
furnaces
will
revolutionise
metallurgy
oh
i
well
know
the
only
path
to
follow
and
i
have
already
set
to
work
the
night
festival
was
a
marvellous
one
the
dancing
and
singing
had
begun
afresh
in
the
dazzling
halls
where
the
throng
continued
celebrating
the
marriage
until
the
time
came
to
escort
nanet
and
nise
to
their
nuptial
home
amidst
acclamations
in
honour
of
the
love
which
had
united
them
about
this
time
love
likewise
revolutionised
the
of
beauclair
and
it
was
in
the
home
of
the
mazelles
those
idlers
living
on
their
income
that
the
tempest
first
burst
forth
their
daughter
louise
had
always
surprised
and
upset
them
so
different
was
her
nature
from
their
own
an
extremely
active
and
enterprising
girl
she
was
ever
at
work
in
the
house
declaring
that
idleness
would
kill
her
her
parents
who
placed
their
great
delight
in
doing
nothing
could
not
understand
how
it
was
that
she
spoilt
her
days
by
useless
agitation
she
was
an
only
child
said
they
and
would
have
a
very
fine
fortune
invested
in
state
rentes
and
so
was
she
not
unreasonable
in
refusing
to
shut
herself
up
in
her
cosy
nook
well
sheltered
from
the
worries
of
life
they
her
parents
were
content
with
their
egotistical
happiness
and
why
therefore
did
she
trouble
about
the
passing
beggar
the
ideas
which
were
changing
the
world
the
incidents
which
disturbed
the
streets
but
whatever
might
be
said
she
remained
all
of
a
quiver
full
of
life
taking
a
passionate
interest
in
everything
and
thus
amidst
her
parents
deep
love
for
her
there
was
a
great
deal
of
stupefaction
at
having
a
daughter
so
utterly
unlike
themselves
at
last
she
utterly
upset
them
by
a
de
at
which
they
had
at
first
simply
shrugged
their
shoulders
thinking
it
some
mere
fancy
or
whim
but
things
soon
came
to
such
a
climax
that
they
almost
believed
the
end
of
the
world
to
be
at
hand
louise
mazelle
had
remained
a
great
friend
of
nise
delaveau
whom
she
had
frequently
met
at
the
home
of
the
boisgelins
since
the
latter
had
been
installed
at
la
crÃªcherie
there
also
she
had
again
met
lucien
bonnaire
her
former
playmate
now
a
tall
and
handsome
fellow
of
whilst
she
herself
was
twenty
lucien
no
longer
made
little
boats
which
travelled
by
themselves
over
the
water
but
under
luc
guidance
he
had
become
a
very
intelligent
and
inventive
mechanician
destined
to
render
great
services
to
la
crÃªcherie
where
he
already
fitted
up
the
machinery
he
was
not
a
he
took
a
sort
of
courageous
pride
in
remaining
a
simple
workman
like
his
father
whom
he
revered
and
no
doubt
in
the
ardent
love
with
which
louise
was
inspired
for
him
there
was
some
little
of
the
natural
rebellion
which
urged
her
on
to
flout
notions
and
to
behave
differently
from
the
folk
of
her
sphere
at
all
events
her
old
friendship
for
lucien
became
a
passionate
love
that
chafed
at
obstacles
he
touched
by
the
keen
attachment
of
that
pretty
active
smiling
girl
ended
by
loving
her
quite
as
deeply
but
he
was
certainly
the
more
reasonable
of
the
two
and
desired
to
hurt
nobody
feelings
he
suffered
at
the
idea
that
she
was
too
refined
and
too
rich
for
him
and
simply
spoke
of
remaining
a
bachelor
if
he
could
not
have
her
whereas
she
at
the
mere
thought
of
opposition
to
their
marriage
became
wildly
rebellious
and
talked
of
throwing
up
position
and
fortune
to
go
and
live
with
him
during
nearly
six
months
the
battle
went
on
lucien
parents
looked
on
the
proposed
marriage
with
covert
distrust
bonnaire
with
his
common
sense
would
much
have
preferred
to
see
his
son
marry
some
daughter
time
had
already
done
its
work
and
there
was
no
reason
to
be
proud
of
seeing
one
son
rise
to
another
class
on
the
arm
of
a
daughter
of
the
expiring
all
the
profit
of
such
an
alliance
would
soon
be
on
the
side
of
the
itself
which
would
intermarry
with
the
people
in
order
to
regain
blood
and
health
and
strength
quarrels
on
the
subject
of
the
match
at
last
broke
out
in
bonnaire
household
his
wife
the
proud
and
terrible
toupe
would
doubtless
have
consented
to
it
on
condition
that
she
also
became
a
lady
with
fine
gowns
and
jewels
to
wear
nought
of
the
evolution
now
in
progress
around
her
had
lessened
her
craving
for
domination
and
display
she
retained
her
hateful
disposition
even
in
her
present
easy
circumstances
often
reproaching
her
husband
for
not
having
made
a
big
fortune
like
monsieur
mazelle
an
artful
fellow
who
had
done
no
work
for
years
past
however
when
she
heard
lucien
declare
that
even
if
he
should
marry
louise
not
a
copper
of
the
mazelles
money
should
ever
enter
his
home
she
quite
lost
her
head
and
in
her
turn
opposed
the
match
since
it
would
not
bring
her
any
profit
one
evening
there
was
a
stormy
explanation
between
la
toupe
bonnaire
and
lucien
in
the
presence
of
daddy
lunot
who
was
still
alive
and
more
than
seventy
years
old
they
had
just
finished
dining
in
the
bright
clean
whose
window
opened
on
to
the
garden
greenery
there
were
even
flowers
on
the
table
where
nowadays
food
was
always
plentiful
daddy
lunot
who
at
present
had
as
much
tobacco
as
he
cared
for
had
just
lighted
his
pipe
when
la
toupe
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
getting
into
a
temper
according
to
her
old
habit
turned
to
lucien
and
said
to
him
sourly
it
decided
eh
you
still
mean
to
marry
that
i
saw
you
with
her
again
this
morning
at
boisgelin
door
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
cared
anything
for
us
you
might
have
ceased
meeting
her
since
you
know
that
both
your
father
and
myself
are
by
no
means
with
the
idea
of
that
marriage
lucien
like
a
good
son
avoided
argument
particularly
as
he
knew
it
to
be
useless
turning
towards
bonnaire
he
simply
said
i
think
that
my
father
is
ready
to
consent
to
la
toupe
this
was
like
a
which
urged
her
upon
her
husband
she
exclaimed
give
your
consent
without
warning
me
of
it
you
told
me
less
than
a
fortnight
ago
that
such
a
marriage
was
reasonable
to
your
thinking
and
that
you
would
have
fears
for
our
lad
happiness
if
he
were
so
foolish
as
to
make
it
so
you
turn
about
like
a
eh
bonnaire
quietly
began
to
explain
things
should
have
preferred
to
see
the
lad
make
another
choice
but
he
nearly
and
i
not
going
to
force
my
will
on
him
in
a
matter
which
concerns
his
own
heart
he
knows
what
i
think
and
he
do
what
he
thinks
best
shouted
back
la
toupe
easily
got
over
you
fancy
yourself
a
free
man
but
you
always
end
by
saying
the
same
as
the
others
during
the
twenty
years
that
you
been
here
with
monsieur
luc
you
repeated
that
his
ideas
and
yours
are
not
the
same
and
that
he
ought
to
have
begun
by
seizing
the
instruments
of
work
without
accepting
money
from
the
but
all
the
same
you
give
way
to
monsieur
luc
wishes
and
perhaps
you
begin
to
like
what
you
done
together
she
rattled
on
striving
to
hurt
her
husband
feelings
and
pride
she
had
often
exasperated
him
by
trying
to
prove
that
his
actions
were
in
contradiction
with
his
principles
this
time
however
he
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
doubt
that
what
we
done
together
is
very
good
said
he
may
still
regret
that
monsieur
luc
did
not
follow
my
ideas
only
you
ought
to
be
the
last
to
complain
of
what
exists
here
for
we
know
nothing
more
of
want
we
are
happy
happier
than
any
one
of
those
whom
you
dream
about
this
reply
irritated
her
the
more
for
what
exists
here
it
would
be
kind
of
you
to
explain
it
to
me
for
i
never
understood
anything
of
it
you
know
she
said
you
are
happy
so
much
the
better
for
you
but
i
not
happy
no
i
not
happiness
is
when
one
has
plenty
of
money
and
can
retire
and
do
nothing
afterwards
all
your
rigmarole
your
division
of
profits
your
stores
where
one
gets
things
cheaply
your
coupons
and
your
will
never
put
a
hundred
thousand
francs
into
my
pocket
so
that
i
may
spend
them
as
i
please
on
things
which
i
like
i
am
an
unhappy
woman
a
very
unhappy
woman
she
was
exaggerating
things
with
the
desire
to
make
herself
disagreeable
yet
there
was
truth
in
what
she
said
she
had
never
grown
accustomed
to
la
crÃªcherie
she
suffered
there
like
a
coquettish
extravagant
woman
whose
instincts
were
wounded
by
communistic
solidarity
a
clean
and
active
housewife
but
of
a
quarrelsome
stubborn
nature
she
continued
making
her
home
a
hell
when
it
should
have
been
full
of
comfort
bonnaire
at
last
lost
his
patience
so
far
as
to
say
to
her
are
mad
it
is
you
who
make
yourself
unhappy
and
us
too
thereupon
she
began
to
sob
lucien
who
felt
very
embarrassed
whenever
such
disputes
arose
between
his
parents
had
to
emerge
from
his
silence
and
kiss
her
and
tell
her
that
he
loved
and
respected
her
nevertheless
she
clung
to
her
views
and
shouted
to
her
husband
just
ask
my
father
what
he
thinks
of
your
factory
in
which
everybody
has
a
share
and
that
wonderful
justice
and
happiness
of
yours
which
are
to
regenerate
the
world
he
an
old
workman
he
is
you
wo
accuse
him
of
saying
foolish
things
like
a
woman
and
he
seventy
years
old
so
you
can
believe
in
his
experience
and
sense
turning
to
daddy
lunot
who
was
sucking
the
stem
of
his
pipe
with
the
blissful
expression
of
a
child
she
went
on
that
so
father
are
they
idiots
with
all
their
inventions
to
do
without
masters
and
wo
they
end
by
making
their
own
fingers
smart
the
old
man
looked
at
her
in
his
bewildered
way
before
answering
in
a
husky
voice
course
the
ragus
and
the
qurignons
ah
they
were
comrades
once
upon
a
time
there
was
monsieur
michel
who
was
five
years
my
senior
as
for
me
it
was
under
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
that
i
entered
the
works
but
before
the
others
there
was
monsieur
blaise
with
whom
my
father
jean
ragu
and
my
grandfather
pierre
ragu
worked
pierre
ragu
and
blaise
qurignon
were
mates
together
two
who
used
the
same
anvil
and
now
you
see
the
qurignons
are
masters
and
great
millionaires
and
the
ragus
have
remained
poor
devils
as
they
were
before
things
ca
change
and
so
one
must
believe
that
they
are
well
as
they
are
he
rambled
slightly
in
the
somnolence
that
had
come
over
him
as
over
some
very
old
maimed
and
forgotten
beast
of
burden
who
by
a
miracle
had
escaped
the
universal
slaughterhouse
there
were
often
days
when
he
failed
to
remember
what
had
happened
on
the
previous
one
daddy
lunot
said
bonnaire
so
happens
that
things
have
changed
a
good
deal
for
some
time
past
monsieur
jÃ©rÃ´me
whom
you
speak
of
has
long
since
been
dead
and
he
gave
back
all
that
remained
of
his
fortune
back
how
that
he
gave
back
to
his
old
comrades
the
wealth
which
he
owed
to
their
toil
and
suffering
do
you
remember
it
occurred
a
long
time
ago
already
the
old
man
searched
in
his
dim
memory
yes
yes
i
recollect
a
funny
business
it
was
well
if
he
gave
his
money
back
he
was
a
fool
the
words
were
spoken
sharply
and
contemptuously
for
daddy
lunot
had
never
dreamt
of
anything
but
making
a
big
fortune
like
the
qurignons
in
order
to
enjoy
life
like
a
master
an
idle
gentleman
who
amused
himself
from
morning
till
night
that
had
remained
his
ideal
even
as
it
was
that
of
the
whole
generation
of
exploited
slaves
whoso
sole
regret
was
that
they
had
not
been
born
among
the
exploiters
la
toupe
burst
into
an
insulting
laugh
see
she
cried
is
such
a
fool
as
you
others
are
he
not
the
man
to
start
on
a
chase
money
money
and
when
a
man
rich
he
the
master
bonnaire
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
whilst
lucien
gazed
in
silence
through
the
window
at
the
roses
in
the
garden
what
was
the
use
of
arguing
she
represented
the
stubborn
past
she
would
pass
away
in
the
communist
paradise
in
the
midst
of
fraternal
happiness
denying
its
very
existence
and
regretting
the
days
of
wretchedness
when
she
had
been
obliged
to
save
up
ten
sous
one
by
one
in
order
to
buy
herself
a
strip
of
ribbon
just
then
however
babette
bourron
came
in
unlike
la
toupe
she
was
ever
gay
ever
delighted
with
her
new
position
by
her
smiling
and
comforting
optimism
she
had
helped
to
save
her
simpleton
of
a
husband
from
the
pit
into
which
ragu
had
fallen
she
had
invariably
shown
confidence
in
the
future
feeling
certain
that
things
would
eventually
turn
out
all
right
and
she
often
jestingly
remarked
that
la
crÃªcherie
where
work
had
become
light
cleanly
and
pleasant
where
one
and
all
lived
amidst
comforts
formerly
reserved
to
the
alone
was
like
a
fulfilment
of
her
dreams
of
paradise
her
face
remained
under
her
carelessly
twisted
hair
and
radiant
with
the
delight
she
felt
at
finding
her
husband
cured
of
his
passion
for
drink
and
at
living
in
a
gay
house
of
her
own
with
two
handsome
children
whom
she
would
soon
be
marrying
off
so
it
decided
eh
she
exclaimed
is
going
to
marry
louise
mazelle
that
charming
little
who
is
ashamed
of
us
told
you
that
roughly
asked
la
toupe
madame
luc
josine
whom
i
met
this
morning
la
toupe
turned
white
with
restrained
wrath
amidst
her
ceaseless
irritation
with
la
crÃªcherie
there
was
a
great
deal
of
hatred
against
josine
whom
she
had
never
forgiven
for
having
become
the
wife
and
helpmate
of
luc
that
hero
whom
all
admired
and
for
having
moreover
a
number
of
handsome
children
who
were
now
growing
up
for
lives
of
happiness
could
she
not
remember
the
days
when
that
wretched
creature
had
been
turned
starving
into
the
streets
by
her
brother
yet
now
she
met
her
wearing
a
bonnet
like
a
lady
that
was
a
crushing
blow
she
would
never
be
able
to
stomach
the
idea
of
that
creature
being
happy
she
roughly
exclaimed
do
better
to
make
people
forget
what
she
calls
her
own
marriage
before
meddling
with
marriages
which
do
concern
her
and
as
for
me
you
do
nothing
but
aggravate
me
so
just
let
me
be
then
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
banging
the
door
behind
her
and
leaving
the
others
in
silent
embarrassment
babette
was
the
first
to
laugh
accustomed
as
she
was
to
the
manners
of
her
friend
whom
she
indulgently
pronounced
to
be
a
good
woman
though
a
one
tears
however
had
risen
to
the
eyes
of
lucien
for
it
was
his
future
life
that
was
at
stake
amidst
all
that
quarrelling
his
father
pressed
his
hand
in
a
friendly
way
as
if
to
promise
that
he
would
arrange
matters
none
the
less
bonnaire
himself
remained
very
sad
quite
upset
at
finding
happiness
at
the
mercy
of
family
jars
would
a
spiteful
temper
always
suffice
then
to
spoil
the
fruits
of
brotherliness
he
wondered
daddy
lunot
alone
retained
his
blissful
unconsciousness
sitting
there
half
asleep
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
if
lucien
entertained
no
doubt
of
the
eventual
consent
of
his
parents
louise
felt
the
resistance
of
hers
increasing
and
thus
the
battle
became
fiercer
every
day
the
mazelles
adored
their
daughter
and
it
was
in
the
name
of
this
adoration
that
they
refused
to
give
way
to
her
there
were
no
violent
explanations
between
them
but
they
persevered
in
a
kind
of
inertia
by
which
they
fancied
that
the
patience
would
be
tired
out
in
vain
did
she
fill
the
house
with
the
incessant
rustling
of
her
skirts
play
feverishly
on
the
piano
fling
flowers
out
of
the
window
though
they
were
by
no
means
faded
and
give
many
other
signs
of
perturbation
they
still
peacefully
smiled
at
her
made
a
pretence
of
understanding
nothing
and
strove
to
glut
her
with
dainties
and
presents
she
was
enraged
at
being
thus
overwhelmed
with
douceurs
when
she
was
denied
the
one
thing
which
would
have
pleased
her
and
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
to
fall
she
took
to
her
bed
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
refused
to
answer
her
parents
when
they
questioned
her
novarre
on
being
summoned
declared
that
such
ailments
did
not
come
within
the
scope
of
his
profession
the
only
way
to
cure
girls
who
fell
was
to
allow
them
to
love
as
they
desired
thereupon
the
mazelles
quite
distracted
realising
that
the
matter
was
becoming
a
serious
one
held
counsel
together
as
to
whether
they
ought
to
give
way
they
spent
a
whole
night
talking
it
over
and
it
seemed
such
a
serious
business
the
consequences
of
which
might
be
so
great
that
they
lacked
the
courage
to
come
to
a
decision
between
themselves
they
resolved
to
bring
their
friends
together
in
order
to
submit
the
matter
to
them
in
the
revolutionary
state
of
affairs
with
which
beauclair
was
struggling
would
it
not
be
desertion
on
their
part
to
give
their
daughter
to
a
workman
they
felt
that
such
a
union
would
be
decisive
a
final
abdication
on
the
part
of
the
the
mercantile
and
propertied
folk
and
it
was
therefore
natural
that
the
authorities
the
leaders
of
the
wealthy
governing
classes
should
be
consulted
thus
one
fine
afternoon
they
invited
chÃ¢telard
mayor
gourier
judge
gaume
and
abbÃ©
marle
to
take
tea
with
them
in
their
flowery
garden
where
they
had
spent
so
many
idle
days
stretched
face
to
face
in
large
rocking
chairs
and
gazing
at
their
roses
without
even
tiring
themselves
by
talking
see
said
mazelle
to
his
wife
will
do
what
those
gentlemen
advise
they
know
more
about
such
matters
than
we
do
and
nobody
will
be
able
to
blame
us
for
following
their
counsel
for
my
part
i
am
quite
losing
my
head
for
all
this
business
tortures
my
brain
from
morning
till
night
like
me
said
madame
mazelle
is
living
to
be
obliged
to
keep
on
thinking
and
thinking
nothing
could
be
worse
for
my
complaint
i
sure
of
it
the
tea
was
served
in
an
arbour
of
greenery
in
the
garden
one
beautiful
sunshiny
afternoon
chÃ¢telard
and
mayor
gourier
were
the
first
to
arrive
they
had
remained
inseparable
linked
it
seemed
even
more
closely
together
since
the
death
of
madame
gourier
the
beautiful
lÃ©onore
who
during
her
last
five
years
had
remained
an
invalid
in
an
afflicted
with
paralysis
of
the
legs
but
most
devotedly
nursed
her
lover
taking
her
husband
place
to
watch
over
her
and
read
to
her
whenever
the
other
was
obliged
to
absent
himself
it
was
indeed
in
chÃ¢telard
arms
that
lÃ©onore
had
suddenly
expired
one
evening
while
he
was
helping
her
to
drink
a
cupful
of
whilst
gourier
was
outside
smoking
a
cigar
when
he
came
in
again
the
two
men
wept
together
for
the
dear
departed
and
nowadays
they
were
inseparable
their
duties
leaving
them
plenty
of
leisure
for
it
was
only
in
a
theoretical
kind
of
way
that
they
now
governed
the
town
the
having
prevailed
on
the
mayor
to
follow
his
example
and
let
things
take
their
own
course
rather
than
spoil
his
life
by
trying
to
oppose
the
evolution
the
progress
of
which
nobody
in
the
world
could
have
prevented
nevertheless
gourier
who
often
felt
afraid
of
the
future
had
some
difficulty
in
taking
this
philosophical
course
he
had
become
reconciled
to
his
son
achille
whom
had
presented
with
a
very
charming
daughter
lÃ©onie
who
had
the
eyes
of
her
beautiful
mother
big
blue
eyes
suggesting
some
large
blue
lake
some
vast
stretch
of
blue
sky
nearly
twenty
years
of
age
at
present
fit
to
be
married
lÃ©onie
had
captivated
her
grandfather
and
he
had
resigned
himself
to
opening
his
door
to
her
parents
that
son
who
had
formerly
rebelled
against
his
authority
and
that
of
whom
he
still
occasionally
spoke
as
a
savage
as
he
himself
expressed
it
it
was
hard
for
him
a
mayor
the
celebrant
of
lawful
marriage
to
receive
at
his
fireside
a
couple
of
revolutionaries
who
had
simply
espoused
one
another
under
the
stars
one
warm
summer
night
but
the
times
were
so
strange
such
extraordinary
things
happened
that
a
charming
granddaughter
become
a
very
acceptable
present
even
although
she
were
the
offspring
of
impenitent
free
love
chÃ¢telard
had
gaily
insisted
on
reconciliation
and
gourier
since
his
son
had
been
bringing
lÃ©onie
to
see
him
had
been
more
and
more
won
over
to
the
cause
of
la
crÃªcherie
though
to
his
thinking
it
had
hitherto
remained
a
source
of
catastrophes
judge
gaume
and
abbÃ©
marle
were
late
in
arriving
that
day
at
the
mazelles
but
the
latter
could
not
refrain
from
explaining
their
position
to
the
and
the
mayor
ought
they
to
resign
themselves
to
their
daughter
unreasonable
whim
you
will
certainly
understand
monsieur
le
said
mazelle
in
an
anxious
but
pompous
manner
from
the
grief
which
such
a
marriage
would
cause
us
we
have
to
consider
the
deplorable
effect
which
it
would
have
socially
and
our
heavy
responsibility
towards
distinguished
persons
of
our
class
we
really
seem
to
be
going
towards
some
abyss
they
were
seated
in
the
warm
shade
perfumed
by
the
climbing
roses
at
a
table
with
napery
on
which
stood
several
dishes
of
little
cakes
and
chÃ¢telard
still
a
man
in
spite
of
his
years
smiled
in
a
discreetly
ironical
manner
are
already
in
the
abyss
dear
monsieur
mazelle
he
replied
would
be
very
wrong
of
you
to
put
yourself
out
about
the
government
the
authorities
or
even
fine
society
for
only
a
semblance
of
these
things
now
exists
i
am
still
and
my
friend
gourier
is
still
mayor
no
doubt
only
we
are
scarcely
more
than
shadows
and
there
is
no
longer
any
real
substantial
state
behind
us
and
it
is
the
same
with
the
powerful
and
the
wealthy
a
little
of
whose
power
and
wealth
is
carried
off
each
succeeding
day
by
the
new
organisation
of
work
so
do
take
the
trouble
to
defend
them
particularly
as
they
themselves
yielding
to
vertigo
are
now
becoming
active
artisans
of
the
revolution
do
resist
then
yield
to
the
current
he
was
fond
of
that
style
of
jesting
which
terrified
the
last
of
beauclair
moreover
it
was
an
amiable
and
jocular
way
of
telling
the
truth
for
he
indeed
felt
convinced
that
the
old
world
was
done
for
and
that
a
new
one
was
springing
from
the
ruins
most
serious
events
were
taking
place
in
paris
the
ancient
edifice
was
falling
stone
by
stone
giving
place
to
a
provisional
structure
in
which
one
could
already
plainly
detect
the
outlines
of
the
future
city
of
justice
and
peace
but
the
mazelles
had
turned
pale
whilst
the
wife
sank
back
in
her
armchair
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
little
cakes
the
husband
exclaimed
do
you
think
us
threatened
to
such
a
point
as
that
i
know
very
well
that
people
think
of
reducing
the
interest
on
rentes
said
chÃ¢telard
quietly
will
be
suppressed
before
another
twenty
years
have
gone
by
or
rather
some
plan
will
be
found
for
dispossessing
the
by
degrees
a
scheme
to
that
effect
is
already
being
studied
madame
mazelle
heaved
such
a
desperate
sigh
that
one
might
have
imagined
she
was
giving
up
the
ghost
i
hope
we
shall
be
dead
by
then
said
she
hope
that
we
sha
have
the
grief
of
witnessing
such
infamy
but
our
poor
daughter
will
suffer
by
it
and
that
is
an
additional
reason
for
compelling
her
to
make
a
good
marriage
but
chÃ¢telard
pitilessly
went
on
good
marriages
are
no
longer
possible
since
the
right
of
inheritance
is
about
to
disappear
that
is
virtually
resolved
upon
in
future
each
married
couple
will
have
to
work
out
its
own
happiness
and
whether
your
daughter
louise
marries
a
son
or
a
workman
son
the
capital
of
the
pair
will
soon
be
identical
so
much
love
if
they
are
lucky
enough
to
love
one
another
and
so
much
activity
if
they
are
intelligent
enough
not
to
be
idlers
deep
silence
fell
and
one
could
hear
the
faint
whirr
of
a
wings
as
it
flew
about
among
the
roses
so
mazelle
who
was
overwhelmed
ended
by
asking
is
the
advice
you
give
us
monsieur
le
according
to
you
we
can
accept
that
lucien
bonnaire
as
our
eh
yes
the
world
will
none
the
less
continue
peacefully
revolving
and
as
the
two
children
are
so
fond
of
one
another
it
is
at
least
certain
that
you
will
make
them
happy
gourier
had
hitherto
said
nothing
he
felt
ill
at
ease
at
being
called
upon
to
decide
such
a
question
he
whose
son
had
gone
off
to
live
with
that
wild
girl
of
the
rocks
whom
he
now
received
in
his
highly
respectable
home
at
last
an
avowal
of
his
embarrassment
escaped
him
true
the
best
thing
after
all
is
to
marry
them
when
their
parents
do
marry
them
the
young
people
take
themselves
off
and
get
married
as
they
fancy
ah
in
what
times
are
we
living
he
raised
his
arms
towards
heaven
and
chÃ¢telard
had
to
exercise
all
his
influence
to
prevent
him
from
falling
into
black
melancholy
gourier
old
age
following
on
a
somewhat
dissolute
life
was
full
of
stupor
he
constantly
fell
asleep
at
table
in
the
midst
of
conversation
even
whilst
walking
out
of
doors
with
the
resigned
air
of
a
once
terrible
employer
of
labour
whom
facts
had
vanquished
he
ended
by
saying
what
else
can
be
expected
after
us
the
deluge
as
many
of
our
class
now
say
we
are
done
for
it
was
at
this
moment
that
judge
gaume
arrived
much
behind
his
time
nowadays
his
legs
swelled
and
it
was
only
with
difficulty
that
he
could
walk
helping
himself
along
with
a
stick
he
was
nearly
seventy
and
was
awaiting
his
pension
full
of
secret
disgust
for
that
human
justice
which
he
had
administered
during
so
many
years
contenting
himself
the
while
with
strictly
applying
the
written
law
like
a
priest
who
no
longer
believes
but
is
sustained
solely
by
dogma
in
his
home
however
the
drama
of
love
and
betrayal
which
had
wrecked
his
life
had
pursued
its
course
stubbornly
and
pitilessly
the
disaster
which
had
begun
with
the
suicide
of
his
wife
had
been
completed
by
his
daughter
lucile
who
had
caused
her
husband
captain
jollivet
to
be
killed
in
a
murderous
duel
by
one
of
her
lovers
with
whom
she
had
afterwards
eloped
the
police
were
seeking
her
and
gaume
now
lived
alone
with
her
one
child
andrÃ©
a
delicate
affectionate
youth
of
sixteen
over
whom
he
watched
with
anxious
affection
sufficient
misfortune
had
fallen
he
felt
avenging
destiny
punishing
some
old
unknown
crime
must
go
no
further
yet
he
still
wondered
to
what
good
power
what
future
of
true
justice
and
faithful
love
he
might
guide
that
youth
in
order
that
his
race
might
be
renewed
and
at
last
win
happiness
on
being
questioned
by
mazelle
respecting
the
advisability
of
a
marriage
between
louise
and
lucien
bonnaire
judge
gaume
immediately
exclaimed
them
marry
them
particularly
if
they
feel
for
one
another
such
great
love
as
to
enter
into
contest
with
their
parents
and
to
pass
over
all
obstacles
love
alone
decides
happiness
then
he
regretted
like
an
avowal
that
cry
which
the
bitterness
of
his
whole
life
had
wrung
from
him
for
he
was
intent
on
preserving
during
his
last
days
his
wonted
mendacious
rigidity
of
demeanour
his
austerity
and
coldness
of
countenance
not
wait
for
abbÃ©
marle
he
resumed
met
him
just
now
and
he
begged
me
to
apologise
to
you
he
was
hastening
to
the
church
for
the
holy
vessels
in
order
to
take
extreme
unction
to
old
madame
jollivet
an
aunt
of
my
who
is
in
the
last
pangs
poor
abbÃ©
in
her
he
is
losing
one
of
his
last
penitents
he
had
his
eyes
full
of
tears
the
fact
that
the
clergy
is
being
swept
away
is
the
one
good
feature
of
what
is
happening
exclaimed
gourier
who
had
remained
a
devourer
of
priests
republic
would
still
be
ours
if
the
clergy
had
not
tried
to
take
it
from
us
it
was
they
who
urged
the
people
on
to
upset
everything
and
become
the
masters
but
chÃ¢telard
remarked
compassionately
abbÃ©
marle
it
grieves
me
to
see
him
in
his
empty
church
you
do
quite
right
madame
mazelle
in
still
sending
him
some
bouquets
for
the
virgin
silence
fell
again
and
the
tragic
shadow
of
the
priest
seemed
to
flit
by
in
the
bright
sunlight
amidst
the
perfume
of
the
roses
in
lÃ©onore
he
had
lost
his
dearest
and
most
faithful
parishioner
madame
mazelle
doubtless
remained
to
him
but
she
was
not
really
a
believer
all
that
she
sought
in
religion
was
something
ornamental
a
kind
of
certificate
that
she
was
a
and
the
abbÃ©
was
not
ignorant
of
his
destiny
he
would
some
day
be
found
dead
at
his
altar
under
the
remnants
of
his
church
which
threatened
ruin
but
which
for
lack
of
money
he
could
not
repair
neither
at
the
nor
at
the
was
there
any
fund
left
for
such
work
he
had
appealed
to
the
faithful
and
in
response
had
with
difficulty
obtained
a
ridiculously
small
sum
of
money
and
now
he
was
resigned
to
his
fate
he
awaited
the
fall
still
celebrating
the
offices
as
if
he
were
unaware
of
the
threat
of
annihilation
hanging
above
his
head
his
church
was
becoming
emptier
and
emptier
dying
a
little
more
each
day
and
he
would
die
also
when
the
old
structure
cracked
around
him
and
fell
crushing
him
beneath
the
weight
of
the
great
crucifix
which
still
hung
from
the
wall
and
they
would
have
one
and
the
same
grave
the
earth
whither
all
returns
as
it
happened
madame
mazelle
was
far
too
much
upset
by
her
personal
worries
to
take
any
interest
at
that
moment
in
the
dolorous
fate
of
abbÃ©
marle
if
there
should
not
be
a
prompt
solution
with
respect
to
the
marriage
she
feared
that
she
might
fall
seriously
ill
she
who
had
derived
so
many
hours
of
nursing
and
petting
from
the
malady
without
a
name
with
which
she
had
embellished
her
existence
all
her
guests
having
now
arrived
she
quitted
her
armchair
to
serve
the
tea
which
steamed
in
the
cups
of
bright
porcelain
whilst
a
sunray
gilded
the
little
cakes
lying
in
the
crystal
dishes
and
she
went
on
shaking
her
big
placid
head
for
she
was
not
yet
convinced
may
say
what
you
like
my
friends
but
that
marriage
would
really
be
the
last
blow
and
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
it
will
wait
declared
mazelle
will
exhaust
louise
patience
but
all
at
once
both
husband
and
wife
were
thunderstruck
for
louise
herself
stood
before
them
among
the
sunlit
roses
at
the
entrance
of
the
arbour
they
had
fancied
her
in
her
room
on
her
couch
suffering
from
that
which
according
to
doctor
novarre
contentment
alone
could
cure
no
doubt
she
had
guessed
that
the
others
were
deciding
her
fate
and
with
her
beautiful
black
hair
just
caught
up
in
a
knot
wearing
a
with
a
pattern
of
little
red
flowers
she
had
come
down
in
all
haste
quivering
with
the
passion
that
animated
her
she
looked
charming
with
her
somewhat
eyes
gleaming
in
her
slender
face
not
even
grief
could
entirely
extinguish
their
gay
sparkle
she
had
heard
the
last
words
spoken
by
her
parents
mamma
ah
papa
what
was
that
you
were
saying
she
cried
you
imagine
that
some
merely
childish
caprice
is
in
question
i
told
you
already
and
i
tell
you
again
i
wish
lucien
to
be
my
husband
and
so
he
shall
although
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
his
daughter
mazelle
still
tried
to
struggle
against
the
inevitable
just
think
of
it
you
unhappy
child
our
fortune
which
you
were
to
have
inherited
is
already
in
jeopardy
so
it
is
quite
possible
that
one
of
these
days
you
will
find
yourself
without
a
penny
he
said
understand
the
situation
remarked
madame
mazelle
in
her
turn
our
money
even
though
it
is
in
danger
you
might
still
make
a
sensible
marriage
then
louise
exploded
with
superb
joyous
vehemence
money
i
do
not
care
a
pin
for
it
i
you
can
keep
it
if
you
were
to
give
it
me
lucien
would
no
longer
take
me
as
his
wife
money
indeed
what
should
i
do
with
it
money
of
what
use
is
it
it
does
not
help
one
to
love
and
be
happy
lucien
will
earn
my
bread
for
me
and
i
earn
it
too
if
necessary
it
will
be
delightful
she
cried
these
things
aloud
with
such
strength
of
youth
and
hope
that
the
mazelles
fearing
for
her
reason
were
anxious
to
quiet
her
by
at
last
yielding
to
her
desires
besides
they
were
not
people
to
continue
battling
they
wished
to
end
their
days
in
peace
as
for
chÃ¢telard
mayor
gourier
and
judge
gaume
whilst
drinking
their
tea
they
smiled
with
some
embarrassment
for
they
felt
the
girl
free
love
sweeping
them
away
like
bits
of
straw
one
must
needs
consent
to
what
one
can
not
prevent
it
was
chÃ¢telard
who
summed
up
everything
in
his
amiable
bantering
way
the
irony
of
which
was
scarcely
perceptible
friend
gourier
is
right
we
are
done
for
since
it
is
our
children
who
make
the
laws
now
the
marriage
of
lucien
bonnaire
and
louise
mazelle
took
place
a
month
later
chÃ¢telard
for
his
personal
amusement
prevailed
on
his
friend
gourier
to
give
a
grand
ball
at
the
on
the
wedding
night
as
if
by
way
of
honouring
their
friends
the
mazelles
at
heart
he
thought
it
a
good
joke
to
make
the
of
beauclair
dance
at
this
wedding
which
became
a
symbol
of
the
multitude
accession
to
power
they
would
dance
on
the
ruins
of
authority
in
that
which
was
gradually
becoming
the
real
where
the
mayor
was
no
longer
anything
but
a
link
between
the
various
social
groups
the
hall
was
most
luxuriously
decorated
and
there
was
music
and
singing
as
at
the
wedding
of
nanet
and
nise
and
acclamations
once
more
arose
at
the
sight
of
the
bridal
pair
lucien
so
strong
and
sturdy
followed
by
all
his
mates
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
louise
so
slim
and
passionate
followed
by
all
the
fine
society
of
the
town
whose
presence
had
been
desired
by
her
parents
as
a
kind
of
supreme
protest
only
it
came
to
pass
that
the
fine
folk
were
swamped
by
the
multitude
won
over
to
the
rush
of
delight
carried
away
and
conquered
to
such
a
point
that
a
great
many
more
marriages
between
the
lads
and
girls
of
the
different
classes
ensued
once
more
then
love
triumphed
love
which
inflames
the
living
universe
and
bears
it
onward
to
its
happy
destiny
youth
flowered
on
all
sides
other
alliances
were
concluded
couples
which
everything
seemed
to
separate
set
out
together
for
the
future
city
of
happiness
the
old
trading
class
of
beauclair
now
on
the
point
of
disappearing
gave
its
daughters
and
sons
to
the
artisans
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
peasants
of
les
combettes
the
laboques
set
the
example
by
allowing
their
son
auguste
to
marry
marthe
bourron
and
their
daughter
eulalie
to
marry
arsÃ¨ne
lenfant
they
had
ceased
struggling
for
some
years
already
for
they
realised
that
the
trade
of
old
times
the
useless
cogwheel
which
had
consumed
so
much
energy
and
wealth
was
vanquished
and
dying
at
the
outset
they
had
been
obliged
to
allow
their
shop
of
the
rue
de
brias
to
be
turned
into
a
mere
of
the
articles
manufactured
at
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
other
syndicated
factories
then
taking
a
further
step
they
had
consented
to
close
the
shop
which
had
been
merged
into
the
general
stores
where
luc
indulgence
had
procured
them
an
inspectorship
by
way
of
occupation
and
now
old
age
had
come
and
they
lived
in
retirement
full
of
bitterness
and
scared
by
the
sight
of
that
new
world
which
evinced
none
of
their
own
passion
for
lucre
the
new
generations
had
grown
up
for
other
forms
of
activity
and
delight
than
moneymaking
and
thus
their
children
auguste
and
eulalie
yielding
to
love
the
great
artisan
of
harmony
and
peace
married
as
they
pleased
encountering
no
obstacle
on
their
parents
side
save
the
covert
disapproval
of
old
folk
who
regret
the
past
it
was
arranged
that
the
two
weddings
should
be
celebrated
on
the
same
day
at
les
combettes
now
a
large
township
a
very
suburb
of
beauclair
with
large
bright
buildings
redolent
of
the
inexhaustible
wealth
of
the
earth
and
the
weddings
took
place
at
indeed
on
the
very
last
day
of
the
harvesting
when
huge
ricks
already
arose
upon
every
side
over
the
great
golden
plain
feuillat
the
former
farmer
of
la
guerdache
had
already
married
his
son
lÃ©on
to
eugÃ©nie
daughter
of
yvonnot
the
assessor
whom
he
had
formerly
reconciled
with
feuillat
the
mayor
that
reconciliation
whence
had
sprung
the
good
agreement
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
and
that
impulse
to
combine
together
which
had
made
the
wretched
village
consumed
by
hatred
a
fraternal
and
flourishing
town
nowadays
feuillat
who
was
very
aged
had
become
like
the
patriarch
of
that
agricultural
society
for
it
was
he
who
had
dreamt
of
it
secretly
sought
to
establish
it
in
former
days
when
combating
the
deadly
system
and
foreseeing
what
incalculable
wealth
the
tillers
of
the
soil
might
draw
from
it
when
they
should
agree
together
to
love
it
like
men
of
science
and
method
a
true
love
for
that
soil
which
for
centuries
had
been
exhausting
his
ancestors
seemed
to
have
sufficed
to
enlighten
that
simple
farmer
who
originally
had
been
a
and
rapacious
man
like
all
of
his
class
he
had
perceived
in
what
direction
lay
salvation
peace
among
all
the
peasants
a
combination
of
efforts
the
earth
becoming
once
more
the
sole
mother
ploughed
sown
and
cropped
by
one
family
and
he
had
beheld
the
fulfilment
of
his
dream
he
had
seen
his
fields
joined
together
the
farm
of
la
guerdache
merged
into
the
parish
of
les
combettes
other
smaller
villages
joined
thereto
a
vast
estate
created
and
set
on
the
march
for
the
conquest
by
successive
annexation
of
the
whole
of
the
vast
plain
of
la
roumagne
feuillat
who
had
remained
the
soul
of
the
association
formed
with
lenfant
and
yvonnot
its
founders
a
kind
of
des
anciens
who
were
consulted
on
all
things
and
whose
advice
was
always
found
profitable
thus
when
the
wedding
of
lenfant
son
arsÃ¨ne
with
eulalie
laboque
was
decided
upon
and
the
latter
brother
auguste
determined
to
celebrate
his
marriage
with
marthe
bourron
at
the
same
time
it
occurred
to
feuillat
whose
idea
was
accepted
and
acclaimed
by
all
to
organise
a
great
which
should
be
like
the
festival
of
the
pacification
and
triumph
of
les
combettes
they
would
drink
to
fraternity
between
the
peasant
and
the
industrial
worker
formerly
so
bitterly
opposed
to
one
another
but
whose
alliance
alone
could
establish
social
wealth
and
peace
they
would
drink
also
to
the
end
of
all
antagonism
to
the
disappearance
of
that
barbarous
thing
called
trade
which
had
perpetuated
a
hateful
struggle
between
the
dealer
who
sold
a
tool
the
peasant
who
made
corn
grow
and
the
baker
who
sold
bread
at
a
price
increased
by
the
thefts
of
a
number
of
intermediaries
and
what
better
day
could
be
chosen
to
celebrate
the
reconciliation
than
that
when
the
enemies
of
former
days
the
castes
which
had
seemed
bent
on
devouring
and
destroying
one
another
ended
by
exchanging
their
lads
and
girls
consenting
to
marriages
which
would
hasten
the
advent
of
the
future
thus
it
was
decided
that
the
should
take
place
in
a
large
field
near
the
town
a
field
where
lofty
ricks
golden
under
the
bright
sun
arose
like
the
symmetrically
disposed
columns
of
some
gigantic
temple
the
colonnade
stretched
indeed
to
the
very
horizon
other
ricks
and
other
ricks
arose
proclaiming
the
inexhaustible
fruitfulness
of
the
soil
and
it
was
there
that
they
sang
that
they
danced
amidst
the
pleasant
odour
of
the
ripe
corn
amidst
the
great
fertile
plain
whence
the
work
of
man
now
at
last
reconciled
drew
bread
enough
for
the
happiness
of
all
the
laboques
brought
in
their
train
all
the
former
tradesmen
of
beauclair
whilst
the
bourrons
brought
the
whole
of
la
crÃªcherie
the
lenfants
were
there
at
home
and
never
yet
had
folk
fraternised
so
fully
the
groups
fast
mingling
and
uniting
in
one
sole
family
the
laboques
no
doubt
remained
grave
and
somewhat
embarrassed
but
the
lenfants
made
merry
with
all
their
hearts
whilst
the
great
sight
of
all
was
babette
bourron
whose
everlasting
good
humour
her
certainty
even
amidst
the
greatest
worries
that
things
would
turn
out
well
at
last
now
proved
triumphant
she
personified
hope
marching
radiant
behind
the
two
bridal
couples
and
when
these
arrived
marthe
bourron
on
the
arm
of
auguste
laboque
eulalie
laboque
on
the
arm
of
arsÃ¨ne
lenfant
they
brought
with
them
such
a
blaze
of
youth
and
strength
and
delight
that
endless
acclamations
rolled
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
stubbles
the
onlookers
called
to
them
affectionately
they
were
loved
they
were
praised
because
they
indeed
personified
sovereign
and
victorious
love
that
love
which
had
already
drawn
all
those
folk
together
by
giving
them
those
overflowing
harvests
amidst
which
they
would
henceforth
swarm
like
a
free
and
united
people
ignorant
alike
of
hatred
and
of
want
that
same
day
other
marriages
were
decided
upon
as
had
already
happened
at
the
wedding
of
lucien
bonnaire
and
louise
mazelle
madame
mitaine
the
former
bakeress
who
had
remained
for
everybody
the
madame
mitaine
in
spite
of
her
years
kissed
olympe
lenfant
sister
to
one
of
the
bridegrooms
and
told
her
that
she
would
be
happy
to
call
her
for
her
son
Ã©variste
had
confessed
that
he
adored
her
the
beautiful
bakeress
husband
had
been
dead
for
ten
years
and
her
establishment
had
been
merged
into
the
general
stores
of
la
crÃªcherie
as
was
the
case
with
most
of
the
retail
businesses
of
the
town
she
lived
like
a
retired
worker
with
her
son
Ã©variste
both
very
proud
of
the
fact
that
luc
had
given
them
the
charge
of
the
electrical
kneading
appliances
which
yielded
an
abundance
of
white
light
bread
whilst
Ã©variste
in
his
turn
was
bestowing
a
betrothal
kiss
on
olympe
who
had
turned
pink
with
pleasure
madame
mitaine
suddenly
recognised
in
a
thin
dark
little
woman
seated
beside
a
rick
her
old
neighbour
madame
dacheux
the
butcher
wife
she
thereupon
went
and
sat
down
beside
her
it
not
all
finish
in
weddings
she
asked
gaily
all
these
young
folk
were
ever
playing
together
madame
dacheux
however
remained
silent
and
gloomy
she
also
had
lost
her
husband
who
had
died
from
the
effects
of
a
badly
aimed
blow
with
his
chopper
which
had
struck
off
his
right
hand
according
to
some
folk
clumsiness
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
butcher
having
voluntarily
cut
off
his
hand
in
a
fit
of
furious
anger
rather
than
sign
a
transfer
of
his
shop
to
la
crÃªcherie
decent
occurrences
and
the
idea
that
holy
meat
the
meat
of
the
wealthy
was
now
being
placed
within
the
reach
of
all
and
appearing
at
the
tables
of
the
poorest
must
have
maddened
that
violent
reactionary
and
tyrannical
man
he
had
died
from
the
effects
of
gangrene
improperly
treated
leaving
his
wife
in
a
state
of
terror
from
the
oaths
which
he
had
heaped
upon
her
during
his
final
agony
your
julienne
how
is
she
madame
mitaine
inquired
in
her
amiable
way
met
her
the
other
day
she
looked
superb
the
butcher
widow
was
at
last
obliged
to
answer
pointing
to
a
couple
figuring
in
one
of
the
quadrille
sets
she
said
dancing
yonder
i
watching
her
julienne
indeed
was
dancing
on
the
arm
of
a
tall
fellow
louis
fauchard
the
son
of
the
former
drawer
sturdy
of
build
white
of
skin
her
whole
face
beaming
with
health
julienne
evidently
enjoyed
the
embrace
of
that
vigorous
yet
youth
who
was
one
of
the
best
smiths
of
la
crÃªcherie
does
that
mean
another
marriage
then
asked
madame
mitaine
laughing
but
madame
dacheux
shuddered
and
protested
no
no
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
you
know
what
my
husband
ideas
were
he
would
rise
from
his
tomb
if
i
let
our
daughter
marry
that
workman
the
son
of
that
wretched
mÃ©lanie
who
was
always
trying
to
get
a
bit
of
on
credit
and
whom
he
drove
out
of
our
shop
so
often
because
she
never
paid
in
a
low
and
tremulous
voice
the
butcher
widow
went
on
to
relate
what
a
torturing
life
she
led
her
husband
appeared
to
her
at
although
he
was
dead
he
still
made
her
bow
beneath
his
despotic
authority
tormenting
her
upbraiding
her
frightening
her
with
devilish
threats
in
her
dreams
the
poor
scared
insignificant
woman
was
so
unlucky
that
even
widowhood
had
not
brought
her
peace
i
were
to
let
julienne
marry
contrary
to
his
wishes
she
concluded
would
certainly
come
back
every
night
to
beat
me
she
was
shedding
tears
now
and
madame
mitaine
strove
to
comfort
her
assuring
her
that
she
would
soon
get
rid
of
her
nightmares
if
she
would
only
set
a
little
happiness
around
her
just
then
as
it
happened
mÃ©lanie
the
madame
fauchard
whom
for
years
one
had
seen
perpetually
running
about
to
procure
the
four
quarts
of
wine
which
her
husband
required
for
his
shift
drew
near
with
a
hesitating
step
she
no
longer
suffered
from
want
she
occupied
one
of
the
bright
little
houses
of
la
crÃªcherie
with
fauchard
who
infirm
and
stupefied
had
now
ceased
all
work
lodging
with
her
moreover
was
her
brother
fortunÃ©
now
years
of
age
and
already
an
old
man
and
deaf
owing
to
the
brutish
mechanical
uniform
toil
to
which
he
had
been
condemned
at
the
abyss
from
his
fifteenth
year
onward
thus
in
spite
of
the
comforts
which
la
fauchard
owed
to
the
new
pension
and
mutual
relief
system
she
had
remained
a
complaining
creature
a
wretched
waif
of
the
past
with
two
old
children
on
her
hands
therein
lay
a
lesson
an
example
of
the
shame
and
grief
which
the
had
brought
with
it
you
seen
my
men
she
asked
madame
mitaine
referring
to
her
husband
and
brother
lost
them
in
the
crowd
oh
there
they
are
with
halting
gait
by
way
of
propping
up
each
other
the
passed
by
fauchard
wrecked
and
done
for
suggesting
some
ghost
of
the
painful
toil
of
the
past
and
fortunÃ©
looking
less
aged
but
quite
as
downcast
stricken
seemingly
with
imbecility
through
all
the
sturdy
crowd
overflowing
with
new
life
and
hope
amidst
the
ricks
in
which
was
piled
the
corn
of
a
whole
community
the
two
unfortunate
men
strolled
hither
and
thither
freely
displaying
their
decrepitude
understanding
nothing
of
what
went
on
around
them
and
not
even
acknowledging
the
salutations
of
acquaintances
them
in
the
sunshine
it
does
them
good
resumed
madame
mitaine
addressing
la
fauchard
son
is
sturdy
and
gay
enough
true
louis
has
the
best
of
health
the
other
replied
sons
are
not
much
like
the
fathers
now
that
the
times
have
changed
just
see
how
he
dances
he
will
never
know
cold
and
hunger
thereupon
madame
mitaine
in
her
way
resolved
to
promote
the
happiness
of
the
young
couple
who
were
smiling
at
each
other
so
lovingly
whilst
they
danced
before
her
she
brought
the
two
mothers
madame
fauchard
and
madame
dacheux
together
and
made
them
sit
down
side
by
side
and
then
she
moved
the
butcher
widow
and
convinced
her
that
she
ought
to
consent
to
her
daughter
marriage
it
was
solitude
that
made
the
poor
old
creature
suffer
she
needed
grandchildren
to
climb
up
on
her
knees
and
put
all
troublesome
phantoms
to
flight
she
ended
by
exclaiming
agreeable
all
the
same
on
condition
that
i
not
left
alone
i
myself
never
said
no
to
anybody
it
was
who
would
have
it
but
if
you
all
wish
it
and
promise
to
defend
me
then
do
do
as
you
like
when
louis
and
julienne
learnt
that
their
mothers
consented
to
their
wedding
they
hastened
to
them
and
fell
in
their
arms
with
tears
and
laughter
and
thus
amidst
the
general
joy
fresh
joy
was
born
could
you
think
of
parting
these
young
people
madame
mitaine
repeated
seem
to
have
grown
up
one
for
the
other
i
given
my
Ã©variste
to
olympe
lenfant
whom
i
remember
as
quite
a
little
girl
when
she
used
to
come
to
my
shop
and
my
boy
gave
her
cakes
it
the
same
with
louis
fauchard
how
many
times
have
i
not
seen
him
prowling
near
your
shop
madame
dacheux
and
playing
with
your
julienne
the
laboques
the
bourrons
the
lenfants
and
the
yvonnots
whose
marriages
are
now
being
celebrated
why
they
all
grew
up
together
at
the
very
time
when
their
parents
were
attacking
one
another
and
now
you
see
their
harvest
time
has
come
she
laughed
yet
more
loudly
as
she
recalled
the
past
while
an
expression
of
infinite
kindness
spread
over
her
face
and
joy
was
rising
around
her
people
came
to
say
that
other
betrothals
had
just
taken
place
that
of
sÃ©bastien
bourron
with
agathe
fauchard
and
that
of
nicolas
yvonnot
with
zoÃ©
bonnaire
love
sovereign
love
was
incessantly
perfecting
the
reconciliation
blending
all
classes
together
and
the
lasted
until
until
the
stars
came
out
whilst
love
thus
triumphed
bringing
heart
nearer
to
heart
and
merging
one
into
another
amidst
the
dances
and
songs
of
those
joyous
people
marching
towards
future
unity
and
harmony
amidst
the
growing
fraternity
however
there
was
one
man
one
of
the
old
ones
morfain
who
remained
apart
from
all
the
rest
mute
and
wild
unable
and
unwilling
to
understand
he
still
dwelt
like
one
of
the
prehistoric
vulcans
in
the
rocky
cavity
near
the
smeltery
under
his
charge
and
now
he
was
quite
alone
there
like
a
who
had
broken
off
all
intercourse
with
the
rising
generations
when
his
daughter
had
gone
off
to
realise
her
dream
of
love
with
achille
gourier
the
prince
charming
of
her
blue
nights
morfain
had
already
felt
that
the
new
times
were
robbing
him
of
the
best
part
of
himself
then
another
love
affair
had
carried
away
his
son
that
tall
young
fellow
who
had
become
so
passionately
enamoured
of
honorine
a
quick
alert
little
brunette
daughter
of
caffiaux
the
grocer
and
taverner
morfain
had
at
first
peremptorily
refused
to
consent
to
their
marriage
full
of
contempt
as
he
was
for
that
shady
family
of
poisoners
the
caffiaux
who
on
their
side
returned
his
disdain
with
interest
and
in
their
vanity
were
by
no
means
inclined
to
allow
their
daughter
to
marry
a
worker
nevertheless
caffiaux
was
the
first
to
give
way
for
he
was
of
a
supple
and
crafty
nature
after
closing
his
tavern
he
had
secured
a
very
comfortable
post
as
chief
guardian
at
the
general
stores
of
la
crÃªcherie
and
the
nasty
stories
once
told
of
him
were
being
forgotten
whilst
for
his
part
he
feigned
too
much
devotion
to
the
principles
of
solidarity
to
cling
obstinately
to
a
decision
which
might
have
harmed
him
thus
carried
away
by
his
passion
took
no
further
notice
of
his
father
opposition
and
the
result
was
that
a
terrible
quarrel
a
frightful
rupture
between
the
two
men
ensued
from
that
time
forward
the
no
longer
spoke
save
to
direct
the
furnace
work
but
shut
himself
up
in
his
cavern
like
some
fierce
and
motionless
spectre
of
the
dead
ages
though
years
and
years
went
by
morfain
did
not
appear
to
age
he
was
always
the
same
conqueror
of
fire
a
colossus
with
a
huge
head
a
nose
like
an
eagle
beak
and
flaming
eyes
set
between
cheeks
which
a
flow
of
lava
seemed
to
have
ravaged
his
twisted
lips
now
seldom
parted
retained
their
tawny
redness
suggestive
of
burns
and
it
seemed
as
if
no
human
considerations
would
again
weigh
with
him
in
the
depths
of
the
implacable
solitude
in
which
he
had
shut
himself
on
perceiving
that
his
daughter
and
his
son
had
joined
the
party
of
had
presented
achille
with
a
sweet
little
girl
lÃ©onie
who
was
growing
up
all
grace
and
tenderness
and
wife
honorine
had
given
birth
to
a
strong
and
charming
boy
raymond
now
an
intelligent
young
man
who
would
soon
be
old
enough
to
marry
but
the
children
grandfather
did
not
soften
he
repulsed
them
shrank
even
from
seeing
them
on
the
other
hand
however
amidst
the
collapse
of
his
affection
for
his
kin
the
species
of
paternal
passion
which
he
had
always
evinced
for
his
furnace
seemed
to
increase
that
growling
monster
ever
afire
whose
flaming
digestion
he
controlled
both
day
and
night
was
seemingly
regarded
by
him
as
some
child
the
slightest
disturbance
in
its
work
threw
him
into
anguish
he
spent
sleepless
nights
in
watching
over
the
working
of
the
twyers
displaying
all
the
devotion
of
a
young
lover
amidst
the
embers
whose
heat
his
skin
no
longer
feared
luc
rendered
anxious
by
morfain
great
age
had
spoken
of
pensioning
him
off
but
renounced
the
idea
at
the
sight
of
the
quivering
rebellion
the
inconsolable
grief
which
was
displayed
by
that
hero
of
toil
who
was
so
proud
of
having
exhausted
consumed
his
muscles
in
pursuing
the
conquest
of
fire
however
the
hour
for
retirement
would
come
forcibly
from
the
inevitable
march
of
progress
and
luc
indulgently
decided
to
wait
awhile
morfain
had
already
felt
that
he
was
threatened
he
was
aware
of
the
researches
which
jordan
was
making
with
the
view
of
replacing
the
old
slow
barbarous
smeltery
by
batteries
of
electrical
furnaces
the
idea
that
one
might
extinguish
and
demolish
the
giant
pile
which
flamed
during
seven
and
eight
years
at
a
stretch
quite
distracted
the
and
he
became
seriously
alarmed
when
jordan
effected
a
first
improvement
by
burning
coal
at
the
mouth
of
the
pit
from
which
it
was
extracted
and
bringing
electricity
without
loss
to
la
crÃªcherie
by
cable
however
as
the
cost
price
still
remained
too
high
for
electricity
to
be
employed
for
smelting
ore
morfain
was
able
to
rejoice
over
the
futility
of
jordan
victory
during
the
ensuing
ten
years
each
fresh
defeat
which
fell
on
jordan
delighted
him
he
indulged
in
covert
irony
feeling
convinced
that
fire
would
never
suffer
itself
to
be
conquered
by
that
strange
new
power
that
mysterious
thunder
whose
flashes
were
not
even
visible
he
longed
for
his
defeat
the
annihilation
of
the
new
appliances
which
were
ever
being
constructed
and
improved
but
all
at
once
the
position
became
very
threatening
a
rumour
spread
that
jordan
had
at
last
completed
his
great
work
having
discovered
a
means
of
transforming
calorical
energy
direct
into
electrical
energy
without
the
help
of
mechanical
energy
being
required
that
is
the
steam
engine
that
cumbersome
and
costly
intermediary
was
suppressed
and
in
thiswise
the
problem
was
solved
the
cost
of
electricity
would
be
lowered
by
and
it
would
be
possible
to
employ
it
for
the
smelting
of
a
first
battery
of
electrical
furnaces
was
indeed
already
being
fitted
up
and
morfain
full
of
despair
prowled
fiercely
around
his
as
if
anxious
to
defend
it
luc
did
not
immediately
give
orders
for
its
demolition
he
wished
first
of
all
to
make
some
conclusive
experiments
with
the
battery
thus
during
a
period
of
six
months
the
work
went
on
in
both
forms
and
the
old
smelter
spent
some
abominable
days
for
he
now
realised
that
the
monster
in
his
charge
was
condemned
he
saw
it
forsaken
now
nobody
came
up
the
hill
to
see
it
whereas
the
inquisitive
thronged
around
those
electrical
furnaces
below
which
occupied
such
little
space
and
did
their
work
it
was
said
so
well
and
so
speedily
morfain
for
his
part
full
of
rancour
never
went
down
to
see
them
but
spoke
of
them
disdainfully
as
of
toys
for
children
was
it
possible
that
the
ancient
method
of
smelting
which
had
given
man
the
empire
of
the
world
could
be
dethroned
no
no
one
would
have
to
revert
to
those
giant
furnaces
which
had
burnt
for
centuries
without
ever
being
extinguished
and
alone
with
the
few
men
under
his
orders
who
remained
silent
like
himself
morfain
looked
down
contemptuously
on
the
shed
in
which
the
electrical
furnaces
were
working
and
still
felt
happy
at
when
he
was
able
to
set
the
horizon
all
aglow
with
a
of
dazzling
metal
but
the
day
at
last
came
when
luc
passed
sentence
on
the
whose
work
was
now
shown
to
be
both
slower
and
more
costly
than
the
other
thus
it
was
decided
that
following
upon
a
final
run
it
should
be
allowed
to
go
out
after
which
it
might
be
demolished
morfain
on
being
warned
of
this
did
not
answer
but
remained
impassive
his
bronze
countenance
revealing
nothing
of
the
tempest
in
his
soul
his
calmness
frightened
people
came
up
to
see
him
accompanied
by
her
daughter
lÃ©onie
and
moved
by
the
same
affectionate
impulse
brought
his
son
raymond
for
a
moment
the
family
found
itself
assembled
as
in
former
days
in
the
rocky
hillside
cavern
and
the
old
man
allowed
himself
to
be
kissed
and
caressed
without
repulsing
his
grandchildren
as
he
had
usually
done
still
he
did
not
return
their
caresses
but
seemed
far
away
like
one
who
belonged
to
a
past
period
one
in
whom
no
human
feeling
was
left
it
was
a
cold
and
gloomy
autumn
day
and
the
crapelike
veil
of
the
early
twilight
was
falling
from
a
livid
sky
over
the
dark
earth
at
last
morfain
arose
and
broke
the
silence
saying
they
are
waiting
for
me
there
is
yet
another
run
it
was
the
last
they
all
followed
him
to
the
the
men
under
his
orders
were
present
already
shadowy
in
the
increasing
gloom
and
once
again
for
the
last
time
the
usual
work
was
accomplished
a
bar
was
thrust
into
the
plug
of
refractory
clay
the
hole
was
enlarged
and
finally
the
tumultuous
flood
of
fusing
metal
poured
forth
a
stream
of
flames
rolling
along
the
channels
in
the
sand
and
filling
the
moulds
with
blazing
pools
and
once
again
too
from
those
tracks
and
fields
of
fire
arose
a
harvest
of
sparks
blue
sparks
of
delicate
ethereality
and
golden
fusees
delightfully
refined
a
florescence
of
cornflowers
as
it
were
amidst
golden
ears
of
wheat
and
a
blinding
glow
burst
on
the
mournful
twilight
illumining
the
furnace
the
neighbouring
buildings
the
distant
roofs
of
beauclair
and
the
whole
of
the
great
horizon
then
everything
disappeared
deep
night
reigned
all
around
the
end
had
come
the
furnace
life
was
over
morfain
who
without
a
word
had
stood
looking
at
it
all
remained
there
in
the
gloom
motionless
like
one
of
the
neighbouring
rocks
which
the
shades
of
night
again
enveloped
said
gently
that
there
is
no
more
work
to
be
done
here
you
must
come
down
to
us
your
room
has
long
been
ready
for
you
and
in
his
turn
exclaimed
you
certainly
got
to
rest
now
there
is
a
room
for
you
in
my
place
too
you
must
let
each
of
us
have
you
in
turn
you
must
live
sometimes
with
one
and
sometimes
with
the
other
but
the
old
did
not
immediately
answer
a
great
sigh
made
his
breast
heave
dolorously
at
last
he
said
it
i
go
down
i
have
a
look
but
you
can
go
away
now
for
another
fifteen
days
it
was
impossible
to
induce
morfain
to
quit
the
furnace
he
watched
it
cooling
as
one
watches
beside
a
every
evening
he
felt
it
in
order
to
make
sure
that
it
was
not
quite
dead
and
as
long
as
he
found
a
little
warmth
remaining
he
lingered
obstinately
beside
it
as
if
it
were
a
friend
whose
remains
it
would
be
wrong
to
abandon
but
at
last
the
demolishers
arrived
and
then
one
morning
the
grand
old
vanquished
man
was
seen
to
descend
from
his
cavern
to
la
crÃªcherie
where
he
repaired
with
a
still
firm
step
to
the
large
glazed
shed
in
which
the
battery
of
electrical
furnaces
was
working
as
it
happened
both
jordan
and
luc
were
there
with
whom
they
had
appointed
to
direct
the
smelting
in
conjunction
with
his
son
raymond
the
latter
already
being
a
good
electrician
the
work
was
being
brought
to
greater
precision
day
by
day
and
jordan
scarcely
quitted
the
shed
eager
as
he
was
to
perfect
the
new
method
which
had
cost
him
so
many
years
of
study
and
experiment
morfain
my
old
friend
he
exclaimed
joyously
you
become
sensible
the
other
face
the
colour
of
old
iron
remained
impassive
and
he
contented
himself
with
replying
monsieur
jordan
i
wanted
to
see
your
machine
luc
however
scrutinised
him
rather
anxiously
he
had
given
orders
to
have
him
watched
for
he
had
learnt
that
he
had
been
found
leaning
over
the
mouth
of
the
blast
furnace
when
the
latter
was
still
full
of
glowing
embers
like
a
man
preparing
to
fling
himself
into
that
frightful
hell
one
of
the
smelters
under
his
orders
however
had
saved
him
from
that
death
which
he
had
contemplated
perchance
as
a
last
gift
of
his
scorched
frame
to
the
monster
as
though
indeed
he
set
his
pride
in
dying
by
fire
after
loving
and
serving
it
so
faithfully
for
more
than
half
a
century
is
pleasant
to
find
you
still
inquisitive
at
your
age
my
good
morfain
said
luc
without
taking
his
eyes
from
him
just
examine
these
toys
the
battery
stretched
out
before
them
showing
ten
furnaces
ten
cubes
of
red
over
six
feet
high
and
nearly
five
feet
long
and
above
them
one
only
saw
the
powerful
electrodes
thick
cylinders
of
carbon
to
which
the
electric
cables
were
attached
the
operations
were
very
simple
an
endless
screw
worked
by
a
switch
served
the
ten
furnaces
bringing
the
ore
and
discharging
it
into
them
a
second
switch
set
up
the
current
the
arc
whose
extraordinary
temperature
of
two
thousand
degrees
sufficed
to
melt
almost
four
hundredweight
of
metal
in
five
minutes
and
it
was
only
necessary
to
turn
a
third
switch
for
the
platinum
door
of
each
oven
to
rise
up
and
for
a
kind
of
rolling
way
lined
with
fine
sand
to
start
off
on
the
march
and
receive
the
ten
pigs
each
of
four
hundredweight
and
carry
them
into
the
cool
air
outside
my
good
morfain
asked
jordan
with
the
gaiety
of
a
happy
child
do
you
think
of
it
then
he
told
him
of
the
output
those
toys
each
yielding
four
hundredweight
of
metal
every
five
minutes
could
turn
out
altogether
a
total
of
two
hundred
and
forty
tons
daily
if
they
were
allowed
to
work
ten
hours
at
a
stretch
this
was
a
prodigious
output
when
one
considered
that
the
old
burning
day
and
night
alike
could
not
supply
of
the
quantity
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
electrical
furnaces
were
seldom
kept
working
more
than
three
or
four
hours
and
the
advantage
was
that
they
could
be
lighted
and
extinguished
as
one
pleased
in
accordance
with
one
needs
whatever
quantity
of
raw
material
that
was
required
being
immediately
obtained
and
how
easily
they
worked
and
what
cleanliness
and
simplicity
there
was
as
the
electrodes
themselves
supplied
the
carbon
necessary
for
the
carburisation
of
the
ore
there
was
little
dust
the
gases
alone
escaped
and
the
quantity
of
slag
was
so
small
that
a
daily
cleaning
sufficed
to
get
rid
of
it
there
was
no
longer
any
need
of
a
barbarous
colossus
whose
digestion
caused
disquietude
nor
of
any
of
the
numerous
and
cumbersome
appendages
the
purifiers
the
heaters
the
blast
machinery
and
the
constant
current
of
water
with
which
it
had
been
necessary
to
surround
it
there
was
no
longer
any
fear
of
stoppages
or
cooling
down
nor
any
talk
of
demolishing
or
emptying
the
monster
whilst
still
ablaze
because
a
twyer
simply
went
wrong
loaders
watching
at
the
mouth
and
smelters
piercing
the
plug
and
broiling
in
the
flames
of
the

no
longer
required
to
be
on
the
alert
following
one
another
incessantly
with
day
and
night
shifts
the
battery
of
the
ten
electrical
furnaces
extending
over
a
surface
under
fifty
feet
in
length
and
some
sixteen
feet
in
width
was
at
its
ease
in
the
large
bright
glazed
shed
which
sheltered
it
and
three
children
would
have
sufficed
to
set
everything
going
one
at
the
switch
of
the
endless
screw
a
second
at
the
switch
of
the
electrodes
and
a
third
at
that
of
the
rolling
way
do
you
think
of
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
my
good
morfain
repeated
jordan
triumphantly
the
old
still
looked
at
the
furnaces
without
moving
or
speaking
night
was
already
at
hand
shadows
were
filling
the
shed
and
the
working
of
the
battery
with
its
gentle
mechanical
regularity
was
quite
impressive
cold
and
dim
the
ten
furnaces
seemed
to
slumber
whilst
the
little
cars
of
ore
moved
by
the
endless
screw

one
by
one
then
every
five
minutes
the
platinum
doors
opened
the
ten
white
jets
of
the
ten
blazed
upon
the
gloom
and
the
ten
pigs
flowery
with
cornflowers
amidst
ears
of
wheat
slowly
and
continuously
journeyed
off
on
the
rolling
way
however
who
hitherto
had
remained
silent
wished
to
give
some
explanations
and
pointing
to
the
thick
cable
which
descending
from
the
rafters
brought
the
current
to
the
furnaces
he
said
see
father
the
electricity
comes
along
that
cable
and
such
is
its
force
that
if
the
wires
were
severed
everything
would
be
blown
up
luc
whom
morfain
calmness
had
reassured
began
to
laugh
say
that
he
exclaimed
would
frighten
our
young
people
nothing
would
be
blown
up
only
the
imprudent
man
who
touched
the
wires
would
be
in
danger
besides
the
cable
is
a
strong
one
that
true
resumed
strong
wrist
would
be
needed
to
break
it
morfain
still
impassive
drew
near
to
reach
the
cable
he
simply
had
to
raise
his
hands
however
for
a
moment
longer
he
remained
there
motionless
nothing
on
his
scorched
face
revealing
what
his
thoughts
might
be
but
all
at
once
such
a
flame
shot
from
his
eyes
that
luc
again
felt
anxious
as
if
with
a
vague
presentiment
of
a
catastrophe
strong
wrist
you
say
morfain
at
last
exclaimed
making
up
his
mind
to
speak
let
us
see
my
lad
and
before
the
others
had
time
to
intervene
he
caught
hold
of
the
cable
with
his
hands
hardened
by
fire
and
as
strong
as
iron
pincers
and
he
bent
the
cable
and
broke
it
even
as
an
irritated
giant
might
break
the
string
of
some
child
toy
and
lightning
came
the
wires
met
and
a
mighty
dazzling
flash
burst
forth
then
the
whole
shed
was
plunged
into
darkness
amidst
which
one
heard
nought
but
the
fall
of
that
tall
old
man
who
dropped
all
of
a
piece
like
an
oak
felled
in
the
forest
lanterns
had
to
be
fetched
jordan
and
luc
utterly
distracted
could
only
pronounce
morfain
to
be
dead
whilst
shrieked
aloud
and
wept
stretched
upon
his
back
the
old
smelter
did
not
appear
to
have
suffered
he
lay
there
like
some
colossal
figure
of
old
iron
however
his
garments
were
smouldering
and
the
fire
had
to
be
put
out
doubtless
he
had
been
unwilling
to
survive
the
monster
that
of
which
he
had
been
the
last
fervent
worshipper
with
him
had
finished
the
first
battle
man
the
subduer
of
fire
the
conqueror
of
metals
bending
beneath
the
slavery
of
dolorous
toil
and
so
proud
of
that
long
and
overwhelming
labour
the
labour
of
humanity
marching
towards
future
happiness
as
to
make
it
a
title
of
nobility
he
had
even
shrunk
from
knowing
that
new
times
were
born
bringing
to
each
by
the
victory
of
a
just
apportionment
of
work
a
little
rest
a
little
gaiety
a
little
happy
enjoyment
such
as
hitherto
only
a
few
privileged
beings
had
tasted
deriving
it
from
the
iniquitous
suffering
of
the
greater
number
and
he
had
fallen
like
some
fierce
obstinate
hero
of
the
ancient
and
terrible
like
a
vulcan
chained
to
his
forge
a
blind
enemy
of
all
that
would
have
freed
him
setting
his
glory
in
his
servitude
and
regarding
the
possible
diminution
of
suffering
and
effort
as
mere
downfall
and
the
force
of
the
new
age
the
lightning
which
he
had
come
to
deny
and
insult
had
annihilated
him
and
now
he
slept
three
years
later
three
more
marriages
took
place
still
further
blending
the
classes
together
and
tightening
the
bonds
of
that
fraternal
and
peaceful
people
which
was
ever
and
ever
spreading

the
daughter
of
nanet
and
nise
a
delightful
little
blonde
in
all
the
flowery
springtide
of
her
eighteen
summers
and
the
blood
of
the
delaveaus
became
calmer
on
mingling
with
that
of
the
froments
and
josine
the
erstwhile
wretched
wanderer
who
had
been
picked
up
half
dead
of
starvation
almost
on

seventeen
the

two
years
and
this

the

was
allied
with
that
of
those

the
morfains
and
that
of

in
this
marriage
the
expiring
became
united
to
the

and

and

led
to
the
building
of
another
little
house
among
the
greenery
and
the
march
of
those
houses
never
ceased
old
beauclair
had
long
since
been
invaded
and
swept
away
the
ancient
leprous
district
the
filthy
hovels
where
labour
had
agonised
for
centuries
had
been
razed
to
the
ground
over
which
now
stretched
broad
roads
planted
with
trees
and
edged
with
smiling
dwellings
even
the
quarter
of
beauclair
was
threatened
the
piercing
of
new
streets
enabled
one
to
enlarge
and
turn
to
other
uses
the
old
public
edifices
such
as
the
the
law
courts
and
the
prison
the
ancient
church
alone
remained
cracking
and
crumbling
in
the
centre
of
a
small
deserted
square
which
suggested
a
field
of
nettles
and
brambles
on
all
sides
the
houses
where
people
had
lived
cooped
up
in
flats
had
given
place
to
healthier
dwellings
scattered
through
the
huge
garden
which
beauclair
was
becoming
each
of
them
gay
with
light
and
with
streaming
water
and
the
city
was
founded
a
very
great
and
very
glorious
city
whose
sunlit
avenues
ever
stretched
away
overflowing
already
into
the
neighbouring
fields
of
the
fertile
roumagne
iii
ten
more
years
went
by
and
love
which
had
united
so
many
couples
victorious
and
fruitful
love
brought
each
household
a
florescence
of
children
a
new
growth
going
towards
the
future
at
each
fresh
generation
a
little
more
truth
justice
and
peace
would
spread
and
reign
throughout
the
world
luc
who
was
already
years
old
evinced
with
increasing
age
a
livelier
a
keener
affection
for
children
now
that
he
saw
his
city
in
being
his
mind
went
out
to
the
rising
generations
to
them
he
gave
all
his
time
with
the
thought
that
the
future
rested
with
them
ripe
men
who
have
long
lived
amidst
certain
beliefs
and
habits
and
who
perchance
are
chained
to
the
past
by
atavism
can
not
be
altered
whereas
children
may
be
influenced
freed
from
false
ideas
helped
to
grow
and
progress
in
accordance
with
the
natural
inclination
towards
evolution
which
is
within
them
thus
during
the
visits
which
on
two
mornings
every
week
luc
continued
to
pay
to
his
work
he
devoted
most
of
his
attention
and
time
to
the
schools
and
the
where
the
very
little
ones
were
kept
he
began
by
inspecting
them
before
proceeding
to
the
workshops
and
the
stores
and
as
he
changed
his
visiting
days
every
week
he
generally
took
all
the
turbulent
young
people
by
surprise
one
tuesday
a
delightful
morning
in
spring
he
set
out
for
the
schools
at
about
eight
the
sunrays
were
scattering
golden
rain
amidst
the
young
greenery
and
as
luc
walked
slowly
down
one
of
the
avenues
past
the
house
where
the
boisgelins
resided
he
heard
a
voice
calling
him
it
was
that
of
suzanne
who
having
seen
him
passing
had
come
to
the
pray
come
in
for
a
moment
my
friend
said
she
poor
man
has
another
attack
and
i
feel
very
anxious
she
was
speaking
of
boisgelin
her
husband
as
his
idleness
made
him
feel
ill
at
ease
in
that
busy
hive
he
had
at
one
time
tried
to
work
and
luc
at
suzanne
request
had
given
him
a
kind
of
inspectorship
at
the
general
stores
but
the
man
who
has
never
done
anything
who
has
been
an
idler
from
birth
lacks
and
can
no
longer
bend
to
rule
or
method
thus
boisgelin
soon
found
that
he
was
incapable
of
following
any
continuous
occupation
his
mind
fled
his
limbs
ceased
to
obey
him
he
became
sleepy
overwhelmed
he
suffered
from
his
impotence
and
gradually
relapsed
into
the
emptiness
of
his
former
life
a
succession
of
idle
days
all
spent
in
the
most
futile
fashion
as
there
was
no
longer
any
round
of
pleasure
and
luxury
to
daze
him
he
sank
into
increasing
boredom
from
which
he
could
not
be
roused
he
was
spending
his
last
years
in
a
state
of
stupor
like
a
man
who
had
fallen
from
another
planet
amazed
at
the
unexpected
extraordinary
things
which
took
place
around
him
he
have
any
violent
fits
luc
inquired
of
suzanne
no
she
replied
simply
remains
very
sombre
and
suspicious
but
my
anxiety
comes
from
his
insane
fancies
having
taken
hold
of
him
again
it
seemed
indeed
that
boisgelin
mind
had
been
weakened
by
the
idle
life
he
led
in
that
city
of
activity
and
work
from
dawn
till
dusk
he
was
to
be
seen
wandering
like
a
pale
scared
phantom
about
the
bustling
streets
the
buzzing
schools
and
the
resounding
workshops
he
alone
did
nothing
whereas
all
the
others
busied
themselves
overflowing
with
the
delight
and
health
which
come
from
action
and
by
degrees
as
he
found
that
he
himself
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
work
amidst
that
nation
of
workers
the
insane
idea
seized
upon
him
that
he
was
the
king
the
master
and
that
this
nation
was
a
nation
of
slaves
working
solely
for
his
benefit
amassing
incalculable
wealth
which
he
would
dispose
of
as
he
pleased
for
his
sole
enjoyment
although
olden
society
was
crumbling
to
pieces
the
capitalist
idea
had
survived
in
him
and
he
remained
the
mad
capitalist
the
who
possessing
all
the
capital
of
the
earth
had
made
all
other
men
his
slaves
the
wretched
artisans
of
his
own
egotistical
happiness
luc
found
boisgelin
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
dressed
with
all
the
care
that
he
still
evinced
as
regards
his
personal
appearance
even
at
seventy
years
of
age
he
remained
a
coxcomb
always
well
groomed
freshly
shaved
and
wearing
that
distinctive
mark
of
conceit
a
single
eyeglass
his
wavering
glance
and
weak
mouth
alone
revealed
the
collapse
of
his
mind
at
that
moment
he
was
about
to
go
out
and
a
light
cane
was
in
his
hand
and
a
shiny
hat
was
tilted
over
his
ear
already
up
already
out
and
about
exclaimed
luc
affecting
a
manner
it
necessary
my
dear
fellow
replied
boisgelin
after
giving
him
a
suspicious
glance
deceives
me
how
can
i
sleep
in
peace
with
all
those
millions
which
my
money
brings
me
in
and
which
this
nation
of
workmen
earns
for
me
every
day
i
am
obliged
to
see
to
things
for
otherwise
there
would
be
a
leakage
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
every
hour
suzanne
made
a
sign
of
despair
then
addressing
luc
she
said
was
advising
him
not
to
go
out
what
is
the
use
of
worrying
like
that
but
her
husband
silenced
her
is
merely
money
that
worries
me
there
are
all
the
sums
piled
up
already
those
milliards
which
fresh
millions
increase
every
evening
i
quite
lose
myself
among
them
i
no
longer
know
how
to
live
in
the
midst
of
such
a
colossal
fortune
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
invest
it
manage
it
watch
over
it
in
order
to
save
myself
from
being
robbed
is
that
not
so
and
oh
it
hard
work
terribly
hard
work
and
makes
me
absolutely
wretched
more
wretched
even
than
the
poor
who
have
neither
fire
nor
bread
his
voice
had
begun
to
tremble
dolorously
and
big
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
he
looked
a
pitiable
object
and
although
he
generally
annoyed
luc
who
regarded
him
as
an
anomaly
in
that
industrious
city
the
other
was
now
stirred
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
said
he
can
at
least
take
a
day
rest
i
of
your
wife
opinion
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
out
i
should
stop
in
my
garden
and
watch
my
flowers
bloom
but
boisgelin
again
scrutinised
him
and
as
if
yielding
to
a
desire
to
confide
in
him
as
in
a
safe
friend
resumed
no
it
is
indispensable
that
i
should
go
out
what
bothers
me
even
more
than
exercising
supervision
over
my
men
and
my
fortune
is
that
i
do
even
know
where
to
put
my
money
just
think
of
it
there
are
milliards
and
milliards
they
end
by
becoming
an
encumbrance
no
rooms
are
built
big
enough
to
hold
them
and
so
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
have
a
look
round
and
try
to
find
some
pit
which
might
be
deep
enough
only
do
say
a
word
of
it
nobody
ought
even
to
suspect
it
then
as
luc
shuddering
and
terrified
turned
towards
suzanne
who
was
very
pale
and
scarce
able
to
restrain
her
tears
boisgelin
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
slip
out
of
the
garden
and
go
off
he
could
still
walk
rapidly
and
turning
down
the
sunlit
avenue
he
speedily
disappeared
luc
first
impulse
was
to
run
after
him
and
bring
him
back
by
force
assure
you
my
friend
he
said
to
suzanne
you
act
wrongly
in
letting
him
wander
about
i
can
never
meet
him
prowling
around
the
schools
or
through
the
workshops
and
stores
without
fearing
some
disaster
however
suzanne
strove
to
reassure
him
is
inoffensive
i
am
sure
of
it
she
said
i
sometimes
tremble
for
him
for
he
becomes
so
gloomy
beneath
the
burden
of
all
that
imaginary
money
of
his
that
a
sudden
impulse
to
have
done
with
it
all
is
to
be
feared
but
how
can
i
shut
him
up
he
is
only
happy
out
of
doors
and
to
place
him
in
confinement
would
be
useless
cruelty
especially
as
he
never
even
speaks
to
anybody
but
remains
as
wild
and
as
timid
as
a
truant
schoolboy
then
the
tears
which
she
had
been
restraining
flowed
forth
the
unhappy
man
he
has
caused
me
much
suffering
but
never
before
did
i
feel
so
grieved
on
learning
that
luc
was
going
to
the
schools
suzanne
resolved
to
accompany
him
she
also
had
aged
she
was
already
but
she
had
remained
healthy
and
active
ever
desirous
of
showing
her
interest
in
others
and
helping
on
good
work
and
since
she
had
been
living
at
la
crÃªcherie
and
had
had
nothing
more
to
do
for
her
son
paul
who
was
now
married
and
the
father
of
several
children
she
had
created
a
larger
family
for
herself
by
becoming
a
teacher
of
and
singing
for
some
of
the
youngest
pupils
in
the
schools
this
helped
her
to
live
happily
it
delighted
her
to
arouse
the
musical
instinct
in
those
little
children
she
herself
was
a
good
musician
but
after
all
her
ambition
was
not
so
much
to
impart
exceptional
science
to
them
as
to
render
their
singing
natural
like
that
of
the
warblers
of
the
woods
and
she
had
obtained
marvellous
results
there
was
all
the
sonorous
gaiety
of
an
aviary
in
her
class
and
the
young
ones
who
left
her
hands
afterwards
filled
the
other
classes
the
workshops
and
indeed
the
whole
town
with
perpetual
mirthful
melody
you
do
give
your
lesson
do
you
luc
inquired
i
only
want
to
profit
by
the
to
make
my
little
cherubs
rehearse
a
chorus
but
there
are
also
some
matters
for
me
to
consider
with
sÅurette
and
josine
the
three
women
had
become
great
and
indeed
inseparable
friends
sÅurette
had
retained
the
management
of
the
central
where
she
watched
over
the
very
little
ones
the
children
still
in
their
cradles
and
those
who
could
scarcely
walk
as
for
josine
she
directed
the
needlework
and
household
lessons
turning
all
the
girls
who
passed
through
the
schools
into
good
wives
and
mothers
well
able
to
manage
their
homes
in
addition
the
three
friends
formed
together
a
kind
of
council
which
looked
into
all
important
questions
concerning
women
in
the
new
city
luc
and
suzanne
following
the
avenue
at
last
reached
the
large
square
where
the
arose
surrounded
by
green
lawns
decked
with
shrubs
and
the
building
was
not
the
modest
pile
of
earlier
years
in
its
stead
there
had
been
erected
a
perfect
palace
with
a
long
polychromatic
faÃ§ade
in
which
decorated
stoneware
and
painted
faÃ¯ence
were
blended
with
ironwork
in
the
large
halls
erected
for
meetings
theatrical
performances
spectacular
displays
and
games
the
people
found
themselves
at
their
ease
at
home
as
it
were
they
frequently
fraternised
at
the
festivities
which
were
interspersed
among
the
days
of
work
if
the
little
houses
where
each
lived
as
he
listed
were
modest
ones
the
on
the
contrary
displayed
dazzling
luxury
and
beauty
such
as
was
appropriate
for
the
sovereign
abode
of
the
the
even
tended
to
become
a
town
in
the
town
so
frequently
was
it
enlarged
in
accordance
with
increasing
needs
other
buildings
too
arose
behind
it
libraries
laboratories
and
which
facilitated
free
study
research
experiment
and
the
diffusion
of
the
acquired
truths
there
were
also
courts
and
covered
buildings
for
athletic
exercises
without
mentioning
some
admirable
free
baths
flooded
with
the
fresh
and
pure
water
captured
on
the
slopes
of
the
bleuse
mountains
that
water
to
whose
inexhaustible
abundance
the
city
owed
its
cleanliness
health
and
gaiety
but
the
schools
especially
had
become
a
little
world
by
themselves
occupying
a
number
of
buildings
near
the
for
several
thousand
children
now
studied
in
them
to
avoid
all
unhealthy
crowding
numerous
divisions
had
been
arranged
each
occupying
its
own
pavilions
whose
large
bay
windows
overlooked
spacious
gardens
thus
the
whole
formed
as
it
were
a
city
of
childhood
and
youth
in
which
one
found
children
of
all
ages
from
infants
still
in
their
cradles
to
big
lads
and
lassies
who
were
completing
their
apprenticeships
after
passing
through
the
five
classes
in
which
education
proper
was
imparted
to
them
said
luc
with
his
kindly
smile
always
begin
at
the
beginning
i
always
go
first
to
see
those
little
friends
of
mine
who
are
still
being
suckled
of
course
replied
suzanne
smiling
also
will
go
in
with
you
in
the
first
pavilion
on
the
amidst
a
garden
planted
with
roses
sÅurette
reigned
over
a
hundred
cradles
and
as
many
she
also
watched
over
some
of
the
adjacent
pavilions
but
she
invariably
returned
to
this
one
which
sheltered
three
of
granddaughters
and
one
of
his
grandsons
of
whom
she
was
very
fond
luc
and
josine
knowing
how
the
city
benefited
by
the
rearing
of
the
children
together
had
set
an
example
in
this
respect
desiring
that
their
own
grandchildren
should
be
brought
up
with
those
of
others
as
it
happened
josine
was
in
the
pavilion
with
sÅurette
that
morning
the
former
was
now
and
the
latter
years
of
age
but
josine
retained
her
supple
gracefulness
and
fair
delicacy
beneath
her
beautiful
hair
whose
golden
hue
had
simply
paled
whilst
sÅurette
as
often
happens
with
plain
thin
dark
women
did
not
appear
to
age
but
seemed
to
acquire
with
advancing
years
a
particular
charm
derived
from
her
active
kindliness
and
persistent
youth
suzanne
now
was
the
elder
of
both
of
them
and
all
three
surrounded
luc
like
a
trio
of
faithful
hearts
one
the
loving
wife
and
the
others
devoted
friends
when
luc
went
in
with
suzanne
josine
was
holding
on
her
knees
a
little
boy
scarcely
two
years
old
whose
right
hand
sÅurette
was
examining
what
is
the
matter
with
my
little
olivier
asked
luc
already
feeling
anxious
he
hurt
himself
the
little
fellow
was
his
grandson
olivier
froment
the
child
of
his
eldest
son
hilaire
and
of
colette
the
daughter
of
nanet
and
nise
replied
sÅurette
is
merely
a
splinter
which
must
have
come
from
the
table
of
his
chair
there
it
out
now
the
boy
had
raised
a
slight
cry
of
pain
and
then
had
begun
to
laugh
again
while
a
little
girl
a
who
ran
about
in
all
freedom
hastened
up
with
open
arms
as
if
to
take
hold
of
him
and
carry
him
off
you
let
him
be
mariette
exclaimed
josine
full
of
alarm
must
not
turn
one
little
brother
into
a
doll
mariette
protested
declaring
that
she
would
be
very
good
and
josine
like
a
kind
grandmother
already
calmed
glanced
at
luc
and
the
pair
of
them
smiled
well
pleased
to
see
all
those
young
folk
who
had
sprung
from
their
love
around
them
however
suzanne
was
bringing
them
two
other
little
granddaughters
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
and
berthe
who
were
twins
in
their
fourth
year
their
mother
was
pauline
luc
second
daughter
now
the
wife
of
andrÃ©
jollivet
who
had
been
brought
up
by
his
grandfather
judge
gaume
after
the
captain
tragical
death
and
lucile
disappearance
of
their
five
children
luc
and
josine
had
already
married
three
hilaire
thÃ©rÃ¨se
and
pauline
whilst
the
two
others
charles
and
jules
were
as
yet
merely
these
darlings
you
were
forgetting
them
said
suzanne
gaily
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
and
berthe
the
twins
threw
their
arms
around
the
neck
of
their
grandfather
of
whom
they
were
extremely
fond
mariette
also
tried
to
climb
upon
his
knees
whilst
little
olivier
thrust
out
his
hands
which
no
longer
hurt
him
and
frantically
implored
grandpapa
to
take
him
on
his
shoulders
luc
half
stifled
by
caresses
began
to
jest
it
my
friend
you
have
now
only
to
fetch
maurice
your
nightingale
as
you
call
him
then
there
would
be
five
of
them
to
devour
me
good
heavens
what
shall
i
do
when
there
are
dozens
then
setting
the
twins
and
mariette
on
the
floor
he
took
hold
of
olivier
and
threw
him
up
into
the
air
at
which
the
child
raised
cries
of
rapturous
delight
be
reasonable
all
of
you
luc
resumed
when
he
had
set
the
boy
on
his
chair
again
ca
be
always
playing
you
know
i
must
attend
to
the
others
guided
by
sÅurette
and
followed
by
josine
and
suzanne
he
next
went
round
the
rooms
those
nurseries
of
the
little
folk
were
very
charming
with
their
white
walls
their
white
cradles
their
babes
in
white
a
universal
whiteness
which
seemed
so
gay
in
the
sunshine
which
streamed
through
the
lofty
windows
here
also
there
was
an
abundance
of
water
one
could
feel
its
crystalline
freshness
hear
its
murmur
as
if
indeed
clear
streams
were
flowing
through
the
place
ensuring
all
the
extreme
cleanliness
which
was
apparent
on
every
side
cries
occasionally
came
from
the
cradles
but
for
the
most
part
one
only
heard
the
pretty
prattle
the
silvery
laughter
of
those
who
could
already
walk
amongst
them
there
was
yet
another
little
community
a
silent
community
of
toys
dolls
horses
and
carts
all
leading
a
naÃ¯ve
and
comical
existence
and
these
were
the
property
of
one
and
all
of
both
the
boys
and
the
girls
who
mingled
like
members
of
one
sole
family
growing
up
together
from
their
cradles
and
destined
hereafter
to
live
side
by
side
now
as
brothers
and
sisters
now
as
husbands
and
wives
this
practice
of
bringing
up
the
children
of
both
sexes
together
had
already
yielded
good
results
among
the
young
married
couples
suzanne
noticed
a
happy
peacefulness
a
closer
blending
of
intelligence
and
sentiment
something
resembling
fraternity
in
love
and
in
the
schools
she
observed
that
the
presence
of
the
sexes
side
by
side
aroused
a
new
spirit
of
emulation
imparting
gentleness
to
the
boys
decision
to
the
girls
and
preparing
both
for
a
more
perfect
intermingling
of
natures
in
such
wise
that
they
would
become
one
joint
spirit
at
the
family
hearth
nothing
of
that
which
some
had
feared
had
taken
place
on
the
contrary
the
moral
level
was
higher
than
formerly
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
those
lads
and
girls
seek
the
studies
which
might
prove
most
useful
to
them
in
accordance
with
the
liberty
which
was
granted
to
each
pupil
to
work
out
his
or
her
future
in
conformity
with
individual
taste
are
virtually
betrothed
in
their
cradles
said
suzanne
jestingly
divorce
is
done
away
with
for
they
know
one
another
too
well
to
select
either
wife
or
husband
lightly
but
come
my
dear
luc
playtime
has
begun
and
i
want
you
to
hear
my
pupils
sing
sÅurette
remained
with
her
little
folk
for
it
was
also
the
time
when
some
of
them
took
their
baths
and
josine
for
her
part
had
to
go
into
her
needlework
ward
where
several
of
the
little
girls
preferred
to
spend
their
in
learning
to
make
dresses
for
their
dolls
thus
luc
alone
followed
suzanne
down
the
covered
gallery
into
which
opened
the
five
it
had
long
since
been
necessary
to
subdivide
the
classes
provide
more
spacious
buildings
and
even
enlarge
the
dependencies
the
gymnasiums
the
apprenticeship
workshops
and
the
gardens
into
which
the
children
were
turned
in
all
liberty
every
two
hours
after
a
few
trials
a
definite
system
of
education
had
been
arrived
at
and
this
system
which
rendered
study
attractive
by
leaving
the
pupil
all
his
personality
and
only
requiring
of
him
attention
to
such
lessons
as
he
preferred
as
he
freely
chose
yielded
admirable
results
providing
the
city
each
year
with
a
new
generation
that
tended
more
and
more
towards
truth
and
justice
this
was
indeed
the
only
good
way
to
hasten
the
future
to
create
such
men
as
might
be
entrusted
with
the
realisation
of
free
from
all
lying
dogmas
reared
amidst
the
necessary
realities
of
life
and
won
over
to
proven
scientific
facts
and
now
that
the
new
system
worked
so
well
nothing
seemed
more
logical
or
more
profitable
than
to
abstain
from
bending
a
whole
class
beneath
the
rod
of
some
master
who
would
have
tried
to
impose
his
personal
views
upon
some
fifty
pupils
of
varying
disposition
and
sensibility
it
seemed
indeed
quite
natural
that
one
should
simply
awaken
a
desire
to
learn
among
those
pupils
then
direct
them
on
their
journey
of
discovery
and
favour
the
individual
faculties
which
each
might
display
the
five
classes
had
thus
become
experimental
grounds
where
the
children
gradually
explored
the
field
of
human
knowledge
not
to
devour
that
knowledge
gluttonously
without
digesting
any
of
it
but
to
awaken
individual
intellect
assimilate
knowledge
in
accordance
with
personal
comprehension
and
in
particular
make
sure
of
one
specialities
luc
and
suzanne
had
to
wait
another
moment
for
the
school
work
to
cease
from
the
covered
gallery
they
were
able
to
glance
into
the
large
where
each
pupil
had
his
or
her
little
table
and
chair
long
tables
and
forms
had
been
discarded
and
the
new
system
made
the
pupil
feel
as
if
he
were
virtually
his
own
master
but
how
gay
was
the
sight
of
all
these
lads
and
girls
mingled
together
promiscuously
and
with
what
deep
attention
they
listened
to
the
professor
who
went
from
one
to
another
teaching
in
a
conversational
manner
and
at
times
even
provoking
contradiction
as
there
were
no
longer
any
punishments
or
prizes
the
children
set
their
budding
desire
for
glory
in
competing
together
as
to
who
could
best
show
that
he
or
she
had
understood
some
knotty
point
it
often
happened
that
the
professor
ceased
speaking
to
listen
to
those
whom
he
guessed
to
be
full
of
the
subject
and
the
lesson
then
acquired
all
the
interest
of
a
discussion
indeed
one
of
the
chief
objects
that
the
masters
had
in
view
was
to
put
life
into
the
studies
to
draw
the
pupils
from
inanimate
books
to
make
them
cognisant
of
living
things
and
impart
to
them
the
passion
of
ideas
and
pleasure
was
born
of
it
all
the
pleasure
of
learning
and
knowing
and
through
the
five
classes
was
spread
the
of
human
knowledge
the
real
stirring
drama
of
the
world
which
each
of
us
ought
to
know
if
he
wishes
to
take
part
in
it
and
find
happiness
in
its
midst
but
a
joyous
clamour
arose
playtime
had
come
round
every
two
hours
the
gardens
were
invaded
by
a
rush
of
boys
and
girls
fraternising
together
a
sturdy
lad
some
nine
years
old
ran
up
and
flung
himself
in
luc
arms
exclaiming
morning
grandfather
this
was
maurice
the
son
of
thÃ©rÃ¨se
froment
who
had
married
raymond
morfain
said
suzanne
gaily
my
nightingale
come
children
shall
we
repeat
our
pretty
chorus
on
that
lawn
between
those
big
chestnut
trees
quite
a
band
already
surrounded
her
among
a
score
of
others
there
were
two
boys
and
a
girl
whom
luc
kissed
of
the
former
one
was
ludovic
boisgelin
a
lad
eleven
years
old
the
son
of
paul
boisgelin
and
antoinette
bonnaire
whose
marriage
had
first
announced
the
fusion
of
the
classes
then
there
was
fÃ©licien
bonnaire
now
fourteen
the
son
of
sÃ©verin
bonnaire
and
lÃ©onie
gourier
the
daughter
of
achille
and
whose
love
had
flowered
among
the
wild
perfumed
rocks
of
the
bleuse
mountains
and
the
girl
was
germaine
yvonnot
a
granddaughter
of
auguste
laboque
and
marthe
bourron
a
handsome
laughing
girl
she
was
and
in
her
one
found
blended
the
blood
of
workman
peasant
and
petty
trader
who
had
so
long
warred
one
against
the
other
it
amused
luc
to
unravel
the
intricate
skeins
of
those
alliances
those
frequent
crossings
of
the
race
and
he
was
skilful
in
identifying
the
young
faces
whose
endless
increase
enraptured
him
but
suzanne
spoke
shall
hear
them
she
said
is
a
hymn
to
the
rising
sun
a
salute
on
the
part
of
childhood
to
the
planet
which
will
ripen
the
crops
some
fifty
children
assembled
together
on
the
lawn
amidst
the
chestnut
trees
and
the
chant
arose
very
fresh
pure
and
gay
there
was
no
great
musical
science
in
it
it
was
merely
a
series
of
couplets
sung
by
a
girl
and
a
boy
alternately
and
emphasised
by
choral
repetition
but
it
was
so
lively
so
expressive
of
naÃ¯ve
faith
in
the
planet
of
light
and
kindliness
that
it
possessed
a
stirring
charm
as
sung
by
those
young
and
somewhat
shrill
voices
for
his
part
maurice
morfain
the
little
boy
who
replied
to
germaine
yvonnot
the
girl
possessed
even
as
suzanne
had
said
an
angel
voice
of
crystalline
lightness
rising
to
the
most
delightful
notes
and
the
suggested
the
warbling
and
chirruping
of
birds
in
freedom
on
the
branches
nothing
could
have
been
more
amusing
luc
laughed
like
a
grandpapa
and
maurice
full
of
pride
again
rushed
into
his
arms
it
true
my
lad
said
luc
sing
like
a
little
nightingale
and
do
you
know
that
is
very
nice
because
in
life
you
see
you
will
be
able
to
sing
in
your
hours
of
worry
and
your
songs
will
bring
back
your
courage
one
ought
never
to
weep
one
ought
always
to
sing
is
what
i
tell
them
exclaimed
suzanne
everybody
ought
to
sing
and
i
teach
them
in
order
that
they
may
sing
here
and
in
studying
and
in
their
workshops
and
afterwards
throughout
their
lives
the
nation
that
sings
is
a
nation
of
health
and
gaiety
she
displayed
no
severity
nor
vanity
in
the
lessons
which
she
gave
in
this
fashion
amidst
the
garden
greenery
her
only
ambition
was
to
open
those
young
souls
to
the
mirth
of
fraternal
song
and
the
clear
beauty
of
harmony
as
she
expressed
it
whenever
the
day
of
universal
justice
and
peace
should
dawn
the
whole
happy
city
would
sing
beneath
the
sun
my
little
friends
she
exclaimed
again
and
carefully
in
time
there
is
no
occasion
to
hurry
once
again
the
chant
arose
but
towards
the
finish
of
it
the
young
vocalists
were
disturbed
a
man
appeared
amidst
some
shrubbery
behind
the
chestnut
trees
a
man
who
furtively
turned
round
as
if
to
hide
himself
luc
however
perceived
that
it
was
boisgelin
and
was
greatly
surprised
by
the
maniac
strange
behaviour
for
he
stooped
and
explored
the
grass
as
if
seeking
some
some
secret
cavity
at
last
luc
understood
the
meaning
of
it
the
poor
fellow
was
looking
for
some
nook
where
he
might
store
away
his
incalculable
wealth
in
order
that
it
might
not
be
stolen
from
him
he
was
often
met
behaving
in
this
wild
way
trembling
with
fear
at
a
loss
where
he
might
bury
all
that
surplus
fortune
the
weight
of
which
bowed
him
down
luc
shuddered
with
pity
at
the
sight
and
became
yet
more
concerned
when
he
perceived
that
the
children
were
alarmed
by
the
apparition
even
like
a
party
of
gay
chaffinches
put
to
flight
by
the
wild
fluttering
of
some
however
suzanne
who
had
turned
somewhat
pale
repeated
in
a
louder
voice
time
keep
time
my
dears
bring
out
the
last
bar
with
all
your
fervour
haggard
and
suspicious
boisgelin
had
disappeared
like
a
black
shadow
vanishing
from
amidst
the
flowering
shrubs
and
as
soon
as
the
children
recovering
their
composure
had
saluted
the
sovereign
sun
with
a
last
joyful
cry
luc
and
suzanne
complimented
them
on
their
efforts
and
dismissed
them
to
their
play
then
they
walked
together
towards
the
apprenticeship
workshops
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
you
see
him
suzanne
asked
in
a
low
voice
after
a
silence
the
unhappy
man
how
anxious
he
makes
me
but
as
luc
thereupon
expressed
his
regret
that
he
had
been
unable
to
follow
boisgelin
and
take
him
home
again
she
once
more
protested
he
would
not
have
followed
you
you
would
have
had
to
struggle
with
him
and
there
would
have
been
quite
a
scandal
my
only
fear
i
repeat
it
to
you
is
that
he
may
be
found
some
day
in
a
pit
with
his
head
broken
they
relapsed
into
silence
for
they
were
now
reaching
the
workshops
a
good
many
pupils
spent
a
part
of
their
playtime
there
planing
wood
filing
iron
sewing
or
embroidering
whilst
others
who
reigned
over
a
neighbouring
strip
of
ground
busied
themselves
with
digging
sowing
and
weeding
and
now
luc
and
suzanne
again
met
josine
standing
in
a
large
room
where
sewing
knitting
and
weaving
machines
placed
side
by
side
were
worked
sometimes
by
girls
and
sometimes
by
boys
here
again
several
of
the
children
were
singing
and
a
joyous
spirit
of
emulation
seemed
to
animate
the
workshop
you
hear
them
exclaimed
suzanne
whose
gaiety
had
returned
will
always
sing
those
warblers
of
mine
josine
was
explaining
to
a
big
girl
of
sixteen
named
clÃ©mentine
bourron
the
manner
in
which
she
ought
to
manage
a
in
order
to
do
certain
embroidery
whilst
another
pupil
a
girl
of
nine
aline
boisgelin
by
name
was
waiting
to
be
shown
how
she
ought
to
turn
down
a
seam
clÃ©mentine
was
the
daughter
of
sÃ©bastien
bourron
and
agathe
fauchard
her
grandfather
on
her
mother
side
being
fauchard
the
old
drawer
of
the
abyss
and
on
her
father
bourron
the
puddler
aline
who
was
a
younger
sister
of
ludovic
the
son
of
paul
boisgelin
and
antoinette
bonnaire
laughed
affectionately
when
she
perceived
her
grandmother
suzanne
who
was
very
fond
of
her
grandmamma
said
she
ca
turn
my
seams
down
very
well
as
yet
but
i
sew
them
very
straight
do
i
friend
josine
suzanne
kissed
her
then
watched
josine
who
turned
down
a
seam
to
serve
as
a
pattern
for
the
child
luc
himself
took
an
interest
in
these
little
matters
aware
as
he
was
that
everything
has
its
importance
that
happy
life
depends
upon
the
happy
employment
of
one
hours
then
as
sÅurette
came
up
at
the
moment
when
he
was
about
to
quit
josine
and
suzanne
in
order
to
repair
to
the
works
he
found
himself
for
a
moment
in
the
flower
garden
with
the
three
women
those
three
loving
and
devoted
hearts
that
helped
him
so
powerfully
to
bring
about
the
fulfilment
of
his
dream
of
goodness
and
happiness
they
surrounded
him
like
symbols
of
the
affectionate
solidarity
the
universal
love
which
he
wished
to
disseminate
among
mankind
taking
each
other
by
the
hand
they
stood
there
smiling
at
him
old
no
doubt
with
their
white
hair
but
still
beautiful
with
the
wondrous
beauty
of
kindliness
and
when
after
discussing
some
details
of
organisation
with
them
luc
departed
going
towards
the
works
their
loving
eyes
long
followed
his
footsteps
the
factory
halls
and
workshops
which
were
now
much
more
extensive
than
formerly
were
full
of
the
healthy
gaiety
which
comes
from
an
abundance
of
sunshine
and
air
on
all
sides
fresh
water
washed
the
cement
pavement
carrying
off
the
slightest
particles
of
dust
in
such
wise
that
the
abode
of
work
once
so
grimy
muddy
and
pestilential
now
shone
with
cleanliness
most
of
the
work
too
was
now
performed
by
machines
which
stood
around
in
serried
array
like
an
army
of
docile
indefatigable
artisans
ever
ready
for
the
effort
required
of
them
if
their
metal
arms
wore
out
they
simply
had
to
be
replaced
they
themselves
did
not
know
what
pain
was
and
they
had
in
part
suppressed
human
pain
they
too
were
friendly
machines
not
the
machines
of
the
earlier
days
the
competitors
which
aggravated
the
workman
want
by
producing
a
fall
in
wages
but
liberating
machines
universal
tools
toiling
for
man
whilst
man
rested
around
those
sturdy
workers
propelled
by
electricity
there
were
only
so
many
drivers
and
watchers
whose
sole
duties
consisted
in
moving
levers
or
switches
and
in
making
sure
that
the
mechanism
acted
properly
the
working
day
did
not
exceed
four
hours
and
a
workman
never
spent
more
than
two
upon
one
task
being
relieved
at
the
expiration
of
his
two
hours
by
a
mate
whilst
he
himself
passed
to
some
other
form
of
work
industrial
art
agriculture
or
public
function
again
the
general
employment
of
electric
power
had
virtually
done
away
with
the
uproar
with
which
the
workshops
had
once
resounded
and
now
they
were
enlivened
by
the
songs
of
the
workmen
the
vocal
mirth
which
the
latter
had
brought
from
their
schools
like
a
florescence
of
harmony
embellishing
their
whole
lives
and
the
singing
of
those
men
around
that
silent
machinery
at
once
so
powerful
and
so
easy
to
manage
proclaimed
the
delight
of
just
glorious
and
work
as
luc
passed
through
the
hall
containing
the
puddling
furnaces
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
exchange
a
few
friendly
words
with
a
strong
young
man
of
twenty
or
thereabouts
who
managed
one
of
those
furnaces
without
any
need
of
assistance
adolphe
are
things
going
on
satisfactorily
are
you
satisfied
luc
inquired
certainly
they
are
i
just
completed
my
two
hours
and
the
bloom
is
just
fit
for
removal
adolphe
was
a
son
of
auguste
laboque
and
marthe
bourron
unlike
his
maternal
grandfather
bourron
the
puddler
who
had
now
retired
he
did
not
have
to
perform
the
terrible
task
of
stirring
the
ball
of
fusing
metal
with
a
long
bar
amidst
all
the
flaring
of
the
fire
the
stirring
was
now
performed
by
mechanical
means
and
indeed
an
ingenious
contrivance
brought
the
dazzling
ball
out
of
the
furnace
and
placed
it
on
the
chariot
which
carried
it
to
the
helve
hammer
without
the
workman
having
to
intervene
shall
see
adolphe
gaily
resumed
of
quality
and
the
work
so
easy
he
lowered
a
lever
a
door
opened
and
the
ball
like
some
planet
setting
the
horizon
aglow
with
its
luminous
trail
slid
down
to
the
chariot
whilst
the
young
man
continued
smiling
without
a
drop
of
perspiration
appearing
on
his
brow
his
limbs
remaining
nimble
and
supple
undeformed
by
excessive
toil
the
chariot
had
already
started
off
to
deposit
its
burden
under
the
hammer
one
of
a
new
pattern
worked
by
electricity
and
doing
everything
that
had
to
be
done
by
itself
without
need
of
any
smith
to
turn
the
lump
over
now
upon
this
side
and
now
upon
that
and
the
hammer
also
worked
so
easily
and
the
sound
it
gave
out
was
so
clear
and
light
that
it
became
like
a
musical
accompaniment
to
the
mirth
of
the
workmen
must
make
haste
said
adolphe
again
after
washing
his
hands
have
to
finish
a
table
in
which
i
greatly
interested
and
i
shall
do
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
carpenters
workshop
he
was
indeed
a
carpenter
as
well
as
a
puddler
having
learnt
various
callings
like
all
the
young
folk
of
his
age
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
brutified
by
clinging
to
some
particular
specialty
varied
in
this
manner
work
became
both
delight
and
recreation
amuse
yourself
cried
luc
sharing
his
delight
yes
thanks
monsieur
luc
that
the
right
thing
to
say
good
work
good
amusement
one
spot
where
luc
spent
a
few
enjoyable
minutes
on
the
mornings
when
he
visited
the
works
was
the
hall
where
the
crucible
furnaces
were
installed
he
there
felt
himself
to
be
far
indeed
from
the
old
hall
at
the
abyss
that
hall
with
its
glowing
pits
growling
like
volcanoes
whence
the
wretched
workers
amidst
a
blaze
of
fire
had
to
lift
at
arm
length
their
hundred
pounds
weight
of
fusing
metal
instead
of
the
grimy
filthy
place
there
was
now
a
spacious
gallery
having
broad
windows
through
which
the
sunshine
streamed
and
a
pavement
of
large
slabs
between
which
opened
batteries
of
symmetrically
disposed
furnaces
as
electricity
was
employed
to
work
them
they
remained
cold
silent
clean
and
bright
and
here
again
mechanical
appliances
performed
all
the
work
lowered
the
crucibles
lifted
them
all
aglow
and
emptied
them
into
moulds
under
the
eyes
of
the
men
directing
them
women
were
even
employed
in
this
department
attending
to
the
distribution
of
the
electric
power
for
it
had
been
noticed
that
they
displayed
more
care
and
precision
than
men
in
working
the
delicate
appliances
luc
walked
up
to
a
tall
and
girl
of
twenty
laure
fauchard
daughter
of
louis
fauchard
and
julienne
dacheux
who
standing
near
one
apparatus
was
carefully
directing
the
current
towards
one
of
the
furnaces
in
accordance
with
the
indications
of
a
young
workman
who
on
his
side
watched
the
progress
of
the
fusion
laure
you
are
not
tired
are
you
luc
asked
her
no
monsieur
luc
it
amuses
me
how
can
i
get
tired
from
merely
turning
this
little
switch
the
young
workman
hippolyte
mitaine
who
was
now
nearly
had
drawn
near
he
was
the
son
of
Ã©variste
mitaine
and
olympe
lenfant
and
was
reported
to
be
betrothed
to
laure
fauchard
luc
said
he
you
would
like
to
see
some
billets
cast
we
are
ready
the
machinery
on
being
started
quietly
and
easily
removed
the
incandescent
crucibles
and
then
emptied
them
into
the
moulds
which
another
mechanism
brought
forward
in
turn
in
five
minutes
whilst
the
young
man
and
the
girl
looked
on
the
work
was
properly
performed
and
the
furnace
was
ready
to
receive
yet
another
charge
exclaimed
laure
laughing
i
think
of
all
the
terrible
stories
which
my
poor
grandfather
fauchard
used
to
tell
me
when
i
was
a
child
i
can
hardly
believe
them
he
had
got
much
of
his
wits
left
and
he
related
things
about
his
old
calling
as
a
drawer
that
were
fit
to
make
one
shudder
it
was
as
if
he
had
spent
his
life
in
the
midst
of
a
fire
with
the
flames
licking
his
limbs
all
the
old
folk
think
us
very
happy
nowadays
luc
had
become
grave
and
emotion
moistened
his
eyes
yes
said
he
grandfathers
suffered
a
great
deal
and
that
is
why
the
grandchildren
enjoy
a
better
life
work
well
and
love
one
another
well
the
lives
of
your
sons
and
daughters
will
be
better
still
then
luc
resumed
his
round
and
wherever
he
repaired
throughout
those
spacious
works
he
found
the
same
healthy
cleanliness
the
same
tuneful
gaiety
the
same
easy
and
attractive
work
thanks
to
the
variety
of
the
duties
entrusted
to
the
staff
and
the
sovereign
help
of
the
machinery
the
worker
was
no
longer
an
overpowered
beast
of
burden
held
in
contempt
with
freedom
he
had
recovered
conscience
and
intelligence
as
luc
concluded
his
inspection
in
the
hall
where
the
had
its
place
near
the
puddling
furnaces
he
again
paused
to
say
a
few
friendly
words
to
a
young
man
about
years
of
age
who
was
just
arriving
monsieur
luc
was
the
reply
come
from
les
combettes
where
i
been
helping
my
father
there
was
some
sowing
to
finish
so
i
did
two
hours
at
it
over
yonder
and
now
i
mean
to
do
another
two
hours
here
for
there
is
an
urgent
order
for
some
rails
the
young
man
was
named
alexandre
and
was
a
son
of
lÃ©on
feuillat
and
eugÃ©nie
yvonnot
gifted
with
a
lively
fancy
he
amused
himself
after
completing
his
regular
work
by
preparing
ornamental
designs
for
lange
the
potter
however
he
had
already
set
himself
to
his
task
which
was
the
superintendence
of
a
train
of
rollers
for
the
making
of
rails
luc
who
felt
very
happy
looked
on
in
a
kindly
way
since
electrical
force
had
been
employed
the
terrible
uproar
of
the
machinery
had
ceased
one
only
heard
the
silvery
ring
of
each
rail
as
it
spurted
forth
following
those
which
were
cooling
was
all
the
good
and
constant
production
of
an
epoch
of
peace
rails
and
yet
more
rails
in
order
that
every
frontier
might
be
crossed
and
that
the
nations
drawn
closer
and
closer
together
might
become
but
one
sole
nation
spread
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
which
was
becoming
a
perfect
network
of
roads
and
in
addition
to
the
rails
there
were
the
great
steel
ships
not
the
hateful
vessels
of
war
carrying
devastation
and
death
across
the
ocean
but
vessels
of
solidarity
and
brotherliness
enabling
continents
to
exchange
their
products
and
helping
on
the
increase
of
fortune
to
such
a
degree
that
prodigious
abundance
reigned
everywhere
and
there
were
also
the
bridges
facilitating
communication
and
the
girders
and
all
the
structural
materials
for
the
erection
of
the
innumerable
edifices
which
the
reconciled
communities
needed
for
their
public
life
the
the
libraries
the
museums
the
asylums
for
infancy
and
old
age
the
huge
general
stores
and
the
granaries
all
vast
enough
for
the
life
and
keep
of
the
federated
nations
and
finally
there
were
the
innumerable
machines
and
appliances
which
upon
all
sides
and
in
all
forms
of
labour
replaced
the
arms
of
men
those
which
tilled
the
soil
those
which
toiled
in
the
workshops
those
which
travelled
along
the
roads
athwart
the
waves
and
through
the
sky
and
luc
rejoiced
that
all
that
iron
and
steel
should
have
become
pacific
that
the
metal
of
conquest
which
mankind
had
so
long
employed
solely
to
make
the
swords
and
spears
that
it
needed
for
its
bloodthirsty
struggles
which
it
had
afterwards
turned
into
the
guns
and
shells
of
its
latter
days
of
carnage
should
be
used
now
that
peace
was
won
solely
for
the
erection
of
its
city
of
fraternity
justice
and
happiness
before
returning
home
that
day
luc
desired
to
give
a
last
glance
at
the
battery
of
electrical
furnaces
which
had
replaced
morfain
smeltery
the
battery
as
it
happened
was
then
at
work
amidst
a
blaze
of
sunshine
which
filled
the
glazed
shed
where
it
was
placed
every
five
minutes
the
mechanism
charged
the
furnaces
afresh
after
the
rolling
way
had
carried
off
the
ten
pigs
whose
glow
was
dimmed
by
the
bright
light
of
the
planet
and
here
again
watching
over
the
electrical
appliances
there
were
two
girls
each
about
twenty
one
of
them
a
charming
blonde
claudine
the
daughter
of
lucien
bonnaire
and
louise
mazelle
and
the
other
a
superb
brunette
cÃ©line
the
daughter
of
arsÃ¨ne
lenfant
and
eulalie
laboque
as
it
was
needful
that
they
should
give
all
their
attention
to
switching
the
current
on
and
off
they
were
at
first
only
able
to
smile
at
luc
but
a
short
rest
ensued
and
on
perceiving
a
group
of
children
who
stood
inquisitively
on
the
threshold
of
the
shed
they
came
forward
my
little
maurice
my
little
ludovic
my
little
aline
are
lessons
over
since
you
have
come
to
see
us
it
should
be
mentioned
that
the
children
by
way
of
recreation
and
in
the
idea
that
they
would
acquire
some
first
notions
of
various
forms
of
work
were
allowed
to
run
about
the
place
in
comparative
freedom
luc
well
pleased
at
seeing
his
grandson
maurice
again
made
the
whole
party
enter
the
shed
and
he
answered
their
numerous
questions
and
explained
the
mechanism
of
the
furnaces
and
even
made
the
appliances
work
again
by
way
of
showing
the
children
how
it
sufficed
for
claudine
or
cÃ©line
to
turn
a
little
lever
in
order
to
fuse
the
metal
and
enable
it
to
flow
forth
in
a
dazzling
stream
but
maurice
with
all
the
importance
of
a
little
man
who
though
only
nine
years
old
had
already
learnt
a
great
many
things
exclaimed
i
know
i
already
seen
it
grandfather
morfain
showed
me
everything
one
day
but
tell
me
grandfather
froment
is
it
true
that
there
used
to
be
furnaces
as
high
as
mountains
and
that
one
had
to
burn
face
day
and
night
in
order
to
get
anything
out
of
them
the
others
all
began
to
laugh
at
this
and
it
was
claudine
who
answered
course
there
were
grandfather
bonnaire
has
often
told
me
of
it
and
you
maurice
ought
to
know
the
story
for
your
the
great
morfain
as
he
is
still
called
was
the
last
to
wrestle
with
fire
like
a
hero
he
lived
up
yonder
in
a
cavern
in
the
rocks
and
never
came
down
to
the
town
but
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
watched
over
his
gigantic
furnace
the
monster
whose
ruins
one
can
still
see
on
the
like
those
of
some
of
the
ancient
days
maurice
eyes
dilated
with
astonishment
and
he
listened
with
all
the
passionate
interest
of
a
child
to
whom
some
prodigious
is
being
told
i
know
i
know
grandfather
morfain
told
me
all
about
his
father
and
the
furnace
as
high
as
a
mountain
but
all
the
same
i
thought
he
was
inventing
it
just
to
amuse
us
for
he
does
invent
stories
when
he
wants
to
make
us
laugh
and
so
it
true
yes
it
true
claudine
continued
above
there
were
workmen
who
loaded
the
furnace
by
emptying
into
it
of
ore
and
coal
and
down
below
there
were
other
workmen
ever
on
the
watch
ever
nursing
the
monster
so
that
it
might
not
have
an
attack
of
indigestion
which
would
have
prevented
the
work
from
being
properly
performed
that
lasted
seven
and
eight
years
at
a
stretch
said
cÃ©line
the
other
young
woman
monster
remained
alight
all
that
time
always
flaming
like
a
crater
without
it
being
possible
for
one
to
let
it
cool
for
if
it
did
cool
there
was
a
great
loss
it
had
to
be
broken
open
and
cleaned
and
almost
entirely
rebuilt
then
claudine
resumed
you
see
my
little
maurice
your
morfain
had
a
vast
deal
of
work
to
do
since
he
could
hardly
quit
that
fire
for
a
moment
during
seven
or
eight
years
besides
which
every
five
hours
he
had
to
clear
the
with
an
iron
bar
in
order
to
release
the
smelted
ore
which
ran
out
like
a
perfect
river
of
flames
hot
enough
to
roast
one
as
if
one
were
a
duck
on
the
spit
at
this
the
hitherto
stupefied
children
burst
into
loud
laughter
oh
the
idea
of
it
a
duck
on
the
spit
old
morfain
roasting
like
a
duck
well
said
ludovic
boisgelin
ca
have
been
very
amusing
to
work
in
those
days
it
must
have
given
one
too
much
trouble
course
his
sister
aline
exclaimed
glad
that
i
was
born
after
all
that
for
it
very
amusing
to
work
nowadays
maurice
however
had
become
serious
and
thoughtful
turning
over
in
his
mind
all
the
incredible
things
which
had
been
told
him
and
by
way
of
summing
up
everything
he
ended
by
saying
the
same
grandfather
father
must
have
been
awfully
strong
and
if
things
go
better
nowadays
it
is
perhaps
because
he
had
such
a
lot
of
trouble
formerly
luc
who
hitherto
had
contented
himself
with
smiling
was
delighted
by
this
remark
he
caught
up
maurice
and
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
are
right
my
boy
said
he
in
the
same
way
if
you
work
with
all
your
heart
nowadays
your
will
be
yet
happier
than
you
are
even
now
you
see
one
no
longer
roasts
like
a
duck
by
his
orders
the
battery
of
electrical
furnaces
was
started
once
more
claudine
and
cÃ©line
turning
the
current
on
or
off
by
a
simple
gesture
the
children
wished
to
direct
the
mechanism
themselves
and
how
delightful
did
that
easy
work
seem
after
the
narrative
of
morfain
hard
toil
the
toil
it
seemed
of
some
giant
living
in
a
world
that
had
disappeared
all
at
once
however
there
came
an
apparition
and
the
children
perturbed
by
it
ran
off
then
luc
again
perceived
boisgelin
who
this
time
stood
at
one
of
the
doorways
of
the
shed
watching
the
work
in
an
angry
mistrustful
way
like
some
master
who
is
for
ever
afraid
that
his
men
may
rob
him
he
was
often
to
be
seen
in
this
fashion
in
one
or
another
part
of
the
works
distracted
by
the
idea
that
the
place
was
too
vast
to
be
properly
inspected
by
him
and
maddened
more
and
more
by
the
thought
of
all
the
millions
that
he
must
every
day
be
losing
through
his
inability
to
check
the
work
of
all
those
people
who
were
earning
milliards
for
him
they
were
too
numerous
he
was
never
able
to
see
them
all
he
looked
so
haggard
so
exhausted
by
his
fruitless
roaming
through
the
workshops
that
luc
stirred
by
pity
this
time
wished
to
join
him
calm
him
and
lead
him
gently
home
but
boisgelin
was
on
his
guard
and
springing
back
ran
off
towards
the
large
workshops
his
morning
ramble
over
luc
now
returned
home
and
just
as
the
daylight
was
waning
in
the
afternoon
after
glancing
round
the
general
stores
he
went
to
spend
an
hour
with
the
jordans
in
the
little
overlooking
the
park
he
found
sÅurette
chatting
with
schoolmaster
hermeline
and
abbÃ©
marle
whilst
jordan
stretched
on
a
sofa
and
wrapped
in
a
rug
remained
thinking
according
to
his
wont
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
setting
sun
amiable
doctor
novarre
had
lately
been
carried
off
after
an
illness
of
a
few
hours
his
only
regret
being
that
he
would
not
behold
the
realisation
of
so
many
beautiful
things
in
the
possibility
of
which
he
had
at
the
outset
scarcely
believed
thus
sÅurette
nowadays
received
but
the
schoolmaster
and
the
priest
and
these
only
called
at
long
intervals
when
yielding
to
their
old
habit
of
meeting
at
her
house
hermeline
now
seventy
years
of
age
and
retired
was
ending
his
days
in
a
state
of
growing
bitterness
and
anger
against
all
that
passed
before
him
he
had
reached
such
a
point
in
this
respect
that
he
reproached
the
old
priest
with
lack
of
warmth
as
a
matter
of
fact
abbÃ©
marle
who
was
five
years
older
than
the
other
sought
refuge
in
dolorous
dignity
silence
which
became
more
and
more
haughty
as
he
beheld
his
church
becoming
empty
and
his
religion
expiring
as
luc
entered
and
took
a
chair
beside
sÅurette
who
sat
there
silent
gentle
and
patient
it
so
happened
that
the
schoolmaster
was
again
badgering
the
priest
like
the
sectarian
and
dictatorial
republican
that
he
still
was
come
abbÃ©
he
said
i
fall
in
with
your
views
you
ought
to
help
me
this
is
surely
the
end
of
the
world
children
passions
evil
growths
which
we
the
educators
were
formerly
appointed
to
crush
are
nowadays
cultivated
it
seems
how
is
it
possible
for
the
state
to
have
any
disciplined
citizens
reared
for
its
service
when
a
free
rein
is
given
to
anarchical
individuality
if
we
the
men
of
method
and
sense
do
manage
to
save
the
republic
it
is
surely
lost
since
the
day
when
he
had
thus
begun
to
speak
of
saving
the
republic
from
those
whom
he
called
the
socialists
and
the
anarchists
he
had
gone
over
to
the
side
of
reaction
joining
the
priest
in
his
hatred
of
all
who
dared
to
free
themselves
otherwise
than
by
his
own
narrow
jacobin
formula
and
he
went
on
yet
more
violently
tell
you
abbÃ©
that
your
church
will
be
swept
away
if
you
do
not
defend
it
your
religion
no
doubt
was
never
mine
but
i
have
always
admitted
the
necessity
of
a
religion
for
the
people
and
catholicism
was
certainly
an
admirable
governing
machine
so
stir
yourself
we
are
with
you
and
we
will
have
an
explanation
afterwards
when
we
have
the
lost
ground
together
at
first
abbÃ©
marle
simply
shook
his
head
as
a
rule
nowadays
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
answer
or
get
angry
at
last
he
slowly
said
do
the
whole
of
my
duty
i
am
at
my
altar
every
morning
even
when
my
church
is
empty
and
i
implore
god
to
perform
a
miracle
he
will
surely
do
so
if
he
deems
it
necessary
this
brought
the
old
schoolmaster
exasperation
to
a
climax
one
must
help
oneself
it
is
cowardly
to
do
nothing
sÅurette
smiling
and
full
of
tolerance
for
those
vanquished
men
thereupon
thought
it
necessary
to
intervene
the
good
doctor
was
still
here
said
she
would
beg
you
not
to
agree
so
well
together
since
your
seeming
agreement
only
makes
your
quarrel
worse
you
grieve
me
my
friends
i
should
have
been
so
happy
not
to
convert
you
to
our
ideas
but
to
see
you
admit
by
virtue
of
experience
a
little
of
all
the
good
which
our
ideas
have
effected
in
this
region
they
had
both
retained
great
deference
for
sÅurette
and
indeed
their
presence
in
that
little
beside
the
very
hearth
so
to
say
of
the
new
city
showed
what
ascendancy
she
still
exercised
over
them
for
her
sake
they
even
put
up
with
the
presence
of
luc
their
victorious
adversary
though
he
it
should
be
admitted
discreetly
avoided
all
appearance
of
triumphing
over
them
thus
on
this
occasion
he
refrained
from
intervening
however
furiously
hermeline
might
deny
all
that
he
had
created
after
all
thought
luc
this
was
simply
the
last
revolt
of
the
principle
of
authority
against
the
liberation
of
man
both
naturally
and
socially
on
seeing
the
nations
so
near
the
point
of
escaping
from
civil
as
well
as
religious
servitude
the
once
state
and
the
once
church
which
had
voraciously
contended
for
possession
of
them
now
tried
to
come
to
an
agreement
and
league
themselves
together
in
order
to
reconquer
the
nations
cried
hermeline
again
you
own
yourself
beaten
abbÃ©
it
must
be
all
over
in
that
case
i
can
only
keep
silent
as
you
do
and
withdraw
into
my
corner
to
die
the
priest
once
more
shook
his
head
preserving
silence
but
eventually
for
the
last
time
he
said
can
not
be
beaten
it
is
for
god
himself
to
act
the
night
was
now
slowly
falling
over
the
park
lengthening
shadows
were
filling
the
little
and
nobody
spoke
any
further
only
a
great
quiver
coming
from
the
melancholy
past
swept
through
the
room
finally
the
schoolmaster
rose
and
took
his
leave
then
as
the
priest
was
about
to
do
the
same
sÅurette
wished
to
slip
into
his
hand
the
sum
which
at
each
recurring
visit
she
had
been
accustomed
to
give
him
for
his
poor
this
time
however
he
refused
the
alms
which
he
had
been
accepting
so
regularly
for
more
than
forty
years
and
in
a
low
voice
he
slowly
said
thank
you
mademoiselle
keep
that
money
i
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
there
are
no
more
poor
ah
what
words
those
were
for
luc
more
poor
his
heart
had
leapt
as
he
heard
them
no
more
poor
no
more
starvelings
in
that
town
of
beauclair
which
he
had
known
so
black
so
wretched
peopled
by
such
an
accursed
race
of
famished
toilers
would
all
the
frightful
sores
which
had
come
from
the
be
healed
then
would
shame
and
crime
soon
disappear
even
as
want
did
the
reorganisation
of
work
in
accordance
with
justice
had
sufficed
already
to
bring
about
a
better
apportionment
of
wealth
and
thus
when
work
should
on
all
sides
become
honour
and
health
and
joy
an
entirely
peaceful
and
a
brotherly
race
would
assuredly
people
the
happy
city
jordan
who
still
lay
upon
the
sofa
wrapped
in
his
rug
had
hitherto
remained
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
upon
space
through
which
no
doubt
his
mind
was
roaming
at
last
abbÃ©
marle
and
hermeline
having
departed
he
woke
up
and
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
sunset
which
he
seemed
to
be
watching
with
passionate
interest
he
said
in
a
dreamy
manner
time
that
i
see
the
sun
set
i
become
dreadfully
sad
and
anxious
suppose
it
were
not
to
come
back
suppose
it
were
never
to
rise
again
over
the
black
and
earth
what
a
terrible
death
would
then
overtake
all
life
the
sun
is
the
father
the
fructifier
without
whom
all
germs
would
wither
or
rot
and
it
is
in
the
sun
that
we
must
place
our
hope
of
relief
and
future
happiness
for
if
it
were
not
to
help
us
life
would
some
day
dry
up
luc
had
begun
to
smile
he
knew
that
jordan
in
spite
of
his
great
age
he
was
now
nearly
had
for
some
years
been
studying
the
problem
of
how
he
might
capture
solar
heat
and
store
it
in
vast
reservoirs
in
order
to
distribute
it
afterwards
as
the
one
great
eternal
living
force
a
time
would
come
when
the
coal
in
the
mines
would
be
exhausted
and
where
would
one
then
find
the
necessary
energy
for
the
torrent
of
electricity
which
had
become
so
needful
for
life
thanks
to
his
first
discoveries
jordan
had
succeeded
in
supplying
an
abundance
of
electrical
force
for
next
to
nothing
but
what
a
victory
it
would
be
if
he
should
succeed
in
making
the
sun
the
universal
motor
if
he
should
be
able
to
take
from
it
direct
the
caloric
power
which
was
now
found
slumbering
in
coal
if
he
should
manage
to
employ
it
as
the
one
sole
fructifier
the
very
father
of
immortal
life
he
had
but
a
last
discovery
to
effect
and
then
his
work
would
be
accomplished
and
he
would
be
ready
to
die
alarm
yourself
said
luc
gaily
sun
will
rise
and
you
will
succeed
at
last
in
snatching
the
sacred
fire
from
it
however
sÅurette
whom
the
evening
breeze
now
coming
in
cool
gusts
through
the
open
window
rendered
somewhat
anxious
stepped
forward
to
ask
her
brother
you
feel
cold
would
you
like
me
to
shut
the
window
he
declined
the
offer
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
and
all
that
he
would
allow
was
that
she
should
wrap
him
round
with
the
rug
to
his
very
chin
he
now
seemed
to
live
solely
by
a
miracle
solely
because
he
wished
to
live
having
adjourned
death
until
the
evening
of
his
last
day
of
work
the
triumphant
evening
when
his
task
accomplished
he
might
at
last
sink
into
the
good
sleep
of
a
loyal
and
contented
worker
his
sister
surrounded
him
with
greater
precautions
than
ever
her
extreme
care
prolonged
his
strength
and
still
gave
him
two
hours
of
physical
and
intellectual
energy
each
day
two
hours
which
by
force
of
method
he
put
to
wonderful
use
and
thus
that
poor
old
puny
being
whom
the
slightest
draught
threatened
with
annihilation
was
completing
the
conquest
of
the
world
simply
because
he
was
still
a
stubborn
worker
one
who
did
not
throw
his
task
aside
will
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
said
luc
with
an
affectionate
laugh
at
this
jordan
likewise
made
merry
doubt
said
he
a
hundred
years
prove
necessary
again
deep
silence
fell
in
the
little
full
of
such
affectionate
intimacy
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
warm
twilight
stealing
slowly
over
the
park
whose
deep
paths
were
gradually
steeped
in
the
gloom
vague
gleams
still
hovered
just
above
the
lawns
whilst
the
great
trees
faded
away
and
became
like
light
and
quivering
apparitions
in
the
blue
distance
and
it
was
now
the
hour
the
sweethearts
to
whom
the
park
of
la
crÃªcherie
remained
open
and
who
therefore
came
thither
in
the
twilight
after
their
daily
work
nobody
troubled
about
the
roaming
shadowy
couples
who
holding
one
another
by
the
hand
gradually
melted
away
and
disappeared
amidst
the
greenery
they
were
confided
to
the
keeping
of
the
friendly
old
oaks
reliance
was
placed
on
the
freedom
to
love
that
was
granted
them
for
this
would
render
them
gentle
and
chaste
like
future
spouses
whose
embrace
becomes
an
indissoluble
tie
if
mutually
desired
to
love
always
one
need
only
know
why
and
how
one
loves
those
who
choose
one
another
knowing
and
consenting
never
part
and
already
along
the
dim
avenues
over
the
lawns
where
the
shadows
stretched
there
came
sauntering
couples
who
peopled
as
with
apparitions
the
mysterious
gloom
amidst
the
quiver
of
delight
which
the
fresh
odours
of
spring
brought
from
the
earth
as
other
couples
arrived
luc
recognised
among
them
several
of
the
lads
and
girls
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
workshops
that
morning
were
not
yonder
shadowy
forms
so
close
one
to
the
other
that
they
seemed
carried
by
one
and
the
same
flight
over
the
tips
of
the
grass
those
of
adolphe
laboque
and
germaine
yvonnot
and
those
others
whose
hair
mingled
their
heads
resting
one
against
the
other
were
they
not
hippolyte
mitaine
and
laure
fauchard
and
those
others
too
whose
arms
were
tightly
clasped
around
each
other
waist
were
they
not
alexandre
feuillat
and
clÃ©mence
bourron
yet
softer
emotion
came
to
luc
heart
when
he
fancied
that
he
recognised
his
son
charles
with
his
arm
around
the
cÃ©line
lenfant
and
his
son
jules
leading
away
in
his
embrace
the
fair
claudine
bonnaire
ah
the
young
folk
the
messengers
of
the
new
springtide
the
last
to
awaken
to
love
to
feel
kindling
within
them
the
glow
of
life
which
the
generations
transmit
one
to
the
other
as
yet
they
knew
but
the
chaste
quiver
which
comes
at
the
first
whispered
words
and
the
innocent
caress
the
clasp
in
which
ignorant
hearts
seek
one
another
and
the
furtive
kiss
whose
sweetness
suffices
to
open
the
portals
of
heaven
but
before
long
the
sovereign
flame
would
unite
and
blend
them
in
order
that
yet
other
artisans
of
love
might
spring
from
them
other
couples
who
in
years
to
come
would
repair
to
this
same
park
to
exchange
the
vows
of
budding
affection
for
there
would
ever
be
more
and
more
happiness
and
more
and
more
free
passion
tending
to
increase
of
harmony
even
now
other
couples
and
others
still
were
arriving
the
park
was
gradually
becoming
populous
with
all
the
sweethearts
of
the
happy
city
this
was
the
exquisite
evening
after
the
good
day
of
work
the
gloaming
spent
amidst
lawn
and
cover
shadowy
like
dreamland
steeped
in
mystery
and
perfume
with
nought
breaking
upon
the
silence
save
light
sounds
of
laughter
and
kisses
all
at
once
however
a
shadowy
form
stopped
outside
the
it
was
suzanne
who
had
anxiously
been
seeking
luc
and
on
finding
him
there
she
told
him
how
greatly
she
was
worried
by
boisgelin
prolonged
absence
for
he
had
not
yet
returned
home
never
before
had
he
lingered
like
this
out
of
doors
after
nightfall
were
right
she
repeated
did
wrong
in
leaving
him
to
his
mad
fancies
ah
the
unhappy
man
the
poor
old
child
luc
who
shared
her
fears
bade
her
go
home
again
may
return
at
any
moment
he
said
is
best
that
you
should
be
there
for
my
part
i
will
have
a
look
round
and
bring
you
tidings
he
at
once
took
two
men
with
him
and
crossed
the
park
with
the
intention
of
beginning
the
search
among
the
workshops
but
he
had
scarcely
taken
three
hundred
steps
and
was
near
the
little
lake
fringed
with
willows
quite
a
nook
of
paradise
when
he
halted
on
hearing
a
light
cry
of
terror
which
came
from
an
adjacent
clump
of
greenery
from
amidst
that
foliage
there
ran
a
pair
of
frightened
lovers
who
he
fancied
were
his
son
jules
and
the
fair
claudine
bonnaire
is
the
matter
what
has
alarmed
you
he
called
but
they
did
not
answer
they
fled
as
beneath
a
blast
of
terror
like
love
birds
whose
caresses
have
been
disturbed
by
some
frightful
encounter
and
when
luc
himself
decided
to
enter
the
copse
he
also
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
horror
for
he
had
almost
knocked
against
a
body
which
hung
from
a
branch
there
blocking
the
narrow
pathway
in
the
last
gleam
of
light
falling
from
the
sky
where
the
stars
were
now
appearing
luc
recognised
the
body
as
that
of
boisgelin
the
unhappy
man
the
poor
old
child
he
murmured
repeating
suzanne
words
and
feeling
quite
upset
by
that
horrible
tragedy
which
would
cause
her
such
deep
grief
with
the
help
of
his
companions
he
cut
down
the
body
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
but
it
was
already
quite
cold
the
unhappy
man
must
have
hanged
himself
there
early
in
the
afternoon
after
his
desperate
ramble
through
the
busy
works
luc
fancied
that
he
could
divine
everything
when
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
he
noticed
a
large
hole
which
boisgelin
had
apparently
dug
with
his
hands
a
hole
in
which
he
had
no
doubt
meant
to
bury
the
prodigious
fortune
which
his
people
of
workers
earned
for
him
that
fortune
which
he
knew
not
how
to
manage
or
how
to
store
away
and
despairing
perchance
of
his
power
to
make
a
pit
of
sufficient
size
for
so
much
wealth
he
had
ended
by
resolving
to
die
there
and
thus
rid
himself
of
the
horrible
embarrassment
in
which
he
was
placed
by
his
and
crushing
fortune
his
day
of
wild
roaming
his
madness
his
inability
to
live
idler
that
he
was
in
the
new
city
of
just
work
had
culminated
in
that
tragic
death
and
he
had
hung
there
whilst
the
park
in
the
clasp
of
warm
and
nuptial
night
was
filled
with
the
rustling
of
caresses
and
the
whispering
of
loving
vows
in
order
to
avoid
frightening
the
shadowy
couples
gliding
between
the
trees
around
him
luc
at
once
sent
the
two
men
to
fetch
a
stretcher
at
la
crÃªcherie
at
the
same
time
begging
them
to
tell
nobody
of
the
lugubrious
discovery
and
when
they
had
returned
and
laid
the
lifeless
body
between
the
little
curtains
of
grey
canvas
the
mournful
set
off
along
the
blackest
of
the
paths
in
order
to
escape
observation
in
this
wise
death
frightful
death
passed
along
silently
steeped
in
shadows
through
the
delightful
awakening
of
spring
now
all
with
new
life
lovers
seemed
to
arise
on
all
sides
springing
up
at
the
bends
of
each
avenue
in
the
recesses
of
each
clump
of
bushes
a
perfume
of
flowers
made
the
air
quite
balmy
hands
sought
hands
and
lips
met
love
was
budding
a
fresh
wave
was
coming
to
increase
humanity
broad
stream
death
was
incessantly
vanquished
and
were
ever
sprouting
in
order
that
there
might
be
yet
more
truth
more
justice
more
happiness
in
the
world
suzanne
stood
waiting
in
a
state
of
anguish
at
the
door
of
the
house
her
eyes
gazing
into
the
night
when
she
perceived
the
stretcher
she
understood
and
gave
vent
to
a
low
moan
and
when
luc
in
a
few
words
had
acquainted
her
with
the
wretched
end
of
the
useless
being
now
slumbering
there
she
was
only
able
to
repeat
as
she
thought
of
that
empty
poisoned
and
poisonous
life
which
had
brought
her
so
much
suffering
the
unhappy
man
the
poor
old
child
other
catastrophes
took
place
amidst
the
crumbling
of
the
rotten
society
of
the
old
days
now
fated
to
disappear
but
the
greatest
stir
of
all
was
caused
by
one
that
occurred
during
the
ensuing
month
the
collapse
of
the
old
church
of
saint
vincent
one
bright
sunshiny
morning
when
abbÃ©
marle
was
at
the
altar
celebrating
mass
solely
for
the
sparrows
which
flew
through
the
deserted
nave
the
priest
had
long
been
aware
that
his
church
would
some
day
fall
upon
him
it
dated
from
the
sixteenth
century
and
was
in
a
very
damaged
condition
cracking
upon
all
sides
the
steeple
had
certainly
been
repaired
some
forty
years
previously
but
from
lack
of
funds
it
had
been
necessary
to
postpone
all
work
on
the
roofing
whose
beams
half
eaten
away
were
already
yielding
and
since
that
time
every
application
for
a
grant
had
been
made
in
vain
the
state
overburdened
with
debts
abandoned
that
church
of
a
remote
region
the
town
of
beauclair
refused
to
contribute
anything
mayor
gourier
having
never
been
on
the
side
of
the
priests
thus
abbÃ©
marle
reduced
to
his
own
resources
had
been
obliged
to
seek
among
the
faithful
the
large
sum
which
became
more
and
more
urgently
required
if
the
edifice
was
not
to
fall
upon
his
shoulders
but
in
vain
did
he
knock
at
the
doors
of
wealthy
parishioners
the
faithful
were
dwindling
away
their
zeal
was
fast
cooling
during
the
lifetime
of
the
beautiful
lÃ©onore
the
wife
whose
extreme
piety
proved
some
compensation
for
her
atheism
the
priest
had
found
precious
help
in
her
subsequently
however
only
madame
mazelle
had
remained
to
him
and
not
only
did
her
fervour
decline
but
she
was
in
no
wise
of
a
generous
disposition
in
course
of
time
worries
respecting
her
fortune
consumed
her
and
she
came
less
and
less
frequently
to
saint
vincent
in
such
wise
that
nobody
was
left
to
the
priest
save
a
few
poor
creatures
who
in
their
wretchedness
clung
obstinately
to
the
hope
of
a
better
life
and
finally
when
no
poor
remained
the
church
became
quite
empty
and
the
abbÃ©
lived
there
in
solitude
amidst
the
abandonment
in
which
mankind
now
at
last
left
his
religion
of
error
and
wretchedness
the
abbÃ©
then
felt
that
a
world
was
indeed
expiring
around
him
his
complaisance
had
been
powerless
to
save
the
life
of
the
lying
poisonous
which
was
devoured
by
its
own
iniquities
in
vain
had
he
cast
the
cloak
of
religion
over
its
last
agony
it
had
died
amidst
a
final
scandal
and
in
vain
too
had
he
sought
a
refuge
in
the
strict
letter
of
dogma
in
order
that
he
might
concede
nothing
to
the
truths
of
science
which
he
could
realise
were
mounting
to
the
supreme
and
victorious
assault
by
which
the
ancient
edifice
of
catholicism
would
be
destroyed
science
indeed
had
at
last
effected
its
breach
dogma
was
finally
swept
away
and
the
kingdom
of
god
was
about
to
be
set
not
in
some
fabulous
paradise
but
upon
this
very
earth
in
the
name
of
triumphant
justice
a
new
religion
the
religion
of
man
at
last
truly
conscious
free
and
master
of
his
destiny
was
sweeping
away
the
ancient
mythologies
the
forms
of
symbolism
amidst
which
he
had
lost
himself
during
the
anguish
of
his
long
struggle
against
nature
after
the
temples
of
ancient
idolatry
the
catholic
churches
in
their
turn
had
to
disappear
now
that
a
fraternal
people
set
its
certain
happiness
in
the
sole
force
of
its
living
solidarity
without
need
of
any
political
system
of
punishments
and
rewards
thus
the
priest
since
confessional
and
holy
table
alike
had
been
deserted
since
the
faithful
had
departed
from
his
church
beheld
each
day
when
he
celebrated
mass
there
the
cracks
in
the
walls
spreading
and
the
beams
of
the
roofs
yielding
more
and
more
it
was
a
constant
crumbling
a
gradual
process
of
destruction
and
ruin
the
slightest
premonitory
sounds
of
which
he
could
detect
but
since
he
had
been
unable
to
summon
the
builders
even
for
the
most
urgent
repairs
he
must
necessarily
allow
the
work
of
death
to
follow
its
course
and
culminate
in
the
natural
end
of
things
thus
he
simply
waited
and
continued
to
say
his
mass
like
a
hero
of
faith
alone
with
his
forsaken
creed
whilst
the
roof
cracked
more
and
more
above
the
altar
a
morning
came
when
abbÃ©
marle
perceived
that
another
large
stretch
of
the
vaulting
of
the
nave
had
split
during
the
previous
night
and
although
he
now
felt
certain
of
the
downfall
which
he
had
been
anticipating
for
months
past
he
nevertheless
came
to
celebrate
his
last
mass
clad
in
his
richest
vestments
very
tall
and
with
a
nose
like
an
eagle
beak
he
still
held
himself
firm
and
upright
in
spite
of
his
advanced
age
he
dispensed
with
servers
now
he
came
and
went
spoke
the
sacramental
words
and
made
the
usual
gestures
as
if
a
great
throng
were
pressing
together
before
him
docile
to
his
voice
but
in
the
state
of
abandonment
in
which
the
church
was
left
only
some
broken
chairs
lay
upon
the
suggesting
the
mouldy
garden
seats
that
are
left
forgetfully
out
of
doors
exposed
to
the
rains
of
winter
weeds
grew
round
the
columns
over
which
moss
was
spreading
all
the
winds
of
heaven
streamed
in
through
the
broken
windows
and
the
great
doorway
being
half
unhinged
remained
partially
open
allowing
the
animals
of
the
neighbourhood
to
flock
in
on
that
fine
bright
day
however
it
was
particularly
the
sunshine
that
poured
into
the
edifice
like
a
conqueror
setting
as
it
were
a
triumphal
invasion
of
life
amidst
that
tragic
ruin
where
birds
flew
hither
and
thither
and
where
wild
oats
germinated
even
among
the
stone
mantles
of
the
old
saints
above
the
altar
however
there
still
reigned
a
great
crucifix
of
painted
and
gilded
wood
displaying
a
long
livid
effigy
splashed
with
some
blackish
blood
that
dripped
like
tears
whilst
abbÃ©
marle
was
reading
the
gospel
he
heard
a
louder
cracking
and
some
dust
and
some
fragments
of
plaster
fell
upon
the
altar
then
at
the
moment
of
the
offertory
the
sinister
rending
began
again
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
edifice
were
shaking
before
it
fell
but
the
priest
collecting
all
the
remaining
strength
of
his
faith
together
for
the
elevation
prayed
with
his
whole
soul
for
the
miracle
for
whose
glorious
splendour
he
had
so
long
been
waiting
if
it
should
so
please
god
the
church
would
regain
its
vigorous
youth
and
be
endowed
with
sturdy
pillars
upholding
an
indestructible
nave
masons
were
not
necessary
the
almighty
power
would
suffice
and
a
magnificent
sanctuary
would
arise
there
with
chapels
of
gold
windows
of
purple
marvellously
carved
and
dazzling
marble
whilst
a
multitude
of
the
faithful
on
their
knees
would
sing
the
hymn
of
resurrection
amidst
the
blaze
of
thousands
of
candles
and
the
loud
pealing
of
bells
but
at
the
very
moment
when
the
priest
finishing
his
prayer
raised
the
chalice
it
was
not
the
miracle
he
asked
for
that
came
it
was
annihilation
he
stood
there
erect
with
both
arms
raised
in
a
superb
gesture
of
heroic
belief
and
the
vaulted
roof
was
rent
asunder
as
if
by
a
bolt
from
heaven
and
crashed
downward
in
a
whirlwind
of
fragments
with
a
roar
like
that
of
thunder
the
shaken
steeple
tottered
and
then
in
its
turn
fell
ripping
the
remainder
of
the
roof
open
and
dragging
down
the
rest
of
the
sundered
walls
and
nought
remained
beneath
the
bright
sun
save
a
huge
litter
of
stones
and
tiles
amidst
which
a
fruitless
search
was
made
for
abbÃ©
marle
he
had
disappeared
as
if
the
remnants
of
the
shattered
altar
had
consumed
his
flesh
drunk
his
blood
and
in
like
way
nothing
was
ever
found
of
the
great
crucifix
of
painted
and
gilded
wood
that
also
had
been
shattered
to
atoms
reduced
to
dust
thus
yet
another
religion
was
dead
the
last
priest
saying
his
last
mass
had
perished
with
the
last
of
the
churches
for
a
few
days
old
hermeline
the
retired
schoolmaster
was
seen
prowling
about
the
ruins
and
talking
aloud
as
old
folk
are
wont
to
do
when
haunted
by
some
fixed
idea
his
words
could
not
be
plainly
distinguished
but
he
seemed
to
be
still
arguing
and
reproaching
the
abbÃ©
for
having
failed
to
obtain
the
needed
miracle
then
one
morning
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
and
later
on
when
the
ruins
of
the
church
had
been
cleared
away
a
garden
was
planted
there
with
fine
trees
and
shady
walks
skirting
lawns
lovers
went
thither
on
pleasant
evenings
even
as
they
went
to
the
park
of
la
crÃªcherie
the
happy
city
was
ever
spreading
children
were
growing
and
becoming
lovers
in
their
turn
lovers
whose
kisses
in
the
shade
again
sowed
future
harvests
after
the
gay
day
of
work
came
love
amidst
the
roses
blooming
upon
every
side
and
in
that
delightful
garden
where
slept
the
dust
of
a
religion
of
wretchedness
and
death
one
now
beheld
the
growth
of
human
joy
the
overflowing
florescence
of
life
iv
during
yet
another
ten
years
the
city
continued
growing
and
organising
new
society
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
justice
and
peace
and
at
last
one
of
june
on
the
eve
of
one
of
the
great
festivals
of
work
which
took
place
four
times
a
year
coinciding
with
the
seasons
bonnaire
met
with
a
strange
experience
he
bonnaire
now
nearly
years
of
age
had
become
the
patriarch
the
hero
of
work
still
straight
and
tall
with
an
energetic
head
under
a
crown
of
thick
white
hair
he
remained
active
and
gay
in
the
enjoyment
of
good
health
old
revolutionary
that
he
was
a
theoretical
collectivist
pacified
by
the
sight
of
his
happiness
he
now
tasted
all
the
reward
of
his
long
efforts
the
conquest
of
that
harmonious
solidarity
amidst
which
he
saw
his
grandchildren
and
growing
in
all
felicity
that
evening
then
just
as
the
daylight
was
waning
bonnaire
happened
to
be
strolling
near
the
entrance
of
the
brias
gorges
he
often
walked
abroad
in
this
fashion
with
the
sole
assistance
of
a
stick
for
the
pleasure
of
viewing
the
countryside
once
more
and
recalling
memories
on
this
occasion
he
had
just
reached
the
spot
where
in
former
days
had
stood
the
gates
of
the
abyss
which
had
long
since
disappeared
near
that
spot
also
a
wooden
bridge
had
once
spanned
the
mionne
but
no
trace
of
it
remained
for
the
torrent
had
been
covered
over
for
a
distance
of
about
a
hundred
yards
to
admit
of
the
passage
of
a
broad
boulevard
what
changes
there
were
thought
bonnaire
who
would
ever
have
recognised
the
former
black
and
muddy
threshold
of
the
accursed
factory
in
that
broad
open
space
over
which
there
now
passed
a
quiet
avenue
lined
with
smiling
houses
as
he
lingered
there
for
a
moment
erect
and
handsome
like
the
happy
old
man
he
was
he
experienced
great
surprise
on
perceiving
another
old
man
a
stranger
huddled
up
on
a
wayside
bench
near
him
and
this
other
seemed
to
have
been
wrecked
by
misery
for
his
clothes
were
in
tatters
his
face
ravaged
and
bushy
with
hair
his
frame
emaciated
and
trembling
as
if
with
some
evil
fever
poor
man
muttered
bonnaire
speaking
aloud
in
his
astonishment
it
was
certainly
a
poor
man
and
years
had
now
gone
by
since
bonnaire
had
seen
one
it
was
evident
however
that
he
who
sat
on
the
bench
did
not
belong
to
the
region
his
shoes
and
clothes
were
white
with
dust
and
he
must
have
sunk
upon
that
bench
near
the
entry
of
the
town
from
sheer
fatigue
after
tramping
the
roads
for
days
and
days
his
staff
and
his
empty
wallet
had
fallen
from
his
weary
hands
and
lay
at
his
feet
with
an
air
of
exhaustion
he
let
his
gaze
wander
around
him
like
one
who
is
lost
who
knows
not
where
he
may
be
full
of
pity
bonnaire
drew
near
to
him
i
help
you
my
poor
fellow
he
asked
strength
is
exhausted
and
you
seem
to
be
in
great
distress
then
as
the
other
did
not
answer
but
still
let
his
eyes
roam
in
a
scared
way
from
one
point
of
the
horizon
to
the
other
bonnaire
continued
you
hungry
do
you
need
a
good
bed
let
me
guide
you
you
will
here
find
all
the
help
you
need
thereupon
the
old
and
beggar
began
to
stammer
in
a
low
voice
as
if
speaking
to
himself
beauclair
is
this
really
beauclair
course
it
is
you
are
at
beauclair
that
certain
declared
the
former
with
a
smile
but
on
seeing
the
other
give
signs
of
increasing
surprise
and
anxiety
he
ended
by
understanding
the
truth
knew
beauclair
formerly
no
doubt
said
he
is
perhaps
a
long
time
since
you
were
last
here
it
was
more
than
fifty
years
ago
the
stranger
answered
in
a
husky
voice
then
bonnaire
burst
into
laughter
that
case
i
am
not
astonished
if
you
find
a
difficulty
in
recognising
the
place
he
retorted
have
been
some
changes
for
instance
here
the
abyss
works
have
disappeared
whilst
yonder
the
sordid
hovels
of
old
beauclair
have
been
razed
to
the
ground
and
you
can
see
that
a
new
city
has
been
built
the
park
of
la
crÃªcherie
has
spread
over
everything
invading
the
former
town
with
its
greenery
and
turning
it
into
a
vast
garden
where
the
little
white
houses
peep
brightly
from
among
the
trees
and
thus
one
naturally
has
to
reflect
before
one
can
recognise
the
place
the
stranger
had
followed
the
explanations
turning
his
glance
upon
the
various
points
which
bonnaire
with
gentle
gaiety
indicated
but
again
he
wagged
his
head
as
if
he
could
not
believe
what
was
told
him
no
said
he
do
recognise
it
this
ca
be
beauclair
yonder
are
the
two
promontories
of
the
bleuse
mountains
between
which
the
brias
gorge
opens
and
yonder
too
far
away
is
the
plain
of
la
roumagne
that
certain
but
all
the
rest
those
fine
gardens
and
those
houses
belong
to
some
other
spot
some
wealthy
and
smiling
land
which
i
never
saw
before
ah
well
i
shall
have
to
walk
further
i
must
have
made
a
mistake
in
the
road
after
picking
up
his
staff
and
his
wallet
he
was
making
an
effort
to
rise
from
the
bench
when
his
eyes
at
last
rested
on
the
old
man
who
had
shown
himself
so
obliging
and
friendly
and
at
the
first
glance
which
he
gave
bonnaire
he
shuddered
and
became
anxious
to
depart
had
he
recognised
bonnaire
then
although
he
could
not
recognise
the
town
bonnaire
for
his
part
was
so
stirred
by
the
sudden
flame
which
shot
from
the
other
hairy
countenance
that
he
examined
him
more
attentively
where
had
he
previously
seen
those
bright
eyes
which
blazed
in
moments
of
savage
violence
all
at
once
his
memory
awoke
and
in
his
turn
he
shuddered
whilst
all
the
past
lived
anew
in
the
cry
which
burst
from
his
lips
for
fifty
years
people
had
believed
him
to
be
dead
but
the
crushed
and
mutilated
body
found
in
a
gorge
of
the
bleuse
mountains
on
the
morrow
of
his
flight
after
his
crime
had
not
been
his
he
lived
he
lived
good
heavens
he
had
come
back
and
to
bonnaire
that
extraordinary
resurrection
after
so
many
events
and
so
many
years
brought
anguish
anguish
respecting
all
that
had
happened
in
the
past
and
all
that
might
happen
ragu
it
is
you
bonnaire
repeated
the
other
already
had
his
staff
in
his
hand
his
wallet
on
his
shoulder
but
as
he
was
recognised
why
should
he
go
off
it
was
certain
now
that
he
had
not
mistaken
his
road
me
sure
enough
my
old
bonnaire
he
replied
since
you
are
still
alive
though
you
are
ten
years
older
than
i
i
have
certainly
a
right
to
be
alive
also
though
it
true
that
i
very
battered
then
in
the
jeering
tone
of
former
times
he
resumed
you
give
me
your
word
for
it
that
splendid
big
garden
yonder
with
those
pretty
houses
is
really
beauclair
well
since
i
got
here
i
only
to
look
for
an
inn
where
they
let
me
sleep
in
a
corner
of
the
stables
why
had
he
come
back
what
plans
were
rife
under
that
bald
skull
behind
that
wrinkled
face
ravaged
by
so
many
years
of
evil
and
vagabond
life
bonnaire
who
grew
more
and
more
anxious
could
already
picture
ragu
disturbing
the
festival
on
the
morrow
by
some
scandal
or
other
he
dared
not
question
him
at
once
but
he
felt
that
it
would
be
best
to
have
him
in
his
charge
moreover
he
was
full
of
pity
his
heart
was
quite
stirred
at
finding
the
unhappy
man
in
such
a
state
of
destitution
are
no
more
inns
he
answered
will
have
to
come
to
my
place
you
be
able
to
eat
as
much
as
you
like
there
and
you
will
sleep
in
a
comfortable
bed
then
we
can
have
a
chat
you
tell
me
what
you
want
and
i
help
you
to
content
yourself
if
possible
but
ragu
jeered
again
what
i
want
he
retorted
the
wishes
of
an
old
beggar
like
me
more
or
less
infirm
are
of
no
account
at
all
what
i
want
indeed
why
i
wanted
to
see
you
all
again
to
give
a
glance
in
passing
at
the
place
where
i
was
born
the
idea
worried
me
and
i
should
have
died
easy
in
mind
if
i
had
come
for
a
stroll
in
this
direction
that
a
thing
anybody
may
do
is
it
the
roads
are
still
free
doubt
so
i
started
oh
years
ago
when
a
man
got
bad
legs
and
never
a
copper
he
does
make
much
progress
all
the
same
one
reaches
one
destination
at
last
since
here
i
am
and
it
understood
go
to
your
place
since
you
offer
me
hospitality
like
a
good
comrade
the
night
was
falling
and
the
two
old
men
were
able
to
cross
new
beauclair
without
being
remarked
on
the
way
ragu
astonishment
increased
he
glanced
to
right
and
to
left
but
could
not
recognise
a
single
spot
at
last
when
bonnaire
stopped
before
one
of
the
most
charming
of
the
dwellings
a
house
standing
amidst
a
clump
of
fine
trees
an
exclamation
escaped
ragu
showing
that
he
still
retained
his
ideas
of
former
times
you
made
your
fortune
you
become
a
now
the
former
began
to
laugh
no
i
never
been
anything
but
a
workman
and
i
only
one
but
in
a
sense
true
that
we
all
made
our
fortunes
and
all
become
as
if
his
envious
fears
were
quieted
by
that
answer
ragu
began
to
sneer
once
more
workman
ca
be
a
said
he
if
a
man
still
works
it
because
he
has
made
his
fortune
right
my
good
fellow
we
have
a
chat
about
it
and
explain
things
to
you
meantime
go
in
go
in
bonnaire
for
the
time
being
was
dwelling
alone
in
this
house
which
was
that
of
his
granddaughter
claudine
now
the
wife
of
charles
froment
daddy
lunot
had
long
since
been
dead
and
his
daughter
ragu
sister
the
terrible
toupe
had
followed
him
to
his
grave
during
the
previous
year
after
a
frightful
quarrel
which
as
she
expressed
it
had
turned
her
blood
when
ragu
heard
of
the
loss
of
his
sister
and
father
he
simply
made
a
little
gesture
as
if
to
say
that
by
reason
of
their
age
he
had
anticipated
it
after
an
absence
of
half
a
century
one
is
not
surprised
to
find
nobody
one
knew
left
among
the
living
here
we
are
in
the
house
of
my
granddaughter
claudine
continued
bonnaire
the
daughter
of
my
eldest
son
lucien
who
married
louise
mazelle
the
daughter
of
the
rentiers
whom
you
must
remember
claudine
herself
has
married
charles
froment
a
son
of
the
master
of
la
crÃªcherie
but
she
and
charles
have
taken
their
daughter
aline
a
little
girl
of
eight
to
see
an
aunt
at
formeries
and
they
wo
be
back
till
evening
then
he
concluded
gaily
some
months
now
the
children
have
taken
me
to
live
with
them
by
way
of
petting
me
come
the
house
is
ours
you
must
eat
and
drink
your
fill
and
then
i
show
you
to
your
bed
when
it
daylight
we
see
to
all
the
rest
ragu
head
swam
as
he
listened
all
those
names
those
marriages
those
three
generations
flitting
by
at
a
gallop
quite
scared
him
how
was
he
ever
to
understand
things
when
so
many
unknown
events
and
so
many
marriages
and
births
had
taken
place
he
did
not
speak
again
but
seated
at
a
table
ate
some
cold
meat
and
fruit
ravenously
in
the
gay
room
which
was
brilliantly
illumined
by
an
electric
lamp
the
comfort
and
ease
which
he
felt
around
him
must
have
weighed
heavily
upon
the
old
vagabond
shoulders
for
he
seemed
yet
more
aged
more
utterly
for
as
with
his
face
lowered
over
his
plate
he
devoured
the
food
glancing
askance
the
while
at
all
the
encompassing
happiness
in
which
he
had
no
share
his
very
silence
his
downcast
mien
at
the
sight
of
so
much
comfort
was
expressive
of
all
his
long
rancour
his
powerless
thirst
for
vengeance
his
now
irrealisable
dream
of
triumphing
and
seeing
disaster
fall
on
others
and
bonnaire
again
uneasy
at
the
sight
of
his
gloominess
wondered
through
what
adventures
he
had
rolled
during
the
last
and
felt
more
and
more
astonished
at
finding
him
still
alive
and
in
such
destitution
have
you
come
from
he
ended
by
inquiring
from
everywhere
more
or
less
ragu
answered
with
a
sweeping
gesture
so
you
seen
a
good
many
countries
and
people
and
things
yes
in
france
germany
england
and
america
and
elsewhere
dragged
my
carcase
indeed
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
then
lighting
his
pipe
he
gave
bonnaire
before
retiring
to
bed
some
idea
of
his
life
as
a
wanderer
in
rebellion
against
work
idle
by
nature
and
coveting
enjoyment
he
typified
the
spoilt
fruit
of
the
the
who
dreams
of
suppressing
the
masters
in
order
to
take
their
place
and
in
his
turn
crush
down
his
fellows
in
his
estimation
there
could
be
no
other
happiness
than
that
of
making
a
big
fortune
and
enjoying
it
with
the
satisfaction
that
one
had
known
how
to
exploit
the
misery
of
the
poor
and
violent
in
language
but
all
the
same
cowardly
in
the
master
presence
dishonest
addicted
to
drink
and
incapable
of
steady
work
he
had
rolled
from
workshop
to
workshop
from
country
to
country
at
times
dismissed
at
others
impelled
by
some
silly
whim
to
take
himself
off
he
had
never
been
able
to
put
a
copper
by
wherever
he
had
found
himself
want
had
become
his
companion
each
succeeding
year
bringing
about
a
fresh
decline
in
his
fortunes
when
old
age
arrived
it
was
a
wonder
that
he
did
not
die
famished
and
forsaken
in
some
gutter
until
he
was
nearly
sixty
however
he
had
still
found
some
petty
jobs
to
do
then
he
had
stranded
in
a
hospital
but
had
been
obliged
to
leave
it
though
only
to
fall
into
another
one
for
the
last
fifteen
years
he
had
thus
been
clinging
to
life
how
he
could
hardly
tell
and
now
he
begged
and
tramped
the
roads
for
the
crust
of
bread
and
truss
of
straw
that
he
needed
and
nothing
of
his
old
nature
had
departed
from
him
neither
his
covert
rage
and
jealousy
nor
his
eager
desire
to
be
a
master
and
enjoy
himself
restraining
a
flood
of
questions
which
rose
to
his
lips
bonnaire
at
last
exclaimed
all
the
countries
you
passed
through
must
now
be
in
a
state
of
revolution
i
know
very
well
that
we
have
progressed
quickly
here
and
are
in
advance
of
the
others
but
the
whole
world
is
now
stirring
is
it
not
yes
ragu
answered
in
his
jeering
way
are
fighting
and
building
up
a
new
society
on
all
sides
but
all
that
did
not
prevent
me
from
starving
he
had
passed
through
strikes
and
terrible
risings
in
germany
in
england
and
especially
in
the
united
states
in
all
the
countries
through
which
his
rancour
and
idleness
had
carried
him
he
had
witnessed
tragic
events
the
last
empires
were
crumbling
republics
were
springing
up
in
their
place
while
frontiers
were
being
suppressed
by
the
confederation
of
neighbouring
nations
it
was
like
a
smash
up
of
the
ice
at
the
advent
of
springtide
when
the
ice
melts
and
disappears
uncovering
the
fertilised
soil
where
germs
sprout
and
flower
forth
in
a
few
days
under
the
glow
of
the
great
brotherly
sun
all
mankind
was
certainly
in
evolution
busying
itself
at
last
with
the
foundation
of
the
happy
city
but
he
ragu
bad
workman
discontented
reveller
that
he
was
had
simply
suffered
from
all
the
catastrophes
he
had
witnessed
merely
encountering
blows
therein
without
ever
finding
an
opportunity
even
to
pillage
a
rich
man
cellar
and
for
once
in
his
life
drink
his
fill
nowadays
having
become
a
confirmed
old
vagabond
and
beggar
he
cared
not
a
curse
for
the
city
of
justice
and
peace
it
would
not
bring
him
back
his
twentieth
birthday
it
would
not
give
him
a
palace
full
of
slaves
where
he
might
have
ended
his
days
amidst
a
round
of
pleasures
like
the
kings
that
books
speak
of
and
he
jeered
bitterly
at
the
idiocy
of
the
human
race
which
took
so
much
trouble
to
prepare
a
somewhat
cleaner
social
edifice
for
the
of
the
next
century
an
edifice
which
the
men
of
nowadays
would
only
know
in
dreams
that
dream
has
long
sufficed
for
happiness
quietly
said
bonnaire
what
you
say
is
not
true
the
edifice
is
almost
rebuilt
even
now
and
is
very
beautiful
and
healthy
and
gay
i
will
show
it
to
you
and
you
will
see
if
one
does
not
taste
pleasure
in
dwelling
in
it
then
he
explained
that
on
the
following
day
he
would
take
ragu
to
witness
one
of
the
four
festivals
of
work
which
filled
beauclair
with
delight
on
the
first
day
of
each
season
each
of
these
festivals
was
marked
by
some
particular
rejoicings
appropriate
to
the
seasons
the
one
on
the
morrow
the
summer
festival
would
be
bright
with
all
the
flowers
and
fruits
of
the
earth
overflowing
in
prodigious
abundance
amidst
the
sovereign
splendour
of
horizon
and
sky
in
which
the
powerful
sun
of
june
would
blaze
ragu
however
relapsed
into
gloomy
anxiety
a
covert
fear
indeed
lest
he
should
really
find
the
ancient
dream
of
social
happiness
fulfilled
at
beauclair
was
it
a
fact
then
that
after
traversing
so
many
countries
where
the
society
of
was
coming
forth
amidst
such
frightful
struggles
was
it
a
fact
that
he
would
behold
it
virtually
installed
in
that
town
his
own
whence
he
had
fled
on
a
day
of
murderous
madness
had
that
happiness
for
which
he
had
sought
so
frantically
on
all
sides
come
into
being
on
his
native
spot
during
his
absence
had
he
returned
merely
to
behold
the
felicity
of
others
now
that
he
himself
could
no
longer
expect
any
joy
in
life
the
idea
that
he
had
spoilt
his
existence
to
the
very
end
seemed
to
him
like
a
supreme
crushing
blow
amidst
his
misery
and
weariness
whilst
he
sat
there
silently
finishing
the
bottle
of
wine
which
had
been
placed
before
him
and
when
bonnaire
rose
to
show
him
to
his
room
a
white
room
with
a
large
white
bed
in
it
he
followed
with
a
heavy
step
suffering
from
the
brotherly
hospitality
offered
to
him
with
such
happy
ease
well
my
good
fellow
said
bonnaire
morning
till
unless
this
cursed
world
should
fall
to
pieces
during
the
night
bonnaire
who
also
went
to
bed
found
some
difficulty
in
getting
to
sleep
for
he
still
felt
worried
with
respect
to
ragu
intentions
he
had
a
dozen
times
resisted
his
desire
to
put
plain
questions
to
him
on
the
subject
from
fear
of
provoking
some
dangerous
explanation
for
he
thought
it
might
be
preferable
to
keep
the
matter
in
reserve
and
act
hereafter
according
to
circumstances
he
feared
some
frightful
scene
for
perhaps
that
wretched
vagabond
maddened
by
want
and
disaster
might
have
come
back
in
order
to
provoke
a
scandal
insult
luc
insult
josine
and
even
attempt
murder
again
bonnaire
therefore
resolved
that
he
would
not
leave
him
alone
for
a
moment
on
the
following
day
moreover
in
his
desire
to
show
him
everything
at
beauclair
there
was
the
hope
of
morally
paralysing
him
by
an
exhibition
of
such
an
abundance
of
wealth
and
power
as
would
make
him
realise
how
futile
would
be
the
rage
and
rebellion
of
any
one
individual
when
he
should
have
seen
and
learnt
everything
he
would
no
longer
dare
to
stir
his
defeat
would
be
definitive
and
thus
bonnaire
at
last
fell
asleep
resolved
on
waging
that
final
battle
for
the
sake
of
general
harmony
peace
and
love
already
at
six
on
the
following
morning
a
joyous
flourish
of
trumpets
sped
over
the
roofs
of
beauclair
announcing
the
festival
of
work
the
sun
was
already
high
in
the
beautiful
blue
heavens
windows
opened
greetings
flew
through
the
greenery
from
one
house
to
another
and
one
could
feel
that
joy
was
already
stirring
the
soul
of
the
city
whilst
the
trumpet
calls
continued
arousing
from
garden
to
garden
the
cries
of
children
and
the
laughter
of
loving
couples
bonnaire
having
quickly
dressed
himself
found
ragu
up
washed
and
clad
in
some
clean
garments
which
had
been
laid
for
him
the
previous
evening
on
a
chair
now
that
he
had
well
rested
the
vagabond
had
become
quite
the
jeerer
of
former
days
resolved
upon
deriding
everything
and
refusing
to
acknowledge
the
existence
of
the
slightest
progress
on
seeing
his
host
enter
he
indulged
once
more
in
his
old
evil
insulting
laugh
say
old
man
he
exclaimed
a
row
they
make
with
those
trumpets
that
must
be
precious
disagreeable
for
those
who
do
like
to
be
startled
out
of
their
sleep
are
you
wakened
every
morning
in
your
barracks
by
that
music
the
old
preferred
to
find
his
guest
in
this
mood
he
smiled
quietly
and
answered
no
that
only
the
of
our
high
days
and
holidays
on
other
mornings
one
can
oversleep
oneself
if
one
chooses
for
the
quiet
is
delightful
but
when
life
so
pleasant
one
always
gets
up
early
and
only
the
infirm
regret
having
to
lie
in
bed
then
with
his
attentive
kindness
he
added
you
slept
well
did
you
find
everything
you
wanted
ragu
tried
to
make
himself
disagreeable
again
i
can
sleep
anywhere
said
he
years
past
i
been
sleeping
among
hayricks
and
they
are
worth
the
best
beds
in
the
world
it
just
the
same
as
regards
all
those
inventions
you
have
here
baths
and
cold
and
hot
water
taps
and
electrical
heating
appliances
which
you
only
have
to
switch
on
they
may
be
useful
no
doubt
when
one
in
a
hurry
but
it
still
preferable
to
wash
in
the
river
and
warm
oneself
before
a
good
old
stove
and
as
his
host
did
not
reply
he
concluded
by
saying
have
too
much
water
in
your
houses
they
must
be
damp
what
blasphemy
the
idea
of
it
those
streaming
beneficent
waters
so
pure
and
so
fresh
which
were
now
the
very
health
and
joy
and
strength
of
beauclair
whose
streets
and
gardens
they
bathed
as
with
eternal
youth
water
is
our
friend
the
good
fairy
of
our
happy
destiny
bonnaire
replied
will
see
it
gushing
forth
on
every
side
and
fertilising
our
city
but
come
and
have
some
breakfast
we
will
go
out
directly
afterwards
that
first
breakfast
in
the
bright
illumined
by
the
rising
sun
was
delightful
on
the
white
cloth
there
were
eggs
milk
and
fruit
with
bread
which
was
so
golden
and
smelt
so
sweet
that
one
could
divine
it
had
been
kneaded
by
carefully
worked
machinery
for
a
happy
people
and
the
old
host
lavished
on
his
wretched
guest
the
most
delicate
attentions
a
simple
and
affectionate
hospitality
which
set
an
atmosphere
of
gentleness
and
kindness
all
around
whilst
they
ate
they
again
began
to
chat
as
on
the
previous
evening
bonnaire
prudently
refrained
from
asking
ragu
any
direct
questions
yet
he
felt
persuaded
that
the
other
after
the
fashion
of
all
criminals
had
returned
to
the
scene
of
his
crime
consumed
by
an
invincible
craving
to
behold
it
again
and
know
what
had
taken
place
during
his
absence
was
josine
still
alive
and
if
so
what
was
she
doing
had
luc
been
saved
from
death
and
had
he
taken
her
to
live
with
him
at
all
events
what
had
become
of
them
both
surely
it
was
an
ardent
curiosity
with
respect
to
all
those
matters
which
glittered
in
the
bright
eyes
as
he
did
not
mention
them
however
preferring
apparently
to
keep
his
secret
locked
within
him
bonnaire
had
to
content
himself
with
putting
into
execution
the
plan
which
he
had
thought
of
the
previous
night
without
mentioning
luc
name
he
began
to
explain
the
greatness
of
his
work
you
to
understand
things
properly
my
good
fellow
said
he
necessary
that
i
should
tell
you
something
about
our
position
before
we
take
a
stroll
through
beauclair
we
have
now
got
to
the
triumph
the
full
florescence
of
the
movement
which
was
scarcely
beginning
when
you
went
away
then
he
reverted
to
the
origin
of
the
evolution
the
establishment
of
the
works
of
la
crÃªcherie
based
on
an
association
between
capital
labour
and
brains
and
its
struggle
with
the
abyss
where
the
barbarous
had
been
enforced
at
last
the
latter
had
been
vanquished
and
replaced
and
la
crÃªcherie
with
its
pleasant
white
houses
had
gradually
spread
over
the
site
of
old
beauclair
the
wretched
home
of
want
then
bonnaire
showed
how
both
in
a
spirit
of
imitation
and
by
reason
of
the
necessities
of
the
position
all
the
neighbouring
works
had
ended
by
joining
the
original
association
and
how
in
due
course
other
groups
had
been
formed
every
calling
of
a
similar
kind
gradually
being
syndicated
together
every
family
as
it
were
meeting
and
uniting
then
the
of
producers
on
the
one
hand
and
of
consumers
on
the
other
had
completed
the
victory
work
being
reorganised
on
a
basis
of
human
solidarity
and
bringing
in
its
train
a
new
form
of
society
there
was
now
only
four
work
a
day
and
it
was
work
freely
chosen
and
constantly
varied
in
order
that
it
might
remain
attractive
whilst
machinery
the
enemy
of
former
days
had
at
present
become
a
docile
slave
upon
whom
all
great
efforts
were
cast
then
moreover
the
of
consumers
had
swept
away
trade
which
had
simply
absorbed
so
much
energy
and
gain
huge
general
stores
centralised
products
of
all
kinds
and
distributed
them
according
to
consumers
needs
and
in
this
manner
millions
of
money
were
saved
agiotage
and
theft
abstracting
nothing
on
the
way
indeed
life
was
becoming
greatly
simplified
there
was
a
tendency
towards
the
complete
suppression
of
specie
and
the
closing
of
law
courts
and
prisons
for
disputes
on
matters
of
private
interest
ceased
and
no
longer
urged
man
against
man
in
some
mad
fit
of
fraud
pillage
or
murder
why
should
there
be
any
crime
left
since
there
were
no
more
poor
no
more
disinherited
ones
since
brotherly
peace
was
being
established
more
and
more
firmly
every
day
all
being
at
last
convinced
that
individual
happiness
came
from
the
happiness
of
all
a
long
peace
reigned
the
blood
tax
the
conscription
had
disappeared
like
all
other
taxes
there
were
no
longer
any
rates
of
any
kind
or
any
prohibitive
laws
but
in
lieu
thereof
full
liberty
for
production
and
exchange
and
in
particular
since
the
parasites
the
innumerable
functionaries
magistrates
and
churchmen
had
been
suppressed
the
greatest
wealth
had
set
in
such
a
prodigious
heap
of
riches
accumulating
that
from
year
to
year
the
granaries
became
too
small
and
threatened
to
burst
beneath
the
abundance
of
the
public
fortune
all
right
interrupted
ragu
when
bonnaire
had
reached
this
point
all
the
same
the
real
pleasure
is
to
do
nothing
and
if
you
still
work
you
are
not
a
gentleman
to
my
idea
there
no
getting
away
from
that
besides
in
one
manner
or
another
you
are
still
paid
so
that
you
still
have
a
but
you
are
converted
eh
you
who
always
demanded
the
absolute
destruction
of
capital
bonnaire
laughed
with
joyous
frankness
true
they
ended
by
converting
me
he
said
believed
in
the
necessity
of
a
sudden
revolution
some
stroke
which
would
have
placed
power
in
our
hands
together
with
possession
of
the
soil
and
all
the
instruments
of
work
but
how
can
one
resist
the
force
of
experience
for
so
many
years
past
i
been
witnessing
here
the
assured
victory
of
social
justice
and
brotherly
happiness
which
i
dreamt
of
so
long
and
thus
patience
has
come
to
me
i
weak
enough
if
you
like
to
put
it
that
way
to
rest
content
with
conquests
certain
as
i
am
of
final
victory
of
course
i
ready
to
grant
that
a
great
deal
remains
to
be
done
our
liberty
and
justice
are
not
complete
capital
and
the
must
entirely
disappear
the
social
pact
must
be
rid
of
all
forms
of
authority
we
must
have
the
free
individual
in
the
free
community
and
we
try
to
act
in
such
wise
that
our
children
may
bring
about
the
reign
of
justice
and
liberty
in
their
entirety
then
he
explained
the
new
educational
methods
which
were
in
force
the
working
of
the
schools
and
apprenticeship
workshops
the
adoption
and
cultivation
of
all
the
forms
of
energy
springing
from
the
passions
and
the
of
boys
and
girls
together
with
the
view
of
drawing
yet
closer
the
ties
of
love
on
which
the
strength
would
depend
the
cause
of
greater
freedom
in
the
future
rested
with
the
couples
of
it
might
be
taken
that
each
generation
growing
up
amidst
an
increase
of
equity
and
kindliness
would
contribute
its
stone
to
the
final
edifice
meantime
the
city
wealth
would
continue
accumulating
now
that
the
suppression
of
the
right
of
inheritance
almost
entirely
accomplished
prevented
the
building
up
of
huge
scandalous
and
poisonous
individual
fortunes
in
such
wise
that
the
prodigious
output
of
the
work
of
all
was
becoming
the
property
of
all
such
things
as
the
state
funds
were
also
falling
to
pieces
the
rentiers
the
idlers
who
lived
on
the
work
of
others
or
on
egotistical
savings
of
their
own
were
disappearing
all
citizens
were
equally
rich
since
the
city
overflowing
with
work
freed
from
obstacles
and
hindrances
preserved
from
waste
and
theft
was
piling
up
such
immense
wealth
that
production
would
assuredly
some
day
have
to
be
moderated
enjoyments
once
reserved
for
a
few
privileged
beings
were
already
within
the
reach
of
all
and
if
family
life
remained
simple
the
public
edifices
had
become
wonderfully
sumptuous
large
enough
to
hold
huge
multitudes
and
so
charming
and
so
commodious
as
to
be
indeed
true
palaces
of
the
people
centres
of
enjoyment
where
it
loved
to
live
there
were
museums
and
libraries
theatres
bathing
establishments
places
for
diversions
of
one
and
another
kind
together
with
simple
opening
out
of
meeting
and
lecture
halls
which
the
whole
town
frequented
in
its
hours
of
rest
there
was
also
a
great
number
of
hospitals
special
isolated
hospitals
for
each
kind
of
disease
and
asylums
which
the
infirm
and
the
aged
could
enter
freely
others
too
particularly
for
mothers
and
children
for
pregnant
women
who
were
carefully
nursed
from
an
early
stage
until
their
babes
were
born
and
they
themselves
had
fully
recovered
their
strength
in
this
wise
the
new
city
affirmed
its
faith
in
motherhood
and
childhood
the
mother
who
is
the
source
of
eternal
life
the
child
who
is
the
victorious
messenger
of
the
future
now
bonnaire
gaily
concluded
you
have
finished
breakfast
let
us
go
to
see
all
those
fine
things
our
beauclair
in
its
festive
gaiety
i
sha
spare
you
a
single
interesting
nook
of
it
at
this
ragu
who
had
resolved
upon
no
surrender
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
repeating
what
he
deemed
to
be
his
decisive
argument
you
like
but
all
the
same
you
are
not
gentlemen
you
are
still
poor
devils
if
you
still
work
work
your
master
and
when
all
said
you
remained
a
people
of
slaves
at
the
door
of
the
house
a
little
electric
car
with
accommodation
for
two
persons
was
waiting
similar
cars
were
at
the
disposal
of
all
the
old
who
despite
his
advanced
years
had
retained
a
clear
eyesight
and
a
firm
hand
made
his
companion
get
in
and
then
took
his
own
seat
as
driver
do
mean
to
cripple
me
for
good
with
this
mechanism
eh
asked
ragu
no
do
be
alarmed
we
get
on
very
well
together
electricity
and
i
bonnaire
replied
adding
will
find
it
everywhere
it
is
the
one
force
which
drives
our
machinery
and
it
is
in
general
use
in
our
homes
just
like
a
domestic
servant
oh
it
has
been
necessary
to
produce
it
in
incalculable
quantities
and
yet
it
seems
that
not
enough
and
that
the
former
master
of
la
crÃªcherie
is
trying
to
provide
us
with
a
still
larger
supply
in
order
that
we
may
have
something
like
a
planet
blazing
over
beauclair
at
and
live
amidst
the
glow
of
eternal
day
he
laughed
at
this
idea
of
putting
all
darkness
to
flight
whilst
the
car
glided
rapidly
along
the
broad
avenues
before
exploring
beauclair
he
proposed
to
go
as
far
as
les
combettes
in
order
to
show
his
companion
the
magnificent
estate
which
was
changing
la
roumagne
into
a
paradise
of
fertility
the
festive
morning
was
bright
with
sunshine
the
roads
resounded
with
gaiety
laughter
and
songs
arising
from
all
the
other
electric
cars
which
were
continually
met
on
the
way
a
great
many
foot
passengers
were
also
arriving
from
neighbouring
villages
mostly
in
bands
lads
and
girls
brave
in
their
ribbons
who
joyously
saluted
bonnaire
the
patriarch
and
on
either
side
of
the
road
stretched
a
perfect
sea
of
grain
instead
of
the
narrow
patches
of
ground
badly
manured
and
badly
tilled
one
found
but
one
sole
huge
field
richly
cultivated
by
thousands
of
associates
whenever
the
soil
showed
sign
of
impoverishment
the
properties
it
lacked
were
imparted
to
it
by
a
chemical
dressing
it
was
warmed
too
and
screened
and
high
cultivation
brought
forth
two
crops
of
vegetables
and
fruit
each
season
thanks
to
machinery
man
was
spared
many
efforts
the
harvests
sprang
up
as
if
by
enchantment
over
leagues
and
leagues
of
ploughed
land
it
was
even
said
that
one
would
become
master
of
the
clouds
directing
them
upon
one
or
another
point
at
will
by
means
of
electric
currents
in
such
wise
as
to
obtain
days
of
rain
or
days
of
sunshine
according
to
the
needs
of
cultivation
see
my
good
fellow
resumed
bonnaire
with
a
sweeping
gesture
have
the
wherewithal
for
bread
bread
for
all
the
bread
to
which
each
acquires
a
right
as
soon
as
he
is
born
you
feed
even
those
who
do
work
asked
ragu
we
do
but
with
very
few
exceptions
only
the
sick
and
the
infirm
refrain
from
working
when
one
in
good
health
it
bores
one
too
much
to
remain
doing
nothing
the
car
was
now
traversing
some
orchards
and
the
endless
rows
of
cherry
trees
covered
with
red
fruit
presented
a
delightful
spectacle
the
apricots
farther
on
were
not
yet
ripe
and
green
was
the
fruit
which
weighed
down
the
apple
and
pear
trees
nevertheless
there
was
extraordinary
abundance
enough
dessert
indeed
for
a
whole
nation
until
the
ensuing
spring
but
they
were
at
last
reaching
les
combettes
the
sordid
village
of
former
days
had
disappeared
and
white
houses
had
been
built
among
the
greenery
alongside
the
the
once
filthy
stream
which
was
now
canalised
its
pure
water
contributing
to
all
the
surrounding
fertility
one
no
longer
beheld
the
country
side
of
the
old
times
all
abandonment
dirt
and
wretchedness
in
which
the
peasantry
had
wallowed
for
centuries
with
the
obstinacy
born
of
routine
and
hatred
of
each
other
the
spirit
of
truth
and
liberty
had
visited
that
spot
and
an
evolution
had
set
in
towards
science
and
harmony
enlightening
minds
reconciling
hearts
and
bringing
health
wealth
and
joy
in
its
train
since
all
had
consented
to
the
happiness
of
each
had
come
into
being
remember
old
combettes
said
bonnaire
hovels
standing
in
mud
and
dung
and
the
peasants
who
complained
of
dying
of
starvation
see
what
association
has
done
for
all
that
in
his
savage
jealousy
however
ragu
would
not
let
himself
be
convinced
with
that
hatred
of
work
which
had
remained
in
his
blood
the
hereditary
hatred
of
a
chained
to
toil
he
replied
they
work
they
are
not
happy
their
happiness
is
mendacious
the
sovereign
enjoyment
is
to
do
nothing
and
though
in
former
times
he
had
often
reviled
the
priests
he
now
added
the
catechism
say
that
work
is
man
punishment
and
mark
of
degradation
when
once
one
gets
to
heaven
one
has
nothing
to
do
there
on
the
way
back
to
beauclair
the
car
passed
la
guerdache
which
was
now
enlarged
and
whose
grounds
were
full
of
young
mothers
their
babes
and
playful
children
but
even
the
sight
of
that
palace
of
the
people
and
its
beautiful
park
did
not
influence
ragu
all
what
the
value
of
luxury
and
enjoyment
which
everybody
can
share
said
he
thing
that
one
ca
have
entirely
to
oneself
is
worth
much
however
the
little
car
was
still
speeding
along
and
they
soon
found
themselves
in
beauclair
once
more
the
town
as
ragu
had
remarked
on
first
perceiving
it
did
indeed
present
the
aspect
of
a
large
garden
the
houses
instead
of
being
pressed
close
one
to
the
other
as
in
the
days
of
tyranny
and
terror
seemed
to
have
dispersed
in
order
that
their
inmates
might
enjoy
more
freedom
quietude
and
health
land
cost
nothing
since
all
had
been
put
in
common
from
one
to
the
other
promontory
of
the
bleuse
mountains
why
therefore
should
folk
have
heaped
themselves
together
when
the
whole
great
plain
spread
before
them
are
a
few
thousand
square
yards
of
land
too
much
for
a
family
when
so
many
immense
tracts
of
the
earth
are
absolutely
uninhabited
thus
each
family
had
chosen
its
lot
and
had
built
according
to
its
fancy
broad
avenues
ran
past
the
gardens
supplying
abundant
means
of
communication
but
people
were
not
required
to
build
their
houses
in
line
they
simply
set
them
amongst
the
trees
in
the
manner
they
pleased
still
the
dwellings
had
a
family
aspect
for
all
were
clean
and
gay
and
decorated
with
stoneware
and
faÃ¯ence
of
bright
colours
enamelled
tiles
and
so
forth
which
formed
gables
borders
panels
friezes
and
cornices
the
the
and
the
of
all
this
ornamentation
imparting
to
the
houses
much
the
appearance
of
huge
nosegays
amidst
the
verdure
of
the
trees
then
on
the
squares
at
the
points
where
the
avenues
met
rose
the
many
public
buildings
huge
piles
in
which
triumphed
steel
and
iron
their
magnificence
was
compounded
of
simplicity
of
logical
fitness
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
intended
and
of
intelligence
in
the
choice
of
materials
and
style
of
decoration
in
these
buildings
it
was
intended
that
the
people
should
be
at
home
the
museums
libraries
theatres
baths
laboratories
meeting
and
amusement
halls
were
but
so
many
open
to
the
entire
community
moreover
some
portions
of
the
avenues
were
already
being
covered
with
glass
and
it
was
proposed
to
warm
them
in
winter
so
as
to
enable
people
to
stroll
there
in
comfort
during
cold
and
rainy
weather
ragu
gave
so
many
signs
of
surprise
and
seemed
so
lost
that
bonnaire
began
to
laugh
it
is
easy
to
identify
the
place
said
he
we
are
now
on
the
old
place
de
la
mairie
whence
started
the
four
great
thoroughfares
the
rue
de
brias
the
rue
de
formeries
the
rue
de
and
the
rue
de
magnolles
only
as
the
old
was
falling
to
pieces
from
sheer
rottenness
it
was
demolished
together
with
the
old
schools
where
the
boys
learned
to
spell
under
the
master
rod
and
now
you
see
there
is
a
series
of
large
pavilions
chemical
and
physical
laboratories
where
all
are
free
to
study
and
experiment
when
they
think
they
have
made
some
discovery
which
may
prove
useful
to
the
community
then
too
the
four
streets
have
been
transformed
their
hovels
have
been
swept
away
and
little
of
them
remains
save
the
gardens
and
houses
of
the
gentlefolk
in
which
sundry
marriages
have
ended
by
placing
the
children
of
the
poor
devils
of
former
times
then
bonnaire
went
on
to
explain
other
transformations
brought
about
by
the
victory
of
the
new
social
system
for
instance
although
the
had
been
preserved
and
two
wings
had
even
been
added
to
it
it
had
been
converted
into
a
public
library
in
the
same
way
the
had
become
a
museum
whilst
it
had
been
possible
at
no
very
great
cost
to
turn
the
prison
with
its
cells
into
a
where
water
abounded
then
there
was
the
garden
which
had
been
planted
on
the
site
of
the
fallen
church
a
garden
where
some
fine
shady
verdure
already
arose
around
a
little
lake
which
now
filled
the
ancient
underground
crypt
in
this
wise
as
the
various
forms
of
authority
disappeared
the
buildings
once
allotted
to
them
had
reverted
to
the
people
who
had
disposed
of
them
in
such
a
manner
as
to
increase
their
own
comfort
and
enjoyment
however
whilst
the
car
was
ascending
another
fine
long
avenue
ragu
again
felt
lost
and
inquired
of
his
guide
are
we
now
the
old
rue
de
brias
bonnaire
answered
its
aspect
has
greatly
changed
petty
trade
having
completely
disappeared
the
shops
shut
up
one
after
the
other
and
at
last
the
old
houses
were
demolished
to
make
room
for
those
new
ones
which
smile
so
pleasantly
among
the
hawthorns
and
lilac
bushes
the
clouque
that
poisonous
sewer
has
been
covered
up
and
the
side
walk
of
this
avenue
on
the
right
passes
over
it
he
went
on
recalling
the
narrow
dark
rue
de
brias
of
former
times
with
its
pavement
over
which
weary
workers
had
trudged
day
by
day
hunger
and
prostitution
had
prowled
there
at
night
whilst
poor
housewives
went
from
shop
to
shop
to
beg
a
petty
credit
there
had
reigned
the
laboques
levying
tribute
on
all
purchasers
whilst
caffiaux
poisoned
the
workers
with
doctored
alcohol
and
dacheux
kept
jealous
watch
over
his
meat
holy
meat
the
chosen
food
of
the
wealthy
only
the
beautiful
madame
mitaine
had
been
willing
to
close
her
eyes
when
a
loaf
or
two
happened
to
disappear
from
her
on
the
days
when
the
street
urchins
were
unable
to
restrain
their
hunger
but
now
all
the
misery
and
suffering
had
been
swept
away
and
the
avenue
ascended
broad
clean
and
flooded
with
sunlight
with
only
the
houses
of
happy
workers
upon
either
hand
whilst
the
multitude
strolled
about
laughing
and
singing
on
that
bright
festive
morning
if
la
clouque
flow
under
that
grassy
bank
exclaimed
ragu
suddenly
beauclair
must
have
been
over
yonder
on
the
site
of
that
new
park
where
the
white
are
peeping
out
of
the
greenery
and
this
time
he
remained
aghast
the
spot
he
mentioned
had
indeed
been
old
beauclair
the
sordid
mass
of
hovels
spread
out
like
an
stagnant
pond
with
its
streets
lacking
both
light
and
air
and
infected
by
their
open
drains
he
particularly
remembered
the
rue
des
trois
lunes
the
darkest
narrowest
and
filthiest
of
them
all
but
the
blast
of
avenging
justice
had
purified
the
spot
carried
away
the
abominable
cloaca
and
in
place
thereof
had
set
that
greenery
amidst
which
had
sprung
dwellings
of
health
and
joy
bonnaire
amused
by
ragu
astonishment
now
drove
him
more
slowly
along
the
new
thoroughfares
of
the
happy
city
of
work
in
honour
of
that
day
of
rejoicing
all
the
houses
were
gay
with
bunting
bright
oriflammes
flapped
in
the
light
morning
breeze
and
vivid
drapery
hung
about
doors
and
windows
the
thresholds
of
the
houses
too
were
covered
with
roses
the
streets
even
were
bestrewn
with
them
such
an
abundance
of
roses
being
grown
in
the
vast
plantations
of
the
neighbourhood
that
the
whole
town
was
able
to
adorn
itself
with
them
like
a
woman
on
her
bridal
morn
music
resounded
on
all
sides
the
chorus
singing
of
maids
and
youths
flew
past
in
sonorous
waves
whilst
the
pure
voices
of
the
children
soared
aloft
to
the
very
sun
itself
it
seemed
as
if
the
limpid
and
rejoicing
orb
were
also
participating
in
the
festival
as
it
cast
great
sheets
of
gold
under
the
sky
sumptuous
tent
so
aerial
and
silken
and
so
delightfully
blue
all
the
people
were
now
flocking
into
the
streets
arrayed
in
garments
adorned
with
beautiful
stuffs
which
had
once
been
so
dear
and
which
were
now
at
the
disposal
of
all
new
fashions
very
simple
in
their
magnificence
made
the
women
look
adorable
gold
since
money
had
gradually
disappeared
was
now
simply
used
for
purposes
of
adornment
each
little
girl
that
was
born
found
in
her
cradle
her
necklets
her
bracelets
and
her
rings
even
as
the
little
ones
of
former
days
had
found
their
toys
but
jewellery
now
had
no
value
gold
had
simply
become
so
much
beauty
and
moreover
the
electrical
furnaces
were
about
to
produce
incalculable
quantities
of
diamonds
and
precious
stones
sacks
of
rubies
emeralds
and
sapphires
gems
enough
indeed
to
cover
all
the
women
of
the
world
the
maids
who
passed
hanging
on
their
lovers
arms
already
had
their
hair
adorned
with
constellations
of
flashing
stars
and
there
was
an
endless
procession
of
couples
those
whom
love
in
its
freedom
had
just
betrothed
the
young
folk
of
twenty
too
who
had
recently
mated
and
were
never
more
to
part
and
those
also
who
had
grown
old
amidst
mutual
affection
and
whose
had
tightened
with
each
succeeding
year
are
they
all
going
like
that
ragu
at
last
inquired
they
are
calling
on
one
another
bonnaire
answered
one
another
to
the
grand
dinner
which
is
to
be
given
this
evening
and
which
you
will
attend
and
many
are
just
strolling
about
in
the
sunshine
for
the
love
of
the
thing
because
they
feel
gay
and
at
home
in
our
beautiful
brotherly
streets
besides
there
are
entertainments
and
games
on
all
sides
with
admission
gratis
of
course
for
one
may
freely
enter
all
our
public
establishments
those
parties
of
children
are
being
taken
to
one
or
another
circus
and
others
of
the
crowd
are
going
to
meetings
theatrical
performances
and
concerts
our
theatres
you
know
enter
into
our
system
of
social
education
then
all
at
once
on
reaching
a
house
whose
occupiers
it
seemed
were
about
to
go
out
bonnaire
stopped
the
car
you
like
to
visit
one
of
our
new
houses
he
asked
is
where
my
grandson
fÃ©licien
lives
and
as
we
have
just
caught
him
at
home
he
will
receive
us
fÃ©licien
was
the
son
of
sÃ©verin
bonnaire
who
had
married
lÃ©onie
the
daughter
of
and
achille
gourier
he
fÃ©licien
only
a
fortnight
previously
had
for
his
part
espoused
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
jollivet
daughter
of
andrÃ©
jollivet
and
pauline
froment
but
when
bonnaire
wished
to
explain
those
relationships
to
ragu
the
latter
made
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
feels
quite
lost
amidst
such
a
tangle
of
alliances
the
young
people
were
charming
the
wife
very
young
and
adorably
fair
the
husband
also
fair
and
tall
and
strong
love
perfumed
all
the
bright
gay
simple
yet
elegantly
furnished
rooms
of
their
home
which
like
the
streets
was
that
day
full
of
roses
for
it
seemed
as
if
roses
had
rained
upon
beauclair
there
were
some
everywhere
even
on
the
roofs
the
whole
house
was
visited
and
then
they
returned
to
a
room
which
served
as
a
workshop
a
large
square
apartment
where
an
electrical
motor
was
installed
besides
following
three
or
four
other
callings
fÃ©licien
was
by
taste
a
and
preferred
to
work
at
this
avocation
in
his
own
home
several
of
his
comrades
young
men
of
his
own
age
were
similarly
inclined
and
a
new
movement
was
thus
arising
among
the
generation
just
reaching
manhood
one
found
the
worker
on
a
small
scale
following
some
calling
at
home
in
all
freedom
irrespective
of
work
in
the
great
general
workshops
for
these
individual
artisans
the
supply
of
electric
power
which
they
found
in
their
homes
even
as
they
found
water
there
was
of
wonderful
assistance
under
such
conditions
proved
easy
and
clean
and
light
and
some
houses
were
gradually
becoming
family
workshops
and
tending
to
the
realisation
of
the
formula
the
free
workman
in
the
free
city
this
evening
my
children
said
bonnaire
taking
leave
you
dine
at
our
table
it
impossible
this
time
grandfather
was
the
reply
have
our
places
at
grandmother
morfain
table
but
we
shall
see
one
another
at
dessert
ragu
took
his
seat
in
the
car
again
without
speaking
a
word
he
had
remained
silent
throughout
the
visit
though
for
a
moment
he
had
paused
before
the
little
motor
at
last
he
once
again
managed
to
throw
off
the
emotion
which
he
had
felt
in
the
midst
of
so
much
comfort
and
happiness
he
exclaimed
one
call
those
the
houses
of
when
there
machinery
in
the
largest
room
i
grant
that
your
men
are
better
lodged
and
have
more
enjoyment
since
want
has
disappeared
but
they
are
still
workmen
mercenaries
condemned
to
labour
in
the
old
days
there
were
at
least
a
few
happy
privileged
folk
who
did
nothing
all
your
progress
consists
in
reducing
the
entire
community
to
common
slavery
at
this
despairing
cry
from
that
devotee
of
sloth
whose
religion
was
fast
crumbling
bonnaire
gently
shrugged
his
shoulders
must
understand
my
good
fellow
said
he
it
is
that
you
call
slavery
if
it
be
slavery
to
breathe
and
eat
and
sleep
in
a
word
to
live
why
then
work
is
slavery
but
if
you
live
you
must
necessarily
work
one
can
not
live
an
hour
without
doing
work
of
some
kind
however
we
talk
of
all
that
for
the
present
let
us
go
home
to
lunch
and
we
spend
the
afternoon
in
visiting
the
workshops
and
the
stores
after
their
meal
indeed
they
went
out
again
but
this
time
on
foot
walking
along
leisurely
they
crossed
the
entire
works
all
the
sunlit
halls
where
the
steel
and
copper
of
the
new
machinery
shone
like
jewels
in
the
bright
radiance
that
morning
moreover
some
of
the
workers
parties
of
youths
and
girls
had
come
to
decorate
the
machinery
with
garlands
of
verdure
and
roses
for
was
it
not
right
that
it
should
participate
in
the
festival
of
work
powerful
gentle
and
docile
artisan
that
it
was
bringing
relief
both
to
man
and
to
beast
and
nothing
could
have
been
gayer
or
more
touching
the
roses
that
adorned
the
presses
the
huge
hammers
the
giant
planing
rolling
and
turning
machines
proclaimed
how
attractive
work
had
become
bringing
comfort
to
the
body
and
delight
to
the
mind
songs
rang
out
too
chains
were
formed
and
amidst
general
laughter
quite
a
began
spreading
gradually
from
one
hall
to
another
and
transforming
the
entire
works
into
an
immense
palace
of
rejoicing
ragu
who
still
remained
impassive
walked
about
raising
his
eyes
to
the
lofty
windows
which
were
bright
with
sunshine
or
glancing
now
at
the
slabs
under
foot
and
now
at
the
walls
of
speckless
brightness
or
else
examining
the
machines
many
of
which
were
unknown
to
him
they
were
huge
creatures
provided
with
all
sorts
of
intricate
works
in
order
that
they
might
perform
most
of
the
tasks
once
allotted
to
man
the
most
trying
as
well
as
the
most
delicate
some
had
legs
arms
feet
and
hands
so
that
they
might
move
embrace
clutch
and
manipulate
metal
with
fingers
at
once
supple
nimble
and
strong
the
new
puddling
furnaces
in
which
the
was
kneaded
mechanically
particularly
struck
ragu
was
it
possible
that
the
came
out
like
that
quite
ready
to
pass
under
the
hammer
and
then
there
was
the
electricity
that
propelled
the
bridges
that
set
the
huge
hammers
in
motion
that
worked
the
which
could
have
covered
the
whole
world
with
rails
on
each
and
every
side
one
found
that
sovereign
electric
force
it
had
become
like
the
very
blood
of
the
factory
circulating
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
workshops
giving
life
to
all
things
acting
as
the
one
source
of
movement
heat
and
light
good
no
doubt
ragu
grunted
place
is
very
clean
and
very
large
and
ever
so
much
better
than
our
dirty
dens
of
former
times
where
we
found
ourselves
like
pigs
in
their
styes
there
has
certainly
been
a
good
deal
of
progress
but
the
worry
is
that
one
has
yet
found
a
way
to
give
each
man
an
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
but
we
have
our
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
retorted
bonnaire
jestingly
come
and
see
then
he
took
the
other
to
the
general
stores
great
barns
huge
granaries
vast
magazines
where
all
the
produce
and
wealth
of
the
city
was
accumulated
they
had
been
enlarged
perforce
year
by
year
for
one
no
longer
knew
where
to
store
the
crops
and
indeed
it
had
even
been
necessary
to
check
the
production
of
manufactured
goods
to
avoid
encumbrance
nowhere
else
could
one
better
realise
what
an
incalculable
fortune
a
nation
might
amass
when
all
intermediaries
were
done
away
with
the
drones
and
the
thieves
all
those
who
had
lived
upon
the
work
of
others
without
producing
anything
themselves
are
our
rentes
bonnaire
repeated
of
us
can
help
himself
here
without
counting
and
do
you
think
that
it
all
represents
a
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
happy
life
for
each
of
us
we
are
all
equally
rich
it
true
and
as
you
have
said
that
would
spoil
your
pleasure
fortune
being
nothing
to
you
unless
it
be
seasoned
with
the
misery
of
others
yet
it
has
an
advantage
for
one
no
longer
incurs
the
risk
of
being
robbed
or
murdered
some
evening
at
a
street
corner
just
for
the
sake
of
gain
then
he
mentioned
a
movement
that
was
setting
in
quite
apart
from
the
working
of
the
general
stores
that
is
a
movement
of
direct
exchange
between
producers
a
movement
which
had
originated
among
the
petty
family
workshops
perhaps
then
the
great
workshops
and
the
huge
general
stores
would
end
by
disappearing
in
the
course
of
the
advance
towards
increase
of
liberty
the
sovereign
freedom
of
the
individual
amidst
the
freedom
of
all
mankind
ragu
listened
more
and
more
upset
by
that
conquest
of
happiness
which
he
still
wished
to
deny
and
at
a
loss
as
to
how
he
might
hide
the
fact
that
he
was
sorely
shaken
he
exclaimed
you
an
anarchist
now
this
time
bonnaire
burst
into
noisy
merriment
my
good
fellow
i
used
to
be
a
collectivist
and
you
reproached
me
for
having
ceased
to
be
one
now
you
make
an
anarchist
of
me
but
the
truth
is
that
we
are
no
longer
anything
at
all
since
the
common
dream
of
happiness
truth
and
justice
has
been
realised
but
now
that
i
think
of
it
come
a
little
way
with
me
and
see
something
else
by
way
of
finishing
up
our
visit
he
led
him
to
the
rear
of
the
general
stores
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
ridge
to
the
very
spot
indeed
where
lange
the
potter
had
formerly
installed
his
rudimentary
kilns
in
an
enclosure
barricaded
with
dry
stones
a
large
building
stood
there
a
manufactory
of
stoneware
and
faÃ¯ence
whence
came
the
enamelled
bricks
and
tiles
the
thousand
decorations
which
adorned
the
whole
city
yielding
indeed
to
the
friendly
entreaties
of
luc
and
seeing
a
little
equity
arise
to
relieve
the
misery
of
the
people
lange
had
decided
to
take
some
pupils
since
the
masses
were
reviving
to
joy
he
would
be
able
to
realise
an
old
dream
of
his
by
making
and
scattering
broadcast
all
the
bright
earthenware
glowing
like
golden
wheatears
cornflowers
and
poppies
with
which
he
had
so
long
desired
to
enliven
the
peeping
out
of
the
garden
greenery
and
beauty
had
blossomed
forth
under
the
touch
of
his
big
genial
hands
beauty
in
an
admirable
form
of
art
coming
from
the
people
and
returning
to
it
instinct
with
all
the
popular
primitive
strength
and
grace
he
had
not
renounced
the
making
of
humble
utensils
kitchen
and
table
pottery
pans
pots
pitchers
and
plates
all
exquisite
in
form
and
colour
setting
the
glorious
charm
of
art
in
the
most
commonplace
daily
life
but
he
had
each
year
increased
his
production
adorning
the
public
buildings
with
superb
friezes
peopling
the
promenades
with
graceful
statues
setting
up
in
the
squares
lofty
fountains
which
looked
like
nosegays
and
whence
the
water
of
the
springs
flowed
with
all
the
freshness
of
eternal
youth
and
the
band
of
artists
whom
he
had
created
in
his
own
image
now
set
the
beauty
of
art
in
the
very
pots
which
the
housewives
used
as
receptacles
for
their
preserves
and
jam
as
it
happened
lange
was
at
the
top
of
the
little
flight
of
steps
on
the
threshold
of
the
factory
although
he
had
nearly
completed
his
year
his
short
squat
figure
had
remained
robust
he
still
had
the
same
square
head
bushy
with
hair
and
beard
now
white
like
snow
but
at
present
all
the
kindliness
long
hidden
beneath
his
rough
bark
gleamed
from
his
eyes
in
clear
smiles
a
party
of
playful
children
stood
before
him
boys
and
girls
who
pushed
one
another
and
stretched
out
their
hands
whilst
he
went
on
with
a
distribution
of
little
presents
as
was
indeed
his
habit
every
day
he
thus
apportioned
among
them
some
little
clay
figures
modelled
with
a
few
thumbstrokes
coloured
and
baked
by
the
gross
yet
very
graceful
and
in
some
instances
charmingly
comical
they
represented
the
most
simple
subjects
everyday
occupations
the
petty
incidents
and
fugitive
delights
of
the
passing
hour
there
were
children
laughing
or
crying
young
girls
attending
to
their
household
duties
men
at
work
in
fact
all
life
in
its
everlasting
marvellous
florescence
come
my
children
said
lange
be
in
a
hurry
there
are
enough
for
all
of
you
here
my
pet
take
this
little
girl
putting
on
her
stockings
and
for
you
my
lad
here
this
boy
coming
back
from
school
ah
you
little
darky
yonder
take
this
smith
with
his
hammer
he
shouted
and
laughed
vastly
amusing
himself
in
the
midst
of
all
those
children
who
struggled
for
the
possession
of
his
exquisite
little
figures
be
careful
he
cried
must
not
break
them
put
them
in
your
rooms
so
that
you
may
have
some
pretty
colours
and
pleasant
lines
before
your
eyes
and
in
that
wise
when
you
grow
up
you
will
love
what
beautiful
and
good
and
be
handsome
and
good
yourselves
it
was
his
theory
that
the
people
needed
beauty
in
order
to
become
healthy
and
brotherly
everything
that
surrounded
them
particularly
all
objects
of
current
use
utensils
furniture
and
dwellings
ought
to
suggest
beauty
and
belief
in
the
superiority
of
aristocratic
art
was
imbecile
the
greatest
most
touching
and
most
human
art
was
that
into
which
most
life
entered
moreover
the
work
that
proved
immortal
and
defied
the
centuries
was
one
that
sprang
from
the
multitude
and
summed
up
for
it
an
epoch
or
a
civilisation
and
it
was
ever
from
the
people
that
art
flowered
forth
in
order
that
it
might
embellish
the
people
themselves
and
impart
to
them
the
perfume
and
the
radiance
which
were
as
necessary
to
their
life
as
was
daily
bread
here
a
peasant
reaping
and
a
woman
washing
linen
take
that
one
my
big
lassie
and
you
my
little
man
there
one
for
you
well
it
over
now
mind
you
are
very
good
kiss
your
mammas
and
papas
for
me
ah
my
little
lambs
my
little
chicks
life
is
beautiful
life
is
good
ragu
had
listened
motionless
and
silent
but
he
was
evidently
more
and
more
surprised
at
last
with
a
ferocious
sneer
he
exploded
master
anarchist
said
he
you
no
longer
talk
of
blowing
up
the
whole
show
eh
lange
turned
sharply
and
looked
at
ragu
without
recognising
him
however
he
displayed
no
anger
but
simply
began
to
laugh
again
so
you
know
me
he
said
what
your
name
is
i
ca
remember
well
yes
it
true
i
did
wish
to
blow
up
the
whole
show
i
cried
it
everywhere
to
all
the
winds
of
the
sky
and
i
heaped
malediction
after
malediction
upon
the
accursed
city
announcing
its
approaching
destruction
by
iron
and
fire
i
had
even
resolved
to
do
justice
myself
and
raze
beauclair
as
by
lightning
but
things
turned
out
otherwise
enough
justice
came
to
disarm
me
the
town
was
purified
and
rebuilt
and
i
ca
destroy
it
now
that
all
i
wanted
all
i
dreamt
of
is
being
realised
is
that
so
bonnaire
we
made
peace
eh
thereupon
lange
the
former
anarchist
held
out
his
hand
to
the
with
whom
he
had
once
had
such
bitter
quarrels
were
ready
to
eat
one
another
were
we
not
bonnaire
he
resumed
agreed
as
to
the
city
of
liberty
equity
and
cordial
understanding
which
we
wished
to
reach
only
we
differed
as
to
the
best
road
to
follow
and
those
who
thought
that
they
ought
to
turn
to
the
right
were
ready
to
massacre
those
who
showed
a
desire
to
turn
to
the
left
but
now
that
we
all
reached
our
destination
it
would
be
too
stupid
of
us
to
continue
quarrelling
is
that
not
so
bonnaire
as
i
said
before
peace
is
made
bonnaire
who
had
retained
the
potter
hand
in
his
grasp
pressed
and
shook
it
affectionately
yes
lange
he
replied
did
wrong
in
not
coming
to
an
understanding
it
was
perhaps
that
which
prevented
us
from
making
progress
or
perhaps
we
were
all
right
since
now
here
we
are
hand
in
hand
willing
to
admit
that
at
bottom
we
all
wanted
the
same
thing
if
things
are
not
yet
altogether
such
as
absolute
justice
would
require
lange
resumed
can
rely
on
those
lads
and
lassies
to
continue
the
work
and
some
day
finish
it
you
hear
my
little
chicks
my
little
lambs
love
each
other
well
the
shouting
and
laughing
was
beginning
afresh
when
ragu
in
his
brutal
fashion
intervened
once
more
i
say
you
spoilt
anarchist
what
about
your
barefeet
have
you
made
her
your
wife
eh
tears
started
to
lange
eyes
nearly
twenty
years
previously
the
tall
and
beautiful
creature
whom
he
had
compassionately
picked
up
on
the
roads
and
who
had
worshipped
him
like
a
slave
had
died
in
his
arms
the
victim
of
a
frightful
and
mysterious
accident
he
had
spoken
of
an
explosion
in
one
of
his
kilns
saying
that
its
iron
door
had
been
carried
away
and
had
struck
barefeet
full
in
the
bosom
but
the
truth
was
assuredly
different
she
had
assisted
him
in
his
experiments
with
explosives
and
must
have
been
struck
down
during
some
attempts
to
charge
those
famous
little
of
which
he
had
spoken
so
complacently
intending
to
deposit
them
at
the
the
the
in
all
the
places
indeed
where
there
was
any
form
of
authority
to
be
destroyed
for
months
and
for
years
that
tragic
death
had
made
lange
heart
bleed
and
even
nowadays
after
the
attainment
of
so
much
happiness
he
still
wept
for
the
loss
of
that
gentle
yet
impassioned
woman
who
in
return
for
the
alms
of
a
piece
of
bread
had
for
ever
bestowed
on
him
the
royal
gift
of
her
beauty
he
strode
roughly
towards
ragu
are
a
bad
man
he
cried
do
you
stab
me
in
the
heart
like
that
who
are
you
where
have
you
sprung
from
do
you
know
that
my
dear
wife
is
dead
and
that
every
evening
i
still
ask
her
forgiveness
accusing
myself
of
having
caused
her
death
if
i
have
become
a
bad
man
i
owe
it
to
her
dear
memory
for
she
is
always
with
me
she
is
my
good
counsellor
but
you
you
are
a
bad
man
i
do
want
to
recognise
you
i
do
want
to
know
your
name
go
away
go
away
from
our
city
he
was
superb
in
his
dolorous
violence
the
poetic
spirit
that
dwelt
within
his
rugged
form
and
which
had
formerly
manifested
itself
in
vengeful
flights
of
fancy
of
a
sombre
grandeur
had
now
softened
tempering
his
heart
with
infinite
quivering
kindliness
you
recognised
him
then
asked
bonnaire
anxiously
is
he
tell
me
do
not
wish
to
recognise
him
lange
repeated
yet
more
rigorously
shall
not
say
anything
let
him
go
his
way
let
him
go
his
way
at
once
he
is
fit
to
be
one
of
us
thereupon
bonnaire
feeling
convinced
that
the
potter
had
recognised
ragu
gently
led
the
latter
away
in
order
to
avoid
any
painful
explanations
for
his
part
ragu
evinced
no
desire
to
linger
and
quarrel
but
retired
in
silence
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
had
dealt
him
blow
after
blow
in
the
heart
filling
him
with
bitter
regret
and
boundless
envy
he
had
begun
to
stagger
beneath
the
shock
of
that
happiness
in
which
he
had
not
and
would
never
have
the
slightest
part
but
it
was
particularly
the
aspect
of
beauclair
in
the
evening
that
upset
him
it
had
become
a
custom
for
each
family
to
set
its
table
in
the
street
and
dine
there
on
that
first
day
of
summer
the
repast
was
like
a
fraternal
communion
of
the
whole
city
the
bread
was
broken
and
the
wine
was
drunk
in
public
and
the
tables
were
at
last
brought
together
in
such
wise
that
they
formed
but
one
table
the
whole
town
changing
into
a
vast
where
the
people
became
one
sole
family
at
seven
whilst
the
sun
was
still
shining
the
tables
were
set
out
decorated
with
roses
that
rain
of
roses
which
had
perfumed
beauclair
ever
since
the
morning
the
white
cloths
the
decorated
crockery
the
glass
and
the
silver
reflected
the
purple
glow
of
the
sunset
as
silver
money
like
gold
money
was
fast
disappearing
each
now
had
his
or
her
silver
goblet
even
as
in
olden
time
one
had
goblets
or
mugs
of
pewter
and
bonnaire
insisted
on
ragu
taking
his
seat
at
his
table
or
rather
at
that
of
his
granddaughter
claudine
who
had
married
luc
son
charles
froment
have
brought
you
a
guest
he
simply
said
to
the
others
without
naming
ragu
is
a
stranger
a
friend
and
all
made
answer
is
welcome
bonnaire
kept
ragu
near
him
but
the
table
was
a
long
one
for
four
generations
elbowed
one
another
when
bonnaire
the
patriarch
looked
round
he
could
see
his
son
lucien
and
his
louise
mazelle
both
of
whom
were
now
over
fifty
he
could
also
see
his
granddaughter
claudine
and
his
charles
froment
both
in
their
prime
and
he
could
likewise
see
his
alice
a
charming
little
maid
eight
years
of
age
and
all
manner
of
kith
and
kin
followed
bonnaire
explained
to
ragu
that
a
gigantic
table
would
have
been
needed
if
his
three
other
children
antoinette
zoÃ©
and
sÃ©verin
had
not
arranged
to
dine
at
other
tables
with
their
own
offspring
at
dessert
however
they
would
bring
the
tables
together
in
a
neighbourly
fashion
in
suchwise
that
they
would
end
by
being
all
together
ragu
more
particularly
turned
his
eyes
upon
louise
mazelle
who
still
looked
very
charming
and
active
he
was
no
doubt
surprised
by
the
sight
of
that
daughter
of
the
who
invariably
displayed
so
much
affection
for
her
husband
lucien
the
scion
of
a
stock
leaning
towards
bonnaire
the
old
vagabond
at
last
asked
him
in
an
undertone
the
mazelles
dead
then
the
dread
of
losing
their
money
killed
them
the
conversions
which
upset
everything
and
foreshadowed
the
approaching
suppression
of
rentes
altogether
fell
upon
them
like
so
many
thunderbolts
the
husband
was
the
first
to
die
killed
by
the
idea
that
his
idle
days
were
over
and
that
he
would
perhaps
have
to
work
again
then
the
wife
dragged
on
for
a
while
cloistering
herself
at
home
and
no
longer
daring
to
go
out
convinced
as
she
was
that
as
violent
hands
had
been
laid
on
rentes
people
must
nowadays
be
murdered
at
every
it
was
in
vain
that
her
daughter
proposed
to
take
her
with
her
she
stifled
at
the
thought
of
being
fed
by
others
and
at
last
one
day
she
was
found
dead
stricken
by
apoplexy
her
face
quite
black
and
resting
among
a
package
of
her
rente
certificates
which
had
virtually
lost
all
value
poor
people
they
died
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
absolutely
overcome
and
declaring
that
the
world
had
been
turned
ragu
wagged
his
head
he
was
not
inclined
to
weep
for
those
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
of
opinion
that
a
world
whence
idleness
was
banished
was
not
worth
living
in
then
he
again
looked
round
him
and
became
yet
gloomier
as
he
noticed
the
rising
spirits
of
one
and
all
and
the
abundance
and
luxury
which
prevailed
at
the
table
though
to
the
others
those
things
were
now
only
natural
and
gave
no
cause
for
vanity
the
women
were
all
arrayed
in
similar
festive
garb
similar
light
charming
silks
and
precious
stones
rubies
and
sapphires
and
emeralds
glittered
in
the
hair
of
all
but
the
roses
the
superb
roses
were
preferred
to
the
gems
by
far
for
they
lived
and
were
therefore
the
more
precious
already
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
which
was
made
up
of
delicate
and
simple
viands
vegetables
and
fruit
especially
everything
being
served
on
silver
dishes
joyous
songs
began
to
arise
saluting
the
setting
sun
and
bidding
it
in
the
certainty
that
in
a
few
hours
time
it
would
happily
arise
again
and
all
at
once
amidst
the
singing
a
delightful
incident
occurred
all
the
birds
of
the
neighbourhood
the
robins
the
blackcaps
the
finches
even
the
sparrows
flew
down
on
the
tables
before
retiring
to
rest
among
the
darkening
greenery
they
alighted
boldly
on
one
shoulders
hopped
down
to
peck
the
crumbs
on
the
cloth
and
accepted
dainties
from
the
hands
of
the
children
and
the
women
since
beauclair
had
become
a
town
of
concord
and
peace
they
had
been
aware
of
the
change
there
they
no
longer
feared
aught
from
its
kindly
inhabitants
neither
snares
nor
gunshots
and
they
had
grown
familiar
in
their
way
they
formed
part
of
the
various
families
each
garden
had
its
denizens
who
at
flew
down
to
take
their
share
of
the
common
food
here
are
our
little
friends
cried
bonnaire
they
chatter
they
know
very
well
that
is
a
festival
crumble
some
bread
for
them
alice
ragu
with
his
face
darkening
and
a
dolorous
expression
in
his
eyes
watched
the
birds
as
they
flew
down
from
every
side
like
a
very
whirlwind
of
small
light
feathers
to
which
the
last
sunbeams
imparted
a
golden
glow
those
birds
made
the
dessert
quite
lively
so
many
were
the
little
feet
hopping
jauntily
among
the
cherries
and
the
roses
and
of
all
the
felicity
and
splendour
that
ragu
had
witnessed
since
the
morning
nothing
had
so
clearly
and
so
charmingly
told
him
how
peaceful
and
how
happy
was
that
young
community
for
him
it
was
like
a
supreme
blow
he
suddenly
arose
and
said
to
bonnaire
stifling
i
must
walk
about
and
besides
i
want
to
see
everything
all
the
tables
all
the
people
bonnaire
understood
him
well
was
it
not
luc
and
josine
whom
he
wished
to
see
was
not
all
the
ardent
curiosity
that
he
had
displayed
since
his
return
culminating
in
a
desire
to
behold
them
still
avoiding
a
decisive
explanation
bonnaire
answered
well
i
will
show
you
we
will
make
the
round
of
the
tables
the
first
they
reached
the
one
set
out
before
the
next
house
was
that
of
the
morfains
presided
over
it
beside
his
wife
honorine
caffiaux
both
of
them
with
snowy
hair
and
with
them
were
their
son
raymond
their
thÃ©rÃ¨se
froment
and
their
eldest
grandson
maurice
morfain
a
tall
youth
nineteen
years
of
age
already
then
on
the
other
side
came
achille
gourier
line
with
his
widow
whose
large
eyes
retained
all
their
intensity
though
she
was
now
nearly
seventy
years
old
she
would
soon
be
a
through
her
daughter
lÃ©onie
married
to
sÃ©verin
bonnaire
and
her
grandson
fÃ©licien
born
of
that
marriage
and
lately
wedded
to
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
the
daughter
of
pauline
froment
and
andrÃ©
jollivet
all
were
present
even
both
of
the
last
named
who
had
come
with
their
daughter
and
some
of
them
were
making
merry
with
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
suggesting
that
if
her
firstborn
should
be
a
son
he
ought
to
be
called
grÃ©goire
meantime
her
sister
berthe
though
she
was
scarcely
fifteen
already
laughed
at
the
soft
things
said
to
her
by
her
cousin
raymond
thus
offering
promise
of
another
in
the
future
the
arrival
of
bonnaire
was
hailed
with
joyous
acclamations
ragu
who
was
losing
himself
more
and
more
amidst
the
tangle
of
matrimonial
alliances
particularly
desired
that
the
two
froments
seated
at
this
table
should
be
pointed
out
to
him
they
were
two
of
luc
daughters
thÃ©rÃ¨se
and
pauline
both
well
on
the
road
to
their
fortieth
year
but
still
displaying
a
bright
and
healthy
beauty
then
as
the
sight
of
reminded
ragu
of
old
mayor
gourier
and
chÃ¢telard
he
wished
to
know
how
they
had
ended
bonnaire
told
him
that
they
had
passed
away
one
a
few
days
later
than
the
other
after
spending
their
last
years
in
close
intimacy
linked
together
by
the
loss
of
the
beautiful
lÃ©onore
gourier
the
first
to
depart
had
with
difficulty
accustomed
himself
to
the
new
state
of
things
he
had
often
raised
his
arms
to
heaven
in
astonishment
at
being
an
employer
of
labour
no
longer
and
he
had
been
wont
to
talk
of
the
past
with
all
the
melancholy
of
an
aged
man
who
although
he
would
willingly
have
devoured
the
priests
in
former
days
had
actually
begun
to
regret
the
ceremonies
of
the
catholic
church
the
first
communions
and
processions
the
incense
and
the
pealing
bells
chÃ¢telard
on
the
other
hand
had
gallantly
fallen
asleep
in
the
skin
of
an
anarchist
for
such
he
had
gradually
become
in
the
midst
of
his
diplomatic
reserve
accomplishing
his
destiny
such
as
he
had
wished
it
to
be
living
happy
and
forgotten
in
the
midst
of
that
beauclair
which
was
now
rebuilt
and
triumphant
and
at
last
disappearing
in
silence
with
the
whose
funeral
procession
he
had
so
complacently
followed
he
himself
swallowed
up
as
it
were
in
the
collapse
of
the
last
ministry
but
there
was
a
finer
a
more
noble
death
to
be
mentioned
the
death
of
judge
gaume
which
was
recalled
by
the
presence
at
that
table
of
his
grandson
andrÃ©
and
his
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
and
berthe
alone
with
his
grandson
gaume
had
lived
to
the
age
of
in
all
the
desolation
of
his
spoilt
and
dolorous
life
on
the
day
however
when
the
law
courts
and
the
prison
were
closed
he
had
felt
himself
in
a
measure
delivered
from
the
haunting
torture
of
his
career
as
a
judge
a
man
judging
men
consenting
to
play
the
part
of
infallible
truth
absolute
justice
in
spite
of
all
the
possible
infirmities
of
his
mind
and
his
heart
the
thought
of
it
made
gaume
shudder
filled
him
with
excessive
scruples
dreadful
remorse
terror
lest
he
should
indeed
have
been
a
bad
judge
however
the
justice
which
he
had
long
awaited
which
he
had
feared
he
might
never
see
had
dawned
at
last
not
the
justice
of
an
iniquitous
social
system
reigning
with
the
sword
with
which
it
defends
a
small
minority
of
despoilers
and
with
which
it
strikes
the
great
multitude
of
wretched
slaves
but
justice
as
between
free
man
and
free
man
justice
allotting
to
each
his
share
of
legitimate
happiness
and
bringing
in
its
train
truth
and
brotherliness
and
peace
on
the
morning
of
the
day
he
died
gauine
sent
for
an
old
poacher
whom
he
had
formerly
condemned
to
a
heavy
punishment
for
killing
a
gendarme
who
had
dealt
him
a
sabre
stroke
and
he
publicly
expressed
his
contrition
and
cried
aloud
all
the
doubts
which
had
poisoned
his
career
he
proclaimed
all
the
crimes
of
the
code
all
the
errors
and
falsehoods
of
the
statutes
those
weapons
of
social
oppression
and
hatred
those
corrupt
foundations
of
the
social
system
whence
spring
perfect
epidemics
of
theft
and
murder
so
ragu
resumed
young
folk
seated
at
that
table
that
fÃ©licien
and
his
wife
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
at
whose
house
we
called
this
morning
are
at
once
the
grandchildren
of
the
froments
the
morfains
the
jollivets
and
the
gaumes
but
does
the
blood
of
such
enemies
poison
those
in
whose
veins
it
now
flows
indeed
bonnaire
quietly
replied
commingling
of
blood
has
brought
reconciliation
and
the
race
has
acquired
more
beauty
and
strength
from
it
fresh
bitterness
awaited
ragu
at
the
next
table
that
of
bourron
his
old
chum
the
boon
companion
of
his
days
of
sloth
and
drunkenness
whom
he
had
ruled
and
led
astray
so
easily
the
idea
of
it
bourron
happy
bourron
saved
when
he
himself
remained
in
his
hell
in
spite
of
his
many
years
bourron
did
indeed
look
quite
triumphant
as
he
sat
there
beside
his
wife
babette
she
who
had
ever
remained
cheerful
whose
unchangeable
hopes
and
optimism
had
found
fulfilment
without
even
moving
her
to
astonishment
was
it
not
natural
one
was
happy
because
one
always
ends
by
being
happy
and
around
the
bourrons
there
had
been
no
limit
to
the
swarming
of
offspring
there
was
first
their
eldest
daughter
marthe
who
had
married
auguste
laboque
and
had
given
birth
to
adolphe
who
in
his
turn
had
married
germaine
the
daughter
of
zoÃ©
bonnaire
and
nicholas
yvonnot
there
was
next
their
son
sÃ©bastien
who
had
married
agathe
fauchard
and
had
begotten
clÃ©mentine
who
on
her
side
had
married
alexandre
feuillat
the
son
of
lÃ©on
feuillat
and
of
eugÃ©nie
yvonnot
the
fourth
generation
proceeding
from
those
two
branches
of
family
was
already
represented
by
two
little
girls
simonne
laboque
and
amÃ©lie
feuillat
each
of
them
in
their
fifth
year
and
by
virtue
of
the
kinship
established
by
marriage
the
party
further
included
louis
fauchard
married
to
julienne
dacheux
who
had
given
him
a
daughter
laure
and
Ã©variste
mitaine
married
to
olympe
lenfant
by
whom
he
had
had
a
son
hippolyte
then
there
was
the
aforesaid
hippolyte
himself
now
the
husband
of
laure
fauchard
and
the
father
of
a
lad
in
his
eighth
year
named
franÃ§ois
in
such
wise
that
the
fourth
generation
was
sprouting
vigorously
on
this
side
also
throughout
festive
beauclair
one
could
not
have
found
a
larger
table
than
that
where
intermingled
the
descendants
of
the
bourrons
the
laboques
the
bonnaires
the
yvonnots
the
fauchards
the
feuillats
the
dacheux
the
lenfants
and
the
mitaines
bonnaire
who
here
again
found
one
of
his
own
children
zoÃ©
gave
ragu
some
particulars
respecting
those
whom
death
had
carried
off
old
fauchard
and
his
wife
natalie
he
always
in
a
state
of
stupor
and
she
always
complaining
had
gone
off
without
understanding
the
great
changes
which
were
taking
place
feuillat
on
his
side
had
beheld
the
triumph
of
his
work
that
vast
estate
of
les
combettes
ere
he
departed
lenfant
and
yvonnot
had
lately
followed
him
to
their
graves
in
that
earth
which
was
now
loved
with
intelligence
and
fertilised
with
virile
power
and
after
the
dacheux
the
caffiaux
and
the
laboques
those
relics
of
the
vanished
trading
system
the
beautiful
bakeress
the
good
madame
mitaine
had
passed
away
full
of
years
kindliness
and
beauty
but
ragu
was
no
longer
listening
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
bourron
looks
quite
young
he
muttered
his
babette
still
has
her
pretty
laugh
he
recalled
the
sprees
of
other
days
bourron
and
he
lingering
late
in
caffiaux
den
railing
against
the
masters
and
at
last
staggering
home
dead
drunk
and
he
recalled
his
own
long
life
of
wretchedness
the
fifty
years
that
he
had
squandered
in
rolling
from
workshop
to
workshop
through
the
world
the
experiment
had
been
made
and
made
successfully
work
reorganised
and
regenerated
had
saved
his
old
chum
when
he
was
already
half
lost
whereas
he
ragu
had
come
back
annihilated
by
the
old
labour
system
full
of
misery
and
suffering
that
iniquitous
which
poisoned
and
destroyed
all
at
once
there
came
a
charming
incident
which
brought
ragu
anguish
to
a
climax
simonne
laboque
the
daughter
of
adolphe
and
germaine
a
little
maid
about
five
years
old
took
some
rose
petals
scattered
over
the
table
in
her
chubby
little
hands
and
smilingly
poured
them
over
her
white
head
grandpa
bourron
there
you
are
and
there
some
more
to
make
you
a
crown
oh
you
some
in
your
hair
and
in
your
ears
and
on
your
nose
too
you
some
everywhere
and
fÃªte
bonne
grandpa
bourron
the
whole
table
laughed
applauded
and
acclaimed
the
old
man
but
ragu
fled
dragging
bonnaire
with
him
he
was
trembling
he
could
scarcely
remain
erect
when
they
had
got
a
little
distance
away
however
he
suddenly
said
to
bonnaire
in
a
husky
voice
what
the
use
of
keeping
it
back
any
longer
i
only
came
to
see
where
are
they
show
them
me
he
was
speaking
of
luc
and
josine
and
as
bonnaire
who
had
fully
understood
it
delayed
replying
he
continued
have
been
taking
me
about
ever
since
this
morning
and
i
have
seemed
to
be
interested
in
everything
yet
i
can
only
think
of
them
it
was
the
thought
of
them
indeed
that
brought
me
back
here
amidst
so
much
fatigue
and
suffering
i
heard
while
i
was
far
away
that
i
had
killed
him
they
are
both
still
alive
are
they
not
they
have
had
several
children
they
are
happy
triumphant
is
that
not
so
bonnaire
was
reflecting
for
fear
of
a
scandal
he
had
hitherto
delayed
the
inevitable
meeting
but
had
not
his
tactics
succeeded
had
not
a
kind
of
holy
awe
come
over
ragu
in
presence
of
the
grandeur
of
the
accomplished
work
bonnaire
could
tell
that
his
companion
was
quivering
distracted
too
nerveless
to
think
of
committing
another
crime
and
so
with
his
air
of
serene
good
nature
he
finished
by
replying
want
to
see
them
my
good
fellow
well
i
will
show
them
to
you
and
it
quite
true
you
will
see
happy
folk
luc
table
came
immediately
after
that
of
bourron
he
sat
on
one
side
of
it
in
the
centre
with
josine
on
his
right
whilst
on
his
left
hand
were
sÅurette
and
jordan
suzanne
also
was
present
seated
in
front
of
luc
and
near
her
nanet
and
nise
had
taken
their
places
they
in
their
turn
would
soon
be
but
their
eyes
still
laughed
under
their
fair
hair
which
had
now
become
somewhat
paler
in
hue
as
in
the
distant
days
when
they
had
looked
like
two
little
toys
two
little
curly
lambs
all
around
the
table
sat
the
younger
members
of
luc
family
there
was
hilaire
his
eldest
son
who
had
married
colette
the
daughter
of
nanette
and
nise
and
had
become
the
father
of
mariette
now
nearly
fifteen
years
of
age
in
like
manner
from
paul
boisgelin
and
antoinette
bonnaire
had
sprung
ludovic
who
would
soon
be
twenty
and
there
was
a
promise
of
marriage
between
ludovic
and
mariette
who
dined
side
by
side
spending
much
of
their
time
in
whispering
together
having
little
secrets
of
their
own
to
communicate
then
came
jules
the
last
of
the
froments
who
had
married
cÃ©line
the
daughter
of
arsÃ¨ne
lenfant
and
eulalie
laboque
this
pair
having
a
boy
of
six
named
richard
a
child
of
angelic
beauty
the
particular
favourite
of
his
grandfather
luc
and
afterwards
followed
all
the
kinsfolk
this
being
the
table
where
the
blood
of
enemies
was
most
closely
blended
that
of
the
froments
the
boisgelins
and
the
delaveaus
mingling
with
that
of
the
bonnaires
the
laboques
and
the
lenfants
the
artisans
traders
and
tillers
of
the
soil
in
such
wise
that
the
whole
social
communion
whence
the
new
city
the
beauclair
of
justice
and
peace
had
sprung
was
represented
here
at
the
moment
when
ragu
drew
near
to
the
table
a
last
ray
of
the
setting
sun
enveloped
it
as
with
a
glory
and
the
clumps
of
roses
the
silver
plate
the
light
silk
gowns
and
the
hair
of
the
women
coruscated
amidst
the
splendour
but
the
most
charming
incident
that
attended
the
orb
farewell
was
another
flight
of
the
birds
of
the
vicinity
who
yet
once
again
flew
around
the
diners
before
retiring
to
rest
among
the
branches
there
came
such
coveys
and
such
a
flapping
of
little
wings
that
the
table
was
covered
as
with
a
snow
of
warm
living
down
friendly
hands
took
hold
of
the
birds
caressed
them
and
then
let
them
go
and
the
confidence
thus
displayed
by
the
robins
and
the
finches
was
fraught
with
adorable
sweetness
in
that
calm
evening
atmosphere
it
seemed
like
a
sign
that
an
alliance
was
henceforth
formed
between
all
creatures
that
universal
peace
reigned
at
last
between
men
and
animals
and
things
grandpa
luc
cried
little
richard
look
there
is
a
blackcap
drinking
water
out
of
grandma
josine
glass
it
was
true
and
luc
the
founder
of
the
city
felt
both
amused
and
touched
by
it
the
water
came
from
those
fresh
and
pure
springs
which
he
had
captured
among
the
rocks
of
the
bleuse
mountains
and
which
had
given
birth
to
the
whole
town
of
gardens
and
avenues
and
plashing
fountains
when
the
bird
had
flown
away
luc
took
up
the
glass
and
raised
it
amidst
the
purple
glow
of
the
sunset
saying
we
must
drink
we
must
drink
to
the
health
of
our
happy
city
and
when
josine
who
all
her
life
had
remained
an
a
creature
of
tender
heart
beneath
her
white
hair
had
laughingly
moistened
her
lips
with
the
water
luc
in
his
turn
drank
of
it
and
resumed
the
health
of
our
city
whose
it
is
may
it
ever
increase
and
spread
may
it
grow
in
liberty
prosperity
and
beauty
and
may
it
win
the
whole
world
over
to
the
work
of
universal
harmony
in
the
last
sunray
which
set
an
aureola
round
his
head
he
looked
superb
still
young
even
overflowing
with
triumphant
faith
and
joy
without
pride
or
emphasis
he
simply
expressed
the
delight
he
felt
at
seeing
his
work
so
full
of
life
and
strength
he
was
the
founder
the
creator
the
father
and
all
those
joyous
people
all
who
sat
at
those
tables
celebrating
work
and
the
fruitfulness
of
summer
were
his
people
his
friends
his
kinsfolk
his
brotherly
and
prosperous
family
an
acclamation
greeted
the
ardently
loving
wishes
which
he
offered
up
for
his
city
ascending
into
the
evening
air
and
rolling
from
table
to
table
even
to
the
most
distant
avenues
one
and
all
had
risen
to
their
feet
in
their
turn
holding
their
glasses
aloft
and
drinking
the
health
of
luc
and
josine
the
heroes
the
patriarchs
of
work
she
the
redeemed
one
glorified
as
spouse
and
as
mother
and
he
the
saviour
who
to
save
her
had
saved
the
whole
wretched
world
of
the
from
iniquity
and
suffering
and
it
was
a
moment
full
of
exaltation
and
magnificence
testifying
to
the
passionate
gratitude
of
the
vast
throng
for
all
the
active
faith
which
had
been
shown
and
proclaiming
the
community
final
entry
into
the
reign
of
glory
and
love
ragu
turned
ghastly
pale
and
trembled
in
all
his
limbs
as
that
gust
of
triumph
swept
by
he
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
luc
and
josine
so
radiant
with
beauty
and
kindliness
he
recoiled
and
staggered
and
was
on
the
point
of
fleeing
when
luc
who
had
noticed
him
turned
towards
bonnaire
my
friend
you
were
lacking
to
make
my
joy
complete
said
he
have
ever
been
like
my
other
self
the
bravest
sturdiest
most
sensible
artisan
of
our
work
and
people
must
not
praise
me
without
praising
you
also
but
who
is
that
old
man
that
i
see
with
you
is
a
stranger
stranger
let
him
approach
then
let
him
break
with
us
the
bread
of
our
harvests
and
drink
the
water
of
our
springs
our
city
is
a
city
of
welcome
and
peace
for
all
men
make
room
josine
and
you
friend
whom
we
do
not
know
come
seat
yourself
between
my
wife
and
me
for
we
should
like
to
honour
in
you
all
our
unknown
brothers
of
the
other
cities
of
the
world
but
ragu
as
if
seized
with
holy
horror
retreated
yet
farther
away
no
i
can
not
not
luc
gently
asked
you
come
from
afar
if
you
are
weary
you
will
here
find
helping
and
comforting
hands
we
ask
you
neither
your
name
nor
your
past
here
all
is
forgiven
brotherliness
reigns
alone
in
order
that
the
happiness
of
all
may
produce
the
happiness
of
each
and
you
dear
wife
repeat
all
that
to
him
the
words
will
come
gently
and
convincingly
from
your
lips
for
it
seems
as
if
i
only
frighten
him
thereupon
josine
herself
spoke
my
friend
said
she
is
our
glass
why
should
you
not
drink
our
health
and
your
own
you
come
from
afar
and
you
are
a
brother
in
you
we
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
still
enlarging
our
family
it
is
a
custom
at
beauclair
now
on
days
of
festival
to
exchange
a
kiss
of
peace
which
effaces
everything
take
this
glass
and
drink
for
the
love
of
all
but
ragu
again
recoiled
paler
and
trembling
more
violently
than
before
stricken
with
terror
indeed
as
at
some
idea
of
sacrilege
no
i
can
not
did
luc
and
josine
at
that
moment
suspect
the
truth
did
they
recognise
the
wretched
man
who
had
returned
merely
to
experience
fresh
suffering
after
so
long
dragging
about
with
him
his
destiny
of
sloth
and
corruption
as
they
looked
at
him
an
expression
of
deep
sadness
came
into
their
eyes
which
had
beamed
so
kindly
and
by
way
of
conclusion
luc
simply
said
then
since
you
desire
it
since
you
can
not
belong
to
our
family
at
the
hour
when
it
is
drawing
yet
more
closely
together
pressing
around
on
all
sides
hand
in
hand
look
it
is
mingling
tables
are
joining
tables
and
soon
there
will
be
but
one
board
for
the
whole
of
our
city
of
brothers
this
was
true
the
people
were
gathering
together
in
neighbourly
fashion
each
table
seemed
to
set
out
on
the
march
towards
the
next
one
in
such
wise
that
they
all
met
and
joined
as
invariably
happened
at
the
close
of
that
repast
in
honour
of
the
festival
of
summer
and
it
was
all
quite
natural
the
children
at
first
served
as
messengers
going
from
table
to
table
for
there
was
a
tendency
among
the
scattered
members
of
particular
families
to
gather
together
and
seat
themselves
side
by
side
how
could
sÃ©verin
bonnaire
who
sat
at
the
table
of
the
morfains
zoÃ©
bonnaire
who
sat
at
that
of
the
bourrons
and
antoinette
bonnaire
who
sat
at
that
of
luc
help
feeling
drawn
towards
the
paternal
table
where
their
elder
brother
lucien
had
his
place
and
was
it
not
natural
that
the
froments
scattered
like
the
seed
corn
which
one
casts
into
different
furrows
charles
being
among
the
bonnaires
thÃ©rÃ¨se
and
pauline
among
the
morfains
should
desire
to
join
their
father
the
founder
and
creator
of
the
city
thus
one
beheld
the
tables
marching
and
uniting
together
in
such
wise
that
not
a
break
soon
remained
along
the
avenues
before
the
doors
of
the
gay
houses
the
paschal
feast
of
that
brotherly
people
was
about
to
continue
under
the
stars
in
a
vast
communion
all
being
seated
elbow
to
elbow
at
the
same
board
among
the
same
scattered
rose
petals
the
whole
city
thus
became
a
gigantic
the
families
were
blended
into
one
the
same
spirit
animated
every
breast
and
the
same
love
made
every
heart
beat
meantime
from
the
pure
heavens
fell
a
delightful
sovereign
peace
the
harmony
of
spheres
and
men
bonnaire
had
not
intervened
but
he
had
kept
his
eyes
on
ragu
watching
for
the
change
that
he
expected
after
that
day
of
surprises
which
one
by
one
had
shaken
the
wanderer
until
at
last
he
was
terrified
and
transported
by
that
final
blaze
of
glory
at
last
realising
that
he
was
sorely
stricken
and
tottering
bonnaire
gave
him
his
hand
let
us
walk
a
little
he
said
evening
air
is
so
mild
and
tell
me
do
you
now
believe
in
our
happiness
surely
you
must
now
see
that
one
may
work
and
at
the
same
time
be
happy
indeed
joy
and
health
and
perfect
life
are
to
be
found
in
work
to
work
is
to
live
and
only
a
religion
of
suffering
and
death
could
have
made
work
a
curse
and
eternal
sloth
the
happiness
of
heaven
work
is
not
our
master
it
is
the
breath
of
our
lungs
the
blood
of
our
veins
the
one
sole
reason
why
we
love
and
create
and
form
immortal
humanity
but
ragu
as
if
exhausted
by
fatigue
weary
unto
death
amidst
his
defeat
ceased
arguing
leave
me
leave
me
said
he
am
only
a
coward
a
child
would
have
had
more
courage
and
i
hold
myself
in
contempt
then
in
a
whisper
he
went
on
came
to
kill
them
both
ah
that
journey
the
roads
that
followed
the
roads
the
years
of
roaming
through
unknown
lands
with
one
rageful
thought
in
my
heart
that
of
returning
to
beauclair
of
finding
that
man
and
that
woman
once
more
and
of
planting
in
their
flesh
the
knife
i
had
used
so
clumsily
but
you
met
me
amused
me
and
just
now
i
trembled
before
them
and
retreated
like
a
coward
when
i
saw
them
looking
so
beautiful
so
great
so
radiant
bonnaire
shuddered
on
hearing
that
confession
already
on
the
previous
night
he
had
apprehended
a
crime
but
now
at
the
sight
of
the
woeful
wretch
collapse
he
felt
stirred
by
pity
come
you
unhappy
being
he
exclaimed
and
sleep
again
at
my
house
we
see
again
at
your
house
oh
no
no
i
going
i
going
at
once
you
can
not
start
off
at
this
hour
you
are
too
tired
too
weak
why
wo
you
stay
with
us
you
will
become
calmer
you
will
know
our
happiness
no
i
must
start
at
once
at
once
the
potter
said
the
truth
not
of
the
sort
to
make
one
of
you
and
like
some
damned
and
tortured
wretch
full
of
suppressed
wrath
ragu
added
happiness
why
i
ca
bear
the
sight
of
it
it
would
make
me
suffer
too
much
bonnaire
then
ceased
to
insist
secret
horror
and
uneasiness
had
come
over
him
also
in
silence
he
led
ragu
to
his
house
again
and
the
other
unwilling
even
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the
meal
took
up
his
wallet
and
his
staff
not
a
word
was
exchanged
between
them
not
even
a
gesture
of
farewell
bonnaire
watched
the
miserable
old
man
go
off
with
tottering
steps
and
vanish
at
last
far
away
in
the
night
which
was
gradually
falling
it
was
impossible
however
for
ragu
to
lose
sight
of
festive
beauclair
in
a
moment
he
slowly
went
up
the
brias
gorge
and
at
each
step
climbed
higher
and
higher
among
the
rocks
of
the
bleuse
mountains
before
long
he
was
above
the
town
the
whole
of
which
on
turning
round
he
once
more
beheld
the
sky
of
a
dark
yet
pure
blue
was
glittering
with
stars
and
beneath
the
sweetness
of
the
lovely
june
night
the
town
spread
out
like
another
stretch
of
sky
swarming
as
it
were
with
innumerable
little
planets
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
electric
lamps
which
had
just
been
lighted
on
the
banquet
tables
and
amidst
the
greenery
once
more
then
ragu
beheld
those
tables
outlined
so
to
say
with
fire
and
thus
emerging
victoriously
from
the
darkness
they
spread
along
without
end
till
they
filled
the
whole
space
below
him
and
he
could
hear
laughter
and
singing
arising
and
still
and
ever
behold
that
giant
festival
of
a
whole
people
gathered
together
at
table
in
one
sole
brotherly
family
then
he
once
more
sought
to
flee
the
sight
and
ascended
still
higher
but
when
he
next
turned
round
he
again
saw
the
city
glowing
yet
more
brightly
than
before
he
went
higher
still
he
ever
and
ever
climbed
upward
but
at
each
further
ascent
each
time
that
he
turned
round
the
city
seemed
to
have
grown
till
at
last
it
spread
over
the
entire
plain
becoming
like
the
very
heavens
with
its
infinite
expanse
of
sombre
blue
and
glittering
stars
the
sounds
of
laughter
and
of
song
reached
him
more
and
more
distinctly
it
was
as
if
the
whole
great
human
family
were
celebrating
the
joy
of
work
upon
the
fruitful
earth
then
for
the
last
time
he
again
set
out
and
walked
for
hours
and
for
hours
until
he
became
lost
in
the
darkness
v
yet
other
years
rolled
by
and
death
necessary
death
the
good
helpmate
of
eternal
life
performed
his
work
carrying
off
one
by
one
those
who
had
accomplished
their
tasks
bourron
was
the
first
to
go
followed
by
his
wife
babette
who
retained
her
good
humour
to
the
last
then
came
the
turn
of
and
that
of
whose
blue
eyes
partook
of
the
infinite
of
the
blue
heavens
lange
died
too
whilst
putting
the
finishing
touch
to
a
last
little
figure
a
delightful
barefooted
girl
the
very
image
of
the
barefeet
he
had
loved
then
nanet
and
nise
went
off
exchanging
a
last
kiss
whilst
still
young
and
finally
bonnaire
succumbed
like
a
hero
amidst
the
stir
of
work
one
day
when
he
had
repaired
to
the
factory
to
see
a
new
giant
hammer
whose
every
stroke
forged
a
great
piece
of
of
all
their
generation
of
all
the
founders
and
creators
of
triumphant
beauclair
luc
and
jordan
alone
remained
loved
and
surrounded
with
the
affectionate
attentions
of
josine
sÅurette
and
suzanne
it
seemed
as
if
the
three
women
whose
health
and
courage
in
their
old
age
were
marvellous
lived
on
simply
to
be
the
helpmates
and
nurses
of
the
men
since
luc
had
scarcely
been
able
to
walk
his
legs
gradually
failing
him
till
he
was
almost
fastened
to
his
suzanne
had
come
to
reside
in
his
house
lovingly
sharing
with
josine
the
glory
of
waiting
upon
him
he
was
more
than
eighty
now
of
unchangeable
gaiety
and
in
full
possession
of
his
intelligence
quite
young
indeed
as
he
said
with
a
laugh
had
it
not
been
for
those
wretched
legs
of
his
which
were
becoming
like
lead
and
in
the
same
way
sÅurette
did
not
quit
her
brother
jordan
who
now
never
left
his
laboratory
but
worked
there
in
the
and
slept
there
at
night
he
was
luc
elder
by
ten
years
and
had
retained
at
ninety
the
slow
and
methodical
activity
to
which
he
was
indebted
for
the
accomplishment
of
such
a
vast
amount
of
work
ever
seemingly
on
the
point
of
expiring
but
introducing
such
logic
and
such
determination
into
his
labour
that
he
was
still
working
when
the
sturdiest
toilers
of
his
generation
had
long
been
sleeping
in
the
grave
he
had
often
said
in
his
weak
little
voice
die
because
willing
one
does
die
when
one
still
has
something
to
do
my
health
is
very
bad
but
all
the
same
i
shall
live
to
a
good
old
age
i
shall
only
die
on
the
day
when
my
work
is
finished
you
see
you
see
i
shall
know
when
the
time
has
come
and
i
will
warn
you
my
good
friends
saying
my
day
over
i
going
to
sleep
now
thus
jordan
still
worked
because
in
his
estimation
his
work
was
not
yet
finished
he
lived
on
wrapped
in
rugs
his
drinks
were
warmed
in
order
that
he
might
not
catch
cold
and
he
took
long
rests
on
a
couch
between
the
brief
hours
which
he
was
able
to
devote
to
his
researches
two
or
three
such
hours
sufficed
him
however
for
the
accomplishment
of
a
considerable
amount
of
work
in
such
a
methodical
manner
did
he
exert
himself
sÅurette
all
attention
and
abnegation
was
like
his
second
self
at
once
a
nurse
a
secretary
and
a
preparator
allowing
nobody
to
approach
and
disturb
him
on
the
days
moreover
when
his
hands
were
too
weak
for
any
exertion
it
was
she
who
carried
out
his
thoughts
for
him
becoming
as
it
were
a
prolongation
of
his
own
life
to
jordan
thinking
his
work
would
only
be
completed
when
the
new
city
supply
of
beneficent
electricity
should
be
as
unlimited
as
the
inexhaustible
water
of
the
rivers
or
the
air
which
one
can
breathe
in
all
freedom
during
the
past
sixty
years
he
had
accomplished
a
great
deal
of
work
tending
to
that
solution
he
had
diminished
the
cost
of
electricity
by
burning
coals
when
they
quitted
the
pit
and
then
despatching
the
electric
force
he
obtained
by
cable
to
numerous
factories
and
after
long
researches
he
had
devised
a
new
appliance
by
which
he
even
transformed
the
calorical
energy
contained
in
coal
into
electrical
energy
without
mechanical
energy
having
to
be
employed
he
had
in
this
manner
done
away
with
boilers
which
meant
a
saving
of
more
than
fifty
per
cent
in
the
cost
price
the
dynamos
being
charged
direct
by
the
simple
combustion
of
the
coal
he
had
been
able
to
work
his
electrical
furnaces
cheaply
and
well
revolutionise
metallurgy
and
provide
the
town
with
an
abundance
of
electricity
for
all
social
and
domestic
purposes
nevertheless
in
his
opinion
it
still
remained
too
costly
he
wished
to
have
it
for
nothing
like
the
passing
breeze
which
is
at
the
disposal
of
all
besides
a
fear
had
come
to
him
born
of
the
possibility
in
fact
the
certainty
that
the
coal
mines
would
in
time
become
exhausted
before
another
century
perhaps
coal
would
fail
one
and
would
not
that
mean
the
death
of
the
world
the
cessation
of
all
industry
the
suppression
of
the
chief
means
of
locomotion
mankind
reduced
to
immobility
a
prey
to
the
cold
like
some
big
body
whose
blood
has
ceased
to
circulate
it
was
with
growing
anxiety
that
jordan
saw
each
ton
of
coals
burnt
that
made
a
ton
the
less
he
often
said
and
although
he
was
so
puny
feverish
racked
by
coughing
already
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
he
incessantly
tortured
his
mind
in
thinking
of
the
catastrophe
which
threatened
the
future
generations
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
die
until
he
should
have
presented
those
generations
with
a
flood
of
power
a
flood
of
endless
life
which
would
prove
the
source
of
their
civilisation
and
their
happiness
thus
he
had
set
to
work
again
and
for
more
than
ten
years
already
he
had
been
working
on
the
problem
in
the
first
instance
jordan
had
naturally
thought
of
the
waterfalls
they
constituted
a
primitive
mechanical
force
which
had
been
employed
successfully
in
mountain
regions
in
spite
of
the
capriciousness
of
the
torrents
and
the
interruptions
which
dry
seasons
brought
about
unfortunately
the
few
watercourses
still
to
be
found
in
the
bleuse
mountains
apart
from
the
springs
utilised
for
the
did
not
possess
the
necessary
energy
and
besides
no
mountain
spring
would
ever
yield
such
a
constant
regular
and
abundant
motive
power
as
was
necessary
for
his
great
design
jordan
therefore
thought
of
the
tides
the
continual
flux
and
reflux
of
the
ocean
whose
power
ever
on
the
march
beats
against
the
coasts
of
the
continents
scientists
had
already
given
attention
to
the
tides
and
he
turned
to
their
researches
and
even
devised
some
experimental
appliances
the
distance
of
beauclair
from
the
sea
was
not
an
obstacle
for
electrical
force
could
already
be
transmitted
without
loss
over
considerable
distances
but
another
idea
haunted
him
and
gradually
took
complete
possession
of
him
throwing
him
into
a
prodigious
dream
full
of
the
thought
that
if
he
could
bring
it
to
fulfilment
he
would
give
happiness
to
the
whole
world
puny
and
chilly
as
he
was
jordan
had
always
evinced
a
passion
for
the
sun
he
often
watched
it
pursuing
its
course
with
a
quivering
fear
of
the
spreading
darkness
he
saw
it
set
at
evening
and
at
times
he
rose
early
in
the
morning
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
joy
of
seeing
it
appear
again
if
it
should
be
drowned
in
the
sea
if
it
should
some
day
never
reappear
what
endless
icy
deadly
night
would
fall
upon
mankind
thus
jordan
almost
worshipped
the
sun
regarding
it
as
something
divine
the
father
of
our
world
the
creator
and
regulator
which
after
drawing
beings
from
the
clay
had
warmed
them
helped
them
to
develop
and
spread
and
nourished
them
with
the
fruits
of
the
earth
throughout
an
incalculable
number
of
centuries
the
sun
was
the
eternal
source
of
life
since
it
was
the
source
of
light
heat
and
motion
it
reigned
in
its
glory
like
a
very
powerful
very
good
and
very
just
king
a
necessary
god
without
whom
there
would
be
nothing
and
whose
disappearance
would
bring
about
the
death
of
all
things
this
being
so
jordan
asked
himself
why
should
not
the
sun
continue
and
complete
his
work
during
thousands
of
years
it
had
stored
its
beneficent
heat
away
in
the
trees
of
which
coal
was
made
during
thousands
of
years
the
earth
had
preserved
in
its
bosom
that
immense
reserve
stock
of
heat
which
had
come
to
us
like
a
priceless
gift
at
the
hour
when
our
civilisation
needed
new
splendour
and
it
was
to
the
sun
that
one
must
again
apply
it
was
the
sun
which
would
continue
giving
to
that
which
it
had
created
the
world
and
man
increase
of
life
and
truth
and
justice
all
the
happiness
indeed
of
which
one
had
dreamt
so
long
since
the
sun
vanished
each
evening
since
it
disappeared
at
one
must
ask
it
to
leave
us
a
plentiful
share
of
its
blaze
in
order
that
one
might
without
suffering
await
its
return
at
dawn
and
take
patience
during
the
cold
seasons
the
problem
was
at
once
a
simple
and
a
formidable
one
it
was
necessary
to
address
oneself
direct
to
the
sun
capture
some
of
the
solar
heat
and
by
special
appliances
transform
it
into
electricity
of
which
immense
quantities
must
be
stored
in
reservoirs
in
this
fashion
one
would
always
have
an
unlimited
source
of
power
of
which
one
might
dispose
as
one
pleased
the
rays
would
be
harvested
during
the
scorching
days
of
summer
and
stored
away
in
endless
granaries
and
when
the
nights
grew
long
when
winter
arrived
with
its
darkness
and
its
ice
there
would
be
light
and
warmth
and
motion
for
all
mankind
that
electrical
power
ravished
from
the
sun
and
domesticated
by
man
would
then
at
last
prove
his
docile
and
servant
relieving
him
of
much
exertion
and
helping
him
to
make
of
work
not
only
gaiety
and
health
and
just
apportionment
of
wealth
but
the
very
law
and
cult
of
life
the
dream
which
possessed
jordan
had
already
occupied
other
minds
scientists
had
succeeded
in
devising
little
appliances
which
captured
solar
heat
and
transformed
it
into
electricity
but
in
infinitesimal
quantities
the
instruments
being
suited
merely
for
laboratory
experiments
it
was
necessary
to
be
able
to
operate
on
a
large
scale
and
in
a
thoroughly
practical
manner
in
order
to
fill
the
huge
reservoirs
which
would
be
needed
for
the
requirements
of
a
whole
nation
for
years
then
jordan
was
seen
superintending
the
building
in
the
old
park
of
la
crÃªcherie
of
some
strange
appliances
species
of
towers
whose
purpose
could
not
be
divined
for
a
long
while
he
would
not
speak
out
but
kept
the
secret
of
his
researches
from
everybody
in
fine
weather
during
the
hours
when
he
felt
strong
enough
he
repaired
with
the
short
slow
step
of
a
weak
old
man
to
the
new
works
which
he
had
set
up
and
shut
himself
up
inside
them
with
some
chosen
men
and
in
spite
of
repeated
failures
he
clung
to
his
task
wrestled
with
it
and
ended
by
overcoming
the
sovereign
planet
he
the
little
ant
whom
too
hot
a
sunray
would
have
killed
never
was
there
greater
heroism
never
did
the
pursuit
of
an
idea
afford
the
spectacle
of
a
loftier
victory
over
the
natural
forces
forces
which
yesterday
had
been
deadly
thunderbolts
for
man
and
which
were
conquered
subjected
to
his
service
he
succeeded
in
solving
the
problem
the
great
and
glorious
sun
parted
with
some
little
of
that
inexhaustible
glow
with
which
never
cooling
it
has
warmed
the
earth
through
so
many
centuries
after
some
final
trials
new
works
were
definitively
planned
and
erected
and
supplied
beauclair
throughout
a
whole
year
with
as
much
electricity
as
its
inhabitants
required
even
as
the
springs
of
the
mountains
supplied
them
with
water
nevertheless
an
annoying
defect
was
observed
the
loss
from
the
reservoirs
remained
very
large
and
some
last
improvements
had
to
be
devised
a
means
of
storing
without
fear
of
diminution
the
necessary
winter
reserve
of
power
in
such
wise
that
another
sun
as
it
were
might
be
lighted
above
the
town
throughout
the
long
cold
nights
of
december
again
did
jordan
set
to
work
he
sought
he
struggled
still
resolved
upon
keeping
alive
until
his
task
should
be
completed
his
strength
declined
he
was
at
last
unable
to
go
out
and
had
to
rest
content
with
sending
his
orders
to
the
works
respecting
the
final
ameliorations
in
this
fashion
several
months
went
by
shut
up
in
his
laboratory
he
there
perfected
his
work
resolved
to
die
there
on
the
day
when
this
work
should
be
ended
and
that
day
arrived
he
found
a
means
of
preventing
all
loss
of
rendering
his
reservoirs
absolutely
impermeable
capable
of
holding
their
store
of
electric
force
for
a
long
period
and
then
he
had
but
one
desire
to
bid
farewell
to
his
work
embrace
his
friends
and
return
again
into
universal
life
the
month
of
october
had
come
and
the
sun
was
still
gilding
the
last
leaves
with
warm
clear
gold
jordan
requested
sÅurette
to
have
him
carried
in
an
for
the
last
time
to
the
works
where
the
new
reservoirs
had
been
installed
he
wished
to
gaze
upon
his
creation
to
make
sure
that
enough
sunshine
was
stored
away
to
enable
beauclair
to
wait
for
the
return
of
spring
and
so
one
delightful
afternoon
he
was
taken
to
the
works
and
spent
two
hours
in
them
inspecting
everything
and
regulating
the
action
of
the
appliances
the
works
were
built
at
the
very
foot
of
the
bleuse
mountains
in
a
part
of
the
old
park
which
looked
towards
the
south
and
which
had
formerly
been
an
overflowing
paradise
of
fruit
and
flowers
there
were
towers
rising
above
large
buildings
with
long
roofs
of
steel
and
glass
but
nothing
connected
with
the
work
could
be
seen
from
the
outside
for
all
the
conducting
cables
passed
underground
at
last
by
way
of
finishing
his
visit
jordan
bade
his
bearers
halt
for
a
moment
in
the
central
courtyard
where
he
gave
a
long
supreme
glance
around
him
at
that
nucleus
of
a
new
world
endowed
with
the
source
of
eternal
life
his
creation
the
passion
of
his
whole
life
and
finally
he
turned
towards
sÅurette
who
never
quitting
him
had
followed
his
step
by
step
said
he
with
a
smile
finished
and
it
seems
quite
satisfactory
so
now
i
can
go
off
let
us
return
to
the
house
sister
he
was
very
gay
radiant
like
a
toiler
who
thinks
that
he
will
at
last
be
able
to
rest
since
his
work
is
done
however
his
sister
hoping
that
he
might
benefit
by
the
sunshine
told
the
men
carrying
the
not
to
hurry
but
to
go
back
to
the
house
by
a
somewhat
roundabout
way
and
thus
it
happened
that
on
emerging
from
one
of
the
paths
jordan
suddenly
found
himself
in
front
of
the
pavilion
where
luc
still
dwelt
reduced
like
his
friend
to
immobility
since
he
had
lost
the
use
of
his
legs
for
some
months
now
the
two
friends
had
not
seen
one
another
they
could
only
correspond
obtain
news
of
each
other
through
their
dear
nurses
their
guardian
angels
who
were
ever
coming
and
going
between
them
and
a
final
desire
the
last
desire
of
his
heart
suddenly
upbuoyed
the
sinking
jordan
sister
i
beg
you
said
he
them
stop
and
place
my
chair
yonder
under
that
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
tall
grass
and
go
up
to
luc
at
once
and
tell
him
that
i
am
here
at
his
door
waiting
for
him
sÅurette
hesitated
for
a
moment
feeling
somewhat
anxious
at
the
thought
of
all
the
emotion
which
such
an
interview
would
bring
with
it
luc
is
like
yourself
my
friend
she
said
can
not
stir
how
would
you
have
him
come
downstairs
the
gay
smile
which
revived
the
brilliancy
of
jordan
eyes
again
appeared
upon
his
face
bearers
will
carry
him
down
sister
he
replied
i
have
come
so
far
in
my
he
can
surely
come
here
in
his
and
he
added
tenderly
is
so
pleasant
here
we
can
have
a
last
chat
together
and
bid
one
another
goodbye
how
can
we
part
for
ever
without
embracing
it
was
impossible
for
sÅurette
to
refuse
his
request
any
longer
so
she
went
into
the
pavilion
for
luc
jordan
waited
quietly
amidst
the
caress
of
the
declining
sun
and
his
sister
soon
returned
announcing
that
his
friend
was
coming
deep
was
the
emotion
when
luc
appeared
likewise
carried
by
the
men
in
his
he
was
brought
towards
the
greenery
followed
by
josine
and
suzanne
who
did
not
leave
him
at
last
the
bearers
deposited
him
near
jordan
the
chairs
touching
one
another
and
the
two
friends
were
then
able
to
press
each
other
hands
my
good
jordan
how
much
i
thank
you
said
luc
kind
of
you
to
have
thought
of
bringing
us
together
in
order
that
we
might
see
one
another
again
and
bid
one
another
a
last
would
have
done
the
same
my
dear
luc
jordan
answered
i
was
passing
and
you
were
there
it
was
natural
that
we
should
meet
for
the
last
time
on
this
grass
under
one
of
our
dear
trees
whose
shade
we
have
loved
so
well
the
tree
under
which
they
sat
was
a
big
silvery
a
superb
giant
that
had
already
shed
its
leaves
but
the
sunshine
still
gilded
it
delightfully
and
the
golden
dust
of
the
planet
fell
in
a
warm
rain
athwart
its
branches
the
evening
too
was
exquisite
an
evening
of
intense
peacefulness
fraught
with
the
sweetest
charm
a
broad
sun
ray
enveloped
the
two
old
men
as
with
a
loving
splendour
whilst
the
three
women
standing
in
the
rear
watched
over
them
with
solicitude
think
of
it
my
friend
jordan
resumed
so
many
years
past
whilst
we
have
been
pursuing
parallel
tasks
our
lives
have
been
mingled
i
should
have
gone
off
full
of
remorse
if
i
had
not
again
excused
myself
for
having
placed
such
little
faith
in
your
work
when
you
first
came
to
me
and
asked
my
help
to
build
the
future
city
of
justice
i
was
at
that
time
convinced
that
you
would
encounter
defeat
luc
began
to
laugh
yes
as
you
said
my
friend
political
economical
and
social
struggles
were
not
your
business
no
doubt
there
has
been
much
futile
agitation
among
men
but
was
one
to
abstain
on
that
account
from
taking
part
in
what
went
on
was
one
to
allow
evolution
to
take
place
as
it
listed
and
refrain
from
hastening
the
hour
of
deliverance
all
the
compromises
often
necessary
ones
all
the
base
devices
to
which
the
leaders
of
men
have
stooped
have
had
their
excuse
in
the
double
march
which
they
have
at
times
helped
mankind
to
effect
jordan
hastily
interrupted
him
were
right
my
friend
said
he
you
have
proved
it
magnificently
your
battle
here
has
created
hastened
the
advent
of
a
new
world
perhaps
you
have
snatched
a
hundred
years
from
human
wretchedness
at
all
events
this
new
town
of
beauclair
where
more
justice
and
happiness
now
flower
proclaims
the
excellence
of
your
mission
the
beneficent
glory
of
your
achievement
i
am
with
you
entirely
you
see
in
mind
and
in
heart
and
i
do
not
wish
to
quit
you
without
telling
you
once
more
how
thoroughly
you
won
me
over
to
your
work
and
with
what
growing
affection
i
watched
you
whilst
you
were
realising
so
many
great
things
you
were
often
an
example
for
me
but
luc
protested
do
not
let
us
speak
of
any
example
of
mine
my
friend
it
was
you
who
ever
gave
me
one
the
loftiest
the
most
magnificent
remember
my
lassitude
my
occasional
attacks
of
weakness
whereas
i
always
found
you
erect
endowed
with
more
courage
more
and
more
faith
in
your
work
even
on
the
days
when
everything
seemed
to
be
crumbling
around
you
that
which
made
you
invincible
was
that
you
believed
solely
in
work
in
which
alone
you
set
health
and
the
one
reason
for
living
and
doing
and
your
own
work
became
your
very
heart
and
brain
the
blood
pulsing
in
your
veins
the
thought
ever
on
the
alert
in
the
depths
of
your
mind
your
work
alone
existed
for
you
building
itself
up
with
all
the
life
that
you
bestowed
on
it
hour
by
hour
and
what
an
imperishable
monument
what
a
gift
of
splendour
and
happiness
you
will
leave
to
mankind
i
might
never
have
been
able
to
carry
out
my
own
work
as
a
builder
of
towns
and
leader
of
men
and
at
all
events
it
would
as
yet
be
as
nothing
had
it
not
been
for
yours
silence
fell
and
some
birds
flew
by
whilst
through
the
bare
branches
of
the
the
autumn
sunshine
streamed
more
gently
as
evening
advanced
sÅurette
in
her
motherly
fashion
became
anxious
and
drew
jordan
rug
over
his
knees
whilst
josine
and
suzanne
bent
over
luc
fearing
lest
he
should
tire
himself
but
the
latter
replied
to
jordan
remains
the
great
revolutionary
you
told
me
so
at
the
outset
and
every
forward
step
in
our
long
lives
has
shown
me
how
right
you
were
would
our
town
of
beauclair
now
all
comfort
and
solidarity
have
been
possible
as
yet
if
you
had
not
placed
at
its
disposal
that
electrical
power
which
has
become
the
necessary
agent
of
all
work
all
social
life
science
truth
will
alone
emancipate
man
make
him
master
of
his
destiny
and
give
him
sovereignty
over
the
world
by
reducing
the
natural
forces
to
the
status
of
obedient
servants
whilst
i
was
building
my
friend
you
gave
me
what
was
needed
to
infuse
life
into
my
stones
and
mortar
is
true
no
doubt
that
science
will
free
man
jordan
quietly
replied
in
his
weak
little
voice
at
bottom
truth
is
the
one
powerful
artisan
of
fraternity
and
justice
and
i
going
off
feeling
well
pleased
with
myself
for
i
just
paid
my
last
visit
to
our
factory
and
it
is
working
now
as
i
desired
it
to
work
for
the
relief
and
felicity
of
all
he
went
on
giving
explanations
and
instructions
respecting
the
working
of
the
new
appliances
the
employment
of
those
reservoirs
of
force
as
if
indeed
he
were
dictating
his
last
will
and
testament
to
his
friend
electricity
already
cost
nothing
and
was
so
abundant
that
it
might
be
given
to
the
inhabitants
of
beauclair
in
whatever
measure
they
desired
like
the
streams
whose
flood
was
inexhaustible
like
the
air
which
came
freely
from
the
four
corners
of
the
heavens
and
given
in
this
wise
electricity
was
life
in
every
public
edifice
and
private
house
even
the
most
modest
light
heat
and
motive
power
were
distributed
without
counting
it
was
only
necessary
to
turn
on
a
few
switches
and
the
house
was
illumined
and
warmed
food
was
cooked
and
various
trade
and
household
appliances
were
set
working
all
sorts
of
ingenious
little
mechanisms
were
being
invented
for
household
requirements
relieving
women
of
the
work
which
they
had
formerly
done
substituting
mechanical
action
for
manual
toil
in
a
word
from
the
housewife
to
the
the
ancient
human
beast
of
burden
had
been
altogether
relieved
of
physical
exertion
and
useless
suffering
a
subjugated
and
domesticated
natural
force
now
replacing
the
toilers
and
performing
all
the
work
allotted
to
it
in
silence
and
cleanliness
with
merely
an
attendant
to
check
its
action
and
this
also
meant
relief
and
freedom
for
the
mind
a
moral
and
intellectual
rise
for
every
brain
hitherto
weighed
down
by
excessive
work
badly
apportioned
and
fraught
with
savage
iniquity
for
the
greater
number
of
the
disinherited
whom
it
had
plunged
in
ignorance
baseness
and
crime
and
it
was
not
slothful
idleness
that
now
reigned
in
the
place
of
excessive
toil
but
work
into
which
more
freedom
and
conscience
entered
man
really
becoming
the
king
of
work
devoting
himself
to
the
occupations
he
preferred
and
creating
more
truth
and
beauty
according
to
his
tastes
after
the
few
hours
of
general
work
which
he
gave
to
the
community
and
meantime
also
the
unhappy
domestic
animals
the
horses
all
the
beasts
used
for
draught
burden
and
servitude
were
freed
from
the
carts
they
had
been
compelled
to
drag
the
millstones
they
had
turned
the
loads
they
had
carried
and
were
restored
to
happy
life
in
the
fields
and
the
woods
but
the
purposes
for
which
the
electric
force
could
be
used
were
innumerable
and
each
day
brought
with
it
some
fresh
benefit
jordan
had
invented
some
lamps
of
such
great
power
that
two
or
three
sufficed
to
illumine
an
avenue
thus
the
dream
of
lighting
another
sun
above
beauclair
at
would
assuredly
be
fulfilled
some
huge
and
splendid
glass
houses
had
also
been
erected
in
which
by
means
of
an
improved
system
of
heating
flowers
vegetables
and
fruits
could
be
easily
grown
at
all
seasons
the
town
was
full
of
them
they
were
distributed
broadcast
and
winter
like
night
ceased
to
exist
moreover
transport
and
locomotion
were
facilitated
more
and
more
thanks
to
the
free
motive
power
which
was
applied
to
an
infinity
of
vehicles
bicycles
carriages
carts
and
trains
of
several
coaches
i
am
going
off
feeling
well
pleased
jordan
repeated
with
serene
gaiety
done
my
own
work
and
the
general
task
is
sufficiently
well
advanced
to
allow
me
to
fall
asleep
in
all
peacefulness
the
secret
of
aerial
navigation
will
be
discovered
and
man
will
conquer
the
atmosphere
even
as
he
conquered
the
oceans
he
will
be
able
to
correspond
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
earth
without
wire
or
cable
human
speech
human
gesture
will
dart
round
the
world
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
and
that
indeed
my
friend
is
the
deliverance
of
the
nations
by
science
the
great
invincible
revolutionary
who
will
ever
bring
them
increase
of
peace
and
truth
you
yourself
long
ago
obliterated
the
frontiers
so
to
say
by
your
rails
your
railway
lines
which
have
extended
further
and
further
crossing
rivers
transpiercing
mountains
gathering
the
nations
together
in
a
closer
and
closer
network
of
intercourse
and
what
will
it
be
when
one
capital
can
chat
in
friendly
fashion
with
another
however
far
away
when
the
same
thought
at
the
same
minute
occupies
the
attention
of
distant
continents
and
when
the
balloon
cars
travel
freely
through
the
infinite
man
common
patrimony
without
knowing
aught
of
customs
tariffs
the
air
which
we
all
breathe
that
space
which
is
the
property
of
all
will
prove
a
field
of
harmony
in
which
the
men
of
will
assuredly
become
reconciled
and
this
is
why
you
have
always
seen
me
so
composed
my
friend
so
convinced
of
final
deliverance
men
might
do
all
they
could
to
devour
one
another
religions
might
pile
error
upon
error
in
order
to
retain
their
domination
but
science
was
taking
a
step
forward
every
day
creating
more
light
more
brotherliness
more
happiness
and
by
the
irresistible
force
of
truth
it
will
at
last
sweep
away
all
the
dark
and
hateful
past
liberate
the
minds
of
men
and
draw
their
hearts
closer
and
closer
together
under
the
great
and
beneficent
sun
the
father
of
us
all
jordan
was
growing
tired
and
his
voice
became
very
faint
nevertheless
he
laughed
again
as
he
concluded
see
my
friend
i
was
as
much
of
a
revolutionist
as
you
know
it
luc
replied
with
affectionate
gentleness
have
been
my
master
in
all
things
i
shall
never
be
able
to
thank
you
sufficiently
for
the
admirable
lesson
of
energy
you
gave
me
by
your
superb
faith
in
work
the
sun
was
now
fast
declining
and
a
light
quiver
had
passed
between
the
branches
of
the
great
whence
fell
the
planet
golden
dust
now
of
a
paler
hue
night
approached
and
a
delightful
stillness
spread
slowly
over
the
tall
herbage
the
three
women
still
standing
there
silent
and
attentive
full
of
respect
for
that
supreme
interview
nevertheless
became
anxious
and
gently
intervened
however
as
josine
and
sÅurette
covered
luc
in
his
turn
with
a
rug
he
said
to
them
do
feel
cold
the
evening
is
so
beautiful
but
sÅurette
turned
to
glance
at
the
sun
which
was
about
to
disappear
from
the
horizon
and
jordan
following
her
glance
exclaimed
night
is
falling
but
the
sun
may
go
to
bed
now
it
has
left
some
of
its
beneficence
and
power
in
our
granaries
if
it
now
sets
the
meaning
is
that
my
day
is
over
i
am
going
to
sleep
my
friend
my
friend
luc
rejoined
shall
soon
go
to
sleep
also
this
was
their
farewell
full
of
poignant
affection
simple
yet
wondrous
grandeur
they
knew
that
they
would
never
more
see
one
another
and
they
exchanged
a
last
glance
and
spoke
a
few
last
words
my
friend
jordan
repeated
not
be
sad
death
is
good
and
necessary
one
lives
again
in
others
one
remains
immortal
we
have
already
given
ourselves
to
others
we
have
worked
for
them
only
and
we
shall
be
born
again
in
them
and
thus
enjoy
our
share
of
our
work
goodbye
my
friend
then
luc
once
again
repeated
my
friend
all
that
will
remain
of
us
will
tell
how
much
we
loved
and
hoped
each
is
born
for
his
task
that
is
the
sole
reason
of
life
nature
brings
a
fresh
being
into
the
world
each
time
that
she
needs
another
workman
and
when
his
day
work
is
over
the
workman
can
lie
down
the
earth
will
take
him
again
for
other
uses
my
friend
he
leant
forward
for
he
wished
to
embrace
jordan
but
he
was
unable
to
do
so
until
the
three
affectionate
women
came
to
the
help
of
both
of
them
sustaining
them
whilst
they
exchanged
that
last
embrace
they
laughed
at
it
like
children
they
were
full
of
gaiety
and
serenity
at
that
moment
of
separation
feeling
neither
regret
nor
remorse
since
they
had
done
all
their
duty
all
their
work
as
men
and
they
had
no
fears
no
terror
of
the
morrow
of
death
certain
as
they
were
of
the
deep
quietude
in
which
good
workmen
slumber
they
exchanged
a
long
and
very
tender
embrace
putting
all
the
strength
that
remained
to
them
into
that
last
kiss
my
dear
jordan
my
dear
luc
then
they
spoke
no
more
the
silence
became
intense
and
holy
the
sun
disappeared
from
the
great
heavens
vanishing
behind
the
vague
and
distant
horizon
a
bird
perched
on
the
ceased
singing
and
delicate
shadows
stole
over
the
branches
whilst
the
lofty
herbage
and
all
the
park
with
its
clumps
of
trees
its
paths
and
its
lawns
sank
into
the
delightful
quietude
of
twilight
then
at
a
sign
from
sÅurette
the
bearers
took
up
jordan
chair
and
slowly
gently
carried
him
away
luc
had
asked
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
remain
under
the
tree
a
little
longer
and
as
he
still
sat
there
he
watched
his
friend
going
off
along
a
broad
straight
pathway
at
one
moment
jordan
looked
round
and
a
last
glance
and
a
laugh
were
exchanged
then
all
was
over
luc
saw
the
disappear
whilst
the
park
was
invaded
by
the
gathering
gloom
and
jordan
on
returning
to
his
laboratory
went
to
bed
there
and
even
as
he
had
said
to
luc
his
work
being
done
his
day
being
ended
he
let
death
take
him
dying
on
the
morrow
very
peacefully
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
in
sÅurette
loving
arms
luc
was
destined
to
live
five
years
longer
in
that
of
his
which
he
seldom
quitted
and
which
was
placed
near
a
window
of
his
room
whence
he
could
see
his
city
spreading
and
growing
day
by
day
a
week
after
jordan
death
sÅurette
came
to
join
josine
and
suzanne
and
from
that
day
forward
all
three
women
encompassed
luc
with
their
loving
attentions
during
the
long
hours
which
he
spent
gazing
upon
his
happy
city
he
often
lived
through
the
past
again
he
once
more
saw
his
point
of
departure
the
distant
night
of
insomnia
when
he
had
taken
up
a
little
book
in
which
the
doctrines
of
fourier
were
set
forth
and
fourier
ideas
of
genius
the
honouring
the
utilisation
the
acceptance
of
the
human
passions
as
the
very
forces
of
life
the
extrication
of
work
from
its
prison
its
ennoblement
its
transformation
into
something
attractive
into
a
new
social
code
liberty
and
justice
being
gradually
won
by
pacific
means
thanks
to
a
confederation
of
capital
work
and
brain
power
all
those
ideas
of
genius
had
suddenly
illumined
luc
mind
and
prompted
him
to
action
on
the
very
morrow
it
was
to
fourier
that
he
was
indebted
if
he
had
dared
to
make
that
experiment
at
la
crÃªcherie
the
first
with
its
school
the
first
bright
clean
workshops
the
first
with
their
white
walls
smiling
amidst
the
greenery
had
all
sprung
from
fourierist
ideas
ideas
which
had
been
left
slumbering
like
good
grain
in
winter
fields
ever
ready
to
germinate
and
flower
even
like
catholicism
the
religion
of
humanity
might
need
centuries
to
be
firmly
established
but
what
an
evolution
afterwards
what
a
continuous
broadening
of
principles
as
love
grew
and
the
city
spread
by
proposing
combination
between
capital
work
and
brain
power
as
an
immediate
experiment
fourier
the
evolutionist
a
man
of
method
and
practicability
virtually
led
one
first
to
the
social
organisation
of
the
collectivists
and
afterwards
even
to
the
libertarian
dream
of
the
anarchists
in
that
association
capital
gradually
became
annihilated
and
work
and
intelligence
became
the
only
regulators
and
basis
of
the
new
social
compact
at
the
end
lay
the
disappearance
of
ordinary
trade
and
the
suppression
of
money
the
first
a
cumbersome
cogwheel
levying
toll
and
consuming
energy
the
second
a
fictitious
value
which
became
useless
in
a
community
in
which
all
contributed
to
produce
prodigious
wealth
that
circulated
in
continual
exchanges
and
thus
starting
with
fourier
experiment
the
new
city
was
fated
to
transform
itself
at
each
fresh
advance
marching
on
to
more
and
more
liberty
and
equity
and
conquering
on
its
way
all
the
socialists
of
the
various
hostile
sects
the
collectivists
and
even
the
anarchists
and
finally
grouping
them
in
a
brotherly
people
reconciled
amidst
the
fulfilment
of
their
common
ideal
the
kingdom
of
heaven
set
at
last
upon
the
earth
and
that
was
the
admirable
spectacle
which
luc
ever
had
before
his
eyes
a
spectacle
summed
up
in
that
city
of
happiness
whose
bright
roofs
spread
out
among
the
trees
before
his
window
the
march
which
the
first
generation
imbued
with
all
the
ancient
errors
spoilt
by
iniquitous
surroundings
had
begun
so
painfully
amidst
so
many
obstacles
and
so
much
hatred
was
pursued
with
a
joyous
easy
step
by
the
ensuing
generations
which
the
new
schools
and
workshops
had
created
they
were
attaining
to
heights
which
had
once
been
declared
inaccessible
thanks
to
continuous
change
the
children
and
the
children
children
seemed
to
have
hearts
and
brains
different
from
those
of
their
forerunners
and
brotherliness
became
easy
to
them
in
a
community
in
which
the
happiness
of
each
was
virtually
compounded
of
the
happiness
of
all
with
trade
theft
had
disappeared
with
money
all
criminal
cupidity
had
vanished
inheritance
no
longer
existed
and
so
no
more
privileged
idlers
were
born
and
men
no
longer
butchered
each
other
to
benefit
by
somebody
will
what
was
the
use
of
hating
one
another
of
being
envious
of
one
another
of
seeking
to
acquire
somebody
property
by
ruse
or
force
when
the
public
fortune
belonged
to
one
and
all
each
being
born
living
and
dying
in
as
good
circumstances
as
his
neighbour
crime
became
senseless
idiotic
and
the
whole
savage
apparatus
of
repression
and
chastisement
instituted
to
protect
the
thefts
of
a
few
rich
beings
from
the
rebellion
of
the
wretched
multitude
had
fallen
to
pieces
like
something
useless
gendarmes
and
law
courts
and
prisons
alike
being
swept
away
living
among
that
people
who
knew
not
the
horrors
of
war
who
obeyed
the
one
law
of
work
with
a
solidarity
simply
based
upon
reason
and
individual
interest
properly
understood
a
people
too
saved
from
the
monstrous
falsehoods
of
religion
well
informed
knowing
the
truth
and
bent
on
justice
one
realised
how
possible
became
the
alleged
of
universal
happiness
since
the
passions
instead
of
being
combated
and
stifled
had
been
cultivated
like
the
very
forces
of
life
they
had
lost
all
criminal
bitterness
and
had
become
social
virtues
a
continuous
flowering
of
individual
energies
legitimate
happiness
lay
in
the
development
and
education
of
the
five
senses
and
the
sense
of
love
the
long
efforts
of
mankind
ended
in
the
free
expansion
of
the
individual
and
in
a
social
system
satisfying
every
need
man
being
man
in
his
entirety
and
living
life
in
its
entirety
also
and
the
happy
city
had
thus
secured
realisation
in
the
practice
of
the
religion
of
life
the
religion
of
humanity
freed
from
dogmas
finding
in
itself
its
its
end
its
joy
and
its
glory
but
luc
particularly
beheld
the
triumph
of
work
the
saviour
creator
regulator
of
the
world
he
had
at
the
very
outset
desired
to
destroy
the
iniquitous
and
had
dreamt
of
a
new
compact
which
would
allow
of
a
just
apportionment
of
wealth
but
what
a
deal
of
ground
it
had
been
necessary
to
traverse
in
this
respect
again
the
evolution
had
started
from
fourier
for
to
him
could
be
traced
the
association
of
workers
the
varied
attractive
limited
labour
of
the
workshops
the
groups
of
workers
forming
successive
series
parting
to
meet
again
and
mingling
with
all
the
constant
play
of
free
organs
the
play
of
life
itself
the
germs
of
the
libertarian
commune
may
be
found
in
fourier
for
if
he
repudiated
brutal
revolution
and
began
by
making
use
of
the
existing
mechanism
of
society
his
doctrines
tended
in
their
result
to
that
society
destruction
no
doubt
the
had
long
lingered
at
the
works
of
la
crÃªcherie
passing
through
various
stages
of
association
division
of
profits
a
percentage
of
interest
in
the
common
toil
at
last
it
had
been
transformed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
satisfy
the
collectivists
realising
their
formula
a
regulated
circulation
of
for
work
nevertheless
it
still
remained
the
attenuated
disguised
but
refusing
to
die
and
the
doctrine
of
the
libertarian
commune
alone
had
swept
it
away
in
the
course
of
a
last
advance
that
of
deliverance
by
liberty
and
justice
in
their
entirety
that
chimera
of
other
days
that
unity
and
harmony
which
now
really
lived
at
present
no
authority
remained
the
new
social
compact
was
based
solely
on
the
bond
of
necessary
work
accepted
by
all
and
constituting
both
law
and
cult
an
infinity
of
groups
practised
it
starting
with
the
old
groups
of
the
building
clothing
and
metal
trades
the
industrial
workers
and
the
tillers
of
the
soil
but
multiplying
and
varying
incessantly
in
such
wise
as
to
be
adapted
to
all
individual
desires
as
well
as
to
all
the
needs
of
the
community
nothing
hindered
individual
expansion
each
citizen
formed
part
of
as
many
groups
as
he
desired
passed
from
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
to
factory
work
gave
his
time
as
best
suited
his
faculties
and
his
desires
and
there
was
no
longer
any
contention
between
classes
since
only
one
class
existed
a
whole
nation
of
workers
equally
rich
equally
happy
educated
to
the
same
level
with
no
difference
either
in
attire
or
in
or
in
manners
and
customs
work
was
king
the
only
guide
only
master
and
only
deity
instinct
with
sovereign
nobility
since
it
had
redeemed
mankind
when
it
was
dying
of
falsehood
and
injustice
and
had
restored
it
to
vigour
and
to
the
joy
of
life
and
to
love
and
to
beauty
luc
laughed
gaily
when
the
morning
breeze
wafted
towards
him
all
the
sonorous
gaiety
of
his
city
how
good
easy
and
delightful
was
the
work
performed
there
it
lasted
only
a
few
hours
each
day
and
so
much
of
it
the
most
delicate
as
well
as
the
mightiest
task
was
performed
by
the
new
machinery
which
completed
man
conquest
of
nature
and
loaded
him
with
wealth
and
abundance
freed
from
long
hours
of
rough
toil
man
was
the
better
able
to
exert
his
mind
art
and
science
soared
the
level
of
current
mentality
was
ever
rising
great
intelligence
ceased
to
be
an
exception
and
men
of
genius
sprang
up
in
crowds
the
science
of
alimentation
had
already
been
revolutionised
by
chemistry
the
earth
might
have
yielded
no
more
wheat
no
more
olives
no
more
grapes
and
yet
enough
bread
oil
and
wine
for
the
whole
city

have
come
from
its
laboratories
in
physics
in
electricity
especially
fresh
inventions
were
ever
and
ever
enlarging
the
domain
of
the
possible
and
endowing
men
with
the
power
of
gods
knowing
all
seeing
all
and
capable
of
all
then
came
the
flight
of
art
the
growth
and
diffusion
of
beauty
in
every
respect
an
extraordinary
florescence
of
all
the
arts
now
that
the
soul
of
the
multitude
throbbed
in
every
soul
and
that
life
was
lived
with
all
its
passions
freed
love
given
and
received
in
its
entirety
inspired
by
the
universal
loving
kindness
music
became
the
very
voice
of
the
happy
people
through
and
for
whom
musicians
found
the
most
sublime
chants
in
whose
continual
harmony
theatres
workshops
dwellings
and
streets
were
ever
steeped
and
for
the
people
architects
built
vast
and
superb
palaces
made
in
its
own
image
of
a
size
and
a
majesty
at
once
varied
and
yet
all
one
like
the
multitude
itself
all
the
charming
variations
of
thousands
of
individualities
finding
expression
in
them
then
sculptors
peopled
the
gardens
and
museums
with
living
bronze
and
marble
and
painters
decorated
the
public
edifices
the
railway
stations
the
markets
the
libraries
the
theatres
and
the
halls
for
study
and
diversion
with
scenes
borrowed
from
daily

to
that
innumerable
people
who
all

powerful
works
born
of
them

them
genius
expanded
acquiring
fresh
strength
from
increase
of
knowledge
and
freedom
among
the
community
never
before
had
it
displayed
such
splendour
the
narrow
cramped
aristocratic
literature
of
the
past
had
been
swept
away
by
the
literature
of
humanity
poems
overflowing
with
life
which
all
had
helped
to
create
with
their
blood
and
which
returned
to
the
hearts
of
all
full
of
serenity
without
fear
for
the
future
luc
watched
his
town
growing
like
a
beautiful
being
endowed
with
eternal
youth
it
had
descended
from
the
brias
gorges
between
the
two
promontories
of
the
bleuse
mountains
and
was
now
spread
over
the
of
la
roumagne
in
fine
weather
its
white
smiled
amidst
the
verdure
without
a
single
puff
of
smoke
besmirching
the
pure
atmosphere
for
there
were
no
chimneys
left
electricity
having
everywhere
replaced
coal
and
wood
for
heating
purposes
the
light
silk
canopy
of
the
broad
blue
sky
spread
over
all
immaculate
without
a
speck
of
soot
thus
in
aspect
the
town
remained
a
new
one
bright
and
gay
under
the
refreshing
breezes
whilst
on
all
sides
one
heard
the
carolling
of
water
the
crystalline
streaming
of
springs
whose
purity
brought
health
and
perpetual
delight
the
population
steadily
increased
fresh
houses
were
built
fresh
gardens
were
planted
a
happy
people
free
and
brotherly
becomes
a
centre
of
attraction
and
thus
the
little
towns
of
the
neighbourhood
formerie
and
magnolles
had
found
it
necessary
to
follow
the
example
of
beauclair
and
had
ended
by
becoming
so
many
prolongations
of
the
original
city
it
had
been
sufficient
to
make
an
experiment
on
a
small
scale
and
by
degrees
the
the
department
the
whole
region
was
won
over
irresistible
happiness
was
on
the
march
and
nothing
will
be
able
to
withstand
the
force
of
happiness
when
men
possess
a
clear
and
decisive
perception
of
it
mankind
has
known
but
one
struggle
through
the
ages
the
struggle
for
happiness
which
is
to
be
found
beneath
every
form
of
religion
every
form
of
government
egotism
is
merely
an
individual
effort
to
acquire
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
happiness
for
self
and
why
should
not
each
set
his
egotism
in
treating
his
fellows
as
brothers
when
he
becomes
convinced
that
the
happiness
of
each
rests
in
the
happiness
of
all
if
there
was
contention
between
different
interests
in
the
past
it
was
because
the
old
social
pact
opposed
them
one
to
the
other
making
warfare
the
very
soul
of
society
but
let
it
be
demonstrated
that
work
reorganised
will
apportion
wealth
justly
and
that
the
passions
playing
freely
will
lead
to
harmony
and
unity
and
then
peace
will
at
once
ensue
and
happiness
will
be
established
in
a
brotherly
contract
of
solidarity
why
should
one
fight
one
against
the
other
when
interests
cease
to
clash
if
all
the
desperate
exertions
of
generations
the
prodigious
sum
of
efforts
blood
and
tears
that
mankind
has
given
to
mutual
slaughter
throughout
so
many
centuries
had
only
been
devoted
to
the
conquest
of
the
world
the
subjugation
of
the
natural
forces
man
would
long
since
have
been
the
absolute
happy
sovereign
of
creatures
and
things
when
humanity
at
last
became
conscious
of
its
imbecile
dementia
when
man
ceased
to
be
wolfishly
inclined
towards
his
brother
and
resolved
to
devote
some
of
the
genius
and
wealth
hitherto
squandered
in
mutual
annihilation
to
the
common
work
of
happiness
the
mastery
of
the
elements
on
that
day
the
nations
first
started
on
their
march
towards
the
happy
city
and
no
it
is
not
true
that
a
nation
having
its
every
need
satisfied
having
to
battle
no
longer
for
existence
would
thereby
gradually
lose
the
strength
it
requires
to
live
and
sink
into
torpor
and
catalepsy
the
human
dream
will
always
be
without
a
limit
there
will
always
remain
much
of
the
unknown
to
be
conquered
each
time
a
new
craving
is
contented
desire
will
give
birth
to
another
the
satisfaction
of
which
will
exalt
men
and
make
them
heroes
of
science
and
beauty
desire
is
infinite
and
if
men
long
battled
together
in
order
to
steal
happiness
one
from
the
other
they
will
battle
side
by
side
to
increase
it
to
make
it
an
immense
banquet
resplendent
with
joy
and
glory
vast
enough
to
satiate
the
passions
of
thousands
of
millions
of
human
creatures
and
there
will
be
only
heroes
left
and
each
fresh
child
born
into
the
world
will
receive
as
his
birthgift
the
whole
earth
the
unbounded
expanse
of
heaven
and
the
paternal
sun
the
source
of
immortal
life
as
luc
gaily
contemplated
his
triumphant
town
he
often
repeated
that
love
alone
had
created
all
the
prodigies
he
beheld
he
had
sown
the
seed
and
now
he
reaped
inexhaustible
harvests
of
kindliness
and
brotherliness
at
the
very
outset
he
had
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
found
his
city
by
and
for
woman
if
it
was
to
prove
fruitful
and
for
ever
desirable
and
beautiful
woman
saved
josine
set
in
her
due
place
of
beauty
dignity
and
tenderness
was
not
that
the
symbol
of
the
future
alliance
the
union
of
the
sexes
ensuring
social
peace
and
free
and
just
life
in
common
then
too
the
new
system
of
education
the
sexes
being
reared
together
and
acquiring
the
same
knowledge
had
brought
them
to
a
complete
understanding
and
made
them
sincerely
desirous
of
attaining
to
the
one
object
of
life
that
object
which
was
reached
by
loving
a
great
deal
in
order
that
one
might
be
loved
a
great
deal
in
return
true
wisdom
lay
in
creating
happiness
it
was
thus
that
one
logically
became
happy
oneself
and
now
love
chose
freely
no
law
mutual
consent
alone
regulated
marriage
a
young
man
a
young
girl
had
known
one
another
since
their
schooldays
had
passed
through
the
same
workshops
together
and
when
they
bestowed
themselves
one
on
the
other
that
bestowal
was
simply
like
the
florescence
of
their
long
intimacy
they
gave
themselves
to
one
another
for
life
long
and
faithful
unions
predominating
they
grew
old
together
even
as
they
had
grown
up
together
in
a
bestowal
of
their
whole
beings
their
rights
being
equal
their
love
equal
also
yet
their
liberty
remained
entire
separation
was
always
possible
for
those
who
ceased
to
agree
and
their
offspring
remained
with
one
or
the
other
as
they
decided
or
when
difficulties
supervened
in
the
charge
of
the
community
the
bitter
duel
of
man
and
woman
all
the
questions
which
had
so
long
set
the
sexes
one
against
the
other
like
savage
irreconcilable
enemies
came
to
an
end
in
that
solution
woman
free
in
all
respects
woman
the
free
companion
of
man
resuming
her
position
as
an
equal
as
an
indispensable
factor
in
the
union
of
love
she
had
a
right
to
abstain
from
marrying
to
live
as
a
man
to
play
a
man
part
as
far
as
she
desired
if
she
chose
but
why
should
she
deny
desire
and
set
herself
apart
from
life
only
one
thing
is
sensible
and
beautiful
and
that
is
life
in
its
entirety
and
so
the
natural
order
of
things
had
come
about
peace
was
signed
between
the
reconciled
sexes
each
finding
happiness
in
the
happiness
of
a
common
home
tasting
at
last
all
the
delights
of
the
bond
of
love
which
was
freed
from
the
baseness
of
pecuniary
and
social
considerations
one
could
no
longer
sell
himself
for
the
other
dowry
families
could
no
longer
barter
their
sons
and
daughters
like
mere
merchandise
thus
the
fulness
of
love
reigned
in
the
community
the
sense
of
love
developed
and
purified
became
the
perfume
the
flame
the
focus
of
existence
it
was
widespread
general
universal
love
springing
from
the
mated
couple
and
passing
to
the
mother
the
father
the
children
the
relations
the
neighbours
the
citizens
the
men
and
women
of
the
whole
world
in
waves
a
sea
of
love
which
ended
by
bathing
the
entire
earth
loving
kindness
was
like
the
pure
air
on
which
every
breast
fed
there
remained
but
one
breath
of
brotherly
affection
and
that
alone
had
at
last
brought
about
the
unity
the
divine
harmony
humanity
equilibrated
like
the
planets
by
force
of
attraction
by
the
law
of
justice
solidarity
and
love
would
henceforth
journey
happily
through
the
eternal
infinite
and
such
was
the
harvest
the
immense
harvest
of
tenderness
and
kindliness
which
luc
each
morning
saw
arising
from
all
sides
from
all
the
furrows
which
he
had
sown
so
abundantly
from
his
entire
city
where
for
so
many
years
he
had
cast
the
good
seed
by
the
handful
into
the
schools
into
the
workshops
into
every
home
and
even
into
every
heart
look
he
said
with
a
laugh
some
morning
when
josine
sÅurette
and
suzanne
remained
near
his
before
the
open
window
there
are
trees
which
have
flowered
since
last
night
and
it
seems
as
if
kisses
were
winging
their
flight
like
from
some
of
the
roofs
there
yonder
both
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
love
flaps
his
wings
as
it
were
in
the
rising
sunlight
the
three
women
joined
in
his
laughter
and
jested
in
a
tender
way
to
please
him
josine
would
say
that
side
above
that
house
with
the
blue
tiles
spangled
with
white
stars
there
is
a
great
quiver
of
the
sunlight
telling
of
internal
rapture
that
must
be
the
house
of
some
pair
straight
before
us
said
sÅurette
how
the
are
flashing
with
the
splendour
of
a
rising
planet
in
that
where
the
faÃ¯ence
ornaments
are
decorated
with
roses
assuredly
a
child
has
been
born
there
on
all
sides
over
all
the
dwellings
over
the
whole
town
the
rays
are
pouring
said
suzanne
in
her
turn
form
sheaves
of
wheat
a
field
of
prodigious
fertility
is
it
not
the
peace
springing
from
the
love
of
all
that
grows
and
is
harvested
there
each
day
luc
listened
to
them
with
rapture
what
a
delightful
reward
was
that
which
he
himself
had
won
from
love
which
had
surrounded
him
with
the
sublime
affection
of
those
three
women
whose
presence
filled
his
last
days
with
perfume
and
brilliancy
they
were
full
of
solicitude
infinitely
good
infinitely
loving
with
serene
eyes
which
ever
brought
him
joy
in
life
and
gentle
hands
which
sustained
him
to
the
very
threshold
of
the
grave
and
they
were
very
old
and
quite
white
light
and
aerial
like
souls
like
gay
active
pure
flames
glowing
with
youthful
eternal
passion
he
lived
on
and
they
lived
on
also
and
were
like
his
force
his
activity
and
intelligence
healthy
and
strong
as
they
were
in
spite
of
everything
coming
and
going
for
him
when
he
himself
could
no
longer
move
like
guardians
housewives
and
companions
who
prolonged
and
broadened
his
life
far
beyond
the
usual
limits
at
years
of
age
josine
remained
the
the
eve
who
had
long
ago
been
saved
from
error
and
suffering
extremely
slim
suggesting
a
dry
pallid
flower
that
had
retained
its
perfume
she
had
preserved
her
supple
gracefulness
her
delicate
charm
in
the
bright
sunlight
her
white
hair
seemed
to
recover
some
of
its
golden
hue
the
sovereign
gold
of
youth
and
luc
adored
her
still
as
on
the
distant
day
when
he
had
succoured
her
setting
in
his
love
for
her
his
love
for
the
whole
suffering
people
for
all
tortured
women
choosing
her
indeed
as
the
most
wretched
the
most
dolorous
in
order
that
with
her
should
he
save
her
he
might
likewise
save
all
the
disinherited
of
the
world
whom
shame
and
hunger
were
clutching
at
the
throat
even
nowadays
it
was
religiously
that
he
kissed
her
mutilated
hand
the
wound
dealt
by
iniquitous
labour
in
the
prison
of
the
from
which
his
compassion
and
love
for
her
had
helped
him
to
extricate
the
workers
he
had
not
remained
unfruitful
in
his
mission
of
redemption
and
deliverance
he
had
felt
the
need
of
woman
the
necessity
of
being
strong
and
complete
in
order
to
redeem
his
brothers
it
was
the
mated
couple
the
fruitful
spouse
that
had
given
birth
to
the
new
people
when
she
had
borne
him
children
his
work
itself
had
begun
to
create
had
become
lasting
and
on
her
side
she
likewise
adored
him
with
the
adoration
of
their
first
meeting
a
flame
of
tender
gratitude
a
gift
of
her
whole
person
a
passion
and
a
desire
for
the
infinite
of
love
whose
inextinguishable
flame
age
had
not
weakened
sÅurette
born
the
same
year
as
luc
her
birthday
being
near
at
hand
was
the
most
active
of
the
three
women
on
her
feet
busy
the
whole
day
long
it
had
long
seemed
as
if
she
had
ceased
to
grow
older
small
of
frame
shrunken
even
she
had
nevertheless
been
beautified
by
gentle
age
so
dark
so
thin
so
graceless
in
former
times
she
had
become
a
delightful
little
old
woman
a
little
white
mouse
whose
eyes
were
full
of
light
long
ago
in
the
distressing
crisis
of
her
love
for
luc
amidst
her
grief
at
loving
and
remaining
unloved
her
good
brother
jordan
had
told
her
that
she
would
become
resigned
and
would
sacrifice
her
passion
to
the
love
of
others
and
each
day
she
had
indeed
become
more
and
more
resigned
her
renunciation
proving
at
last
a
source
of
pure
joy
a
force
of
divine
delight
she
still
loved
luc
she
loved
him
in
each
of
his
children
and
grandchildren
with
whom
she
had
long
assisted
josine
and
she
loved
him
with
a
deeper
and
deeper
love
freed
from
all
egotism
a
chaste
flame
that
glowed
with
sisterly
affection
and
motherliness
the
delicate
attentions
the
discreet
comforts
which
she
had
lavished
on
her
brother
were
now
bestowed
on
her
friend
she
was
always
on
the
watch
in
order
to
make
his
every
hour
delight
and
all
her
happiness
lay
in
that
to
feel
how
greatly
he
himself
was
attached
to
her
to
end
almost
a
century
of
life
in
that
passionate
friendship
which
was
as
sweet
as
love
itself
suzanne
now
years
of
age
was
the
eldest
the
most
serious
the
most
venerable
of
the
women
slender
of
figure
she
remained
upright
showing
a
tender
countenance
whose
only
charm
as
in
days
before
rested
in
its
expression
of
kindliness
indulgence
and
sterling
good
sense
but
nowadays
she
could
scarcely
walk
and
her
compassionate
eyes
alone
expressed
her
craving
to
interest
herself
in
others
and
expend
her
strength
in
good
work
as
a
rule
she
remained
seated
near
luc
keeping
him
company
whilst
josine
and
sÅurette
quietly
and
attentively
trotted
around
them
she
on
her
side
had
loved
luc
so
tenderly
in
her
sad
younger
days
loved
him
with
a
consoling
love
of
which
she
had
long
remained
ignorant
she
had
given
herself
without
knowing
it
amidst
her
dream
of
a
hero
whom
she
would
have
liked
to
encourage
assist
with
her
affection
and
on
the
day
when
her
heart
had
spoken
the
hero
was
already
in
another
arms
and
only
room
for
a
friend
remained
at
his
hearth
she
had
been
that
friend
for
numerous
years
now
and
had
found
perfect
peace
in
the
communion
of
heart
and
mind
in
which
she
had
lived
with
the
man
who
had
become
her
brother
doubtless
too
as
in
the
case
of
sÅurette
if
that
friendship
proved
so
delightful
it
was
because
it
had
sprung
from
a
brasier
of
love
and
retained
its
eternal
fire
thus
luc
very
aged
glorious
and
handsome
lived
his
last
days
encompassed
by
the
love
of
those
three
women
who
also
were
very
old
glorious
and
beautiful
his
years
had
failed
to
bend
his
lofty
figure
he
remained
healthy
and
strong
save
for
that
stiffening
of
his
legs
which
kept
him
at
his
window
like
a
happy
spectator
of
the
city
he
had
founded
his
hair
had
not
fallen
from
above
his
lofty
towering
brow
it
had
simply
whitened
surrounding
his
head
with
a
great
white
mane
like
that
of
some
old
resting
lion
and
his
last
days
were
brightened
and
perfumed
by
the
adoration
with
which
josine
sÅurette
and
suzanne
surrounded
him
he
had
loved
all
three
of
them
and
still
loved
them
with
that
vast
love
of
his
whence
flowed
so
much
desire
so
much
brotherliness
and
kindness
but
signs
appeared
as
with
jordan
no
doubt
the
work
being
done
luc
was
soon
to
die
somnolence
came
over
him
like
a
foretaste
of
the
repose
whose
advent
he
awaited
with
joyous
serenity
it
was
with
good
spirits
that
he
saw
death
approaching
for
he
knew
it
to
be
necessary
and
gentle
and
he
had
no
need
of
any
mendacious
promise
of
a
heaven
in
order
to
accept
it
with
a
brave
heart
heaven
henceforth
was
set
upon
the
earth
where
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
truth
and
justice
realised
the
ideal
the
entirety
of
human
happiness
each
being
remained
immortal
in
the
generations
born
of
him
the
torrent
of
love
was
increased
by
each
fresh
love
that
came
into
being
and
rolled
and
rolled
along
assuring
eternity
to
all
who
had
lived
loved
and
created
and
luc
knew
that
although
he
might
die
he
would
continually
be
born
anew
in
the
innumerable
men
whose
lives
he
had
desired
to
see
improved
more
fortunate
that
was
the
only
certainty
of
survival
and
it
brought
him
delightful
peace
he
had
loved
others
so
much
and
had
expended
his
strength
so
much
for
the
relief
of
their
wretchedness
that
he
found
reward
and
beatitude
in
falling
asleep
in
them
in
profiting
himself
by
his
work
in
the
bosom
of
generations
which
would
ever
become
happier
and
happier
anxious
though
they
felt
at
seeing
him
thus
gently
sinking
josine
sÅurette
and
suzanne
did
not
wish
to
be
sad
they
opened
the
windows
every
morning
in
order
that
the
sun
might
enter
freely
they
decorated
and
perfumed
the
room
with
flowers
huge
nosegays
possessing
all
the
brightness
and
aroma
of
youth
and
knowing
how
attached
luc
was
to
children
they
surrounded
him
with
a
joyous
party
of
little
lads
and
lassies
whose
fair
and
dark
heads
were
like
other
nosegays
the
flowery
the
strength
and
beauty
of
the
years
to
come
and
when
all
those
little
folk
were
present
laughing
and
playing
around
his
luc
smiled
at
them
tenderly
and
watched
their
play
with
an
air
of
amusement
enraptured
at
heart
at
departing
amidst
such
pure
delight
such
living
hope
now
on
the
day
when
death
very
just
and
very
good
was
to
come
upon
luc
with
the
twilight
the
three
women
who
divined
its
approach
by
the
expression
in
the
clear
eyes
of
the
grand
old
man
sent
for
his
the
very
little
ones
those
who
would
set
the
most
childhood
the
most
future
promise
around
him
in
his
last
moments
and
these
children
brought
others
playmates
and
so
forth
some
of
them
their
elders
and
all
of
them
descendants
of
the
workers
by
whose
solidarity
and
exertion
la
crÃªcherie
had
formerly
been
founded
it
was
a
charming
spectacle
that
sunlit
room
full
of
children
and
roses
and
the
hero
the
old
lion
with
the
white
mane
still
cheerfully
and
lovingly
taking
an
interest
in
the
little
ones
he
recognised
them
all
named
them
and
questioned
them
a
tall
lad
of
eighteen
franÃ§ois
the
son
of
hippolyte
mitaine
and
laure
fauchard
strove
to
restrain
his
tears
as
he
looked
at
him
and
shake
hands
with
me
my
handsome
franÃ§ois
said
luc
must
not
be
sad
you
see
how
cheerful
we
all
are
and
be
a
good
man
you
have
grown
taller
lately
you
will
make
a
superb
sweetheart
for
some
charming
girl
then
came
the
turn
of
two
girls
of
fifteen
amÃ©lie
the
daughter
of
alexandre
feuillat
and
clÃ©mentine
bourron
and
simonne
the
daughter
of
adolphe
laboque
and
germaine
yvonnot
you
at
least
are
gay
my
pretty
ones
said
luc
it
is
right
that
you
should
be
so
come
and
let
me
kiss
you
on
your
fresh
cheeks
and
be
always
gay
and
beautiful
for
therein
lies
happiness
then
he
only
recognised
his
own
descendants
whose
number
was
destined
to
multiply
without
cessation
two
of
his
grandchildren
were
present
a
granddaughter
aged
eighteen
alice
who
had
sprung
from
charles
froment
and
claudine
bonnaire
and
a
grandson
of
sixteen
richard
who
had
sprung
from
jules
froment
and
cÃ©line
lenfant
only
the
unmarried
grandchildren
had
been
invited
for
the
room
could
not
have
held
the
married
ones
with
their
wives
and
families
and
luc
laughed
yet
more
tenderly
as
he
called
alice
and
richard
to
him
fair
alice
said
he
are
of
an
age
to
marry
now
choose
a
lad
who
is
joyous
and
healthy
like
yourself
ah
is
it
done
already
then
love
one
another
well
and
may
your
children
be
as
healthy
and
joyous
as
you
and
you
richard
my
big
fellow
you
are
about
to
begin
your
apprenticeship
as
a
bootmaker
i
hear
and
you
also
have
a
perfect
passion
for
music
well
work
and
sing
and
be
a
genius
but
at
this
moment
he
was
surrounded
by
a
stream
of
little
ones
three
boys
and
a
girl
all
of
them
his
grandchildren
tried
to
climb
upon
his
knees
he
began
by
taking
the
eldest
a
boy
of
seven
georges
the
son
of
a
pair
of
cousins
maurice
morfain
and
berthe
jollivet
maurice
being
the
son
of
raymond
morfain
and
thÃ©rÃ¨se
froment
whilst
berthe
was
one
of
the
daughters
of
andrÃ©
jollivet
and
pauline
froment
my
dear
little
georges
the
dear
little
grandson
of
my
two
daughters
thÃ©rÃ¨se
the
brunette
and
pauline
the
blonde
your
eyes
used
to
be
like
my
pauline
but
now
they
are
becoming
like
those
of
my
thÃ©rÃ¨se
and
your
fresh

good
kiss
a
good
kiss
my
dear
little
georges
so
that
you
may
remember
me
for
a
long
long
time
then
came
the
turn
of
grÃ©goire
bonnaire
who
was
barely
five
years
old
he
was
the
son
of
fÃ©licien
bonnaire
and
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
jollivet
fÃ©licien
having
sprung
from
sÃ©verin
bonnaire
and
lÃ©onie
gourier
and
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
being
the
daughter
of
andrÃ©
jollivet
and
pauline
froment
of
my
pauline
little
men
said

be
good
and
handsome
when
you
remember
me
eh
kiss

me
a
good
kiss
by
way
of
conclusion
he
took
up
the
two
others
clÃ©ment
and
luce
brother
and
sister
one
on
his
right
and
the
other
on
his
left
knee
clÃ©ment
was
five
and
luce
two
years
old
they
were
the
children
of
ludovic
boisgelin
and
mariette
froment
but
at
the
thought
of
ludovic
and
mariette
a
host
of
memories
arose
for
he
was
the
son
of
paul
boisgelin
and
antoinette
bonnaire
and
she
the
daughter
of
hilaire
froment
and
colette
the
eldest
child
of
nanet
and
nise
the
delaveaus
the
boisgelins
the
bonnaires
mingling
with
the
froments
were
born
anew
in
those
pure
brows
that
light
and
curly
hair
little
clÃ©ment
come
little
luce
my
pets
said
luc
you
only
knew
all
that
i
recognise
all
that
i
read
in
the
depths
of
your
bright
eyes
you
are
already
very
good
and
strong
little
clÃ©ment
i
know
it
well
for
grandfather
hilaire
has
told
me
and
is
well
pleased
to
hear
you
always
laughing
and
you
little
luce
my
little
mite
who
can
scarcely
talk
one
knows
that
you
are
a
brave
little
girl
for
you
never
cry
but
gaily
stretch
your
chubby
little
hands
towards
the
good
sun
you
also
must
kiss
me
my
beautiful
children
the
best
of
myself
all
my
strength
and
all
my
hope
the
others
had
drawn
near
and
he
would
have
liked
to
have
had
arms
long
enough
to
embrace
and
press
every
one
of
them
to
his
heart
it
was
to
them
that
he
confided
the
future
that
he
bequeathed
his
work
as
to
new
forces
which
would
ever
enlarge
it
he
had
always
relied
on
the
children
the
future
generations
to
complete
the
work
of
happiness
and
those
dear
children
who
had
sprung
from
him
and
by
whom
he
was
so
lovingly
surrounded
in
the
serene
peacefulness
of
his
last
hour
what
a
testament
of
justice
truth
and
kindness
he
left
them
and
with
what
intense
passion
he
appointed
them
the
executors
of
his
will
his
dream
of
humanity
freed
more
and
more
and
dwelling
together
in
happiness
go
my
dear
children
be
good
very
good
and
very
just
with
one
another
remember
that
you
all
kissed
me
and
always
love
me
well
and
love
each
other
well
also
you
will
know
everything
some
day
you
will
do
as
we
have
done
and
it
will
be
for
your
children
to
do
as
you
do
let
there
be
plenty
of
work
plenty
of
life
and
plenty
of
love
meantime
my
dear
children
go
and
play
and
keep
full
of
health
and
gaiety
josine
sÅurette
and
suzanne
then
wished
to
send
the
joyous
band
home
for
fear
of
a
noise
as
they
could
see
that
luc
was
growing
weaker
and
weaker
but
he
would
not
consent
to
this
he
desired
that
the
children
might
remain
near
him
in
order
that
he
might
gently
depart
amidst
the
joyous
sounds
of
their
laughter
it
was
then
arranged
that
they
should
play
in
the
garden
under
his
window
he
could
thus
hear
and
see
them
and
felt
well
pleased
the
sun
a
great
summer
sun
which
made
the
whole
town
resplendent
was
already
sinking
on
the
horizon
it
gilded
the
room
as
with
a
glory
and
luc
seated
in
his
amidst
that
splendour
long
remained
silent
gazing
the
while
far
away
josine
and
sÅurette
silent
like
himself
came
and
leant
one
on
his
right
the
other
on
his
left
whilst
suzanne
seated
close
by
appeared
to
be
sharing
his
dream
at
last
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
distant
he
slowly
said
our
town
is
yonder
regenerated
beauclair
scintillates
in
the
pure
atmosphere
and
i
know
that
the
neighbouring
towns
brias
magnolles
formerie
and
have
followed
us
won
over
by
our
example
to
the
cause
of
happiness
but
what
is
becoming
of
the
world
beyond
the
horizon
on
the
other
side
of
the
bleuse
mountains
and
beyond
the
great
dim
plain
of
la
roumagne
what
point
have
the
provinces
and
nations
reached
in
the
long
struggle
the
difficult
and
bloody
march
towards
the
happy
city
again
he
became
silent
full
of
thought
he
was
aware
that
the
evolution
was
in
progress
everywhere
spreading
each
hour
with
increasing
speed
from
the
towns
the
movement
had
gained
the
provinces
then
the
whole
nation
and
then
the
neighbouring
nations
and
there
were
no
more
frontiers
no
more
insurmountable
mountains
and
oceans
deliverance
flew
from
continent
to
continent
sweeping
away
governments
and
religions
and
uniting
races
however
things
did
not
on
all
sides
take
the
same
course
whilst
the
evolution
in
the
form
of
a
slow
advance
towards
the
conquest
of
every
liberty
had
progressed
at
beauclair
without
too
much
battling
thanks
to
the
experiment
of
association
made
there
on
other
sides
it
was
revolution
which
had
broken
out
and
blood
had
flowed
amidst
massacre
and
conflagration
no
two
neighbouring
states
indeed
had
taken
the
same
road
it
was
after
following
the
most
varied
and
contrary
paths
that
the
nations
were
to
meet
at
last
in
one
and
the
same
fraternal
city
the
metropolis
of
the
human
federation
and
luc
as
in
a
dream
repeated
in
his
failing
voice
i
should
like
to
know
yes
before
quitting
my
work
i
should
like
to
know
how
far
the
great
task
has
now
advanced
i
should
sleep
better
i
should
carry
yet
more
certainty
and
hope
away
with
me
silence
fell
again
josine
sÅurette
and
suzanne
very
old
very
beautiful
and
very
good
were
like
himself
still
dreaming
with
their
glances
wandering
afar
it
was
at
last
josine
who
began
have
heard
of
things
a
traveller
told
them
me
she
said
one
great
republic
the
collectivists
became
the
masters
of
power
for
years
they
had
waged
the
most
desperate
of
political
battles
in
order
to
gain
possession
of
the
legislature
and
the
government
and
as
they
were
unable
to
do
so
in
legal
fashion
they
had
recourse
to
a
when
they
felt
strong
enough
for
one
and
certain
of
substantial
support
among
the
nation
on
the
morrow
by
laws
and
decrees
they
put
their
entire
programme
into
force
expropriation
began
all
private
wealth
became
the
wealth
of
the
nation
all
the
instruments
of
work
reverted
to
the
workers
no
landowners
nor
capitalists
nor
employers
were
left
the
state
reigned
alone
master
of
everything
both
landowner
and
capitalist
and
employer
regulator
and
distributor
of
social
life
but
of
course
that
tremendous
shock
those
sudden
radical
changes
could
not
take
place
without
terrible
troubles
arising
the
classes
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
dispossessed
even
of
property
they
had
stolen
and
there
were
frightful
outbreaks
on
all
sides
landowners
preferred
to
get
killed
on
the
threshold
of
their
estates
other
people
destroyed
their
property
flooded
mines
broke
up
railroads
annihilated
factories
and
goods
whilst
capitalists
burnt
their
scrip
and
flung
their
gold
into
the
sea
certain
houses
had
to
be
besieged
whole
towns
had
to
be
taken
by
assault
that
frightful
civil
war
lasted
for
years
and
the
pavements
of
the
towns
became
red
with
blood
whilst
the
rivers
still
and
ever
carried
corpses
to
the
ocean
then
the
sovereign
state
experienced
all
sorts
of
difficulties
in
getting
the
new
order
of
things
to
work
smoothly
an
hour
work
became
the
standard
of
value
exchanges
being
facilitated
by
a
system
of
vouchers
at
first
a
statistical
commission
was
established
to
watch
over
production
and
distribute
products
in
accordance
with
each
person
amount
of
work
then
other
controlling
offices
were
found
necessary
and
little
by
little
an
intricate
organisation
grew
up
impeding
the
working
of
the
new
social
system
people
fell
into
a
kind
of
regimentation
and
barrack
life
never
had
men
been
penned
up
in
smaller
compartments
and
yet
evolution
was
taking
place
even
this
was
a
step
towards
justice
for
work
rose
to
honour
once
more
and
wealth
was
each
day
divided
with
more
equity
at
the
end
assuredly
there
lay
the
disappearance
of
the
and
of
capital
the
suppression
of
trade
and
money
and
i
have
been
told
that
this
collectivist
state
ravaged
by
so
many
catastrophes
deluged
with
so
much
blood
is
entering
the
sphere
of
peace
coming
at
last
to
the
fraternal
solidarity
of
the
free
working
nations
josine
ceased
speaking
and
again
relapsed
into
a
mute
contemplation
of
the
great
horizon
but
luc
gently
replied
that
was
one
of
the
bloody
paths
one
of
those
which
i
would
not
follow
but
now
what
matters
it
since
it
has
led
them
to
the
same
unity
the
same
harmony
as
our
own
then
sÅurette
still
gazing
far
away
as
if
exploring
the
world
behind
the
gigantic
promontories
of
the
bleuse
mountains
in
her
turn
took
up
the
tale
also
heard
a
story
some
told
me
these
frightful
things
they
happened
in
a
vast
neighbouring
empire
where
the
anarchists
by
means
of
bombs
and
shrapnel
succeeded
in
blowing
up
the
old
social
framework
the
people
had
suffered
so
dreadfully
that
they
ended
by
leaguing
themselves
with
the
anarchists
in
order
to
complete
the
liberating
work
of
destruction
and
sweep
away
the
last
crumbs
of
the
rotten
world
for
a
long
time
the
cities
flared
like
torches
in
the
night
amidst
the
howling
of
the
old
butchers
of
the
people
who
in
their
turn
were
now
being
slaughtered
and
who
did
not
wish
to
die
and
this
was
the
prophesied
deluge
of
blood
the
fruitful
necessity
of
which
had
long
been
foretold
by
the
prophets
of
anarchy
afterwards
the
new
times
began
the
cry
was
no
longer
to
each
according
to
his
work
but
to
each
according
to
his
needs
man
had
a
right
to
life
lodging
clothing
and
daily
bread
so
all
the
wealth
was
heaped
together
and
divided
people
only
being
rationed
when
there
was
a
lack
of
abundance
but
with
all
mankind
at
work
and
nature
exploited
scientifically
and
methodically
there
must
come
incalculable
produce
an
immense
fortune
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
appetites
of
all
when
the
thieving
and
parasitic
society
of
olden
time
had
disappeared
together
with
money
the
source
of
all
crimes
and
the
savage
laws
of
restriction
and
repression
which
had
been
the
sources
of
every
iniquity
peace
would
reign
in
the
libertarian
community
in
which
the
happiness
of
each
would
be
derived
from
the
happiness
of
all
and
there
was
to
be
no
more
authority
of
any
kind
no
more
laws
no
more
government
if
the
anarchists
had
accepted
iron
and
fire
as
their
instruments
believing
in
the
sanguinary
necessity
of
extermination
as
a
first
step
it
was
because
they
were
convinced
that
they
could
not
utterly
destroy
monarchical
and
religious
atavism
and
for
ever
crush
the
last
surviving
germs
of
authority
unless
the
ancient
sore
should
be
thus
brutally
cauterised
in
order
that
one
might
not
be
caught
in
the
toils
again
it
was
necessary
to
sever
every
living
link
with
a
past
of
error
and
despotism
all
politics
were
evil
and
poisonous
because
they
were
fatally
compounded
of
compromises
and
bargains
in
which
the
disinherited
were
duped
and
the
lofty
pure
dream
of
anarchy
had
sought
realisation
when
the
old
world
had
been
ruined
and
swept
away
that
dream
was
the
broadest
and
the
most
ideal
conception
of
a
just
and
peaceful
human
race
man
free
in
a
free
state
of
society
and
each
man
delivered
from
every
hindrance
and
shackle
living
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
all
his
senses
and
faculties
fully
exercising
his
right
to
live
and
to
be
happy
through
his
share
in
the
possession
of
all
the
wealth
of
the
earth
but
then
anarchy
had
gradually
become
merged
into
the
communist
evolution
for
in
reality
it
was
only
a
form
of
political
negation
and
simply
differed
from
other
kinds
of
socialism
by
its
determination
to
throw
everything
down
before
building
up
afresh
it
accepted
association
the
constitution
of
free
groups
living
by
exchanges
constantly
circulating
expending
their
strength
and
reconstituting
themselves
like
the
very
blood
of
the
human
body
and
thus
the
great
empire
where
it
triumphed
amidst
massacre
and
conflagration
has
now
joined
the
other
freed
nations
in
the
universal
federation
sÅurette
ceased
speaking
and
remained
motionless
and
dreamy
with
her
elbow
resting
on
the
back
of
luc
he
whose
voice
was
thickening
slowly
said
the
anarchists
after
the
collectivists
were
bound
to
follow
the
disciples
of
fourier
on
the
last
day
on
reaching
the
threshold
of
the
promised
land
if
the
roads
were
different
the
goal
remained
identical
and
after
thinking
a
while
he
resumed
how
many
tears
how
much
blood
how
many
abominable
wars
there
have
been
in
order
to
win
that
fraternal
peace
which
all
equally
desired
how
many
centuries
of
fratricidal
slaughter
have
followed
one
after
the
other
when
the
question
was
simply
whether
one
ought
to
turn
to
right
or
left
in
order
to
reach
happiness
more
quickly
then
suzanne
who
hitherto
had
remained
silent
and
whose
eyes
also
had
been
wandering
beyond
the
horizon
at
last
spoke
in
a
voice
which
quivered
with
compassion
the
last
war
the
last
battle
it
was
so
frightful
that
when
it
was
over
men
for
ever
destroyed
their
swords
and
their
guns
it
took
place
during
the
earlier
stage
of
the
great
social
crises
which
have
renewed
the
world
and
i
was
told
of
it
by
men
who
had
well
nigh
lost
their
senses
amidst
that
supreme
shock
of
the
nations
in
that
crisis
which
distracted
them
whilst
they
were
pregnant
with
the
future
of
europe
rushed
upon
the
other
half
and
other
continents
followed
them
and
fleets
of
ships
battled
on
all
the
oceans
for
dominion
over
water
and
earth
not
a
single
nation
was
able
to
remain
apart
in
a
state
of
neutrality
they
all
dragged
one
another
forward
and
two
immense
armies
entered
into
line
glowing
with
hereditary
fury
and
resolved
upon
exterminating
one
another
as
if
out
of
every
two
men
there
was
one
too
many
in
the
empty
barren
fields
and
the
two
huge
armies
of
hostile
brothers
met
in
the
centre
of
europe
on
some
vast
plains
where
millions
of
beings
had
space
to
murder
one
another
over
leagues
and
leagues
did
the
troops
deploy
followed
by
reinforcements
such
a
torrent
of
men
indeed
that
the
battle
lasted
for
a
month
each
day
that
dawned
there
still
remained
human
flesh
for
bullets
and
shells
the
combatants
did
not
even
take
time
to
remove
their
dead
the
piles
of
corpses
formed
walls
behind
which
new
regiments
ever
advanced
in
order
to
get
killed
and
night
did
not
stay
the
battle
men
murdered
one
another
in
the
darkness
each
time
that
the
sun
arose
it
illumined
yet
larger
pools
of
blood
a
field
of
carnage
where
death
in
his
horrible
harvesting
piled
the
corpses
of
the
soldiers
in
loftier
and
loftier
ricks
and
on
all
sides
there
was
lightning
entire
army
corps
disappeared
amidst
a
clap
of
thunder
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
combatants
should
draw
near
or
even
see
each
other
their
guns
carried
long
miles
and
threw
shells
which
in
exploding
swept
acres
of
ground
bare
and
asphyxiated
and
poisoned
all
around
balloons
also
threw
bombs
from
the
very
heavens
setting
towns
ablaze
as
they
passed
science
had
invented
explosives
and
murderous
engines
which
carried
death
over
prodigious
distances
and
annihilated
a
whole
community
as
suddenly
as
an
earthquake
might
have
done
and
what
a
monstrous
massacre
showed
forth
on
the
last
evening
of
that
gigantic
battle
never
before
had
such
a
huge
human
sacrifice
smoked
beneath
the
heavens
more
than
a
million
men
lay
there
in
the
great
ravaged
fields
alongside
the
watercourses
across
the
meadows
one
could
walk
for
hours
and
hours
and
one
ever
met
a
yet
larger
harvest
of
slaughtered
soldiers
who
lay
there
with
their
eyes
wide
open
and
their
black
mouths
agape
as
if
to
cry
aloud
that
mankind
was
mad
and
that
was
the
last
battle
to
such
a
degree
did
horror
freeze
every
heart
when
men
awakened
from
that
frightful
intoxication
born
of
greed
for
dominion
lust
for
power
whilst
the
conviction
came
to
all
that
war
was
no
longer
possible
since
science
in
its
almightiness
was
destined
to
be
the
sovereign
creator
of
life
and
not
the
artisan
of
destruction
then
suzanne
in
her
turn
relapsed
into
silence
quivering
the
while
but
with
bright
eyes
radiant
indeed
with
the
peace
of
the
future
and
luc
whose
voice
was
becoming
a
mere
breath
concluded
war
is
dead
the
supreme
has
been
reached
the
brotherly
kiss
comes
after
the
long
rough
dolorous
journey
and
my
day
is
over
i
can
now
go
to
sleep
he
spoke
no
more
that
last
minute
was
august
and
sweet
josine
sÅurette
and
suzanne
did
not
stir
but
waited
exempt
from
sadness
full
indeed
of
tender
fervour
in
that
calm
room
gay
with
flowers
and
sunshine
under
the
window
the
joyous
children
were
still
playing
one
could
hear
the
shrill
cries
of
the
very
little
ones
and
the
laughter
of
their
elders
all
the
mirth
of
the
future
on
the
march
to
broader
and
broader
joys
and
then
there
was
the
friendly
sun
resplendent
on
the
horizon
the
sun
the
fertiliser
the
father
whose
creative
force
had
been
captured
and
domesticated
and
under
the
flaring
of
its
rays
of
glory
appeared
the
glittering
roofs
of
triumphant
beauclair
the
busy
hive
where
by
a
just
apportionment
of
this
world
riches
regenerated
work
now
only
created
happy
folk
and
yet
again
beyond
la
roumagne
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
bleuse
mountains
there
was
the
coming
federation
of
the
peoples
the
one
sole
brotherly
nation
mankind
at
last
fulfilling
its
destiny
of
truth
and
justice
and
peace
then
for
the
last
time
luc
gazed
around
him
his
glance
embracing
the
town
the
horizon
the
whole
earth
where
the
evolution
which
he
had
started
was
progressing
and
drawing
nigh
to
completion
the
work
was
done
the
city
was
founded
and
luc
expired
entered
into
the
torrent
of
universal
love
and
of
everlasting
life
the
end
