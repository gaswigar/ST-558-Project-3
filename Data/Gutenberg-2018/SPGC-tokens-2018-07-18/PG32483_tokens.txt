explanation

the

after
chapter
the
map
is
meant
to
give
the
names
of
such
places
only
as
are
mentioned
in
the
history
the
bounds
of
the
patriarchates
of
constantinople
antioch
and
jerusalem
are
marked
as
they
were
settled
at
the
council
of
chalcedon
in
the
year
only
the
northern
part
of
the
alexandrian
patriarchate
is
seen
as
the
map
does
not
reach
far
enough
to
take
in
abyssinia
which
belonged
to
it
at
the
time
of
the
council
of
nicæa
the
bishop
of
patriarchate
was
confined
to
the
middle
and
the
south
of
italy
with
the
islands
of
sicily
sardinia
and
corsica
it
afterwards
grew
by
degrees
until
at
length
it
took
in
all
the
countries
of
the
west
although
it
had
lost
illyricum
which
was
once
a
part
of
it
but
this
was
not
until
long
after
the
time
to
which
our
little
book
relates
and
in
the
meanwhile
its
extent
varied
very
much
the
reason
why
its
bounds
at
the
time
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
or
in
the
days
of
gregory
the
great
can
not
well
be
marked
in
a
map
is
that
in
some
countries
the
bishops
of
rome
had
much
but
had
not
they
gave
to
the
bishops
of
gaul
or
france
spain
and
africa
and
sometimes
ventured
to
give
them
but
they
could
not
make
the
bishops
of
those
countries
obey
their
directions
and
had
not
over
them
in
the
same
way
as
the
patriarchs
of
constantinople
alexandria
antioch
or
jerusalem
had
over
the
bishops
within
their
patriarchates
to
mark
such
countries
as
belonging
to
the
roman
patriarchate
would
be
too
much
to
mark
them
as
if
they
had
no
connexion
with
it
would
be
too
little
sketches
of
church
history
chapter
i
the
age
of
the
apostles
from
to
the
beginning
of
the
christian
church
is
reckoned
from
the
great
day
on
which
the
holy
ghost
came
down
according
as
our
lord
had
promised
to
his
apostles
at
that
time
jews
devout
men
out
of
every
nation
under
heaven
were
gathered
together
at
jerusalem
to
keep
the
feast
of
pentecost
or
feast
of
weeks
which
was
one
of
the
three
holy
seasons
at
which
god
required
his
people
to
appear
before
him
in
the
place
which
he
had
chosen
xvi
many
of
these
devout
men
were
converted
by
what
they
then
saw
and
heard
to
believe
the
gospel
and
when
they
returned
to
their
own
countries
they
carried
back
with
them
the
news
of
the
wonderful
things
which
had
taken
place
at
jerusalem
after
this
the
apostles
went
forth
into
all
the
world
as
their
master
had
ordered
them
to
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
xvi
the
book
of
acts
tells
us
something
of
what
they
did
and
we
may
learn
something
more
about
it
from
the
epistles
and
although
this
be
but
a
small
part
of
the
whole
it
will
give
us
a
notion
of
the
rest
if
we
consider
that
while
paul
was
preaching
in
asia
minor
in
greece
and
at
rome
the
other
apostles
were
busily
doing
the
same
work
in
other
countries
we
must
remember
too
the
constant
coming
and
going
which
in
those
days
took
place
throughout
the
world
how
jews
from
all
quarters
went
up
to
keep
the
passover
and
other
feasts
at
jerusalem
how
the
great
roman
empire
stretched
from
our
own
island
of
britain
as
far
as
persia
and
ethiopia
and
people
from
all
parts
of
it
were
continually
going
to
rome
and
returning
we
must
consider
how
merchants
travelled
from
country
to
country
on
account
of
their
trade
how
soldiers
were
sent
into
all
quarters
of
the
empire
and
were
moved
about
from
one
country
to
another
and
from
these
things
we
may
get
some
understanding
of
the
way
in
which
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
would
be
spread
when
once
it
had
taken
root
in
the
great
cities
of
jerusalem
and
rome
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
by
the
end
of
the
first
hundred
years
after
our
birth
something
was
known
of
the
christian
faith
throughout
all
the
roman
empire
and
even
in
countries
beyond
it
and
if
in
many
cases
only
a
very
little
was
known
still
even
that
was
a
gain
and
served
as
a
preparation
for
more
the
last
chapter
of
the
acts
leaves
paul
at
rome
waiting
for
his
trial
on
account
of
the
things
which
the
jews
had
laid
to
his
charge
we
find
from
the
epistles
that
he
afterwards
got
his
liberty
and
returned
into
the
east
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
he
also
visited
spain
as
he
had
spoken
of
doing
in
his
epistle
to
the
romans
ch
xv
and
it
has
been
thought
by
some
that
he
even
preached
in
britain
but
this
does
not
seem
likely
he
was
at
last
imprisoned
again
at
rome
where
the
wicked
emperor
nero
persecuted
the
christians
very
cruelly
and
it
is
believed
that
both
peter
and
paul
were
put
to
death
there
in
the
year
of
our
lord
the
bishops
of
rome
afterwards
set
up
claims
to
great
power
and
honour
because
they
said
that
peter
was
the
first
bishop
of
their
church
and
that
they
were
his
successors
but
although
we
may
reasonably
believe
that
the
apostle
was
martyred
at
rome
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
good
ground
for
thinking
that
he
had
been
settled
there
as
bishop
of
the
city
all
the
apostles
except
john
are
supposed
to
have
been
martyred
or
put
to
death
for
the
sake
of
the
gospel
james
the
less
who
was
bishop
of
jerusalem
was
killed
by
the
jews
in
an
uproar
about
the
year
soon
after
this
the
romans
sent
their
armies
into
judea
and
after
a
bloody
war
they
took
the
city
of
jerusalem
destroyed
the
temple
and
scattered
the
jews
all
over
the
earth
thus
the
jews
were
punished
as
our
lord
had
foretold
for
the
great
sin
of
which
they
had
been
guilty
in
refusing
to
believe
in
him
and
in
putting
him
to
death
thirty
years
after
nero
time
another
cruel
emperor
domitian
raised
a
fresh
persecution
against
the
christians
among
those
who
suffered
were
some
of
his
own
near
relations
for
the
gospel
had
now
made
its
way
among
the
great
people
of
the
earth
as
well
as
among
the
poor
who
were
the
first
to
listen
to
it
there
is
a
story
that
the
emperor
was
told
that
some
persons
of
the
family
of
david
were
living
in
the
holy
land
and
that
he
sent
for
them
because
he
was
afraid
lest
the
jews
should
set
them
up
as
princes
and
should
rebel
against
his
government
they
were
two
grandchildren
of
jude
who
was
one
of
our
lord
kinsmen
after
the
flesh
and
therefore
belonged
to
the
house
of
david
and
the
old
kings
of
judah
but
these
two
were
plain
countrymen
who
lived
quietly
and
contentedly
on
their
little
farm
and
were
not
likely
to
lead
a
rebellion
or
to
claim
earthly
kingdoms
and
when
they
were
carried
before
the
emperor
they
showed
him
their
hands
which
were
rough
and
horny
from
working
in
the
fields
and
in
answer
to
his
questions
about
the
kingdom
of
christ
they
said
that
it
was
not
of
this
world
but
spiritual
and
heavenly
and
that
it
would
appear
at
the
end
of
the
world
when
the
saviour
would
come
again
to
judge
both
the
quick
and
the
dead
so
the
emperor
saw
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
them
and
he
let
them
go
it
was
during
domitian
persecution
that
john
was
banished
to
the
island
of
patmos
where
he
saw
the
visions
which
are
described
in
his
revelation
all
the
other
apostles
had
been
long
dead
and
john
had
lived
many
years
at
ephesus
where
he
governed
the
churches
of
the
country
around
after
his
return
from
patmos
he
went
about
to
all
these
churches
that
he
might
repair
the
hurt
which
they
had
suffered
in
the
persecution
in
one
of
the
towns
which
he
visited
he
noticed
a
young
man
of
very
pleasing
looks
and
called
him
forward
and
desired
the
bishop
of
the
place
to
take
care
of
him
the
bishop
did
so
and
after
having
properly
trained
the
youth
he
baptised
and
confirmed
him
but
when
this
had
been
done
the
bishop
thought
that
he
need
not
watch
over
him
so
carefully
as
before
and
the
young
man
fell
into
vicious
company
and
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
until
at
length
he
became
the
head
of
a
band
of
robbers
who
kept
the
whole
country
in
terror
when
the
apostle
next
visited
the
town
he
asked
after
the
charge
which
he
had
put
into
the
bishop
hands
the
bishop
with
shame
and
grief
answered
that
the
young
man
was
dead
and
on
being
further
questioned
he
explained
that
he
meant
in
and
told
all
the
story
john
after
having
blamed
him
because
he
had
not
taken
more
care
asked
where
the
robbers
were
to
be
found
and
set
off
on
horseback
for
their
haunt
where
he
was
seized
by
some
of
the
band
and
was
carried
before
the
captain
the
young
man
on
seeing
him
knew
him
at
once
and
could
not
bear
his
look
but
ran
away
to
hide
himself
but
the
apostle
called
him
back
told
him
that
there
was
yet
hope
for
him
through
christ
and
spoke
in
such
a
moving
way
that
the
robber
agreed
to
return
to
the
town
there
he
was
once
more
received
into
the
church
as
a
penitent
and
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
days
in
repentance
for
his
sins
and
in
thankfulness
for
the
mercy
which
had
been
shown
to
him
john
in
his
old
age
was
much
troubled
by
false
teachers
who
had
begun
to
corrupt
the
gospel
these
persons
are
called
and
their
doctrines
are
called
from
a
greek
word
which
means
to
because
they
to
follow
their
own
fancies
instead
of
receiving
the
gospel
as
the
apostles
and
the
church
taught
it
simon
the
sorcerer
who
is
mentioned
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
acts
is
counted
as
the
first
heretic
and
even
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
a
number
of
others
arose
such
as
hymenæus
philetus
and
alexander
who
are
mentioned
by
paul
i
ii
these
earliest
heretics
were
mostly
of
the
kind
called
a
word
which
means
that
they
pretended
to
be
more
than
ordinary
christians
and
perhaps
paul
may
have
meant
them
especially
when
he
warned
timothy
against
science
or
falsely
so
called
vi
their
doctrines
were
a
strange
mixture
of
jewish
and
heathen
notions
with
christianity
and
it
is
curious
that
some
of
the
very
strangest
of
their
opinions
have
been
brought
up
again
from
time
to
time
by
people
who
fancied
that
they
had
found
out
something
new
while
they
had
only
fallen
into
old
errors
which
had
been
condemned
by
the
church
hundreds
of
years
before
john
lived
to
about
the
age
of
a
hundred
he
was
at
last
so
weak
that
he
could
not
walk
into
the
church
so
he
was
carried
in
and
used
to
say
continually
to
his
people
little
children
love
one
another
some
of
them
after
a
time
began
to
be
tired
of
hearing
this
and
asked
him
why
he
repeated
the
words
so
often
and
said
nothing
else
to
them
the
apostle
answered
because
it
is
the
lord
commandment
and
if
this
be
done
it
is
enough
chapter
ii
ignatius
when
our
lord
ascended
into
heaven
he
left
the
government
of
his
church
to
the
apostles
we
are
told
that
during
the
forty
days
between
his
rising
from
the
grave
and
his
ascension
he
gave
commandments
unto
the
apostles
and
spoke
of
the
things
pertaining
or
to
the
kingdom
of
god
i
thus
they
knew
what
they
were
to
do
when
their
master
should
be
no
longer
with
them
and
one
of
the
first
things
which
they
did
even
without
waiting
until
his
promise
of
sending
the
holy
ghost
should
be
fulfilled
was
to
choose
matthias
into
the
place
which
had
been
left
empty
by
the
fall
of
the
traitor
judas
i
after
this
we
find
that
they
appointed
other
persons
to
help
them
in
their
work
first
they
appointed
the
to
take
care
of
the
poor
and
to
assist
in
other
services
then
they
appointed
or
to
undertake
the
charge
of
congregations
afterwards
we
find
paul
sending
timothy
to
ephesus
and
titus
into
the
island
of
crete
now
called
with
power
to
ordain
elders
in
every
city
i
and
to
govern
all
the
churches
within
a
large
country
thus
then
three
kinds
or
of
ministers
of
the
church
are
mentioned
in
the
acts
and
epistles
the
are
lowest
the
or
are
next
and
above
these
there
is
a
higher
order
made
up
of
the
apostles
themselves
with
such
persons
as
timothy
and
titus
who
had
to
look
after
a
great
number
of
presbyters
and
deacons
and
were
also
the
chief
spiritual
pastors
or
of
the
people
who
were
under
the
care
of
these
presbyters
and
deacons
in
the
new
testament
the
name
of
which
means
is
sometimes
given
to
the
apostles
and
other
clergy
of
the
highest
order
and
sometimes
to
the
presbyters
but
after
a
time
it
was
given
only
to
the
highest
order
and
when
the
apostles
were
dead
the
had
the
chief
government
of
the
church
it
has
since
been
found
convenient
that
some
bishops
should
be
placed
above
others
and
should
be
called
by
higher
titles
such
as
and
but
these
all
belong
to
the
same
of
bishops
just
as
in
a
parish
although
the
rector
and
the
curate
have
different
titles
and
one
of
them
is
above
the
other
they
are
both
most
commonly
presbyters
or
as
we
now
say
and
so
they
both
belong
to
the
same
in
the
ministry
one
of
the
most
famous
among
the
early
bishops
was
ignatius
bishop
of
antioch
the
place
where
the
disciples
were
first
called
christians
xi
antioch
was
the
chief
city
of
syria
and
was
so
large
that
it
had
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
peter
himself
is
said
to
have
been
its
bishop
for
some
years
and
although
this
is
perhaps
a
mistake
it
is
worth
remembering
because
we
shall
find
that
much
was
said
about
the
bishops
of
antioch
being
peter
successors
as
well
as
the
bishops
of
rome
ignatius
had
known
john
and
was
made
bishop
of
antioch
about
thirty
years
before
the
apostle
death
he
had
governed
his
church
for
forty
years
or
more
when
the
emperor
trajan
came
to
antioch
in
the
roman
history
trajan
is
described
as
one
of
the
best
among
the
emperors
but
he
did
not
treat
the
christians
well
he
seems
never
to
have
thought
that
the
gospel
could
possibly
be
true
and
thus
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
what
the
christians
really
believed
or
did
they
were
obliged
in
those
days
to
hold
their
worship
in
secret
and
mostly
by
night
or
very
early
in
the
morning
because
it
would
not
have
been
safe
to
meet
openly
and
hence
the
heathens
who
did
not
know
what
was
done
at
their
meetings
were
tempted
to
fancy
all
manner
of
shocking
things
such
as
that
the
christians
practised
magic
that
they
worshipped
the
head
of
an
ass
that
they
offered
children
in
sacrifice
and
that
they
ate
human
flesh
it
is
not
likely
that
the
emperor
trajan
believed
such
foolish
tales
as
these
and
when
he
make
some
inquiry
about
the
ways
of
the
christians
he
heard
nothing
but
what
was
good
of
them
but
still
he
might
think
that
there
was
some
mischief
behind
and
he
might
fear
lest
the
secret
meetings
of
the
christians
should
have
something
to
do
with
plots
against
his
government
and
so
as
i
have
said
he
was
no
friend
to
them
when
trajan
came
to
antioch
ignatius
was
carried
before
him
the
emperor
asked
what
evil
spirit
possessed
him
so
that
he
not
only
broke
the
laws
by
refusing
to
serve
the
gods
of
rome
but
persuaded
others
to
do
the
same
ignatius
answered
that
he
was
not
possessed
by
any
evil
spirit
that
he
was
a
servant
of
christ
that
by
his
help
he
defeated
the
malice
of
evil
spirits
and
that
he
bore
his
god
and
saviour
within
his
heart
after
some
more
questions
and
answers
the
emperor
ordered
that
he
should
be
carried
in
chains
to
rome
and
there
should
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
when
ignatius
heard
this
terrible
sentence
he
was
so
far
from
being
frightened
that
he
burst
forth
into
thankfulness
and
rejoicing
because
he
was
allowed
to
suffer
for
his
saviour
and
for
the
deliverance
of
his
people
it
was
a
long
and
toilsome
journey
over
land
and
sea
from
antioch
to
rome
and
an
old
man
such
as
ignatius
was
ill
able
to
bear
it
especially
as
winter
was
coming
on
he
was
to
be
chained
too
and
the
soldiers
who
had
the
charge
of
him
behaved
very
rudely
and
cruelly
to
him
and
no
doubt
the
emperor
thought
that
by
sending
so
venerable
a
bishop
in
this
way
to
suffer
so
fearful
and
so
disgraceful
a
death
to
which
only
the
very
lowest
wretches
were
usually
sentenced
he
should
terrify
other
christians
into
forsaking
their
faith
but
instead
of
this
the
courage
and
the
patience
with
which
ignatius
bore
his
sufferings
gave
the
christians
fresh
spirit
to
endure
whatever
might
come
on
them
the
news
that
the
holy
bishop
of
antioch
was
to
be
carried
to
rome
soon
spread
and
at
many
places
on
the
way
the
bishops
clergy
and
people
flocked
together
that
they
might
see
him
and
pray
and
talk
with
him
and
receive
his
blessing
and
when
he
could
find
time
he
wrote
letters
to
various
churches
exhorting
them
to
stand
fast
in
the
faith
to
be
at
peace
among
themselves
to
obey
the
bishops
who
were
set
over
them
and
to
advance
in
all
holy
living
one
of
the
letters
was
written
to
the
church
at
rome
and
was
sent
on
by
some
persons
who
were
travelling
by
a
shorter
way
ignatius
begs
in
this
letter
that
the
romans
will
not
try
to
save
him
from
death
i
am
the
wheat
of
god
he
says
let
me
be
ground
by
the
teeth
of
beasts
that
i
may
be
found
the
pure
bread
of
christ
rather
do
ye
encourage
the
beasts
that
they
may
become
my
tomb
and
may
leave
nothing
of
my
body
so
that
when
dead
i
may
not
be
troublesome
to
any
one
he
even
says
that
if
the
lions
should
hang
back
he
will
himself
provoke
them
to
attack
him
it
would
not
be
right
for
ordinary
people
to
speak
in
this
way
and
the
church
has
always
disapproved
of
those
who
threw
themselves
in
the
way
of
persecution
but
a
holy
man
who
had
served
god
for
so
many
years
as
ignatius
might
well
speak
in
a
way
which
would
not
become
ordinary
christians
when
he
was
called
to
die
for
his
people
and
for
the
truth
of
christ
he
might
even
take
it
as
a
token
of
god
favour
and
might
long
for
his
deliverance
from
the
troubles
and
the
trials
of
this
world
as
paul
said
of
himself
that
he
had
a
desire
to
depart
and
to
be
with
christ
i
he
reached
rome
just
in
time
for
some
games
which
were
to
take
place
a
little
before
christmas
for
the
romans
were
cruel
enough
to
amuse
themselves
with
setting
wild
beasts
to
tear
and
devour
men
in
vast
places
called
at
their
public
games
when
the
christians
of
rome
heard
that
ignatius
was
near
the
city
great
numbers
of
them
went
out
to
meet
him
and
they
said
that
they
would
try
to
persuade
the
people
in
the
amphitheatre
to
beg
that
he
might
not
be
put
to
death
but
he
entreated
as
he
had
before
done
in
his
letter
that
they
would
do
nothing
to
hinder
him
from
glorifying
god
by
his
death
and
he
knelt
down
with
them
and
prayed
that
they
might
continue
in
faith
and
love
and
that
the
persecution
might
soon
come
to
an
end
as
it
was
the
last
day
of
the
games
and
they
were
nearly
over
he
was
then
hurried
into
the
amphitheatre
called
the
which
was
so
large
that
tens
of
thousands
of
people
might
look
on
and
in
this
place
of
which
the
ruins
are
still
to
be
seen
ignatius
was
torn
to
death
by
wild
beasts
so
that
only
a
few
of
his
larger
bones
were
left
which
the
christians
took
up
and
conveyed
to
his
own
city
of
antioch
chapter
iii
justin
martyr
although
trajan
was
no
friend
to
the
gospel
and
put
ignatius
to
death
he
made
a
law
which
must
have
been
a
great
relief
to
the
christians
until
then
they
were
liable
to
be
sought
out
and
any
one
might
inform
against
them
but
trajan
ordered
that
they
should
not
be
sought
out
although
if
they
were
discovered
and
refused
to
give
up
their
faith
they
were
to
be
punished
the
next
emperor
too
whose
name
was
hadrian
to
did
something
to
make
their
condition
better
but
it
was
still
one
of
great
hardship
and
danger
notwithstanding
the
new
laws
any
governor
of
a
country
who
disliked
the
christians
had
the
power
to
persecute
and
vex
them
cruelly
and
the
common
people
among
the
heathens
still
believed
the
horrid
stories
of
their
killing
children
and
eating
human
flesh
if
there
was
a
famine
or
a
plague
if
the
river
tiber
which
runs
through
rome
rose
above
its
usual
height
and
did
mischief
to
the
neighbouring
buildings
or
if
the
emperor
armies
were
defeated
in
war
the
blame
of
all
was
laid
on
the
christians
it
was
said
that
all
these
things
were
judgments
from
the
gods
who
were
angry
because
the
christians
were
allowed
to
live
and
then
at
the
public
games
such
as
those
at
which
ignatius
was
put
to
death
the
people
used
to
cry
out
throw
the
christians
to
the
lions
away
with
the
godless
wretches
for
as
the
christians
were
obliged
to
hold
their
worship
secretly
and
had
no
images
like
those
of
the
heathen
gods
and
did
not
offer
any
sacrifices
of
beasts
as
the
heathens
did
it
was
thought
that
they
had
no
god
at
all
since
the
heathens
could
not
raise
their
minds
to
the
thought
of
that
god
who
is
a
spirit
and
who
is
not
to
be
worshipped
under
any
bodily
shape
it
was
therefore
a
great
relief
when
the
emperor
antoninus
pius
to
who
was
a
mild
and
gentle
old
man
ordered
that
governors
and
magistrates
should
not
give
way
to
such
outcries
and
that
the
christians
should
no
longer
be
punished
for
their
religion
only
unless
they
were
found
to
have
done
wrong
in
some
other
way
there
were
now
many
learned
men
in
the
church
and
some
of
these
began
to
write
books
in
defence
of
their
faith
one
of
them
athenagoras
had
undertaken
while
he
was
a
heathen
to
show
that
the
gospel
was
all
a
deceit
but
when
he
looked
further
into
the
matter
he
found
that
it
was
very
different
from
what
he
had
fancied
and
then
he
was
converted
and
instead
of
writing
against
the
gospel
he
wrote
in
favour
of
it
another
of
these
learned
men
was
justin
who
was
born
at
samaria
and
was
trained
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
greeks
for
the
greeks
as
they
were
left
without
such
light
as
god
had
given
to
the
jews
set
themselves
to
seek
out
wisdom
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
as
they
had
no
certain
truth
from
heaven
to
guide
them
they
were
divided
into
a
number
of
different
parties
such
as
the
epicureans
and
the
stoics
who
disputed
with
paul
at
athens
xvii
these
all
called
themselves
which
means
of
and
each
kind
of
them
thought
to
be
wiser
than
all
the
rest
justin
then
having
a
strong
desire
to
know
the
truth
tried
one
kind
of
philosophy
after
another
but
could
not
find
rest
for
his
spirit
in
any
of
them
one
day
as
he
was
walking
thoughtfully
on
the
he
observed
an
old
man
of
grave
and
mild
appearance
who
was
following
him
closely
and
at
length
entered
into
talk
with
him
the
old
man
told
justin
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
search
after
wisdom
in
the
books
of
the
philosophers
and
went
on
to
speak
of
god
the
maker
of
all
things
of
the
prophecies
which
he
had
given
to
men
in
the
time
of
the
old
testament
and
how
they
had
been
fulfilled
in
the
life
and
death
of
the
blessed
jesus
thus
justin
was
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
and
the
more
he
learnt
of
it
the
more
was
he
convinced
of
its
truth
as
he
came
to
know
how
pure
and
holy
its
doctrines
and
its
rules
were
and
as
he
saw
the
love
which
christians
bore
towards
each
other
and
the
patience
and
firmness
with
which
they
endured
sufferings
and
death
for
their
sake
and
now
although
he
still
called
himself
a
philosopher
and
wore
the
long
cloak
which
was
the
common
dress
of
philosophers
the
wisdom
which
he
taught
was
not
heathen
but
christian
wisdom
he
lived
mostly
at
rome
where
scholars
flocked
to
him
in
great
numbers
and
he
wrote
books
in
defence
of
the
gospel
against
heathens
jews
and
heretics
or
false
christians
the
old
emperor
antoninus
pius
under
whom
the
christians
had
been
allowed
to
live
in
peace
and
safety
died
in
the
year
and
was
succeeded
by
marcus
aurelius
antoninus
whom
he
had
adopted
as
his
son
marcus
aurelius
was
not
only
one
of
the
best
emperors
but
in
many
ways
was
one
of
the
best
of
all
the
heathens
he
had
a
great
character
for
gentleness
kindness
and
justice
and
he
was
fond
of
books
and
liked
to
have
philosophers
and
learned
men
about
him
but
unhappily
these
people
gave
him
a
very
bad
notion
of
christianity
and
as
he
knew
no
more
of
it
than
what
they
told
him
he
took
a
strong
dislike
to
it
and
thus
although
he
was
just
and
kind
to
his
other
subjects
the
christians
suffered
more
under
his
reign
than
they
had
ever
done
before
all
the
misfortunes
that
took
place
such
as
rebellions
defeats
in
war
plague
and
scarcity
were
laid
to
the
blame
of
the
christians
and
the
emperor
himself
seems
to
have
thought
that
they
were
in
fault
as
he
made
some
new
laws
against
them
now
the
success
which
justin
had
as
a
teacher
at
rome
had
long
raised
the
envy
and
malice
of
the
heathen
philosophers
and
when
these
new
laws
against
the
christians
came
out
one
crescens
a
philosopher
of
the
kind
called
or
on
account
of
their
snarling
currish
ways
contrived
that
justin
should
be
carried
before
a
judge
on
the
charge
of
being
a
christian
the
judge
questioned
him
as
to
his
belief
and
as
to
the
meetings
of
the
christians
to
which
justin
answered
that
he
believed
in
one
god
and
in
the
saviour
christ
the
son
of
god
but
he
refused
to
say
anything
which
could
betray
his
brethren
to
the
persecutors
the
judge
then
threatened
him
with
scourging
and
death
but
justin
replied
that
the
sufferings
of
this
world
were
nothing
to
the
glory
which
christ
had
promised
to
his
people
in
the
world
to
come
then
he
and
the
others
who
had
been
brought
up
for
trial
with
him
were
asked
whether
they
would
offer
sacrifice
to
the
gods
of
the
heathen
and
as
they
refused
to
do
this
and
to
forsake
their
faith
they
were
all
beheaded
and
on
account
of
the
death
which
he
thus
suffered
for
the
gospel
justin
has
ever
since
been
especially
styled
the
martyr
chapter
iv
polycarp
about
the
same
time
with
justin
the
martyr
polycarp
bishop
of
smyrna
was
put
to
death
he
was
a
very
old
man
for
it
was
almost
ninety
years
since
he
had
been
converted
from
heathenism
he
had
known
john
and
is
supposed
to
have
been
made
bishop
of
smyrna
by
that
apostle
himself
and
he
had
been
a
friend
of
ignatius
who
as
we
have
seen
suffered
martyrdom
fifty
years
before
from
all
these
things
and
from
his
wise
and
holy
character
he
was
looked
up
to
as
a
father
by
all
the
churches
and
his
mild
advice
had
sometimes
put
an
end
to
differences
of
opinion
which
but
for
him
might
have
turned
into
lasting
quarrels
when
the
persecution
reached
smyrna
in
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
a
number
of
christians
suffered
with
great
constancy
and
the
heathen
multitude
being
provoked
at
their
refusal
to
give
up
their
faith
cried
out
for
the
death
of
polycarp
the
aged
bishop
although
he
was
ready
to
die
for
his
saviour
remembered
that
it
was
not
right
to
throw
himself
in
the
way
of
danger
so
he
left
the
city
and
went
first
to
one
village
in
the
neighbourhood
and
then
to
another
but
he
was
discovered
in
his
and
when
he
saw
the
soldiers
who
were
come
to
seize
him
he
calmly
said
god
will
be
done
he
desired
that
some
food
should
be
given
to
them
and
while
they
were
eating
he
spent
the
time
in
prayer
he
was
then
set
on
an
ass
and
led
towards
smyrna
and
when
he
was
near
the
town
one
of
the
heathen
magistrates
came
by
in
his
chariot
and
took
him
up
into
it
the
magistrate
tried
to
persuade
polycarp
to
sacrifice
to
the
gods
but
finding
that
he
could
make
nothing
of
him
he
pushed
him
out
of
the
chariot
so
roughly
that
the
old
man
fell
and
broke
his
leg
but
polycarp
bore
the
pain
without
showing
how
much
he
was
hurt
and
the
soldiers
led
him
into
the
amphitheatre
where
great
numbers
of
people
were
gathered
together
when
all
these
saw
him
they
set
up
loud
cries
of
rage
and
savage
delight
but
polycarp
thought
as
he
entered
the
place
that
he
heard
a
voice
saying
to
him
be
strong
and
play
the
man
and
he
did
not
heed
all
the
shouting
of
the
crowd
the
governor
desired
him
to
deny
christ
and
said
that
if
he
would
his
life
should
be
spared
but
the
faithful
bishop
answered
fourscore
and
six
years
have
i
served
christ
and
he
hath
never
done
me
wrong
how
then
can
i
now
blaspheme
my
king
and
saviour
the
governor
again
and
again
urged
him
as
if
in
a
friendly
way
to
sacrifice
but
polycarp
stedfastly
refused
he
next
threatened
to
let
wild
beasts
loose
on
him
and
as
polycarp
still
showed
no
fear
he
said
that
he
would
burn
him
alive
you
threaten
me
said
the
bishop
with
a
fire
which
lasts
but
a
short
time
but
you
know
not
of
that
eternal
fire
which
is
prepared
for
the
wicked
a
stake
was
then
set
up
and
a
pile
of
wood
was
collected
around
it
polycarp
walked
to
the
place
with
a
calm
and
cheerful
look
and
as
the
executioners
were
going
to
fasten
him
to
the
stake
with
iron
cramps
he
begged
them
to
spare
themselves
the
trouble
he
who
gives
me
the
strength
to
bear
the
flames
he
said
will
enable
me
to
remain
steady
he
was
therefore
only
tied
to
the
stake
with
cords
and
as
he
stood
thus
bound
he
uttered
a
thanksgiving
for
being
allowed
to
suffer
after
the
pattern
of
his
lord
and
saviour
when
his
prayer
was
ended
the
wood
was
set
on
fire
but
we
are
told
that
the
flames
swept
round
him
looking
like
the
sail
of
a
ship
swollen
by
the
wind
while
he
remained
unhurt
in
the
midst
of
them
one
of
the
executioners
seeing
this
plunged
a
sword
into
the
martyr
breast
and
the
blood
rushed
forth
in
such
a
stream
that
it
put
out
the
fire
but
the
persecutors
who
were
resolved
that
the
christians
should
not
have
their
bishop
body
lighted
the
wood
again
and
burnt
the
corpse
so
that
only
a
few
of
the
bones
remained
and
these
the
christians
gathered
out
and
gave
them
an
honourable
burial
it
was
on
easter
eve
that
polycarp
suffered
in
the
year
of
our
lord
chapter
the
martyrs
of
lyons
and
vienne
many
other
martyrs
suffered
in
various
parts
of
the
empire
under
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
among
the
most
famous
of
these
are
the
martyrs
of
lyons
and
vienne
in
the
south
of
france
or
as
it
was
then
called
where
a
company
of
missionaries
from
asia
minor
had
settled
with
a
bishop
named
pothinus
at
their
head
the
persecution
at
lyons
and
vienne
was
begun
by
the
mob
of
those
towns
who
insulted
the
christians
in
the
streets
broke
into
their
houses
and
committed
other
such
outrages
against
them
then
a
great
number
of
christians
were
seized
and
imprisoned
in
horrid
dungeons
where
many
died
from
want
of
food
or
from
the
bad
and
unwholesome
air
the
bishop
pothinus
who
was
ninety
years
of
age
and
had
long
been
very
ill
was
carried
before
the
governor
and
was
asked
who
is
the
god
of
christians
pothinus
saw
that
the
governor
did
not
put
this
question
from
any
good
feeling
so
he
answered
if
thou
be
worthy
thou
shalt
know
the
bishop
old
and
feeble
as
he
was
was
then
dragged
about
by
soldiers
and
such
of
the
mob
as
could
reach
him
gave
him
blows
and
kicks
while
others
who
were
further
off
threw
anything
which
came
to
hand
at
him
and
after
this
cruel
usage
he
was
put
into
prison
where
he
died
within
two
days
the
other
prisoners
were
tortured
for
six
days
together
in
a
variety
of
horrible
ways
their
limbs
were
stretched
on
the
rack
they
were
cruelly
scourged
some
had
hot
plates
of
iron
applied
to
them
and
some
were
made
to
sit
in
a
iron
chair
the
firmness
with
which
they
bore
these
dreadful
trials
gave
courage
to
some
of
their
brethren
who
at
first
had
agreed
to
sacrifice
so
that
these
now
again
declared
themselves
christians
and
joined
the
others
in
suffering
as
all
the
tortures
were
of
no
effect
the
prisoners
were
at
length
put
to
death
some
were
thrown
to
wild
beasts
but
those
who
were
citizens
of
rome
were
beheaded
for
it
was
not
lawful
to
give
a
roman
citizen
up
to
wild
beasts
just
as
we
know
from
paul
case
at
philippi
that
it
was
not
lawful
to
scourge
a
citizen
xvi
among
the
martyrs
was
a
boy
from
asia
only
fifteen
years
old
who
was
taken
every
day
to
see
the
tortures
of
the
rest
in
the
hope
that
he
might
be
frightened
into
denying
his
saviour
but
he
was
not
shaken
by
the
terrible
sights
and
for
his
constancy
he
was
cruelly
put
to
death
on
the
last
day
the
greatest
cruelties
of
all
however
were
borne
by
a
young
woman
named
blandina
she
was
slave
to
a
christian
lady
and
although
the
christians
regarded
their
slaves
with
a
kindness
very
unlike
the
usual
feeling
of
heathen
masters
towards
them
this
lady
seems
yet
to
have
thought
that
a
slave
was
not
likely
to
endure
tortures
so
courageously
as
a
free
person
and
she
was
the
more
afraid
because
blandina
was
not
strong
in
body
but
the
poor
slave
faith
was
not
to
be
overcome
day
after
day
she
bravely
bore
every
cruelty
that
the
persecutors
could
think
of
and
all
that
they
could
wring
out
from
her
was
i
am
a
christian
and
nothing
wrong
is
done
among
us
the
heathen
were
not
content
with
putting
the
martyrs
to
death
with
tortures
or
allowing
them
to
die
in
prison
they
cast
their
dead
bodies
to
the
dogs
and
caused
them
to
be
watched
day
and
night
lest
the
other
christians
should
give
them
burial
and
after
this
they
burnt
the
bones
and
threw
the
ashes
of
them
into
the
river
rhone
by
way
of
mocking
at
the
notion
of
a
resurrection
for
as
paul
had
found
at
athens
xvii
and
elsewhere
there
was
no
part
of
the
gospel
which
the
heathen
in
general
thought
so
hard
to
believe
as
the
doctrine
that
that
which
is
sown
in
corruption
shall
hereafter
be
raised
in
incorruption
that
that
which
is
sown
a
natural
body
will
one
day
be
raised
a
spiritual
body
xv
chapter
vi
tertullian
perpetua
and
her
companions
the
emperor
marcus
aurelius
died
in
and
the
church
was
little
troubled
by
persecution
for
the
following
twenty
years
about
this
time
a
false
teacher
named
montanus
made
much
noise
in
the
world
he
was
born
in
phrygia
and
seems
to
have
been
crazed
in
his
mind
he
used
to
fall
into
fits
and
while
in
them
he
uttered
ravings
which
were
taken
for
prophecies
or
messages
from
heaven
and
some
women
who
followed
him
also
pretended
to
be
prophetesses
these
people
taught
a
very
strict
way
of
living
and
thus
many
persons
who
wished
to
lead
holy
lives
were
deceived
into
running
after
them
one
of
these
was
tertullian
of
carthage
in
africa
a
very
clever
and
learned
man
who
had
been
converted
from
heathenism
and
had
written
some
books
in
defence
of
the
gospel
but
he
was
of
a
proud
and
impatient
temper
and
did
not
rightly
consider
how
our
lord
himself
had
said
that
there
would
always
be
a
mixture
of
evil
with
the
good
in
his
church
on
earth
xiii
and
hence
when
montanus
pretended
to
set
up
a
new
church
in
which
there
should
be
none
but
good
and
holy
people
tertullian
fell
into
the
snare
and
left
the
true
church
to
join
the
montanists
as
the
followers
of
montanus
were
called
from
that
time
he
wrote
very
bitterly
against
the
church
but
he
still
continued
to
defend
the
gospel
in
his
books
against
jews
and
heathens
and
all
kinds
of
false
teachers
except
montanus
and
when
he
was
dead
his
good
deeds
were
remembered
more
than
his
fall
so
that
with
all
his
faults
his
name
has
always
been
held
in
respect
after
more
than
twenty
years
of
peace
there
were
cruel
persecutions
in
some
places
under
the
reign
of
severus
the
most
famous
of
the
martyrs
who
then
suffered
were
perpetua
and
her
companions
who
belonged
to
the
same
country
with
tertullian
and
perhaps
to
his
own
city
carthage
perpetua
was
a
young
married
lady
and
had
a
little
baby
only
a
few
weeks
old
her
father
was
a
heathen
but
she
herself
had
been
converted
and
was
a
which
was
the
name
given
to
converts
who
had
not
yet
been
baptized
but
where
in
a
course
of
or
training
for
baptism
when
perpetua
had
been
put
into
prison
her
father
went
to
see
her
in
the
hope
that
he
might
persuade
her
to
give
up
her
faith
father
she
said
you
see
this
vessel
standing
here
can
you
call
it
by
any
other
than
its
right
name
he
answered
no
neither
said
perpetua
can
i
call
myself
anything
else
than
what
i
am
a
christian
on
hearing
this
her
father
flew
at
her
in
such
anger
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
tear
out
her
eyes
but
she
stood
so
quietly
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
hurt
her
and
he
went
away
and
did
not
come
again
for
some
time
in
the
meanwhile
perpetua
and
some
of
her
companions
were
baptized
and
at
her
baptism
she
prayed
for
grace
to
bear
whatever
sufferings
might
be
in
store
for
her
the
prison
in
which
she
and
the
others
were
shut
up
was
a
horrible
dungeon
where
perpetua
suffered
much
from
the
darkness
the
crowded
state
of
the
place
the
heat
and
closeness
of
the
air
and
the
rude
behaviour
of
the
guards
but
most
of
all
she
was
distressed
about
her
poor
little
child
who
was
separated
from
her
and
was
pining
away
some
kind
christians
however
gave
money
to
the
keepers
of
the
prison
and
got
leave
for
perpetua
and
her
friends
to
spend
some
hours
of
the
day
in
a
lighter
part
of
the
building
where
her
child
was
brought
to
see
her
and
after
a
while
she
took
him
to
be
always
with
her
and
then
she
felt
as
cheerful
as
if
she
had
been
in
a
palace
the
martyrs
were
comforted
by
dreams
which
served
to
give
them
courage
and
strength
to
bear
their
sufferings
by
showing
them
visions
of
blessedness
which
was
to
follow
when
the
day
was
fixed
for
their
trial
perpetua
father
went
again
to
see
her
he
begged
her
to
take
pity
on
his
old
age
to
remember
all
his
kindness
to
her
and
how
he
had
loved
her
best
of
all
his
children
he
implored
her
to
think
of
her
mother
and
her
brothers
and
of
the
disgrace
which
would
fall
on
all
the
family
if
she
were
to
be
put
to
death
as
an
the
poor
old
man
shed
a
flood
of
tears
he
humbled
himself
before
her
kissing
her
hands
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
and
calling
her
instead
of
but
although
perpetua
was
grieved
to
the
heart
she
could
only
say
god
pleasure
will
be
done
on
us
we
are
not
in
our
own
power
but
in
his
one
day
as
the
prisoners
were
at
dinner
they
were
suddenly
hurried
off
to
their
trial
the
where
the
judge
was
sitting
was
crowded
with
people
and
when
perpetua
was
brought
forward
her
father
crept
as
close
to
her
as
he
could
holding
out
her
child
and
said
take
pity
on
your
infant
the
judge
himself
entreated
her
to
pity
the
little
one
and
the
old
man
and
to
sacrifice
but
painful
as
the
trial
was
she
steadily
declared
that
she
was
a
christian
and
that
she
could
not
worship
false
gods
at
these
words
her
father
burst
out
into
such
loud
cries
that
the
judge
ordered
him
to
be
put
down
from
the
place
where
he
was
standing
and
to
be
beaten
with
rods
perhaps
the
judge
did
not
mean
so
much
to
punish
the
old
man
for
being
noisy
as
to
try
whether
the
sight
of
his
suffering
might
not
move
his
daughter
but
although
perpetua
felt
every
blow
as
if
it
had
been
laid
upon
herself
she
knew
that
she
must
not
give
way
she
was
condemned
with
her
companions
to
be
exposed
to
wild
beasts
and
after
she
had
been
taken
back
to
prison
her
father
visited
her
once
more
he
seemed
as
if
beside
himself
with
grief
he
tore
his
white
beard
he
cursed
his
old
age
and
spoke
in
a
way
that
might
have
moved
a
heart
of
stone
but
still
perpetua
could
only
be
sorry
for
him
she
could
not
give
up
her
saviour
the
prisoners
were
kept
for
some
time
after
their
condemnation
that
they
might
be
put
to
death
at
some
great
games
which
were
to
be
held
on
the
birthday
of
one
of
the
emperor
sons
and
during
this
confinement
their
behaviour
had
a
great
effect
on
many
who
saw
it
the
gaoler
himself
was
converted
by
it
and
so
were
others
who
had
gone
to
gaze
at
them
at
length
the
appointed
day
came
and
the
martyrs
were
led
into
the
amphitheatre
the
men
were
torn
by
leopards
and
bears
perpetua
and
a
young
woman
named
felicitas
who
had
been
a
slave
were
put
into
nets
and
thrown
before
a
furious
cow
who
tossed
them
and
gored
them
cruelly
and
when
this
was
over
perpetua
seemed
as
if
she
had
not
felt
it
but
were
awaking
from
a
trance
and
she
asked
when
the
cow
was
to
come
she
then
helped
felicitas
to
rise
from
the
ground
and
spoke
words
of
comfort
and
encouragement
to
others
when
the
people
in
the
amphitheatre
had
seen
as
much
as
they
wished
of
the
wild
beasts
they
called
out
that
the
prisoners
should
be
killed
perpetua
and
the
rest
then
took
leave
of
each
other
and
walked
with
cheerful
looks
and
firm
steps
into
the
middle
of
the
amphitheatre
where
men
with
swords
fell
on
them
and
dispatched
them
the
executioner
who
was
to
kill
perpetua
was
a
youth
and
was
so
nervous
that
he
stabbed
her
in
a
place
where
the
hurt
was
not
deadly
but
she
herself
took
hold
of
his
sword
and
showed
him
where
to
give
her
the
chapter
vii
origen
the
same
persecution
in
which
perpetua
and
her
companions
suffered
at
carthage
raged
also
at
alexandria
in
egypt
where
a
learned
man
named
leonides
was
one
of
the
martyrs
leonides
had
a
son
named
origen
whom
he
had
brought
up
very
carefully
and
had
taught
to
get
some
part
of
the
bible
by
heart
every
day
and
origen
was
very
eager
to
learn
and
was
so
good
and
so
clever
that
his
father
was
afraid
to
show
how
fond
and
how
proud
he
was
of
him
lest
the
boy
should
become
forward
and
conceited
so
when
origen
asked
questions
of
a
kind
which
few
boys
would
have
thought
of
asking
his
father
used
to
check
him
but
when
he
was
asleep
leonides
would
steal
to
his
bedside
and
kiss
him
thanking
god
for
having
given
him
such
a
child
and
praying
that
origen
might
always
be
kept
in
the
right
way
when
the
persecution
began
origen
who
was
then
about
seventeen
years
old
wished
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
die
for
his
faith
but
his
mother
hid
his
clothes
and
so
obliged
him
to
stay
at
home
and
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
write
to
his
father
in
prison
and
to
beg
that
he
would
not
fear
lest
the
widow
and
orphans
should
be
left
destitute
but
would
be
steadfast
in
his
faith
and
would
trust
in
god
to
provide
for
their
relief
the
persecutors
were
not
content
with
killing
leonides
but
seized
on
all
his
property
so
that
the
widow
was
left
in
great
distress
with
seven
children
of
whom
origen
was
the
eldest
a
christian
lady
kindly
took
origen
into
her
house
and
after
a
time
young
as
he
was
he
was
made
master
of
the
a
sort
of
college
where
the
young
christians
of
alexandria
were
instructed
in
religion
and
learning
the
persecution
had
slackened
for
a
while
but
it
began
again
and
some
of
origen
pupils
were
martyred
he
went
with
them
to
their
trial
and
stood
by
them
in
their
sufferings
but
although
he
was
by
the
mob
of
alexandria
he
was
himself
allowed
to
go
free
origen
had
read
in
the
gospel
freely
ye
have
received
freely
give
x
and
he
thought
that
therefore
he
ought
to
teach
for
nothing
in
order
therefore
that
he
might
be
able
to
do
this
he
sold
a
quantity
of
books
which
he
had
written
out
and
lived
for
a
long
time
on
the
price
of
them
allowing
himself
only
about
fivepence
a
day
his
food
was
of
the
poorest
kind
he
had
but
one
coat
through
which
he
felt
the
cold
of
winter
severely
he
sat
up
the
greater
part
of
the
night
and
then
lay
down
on
the
bare
floor
when
he
grew
older
he
came
to
understand
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
some
of
his
notions
as
to
these
things
and
to
regret
that
by
treating
himself
so
hardly
he
had
hurt
his
health
beyond
repair
but
still
mistaken
as
he
was
we
must
honour
him
for
going
through
so
bravely
with
what
he
took
to
be
his
duty
he
soon
grew
so
famous
as
a
teacher
that
even
jews
heathens
and
heretics
went
to
hear
him
and
many
of
them
were
so
led
on
by
him
that
they
were
converted
to
the
gospel
he
travelled
a
great
deal
some
of
his
journeys
were
taken
because
he
had
been
invited
into
foreign
countries
that
he
might
teach
the
gospel
to
people
who
were
desirous
of
instruction
in
it
or
that
he
might
settle
disputes
about
religion
and
he
was
invited
to
go
on
a
visit
to
the
mother
of
the
emperor
alexander
severus
who
was
himself
friendly
to
christianity
although
not
a
christian
origen
too
wrote
a
great
number
of
books
in
explanation
of
the
bible
and
on
other
religious
subjects
and
he
worked
for
no
less
than
years
at
a
great
book
called
the
which
was
meant
to
show
how
the
old
testament
ought
to
be
read
in
hebrew
and
in
greek
but
although
he
was
a
very
good
as
well
as
a
very
learned
man
origen
fell
into
some
strange
opinions
from
wishing
to
clear
away
some
of
those
difficulties
which
as
paul
says
made
the
gospel
seem
foolishness
to
the
heathen
philosophers
i
besides
this
demetrius
the
bishop
of
alexandria
although
he
had
been
his
friend
had
some
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
ordain
him
to
be
one
of
the
clergy
and
when
origen
had
been
ordained
a
presbyter
or
priest
in
the
holy
land
where
he
was
on
a
visit
demetrius
was
very
angry
he
said
that
no
man
ought
to
be
ordained
in
any
church
but
that
of
his
own
home
and
he
brought
up
stories
about
some
rash
things
which
origen
had
done
in
his
youth
and
questions
about
the
strange
doctrines
which
he
held
origen
finding
that
he
could
not
hope
for
peace
at
alexandria
went
back
to
his
friend
the
bishop
of
cæsarea
by
whom
he
had
been
ordained
and
he
spent
many
years
at
cæsarea
where
he
was
more
sought
after
as
a
teacher
than
ever
at
one
time
he
was
driven
into
cappadocia
by
the
persecution
of
a
savage
emperor
named
maximin
who
had
murdered
the
gentle
alexander
severus
but
he
returned
to
cæsarea
and
lived
there
until
another
persecution
began
under
the
emperor
decius
this
was
by
far
the
worst
persecution
that
had
yet
been
known
it
was
the
first
which
was
carried
on
throughout
the
whole
empire
and
no
regard
was
now
paid
to
the
old
laws
which
trajan
and
other
emperors
had
made
for
the
protection
of
the
christians
they
were
sought
out
and
were
made
to
appear
in
the
of
every
town
where
they
were
required
by
the
magistrates
to
sacrifice
and
if
they
refused
were
sentenced
to
severe
punishment
the
emperor
wished
most
to
get
at
the
bishops
and
clergy
for
he
thought
that
if
the
teachers
were
put
out
of
the
way
the
people
would
soon
give
up
the
gospel
although
many
martyrs
were
put
to
death
at
this
time
the
persecutors
did
not
so
much
wish
to
kill
the
christians
as
to
make
them
disown
their
religion
and
in
the
hope
of
this
many
of
them
were
starved
and
tortured
and
sent
into
banishment
in
strange
countries
among
wild
people
who
had
never
before
heard
of
christ
but
here
the
emperor
plans
were
notably
disappointed
for
the
banished
bishops
and
clergy
had
thus
an
opportunity
of
making
the
gospel
known
to
those
poor
wild
tribes
whom
it
might
not
have
reached
for
a
long
time
if
the
church
had
been
left
in
quiet
we
shall
hear
more
about
the
persecution
in
the
next
chapter
here
i
shall
only
say
that
origen
was
imprisoned
and
cruelly
tortured
he
was
by
this
time
nearly
seventy
years
old
and
was
weak
in
body
from
the
labours
which
he
had
gone
through
in
study
and
from
having
hurt
his
health
by
hard
and
scanty
living
in
his
youth
so
that
he
was
ill
able
to
bear
the
pains
of
the
torture
and
although
he
did
not
die
under
it
he
died
of
its
effects
soon
after
decius
himself
was
killed
in
battle
and
his
persecution
came
to
an
end
and
when
it
was
over
the
faithful
understood
that
it
had
been
of
great
use
not
only
by
helping
to
spread
the
gospel
in
the
way
which
has
been
mentioned
but
in
purifying
the
church
and
in
rousing
christians
from
the
carelessness
into
which
too
many
of
them
had
fallen
during
the
long
time
of
ease
and
quiet
which
they
had
before
enjoyed
for
the
trials
which
god
sends
on
his
people
in
this
world
are
like
the
chastisements
of
a
loving
father
and
if
we
accept
them
rightly
they
will
all
be
found
to
turn
out
to
our
good
chapter
viii
cyprian
part
about
the
same
time
with
origen
lived
st
cyprian
bishop
of
carthage
he
was
born
about
the
year
and
had
been
long
famous
as
a
professor
of
heathen
learning
when
he
was
converted
at
the
age
of
he
then
gave
up
his
calling
as
a
teacher
and
like
the
first
christians
at
jerusalem
iv
he
sold
a
fine
house
and
gardens
which
he
had
near
the
town
and
gave
the
price
with
a
large
part
of
his
other
money
to
the
poor
he
became
one
of
the
clergy
of
carthage
and
when
the
bishop
died
about
three
years
after
cyprian
was
so
much
loved
and
respected
that
he
was
chosen
in
his
place
cyprian
tried
with
all
his
power
to
do
the
duties
of
a
good
bishop
and
to
get
rid
of
many
wrong
things
which
had
grown
upon
his
church
during
the
long
peace
which
it
had
enjoyed
but
about
two
years
after
he
was
made
bishop
the
persecution
under
decius
broke
out
when
as
was
said
in
the
last
chapter
the
persecutors
tried
especially
to
strike
at
the
bishops
and
clergy
and
to
force
them
to
deny
their
faith
now
cyprian
would
have
been
ready
and
glad
to
die
if
it
would
have
served
the
good
of
his
people
but
he
remembered
how
our
lord
had
said
when
they
persecute
you
in
this
city
flee
ye
into
another
x
and
how
he
himself
withdrew
from
the
rage
of
his
enemies
because
his
hour
was
not
yet
come
viii
xi
and
it
seemed
to
the
good
bishop
that
for
the
present
it
would
be
best
to
go
out
of
the
way
of
his
persecutors
but
he
kept
a
constant
watch
over
all
that
was
done
in
his
church
and
he
often
wrote
to
his
clergy
and
people
from
the
place
where
he
was
hidden
but
in
the
meanwhile
things
went
on
badly
at
carthage
many
had
called
themselves
christians
in
the
late
quiet
times
who
would
not
have
done
so
if
there
had
been
any
danger
about
it
and
now
when
the
danger
came
numbers
of
them
ran
into
the
at
carthage
and
seemed
quite
eager
to
offer
sacrifice
to
the
gods
of
the
heathen
others
who
did
not
sacrifice
bribed
some
officers
of
the
government
to
give
them
tickets
certifying
that
they
sacrificed
and
yet
they
contrived
to
persuade
themselves
that
they
had
done
nothing
wrong
by
their
cowardice
and
deceit
there
were
too
some
mischievous
men
among
the
clergy
who
had
not
wished
cyprian
to
be
bishop
and
had
borne
him
a
grudge
ever
since
he
was
chosen
and
now
these
clergymen
set
on
the
people
who
had
or
in
the
persecution
to
demand
that
they
should
be
taken
back
into
the
church
and
to
say
that
some
martyrs
had
given
them
letters
which
entitled
them
to
be
admitted
at
once
in
those
days
it
was
usual
when
any
christian
was
known
to
have
been
guilty
of
a
heavy
sin
that
as
is
said
in
our
commination
service
he
should
be
put
to
open
by
the
church
that
is
that
he
should
be
required
to
show
his
repentance
publicly
persons
who
were
in
this
state
were
not
allowed
to
receive
the
holy
sacrament
of
the
supper
as
all
other
christians
then
did
very
often
the
worst
sinners
were
obliged
to
stand
outside
the
where
they
begged
those
who
were
going
in
to
pray
that
their
sins
might
be
forgiven
and
those
of
the
penitents
who
were
let
into
the
church
had
places
in
it
separate
from
other
christians
sometimes
penance
lasted
for
years
and
always
until
the
penitents
had
done
enough
to
prove
that
they
were
truly
grieved
for
their
sins
so
that
the
clergy
might
hope
that
they
were
received
to
god
mercy
for
their
redeemer
sake
but
as
it
was
counted
a
great
and
glorious
thing
to
die
for
the
truth
of
christ
and
martyrs
were
highly
honoured
in
the
church
penitents
had
been
in
the
habit
of
going
to
them
while
they
were
in
prison
awaiting
death
and
of
entreating
the
martyrs
to
plead
with
the
church
for
the
shortening
of
the
appointed
penance
and
it
had
been
usual
out
of
regard
for
the
holy
martyrs
to
forgive
those
to
whom
they
had
given
letters
desiring
that
the
penitents
might
be
gently
treated
but
now
these
people
at
carthage
instead
of
showing
themselves
humble
as
true
penitents
would
have
been
came
forward
in
an
insolent
manner
as
if
they
had
a
right
to
claim
that
they
might
be
restored
to
the
church
and
the
letters
or
rather
what
they
martyrs
letters
were
used
in
a
way
very
different
from
anything
that
had
ever
been
allowed
cyprian
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
them
but
he
dealt
wisely
in
the
matter
and
at
length
had
the
comfort
of
settling
it
but
as
people
are
always
ready
to
find
fault
in
one
way
or
another
some
blamed
him
for
being
too
strict
with
the
and
others
for
being
too
easy
and
each
of
these
parties
went
so
far
as
to
set
up
a
bishop
of
its
own
against
him
after
a
time
however
he
got
the
better
of
these
enemies
although
the
straiter
sect
who
were
called
after
novatian
a
presbyter
of
rome
lasted
for
three
hundred
years
or
more
part
ii
shortly
after
the
end
of
the
persecution
a
terrible
plague
passed
through
the
empire
and
carried
off
vast
numbers
of
people
many
of
the
heathen
thought
that
the
plague
was
sent
by
their
gods
to
punish
them
for
allowing
the
christians
to
live
and
the
mobs
of
towns
broke
out
against
the
christians
killing
some
of
them
and
hurting
them
in
other
ways
but
instead
of
returning
evil
for
evil
the
christians
showed
what
a
spirit
of
love
they
had
learnt
from
their
lord
and
master
and
there
was
no
place
where
this
was
more
remarkably
shown
than
at
carthage
the
heathen
there
were
so
terrified
by
the
plague
that
they
seemed
to
have
lost
all
natural
feeling
and
almost
to
be
out
of
their
senses
when
their
friends
fell
sick
they
left
them
to
die
without
any
care
when
they
were
dead
they
cast
out
their
bodies
into
the
street
and
the
corpses
which
lay
about
unburied
were
not
only
shocking
to
look
at
but
made
the
air
unwholesome
so
that
there
was
much
more
danger
of
the
plague
than
before
but
while
the
heathen
were
behaving
in
this
way
and
each
of
them
thought
only
of
himself
cyprian
called
the
christians
of
carthage
together
and
told
them
that
were
bound
to
do
very
differently
it
would
be
no
wonder
he
said
if
we
were
to
attend
to
our
own
friends
but
christ
our
lord
charges
us
to
do
good
to
heathens
and
publicans
also
and
to
love
our
enemies
he
prayed
for
them
that
persecuted
him
and
if
we
are
his
disciples
we
ought
to
do
so
too
and
then
the
good
bishop
went
on
to
tell
his
people
what
part
each
of
them
should
take
in
the
charitable
work
those
who
had
money
were
to
give
it
and
were
to
do
such
acts
of
kindness
as
they
could
besides
the
poor
who
had
no
silver
or
gold
to
spare
were
to
give
their
labour
in
a
spirit
of
love
so
all
classes
set
to
their
tasks
gladly
and
they
nursed
the
sick
and
buried
the
dead
without
asking
whether
they
were
christian
or
heathens
when
the
heathens
saw
these
acts
of
love
many
of
them
were
brought
to
wonder
what
it
could
be
that
made
the
christians
do
them
and
how
they
came
to
be
so
kind
to
poor
and
old
people
to
widows
and
orphans
and
slaves
and
how
it
was
that
they
were
always
ready
to
raise
money
for
buying
the
freedom
of
captives
or
for
helping
their
brethren
who
were
in
any
kind
of
trouble
and
from
wondering
and
asking
what
it
was
that
led
christians
to
do
such
things
which
they
themselves
would
never
have
thought
of
doing
many
of
the
heathen
were
brought
to
see
that
the
gospel
was
the
true
religion
and
they
forsook
their
idols
to
follow
christ
after
this
cyprian
had
a
disagreement
with
stephen
bishop
of
rome
rome
was
the
greatest
city
in
the
whole
world
and
the
capital
of
the
empire
there
were
many
christians
there
even
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
and
as
years
went
on
the
church
of
rome
grew
more
and
more
so
that
it
was
the
greatest
and
richest
and
most
important
church
of
all
now
the
bishops
who
were
at
the
head
of
this
great
church
were
naturally
reckoned
the
foremost
of
all
bishops
and
had
more
power
than
any
other
so
that
if
a
proud
man
got
the
bishopric
of
rome
it
was
too
likely
that
he
might
try
to
set
himself
up
above
his
brethren
and
to
lay
down
the
law
to
them
stephen
was
unhappily
a
man
of
this
kind
and
he
gave
way
to
the
temptation
and
tried
to
lord
it
over
other
bishops
and
their
churches
but
cyprian
held
out
against
him
and
made
him
understand
that
the
bishop
of
rome
had
no
right
to
give
laws
to
other
bishops
or
to
meddle
with
the
churches
of
other
countries
he
showed
that
although
peter
from
whom
stephen
pretended
that
the
bishops
of
rome
had
received
power
over
others
was
the
first
of
the
apostles
he
was
not
of
a
higher
class
or
order
than
the
rest
and
therefore
that
although
the
roman
bishops
stood
first
the
other
bishops
were
their
equals
and
had
received
an
equal
share
in
the
christian
ministry
so
stephen
was
not
able
to
get
the
power
which
he
wished
for
over
other
churches
and
after
his
death
carthage
and
rome
were
at
peace
again
part
iii
about
six
years
after
the
death
of
the
emperor
decius
a
fresh
persecution
arose
under
another
emperor
named
valerian
he
began
by
ordering
that
the
christians
should
not
be
allowed
to
meet
for
worship
and
that
the
bishops
and
clergy
should
be
separated
from
their
flocks
cyprian
was
carried
before
the
governor
of
africa
and
on
being
questioned
by
him
he
said
i
am
a
christian
and
a
bishop
i
know
no
other
gods
but
the
one
true
god
who
made
heaven
and
earth
the
sea
and
all
that
is
in
them
it
is
this
god
that
we
christians
serve
to
him
we
pray
day
and
night
for
ourselves
and
all
mankind
and
for
the
welfare
of
the
emperors
themselves
the
governor
asked
him
about
his
clergy
our
laws
said
cyprian
forbid
them
to
throw
themselves
in
your
way
and
i
may
not
inform
against
them
but
if
they
be
sought
after
they
will
be
found
each
at
his
post
the
governor
said
that
no
christians
must
meet
for
worship
under
pain
of
death
and
he
sentenced
cyprian
to
be
banished
to
a
place
called
curubis
about
forty
miles
from
carthage
it
was
a
pleasant
abode
and
cyprian
lived
there
a
year
during
which
time
he
was
often
visited
by
his
friends
and
wrote
many
letters
of
advice
and
comfort
to
his
brethren
and
as
many
of
these
were
worse
treated
than
himself
by
being
carried
off
into
savage
places
or
set
to
work
underground
in
mines
he
did
all
that
he
could
to
relieve
their
distress
by
sending
them
money
and
other
presents
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
bishop
was
carried
back
to
carthage
where
a
new
governor
had
just
arrived
the
emperor
had
found
that
his
first
law
against
the
christians
was
of
little
use
so
he
now
made
a
second
law
which
was
much
more
severe
it
ordered
that
bishops
and
clergy
should
be
put
to
death
that
such
christians
as
were
persons
of
worldly
rank
should
lose
all
that
they
had
and
be
banished
or
killed
but
it
said
nothing
about
the
poorer
christians
who
do
not
seem
to
have
been
in
any
danger
cyprian
thought
that
his
time
was
now
come
and
when
his
friends
entreated
him
to
save
himself
by
flight
he
refused
he
was
carried
off
to
the
governor
country
house
about
six
miles
from
carthage
where
he
was
treated
with
much
respect
and
was
allowed
to
have
some
friends
with
him
at
supper
great
numbers
of
his
people
on
hearing
that
he
was
seized
went
from
carthage
to
the
place
where
he
was
and
watched
all
night
outside
the
house
in
fear
lest
their
bishop
should
be
put
to
death
or
carried
off
into
banishment
without
their
knowledge
next
morning
cyprian
was
led
to
the
place
of
judgment
which
was
a
little
way
from
the
governor
palace
he
was
heated
with
the
walk
under
a
burning
sun
and
as
he
was
waiting
for
the
governor
arrival
a
soldier
of
the
guard
who
had
once
been
a
christian
kindly
offered
him
some
change
of
clothes
why
said
the
bishop
should
we
trouble
ourselves
to
remedy
evils
which
will
probably
come
to
an
end
the
governor
took
his
seat
and
required
cyprian
to
sacrifice
to
the
gods
he
refused
and
the
governor
then
desired
him
to
consider
his
safety
in
so
righteous
a
cause
answered
the
bishop
there
is
no
need
of
consideration
and
on
hearing
the
sentence
which
condemned
him
to
be
beheaded
he
exclaimed
praise
be
to
god
a
cry
arose
from
the
christians
let
us
go
and
be
beheaded
with
him
he
was
then
led
by
soldiers
to
the
place
of
execution
many
of
his
people
climbed
up
into
the
trees
which
surrounded
it
that
they
might
see
the
last
of
their
good
bishop
after
having
prayed
he
took
off
his
upper
clothing
he
gave
some
money
to
the
executioner
and
as
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
blindfolded
before
suffering
he
tied
the
bandage
over
his
own
eyes
two
of
his
friends
then
bound
his
hands
and
the
christians
placed
cloths
and
handkerchiefs
around
him
that
they
might
catch
some
of
his
blood
and
thus
cyprian
was
martyred
in
the
year
valerian
attempts
against
the
gospel
were
all
in
vain
the
church
had
been
purified
and
strengthened
by
the
persecution
under
decius
so
that
there
were
now
very
few
who
fell
away
for
fear
of
death
the
faith
was
spread
by
the
banished
bishops
in
the
same
way
as
it
had
been
in
the
last
persecution
and
as
has
ever
been
found
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
was
the
seed
of
the
church
see
page
chapter
ix
from
gallienus
to
the
end
of
the
last
persecution
valerian
who
had
treated
the
christians
so
cruelly
came
to
a
miserable
end
he
led
his
army
into
persia
where
he
was
defeated
and
taken
prisoner
he
was
kept
for
some
time
in
captivity
and
we
are
told
that
he
used
to
be
led
forth
loaded
with
chains
but
with
the
purple
robes
of
an
emperor
thrown
over
him
that
the
persians
might
mock
at
his
misfortunes
and
when
he
had
died
from
the
effects
of
shame
and
grief
it
is
said
that
his
skin
was
stuffed
with
straw
and
was
kept
in
a
temple
as
a
remembrance
of
the
triumph
which
the
persians
had
gained
over
the
romans
whose
pride
had
never
been
so
humbled
before
when
valerian
was
taken
prisoner
his
son
gallienus
became
emperor
gallienus
sent
forth
a
law
by
which
the
christians
for
the
first
time
got
the
liberty
of
serving
god
without
the
risk
of
being
persecuted
we
might
think
him
a
good
emperor
for
making
such
a
law
but
he
really
does
not
deserve
much
credit
for
it
since
he
seems
to
have
made
it
merely
because
he
did
not
care
much
either
for
his
own
religion
or
for
any
other
and
now
there
is
hardly
anything
to
be
said
of
the
next
forty
years
except
that
the
christians
enjoyed
peace
and
prosperity
instead
of
being
obliged
to
hold
their
services
in
the
upper
rooms
of
houses
or
in
under
ground
and
in
the
dead
of
night
they
built
splendid
churches
which
they
furnished
with
gold
and
silver
plate
and
with
other
costly
ornaments
christians
were
appointed
to
high
offices
such
as
the
government
of
countries
and
many
of
them
held
places
in
the
emperor
palace
and
now
that
there
was
no
danger
or
loss
to
be
risked
by
being
christians
multitudes
of
people
joined
the
church
who
would
have
kept
at
a
distance
from
it
if
there
had
been
anything
to
fear
but
unhappily
the
christians
did
not
make
a
good
use
of
all
their
prosperity
many
of
them
grew
worldly
and
careless
and
had
little
of
the
christian
about
them
except
the
name
and
they
quarrelled
and
disputed
among
themselves
as
if
they
were
no
better
than
mere
heathens
but
it
pleased
god
to
punish
them
severely
for
their
faults
for
at
length
there
came
such
a
persecution
as
had
never
before
been
known
at
this
time
there
were
no
fewer
than
four
emperors
at
once
for
diocletian
who
became
emperor
in
the
year
afterwards
took
in
maximian
galerius
and
constantius
to
share
his
power
and
to
help
him
in
the
labour
of
government
galerius
and
constantius
however
were
not
quite
so
high
and
had
not
such
full
authority
as
the
other
two
galerius
married
diocletian
daughter
and
it
was
supposed
that
both
this
lady
and
the
empress
her
mother
were
christians
the
priests
and
others
whose
interest
it
was
to
keep
up
the
old
heathenism
began
to
be
afraid
lest
the
empresses
should
make
christians
of
their
husbands
and
they
sought
how
this
might
be
prevented
now
the
heathens
had
some
ways
by
which
they
used
to
try
to
find
out
the
will
of
their
gods
sometimes
they
offered
sacrifices
of
beasts
and
when
the
beasts
were
killed
they
cut
them
open
and
judged
from
the
appearance
of
the
inside
whether
the
gods
were
well
pleased
or
angry
and
at
certain
places
there
were
what
they
called
where
people
who
wished
to
know
the
will
of
the
gods
went
through
some
ceremonies
and
expected
a
voice
to
come
from
this
or
that
god
in
answer
to
them
sure
enough
the
voice
very
often
come
although
it
was
not
really
from
any
god
but
was
managed
by
the
juggling
of
the
priests
and
the
answers
which
these
voices
gave
were
often
contrived
very
cunningly
that
they
might
have
more
than
one
meaning
so
that
however
things
might
turn
out
the
oracle
was
sure
to
come
true
and
now
the
priests
set
to
frighten
diocletian
with
tricks
of
this
kinds
when
he
sacrificed
the
insides
of
the
victims
as
the
beasts
offered
in
sacrifice
were
called
were
said
to
look
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
that
the
gods
were
angry
when
he
consulted
the
oracles
answers
were
given
declaring
that
so
long
as
christians
were
allowed
to
live
on
the
earth
the
gods
would
be
displeased
and
thus
diocletian
although
at
first
he
had
been
inclined
to
let
them
alone
became
terrified
and
was
ready
to
persecute
the
first
order
against
the
christians
was
a
proclamation
requiring
that
all
soldiers
and
all
persons
who
held
any
office
under
the
emperor
should
sacrifice
to
the
heathen
gods
and
five
years
after
this
galerius
who
was
a
cruel
man
and
very
bitter
against
the
christians
although
his
wife
was
supposed
to
be
one
persuaded
diocletian
to
begin
a
persecution
in
earnest
diocletian
did
not
usually
live
at
rome
like
the
earlier
emperors
but
at
nicomedia
a
town
in
asia
minor
on
the
shore
of
the
propontis
now
called
the
sea
of
marmora
and
there
the
persecution
began
by
his
sending
forth
an
order
that
all
who
would
not
serve
the
gods
of
rome
should
lose
their
offices
that
their
property
should
be
seized
and
if
they
were
persons
of
rank
they
should
lose
their
rank
christians
were
no
longer
allowed
to
meet
for
worship
their
churches
were
to
be
destroyed
and
their
holy
books
were
to
be
sought
out
and
burnt
as
soon
as
this
proclamation
was
set
forth
a
christian
tore
it
down
and
broke
into
loud
reproaches
against
the
emperors
such
violent
acts
and
words
were
not
becoming
in
a
follower
of
him
who
when
he
was
reviled
reviled
not
again
and
when
he
suffered
threatened
not
ii
but
the
man
who
had
forgotten
himself
so
far
showed
the
strength
of
his
principles
in
the
patience
with
which
he
bore
the
punishment
of
what
he
had
done
for
he
was
roasted
alive
at
a
slow
fire
and
did
not
even
utter
a
groan
this
was
in
february
and
before
the
end
of
that
year
diocletian
put
forth
three
more
proclamations
against
the
christians
one
of
them
ordered
that
the
christian
teachers
should
be
imprisoned
and
very
soon
the
prisons
were
filled
with
bishops
and
clergy
while
the
who
were
usually
confined
in
them
were
turned
loose
the
next
proclamation
ordered
that
the
prisoners
should
either
sacrifice
or
be
tortured
and
the
fourth
directed
that
not
only
the
bishops
and
clergy
but
all
christians
should
be
required
to
sacrifice
on
pain
of
torture
these
cruel
laws
were
put
in
execution
churches
were
pulled
down
beginning
with
the
great
church
of
nicomedia
which
was
built
on
a
height
and
overlooked
the
emperor
palace
all
the
bibles
and
that
could
be
found
and
a
great
number
of
other
christian
writings
were
thrown
into
the
flames
and
many
christians
who
refused
to
give
up
their
holy
books
were
put
to
death
the
plate
of
churches
was
carried
off
and
was
turned
to
profane
uses
as
the
vessels
of
the
jewish
temple
had
formerly
been
by
belshazzar
the
sufferings
of
the
christians
were
frightful
but
after
what
has
been
already
said
of
such
things
i
shall
not
shock
you
by
telling
you
much
about
them
here
some
were
thrown
to
wild
beasts
some
were
burnt
alive
or
roasted
on
gridirons
some
had
their
skins
pulled
off
or
their
flesh
scraped
from
their
bones
some
were
crucified
some
were
tied
to
branches
of
trees
which
had
been
bent
so
as
to
meet
and
then
they
were
torn
to
pieces
by
the
starting
asunder
of
the
branches
thousands
of
them
perished
by
one
horrible
death
or
other
so
that
the
heathens
themselves
grew
tired
and
disgusted
with
inflicting
or
seeing
their
sufferings
and
at
length
instead
of
putting
them
to
death
they
sent
them
to
work
in
mines
or
plucked
out
one
of
their
eyes
or
lamed
one
of
their
hands
or
feet
or
set
bishops
to
look
after
horses
or
camels
or
to
do
other
work
unfit
for
persons
of
their
venerable
character
and
it
is
impossible
to
think
what
miseries
even
those
who
escaped
must
have
undergone
for
the
persecution
lasted
ten
years
and
they
had
not
only
to
witness
the
sufferings
of
their
own
dear
relations
or
friends
or
teachers
but
knew
that
the
like
might
at
any
hour
come
on
themselves
it
was
in
the
east
that
the
persecution
was
hottest
and
lasted
longest
for
in
europe
it
was
not
much
felt
after
the
first
two
years
the
emperor
constantius
who
ruled
over
gaul
now
called
france
spain
and
britain
was
kind
to
the
christians
and
after
his
death
his
son
constantine
was
still
more
favourable
to
them
there
were
several
changes
among
the
other
emperors
and
the
christians
felt
them
for
better
or
for
worse
according
to
the
character
of
each
emperor
but
it
is
needless
to
speak
much
of
them
in
a
little
book
like
this
galerius
went
on
in
his
cruelty
until
at
the
end
of
eight
years
he
found
that
it
had
been
of
no
use
towards
putting
down
the
gospel
and
that
he
was
sinking
under
a
fearful
disease
something
like
that
of
which
herod
who
had
killed
james
died
xii
he
then
thought
with
grief
and
horror
of
what
he
had
done
and
perhaps
in
the
hope
of
getting
some
relief
from
the
god
of
christians
he
sent
forth
a
proclamation
allowing
them
to
rebuild
their
churches
and
to
hold
their
worship
and
begging
them
to
remember
him
in
their
prayers
soon
after
this
he
died
the
cruellest
of
all
the
persecutors
was
maximin
who
from
the
year
had
possession
of
asia
minor
syria
the
holy
land
and
egypt
when
galerius
made
his
law
in
favour
of
the
christians
maximin
for
a
while
pretended
to
give
them
the
same
kind
of
liberty
in
dominions
but
he
soon
changed
again
and
required
that
all
his
subjects
should
sacrifice
even
that
little
babies
should
take
some
grains
of
incense
into
their
hands
and
should
burn
it
in
honour
of
the
heathen
gods
and
when
a
season
of
great
plenty
followed
after
this
maximin
boasted
that
it
was
a
sign
of
the
favour
with
which
the
gods
received
his
law
but
it
very
soon
appeared
how
false
his
boast
was
for
famine
and
plague
began
to
rage
throughout
his
dominions
the
christians
of
course
had
their
share
in
the
distress
but
instead
of
triumphing
over
their
persecutors
they
showed
the
true
spirit
of
the
gospel
by
treating
them
with
kindness
by
relieving
the
poor
by
tending
the
sick
and
by
burying
the
dead
who
had
been
abandoned
by
their
own
nearest
relations
although
there
is
no
room
to
give
any
particular
account
of
the
martyrs
here
there
is
one
of
them
who
especially
deserves
to
be
remembered
because
he
was
the
first
who
suffered
in
our
own
island
this
good
man
alban
while
he
was
yet
a
heathen
fell
in
with
a
poor
christian
priest
who
was
trying
to
hide
himself
from
the
persecutors
alban
took
him
into
his
own
house
and
sheltered
him
there
and
he
was
so
much
struck
with
observing
how
the
priest
prayed
to
god
and
spent
long
hours
of
the
night
in
religious
exercises
that
he
soon
became
a
believer
in
christ
but
the
priest
was
hotly
searched
for
and
information
was
given
that
he
was
hidden
in
alban
house
and
when
the
soldiers
came
to
look
for
him
there
alban
knew
their
errand
and
put
on
the
priest
dress
so
that
the
soldiers
seized
him
and
carried
him
before
the
judge
the
judge
found
that
they
had
brought
the
wrong
man
and
in
his
rage
at
the
disappointment
he
told
alban
that
he
must
himself
endure
the
punishment
which
had
been
meant
for
the
other
alban
heard
this
without
any
fear
and
on
being
questioned
he
declared
that
he
was
a
christian
a
worshipper
of
the
one
true
god
and
that
he
would
not
sacrifice
to
idols
which
could
do
no
good
he
was
put
to
the
torture
but
bore
it
gladly
for
his
saviour
sake
and
then
as
he
was
still
firm
in
professing
his
faith
the
judge
gave
orders
that
he
should
be
beheaded
and
when
he
had
been
led
out
to
the
place
of
execution
which
was
a
little
grassy
knoll
that
rose
gently
on
one
side
of
the
town
the
soldier
who
was
to
have
put
him
to
death
was
so
moved
by
the
sight
of
alban
behaviour
that
he
threw
away
his
sword
and
desired
to
be
put
to
death
with
him
they
were
both
beheaded
and
the
town
of
verulam
where
they
suffered
has
since
been
called
alban
from
the
name
of
the
first
british
martyr
this
martyrdom
took
place
early
in
the
persecution
but
as
we
have
seen
constantius
afterwards
protected
the
british
christians
and
his
son
constantine
who
succeeded
to
his
share
in
the
empire
treated
them
with
yet
greater
favour
in
the
year
constantine
marched
against
maxentius
who
had
usurped
the
government
of
italy
and
africa
constantine
seems
to
have
been
brought
up
by
his
father
to
believe
in
one
god
although
he
did
not
at
all
know
who
this
god
was
nor
how
he
had
revealed
himself
in
holy
scripture
but
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
fight
maxentius
he
saw
in
the
sky
a
wonderful
appearance
which
seemed
like
the
figure
of
a
cross
with
words
around
it
by
this
conquer
he
then
caused
the
cross
to
be
put
on
the
standards
or
colours
of
his
army
and
when
he
had
defeated
maxentius
he
set
up
at
rome
a
statue
of
himself
with
a
cross
in
its
right
hand
and
with
an
inscription
which
declared
that
he
owed
his
victory
to
that
saving
sign
about
the
same
time
that
constantine
overcame
maxentius
licinius
put
down
maximin
in
the
east
the
two
conquerors
now
had
possession
of
the
whole
empire
and
they
joined
in
publishing
laws
by
which
christians
were
allowed
to
worship
god
freely
according
to
their
conscience
chapter
constantine
the
great
it
was
a
great
thing
for
the
church
that
the
emperor
of
rome
should
give
it
liberty
and
constantine
after
sending
forth
the
laws
which
put
an
end
to
the
persecution
went
on
to
make
other
laws
in
favour
of
the
christians
but
he
did
not
himself
become
a
christian
all
at
once
although
he
built
many
churches
and
gave
rich
presents
to
others
and
although
he
was
fond
of
keeping
company
with
bishops
and
of
conversing
with
them
about
religion
licinius
the
emperor
of
the
east
who
had
joined
with
constantine
in
his
first
laws
afterwards
quarrelled
with
him
and
persecuted
the
eastern
christians
cruelly
but
constantine
defeated
him
in
battle
and
the
whole
empire
was
once
more
united
under
one
head
after
his
victory
over
licinius
constantine
declared
himself
a
christian
which
he
had
not
done
before
and
he
used
to
attend
the
services
of
the
church
very
regularly
and
to
stand
all
the
time
that
the
bishops
were
preaching
however
long
their
sermons
might
be
he
used
even
himself
to
write
a
kind
of
discourses
something
like
sermons
and
to
read
them
aloud
in
the
palace
to
all
his
court
but
he
really
knew
very
little
of
christian
doctrine
although
he
was
very
fond
of
taking
part
in
disputes
about
it
and
although
he
professed
to
be
a
christian
he
had
not
yet
been
made
a
member
of
christ
by
baptism
for
in
those
days
people
had
so
high
a
notion
of
the
grace
of
baptism
that
many
of
them
put
off
their
baptism
until
they
supposed
that
they
were
on
their
for
fear
lest
they
should
sin
after
being
baptized
and
so
should
lose
the
benefit
of
the
sacrament
this
was
of
course
wrong
for
it
was
a
sad
mistake
to
think
that
they
might
go
on
in
sin
so
long
as
they
were
not
baptized
god
we
know
might
have
cut
them
off
at
any
moment
in
the
midst
of
all
their
sins
and
even
if
they
were
spared
there
was
a
great
danger
that
when
they
came
to
beg
for
baptism
at
last
they
might
not
have
that
true
spirit
of
repentance
and
faith
without
which
they
could
not
be
fit
to
receive
the
grace
of
the
sacrament
and
therefore
the
teachers
of
the
church
used
to
warn
people
against
putting
off
their
baptism
out
of
a
love
for
sin
and
when
any
one
had
received
baptism
as
it
was
called
that
is
to
say
on
a
if
he
afterwards
got
well
again
he
was
thought
but
little
of
in
the
church
but
to
come
back
to
constantine
he
had
many
other
faults
besides
his
unwillingness
to
take
on
himself
the
duties
of
a
baptized
christian
and
although
we
are
bound
to
thank
god
for
having
turned
his
heart
to
favour
the
church
we
must
not
be
blind
to
the
emperor
faults
yet
with
all
these
faults
he
really
believed
the
gospel
and
meant
to
do
what
he
could
for
the
truth
it
took
a
long
time
to
put
down
heathenism
for
it
would
not
have
been
safe
or
wise
to
force
people
to
become
christians
before
they
had
come
to
see
the
falsehood
of
their
old
religion
constantine
therefore
only
made
laws
against
some
of
its
worst
practices
and
forbade
any
sacrifices
to
be
offered
in
the
name
of
the
empire
but
he
did
not
hinder
the
heathens
from
sacrificing
on
their
own
account
if
they
liked
soon
after
professing
himself
a
christian
the
emperor
began
to
build
a
new
capital
in
the
east
there
had
been
a
town
called
byzantium
on
the
spot
before
but
the
new
city
was
far
grander
and
he
gave
it
the
name
of
which
means
the
of
it
was
meant
to
be
altogether
christian
unlike
rome
which
was
full
of
temples
of
heathen
gods
and
the
emperors
from
this
time
usually
lived
at
constantinople
or
at
some
other
place
in
the
east
there
will
be
more
to
say
about
constantine
in
the
next
chapter
in
the
mean
time
let
us
look
at
the
progress
of
the
gospel
it
had
by
this
time
made
its
way
into
many
countries
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
empire
there
were
christians
in
scotland
and
in
india
there
had
long
been
great
numbers
of
christians
in
persia
and
arabia
many
of
the
goths
who
then
lived
about
the
danube
had
been
converted
by
captives
whom
they
carried
off
in
their
plundering
expeditions
during
the
reigns
of
valerian
and
gallienus
about
and
other
roving
tribes
had
been
converted
by
the
same
means
about
the
end
of
the
third
century
gregory
who
is
called
the
had
gone
as
a
missionary
bishop
into
armenia
where
he
persuaded
the
king
tiridates
to
receive
the
gospel
and
to
establish
it
as
the
religion
of
his
country
so
that
armenia
had
the
honour
of
being
the
first
christian
kingdom
the
georgians
were
converted
in
the
reign
of
constantine
and
about
the
same
time
the
ethiopians
or
abyssinians
who
live
to
the
south
of
egypt
were
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
in
a
very
remarkable
way
there
was
a
rich
christian
of
tyre
named
meropius
who
was
a
philosopher
and
wished
to
make
discoveries
in
the
countries
towards
india
which
were
then
but
little
known
so
he
set
out
in
a
ship
of
his
own
sailed
down
the
red
sea
and
made
a
voyage
to
the
east
on
his
way
back
he
and
his
crew
landed
at
a
place
on
the
coast
of
ethiopia
in
search
of
fresh
water
when
the
people
of
the
country
fell
on
them
and
killed
all
but
two
youths
named
ædesius
and
frumentius
who
were
relations
of
meropius
these
lads
were
taken
to
the
king
court
where
as
they
were
better
educated
than
the
ethiopians
they
soon
got
into
great
favour
and
power
the
king
died
after
a
time
leaving
a
little
boy
to
succeed
him
and
the
two
strangers
were
asked
to
carry
on
the
government
of
the
country
until
the
prince
should
be
old
enough
to
take
it
into
his
own
hands
they
did
this
faithfully
and
stayed
many
years
in
ethiopia
and
they
used
to
look
out
for
any
christian
sailors
or
merchants
who
visited
the
country
and
to
hold
meetings
with
such
strangers
and
others
for
worship
although
they
were
distressed
that
they
had
no
clergy
to
minister
to
them
at
length
the
young
prince
grew
up
to
manhood
and
was
able
to
govern
his
kingdom
for
himself
and
then
ædesius
and
frumentius
set
out
for
their
own
country
which
they
had
been
longing
to
see
for
so
many
years
ædesius
got
back
to
tyre
where
he
became
a
deacon
of
the
church
but
frumentius
stopped
at
alexandria
and
told
his
tale
to
the
bishop
the
great
athanasius
of
whom
we
shall
hear
more
and
he
begged
that
a
bishop
might
be
sent
into
ethiopia
to
settle
and
govern
the
church
there
athanasius
considering
how
faithful
and
wise
frumentius
had
shown
himself
in
all
his
business
how
greatly
he
was
respected
and
loved
by
the
ethiopians
and
how
much
he
had
done
to
spread
the
gospel
in
the
land
of
his
captivity
said
that
no
one
was
so
fit
as
he
to
be
bishop
and
he
consecrated
frumentius
accordingly
to
this
day
the
chief
bishop
of
the
abyssinian
church
instead
of
being
chosen
from
among
the
clergy
of
the
country
is
always
a
person
sent
by
the
egyptian
bishop
of
alexandria
and
thus
the
abyssinians
still
keep
up
the
remembrance
of
the
way
in
which
their
church
was
founded
although
the
bishopric
of
alexandria
is
now
sadly
fallen
from
the
height
at
which
it
stood
in
the
days
of
athanasius
and
frumentius
constantine
used
his
influence
with
the
king
of
persia
whose
name
was
sapor
to
obtain
good
treatment
for
the
christians
of
that
country
and
the
gospel
continued
to
make
progress
there
but
this
naturally
raised
the
jealousy
of
the
magi
who
were
the
priests
of
the
heathen
religion
of
persia
and
they
looked
out
for
some
means
of
doing
mischief
to
the
christians
so
a
few
years
after
the
death
of
constantine
when
a
war
broke
out
between
sapor
and
the
next
emperor
constantius
these
magi
got
about
the
king
and
told
him
that
his
christian
subjects
would
be
ready
to
betray
him
to
the
romans
from
whom
they
had
got
their
religion
sapor
then
issued
orders
that
all
christians
should
pay
an
enormous
tax
unless
they
would
worship
the
gods
of
the
persians
their
chief
bishop
whose
name
was
symeon
on
receiving
this
order
answered
that
the
tax
was
more
than
they
could
pay
and
that
they
worshipped
the
true
god
alone
who
had
made
the
sun
which
the
persians
ignorantly
adored
sapor
then
sent
forth
a
second
order
that
the
bishops
priests
and
deacons
of
the
christians
should
be
put
to
death
that
their
churches
should
be
destroyed
and
that
the
plate
and
ornaments
of
the
churches
should
be
taken
for
profane
uses
and
he
sent
for
symeon
who
was
soon
brought
before
him
the
bishop
had
been
used
to
make
obeisance
to
the
king
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
but
on
coming
into
his
presence
now
he
refused
to
do
so
lest
it
should
be
taken
as
a
sign
of
that
reverence
which
he
was
resolved
to
give
to
god
alone
sapor
then
required
him
to
worship
the
sun
and
told
him
that
by
doing
so
he
might
deliver
himself
and
his
people
but
the
bishop
answered
that
if
he
had
refused
to
do
reverence
to
the
king
much
more
must
he
refuse
such
honour
to
the
sun
which
was
a
thing
without
reason
or
life
on
this
the
king
ordered
that
he
should
be
thrown
into
prison
until
next
day
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
prison
symeon
passed
an
old
and
faithful
servant
of
the
king
named
uthazanes
who
had
brought
up
sapor
from
a
child
and
stood
high
in
his
favour
uthazanes
seeing
the
bishop
led
away
in
chains
fell
on
his
knee
and
saluted
him
in
the
persian
fashion
but
symeon
turned
away
his
head
and
would
not
look
at
him
for
uthazanes
had
been
a
christian
and
had
lately
denied
the
faith
the
old
man
conscience
was
smitten
by
this
and
he
burst
out
into
lamentation
if
my
old
and
familiar
friend
disowns
me
thus
what
may
i
expect
from
my
god
whom
i
have
denied
his
words
were
heard
and
he
was
carried
before
the
king
who
tried
to
move
him
both
by
threats
and
by
kindness
but
uthazanes
stood
firm
against
everything
and
as
he
could
not
be
shaken
in
his
faith
he
was
sentenced
to
be
beheaded
he
then
begged
the
king
for
the
sake
of
the
love
which
had
long
been
between
them
to
grant
him
the
favour
that
it
might
be
proclaimed
why
he
died
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
any
treason
but
was
put
to
death
only
for
being
a
christian
sapor
was
very
willing
to
allow
this
because
he
thought
that
it
would
frighten
others
into
worshipping
his
gods
but
it
turned
out
as
uthazanes
had
hoped
for
when
it
was
seen
how
he
loved
his
faith
better
than
life
itself
other
christians
were
encouraged
to
suffer
and
even
some
heathens
were
brought
over
to
the
gospel
bishop
symeon
was
put
to
death
after
having
seen
a
hundred
of
his
clergy
suffer
before
his
eyes
and
the
persecution
was
renewed
from
time
to
time
throughout
the
remainder
of
sapor
long
reign
chapter
xi
the
council
of
nicæa
we
might
expect
to
find
that
when
the
persecutions
by
the
heathen
were
at
an
end
within
the
roman
empire
christians
lived
together
in
peace
and
love
according
to
their
lord
commandment
but
it
is
a
sad
truth
that
they
now
began
to
be
very
much
divided
by
quarrels
among
themselves
there
had
indeed
been
many
false
teachers
in
earlier
times
but
now
when
the
emperor
had
become
a
christian
the
troubles
caused
by
such
persons
reached
much
further
than
before
the
emperors
took
part
in
them
and
made
laws
about
them
and
the
whole
empire
was
stirred
by
them
constantine
was
as
i
have
said
very
fond
of
taking
a
part
in
church
matters
without
knowing
much
about
them
very
soon
after
the
first
law
by
which
he
gave
liberty
to
the
christians
he
was
called
in
to
settle
a
quarrel
which
had
been
raised
in
africa
by
the
followers
of
one
donatus
who
separated
from
the
church
and
set
up
bishops
of
their
own
because
they
said
that
the
bishops
of
carthage
and
some
others
had
not
behaved
rightly
when
the
persecutors
required
them
to
deliver
up
the
scriptures
i
will
tell
you
more
about
these
as
they
are
called
and
i
mention
them
now
only
because
it
was
they
who
first
invited
the
emperor
to
judge
in
a
dispute
about
religion
page
see
chapter
parts
and
when
constantine
put
down
licinius
and
got
possession
of
the
east
as
has
been
said
he
found
that
a
dispute
of
a
different
kind
from
the
quarrel
of
the
donatists
was
raging
there
one
arius
a
presbyter
or
priest
of
alexandria
had
begun
some
years
before
this
time
to
deny
that
our
blessed
lord
was
god
from
everlasting
arius
was
a
crafty
man
and
did
all
that
he
could
to
make
his
opinion
look
as
well
as
possible
but
try
as
he
might
he
was
obliged
to
own
that
he
believed
our
lord
to
be
a
and
the
difference
between
the
highest
of
created
beings
and
god
the
maker
of
all
creatures
is
infinite
so
that
it
mattered
little
how
arius
might
smooth
over
his
shocking
opinion
so
long
as
he
did
not
allow
our
lord
to
be
truly
god
from
all
eternity
the
bishop
of
alexandria
whose
name
was
alexander
excommunicated
arius
for
his
impiety
that
is
to
say
he
solemnly
turned
him
out
of
the
church
so
that
no
faithful
christian
should
have
anything
to
do
with
him
in
religious
matters
thus
arius
was
obliged
to
leave
egypt
and
he
lived
for
a
while
at
nicomedia
with
a
bishop
who
was
an
old
friend
of
his
and
while
he
was
there
he
made
a
set
of
songs
to
be
sung
at
meals
and
others
for
travellers
sailors
and
the
like
he
hoped
that
people
would
learn
these
songs
without
considering
what
mischief
was
in
them
and
that
so
his
heresy
would
be
spread
when
constantine
first
heard
of
these
troubles
he
tried
to
quiet
them
by
advising
alexander
and
arius
not
to
dispute
about
trifles
but
he
soon
found
that
this
would
not
do
and
that
the
question
whether
our
lord
and
saviour
were
god
or
a
creature
was
so
far
from
being
a
trifle
that
it
was
one
of
the
most
serious
of
all
questions
in
order
therefore
to
get
this
and
some
other
matters
settled
he
gave
orders
for
a
general
council
to
meet
councils
of
bishops
within
a
certain
district
had
long
been
common
in
many
countries
they
were
regularly
held
once
or
twice
a
year
and
besides
these
regular
meetings
others
were
sometimes
called
together
to
consider
any
business
which
was
particularly
pressing
some
of
these
councils
were
very
great
for
instance
the
bishop
of
alexander
could
call
together
the
bishops
of
all
egypt
and
the
bishop
of
antioch
could
call
together
all
the
bishops
of
syria
and
some
neighbouring
countries
but
there
was
no
bishop
who
could
call
a
council
of
the
whole
church
because
there
was
no
one
who
had
any
power
over
more
than
a
part
of
it
but
now
constantine
as
he
had
become
a
christian
thought
that
he
might
gather
a
council
from
all
quarters
of
his
empire
and
this
was
the
first
of
what
are
called
the
councils
it
met
in
the
year
at
nicæa
or
nice
in
bithynia
and
bishops
attended
it
a
number
of
clergy
and
other
persons
were
also
present
even
some
heathen
philosophers
went
out
of
curiosity
to
see
what
the
christians
were
to
do
many
of
the
bishops
were
very
homely
and
simple
men
who
had
not
much
learning
but
their
great
business
was
only
to
say
plainly
what
their
belief
had
always
been
so
that
it
might
be
known
whether
the
doctrines
of
arius
agreed
with
this
or
no
and
thus
the
good
bishops
might
do
their
part
very
well
although
they
were
not
persons
of
any
great
learning
or
cleverness
one
of
these
simpler
bishops
was
drawn
into
talk
by
a
philosopher
who
tried
to
puzzle
him
about
the
truth
of
the
gospel
the
bishop
was
not
used
to
argue
or
to
dispute
much
and
might
have
been
no
match
for
the
philosopher
in
that
way
but
he
contented
himself
with
saying
his
creed
and
the
philosopher
was
so
struck
with
this
that
he
took
to
thinking
more
seriously
of
christianity
than
he
had
ever
thought
before
and
he
ended
in
becoming
a
christian
himself
there
was
a
great
deal
of
arguing
about
arius
and
his
opinions
and
the
chief
person
who
spoke
against
him
was
athanasius
a
clergyman
of
alexandria
who
had
come
with
the
bishop
alexander
athanasius
could
not
sit
as
a
judge
in
the
council
because
he
was
not
a
bishop
but
he
was
allowed
to
speak
in
the
presence
of
the
bishops
and
pointed
out
to
them
the
errors
which
arius
tried
to
hide
so
at
last
arius
was
condemned
and
the
emperor
banished
him
with
some
of
his
chief
followers
and
in
order
to
set
forth
the
true
christian
faith
beyond
all
doubt
the
council
made
that
creed
which
is
read
in
the
in
our
churches
all
but
some
of
the
last
part
of
it
which
was
made
at
a
later
time
as
we
shall
see
it
is
called
the
creed
from
the
name
of
the
place
where
the
council
met
and
the
great
point
in
it
is
that
it
declares
our
blessed
lord
to
be
very
god
of
very
god
begotten
not
made
being
of
that
is
to
say
the
same
with
the
father
for
this
truth
that
our
lord
has
the
with
the
almighty
father
this
truth
that
he
is
really
from
everlasting
was
what
the
arians
could
not
be
brought
to
own
the
emperor
attended
the
council
during
the
latter
part
of
its
sittings
and
a
story
is
told
of
him
and
a
bishop
named
acesius
who
belonged
to
the
sect
of
novatianists
you
will
remember
that
this
sect
broke
off
from
the
church
in
cyprian
days
because
novatian
and
others
thought
that
cyprian
and
the
church
were
too
easy
with
those
who
repented
after
having
sacrificed
in
time
of
persecution
and
from
having
begun
thus
it
came
to
be
hard
in
its
notions
as
to
the
treatment
of
all
sorts
of
penitents
but
as
it
had
been
only
about
the
treatment
of
persons
who
had
behaved
weakly
in
persecution
that
the
novatianists
at
first
differed
from
the
church
and
as
persecution
by
the
heathens
was
now
at
an
end
constantine
hoped
that
perhaps
they
might
be
persuaded
to
return
to
the
church
so
he
invited
some
bishops
of
the
sect
to
attend
the
council
and
acesius
among
them
when
the
creed
had
been
made
acesius
declared
that
it
was
all
true
and
that
it
was
the
same
faith
which
he
had
always
believed
and
he
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
rules
which
the
council
made
as
to
the
time
of
keeping
easter
and
as
to
some
other
things
why
then
asked
constantine
will
you
not
join
the
church
acesius
said
that
he
did
not
think
the
church
strict
enough
in
dealing
with
penitents
take
a
ladder
then
said
the
emperor
and
go
up
to
heaven
by
yourself

chapter
xii
athanasius
part
alexander
the
bishop
of
alexandria
by
whom
arius
had
been
excommunicated
died
soon
after
returning
home
from
the
council
of
nicæa
and
athanasius
who
was
then
about
thirty
years
of
age
was
chosen
in
his
stead
and
governed
the
alexandrian
church
for
years
every
one
knows
the
name
of
athanasius
from
the
creed
which
is
called
after
it
that
creed
indeed
was
not
made
by
athanasius
himself
but
as
the
says
it
is
his
because
it
sets
forth
the
true
christian
faith
of
which
he
was
the
chief
defender
in
his
day
and
we
are
bound
to
honour
this
learned
and
holy
bishop
as
the
man
by
whom
especially
god
was
pleased
that
his
truth
should
be
upheld
and
established
against
all
the
craft
of
arius
and
his
party
and
even
against
all
the
power
of
the
emperors
of
rome
for
although
arius
had
been
sent
into
banishment
he
soon
managed
to
get
into
favour
at
the
emperor
court
one
of
his
friends
a
priest
gained
the
ear
of
constantine
sister
and
this
princess
when
she
was
dying
recommended
the
priest
to
the
emperor
neither
constantine
nor
his
sister
understood
enough
of
the
matter
to
be
on
their
guard
against
the
deceits
of
the
arian
who
was
able
to
persuade
the
emperor
that
arius
had
been
and
that
he
did
not
really
hold
the
opinions
for
which
the
council
had
condemned
him
arius
then
was
allowed
to
return
from
banishment
and
constantine
desired
athanasius
to
receive
him
back
into
the
church
saying
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
the
errors
which
had
been
laid
to
his
charge
but
athanasius
knew
that
this
was
only
a
trick
and
he
answered
that
as
arius
had
been
condemned
by
a
council
of
the
whole
church
he
could
not
be
restored
by
anything
less
than
another
such
council
the
arians
on
finding
that
they
could
not
win
athanasius
over
resolved
to
attack
him
they
contrived
that
all
sorts
of
charges
against
him
should
be
carried
to
the
emperor
and
in
the
year
a
council
was
held
at
tyre
for
his
trial
one
story
was
that
he
had
killed
an
egyptian
bishop
named
arsenius
that
he
had
cut
off
his
hand
and
had
used
it
for
magical
purposes
for
among
other
things
athanasius
was
said
by
his
enemies
to
be
a
sorcerer
and
the
dried
hand
of
a
man
was
shown
which
was
said
to
be
that
of
arsenius
but
when
the
time
came
for
examining
this
charge
what
was
the
confusion
of
the
accusers
at
seeing
arsenius
himself
brought
into
the
council
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
cloak
and
athanasius
lifted
it
up
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
so
as
to
show
that
the
man
was
not
only
alive
but
had
both
his
hands
safe
and
sound
the
leaders
of
the
arians
had
known
that
arsenius
was
not
dead
but
they
had
hoped
that
he
would
not
appear
but
happily
for
athanasius
one
of
his
friends
had
discovered
arsenius
and
had
kept
him
hidden
until
the
right
moment
came
for
producing
him
athanasius
was
able
to
answer
the
other
charges
against
him
as
well
as
that
about
arsenius
and
the
arians
seeing
that
they
must
contrive
some
new
accusation
sent
some
of
his
bitterest
enemies
into
egypt
to
rake
up
all
the
tales
that
they
could
find
athanasius
knew
what
he
might
expect
from
people
who
could
act
so
unfairly
he
therefore
resolved
not
to
wait
for
their
return
but
got
on
board
a
ship
which
was
bound
for
constantinople
on
arriving
there
he
posted
himself
in
a
spot
outside
the
city
where
he
expected
the
emperor
to
pass
in
returning
from
a
ride
and
when
constantine
came
up
he
threw
himself
in
his
way
the
emperor
was
startled
but
athanasius
told
him
who
he
was
and
entreated
him
by
the
thought
of
that
judgment
in
which
princes
as
well
as
subjects
must
one
day
appear
to
order
that
the
case
should
be
tried
before
himself
instead
of
leaving
it
to
judges
from
whom
no
justice
was
to
be
looked
for
the
emperor
agreed
to
this
and
was
very
angry
with
those
who
had
behaved
so
unjustly
in
the
council
at
tyre
but
after
a
time
some
of
the
arians
got
about
him
and
told
him
another
story
that
athanasius
had
threatened
to
stop
the
sailing
of
the
fleet
which
carried
corn
from
alexandria
to
constantinople
this
was
a
charge
which
touched
constantine
very
closely
because
constantinople
depended
very
much
on
the
egyptian
corn
for
food
and
he
thought
that
the
bishop
who
had
so
much
power
at
alexandria
might
perhaps
be
able
to
stop
the
fleet
and
to
starve
the
people
of
the
capital
if
he
pleased
and
whether
the
emperor
believed
the
story
or
whether
he
wished
to
shelter
athanasius
for
a
while
from
his
persecutors
by
putting
him
out
of
the
way
he
sent
him
into
banishment
at
treves
on
the
banks
of
the
moselle
in
a
part
of
gaul
which
is
now
reckoned
to
belong
to
germany
except
for
the
separation
from
his
flock
this
banishment
would
have
been
no
great
hardship
for
athanasius
for
he
was
treated
with
great
respect
by
the
bishop
of
treves
and
by
the
emperor
eldest
son
who
lived
there
and
all
good
men
honoured
him
for
his
stedfastness
in
upholding
the
true
faith
but
although
athanasius
was
removed
the
alexandrian
church
would
not
admit
arius
so
after
a
while
the
emperor
resolved
to
have
him
admitted
at
constantinople
and
a
council
of
bishops
agreed
that
it
should
be
so
the
bishop
of
constantinople
whose
name
was
alexander
and
who
was
almost
a
hundred
years
old
was
grievously
distressed
at
this
he
desired
his
people
to
entreat
god
with
fasting
and
prayer
that
it
might
not
come
to
pass
and
he
threw
himself
under
the
altar
and
prayed
very
earnestly
that
the
evil
which
was
threatened
might
be
somehow
turned
away
or
that
at
least
he
himself
might
not
live
to
see
it
at
length
on
the
evening
before
the
day
which
had
been
fixed
for
receiving
arius
into
the
church
he
was
going
through
the
streets
of
constantinople
in
high
spirits
and
talking
with
some
friends
of
what
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
but
all
at
once
he
felt
himself
ill
and
went
into
a
house
which
was
near
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
dead
his
death
taking
place
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
way
made
a
great
impression
and
people
were
ready
enough
to
look
on
it
as
a
direct
judgment
of
god
on
his
impiety
but
athanasius
although
he
felt
the
awfulness
of
the
unhappy
man
sudden
end
did
not
take
it
on
himself
to
speak
in
this
way
and
we
too
shall
do
well
not
to
pronounce
judgment
in
such
cases
remembering
what
our
lord
said
as
to
the
galileans
who
were
slain
by
pilate
and
as
to
the
men
who
were
killed
by
the
falling
of
the
tower
in
siloam
xiii
while
we
abhor
the
errors
of
arius
let
us
leave
the
judgment
of
him
to
god
although
constantine
in
his
last
years
was
very
much
in
the
hands
of
the
arians
we
must
not
suppose
that
he
meant
to
favour
their
heresy
for
these
people
as
i
have
said
already
and
shall
have
occasion
to
say
again
were
very
crafty
and
took
great
pains
to
hide
the
worst
of
their
opinions
they
used
words
which
sounded
quite
right
except
to
the
few
persons
who
like
athanasius
were
quick
enough
to
understand
what
bad
meanings
might
be
disguised
under
these
fair
words
and
whenever
they
wished
to
get
one
of
the
faithful
bishops
turned
out
they
took
care
not
to
attack
him
about
his
faith
but
about
some
other
things
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
athanasius
thus
they
managed
to
blind
the
emperor
who
did
not
know
much
about
the
matter
so
that
while
they
were
using
him
as
a
tool
and
were
persuading
him
to
help
them
with
all
his
power
he
all
the
while
fancied
that
he
was
firmly
maintaining
the
nicene
faith
constantine
after
all
that
he
had
done
in
religious
disputes
was
still
unbaptized
perhaps
he
was
a
which
as
has
been
explained
before
was
the
name
given
to
persons
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
a
course
of
training
for
baptism
but
it
is
not
certain
that
he
was
even
so
much
as
a
catechumen
at
last
shortly
after
the
death
of
arius
the
emperor
felt
himself
very
sick
and
believed
that
his
end
was
near
he
sent
for
some
bishops
and
told
them
that
he
had
put
off
his
baptism
because
he
had
wished
to
receive
it
in
the
river
jordan
like
our
lord
himself
but
as
god
had
not
granted
him
this
he
begged
that
they
would
baptize
him
he
was
baptized
accordingly
and
during
the
remaining
days
of
his
life
he
refused
to
wear
any
other
robes
than
the
white
dress
which
used
then
to
be
put
on
at
baptism
by
way
of
signifying
the
cleansing
of
the
soul
from
sin
and
thus
the
first
christian
emperor
died
at
a
palace
near
nicomedia
on
whitsunday
in
the
year
page
part
ii
at
constantine
death
the
empire
was
divided
between
his
three
sons
the
eldest
of
them
whose
name
was
the
same
with
his
father
and
the
youngest
constans
were
friendly
to
the
true
faith
but
the
second
son
constantius
was
won
over
by
the
arians
and
as
through
the
death
of
his
brothers
he
got
possession
of
the
whole
empire
within
a
few
years
his
connexion
with
that
party
led
to
great
mischief
all
through
his
reign
there
were
unceasing
disputes
about
religion
councils
were
almost
continually
sitting
in
one
place
or
another
and
bishops
were
posting
about
to
one
of
them
after
another
at
the
emperor
expense
constantius
did
not
mean
ill
but
he
went
even
further
than
his
father
in
meddling
with
things
which
he
did
not
understand
the
arians
went
on
in
the
same
cunning
way
as
before
i
may
mention
by
way
of
example
the
behaviour
of
leontius
bishop
of
antioch
the
catholics
that
is
to
say
those
who
held
the
faith
which
the
church
throughout
all
the
world
held
used
to
sing
in
church
as
we
do
glory
be
to
the
father
and
to
the
son
and
to
the
holy
ghost
but
the
arians
sang
glory
be
to
the
father
the
son
the
holy
ghost
for
they
did
not
allow
the
second
and
third
persons
to
be
of
the
same
nature
with
the
first
leontius
then
who
was
an
arian
and
yet
did
not
wish
people
to
know
exactly
what
he
was
used
to
mumble
his
words
so
that
nobody
could
make
them
out
until
he
came
to
the
part
in
which
all
parties
agreed
and
then
he
sang
out
loudly
and
clearly
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
is
now
and
ever
shall
be
world
without
end
amen
he
was
an
old
man
and
sometimes
he
would
point
to
his
white
hair
and
say
when
this
snow
melts
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
mud
meaning
that
after
his
death
the
two
parties
would
come
to
open
quarrels
which
he
had
tried
to
prevent
during
his
lifetime
by
such
crafty
behaviour
as
that
which
has
just
been
mentioned
the
word
which
means
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
three
young
emperors
met
shortly
after
their
father
death
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
athanasius
should
be
allowed
to
return
to
alexandria
and
for
this
favour
he
was
chiefly
indebted
to
young
constantine
who
had
known
him
during
his
banishment
at
treves
the
bishop
returned
accordingly
and
was
received
with
great
rejoicing
by
his
flock
but
in
about
three
years
his
enemies
contrived
that
he
should
be
again
turned
out
and
he
was
in
banishment
eight
years
he
was
then
restored
again
but
his
enemies
watched
their
time
and
spared
no
pains
to
get
rid
of
him
one
by
one
they
contrived
to
thrust
out
all
the
chief
bishops
who
would
have
been
inclined
to
take
part
with
him
and
at
length
in
the
beginning
of
constantius
sent
a
general
named
syrianus
to
alexandria
with
orders
to
drive
out
athanasius
the
alexandrians
were
so
much
attached
to
their
great
bishop
that
there
was
a
fear
lest
they
might
prevent
any
open
attempt
against
him
but
syrianus
contrived
to
throw
them
off
their
guard
and
one
night
while
athanasius
was
keeping
watch
with
many
of
his
clergy
and
people
in
one
of
the
churches
as
the
christians
of
those
days
used
to
do
before
their
great
festivals
and
at
other
times
syrianus
suddenly
beset
the
church
with
a
great
number
of
soldiers
and
a
multitude
made
up
of
arians
jews
and
the
heathen
rabble
of
the
city
when
athanasius
heard
the
noise
outside
the
church
he
sat
down
calmly
on
his
throne
and
desired
the
congregation
to
chant
the
hundred
and
psalm
in
which
god
deliverances
of
his
people
in
old
times
are
celebrated
and
the
whole
congregation
joined
in
the
last
part
of
every
verse
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
the
doors
were
shut
but
the
soldiers
forced
them
open
and
rushed
in
and
it
was
a
fearful
sight
to
see
their
drawn
swords
and
their
armour
flashing
by
the
lamplight
in
the
house
of
god
as
they
advanced
up
the
church
many
of
the
congregation
were
trodden
down
or
crushed
to
death
or
pierced
through
with
their
darts
athanasius
stood
calm
in
the
midst
of
all
the
terrible
din
his
clergy
when
they
saw
the
soldiers
pushing
on
towards
the
sanctuary
as
the
part
of
the
church
was
called
which
was
railed
off
for
the
clergy
entreated
him
to
save
himself
by
flight
but
he
declared
that
he
would
not
go
until
his
people
were
safe
and
waited
until
most
of
them
had
made
their
escape
through
doors
in
the
upper
part
of
the
church
at
last
when
the
soldiers
were
pressing
very
close
to
the
sanctuary
the
clergy
closed
round
their
bishop
and
hurried
him
away
by
a
secret
passage
and
when
they
had
got
him
out
of
the
church
they
found
that
he
had
fainted
for
although
his
courage
was
high
his
body
was
weak
and
delicate
and
the
dreadful
scene
had
overcome
him
but
he
escaped
to
the
deserts
of
egypt
where
he
lived
in
peace
among
the
monks
for
six
years
until
the
death
of
constantius
his
enemies
thought
that
he
might
perhaps
seek
a
refuge
in
ethiopia
and
constantius
wrote
to
beg
that
the
princes
of
that
country
would
not
shelter
him
and
that
the
bishop
frumentius
might
be
sent
to
receive
instruction
in
the
faith
from
the
arian
bishop
who
was
put
into
the
see
of
alexandria
but
athanasius
was
safe
elsewhere
and
frumentius
wisely
stayed
at
home
see
page
the
new
arian
bishop
of
alexandria
was
a
cappadocian
named
george
he
was
a
coarse
ignorant
and
violent
man
and
behaved
with
great
cruelty
to
athanasius
friends
even
putting
many
of
them
to
death
but
athanasius
from
his
quiet
retreat
kept
a
watch
over
all
that
was
done
as
to
the
affairs
of
the
church
both
at
alexandria
and
elsewhere
and
from
time
to
time
he
wrote
books
which
reached
places
where
he
himself
could
not
venture
to
appear
so
that
although
he
was
not
seen
during
these
years
he
made
himself
felt
both
to
the
confusion
of
the
arians
and
to
the
comfort
and
encouragement
of
the
faithful
part
iii
constantius
had
no
children
and
after
the
death
of
constans
his
nearest
male
relation
was
a
cousin
named
julian
the
emperor
gave
his
sister
in
marriage
to
this
cousin
and
also
gave
him
the
government
of
a
part
of
the
empire
but
he
always
treated
him
with
distrust
and
jealousy
so
that
julian
never
loved
him
and
this
was
not
the
worst
of
it
for
julian
who
had
lost
his
father
when
he
was
very
young
and
had
been
brought
up
under
the
direction
of
constantius
took
a
strong
dislike
to
his
cousin
religion
which
was
forced
on
him
in
a
way
that
a
lively
boy
could
not
well
be
expected
to
relish
he
was
obliged
to
spend
a
great
part
of
his
time
in
attending
the
services
of
the
church
and
was
even
made
a
which
was
one
of
the
lowest
kinds
of
ministers
in
the
church
of
those
times
and
unfortunately
the
end
of
all
this
was
that
instead
of
being
truly
religious
he
learnt
to
be
a
hypocrite
when
he
grew
older
and
was
left
more
to
himself
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
heathen
philosophers
who
were
very
glad
to
get
hold
of
a
prince
who
might
one
day
be
emperor
so
julian
mind
was
poisoned
with
their
opinions
and
he
gave
up
all
belief
in
the
gospel
although
he
continued
to
profess
himself
a
christian
for
nine
years
longer
on
account
of
his
having
thus
forsaken
the
faith
he
is
commonly
called
the
at
length
when
julian
was
at
paris
early
in
the
year
constantius
sent
him
some
orders
which
neither
he
nor
his
soldiers
were
disposed
to
obey
the
soldiers
lifted
him
up
on
a
shield
and
proclaimed
him
emperor
and
julian
set
out
at
their
head
to
fight
for
the
throne
he
marched
boldly
eastward
until
he
came
to
the
danube
then
he
embarked
his
troops
and
descended
the
great
river
for
many
hundreds
of
miles
into
the
country
which
is
now
called
hungary
constantius
left
antioch
and
was
marching
to
meet
julian
army
when
he
was
taken
ill
and
died
at
a
little
town
in
cilicia
like
his
father
he
was
baptized
only
a
day
or
two
before
his
death
julian
now
came
into
possession
of
the
empire
without
further
dispute
and
he
did
all
that
he
could
to
set
heathenism
up
again
but
in
many
parts
of
the
empire
christianity
had
taken
such
root
that
very
few
of
the
people
held
to
the
old
religion
or
wished
to
see
it
restored
thus
we
are
told
that
once
when
the
emperor
went
to
a
famous
temple
near
antioch
on
a
great
heathen
festival
in
the
hope
of
finding
things
carried
on
as
they
had
been
before
constantine
time
only
one
old
priest
was
to
be
seen
and
instead
of
the
costly
sacrifices
which
had
been
offered
in
the
former
days
of
heathenism
the
poor
old
man
had
nothing
better
than
a
single
goose
to
offer
julian
knew
that
in
past
times
christians
had
always
been
ready
to
suffer
for
their
faith
and
that
the
patience
of
the
martyrs
had
always
led
to
the
increase
of
the
church
he
did
not
think
it
wise
therefore
to
go
to
work
in
the
same
way
as
the
earlier
persecuting
emperors
but
he
contrived
to
annoy
the
christians
very
much
by
other
means
and
sometimes
great
cruelties
were
committed
against
them
under
his
authority
yet
with
all
this
he
pretended
to
allow
them
the
exercise
of
their
religion
and
he
gave
leave
to
those
who
had
been
banished
by
constantius
to
return
home
not
that
he
really
meant
to
do
them
any
kindness
but
because
he
hoped
that
they
would
all
fall
to
quarrelling
among
themselves
and
that
he
should
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
their
quarrels
but
in
this
hope
he
was
happily
disappointed
for
they
had
learnt
wisdom
by
suffering
and
were
disposed
to
make
peace
with
each
other
as
much
as
possible
while
they
were
all
threatened
by
the
enemies
of
the
saviour
very
name
the
first
thing
that
the
heathens
of
alexandria
did
when
they
heard
of
the
death
of
constantius
had
been
to
kill
the
arian
bishop
george
for
he
had
behaved
in
such
a
way
that
the
heathens
hated
him
even
more
than
the
catholics
did
another
arian
bishop
was
set
up
in
his
place
but
when
julian
had
given
leave
for
the
banished
to
return
athanasius
came
back
and
the
arian
was
turned
out
the
alexandrians
received
athanasius
with
great
joy
and
he
did
all
that
was
in
his
power
to
reconcile
the
parties
of
christians
among
themselves
for
although
no
one
could
be
more
earnest
than
he
in
maintaining
every
particle
of
the
faith
necessary
for
a
true
christian
he
was
careful
not
to
insist
on
things
which
were
not
necessary
he
knew
too
that
people
who
really
meant
alike
were
often
divided
from
each
other
by
not
understanding
one
another
words
and
he
was
always
ready
to
make
allowance
for
them
as
far
as
he
could
do
so
without
giving
up
the
truth
but
julian
was
afraid
to
let
him
remain
at
alexandria
and
was
greatly
provoked
at
hearing
that
he
had
converted
and
baptized
some
heathen
ladies
of
rank
so
the
emperor
wrote
to
the
alexandrians
telling
them
that
although
they
might
choose
another
bishop
for
themselves
they
must
not
let
athanasius
remain
among
them
and
banishing
the
bishop
from
all
egypt
athanasius
when
he
heard
of
this
said
to
his
friends
let
us
withdraw
this
is
but
a
little
cloud
which
will
soon
pass
over
and
he
set
off
up
the
river
nile
in
a
boat
after
a
while
another
boat
was
seen
in
pursuit
of
him
but
athanasius
then
told
his
boatmen
to
turn
round
and
to
sail
down
the
river
again
and
when
they
met
the
other
boat
from
which
they
had
not
been
seen
until
after
turning
they
answered
the
questions
of
its
crew
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
allowed
to
pass
without
being
suspected
of
having
the
bishop
on
board
thus
athanasius
got
safe
back
to
the
city
and
there
he
lay
hid
securely
while
his
enemies
were
searching
for
him
elsewhere
but
after
a
little
time
he
withdrew
to
the
deserts
where
he
was
welcomed
and
sheltered
by
his
old
friends
the
monks
in
his
hatred
of
christianity
julian
not
only
tried
to
restore
heathenism
but
showed
favour
to
the
jews
he
sent
for
some
of
them
and
asked
why
they
did
not
offer
sacrifice
as
their
law
had
ordered
they
answered
that
it
was
not
lawful
to
sacrifice
except
in
the
temple
of
jerusalem
which
was
now
in
ruins
and
did
not
belong
to
them
so
that
they
could
no
longer
fulfil
the
duty
of
sacrificing
julian
then
gave
them
leave
to
build
the
temple
up
again
and
the
jews
came
together
in
vast
numbers
from
the
different
countries
into
which
they
had
been
scattered
many
of
them
had
got
great
wealth
in
the
lands
of
their
banishment
and
it
is
said
that
even
the
women
laboured
at
the
work
carrying
earth
in
their
rich
silken
dresses
and
that
tools
of
silver
were
used
in
the
building
the
jews
were
full
of
triumph
at
the
thought
of
being
restored
to
their
own
land
and
of
reviving
the
greatness
of
david
and
solomon
but
it
had
been
declared
that
the
temple
was
to
be
overthrown
and
that
jerusalem
was
to
be
trodden
down
of
the
gentiles
on
account
of
the
sin
of
god
ancient
people
xxi
so
that
this
undertaking
to
rebuild
the
temple
was
nothing
less
than
a
daring
defiance
of
him
who
had
so
spoken
and
it
pleased
him
to
defeat
it
in
a
terrible
manner
an
earthquake
scattered
the
foundations
which
had
been
laid
balls
of
fire
burst
forth
from
the
ground
scorching
and
killing
many
of
the
workmen
their
tools
were
melted
by
lightning
and
stories
are
told
of
other
fearful
sights
which
put
an
end
to
the
attempt
julian
indeed
meant
to
set
about
it
once
more
after
returning
from
a
war
which
he
had
undertaken
against
the
persians
but
he
never
lived
to
do
so
athanasius
was
not
mistaken
when
he
said
that
his
heathen
emperor
tyranny
would
be
only
as
a
passing
cloud
for
julian
reign
lasted
little
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
in
all
he
led
his
army
into
persia
in
the
spring
of
and
in
june
of
that
year
he
was
killed
in
a
skirmish
by
night
julian
left
no
child
to
succeed
him
in
the
empire
and
the
army
chose
as
his
successor
a
christian
named
jovian
who
soon
undid
all
that
julian
had
done
in
matters
of
religion
the
new
emperor
invited
athanasius
to
visit
him
at
antioch
and
took
his
advice
as
to
the
restoration
of
the
true
faith
but
jovian
reign
lasted
only
eight
months
and
valentinian
who
was
then
made
emperor
gave
the
empire
of
the
east
to
his
brother
valens
who
was
a
furious
arian
and
treated
the
catholics
with
great
cruelty
we
are
told
for
instance
that
when
eighty
of
their
bishops
had
carried
a
petition
to
him
he
put
them
on
board
a
ship
and
when
it
had
got
out
to
sea
the
sailors
by
his
orders
set
it
on
fire
and
made
their
escape
in
boats
leaving
the
poor
bishops
to
be
burned
to
death
valens
turned
many
orthodox
bishops
that
is
to
say
bishops
the
right
out
of
their
sees
and
meant
to
turn
out
athanasius
who
hid
himself
for
a
while
in
his
father
tomb
but
the
people
of
alexandria
begged
earnestly
that
their
bishop
might
be
allowed
to
remain
with
them
and
the
emperor
did
not
think
it
safe
to
deny
their
request
lest
there
should
be
some
outbreak
in
the
city
and
thus
while
the
faith
of
which
athanasius
had
so
long
been
the
chief
defender
and
for
the
sake
of
which
he
had
borne
so
much
was
under
persecution
in
all
other
parts
of
the
eastern
empire
the
great
bishop
of
alexandria
was
allowed
to
spend
his
last
years
among
his
own
flock
without
disturbance
he
died
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
chapter
xiii
the
monks
in
the
story
of
athanasius
have
been
more
than
once
mentioned
and
it
is
now
time
to
give
some
account
of
these
people
and
of
their
ways
the
word
properly
means
one
who
leads
a
life
and
the
name
was
given
to
persons
who
professed
to
withdraw
from
the
world
and
its
business
that
they
might
give
themselves
up
to
serve
god
in
religious
thoughts
and
exercises
among
the
jews
there
had
been
whole
classes
of
people
who
practised
this
sort
of
retirement
some
called
lived
near
the
dead
sea
and
others
called
in
egypt
where
a
great
number
of
jews
had
settled
among
the
heathens
of
the
east
too
a
like
manner
of
living
had
been
common
for
ages
as
it
still
continues
to
be
and
many
of
them
carry
it
to
an
excessive
strictness
as
we
are
told
by
travellers
who
have
visited
india
thibet
and
other
countries
of
asia
nothing
of
the
kind
however
is
commanded
for
christians
in
the
new
testament
and
when
scripture
warrant
for
the
monkish
life
was
sought
for
the
great
patterns
who
were
produced
were
elijah
and
john
the
baptist
the
one
of
them
an
old
testament
prophet
the
other
a
holy
man
who
lived
indeed
in
the
days
when
our
lord
himself
was
on
the
earth
but
who
was
not
allowed
to
enter
into
his
church
or
to
see
it
fully
established
by
the
coming
of
the
holy
ghost
at
the
day
of
pentecost
but
still
it
was
very
natural
that
the
notion
of
a
life
of
strict
poverty
retirement
from
the
world
and
employment
in
spiritual
things
should
find
favour
with
christians
as
a
means
of
fulfilling
the
duties
of
their
holy
calling
and
so
it
seems
that
some
of
them
took
to
this
way
of
life
very
early
but
the
first
who
is
named
as
a
that
is
to
say
a
in
the
was
paul
a
young
man
of
alexandria
who
in
the
year
fled
from
the
persecution
of
decius
into
the
egyptian
desert
where
he
is
said
to
have
lived
ninety
years
paul
although
he
afterwards
became
very
famous
spent
his
days
without
being
known
until
just
before
his
death
he
was
visited
by
another
great
hermit
antony
but
antony
himself
was
a
person
of
great
note
and
importance
in
his
own
lifetime
he
was
born
in
the
district
of
thebes
in
egypt
in
the
very
same
year
that
paul
withdrew
from
the
world
while
a
boy
he
was
thoughtful
and
serious
his
parents
died
before
he
had
reached
the
age
of
twenty
and
left
him
considerable
wealth
one
day
when
in
church
he
was
struck
by
hearing
the
story
of
the
rich
young
man
who
was
charged
to
sell
all
that
he
had
give
to
the
poor
and
follow
our
lord
xviii
at
another
time
he
was
moved
by
hearing
the
charge
to
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
vi
and
in
order
to
obey
these
commands
as
he
thought
antony
parted
with
all
that
belonged
to
him
bade
farewell
to
his
only
sister
and
left
his
home
with
the
intention
of
living
in
loneliness
and
devotion
he
carried
on
this
life
for
many
years
and
several
times
changed
his
abode
that
he
might
seek
out
some
place
still
wilder
and
more
remote
than
the
last
but
he
grew
so
famous
that
people
flocked
even
into
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
to
see
him
a
number
of
disciples
gathered
around
him
and
hermits
or
monks
began
to
copy
his
way
of
life
in
other
parts
of
egypt
antony
influence
became
very
great
he
made
peace
between
enemies
comforted
mourners
and
gave
advice
to
all
who
asked
him
as
to
spiritual
concerns
and
when
he
took
the
part
of
any
oppressed
person
who
applied
to
him
his
interference
was
always
successful
affairs
of
this
kind
sometimes
obliged
him
to
leave
his
as
the
dwellings
of
the
monks
were
called
but
he
always
returned
as
soon
as
possible
for
he
used
to
say
that
a
monk
out
of
his
solitude
is
like
a
fish
out
of
water
even
the
emperors
constantine
and
his
sons
wrote
to
him
with
great
respect
and
asked
him
to
visit
their
courts
he
thanked
them
but
did
not
accept
their
invitation
and
he
wrote
more
than
once
to
them
in
favour
of
athanasius
whom
he
steadily
supported
in
his
troubles
on
account
of
the
faith
on
two
great
occasions
he
visited
alexandria
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
his
brethren
in
their
sufferings
for
the
truth
the
first
of
these
visits
was
while
the
last
heathen
persecution
under
maximin
was
raging
antony
stood
by
the
martyrs
at
their
trials
and
in
their
death
and
took
all
opportunities
of
declaring
himself
a
christian
but
the
persecutors
did
not
venture
to
touch
him
and
after
waiting
till
the
heat
of
the
danger
was
past
he
again
withdrew
to
the
wilderness
the
second
visit
was
in
the
time
of
the
arian
disturbances
when
his
appearance
had
even
a
greater
effect
than
before
the
catholics
were
encouraged
by
his
exhortations
and
a
great
number
of
conversions
took
place
in
consequence
antony
died
at
the
age
of
a
hundred
and
five
in
the
year
a
few
days
before
the
great
bishop
of
alexandria
was
driven
to
seek
a
refuge
in
the
desert
see

antony
as
we
have
seen
was
a
living
in
the
wilderness
by
himself
but
other
kinds
of
monks
were
established
who
lived
in
companies
together
sometimes
they
were
lodged
in
clusters
of
little
cells
each
of
them
having
his
separate
cell
or
two
or
three
living
together
sometimes
the
cells
were
all
in
one
large
building
called
a
the
head
of
each
monastery
or
of
each
cluster
of
cells
was
called
which
means
and
in
some
cases
there
were
many
monasteries
belonging
to
one
so
that
they
were
all
considered
as
one
society
and
there
was
one
chief
abbot
over
all
thus
the
order
founded
by
pachomius
on
an
island
in
the
nile
soon
spread
so
that
before
his
death
it
had
eight
monasteries
with
three
thousand
monks
among
them
and
about
fifty
years
later
it
had
no
fewer
than
fifty
thousand
monks
these
monks
of
pachomius
lived
in
cells
each
of
which
contained
three
each
cluster
of
cells
had
its
abbot
the
head
of
the
order
who
was
called
the
which
means
of
a
went
round
occasionally
to
visit
all
the
societies
which
were
under
him
and
the
whole
order
met
every
year
at
the
chief
monastery
for
the
festival
of
easter
and
a
second
time
in
the
month
of
august
the
monks
of
pachomius
prayed
many
times
they
fasted
every
wednesday
and
friday
and
communicated
every
sunday
and
saturday
they
took
their
meals
together
and
sang
psalms
before
each
they
were
not
allowed
to
talk
at
table
but
sat
with
their
hoods
drawn
over
their
faces
so
that
no
one
could
see
his
neighbours
or
anything
but
the
food
before
him
their
dress
was
coarse
and
plain
the
chief
article
of
it
was
a
rough
in
imitation
of
the
prophet
elijah
they
slept
with
their
clothes
on
not
in
beds
but
in
chairs
which
were
of
such
a
shape
as
to
keep
them
almost
standing
they
spent
their
time
not
only
in
prayers
and
other
religious
exercises
but
in
various
kinds
of
simple
work
such
as
labouring
in
the
fields
weaving
baskets
ropes
and
nets
or
making
shoes
they
had
boats
in
which
they
sent
the
produce
of
their
labour
down
the
nile
to
alexandria
and
the
money
which
they
got
by
selling
it
was
not
only
enough
to
keep
them
but
enabled
them
to
redeem
captives
and
to
do
such
other
acts
of
charity
this
account
of
the
monks
of
pachomius
will
give
some
notion
of
the
monkish
life
in
general
although
one
order
differed
from
another
in
various
ways
all
that
the
monks
had
was
considered
to
belong
to
them
in
common
after
the
pattern
of
the
first
christians
as
was
supposed
ii
iv
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
have
anything
of
his
own
thus
we
are
told
that
when
a
monk
was
found
at
his
death
to
have
left
a
hundred
pieces
of
silver
which
he
had
earned
by
weaving
flax
his
brethren
who
were
about
three
thousand
in
number
met
to
consider
what
should
be
done
with
the
money
some
were
for
giving
it
to
the
church
some
to
the
poor
but
the
fathers
of
the
society
quoted
peter
words
to
simon
the
sorcerer
thy
money
perish
with
thee
viii
and
on
the
strength
of
this
text
which
in
truth
had
not
much
to
do
with
the
matter
they
ordered
that
it
should
be
buried
with
its
late
owner
jerome
who
tells
the
story
says
that
this
was
not
done
out
of
any
wish
to
condemn
the
dead
monk
but
in
order
that
others
might
be
deterred
from
hoarding
these
different
kinds
of
monks
were
first
established
in
various
parts
of
egypt
but
their
way
of
life
was
soon
taken
up
in
other
countries
and
societies
of
women
who
were
called
that
is
to
say
were
formed
under
the
same
kind
of
rules
one
thing
which
had
much
to
do
with
making
monkish
life
so
common
was
that
when
persecution
by
the
heathen
was
at
an
end
many
christians
felt
the
want
of
something
which
might
assure
them
that
they
were
separate
from
the
world
as
christ
true
people
ought
to
be
it
was
no
longer
enough
that
they
should
call
themselves
christians
for
the
world
had
come
to
call
itself
christian
too
perhaps
we
may
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
those
who
wished
to
live
religiously
had
tried
to
go
on
doing
their
duty
in
the
world
and
to
improve
it
by
the
example
and
the
influence
of
holy
and
charitable
lives
instead
of
running
away
from
it
and
they
were
certainly
much
mistaken
if
they
fancied
that
by
hiding
themselves
in
the
desert
they
were
likely
to
escape
temptation
for
temptations
followed
them
into
their
retreats
and
we
have
only
too
many
proofs
in
the
accounts
of
famous
monks
that
the
effect
of
this
mistake
was
often
very
sad
indeed
and
we
may
be
sure
that
if
the
good
men
who
in
those
days
were
active
in
recommending
the
life
of
monks
had
been
able
to
foresee
how
things
would
turn
out
they
would
have
been
much
more
cautious
in
what
they
said
of
it
it
was
not
every
one
who
was
fit
for
such
a
life
and
many
took
it
up
without
rightly
considering
whether
they
fit
for
it
the
kind
of
work
which
was
provided
for
them
was
not
enough
to
occupy
them
thoroughly
and
many
of
them
suffered
grievously
from
temptations
to
which
their
idleness
laid
them
open
it
was
supposed
indeed
that
they
might
find
the
thoughts
of
heavenly
things
enough
to
fill
their
minds
and
when
a
philosopher
asked
antony
how
he
could
live
without
books
he
answered
that
for
him
the
whole
creation
was
a
book
always
at
hand
in
which
he
could
read
god
word
whenever
he
pleased
but
it
was
not
every
one
who
could
find
such
delight
in
that
great
book
and
many
of
the
monks
for
want
of
employment
were
tormented
by
all
sorts
of
evil
thoughts
nay
some
of
them
were
even
driven
into
madness
by
their
way
of
life
the
monks
ran
into
very
strange
mistakes
as
to
their
duty
towards
their
kindred
even
antony
himself
although
he
was
free
from
many
of
the
faults
of
spiritual
pride
and
the
like
which
became
too
common
among
his
followers
thought
himself
bound
to
overcome
his
love
for
his
young
sister
and
as
another
sample
of
the
way
in
which
monks
were
expected
to
deaden
their
natural
affections
i
may
tell
you
how
his
disciple
pior
behaved
pior
when
a
youth
left
his
father
house
and
vowed
that
he
would
never
again
look
on
any
of
his
relations
which
was
surely
a
very
rash
and
foolish
and
wrong
vow
he
went
into
the
desert
and
had
lived
there
fifty
years
when
his
sister
heard
that
he
was
still
alive
she
was
too
infirm
to
go
in
search
of
him
but
she
contrived
that
the
abbot
under
whose
authority
he
was
should
order
him
to
pay
her
a
visit
pior
went
accordingly
and
when
he
had
reached
her
house
he
stood
in
front
of
it
and
sent
to
tell
her
that
he
was
there
the
poor
old
woman
made
all
haste
to
get
to
him
her
heart
was
full
of
love
and
delight
at
the
thoughts
of
seeing
her
brother
again
after
so
long
a
separation
but
as
soon
as
pior
heard
the
door
opening
he
shut
his
eyes
and
he
kept
them
shut
all
through
the
meeting
he
refused
to
go
into
his
sister
house
and
when
he
had
let
her
see
him
for
a
short
time
in
this
way
without
showing
her
any
token
of
kindness
he
hurried
back
to
the
desert
in
later
times
monks
were
usually
ordained
as
clergy
of
the
church
but
at
first
it
was
not
intended
that
they
should
be
so
and
in
each
monastery
there
were
only
so
many
clergy
as
were
needed
for
the
performance
of
divine
service
and
other
works
of
the
ministry
and
in
those
early
days
many
monks
had
a
great
fear
of
being
ordained
clergymen
or
bishops
because
they
thought
that
the
active
business
in
which
bishops
and
other
clergy
were
obliged
to
engage
would
hinder
their
reaching
to
the
higher
degrees
of
holiness
thus
a
famous
monk
named
ammonius
on
being
chosen
for
a
bishopric
cut
off
one
of
his
ears
thinking
that
this
blemish
would
prevent
his
being
made
a
priest
as
it
would
have
done
under
the
law
of
moses
xxi
and
when
he
was
told
that
it
was
not
so
in
the
christian
church
he
threatened
to
cut
out
his
tongue
it
was
not
long
before
the
sight
of
the
great
respect
which
was
paid
to
the
monks
led
many
worthless
people
to
call
themselves
monks
for
the
sake
of
what
they
might
get
by
doing
so
these
fellows
used
to
go
about
wearing
heavy
chains
uncouthly
dressed
and
behaving
roughly
and
they
told
outrageous
stories
of
visions
and
of
fights
with
devils
which
they
pretended
to
have
had
by
such
tricks
they
got
large
sums
of
money
from
people
who
were
foolish
enough
to
encourage
them
and
they
spent
it
in
the
most
shameful
ways
but
besides
these
vile
hypocrites
many
monks
who
seem
to
have
been
sincere
enough
ran
into
very
strange
extravagances
there
was
one
kind
of
them
called
who
used
to
live
among
mountains
without
any
roof
to
shelter
them
browsing
like
beasts
on
grass
and
herbs
and
by
degrees
growing
much
more
like
beasts
than
men
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
one
symeon
founded
a
new
sort
of
monks
who
were
called
that
is
to
say
from
a
greek
word
which
means
a
pillar
symeon
was
a
syrian
and
lived
on
the
top
of
one
pillar
after
another
for
years
each
pillar
was
higher
than
the
one
before
it
the
height
of
the
last
of
them
was
forty
cubits
or
seventy
feet
and
the
top
of
it
was
only
a
yard
across
there
symeon
was
to
be
seen
with
a
heavy
iron
chain
round
his
neck
and
great
numbers
of
people
flocked
to
visit
him
some
of
them
even
went
all
the
way
from
our
own
country
and
when
he
was
dead
a
monk
named
daniel
got
the
old
cowl
which
he
had
worn
and
built
himself
a
pillar
near
constantinople
where
he
lived
years
the
high
winds
sometimes
almost
blew
him
from
his
place
and
sometimes
he
was
covered
for
days
with
snow
and
ice
until
the
emperor
leo
made
him
submit
to
let
a
shed
be
built
round
the
top
of
his
pillar
the
fame
and
influence
which
these
monks
gained
were
immense
they
were
supposed
to
have
the
power
of
prophecy
and
of
miracles
they
were
consulted
even
by
emperors
and
kings
in
the
most
important
matters
and
sometimes
on
great
occasions
when
a
stylite
descended
from
his
pillar
or
some
famous
hermit
left
his
cell
and
appeared
among
the
crowds
of
a
city
he
was
able
to
make
everything
bend
to
his
will
we
must
not
be
blind
to
the
serious
errors
of
monkery
but
we
are
bound
also
to
own
that
god
was
pleased
to
make
it
the
means
of
great
good
the
monks
did
much
for
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
and
when
the
ages
of
darkness
came
on
after
the
overthrow
of
the
roman
empire
in
the
west
they
rendered
inestimable
service
in
preserving
the
knowledge
of
learning
and
religion
which
but
for
them
might
have
utterly
perished
from
the
earth
chapter
xiv
st
basil
and
gregory
of
nazianzum
council
of
constantinople
part
although
athanasius
was
now
dead
god
did
not
fail
to
raise
up
champions
for
the
true
faith
three
of
the
most
famous
of
these
were
natives
of
cappadocia
namely
basil
his
brother
gregory
of
nyssa
and
his
friend
gregory
of
nazianzum
but
although
gregory
of
nyssa
was
a
very
good
and
learned
man
and
did
great
service
to
the
truth
by
his
writings
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
story
of
his
life
so
i
shall
only
tell
you
about
the
other
two
basil
and
gregory
of
nazianzum
were
both
born
about
the
year
basil
was
of
a
noble
christian
family
gregory
father
had
belonged
to
a
strange
sect
called
hypsistarians
whose
religion
was
a
mixture
of
jewish
and
heathen
notions
but
he
had
been
converted
from
it
by
his
wife
nonna
who
was
a
very
pious
and
excellent
woman
and
before
his
son
birth
he
had
risen
to
be
bishop
of
nazianzum
the
two
youths
became
acquainted
at
school
in
cappadocia
and
when
they
were
afterwards
sent
to
the
famous
schools
of
athens
they
grew
into
the
closest
friendship
they
lived
and
read
and
walked
together
gregory
says
that
they
had
all
things
common
and
that
it
was
as
if
they
had
only
one
soul
in
two
bodies
athens
was
an
excellent
place
for
learning
all
that
the
wise
men
of
this
world
could
teach
and
therefore
students
flocked
to
it
from
distant
countries
but
it
was
a
dangerous
place
for
christian
young
men
for
the
teachers
were
heathen
philosophers
and
knew
well
how
to
entangle
them
in
arguments
so
that
many
of
the
pupils
who
did
not
rightly
understand
the
grounds
of
their
faith
were
deceived
into
giving
it
up
thus
at
the
very
time
when
basil
and
gregory
were
at
athens
julian
was
also
there
sucking
in
the
heathen
notions
which
led
to
so
much
evil
when
he
afterwards
became
emperor
but
the
two
cappadocians
kept
themselves
clear
from
all
the
snares
of
philosophy
and
vain
deceit
ii
and
although
they
were
the
foremost
of
all
the
students
in
athens
for
learning
and
might
have
hoped
to
make
a
great
figure
in
the
world
by
their
talents
they
resolved
to
give
up
all
worldly
ambition
and
to
devote
themselves
to
the
ministry
of
the
church
so
they
were
both
ordained
to
be
clergymen
and
their
friendship
continued
as
warm
as
ever
gregory
did
many
kind
offices
to
basil
and
at
length
when
the
archbishopric
of
cæsarea
the
chief
city
of
cappadocia
fell
vacant
gregory
had
a
great
share
in
getting
his
friend
chosen
to
it
basil
was
now
in
a
very
high
office
with
many
bishops
under
him
and
he
had
become
noted
as
one
of
the
chief
defenders
of
the
catholic
faith
and
when
the
emperor
valens
set
up
arianism
in
all
other
parts
of
his
dominions
basil
remained
at
his
post
and
kept
the
church
of
cæsarea
free
from
the
heresy
valens
came
into
cappadocia
and
was
angry
that
while
his
wishes
were
obeyed
everywhere
else
basil
should
hold
out
against
them
so
he
sent
an
officer
named
modestus
to
cæsarea
and
ordered
him
to
require
the
archbishop
to
submit
on
pain
of
being
turned
out
modestus
told
basil
his
errand
and
threatened
him
with
loss
of
his
property
torture
banishment
and
even
death
in
case
of
his
refusal
but
basil
was
not
at
all
daunted
think
of
some
other
threat
he
said
for
these
have
no
influence
on
me
as
for
loss
of
property
i
run
no
risk
for
i
have
nothing
to
lose
except
these
mean
garments
and
a
few
books
nor
does
a
christian
care
for
banishment
since
he
has
no
home
upon
earth
but
makes
every
country
his
own
or
rather
he
looks
on
the
whole
world
as
god
and
on
himself
as
god
pilgrim
upon
earth
neither
can
tortures
harm
me
for
my
body
is
so
weak
that
the
first
blow
would
kill
me
and
death
would
be
a
gain
for
it
would
but
send
me
the
sooner
to
him
for
whom
i
live
and
labour
and
to
whom
i
have
long
been
journeying
modestus
returned
to
his
master
with
an
account
of
what
had
been
said
and
valens
himself
soon
after
came
to
cæsarea
but
when
he
went
to
the
cathedral
on
the
festival
of
the
epiphany
and
saw
basil
at
the
head
of
his
clergy
and
witnessed
their
solemn
service
he
was
struck
with
awe
he
wished
to
make
an
offering
as
the
custom
was
but
none
of
the
clergy
went
to
receive
his
gift
and
he
almost
fainted
at
the
thought
of
being
thus
rejected
from
the
church
as
if
he
had
no
part
or
lot
in
it
he
afterwards
sent
for
basil
and
had
some
conversation
with
him
and
the
end
of
the
affair
was
that
he
not
only
left
basil
in
possession
of
his
see
but
bestowed
a
valuable
estate
on
a
hospital
which
the
archbishop
had
lately
founded
while
basil
had
risen
by
gregory
help
to
be
an
archbishop
gregory
himself
was
still
a
presbyter
he
would
not
have
taken
even
this
office
but
that
his
father
ordained
him
to
it
almost
by
force
and
he
had
a
great
dread
of
being
raised
to
the
high
and
difficult
office
of
a
bishop
but
basil
for
certain
reasons
wished
to
establish
a
bishop
in
a
little
town
called
sasima
and
he
fixed
on
his
old
friend
without
perhaps
thinking
so
much
as
he
ought
to
have
thought
whether
the
place
and
the
man
were
likely
to
suit
each
other
the
old
bishop
of
nazianzum
did
all
that
he
could
to
overcome
his
son
unwillingness
and
gregory
was
consecrated
but
he
thought
himself
unkindly
used
and
complained
much
of
basil
behaviour
in
the
matter
after
a
time
basil
and
other
leaders
of
the
orthodox
that
is
of
those
who
the
right
urged
gregory
to
undertake
a
mission
to
constantinople
and
he
agreed
to
go
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
do
some
good
the
bishopric
of
that
great
city
had
been
in
the
hands
of
arians
for
nearly
forty
years
and
although
there
were
many
people
of
other
sects
there
the
orthodox
were
but
a
handful
gregory
when
he
began
his
labours
found
that
there
was
a
strong
feeling
against
him
and
his
doctrine
he
could
not
get
the
use
of
any
church
and
was
obliged
to
hold
his
service
in
a
friend
house
he
was
often
attacked
by
the
arian
mob
he
was
stoned
he
was
carried
before
the
magistrates
on
charges
of
disturbing
the
peace
the
house
which
he
had
turned
into
a
chapel
was
broken
into
by
night
and
shocking
outrages
were
committed
in
it
but
the
good
gregory
held
on
notwithstanding
all
this
and
after
a
while
his
mild
and
grave
character
his
eloquent
and
instructive
preaching
and
the
piety
of
his
life
wrought
a
great
change
so
that
his
little
place
of
worship
became
far
too
small
to
hold
the
crowds
which
flocked
to
it
while
gregory
was
thus
employed
basil
died
in
the
year
part
ii
both
parts
of
the
empire
were
now
again
under
orthodox
princes
valens
had
lost
his
life
in
war
without
leaving
any
children
so
that
valentinian
sons
gratian
and
valentinian
the
second
were
heirs
to
the
whole
but
gratian
felt
the
burden
of
government
too
much
for
himself
a
lad
of
nineteen
and
for
his
little
brother
who
was
but
seven
years
old
and
he
gave
up
the
east
to
a
brave
spaniard
named
theodosius
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
defend
it
theodosius
came
to
constantinople
in
the
year
and
found
things
in
the
state
which
has
just
been
described
he
turned
the
arian
bishop
and
his
clergy
out
of
the
churches
and
gave
gregory
possession
of
the
cathedral
gregory
knew
that
the
emperor
wished
to
help
the
cause
of
the
true
faith
and
he
did
as
theodosius
wished
but
he
was
very
sad
and
uneasy
at
being
thus
thrust
on
a
flock
of
which
the
greater
part
as
yet
refused
to
own
him
theodosius
then
called
a
council
which
met
at
constantinople
in
the
year
and
is
reckoned
as
the
second
general
council
the
council
of
nicæa
having
been
the
first
one
act
of
this
council
was
to
add
to
the
nicene
creed
some
words
about
the
holy
ghost
by
way
of
guarding
against
the
errors
of
a
party
who
were
called
macedonians
after
one
macedonius
who
had
been
bishop
of
constantinople
for
these
people
denied
the
true
doctrine
as
to
the
holy
ghost
although
they
had
given
up
the
errors
of
arius
as
to
the
godhead
of
our
blessed
lord
see
chapter
xi
but
afterwards
some
of
the
bishops
who
attended
the
council
fell
to
disputing
about
the
choice
of
a
bishop
for
antioch
and
gregory
who
tried
to
persuade
them
to
agree
found
that
instead
of
heeding
his
advice
they
all
fell
on
him
and
they
behaved
so
shamefully
to
him
that
he
gave
up
his
bishopric
which
indeed
he
had
before
wished
to
do
theodosius
was
very
sorry
to
lose
so
good
a
man
from
that
important
place
but
gregory
was
glad
to
get
away
from
its
troubles
and
anxieties
to
the
quiet
life
which
he
best
loved
he
took
charge
of
the
diocese
of
nazianzum
which
had
been
vacant
since
his
father
death
some
before
until
a
regular
bishop
was
appointed
to
it
and
he
spent
his
last
days
in
retirement
soothing
himself
with
religious
poetry
and
music
one
of
the
holiest
men
of
our
own
church
bishop
ken
the
author
of
the
morning
and
evening
hymns
used
often
to
compare
himself
with
gregory
of
nazianzum
for
bishop
ken
too
was
driven
from
his
bishopric
in
troubled
times
and
in
the
poverty
sickness
and
sorrow
of
his
last
years
he
too
used
to
find
relief
in
playing
on
his
lute
and
in
writing
hymns
and
other
devout
poems
theodosius
was
resolved
to
establish
the
right
faith
according
as
the
council
had
laid
it
down
but
it
seems
that
at
one
time
some
of
the
bishops
were
afraid
lest
an
arian
named
eunomius
should
get
an
influence
over
his
mind
and
should
persuade
him
to
favour
the
arians
and
there
is
a
curious
story
of
the
way
in
which
one
of
these
bishops
who
was
a
homely
old
man
from
some
retired
little
town
tried
to
show
the
emperor
that
he
ought
not
to
encourage
heretics
on
a
day
when
a
number
of
bishops
went
to
pay
their
respects
at
court
this
old
man
after
having
saluted
the
emperor
very
respectfully
turned
to
his
eldest
son
the
young
emperor
arcadius
and
stroked
his
head
as
if
he
had
been
any
common
boy
theodosius
was
very
angry
at
this
behaviour
and
ordered
that
the
bishop
should
be
turned
out
but
as
the
officers
of
the
palace
were
hurrying
him
towards
the
door
the
old
man
addressed
the
emperor
and
told
him
that
as
was
angry
on
account
of
the
slight
offered
to
the
prince
even
so
would
the
heavenly
father
be
offended
with
those
who
should
refuse
to
his
son
the
honours
which
they
paid
to
himself
theodosius
was
much
struck
by
this
speech
he
begged
the
bishop
forgiveness
and
showed
his
regard
for
the
admonition
by
keeping
eunomius
and
the
rest
of
the
arians
at
a
distance
the
emperor
then
made
some
severe
laws
forbidding
all
sorts
of
sects
to
hold
their
worship
and
requiring
them
to
join
the
catholic
church
now
this
was
no
doubt
a
great
mistake
for
it
is
impossible
to
force
religious
belief
on
people
and
although
christian
princes
ought
to
support
the
true
faith
by
making
laws
in
favour
of
it
it
is
wrong
to
make
men
pretend
a
belief
which
they
do
not
feel
in
their
hearts
but
theodosius
had
not
had
the
same
opportunities
which
we
have
since
had
of
seeing
how
useless
such
laws
are
and
what
mischief
they
generally
do
so
that
instead
of
blaming
him
we
must
give
him
credit
for
acting
in
the
way
which
he
believed
most
likely
to
promote
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
his
subjects
and
although
some
of
his
laws
seem
very
severe
there
is
reason
to
think
that
these
were
never
acted
on
but
about
the
same
time
in
another
part
of
the
empire
which
had
been
usurped
by
one
maximus
an
unhappy
man
named
priscillian
and
some
of
his
companions
were
put
to
death
on
account
of
heresy
such
things
became
sadly
too
common
afterwards
but
at
the
time
the
punishment
of
priscillian
struck
all
good
men
with
horror
martin
bishop
of
tours
who
was
called
the
apostle
of
the
gauls
did
all
that
he
could
to
prevent
it
ambrose
of
whom
you
will
hear
more
in
the
next
chapter
would
not
on
any
account
have
to
do
with
the
bishops
who
had
been
concerned
in
it
and
the
chief
of
these
bishops
was
afterwards
turned
out
of
his
see
and
died
in
banishment
we
may
do
well
to
remember
that
this
first
instance
of
punishing
heresy
with
death
was
under
the
government
of
an
usurper
who
had
made
his
way
to
power
by
rebellion
and
murder
chapter
xv
ambrose
the
greatest
bishop
of
the
west
in
these
times
was
ambrose
of
milan
he
was
born
about
the
year
and
thus
was
ten
or
twelve
years
younger
than
st
basil
and
gregory
of
nazianzum
his
father
had
held
a
very
high
office
under
the
emperors
ambrose
himself
was
brought
up
as
a
lawyer
and
had
risen
to
be
governor
of
liguria
a
large
country
in
the
north
of
italy
of
which
milan
was
the
chief
city
the
bishop
of
milan
who
was
an
arian
died
in
the
year
and
then
a
great
dispute
arose
between
the
orthodox
and
the
arians
as
to
choosing
a
new
bishop
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
might
even
come
to
blows
about
it
when
both
parties
were
assembled
in
the
cathedral
for
the
election
the
governor
ambrose
went
and
made
them
a
speech
desiring
them
to
manage
their
business
peaceably
and
it
is
said
that
as
soon
as
he
had
done
a
little
child
voice
was
heard
crying
out
ambrose
bishop
all
at
once
the
whole
assembly
caught
up
the
words
which
seemed
to
have
something
providential
in
them
and
they
insisted
that
the
governor
should
be
the
new
bishop
now
although
ambrose
had
been
brought
up
as
a
christian
he
was
still
only
a
catechumen
and
had
never
thought
of
being
a
bishop
or
a
clergyman
of
any
kind
and
he
was
afraid
to
undertake
so
high
and
holy
an
office
he
therefore
did
all
that
he
could
to
get
himself
excused
he
tried
to
make
the
people
of
milan
think
that
his
temper
was
too
severe
but
they
saw
through
his
attempts
he
then
escaped
from
the
town
more
than
once
but
he
was
brought
back
valentinian
who
was
then
emperor
approved
the
choice
of
a
bishop
and
ambrose
was
first
baptized
and
a
few
days
afterwards
he
was
consecrated
he
now
studied
very
hard
in
order
to
make
up
for
his
want
of
preparation
for
his
office
he
was
very
active
in
all
sorts
of
pious
and
charitable
works
and
he
soon
became
famous
as
a
preacher
his
steady
firmness
in
maintaining
the
orthodox
faith
was
especially
shown
when
valentinian
widow
justina
who
was
an
arian
wished
to
take
one
of
the
churches
of
milan
from
the
catholics
and
to
give
it
to
her
own
sect
and
after
a
hard
struggle
ambrose
got
the
better
of
her
he
afterwards
gained
a
very
great
influence
both
over
justina
son
valentinian
and
over
his
elder
brother
gratian
and
when
gratian
had
been
murdered
by
the
friends
of
maximus
the
same
maximus
who
put
priscillian
to
death
and
theodosius
came
into
the
west
to
avenge
his
murder
ambrose
had
no
less
power
with
theodosius
than
he
had
had
with
the
younger
emperors
theodosius
took
up
his
abode
for
a
time
at
milan
after
he
had
defeated
and
slain
the
usurper
maximus
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
city
he
went
to
service
at
the
cathedral
and
was
going
to
seat
himself
in
the
part
of
it
nearest
to
the
altar
as
at
constantinople
the
emperor
seat
was
in
that
part
of
the
church
but
ambrose
stopped
him
and
told
him
that
none
but
the
clergy
were
allowed
to
sit
there
and
he
begged
the
emperor
to
take
a
place
at
the
head
of
the
people
outside
the
theodosius
was
so
far
from
being
angry
at
this
that
he
thanked
the
bishop
and
explained
to
him
how
it
was
that
he
had
made
the
mistake
of
going
within
the
rails
and
when
he
got
back
to
constantinople
he
astonished
his
courtiers
by
ordering
that
his
seat
should
be
removed
to
a
place
answering
to
that
in
which
he
had
sat
at
milan
for
that
he
said
was
much
more
seemly
and
proper
there
are
other
stories
about
ambrose
dealings
with
theodosius
but
i
shall
mention
only
one
which
is
the
most
famous
of
all
one
day
when
there
was
to
be
a
great
chariot
race
at
thessalonica
it
happened
that
a
famous
charioteer
who
was
a
favourite
with
the
people
of
the
town
had
been
put
in
prison
by
the
governor
on
account
of
a
very
serious
crime
on
this
a
mob
went
to
the
governor
and
demanded
that
the
man
should
be
set
at
liberty
the
governor
refused
and
thereupon
the
mob
grew
furious
and
murdered
him
with
a
number
of
his
soldiers
and
other
persons
the
emperor
might
have
been
excused
for
showing
heavy
displeasure
at
this
outrage
but
unhappily
the
great
fault
of
his
character
was
a
readiness
to
give
way
to
violent
fits
of
passion
and
on
hearing
what
had
been
done
his
anger
knew
no
bounds
ambrose
who
was
afraid
lest
some
serious
mischief
should
follow
did
all
that
he
could
to
soothe
the
emperor
and
got
a
promise
from
him
that
the
thessalonians
should
be
spared
but
some
other
advisers
afterwards
got
about
theodosius
and
again
inflamed
his
mind
against
the
offenders
so
that
he
gave
orders
for
a
fearful
act
of
cruel
and
treacherous
vengeance
the
people
of
thessalonica
were
invited
in
the
emperor
name
to
some
games
in
the
circus
or
amphitheatre
which
was
a
building
open
to
the
sky
and
large
enough
to
hold
many
thousands
and
when
they
were
all
gathered
together
in
the
place
instead
of
the
amusement
which
had
been
promised
them
they
were
fallen
on
by
soldiers
who
for
three
hours
carried
on
a
savage
butchery
sparing
neither
old
men
women
nor
children
and
making
no
difference
between
innocent
and
guilty
thessalonian
or
stranger
among
those
who
had
come
to
see
the
games
there
was
a
foreign
merchant
who
had
had
no
concern
in
the
outrage
of
the
mob
which
was
punished
in
this
frightful
way
he
had
two
sons
with
him
and
he
offered
his
own
life
with
all
that
he
had
if
the
soldiers
would
but
spare
one
of
them
the
soldiers
were
willing
to
agree
to
this
but
the
poor
father
could
not
make
up
his
mind
which
of
the
sons
he
should
choose
and
the
soldiers
who
were
too
much
enraged
by
their
horrid
work
to
make
any
allowance
for
his
feelings
stabbed
both
the
youths
before
his
eyes
at
the
same
moment
the
number
of
persons
slain
in
the
massacre
is
not
certain
there
were
at
least
as
many
as
seven
thousand
and
some
writers
say
that
there
were
fifteen
thousand
when
ambrose
heard
of
this
shocking
affair
he
was
filled
with
grief
and
horror
for
he
had
relied
on
the
emperor
promise
to
spare
the
thessalonians
and
great
care
had
been
taken
that
he
should
not
know
anything
of
the
orders
which
had
been
afterwards
sent
off
he
wrote
a
letter
to
theodosius
exhorting
him
to
repent
and
telling
him
that
unless
he
did
so
he
could
not
be
admitted
to
the
holy
communion
this
letter
brought
the
emperor
to
feel
that
he
had
done
very
wrongly
but
ambrose
wished
to
make
him
feel
it
far
more
as
theodosius
was
about
to
enter
the
cathedral
the
bishop
met
him
in
the
porch
and
laying
hold
on
his
robe
desired
him
to
withdraw
because
he
was
a
man
stained
with
innocent
blood
the
emperor
said
that
he
was
deeply
grieved
for
his
offence
but
ambrose
told
him
that
this
was
not
enough
that
he
must
show
some
more
public
proofs
of
his
repentance
for
so
great
a
sin
the
emperor
withdrew
accordingly
to
his
palace
where
he
shut
himself
up
for
eight
months
refusing
to
wear
his
imperial
robes
and
spending
his
time
in
sadness
and
penitence
at
length
when
christmas
was
drawing
near
he
went
to
the
bishop
and
humbly
begged
that
he
might
be
admitted
into
the
church
again
ambrose
desired
him
to
give
some
substantial
token
of
his
sorrow
and
the
emperor
agreed
to
make
a
law
by
which
no
sentence
of
death
should
be
executed
until
thirty
days
after
it
had
been
passed
this
law
was
meant
to
prevent
any
more
such
sad
effects
of
sudden
passion
in
princes
as
the
massacre
of
thessalonica
the
emperor
was
then
allowed
to
enter
the
church
where
he
fell
down
on
the
pavement
with
every
appearance
of
the
deepest
grief
and
humiliation
and
it
is
said
that
from
that
time
he
never
spent
a
day
without
remembering
the
crime
into
which
his
passion
had
betrayed
him
theodosius
was
the
last
emperor
who
kept
up
the
ancient
glory
of
rome
he
is
called
the
great
and
in
many
respects
was
well
deserving
of
the
name
he
died
in
and
ambrose
died
within
two
years
after
on
easter
eve
in
the
year
chapter
xvi
the
temple
of
serapis
in
the
account
of
constantine
it
was
mentioned
that
the
emperors
after
their
conversion
did
not
try
to
put
down
heathenism
by
force
or
all
at
once
for
the
wise
teachers
of
the
church
knew
that
this
would
not
be
the
right
way
of
going
to
work
but
that
it
would
be
more
likely
to
make
the
heathens
obstinate
than
to
convert
them
thus
augustine
of
whom
i
shall
have
more
to
tell
you
says
in
one
of
his
sermons
we
must
first
endeavour
to
break
the
idols
in
their
hearts
when
they
themselves
become
christians
they
will
either
invite
us
to
the
good
work
of
destroying
their
idols
or
they
will
be
beforehand
with
us
in
doing
so
and
in
the
mean
while
we
must
pray
for
them
not
be
angry
with
them
page
but
in
course
of
time
as
the
people
were
more
and
more
brought
off
from
heathenism
and
as
the
belief
of
the
gospel
worked
its
way
more
thoroughly
among
all
classes
of
them
laws
were
sent
forth
against
offering
sacrifices
burning
incense
and
the
like
to
the
heathen
gods
these
laws
were
by
degrees
made
stricter
and
stricter
until
in
the
reign
of
theodosius
it
was
forbidden
to
do
any
act
of
heathen
worship
and
i
may
now
tell
you
what
took
place
as
to
the
idols
of
egypt
in
this
reign
it
was
in
the
year
that
an
old
heathen
temple
at
alexandria
was
given
up
to
the
bishop
of
the
city
who
wished
to
build
a
church
on
the
spot
in
digging
out
the
foundation
for
the
church
some
strange
and
disgusting
things
which
had
been
used
in
the
heathen
worship
were
found
and
some
of
the
christians
carried
these
about
the
streets
by
way
of
mocking
at
the
religion
of
the
heathens
the
heathen
part
of
the
inhabitants
were
enraged
a
number
of
them
made
an
uproar
killed
some
christians
and
then
shut
themselves
up
in
the
temple
of
one
of
their
gods
called
serapis
whom
they
believed
to
be
the
protector
of
alexandria
this
temple
was
surrounded
by
the
houses
of
the
priests
and
other
buildings
and
the
whole
was
so
vast
and
so
magnificent
that
it
was
counted
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
the
rioters
who
had
shut
themselves
up
in
the
temple
used
to
rush
out
from
it
now
and
then
killing
some
of
the
christians
who
fell
in
their
way
and
carrying
off
others
as
prisoners
these
prisoners
were
desired
to
offer
sacrifice
if
they
refused
they
were
cruelly
tortured
and
some
of
them
were
even
crucified
a
report
of
these
doings
was
sent
to
theodosius
and
he
ordered
that
all
the
temples
of
alexandria
should
be
destroyed
the
governor
invited
the
defenders
of
the
temple
of
serapis
to
attend
in
the
where
the
emperor
sentence
was
to
be
read
and
on
hearing
what
it
was
they
fled
in
all
directions
so
that
the
soldiers
who
were
sent
to
the
temple
found
nobody
there
to
withstand
them
the
idol
of
serapis
was
of
such
vast
size
that
it
reached
from
one
side
of
the
temple
to
the
other
it
was
adorned
with
jewels
and
was
covered
with
plates
of
gold
and
silver
and
its
worshippers
believed
that
if
it
were
hurt
in
any
way
heaven
and
earth
would
go
to
wreck
so
when
a
soldier
mounted
a
ladder
and
raised
his
axe
against
it
the
heathens
who
stood
by
were
in
great
terror
and
even
some
of
the
christians
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
uneasiness
as
to
what
might
follow
but
the
stout
soldier
first
made
a
blow
which
struck
off
one
of
the
cheeks
and
then
dashed
his
axe
into
one
of
his
knees
serapis
however
bore
all
this
quietly
and
the
bystanders
began
to
draw
their
breath
more
freely
the
soldier
worked
away
manfully
and
after
a
while
the
huge
head
of
the
idol
came
crashing
down
when
a
swarm
of
rats
which
had
long
made
their
home
in
it
rushed
forth
and
scampered
off
in
all
directions
even
the
heathens
who
were
in
the
crowd
on
seeing
this
began
to
laugh
at
their
god
the
idol
was
demolished
and
the
pieces
of
it
were
carried
into
the
circus
where
a
bonfire
was
made
of
them
and
in
examining
the
temple
a
number
of
tricks
by
which
the
priests
had
deceived
the
people
were
found
out
so
that
many
heathens
were
converted
in
consequence
of
having
thus
seen
the
vanity
of
their
old
religion
and
the
falsehood
of
the
means
by
which
it
was
kept
up
egypt
as
you
perhaps
know
does
not
depend
on
rain
for
its
crops
but
on
the
rising
of
the
river
nile
which
floods
the
country
at
a
certain
season
and
the
heathens
had
long
said
that
the
christians
were
afraid
to
destroy
the
idols
of
egypt
lest
the
gods
should
punish
them
by
not
allowing
the
water
to
rise
after
the
destruction
of
serapis
the
usual
time
for
the
rising
of
the
river
came
but
there
were
no
signs
of
it
and
the
heathens
began
to
be
in
great
delight
and
to
boast
that
their
gods
were
going
to
take
vengeance
some
weak
christians
too
began
to
think
that
there
might
be
some
truth
in
this
and
sent
to
ask
the
emperor
what
should
be
done
better
he
said
that
the
nile
should
not
rise
at
all
than
that
we
should
buy
the
fruitfulness
of
egypt
by
idolatry
after
a
while
the
nile
began
to
swell
it
soon
mounted
above
the
usual
height
of
its
flood
and
the
pagans
were
now
in
hopes
that
serapis
was
about
to
avenge
himself
by
such
a
deluge
as
would
punish
the
christians
for
the
destruction
of
the
idol
but
they
were
again
disappointed
by
seeing
the
waters
sink
down
to
their
proper
level
the
emperor
orders
were
executed
by
the
destruction
of
the
egyptian
temples
and
their
idols
but
we
are
told
that
the
bishop
of
alexandria
saved
one
image
as
a
curiosity
and
lest
people
should
afterwards
deny
that
their
forefathers
had
ever
been
so
foolish
as
to
worship
such
things
some
say
that
this
image
was
a
figure
of
jupiter
the
chief
of
the
heathen
gods
others
say
that
it
was
the
figure
of
a
monkey
for
even
monkeys
were
worshipped
by
the
egyptians
chapter
xvii
church
government
by
this
time
the
gospel
had
not
only
been
firmly
settled
as
the
religion
of
the
great
roman
empire
but
had
made
its
way
into
most
other
countries
of
the
world
then
known
here
then
we
may
stop
to
take
a
view
of
some
things
connected
with
the
church
and
it
will
be
well
in
doing
so
to
remember
what
is
wisely
said
by
our
own
church
in
her
article
which
is
about
the
traditions
of
the
church
that
is
to
say
the
practices
in
the
church
it
is
not
necessary
that
traditions
and
ceremonies
be
in
all
places
one
and
utterly
like
for
at
all
times
they
have
been
divers
that
is
they
have
differed
in
different
parts
of
christ
church
and
they
may
be
changed
according
to
the
diversities
of
countries
times
and
manners
so
that
nothing
be
ordained
against
god
word
first
then
as
to
the
ministers
of
the
church
the
three
orders
which
had
been
from
the
beginning
bishops
presbyters
or
priests
and
deacons
were
considered
to
stand
by
themselves
as
the
only
orders
to
a
church
but
early
in
the
third
century
a
number
of
other
orders
were
introduced
all
lower
than
that
of
deacons
these
were
the
who
helped
the
deacons
in
the
care
of
the
poor
and
of
the
property
belonging
to
the
church
the
who
lighted
the
lamps
and
assisted
in
the
celebration
of
the
sacraments
the
who
took
charge
of
persons
suffering
from
afflictions
resembling
the
possession
by
devils
which
is
spoken
of
in
the
new
testament
the
whose
business
it
was
to
read
the
scriptures
in
church
and
the
all
these
were
considered
to
belong
to
the
clergy
just
as
if
among
ourselves
the
organist
the
clerk
the
sexton
the
singers
and
the
of
a
church
were
to
be
reckoned
as
clergy
and
were
to
be
appointed
to
their
offices
by
a
religious
ceremony
or
ordination
but
these
new
orders
were
not
used
everywhere
and
as
has
been
said
the
persons
who
were
in
these
orders
were
not
considered
to
be
clergy
in
the
same
way
as
those
of
the
three
higher
orders
which
had
been
ever
since
the
days
of
the
apostles
page
there
were
also
in
the
earliest
times
women
called
such
as
phoebe
who
is
mentioned
in
the
epistle
to
the
romans
xvi
i
these
deaconesses
who
were
often
pious
widows
were
employed
among
christians
of
their
own
sex
for
such
works
of
mercy
and
instruction
as
were
not
fit
for
men
to
do
or
at
least
were
supposed
not
to
be
so
according
to
the
manners
of
the
greeks
and
of
the
other
ancient
nations
but
the
order
of
deaconesses
does
not
seem
to
have
lasted
long
all
bishops
as
i
have
said
already
are
of
one
order
but
in
course
of
time
it
was
found
convenient
for
the
government
of
the
church
that
some
of
them
should
be
placed
higher
than
others
and
the
way
in
which
this
was
settled
was
very
natural
the
bishops
of
a
country
found
it
desirable
to
meet
sometimes
that
they
might
consult
with
each
other
as
we
are
told
that
the
apostles
did
at
jerusalem
xv
and
in
most
countries
these
meetings
which
were
called
or
came
to
be
regularly
held
once
or
twice
a
year
the
chief
city
of
each
district
was
naturally
the
place
of
meeting
and
the
bishop
of
this
city
was
naturally
the
chairman
or
president
of
the
assembly
just
as
we
read
that
in
the
council
of
the
apostles
james
who
was
bishop
of
jerusalem
where
it
was
held
spoke
with
the
greatest
authority
after
all
the
rest
and
that
his
sentence
was
given
as
the
judgment
of
the
assembly
these
bishops
then
got
the
title
of
because
each
was
bishop
of
the
or
of
the
country
in
which
the
council
was
held
and
thus
they
came
to
be
considered
higher
than
their
brethren
and
of
course
when
any
messages
or
letters
were
to
be
sent
to
the
churches
of
other
countries
the
metropolitan
was
the
person
in
whose
name
it
was
done
page
and
as
all
this
was
the
natural
course
of
things
in
every
country
it
was
also
natural
that
the
bishops
of
very
great
cities
should
be
considered
as
still
higher
than
the
ordinary
metropolitans
thus
the
bishoprics
of
rome
of
alexandria
and
of
antioch
which
were
the
three
greatest
cities
of
the
empire
were
regarded
as
the
chief
bishoprics
and
as
superior
to
all
others
those
of
rome
and
antioch
were
both
supposed
to
have
been
founded
by
peter
and
alexandria
was
believed
to
have
been
founded
by
mark
under
the
direction
of
peter
hence
it
afterwards
came
to
be
thought
that
this
was
the
cause
of
their
greatness
and
the
bishops
of
rome
especially
liked
to
have
this
believed
because
they
could
then
pretend
to
claim
some
sort
of
especial
power
which
they
said
that
our
lord
had
given
to
peter
above
the
other
apostles
and
that
peter
had
left
it
to
his
successors
but
such
claims
were
quite
unfounded
and
it
is
clear
that
the
real
reason
why
these
three
churches
stood
higher
than
others
was
that
they
were
in
the
three
greatest
cities
of
the
whole
empire
but
the
church
of
rome
had
many
advantages
over
alexandria
and
antioch
as
well
as
over
every
other
it
was
the
greatest
and
the
richest
of
all
so
that
it
could
send
help
to
distressed
christians
in
all
countries
no
other
church
of
the
west
had
an
apostle
to
boast
of
but
rome
could
boast
of
the
two
great
apostles
peter
and
paul
who
had
laboured
in
it
and
had
given
their
blood
for
the
faith
in
the
gospel
in
it
most
of
the
western
nations
had
received
their
knowledge
of
the
gospel
through
the
roman
church
and
on
this
account
they
looked
up
with
respect
to
it
as
a
mother
and
as
people
from
all
parts
of
the
empire
were
continually
going
to
rome
and
returning
the
church
of
the
great
capital
kept
up
a
constant
intercourse
with
other
churches
in
all
quarters
thus
the
bishops
of
rome
were
naturally
much
respected
everywhere
and
so
long
as
they
did
not
take
too
much
upon
themselves
great
regard
was
paid
to
their
opinion
but
when
they
tried
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
other
bishops
or
to
lord
it
over
other
churches
they
were
firmly
withstood
and
were
desired
to
keep
within
their
proper
bounds
as
stephen
of
rome
was
by
cyprian
of
carthage
page
another
thing
must
be
mentioned
as
creditable
to
the
roman
church
and
as
one
which
did
much
to
raise
the
power
of
its
bishops
the
heresies
which
we
have
read
of
all
began
in
the
east
where
the
people
were
more
and
restless
in
their
thoughts
than
those
of
the
west
the
romans
on
the
other
hand
had
not
the
turn
of
mind
which
led
to
these
errors
but
rather
attended
to
practical
things
hence
they
were
disposed
to
hold
to
the
faith
which
had
come
down
to
them
from
their
fathers
and
to
defend
it
against
the
new
opinions
which
were
brought
forward
from
time
to
time
this
steadiness
then
gave
them
a
great
advantage
over
the
christians
of
the
east
who
were
frequently
changing
from
one
thing
to
another
it
gained
for
the
roman
church
much
credit
and
authority
and
when
the
great
arian
controversy
arose
the
effects
of
the
difference
between
the
eastern
and
the
western
character
were
vastly
increased
the
romans
except
for
a
short
time
when
a
bishop
named
liberius
was
won
over
by
the
arians
kept
to
their
old
faith
the
eastern
parties
looked
to
the
bishop
of
rome
as
if
he
had
the
whole
western
church
in
his
hands
they
constantly
carried
their
quarrels
to
him
asking
him
to
give
his
help
and
he
was
the
strongest
friend
that
they
could
find
anywhere
and
when
the
side
which
rome
had
always
upheld
got
the
victory
at
last
the
importance
of
the
roman
bishops
rose
in
consequence
but
even
after
all
this
if
the
bishop
of
rome
tried
to
meddle
with
other
churches
his
right
to
do
so
was
still
denied
many
canons
that
is
to
say
of
the
were
made
to
forbid
the
carrying
of
any
quarrel
for
judgment
beyond
the
country
in
which
it
began
and
however
glad
the
churches
of
africa
and
of
the
east
were
to
have
the
bishop
of
rome
for
a
friend
they
would
never
allow
him
to
assume
the
airs
of
a
master
and
from
the
time
when
constantinople
was
built
in
the
place
of
byzantium
a
new
great
church
arose
byzantium
had
been
only
a
common
bishopric
and
for
a
time
constantinople
was
not
called
anything
more
than
a
common
bishopric
but
in
real
importance
it
was
very
much
more
so
that
even
a
bishop
of
antioch
the
third
see
in
the
whole
christian
world
thought
himself
advanced
when
he
was
made
bishop
of
constantinople
instead
but
the
second
general
council
which
as
we
have
seen
was
held
at
constantinople
in
the
year
made
a
canon
by
which
constantinople
was
placed
next
to
rome
because
as
the
canon
said
it
is
a
new
rome
this
raised
the
jealousy
not
only
of
antioch
and
still
more
of
alexandria
at
having
an
upstart
bishopric
as
they
considered
it
put
over
their
heads
but
it
gave
great
offence
to
the
bishops
of
rome
who
could
not
bear
such
a
rivalry
as
was
now
threatened
and
were
besides
very
angry
on
account
of
the
reason
which
was
given
for
placing
constantinople
next
after
rome
for
the
council
when
it
said
that
constantinople
was
to
be
second
among
all
churches
because
of
its
being
a
new
rome
meant
to
say
that
the
reason
why
rome
itself
stood
first
was
nothing
more
than
its
being
the
old
capital
of
the
empire
whereas
the
bishops
of
rome
wished
it
to
be
thought
that
their
power
was
founded
on
their
being
the
successors
of
peter
page
we
shall
see
something
of
the
effects
of
these
jealousies
chapter
xviii
christian
worship
part
i
in
the
early
days
of
the
gospel
while
the
christians
were
generally
poor
and
when
they
were
obliged
to
meet
in
fear
of
the
heathen
their
worship
was
held
in
private
houses
and
sometimes
in
but
after
a
time
buildings
were
expressly
set
apart
for
worship
it
has
been
mentioned
that
in
the
years
of
quiet
between
the
death
of
valerian
and
the
last
persecution
these
churches
were
built
much
more
handsomely
than
before
and
were
furnished
with
gold
and
silver
plate
and
other
rich
ornaments
and
after
the
conversion
of
constantine
they
became
still
finer
and
costlier
the
clergy
then
wore
rich
dresses
at
service
the
music
was
less
simple
and
the
ceremonies
were
multiplied
some
of
the
old
heathen
temples
were
turned
into
churches
but
temples
were
not
built
in
a
shape
very
suitable
for
christian
worship
and
the
pattern
of
the
new
churches
was
rather
taken
from
the
halls
of
justice
called
which
were
to
be
found
in
every
large
town
these
buildings
were
of
an
oblong
shape
with
a
broad
middle
part
and
on
each
side
of
it
an
aisle
separated
from
it
by
a
row
of
pillars
this
lower
part
of
the
basilica
was
used
by
merchants
who
met
to
talk
about
their
business
and
by
all
sorts
of
loungers
who
met
to
tell
and
hear
the
news
but
at
the
upper
end
of
the
oblong
there
was
a
half
circle
with
its
floor
raised
above
the
level
of
the
rest
and
in
the
middle
of
this
part
the
judge
of
the
city
sat
now
if
you
will
compare
this
description
with
the
plan
of
a
church
you
will
see
that
the
broad
middle
part
of
the
basilica
answers
to
what
is
called
the
or
of
the
church
that
the
side
are
alike
in
each
and
that
the
further
part
of
the
basilica
with
its
raised
floor
answers
to
the
of
a
church
while
the
or
stands
in
the
place
answering
to
the
seat
in
the
basilica
some
of
these
halls
were
given
up
by
the
emperors
to
be
turned
into
churches
and
the
plan
of
them
was
found
convenient
as
a
pattern
in
the
building
of
new
churches
page
on
entering
a
church
the
first
part
was
the
in
which
there
were
places
for
the
catechumens
that
is
to
say
those
who
were
preparing
for
baptism
for
those
who
were
supposed
to
be
possessed
with
devils

were

for
the
lowest
kinds
of
those
who
were
undergoing
penance
beyond
this
porch
were
the
which
opened
into
the
of
the
church
just
within
these
gates
were
those
penitents
whose
time
of
penance
was
nearly
ended
and
the
rest
of
the
nave
was
the
place
for
the
that
is
to
say
for
those
who
were
admitted
to
all
the
privileges
of
christians
at
the
upper
end
of
the
nave
a
place
called
the
was
railed
in
for
the
singers
and
then
last
of
all
came
the
raised
part
or
chancel
which
has
been
spoken
of
this
was
called
the
and
was
set
apart
for
the
clergy
only
the
women
sat
in
church
apart
from
the
men
sometimes
they
were
in
the
aisles
and
sometimes
in
galleries
churches
generally
had
a
court
in
front
of
them
or
about
them
in
which
were
the
lodgings
of
the
clergy
and
a
building
for
the
administration
of
baptism
called
the
page
in
the
early
times
churches
were
not
adorned
with
pictures
or
statues
for
christians
were
at
first
afraid
to
have
any
ornaments
of
the
kind
lest
they
should
fall
into
idolatry
like
the
heathen
no
such
things
as
images
or
pictures
of
our
lord
or
of
his
saints
were
known
among
them
and
in
their
life
instead
of
the
figures
of
gods
with
which
the
heathens
used
to
adorn
their
houses
their
furniture
their
cups
and
their
seals
the
christians
made
use
of
emblems
only
thus
instead
of
pretending
to
make
a
likeness
of
our
lord
human
form
they
made
a
figure
of
a
shepherd
carrying
a
lamb
on
his
shoulders
to
signify
the
good
shepherd
who
gave
his
life
for
his
sheep
x
other
ornaments
of
the
same
kind
were
a
signifying
the
holy
ghost
a
signifying
the
church
the
ark
of
salvation
sailing
towards
heaven
a
which
was
meant
to
remind
them
of
their
having
been
born
again
in
the
water
at
their
baptism
a
musical
instrument
called
a
to
signify
christian
joy
and
an
the
figure
of
christian
hope
about
the
year
the
council
of
elvira
in
spain
made
a
canon
forbidding
pictures
in
church
which
shows
that
the
practice
had
then
begun
and
was
growing
and
also
that
in
spain
at
least
it
was
thought
to
be
dangerous
as
indeed
it
too
surely
proved
to
be
and
a
hundred
years
later
epiphanius
a
famous
bishop
of
salamis
in
the
island
of
cyprus
tore
a
curtain
which
he
found
hanging
in
a
church
with
a
figure
of
our
lord
or
of
some
saint
painted
on
it
he
declared
that
such
things
were
altogether
unlawful
and
desired
that
the
curtain
might
be
used
to
bury
some
poor
man
in
promising
to
send
the
church
a
plain
one
instead
of
it
christians
used
to
sign
themselves
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
many
occasions
and
figures
of
the
cross
were
early
set
up
in
churches
but
crucifixes
which
are
figures
of
our
lord
on
the
cross
although
ignorant
people
sometimes
call
the
cross
itself
a
crucifix
were
not
known
until
hundreds
of
years
after
the
time
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
part
ii
the
of
christians
was
always
the
same
as
to
its
main
parts
although
there
were
little
differences
as
to
order
and
the
like
justin
martyr
who
lived
as
we
have
seen
about
the
middle
of
the
second
century
describes
the
service
as
it
was
in
his
time
it
began
he
says
with
readings
from
the
scriptures
then
followed
a
discourse
by
the
chief
clergyman
who
was
present
and
there
was
much
singing
of
which
a
part
was
from
the
old
testament
psalms
while
a
part
was
made
up
of
hymns
on
christian
subjects
the
discourses
of
the
clergy
were
generally
meant
to
explain
the
scripture
lessons
which
had
been
read
at
first
these
discourses
were
very
plain
and
as
much
as
possible
like
ordinary
talk
and
from
this
they
got
the
name
of
which
properly
meant
nothing
more
than
but
by
degrees
they
grew
to
be
more
like
speeches
and
people
used
to
flock
to
them
just
as
many
do
now
from
a
wish
to
hear
something
fine
rather
than
with
any
notion
of
taking
the
preacher
words
to
heart
and
trying
to
be
made
better
by
them
and
in
the
fourth
century
when
a
clergyman
preached
eloquently
the
people
used
to
cheer
him
on
by
clapping
their
hands
waving
their
handkerchiefs
and
shouting
out
orthodox
thirteenth
apostle
or
other
such
cries
good
men
of
course
did
not
like
to
be
treated
in
this
way
as
if
they
were
actors
at
a
theatre
and
we
often
find
chrysostom
and
augustine
of
both
of
whom
you
will
hear
objecting
to
it
in
their
sermons
and
begging
their
hearers
not
to
show
their
admiration
in
such
foolish
and
unseemly
ways
but
it
seems
that
the
people
went
on
with
it
nevertheless
and
no
doubt
there
must
have
been
some
preachers
who
were
vain
enough
and
silly
enough
to
be
pleased
with
it
see
chapter
iii
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
was
celebrated
in
the
evening
as
it
had
been
by
our
blessed
lord
himself
on
the
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
thus
it
was
for
instance
when
the
disciples
at
troas
came
together
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
sunday
to
break
bread
that
is
to
celebrate
the
lord
supper
and
paul
preached
unto
them
and
continued
his
speech
until
midnight
xx
in
the
service
for
this
sacrament
there
was
a
thanksgiving
to
god
for
his
bounty
in
bestowing
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
congregation
offered
gifts
of
bread
and
wine
and
from
these
the
elements
which
were
to
be
consecrated
were
taken
they
also
brought
gifts
of
money
which
was
used
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
for
the
support
of
the
clergy
and
for
other
good
and
religious
purposes
either
before
or
after
the
sacrament
there
was
a
meal
called
the
for
which
all
the
members
of
the
congregation
brought
provisions
according
as
they
could
afford
all
of
them
sat
down
to
it
as
equals
in
token
of
their
being
alike
in
christ
brotherhood
and
it
ended
with
and
prayer
but
even
in
very
early
days
as
paul
shows
us
in
his
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
xi
there
was
sad
misbehaviour
at
these
meals
and
besides
this
such
religious
feasts
gave
the
heathen
an
excuse
for
their
stories
that
the
christians
met
to
feed
on
human
flesh
and
to
commit
other
abominations
in
secret
for
these
reasons
after
a
time
the
was
separated
from
the
holy
communion
and
at
length
it
was
entirely
given
up
see
page
in
the
second
century
the
administration
of
the
lord
supper
instead
of
being
in
the
evening
as
at
first
was
added
on
to
the
morning
service
and
then
a
difference
was
made
between
the
two
parts
of
the
service
at
the
earlier
part
of
it
the
catechumens
and
penitents
might
be
present
but
when
the
communion
office
was
going
to
begin
a
deacon
called
out
let
no
one
of
the
catechumens
or
of
the
hearers
stay
after
this
none
were
allowed
to
remain
except
those
who
were
entitled
to
communicate
which
all
baptized
christians
did
in
those
days
unless
they
were
shut
out
from
the
church
on
account
of
their
misdeeds
the
breaking
of
bread
in
the
lord
supper
was
at
first
daily
as
we
know
from
the
early
chapters
of
the
acts
ii
but
this
practice
does
not
seem
to
have
lasted
beyond
the
time
when
the
faith
of
the
christians
was
in
its
first
warmth
and
it
became
usual
to
celebrate
the
holy
communion
on
the
lord
day
only
when
christianity
became
the
religion
of
the
empire
and
there
was
now
no
fear
of
persecution
the
earlier
part
of
the
service
was
open
not
only
to
catechumens
and
penitents
but
to
jews
and
heathens
and
in
the
fifth
century
when
the
church
was
mostly
made
up
of
persons
who
had
been
baptized
and
trained
in
christianity
from
their
infancy
the
distinction
between
the
service
of
the
catechumens
and
the
service
of
the
faithful
was
no
longer
kept
up
the
length
of
time
during
which
converts
were
obliged
to
be
catechumens
before
being
admitted
to
baptism
differed
in
different
parts
of
the
church
in
some
places
it
was
two
years
in
some
three
years
but
if
during
this
time
they
fell
sick
and
appeared
to
be
in
danger
of
death
they
were
baptized
without
waiting
any
longer
at
baptism
those
who
received
it
professed
their
faith
or
their
sponsors
did
so
for
them
and
from
this
began
the
use
of
containing
in
few
words
the
chief
articles
of
the
christian
faith
the
sign
of
the
cross
was
made
over
those
who
were
baptized
in
token
that
they
should
not
be
ashamed
to
confess
the
faith
of
christ
crucified
and
manfully
to
fight
under
his
banner
against
sin
the
world
and
the
devil
and
to
continue
christ
faithful
soldiers
and
servants
unto
their
life
end
the
kiss
of
peace
was
given
to
them
in
token
of
their
being
taken
into
spiritual
brotherhood
white
robes
were
put
on
them
to
signify
their
cleansing
from
sin
and
a
mixture
of
milk
and
honey
was
administered
to
them
as
if
to
give
them
a
foretaste
of
their
heavenly
inheritance
of
which
the
earthly
canaan
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
iii
had
been
a
figure
other
ceremonies
were
added
in
the
fourth
century
such
as
the
use
of
salt
and
lights
and
an
anointing
with
oil
in
token
of
their
being
made
kings
and
priests
to
god
i
ii
besides
the
anointing
with
a
mixture
called
at
confirmation
which
had
been
practised
in
earlier
times
the
usual
time
of
baptism
was
the
season
from
to
whitsuntide
but
in
case
of
danger
persons
might
be
baptized
at
any
time
part
iii
during
the
fourth
century
there
was
a
growth
of
superstitions
and
corruptions
in
the
church
great
numbers
of
converts
came
into
it
bringing
their
old
heathen
notions
with
them
and
not
well
knowing
what
they
might
expect
but
with
an
eager
desire
to
find
as
much
to
interest
them
in
the
worship
and
life
of
christians
as
they
had
found
in
the
ceremonies
and
shows
of
their
former
religion
and
in
order
that
such
converts
might
not
be
altogether
disappointed
the
christian
teachers
of
the
age
allowed
a
number
of
things
which
soon
began
to
have
very
bad
effects
thus
as
we
are
told
in
the
preface
to
our
own
augustine
complained
that
in
his
time
which
was
about
the
year
ceremonies
were
grown
to
such
a
number
that
the
estate
of
christian
people
was
in
worse
case
concerning
that
matter
than
were
the
jews
among
the
corruptions
which
were
now
growing
although
they
did
not
come
to
a
head
until
afterwards
one
was
an
excess
of
reverence
for
saints
which
led
to
the
practices
of
making
addresses
to
them
and
of
paying
superstitious
honours
to
their
dead
bodies
another
corruption
was
the
improper
use
of
paintings
or
images
which
even
in
augustine
time
had
gone
so
far
that
as
he
owns
with
sorrow
many
of
the
ignorant
were
worshippers
of
pictures
another
was
the
fashion
of
going
on
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
in
which
constantine
mother
helena
set
an
example
which
was
soon
followed
by
thousands
who
not
only
fancied
that
the
sight
of
the
places
hallowed
by
the
great
events
of
scripture
would
kindle
or
heighten
their
devotion
but
that
prayers
would
be
especially
pleasing
to
god
if
they
were
offered
up
in
such
places
and
thus
great
numbers
flocked
to
palestine
from
all
quarters
and
even
from
britain
among
other
countries
and
on
their
return
they
carried
back
with
them
water
from
the
jordan
earth
from
the
redeemer
sepulchre
or
what
they
believed
to
be
chips
of
the
true
cross
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
found
during
helena
visit
to
jerusalem
the
mischiefs
of
this
fashion
soon
showed
themselves
st
basil
brother
gregory
of
nyssa
wrote
a
little
book
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
persuading
people
not
to
go
on
pilgrimage
he
said
that
he
himself
had
been
neither
better
nor
worse
for
a
visit
which
he
had
paid
to
the
holy
land
but
that
such
a
pilgrimage
might
even
be
dangerous
for
others
because
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
were
so
vicious
that
there
was
more
likelihood
of
getting
harm
from
them
than
good
from
the
sight
of
the
holy
places
we
should
rather
try
he
said
to
go
out
of
the
body
than
to
drag
it
about
from
place
to
place
another
very
learned
man
of
the
same
time
jerome
although
he
had
taken
up
his
own
abode
at
bethlehem
saw
so
much
of
the
evils
which
arose
from
pilgrimages
that
he
gave
very
earnest
warnings
against
them
it
is
no
praise
he
says
to
have
been
at
jerusalem
but
to
have
lived
religiously
at
jerusalem
the
sight
of
the
places
where
our
lord
died
and
rose
again
are
profitable
to
those
who
bear
their
own
cross
and
daily
rise
again
with
him
but
for
those
who
say
temple
of
the
lord
the
temple
of
the
vii
let
them
hear
the
apostle
words
are
the
temple
of
god
and
the
spirit
of
god
dwelleth
in
you
iii
the
court
of
heaven
is
open
to
approach
from
jerusalem
and
from
britain
alike
the
kingdom
of
god
is
you
xvii
there
were
indeed
some
persons
who
rose
up
to
oppose
the
errors
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
but
unhappily
they
mixed
up
the
truths
which
they
wished
to
teach
with
so
many
errors
of
their
own
and
they
carried
on
their
opposition
so
unwisely
that
instead
of
doing
good
they
did
harm
by
setting
people
against
such
truth
as
they
taught
on
account
of
the
error
which
was
joined
with
it
and
of
the
wrong
way
which
they
took
of
teaching
it
by
such
opposition
the
growth
of
superstition
was
not
checked
but
advanced
and
strengthened
chapter
xix
arcadius
and
honorius
the
great
emperor
theodosius
was
succeeded
in
by
his
two
sons
arcadius
who
was
eighteen
years
of
age
and
honorius
who
was
only
eleven
arcadius
had
the
east
and
honorius
the
west
and
after
this
division
the
empire
was
never
again
united
in
anything
like
the
full
extent
of
its
old
greatness
the
reigns
of
these
princes
were
full
of
misfortunes
especially
in
the
western
empire
where
swarms
of
barbarians
poured
down
from
the
north
and
did
a
vast
deal
of
mischief
one
of
these
barbarous
nations
the
goths
whose
king
was
named
alaric
thrice
besieged
rome
itself
the
first
time
alaric
was
bought
off
by
a
large
sum
of
money
after
the
second
siege
he
set
up
an
emperor
of
his
own
making
and
after
the
third
siege
the
city
was
given
up
to
his
soldiers
for
plunder
rude
as
these
goths
were
they
had
been
brought
over
to
a
kind
of
christianity
although
it
was
not
the
true
faith
of
the
church
there
had
indeed
been
christians
among
the
goths
nearly
years
before
this
time
for
many
of
them
had
been
converted
by
christian
captives
whom
they
carried
off
in
the
reigns
of
valerian
and
gallienus
about
the
year
and
a
gothic
bishop
named
theophilus
had
sat
at
the
council
of
nicæa
but
great
changes
had
since
been
wrought
among
them
by
a
remarkable
man
named
ulfilas
who
was
consecrated
as
their
bishop
in
the
year
he
found
that
they
did
not
know
the
use
of
letters
so
he
made
an
alphabet
for
them
and
translated
the
scriptures
into
their
language
and
he
taught
them
many
useful
arts
thus
he
got
such
an
influence
over
them
that
they
received
all
his
words
as
law
and
he
was
called
the
moses
of
the
goths
but
unhappily
ulfilas
was
drawn
into
arianism
and
this
was
the
doctrine
which
he
taught
to
his
people
instead
of
the
sound
faith
which
had
before
been
preached
to
them
by
theophilus
and
others
but
still
although
their
christianity
was
not
of
the
right
kind
it
had
good
effects
on
these
rough
people
and
so
it
appeared
when
rome
was
given
over
by
the
conqueror
alaric
to
his
soldiers
although
they
destroyed
temples
they
paid
great
respect
to
churches
and
they
did
not
commit
such
terrible
acts
of
cruelty
and
violence
as
had
been
usual
when
cities
were
taken
by
heathen
armies
i
need
not
say
more
about
these
sad
times
but
i
must
not
forget
to
tell
what
was
done
by
a
monk
named
telemachus
in
the
reign
of
honorius
in
the
year
one
of
the
emperor
generals
defeated
alaric
in
the
north
of
italy
and
the
romans
who
in
those
days
were
not
much
used
to
victories
made
the
most
of
this
one
and
held
great
games
in
honour
of
it
now
the
public
games
of
the
romans
were
generally
of
a
cruel
kind
we
have
seen
how
in
former
days
they
used
to
let
wild
beasts
loose
against
the
christian
martyrs
in
their
amphitheatres
and
another
of
their
favourite
pastimes
was
to
set
men
who
were
called
gladiators
that
is
to
fight
and
kill
each
other
in
those
same
places
the
love
of
these
shows
of
gladiators
was
so
strong
in
the
people
of
rome
that
constantine
had
not
ventured
to
do
away
with
them
there
although
he
would
not
allow
any
such
things
in
the
new
christian
capital
which
he
built
and
the
custom
of
setting
men
to
slaughter
one
another
for
the
amusement
of
the
had
lasted
at
rome
down
to
the
time
of
honorius
page
telemachus
then
who
was
an
eastern
monk
was
greatly
shocked
that
christians
should
take
pleasure
in
these
savage
sports
and
when
he
heard
of
the
great
games
which
were
preparing
he
resolved
to
bear
his
witness
against
them
for
this
purpose
therefore
he
went
all
the
way
to
rome
and
got
into
the
amphitheatre
close
to
the
as
the
place
where
the
gladiators
fought
was
called
and
when
the
fight
had
begun
he
leaped
over
the
barrier
which
separated
him
from
the
arena
rushed
in
between
the
gladiators
and
tried
to
part
them
the
people
who
crowded
the
vast
building
grew
furious
at
being
baulked
of
their
amusement
they
shouted
out
with
rage
and
threw
stones
or
whatever
else
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
at
telemachus
so
that
he
was
soon
pelted
to
death
but
when
they
saw
him
lying
dead
their
anger
suddenly
cooled
and
they
were
struck
with
horror
at
the
crime
of
which
they
had
been
guilty
although
they
had
never
thought
of
the
wickedness
of
feasting
their
eyes
on
the
bloodshed
of
gladiators
the
emperor
said
that
the
death
of
telemachus
was
really
a
martyrdom
and
proposed
to
do
away
with
the
shows
of
gladiators
and
the
people
who
were
now
filled
with
sorrow
and
shame
agreed
to
give
up
their
cruel
diversions
so
the
life
of
the
brave
monk
was
not
thrown
away
since
it
was
the
means
of
saving
the
lives
of
many
and
of
preserving
multitudes
from
the
sin
of
sacrificing
their
for
their
sport

john
chrysostom
part
i
at
this
time
lived
john
chrysostom
whose
name
is
known
to
us
all
from
the
prayer
in
our
service
which
is
called
a
prayer
of
st
chrysostom
he
was
born
at
antioch
about
the
year
while
he
was
still
a
little
child
he
lost
his
father
but
his
mother
anthusa
who
was
left
a
widow
at
the
age
of
twenty
remained
unmarried
and
devoted
herself
to
the
training
of
her
son
during
his
early
years
she
brought
him
up
with
religious
care
and
he
was
afterwards
sent
to
finish
his
education
under
a
famous
heathen
philosopher
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
tell
you
that
christian
youths
while
in
the
schools
of
such
teachers
ran
a
great
risk
of
being
turned
from
the
gospel
and
that
many
of
them
fell
away
but
john
was
preserved
from
the
danger
by
daily
studying
the
scriptures
and
thus
his
faith
was
kept
fresh
and
warm
the
philosopher
had
such
a
high
notion
of
his
talents
that
he
long
after
spoke
of
john
as
the
best
of
all
the
pupils
he
had
ever
had
and
said
that
he
would
have
been
the
worthiest
to
succeed
him
as
a
teacher
if
the
christians
had
not
stolen
him
page
when
he
left
this
master
john
studied
law
but
after
trying
it
for
a
time
he
found
that
there
were
things
about
the
business
of
an
antioch
lawyer
which
went
against
his
conscience
so
he
resolved
to
give
up
the
law
and
to
become
a
monk
but
his
mother
thought
that
he
might
lead
a
really
christian
life
without
rushing
away
into
the
wilderness
and
leaving
his
natural
duties
behind
him
she
took
him
by
the
hand
led
him
into
her
chamber
and
made
him
sit
down
beside
her
on
the
bed
then
she
burst
into
tears
she
reminded
him
of
all
the
kindness
which
she
had
shown
him
and
of
the
cares
and
troubles
which
she
had
borne
for
his
sake
she
told
him
that
it
had
been
her
chief
comfort
to
look
on
his
face
which
put
her
in
mind
of
the
husband
whom
she
had
lost
make
me
not
once
more
a
widow
she
said
wait
only
for
my
death
which
may
perhaps
not
be
far
off
when
you
have
laid
me
in
the
grave
then
you
may
go
where
you
will
even
beyond
the
sea
if
such
be
your
wish
but
so
long
as
i
live
bear
to
stay
with
me
and
do
not
offend
god
by
afflicting
your
mother
the
young
man
yielded
to
these
entreaties
and
remained
in
his
mother
house
although
he
gave
up
all
worldly
business
and
lived
after
the
strict
manner
of
the
monks
but
when
the
good
anthusa
was
dead
he
withdrew
to
the
mountains
near
antioch
in
which
a
great
number
of
monks
dwelt
there
he
spent
four
years
in
a
monastery
and
two
as
a
hermit
in
a
cave
but
at
last
his
hard
life
made
him
very
weak
and
ill
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
antioch
and
soon
after
this
he
was
ordained
to
be
one
of
the
clergy
and
was
appointed
chief
preacher
of
the
city
of
all
the
great
men
of
the
ancient
church
john
was
the
most
famous
for
eloquence
and
from
this
it
was
that
he
got
the
name
of
which
means
his
sermons
of
which
hundreds
still
remain
were
not
mere
displays
of
fine
words
but
were
always
meant
to
instruct
and
to
improve
those
who
heard
them
and
while
he
was
chief
preacher
at
antioch
he
had
a
very
remarkable
opportunity
of
using
his
gifts
of
speech
an
outbreak
had
taken
place
in
the
city
on
account
of
a
new
tax
which
theodosius
who
was
then
emperor
had
laid
on
the
people
the
statues
of
the
emperor
and
of
his
family
which
stood
in
public
places
were
thrown
down
and
were
dragged
about
the
streets
with
all
sorts
of
mockery
and
insult
but
the
riot
was
easily
put
down
and
then
the
inhabitants
began
to
be
in
great
anxiety
and
terror
as
to
the
punishment
which
theodosius
might
inflict
on
them
for
although
the
frightful
massacre
of
thessalonica
had
not
at
that
time
taken
place
they
knew
that
the
emperor
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
that
his
fits
of
anger
were
terrible
they
expected
that
they
might
be
given
up
to
slaughter
and
their
city
to
destruction
for
a
time
few
of
them
ventured
out
of
their
houses
and
those
few
slunk
along
the
streets
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
being
seized
many
were
imprisoned
and
were
cruelly
tortured
or
put
to
death
others
ran
away
leaving
all
that
they
had
behind
them
and
the
public
amusements
of
which
the
people
of
antioch
were
excessively
fond
were
for
a
time
quite
given
up
page
the
bishop
flavian
who
was
a
very
aged
man
in
bad
health
and
infirm
left
the
bedside
of
his
sister
who
was
supposed
to
be
dying
to
set
out
for
constantinople
and
implore
the
emperor
mercy
and
while
he
was
absent
chrysostom
took
the
lead
among
the
clergy
he
preached
every
day
in
a
solemn
and
awakening
tone
he
tried
to
turn
the
terrors
of
the
people
to
their
lasting
good
by
directing
their
thoughts
to
the
great
judgment
in
which
all
men
must
hereafter
appear
and
urging
them
whatever
their
present
fate
might
be
to
strive
after
peace
with
god
and
a
share
in
his
mercy
through
christ
in
that
awful
day
the
effect
of
this
preaching
was
wonderful
day
after
day
vast
crowds
flocked
to
listen
to
it
forgetting
every
thing
else
even
many
heathens
were
among
them
the
news
of
the
disturbances
at
antioch
had
reached
constantinople
long
before
flavian
and
the
bishop
as
he
was
on
his
way
met
two
commissioners
who
had
been
sent
by
the
emperor
to
declare
his
sentence
to
the
people
the
buildings
of
the
city
were
to
be
spared
but
it
was
to
lose
its
rank
among
the
cities
of
the
empire
the
baths
which
in
those
countries
were
reckoned
almost
as
a
necessary
of
life
were
to
be
shut
up
and
all
public
amusements
were
to
be
at
an
end
the
officers
after
reaching
antioch
and
publishing
this
sentence
set
about
inquiring
who
had
taken
a
part
in
the
tumult
judgment
was
to
be
executed
without
mercy
on
all
whose
guilt
could
be
proved
and
the
anxiety
of
the
people
became
extreme
a
number
of
monks
and
hermits
came
down
from
the
mountains
and
busied
themselves
in
trying
to
comfort
those
who
were
in
distress
one
of
these
monks
macedonius
a
man
of
rough
and
simple
appearance
but
of
great
note
for
holiness
met
the
emperor
commissioners
as
they
were
riding
through
the
whereupon
he
laid
hold
of
one
of
them
by
the
cloak
and
desired
them
both
to
dismount
at
first
they
were
angry
but
on
being
told
who
he
was
they
alighted
and
fell
on
their
knees
before
him
for
in
those
days
monks
famous
for
their
holiness
were
looked
on
much
as
if
they
had
been
prophets
and
macedonius
spoke
to
them
in
the
tone
of
a
prophet
go
he
said
say
to
the
emperor
you
are
a
man
your
subjects
too
are
men
made
in
the
image
of
god
you
are
enraged
on
account
of
images
of
brass
but
a
living
and
reasonable
image
is
of
far
higher
worth
than
these
destroy
the
brazen
images
and
it
is
easy
to
make
others
but
you
can
not
restore
a
single
hair
of
the
heads
of
the
men
whom
you
have
put
to
death
the
commissioners
were
much
struck
with
the
way
in
which
macedonius
uttered
this
although
they
did
not
understand
what
he
said
as
he
spoke
in
the
syrian
language
and
when
his
words
were
explained
to
them
in
greek
they
agreed
that
one
of
them
should
go
to
the
emperor
to
tell
him
how
things
were
at
antioch
and
to
beg
for
further
instructions
in
the
mean
time
bishop
flavian
had
made
his
way
to
the
presence
theodosius
received
him
with
kindness
and
spoke
calmly
of
the
favour
which
he
had
always
shown
to
antioch
and
of
the
base
return
which
the
citizens
had
made
for
it
the
bishop
wept
bitterly
when
he
heard
this
he
owned
that
his
flock
had
deserved
the
worst
of
punishments
but
he
said
no
punishment
could
be
so
severe
as
undeserved
mercy
he
told
the
emperor
that
instead
of
the
statues
which
had
been
thrown
down
he
had
now
the
opportunity
of
setting
up
far
better
monuments
in
the
hearts
of
his
people
by
showing
them
forgiveness
he
urged
the
duty
of
forgiveness
in
all
the
ways
that
he
could
think
of
he
drew
a
moving
picture
of
the
misery
of
the
inhabitants
of
antioch
which
he
could
not
bear
to
see
again
and
he
declared
that
unless
he
gained
the
favour
which
he
had
come
to
beg
for
he
would
never
return
to
his
city
theodosius
was
moved
almost
to
tears
by
the
old
man
words
what
wonder
is
it
he
said
if
i
who
am
but
a
man
should
pardon
my
when
the
maker
of
the
world
has
come
on
earth
and
has
submitted
to
death
for
the
forgiveness
of
mankind
and
he
pressed
flavian
to
return
to
antioch
with
all
speed
for
the
comfort
of
his
people
the
bishop
on
reaching
home
found
that
his
sister
whom
he
had
not
hoped
to
see
any
more
in
this
world
was
recovered
and
we
may
well
imagine
that
his
flock
were
full
of
gratitude
to
him
for
what
he
had
done
but
he
refused
all
thanks
or
credit
on
account
of
the
success
of
his
mission
it
was
not
my
doing
he
said
it
was
god
who
softened
the
emperor
heart
part
ii
when
chrysostom
had
been
chief
preacher
of
antioch
about
twelve
years
the
bishopric
of
constantinople
fell
vacant
and
there
was
so
much
strife
for
it
that
at
length
the
people
as
the
only
way
of
settling
the
matter
quietly
begged
the
emperor
arcadius
to
name
a
bishop
for
them
now
it
happened
that
the
emperor
favourite
counsellor
eutropius
had
been
at
antioch
a
short
time
before
and
had
been
very
much
struck
with
chrysostom
preaching
so
he
advised
the
emperor
to
choose
him
chrysostom
was
appointed
accordingly
and
as
he
was
so
much
beloved
by
the
people
of
antioch
that
they
might
perhaps
have
made
a
disturbance
rather
than
part
with
him
he
was
decoyed
outside
the
city
and
was
then
secretly
sent
off
to
constantinople
eutropius
was
so
worthless
a
man
that
we
can
hardly
suppose
him
to
have
acted
from
quite
pure
motives
in
this
affair
perhaps
he
wished
to
get
credit
with
the
people
for
making
so
good
a
choice
perhaps
too
he
may
have
hoped
that
he
might
be
able
to
do
as
he
liked
with
a
bishop
of
his
own
choosing
but
if
he
thought
so
he
was
much
disappointed
for
chrysostom
behaved
as
a
faithful
and
true
pastor
without
any
fear
of
man
the
new
bishop
preaching
was
as
much
admired
at
constantinople
as
it
had
been
at
antioch
and
he
soon
gained
great
influence
among
his
flock
and
besides
attending
diligently
to
his
work
at
home
he
set
on
foot
missions
to
some
heathen
nations
and
also
to
the
goths
who
as
we
have
seen
were
arians
but
besides
the
goths
at
a
distance
there
were
then
a
great
number
of
the
same
people
at
constantinople
for
the
greeks
and
romans
of
those
days
were
so
much
fallen
away
from
the
bravery
of
their
forefathers
that
the
emperors
were
obliged
to
hire
gothic
soldiers
to
defend
their
dominions
chrysostom
therefore
took
great
pains
to
bring
over
these
goths
at
constantinople
to
the
church
he
ordained
clergy
of
their
own
nation
for
them
and
set
apart
a
church
for
them
and
he
often
went
himself
to
this
church
and
preached
to
them
in
greek
while
an
interpreter
repeated
his
words
to
them
in
their
own
language
page
but
unhappily
he
soon
made
enemies
at
constantinople
for
he
found
the
church
there
in
a
very
bad
state
and
in
trying
to
set
things
right
he
gave
offence
to
many
people
of
various
kinds
and
although
he
was
indeed
an
excellent
man
perhaps
he
did
not
always
act
with
such
wisdom
and
such
calmness
of
temper
as
might
have
been
wished
the
last
bishop
nectarius
was
a
man
of
high
rank
who
had
never
dreamt
of
being
a
bishop
or
any
such
thing
until
at
the
council
of
constantinople
he
was
suddenly
chosen
instead
of
the
good
gregory
at
that
time
nectarius
was
not
even
baptized
so
that
he
had
first
to
receive
baptism
and
then
within
a
week
he
was
consecrated
as
bishop
of
the
second
church
in
the
whole
christian
world
and
it
proved
that
he
was
too
old
to
change
his
ways
very
much
he
continued
to
live
in
a
costly
style
as
he
had
done
all
his
life
before
and
he
let
the
clergy
go
on
much
as
they
pleased
so
that
they
generally
fell
into
easy
and
luxurious
habits
and
some
of
them
were
even
quite
scandalous
in
their
conduct
now
chrysostom
ways
and
notions
were
quite
opposite
to
all
this
he
sold
the
rich
carpets
and
other
valuable
furniture
which
he
found
in
the
bishop
palace
nay
he
even
sold
some
of
the
church
ornaments
that
he
might
get
money
for
building
hospitals
and
for
other
charitable
purposes
he
did
not
care
for
company
and
his
health
was
delicate
and
for
these
reasons
he
always
took
his
meals
by
himself
and
did
not
ask
bishops
who
came
to
constantinople
to
lodge
in
his
palace
or
to
dine
with
him
as
nectarius
had
done
this
does
not
seem
to
be
quite
according
to
paul
saying
that
a
bishop
should
be
given
to
hospitality
iii
but
chrysostom
thought
that
among
the
christians
of
a
great
city
like
constantinople
the
strange
bishops
could
be
at
no
loss
for
entertainment
and
that
his
own
time
and
money
might
be
better
spent
than
in
entertaining
them
but
many
of
them
were
very
much
offended
and
it
is
said
that
one
acacius
of
berrhoea
in
syria
declared
in
anger
i
will
cook
his
pot
for
him
see
page
chrysostom
reforms
also
interfered
much
with
the
habits
of
his
clergy
he
made
them
perform
service
at
night
in
their
churches
for
people
who
were
too
busy
to
attend
during
the
day
and
many
of
them
were
very
unwilling
to
leave
their
homes
at
late
hours
and
to
do
additional
work
some
of
them
too
were
envious
of
him
because
he
was
so
famous
as
a
preacher
and
they
looked
eagerly
to
find
something
in
his
sermons
which
might
be
turned
against
him
and
besides
all
these
enemies
among
the
clergy
he
provoked
many
among
the
courtiers
and
the
rich
people
of
constantinople
by
plainly
attacking
their
vices
although
chrysostom
had
chiefly
owed
his
bishopric
to
eutropius
he
was
afterwards
drawn
into
many
disputes
with
him
for
in
that
age
and
in
that
country
things
were
very
different
from
what
they
happily
are
among
ourselves
and
a
person
in
power
like
eutropius
might
commit
great
acts
of
tyranny
and
oppression
while
the
poor
people
who
suffered
had
no
means
of
redress
but
many
of
those
whom
eutropius
meant
to
plunder
or
to
imprison
took
refuge
in
churches
where
debtors
and
others
were
then
considered
to
be
safe
as
it
was
not
lawful
to
seize
them
in
the
holy
buildings
eutropius
persuaded
the
emperor
to
make
a
law
by
which
this
right
of
shelter
or
as
it
was
called
was
taken
away
from
churches
but
soon
after
he
himself
fell
into
disgrace
and
in
his
terror
he
rushed
to
the
cathedral
and
laid
hold
of
the
altar
for
protection
some
soldiers
were
sent
to
seize
him
but
chrysostom
would
not
let
them
enter
and
next
day
when
the
church
was
crowded
by
a
multitude
of
people
who
had
flocked
to
see
what
would
become
of
eutropius
the
bishop
preached
on
the
uncertainty
of
all
earthly
greatness
while
eutropius
lay
crouching
under
the
holy
table
chrysostom
turned
to
him
and
reminded
him
how
he
had
tried
to
take
away
that
very
privilege
of
churches
from
which
he
was
now
seeking
protection
and
he
desired
the
people
to
beg
both
god
and
the
emperor
to
pardon
the
fallen
favourite
by
all
this
he
did
not
mean
to
insult
the
wretched
eutropius
but
to
turn
the
rage
of
the
multitude
into
pity
it
was
said
however
by
some
that
he
had
triumphed
over
his
misfortunes
and
he
also
got
into
trouble
for
giving
eutropius
shelter
and
was
carried
before
the
emperor
to
answer
for
doing
so
but
the
bishop
boldly
upheld
the
right
of
the
church
to
protect
the
defenceless
and
eutropius
was
for
the
time
allowed
to
go
free
part
iii
thus
there
were
many
at
constantinople
who
were
ready
to
take
part
against
chrysostom
if
an
opportunity
should
offer
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
found
one
the
bishop
of
alexandria
at
this
time
was
a
bold
and
bad
man
named
theophilus
he
was
jealous
of
the
see
of
constantinople
because
the
second
general
council
had
lately
placed
it
above
his
own
he
disliked
the
bishop
because
he
had
hoped
to
put
one
of
his
own
clergy
into
the
place
and
had
seen
enough
of
chrysostom
at
his
first
meeting
to
know
that
he
could
not
make
a
tool
of
him
and
although
he
had
been
obliged
by
the
emperor
and
eutropius
to
consecrate
chrysostom
as
bishop
it
was
with
a
very
bad
grace
that
he
did
so
see
page
there
were
then
great
quarrels
as
to
the
opinions
of
the
famous
origen
who
had
lived
two
hundred
years
before
some
of
his
opinions
were
really
wrong
and
others
were
very
strange
if
they
were
not
wrong
too
but
besides
these
a
number
of
things
had
been
laid
to
his
charge
of
which
he
seems
to
have
been
quite
innocent
if
theophilus
really
cared
at
all
about
the
matter
he
was
in
his
heart
favourable
to
origen
but
he
found
it
convenient
to
take
the
opposite
side
and
he
cruelly
persecuted
such
of
the
egyptian
monks
as
were
said
to
be
touched
with
origen
errors
the
chief
of
these
monks
were
four
brothers
called
the
or
one
of
them
was
that
same
ammonius
who
cut
off
his
ear
and
was
ready
to
cut
out
his
tongue
rather
than
be
a
bishop
theophilus
had
made
much
of
these
brothers
and
had
employed
two
of
them
in
managing
his
accounts
but
these
two
found
out
such
practices
of
his
in
money
matters
as
quite
shocked
them
and
as
after
this
they
refused
to
stay
with
the
bishop
any
longer
he
charged
them
and
their
brothers
with
origenism
as
the
following
of
origen
opinions
was
called
they
denied
that
they
held
any
of
the
errors
which
theophilus
laid
to
their
charge
but
he
went
with
soldiers
into
the
desert
hunted
out
the
brothers
destroyed
their
cells
burnt
a
number
of
books
and
even
killed
some
persons
the
tall
brothers
and
some
of
their
friends
fled
into
the
holy
land
but
their
enemy
had
power
enough
to
prevent
their
remaining
there
and
they
then
sought
a
refuge
at
constantinople
see
chapter
vii
see
page
on
hearing
of
their
arrival
in
his
city
chrysostom
inquired
about
them
and
finding
that
they
bore
a
good
character
he
treated
them
kindly
but
he
would
not
admit
them
to
communion
until
he
knew
what
theophilus
had
to
say
against
them
theophilus
however
was
told
that
chrysostom
admitted
them
and
he
wrote
a
furious
letter
to
him
about
it
the
brothers
were
very
much
alarmed
lest
they
should
be
turned
away
at
constantinople
as
they
had
been
in
the
holy
land
and
one
day
when
the
empress
eudoxia
was
in
a
church
they
went
to
her
and
entreated
her
to
get
the
emperor
leave
that
a
council
might
be
held
to
examine
their
case
theophilus
was
summoned
to
appear
before
this
council
and
give
an
account
of
his
behaviour
to
the
brothers
but
when
he
got
to
constantinople
he
acted
as
if
instead
of
being
under
a
charge
of
misbehaviour
himself
he
had
been
called
to
judge
the
bishop
of
the
capital
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
chrysostom
he
spent
large
sums
of
money
in
bribing
courtiers
and
others
to
favour
his
own
side
and
when
he
thought
he
had
made
all
sure
he
held
a
meeting
of
six
and
thirty
bishops
at
a
place
called
the
oak
which
lay
on
the
asiatic
shore
opposite
to
constantinople
a
number
of
trumpery
charges
were
brought
against
chrysostom
and
as
he
refused
to
appear
before
such
a
meeting
which
was
almost
entirely
made
up
of
egyptian
bishops
and
had
no
right
whatever
to
try
him
they
found
him
guilty
of
various
offences
and
among
the
rest
of
high
treason
the
emperor
and
empress
had
been
drawn
into
taking
part
against
him
and
he
was
condemned
to
banishment
but
on
the
night
after
he
had
been
sent
across
the
bosphorus
the
strait
which
divides
constantinople
from
the
asiatic
shore
the
city
was
shaken
by
an
earthquake
the
empress
in
her
terror
supposed
this
to
be
a
judgment
against
the
injustice
which
had
been
committed
and
hastily
sent
off
a
messenger
to
beg
that
the
bishop
would
return
and
when
it
was
known
next
day
that
he
was
on
his
way
back
so
great
was
the
joy
of
his
flock
that
the
bosphorus
was
covered
with
vessels
carrying
vast
multitudes
of
people
who
eagerly
crowded
to
welcome
him
part
iv
within
a
few
months
after
his
return
chrysostom
again
got
into
trouble
for
finding
fault
with
some
disorderly
and
almost
heathenish
rejoicings
which
were
held
around
a
new
statue
of
the
empress
close
to
the
door
of
his
cathedral
theophilus
had
returned
to
egypt
and
did
not
again
appear
at
constantinople
but
directed
the
proceedings
of
other
enemies
who
were
on
the
spot
another
council
was
held
and
of
course
found
the
bishop
guilty
of
whatever
was
laid
to
his
charge
he
did
not
mean
to
desert
his
flock
unless
he
were
forced
to
do
so
he
therefore
kept
possession
of
the
cathedral
and
of
the
episcopal
house
for
some
months
during
this
time
he
was
often
disturbed
by
his
enemies
nay
more
than
once
attempts
were
even
made
to
murder
him
at
last
on
receiving
an
order
from
the
emperor
to
leave
his
house
he
saw
that
the
time
was
come
when
he
must
yield
to
force
his
flock
guarded
the
cathedral
day
and
night
and
would
have
resisted
any
attempt
to
seize
him
but
he
did
not
think
it
right
to
risk
disorder
and
bloodshed
he
therefore
took
a
solemn
leave
of
his
chief
friends
giving
good
advice
and
speaking
words
of
comfort
to
each
he
begged
them
not
to
despair
for
the
loss
of
him
but
to
submit
to
any
bishop
who
should
be
chosen
by
general
consent
to
succeed
him
and
then
while
in
order
to
take
off
the
people
attention
his
mule
was
held
at
one
door
of
the
church
as
if
he
might
be
expected
to
come
out
there
he
quietly
left
the
building
by
another
door
and
gave
himself
up
as
a
prisoner
declaring
that
he
wished
his
case
to
be
fairly
tried
by
a
council
he
was
first
carried
to
nicæa
where
he
remained
nearly
a
month
during
this
time
he
pressed
for
a
fresh
inquiry
into
his
conduct
but
in
vain
and
neither
he
nor
his
friends
could
obtain
leave
for
him
to
retire
to
some
place
where
he
might
live
with
comfort
he
was
sentenced
to
be
carried
to
cucusus
among
the
mountains
of
taurus
a
name
which
seemed
to
bode
him
no
good
as
an
earlier
bishop
of
constantinople
paul
had
been
starved
and
afterwards
strangled
there
in
the
time
of
the
arian
troubles
on
his
way
to
cucusus
he
was
often
in
danger
from
robbers
who
infested
the
road
and
still
more
from
monks
of
the
opposite
party
who
were
furious
against
him
when
he
arrived
at
the
place
he
found
it
a
wretched
little
town
where
he
was
frozen
by
cold
in
winter
and
parched
by
excessive
heat
in
summer
sometimes
he
could
hardly
get
provisions
and
when
he
was
ill
as
often
happened
he
could
not
get
proper
medicines
sometimes
too
the
robbers
from
the
neighbouring
country
of
isauria
made
plundering
attacks
so
that
chrysostom
was
obliged
to
leave
cucusus
in
haste
and
to
take
refuge
in
a
castle
called
arabissus
but
although
there
was
much
to
distress
him
in
his
banishment
there
was
also
much
to
comfort
him
his
great
name
his
sufferings
and
his
innocence
were
known
throughout
all
christian
churches
letters
of
consolation
and
sympathy
poured
in
on
him
from
all
quarters
the
bishop
of
rome
himself
wrote
to
him
as
to
an
equal
and
even
the
emperor
of
the
west
honorius
interceded
for
him
although
without
success
the
bishop
of
cucusus
and
his
other
neighbours
treated
him
with
all
respect
and
kindness
and
many
pilgrims
made
their
way
over
the
rough
mountain
roads
to
see
him
and
to
express
their
reverence
for
him
his
friends
at
a
distance
sent
him
such
large
sums
of
money
that
he
was
able
to
redeem
captives
and
to
support
missions
to
the
goths
and
to
the
persians
and
after
all
had
to
desire
that
they
would
not
send
him
so
much
as
their
gifts
were
more
than
he
could
use
in
truth
no
part
of
his
life
was
so
full
of
honour
and
of
influence
as
the
three
years
which
he
spent
in
exile
at
length
the
court
became
jealous
of
the
interest
which
was
so
generally
felt
in
chrysostom
and
he
was
suddenly
hurried
off
from
cucusus
with
the
intention
of
removing
him
to
a
still
wilder
and
more
desolate
place
at
the
farthest
border
of
the
empire
he
had
to
travel
rapidly
in
the
height
of
summer
and
the
great
heat
renewed
the
ailments
from
which
he
had
often
suffered
at
length
he
became
so
ill
that
he
felt
his
end
to
be
near
and
desired
the
soldiers
who
had
the
charge
of
him
to
stop
at
a
town
called
comana
there
he
exchanged
his
mean
travelling
dress
for
the
best
which
he
possessed
he
once
more
received
the
sacrament
of
his
saviour
body
and
blood
and
after
uttering
the
words
glory
be
to
god
for
all
things
with
his
last
breath
he
added
amen
september
thirty
years
after
this
chrysostom
body
was
removed
to
constantinople
when
the
vessel
which
conveyed
it
was
seen
leaving
the
asiatic
shore
of
the
bosphorus
a
multitude
far
greater
than
that
which
had
hailed
his
first
return
from
banishment
poured
forth
from
constantinople
in
shipping
and
boats
of
all
kinds
which
covered
the
narrow
strait
and
the
emperor
theodosius
son
of
arcadius
and
eudoxia
bent
humbly
over
the
coffin
and
lamented
with
tears
the
guilt
of
his
parents
in
the
persecution
of
the
great
and
holy
bishop

augustine
part
i
the
church
in
the
north
of
africa
has
hardly
been
mentioned
since
the
time
of
st
cyprian
but
we
must
now
look
towards
it
again
since
in
the
days
of
chrysostom
it
produced
a
man
who
was
perhaps
the
greatest
of
all
the
old
christian
fathers
augustine
chapter
viii
augustine
was
born
at
thagaste
a
city
of
numidia
in
the
year
his
mother
monica
was
a
pious
christian
but
his
father
patricius
was
a
heathen
and
a
man
of
no
very
good
character
monica
was
resolved
to
bring
up
her
son
in
the
true
faith
she
entered
him
as
a
catechumen
of
the
church
when
a
little
child
and
carefully
taught
him
as
much
of
religious
things
as
a
child
could
learn
but
he
was
not
then
baptized
because
as
has
been
mentioned
already
people
were
accustomed
in
those
days
to
put
off
baptism
out
of
fear
lest
they
should
afterwards
fall
into
sin
and
so
should
lose
the
blessing
of
the
sacrament
this
as
we
know
was
a
mistake
but
it
was
a
very
common
practice
nevertheless
page
when
augustine
was
a
boy
he
was
one
day
suddenly
taken
ill
so
that
he
seemed
likely
to
die
remembering
what
his
mother
had
taught
him
he
begged
that
he
might
be
baptized
and
preparations
were
made
for
the
purpose
but
all
at
once
he
began
to
grow
better
and
the
baptism
was
put
off
for
the
same
reason
as
before
as
he
grew
up
he
gave
but
little
promise
of
what
he
was
afterwards
to
become
much
of
his
time
was
spent
in
idleness
and
through
idleness
he
fell
into
bad
company
and
was
drawn
into
sins
of
many
kinds
when
he
was
about
seventeen
his
father
died
the
good
monica
had
been
much
troubled
by
her
husband
heathenism
and
misconduct
and
had
earnestly
tried
to
convert
him
from
his
errors
she
went
about
this
wisely
not
lecturing
him
or
arguing
with
him
in
a
way
that
might
have
set
him
more
against
the
gospel
but
trying
rather
to
show
him
the
beauty
of
christian
faith
by
her
own
loving
gentle
and
dutiful
behaviour
and
at
length
her
pains
were
rewarded
by
seeing
him
before
his
death
profess
himself
a
believer
and
receive
christian
baptism
monica
was
left
rather
badly
off
at
her
husband
death
but
a
rich
neighbour
was
kind
enough
to
help
her
in
the
expense
of
finishing
her
son
education
and
the
young
man
himself
now
began
to
show
something
of
the
great
talents
which
god
had
been
pleased
to
bestow
on
him
unhappily
however
he
sank
deeper
and
deeper
in
vice
and
poor
monica
was
bitterly
grieved
by
his
ways
a
book
which
he
happened
to
read
led
him
to
feel
something
of
the
shamefulness
and
wretchedness
of
his
courses
but
as
it
was
a
heathen
book
although
written
by
one
of
the
wisest
of
the
heathens
cicero
it
could
not
show
him
by
what
means
he
might
be
able
to
reach
to
a
higher
life
he
looked
into
scripture
in
the
hope
of
finding
instruction
there
but
he
was
now
in
that
state
of
mind
to
which
as
paul
says
i
the
preaching
of
christ
sounds
like
foolishness
so
that
he
fancied
himself
to
be
above
learning
anything
from
a
book
so
plain
and
homely
as
the
bible
then
seemed
to
him
and
he
set
out
in
search
of
some
other
teaching
and
a
very
strange
sort
of
teaching
he
met
with
about
a
hundred
years
before
this
time
a
man
named
manes
appeared
in
persia
and
preached
a
religion
which
he
pretended
to
have
received
from
heaven
but
which
was
really
made
up
by
himself
from
a
mixture
of
christian
and
heathen
notions
it
was
something
like
the
doctrines
which
had
been
before
taught
by
the
gnostics
and
was
as
wild
nonsense
as
can
well
be
imagined
he
taught
that
there
were
two
gods
a
good
god
of
light
and
a
bad
god
of
darkness
and
he
divided
his
followers
into
two
classes
the
lower
of
which
were
called
while
the
higher
were
called
these
were
supposed
to
be
very
strict
in
their
lives
they
were
not
to
eat
flesh
at
all
they
might
not
even
gather
the
fruits
of
the
earth
or
pluck
a
herb
with
their
own
hands
they
were
supported
and
were
served
by
the
hearers
and
they
took
a
very
odd
way
of
showing
their
gratitude
to
these
for
it
is
said
that
when
one
of
the
elect
ate
a
piece
of
bread
he
made
this
speech
to
it
it
was
not
i
who
reaped
or
ground
or
baked
thee
may
they
who
did
so
be
reaped
and
ground
and
baked
in
their
turn
and
it
was
believed
that
the
poor
hearers
would
after
death
become
corn
and
have
to
go
through
the
mill
and
the
oven
until
they
should
have
suffered
enough
to
clear
away
their
offences
and
make
them
fit
for
the
blessedness
of
the
elect
page
the
manichæans
as
the
followers
of
manes
were
called
soon
found
their
way
into
africa
where
they
gained
many
converts
and
although
laws
were
often
made
against
their
heresy
by
the
emperors
it
continued
to
spread
secretly
for
they
used
to
hide
their
opinions
when
there
was
any
danger
so
that
persons
who
were
really
manichæans
pretended
to
be
catholic
christians
and
there
was
some
of
them
even
among
the
monks
and
clergy
of
the
church
in
the
humour
in
which
augustine
now
was
this
strange
sect
took
his
fancy
for
the
manichæans
pretended
to
be
wiser
than
any
one
else
and
laughed
at
all
submission
to
doctrines
which
had
been
settled
by
the
church
so
augustine
at
twenty
became
a
manichæan
and
for
nine
years
was
one
of
the
hearers
for
he
never
got
to
be
one
of
the
elect
or
to
know
much
about
their
secrets
but
before
he
had
been
very
long
in
the
sect
he
began
to
notice
some
things
which
shocked
him
in
the
behaviour
of
the
elect
who
professed
the
greatest
strictness
in
short
he
could
not
but
see
that
their
strictness
was
all
a
pretence
and
that
they
were
really
a
very
worthless
set
of
men
and
he
found
out
too
that
besides
bad
conduct
there
was
a
great
deal
very
bad
and
disgusting
in
the
opinions
of
the
manichæans
which
he
had
not
known
of
at
first
after
learning
all
this
he
did
not
know
what
to
turn
to
and
he
seems
for
a
time
to
have
believed
nothing
at
all
which
is
a
wretched
state
of
mind
indeed
and
so
he
found
it
part
ii
augustine
now
set
up
as
a
teacher
at
carthage
the
chief
city
of
africa
but
among
the
students
there
he
found
a
set
of
wild
young
men
who
called
themselves
a
name
which
meant
that
they
turned
everything
and
augustine
was
so
much
troubled
by
the
behaviour
of
these
unruly
lads
that
he
resolved
to
leave
carthage
and
go
to
rome
monica
as
we
may
easily
suppose
had
been
much
distressed
by
his
wanderings
but
she
never
ceased
to
pray
that
he
might
be
brought
round
again
one
day
she
went
to
a
learned
bishop
who
was
much
in
the
habit
of
arguing
with
people
who
were
in
error
and
begged
that
he
would
speak
to
her
son
but
the
good
man
understood
augustine
case
and
saw
that
to
talk
to
him
while
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
mind
would
only
make
him
more
than
he
was
already
let
him
alone
awhile
he
said
only
pray
god
for
him
and
he
will
of
himself
find
out
by
reading
how
wrong
the
manichæans
are
and
how
impious
their
doctrine
is
and
then
he
told
her
that
he
had
himself
been
brought
up
as
a
manichæan
but
that
his
studies
had
shown
him
the
error
of
the
sect
and
he
had
left
it
monica
was
not
satisfied
with
this
and
went
on
begging
even
with
tears
that
the
bishop
would
talk
with
her
son
but
he
said
to
her
go
thy
ways
and
may
god
bless
thee
for
it
is
not
possible
that
the
child
of
so
many
tears
should
perish
and
monica
took
his
words
as
if
they
had
been
a
voice
from
heaven
and
cherished
the
hope
which
they
held
out
to
her
monica
was
much
against
augustine
plan
of
removing
to
rome
but
he
slipped
away
and
went
on
shipboard
while
she
was
praying
in
a
chapel
by
the
seaside
which
was
called
after
the
name
of
cyprian
having
got
to
rome
he
opened
a
school
there
as
he
had
done
at
carthage
but
he
found
that
the
roman
youth
although
they
were
not
so
rough
as
those
of
carthage
had
another
very
awkward
habit
namely
that
after
having
heard
a
number
of
his
lectures
they
disappeared
without
paying
for
them
while
he
was
in
distress
on
this
account
the
office
of
a
public
teacher
at
milan
was
offered
to
him
and
he
was
very
glad
to
take
it
while
at
rome
he
had
a
bad
illness
but
he
did
not
at
that
time
wish
or
ask
for
baptism
as
he
had
done
when
sick
in
his
childhood
the
great
ambrose
was
then
bishop
of
milan
augustine
had
heard
so
much
of
his
fame
that
he
went
often
to
hear
him
out
of
curiosity
to
know
whether
the
bishop
were
really
as
fine
a
preacher
as
he
was
said
to
be
but
by
degrees
as
he
listened
he
felt
a
greater
and
greater
interest
he
found
from
what
ambrose
said
that
the
objections
by
which
the
manichæans
had
set
him
against
the
gospel
were
all
mistaken
and
when
monica
joined
him
after
he
had
been
some
time
at
milan
she
had
the
delight
of
finding
that
he
had
given
up
the
manichæan
sect
and
was
once
more
a
catechumen
of
the
church
augustine
had
still
to
fight
his
way
through
many
difficulties
he
had
learnt
that
the
best
and
highest
wisdom
of
the
heathens
could
not
satisfy
his
mind
and
heart
and
he
now
turned
again
to
epistles
and
found
that
scripture
was
something
very
different
from
what
he
had
supposed
it
to
be
in
the
pride
of
his
youth
he
was
filled
with
grief
and
shame
on
account
of
the
vileness
of
his
past
life
and
these
feelings
were
made
still
stronger
by
the
accounts
which
a
friend
gave
him
of
the
strict
and
ways
of
antony
and
other
monks
one
day
as
he
lay
in
the
garden
of
his
lodging
with
his
mind
tossed
to
and
fro
by
anxious
thoughts
so
that
he
even
wept
in
his
distress
he
heard
a
voice
like
that
of
a
child
singing
over
and
over
take
up
and
read
take
up
and
read
at
first
he
fancied
that
the
voice
came
from
some
child
at
play
but
he
could
not
think
of
any
childish
game
in
which
such
words
were
used
and
then
he
remembered
how
antony
had
been
struck
by
the
words
of
the
gospel
which
he
heard
in
church
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
voice
wherever
it
might
come
from
was
a
call
of
the
same
kind
to
himself
so
he
eagerly
seized
the
book
of
epistles
which
was
lying
by
him
and
as
he
opened
it
the
first
words
on
which
his
eyes
fell
were
these
let
us
walk
honestly
as
in
the
day
not
in
rioting
and
drunkenness
not
in
chambering
and
wantonness
not
in
strife
and
envying
but
put
ye
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
make
not
provision
for
the
flesh
to
fulfil
the
lusts
thereof
xiii
and
as
he
read
the
words
all
at
once
sank
deeply
into
his
heart
and
from
that
moment
he
felt
himself
another
man
as
soon
as
he
could
do
so
without
being
particularly
noticed
he
gave
up
his
office
of
professor
and
went
into
the
country
where
he
spent
some
months
in
the
company
of
his
mother
and
other
friends
and
at
the
following
easter
he
was
baptized
by
ambrose
the
good
monica
had
now
seen
the
desire
of
her
heart
fulfilled
and
she
soon
after
died
in
peace
as
she
was
on
her
way
back
to
africa
in
company
with
her
son
page
augustine
after
her
death
spent
some
time
at
rome
where
he
wrote
a
book
against
the
manichæans
and
then
returning
to
his
native
place
thagaste
he
gave
himself
up
for
three
years
to
devotion
and
study
in
those
days
it
was
not
uncommon
that
persons
who
were
thought
likely
to
be
useful
to
the
church
should
be
seized
on
and
ordained
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
and
if
they
were
expected
to
make
very
strong
objections
their
mouths
were
even
stopped
by
force
now
fame
grew
so
great
that
he
was
afraid
lest
something
of
this
kind
should
be
done
to
him
and
he
did
not
venture
to
let
himself
be
seen
in
any
town
where
the
bishopric
was
vacant
lest
he
should
be
obliged
to
become
bishop
against
his
will
he
thought
however
that
he
was
safe
in
accepting
an
invitation
to
hippo
because
it
was
provided
with
a
bishop
named
valerius
but
as
he
was
one
day
listening
to
the
bishop
sermon
valerius
began
to
say
that
his
church
was
in
want
of
another
presbyter
whereupon
the
people
laid
hold
of
augustine
and
presented
him
to
the
bishop
who
ordained
him
without
heeding
his
objections
and
four
years
later
he
was
consecrated
a
bishop
to
assist
valerius
who
died
soon
after
augustine
was
bishop
of
hippo
for
years
and
although
there
were
many
other
sees
of
greater
importance
in
africa
his
uncommon
talents
and
his
high
character
made
him
the
foremost
man
of
the
african
church
he
was
a
zealous
and
exemplary
bishop
and
he
wrote
a
great
number
of
valuable
books
of
many
kinds
but
the
most
interesting
of
them
all
is
one
which
may
be
read
in
english
and
is
of
no
great
length
namely
the
confessions
in
which
he
gives
an
account
of
the
wanderings
through
which
he
had
been
brought
into
the
way
of
truth
and
peace
and
humbly
gives
thanks
to
god
whose
gracious
providence
had
guarded
and
guided
him
part
iii
augustine
had
a
great
many
disputes
with
heretics
and
others
who
separated
from
the
church
or
tried
to
corrupt
its
doctrine
but
only
two
of
his
controversies
need
be
mentioned
here
one
of
these
was
with
the
donatists
and
the
other
was
with
the
pelagians
the
sect
of
the
donatists
had
arisen
soon
after
the
end
of
the
last
heathen
persecution
and
was
now
nearly
a
hundred
years
old
we
have
seen
that
cyprian
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
people
who
fancied
that
if
a
man
were
put
to
death
or
underwent
any
other
considerable
suffering
for
the
name
of
christ
he
deserved
to
be
held
in
great
honour
and
his
wishes
were
to
be
attended
to
by
other
christians
whatever
his
character
and
motives
might
have
been
the
same
spirit
which
led
to
this
mistake
continued
in
africa
after
cyprian
time
and
thus
when
the
persecution
began
there
under
diocletian
and
maximian
great
numbers
rushed
into
danger
in
the
hope
of
being
put
to
death
and
of
so
obtaining
at
once
the
blessedness
and
the
glory
of
martyrdom
many
of
these
people
were
weary
of
their
lives
or
in
some
other
respect
were
not
of
such
characters
that
they
could
be
reckoned
as
true
christian
martyrs
the
wise
fathers
of
the
church
always
disapproved
of
such
foolhardy
doings
and
would
not
allow
people
who
acted
in
a
way
so
unlike
our
lord
and
his
apostle
paul
to
be
considered
as
martyrs
and
mensurius
who
was
the
bishop
of
carthage
stedfastly
set
his
face
against
all
such
things
see
page
see
chapter
ix
one
of
the
ways
by
which
the
persecutors
hoped
to
put
down
the
gospel
was
to
get
hold
of
all
the
copies
of
the
scriptures
and
to
burn
them
and
they
required
the
clergy
to
deliver
them
up
but
most
of
the
officers
who
had
to
execute
the
orders
of
the
emperors
did
not
know
a
bible
from
any
other
book
and
it
is
said
that
when
some
of
them
came
to
mensurius
and
asked
him
to
deliver
up
his
books
he
gave
them
a
quantity
of
books
written
by
heretics
which
he
had
collected
perhaps
with
the
intention
of
burning
them
himself
and
that
all
the
while
he
had
put
the
scriptures
safely
out
of
the
way
until
the
tyranny
of
the
heathens
should
be
overpast
when
the
persecution
was
at
an
end
some
of
the
party
whom
he
had
offended
by
setting
himself
against
their
wrong
notions
as
to
martyrdom
brought
up
this
matter
against
the
bishop
they
said
that
his
account
of
it
was
false
that
the
books
which
he
had
given
up
were
not
what
he
said
but
that
he
had
really
given
up
the
scriptures
and
that
even
if
his
story
were
true
he
had
done
wrong
in
using
such
deceit
they
gave
the
name
of
or
as
we
should
say
to
those
who
confessed
that
they
had
been
frightened
into
giving
up
the
scriptures
and
they
were
for
showing
no
mercy
to
any
traditor
however
much
he
might
repent
of
his
weakness
this
means
persons
who
or
this
severe
party
then
tried
to
get
up
an
opposition
to
mensurius
they
found
however
that
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
but
when
he
died
and
when
cæcilian
who
had
been
his
archdeacon
and
his
righthand
man
was
chosen
bishop
in
his
stead
these
people
made
a
great
outcry
and
set
up
another
bishop
of
their
own
against
him
all
sorts
of
people
who
had
taken
offence
at
cæcilian
or
mensurius
thought
this
a
fine
opportunity
for
having
their
revenge
and
thus
a
strong
party
was
formed
it
was
greatly
helped
by
the
wealth
of
a
lady
named
lucilla
whom
cæcilian
had
reproved
for
the
superstitious
habit
of
kissing
a
bone
which
she
supposed
to
have
belonged
to
some
martyr
before
communicating
at
the
lord
table
the
first
bishop
of
the
party
was
one
majorinus
who
had
been
a
servant
of
some
sort
to
lucilla
and
when
majorinus
was
dead
they
set
up
a
second
bishop
named
donatus
after
whom
they
were
called
donatists
this
donatus
was
a
clever
and
a
learned
man
and
lived
very
strictly
but
he
was
exceedingly
proud
and
and
used
very
violent
language
against
all
who
differed
from
him
and
his
sect
copied
his
pride
and
bitterness
many
of
them
however
while
they
professed
to
be
extremely
strict
neglected
the
plainer
and
humbler
duties
of
christian
life
the
donatists
said
that
every
member
of
their
sect
must
be
a
saint
whereas
our
lord
himself
had
declared
that
evil
members
would
always
be
mixed
with
the
good
in
his
church
on
earth
like
tares
growing
in
a
field
of
wheat
or
bad
fishes
mixed
with
good
ones
in
a
net
and
that
the
separation
of
the
good
from
the
bad
would
not
take
place
until
the
end
of
the
world
xiii
and
they
said
that
their
own
sect
was
the
only
true
church
of
christ
although
they
had
no
congregations
out
of
africa
except
one
which
was
set
up
to
please
a
rich
lady
in
spain
and
another
at
rome
whenever
they
made
a
convert
from
the
church
they
baptized
him
afresh
as
if
his
former
baptism
were
good
for
nothing
they
pretended
to
work
miracles
and
to
see
visions
and
they
made
a
very
great
deal
of
donatus
himself
so
as
even
to
pay
him
honours
which
ought
not
to
have
been
given
to
any
child
of
man
for
they
sang
hymns
to
him
and
swore
by
his
gray
hairs
shortly
after
constantine
got
possession
of
africa
by
his
victory
over
maxentius
and
declared
liberty
of
religion
to
the
christians
the
donatists
applied
to
him
against
the
catholics
and
it
was
curious
that
they
should
have
been
the
first
to
call
in
the
emperor
as
judge
in
such
a
matter
because
they
were
afterwards
very
violent
against
the
notion
of
an
earthly
sovereign
having
any
right
to
concern
himself
with
the
management
of
religious
affairs
constantine
tried
to
settle
the
question
by
desiring
some
bishops
to
judge
between
the
parties
and
these
bishops
gave
judgment
in
favour
of
the
catholics
the
donatists
were
dissatisfied
and
asked
for
a
new
trial
whereupon
constantine
gathered
a
council
for
the
purpose
at
arles
in
france
this
was
the
greatest
council
that
had
at
that
time
been
seen
there
were
about
two
hundred
bishops
at
it
and
among
them
were
some
from
britain
here
again
the
decision
was
against
the
donatists
and
they
thereupon
begged
the
emperor
himself
to
examine
their
case
which
he
did
and
once
more
condemned
them
some
severe
laws
were
then
made
against
them
their
churches
were
taken
away
many
of
them
were
banished
and
were
deprived
of
all
that
they
had
and
they
were
even
threatened
with
death
although
none
of
them
suffered
it
during
constantine
reign
page
page
the
emperor
after
a
while
saw
that
they
were
growing
wilder
and
wilder
that
punishment
had
no
effect
on
them
except
to
make
them
more
unmanageable
and
that
they
were
not
to
be
treated
as
reasonable
people
he
then
did
away
with
the
laws
against
them
and
tried
to
keep
them
quiet
by
kindness
and
in
the
last
years
of
his
reign
his
hands
were
so
full
of
the
arian
quarrels
nearer
home
that
he
had
little
leisure
to
attend
to
the
affairs
of
the
donatists
part
iv
after
the
death
of
constantius
africa
fell
to
the
share
of
his
youngest
son
constans
who
sent
some
officers
into
the
country
with
orders
to
make
presents
to
the
donatists
in
the
hope
of
thus
bringing
them
to
join
the
church
but
donatus
flew
out
into
a
great
fury
when
he
heard
of
this
what
has
the
emperor
to
do
with
the
church
he
asked
and
he
forbade
the
members
of
his
sect
which
was
what
he
meant
by
the
church
to
touch
any
of
the
money
that
was
offered
to
them
by
this
time
a
stranger
set
of
wild
people
called
had
appeared
among
the
donatists
they
got
their
name
from
two
latin
words
which
mean
the
because
instead
of
maintaining
themselves
by
honest
labour
they
used
to
go
about
like
sturdy
beggars
to
the
cottages
of
the
country
people
and
demand
whatever
they
wanted
they
were
of
the
poorest
class
and
very
ignorant
but
full
of
zeal
for
their
religion
but
instead
of
being
pure
and
peaceable
iii
this
religion
was
fierce
and
savage
and
allowed
them
to
go
on
without
any
check
in
drunkenness
and
all
sorts
of
misconduct
their
women
whom
they
called
sacred
virgins
were
as
bad
as
the
men
or
worse
bands
of
both
sexes
used
to
rove
about
the
country
and
keep
the
peaceable
inhabitants
in
constant
fear
as
they
went
along
they
sang
or
shouted
praises
be
to
god
and
this
song
says
augustine
was
heard
with
greater
dread
than
the
roaring
of
a
lion
at
first
they
thought
that
they
must
not
use
swords
on
account
of
what
our
lord
had
said
to
peter
xxvi
so
they
carried
heavy
clubs
which
they
called
and
with
these
they
used
to
beat
people
and
often
so
severely
as
to
kill
them
but
afterwards
the
circumcellions
got
over
their
scruples
and
armed
themselves
not
only
with
swords
but
with
other
weapons
of
steel
such
as
spears
and
hatchets
they
attacked
and
plundered
the
churches
of
the
catholics
and
the
houses
of
the
clergy
and
they
handled
any
clergyman
whom
they
could
get
hold
of
very
roughly
besides
this
they
were
fond
of
interfering
in
all
sorts
of
affairs
people
did
not
dare
to
ask
for
the
payment
of
debts
or
to
reprove
their
slaves
for
misbehaviour
lest
the
circumcellions
should
be
called
in
upon
them
and
things
got
to
such
a
pass
that
the
officers
of
the
law
were
afraid
to
do
their
duty
but
the
circumcellions
were
as
furious
against
themselves
as
against
others
they
used
to
court
death
in
all
manner
of
ways
sometimes
they
stopped
travellers
on
the
roads
and
desired
to
be
killed
threatening
to
kill
the
travellers
if
they
refused
and
if
they
met
a
judge
going
on
his
rounds
they
threatened
him
with
death
if
he
would
not
hand
them
over
to
his
officers
for
execution
one
judge
whom
they
assailed
in
this
way
played
them
a
pleasant
trick
he
seemed
quite
willing
to
humour
them
and
told
his
officers
to
bind
them
as
if
for
execution
and
when
he
had
thus
made
them
harmless
and
helpless
instead
of
ordering
them
to
be
put
to
death
he
turned
them
loose
leaving
them
to
get
themselves
unbound
as
they
could
many
circumcellions
drowned
themselves
rushed
into
fire
or
threw
themselves
from
rocks
and
were
dashed
to
pieces
but
they
would
not
put
an
end
to
themselves
by
hanging
because
that
was
the
death
of
the
or
traitor
judas
the
donatists
were
not
all
so
mad
as
these
people
and
some
of
their
councils
condemned
the
practice
of
but
it
went
on
nevertheless
and
those
who
made
away
with
themselves
or
got
others
to
kill
them
in
such
ways
as
have
been
mentioned
were
honoured
as
martyrs
by
the
more
violent
part
of
the
sect
constans
made
three
attempts
to
win
over
the
donatists
by
presents
but
they
held
out
against
all
and
when
the
third
attempt
was
made
in
the
year
by
means
of
an
officer
named
macarius
the
circumcellions
broke
out
into
rebellion
and
fought
a
battle
with
the
emperor
troops
in
this
battle
the
donatists
were
defeated
and
two
of
their
bishops
who
had
been
busy
in
stirring
up
the
rebels
were
among
the
slain
macarius
then
required
the
donatists
to
join
the
church
and
threatened
them
with
banishment
if
they
should
refuse
but
they
were
still
obstinate
and
it
would
seem
that
they
were
treated
hardly
by
the
government
although
the
catholic
bishops
tried
to
prevent
it
donatus
himself
and
great
numbers
of
his
followers
were
sent
into
banishment
and
for
a
time
the
sect
appeared
to
have
been
put
down
part
thus
they
remained
until
the
death
of
the
emperor
constantius
and
donatus
had
died
in
the
mean
time
julian
on
succeeding
to
the
empire
gave
leave
to
all
whom
constantius
had
banished
on
account
of
religion
to
return
to
their
homes
but
the
donatists
were
not
the
better
for
this
as
they
had
not
been
banished
by
constantius
but
by
constans
before
constantius
got
possession
of
africa
so
they
petitioned
the
emperor
that
they
might
be
recalled
from
banishment
and
in
their
petition
they
spoke
of
julian
in
a
way
which
disagreed
strangely
with
their
general
defiance
of
governments
and
which
was
especially
ill
suited
for
one
who
had
forsaken
the
christian
faith
and
was
persecuting
it
at
that
very
time
julian
granted
their
request
and
forthwith
they
returned
home
in
great
triumph
and
committed
violent
outrages
against
the
catholics
they
took
possession
of
a
number
of
churches
and
professing
to
consider
everything
that
had
been
used
by
the
catholics
unclean
they
washed
the
pavement
scraped
the
walls
burnt
the
melted
the
plate
and
cast
the
holy
sacrament
to
the
dogs
they
soon
became
strong
throughout
the
whole
north
of
africa
and
in
one
part
of
it
numidia
they
were
stronger
than
the
catholics
after
the
death
of
julian
laws
were
made
against
them
from
time
to
time
but
do
not
seem
to
have
been
carried
out
and
although
the
donatists
quarrelled
much
among
themselves
and
split
up
into
a
number
of
parties
they
were
still
very
powerful
in
day
in
his
own
city
of
hippo
he
found
that
they
were
more
in
number
than
the
catholics
and
such
was
their
bitter
and
pharisaical
spirit
that
the
bishop
of
the
sect
at
hippo
would
not
let
any
of
his
people
so
much
as
bake
for
their
catholic
neighbours
page
augustine
did
all
that
he
could
to
make
something
of
the
donatists
but
it
was
mostly
in
vain
he
could
not
get
their
bishops
or
clergy
to
argue
with
him
they
pretended
to
call
themselves
the
children
of
the
martyrs
on
account
of
the
troubles
which
their
forefathers
had
gone
through
in
the
reign
of
constans
and
they
said
that
the
children
of
the
martyrs
could
not
stoop
to
argue
with
sinners
and
traditors
although
they
professed
that
their
sect
was
made
up
of
perfect
saints
they
took
in
all
sorts
of
worthless
converts
for
the
sake
of
swelling
their
numbers
whereas
augustine
would
not
let
any
donatists
join
the
church
without
inquiring
into
their
characters
and
if
he
found
that
they
had
done
anything
for
which
they
had
been
condemned
by
their
sect
to
do
penance
he
insisted
that
they
should
go
through
a
penance
before
being
admitted
into
the
church
but
notwithstanding
the
difficulties
which
he
found
in
dealing
with
them
he
and
others
succeeded
in
drawing
over
a
great
number
of
donatists
to
the
church
and
this
made
the
circumcellions
so
furious
that
they
fell
on
the
catholic
clergy
whenever
they
could
find
them
and
tried
to
do
them
all
possible
mischief
they
beat
and
mangled
some
of
them
cruelly
they
put
out
the
eyes
of
some
by
throwing
a
mixture
of
lime
and
vinegar
into
their
faces
and
among
other
things
they
laid
a
plan
for
waylaying
augustine
himself
which
however
he
escaped
through
the
providence
of
god
many
reports
of
these
savage
doings
were
carried
to
the
emperor
honorius
and
some
of
the
sufferers
appeared
at
his
court
to
tell
their
own
tale
whereupon
the
old
laws
against
the
sect
were
revived
and
severe
new
laws
were
also
made
in
these
even
death
was
threatened
against
donatists
who
should
molest
the
catholics
but
augustine
begged
that
this
penalty
might
be
withdrawn
because
the
catholic
clergy
who
knew
more
about
the
sect
than
any
one
else
would
not
give
information
against
it
if
the
punishment
of
the
donatists
were
to
be
so
great
and
he
and
his
brethren
requested
that
the
emperor
would
appoint
a
meeting
to
be
held
between
the
parties
in
order
that
they
might
talk
over
their
differences
and
if
possible
might
come
to
some
agreement
the
emperor
consented
to
do
so
and
a
meeting
took
place
accordingly
at
carthage
in
in
the
presence
of
a
commissioner
named
marcellinus
two
hundred
and
catholic
bishops
found
their
way
to
the
city
by
degrees
but
the
donatists
who
were
two
hundred
and
in
number
entered
it
in
a
body
thinking
to
make
all
the
effect
that
they
could
by
the
show
of
a
great
procession
at
the
conference
or
meeting
which
lasted
three
days
the
donatists
behaved
with
their
usual
pride
and
insolence
when
marcellinus
begged
them
to
sit
down
they
refused
because
our
lord
had
stood
before
pilate
on
being
again
asked
to
seat
themselves
they
quoted
a
text
from
the
psalms
i
will
not
sit
with
the
wicked
xxvi
meaning
that
the
catholics
were
the
wicked
and
that
they
themselves
were
too
good
to
sit
in
such
company
and
when
augustine
called
them
brethren
they
cried
out
in
anger
that
they
did
not
own
any
such
brotherhood
they
tried
to
throw
difficulties
in
the
way
of
arguing
the
question
fairly
but
on
the
third
day
their
shifts
would
serve
them
no
longer
augustine
then
took
the
lead
among
the
catholics
and
showed
at
great
length
both
how
wrongly
the
donatists
had
behaved
in
the
beginning
of
their
separation
from
the
church
and
how
contrary
to
scripture
their
principles
were
marcellinus
who
had
been
sent
by
the
emperor
to
hear
both
parties
gave
judgment
in
favour
of
the
catholics
such
of
the
donatist
bishops
and
clergy
as
would
join
the
church
were
allowed
to
keep
possession
of
their
places
but
the
others
were
to
be
banished
augustine
had
at
first
been
against
the
idea
of
trying
to
force
people
in
matters
of
religion
but
he
saw
that
many
were
brought
by
these
laws
to
join
the
church
and
after
a
time
he
came
to
think
that
such
laws
were
good
and
useful
nay
he
even
tried
to
find
a
scripture
warrant
for
them
in
the
text
compel
them
to
come
in
xiv
and
thus
unhappily
this
great
and
good
man
was
led
to
lend
his
name
to
the
grievous
error
of
thinking
that
force
or
even
persecution
may
be
used
rightly
and
with
good
effect
in
matters
of
religion
it
was
one
of
the
mistakes
to
which
people
are
liable
when
they
form
their
opinions
without
having
the
opportunity
of
seeing
how
things
work
in
the
long
run
and
on
a
large
scale
we
must
regret
that
augustine
seemed
in
any
way
to
countenance
such
means
but
even
although
he
erred
in
some
measure
as
to
this
we
may
be
sure
that
he
would
have
abhorred
the
cruelties
which
have
since
been
done
under
pretence
of
maintaining
the
true
religion
and
of
bringing
people
to
embrace
it
while
some
of
the
donatists
were
thus
brought
over
to
the
church
others
became
more
outrageous
than
ever
many
of
them
grew
desperate
and
made
away
with
themselves
one
of
their
bishops
threatened
that
if
he
were
required
by
force
to
join
the
catholics
he
would
shut
himself
up
in
a
church
with
his
people
and
that
they
would
then
set
the
building
on
fire
and
perish
in
the
flames
there
were
many
among
the
donatists
who
would
have
been
mad
enough
to
do
a
thing
of
this
kind
but
it
would
seem
that
the
bishop
was
not
put
to
the
trial
which
he
expected
the
donatists
dwindled
away
from
this
time
and
were
little
heard
of
after
augustine
days
although
there
were
still
some
in
africa
two
hundred
years
later
as
we
learn
from
the
letters
of
gregory
the
great
part
vi
of
all
the
disputes
in
which
augustine
was
engaged
that
with
the
pelagians
was
the
most
famous
the
leader
of
these
people
pelagius
was
a
briton
his
name
would
mean
either
in
latin
or
in
greek
a
of
the
and
it
is
said
that
his
british
name
was
morgan
meaning
the
same
as
the
greek
or
latin
name
pelagius
was
the
first
native
of
our
own
island
who
gained
fame
as
a
writer
or
as
a
divine
but
his
fame
was
not
of
a
desirable
kind
as
it
arose
from
the
errors
which
he
ran
into
he
was
a
man
of
learning
and
of
strict
life
and
at
rome
where
he
spent
many
years
he
was
much
respected
until
in
his
old
age
he
began
to
set
forth
opinions
which
brought
him
into
the
repute
of
a
heretic
at
rome
he
became
acquainted
with
a
man
named
celestius
who
is
said
by
some
to
have
been
an
italian
while
others
suppose
him
an
irishman
it
is
not
known
whether
celestius
learnt
his
opinions
from
pelagius
or
whether
each
of
them
had
come
to
think
in
the
same
way
before
they
knew
one
another
but
however
this
may
be
they
became
great
friends
and
joined
in
teaching
the
same
errors
augustine
as
we
have
seen
had
passed
through
such
trials
of
the
spirit
that
he
thoroughly
felt
the
need
of
god
gracious
help
in
order
to
do
or
even
to
will
any
good
thing
pelagius
on
the
contrary
seems
to
have
always
gone
on
steadily
in
the
way
of
his
religion
now
this
was
really
a
reason
why
he
should
have
thanked
that
grace
and
mercy
of
god
which
had
spared
him
the
dangers
and
the
terrible
sufferings
which
others
have
to
bear
in
the
course
of
their
spiritual
life
but
unhappily
pelagius
overlooked
the
help
of
grace
he
owned
indeed
that
all
is
from
god
but
instead
of
understanding
that
the
power
of
doing
any
good
or
of
avoiding
any
sin
is
the
especial
gift
of
the
holy
spirit
he
fancied
that
the
power
of
living
without
sin
was
given
to
us
by
god
as
a
part
of
our
he
saw
that
some
people
made
a
wrong
use
of
the
doctrine
of
our
natural
corruption
he
saw
that
instead
of
throwing
the
blame
of
their
sins
on
their
own
neglect
of
the
grace
which
is
offered
to
us
through
christ
they
spoke
of
the
weakness
and
corruption
of
their
nature
as
if
these
were
an
excuse
for
their
sins
this
was
indeed
a
grievous
error
and
one
which
pelagius
would
have
done
well
to
warn
people
against
but
in
condemning
it
he
went
far
wrong
in
an
opposite
way
he
said
that
man
nature
is
corrupt
that
it
is
nothing
the
worse
for
the
fall
of
our
first
parents
that
man
can
be
good
by
his
own
natural
power
without
needing
any
higher
help
that
men
might
live
without
sin
and
that
many
so
lived
these
notions
of
his
are
mentioned
and
are
condemned
in
the
ninth
article
of
our
own
church
where
it
is
said
that
original
sin
standeth
not
in
the
following
of
adam
as
the
pelagians
do
vainly
talk
that
is
to
say
original
sin
is
not
merely
the
actual
imitation
of
adam
sin
but
it
is
the
fault
and
corruption
of
the
nature
of
every
man
that
naturally
is
engendered
of
the
offspring
of
adam
whereby
man
is
very
far
gone
from
original
righteousness
that
is
he
is
very
far
gone
from
that
righteousness
which
adam
had
at
the
first
and
then
it
is
said
in
the
next
article
the
condition
of
man
after
the
fall
of
adam
is
such
that
he
can
not
turn
and
prepare
himself
by
his
own
natural
strength
and
good
works
to
faith
and
calling
upon
god
wherefore
we
have
no
power
to
do
good
works
pleasing
and
acceptable
to
god
without
the
grace
of
god
by
christ
preventing
us
or
us
that
we
may
have
a
good
will
and
working
with
us
when
we
have
that
good
will
thus
at
every
step
there
is
a
need
of
grace
from
above
to
help
us
on
the
way
of
salvation
after
rome
had
been
taken
by
the
goths
in
the
year
pelagius
and
celestius
passed
over
into
africa
from
which
pelagius
after
a
short
stay
went
into
the
holy
land
celestius
tried
to
get
himself
ordained
by
the
african
church
but
objections
were
made
to
him
and
a
council
was
held
which
condemned
and
excommunicated
him
augustine
was
too
busy
with
the
donatists
to
attend
this
council
but
he
was
very
much
alarmed
by
the
errors
of
the
new
teachers
and
soon
took
the
lead
in
writing
against
them
and
in
opposing
them
by
other
means
page
pelagius
was
examined
by
some
councils
in
the
holy
land
and
contrived
to
persuade
them
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
his
doctrines
he
and
celestius
even
got
a
bishop
of
rome
zosimus
to
own
them
as
sound
in
the
faith
and
to
reprove
the
african
bishops
for
condemning
them
the
secret
of
this
was
that
pelagius
used
words
in
a
crafty
way
which
neither
the
synods
in
the
holy
land
nor
the
bishop
of
rome
suspected
when
he
was
charged
with
denying
the
need
of
grace
he
said
that
he
owned
it
to
be
necessary
but
instead
of
using
the
word
in
its
right
meaning
to
signify
the
working
of
the
holy
spirit
on
the
heart
he
used
it
as
a
name
for
other
means
by
which
god
helps
us
such
as
the
power
which
pelagius
supposed
to
be
bestowed
on
us
as
a
part
of
our
nature
the
forgiveness
of
our
sins
in
baptism
the
offer
of
salvation
the
knowledge
and
instruction
given
to
us
through
holy
scripture
or
in
other
ways
by
such
tricks
the
pelagians
imposed
on
the
bishop
of
rome
and
others
but
the
africans
with
augustine
at
their
head
stood
firm
they
steadily
maintained
that
pelagius
and
celestius
were
unsound
in
their
opinions
they
told
zosimus
that
he
had
no
right
to
meddle
with
africa
and
that
he
had
been
altogether
deceived
by
the
heretics
so
after
a
while
the
bishop
of
rome
took
quite
the
opposite
line
and
condemned
pelagius
with
his
followers
and
they
were
also
condemned
in
several
councils
of
which
the
most
famous
was
the
general
council
of
ephesus
held
in
the
year
augustine
did
great
service
in
opposing
these
dangerous
doctrines
but
in
doing
so
he
said
some
things
as
to
god
choosing
of
his
elect
and
predestinating
them
or
them
out
to
salvation
which
are
rather
startling
and
might
lead
to
serious
error
but
as
to
this
deep
and
difficult
subject
i
shall
content
myself
with
quoting
a
few
words
from
our
seventeenth
article
we
must
receive
god
promises
in
such
wise
as
they
be
generally
set
forth
to
us
in
holy
scripture
and
in
our
doings
that
will
of
god
is
to
be
followed
which
we
have
expressly
declared
to
us
in
the
word
of
god
part
vii
augustine
was
still
busied
in
the
pelagian
controversy
when
a
fearful
calamity
burst
upon
his
country
the
commander
of
the
troops
in
africa
boniface
had
been
an
intimate
friend
of
his
and
had
been
much
under
his
influence
a
rival
of
boniface
aëtius
persuaded
the
empress
placidia
who
governed
in
the
name
of
her
young
son
valentinian
the
third
to
recall
the
general
from
africa
and
at
the
same
time
he
persuaded
boniface
to
disobey
the
order
telling
him
that
his
ruin
was
intended
boniface
who
was
a
man
of
open
and
generous
mind
did
not
suspect
the
villany
of
aëtius
and
as
the
only
means
of
saving
himself
he
rebelled
against
the
emperor
and
invited
the
vandals
from
spain
to
invade
africa
these
vandals
were
a
savage
nation
which
had
overrun
part
of
spain
about
twenty
years
before
they
now
gladly
accepted
boniface
invitation
and
passed
in
great
numbers
into
africa
where
the
moors
joined
them
and
the
donatists
eagerly
seized
the
opportunity
of
avenging
themselves
on
the
catholics
by
assisting
the
invaders
the
country
was
laid
waste
and
the
catholic
clergy
were
treated
with
especial
cruelty
both
by
the
vandals
who
were
arians
and
by
the
donatists
augustine
had
urged
boniface
to
return
to
his
duty
as
a
subject
of
the
empire
boniface
who
was
disgusted
by
the
savage
doings
of
the
vandals
and
had
discovered
the
tricks
by
which
aëtius
had
tempted
him
to
revolt
begged
the
vandal
leader
genseric
to
return
to
spain
but
he
found
that
he
had
rashly
raised
a
power
which
he
could
not
manage
and
the
barbarians
laughed
at
his
entreaties
as
he
could
not
prevail
with
them
by
words
he
fought
a
battle
with
them
but
he
was
defeated
and
he
then
shut
himself
up
in
augustine
city
hippo
during
all
these
troubles
augustine
was
very
active
in
writing
letters
of
exhortation
to
his
brethren
and
in
endeavouring
to
support
them
under
their
trials
and
when
hippo
was
crowded
by
a
multitude
of
all
kinds
who
had
fled
to
its
walls
for
shelter
he
laboured
without
ceasing
among
them
in
june
the
vandals
laid
siege
to
the
place
and
soon
after
the
bishop
fell
sick
in
consequence
of
his
labours
he
felt
that
his
end
was
near
and
he
wished
during
his
short
remaining
time
to
be
free
from
interruption
in
preparing
for
death
he
therefore
would
not
allow
his
friends
to
see
him
except
at
the
hours
when
he
took
food
or
medicine
he
desired
that
the
penitential
psalms
the
seven
psalms
which
are
read
in
church
on
and
which
especially
express
sorrow
for
sin
should
be
hung
up
within
his
sight
and
he
read
them
over
and
over
shedding
floods
of
tears
as
he
read
on
the
of
august
he
was
taken
to
his
rest
and
in
the
following
year
hippo
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
vandals
who
thus
became
masters
of
the
whole
of
northern
africa

councils
of
ephesus
and
chalcedon
augustine
died
just
as
a
great
council
was
about
to
be
held
in
the
east
in
preparing
for
this
council
a
compliment
was
paid
to
him
which
was
not
paid
to
any
other
person
for
whereas
it
was
usual
to
invite
the
chief
bishop
only
of
each
province
to
such
meetings
and
to
leave
him
to
choose
which
of
his
brethren
should
accompany
him
a
special
invitation
was
sent
to
augustine
although
he
was
not
even
a
metropolitan
but
only
bishop
of
a
small
town
this
shows
what
fame
he
had
gained
and
in
what
respect
his
name
was
held
even
in
the
eastern
church
see
page
the
object
of
calling
the
council
was
to
inquire
into
the
opinions
of
nestorius
bishop
of
constantinople
it
would
have
been
well
for
it
if
it
had
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
the
great
and
good
augustine
presence
for
its
proceedings
were
carried
on
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
not
pleasant
to
read
of
them
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
faults
of
those
who
were
active
in
the
council
it
laid
down
clearly
the
truth
which
nestorius
was
charged
with
denying
that
as
is
said
in
the
athanasian
creed
our
blessed
lord
although
he
be
god
and
man
yet
is
he
not
two
but
one
christ
and
this
council
which
was
held
at
ephesus
in
the
year
is
reckoned
as
the
third
general
council
some
years
after
it
a
disturbance
arose
about
a
monk
of
constantinople
named
eutyches
who
had
been
very
zealous
against
nestorius
and
now
ran
into
errors
of
an
opposite
kind
another
council
was
held
at
ephesus
in
but
dioscorus
bishop
of
alexandria
and
a
number
of
disorderly
monks
who
were
favourable
to
eutyches
behaved
in
such
a
furious
manner
at
this
assembly
that
instead
of
being
considered
as
a
general
council
it
is
known
by
a
name
which
means
a
of
but
two
years
later
when
a
new
emperor
had
succeeded
to
the
government
of
the
east
another
general
council
was
held
at
chalcedon
and
there
the
doctrines
of
eutyches
were
condemned
and
dioscorus
was
deprived
of
his
bishopric
this
council
which
was
the
fourth
of
the
general
councils
was
attended
by
six
hundred
and
thirty
bishops
it
laid
down
the
doctrine
that
our
lord
is
one
not
by
conversion
or
of
the
godhead
into
flesh
but
by
taking
of
the
manhood
into
god
one
altogether
not
by
confusion
of
substance
but
by
unity
of
person
for
as
the
reasonable
soul
and
flesh
is
one
man
so
god
and
man
is
one
christ
according
then
to
these
two
councils
which
were
held
against
nestorius
and
eutyches
we
are
to
believe
that
our
blessed
lord
is
really
god
and
really
man
the
godhead
and
the
manhood
are
not
together
in
him
so
as
to
make
something
which
would
be
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
which
is
what
the
creed
means
by
confusion
of
substance
but
they
are
in
him
distinct
from
each
other
just
as
the
soul
and
the
body
are
distinct
in
man
and
yet
they
are
not
two
but
are
joined
together
in
one
person
just
as
the
soul
and
the
body
are
joined
in
one
man
all
this
may
perhaps
be
rather
hard
for
young
readers
to
understand
but
the
third
and
fourth
general
councils
are
too
important
to
be
passed
over
even
in
a
little
book
like
this
and
even
if
what
has
been
said
here
should
not
be
quite
understood
it
will
at
least
show
that
all
those
distinctions
in
the
athanasian
creed
mean
and
that
they
were
not
set
forth
without
some
reason
but
in
order
to
meet
errors
which
had
actually
been
taught
i
may
mention
here
two
other
things
which
were
settled
by
the
council
of
chalcedon
that
it
gave
the
bishops
of
constantinople
authority
over
thrace
asia
and
pontus
and
that
it
raised
jerusalem
which
until
then
had
been
only
an
ordinary
bishopric
to
have
authority
of
the
same
kind
over
the
holy
land
these
chief
bishops
are
now
called
and
there
were
thus
five
patriarchs
namely
the
bishops
of
rome
constantinople
alexandria
antioch
and
jerusalem
the
map
will
show
you
how
these
patriarchates
were
divided
but
there
were
still
some
christian
countries
which
did
not
belong
to
any
of
them
read
here
the
explanation
of
the
map
at
the
end
of
the
volume
having
thus
mentioned
the
title
of
patriarchs
i
may
explain
here
the
use
of
another
title
which
we
hear
much
oftener
i
mean
the
title
of
the
proper
meaning
of
it
is
in
short
it
is
nothing
else
than
the
word
which
children
among
ourselves
use
in
speaking
to
their
fathers
this
title
of
pope
or
father
then
was
at
first
given
to
all
bishops
but
by
degrees
it
came
to
be
confined
in
its
use
so
that
in
the
east
only
the
bishops
of
rome
and
alexandria
were
called
by
it
while
in
the
west
it
was
given
to
the
bishop
or
patriarch
of
rome
alone

relief
of

he
had
posted
a
man
on
a
tower
with
orders
to
look
out
in
the
direction
from
which
succour
might
be
hoped
for
the
watchman
twice
returned
to
the
bishop
without
any
tidings
of
comfort
but
the
third
time
he
said
that
he
had
noticed
a
little
cloud
of
dust
as
far
off
as
he
could
see
it
is
the
aid
of
god
said
the
bishop
and
the
people
who
heard
him
took
up
the
words
and
shouted
it
is
the
aid
of
god
the
little
cloud

being
like

larger
and
drew
nearer
the
dust
was
cleared
away
by
the
wind
and
the
glitter
of
spears
and
armour
was
seen
and
just
as
the
huns
had
broken
through
the
wall
and
were
rushing
into
the
city
greedy
of
plunder
and
bloodshed
an
army
of
romans
and
allies
arrived
and
forced
them
to
retreat
after
having
been
thus
driven
from
orleans
attila
was
defeated
in
a
great
battle
near
châlons
on
the
river
marne
and
withdrew
into
germany
page
in
the
following
year
attila
invaded
italy
where
he
caused
great
consternation
but
when
the
bishop
of
rome
leo
the
great
went
to
his
camp
near
mantua
and
entreated
him
to
spare
the
country
attila
was
so
much
struck
by
the
bishop
venerable
appearance
and
his
powerful
words
that
he
agreed
to
withdraw
on
receiving
a
large
sum
of
money
a
few
months
later
he
suddenly
died
and
his
kingdom
soon
fell
to
pieces
by
degrees
the
romans
lost
britain

and
africa
and
italy
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
western
empire
genseric
who
as
has
been
mentioned
had
led
the
vandals
into
africa
long
kept
the
mediterranean
in
constant
dread
of
his
fleets
three
years
after
the
invasion
of
italy
by
attila
he
appeared
at
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
having
been
invited
by
the
empress
eudoxia
who
wished
to
be
revenged
on
her
husband
in
consequence
of
his
having
told
her
that
he
had
been
the
cause
of
her
former
death
as
the
vandals
approached
the
walls
of
rome
the
bishop
leo
went
forth
at
the
head
of
his
clergy
he
pleaded
with
genseric
as
he
had
before
pleaded
with
attila
and
he
brought
him
to
promise
that
the
city
should
not
be
burnt
and
that
the
lives
of
the
inhabitants
should
be
spared
but
genseric
gave
up
the
place
for
fourteen
days
to
plunder
and
the
sufferings
of
the
people
were
frightful
the
vandal
king
returned
to
africa
with
a
vast
quantity
of
booty
and
with
a
great
number
of
captives
among
whom
were
the
unfortunate
empress
and
her
two
daughters
on
this
occasion
the
bishop
of
carthage
deogratias
behaved
with
noble
charity
he
sold
the
gold
and
silver
plate
of
the
church
and
with
the
price
he
redeemed
some
of
the
captives
and
relieved
the
sufferings
of
others
two
of
the
churches
were
turned
into
hospitals
the
sick
were
comfortably
lodged
and
were
plentifully
supplied
with
food
and
medicines
and
the
good
bishop
old
and
infirm
as
he
was
visited
them
often
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
and
spoke
words
of
kindness
and
of
christian
consolation
to
them
page
this
behaviour
of
deogratias
was
the
more
to
his
honour
because
his
own
flock
was
suffering
severely
from
the
oppression
of
the
vandals
who
as
we
have
already
seen
were
arians
genseric
treated
the
catholics
of
africa
very
tyrannically
his
son
and
successor
hunneric
was
still
more
cruel
to
them
and
as
long
as
the
vandals
held
possession
of
africa
the
persecution
in
one
shape
or
another
was
carried
on
almost
without
ceasing

of

christianity
in
britain
as
the
old
empire
of
rome
disappears
the
modern
kingdoms
of
europe
begin
to
come
to
view
and
we
may
now
look
at
the
progress
of
the
gospel
among
the
nations
of
the
west
the
barbarians
who
got
possession
of
france
spain
south
germany
and
other
parts
of
the
empire
were
soon
converted
to
a
sort
of
christianity
but
unfortunately
it
was
not
the
true
catholic
faith
i
have
told
you
that
ulfilas
the
moses
of
the
goths
led
his
people
into
the
errors
of
arianism
as
it
was
from
the
goths
that
the
missionaries
generally
went
forth
to
convert
the
other
northern
nations
these
nations
too
for
the
most
part
became
arians
while
some
of
them
after
having
been
converted
by
catholics
afterwards
fell
into
arianism
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
opposite
the
course
of
conversion
was
among
these
nations
to
what
it
had
been
in
earlier
times
in
the
roman
empire
the
gospel
worked
its
way
up
from
the
poor
and
simple
people
who
were
the
first
to
believe
it
until
the
emperor
himself
became
at
length
a
convert
but
among
the
nations
which
now
overran
the
western
empire
the
missionaries
usually
began
by
making
a
convert
of
the
prince
when
the
prince
was
converted
his
subjects
followed
him
to
the
font
and
if
he
changed
from
catholicism
to
arianism
or
from
arianism
to
catholicism
the
people
did
the
same
in
the
course
of
time
all
the
nations
which
had
professed
arianism
were
brought
over
to
the
true
faith
the
last
who
held
out
were
the
goths
in
spain
who
gave
up
their
errors
at
a
great
council
which
was
held
at
toledo
in
and
the
lombards
in
the
north
of
italy
who
were
converted
in
the
early
part
of
the
following
century
page
our
own
island
was
little
troubled
by
arianism
and
athanasius
bears
witness
to
the
firmness
of
the
british
bishops
in
the
right
faith
but
pelagius
as
we
have
seen
was
himself
a
briton
and
although
he
did
not
himself
try
to
spread
his
errors
here
one
of
his
followers
named
agricola
brought
them
into
britain
and
did
a
great
deal
of
mischief
the
britons
had
been
long
under
the
power
of
the
romans
but
as
the
empire
grew
weaker
the
romans
found
that
they
could
not
afford
to
keep
up
an
army
here
and
they
had
given
up
britain
in
the
year
but
after
this
when
the
picts
and
scots
of
the
north
invaded
the
southern
part
of
the
island
or
what
we
now
call
england
the
britons
in
their
alarm
used
to
beg
the
assistance
of
the
romans
against
them
and
it
would
seem
as
if
the
british
clergy
had
come
to
depend
on
the
help
of
others
in
much
the
same
way
for
when
they
found
what
havoc
the
pelagian
agricola
was
making
among
their
people
they
sent
over
into
gaul
and
begged
that
the
bishops
of
that
country
would
send
them
aid
against
him
page
two
bishops
german
of
auxerre
and
lupus
of
troyes
were
sent
accordingly
by
a
council
to
which
the
petition
of
the
britons
had
been
made
these
two
could
speak
a
language
which
was
near
enough
to
the
british
to
be
understood
by
the
britons
it
was
something
like
the
welsh
or
the
irish
or
like
the
gaelic
which
is
spoken
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
for
all
these
languages
are
much
alike
their
preaching
had
a
great
effect
on
the
people
and
their
holy
lives
preached
still
better
than
their
sermons
they
disputed
with
the
pelagian
teachers
at
verulam
the
town
where
alban
was
martyred
and
which
now
takes
its
name
from
him
and
they
succeeded
for
the
time
in
putting
down
the
heresy
page
it
is
said
that
while
german
and
lupus
were
in
this
country
the
picts
and
saxons
joined
in
invading
it
and
that
the
britons
finding
their
army
unfit
to
fight
the
enemy
sent
to
beg
the
assistance
of
the
two
gaulish
bishops
so
german
and
lupus
went
to
the
british
army
and
joined
it
just
before
easter
a
great
number
of
the
soldiers
were
baptized
at
easter
and
german
put
himself
at
their
head
the
enemy
came
on
expecting
an
easy
victory
but
the
bishops
thrice
shouted
and
all
the
army
took
up
the
shout
which
was
echoed
from
the
mountains
again
and
again
so
that
the
pagans
were
struck
with
terror
and
expected
the
mountains
to
fall
on
them
they
threw
down
their
arms
and
ran
away
leaving
a
great
quantity
of
spoil
behind
them
and
many
of
them
rushed
into
a
river
where
they
were
drowned
the
place
where
this
victory
is
said
to
have
been
gained
is
still
pointed
out
in
flintshire
and
is
known
by
a
welsh
name
which
means
german
field
pelagianism
began
to
revive
in
britain
some
years
later
but
german
came
over
a
second
time
and
once
more
put
it
down
but
soon
after
this
the
saxons
came
into
britain
it
is
supposed
that
hengist
and
horsa
landed
in
kent
in
the
year
and
other
chiefs
followed
with
their
fierce
heathen
warriors
there
was
a
struggle
between
these
and
the
britons
which
lasted
a
hundred
years
until
at
length
the
invaders
got
the
better
and
the
land
was
once
more
overspread
by
heathenism
except
where
the
britons
kept
up
their
christianity
in
the
mountainous
districts
of
the
west
cumberland
wales
and
cornwall
you
shall
hear
how
the
gospel
was
introduced
among
the
saxons
chapter
xxv
scotland
and
ireland
the
only
thing
which
seems
to
be
settled
as
to
the
religious
history
of
scotland
in
these
times
is
that
a
bishop
named
ninian
preached
among
the
southern
picts
between
the
years
and
and
established
a
see
at
whithorn
in
galloway
but
in
the
year
of
ninian
death
a
far
more
famous
missionary
patrick
who
is
called
the
apostle
of
ireland
began
his
labours
in
that
island
it
is
a
question
whether
patrick
was
born
in
scotland
at
a
place
called
kirkpatrick
near
the
river
clyde
or
in
france
near
boulogne
but
wherever
it
may
have
been
his
birth
took
place
about
the
year
his
father
was
a
deacon
of
the
church
his
grandfather
was
a
presbyter
and
thus
patrick
had
the
opportunities
of
a
religious
training
from
his
infancy
he
did
not
however
use
these
opportunities
so
well
as
he
might
have
done
but
it
pleased
god
to
bring
him
to
a
better
mind
by
the
way
of
affliction
when
patrick
was
about
sixteen
years
old
he
was
carried
off
by
some
pirates
or
and
was
sold
to
a
heathen
prince
in
ireland
where
he
was
set
to
keep
cattle
and
had
to
bear
great
hardships
but
there
says
he
it
was
that
the
lord
brought
me
to
a
sense
of
the
unbelief
of
my
heart
that
i
might
call
my
sins
to
remembrance
and
turn
with
all
my
heart
to
the
lord
who
regarded
my
low
estate
and
taking
pity
on
my
youth
and
ignorance
watched
over
me
before
i
knew
him
or
had
sense
to
discern
between
good
and
evil
and
counselled
me
and
comforted
me
as
a
father
doth
a
son
i
was
employed
every
day
in
feeding
cattle
and
often
in
the
day
i
used
to
betake
myself
to
prayer
and
the
love
of
god
thus
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
his
faith
and
fear
increased
in
me
so
that
in
a
single
day
i
could
utter
as
many
as
a
hundred
prayers
and
in
the
night
almost
as
many
and
i
used
to
remain
in
the
woods
and
on
the
mountains
and
would
rise
for
prayer
before
daylight
in
the
midst
of
snow
and
ice
and
rain
and
i
felt
no
harm
from
it
nor
was
i
ever
unwilling
because
my
heart
was
hot
within
me
i
was
not
from
my
childhood
a
believer
in
the
only
god
but
continued
in
death
and
in
unbelief
until
i
was
severely
chastened
and
in
truth
i
have
been
humbled
by
hunger
and
nakedness
and
it
was
my
lot
to
go
about
in
ireland
every
day
sore
against
my
will
until
i
was
almost
worn
out
but
this
proved
rather
a
blessing
to
me
because
by
means
of
it
i
have
been
corrected
of
the
lord
and
he
has
fitted
me
for
being
what
it
once
seemed
unlikely
that
i
should
be
so
that
i
should
concern
myself
about
the
salvation
of
others
whereas
i
used
to
have
no
such
thoughts
even
for
myself
see
king
history
of
the
church
in
ireland
i
after
six
years
of
captivity
patrick
was
restored
to
his
own
country
it
is
said
that
he
then
travelled
a
great
deal
and
he
became
a
presbyter
of
the
church
he
was
carried
off
captive
a
second
time
but
this
captivity
did
not
last
long
and
he
afterwards
lived
with
his
parents
who
begged
him
never
to
leave
them
again
but
he
thought
that
in
a
vision
or
dream
he
saw
a
man
inviting
him
to
ireland
as
paul
saw
in
the
night
a
man
of
macedonia
saying
to
him
come
over
into
macedonia
and
help
us
xvi
and
patrick
was
resolved
to
preach
the
gospel
in
the
land
where
he
had
been
a
captive
in
his
youth
his
friends
got
about
him
and
entreated
him
not
to
cast
himself
among
the
savage
and
heathen
irish
one
of
them
who
was
most
familiar
with
him
when
there
seemed
no
hope
of
shaking
his
purpose
went
so
far
as
to
tell
of
some
sin
which
patrick
had
committed
in
his
boyhood
thirty
years
before
it
was
hoped
that
when
this
sin
of
his
early
days
was
known
whatever
it
may
have
been
it
would
prevent
his
being
consecrated
as
a
bishop
but
patrick
broke
through
all
difficulties
and
was
consecrated
bishop
of
the
irish
in
the
year
there
had
already
been
some
christians
in
that
country
and
a
missionary
named
palladius
had
lately
attempted
to
labour
there
but
had
allowed
himself
to
be
soon
discouraged
and
had
withdrawn
but
patrick
had
more
zeal
and
patience
than
palladius
and
gave
up
all
the
remainder
of
his
life
to
the
irish
so
that
he
would
not
even
allow
himself
the
pleasure
of
paying
a
visit
to
his
native
country
he
was
often
in
great
danger
both
from
the
priests
of
the
old
irish
heathenism
and
from
the
barbarous
princes
who
were
under
their
influences
but
he
carried
on
his
work
faithfully
and
had
the
comfort
of
seeing
it
crowned
with
abundant
success
his
death
took
place
on
the
of
march
the
greater
number
of
the
irish
are
now
romanists
and
fancy
that
patrick
was
so
too
and
that
he
was
sent
by
the
pope
to
ireland
but
he
has
left
writings
which
clearly
prove
that
this
is
quite
untrue
and
moreover
although
the
bishops
of
rome
had
been
advancing
in
power
and
although
corruptions
were
growing
on
the
church
in
his
time
yet
neither
the
claims
of
these
bishops
nor
the
other
corruptions
of
the
roman
church
had
then
reached
anything
like
their
present
height
let
us
hope
and
pray
that
god
may
be
pleased
to
deliver
our
irish
brethren
of
the
romish
communion
from
the
bondage
of
ignorance
and
error
in
which
they
are
now
unhappily
held
the
church
continued
to
flourish
in
ireland
after
patrick
death
and
learning
found
a
home
there
while
wars
and
conquests
banished
it
from
most
other
countries
of
the
west
in
the
year
the
irish
church
sent
forth
a
famous
missionary
named
columba
who
with
twelve
companions
went
into
scotland
he
preached
among
the
northern
picts
and
founded
a
monastery
in
one
of
the
western
islands
which
from
him
got
the
name
of
icolumbkill
that
is
to
say
the
of
columba
of
the
from
that
little
island
the
light
of
the
gospel
afterwards
spread
not
only
over
scotland
but
far
towards
the
south
of
england
and
many
monasteries
both
in
scotland
and
in
ireland
were
under
the
rule
of
its
abbot
for
hundreds
of
years
the
schools
of
ireland
continued
to
be
in
great
repute
young
men
flocked
to
them
from
england
and
even
from
foreign
lands
and
many
irish
missionaries
laboured
in
various
countries

clovis
the
most
famous
and
the
most
important
of
all
the
conversions
which
took
place
about
this
time
was
that
of
clovis
king
of
the
franks
from
being
the
chief
of
a
small
though
brave
people
on
the
borders
of
france
and
belgium
he
grew
by
degrees
to
be
the
founder
of
the
great
french
monarchy
his
queen
clotilda
was
a
christian
and
long
tried
in
vain
to
bring
him
over
to
her
faith
the
gods
whom
you
worship
she
said
are
nothing
and
can
profit
neither
themselves
nor
others
for
they
are
graven
out
of
stone
or
wood
or
metal
and
the
names
which
you
give
them
were
not
the
names
of
gods
but
of
men
but
he
ought
rather
to
be
worshipped
who
by
his
word
made
out
of
nothing
the
heavens
and
the
earth
the
sea
and
all
that
in
them
is
clovis
does
not
seem
to
have
cared
very
much
about
the
truth
one
way
or
the
other
but
he
had
the
fancy
which
was
common
among
the
heathens
and
which
is
often
mentioned
in
the
old
testament
that
if
people
did
not
prosper
in
this
world
the
god
whom
they
served
could
not
have
the
power
to
protect
them
and
give
them
success
and
as
he
lived
in
the
time
when
the
roman
empire
of
the
west
came
to
an
end
the
fall
of
the
empire
which
had
now
been
christian
for
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
seemed
to
him
to
prove
that
the
christian
religion
could
not
be
true
clotilda
persuaded
her
husband
to
let
their
eldest
son
be
baptized
but
the
child
died
within
a
few
days
after
and
clovis
said
that
his
baptism
was
the
cause
of
his
death
when
another
prince
was
born
however
he
allowed
him
too
to
be
baptized
clotilda
continued
to
press
her
husband
with
all
the
reason
that
she
could
think
of
in
order
to
bring
him
over
to
the
gospel
some
of
her
reasons
were
true
and
good
some
of
them
were
drawn
from
the
superstitious
opinions
of
these
times
such
as
stories
about
miracles
wrought
at
the
tomb
of
martin
at
tours
perhaps
the
bad
reasons
were
more
likely
than
the
good
ones
to
have
an
effect
on
a
rough
barbarian
prince
such
as
clovis
but
clotilda
could
make
nothing
of
him
in
any
way
at
length
in
the
year
he
was
engaged
in
battle
with
a
german
tribe
at
a
place
called
tolbiac
near
cologne
and
found
himself
in
great
danger
of
being
defeated
he
called
on
his
own
gods
but
without
success
and
at
last
he
bethought
himself
of
the
god
to
whose
worship
clotilda
had
so
long
been
trying
to
convert
him
so
in
his
anxiety
he
stretched
out
his
arms
towards
the
sky
and
called
on
the
name
of
christ
promising
that
if
the
god
of
clotilda
would
help
him
in
his
strait
he
would
become
a
christian
a
victory
followed
which
clovis
ascribed
to
the
effect
of
his
prayer
he
then
put
himself
under
the
instruction
of
remigius
bishop
of
rheims
that
he
might
get
a
knowledge
of
christian
doctrine
and
at
the
following
christmas
he
was
baptized
in
rheims
cathedral
where
the
kings
of
france
were
afterwards
crowned
for
centuries
down
to
the
unfortunate
charles
in
remigius
caused
it
to
be
decked
for
the
occasion
with
beautiful
carpets
and
hangings
a
vast
number
of
tapers
shed
their
bright
light
over
the
building
while
all
without
was
covered
by
the
darkness
of
a
december
evening
and
we
are
told
that
the
sweet
perfume
of
incense
seemed
to
those
who
were
there
like
the
air
of
paradise
as
clovis
entered
the
church
and
heard
the
solemn
chant
of
psalms
he
was
overcome
with
awe
turning
to
remigius
who
led
him
by
the
hand
he
asked
is
this
the
kingdom
of
heaven
which
you
have
promised
me
no
answered
the
bishop
but
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
way
to
it
when
they
had
reached
the
font
remigius
addressed
the
king
by
a
name
on
which
the
noblest
among
the
franks
prided
themselves
sicambrian
gently
bow
thy
neck
worship
that
which
thou
hast
burnt
and
burn
that
which
thou
hast
worshipped
three
thousand
of
the
frankish
warriors
were
forthwith
baptized
in
imitation
of
their
leader
remigius
had
much
influence
over
clovis
as
to
religious
things
and
instructed
him
as
he
found
opportunity
one
day
as
he
was
reading
to
the
king
the
story
of
our
lord
sufferings
clovis
was
so
much
moved
by
it
that
he
started
up
in
anger
and
cried
out
if
i
had
been
there
with
my
franks
i
would
have
avenged
his
wrongs
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
be
understood
that
the
religion
of
clovis
was
not
of
an
enlightened
kind
and
there
was
much
in
his
character
and
actions
which
did
not
become
his
christian
profession
yet
his
conversion
such
as
it
was
appears
to
have
been
sincere
as
his
conquests
spread
he
put
down
arianism
wherever
he
found
it
and
planted
the
catholic
faith
instead
of
it
and
from
the
circumstance
that
clovis
was
converted
to
catholic
christianity
at
a
time
when
all
the
other
princes
of
the
west
were
arians
and
when
the
emperor
of
the
east
favoured
the
heresy
of
eutyches
the
kings
of
france
got
the
title
of
eldest
son
of
the

justinian
it
would
be
wearisome
to
follow
very
particularly
the
history
of
the
church
in
the
east
for
the
next
century
and
a
half
after
the
council
of
chalcedon
the
most
important
reign
during
this
time
was
that
of
the
emperor
justinian
which
lasted
years
from
to
under
him
the
vandals
were
conquered
in
africa
and
the
goths
in
italy
both
these
countries
became
once
more
parts
of
the
empire
and
arianism
was
put
down
in
both
justinian
also
in
the
year
put
an
end
to
the
old
heathen
philosophy
by
ordering
that
the
schools
of
athens
in
which
st
basil
gregory
of
nazianzum
and
the
emperor
julian
had
studied
together
two
hundred
years
before
should
be
shut
up
the
philosophers
who
had
continued
to
teach
their
heathen
notions
there
although
they
had
been
obliged
to
treat
the
religion
of
the
empire
with
outward
respect
were
in
great
distress
at
finding
their
trade
taken
away
from
them
they
thought
it
unsafe
to
remain
in
justinian
dominions
and
made
their
way
into
persia
where
the
king
was
a
heathen
and
was
said
to
be
a
friend
of
learned
men
the
king
received
them
kindly
but
the
persian
heathenism
was
very
different
from
their
own
and
the
ways
of
the
country
were
altogether
strange
to
them
so
that
they
felt
themselves
very
uncomfortable
in
persia
and
became
so
as
to
be
willing
to
risk
even
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
getting
back
to
their
own
country
happily
for
them
the
persian
king
was
able
to
intercede
for
them
in
making
a
peace
with
justinian
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
might
live
within
the
empire
as
they
liked
without
being
troubled
by
the
laws
if
they
would
only
remain
quiet
and
not
try
to
draw
christian
youths
away
from
the
faith
the
philosophers
were
too
glad
to
return
on
such
terms
i
wish
i
could
tell
that
they
became
christians
themselves
but
all
that
is
said
of
them
is
that
when
they
died
there
were
no
more
of
the
kind
and
that
heathen
philosophy
no
longer
stood
in
the
way
of
the
gospel
see
page
justinian
spent
vast
sums
of
money
on
buildings
especially
on
churches
but
it
is
said
that
much
of
what
he
spent
in
this
way
had
been
got
by
oppressive
taxes
and
by
other
bad
means
so
that
we
can
not
think
much
the
better
of
him
for
it
the
grandest
of
all
his
buildings
was
the
cathedral
of
constantinople
the
church
had
been
founded
by
constantine
the
great
but
was
once
burnt
down
after
the
banishment
of
chrysostom
and
a
second
time
in
this
reign
justinian
rebuilt
it
at
a
vast
expense
and
as
he
cast
his
eyes
around
it
on
the
day
of
the
consecration
after
expressing
his
thankfulness
to
god
for
having
been
allowed
to
accomplish
so
great
a
work
he
gave
vent
to
the
pride
of
his
heart
in
the
words
i
have
beaten
thee
o
solomon
the
cathedral
was
afterwards
partly
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
but
justinian
again
restored
it
and
caused
it
to
be
once
more
consecrated
about
two
years
before
his
death
we
learn
from
one
of
his
laws
that
this
church
had
sixty
priests
a
hundred
deacons
forty
deaconesses
ninety
subdeacons
a
hundred
and
ten
readers
singers
and
a
hundred
doorkeepers
and
which
we
should
perhaps
not
have
expected
to
hear
the
law
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
number
of
clergy
connected
with
the
cathedral
from
increasing
beyond
this
lest
it
should
not
have
wealth
enough
to
maintain
a
greater
number
this
great
building
is
still
standing
although
it
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
mahometan
turks
and
it
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
it
was
dedicated
to
the
eternal
wisdom
and
is
now
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
sophia
being
the
greek
word
for

nestorians
and
monophysites
from
the
time
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
to
the
end
of
justinian
reign
the
eastern
church
was
vexed
by
controversies
which
arose
out
of
the
opinions
of
eutyches
on
account
of
these
quarrels
the
churches
of
rome
and
constantinople
would
have
no
intercourse
with
each
other
for
years
the
party
which
had
at
first
been
called
eutychians
after
eutyches
afterwards
got
the
name
of
monophysites
that
is
to
say
of
one
nature
because
they
said
that
after
our
blessed
lord
had
taken
on
him
the
nature
of
man
his
godhead
and
his
manhood
made
up
but
nature
whereas
the
catholics
held
that
his
two
natures
remain
perfect
and
distinct
in
him
the
party
split
up
into
a
number
of
divisions
the
very
names
of
which
it
is
difficult
to
remember
and
other
quarrels
arose
out
of
the
great
controversy
with
the
eutychians
the
most
noted
of
these
was
the
dispute
as
to
what
were
called
the
three
articles
it
was
not
properly
a
question
respecting
the
faith
but
whether
certain
writings
then
a
hundred
years
old
were
or
were
not
favourable
to
nestorianism
but
it
was
thought
so
important
that
a
council
which
is
reckoned
as
the
fifth
general
council
was
held
on
account
of
it
at
constantinople
in
the
year
see
chap
xxii
notwithstanding
all
their
quarrels
among
themselves
the
monophysites
grew
very
strong
in
various
countries
in
egypt
they
were
more
in
number
than
the
catholics
the
abyssinian
church
which
as
we
saw
in
a
former
chapter
was
considered
as
a
daughter
of
the
egyptian
church
took
up
these
opinions
the
nubians
were
converted
from
heathenism
by
monophysite
missionaries
and
in
armenia
the
church
exchanged
the
catholic
doctrine
for
the
monophysite
in
the
sixth
century
chap
x
but
the
most
remarkable
man
of
this
sect
was
a
syrian
named
jacob
he
found
his
party
suffering
and
greatly
weakened
in
consequence
of
the
laws
which
the
emperors
had
made
against
it
and
most
of
the
bishops
and
clergy
had
been
removed
by
banishment
imprisonment
or
other
means
being
resolved
to
preserve
the
sect
if
possible
from
dying
out
jacob
went
to
constantinople
made
his
way
into
the
prison
where
some
of
the
monophysite
bishops
were
confined
and
was
secretly
consecrated
by
them
as
a
bishop
with
authority
to
watch
over
all
the
congregations
of
their
communion
throughout
syria
and
the
east
for
nearly
forty
years
he
laboured
in
carrying
out
the
work
which
he
had
undertaken
with
a
zeal
and
a
stedfastness
which
we
can
not
but
admire
although
we
must
regret
that
they
were
employed
in
the
cause
of
heresy
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
known
as
there
were
severe
laws
against
spreading
his
opinions
he
dressed
himself
as
a
beggar
and
thence
got
the
name
of
in
this
disguise
he
travelled
without
ceasing
over
syria
and
mesopotamia
his
secret
was
faithfully
kept
by
the
members
of
his
party
he
stirred
up
their
spirit
ordained
bishops
and
clergy
to
minister
among
them
in
private
and
at
his
death
in
he
left
the
sect
large
and
flourishing
from
this
jacob
the
monophysites
of
other
countries
as
well
as
of
his
own
got
the
name
of
jacobites
in
return
for
which
they
called
the
catholics
that
is
to
say
of
the
emperor
and
by
these
names
of
melchites
and
jacobites
the
remnants
of
the
old
christian
parties
in
the
east
are
known
to
this
day
these
jacobites
of
the
east
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
jacobites
of
english
history
who
were
the
friends
of
james
and
of
his
family
after
the
revolution
of
the
nestorians
also
continued
to
be
a
strong
body
both
they
and
the
monophysites
were
very
active
in
missions
more
active
indeed
than
the
eastern
catholics
the
nestorians
in
particular
made
great
numbers
of
converts
in
persia
where
the
heathen
kings
would
allow
no
other
kind
of
christianity
than
nestorianism
in
india
and
in
other
parts
of
asia
and
in
the
seventh
century
which
is
somewhat
beyond
the
bounds
of
this
little
book
their
missionaries
made
their
way
even
to
china
where
they
preached
with
great
success
chapter
xxix
benedict
part
let
us
now
look
again
at
the
monks
their
way
of
life
was
at
first
devised
as
a
means
of
either
practising
repentance
for
sin
or
rising
to
such
a
height
of
holiness
as
was
supposed
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
persons
busied
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
but
in
course
of
time
a
change
took
place
as
the
life
of
monks
grew
more
common
it
grew
less
strict
indeed
it
would
seem
that
whenever
any
way
of
life
which
professes
to
be
very
strict
becomes
common
its
strictness
will
pretty
surely
be
lessened
or
given
up
altogether
people
at
first
turned
monks
because
they
felt
that
such
means
of
holy
living
as
they
had
been
used
to
did
not
make
them
so
good
as
they
ought
to
be
and
because
they
hoped
to
do
better
in
this
new
kind
of
life
but
when
the
monkish
life
was
no
longer
new
monks
neglected
its
rules
just
as
those
before
them
had
neglected
the
rules
which
holy
scripture
and
the
church
had
laid
down
for
all
christians
in
the
unhappy
days
which
had
now
come
on
the
monasteries
of
the
west
had
in
great
measure
escaped
the
evils
of
war
and
conquest
which
laid
waste
everything
around
them
the
barbarians
who
overwhelmed
the
empire
generally
respected
them
and
now
the
life
of
monks
instead
of
being
chosen
for
its
hardships
as
it
had
been
at
first
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
easiest
and
the
safest
life
of
all
it
was
sought
after
as
one
which
would
free
people
from
the
dangers
to
which
they
would
be
liable
if
they
remained
in
the
world
and
took
the
common
share
in
the
world
risks
and
troubles
another
important
matter
was
this
that
monkery
had
taken
its
rise
in
egypt
and
in
syria
where
the
climate
and
the
habits
of
the
people
were
very
different
from
those
of
the
western
countries
and
a
great
part
of
the
monkish
rules
were
fitted
only
for
the
particular
circumstances
and
character
of
the
eastern
nations
for
instance
they
could
do
with
less
food
than
the
people
of
the
west
so
that
a
writer
of
the
fifth
century
said
a
large
appetite
is
gluttony
in
the
greeks
but
in
the
gauls
it
is
nature
again
the
egyptians
and
the
syrians
in
their
hot
climate
did
not
need
active
employment
in
the
same
way
as
the
western
nations
do
in
order
to
keep
their
minds
and
their
bodies
healthful
they
could
spend
their
hours
and
their
days
in
calmly
thinking
of
spiritual
things
or
of
nothing
at
all
in
a
way
which
the
more
active
mind
of
europeans
can
not
bear
and
again
many
rules
as
to
dress
which
are
suitable
for
one
sort
of
climate
are
quite
unfit
for
a
different
sort
now
the
earlier
rules
for
monks
had
been
drawn
up
either
in
the
east
or
after
eastern
patterns
and
although
when
they
were
brought
into
the
west
people
for
a
time
obeyed
them
as
well
as
they
could
it
was
found
that
they
would
not
obey
them
any
longer
when
the
first
heat
of
zeal
for
monkery
had
passed
away
hence
it
followed
that
throughout
the
monasteries
of
the
west
there
was
a
general
neglect
of
the
rules
by
which
they
professed
to
be
governed
and
it
was
high
time
that
there
should
be
some
reformation
a
reformer
arose
in
the
sixth
century
this
was
benedict
who
was
born
near
nursia
in
italy
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
was
sent
to
school
at
rome
under
the
care
of
a
nurse
as
seems
to
have
been
usual
in
those
days
he
worked
hard
at
his
studies
but
the
bad
behaviour
of
the
other
boys
and
young
men
at
rome
so
shocked
him
that
when
he
had
been
there
two
years
he
resolved
to
bear
it
no
longer
he
therefore
suddenly
ran
away
from
the
city
and
after
his
nurse
had
gone
a
considerable
distance
with
him
he
left
her
and
made
his
way
into
a
rough
and
lonely
country
near
subiaco
where
he
took
up
his
abode
in
a
cave
here
he
was
found
out
by
a
monk
of
a
neighbouring
house
named
romanus
who
used
daily
to
save
part
of
his
own
allowance
of
food
and
to
carry
it
to
his
young
friend
the
cave
opened
from
the
face
of
a
lofty
rock
and
the
way
that
romanus
took
of
conveying
the
food
to
benedict
was
by
letting
it
down
at
the
end
of
a
string
from
the
top
of
the
rock
benedict
had
lived
in
this
manner
for
three
years
when
he
was
discovered
by
some
shepherds
who
at
first
took
him
for
some
wild
animal
but
they
soon
found
that
he
was
something
very
different
he
taught
them
and
others
to
whom
they
made
his
abode
known
and
his
character
came
to
be
so
much
respected
in
the
neighbourhood
that
he
was
chosen
abbot
of
a
monastery
he
warned
the
monks
that
they
would
probably
not
like
him
but
they
were
resolved
to
have
him
nevertheless
their
habits
however
were
so
bad
that
benedict
felt
himself
obliged
to
check
them
rather
sharply
and
the
monks
then
attempted
to
get
rid
of
him
by
mixing
poison
in
his
drink
but
he
found
out
their
wicked
design
and
the
only
reproof
which
he
gave
them
was
by
reminding
them
how
he
had
warned
them
not
to
make
him
their
abbot
with
this
he
left
them
to
themselves
and
went
quietly
back
to
his
cave
his
name
now
grew
more
and
more
famous
great
multitudes
of
people
flocked
to
see
him
and
even
persons
of
high
rank
sent
their
sons
to
be
trained
under
him
he
built
twelve
monasteries
each
for
an
abbot
and
twelve
monks
but
there
was
a
spiteful
monk
named
florentius
who
would
not
allow
him
any
peace
so
long
as
they
were
near
each
other
so
benedict
thought
it
best
to
give
way
and
in
he
left
subiaco
with
some
companions
and
after
some
wanderings
arrived
at
mount
cassino
there
he
found
that
the
country
people
still
worshipped
some
of
the
old
heathen
gods
and
that
there
was
a
grove
which
was
held
sacred
to
these
gods
but
he
set
boldly
to
work
and
notwithstanding
all
that
could
be
done
to
oppose
him
he
cut
down
the
grove
destroyed
the
idols
and
built
a
little
chapel
from
which
in
time
grew
up
a
great
and
famous
monastery
which
still
exists
and
at
mount
cassino
he
drew
up
his
rule
in
the
year
so
that
the
beginning
of
the
monks
of
benedict
was
in
the
very
same
year
in
which
heathen
philosophy
came
to
its
end
by
the
closing
of
the
schools
of
athens
see
page
part
ii
benedict
had
seen
the
mischief
which
arose
from
too
great
strictness
of
rules
he
saw
how
it
led
to
open
disobedience
and
carelessness
in
some
and
to
hypocritical
pretence
in
others
and
therefore
he
meant
to
guard
against
these
faults
by
making
his
rule
milder
than
those
of
the
east
it
was
to
be
such
that
europeans
might
keep
it
without
danger
to
their
health
and
he
allowed
it
to
be
varied
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
different
countries
in
which
it
might
be
established
every
benedictine
monastery
was
to
be
under
an
abbot
who
was
to
be
chosen
by
the
monks
the
brethren
were
to
obey
the
abbot
in
everything
while
the
abbot
was
charged
not
to
be
haughty
or
tyrannical
in
using
his
authority
next
to
the
abbot
there
might
either
be
a
or
which
benedict
liked
better
there
might
be
a
number
of
or
who
were
to
help
and
advise
the
abbot
in
the
government
of
his
monastery
any
one
who
wished
to
join
the
order
was
to
undergo
trial
for
a
year
before
admission
those
who
were
admitted
into
it
were
required
to
give
in
a
written
vow
that
they
would
continue
in
it
that
they
would
amend
their
lives
and
that
they
would
obey
those
who
were
set
over
them
every
monk
was
obliged
to
give
up
all
his
property
to
the
order
nobody
was
allowed
to
have
anything
of
his
own
but
all
things
were
common
to
the
brethren
the
monks
might
not
receive
any
presents
or
letters
even
from
their
nearest
relations
without
the
knowledge
and
leave
and
if
a
present
were
sent
for
one
of
them
the
abbot
had
the
power
to
keep
it
from
him
and
to
give
it
to
any
other
monk
it
was
one
important
part
of
the
rule
that
the
monks
should
have
sufficient
employment
provided
for
them
they
were
to
get
up
at
two
in
the
morning
they
were
to
attend
eight
services
a
day
or
if
they
happened
to
be
at
a
distance
from
their
monastery
they
were
to
observe
the
hours
of
the
services
by
prayer
and
they
were
to
work
seven
hours
portions
of
time
were
allowed
for
learning
psalms
by
heart
and
for
reading
the
scriptures
lives
of
holy
men
and
other
edifying
books
at
meals
the
monks
were
not
to
talk
but
some
book
was
to
be
read
aloud
to
them
their
food
was
to
be
plain
and
simple
no
flesh
was
allowed
except
to
the
sick
but
all
such
matters
were
to
be
settled
by
the
abbot
according
to
the
climate
and
the
season
to
the
age
the
health
and
the
employment
of
the
monks
their
dress
was
to
be
coarse
but
was
to
be
varied
according
to
circumstances
they
were
to
sleep
by
ten
or
twenty
in
a
room
each
in
a
separate
bed
and
without
taking
off
their
clothes
a
dean
was
to
have
the
care
of
each
room
and
a
light
was
to
be
kept
burning
in
each
no
talking
was
to
be
allowed
after
the
last
service
of
the
day
the
monks
were
never
to
go
beyond
the
monastery
without
leave
and
in
order
that
there
might
be
little
occasion
for
their
going
out
it
was
to
contain
within
its
walls
the
garden
the
well
the
mill
the
bakehouse
and
other
such
necessary
things
the
abbot
was
to
set
every
monk
his
work
if
it
were
found
that
any
one
was
inclined
to
pride
himself
on
his
skill
in
any
art
or
trade
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
practise
it
but
was
obliged
to
take
up
some
other
employment
benedict
died
in
and
by
that
time
his
order
had
made
its
way
into
france
spain
and
sicily
it
soon
drew
into
itself
all
the
monks
of
the
west
and
was
divided
into
a
number
of
branches
which
all
looked
up
to
benedict
as
their
founder
and
although
it
would
be
a
sad
mistake
to
wish
for
any
revival
of
monkery
in
our
own
days
we
ought
in
justice
to
see
and
to
acknowledge
that
through
god
providence
these
monks
became
the
means
of
great
benefits
to
mankind
not
only
were
their
services
important
for
the
maintenance
of
the
gospel
where
it
was
already
planted
and
for
the
spreading
of
it
among
the
heathen
but
they
cleared
forests
brought
waste
lands
into
tillage
and
did
much
to
civilize
the
rude
nations
among
whom
they
laboured
after
a
time
learning
began
to
be
cultivated
among
them
and
during
the
troubled
ages
which
followed
it
found
a
refuge
in
the
monasteries
the
monks
taught
the
young
they
copied
the
scriptures
and
other
ancient
books
for
printing
was
as
yet
unknown
they
wrote
histories
of
their
times
and
other
books
of
their
own
to
them
indeed
it
is
that
we
are
mainly
indebted
for
preserving
the
knowledge
of
the
past
through
many
centuries
chapter
xxx

of
the
sixth
century
part
i
we
must
not
suppose
that
the
conversion
of
the
western
barbarians
was
of
any
very
perfect
kind
they
mixed
up
a
great
deal
of
their
own
barbarism
with
their
christianity
and
besides
this
they
took
up
many
of
the
vices
of
the
old
and
nations
whose
countries
they
had
conquered
and
occupied
much
heathen
superstition
lingered
among
them
it
was
even
a
common
saying
in
spain
that
if
a
man
has
to
pass
between
heathen
altars
and
god
church
it
is
no
harm
if
he
pay
his
respects
to
both
the
clergy
were
very
wealthy
and
prosperous
but
did
not
venture
to
interfere
with
the
vices
of
the
great
and
powerful
or
if
they
did
it
was
at
their
peril
for
instance
when
a
bishop
of
rouen
had
offended
the
frankish
queen
fredegund
she
caused
him
to
be
murdered
in
his
own
cathedral
at
the
most
solemn
service
of
religion
became
a
protection
to
crime
murderers
were
allowed
to
take
refuge
in
churches
and
might
not
be
dragged
out
until
after
an
oath
had
been
made
that
their
lives
should
be
safe
it
had
been
the
ancient
custom
of
the
germans
to
let
all
crimes
be
atoned
for
by
the
payment
of
money
if
for
example
a
person
had
killed
another
he
had
no
more
to
do
than
to
pay
a
certain
sum
to
the
dead
man
relations
and
this
way
of
making
up
for
misdeeds
was
now
brought
into
the
church
it
was
thought
that
men
might
make
satisfaction
for
their
sins
by
paying
money
and
that
the
effect
would
be
the
same
if
others
paid
for
them
after
their
death
we
may
understand
how
this
worked
from
another
story
of
queen
fredegund
who
seems
to
have
been
a
perfect
monster
of
wickedness
she
set
two
of
her
pages
to
murder
a
king
named
sigebert
and
by
way
of
encouraging
them
she
said
that
she
would
honour
them
highly
if
they
came
off
with
their
lives
but
that
if
they
were
slain
she
would
lay
out
a
great
deal
of
money
in
alms
for
the
good
of
their
souls
as
might
naturally
have
been
expected
among
such
people
it
came
to
be
very
commonly
thought
that
the
observance
of
outward
worship
and
ceremonies
was
all
that
religion
required
pretended
miracles
were
wrought
in
great
numbers
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
on
the
ignorant
and
all
from
the
king
downwards
were
then
ignorant
enough
to
be
deceived
by
them
the
superstitions
which
had
begun
in
the
fourth
century
continued
to
grow
on
the
church
such
as
the
reverence
paid
to
saints
and
especially
to
the
blessed
virgin
so
that
people
allowed
them
a
part
of
the
honour
which
ought
to
have
been
kept
for
god
alone
among
other
such
corruptions
were
the
reverence
for
the
of
saints
that
is
for
parts
of
their
bodies
or
for
things
which
had
belonged
to
them
and
the
religious
honour
paid
to
images
and
pictures
these
and
other
evils
increased
more
and
more
until
at
length
they
could
be
borne
no
longer
and
in
many
countries
they
caused
the
great
religious
change
which
is
called
the
see
page
but
nearly
a
thousand
years
had
to
pass
before
the
time
of
the
reformation
and
in
the
meanwhile
although
much
was
amiss
in
the
christianity
which
prevailed
it
yet
was
the
means
of
blessing
and
of
salvation
and
there
were
never
wanting
good
men
who
although
there
were
many
defects
and
errors
in
their
opinions
firmly
held
and
clearly
taught
the
necessity
of
a
real
living
faith

the
state
of
italy
towards
the
end
of

sixth
century

very
wretched

numbers
of
its
people
had
perished
in
the
course
of
the
wars
by
which
justinian
generals
had
wrested
the
country
from
the
goths
and
had
again
united
it
to
the
empire
multitudes
of
others
had
been
destroyed
by
famine
and
pestilence
the
lombards
who
had
crossed
the
alps
in
the
year
had
obliged
the
emperors
to
yield
the
north
and
part
of
the
middle
of
italy
to
them
and
they
continually
threatened
the
portions

still
remained
to

empire
no
help
against
them
was
to
be
got
from

whom
the
emperors
sent
to
manage
their
italian
dominions
instead
of
directing

the
land
was
left
uncultivated
partly
through
the
loss
of
inhabitants
and
partly
because
those
who
remained
were
disheartened
by
the
miseries
of
the
time
they
had
not
the
spirit
to
bestow
their
labour
on
it
when
there
was
almost
a
certainty
that
their
crops
would
be
destroyed
or
carried
off
by
the
lombard
invaders
and
the
soil

left
to
itself

in
many
places
become
so
unwholesome

it
was
not
fit

in
former
times
been
so
thickly
peopled
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
get
supplies
of
corn
from
sicily
and
from
africa
but
now
such
foreign
supplies
were
wanted
for
a
very
different
reason
that
the
inhabitants
of
italy
could
not
or
did
not
grow
corn
for
themselves
the
city
of
rome
had
suffered
from
storms
and
from
repeated
floods
of
the
river
tiber
which
did
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
its
buildings
and
sometimes
washed
away
or
spoiled
the
stores
of
corn
which
were
laid
up
in
the
granaries
the
people
were
kept
in
terror
by
the
lombards
who
often
advanced
to
their
very
walls
so
that
it
was
unsafe
to
venture
beyond
the
gates
the
condition
of
the
church
too
was
very
deplorable
the
troubles
of
the
times
had
produced
a
general
decay
of
morals
and
order
both
among
the
clergy
and
among

people
the
lombards
were
arians
and
religious
enmity
was
added
to
the
other
causes

dislike
between
them
and
the
romans
in
istria
there
was
a
division
which
had
begun
after

which
kept
the

recovered

to
lift
up
its
head
and
took
courage
from
the
confusions
of
the
time
to
vex
the
church
the
churches
of
the
east
were
torn
by
quarrels
as
to
eutychianism
and
nestorianism
and
the
patriarchs
of
constantinople
seemed
likely
with
the
help
of
the
emperor
favour
to
be
dangerous
rivals
to
the
popes
of
rome
page

such
was
the
state
of
things
when
gregory
the
great
became
pope
or
bishop
of
rome
in
the
year
chapter
xxxi
gregory
the
great
part
gregory
was
born
at
rome
of
a
noble
and
wealthy
family
in
the
year
in
his
youth
he
engaged
in
public
business
and
he
rose
to
be
prætor
of
rome
which
was
one
of
the
chief
offices
under
the
government
in
this
office
he
was
much
beloved
and
respected
by
the
people
but
about
the
age
of
a
great
change
took
place
in
his
life
he
resolved
to
forsake
the
pursuit
of
worldly
honours
and
spent
all
his
wealth
in
founding
seven
monasteries
he
gave
up
his
family
house
at
rome
to
begin
a
monastery
in
which
he
became
at
first
a
simple
monk
and
was
afterwards
chosen
abbot
a
pope
named
pelagius
showed
him
great
favour
by
making
him
his
secretary
and
employing
him
for
some
years
as
a
sort
of
ambassador
at
the
emperor
court
at
constantinople
and
when
pelagius
was
carried
off
by
a
plague
in
the
year
the
nobles
the
clergy
and
the
people
of
rome
all
agreed
in
choosing
gregory
to
succeed
him
gregory
was
afraid
to
undertake
the
office
it
was
necessary
that
the
emperor
should
consent
to
his
appointment
and
he
wrote
to
beg
that
the
emperor
would
refuse
his
consent
but
the
governor
of
rome
stopped
the
letter
and
all
the
other
attempts
which
gregory
made
to
escape
the
honour
intended
for
him
were
baffled
so
that
in
the
end
he
was
obliged
to
submit
and
was
consecrated
as
bishop
of
rome
in
september
gregory
felt
all
the
difficulties
of
his
new
place
he
compares
his
church
to
an
old
ship
shattered
by
winds
and
waves
decayed
in
its
timbers
full
of
leaks
and
in
continual
danger
of
going
to
wreck
the
vast
quantity
and
variety
of
business
which
he
went
through
appears
to
us
from
the
collection
of
his
letters
of
which
about
eight
hundred
and
fifty
still
remain
we
see
from
these
how
he
strove
to
strengthen
his
church
in
all
quarters
and
what
steps
he
took
for
the
government
of
it
some
of
the
letters
are
addressed
to
emperors
and
kings
and
treat
about
the
greatest
affairs
of
church
or
state
and
then
all
at
once
we
find
him
passing
from
such
high
matters
to
direct
that
some
poor
tenant
on
one
of
his
estates
should
be
excused
from
paying
a
part
of
his
rent
or
that
relief
should
be
given
to
some
widow
or
orphan
who
had
written
from
a
distance
to
ask
his
help
the
bishops
of
rome
had
by
degrees
become
very
rich
they
had
estates
not
only
in
italy
and
sicily
but
in
africa
in
france
and
even
in
asia
and
the
people
who
managed
these
estates
were
employed
by
gregory
to
carry
on
his
other
business
in
the
same
countries
and
to
report
the
state
of
the
church
to
him
from
all
quarters
very
little
of
his
large
income
was
spent
on
himself
we
may
have
some
notion
of
the
plain
way
in
which
the
great
bishop
lived
from
one
of
his
letters
to
the
steward
of
his
estates
in
sicily
you
have
sent
me
says
gregory
one
wretched
horse
and
five
good
asses
i
can
not
ride
the
horse
because
he
is
wretched
nor
the
good
beasts
because
they
are
but
asses
he
lived
chiefly
in
the
company
of
monks
and
clergy
employing
himself
in
study
with
them
and
in
the
midst
of
all
the
business
which
took
up
his
time
he
wrote
a
number
of
books
of
which
some
are
very
valuable
he
was
also
famous
as
a
preacher
among
his
sermons
are
a
set
of
on
the
prophet
ezekiel
which
he
had
meant
to
carry
further
but
he
was
obliged
to
break
off
by
the
attacks
of
the
lombards
as
he
told
his
people
in
the
end
of
the
last
sermon
let
no
one
blame
me
he
says
if
after
this
discourse
i
stop
since
as
you
all
see
our
troubles
are
multiplied
on
us
on
every
side
we
are
surrounded
with
swords
on
every
side
we
dread
the
danger
of
death
which
is
close
at
hand
some
come
back
to
us
with
their
hands
cut
off
we
hear
of
some
as
being
taken
prisoners
and
of
others
as
slain
i
am
forced
to
my
tongue
from
expounding
since
my
soul
is
weary
of
my
life
x
how
can
i
who
am
forced
daily
to
drink
bitter
things
draw
forth
sweet
things
to
you
what
remains
for
us
but
that
in
the
chastisement
which
we
are
suffering
because
of
our
misdeeds
we
should
give
thanks
with
weeping
to
him
who
made
us
and
who
hath
bestowed
on
us
the
spirit
of
adoption
viii
to
him
who
sometimes
nourisheth
his
children
with
bread
and
sometimes
correcteth
them
with
a
scourge
who
by
benefits
and
by
sufferings
alike
is
training
us
for
an
eternal
inheritance
gregory
laboured
zealously
in
improving
the
education
of
the
clergy
and
in
reforming
such
disorders
as
he
found
in
his
church
he
founded
a
school
for
singing
and
established
a
new
way
of
chanting
which
from
him
has
the
name
of
the
and
is
used
to
this
day
we
are
told
that
the
whip
with
which
he
used
to
correct
his
choristers
was
kept
at
rome
as
a
relic
for
hundreds
of
years
his
charities
were
very
great
on
the
first
day
of
every
month
he
gave
out
large
quantities
of
provisions
to
the
people
of
rome
the
old
nobility
had
suffered
so
much
by
the
wars
and
by
the
loss
of
their
estates
in
countries
which
had
been
torn
from
them
by
the
barbarians
that
many
of
them
were
glad
to
come
in
for
a
share
of
the
good
bounty
every
day
he
sent
relief
to
a
number
of
poor
persons
in
all
parts
of
the
city
and
he
used
to
send
dishes
from
his
own
table
to
those
whom
he
knew
to
be
in
distress
but
ashamed
to
ask
for
assistance
once
when
a
poor
man
was
found
dead
in
the
streets
gregory
denied
himself
the
holy
communion
for
some
days
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
be
in
some
measure
to
blame
he
used
to
receive
strangers
and
wanderers
at
his
own
table
out
of
regard
for
our
words
inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
xxv
part
ii
having
thus
seen
something
of
gregory
life
at
home
we
must
now
look
at
his
proceedings
in
other
quarters
he
had
a
sharp
dispute
with
a
bishop
of
constantinople
on
account
of
the
title
of
which
the
patriarchs
of
the
eastern
capital
had
for
some
time
taken
to
themselves
when
we
hear
such
a
title
we
may
naturally
fancy
that
it
signified
a
claim
to
authority
over
the
whole
church
on
earth
but
as
it
was
then
used
it
really
had
no
such
meaning
the
greeks
were
fond
of
lofty
and
sounding
titles
which
seemed
to
mean
much
more
than
they
were
really
understood
to
mean
this
fondness
appears
in
the
titles
of
the
emperors
and
of
the
officers
of
their
empire
and
it
was
by
it
that
the
patriarchs
were
led
to
style
themselves
universal
bishop
if
the
title
had
been
intended
as
a
claim
to
authority
over
all
churches
it
could
only
have
been
given
to
one
person
at
a
time
but
we
find
that
the
emperor
justinian
gave
it
to
the
bishops
both
of
constantinople
and
of
rome
and
that
he
styled
each
of
them
head
of
all
the
churches
and
whatever
the
patriarchs
of
constantinople
may
have
meant
by
it
they
certainly
did
not
make
any
claim
to
authority
over
rome
or
the
western
church
but
there
was
an
old
jealousy
between
the
sees
of
rome
and
constantinople
ever
since
the
time
when
the
second
general
council
in
gave
the
bishop
of
constantinople
the
second
place
of
honour
in
the
whole
church
this
jealousy
had
grown
greater
in
late
times
when
there
was
no
very
kindly
feeling
between
the
emperors
and
their
italian
subjects
and
when
it
seemed
not
impossible
that
the
bishop
of
the
new
capital
backed
by
the
emperor
might
even
try
to
dispute
the
first
place
with
the
bishop
of
rome
and
gregory
who
did
not
understand
the
greek
language
or
how
little
the
greeks
meant
by
their
fine
titles
was
ready
to
take
offence
at
the
name
of
universal
bishop
so
when
a
bishop
of
constantinople
john
the
faster
styled
himself
so
on
an
important
occasion
gregory
objected
strongly
he
wrote
to
john
to
the
emperor
and
to
the
bishops
of
alexandria
and
of
antioch
declaring
that
the
title
was
proud
and
foolish
that
it
came
from
the
devil
and
was
a
token
of
antichrist
approach
and
that
it
was
unfit
for
any
christian
bishop
to
use
the
emperor
however
would
not
help
him
against
the
patriarch
john
would
not
yield
and
the
other
eastern
patriarchs
partly
from
a
wish
to
be
at
peace
and
partly
because
the
words
did
not
seem
offensive
to
them
as
they
did
to
gregory
were
little
disposed
to
take
up
his
quarrel
after
a
time
another
emperor
who
had
special
reasons
for
wishing
to
stand
well
with
gregory
forbade
the
successor
of
john
to
call
himself
universal
but
the
title
was
soon
restored
by
the
emperors
to
the
bishops
of
constantinople
although
not
until
after
the
death
of
gregory
the
most
curious
part
of
the
story
however
is
this
that
gregory
successors
in
the
popedom
have
taken
up
the
very
title
which
he
condemned
so
strongly
and
that
instead
of
using
it
in
the
harmless
meaning
which
it
had
in
the
east
they
have
intended
it
as
a
claim
to
power
over
the
whole
church
that
claim
of
which
the
very
notion
filled
gregory
with
such
horror
and
indignation
and
which
he
declared
to
be
unfit
for
any
bishop
whatever
to
make
see
page
part
iii
gregory
did
much
to
bring
over
the
lombards
from
their
arianism
and
he
succeeded
in
part
although
the
work
was
not
completed
until
after
his
time
he
also
laboured
earnestly
to
revive
the
church
in
france
and
in
other
countries
but
instead
of
dwelling
on
these
things
i
shall
content
myself
with
telling
of
the
chief
work
which
he
did
in
spreading
the
gospel
and
it
is
one
which
very
much
concerns
ourselves
in
those
days
slavery
was
common
throughout
all
the
known
world
and
although
the
gospel
had
wrought
a
great
improvement
in
the
treatment
of
slaves
by
making
the
masters
feel
that
they
and
their
slaves
were
brethren
in
christ
it
yet
had
not
forbidden
slavery
but
there
was
a
feeling
of
pity
for
those
who
fell
into
this
sad
condition
by
the
chances
of
war
or
otherwise
it
was
a
common
act
of
charity
for
good
christians
to
redeem
captives
and
to
set
them
at
liberty
this
indeed
was
thought
so
holy
a
work
and
so
agreeable
to
the
words
of
scripture
i
will
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
vi
ix
that
bishops
often
broke
up
and
sold
even
the
consecrated
plate
of
their
churches
in
order
that
they
might
get
the
means
of
ransoming
captives
whom
they
heard
of
and
although
slavery
was
still
allowed
by
the
laws
of
christian
kingdoms
those
laws
took
care
that
christian
slaves
should
not
be
under
jews
or
masters
of
any
other
than
their
own
religion
gregory
then
while
he
was
yet
a
monk
went
one
day
into
the
market
at
rome
just
after
the
arrival
of
some
merchants
with
a
large
cargo
of
slaves
for
sale
some
of
these
poor
creatures
perhaps
had
been
taken
in
war
others
had
probably
been
sold
by
their
own
parents
for
the
sake
of
the
price
which
they
fetched
for
we
are
told
that
this
shocking
practice
was
not
uncommon
among
some
of
the
ruder
nations
as
gregory
looked
at
them
his
eyes
fell
on
some
boys
with
whose
appearance
he
was
greatly
struck
their
skin
was
fair
unlike
the
dark
complexions
of
the
italians
and
other
southern
nations
whom
he
had
been
used
to
see
their
features
were
beautiful
and
they
had
long
light
flowing
hair
he
asked
the
merchants
from
what
land
these
boys
had
been
brought
from
britain
they
said
and
they
told
him
that
the
bright
complexion
which
he
admired
so
much
was
common
among
the
people
of
that
island
perhaps
gregory
had
never
thought
of
britain
before
it
was
nearly
two
hundred
years
since
the
roman
troops
had
been
withdrawn
from
it
and
its
inhabitants
had
been
left
to
themselves
and
since
that
time
the
pagan
saxons
had
overrun
it
the
romans
had
lost
the
countries
which
lay
between
them
and
it
and
britain
had
quite
disappeared
from
their
knowledge
gregory
therefore
was
obliged
to
ask
whether
the
people
were
christians
or
heathens
and
he
was
told
that
they
were
still
heathens
the
good
monk
sighed
deeply
alas
and
woe
said
he
that
people
with
such
faces
of
light
should
belong
to
the
author
of
darkness
and
that
so
goodly
an
outward
favour
should
be
void
of
inward
grace
he
asked
what
was
the
name
of
their
nation
and
was
told
that
they
were
it
is
well
he
said
for
they
have
faces
and
such
as
they
ought
to
be
with
the
angels
in
what
is
the
name
of
the
province
from
which
they
come
he
was
told
that
it
was
deira
a
saxon
kingdom
which
stretched
along
the
eastern
side
of
britain
from
the
humber
to
the
tyne
the
name
of
deira
sounded
to
gregory
ears
like
two
latin
words
which
mean
from
wrath
well
again
he
said
they
are
delivered
the
of
god
and
are
called
to
the
mercy
of
what
is
the
name
of
the
king
of
that
country
aella
was
the
answer
alleluiah
to
god
exclaimed
gregory
the
praises
of
god
their
maker
ought
to
be
sung
in
that
kingdom
he
went
at
once
to
the
pope
and
asked
leave
to
go
as
a
missionary
to
the
heathens
of
britain
but
although
the
pope
consented
the
people
of
rome
were
so
much
attached
to
gregory
that
they
would
not
allow
him
to
set
out
and
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
plan
yet
he
did
not
forget
the
heathens
of
britain
and
when
he
became
pope
although
he
could
not
himself
go
to
them
he
was
able
to
send
others
for
the
work
of
their
conversion
an
opening
had
been
made
by
the
marriage
of
ethelbert
king
of
kent
the
saxon
kingdom
which
lay
nearest
to
the
continent
with
bertha
daughter
of
charibert
a
frankish
king
whose
capital
was
paris
as
charibert
and
his
family
were
christians
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
young
queen
should
be
allowed
freely
to
practise
her
religion
and
a
french
bishop
named
luidhard
came
to
england
with
her
and
acted
as
her
chaplain
ethelbert
by
degrees
became
much
more
powerful
than
he
was
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
in
he
was
chosen
bretwalda
which
was
the
title
given
to
the
chief
of
the
saxon
kings
this
office
gave
him
much
influence
over
most
of
the
other
kingdoms
so
that
if
his
favour
could
be
gained
it
was
likely
to
be
of
very
great
advantage
for
recommending
the
gospel
to
others
but
ethelbert
was
still
a
heathen
after
having
been
married
to
bertha
about
years
although
we
may
well
suppose
that
she
had
sometimes
spoken
to
him
of
her
religion
and
had
tried
to
bring
him
over
to
it
and
perhaps
bertha
may
have
had
a
share
in
sending
gregory
the
reports
which
he
mentions
that
the
saxons
in
england
were
ready
to
receive
the
gospel
and
in
begging
him
to
take
pity
on
them
part
iv
in
the
year
gregory
sent
off
a
party
of
monks
as
missionaries
to
the
english
saxons
the
head
of
them
was
augustine
who
had
been
provost
that
is
the
highest
person
after
the
abbot
of
the
monastery
to
which
the
pope
himself
had
formerly
belonged
and
at
the
same
time
gregory
directed
the
manager
of
his
estates
in
france
to
buy
up
a
number
of
captive
saxon
youths
and
to
place
them
in
monasteries
that
they
might
learn
the
christian
faith
and
might
afterwards
become
missionaries
to
their
own
countrymen
see
page
when
augustine
and
his
brethren
had
got
as
for
as
the
south
of
france
they
heard
many
terrible
stories
of
the
english
so
they
took
fright
at
the
thought
of
going
among
such
savages
whose
very
language
was
unknown
to
them
and
augustine
went
back
to
rome
to
beg
that
they
might
be
allowed
to
give
up
their
undertaking
but
gregory
would
not
consent
to
this
he
encouraged
them
to
go
on
and
he
gave
augustine
letters
to
some
french
kings
and
bishops
desiring
them
to
assist
the
missionaries
and
to
supply
them
with
interpreters
who
understood
the
language
of
the
saxons
augustine
therefore
returned
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
his
companions
they
made
their
way
across
france
and
in
he
landed
with
about
forty
monks
in
the
isle
of
thanet
ethelbert
lived
at
canterbury
the
capital
of
the
kentish
kingdom
at
no
great
distance
from
the
place
where
the
missionaries
had
landed
on
receiving
notice
of
their
arrival
he
sent
to
desire
that
they
would
remain
where
they
were
until
he
should
visit
them
and
within
a
few
days
he
went
to
them
the
meeting
was
held
in
the
open
air
for
ethelbert
had
a
superstitious
fear
that
they
might
do
him
some
mischief
by
magical
arts
if
he
were
to
trust
himself
under
a
roof
with
them
the
missionaries
advanced
in
procession
with
a
silver
cross
borne
before
them
and
displaying
a
picture
of
the
crucified
saviour
and
as
they
slowly
moved
onwards
they
chanted
a
prayer
for
their
own
salvation
and
that
of
the
people
to
whom
they
had
been
sent
ethelbert
received
them
courteously
and
desired
them
to
sit
down
and
then
augustine
made
a
speech
telling
the
king
that
they
were
come
to
preach
the
word
of
life
to
him
and
to
his
subjects
these
are
indeed
fair
words
and
promises
which
you
bring
with
you
said
ethelbert
but
because
they
are
new
and
uncertain
i
can
not
at
once
take
up
with
them
and
leave
the
faith
which
i
and
all
my
people
have
so
long
observed
but
as
you
have
come
from
far
and
as
i
think
you
wish
to
give
us
a
share
in
things
which
you
believe
to
be
true
and
most
profitable
we
will
not
show
you
unkindness
but
rather
will
receive
you
hospitably
and
not
hinder
you
from
converting
as
many
as
you
can
to
your
religion
he
then
granted
them
a
lodging
in
his
capital
and
ordered
that
they
should
be
supplied
with
all
that
they
might
need
as
they
drew
near
to
canterbury
they
again
displayed
the
silver
cross
and
the
banner
on
which
the
saviour
was
painted
and
they
entered
the
city
in
procession
chanting
a
litany
which
gregory
had
made
for
the
people
of
rome
during
the
great
plague
which
carried
off
pope
pelagius
a
little
way
outside
the
city
they
found
a
small
church
which
had
been
built
in
the
days
of
the
old
british
christianity
and
in
which
luidhard
had
since
held
his
service
for
queen
bertha
and
the
christians
of
her
court
it
was
called
by
the
name
of
martin
for
even
before
the
saxon
invasion
his
name
had
become
so
famous
that
many
churches
were
called
after
it
and
we
may
well
believe
that
queen
bertha
on
arriving
from
france
was
glad
to
find
that
the
church
in
which
she
was
to
worship
had
long
ago
been
named
in
honour
of
the
great
saint
of
her
own
land
there
augustine
and
his
brethren
now
held
their
service
and
the
sight
of
their
holy
gentle
and
lives
soon
drew
many
to
receive
their
instructions
ethelbert
himself
was
baptized
on
whitsunday
and
although
he
would
not
force
his
people
to
profess
the
gospel
he
declared
himself
desirous
of
their
conversion
gregory
had
desired
augustine
if
he
met
with
success
in
the
beginning
of
his
mission
to
return
from
britain
into
france
and
be
consecrated
as
a
bishop
he
now
obeyed
this
direction
and
was
consecrated
at
arles
and
without
any
delay
he
again
crossed
the
sea
and
renewed
his
labours
among
the
saxons
such
was
his
progress
in
the
work
of
conversion
that
at
christmas
of
the
year
in
which
he
first
landed
in
britain
ten
thousand
persons
were
baptized
in
one
day
four
years
later
gregory
made
him
an
archbishop
and
he
sent
him
a
fresh
body
of
clergy
to
help
him
with
a
large
supply
of
books
vestments
and
other
things
for
the
service
of
the
church
he
also
gave
him
instructions
how
to
proceed
so
as
to
advance
the
true
faith
without
giving
needless
offence
to
the
prejudices
of
the
heathen
augustine
chief
difficulties
indeed
were
not
with
the
saxons
but
with
the
clergy
of
the
ancient
british
church
whom
he
could
not
succeed
in
bringing
to
an
agreement
we
must
not
lay
the
blame
wholly
on
either
side
if
the
britons
were
somewhat
jealous
and
obstinate
augustine
seems
to
have
taken
too
much
upon
himself
in
his
way
of
dealing
with
them
but
whatever
his
faults
may
have
been
we
are
bound
to
hold
his
memory
in
honour
for
the
zealous
and
successful
labours
by
which
the
gospel
was
a
second
time
introduced
into
the
southern
part
of
this
island
before
his
death
in
he
had
established
a
second
bishop
for
kent
in
the
city
of
rochester
and
one
at
london
which
was
then
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
of
essex
and
by
degrees
partly
by
the
followers
of
augustine
and
partly
by
the
scotch
monks
of
icolumbkill
all
the
saxon
kingdoms
of
england
were
converted
to
the
christian
faith
see
page
in
the
same
year
with
augustine
gregory
also
died
after
long
and
severe
illness
which
obliged
him
for
years
to
keep
his
bed
but
could
not
check
his
activity
in
watching
over
the
interests
of
religion
gregory
had
intended
that
augustine
should
be
archbishop
of
london
because
in
the
old
roman
days
london
had
been
the
chief
city
of
britain
and
it
might
seem
natural
that
the
chief
bishop
of
our
church
should
now
take
his
title
from
the
capital
of
all
england
but
when
gregory
sent
forth
his
missionaries
he
did
not
know
that
england
had
been
divided
by
the
saxons
into
several
kingdoms
in
consequence
of
this
division
of
the
country
augustine
instead
of
becoming
archbishop
of
london
fixed
himself
in
the
capital
of
kent
the
first
kingdom
which
he
converted
and
then
the
most
powerful
of
all
hence
it
is
that
his
successors
the
primates
of
all
england
to
this
day
are
not
archbishops
of
london
but
of
canterbury
and
although
canterbury
be
not
now
a
very
large
town
it
is
a
very
interesting
place
and
is
full
of
memorials
of
its
first
archbishop
the
noble
cathedral
called
christ
church
stands
in
the
same
place
with
an
ancient
church
which
augustine
recovered
from
heathen
uses
and
consecrated
in
honour
of
the
saviour
close
to
it
are
the
remains
of
the
archbishop
palace
built
on
the
same
ground
with
the
palace
of
ethelbert
which
he
gave
up
to
the
missionaries
a
little
church
of
martin
still
stands
on
a
rising
ground
outside
the
city
on
the
spot
where
bertha
and
luidhard
had
worshipped
before
the
arrival
of
augustine
and
where
he
and
his
brethren
celebrated
their
earliest
services
and
although
it
has
been
rebuilt
since
then
we
may
still
see
in
its
walls
a
number
of
bricks
which
by
their
appearance
are
known
to
be
roman
the
very
same
materials
of
which
the
little
church
was
built
at
first
while
the
romans
were
yet
in
britain
fourteen
centuries
and
a
half
ago
nay
it
is
even
supposed
that
some
part
of
the
masonry
is
roman
too
between
martin
and
the
cathedral
lay
the
great
monastery
of
peter
and
paul
which
augustine
began
to
build
he
died
before
it
was
finished
but
as
soon
as
it
was
ready
his
body
was
removed
to
it
and
in
it
queen
bertha
and
her
husband
were
afterwards
buried
after
a
time
the
name
of
the
monastery
was
changed
to
augustine
and
for
hundreds
of
years
it
was
the
chief
monastery
of
all
england
the
reformation
in
the
sixteenth
century
put
an
end
to
monasteries
and
the
buildings
of
augustine
went
through
many
changes
until
in
the
year
the
place
was
turned
to
a
purpose
similar
to
that
which
augustine
and
gregory
had
at
heart
when
they
undertook
the
conversion
of
england
for
it
is
now
a
college
for
training
missionaries
and
as
gregory
wished
that
saxon
boys
should
be
brought
up
with
a
view
to
converting
their
countrymen
so
there
are
now
at
augustine
college
young
men
from
distant
heathen
nations
receiving
an
education
which
may
fit
them
hereafter
to
become
missionaries
of
the
church
of
england
to
their
brethren
nor
is
the
good
gregory
forgotten
in
the
city
which
owes
so
much
to
him
for
within
the
last
few
years
a
beautiful
little
church
called
by
his
name
has
been
built
close
to
the
college
of
augustine
among
those
who
were
at
the
college
when
this
volume
was
first
printed
was
kalli
the
esquimaux
of
whom
an
account
has
since
been
written
by
the
rev
murray
and
published
by
the
society
for
promoting
christian
knowledge
he
afterwards
went
to
the
diocese
of
newfoundland
where
he
died
of
consumption
here
this
little
book
must
close
it
ends
with
the
replanting
of
the
gospel
in
our
own
land
and
if
hereafter
the
story
should
be
carried
further
some
of
its
brightest
pages
will
be
filled
by
the
labours
of
the
missionaries
who
went
forth
from
england
to
preach
the
faith
of
christ
in
germany
and
the
adjoining
countries
part
ii
chapter
mahometanism
within
a
few
years
after
the
death
of
gregory
the
great
a
new
religion
was
set
up
by
an
arabian
named
mahomet
who
seems
to
have
been
honest
although
mistaken
at
first
but
grew
less
honest
as
he
went
on
and
as
he
became
more
successful
and
powerful
his
religion
was
made
up
partly
from
the
jewish
partly
from
the
christian
and
partly
from
other
religions
which
he
found
around
him
but
he
gave
out
that
it
had
been
taught
him
by
visions
and
revelations
from
heaven
and
these
pretended
revelations
were
gathered
into
a
book
called
the
koran
which
serves
mahomet
followers
for
their
bible
this
new
religion
was
called
which
means
submission
to
the
will
of
god
and
the
sum
of
it
was
declared
to
be
that
there
is
but
one
god
and
mahomet
is
his
prophet
one
point
in
the
new
religion
was
that
every
faithful
mahometan
or
mussulman
as
they
were
called
was
required
once
in
his
life
to
go
on
pilgrimage
to
mecca
a
city
which
was
mahomet
birthplace
and
was
considered
to
be
especially
holy
and
to
this
day
it
is
visited
every
year
by
great
companies
of
pilgrims
another
remarkable
thing
was
that
he
commanded
his
followers
to
spread
their
religion
by
force
and
this
was
done
with
such
success
that
within
about
sixty
years
after
mahomet
death
they
had
conquered
syria
and
the
holy
land
egypt
persia
parts
of
asia
minor
and
all
the
north
of
africa
a
little
later
they
crossed
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
got
possession
of
spain
where
their
kingdom
of
granada
lasted
until
nearly
eight
hundred
years
in
the
countries
which
the
mussulmans
subdued
christians
were
allowed
to
live
and
to
keep
up
their
religion
but
they
had
to
pay
a
heavy
tribute
and
to
bear
great
hardships
and
disgraces
at
the
hands
of
the
conquerors
i
have
mentioned
that
before
gregory
the
great
time
almost
all
europe
had
been
overrun
by
the
rude
nations
of
the
north
learning
nearly
died
out
and
what
remained
of
it
was
kept
up
by
the
monks
and
clergy
only
there
is
but
little
to
tell
of
the
history
of
those
times
for
although
in
the
greek
empire
there
were
great
disputes
about
some
doctrines
and
practices
these
matters
were
such
as
you
would
not
care
to
know
about
nor
would
you
be
much
the
wiser
if
you
did
know
see
part
chap
xxiii
i
may
however
mention
that
one
of
these
disputes
was
about
images
to
which
the
christians
of
those
ages
and
especially
the
greeks
had
come
by
degrees
to
pay
a
sort
of
reverence
which
augustine
and
other
fathers
of
older
days
would
have
looked
on
with
horror
it
had
become
usual
to
fall
down
before
images
to
pray
to
them
to
kiss
them
to
burn
lights
and
incense
in
their
honour
to
adorn
them
with
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
to
lay
the
hand
on
them
in
taking
oaths
and
even
to
use
them
as
godfathers
or
godmothers
for
children
in
baptism
those
who
defend
the
use
of
images
would
tell
us
that
the
honour
is
not
given
to
them
but
to
almighty
god
to
the
saviour
and
to
the
saints
through
the
images
but
when
we
find
for
instance
that
people
paid
more
honour
to
one
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
than
to
another
and
that
they
supposed
their
prayers
to
have
a
greater
hope
of
being
heard
when
they
were
said
before
one
image
than
when
they
were
said
before
another
we
can
not
help
thinking
that
they
believed
the
images
themselves
to
have
some
particular
virtue
in
them
there
were
then
some
of
the
greek
emperors
who
tried
to
put
down
the
superstitious
regard
for
images
and
they
were
the
more
set
on
this
because
the
mahometans
who
abhorred
images
reproached
the
christians
for
using
them
these
emperors
wishing
to
do
away
with
the
grounds
for
such
reproaches
caused
the
figures
of
stone
or
metal
to
be
broken
and
the
sacred
pictures
to
be
smeared
over
and
they
persecuted
very
cruelly
those
who
were
foremost
in
defending
them
then
came
other
emperors
who
were
in
favour
of
images
or
widowed
empresses
who
governed
during
the
boyhood
of
their
sons
and
took
up
the
cause
of
images
with
great
zeal
and
thus
the
friends
and
the
enemies
of
images
succeeded
each
other
by
turns
on
the
throne
so
that
the
battle
was
fought
backwards
and
forwards
for
a
long
time
until
at
length
an
agreement
was
come
to
which
has
ever
since
continued
in
the
greek
church
by
this
agreement
it
was
settled
that
the
figures
made
by
carving
in
stone
or
wood
or
by
casting
metal
into
a
mould
should
be
forbidden
but
that
the
use
of
religious
pictures
which
were
also
called
by
the
name
of
images
should
be
allowed
hence
it
is
said
that
the
greeks
may
not
worship
anything
of
which
one
can
take
the
tip
of
the
nose
between
his
finger
and
his
thumb
but
in
the
latin
church
the
carved
or
molten
images
are
still
allowed
and
among
the
poorer
and
less
educated
people
there
is
a
great
deal
of
superstition
connected
with
them

the
church
in

the
light
of
the

was
darkened
by

world
where
it
had

brightly
it
was

by

was

named
columba
had
settled
with
some
companions
about
the
year
and
from
iona
their
teaching
had
been
carried
all
over
the
northern
part
of
britain
these
missionaries
from
iona
to
england
found
a
home
in
the
island
of
lindisfarne
on
the
northumbrian
coast
which
was
given
up
to
them
by
oswald
king
of
northumbria
and
from
them
got
the
name
of
holy
island
oswald
himself
had
been
converted
while
an
exile
in
scotland
and
as
he
had
learnt
the
language
of
the
country
there
he
often
helped
the
missionaries
in
their
labours
by
interpreting
what
they
said
into
the
language
of
his
own
subjects
who
listened
to
them
the
scottish
missionaries
carried
their
labours
even
as
far
south
as
the
river
thames
and
their
modest
and
humble
ways
gained
the
respect
and
love
of
the
people
so
much
that
as
we
are
told
by
the
venerable
bede
wherever
one
of
them
appeared
he
was
joyfully
received
as
the
servant
of
god
even
those
who
met
them
on
the
road
used
eagerly
to
ask
their
blessing
and
whenever
one
of
them
came
to
any
village
the
inhabitants
flocked
to
hear
from
him
the
message
of
the
gospel
part
but
these
scottish
missionaries
differed
in
some
respects
from
the
clergy
who
were
connected
with
augustine
and
after
a
time
a
great
meeting
was
held
at
whitby
in
yorkshire
to
settle
the
questions
between
them
and
the
roman
church
we
must
not
suppose
that
these
differences
were
of
any
real
importance
for
they
were
only
about
such
small
matters
as
the
reckoning
of
the
day
on
which
easter
should
be
kept
and
the
way
in
which
the
hair
of
the
clergy
should
be
clipped
or
shaven
but
although
these
were
mere
trifles
the
two
parties
were
each
so
set
on
their
own
ways
that
no
agreement
could
be
come
to
and
the
end
was
that
the
scottish
missionaries
went
back
to
their
own
country
and
did
no
more
work
for
spreading
the
gospel
in
england
although
after
a
while
the
scottish
clergy
and
those
of
ireland
too
were
persuaded
to
shave
their
hair
and
to
reckon
their
easter
in
the
same
way
as
the
other
clergy
of
the
west
in
those
dark
times
some
of
the
most
learned
and
famous
men
were
english
monks
among
them
i
shall
mention
only
bede
who
is
commonly
called
the
venerable
and
to
whose
care
we
owe
almost
all
our
knowledge
of
the
early
history
of
the
church
in
this
land
bede
was
born
about
the
year
near
jarrow
in
northumberland
and
at
the
age
of
seven
he
entered
the
monastery
of
jarrow
where
the
rest
of
his
life
was
spent
he
tells
us
of
himself
that
he
made
it
his
pleasure
every
day
either
to
learn
or
to
teach
or
to
write
something
and
after
having
written
many
precious
books
during
his
quiet
life
in
his
cell
at
jarrow
he
died
on
the
eve
of
in
the
year
just
as
he
had
finished
a
translation
of
john
gospel
chapter
iii
boniface
although
the
church
of
ireland
was
in
a
somewhat
rough
state
at
home
many
of
its
clergy
undertook
missionary
work
on
the
continent
and
by
them
and
others
much
was
done
for
the
conversion
of
various
tribes
in
germany
and
in
the
netherlands
but
the
most
famous
missionary
of
those
times
was
an
englishman
named
winfrid
who
is
styled
the
apostle
of
germany
winfrid
was
born
near
crediton
in
devonshire
about
the
year
he
became
a
monk
at
an
early
age
and
perhaps
it
was
then
that
he
took
the
name
of
boniface
by
which
he
is
best
known
he
might
probably
have
risen
to
a
high
place
in
the
church
of
his
own
country
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
but
he
was
filled
with
a
glowing
desire
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
heathen
he
therefore
refused
all
the
tempting
offers
which
were
made
to
him
at
home
crossed
the
sea
and
began
to
labour
in
friesland
and
about
the
lower
part
of
the
rhine
for
three
years
he
assisted
another
famous
english
missionary
willibrord
bishop
of
utrecht
who
wished
to
make
boniface
his
successor
but
boniface
thought
that
he
was
bound
rather
to
labour
in
some
country
where
his
work
was
more
needed
so
leaving
willibrord
he
went
into
hessia
where
he
made
and
baptized
many
thousands
of
converts
the
pope
gregory
the
second
on
hearing
of
this
success
invited
him
to
rome
consecrated
him
as
a
bishop
and
sent
him
back
with
letters
recommending
him
to
the
princes
and
people
of
the
countries
in
which
his
work
was
to
lie
the
government
of
the
franks
was
then
in
a
very
odd
state
there
were
kings
over
them
but
these
kings
instead
of
carrying
on
the
government
for
themselves
and
leading
their
nation
in
war
were
shut
up
in
their
palaces
except
that
once
in
the
year
they
were
brought
out
in
a
cart
drawn
by
bullocks
to
appear
at
the
national
assemblies
these
poor
as
the
kings
of
the
old
french
race
are
called
were
without
any
strength
or
spirit
from
their
way
of
life
they
allowed
their
hair
to
grow
without
being
shorn
and
the
greeks
who
lived
far
away
from
them
and
knew
of
them
only
by
hearsay
believed
not
only
that
their
hair
was
long
but
that
it
grew
down
their
backs
like
the
bristles
of
a
hog
and
while
the
kings
had
sunk
into
this
pitiable
state
the
real
work
of
the
kingly
office
was
done
and
the
kingly
power
was
really
enjoyed
by
great
officers
who
were
called
mayors
of
the
palace
at
the
time
which
i
am
speaking
of
the
mayor
of
the
palace
was
charles
who
was
afterwards
known
by
the
name
of
martel
or
charles
had
done
a
great
service
to
christendom
by
defeating
a
vast
army
of
mahometans
who
had
forced
their
way
from
spain
into
the
heart
of
france
and
driving
the
remains
of
them
back
across
the
pyrenees
it
is
said
that
they
lost
men
in
the
battle
which
they
fought
with
charles
near
poitiers
and
although
this
number
is
no
doubt
beyond
the
truth
it
is
certain
that
the
infidels
were
so
much
weakened
that
they
never
ventured
to
attempt
any
more
conquests
in
western
europe
but
although
charles
had
thus
done
very
great
things
for
the
christian
world
it
would
seem
that
he
himself
did
not
care
much
for
religion
and
although
he
gave
boniface
a
letter
of
protection
he
did
not
help
or
encourage
him
greatly
in
his
missionary
labours
but
boniface
was
resolved
to
carry
on
bravely
what
he
believed
to
be
work
he
preached
in
hessia
and
thuringia
and
made
many
thousands
of
converts
he
built
churches
and
monasteries
and
brought
over
from
england
large
numbers
of
clergy
to
help
him
in
preaching
and
in
the
christian
training
of
his
converts
for
which
purpose
he
also
obtained
supplies
of
books
from
his
own
country
he
founded
bishoprics
and
held
councils
of
clergy
and
laymen
for
the
settlement
of
the
affairs
finding
that
the
hessians
paid
reverence
to
an
old
which
was
sacred
to
one
of
their
gods
he
resolved
to
cut
it
down
the
heathens
stood
around
looking
fiercely
at
him
cursing
and
threatening
him
and
expecting
to
see
him
and
his
companions
struck
dead
by
the
vengeance
of
their
gods
but
when
he
had
only
just
begun
to
attack
the
oak
we
are
told
that
a
great
wind
suddenly
arose
and
struck
it
so
that
it
fell
to
the
ground
in
four
pieces
the
people
seeing
this
took
it
for
a
sign
from
heaven
and
consented
to
give
up
their
old
idolatry
and
boniface
turned
the
wood
of
the
huge
old
oak
to
use
by
building
a
chapel
with
it
in
some
places
boniface
found
a
strange
mixture
of
heathen
superstitions
with
christianity
and
he
did
all
that
he
could
to
root
them
out
he
had
also
much
trouble
with
missionaries
from
ireland
whose
notions
of
christian
doctrine
and
practice
differed
in
some
things
from
his
and
perhaps
he
did
not
always
treat
them
with
so
much
of
wisdom
and
gentleness
as
might
have
been
wished
but
after
all
he
was
right
in
thinking
that
the
sight
of
more
than
one
kind
of
christian
religion
different
from
each
other
and
opposed
to
each
other
must
puzzle
the
heathen
and
hinder
their
conversion
so
that
we
can
understand
his
jealousy
of
those
irish
missionaries
even
if
we
can
not
wholly
approve
of
it
in
reward
of
his
labours
and
success
boniface
was
made
an
archbishop
by
pope
gregory
iii
in
and
although
at
first
he
was
not
fixed
in
any
one
place
he
soon
brought
the
german
church
into
such
a
state
of
order
that
it
seemed
to
be
time
for
choosing
some
city
as
the
seat
of
its
chief
bishop
just
as
the
chief
bishop
of
england
was
settled
at
canterbury
boniface
himself
wished
to
fix
himself
at
cologne
but
at
that
very
time
the
bishop
of
mentz
got
into
trouble
by
killing
a
saxon
who
in
a
former
war
had
killed
the
bishop
father
although
it
had
been
quite
a
common
thing
in
those
rough
days
for
bishops
to
take
a
part
in
fighting
boniface
and
his
councils
had
made
rules
forbidding
such
things
as
unbecoming
the
ministers
of
peace
and
the
case
of
the
bishop
of
mentz
coming
just
after
those
rules
had
been
made
could
not
well
be
passed
over
the
bishop
therefore
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
see
and
mentz
was
chosen
to
be
the
place
where
boniface
should
be
fixed
as
archbishop
and
primate
of
germany
having
under
him
five
bishops
and
all
the
nations
which
had
received
the
gospel
through
his
preaching
when
boniface
had
grown
old
he
felt
himself
again
drawn
to
frisia
where
as
we
have
seen
he
had
laboured
in
his
early
life
and
at
the
age
of
he
left
his
archbishopric
with
all
that
invited
him
to
spend
his
last
days
there
in
quiet
and
honour
that
he
might
once
more
go
forth
as
a
missionary
to
the
barbarous
frieslanders
among
them
he
preached
with
much
success
but
on
whitsun
eve
while
he
was
expecting
a
great
number
of
his
converts
to
meet
that
they
might
receive
confirmation
from
him
he
and
his
companions
were
attacked
by
an
armed
party
of
heathens
and
the
whole
of
the
missionaries
in
number
were
martyred
but
although
boniface
thus
ended
his
active
and
useful
life
by
martyrdom
at
the
hands
of
those
whom
he
wished
to
bring
into
the
way
of
salvation
his
work
was
carried
on
by
other
missionaries
and
the
conversion
of
the
frisians
was
completed
within
no
long
time
boniface
body
was
carried
up
the
rhine
and
was
buried
at
fulda
a
monastery
which
he
had
founded
amidst
the
loneliness
of
a
vast
forest
and
there
the
tomb
of
the
apostle
of
the
germans
was
visited
with
reverence
for
centuries

pipin
and

the
great
part
i
towards
the
end
of
boniface
life
a
great
change
took
place
in
the
government
of
the
franks
pipin
who
had
succeeded
his
father
charles
martel
as
mayor
of
the
palace
grew
tired
of
being
called
a
servant
while
he
was
really
the
master
and
the
french
sent
to
ask
the
pope
whose
name
was
zacharias
whether
the
man
who
really
had
the
kingly
power
ought
not
also
to
have
the
title
of
king
zacharias
who
had
been
greatly
obliged
to
the
franks
for
helping
him
against
his
enemies
the
lombards
answered
them
in
the
way
that
they
seemed
to
wish
and
to
expect
and
accordingly
they
chose
pipin
as
their
king
and
while
according
to
the
custom
in
such
cases
pipin
was
lifted
up
on
a
shield
and
displayed
to
the
people
while
he
was
anointed
and
crowned
the
last
of
the
poor
old
race
of
kings
was
forced
to
let
his
long
hair
be
shorn
until
he
looked
like
a
monk
and
was
then
shut
up
in
a
monastery
for
the
rest
of
his
days
pipin
afterwards
went
into
italy
for
the
help
of
the
pope
and
bestowed
on
the
roman
church
a
large
tract
of
country
which
he
had
taken
from
the
lombards
and
this
as
it
was
called
or
gift
was
the
first
land
which
the
popes
possessed
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
counted
as
the
sovereigns
of
it
pipin
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
charles
who
is
commonly
called
charlemagne
or
charles
the
great
under
charles
the
connexion
between
the
franks
and
the
popes
became
still
closer
than
before
and
when
charles
put
down
the
lombard
kingdom
in
italy
the
popes
came
in
for
part
of
the
spoil
but
the
most
remarkable
effect
of
this
connexion
was
at
a
later
time
when
pope
leo
iii
had
been
attacked
in
a
roman
street
by
some
conspirators
who
tried
to
blind
him
and
to
cut
out
his
tongue
but
they
were
not
able
to
do
their
work
thoroughly
and
leo
recovered
the
use
both
of
his
tongue
and
of
his
eyes
he
then
went
into
germany
to
ask
charles
to
help
him
against
his
enemies
and
on
his
return
to
rome
he
was
followed
by
charles
there
on
christmas
day
when
a
vast
congregation
was
assembled
in
the
great
church
of
peter
the
pope
suddenly
placed
a
golden
crown
on
the
king
head
while
the
people
shouted
long
life
and
victory
to
our
emperor
charles
so
now
after
a
long
time
an
emperor
was
set
up
again
in
the
west
and
although
these
new
emperors
were
german
they
all
styled
themselves
emperors
of
the
romans
the
popes
afterwards
pretended
that
they
had
a
right
to
bestow
the
empire
as
they
liked
and
that
leo
had
taken
it
from
the
greeks
and
given
it
to
the
germans
but
this
was
quite
untrue
charles
seems
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
be
emperor
but
he
was
very
angry
with
the
pope
for
giving
him
the
crown
by
surprise
instead
of
letting
him
take
his
own
way
about
it
and
if
he
had
been
left
to
himself
he
would
have
taken
care
to
manage
the
matter
so
that
the
pope
should
not
appear
to
do
anything
more
than
to
crown
him
in
form
after
he
had
been
chosen
by
the
roman
people
part
ii
charles
was
really
a
great
man
although
he
had
very
serious
faults
and
did
many
blameable
things
he
carried
his
conquests
so
far
that
the
greeks
had
a
proverb
have
the
frank
for
thy
friend
but
not
for
thy
neighbour
meaning
that
the
franks
were
likely
to
try
to
make
their
neighbours
lands
their
own
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
spread
the
christian
faith
by
force
if
it
could
not
be
done
in
a
gentler
way
and
thus
when
he
had
conquered
the
saxons
in
germany
he
made
them
be
baptized
and
pay
tithes
to
the
church
but
i
need
hardly
say
that
people
belief
is
not
to
be
forced
in
this
way
and
many
of
those
who
submitted
to
be
baptized
at
the
conqueror
command
had
no
belief
in
the
gospel
and
no
understanding
of
it
there
is
a
story
told
of
some
who
came
to
be
baptized
over
and
over
again
for
the
sake
of
the
white
dresses
which
were
given
to
them
at
their
baptism
and
when
one
of
these
had
once
got
a
dress
which
was
coarser
than
usual
he
declared
that
such
a
sack
was
fitter
for
a
swineherd
than
for
a
warrior
and
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
or
with
the
christian
religion
the
saxons
gave
charles
a
great
deal
of
trouble
for
his
war
with
them
lasted
no
less
than
years
and
at
one
time
he
was
so
much
provoked
by
their
frequent
revolts
that
he
had
the
cruelty
to
put
saxon
prisoners
to
death
but
there
are
better
things
to
be
told
of
charles
he
took
very
great
pains
to
restore
learning
which
had
long
been
in
a
state
of
decay
he
invited
learned
men
from
italy
and
from
england
to
settle
in
his
kingdom
and
of
all
these
the
most
famous
was
a
northumbrian
named
alcuin
alcuin
gave
him
wise
and
good
advice
as
to
the
best
way
of
treating
the
saxons
in
order
to
bring
them
to
the
faith
and
when
charles
was
on
his
way
to
rome
just
before
he
was
crowned
as
emperor
alcuin
presented
him
with
a
large
latin
bible
written
expressly
for
his
use
for
we
must
remember
that
printing
was
not
invented
until
more
than
six
hundred
years
later
so
that
all
books
in
charles
days
were
or
written
by
hand
some
people
have
believed
that
an
ancient
manuscript
bible
which
is
now
to
be
seen
in
the
great
library
at
paris
is
the
very
one
which
alcuin
gave
to
charles
we
are
told
that
when
charles
found
himself
at
a
loss
for
help
in
educating
his
people
he
said
to
alcuin
that
he
wished
he
might
have
twelve
such
learned
clerks
as
jerome
and
augustine
and
that
alcuin
answered
the
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
has
had
only
two
such
and
are
you
so
unreasonable
as
to
wish
for
twelve
alcuin
was
made
master
of
the
palace
school
which
moved
about
wherever
the
court
was
and
in
which
the
pupils
were
charles
own
children
and
the
sons
of
his
chief
nobles
and
besides
this
care
was
taken
for
the
education
of
the
clergy
and
of
the
people
in
general
charles
himself
tried
very
hard
to
learn
reading
and
writing
when
he
was
already
in
middle
age
but
although
he
became
able
to
read
and
used
to
keep
little
tablets
under
his
pillow
in
order
that
he
might
practise
writing
while
lying
awake
in
bed
he
never
was
able
to
write
easily
many
curious
stories
are
told
of
the
way
in
which
he
overlooked
the
service
in
his
chapel
where
he
desired
that
everything
should
be
done
as
well
as
possible
he
would
point
with
his
finger
or
with
his
staff
at
any
person
whom
he
wished
to
read
in
chapel
and
when
he
wished
any
one
to
stop
he
coughed
and
it
was
expected
that
at
these
signals
each
person
would
begin
or
stop
at
once
although
it
might
be
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
during
this
time
the
question
of
images
which
i
have
already
mentioned
came
up
again
in
the
greek
church
a
council
was
held
in
at
nicæa
where
the
first
general
council
had
met
in
the
time
of
constantine
more
than
four
centuries
and
a
half
before
and
in
this
second
nicene
council
images
were
approved
of
in
the
west
the
popes
were
also
for
them
but
they
were
condemned
in
a
council
at
frankfort
and
a
book
was
written
against
them
in
the
name
of
charles
it
is
supposed
that
this
book
was
mostly
the
work
of
alcuin
but
that
charles
besides
allowing
it
to
go
forth
with
his
name
and
authority
had
really
himself
had
a
share
in

chapter
decay
of
charles
the
great
empire
lewis
the
son
of
charles
the
great
was
a
prince
who
had
very
much
of
good
in
him
so
that
he
is
commonly
called
the
pious
but
he
was
of
weak
character
and
his
reign
was
full
of
troubles
mostly
caused
by
the
ambition
of
his
own
sons
who
were
helped
by
a
strong
party
among
the
clergy
and
even
by
pope
gregory
the
fourth
at
one
time
he
was
obliged
to
undergo
public
penance
and
some
years
later
he
was
deprived
of
his
kingdom
and
empire
although
these
acts
caused
such
a
shock
to
the
feelings
of
men
that
he
found
friends
who
helped
him
to
recover
his
power
and
after
his
death
his
children
and
grandchildren
continued
to
quarrel
among
themselves
as
long
as
any
of
them
lived
besides
these
quarrels
among
their
princes
the
franks
were
troubled
at
this
time
by
enemies
of
many
kinds
first
of
all
i
may
mention
the
northmen
who
poured
down
by
sea
on
the
coasts
of
the
more
civilized
nations
these
were
the
same
who
in
our
english
history
are
called
danes
with
whom
the
great
alfred
had
a
long
struggle
and
who
afterwards
under
canute
got
possession
of
our
country
for
a
time
they
had
light
vessels
as
they
were
called
which
could
sail
up
rivers
and
so
they
carried
fire
and
sword
up
every
river
whose
opening
invited
them
making
their
way
to
places
so
far
off
the
sea
as
mentz
on
the
rhine
treves
on
the
moselle
paris
on
the
seine
and
even
auxerre
on
the
yonne
they
often
sacked
the
wealthy
trading
cities
which
lay
open
to
their
attacks
they
sailed
on
to
spain
plundered
lisbon
passed
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
laid
waste
the
coasts
of
italy
after
a
time
they
grew
bolder
and
would
leave
their
vessels
on
the
rivers
while
they
struck
across
the
country
to
plunder
places
which
were
known
to
be
wealthy
they
made
fortified
camps
often
on
the
islands
of
the
great
rivers
and
did
all
the
mischief
they
could
within
a
large
circle
around
them
these
northmen
were
bitter
enemies
of
christianity
and
many
of
them
had
lost
their
homes
because
they
or
their
fathers
would
not
be
converted
at
charlemagne
bidding
so
that
they
had
a
special
pleasure
in
turning
their
fury
against
churches
and
monasteries
wherever
they
came
the
monks
ran
off
and
tried
to
save
themselves
leaving
their
wealth
as
a
prey
to
the
strangers
people
were
afraid
to
till
the
land
lest
these
enemies
should
destroy
the
fruits
of
their
labours
famines
became
common
wolves
were
allowed
to
multiply
and
to
prey
without
check
and
such
were
the
distress
and
fear
caused
by
the
invaders
that
a
prayer
for
the
deliverance
from
the
fury
of
the
northmen
was
added
to
the
of
the
frankish
church
another
set
of
enemies
were
the
mahometan
saracens
who
got
possession
of
the
great
islands
of
the
mediterranean
and
laid
waste
its
coasts
it
is
said
that
some
of
them
sailed
up
the
tiber
and
carried
off
the
altar
which
covered
the
body
of
peter
one
party
of
saracens
settled
on
the
banks
of
a
river
about
halfway
between
rome
and
naples
others
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nice
and
on
that
part
of
the
alps
which
is
now
called
the
great
bernard
and
they
robbed
pilgrims
and
merchants
whom
they
made
to
pay
dearly
for
being
let
off
with
their
lives
europe
also
suffered
much
from
the
hungarians
a
very
rude
heathen
people
who
about
the
year
poured
into
it
from
asia
we
are
told
that
they
hardly
looked
human
that
they
lived
like
beasts
that
they
ate
men
flesh
and
drank
their
blood
they
rode
on
small
active
horses
so
that
the
cavalry
of
the
franks
could
not
overtake
them
and
if
they
ran
away
before
their
enemies
they
used
to
stop
from
time
to
time
and
let
fly
their
arrows
backwards
from
the
elbe
to
the
very
south
of
italy
these
barbarians
filled
europe
with
bloodshed
and
with
terror
the
northmen
at
length
made
themselves
so
much
feared
in
france
that
king
charles
who
was
called
the
simple
gave
up
to
them
in
a
part
of
his
kingdom
which
from
them
got
the
name
of
normandy
there
they
settled
down
to
a
very
different
sort
of
life
from
their
old
habits
of
piracy
and
plunder
so
that
before
long
the
normans
were
ahead
of
all
the
other
inhabitants
of
france
and
from
normandy
as
i
need
hardly
say
it
was
that
william
the
conqueror
and
his
warriors
came
to
gain
possession
of
england
the
princes
of
charles
the
great
family
by
their
quarrels
broke
up
his
empire
altogether
and
nobody
had
anything
like
the
power
of
an
emperor
until
otho
who
became
king
of
germany
in
and
was
crowned
emperor
at
rome
in
chapter
vi
state
of
the
papacy
all
this
time
the
papacy
was
in
a
very
sad
condition
popes
were
set
up
and
put
down
continually
and
some
of
them
were
put
to
death
by
their
enemies
the
body
of
one
pope
named
formosus
after
it
had
been
some
years
in
the
grave
was
taken
up
by
order
of
one
of
his
successors
stephen
vi
was
dressed
out
in
the
full
robes
of
office
and
placed
in
the
papal
chair
and
then
the
dead
pope
was
tried
and
condemned
for
some
offence
against
the
laws
of
the
church
it
was
declared
that
the
clergy
whom
he
had
ordained
were
not
to
be
reckoned
as
clergy
his
corpse
was
stripped
of
the
papal
robes
the
fingers
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
raise
in
blessing
were
cut
off
and
the
body
after
having
been
dragged
about
the
city
was
thrown
into
the
tiber
otho
the
great
who
has
been
mentioned
as
emperor
turned
out
a
young
pope
john
who
was
charged
with
all
sorts
of
bad
conduct
and
that
emperor
grandson
otho
put
in
two
popes
one
after
another
the
second
of
these
popes
was
a
very
learned
and
clever
frenchman
named
gerbert
who
as
pope
took
the
name
of
sylvester
ii
he
had
studied
under
the
arabs
in
spain
for
in
some
kinds
of
learning
the
arabs
were
then
far
beyond
the
christians
and
it
was
he
who
first
taught
christians
to
use
the
arabic
figures
such
as
and
instead
of
the
roman
letters
or
figures
such
as
and
he
also
made
a
famous
clock
and
on
account
of
his
skill
in
such
things
people
supposed
him
to
be
a
sorcerer
and
told
strange
stories
about
him
thus
it
is
said
that
he
made
a
brazen
head
which
answered
yes
and
no
to
questions
gerbert
asked
his
head
where
he
should
die
and
supposed
from
the
answer
that
it
was
to
be
in
the
city
of
jerusalem
but
one
day
as
he
was
at
service
in
one
of
the
roman
churches
which
is
called
holy
cross
in
jerusalem
he
was
taken
very
ill
and
then
he
understood
that
that
church
was
the
jerusalem
in
which
he
was
to
die
we
need
not
believe
such
stories
but
yet
it
is
well
to
know
about
them
because
they
show
what
people
were
disposed
to
believe
in
the
time
when
the
stories
were
made
the
troubles
of
the
papacy
continued
and
at
one
time
there
were
no
fewer
than
three
popes
each
of
whom
had
one
of
the
three
chief
churches
of
rome
and
gave
himself
out
for
the
only
true
pope
but
this
state
of
things
was
such
a
scandal
that
the
emperor
henry
was
invited
from
germany
to
put
an
end
to
it
and
for
this
purpose
he
held
a
council
at
sutri
not
far
from
rome
in
two
of
the
popes
were
set
aside
and
the
third
gregory
who
was
the
best
of
the
three
was
drawn
to
confess
that
he
had
given
money
to
get
his
office
because
he
wished
to
use
the
power
of
the
papacy
to
bring
about
some
kind
of
reform
but
on
this
he
was
told
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
simony
a
sin
which
takes
its
name
from
simon
the
sorcerer
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
ch
viii
and
which
means
the
buying
of
spiritual
things
with
money
this
had
never
struck
gregory
before
but
when
told
of
it
by
the
council
he
had
no
choice
but
to
lay
aside
his
papal
robes
and
the
emperor
put
one
of
his
own
german
bishops
into
the
papacy
chapter
vii
missions
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
it
will
be
pleasanter
to
tell
you
something
about
the
missions
of
those
times
for
a
great
deal
of
missionary
work
was
then
carried
on
the
bulgarians
who
had
come
from
asia
in
the
end
of
the
seventh
century
and
had
settled
in
the
country
which
still
takes
its
name
from
them
were
converted
by
missionaries
of
the
greek
church
it
is
said
that
when
some
beginning
of
the
work
had
been
made
and
the
king
himself
had
been
baptized
by
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
the
king
asked
the
greek
emperor
to
send
him
a
painter
to
adorn
the
walls
of
his
palace
and
that
a
monk
named
methodius
was
sent
accordingly
for
in
those
times
monks
were
the
only
persons
who
practised
such
arts
as
painting
the
king
desired
him
to
paint
a
hall
in
the
palace
with
subjects
of
a
terrible
kind
by
which
he
meant
that
the
pictures
should
be
taken
from
the
perils
of
hunting
but
instead
of
such
subjects
methodius
painted
the
last
judgment
as
being
the
most
terrible
of
all
things
and
the
king
on
seeing
the
picture
of
hell
with
its
torments
and
being
told
that
such
would
be
the
future
place
of
the
heathen
was
so
terrified
that
he
gave
up
the
idols
which
he
had
kept
until
then
and
that
many
of
his
subjects
were
also
moved
to
seek
admission
into
the
church
although
the
conversion
of
bulgaria
had
been
the
work
of
greek
missionaries
the
popes
afterwards
sent
some
of
their
clergy
into
the
country
and
claimed
it
as
belonging
to
them
and
this
was
one
of
the
chief
causes
why
the
greek
and
the
latin
churches
separated
from
each
other
so
that
they
have
never
since
been
really
reconciled
it
is
not
certain
whether
the
painter
methodius
was
the
same
with
a
monk
of
that
name
who
with
his
brother
named
cyril
brought
about
the
conversion
of
moravia
these
missionaries
went
about
their
work
in
a
different
way
from
what
was
common
for
it
had
been
usual
for
the
greek
clergy
to
use
the
greek
language
and
for
the
western
clergy
to
use
the
latin
in
their
and
in
other
things
relating
to
religion
but
instead
of
this
cyril
and
methodius
learnt
the
language
of
the
country
and
translated
the
with
parts
of
the
holy
scriptures
into
it
so
that
all
might
be
understood
by
the
natives
in
moravia
too
there
was
a
quarrel
between
the
greek
and
the
latin
clergy
but
although
the
popes
usually
insisted
that
the
services
of
the
church
should
be
either
in
latin
or
in
greek
because
these
were
two
of
the
languages
which
were
written
over
the
saviour
cross
they
were
so
much
pleased
with
the
success
of
cyril
and
methodius
that
they
allowed
the
service
of
the
moravian
church
to
be
still
in
the
language
of
the
country
soon
after
the
conversion
of
the
moravians
the
duke
of
bohemia
paid
a
visit
to
their
king
swatopluk
who
received
him
with
great
honour
but
at
dinner
set
him
and
his
followers
to
sit
on
the
floor
as
being
heathens
methodius
who
was
at
the
king
table
spoke
to
the
duke
and
said
that
he
was
sorry
to
see
so
great
a
prince
obliged
to
feed
as
if
he
were
a
swineherd
what
should
i
gain
by
becoming
a
christian
he
replied
and
when
methodius
told
him
that
the
change
would
raise
him
above
all
kings
and
princes
he
and
his
thirty
followers
were
baptized
a
story
of
the
same
kind
is
told
as
to
the
conversion
of
the
carinthians
which
was
brought
about
in
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
by
a
missionary
named
ingo
who
asked
christian
slaves
to
eat
at
his
own
table
while
he
caused
food
to
be
set
outside
the
door
for
their
heathen
masters
as
if
they
had
been
dogs
this
led
the
carinthian
nobles
to
ask
questions
and
in
consequence
of
what
they
heard
they
were
baptized
and
their
example
was
followed
by
their
people
generally
the
second
bishop
of
prague
the
chief
city
of
bohemia
adalbert
is
famous
as
having
gone
on
a
mission
to
the
heathens
of
prussia
by
whom
he
was
martyred
on
the
shore
of
the
frische
haff
in
in
the
north
of
germany
in
denmark
and
in
sweden
anskar
who
had
been
a
monk
at
corbey
on
the
weser
laboured
for
years
with
earnest
devotion
and
with
great
success
in
addition
to
preaching
the
gospel
of
salvation
he
did
much
in
such
charitable
works
as
the
building
of
hospitals
and
the
redemption
of
captives
and
he
persuaded
the
chief
men
of
the
country
north
of
the
elbe
to
give
up
their
trade
in
slaves
which
had
been
a
source
of
great
profit
to
them
but
which
anskar
taught
them
to
regard
as
contrary
to
the
christian
religion
anskar
was
made
archbishop
of
hamburg
and
bremen
and
is
styled
the
apostle
of
the
north
but
he
had
to
suffer
many
dangers
and
reverses
in
his
endeavours
to
do
good
at
one
time
when
hamburg
was
burnt
by
the
northmen
he
lost
his
church
his
monastery
his
library
and
other
property
but
he
only
said
with
the
patriarch
job
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
then
he
set
to
work
again
without
being
discouraged
by
what
had
befallen
him
and
he
even
made
a
friend
of
the
heathen
king
who
had
led
the
attack
on
hamburg
anskar
died
in
the
year
it
is
told
that
when
some
of
his
friends
were
talking
of
miracles
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
done
he
said
if
i
were
worthy
in
my
lord
sight
i
would
ask
of
him
to
grant
me
one
miracle
that
he
would
make
me
a
good
man
the
russians
were
visited
by
missionaries
from
greece
from
rome
and
from
germany
so
that
for
a
time
they
wavered
between
the
different
forms
of
the
christian
religion
which
were
offered
to
them
but
at
length
they
decided
for
the
greek
church
when
their
great
prince
who
at
his
baptism
took
the
name
of
basil
had
been
converted
he
ordered
that
the
idol
of
the
chief
god
who
had
been
worshipped
by
the
russians
should
be
dragged
at
a
horse
tail
through
the
streets
of
the
capital
kieff
and
should
be
thrown
into
the
river
dnieper
many
of
the
people
burst
into
tears
at
the
sight
but
when
they
were
told
that
the
prince
wished
them
to
be
baptized
they
said
that
a
change
of
religion
must
be
good
if
their
prince
recommended
it
and
they
were
baptized
in
great
numbers
some
we
are
told
stood
in
the
water
up
to
their
necks
others
up
to
their
breasts
holding
their
young
children
in
their
arms
and
the
priests
read
the
prayers
from
the
bank
of
the
river
naming
at
once
whole
companies
by
the
same
name
i
might
give
an
account
of
the
spreading
of
the
gospel
in
poland
hungary
and
other
countries
but
let
us
keep
ourselves
to
the
north
of
europe
although
anskar
had
given
up
his
whole
life
to
missionary
work
among
the
nations
near
the
baltic
sea
there
was
still
much
to
be
done
and
sometimes
conversion
was
carried
on
in
ways
which
to
us
seem
very
strange
as
an
instance
of
this
i
may
give
some
account
of
a
norwegian
king
named
olave
the
son
of
tryggve
olave
was
at
first
a
heathen
and
had
long
been
a
famous
when
he
was
converted
and
baptized
in
one
of
the
scilly
islands
he
took
up
his
new
religion
with
a
great
desire
to
spread
it
among
his
people
and
he
went
about
from
one
part
of
norway
to
another
everywhere
destroying
temples
and
idols
and
requiring
the
people
to
be
baptized
whether
they
were
willing
or
not
at
one
place
he
found
eighty
heathens
who
were
supposed
to
be
wizards
he
first
tried
to
convert
them
in
the
morning
when
they
were
sober
and
again
in
the
evening
when
they
were
enjoying
themselves
over
their
horns
of
ale
and
as
he
could
not
persuade
them
whether
they
were
sober
or
drunk
he
burnt
their
temple
over
their
heads
all
the
eighty
perished
except
one
who
made
his
escape
and
this
man
afterwards
fell
into
the
king
hands
and
was
thrown
into
the
sea
at
another
time
olave
fell
in
with
a
young
man
named
endrid
who
agreed
to
become
a
christian
if
any
one
whom
the
king
might
appoint
should
beat
him
in
diving
in
archery
and
in
olave
himself
undertook
the
match
and
got
the
better
of
endrid
in
all
the
trials
and
then
endrid
gave
in
and
allowed
himself
to
be
converted
and
baptized
these
were
strange
ways
of
spreading
the
gospel
but
they
seem
to
have
had
their
effect
on
the
rough
men
of
the
north
at
last
olave
was
attacked
by
some
of
his
heathen
neighbours
and
was
beaten
in
a
great
it
was
generally
believed
that
he
had
perished
in
the
sea
but
there
is
a
story
of
a
norwegian
pilgrim
who
nearly
fifty
years
later
lost
his
way
among
the
sands
of
egypt
and
lighted
on
a
lonely
monastery
with
an
old
man
of
his
own
country
as
its
abbot
the
abbot
put
many
questions
to
him
and
asked
him
to
carry
home
a
girdle
and
a
sword
and
to
give
them
with
a
message
to
a
warrior
who
had
fought
bravely
beside
king
olave
in
his
last
battle
and
on
receiving
them
the
old
warrior
was
assured
that
the
egyptian
abbot
could
be
no
other
than
his
royal
master
who
had
been
so
long
supposed
to
be
dead
somewhat
later
than
olave
the
son
of
tryggve
norway
had
another
king
olave
who
was
very
zealous
for
the
spreading
of
the
gospel
among
his
people
and
like
the
elder
olave
was
willing
to
do
so
by
force
if
he
could
not
manage
the
matter
otherwise
on
his
visiting
a
place
called
dalen
a
bishop
named
grimkil
who
accompanied
him
set
forth
the
christian
doctrine
but
the
heathens
answered
that
their
own
god
was
better
than
the
god
of
the
christians
because
he
could
be
seen
the
king
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
prayer
and
next
morning
at
daybreak
the
idol
of
the
northern
god
thor
was
brought
forward
by
his
worshippers
olave
pointed
to
the
rising
sun
as
being
a
witness
to
the
glory
of
its
maker
and
while
the
heathens
were
gazing
on
its
brightness
a
tall
soldier
to
whom
the
king
had
given
his
orders
beforehand
lifted
up
his
club
and
dashed
the
idol
to
pieces
a
swarm
of
loathsome
creatures
which
had
lived
within
the
idol
huge
body
and
had
fattened
on
the
food
and
drink
which
were
offered
to
it
rushed
forth
as
in
the
case
of
the
image
of
serapis
hundreds
of
years
before
whereupon
the
men
of
dalen
were
convinced
of
the
falsehood
of
their
old
religion
and
consented
to
be
baptized
king
olave
was
at
length
killed
in
battle
against
his
heathen
subjects
and
his
memory
is
regarded
as
that
of
a
saint

from
norway
the
gospel
made
its
way
to
the
norwegian
settlements
in
iceland
and
even
in
greenland
where
it
long
flourished
until
in
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
ice
gathered
on
the
shores
so
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
land
on
them
about
the
same
time
a
great
plague
which
was
called
the
black
death
carried
off
a
large
part
of
the
settlers
and
the
rest
were
so
few
and
so
weak
that
they
were
easily
killed
by
the
natives
it
seems
to
be
certain
that
some
of
the
norwegians
from
greenland
discovered
a
part
of
the
american
continent

no
traces
of
them
remained
there

country
was

chapter
viii
pope
gregory
the
seventh
part
i
in
the
times
of
which
i
have
been
lately
speaking
the
power
of
the
popes
had
grown
far
beyond
what
it
was
in
the
days
of
gregory
the
great
i
have
told
you
gregory
was
very
much
displeased
because
a
patriarch
of
constantinople
had
styled
himself
but
since
that
time
the
popes
had
taken
to
calling
themselves
by
this
very
title
and
they
meant
a
great
deal
more
by
it
than
the
patriarchs
of
constantinople
had
meant
for
people
in
the
east
are
fond
of
big
words
so
that
when
a
patriarch
called
himself
he
did
not
mean
anything
in
particular
but
merely
to
give
himself
a
title
which
would
sound
grandly
and
thus
although
he
claimed
to
be
universal
he
would
have
allowed
the
bishops
of
rome
to
be
universal
too
but
when
the
popes
called
themselves
they
meant
that
they
were
bishops
of
the
whole
church
and
that
all
other
bishops
were
under
them
part
they
had
friends
too
who
were
ready
to
say
anything
to
raise
their
power
and
greatness
thus
about
the
year
when
the
popes
had
begun
to
get
some
land
of
their
own
through
the
gifts
of
pipin
and
charlemagne
a
story
was
got
up
that
the
first
christian
emperor
constantine
when
he
built
his
city
of
constantinople
and
went
to
live
in
the
east
made
over
rome
to
the
pope
and
gave
him
also
all
italy
with
other
countries
of
the
west
and
the
right
of
wearing
a
golden
crown
and
this
story
of
constantine
gift
or
as
it
was
called
although
it
was
quite
false
was
commonly
believed
in
those
days
of
ignorance
see
about
fifty
years
later
another
monstrous
falsehood
was
put
forth
which
helped
the
popes
greatly
somebody
who
took
the
name
of
isidore
a
famous
spanish
bishop
who
had
been
dead
more
than
two
hundred
years
made
a
collection
of
church
law
and
of
popes
letters
and
he
mixed
up
with
the
true
letters
a
quantity
which
he
had
himself
forged
but
which
pretended
to
have
been
written
by
bishops
of
rome
from
the
very
time
of
the
apostles
and
in
these
letters
it
was
made
to
appear
that
the
pope
had
been
appointed
by
our
lord
himself
to
be
head
of
the
whole
church
and
to
govern
it
as
he
liked
and
that
the
popes
had
always
used
this
power
from
the
beginning
this
collection
of
laws
is
known
by
the
name
of
the
but
nobody
in
those
times
had
any
notion
that
they
were
false
and
so
they
were
believed
by
every
one
and
the
pope
got
all
that
they
claimed
for
him
but
in
course
of
time
the
popes
would
not
be
contented
even
with
this
in
former
ages
nobody
could
be
made
pope
without
the
emperor
consent
and
we
have
seen
how
otho
the
great
his
grandson
otho
and
afterwards
henry
had
thought
that
they
might
call
popes
to
account
for
their
conduct
how
these
emperors
brought
some
popes
before
councils
for
trial
and
turned
them
out
of
their
office
when
they
misbehaved
but
just
after
henry
as
we
have
read
had
got
rid
of
three
popes
at
once
a
great
change
began
which
was
meant
to
set
the
popes
above
the
emperors
the
chief
mover
in
this
change
was
hildebrand
who
is
said
to
have
been
the
son
of
a
carpenter
in
a
little
tuscan
town
and
was
born
between
the
years
and
pp
part
ii
hildebrand
became
a
monk
of
the
strictest
kind
and
soon
showed
a
wonderful
power
of
swaying
the
minds
of
other
men
thus
when
a
german
named
bruno
bishop
of
toul
had
been
chosen
as
pope
by
henry
to
whom
he
was
related
and
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
rome
that
he
might
take
possession
of
his
office
his
thoughts
were
entirely
changed
by
some
talk
with
hildebrand
whom
he
happened
to
meet
hildebrand
told
him
that
popes
instead
of
being
appointed
by
emperors
ought
to
be
freely
chosen
by
the
roman
clergy
and
people
and
thereupon
bruno
putting
off
his
fine
robes
went
on
to
rome
in
company
with
hildebrand
whose
lessons
he
listened
to
all
the
way
so
that
he
took
up
the
monk
notions
as
to
all
matters
which
concerned
the
church
on
arriving
at
rome
he
told
the
romans
that
he
did
not
consider
himself
to
be
pope
on
account
of
the
emperor
favour
but
that
if
they
should
think
fit
to
choose
him
he
was
willing
to
be
pope
on
this
he
was
elected
by
them
with
great
joy
and
took
the
name
of
leo
ix
but
although
leo
was
called
pope
it
was
hildebrand
who
really
took
the
management
of
everything
when
leo
died
the
romans
wished
to
put
hildebrand
into
his
place
but
he
did
not
yet
feel
himself
ready
to
take
the
papacy
and
instead
of
this
he
contrived
to
get
one
after
another
of
his
party
elected
until
at
length
after
having
really
directed
everything
for
no
less
than
years
and
under
the
names
of
five
popes
in
succession
he
allowed
himself
to
be
chosen
in
and
styled
himself
gregory
vii
the
empire
was
then
in
a
very
sad
state
henry
iii
had
died
in
leaving
a
boy
less
than
six
years
old
to
succeed
him
and
this
poor
boy
who
became
henry
was
very
badly
used
by
those
who
were
about
him
one
day
as
he
was
on
an
island
in
the
river
rhine
hanno
archbishop
of
cologne
gave
him
such
an
account
of
a
beautiful
new
boat
which
had
been
built
for
the
archbishop
that
the
young
prince
naturally
wished
to
see
it
and
as
soon
as
he
was
safe
on
board
hanno
carried
him
off
to
cologne
away
from
his
mother
the
empress
agnes
thus
the
poor
young
henry
was
in
the
hands
of
people
who
meant
no
good
by
him
and
although
he
was
naturally
a
bright
clever
amiable
lad
they
did
what
they
could
to
spoil
him
and
to
make
him
unfit
for
his
office
by
educating
him
badly
and
by
throwing
in
his
way
temptations
to
which
he
was
only
too
ready
to
yield
and
when
they
had
done
this
and
he
had
made
himself
hated
by
many
of
his
people
on
account
of
his
misbehaviour
the
very
persons
who
had
done
the
most
to
cause
his
faults
took
advantage
of
them
and
tried
to
get
rid
of
him
as
king
of
germany
and
emperor
in
the
meantime
hildebrand
or
gregory
as
we
must
now
call
him
and
his
friends
had
been
well
pleased
to
look
on
the
troubles
of
germany
for
they
hoped
to
turn
the
discontent
of
the
germans
to
their
own
purpose
gregory
had
higher
notions
as
to
the
papacy
than
any
one
who
had
gone
before
him
he
thought
that
all
power
of
every
kind
belonged
to
the
pope
that
kings
had
their
authority
from
him
that
all
kingdoms
were
held
under
him
as
the
chief
lord
that
popes
were
as
much
greater
than
kings
or
emperors
as
the
sun
is
greater
than
the
moon
that
popes
could
make
or
unmake
kings
just
as
they
pleased
and
although
he
had
asked
the
emperor
to
confirm
his
election
as
had
been
usual
he
was
resolved
that
such
a
thing
should
never
again
be
asked
of
an
emperor
by
any
pope
in
the
time
to
come
part
iii
one
way
in
which
gregory
tried
to
increase
his
power
was
by
forcing
the
clergy
to
live
unmarried
or
if
they
were
married
already
to
put
away
their
wives
this
was
a
thing
which
had
not
been
required
either
in
the
new
testament
or
by
the
church
in
early
times
but
by
degrees
a
notion
had
grown
up
that
single
life
was
holier
than
married
life
and
many
canons
or
laws
of
the
church
had
been
made
against
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
but
gregory
carried
this
further
than
any
one
before
him
because
he
saw
that
to
make
the
clergy
different
from
other
men
and
to
cut
them
off
from
wife
and
children
and
the
usual
connexions
of
family
was
a
way
to
unite
them
more
closely
into
a
body
by
themselves
he
saw
that
it
would
bind
them
more
firmly
to
rome
that
it
would
teach
them
to
look
to
the
pope
rather
than
to
their
national
sovereign
as
their
chief
and
that
he
might
count
on
such
clergy
as
sure
tools
ready
to
be
at
the
pope
service
in
any
quarrel
with
princes
he
therefore
sent
out
his
orders
forbidding
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
and
he
set
the
people
against
their
spiritual
pastors
by
telling
them
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
married
clergy
and
not
to
receive
the
sacraments
of
the
church
from
them
the
effects
of
these
commands
were
terrible
the
married
clergy
were
insulted
in
all
possible
ways
many
of
them
were
driven
by
violence
from
their
parishes
and
their
unfortunate
wives
were
made
objects
of
scorn
for
all
mankind
so
great
and
scandalous
were
the
disorders
which
arose
that
many
persons
in
disgust
at
the
evils
which
distracted
the
church
and
at
the
fury
with
which
parties
fought
within
it
forsook
it
and
joined
some
of
the
sects
which
were
always
on
the
outlook
for
converts
from
it
another
thing
on
which
gregory
set
his
heart
as
a
means
of
increasing
the
power
of
the
popes
was
to
do
away
with
what
was
called
this
was
the
name
of
the
form
by
which
princes
gave
bishops
possession
of
the
estates
and
other
property
belonging
to
their
sees
the
custom
had
been
that
princes
should
put
the
pastoral
staff
into
the
hands
of
a
new
bishop
and
should
place
a
ring
on
one
of
his
fingers
but
now
fault
was
found
with
these
acts
because
the
staff
meant
that
the
bishop
had
the
charge
of
his
people
as
a
shepherd
has
of
his
flock
and
the
ring
meant
that
he
was
joined
to
his
church
as
a
husband
is
joined
to
his
wife
in
marriage
for
now
it
was
said
to
be
wrong
to
use
things
which
are
signs
of
spiritual
power
when
that
which
the
prince
gives
is
not
spiritual
power
but
only
a
right
to
the
earthly
possessions
of
the
see
gregory
therefore
ordered
that
no
bishop
should
take
investiture
from
any
sovereign
and
that
no
sovereign
should
give
investiture
and
out
of
this
grew
a
quarrel
which
lasted
fifty
years
and
was
the
cause
of
grievous
troubles
in
the
church
gregory
had
also
quarrels
with
enemies
at
home
one
of
these
a
rough
and
lawless
man
named
cencius
went
so
far
as
to
seize
him
when
he
was
at
a
service
about
midnight
on
christmas
eve
and
carried
him
off
to
a
tower
where
the
pope
was
exposed
all
night
to
the
insults
of
a
gang
of
ruffians
and
of
cencius
himself
who
even
held
a
sword
to
his
naked
throat
in
the
hope
of
frightening
him
into
the
payment
of
a
large
sum
as
ransom
but
gregory
was
not
a
man
to
be
terrified
by
any
violence
and
held
out
firmly
a
woman
who
took
pity
on
him
bathed
his
wounds
and
a
man
gave
him
some
furs
to
protect
him
against
the
cold
and
in
the
morning
he
was
delivered
by
a
party
of
his
friends
by
whom
cencius
and
his
ruffians
were
overpowered
and
frightened
into
giving
up
their
prisoner
part
iv
in
germany
many
of
the
princes
and
people
threw
off
their
obedience
to
henry
they
destroyed
his
castles
and
reduced
him
to
great
distress
they
held
meetings
against
him
and
were
strong
enough
to
make
him
give
up
his
power
of
government
for
a
time
and
leave
all
questions
between
him
and
his
subjects
to
be
settled
by
the
pope
henry
was
so
much
afraid
of
losing
his
kingdom
altogether
that
in
order
to
beg
the
mercy
he
crossed
the
alps
with
his
queen
and
a
few
others
in
the
midst
of
a
very
hard
winter
running
great
risks
among
the
snow
and
ice
which
covered
the
lofty
mountains
over
which
his
road
lay
in
the
hope
of
getting
the
pope
forgiveness
he
hastened
to
canossa
a
castle
among
the
apennines
at
which
gregory
then
was
but
gregory
kept
the
emperor
standing
three
days
outside
the
gate
dressed
as
a
penitent
and
pierced
through
and
through
by
the
bitter
cold
of
that
terrible
winter
before
he
would
allow
himself
to
be
seen
when
at
last
henry
was
admitted
the
pope
treated
him
very
hardly
some
say
that
he
even
tried
to
make
him
take
the
holy
sacrament
of
our
lord
body
by
way
of
proving
whether
he
were
innocent
or
guilty
of
the
charges
which
his
enemies
brought
against
him
and
after
all
that
henry
had
gone
through
no
peace
was
made
between
him
and
his
enemies
the
troubles
of
germany
continued
the
other
party
set
up
against
henry
a
king
of
their
own
choosing
named
rudolf
and
henry
in
return
for
this
set
up
another
pope
in
opposition
to
gregory
after
a
time
henry
was
able
to
put
down
his
enemies
in
germany
and
he
led
a
large
army
into
italy
where
he
got
almost
all
rome
into
his
hands
and
on
easter
day
he
was
crowned
as
emperor
in
peter
church
by
clement
the
pope
of
his
party
gregory
entreated
the
help
of
robert
guiscard
the
chief
of
some
normans
who
had
got
possession
of
the
south
of
italy
and
guiscard
who
was
glad
to
have
such
an
opportunity
for
interfering
speedily
came
to
his
relief
and
delivered
him
but
in
fighting
with
the
romans
in
the
streets
these
normans
set
the
city
on
fire
and
a
great
part
of
it
was
destroyed
so
that
within
the
walls
of
rome
there
are
even
in
our
own
day
large
spaces
which
were
once
covered
with
buildings
but
are
now
given
up
to
cornfields
or
vineyards
gregory
felt
himself
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
his
ruined
city
and
when
the
normans
withdrew
he
went
with
them
to
salerno
where
he
died
on
the
of
may
it
is
said
that
his
last
words
were
i
have
loved
righteousness
and
hated
iniquity
therefore
i
die
in
exile
and
the
meaning
seems
to
be
that
by
these
words
he
wished
to
claim
the
benefit
of
our
lord
saying
blessed
are
they
which
are
persecuted
for
righteousness
sake
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
of
all
the
popes
gregory
vii
was
the
one
who
did
most
to
increase
the
power
of
the
papacy
no
doubt
he
was
honest
in
his
intentions
and
thought
that
to
carry
them
out
would
be
the
best
thing
for
the
whole
church
as
well
as
for
the
bishops
of
rome
but
he
did
not
care
whether
the
means
which
he
used
were
fair
or
foul
and
if
his
plans
had
succeeded
they
would
have
brought
all
mankind
into
slavery
to
rome
chapter
ix
the
first
crusade
part
i
the
popes
who
came
next
after
gregory
vii
carried
things
with
a
high
hand
following
the
example
which
he
had
set
them
they
got
the
better
of
henry
but
in
a
way
which
did
them
no
credit
for
when
henry
had
returned
from
italy
to
his
own
country
and
had
done
his
best
by
many
years
of
good
government
to
heal
the
effects
of
the
long
troubles
of
germany
the
popes
encouraged
his
son
conrad
and
after
conrad
death
his
younger
son
henry
to
rebel
against
him
the
younger
henry
behaved
very
treacherously
to
his
father
whom
he
forced
to
give
up
his
crown
and
at
last
henry
iv
died
in
when
henry
was
thus
out
of
the
way
his
son
henry
who
until
then
had
seemed
to
be
a
tool
of
the
pope
and
the
clergy
showed
what
sort
of
man
he
really
was
by
imprisoning
pope
paschal
ii
and
his
cardinals
for
nine
weeks
until
he
made
the
pope
grant
all
that
he
wanted
but
at
length
this
emperor
was
able
to
settle
for
a
time
the
great
quarrel
of
investitures
by
an
agreement
made
at
the
city
of
worms
on
the
rhine
in
but
before
this
time
and
while
henry
iv
was
still
emperor
the
popes
had
got
a
great
addition
to
their
power
and
importance
by
the
a
word
which
means
wars
undertaken
for
the
sake
of
the
cross
i
have
told
you
already
how
from
the
fourth
century
it
became
the
fashion
for
christians
to
flock
from
all
countries
into
the
holy
land
that
they
might
warm
their
faith
as
they
thought
by
the
sight
of
the
places
where
our
blessed
lord
had
been
born
and
lived
and
died
and
where
most
of
the
other
things
written
in
the
scripture
history
had
taken
place
very
often
indeed
this
pilgrimage
was
found
to
do
more
harm
than
good
to
those
who
went
on
it
for
many
of
them
had
their
minds
taken
up
with
anything
rather
than
the
pious
thoughts
which
they
professed
but
the
fashion
of
pilgrimage
grew
more
and
more
whether
the
pilgrims
were
the
better
or
the
worse
for
it
part
when
the
holy
land
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
mahometans
as
i
have
mentioned
these
often
treated
the
christian
pilgrims
very
badly
behaving
cruelly
to
them
insulting
them
and
making
them
pay
enormously
for
leave
to
visit
the
holy
places
and
when
palestine
was
conquered
by
the
turks
who
had
taken
up
the
mahometan
religion
lately
and
were
full
of
their
new
zeal
for
it
the
condition
of
the
christians
there
became
worse
than
ever
there
had
often
been
thoughts
among
the
christians
of
the
west
as
to
making
an
attempt
to
get
back
the
holy
land
from
the
unbelievers
but
now
the
matter
was
to
be
taken
up
with
a
zeal
which
had
never
before
been
felt
page
a
pilgrim
from
the
north
of
france
called
peter
the
hermit
on
returning
from
jerusalem
carried
to
pope
urban
ii
a
fearful
tale
of
the
tyranny
with
which
the
mahometans
there
treated
both
the
christian
inhabitants
and
the
pilgrims
and
the
pope
gave
him
leave
to
try
what
he
could
do
to
stir
up
the
christians
of
the
west
for
the
deliverance
of
their
brethren
peter
was
a
small
lean
dark
man
but
with
an
eye
of
fire
and
with
a
power
of
fiery
speech
and
wherever
he
went
he
found
that
people
of
all
classes
eagerly
thronged
to
hear
him
they
even
gathered
up
the
hairs
which
fell
from
the
mule
on
which
he
rode
and
treasured
them
up
as
precious
relics
on
his
bringing
back
to
the
pope
a
report
of
the
success
which
he
had
thus
far
met

resolved
to
proclaim
the
crusade
and
went
into
france
as
being
the
country
where
it
was
most
likely
to
be
welcomed
there
in
a
great
meeting
at
clermont
where
such
vast
numbers
attended
that
most
of
them
were
forced
to
lodge
in
tents
because
the
town
itself
could
not
hold
them
the
pope
in
stirring
words
set
forth
the
reasons
of
the
holy
war
and
invited
his
hearers
to
take
part
in
it
while
he
was
speaking
the
people
broke
in
on
him
with
shouts
of
god
wills
it
words
which
from
that
time
became
the
cry
of
the
crusaders
and
when
he
had
done
thousands
enlisted
for
the
crusade
by
fixing
little
crosses
on
their
dress
all
over
europe
everything
was
set
into
motion
almost
every
one
whether
old
or
young
strong
or
feeble
was
eager
to
join
women
urged
their
husbands
or
their
sons
to
take
the
cross
and
any
one
who
refused
was
despised
by
all
many
of
those
who
enlisted
would
not
wait
for
the
time
which
had
been
fixed
for
starting
a
large
body
set
out
under
peter
the
hermit
and
two
knights
of
whom
one
was
called
walter
the
pennyless
other
crowds
followed
which
were
made
up
not
of
fighting
men
only
but
of
poor
old
men
of
women
and
children
who
had
no
notion
how
very
far
off
jerusalem
was
or
what
dangers
lay
in
the
way
to
it
there
were
many
simple
country
folks
who
set
out
with
their
families
in
carts
drawn
by
oxen
and
whenever
they
came
to
any
town
their
children
asked
is
this
jerusalem
and
besides
these
poor
creatures
there
were
many
bad
people
who
plundered
as
they
went
on
so
as
to
make
the
crusade
hated
even
by
the
christian
inhabitants
of
the
countries
through
which
they
passed
these
first
swarms
took
the
way
through
hungary
to
constantinople
and
then
across
the
bosphorus
into
asia
minor
walter
the
pennyless
who
although
his
pockets
were
empty
seems
to
have
been
a
brave
and
good
soldier
was
killed
in
battle
near
nicæa
the
place
where
the
first
general
council
had
been
held
but
which
had
now
become
the
capital
of
the
turks
and
the
bones
of
his
followers
who
fell
with
him
were
gathered
into
a
great
heap
which
stood
as
a
monument
of
their
rashness
it
is
said
that
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
human
beings
had
already
perished
in
these
attempts
before
the
main
forces
of
the
crusaders
began
to
move
part
part
ii
when
the
regular
armies
started
at
length
part
of
them
marched
through
hungary
while
others
went
through
italy
and
there
took
ship
for
constantinople
the
chief
of
their
leaders
was
godfrey
of
bouillon
a
brave
and
pious
knight
and
among
the
other
commanders
was
robert
duke
of
normandy
whom
we
read
of
in
english
history
as
the
eldest
son
of
william
the
conqueror
and
brother
of
william
rufus
when
they
reached
constantinople
they
found
that
the
greek
emperor
alexius
looked
on
them
with
distrust
and
dislike
rather
than
with
kindness
and
he
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
by
helping
them
across
the
strait
to
asia
in
passing
through
asia
minor
the
crusaders
had
to
fight
often
and
to
struggle
with
many
other
difficulties
the
sight
of
the
hill
of
bones
near
nicæa
roused
them
to
fury
and
in
order
to
avenge
walter
the
pennyless
and
his
companions
they
laid
siege
to
the
city
which
they
took
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
after
resting
there
for
a
time
they
went
on
again
and
reached
antioch
which
they
besieged
for
eight
months
during
this
siege
they
suffered
terribly
their
tents
were
blown
to
shreds
by
the
winds
or
were
rotted
by
the
heavy
rains
which
turned
the
ground
into
a
swamp
and
as
they
had
wasted
their
provisions
in
the
beginning
of
the
siege
not
expecting
that
it
would
last
so
long
they
found
themselves
in
great
distress
for
food
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
eat
the
flesh
of
horses
and
camels
of
dogs
and
mice
with
grass
and
thistles
leather
and
the
bark
of
trees
their
horses
had
almost
all
sunk
under
the
hardships
of
the
siege
and
the
men
were
thinned
by
disease
and
by
the
assaults
of
their
enemies
at
length
antioch
was
betrayed
to
them
but
they
made
a
bad
use
of
their
success
they
slew
all
of
the
inhabitants
who
refused
to
become
christians
they
wasted
the
provisions
which
they
found
in
the
city
or
which
were
brought
to
them
from
other
quarters
and
when
a
fresh
mahometan
force
appeared
which
was
vastly
greater
than
their
own
they
found
themselves
shut
in
between
it
and
the
garrison
of
the
castle
which
they
had
not
been
able
to
take
when
they
took
the
city
their
distress
was
now
greater
than
before
and
their
case
seemed
to
be
almost
hopeless
when
their
spirits
were
revived
by
the
discovery
of
something
which
was
supposed
to
be
the
lance
by
which
our
blessed
side
was
pierced
on
the
cross
they
rushed
with
full
confidence
to
attack
the
enemy
on
the
outside
and
the
victory
which
they
gained
over
these
was
soon
followed
by
the
surrender
of
the
castle
but
a
plague
which
broke
out
among
them
obliged
them
to
remain
nearly
nine
months
longer
at
antioch
having
recruited
their
health
they
moved
on
towards
jerusalem
although
their
numbers
were
now
much
less
than
when
they
had
reached
antioch
when
at
length
they
came
in
sight
of
the
holy
city
a
cry
of
jerusalem
jerusalem
god
wills
it
ran
through
the
army
although
many
were
so
moved
that
they
were
unable
to
speak
and
could
only
find
vent
for
their
feelings
in
tears
and
sighs
all
threw
themselves
on
their
knees
and
kissed
the
sacred
ground
june
the
siege
of
jerusalem
lasted
forty
days
during
which
the
crusaders
suffered
much
from
hunger
and
still
more
from
thirst
for
it
was
the
height
of
summer
when
all
the
brooks
of
that
hot
country
are
dried
up
the
wells
about
which
we
read
so
much
in
holy
scripture
were
purposely
choked
with
rubbish
and
the
cisterns
were
destroyed
or
poisoned
water
had
to
be
fetched
from
a
distance
of
six
miles
and
was
sold
very
dear
but
it
was
so
filthy
that
many
died
after
drinking
it
the
besiegers
found
much
difficulty
in
getting
wood
to
make
the
engines
which
were
then
used
in
attacking
the
walls
of
cities
and
when
they
had
at
length
been
able
to
build
such
machines
as
they
wanted
the
defenders
tried
to
upset
them
and
threw
at
them
showers
of
burning
pitch
or
oil
and
what
was
called
the
greek
fire
in
the
hope
that
they
might
set
the
engines
themselves
in
flames
or
at
least
might
scald
or
wound
the
people
in
them
we
are
even
told
that
two
old
women
who
were
supposed
to
be
witches
were
set
to
utter
spells
and
curses
from
the
walls
but
a
stone
from
an
engine
crushed
the
poor
old
wretches
and
their
bodies
tumbled
down
into
the
ditch
which
surrounded
the
city
the
crusaders
were
driven
back
in
one
assault
and
were
all
but
giving
way
in
the
second
but
godfrey
of
bouillon
thought
that
he
saw
in
the
sky
a
bright
figure
of
a
warrior
beckoning
him
onwards
and
the
crusaders
pressed
forward
with
renewed
courage
until
they
found
themselves
masters
of
the
holy
city
july
it
was
noted
that
this
was
at
three
on
a
friday
afternoon
the
same
day
of
the
week
and
the
same
hour
of
the
day
when
our
blessed
lord
was
crucified
i
shall
not
tell
you
of
the
butchery
and
of
the
other
shocking
things
which
the
crusaders
were
guilty
of
when
they
got
possession
of
jerusalem
they
were
indeed
wrought
up
to
such
a
state
that
they
were
not
masters
of
themselves
at
one
moment
they
were
throwing
themselves
on
their
knees
with
tears
of
repentance
and
joy
and
then
again
they
would
start
up
and
break
lose
into
some
frightful
acts
of
cruelty
and
plunder
against
the
conquered
enemy
sparing
neither
old
man
nor
woman
nor
child
part
iii
eight
days
after
the
taking
of
jerusalem
the
crusaders
met
to
choose
a
king
robert
of
normandy
was
one
of
those
who
were
proposed
but
the
choice
fell
on
godfrey
of
bouillon
but
the
pious
godfrey
said
that
he
would
not
wear
a
crown
of
gold
when
the
king
of
kings
had
been
crowned
with
thorns
and
he
refused
to
take
any
higher
title
than
that
of
defender
and
baron
of
the
holy
sepulchre
godfrey
did
not
live
long
to
enjoy
his
honours
and
his
brother
baldwin
was
chosen
in
his
room
the
kingdom
of
jerusalem
was
established
and
pilgrims
soon
began
to
stream
afresh
towards
the
sacred
places
but
although
we
might
have
expected
to
find
that
this
recovery
of
the
holy
land
from
the
mahometans
by
the
christians
of
the
west
would
have
led
to
union
of
the
greek
and
latin
churches
it
unhappily
turned
out
quite
otherwise
the
popes
set
up
a
latin
patriarch
with
latin
bishops
and
clergy
against
the
greeks
and
the
two
churches
were
on
worse
terms
than
ever
this
crusade
was
followed
by
others
as
we
shall
see
by
and
by
but
meanwhile
i
may
say
that
although
the
latin
kingdom
of
jerusalem
was
never
strong
and
soon
showed
signs
of
decay
these
crusades
brought
the
nations
of
the
west
which
fought
side
by
side
in
them
to
know
more
of
each
other
that
they
served
to
increase
trade
with
the
east
and
so
to
bring
the
produce
of
the
eastern
countries
within
the
reach
of
europeans
and
as
i
have
said
already
they
greatly
helped
to
increase
the
power
of
the
popes
who
had
seen
their
way
to
take
the
direction
of
them
and
thus
get
a
stronger
hold
than
before
on
the
princes
and
people
of
western
christendom
page
chapter
x
new
orders
of
military
orders
in
the
times
of
which
i
have
lately
been
speaking
the
monks
did
much
valuable
service
to
the
church
and
to
the
world
in
general
it
was
mostly
through
their
labours
that
heathen
nations
were
converted
to
the
gospel
that
their
barbarous
roughness
was
tamed
and
that
learning
although
it
had
greatly
decayed
was
not
altogether
lost
often
where
monks
had
built
their
houses
in
lonely
places
little
clusters
of
huts
grew
up
round
them
and
in
time
these
clusters
of
huts
became
large
and
important
towns
monks
were
very
highly
thought
of
and
sometimes
it
was
seen
that
kings
and
queens
would
leave
all
their
worldly
grandeur
and
would
withdraw
to
spend
their
last
years
under
the
quiet
roof
of
a
monastery
but
it
was
found
at
the
same
time
that
monks
were
apt
to
fall
away
from
the
strict
rules
by
which
they
were
bound
so
that
reforms
were
continually
needed
among
them
as
the
popes
became
more
powerful
they
found
the
monks
valuable
friends
and
allies
and
they
gave
to
many
monasteries
that
is
to
say
they
took
it
on
themselves
to
set
those
monasteries
free
from
the
control
which
the
bishops
had
held
over
them
so
that
the
monks
of
these
exempt
places
did
not
own
any
bishop
at
all
and
would
not
allow
that
any
one
but
the
pope
was
over
them
i
have
already
told
you
of
the
rule
which
was
drawn
up
for
monks
by
benedict
of
nursia
some
other
rules
were
afterwards
made
such
as
that
of
columban
an
irish
abbot
who
for
many
years
laboured
in
france
switzerland
and
the
north
of
italy
columban
went
more
into
little
matters
than
benedict
had
done
and
laid
down
exact
directions
in
cases
where
benedict
had
left
the
abbots
of
monasteries
to
settle
things
as
they
should
think
fit
thus
columban
rule
laid
down
that
any
monk
who
should
call
anything
his
own
should
receive
six
strokes
and
appointed
the
same
punishment
for
every
one
who
should
omit
to
say
after
the
abbot
blessing
or
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
his
spoon
or
his
candle
for
every
one
who
should
talk
at
meals
or
should
cough
at
the
beginning
of
a
psalm
there
were
ten
strokes
for
striking
the
table
with
a
knife
or
for
spilling
beer
on
it
and
for
heavier
offences
the
punishment
sometimes
rose
as
high
as
two
hundred
besides
that
other
punishments
were
used
such
as
fasting
on
bread
and
water
humble
postures
and
long
times
of
silence
part
still
however
benedict
rule
was
that
by
which
the
greater
part
of
the
western
monks
were
governed
but
although
they
were
under
the
same
rule
they
had
no
other
connexion
with
each
other
each
company
of
monks
stood
by
itself
having
no
tie
outside
its
own
walls
there
was
not
as
yet
in
the
west
anything
like
the
society
which
pachomius
had
long
before
established
in
egypt
where
all
the
monasteries
were
supposed
to
be
as
so
many
sisters
and
all
owned
the
as
their
head
it
was
not
until
the
tenth
century
that
anything
of
this
kind
was
set
on
foot
in
the
western
church
see
part
in
the
year
an
abbot
named
berno
founded
a
new
society
at
cluny
in
burgundy
he
began
with
only
twelve
monks
but
by
degrees
the
fame
of
cluny
spread
and
the
pattern
which
had
been
set
there
was
copied
far
and
wide
until
at
length
more
than
two
thousand
monasteries
were
reckoned
as
belonging
to
the
congregation
as
it
was
called
or
order
of
cluny
and
all
these
looked
up
to
the
great
abbot
of
the
as
their
chief
the
early
abbots
of
cluny
were
very
remarkable
men
and
took
a
great
part
in
the
affairs
both
of
the
church
and
of
kingdoms
some
of
them
even
refused
the
popedom
and
bishops
placed
themselves
under
them
as
simple
monks
of
cluny
for
the
sake
of
their
advice
and
teaching
the
founders
of
the
cluniac
order
added
many
precepts
to
the
rule
of
benedict
thus
the
monks
were
required
to
swallow
all
the
crumbs
of
their
bread
at
the
end
of
every
meal
and
when
some
of
them
showed
a
wish
to
escape
this
duty
they
were
frightened
into
obedience
by
an
awful
tale
that
a
monk
when
dying
saw
at
the
end
of
his
bed
a
great
sack
of
the
crumbs
which
he
had
left
on
the
table
rising
up
as
a
witness
against
him
the
monks
were
bound
to
keep
silence
at
times
and
we
are
told
that
rather
than
break
this
rule
one
of
them
allowed
his
horse
to
be
stolen
and
another
let
himself
be
carried
off
as
a
prisoner
by
the
northmen
during
these
times
of
silence
they
made
use
of
a
set
of
signs
by
which
they
were
able
to
let
each
other
know
what
they
wanted
this
congregation
of
cluny
then
was
the
first
great
monkish
order
in
the
west
and
others
soon
followed
it
they
were
mostly
very
strict
at
first
some
of
them
so
strict
that
they
not
only
forbade
all
luxury
in
the
monks
but
would
not
allow
any
fine
buildings
or
any
handsome
furniture
in
their
churches
but
in
general
the
monks
soon
got
over
this
by
saying
that
as
their
buildings
and
their
services
were
not
for
themselves
but
for
god
their
duty
was
to
honour
him
by
giving
him
of
the
best
that
they
could
these
orders
were
known
from
each
other
by
the
difference
of
their
dress
thus
the
benedictines
were
called
black
monks
the
cistercians
were
called
white
monks
and
at
a
later
time
we
find
mention
of
black
friars
white
friars
grey
friars
and
so
forth
about
the
time
of
gregory
several
new
orders
were
founded
and
of
these
the
most
famous
were
the
carthusians
and
the
cistercians
as
to
the
beginning
of
the
carthusian
order
a
strange
story
is
told
the
founder
bruno
is
said
to
have
been
studying
at
paris
when
a
famous
teacher
who
had
been
greatly
respected
for
his
piety
died
as
his
funeral
was
on
its
way
to
the
grave
the
corpse
suddenly
raised
itself
from
the
bier
and
uttered
the
words
by
god
righteous
judgment
i
am
accused
all
who
were
around
were
struck
with
horror
and
the
burial
was
put
off
until
the
next
day
but
then
as
the
mourners
were
again
moving
towards
the
grave
the
dead
man
rose
up
a
second
time
and
groaned
out
by
god
righteous
judgment
i
am
judged
again
the
service
was
put
off
but
on
the
third
day
the
general
awe
was
raised
to
a
height
by
his
lifting
up
his
head
and
saying
by
god
righteous
judgment
i
am
condemned
and
it
is
said
that
on
this
discovery
as
to
the
real
state
of
a
man
who
had
been
so
highly
honoured
for
his
supposed
goodness
bruno
was
so
struck
by
a
feeling
of
the
hollowness
of
all
earthly
judgment
that
he
resolved
to
hide
himself
in
a
desert
i
have
given
this
story
as
a
sample
of
the
strange
tales
which
have
been
told
and
believed
but
not
a
word
of
it
is
really
true
and
reasons
for
withdrawing
from
the
world
were
of
quite
a
different
kind
it
is
however
true
that
he
did
withdraw
into
a
wild
and
lonely
place
which
is
now
known
as
the
great
chartreuse
among
rough
and
awful
rocks
near
grenoble
and
there
an
extremely
severe
rule
was
laid
down
for
the
monks
of
his
order
they
were
to
wear
goatskins
next
to
the
flesh
and
their
dress
was
altogether
to
be
of
the
coarsest
and
roughest
sort
on
three
days
of
each
week
their
food
was
bread
and
water
on
the
other
days
they
were
allowed
some
vegetables
but
even
their
highest
fare
on
holidays
was
cheese
and
fish
and
they
never
tasted
meat
at
all
once
a
week
they
submitted
to
be
flogged
after
confessing
their
sins
they
spoke
on
sundays
and
festivals
only
and
were
not
allowed
to
use
signs
like
the
cluniacs
it
is
to
be
said
to
the
credit
of
the
carthusians
that
although
their
order
grew
rich
and
built
splendid
monasteries
and
churches
they
always
kept
to
their
hard
way
of
living
more
faithfully
perhaps
than
any
other
order
the
cistercian
order
which
i
have
mentioned
was
founded
by
robert
of
molême
and
took
its
name
from
its
chief
monastery
citeaux
or
in
latin
the
rule
was
very
strict
from
the
middle
of
september
to
easter
they
were
to
eat
but
one
meal
daily
their
monasteries
were
not
to
be
built
in
towns
but
in
lonely
places
they
were
to
shun
pomp
and
pride
in
all
things
their
services
were
to
be
plain
and
simple
without
any
fine
music
their
vestments
and
all
the
furniture
of
their
churches
were
to
be
coarse
and
without
ornament
no
paintings
nor
sculptures
nor
stained
glass
were
allowed
the
ordinary
dress
of
the
monks
was
to
be
white
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
the
hardness
of
the
cistercian
rule
prevented
people
from
joining
but
the
third
abbot
of
citeaux
an
englishman
named
stephen
harding
when
he
was
distressed
at
the
slow
progress
of
the
order
was
comforted
by
a
vision
in
which
he
saw
a
multitude
washing
their
white
robes
in
a
fountain
and
very
soon
the
vision
seemed
to
be
fulfilled
in
bernard
of
whom
we
shall
hear
more
presently
entered
the
monastery
of
citeaux
and
by
and
by
the
order
spread
so
wonderfully
that
it
equalled
the
cluniac
congregation
in
the
number
of
houses
belonging
to
it
these
were
not
only
connected
together
like
the
cluniac
monasteries
but
had
a
new
kind
of
tie
in
the
general
chapters
which
were
held
every
year
for
these
general
chapters
every
abbot
of
the
order
was
required
to
appear
at
citeaux
to
which
they
all
looked
up
as
their
mother
those
who
were
in
the
nearer
countries
were
bound
to
attend
every
year
those
who
were
further
off
once
in
three
or
five
or
seven
years
according
to
distance
thus
the
smaller
houses
were
allowed
to
have
a
share
in
the
management
of
the
whole
and
the
plan
was
afterwards
imitated
by
carthusians
and
other
orders
i
need
not
mention
any
more
of
the
societies
of
monks
which
began
about
the
same
time
but
i
must
not
omit
to
say
that
the
crusades
gave
rise
to
what
are
called
of
which
the
first
and
most
famous
were
the
templars
and
the
hospitallers
or
knights
of
john
these
orders
were
governed
by
rules
which
were
much
like
those
of
the
monks
but
the
members
of
them
were
knights
who
undertook
to
defend
the
holy
land
against
the
unbelievers
the
hospitallers
were
at
first
connected
with
a
hospital
which
had
been
founded
at
jerusalem
for
the
benefit
of
pilgrims
by
some
italian
merchants
and
took
its
name
from
john
an
archbishop
of
alexandria
who
was
called
the
almsgiver
they
had
a
black
dress
with
a
white
cross
on
the
breast
and
from
having
been
at
first
employed
in
nursing
the
sick
and
relieving
the
poor
they
became
warriors
who
fought
against
the
mussulmans
the
templars
who
wore
a
white
dress
with
a
red
cross
on
the
breast
were
even
more
famous
as
soldiers
than
the
hospitallers
the
knights
of
both
these
orders
were
bound
by
their
rules
to
remain
unmarried
to
be
regular
and
frequent
in
their
religious
exercises
to
live
plainly
to
devote
themselves
to
the
defence
of
the
christian
faith
and
of
the
holy
land
and
for
the
sake
of
this
work
emperors
kings
and
other
wealthy
persons
bestowed
lands
and
other
gifts
on
them
so
that
they
had
large
estates
in
all
the
countries
of
europe
but
as
they
grew
rich
they
forgot
their
vows
of
poverty
and
humility
and
although
they
kept
up
their
character
for
bravery
they
were
generally
disliked
for
their
pride
and
insolence
we
shall
see
by
and
by
how
it
was
that
the
order
of
the
temple
came
to
ruin
but
the
hospitallers
lasted
longer
when
the
christians
were
driven
out
of
the
holy
land
the
knights
of
this
order
removed
first
to
cyprus
then
to
rhodes
and
last
of
all
to
malta
where
they
continued
even
until
quite
late
times
other
military
orders
were
founded
after
the
pattern
of
the
templars
and
the
hospitallers
the
most
famous
of
them
were
the
teutonic
or
german
knights
who
fought
the
heathens
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
sea
and
got
possession
of
a
large
country
which
afterwards
became
the
kingdom
of
prussia
and
the
order
of
james
which
belonged
to
spain
and
there
carried
on
a
continual
war
with
the
mahometan
moors
whose
settlement
in
that
country
has
already
been
mentioned

part
bernard
was
mentioned
a
little
way
back
when
we
were
speaking
of
the
cistercian
order
but
i
must
now
tell
you
something
more
specially
about
him
for
bernard
was
not
only
famous
for
his
piety
and
for
his
eloquent
speech
but
by
means
of
these
he
gained
such
power
and
influence
that
he
was
able
to
direct
the
course
of
things
in
the
church
in
such
a
way
as
no
other
man
ever
did
page
bernard
then
was
born
near
dijon
in
burgundy
in
the
year
his
father
was
a
knight
his
mother
aletha
was
a
very
religious
woman
who
watched
carefully
over
his
childhood
and
prayed
earnestly
and
often
that
he
might
be
kept
from
the
dangers
of
an
evil
world
as
bernard
was
passing
from
boyhood
to
youth
the
good
aletha
died
we
are
told
that
even
to
her
last
breath
she
joined
in
the
prayers
and
of
the
clergy
who
stood
round
her
bed
and
he
afterwards
fancied
that
she
appeared
to
him
in
visions
warning
him
lest
he
should
run
off
in
pursuit
of
worldly
learning
so
as
to
forget
the
importance
of
religion
above
all
things
after
a
time
bernard
was
led
to
resolve
on
becoming
a
monk
but
before
doing
so
he
contrived
to
bring
his
father
his
uncle
his
five
brothers
and
his
sister
to
the
same
mind
and
when
he
asked
leave
to
enter
the
cistercian
order
it
was
at
the
head
of
a
party
of
more
than
thirty
it
is
said
that
as
they
were
setting
out
the
eldest
brother
saw
the
youngest
at
play
and
told
him
that
all
the
family
property
would
now
fall
to
him
is
it
heaven
for
you
and
earth
for
me
said
the
boy
that
is
not
a
fair
division
and
he
followed
bernard
with
the
rest
we
have
seen
that
although
the
cistercian
order
had
been
founded
some
years
people
were
afraid
to
join
it
because
the
rule
was
so
strict
but
the
example
of
bernard
and
his
companions
had
a
great
effect
and
so
many
others
were
thus
led
to
enter
the
order
that
the
was
far
too
small
to
hold
them
bernard
was
chosen
to
be
head
of
one
of
the
swarms
which
went
forth
from
citeaux
the
name
of
his
new
monastery
was
clairvaux
which
means
bright
when
he
and
his
party
first
settled
there
they
had
to
bear
terrible
hardships
they
suffered
from
cold
and
from
want
of
clothing
for
a
time
they
had
to
feed
on
porridge
made
of
and
even
when
the
worst
distress
was
over
the
plainness
and
poverty
of
their
way
of
living
astonished
all
who
saw
it
page
bernard
himself
went
so
far
in
mortification
that
he
made
himself
very
ill
and
would
most
likely
have
died
if
a
bishop
who
was
his
friend
had
not
stepped
in
and
taken
care
of
him
for
a
time
bernard
afterwards
understood
that
he
had
been
wrong
in
carrying
things
so
far
but
the
people
who
saw
how
he
had
worn
himself
down
by
fasting
and
frequent
prayer
were
willing
to
let
themselves
be
led
to
anything
that
so
saintly
a
man
might
recommend
to
them
it
was
even
believed
that
he
had
the
gift
of
doing
miracles
and
this
added
much
to
the
admiration
which
he
raised
wherever
he
went
perhaps
there
never
was
a
man
who
had
greater
influence
than
bernard
for
although
he
did
not
rise
to
be
anything
more
than
abbot
of
clairvaux
and
refused
all
higher
offices
he
was
able
by
the
power
of
his
speech
and
by
the
fame
of
his
saintliness
to
turn
kings
and
princes
popes
and
emperors
and
even
whole
assemblies
of
men
in
any
way
that
he
pleased
when
two
popes
had
been
chosen
in
opposition
to
each
other
bernard
was
able
to
draw
all
the
chief
princes
of
christendom
into
siding
with
that
pope
whose
cause
he
had
taken
up
and
when
the
other
pope
successor
had
been
brought
so
low
that
he
could
carry
on
his
claims
no
longer
he
went
to
bernard
entreating
him
to
plead
for
him
with
the
successful
pope
innocent
and
was
led
by
the
abbot
to
throw
himself
humbly
as
a
penitent
at
innocent
feet
some
years
after
this
one
of
bernard
old
pupils
was
chosen
as
pope
and
took
the
name
of
eugenius
iii
eugenius
was
much
under
the
direction
of
his
old
master
and
bernard
like
a
true
friend
wrote
a
book
on
consideration
which
he
sent
to
eugenius
showing
him
the
chief
faults
which
were
in
the
roman
church
and
earnestly
exhorting
the
pope
to
reform
them
part
ii
bernard
was
even
the
chief
means
of
getting
up
a
new
crusade
when
tidings
came
from
the
east
that
the
christians
in
those
parts
had
suffered
heavy
losses
he
travelled
over
great
part
of
france
and
along
the
river
rhine
in
order
to
enlist
people
for
the
holy
war
he
gathered
meetings
at
which
he
spoke
in
such
a
way
as
to
move
all
hearts
and
stirred
up
his
hearers
to
such
an
eagerness
for
crusading
that
they
even
tore
the
clothes
off
his
back
in
order
to
divide
them
into
little
bits
which
might
serve
as
crusaders
badges
and
he
drew
in
the
emperor
conrad
and
king
lewis
vii
of
france
besides
a
number
of
smaller
princes
to
join
the
expedition
although
it
was
so
hard
to
persuade
conrad
that
when
at
last
he
was
brought
over
it
was
regarded
as
a
miracle
it
had
been
found
at
the
time
of
the
first
crusade
that
many
people
were
disposed
to
fall
on
the
jews
of
their
own
neighbourhood
as
being
enemies
of
christ
no
less
than
the
mahometans
of
the
holy
land
and
the
same
was
repeated
now
but
bernard
strongly
set
his
face
against
this
kind
of
cruelty
and
was
not
only
the
means
of
saving
the
lives
of
many
jews
but
brought
the
chief
preacher
of
the
persecution
to
own
with
sorrow
and
shame
that
he
had
been
utterly
wrong
although
however
a
vast
army
was
raised
for
the
recovery
of
the
holy
land
and
although
both
the
emperor
and
the
french
king
went
at
the
head
of
it
nothing
came
of
the
crusade
except
that
vast
numbers
of
lives
were
sacrificed
without
any
gain
and
even
bernard
great
fame
as
a
saint
was
not
enough
to
protect
him
from
blame
on
account
of
the
part
which
he
had
taken
in
getting
up
this
unfortunate
attempt
these
were
some
of
the
most
remarkable
things
in
which
bernard
command
over
men
minds
was
shown
and
he
was
able
also
to
get
the
better
of
some
persons
who
taught
wrong
or
doubtful
opinions
even
although
they
may
have
been
men
of
sharper
wits
and
of
greater
learning
than
himself
in
short
bernard
was
the
leading
man
of
his
age
no
doubt
he
believed
many
things
which
we
should
think
superstitious
or
altogether
wrong
and
in
his
conduct
we
can
not
help
noticing
some
tokens
of
human
frailty
especially
a
jealous
love
of
the
power
and
influence
which
he
had
gained
but
although
he
was
not
without
his
defects
we
can
not
fail
to
see
in
him
an
honest
hearty
and
laborious
servant
of
god
and
we
shall
not
wish
to
grudge
him
the
title
of
which
was
granted
to
him
by
a
pope
in
and
has
ever
since
been
commonly
attached
to
his
name
bernard
died
in
chapter
xii
adrian
alexander
the
third
crusade
in
the
year
of
bernard
death
adrian
iv
was
chosen
pope
and
he
is
especially
to
be
noted
by
us
because
he
was
the
only
englishman
who
ever
held
the
papacy
his
name
at
first
was
nicolas
breakspeare
and
he
was
born
near
albans
where
in
his
youth
he
asked
to
be
received
into
the
famous
abbey
as
a
monk
but
the
monks
of
albans
refused
him
and
he
then
went
to
seek
his
fortune
abroad
where
he
rose
step
by
step
until
at
length
the
poor
hertfordshire
lad
who
would
have
had
no
chance
of
any
great
place
in
his
own
country
for
he
was
of
saxon
family
and
the
normans
after
the
conquest
kept
all
the
good
places
for
themselves
was
chosen
to
be
the
head
of
christendom
adrian
had
a
high
notion
of
the
greatness
and
dignity
of
his
office
when
the
emperor
frederick
i
who
is
called
or
went
from
germany
into
italy
and
was
visited
in
his
camp
by
the
pope
adrian
required
that
the
emperor
should
hold
his
stirrup
as
he
mounted
his
horse
and
said
that
such
had
been
the
custom
from
the
time
of
the
great
constantine
frederick
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
and
was
not
willing
to
submit
but
on
inquiry
he
found
that
a
late
emperor
lothair
had
held
a
pope
stirrup
and
then
he
agreed
to
do
the
like
but
he
took
care
to
do
it
so
awkwardly
that
every
one
who
saw
it
began
to
laugh
and
thus
he
made
his
submission
appear
like
a
joke
frederick
redbeard
carried
on
a
long
struggle
with
the
popes
when
at
adrian
death
two
rival
popes
had
been
chosen
the
emperor
required
them
to
let
him
judge
between
their
claims
and
as
one
of
them
alexander
refused
to
admit
any
earthly
judge
frederick
took
part
with
the
other
who
called
himself
victor
iv
and
when
victor
was
dead
frederick
set
up
three
more
one
after
another
to
oppose
alexander
but
alexander
had
the
kings
of
france
and
england
on
his
side
and
at
last
he
not
only
got
himself
firmly
settled
but
brought
frederick
to
entreat
for
peace
with
him
and
with
some
cities
of
north
italy
which
had
formed
themselves
into
what
was
called
the
lombard
league
but
we
must
not
believe
a
story
that
when
this
treaty
was
concluded
in
the
great
church
of
mark
at
venice
the
pope
put
his
foot
on
the
emperor
neck
and
the
choir
chanted
the
words
of
the
psalm
thou
shalt
go
upon
the
lion
and
the
adder
for
this
story
was
not
made
up
until
long
after
and
has
no
truth
at
all
in
it
it
was
in
alexander
iii
time
that
the
great
quarrel
between
henry
ii
of
england
and
archbishop
thomas
becket
took
place
becket
had
been
raised
by
the
king
favour
to
be
his
chancellor
and
afterwards
to
be
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
head
of
all
the
english
clergy
but
although
until
then
he
had
done
everything
just
as
the
king
wished
no
sooner
had
he
become
archbishop
than
he
turned
round
on
henry
he
claimed
that
any
clergyman
who
might
be
guilty
of
crimes
should
not
be
tried
by
the
king
judges
but
only
in
the
church
courts
he
was
willing
to
allow
that
if
a
clergyman
were
found
guilty
of
a
great
crime
in
these
courts
he
might
be
degraded
that
is
to
say
that
he
should
be
turned
out
of
the
ranks
of
the
clergy
and
that
when
he
had
thus
become
like
other
men
he
might
be
tried
like
any
other
man
for
any
fresh
offences
which
he
might
commit
but
for
the
first
crime
becket
would
allow
no
other
punishment
than
degradation
at
the
utmost
the
king
said
that
in
such
matters
clergy
and
laity
ought
to
be
alike
and
about
this
chiefly
the
two
quarrelled
although
there
were
also
other
matters
which
helped
to
stir
up
the
strife
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
king
way
the
archbishop
secretly
left
england
and
for
six
years
he
lived
in
france
where
king
lewis
treated
him
with
much
kindness
partly
because
this
seemed
a
good
way
to
annoy
the
king
of
england
but
at
length
peace
was
made
and
becket
had
returned
to
england
when
some
new
acts
of
his
provoked
the
king
to
utter
some
hasty
words
against
him
whereupon
four
knights
who
thought
to
do
henry
a
service
took
occasion
to
try
to
seize
the
archbishop
and
as
he
refused
to
go
with
them
murdered
him
in
his
own
cathedral
but
as
you
must
have
read
the
story
of
becket
in
the
history
of
england
i
need
not
spend
much
time
in
repeating
it
in
when
urban

was

tidings
reached
europe
that
jerusalem
had
been
taken
by
the
great
mussulman
hero

vast

returned
home
without

effected
the
deliverance

you
will
remember
how
richard
in
taking
his
way
through
austria
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
emperor
henry
the
son
of

xiii
innocent
the
third
part
i
the
popes
were
continually
increasing
their
power
in
many
ways
although
they
were
often
unable
to
hold
their
ground
in
their
own
city
but
were
driven
out
by
the
romans
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
seek
a
refuge
in
france
or
to
fix
their
court
for
a
time
in
some
little
italian
town
they
claimed
the
right
of
setting
up
and
plucking
down
emperors
and
kings
instead
of
asking
the
emperor
to
confirm
their
own
election
to
the
papacy
as
in
former
times
they
declared
that
no
one
could
be
emperor
without
their
consent
they
said
that
they
were
the
chief
lords
over
kingdoms
they
required
the
emperors
to
hold
their
stirrup
as
they
mounted
on
horseback
and
the
rein
of
their
bridle
as
they
rode
and
while
such
was
their
treatment
of
earthly
princes
they
also
steadily
tried
to
get
into
their
own
hands
the
powers
which
properly
belonged
to
bishops
so
that
the
bishops
should
seem
to
have
no
rights
of
their
own
but
to
hold
their
office
and
to
do
whatever
they
did
only
through
the
pope
leave
and
as
his
servants
they
contrived
that
whenever
any
difference
arose
in
the
church
of
any
country
instead
of
being
settled
on
the
spot
it
should
be
carried
by
an
appeal
to
rome
that
the
pope
might
judge
it
they
declared
themselves
to
be
above
any
councils
of
bishops
and
claimed
the
power
of
assembling
general
councils
although
in
earlier
times
this
power
had
belonged
to
the
emperors
as
was
seen
in
the
case
of
the
first
great
council
of
nicæa
they
interfered
with
the
election
of
bishops
and
with
the
appointment
of
clergy
to
offices
in
every
country
and
they
sent
into
every
country
their
ambassadors
or
as
they
were
called
whom
they
charged
people
to
respect
and
obey
as
they
would
respect
and
obey
the
pope
himself
these
legates
usually
made
themselves
hated
by
their
pride
and
greediness
for
they
set
themselves
up
far
above
the
archbishops
and
bishops
of
any
country
that
they
might
be
sent
into
and
they
squeezed
out
from
the
clergy
of
each
country
which
they
visited
the
means
of
keeping
up
their
pomp
and
splendour
the
popes
who
followed
gregory
vii
all
endeavoured
to
act
in
his
spirit
and
to
push
the
claims
of
their
see
further
and
further
and
of
these
popes
by
far
the
strongest
and
most
successful
was
innocent
who
was
only
years
old
when
he
was
elected
in
i
have
told
you
how
gregory
said
that
the
papacy
was
as
much
greater
than
any
earthly
power
as
the
sun
is
than
the
moon
and
now
innocent
carried
out
this
further
by
saying
that
as
the
lesser
light
the
moon
borrows
of
the
greater
light
the
sun
so
the
royal
power
is
borrowed
from
the
priestly
power
innocent
pretended
to
a
right
of
judging
between
the
princes
who
claimed
the
empire
and
the
kingdom
of
germany
and
of
making
an
emperor
by
his
own
choice
he
forced
the
king
of
france
philip
augustus
to
do
justice
to
a
virtuous
danish
princess
whom
he
had
married
and
had
afterwards
put
away
and
he
forced
john
of
england
to
accept
stephen
langton
as
archbishop
of
canterbury
although
langton
was
appointed
by
the
pope
without
any
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
clergy
or
of
the
sovereign
of
england
both
in
france
and
in
england
innocent
made
use
of
what
was
called
an
to
make
people
submit
to
his
will
by
this
sentence
which
had
first
come
into
use
about
three
hundred
years
before
a
whole
country
was
punished
at
once
the
bad
and
the
good
alike
all
the
churches
were
closed
all
the
bells
were
silenced
all
the
outward
signs
of
religion
were
taken
away
there
was
no
blessing
for
marriage
there
were
no
prayers
at
the
burial
of
the
dead
the
baptism
of
children
and
the
office
for
the
dying
were
the
only
services
of
the
church
which
were
allowed
while
the
interdict
lasted
and
it
was
commonly
found
that
although
a
king
might
not
himself
care
for
any
spiritual
threats
or
sentences
which
the
pope
might
utter
he
was
unable
to
hold
out
against
the
general
feeling
of
his
people
who
could
not
bear
to
be
without
the
rites
of
religion
and
cried
out
that
the
innocent
thousands
were
punished
for
the
sake
of
one
guilty
person
john
was
completely
subdued
to
the
papacy
and
agreed
to
give
up
his
crown
to
the
pope
commissioner
pandulf
after
which
he
received
it
again
from
pandulf
hands
and
promised
to
hold
the
kingdoms
of
england
and
ireland
under
the
condition
of
paying
a
yearly
tribute
as
an
acknowledgment
that
the
pope
was
his
lord
archbishop
langton
although
he
had
been
forced
on
the
english
church
by
the
pope
yet
afterwards
took
a
different
line
from
what
might
have
been
expected
for
when
john
by
his
tyranny
provoked
his
barons
to
rise
against
him
the
archbishop
was
at
the
head
of
those
who
wrung
from
the
king
the
great
charter
as
a
security
for
english
liberty
and
although
the
pope
was
violently
angry
and
threatened
to
punish
the
archbishop
and
the
barons
severely
langton
stood
firmly
by
the
cause
which
he
had
taken
up
part
ii
while
innocent
was
thus
carrying
things
with
a
high
hand
among
the
christians
of
the
west
he
could
not
but
feel
distress
about
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
east
there
countries
which
had
once
been
christian
and
among
them
the
holy
land
where
the
saviour
had
lived
and
died
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
unbelievers
and
all
the
efforts
which
had
been
made
to
recover
them
had
hitherto
been
vain
the
pope
mind
was
set
on
a
new
crusade
and
in
order
to
raise
money
for
it
he
gave
much
out
of
his
own
purse
stinted
himself
as
to
his
manner
of
living
obliged
the
cardinals
and
others
around
him
to
do
the
like
and
caused
collections
to
be
gathered
throughout
western
christendom
eloquent
preachers
were
sent
about
to
stir
people
up
to
the
great
work
and
the
chief
beginning
was
made
at
a
place
called
ecry
in
the
north
of
france
it
so
happened
that
the
most
famous
of
the
preachers
whose
name
was
fulk
arrived
there
just
as
a
number
of
nobles
and
knights
were
met
for
a
tournament
which
was
the
name
given
to
the
fights
of
knights
on
horseback
which
were
regarded
as
sport
but
very
often
ended
in
sad
earnest
fulk
by
the
power
of
his
speech
persuaded
most
of
these
gallant
knights
at
ecry
to
take
the
cross
and
as
the
number
of
crusaders
grew
some
of
them
were
sent
to
venice
to
provide
means
for
their
being
carried
by
sea
to
egypt
which
was
the
country
in
which
it
was
thought
that
the
mahometans
might
be
attacked
with
the
best
hope
of
success
when
these
envoys
reached
venice
which
was
then
the
chief
trading
city
of
europe
they
found
the
venetians
very
willing
to
supply
what
they
wanted
it
was
agreed
that
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
the
venetians
should
prepare
ships
and
provisions
for
the
number
of
crusaders
which
was
expected
and
they
did
so
accordingly
but
when
the
crusaders
came
it
was
found
that
their
numbers
fell
short
of
what
had
been
reckoned
on
for
many
had
chosen
other
ways
of
going
to
the
east
and
as
the
venetians
would
take
nothing
less
than
the
sum
which
they
had
bargained
for
the
crusaders
with
their
lessened
numbers
found
themselves
unable
to
pay
in
this
difficulty
the
venetians
proposed
that
instead
of
the
money
which
could
not
be
raised
the
crusaders
should
give
them
their
help
against
the
city
of
zara
in
dalmatia
with
which
venice
had
a
quarrel
the
crusaders
were
very
unwilling
to
do
this
because
the
pope
in
giving
his
consent
to
their
enterprise
had
forbidden
them
to
turn
their
arms
against
any
christians
but
they
contrived
to
persuade
themselves
that
the
pope
words
were
not
to
be
understood
too
exactly
and
at
a
meeting
in
the
great
church
of
mark
henry
dandolo
the
doge
or
duke
of
venice
took
the
cross
and
declared
to
the
vast
multitude
of
citizens
and
crusaders
who
crowded
the
church
that
although
he
was
years
of
age
and
almost
or
altogether
blind
he
himself
would
be
the
leader
a
fleet
of
nearly
five
hundred
vessels
sailed
from
venice
accordingly
and
zara
was
taken
after
a
siege
of
six
days
although
the
inhabitants
tried
to
soften
the
feelings
of
the
besiegers
by
displaying
crosses
and
sacred
pictures
from
the
walls
as
tokens
of
their
brotherhood
in
christ
after
this
success
the
crusaders
were
bound
by
their
engagement
to
go
on
to
egypt
or
the
holy
land
but
a
young
greek
prince
named
alexius
entreated
them
to
restore
his
father
who
had
been
dethroned
by
a
usurper
to
the
empire
of
the
east
and
although
the
french
were
unwilling
to
undertake
any
work
that
might
interfere
with
the
recovery
of
the
holy
land
the
venetians
who
cared
little
for
anything
but
their
own
gain
persuaded
them
to
turn
aside
to
constantinople
when
the
crusaders
came
in
sight
of
the
city
they
were
so
astonished
at
the
beauty
of
its
lofty
walls
and
towers
of
its
palaces
and
its
many
churches
that
as
we
are
told
the
hearts
of
the
boldest
among
them
beat
with
a
feeling
which
could
not
be
kept
down
and
many
of
them
even
burst
into
tears
they
found
the
harbour
protected
by
a
great
chain
which
was
drawn
across
the
mouth
of
it
but
this
chain
was
broken
by
the
force
of
a
ship
which
was
driven
against
it
with
the
sails
swollen
by
a
strong
wind
the
blind
old
doge
henry
dandolo
stood
in
the
prow
of
the
foremost
ship
and
was
the
first
to
land
in
the
face
of
the
greeks
who
stood
ready
to
defend
the
ground
constantinople
was
soon
won
and
the
emperor
who
had
been
deposed
and
blinded
by
the
usurper
was
brought
from
his
dungeon
and
was
enthroned
in
the
great
church
of
sophia
while
his
son
alexius
was
anointed
and
crowned
as
a
partner
in
the
empire
but
quarrels
soon
arose
between
the
greeks
and
the
latins
alexius
was
murdered
by
a
new
usurper
his
father
died
of
grief
and
the
crusaders
found
themselves
drawn
on
to
conquer
the
city
afresh
for
themselves
this
conquest
was
disgraced
by
much
cruelty
and
unchecked
plunder
and
the
religion
of
the
greeks
was
outraged
by
the
latin
victors
as
much
as
it
could
have
been
by
heathen
barbarians
the
crusaders
set
up
an
emperor
and
a
patriarch
of
their
own
and
the
greek
clergy
were
forced
to
give
way
to
latins
the
pope
although
he
was
much
disappointed
at
finding
that
his
plan
for
the
recovery
of
the
holy
land
had
come
to
nothing
was
yet
persuaded
by
the
greatness
of
the
conquest
to
give
a
kind
of
approval
to
it
but
the
latin
empire
of
the
east
was
never
strong
and
after
about
seventy
years
it
was
overthrown
by
the
greeks
who
drove
out
the
latins
and
restored
their
own
form
of
christian
religion
innocent
did
not
give
up
the
notion
of
a
crusade
and
at
a
later
time
he
sent
about
preachers
to
stir
up
the
people
of
the
west
afresh
but
nothing
had
come
of
this
when
the
pope
died
i
must
however
mention
a
strange
thing
which
arose
out
of
this
attempt
at
a
crusade
a
shepherd
boy
named
stephen
who
lived
near
vendome
in
the
province
of
orleans
gave
out
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
of
the
saviour
and
had
been
charged
by
him
to
preach
the
cross
by
this
tale
stephen
gathered
some
children
about
him
and
they
set
off
for
the
crusade
displaying
crosses
and
banners
and
chanting
in
every
town
or
village
through
which
they
passed
o
lord
help
us
to
recover
thy
true
and
holy
cross
when
they
reached
paris
there
were
no
less
than
of
them
and
as
they
went
along
their
numbers
became
greater
and
greater
if
any
parents
tried
to
keep
back
their
children
from
joining
them
it
was
of
no
use
even
if
they
shut
them
up
it
was
believed
that
the
children
were
able
to
break
through
bars
and
locks
in
order
to
follow
stephen
and
his
companions
ignorant
people
fancied
that
stephen
could
work
miracles
and
treasured
up
threads
of
his
dress
as
precious
relics
at
length
the
company
whose
numbers
had
reached
arrived
at
marseilles
where
stephen
entered
the
city
in
a
triumphal
car
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
guards
some
shipowners
undertook
to
convey
the
to
egypt
and
africa
for
nothing
but
these
were
wretches
who
meant
to
sell
them
as
slaves
to
the
mahometans
and
this
was
the
fate
of
such
of
the
children
as
reached
the
african
coast
after
many
of
them
had
been
lost
by
shipwreck
on
the
way
innocent
although
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
crusade
or
with
one
of
the
same
kind
which
was
got
up
in
germany
declared
that
the
zeal
of
the
children
put
to
shame
the
coldness
of
their
elders
whom
he
was
still
labouring
with
little
success
to
enlist
in
the
cause
of
the
holy
land
part
iii
a
war
of
a
different
kind
but
which
was
also
styled
a
crusade
was
carried
on
in
the
south
of
france
while
innocent
was
pope
in
that
country
there
were
great
numbers
of
persons
who
did
not
agree
with
the
roman
church
and
who
are
known
by
the
names
of
waldenses
and
albigenses
the
opinions
of
these
two
parties
differed
greatly
from
each
other
the
waldenses
whose
name
was
given
to
them
from
peter
waldo
of
lyons
who
founded
the
party
about
the
year
were
a
quiet
set
of
people
something
like
the
quakers
of
our
own
time
they
dressed
and
lived
plainly
they
were
mild
in
their
manners
and
used
some
rather
affected
ways
of
speech
they
thought
all
war
and
all
oaths
wrong
they
did
not
acknowledge
the
claims
of
the
clergy
and
although
they
attended
the
services
of
the
church
it
is
said
that
they
secretly
mocked
at
them
they
were
fond
of
reading
the
holy
scripture
in
their
own
language
while
the
roman
church
would
only
allow
it
to
be
read
in
latin
which
was
understood
by
few
except
the
clergy
and
not
by
all
of
and
so
eager
were
the
waldenses
to
bring
people
to
their
own
way
of
thinking
that
we
are
told
of
one
of
them
a
poor
man
who
after
his
day
work
used
to
swim
across
a
river
in
wintry
nights
that
he
might
reach
a
person
whom
he
wished
to
convert
the
albigenses
on
whom
the
persecution
chiefly
fell
held
something
like
the
doctrines
of
manes
whom
i
mentioned
a
long
way
back
so
that
they
could
not
properly
be
considered
as
christians
at
all
but
although
we
can
not
think
well
of
their
doctrines
the
treatment
of
these
people
was
so
cruel
and
so
treacherous
as
to
raise
the
strongest
feelings
of
anger
and
horror
in
all
who
read
the
accounts
of
it
tens
of
thousands
were
slain
and
their
rich
and
beautiful
country
was
turned
into
a
desert
part
the
chief
leader
of
the
crusade
in
the
south
of
france
was
simon
de
montfort
father
of
that
earl
simon
who
is
famous
in
the
history
of
england
innocent
although
he
seems
to
have
been
much
deceived
by
those
who
reported
matters
to
him
was
grievously
to
blame
for
having
given
too
much
countenance
to
the
cruelties
and
injustice
which
were
practised
against
the
unhappy
albigenses
among
the
clergy
who
accompanied
the
crusaders
into
southern
france
and
tried
to
bring
over
the
albigenses
and
waldenses
to
the
roman
church
was
a
spaniard
named
dominic
who
afterwards
became
famous
as
the
founder
of
an
order
of
mendicant
friars
that
is
to
say
he
also
founded
the
inquisition
which
was
a
body
intended
to
search
out
and
to
put
down
all
opinions
differing
from
the
doctrines
of
the
roman
church
but
the
cruelty
darkness
and
treachery
of
its
proceedings
were
so
shocking
that
although
dominic
was
certainly
its
founder
we
need
not
suppose
that
he
would
have
approved
of
all
its
doings
the
waldenses
and
albigenses
had
been
used
to
reproach
the
clergy
of
the
church
for
their
habits
of
pomp
and
luxury
and
dominic
had
done
what
he
could
to
meet
these
charges
by
the
plainness
and
hardness
of
the
life
which
he
and
his
companions
led
while
labouring
in
the
south
of
france
and
when
he
resolved
to
found
a
new
order
of
monks
he
carried
the
notion
of
poverty
to
an
extreme
his
followers
were
to
be
not
only
poor
but
beggars
they
were
to
live
on
alms
and
from
day
to
day
refusing
any
gifts
of
money
so
large
as
to
give
the
notion
of
a
settled
provision
for
their
needs
part
iv
about
the
same
time
another
great
begging
order
was
founded
by
francis
who
was
born
in
at
assisi
a
town
in
the
italian
duchy
of
spoleto
the
stories
as
to
his
early
days
are
very
strange
indeed
it
would
seem
that
when
he
was
struck
with
a
religious
idea
he
could
not
carry
it
out
without
such
oddities
of
behaviour
as
in
most
people
would
look
like
signs
of
a
mind
not
altogether
right
when
francis
heard
in
church
our
lord
charge
to
his
apostles
that
they
should
go
forth
without
money
in
their
purses
or
a
staff
or
scrip
or
shoes
or
changes
of
raiment
x
he
went
before
the
bishop
of
assisi
and
stripping
off
all
his
other
clothes
he
set
forth
to
preach
repentance
without
having
anything
on
him
but
a
rough
gray
woollen
frock
with
a
rope
tied
round
his
waist
he
fancied
that
he
was
called
by
a
vision
to
repair
a
certain
church
and
he
set
about
gathering
the
money
for
this
purpose
by
singing
and
begging
in
the
streets
he
felt
an
especial
charity
for
lepers
who
on
account
of
their
loathsome
disease
were
shut
out
from
the
company
of
men
and
were
subject
to
miseries
of
many
kinds
and
although
many
hospitals
had
already
been
founded
in
various
countries
for
these
unfortunate
people
the
kindness
which
francis
showed
to
them
had
a
great
effect
in
lightening
their
lot
so
far
as
human
could
do
so
francis
wished
his
followers
to
study
humility
in
all
ways
they
were
to
seek
to
be
despised
and
were
told
to
be
uneasy
if
they
met
with
usage
of
any
other
kind
they
were
not
to
let
themselves
be
called
but
they
must
try
to
be
reckoned
as
less
than
any
other
persons
they
were
especially
to
be
on
their
guard
against
the
pride
of
learning
and
in
order
to
preserve
them
from
the
danger
of
this
francis
would
hardly
allow
them
even
a
book
of
the
psalms
but
in
truth
all
these
things
might
really
be
turned
the
opposite
way
and
in
making
such
studied
shows
of
humility
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
franciscans
might
fall
under
the
temptations
of
pride
francis
was
very
fond
of
animals
which
he
treated
as
reasonable
creatures
speaking
to
them
by
the
names
of
brothers
and
sisters
he
used
to
call
his
own
body
on
account
of
the
heavy
burdens
and
the
hard
usage
which
it
had
to
bear
he
kept
a
sheep
in
church
and
it
is
said
that
the
creature
without
any
training
used
to
take
part
in
the
services
by
kneeling
and
bleating
at
proper
times
he
preached
to
flocks
of
birds
on
the
duty
of
thanking
their
maker
for
his
goodness
to
them
nay
he
preached
to
fishes
to
worms
and
even
to
flowers
perhaps
the
oddest
story
of
this
kind
is
one
about
his
dealing
with
a
wolf
which
infested
the
neighbourhood
of
gubbio
finding
that
every
one
in
the
place
was
overcome
by
fear
of
this
fierce
beast
francis
went
out
boldly
to
the
forest
where
the
wolf
lived
and
meeting
him
began
to
talk
to
him
about
the
wickedness
of
killing
not
only
brute
animals
but
men
and
he
promised
that
if
the
wolf
would
give
up
such
evil
ways
the
citizens
of
gubbio
would
maintain
him
he
then
held
out
his
right
hand
whereupon
the
wolf
put
his
paw
into
it
as
a
sign
of
agreement
and
allowed
the
saint
to
lead
him
into
the
town
the
people
of
gubbio
were
only
too
glad
to
fulfil
the
promise
which
francis
had
made
for
them
and
they
kept
the
wolf
handsomely
giving
him
his
meals
by
turns
until
he
died
of
old
age
and
in
such
general
respect
that
he
was
lamented
by
all
gubbio
there
is
a
strange
story
that
francis
towards
the
end
of
his
life
received
in
his
body
what
are
called
the
that
is
to
say
the
marks
of
the
wounds
which
were
made
in
our
lord
body
at
the
crucifixion
and
a
great
number
of
other
superstitious
tales
became
connected
with
his
name
but
with
such
things
we
need
not
here
trouble
ourselves
when
dominic
and
francis
each
applied
to
pope
innocent
for
his
approval
of
their
designs
to
found
new
orders
he
was
not
forward
to
give
it
but
on
thinking
the
matter
over
he
granted
them
what
they
asked
each
of
them
soon
gathered
followers
who
spread
into
all
lands
the
franciscans
especially
made
converts
from
heathenism
by
missions
and
these
orders
by
their
rough
and
plain
habits
of
life
made
their
way
to
the
hearts
of
the
poorest
classes
in
a
degree
which
had
never
been
known
before
and
the
influence
which
they
thus
gained
was
all
used
for
the
papacy
which
found
them
the
most
active
and
useful
of
all
its
servants
in
the
year
innocent
held
a
great
council
at
rome
what
is
known
as
the
fourth
lateran
council
and
is
to
be
remembered
for
two
of
its
canons
by
one
of
which
the
false
doctrine
of
the
roman
church
as
to
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
was
for
the
first
time
established
and
by
the
other
it
was
made
the
duty
of
every
one
in
the
roman
church
to
confess
to
the
priest
of
his
parish
at
least
once
a
year
chapter
xiv
frederick
st
lewis
of
france
part
i
the
popes
still
tried
to
stir
up
the
christians
of
the
west
for
the
recovery
of
the
holy
land
and
there
were
crusading
attempts
from
time
to
time
although
without
much
effect
one
of
these
crusades
was
undertaken
in
by
frederick
an
emperor
who
was
all
his
life
engaged
in
struggles
against
one
pope
after
another
frederick
had
taken
the
cross
when
he
was
very
young
but
when
once
any
one
had
done
so
the
popes
thought
that
they
were
entitled
to
call
on
him
to
fulfil
his
promise
at
any
time
they
pleased
no
matter
what
other
business
he
might
have
on
his
hands
he
was
expected
to
set
off
on
a
crusade
whenever
the
pope
might
bid
him
although
it
might
be
ruinous
to
him
to
be
called
away
from
his
own
affairs
at
that
time
in
this
way
then
the
popes
had
got
a
hold
on
frederick
and
when
he
answered
their
summons
by
saying
that
his
affairs
at
home
would
not
just
then
allow
him
to
go
on
a
crusade
they
treated
this
excuse
as
if
he
had
refused
altogether
to
go
they
held
him
up
to
the
world
as
a
faithless
man
and
threatened
to
put
his
lands
under
an
interdict
and
to
take
away
his
crown
and
when
at
last
frederick
found
himself
able
to
go
to
the
holy
land
the
pope
and
his
friends
set
themselves
against
him
with
all
their
might
saying
that
he
was
not
hearty
in
the
cause
and
even
that
he
was
not
a
christian
at
all
so
that
although
frederick
made
a
treaty
with
the
mahometans
by
which
a
great
deal
was
gained
for
the
christians
it
came
to
little
or
nothing
because
the
popes
would
not
confirm
it
see
page
i
need
not
say
much
more
about
frederick
ii
there
was
very
much
in
him
that
we
can
not
approve
of
or
excuse
but
he
met
with
hard
usage
from
the
popes
and
after
his
death
they
pursued
his
family
with
constant
hatred
until
the
last
heir
a
spirited
young
prince
named
conradin
who
boldly
attempted
to
recover
the
dominions
of
his
family
in
southern
italy
was
made
prisoner
and
executed
at
naples
in
part
ii
at
the
same
time
with
frederick
lived
a
sovereign
of
a
very
different
kind
lewis
ix
of
france
who
is
commonly
called
lewis
and
deserves
the
name
of
better
than
very
many
persons
to
whom
it
is
given
there
was
a
great
deal
in
the
religion
of
lewis
that
we
should
call
superstition
but
he
laboured
very
earnestly
to
live
up
to
the
notions
of
christian
religion
which
were
commonly
held
in
his
time
he
attended
several
services
in
church
every
day
and
when
he
was
told
that
his
nobles
found
fault
with
this
he
answered
that
no
one
would
have
blamed
him
if
he
had
spent
twice
as
much
time
in
hunting
or
in
playing
at
dice
he
was
diligent
in
all
other
religious
exercises
he
refrained
from
all
worldly
sports
and
pastimes
and
as
far
as
could
be
he
shunned
the
pomp
of
royalty
he
was
very
careful
never
to
use
any
words
but
such
as
were
fit
for
a
christian
he
paid
great
respect
to
clergy
and
monks
and
said
that
if
he
could
divide
himself
into
two
he
would
give
one
half
to
the
dominicans
and
the
other
half
to
the
franciscans
it
is
even
said
that
at
one
time
he
would
himself
have
turned
friar
if
his
queen
had
not
persuaded
him
that
he
would
do
better
by
remaining
a
king
and
studying
to
govern
well
and
to
benefit
the
church
but
with
all
this
lewis
took
care
that
the
popes
should
not
get
more
power
over
the
french
church
than
he
thought
due
to
them
and
if
any
bishop
had
tried
to
play
the
same
part
in
france
which
becket
played
in
english
history
we
may
be
sure
that
lewis
would
have
set
himself
steadily
against
him
in
jerusalem
was
taken
by
the
mongols
a
barbarous
heathen
people
who
had
none
of
that
respect
which
the
mahometans
had
shown
for
the
holy
places
of
the
jewish
and
christian
religions
thus
these
holy
places
were
now
profaned
in
a
way
which
had
not
been
known
before
and
stories
of
outrages
done
by
the
new
conquerors
with
cries
for
help
from
the
christians
of
the
holy
land
reached
the
west
soon
after
this
king
lewis
had
a
dangerous
illness
in
which
his
life
was
given
over
he
had
been
for
some
time
speechless
and
was
even
supposed
to
be
dead
when
he
asked
that
the
cross
might
be
given
to
him
and
as
soon
as
he
had
thus
engaged
himself
to
the
crusade
he
began
to
recover
his
wife
his
mother
and
others
tried
to
persuade
him
that
he
was
not
bound
by
his
promise
because
it
had
been
made
at
a
time
when
he
was
not
master
of
himself
but
lewis
would
not
listen
to
such
excuses
and
resolved
to
carry
it
out
faithfully
the
way
which
he
took
to
enlist
companions
was
very
curious
on
the
morning
of
christmas
day
when
a
very
solemn
service
was
to
be
held
in
the
chapel
of
his
palace
a
chapel
which
is
still
to
be
seen
and
is
among
the
most
beautiful
buildings
in
paris
he
caused
dresses
to
be
given
to
the
nobles
as
they
were
going
in
for
this
was
then
a
common
practice
with
kings
at
the
great
festivals
of
the
church
but
when
the
french
lords
after
having
received
their
new
robes
in
a
place
which
was
nearly
dark
went
on
into
the
chapel
which
was
bright
with
hundreds
of
lights
each
of
them
found
that
his
dress
was
marked
with
a
cross
so
that
according
to
the
notions
of
the
time
he
was
bound
to
go
to
the
holy
war
part
iii
the
king
did
what
he
could
to
raise
troops
and
appointed
his
mother
queen
blanche
to
govern
the
kingdom
during
his
absence
and
after
having
passed
a
winter
in
the
island
of
cyprus
he
reached
damietta
in
egypt
on
the
of
june
for
a
time
all
went
well
with
the
crusaders
but
soon
a
change
took
place
and
everything
seemed
to
turn
against
them
they
lost
some
of
their
best
leaders
a
plague
broke
out
and
carried
off
many
of
them
they
suffered
from
famine
so
that
they
were
even
obliged
to
eat
their
horses
and
the
enemy
by
opening
the
sluices
of
the
nile
let
loose
on
them
the
waters
of
the
river
which
carried
away
a
multitude
lewis
himself
was
very
ill
and
at
length
he
was
obliged
to
surrender
to
the
enemy
and
to
make
peace
on
terms
far
worse
than
those
which
he
had
before
refused
but
even
although
he
was
a
prisoner
his
saintly
life
made
the
mahometans
look
on
him
with
reverence
so
that
when
the
sultan
to
whom
he
had
become
prisoner
was
murdered
by
his
own
people
they
thought
of
choosing
the
captive
christian
king
for
their
chief
lewis
refused
to
make
any
treaty
for
his
deliverance
unless
all
his
companions
might
have
a
share
in
it
and
although
he
might
have
been
earlier
set
free
he
refused
to
leave
his
captivity
until
all
the
money
was
made
up
for
the
ransom
of
himself
and
his
followers
on
being
at
length
free
to
leave
egypt
he
went
into
the
holy
land
where
he
visited
nazareth
with
deep
devotion
but
although
he
eagerly
desired
to
see
jerusalem
he
denied
himself
this
pleasure
from
a
fear
that
the
crusading
spirit
might
die
out
if
the
first
of
christian
kings
should
consent
to
visit
the
holy
city
without
delivering
it
from
the
unbelievers
after
an
absence
of
six
years
lewis
was
called
back
to
france
by
tidings
that
his
mother
whom
he
had
left
as
regent
of
the
kingdom
was
dead
but
he
did
not
think
that
his
crusading
vow
was
yet
fulfilled
and
sixteen
years
later
he
set
out
on
a
second
attempt
which
was
still
more
unfortunate
than
the
former
on
landing
at
tunis
he
found
that
the
arabs
instead
of
joining
him
as
he
had
expected
attacked
his
force
but
these
were
not
his
worst
enemies
at
setting
out
the
king
had
been
too
weak
to
bear
armour
or
to
sit
on
horseback
and
after
landing
he
found
that
the
bad
climate
with
the
want
of
water
and
of
wholesome
food
spread
death
among
his
troops
one
of
his
own
sons
tristan
who
had
been
born
during
the
king
captivity
in
egypt
fell
sick
and
died
lewis
himself
whose
weak
state
made
him
an
easy
victim
to
disease
died
on
the
of
august
after
having
shown
in
his
last
hours
the
piety
which
had
throughout
marked
his
life
and
although
his
eldest
son
philip
recovered
from
an
attack
which
had
seemed
likely
to
be
fatal
the
crusaders
were
obliged
to
leave
that
deadly
coast
with
their
number
fearfully
lessened
and
without
having
gained
any
success
philip
on
his
return
to
france
had
to
carry
with
him
the
remains
of
his
father
of
his
brother
of
one
of
his
own
children
and
of
his
the
king
of
navarre
such
was
the
sad
end
of
an
expedition
undertaken
by
a
saintly
king
for
a
noble
purpose
but
without
heeding
those
rules
of
prudence
which
if
they
could
not
have
secured
success
might
at
least
have
taught
him
to
provide
against
some
of
the
dangers
which
were
fatal
to
him
chapter
xv
peter
of
murrone
in
that
age
the
papacy
was
sometimes
long
vacant
because
the
cardinals
who
were
the
highest
in
rank
of
the
roman
clergy
and
to
whom
the
choice
of
a
pope
belonged
could
not
agree
in
order
to
get
over
this
difficulty
rules
were
made
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
the
cardinals
to
make
a
speedy
choice
thus
at
a
council
which
was
held
by
pope
gregory
at
lyons
in
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
restoring
peace
and
fellowship
between
the
greek
and
latin
churches
a
canon
was
made
for
the
election
of
popes
this
canon
directed
that
the
cardinals
should
meet
for
the
choice
of
a
new
pope
within
ten
days
after
the
last
death
that
they
should
all
be
shut
up
in
a
large
room
which
from
their
being
locked
in
together
was
called
the
that
they
should
have
no
means
of
speaking
or
writing
to
any
person
outside
or
of
receiving
any
letters
that
their
food
should
be
supplied
through
a
window
that
if
they
did
not
make
their
choice
within
three
days
their
provisions
should
be
stinted
and
if
they
delayed
five
days
more
nothing
should
be
given
them
but
bread
and
water
by
such
means
it
was
thought
that
the
cardinals
might
be
brought
to
settle
the
election
of
a
pope
as
quickly
as
possible
meaning
and
meaning
we
can
well
believe
that
the
cardinals
did
not
like
to
be
put
under
such
rules
they
contrived
that
later
popes
should
make
some
changes
in
them
and
tried
to
go
on
as
before
putting
off
the
election
so
long
as
seemed
desirable
for
the
sake
of
their
own
selfish
objects
at
one
time
when
there
had
been
no
pope
for
six
months
the
people
of
viterbo
confined
the
cardinals
in
the
public
hall
of
their
city
until
an
election
should
be
made
at
another
time
the
cardinals
were
shut
up
in
a
roman
monastery
where
six
of
them
died
of
the
bad
air
but
one
cardinal
who
was
more
knowing
than
the
rest
drove
off
the
effect
of
the
air
by
keeping
up
fires
in
all
his
rooms
even
through
the
hottest
weather
and
at
length
he
was
chosen
pope
on
the
death
of
this
pope
nicolas
iv
his
office
was
vacant
for
two
years
and
a
quarter
and
when
the
cardinals
then
met
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
not
fix
on
any
successor
but
one
day
one
of
them
told
the
rest
that
a
holy
man
had
had
a
vision
threatening
heavy
judgments
unless
a
pope
were
chosen
within
a
certain
time
and
he
gave
such
an
account
of
this
holy
man
that
all
the
cardinals
were
struck
at
once
with
the
idea
of
choosing
for
pope
his
name
was
peter
of
murrone
he
lived
as
a
hermit
in
a
narrow
cell
on
a
mountain
and
there
he
was
found
by
certain
bishops
who
were
sent
by
the
cardinals
to
tell
him
of
his
election
he
was
years
of
age
roughly
dressed
with
a
long
white
beard
and
thin
from
fasting
and
hard
living
he
could
speak
no
other
tongue
than
the
common
language
of
the
around
and
he
was
quite
unused
to
business
of
any
kind
so
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
by
any
one
who
would
take
the
trouble
the
fame
of
peter
holiness
had
been
widely
spread
and
he
was
even
supposed
to
do
miracles
so
that
his
election
was
welcomed
by
multitudes
two
hundred
thousand
persons
flocked
to
see
his
coronation
where
the
old
man
appeared
in
the
procession
riding
on
an
ass
with
his
reins
held
by
the
king
of
naples
on
one
side
and
by
the
king
son
on
the
other
this
king
of
naples
charles
got
the
poor
old
pope
completely
into
his
power
he
made
him
take
up
his
abode
at
naples
where
celestine
as
he
was
now
called
tried
to
carry
on
his
old
way
of
life
by
getting
a
cell
built
in
his
palace
just
like
his
old
dwelling
on
the
rock
of
fumone
and
into
this
little
place
he
would
withdraw
for
days
leaving
all
the
work
of
his
office
to
be
done
by
some
cardinals
whom
he
trusted
other
stories
are
told
which
show
that
celestine
was
quite
unfit
for
his
office
the
cardinals
soon
came
to
think
that
they
had
made
a
great
mistake
in
choosing
him
and
at
length
the
poor
old
man
came
to
think
so
too
one
of
the
cardinals
benedict
gaetani
who
had
gained
a
great
influence
over
his
mind
persuaded
him
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
resign
and
after
having
been
pope
about
five
months
celestine
called
the
cardinals
together
and
read
to
them
a
paper
in
which
he
said
that
he
was
too
old
and
too
weak
to
bear
the
burden
of
his
office
that
he
wished
to
return
to
his
former
life
of
quiet
and
contemplation
he
then
put
off
his
robes
took
once
more
the
rough
dress
which
he
had
worn
as
a
hermit
and
withdrew
to
his
old
abode
but
the
jealousy
of
his
successor
did
not
allow
him
to
remain
there
in
peace
it
was
feared
that
the
reverence
in
which
the
old
hermit
was
held
by
the
common
people
might
lead
to
some
disturbance
and
to
prevent
this
he
was
shut
up
in
close
confinement
where
he
lived
only
about
ten
months
the
poorer
people
had
all
manner
of
strange
notions
about
his
holiness
and
his
supposed
miracles
and
about
twenty
years
after
his
death
he
was
admitted
into
the
roman
list
of
saints
chapter
xvi
boniface
viii
part
i
in
celestine
place
was
chosen
benedict
gaetani
who
although
even
older
than
the
and
doting
late
pope
was
still
full
of
strength
both
in
body
and
in
mind
benedict
who
took
the
name
of
boniface
viii
is
said
to
have
been
very
learned
especially
in
matters
of
law
but
his
pride
and
ambition
led
him
into
attempts
which
ended
in
his
own
ruin
and
did
serious
harm
to
the
papacy
in
the
year
boniface
set
on
foot
what
was
called
the
jubilee
you
will
remember
the
jubilee
which
god
in
the
law
of
moses
commanded
the
israelites
to
keep
leviticus
but
this
new
jubilee
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
of
moses
and
was
more
like
some
games
which
were
celebrated
every
hundredth
year
by
the
ancient
romans
nothing
of
the
sort
had
ever
before
been
known
among
christians
but
when
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
at
hand
it
was
found
that
people
minds
were
full
of
a
fancy
that
the
year
ought
to
be
a
time
of
some
great
celebration
nay
they
were
even
made
to
believe
that
such
a
way
of
keeping
every
hundredth
year
had
been
usual
from
the
beginning
of
the
church
although
as
i
have
said
there
was
no
ground
whatever
for
this
notion
and
one
or
two
lying
old
men
were
brought
forward
to
pretend
that
when
children
they
had
attended
a
former
jubilee
a
hundred
years
before
how
the
expectation
of
the
jubilee
was
got
up
we
do
not
know
most
likely
boniface
had
something
to
do
with
it
at
all
events
he
took
it
up
and
reaped
the
profits
of
it
he
sent
forth
letters
offering
extraordinary
spiritual
benefits
to
all
who
should
visit
rome
and
the
tombs
of
peter
and
paul
during
the
coming
year
and
immense
numbers
of
people
flocked
together
from
all
parts
of
europe
it
is
said
that
all
through
the
year
there
were
two
hundred
thousand
strangers
in
rome
for
as
some
went
away
others
came
to
fill
up
their
places
the
crowd
is
described
to
us
as
if
in
the
streets
and
on
the
bridge
leading
to
the
great
church
of
peter
an
army
were
marching
each
way
it
is
said
that
boniface
appeared
one
day
in
the
robes
of
a
pope
and
next
day
in
those
of
an
emperor
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
that
he
declared
to
some
ambassadors
that
he
was
both
pope
and
emperor
and
after
all
this
display
of
his
pride
and
grandeur
he
found
himself
much
enriched
by
the
offerings
which
the
pilgrims
had
made
for
these
were
so
large
that
in
one
church
alone
as
we
are
told
two
of
the
clergy
were
employed
day
and
night
in
gathering
them
in
with
long
rakes
if
this
be
anything
like
the
truth
the
whole
amount
collected
from
the
pilgrims
at
the
jubilee
must
have
been
very
large
indeed
part
ii
boniface
got
into
serious
quarrels
with
princes
and
others
but
the
most
serious
of
them
all
was
a
quarrel
with
philip
iv
of
france
who
is
called
on
account
of
his
good
looks
not
that
there
was
any
fairness
in
his
character
for
it
would
not
be
easy
to
name
any
one
more
utterly
if
boniface
wished
to
exalt
himself
above
princes
philip
who
was
a
thoroughly
hard
cold
selfish
man
was
no
less
desirous
to
get
the
mastery
over
the
clergy
and
it
was
natural
that
between
two
such
persons
unpleasant
differences
should
arise
i
need
not
mention
the
particulars
except
that
boniface
wrote
letters
which
seemed
to
forbid
the
clergy
of
any
kingdom
to
pay
taxes
and
dues
to
their
sovereign
and
to
claim
for
the
pope
a
right
to
dispose
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
philip
provoked
by
this
held
meetings
of
what
were
called
the
of
france
clergy
nobles
and
commons
and
charged
the
pope
with
all
sorts
of
vices
and
crimes
even
with
disbelief
of
the
christian
faith
the
estates
declared
against
the
pope
claims
and
when
boniface
summoned
a
council
of
bishops
from
all
countries
to
meet
at
rome
philip
forbade
the
french
bishops
to
obey
and
all
but
a
few
stayed
away
one
of
the
pope
letters
to
the
king
was
cut
in
pieces
and
thrown
into
the
fire
and
the
burning
was
proclaimed
through
the
streets
of
paris
with
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
the
pope
was
greatly
enraged
by
philip
conduct
he
prepared
a
bull
by
which
the
king
was
declared
to
be
excommunicated
and
to
be
deprived
of
his
crown
and
it
was
intended
to
publish
this
bull
on
the
of
september
at
anagni
boniface
native
place
where
he
was
spending
the
summer
months
but
on
the
day
before
something
took
place
which
hindered
the
carrying
out
of
the
pope
design
early
in
his
reign
boniface
had
been
engaged
in
a
quarrel
with
the
colonnas
one
of
the
most
powerful
among
the
great
princely
families
of
rome
he
had
persecuted
them
bitterly
had
deprived
them
of
their
estates
and
honours
and
after
having
got
possession
of
a
fortress
belonging
to
them
by
treachery
he
had
caused
it
to
be
utterly
destroyed
and
the
ground
on
which
it
stood
to
be
ploughed
up
and
sown
with
salt
the
colonnas
were
scattered
in
all
quarters
and
it
is
said
that
one
of
them
named
james
who
was
a
very
rough
and
violent
man
had
been
for
a
time
in
captivity
among
pirates
and
was
delivered
from
this
condition
by
the
money
of
the
french
king
who
wished
to
make
use
of
him
on
the
of
september
this
james
colonna
with
other
persons
in
king
philip
service
appeared
at
anagni
with
an
armed
force
and
made
their
way
to
the
pope
palace
boniface
sent
to
ask
what
they
wanted
and
in
answer
they
required
that
he
should
give
up
his
office
should
restore
the
colonnas
to
all
that
they
had
lost
and
should
put
himself
into
the
hands
of
james
colonna
on
his
refusal
they
set
fire
to
the
doors
of
a
church
which
adjoined
the
palace
and
rushed
in
through
the
flames
boniface
heard
the
forcing
of
the
doors
which
were
between
them
and
the
room
in
which
he
was
and
as
one
door
after
another
gave
way
with
a
crash
he
declared
himself
resolved
to
die
as
became
a
pope
he
put
on
the
mantle
of
his
office
with
the
imperial
crown
which
bore
the
name
of
constantine
he
grasped
his
pastoral
staff
in
one
hand
and
the
keys
of
peter
in
the
other
and
taking
his
seat
on
his
throne
he
awaited
the
approach
of
his
enemies
on
entering
the
room
even
these
rude
and
furious
men
were
awed
for
a
moment
by
his
venerable
and
dauntless
look
but
james
colonna
quickly
overcoming
this
feeling
required
him
to
resign
the
papacy
behold
my
neck
and
my
head
answered
boniface
if
i
have
been
betrayed
like
christ
i
am
ready
to
die
like
christ
vicar
colonna
savagely
dragged
him
from
the
throne
and
is
said
to
have
struck
him
on
the
face
with
his
mailed
hand
so
as
to
draw
blood
others
of
the
party
poured
forth
torrents
of
reproaches
the
pope
was
hurried
into
the
streets
was
paraded
about
the
town
on
a
vicious
horse
with
his
face
toward
the
tail
and
was
then
thrown
into
prison
while
the
ruffians
plundered
the
palaces
and
churches
of
anagni
the
citizens
in
their
surprise
and
alarm
had
allowed
these
things
to
pass
without
any
check
but
two
days
later
they
took
heart
and
with
the
help
of
some
neighbours
got
the
better
of
the
pope
enemies
and
delivered
him
from
prison
he
was
brought
out
on
a
balcony
in
the
where
his
appearance
raised
the
pity
of
all
for
he
had
tasted
nothing
since
his
arrest
the
old
man
begged
that
some
good
woman
would
save
him
from
dying
by
hunger
on
this
the
crowd
burst
out
into
cries
of
life
to
you
holy
father
and
immediately
people
hurried
away
in
all
directions
and
came
back
with
abundance
of
food
and
drink
for
his
relief
the
pope
spoke
kindly
to
all
who
were
near
him
and
pronounced
forgiveness
of
all
but
those
who
had
plundered
the
church
boniface
was
soon
afterwards
removed
to
rome
but
the
sufferings
which
he
had
gone
through
had
been
too
much
for
a
man
almost
ninety
years
old
to
bear
his
mind
seems
to
have
given
way
and
there
are
terrible
stories
although
we
can
not
be
sure
that
they
are
true
about
the
manner
of
his
death
which
took
place
within
a
few
days
after
he
reached
the
city
it
was
said
of
him
he
entered
like
a
fox
he
reigned
like
a
lion
he
went
out
like
a
dog
and
although
this
saying
was
no
doubt
made
up
after
his
end
it
was
commonly
believed
to
have
been
a
prophecy
uttered
by
old
pope
celestine
to
whom
he
had
behaved
so
treacherously
and
so
harshly
chapter
xvii
the
popes
at
the
ruin
of
the
templars
part
i
the
next
pope
benedict
wished
to
do
away
with
the
effects
of
boniface
pride
and
ambition
and
especially
to
soothe
the
king
of
france
whom
boniface
had
so
greatly
provoked
but
benedict
died
within
about
seven
months
june
after
his
election
and
it
was
not
easy
to
fill
up
his
place
at
last
about
a
year
after
benedict
death
june
bertrand
du
got
archbishop
of
bordeaux
was
chosen
it
was
said
that
he
had
held
a
secret
meeting
with
king
philip
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
and
that
in
order
to
get
the
king
help
towards
his
election
he
bound
himself
to
do
five
things
which
philip
named
and
also
a
sixth
thing
which
was
not
to
be
spoken
of
until
the
time
should
come
for
performing
it
but
this
story
seems
to
have
been
made
up
because
the
pope
was
seen
to
follow
philip
wishes
in
a
way
that
people
could
not
understand
except
by
supposing
that
he
had
bound
himself
by
some
special
bargain
for
some
years
clement
as
he
was
called
lived
at
the
cost
of
french
cathedrals
and
monasteries
which
he
visited
one
after
another
and
then
he
settled
at
avignon
a
city
on
the
rhone
where
he
and
his
successors
lived
for
seventy
years
about
the
same
length
of
time
that
the
jews
spent
as
captives
in
babylon
hence
this
stay
of
the
popes
at
avignon
has
sometimes
been
spoken
of
as
the
babylonian
captivity
of
the
church
although
there
were
some
good
popes
in
the
course
of
those
seventy
years
the
court
of
avignon
was
usually
full
of
luxury
and
vice
and
the
government
of
the
church
grew
more
and
more
corrupt
philip
the
fair
was
not
content
with
having
brought
boniface
to
his
end
but
wished
to
persecute
and
disgrace
his
memory
he
caused
all
sorts
of
shocking
charges
to
be
brought
against
the
dead
pope
and
demanded
that
he
should
be
condemned
as
a
heretic
and
that
his
body
should
be
taken
up
and
burnt
by
these
demands
pope
clement
was
thrown
into
great
distress
he
was
afraid
to
offend
philip
and
at
the
same
time
he
wished
to
save
the
memory
of
boniface
for
if
a
pope
were
to
be
condemned
in
the
way
in
which
philip
wished
it
must
tell
against
the
papacy
altogether
and
besides
this
if
boniface
had
not
been
a
lawful
pope
as
philip
and
his
party
said
the
cardinals
whom
he
had
appointed
were
not
lawful
cardinals
and
clement
who
had
been
partly
chosen
by
their
votes
could
have
no
right
to
the
popedom
he
was
therefore
willing
to
do
much
in
order
to
clear
boniface
memory
and
philip
craftily
managed
to
get
the
pope
help
in
another
matter
on
condition
that
the
charges
against
boniface
should
not
be
pressed
this
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
secret
article
which
we
have
heard
of
in
the
story
of
the
meeting
in
the
forest
part
ii
i
have
already
mentioned
the
order
of
knights
templars
which
was
formed
in
the
holy
land
soon
after
the
first
crusade
these
soldiers
of
the
cross
showed
at
all
times
a
courage
worthy
of
their
profession
but
they
also
showed
faults
which
were
beyond
all
question
as
they
grew
rich
they
grew
proud
and
from
having
at
first
been
very
strict
in
their
way
of
living
it
was
believed
that
they
had
fallen
into
habits
of
luxury
they
despised
all
men
outside
of
their
own
order
they
showed
no
respect
for
the
kings
of
jerusalem
or
for
the
patriarchs
and
were
indeed
continually
quarrelling
with
them

this
time
the
number
of
the
templar
knights
was
about
fifteen
thousand
the
finest
soldiers
in
the
world
and
the
whole
number
of
persons
attached
to
the
order
was
not
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
about
half
of
these
were
frenchmen
and
all
the
masters
or
heads
of
the
order
had
been
french
but
although
the
charges
which
i
have
mentioned
were
enough
to
make
the
templars
generally
disliked
they
were
not
the
worst
charges
against
them
it
was
said
that
during
the
latter
part
of
their
time
in
the
holy
land
they
had
grown
friendly
with
the
unbelievers
whom
they
were
bound
to
oppose
in
arms
to
the
uttermost
that
from
such
company
they
had
taken
up
opinions
contrary
to
the
christian
faith
and
vices
which
were
altogether
against
their
duty
as
soldiers
of
the
cross
or
as
christians
at
all
that
they
practised
magic
and
unholy
rites
that
when
any
one
was
admitted
into
the
order
he
was
required
to
deny
christ
to
spit
on
the
cross
and
trample
on
it
and
to
worship
an
idol
called
baphomet
a
name
which
seems
to
have
meant
the
false
prophet
mahomet
philip
the
fair
was
always
in
need
of
money
for
carrying
on
his
schemes
and
at
one
time
when
some
tricks
which
he
had
played
on
the
coin
of
his
kingdom
had
provoked
the
people
of
paris
to
rise
against
him
he
took
refuge
in
the
house
of
the
templars
there
this
house
covered
a
vast
space
of
ground
with
its
buildings
and
was
finer
and
stronger
than
the
royal
palace
and
it
was
perhaps
the
sight
which
philip
then
got
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
templars
that
led
him
to
attack
them
in
the
hope
of
getting
their
property
into
his
own
hands
philip
set
about
this
design
very
craftily
he
invited
the
masters
of
the
templars
and
of
the
hospitallers
whom
you
will
remember
as
the
other
great
military
order
into
france
as
if
he
wished
to
consult
them
about
a
crusade
the
master
of
the
hospital
was
unable
to
obey
the
summons
but
the
master
of
the
temple
james
de
molay
who
had
been
in
the
order
more
than
forty
years
appeared
with
a
train
so
splendid
that
philip
greed
was
still
more
whetted
by
the
sight
of
it
the
master
was
received
with
great
honour
but
in
the
meantime
orders
were
secretly
sent
to
the
king
officers
all
over
the
kingdom
who
were
forbidden
to
open
them
before
a
certain
day
and
when
these
orders
were
opened
they
were
found
to
require
that
the
templars
should
everywhere
be
seized
and
imprisoned
without
delay
accordingly
at
the
dawn
of
the
following
day
the
templars
all
over
france
who
had
had
no
warning
and
felt
no
suspicion
were
suddenly
made
prisoners
without
being
able
to
resist
see
page
next
day
which
was
sunday
philip
set
friars
and
others
to
preach
against
the
templars
in
all
the
churches
of
paris
and
inquiries
were
afterwards
carried
on
by
bishops
and
other
judges
as
to
the
truth
of
the
charges
against
them
while
the
trials
were
going
on
the
templars
were
very
hardly
used
all
that
they
had
was
taken
away
from
them
so
that
they
were
in
grievous
distress
they
were
kept
in
dungeons
were
loaded
with
chains
ill
fed
and
ill
cared
for
in
all
ways
they
were
examined
by
tortures
which
were
so
severe
that
many
of
them
were
brought
by
the
very
pain
to
confess
everything
that
they
were
charged
with
although
they
afterwards
said
that
they
had
been
driven
by
their
sufferings
to
own
things
of
which
they
were
not
at
all
guilty
many
were
burnt
in
companies
from
time
to
time
at
one
time
no
fewer
than
were
burnt
together
at
paris
and
such
cruelties
struck
terror
into
the
rest
some
of
the
templars
on
their
trials
told
strange
stories
they
said
for
instance
that
some
men
on
being
admitted
to
the
order
were
suddenly
changed
as
if
they
had
been
made
to
share
in
some
fearful
secrets
that
from
having
been
jovial
and
full
of
life
delighting
in
horses
and
hounds
and
hawks
they
seemed
to
be
weighed
down
by
a
deep
sadness
under
which
they
pined
away
it
is
not
easy
to
say
what
is
to
be
made
of
all
these
stories
as
to
the
ceremonies
used
at
admitting
members
it
seems
likely
enough
that
the
templars
may
have
used
some
things
which
looked
strange
and
shocking
but
which
really
meant
no
harm
and
were
properly
to
be
understood
as
figures
or
acted
parables
the
pope
seems
too
not
to
have
known
what
to
make
of
the
case
but
as
we
have
seen
he
had
bound
himself
to
serve
king
philip
in
the
matter
of
the
templars
in
order
that
pope
boniface
memory
might
be
spared
at
a
great
council
held
under
clement
at
vienne
in
it
was
decreed
that
the
order
of
the
temple
should
be
dissolved
yet
it
was
not
said
that
the
templars
had
been
found
guilty
of
the
charges
against
them
and
the
question
of
their
guilt
or
innocence
remains
to
puzzle
us
as
it
puzzled
the
council
of
vienne
the
master
of
the
temple
james
de
molay
was
kept
in
prison
six
years
and
a
half
and
was
often
examined
at
last
he
and
three
other
great
officers
of
the
order
were
condemned
to
imprisonment
for
life
and
were
brought
forward
on
a
platform
set
up
in
front
of
the
cathedral
of
paris
that
their
sentence
might
be
published
a
cardinal
began
to
read
out
their
confessions
but
molay
broke
in
denying
and
disavowing
what
he
had
formerly
said
and
declaring
himself
worthy
to
die
for
having
made
false
confessions
through
fear
of
death
and
in
order
to
please
the
king
one
of
his
companions
took
part
with
him
in
this
but
the
other
two
broken
down
in
body
and
in
spirit
by
their
long
confinement
had
not
the
courage
to
join
them
philip
on
hearing
what
had
taken
place
gave
orders
that
james
de
molay
and
the
other
who
took
part
with
him
should
be
burnt
without
delay
and
on
the
same
day
they
were
led
forth
to
death
on
a
little
island
in
the
river
seine
which
runs
through
paris
while
philip
from
the
bank
watched
their
sufferings
molay
begged
that
his
hands
might
be
unbound
and
as
the
flames
rose
around
him
and
his
companion
they
firmly
declared
the
soundness
of
their
faith
and
the
innocence
of
the
order
within
nine
months
after
this
philip
died
at
the
age
of
and
within
a
few
years
his
three
sons
of
whom
each
had
in
turn
been
king
of
france
were
all
dead
philip
family
was
at
an
end
and
the
crown
passed
to
one
of
his
nephews
and
while
the
clergy
supposed
those
misfortunes
to
be
the
punishment
of
philip
doings
against
pope
boniface
the
people
in
general
regarded
them
as
brought
on
by
his
persecution
of
the
templars
it
is
not
for
us
to
pass
such
judgments
at
all
but
i
mention
these
things
in
order
to
show
the
feelings
with
which
philip
actions
and
his
calamities
were
viewed
by
the
people
of
his
own
time
in
other
countries
such
as
england
scotland
ireland
germany
and
spain
the
templars
were
arrested
and
brought
to
trial
and
rightly
or
wrongly
the
order
was
dissolved
its
members
were
left
to
find
some
other
kind
of
life
and
its
property
was
made
over
to
the
order
of
the
hospital
or
to
some
other
military
order
in
france
however
philip
contrived
to
lay
his
hands
on
so
much
that
the
hospitallers
for
a
time
were
rather
made
poorer
than
richer
by
this
addition
to
their
possessions
chapter
xviii
the
popes
at
avignon
pope
clement
died
a
few
months
before
philip
april
and
was
succeeded
by
john
a
frenchman
who
was
seventy
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
election
and
lived
to
ninety
the
most
remarkable
thing
in
john
papacy
was
his
quarrel
with
lewis
of
bavaria
who
had
been
chosen
emperor
by
some
of
the
electors
while
others
voted
for
frederick
of
austria
for
the
choice
of
an
emperor
or
rather
of
a
king
of
the
romans
had
by
this
time
fallen
into
the
hands
of
seven
german
princes
of
whom
four
were
laymen
and
three
were
the
archbishops
of
mentz
cologne
and
treves
and
hence
it
is
that
at
a
later
time
we
find
that
some
german
princes
had
for
their
title
as
the
electors
of
hanover
and
the
electors
of
brandenburg
and
even
that
the
three
clerical
electors
were
more
commonly
called
electors
than
archbishops
it
is
not
exactly
known
when
this
way
of
choosing
the
kings
of
the
romans
came
in
but
as
i
have
said
it
was
quite
settled
before
the
time
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
there
was
then
a
disputed
election
between
lewis
of
bavaria
and
frederick
of
austria
and
pope
john
was
well
pleased
to
stand
by
and
watch
their
quarrel
so
long
as
they
only
weakened
each
other
without
coming
to
any
settlement
of
the
question
but
when
lewis
had
got
the
better
of
frederick
then
john
stepped
in
and
told
him
that
it
was
for
the
pope
to
judge
in
such
a
case
which
of
the
two
ought
to
be
king
of
the
romans
and
he
forbade
all
people
to
obey
lewis
as
king
and
declared
that
whatever
he
might
have
done
as
king
should
be
of
no
effect
but
people
had
become
used
to
such
sentences
so
that
they
would
not
mind
them
unless
they
thought
them
just
and
thus
pope
thunder
was
very
little
heeded
although
he
excommunicated
lewis
the
sentence
had
no
effect
and
by
this
and
other
things
especially
a
quarrel
which
john
had
with
a
part
of
the
franciscan
order
people
were
set
on
inquiring
into
the
rights
of
the
papacy
in
a
way
which
was
quite
new
so
that
their
thoughts
took
a
direction
which
was
very
dangerous
to
the
power
of
the
popes
lewis
answered
the
pope
by
setting
up
an
antipope
against
him
but
this
was
a
thing
which
had
never
succeeded
and
so
it
was
that
john
rival
was
obliged
to
submit
and
in
token
of
the
humblest
repentance
appeared
with
a
rope
round
his
neck
at
avignon
where
the
rest
of
his
life
was
spent
in
confinement
the
pope
on
his
part
set
up
a
rival
emperor
charles
of
moravia
son
of
that
blind
king
john
of
bohemia
whose
death
at
the
battle
of
cressy
is
known
to
us
from
the
history
of
england
but
charles
found
little
support
in
germany
so
long
as
lewis
was
alive
the
next
pope
benedict
xii
although
of
himself
he
would
have
wished
to
make
peace
with
lewis
found
himself
prevented
from
doing
so
by
the
king
of
france
and
his
successor
clement
vi
who
had
once
been
tutor
to
charles
of
moravia
strongly
supported
his
old
pupil
lewis
died
excommunicate
in
and
was
the
last
emperor
who
had
to
bear
that
sentence
but
although
he
suffered
much
on
account
of
it
he
had
yet
kept
his
title
of
emperor
as
long
as
he
lived
and
he
left
a
strong
party
of
supporters
who
were
able
to
make
good
terms
for
themselves
before
charles
was
allowed
to
take
peaceable
possession
of
the
empire
chapter
xix
religious
sects
and
parties
while
the
popes
were
thus
trying
to
lord
it
over
all
men
from
the
emperor
downwards
there
were
many
who
hated
their
doctrines
and
would
not
allow
their
authority
the
albigenses
and
waldenses
although
persecuted
as
we
have
seen
still
remained
in
great
numbers
and
held
the
opinions
which
had
drawn
so
much
suffering
on
them
the
albigenses
indeed
were
but
a
part
of
a
greater
body
the
who
were
spread
through
many
countries
and
had
an
understanding
and
fellowship
with
each
other
which
were
kept
up
by
secret
means
and
there
were
other
sects
of
which
it
need
only
be
said
here
that
in
general
their
opinions
were
very
wild
and
strange
and
very
unlike
not
only
to
the
papal
doctrines
but
to
the
christianity
of
the
bible
and
of
the
early
church
whenever
any
of
the
clergy
from
the
pope
downwards
gave
an
occasion
by
pride
or
ambition
or
worldly
living
or
neglect
of
duty
or
any
other
fault
these
sects
took
care
to
speak
of
the
whole
church
as
having
fallen
from
the
faith
and
to
gain
converts
for
themselves
by
pointing
out
the
blemishes
which
were
allowed
in
it
on
the
other
hand
as
i
have
mentioned
the
inquisition
was
set
on
foot
for
the
discovery
and
punishment
of
such
doctrines
as
the
roman
church
condemned
and
it
was
worked
with
a
secrecy
an
injustice
and
a
cruelty
which
made
men
quake
with
fear
wherever
it
was
established
it
is
a
comfort
to
know
that
in
the
british
islands
this
hateful
kind
of
tyranny
never
found
a
footing
page
there
were
large
numbers
of
persons
called
mystics
who
thought
to
draw
near
to
god
and
to
give
up
their
own
will
to
his
will
in
a
way
beyond
what
ordinary
believers
could
understand
among
these
was
a
society
which
called
itself
the
of
and
these
friends
belonged
to
the
church
at
the
same
time
that
they
had
this
closer
and
more
secret
tie
of
union
among
themselves
there
is
a
very
curious
story
how
john
tauler
a
dominican
friar
of
strasburg
was
converted
by
the
chief
of
this
party
nicolas
of
basel
tauler
had
gained
great
fame
as
a
preacher
and
had
reached
the
age
of
when
nicolas
who
had
been
one
of
his
hearers
visited
him
and
convinced
him
that
he
was
nothing
better
than
a
pharisee
in
obedience
to
the
direction
of
nicolas
tauler
shut
himself
up
for
two
years
without
preaching
or
doing
any
other
work
as
a
clergyman
and
even
without
studying
when
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
came
forth
again
to
the
world
and
first
tried
to
preach
he
burst
into
tears
and
quite
broke
down
but
on
a
second
trial
it
was
found
that
he
preached
in
a
new
style
and
with
vastly
more
of
warmth
and
of
effect
than
he
had
ever
done
before
tauler
was
born
in
and
died
in
in
these
times
many
were
very
fond
of
trying
to
make
out
things
to
come
from
the
prophecies
of
the
old
testament
and
of
the
revelation
and
some
people
of
both
sexes
supposed
themselves
to
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
in
seasons
of
great
public
distress
multitudes
would
break
out
into
some
wild
sort
of
religious
display
which
for
a
time
carried
everything
before
it
and
seemed
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
although
the
wiser
people
looked
on
it
with
distrust
but
after
a
while
it
passed
away
leaving
those
who
had
taken
part
in
it
rather
worse
than
better
than
before
among
the
outbreaks
of
this
kind
was
that
of
the
which
showed
itself
several
times
in
various
places
the
first
appearance
of
it
was
in
when
it
began
at
perugia
in
the
middle
of
italy
and
spread
both
southwards
to
rome
and
northwards
to
france
hungary
and
poland
in
every
city
large
companies
of
men
women
and
children
moved
about
the
streets
with
their
faces
covered
but
their
bodies
naked
down
to
the
waist
they
tossed
their
limbs
wildly
they
dashed
themselves
down
on
the
ground
in
mud
or
snow
and
cruelly
or
flogged
themselves
with
whips
while
they
shouted
out
shrieks
and
prayers
for
mercy
and
pardon
again
after
a
terrible
plague
called
the
black
death
which
raged
from
sicily
to
greenland
about
parties
of
flagellants
went
about
singing
and
scourging
themselves
whenever
the
sufferings
were
mentioned
in
their
hymns
they
threw
themselves
on
the
ground
like
logs
of
wood
with
their
arms
stretched
out
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
and
remained
prostrate
in
prayer
until
a
signal
was
given
them
to
rise
see
page
these
movements
seemed
to
do
good
at
first
by
reconciling
enemies
and
by
forcing
the
thoughts

john
wyclif
born
about
died
at
this
time
arose
a
reformer
of
a
different
kind
from
any
of
those
who
had
gone
before
him
he
was
a
yorkshireman
named
john
wyclif
who
had
been
educated
at
oxford
and
had
become
famous
there
as
a
teacher
of
philosophy
before
he
began
to
show
any
difference
of
opinions
from
those
which
were
common
in
the
church
ever
since
the
time
when
king
john
disgusted
his
people
by
his
shameful
submission
to
the
pope
there
had
been
a
strong
feeling
against
the
papacy
in
england
and
it
had
been
provoked
more
and
more
partly
because
the
popes
were
always
drawing
money
from
this
country
and
thrusting
foreigners
into
the
richer
places
of
the
english
church
these
foreigners
squeezed
all
that
they
could
out
of
their
parishes
or
offices
in
england
but
they
never
went
near
them
and
would
have
been
unable
to
do
much
good
if
they
had
gone
because
they
did
not
understand
the
english
language
and
another
complaint
was
that
while
the
popes
lived
at
avignon
they
were
so
much
in
the
hands
of
their
neighbours
the
kings
of
france
that
the
english
had
no
chance
of
fair
play
if
any
question
arose
between
the
two
nations
and
the
pope
could
make
himself
the
judge
and
thus
the
english
had
been
made
ready
enough
to
give
a
hearing
to
any
one
who
might
teach
them
that
the
popes
had
no
right
to
the
power
which
they
claimed
page
there
had
always
been
a
great
unwillingness
to
pay
the
tribute
which
king
john
had
promised
to
the
roman
see
if
the
king
was
weak
he
paid
it
if
he
was
strong
he
was
more
likely
to
refuse
it
and
thus
it
was
that
the
money
had
been
refused
by
edward
paid
by
edward
and
again
refused
by
edward
whom
pope
urban
in
asked
to
pay
up
for
years
at
once
in
this
case
wyclif
took
the
side
of
his
king
and
maintained
that
the
tribute
was
not
rightly
due
to
the
pope
and
from
this
he
went
on
to
attack
the
corruptions
of
the
church
in
general
he
set
himself
against
the
begging
friars
who
had
come
to
great
power
worming
themselves
in
everywhere
so
that
they
had
brought
most
of
the
poorer
people
to
look
only
to
them
as
spiritual
guides
and
to
think
nothing
of
the
parish
clergy
in
order
to
oppose
the
friars
wyclif
sent
about
the
country
a
set
of
men
whom
he
called
these
were
very
like
the
friars
in
their
rough
dress
and
simple
manner
of
living
but
taught
more
according
to
a
plain
understanding
of
the
scriptures
than
to
the
doctrines
of
the
roman
church
it
is
said
that
once
when
wyclif
was
very
ill
and
was
supposed
to
be
dying
some
friars
went
to
him
in
the
hope
of
getting
him
to
confess
that
he
repented
of
what
he
had
spoken
and
written
and
done
against
them
but
wyclif
gathering
all
his
strength
rose
up
in
his
bed
and
said
in
words
which
were
partly
taken
from
the
psalm
i
shall
not
die
but
live
and
declare
the
evil
deeds
of
the
friars
he
was
several
times
brought
before
assemblies
of
bishops
and
clergy
to
answer
for
his
opinions
but
he
found
powerful
friends
to
protect
him
and
always
came
off
without
hurt
it
was
in
wyclif
time
that
the
rebellion
of
wat
tyler
and
jack
straw
broke
out
as
we
read
in
the
history
of
england
but
although
wyclif
enemies
would
have
been
very
glad
to
lay
some
of
the
blame
of
it
at
his
door
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
any
way
in
those
days
almost
all
books
were
written
in
latin
so
that
none
but
learned
people
could
read
them
but
wyclif
although
he
wrote
some
books
in
latin
for
the
learned
took
to
writing
other
books
in
good
plain
english
such
as
every
one
could
understand
and
thus
his
opinions
became
known
to
people
of
all
classes
but
the
greatest
thing
that
he
did
was
the
translation
of
the
bible
into
english
the
roman
church
would
not
allow
the
scriptures
to
be
turned
into
the
language
of
the
country
but
wished
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
it
for
those
who
could
read
latin
and
expected
the
common
people
to
content
themselves
with
what
the
church
taught
but
wyclif
with
others
who
worked
under
him
translated
the
whole
bible
into
english
so
that
all
might
understand
it
we
must
remember
however
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
printing
in
his
days
so
that
every
single
book
had
to
be
written
with
the
pen
and
of
course
books
were
still
very
dear
and
could
not
be
at
all
common
it
is
said
that
pope
urban
summoned
wyclif
to
appear
before
him
at
rome
but
wyclif
who
was
old
and
had
been
very
ill
excused
himself
from
going
and
soon
after
this
he
died
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
wyclif
had
many
notions
which
we
can
not
agree
with
and
we
have
reason
to
thank
god
good
providence
that
the
reform
of
the
church
was
not
carried
out
by
him
but
at
a
later
time
and
in
a
more
moderate
and
sounder
way
than
he
would
have
chosen
but
we
must
honour
him
as
one
who
saw
the
crying
evils
of
the
roman
church
and
honestly
tried
to
cure
them
wyclif
followers
were
called
i
believe
from
their
habit
of
or
chanting
to
themselves
after
his
death
they
went
much
farther
than
he
had
done
and
some
of
them
grew
very
wild
in
their
opinions
so
that
they
would
not
only
have
made
strange
changes
in
religious
doctrine
but
would
have
upset
the
government
of
kingdoms
against
them
a
law
was
made
by
which
persons
who
differed
from
the
doctrines
of
the
roman
church
were
sentenced
to
be
burnt
under
the
name
of
heretics
and
many
lollards
suffered
in
consequence
the
most
famous
of
these
was
sir
john
oldcastle
lord
cobham
a
brave
but
rather
and
violent
soldier
who
was
suspected
of
meaning
to
get
up
a
rebellion
for
this
and
his
religious
opinions
together
he
was
burnt
in
smithfield
which
was
then
just
outside
london
the
same
place
where
at
a
later
time
many
suffered
for
their
religion
in
the
reigns
of
henry
viii
and
mary
chapter
xxi
the
popes
return
to
rome
while
the
popes
lived
at
avignon
rome
suffered
very
much
from
their
absence
there
was
nothing
like
a
regular
government
the
great
roman
families
such
as
the
colonnas
whom
i
have
mentioned
in
speaking
of
boniface
viii
carried
on
their
quarrels
with
each
other
and
no
one
attempted
or
was
strong
enough
to
check
them
murders
robberies
and
violences
of
all
sorts
were
common
the
vast
and
noble
buildings
which
had
remained
from
ancient
times
were
neglected
the
churches
and
palaces
fell
to
decay
even
the
manners
of
the
romans
became
rough
and
rude
from
the
want
of
anybody
to
teach
them
better
and
to
show
them
an
example
and
not
only
rome
but
all
italy
missed
the
pope
presence
the
princes
carried
on
their
wars
by
means
of
hired
bands
of
soldiers
who
were
mostly
strangers
from
beyond
the
alps
these
bands
hired
out
their
services
to
any
one
who
would
pay
enough
and
although
they
were
faithful
to
each
employer
for
the
time
that
was
agreed
on
they
were
ready
at
the
end
of
that
time
to
engage
themselves
for
money
to
one
who
might
be
their
late
master
enemy
the
most
famous
captain
of
such
hireling
soldiers
was
sir
john
hawkwood
an
englishman
who
is
commonly
said
to
have
been
a
tailor
in
london
before
he
took
to
arms
but
this
i
believe
to
be
a
mistake
he
fought
for
many
years
in
italy
and
a
picture
of
him
on
horseback
which
serves
for
his
monument
is
still
to
be
seen
in
florence
cathedral
the
romans
again
and
again
entreated
the
popes
to
come
back
to
their
city
the
chief
poet
and
writer
of
the
age
petrarch
urged
them
both
in
verse
and
in
prose
to
return
but
the
cardinals
who
at
this
time
were
mostly
frenchmen
had
grown
so
used
to
the
pleasures
of
avignon
that
they
did
all
they
could
to
keep
the
popes
there
at
length
in
urban
made
his
way
back
to
rome
where
the
emperors
both
of
the
east
and
of
the
west
met
to
do
him
honour
but
after
a
short
stay
in
italy
he
returned
to
avignon
where
he
soon
after
died
his
successor
gregory
however
was
more
resolute
and
removed
the
papacy
to
rome
in
and
this
was
the
end
of
what
was
styled
the
seventy
years
captivity
in
babylon
see
page
chapter
xxii
the
great
schism
gregory
xi
died
in
and
the
choice
of
a
successor
to
him
was
no
easy
matter
the
romans
were
bent
on
having
a
countryman
of
their
own
that
they
might
be
sure
of
his
continuing
to
live
among
them
they
guarded
the
gates
they
brought
into
the
city
a
number
of
rough
and
people
from
the
hills
around
to
terrify
the
cardinals
and
when
these
were
shut
up
for
the
election
the
mob
surrounded
the
palace
in
which
they
were
with
cries
of
we
will
have
a
roman
or
at
least
an
italian
day
and
night
their
shouts
were
kept
up
with
a
frightful
din
of
other
kinds
they
broke
into
the
pope
cellars
got
drunk
on
the
wine
and
were
thus
made
more
furious
than
before
at
length
the
cardinals
driven
to
extreme
terror
made
choice
of
bartholomew
prignano
archbishop
of
bari
in
south
italy
who
was
not
one
of
their
own
number
it
is
certain
that
he
was
not
chosen
freely
but
under
fear
of
the
noise
and
threats
of
the
roman
mob
but
all
the
forms
which
follow
after
the
election
of
a
pope
such
as
that
of
coronation
were
regularly
gone
through
and
the
cardinals
seem
to
have
given
their
approval
of
the
choice
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
not
well
draw
back
afterwards
but
urban
vi
as
the
new
pope
called
himself
although
he
had
until
then
been
much
esteemed
as
a
pious
and
modest
man
seems
to
have
lost
his
head
on
being
raised
to
his
new
office
he
held
himself
vastly
above
the
cardinals
wishing
to
reform
them
violently
and
to
lord
it
over
them
in
a
style
which
they
had
not
been
used
to
by
such
conduct
he
provoked
them
to
oppose
him
they
objected
that
he
had
not
been
freely
chosen
and
also
that
he
was
not
in
his
right
mind
and
a
party
of
them
met
at
fondi
and
chose
another
pope
clement
a
frenchman
who
settled
at
avignon
thus
began
what
is
called
the
great
schism
of
the
west
there
were
now
two
rival
popes
one
of
them
having
his
court
at
rome
and
the
other
at
avignon
and
the
kingdoms
of
europe
were
divided
between
the
two
the
cost
of
keeping
up
two
courts
weighed
heavily
on
the
christians
of
the
west
and
all
sorts
of
tricks
were
used
to
squeeze
out
fees
and
money
on
all
possible
occasions
as
an
instance
of
this
i
may
mention
that
boniface
one
of
the
roman
line
of
popes
celebrated
two
jubilees
with
only
ten
years
between
them
although
in
boniface
viii
time
it
had
been
supposed
that
the
jubilee
was
to
come
only
once
in
a
hundred
years
the
princes
of
europe
were
scandalized
by
this
division
and
often
tried
to
heal
it
but
in
vain
for
the
popes
although
they
professed
to
desire
such
a
thing
were
generally
far
from
hearty
in
saying
so
at
length
it
seemed
as
if
the
breach
were
to
be
healed
by
a
council
held
at
pisa
in
which
set
aside
both
the
rivals
and
elected
a
new
pope
alexander
but
it
was
found
that
the
two
old
claimants
would
not
give
way
and
thus
the
council
of
pisa
in
trying
to
cure
the
evil
of
having
two
popes
had
saddled
the
church
with
a
third
alexander
did
not
hold
the
papacy
quite
eleven
months
june
to
may
he
had
fallen
wholly
under
the
power
of
a
cardinal
named
balthasar
cossa
and
this
cardinal
was
chosen
to
succeed
him
under
the
name
of
john
xxiii
john
was
one
of
the
worst
men
who
ever
held
the
papacy
it
is
said
that
he
had
been
a
pirate
and
that
from
this
he
had
got
the
habit
of
waking
all
night
and
sleeping
by
day
he
had
been
governor
of
bologna
where
he
had
indulged
himself
to
the
full
in
cruelty
greed
and
other
vices
he
was
even
suspected
of
having
poisoned
alexander
and
although
he
must
no
doubt
have
been
a
very
clever
man
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
how
the
other
cardinals
can
have
chosen
one
who
was
so
notoriously
wicked
to
the
papacy
chapter
xxiii
john
huss
it
would
seem
that
after
a
time
wyclif
opinions
almost
died
out
in
england
but
meanwhile
they
or
opinions
very
like
them
were
eagerly
taken
up
in
bohemia
if
we
look
at
the
map
of
europe
we
might
think
that
no
country
was
less
likely
than
bohemia
to
have
anything
to
do
with
england
for
it
lies
in
the
midst
of
other
countries
far
away
from
all
seas
and
with
no
harbours
to
which
english
ships
could
make
their
way
and
besides
this
the
people
are
of
a
different
race
from
any
that
have
ever
settled
in
this
country
or
have
helped
to
make
the
english
nation
and
their
language
has
no
likeness
to
ours
but
it
so
happened
that
richard
ii
of
england
married
the
princess
anne
granddaughter
of
the
blind
king
who
fell
at
cressy
and
daughter
of
the
emperor
charles
who
usually
lived
in
bohemia
and
when
queen
anne
of
england
died
and
the
bohemian
ladies
and
servants
of
her
court
went
back
to
their
own
country
they
took
with
them
some
of
wyclif
writings
which
were
readily
welcomed
there
for
some
of
the
bohemian
clergy
had
already
begun
a
reform
in
the
church
and
wyclif
name
was
well
known
on
account
of
his
writings
of
another
kind
among
those
who
thus
became
acquainted
with
wyclif
opinions
was
a
young
man
named
john
huss
he
had
been
an
admirer
of
philosophical
works
but
when
he
first
met
with
his
reforming
books
he
was
so
little
taken
with
them
that
he
wished
they
were
thrown
into
the
moldau
the
river
which
runs
through
prague
the
chief
city
of
bohemia
but
huss
soon
came
to
think
differently
and
heartily
took
up
almost
all
wyclif
doctrines
huss
made
many
enemies
among
the
clergy
by
attacking
their
faults
from
the
pulpit
of
a
chapel
called
bethlehem
where
he
was
preacher
he
was
however
still
so
far
in
favour
with
the
archbishop
of
prague
that
he
was
employed
by
him
together
with
some
others
to
inquire
into
a
pretended
miracle
which
drew
crowds
of
pilgrims
to
seek
for
cures
at
a
place
called
wilsnack
in
the
north
of
germany
but
he
afterwards
fell
out
of
favour
with
the
archbishop
who
had
appointed
him
to
this
work
and
he
was
still
less
liked
by
later
archbishops
from
time
to
time
some
doctrines
which
were
said
to
be
wyclif
were
condemned
at
prague
huss
usually
declared
that
wyclif
had
been
wrongly
understood
and
that
his
real
meaning
was
true
and
innocent
but
at
length
a
decree
was
passed
that
all
wyclif
books
should
be
burnt
and
thereupon
a
grand
bonfire
was
made
in
the
courtyard
of
the
archbishop
palace
while
all
the
church
bells
of
the
city
were
tolled
as
at
a
funeral
but
as
some
copies
of
the
books
escaped
the
flames
it
was
easy
to
make
new
copies
from
these
huss
was
excommunicated
but
he
still
went
on
teaching
in
pope
john
xxiii
proclaimed
a
crusade
against
ladislaus
king
of
naples
with
whom
he
had
quarrelled
and
ordered
that
it
should
be
preached
and
that
money
should
be
collected
for
it
all
through
latin
christendom
huss
and
his
chief
friend
whose
name
was
jerome
set
themselves
against
this
with
all
their
might
they
declared
it
to
be
unchristian
that
a
crusade
should
be
proclaimed
against
a
christian
prince
and
that
the
favours
of
the
church
should
be
held
out
as
a
reward
for
paying
money
or
for
shedding
of
blood
one
day
as
a
preacher
was
inviting
people
to
buy
his
indulgences
as
they
were
called
for
the
forgiveness
of
sins
he
was
interrupted
by
three
young
men
who
told
him
that
what
he
said
was
untrue
and
that
master
huss
had
taught
them
better
the
three
were
seized
and
were
condemned
to
die
and
although
it
would
seem
that
a
promise
was
afterwards
given
that
their
lives
should
be
spared
the
sentence
of
death
was
carried
into
effect
the
people
were
greatly
provoked
by
this
and
when
the
executioner
after
having
cut
off
the
heads
of
the
three
proclaimed
as
was
usual
whosoever
shall
do
the
like
let
him
look
for
the
like
a
cry
burst
forth
from
the
multitude
around
we
are
ready
to
do
and
to
suffer
the
like
women
dipped
their
handkerchiefs
in
the
blood
of
the
victims
and
treasured
it
up
as
a
precious
relic
some
of
the
crowd
even
licked
the
blood
the
bodies
were
carried
off
by
the
people
and
were
buried
in
bethlehem
chapel
and
huss
and
others
spoke
of
the
three
as
martyrs
by
this
affair
his
enemies
were
greatly
provoked
fresh
orders
were
sent
from
rome
for
the
destruction
of
wyclif
books
and
for
uttering
all
the
heaviest
sentences
of
the
church
against
huss
himself
he
therefore
left
prague
for
a
time
and
lived
chiefly
in
the
castles
of
bohemian
noblemen
who
were
friendly
to
him
writing
busily
as
well
as
preaching
against
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
errors
of
the
roman
church
we
shall
hear
more
of
huss
chapter
xxiv
the
council
of
constance
part
i
the
division
of
the
church
between
three
popes
cried
aloud
for
settlement
in
some
way
and
besides
this
there
were
general
complaints
as
to
the
need
of
reform
in
the
church
the
emperor
sigismund
urged
pope
john
to
call
a
general
council
for
the
consideration
of
these
subjects
and
although
john
hated
the
notion
of
such
a
meeting
he
could
not
help
consenting
he
wished
that
the
council
should
be
held
in
italy
as
he
might
hope
to
manage
it
more
easily
there
than
in
any
country
north
of
the
alps
and
he
was
very
angry
when
constance
a
town
on
a
large
lake
in
switzerland
was
chosen
as
the
place
it
seemed
like
a
token
of
bad
luck
when
as
he
was
passing
over
a
mountain
on
his
way
to
the
council
his
carriage
was
upset
and
he
lay
for
a
while
in
the
snow
using
bad
words
as
to
his
folly
in
undertaking
the
journey
and
when
he
came
in
sight
of
constance
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
said
that
it
looked
like
a
trap
for
foxes
in
that
trap
pope
john
was
caught
the
other
popes
gregory
xii
and
benedict
did
not
attend
although
both
had
been
invited
but
some
time
after
the
opening
of
the
council
which
was
on
the
of
november
the
emperor
sigismund
arrived
he
reached
constance
in
a
boat
which
had
brought
him
across
the
lake
very
early
on
christmas
morning
and
at
the
first
service
of
the
festival
which
was
held
before
daybreak
he
read
the
gospel
which
tells
of
the
decree
of
cæsar
augustus
that
all
the
world
should
be
taxed
for
it
was
considered
that
the
emperor
was
entitled
to
take
this
part
in
the
christmas
service
of
the
church
it
was
proposed
that
all
the
three
popes
should
resign
and
that
a
new
pope
should
be
chosen
in
answer
to
this
john
said
that
he
was
ready
to
resign
if
the
others
would
do
the
same
but
it
soon
became
clear
that
he
did
not
mean
to
keep
his
promise
honestly
he
tried
by
all
manner
of
tricks
to
ward
off
the
dangers
which
surrounded
him
and
after
he
had
more
than
once
tried
in
vain
to
get
away
from
constance
he
was
able
to
escape
one
day
when
the
members
of
the
council
were
amusing
themselves
at
a
tournament
given
by
a
prince
whom
john
had
persuaded
to
take
off
their
attention
in
this
way
the
council
however
in
his
absence
went
on
to
examine
the
charges
against
him
many
of
which
were
so
shocking
that
they
were
kept
secret
out
of
regard
for
his
office
john
by
letters
and
messengers
asked
for
delay
and
did
all
that
he
could
for
that
purpose
but
notwithstanding
all
his
arts
he
was
sentenced
to
be
deposed
from
the
papacy
for
simony
that
is
for
trafficking
in
holy
things
and
for
other
offences
on
being
informed
of
this
he
at
once
put
off
his
papal
robes
saying
that
since
he
had
put
them
on
he
had
never
enjoyed
a
quiet
day

part
ii
john
huss
the
bohemian
reformer
had
been
summoned
to
constance
that
he
might
give
an
account
of
himself
and
had
been
furnished
with
a
as
it
was
called
in
which
the
emperor
assured
him
of
protection
on
his
way
to
the
council
and
back
but
although
at
first
he
was
treated
as
if
he
were
free
it
was
pretended
soon
after
his
arrival
that
he
wished
to
run
away
and
under
this
pretence
he
was
shut
up
in
a
dark
and
filthy
prison
huss
had
no
friends
in
the
council
for
the
reforming
part
of
the
members
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
lest
it
should
be
thought
that
they
agreed
with
him
in
all
his
notions
and
when
he
was
at
length
brought
out
from
prison
where
his
health
had
suffered
much
and
when
he
was
required
to
answer
for
himself
without
having
been
allowed
the
use
of
books
to
prepare
himself
all
the
parties
in
the
council
turned
on
him
at
once
his
trial
lasted
three
days
the
charges
against
him
were
mostly
about
wyclif
doctrines
which
had
been
often
condemned
by
councils
at
rome
and
elsewhere
but
which
huss
was
supposed
to
hold
and
when
he
tried
to
explain
that
in
some
things
he
did
not
agree
with
wyclif
nobody
would
believe
him
some
of
his
bitterest
persecutors
were
men
who
had
once
been
his
friends
and
had
gone
with
him
in
his
reforming
opinions
after
his
trial
huss
was
sent
back
to
prison
for
a
month
and
all
kinds
of
ways
were
tried
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
the
opinions
which
were
blamed
in
him
but
he
stood
firm
in
what
he
believed
to
be
the
truth
at
length
he
was
brought
out
to
hear
his
sentence
he
claimed
the
protection
of
the
emperor
whose
he
had
received
as
we
have
seen
but
sigismund
had
been
hard
pressed
by
huss
enemies
who
told
him
that
a
promise
made
to
one
who
is
wrong
in
the
faith
is
not
to
be
kept
and
the
emperor
had
weakly
and
treacherously
yielded
so
that
he
could
only
blush
for
shame
when
huss
reminded
him
of
the
huss
was
condemned
to
death
and
was
from
his
orders
as
the
custom
was
that
is
to
say
they
first
put
into
his
hands
the
vessels
used
at
the
consecration
of
the
lord
supper
which
were
the
signs
of
his
being
a
priest
and
by
taking
away
these
from
him
they
reduced
him
from
a
priest
to
a
deacon
then
they
took
away
the
tokens
of
his
being
a
deacon
and
so
they
stripped
him
of
his
other
orders
one
after
another
and
when
at
last
they
had
turned
him
back
into
a
layman
they
led
him
away
to
be
burnt
it
is
said
that
as
he
saw
an
old
woman
carrying
a
faggot
to
the
pile
which
was
to
burn
him
he
smiled
and
said
o
holy
simplicity
meaning
that
her
intention
was
good
although
the
poor
old
creature
was
ignorant
and
misled
he
bore
his
death
with
great
patience
and
courage
and
then
his
ashes
and
such
scorched
bits
of
his
dress
as
remained
were
thrown
into
the
rhine
lest
his
followers
should
treasure
them
up
as
relics
july
about
ten
months
after
the
death
of
huss
his
old
friend
and
companion
jerome
of
prague
was
condemned
by
the
council
to
be
burnt
and
suffered
with
a
firmness
which
even
those
who
were
most
strongly
against
him
could
not
but
admire
may
part
iii
when
pope
john
had
been
got
rid
of
gregory
the
most
respectable
of
the
three
rival
popes
agreed
to
resign
his
claims
but
the
third
pope
benedict
would
hear
of
no
proposals
for
his
resignation
and
shut
himself
up
in
a
castle
on
the
coast
of
spain
where
he
not
only
continued
to
call
himself
pope
but
after
his
death
two
popes
of
his
line
were
set
up
in
succession
the
council
of
constance
however
finding
benedict
obstinate
did
not
trouble
itself
further
about
him
and
went
on
to
treat
the
papacy
as
vacant
there
was
a
great
dispute
whether
the
reform
of
the
church
which
people
had
long
asked
for
or
the
choice
of
a
new
pope
should
be
first
taken
in
hand
and
at
length
it
was
resolved
to
elect
a
pope
without
further
delay
the
choice
was
to
be
made
by
the
cardinals
and
some
others
who
were
joined
with
them
and
these
electors
were
all
shut
up
in
the
exchange
of
constance
a
building
which
is
still
to
be
seen
there
while
the
election
was
going
on
multitudes
of
all
ranks
and
even
the
emperor
himself
among
them
went
from
time
to
time
in
slow
procession
round
the
exchange
chanting
in
a
low
tone
litanies
in
which
they
prayed
that
the
choice
of
the
electors
might
be
guided
for
the
good
of
the
church
and
when
at
last
an
opening
was
made
in
the
wall
from
within
and
through
it
a
voice
proclaimed
we
have
a
pope
lord
otho
of
colonna
the
news
spread
at
once
through
all
constance
the
people
seemed
to
be
wild
with
joy
that
the
division
of
the
church
which
had
lasted
so
long
was
now
healed
all
the
bells
of
the
town
pealed
forth
joyfully
and
it
is
said
that
a
crowd
of
not
less
than
people
hurried
at
once
to
the
exchange
the
emperor
in
his
delight
threw
himself
at
the
new
feet
and
for
hours
together
vast
numbers
thronged
the
cathedral
where
the
pope
was
placed
on
the
high
altar
and
gave
them
his
blessing
it
was
on
martin
day
the
of
november
that
this
election
took
place
and
from
this
the
pope
styled
himself
martin
but
the
joy
which
had
been
shown
at
his
election
was
more
than
the
effect
warranted
the
council
had
chosen
a
pope
before
taking
up
the
reform
of
the
church
and
the
new
pope
was
no
friend
to
reform
during
the
rest
of
the
time
that
the
council
was
assembled
he
did
all
that
he
could
to
thwart
attempts
at
reform
and
when
at
the
end
of
it
he
rode
away
from
constance
with
the
emperor
holding
his
bridle
on
one
side
and
one
of
the
chief
german
princes
on
the
other
while
a
crowd
of
princes
nobles
clergy
and
others
as
many
as
accompanied
him
it
seemed
as
if
the
pope
had
got
above
all
the
sovereigns
of
the
world
the
great
thing
done
by
the
council
of
constance
was
that
it
declared
a
general
council
to
be
above
the
pope
and
entitled
to
depose
popes
if
the
good
of
the
church
should
require
it
chapter
xxv
the
hussites
the
news
of
huss
death
naturally
raised
a
general
feeling
of
anger
in
bohemia
where
his
followers
treated
his
memory
as
that
of
a
saint
and
kept
a
festival
in
his
honour
and
when
the
emperor
sigismund
in
succeeded
his
brother
wenceslaus
in
the
kingdom
of
bohemia
he
found
that
he
was
hated
by
his
new
subjects
on
account
of
his
share
in
the
death
of
huss
but
although
most
of
the
bohemians
might
now
be
called
hussites
there
were
great
divisions
among
the
hussites
themselves
some
had
lately
begun
to
insist
that
in
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
both
the
bread
and
the
wine
should
be
given
to
all
the
people
according
to
our
lord
own
example
instead
of
allowing
no
one
but
the
priest
to
receive
the
wine
according
to
the
roman
practice
these
people
who
insisted
on
the
sacramental
cup
were
called
from
the
latin
which
means
a
or
but
among
those
who
agreed
in
this
opinion
there
were
serious
differences
as
to
some
other
points
in
the
summer
of
the
first
public
communion
was
celebrated
at
a
place
where
the
town
of
tabor
was
afterwards
built
it
was
a
very
different
kind
of
ceremony
from
what
had
been
usual
there
were
three
hundred
altars
but
they
were
without
any
covering
the
chalices
were
of
wood
the
clergy
wore
only
their
dress
and
a
followed
at
which
the
rich
shared
with
their
poorer
brethren
the
wilder
party
among
the
hussites
were
called
from
tabor
which
became
the
chief
abode
of
this
party
they
now
took
to
putting
their
opinions
into
practice
they
declared
churches
and
their
ornaments
pictures
images
organs
and
the
like
to
be
abominable
and
they
went
about
in
bands
destroying
everything
that
they
thought
superstitious
and
thus
bohemia
which
had
been
famous
for
the
size
and
beauty
of
its
churches
was
so
desolated
that
hardly
a
church
was
left
in
it
and
those
which
are
now
standing
have
almost
all
been
built
since
the
time
when
the
hussites
destroyed
the
older
churches
the
chief
leader
of
the
taborites
was
john
ziska
whose
name
is
said
by
some
to
mean
and
at
least
he
had
lost
an
eye
in
early
life
ziska
had
such
a
talent
for
war
that
although
his
men
were
only
rough
peasants
armed
with
nothing
better
than
clubs
flails
and
such
like
tools
which
they
had
been
accustomed
to
use
in
husbandry
he
trained
them
to
encounter
regular
armies
and
always
came
off
with
victory
he
taught
his
soldiers
to
make
their
flails
very
dangerous
weapons
by
tipping
them
with
iron
and
to
place
their
waggons
together
in
such
a
way
that
each
block
of
waggons
made
a
sort
of
little
fortress
against
which
the
force
of
the
enemy
dashed
in
vain
but
ziska
bravery
and
skill
were
disgraced
by
his
savage
fierceness
he
never
spared
an
enemy
he
took
delight
in
putting
clergy
and
monks
to
the
sword
or
in
burning
them
in
pitch
and
in
burning
and
pulling
down
churches
and
monasteries
in
the
course
of
the
war
he
lost
his
remaining
eye
but
he
still
continued
to
act
as
general
with
the
same
skill
and
success
as
before
his
cruelty
became
greater
continually
and
the
last
year
of
his
life
was
the
bloodiest
ziska
died
in
october
it
is
said
that
he
directed
that
his
skin
should
be
taken
off
his
body
and
made
into
the
covering
of
a
drum
at
the
sound
of
which
he
expected
all
enemies
to
flee
in
terror
but
the
story
is
probably
not
true
at
his
death
a
part
of
his
old
companions
called
themselves
as
if
they
had
lost
their
father
and
could
never
find
another
but
other
generals
arose
to
carry
on
the
same
kind
of
war
while
their
wild
followers
were
wrought
up
to
a
sort
of
fury
which
nothing
could
withstand
on
the
side
of
the
church
a
holy
war
was
proclaimed
and
vast
armies
made
up
from
all
nations
of
europe
were
gathered
for
the
invasion
of

one
of
these
crusades
was
led
by

beaufort
bishop
of
winchester
and
of
king
henry
vi
of

another
by
a
famous
italian
cardinal
julian
cesarini
but
the
courage
and
fury
of
the
bohemians
with
their
savage
appearance
and
their
strange
manner
of
fighting
drove
back
all
assaults
with
immense
loss
in
one
campaign
after
another
until
cesarini
the
leader
in
the
last
crusade
was
convinced
that
there
was
no
hope
of
putting
the
bohemians
down
by
force
and
that
some
other
means
must
be
tried
chapter
xxvi
councils
of
basel
and
florence
it
had
been
settled
at
the
council
of
constance
that
regularly
from
time
to
time
there
should
be
held
a
general
council
by
which
name
was
then
meant
a
council
gathered
from
the
whole
of
the
western
church
but
without
any
representatives
of
the
eastern
churches
and
according
to
this
decree
a
council
was
to
meet
at
basel
on
the
rhine
in
the
year
it
was
just
before
the
time
of
its
opening
that
cardinal
cesarini
was
defeated
by
the
hussites
of
bohemia
as
we
have
seen
being
convinced
that
some
gentler
means
ought
to
be
tried
with
them
he
begged
the
pope
to
allow
them
a
hearing
and
he
invited
them
to
send
deputies
to
the
council
of
basel
of
which
he
was
president
the
bohemians
did
as
they
were
asked
to
do
and
thirty
of
them
appeared
before
the
council
rough
men
for
the
most
part
headed
by
procopius
who
was
at
once
a
priest
and
a
warrior
and
was
called
the
great
in
order
to
distinguish
him
from
another
of
the
same
name
a
dispute
which
lasted
many
weeks
was
carried
on
between
the
leaders
of
these
bohemians
and
some
members
of
the
council
and
at
length
four
points
were
agreed
on
the
chief
of
these
was
that
the
chalice
at
the
holy
communion
should
not
be
confined
to
the
priest
alone
but
might
be
given
to
such
persons
as
should
desire
it
this
was
one
of
the
things
which
had
been
most
desired
by
the
bohemian
reformers
we
need
not
go
further
into
the
history
of
the
hussites
and
of
the
parties
into
which
they
were
divided
but
it
is
worth
while
to
remember
that
the
use
of
the
sacramental
cup
was
allowed
in
bohemia
for
two
hundred
years
while
in
all
other
churches
under
the
roman
authority
it
was
forbidden
soon
after
the
meeting
of
the
council
of
basel
the
pope
whose
name
was
eugenius
grew
jealous
lest
it
should
get
too
much
power
and
sent
orders
that
it
should
break
up
but
the
members
were
not
disposed
to
bear
this
they
declared
that
the
council
was
the
highest
authority
in
the
church
and
superior
to
the
pope
and
they
asked
eugenius
to
join
them
at
basel
and
threatened
him
in
case
of
his
refusal
just
at
that
time
eugenius
was
driven
from
rome
by
his
people
and
therefore
he
found
it
convenient
to
try
to
smooth
over
differences
and
to
keep
good
terms
with
the
council
but
after
a
while
the
disagreement
broke
out
again
the
pope
had
called
a
council
to
meet
at
ferrara
in
italy
in
order
to
consult
with
some
greeks
at
the
head
of
whom
were
the
emperor
and
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
as
to
the
union
of
the
greek
and
latin
churches
and
he
desired
the
members
of
the
basel
council
to
remove
to
ferrara
that
they
might
take
part
in
the
new
assembly
but
only
a
few
obeyed
and
those
who
remained
at
basel
were
resolved
to
carry
on
their
quarrel
to
the
uttermost
first
they
allowed
eugenius
a
certain
time
within
which
they
required
him
either
to
appear
at
basel
or
to
send
some
one
in
his
stead
then
they
lengthened
out
this
time
somewhat
and
as
he
still
did
not
appear
they
first
suspended
him
from
his
office
then
declared
him
to
be
deposed
and
at
length
went
on
to
choose
another
pope
in
his
stead
the
person
thus
chosen
was
amadeus
who
for
nearly
thirty
years
had
been
duke
of
savoy
but
had
lately
given
over
his
dukedom
to
his
son
and
had
put
himself
at
the
head
of
twelve
old
knights
who
had
formed
themselves
into
an
order
of
hermits
at
ripaille
near
the
lake
of
geneva
the
new
pope
bargained
that
he
should
not
be
required
to
part
with
the
long
white
beard
which
he
had
worn
as
a
hermit
but
after
a
while
finding
that
it
looked
strange
among
the
smooth
chins
of
those
around
him
he
of
his
own
accord
allowed
it
to
be
shaved
off
but
this
attempt
to
set
up
an
antipope
came
to
very
little
felix
as
the
old
duke
called
himself
on
being
elected
was
obliged
to
submit
to
eugenius
and
the
council
of
basel
after
dwindling
away
by
degrees
and
being
removed
from
one
place
to
another
died
out
so
obscurely
that
its
end
was
unnoticed
by
any
one
eugenius
held
his
council
at
ferrara
and
afterwards
removed
it
to
florence
and
it
seemed
as
if
by
his
management
the
greeks
who
were
very
poor
and
were
greatly
in
need
of
help
against
the
turks
were
brought
to
an
agreement
with
the
latins
as
to
the
questions
which
had
been
so
long
disputed
between
the
churches
the
union
of
the
churches
was
celebrated
by
a
grand
service
in
the
cathedral
of
florence
but
as
in
former
times
the
greeks
found
on
their
return
home
that
their
countrymen
would
not
agree
to
what
had
been
done
and
thus
the
breach
between
the
two
churches
continued
until
a
few
years
later
constantinople
was
taken
by
the
turks
and
so
the
greek
empire
came
to
an
end

chapter
xxvii
nicolas
and
pius
ii
the
next
pope
nicolas
was
a
man
who
had
raised
himself
from
a
humble
station
by
his
learning
ability
and
good
character
he
was
chiefly
remarkable
for
his
love
of
learning
and
for
the
bounty
which
he
spent
on
learned
men
for
learning
had
come
to
be
regarded
with
very
high
honour
and
those
who
were
famous
for
it
found
themselves
persons
of
great
importance
who
were
welcome
at
the
courts
of
princes
from
the
emperor
of
the
west
down
to
the
little
dukes
and
lords
of
italy
but
we
must
not
fancy
that
these
learned
men
were
all
that
they
ought
to
have
been
they
were
too
commonly
selfish
and
jealous
vain
greedy
quarrelsome
unthrifty
they
flattered
the
great
however
unworthy
these
might
be
and
in
religion
many
of
them
were
more
like
the
old
heathen
greeks
than
christians
in
the
time
of
nicolas
a
terrible
calamity
fell
on
christendom
by
the
loss
of
constantinople
the
turks
a
barbarous
and
mahometan
people
had
long
been
pressing
on
the
eastern
empire
and
swallowing
up
more
and
more
of
it
it
was
the
fear
of
these
advancing
enemies
that
led
the
greeks
repeatedly
to
seek
for
union
with
the
latin
church
in
the
hope
that
they
might
thus
get
help
from
the
west
for
the
defence
of
what
remained
of
their
empire
but
these
reconciliations
never
lasted
long
more
especially
as
the
greeks
did
not
gain
that
aid
from
their
western
brethren
for
the
sake
of
which
they
had
yielded
in
matters
of
religion
one
more
attempt
of
this
kind
was
made
after
the
council
of
florence
but
it
was
vain
and
in
the
turks
under
sultan
mahomet
became
masters
of
constantinople
a
great
number
of
learned
greeks
who
were
scattered
by
this
conquest
found
their
way
into
the
west
bringing
with
them
their
knowledge
and
many
greek
manuscripts
and
such
scholars
were
gladly
welcomed
by
pope
nicolas
and
others
not
only
were
their
books
bought
up
but
the
pope
sent
persons
to
search
for
manuscripts
all
over
greece
in
order
to
rescue
as
much
as
possible
from
destruction
by
the
barbarians
nicolas
founded
the
famous
vatican
library
in
the
papal
palace
at
rome
and
presented
a
vast
number
of
manuscripts
to
it
for
it
was
not
until
this
very
time
that
printing
was
invented
and
formerly
all
books
were
written
by
hand
which
is
a
slow
and
costly
kind
of
work
as
compared
with
printing
for
in
writing
out
books
the
whole
labour
has
to
be
done
for
every
single
copy
but
when
a
printer
has
once
set
up
his
types
he
can
print
any
number
of
copies
without
any
other
trouble
than
that
of
inking
the
types
and
pressing
them
on
the
paper
by
means
of
a
machine
for
each
copy
that
is
wanted
the
art
of
printing
was
brought
from
germany
to
rome
under
nicolas
and
he
encouraged
it
like
everything
else
which
was
connected
with
learning
nicolas
also
had
a
plan
for
rebuilding
rome
in
a
very
grand
style
and
began
with
the
church
of
peter
which
he
intended
to
surround
with
palaces
gardens
terraces
libraries
and
smaller
churches
but
he
did
not
live
to
carry
this
work
far
one
effect
of
the
new
encouragement
of
learning
was
that
scholars
began
to
inquire
into
the
truth
of
some
things
which
had
long
been
allowed
to
pass
without
question
and
thus
in
no
long
time
the
story
of
constantine
donation
and
the
false
decretals
were
shown
to
be
forged
and
worthless
see
page
the
shock
of
the
loss
of
constantinople
was
felt
all
through
christendom
and
nicholas
attempted
to
get
up
a
crusade
but
died
before
much
came
of
it
when
however
the
turks
in
the
pride
of
victory
advanced
further
into
europe
and
laid
siege
to
belgrade
on
the
danube
they
were
driven
back
with
great
loss
by
the
skill
of
john
huniades
a
general
and
by
the
courage
which
john
of
capistrano
a
franciscan
friar
was
able
by
his
exhortations
and
his
prayers
to
rouse
in
the
hearts
of
the
besieged
nicolas
died
in
and
his
successor
calixtus
in
the
next
pope
æneas
sylvius
piccolomini
who
took
the
name
of
pius
was
a
very
remarkable
man
he
had
taken
a
strong
part
against
pope
eugenius
at
basel
and
had
even
been
secretary
to
the
old
felix
but
he
afterwards
made
his
peace
by
doing
great
services
to
eugenius
and
then
he
rose
step
by
step
until
at
the
death
of
calixtus
he
was
elected
pope
pius
was
a
man
of
very
great
ability
in
many
ways
but
his
health
was
so
much
shaken
before
he
became
pope
that
he
was
not
able
to
do
all
that
he
might
have
done
if
he
had
been
in
the
fulness
of
his
strength
he
took
up
the
crusade
with
great
zeal
but
found
no
hearty
support
from
others
a
meeting
which
he
held
at
mantua
for
the
purpose
had
little
effect
at
last
although
suffering
from
gout
and
fever
the
pope
made
his
way
from
rome
to
ancona
on
the
adriatic
where
he
expected
to
find
both
land
and
sea
forces
ready
for
the
crusade
but
on
the
way
he
fell
in
with
some
of
the
troops
which
had
been
collected
for
the
purpose
and
they
turned
out
to
be
such
wretched
creatures
and
so
utterly
unfit
for
the
hardships
of
war
that
he
could
only
give
them
his
blessing
and
tell
them
to
go
back
to
their
homes
and
although
after
reaching
ancona
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
venetian
ships
enter
the
harbour
for
his
service
he
was
so
worn
out
by
sickness
that
he
died
on
the
next
day
but
one
and
after
his
death
the
crusade
on
which
he
had
so
much
set
his
heart
came
to
nothing

jerome
savonarola
part
i
there
is
not
much
to
tell
about
the
popes
after
pius
ii
until
we
come
to
alexander
who
was
a
spaniard
named
roderick
borgia
and
was
pope
from
to
and
the
story
of
alexander
is
too
shocking
to
be
told
here
for
there
is
hardly
anything
in
all
history
so
bad
as
the
accounts
which
we
have
of
him
and
of
his
family
he
is
supposed
to
have
died
of
drinking
by
mistake
some
poison
which
he
had
prepared
for
a
rich
cardinal
whose
wealth
he
wished
to
get
into
his
hands
instead
therefore
of
telling
you
about
the
popes
of
this
time
i
shall
give
some
account
of
a
man
who
became
very
famous
as
a
preacher
jerome
savonarola
savonarola
was
born
in
at
ferrara
where
his
grandfather
had
been
physician
to
the
duke
and
his
family
wished
him
to
follow
the
same
profession
but
jerome
was
set
on
becoming
a
monk
and
from
this
nothing
could
move
him
he
therefore
joined
the
dominican
friars
and
after
a
while
he
was
removed
to
mark
at
florence
a
famous
convent
of
his
order
he
found
things
in
a
bad
state
there
but
he
was
chosen
prior
or
head
of
the
convent
and
reformed
it
so
that
it
rose
in
character
and
the
number
of
the
monks
was
much
increased
he
also
became
a
great
preacher
so
that
even
the
vast
cathedral
of
florence
could
not
hold
the
crowds
which
flocked
to
hear
him
he
was
especially
fond
of
preaching
on
the
dark
prophecies
of
the
revelation
and
of
declaring
that
the
judgments
of
god
were
about
to
come
on
florence
and
on
all
italy
because
of
sin
and
he
sometimes
fancied
that
he
not
only
gathered
such
things
from
scripture
but
that
they
were
revealed
to
him
by
visions
from
heaven
at
this
time
a
family
named
medici
had
got
the
chief
power
in
florence
into
their
hands
and
savonarola
always
opposed
them
because
he
thought
that
they
had
no
right
to
such
power
in
a
city
which
ought
to
be
free
but
when
lorenzo
the
head
of
the
family
was
dying
he
sent
for
savonarola
because
he
thought
him
the
only
one
of
the
clergy
who
would
be
likely
to
speak
honestly
to
him
of
his
sins
and
to
show
him
the
way
of
seeking
forgiveness
savonarola
did
his
part
firmly
and
pointed
out
some
of
lorenzo
acts
as
being
those
of
which
he
was
especially
bound
to
repent
but
when
he
desired
him
to
restore
the
liberties
of
florence
it
was
more
than
the
dying
man
could
make
up
his
mind
to
and
savonarola
thinking
that
his
repentance
could
not
be
sincere
if
he
refused
this
left
him
without
giving
him
the
absolution
but
although
savonarola
was
a
very
sincere
and
pious
man
he
did
not
always
show
good
judgment
for
instance
when
he
wished
to
get
rid
of
the
disorderly
way
in
which
the
young
people
of
florence
used
to
behave
at
the
beginning
of
lent
he
sent
a
number
of
boys
about
the
city
where
they
entered
into
houses
and
asked
the
inhabitants
to
give
up
to
them
any
which
they
might
have
then
these
vanities
as
they
were
called
were
all
gathered
together
and
were
built
up
into
a
pile
fifteen
stories
high
there
were
among
them
cards
and
dice
fineries
of
women
dress
bad
books
musical
instruments
pictures
and
statues
the
whole
heap
was
of
great
value
and
a
merchant
from
venice
offered
a
large
sum
for
it
but
the
money
was
refused
and
he
was
forced
to
throw
in
his
own
picture
as
an
addition
to
the
other
vanities
when
night
came
a
long
procession
under
savonarola
orders
passed
through
the
streets
and
then
the
pile
was
set
on
fire
amidst
the
sound
of
bells
drums
and
trumpets
and
the
shouts
of
the
multitude
who
had
been
worked
up
to
a
share
of
savonarola
zeal
but
the
wiser
people
were
distressed
by
the
mistakes
of
judgment
which
he
had
shown
in
setting
children
to
search
out
the
faults
of
their
elders
and
in
mixing
up
harmless
things
in
the
same
destruction
with
those
which
were
connected
with
deep
sinfulness
and
vice
and
this
want
of
judgment
was
still
more
shown
a
year
later
when
after
having
repeated
the
bonfire
of
vanities
savonarola
followers
danced
wildly
in
three
circles
around
a
cross
set
up
in
front
of
mark
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
crazy
dervishes
of
the
east
part
ii
savonarola
had
raised
up
a
host
of
enemies
and
some
of
them
were
eagerly
looking
for
an
opportunity
of
doing
him
some
mischief
at
length
one
francis
of
apulia
a
franciscan
friar
challenged
him
to
what
was
called
the
or
judgment
of
fire
as
a
trial
of
the
truth
of
his
doctrine
and
after
much
trouble
it
was
settled
that
a
friend
of
each
should
pass
through
this
trial
which
was
supposed
to
be
a
way
of
finding
out
god
judgment
as
to
the
truth
of
the
matter
in
dispute
two
great
heaps
of
fuel
were
piled
up
in
a
public
place
at
florence
they
were
each
forty
yards
long
and
two
yards
and
a
half
high
with
an
opening
of
a
yard
width
between
them
and
it
was
intended
that
these
heaps
should
be
set
on
fire
and
that
the
champions
should
try
to
pass
between
the
two
as
a
famous
monk
had
done
at
florence
in
time
hundreds
of
years
before
but
when
a
vast
crowd
had
been
brought
to
see
the
ordeal
they
were
much
disappointed
at
finding
that
it
was
delayed
because
savonarola
enemies
fancied
that
he
might
perhaps
make
use
of
some
magical
charms
against
the
flames
there
was
a
long
dispute
about
this
and
while
the
parties
were
still
wrangling
a
heavy
shower
came
down
on
the
crowd
the
magistrates
then
forbade
the
trial
the
people
tired
and
hungry
from
waiting
drenched
by
the
rain
provoked
by
the
wearisome
squabble
which
had
caused
the
delay
and
after
all
balked
of
the
expected
sight
broke
out
against
savonarola
and
he
had
great
difficulty
in
reaching
mark
under
the
protection
of
some
friends
who
closed
around
him
and
kept
off
the
angry
multitude
two
days
later
the
convent
was
besieged
and
when
the
defenders
were
obliged
to
surrender
it
savonarola
and
the
friar
who
was
to
have
undergone
the
ordeal
on
his
side
were
sent
to
prison
savonarola
had
a
long
trial
during
which
he
was
often
tortured
but
whatever
might
be
wrung
from
him
in
this
way
he
afterwards
declared
that
it
was
not
to
be
believed
because
the
weakness
of
his
body
could
not
bear
the
pain
of
torture
and
he
confessed
whatever
might
be
asked
of
him
this
trial
was
carried
on
under
the
authority
of
the
wicked
pope
alexander
vi
although
no
charge
of
error
as
to
the
faith
could
be
made
out
against
savonarola
his
enemies
were
bent
on
his
death
and
he
and
two
of
his
companions
were
sentenced
to
be
hanged
and
burnt
like
huss
they
had
to
go
through
the
form
of
being
degraded
from
their
orders
and
at
the
end
of
this
it
was
a
bishop
part
to
say
to
each
i
separate
thee
from
the
church
militant
that
is
from
the
church
which
is
carrying
on
its
warfare
here
on
earth
but
the
bishop
who
had
once
been
one
of
savonarola
friars
at
mark
was
very
uneasy
and
said
in
his
confusion
i
separate
thee
from
the
church
triumphant
that
is
from
the
church
when
its
warfare
has
ended
in
victory
and
triumph
savonarola
saw
the
mistake
and
corrected
it
by
saying
from
the
militant
not
from
the
triumphant
for
is
not
thine
to
do
savonarola
party
did
not
die
out
with
him
but
long
continued
to
cherish
his
memory
among
those
who
were
most
earnest
in
this
was
the
great
artist
michael
angelo
buonarotti
who
had
been
one
of
his
hearers
in
youth
and
even
to
his
latest
days
used
to
read
his
works
with
interest
and
to
speak
of
him
with
reverence

one
of
the
popes
who
had
come
between
pius
ii
and
alexander
vi
was
desirous
to
gain
for
the
roman
see
all
that
it
had
lost
or
had
ever
claimed
he
was
not
a
man
of
religious
character
but
plunged
deeply
into
politics
and
even
acted
as
a
soldier
in
war
thus
at
the
siege
of
mirandola
in
the
winter
of
he
lived
for
weeks
in
a
little
hut
regardless
of
the
frost
and
snow
of
the
roughness
and
scantiness
of
his
food
and
when
most
of
those
around
him
were
frightened
away
by
the
which
came
from
the
walls
of
the
fortress
the
stout
old
pope
kept
his
place
and
directed
the
pointing
of
his
own
cannon
against
the
town
his
successor
leo
who
was
of
the
florentine
family
of
medici
was
fond
of
elegant
pleasures
and
of
hunting
his
tastes
were
costly
and
continually
brought
him
into
difficulties
as
to
money
the
manner
of
life
in
leo
court
was
gay
luxurious
and
far
from
strict
he
had
comedies
acted
before
him
which
were
hardly
fit
for
the
amusement
of
the
chief
bishop
of
christendom
he
is
famous
for
his
encouragement
of
the
arts
and
it
was
in
his
time
that
the
art
of
painting
reached
its
highest
perfection
through
the
genius
of
michael
angelo
buonarotti
who
has
been
already
mentioned
as
a
disciple
of
savonarola
and
of
raphael
sanzio
in
the
art
of
architecture
a
great
change
took
place
about
this
time
for
some
hundreds
of
years
it
had
been
usual
to
build
in
what
is
called
the
style
of
which
the
chief
mark
is
the
use
of
pointed
arches
not
that
there
was
no
change
during
all
that
time
for
there
are
great
differences
between
the
earlier
and
the
later
kinds
of
gothic
and
these
have
since
been
so
carefully
studied
that
skilful
people
can
tell
from
the
look
of
a
building
the
time
at
which
every
part
of
it
was
erected
but
a
little
before
the
year
the
gothic
gave
way
to
another
style
and
one
of
the
greatest
works
ever
done
in
this
new
style
was
the
vast
church
of
peter
at
rome
i
have
mentioned
that
nicolas
thought
of
rebuilding
the
ancient
church
which
had
stood
since
the
time
of
constantine
the
great
and
that
he
had
even
begun
the
work
but
now
both
the
old
basilica
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
church
which
nicolas
had
made
were
swept
away
and
something
far
grander
was
designed
there
were
several
architects
who
carried
on
the
building
of
this
great
church
one
after
another
but
the
grand
dome
of
peter
which
rises
into
the
air
over
the
whole
city
was
the
work
of
michael
angelo
who
was
not
only
a
painter
but
an
architect
and
a
sculptor
it
was
by
offering
indulgences
or
spiritual
favours
forgiveness
of
sins
and
the
like
as
a
reward
for
gifts
towards
the
new
peter
that
julius
raised
the
anger
and
disgust
of
the
german
reformer
martin
luther
and
thus
it
was
the
building
of
the
most
magnificent
of
roman
churches
that
led
to
the
revolt
which
took
away
from
the
popes
a
great
part
of
their
spiritual
dominion

the
inquisition
all
through
the
times
of
which
i
had
been
speaking
missions
to
the
heathen
were
actively
carried
on
much
of
this
kind
was
done
in
asia
and
indeed
the
heart
of
asia
seems
to
have
been
more
open
and
better
known
to
europeans
during
some
part
of
the
middle
ages
than
it
has
ever
been
since
but
as
those
parts
were
so
far
off
and
so
hard
to
get
at
it
often
happened
that
dishonest
people
for
their
own
purposes
brought
to
europe
wonderful
tales
of
the
conversion
of
eastern
nations
or
of
their
readiness
to
be
converted
which
had
no
real
ground
and
sometimes
the
crafty
asiatic
princes
themselves
made
a
pretence
of
willingness
to
receive
the
gospel
when
all
that
they
really
wanted
was
to
get
some
advantages
of
other
kinds
from
the
pope
and
the
christians
of
the
west
a
great
deal
was
heard
in
europe
of
a
person
who
was
called
prester
that
is
to
say
or
john
he
was
believed
to
live
in
the
far
east
and
to
be
both
a
king
and
a
christian
priest
and
there
really
was
at
one
time
a
line
of
christian
princes
in
asia
between
lake
baikal
and
the
northern
border
of
china
whose
capital
was
karakorum
but
in
their
kingdom
was
overthrown
by
the
tartar
conqueror
although
the
belief
in
prester
john
which
had
always
been
mixed
with
a
good
deal
of
fable
continued
long
after
to
float
in
the
minds
of
the
western
christians
the
mendicant
orders
which
as
we
have
seen
were
founded
in
the
time
of
innocent
took
up
the
work
of
missions
with
great
zeal
and
some
of
the
franciscan
missionaries
especially
by
undergoing
martyrdom
gained
great
credit
for
their
order
in
its
early
days
there
were
also
travellers
who
made
their
way
into
the
east
from
curiosity
or
some
other
such
reason
and
brought
home
accounts
of
what
they
had
seen
the
most
famous
of
these
travellers
was
marco
polo
a
venetian
of
a
trading
family
who
lived
many
years
in
china
and
found
his
way
back
to
europe
by
india
and
ceylon
some
of
these
travellers
report
that
they
found
the
nestorian
clergy
enjoying
great
influence
at
the
courts
of
asiatic
sovereigns
for
the
nestorians
had
been
very
active
in
missions
at
an
earlier
time
and
had
made
many
converts
in
asia
but
the
travellers
who
saw
them
only
after
they
had
been
long
settled
there
describe
them
very
unfavourably
in
all
ways
john
of
monte
corvino
an
italian
was
established
by
pope
clement
as
archbishop
of
cambalu
or
pekin
with
seven
bishops
under
him
and
christianity
seemed
thus
far
to
be
flourishing
in
that
region
pages
part
i
in
the
meantime
the
people
of
countries
bordering
on
the
baltic
sea
were
converted
although
not
without
much
trouble
sometimes
they
would
profess
to
welcome
the
gospel
but
as
soon
as
the
preachers
had
left
them
they
disowned
it
and
washed
themselves
as
if
by
doing
so
they
might
get
rid
of
their
christian
baptism
and
the
missionaries
often
found
themselves
at
a
loss
how
to
deal
with
the
ignorant
superstition
of
these
people
thus
a
missionary
in
livonia
named
dietrich
was
threatened
with
death
because
an
eclipse
had
taken
place
during
his
visit
to
their
country
and
they
fancied
that
he
had
swallowed
the
sun
at
another
time
his
life
was
in
danger
because
the
natives
saw
that
his
fields
were
in
better
condition
than
theirs
and
instead
of
understanding
that
this
was
the
effect
of
his
greater
skill
and
care
they
charged
him
with
having
brought
it
about
by
magical
arts
they
therefore
resolved
to
settle
his
fate
by
bringing
forward
a
horse
who
was
regarded
as
sacred
to
their
gods
and
observing
how
the
beast
behaved
at
first
the
horse
put
forward
his
right
foot
which
would
have
saved
the
missionary
life
but
the
heathen
diviners
said
that
the
god
of
christians
was
sitting
on
the
horse
back
and
directing
him
and
they
insisted
that
the
back
should
be
rubbed
in
order
to
get
rid
of
such
influence
but
after
this
had
been
done
the
horse
again
put
forward
the
same
foot
and
much
against
the
will
of
the
livonians
dietrich
was
allowed
to
go
free
sometimes
the
missionaries
tried
other
things
to
help
the
effect
of
their
preaching
thus
a
later
missionary
in
livonia
albert
of
apeldern
in
order
to
give
the
people
some
knowledge
of
scripture
history
got
up
what
was
called
a
prophetical
play
in
which
gideon
david
and
herod
were
to
appear
but
when
gideon
and
his
men
began
to
fight
the
midianites
on
the
stage
the
heathens
took
alarm
lest
some
treacherous
trick
should
be
practised
on
them
and
they
all
ran
away
in
affright
albert
of
apeldern
founded
a
military
order
somewhat
on
the
plan
of
the
templars
for
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
on
the
baltic
and
it
was
afterwards
joined
with
another
order
the
teutonic
or
german
order
which
was
thus
formed
became
very
famous
by
subduing
the
nations
of
the
baltic
coasts
it
forced
them
to
receive
christianity
got
possession
of
their
lands
and
laid
the
foundation
of
a
power
which
has
grown
by
degrees
into
the
great
prussian
or
german
empire
the
work
of
missions
was
carried
on
also
in
russia
lithuania
and
other
northern
countries
so
that
by
the
time
which
we
have
now
reached
it
might
be
said
that
all
europe
was
in
some
way
or
other
converted
to
profess
the
gospel
about
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
discoveries
of
the
portuguese
in
africa
and
the
east
and
those
of
the
spaniards
in
the
great
western
continent
opened
new
fields
for
missionary
labour
but
of
this
we
need
not
now
speak
more
particularly
unhappily
the
church
was
not
content
with
trying
to
convince
people
of
the
truth
of
its
doctrine
by
gentle
means
but
disgraced
itself
by
persecution
we
have
already
noticed
the
horrible
wars
against
the
albigenses
in
the
south
of
france
and
cruel
persecutions
were
carried
on
in
spain
against
jews
mahometans
and
persons
suspected
of
heresy
or
such
like
offences
the
conduct
of
these
persecutions
was
in
the
hands
of
the
inquisition
which
did
its
work
without
any
regard
to
the
rules
of
justice
and
was
made
more
terrible
by
the
darkness
and
mystery
of
its
proceedings
it
kept
spies
to
pry
into
all
men
concerns
and
to
give
secret
information
against
them
even
the
nearest
relatives
were
not
safe
from
each
other
under
this
dreadful
system
multitudes
were
put
to
death
and
others
were
glad
to
escape
with
such
punishments
as
entire
loss
of
their
property
or
imprisonment
which
was
in
many
cases
for
life
see
in
the
course
of
all
these
hundreds
of
years
christian
religion
had
been
much
corrupted
from
its
first
purity
the
power
of
the
clergy
over
the
ignorant
people
had
become
far
greater
than
it
ought
to
have
been
and
too
commonly
it
was
kept
up
by
the
encouragement
of
superstitions
and
abuses
the
popes
claimed
supreme
power
on
earth
they
claimed
the
right
of
setting
up
and
plucking
down
emperors
and
kings
they
meddled
with
appointments
to
sees
parishes
and
all
manner
of
offices
in
the
church
throughout
all
western
europe
they
wished
to
make
it
appear
as
if
bishops
had
no
authority
except
what
they
held
through
the
grant
of
the
pope
there
were
general
complaints
against
the
faults
of
the
clergy
and
among
the
mass
of
men
religion
had
become
in
great
part
little
better
than
an
affair
of
forms
from
all
quarters
cries
for
reform
were
raised
and
a
reform
was
speedily
to
come
by
which
among
other
things
our
own
country
was
set
free
from
the
power
of
the
popes
and
the
doctrine
of
our
church
