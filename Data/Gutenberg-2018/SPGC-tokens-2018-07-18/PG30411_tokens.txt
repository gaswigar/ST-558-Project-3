said

with
an
introduction
by
james
millington
new
york
appleton
bond
street
introduction
the
time
of
shakspere
downwards
wits
and
authors
innumerable
have
made
themselves
and
the
public
more
or
less
merry
at
the
expense
of
the
earlier
efforts
of
the
student
of
a
strange
tongue
but
it
has
been
reserved
to
our
own
time
for
a
instructor
to
perpetrate
at
his
own
expense
the
monstrous
joke
of
publishing
a
guide
to
conversation
in
a
language
of
which
it
is
only
too
evident
that
every
word
is
utterly
strange
to
him
the
teutonic
sage
who
evolved
the
ideal
portrait
of
an
elephant
from
his
inner
consciousness
was
a
commonplace
fact
person
compared
with
the
daring
visionary
who
conjures
up
a
complete
system
of
language
from
the
same
fertile
but
untrustworthy
source
the
piquancy
of
senhor
pedro
carolino
guide
of
the
conversation
in
portuguese
and
is
enhanced
by
the
evident
and
careful
compilation
of
the
little
book
or
as
pedro
himself
gravely
expresses
it
for
the
care
what
we
wrote
him
and
for
her
typographical
correction
in
short
the
guide
of
the
conversation
in
portuguese
and
was
written
with
serious
intent
and
for
the
purpose
of
initiating
portuguese
students
into
the
mysteries
of
the
english
language
the
earlier
portions
of
the
book
are
divided
into
three
columns
the
first
giving
the
portuguese
the
second
what
in
the
opinion
of
the
author
is
the
english
equivalent
and
the
third
the
english
equivalent
phonetically
spelt
so
that
the
tyro
may
at
the
same
time
master
our
barbarous
phraseology
and
the
pronunciation
thereof
in
the
second
part
of
the
work
the
learner
is
supposed
to
have
sufficiently
mastered
the
pronunciation
of
the
english
language
to
be
left
to
his
own
devices
a
little
consideration
of
the
shaping
of
our
author
english
phrases
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
materials
used
have
been
a
and
a
dictionary
with
these
slight
impedimenta
has
the
daring
lusitanian
ventured
upon
the
unknown
deep
of
a
strange
language
and
the
result
to
quote
again
from
the
preface
may
be
worth
the
acceptation
of
the
studious
persons
and
especially
of
the
youth
at
which
we
dedicate
him
particularly
but
will
at
all
events
contribute
not
a
little
to
the
youth
hilarity
to
begin
with
the
vocabulary
it
is
perhaps
hardly
fair
to
expect
a
professor
of
languages
to
trouble
himself
with
degrees
of
kindred
still
such
titles
as
gossip
mistress
a
relation
an
relation
a
guardian
an
guardian
the
quatergrandfather
the
require
some
slight
elucidation
and
passing
over
the
catalogue
of
articles
of
dress
which
are
denominated
objects
of
man
and
woman
objects
one
may
take
exception
to
crumbs
and
groceries
which
are
inserted
among
plates
and
cruets
as
ordinary
table
garniture
among
what
are
denominated
eatings
we
find
some
wigs
a
dainty
dishes
a
mutton
shoulder
a
little
mine
and
an
amelet
the
is
scarcely
appetising
especially
when
among
fishes
and
shellfishes
our
portuguese
lucullus
sets
down
the
hedgehog
snail
and
wolf
after
this
such
trifles
as
starch
arranged
under
the
heading
of
metals
and
minerals
and
brick
and
whitelead
under
that
of
common
stones
fall
almost
flat
but
one
would
like
to
be
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
gleek
carousal
and
keel
which
are
gravely
asserted
to
be
games
among
chivalry
orders
one
has
a
glimmering
of
what
is
intended
by
saint
michaelmas
and
but
under
the
heading
of
degrees
although
by
a
slight
exercise
of
the
imagination
we
can
picture
to
ourselves
a
quater
master
a
general
to
galeries
or
even
a
vessel
captain
we
are
entirely
nonplussed
by
a
harbinger
and
a
parapet
passing
on
to
familiar
phrases
most
of
which
appear
to
be
old
friends
with
new
faces
senhor
carolino
literal
cribs
from
the
french
become
more
and
more
apparent
in
spite
of
his
boast
in
the
preface
of
being
clean
of
gallicisms
and
despoiled
phrases
apply
you
at
the
study
during
that
you
are
young
is
doubtless
an
excellent
precept
and
as
he
remarks
further
on
how
do
you
can
it
to
deny
but
study
may
be
misdirected
and
in
the
moral
no
less
than
in
the
material
world
it
is
useful
to
know
that
are
the
dishes
whom
you
must
be
and
to
abstain
while
the
meaning
of
this
girl
have
a
beauty
edge
is
scarcely
clear
unless
it
relates
to
the
preternatural
acuteness
of
the
fair
sex
in
these
days
of
board
schools
and
rights
further
on
the
conversationalist
appears
to
get
into
rough
company
and
we
find
him
remarking
he
laughs
at
my
nose
he
jest
by
me
gallicé
me
rit
au
nez
il
se
moque
de
he
has
me
take
out
my
hairs
he
does
me
some
kicks
he
has
scratch
the
face
with
hers
nails
all
doubtless
painfully
translated
with
the
assistance
of
a
dictionary
from
arraché
les
me
donne
des
lacere
la
figure
de
ses
it
is
noticeable
that
our
instructor
as
a
rule
endeavours
to
make
the
possessive
pronoun
agree
with
the
substantive
in
number
and
gender
in
orthodox
portuguese
fashion
and
that
like
a
true
grammatical
patriot
he
insists
upon
the
substantive
having
the
same
gender
as
in
his
native
tongue
therefore
must
be
rendered
hers
nails
and
yours
civilities
by
this
time
no
one
will
be
disposed
to
contradict
our
inimitable
pedro
when
he
remarks
giving
the
translation
as
he
has
the
word
for
to
laugh
a
construction
bearing
a
suspicious
resemblance
to
a
le
mot
pour
he
do
the
devil
at
four
has
no
reference
to
an
artful
scheme
for
circumventing
the
archfiend
at
a
stated
hour
but
is
merely
a
simulacrum
of
the
gallic
idiomatic
expression
fait
le
diable
à
truly
this
is
excellent
fooling
in
his
wildest
humour
backed
by
the
whole
colony
of
leicester
square
could
not
produce
funnier
english
he
burns
one
self
the
brains
he
was
fighted
in
duel
they
fight
one
selfs
together
he
do

would
be
more
intelligible
if
less
picturesque
in
their
original
form
of
se
brûle
la
battu
en
se
battent

de
the
comic
vein
running
through
the
familiar
phrases
is
so
inexhaustible
that
space
forbids
further
quotation
from
this
portion
of
the
book
which
may
be
appropriately
closed
with
help
to
a
little
most
the
better
yours
terms
a
mysterious
adjuration
which
a
reference
to
the
original
portuguese
leads
one
to
suppose
may
be
a
daring
guess
at
un
pen

in
the
second
part
entitled
familiar
dialogues
the
fun
grows
fast
and
furious
let
us
accompany
our
mad
wag
upon
the
walk
you
hear
the
bird
gurgling
he
enquires
and
then
rapturously
exclaims
which
pleasure
which
charm
the
field
has
by
me
a
thousand
charms
after
this
to
the
question
are
you
hunter
will
you
go
to
the
hunting
in
one
day
this
week
he
responds
willingly
i
have
not
a
most
pleasure
in
the
world
there
is
some
game
on
they
cantons
proceeding
from
game
to
gaming
we
soon
run
aground
upon
the
word
which
as
we
know
does
duty
in
french
both
for
a
game
and
a
pack
of
cards
at
what
pack
will
you
that
we
does
play
to
the
cards
of
course
this
is

on

i
have
a
great

excellent
now
let
us
listen
to
our
friend
at
his
tailor
his
greeting
is
perky
almost
slangy
can
you
do
me
a
coat
he
enquires
but
quickly
drivels
down
to
what
cloth
will
you
do
to
and
then
to
the
question
what
will
you
to
double
the
coat
obtains
the
satisfactory
answer
from
something
of
duration
i
believe
to
you
that
after
requesting
to
have
his
garment
the
rather
that
be
possible
he
overwhelms
the
procrastinating
man
of
cloth
with
the
stern
remark
you
have
me
done
to
expect
too
evidently
a
bold
version
of
m
avez
fait

which
draws
forth
the
natural
excuse
i
did
ca
to
come
rather
passing
by
a
number
of
good
things
which
one
would
like
to
analyse

arrive
at
for

after
the
familiar
dialogues
we
come
upon
a
series
of
letters
from
celebrated
personages
who
would
be
puzzled
to
recognize
themselves
in
their
new
dresses
and
a
collection
of
anecdotes
which
may
be
taken
singly
after
dinner
as
a
gentle
promoter
of
digestion
the
whole
being
appropriately
concluded
with
idiotisms
and
proverbs
between
which
it
must
be
confessed
the
distinction
is
purely
imaginary

omitted
and
only
a
sufficient
number
of
the
english
extracts
are
culled
to
enable
the
reader
to
form
a
just
idea
of
the
unintentionally
humorous
style
that
an
author
may
fall
into
who
attempts
to
follow
the
intricacies

is

by
the
aid
of
a
french

phrasebook

to
serve
as
