the

he
to

as
soon
as
it
two
skated
into

other
that
cried
he
aiming
an
apple
at
the
old
man
the
drawer
was
just
one
jewelled
ring
it
lay
on
a
written
monster
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
the
table
stood
the
dazzling
figure
of
a
real
blowzy
frowzy
got
a
face
as
long
as
a
an
object
of
value
and
virtue
this
happened
a
very
little
time
after
we
left
our
humble
home
in
lewisham
and
went
to
live
at
the
blackheath
house
of
our
indian
uncle
which
was
replete
with
every
modern
convenience
and
had
a
big
garden
and
a
great
many
greenhouses
we
had
had
a
lot
of
jolly
christmas
presents
and
one
of
them
was
dicky
from
father
and
it
was
a
not
one
of
the
eighteenpenny
kind
that
never
come
off
but
a
real
that
you
could
have
printed
a
whole
newspaper
out
of
if
you
could
have
been
clever
enough
to
make
up
all
the
stuff
there
is
in
newspapers
i
do
know
how
people
can
do
it
it
all
about
different
things
but
it
is
all
just
the
same
too
but
the
author
is
sorry
to
find
he
is
not
telling
things
from
the
beginning
as
he
has
been
taught
the
really
does
come
into
the
story
till
quite
a
long
way
on
so
it
is
no
use
your
wondering
what
it
was
that
we
did
print
with
the
it
was
not
a
newspaper
anyway
and
it
was
my
young
brother
poetry
though
he
and
the
girls
did
do
an
awful
lot
of
that
it
was
something
much
more
as
you
will
see
if
you
wait
there
was
any
skating
those
holidays
because
it
was
what
they
call
nice
open
weather
that
means
it
was
simply
muggy
and
you
could
play
out
of
doors
without
fussing
about
your
overcoat
or
bringing
you
to
open
shame
in
the
streets
with
knitted
comforters
except
of
course
the
poet
noël
who
is
young
and
equal
to
having
bronchitis
if
he
only
looks
at
a
pair
of
wet
boots
but
the
girls
were
indoors
a
good
deal
trying
to
make
things
for
a
bazaar
which
the
people
our
housekeeper
elder
sister
lives
with
were
having
in
the
country
for
the
benefit
of
a
poor
iron
church
that
was
in
difficulties
and
noël
and
were
with
them
putting
sweets
in
bags
for
the
bazaar
so
dicky
and
i
were
out
alone
together
but
we
were
not
angry
with
the
others
for
their
stuffy
way
of
spending
a
day
two
is
not
a
good
number
though
for
any
game
except
fives
and
the
man
who
ordered
the
vineries
and
pineries
and
butlers
pantries
and
things
never
had
the
sense
to
tell
the
builders
to
make
a
fives
court
some
people
never
think
of
the
simplest
things
so
we
had
been
playing
catch
with
a
fives
ball
it
was
dicky
ball
and
oswald
said
bet
you
ca
hit
it
over
the
house
do
you
bet
said
dicky
and
oswald
replied
you
like
you
could
do
it
anyhow
dicky
said
blake
says
betting
is
wicked
but
i
do
believe
it
is
if
you
do
bet
money
oswald
reminded
him
how
in
edgeworth
even
that
wretched
little
rosamond
who
is
never
allowed
to
do
anything
she
wants
to
even
lose
her
own
needles
makes
a
bet
with
her
brother
and
none
of
the
turn
a
hair
do
want
to
bet
he
said
know
you
ca
do
it
bet
you
my
fives
ball
i
do
dicky
rejoindered
i
bet
you
that
threepenny
ball
of
string
and
the
cobbler
wax
you
were
bothering
about
yesterday
so
dicky
said
and
then
he
went
and
got
a
tennis
racket
when
i
meant
with
his
hands
and
the
ball
soared
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
and
faded
away
but
when
we
went
round
to
look
for
it
we
could
find
it
anywhere
so
he
said
it
had
gone
over
and
he
had
won
and
oswald
thought
it
had
not
gone
over
but
stayed
on
the
roof
and
he
had
and
they
could
not
agree
about
it
though
they
talked
of
nothing
else
till
tea
time
it
was
a
few
days
after
that
that
the
big
greenhouse
began
to
leak
and
something
was
said
at
brekker
about
had
any
of
us
been
throwing
stones
but
it
happened
that
we
had
not
only
after
brek
oswald
said
to
dicky
price
fives
balls
for
knocking
holes
in
greenhouses
you
own
it
went
over
the
house
and
i
won
my
bet
hand
over
dicky
remarked
but
oswald
did
not
see
this
because
it
was
proved
it
was
the
fives
ball
it
was
only
his
idea
then
it
rained
for
two
or
three
days
and
the
greenhouse
leaked
much
more
than
just
a
fives
ball
and
the
said
the
man
who
put
it
up
had
scamped
the
job
and
they
sent
for
him
to
put
it
right
and
when
he
was
ready
he
came
and
men
came
with
ladders
and
putty
and
glass
and
a
thing
to
cut
it
with
a
real
diamond
in
it
that
he
let
us
have
to
look
at
it
was
fine
that
day
and
dicky
and
and
i
were
out
most
of
the
time
talking
to
the
men
i
think
the
men
who
come
to
do
things
to
houses
are
so
interesting
to
talk
to
they
seem
to
know
much
more
about
the
things
that
really
matter
than
gentlemen
do
i
shall
try
to
be
like
them
when
i
grow
up
and
not
always
talk
about
politics
and
the
way
the
army
is
going
to
the
dogs
the
men
were
very
jolly
and
let
us
go
up
the
ladder
and
look
at
the
top
of
the
greenhouse
not
of
course
because
he
is
very
young
indeed
and
wears
socks
when
they
had
gone
to
dinner
went
in
to
see
if
some
pies
were
done
that
he
had
made
out
of
a
bit
of
putty
the
man
gave
him
he
had
put
the
pies
in
the
oven
when
the
cook
looking
i
think
something
must
have
been
done
to
him
for
he
did
not
return
so
dicky
and
i
were
left
dicky
said
i
could
get
the
ladder
round
to
the
roof
of
the
stovehouse
i
believe
i
should
find
my
fives
ball
in
the
gutter
i
it
went
over
the
house
that
day
so
oswald
ever
ready
and
obliging
helped
his
brother
to
move
the
ladder
round
to
the
tiled
roof
of
the
stovehouse
and
dicky
looked
in
the
gutter
but
even
he
could
not
pretend
the
ball
was
there
because
i
am
certain
it
never
went
over
at
all
when
he
came
down
oswald
said
again
and
dicky
said
yourself
you
jolly
well
thought
it
was
there
and
you
have
to
pay
for
it
this
unjustness
was
oswald
reward
for
his
kind
helpingness
about
moving
the
ladder
so
he
turned
away
just
saying
carelessly
over
his
retiring
shoulder
should
think
you
have
the
decency
to
put
the
ladder
back
where
you
found
it
and
he
walked
off
but
he
has
a
generous
heart
a
told
him
so
once
when
he
gave
him
a
halfpenny
and
when
dicky
said
on
oswald
do
be
a
sneak
he
proved
that
he
was
not
one
and
went
back
and
helped
with
the
ladder
but
he
was
a
little
distant
to
dicky
till
all
disagreeableness
was
suddenly
buried
in
a
rat
pincher
found
in
the
cucumber
frame
then
the
bell
rang
and
of
course
we
should
have
gone
in
directly
only
just
then
the
workmen
came
back
from
their
dinner
and
we
waited
because
one
of
them
had
promised
oswald
some
hinges
for
a
ferrets
hutch
he
thought
of
making
and
while
he
was
talking
to
this
man
the
other
one
went
up
the
ladder
and
then
the
most
exciting
and
awful
thing
i
ever
saw
happened
all
in
a
minute
before
anyone
could
have
said
robinson
even
if
they
had
thought
of
him
the
bottom
part
of
the
ladder
slipped
out
along
the
smooth
tiles
by
the
greenhouse
and
there
was
a
long
dreadful
time
when
oswald
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
but
it
could
only
have
been
a
second
really
because
before
anyone
could
do
anything
the
top
end
of
the
ladder
slid
softly
like
cutting
butter
off
the
top
of
the
greenhouse
and
the
man
on
the
ladder
fell
too
i
never
saw
anything
that
made
me
feel
so
wrong
way
up
in
my
inside
he
lay
there
all
in
a
heap
without
moving
and
the
men
crowded
round
him
dicky
and
i
could
not
see
properly
because
of
the
other
men
but
the
foreman
the
one
who
had
given
oswald
the
hinges
said
get
a
doctor
it
always
takes
a
long
time
for
a
workman
to
understand
what
you
want
him
to
do
and
long
before
these
had
oswald
had
shouted
go
and
was
off
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
and
dicky
with
him
they
found
the
doctor
at
home
and
he
came
that
minute
oswald
and
dicky
were
told
to
go
away
but
they
could
not
bear
to
though
they
knew
their
must
have
been
already
rung
for
them
many
times
in
vain
and
it
was
now
ringing
with
fury
they
just
lurked
round
the
corner
of
the
greenhouse
till
the
doctor
said
it
was
a
broken
arm
and
nothing
else
hurt
and
when
the
poor
man
was
sent
home
in
a
cab
oswald
and
dicky
got
the
cabman
who
is
a
friend
of
theirs
to
let
them
come
on
the
box
with
him
and
thus
they
saw
where
the
man
lived
and
saw
his
poor
wife
greet
the
sufferer
she
only
said
gus
whatever
have
you
been
up
to
now
you
always
was
an
unlucky
chap
but
we
could
see
her
loving
heart
was
full
to
overflowing
when
she
had
taken
him
in
and
shut
the
door
we
went
away
the
wretched
sufferer
whose
name
transpired
to
be
augustus
victor
plunkett
was
lucky
enough
to
live
in
a
mews
noël
made
a
poem
about
it
afterwards
muse
of
poetry
do
not
refuse
to
tell
about
a
man
who
loves
the
mews
it
is
his
humble
home
so
poor
and
the
cabman
who
drove
him
home
lives
next
door
but
two
and
when
his
arm
was
broke
his
loving
wife
with
tears
spoke
and
so
on
it
went
on
for
two
hundred
and
lines
and
he
could
not
print
it
because
it
took
far
too
much
type
for
the
it
was
as
we
went
out
of
the
mews
that
we
first
saw
the
goat
i
gave
him
a
piece
of
cocoanut
ice
and
he
liked
it
awfully
he
was
tied
to
a
ring
in
the
wall
and
he
was
black
and
white
with
horns
and
a
beard
and
when
the
man
he
belonged
to
saw
us
looking
at
him
he
said
we
could
have
that
goat
a
bargain
and
when
we
asked
out
of
politeness
and
not
because
we
had
any
money
except
twopence
halfpenny
of
dicky
how
much
he
wanted
for
the
goat
he
said
and
sixpence
is
the
lowest
so
i
wo
deceive
you
young
gents
and
so
help
me
if
he
ai
worth
thribble
the
money
oswald
did
the
sum
in
his
head
which
told
him
the
goat
was
worth
one
pound
two
shillings
and
sixpence
and
he
went
away
sadly
for
he
did
want
that
goat
we
were
later
for
dinner
than
i
ever
remember
our
being
and
miss
blake
had
not
kept
us
any
pudding
but
oswald
bore
up
when
he
thought
of
the
goat
but
dicky
seemed
to
have
no
beautiful
inside
thoughts
to
sustain
him
and
he
was
so
dull
dora
said
she
only
hoped
he
was
going
to
have
measles
it
was
when
we
had
gone
up
to
bed
that
he
fiddled
about
with
the
studs
and
old
buttons
and
things
in
a
velvety
box
he
had
till
oswald
was
in
bed
and
then
he
said
here
oswald
i
feel
as
if
i
was
a
murderer
or
to
it
was
our
moving
that
ladder
i
certain
it
was
and
now
he
laid
up
and
his
wife
and
children
oswald
sat
up
in
bed
and
said
kindly
right
old
chap
it
your
moving
that
ladder
of
course
you
did
put
it
back
firm
but
the
man
not
killed
ought
to
have
touched
it
he
said
we
ought
to
have
told
them
we
had
or
something
suppose
his
arm
gets
or
inflammation
or
something
awful
i
could
go
on
living
if
i
was
a
doer
of
a
deed
like
that
oswald
had
never
seen
dicky
so
upset
he
takes
things
jolly
easy
as
a
rule
oswald
said
it
is
no
use
fuming
over
it
you
better
get
out
of
your
clothes
and
go
to
bed
we
cut
down
in
the
morning
and
leave
our
cards
and
kind
inquiries
oswald
only
meant
to
be
kind
and
by
making
this
amusing
remark
he
wished
to
draw
his
erring
brother
thoughts
from
the
remorse
that
was
poisoning
his
young
life
and
would
very
likely
keep
him
awake
for
an
hour
or
more
thinking
of
it
and
fidgetting
about
so
that
oswald
could
sleep
but
dicky
did
not
take
it
at
all
the
way
oswald
meant
he
said
up
oswald
you
beast
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
and
began
to
blub
oswald
said
yourself
because
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
say
but
he
was
not
angry
only
sorry
that
dicky
was
so
duffing
as
not
to
see
what
he
meant
and
he
got
out
of
bed
and
went
softly
to
the
girls
room
which
is
next
ours
and
said
say
come
in
to
our
room
a
will
you
dicky
is
howling
fit
to
bring
the
house
down
i
think
a
council
of
us
elder
ones
would
do
him
more
good
than
anything
is
up
dora
asked
getting
into
her
nothing
except
that
he
a
murderer
come
on
and
do
make
a
row
mind
the
mats
and
our
boots
by
the
door
they
came
in
and
oswald
said
here
dicky
old
boy
here
are
the
girls
and
we
going
to
have
a
council
about
it
they
wanted
to
kiss
him
but
he
would
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
about
and
would
speak
but
when
alice
had
got
hold
of
his
hand
he
said
in
a
muffled
voice
tell
them
oswald
when
oswald
and
dicky
were
alone
you
will
have
noticed
the
just
elder
brother
blamed
the
proper
person
which
was
dicky
because
he
would
go
up
on
the
stovehouse
roof
after
his
beastly
ball
which
oswald
did
not
care
a
rap
about
and
besides
he
knew
it
was
there
but
now
that
other
people
were
there
oswald
of
course
said
see
moved
the
men
ladder
when
they
were
at
their
dinner
and
you
know
the
man
that
fell
off
the
ladder
and
we
went
with
him
in
the
cab
to
the
place
where
that
goat
was
well
dicky
has
only
just
thought
of
it
but
of
course
it
was
really
our
fault
his
tumbling
because
we
could
have
put
the
ladder
back
safely
and
dicky
thinks
if
his
arm
itself
we
should
be
as
good
as
murderers
dicky
is
perfectly
straight
he
sat
up
and
sniffed
and
blew
his
nose
and
said
was
my
idea
moving
the
ladder
oswald
only
helped
we
ask
uncle
to
see
that
the
dear
sufferer
wants
for
nothing
while
he
ill
and
all
that
said
dora
said
oswald
could
of
course
but
then
it
would
all
come
out
and
about
the
fives
ball
too
and
we
ca
be
at
all
sure
it
the
ball
made
the
greenhouse
leak
because
i
know
it
never
went
over
the
house
it
did
said
dicky
giving
his
nose
a
last
stern
blow
oswald
was
generous
to
a
sorrowing
foe
and
took
no
notice
only
went
on
about
the
ladder
we
ca
be
quite
sure
it
would
have
slipped
on
those
tiles
even
if
we
never
moved
it
but
i
think
dicky
would
feel
jollier
if
we
could
do
something
for
the
man
and
i
know
it
would
me
that
looks
mixed
but
oswald
was
rather
agitated
himself
and
that
was
what
he
said
must
think
of
something
to
do
to
get
money
alice
said
we
used
to
do
when
we
were
presently
the
girls
went
away
and
we
heard
them
jawing
in
their
room
just
as
oswald
was
falling
asleep
the
door
opened
and
a
figure
in
white
came
in
and
bent
above
his
almost
sleeping
form
it
said
thought
of
something
we
have
a
bazaar
like
the
people
miss
blake
elder
sister
lives
with
did
for
the
poor
iron
church
the
form
glided
away
miss
blake
is
our
housekeeper
oswald
could
hear
that
dicky
was
already
sleeping
so
he
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
himself
he
dreamed
of
goats
only
they
were
as
big
as
railway
engines
and
would
keep
ringing
the
church
bells
till
oswald
awoke
and
it
was
the
bell
and
not
a
great
goat
ringing
it
but
only
sarah
as
usual
the
idea
of
the
bazaar
seemed
to
please
all
of
us
can
ask
all
the
people
we
know
to
it
said
alice
wear
our
best
frocks
and
sell
the
things
at
the
stalls
said
dora
dicky
said
we
could
have
it
in
the
big
greenhouse
now
the
plants
were
out
of
it
will
write
a
poem
for
the
man
and
say
it
at
the
bazaar
noël
said
know
people
say
poetry
at
bazaars
the
one
aunt
carrie
took
me
to
a
man
said
a
piece
about
a
cowboy
said
there
ought
to
be
lots
of
sweets
and
then
everyone
would
buy
them
oswald
said
someone
would
have
to
ask
my
father
and
he
said
he
would
do
it
if
the
others
liked
he
did
this
because
of
an
inside
feeling
in
his
mind
that
he
knew
might
come
on
at
any
moment
so
he
did
and
was
the
answer
and
then
the
uncle
gave
oswald
a
whole
quid
to
buy
things
to
sell
at
the
bazaar
and
my
father
gave
him
ten
bob
for
the
same
useful
and
generous
purpose
and
said
he
was
glad
to
see
we
were
trying
to
do
good
to
others
when
he
said
that
the
inside
feeling
in
oswald
mind
began
that
he
had
felt
afraid
would
some
time
and
he
told
my
father
about
him
and
dicky
moving
the
ladder
and
about
the
hateful
fives
ball
and
everything
and
my
father
was
awfully
decent
about
it
so
that
oswald
was
glad
he
had
told
the
girls
wrote
the
invitations
to
all
our
friends
that
very
day
we
boys
went
down
to
look
in
the
shops
and
see
what
we
could
buy
for
the
bazaar
and
we
went
to
ask
how
augustus
victor
plunkett
arm
was
getting
on
and
to
see
the
goat
the
others
liked
the
goat
almost
as
much
as
oswald
and
even
dicky
agreed
that
it
was
our
clear
duty
to
buy
the
goat
for
the
sake
of
poor
plunkett
because
as
oswald
said
if
it
was
worth
one
pound
two
and
six
we
could
easily
sell
it
again
for
that
and
we
should
have
gained
fifteen
shillings
for
the
sufferer
so
we
bought
the
goat
and
changed
the
ten
shillings
to
do
it
the
man
untied
the
other
end
of
the
goat
rope
and
oswald
took
hold
of
it
and
said
he
hoped
we
were
not
robbing
the
man
by
taking
his
goat
from
him
for
such
a
low
price
and
he
said
at
all
young
gents
do
you
mention
it
pleased
to
oblige
a
friend
any
day
of
the
week
so
we
started
to
take
the
goat
home
but
after
about
half
a
street
he
would
not
come
any
more
he
stopped
still
and
a
lot
of
boys
and
people
came
round
just
as
if
they
had
never
seen
a
goat
before
we
were
beginning
to
feel
quite
uncomfortable
when
oswald
remembered
the
goat
liked
cocoanut
ice
so
noël
went
into
a
shop
and
got
and
then
the
cheap
animal
consented
to
follow
us
home
so
did
the
street
boys
the
cocoanut
ice
was
more
for
the
money
than
usual
but
not
so
nice
my
father
was
not
pleased
when
he
saw
the
goat
but
when
alice
told
him
it
was
for
the
bazaar
he
laughed
and
let
us
keep
it
in
the
stableyard
it
got
out
early
in
the
morning
and
came
right
into
the
house
and
butted
the
cook
in
her
own
a
thing
even
oswald
himself
would
have
hesitated
before
doing
so
that
showed
it
was
a
brave
goat
the
groom
did
not
like
the
goat
because
it
bit
a
hole
in
a
sack
of
corn
and
then
walked
up
it
like
up
a
mountain
and
all
the
oats
ran
out
and
got
between
the
stones
of
the
stableyard
and
there
was
a
row
but
we
explained
it
was
not
for
long
as
the
bazaar
was
in
three
days
and
we
hurried
to
get
things
ready
we
were
each
to
have
a
stall
dora
took
the
refreshment
stall
the
uncle
made
miss
blake
get
all
that
ready
alice
had
a
stall
for
pincushions
and
bags
and
other
useless
things
that
girls
make
with
stuff
and
ribbons
noël
had
a
poetry
stall
where
you
could
pay
twopence
and
get
a
piece
of
poetry
and
a
sweet
wrapped
up
in
it
we
chose
sugar
almonds
because
they
are
not
so
sticky
h
o
stall
was
to
be
sweets
if
he
promised
on
his
word
of
honour
as
a
bastable
only
to
eat
one
of
each
kind
dicky
wished
to
have
a
stall
for
mechanical
toys
and
parts
of
clocks
he
has
a
great
many
parts
of
clocks
but
the
only
mechanical
toy
was
his
clockwork
engine
that
was
broken
ages
ago
so
he
had
to
give
it
up
and
he
could
think
of
anything
else
so
he
settled
to
help
oswald
and
keep
an
eye
on
oswald
stall
was
meant
to
be
a
stall
for
really
useful
things
but
in
the
end
it
was
just
a
lumber
stall
for
the
things
other
people
did
not
want
but
he
did
not
mind
because
the
others
agreed
he
should
have
the
entire
selling
of
the
goat
and
he
racked
his
young
brains
to
think
how
to
sell
it
in
the
most
interesting
and
unusual
way
and
at
last
he
saw
how
and
he
said
shall
be
a
lottery
and
we
make
people
take
tickets
and
then
draw
a
secret
number
out
of
a
hat
and
whoever
gets
the
right
number
gets
the
goat
i
wish
it
was
me
ought
to
advertise
it
though
dicky
said
handbills
printed
and
send
out
oswald
inquired
at
the
printers
in
greenwich
and
handbills
were
an
awful
price
and
a
luxury
far
beyond
our
means
so
he
went
home
sadly
and
then
alice
thought
of
the
we
got
it
out
and
cleaned
it
where
the
ink
had
been
upset
into
it
and
mended
the
broken
parts
as
well
as
we
could
and
got
some
more
printers
ink
and
wrote
the
circular
and
printed
it
it
was
secret
lottery
exceptionable
and
rare
chance
object
of
value
ought
to
be
object
of
said
dicky
saw
it
in
the
old
iron
and
china
and
picture
shop
it
was
a
carved
ivory
ship
and
there
was
a
ticket
on
it
rare
object
of
virtue
goat
an
object
certainly
alice
said
it
valuable
as
for
virtue
i
not
so
sure
but
oswald
thought
the
two
v
looked
well
and
being
virtuous
is
different
to
being
valuable
but
all
the
same
the
goat
might
be
both
when
you
got
to
know
him
really
well
so
we
put
it
in
secret
lottery
exceptionable
and
rare
chance
object
of
value
and
will
be
lotteried
for
on
saturday
next
at
four
tickets
one
or
two
shillings
each
according
to
how
many
people
want
them
the
object
is
not
disclosed
till
after
the
lottery
but
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
and
is
honestly
worth
three
times
as
much
if
you
win
it
it
is
the
same
as
winning
money
apply
at
morden
house
blackheath
at
next
saturday
take
tickets
early
to
prevent
disappointment
we
printed
these
and
though
they
looked
a
bit
rum
we
had
not
time
to
do
them
again
so
we
went
out
about
dusk
and
dropped
them
in
then
next
day
oswald
who
is
always
very
keen
on
doing
the
thing
well
got
two
out
of
the
kitchen
and
bored
holes
in
them
with
an
auger
i
had
and
pasted
paper
on
them
and
did
on
them
with
a
and
ink
the
following
lines
secret
lottery
object
of
value
and
virtue
and
if
you
win
it
will
be
the
same
as
winning
money
lottery
at
morden
house
blackheath
saturday
at
come
at
and
he
slung
the
boards
round
his
neck
and
tied
up
his
mouth
in
one
of
those
knitted
comforters
he
despises
so
much
at
other
times
and
pulling
a
cap
of
father
over
his
bold
ears
he
got
dicky
to
let
him
out
of
the
and
then
the
brave
boy
went
right
across
the
heath
and
three
times
up
and
down
the
village
till
those
boys
that
followed
him
and
the
goat
home
went
for
him
near
the
corner
of
wemyss
road
and
he
made
a
fight
for
it
taking
off
the
boards
and
using
them
as
shields
but
at
last
being
far
outnumbered
which
is
no
disgrace
he
had
to
chuck
the
boards
and
run
for
it
saturday
was
fine
we
had
hung
the
greenhouse
with
evergreens
and
paper
roses
that
looked
almost
like
real
among
the
green
and
miss
blake
let
us
have
some
curtains
to
cover
over
the
shelves
and
staging
with
and
the
gardener
let
us
have
a
lot
of
azaleas
and
things
in
pots
so
that
it
was
all
very
bowery
and
flowery
alice
stall
was
the
smartest
looking
because
miss
blake
had
let
her
have
all
the
ribbons
and
things
that
were
over
from
the
other
bazaar
h
o
stall
was
also
nice
all
on
silver
so
as
not
to
be
stickier
than
needful
the
poetry
stall
had
more
flowers
on
it
than
any
of
the
others
to
make
up
for
the
poetry
looking
so
dull
outside
of
course
you
could
not
see
the
sweet
inside
the
packets
till
you
opened
them
red
azaleas
are
prettier
than
poetry
i
think
i
think
the
tropic
lands
in
ho
had
great
trees
with
flowers
like
that
we
got
the
goat
into
the
stovehouse
he
was
to
be
kept
a
secret
till
the
very
last
and
by
two
we
were
all
ready
and
very
clean
and
dressed
we
had
all
looked
out
everything
we
thought
anyone
could
want
to
buy
and
that
we
could
spare
and
some
things
we
could
not
and
most
of
these
were
on
oswald
table
among
others
several
boxes
of
games
we
had
never
cared
about
some
bags
of
marbles
which
nobody
plays
now
a
lot
of
old
books
a
pair
of
braces
with
on
them
that
an
aunt
once
made
for
oswald
and
of
course
he
could
wear
them
some
bags
of
odd
buttons
for
people
who
like
sewing
these
things
on
a
lot
of
foreign
stamps
gardening
tools
dicky
engine
that
wo
go
and
a
stuffed
parrot
but
he
was
about
three
our
friends
began
to
come
leslie
and
lord
tottenham
and
albert
uncle
and
a
lot
of
others
it
was
a
very
grand
party
and
they
admired
the
bazaar
very
much
and
all
bought
things
leslie
bought
the
engine
for
ten
shillings
though
we
told
her
honestly
it
would
never
go
again
and
albert
uncle
bought
the
parrot
and
would
not
tell
us
what
he
wanted
it
for
the
money
was
put
on
a
blue
dish
so
that
everyone
could
see
how
it
got
on
and
our
hearts
were
full
of
joy
as
we
saw
how
much
silver
there
was
among
the
pennies
and
two
or
three
gold
pieces
too
i
know
now
how
the
man
feels
who
holds
the
plate
at
the
door
in
church
noël
poetry
stall
was
much
more
paying
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
believe
nobody
really
likes
poetry
and
yet
everyone
pretends
they
do
either
so
as
not
to
hurt
noël
feelings
or
because
they
think
people
ought
to
like
poetry
even
noël
of
course
macaulay
and
kipling
are
different
i
do
mind
them
so
much
myself
noël
wrote
a
lot
of
new
poetry
for
the
bazaar
it
took
up
all
his
time
and
even
then
he
had
not
enough
new
stuff
to
wrap
up
all
the
sugar
almonds
in
so
he
made
up
with
old
poetry
that
he
done
before
albert
uncle
got
one
of
the
new
ones
and
said
it
made
him
a
proud
man
it
was
noble
and
good
and
kind
you
are
to
come
to
victor
plunkett
bazaar
please
buy
as
much
as
you
can
bear
for
the
sufferer
needs
all
you
can
possibly
spare
i
know
you
are
sure
to
take
his
part
because
you
have
such
a
noble
heart
leslie
got
rose
is
red
the
violet
blue
the
lily
pale
and
so
are
you
or
would
be
if
you
had
seen
him
fall
off
the
top
of
the
ladder
so
tall
do
buy
as
much
as
you
can
stand
and
lend
the
poor
a
helping
hand
lord
tottenham
though
only
got
one
of
the
old
ones
and
it
happened
to
be
the
of
the
he
was
an
admiral
once
but
he
liked
it
he
is
a
nice
old
gentleman
but
people
do
say
he
is
father
got
a
poem
that
said
turn
your
eyes
round
in
their
sockets
and
put
both
your
hands
in
your
pockets
your
eyes
will
show
you
things
so
gay
and
i
hope
you
find
enough
in
your
pockets
to
pay
for
the
things
you
buy
and
he
laughed
and
seemed
pleased
but
when
morrison
mother
got
that
poem
about
the
black
beetle
that
was
poisoned
she
was
not
so
pleased
and
she
said
it
was
horrid
and
made
her
flesh
creep
you
know
the
poem
it
says
beetle
how
i
weep
to
see
thee
lying
on
thy
poor
back
it
is
so
very
sad
to
see
you
were
so
leggy
and
black
i
wish
you
were
crawling
about
alive
again
but
many
people
think
this
is
nonsense
and
a
shame
noël
recite
no
matter
what
we
said
and
he
stood
up
on
a
chair
and
everyone
in
their
blind
generousness
paid
sixpence
to
hear
him
it
was
a
long
poem
of
his
own
about
the
duke
of
wellington
and
it
began
faithful
leader
of
the
brave
band
who
went
to
make
napoleon
understand
he
could
have
everything
his
own
way
we
taught
him
this
on
waterloo
day
i
heard
that
much
but
then
he
got
so
upset
and
frightened
no
one
could
hear
anything
till
the
end
when
it
says
praise
the
heroes
of
waterloo
and
let
us
do
our
duty
like
they
had
to
do
everyone
clapped
very
much
but
noël
was
so
upset
he
nearly
cried
and
leslie
said
i
feeling
as
pale
as
a
lily
again
take
me
round
the
garden
to
recover
myself
she
was
as
red
as
usual
but
it
saved
noël
from
making
a
young
ass
of
himself
and
we
got
seventeen
shillings
and
sixpence
by
his
reciting
so
that
was
all
right
we
might
as
well
not
have
sent
out
those
circulars
because
only
the
people
we
had
written
to
ourselves
came
of
course
i
do
count
those
five
street
boys
the
same
oswald
had
the
fight
with
they
came
and
they
walked
round
and
looked
at
the
things
but
they
had
no
money
to
spend
it
turned
out
and
only
came
to
be
disagreeable
and
make
fun
so
albert
uncle
asked
them
if
they
did
not
think
their
families
would
be
lonely
without
them
and
he
and
i
saw
them
off
at
the
gate
then
they
stood
outside
and
made
rude
noises
and
another
stranger
came
and
oswald
thought
perhaps
the
circular
was
beginning
to
bear
fruit
but
the
stranger
asked
for
the
master
of
the
house
and
he
was
shown
in
oswald
was
just
shaking
up
the
numbers
in
his
hat
for
the
lottery
of
the
goat
and
alice
and
dora
were
selling
the
tickets
for
half
a
crown
each
to
our
visitors
and
explaining
the
dreadful
misery
of
the
poor
man
that
all
this
trouble
was
being
taken
for
and
we
were
all
enjoying
ourselves
very
much
when
sarah
came
to
say
master
oswald
was
to
go
in
to
master
study
at
once
so
he
went
wondering
what
on
earth
he
could
have
been
up
to
now
but
he
could
not
think
of
anything
in
particular
but
when
his
father
said
this
gentleman
is
a
detective
from
scotland
yard
he
was
glad
he
had
told
about
the
fives
ball
and
the
ladder
because
he
knew
his
father
would
now
stand
by
him
but
he
did
wonder
whether
you
could
be
sent
to
prison
for
leaving
a
ladder
in
a
slippery
place
and
how
long
they
would
keep
you
there
for
that
crime
then
my
father
held
out
one
of
the
fatal
circulars
and
said
suppose
this
is
some
of
your
work
biggs
here
is
bound
in
honour
to
do
his
best
to
find
out
when
people
break
the
laws
of
the
land
now
lotteries
are
illegal
and
can
be
punished
by
law
oswald
gloomily
wondered
how
much
the
law
could
do
to
you
he
said
did
know
father
then
his
father
said
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
tell
this
gentleman
all
about
it
so
oswald
said
victor
plunkett
fell
off
a
ladder
and
broke
his
arm
and
perhaps
it
was
our
fault
for
meddling
with
the
ladder
at
all
so
we
wanted
to
do
something
to
help
him
and
father
said
we
might
have
a
bazaar
it
is
happening
now
and
we
had
three
pounds
two
and
sevenpence
last
time
i
counted
the
bazaar
what
about
the
lottery
said
biggs
who
did
not
look
as
if
he
would
take
oswald
to
prison
just
then
as
our
young
hero
had
feared
in
fact
he
looked
rather
jolly
the
prize
money
oh
no
only
it
so
valuable
it
as
good
as
winning
money
it
only
a
raffle
said
biggs
what
it
is
just
a
plain
raffle
what
the
prize
we
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
with
it
asked
the
wary
oswald
yes
said
biggs
it
not
money
why
not
what
is
the
valuable
object
oswald
said
his
father
when
oswald
said
nothing
is
the
object
of
rather
not
say
said
oswald
feeling
very
uncomfortable
biggs
said
something
about
duty
being
duty
and
my
father
said
oswald
do
be
a
young
duffer
i
dare
say
it
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
should
think
not
indeed
said
oswald
as
his
fond
thoughts
played
with
that
beautiful
goat
then
sir
oswald
spoke
desperately
for
he
wondered
his
father
had
been
so
patient
so
long
and
saw
that
he
was
going
to
go
on
being
see
the
great
thing
is
nobody
is
to
know
it
a
g
i
mean
it
a
secret
no
one
to
know
what
the
prize
is
only
when
you
won
it
it
will
be
revealed
said
my
father
biggs
will
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
me
we
follow
you
down
to
the
greenhouse
and
he
can
see
for
himself
biggs
said
something
about
thanking
father
kindly
and
about
his
duty
and
presently
they
came
down
to
the
greenhouse
father
did
not
introduce
biggs
to
anyone
i
suppose
he
forgot
but
oswald
did
while
father
was
talking
to
leslie
and
biggs
made
himself
very
agreeable
to
all
the
ladies
then
we
had
the
lottery
everyone
had
tickets
and
alice
asked
biggs
to
buy
one
she
let
him
have
it
for
a
shilling
because
it
was
the
last
and
we
all
hoped
he
would
win
the
goat
he
seemed
quite
sure
now
that
oswald
was
not
kidding
and
that
the
prize
was
not
money
indeed
oswald
went
so
far
as
to
tell
him
privately
that
the
prize
was
too
big
to
put
in
your
pocket
and
that
if
it
was
divided
up
it
would
be
spoiled
which
is
true
of
goats
but
not
of
money
illustration
here
is
your
prize
said
oswald
page
everyone
was
laughing
and
talking
and
wondering
anxiously
whatever
the
prize
could
possibly
be
oswald
carried
round
the
hat
and
everyone
drew
a
number
the
winning
number
was
six
hundred
and
and
albert
uncle
said
afterwards
it
was
a
curious
coincidence
i
know
what
it
meant
but
it
made
leslie
laugh
when
everyone
had
drawn
a
number
oswald
rang
the
to
command
silence
and
there
was
a
hush
full
of
anxious
expectation
then
oswald
said
prize
number
is
six
hundred
and
who
has
it
and
biggs
took
a
step
forward
and
held
out
his
paper
prize
is
yours
i
congratulate
you
said
oswald
warmly
then
he
went
into
the
stovehouse
and
hastily
placing
a
wreath
of
paper
roses
on
the
goat
head
that
alice
had
got
ready
for
the
purpose
he
got
out
the
goat
by
secretly
showing
it
a
bit
of
cocoanut
ice
and
led
it
by
the
same
means
to
the
feet
of
the
happy
winner
is
your
prize
said
oswald
with
feelings
of
generous
pride
am
very
glad
you
got
him
he
be
a
comfort
to
you
and
make
up
for
all
the
trouble
you
had
over
our
lottery
raffle
i
mean
and
he
placed
the
ungoated
end
of
the
rope
in
the
unresisting
hand
of
the
fortunate
detective
neither
oswald
nor
any
of
the
rest
of
us
has
ever
been
able
to
make
out
why
everyone
should
have
laughed
so
but
they
did
they
said
the
lottery
was
the
success
of
the
afternoon
and
the
ladies
kept
on
congratulating
biggs
at
last
people
began
to
go
and
the
detective
so
unexpectedly
made
rich
beyond
his
wildest
dreams
said
he
too
must
be
going
he
had
tied
the
goat
to
the
greenhouse
door
and
now
he
moved
away
but
we
all
cried
out
forgotten
your
goat
i
have
he
said
very
earnestly
shall
never
forget
that
goat
to
my
dying
hour
but
i
want
to
call
on
my
aunt
just
close
by
and
i
could
very
well
take
the
goat
to
see
her
do
see
why
not
said
a
very
nice
goat
frightened
of
them
said
he
ran
at
her
when
she
was
a
little
girl
but
if
you
will
allow
me
sir
and
he
winked
at
my
father
which
is
not
manners
you
allow
me
i
call
in
for
the
goat
on
my
way
to
the
station
we
got
five
pounds
thirteen
and
fivepence
by
the
bazaar
and
the
raffle
we
should
have
had
another
ten
shillings
from
father
but
he
had
to
give
it
to
biggs
because
we
had
put
him
to
the
trouble
of
coming
all
the
way
from
scotland
yard
because
he
thought
our
circular
was
from
some
hardened
criminal
wishing
to
cheat
his
trustful
we
took
the
money
to
augustus
victor
plunkett
next
morning
and
i
tell
you
he
pleased
we
waited
till
long
after
dark
for
the
detective
to
return
for
his
rich
prize
but
he
never
came
i
hope
he
was
not
set
upon
and
stabbed
in
some
dark
alley
if
he
is
alive
and
not
imprisoned
i
ca
see
why
he
did
come
back
i
often
think
anxiously
of
him
because
of
course
detectives
have
many
enemies
among
felons
who
think
nothing
of
stabbing
people
in
the
back
so
that
being
murdered
in
a
dark
alley
is
a
thing
all
detectives
are
constantly
liable
to
the
runaways
it
was
after
we
had
had
the
measles
that
fell
and
blighting
disorder
which
we
got
from
alice
picking
up
five
deeply
infected
shillings
that
a
bemeasled
family
had
wrapped
in
a
bit
of
paper
to
pay
the
doctor
with
and
then
carelessly
dropped
in
the
street
alice
held
the
packet
hotly
in
her
muff
all
through
a
charity
concert
hence
these
tears
as
it
says
in
virgil
and
if
you
have
ever
had
measles
you
will
know
that
this
is
not
what
is
called
figuring
speech
because
your
eyes
do
run
like
mad
all
the
time
when
we
were
unmeasled
again
we
were
sent
to
stay
at
lymchurch
with
a
miss
sandal
and
her
motto
was
plain
living
and
high
thinking
she
had
a
brother
and
his
motto
was
the
same
and
it
was
his
charity
concert
that
alice
held
the
fatal
shillings
in
her
muff
throughout
of
later
on
he
was
giving
tracts
to
a
bricklayer
and
fell
off
a
scaffold
in
his
giddy
earnestness
and
miss
sandal
had
to
go
and
nurse
him
so
the
six
of
us
stayed
in
the
plain
living
high
thinking
house
by
ourselves
and
old
beale
from
the
village
came
in
every
day
and
did
the
housework
she
was
of
humble
birth
but
was
a
true
lady
in
minding
her
own
affairs
which
is
what
a
great
many
ladies
do
not
know
how
to
do
at
all
we
had
no
lessons
to
do
and
we
were
thus
free
to
attend
to
any
adventures
which
came
along
adventures
are
the
real
business
of
life
the
rest
is
only
what
albert
uncle
calls
padding
he
is
an
author
miss
sandal
house
was
very
plain
and
clean
with
lots
of
white
paint
and
very
difficult
to
play
in
so
we
were
out
a
good
deal
it
was
seaside
so
of
course
there
was
the
beach
and
besides
that
the
marsh
big
green
fields
with
sheep
all
about
and
wet
dykes
with
sedge
growing
and
mud
and
eels
in
the
mud
and
winding
white
roads
that
all
look
the
same
and
all
very
interesting
as
though
they
might
lead
to
almost
anything
that
you
did
expect
really
of
course
they
lead
to
ashford
and
romney
and
ivychurch
and
real
live
places
like
that
but
they
do
look
it
the
day
when
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
happened
we
were
all
leaning
on
the
stone
wall
looking
at
the
pigs
the
pigman
is
a
great
friend
of
ours
all
except
who
is
my
youngest
brother
his
name
is
horace
octavius
and
if
you
want
to
know
why
we
called
him
you
had
better
read
treasure
seekers
and
find
out
he
had
gone
to
tea
with
the
schoolmaster
son
a
hateful
kid
that
the
boy
you
always
fighting
dora
asked
when
said
he
was
going
said
then
he
keeps
rabbits
so
then
we
understood
and
let
him
go
well
the
rest
of
us
were
gazing
fondly
on
the
pigs
and
two
soldiers
came
by
we
asked
them
where
they
were
off
to
they
told
us
to
mind
our
own
business
which
is
not
manners
even
if
you
are
a
soldier
on
private
affairs
all
right
said
oswald
who
is
the
eldest
and
he
advised
the
soldiers
to
keep
their
hair
on
the
little
they
had
was
cut
very
short
expect
they
scouts
or
something
said
dicky
a
or
a
or
something
as
likely
as
not
go
after
them
and
see
said
oswald
ever
prompt
in
his
decidings
so
we
did
we
ran
a
bit
at
first
so
as
not
to
let
the
soldiers
have
too
much
of
a
lead
their
red
coats
made
it
quite
easy
to
keep
them
in
sight
on
the
winding
white
marsh
road
but
we
did
not
catch
them
up
they
seemed
to
go
faster
and
faster
so
we
ran
a
little
bit
more
every
now
and
then
and
we
went
quite
a
long
way
after
them
but
they
did
meet
any
of
their
officers
or
regiments
or
things
and
we
began
to
think
that
perchance
we
were
engaged
in
the
disheartening
chase
of
the
wild
goose
this
has
sometimes
occurred
there
is
a
ruined
church
about
two
miles
from
lymchurch
and
when
we
got
close
to
that
we
lost
sight
of
the
red
coats
so
we
stopped
on
the
little
bridge
that
is
near
there
to
reconnoitre
the
soldiers
had
vanished
here
a
go
said
dicky
a
chase
said
noël
shall
make
a
piece
of
poetry
about
it
i
shall
call
the
title
the
vanishing
reds
or
the
soldiers
that
were
not
when
you
got
there
shut
up
said
oswald
whose
eagle
eye
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
scarlet
through
the
arch
of
the
ruin
none
of
the
others
had
seen
this
perhaps
you
will
think
i
do
not
say
enough
about
oswald
quickness
of
sight
so
i
had
better
tell
you
that
is
only
because
oswald
is
me
and
very
modest
at
least
he
tries
to
be
because
he
knows
it
is
what
a
true
gentleman
ought
to
in
the
ruins
he
went
on
expect
they
going
to
have
an
easy
and
a
pipe
out
of
the
wind
think
it
very
mysterious
said
noël
should
wonder
if
they
going
to
dig
for
buried
treasure
let
go
and
see
said
oswald
who
though
modest
is
thoughtful
we
do
stop
digging
or
whatever
they
doing
when
they
gone
away
go
and
see
if
the
ground
is
scratched
about
so
we
delayed
where
we
were
but
we
saw
no
more
scarlet
in
a
little
while
a
man
in
brown
came
by
on
a
bicycle
he
stopped
and
got
off
a
couple
of
tommies
about
here
my
lad
he
said
to
oswald
oswald
does
not
like
being
called
anybody
lad
especially
that
kind
of
man
but
he
did
not
want
to
spoil
the
review
or
or
or
whatever
it
might
be
so
he
said
they
up
in
the
ruins
do
say
so
said
the
man
uniform
i
suppose
yes
of
course
or
you
would
have
known
they
were
soldiers
silly
cuckoos
he
wheeled
his
bicycle
up
the
rough
lane
that
leads
to
the
old
ruin
ca
be
buried
treasure
said
dicky
do
care
if
it
is
said
oswald
see
what
happening
i
do
mind
spoiling
sport
my
ladding
me
like
that
so
we
followed
the
man
with
the
bicycle
it
was
leaning
against
the
churchyard
gate
when
we
got
there
the
man
off
it
was
going
up
to
the
ruin
and
we
went
after
him
he
did
not
call
out
to
the
soldiers
and
we
thought
that
odd
but
it
did
make
us
think
where
it
might
have
made
us
if
we
had
had
any
sense
he
just
went
creeping
about
looking
behind
walls
and
inside
arches
as
though
he
was
playing
at
there
is
a
mound
in
the
middle
of
the
ruin
where
stones
and
things
have
fallen
during
dark
ages
and
the
grass
has
grown
all
over
them
we
stood
on
the
mound
and
watched
the
bicycling
stranger
nosing
about
like
a
ferret
there
is
an
archway
in
that
ruin
and
a
flight
of
steps
goes
down
only
five
steps
and
then
it
is
all
stopped
up
with
fallen
stones
and
earth
the
stranger
stopped
at
last
at
this
arch
and
stooped
forward
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
looked
through
the
arch
and
down
the
steps
then
he
said
suddenly
and
fiercely
out
of
it
will
you
and
the
soldiers
came
i
would
have
they
were
two
to
his
one
they
came
cringing
out
like
beaten
dogs
the
brown
man
made
a
sort
of
bound
and
next
minute
the
two
soldiers
were
handcuffed
together
and
he
was
driving
them
before
him
like
sheep
you
go
the
same
way
as
what
you
come
he
said
and
then
oswald
saw
the
soldiers
faces
and
he
will
never
forget
what
they
looked
like
he
jumped
off
the
mound
and
ran
to
where
they
were
have
they
done
he
asked
the
handcuffer
said
the
man
to
you
my
lad
i
got
as
easy
as
kiss
your
hand
then
one
of
the
soldiers
looked
at
oswald
he
was
not
very
old
about
as
big
as
a
boy
and
oswald
answered
what
the
soldier
looked
at
him
a
sneak
he
said
would
have
told
if
i
known
if
you
told
me
instead
of
saying
to
mind
my
own
business
i
have
helped
you
the
soldier
did
answer
but
the
bicycle
man
did
you
helped
yourself
into
the
stone
jug
my
lad
said
he
a
dirty
deserter
you
young
enough
to
know
better
come
along
you
rubbish
and
they
went
when
they
were
gone
dicky
said
very
rum
i
hate
cowards
and
deserters
are
cowards
i
do
see
why
we
feel
like
this
alice
and
dora
and
noël
were
now
discovered
to
be
in
tears
course
we
did
right
to
tell
only
when
the
soldier
looked
at
me
said
oswald
said
dicky
just
it
in
deepest
gloom
the
party
retraced
its
steps
as
we
went
dora
said
with
sniffs
suppose
it
was
the
bicycle
man
duty
course
said
oswald
it
was
duty
and
i
jolly
well
wish
we
had
such
a
beautiful
day
too
said
noël
sniffing
in
his
turn
it
beautiful
the
afternoon
had
been
dull
but
now
the
sun
was
shining
flat
across
the
marshes
making
everything
look
as
if
it
had
been
covered
all
over
with
the
best
marsh
and
trees
and
roofs
and
stacks
and
everything
that
evening
noël
wrote
a
poem
about
it
all
it
began
soldiers
why
did
you
run
away
on
such
a
beautiful
beautiful
day
if
you
had
run
away
in
the
rain
perhaps
they
would
never
have
found
you
again
because
then
oswald
would
not
have
been
there
to
show
the
hunter
the
way
to
your
lair
oswald
would
have
licked
him
for
that
only
noël
is
not
very
strong
and
there
is
something
about
poets
however
young
that
makes
it
rather
like
licking
a
girl
so
oswald
did
not
even
say
what
he
thought
noël
cries
at
the
least
thing
oswald
only
said
go
down
to
our
pigman
and
we
all
went
except
noël
he
never
will
go
anywhere
when
in
the
midst
of
making
poetry
and
alice
stayed
with
him
and
was
in
bed
we
told
the
pigman
all
about
the
deserters
and
about
our
miserable
inside
remorsefulness
and
he
said
he
knew
just
how
we
felt
quite
enough
agin
a
pore
chap
that
made
a
bolt
of
it
without
the
rest
of
us
in
he
said
as
i
holds
with
deserting
mean
trick
i
call
it
but
all
the
same
when
the
odds
is
that
heavy
thousands
to
one
all
the
army
and
the
navy
and
the
pleece
and
parliament
and
the
king
agin
one
pore
silly
bloke
you
would
done
it
a
purpose
i
lay
much
said
oswald
in
gloomy
dejection
a
peppermint
extra
strong
when
the
pigman
had
had
one
he
went
on
talking
a
young
chap
now
he
said
out
of
dover
gaol
i
to
know
what
he
in
for
nicked
a
cake
he
did
off
of
a
counter
at
a
pastrycook
jenner
it
was
in
the
high
street
part
hunger
part
playfulness
but
even
if
i
was
to
know
what
he
was
lagged
for
do
you
think
i
put
the
coppers
on
to
him
not
me
give
a
fellow
a
chance
is
what
i
say
but
do
you
grizzle
about
them
there
tommies
it
be
the
making
of
in
the
end
a
pair
as
ever
wore
boots
seed
only
next
time
just
you
take
and
think
afore
you
pipes
up
see
we
said
that
we
saw
and
that
next
time
we
would
do
as
he
said
and
we
went
home
again
as
we
went
dora
said
supposing
it
was
a
cruel
murderer
that
had
got
loose
you
ought
to
tell
then
said
dicky
before
you
do
tell
you
ought
to
be
jolly
sure
it
a
cruel
murderer
and
not
a
chap
that
taken
a
cake
because
he
was
hungry
how
do
you
know
what
do
if
you
were
hungry
enough
should
steal
said
dora
not
so
sure
said
dicky
and
they
argued
about
it
all
the
way
home
and
before
we
got
in
it
began
to
rain
in
torrents
conversations
about
food
always
make
you
feel
as
though
it
was
a
very
long
time
since
you
had
had
anything
to
eat
beale
had
gone
home
of
course
but
we
went
into
the
larder
it
is
a
generous
larder
no
lock
only
a
big
wooden
latch
that
pulls
up
with
a
string
like
in
red
riding
hood
and
the
floor
is
clean
damp
red
brick
it
makes
soft
if
you
put
the
bag
on
this
floor
there
was
half
a
rhubarb
pie
and
there
were
meat
turnovers
with
potato
in
them
beale
is
a
thoughtful
person
and
i
know
many
people
much
richer
that
are
not
nearly
so
thoughtful
we
had
a
comfortable
feast
at
the
kitchen
table
standing
up
to
eat
like
horses
then
we
had
to
let
noël
read
us
his
piece
of
poetry
about
the
soldier
he
would
have
slept
if
we
had
it
was
very
long
and
it
began
as
i
have
said
and
ended
up
soldiers
learn
a
lesson
from
it
is
very
wrong
to
run
away
it
is
better
to
stay
and
serve
your
king
and
country
hurray
noël
owned
that
hooray
sounded
too
cheerful
for
the
end
of
a
poem
about
soldiers
with
faces
like
theirs
were
i
did
mean
it
about
the
soldiers
it
was
about
the
king
and
country
half
a
sec
i
put
that
in
so
he
wrote
i
do
not
mean
to
be
unkind
poor
soldiers
to
you
so
never
mind
when
i
say
hurray
or
sing
it
is
because
i
am
thinking
of
my
country
and
my
king
ca
sing
hooray
said
dicky
so
noël
went
to
bed
singing
it
which
was
better
than
arguing
about
it
alice
said
but
it
was
noisier
as
well
oswald
and
dicky
always
went
round
the
house
to
see
that
all
the
doors
were
bolted
and
the
shutters
up
this
is
what
the
head
of
the
house
always
does
and
oswald
is
the
head
when
father
is
not
there
there
are
no
shutters
upstairs
only
curtains
the
white
house
which
is
miss
sandal
house
name
is
not
in
the
village
but
a
step
from
it
as
beale
says
it
is
the
first
house
you
come
to
as
you
come
along
the
road
from
the
marsh
we
used
to
look
in
the
cupboard
and
under
the
beds
for
burglars
every
night
the
girls
liked
us
to
though
they
would
look
themselves
and
i
do
know
that
it
was
much
good
if
there
a
burglar
sometimes
safer
for
you
not
to
know
it
where
ignorance
is
bliss
is
folly
to
find
a
burglar
especially
as
he
would
be
armed
to
the
teeth
as
likely
as
not
however
there
is
not
much
worth
being
a
burglar
about
in
houses
where
the
motto
is
plain
living
and
high
thinking
and
there
never
was
anyone
in
the
cupboards
or
under
the
beds
then
we
put
out
all
the
lights
very
carefully
in
case
of
fire
all
except
noël
he
does
not
like
the
dark
he
says
there
are
things
in
it
that
go
away
when
you
light
a
candle
and
however
much
you
talk
reason
and
science
to
him
it
makes
no
difference
at
all
then
we
got
into
our
pyjamas
it
was
oswald
who
asked
father
to
let
us
have
pyjamas
instead
of
nightgowns
they
are
so
convenient
for
dressing
up
when
you
wish
to
act
clowns
or
west
indian
planters
or
any
characters
then
we
got
into
bed
and
then
we
got
into
sleep
little
did
the
unconscious
sleepers
reck
of
the
strange
destiny
that
was
advancing
on
them
by
leaps
and
bounds
through
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
although
we
were
asleep
the
rain
went
on
raining
just
the
same
and
the
wind
blowing
across
the
marsh
with
the
fury
of
a
maniac
who
has
been
transformed
into
a
blacksmith
bellows
and
through
the
night
and
the
wind
and
the
rain
our
dreadful
destiny
drew
nearer
and
nearer
i
wish
this
to
sound
as
if
something
was
going
to
happen
and
i
hope
it
does
i
hope
the
reader
heart
is
now
standing
still
with
apprehensionness
on
our
account
but
i
do
not
want
it
to
stop
altogether
so
i
will
tell
you
that
we
were
not
all
going
to
be
murdered
in
our
beds
or
pass
peacefully
away
in
our
sleeps
with
smiles
on
our
young
and
beautiful
faces
not
at
all
what
really
happened
was
this
some
time
must
have
elapsed
between
our
closing
our
eyes
in
serene
slumber
and
the
following
narrative
oswald
was
awakened
by
dicky
thumping
him
hard
in
the
back
and
saying
in
accents
of
terror
at
least
he
says
not
but
oswald
knows
what
they
sounded
like
that
oswald
reared
up
on
his
elbow
and
listened
but
there
was
nothing
to
listen
to
except
dicky
breathing
like
a
grampus
and
the
of
the
overflowing
from
the
tub
under
the
window
what
said
oswald
he
did
not
speak
furiously
as
many
elder
brothers
would
have
done
when
suddenly
awakened
by
thumps
said
dicky
it
is
again
and
this
time
certainly
there
it
was
and
it
sounded
like
somebody
hammering
on
the
with
his
fists
there
is
no
knocker
to
the
house
oswald
controlled
his
fears
if
he
had
any
i
am
not
going
to
say
whether
he
had
or
had
and
struck
a
match
before
the
candle
had
had
time
to
settle
its
flame
after
the
first
flare
up
that
does
last
the
row
began
again
oswald
nerves
are
of
iron
but
it
would
have
given
anybody
a
start
to
see
two
white
figures
in
the
doorway
yet
so
it
was
they
proved
to
be
alice
and
dora
in
their
nighties
but
no
one
could
blame
anyone
for
not
being
sure
of
this
at
first
it
burglars
said
dora
and
her
teeth
did
chatter
whatever
she
may
say
think
it
beale
said
alice
expect
she
forgotten
the
key
oswald
pulled
his
watch
out
from
under
his
pillow
one
he
said
and
then
the
knocking
began
again
so
the
intrepid
oswald
went
to
the
landing
window
that
is
over
the
the
others
went
too
and
he
opened
the
window
in
his
pyjamas
and
said
there
there
was
the
scraping
sound
of
boots
on
the
doorstep
as
somebody
down
there
stepped
back
this
the
way
to
ashford
said
the
voice
of
a
man
thirteen
miles
off
said
oswald
get
on
to
the
dover
road
do
want
to
get
on
the
dover
road
said
the
voice
had
enough
of
dover
a
thrill
ran
through
every
heart
we
all
told
each
other
so
afterwards
said
dicky
thirteen
miles
but
you
in
the
house
we
got
men
and
dogs
and
guns
whispered
dora
are
six
of
us
said
oswald
armed
to
the
teeth
the
stranger
laughed
not
a
burglar
he
said
lost
my
way
that
all
i
thought
i
should
have
got
to
ashford
before
dusk
but
i
missed
the
way
i
been
wandering
all
over
these
marshes
ever
since
in
the
rain
i
expect
they
out
after
me
now
but
i
dead
beat
i
ca
go
on
wo
you
let
me
in
i
can
sit
by
the
kitchen
fire
oswald
drew
his
head
back
through
the
window
and
a
hasty
council
took
place
on
the
landing
said
alice
heard
what
he
said
about
dover
and
their
being
out
after
him
say
you
might
let
a
chap
in
said
the
voice
outside
perfectly
respectable
upon
my
word
i
am
wish
he
had
said
that
whispered
dora
such
a
dreadful
story
and
we
did
even
ask
him
if
he
was
sounds
very
tired
said
alice
wet
said
oswald
heard
the
water
squelching
in
his
boots
happen
if
we
do
let
him
in
said
dicky
be
caught
and
taken
back
like
the
soldiers
said
oswald
here
i
going
to
chance
it
you
others
can
lock
yourselves
into
your
rooms
if
you
frightened
then
oswald
put
his
brave
young
head
out
of
the
window
and
the
rain
dripped
on
to
the
back
of
his
bold
young
neck
off
the
roof
like
a
on
to
a
beautiful
flower
and
he
said
a
porch
to
the
side
door
just
scoot
round
there
and
shelter
and
i
come
down
in
half
a
sec
a
resolve
made
in
early
youth
never
to
face
midnight
encounters
without
boots
was
the
cause
of
this
delay
oswald
and
dicky
got
into
their
boots
and
jackets
and
told
the
girls
to
go
back
to
bed
then
we
went
down
and
opened
the
the
stranger
had
heard
the
bolts
go
and
he
was
outside
waiting
we
held
the
door
open
politely
and
he
stepped
in
and
began
at
once
to
drip
heavily
on
the
doormat
we
shut
the
door
he
looked
wildly
round
calm
you
are
safe
said
oswald
said
the
stranger
see
i
am
all
our
hearts
were
full
of
pity
for
the
outcast
he
was
indeed
a
spectacle
to
shock
the
benevolent
even
the
prison
people
oswald
thought
or
the
man
he
took
the
cake
from
would
have
felt
their
fierceness
fade
if
they
could
have
seen
him
then
he
was
not
in
prison
dress
oswald
would
have
rather
liked
to
see
that
but
he
remembered
that
it
was
safer
for
the
man
that
he
had
found
means
to
rid
himself
of
the
felon
garb
he
wore
a
gray
knickerbocker
suit
covered
with
mud
the
lining
of
his
hat
must
have
been
blue
and
it
had
run
down
his
face
in
streaks
like
the
gentleman
in
kipling
story
he
was
wetter
than
i
have
ever
seen
anyone
out
of
a
bath
or
the
sea
into
the
kitchen
said
oswald
can
drip
there
quite
comfortably
the
floor
is
brick
he
followed
us
into
the
kitchen
you
kids
alone
in
the
house
he
said
said
oswald
i
suppose
it
no
good
asking
if
you
got
a
drop
of
brandy
a
bit
said
dicky
illustration
come
into
the
kitchen
said
oswald
you
can
drip
there
quite
comfortably
page
would
do
or
gin
any
sort
of
spirit
said
the
smeared
stranger
hopefully
a
drop
said
oswald
least
i
look
in
the
medicine
cupboard
and
i
say
take
off
your
things
and
put
them
in
the
sink
i
get
you
some
other
clothes
there
are
some
of
mr
sandal
the
man
hesitated
make
a
better
disguise
said
oswald
in
a
low
significant
whisper
and
turned
tactfully
away
so
as
not
to
make
the
stranger
feel
awkward
dicky
got
the
clothes
and
the
stranger
changed
in
the
the
only
spirit
oswald
could
find
was
spirits
of
salts
which
the
stranger
said
was
poison
and
spirits
of
camphor
oswald
gave
him
some
of
this
on
sugar
he
knows
it
is
a
good
thing
when
you
have
taken
cold
the
stranger
hated
it
he
changed
in
the
and
while
he
was
doing
it
we
tried
to
light
the
kitchen
fire
but
it
would
not
so
dicky
went
up
to
ask
alice
for
some
matches
and
finding
the
girls
had
not
gone
to
bed
as
ordered
but
contrarily
dressed
themselves
he
let
them
come
down
and
then
of
course
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
not
light
the
fire
they
did
when
the
unfortunate
one
came
out
of
the
he
looked
quite
a
decent
chap
though
still
blue
in
patches
from
the
lining
of
his
hat
dicky
whispered
to
me
what
a
difference
clothes
made
he
made
a
polite
though
jerky
bow
to
the
girls
and
dora
said
do
you
do
i
hope
you
are
quite
well
well
as
can
be
expected
replied
the
now
tidy
outcast
what
i
gone
through
or
cocoa
said
dora
do
you
like
cheese
or
cold
bacon
best
leave
it
to
you
entirely
he
answered
and
he
added
without
a
pause
sure
i
can
trust
you
you
can
said
dora
earnestly
need
be
a
bit
afraid
you
perfectly
safe
with
us
he
opened
his
eyes
at
this
did
expect
such
kindness
alice
whispered
man
he
quite
overcome
we
gave
him
cocoa
and
cheese
and
bacon
and
butter
and
bread
and
he
ate
a
great
deal
with
his
feet
in
sandal
boots
on
the
kitchen
fender
the
girls
wrung
the
water
out
of
his
clothes
and
hung
them
on
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
sure
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
he
said
charity
i
call
this
i
sha
forget
it
i
assure
you
i
ought
to
apologise
for
knocking
you
up
like
this
but
i
been
hours
tramping
through
this
precious
marsh
of
yours
wet
to
the
skin
and
not
a
morsel
of
food
since
and
yours
was
the
first
light
i
seen
for
a
couple
of
hours
very
glad
it
us
you
knocked
up
said
alice
am
i
said
he
might
have
knocked
at
a
great
many
doors
before
i
got
such
a
welcome
i
quite
aware
of
that
he
spoke
all
right
not
like
a
labouring
man
but
it
was
a
gentleman
voice
and
he
seemed
to
end
his
sentences
off
short
at
the
end
as
though
he
had
it
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
say
or
oswald
thought
how
terrible
it
must
be
to
be
out
alone
in
the
rain
and
the
dark
with
the
police
after
you
and
no
one
to
be
kind
to
you
if
you
knocked
at
their
doors
must
have
had
an
awful
day
he
said
believe
you
said
the
stranger
cutting
himself
more
bacon
you
miss
he
really
did
say
it
that
time
just
half
a
cup
if
you
mind
i
believe
you
i
never
want
to
have
such
a
day
again
i
can
tell
you
i
took
one
or
two
little
things
in
the
morning
but
i
was
in
the
mood
or
something
you
know
how
it
is
sometimes
can
fancy
it
said
alice
then
the
afternoon
clouded
over
it
cleared
up
at
sunset
you
remember
but
then
it
was
too
late
and
then
the
rain
came
on
not
half
my
word
i
been
in
a
ditch
thought
my
last
hour
had
come
i
tell
you
only
got
out
by
the
skin
of
my
teeth
got
rid
of
my
whole
outfit
there
a
nice
thing
to
happen
to
a
young
fellow
upon
my
sam
enough
to
make
a
chap
swear
he
never
take
another
thing
as
long
as
he
lives
hope
you
never
will
said
dora
earnestly
does
pay
you
know
my
word
that
nearly
true
though
i
do
know
how
know
said
the
stranger
beginning
on
the
cheese
and
pickles
wish
dora
was
beginning
but
oswald
interrupted
he
did
not
think
it
was
fair
to
preach
at
the
man
you
lost
your
outfit
in
the
ditch
he
said
how
did
you
get
those
clothes
he
pointed
to
the
steaming
gray
suit
replied
the
stranger
usual
way
oswald
was
too
polite
to
ask
what
was
the
usual
way
of
getting
a
gray
suit
to
replace
a
prison
outfit
he
was
afraid
the
usual
way
was
the
way
the
cake
had
been
got
alice
looked
at
me
helplessly
i
knew
just
how
she
felt
harbouring
a
criminal
when
people
are
after
him
gives
you
a
very
chilly
feeling
in
the
waistcoat
or
if
in
pyjamas
in
the
part
that
the
plaited
cotton
cord
goes
round
by
the
greatest
good
luck
there
were
a
few
of
the
peppermints
left
we
had
two
each
and
felt
better
the
girls
put
the
sheets
off
oswald
bed
on
to
the
bed
miss
sandal
used
to
sleep
in
when
not
in
london
nursing
the
shattered
bones
of
her
brother
you
will
go
to
bed
now
oswald
said
to
the
stranger
will
wake
you
in
good
time
and
you
may
sleep
as
sound
as
you
like
we
wake
you
all
right
might
wake
me
about
eight
he
said
ought
to
be
getting
on
i
sure
i
do
know
what
to
say
in
return
for
the
very
handsome
reception
you
given
me
to
you
all
i
sure
said
everyone
and
dora
added
you
bother
while
you
asleep
we
think
what
best
to
be
done
bother
said
the
stranger
and
he
absently
glanced
at
his
own
clothes
big
enough
to
get
out
of
big
enough
to
get
into
then
he
took
the
candle
and
dicky
showed
him
to
his
room
big
enough
to
get
out
of
repeated
alice
he
mean
to
creep
back
into
prison
and
pretend
he
was
there
all
the
time
only
they
did
notice
him
what
are
we
to
do
asked
dicky
rejoining
the
rest
of
us
told
me
the
dark
room
at
dover
was
a
disgrace
poor
chap
must
invent
a
disguise
said
dora
pretend
he
our
aunt
and
dress
him
up
like
in
hard
cash
said
alice
it
was
now
three
but
no
one
was
sleepy
no
one
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
at
all
till
we
had
taken
our
candles
up
into
the
attic
and
rummaged
through
miss
sandal
trunks
and
found
a
complete
disguise
exactly
suited
to
an
aunt
we
had
everything
dress
cloak
bonnet
veil
gloves
petticoats
and
even
boots
though
we
knew
all
the
time
in
our
hearts
that
these
were
far
too
small
we
put
all
ready
on
the
parlour
sofa
and
then
at
last
we
began
to
feel
in
our
eyes
and
ears
and
jaws
how
late
it
was
so
we
went
back
to
bed
alice
said
she
knew
how
to
wake
exact
to
the
minute
and
we
had
known
her
do
it
before
so
we
trusted
her
and
agreed
that
she
was
to
wake
us
at
six
but
alas
alice
had
deemed
herself
cleverer
than
she
was
by
long
chalks
and
it
was
not
her
that
woke
us
we
were
aroused
from
deep
slumber
by
the
voice
of
beale
it
remarked
up
young
gentlemen
it
gone
the
half
after
nine
and
your
gentleman
friend
up
and
dressed
and
for
his
breakfast
we
sprang
up
say
beale
cried
oswald
who
never
even
in
sleep
quite
loses
his
presence
of
mind
let
on
to
anyone
that
we
got
a
visitor
she
went
away
laughing
i
suppose
she
thought
it
was
some
silly
she
little
knew
we
found
the
stranger
looking
out
of
the
window
would
do
that
said
dora
softly
is
safe
suppose
someone
saw
you
said
he
they
did
might
take
you
you
know
said
dora
done
in
a
minute
we
saw
two
poor
men
taken
yesterday
her
voice
trembled
at
the
gloomy
recollection
take
me
said
the
man
who
wore
the
clothes
of
the
and
sandal
do
mind
so
long
as
my
ugly
mug
do
break
the
camera
want
to
save
you
dora
was
beginning
but
oswald
beyond
his
years
felt
a
hot
redness
spread
over
his
youthful
ears
and
right
down
his
neck
he
said
what
were
you
doing
in
dover
and
what
did
you
take
yesterday
was
in
dover
on
business
said
the
man
what
i
took
was
hythe
church
and
burmarsh
church
and
you
did
steal
a
cake
and
get
put
into
dover
gaol
and
break
loose
and
said
dicky
though
i
kicked
him
as
a
sign
not
to
said
our
friend
exactly
are
you
if
you
not
that
poor
escaped
thief
what
are
you
asked
dora
fiercely
before
oswald
could
stop
her
a
photographer
miss
said
he
travelling
photographer
then
slowly
but
surely
he
saw
it
all
and
i
thought
he
would
never
have
done
laughing
is
getting
cold
said
oswald
it
is
said
our
guest
what
a
go
this
be
something
to
talk
about
between
friends
for
many
a
year
said
alice
suddenly
thought
you
were
a
runaway
thief
and
we
wanted
to
help
you
whatever
you
were
she
pointed
to
the
sofa
where
the
whole
costume
of
the
untrue
aunt
was
lying
in
simple
completeness
you
in
honour
bound
never
to
tell
a
soul
think
she
added
in
persuading
tones
of
the
cold
bacon
and
the
cheese
and
all
those
pickles
you
had
and
the
fire
and
the
cocoa
and
us
being
up
all
night
and
the
dry
boots
no
more
miss
said
the
photographer
for
such
he
indeed
was
nobly
will
is
my
law
i
wo
never
breathe
a
word
and
he
sat
down
to
the
ham
and
eggs
as
though
it
was
weeks
since
he
had
tasted
bacon
but
we
found
out
afterwards
he
went
straight
up
to
the
ship
and
told
everybody
all
about
it
i
wonder
whether
all
photographers
are
dishonourable
and
ungrateful
oswald
hopes
they
are
not
but
he
can
not
feel
at
all
sure
lots
of
people
chaffed
us
about
it
afterwards
but
the
pigman
said
we
were
jolly
straight
young
britons
and
it
is
something
to
be
called
that
by
a
man
you
really
respect
it
does
matter
so
much
what
the
other
people
say
the
people
you
do
really
care
about
when
we
told
our
indian
uncle
about
it
he
said
you
ought
never
to
try
and
shield
a
criminal
but
that
was
not
at
all
the
way
we
felt
about
it
at
the
time
when
the
criminal
was
there
or
we
thought
he
was
all
wet
and
hunted
and
miserable
with
people
after
him
he
meant
his
friends
who
were
expecting
him
but
we
thought
he
meant
police
it
is
very
hard
sometimes
to
know
exactly
what
is
right
if
what
right
right
how
are
you
to
know
i
wonder
the
only
comforting
thing
about
it
all
is
that
we
heard
next
day
that
the
soldiers
had
got
away
from
the
brown
bicycle
beast
after
all
i
suppose
it
came
home
to
them
suddenly
that
they
two
to
one
and
they
shoved
him
into
a
ditch
and
got
away
they
were
never
caught
i
am
very
glad
and
i
suppose
wrong
too
so
many
things
are
but
i
the
arsenicators
a
tale
of
crime
it
was
beale
who
put
it
into
our
heads
that
miss
sandal
lived
plain
because
she
was
poor
we
knew
she
thought
high
because
that
is
what
you
jolly
well
have
to
do
if
you
are
a
vegetationist
and
an
and
those
sort
of
things
and
we
tried
to
get
money
for
her
like
we
had
once
tried
to
do
for
ourselves
and
we
succeeded
by
means
that
have
been
told
alone
in
another
place
in
getting
two
golden
pounds
then
of
course
we
began
to
wonder
what
we
had
better
do
with
the
two
pounds
now
we
had
got
them
them
in
the
dora
said
alice
said
when
we
could
have
them
to
look
at
noël
thought
we
ought
to
buy
her
something
beautiful
to
adorn
miss
sandal
bare
dwelling
thought
we
might
spend
it
on
nice
tinned
and
potted
things
from
the
stores
to
make
the
plain
living
and
high
thinking
go
down
better
but
oswald
knew
that
however
nice
the
presents
are
that
other
people
buy
for
you
it
is
really
more
satisfying
to
have
the
chink
to
spend
exactly
as
you
like
then
dicky
said
do
believe
in
letting
money
lie
idle
father
always
says
it
bad
business
give
interest
at
the
bank
do
they
dora
said
tuppence
a
year
or
some
rot
like
that
we
ought
to
go
into
trade
with
it
and
try
to
make
more
of
it
that
what
we
ought
to
do
it
miss
sandal
money
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
anything
with
it
without
asking
her
is
hers
till
she
got
it
and
it
is
hers
because
it
not
ours
to
spend
i
think
we
what
is
it
loco
to
that
two
quid
because
anyone
can
see
poor
miss
sandal
does
know
how
to
manage
her
money
and
it
will
be
much
better
if
we
give
her
ten
pounds
than
just
two
this
is
how
dicky
argued
we
were
sitting
on
the
sands
when
this
council
took
place
and
alice
said
we
bought
a
and
sold
shrimps
from
our
window
in
red
handkerchiefs
and
white
french
caps
but
we
asked
her
how
she
would
like
going
into
the
sea
nearly
up
to
her
neck
in
all
weathers
and
she
had
to
own
she
had
not
thought
of
that
besides
shrimps
are
so
beastly
cheap
more
than
you
can
eat
for
twopence
the
conversation
was
not
interesting
to
anyone
but
dicky
because
we
did
not
then
believe
we
could
do
it
though
later
we
thought
differently
but
i
dare
say
we
should
have
gone
on
with
it
just
out
of
politeness
to
him
only
at
this
moment
we
saw
a
coastguard
who
is
a
great
friend
of
ours
waving
to
us
from
the
so
we
went
up
and
he
said
take
my
tip
and
cut
along
home
there
something
come
for
you
it
heaps
of
things
like
i
said
to
eat
with
the
plain
living
said
o
and
bright
visions
of
hampers
full
of
the
most
superior
tuck
winged
our
young
legs
as
we
cut
along
home
it
was
not
however
a
hamper
that
we
found
awaiting
us
it
was
a
large
box
and
besides
that
there
were
two
cases
addressed
to
dicky
and
me
and
through
the
gaps
in
the
boards
we
could
see
twisted
straw
and
our
hearts
leapt
high
in
our
breasts
because
we
knew
that
they
were
bikes
and
such
indeed
they
proved
to
be
of
the
most
unspotted
character
the
noble
gift
of
our
indian
uncle
ever
amiable
generous
and
esteemed
while
we
were
getting
the
glorious
bikes
from
their
prison
bars
the
others
were
undoing
the
box
which
had
their
names
on
it
it
contained
cakes
and
sweets
a
for
dora
lined
with
red
satin
and
dressed
up
with
silver
thimbles
and
all
sorts
of
bodkins
and
scissors
and
knives
with
silver
handles
there
was
a
lovely
box
of
paints
for
alice
noël
had
a
too
and
had
a
very
good
aunt
sally
and
there
were
lots
of
books
not
the
sawdusty
dry
kind
that
miss
sandal
had
in
her
house
but
jolly
good
books
the
kind
you
ca
put
down
till
you
finished
but
just
now
we
hardly
looked
at
them
for
who
with
a
spark
of
manly
spirit
would
think
twice
about
a
book
with
a
new
champing
the
oil
like
a
charger
in
a
ballad
dicky
and
i
had
a
spin
before
dinner
and
only
fell
off
five
times
between
us
three
spills
were
dicky
one
was
oswald
and
one
was
when
we
ran
into
each
other
the
bikes
were
totally
uninjured
as
time
ran
its
appointed
course
we
got
a
bit
used
to
the
bikes
and
finding
that
you
can
not
ride
all
day
and
all
night
we
began
to
look
at
the
books
only
one
of
them
comes
into
this
story
it
was
called
youth
manual
of
scientific
and
mechanical
recreation
and
of
course
we
none
of
us
read
it
till
we
read
everything
else
and
then
we
found
it
was
half
bad
it
taught
you
how
to
make
all
sorts
of
things
galvanic
batteries
and
kites
and
and
how
to
electroplate
things
and
how
to
do
and
we
tried
as
many
of
the
things
as
we
had
money
for
and
some
of
them
succeeded
then
we
made
a
it
took
a
long
time
to
make
and
then
it
caught
fire
and
blazed
away
before
we
could
get
it
launched
so
we
made
another
and
noël
dropped
it
near
the
where
there
was
a
puddle
and
being
it
was
unable
to
stand
the
strain
so
we
made
another
but
the
paste
was
bad
and
it
did
not
stick
so
we
made
another
then
at
last
when
all
was
ready
oswald
climbed
on
to
the
pigsty
at
beales
and
held
the
balloon
very
steady
while
dicky
lighted
the
soaked
in
spirits
of
wine
which
hangs
from
the
end
where
cars
are
in
larger
sizes
and
causes
it
to
be
called
a
a
taper
is
burned
inside
the
balloon
and
then
according
to
the
book
readily
ascends
and
is
carried
away
by
the
wind
sometimes
to
a
considerable
distance
well
this
time
everything
happened
just
as
the
book
said
which
is
not
always
the
case
it
was
a
clear
dark
night
bright
stars
only
and
to
our
relief
and
agreeable
surprise
our
balloon
rose
up
and
sailed
away
dragging
its
lighted
tail
like
a
comet
it
sailed
away
over
the
marshes
getting
smaller
and
smaller
and
at
last
it
was
though
lost
to
sight
to
memory
dear
some
of
us
thought
it
was
worth
doing
but
oswald
was
glad
he
had
persevered
he
does
hate
to
be
beaten
however
we
none
of
us
cared
to
make
another
so
we
went
to
bed
dicky
always
goes
to
sleep
directly
on
these
occasions
but
oswald
more
thoughtful
for
his
years
sometimes
reviews
the
events
of
the
day
he
must
have
been
nearly
asleep
because
he
was
just
reviewing
an
elephant
that
flew
with
a
lamp
inside
so
that
it
looked
like
a
when
alice
suddenly
came
and
woke
him
up
completely
she
said
in
tones
of
awe
and
he
said
but
not
crossly
what
on
earth
up
now
replied
alice
about
it
he
rejoined
still
calm
and
kind
though
roused
from
his
reviews
it
came
to
me
all
in
a
minute
oh
oswald
when
it
comes
down
there
are
lots
of
farms
in
the
march
suppose
it
comes
down
and
sets
light
to
something
it
a
crime
arsenic
or
something
and
you
can
be
hanged
for
it
be
an
idiot
said
oswald
kindly
book
would
have
told
youths
how
to
make
them
if
they
were
crimes
go
back
to
bed
for
goodness
sake
wish
we
had
oh
i
do
said
alice
but
she
did
as
she
was
told
oswald
has
taught
her
this
next
day
her
fears
had
stopped
like
silent
watches
in
the
night
and
we
began
to
make
a
trap
for
badgers
in
case
we
ever
found
one
but
dicky
went
to
the
top
of
the
mill
with
some
he
had
borrowed
from
carrington
to
look
at
distant
ships
with
and
he
burst
into
the
busy
circle
of
makers
and
said
say
come
and
look
there
a
fire
in
the
marsh
said
alice
dropping
the
wire
pliers
on
her
good
elder
brother
foot
did
i
tell
you
we
all
tore
to
the
top
of
the
mill
and
sure
enough
far
across
the
sunny
green
marshes
rose
a
little
cloud
of
smoke
and
blue
and
yellow
flames
leaped
out
every
now
and
then
we
all
took
turns
to
look
through
the
glasses
then
oswald
said
is
no
time
for
looking
through
with
your
mouths
open
we
must
go
and
help
we
might
fetch
the
or
something
the
bikes
dicky
almost
instantly
we
were
in
the
saddle
and
tearing
along
the
level
marsh
towards
the
direction
of
the
fire
at
first
we
got
down
at
every
crossroad
and
used
the
to
see
which
way
to
go
but
as
we
got
nearer
or
the
fire
got
bigger
or
perhaps
both
we
could
see
it
quite
plainly
with
the
naked
eye
it
was
much
further
off
than
we
had
thought
but
we
rode
on
undaunted
regardless
of
fatigue
and
of
being
now
long
gone
by
we
got
to
the
fire
at
last
it
was
at
crown
ovender
farm
and
we
had
to
lift
the
bikes
over
fences
and
wheel
them
over
ploughed
fields
to
get
there
because
we
did
not
know
the
right
way
by
road
crown
ovender
is
a
little
farmhouse
and
a
barn
opposite
and
a
great
and
two
of
the
ricks
were
alight
they
smoked
horribly
and
the
wind
blew
the
hot
smoke
into
your
eyes
and
every
now
and
then
you
saw
great
flames
yards
long
they
seemed
leap
out
as
if
they
were
crying
to
get
to
the
house
we
had
put
our
bikes
in
a
ditch
a
field
away
and
now
we
went
all
round
about
to
ask
if
we
could
help
but
there
was
a
soul
to
be
seen
we
did
not
know
what
to
do
even
oswald
always
full
of
resource
almost
scratched
his
head
which
seems
to
help
some
people
to
think
though
i
do
think
it
ever
would
me
besides
not
looking
nice
wish
we
told
them
in
the
village
said
dicky
we
had
not
done
this
and
the
reason
the
author
is
ashamed
to
say
was
because
we
wanted
to
get
there
before
anyone
else
this
was
very
selfish
and
the
author
has
often
regretted
it
the
flames
were
growing
larger
and
fiercer
and
the
tar
on
the
side
of
the
barn
next
the
was
melting
and
running
down
like
treacle
a
well
said
dicky
suddenly
is
a
deep
well
and
there
are
two
buckets
oswald
understood
he
drew
up
the
water
and
dicky
took
the
buckets
as
they
came
up
full
and
dripping
and
dashed
the
water
on
to
the
tarry
face
of
the
barn
it
hissed
and
steamed
we
think
it
did
some
good
we
took
it
in
turns
to
turn
the
it
was
hard
work
and
it
was
frightfully
hot
then
suddenly
we
heard
a
horrid
sound
a
sort
of
scream
and
there
was
a
woman
very
red
in
the
face
and
perspiring
climbing
over
the
fence
said
oswald
the
woman
said
panting
not
the
house
then
thank
them
as
be
it
not
the
house
oh
my
heart
alive
i
thought
it
was
the
house
is
the
house
said
oswald
it
jolly
soon
will
be
my
pore
lily
said
the
woman
this
wind
the
house
be
alight
in
a
minute
and
her
in
there
where
honeysett
no
one
here
but
us
the
house
is
locked
up
we
said
i
know
of
tramps
honeysett
got
the
key
i
comes
in
as
soon
as
i
cleared
dinner
away
she
ill
sleeping
like
a
lamb
i
be
bound
all
unknowing
of
her
burning
end
get
her
out
said
oswald
but
the
woman
did
seem
to
know
what
to
do
she
kept
on
saying
honeysett
oh
drat
him
where
that
honeysett
so
then
oswald
felt
it
was
the
time
to
be
a
general
like
he
always
meant
to
if
he
got
the
chance
he
said
on
and
he
took
a
stone
and
broke
the
kitchen
window
and
put
his
hand
through
the
jagged
hole
and
unfastened
the
catch
and
climbed
in
the
was
locked
and
the
key
gone
but
the
was
only
bolted
inside
but
it
stuck
very
tight
from
having
been
painted
and
shut
before
the
paint
was
dry
and
never
opened
again
oswald
could
open
it
he
ran
back
to
the
kitchen
window
and
shouted
to
the
others
round
to
the
other
door
and
shove
for
all
you
worth
he
cried
in
the
manly
tones
that
all
must
obey
so
they
went
but
dicky
told
me
afterwards
that
the
woman
did
shove
for
anything
like
all
she
was
worth
in
fact
she
would
shove
at
all
till
he
had
to
make
a
sort
of
of
her
and
then
she
seemed
to
awake
from
a
dream
and
they
got
the
door
open
we
followed
the
woman
up
the
stairs
and
into
a
bedroom
and
there
was
another
woman
sitting
up
in
bed
trembling
and
her
mouth
opening
and
shutting
it
you
eliza
she
said
falling
back
against
the
pillows
thought
it
were
tramps
eliza
did
not
break
things
to
the
sufferer
gently
like
we
should
have
done
however
hurried
you
are
burnt
alive
in
your
bed
lily
she
merely
remarked
place
is
all
ablaze
then
she
rolled
her
sick
sufferer
in
a
blanket
and
took
hold
of
her
shoulders
and
told
us
to
take
her
feet
but
oswald
was
too
calm
to
do
this
suddenly
he
said
are
you
going
to
put
her
said
eliza
wildly
is
better
than
this
here
plenty
of
time
said
oswald
and
he
and
dicky
rushed
into
another
room
and
got
a
and
bedclothes
and
hunched
them
down
the
stairs
and
dragged
them
half
a
field
away
and
made
a
bed
in
a
nice
dry
ditch
and
then
we
consented
to
carry
the
unfortunate
to
it
the
house
was
full
of
smoke
by
this
time
though
it
had
yet
caught
fire
and
i
tell
you
we
felt
just
like
heroic
firemen
as
we
stumbled
down
the
crookety
narrow
stairs
back
first
bearing
the
feet
of
the
sick
woman
oswald
did
so
wish
he
had
had
a
fireman
helmet
to
put
on
when
we
got
the
fading
lily
to
her
dry
ditch
she
clutched
oswald
arm
and
whispered
the
sticks
sticks
asked
oswald
who
thought
it
was
the
ragings
of
delirium
means
the
furniture
said
eliza
i
afraid
its
doom
is
written
on
high
illustration
consented
to
carry
the
unfortunate
to
it
page
said
oswald
kindly
and
we
flew
back
us
boys
dragging
eliza
with
us
there
did
seem
to
be
much
furniture
in
the
house
but
when
we
began
to
move
it
it
at
once
seemed
to
multiply
itself
with
the
rapidity
of
compound
interest
we
got
all
the
clothes
out
first
in
drawers
and
and
tied
up
in
sheets
eliza
was
much
use
the
only
thing
she
could
do
was
to
look
for
a
to
unscrew
the
iron
bedsteads
but
oswald
and
dicky
toiled
on
they
carried
out
chairs
and
tables
and
hearthrugs
as
oswald
was
staggering
on
under
a
windsor
armchair
with
a
and
an
under
his
arms
he
ran
into
a
man
up
said
he
said
oswald
seed
that
said
the
man
oswald
shoved
the
chair
and
other
things
on
to
the
man
lend
a
hand
to
get
the
things
away
he
said
and
more
and
more
people
came
and
all
worked
hard
but
oswald
and
dicky
did
most
eliza
never
even
found
that
because
when
she
saw
people
beginning
to
come
thicker
and
thicker
across
the
fields
like
ants
hurrying
home
she
went
out
and
told
everyone
over
and
over
again
that
honeysett
had
got
the
key
then
a
woman
came
along
and
eliza
got
her
into
a
corner
by
the
stairs
and
jawed
i
heard
part
of
the
jaw
pore
simpkins
her
man
he
gone
to
ashford
market
with
his
beasts
and
the
three
other
men
and
me
and
my
man
said
we
have
liz
up
at
my
place
her
being
my
sister
so
as
honeysett
could
go
off
to
romney
about
the
sheep
but
she
would
come
not
though
we
brought
the
light
cart
over
for
her
so
we
thought
it
best
honeysett
stayed
about
his
work
and
go
for
the
sheep
the
house
would
ha
been
all
empty
but
for
her
not
being
wishful
to
go
along
of
you
oswald
heard
the
other
say
said
eliza
so
you
see
keep
your
mouth
shut
the
other
woman
fiercely
said
lily
sister
but
tom
he
my
brother
if
you
do
shut
your
silly
mouth
you
be
getting
of
them
into
trouble
it
insured
ai
it
do
see
said
eliza
do
never
see
nothing
said
the
other
just
do
say
a
word
you
arst
and
then
only
as
you
come
to
look
after
her
and
found
the
fire
something
crool
why
the
other
woman
clawed
hold
of
her
and
dragged
her
away
whispering
secretly
all
this
time
the
fire
was
raging
but
there
were
lots
of
men
now
to
work
the
well
and
the
buckets
and
the
house
and
the
barn
had
not
caught
when
we
had
got
out
all
the
furniture
some
of
the
men
set
to
work
on
the
barn
and
of
course
oswald
and
dicky
though
weary
were
in
this
also
they
helped
to
get
out
all
the
wool
bundles
and
bundles
and
bundles
of
it
but
when
it
came
to
sacks
of
turnip
seed
and
things
they
thought
they
had
had
enough
and
they
went
to
where
the
things
were
that
had
come
out
of
the
larder
and
they
got
a
jug
of
milk
and
some
bread
and
cheese
and
took
it
to
the
woman
who
was
lying
in
the
dry
ditch
on
the
nice
bed
they
had
so
kindly
made
for
her
she
drank
some
milk
and
asked
them
to
have
some
and
they
did
with
bread
and
cheese
dutch
and
jolly
glad
they
were
of
it
just
as
we
had
finished
we
heard
a
shout
and
there
was
the
coming
across
the
field
i
do
like
they
are
so
smart
and
fierce
and
look
like
dragons
ready
to
fight
the
devouring
element
it
was
no
use
however
in
spite
of
the
beautiful
costumes
of
the
firemen
because
there
was
no
water
except
in
the
well
and
not
much
left
of
that
the
man
named
honeysett
had
ridden
off
on
an
old
boneshaker
of
his
to
fetch
the
engines
he
had
left
the
key
in
the
place
where
it
was
always
kept
only
eliza
had
not
had
the
sense
to
look
for
it
he
had
left
a
letter
for
her
too
written
in
red
pencil
on
the
back
of
a
bill
for
a
it
said
on
fir
going
to
git
oswald
treasures
this
letter
still
as
a
memento
of
happier
days
when
honeysett
saw
the
line
of
men
handing
up
buckets
to
throw
on
the
tarry
wall
he
said
ai
no
manner
of
use
wind
changed
a
hour
agone
and
so
it
had
the
flames
were
now
reaching
out
the
other
way
and
two
more
ricks
were
on
fire
but
the
tarry
walls
were
quite
cool
and
very
wet
and
the
men
who
were
throwing
the
water
were
very
surprised
to
find
that
they
were
standing
in
a
great
puddle
and
now
when
everything
in
the
house
and
the
barn
was
safe
oswald
had
time
to
draw
his
breath
and
think
and
to
remember
with
despair
exactly
who
it
was
that
had
launched
a
devastating
over
the
peaceful
marsh
it
was
getting
dusk
by
this
time
but
even
the
splendour
of
all
those
burning
ricks
against
the
darkening
sky
was
merely
wormwood
and
gall
to
oswald
upright
heart
and
he
jolly
soon
saw
that
it
was
the
same
to
dicky
feel
pretty
sick
he
said
go
home
say
the
whole
eleven
ricks
are
bound
to
go
said
dicky
the
wind
the
way
it
is
bound
to
go
said
oswald
inquired
the
less
thoughtful
dicky
prison
said
his
brother
turning
away
and
beginning
to
walk
towards
the
bicycles
ca
be
sure
it
was
our
balloon
said
dicky
following
average
said
oswald
bitterly
no
one
would
know
it
was
us
if
we
held
our
tongues
ca
hold
our
tongues
oswald
said
we
do
someone
else
will
be
blamed
as
sure
as
fate
you
did
hear
what
that
woman
said
about
insurance
money
might
wait
and
see
if
anyone
get
into
trouble
and
come
forward
said
dicky
and
oswald
owned
they
might
do
that
but
his
heart
was
full
of
despair
and
remorse
just
as
they
got
to
their
bikes
a
man
met
them
lost
i
suppose
he
said
jerking
his
thumb
at
the
blazing
farmyard
all
said
dicky
saved
the
furniture
and
the
wool
and
things
the
man
looked
at
us
and
said
heavily
kind
of
you
but
it
was
all
insured
here
said
oswald
earnestly
you
say
that
to
anyone
else
said
the
man
you
do
they
safe
to
think
you
set
fire
to
it
yourself
he
stared
then
he
frowned
then
he
laughed
and
said
something
about
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
and
went
on
we
went
on
too
in
interior
gloom
that
only
grew
gloomier
as
we
got
nearer
and
nearer
home
we
held
a
council
that
night
after
the
little
ones
had
gone
to
bed
dora
and
alice
seemed
to
have
been
crying
most
of
the
day
they
felt
a
little
better
when
they
heard
that
no
one
had
been
burned
to
death
alice
told
me
she
had
been
thinking
all
day
of
large
families
burned
to
little
cinders
but
about
telling
of
the
we
could
not
agree
alice
and
oswald
thought
we
ought
but
dicky
said
and
dora
said
to
father
about
it
alice
said
it
does
make
any
difference
about
our
not
being
sure
whether
our
balloon
the
cause
of
destruction
i
it
was
and
anyway
we
ought
to
own
up
feel
so
too
said
oswald
i
do
wish
i
knew
how
long
in
prison
you
got
for
it
we
went
to
bed
without
deciding
anything
and
very
early
in
the
morning
oswald
woke
and
he
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
there
was
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
still
going
up
from
the
doomed
rickyard
so
then
he
went
and
woke
alice
and
said
the
police
have
got
that
poor
farmer
locked
up
in
a
noisome
cell
and
all
the
time
it
just
what
feel
said
alice
then
oswald
said
dressed
and
when
she
had
she
came
out
into
the
road
where
oswald
pale
but
resolute
was
already
pacing
with
firm
steps
and
he
said
here
let
go
and
tell
let
say
you
and
i
made
the
balloon
the
others
can
stop
out
of
it
if
they
like
wo
if
it
really
prison
said
alice
it
would
be
noble
of
us
to
try
it
on
let
but
we
found
we
did
know
who
to
tell
seems
so
fatal
to
tell
the
police
said
alice
no
getting
out
of
it
afterwards
besides
he
only
jameson
and
he
very
stupid
the
author
assures
you
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
like
to
have
a
crime
like
arsenic
on
your
conscience
and
to
have
gone
to
the
trouble
and
expense
of
making
up
your
mind
to
confess
it
and
then
not
to
know
who
to
we
passed
a
wretched
day
and
all
the
time
the
ricks
were
blazing
all
the
people
in
the
village
went
over
with
carts
and
bikes
to
see
the
fire
like
going
to
a
fair
or
a
show
in
other
circumstances
we
should
have
done
the
same
but
now
we
had
no
heart
for
it
in
the
evening
oswald
went
for
a
walk
by
himself
and
he
found
his
footsteps
turning
towards
the
humble
dwelling
of
the
ancient
mariner
who
had
helped
us
in
a
smuggling
adventure
once
the
author
wishes
to
speak
the
truth
so
he
owns
that
perhaps
oswald
had
some
idea
that
the
ancient
mariner
who
knew
so
much
about
smugglers
and
highwaymen
might
be
able
to
think
of
some
way
for
us
to
save
ourselves
from
prison
without
getting
an
innocent
person
put
into
it
oswald
found
the
mariner
smoking
a
black
pipe
by
his
cottage
door
he
winked
at
oswald
as
usual
then
oswald
said
want
to
ask
your
advice
but
it
a
secret
i
know
you
can
keep
secrets
when
the
aged
one
had
agreed
to
this
oswald
told
him
all
it
was
a
great
relief
the
mariner
listened
with
deep
attention
and
when
oswald
had
quite
done
he
said
ai
the
stone
jug
this
time
mate
that
there
balloon
of
yours
i
see
it
go
up
fine
and
purty
was
too
all
saw
it
go
said
oswald
in
despairing
accents
question
is
where
did
it
come
down
burmarsh
sonny
was
the
unexpected
and
unspeakably
relieving
reply
sister
husband
niece
it
come
down
and
lodged
in
their
showed
it
me
this
morning
with
the
red
ink
on
it
what
spelled
your
names
out
oswald
only
pausing
to
wring
the
hand
of
his
preserver
tore
home
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
to
tell
the
others
i
do
think
we
were
ever
so
glad
of
anything
in
our
lives
it
is
a
frightfully
blighting
thing
when
you
believe
yourself
to
be
an
arsenicator
or
whatever
it
is
of
the
deepest
dye
as
soon
as
we
could
think
of
anything
but
our
own
cleanness
from
guilt
we
began
to
fear
the
worst
of
tom
simkins
the
farmer
at
crown
ovenden
but
came
out
of
it
like
us
without
a
stain
on
his
fair
name
because
he
and
his
sister
and
his
man
honeysett
all
swore
that
he
had
given
a
tramp
leave
to
sleep
up
against
the
beanstack
the
night
before
the
fire
and
the
tramp
pipe
and
matches
were
found
there
so
he
got
his
insurance
money
but
the
tramp
escaped
but
when
we
told
father
all
about
it
he
said
he
wished
he
had
been
a
director
of
that
fire
insurance
company
we
never
made
another
though
it
was
not
us
that
time
it
might
have
been
and
we
know
now
but
too
well
the
anxieties
of
a
life
of
crime
the
enchanceried
house
a
story
about
the
bastables
the
adventure
which
i
am
about
to
relate
was
a
very
long
time
ago
and
it
was
nobody
fault
the
part
of
it
that
was
most
like
a
real
crime
was
caused
by
not
being
at
that
date
old
enough
to
know
better
and
this
was
nobody
fault
though
we
took
care
that
but
a
brief
elapsed
between
the
discovery
of
his
acts
and
his
old
enough
to
know
better
and
knowing
it
too
better
i
mean
quite
thoroughly
we
were
residing
at
the
residence
of
an
old
nurse
of
father
while
dora
was
engaged
in
the
unagreeable
pastime
of
having
something
catching
at
home
if
she
had
been
with
us
most
likely
none
of
this
would
have
happened
for
she
has
an
almost
unerring
nose
for
right
and
wrong
or
perhaps
what
the
author
means
is
that
she
never
does
the
kind
of
thing
that
do
like
your
doing
father
old
nurse
was
very
jolly
to
us
and
did
not
bother
too
much
except
about
wet
feet
and
being
late
for
meals
and
not
airing
your
shirt
before
you
put
it
on
but
it
is
part
of
the
nature
of
the
nicest
to
bother
about
these
little
things
and
we
must
not
be
hard
on
them
for
it
for
no
one
can
help
their
natures
the
part
where
old
nurse
house
was
was
where
london
begins
to
leave
off
being
london
but
before
it
can
make
up
its
mind
not
to
be
it
there
are
fields
and
bits
of
lanes
and
hedges
but
the
rows
of
ugly
little
houses
go
creeping
along
like
yellow
caterpillars
eating
up
the
green
fields
there
are
brickfields
here
and
there
and
cabbage
fields
and
places
where
rhubarb
is
grown
and
it
is
much
more
interesting
than
real
town
because
there
is
more
room
to
do
things
in
and
not
so
many
people
to
say
when
you
do
nurse
house
was
the
kind
that
is
always
a
house
no
matter
how
much
you
pretend
it
is
a
baron
castle
or
an
enchanted
palace
and
to
play
at
its
being
a
robber
cave
or
any
part
of
a
pirate
ship
is
simply
silly
and
no
satisfaction
to
anyone
there
were
no
books
except
sermons
and
the
wesleyan
magazine
and
there
was
a
green
fuzziness
on
the
frame
of
the
in
the
parlour
there
was
a
garden
at
least
there
was
enough
ground
for
one
but
nothing
grew
there
except
nettles
and
and
one
and
a
poor
old
that
had
seen
better
days
there
was
a
hole
in
the
fence
very
convenient
for
going
through
in
a
hurry
one
morning
there
had
been
what
old
nurse
called
a
out
because
noël
was
writing
some
of
his
poetry
and
he
had
got
as
far
as
beautiful
the
sun
and
moon
and
all
the
stars
appear
they
really
are
a
long
way
off
although
they
look
very
near
do
not
think
that
they
are
worlds
but
apples
on
a
tree
the
angels
pick
them
whenever
they
like
but
it
is
not
so
with
me
i
wish
i
was
a
little
to
gather
stars
for
my
tea
before
dicky
found
out
that
he
was
writing
it
on
the
blank
leaf
at
the
end
of
the
latin
prize
dicky
got
at
the
preparatory
school
noël
for
mysterious
reasons
unknown
to
fame
is
alice
favourite
brother
and
of
course
she
stood
up
for
him
and
said
he
did
mean
it
and
things
were
said
on
both
sides
and
the
rest
of
us
agreed
with
dicky
that
noël
was
old
enough
to
know
better
it
ended
in
alice
and
noël
going
out
for
a
walk
by
themselves
as
soon
as
noël
had
had
the
crying
washed
off
his
hands
and
face
the
rest
of
us
spent
the
shining
hours
in
getting
a
board
and
nailing
it
up
in
the
for
a
station
in
case
of
saracens
arriving
with
an
army
to
attack
london
the
oak
is
always
hard
to
climb
and
this
was
a
peculiarly
hard
day
because
the
people
had
tied
a
to
the
oak
and
hung
their
wet
washing
out
on
the
line
the
sun
was
setting
in
the
west
as
usual
before
alice
and
noël
returned
they
came
across
the
wide
fields
from
the
direction
of
a
pinewood
that
we
had
never
explored
yet
though
always
meaning
to
said
dicky
been
and
gone
to
the
pinewood
all
by
themselves
but
the
hatchet
dicky
was
still
cherishing
in
his
breast
was
buried
at
once
under
the
first
words
spoken
by
the
returning
party
of
explorers
oswald
said
alice
dicky
we
found
a
treasure
dicky
hammered
the
last
nail
into
the
saracen
a
real
money
one
he
said
dropping
the
hammer
which
was
a
careless
thing
to
do
and
the
author
told
him
so
at
the
time
not
a
money
one
but
it
real
all
the
same
let
have
a
council
and
i
tell
you
it
was
then
that
dicky
showed
that
if
he
dropped
hammers
it
was
not
because
he
could
not
bury
hatchets
he
said
there
room
for
us
all
up
here
catch
hold
noël
oswald
give
him
a
shove
up
alice
and
he
can
sit
in
the
saracens
and
i
keep
hold
of
if
you
hand
him
up
alice
was
full
of
the
politest
compliments
about
the
architecture
of
the
saracens
and
noël
said
say
dicky
i
awfully
sorry
about
your
prize
all
right
said
dicky
rubbed
it
out
with
bread
noël
opened
his
mouth
he
looks
like
a
very
young
bird
when
he
does
this
my
beautiful
poem
turned
into
dirty
he
said
slowly
mind
said
alice
remember
nearly
every
word
of
it
write
it
out
again
after
tea
thought
you
be
so
pleased
noël
went
on
it
makes
a
book
more
valuable
to
have
an
author
writing
in
it
albert
uncle
told
me
so
it
has
to
be
the
same
author
that
wrote
the
book
alice
explained
it
was
cæsar
wrote
that
book
and
you
are
cæsar
you
know
do
want
to
be
said
noël
oswald
now
thought
that
politeness
was
satisfied
on
both
sides
so
he
said
price
treasures
and
then
alice
told
but
it
had
to
be
in
whispers
because
the
people
who
always
did
things
at
times
when
not
convenient
to
us
were
now
taking
in
their
washing
off
the
line
i
heard
them
remark
that
it
was
a
drying
day
alice
mysteriously
observed
was
like
this
do
you
think
the
saracens
is
really
safe
for
two
it
seems
to
go
down
awfully
much
in
the
middle
nearer
the
ends
then
said
oswald
thought
we
would
go
to
the
pinewoods
because
of
reading
in
bret
harte
that
the
resinous
balsam
of
the
pine
is
healing
to
the
wounded
spirit
should
have
thought
if
anybody
spirit
was
wounded
said
dicky
in
tones
of
heatening
indignantness
i
know
but
you
got
the
oak
and
i
expect
oaks
are
just
as
good
if
not
better
especially
for
english
people
because
of
oakapple
day
and
where
was
i
we
told
her
we
went
and
it
is
a
very
nice
wood
quite
tulgy
you
know
we
expected
to
see
a
bandersnatch
every
minute
did
we
noël
it
not
very
big
though
and
on
the
other
side
there
an
enchanted
desert
rather
bare
with
patches
of
grass
and
brambles
and
in
the
very
middle
of
it
we
found
the
treasure
have
a
squint
at
the
treasure
said
dicky
you
fetch
it
along
noël
and
alice
sniggered
exactly
said
alice
treasure
is
a
an
enchanted
house
said
noël
it
a
deserted
house
and
the
garden
is
like
in
the
sensitive
plant
after
the
lady
has
given
up
attending
you
go
in
we
asked
said
alice
came
back
for
you
and
we
asked
an
old
man
and
he
say
it
was
in
chancery
so
no
one
can
live
in
it
asked
what
was
enchancery
certain
the
old
man
meant
enchanted
said
noël
i
expect
that
the
word
for
it
enchanceried
is
a
very
nice
word
and
it
means
it
an
enchanted
house
just
like
i
said
nurse
now
came
out
to
remark
my
dears
so
we
left
the
tower
and
went
in
to
that
meal
noël
began
to
make
a
poem
called
enchanceried
house
but
we
got
him
to
stop
till
there
was
more
for
him
to
write
about
there
soon
was
more
and
more
than
enough
as
it
turned
out
the
setting
sun
had
set
but
it
had
left
a
redness
in
the
sky
like
one
of
those
distant
fires
that
you
go
after
and
they
are
always
miles
from
where
you
are
which
shone
through
the
pinetrees
the
house
looked
black
and
mysterious
against
the
horizon
it
was
a
house
the
windows
were
boarded
up
it
had
a
garden
and
a
paved
yard
and
outhouses
the
garden
had
a
high
wall
with
glass
on
top
but
oswald
and
dicky
got
into
the
yard
green
grass
was
growing
between
the
the
corners
of
the
stable
and
doors
were
rough
as
if
from
the
attacks
of
rats
but
we
never
saw
any
of
these
stealthy
rodents
the
was
locked
but
we
climbed
up
on
the
and
looked
through
a
little
window
and
saw
a
and
a
sink
with
taps
and
a
copper
and
a
broken
it
was
very
exciting
the
day
after
we
went
again
and
this
time
we
borrowed
the
people
and
by
tying
it
in
loops
made
a
sort
of
and
then
all
of
us
got
over
we
had
a
glorious
game
besieging
the
pigsty
and
all
the
military
orders
had
to
be
given
in
whispers
for
fear
of
us
being
turned
out
if
anyone
passed
and
heard
us
we
found
the
pinewood
and
the
field
and
the
house
had
all
got
boards
to
say
what
would
be
done
to
trespassers
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
it
was
such
a
swat
untying
the
knots
in
the
that
we
only
undid
one
and
then
we
bought
them
a
new
line
with
our
own
and
kept
the
in
a
hidden
bed
of
nettles
always
on
the
spot
and
ready
for
us
we
found
a
way
of
going
round
and
getting
to
the
house
through
a
hole
in
a
hedge
and
across
a
lane
so
as
not
to
go
across
the
big
fields
where
every
human
eye
could
mark
our
proceedings
and
come
after
us
and
tell
us
not
to
we
went
there
every
day
it
would
have
been
a
terrible
thing
if
an
army
of
bloodthirsty
saracens
had
chosen
that
way
to
march
on
london
for
there
was
hardly
ever
a
in
the
tower
now
it
was
a
jolly
place
to
play
in
and
oswald
had
found
out
what
chancery
really
means
so
he
had
no
fear
of
being
turned
into
a
lady
or
marble
from
the
waist
down
and
after
a
bit
we
began
to
want
to
get
into
the
house
and
we
wanted
it
so
much
that
our
hearts
got
quite
cold
about
the
and
the
pigsty
which
at
first
had
been
a
fairy
dream
of
delight
but
the
doors
were
all
locked
we
got
all
the
old
keys
we
could
but
they
were
all
the
keys
of
desks
and
workboxes
and
and
not
the
right
size
or
shape
for
doors
then
one
day
oswald
with
his
justly
celebrated
observingness
noticed
that
one
of
the
bars
was
loose
in
the
brickwork
of
a
sort
of
window
to
pull
it
out
was
to
the
youth
but
the
work
of
a
moment
he
got
down
through
the
gap
thus
obtained
and
found
himself
in
a
place
like
a
very
small
area
only
with
no
steps
and
with
bars
above
him
broken
glass
and
matted
rags
and
straw
beneath
his
enterprising
boots
and
on
one
side
a
small
cobwebby
window
he
got
out
again
and
told
the
others
who
were
trying
to
get
up
the
cobblestones
by
the
stable
so
as
to
make
an
underground
passage
into
the
stable
at
the
ratty
corner
of
its
door
they
came
at
once
and
after
a
brief
discussion
it
was
decided
to
break
the
window
a
little
more
than
it
was
already
and
to
try
to
get
in
a
hand
that
could
unlatch
the
window
of
course
as
oswald
had
found
the
bar
it
was
to
be
his
hand
the
dauntless
oswald
took
off
his
jacket
and
wrapping
it
round
his
fist
shoved
at
the
pane
nearest
the
window
fastening
the
glass
fell
inwards
with
the
noise
you
would
expect
in
newspapers
i
suppose
they
would
call
it
a
sickening
thud
really
it
was
a
sort
of
hollow
tinkling
sound
it
made
even
oswald
jump
and
said
the
window
opens
straight
into
a
bottomless
well
we
did
not
think
this
likely
but
you
can
not
be
too
careful
when
you
are
exploring
oswald
got
in
his
hand
and
undid
the
window
fastening
which
was
very
rusty
the
window
opened
out
like
a
door
there
was
only
just
room
in
the
area
under
the
bars
for
oswald
and
the
opening
of
the
window
he
leaned
forward
and
looked
in
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
not
a
well
after
all
but
a
cellar
on
he
said
all
right
dicky
came
on
so
rapidly
that
his
boots
grazed
the
shoulder
of
the
advancing
oswald
alice
was
coming
next
but
noël
begged
her
to
wait
do
think
ought
to
go
in
till
we
sure
it
safe
he
said
and
oswald
hopes
it
was
not
because
noël
was
in
a
funk
himself
though
with
a
poet
you
never
know
the
cellar
into
which
oswald
now
plunged
had
a
damp
and
mouldering
smell
like
of
and
straw
and
another
cellar
opened
out
of
it
and
in
this
there
was
traces
of
coal
having
existed
in
other
ages
passing
the
we
went
out
to
a
cellar
with
shelves
on
the
wall
like
berths
in
a
ship
or
the
catacombs
where
early
christians
used
to
be
bricked
up
of
course
we
knew
it
was
only
a
because
we
have
one
at
home
matches
had
to
be
used
here
then
we
found
a
flight
of
stone
steps
and
went
up
and
oswald
is
not
ashamed
to
own
that
the
staircase
being
of
a
twisty
nature
he
did
think
what
it
would
be
like
if
he
and
dicky
were
to
meet
something
at
one
of
the
corners
but
all
was
peace
and
solitude
yet
it
was
with
joy
and
like
meeting
an
old
friend
that
we
got
out
of
the
cellars
stairs
and
through
a
door
to
the
where
the
sink
was
and
the
copper
and
the
oswald
felt
like
a
brother
to
the
broken
our
first
instant
thought
was
the
back
door
it
was
bolted
top
and
bottom
and
the
bolts
were
sort
of
cemented
into
their
places
with
rust
but
they
were
unable
to
resist
our
patient
and
determined
onslaught
only
when
we
had
undone
them
the
door
kept
shut
and
by
stooping
down
and
looking
we
saw
that
this
was
because
it
was
locked
dicky
at
once
despaired
and
said
no
go
but
the
researchful
oswald
looked
round
and
there
was
a
key
on
a
nail
which
shows
how
wrong
it
is
to
despair
it
was
not
the
right
key
proving
later
to
be
the
key
of
the
so
we
went
into
the
hall
there
was
a
bunch
of
keys
on
a
nail
on
the
back
of
the
now
you
see
i
was
right
remarked
oswald
and
he
was
as
is
so
often
the
case
all
the
keys
had
labels
and
one
of
these
said
so
we
applied
it
at
once
and
the
locked
door
yielded
to
it
can
bring
in
quite
safely
oswald
said
when
the
door
had
creakingly
consented
to
open
itself
and
to
disclose
the
sunshine
and
the
paved
yard
with
the
paving
stones
marked
out
with
green
grass
and
the
interested
expressions
on
the
faces
of
alice
and
the
others
quite
safe
it
just
a
house
like
anyone
else
only
it
has
got
any
furniture
in
it
we
went
all
over
the
house
there
were
fourteen
rooms
altogether
fifteen
if
you
counted
the
where
the
was
and
the
copper
and
the
sink
with
the
taps
and
the
brotherly
the
rooms
were
quite
different
from
the
ones
in
old
nurse
house
noël
said
he
thought
all
the
rooms
in
this
house
had
been
the
scene
of
duels
or
elopements
or
concealing
rightful
heirs
the
present
author
know
about
that
but
there
was
a
splendid
cupboardiness
about
the
place
that
spoke
volumes
to
a
discerning
eye
even
the
window
seats
of
which
there
were
six
lifted
up
like
the
lids
of
boxes
and
you
could
have
hidden
a
flying
cavalier
in
any
of
them
if
he
had
been
of
only
medium
height
and
slender
build
like
heroes
with
swords
so
often
are
then
there
were
three
staircases
and
these
must
have
been
darkly
convenient
for
getting
conspirators
away
when
the
king
officers
were
at
the
door
as
so
constantly
happened
in
romantic
times
the
whole
house
was
full
of
ideas
for
ripping
games
and
when
we
came
away
alice
said
must
be
really
better
than
we
know
we
must
have
done
to
deserve
a
find
like
this
worry
said
oswald
uncle
says
you
always
have
to
pay
for
everything
we
have
paid
for
this
yet
this
reflection
like
so
many
of
our
young
hero
was
correct
i
have
not
yet
told
you
about
the
finest
find
of
all
the
fine
finds
we
found
finally
that
looks
very
odd
and
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
or
only
carelessness
i
wonder
whether
other
authors
are
ever
a
prey
to
these
devastating
doubts
this
find
was
on
the
top
floor
it
was
a
room
with
bars
to
the
windows
and
it
was
a
very
odd
shape
you
went
along
a
passage
to
the
door
and
then
there
was
the
room
but
the
room
went
back
along
the
same
way
as
the
passage
had
come
so
that
when
you
went
round
there
no
one
could
see
you
from
the
door
the
door
was
sort
of
in
the
middle
of
the
room
but
i
see
i
must
draw
it
for
you
or
you
will
never
understand
illustration
the
door
that
is
marked
door
was
full
of
agitated
excitement
for
us
because
it
was
a
door
at
all
at
least
not
the
kind
that
you
are
used
to
it
was
a
gate
like
you
have
at
the
top
of
nursery
stairs
in
the
mansions
of
the
rich
and
affluent
but
instead
of
being
halfway
up
it
went
all
the
way
up
so
that
you
could
see
into
the
room
through
the
bars
must
have
kept
tame
lunatics
here
said
dicky
bears
said
o
enchanceried
princes
said
noël
seems
silly
though
said
alice
the
lunatic
or
the
bear
or
the
enchanted
prince
could
always
hide
round
the
corner
when
he
heard
the
keepers
coming
if
he
did
happen
to
want
to
show
off
just
then
this
was
so
and
the
deep
mystery
of
the
way
this
room
was
built
was
never
untwisted
a
russian
prisoner
was
kept
there
said
alice
they
did
not
want
to
look
too
close
for
fear
he
would
shoot
them
with
his
poor
man
perhaps
he
caught
vodka
or
some
other
of
those
awful
foreign
diseases
and
died
in
his
hidden
confinement
it
was
a
most
ripping
room
for
games
the
key
of
it
was
on
the
bunch
labelled
room
we
often
wondered
who
was
have
a
regular
round
of
gaieties
said
oswald
of
us
to
take
it
in
turns
to
have
the
room
and
act
what
they
like
and
the
others
look
through
the
bars
so
next
day
we
did
this
oswald
of
course
dressed
up
in
and
a
sheet
as
the
ghost
of
but
noël
and
screamed
and
would
not
be
calm
till
he
tore
off
the
sheet
and
showed
his
knickerbockers
and
braces
as
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
alice
put
her
hair
up
and
got
a
skirt
and
a
large
handkerchief
to
cry
in
and
was
a
hapless
maiden
imprisoned
in
a
tower
because
she
would
not
marry
the
wicked
baron
oswald
instantly
took
the
part
of
the
wicked
baron
and
dicky
was
the
virtuous
lover
of
low
degree
and
they
had
a
splendid
combat
and
dicky
carried
off
the
lady
of
course
that
was
the
proper
end
to
the
story
and
oswald
had
to
pretend
to
be
beaten
which
was
not
the
case
dicky
was
louis
xvi
while
waiting
for
the
guillotine
to
happen
so
we
were
the
guillotine
and
he
was
executed
in
the
paved
yard
noël
was
an
imprisoned
troubadour
dressed
in
bright
antimacassars
and
he
fired
off
quite
a
lot
of
poetry
at
us
before
we
could
get
the
door
open
which
was
most
unfair
was
a
clown
he
had
no
fancy
dress
except
flour
and
two
turkish
towels
pinned
on
to
look
like
trousers
but
he
put
the
flour
all
over
himself
and
it
took
the
rest
of
the
day
to
clean
him
it
was
when
alice
was
drying
the
that
she
had
washed
after
brushing
the
flour
out
of
noël
hair
in
the
that
oswald
said
know
what
that
room
was
made
for
and
everyone
said
which
is
not
manners
but
your
brothers
and
sisters
do
not
mind
because
it
saves
time
said
oswald
you
see
they
kept
a
sentinel
at
the
door
that
a
door
and
if
anyone
approached
he
whispered
why
have
iron
bars
extra
safety
said
oswald
if
their
nefarious
fires
were
not
burning
he
need
not
say
at
all
it
no
use
saying
anything
for
nothing
it
is
curious
but
the
others
did
not
seem
to
see
this
clear
distinguishedness
all
people
have
not
the
same
fine
brains
but
all
the
same
the
idea
rankled
in
their
hearts
and
one
day
father
came
and
took
dicky
up
to
london
about
that
tooth
of
his
and
when
dicky
came
back
he
said
here
talking
of
coiners
there
was
a
man
in
swithin
lane
selling
little
bottles
of
yellow
stuff
and
he
rubbed
some
of
it
on
a
penny
and
it
turned
the
penny
into
a
before
your
eyes
a
new
it
was
a
penny
a
bottle
so
i
bought
three
bottles
always
thought
the
plant
for
coining
was
very
expensive
said
alice
they
tell
you
that
to
keep
you
from
doing
it
because
of
its
being
a
crime
said
dicky
now
i
got
this
stuff
we
can
begin
to
be
coiners
right
away
i
believe
it
is
really
a
crime
unless
you
try
to
buy
things
with
the
base
coin
so
that
very
afternoon
directly
after
dinner
which
had
a
suet
pudding
in
it
that
might
have
weighed
down
the
enterprising
spirit
of
anyone
but
us
we
went
over
to
the
enchanceried
house
we
found
our
good
rope
ladder
among
its
congealing
bed
of
trusty
nettles
and
got
over
into
the
paved
yard
and
through
the
oswald
always
carried
the
key
of
this
hung
round
his
neck
by
a
bootlace
as
if
it
was
a
talisman
or
the
hair
of
his
lost
love
of
course
oswald
never
had
a
lost
love
he
would
scorn
the
action
but
some
heroes
do
have
something
or
other
which
means
one
man
meat
is
another
man
poison
when
we
got
up
into
the
room
with
the
door
it
all
seemed
very
bare
three
bottles
of
yellow
stuff
and
tenpence
halfpenny
in
coppers
is
not
much
to
start
a
coining
enterprise
with
ought
to
make
it
like
coining
anyway
said
oswald
have
furnaces
said
dicky
alice
said
a
do
old
nurse
has
got
an
old
one
on
the
scullery
shelf
we
thought
it
would
then
noël
reminded
us
that
coiners
have
moulds
and
oswald
went
and
bought
a
pair
of
wooden
lemon
squeezers
for
sevenpence
three
farthings
in
his
he
remembered
that
coiners
use
water
so
he
bought
two
enamelled
iron
bowls
at
sixpence
halfpenny
the
two
when
he
came
back
he
noticed
the
we
had
always
felt
so
friendly
to
and
he
filled
it
with
water
and
brought
it
up
it
did
not
leak
worth
mentioning
ought
to
have
a
bench
said
dicky
trades
have
that
shoemakers
and
watchmakers
and
tailors
and
lawyers
this
was
difficult
but
we
did
it
there
were
some
planks
in
the
cellar
and
a
tub
and
a
unluckily
the
tub
and
the
were
not
the
same
height
but
we
taught
them
better
by
getting
old
progress
and
the
to
put
on
top
of
the
tub
and
then
it
was
as
high
as
the
barrel
and
we
laid
the
boards
across
and
there
was
a
bench
as
beautiful
as
you
could
wish
dicky
was
allowed
to
put
the
stuff
on
the
coins
because
he
had
bought
the
bottles
with
his
own
money
but
alice
held
them
for
him
to
do
because
girls
are
inferior
beings
except
when
you
are
ill
and
you
must
be
kind
to
them
or
you
need
never
hope
to
be
a
hero
there
are
drawbacks
to
every
ambition
she
let
noël
hold
them
part
of
the
time
when
she
was
not
helping
dicky
she
tried
covering
pennies
with
the
silver
paper
off
chocolate
but
it
was
not
the
kind
of
success
that
would
take
anyone
in
and
noël
took
it
in
turns
to
be
sentinel
but
they
said
it
was
dull
so
oswald
took
it
on
and
before
he
had
been
there
three
minutes
he
cried
someone
approaches
and
the
coining
materials
were
hastily
concealed
and
everyone
hid
round
the
corner
like
we
had
agreed
we
would
do
if
disturbed
in
our
unlawful
pursuits
of
course
there
was
anyone
really
after
this
the
kids
wanted
to
be
sentinels
again
but
oswald
would
not
let
them
it
was
a
jolly
good
game
and
there
was
something
about
that
house
that
made
whatever
you
played
in
it
seem
awfully
real
when
i
was
i
felt
quite
unhappy
and
when
dicky
was
the
unfortunate
monarch
who
perished
in
the
french
revolution
he
told
me
afterwards
he
did
half
like
it
when
it
came
to
the
guillotine
though
of
course
he
knew
the
knife
was
only
the
little
of
the
we
played
coiners
for
several
days
and
all
learned
to
give
the
alarm
but
we
were
beginning
to
feel
it
was
time
for
something
new
noël
was
saving
the
hairs
out
of
his
comb
and
pulling
them
out
of
the
horsehair
sofa
in
the
parlour
to
make
a
hair
shirt
to
be
a
hermit
in
and
oswald
had
bought
a
file
to
get
through
the
bars
and
be
an
escaped
bastille
prisoner
leaving
his
concealed
in
the
fireplace
when
the
great
event
occurred
we
found
the
silvered
money
turned
to
a
dirty
black
when
a
few
hours
had
elapsed
and
we
tried
silver
paint
and
gold
paint
our
pockets
were
always
full
of
gold
and
silver
money
and
we
could
jingle
it
and
take
it
out
in
handfuls
and
let
people
see
it
not
too
near
then
came
the
great
eventful
day
had
fallen
into
the
that
morning
we
dried
his
holland
smock
but
it
went
stiff
like
paper
so
that
old
nurse
noticed
it
and
thus
found
out
that
he
was
wringing
wet
underneath
so
she
put
him
to
bed
for
fear
of
his
catching
his
death
of
cold
and
the
inveterate
gang
of
coiners
had
to
go
to
their
fell
lair
without
him
we
left
all
our
false
money
at
home
because
old
nurse
had
given
alice
a
piece
of
trimming
for
dolls
that
was
all
over
little
imitation
silver
coins
called
sequences
i
believe
to
imitate
the
coinage
of
turkish
regions
we
reached
our
enchanceried
house
got
in
as
usual
and
started
our
desperate
work
of
changing
silver
sequences
into
gold
with
gold
paint
noël
was
very
grumpy
he
was
odd
altogether
that
day
he
was
trying
to
write
a
poem
about
a
bastille
prisoner
he
asked
to
be
sentry
so
that
he
could
think
about
rhymes
we
had
not
coined
more
than
about
four
when
we
heard
noël
say
hide
the
plant
we
did
take
any
notice
because
we
wanted
to
get
enough
of
them
done
to
play
a
game
of
misers
which
was
alice
idea
noël
said
again
and
then
suddenly
he
rushed
in
and
said
a
hist
i
tell
you
there
someone
on
the
stairs
and
he
shut
the
door
and
oswald
with
rare
presence
of
mind
caught
up
the
bunch
of
keys
and
locked
the
door
with
the
key
labelled
room
then
breathless
and
furtive
we
all
hid
in
the
part
of
the
room
near
the
fireplace
where
no
one
could
see
us
from
the
door
we
hardly
dared
to
breathe
alice
said
afterwards
that
she
could
hear
oswald
heart
beating
with
terror
but
the
author
is
almost
sure
that
it
was
only
his
watch
ticking
it
had
begun
to
go
that
week
after
days
of
unexplained
idleness
if
we
have
to
pay
for
finding
the
enchanceried
house
this
was
when
we
paid
there
feet
on
the
stairs
we
all
heard
them
and
voices
the
author
distinctly
heard
the
words
with
every
modern
inconvenience
and
situate
ten
minutes
from
tram
and
rail
and
oswald
at
least
understood
that
somehow
or
other
our
house
had
got
itself
disenchanceried
and
that
the
owner
was
trying
to
let
it
we
held
our
breaths
till
they
were
nearly
choked
out
of
us
the
steps
came
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
along
the
passage
and
stopped
at
the
door
is
the
nursery
said
a
manly
voice
locked
i
quite
understood
from
the
agent
that
the
keys
were
in
the
hall
of
course
had
the
keys
and
this
was
the
moment
that
noël
chose
for
dropping
them
why
he
was
fingering
them
where
they
lay
on
the
mantelpiece
the
author
does
not
know
and
never
will
know
there
is
something
about
demented
in
some
latin
chap
virgil
or
lucretius
that
seems
to
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
the
keys
fell
on
the
cracked
hearthstone
with
a
clang
that
oswald
at
any
rate
will
never
forget
there
was
an
awful
silence
quite
a
long
one
then
another
voice
said
someone
in
there
at
that
bench
said
the
other
man
coiners
work
what
it
is
but
there
nobody
there
the
keys
must
have
down
the
two
voices
talked
some
time
but
we
could
not
hear
all
their
conversation
we
were
all
wondering
as
it
turned
out
afterwards
what
exactly
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
was
because
of
course
we
knew
we
were
trespassers
of
the
very
deepest
dye
even
if
we
could
prove
that
we
were
not
real
coiners
we
heard
one
of
them
say
we
go
for
the
police
very
likely
the
gang
will
return
and
destroy
everything
there
no
one
here
now
secure
the
evidence
we
can
easily
break
the
door
down
it
is
a
sickening
feeling
when
the
evidence
against
you
is
going
to
be
secured
and
you
do
know
what
the
punishment
for
coining
is
or
whether
anyone
will
believe
you
if
you
say
you
were
only
playing
at
it
we
exchanged
pallid
glances
we
could
hear
the
two
men
shaking
the
door
and
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
just
how
weak
it
was
never
having
seriously
tampered
with
it
ourselves
it
was
then
that
noël
suddenly
went
quite
mad
i
think
it
was
due
to
something
old
nurse
had
read
to
us
at
breakfast
that
day
about
a
boy
of
eight
who
played
on
the
fiddle
and
composed
pieces
of
music
affected
young
ass
he
darted
from
us
into
the
middle
of
the
room
where
the
two
intruders
could
see
him
and
said
break
down
the
door
the
villains
may
return
any
moment
and
destroy
you
fetch
the
police
the
surprised
outsiders
could
find
no
word
but
are
surprised
to
see
me
here
said
noël
not
taking
any
notice
of
the
furious
looks
of
the
rest
of
us
am
an
infant
prodigy
i
play
the
violin
at
concerts
i
play
it
beautifully
they
take
me
to
london
to
play
in
a
closed
carriage
so
that
i
ca
tell
anyone
my
woes
on
the
way
poor
child
said
one
of
the
outsiders
us
all
about
it
we
must
rescue
you
of
poor
but
honest
parents
said
noël
and
this
was
what
nurse
had
read
out
to
us
musical
talent
early
manifested
itself
on
a
toy
violin
the
gift
of
a
devoted
torn
from
my
home
i
say
do
fetch
the
police
if
the
monsters
who
live
on
my
return
and
find
you
here
they
will
brain
you
with
the
tools
of
their
trade
and
i
shall
be
lost
trade
said
one
of
them
trade
are
coiners
said
noël
well
as
what
they
do
to
me
to
make
me
play
if
we
leave
you
they
wo
hurt
cried
noël
i
have
to
play
at
exeter
hall
fly
fly
for
the
police
they
may
come
up
behind
you
any
moment
and
cleave
you
to
the
chine
and
they
actually
flew
the
present
author
would
have
known
instantly
that
it
was
rot
that
about
cleaving
chines
but
the
man
who
wanted
to
let
the
disenchanteried
house
and
the
man
who
wanted
to
have
it
let
to
him
were
of
other
mettle
we
had
remained
perfectly
still
and
silent
of
course
if
the
outsiders
had
attacked
noël
his
brothers
would
have
rushed
to
his
rescue
as
soon
as
the
retreating
boots
of
the
outsiders
grew
fainter
on
the
stairs
noël
turned
green
and
had
to
be
revived
by
splashings
from
the
brotherly
full
of
water
he
got
better
directly
and
we
all
scooted
home
to
old
nurse
leaving
our
coining
plant
without
a
pang
all
great
generals
say
that
a
retreat
is
best
conducted
without
impediments
noël
was
so
ill
he
had
to
go
to
bed
and
stay
there
this
was
as
well
because
of
the
neighbourhood
being
scoured
for
the
infant
prodigy
that
had
been
imprisoned
in
the
enchanceried
house
he
got
all
right
again
in
time
to
go
home
when
father
came
up
for
us
while
he
was
in
bed
he
wrote
a
long
poem
in
six
different
coloured
chalks
called
enchanceried
coiners
or
the
liar
remorse
so
i
know
he
was
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
he
told
me
he
could
not
think
what
made
him
and
of
course
it
was
very
wrong
but
it
did
save
our
bacon
and
preserve
us
from
the
noisome
cells
and
bread
and
water
that
i
am
sure
are
the
real
meaning
of
the
rigour
of
the
law
really
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
while
we
were
trembling
in
the
coiners
den
with
the
two
outside
gentlemen
snorting
and
whispering
on
the
other
side
of
the
had
got
up
out
of
his
bed
at
home
and
answered
the
door
old
nurse
had
gone
out
to
get
a
lettuce
and
an
aerated
loaf
for
tea
he
answered
it
to
a
butcher
bill
for
fifteen
and
sevenpence
that
the
butcher
little
girl
had
brought
and
he
paid
it
with
six
of
the
pennies
that
we
had
disguised
as
and
told
the
little
girl
to
call
for
the
sevenpence
in
the
morning
i
believe
many
people
have
been
hanged
for
less
it
was
lucky
for
that
old
nurse
was
a
friend
of
the
butcher
and
able
to
persuade
him
that
it
was
only
a
joke
in
sterner
times
like
the
french
revolution
but
alice
does
not
like
to
think
what
would
have
happened
then
as
this
is
the
twentieth
century
and
not
the
eighteenth
our
all
going
down
to
the
butcher
and
saying
we
were
sorry
made
it
all
right
but
suppose
it
had
been
in
other
dates
the
butcher
wife
gave
us
cake
and
ginger
wine
and
was
very
jolly
she
asked
us
where
we
had
got
the
false
oswald
said
they
had
been
given
us
this
was
true
but
when
they
were
given
us
they
were
pennies
did
oswald
tell
a
lie
to
the
butcher
he
has
often
wondered
he
hopes
not
it
is
easy
to
know
whether
a
thing
is
a
lie
or
not
when
nothing
depends
on
it
but
when
events
are
happening
and
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
may
be
the
result
of
your
making
a
mistake
you
have
to
tell
the
truth
as
carefully
as
you
can
no
english
gentleman
tells
a
lie
oswald
knows
that
of
course
but
an
englishman
is
not
obliged
to
criminalate
himself
the
rules
of
honour
and
the
laws
of
your
country
are
very
puzzling
and
contradictory
but
the
butcher
got
paid
afterwards
in
real
money
a
and
two
and
seven
unsilvered
pennies
so
nobody
was
injured
and
the
author
thinks
that
is
the
great
thing
after
all
all
the
same
if
ever
he
goes
to
stay
with
old
nurse
again
he
thinks
he
will
tell
the
butcher
all
in
confidence
he
does
not
like
to
have
any
doubts
about
such
a
serious
thing
as
the
honour
of
a
bastable
the
end
of
oswald
part
of
the
book
others
illustration
little
person
in
a
large
white
cap
page
molly
the
measles
and
the
missing
will
we
all
think
a
great
deal
too
much
of
ourselves
we
all
believe
every
man
woman
and
child
of
us
in
our
very
insidest
inside
heart
that
no
one
else
in
the
world
is
at
all
like
us
and
that
things
happen
to
us
that
happen
to
no
one
else
now
this
is
a
great
mistake
because
however
different
we
may
be
in
the
colour
of
our
hair
and
eyes
the
inside
part
the
part
that
we
feel
and
suffer
with
is
pretty
much
alike
in
all
of
us
but
no
one
seems
to
know
this
except
me
that
is
why
people
wo
tell
you
the
really
wonderful
things
that
happen
to
them
they
think
you
are
so
different
that
you
could
never
believe
the
wonderful
things
but
of
course
you
are
not
different
really
and
you
can
believe
wonderful
things
as
easily
as
anybody
else
for
instance
you
will
be
able
to
believe
this
story
quite
easily
for
though
it
did
happen
to
you
that
was
merely
an
accident
it
might
have
happened
quite
easily
to
you
or
any
else
as
it
happened
it
happened
to
maria
toodlethwaite
carruthers
you
will
already
have
felt
a
little
sorry
for
maria
and
you
will
have
thought
that
i
might
have
chosen
a
prettier
name
for
her
and
so
i
might
but
i
did
not
do
the
choosing
her
parents
did
that
and
they
called
her
maria
after
an
aunt
who
was
disagreeable
and
would
have
been
more
disagreeable
than
ever
if
the
baby
had
been
called
enid
or
elaine
or
vivien
or
any
of
the
pretty
names
that
will
readily
occur
to
you
she
was
called
toodlethwaite
after
the
eminent
uncle
of
that
name
who
had
an
office
in
london
and
an
office
in
liverpool
and
was
said
to
be
rolling
in
money
like
to
see
uncle
toodlethwaite
rolling
in
his
money
said
maria
he
never
does
it
when
i
about
the
third
name
carruthers
was
maria
father
name
and
she
often
felt
thankful
that
it
was
no
worse
it
might
so
easily
have
been
snooks
or
prosser
of
course
no
one
called
maria
maria
except
aunt
maria
herself
her
aunt
eliza
who
was
very
refined
always
wrote
in
the
improving
books
that
she
gave
maria
on
her
birthday
dearest
marie
from
her
affectionate
aunt
elise
and
when
she
spoke
to
her
she
called
her
mawrie
her
brothers
and
sisters
whenever
they
wanted
to
be
aggravating
called
her
toodles
but
at
times
of
common
friendliness
they
called
her
molly
and
so
did
most
other
people
and
so
shall
i
and
so
may
you
molly
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
were
taken
care
of
by
a
young
woman
who
was
called
a
i
do
know
why
for
she
did
not
nurse
them
and
she
certainly
did
not
govern
them
in
her
last
situation
she
had
been
called
a
i
do
know
the
why
of
that
either
her
name
was
simpshall
and
she
was
always
saying
and
must
do
that
and
that
down
directly
and
shall
tell
your
mamma
if
you
do
leave
off
she
never
seemed
to
know
what
you
ought
to
do
but
only
what
you
ought
one
day
the
children
had
a
grand
battle
with
all
the
toy
soldiers
and
the
little
brass
cannons
that
shoot
peas
and
the
other
kind
that
shoot
pink
caps
with
on
the
box
bertie
who
always
liked
to
have
everything
as
real
as
possible
did
not
like
the
soldiers
to
be
standing
on
the
bare
polished
mahogany
of
the
not
a
bit
like
the
field
of
glory
he
said
and
indeed
it
was
not
so
he
borrowed
the
large
kitchen
and
went
out
and
brought
it
in
full
of
nice
real
clean
mould
out
of
the
garden
half
a
dozen
were
needed
to
cover
the
table
then
the
children
made
forts
and
ditches
and
brought
in
sprigs
of
geranium
and
calceolaria
and
box
and
yew
and
made
trees
and
ambushes
and
hedges
it
was
a
lovely
battlefield
and
would
have
melted
the
heart
of
anyone
but
a
but
she
just
said
a
disgusting
mess
how
naughty
you
are
and
fetched
a
brush
and
swept
the
field
of
glory
away
into
the
dustpan
there
was
only
just
time
to
save
the
lives
of
the
soldiers
and
then
cecily
put
the
back
without
saying
what
it
had
been
used
for
and
the
knives
were
put
into
it
so
that
at
dinner
everything
tasted
of
earth
and
the
grit
got
between
people
teeth
so
that
they
could
not
eat
their
mutton
or
potatoes
or
cabbage
or
even
their
gravy
this
of
course
was
entirely
miss
simpshall
fault
if
she
had
not
behaved
as
she
did
bertie
or
eva
would
have
remembered
to
clean
out
the
as
it
was
the
story
of
the
field
of
glory
came
out
over
the
gritty
mutton
and
things
and
father
sent
all
the
to
bed
molly
was
out
of
this
she
was
staying
with
aunt
eliza
who
was
kind
if
refined
she
was
to
come
back
the
next
day
but
as
mother
was
on
her
way
to
the
station
to
meet
aunt
maria
for
a
day
shopping
she
met
a
telegraph
boy
who
gave
her
a
telegram
from
aunt
eliza
saying
going
to
palace
instead
of
fetch
elise
so
mother
fetched
her
from
aunt
eliza
flat
in
kensington
and
took
her
shopping
with
aunt
maria
there
were
hours
of
shopping
in
hot
stuffy
shops
full
of
tired
and
angry
ladies
and
even
the
new
hat
and
jacket
and
the
strawberry
ice
at
the
pastrycook
in
oxford
street
did
not
make
up
to
molly
for
that
tiresome
day
still
she
was
out
of
the
battlefield
row
only
as
she
did
not
know
that
it
could
not
comfort
her
when
aunt
maria
had
been
put
into
her
train
mother
and
molly
went
home
as
their
cab
stopped
miss
simpshall
rushed
out
between
the
two
dusty
laburnums
by
the
gate
come
in
said
miss
simpshall
wildly
dear
miss
simpshall
said
mother
the
hair
of
the
waved
wildly
in
the
evening
breeze
she
shut
the
ornamental
iron
gate
in
mother
face
come
in
said
miss
simpshall
again
sha
you
must
talk
nonsense
said
mother
looking
very
white
you

mad
miss
simpshall
said
she
had
what
the
matter
said
mother
said
miss
simpshall
all
out
on
them

mother

thought

as
soon
molly

thanks

train
it
a
blessing
molly
clothes
are
all
here
in
her
box
so
molly
was
whisked
off
in
the
cab
must
take
you
back
to
your
aunt
said
mother
aunt
eliza
gone
to
stay
at
the
bishop
palace
said
molly
she
has
we
must
go
to
your
aunt
maria
oh
dear
mind
mother
said
molly
slipping
her
hand
into
mother
they
wo
have
it
very
badly
and
i
be
very
good
and
try
not
to
have
it
at
all
this
was
very
brave
of
molly
she
would
much
rather
have
had
measles
than
have
gone
to
stay
at
aunt
maria
aunt
maria
lived
in
a
lovely
old
house
down
in
kent
it
had
beautiful
furniture
and
beautiful
gardens
in
fact
as
bertie
said
it
was
a
place
every
prospect
pleases
and
only
aunt
is
vile
molly
and
her
mother
arrived
there
just
at
aunt
maria
was
very
surprised
and
displeased
molly
went
to
bed
at
once
and
her
supper
was
brought
up
on
a
tray
by
clements
aunt
own
maid
it
was
cold
lamb
and
and
jelly
and
custard
aunt
said
to
bring
you
biscuits
and
milk
said
clements
i
thought
you
like
this
better
a
darling
said
molly
was
so
afraid
you
be
gone
for
your
holiday
it
not
nearly
so
beastly
when
you
here
clements
was
flattered
and
returned
the
compliment
you
are
so
bad
when
you
good
miss
she
said
it
up
i
come
back
and
bring
you
a
one
thing
molly
liked
about
aunt
maria
was
that
there
were
no
children
bedrooms
no
bare
rooms
with
painted
furniture
and
dutch
drugget
all
the
rooms
were
rooms
with
soft
carpets
and
splendid
old
furniture
the
beds
were
all
with
carved
pillars
and
silk
damask
curtains
and
there
were
sure
to
be
the
loveliest
things
to
make
believe
with
in
whatever
room
you
happened
to
be
put
into
in
this
room
there
were
cases
of
stuffed
birds
and
a
stuffed
pike
that
was
just
like
life
there
was
a
wonderful
old
cabinet
black
and
red
and
gold
very
mysterious
and
oak
chests
and
two
fat
white
indian
idols
sitting
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
very
delightful
but
molly
liked
it
best
in
the
daytime
and
she
was
glad
of
the
she
thought
of
bertie
and
cicely
and
eva
and
baby
and
vincent
and
wondered
whether
measles
hurt
much
next
day
aunt
maria
was
quite
bearable
the
worst
thing
she
said
was
about
people
coming
when
they
were
expected
and
upsetting
everything
try
not
to
upset
anything
said
molly
and
went
out
and
got
the
gardener
to
put
up
a
swing
for
her
then
she
upset
herself
out
of
it
and
got
a
bump
on
her
forehead
the
size
of
a
hen
egg
and
that
as
aunt
maria
very
properly
said
kept
her
out
of
mischief
for
the
rest
of
the
day
next
morning
molly
had
two
letters
the
first
was
from
bertie
it
said
molly
is
rough
lines
on
you
but
we
did
not
mean
to
keep
it
up
and
it
is
your
fault
for
coming
home
the
day
before
you
ought
to
have
we
did
it
to
kid
old
simpshall
because
she
was
so
beastly
about
us
making
a
real
battlefield
we
only
painted
all
the
parts
of
us
that
show
with
vermilion
and
put
spots
mixed
crimson
lake
and
prussian
blue
all
over
and
we
pulled
down
the
blinds
and
said
our
heads
ached
and
so
they
did
with
crying
i
mean
the
girls
cried
she
was
afraid
to
come
near
us
but
she
was
sorry
she
had
been
such
a
beast
and
when
she
had
come
to
the
door
and
said
so
through
the
keyhole
we
owned
up
but
you
had
gone
by
then
it
was
a
rare
lark
but
we
got
three
days
bedder
for
it
i
shall
lower
this
on
the
end
of
a
fishingline
to
the
baker
boy
and
he
will
post
it
it
is
like
a
dungeon
he
is
going
to
bring
us
tarts
like
a
faithful
page
affectionate
de
lisle
carruthers
the
other
letter
was
from
mother
darling
molly
it
was
all
a
naughty
hoax
intended
to
annoy
poor
miss
simpshall
your
brothers
and
sisters
had
painted
their
faces
red
and
purple
they
had
not
measles
at
all
but
since
you
at
aunt
maria
i
think
you
may
as
well
stay
awful
said
molly
too
bad
stay
and
make
it
your
annual
visit
be
a
good
girl
dear
and
do
not
forget
to
wear
your
pinafores
in
the
morning
loving
mother
molly
wrote
a
nice
little
letter
to
her
mother
to
her
brother
she
said
dear
bertie
i
think
you
are
beasts
to
have
let
me
in
for
this
you
might
have
thought
of
me
i
shall
not
forgive
you
till
the
sun
is
just
going
down
and
i
would
not
then
only
it
is
so
wrong
not
to
i
wish
had
been
named
maria
and
had
to
stay
here
instead
of
me
sister
carruthers
when
molly
stayed
at
the
white
house
she
was
accustomed
to
read
aloud
in
the
mornings
from
children
or
pilgrims
while
aunt
maria
sewed
severely
but
that
morning
aunt
maria
did
not
send
for
her
aunt
not
well
clements
told
her
wo
be
down
before
lunch
run
along
do
miss
and
walk
in
the
garden
like
a
young
lady
molly
chose
rather
to
swagger
out
into
the
stableyard
like
a
young
gentleman
the
groom
was
saddling
the
sorrel
horse
got
to
take
a
telegram
to
the
station
said
he
me
said
molly
and
what
ud
your
aunt
say
wo
know
said
molly
if
she
does
i
say
i
made
you
he
laughed
and
molly
had
a
splendid
ride
behind
the
groom
with
her
arms
so
tight
round
his
waistcoat
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
when
they
got
to
the
station
a
porter
lifted
her
down
and
the
groom
let
her
send
off
the
telegram
it
was
to
uncle
toodlethwaite
and
it
said
come
down
at
once
urgent
business
most
important
do
fail
bring
maria
carruthers
so
molly
knew
something
very
out
of
the
way
had
happened
and
she
was
glad
that
her
aunt
should
have
something
to
think
of
besides
her
because
the
white
house
would
have
been
a
very
nice
place
to
stay
at
if
aunt
maria
had
not
so
often
remembered
to
do
her
duty
by
you
illustration
had
a
splendid
ride
behind
the
groom
page
in
the
afternoon
uncle
toodlethwaite
came
and
he
and
aunt
maria
and
a
person
in
black
with
a
shining
black
bag
molly
supposed
he
was
bates
who
was
to
be
brought
by
uncle
toodlethwaite
sat
in
the
with
the
door
shut
molly
went
to
help
the
kitchenmaid
shell
peas
in
the
little
grass
courtyard
in
the
middle
of
the
house
they
sat
on
the
kitchen
steps
and
molly
could
hear
the
voices
of
clements
and
the
housekeeper
through
the
open
window
of
the
servants
hall
she
heard
but
she
did
not
think
it
was
eavesdropping
or
anything
dishonourable
like
listening
at
doors
they
were
talking
quite
out
loud
a
dreadful
blow
it
will
be
to
us
all
if
true
the
housekeeper
was
saying
thinks
it
true
said
clements
her
eyes
out
she
did
and
wired
for
her
once
removed
her
brother
i
see
but
i
do
know
as
i
really
understand
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
even
yet
it
like
this
said
clements
an
her
brother
they
used
to
live
here
along
of
their
uncle
and
he
had
a
son
a
regular
bad
egg
he
was
and
the
old
master
said
he
should
ever
have
a
penny
of
his
money
he
said
he
leave
it
to
carruthers
that
missis
brother
see
means
father
thought
molly
he
leave
missis
the
house
and
enough
money
to
keep
it
up
in
style
he
was
a
warm
man
it
seems
well
then
the
son
drowned
at
sea
ship
went
down
and
all
aboard
perished
just
as
well
because
when
the
old
man
died
they
could
find
no
will
so
it
all
comes
to
missis
and
her
brother
there
being
no
other
relations
near
or
far
and
they
divides
it
the
same
as
the
old
man
had
always
said
he
wished
you
see
what
i
mean
enough
said
the
housekeeper
then
then
said
clements
this
letter
this
very
morning
from
a
lawyer
to
say
as
this
bad
egg
of
a
son
was
drowned
at
all
he
was
in
foreign
parts
and
only
now
heard
of
his
father
decease
and
tends
without
delay
to
claim
the
property
which
all
comes
to
him
the
deceased
have
died
insensate
that
means
without
a
will
say
clements
molly
sung
out
must
have
read
the
letter
did
aunt
show
it
to
you
there
was
a
dead
silence
the
kitchenmaid
giggled
someone
whispered
inside
the
room
then
the
housekeeper
voice
called
softly
in
here
a
minute
miss
and
the
window
was
sharply
shut
molly
emptied
the
peascods
out
of
her
pinafore
and
went
in
directly
she
was
inside
the
door
clements
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
shook
her
nasty
mean
prying
little
cat
she
said
me
getting
you
jelly
and
custard
and
i
do
know
what
all
not
said
molly
clements
you
hurt
deserve
me
to
was
the
reply
she
mrs
williams
you
know
it
wrong
to
listen
miss
asked
williams
did
listen
said
molly
indignantly
were
simply
shouting
no
one
could
help
hearing
me
and
jane
would
have
had
to
put
our
fingers
in
our
ears
to
hear
did
think
it
of
you
said
clements
beginning
to
sniff
do
know
what
you
making
all
this
fuss
about
said
molly
not
a
sneak
a
piece
of
cake
miss
said
williams
give
me
your
word
it
sha
go
any
further
do
want
your
cake
you
better
give
it
to
clements
it
she
that
tells
things
not
me
molly
began
to
cry
i
declare
miss
i
sorry
i
shook
you
but
i
was
that
put
out
there
i
ask
your
pardon
i
ca
do
more
you
would
get
poor
clements
into
trouble
i
sure
course
i
would
you
might
have
known
that
well
peace
was
restored
but
molly
would
have
any
cake
that
evening
jane
wore
a
new
silver
brooch
shaped
like
a
horseshoe
with
an
arrow
through
it
it
was
after
tea
when
uncle
toodlethwaite
was
gone
that
molly
creeping
quietly
out
to
see
the
pigs
fed
came
upon
her
aunt
at
the
end
of
the
hollyhock
walk
her
aunt
was
sitting
on
the
rustic
seat
that
the
crimson
rambler
rose
makes
an
arbour
over
her
handkerchief
was
held
to
her
face
with
both
hands
and
her
thin
shoulders
were
shaking
with
sobs
and
at
once
molly
forgot
how
disagreeable
aunt
maria
had
always
been
and
how
she
hated
her
she
ran
to
her
aunt
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
aunt
maria
jumped
in
her
seat
but
she
let
the
arms
stay
where
they
were
though
they
made
it
quite
difficult
for
her
to
use
her
handkerchief
cry
dear
ducky
aunt
maria
said
molly
do
what
the
matter
you
would
understand
said
aunt
maria
gruffly
away
and
play
there
a
good
child
i
do
want
to
play
while
you
crying
i
sure
i
could
understand
dear
little
auntie
molly
embraced
the
tall
gaunt
figure
of
the
aunt
little
auntie
tell
molly
she
used
just
the
tone
she
was
used
to
use
to
her
baby
brother
it
business
said
aunt
maria
sniffing
know
business
is
dreadfully
bad
father
says
so
said
molly
send
me
away
auntie
i
be
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
i
just
sit
and
cuddle
you
till
you
feel
better
she
got
her
arms
round
the
aunt
waist
and
snuggled
her
head
against
a
thin
arm
aunt
maria
had
always
been
one
for
keeping
children
in
their
proper
places
yet
somehow
now
molly
proper
place
seemed
to
be
just
where
she
was
where
she
had
never
been
before
a
kind
little
girl
maria
she
said
presently
wish
i
could
do
something
said
molly
you
feel
better
if
you
told
me
they
say
it
does
you
good
not
to
grieve
in
solitary
concealment
i
sure
i
could
understand
if
you
did
use
long
words
and
curiously
enough
aunt
maria
did
tell
her
almost
exactly
what
she
had
heard
from
clements
i
know
there
was
a
will
leaving
it
all
to
your
father
and
me
she
said
saw
it
signed
it
was
witnessed
by
the
butler
we
had
then
he
died
the
year
after
and
by
sheldon
he
died
too
out
hunting
her
voice
softened
and
molly
snuggled
closer
and
said
mr
sheldon
and
i
were
to
have
been
married
said
aunt
maria
suddenly
his
picture
in
the
hall
between
the
carp
and
your
carruthers
auntie
said
molly
thinking
of
the
handsome
man
in
scarlet
next
the
stuffed
carp
poor
auntie
i
do
love
you
so
aunt
maria
put
an
arm
round
her
my
dear
she
said
do
understand
all
the
happy
things
that
ever
happened
to
me
happened
here
and
all
the
sad
things
too
if
they
turn
me
out
i
shall
die
i
know
i
shall
it
been
bad
enough
she
went
on
more
to
herself
than
to
molly
there
always
been
the
place
just
as
it
was
when
i
was
a
girl
when
he
used
to
come
here
so
bold
and
laughing
he
always
was
i
can
see
him
here
quite
plainly
only
to
shut
my
eyes
but
i
could
see
him
anywhere
else
wills
get
hidden
away
sometimes
molly
asked
for
she
had
read
stories
about
such
things
looked
everywhere
said
aunt
maria
we
had
detectives
from
london
because
there
were
things
he
left
to
other
people
and
we
wanted
to
carry
out
his
wishes
but
we
could
find
it
uncle
must
have
destroyed
it
and
meant
to
make
another
only
he
never
did
he
never
did
oh
i
hope
the
dead
ca
see
what
we
suffer
if
my
uncle
carruthers
and
dear
james
could
see
me
turned
out
of
the
old
place
it
would
break
their
hearts
even
up
in
heaven
molly
was
silent
suddenly
her
aunt
seemed
to
awake
from
a
dream
gracious
child
she
said
nonsense
i
been
talking
go
away
and
play
and
forget
all
about
it
your
own
troubles
will
begin
soon
enough
do
love
you
auntie
said
molly
and
went
aunt
maria
never
unbent
again
as
she
had
done
that
evening
but
molly
felt
a
difference
that
made
all
the
difference
she
was
not
afraid
of
her
aunt
now
and
she
loved
her
besides
things
were
happening
the
white
house
was
now
the
most
interesting
place
in
the
world
be
sure
that
molly
set
to
work
at
once
to
look
for
the
missing
will
london
detectives
were
very
careless
she
was
certain
they
were
she
opened
drawers
and
felt
in
the
backs
of
cupboards
she
prodded
the
padding
of
chairs
listening
for
the
crackling
of
paper
inside
among
the
stuffing
she
tapped
the
woodwork
of
the
house
all
over
for
secret
panels
but
she
did
not
find
the
will
she
could
not
believe
that
her
carruthers
would
have
been
so
silly
as
to
burn
a
will
that
he
knew
might
be
wanted
at
any
moment
she
used
to
stand
in
front
of
his
portrait
and
look
at
it
he
did
not
look
at
all
silly
and
she
used
to
look
at
the
portrait
of
handsome
laughing
sheldon
who
had
been
killed
out
hunting
instead
of
marrying
aunt
maria
and
more
than
once
she
said
might
tell
me
where
it
is
you
look
as
if
you
knew
but
he
never
altered
his
jolly
smile
molly
thought
of
missing
wills
from
the
moment
her
eyes
opened
in
the
morning
to
the
time
when
they
closed
at
night
then
came
the
dreadful
day
when
uncle
toodlethwaite
and
bates
came
down
and
uncle
toodlethwaite
said
afraid
there
no
help
for
it
maria
you
can
delay
the
thing
a
bit
but
you
have
to
turn
out
in
the
end
it
was
on
that
night
that
the
wonderful
thing
happened
the
thing
that
molly
has
never
told
to
anyone
except
me
because
she
thought
no
one
could
believe
it
she
went
to
bed
as
usual
and
to
sleep
and
she
woke
suddenly
hearing
someone
call
molly
she
sat
up
in
bed
the
room
was
full
of
moonlight
as
usual
her
first
waking
thought
was
of
the
missing
will
had
it
been
found
was
her
aunt
calling
her
to
tell
the
good
news
no
the
room
was
quite
still
she
was
alone
the
moonlight
fell
full
on
the
old
black
and
red
and
gold
cabinet
that
she
had
often
thought
was
just
the
place
where
a
will
would
be
hidden
it
might
have
a
secret
drawer
that
the
london
detectives
had
missed
she
had
often
looked
over
it
carefully
but
now
she
got
out
of
bed
and
lighted
her
candle
and
went
over
to
the
cabinet
to
have
one
more
look
she
opened
all
the
drawers
pressed
all
the
knobs
in
the
carved
brasswork
there
was
a
little
door
in
the
middle
she
knew
that
the
little
cupboard
behind
it
was
empty
it
had
red
lacquered
walls
and
the
back
wall
was
she
opened
the
little
cupboard
held
up
her
candle
and
looked
in
she
expected
to
see
her
own
face
in
the
glass
as
usual
but
she
did
not
see
it
instead
there
was
a
black
space
the
opening
to
something
not
quite
black
she
could
see
lights
and
the
space
grew
bigger
or
she
grew
smaller
she
never
knew
which
and
next
moment
she
was
walking
through
the
opening
i
am
going
to
see
something
really
worth
seeing
said
molly
she
was
not
frightened
from
first
to
last
she
was
not
at
all
frightened
she
walked
straight
through
the
back
of
the
cabinet
in
the
best
bedroom
upstairs
into
the
library
on
the
that
sounds
like
nonsense
but
molly
declares
it
was
so
there
were
candles
on
the
table
and
papers
and
there
were
people
in
the
library
they
did
not
see
her
there
was
carruthers
and
aunt
maria
very
pretty
with
long
curls
and
a
striped
gray
silk
dress
like
in
the
picture
in
the
there
was
handsome
jolly
sheldon
in
a
brown
coat
an
old
servant
was
just
going
out
of
the
door
settled
then
said
carruthers
my
girl
bed
aunt
maria
such
a
young
pretty
aunt
maria
molly
would
never
have
known
her
but
for
the
portrait
kissed
her
uncle
and
then
she
took
a
christmas
rose
out
of
her
dress
and
put
it
in
sheldon
buttonhole
and
put
up
her
face
to
him
and
said
james
he
kissed
her
molly
heard
the
loud
jolly
sound
of
the
kiss
and
aunt
maria
went
away
then
the
old
man
said
leave
this
at
bates
for
me
sheldon
you
safer
than
the
post
handsome
sheldon
said
he
would
then
the
lights
went
out
and
molly
was
in
bed
again
quite
suddenly
it
was
daylight
jolly
sheldon
in
his
red
coat
was
standing
by
the
cabinet
the
little
cupboard
door
was
open
george
he
said
ten
days
since
i
promised
to
take
that
will
up
to
bates
and
i
never
gave
it
another
thought
all
your
fault
maria
my
dear
you
should
take
up
all
my
thoughts
take
it
molly
heard
something
click
and
he
went
out
of
the
room
whistling
molly
lay
still
she
felt
there
was
more
to
come
and
the
next
thing
was
that
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
and
saw
something
carried
across
the
lawn
on
a
hurdle
with
two
scarlet
coats
laid
over
it
and
she
knew
it
was
handsome
sheldon
and
that
he
would
not
carry
the
will
to
bates
or
do
anything
else
in
this
world
ever
any
more
when
molly
woke
in
the
morning
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
cabinet
there
was
nothing
in
the
cupboard
all
the
same
she
ran
straight
to
her
aunt
room
it
was
long
before
the
hour
when
clements
soberly
tapped
bringing
hot
water
up
auntie
she
cried
and
auntie
woke
up
very
cross
indeed
here
auntie
she
said
certain
there
a
secret
place
in
that
cabinet
in
my
room
and
the
will
in
it
i
know
it
is
been
dreaming
said
aunt
maria
severely
back
to
bed
you
catch
your
death
of
cold
paddling
about
barefoot
like
that
molly
had
to
go
but
after
breakfast
she
began
again
why
do
you
think
so
asked
aunt
maria
and
molly
who
thought
she
knew
that
nobody
would
believe
her
story
could
only
say
do
know
but
i
am
quite
sure
said
aunt
maria
molly
said
you
think
uncle
might
have
given
the
will
to
sheldon
to
take
to
bates
and
he
may
have
put
it
in
the
secret
place
and
forgotten
a
head
the
child
got
full
of
fancies
said
aunt
maria
he
slept
in
that
room
did
he
ever
sleep
in
that
room
whenever
he
stayed
here
it
long
after
the
that
poor
sheldon
died
days
said
aunt
maria
shortly
away
and
play
i
letters
to
write
but
because
it
seemed
good
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
one
of
those
letters
was
to
a
in
rochester
and
the
groom
took
it
in
the
and
the
came
back
with
him
and
there
a
secret
behind
the
in
the
little
red
lacquered
cupboard
in
the
old
black
and
red
and
gold
cabinet
and
in
that
secret
was
the
missing
will
and
on
it
lay
a
brown
flower
that
dropped
to
dust
when
it
was
moved
a
christmas
rose
said
molly
you
see
really
it
was
a
very
good
thing
the
others
pretended
to
have
measles
because
if
they
had
i
should
have
come
to
you
and
if
i
had
come
i
should
have
known
there
was
a
will
missing
and
if
i
had
known
that
i
should
have
found
it
should
i
aunty
should
i
uncle
said
molly
wild
with
delight
dear
said
aunt
maria
patting
her
hand
girls
said
uncle
toodlethwaite
be
seen
and
not
heard
but
i
admit
that
simulated
measles
may
sometimes
be
a
blessing
in
disguise
all
the
young
carruthers
thought
so
when
they
got
the
five
pounds
that
aunt
maria
sent
them
miss
simpshall
got
five
pounds
too
because
it
was
owing
to
her
that
molly
was
taken
to
the
white
house
that
day
molly
got
a
little
pearl
necklace
as
well
as
five
pounds
sheldon
gave
it
to
me
said
aunt
maria
would
give
it
to
anyone
but
you
molly
hugged
her
in
silent
rapture
that
just
shows
how
different
our
aunt
marias
would
prove
to
be
if
they
would
only
let
us
know
them
as
they
really
are
it
really
is
not
wise
to
conceal
from
children
you
see
if
aunt
maria
had
not
told
molly
about
sheldon
she
would
never
have
thought
about
him
enough
to
see
his
ghost
now
molly
is
grown
up
she
tells
me
it
was
only
a
dream
but
even
if
it
was
it
is
just
as
wonderful
and
served
the
purpose
just
as
well
perhaps
you
would
like
to
know
what
aunt
maria
said
when
the
opened
the
secret
and
she
saw
the
paper
with
the
brown
christmas
rose
on
it
clements
was
there
as
well
as
the
and
molly
she
said
right
out
before
them
all
james
my
dear
and
she
picked
up
the
flower
before
she
opened
the
will
and
it
fell
into
brown
dust
in
her
hand
billy
and
william
a
historical
tale
for
the
young
you
found
your
prize
essay
but
i
have
found
the
bicycle
of
the
butcher
it
is
rather
trying
to
have
to
walk
three
miles
to
the
station
to
say
nothing
of
the
three
miles
back
to
meet
a
cousin
you
have
never
seen
and
never
wish
to
see
especially
if
you
have
to
leave
a
kite
half
made
and
there
is
no
proper
lock
to
the
shed
you
are
making
your
kite
in
the
road
was
flat
and
dusty
the
sun
felt
much
too
warm
on
his
back
the
hill
to
the
station
was
long
and
steep
and
the
train
was
nearly
an
hour
late
because
it
was
a
train
on
the
railway
so
william
was
exceedingly
cross
and
he
would
have
been
crosser
still
if
he
could
have
known
that
i
should
ever
call
him
william
for
though
that
happened
to
be
his
name
the
one
he
to
as
the
advertisements
say
was
so
perhaps
it
would
be
kind
of
me
to
speak
of
him
as
billy
because
it
is
rather
horrid
to
do
things
you
know
people
wo
like
even
if
you
think
they
never
know
you
done
them
well
the
train
came
in
and
it
was
annoying
to
billy
very
that
four
or
five
boys
should
bundle
out
of
the
train
and
he
should
have
to
go
up
to
them
one
after
the
other
and
say
say
is
your
name
harold
st
leger
he
did
not
particularly
like
the
look
of
any
of
the
boys
and
of
course
it
happened
that
the
very
last
one
he
spoke
to
was
harold
and
that
he
was
also
the
one
whom
billy
liked
least
particularly
of
the
whole
lot
you
are
are
you
was
all
he
could
find
to
say
when
harold
had
blushingly
owned
to
his
name
then
in
manly
tones
billy
gave
the
order
about
harold
luggage
and
the
carrier
said
along
and
harold
came
harold
was
a
fattish
boy
with
hair
and
he
was
as
soft
and
white
as
a
silkworm
billy
did
not
admire
him
he
himself
was
hard
and
brown
with
thin
arms
and
legs
and
joints
like
the
lumps
of
clay
on
branches
that
the
gardener
has
grafted
and
harold
did
not
admire
there
was
little
conversation
on
the
way
home
when
you
do
want
to
have
a
visitor
and
he
does
want
to
be
one
talking
is
not
much
fun
when
they
got
home
there
was
tea
billy
mother
talked
politely
to
harold
but
that
did
not
make
anyone
any
happier
then
billy
took
his
cousin
round
and
showed
him
the
farm
and
the
stock
and
harold
was
less
interested
than
you
would
think
a
boy
could
be
at
last
weary
of
trying
to
behave
nicely
billy
said
suppose
there
must
be
you
like
however
much
of
a
muff
you
are
well
you
can
jolly
well
find
it
out
for
yourself
i
going
to
finish
my
kite
the
face
of
harold
lighted
up
can
make
kites
he
said
invented
a
new
kind
i
help
you
if
you
let
me
harold
eager
quick
fingered
skilful
in
the
shed
among
the
string
and
the
glue
and
the
paper
and
the
bendable
breakable
laths
was
quite
a
different
person
from
harold
nervous
and
dull
among
the
farmyard
beasts
billy
allowed
him
to
help
with
the
kite
and
he
began
to
respect
his
cousin
a
little
more
it
rather
like
a
girl
being
so
neat
with
your
fingers
he
said
disparagingly
wish
i
got
the
proper
sort
of
paper
harold
said
i
make
my
new
patent
kite
that
i
invented
but
it
a
very
extra
sort
of
kind
of
paper
i
got
some
once
at
a
in
bermondsey
but
that
was
in
a
dream
billy
stared
must
be
off
your
chump
he
said
and
he
felt
more
sorry
than
ever
that
his
jolly
country
holiday
was
to
be
spoiled
by
a
strange
cousin
who
ought
perhaps
to
be
in
a
lunatic
asylum
rather
than
at
a
respectable
farm
that
night
billy
was
awakened
from
the
dreamless
sleep
which
blesses
the
sort
of
boy
he
was
to
find
harold
excitedly
thumping
him
on
the
back
with
a
roll
of
stiff
paper
up
he
said
up
i
tell
somebody
that
awake
i
dreamed
that
a
jackdaw
came
in
and
flew
off
with
that
thin
paper
thing
that
was
on
the
chest
of
drawers
with
the
gilt
button
at
the
corner
and
then
i
dreamed
i
got
up
and
found
this
roll
of
paper
up
the
chimney
and
when
i
woke
up
i
found
had
and
had
and
it
the
real
right
for
my
patent
kite
just
like
i
dreamed
i
bought
in
the
in
bermondsey
and
it
five
by
the
church
clock
and
it
quite
light
i
going
to
get
up
directly
minute
and
make
my
patent
kite
fiddlestick
replied
billy
sleepy
and
indignant
get
along
and
leave
me
be
you
been
dreaming
that
all
just
like
a
girl
repeated
harold
gently
been
dreaming
but
when
i
woke
up
i
found
had
and
had
and
here
the
paper
and
the
flimsy
thing
with
the
gold
stud
you
get
up
and
see
billy
did
he
got
up
with
a
bound
and
he
saw
with
an
eye
and
william
turned
on
harold
and
shook
him
till
his
teeth
nearly
rattled
in
his
head
and
his
pale
eyes
nearly
dropped
out
i
have
called
him
william
here
because
i
really
think
he
deserves
it
it
is
a
cowardly
thing
to
shake
a
cousin
even
if
you
do
not
happen
to
be
pleased
with
him
wha
what
the
matter
choked
the
wretched
harold
you
miserable
little
idiot
you
been
dreaming
at
all
you
been
lying
like
a
silly
log
and
letting
that
beastly
bird
carry
off
my
prize
essay
that
and
it
took
me
ten
days
to
do
and
i
had
to
get
almost
all
of
it
out
of
books
and
the
worse
swat
i
ever
did
in
my
life
and
now
it
all
no
good
and
there
are
any
books
down
here
to
do
it
again
out
of
oh
bother
bother
very
sorry
for
you
said
harold
i
did
lie
like
logs
i
did
dream
and
i
got
the
and
i
help
you
write
the
essay
again
if
you
like
should
be
surprised
if
it
was
all
a
said
william
i
go
on
calling
him
william
at
present
hidden
the
essay
so
as
to
be
able
to
send
it
in
yourself
how
you
said
harold
and
he
turned
pale
just
like
a
girl
and
just
like
a
girl
he
began
to
cry
look
here
the
enraged
william
went
on
got
to
be
civil
to
you
before
people
but
do
you
dare
to
speak
to
me
when
we
alone
you
either
a
silly
idiot
or
a
sneaking
hound
and
either
way
i
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
i
do
know
how
he
could
have
done
it
but
william
kept
his
word
and
for
three
days
he
only
spoke
to
harold
when
other
people
were
about
this
was
horrible
for
harold
he
had
been
used
to
being
his
pride
and
his
mother
joy
and
now
he
was
nobody
anything
which
is
the
saddest
thing
in
the
world
to
be
he
tried
to
console
himself
by
making
kites
all
day
long
but
even
kites
can
not
comfort
you
when
nobody
loves
you
and
when
you
feel
that
it
really
is
not
your
fault
at
all
william
went
about
his
own
affairs
he
was
not
at
all
happy
he
finished
his
kite
and
flew
it
and
he
lost
it
because
the
string
caught
on
the
church
which
cut
it
in
two
and
he
tried
to
rewrite
his
prize
essay
but
he
could
because
he
had
taken
all
the
stuffing
for
it
out
of
books
and
not
out
of
his
head
where
it
ought
to
have
been
harold
found
some
moments
of
forgetfulness
when
he
was
making
the
patent
kite
it
was
very
big
and
the
roll
of
paper
he
had
found
in
his
dream
in
the
chimney
was
exactly
the
right
thing
for
patent
but
when
it
was
done
what
was
the
good
there
was
no
one
to
see
him
fly
it
he
did
fly
it
and
it
was
perfect
it
was
shaped
like
a
bird
and
it
rose
up
and
up
and
up
and
hung
poised
above
the
light
and
steady
as
a
hawk
poised
above
its
prey
william
would
even
come
out
to
look
at
it
though
harold
begged
him
to
the
next
morning
harold
dreamed
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
bear
things
any
longer
and
had
run
away
and
when
william
woke
up
harold
was
gone
then
william
remembered
how
harold
had
offered
to
help
him
with
his
kite
and
would
have
helped
him
to
rewrite
the
essay
and
how
through
those
three
cruel
days
harold
had
again
and
again
tried
to
make
friends
and
how
after
all
he
was
with
his
own
people
and
harold
was
a
stranger
he
said
bother
i
wish
i
had
and
he
felt
that
he
had
been
a
beast
this
is
called
remorse
then
he
said
find
him
and
i
be
as
decent
to
him
as
i
can
poor
chap
though
he
silly
this
is
called
repentance
then
he
found
a
letter
on
harold
bed
it
said
and
it
was
blotted
with
tears
and
it
had
a
blob
of
glue
on
it
billy
was
my
fault
about
your
essay
and
i
sorry
and
am
going
to
run
away
to
india
to
find
my
people
i
shall
go
disguised
as
a
stowaway
affectionate
cousin
egbert
darwin
st
leger
billy
did
not
have
to
show
this
letter
to
his
mother
because
she
had
gone
away
for
the
day
so
he
did
not
have
to
explain
to
her
what
a
beast
he
had
been
if
he
had
had
to
do
this
it
would
have
been
part
of
what
is
called
expiation
then
he
got
the
farm
men
to
go
out
in
every
direction
furnished
with
a
full
description
of
harold
appearance
and
billy
borrowed
a
bicycle
from
a
butcher
boy
in
the
village
and
set
out
for
plymouth
because
that
seemed
the
likeliest
place
to
look
in
for
a
cousin
who
was
running
away
disguised
as
a
stowaway
the
wind
blew
straight
towards
the
sea
and
it
occurred
to
billy
he
deserves
to
be
called
billy
now
i
think
that
the
great
patent
kite
which
was
ten
feet
high
would
drag
him
along
like
winking
if
he
could
only
set
it
flying
and
then
tie
it
to
the
of
the
bicycle
it
was
rather
a
ticklish
business
to
get
the
kite
up
but
the
butcher
boy
helped
he
had
a
noble
heart
and
at
last
it
was
done
billy
saw
the
great
flying
off
towards
plymouth
he
hastily
knotted
the
string
to
the
bicycle
handle
held
the
slack
of
it
in
his
hand
mounted
started
paid
out
the
slack
of
the
string
and
the
next
moment
the
string
was
tight
and
the
kite
was
pulling
billy
and
the
bicycle
along
the
plymouth
road
at
the
rate
of
many
miles
an
hour
at
last
he
came
to
the
outskirts
of
plymouth
i
shall
not
tell
you
what
plymouth
was
like
because
billy
did
not
notice
or
know
at
all
what
it
was
like
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
plymouth
seemed
to
billy
very
much
like
other
places
the
only
odd
thing
was
that
he
could
not
stop
his
bicycle
though
he
pulled
in
the
kite
string
as
hard
as
he
could
he
flew
through
the
town
all
the
traffic
stopped
to
let
him
steer
his
machine
through
the
streets
and
tradespeople
and
people
walking
on
business
and
people
walking
for
pleasure
all
stopped
with
their
respectable
mouths
wide
open
to
stare
at
billy
on
his
bicycle
and
the
kite
pulled
the
machine
on
and
on
without
pause
and
at
a
furious
rate
and
billy
in
despair
was
just
feeling
in
his
pocket
for
his
knife
to
cut
the
string
when
some
mighty
seemed
to
catch
the
kite
and
it
gave
a
leap
and
went
twenty
times
as
fast
as
it
had
gone
before
and
the
bicycle
had
to
go
twenty
times
as
fast
too
and
before
billy
could
say
robinson
or
even
for
short
the
kite
rushed
wildly
out
to
sea
dragging
the
bicycle
after
it
right
slap
off
the
edge
of
england
so
billy
and
the
butcher
boy
bicycle
were
dragged
into
the
sea
not
at
all
they
were
dragged
to
the
sea
which
is
not
at
all
the
same
sort
of
thing
for
the
kite
was
such
a
very
extra
patent
one
and
so
perfectly
designed
and
made
that
it
was
just
strong
enough
to
bear
the
weight
of
billy
and
the
bicycle
and
to
keep
them
out
of
the
water
so
that
billy
found
himself
riding
splendidly
over
the
waves
and
there
was
no
more
splashing
than
there
would
have
been
on
the
road
on
a
very
muddy
day
luckily
the
sea
was
smooth
or
i
do
know
what
would
have
happened
it
was
smooth
and
and
the
sun
made
diamond
sparkles
on
it
and
billy
felt
as
grand
as
grand
to
be
riding
over
such
a
glorious
floor
it
was
a
fine
time
but
rather
an
anxious
one
too
because
suppose
the
string
had
not
held
no
one
could
possibly
ride
a
bicycle
on
the
sea
unless
they
had
the
really
only
truly
right
sort
of
kite
to
hold
the
machine
up
away
and
away
went
the
kite
through
the
blue
air
up
above
and
away
and
away
went
the
bicycle
over
the
greeny
foamy
sea
down
below
and
away
and
away
went
billy
and
the
kite
went
faster
and
faster
and
faster
and
faster
went
the
bicycle
much
much
faster
than
you
would
believe
unless
you
had
seen
it
as
billy
did
and
just
at
the
of
the
bay
of
biscay
the
bicycle
caught
up
with
a
and
steamer
and
the
kite
followed
the
course
of
the
ship
and
went
alongside
of
it
so
you
can
guess
how
fast
the
bicycle
was
going
and
the
captain
of
the
ship
hailed
billy
through
a
and
said
there
billy
replied
yourself
but
the
captain
could
hear
him
so
the
captain
said
something
that
billy
could
hear
either
but
the
people
who
were
meant
to
hear
heard
and
the
great
ship
stopped
and
billy
rode
close
up
to
it
and
they
hauled
him
up
by
the
string
of
the
kite
and
they
put
the
bicycle
in
a
safe
place
and
tied
the
string
to
the
mast
and
then
the
captain
said
suppose
i
dreaming
you
boy
because
what
you
doing
is
impossible
know
it
is
said
billy
i
doing
it
at
least
i
was
till
you
stopped
me
they
were
both
wrong
because
of
course
if
it
had
been
impossible
billy
could
not
have
done
it
but
neither
of
them
had
a
scientific
mind
as
you
and
i
have
dear
reader
so
the
captain
asked
billy
to
dinner
which
was
very
nice
only
there
was
an
uncertain
feeling
about
it
and
when
billy
had
had
dinner
he
said
to
the
captain
must
be
going
there
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
said
the
captain
do
know
said
billy
you
happen
to
have
a
boy
named
harold
egbert
darwin
leger
on
board
he
said
he
was
going
away
in
a
ship
to
india
disguised
as
a
stowaway
the
captain
at
once
ordered
the
ship
to
be
searched
for
a
boy
of
this
name
in
this
disguise
the
crew
looked
in
the
hold
and
in
the
galley
and
in
the
foretop
and
on
the
quarter
and
in
the
gaff
and
the
jib
and
the
topsail
and
the
boom
but
they
could
not
find
harold
they
ransacked
the
and
the
and
the
bowsprit
they
explored
the
backstays
the
stays
and
the
waist
but
they
found
no
stowaway
they
examined
truck
and
block
they
hunted
through
every
porthole
they
left
not
an
inch
of
the
ribs
unexplored
but
no
harold
he
was
not
in
any
of
the
or
nor
was
he
hidden
in
the
capstan
or
the
compass
at
last
in
despair
the
captain
thought
of
looking
in
the
cabins
and
in
one
of
them
hidden
under
the
scattered
pyjamas
and
embroidered
socks
of
a
major
of
artillery
they
found
harold
he
and
billy
explained
everything
to
each
other
and
shook
hands
and
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
ship
did
you
ever
see
a
dry
eye
i
think
it
would
look
rather
nasty
then
said
billy
to
harold
is
all
very
well
but
how
am
i
to
get
you
home
can
ride
on
the
step
of
the
bike
said
harold
the
wind
wo
take
us
back
said
billy
dead
against
us
me
said
the
captain
in
a
manly
manner
know
that
britannia
rules
the
waves
and
controls
the
elements
allow
me
one
moment
he
sent
for
the
boatswain
and
bade
him
whistle
for
a
wind
expressly
stating
what
kind
of
wind
was
needed
and
everyone
saw
with
delight
but
with
little
surprise
the
kite
deliberately
turn
round
and
retrace
its
steps
towards
the
cliffs
of
albion
illustration
bicycle
started
billy
in
the
saddle
and
harold
on
the
step
page
a
cheer
rose
from
passengers
and
crew
alike
as
the
bicycle
was
lowered
to
the
waves
the
string
tightened
and
the
bicycle
started
billy
in
the
saddle
and
harold
on
the
step
the
event
was
a
perfect
windfall
to
the
passengers
it
gave
them
something
to
talk
of
all
the
way
to
suez
some
of
them
are
talking
about
it
still
the
kite
went
back
even
faster
than
it
had
come
it
pulled
the
bicycle
behind
it
as
easily
as
a
child
pulls
a
along
the
floor
by
a
bit
of
thread
so
that
harold
and
billy
were
home
by
and
it
was
the
jolliest
meal
either
of
them
had
ever
had
they
had
determined
to
stop
the
bicycle
by
cutting
the
string
and
then
harold
would
have
lost
the
patent
kite
which
would
have
been
a
pity
but
most
happily
the
string
of
the
kite
caught
in
the
vane
on
the
top
of
the
church
tower
and
the
bicycle
stopped
by
itself
exactly
opposite
the
butcher
boy
to
whom
it
belonged
he
had
a
noble
heart
and
he
was
very
glad
to
see
his
bicycle
again
after
tea
the
boys
went
up
the
church
tower
to
get
the
kite
and
i
suppose
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
there
in
the
niche
of
a
window
of
the
belfry
was
a
jackdaw
nest
and
in
it
the
historical
essay
which
the
jackdaw
had
stolen
as
you
will
have
guessed
for
the
sake
of
the
bright
gilt
manuscript
fastener
in
the
corner
and
now
harold
and
billy
became
really
chums
in
spite
of
all
the
qualities
which
they
could
not
help
disliking
in
each
other
each
found
some
things
in
the
other
that
he
did
dislike
so
very
much
after
all
when
harold
grows
up
he
will
sell
many
patent
kites
and
we
shall
all
be
able
to
ride
bicycles
on
the
sea
billy
sent
in
his
essay
but
he
did
not
get
the
prize
so
it
have
mattered
if
it
had
never
been
found
only
i
am
glad
it
was
found
i
hope
you
will
not
think
that
this
is
a
story
it
is
very
nearly
as
true
as
any
of
the
history
in
billy
essay
that
did
get
a
prize
the
only
thing
i
ca
quite
believe
myself
is
about
the
roll
of
the
right
kind
of
paper
being
in
the
chimney
but
harold
could
think
of
anything
else
to
dream
about
and
the
most
fortunate
accidents
do
happen
sometimes
even
in
stories
the
twopenny
spell
lucy
was
a
very
good
little
girl
indeed
and
harry
was
not
so
bad
for
a
boy
though
the
called
him
a
limb
they
both
got
on
very
well
at
school
and
were
not
wholly
unloved
at
home
perhaps
lucy
was
a
bit
of
a
muff
and
harry
was
certainly
very
rude
to
call
her
one
but
she
need
not
have
replied
by
calling
him
a
i
think
she
did
it
partly
to
show
him
that
she
was
not
quite
so
much
of
a
muff
as
he
thought
and
partly
because
she
was
naturally
annoyed
at
being
buried
up
to
her
waist
in
the
ground
among
the
she
got
into
the
hole
harry
had
dug
because
he
said
it
might
make
her
grow
and
then
he
suddenly
shovelled
down
a
heap
of
earth
and
stamped
it
down
so
that
she
could
not
move
she
began
to
cry
then
he
said
and
she
said
and
he
went
away
and
left
her
there
as
the
french
people
say
and
she
cried
more
than
ever
and
tried
to
dig
herself
out
and
could
and
although
she
was
naturally
such
a
gentle
child
she
would
have
stamped
with
rage
only
she
could
get
her
feet
out
to
do
it
then
she
screamed
and
her
uncle
richard
came
and
dug
her
out
and
said
it
was
a
shame
and
gave
her
twopence
to
spend
as
she
liked
so
she
got
nurse
to
clean
the
gooseberry
ground
off
her
and
when
she
was
cleaned
she
went
out
to
spend
the
twopence
she
was
allowed
to
go
alone
because
the
shops
were
only
a
little
way
off
on
the
same
side
of
the
road
so
there
was
no
danger
from
crossings
spend
every
penny
of
it
on
myself
said
lucy
savagely
sha
have
a
bit
unless
i
could
think
of
something
he
would
like
and
then
i
get
it
and
put
it
in
his
bread
and
milk
she
had
never
felt
quite
so
spiteful
before
but
then
harry
had
never
before
been
quite
so
aggravating
she
walked
slowly
along
by
the
shops
wishing
she
could
think
of
something
that
harry
hated
she
herself
hated
worms
but
harry
mind
them
boys
are
so
odd
suddenly
she
saw
a
shop
she
had
never
noticed
before
the
window
was
quite
full
of
flowers
roses
lilies
violets
pinks
pansies
everything
you
can
think
of
growing
in
a
tangled
heap
as
you
see
them
in
an
old
garden
in
july
she
looked
for
the
name
over
the
shop
instead
of
being
somebody
or
other
florist
it
was
de
lara
professor
of
white
and
black
magic
and
in
the
window
was
a
large
card
framed
and
glazed
it
said
enchantments
done
while
you
wait
every
description
of
charm
carefully
and
competently
worked
strong
spells
from
fifty
guineas
to
tuppence
we
suit
all
purses
give
us
a
trial
best
and
cheapest
house
in
the
trade
competition
defied
lucy
read
this
with
her
thumb
in
her
mouth
it
was
the
tuppence
that
attracted
her
she
had
never
bought
a
spell
and
even
a
tuppenny
one
would
be
something
new
some
sort
of
conjuring
trick
i
suppose
she
thought
never
let
harry
see
how
it
done
never
never
never
she
went
in
the
shop
was
just
as
flowery
and
bowery
and
and
inside
as
out
and
the
colour
and
the
scent
almost
took
her
breath
away
a
thin
dark
unpleasing
gentleman
suddenly
popped
out
of
a
bower
of
flowering
nightshade
and
said
what
can
we
do
for
you
miss

spell

lucy

said
lucy

much
of

he
it
better

lucy

a
guilty

the
dark
gentleman

the
coppers

because

very
much
astonished

a
warning

had
turned
into
the
that
she
knew

well

nasty
doloro
had
turned
into
the
who
was
asking
what
she
wanted
to
which
of
course
as
she
had
spent
her
twopence
the
answer
was
she
was
already
sorry
that
she
had
spent
it
and
in
such
a
way
and
she
was
sorrier
still
when
she
got
home
and
harry
owned
handsomely
that
was
sorry
he
had
planted
her
out
but
he
really
had
thought
she
was
such
a
little
idiot
and
he
sorry
so
there
this
touched
lucy
heart
and
she
felt
more
than
ever
that
she
had
not
laid
out
her
tuppence
to
the
best
advantage
she
tried
to
warn
harry
of
what
was
to
happen
in
the
morning
but
he
only
said
yarn
billson
minor
coming
for
cricket
you
can
field
if
you
like
lucy
did
like
but
it
seemed
the
only
thing
she
could
do
to
show
that
she
accepted
in
a
proper
spirit
her
brother
apology
about
the
planting
out
so
she
fielded
gloomily
and
ineffectively
next
morning
harry
got
up
in
good
time
folded
up
his
nightshirt
and
made
his
room
so
tidy
that
the
housemaid
nearly
had
a
when
she
went
in
he
crept
downstairs
like
a
mouse
and
learned
his
lessons
before
breakfast
lucy
on
the
other
hand
got
up
so
late
that
it
was
only
by
dressing
hastily
that
she
had
time
to
prepare
a
thoroughly
good
before
she
slid
down
the
banisters
just
as
the
rang
she
was
first
in
the
room
so
she
was
able
to
put
a
little
salt
in
all
the
before
anyone
else
came
in
fresh
tea
was
made
and
harry
was
blamed
lucy
said
did
it
but
no
one
believed
her
they
said
she
was
a
noble
unselfish
sister
to
try
and
shield
her
naughty
brother
and
harry
burst
into
floods
of
tears
when
she
kicked
him
under
the
table
she
hated
herself
for
doing
this
but
somehow
it
seemed
impossible
to
do
anything
else
harry
cried
nearly
all
the
way
to
school
while
lucy
insisted
on
sliding
along
all
the
gutters
and
dragging
harry
after
her
she
bought
a
catapult
at
the
and
a
pennyworth
of
tintacks
at
the
both
on
credit
and
as
lucy
had
never
asked
for
credit
before
she
got
it
at
the
top
of
blackheath
village
they
separated
harry
went
back
to
his
school
which
is
at
the
other
side
of
the
station
and
lucy
went
on
to
the
high
school
the
blackheath
high
school
has
a
large
and
beautiful
hall
with
a
staircase
leading
down
into
it
like
a
staircase
in
a
picture
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
is
a
big
statue
of
a
beautiful
lady
the
high
school
mistresses
call
her
venus
but
i
do
really
believe
that
is
her
name
lucy
good
gentle
little
lucy
beloved
by
her
form
mistress
and
respected
by
all
the
school
sat
on
those
steps
i
do
know
why
no
one
caught
her
and
used
her
catapult
to
throw
ink
pellets
you
know
what
they
are
of
course
with
her
catapult
at
the
beautiful
white
till
the
venus
if
that
is
her
name
which
i
doubt
was
all
over
black
spots
like
a
dalmation
or
carriage
dog
then
she
went
into
her
class
room
and
arranged
tintacks
with
the
business
end
up
on
all
the
desks
and
seats
an
act
fraught
with
gloomy
returns
to
blossoma
rand
and
wilhelmina
marguerite
asterisk
another
a
dictionary
a
pot
of
water
three
pieces
of
chalk
and
a
handful
of
torn
paper
was
hastily
sketched
above
the
door
three
other
little
girls
looked
on
in
appreciation
i
do
not
wish
to
shock
you
so
i
will
not
tell
you
about
the
complete
success
of
the
nor
of
the
bloodthirsty
fight
between
lucy
and
bertha
kaurter
in
a
secluded
during
rec
dora
spielman
and
gertrude
rook
were
agitated
seconds
it
was
lucy
form
mistress
the
adored
miss
harter
larke
who
interrupted
the
fight
at
the
fifth
round
and
led
the
culprits
into
the
hall
and
up
the
beautiful
steps
to
the
headmistress
room
the
head
of
the
blackheath
high
school
has
all
the
subtle
generalship
of
the
head
in
kipling
she
has
also
a
manner
which
subdues
parents
and
children
alike
to
she
works
in
like
the
dyer
hand
anyone
less
clever
would
have
expelled
the
luckless
lucy
saddled
with
her
brother
on
such
evidence
as
was
now
brought
forward
not
so
the
blackheath
head
she
reserved
judgment
the
most
terrible
of
all
things
for
a
culprit
by
the
way
who
thought
it
over
for
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
mistress
room
and
she
privately
wrote
a
note
to
lucy
mother
gently
hinting
that
lucy
was
not
quite
herself
might
be
sickening
for
something
perhaps
she
had
better
be
kept
at
home
for
a
day
or
two
lucy
went
home
and
on
the
way
upset
a
bicycle
with
a
little
girl
on
it
and
came
off
best
in
a
heated
physical
argument
with
a
baker
boy
harry
meanwhile
had
dried
his
tears
and
gone
to
school
he
knew
his
lessons
which
was
a
strange
and
pleasing
thing
and
roused
in
his
master
hopes
destined
to
be
firmly
and
thoroughly
crushed
in
the
near
future
but
when
he
had
emerged
triumphantly
from
morning
school
he
suddenly
found
his
head
being
punched
by
simpkins
minor
on
the
ground
that
he
harry
had
been
showing
off
the
punching
was
scientific
and
irresistible
harry
indeed
did
not
try
to
resist
in
floods
of
tears
and
with
uncontrolled
emotion
he
implored
simpkins
minor
to
let
him
alone
and
not
be
a
brute
then
simpkins
minor
kicked
him
and
several
other
nice
little
of
his
joined
the
glad
throng
and
it
became
quite
a
kicking
party
so
that
when
harry
and
lucy
met
at
the
corner
of
wemyss
road
his
face
was
almost
unrecognisable
while
lucy
looked
as
happy
as
a
king
and
as
proud
as
a
peacock
up
asked
lucy
briskly
single
boy
in
the
school
has
kicked
me
said
harry
in
flat
accents
wish
i
was
dead
do
i
said
lucy
cheerily
think
i
going
to
be
expelled
i
should
be
quite
certain
only
my
came
down
on
bessie
head
instead
of
miss
whatshername
and
bessie
no
sneak
though
she
has
got
a
lump
like
an
ostrich
egg
on
her
forehead
and
soaked
through
as
well
but
i
think
i
certain
to
be
expelled
wish
i
was
said
harry
weeping
with
heartfelt
emotion
know
what
the
matter
with
me
i
feel
all
wrong
inside
do
you
think
you
can
turn
into
things
just
by
reading
them
because
i
feel
as
if
i
was
in
sandford
and
merton
or
one
of
the
books
the
kind
clergyman
lent
us
at
the
seaside
awfully
beastly
said
lucy
i
feel
as
if
i
did
care
tuppence
whether
i
was
expelled
or
not
and
i
say
harry
i
feel
as
if
i
was
much
stronger
than
you
i
know
i
could
twist
your
arm
round
and
then
hit
it
like
you
did
me
the
other
day
and
you
could
stop
me
course
i
could
ca
stop
anybody
doing
anything
they
want
to
do
anybody
who
likes
can
hit
me
and
i
ca
hit
back
he
began
to
cry
again
and
suddenly
lucy
was
really
sorry
she
had
done
this
she
had
degraded
her
happy
brother
to
a
mere
milksop
just
because
he
had
happened
to
plant
her
out
and
leave
her
planted
remorse
suddenly
gripped
her
with
tooth
and
claw
here
she
said
all
my
fault
because
you
planted
me
out
and
i
wanted
to
hurt
you
but
now
i
do
i
ca
make
you
again
but
i
sorry
and
i
look
after
you
harry
old
man
perhaps
you
could
disguise
yourself
in
frocks
and
long
hair
and
come
to
the
high
school
i
take
care
nobody
bullied
you
it
is
nice
being
bullied
is
it
harry
flung
his
arms
round
her
a
thing
he
would
never
have
done
in
the
public
street
if
he
had
not
been
girlish
inside
at
the
time
it
hateful
he
said
i
sorry
i
been
such
a
pig
to
you
lucy
put
her
arms
round
him
and
they
kissed
each
other
though
it
was
broad
daylight
and
they
were
walking
down
lee
park
the
same
moment
the
enchanter
doloro
de
lara
ran
into
them
on
the
pavement
lucy
screamed
and
harry
hit
out
as
hard
as
he
could
out
said
he
are
you
shoving
into
said
the
enchanter
putting
his
hat
straight
bust
up
your
spell
my
lucy
child
no
spells
hold
if
you
go
kissing
and
saying
you
sorry
just
keep
that
in
mind
for
the
future
will
you
he
vanished
in
the
white
cloud
of
a
passing
and
harry
and
lucy
were
left
looking
at
each
other
and
harry
was
harry
and
lucy
was
lucy
to
the
very
marrow
of
their
little
they
shook
hands
with
earnest
feeling
next
day
lucy
went
to
the
high
school
and
apologised
in
dust
and
ashes
do
think
i
was
my
right
self
she
said
to
the
headmistress
who
quite
agreed
with
her
i
never
will
again
and
she
never
has
harry
on
the
other
hand
thrashed
simpkins
minor
thoroughly
and
scientifically
on
the
first
opportunity
but
he
did
not
thrash
him
extravagantly
he
tempered
pluck
with
mercy
for
this
is
the
odd
thing
about
the
whole
story
ever
since
the
day
when
the
tuppenny
spell
did
its
work
harry
has
been
kinder
than
before
and
lucy
braver
i
ca
think
why
but
so
it
is
he
no
longer
bullies
her
and
she
is
no
longer
afraid
of
him
and
every
time
she
does
something
brave
for
him
or
he
does
something
kind
for
her
they
grow
more
and
more
alike
so
that
when
they
are
grown
up
he
may
as
well
be
called
lucius
and
she
harriett
for
all
the
difference
there
will
be
between
them
and
all
the
look
on
and
admire
and
think
that
their
incessant
jawing
has
produced
this
improvement
and
no
one
suspects
the
truth
except
the
headmistress
of
the
high
school
who
has
gone
through
the
complete
course
of
social
magic
under
a
better
professor
than
doloro
de
lara
that
is
why
she
understands
everything
and
why
she
did
not
expel
lucy
but
only
admonished
her
harry
is
cock
of
his
school
now
and
lucy
is
in
the
sixth
and
a
model
girl
i
wish
all
headmistresses
learned
magic
at
girton
showing
off
or
the
boy
his
parents
had
thoughtlessly
christened
him
hildebrand
a
name
which
as
you
see
is
entirely
unsuitable
for
school
use
his
friends
called
him
brandy
and
that
was
bad
enough
though
it
had
a
sort
of
sound
too
but
the
boys
who
did
not
like
him
called
him
hilda
and
this
was
indeed
hard
to
bear
in
vain
he
told
them
that
his
name
was
james
as
well
it
was
not
true
and
they
would
not
have
believed
it
if
it
had
been
he
had
not
many
friends
because
he
was
not
a
very
nice
boy
he
was
not
very
brave
except
when
he
was
in
a
rage
which
is
a
poor
sort
of
courage
anyhow
and
when
the
boys
used
to
call
him
and
other
unpleasing
names
he
used
to
try
to
show
off
to
them
and
make
them
admire
him
by
telling
them
stories
of
the
wild
boars
he
had
killed
and
the
red
indians
he
had
fought
and
of
how
he
had
been
down
niagara
in
an
open
boat
and
been
shipwrecked
on
the
high
seas
they
were
not
bad
stories
and
the
boys
would
not
have
minded
listening
to
them
but
hildebrand
wanted
to
have
his
stories
not
only
listened
to
but
believed
which
is
quite
another
pair
of
shoes
he
had
one
friend
who
always
liked
his
stories
and
believed
them
almost
all
this
was
his
little
sister
but
he
was
simply
horrid
to
her
he
never
would
lend
her
a
any
of
his
toys
and
he
called
her
which
she
hated
instead
of
ethel
which
happened
to
be
her
name
all
this
is
rather
dull
and
exactly
like
many
boys
of
your
acquaintance
no
doubt
but
what
happened
to
hildebrand
does
not
fortunately
or
unfortunately
happen
to
everybody
i
dare
say
it
has
never
happened
to
you
it
began
on
the
day
when
hildebrand
was
making
a
catapult
and
billson
minor
came
up
to
him
in
the
playground
and
said
use
it
be
to
you
when
you
made
it
you
ca
hit
a
haystack
a
yard
off
i
said
hildebrand
just
see
i
hit
a
swallow
on
the
wing
last
summer
and
when
we
had
a
house
in
thibet
i
shot
a
llama
dead
with
one
bullet
he
was
feet
long
billson
laughed
and
asked
a
boy
who
was
passing
if
he
ever
been
out
and
if
so
what
his
bag
was
the
other
boy
said
i
see
little
hilda
gassing
again
billson
said
lying
i
call
it
yourself
said
hildebrand
who
was
now
so
angry
that
his
fingers
trembled
too
much
for
him
to
be
able
to
go
on
splicing
the
catapult
run
away
and
play
said
billson
wearily
home
to
nurse
hilda
darling
and
tell
her
to
put
your
hair
in
then
hildebrand
rage
turned
into
a
sort
of
courage
and
he
hit
out
at
billson
who
of
course
hit
back
and
there
was
a
fight
the
other
boy
held
their
coats
and
saw
fair
and
hildebrand
was
badly
beaten
because
billson
was
older
and
bigger
and
a
better
fighter
so
he
went
home
crying
with
fury
and
pain
he
went
up
into
his
own
bedroom
and
bolted
the
door
and
wildly
wished
that
he
was
a
red
indian
and
that
taking
scalps
was
not
forbidden
in
clapham
billson
he
reflected
gloomily
would
have
been
a
scalp
and
a
nice
beginning
to
a
presently
he
stopped
crying
and
let
his
little
sister
in
she
had
been
crying
too
outside
the
door
ever
since
he
came
home
and
pushed
past
her
on
the
stairs
she
pitied
his
bruised
face
and
said
it
was
a
shame
of
billson
minor
to
hit
a
boy
littler
than
he
was
not
so
very
little
said
hildebrand
you
know
how
brave
i
am
why
it
was
only
last
week
that
i
was
the
chief
of
the
mighty
tribe
of
moccasins
who
waged
war
against
bill
billson
the
redskin
he
told
the
story
to
its
gory
end
and
ethel
liked
it
very
much
and
hoped
it
was
wrong
to
make
up
such
things
she
could
quite
believe
it
all
then
she
went
down
and
hildebrand
had
to
wash
his
face
for
dinner
and
when
he
looked
at
the
boy
in
the
and
saw
the
black
eye
billson
minor
had
given
him
and
the
cut
lip
from
the
same
giver
he
clenched
his
fist
and
said
wish
i
could
make
things
true
by
saying
them
would
i
bung
up
old
billson
peepers
that
all
you
can
if
you
like
said
the
boy
in
the
glass
whom
hildebrand
had
thought
was
his
own
reflection
said
he
with
his
mouth
open
he
was
horribly
startled
can
if
you
like
said
the
boy
again
give
you
your
wish
will
you
have
it
this
a
asked
hildebrand
cautiously
said
the
boy
hildebrand
had
never
expected
to
be
allowed
to
take
part
in
a
and
at
first
he
could
hardly
believe
in
such
luck
you
mean
to
say
he
said
if
i
say
i
found
a
pot
of
gold
in
the
garden
yesterday
i
did
find
a
pot
of
gold
you
find
it
the
thing
works
backwards
you
see
like
all
things
you
know
your
alice
i
suppose
there
only
one
condition
you
wo
be
able
to
see
yourself
in
the
any
more
wants
to
said
hildebrand
things
you
say
to
do
count
always
ethel
said
ethel
brother
accept
then
said
the
boy
in
the
glass
and
with
that
the
boy
vanished
and
hildebrand
was
left
staring
at
the
mirror
which
now
reflected
only
the
and
the
chest
of
drawers
and
part
of
the
picture
of
lord
roberts
pinned
against
the
wall
you
have
no
idea
how
odd
and
unpleasant
it
is
to
look
at
a
glass
and
see
everything
reflected
as
usual
except
yourself
though
you
are
right
in
front
of
it
hildebrand
felt
as
if
he
must
have
vanished
as
well
as
the
boy
but
he
was
reassured
when
he
looked
down
at
his
hands
they
were
still
there
and
still
extremely
dirty
the
second
bell
had
rung
and
he
washed
them
hastily
and
went
down
untidy
your
hair
is
said
his
mother
oh
hildebrand
what
a
disagreeable
expression
dear
and
look
at
your
eye
you
been
fighting
again
could
help
it
said
our
hero
sulkily
called
names
anyway
i
gave
him
an
awful
licking
he
worse
than
i
am
potatoes
please
next
day
hildebrand
had
forgotten
the
words
he
had
said
at
dinner
and
when
billson
asked
him
if
one
licking
was
enough
and
whether
he
billson
was
a
liar
or
not
hildebrand
said
can
lick
me
and
make
me
anything
you
like
but
you
all
the
same
just
as
much
as
me
and
he
began
to
cry
and
billson
called
him
schoolgirl
and
slapped
his
face
because
billson
knew
nothing
of
the
promise
of
the
boy
that
whatever
hildebrand
said
had
happened
should
happen
it
was
a
dreadful
fight
and
when
it
was
over
hildebrand
could
hardly
walk
home
he
was
much
more
hurt
than
he
had
been
the
day
before
but
billson
minor
had
to
be
carried
home
only
he
was
all
right
again
next
day
and
hildebrand
was
so
he
did
not
get
much
out
of
this
affair
except
glory
and
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
billson
and
the
other
boys
would
now
be
jolly
careful
how
they
called
him
anything
but
pilkings
which
was
his
father
and
his
mother
name
and
therefore
his
as
well
he
had
to
stay
in
bed
the
next
day
and
his
father
punished
him
for
fighting
so
he
consoled
himself
by
telling
ethel
how
he
had
found
a
pot
of
gold
in
the
cellar
the
day
before
after
digging
in
the
hard
earth
for
hours
till
his
hands
were
all
bleeding
and
how
he
had
hidden
it
under
his
bed
let
me
see
hildy
dear
she
said
trying
hard
to
believe
him
but
he
said
not
till
next
day
he
was
well
enough
to
go
to
school
but
he
thought
he
would
just
take
some
and
have
a
look
at
the
cellar
and
see
if
it
was
really
likely
that
there
was
any
gold
there
it
did
not
seem
probable
but
he
thought
he
would
try
and
he
did
it
was
terribly
hard
work
for
he
had
no
tools
but
a
spade
he
had
had
at
the
seaside
and
when
that
broke
as
it
did
almost
at
once
he
had
to
go
on
with
a
piece
of
and
the
foot
of
an
old
bedstead
he
went
on
till
long
past
and
his
hands
were
torn
and
bleeding
his
back
felt
broken
in
two
and
his
head
was
spinning
with
hunger
and
tiredness
at
last
just
as
the
rang
he
reached
his
hand
down
deep
into
the
hole
he
had
made
and
felt
something
cold
and
round
he
held
his
candle
down
it
was
a
pot
tied
over
with
brown
paper
like
pickled
onions
when
he
got
it
out
he
took
off
the
paper
the
pot
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
gold
coins
hildebrand
blew
out
his
candle
and
went
up
the
cook
stopped
him
at
the
top
of
the
cellar
stairs
that
you
got
there
master
hildy
pickles
i
lay
my
boots
she
said
not
said
he
me
look
said
she
me
alone
said
hildebrand
me
said
the
cook
she
had
her
hand
on
the
brown
paper
hildebrand
had
heard
how
has
to
be
given
up
to
government
and
he
did
not
trust
the
cook
better
not
he
said
quickly
not
what
you
think
it
is
is
it
then
it
said
hildebrand
desperately
out
of
the
the
cook
went
into
hysterics
and
hildebrand
was
punished
twice
once
for
staying
away
from
school
without
leave
and
once
for
frightening
the
servants
with
silly
stories
but
in
the
confusion
brought
about
by
the
cook
screams
he
managed
to
hide
the
pot
of
gold
in
the
bottom
of
the
boot
cupboard
among
the
old
gaiters
and
goloshes
and
when
peace
was
restored
and
he
was
sent
to
bed
in
disgrace
he
took
the
pot
with
him
he
lay
long
awake
thinking
of
the
model
engine
he
would
buy
for
himself
also
of
the
bay
pony
the
collections
of
coins
birds
eggs
and
the
the
guns
revolvers
and
bows
and
arrows
the
sweets
and
cakes
and
nuts
he
would
get
all
for
himself
he
never
thought
of
so
much
as
a
pennyworth
of
toffee
for
ethel
or
a
silver
thimble
for
his
mother
or
a
twopenny
cigar
for
pilkings
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
jumped
up
and
felt
under
the
bed
for
the
pot
of
gold
his
hand
touched
something
that
was
not
the
pot
he
screamed
and
drew
his
hand
back
as
quickly
as
though
he
had
burned
it
but
what
he
had
touched
was
not
hot
it
was
cold
and
thin
and
alive
it
was
a
snake
and
there
was
another
on
his
bed
and
another
on
the
and
half
a
dozen
more
were
gliding
about
inquisitively
on
the
floor
hildebrand
gathered
his
clothes
together
a
snake
tumbled
out
of
his
shirt
as
he
lifted
it
and
made
one
bound
for
the
door
he
dressed
on
the
landing
and
went
to
school
without
breakfast
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
he
did
say
to
sarah
the
housemaid
goodness
sake
do
go
into
my
bedroom
it
running
alive
with
snakes
she
did
not
believe
him
of
course
and
indeed
when
she
went
up
the
snakes
were
safe
back
in
the
pot
she
did
not
see
this
because
she
was
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
sweeps
under
things
every
day
that
night
hildebrand
secretly
slept
in
the
boxroom
on
a
pile
of
newspapers
with
a
and
a
hearthrug
over
him
next
day
he
said
to
sarah
you
go
into
my
room
yesterday
course
said
she
you
take
the
snakes
away
along
with
your
snakes
she
said
so
he
understood
that
she
had
not
seen
any
and
very
cautiously
he
looked
into
his
room
and
finding
it
snakeless
crept
in
hoping
that
the
snakes
had
changed
back
into
gold
but
they
had
not
snakes
and
gold
and
pot
had
all
vanished
then
he
thought
he
would
be
very
careful
he
said
to
ethel
had
twenty
golden
sovereigns
in
my
pocket
yesterday
this
was
saturday
next
day
was
sunday
and
all
day
long
he
jingled
the
twenty
golden
sovereigns
he
had
found
that
morning
in
his
knickerbocker
pocket
but
they
were
not
there
on
monday
and
then
he
saw
that
though
he
could
make
things
he
could
not
make
them
so
he
told
ethel
he
had
had
seven
he
meant
to
eat
them
as
soon
as
he
got
them
but
the
next
day
when
they
came
he
had
a
headache
and
did
not
want
to
eat
them
he
might
have
given
them
to
ethel
but
he
did
and
next
day
they
had
disappeared
it
was
very
annoying
to
hildebrand
to
know
that
he
had
this
wonderful
power
yet
he
could
not
get
any
good
out
of
it
he
tried
to
consult
his
father
about
it
but
pilkings
said
he
had
no
time
for
romances
and
he
advised
hildebrand
to
learn
his
lessons
and
stick
to
the
truth
but
this
was
just
what
hildebrand
could
not
do
even
after
the
awful
occasion
when
his
schoolfellows
began
to
tease
him
again
and
to
command
their
respect
he
related
how
he
had
met
a
bear
in
the
lane
by
the
church
and
fought
it
and
been
carried
off
more
dead
than
alive
next
day
of
course
he
had
to
fight
the
bear
which
was
very
brown
and
clawy
and
toothy
and
fierce
and
though
the
feeling
had
gone
by
next
day
it
was
not
a
pleasant
experience
but
even
that
was
better
than
the
time
when
they
laughed
at
a
very
bad
construe
of
his
the
form
was
in
cæsar
and
he
told
them
how
he
had
once
translated
the
inscription
on
an
egyptian
pyramid
he
had
no
peace
for
weeks
after
that
because
he
had
forgotten
to
say
how
long
it
took
him
every
time
he
was
alone
he
was
wafted
away
to
egypt
and
set
down
at
that
pyramid
but
he
could
not
find
the
inscription
and
if
he
had
found
it
he
could
not
have
translated
it
so
in
he
spent
most
of
his
with
ethel
but
every
night
the
pyramid
had
its
own
way
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
cut
an
inscription
himself
on
the
pyramid
with
the
broken
blade
of
his
and
translated
it
into
english
that
he
was
allowed
any
rest
at
all
the
inscription
was
bin
eine
and
you
can
translate
it
for
yourself
but
that
did
him
good
in
one
way
it
made
him
fonder
of
ethel
being
so
much
with
her
he
began
to
see
what
a
jolly
little
girl
she
really
was
when
she
had
measles
hildebrand
had
had
them
or
it
last
christmas
so
he
was
allowed
to
see
his
sister
he
was
very
sorry
and
really
wished
to
do
something
for
her
pilkings
brought
her
some
hothouse
grapes
one
day
and
she
liked
them
so
much
that
they
were
very
soon
gone
then
hildebrand
who
had
been
very
careful
since
the
pyramid
occasion
to
say
nothing
but
the
truth
said
some
grapes
and
pineapples
came
for
you
yesterday
ethel
knew
it
was
true
but
she
liked
the
idea
and
said
else
yes
said
her
brother
wax
doll
and
a
china
with
pink
roses
on
it
and
books
and
games
and
he
went
on
to
name
everything
he
thought
she
would
like
and
of
course
next
day
the
things
came
in
a
great
no
one
ever
knew
who
sent
them
but
and
pilkings
thought
it
was
ethel
godfather
in
india
and
curiously
enough
these
things
did
not
vanish
away
but
were
eaten
and
enjoyed
and
played
with
as
long
as
they
lasted
ethel
has
one
of
the
dolls
still
though
now
she
is
quite
grown
up
now
hildebrand
began
to
feel
sorry
to
see
how
ill
and
worried
his
mother
looked
she
was
tired
out
with
nursing
ethel
so
he
said
to
sarah
was
quite
well
yesterday
sarah
answered
you
know
about
it
your
poor
ma
wore
to
a
shadow
illustration
alligator
very
nearly
had
him
page
but
next
day
mother
quite
well
and
this
lasted
too
then
he
wanted
to
do
something
for
his
father
and
as
he
had
heard
pilkings
complain
of
his
business
being
very
bad
hildebrand
said
to
ethel
made
a
most
awful
lot
of
money
yesterday
and
next
day
pilkings
came
home
and
kissed
pilkings
in
the
hall
under
the
very
eyes
of
sarah
and
the
and
said
dear
our
fortune
made
the
family
did
not
have
any
nicer
things
to
eat
or
wear
than
before
so
hildebrand
gained
nothing
by
this
unless
you
count
the
pleasure
he
had
in
seeing
his
father
always
jolly
and
cheerful
and
his
mother
well
and
not
worried
any
more
hildebrand
count
this
and
it
counted
for
a
good
deal
but
though
hildebrand
was
now
a
much
happier
as
well
as
a
more
agreeable
boy
he
could
not
quite
help
telling
a
startling
story
now
and
then
as
for
instance
when
he
informed
the
butcher
boy
that
there
was
an
alligator
in
the
the
butcher
boy
did
not
go
into
the
garden
indeed
he
had
no
business
there
though
that
would
have
been
no
reason
if
he
had
wanted
to
go
but
next
day
when
hildebrand
having
forgotten
all
about
the
matter
went
out
in
the
dusk
to
look
for
a
fives
ball
he
had
lost
the
alligator
very
nearly
had
him
and
when
he
related
that
adventure
of
the
lost
balloon
he
had
to
go
through
with
it
next
day
and
it
made
him
dizzy
for
months
only
to
think
of
it
but
the
worst
thing
of
all
was
when
ethel
was
well
and
he
was
allowed
to
go
back
to
school
somehow
the
fellows
were
much
jollier
with
him
than
they
used
to
be
even
billson
minor
was
quite
polite
and
asked
him
how
the
kid
was
all
right
said
hildebrand
my
kiddie
sister
had
measles
billson
said
eyes
got
bad
afterwards
she
could
hardly
see
said
hildebrand
promptly
sister
been
much
worse
than
that
she
could
see
at
all
when
hildebrand
went
home
next
day
he
found
his
mother
pale
and
in
tears
the
doctor
had
just
been
to
see
ethel
eyes
and
ethel
was
blind
then
hildebrand
went
up
to
his
own
room
he
had
done
this
his
own
little
sister
who
was
so
fond
of
him
and
she
was
such
a
jolly
little
thing
and
he
had
made
her
blind
just
for
a
silly
bit
of
to
billson
minor
and
he
knew
that
the
things
he
had
said
about
ethel
before
had
come
true
and
had
not
vanished
like
the
things
he
said
about
himself
and
he
felt
that
this
too
would
last
and
ethel
would
go
on
being
blind
always
so
he
lay
face
down
on
his
bed
and
cried
and
was
sorry
and
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
been
a
good
boy
and
had
never
looked
in
the
glass
and
wished
to
bung
up
the
eyes
of
billson
minor
who
after
all
was
not
such
a
bad
sort
of
chap
when
he
had
cried
till
he
could
not
cry
any
more
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
to
see
if
his
eyes
were
red
which
is
always
interesting
he
never
could
remember
that
he
could
see
himself
in
the
glass
now
then
suddenly
he
knew
what
to
do
he
ran
down
into
the
street
and
said
to
the
first
person
he
met
say
i
saw
the
boy
yesterday
and
he
let
me
off
things
coming
true
and
ethel
was
all
right
again
it
was
a
policeman
and
the
constable
boxed
his
ears
and
promised
to
run
him
in
next
time
he
had
any
of
his
cheek
but
hildebrand
went
home
calmer
and
he
read
jungle
book
aloud
to
ethel
all
the
evening
next
morning
he
ran
to
his
and
it
was
strange
and
wonderful
to
him
to
see
his
own
reflection
again
after
all
these
weeks
of
a
blank
mirror
and
of
parting
his
hair
as
well
as
he
could
just
by
feeling
but
it
was
his
own
reflection
of
course
it
was
the
boy
say
you
look
very
different
to
what
you
did
that
day
said
hildebrand
slowly
do
you
said
the
boy
that
other
day
which
was
weeks
ago
the
boy
had
been
swollen
and
scowling
and
angry
with
a
black
eye
and
a
cut
lip
and
revengeful
looks
and
spiteful
words
now
he
looked
pale
and
a
little
thinner
but
his
eyes
were
only
anxious
and
his
mouth
was
kind
it
was
just
the
same
ugly
shape
as
ever
but
it
looked
different
and
hildebrand
was
as
like
the
boy
in
the
glass
as
one
pin
is
like
another
pin
say
said
hildebrand
suddenly
and
earnestly
me
off
i
want
it
any
more
thank
you
and
oh
do
do
make
my
sister
all
right
again
well
said
the
boy
in
the
let
you
off
for
six
months
if
you
have
learned
to
speak
the
truth
by
then
well
you
see
he
held
out
his
hand
and
hildebrand
eagerly
reached
out
to
shake
it
he
had
forgotten
the
and
it
smashed
against
his
fist
and
cracked
all
over
he
never
saw
the
boy
again
and
he
did
not
want
to
when
he
went
down
ethel
eyes
were
all
right
again
and
the
doctor
thought
it
was
doing
and
was
as
proud
as
a
king
and
as
pleased
as
punch
hildebrand
could
only
express
his
own
gladness
by
giving
ethel
every
toy
he
had
that
he
thought
she
would
like
and
he
was
so
kind
to
her
that
she
cried
with
pleasure
before
the
six
months
were
up
hildebrand
was
as
truthful
a
boy
as
anyone
need
wish
to
meet
he
made
little
slips
now
and
then
just
at
first
about
his
escape
from
the
mad
bull
for
instance
and
about
the
his
stories
did
not
come
true
next
day
any
more
but
he
had
to
dream
them
which
was
nearly
as
bad
so
he
cured
himself
and
did
his
lessons
and
tried
to
stick
to
the
truth
and
when
he
told
romances
he
let
people
know
what
he
was
playing
at
now
he
is
grown
up
he
dreams
his
stories
first
and
writes
them
afterwards
for
he
writes
books
and
also
he
writes
for
the
newspapers
when
you
do
these
things
you
may
tell
as
many
stories
as
you
like
and
you
need
not
be
at
all
afraid
that
any
of
them
will
come
true
the
ring
and
the
lamp
you
are
of
course
a
singularly
intelligent
child
and
so
must
often
have
wondered
what
has
become
of
all
the
interesting
things
that
you
read
about
in
the
old
the
shoes
of
swiftness
and
the
sword
of
sharpness
and
the
cloak
that
made
its
wearer
invisible
and
things
like
that
well
the
fact
is
all
these
things
are
still
in
the
world
hidden
about
somewhere
only
people
are
so
busy
with
new
inventions
wireless
telegraphs
and
x
rays
and
that
they
do
trouble
any
more
to
look
for
the
really
interesting
things
and
if
you
look
for
things
you
do
find
them
at
least
not
often
though
some
lucky
persons
have
only
to
walk
out
of
doors
and
adventures
happen
to
them
as
readily
as
breakfast
and
bed
happen
to
ordinary
folk
but
when
people
do
find
any
of
the
wonderful
old
treasures
they
generally
hold
their
tongues
about
it
because
it
is
so
difficult
to
make
people
believe
the
truth
if
it
is
at
all
out
of
the
way
two
of
the
wonder
things
out
of
the
old
stories
were
found
only
the
other
day
by
a
little
girl
in
sussex
and
she
never
told
anyone
but
me
and
one
other
person
i
often
have
things
told
me
that
no
one
else
ever
hears
of
because
everyone
knows
that
i
can
believe
anything
the
name
was
seraphina
bodlett
she
did
not
belong
to
sussex
having
been
born
in
tooting
but
she
was
staying
at
a
sussex
farmhouse
for
the
summer
holidays
it
was
the
very
nicest
place
to
stay
at
plenty
of
room
to
play
in
all
the
sussex
downs
in
fact
and
plenty
of
animals
to
pet
and
feed
the
only
thing
was
that
all
the
other
people
at
the
farm
were
grown
up
and
seraphina
longed
very
much
for
someone
to
play
with
the
farmer
daughter
miss
patty
was
very
kind
and
always
quite
willing
to
play
halma
only
it
happened
that
halma
was
not
what
seraphina
wanted
to
play
it
was
summer
and
seraphina
went
to
bed
early
while
it
was
still
daylight
she
used
to
lie
awake
in
the
big
bed
with
the
white
dimity
curtains
and
look
at
the
latticed
window
and
the
oak
chest
of
drawers
with
the
shell
boxes
on
it
and
try
to
make
herself
dream
that
she
had
another
little
girl
to
play
with
but
she
always
surprised
herself
by
waking
up
in
the
morning
without
having
dreamed
of
anything
at
all
the
best
parlour
at
the
farm
was
a
very
nice
place
but
seraphina
whose
name
takes
so
long
to
write
that
i
think
i
had
better
call
her
fina
as
everyone
else
did
was
not
usually
allowed
to
play
there
and
the
blinds
were
always
drawn
down
exactly
halfway
because
that
is
genteel
sometimes
fina
was
taken
into
the
parlour
by
miss
patty
and
then
miss
patty
would
bring
out
the
curiosities
that
her
brother
the
sailor
had
brought
home
from
his
voyages
south
sea
necklaces
of
seeds
and
beads
and
reeds
and
fat
idols
from
india
with
far
more
arms
than
most
of
us
could
find
a
use
for
then
there
were
beady
pincushions
made
by
seamen
and
a
stuffed
parrot
exactly
like
life
except
that
one
eye
was
out
and
chinese
junks
in
beautiful
carved
ivory
and
a
pagoda
or
chinese
temple
and
that
was
of
ivory
too
and
all
carved
out
of
one
solid
block
miss
patty
said
fina
loved
the
pagoda
best
of
all
the
curiosities
you
could
see
right
into
it
it
was
a
tower
with
seven
stories
and
it
had
little
gold
bells
on
it
that
rang
when
miss
patty
took
off
the
glass
case
and
gently
shook
the
wooden
stand
of
course
fina
was
never
allowed
to
shake
it
herself
did
it
come
from
she
asked
this
question
every
time
she
was
shown
the
pagoda
came
from
the
emperor
of
china
own
summer
palace
at
pekin
miss
patty
always
said
my
brother
bob
never
would
tell
me
how
he
got
it
then
when
fina
had
had
a
last
peep
through
the
windows
of
the
pagoda
the
glass
case
would
be
put
on
again
and
fina
would
be
told
to
along
now
and
play
one
day
she
was
along
and
playing
when
she
met
a
playfellow
it
was
a
fat
foxhound
puppy
very
clumsy
and
very
affectionate
they
had
a
romp
together
and
then
the
puppy
blundered
off
and
fina
went
indoors
to
wash
her
hands
because
the
puppy
idea
of
a
romp
had
been
a
roll
in
the
dust
which
fina
had
gladly
consented
to
share
but
as
she
passed
the
door
of
the
best
parlour
she
stopped
a
minute
for
the
door
was
open
it
was
the
day
for
cleaning
out
the
room
but
miss
patty
had
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
cleaning
to
go
to
the
to
see
a
pedlar
who
had
some
really
wonderful
bargains
in
handkerchiefs
and
silk
dresses
and
mixed
white
pins
and
combs
fina
often
wondered
afterwards
whether
that
pedlar
was
a
real
pedlar
or
a
magician
in
disguise
now
fina
was
an
obedient
little
girl
she
did
slip
into
the
parlour
to
have
a
look
round
just
because
the
door
was
open
and
no
one
was
about
but
she
had
not
been
forbidden
to
in
if
she
got
the
chance
so
she
stood
at
the
door
and
looked
at
the
stuffed
parrot
and
the
junk
and
the
rest
of
the
things
and
as
she
looked
she
started
and
said
it
will
tumble
down
i
know
it
will
if
a
door
banged
even
and
just
then
the
bang
and
the
pagoda
trembled
for
it
was
standing
at
the
very
edge
of
the
chiffonnier
and
one
of
the
little
black
carved
of
its
stand
was
actually
overhanging
the
chiffonnier
edge
stand
it
steady
said
fina
i
go
and
tell
miss
patty
it
may
tumble
off
before
i
get
back
so
she
went
quickly
in
and
took
the
glass
case
and
stand
and
pagoda
very
carefully
in
her
hands
to
move
them
back
to
a
safe
place
it
was
this
very
moment
that
the
foxhound
puppy
chose
for
rushing
in
all
wriggle
and
bark
and
clumsy
paws
and
plunging
between
feet
she
reeled
staggered
and
she
the
puppy
the
stand
the
glass
case
and
the
precious
pagoda
all
went
down
together
in
a
crushing
heap
when
fina
picked
herself
up
the
puppy
tail
was
just
disappearing
round
the
door
and
at
her
feet
lay
a
scattered
heap
of
splintered
ivory
and
glass
the
hopeless
ruins
of
the
beautiful
pagoda
her
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
and
then
began
to
beat
so
hard
and
fast
that
she
felt
as
though
she
had
a
in
her
chest
her
hands
trembled
so
much
that
she
could
hardly
pick
up
the
pieces
but
she
did
begin
to
pick
them
up
it
could
be
mended
she
said
glue
or
white
of
egg
like
nurse
did
the
china
basin
only
the
pieces
are
so
small
and
chippety
some
of
them
that
i
do
see
how
you
could
ever
fit
them
together
and
miss
patty
will
be
in
in
a
minute
oh
i
wish
i
was
somebody
else
and
not
me
oh
whatever
will
she
say
among
the
shivered
splinters
of
ivory
the
little
gold
bells
were
scattered
what
that
said
fina
not
a
bell
or
she
picked
whatever
it
was
up
from
among
the
shattered
ivory
and
glass
it
was
a
gold
ring
thick
and
beautiful
with
a
strange
design
on
it
like
on
the
sides
of
she
slipped
it
on
her
hand
to
keep
it
safe
while
she
went
on
with
the
dismal
work
of
picking
up
the
pieces
and
then
suddenly
the
dreadfulness
of
the
deed
she
had
done
though
quite
the
puppy
fault
and
not
hers
at
all
came
over
her
she
began
to
breathe
quickly
and
then
to
make
faces
and
in
a
moment
she
was
sobbing
and
sniffing
and
rubbing
her
wet
eyes
with
her
knuckles
still
dirty
from
her
politeness
in
letting
the
puppy
choose
what
game
she
and
it
should
play
at
she
was
roused
from
her
crying
by
a
voice
and
it
was
not
miss
voice
it
said
servant
miss
what
can
i
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
for
you
she
took
her
knuckles
out
of
her
eyes
and
saw
from
between
her
very
dirty
eyelids
a
tall
footman
who
was
bowing
respectfully
before
her
he
was
dressed
wonderfully
in
green
satin
his
large
and
lovely
legs
wore
white
silk
stockings
and
his
hair
was
powdered
till
it
was
as
white
as
the
inside
of
a
fleece
illustration
your
servant
miss
do
i
understand
that
you
order
me
to
mend
this
page
you
said
fina
sobbing
but
polite
one
can
do
anything
for
me
unless
they
can
mend
all
this
and
of
course
nobody
can
servant
miss
said
the
footman
i
understand
that
you
order
me
to
mend
this
you
can
said
fina
a
ray
of
hope
lighting
her
blighted
existence
of
course
what
the
pagoda
stood
on
the
table
indeed
it
seemed
as
though
there
had
never
been
any
breaking
it
was
there
safe
and
sound
as
it
had
always
been
on
its
ebony
stand
with
the
shining
bubble
of
its
glass
case
rising
over
it
the
footman
had
vanished
said
fina
suppose
it
was
all
a
waking
dream
how
horrible
i
read
of
waking
dreams
but
i
did
know
there
were
ever
waking
nightmares
perhaps
i
better
wash
my
hands
and
my
face
she
added
when
she
saw
it
round
red
and
streaked
with
mud
made
of
dust
and
tears
in
the
glass
of
the
chiffonnier
she
dipped
her
face
in
fresh
water
in
the
basin
in
her
big
attic
bedroom
then
she
washed
her
hands
and
as
she
began
to
rub
the
soap
on
she
heard
a
noise
servant
miss
what
can
i
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
for
you
and
there
was
that
footman
again
are
you
said
fina
do
you
follow
me
about
am
the
slave
of
the
ring
please
miss
replied
the
footman
with
another
bow
of
course
when
you
rubs
it
i
appears
slave
of
the
ring
said
fina
letting
the
soapsuds
drip
from
her
hands
to
the
carpet
you
mean
aladdin
ring
ring
belonged
to
the
gentleman
you
mentions
at
one
time
miss
i
thought
the
slave
of
the
ring
was
a
genie
a
great
foaming
fierce
black
slave
in
a
turban
is
changed
miss
said
the
footman
this
here
civilised
country
there
are
no
slaves
only
servants
you
have
to
keep
up
with
the
times
even
if
you
a
i
thought
the
slave
of
the
ring
spoke
chinese
i
does
miss
when
in
that
country
but
whatever
be
the
use
of
talking
chinese
to
you
tell
me
oh
there
the
look
here
i
wish
you
not
keep
appearing
so
suddenly
it
does
startle
me
so
do
you
go
on
rubbing
the
ring
sudden
miss
it
that
as
does
it
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
miss
now
said
fina
and
he
vanished
as
she
spoke
when
fina
sat
down
to
dinner
in
the
farm
kitchen
a
very
nice
dinner
it
was
boiled
pork
and
beans
and
a
to
follow
she
picked
up
her
knife
and
fork
and
clutched
them
hard
they
felt
real
enough
but
the
footman
she
must
have
dreamed
him
and
the
ring
she
had
left
the
ring
in
the
drawer
upstairs
for
fear
she
should
rub
it
accidentally
she
knew
what
a
start
it
would
give
miss
patty
and
the
farmer
if
a
genie
footman
suddenly
appeared
from
nowhere
and
stood
behind
their
chairs
at
dinner
miss
patty
seemed
very
cheerful
a
piece
of
luck
father
was
it
that
pedlar
wanting
chinese
things
he
gave
me
two
pieces
of
broadcloth
that
cut
into
three
or
four
coats
for
you
and
a
length
of
black
silk
that
rich
stand
alone
and
ten
pounds
in
gold
and
half
a
dozen
silk
said
the
farmer
was
a
good
bargain
for
you
and
bob
give
you
the
pagoda
and
you
a
right
to
do
as
you
like
with
your
own
miss
patty
said
fina

and
sold
the
pagoda

beautiful
darling
pagoda
i
have
dear
but
never
mind
i
buy
you
a
new
doll
out
of
the
money
i
got
for
it
you
said
fina
but
the
pork
and
beans
did
not
taste
so
nice
now
she
knew
that
the
pretty
pagoda
was
sold
also
she
was
rather
worried
about
the
ring
ought
she
to
keep
it
she
had
found
it
of
course
but
someone
must
have
lost
it
yet
she
could
bear
to
give
it
up
when
she
had
made
the
slave
of
it
do
a
single
thing
for
her
except
to
mend
the
pagoda
after
dinner
fina
went
and
got
the
ring
she
was
very
careful
not
to
rub
it
till
she
was
safe
and
alone
in
a
quiet
green
nook
in
the
little
wood
at
the
end
of
the
garden
where
the
hazels
and
sweet
chestnuts
and
hornbeams
grew
so
closely
that
she
was
quite
hidden
then
she
rubbed
the
ring
and
instantly
the
footman
was
there
but
there
was
no
room
for
him
to
stand
up
under
the
thicket
so
he
appeared
kneeling
and
trying
to
bow
in
that
position
it
not
a
dream
said
she
often
i
have
heard
them
very
words
said
the
slave
of
the
ring
want
you
to
tell
me
things
said
fina

down

so
uncomfortable
like
that

the
footman
very
thoughtful
for
a
child
of
your
age
and

this
age

ai
what
it
was

me
she
said

of
them
but

old
as

it
come
from
just
now
when
i
found
it
why

out
of
the
pagoda
of
course
the
floor
of
the
third
story
was
made
double
and
the
ring
was
stuck
between
the
floor
of
that
and
the
ceiling
of
the
second
floor
and
when
you
smashed
the
pagoda
o

feet
among
the
dead
leaves

was
a
farthing
dutch
doll

say
what
sort
of
a

the
footman
when
she
had

the
afternoon

with
the
beautiful
ivory
toy
but
when
it
was
she
had
to
ask
the
genie
footman
to
take
it
away
again
for
she
dared
not
face
the
questions
and
she
could
not
invent
the
explanations
that
would
have
followed
if
she
had
turned
up
at
the
house
with
the
pagoda
under
her
arm
you
will
think
that
fina
ought
to
have
been
the
happiest
of
little
girls
now
that
she
had
a
genie
footman
slave
of
the
ring
in
a
green
coat
to
get
her
anything
she
wanted
and
run
her
errands
on
his
beautiful
white
silk
legs
but
this
was
not
so
it
was
all
very
well
to
go
into
the
wood
every
day
and
make
the
footman
fetch
her
the
most
beautiful
dolls
and
toys
and
sweets
but
even
sweets
are
dull
if
you
eat
them
alone
and
what
is
the
use
of
toys
or
even
pagodas
if
you
have
no
one
to
show
them
to
and
dare
not
have
them
except
in
a
secret
corner
of
the
wood
she
tried
to
get
the
footman
to
play
with
her
but
he
said
that
was
a
little
more
than
anyone
could
expect
and
began
again
about
his
sorrows
and
as
for
getting
him
to
take
any
interest
in
the
wonderful
things
he
fetched
for
her
she
felt
at
once
that
these
were
nothing
to
a
genie
footman
with
such
a
jewelled
and
exciting
past
as
his
she
was
not
a
very
clever
little
girl
she
wished
for
a
white
pony
and
of
course
it
came
but
there
was
no
room
for
it
in
the
wood
and
it
walked
on
her
foot
and
tried
to
bite
her
and
she
hastily
had
to
send
it
away
she
wished
for
a
pet
lamb
but
it
baaed
so
loudly
that
she
was
almost
discovered
by
the
farmer
so
that
had
to
go
too
and
she
had
been
wishing
for
these
vain
and
unsatisfying
things
for
more
than
a
week
before
she
thought
of
asking
for
a
little
girl
to
play
with
the
genie
brought
a
little
girl
at
once
but
she
was
a
horrid
little
girl
with
a
red
pigtail
and
a
green
frock
trimmed
with
black
bead
trimming
and
she
broke
the
toys
and
laughed
at
fina
when
she
tried
to
tell
her
the
story
of
the
pagoda
and
the
ring
slave
also
there
was
no
room
to
play
in
the
secret
nook
in
the
wood
and
when
the
little
girl
had
slapped
fina
and
taken
the
pagoda
away
from
her
it
seemed
best
to
ask
the
genie
to
take
the
little
girl
herself
away
fina
never
saw
her
again
and
never
wanted
to
either
at
last
fina
knew
that
what
she
really
wanted
was
not
only
someone
to
play
with
but
a
good
place
to
play
in
so
she
shut
her
eyes
and
thought
as
hard
as
a
not
very
clever
person
of
eight
can
think
and
then
she
rubbed
the
ring
and
said
take
me
somewhere
where
there
is
a
little
girl
who
will
play
with
me
a
nice
little
girl
and
room
to
play
in
and
at
once
the
wood
vanished
like
a
picture
when
the
kind
clergyman
who
is
showing
it
changes
the
slide
and
she
was
in
a
strange
room
illustration
little
girl
had
slapped
fina
and
taken
the
pagoda
away
page
it
was
a
nursery
very
large
and
light
there
were
flowers
at
the
window
and
pictures
on
the
walls
and
many
toys
and
on
a
couch
covered
with
a
bright
green
rug
with
yellow
daisies
embroidered
on
it
lay
a
little
girl
with
pretty
yellow
hair
and
kind
merry
blue
eyes
said
the
little
girl
very
much
astonished
said
fina
at
the
same
minute
and
with
the
same
quantity
of
astonishment
come
to
play
with
you
if
you
let
me
said
fina
lovely
but
how
did
you
get
in
slave
of
the
ring
brought
me
slave
of
the
ring
how
wonderful
is
it
what
your
name
fina
would
you
like
to
see
my
ring
slave
ella
oh
yes
ella
was
laughing
softly
fina
rubbed
the
ring
and
the
footman
genie
appeared
his
silk
legs
more
beautifully
silk
than
ever
fetch
the
pagoda
the
pagoda
toppled
on
to
the
couch
and
the
genie
vanished
as
he
always
did
when
he
had
executed
an
order
when
ella
had
admired
the
pagoda
which
she
did
very
thoroughly
and
satisfyingly
she
said
now
i
show
you
she
pulled
a
battered
iron
thing
from
under
her
pillow
and
rubbed
it
instantly
a
very
grand
stout
gentleman
in
evening
dress
stood
before
them
he
had
most
respectable
whiskers
and
he
said
can
i
do
for
you
madam
is
it
whispered
fina
the
slave
of
the
lamp
said
ella
says
he
disguised
as
a
perfect
butler
because
times
have
changed
so
since
time
him
away
said
fina
dear
ella
she
went
on
when
they
were
alone
me
all
about
yours
and
i
tell
you
all
about
mine
said
ella
found
the
lamp
at
the
seaside
just
before
i
hurt
my
back
i
fell
off
the
you
know
and
i
sha
be
able
to
walk
for
ever
so
long
and
one
day
i
rubbed
it
by
accident
and
since
then
my
beautiful
perfect
butler
gets
me
anything
i
want
look
here
i
tell
him
to
make
it
like
it
was
yesterday
the
lamp
was
rubbed
the
order
given
and
the
nursery
became
a
palace
hall
hung
with
cloth
of
gold
and
blazing
with
jewels
and
lamps
ca
your
butler
cure
your
back
time
is
the
only
genie
who
can
do
that
my
butler
says
you
know
how
i
wanted
someone
to
show
it
all
to
but
i
never
thought
of
wishing
for
you
it
only
a
week
since
i
found
the
lamp
they
leave
you
alone
all
the
time
no
only
when
i
say
i
sleepy
and
my
butler
has
orders
to
change
everything
to
ordinary
directly
the
turns
you
told
anyone
my
butler
says
if
you
tell
anyone
that
you
got
the
lamp
it
will
vanish
away
i
ca
remember
whether
it
like
that
in
the
arabian
nights
perhaps
it
a
new
rule
the
two
little
girls
talked
all
the
afternoon
about
the
wonderful
things
they
would
make
their
slaves
do
for
them
and
they
were
so
contented
with
each
other
company
that
they
never
once
called
on
their
slaves
for
anything
but
when
fina
began
to
feel
the
inside
feeling
that
means
teatime
she
rubbed
the
ring
for
her
slave
to
take
her
back
to
the
farm
get
my
slave
to
take
me
to
see
you
home
said
ella
can
carry
me
quite
without
hurting
me
so
she
rubbed
the
lamp
and
the
stately
butler
instantly
appeared
ella
began
but
the
glorious
butler
interrupted
he
said
to
the
footman
are
you
doing
here
in
service
with
this
young
lady
lamp
sir
me
the
ring
james
and
instantly
the
footman
took
the
ring
very
gently
but
quite
irresistibly
from
fina
finger
and
handed
it
to
the
butler
fina
cried
no
right
to
take
my
ring
and
he
no
right
to
obey
you
he
slave
me
madam
said
the
butler
looking
more
and
more
perfect
and
more
and
more
the
sort
of
person
who
is
sure
to
know
best
is
not
slave
he
is
the
slave
of
the
ring
but
then
you
see
he
is
a
footman
and
footmen
have
to
obey
butlers
all
the
world
over
illustration
we
see
if
you
are
going
to
begin
of
me
about
page
so
miss
said
the
footman
the
lamp
stronger
than
the
ring
he
snatched
up
the
lamp
then
he
said
turning
fiercely
to
the
butler
see
if
you
going
to
begin
of
me
about
the
butler
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
scratch
his
head
thoughtfully
he
said
after
a
pause
got
to
own
that
you
got
the
better
of
me
there
james
rings
but
why
dispute
which
is
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
footman
like
yourself
to
say
nothing
of
the
dignity
of
a
butler
which
is
a
thing
words
ca
do
justice
to
my
slave
because
i
got
the
ring
and
because
i
a
butler
and
you
a
footman
and
i
your
slave
because
you
got
the
lamp
it
half
a
dozen
of
one
and
six
and
a
half
of
the
other
ca
we
come
to
some
agreement
between
ourselves
james
cried
ella
about
are
excessively
sorry
to
cause
any
inconvenience
madam
said
the
butler
we
give
you
five
minutes
notice
we
are
leaving
service
for
good
lamps
cried
ella
you
were
always
such
a
beautiful
butler
i
thought
you
enjoyed
being
it
you
make
any
mistake
miss
the
footman
put
in
being
in
service
though
they
has
to
put
up
with
it
me
and
lamps
is
retiring
from
service
perhaps
we
may
take
a
little
business
and
go
into
partnership
and
always
wishing
you
well
young
ladies
both
said
fina
go
and
leave
me
here
why
i
should
never
get

do
so
much
as

what
county
i
in
in
auckland
miss
said
james
is
such
a
country
me
madam
said
the
butler

in
new
zealand
cry
miss
said
james
lamps
only
give
the
word
i

you
home
then
i
shall
never
see
ella
again
tell
lamps
to
rub
the
ring
and
tell
you
to
arrange
for
me
to
come
and
live
near
her
in
england
cried
ella
he
do
that
i
care
i
rather
have
a
friend
than
twenty
slaves
very
proper
sentiment
said
the
butler
approvingly
there
any
other
little
thing
we
could
do
to
oblige
you
pagoda
said
fina
you
could
only
get
it
back
to
miss
patty
so
that
she
wo
lose
the
things
she
sold
it
for
and
wo
know
about
the
ring
having
been
in
it
it
done
madam
said
the
slave
of
the
lamp
stroking
his
respectable
butlerial
whisker
if
you
ready
your
footman
shall
see
you
home
oh
said
the
little
girls
kissing
each
other
very
much
then
fina
shut
her
eyes
and
there
she
was
in
the
wood
in
sussex
alone
i
dreamed
it
all
she
said
and
went
slowly
home
to
tea
the
first
thing
she
saw
on
the
was
the
pagoda
and
the
next
was
a
sailor
eating
hot
buttered
toast
in
the
windsor
armchair
may
you
look
said
miss
patty
is
my
brother
bob
newly
arrived
from
foreign
parts
and
he
met
that
pedlar
and
bought
the
pagoda
off
him
for
two
pounds
and
a
cockatoo
he
was
bringing
home
and
these
ten
sovereigns
the
wicked
old
man
gave
me
are
bad
ones
but
the
dresses
and
the
cloth
are
good
it
a
wonderful
world
fina
thought
so
too
now
the
oddest
thing
about
all
this
is
that
six
months
later
some
new
people
came
to
live
in
the
house
next
door
to
the
house
where
fina
lived
in
tooting
and
those
new
people
came
from
new
zealand
and
one
of
them
was
called
ella
fina
knew
her
at
once
but
ella
had
forgotten
her
and
forgotten
the
beautiful
perfect
butler
and
the
perfect
footman
and
the
lamp
and
the
ring
and
everything
perhaps
a
long
is
bad
for
the
memory
anyway
the
two
little
girls
are
close
friends
and
ella
loves
to
hear
fina
tell
the
story
of
the
two
slaves
though
she
does
believe
a
word
of
it
fina
father
and
ella
father
have
left
tooting
now
they
live
in
lovely
houses
at
haslemere
and
fina
has
a
white
pony
and
ella
has
a
brown
one
their
fathers
are
very
rich
now
they
both
got
situations
as
managers
to
branch
houses
of
lamps
rings
and
electrical
engineers
lamps
attends
to
the
lighting
department
and
mr
rings
is
at
the
head
of
the
bells
which
always
ring
beautifully
and
i
hear
that
ella
father
and
fina
father
are
likely
to
be
taken
into
partnership
bodlett
has
bought
the
pagoda
at
fina
earnest
request
and
it
stands
on
a
sideboard
in
his
handsome
fina
sometimes
asks
it
whether
she
really
did
dream
the
whole
story
or
not
but
it
never
says
a
word
of
course
you
and
i
know
that
every
word
of
the
story
is
true
the
charmed
life
or
the
princess
and
the
there
was
once
a
prince
whose
father
failed
in
business
and
lost
everything
he
had
in
the
world
crown
kingdom
money
jewels
and
friends
this
was
because
he
was
so
fond
of
machinery
that
he
was
always
making
working
models
of
things
he
invented
and
so
had
no
time
to
attend
to
the
duties
that
kings
are
engaged
for
so
he
lost
his
situation
there
is
a
king
in
french
history
who
was
fond
of
machinery
particularly
and
he
lost
everything
too
even
his
head
the
king
in
this
story
kept
his
head
however
and
when
he
was
allowed
to
make
laws
any
more
he
was
quite
contented
to
go
on
making
machines
and
as
his
machines
were
a
great
deal
better
than
his
laws
had
ever
been
he
soon
got
a
nice
little
business
together
and
was
able
to
buy
a
house
in
another
kingdom
and
settle
down
comfortably
with
his
wife
and
son
the
house
was
one
of
those
delightful
villas
called
after
queen
anne
the
one
whose
death
is
still
so
often
mentioned
and
so
justly
deplored
with
stained
glass
to
the
and
coloured
tiles
on
the
path
and
gables
where
there
was
never
need
of
gables
and
nice
geraniums
and
calceolarias
in
the
and
pretty
red
brick
on
the
front
of
the
house
the
back
of
the
house
was
yellow
brick
because
that
did
not
show
so
much
here
the
king
and
the
queen
and
the
prince
lived
very
pleasantly
the
queen
snipped
the
dead
geraniums
off
with
a
pair
of
gold
scissors
and
did
for
bazaars
the
prince
went
to
the
school
and
the
king
worked
up
his
business
in
due
time
the
prince
was
apprenticed
to
his
father
trade
and
a
very
industrious
apprentice
he
was
and
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
idle
apprentices
who
play
pitch
and
toss
on
tombstones
as
you
see
in
hogarth
picture
when
the
prince
was
his
mother
called
him
to
her
she
put
down
the
she
was
embroidering
for
the
school
bazaar
in
tasteful
pattern
of
stocks
and
nasturtiums
and
said
dear
son
you
have
had
the
usual
presents
silver
and
a
handsome
set
of
brushes
with
your
initials
on
the
back
a
gladstone
bag
also
richly
initialled
the
complete
works
of
dickens
and
thackeray
a
swan
mounted
in
gold
and
the
heartfelt
blessing
of
your
father
and
mother
but
there
is
still
one
more
present
for
you
are
too
good
mamma
said
the
prince
fingering
the
silks
fidget
said
the
queen
listen
to
me
when
you
were
a
baby
a
fairy
who
was
your
godmother
gave
you
a
most
valuable
present
a
charmed
life
as
long
as
you
keep
it
safely
nothing
can
harm
you
delightful
said
the
prince
mamma
you
might
have
let
me
go
to
sea
when
i
wanted
to
it
would
have
been
quite
safe
my
dear
said
the
queen
it
best
to
be
careful
i
have
taken
care
of
your
life
all
these
years
but
now
you
are
old
enough
to
take
care
of
it
for
yourself
let
me
advise
you
to
keep
it
in
a
safe
place
you
should
never
carry
valuables
about
on
your
person
and
then
she
handed
the
charmed
life
over
to
him
and
he
took
it
and
kissed
her
and
thanked
her
for
the
pretty
present
and
went
away
and
hid
it
he
took
a
brick
out
of
the
wall
of
the
villa
and
hid
his
life
behind
it
the
bricks
in
the
walls
of
these
queen
anne
villas
generally
come
out
quite
easily
now
the
father
of
the
prince
had
been
king
of
bohemia
so
of
course
the
prince
was
called
florizel
which
is
their
family
name
but
when
the
king
went
into
business
he
went
in
as
rex
bloomsbury
and
his
great
patent
lightning
lift
company
called
itself
bloomsbury
and
so
that
the
prince
was
known
as
bloomsbury
which
was
as
near
as
the
king
dared
go
to
prince
of
bohemia
his
mother
i
am
sorry
to
say
called
him
florrie
till
he
was
quite
grown
up
now
the
king
of
the
country
where
florizel
lived
was
a
very
sort
of
man
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
there
were
such
things
as
lifts
which
was
not
for
a
long
time
because
no
one
ever
lets
a
king
know
anything
if
it
can
be
helped
he
ordered
one
of
the
very
very
best
for
his
palace
next
day
a
card
was
brought
in
by
one
of
the
palace
footmen
it
had
on
it
bloomsbury
bloomsbury
and
him
in
said
the
king
sire
said
florizel
bowing
with
that
perfect
grace
which
is
proper
to
princes
young
man
said
the
king
this
lift
now
sire
may
i
ask
how
much
your
majesty
is
prepared
to
never
mind
price
said
the
king
all
comes
out
of
the
taxes
should
think
then
that
class
a
our
special
argentinella
design
white
satin
cushions
woodwork
overlaid
with
ivory
and
inset
with
pearls
opals
and
silver
said
the
king
shortly
with
pearls
and
ivory
said
florizel
firmly
he
had
excellent
taste
gold
pattern
we
call
it
the
anriradia
is
inlaid
with
sapphires
emeralds
and
black
diamonds
have
the
gold
pattern
said
the
king
you
might
run
up
a
little
special
lift
for
the
princess
apartments
i
dare
say
she
like
that
argentinella
pattern
simple
and
girlish
i
see
it
says
in
your
circular
so
florizel
booked
the
order
and
the
gold
and
sapphire
and
emerald
lift
was
made
and
fixed
and
all
the
court
was
so
delighted
that
it
spent
its
whole
time
in
going
up
and
down
in
the
lift
and
there
had
to
be
new
blue
satin
cushions
within
a
week
then
the
prince
superintended
the
fixing
of
the
princess
lift
the
argentinella
design
and
the
princess
candida
herself
came
to
look
on
at
the
works
and
she
and
florizel
met
and
their
eyes
met
and
their
hands
met
because
his
caught
hers
and
dragged
her
back
just
in
time
to
save
her
from
being
crushed
by
a
heavy
steel
bar
that
was
being
lowered
into
its
place
you
saved
my
life
said
the
princess
but
florizel
could
say
nothing
his
heart
was
beating
too
fast
and
it
seemed
to
be
beating
in
his
throat
and
not
in
its
proper
place
behind
his
waistcoat
are
you
said
the
princess
an
engineer
said
the
prince
dear
said
the
princess
thought
you
were
a
prince
i
sure
you
look
more
like
a
prince
than
any
prince
ever
seen
wish
i
was
a
prince
said
florizel
i
never
wished
it
till
three
minutes
ago
the
princess
smiled
and
then
she
frowned
and
then
she
went
away
florizel
went
straight
back
to
the
office
where
his
father
rex
bloomsbury
was
busy
at
his
he
spent
the
morning
at
the
office
and
the
afternoon
in
the
workshop
he
said
do
know
what
ever
will
become
of
me
i
wish
i
was
a
prince
the
king
and
queen
of
bohemia
had
never
let
their
son
know
that
he
was
a
prince
for
what
is
the
use
of
being
a
prince
if
there
never
going
to
be
a
kingdom
for
you
now
the
king
who
was
called
bloomsbury
looked
at
his
son
over
his
spectacles
and
said
i
been
and
gone
and
fallen
head
over
ears
in
love
with
the
princess
candida
the
father
rubbed
his
nose
thoughtfully
with
his
fountain
pen
he
said
fixed
your
choice
high
cried
the
prince
distractedly
was
much
choice
about
it
she
just
looked
at
me
and
there
i
was
do
you
know
i
to
fall
in
love
like
this
oh
father
it
hurts
most
awfully
what
ever
shall
i
do
after
a
long
pause
full
of
thought
his
father
replied
it
i
suppose
i
bear
it
at
least
not
unless
i
can
see
her
every
day
nothing
else
in
the
world
matters
in
the
least
me
said
his
father
i
disguise
myself
as
a
prince
and
try
to
make
her
like
me
a
little
disguise
you
suggest
is
quite
beyond
our
means
at
present
i
disguise
myself
as
a
lift
attendant
said
florizel
and
what
is
more
he
did
it
his
father
did
not
interfere
he
believed
in
letting
young
people
manage
their
own
love
affairs
so
that
when
the
lift
was
finished
and
the
princess
and
her
ladies
crowded
round
to
make
the
first
ascent
in
it
there
was
florizel
dressed
in
white
satin
and
coat
with
buttons
he
had
silver
buckles
to
his
shoes
and
a
tiny
opal
on
the
lappet
of
his
coat
where
the
white
flower
goes
at
weddings
when
the
princess
saw
him
she
said
none
of
you
girls
are
to
go
in
the
lift
at
all
mind
it
lift
you
can
use
the
other
one
or
go
up
the
staircase
as
usual
then
she
stepped
into
the
lift
and
the
silver
doors
clicked
and
the
lift
went
up
just
carrying
her
and
him
she
had
put
on
a
white
silky
gown
to
match
the
new
lift
and
she
too
had
silver
buckles
on
her
shoes
and
a
string
of
pearls
round
her
throat
and
a
silver
chain
set
with
opals
in
her
dark
hair
and
she
had
a
bunch
of
jasmine
flowers
at
her
neck
as
the
lift
went
out
of
sight
the
youngest
whispered
a
pretty
pair
why
they
made
for
each
other
what
a
pity
a
he
looks
exactly
like
a
prince
your
tongue
silly
said
the
eldest
and
slapped
her
the
princess
went
up
and
down
in
the
lift
all
the
morning
and
when
at
last
she
had
to
step
out
of
it
because
the
palace
had
rung
three
times
and
the
roast
peacock
was
getting
cold
the
eldest
noticed
that
the
had
a
jasmine
flower
fastened
to
his
coat
with
a
little
opal
pin
the
eldest
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
the
princess
but
after
that
first
day
the
princess
only
seemed
to
go
up
and
down
in
the
lift
when
it
was
really
necessary
and
then
she
always
took
the
youngest
with
her
so
that
though
the
always
had
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
it
had
not
been
given
him
by
his
mother
suppose
i
a
silly
suspicious
little
thing
said
the
eldest
course
it
was
the
lift
that
amused
her
just
at
first
how
a
princess
be
interested
in
a
now
when
people
are
in
love
and
want
to
be
quite
certain
that
they
are
loved
in
return
they
will
take
any
risks
to
find
out
what
they
want
to
know
but
as
soon
as
they
are
they
begin
to
be
careful
and
after
those
ups
and
downs
in
the
lift
on
the
first
day
the
princess
no
longer
had
any
doubt
that
she
was
beloved
by
the
not
that
he
had
said
a
word
about
it
but
she
was
a
clever
princess
and
she
had
seen
how
he
picked
up
the
jasmine
flower
she
let
fell
and
kissed
it
when
she
pretended
she
was
looking
and
he
pretended
he
did
know
she
was
of
course
she
had
been
in
love
with
him
ever
since
they
met
and
their
eyes
met
and
their
hands
she
told
herself
it
was
because
he
had
saved
her
life
but
that
was
the
real
reason
at
all
so
being
quite
sure
she
began
to
be
careful
he
really
loves
me
he
find
a
way
to
tell
me
so
right
out
it
his
part
not
mine
to
make
everything
possible
she
said
as
for
florizel
he
was
quite
happy
he
saw
her
every
day
and
every
day
when
he
took
his
place
in
his
lift
there
was
a
fresh
jasmine
flower
lying
on
the
satin
cushion
and
he
pinned
it
into
his
buttonhole
and
wore
it
there
all
day
and
thought
of
his
lady
and
of
how
that
first
wonderful
day
she
had
dropped
a
jasmine
flower
and
how
he
had
picked
it
up
when
she
pretended
she
was
not
looking
and
he
was
pretending
that
he
did
not
know
she
was
but
all
the
same
he
wanted
to
know
exactly
how
that
jasmine
flower
came
there
every
day
and
whose
hand
brought
it
it
might
be
the
youngest
but
florizel
did
think
so
so
he
went
to
the
palace
one
morning
bright
and
early
much
earlier
than
usual
and
there
was
no
jasmine
flower
then
he
hid
behind
one
of
the
white
velvet
of
the
corridor
and
waited
and
presently
who
should
come
stealing
along
on
the
tips
of
her
pink
toes
so
as
to
make
no
noise
at
all
but
the
princess
herself
fresh
as
the
morning
in
a
white
muslin
frock
with
a
silver
ribbon
round
her
darling
waist
and
a
bunch
of
jasmine
at
her
neck
she
took
one
of
the
jasmine
flowers
and
kissed
it
and
laid
it
on
the
white
satin
seat
of
the
lift
and
when
she
stepped
back
there
was
the
said
candida
and
blushed
like
a
child
that
is
caught
in
mischief
said
florizel
and
he
picked
up
the
jasmine
and
kissed
it
many
times
do
you
do
that
said
the
princess
you
did
said
the
prince
saw
you
do
you
want
to
go
on
pretending
any
more
the
princess
did
not
know
what
to
say
so
she
said
nothing
florizel
came
and
stood
quite
close
to
her
used
to
wish
i
was
a
prince
he
said
i
do
now
i
rather
be
an
engineer
if
i
been
a
prince
i
should
never
have
seen
you
do
want
you
to
be
a
bit
different
said
the
princess
and
she
stooped
to
smell
the
jasmine
in
his
buttonhole
we
betrothed
said
florizel
we
said
candida
we
he
said
yes
i
suppose
we
are
said
she
well
then
said
florizel
and
he
kissed
the
princess
sure
you
do
mind
marrying
an
engineer
he
said
when
she
had
kissed
him
back
course
not
said
the
princess
i
buy
the
ring
said
he
and
kissed
her
again
then
she
gave
him
the
rest
of
the
jasmine
with
a
kiss
for
each
star
and
he
gave
her
a
little
keepsake
in
return
and
they
parted
heart
is
yours
said
florizel
my
life
is
in
your
hands
life
is
yours
said
she
my
heart
is
in
your
heart
now
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
somebody
had
been
listening
all
the
time
behind
another
curtain
and
when
the
princess
had
gone
to
her
breakfast
and
the
had
gone
down
in
his
lift
this
somebody
came
out
and
said
it
was
a
wicked
ugly
disagreeable
who
would
have
liked
to
marry
the
princess
himself
he
had
really
no
chance
and
never
could
have
had
because
his
father
was
only
a
rich
brewer
but
he
felt
himself
to
be
much
superior
to
a
and
he
was
the
kind
of
boy
who
always
sneaks
if
he
has
half
a
chance
so
he
went
and
told
the
king
that
he
had
seen
the
princess
kissing
the
in
the
morning
all
bright
and
early
the
king
said
he
was
a
lying
hound
and
put
him
in
prison
at
once
for
mentioning
such
a
thing
which
served
him
right
then
the
king
thought
it
best
to
find
out
for
himself
whether
the
had
spoken
the
truth
so
he
watched
in
the
morning
all
bright
and
early
and
he
saw
the
princess
come
stealing
along
on
the
tips
of
her
little
pink
toes
and
the
lift
argentinella
design
came
up
and
the
in
it
and
the
princess
gave
him
kissed
jasmine
to
put
in
his
buttonhole
so
the
king
jumped
out
on
them
and
startled
them
dreadfully
and
florizel
was
locked
up
in
prison
and
the
princess
was
locked
up
in
her
room
with
only
the
eldest
to
keep
her
company
and
the
princess
cried
all
day
and
all
night
and
she
managed
to
hide
the
keepsake
the
prince
had
given
her
she
hid
it
in
a
little
book
of
verses
and
the
eldest
lady
saw
her
do
it
florizel
was
condemned
to
be
executed
for
having
wanted
to
marry
someone
so
much
above
him
in
station
but
when
the
axe
fell
on
his
neck
the
axe
flew
to
pieces
and
the
neck
was
not
hurt
at
all
so
they
sent
for
another
axe
and
tried
again
and
again
the
axe
splintered
and
flew
and
when
they
picked
up
the
bits
of
the
axe
they
had
all
turned
to
leaves
of
poetry
books
so
they
put
off
the
execution
till
next
day
the
gaoler
told
the
page
all
about
it
when
he
took
him
his
dinner
of
green
water
and
mouldering
crusts
do
the
trick
said
the
gaoler
axes
broke
off
short
and
the
bits
turned
to
rubbish
the
executioner
says
the
rascal
has
a
charmed
life
course
he
has
said
the
ugly
page
sniffing
at
the
crusts
with
his
know
all
about
that
but
i
sha
tell
unless
the
king
gives
me
a
free
pardon
and
something
fit
to
eat
roast
pork
and
onion
stuffing
i
think
and
you
can
tell
him
so
so
the
gaoler
told
the
king
and
the
king
gave
the
page
the
pardon
and
the
pork
and
then
the
page
said
has
a
charmed
life
i
heard
him
tell
the
princess
so
and
what
is
more
he
gave
it
to
her
to
keep
and
she
said
she
hide
it
in
a
safe
place
then
the
king
told
the
eldest
to
watch
and
she
did
watch
and
saw
the
princess
take
florizel
charmed
life
and
hide
it
in
a
bunch
of
jasmine
so
she
took
the
jasmine
and
gave
it
to
the
king
and
he
burnt
it
but
the
princess
had
not
left
the
life
in
the
jasmine
then
they
tried
to
hang
florizel
because
of
course
he
had
an
ordinary
life
as
well
as
a
charmed
one
and
the
king
wished
him
to
be
without
any
life
at
all
thousands
of
people
crowded
to
see
the
presumptuous
hanged
and
the
execution
lasted
the
whole
morning
and
seven
brand
new
ropes
were
wasted
one
after
the
other
and
they
all
left
off
being
ropes
and
turned
into
long
wreaths
of
jasmine
which
broke
into
bits
rather
than
hang
such
a
handsome
the
king
was
furious
but
he
was
not
too
furious
to
see
that
the
princess
must
have
taken
the
charmed
life
out
from
the
jasmine
flowers
and
put
it
somewhere
else
when
the
eldest
lady
was
not
looking
and
it
turned
out
afterwards
that
the
princess
had
held
florizel
life
in
her
hand
all
the
time
the
execution
was
going
on
the
eldest
was
clever
but
she
was
not
so
clever
as
the
princess
the
next
morning
the
eldest
lady
brought
the
princess
silver
mirror
to
the
king
charmed
life
is
in
that
your
majesty
she
said
saw
the
princess
put
it
in
and
so
she
had
but
she
had
not
seen
the
princess
take
it
out
again
almost
directly
afterwards
the
king
smashed
the
and
gave
orders
that
poor
florizel
was
to
be
drowned
in
the
palace
fishpond
so
they
tied
big
stones
to
his
hands
and
feet
and
threw
him
in
and
the
stones
changed
to
corks
and
held
him
up
and
he
swam
to
land
and
when
they
arrested
him
as
he
landed
they
found
that
on
each
of
the
corks
there
was
a
beautiful
painting
of
candida
face
as
she
saw
it
every
morning
in
her
mirror
now
the
king
and
queen
of
bohemia
florizel
father
and
mother
had
gone
to
margate
for
a
fortnight
holiday
will
have
a
thorough
holiday
said
the
king
will
forget
the
world
and
not
even
look
at
a
newspaper
but
on
the
third
day
they
both
got
tired
of
forgetting
the
world
and
each
of
them
secretly
bought
a
newspaper
and
read
it
on
the
beach
and
each
rushed
back
and
met
the
other
on
the
steps
of
the
where
they
were
staying
and
the
queen
began
to
cry
and
the
king
took
her
in
his
arms
on
the
doorstep
to
the
horror
of
the
other
boarders
who
were
looking
out
of
the
windows
at
them
and
then
they
rushed
off
to
the
railway
station
leaving
behind
them
their
luggage
and
the
astonished
boarders
and
took
a
special
train
to
town
because
the
king
had
read
in
his
newspaper
and
the
queen
in
hers
that
the
was
being
executed
every
morning
from
nine
to
twelve
and
though
so
far
none
of
the
executions
had
ended
fatally
yet
at
any
moment
the
charmed
life
might
be
taken
and
then
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
daily
executions
a
very
terrible
end
arrived
at
the
capital
the
poor
queen
of
bohemia
got
into
a
hansom
with
the
king
and
they
were
driven
to
the
palace
the
was
crowded
is
the
matter
the
king
of
bohemia
asked
that
said
a
bystander
with
spectacles
and
a
straw
hat
has
as
many
lives
as
a
cat
they
tried
boiling
oil
this
morning
and
the
oil
turned
into
leaves
and
the
fire
under
it
turned
to
a
bush
and
now
the
king
has
sent
for
princess
candida
and
is
going
to
have
it
out
with
her
the
whole
thing
has
been
most
exciting
should
think
so
said
the
father
course
said
the
bystander
in
spectacles
who
has
read
any
history
knows
that
do
have
charmed
lives
but
our
king
never
would
learn
history
so
he
does
see
that
of
course
the
is
a
prince
disguised
the
question
is
will
he
find
out
in
time
i
ca
think
why
the
does
own
his
princishness
and
have
done
with
it
he
does
know
it
himself
said
the
king
of
bohemia
he
gave
his
arm
to
his
wife
and
they
managed
to
squeeze
through
to
the
great
council
hall
where
the
king
of
that
country
sat
on
his
gold
throne
surrounded
by
judges
in
wigs
and
other
people
in
other
things
florizel
was
there
loaded
with
chains
and
standing
in
a
very
noble
attitude
at
one
corner
of
the
throne
steps
at
the
other
stood
the
princess
looking
across
at
her
lover
with
her
dear
gray
eyes
said
the
king
am
tired
of
diplomacy
and
tact
and
the
eldest
is
less
of
a
sherlock
holmes
than
i
thought
her
so
let
us
be
straightforward
and
honest
have
you
got
a
charmed
life
have
exactly
got
it
said
florizel
life
is
not
my
own
now
he
give
it
to
you
the
king
asked
his
daughter
can
not
tell
a
lie
father
said
the
princess
just
as
though
her
name
had
been
george
washington
instead
of
candida
did
give
it
to
me
have
you
done
with
it
have
hidden
it
in
different
places
i
have
saved
it
he
saved
mine
once
is
it
asked
her
father
you
so
justly
observe
you
can
not
tell
a
lie
i
tell
you
said
the
princess
you
give
your
royal
word
that
the
execution
you
have
ordered
for
this
morning
shall
be
really
the
last
you
can
destroy
the
object
that
i
have
hidden
his
charmed
life
in
and
then
you
can
destroy
him
but
you
must
promise
me
not
to
ask
me
to
hide
his
life
in
any
new
place
because
i
am
tired
of
all
the
judges
and
and
people
felt
really
sorry
for
the
princess
for
they
thought
all
these
executions
had
turned
her
brain
give
you
my
royal
word
said
the
king
upon
his
throne
wo
ask
you
to
hide
his
life
any
more
indeed
i
was
against
the
practice
from
the
first
now
where
have
you
hidden
his
life
my
heart
said
the
princess
brave
and
clear
so
that
everyone
heard
her
in
the
big
hall
ca
take
his
life
without
taking
mine
and
if
you
take
mine
you
may
as
well
take
his
for
he
wo
care
to
go
on
living
without
me
she
sprang
across
the
throne
steps
to
florizel
and
his
fetters
jangled
as
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
me
said
the
king
rubbing
his
nose
with
his
sceptre
is
very
awkward
the
princess
laughed
happily
my
clever
princess
whispered
florizel
as
clever
as
you
dear
and
as
dear
as
you
beautiful
there
was
a
silence
really
said
the
king
do
quite
see
the
father
and
mother
of
florizel
had
wriggled
and
wormed
their
way
through
the
crowd
to
a
front
place
and
now
the
father
spoke
majesty
allow
me
perhaps
i
can
assist
your
decision
all
right
said
the
king
upon
his
throne
ahead
i
struck
all
of
a
heap
see
before
you
said
the
king
of
bohemia
known
to
the
world
of
science
and
of
business
as
bloomsbury
inventor
and
patenter
of
many
mechanical
novelties
among
others
the
patent
lightning
lift
now
formed
into
a
company
of
which
i
am
the
chairman
the
young
whose
fetters
are
most
clumsily
designed
if
you
will
pardon
my
saying
so
is
my
son
course
he
somebody
son
said
the
king
upon
his
throne
he
happens
to
be
mine
and
i
gather
that
you
do
not
think
him
a
good
enough
match
for
your
daughter
wishing
to
hurt
your
feelings
began
candida
father
well
know
o
king
on
your
throne
and
everyone
else
that
this
young
is
no
other
than
florizel
prince
of
bohemia
i
am
the
king
of
bohemia
and
this
is
my
queen
as
he
spoke
he
took
his
crown
out
of
his
pocket
and
put
it
on
his
wife
took
off
her
bonnet
and
got
her
crown
out
of
her
reticule
and
put
that
on
and
florizel
crown
was
handed
to
the
princess
who
fitted
it
on
for
him
because
his
hands
were
awkward
with
chains
most
convincing
explanation
alters
everything
said
the
king
upon
his
throne
and
he
came
down
to
meet
the
visitors
you
my
children
strike
off
his
chains
ca
you
i
hope
there
no
florizel
he
added
turning
to
the
prince
see
an
engineer
is
only
an
engineer
whereas
a
prince
is
a
prince
be
he
never
so
disinherited
will
half
an
hour
from
now
suit
you
for
the
wedding
so
they
were
married
and
they
still
live
very
happily
they
will
live
as
long
as
is
good
for
them
and
when
candida
dies
florizel
will
die
too
because
she
still
carries
his
life
in
her
heart
billy
the
king
william
said
billy
king
are
old
enough
to
earn
your
own
living
so
i
shall
find
you
a
nice
situation
in
an
office
and
you
will
not
return
to
school
the
blood
of
billy
king
ran
cold
in
his
veins
he
looked
out
over
the
brown
wire
blinds
into
claremont
square
pentonville
which
was
where
his
uncle
lived
and
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
for
though
his
uncle
thought
he
was
old
enough
to
earn
his
own
living
he
was
still
young
enough
to
hate
the
idea
of
having
to
earn
it
in
an
office
where
he
would
never
do
anything
or
make
anything
or
see
anything
but
only
add
up
dull
figures
from
year
end
to
year
end
do
care
said
billy
to
himself
run
away
and
get
a
situation
on
my
own
something
interesting
i
wonder
if
i
could
learn
how
to
be
a
pirate
captain
or
a
highwayman
and
next
morning
billy
got
up
very
early
before
anyone
was
about
and
ran
away
he
ran
till
he
was
out
of
breath
and
then
he
walked
and
he
walked
till
he
was
out
of
patience
and
then
he
ran
again
and
between
walking
and
running
he
came
at
last
plump
up
to
the
door
of
a
shop
and
over
the
shop
there
were
big
painted
letters
saying
office
for
all
sorts
of
persons
out
of
employment
out
of
employment
anyway
said
he
the
window
of
the
shop
had
big
sort
of
things
in
them
with
white
cards
fastened
on
to
them
with
and
on
the
cards
were
written
the
kind
of
persons
out
of
employment
the
registry
office
had
got
places
for
and
in
the
very
first
one
he
read
there
was
his
own
name
king
come
to
the
right
shop
said
billy
and
he
read
the
card
through
general
king
wanted
must
be
used
to
the
business
not
me
i
afraid
thought
billy
whatever
a
general
king
business
is
i
ca
be
used
to
it
till
i
tried
it
the
next
was
steady
king
wanted
must
be
quick
willing
and
up
to
his
work
willing
enough
said
billy
i
quick
enough
at
any
rate
at
fives
or
footer
but
i
do
know
what
a
steady
king
work
is
so
he
looked
at
another
card
respectable
king
to
take
entire
charge
of
parliament
and
to
assist
in
cabinet
councils
and
reform
of
the
army
to
open
bazaars
and
schools
of
art
and
make
himself
generally
useful
billy
shook
his
head
think
that
must
be
a
very
hard
place
said
he
the
next
was
queen
wanted
economical
and
good
manager
else
i
am
i
not
a
queen
said
billy
and
he
was
just
turning
sadly
away
when
he
saw
a
little
card
stuck
away
in
the
top
corner
of
the
baize
field
king
wanted
no
objection
to
one
who
has
not
been
out
before
can
but
try
said
billy
and
he
opened
the
door
of
the
registry
office
and
walked
in
inside
there
were
several
desks
at
the
first
desk
a
lion
with
a
pen
behind
its
ear
was
dictating
to
a
unicorn
who
was
writing
in
a
series
of
with
his
horn
billy
noticed
that
the
horn
had
been
sharpened
to
a
nice
point
like
a
lead
pencil
when
the
does
it
for
you
as
a
favour
think
you
want
a
king
said
billy
timidly
we
do
said
the
lion
and
it
turned
on
him
so
quickly
that
billy
was
sorry
he
had
spoken
situation
is
filled
young
man
and
we
thoroughly
suited
billy
was
turning
away
much
dispirited
when
the
unicorn
said
some
of
the
others
so
he
went
on
to
the
next
desk
where
a
frog
sat
sadly
but
it
only
wanted
presidents
and
at
the
next
desk
an
eagle
told
him
that
only
emperors
were
wanted
and
those
very
seldom
it
was
not
till
he
got
to
the
very
end
of
the
long
room
that
billy
found
a
desk
where
a
fat
pig
in
spectacles
sat
reading
a
you
want
a
king
said
billy
not
been
out
before
you
the
king
for
us
said
the
pig
shutting
the
with
a
bang
i
suppose
as
the
notice
says
think
i
should
be
said
billy
adding
honestly
if
i
liked
the
work
the
pig
gave
him
a
square
of
silver
parchment
and
said
the
address
on
the
parchment
was
written
of
plurimiregia
billy
king
respectable
monarch
not
been
out
before
better
go
by
post
said
the
pig
five
post
will
do
why
but
how
where
is
it
asked
billy
do
know
where
it
is
said
the
pig
the
knows
everything
as
to
how
why
you
just
tie
a
label
round
your
neck
and
post
yourself
in
the
nearest
as
to
why
that
a
silly
question
really
your
majesty
do
you
know
the
always
takes
charge
of
the
royal
males
billy
was
just
putting
the
address
carefully
away
in
what
would
have
been
his
if
he
had
had
any
relation
in
the
world
except
a
when
the
swing
door
opened
gently
and
a
little
girl
came
in
she
looked
at
the
lion
and
unicorn
and
the
other
busy
beasts
behind
their
desks
and
she
did
not
seem
to
like
the
look
of
them
she
looked
up
the
long
room
and
she
saw
billy
and
she
came
straight
up
to
him
and
said
i
want
a
situation
as
queen
it
says
in
the
window
previous
experience
not
required
she
was
a
very
shabby
little
girl
with
a
clean
round
rosy
face
and
she
looked
as
little
like
a
queen
with
previous
experience
as
anybody
could
possibly
have
done
not
the
registry
office
my
good
kid
said
billy
and
the
pig
said
the
next
desk
behind
the
next
desk
sat
a
lizard
but
it
was
so
large
it
was
more
like
an
alligator
only
with
a
less
unpleasant
expression
about
the
mouth
to
him
said
the
pig
as
the
lizard
leaned
forward
on
his
front
paws
like
a
draper
assistant
when
he
says
the
next
article
do
like
to
said
the
little
girl
you
little
duffer
said
billy
kindly
wo
eat
you
you
sure
said
the
little
girl
very
earnestly
then
billy
said
here
i
a
king
and
so
i
got
a
situation
are
you
a
queen
name
eliza
macqueen
said
the
little
girl
suppose
that
near
enough
then
said
billy
to
the
lizard
she
do
i
should
say
replied
the
lizard
with
a
smile
that
did
not
become
him
very
well
is
the
address
he
gave
it
to
her
it
read
of
allexanassa
queen
not
been
out
before
willing
obliging
and
anxious
to
learn
kingdoms
he
added
next
door
to
each
other
we
shall
see
each
other
often
said
billy
up
we
might
travel
together
perhaps
said
the
pig
go
by
railway
a
queen
has
to
begin
to
get
used
to
her
train
as
soon
as
she
can
now
run
along
do
my
friend
here
will
see
her
off
sure
they
wo
eat
me
said
eliza
and
billy
was
certain
they
would
though
he
did
know
why
so
he
said
i
hope
you
get
on
in
your
new
place
and
off
he
went
to
buy
a
penny
luggage
label
at
the
expensive
stationer
three
doors
down
the
street
on
the
side
and
when
he
had
addressed
the
label
and
tied
it
round
his
neck
he
posted
himself
honourably
at
the
general
the
rest
of
the
letters
in
the
box
made
a
fairly
comfortable
bed
and
billy
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
was
being
delivered
by
the
early
morning
postman
at
the
houses
of
parliament
in
the
capital
of
plurimiregia
and
the
houses
of
parliament
were
just
being
opened
for
the
day
the
air
of
plurimiregia
was
clear
and
blue
very
different
from
the
air
of
claremont
square
pentonville
the
hills
and
woods
round
the
town
looked
soft
and
green
from
the
hill
in
the
middle
of
the
town
where
the
parliament
houses
stood
the
town
itself
was
small
and
very
pretty
like
one
of
the
towns
in
old
illuminated
books
and
it
had
a
great
wall
all
round
it
and
orange
trees
growing
on
the
wall
billy
wondered
whether
it
was
forbidden
to
pick
the
oranges
when
parliament
was
opened
by
the
footman
whose
business
it
was
billy
said
i
come
about
the
place
king
or
the
cook
asked
the
footman
billy
was
rather
angry
do
i
look
like
a
cook
he
said
question
is
do
you
look
like
a
king
said
the
footman
i
get
the
place
you
will
be
sorry
for
this
said
billy
you
get
the
place
you
wo
keep
it
long
said
the
footman
not
worth
while
being
disagreeable
there
not
time
to
do
it
properly
in
come
along
in
billy
went
along
in
and
the
footman
led
him
into
the
presence
of
the
prime
minister
who
was
sitting
with
straws
in
his
hair
wringing
his
hands
illustration
come
by
post
your
lordship
said
the
footman
page
by
post
your
lordship
the
footman
said
london
the
prime
minister
left
off
wringing
his
hands
and
held
one
of
them
out
to
billy
will
suit
he
said
engage
you
in
a
minute
but
just
pull
the
straws
out
of
my
hair
first
will
you
i
only
put
them
in
because
we
had
been
able
to
find
a
suitable
king
and
i
find
straws
so
useful
in
helping
my
brain
to
act
in
a
crisis
of
course
once
engaged
for
the
situation
no
one
will
ask
you
to
do
anything
useful
billy
pulled
the
straws
out
and
the
prime
minister
said
they
all
out
thanks
well
now
you
engaged
six
months
on
trial
you
need
do
anything
you
do
want
to
now
your
majesty
breakfast
is
served
at
nine
let
me
conduct
you
to
the
royal
apartments
in
ten
minutes
billy
had
come
out
of
a
silver
bath
filled
with
scented
water
and
was
putting
on
the
grandest
clothes
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
everything
was
of
thick
soft
pussy
silk
and
his
boots
had
gold
heels
with
gold
spurs
on
them
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
was
with
personal
pleasure
and
not
from
a
sense
of
duty
that
he
brushed
his
hair
and
satisfied
himself
that
none
of
his
nails
were
in
mourning
then
he
went
to
breakfast
which
was
so
fine
that
none
but
a
french
cook
could
have
either
cooked
or
described
it
he
was
a
little
hungry
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
the
bread
and
cheese
at
supper
in
claremont
square
the
night
before
last
after
breakfast
he
rode
out
on
a
white
pony
a
thing
he
might
have
lived
in
claremont
square
for
ever
without
doing
and
he
found
he
rode
very
well
after
the
ride
he
went
on
the
sea
in
a
boat
and
was
surprised
and
delighted
to
find
that
he
knew
how
to
sail
as
well
as
how
to
steer
in
the
afternoon
he
was
taken
to
a
circus
and
in
the
evening
the
whole
court
played
buff
a
most
enchanting
day
next
morning
the
breakfast
was
boiled
underdone
eggs
and
burnt
herrings
the
king
was
too
polite
to
make
remarks
about
his
food
but
he
did
feel
a
little
disappointed
the
prime
minister
was
late
for
breakfast
and
came
in
looking
hot
and
flurried
and
a
garland
of
straw
was
entwined
in
the
prime
ministerial
hair
my
hair
sire
he
said
cook
left
last
night
but
a
new
one
comes
at
noon
meantime
i
have
done
my
best
illustration
excuse
my
hair
sire
he
said
page
billy
said
it
was
all
right
and
he
had
had
an
excellent
breakfast
the
second
day
passed
as
happily
as
the
first
the
cook
seemed
to
have
arrived
for
the
breakfast
was
made
up
for
by
the
lunch
and
billy
had
the
pleasure
of
shooting
at
a
target
at
two
thousand
yards
with
the
rifle
which
had
arrived
by
the
same
post
as
himself
and
hitting
the
every
time
this
is
really
a
rare
thing
even
when
you
are
a
king
but
billy
began
to
think
it
curious
that
he
should
never
have
found
out
before
how
clever
he
was
and
when
he
took
down
a
volume
of
virgil
and
found
that
he
could
read
it
as
easily
as
though
it
had
been
the
first
he
was
really
astonished
so
billy
said
to
the
prime
minister
is
it
i
know
so
many
things
without
learning
them
the
rule
here
sire
said
the
prime
minister
are
allowed
to
know
everything
without
learning
it
now
the
next
morning
billy
woke
very
early
and
got
up
and
went
out
into
the
garden
and
turning
a
corner
suddenly
he
came
upon
a
little
person
in
a
large
white
cap
with
a
large
white
apron
on
in
which
she
was
gathering
sweet
thyme
and
basil
and
mint
and
savory
and
sage
and
marjoram
she
stood
up
and
dropped
a
curtsy
said
billy
the
king
are
you
the
new
cook
said
the
person
in
the
apron
her
big
flapping
cap
hid
her
face
but
billy
knew
her
voice
said
he
turning
her
face
up
with
his
hands
under
her
chin
eliza
and
sure
enough
it
was
eliza
but
her
round
face
looked
very
much
cleverer
and
prettier
than
it
had
done
when
he
saw
it
last
she
said
i
am
i
got
the
place
as
queen
of
allexanassa
but
it
was
all
horribly
grand
and
such
long
trains
and
the
crown
is
awfully
heavy
and
yesterday
morning
i
woke
very
early
and
i
thought
i
just
put
on
my
old
frock
mother
made
it
for
me
the
very
last
thing
before
she
was
taken
cry
said
billy
the
king
gently
i
went
out
and
there
was
a
man
with
a
boat
and
he
did
know
i
was
the
queen
and
i
got
him
to
take
me
for
a
row
on
the
sea
and
he
told
me
some
things
sort
of
things
about
us
billy
i
suppose
you
the
same
as
i
am
now
and
know
everything
without
learning
it
what
allexanassa
greek
for
something
like
the
country
of
changing
queens
is
it
what
does
plurimiregia
mean
must
mean
the
land
of
many
kings
why
that
what
it
is
they
always
changing
their
kings
and
queens
here
for
a
most
horrid
and
frightening
reason
billy
they
get
them
from
a
registry
office
a
long
way
off
so
that
they
should
know
billy
there
a
dreadful
dragon
and
he
comes
once
a
month
to
be
fed
and
they
feed
him
with
kings
and
queens
that
why
we
know
everything
without
learning
because
there
no
time
to
learn
in
and
the
dragon
has
two
heads
billy
a
pig
head
and
a
lizard
head
and
the
head
is
to
eat
with
and
the
lizard
head
will
eat
they
brought
us
here
for
that
said
billy
cruel
cowardly
brutes
always
said
you
could
never
tell
what
a
situation
was
like
until
you
tried
it
said
eliza
what
are
we
to
do
the
dragon
comes
when
i
heard
that
i
asked
where
your
kingdom
was
and
the
boatman
showed
me
and
i
made
him
land
me
here
so
allexanassa
got
a
queen
now
but
plurimiregia
has
got
us
both
billy
rumpled
his
hair
with
his
hands
my
cats
alive
he
said
must
do
something
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
eliza
you
no
end
of
a
brick
to
come
and
tell
me
you
might
have
got
off
all
by
yourself
and
left
me
to
the
pig
head
i
might
said
eliza
sharply
know
everything
that
people
can
learn
the
same
as
you
and
that
includes
right
and
wrong
so
you
see
i
true
i
wonder
whether
our
being
clever
would
help
us
take
a
boat
and
steer
straight
out
and
take
our
chance
i
can
sail
and
steer
beautifully
can
i
said
eliza
disdainfully
you
see
it
too
late
for
that
hours
before
the
beast
comes
the
runs
away
and
great
waves
of
thick
treacle
come
sweeping
round
the
kingdoms
no
boat
can
live
in
such
a
sea
but
how
does
the
dragon
get
here
is
he
on
the
island
said
eliza
squeezing
up
handfuls
of
herbs
in
her
agitation
till
the
scent
quite
overpowered
the
scent
of
the
honeysuckle
he
comes
out
of
the
sea
but
he
is
very
hot
inside
and
he
melts
the
treacle
so
that
it
gets
quite
thin
like
when
it
runs
out
of
a
and
so
he
can
swim
in
it
and
he
comes
along
to
the
quay
and
is
fed
with
billy
shuddered
wish
we
were
back
in
claremont
square
said
he
do
i
i
sure
said
eliza
i
do
know
where
it
is
nor
yet
want
to
know
said
billy
suddenly
hear
a
rustling
it
the
prime
minister
and
i
can
hear
he
got
straws
in
his
hair
again
most
likely
because
you
disappeared
and
he
thinks
he
will
have
to
cook
the
breakfast
meet
me
beside
the
lighthouse
at
four
this
afternoon
hide
in
this
and
do
come
out
till
the
coast
clear
he
ran
out
and
took
the
prime
minister
arm
is
the
straw
for
now
a
bad
habit
said
the
prime
minister
wearily
then
billy
suddenly
saw
and
he
said
a
beastly
mean
cowardly
sneak
and
you
feel
it
that
what
the
straws
are
about
majesty
said
the
prime
minister
feebly
said
billy
firmly
know
you
are
now
i
know
all
the
laws
of
plurimiregia
and
i
going
to
abdicate
this
morning
and
the
next
in
rank
has
to
be
king
if
he
ca
engage
a
fresh
one
you
next
in
rank
to
me
so
by
the
time
the
dragon
comes
you
be
the
king
i
attend
your
coronation
the
prime
minister
gasped
did
you
find
out
and
turned
the
colour
of
unripe
peaches
tellings
said
billy
you
had
all
been
such
sneaks
i
expect
heaps
of
your
kings
had
sense
enough
to
have
got
rid
of
the
dragon
for
you
only
i
suppose
you
never
told
them
in
time
now
look
here
i
do
want
you
to
do
anything
except
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
let
there
be
a
boat
and
no
boatman
on
the
beach
under
the
lighthouse
at
four
the
sea
all
treacle
illustration
speak
to
the
dragon
as
soon
as
it
arrives
page
said
on
the
beach
not
on
the
sea
my
good
straw
merchant
and
what
i
say
you
jolly
well
got
to
do
you
must
be
there
and
no
one
else
if
you
tell
a
soul
i
abdicate
and
where
will
you
be
then
do
know
said
the
wretched
prime
minister
stooping
to
gather
some
more
straws
from
the
strawberry
bed
i
do
said
billy
for
breakfast
before
four
that
afternoon
the
prime
minister
head
was
a
perfect
of
straws
but
he
met
billy
at
the
appointed
place
and
there
was
a
boat
and
also
eliza
billy
carried
his
a
wind
blew
from
the
shore
and
the
straws
in
the
prime
minister
hair
rustled
like
a
in
august
said
billy
the
king
royal
majesty
commands
you
to
speak
to
the
dragon
as
soon
as
it
arrives
and
to
say
that
your
king
has
abdicated
he
has
said
the
prime
minister
in
tears
he
so
you
wo
be
telling
a
lie
i
abdicate
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
turn
king
again
as
soon
as
i
tried
my
little
plan
i
shall
be
quite
in
time
to
meet
my
fate
and
the
dragon
say
the
king
has
abdicated
you
better
just
look
in
at
allexanassa
and
get
the
queen
and
when
you
call
again
i
have
a
nice
fat
king
all
ready
for
you
the
straws
trembled
and
eliza
sobbed
billy
went
on
and
he
had
never
felt
so
truly
regal
as
now
when
he
was
preparing
to
risk
his
life
in
order
to
save
his
subjects
from
the
monthly
temptation
to
be
mean
and
cowardly
and
sneakish
i
think
myself
it
was
good
of
billy
he
might
just
have
abdicated
and
let
things
slide
some
boys
would
have
the
sea
of
treacle
heaved
and
swelled
sulkily
against
the
beach
the
prime
minister
said
well
i
do
it
but
i
sooner
die
than
see
my
king
false
to
his
word
wo
have
to
choose
between
the
two
said
billy
very
pale
but
determined
king
not
a
hound
like
like
and
then
far
away
on
the
very
edge
of
the
green
treacly
sea
they
saw
a
squirming
and
a
squelching
and
clouds
of
steam
and
all
sorts
of
exciting
and
unpleasant
things
happening
very
suddenly
and
all
together
the
prime
minister
covered
his
head
with
dry
seaweed
and
said
him
corrected
eliza
the
queen
and
billy
the
king
in
one
breath
but
the
prime
minister
was
long
past
any
proper
pride
in
his
grammar
and
then
cutting
its
way
through
the
thick
sticky
waves
of
the
treacle
sea
came
the
hot
dragon
melting
a
way
for
himself
as
he
came
and
he
got
nearer
and
nearer
and
bigger
and
bigger
and
at
last
he
came
close
to
the
beach
snouting
and
snorting
and
opened
two
great
mouths
in
an
expecting
hungry
sort
of
way
and
when
he
found
he
was
not
being
fed
the
expression
of
the
mouths
changed
to
an
angry
and
surprised
question
and
one
mouth
was
a
pig
mouth
and
one
was
a
lizard
billy
the
king
borrowed
a
pin
from
eliza
the
queen
to
stick
into
the
prime
minister
who
was
by
this
time
nearly
buried
in
the
seaweed
which
he
had
been
trying
to
arrange
in
his
hair
up
silly
said
his
majesty
the
prime
minister
spoke
up
sir
he
said
to
the
dragon
king
has
abdicated
so
we
nothing
for
you
just
now
but
if
you
could
just
run
over
to
allexanassa
and
pick
up
their
queen
we
have
a
nice
fat
king
ready
for
you
if
you
call
on
your
way
home
the
prime
minister
shuddered
as
he
spoke
he
happened
to
be
very
fat
the
dragon
did
not
say
a
word
he
nodded
with
both
his
heads
and
grunted
with
both
his
mouths
and
turned
his
one
tail
and
swam
away
along
the
track
of
thin
warm
treacle
which
he
had
made
in
swimming
across
the
sea
quick
as
thought
billy
the
king
signed
to
the
prime
minister
and
to
eliza
and
they
launched
the
boat
billy
sprang
on
board
and
pushed
off
and
it
was
not
till
the
boat
was
a
dozen
yards
from
shore
that
he
turned
to
wave
a
farewell
to
eliza
and
the
prime
minister
the
latter
was
indeed
still
on
the
beach
searching
hopefully
among
the
drifts
and
weeds
for
more
straws
to
mark
his
sense
of
the
constitutional
crisis
but
eliza
had
disappeared
dear
oh
dear
said
billy
the
king
that
brute
of
a
prime
minister
ca
have
killed
her
right
off
so
as
to
have
her
ready
for
the
dragon
when
he
comes
back
oh
my
dear
little
eliza
here
said
a
thick
voice
and
sure
enough
there
was
eliza
holding
on
to
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
and
swimming
heavily
in
the
warm
treacle
nearly
choked
with
it
too
for
she
had
been
under
more
than
once
billy
hastened
to
haul
her
aboard
and
though
she
was
quite
brown
and
very
very
sticky
the
moment
she
was
safe
in
the
boat
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
and
said
darling
eliza
you
the
dearest
bravest
girl
in
the
world
if
we
ever
get
out
of
this
you
marry
me
wo
you
there
no
one
in
the
world
like
you
say
you
will
course
i
will
said
eliza
still
spluttering
through
the
treacle
no
one
in
the
world
like
you
either
then
if
that
so
you
steer
and
i
sail
and
we
get
the
better
of
the
beast
yet
said
billy
and
he
set
the
sail
and
eliza
steered
as
well
as
she
could
in
her
treacly
state
about
the
middle
of
the
channel
they
caught
up
with
the
dragon
billy
took
up
his
and
fired
its
eight
bullets
straight
into
the
dragon
side
you
have
no
idea
how
the
fire
spurted
out
through
the
but
the
wind
from
shore
had
caught
the
sails
and
the
boat
was
now
going
very
much
faster
than
the
dragon
who
found
the
annoying
and
had
slowed
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
you
dear
brave
eliza
said
billy
the
king
all
right
anyhow
and
holding
his
reloaded
rifle
high
over
his
head
he
plunged
into
the
treacly
sea
and
swam
back
towards
the
dragon
it
is
very
difficult
to
shoot
straight
when
you
are
swimming
especially
in
nearly
boiling
treacle
but
his
majesty
king
billy
managed
to
do
it
he
sent
his
eight
bullets
straight
into
the
dragon
heads
and
the
huge
monster
writhed
and
wriggled
and
squirmed
and
squawked
all
over
the
sea
from
end
to
end
till
at
last
it
floated
lifeless
on
the
surface
of
the
clear
warm
treacle
and
stretched
its
wicked
paws
out
and
shut
its
wicked
eyes
all
four
of
them
and
died
the
lizard
eyes
shut
last
then
billy
began
to
swim
for
dear
life
towards
the
shore
of
plurimiregia
and
the
treacle
was
so
hot
that
if
he
had
been
a
king
he
would
have
been
boiled
but
now
that
the
dreadful
dragon
was
cold
in
death
there
was
nothing
to
keep
the
treacle
sea
thin
and
warm
and
it
began
to
thicken
so
fast
that
swimming
was
very
difficult
indeed
if
you
do
understand
this
you
need
only
ask
the
attendants
at
your
nearest
to
fill
the
baths
with
treacle
instead
of
water
and
you
will
very
soon
comprehend
how
it
was
that
billy
reached
the
shore
of
his
kingdom
quite
exhausted
and
almost
speechless
the
prime
minister
was
there
he
had
fetched
a
whole
truss
of
straw
when
he
thought
billy
plan
had
failed
and
that
the
dragon
would
eat
him
as
the
next
in
rank
and
he
wanted
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
and
when
he
warmly
embraced
the
treacly
king
billy
became
so
covered
with
straws
that
he
hardly
knew
himself
he
pulled
himself
together
however
enough
to
withdraw
his
resignation
and
then
looked
out
over
the
sea
in
lay
the
dead
dragon
and
far
in
the
distance
he
could
see
the
white
sails
of
the
boat
nearing
the
shores
of
allexanassa
what
are
we
to
do
now
asked
the
prime
minister
a
bath
said
the
king
dragon
dead
and
i
fetch
eliza
in
the
morning
they
wo
hurt
her
over
there
now
the
dragon
killed
wo
hurt
her
said
the
prime
minister
the
treacle
allexanassa
is
an
island
the
dragon
brought
the
treacle
up
by
his
enchantments
and
now
there
is
no
one
to
take
it
away
again
never
get
a
boat
to
live
in
a
sea
like
that
never
i
said
billy
cleverer
than
you
but
all
the
same
he
did
quite
see
his
way
to
sailing
a
boat
in
that
sea
and
with
a
sad
and
aching
heart
he
went
back
to
the
palace
to
the
silver
bath
the
treacle
and
straws
took
hours
to
wash
off
and
after
that
he
was
so
tired
that
he
did
not
want
any
supper
which
was
just
as
well
because
there
was
no
one
to
cook
it
tired
as
he
was
billy
slept
very
badly
he
woke
up
again
and
again
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
his
brave
little
friend
and
to
wish
that
he
could
have
done
something
to
prevent
her
being
carried
away
in
that
boat
but
think
as
he
might
he
failed
to
see
that
he
could
have
done
any
differently
and
his
heart
sank
for
in
spite
of
his
bold
words
to
the
prime
minister
he
had
no
more
idea
than
you
have
how
to
cross
the
sea
of
thick
treacle
that
lay
between
his
kingdom
and
allexanassa
he
invented
steamships
with
screws
and
all
through
his
dreams
and
when
he
got
up
in
the
morning
he
looked
out
of
his
window
on
the
dark
sea
and
longed
for
a
good
gray
foamy
salt
tumbling
sea
like
we
have
at
home
in
england
no
matter
how
high
the
waves
and
the
winds
might
be
but
the
wind
had
fallen
and
the
dark
brown
sea
looked
strangely
calm
illustration
two
skated
into
each
other
arms
page
hastily
snatching
a
dozen
peaches
out
of
the
palace
garden
by
way
of
breakfast
billy
the
king
hurried
to
the
beach
by
the
lighthouse
no
heaving
of
the
treacle
sea
broke
the
smooth
line
of
it
against
the
beach
billy
looked
looked
again
swallowed
the
last
peach
stone
and
all
and
tore
back
to
the
town
he
rushed
into
the
chief
ironmonger
and
bought
a
pair
of
skates
and
a
gimlet
in
less
time
than
i
can
write
it
he
had
scurried
back
to
the
beach
bored
holes
in
his
gold
heels
fastened
on
the
skates
and
was
skating
away
over
the
brown
sea
towards
allexanassa
for
the
treacle
heated
to
by
the
passing
of
the
dragon
had
now
grown
cold
and
of
course
it
was
now
far
off
eliza
had
had
the
same
idea
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
toffee
and
of
course
as
queen
of
allexanassa
she
could
skate
beautifully
so
the
two
skated
into
each
other
arms
somewhere
near
the
middle
of
the
channel
between
the
two
islands
they
stood
telling
each
other
how
happy
they
were
for
a
few
moments
or
it
may
have
been
a
few
hours
and
when
they
turned
to
go
back
to
plurimiregia
they
found
that
the
of
the
treacle
sea
was
black
with
crowds
of
skaters
for
the
allexanassians
and
the
plurimiregians
had
found
out
the
wonderful
truth
and
were
hurrying
across
to
pay
visits
to
their
friends
and
relations
in
the
opposite
islands
near
the
shore
the
toffee
was
hidden
by
troops
of
children
who
had
borrowed
the
family
hammers
and
were
chipping
into
the
solid
toffee
and
eating
the
flakes
of
it
as
they
splintered
off
people
were
pointing
out
to
each
other
the
spot
where
the
dragon
had
sunk
and
when
they
perceived
billy
the
king
and
eliza
the
queen
they
sent
up
a
shout
that
you
could
have
heard
miles
out
at
sea
if
there
had
been
any
sea
which
of
course
there
was
the
prime
minister
had
lost
no
time
in
issuing
a
proclamation
setting
forth
billy
splendid
conduct
in
ridding
the
country
of
the
dragon
and
all
the
populace
were
in
a
frenzy
of
gratitude
and
loyalty
billy
turned
on
a
little
tap
inside
his
head
by
some
means
which
i
can
not
describe
to
you
and
a
bright
flood
of
cleverness
poured
through
his
brain
all
he
said
to
eliza
were
going
to
give
us
to
the
dragon
to
save
their
own
lives
it
bad
i
know
but
i
do
know
that
it
worse
than
people
who
let
other
people
die
of
because
they
want
a
particular
glaze
on
their
or
let
people
die
of
so
that
they
may
get
matches
at
six
boxes
a
penny
we
as
well
off
here
as
in
england
said
eliza
so
they
agreed
to
stay
and
go
on
being
king
and
queen
on
condition
that
the
prime
minister
consented
to
give
up
straws
altogether
even
in
moments
of
crisis
will
your
majesties
he
said
adding
with
a
polite
bow
shall
not
need
a
single
straw
under
your
majesty
able
kingship
and
all
the
people
cheered
like
mad
eliza
and
billy
were
married
in
due
course
the
kingdoms
are
now
extremely
happy
both
are
governed
by
billy
who
is
a
very
good
king
because
he
knows
so
much
eliza
got
him
to
change
the
law
about
queens
knowing
everything
because
she
wanted
her
husband
to
be
cleverer
than
she
was
but
billy
did
want
to
make
laws
to
turn
his
eliza
stupid
so
he
just
changed
the
law
only
a
little
bit
so
that
the
king
knows
everything
a
man
ought
to
know
and
the
queen
knows
everything
that
ought
to
be
known
by
a
woman
so
that
all
right
exploring
expeditions
were
fitted
out
to
find
the
edge
of
the
toffee
it
was
found
to
stand
up
in
cliffs
two
hundred
feet
high
overhanging
the
real
live
sea
the
king
had
ships
built
at
once
to
sail
on
the
real
sea
and
carry
merchandise
to
other
lands
and
so
allexanassa
and
plurimiregia
grew
richer
and
richer
every
day
the
merchandise
of
course
is
toffee
and
half
the
men
in
the
kingdoms
work
in
the
great
all
the
toffee
you
buy
in
shops
comes
from
there
and
the
reason
why
some
of
the
cheaper
kinds
you
buy
are
so
gritty
is
i
need
hardly
say
because
the
will
not
remember
before
they
go
down
into
the
mines
to
wipe
their
muddy
boots
on
the
doormats
provided
by
billy
the
king
with
the
royal
arms
in
seven
colours
on
the
middle
of
each
mat
the
princess
and
the
cat
the
day
when
everything
began
to
happen
to
the
princess
began
just
like
all
her
ordinary
days
the
sun
was
shining
the
birds
were
singing
and
the
princess
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
into
the
nursery
to
let
the
mice
out
of
the
traps
in
the
nursery
cupboard
the
traps
were
set
every
night
with
a
little
bit
of
cheese
in
each
and
every
morning
nurse
found
that
not
a
single
trap
had
caught
a
single
mouse
this
was
because
the
princess
always
let
them
go
no
one
knew
this
except
the
princess
and
of
course
the
mice
themselves
and
the
mice
never
forgot
it
then
came
bath
and
breakfast
and
then
the
princess
ran
to
the
open
window
and
threw
out
the
crumbs
to
the
birds
that
flew
down
fluttering
and
chirping
into
the
marble
terrace
before
lessons
began
she
had
an
hour
for
playing
in
the
garden
but
she
never
began
to
play
till
she
had
been
round
to
see
if
any
rabbits
or
moles
were
caught
in
the
traps
the
palace
gardeners
set
the
gardeners
were
lazy
and
seldom
got
to
work
before
eight
so
she
always
had
plenty
of
time
for
this
then
came
lessons
with
dear
old
professor
ouatidontnoisuntwuthnoing
and
then
more
play
and
dinner
and
needlework
and
play
again
and
now
it
was
teatime
up
your
your
highness
said
nurse
then
you
shall
have
some
nice
plummy
cake
do
feel
at
all
somehow
said
the
princess
feel
just
exactly
as
if
something
was
going
to
happen
always
happening
said
nurse
but
i
mean
something
horrid
said
the
princess
expect
going
to
make
some
nasty
new
law
about
me
last
time
it
was
the
princess
is
only
to
wear
a
white
frock
on
the
first
sunday
in
the
month
he
said
it
was
economy
but
i
know
it
was
only
spite
must
say
that
dear
said
nurse
know
your
rosy
and
bluey
frocks
are
just
as
pretty
as
the
white
but
in
her
heart
she
agreed
with
the
princess
everilda
the
princess
father
and
mother
had
died
when
she
was
quite
little
and
her
uncle
was
regent
now
you
will
have
noticed
that
there
is
something
about
uncles
which
makes
it
impossible
for
them
to
be
good
in
fairy
stories
so
of
course
this
uncle
was
bad
as
bad
as
he
could
be
and
everyone
hated
him
in
fact
though
it
was
now
as
i
have
said
everybody
teatime
nobody
was
making
any
tea
instead
they
were
making
a
revolution
and
just
as
the
princess
was
looking
at
the
hole
left
by
her
first
bite
into
her
first
piece
of
the
good
professor
burst
into
the
nursery
with
his
great
gray
wig
all
on
one
side
crying
out
in
a
very
loud
and
very
choky
voice
revolution
it
come
at
last
i
the
people
would
never
stand
that
last
tax
on
soap
princess
said
nurse
turning
very
pale
i
know
said
the
professor
a
boat
on
the
canal
blue
sails
with
gold
letters
pupil
of
the
professor
it
waiting
you
go
down
there
at
once
i
take
the
princess
out
down
the
back
stairs
he
caught
the
princess
by
her
pink
hand
and
dragged
her
away
my
dear
he
panted
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
to
delay
a
minute
but
he
himself
delayed
quite
three
minutes
and
that
was
one
minute
too
long
he
had
just
run
into
the
palace
library
for
the
manuscript
of
his
life
work
easily
explained
when
the
revolutionary
crowd
burst
in
shouting
and
soap
and
caught
him
they
did
not
see
the
princess
everilda
because
he
had
just
time
when
he
heard
them
coming
to
throw
a
red
and
green
crochet
antimacassar
over
her
and
to
hide
her
behind
an
armchair
they
taken
me
away
go
down
the
back
stairs
and
try
to
find
the
boat
he
whispered
just
before
they
came
and
took
him
away
and
then
everilda
was
left
alone
when
everything
was
quiet
she
said
to
herself
you
must
cry
you
must
do
as
you
told
and
she
went
down
the
palace
and
out
through
the
palace
kitchen
into
the
street
she
had
never
set
foot
in
the
streets
before
but
she
had
been
driven
through
them
in
a
coach
with
four
white
horses
and
she
knew
the
way
to
the
canal
the
canal
boat
with
the
blue
sails
was
waiting
and
she
would
have
got
to
it
safely
enough
but
she
heard
a
rattling
sound
and
when
she
looked
she
saw
two
boys
tying
an
old
rusty
kettle
to
a
cat
tail
horrid
boys
she
said
poor
pussy
alone
us
said
the
boys
everilda
instantly
slapped
them
both
and
they
were
so
surprised
that
they
let
the
cat
go
it
scuttled
and
scurried
off
and
so
did
the
princess
the
boys
threw
stones
after
her
and
also
after
the
cat
but
fortunately
they
were
both
very
bad
shots
and
nobody
was
hit
even
then
the
princess
would
have
got
safely
away
but
she
saw
a
boy
sitting
on
a
doorstep
crying
so
she
stopped
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
hungry
said
the
boy
father
and
mother
are
dead
and
my
uncle
beat
me
so
i
running
away
said
the
princess
am
i
what
fun
and
i
got
a
horrid
uncle
too
you
come
with
me
and
we
find
my
nurse
running
away
too
make
haste
or
it
be
too
late
but
when
they
got
to
the
corner
it
too
late
the
revolutionary
crowd
caught
them
they
shouted
and
soap
and
they
sent
the
boy
to
the
workhouse
and
they
put
the
princess
in
prison
and
a
good
many
of
them
wanted
to
cut
off
her
pretty
little
head
then
and
there
because
they
thought
she
would
be
sure
to
grow
up
horrid
like
her
uncle
the
regent
but
all
the
people
who
had
ever
been
inside
the
palace
said
what
a
nice
little
girl
the
princess
really
was
and
would
hear
of
cutting
off
her
darling
head
so
at
last
it
was
decided
to
get
rid
of
her
by
enchantment
and
the
head
magician
to
the
provisional
revolutionary
government
was
sent
for
citizens
he
said
put
her
in
a
tower
on
the
forlorn
island
in
the
middle
of
the
perilous
sea
a
nice
strong
tower
with
only
one
way
out
one
too
many
there
not
to
be
any
way
out
said
the
people
there
a
way
out
of
everything
you
know
said
the
magician
timidly
he
was
trembling
for
his
own
head
it
fifty
thousand
millions
to
one
against
her
ever
finding
it
so
they
had
to
be
content
with
that
and
they
fetched
everilda
out
of
her
prison
and
the
magician
took
her
hand
and
called
his
carriage
which
was
an
invention
of
his
own
half
dragon
and
half
and
half
so
that
it
was
a
carriage
and
a
half
and
came
when
it
was
called
tame
as
any
pet
dog
he
lifted
everilda
in
and
said
up
to
his
patent
carriage
and
the
intelligent
creature
geed
up
right
into
the
air
and
flew
away
the
princess
shut
her
eyes
tight
and
tried
not
to
scream
she
succeeded
when
the
magician
carriage
got
to
the
place
where
it
knew
it
ought
to
stop
it
did
stop
and
tumbled
everilda
out
on
to
a
hard
floor
and
went
back
to
its
master
who
patted
it
and
gave
it
a
good
feed
of
oil
and
fire
and
water
and
petroleum
spirit
the
princess
opened
her
eyes
as
the
sound
of
the
rattling
dragon
wings
died
away
she
was
alone
quite
alone
wo
stay
here
said
everilda
run
away
again
she
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
tower
and
looked
down
the
tower
was
in
the
middle
of
a
garden
and
the
garden
was
in
the
middle
of
a
wood
and
the
wood
was
in
the
middle
of
a
field
and
after
the
field
there
was
nothing
more
at
all
except
steep
cliffs
and
the
great
rolling
raging
waves
of
the
perilous
sea
no
way
to
run
away
by
she
said
and
then
she
remembered
that
even
if
she
ran
away
there
was
now
nowhere
to
run
to
because
the
people
had
taken
her
palace
away
from
her
and
the
palace
was
the
only
home
she
had
ever
had
and
where
her
nurse
was
goodness
only
knew
i
suppose
i
got
to
live
here
till
someone
fetches
me
she
said
and
stopped
crying
like
a
brave
king
daughter
as
she
was
explore
said
everilda
all
alone
will
be
fun
she
said
it
bravely
and
really
it
was
more
fun
than
she
expected
the
tower
had
only
one
room
on
each
floor
the
top
floor
was
everilda
bedroom
she
knew
that
by
her
brushes
and
things
with
on
them
that
lay
on
the
the
next
floor
was
a
and
the
next
a
and
the
last
of
all
was
a
kitchen
with
rows
of
bright
pots
and
pans
and
everything
that
a
cook
can
possibly
want
i
can
play
at
cooking
said
the
princess
always
wanted
to
do
that
if
only
there
was
something
to
cook
she
looked
in
the
cupboards
and
there
were
lots
of
canisters
and
jars
with
rice
and
flour
and
beans
and
peas
and
lentils
and
macaroni
and
currants
and
raisins
and
candied
peel
and
sugar
and
sago
and
cinnamon
she
ate
a
whole
lump
of
candied
citron
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
sha
starve
anyway
she
said
oh
of
course
i
shall
soon
eat
up
all
these
things
and
then
in
her
agitation
she
dropped
the
jar
it
did
not
break
but
all
the
candied
peel
rolled
away
into
corners
and
under
tables
yet
when
she
picked
the
jar
up
it
was
as
full
as
ever
hooray
cried
everilda
who
had
once
heard
a
sentry
use
that
low
expression
course
it
a
magic
tower
and
everything
is
magic
in
it
the
jars
will
always
be
full
the
fire
was
laid
so
she
lighted
it
and
boiled
some
rice
but
it
stuck
to
the
pot
and
got
burned
you
know
how
nasty
burned
rice
is
and
the
macaroni
she
tried
to
cook
would
not
get
soft
so
she
went
out
into
the
garden
and
had
a
very
much
nicer
dinner
than
she
could
ever
have
cooked
instead
of
meat
she
had
apples
and
instead
of
vegetables
she
had
plums
and
she
had
peaches
instead
of
pudding
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
beautiful
books
in
the
and
she
read
a
little
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
nurse
in
case
anyone
ever
came
who
knew
nurse
address
and
would
post
it
for
her
and
then
she
had
a
tea
by
this
time
the
sun
was
sinking
all
red
and
splendid
beyond
the
dark
waters
of
the
perilous
sea
and
everilda
sat
down
on
the
window
seat
to
watch
it
i
shall
not
tell
you
whether
she
cried
at
all
then
perhaps
you
would
have
cried
just
a
little
if
you
had
been
in
her
place
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
said
sniffing
slightly
perhaps
she
had
a
cold
nobody
to
tuck
me
up
in
bed
nobody
at
all
and
just
as
she
said
it
something
fat
and
furry
flew
between
her
and
the
sunset
it
hovered
clumsily
a
moment
and
then
swooped
in
at
the
window
cried
the
princess
very
much
frightened
indeed
you
know
me
said
the
stout
furry
creature
folding
its
wings
the
cat
you
saved
from
the
indignity
of
a
rusty
kettle
in
connection
with
my
honourable
tail
that
cat
had
got
wings
said
everilda
you
much
bigger
than
it
and
it
could
talk
do
you
know
it
could
talk
said
the
cat
you
ask
it
said
the
princess
then
said
the
cat
as
for
wings
i
need
wear
them
if
you
rather
i
did
the
cat
took
off
her
wings
rolled
them
neatly
up
like
your
father
rolls
his
umbrella
tied
them
round
with
a
piece
of
string
and
put
them
in
the
corner
drawer
in
the
bureau
better
said
everilda
as
for
size
said
the
cat
i
stayed
ordinary
i
should
be
any
use
to
you
and
i
come
to
be
cook
companion
housemaid
nurse
professor
and
everything
else
so
do
said
the
princess
get
any
bigger
for
while
she
was
speaking
the
cat
had
been
growing
steadily
and
she
was
now
about
the
size
of
a
large
leopard
not
said
the
cat
obligingly
stop
at
once
suppose
said
the
princess
timidly
you
magic
course
said
the
cat
is
here
do
you
be
afraid
of
me
now
come
along
my
pet
time
for
bed
everilda
umped
for
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
her
nurse
but
it
was
also
the
voice
of
the
cat
cried
the
princess
throwing
her
arms
round
the
cat
large
furry
neck
not
afraid
of
thing
when
you
speak
like
that
so
after
all
she
had
someone
to
tuck
her
up
in
bed
the
cat
did
it
with
large
soft
furry
clever
paws
and
in
two
minutes
everilda
was
fast
asleep
and
now
began
the
long
lonely
but
all
the
same
quite
happy
time
which
the
princess
and
the
cat
spent
together
on
the
forlorn
island
everilda
had
lessons
with
the
cat
and
then
it
was
the
professor
voice
that
the
cat
spoke
with
and
the
two
did
the
neat
little
housework
of
the
tower
together
and
then
the
cat
voice
was
like
the
voices
of
the
palace
housemaids
and
they
did
the
cooking
and
then
the
cat
voice
was
the
cook
voice
and
they
played
games
together
and
then
the
voice
of
the
cat
was
like
the
voices
of
all
sorts
of
merry
children
it
was
impossible
to
be
dull
with
a
companion
who
changed
so
often
who
are
you
the
princess
used
to
ask
and
the
cat
always
answered
give
it
up
ask
another
as
if
the
princess
had
been
playing
at
riddles
is
it
our
garden
is
always
so
tidy
and
full
of
nice
fruit
and
vegetables
the
princess
asked
once
when
they
had
been
on
the
island
about
a
year
said
the
cat
you
know
the
moles
you
used
to
let
out
of
the
traps
do
the
digging
and
the
birds
you
used
to
feed
bring
the
seeds
in
their
little
beaks
and
the
mice
you
used
to
save
from
the
palace
do
the
weeding
and
raking
with
their
sharp
little
teeth
and
their
fine
neat
needly
claws
how
did
they
get
here
asked
the
princess
usual
way
swimming
and
flying
said
the
cat
are
the
mice
afraid
of
me
the
great
cat
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
would
think
to
hear
you
that
i
was
a
cat
and
she
was
really
cross
for
nearly
an
hour
that
was
the
only
approach
to
a
quarrel
that
the
two
ever
had
sometimes
at
first
the
princess
used
to
say
long
am
i
to
stay
here
and
the
cat
always
said
in
nurse
voice
you
grown
up
my
dear
and
the
years
went
by
and
each
year
found
the
princess
more
good
and
clever
and
beautiful
and
at
last
she
was
quite
grown
up
said
the
cat
briskly
must
get
to
work
there
a
prince
in
a
kingdom
a
long
way
off
and
he
the
only
person
who
can
get
you
off
this
island
he
know
asked
everilda
knows
about
but
he
does
know
that
he
the
person
to
find
you
and
he
does
know
where
you
are
so
now
every
night
i
must
fly
away
and
whisper
about
you
in
his
ear
he
think
it
dreams
but
he
believes
in
dreams
and
he
come
in
a
grand
ship
with
masts
of
gold
and
sails
of
silk
and
carry
my
pretty
away
and
make
a
queen
of
her
i
like
that
do
you
think
asked
the
princess
and
the
cat
replied
very
much
indeed
but
you
would
like
it
if
it
were
any
other
king
than
this
one
so
it
just
as
well
that
it
quite
impossible
for
it
to
any
other
will
he
come
asked
the
princess
i
tell
you
in
a
ship
of
course
said
the
cat
the
rocks
dangerous
asked
the
princess
very
the
cat
answered
said
the
princess
and
grew
silent
and
thoughtful
that
night
the
cat
got
out
its
wings
and
unrolled
them
and
brushed
them
and
fitted
them
on
then
she
lighted
a
large
lamp
and
set
it
in
the
window
that
looked
out
on
the
perilous
sea
the
beacon
to
guide
the
king
to
you
she
said
it
guide
other
ships
here
asked
the
princess
perhaps
the
wrong
kings
on
board
the
ones
i
should
like
being
queen
with
likely
said
the
cat
it
does
matter
they
only
be
wrecked
serve
them
right
coming
after
princesses
that
do
want
them
said
everilda
the
cat
spread
her
wings
and
after
one
or
two
trial
flights
round
the
tower
she
spread
them
very
wide
indeed
and
flew
away
across
the
black
perilous
sea
towards
a
little
half
moon
that
was
standing
on
its
head
to
show
sailors
that
there
would
be
foul
weather
the
princess
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
and
looked
out
over
the
sea
down
below
in
the
garden
she
could
hear
the
kind
moles
digging
industriously
and
the
good
little
mice
weeding
and
raking
with
their
sharp
teeth
and
their
fine
needly
claws
and
far
away
against
the
moon
she
saw
the
sails
and
masts
of
a
ship
she
cried
it
sure
not
to
be
ship
it
be
wrecked
and
she
turned
the
lamp
out
and
then
she
cried
a
little
because
perhaps
after
all
it
might
be
ship
and
he
would
pass
by
and
never
know
next
night
the
cat
went
out
on
another
flying
excursion
leaving
the
lamp
lighted
and
again
the
princess
could
not
bear
to
go
to
bed
leaving
a
lamp
burning
that
might
lure
honest
kings
and
brave
mariners
to
shipwreck
so
she
put
out
the
lamp
and
cried
a
little
and
this
happened
for
many
many
many
nights
when
the
cat
swept
the
room
of
a
morning
she
used
to
wonder
where
all
the
pearls
came
from
that
she
found
lying
all
about
the
floor
but
it
was
a
magic
place
and
one
soon
ceased
to
wonder
much
about
anything
she
never
guessed
that
the
pearls
were
the
tears
the
princess
shed
when
she
had
put
out
the
lamp
and
seen
ship
after
ship
that
perhaps
carried
her
own
king
go
sailing
safely
and
ignorantly
by
no
one
on
board
guessing
that
on
that
rock
was
a
pretty
dear
princess
waiting
to
be
rescued
princess
the
only
princess
that
that
king
would
be
happy
and
glad
to
have
for
his
queen
and
the
years
went
on
and
on
every
night
the
cat
lighted
the
lamp
and
flew
away
to
whisper
dreams
into
the
ears
of
the
only
king
who
could
rescue
the
princess
and
every
night
the
princess
put
out
the
lamp
and
cried
in
the
dark
and
every
morning
the
cat
swept
up
a
dustpan
full
of
pearls
that
were
everilda
tears
and
again
and
again
the
king
would
fit
out
a
vessel
and
sail
the
seas
and
look
in
vain
for
the
bright
light
that
he
had
dreamed
should
guide
him
to
his
princess
the
cat
was
a
good
deal
vexed
she
could
not
understand
how
any
king
could
be
so
stupid
she
always
stayed
out
all
night
she
used
to
go
and
see
her
friends
after
she
had
done
whispering
dreams
to
the
king
and
only
got
home
in
time
to
light
the
fire
for
breakfast
so
she
never
knew
how
the
princess
put
out
the
lamp
every
night
and
cried
in
the
dark
the
years
went
by
and
went
by
and
the
princess
grew
old
and
gray
for
she
had
never
had
the
heart
to
leave
the
lamp
alight
for
fear
that
some
poor
mariners
who
were
not
her
king
should
be
drawn
by
the
lamp
to
those
cruel
rocks
and
wrecked
on
them
for
of
course
it
would
and
be
the
poor
mariners
fault
that
they
did
happen
to
be
the
one
and
only
king
who
could
land
safely
on
the
forlorn
island
and
when
the
princess
was
quite
old
and
the
tear
pearls
that
had
been
swept
up
by
the
cat
filled
seven
big
chests
in
the
the
princess
fell
think
i
am
going
to
die
she
said
to
the
cat
i
am
not
really
at
all
sorry
except
for
you
i
think
you
miss
me
tell
me
now
almost
all
over
who
are
you
really
give
it
up
said
the
cat
as
usual
another
but
the
princess
asked
nothing
more
she
lay
on
her
bed
in
her
white
gown
and
waited
for
death
for
she
was
very
tired
of
being
alive
only
she
said
out
that
lamp
in
the
window
it
hurts
my
eyes
for
even
then
she
thought
of
the
poor
men
whose
ships
might
be
wrecked
just
because
they
did
happen
to
be
the
one
and
only
king
with
whom
she
could
be
happy
so
the
cat
took
the
lamp
away
but
she
did
not
put
it
out
she
set
it
in
the
window
of
the
parlour
and
its
light
shone
out
over
the
black
waters
of
the
perilous
sea
and
that
very
night
the
one
and
only
king
who
in
all
these
years
had
never
ceased
to
follow
the
leading
of
the
dreams
the
cat
whispered
in
his
ear
came
in
the
black
darkness
sailing
over
the
perilous
sea
and
in
the
black
darkness
he
saw
at
last
the
bright
white
light
that
his
dreams
had
promised
and
he
knew
that
where
the
light
was
his
princess
was
and
his
heart
leaped
up
and
he
bade
the
helmsmen
steer
for
the
light
and
for
the
light
they
steered
and
because
he
was
the
only
possible
king
to
mate
that
princess
the
helmsman
found
the
only
possible
passage
among
the
rocks
and
the
ship
anchored
safely
in
a
little
quiet
creek
and
the
king
landed
and
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
tower
and
knocked
there
said
the
cat
said
the
king
just
as
you
or
i
might
have
done
late
said
the
cat
afraid
you
lost
your
chance
took
the
first
chance
i
got
said
the
king
me
in
and
let
me
see
her
he
had
been
so
busy
all
these
years
trying
to
find
the
bright
white
light
of
his
dreams
that
he
had
not
noticed
that
his
hair
had
gone
gray
long
ago
so
the
cat
let
him
in
and
led
him
up
the
winding
stair
to
the
room
where
the
princess
very
quiet
lay
on
her
white
bed
waiting
for
death
to
come
for
she
was
very
tired
the
old
king
stumbled
across
the
bar
of
moonlight
on
the
floor
flung
down
a
clanking
wallet
and
knelt
by
the
bed
in
the
deep
shadow
saying
my
dear
own
princess
i
have
come
at
last
it
really
you
she
said
and
gave
him
her
hands
in
the
shadow
i
hoped
it
was
death
i
heard
coming
up
the
winding
stair
did
you
hope
for
death
he
cried
i
was
coming
to
you
were
long
in
coming
said
she
i
was
very
tired
beautiful
dear
princess
he
said
shall
rest
in
my
arms
till
you
are
not
tired
any
more
beautiful
king
she
said
am
not
tired
any
more
now
and
then
the
cat
came
in
with
the
lamp
and
they
looked
in
each
eyes
instead
of
the
beautiful
princess
of
his
dreams
the
king
saw
a
white
withered
woman
whose
piteous
eyes
met
his
in
a
look
of
longing
love
the
princess
saw
a
bent
man
but
love
was
in
his
eyes
do
mind
do
mind
they
both
spoke
together
and
both
thought
they
spoke
the
truth
but
the
truth
was
that
both
were
horribly
disappointed
all
the
same
said
the
king
to
himself
and
withered
as
she
is
she
is
more
to
me
than
the
youngest
and
loveliest
of
all
other
princesses
do
care
if
he
gray
said
the
princess
to
herself
he
is
he
the
only
possible
one
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
said
the
cat
on
earth
did
you
come
before
came
as
soon
as
i
could
said
the
king
the
cat
walking
about
the
room
in
an
agitated
way
kicked
against
the
wallet
the
king
had
dropped
this
she
said
crossly
rubbing
her
toes
for
the
wallet
was
hard
and
she
had
hurt
herself
more
than
a
little
that
said
the
king
just
the
steel
bolts
and
hammers
and
things
that
my
resolves
to
find
the
princess
turned
into
when
i
failed
and
never
did
find
her
i
never
could
bear
to
throw
them
away
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
they
might
be
good
for
something
since
they
hurt
me
so
much
when
they
came
to
me
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
batter
down
the
doors
of
the
princess
tower
with
them
good
for
something
better
than
that
said
the
cat
joyously
she
went
away
and
the
two
heard
her
hammering
away
below
presently
she
staggered
in
with
a
great
basket
of
white
powder
and
emptied
it
on
the
floor
then
she
went
away
for
more
the
king
helped
her
with
the
next
basketful
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
for
there
were
seven
of
them
and
the
heap
of
white
powder
stood
up
in
the
room
as
high
as
the
middle
powder
of
pearls
said
the
cat
proudly
tell
me
have
you
been
a
good
king
have
tried
to
be
said
the
king
was
a
workhouse
boy
and
then
i
was
apprenticed
to
a
magician
who
taught
me
how
to
make
people
happy
there
was
a
revolution
just
at
the
time
when
i
was
put
into
the
workhouse
and
they
had
a
republic
and
i
worked
my
way
up
till
they
made
me
president
became
of
the
king
in
that
revolution
was
a
king
only
a
regent
they
had
him
taught
a
trade
and
he
worked
for
his
living
it
was
the
worst
punishment
they
could
invent
for
him
there
was
a
princess
too
but
she
was
hidden
by
a
magician
i
saw
her
once
when
she
was
trying
to
run
away
she
asked
me
to
run
too
to
her
nurse
here
his
eyes
met
the
princess
she
said
was
you
was
it
said
he
that
was
you
and
they
looked
long
and
lovingly
in
each
other
faded
eyes
up
said
the
cat
impatiently
were
made
president
and
then
why
then
said
the
king
thought
it
would
be
any
more
dangerous
or
expensive
to
have
a
king
than
a
president
and
prettier
at
state
shows
ermine
crown
and
sceptre
and
all
that
prettier
than
and
spats
so
i
agreed
do
your
people
love
you
the
cat
asked
do
know
said
the
king
simply
love
them
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
flutter
and
flicker
of
many
thousand
wings
at
the
closed
casement
the
cat
threw
the
window
wide
and
in
swarmed
a
countless
crowd
of
white
pigeons
are
the
blessings
of
your
people
said
the
cat
the
wings
fluttered
and
flickered
and
fanned
the
heap
of
pearl
dust
on
the
floor
till
it
burst
into
flame
and
the
flame
rose
up
high
and
white
and
clear
cried
the
cat
through
it
lead
her
through
the
old
king
gave
his
hand
to
his
poor
faded
love
and
raised
her
from
her
couch
and
together
they
passed
through
the
clear
fire
made
of
her
patience
and
his
high
resolve
and
the
blessings
of
his
people
and
they
came
out
of
that
fire
on
the
other
side
love
how
beautiful
you
are
cried
the
king
my
king
your
face
is
the
face
of
all
my
dreams
cried
the
princess
and
they
put
their
arms
round
each
other
and
cried
for
joy
because
now
they
were
both
young
and
beautiful
again
the
cat
cried
for
sympathy
now
we
shall
live
happy
ever
after
said
the
princess
putting
her
other
arm
round
the
cat
do
tell
me
now
it
all
over
who
you
really
are
give
it
up
ask
another
said
the
cat
but
as
she
spoke
she
went
herself
through
the
fire
and
on
the
other
side
came
out
not
one
person
but
eleven
she
was
in
fact
the
professor
the
nurse
the
palace
butler
footman
housemaid
parlourmaid
boots
scullion
boy
in
buttons
as
well
as
the
rescued
cat
all
rolled
into
one
we
only
used
one
part
of
ourselves
at
a
time
they
all
said
with
one
voice
i
hope
we
were
useful
were
a
darling
said
the
princess
i
mean
but
who
turned
you
all
into
exactly
the
i
wanted
that
was
the
magician
said
all
the
voices
in
unison
was
your
you
know
has
become
of
him
asked
the
princess
clinging
to
her
arm
been
asleep
all
this
time
it
was
the
condition
the
only
way
he
got
leave
to
work
the
good
magic
for
all
of
us
said
the
many
voices
that
were
one
go
and
wake
him
said
the
king
so
they
all
went
and
when
they
woke
the
magician
who
was
sleeping
quietly
in
his
own
private
room
in
the
palace
where
the
princess
had
once
lived
he
sneezed
seven
times
for
pure
joy
and
then
called
for
welsh
rabbit
and
baked
spanish
onions
for
supper
after
all
these
years
of
starvation
he
said
do
really
think
i
may
for
once
take
a
liberty
with
my
digestion
so
he
had
the
supper
he
wanted
but
the
king
and
the
princess
had
roses
and
lilies
and
because
they
were
married
that
very
evening
and
when
you
have
passed
through
exactly
the
sort
of
fire
those
two
had
passed
through
you
can
never
be
old
or
ugly
or
unhappy
again
so
those
two
are
happy
and
beautiful
and
young
to
this
very
hour
the
white
horse
father
diggory
said
want
to
go
out
and
seek
my
fortune
your
grandmother
said
his
father
but
not
unkindly
he
was
smoking
a
pipe
outside
his
cottage
door
and
he
had
a
handkerchief
over
his
head
because
of
the
flies
there
were
flies
then
just
the
same
as
there
are
now
though
it
was
a
hundred
years
ago
by
the
church
clock
was
thinking
of
my
grandmother
said
diggory
was
thinking
of
my
uncle
diggory
he
was
the
third
son
of
a
woodcutter
just
like
i
am
and
he
saw
right
enough
that
that
the
sort
that
to
go
out
and
seek
its
fortune
and
i
getting
on
father
i
shall
be
twenty
before
you
know
where
you
are
have
to
be
twenty
and
more
before
i
agree
not
to
know
where
are
said
his
father
uncle
diggory
did
well
for
himself
sure
enough
and
many
a
turkey
and
chine
he
sent
us
at
but
he
started
he
did
he
got
the
horse
from
uncle
diggory
and
he
was
a
rover
too
now
if
you
went
you
have
to
go
on
shank
mare
and
them
that
go
comes
back
you
let
me
go
then
if
i
can
get
a
horse
said
diggory
coaxingly
say
yes
dad
and
then
i
wo
say
another
word
about
it
till
i
got
the
horse
the
lad
then
shouted
the
father
diggory
jumped
up
from
the
porch
seat
farewell
home
and
hey
for
the
road
cried
he
i
got
the
horse
dad
my
uncle
diggory
sent
it
to
me
this
very
day
and
it
tied
up
behind
the
lodge
white
it
is
and
a
red
saddle
and
bridle
fit
for
a
king
the
woodcutter
grumbled
but
he
was
a
woodcutter
of
honour
and
having
said
he
had
to
stick
to
yes
so
diggory
rode
off
on
the
white
horse
with
the
scarlet
saddle
and
all
the
village
turned
out
to
see
him
go
he
had
on
his
best
white
smock
and
he
had
never
felt
so
fine
in
all
his
days
so
he
rode
away
when
he
came
to
the
round
mound
windmill
he
stopped
for
there
was
joyce
taking
in
the
clean
clothes
from
the
hedge
because
it
was
monday
evening
he
told
her
where
he
was
going
might
take
me
with
you
she
said
not
so
very
heavy
but
what
we
could
both
ride
on
that
great
big
horse
of
yours
and
she
held
up
a
face
as
sweet
as
a
bunch
of
flowers
but
diggory
said
my
dear
why
you
little
silly
girls
ca
go
to
seek
their
fortunes
you
only
be
in
my
way
wish
me
luck
child
so
he
rode
on
and
she
folded
up
the
linen
all
crooked
and
damped
it
down
with
her
tears
so
that
it
was
quite
ready
for
ironing
diggory
rode
on
and
on
and
on
he
rode
through
dewy
evening
and
through
the
cool
black
night
and
right
into
the
pinky
pearly
dawning
and
when
it
was
real
live
morning
diggory
felt
very
thin
and
empty
inside
his
smock
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
yesterday
and
then
it
was
pork
and
greens
he
rode
on
and
he
rode
on
and
he
came
to
a
red
brick
wall
very
strong
and
stout
with
big
buttresses
and
a
stone
coping
his
horse
whom
he
had
christened
invicta
and
perhaps
if
he
had
known
as
much
latin
as
you
do
he
would
have
called
him
something
different
was
a
very
high
horse
indeed
and
by
standing
up
in
his
stirrups
diggory
could
see
over
the
wall
and
he
saw
that
on
the
other
side
was
an
orchard
full
of
trees
full
of
apples
red
and
yellow
and
green
he
reined
invicta
in
close
under
the
wall
and
said
there
stand
still
will
and
he
stood
up
on
the
broad
saddle
and
made
a
jump
and
caught
at
the
stone
coping
of
the
wall
and
next
moment
he
had
hung
by
his
hands
and
dropped
into
the
orchard
and
it
was
a
very
long
drop
indeed
for
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
take
some
of
the
apples
first
because
he
was
hungry
and
secondly
because
boys
take
apples
in
stories
that
is
of
course
they
would
never
think
of
such
a
thing
with
a
practised
eye
diggory
chose
the
tree
with
the
fattest
rosiest
apples
on
it
he
climbed
the
tree
and
had
just
settled
himself
astride
a
convenient
bough
when
he
heard
a
voice
say
you
up
there
and
looking
down
he
saw
a
old
man
with
a
red
flannel
waistcoat
standing
under
the
tree
looking
up
spitefully
my
fine
fellow
said
the
old
man
seem
a
nice
honest
lad
and
i
sorry
for
your
sake
that
apple
stealing
punished
so
severely
in
these
parts
not
had
any
apples
yet
said
diggory
here
i
go
away
if
you
like
and
we
say
no
more
about
it
a
handsome
offer
very
said
the
nasty
old
man
this
is
an
enchanted
orchard
and
you
ca
go
away
without
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
as
you
came
in
why
you
ca
even
get
out
of
the
tree
and
as
for
climbing
the
wall
no
one
can
do
it
without
a
white
horse
to
help
him
so
now
where
are
you
diggory
knew
very
well
where
he
was
and
he
tried
at
once
to
be
somewhere
else
but
the
old
man
was
right
he
could
move
all
about
the
tree
from
branch
to
branch
but
the
tree
felt
wrong
way
up
and
he
felt
wrong
way
up
that
is
to
say
he
could
not
get
to
the
ground
except
by
jumping
much
harder
than
he
knew
how
to
and
then
he
knew
he
would
only
have
fallen
back
again
just
as
you
would
fall
back
if
you
jumped
up
to
the
ceiling
he
could
have
fallen
off
the
tree
the
other
way
of
course
but
then
he
would
have
fallen
up
into
the
sky
and
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
there
to
stop
his
falling
for
ever
and
ever
so
he
held
tight
and
looked
at
the
old
man
and
diggory
thought
he
looked
nastier
than
ever
so
he
said
and
the
old
man
said
at
all
however
since
you
had
the
sense
not
to
fall
off
wrong
way
i
suppose
you
the
boy
i
want
now
look
here
you
throw
me
down
those
ten
big
apples
one
by
one
so
that
i
can
catch
them
and
i
let
you
go
out
by
the
apple
door
that
no
one
but
me
has
the
key
of
do
you
pick
them
yourself
diggory
asked
too
old
you
know
very
well
that
old
men
do
climb
trees
come
is
it
a
bargain
do
know
said
the
boy
are
lots
of
apples
you
can
reach
without
climbing
why
do
you
want
these
so
particularly
as
he
spoke
he
picked
one
of
the
apples
and
threw
it
up
and
caught
it
i
say
up
but
it
was
down
instead
because
of
the
being
so
very
much
enchanted
the
old
man
squeaked
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
drop
it
throw
it
down
to
me
you
nasty
son
of
a
speckled
toad
diggory
blood
boiled
at
hearing
his
father
called
a
toad
illustration
take
that
cried
he
aiming
an
apple
at
the
old
head
page
that
cried
he
aiming
the
apple
at
the
old
man
head
i
wish
i
could
get
out
of
this
tree
the
apple
hit
the
old
man
head
and
bounced
on
to
the
grass
and
the
moment
that
apple
touched
the
ground
diggory
found
that
he
get
out
of
the
tree
if
he
liked
for
he
felt
that
he
was
now
the
proper
way
up
once
more
and
so
was
the
tree
he
said
are
are
they
no
no
no
shrieked
the
old
man
so
earnestly
that
diggory
knew
he
was
lying
just
disenchanted
you
that
all
you
see
most
people
fall
up
out
of
the
tree
and
you
did
so
i
thought
i
let
you
go
because
i
a
nice
kind
old
man
i
am
and
i
would
so
much
as
hurt
a
fly
they
are
indeed
they
are
said
diggory
wish
you
speak
the
truth
with
that
he
picked
the
second
apple
and
threw
it
and
the
old
man
began
to
speak
the
truth
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
speak
it
was
like
a
child
saying
a
lesson
it
has
just
learned
and
is
afraid
of
forgetting
before
it
can
get
it
said
am
a
wicked
magician
i
have
turned
hundreds
of
people
heads
in
that
tree
so
that
they
fall
into
the
sky
and
when
they
fall
back
again
as
they
have
to
do
when
the
tide
turns
i
make
them
into
i
do
know
why
i
do
but
i
like
to
i
suppose
it
because
i
wicked
i
never
did
anything
useful
with
my
magic
but
i
can
hurt
and
only
one
way
out
of
this
and
i
do
mean
to
show
it
you
a
pity
you
so
wicked
said
diggory
wish
you
were
good
he
threw
down
another
apple
and
instantly
the
magician
became
so
good
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
sit
down
and
cry
to
think
how
wicked
he
had
been
he
was
now
perfectly
useless
but
diggory
was
no
longer
afraid
of
him
so
he
gathered
the
ten
apples
that
were
left
and
put
them
inside
his
shirt
and
came
down
the
tree
the
old
man
could
tell
him
how
to
get
out
and
he
could
disenchant
the
or
anything
so
diggory
had
to
spend
three
first
he
spent
one
on
making
the
old
man
happy
this
was
done
as
it
is
in
miss
edgeworth
stories
by
giving
him
a
thatched
cottage
and
a
garden
and
a
devoted
to
look
after
him
the
next
apple
showed
diggory
the
apple
door
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
and
he
went
out
by
it
you
of
course
can
find
it
on
the
map
but
he
had
no
map
and
besides
it
is
spelt
differently
before
he
went
out
of
the
orchard
he
threw
down
another
apple
and
wished
the
to
be
disenchanted
and
they
were
and
then
the
orchard
was
full
of
kings
and
princesses
and
swineherds
and
goosegirls
and
statesmen
and
stevedores
and
every
kind
of
person
you
can
or
ca
think
of
diggory
left
them
to
find
their
own
ways
home
some
of
them
lived
ever
so
long
before
and
ever
so
far
away
and
he
himself
went
out
by
the
apple
door
and
found
his
good
white
horse
who
had
been
eating
grass
very
happily
all
the
time
he
had
been
in
the
company
of
the
magician
and
that
had
been
two
days
and
a
night
so
invicta
was
not
hungry
but
diggory
was
and
in
fact
he
was
so
hungry
that
he
had
to
use
a
to
get
his
supper
and
that
was
very
very
wasteful
of
him
and
he
often
regretted
it
in
after
years
it
is
true
that
he
wished
for
the
best
supper
in
the
world
and
had
it
but
it
was
only
if
he
had
wished
for
the
nicest
supper
it
would
have
been
different
no
doubt
diggory
rode
on
anxiously
arranging
what
wishes
he
should
have
with
the
rest
of
the
apples
but
in
the
dusk
he
missed
his
way
and
was
nearly
drowned
in
a
ford
and
poor
white
invicta
was
quite
carried
away
then
diggory
took
off
his
shirt
to
wring
the
water
out
and
as
he
took
it
off
he
said
wish
i
had
my
good
white
horse
again
and
as
he
said
it
all
the
apples
but
one
tumbled
out
of
his
shirt
on
to
the
ground
and
he
heard
soft
neighings
and
stampings
and
hustlings
and
rustlings
all
round
him
in
the
dark
and
when
the
moon
rose
he
saw
that
he
had
had
his
wish
he
had
his
good
white
horse
back
again
but
as
he
had
dropped
eight
apples
he
had
his
good
white
horse
back
eight
times
and
as
eight
times
one
is
eight
he
had
now
eight
good
white
horses
all
called
invicta
eight
horses
are
better
than
nothing
he
said
and
when
he
had
tethered
the
horses
he
went
to
sleep
for
he
felt
strangely
feeble
and
tired
in
the
morning
he
woke
with
pains
in
every
limb
he
thought
it
was
a
cold
from
the
wetting
in
the
ford
but
it
was
really
rheumatism
and
he
could
not
get
rid
of
it
he
tied
seven
horses
together
and
led
them
riding
on
the
eighth
horses
are
a
pretty
good
fortune
for
a
woodcutter
son
he
said
to
himself
anyway
i
too
tired
to
go
looking
for
any
better
one
so
he
rode
home
he
knew
the
roads
well
enough
and
yet
they
seemed
different
they
were
much
better
roads
to
ride
over
for
one
thing
and
the
hedges
and
trees
were
odd
somehow
and
the
big
wood
near
his
father
house
seemed
very
small
as
he
looked
down
on
it
from
the
hill
but
when
he
got
to
the
village
he
thought
he
must
have
gone
mad
for
in
the
day
and
two
nights
and
a
day
that
he
had
been
away
the
village
had
grown
big
and
ugly
and
and
there
were
eight
shops
and
six
besides
the
bill
and
billet
and
many
more
people
than
there
used
to
be
all
in
ugly
untidy
clothes
and
the
round
mound
windmill
was
the
people
came
crowding
round
him
become
of
the
mill
he
asked
trembling
all
over
the
boys
and
girls
and
men
and
women
stared
and
a
very
old
man
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
were
pulled
down
he
said
i
were
a
boy
the
woodcutter
cottage
were
burnt
down
a
matter
of
fifty
year
ago
was
you
a
native
of
these
parts
old
man
there
was
a
large
just
opposite
the
crowd
that
surrounded
diggory
a
dark
blind
was
pulled
down
inside
because
it
was
wednesday
and
day
this
made
a
fine
mirror
and
diggory
happened
to
look
in
it
and
there
he
saw
himself
an
old
old
man
on
a
white
horse
he
had
a
white
beard
too
but
it
was
quite
short
because
it
had
only
had
since
bedtime
last
night
to
grow
in
he
almost
tumbled
off
his
horse
the
landlord
of
the
ship
led
him
in
to
sit
by
the
fire
in
the
bar
parlour
and
the
eight
horses
were
put
up
in
the
stable
the
old
man
who
had
told
him
about
the
mill
came
and
sat
by
him
and
poor
old
diggory
asked
questions
till
he
grew
tired
of
hearing
the
answer
which
was
always
the
same
dead
dead
then
he
sat
silent
and
the
people
in
the
bar
talked
about
his
horses
and
a
young
man
said
wish
i
got
a
one
on
i
do
a
tidy
bit
in
fish
an
set
up
for
myself
so
i
would
man
said
diggory
may
take
one
of
them
its
name
is
invicta
the
young
man
could
hardly
believe
his
fortunate
ears
diggory
felt
his
heart
warm
to
think
that
he
had
made
someone
else
so
happy
he
felt
actually
younger
and
next
morning
he
made
up
his
mind
to
give
away
all
the
horses
but
one
that
one
he
would
sell
and
its
price
would
keep
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
hoped
that
would
not
be
long
for
he
did
not
care
to
go
on
living
now
that
he
had
seen
the
tombstones
in
the
churchyard
with
the
names
of
his
father
and
brothers
and
little
joyce
of
the
mill
he
led
his
horses
away
next
day
he
did
not
want
to
give
them
all
away
in
one
village
because
that
would
have
lessened
the
value
of
his
gift
to
the
young
man
who
was
going
into
fish
and
besides
it
would
have
been
awkward
to
have
so
many
horses
of
the
same
name
in
one
village
he
gave
away
a
horse
at
each
village
he
passed
through
and
with
every
horse
he
gave
away
he
felt
happier
and
lighter
and
when
he
had
given
away
the
fourth
his
rheumatism
went
and
when
he
had
given
away
the
seventh
his
beard
was
gone
he
said
to
himself
will
ride
home
and
end
my
days
in
my
own
village
and
be
buried
with
my
own
people
so
he
turned
his
horse
head
towards
home
and
he
felt
so
gay
and
he
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
really
an
old
old
man
and
he
rode
on
and
at
the
end
of
the
village
he
stopped
and
rubbed
his
eyes
for
there
stood
the
round
mound
windmill
and
on
the
slope
was
joyce
looking
prettier
than
ever
in
a
russet
petticoat
and
a
white
neckerchief
and
a
pink
print
gown
with
little
red
rosebuds
on
it
diggory
diggory
she
cried
come
back
then
you
take
me
with
you
now
wo
you
you
got
a
my
dear
said
he
run
in
and
fetch
it
she
ran
he
took
it
and
looked
in
it
and
he
saw
the
same
young
brown
face
and
the
same
bright
brown
hair
that
he
had
always
known
for
and
he
was
not
old
any
more
and
there
was
joyce
holding
up
a
face
as
sweet
as
a
bunch
of
flowers
you
take
me
said
she
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
the
face
that
was
so
sweet
take
you
said
he
and
as
they
went
along
to
his
home
he
told
her
all
the
story
but
she
said
got
one
left
so
i
have
said
he
i
had
forgotten
it
make
that
into
the
fortune
you
went
out
to
find
do
do
let
me
look
at
it
he
pulled
out
the
apple
and
she
took
it
in
her
hand
as
she
sat
behind
him
on
the
big
white
horse
our
fortune
made
he
said
i
do
wish
i
knew
why
i
turned
old
like
that
just
then
invicta
stumbled
and
joyce
caught
at
her
lover
to
save
herself
from
falling
and
as
she
caught
at
him
the
apple
slipped
from
her
hand
and
the
last
wish
was
granted
for
as
it
bounced
on
the
road
diggory
did
know
why
he
had
grown
old
like
that
he
knew
that
the
magician
had
arranged
long
before
that
every
that
was
used
outside
the
orchard
should
add
ten
years
to
the
wisher
age
so
that
the
eight
horses
had
made
him
a
hundred
years
old
and
the
spell
could
only
be
undone
by
the
wisher
giving
away
what
he
wished
for
so
that
it
was
diggory
generosity
in
giving
away
the
horses
that
had
taken
him
back
to
the
proper
age
for
being
happy
in
i
do
want
to
be
moral
and
i
very
sorry
but
it
really
was
that
he
carried
joyce
home
to
his
father
house
they
were
much
too
pleased
with
each
other
to
bother
about
the
wasted
soon
back
my
son
said
the
woodcutter
laughing
said
diggory
you
found
your
fortune
said
diggory
she
is
and
he
presented
joyce
the
woodcutter
laughed
more
than
ever
for
the
miller
daughter
was
a
bit
of
an
heiress
well
he
said
so
they
were
married
and
they
had
a
little
farm
and
the
white
horse
was
put
to
the
plough
and
to
the
cart
and
the
harrow
and
the
waggon
and
he
worked
hard
and
they
worked
hard
so
that
they
all
throve
and
were
very
happy
as
long
as
ever
they
lived
said
joyce
one
day
to
diggory
was
it
you
wanted
to
take
me
with
you
directly
you
came
back
and
when
you
were
going
away
you
did
often
wondered
about
that
myself
he
said
think
it
must
have
been
the
you
see
it
was
one
of
the
things
just
like
the
horses
were
only
they
were
outside
things
so
they
made
me
old
outside
but
the
milk
an
inside
thing
of
course
quite
inside
so
it
made
me
old
inside
of
my
mind
just
old
enough
to
have
the
sense
to
see
that
were
all
the
fortune
i
wanted
and
more
than
i
deserved
did
have
to
be
so
very
old
to
know
what
fortune
wanted
said
joyce
then
i
was
a
girl
boys
are
always
much
stupider
than
girls
are
they
the
only
person
in
this
story
you
are
likely
to
have
heard
of
is
of
course
invicta
and
he
is
better
known
as
the
white
horse
of
kent
you
can
see
pictures
of
him
all
over
his
county
on
brewers
circulars
and
all
sorts
of
documents
and
carved
in
stone
on
buildings
and
even
on
the
disagreeable
insulting
fronts
of
pretend
to
despise
horses
but
they
carry
the
image
of
the
white
horse
on
their
hearts
and
his
name
is
generally
put
underneath
his
picture
so
that
there
shall
be
no
mistake
sir
christopher
cockleshell
the
children
called
him
sir
christopher
in
token
of
respect
for
his
gray
hairs
and
face
christopher
because
he
had
once
carried
mabel
across
the
road
on
a
very
muddy
day
when
thunder
showers
and
the
parish
had
both
been
particularly
busy
and
cockleshell
because
of
the
house
he
lived
in
it
was
a
most
wonderful
house
like
the
gateway
of
an
old
castle
it
had
a
big
arch
in
the
middle
and
a
window
over
the
arch
and
there
were
windows
too
in
the
towers
on
each
side
of
the
arch
all
along
the
top
were
battlements
it
had
been
covered
with
white
plaster
once
but
flakes
of
this
had
fallen
away
and
showed
the
pinky
bricks
underneath
but
the
oddest
thing
about
the
house
was
the
trimming
that
ran
all
round
the
bottom
story
about
the
height
of
a
tall
man
this
trimming
was
of
and
and
and
and
all
stuck
on
the
wall
of
the
house
in
patterns
it
was
a
very
wonderful
house
indeed
and
the
children
always
tried
to
go
past
it
on
their
way
to
everywhere
the
children
themselves
lived
in
a
large
square
ordinary
house
among
other
ordinary
houses
their
house
had
a
long
garden
with
tall
old
trees
in
it
and
so
had
the
other
houses
looking
out
of
the
boxroom
window
was
like
looking
down
on
the
top
of
a
green
forest
phyllis
always
thought
only
now
of
course
the
trees
were
not
green
any
more
because
it
was
nearly
christmas
wish
sir
christopher
had
a
garden
to
his
house
phyllis
said
one
day
to
the
new
housemaid
used
to
be
a
there
i
heard
father
tell
said
the
new
housemaid
a
big
gardens
it
was
the
gent
as
owned
it
was
as
rich
as
rich
kep
his
carriage
and
butlers
and
all
but
when
his
son
come
into
the
property
he
sold
the
gardens
for
building
on
and
only
kep
the
the
grotto
they
calls
it
an
there
lived
ever
since
in
quite
a
poor
way
nasty
old
miser
that
what
he
is
may
be
a
miser
said
phyllis
he
not
nasty
he
carried
mabel
as
kind
as
could
be
you
ever
spoke
to
him
since
demanded
the
housemaid
said
phyllis
always
smiles
at
us
but
he
always
in
a
hurry
it
said
the
housemaid
afraid
to
let
anyone
inside
of
his
house
fear
they
should
get
to
see
all
the
sacks
of
money
he
got
there
and
he
pokes
about
and
picks
things
outer
the
gutters
so
he
wo
get
to
know
anyone
my
young
brother
he
knocked
at
the
door
once
to
arst
for
a
drink
of
water
thought
he
get
a
squint
at
the
inside
of
the
house
while
the
old
chap
was
gone
to
draw
it
but
he
shuts
the
door
in
elf
face
and
only
opens
it
a
crack
to
hand
him
the
mug
through
was
kind
of
him
to
give
your
brother
the
water
said
phyllis
didun
want
the
water
said
alf
sister
just
a
lemonade
at
the
paper
shop
phyllis
had
often
wanted
to
do
something
kind
for
sir
christopher
but
she
could
not
think
of
anything
that
was
just
as
likely
to
annoy
him
as
to
please
him
if
she
had
known
when
his
birthday
was
she
would
have
put
a
birthday
card
under
his
door
but
no
one
can
be
pleased
at
having
a
card
with
be
thy
natal
morn
on
it
when
really
the
natal
morn
is
quite
a
different
date
she
would
have
taken
him
flowers
at
the
time
when
dahlias
and
sunflowers
grew
at
the
end
of
the
garden
but
perhaps
he
would
not
like
the
bother
of
putting
them
in
water
and
if
he
was
really
poor
and
not
a
miser
as
jane
said
he
might
not
have
a
vase
or
jug
to
put
them
in
and
now
it
was
guy
was
home
for
the
holidays
and
that
was
splendid
but
on
the
other
hand
mother
and
father
had
had
to
go
to
granny
who
was
ill
so
there
would
be
no
real
christmas
in
the
brown
house
i
tell
you
what
said
phyllis
the
for
the
poor
children
at
the
schools
suppose
we
were
to
make
some
things
for
that
and
buy
some
and
go
down
and
help
decorate
mother
said
we
might
guy
was
rather
clever
with
his
fingers
and
as
we
all
like
doing
what
we
can
do
really
well
he
did
not
make
such
a
fuss
over
making
things
as
some
boys
do
he
could
make
doll
furniture
out
of
pins
and
wool
and
armchairs
out
of
the
of
geese
only
there
are
so
seldom
enough
of
geese
to
make
a
complete
set
of
furniture
there
was
nearly
a
week
to
make
things
in
and
long
before
its
end
the
schoolroom
began
to
look
like
a
bazaar
there
were
little
boxes
of
sweets
covered
with
silver
paper
and
scrapbooks
made
of
postcards
covered
with
red
calico
and
some
little
dolls
that
the
girls
dressed
as
well
as
all
the
things
that
guy
made
ravishingly
beautiful
said
mabel
when
the
shiny
shimmery
real
things
bought
at
the
shop
were
spread
out
with
the
others
the
day
before
christmas
eve
the
children
were
very
happy
indeed
although
they
had
had
to
be
made
thoroughly
tidy
before
jane
would
allow
them
to
go
down
to
the
school
and
being
thoroughly
tidy
as
you
know
often
means
a
lot
of
soap
in
your
eyes
and
having
your
nails
cleaned
by
someone
who
does
not
know
as
well
as
you
do
where
the
nail
leaves
off
and
the
real
you
begins
they
went
to
the
of
the
school
and
left
the
baskets
and
bundles
of
pretty
things
in
the
porch
and
went
in
the
big
tree
was
there
but
it
was
just
plain
so
far
nothing
christmassy
about
it
except
that
it
was
planted
in
a
tub
do
you
do
said
guy
politely
to
the
stout
lady
in
a
bonnet
with
black
beads
and
a
violet
feather
so
glad
we
in
time
for
said
the
stout
lady

not
till

phyllis
not

little
boy

you
remember
him

petticoats
said
philkins
grown
said
said
guy
keeping
his
temper
beautifully
we
might
come
and
help
kind
of
your
mother
to
arrange
it
like
that
but
happen
to
be
in
charge
of
the
tree
and
i
do
want
any
outside
assistance
the
children
turned
away
without
a
word
when
they
got
outside
guy
said
hate
mrs
philkins
ought
to
hate
anybody
said
mabel
is
anybody
at
least
not
anybody
in
particular
said
phyllis
heard
father
say
so
would
have
been
such
a
pig
to
us
if
she
known
what
brought
for
the
tree
said
phyllis
glad
she
did
know
i
wish
we
had
done
the
things
at
all
said
guy
always
the
way
if
you
try
to
do
good
to
others
said
the
others
indignantly
know
it
is
right
said
guy
aggravatingly
begin
to
quarrel
about
it
that
would
just
please
her
let
drop
the
whole
lot
into
the
canal
and
say
no
more
about
it
cried
both
the
girls
together
clutching
the
precious
parcels
they
carried
what
the
good
said
guy
do
know
anyone
who
got
a
to
give
them
to
phyllis
stopped
short
on
the
pavement
struck
motionless
by
an
idea
know
she
said
have
a
tree
of
our
very
own
the
good
if
there
no
one
to
see
it
ask
someone
to
see
it
christopher
the
daring
and
romance
of
this
idea
charmed
even
guy
but
he
thought
it
would
be
better
not
to
ask
sir
christopher
to
come
to
their
house
are
so
odd
he
said
might
be
rude
to
him
or
something
no
we
get
it
ready
and
we
wheel
it
round
after
dark
and
ask
him
to
let
us
light
it
in
his
yard
then
he
wo
think
trying
to
pry
into
his
house
half
an
hour
later
guy
staggered
in
bearing
a
ninepence
he
said
a
bit
but
we
can
tie
ivy
on
or
something
to
make
that
right
i
glad
that
old
cat
would
let
us
help
it
much
jollier
like
this
the
tree
was
planted
in
a
pot
that
a
dead
azalea
had
lived
in
and
philkins
was
quite
forgotten
in
the
joy
of
trimming
their
own
tree
besides
the
things
they
had
made
there
were
the
lovely
things
they
had
bought
stars
and
flags
and
a
sugar
with
a
yellow
bird
in
it
and
a
glass
boat
with
glass
sails
and
a
blue
china
bird
with
a
tail
of
spun
glass
guy
went
out
and
borrowed
a
wheelbarrow
from
the
gardener
who
cut
their
grass
when
it
was
cut
and
when
the
tree
was
trimmed
he
and
phyllis
carried
it
downstairs
the
top
branch
with
the
star
on
it
got
banged
against
the
banisters
and
the
side
branch
got
into
guy
eye
and
phyllis
thumb
got
jammed
between
the
pot
and
the
banister
rail
but
what
are
trifles
like
these
in
an
adventure
like
this
they
got
the
tree
out
of
the
without
being
seen
by
the
servants
a
real
triumph
they
stood
the
pot
in
the
barrow
and
started
to
wheel
it
out
of
the
but
directly
they
lifted
the
handles
of
the
barrow
the
floor
of
it
naturally
ceased
to
be
straight
and
the
toppled
over
and
cracked
itself
slightly
against
the
side
of
the
barrow
while
the
boughs
of
the
tree
with
their
gay
decorations
took
the
opportunity
to
entangle
themselves
in
the
leaves
of
the
holly
that
stood
there
and
were
disengaged
with
difficulty
then
the
pot
refused
to
stand
up
and
at
last
it
had
to
be
laid
down
in
the
barrow
with
its
shiny
treasures
dangling
over
the
then
the
barrow
was
extremely
heavy
even
without
the
tree
in
it
and
the
children
did
not
go
the
nearest
way
to
the
grotto
because
they
did
not
want
to
meet
people
so
they
were
thoroughly
tired
and
extremely
hot
by
the
time
they
approached
sir
christopher
cockleshell
castle
there
was
a
bit
of
waste
land
close
to
it
where
someone
had
once
begun
to
build
a
house
and
had
then
thought
better
of
it
a
bit
of
this
house
wall
was
standing
on
each
side
of
the
space
where
its
would
have
been
if
it
had
ever
come
to
the
point
of
having
one
they
wheeled
the
barrow
in
and
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
that
obligingly
shone
through
the
made
it
possible
for
them
to
disentangle
the
little
strings
that
had
got
twisted
round
each
other
to
disengage
the
gilt
fish
from
the
sugar
and
to
take
the
glass
bird
out
of
the
armchair
in
which
it
was
trying
to
sit
also
they
set
up
all
the
candles
six
dozen
of
them
this
is
done
with
as
no
doubt
you
know
said
guy
of
us
must
go
and
ask
if
he
let
us
light
it
in
his
yard
and
one
of
us
must
wait
here
with
the
tree
about
me
said
mabel
can
do
which
you
like
said
guy
want
to
do
both
said
mabel
want
to
stay
with
the
pretty
tree
i
want
to
go
and
ask
him
if
he
wants
us
mabel
was
still
too
small
to
understand
thoroughly
how
hard
it
is
even
for
a
person
to
be
in
two
places
at
once
it
ended
in
guy
staying
with
the
tree
case
of
attacks
by
boys
he
said
i
shall
go
with
phyllis
said
mabel
both
girls
felt
their
hearts
go
quite
when
at
last
they
stood
on
the
doorstep
of
the
castle
do
you
knock
mabel
asked
do
like
to
said
phyllis
mabel
instantly
knocked
very
loudly
with
a
wooden
that
she
happened
to
have
in
her
pocket
i
you
had
said
phyllis
wanted
to
think
what
to
say
first
and
now
there
no
time
there
certainly
was
not
the
door
opened
a
cautious
inch
and
a
voice
said
there
us
said
phyllis
we
do
want
to
pry
into
your
beautiful
house
like
jane
brother
alf
when
he
asked
you
for
the
drink
of
water
only
we
made
up
a
and
may
we
stand
it
in
your
yard
and
light
it
the
candles
i
mean
the
door
opened
a
little
further
and
a
face
looked
out
the
face
of
course
of
sir
christopher
all
the
house
that
showed
through
the
crack
of
the
door
did
as
mabel
said
afterwards
show
at
all
because
it
was
do
quite
understand
said
sir
christopher
gently
phyllis
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
the
voice
was
what
she
called
a
gentleman
voice
you
were
so
kind
carrying
mab
across
the
road
that
day
when
it
thundered
it
you
is
it
he
said
it
us
and
they
would
let
us
help
with
the
school
tree
and
so
we
made
one
of
our
own
and
then
we
wanted
someone
to
see
it
and
we
thought
of
you
because
you
do
seem
to
have
many
friends
and
we
thought
but
we
take
it
home
again
if
you
do
care
about
it
she
stopped
just
on
the
right
side
of
tears
a
glass
bird
with
a
tail
said
mabel
persuasively
sweets
and
fishes
and
a
crocodile
that
goes
when
you
wind
him
up
dears
said
sir
christopher
and
cleared
his
throat
dears
he
began
again
and
again
he
stopped
go
away
if
if
you
rather
said
phyllis
and
sniffed
miserably
no
he
said
no
i
was
only
thinking
i
never
thought
would
you
like
to
bring
the
tree
into
the
house
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
my
little
girl
always
liked
yes
said
phyllis
go
and
fetch
it
now
he
closed
the
door
gently
the
children
flew
back
to
guy
and
the
tree
guy
we
to
take
the
tree
inside
the
house
and
he
got
a
little
girl
at
least
he
says
so
come
on
quick
we
better
carry
it
the
barrow
so
heavy
and
it
does
interfere
so
they
carried
the
pot
between
them
it
was
very
heavy
and
they
had
to
put
it
down
and
rest
several
times
but
at
last
they
dumped
it
down
in
the
dark
on
the
step
of
the
castle
and
breathed
deep
breaths
of
fatigue
relief
and
excitement
the
door
opened
and
opened
wide
and
this
time
light
streamed
from
within
said
sir
christopher
in
let
me
help
to
lift
it
what
a
beautiful
tree
is
rather
decent
is
it
said
guy
dispassionately
sir
christopher
raised
the
pot
carried
it
in
and
the
door
was
shut
the
children
found
themselves
in
a
small
square
hall
a
winding
staircase
of
iron
corkscrewed
upwards
in
one
corner
the
hall
was
lighted
only
by
two
candles
the
old
gentleman
led
the
way
through
a
door
on
the
right
into
a
round
room
with
white
walls
inside
the
tower
now
said
guy
said
their
host
is
part
of
the
tower
he
hastily
lighted
a
big
lamp
and
then
a
deep
broke
from
the
children
for
the
walls
were
not
white
they
were
all
of
and
here
and
there
all
over
the
walls
round
pearls
shone
with
a
starry
milky
radiance
radishing
said
mabel
in
a
whisper
always
said
he
was
a
miser
he
a
magician
a
lovely
lovely
room
sighed
phyllis
it
made
of
asked
guy
downrightly
said
sir
christopher
pearl
beads
and
it
was
said
mabel
gaily
that
what
you
go
prowling
about
in
dirty
gutters
for
be
rude
mab
dear
whispered
phyllis
but
the
old
gentleman
did
not
seem
to
mind
he
just
said
it
in
an
absent
sort
of
way
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
about
something
else
then
he
said
the
children
had
forgotten
all
about
the
when
its
candles
were
lighted
the
pearly
room
shone
and
glimmered
like
a
fairy
palace
in
a
dream
many
a
year
since
my
little
girl
had
such
a
he
said
do
know
how
to
thank
you
your
pearly
halls
is
worth
all
the
time
and
money
said
mabel
heartily
and
phyllis
added
in
polite
haste
you
being
pleased
you
like
to
see
the
black
marble
hall
asked
sir
christopher
and
of
course
they
said
awfully
so
he
led
them
into
the
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
and
lighted
a
lamp
and
the
room
was
like
a
room
of
black
marble
carved
into
little
round
knobs
lovely
said
phyllis
not
lovely
like
the
other
said
mabel
it
more
serious
like
when
the
organ
plays
in
church
said
guy
suddenly
and
it
was
hundreds
and
thousands
of
sorted
into
sizes
and
stuck
on
the
walls
in
patterns
and
then
it
seemed
polished
or
varnished
said
sir
christopher
show
you
the
as
they
turned
to
go
a
tall
white
figure
by
the
door
seemed
to
come
suddenly
into
the
lamplight
it
was
covered
with
a
sheet
said
all
three
starting
back
that
my
little
girl
he
said
she
trying
to
frighten
us
is
she
playing
ghosts
asked
guy
he
said
never
plays
at
ghosts
it
is
her
really
only
my
fun
it
a
statue
really
statues
very
dear
asked
guy
said
sir
christopher
very
dear
he
led
the
way
up
the
winding
iron
stair
and
showed
them
the
its
walls
were
covered
with
bits
of
red
overlapping
like
a
fish
scales
or
the
plates
of
armour
resplendid
said
mabel
believe
you
a
mighty
magician
he
said
least
no
not
exactly
there
only
one
more
room
the
other
room
was
a
bedroom
quite
dull
and
plain
with
whitewashed
walls
and
painted
deal
furniture
like
the
pearly
halls
best
said
mabel
more
eloquent
and
they
all
went
down
to
the
room
where
the
candles
of
the
were
burning
steadily
and
brightly
though
there
was
no
one
to
see
them
you
call
your
little
girl
said
phyllis
candles
wo
last
so
very
long
they
the
cheap
kind
sir
christopher
twisted
his
fingers
together
no
use
calling
her
said
you
mind
do
you
mind
leaving
the
tree
for
you
could
fetch
it
and
you
wo
tell
anyone
about
the
inside
of
my
house
will
you
they
only
laugh
at
it
do
see
how
they
could
said
mabel
indignantly
the
beautifullest
gorgerest
house
that
ever
was
we
wo
tell
anyone
said
guy
we
come
again
about
the
same
time
sir
christopher
said
please
and
they
all
shook
hands
with
him
and
came
away
leaving
the
with
all
its
candles
still
making
the
pearly
room
a
dream
of
fairy
beauty
they
ran
all
the
way
home
because
it
was
rather
late
and
they
did
not
want
the
servants
to
fetch
them
from
the
parish
schoolroom
where
they
had
not
spent
the
evening
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
explain
exactly
where
and
how
they
spent
it
and
the
fact
that
they
had
promised
not
to
say
anything
about
it
would
have
added
considerably
to
the
difficulty
when
they
had
been
let
in
and
had
taken
off
their
hats
and
jackets
and
got
their
breaths
they
looked
at
each
other
said
phyllis
said
mabel
an
inciting
adventure
what
a
dear
he
is
i
do
hope
we
shall
see
his
little
girl
said
guy
slowly
i
do
think
we
shall
ever
not
i
do
believe
he
got
any
little
girl
we
went
into
all
the
rooms
and
the
hall
and
landing
there
was
any
other
room
for
the
little
girl
to
be
in
it
was
really
her
under
the
sheet
trying
to
be
ghosts
said
phyllis
was
too
high
up
said
mabel
might
have
been
standing
on
a
stool
said
phyllis
said
guy
with
a
satisfied
look
a
very
thrilling
mystery
it
was
and
it
gave
them
something
to
think
of
for
the
next
few
days
for
that
evening
when
they
went
to
fetch
the
they
found
the
door
of
sir
christopher
castle
tight
shut
and
their
was
standing
alone
on
the
doorstep
in
the
dark
after
vainly
knocking
several
times
they
put
the
tree
into
the
wheelbarrow
and
got
it
home
only
upsetting
it
three
times
by
the
way
when
they
got
it
into
the
light
of
their
schoolroom
they
saw
that
there
was
a
piece
of
paper
on
it
a
note
dears
it
said
is
your
beautiful
tree
thank
you
very
much
if
you
knew
how
much
pleasure
it
had
given
me
you
would
be
glad
why
not
give
the
tree
to
some
poor
child
god
bless
you
there
were
some
letters
tangled
together
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
initials
i
suppose
said
guy
but
nobody
could
read
them
it
means
he
does
want
to
see
us
any
more
said
phyllis
i
do
wish
we
knew
something
more
about
him
but
they
took
his
advice
and
the
tree
went
to
the
gardener
little
boy
who
was
ill
it
made
him
almost
forget
his
illness
for
days
and
days
when
father
came
home
they
asked
him
who
lived
in
the
grotto
he
told
them
has
lived
there
for
years
he
said
have
heard
that
when
he
came
into
his
property
he
found
that
his
property
was
almost
all
debts
so
he
sold
the
for
building
on
and
has
lived
there
in
the
grotto
on
next
to
nothing
and
all
these
years
he
been
paying
off
his
father
creditors
i
should
think
they
about
paid
off
by
now
he
a
little
girl
asked
phyllis
i
believe
so
said
father
absently
very
odd
mabel
was
beginning
but
the
others
silenced
her
after
this
the
children
were
more
interested
than
ever
in
sir
christopher
they
used
to
paint
illuminated
texts
and
make
of
paper
rosettes
and
buy
toys
and
leave
them
on
his
doorstep
in
the
dark
the
little
girl
and
as
the
spring
came
on
bunches
of
flowers
it
was
one
evening
when
phyllis
came
to
the
castle
with
a
big
bunch
of
plumy
purple
lilac
she
was
earlier
than
usual
and
it
was
not
quite
dark
and
wonder
of
wonders
the
door
of
the
castle
was
open
still
more
wonderful
sir
christopher
stood
on
the
doorstep
was
watching
for
you
he
said
had
a
sort
of
feeling
you
come
will
you
come
in
he
led
her
into
the
black
marble
room
and
stood
looking
wistfully
at
her
you
like
to
see
my
little
girl
he
said
suddenly
said
phyllis
did
think
you
understand
he
said
you
came
at
christmas
but
you
been
so
kind
and
faithful
all
these
months
i
think
you
will
understand
look
he
pulled
the
sheet
from
the
statue
and
phyllis
looked
on
the
white
likeness
of
a
little
girl
of
her
own
age
dressed
in
a
long
gown
like
a
nightgown
is
very
beautiful
she
said
he
said
you
ever
heard
any
tales
about
me
he
asked
said
phyllis
and
told
him
not
true
he
said
my
father
had
no
debts
but
i
married
someone
he
did
like
and
then
i
got
ill
and
could
work
my
father
was
very
hard
he
would
help
us
my
wife
died
and
then
my
father
died
and
all
his
great
wealth
came
to
me
too
late
too
late
the
letter
that
told
me
i
was
rich
came
to
me
when
i
was
sitting
beside
my
dead
child
the
money
came
the
money
that
would
have
saved
her
the
first
money
i
spent
out
of
it
all
was
spent
on
that
statue
it
was
done
as
she
lay
dead
phyllis
looked
at
the
statue
and
felt
she
did
know
why
very
frightened
then
she
looked
at
him
and
she
was
not
frightened
any
more
she
ran
to
him
and
put
her
arms
round
him
poor
poor
dear
sir
christopher
she
said
how
she
looked
when
she
was
dead
he
said
you
like
to
see
my
ladybird
as
she
was
when
she
was
alive
and
well
and
i
was
a
strong
man
able
to
work
for
her
oh
yes
said
phyllis
he
led
the
way
into
the
pearly
room
and
drew
back
a
green
curtain
that
hung
there
phyllis
caught
her
breath
sharply
and
tears
pricked
her
eyes
not
because
the
picture
was
a
sad
one
ah
no
not
that
as
the
curtain
was
withdrawn
the
figure
of
a
child
seemed
to
spring
towards
them
from
the
canvas
a
happy
laughing
child
her
arms
full
of
roses
her
face
full
of
health
and
beauty
and
the
joy
of
life
a
child
whose
glad
unclouded
eyes
met
phyllis
in
a
free
joyous
look
no
cried
phyllis
ca
be
dead
she
the
old
man
took
her
in
his
arms
for
she
was
crying
bitterly
you
thank
you
dear
he
said
soothing
her
i
know
that
you
are
the
right
person
to
help
me
help
phyllis
tears
began
to
dry
at
the
beautiful
thought
but
she
still
sobbed
cry
he
said
and
gently
drew
the
green
curtain
over
the
lovely
laughing
face
cry
i
want
to
tell
you
of
many
things
when
that
money
came
i
told
you
when
as
soon
as
i
could
see
or
think
again
i
saw
what
i
ought
to
do
ever
since
i
not
spent
a
penny
of
that
money
on
myself
on
anything
but
the
plainest
food
the
plainest
clothes
if
i
made
the
house
beautiful
for
her
picture
to
live
in
it
been
with
my
own
work
all
the
rest
of
the
money
has
gone
to
help
little
girls
whose
fathers
ca
work
for
them
little
girls
that
can
be
saved
as
my
little
girl
could
have
been
saved
that
the
work
i
want
you
to
carry
on
for
me
when
you
grow
up
will
you
promise
said
phyllis
i
very
stupid
will
have
you
taught
you
shall
learn
how
to
do
my
work
ask
your
father
to
come
and
see
me
and
now
perhaps
i
sha
see
you
again
will
you
always
remember
that
your
came
to
me
like
a
light
in
a
dark
night
to
show
me
that
there
was
someone
still
who
cared
to
be
kind
father
when
he
heard
the
story
almost
thought
that
phyllis
was
dreaming
but
he
went
to
the
grotto
and
when
he
came
back
his
face
was
very
sad
is
a
very
great
honour
for
you
phyllis
he
said
gravely
you
sure
that
you
understand
how
much
hard
work
it
will
mean
do
mind
hard
work
said
phyllis
only
i
can
do
what
he
wants
so
phyllis
is
learning
many
things
and
preparing
for
the
great
work
that
has
so
wonderfully
come
to
her
i
think
she
will
do
it
well
because
she
is
not
at
all
stupid
really
and
she
has
the
gift
of
being
sorry
for
sad
people
and
happy
with
happy
ones
i
think
sir
christopher
chose
well
some
distant
relations
of
sir
christopher
have
tried
to
make
out
that
he
was
mad
and
so
could
do
what
he
liked
with
his
money
but
when
they
took
the
matter
to
the
judges
to
decide
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
he
had
been
good
to
and
helped
broke
the
promise
of
secrecy
that
he
had
always
asked
of
them
and
all
england
rang
with
the
tale
of
his
goodness
and
of
all
the
kind
and
clever
things
he
had
done
for
poor
children
all
those
long
years
for
the
sake
of
his
own
little
child
and
the
judges
decided
he
was
quite
right
to
use
his
money
in
that
way
and
not
mad
at
all
so
the
tiresome
relations
got
nothing
but
lawyers
bills
for
their
pains
phyllis
only
saw
sir
christopher
once
again
he
sent
for
her
when
he
was
dying
they
had
moved
his
bed
into
the
pearly
room
and
he
lay
facing
the
green
curtain
it
seems
too
hard
when
the
time
comes
he
said
need
not
do
the
work
your
father
knows
how
to
arrange
that
need
be
afraid
said
phyllis
the
most
splendid
chance
anyone
ever
had
me
dear
he
said
then
draw
back
the
curtain
but
before
phyllis
hand
had
touched
the
green
curtain
he
sat
up
in
the
bed
and
held
out
his
arms
towards
the
picture
ladybird
he
cried
his
face
all
alight
with
love
and
joy
my
little
girl
muscadel
of
course
there
was
a
grand
party
when
princess
pandora
came
of
age
the
palace
was
hung
with
garlands
of
white
roses
all
the
carpets
were
taken
up
and
the
floor
of
every
room
was
covered
close
with
green
turf
with
daisies
in
it
for
in
that
country
the
cruel
practice
of
rooting
daisies
out
of
lawns
with
a
spud
was
a
crime
the
had
died
when
pandora
was
a
little
baby
so
now
the
princess
had
to
be
hostess
and
to
receive
all
the
guests
and
speak
to
each
one
a
little
and
see
that
everyone
had
enough
to
eat
and
the
right
sort
of
person
to
talk
to
she
did
it
all
very
nicely
indeed
for
she
was
a
properly
brought
up
princess
and
had
been
to
a
school
for
the
daughters
of
monarchs
only
where
every
wednesday
evening
she
and
her
were
taught
manners
and
how
to
behave
at
court
all
the
guests
went
away
very
pleased
with
her
and
with
themselves
which
is
how
people
ought
always
to
feel
after
a
party
when
they
had
all
gone
she
went
and
curled
up
at
the
feet
of
her
father
who
had
sunk
back
on
his
throne
exhausted
by
his
hospitable
exertions
the
two
were
quite
alone
except
for
a
particularly
fine
who
had
settled
on
the
back
of
the
throne
just
above
the
carved
royal
arms
of
course
neither
the
king
nor
the
princess
noticed
such
a
little
thing
as
a
fly
daddy
dear
said
the
princess
it
go
off
all
right
did
i
behave
prettily
said
the
king
a
born
princess
my
pet
pretty
face
pretty
manners
good
heart
good
head
you
your
dear
mother
over
again
and
that
reminds
me
said
the
princess
your
mother
died
said
the
king
and
he
sighed
though
it
was
years
to
a
day
since
he
had
lost
his
promised
her
to
lock
up
her
apartments
and
only
to
give
the
keys
of
them
to
you
when
you
should
be
and
now
you
so
here
are
the
keys
my
precious
you
always
wanted
to
explore
the
rooms
in
the
south
wing
well
now
you
can
lovely
cried
the
princess
jumping
up
you
come
too
daddy
rather
not
dear
said
the
king
so
sadly
that
pandora
at
once
said
then
wo
either
i
stay
with
you
but
the
king
said
and
she
had
better
take
a
housemaid
or
two
with
brooms
and
dusters
dust
grows
thick
in
years
said
he
but
the
princess
did
want
any
of
the
palace
housemaids
to
help
her
to
explore
her
mother
rooms
she
went
alone
holding
up
her
train
because
of
the
dust
and
the
rooms
that
she
unlocked
with
the
six
gold
keys
with
pearls
in
their
handles
were
very
dusty
indeed
the
windows
were
yellow
with
dust
so
the
princess
threw
them
all
open
and
then
even
through
the
dust
she
could
see
how
beautiful
the
rooms
were
far
more
beautiful
even
than
her
own
and
everyone
had
always
said
that
hers
were
the
most
beautiful
rooms
in
the
seven
kingdoms
she
dusted
the
tops
of
a
few
of
the
tables
and
cabinets
with
her
lace
handkerchief
so
that
she
could
just
see
how
everything
was
inlaid
with
ivory
and
jade
and
ebony
and
precious
stones
six
of
the
keys
the
pearly
ones
opened
six
beautiful
rooms
but
the
seventh
had
rubies
in
its
handle
and
it
was
a
little
little
key
not
at
all
like
a
so
pandora
looked
about
for
a
little
keyhole
that
the
key
would
fit
and
at
last
she
found
a
cabinet
of
ebony
inlaid
with
gold
and
red
tortoiseshell
and
the
little
seventh
key
just
fitted
through
the
opening
of
the
gold
and
into
the
keyhole
pandora
turned
the
key
and
opened
the
cabinet
inside
the
cabinet
were
seven
little
drawers
with
gold
handles
set
with
rubies
like
the
key
pandora
pulled
the
drawers
out
one
after
the
other
she
was
alone
except
for
the
who
had
followed
her
and
now
sat
on
the
top
of
the
cabinet
door
watching
her
with
all
his
hundreds
of
eyes
but
no
one
notices
a
fly
five
of
the
drawers
contained
jewels
the
first
was
full
of
necklaces
the
second
held
rings
and
brooches
the
third
had
tiaras
and
chaplets
the
fourth
girdles
and
the
fifth
bracelets
and
they
were
all
of
the
most
beautiful
jewels
in
the
world
rubies
sapphires
emeralds
pearls
and
diamonds
and
opals
and
many
other
stones
that
the
princess
did
not
even
know
the
names
of
in
the
sixth
drawer
was
a
dry
brown
wreath
that
fell
to
pieces
as
pandora
lifted
it
it
had
been
jasmine
once
and
the
queen
had
worn
it
at
her
wedding
illustration
the
drawer
was
just
one
jewelled
ring
it
lay
on
a
written
page
page
and
in
the
seventh
drawer
was
just
one
jewelled
ring
it
lay
on
a
written
page
the
princess
read
the
writing
ring
is
for
my
son
wife
or
for
my
daughter
if
i
have
no
son
it
is
the
magic
ring
given
thousands
of
years
ago
to
a
queen
of
this
country
it
has
the
power
of
changing
the
wearer
into
whatever
shapes
he
chooses
but
it
has
never
been
used
because
the
kings
of
this
country
have
always
been
so
good
and
kind
and
clever
and
beloved
that
their
wives
could
never
think
of
any
change
that
would
not
be
a
change
for
the
worse
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
that
this
jewel
can
not
touch
or
change
and
this
is
of
all
things
in
the
world
the
most
important
thing
pandora
kissed
the
written
words
and
slipped
the
ring
on
to
her
finger
it
was
a
wonderful
stone
like
a
sapphire
that
had
tried
to
change
into
an
opal
and
stopped
halfway
there
was
not
a
happier
princess
living
than
pandora
yet
she
was
not
afraid
of
change
girls
are
like
this
sometimes
and
she
was
very
young
for
her
age
she
stood
looking
at
the
ring
and
turning
it
on
her
finger
and
the
fly
watched
her
with
all
its
hundreds
of
eyes
now
you
will
perhaps
have
guessed
that
this
fly
was
not
an
ordinary
fly
and
you
are
right
but
if
you
think
he
was
an
enchanted
prince
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
are
wrong
the
fly
was
simply
the
cleverest
fly
of
all
flies
someone
must
be
the
cleverest
in
any
society
you
know
and
he
was
just
clever
enough
to
like
to
be
where
the
princess
was
and
to
look
at
her
beauty
with
all
his
hundreds
of
eyes
he
was
clever
enough
to
like
this
and
to
know
that
he
liked
it
but
he
was
not
clever
enough
to
know
why
so
now
as
the
princess
stood
fingering
her
ring
and
trying
to
make
her
mind
up
he
gave
an
interested
buzz
and
the
princess
jumped
she
said
only
a
horrid
fly
but
it
has
wings
it
must
be
lovely
to
have
wings
i
wish
i
were
a
fairy
no
bigger
than
that
fly
and
instantly
she
and
her
gown
and
her
silver
shoes
and
the
magic
ring
and
everything
about
her
grew
suddenly
small
till
she
was
just
as
big
as
the
fly
and
no
bigger
and
that
is
size
silver
gauze
wings
grew
out
of
her
shoulders
she
felt
them
unfolding
slowly
like
a
wings
when
he
first
comes
out
of
that
dull
brown
coat
of
his
that
has
any
she
gave
a
tiny
shriek
of
joyous
surprise
and
fluttered
out
through
the
open
window
and
down
across
the
marble
terraces
to
the
palace
flowergarden
the
fly
buzzed
heavily
after
her
pandora
fluttered
among
roses
and
lilies
on
her
bright
light
white
wings
but
presently
she
was
tired
because
flying
is
much
harder
work
than
you
would
think
especially
when
you
have
not
been
brought
up
to
it
from
a
child
so
she
looked
about
for
a
place
to
rest
in
and
saw
near
her
the
cool
pink
cave
of
a
foxglove
flower
she
alighted
on
its
lip
folded
her
wings
and
walked
in
on
her
little
fairy
feet
it
was
very
pleasant
inside
the
foxglove
the
princess
sat
down
by
a
drop
of
dew
which
was
quite
a
pool
to
the
tiny
lady
and
presently
she
took
off
her
rings
and
laid
them
on
the
smooth
floor
of
the
pink
cave
and
began
to
dabble
her
hands
in
the
the
fly
had
settled
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
flower
and
watched
her
with
all
his
hundreds
of
eyes
and
now
the
dreadful
thing
happened
pandora
her
hands
and
face
wet
with
dew
suddenly
saw
the
daylight
darken
at
the
entrance
of
her
foxglove
cave
then
a
monster
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
eyes
came
quickly
towards
her
on
its
six
legs
pandora
was
very
frightened
and
squeezed
herself
close
to
the
back
of
her
cave
the
fly
moved
on
and
quickly
picked
up
the
magic
ring
now
so
tiny
that
it
fitted
nicely
on
to
one
of
its
front
feet
next
moment
it
had
backed
out
of
the
foxglove
taking
the
ring
with
it
and
had
flown
off
and
the
princess
was
left
alone
if
she
cried
a
little
you
can
hardly
blame
her
you
wait
till
you
find
yourself
one
million
three
hundred
thousand
two
hundred
and
times
as
small
as
you
usually
are
with
no
means
whatever
of
getting
back
to
your
proper
size
then
you
understand
how
the
princess
felt
but
she
was
a
brave
princess
so
she
soon
stopped
crying
spread
her
gauzy
wings
and
flew
across
the
garden
and
up
over
the
marble
terraces
and
in
at
the
library
window
of
the
palace
the
king
was
reading
the
account
of
the
in
the
evening
paper
and
he
did
not
notice
the
princess
at
all
till
she
settled
on
his
ear
then
he
put
up
his
hand
to
brush
her
away
for
he
thought
she
was
a
fly
she
dodged
his
hand
and
settled
again
and
shouted
into
his
ear
as
loud
as
ever
she
could
and
the
shout
was
no
louder
than
a
fly
buzzing
but
as
it
was
close
to
his
ear
the
king
heard
it
very
distinctly
illustration
monster
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
eyes
page
my
soul
said
the
king
sitting
very
bolt
upright
move
daddy
said
the
tiny
princess
if
i
tickle
your
ear
with
my
wings
i
found
a
magic
jewel
in
one
of
dear
mother
cabinets
and
i
made
it
turn
me
into
a
fairy
and
now
a
horrid
fly
has
buzzed
off
with
the
jewel
and
i
ca
get
back
to
my
right
size
must
be
dreaming
said
the
king
wish
you
were
i
mean
i
wish
i
was
but
it
true
i
settle
on
your
hand
now
and
you
see
the
king
looked
at
the
tiny
winged
thing
size
that
settled
on
his
hand
and
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
looked
again
and
then
he
got
a
and
looked
through
that
he
said
certainly
is
you
what
a
thing
to
happen
and
on
your
birthday
too
oh
dear
oh
dear
rather
hard
daddy
said
the
poor
princess
you
are
so
wise
and
clever
you
be
able
to
get
me
back
to
my
right
size
again
dear
said
the
king
received
a
thorough
commercial
education
but
i
never
learned
magic
in
fact
i
doubt
whether
it
is
still
taught
even
at
oxford
dear
the
princess
shyly
read
a
good
many
books
about
magic
they
called
you
know
and
said
the
king
who
saw
at
once
what
she
meant
course
i
shall
do
that
first
thing
and
next
morning
all
the
newspapers
contained
an
advertisement
competent
prince
to
undo
magic
and
restore
princesses
to
their
right
size
none
but
eldest
sons
need
apply
the
usual
reward
offered
apply
at
the
palace
think
a
mistake
daddy
said
the
princess
the
fairy
stories
it
always
the
youngest
son
who
makes
everything
come
right
and
people
do
know
their
fairy
history
nowadays
they
may
know
what
the
reward
is
so
the
next
day
the
advertisement
was
changed
to
sons
of
respectable
monarchs
may
apply
the
successful
candidate
will
receive
the
princess
hand
in
marriage
all
very
well
to
put
that
in
said
the
princess
to
herself
if
i
do
like
him
i
sha
marry
him
i
give
him
all
my
jewels
instead
but
all
the
kings
sons
in
the
world
had
forgotten
their
magic
if
they
ever
knew
any
and
not
one
single
prince
applied
at
the
palace
so
the
princess
had
to
do
the
only
possible
thing
make
the
best
of
it
and
she
did
it
bravely
now
when
the
fly
whose
name
by
the
way
was
muscadel
flew
off
from
the
with
the
magic
jewel
on
his
feathery
foot
he
flew
straight
to
the
princess
boudoir
and
settled
down
on
his
favourite
spot
the
corner
of
the
frame
of
her
mirror
and
there
he
sat
and
wondered
how
he
could
best
use
the
magic
jewel
and
he
thought
so
hard
that
he
never
noticed
a
large
spider
who
spun
a
web
right
across
the
corner
where
he
sat
and
when
he
spread
his
wings
to
assist
his
meditations
by
a
little
exercise
he
was
caught
in
the
web
said
the
spider
smiling
greedily
dear
oh
dear
said
the
fly
nice
you
look
said
the
spider
then
very
slowly
and
carefully
she
began
to
move
towards
him
a
terrible
thing
it
is
to
be
a
fly
said
he
wish
i
was
a
spider
and
of
course
instantly
he
was
he
broke
the
web
and
scrambled
down
the
mirror
for
he
was
still
horribly
frightened
of
the
other
spider
he
got
out
of
the
window
and
down
into
the
garden
and
hid
himself
under
a
leaf
of
a
burdock
which
was
there
because
the
gardener
was
a
lazy
fellow
and
neglected
his
business
but
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
before
muscadel
had
got
his
breath
after
the
shock
of
that
dreadful
web
he
saw
a
slow
creature
with
bright
yellow
eyes
quite
close
to
him
it
was
a
toad
and
he
knew
that
toads
eat
spiders
a
spider
life
is
worth
living
he
cried
wish
i
was
a
toad
and
of
course
he
was
for
the
magic
jewel
was
still
on
his
front
foot
now
that
muscadel
was
a
toad
he
felt
he
should
like
to
find
a
quiet
damp
place
to
live
in
so
he
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
basin
of
the
palace
fountain
and
when
he
had
found
a
nice
damp
crack
in
the
marble
he
squeezed
in
and
stayed
there
for
some
days
but
one
day
when
he
went
out
for
a
breath
of
air
and
a
woodlouse
or
two
a
great
beak
clattered
quite
near
him
and
startled
him
so
that
he
nearly
jumped
out
of
his
toad
skin
the
person
with
a
beak
was
a
stork
and
muscadel
knew
what
the
stork
wanted
a
toad
life
is
a
dog
life
said
muscadel
wish
i
was
a
stork
so
he
was
a
stork
and
the
magic
jewel
grown
bigger
was
round
his
right
leg
it
was
fine
to
be
a
stork
and
he
did
not
envy
even
the
golden
eagle
that
flew
down
to
drink
at
the
fountain
and
when
the
eagle
came
within
a
yard
or
two
of
him
he
felt
so
large
and
brave
that
he
said
to
your
own
side
will
you
where
are
you
shoving
to
the
golden
eagle
whose
temper
is
very
short
looked
at
him
with
evil
golden
eyes
and
said
soon
see
where
i
am
shoving
to
and
flew
at
him
muscadel
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
that
might
cost
him
his
life
what
the
good
of
being
a
stork
he
said
wish
i
was
an
eagle
and
as
soon
as
he
was
one
he
flew
away
leaving
the
other
eagle
with
its
beak
open
in
amazement
too
much
of
a
heap
as
he
told
his
wife
afterwards
to
follow
the
new
bird
and
finish
off
their
quarrel
in
the
air
how
grand
it
is
to
be
an
eagle
said
muscadel
sailing
on
widespread
wings
and
just
as
he
said
it
an
arrow
caught
him
under
the
left
wing
it
hurt
horribly
a
powerful
thing
an
arrow
is
he
said
me
how
it
hurts
i
wish
i
was
an
arrow
so
he
was
one
but
he
was
an
arrow
in
the
quiver
of
a
very
stupid
bowman
who
shot
next
day
at
a
buzzard
and
missed
it
so
the
arrow
which
was
muscadel
lodged
high
in
an
and
the
stupid
bowman
could
not
get
it
down
again
do
like
being
a
slave
to
a
mere
bow
said
muscadel
be
a
bow
myself
but
when
he
was
a
bow
the
archer
who
owned
him
hurt
his
so
in
fitting
him
with
a
new
string
that
he
got
very
cross
and
said
is
worse
slavery
than
the
other
i
want
to
be
an
archer
so
he
was
an
archer
and
as
it
happened
he
was
one
of
the
archers
the
magic
jewel
was
round
his
arm
like
a
bracelet
and
no
one
saw
it
for
he
kept
it
hidden
up
his
arm
under
the
sleeve
of
his
buff
coat
now
that
muscadel
was
a
man
of
course
he
read
the
newspapers
and
in
them
he
saw
the
king
advertisement
which
was
still
appearing
every
day
me
said
muscadel
course
the
princess
could
get
back
to
her
right
size
when
i
had
taken
the
magic
jewel
away
i
never
thought
of
that
flies
are
thoughtless
little
things
and
by
the
way
taking
that
jewel
was
stealing
very
wrong
indeed
but
i
did
know
that
when
i
was
a
fly
so
not
a
thief
and
no
more
was
the
fly
because
he
know
any
better
that
evening
he
had
a
little
talk
with
the
captain
of
the
archers
and
in
the
morning
the
captain
called
on
the
king
very
early
and
said
there
a
chap
among
my
archers
who
says
he
can
make
the
princess
her
right
size
again
of
course
it
all
your
majesty
if
i
may
be
pardoned
the
expression
but
i
thought
your
majesty
would
like
to
know
let
him
try
said
the
king
wearily
something
to
find
someone
who
even
thinks
he
can
do
it
so
next
day
muscadel
the
archer
put
on
his
sunday
clothes
and
went
up
to
the
palace
and
a
great
burly
fellow
he
was
the
king
and
all
the
court
were
assembled
to
see
the
archer
make
the
princess
her
own
size
again
though
nobody
believed
he
could
do
it
the
king
was
on
his
throne
and
pandora
still
size
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
carved
gold
flowers
that
adorned
the
right
arm
the
archer
bowed
to
the
king
and
the
court
and
to
the
princess
though
he
could
not
see
her
then
he
looked
round
the
crowded
and
said
here
your
majesty
this
will
never
do
said
the
king
ca
be
done
in
this
sort
of
public
way
i
must
be
left
alone
with
the
princess
no
i
ca
have
anyone
bothering
round
not
even
you
your
majesty
the
king
was
rather
offended
but
the
princess
got
to
his
ear
and
whispered
and
then
he
gave
the
order
for
the
to
be
cleared
and
when
that
was
done
he
set
the
tiny
princess
on
the
table
and
went
away
himself
and
shut
the
door
honourably
behind
him
illustration
on
the
table
stood
the
dazzling
figure
of
a
real
princess
page
then
the
archer
said
princess
you
can
be
made
your
right
size
again
if
you
will
do
just
what
i
tell
you
do
you
promise
the
princess
little
voice
said
then
said
the
archer
have
got
the
jewel
here
that
the
fly
stole
from
you
and
i
will
lend
it
to
you
and
you
can
wish
yourself
again
and
then
you
must
give
me
back
the
jewel
the
jewel
was
stolen
you
no
right
to
it
i
shall
call
the
guard
said
pandora
angrily
would
hear
you
little
princess
if
you
did
call
said
the
archer
i
call
them
for
you
if
you
like
only
you
promised
i
did
said
the
princess
lend
me
the
jewel
he
took
it
off
his
arm
and
laid
it
upon
the
table
and
as
soon
as
the
princess
touched
it
it
grew
small
small
small
so
that
she
could
put
it
on
her
finger
then
she
said
wish
i
were
my
right
size
again
and
the
archer
rubbed
his
eyes
for
there
on
the
table
stood
the
dazzling
figure
of
a
real
princess
in
a
gown
and
a
face
more
beautiful
than
the
morning
how
lovely
you
are
he
said
and
gave
her
his
hand
to
help
her
down
she
jumped
lightly
from
the
table
and
stood
before
him
laughing
with
joy
at
being
her
own
real
right
size
once
more
thank
you
thank
you
she
cried
must
run
and
show
my
father
this
very
minute
jewel
said
the
archer
said
pandora
yes
i
did
promise
but
well
i
a
princess
of
my
word
here
it
is
she
held
it
out
but
he
did
not
take
it
may
keep
it
for
ever
and
ever
princess
dear
he
said
you
will
only
marry
me
i
ca
she
cried
never
going
to
marry
anyone
unless
i
love
him
more
than
all
the
world
feel
as
if
i
loved
you
all
my
lives
said
muscadel
my
life
i
mean

you
wish
to
love
me

think
i
want
to
said
the
princess
doubtfully
i
must
have
the
jewel
i
find
some
way
yet
of
making
you
love
me
and
then
you
shall
have
it
for
ever
and

she

i
should
mind
your
having
red
hair
and
a
red
face
and
red
ears
and
red
hands
should
i
a
bit
said
the
archer
cheerfully
she
stood
there
twisting
the
magic
jewel
round
and
round
on
her
royal
finger
suppose
it
more
important
than
anything
else
to
love
someone
she
said
said
he
then
said
she
are
you
the
sort
of
person
i
ought
to
love
said
he
not
half
good
enough
for
you
but
then
nobody
is
nice
of
you
anyhow
she
said
do
it
i
wish
i
loved
you
there
was
a
silence
then
pandora
said

i
feel
just
the
same
as
usual
your
hair
and
hands
and
face
and
ears

redder
than
ever
excuse
my
candour
wo

nothing
for

but
for
me
to
wish

to
love
you
said
muscadel
i
really
ca
bear
loving
you
to
this
desperate
degree
when
you
do
care
a
snap
of
your
royal
fingers
for
me

the
jewel
a
moment

a
archer
so

the
princess

said

the
princess
one
thing
that

of
person

silly
of

a
stupid
magic
jewel

of
person
the
person

as
cruel
as

said
muscadel

or
other

to
love
me
afterwards
i
will
call
the
king
so
he
went
to
the
door
and
shouted

a
moment

please
and
his
majesty
stepped
here

said
the
princess

a
kiss
illustration
blowzy
frowzy
dairymaid
page
when
this
was
done
she
said
very
quickly
and
before
the
king
could
stop
her
wish
i
was
the
kind
of
person
that
could
love
this
archer
and
then
and
there
before
the
horrified
eyes
of
the
other
two
the
princess
turned
into
the
kind
of
person
who
could
love
the
archer
my
soul
and
body
said
the
king
turning
purple
my
heart
said
muscadel
turning
white
for
the
kind
of
person
the
princess
had
changed
into
was
a
blowzy
frowzy
dairymaid
with
oily
black
hair
and
shining
red
cheeks
and
little
black
eyes
like
the
currant
eyes
in
gingerbread
pigs
her
hands
were
fat
and
red
and
her
feet
would
not
bear
looking
at
for
a
moment
old
muscadel
said
the
dairymaid
that
pandora
had
turned
into
we
be
married
and
live
as
happy
as
two
mice
in
a
cheese
in
this
world
cried
muscadel
snatching
the
ring
from
her
hand
which
was
not
manners
but
we
must
remember
that
he
was
very
much
upset
he
snatched
the
ring
and
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
palace
and
when
he
got
to
the
archers
quarters
he
flung
himself
face
down
among
the
rushes
on
the
floor
and
lay
there
till
his
comrades
began
to
mock
him
and
even
to
kick
him
as
he
lay
and
then
he
got
up
and
fought
them
with
his
red
fists
one
down
come
on
till
seven
of
them
had
owned
that
they
did
not
want
any
more
dear
oh
dear
said
the
king
in
his
palace
rather
have
had
you
size
for
life
than
like
this
we
must
get
back
the
jewel
and
make
you
into
your
old
self
a
bit
of
it
said
the
dairymaid
princess
never
was
so
happy
in
my
life
i
love
that
lovely
archer
and
if
i
a
princess
you
can
order
him
to
marry
me
and
he
have
to
said
the
king
do
seem
to
love
like
princesses
do
dare
say
not
said
she
we
know
our
own
minds
i
tell
you
happy
governor
and
i
stay
as
i
am
the
dairymaid
princess
called
for
cold
pork
and
cheese
and
beer
and
having
had
quite
enough
of
all
three
she
went
to
bed
in
the
green
and
white
bedroom
now
when
all
the
archers
had
gone
to
sleep
poor
muscadel
stole
out
and
wandered
through
the
palace
gardens
and
looked
at
the
white
fountains
rising
and
falling
in
the
moonlight
he
saw
the
white
lilies
sleeping
standing
up
just
like
real
live
sentinels
he
saw
the
white
roosting
in
the
and
the
white
swans
cuddled
up
among
the
reeds
by
the
lake
he
went
hither
and
thither
through
the
cold
white
beauty
of
the
night
and
he
thought
and
thought
but
he
could
not
think
any
thought
that
was
worth
the
trouble
of
thinking
and
at
last
he
sat
down
on
a
marble
bench
and
very
nearly
wished
that
he
were
dead
not
quite
of
course
because
people
very
seldom
do
that
and
if
he
had
there
would
have
been
an
end
to
this
story
the
silence
and
the
moonlight
soothed
him
his
poor
brain
felt
clearer
and
brighter
and
at
last
he
had
the
sense
to
say
without
at
all
knowing
that
he
was
saying
anything
sensible
wish
i
was
clever
and
instantly
he
was
the
change
was
so
great
so
sudden
and
so
violent
that
it
nearly
choked
him
he
drew
two
or
three
difficult
breaths
and
then
he
said
i
see
how
stupid
of
me
i
wish
i
were
the
kind
of
person
the
real
princess
could
love
and
he
felt
his
body
change
he
grew
thinner
and
his
face
seemed
to
grow
a
different
shape
he
hastened
to
the
lake
and
leaned
over
it
and
saw
by
the
moonlight
the
reflection
of
his
own
face
in
the
water
it
was
not
particularly
handsome
but
he
was
not
ashamed
of
the
eyes
largish
nose
and
firm
lips
and
chin
that
the
sort
of
man
she
could
love
he
said
and
went
home
to
bed
like
a
sensible
person
early
in
the
morning
he
went
out
into
the
palace
garden
and
it
was
not
all
gray
and
white
as
it
had
been
the
night
before
with
moonlight
and
white
lilies
but
gold
and
red
with
sunshine
and
roses
and
hollyhocks
and
carnations
he
went
and
waited
under
the
princess
window
for
he
had
grown
clever
enough
to
know
that
the
princess
since
she
was
now
a
dairymaid
would
be
awake
betimes
and
sure
enough

green

curtains
were
presently
drawn
back
and
the
drowsy
blowzy
frowzy
face
of
the
dairymaid
looked
out
she
said
to
muscadel
among
the
roses
are
up
to
am
the
archer
you
love
said
muscadel
among
the
roses
you
she
said
indeed
said
he
illustration
you
got
a
face
as
long
as
a
fiddle
page
said
the
dairymaid
you
love
me
like
this
said
muscadel
a
bit
said
she
along
do
you
got
a
face
as
long
as
a
fiddle
and
i
never
could
abide
black
hair
going
to
stay
like
this
said
he
what
to
become
of
me
she
asked
and
waited
for
an
answer
with
her
mouth
half
open
tell
you
said
muscadel
can
stay
as
you
are
all
your
life
and
go
on
loving
an
archer
who
is
anywhere
at
all
or
i
lend
you
the
magic
jewel
and
then
you
can
change
back
into
the
princess
and
when
you
the
princess
you
love
me
ever
so
much
more
than
you
ever
loved
the
archer
said
the
dairymaid
fingering
the
princess
pearl
necklace
if
my
dear
archer
really
is
any
more
anywhere
as
you
say
the
really
important
thing
is
to
love
someone
although
she
was
a
silly
dairymaid
she
had
the
sense
to
see
that
me
the
jewel
she
said
he
threw
it
up
and
she
caught
it
overhand
put
it
on
and
said
wish
i
was
the
princess
again
and
there
was
the
princess
leaning
out
of
the
window
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
at
me
said
muscadel
i
the
sort
of
person
you
could
love
do
know
said
pandora
peeping
at
him
between
her
rosy
had
better
ask
papa
rather
ask
you
said
muscadel
as
he
climbed
up
the
palace
ivy
and
leaned
in
at
her
to
ask
her
and
she
leaned
out
to
answer
him
they
were
married
the
very
next
day
and
everyone
in
the
kingdom
rich
and
poor
had
roast
beef
and
for
dinner
and
as
soon
as
the
wedding
was
over
muscadel
and
his
bride
went
down
to
the
lake
and
he
threw
the
magic
jewel
far
far
out
it
gleamed
redly
as
it
flew
through
the
sunlit
air
and
with
a
tiny
splash
sank
in
the
lake
and
there
it
is
to
this
day
you
might
try
to
find
it
one
of
these
days
when
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
i
dare
say
you
often
feel
that
you
would
like
to
change
from
what
you
are
into
something
else
and
for
anything
i
know
it
might
be
a
very
good
thing
for
you
and
for
the
rest
of
the
world
but
pandora
and
muscadel
were
so
happy
at
belonging
to
each
other
that
they
never
wished
to
change
at
all
so
they
did
not
want
the
magic
ring
and
that
is
why
they
threw
it
away
for
as
all
good
housekeepers
know
it
is
very
foolish
to
keep
useless
things
about
just
to
litter
the
house
