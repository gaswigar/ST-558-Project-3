the
himalaya
club
it
is
some
eighteen
years
since
this
institution
was
founded
at
mussoorie
one
of
the
chief
sanataria
in
the
himalaya
mountains
here
all
those
who
can
obtain
leave
and
who
can
afford
the
additional
expense
repair
to
escape
the
hot
weather
of
the
plains
the
season
begins
about
the
end
of
april
and
ends
about
the
first
week
in
october
the
club
is
open
to
the
members
of
the
civil
and
military
services
to
the
members
of
the
bar
the
clergy
and
to
such
other
private
gentlemen
as
are
on
the
government
house
list
which
signifies
in
society
the
is
neither
an
expensive
nor
an
elegant
edifice
but
it
answers
the
purposes
required
of
it
it
has
two
large
rooms
one
on
the
and
the
other
on
the
upper
story
the
lower
room
which
is
some
sixty
feet
long
by
wide
is
the
and
the
upper
room
is
the
reading
and
the
the
club
has
also
its
which
is
built
on
the
ledge
of
a
precipice
and
its
stables
which
would
astonish
most
persons
in
europe
no
horses
except
those
educated
in
india
would
crawl
into
these
holes
cut
out
of
the
earth
and
rock
facing
the
is
a
platform
about
forty
yards
long
by
fifteen
feet
wide
and
from
it
on
a
clear
day
the
eye
commands
one
of
the
grandest
scenes
in
the
known
world
in
the
distance
are
plainly
visible
the
eternal
snows
at
your
feet
are
a
number
of
hills
covered
with
trees
of
luxuriant
foliage
amongst
them
is
the
rhododendron
which
grows
to
an
immense
height
and
size
and
is
when
in
bloom
literally
covered
with
flowers
on
every
hill
on
a
level
with
the
club
and
within
a
mile
of
it
a
house
is
to
be
seen
to
which
access
would
seem
impossible
these
houses
are
for
the
most
part
whitened
without
as
well
as
within
and
nothing
can
exceed
in
prettiness
their
aspect
as
they
shine
in
the
sun
from
the
back
of
the
from
your
windows
there
are
sets
of
apartments
you
have
a
view
of
deyrah
dhoon
it
appears
about
a
mile
off
it
is
seven
miles
distant
the
plains
that
lie
outstretched
below
the
simplon
bear
in
point
of
extent
and
beauty
to
the
indian
scene
nothing
like
the
proportion
which
the
comparatively
pigmy
mont
blanc
bears
to
the
dewalgiri
from
an
elevation
of
about
seven
thousand
feet
the
eye
embraces
a
plain
containing
millions
of
acres
intersected
by
broad
streams
to
the
left
and
inclosed
by
a
low
belt
of
hills
called
the
pass
the
dhoon
in
various
parts
is
dotted
with
clumps
of
jungle
abounding
with
tigers
pheasants
and
every
species
of
game
in
the
broad
tributaries
to
the
ganges
and
the
jumna
may
be
caught
with
a
fly
the
m√¢hseer
the
leviathan
salmon
beyond
the
pass
of
which
i
have
spoken
you
see
the
plains
of
hindoostan
while
you
are
wrapped
in
a
great
coat
and
are
shivering
with
the
cold
you
may
see
the
heat
and
the
steam
it
occasions
with
us
on
the
hills
the
thermometer
is
at
with
those
poor
fellows
over
there
it
is
at
degrees
we
can
scarcely
keep
ourselves
warm
for
the
wind
comes
from
the
snowy
range
they
can
not
breathe
except
beneath
a
punkah
that
steam
is
as
the
crow
flies
not
more
than
forty
miles
from
us
we
are
all
idlers
at
mussoorie
we
are
all
sick
or
supposed
to
be
so
or
we
have
leave
on
private
affairs
some
of
us
are
up
here
for
a
month
between
musters
we
are
in
the
good
graces
of
our
colonel
and
our
general
the
general
of
our
division
a
very
good
old
gentleman
let
us
go
into
the
public
room
and
have
breakfast
for
it
is
nine
and
the
bell
has
rung
there
are
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
at
the
table
these
are
the
early
risers
who
walk
or
ride
round
the
camel
back
every
morning
the
camel
back
being
a
huge
mountain
encircled
about
its
middle
by
a
good
road
the
majority
of
the
club
members
are
asleep
and
will
defer
breakfast
until
tiffin
time
two
at
that
hour
the
gathering
will
be
great
how
these
early
risers
eat
to
be
sure
there
is
the
major
who
if
you
believe
him
has
every
complaint
mentioned
in
graham
domestic
medicine
has
just
devoured
two
thighs
grilled
of
a
turkey
and
is
now
asking
captain
blossom
opinion
of
the
irish
stew
while
he
is
cutting
into
a
let
us
now
while
away
the
morning
let
us
call
on
some
of
the
grass
widows
there
are
lots
of
them
here
civil
and
military
let
us
go
first
to
merrydale
the
wife
of
our
old
friend
charley
of
the
two
hundredth
and
tenth
regiment
poor
fellow
he
could
not
get
leave
and
the
doctors
said
another
hot
summer
in
the
plains
would
be
the
death
of
his
wife
they
are
seven
hundred
pounds
in
debt
to
the
agra
bank
and
are
hard
put
to
it
to
live
and
pay
the
monthly
instalments
of
interest
charley
is
only
a
lieutenant
what
terrible
infants
are
these
little
merrydales
there
is
lieutenant
maxwell
pony
under
the
trees
and
if
these
children
had
not
shouted
out
mamma
mamma
here
is
captain
wall
sahib
i
should
have
been
informed
that
merrydale
was
not
at
home
or
was
poorly
which
i
should
have
believed
implicitly
maxwell
when
a
young
ensign
was
once
engaged
to
be
married
to
julia
dacey
now
merrydale
but
her
parents
would
not
hear
of
it
for
some
reason
or
other
as
it
is
we
must
be
admitted
we
will
not
stay
long
merrydale
is
writing
to
her
husband
grass
widows
in
the
hills
are
always
writing
to
their
husbands
when
you
drop
in
upon
them
and
your
presence
is
not
actually
delighted
in
how
beautiful
she
looks
now
that
the
mountain
breezes
have
chased
from
her
cheeks
the
pallor
which
lately
clung
to
them
in
the
plains
and
the
fresh
air
has
imparted
to
her
spirits
an
elasticity
in
lieu
of
that
languor
by
which
she
was
oppressed
a
fortnight
ago
let
us
now
go
to
hastings
she
is
the
wife
of
a
civilian
who
has
a
salary
of
fifteen
hundred
rupees
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
per
mensem
and
who
is
a
man
of
fortune
independent
of
his
pay
hastings
has
the
best
house
in
mussoorie
she
is
surrounded
by
servants
she
has
no
less
than
three
arab
horses
to
ride
she
is
a
great
prude
is
hastings
she
has
no
patience
with
married
women
who
flirt
she
thinks
that
the
dogma
when
lovely
women
go
astray
their
stars
are
more
in
fault
than
they
is
all
nonsense
hastings
has
been
a
remarkably
fine
woman
she
is
now
and
still
good
looking
though
disposed
to
she
wearies
one
with
her
discourses
on
the
duties
of
a
wife
that
simpering
cornet
stammersleigh
is
announced
and
we
may
bid
her
good
morning
the
average
rent
for
a
furnished
house
is
about
five
hundred
rupees
fifty
pounds
for
the
six
months
every
house
has
its
name
yonder
are
cocky
hall
belvidere
phoenix
lodge
the
cliffs
the
crags
the
vale
the
eagle
nest
the
value
of
these
properties
ranges
from
five
hundred
to
fifteen
hundred
pounds
the
furniture
is
of
the
very
plainest
description
with
one
or
two
exceptions
and
is
manufactured
chiefly
at
bareilly
and
carried
here
on
men
shoulders
the
entire
distance
ninety
miles
where
shall
we
go
now
for
it
wants
an
hour
to
tiffin
time
oh
here
comes
a
janpan
a
sort
of
carried
by
four
hill
men
dressed
in
loose
black
clothes
turned
up
with
red
yellow
blue
green
or
whatever
colour
the
proprietor
likes
best
and
in
the
janpan
sits
a
lady
apsley
a
very
pretty
and
little
woman
she
is
the
of
an
english
peer
and
is
very
fond
of
quoting
her
aunts
and
her
uncles
my
aunt
lady
mary
culnerson
my
aunt
the
countess
of
tweedleford
my
uncle
lord
charles
banbury
cross
but
that
is
her
only
weakness
i
believe
and
perhaps
it
is
ungenerous
to
allude
to
it
her
husband
is
in
the
dragoons
well
apsley
whither
art
thou
going
to
pay
visits
no
i
am
going
to
ludlam
to
buy
a
new
bonnet
and
not
before
i
want
one
you
will
say
may
i
accompany
you
yes
and
assist
me
in
making
a
choice
there
is
not
a
cloud
to
be
seen
the
air
is
soft
and
balmy
the
wild
flowers
are
in
full
bloom
and
the
butterfly
is
on
the
wing
the
grasshopper
is
singing
his
ceaseless
song
and
the
bees
are
humming
a
chorus
thereto
we
are
now
at
ludlam
the
janpan
is
placed
upon
the
ground
and
i
assist
apsley
to
step
from
it
ludlam
is
the
milliner
and
dressmaker
of
upper
india
and
imports
all
her
wares
direct
from
london
and
paris
everybody
in
this
part
of
the
world
knows
ludlam
and
everybody
likes
her
she
has
by
industry
honesty
of
purpose
and
economy
amassed
a
little
fortune
and
has
brought
up
a
large
family
in
the
most
respectable
and
unpretending
style
some
people
say
that
she
sometimes
can
afford
to
sell
a
poor
ensign
wife
a
bonnet
or
a
silk
dress
at
a
price
which
hardly
pays
what
i
have
always
admired
in
ludlam
is
that
she
never
importunes
her
customers
to
buy
her
goods
nor
does
she
puff
their
quality
the
bonnet
is
bought
likewise
a
for
jack
and
we
are
now
returning
apsley
to
her
home
and
i
to
the
club
apsley
invites
me
to
dine
with
them
but
that
is
impossible
it
is
public
night
and
i
have
two
guests
one
of
them
is
jack
who
does
not
belong
to
the
club
because
mary
does
not
wish
it
apsley
says
she
wants
some
pickles
and
we
must
go
into
shop
to
purchase
them
ford

my
hand

raffle

to
be
raffled
for
a
rifle
by
purdey
the
property

yes
put
my
name

for
a
chance
ford
and
captain
apsley
please
says
the
lady
after
promising
apsley
most
faithfully
that
i
will
not
keep
jack
later
than
twelve
and
taking
another
look
into
those
sweet
eyes
of
hers
i
gallop
away
as
fast
as
the
pony
can
carry
me
i
am
late
there
is
scarcely
a
vacant
place
at
the
long
table
we
have
no
private
tables
the
same
board
shelters
the
nether
limbs
of
all
of
us
we
are
all
intimate
friends
and
know
exactly
each
circumstances
what
a
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
and
what
a
lively
conversation
it
alludes
chiefly
to
the
doings
of
the
past
night
almost
every
other
man
has
a
nickname
to
account
for
many
of
them
would
indeed
be
a
difficult
if
not
a
hopeless
task
dickey
brown
glass
of
beer
i
am
your
man
responds
major
george
fencibles
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
you
hear
the
word
shiney
shouted
out
and
responded
to
by
lieutenant
fenwick
of
the
horse
artillery
billy
sherry
adolphus
bruce
of
the
lancers
lifts
his
glass
with
immense
alacrity
it
is
a
curious
characteristic
of
indian
society
that
very
little
outward
respect
is
in
private
shown
to
seniority
i
once
heard
an
ensign
of
twenty
years
of
age
address
a
civilian
of
sixty
in
the
following
terms
now
then
old
moonsiff
pass
that
claret
please
the
tiffin
over
a
gool
or
lighted
ball
of
charcoal
is
passed
round
the
table
in
a
silver
augdan
every
man
present
lights
a
cigar
and
in
a
few
minutes
there
is
a
general
move
some
retire
to
the
others
cluster
round
the
fireplace
others
pace
the
platform
and
two
sets
go
into
the
to
have
a
quiet
rubber
from
three
till
five
those
four
men
seated
at
the
table
near
the
window
have
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
players
in
india
the
four
at
the
other
table
know
very
little
of
the
game
of
whist
mark
the
difference
the
one
set
never
speak
except
when
the
cards
are
being
dealt
the
other
set
are
finding
fault
with
one
another
during
the
progress
of
the
hand
the
good
players
are
playing
high
gold
mohur
points
five

on
the
rub
give
and
take

after
the
first
game
and
sometimes
at
game
and
game
they
bet
an
extra
five
tellwell
and
long
who
are
playing
against
bean
and
fickle
have
just
lost
a
bumper
gold

a
matter
of

four
shillings
in
the
there
is
a
match
going
on
between
four
officers
who
are
famed
for
their
skill
judgment
and
execution
heavy
bets
are
pending
how
cautiously
and
how
well
they
play
no
wonder
when
we
consider
the
number
of
hours
they
practise
and
that
they
play
every
day
of
their
lives
that
tall
man
now
about
to
strike
makes
a
revenue
out
of
billiards
i
shall
be
greatly
mistaken
if
that
man
does
not
come
to
grief
some
day
he
preys
upon
every
youngster
in
every
station
he
goes
to
with
his
regiment
he
is
a
captain
in
the
native
infantry
his
name
is
tom
locke
he
has
scored
off
the
red
ball
his
confederate
bunyan
knows
full
well
that
luck
has
little
to
do
with
his
success
he
too
will
come
to
grief
before
long
your
clever
villains
are
invariably
tripped
up
sooner
or
later
and
ignominiously
stripped
of
their
commissions
and
positions
in
society
it
is
five
some
thirty
horses
and
as
many
ponies
are
saddled
and
bridled
and
led
up
and
down
in
the
vicinity
of
the
club
everybody
will
be
on
the
mall
presently
the
mall
is
a
part
of
the
road
round
the
camel
back
it
is
a
level
of
about
half
a
mile
long
and
twelve
feet
broad
a
slight
fence
stands
between
the
riders
and
a
deep
khud
precipice
to
gallop
along
this
road
is
nothing
when
you
are
accustomed
to
it
but
at
first
it
makes
one
very
nervous
even
to
witness
it
serious
and
fatal
accidents
have
happened
but
considering
all
things
they
have
been
far
fewer
than
might
have
been
expected
the
mall
is
crowded
ladies
and
gentlemen
on
horseback
and
ladies
in
janpans
the
janpanees
dressed
in
every
variety
of
livery
men
in
the
french
grey
coats
trimmed
with
white
serge
are
carrying
hastings
men
in
the
brown
clothes
trimmed
with
yellow
serge
are
carrying
merrydale
jack
apsley
wife
is
mounted
on
her
second
charger
come
along
captain
wall
she
calls
out
to
me
and
goes
off
at
a
canter
which
soon
becomes
a
hard
gallop
i
follow
her
of
course
jack
remains
behind
to
have
a
quiet
chat
with
mrs
flower
of
his
regiment
who
thinks
and
jack
agrees
with
her
that
hard
riding
on
the
mall
is
a
nuisance
and
ought
to
be
put
a
stop
to
but
as
we
come
back
we
meet
the
hypocrite
galloping
with
a
miss
pinkerton
a
new
importation
with
whom
much
to
the
amusement
of
his
wife
he
affects
to
be
desperately
in
love
the
mall
by
the
way
is
a
great
place
for
flirtations
most
people
like
mrs
flower
not
only
think
hard
riding
on
the
mall
a
nuisance
but
make
it
the
theme
of
letters
to
the
editors
of
the
papers
and
sometimes
the
editors
will
take
the
matter
up
and
write
leading
articles
thereon
and
pointedly
allude
to
the
fact
as
did
the
late
sir
napier
in
a
general
order
that
beggars
on
horseback
usually
ride
in
the
opposite
direction
to
heaven
but
these
letters
and
leaders
rarely
have
the
desired
effect
for
what
can
a
man
do
when
a
pretty
woman
like
apsley
says
come
along
let
us
have
a
gallop
why
are
there
so
very
many
people
on
the
mall
this
evening
a
few
evenings
ago
it
was
proposed
at
the
club
that
a
band
should
play
twice
a
week
a
paper
was
sent
round
at
once
and
every
one
subscribed
a
sum
in
accordance
with
his
means
next
morning
the
required
number
of
musicians
was
hunted
up
and
engaged
two
cornets
two
flutes
two
violins
a
clarionet
a
fife
and
several
drums
it
is
the
of
may
a
day
always
celebrated
in
this
great
military
camp
as
lord
ellenborough
described
british
india
at
a
given
signal
the
band
strikes
up
god
save
the
queen
we
all
flock
round
the
band
which
has
taken
up
a
position
on
a
rock
beetling
over
the
road
the
male
portion
of
us
raise
our
hats
and
remain
uncovered
while
the
anthem
is
played
we
are
thousands
of
miles
distant
from
our
fatherland
and
our
queen
but
our
hearts
are
as
true
and
as
loyal
as
though
she
were
in
the
midst
of
us
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
himalaya
mountains
have
listened
to
the
joyous
sound
of
music
we
have
danced
to
music
within
doors
but
never
until
this
day
have
we
heard
a
band
in
the
open
air
in
the
himalaya
mountains
how
wonderful
is
the
effect
from
valley
to
valley
echo
carries
the
sound
until
at
last
it
seems
as
though
every
mountain
now
had
found
a
band
long
after
the
strain
has
ceased
with
us
we
can
hear
it
penetrating
into
and
reverberating
amidst
regions
which
the
foot
of
man
has
never
yet
trodden
and
probably
will
never
tread
the
sun
has
gone
down
but
his
light
is
still
with
us
back
to
the
club
dinner
is
served
we
sit
down
of
us
the
fare
is
excellent
and
the
champagne
has
been
iced
in
the
hail
which
fell
the
other
night
during
a
storm
jack
apsley
is
on
my
right
and
i
have
thrice
begged
of
him
to
remember
that
he
must
not
stay
later
than
twelve
and
he
has
thrice
responded
that
mary
has
given
him
an
extension
of
leave
until
daylight
jack
and
i
were
midshipmen
together
some
years
ago
in
a
ship
that
went
by
the
name
of
the
house
of
correction
and
there
is
wywell
sitting
opposite
to
us
wywell
who
was
in
the
frigate
which
belonged
to
our
squadron
the
squadron
that
went
round
the
world
and
buried
the
commodore
poor
old
sir
james
in
sydney
churchyard
fancy
we
three
meeting
again
in
the
himalaya
mountains
the
cloth
is
removed
for
the
dinner
is
over
the
president
of
the
club
the
gentleman
who
founded
it
rises
he
is
a
very
little
man
of
seventy
years
of
age
of
which
have
been
spent
in
india
he
is
far
from
feeble
and
is
in
full
possession
of
all
his
faculties
his
voice
is
not
loud
but
it
is
very
distinct
and
pierces
the
ear
they
do
not
sit
long
after
dinner
at
the
club
it
is
only
nine
and
the
members
are
already
diminishing
some
are
off
to
the
to
smoke
drink
and
look
on
at
the
play
the
whist
parties
are
now
at
work
and
seven
men
are
engaged
at
brag
a
few
remain
and
drawing
their
chairs
to
the
fireplace
form
a
ring
and
chat
cosily
halloa
what
is
this
the
is
heaving
and
pitching
like
a
ship
at
anchor
in
a
gale
of
wind
some
of
us
feel
qualmish
it
is
a
shock
of
an
earthquake
and
a
very
violent
shock
it
is
now
midnight
a
thunderstorm
is
about
to
sweep
over
mussoorie
only
look
at
that
lurid
forked
lightning
striking
yonder
hill
and
listen
to
that
thunder
while
the
storm
lasts
the
thunder
will
never
for
a
second
cease
roaring
for
long
before
the
sound
of
one
peal
has
died
away
it
will
be
succeeded
by
another
more
awful
and
now
look
at
the
dhoon
those
millions
of
acres
are
illuminated
by
incessant
sheet
lightning
how
plainly
we
discern
the
trees
and
the
streams
in
the
dhoon
and
the
outline
of
the
pass
which
divides
the
dhoon
from
the
plains
what
a
glorious
panorama
we
can
see
the
black
clouds
descending
rapidly
towards
the
dhoon
and
it
is
not
until
they
near
that
level
land
that
they
discharge
the
heavy
showers
with
which
they
are
laden
what
a
luxury
would
this
storm
be
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
plains
but
it
does
not
extend
beyond
the
dhoon
we
shall
hear
the
day
after
that
not
a
single
drop
of
rain
has
fallen
at
umballah
meerut
or
saharunpore
the
party
from
the
has
come
up
to
have
supper
now
that
the
storm
is
over
they
are
rather
noisy
but
the
take
no
heed
of
them
they
are
too
intent
upon
their
play
to
be
disturbed
two
or
three
of
the
brag
party
call
for
to
be
taken
to
the
table
and
they
devour
it
savagely
while
the
cards
are
dealt
round
placing
their
lighted
cheroots
meanwhile
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
now
there
is
singing
comic
and
sentimental
isle
of
beauty
is
followed
by
the
steam
leg
the
steam
leg
by
the
queen
of
the
may
the
queen
of
the
may
by
the
facetious
version
of
george
barnwell
and
so
on
jack
apsley
who
has
ascertained
that
dear
mary
is
quite
safe
and
not
at
all
alarmed
is
still
here
and
is
now
singing
rule
britannia
with
an
energy
and
enthusiasm
which
are
at
once
both
pleasing
and
ridiculous
to
behold
he
has
been
a
soldier
for
upwards
of
sixteen
years
but
the
sailor
still
predominates
in
his
nature
while
his
similes
have
invariably
reference
to
matters
connected
with
ships
and
the
sea
he
told
me
just
now
that
when
he
first
joined
his
regiment
he
felt
as
much
out
of
his
element
as
a
live
dolphin
in
a
and
he
has
just
described
his
present
colonel
as
a
man
who
is
as
touchy
as
a
boatswain
kitten
apsley
christian
name
is
francis
but
he
has
always
been
called
jack
and
always
will
be
it
is
now
broad
daylight
and
high
time
for
a
man
on
to
be
in
bed
how
seedy
and
disreputable
we
all
look
in
our
evening
dresses
and
boots
and
observe
this
carnation
in
my
the
gift
of
apsley
she
gave
it
to
me
on
the
mall
the
glare
of
the
lights
and
the
atmosphere
of
smoke
in
which
i
have
been
sitting
part
of
the
night
have
robbed
it
of
its
freshness
its
bloom
and
perfume
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
an
emblem
of
most
of
us
go
home
apsley
go
home
reeking
of
and
with
your
eyes
like
boiled
gooseberries
your
hair
in
frightful
disorder
go
home
you
will
probably
meet
upon
the
mall
your
three
beautiful
children
with
their
rosy
faces
all
bloom
and
their
breath
when
they
press
their
glowing
lips
to
those
feverish
cheeks
of
yours
will
smell
as
incense
and
make
you
ashamed
of
yourself
go
home
jack
i
will
tiff
with
you
at
two
two
young
gentlemen
were
victimized
last
night
at
the
brag
party
the
one
a
lieutenant
of
the
buffs
lost
six
thousand
rupees
the
other
a
lieutenant
of
the
foot
artillery
four
thousand
the
day
after
the
first
of
the
month
will
be
settling
day
how
are
they
to
meet
these
debts
of
honour
they
have
nothing
but
their
pay
and
must
borrow
from
the
banks
that
is
easily
managed
the
money
will
be
advanced
to
them
on
their
own
personal
security
and
that
of
two
other
officers
in
the
service
they
must
also
insure
their
lives
the
premium
and
the
interest
together
will
make
them
forfeit
fourteen
per
cent
per
annum
on
the
sum
advanced
the
loan
will
be
paid
off
in
three
years
by
monthly
instalments
the
paymaster
will
receive
an
order
from
the
bank
secretary
to
deduct
for
the
bank
so
much
per
mensem
from
their
pay
for
the
next
three
years
they
will
have
to
live
very
mildly
indeed
there
were
also
two
victims
both
youngsters
to
billiards
one
lost
three
thousand
rupees
in
bets
another
two
thousand
five
hundred
by
bad
play
they
too
will
have
to
fly
for
assistance
to
the
banks
captains
locke
and
bunyan
won
between
them
last
night
one
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
there
was
but
little
execution
done
at
whist
not
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
changed
hands
those
four
men
who
play
regularly
together
and
who
never
exceed
their
usual
bets
have
very
little
difference
between
them
at
the
end
of
each
month
not
thirty
pounds
either
way
this
will
not
hurt
them
for
they
have
all
good
appointments
and
have
private
property
besides
i
find
on
going
to
tiffin
at
jack
apsley
that
jack
has
heard
all
about
the
winnings
and
losings
at
the
club
some
man
went
home
and
told
his
wife
and
she
has
told
everybody
whom
she
has
seen
in
a
short
time
the
news
will
travel
to
at
simlah
and
out
will
come
a
general
order
on
gambling
which
general
order
will
be
read
aloud
at
the
himalaya
club
with
comments
by
the
whole
company
comments
which
will
be
received
with
shouts
of
laughter
some
youngsters
will
put
the
general
order
into
verse
and
send
it
to
a
newspaper
this
done
the
general
order
will
be
converted
into
this
is
no
doubt
very
sad
but
i
have
no
time
to
moralize
my
duty
is
simply
to
paint
the
picture
apsley
is
not
angry
with
her
husband
for
staying
up
till
daylight
she
thinks
a
little
dissipation
does
him
good
and
it
is
but
a
very
little
that
jack
indulges
in
for
he
is
a
good
husband
and
a
good
father
jack
has
a
severe
headache
but
he
wo
confess
it
he
says
he
never
touched
the
champagne
and
only
drank
two
glasses
of
brandy
and
water
but
who
ever
did
touch
the
champagne
and
who
ever
did
drink
any
more
than
two
glasses
of
brandy
and
water
jack
came
home
with
his
pockets
filled
with
almonds
raisins
prunes
nutcrackers
and
two
liqueur
glasses
but
how
they
got
there
he
has
not
the
slightest
idea
but
i
have
wywell
from
a
sideboard
was
filling
his
pockets
all
the
while
he
was
singing
rule
britannia
apsley
i
have
some
news
for
you
what
is
it
captain
wall
the
club
gives
a
ball
on
the
of
june
you
do
say
so
and
what
is
more
a
fancy
ball
the
tiffin
is
brought
in
mulligatawny
soup
and
rice
cold
lamb
and
mint
sauce
sherry
and
beer
the
apsleys
are
very
hospitable
people
but
mary
who
rules
the
household
never
exceeds
her
means
for
the
sake
of
making
a
display
the
soup
and
a
glass
of
wine
set
jack
up
and
he
becomes
quite
chirpy
he
proposes
that
he
and
i
and
wywell
shall
go
to
the
fancy
ball
as
middies
and
that
mary
shall
appear
as
susan
then
darting
off
at
a
tangent
he
asks
me
if
i
remember
when
we
were
lying
off
mount
edgecombe
just
before
sailing
for
south
america
but
he
requires
a
little
more
stimulant
for
the
tears
are
glistening
in
his
soft
blue
eyes
when
he
alludes
to
the
death
of
poor
noel
a
middy
whom
we
buried
in
the
ocean
a
few
days
before
we
got
to
rio
in
a
very
maudlin
way
he
narrates
to
his
wife
the
many
excellent
qualities
of
poor
noel
she
listens
with
great
attention
but
observing
that
his
spontaneous
emotion
is
the
result
of
the
two
glasses
of
brandy
plus
what
he
can
not
remember
drinking
she
suggests
that
jack
shall
make
some
sherry
cobbler
what
a
jewel
of
a
woman
art
thou
apsley
several
of
the
men
who
returned
home
as
jack
did
none
the
better
for
their
potations
have
been
driven
by
their
wives
reproaches
to
the
club
where
they
are
now
drinking
brandy
and
to
excess
while
here
is
your
spouse
as
comfortable
as
a
cricket
on
a
hearth
and
now
that
he
confesses
he
was
slightly
screwed
you
with
quiet
tact
contradict
his
assertion
for
the
next
week
the
forthcoming
fancy
ball
to
be
given
by
the
club
will
be
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
amongst
the
visitors
at
mussoorie
ludlam
is
in
immense
demand
she
knows
the
character
that
each
lady
will
appear
in
but
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
extract
from
her
the
slightest
particle
of
information
on
that
head
this
ball
will
be
worth
seven
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
to
ludlam
let
us
keep
away
from
the
club
for
a
few
days
for
after
several
officers
have
been
victimized
at
play
their
friends
are
apt
to
talk
about
the
matter
in
an
unpleasant
manner
this
frequently
leads
to
a
quarrel
which
i
dislike
to
witness
where
shall
we
go
to
the
dhoon
it
is
very
hot
there
but
never
mind
no
no
fires
an
hour
hence
but
the
very
lightest
of
garments
and
a
punkah
the
thermometer
is
at
degrees
there
the
dhoon
is
not
a
healthy
place
in
the
summer
it
must
have
been
the
bed
of
an
enormous
lake
or
small
inland
sea
its
soil
being
alluvial
will
produce
anything
every
kind
of
fruit
european
and
tropical
you
may
gather
a
peach
and
a
plantain
out
of
the
same
garden
some
of
the
hedges
in
this
part
of
the
world
are
singularly
beautiful
composed
of
white
and
red
cluster
roses
and
sweetbriers
there
is
an
excellent
hotel
in
the
dhoon
where
we
are
sure
to
meet
people
whom
we
know
sure
enough
i
find
a
party
of
five
at
the
hotel
all
club
men
and
intimate
friends
of
mine
they
too
have
come
down
to
avoid
being
present
on
the
first
settling
day
for
if
there
should
be
any
duelling
it
is
just
possible
that
some
of
us
might
be
asked
to
act
as
second
we
must
dine
off
in
the
dhoon
the
residents
at
mussoorie
used
to
form
their
in
the
dhoon
just
as
the
residents
of
london
form
their
whitebait
banquets
at
greenwich
i
once
took
a
french
gentleman
who
was
travelling
in
india
to
one
of
these
and
he
made
a
very
humorous
note
of
it
in
his
book
of
travel
which
he
showed
to
me
unlike
most
foreigners
who
travel
in
english
dominions
he
did
not
pick
out
and
note
down
all
the
bad
traits
in
our
character
but
gave
us
credit
for
all
those
excellent
points
which
his
experience
of
mankind
in
general
enabled
him
to
observe
the
is
quartered
just
now
in
the
dhoon
and
there
is
a
goorkha
regiment
here
the
dhoon
will
send
some
twenty
couples
to
the
fancy
ball
on
the
every
lady
in
the
place
has
at
this
moment
a
durzee
man
tailor
employed
in
her
back
verandah
we
are
admitted
to
the
confidence
of
plowville
who
is
going
as
norma
and
a
very
handsome
norma
she
will
make
she
being
rather
like
madame
grisi
and
she
knows
it
we
return
to
the
club
on
the
of
june
there
has
been
a
serious
dispute
and
a
duel
has
been
fought
but
happily
no
blood
shed
the
intelligence
of
the
gambling
at
the
club
has
reached
the
at
simlah
and
he
has
ordered
that
the
remainder
of
the
leave
granted
to
captains
locke
and
bunyan
be
cancelled
and
that
those
officers
forthwith
join
their
respective
regiments
the
victims
also
have
been
similarly
treated
yet
every
one
of
these
remanded
officers
came
up
here
on
medical
certificate
it
is
the
morning
of
the
of
june
the
stewards
of
the
ball
are
here
there
and
everywhere
making
arrangements
several
old
hands
who
hate
and
detest
balls
and
who
voted
against
this
ball
are
walking
about
the
public
room
protesting
that
it
is
the
greatest
folly
they
ever
heard
of
and
in
their
disgust
they
blackball
two
candidates
for
admission
who
are
to
be
balloted
for
on
the
instant
they
complain
that
they
can
get
no
tiffin
no
dinner
no
anything
but
the
stewards
only
laugh
at
them
the
supper
has
been
supplied
by
monsieur
emille
the
french
restaurateur
and
a
very
splendid
supper
it
is
it
is
laid
out
in
the
emille
is
a
great
artist
he
is
not
perhaps
equal
to
brazier
that
great
man
whom
louis
philippe
gave
to
his
friend
lord
william
bentinck
when
lord
william
was
going
out
to
govern
india
but
emille
nevertheless
would
rank
high
even
amongst
the
most
skilful
of
cuisiniers
in
europe
it
is
a
quarter
past
nine
and
we
of
the
club
are
ready
to
receive
our
guests
the
ladies
come
in
janpans
their
husbands
following
them
on
horseback
or
on
foot
it
is
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
we
are
always
obliged
to
wait
upon
the
moon
when
we
give
a
ball
in
mussoorie
before
ten
the
room
is
crowded
there
are
present
one
hundred
and
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
the
former
are
soldiers
the
remainder
are
civilians
of
the
latter
seventy
are
married
the
remaining
five
are
spinsters
here
we
all
are
in
every
variety
of
costume
turks
greeks
romans
bavarian
medoras
corsairs
hamlets
othellos
tells
charles
the
seconds
and
quakers
many
have
not
come
in
fancy
costume
but
in
their
respective
uniforms
and
where
do
you
see
such
a
variety
of
uniforms
as
in
an
indian
where
will
you
meet
with
so
great
a
number
of
distinguished
men
there
is
the
old
general
that
empty
sleeve
tells
a
tale
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
beside
him
is
a
general
in
the
company
service
one
who
has
recently
received
the
thanks
of
his
country
he
has
seen
seventy
but
there
is
no
man
in
the
room
who
could
at
this
very
time
endure
so
great
an
amount
of
mental
or
bodily
fatigue
that
youngster
to
the
right
of
the
general
is
to
be
made
a
and
a
as
soon
as
he
gets
his
company
he
is
a
hero
though
a
mere
boy
that
civilian
is
a
man
of
great
ability
and
possesses
administrative
talents
of
the
very
highest
order
seated
on
an
ottoman
talking
to
hastings
is
the
famous
hawkins
of
the
third
dragoons
laughing
in
the
side
doorway
is
the
renowned
william
mumble
he
is
the
of
a
dashing
soldier
yonder
is
major
starcross
whose
gallantry
in
affghanistan
was
the
theme
of
admiration
in
europe
and
there
is
colonel
bolt
of
the
duke
own
all
of
these
men
have
been
under
very
hot
fire
the
hottest
that
even
lord
hardinge
could
remember
all
of
them
are
decorated
with
medals
and
ribbons
where
will
you
see
handsomer
women
than
you
frequently
meet
in
a
at
mussoorie
or
simlah
amongst
those
now
assembled
there
are
three
who
at
any
court
in
europe
would
be
conspicuous
for
their
personal
attractions
merrydale
plowville
and
banks
apsley
is
a
pretty
little
woman
but
the
three
to
whom
i
have
alluded
are
beautiful
the
dancing
has
commenced
and
will
continue
until
four
with
an
interval
of
at
the
second
supper
the
ladies
being
gone
will
then
commence
and
a
very
noisy
party
it
will
be
unrestrained
by
the
presence
of
the
fair
sex
the
majority
of
those
who
remain
will
drink
and
smoke
in
earnest
and
the
chances
are
there
will
be
several
rows
ensign
jenks
when
the
brandy
and
water
inflames
him
will
ask
young
blackstone
of
the
civil
service
what
he
meant
by
coming
up
and
talking
to
his
partner
during
the
last
set
of
quadrilles
blackstone
will
say
the
lady
beckoned
to
him
jenks
will
say
it
is
a
lie
blackstone
will
rise
to
assault
jenks
two
men
will
hold
blackstone
down
on
his
chair
the
general
will
hear
of
this
for
captain
lovelass
who
is
himself
almost
inarticulate
has
said
to
jenks
cossider
self
unarrest
jenks
will
have
to
join
his
regiment
at
meerut
after
receiving
from
the
general
a
very
severe
reprimand
while
talking
over
the
past
ball
an
archery
meeting
or
a
is
sure
to
be
suggested
it
must
originate
at
the
club
without
the
countenance
of
the
club
which
is
very
jealous
of
its
prerogative
no
amusement
can
possibly
be
successful
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
civilian
who
prided
herself
on
her
husband
lofty
position
had
once
the
temerity
to
try
the
experiment
and
actually
sent
round
a
in
her
own
handwriting
and
by
one
of
her
own
servants
she
failed
of
course
all
the
club
people
wrote
the
word
seen
opposite
to
their
names
but
withheld
the
important
word
approved
even
the
tradespeople
at
mussoorie
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
the
himalaya
club
the
season
is
over
the
cold
weather
has
commenced
in
the
plains
it
is
the
of
october
and
everybody
at
mussoorie
is
on
the
move
going
down
the
hill
as
it
is
called
every
house
which
was
lately
full
is
now
empty
and
will
remain
so
till
the
coming
april
the
only
exceptions
will
be
the
schools
for
young
ladies
and
for
little
boys
the
convent
the
branch
of
the
bank
and
the
invalided
officers
who
reside
at
the
sanatarium
during
the
summer
will
go
down
the
hill
and
winter
in
deyrah
dhoon
in
another
month
the
mountains
will
be
covered
with
snow
and
it
would
be
dangerous
to
walk
out
on
these
narrow
roads
few
of
which
are
railed
in
let
us
sum
up
the
events
of
the
season
four
young
men
were
victimized
two
at
cards
and
two
at
billiards
two
duels
were
fought
on
the
day
after
the
ball
in
one
of
these
duels
an
officer
fell
dead
in
another
the
offending
party
grievously
wounded
his
antagonist
four
commissions
were
sacrificed
in
consequence
of
these
encounters
there
were
two
elopements
merrydale
went
off
with
lieutenant
maxwell
leaving
her
children
under
the
care
of
the
servants
until
her
husband
came
to
take
them
away
hastings
who
used
to
bore
us
about
the
duties
of
a
wife
carried
off
that
silly
boy
stammersleigh
these
elopements
led
to
two
actions
in
supreme
court
of
calcutta
and
seven
of
us
four
in
one
case
and
three
in
the
other
had
to
leave
our
regiments
or
appointments
and
repair
to
the
supreme
court
to
give
evidence
some
of
us
had
to
travel
fourteen
hundred
miles
in
the
month
of
may
the
hottest
month
in
india
there
was
another
very
awkward
circumstance
connected
with
that
season
at
mussoorie
the
reader
knows
that
captains
locke
and
bunyan
were
ordered
to
join
their
regiments
the
unexpired
portion
of
their
leave
having
been
cancelled
by
order
of
his
excellency
the
in
the
hurry
of
his
departure
from
the
hills
locke
had
left
in
the
drawer
of
a
table
a
letter
from
bunyan
containing
a
proposal
to
victimize
a
certain
officer
then
in
mussoorie
in
the
same
manner
that
they
had
victimized
one
lord
george
straw
namely
to
get
him
to
their
rooms
and
play
at
brag
lord
george
straw
had
lost
to
these
worthies
eighteen
hundred
pounds
on
one
eventful
night
the
general
opinion
was
touching
a
very
extraordinary
fact
connected
with
the
play
that
lord
george
had
been
cheated
this
letter
from
bunyan
to
locke
was
found
by
the
servant
of
the
officer
who
now
occupied
the
apartments
recently
vacated
by
locke
the
servant
handed
it
to
his
master
who
fancying
that
it
was
one
of
his
own
letters
began
abstractedly
to
read
it
very
soon
however
he
discovered
his
mistake
but
he
had
read
sufficient
to
warrant
his
reading
the
whole
and
he
did
so
a
meeting
of
gentlemen
at
the
club
was
called
and
before
long
locke
and
bunyan
left
the
army
by
sentence
of
a
general
i
have
since
heard
that
locke
lost
his
gains
in
ireland
and
became
eventually
a
marker
at
a
and
that
bunyan
who
also
came
to
poverty
was
seen
driving
a
cab
for
hire
in
it
behoves
me
however
to
inform
the
reader
that
recently
the
tone
of
society
during
the
hot
seasons
is
very
much
improved
six
or
seven
years
ago
there
never
was
a
season
that
did
not
end
as
unhappily
as
that
which
i
have
attempted
to
describe
but
it
is
now
four
years
since
i
heard
of
a
duel
in
the
upper
provinces
upwards
of
four
years
since
i
heard
of
a
victim
to
gambling
and
nearly
three
since
there
was
an
elopement
it
is
true
that
the
records
of
still
occasionally
exhibit
painful
cases
but
if
we
compare
the
past
with
the
present
we
must
admit
that
the
change
is
very
satisfactory
i
do
not
attribute
this
altered
state
of
things
to
the
vigilance
of
commanding
officers
or
the
determination
of
the
to
punish
severely
those
who
offend
it
is
due
chiefly
to
the
improved
tone
of
society
in
england
from
which
country
we
get
our
habits
and
manners
the
improvement
in
the
tone
of
indian
society
has
been
very
gradual
twenty
years
ago
india
was
famous
for
its
infamy
ten
years
ago
it
was
very
bad
it
is
now
tolerable
in
ten
years
from
this
date
if
not
in
less
time
indian
society
will
be
purged
entirely
of
those
evils
which
now
prey
upon
it
and
trials
for
drunkenness
and
other
improper
conduct
will
happen
as
rarely
as
in
england
year
by
year
this
communication
between
our
fatherland
and
the
upper
part
of
india
will
become
more
speedy
and
less
expensive
and
thus
will
a
greater
number
of
officers
be
enabled
to
come
home
on
furlough
for
a
year
or
two
nothing
does
an
indian
officer
so
much
good
as
a
visit
to
europe
when
a
man
has
once
contracted
bad
habits
in
india
he
can
not
reform
in
india
to
be
cured
he
must
be
taken
away
for
a
while
from
the
country
there
have
been
instances
of
officers
who
have
had
strength
of
mind
to
alter
their
course
of
life
without
leaving
the
east
but
those
instances
are
very
few
the
east
india
company
should
do
all
in
its
power
to
encourage
young
officers
to
spend
a
certain
time
every
seven
years
in
europe
instead
of
six
months
leave
to
the
hills
which
six
months
are
spent
in
utter
idleness
and
too
frequently
in
dissipation
give
them
nine
leave
to
europe
this
would
admit
of
their
spending
six
months
in
england
or
on
the
continent
where
they
would
improve
their
minds
and
mend
their
morals
as
well
as
their
constitutions
the
east
india
company
should
also
bring
the
peninsular
and
oriental
company
to
reasonable
terms
for
the
passage
of
officers
to
and
from
india
a
lieutenant
who
wishes
to
come
home
can
not
at
present
get
a
passage
from
calcutta
to
southampton
under
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
so
that
he
gives
up
more
than
four
months
pay
for
being
kept
days
on
board
of
a
steamer
three
pounds
ten
shillings
per
diem
for
food
and
transit
the
mahommedan
mother
mussoorie
and
landour
situated
in
the
lower
range
of
the
himalaya
mountains
form
the
favourite
sanitarium
of
the
upper
part
of
india
the
scenery
is
more
beautiful
than
that
of
simlah
for
mussoorie
and
landour
command
a
view
of
dehra
dhoon
which
resembles
except
that
the
dhoon
is
grander
and
more
extensive
the
plains
of
italy
as
seen
from
the
ascent
of
the
simplon
the
mall
of
mussoorie
is
crowded
every
evening
with
visitors
some
on
horseback
some
on
hill
ponies
some
on
foot
and
some
in
the
janpan
something
like
a
carried
by
four
hill
men
a
gayer
scene
it
would
be
impossible
to
conceive
every
one
knows
his
neighbour
and
in
passing
along
the
narrow
road
stoppages
are
frequent
compliments
must
be
exchanged
and
the
news
or
scandal
of
the
day
gossiped
about
every
now
and
then
you
hear
a
cry
of
what
a
shame
from
a
terrified
lady
in
a
janpan
while
a
couple
of
lovers
gallop
past
on
spirited
arabs
at
full
speed
sometimes
a
shriek
from
a
nervous
mamma
reverberates
through
the
valleys
when
she
beholds
her
children
in
the
way
of
the
heedless
pair
accidents
sometimes
occur
a
few
years
ago
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
were
riding
round
a
place
called
the
camel
back
the
road
gave
way
and
they
fell
down
a
precipice
several
hundred
feet
the
horses
were
killed
but
the
riders
miraculously
escaped
with
only
a
few
severe
bruises
on
another
occasion
a
gentleman
of
the
civil
service
was
taking
his
evening
walk
when
one
of
his
dogs
ran
between
his
legs
and
precipitated
him
he
was
killed
on
the
spot
on
the
mall
every
evening
was
to
be
seen
a
native
woman
standing
by
the
side
of
the
road
near
a
large
rock
watching
those
who
passed
by
she
was
well
dressed
and
her
face
was
concealed
according
to
the
custom
of
persons
of
her
apparent
station
in
life
there
she
stood
attracting
general
attention
she
was
a
woman
of
slight
but
graceful
figure
and
rather
tall
many
persons
were
curious
to
know
who
she
was
and
to
see
her
face
but
she
took
care
that
in
this
respect
none
should
be
gratified
sometimes
she
would
go
away
early
at
other
times
she
would
remain
until
it
was
quite
dark
some
suspected
and
i
was
amongst
the
number
that
she
was
the
native
wife
of
some
european
officer
who
had
divorced
himself
and
visited
the
hills
whither
the
woman
to
annoy
had
followed
him
and
there
was
no
small
amount
of
speculation
as
to
whose
wife
she
could
be
some
of
the
guesses
if
they
were
seriously
made
were
extremely
ungenerous
for
they
included
several
elderly
officials
who
could
not
by
any
possibility
have
been
married
to
this
mysterious
lady
i
was
determined
to
know
who
she
was
and
one
night
when
most
people
were
thronged
around
the
band
i
approached
her
and
inquired
if
i
could
be
of
any
service
to
her
she
replied
her
face
closely
covered
yes
by
going
away
she
had
a
very
sweet
voice
and
its
sorrowful
tones
inspired
me
with
pity
when
she
added
i
am
a
poor
woman
my
heart
is
crushed
do
not
add
to
my
misery
by
remaining
near
me
i
obeyed
her
after
apologizing
for
having
intruded
several
other
persons
had
attempted
to
extract
some
particulars
from
the
lady
and
had
received
the
same
sort
of
reply
as
that
she
had
given
to
me
the
rains
were
about
to
commence
and
storms
were
not
unfrequent
the
mall
was
less
frequented
only
a
few
those
who
cared
little
about
hearing
heaven
artillery
thunder
in
the
skies
or
being
pelted
by
hailstones
as
large
as
marbles
ventured
out
but
amongst
that
few
was
the
native
lady
who
punctual
as
the
light
of
day
visited
that
huge
rock
and
gazed
upon
the
road
i
have
seen
a
storm
on
the
heights
of
jura
such
a
storm
as
lord
byron
describes
i
have
seen
lightning
and
heard
thunder
in
australia
i
have
off
terra
del
fuego
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
the
coast
of
java
kept
watch
in
thunderstorms
which
have
drowned
in
their
roaring
the
human
voice
and
made
every
one
deaf
and
stupified
but
these
storms
are
not
to
be
compared
with
a
thunderstorm
at
mussoorie
or
landour
in
one
of
these
storms
of
thunder
lightning
wind
and
hail
at
about
five
in
the
afternoon
i
laid
a
wager
with
a
friend
that
the
native
lady
would
be
found
as
usual
standing
near
the
rock
something
secretly
assured
me
that
she
was
there
at
that
moment
looking
on
unmoved
except
by
the
passions
which
had
prompted
her
pilgrimage
how
were
we
to
decide
it
by
going
to
the
spot
i
suggested
my
friend
declined
but
declared
that
as
far
as
the
bet
was
concerned
he
would
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
my
word
either
one
way
or
the
other
namely
whether
i
had
won
or
lost
i
set
off
upon
my
journey
the
rock
was
at
least
of
a
mile
distant
from
my
abode
my
curiosity
was
so
much
aroused
albeit
i
felt
certain
the
woman
was
there
that
i
walked
through
the
storm
without
heeding
it
every
now
and
then
i
saw
the
electric
fluid
descend
into
a
valley
then
heard
that
strange
noise
which
huge
pieces
of
rock
make
when
they
bound
from
one
precipice
to
another
tearing
up
trees
and
carrying
large
stones
and
the
earth
along
with
them
in
their
headlong
career
but
still
my
mind
was
intent
on
the
woman
and
nothing
else
was
she
there
yes
there
she
sat
drenched
to
the
skin
but
i
could
not
pity
her
wet
and
cold
condition
for
i
could
see
that
she
cared
no
more
about
it
than
i
cared
about
my
own
she
drew
her
garment
so
closely
over
her
face
that
the
outline
of
her
features
was
plainly
discernible
it
was
decidedly
handsome
but
still
i
longed
to
see
her
eyes
to
confirm
my
impression
i
sat
beside
her
the
storm
still
raged
and
presently
the
lady
said
the
heaven
is
speaking
sahib
i
answered
truly
but
the
lightning
the
parent
of
that
sound
which
i
now
hear
i
can
not
see
she
understood
me
and
gave
me
a
glimpse
of
her
eyes
they
were
not
like
the
eyes
of
a
native
they
were
of
a
bluish
hue
almost
grey
i
said
to
her
in
hindoostanee
you
are
not
a
native
what
do
you
do
here
in
a
native
dress
i
would
i
were
an
european
she
answered
me
my
feelings
perhaps
would
be
less
acute
and
i
should
be
sitting
over
a
bright
fire
oh
how
loudly
the
heaven
is
speaking
go
home
sahib
you
will
catch
cold
why
do
not
go
home
i
asked
you
will
see
no
one
no
not
even
your
beloved
i
am
the
only
being
who
will
venture
out
in
a
storm
like
this
and
i
do
so
only
for
your
sake
my
heart
is
as
hard
as
this
rock
she
said
flipping
her
finger
against
the
granite
to
all
except
one
being
a
child
oh
how
the
heaven
is
speaking
sahib
do
you
not
fear
the
lightning
and
the
hail
i
asked
her
i
did
once
she
replied
i
trembled
whenever
it
came
near
but
now
what
does
it
signify
lightning
come
to
me
she
cried
beckoning
to
a
streak
of
fluid
which
entered
the
ground
within
a
hundred
yards
of
us
come
here
and
make
a
turquoise
of
my
heart
what
pretty
feet
she
had
kicked
off
her
shoes
which
were
saturated
and
spoiled
go
home
sahib
such
was
the
refrain
of
her
conversation
you
will
catch
cold
by
degrees
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
all
her
features
she
was
most
beautiful
but
had
evidently
passed
the
meridian
of
her
charms
she
could
not
have
been
less
than
years
of
age
on
the
forefinger
of
her
left
hand
she
wore
a
ring
of
english
manufacture
in
which
was
set
a
red
cornelian
whereon
was
engraved
a
crest
a
head
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
and
said
where
did
you
get
this
pointing
to
the
ring
she
smiled
and
sighed
and
then
answered
jee
sir
it
belonged
to
an
ameer
a
great
man
where
is
he
never
mind
do
you
expect
to
see
him
soon
no
never
is
he
old
no
not
older
than
yourself
how
the
heaven
is
speaking
let
me
see
you
to
your
home
no
i
will
go
alone
when
do
you
intend
to
go
when
you
have
left
me
you
are
very
unkind
thus
to
repulse
my
civility
it
may
be
so
but
my
heart
blood
is
curdled
i
bade
her
farewell
and
through
the
storm
which
still
raged
i
went
home
and
won
my
wager
i
could
not
rest
that
night
the
beautiful
face
of
the
native
woman
haunted
me
in
vain
i
tried
to
sleep
and
at
last
i
arose
from
my
bed
and
joined
a
in
the
hope
that
the
excitement
of
gambling
would
banish
her
from
my
brain
but
to
no
purpose
i
knew
not
what
i
was
playing
and
ere
long
i
left
off
in
disgust
almost
every
one
who
visits
the
hills
keeps
a
servant
called
a
his
duty
is
to
look
after
the
men
who
carry
your
janpan
to
go
errands
to
keep
up
the
fire
and
to
accompany
you
with
a
lantern
when
you
go
out
after
dark
these
tindals
like
the
couriers
on
the
continent
are
a
peculiar
race
and
generally
speaking
are
a
very
sharp
active
and
courageous
people
i
summoned
my
tindal
and
interrogated
him
about
the
native
lady
who
had
caused
so
much
sensation
in
mussoorie
the
only
information
he
could
afford
me
was
that
she
had
come
from
a
village
near
hurdwar
that
she
was
rich
possessed
of
the
most
costly
jewels
kept
a
number
of
servants
moved
about
in
great
state
on
the
plains
and
for
all
he
knew
she
might
be
the
wife
or
slave
of
some
rajah
could
she
i
wondered
be
the
famous
ranee
chunda
the
mother
of
dulleep
singh
and
the
wife
of
runjeet
the
woman
who
disguised
as
a
soldier
had
escaped
from
the
fort
of
chunar
where
she
had
been
imprisoned
for
disturbing
by
her
plots
the
imagination
of
sir
frederick
currie
when
he
was
resident
at
lahore
the
woman
i
had
seen
and
spoken
to
answered
to
the
description
of
the
ranee
in
every
respect
excepting
the
eyes
dulleep
singh
was
living
at
mussoorie
and
he
not
unfrequently
rode
upon
the
mall
ranee
chunda
had
a
satirical
tongue
and
a
peculiarly
but
shrill
voice
and
she
had
remarkably
beautiful
feet
and
so
had
this
woman
ranee
chunda
had
courage
which
was
superhuman
so
had
this
woman
ranee
chunda
had
a
child
an
only
child
so
had
this
woman
i
asked
the
tindal
where
the
lady
lived
he
replied
that
she
occupied
a
small
house
near
the
bazaar
not
very
far
from
my
own
abode
she
is
in
great
grief
the
tindal
yawned
about
something
or
other
endeavour
to
find
out
the
cause
of
her
misfortunes
said
i
and
you
shall
be
rewarded
according
to
your
success
next
day
the
tindal
reported
to
me
that
i
was
not
the
only
sahib
who
was
deeply
interested
in
the
native
lady
affairs
that
many
wished
to
make
her
acquaintance
and
had
sent
their
tindals
to
talk
to
her
but
that
she
had
firmly
and
laconically
dismissed
them
all
just
as
she
had
dismissed
him
tell
your
master
that
the
sufferings
of
an
object
of
pity
such
as
i
am
ought
not
to
be
aggravated
by
the
insulting
persecution
of
gay
and
men
the
day
after
the
storm
brought
forth
the
loveliest
afternoon
that
can
be
imagined
the
sun
shone
out
brightly
the
clouds
were
lifted
from
the
dhoon
and
the
vast
panorama
resembled
what
we
read
of
in
some
fairy
tale
all
mussoorie
and
landour
turned
out
the
mall
was
so
crowded
that
it
was
difficult
to
thread
one
way
through
the
throng
was
the
lady
at
the
rock
yes
there
she
stood
as
usual
watching
those
who
passed
the
maharajah
with
his
suite
appeared
i
was
convinced
that
the
woman
was
the
maharajah
mother
but
i
did
not
breathe
my
suspicions
lest
i
might
cause
her
to
be
arrested
when
it
became
dusk
and
the
visitors
were
taking
their
departure
i
again
approached
the
lady
and
made
my
salaam
in
that
respectful
phrase
which
is
always
adopted
when
addressing
a
native
woman
of
rank
she
at
once
recognised
me
as
the
person
who
had
spoken
to
her
during
the
storm
on
the
previous
afternoon
for
she
alluded
to
its
fury
and
said
she
had
taken
a
wrong
road
had
lost
her
way
after
i
had
left
her
and
did
not
reach
home
till
nearly
midnight
she
concluded
her
little
speech
with
a
hope
that
i
had
been
more
fortunate
you
should
have
allowed
me
to
escort
you
said
i
i
would
have
helped
to
carry
your
load
of
sorrow
she
looked
at
me
and
suddenly
and
abruptly
said
your
name
is
longford
you
are
right
said
i
about
three
or
four
years
ago
you
stayed
for
several
days
with
a
friend
in
a
tent
near
deobund
you
were
on
your
way
to
these
mountains
i
did
you
had
a
little
dog
with
you
and
you
lost
it
at
deobund
i
did
lose
my
dog
and
made
a
great
noise
about
it
but
how
do
you
know
all
this
she
smiled
and
sighed
i
was
bewildered
my
belief
that
she
was
the
ranee
chunda
was
almost
confirmed
it
was
close
to
the
encampment
of
the
ranee
when
she
was
on
her
way
to
chunar
that
my
dog
was
lost
and
my
servants
and
the
officers
of
police
declared
that
it
must
have
been
some
of
the
people
who
had
stolen
the
favourite
the
dog
is
still
alive
said
the
lady
and
if
you
will
come
at
twelve
to
my
house
you
shall
see
him
but
you
will
promise
not
to
take
him
from
me
of
course
i
will
not
take
him
from
you
but
let
me
see
him
and
tell
me
how
he
came
into
your
possession
i
will
see
you
to
your
home
no
sahib
be
patient
i
will
tell
you
all
and
when
you
have
heard
my
story
you
will
perhaps
do
me
a
kindness
it
is
in
your
power
to
assist
me
tell
me
where
you
live
and
i
will
send
my
brother
to
you
at
eleven
he
will
conduct
you
to
my
house
salaam
sahib
i
returned
her
salaam
and
left
her
i
did
not
go
to
bed
till
two
the
next
morning
and
when
my
tindal
aroused
me
at
eleven
and
informed
me
that
a
young
man
wished
to
see
me
i
was
disposed
to
believe
that
my
engagement
at
twelve
had
been
made
in
my
dreams
i
ordered
the
young
man
to
be
admitted
he
came
to
my
bedside
and
said
in
a
confidential
tone
of
voice
the
lady
has
sent
me
to
wait
your
commands
i
got
up
made
a
hasty
toilet
drank
a
cup
of
very
hot
tea
and
followed
the
young
man
who
led
me
to
the
little
house
near
the
theatre
at
the
top
of
the
bazaar
i
entered
the
abode
and
found
the
lady
sitting
native
fashion
on
a
carpet
on
which
was
strewed
marigold
and
rose
leaves
her
silver
kulean
small
hookah
was
beside
her
and
sure
enough
there
was
my
terrier
duke
looking
as
sleek
fat
lazy
and
useless
as
a
native
lady
dog
could
be
after
expressing
my
thanks
to
the
lady
for
her
condescension
in
granting
me
the
interview
i
spoke
to
my
former
favourite
duke
but
he
only
stretched
himself
and
yawned
in
reply
and
you
have
still
that
ring
with
the
blue
stone
in
it
said
the
lady
taking
my
hand
and
smiling
while
she
looked
at
the
ring
i
remember
observing
this
when
i
saw
you
asleep
one
morning
on
a
couch
in
the
tent
at
deobund
had
i
noticed
it
when
you
addressed
me
during
the
storm
i
would
not
have
spoken
so
rudely
to
you
i
do
not
remember
having
seen
you
previous
to
the
other
evening
said
i
and
if
i
had
i
should
never
have
forgotten
it
where
have
we
met
i
repeated
where
i
had
opportunities
of
seeing
you
but
where
you
could
not
see
me
there
was
an
old
serving
woman
whom
she
called
mother
attending
upon
her
and
the
young
man
whom
she
called
brother
a
looking
youth
was
still
standing
in
the
room
to
which
he
had
conducted
me
the
lady
desired
them
both
to
withdraw
and
then
begged
me
to
bring
the
mora
or
stool
upon
which
i
was
sitting
close
to
her
side
i
obeyed
her
she
placed
her
head
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
and
gave
vent
to
a
violent
flood
of
tears
i
suffered
her
to
weep
without
interruption
grief
appeared
to
relieve
her
rather
than
to
increase
her
pain
at
length
she
dried
her
eyes
and
said
my
father
was
a
mahommedan
law
officer
attached
to
the
sudder
court
in
agra
i
am
his
only
daughter
he
was
absent
from
home
all
day
why
should
he
not
be
he
was
paid
for
it
he
ate
the
salt
well
when
i
was
about
fifteen
years
of
age
i
was
enticed
away
from
my
home
by
the
native
police
officer
he
sent
an
old
woman
who
had
silver
on
her
tongue
and
gold
in
her
hand
she
told
me
long
stories
about
love
and
promised
me
that
if
i
left
my
home
i
should
marry
the
son
who
was
young
and
handsome
i
was
but
a
child
and
very
foolish
the
servants
who
had
charge
of
me
were
all
bribed
heavily
one
received
three
hundred
rupees
another
two
hundred
a
third
one
hundred
these
people
encouraged
me
in
the
idea
that
to
marry
the
son
would
be
the
most
prudent
thing
in
the
world
and
one
day
when
my
father
had
gone
to
the
court
at
about
ten
i
eloped
with
the
old
woman
whom
the
had
sent
to
talk
me
over
we
travelled
all
day
in
a
native
carriage
guarded
by
two
sowars
i
asked
the
old
woman
several
times
where
she
was
taking
me
but
her
only
reply
was
your
heart
at
rest
child
and
eat
some
sweetmeats
the
which
she
gave
me
must
have
been
drugged
for
shortly
after
eating
it
i
fell
asleep
how
long
i
slept
i
can
not
say
but
when
i
awoke
i
found
myself
in
the
house
of
a
sahib
the
old
woman
was
there
also
i
became
alarmed
but
my
fears
were
quieted
by
the
old
woman
tongue
she
told
me
i
was
close
to
agra
but
the
truth
was
i
was
one
hundred
koss
two
hundred
miles
distant
nautch
girls
were
sent
for
and
they
danced
before
me
i
had
this
hookah
given
to
me
and
these
bangles
a
boy
very
handsomely
dressed
waited
upon
me
and
brought
my
food
parrots
minahs
and
doves
were
purchased
for
me
to
play
with
whatever
my
childish
fancy
dictated
the
old
woman
instantly
procured
i
was
so
constantly
amused
i
had
no
time
or
inclination
to
think
of
my
home
my
father
was
a
man
and
i
was
only
too
glad
to
be
out
of
hearing
of
the
quarrels
in
which
he
constantly
engaged
with
his
servants
and
dependents
one
evening
the
old
woman
said
to
me
child
order
a
nautch
this
evening
and
let
me
in
your
name
invite
the
sahib
to
witness
it
i
had
never
seen
an
englishman
an
european
except
at
a
distance
the
idea
of
being
in
the
room
with
one
inspired
me
with
terror
i
had
been
taught
to
despise
the
kafir
whom
my
father
said
he
was
compelled
to
serve
i
objected
but
the
old
woman
eloquence
again
prevailed
the
night
came
i
was
seated
on
my
carpet
just
as
i
am
now
and
dressed
in
clothes
of
the
gayest
description
i
was
like
a
little
queen
and
felt
as
proud
as
was
noor
jehan
i
was
then
very
handsome
if
i
had
not
been
much
trouble
would
have
been
spared
and
my
flesh
was
firm
not
as
it
is
now
at
about
ten
the
sahib
made
his
appearance
when
he
came
into
the
room
i
was
ready
to
faint
with
alarm
and
turning
my
head
away
i
clung
to
the
old
woman
and
trembled
from
head
to
foot
do
not
fear
said
the
sahib
and
then
he
reproved
but
in
a
gentle
voice
the
nautch
girls
who
were
laughing
loudly
at
me
the
old
woman
too
bade
me
banish
my
fears
after
a
while
i
ventured
to
steal
a
look
at
the
sahib
and
again
averted
my
face
and
clung
to
the
old
woman
the
sahib
after
remaining
a
brief
while
during
which
he
praised
my
beauty
retired
and
i
was
once
more
happy
said
the
old
woman
when
he
was
gone
see
the
sahib
is
not
a
wild
beast
out
of
the
jungles
but
as
gentle
as
one
of
your
own
doves
on
the
following
day
i
heard
the
sahib
talking
in
the
next
room
i
peeped
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
and
saw
him
seated
at
a
table
the
head
clerk
was
standing
beside
him
reading
there
was
a
man
in
chains
surrounded
by
guards
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
a
woman
was
there
giving
her
evidence
the
was
undergoing
some
repairs
and
the
sahib
was
carrying
on
his
magisterial
duties
in
his
the
man
in
chains
began
to
speak
and
deny
his
guilt
the
sahib
called
out
silence
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
i
involuntarily
started
back
and
shuddered
the
prisoner
again
addressed
the
sahib
and
one
of
the
dealt
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
head
accompanied
by
the
words
chor
pig
thief
the
case
was
deferred
until
the
following
day
and
the
court
closed
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sahib
again
paid
me
a
visit
i
was
now
afraid
to
show
my
fears
lest
the
sahib
should
order
me
to
be
killed
and
i
therefore
put
on
a
cheerful
countenance
while
my
heart
was
quivering
in
my
breast
the
sahib
spoke
to
me
very
kindly
and
i
began
to
dread
him
less
in
this
way
i
spent
a
fortnight
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
ventured
to
talk
to
the
sahib
as
though
i
were
his
equal
it
afforded
me
great
amusement
to
watch
the
administration
of
justice
through
the
keyhole
and
young
as
i
was
i
imbibed
a
desire
to
have
a
share
in
the
arbitrary
power
which
was
daily
exercised
one
day
when
the
sahib
came
into
my
room
i
began
to
talk
to
him
about
a
case
of
which
he
had
just
disposed
he
laughed
and
listened
to
my
views
with
great
patience
i
told
him
that
the
evidence
upon
which
the
prisoner
had
been
convicted
was
false
from
beginning
to
end
he
promised
me
that
he
would
reverse
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
and
in
the
ecstasy
of
my
joy
at
finding
that
i
really
had
some
power
i
was
intoxicated
and
unconscious
of
what
i
was
doing
i
suffered
the
lips
to
touch
mine
no
sooner
had
i
done
so
than
i
felt
a
degraded
outcast
and
i
cried
more
bitterly
than
i
have
words
to
describe
the
sahib
consoled
me
and
said
that
his
god
and
his
prophet
should
be
mine
and
that
in
this
world
and
the
next
our
destinies
should
be
the
same
from
that
day
i
was
a
wife
unto
him
i
ruled
his
household
and
i
shared
his
pleasures
and
his
sorrows
he
was
in
debt
but
by
reducing
his
expenses
i
soon
freed
him
for
his
pay
was
fifteen
hundred
rupees
a
month
i
suffered
no
one
to
rob
him
and
caused
the
old
woman
who
was
a
great
thief
and
cheat
to
be
turned
away
i
loved
him
with
all
my
soul
i
would
rather
have
begged
with
him
than
have
shared
the
throne
of
ackbar
shah
when
he
was
tired
i
lulled
him
to
sleep
when
he
was
ill
i
nursed
him
when
he
was
angry
i
soon
restored
him
to
and
when
i
saw
him
about
to
be
deceived
by
subordinates
i
put
him
on
his
guard
that
he
loved
me
i
never
had
any
reason
to
doubt
he
gave
me
his
confidence
and
i
never
abused
his
trust
who
was
the
man
i
inquired
for
i
was
in
doubt
although
i
suspected
be
patient
sahib
she
replied
and
then
resumed
at
the
end
of
two
years
i
became
a
mother
here
she
gave
vent
to
another
flood
of
tears
the
sahib
was
pleased
the
child
seemed
to
bind
us
more
closely
together
i
loved
the
child
i
believe
it
was
because
it
bore
such
a
strong
likeness
to
its
father
when
the
sahib
was
away
from
me
on
duty
in
the
district
he
seemed
still
by
my
side
when
i
looked
at
the
boy
who
was
as
white
as
you
are
is
the
child
dead
i
asked
be
patient
sahib
when
you
passed
through
deobund
and
stayed
in
the
tent
with
your
friend
my
child
was
two
years
old
i
was
the
mistress
of
that
encampment
at
deobund
and
the
wine
you
drank
was
given
out
with
this
hand
how
little
do
men
know
of
each
other
i
exclaimed
even
those
who
are
the
most
intimate
i
had
not
the
least
idea
there
was
a
lady
in
the
camp
i
assure
you
how
angry
with
you
was
i
said
she
for
keeping
the
sahib
up
so
late
you
talked
together
the
whole
night
long
therefore
i
had
no
remorse
when
i
took
your
dog
well
as
you
are
aware
soon
after
that
the
sahib
was
seized
with
fever
from
which
he
recovered
but
he
was
so
shattered
by
the
attack
that
he
was
compelled
to
visit
europe
where
you
know
she
paused
a
native
woman
will
never
if
she
can
avoid
it
speak
of
the
death
of
a
person
whom
she
has
loved
i
was
aware
of
this
and
bowed
my
head
touching
my
forehead
with
both
hands
the
father
of
her
child
had
died
on
his
passage
to
england
before
he
left
me
she
continued
he
gave
me
all
that
he
possessed
his
house
and
furniture
his
horses
carriage
plate
his
shares
in
the
bank
his
watch
his
his
rings
everything
was
given
to
me
and
i
own
all
to
this
hour
when
i
heard
the
sad
news
i
was
heartbroken
had
it
not
been
for
the
child
i
would
have
starved
myself
to
death
as
it
was
i
took
to
opium
and
smoking
hemp
while
i
was
in
this
state
my
sahib
brother
the
captain
sahib
came
and
took
away
the
boy
not
by
violence
i
gave
it
to
him
what
was
the
child
to
me
then
i
did
not
care
but
the
old
woman
whom
you
heard
me
call
my
mother
who
now
attends
me
gradually
weaned
me
from
the
desperation
in
which
i
was
indulging
and
by
degrees
my
senses
returned
to
me
i
then
began
to
ask
about
my
child
and
a
longing
to
see
him
came
over
me
at
first
they
told
me
he
was
dead
but
when
they
found
i
was
resolved
to
destroy
myself
by
intemperance
they
told
me
the
truth
that
the
child
was
living
and
at
school
in
these
hills
i
have
come
hither
to
be
near
my
child
i
see
him
almost
every
day
but
it
is
at
a
distance
sometimes
he
passes
close
to
where
i
stand
and
i
long
to
spring
upon
him
and
to
hug
him
to
my
breast
whereon
in
infancy
his
head
reposed
i
pray
that
i
could
speak
to
him
give
him
a
kiss
and
bless
him
but
he
is
never
alone
he
is
always
playing
with
or
talking
to
the
other
little
boys
at
the
same
school
it
seems
hard
that
he
should
be
so
joyous
while
his
own
mother
is
so
wretched
of
what
use
to
me
is
the
property
i
have
when
i
can
not
touch
or
be
recognised
by
my
own
flesh
and
blood
you
know
the
master
of
the
school
yes
could
you
not
ask
him
to
allow
my
child
to
visit
you
i
could
then
see
him
once
more
and
speak
to
him
you
were
a
friend
of
his
father
and
the
request
would
not
seem
strange
i
felt
myself
placed
in
a
very
awkward
position
and
would
make
no
promise
but
i
told
the
woman
i
would
consider
the
matter
and
let
her
know
on
the
following
day
provided
she
would
stay
at
home
and
not
visit
that
rock
upon
the
road
any
more
she
strove
hard
to
extract
from
me
a
pledge
that
i
would
yield
to
her
request
but
difficult
as
it
was
to
deny
her
anything
she
was
still
so
beautiful
and
so
interesting
i
would
not
commit
myself
and
held
to
what
i
had
in
the
first
instance
stated
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
school
at
which
my
friend
child
had
been
placed
by
his
uncle
a
captain
in
the
east
india
company
service
i
saw
some
thirty
scholars
of
all
colours
on
the
but
i
soon
recognised
the
boy
whom
i
was
so
curious
to
see
he
was
indeed
very
like
his
father
not
only
in
face
and
figure
but
in
manner
gait
and
bearing
i
called
to
the
little
fellow
and
he
came
and
took
my
hand
with
a
frankness
which
charmed
me
the
schoolmaster
told
me
that
the
boy
was
very
clever
and
that
although
only
six
years
old
there
were
but
few
of
his
playmates
whom
he
did
not
excel
his
father
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
said
indeed
our
acquaintance
began
when
we
were
not
older
than
this
child
would
you
have
any
objection
to
allow
the
boy
to
spend
a
day
with
me
i
promised
his
uncle
was
the
schoolmaster
reply
that
he
should
not
go
out
and
that
i
would
watch
him
closely
but
of
course
he
will
be
quite
safe
with
you
any
day
that
you
please
to
send
for
him
he
shall
be
ready
does
he
know
anything
of
his
mother
i
inquired
nothing
said
the
schoolmaster
he
was
very
young
when
he
came
to
me
i
have
no
idea
who
or
what
or
where
the
mother
is
for
his
uncle
did
not
enter
into
the
particulars
of
his
parentage
the
mother
must
have
been
very
fair
if
she
were
a
native
the
boy
is
so
very
slightly
touched
with
the
i
went
home
and
sent
for
the
mother
she
came
and
i
entreated
her
to
forego
her
request
for
the
child
sake
i
represented
to
her
that
it
might
unsettle
him
and
cause
him
to
be
discontented
i
assured
her
that
he
was
now
as
happy
and
as
well
taken
care
of
as
any
mother
could
desire
her
offspring
to
be
on
hearing
this
the
poor
woman
became
frantic
she
knelt
at
my
feet
and
supplicated
me
to
listen
to
her
entreaty
a
sight
of
her
child
a
few
words
with
him
and
a
kiss
from
his
lips
she
said
she
did
not
wish
him
to
know
that
she
was
his
mother
that
if
i
would
have
him
brought
into
my
house
she
would
dress
in
the
garb
of
a
servant
woman
or
groom
wife
and
talk
to
the
boy
without
his
being
aware
that
she
was
the
person
who
had
brought
him
into
the
world
and
you
will
not
play
me
false
said
i
moved
by
her
tears
you
will
not
when
you
have
once
got
hold
of
the
boy
decline
to
relinquish
that
hold
and
defy
his
friends
as
mothers
done
to
take
him
from
you
except
by
an
order
of
court
remember
dooneea
that
was
her
name
that
i
am
running
a
great
risk
and
am
moreover
deceiving
the
schoolmaster
and
behaving
badly
to
the
boy
uncle
by
allowing
myself
to
be
swayed
by
your
tears
and
my
own
feelings
consider
what
disgrace
you
will
bring
upon
me
if
you
fail
to
keep
your
word
in
this
matter
she
bound
herself
by
an
oath
that
she
would
do
all
i
required
if
i
would
only
give
her
the
interview
at
twelve
said
i
you
may
come
here
at
that
hour
in
this
room
the
child
shall
be
with
me
come
in
the
dress
of
a
poor
woman
and
bring
an
infant
with
you
let
your
excuse
be
that
you
have
come
to
complain
of
the
you
have
received
from
your
husband
who
is
in
my
service
this
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
bidding
you
remain
until
justice
be
done
and
meanwhile
you
will
see
the
boy
and
when
i
go
out
of
the
room
which
will
be
only
for
a
short
time
you
can
talk
to
him
do
you
know
your
part
dooneea
yes
sahib
at
twelve
salaam
dooneea
salaam
sahib
she
went
away
with
a
cheerful
countenance
there
are
no
such
actors
in
the
world
as
the
people
of
hindostan
the
boy
came
to
me
a
little
before
twelve
and
was
reading
to
me
when
dooneea
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
dressed
in
the
shabbiest
apparel
rushed
into
the
room
and
commenced
an
harangue
she
said
she
had
been
beaten
unmercifully
by
her
husband
for
no
cause
whatever
that
he
had
broken
one
of
her
fingers
and
had
attempted
to
stab
her
but
she
had
saved
her
life
by
flight
all
this
she
accompanied
with
gesticulations
and
tears
according
to
the
custom
of
complainants
in
the
east
i
feigned
to
be
very
angry
with
the
husband
and
hastily
left
the
room
as
if
to
make
inquiry
and
to
send
for
him
i
ran
round
to
an
outer
door
and
peeped
in
upon
dooneea
and
her
boy
she
was
repeating
the
same
tale
to
the
child
and
the
child
was
imploring
her
not
to
cry
it
was
a
strange
scene
the
tears
she
was
now
shedding
were
not
mock
tears
the
boy
asked
her
how
her
husband
came
to
beat
her
she
began
thus
i
was
sitting
near
the
fire
talking
to
my
eldest
boy
and
had
my
arm
round
his
waist
there
just
as
i
put
my
arm
round
your
waist
and
i
said
to
the
boy
is
getting
very
late
and
you
must
go
to
sleep
and
i
pulled
him
to
my
breast
like
this
and
gave
him
a
kiss
on
his
forehead
then
on
his
eyes
there
just
as
gently
as
that
yes
just
like
that
well
the
boy
began
to
cry
why
did
he
cry
because
you
told
him
to
go
to
bed
yes
said
dooneea
but
his
father
came
in
and
thought
i
was
teasing
the
child
he
abused
me
and
then
he
beat
me
the
woman
gazed
at
her
child
and
having
a
good
excuse
for
weeping
in
her
alleged
wrongs
she
did
not
scruple
to
avail
herself
of
it
from
behind
the
screen
which
concealed
me
from
her
sight
and
that
of
the
boy
i
too
shed
tears
of
pity
i
returned
to
the
room
and
said
dooneea
since
you
are
afraid
of
your
life
do
not
leave
this
house
until
i
tell
you
to
do
so
but
give
your
infant
to
the
sweeper
wife
to
take
care
of
i
do
not
like
your
children
in
my
house
how
thankful
she
was
she
placed
her
head
upon
my
feet
and
cracked
her
knuckles
over
my
knees
charles
lamb
says
that
the
children
of
the
poor
are
adults
from
infancy
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
children
of
the
rich
in
india
dooneea
little
boy
discussed
the
conduct
of
the
cruel
husband
and
sympathised
with
the
wife
as
though
he
had
been
called
upon
to
adjudicate
the
affair
in
a
court
of
justice
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
what
a
wicked
man
to
beat
such
a
dear
looking
woman
and
he
gave
dooneea
the
rupee
which
i
had
given
to
him
on
the
day
previous
when
i
saw
him
at
the
school
with
what
delight
did
dooneea
tie
up
that
piece
of
coin
from
the
child
hand
in
the
corner
of
her
garment
it
seemed
far
more
precious
to
her
than
all
the
jewels
which
his
dead
father
had
presented
to
her
in
days
gone
by
it
was
a
gift
from
her
own
child
who
was
living
but
to
her
dead
dooneea
spoke
persian
a
language
the
boy
did
not
understand
his
father
had
taught
dooneea
that
language
in
order
that
their
servants
might
not
know
the
tenor
of
their
discourse
in
that
language
dooneea
now
spoke
to
me
in
the
presence
is
he
not
very
like
his
father
she
said
very
i
replied
will
he
be
as
clever
he
is
too
young
for
any
one
to
judge
of
that
but
he
will
be
as
generous
she
pointed
to
the
coin
and
he
will
be
as
tall
as
as
passionate
as
gentle
and
as
kind
the
boy
boots
were
muddy
dooneea
observed
this
and
with
her
own
little
hands
cleaned
them
and
smiling
she
asked
him
for
a
present
in
that
tone
and
manner
which
the
poorest
menial
in
hindostan
adopts
when
addressing
the
most
haughty
superior
the
boy
blushed
and
looked
at
me
have
you
nothing
to
give
her
said
i
nothing
said
he
i
gave
her
my
rupee
give
her
that
pretty
blue
ribbon
which
is
round
your
neck
and
i
will
give
you
one
like
it
said
i
he
took
the
ribbon
from
his
neck
and
gave
it
to
dooneea
dooneea
twisted
the
ribbon
in
her
hair
and
began
to
weep
afresh
do
not
cry
you
silly
woman
said
i
i
will
see
that
your
husband
does
not
beat
you
again
she
understood
me
and
dried
her
tears
dooneea
again
spoke
to
me
in
persian
sahib
said
she
they
do
not
wash
the
children
properly
at
that
school
order
me
to
do
this
charley
why
did
you
come
to
me
in
this
state
with
your
neck
unwashed
i
asked
the
boy
we
only
wash
in
warm
water
once
a
week
on
saturdays
he
replied
this
is
thursday
but
i
can
not
allow
you
to
dine
with
me
in
this
state
said
i
in
hindostanee
you
must
be
well
washed
my
boy
dooneea
give
the
child
a
bath
with
reluctant
steps
the
child
followed
his
mother
to
my
i
peeped
through
the
purdah
for
i
began
to
fear
that
i
should
have
some
trouble
in
parting
the
mother
from
her
child
and
half
repented
that
i
had
ever
brought
them
together
while
dooneea
was
brushing
the
child
hair
she
said
mama
kahan
hai
where
is
your
mother
the
boy
answered
i
do
not
know
i
began
to
cough
to
inform
dooneea
that
i
was
within
hearing
and
that
i
objected
to
that
strain
of
examination
she
ceased
immediately
i
had
an
engagement
to
ride
with
a
lady
on
the
mall
my
horse
was
brought
to
the
door
but
i
was
afraid
to
leave
dooneea
alone
with
the
boy
notwithstanding
her
solemn
promise
that
she
would
not
run
off
with
him
yet
i
did
not
like
to
hurry
that
eternal
separation
on
earth
which
for
the
boy
sake
i
was
determined
their
separation
should
be
i
walked
up
and
down
my
verandah
for
some
time
meditating
how
i
could
part
them
at
last
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
send
the
boy
away
to
his
school
by
stratagem
and
trust
to
chance
how
i
might
best
explain
to
dooneea
that
he
would
not
return
i
ordered
a
groom
to
saddle
a
little
pony
that
i
possessed
and
told
dooneea
that
i
wished
the
boy
to
take
a
ride
with
me
and
that
while
we
were
absent
she
ought
to
take
some
food
it
stung
me
to
the
soul
to
witness
how
innocent
she
was
of
my
intentions
for
she
seemed
pleased
that
i
should
show
her
child
so
much
attention
as
to
be
seen
in
public
with
him
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
sight
of
my
house
i
took
the
road
for
landour
delivered
the
boy
over
to
his
schoolmaster
told
my
groom
to
keep
the
pony
out
till
after
dark
cantered
to
the
mall
kept
my
engagement
and
returned
to
my
home
at
about
seven
there
was
dooneea
waiting
for
us
in
the
verandah
where
is
the
boy
she
inquired
on
finding
me
return
alone
i
gave
her
no
reply
but
dismounted
and
approached
her
taking
hold
of
her
wrists
i
said
in
the
gentlest
voice
dooneea
i
have
fulfilled
my
promise
you
have
seen
your
child
you
have
spoken
to
him
you
have
kissed
him
enough
he
has
now
gone
back
to
school
you
must
not
see
him
again
if
you
really
love
him
she
trembled
in
my
grasp
looked
piteously
in
my
face
gasped
several
times
for
breath
as
though
she
longed
to
speak
and
swooned
at
my
feet
i
lifted
her
carried
her
into
the
house
and
laid
her
upon
my
bed
then
sent
for
servants
and
for
a
doctor
who
lived
near
my
bungalow
the
doctor
came
while
he
felt
her
pulse
and
placed
his
hand
over
her
heart
i
briefly
explained
to
him
what
had
taken
place
he
still
kept
his
finger
on
the
vein
and
gazed
on
dooneea
beautiful
face
blood
began
to
trickle
from
her
nostrils
and
from
her
ears
staining
the
bed
linen
and
the
squalid
garments
in
which
she
had
attired
herself
in
a
few
minutes
the
doctor
released
his
hold
of
her
wrist
poor
thing
he
ejaculated
her
troubles
are
over
she
is
at
rest
never
more
on
her
shall
sorrow
light
or
shame
she
was
dead
the
old
woman
whom
dooneea
called
mother
and
the
looking
youth
whom
she
called
brother
decamped
with
her
jewels
and
moveables
including
my
dog
duke
but
the
house
near
hurdwar
and
the
bank
shares
property
to
the
value
of
about
four
thousand
pounds
remain
invested
in
the
names
of
trustees
for
the
benefit
of
the
boy
who
will
i
trust
make
good
use
of
his
little
fortune
when
he
becomes
of
age
black
and
blue
forty
years
ago
there
went
out
to
india
in
the
good
ship
ensign
the
honourable
francis
gay
a
younger
son
of
the
right
honourable
the
earl
of
millflower
the
ensign
was
in
his
nineteenth
year
and
was
proceeding
to
join
his
regiment
which
was
stationed
at
chinsurah
lord
millflower
in
his
heart
hoped
that
his
son
would
never
return
he
was
so
great
a
disgrace
to
his
family
there
was
no
vice
with
which
this
youth
was
unfamiliar
he
had
been
expelled
from
no
fewer
than
seven
schools
in
two
instances
his
offence
was
theft
his
conduct
had
so
preyed
upon
the
mind
of
lady
millflower
that
she
lost
her
reason
at
seventeen
he
committed
several
forgeries
of
his
eldest
brother
lord
larkspeare
name
and
he
took
a
similar
liberty
with
the
name
of
his
father
steward
but
these
offences
were
hushed
up
he
was
also
guilty
of
a
deed
of
violence
for
which
his
life
would
have
been
forfeited
had
the
case
been
tried
instead
of
compromised
for
in
those
days
such
a
deed
of
violence
was
a
capital
offence
his
family
were
in
constant
fear
lest
he
should
be
transported
as
a
felon
or
hanged
at
newgate
it
was
therefore
some
satisfaction
to
them
when
the
honourable
francis
consented
to
hold
a
commission
and
join
his
regiment
in
india
lord
millflower
other
sons
four
in
number
were
all
steady
and
rather
dull
beings
while
francis
was
remarkably
gifted
as
well
as
remarkably
vicious
he
had
both
talent
and
genius
humour
and
wit
and
much
as
he
had
neglected
his
education
he
was
well
read
and
well
informed
for
his
time
of
life
in
personal
appearance
also
the
reprobate
had
the
advantage
over
his
brethren
none
of
them
were
even
except
francis
who
was
really
very
handsome
well
proportioned
and
tall
his
manners
also
always
frank
were
when
he
pleased
dignified
and
courteous
and
his
bearing
peculiarly
graceful
what
he
wanted
was
feeling
to
regulate
his
passions
of
feeling
he
was
in
his
youth
wholly
destitute
lord
millflower
had
taken
the
precaution
of
writing
to
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
his
son
was
about
to
join
and
of
at
the
same
time
enclosing
a
sum
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
freeing
francis
from
any
pecuniary
difficulty
colonel
role
himself
had
the
misfortune
to
have
a
very
bad
boy
and
he
therefore
sympathized
deeply
with
the
worthy
nobleman
and
resolved
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
reform
the
honourable
francis
after
a
passage
of
four
months
the
arrived
at
calcutta
and
the
honourable
francis
gay
proceeded
to
chinsurah
and
joined
for
several
weeks
he
conducted
himself
with
for
him
wonderful
propriety
it
is
true
that
he
drank
and
played
at
billiards
and
cards
and
sometimes
an
oath
would
escape
his
lips
but
he
indulged
in
no
excesses
the
officers
of
the
regiment
indeed
thought
the
ensign
a
great
acquisition
for
he
was
not
only
a
very
pleasant
but
an
entertaining
companion
but
by
degrees
the
honourable
francis
fell
off
and
ere
long
so
far
from
having
a
friend
in
the
regiment
there
was
no
one
who
would
speak
to
him
even
the
colonel
was
compelled
to
forbid
him
his
house
many
very
many
acts
unbecoming
the
character
of
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
had
been
looked
over
by
his
seniors
but
it
was
resolved
that
on
the
very
next
occasion
of
his
transgressing
the
honourable
ensign
should
be
brought
to
a
and
dismissed
the
service
this
resolve
was
communicated
to
the
ensign
by
the
colonel
who
had
become
tired
of
lecturing
him
the
next
time
you
are
intoxicated
on
the
parade
ground
or
the
next
time
you
use
bad
language
in
the
or
the
next
time
you
publicly
insult
a
brother
officer
provoking
him
to
quarrel
with
you
you
will
forfeit
your
commission
being
the
son
of
an
earl
he
was
entitled
many
colonels
think
to
every
possible
chance
of
redemption
had
he
been
the
son
of
a
commoner
he
would
most
probably
have
been
and
cashiered
for
the
very
first
offence
thank
you
sir
replied
the
ensign
with
a
low
bow
i
will
be
more
cautious
in
future
he
kept
his
word
from
this
time
he
did
his
duty
extremely
well
and
to
all
outward
appearance
was
a
reformed
character
the
officers
observing
this
generously
made
advances
with
a
view
to
resuming
their
former
relations
with
him
but
the
honourable
francis
repulsed
their
advances
the
whole
regiment
had
thought
proper
to
cut
him
and
he
now
thought
proper
to
cut
the
whole
regiment
several
months
passed
and
during
that
period
the
ensign
applied
himself
to
hindostanee
and
persian
he
encouraged
the
natives
to
come
to
his
bungalow
to
talk
with
him
and
by
night
and
by
day
pursued
his
studies
the
result
was
that
he
soon
conversed
with
perfect
ease
and
accuracy
he
now
began
to
live
like
a
native
a
mahommedan
and
except
when
he
had
to
attend
to
his
regimental
duties
he
wore
the
native
costume
and
abstained
from
drink
entirely
with
truth
he
might
have
said
with
conrad
the
grape
gay
juice
my
bosom
never
cheers
i
more
than
moslem
when
the
cup
appears
his
food
was
rice
milk
vegetables
and
fruit
the
bed
upon
which
he
slept
was
hard
and
mean
such
as
the
natives
use
the
whole
of
his
european
furniture
he
sold
by
auction
his
desire
the
desire
of
a
doubtfully
reformed
reprobate
to
convert
to
christianity
a
young
mahommedan
girl
astonished
all
those
who
became
acquainted
with
this
desire
the
girl
was
the
daughter
of
a
bheestie
she
was
not
like
the
natives
of
india
but
more
like
those
of
africa
she
was
coal
black
and
had
thick
lips
and
wavy
hair
she
was
short
for
her
age
fourteen
years
but
thickset
with
powerful
limbs
the
girl
father
told
the
servants
belonging
to
other
officers
of
the
regiment
and
the
curious
whim
of
gay
became
a
topic
of
conversation
jehan
the
bheestie
daughter
was
a
virtuous
girl
and
francis
gay
had
never
approached
her
with
a
view
to
undermining
her
virtue
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
persuade
her
to
change
her
religion
but
strange
to
say
he
at
length
succeeded
and
noor
jehan
was
baptized
as
ellen
by
a
missionary
who
journeyed
to
chinsurah
for
the
purpose
of
performing
the
ceremony
the
sanity
or
otherwise
of
the
ensign
was
now
very
generally
discussed
in
the
regiment
and
the
prevalent
opinion
was
that
he
was
a
lunatic
but
the
good
colonel
was
a
little
angry
at
the
surmise
surely
he
said
you
do
not
accuse
a
man
of
being
a
maniac
because
he
has
converted
an
infidel
the
regiment
was
ordered
to
march
to
cawnpore
whither
ellen
and
her
father
also
proceeded
cawnpore
was
then
the
chief
station
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
five
thousand
troops
were
quartered
there
a
regiment
of
dragoons
a
regiment
of
native
cavalry
a
regiment
of
british
infantry
and
two
of
native
infantry
besides
horse
and
foot
there
were
companies
of
artillery
and
sappers
and
miners
very
shortly
after
the
regiment
was
settled
in
cawnpore
the
honourable
francis
gay
paid
a
visit
to
the
chaplain
and
intimated
a
desire
to
be
married
the
chaplain
of
course
replied
that
he
should
be
most
happy
and
there
and
then
a
day
and
hour
was
appointed
for
the
performance
of
the
rite
but
when
the
reverend
gentleman
came
to
hear
who
was
to
be
the
honourable
ensign
bride
the
black
daughter
of
a
native
he
could
not
help
remarking
i
am
sorry
mr
gay
that
i
can
not
with
sincerity
offer
you
my
congratulations
to
which
the
ensign
responded
my
good
sir
i
did
not
ask
them
and
retired
with
a
bow
the
chaplain
drove
to
the
house
of
colonel
role
and
told
him
of
the
interview
which
had
just
taken
place
between
himself
and
ensign
the
honourable
francis
gay
the
colonel
called
upon
the
young
man
and
entreated
him
to
reflect
i
reflected
sir
was
the
reply
the
colonel
then
went
to
the
general
and
the
general
sent
for
mr
gay
to
attend
at
his
bungalow
mr
gay
obeyed
the
summons
and
listened
with
attention
and
much
calmness
to
a
long
and
violent
speech
when
it
was
ended
however
mr
gay
with
extreme
courtesy
and
in
the
quietest
of
tones
spoke
thus
general
you
had
a
right
to
command
my
attendance
here
upon
any
military
matter
but
not
upon
any
civil
matter
however
i
waive
that
because
i
believe
your
intention
to
be
a
good
one
you
general
have
arrived
at
the
years
of
discretion
perhaps
at
something
beyond
those
years
you
have
at
all
events
arrived
at
a
time
of
life
when
the
tumultuous
passion
of
youth
can
no
longer
be
pleaded
in
extenuation
of
certain
follies
now
tell
me
general
which
of
us
think
you
sins
the
most
and
sets
the
worst
example
to
the
men
european
and
native
in
this
station
i
who
wish
to
marry
this
good
christian
girl
or
you
who
have
in
your
house
mr
gay
then
made
mention
of
two
very
discreditable
members
of
the
general
establishment
this
is
a
question
which
i
shall
put
to
the
if
you
abide
by
your
threat
to
report
me
to
his
excellency
that
night
the
general
and
colonel
role
held
a
consultation
the
colonel
still
doubted
the
ensign
insanity
it
had
become
a
fixed
idea
in
the
regiment
that
gay
was
insane
the
general
caught
at
this
and
a
committee
of
doctors
was
appointed
to
examine
the
ensign
they
reported
that
ensign
the
honourable
francis
gay
was
not
only
of
sound
mind
but
one
of
the
most
intellectual
young
men
in
the
station
and
that
he
had
explained
to
their
entire
satisfaction
certain
conversations
which
he
had
frequently
held
with
himself
in
chinsurah
at
the
the
had
been
put
off
in
consequence
of
these
proceedings
but
the
parties
now
met
in
the
church
which
was
crowded
with
officers
including
nearly
the
entire
medical
staff
who
were
curious
to
witness
the
spectacle
there
stood
the
tall
and
handsome
english
aristocrat
and
beside
him
his
bride
dressed
in
garments
of
red
silk
trimmed
with
yellow
and
gold
tinsel
the
ensign
acted
as
the
interpreter
and
explained
to
ellen
in
hindoostanee
the
vows
she
was
required
to
take
this
made
the
ceremony
a
very
long
one
when
it
was
concluded
the
bride
got
into
her
palanquin
and
was
carried
home
the
bridegroom
mounted
his
pony
and
rode
by
her
side
ellen
now
the
honourable
mrs
gay
was
a
girl
of
great
natural
ability
of
an
excellent
disposition
and
was
blessed
with
an
excellent
temper
she
had
moreover
a
very
sweet
voice
after
her
marriage
she
was
never
seen
by
any
european
in
cawnpore
except
her
husband
it
was
believed
that
the
ensign
saved
more
than
of
his
pay
which
ellen
who
had
an
excellent
idea
of
business
used
to
lend
out
in
small
sums
to
people
in
the
bazaar
at
the
rate
of
fifty
per
cent
per
mensem
if
she
lent

shillings
she
would
get
back
at
the
end
of
the

and
eight

three
shillings

way
of
interest
a
year
passed
away
and
a
son
and
heir
was
born
to
the
honourable
francis
gay
the
child
had
light
blue
eyes
exactly
like
those
of
his
father
but
his
complexion
was
quite
as
black
as
his
mother
when
the
child
was
three
months
old
it
was
brought
to
the
church
and
publicly
christened

long
after

ensign
gay
obtained
his
promotion
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
and
received
of
course
an
increase
of
pay
fever
became
prevalent
and
cholera
several
of
the
captains
and
senior
lieutenants
fell
victims
and
in
less
than
three
years
lieutenant

got
his
company
the
regiment
was
now
at
meerut
and
retired
from
the
army
by
the
sale
of
his
captain
commission
it
was
supposed
that
he
was
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
a
lac
of
rupees
ten
thousand
pounds
at
the
very
least
whither
he
went
no
one
knew
and
no
one
cared
one
of
the
servants
whom
he
discharged
previous
to
leaving
the
station
of
meerut
said
he
believed
that
his
master
had
gone
either
to
affghanistan
or
to
lahore
let
us
now
return
to
europe
a
few
years
after
captain
gay
had
sold
out
of
the
army
his
eldest
brother
lord
larkspeare
was
killed
while
by
the
accidental
discharge
of
his
gun
his
second
brother
augustus
a
captain
in
the
army
was
lost
in
a
vessel
which
was
bringing
him
home
from
canada
his
third
brother
george
died
of
three
days
after
he
had
taken
his
father
second
title
of
his
son
francis
marriage
lord
millflower
had
been
informed
and
also
of
the
birth
of
the
black
child
the
honourable
ernest
augustus
george
francis
frederick
gay
colonel
role
had
deemed
it
his
duty
not
to
withhold
these
facts
albeit
they
were
disagreeable
to
communicate
to
the
noble
earl
lord
millflower
begged
of
colonel
role
to
institute
an
inquiry
into
the
fate
of
his
francis
and
the
colonel
did
so
but
without
success
no
clue
to
his
whereabout
could
be
discovered
nor
could
any
one
say
what
had
become
of
him
under
these
circumstances
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
he
was
dead
another
five
years
passed
away
and
the
earl
of
millflower
departed
this
life
he
was
of
course
succeeded
in
his
titles
and
estates
by
his
son
frederick
now
let
us
return
to
francis
he
became
a
dealer
in
precious
stones
and
travelled
over
the
whole
of
india
under
the
name
of
mustapha
khan
visiting
the
various
native
courts
every
tour
that
he
made
occupied
him
three
years
constantly
moving
about
in
the
sun
had
tanned
his
once
fair
face
and
neither
from
his
appearance
for
he
was
dressed
as
a
native
nor
from
his
speech
could
the
natives
themselves
detect
that
he
was
an
european
he
gave
out
that
his
birthplace
was
nepaul
where
the
natives
are
sometimes
born
with
blue
eyes
he
bought
and
sold
and
was
apparently
very
happy
in
his
occupation
his
wife
and
son
invariably
accompanied
him
in
his
travels
he
had
never
written
to
his
family
since
his
arrival
in
india
and
had
not
received
letters
from
any
member
thereof
india
he
loved
england
he
detested
and
would
not
have
taken
up
his
father
title
if
it
had
been
a
dukedom
he
never
approached
the
abode
of
an
european
and
never
saw
a
newspaper
he
was
not
likely
therefore
to
hear
of
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
at
home
in
the
bazaar
at
delhi
captain
gay
had
a
small
house
in
which
were
deposited
his
effects
a
few
boxes
filled
with
clothes
books
his
sword
and
the
uniform
he
used
formerly
to
wear
these
were
under
the
care
of
a
a
sweeper
the
bulk
of
his
worldly
wealth
he
invariably
carried
about
his
person
as
many
natives
of
india
do
ernest
gay
was
now
twelve
years
of
age
he
was
usually
called
by
his
parents
chandee
a
word
signifying
silver
chandee
was
clever
and
cunning
and
had
a
wonderful
talent
for
calculating
numbers
in
less
than
a
minute
by
counting
on
his
fingers
he
would
tell
you
the
interest
due
on
such
sums
as
three
rupees
five
annas
and
seven
pic
for
days
at
per
cent
english
he
had
never
heard
spoken
and
as
he
had
never
been
taught
that
language
he
did
not
understand
a
single
word
of
it
nor
could
he
read
or
write
hindoostanee
although
he
spoke
it
in
all
its
purity
and
elegance
there
was
about
to
take
place
a
marriage
in
the
family
of
the
rajah
of
pulbecala
mustapha
khan
francis
gay
journeyed
from
delhi
to
the
rajah
court
to
exhibit
his
jewels
he
had
diamonds
rubies
and
emeralds
of
great
price
and
some
of
these
he
hoped
to
dispose
of
to
advantage
the
rajah
however
had
already
provided
himself
with
these
matters
and
therefore
confined
his
purchases
to
a
large
ring
for
which
he
paid
mustapha
fifty
gold
mohurs
eighty
pounds
on
his
way
back
to
delhi
at
a
place
called
kunda
ka
serai
a
band
of
robbers
attacked
the
they
hacked
him
to
pieces
with
their
swords
but
they
spared
his
wife
and
the
boy
the
whole
of
their
treasures
were
stolen
even
the
rings
from
ellen
ears
and
fingers
and
the
gold
bangles
which
chandee
wore
upon
his
arms
when
her
senses
were
restored
to
her
ellen
with
the
assistance
of
her
son
dug
a
grave
in
the
sand
and
buried
her
butchered
husband
the
bearers
who
carried
the
palanquins
ran
away
as
soon
as
the
robbers
attacked
the
party
and
were
no
more
seen
most
probably
they
had
some
small
share
of
the
booty
the
value
of
which
the
sirdar
estimated
at
four
lacs
of
rupees
forty
thousand
pounds
whatever
had
been
francis
gay
vices
when
a
youth
and
they
were
great
enough
in
all
conscience
he
had
been
a
kind
and
affectionate
husband
to
ellen
and
she
most
bitterly
deplored
his
loss
violent
was
the
grief
of
chandee
who
was
devotedly
fond
of
his
father
they
heaped
stones
over
the
grave
of
the
dead
man
to
mark
the
spot
where
he
was
laid
and
after
their
own
fashion
offered
up
prayers
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
the
murder
having
been
committed
within
the
dominions
of
an
independent
prince
ellen
knew
that
her
wrongs
were
not
likely
to
be
redressed
if
she
complained
and
that
the
british
government
would
not
interfere
unless
she
made
known
that
her
husband
was
an
englishman
this
she
felt
would
be
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
dead
hopeless
and
helpless
she
and
her
son
made
the
best
of
their
way
to
delhi
where
having
collected
a
few
debts
that
were
due
to
them
they
established
a
small
shop
for
the
sale
of
native
sweetmeats
they
carried
on
this
business
for
three
or
four
years
when
chandee
grew
weary
of
it
and
set
up
in
the
world
as
a
or
pedler
his
box
contained
pens
ink
and
paper
needles
pins
knives
scissors
soap
eau
de
cologne
matches
and
so
forth
his
customers
were
the
european
officers
who
gave
him
the
name
of
black
and
blue
from
the
colour
of
his
eyes
and
skin
a
is
always
a
great
cheat
as
great
a
rascal
as
was
autolycus
himself
black
and
blue
if
the
truth
must
be
told
was
not
an
exception
to
the
rule
or
race
but
no
one
could
grudge
him
his
profits
when
the
cuffs
and
kicks
which
were
playfully
administered
to
him
by
the
young
lieutenants
and
ensigns
are
taken
into
consideration
black
and
blue
always
took
the
rough
usage
of
his
customers
in
excellent
part
and
would
generally
make
some
such
appeal
as
this
he
had
picked
up
a
little
english
by
this
time
ah
well
i
know
you
rich
white
gentlemans
i
poor
black
devil
i
pray

then
god

and
mother
and
brother
and
sister
and
then
for
all
that
pray
i
get
so
much
kick
and
so
many
bad
words
god
make
us
all
black
and
white
all
equal

very
good

genuine
only
one
rupee

not
got
ready
money
very
well
i
wait
till
come
i
very
poor
man
you
my
master
khuda
lord
kuren
the
meaning
of
this
expression
with
which
most
natives
wind
up
a
speech
to
an
european
signifies
may
god
make
you
a
lord
when
black
and
blue
was
no
more
than
five
years
old
he
was
playing
one
morning
in
his
father
compound
enclosure
the
land
around
the
bungalow
when
a
pariah
dog
rushed
in
and
mangled
him
very
severely
the
dog
was
rabid
captain
gay
called
in
the
doctor
of
a
native
cavalry
regiment
who
lived
in
the
next
bungalow
who
cauterized
the
wounds
the
child
was
bitten
on
the
arms
legs
and
chest
and
was
under
the
doctor
treatment
for
upwards
of
five
weeks
on
several
occasions
when
he
visited
his
patient
the
doctor
saw
and
conversed
with
ellen
who
was
naturally
very
anxious
touching
the
child
safety
this
doctor
was
one
of
the
number
who
witnessed
the
marriage
of
ensign
gay
at
cawnpore
and
was
also
present
when
his
offspring
was
christened
shortly
after
the
recovery
of
the
little
boy
the
doctor
had
been
appointed
a
presidency
surgeon
and
had
charge
of
one
of
the
hospitals
in
calcutta
where
he
remained
for
upwards
of
twenty
years
he
was
then
appointed
superintending
surgeon
of
the
meerut
division
he
had
a
son
at
delhi
a
lieutenant
in
the
foot
artillery
and
occasionally
went
over
the
distance
is
only
forty
miles
from
meerut
to
pay
him
a
visit
on
one
of
these
occasions
black
and
blue
who
had
been
sent
for
made
his
appearance
with
his
box
sat
down
on
the
carpet
and
opened
out
his
treasures
there
were
several
young
officers
in
the
bungalow
chums
of
the
lieutenant
and
while
the
bargaining
was
going
on
they
began
to
tease
black
and
blue
one
removed
his
turban
with
the
point
of
a
stick
another
sprinkled
him
with
his
eau
de
cologne
a
third
touched
the
tip
of
his
great
toe
he
had
left
his
shoes
out
of
respect
in
the
verandah
with
the
lighted
end
of
a
cheroot
black
and
blue
howled
with
pain
whereupon
the
two
roared
with
laughter
the
doctor
who
was
reading
a
paper
begged
the
young
men
to
desist
and
somewhat
angrily
expostulated
with
his
son
for
treating
a
native
so
cruelly
for
he
was
touched
with
poor
black
and
blue
appeal
god
make
us
all
when
fire
burns
black
man
black
man
feels
as
much
pain
as
white
man
in
hell
you
rich
gentlemans
sing
out
just
as
much
as
poor
black
and
blue
is
used
to
it
governor
said
the
lieutenant
stuff
robert
said
the
doctor
i
address
myself
to
you
and
not
to
these
gentlemen
when
i
say
that
i
have
no
patience
with
such
flippant
cruelty
sahib
said
black
and
blue
looking
up
at
the
doctor
you
are
very
good
gentlemans
very
kind
man
and
very
handsome
may
god
make
you
a
lord
may
your
throne
be
perpetual
and
may
your
end
be
peace
but
do
not
be
angry
with
these
gentlemen
they
play
tricks
with
black
and
blue
but
they
are
no
enemies
if
enemies
what
for
send
to
buy
black
and
blue
property
sir
you
greatly
oblige
black
and
blue
if
you
smile
once
more
on
these
gentlemans
sir
do
you
want
any
violent
violet
powder
or
one
small
patent
corkiscrew
corkscrew
all
men
born
equal
god

wet
black

and
white

all
the
same

he
laughed
at
the
lieutenant
take
one
packet
of
every
one
rupee
a
packet
well
then
take
two
for
one
twelve
that
ca
hurt
anybody
less
than
prime
cost
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
handsome
sir
do
be
angry
the
doctor
his
attention
attracted
by
those
light
blue
eyes
set
in
that
very
black
skin
stared
at
black
and
blue
for
several
minutes
after
he
had
finished
the
speech
above
quoted
he
had
never
before
seen
such
a
peculiar
expression
as
that
on
the
face
of
the
suddenly
he
recollected
an
instance
of
black
skin
and
light
blue
eyes
but
in
that
case
the
boy
was
the
child
of
the
honourable
francis
gay
black
and
blue
had
occasion
to
change
his
position
and
in
doing
so
exposed
the
calves
of
his
legs
on
one
of
them
was
a
scar
quite
round
and
about
the
size
of
a
shilling
good
god
exclaimed
the
doctor
who
became
both
surprised
and
agitated
and
allowed
the
newspaper
to
fall
from
his
hand
what
is
the
matter
governor
asked
the
lieutenant
nothing
nothing
said
the
doctor
still
staring
at
black
and
blue
whose
countenance
was
no
longer
strange
to
him
how
did
you
come
by
that
mark
he
at
length
asked
pointing
to
the
scar
i
do
know
sahib
but
did
not
your
parents
ever
tell
you
no
sahib
parents
used
to
say
that
it
come
of
itself
this
was
no
doubt
true
have
you
another
mark
like
that
on
your
right
arm
just
here
the
doctor
placed
his
finger
on
the
sleeve
of
the
man
dress
yes
but
bigger
mark
that
one
how
you
know
that
sahib
he
pulled
up
his
sleeve
and
exhibited
a
scar
the
size
of
and
another
here
on
your
hip
and
another
here
on
your
ribs
yes
all
them
marks
got
sir
how
you
know
that
sahib
the
doctor
was
quite
satisfied
that
black
and
blue
was
no
other
than
his
little
patient
of
former
years
and
consequently
the
heir
to
the
earldom
of
millflower
could
it
be
possible
he
thought
that
captain
gay
eventually
abandoned
his
black
wife
and
child
if
not
how
came
it
that
the
boy
now
a
man
of
two
or
three
and
twenty
should
be
a
miserable
pedler
living
in
the
bazaar
at
delhi
when
black
and
blue
had
sold
all
that
the
young
officers
wanted
to
buy
when
no
amount
of
coaxing
and
flattering
would
induce
them
to
take
anything
more
he
was
about
to
take
his
departure
but
the
doctor
desired
him
to
stay
and
intimated
to
his
son
that
he
wished
to
have
some
conversation
in
private
with
black
and
blue
where
is
your
father
the
doctor
asked
he
dead
sahib
when
did
he
die
long
time
ago
ten
or
twelve
year
ago
where
did
he
die
mans
robber
mans
kill
him
with
sword
and
your
mother
black
and
blue
told
the
doctor
the
whole
of
their
history
since
the
death
of
captain
gay
and
his
statements
were
substantially
true
black
and
blue
however
declared
most
positively
that
his
father
was
a
native
and
no
european
do
you
think
the
doctor
inquired
that
your
mother
would
see
me
if
i
went
down
to
her
home
o
yes
why
not
come
along
sahib
i
will
show
where
she
live
you
call
for
palanquin
and
get
on
i
run
alongside
the
doctor
curiosity
was
very
strong
and
he
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
satisfy
it
at
once
he
accepted
black
and
blue
invitation
and
went
to
the
house
occupied
by
ellen
habited
as
a
native
she
was
sitting
on
a
coarse
mat
smoking
and
at
the
same
time
mending
an
old
garment
of
her
son
the
doctor
recognised
ellen
immediately
albeit
she
was
now
aged
but
at
first
she
did
not
recognise
him
he
was
altered
very
much
in
appearance
his
hair
and
whiskers
had
become
very
grey
and
he
no
longer
wore
a
moustache
ellen
parried
all
the
questions
that
were
put
to
her
and
affected
to
be
as
much
surprised
by
them
as
by
the
doctor
visit
the
statement
of
her
son
she
supported
that
her
husband
was
a
native
of
india
o
but
surely
said
the
doctor
this
was
the
boy
whom
i
attended
at
meerut
many
years
ago
when
you
and
your
sahib
were
living
near
the
begum
bridge
the
poor
woman
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
then
repeated
his
name
and
burst
into
tears
her
recollections
crowded
before
her
too
thickly
to
admit
of
her
dissembling
any
further
with
her
visitor
and
she
admitted
that
she
was
the
widow
of
captain
gay
of
her
majesty
regiment
of
foot
the
doctor
was
under
no
promise
to
ellen
to
keep
his
discovery
secret
and
feeling
at
liberty
to
speak
of
it
did
so
publicly
as
well
as
in
private
the
peerages
were
looked
into
and
black
and
blue
pedigree
examined
there
were
the
names
of
all
the
late
lord
sons
and
sure
enough
there
was
francis
name
above
that
of
frederick
the
present
earl
opposite
to
the
name
of
francis
were
the
letters
signifying
died
unmarried
black
and
blue
of
course
became
an
object
of
great
curiosity
his
right
to
a
title
did
not
induce
him
to
alter
his
prices
in
any
way
and
hence
he
was
kicked
and
cuffed
and
abused
as
much
as
ever
by
the
young
lieutenants
and
ensigns
who
always
addressed
him
as
my
lord
and
your
lordship
pomatum
my
lord

you
say
yes
but

me

any
of
these
lads
who
had
nothing
in
the
world
beyond
their
pay
have
consented
to
an
union
between
black
and
blue
and
one
of
their
sisters
after
he
had
come
into
what
were
his
rights
no
would
the
poorest
and
most
unprincipled
officers
civil
and
military
in
the
whole
of
india
no
would
any
european
girl
of
respectability
who
had
lived
in
india
to
say
nothing
of
the
daughters
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
have
wedded
the
black
heir
to
the
title
and
estates
of
the
earl
of
millflower
no
not
in
india
could
his
sable
lordship
have
found
a
virtuous
white
woman
to
accept
his
hand
in
due
course
the
story
of
black
and
blue
birth
crept
into
the
columns
of
one
of
the
calcutta
newspapers
and
ere
long
an
attorney
of
the
supreme
court
paid
a
visit
to
the
imperial
city
and
had
an
interview
with
black
and
blue
he
proposed
to
the
to
take
him
to
england
and
establish
his
claim
to
the
estates
which
he
truthfully
represented
as
worth
more
than
half
a
million
sterling
fifty
lacs
of
rupees
he
the
attorney
would
pay
all
expenses
of
the
suit
and
in
the
event
of
success
which
was
certain
would
receive
only
five
per
cent
or
fifty
thousand
pounds
leaving
black
and
blue
a
balance
of
lacs
black
and
blue
who
loved
and
adored
money
on
hearing
such
a
sum
spoken
of
rolled
his
blue
eyes
and
red
tongue
and
almost
fainted
but
then
to
cross
the
black
water
as
the
natives
call
the
ocean
that
thought
made
him
shudder
and
shake
his
head
the
attorney
represented
to
him
that
he
should
live
in
great
comfort
during
the
voyage
that
the
best
cabin
in
the
ship
should
be
taken
for
him
that
he
should
have
servants
about
him
and
drawing
forth
a
number
of
prints
of
english
beauties
he
exhibited
them
to
the
gaze
of
black
and
blue
black
and
blue
said
he
would
consult
his
european
friends
he
did
so
and
many
of
those
friends
dissuaded
him
from
going
to
england
not
that
they
had
any
doubt
as
to
the
issue
of
his
claim
if
it
should
be
disputed
but
upon
the
reasonable
ground
that
he
was
very
happy
where
he
was
others
advised
him
to
go
by
all
means
and
take
up
his
title
and
the
wealth
that
pertained
to
it
his
mother
entreated
him
not
to
leave
her
but
in
the
end
the
voice
of
the
attorney
prevailed
and
black
and
blue
declared
himself
ready
to
accompany
him
ten
thousand
rupees
one
thousand
pounds
were
given
to
ellen
for
her
support
during
the
temporary
absence
of
her
son
who
was
to
return
as
soon
as
he
had
realized
his
lacs
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
it
was
said
that
a
mercantile
firm
in
calcutta
in
which
an
illustrious
native
gentleman
was
a
partner
advanced
the
means
required
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
the
black
man
right
to
the
earldom
the
attorney
possessed
himself
of
the
proofs
he
had
the
papers
of
the
honourable
francis
gay
amongst
which
were
letters
from
the
late
lord
millflower
to
his
eldest
brother
lord
larkspeare
he
also
in
the
presence
of
credible
witnesses
received
from
the
hands
of
ellen
the
dead
man
uniform
secondly
he
had
the
deposition
on
oath
of
the
superintending
surgeon
and
of
several
other
officers
who
were
cognizant
of
every
particular
many
gave
these
depositions
with
reluctance
but
felt
bound
to
speak
the
truth
when
interrogated
in
a
word
the
attorney
got
his
case
up
remarkably
well
black
and
blue
and
the
attorney
left
calcutta
in
one
of
the
large
passenger
ships
and
in
the
month
of
april
landed
at
gravesend
whence
they
journeyed
to
london
here
black
and
blue
was
prevailed
upon
to
wear
christian
clothes
in
his
muslin
dress
his
pink
turban
and
his
red
slippers
covered
with
gold
embroidery
black
and
blue
had
looked
an
aristocratic
native
notwithstanding
he
was
so
very
black
colour
is
no
criterion
of
high
caste
or
rank
in
india
the
late
maharajah
rooder
singh
of
darbungah
whose
family
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
burke
peerage
is
one
of
stupendous
antiquity
had
the
complexion
of
an
african
while
his
younger
brother
basdeo
who
now
sits
on
the
throne
is
far
fairer
than
his
highness
the
maharajah
dulleep
singh
but
in
his
black
trousers
black
waistcoat
black
surtout
coat
white
neckcloth
black
beaver
hat
and
wellington
boots
poor
black
and
blue
looked
truly
hideous
while
his
slouching
indian
gait
would
have
led
most
people
to
conclude
that
he
was
intoxicated
poor
black
and
blue
had
never
tasted
anything
stronger
than
water
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
the
attorney
had
an
interview
with
frederick
earl
of
millflower
he
wrote
to
the
firm
in
calcutta
to
that
effect
and
he
further
stated
that
the
earl
had
set
him
at
defiance
and
that
he
was
about
to
institute
a
suit
in
the
proper
court
this
was
the
last
that
was
ever
heard
in
india
of
black
and
blue
or
of
the
attorney
inquiries
were
instituted
but
with
no
avail
there
were
many
conjectures
the
one
most
generally
entertained
was
that
poor
black
and
blue
and
his
undoubted
claim
were
disposed
of
by
the
attorney
for
a
sum
which
satisfied
him
and
that
black
and
blue
was
secretly
led
into
indulgences
in
some
foreign
country
and
died
of
their
effects
but
his
mother
who
is
still
living
will
not
believe
that
he
is
dead
and
feels
convinced
that
some
day
or
other
he
will
turn
up
and
be
restored
to
her
what
on
earth
became
of
that
black
earl
is
a
question
very
often
put
by
many
who
were
acquainted
with
his
strange
history
the
ranee
of
jhansi
about
a
month
after
the
order
had
gone
forth
for
the
annexation
of
the
little
province
of
jhansi
in
and
previous
to
a
wing
of
the
native
infantry
occupying
the
country
i
received
a
letter
in
persian
written
upon
gold
paper
from
the
ranee
begging
me
to
pay
her
a
visit
the
letter
was
brought
to
me
by
two
natives
of
rank
one
had
been
the
financial
minister
of
the
late
rajah
the
other
was
the
head
vakeel
attorney
of
the
ranee
the
revenues
of
jhansi
were
some
six
lacs
a
year
and
after
disbursing
the
expenses
of
government
and
paying
the
troops
in
the
late
rajah
service
the
balance
was
some
two
lacs
and
a
half
profit
the
troops
were
not
numerous
under
in
all
and
they
were
chiefly
horsemen
the
arrangement
when
the
country
was
annexed
was
simply
this
that
the
ranee
should
receive
a
pension
of
a
year
to
be
paid
monthly
the
ranee
object
in
asking
me
to
visit
her
at
jhansi
was
to
consult
me
as
to
the
possibility
of
getting
the
order
for
annexation
annulled
or
reversed
i
should
mention
that
the
ranee
had
applied
to
me
at
the
instance
of
a
gentleman
of
the
civil
service
who
had
once
been
the
resident
or
agent
at
a
native
court
in
the
upper
provinces
a
gentleman
who
in
common
with
many
other
officials
of
rank
in
india
regarded
the
annexation
of
jhansi
a
trumpery
state
after
all
not
only
as
impolitic
but
unjust
and
without
excuse
the
facts
were
briefly
these
the
late
rajah
had
no
issue
by
his
only
wife
the
woman
who
caused
our
countrymen
and
countrywomen
and
children
to
be
put
to
death
in
the
fort
and
who
according
to
late
advices
has
been
killed
and
some
weeks
previous
to
his
death
being
sound
of
mind
though
infirm
in
body
he
publicly
adopted
an
heir
and
gave
notice
to
the
government
of
having
done
so
through
the
proper
channel
namely
the
representative
then
stationed
at
jhansi
in
short
all
the
forms
required
by
the
government
to
prevent
fraud
in
such
cases
had
been
complied
with
the
child
was
taken
into
the
rajah
lap
in
the
presence
of
his
assembled
people
and
in
the
presence
of
the
representative
and
he
moreover
signed
a
document
duly
attested
reciting
his
act
and
deed
the
rajah
was
a
brahmin
the
adopted
boy
was
a
near
relative
of
his
the
jhansi
rajah
had
been
particularly
faithful
to
the
british
government
and
lord
william
bentinck
had
presented
the
brother
of
the
late
rajah
with
a
british
ensign
and
a
letter
giving
him
the
title
of
rajah
and
assuring
him
that
that
title
and
the
independence
attached
to
it
would
be
guaranteed
by
the
british
government
to
him
the
rajah
and
his
heirs
and
by
adoption
that
that
treaty
for
such
it
purported
to
be
of
lord
william
bentinck
was
violated
without
the
slightest
shadow
of
a
pretence
there
can
not
be
any
sort
of
doubt
in
the
time
of
the
peishwah
the
late
rajah
of
jhansi
was
simply
a
large
zemindar
landholder
and
had
he
remained
untitled
there
can
be
no
question
that
his
last
wishes
so
far
as
the
disposition
of
his
property
was
concerned
would
have
been
attended
to
it
was
the
acceptance
of
the
rajahship
which
led
to
the
confiscation
of
his
estates
and
the
exchange
of
a
year
for
a
year
strange
as
that
assertion
may
seem
to
the
reader
it
is
nevertheless
true
i
was
at
agra
when
i
received
the
ranee
letter
and
agra
is
two
journey
even
as
i
travelled
from
jhansi
i
sympathized
with
the
woman
the
boy
whom
the
rajah
had
adopted
was
only
six
years
old
and
during
his
minority
that
is
to
say
until
he
had
attained
his
eighteenth
year
the
ranee
so
the
rajah
willed
was
to
have
been
the
regent
and
the
boy
guardian
and
it
is
no
small
matter
for
a
woman
a
native
woman
of
rank
too
to
give
up
such
a
position
and
become
a
pensioner
even
on
a
year
let
me
detail
the
particulars
of
my
journey
to
the
residence
of
the
ranee
of
jhansi
i
got
into
my
palanquin
at
dusk
and
on
the
following
morning
at
daylight
arrived
at
gwalior
the
rajah
of
jhansi
had
a
small
house
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
cantonment
which
was
used
as
a
and
thither
i
was
taken
by
the
minister
and
the
vakeel
who
accompanied
me
at
ten
after
i
had
breakfasted
and
smoked
my
hookah
it
was
proposed
that
we
go
on
at
once
the
day
was
very
warm
but
the
ranee
had
sent
a
large
and
comfortable
palanquin
carriage
in
short
it
was
more
like
a
small
room
than
a
carriage
fitted
up
as
it
was
with
every
convenience
including
even
a
punkah
which
was
pulled
from
the
outside
by
a
servant
who
sat
upon
a
in
the
carriage
beside
myself
and
the
minister
and
vakeel
was
a
khansamah
or
butler
who
with
the
apparatus
between
his
knees
kept
on
cooling
water
and
wine
and
beer
in
order
that
whenever
i
felt
thirsty
i
might
be
supplied
at
a
moment
notice
this
enormous
carriage
was
drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
of
immense
strength
and
swiftness
each
stood
about
seventeen
hands
high
the
late
rajah
had
imported
them
from
france
at
a
cost
of
the
road
was
rather
rough
in
many
places
but
on
the
average
we
got
over
it
at
the
rate
of
about
nine
miles
an
hour
at
about
two
in
the
day
we
entered
the
jhansi
territory
having
changed
horses
twice
and
we
had
now
some
nine
miles
to
drive
hitherto
we
had
been
escorted
only
by
four
sowars
horsemen
but
now
our
escort
amounted
to
about
fifty
each
horseman
carrying
an
immense
spear
and
dressed
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
irregular
cavalry
in
the
pay
of
the
east
india
company
and
along
the
road
at
intervals
of
a
few
hundred
yards
were
horsemen
drawn
up
and
as
we
passed
they
joined
the
cavalcade
so
that
by
the
time
we
came
in
sight
of
the
fortress
if
those
old
weak
walls
surmounted
by
some
nine
pieces
of
old
ordnance
of
inferior
calibre
deserved
the
name
the
whole
strength
of
the
jhansi
cavalry
was
in
attendance
the
carriage
was
driven
to
a
place
called
the
rajah
garden
where
i
alighted
and
was
conducted
by
the
financial
minister
and
the
vakeel
and
other
servants
of
state
to
a
large
tent
which
was
pitched
beneath
a
clump
of
gigantic
mango
trees
the
tent
which
was
that
in
which
the
late
rajah
used
to
receive
the
civil
and
military
officers
of
the
british
government
was
elegantly
fitted
up
and
carpeted
and
at
least
a
dozen
domestic
servants
were
ready
to
do
my
bidding
i
must
not
omit
to
mention
that
the
companions
of
my
journey
the
minister
and
the
vakeel
were
both
men
of
good
ability
and
pleasing
manners
they
were
moreover
men
of
learning
so
that
my
time
upon
the
road
had
been
beguiled
very
agreeably
the
ranee
had
consulted
one
of
the
many
brahmins
who
were
supported
by
her
as
to
the
most
propitious
hour
for
me
to
come
to
the
purdah
behind
which
she
sat
and
the
brahmins
had
told
her
that
it
must
be
between
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
the
rising
of
the
moon
which
was
then
near
her
full
in
other
words
between
five
and
six
this
important
matter
having
been
communicated
to
me
i
expressed
myself
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
time
of
the
appointment
and
ordered
dinner
accordingly
this
done
the
financial
minister
after
betraying
some
embarrassment
intimated
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
on
a
rather
delicate
subject
and
that
with
my
permission
he
would
order
all
the
menial
servants
in
attendance
on
me
including
my
own
valet
to
leave
the
tent
and
stand
at
a
distance
i
complied
of
course
and
presently
found
myself
alone
with
only
the
officials
eight
or
nine
in
number
of
the
little
native
state
of
jhansi
what
the
finance
minister
wished
to
ask
me
was
this
would
i
consent
to
leave
my
shoes
at
the
door
when
i
entered
the
apartment
i
inquired
if
the
agent
did
so
he
replied
that
the
agent
had
never
had
an
interview
with
the
ranee
and
that
the
late
rajah
had
never
received
any
european
gentleman
in
the
private
apartments
of
the
palace
but
in
a
room
set
apart
for
the
purpose
or
in
the
tent
in
which
we
were
conversing
i
was
in
some
difficulty
and
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
for
i
had
a
few
years
previously
declined
to
be
presented
to
the
king
of
delhi
who
insisted
on
europeans
taking
off
their
shoes
when
they
entered
his
presence
the
idea
was
repugnant
to
my
mind
and
i
said
as
much
to
the
minister
of
the
late
rajah
of
jhansi
and
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
attend
a
lev√©e
at
the
palace
of
the
queen
of
england
if
informed
that
he
must
enter
her
majesty
presence
with
his
head
uncovered
as
did
all
her
subjects
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
to
this
question
he
would
not
give
me
a
direct
answer
but
remarked
you
may
wear
your
hat
sahib
the
ranee
will
not
mind
that
on
the
contrary
she
will
regard
it
as
an
additional
mark
of
respect
towards
her
now
this
was
what
i
did
not
want
my
desire
was
that
she
should
consider
the
wearing
of
my
hat
supposing
i
consented
to
take
off
my
shoes
as
a
species
of
compromise
on
her
part
as
well
as
on
my
part
but
i
was
so
amused
with
this
bargaining
as
it
were
that
i
consented
giving
them
distinctly
to
understand
however
that
it
was
to
be
considered
not
as
a
compliment
to
her
rank
and
dignity
but
to
her
sex
and
her
sex
alone
that
great
point
settled
i
partook
of
a
very
sumptuous
repast
that
was
prepared
for
me
and
awaited
patiently
the
setting
of
the
sun
or
the
rising
of
the
moon
determined
however
that
i
would
wear
my
hat
a
black
covered
with
a
white
turban
the
hour
came
and
the
white
elephant
an
albino
one
of
the
very
few
in
all
india
bearing
on
his
immense
back
a
silver
houdah
trimmed
with
red
velvet
was
brought
to
the
tent
i
ascended
the
steps
which
were
also
covered
with
red
velvet
and
took
my
place
the
mahoot
or
was
attired
in
the
most
gorgeous
manner
the
ministers
of
state
mounted
on
white
arabs
rode
on
either
side
of
the
elephant
the
jhansi
cavalry
lining
the
road
to
the
palace
and
thus
forming
an
avenue
the
palace
was
about
half
a
mile
distant
from
my
encampment
ground
ere
long
we
arrived
at
the
gates
at
which
the
attendants
on
foot
began
to
knock
violently
a
wicket
was
opened
and
closed
hastily
information
was
then
sent
to
the
ranee
and
after
a
delay
of
about
ten
minutes
the
hookum
order
came
to
open
the
gates
i
entered
on
the
elephant
and
alighted
in
a
the
evening
was
very
warm
and
i
fancied
that
i
should
be
suffocated
by
the
crowd
of
natives
retainers
who
flocked
around
me
observing
my
discomfiture
the
minister
imperiously
commanded
them
to
stand
back
after
another
brief
delay
i
was
asked
to
ascend
a
very
narrow
stone
staircase
and
on
the
landing
was
met
by
a
native
gentleman
who
was
some
relative
to
the
ranee
he
showed
me
first
into
one
room
and
then
into
another
these
rooms
six
or
seven
like
all
rooms
of
the
kind
were
unfurnished
save
and
except
that
the
floors
were
carpeted
but
from
the
ceiling
punkahs
and
chandeliers
were
suspended
and
on
the
walls
were
native
pictures
of
hindoo
gods
and
goddesses
with
here
and
there
a
large
mirror
at
length
i
was
led
to
the
door
of
a
room
at
which
the
native
gentleman
knocked
a
female
voice
from
within
inquired
who
is
there
sahib
was
the
reply
after
another
brief
delay
the
door
was
opened
by
some
unseen
hand
and
the
native
gentleman
asked
me
to
enter
informing
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
about
to
leave
me
a
brief
delay
now
occurred
upon
my
part
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
could
bring
myself
to
take
off
my
shoes
at
length
however
i
accomplished
it
and
entered
the
apartment
in
stocking
feet
in
the
centre
of
the
room
which
was
richly
carpeted
was
an
of
european
manufacture
and
around
it
were
strewn
garlands
of
flowers
jhansi
is
famous
for
its
beautiful
and
flowers
at
the
end
of
the
room
was
a
purdah
or
curtain
and
behind
it
people
were
talking
i
sat
myself
down
in
the
and
instinctively
took
off
my
hat
but
recollecting
my
resolve
i
replaced
it
and
rather
firmly
pulling
it
well
down
so
as
completely
to
conceal
my
forehead
it
was
a
foolish
resolve
perhaps
on
my
part
for
the
hat
kept
the
breeze
of
the
punkah
from
cooling
my
temples
i
could
hear
female
voices
prevailing
upon
a
child
to
go
to
the
sahib
and
could
hear
the
child
objecting
to
do
so
eventually
he
was
launched
into
the
room
and
upon
my
speaking
kindly
to
the
child
he
approached
me
but
very
timidly
his
dress
and
the
jewels
on
his
person
satisfied
me
that
the
child
was
the
adopted
son
of
the
late
rajah
and
the
rejected
heir
to
the
little
throne
of
jhansi
he
was
rather
a
pretty
child
but
very
short
for
his
years
and
like
most
of
the
mahratta
children
that
i
have
seen
whilst
i
was
speaking
to
the
child
a
shrill
and
discordant
voice
issued
from
behind
the
purdah
and
i
was
informed
that
the
boy
was
the
maharajah
who
had
just
been
despoiled
of
his
rights
by
the
of
india
i
fancied
that
the
voice
was
that
of
some
very
old
woman
some
slave
or
enthusiastic
retainer
perhaps
but
the
child
having
imagined
that
he
was
spoken
to
replied
maharanee
and
thus
i
was
told
the
error
of
my
conclusion
and
now
the
ranee
having
invited
me
to
come
closer
to
the
purdah
began
to
pour
forth
her
grievances
and
whenever
she
paused
the
women
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
set
up
a
sort
of
chorus
a
series
of
melancholy
ejaculations
such
as
woe
is
me
what
oppression
it
reminded
me
somewhat
of
a
scene
in
a
greek
tragedy
comical
as
was
the
situation
i
had
heard
from
the
vakeel
that
the
ranee
was
a
very
handsome
woman
of
about
six
or
seven
and
twenty
years
of
age
and
i
was
very
curious
indeed
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
and
whether
it
was
by
accident
or
by
design
on
the
ranee
part
i
know
not
my
curiosity
was
gratified
the
curtain
was
drawn
aside
by
the
little
boy
and
i
had
a
good
view
of
the
lady
it
was
only
for
a
moment
it
is
true
still
i
saw
her
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
describe
her
she
was
a
woman
of
about
the
middle
size
rather
stout
but
not
too
stout
her
face
must
have
been
very
handsome
when
she
was
younger
and
even
now
it
had
many
charms
though
according
to
my
idea
of
beauty
it
was
too
round
the
expression
also
was
very
good
and
very
intelligent
the
eyes
were
particularly
fine
and
the
nose
very
delicately
shaped
she
was
not
very
fair
though
she
was
far
from
black
she
had
no
ornaments
strange
to
say
upon
her
person
except
a
pair
of
gold
her
dress
was
a
plain
white
muslin
so
fine
in
texture
and
drawn
about
her
in
such
a
way
and
so
tightly
that
the
outline
of
her
figure
was
plainly
discernible
and
a
remarkably
fine
figure
she
had
what
spoilt
her
was
her
voice
which
was
something
between
a
whine
and
a
croak
when
the
purdah
was
drawn
aside
she
was
or
affected
to
be
very
much
annoyed
but
presently
she
laughed
and
expressed
a
hope
that
a
sight
of
her
had
not
lessened
my
sympathy
with
her
sufferings
nor
prejudiced
her
cause
on
the
contrary
i
replied
if
the
could
only
be
as
fortunate
as
i
have
been
and
for
even
so
brief
a
while
i
feel
quite
sure
that
he
would
at
once
give
jhansi
back
again
to
be
ruled
over
by
its
beautiful
queen
she
repaid
this
compliment
and
the
next
ten
minutes
were
devoted
to
an
interchange
of
such
matters
i
told
her
that
the
whole
world
resounded
with
the
praises
of
her
beauty
and
the
greatness
of
her
intellect
and
she
told
me
that
there
was
not
a
corner
of
the
earth
in
which
prayers
for
my
welfare
remained
unsaid
we
then
returned
to
the
point
her
case
i
informed
her
that
the
had
no
power
to
restore
the
country
and
recognise
the
claim
of
the
adopted
son
without
a
reference
to
england
and
that
the
most
prudent
course
for
her
to
adopt
would
be
to
petition
the
throne
and
meanwhile
draw
the
pension
of
a
year
under
protest
that
it
was
not
to
prejudice
the
right
of
the
adopted
son
at
first
she
refused
to
do
this
and
rather
energetically
exclaimed
mera
jhansi
nahin
dengee
i
will
not
give
up
my
jhansi
i
then
pointed
out
to
her
as
delicately
as
possible
how
futile
would
be
any
opposition
and
told
her
what
was
the
truth
that
a
wing
of
a
native
regiment
and
some
artillery
were
within
three
marches
of
the
palace
and
i
further
impressed
upon
her
that
the
slightest
opposition
to
its
advance
would
destroy
her
every
hope
and
in
short
jeopardize
her
liberty
i
did
this
because
she
gave
me
to
understand
and
so
did
her
attorney
and
my
impression
is
that
they
spoke
the
truth
that
the
of
jhansi
did
not
wish
to
be
handed
over
to
the
east
india
company
rule
it
was
past
two
that
night
before
i
left
the
palace
and
ere
i
took
my
departure
i
had
talked
the
lady
into
my
way
of
thinking
except
that
she
would
not
consent
to
draw
any
pension
from
the
british
government
on
the
following
day
i
returned
to
gwalior
to
agra
the
ranee
presented
me
with
an
elephant
a
camel
an
arab
a
pair
of
greyhounds
of
great
swiftness
a
quantity
of
silks
and
stuffs
the
production
of
jhansi
and
a
pair
of
indian
shawls
i
accepted
these
things
with
great
reluctance
but
the
financial
minister
entreated
me
to
take
them
insomuch
as
it
would
wound
the
ranee
feelings
if
i
refused
the
ranee
also
presented
me
with
a
portrait
of
herself
taken
by
a
native
a
hindoo
the
state
of
jhansi
was
not
restored
to
the
rule
of
the
ranee
and
we
know
that
she
afterwards
rivalled
that
fiend
nena
sahib
whose
grievance
was
identical
with
her
own
the
government
would
not
recognise
nena
sahib
as
the
adopted
son
and
heir
of
the
peishwah
the
ranee
of
jhansi
sought
to
be
recognised
as
the
regent
during
the
minority
of
the
late
rajah
adopted
son
and
heir
tirhoot
lucknow
bhitoor
etc
it
is
some
years
since
i
first
landed
in
calcutta
i
was
in
no
way
connected
with
the
government
and
was
consequently
an
interloper
or
adventurer
these
were
the
terms
applied
by
certain
officials
to
european
merchants
shopkeepers
artisans
barristers
attorneys
and
others
it
was
not
long
before
i
made
up
my
mind
to
become
a
wanderer
in
the
east
i
had
no
occupation
was
my
own
master
and
had
a
large
tract
of
country
to
roam
about
in
my
first
step
was
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
hindostanee
and
of
persian
by
dint
of
hard
study
at
the
end
of
six
months
i
found
myself
capable
not
only
of
holding
a
conversation
but
of
arguing
a
point
in
either
of
these
languages
and
with
a
light
heart
i
took
my
departure
from
the
city
of
palaces
and
proceeded
to
monghyr
on
the
ganges
the
chief
civilian
of
that
district
had
invited
me
to
spend
a
month
with
him
every
day
i
accompanied
my
friend
to
his
court
and
thereby
got
some
insight
into
the
administration
of
justice
in
india
both
civil
and
criminal
here
too
i
first
made
acquaintance
with
thugs
several
most
notorious
characters
of
that
tribe
were
at
monghyr
not
imprisoned
but
permitted
to
move
about
they
had
been
pardoned
on
condition
that
they
would
become
informers
and
to
a
certain
extent
detectives
in
the
suppression
of
thuggee
in
the
british
dominions
it
was
a
curious
feeling
to
be
in
conversation
with
men
who
had
each
committed
his
ninety
or
a
hundred
murders
to
see
the
fingers
that
had
strangled
so
many
victims
to
watch
the
process
for
they
were
enough
to
act
it
there
was
the
unsuspecting
traveller
with
his
bundle
the
decoy
thug
who
engaged
him
in
conversation
the
two
men
who
at
the
given
signal
were
to
seize
the
executioner
standing
behind
with
the
handkerchief
ready
to
strangle
the
victim
they
even
went
through
the
operation
of
searching
the
deceased
upon
whom
they
found
nothing
in
this
case
but
they
assured
me
this
frequently
happened
in
reality
the
reader
is
of
course
aware
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
thug
religion
not
to
rob
a
live
body
the
crime
of
murder
must
precede
that
of
theft
the
play
the
tragedy
over
to
these
domesticated
demons
it
was
a
mere
farce
they
laughed
at
the
solemn
expression
which
i
doubt
not
was
stamped
upon
my
features
these
thugs
were
permitted
to
have
their
families
at
monghyr
and
one
morning
when
i
strolled
down
to
their
camp
an
old
man
made
five
children
the
eldest
boy
not
more
than
eight
years
old
go
through
the
business
of
strangling
and
robbing
a
victim
in
one
respect
these
urchins
outdid
their
progenitors
in
the
acting
they
not
only
went
through
the
ceremony
of
searching
the
dead
body
but
that
done
they
dragged
it
by
the
legs
to
a
well
and
in
dumb
show
threw
it
down
and
then
uttered
a
prayer
to
heaven
was
that
good
said
one
of
the
children
running
up
to
me
for
applause
and
a
reward
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
reply
before
i
had
time
to
give
any
answer
the
child
father
said
no
it
was
not
good
you
used
the
handkerchief
before
the
signal
was
given
go
through
it
again
and
remember
this
time
that
you
must
have
patience
the
boys
began
again
much
in
the
same
spirit
that
an
actor
and
actress
would
go
through
the
strangling
scene
in
othello
to
please
a
fastidious
manager
approaching
a
very
woman
of
about
years
of
age
i
said
to
her
what
do
you
think
of
this
she
replied
in
a
proverb
the
mango
always
falls
beneath
the
shade
of
the
parent
tree
but
the
crime
said
i
what
think
you
of
that
she
looked
up
with
as
lovely
a
pair
of
eyes
as
ever
saw
the
light
smiled
and
responded
heaven
will
hold
us
all
sahib
i
was
about
to
reason
with
her
but
her
husband
with
an
expression
of
pride
interfered
and
informed
me
that
she
had
taken
eighteen
lives
she
exclaimed
eighteen
only
said
he
she
persisted
and
ran
them
over
counting
on
her
fingers
the
places
and
the
dates
when
the
murders
were
committed
her
husband
then
admitted
that
she
was
in
the
right
and
turning
to
me
remarked
she
is
a
very
clever
woman
sahib
were
your
victims
men
or
women
i
said
to
her
all
women
she
answered
me
some
old
and
some
young
i
was
tempted
to
ask
her
to
show
me
how
it
was
done
and
after
considerable
coaxing
she
complied
with
my
wishes
to
my
surprise
she
was
the
only
actor
in
the
scene
except
the
victim
with
whom
she
went
through
the
process
of
strangling
with
a
piece
of
cord
the
victim
another
thuggess
was
supposed
to
be
sleeping
when
the
operation
was
performed
and
i
could
not
help
admiring
horrible
as
the
sight
was
the
accuracy
with
which
she
performed
the
throes
and
agony
of
death
to
borrow
an
idea
from
junius
none
but
those
who
had
frequently
witnessed
such
awful
moments
could
describe
them
so
well
at
the
house
of
my
monghyr
friend
i
met
a
french
gentleman
an
of
tirhoot
in
behar
he
invited
me
to
pay
him
a
visit
and
to
accompany
him
in
his
boat
he
was
about
to
sail
on
the
following
day
i
say
sail
for
at
that
time
the
month
of
august
the
country
was
inundated
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
travel
by
land
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
we
sailed
from
monghyr
to
hajeepore
without
going
near
the
ganges
for
several
days
monsieur
bardon
the
french
planter
was
one
of
the
most
accomplished
and
agreeable
men
i
had
ever
met
and
in
truth
one
of
the
greatest
characters
the
hospitality
of
the
tirhoot
planters
is
proverbial
in
india
and
i
believe
i
might
have
lived
in
that
garden
of
the
east
as
it
is
called
from
that
day
to
this
as
a
welcome
guest
of
the
various
planters
if
i
had
chosen
still
to
be
their
guest
as
it
was
i
was
eight
months
in
the
district
and
then
had
very
great
difficulty
in
getting
away
a
now
celebrated
officer
at
that
time
commanding
the
irregular
cavalry
at
segowlie
induced
me
to
visit
him
and
after
leaving
his
abode
i
went
to
the
bettiah
rajah
who
initiated
me
into
the
mysteries
of
it
was
in
the
dominions
of
this
small
chief
that
my
hands
and
face
were
so
browned
that
i
became
far
less
fair
than
many
natives
of
the
country
before
leaving
tirhoot
however
i
paid
a
visit
to
rooder
singh
the
rajah
of
durbungah
the
richest
native
perhaps
in
all
india
he
has
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
net
revenue
and
in
a
tank
in
his
palace
there
is
lying
in
gold
and
silver
upwards
of
a
million
and
a
half
sterling
chutter
singh
the
father
of
the
rajah
of
durbungah
was
a
firm
friend
of
the
british
government
during
the
nepal
war
he
raised
a
regiment
of
horse
and
provisioned
it
when
asked
by
the
authorities
for
his
bill
he
replied
that
the
government
owed
him
nothing
after
leaving
the
bettiah
rajah
i
proceeded
to
lucknow
where
i
improved
myself
greatly
in
hindostanee
in
this
city
and
in
delhi
the
purest
is
spoken
at
lucknow
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
ally
nucky
khan
the
prime
minister
of
the
king
of
oude
who
is
now
imprisoned
in
fort
william
of
wuzy
ally
khan
a
celebrity
of
oude
who
is
since
dead
and
of
rugburdiall
the
eldest
son
of
the
late
shah
beharee
lall
one
of
the
richest
bankers
in
india
shah
beharee
lall
is
said
to
have
died
worth
seven
millions
in
cash
but
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
three
millions
sterling
was
the
utmost
that
he
died
possessed
of
rugburdiall
held
the
office
of
treasurer
to
the
king
of
oude
ally
nucky
khan
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
man
of
small
mental
capacity
but
of
immense
cunning
and
inordinate
vanity
the
late
beechy
the
king
of
oude
must
have
taken
at
least
a
score
of
likenesses
of
ally
nucky
who
to
say
the
truth
is
a
remarkably
personage
wuzy
ally
khan
was
a
tall
and
handsome
man
of
about
his
manners
were
refined
his
address
charming
and
his
bearing
altogether
that
of
a
gentleman
of
his
talents
there
could
be
no
question
and
he
was
moreover
a
learned
and
man
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
wuzy
ally
khan
in
point
of
fact
ruled
the
kingdom
the
conversational
powers
of
this
man
were
immense
and
he
was
both
witty
and
humorous
a
more
agreeable
companion
it
would
be
difficult
to
meet
with
in
any
country
when
i
first
made
his
acquaintance
he
was
in
great
favour
with
the
then
resident
at
the
court
of
oude
but
on
the
appointment
of
colonel
sleeman
he
fell
into
disrepute
with
the
british
officials
and
continued
so
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
which
occurred
about
two
years
ago
i
was
five
months
in
oude
and
during
that
period
spoke
nothing
but
hindostanee
or
persian
i
made
a
point
of
avoiding
my
own
countrymen
and
of
associating
only
with
the
natives
of
india
previous
to
leaving
lucknow
a
letter
was
despatched
to
nena
sahib
informing
him
that
a
gentleman
of
distinction
a
most
intimate
friend
of
the
and
related
by
birth
or
marriage
to
every
member
of
the
council
in
calcutta
as
well
as
a
constant
guest
of
the
queen
of
england
was
travelling
through
hindostan
in
disguise
and
would
most
probably
by
his
presence
illumine
the
abode
of
maharajah
bahadoor
and
it
was
hoped
that
every
respect
would
be
paid
to
the
dignity
of
the
sahib
exalted
position
when
the
draft
of
this
epistle
was
read
aloud
by
the
moonshee
who
had
written
it
from
dictation
i
expostulated
on
the
ground
that
the
contents
were
not
in
accordance
with
the
truth
my
scruples
however
were
eventually
overcome
and
i
took
leave
of
my
lucknow
friends
after
being
provided
with
all
that
i
should
require
on
my
journey
of
about
miles
and
an
escort
of
fifteen
sowars
horsemen
for
the
road
at
that
time
between
lucknow
and
cawnpore
was
infested
by
robbers
about
a
mile
from
bhitoor
my
palkee
was
placed
upon
the
ground
i
was
asleep
but
awoke
and
inquired
kia
hua
what
is
the
matter
i
was
informed
by
the
bearers
of
my
palkee
that
the
maharajah
peishwa
bahadoor
had
sent
out
an
escort
in
honour
of
my
approach
and
presently
there
appeared
at
the
door
of
my
palkee
a
looking
hindoo
who
made
me
a
very
respectful
salaam
the
escort
consisted
of
eight
with
drawn
swords
and
four
sowars
the
former
running
by
the
side
of
my
palkee
encouraged
the
bearers
to
make
haste
while
the
latter
caused
their
horses
to
curvet
and
prance
and
thus
kick
up
a
frightful
dust
at
the
abode
of
the
maharajah
bahadoor
i
was
met
by
several
of
his
musahibs
courtiers
who
were
exceedingly
polite
and
conducted
me
to
a
suite
of
apartments
which
had
apparently
been
made
ready
for
my
reception
and
so
far
as
servants
were
concerned
i
was
literally
surrounded
a
sirdar
bearer
personal
attendant
or
indian
valet
took
charge
of
my
two
boxes
which
contained
my
wearing
apparel
a
khansamah
butler
followed
by
three
khidmutghars
table
servants
asked
me
if
i
would
take
some
iced
water
and
in
the
same
breath
informed
me
that
every
kind
of
european
drink
was
at
hand
brandy
gin
champagne
claret
sherry
port
beer
and
and
what
would
i
take
for
dinner
whatever
the
sahib
heart
might
desire
was
in
readiness
turkey
goose
duck
fowl
beefsteak
ham
and
eggs
and
here
the
khansamah
a
venerable
mussulman
informed
me
sotto
voce
that
the
maharajah
was
constantly
in
the
habit
of
entertaining
european
gentlemen
and
that
although
his
highness
was
himself
a
strict
hindoo
he
had
no
kind
of
prejudice
so
that
if
i
preferred
beef
to
any
other
kind
of
meat
i
had
only
to
give
the
order
i
assured
the
khansamah
that
since
my
arrival
in
india
i
had
never
tasted
beef
or
hog
flesh
and
that
if
he
would
have
prepared
for
me
as
speedily
as
possible
some
rice
and
vegetables
i
should
be
quite
satisfied
with
a
profound
salaam
the
khansamah
took
his
departure
followed
by
the
khidmutghars
the
sirdar
bearers
and
four
other
men
then
approached
me
reverentially
and
begged
to
conduct
me
to
my
sleeping
apartment
and
the
there
is
something
peculiarly
quaint
about
the
arrangement
of
european
furniture
in
the
house
of
a
native
gentleman
in
the
house
of
an
european
the
servants
are
of
course
taught
how
to
arrange
tables
chairs
and
beds
according
to
european
ideas
but
it
is
otherwise
with
the
servants
of
a
rajah
or
native
gentleman
the
consequence
is
that
in
the
dining
or
you
will
find
a
stand
and
a
chest
of
drawers
and
a
while
in
the
you
will
perhaps
discover
an
old
piano
an
organ
a
or
cheffonier
the
furniture
has
for
the
most
part
been
purchased
at
various
sales
and
has
belonged
to
officers
of
all
grades
civil
and
military
there
are
the
and
the
of
the
dead
ensign
in
the
same
room
with
the
table
and
crimson
damask
covered
easy
chair
of
some
luxurious
judge
on
the
mantelpiece
you
will
find
a
costly
clock
of
the
most
elegant
design
and
workmanship
and
on
each
side
of
it
a
pair
of
japan
candlesticks
not
worth
in
this
way
are
arranged
the
pictures
on
the
walls
immediately
underneath
a
proof
print
of
landseer
bolton
abbey
or
hawking
you
will
observe
a
sixpenny
coloured
print
of
the
duke
of
wellington
or
napoleon
bonaparte
the
pictures
also
have
been
bought
indiscriminately
at
various
sales
and
have
been
as
indiscriminately
suspended
on
the
walls
there
are
the
ballet
girls
intermingled
with
engravings
of
the
most
serious
character
fores
sporting
collection
with
the
most
classical
subjects
and
elegantly
bound
books
plated
dishes
and
teapots
are
arranged
in
the
most
grotesque
fashion
imaginable
upon
an
elegant
mahogany
sideboard
you
will
find
decanters
and
glasses
of
every
description
and
quality
upon
another
sideboard
in
the
you
will
find
a
variety
of
and
earthen
fragments
thereof
all
mixed
there
was
but
one
set
of
rooms
at
bhitoor
for
the
reception
of
sahib
logue
and
this
was
the
set
that
i
then
occupied
i
had
scarcely
made
myself
comfortable
when
the
khansamah
informed
me
that
dinner
was
on
the
table
this
was
welcome
intelligence
for
i
had
not
tasted
food
since
morning
and
it
was
five
i
sat
down
to
a
table
twenty
feet
long
it
had
originally
been
the
mess
table
of
a
cavalry
regiment
which
was
covered
with
a
damask
of
european
manufacture
but
instead
of
a
there
was
a
towel
the
soup
for
he
had
everything
ready
was
served
up
in
a
which
had
formed
part
of
a
dessert
service
belonging
to
the
lancers
at
all
events
the
arms
of
that
regiment
were
upon
it
but
the
plate
into
which
i
ladled
it
with
a
broken
was
of
the
old
willow
pattern
the
pilao
which
followed
the
soup
was
served
upon
a
huge
plated
dish
but
the
plate
from
which
i
ate
it
was
of
the
very
commonest
description
the
knife
was
a
affair
the
spoon
and
the
fork
were
of
silver
and
of
calcutta
make
the
plated
containing
vegetables
were
odd
ones
one
was
round
the
other
oval
the
pudding
was
brought
in
upon
a
of
blue
and
gold
pattern
and
the
cheese
was
placed
before
me
on
a
glass
dish
belonging
to
a
dessert
service
the
cool
claret
i
drank
out
of
a
richly
cut
champagne
glass
and
the
beer
out
of
an
american
tumbler
of
the
very
worst
quality
i
had
not
yet
seen
the
maharajah
it
was
not
until
past
eight
that
a
moonshee
came
and
inquired
if
i
would
have
an
interview
with
his
highness
i
replied
that
it
would
give
me
great
joy
and
was
forthwith
conducted
through
numerous
narrow
and
gloomy
passages
to
an
apartment
at
the
corner
of
the
building
here
sat
the
maharajah
on
a
turkey
carpet
and
reclining
slightly
on
a
huge
bolster
in
front
of
him
were
his
hookah
a
sword
and
several
nosegays
his
highness
rose
came
forward
took
my
hand
led
me
to
the
carpet
and
begged
of
me
to
be
seated
on
a
which
had
evidently
been
placed
ready
for
my
especial
ease
and
occupation
after
the
usual
compliments
had
passed
the
maharajah
inquired
if
i
had
eaten
well
but
perhaps
the
general
reader
would
like
to
know
what
are
the
usual
compliments
native
rajah
the
whole
world
is
ringing
with
the
praise
of
your
illustrious
name
humble
sahib

that
you
have
no
equal
is
it
true
humble
sahib
who
if
he
knows
anything
of
asiatic
manners
and
customs
knows
that
he
must
not
contradict
his
host
but
eat
his
compliments
with
a
good
appetite
maharaj
native
rajah
the
acuteness
of
your
perceptions
and
the
soundness
of
your
understanding
have
by
universal
report
became
as
manifest
as
even
the
light
of
the
sun
itself
then
turning
to
his
attendants
of
every
degree
who
by
this
time
had
formed
a
circle
round
me
and
the
rajah
he
put
the
question
is
it
true
or
not
the
attendants
one
and
all
declare
that
it
was
true
and
inquire
whether
it
could
be
possible
for
a
great
man
like
the
maharajah
to
say
that
which
was
false

a
great

humble
sahib

you
have
honoured
the
memory
of
my

it
in
my
esteem
by

an
opinion

your

is
the

humble

on

point

i
can
not
offer
an
opinion
native
rajah
you
need
not
do
so
to
look
in
your
face
is
quite
sufficient
i
would
give
a
crore
of
rupees
one
million
sterling
to
see
her
only
for
one
moment
and
say
how
much
i
admired
the
intelligent
countenance
of
her
son
i
am
going
to
england
next
year
will
the
sahib
favour
me
with
her
address
humble

here
the

calls
to

to
bring

and

the
moonshee

sits
before
me
pen
in

looks
inquiringly
into

this
mystification
must

the
plea
that

are
as
truthful
as

the

then
gives
instructions
that
that

shall
be
preserved

course
no
native
would
smoke
out
of
it
on
the
ground
of
caste
and
it
is
evidently
kept
for
the
use
of
the
sahib
logue
while
i
am
pulling
away
at
the
hookah
the
musahibs
or
favourites
of
the
rajah
flatter
me
in
very
audible
whispers
how
well
he
smokes
what
a
fine
forehead
he
has
and
his
eyes
how
they
sparkle
no
wonder
he
is
so
clever
he
will
be
some
day
god
will
have
it
so
native
rajah
sahib
when
you
become
you
will
be
a
friend
to
the
poor
humble
sahib
speaking
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
most
assuredly
maharaj
native
rajah
and
you
will
listen
to
the
petition
of
every
man
rich
and
poor
alike
humble
sahib
it
will
be
my
duty
so
to
do
native
rajah
in
a
loud
voice
moonshee
moonshee
who
is
close
at
hand
maharaj
protector
of
the
poor
native
rajah
bring
the
petition
that
i
have
laid
before
the
the
moonshee
produces
the
petition
and
at
the
instance
of
the
rajah
reads
or
rather
sings
it
aloud
the
rajah
listens
with
pleasure
to
its
recital
of
his
own
wrongs
and
i
affect
to
be
astounded
that
so
much
injustice
can
possibly
exist
during
my
rambles
in
india
i
have
been
the
guest
of
some
scores
of
rajahs
great
and
small
and
i
never
knew
one
who
had
not
a
grievance
he
had
either
been
wronged
by
the
government
or
by
some
judge
whose
decision
had
been
against
him
in
the
matter
of
the
government
it
was
a
sheer
love
of
oppression
that
led
to
the
evil
of
which
he
complained
in
the
matter
of
the
judge
that
functionary
had
been
bribed
by
the
other
party
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
kept
my
eyes
open
while
the
petition
a
very
long
one
was
read
aloud
shortly
after
it
was
finished
i
craved
permission
to
retire
and
was
conducted
by
a
bearer
to
the
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
huge
bedstead
a
but
devoid
of
curtains
on
either
side
were
large
in
gilt
frames
not
suspended
on
the
walls
but
placed
against
them
over
the
bed
was
a
punkah
which
was
immediately
set
in
motion
the
movement
of
the
punkah
served
a
double
purpose
it
cooled
the
room
and
drove
away
the
musquitoes
having
thrown
myself
on
the
bed
the
bearer
who
was
in
attendance
inquired
if
i
would
be
shampooed
this
was
a
luxury
to
which
i
was
always
partial
and
having
signified
that
i
desired
it
four
men
were
shouted
for
each
took
an
arm
or
a
leg
and
began
to
press
it
and
crack
the
of
my
fingers
and
toes
this
continued
until
i
had
fallen
asleep
i
did
not
wake
until
eight
on
the
following
morning
when
i
was
waited
upon
by
the
khansamah
who
wished
to
know
my
pleasure
with
respect
to
breakfast
he
informed
me
that
he
had
futnum
and
meesum
yorkshire
pie
game
pie
anchovy
toast
steak
sardines
in
short
all
that
the
sahib
logue
were
accustomed
to
take
my
breakfast
over
and
my
hookah
smoked
i
lighted
a
cheroot
and
walked
out
into
a
verandah
where
i
was
soon
joined
by
some
of
the
maharajah
favourites
and
dependents
who
poured
into
my
ear
a
repetition
of
the
flattery
to
which
i
had
listened
on
the
previous
night
it
is
not
very
tedious
when
you
become
used
to
it
and
know
that
it
is
a
matter
of
course
and
is
applied
to
every
european
guest
of
any
real
or
supposed
importance
whilst
thus
engaged
smoking
and
listening
i
was
joined
by
the
maharajah
who
held
in
his
hand
the
delhi
gazette
the
mofussilite
and
the
calcutta
englishman
of
their
entire
contents
he
had
been
made
acquainted
by
a
whom
he
kept
so
he
informed
me
for
the
sole
purpose
of
translating
orally
into
hindostanee
the
indian
journals
and
the
government
gazettes
published
in
the
english
language
there
was
no
occasion
for
me
to
read
these
papers
for
the
maharajah
gave
me
a
very
accurate
resum√©
of
them
having
done
this
he
asked
me
to
play
a
game
of
billiards
i
am
not
a
bad
on
the
contrary
i
have
the
vanity
to
think
that
i
play
remarkably
well
but
it
was
quite
evident
to
me
that
the
maharajah
did
not
play
his
best
and
that
he
suffered
me
to
beat
him
as
easily
as
i
did
simply
out
of
what
he
considered
to
be
politeness
all
the
while
we
were
playing
the
favourites
or
courtiers
of
the
maharajah
were
praising
us
both
neither
of
us
made
a
stroke
good
or
bad
that
did
not
bring
down
a
shower
of
compliments
my
impression
is
that
if
i
had
run
a
cue
and
cut
the
cloth
at
the
same
time
the
bystanders
would
have
shouted
in
praise
of
my
skill
and
execution
i
had
already
seen
enough
of
native
character
to
know
exactly
how
i
was
to
act
i
feigned
to
be
charmed
with
my
success
childishly
charmed
whilst
i
was
thus
to
the
delight
of
my
host
ostensibly
revelling
in
my
triumph
the
marker
a
native
a
hindoo
took
up
a
cue
and
began
to
knock
the
balls
about
he
cannoned
all
over
the
table
went
in
off
the
red
and
white
screwed
back
under
the
cushion
and
in
short
did
whatever
he
pleased
and
with
perfect
ease
i
could
not
help
expressing
to
the
rajah
my
astonishment
at
the
hindoo
marker
skill
whereupon
he
informed
me
that
when
he
was
a
mere
boy
he
had
been
taught
by
the
best
player
an
officer
in
the
light
cavalry
that
ever
came
to
india
and
that
for
several
years
past
he
had
been
marker
at
various
where
billiards
were
played
the
name
of
this
hindoo
jonathan
was
runjeet
he
was
years
of
age
about
five
feet
five
in
height
remarkably
slim
had
a
very
handsome
face
and
eyes
full
of
fire
and
spirit
he
was
for
a
long
time
marker
to
the
horse
artillery
mess
at
meerut
where
i
once
saw
him
play
a
game
with
an
officer
celebrated
for
his
skill
runjeet
gave
his
adversary
sixty
points
out
of
a
hundred
and
won
easily
what
with
his
pay
or
salary
the
presents
he
received
from
gentlemen
to
whom
he
taught
the
game
and
the
gold
mohurs
that
he
occasionally
had
given
to
him
when
he
won
bets
for
his
backers
runjeet
was
in
possession
of
some
six
hundred
pounds
but
he
was
so
extravagant
in
his
habits
that
he
spent
every
anna
and
died
i
was
told
not
worth
money
enough
to
buy
the
wood
to
burn
him
the
maharajah
on
leaving
the
invited
me
to
accompany
him
to
cawnpore
i
acquiesced
and
the
carriage
was
ordered
the
carriage
was
a
very
handsome
landau
and
the
horses
were
english
horses
but
the
harness
it
was
of
the
very
commonest
kind
and
worn
out
for
one
of
the
traces
was
a
piece
of
rope
the
coachman
was
filthy
in
his
dress
and
the
whip
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
was
an
old
broken
which
some
european
gentleman
must
have
thrown
away
on
the
box
on
either
side
of
the
coachman
sat
a
warlike
retainer
armed
with
a
sword
and
a
dagger
in
the
rumble
were
two
other
retainers
armed
in
the
same
manner
besides
the
rajah
and
myself
there
were
three
others
natives
and
relatives
of
the
rajah
in
the
vehicle
on
the
road
the
rajah
talked
incessantly
and
amongst
other
things
that
he
told
me
was
this
in
reference
to
the
praises
that
i
bestowed
on
his
equipage
not
long
ago
i
had
a
carriage
and
horses
very
superior
to
these
they
cost
me
thousand
rupees
but
i
had
to
burn
the
carriage
and
kill
the
horses
why
so
the
child
of
a
certain
sahib
in
cawnpore
was
very
sick
and
the
sahib
and
the
were
bringing
the
child
to
bhitoor
for
a
change
of
air
i
sent
my
big
carriage
for
them
on
the
road
the
child
died
and
of
course
as
a
dead
body
had
been
in
the
carriage
and
as
the
horses
had
drawn
that
dead
body
in
that
carriage
i
could
never
use
them
again
the
reader
must
understand
that
a
native
of
any
rank
considers
it
a
disgrace
to
sell
property
but
could
you
not
have
given
the
horses
to
some
friend
a
christian
or
a
mussulman
no
had
i
done
so
it
might
have
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
sahib
and
his
feelings
would
have
been
hurt
at
having
occasioned
me
such
a
loss
such
was
the
maharajah
commonly
known
as
nena
sahib
he
appeared
to
me
not
a
man
of
ability
nor
a
fool
he
was
selfish
but
what
native
is
not
he
seemed
to
be
far
from
a
bigot
in
matters
of
religion
and
although
he
was
compelled
to
be
so
very
particular
about
the
destruction
of
his
carriage
and
horses
i
am
quite
satisfied
that
he
drank
brandy
and
that
he
smoked
hemp
in
the
chillum
of
his
hookah
it
was
five
when
we
arrived
at
cawnpore
the
officers
civil
and
military
and
their
wives
were
just
coming
out
for
their
evening
drive
on
the
mall
some
were
in
carriages
some
in
buggies
some
on
horseback
every
soul
saluted
the
maharajah
who
returned
the
salute
according
to
eastern
fashion
raising
the
hands
to
the
forehead
several
gentlemen
approached
the
carriage
when
it
was
drawn
up
near
the
and
inquired
after
the
health
he
replied
that
it
was
good
and
then
introduced
me
to
them
in
the
following
manner
and
in
strict
accordance
with
the
letter
he
had
received
from
lucknow
this
sahib
who
sits
near
me
is
a
great
friend
of
the
and
is
a
relation
of
all
the
members
of
council
a
constant
guest
of
the
queen
of
england
then
came
this
addition
of
his
own
and
of
both
houses
of
parliament
i
need
scarcely
say
that
i
wished
my
lucknow
friends
had
not
covered
me
with
such
recommendations
for
wherever
we
went
and
to
whomsoever
we
spoke
no
matter
whether
it
was
an
european
shopkeeper
or
an
official
magnate
of
cawnpore
i
was
doomed
to
hear
this
sahib
who
sits
or
stands
near
me
is
a
great
friend
having
exhibited
me
sufficiently
in
cawnpore
the
heads
of
the
horses
were
turned
towards
bhitoor
and
we
were
dragged
along
the
road
at
a
slow
pace
for
the
animals
were
extremely
fatigued
the
natives
of
india
have
no
mercy
on
their
cattle
especially
their
horses
during
the
ride
back
i
was
again
bored
with
the
rajah
grievance
and
to
quiet
him
for
he
became
very
much
excited
i
was
induced
to
promise
that
i
would
talk
to
the
and
the
council
on
the
subject
and
that
if
i
did
not
succeed
in
that
quarter
i
would
on
my
return
to
england
take
the
earliest
opportunity
some
day
quietly
after
dinner
this
was
his
suggestion
of
representing
to
her
majesty
the
exact
state
of
the
case
and
that
an
adopted
son
of
a
hindoo
was
entitled
to
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
an
heir
born
of
the
body
i
furthermore
promised
him
most
solemnly
that
i
would
not
speak
to
the
board
of
control
or
to
the
privy
council
on
the
subject
for
the
maharajah
assured
me
that
he
had
the
most
positive
proof
that
both
these
institutions
had
eaten
bribes
from
the
hand
of
the
east
india
company
in
respect
of
his
claim
on
probing
him
however
i
discovered
that
this
positive
proof
was
a
letter
from
a
villanous
agent
in
england
who
had
written
to
him
to
say
that
the
company
had
bribed
the
board
of
control
and
the
privy
council
and
that
if
his
highness
expected
to
succeed
he
must
bribe
over
the
head
of
the
company
three
lacs
thirty
thousand
pounds
would
do
it
all
the
maharajah
gave
a
nautch
native
dance
by
women
that
night
on
the
following
morning
i
awoke
with
a
very
bad
headache
and
in
a
philosophic
mood
the
various
perfumes
which
had
been
sprinkled
over
my
dress
had
somewhat
overpowered
me
and
it
may
have
been
that
the
story
told
me
in
whispers
by
one
of
the
three
slaves
who
came
to
sing
me
to
sleep
had
disordered
my
imagination
i
was
told
that
two
women
of
rank
were
kept
in
a
den
not
far
from
my
apartments
and
treated
like
wild
beasts
and
a
third
a
beautiful
young
creature
had
recently
been
bricked
up
in
a
wall
for
no
other
fault
than
attempting
to
escape
after
breakfast
the
rajah
showed
me
his
elephants
his
camels
his
horses
his
dogs
his
pigeons
his
falcons
his
wild
asses
his
apes
his
aviary
full
of
birds
and
all
the
rest
of
his
curiosities
then
he
exhibited
his
guns
and
pistols
by
purdey
egg
and
other
celebrated
makers
his
swords
and
his
daggers
of
every
country
and
age
and
when
he
had
observed
that
he
was
very
happy
under
the
influence
of
some
stimulant
recently
imbibed
i
took
an
opportunity
of
discoursing
on
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
and
especially
with
reference
to
his
grievance
i
translated
many
sentiments
of
juvenal
and
horace
into
hindoostanee
but
i
regret
to
say
they
had
no
effect
on
nena
sahib
footnote
the
word
logue
simply
signifies
people
but
when
applied
as
above
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
plural
sahib
logue
sahibs
mem
logue
ladies
baba
logue
children
the
upper
provinces
it
is
impossible
for
an
english
gentleman
to
take
his
departure
from
the
house
of
a
native
of
india
without
giving
a
number
of
testimonials
in
the
shape
of
letters
of
recommendation
addressed
to
no
one
in
particular
nena
sahib
had
a
book
containing
the
autographs
of
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
had
testified
in
writing
to
the
attention
and
kindness
they
had
received
at
the
hands
of
the
maharajah
during
their
stay
at
bhitoor
having
expressed
my
satisfaction
as
emphatically
as
possible
in
this
book
the
khansamah
house
steward
demanded
a
certificate
which
i
gave
him
then
came
the
bearer
the
men
who
guarded
my
door
the
coachman
the
grooms
the
sweeper
for
each
and
all
of
these
i
had
to
write
characters
and
recommend
them
to
such
of
my
friends
as
they
might
encounter
by
accident
or
otherwise
it
is
a
fearful
infliction
this
character
writing
but
every
one
is
compelled
to
go
through
it
i
was
now
on
my
road
to
agra
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
schoolfellow
who
was
then
in
the
civil
service
and
filling
an
appointment
in
the
station
it
was
in
the
month
of
september
that
i
made
the
journey
the
most
unhealthy
season
of
the
year
opposite
to
the
first
d√¢k
bungalow
some
twelve
miles
from
the
station
of
cawnpore
i
was
stopped
by
a
set
of
twelve
palkee
bearers
who
informed
me
that
a
sahib
whom
they
were
taking
to
allyghur
had
been
seized
with
cholera
and
was
dying
in
the
bungalow
i
hastened
to
the
room
and
there
found
stretched
upon
the
couch
a
young
officer
of
about
nineteen
years
of
age
his
face
was
ashy
pale
and
a
profuse
cold
perspiration
stood
upon
his
forehead
his
hands
and
feet
were
like
ice
and
he
was
in
very
great
pain
the
only
person
near
him
was
the
sweeper
who
kept
on
assuring
me
that
the
youth
would
die
as
for
the
youth
himself
he
was
past
speech
and
i
was
disposed
to
think
with
the
sweeper
that
he
was
beyond
cure
i
administered
however
nearly
a
teaspoonful
of
laudanum
in
a
of
raw
brandy
and
then
took
a
seat
near
the
patient
in
order
to
witness
the
effect
ere
long
the
severe
pain
was
allayed
and
the
youth
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
from
which
i
began
to
fear
he
would
never
awake
to
have
administered
a
smaller
dose
at
that
stage
of
the
disease
would
have
been
useless
for
the
body
was
on
the
very
verge
of
collapse
nevertheless
i
began
to
feel
the
awkwardness
of
the
responsibility
which
i
had
taken
upon
myself
presently
a
palanquin
carriage
propelled
by
bearers
came
to
the
bungalow
an
elderly
lady
and
gentleman
alighted
and
were
shown
into
a
little
room
which
happened
to
be
vacant
a
d√¢k
bungalow
has
only
two
little
rooms
to
my
great
joy
i
discovered
that
the
new
arrival
was
a
doctor
of
a
regiment
who
with
his
wife
was
journeying
to
calcutta
i
was
not
long
in
calling
in
the
doctor
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
him
pronounce
an
opinion
that
the
young
ensign
was
all
right
and
that
the
dose
i
had
administered
had
been
the
means
of
saving
his
life
how
readily
to
be
sure
do
people
in
india
accommodate
each
other
although
the
doctor
and
his
wife
were
hurrying
down
the
country
and
albeit
the
youth
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
they
remained
with
me
until
the
following
afternoon
when
having
dined
we
all
took
our
departure
together
the
youth
and
i
travelling
northward
the
doctor
and
his
wife
in
the
opposite
direction
the
night
was
pitchy
dark
but
the
glare
from
the
torches
rendered
every
object
near
to
us
distinctly
visible
the
light
shining
on
the
black
faces
of
the
palkee
bearers
they
appeared
like
so
many
demons
but
very
merry
demons
for
they
chatted
and
laughed
incessantly
until
i
commanded
them
to
be
silent
in
order
that
while
we
moved
along
the
road
i
might
listen
to
the
ensign
story
which
he
told
me
in
the
most
artless
manner
imaginable
i
have
only
been
six
weeks
in
india
he
began
and
at
present
only
know
a
few
words
of
the
language
how
i
came
into
the
bengal
army
was
this
my
father
was
in
the
civil
service
of
the
company
in
the
madras
presidency
and
after
years
service
retired
on
his
pension
of
one
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
his
savings
which
amounted
to
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
which
were
invested
in
five
per
cent
government
securities
so
that
his
income
was
two
thousand
a
year
we
lived
during
the
winter
near
a
house
of
which
my
father
bought
the
lease
for
twenty
years
and
the
summer
we
used
to
spend
at
a
little
place
in
berkshire
which
he
had
bought
it
was
only
a
good
sized
cottage
and
the
land
about
it
did
not
exceed
three
acres
but
it
was
a
perfect
gem
of
a
residence
and
quite
large
enough
for
our
family
which
consisted
of
my
father
and
mother
myself
and
a
sister
who
is
a
year
and
a
half
older
than
i
am
i
was
at
harrow
my
father
intended
that
i
should
go
to
oxford
and
eventually
be
called
to
the
bar
my
sister
had
a
governess
a
very
clever
and
accomplished
girl
and
the
most
amiable
creature
that
ever
lived
we
were
not
an
extravagant
family
and
saw
very
little
company
but
we
had
every
comfort
that
a
reasonable
heart
could
desire
and
i
fancy
that
we
lived
up
to
the
two
thousand
pounds
a
year
you
see
the
education
of
myself
and
my
sister
was
a
heavy
item
the
governess
had
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
then
there
was
a
and
a
drawing
master
about
two
years
ago
my
father
died
and
my
mother
became
almost
imbecile
from
the
excess
of
her
grief
she
lost
her
memory
and
for
days
together
knew
not
what
she
was
doing
under
my
father
will
she
was
entitled
to
all
that
he
died
possessed
of
and
was
appointed
his
sole
executrix
the
house
in
was
given
up
the
unexpired
portion
of
the
lease
disposed
of
and
the
little
place
in
berkshire
became
our
only
home
my
father
pension
of
course
expired
when
he
died
and
we
the
family
had
now
to
live
on
the
interest
of
the
government
securities
my
mother
who
was
as
ignorant
as
a
child
on
all
matters
of
business
was
recommended
to
sell
her
government
securities
and
invest
the
proceeds
in
a
bank
which
was
paying
and
for
more
than
a
year
did
pay
eight
per
cent
but
alas
one
wretched
day
the
bank
failed
and
we
were
reduced
suddenly
from
comparative
affluence
to
poverty
the
cottage
furniture
and
all
that
my
mother
possessed
was
seized
and
sold
this
happened
only
two
years
ago
fortunately
for
me
my
school
education
was
pretty
well
completed
but
of
course
the
idea
of
my
going
to
oxford
and
subsequently
to
the
bar
was
at
once
abandoned
my
sister
was
obliged
to
take
a
situation
as
governess
in
the
family
of
a
director
of
the
east
india
company
and
through
that
gentleman
influence
i
obtained
an
ensigncy
in
the
native
infantry
the
loss
of
her
fortune
the
parting
with
my
sister
who
is
now
on
the
continent
with
the
director
family
and
myself
had
such
an
effect
upon
my
mother
that
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
place
her
in
an
asylum
where
at
all
events
she
will
be
taken
care
of
and
treated
with
kindness
but
i
have
my
plans
exclaimed
the
young
man
who
had
just
escaped
the
jaws
of
death
in
ten
years
i
will
save
enough
to
take
me
home
to
them
for
if
i
study
hard
and
i
will
do
so
i
may
get
a
staff
appointment
and
here
the
bearers
of
my
palkee
informed
me
that
two
other
travellers
were
coming
down
the
road
they
saw
the
light
in
the
distance
more
than
a
mile
off
and
they
the
bearers
began
to
talk
loudly
and
argue
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
hear
what
the
ensign
was
saying
and
all
attempts
to
silence
them
were
vain
they
were
discussing
as
they
carried
us
along
whether
they
would
exchange
burdens
with
the
bearers
insomuch
as
they
were
nearly
midway
between
the
stages
this
is
very
often
done
by
arrangement
between
them
and
thus
in
such
cases
they
get
back
more
speedily
to
their
homes
it
was
decided
that
the
exchange
should
take
place
if
the
other
party
were
agreeable
for
on
the
travellers
nearing
us
the
bearers
of
us
the
travellers
called
a
halt
forthwith
the
four
palkees
were
gently
lowered
till
they
rested
on
the
ground
and
now
the
chattering
of
the
bearers
became
something
awful
a
native
of
hindostan
can
settle
nothing
without
a
noise
and
as
each
palkee
had
twelve
men
attached
to
it
besides
the
and
those
who
carried
our
boxes
the
number
of
voices
whooping
shouting
asserting
contradicting
scolding
and
soothing
exceeded
sixty
i
and
my
companion
the
ensign
shout
to
them
to
go
on
at
length
i
got
out
of
my
palkee
in
a
rage
and
not
only
screamed
at
but
shook
several
of
the
black
disputants
whilst
thus
engaged
the
doors
of
one
of
the
downward
palkees
were
opened
and
a
voice
that
of
a
lady
thus
greeted
me
very
good
humouredly
my
good
sir
depend
upon
it
that
you
are
retarding
your
own
progress
and
ours
by
attempting
so
violently
to
accelerate
it
pray
let
them
settle
their
little
affair
amongst
themselves
i
believe
you
are
quite
right
i
replied
have
you
any
idea
of
the
hour
she
asked
yes
it
is
about
a
quarter
to
twelve
said
i
i
have
lost
the
key
of
my
watch
perhaps
the
key
of
yours
would
fit
it
i
hastened
to
my
palkee
brought
forth
from
beneath
the
pillow
my
watch
and
chain
and
taking
them
to
the
door
of
the
lady
palkee
presented
them
through
the
opening
thanks
said
the
lady
after
winding
up
her
watch
thanks
it
does
very
well
and
she
returned
the
watch
and
chain
i
saw
by
the
light
of
the
torch
not
only
her
hand
which
was
very
small
and
pretty
but
her
face
which
was
more
bewitching
still
being
lovely
and
young
is
there
anything
else
you
require
i
asked
nothing
unless
you
happen
to
have
with
you
some
fresh
bread
my
children
who
are
asleep
in
the
other
palkee
are
tired
of
biscuits
and
i
imagine
we
shall
not
reach
cawnpore
before
it
happened
that
i
had
a
loaf
in
my
palkee
and
with
all
the
pleasure
of
which
the
heart
of
man
is
capable
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
the
fair
traveller
on
this
occasion
she
opened
the
doors
of
her
palkee
sufficiently
wide
to
admit
of
my
having
a
really
good
gaze
at
her
beautiful
features
she
was
enveloped
in
a
white
and
wore
a
hood
made
of
black
silk
and
lined
with
pink
her
hair
was
brushed
back
off
the
forehead
but
the
long
dark
tresses
came
from
behind
the
ears
and
rested
on
her
covered
shoulders
are
you
going
to
agra
she
inquired
yes
i
replied
perhaps
you
would
be
good
enough
to
return
two
books
for
me
to
the
wife
of
the
assistant
magistrate
they
will
no
doubt
afford
you
as
much
amusement
on
your
journey
as
they
have
afforded
me
i
finished
them
this
afternoon
and
they
are
now
an
encumbrance
with
these
words
she
handed
me
the
volumes
which
i
faithfully
promised
to
return
by
this
time
the
bearers
had
settled
their
affair
and
were
ready
to
lift
the
palkees
i
bade
the
fair
traveller
good
night
and
a
safe
journey
we
shook
hands
the
reader
may
ask
who
was
your
friend
i
did
not
know
at
the
time
it
was
not
until
i
had
arrived
at
agra
that
i
was
informed
on
this
head
the
books
which
she
entrusted
to
my
care
i
had
not
read
and
after
parting
with
the
ensign
at
the
d√¢k
bungalow
at
bewah
they
were
indeed
most
agreeable
companions
i
have
mentioned
this
little
episode
in
my
journey
not
because
there
is
anything
in
it
worth
recording
or
because
there
is
anything
romantic
therewith
connected
but
simply
to
show
how
readily
we
christians
in
india
obliged
one
another
albeit
utter
strangers
and
how
gladly
we
assist
each
other
whenever
and
wherever
we
meet
such
an
episode
in
the
journey
of
a
traveller
in
india
is
one
of
its
most
commonplace
incidents
since
the
news
of
the
recent
deplorable
disasters
has
reached
this
country
many
persons
have
expressed
their
surprise
that
a
lady
should
be
suffered
to
travel
alone
with
her
children
or
be
accompanied
by
no
more
than
one
female
servant
the
fact
is
or
rather
was
that
on
any
dangerous
road
a
lady
utterly
unprotected
was
safer
than
a
gentleman
the
sex
was
actually
its
own
protection
during
my
stay
in
india
i
knew
of
at
least
a
score
of
instances
in
which
officers
and
civilians
were
stopped
upon
the
roads
plundered
assaulted
and
in
one
or
two
cases
murdered
in
the
upper
provinces
but
i
can
only
bring
to
mind
two
instances
of
european
ladies
having
been
molested
this
is
not
to
be
attributed
to
any
ideas
of
gallantry
or
chivalry
on
the
part
of
marauders
in
the
east
but
simply
to
the
fact
that
they
knew
the
perpetrators
of
an
offence
committed
against
a
lady
would
be
hunted
down
to
the
death
while
the
sympathies
entertained
for
the
sufferings
of
a
sahib
would
be
only
those
of
an
ordinary
character
and
soon
blow
over
even
the
knew
the
amount
of
responsibility
that
attached
to
them
when
they
bore
away
from
station
to
station
a
female
burden
and
had
the
lady
traveller
been
annoyed
or
interrupted
by
an
european
traveller
they
would
have
attacked
and
beaten
him
even
to
the
breaking
of
his
bones
and
the
danger
of
his
life
had
he
not
desisted
when
commanded
by
the
lady
to
do
so
this
has
happened
more
than
once
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
in
december
eighteen
hundred
and
the
road
between
saharumpore
and
umballah
was
infested
by
a
gang
of
thieves
several
officers
had
been
stopped
robbed
and
plundered
of
their
money
and
valuables
i
had
been
invited
to
lahore
to
witness
the
installation
of
sir
walter
gilbert
and
sir
henry
elliot
as
knights
commanders
of
the
bath
the
danger
near
a
place
called
juggadree
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
a
mail
contractor
who
finding
me
determined
to
proceed
recommended
me
to
dress
as
a
lady
for
a
couple
of
stages
i
did
so
i
borrowed
a
gown
a
shawl
and
a
nightcap
and
when
i
came
near
the
dangerous
locality
i
put
them
on
and
commanded
the
bearers
to
say
i
was
a
in
the
event
of
the
palkee
being
stopped
sure
enough
the
palkee
was
stopped
near
juggadree
by
a
gang
of
ten
or
twelve
armed
men
one
of
whom
opened
the
door
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
truth
of
the
statement
made
by
the
bearers
the
moment
the
ruffian
saw
my
nightcap
a
very
one
it
was
lent
to
me
by
a
very
pretty
woman
likewise
a
small
bolster
which
beneath
my
shawl
represented
a
sleeping
baby
he
closed
the
door
and
requested
the
bearers
to
take
up
the
palkee
and
proceed
ay
and
what
was
more
he
enjoined
them
to
be
careful
of
the
i
have
incidentally
spoken
of
the
installation
of
sir
walter
gilbert
and
sir
henry
elliot
in
december
eighteen
hundred
and
eight
years
have
not
yet
elapsed
and
how
many
of
the
principal
characters
in
that
magnificent
spectacle
have
departed
hence
sir
walter
is
dead
sir
henry
is
dead
sir
charles
napier
and
sir
dudley
hill
who
led
them
up
to
lord
dalhousie
are
dead
colonel
mountain
who
carried
the
cushion
on
which
was
placed
the
insignia
of
the
order
is
dead
and
sir
henry
lawrence
is
dead
and
poor
stuart
beatson
alas
how
many
of
that
gay
throng
men
and
women
husbands
fathers
wives
and
daughters
who
had
assembled
to
witness
the
ceremony
have
perished
during
the
recent
revolt
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
those
who
were
present
on
that
sixth
of
december
eighteen
hundred
and
and
who
in
eighteen
hundred
and
quietly
reflect
on
what
has
occurred
since
will
scarcely
believe
in
their
own
existence
it
must
appear
to
them
as
it
often
appears
to
me
as
a
dream
a
dream
in
which
we
saw
sir
charles
napier
with
his
spare
form
his
eagle
eyes
his
aquiline
nose
and
long
grey
beard
joking
sir
dudley
hill
on
his
corpulence
and
baldness
and
asking
him
what
sort
of
figure
he
would
cut
now
in
leading
a
forlorn
hope
and
sir
dudley
proudly
and
loudly
replying
that
he
felt
a
better
man
than
ever
presently
a
meek
civilian
in
a
white
neckcloth
and
ignorant
of
sir
dudley
early
deeds
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
put
the
question
you
ever
lead
a
forlorn
hope
sir
dudley
a
query
which
induced
sir
dudley
hill
to
groan
previously
to
exclaiming
such
is
fame
a
forlorn
hope
my
dear
sir
i
have
led
fifty
this
was
of
course
an
exaggeration
but
i
believe
that
sir
dudley
hill
had
in
the
peninsular
war
led
more
forlorn
hopes
than
any
other
officer
in
the
british
army
i
have
wandered
away
from
the
high
road
to
agra
and
must
return
to
it
i
parted
with
the
ensign
at
bewah
and
commenced
reading
the
books
which
the
then
unknown
lady
had
entrusted
to
my
care
the
day
towards
noon
became
hot
damp
and
extremely
oppressive
and
there
was
no
d√¢k
bungalow
or
other
abode
within
nine
miles
of
me
before
long
i
heard
thunder
in
the
distance
and
presently
the
bearers
communicated
to
me
that
a
heavy
storm
was
approaching
and
that
in
order
to
escape
its
fury
they
wished
to
halt
at
a
village
just
of
us
i
consented
and
was
now
hurried
along
the
road
at
the
rate
of
five
miles
an
hour
my
palkee
was
placed
beneath
a
shed
and
the
bearers
congregated
around
it
one
of
the
number
lighted
his
pipe
and
passed
it
to
his
neighbour
who
after
three
whiffs
passed
it
to
the
next
who
after
three
whiffs
sent
it
on
until
each
had
partaken
of
the
smoke
the
little
village
which
was
a
short
distance
from
the
road
contained
about
sixty
or
seventy
inhabitants
and
about
double
that
number
of
children
of
various
ages
my
presence
excited
no
small
degree
of
curiosity
and
the
whole
of
the
villagers
approached
the
shed
to
have
a
look
at
me
the
men
and
women
of
course
were
not
alarmed
and
looked
on
simply
with
that
stupidity
which
is
characteristic
of
the
cultivators
of
the
soil
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
but
it
was
otherwise
with
the
more
youthful
the
children
they
held
aloof
and
peeped
from
behind
their
parents
as
if
i
had
been
some
dangerous
wild
animal
my
bearers
wished
to
drive
them
all
away
but
i
forbade
this
partly
because
i
had
no
desire
to
deprive
the
villagers
of
whatever
pleasure
a
long
inspection
of
me
might
afford
them
and
partly
because
i
wished
to
sketch
the
group
and
listen
to
their
remarks
which
were
chiefly
of
a
personal
character
and
for
the
most
part
complimentary
or
intended
so
to
be
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
and
an
awfully
loud
clap
of
thunder
accompanied
by
a
few
large
drops
of
rain
speedily
dispersed
the
crowd
and
i
was
left
to
myself
and
my
bearers
who
now
huddled
themselves
together
for
warmth
sake
the
air
had
become
chilly
and
even
i
was
compelled
to
wrap
my
cloak
and
my
blanket
about
my
limbs
another
vivid
flash
of
lightning
and
another
awful
clap
of
thunder
then
down
came
such
hailstones
as
i
had
never
seen
before
and
have
never
seen
since
in
the
plains
of
hindostan
in
size
and
weight
they
equalled
those
which
sometimes
fall
in
the
himalaya
mountains
in
june
and
july
with
these
storms
the
rains
usually
break
up
and
then
the
cold
weather
sets
in
and
with
this
season
of
the
year
what
climate
in
the
world
is
superior
to
that
of
the
upper
provinces
of
india
when
the
thunder
lightning
and
hail
had
ceased
and
their
continuance
did
not
exceed
fifteen
minutes
the
sun
came
out
and
the
face
of
heaven
was
as
fair
as
possible
but
the
earth
gave
evidence
of
the
severity
of
the
storm
not
only
was
the
ground
covered
with
leaves
and
small
branches
intermingled
with
the
hail
but
cattle
and
goats
had
been
killed
by
the
furious
pelting
of
the
huge
stones
whilst
the
electric
fluid
had
descended
on
one
of
the
mud
huts
of
the
village
in
which
i
had
taken
refuge
and
had
stretched
out
in
death
an
old
man
and
two
of
his
grandchildren
a
boy
of
six
years
of
age
and
a
girl
of
four
the
parents
of
these
children
were
absent
from
the
village
and
were
not
expected
to
return
until
the
evening
on
being
informed
of
the
accident
i
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
bodies
and
was
conducted
by
several
of
the
villagers
to
the
hut
in
which
they
were
lying
i
recognised
at
once
the
features
of
the
old
man
who
was
a
prominent
figure
in
my
sketch
and
of
one
of
the
children
the
little
girl
who
held
the
old
man
so
tightly
by
the
hand
while
she
peeped
at
me
the
face
of
the
boy
had
not
struck
me
there
they
were
lying
dead
but
still
warm
and
their
limbs
as
yet
devoid
of
rigidity
the
way
in
which
the
natives
of
india
regard
the
death
of
their
relations
or
friends
is
something
wonderful
to
behold
it
is
not
that
their
affections
are
less
strong
than
ours
or
their
feelings
less
acute
it
is
that
fatality
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
their
creed
they
are
taught
from
their
childhood
to
regard
visitations
of
this
character
as
direct
and
special
acts
of
god
as
matters
which
it
is
not
only
futile
but
improper
to
bewail
none
of
the
villagers
men
women
or
children
exhibited
any
token
of
grief
while
gazing
on
the
lifeless
bodies
they
surrounded
and
on
asking
my
bearers
whether
the
parents
of
the
children
would
weep
when
they
returned
and
found
their
offspring
thus
suddenly
cut
off
they
replied
rather
abruptly
why
should
they
weep
at
god
will
as
i
was
preparing
to
leave
the
village
a
woman
came
up
to
me
and
said
sahib
the
parents
of
the
dead
children
are
very
poor
and
the
expense
of
burning
their
remains
will
press
very
hard
upon
them
the
wood
for
the
old
man
will
cost
eight
annas
and
the
fuel
for
each
of
the
children
four
annas
in
all
one
rupee
i
placed
the
coin
in
the
woman
hand
and
left
besides
a
donation
for
the
bereaved
parents
who
were
absent
having
previously
called
several
of
the
villagers
to
witness
the
proceeding
this
i
did
at
the
suggestion
of
the
palkee
bearers
who
entertained
some
doubts
of
the
woman
honesty
we
had
not
proceeded
far
when
i
descried
a
small
encampment
beneath
a
clump
of
mango
trees
it
consisted
of
an
tent
and
two
long
tents
for
native
soldiers
sepoys
one
of
these
long
tents
was
for
the
hindoos
the
other
for
the
mussulmans
when
we
came
opposite
to
the
encampment
i
desired
the
bearers
to
stop
and
to
put
some
questions
to
a
sepoy
who
was
standing
near
the
road
i
gleaned
from
him
that
the
encampment
was
that
of
a
treasure
party
consisting
of
a
lieutenant
and
a
company
of
native
infantry
proceeding
from
mynpoorie
to
agra
wo
you
go
and
see
the
sahib
asked
the
sepoy
i
do
know
him
said
i
that
does
not
signify
said
the
sepoy
our
sahib
is
glad
to
see
everybody
he
is
the
most
man
in
hindostan
his
lips
are
the
home
of
laughter
and
his
presence
awakens
happiness
in
the
breast
of
the
most
sorrowful
his
body
is
small
but
his
mind
is
great
and
in
his
eyes
the
hindoo
the
mussulman
and
the
christian
are
all
equal
this
description
i
confess
aroused
my
curiosity
to
see
so
philosophical
a
lieutenant
and
it
was
not
long
before
my
curiosity
was
gratified
for
he
made
his
appearance
at
the
door
of
his
tent
and
observing
my
palkee
bore
down
upon
it
the
lieutenant
wore
a
pair
of
white
pyjamahs
which
were
tucked
up
to
his
knees
no
shoes
or
stockings
a
blue
shirt
no
coat
no
jacket
a
black
necktie
and
a
leather
helmet
with
a
white
covering
such
as
one
sees
labelled
in
the
for
india
his
person
was
very
small
certainly
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
not
bigger
than
those
of
a
boy
of
twelve
years
of
age
in
his
mouth
he
had
a
huge
number
one
cheroot
and
in
his
hand
a
with
a
waist
nearly
as
big
as
his
own
resting
his
chest
upon
this
and
looking
me
full
in
the
face
perfectly
ignorant
and
seemingly
indifferent
as
to
whether
i
might
be
a
secretary
to
the
government
or
a
shopkeeper
he
thus
familiarly
accosted
me
well
old
boy
how
do
you
feel
after
the
shower
very
well
i
thank
you
come
in
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
round
of
toast
if
you
are
not
in
a
hurry
to
get
on
it
will
set
you
up
and
make
you
feel
comfortable
for
the
night
this
offer
was
so
tempting
and
so
cordially
made
that
i
was
induced
to
accept
it
bring
the
sahib
into
my
tent
in
the
palkee
said
lieutenant
sixtie
to
my
bearers
and
then
addressing
me
he
remarked
do
get
out
you
wet
your
slippers
the
bearers
followed
the
lieutenant
and
put
down
my
palkee
upon
two
tiers
of
small
boxes
which
were
spread
over
the
space
of
ground
covered
by
the
tent
i
was
obliged
to
resort
to
this
box
dodge
said
my
host
or
i
should
have
been
drowned
i
wish
i
owned
only
a
quarter
of
this
rhino
we
are
treading
on
if
i
did
catch
me
at
this
work
any
longer
my
masters
it
was
the
treasure
that
the
boxes
contained
in
all
about
thousand
pounds
look
here
old
boy
forego
like
a
good
fellow
the
tea
and
the
toast
my
servants
will
have
such
a
bother
to
get
a
fire
and
boil
water
have
some
biscuits
and
cold
instead
you
should
never
drink
tea
while
travelling
it
keeps
you
awake
and
what
is
more
it
spoils
the
flavour
of
your
cheroots
by
the
bye
have
one
of
these
weeds
i
thanked
my
host
and
without
any
sort
of
pressing
yielded
to
his
every
wish
even
unto
playing
with
him
while
smoking
his
cheroots
and
drinking
his
the
stakes
were
not
very
high
only
a
rupee
a
game
during
the
deals
my
host
would
frequently
exclaim
by
jove
what
a
godsend
it
is
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
for
a
few
hours
i
have
been
out
for
five
days
and
during
that
time
have
not
uttered
a
word
in
my
own
language
have
had
the
luck
to
come
across
a
soul
this
escorting
treasure
is
the
most
awful
part
of
an
duty
especially
at
this
season
of
the
year
but
it
must
be
done
i
suggested
yes
but
why
not
by
native
officers
would
the
treasure
be
safe
with
them
safe
just
as
safe
as
it
is
now
if
not
safer
for
although
i
am
responsible
for
the
money
in
these
boxes
i
do
know
that
the
whole
amount
is
here
i
did
count
it
and
if
there
was
any
deficiency
i
should
say
so
now
a
native
officer
would
satisfy
himself
on
the
subject
before
he
took
charge
do
you
see
here
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
havildar
native
sergeant
who
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
tent
saluted
the
lieutenant
and
uttered
in
a
deep
and
solemn
tone
of
voice
the
word
well
what
the
matter
said
the
lieutenant
maun
singh
sipahee
is
very
what
ails
him
he
has
fever
then
i
will
come
and
see
him
in
one
moment
with
these
words
the
lieutenant
threw
down
his
cards
and
invited
me
to
accompany
him
to
the
tent
wherein
the
patient
was
lying
maun
singh
sipahee
was
a
powerful
brahmin
who
stood
upwards
of
six
feet
two
he
was
a
native
of
oude
and
had
a
very
dark
skin
when
we
entered
the
tent
he
attempted
to
rise
from
the
charpai
native
bedstead
on
which
he
was
reclining
but
the
lieutenant
told
him
to
be
still
then
felt
the
sick
man
pulse
and
placed
his
small
white
hand
across
the
broad
black
forehead
of
the
soldier
carry
him
into
my
tent
the
ground
is
too
damp
for
him
here
said
the
lieutenant
and
forthwith
the
bedstead
was
raised
by
of
the
man
comrades
in
the
tent
medicine
was
administered
a
small
quantity
of
tartar
emetic
dissolved
in
water
and
given
in
very
small
doses
until
nausea
was
produced
and
a
gentle
perspiration
stood
upon
the
skin
of
the
patient
you
are
all
right
now
maun
singh
said
the
lieutenant
no
sahib
i
am
dying
nothing
can
save
me
then
you
know
better
than
i
do
forgive
me
sahib
listen
lie
very
quiet
and
before
we
march
i
will
give
you
another
sort
of
medicine
that
will
set
you
up
the
sepoy
covered
his
head
over
with
his
resaiee
counterpane
and
lay
as
still
as
possible
they
always
fancy
they
are
going
to
die
if
there
is
anything
the
matter
with
them
said
the
lieutenant
to
me
i
have
cured
hundreds
of
fever
cases
by
this
treatment
the
only
medicines
i
ever
use
in
fever
sir
are
tartar
emetic
and
quinine
he
has
taken
the
one
which
has
had
its
effect
the
other
he
shall
have
by
and
bye
i
would
lose
that
man
on
any
account
his
death
would
occasion
me
the
greatest
grief
is
he
a
great
favourite
i
asked
not
more
than
any
of
the
rest
of
them
who
were
with
the
regiment
at
affghanistan
where
they
not
only
proved
themselves
as
brave
as
the
european
soldiers
but
where
they
showed
themselves
superior
to
prejudices
most
intimately
connected
with
their
religion
their
caste
that
man
whom
you
see
lying
there
is
a
brahmin
of
the
highest
caste
yet
i
have
seen
him
and
other
brahmins
now
in
my
regiment
bearing
upon
their
shoulders
the
remains
of
an
officer
to
the
grave
of
course
you
are
aware
that
to
do
a
thing
of
that
kind
to
touch
the
corpse
of
an
unbeliever
involves
a
loss
of
caste
yes
well
sir
these
fellows
braved
the
opinion
and
the
taunts
of
every
hindoo
in
the
country
in
order
to
pay
respect
to
the
memory
of
those
officers
whose
dangers
and
privations
they
had
cheerfully
shared
you
are
aware
perhaps
that
at
last
the
government
found
it
necessary
to
issue
a
general
order
to
the
effect
that
any
sepoy
of
any
other
regiment
who
insulted
the
men
of
this
regiment
by
telling
them
they
had
lost
their
caste
would
be
severely
punished
and
dismissed
the
service
such
was
the
case
sir
and
many
were
held
in
various
stations
for
the
trial
of
offenders
against
this
order
and
many
hindoo
sepoys
and
mussulman
native
officers
were
very
severely
dealt
with
and
the
thing
was
put
down
sir
and
there
is
nothing
more
common
than
for
the
hindoo
sepoys
in
all
the
regiments
to
ask
permission
to
carry
the
remains
of
a
popular
officer
to
the
grave
indeed
ladies
are
often
thus
honoured
and
children
they
seem
to
have
agreed
amongst
themselves
that
this
does
not
involve
a
loss
of
caste
so
much
for
caste
if
it
can
be
got
over
by
an
understanding
amongst
themselves
caste
more
than
of
what
they
talk
about
it
is
pure
nonsense
and
falsehood
as
any
straightforward
native
will
confidentially
confess
to
you
i
do
mean
to
say
that
some
hindoos
are
not
very
strict
many
indeed
are
so
but
i
mean
to
say
that
a
very
small
proportion
live
in
accordance
with
the
shasters
and
that
when
they
cry
out
if
we
do
so
and
so
we
shall
lose
our
caste
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
rotten
pretext
for
escaping
some
duty
or
for
refusing
to
obey
a
distasteful
order
there
are
hypocrites
in
all
countries
but
india
swarms
with
them
more
thickly
than
any
country
in
the
world
and
the
fact
is
that
we
foster
hypocrisy
our
fellows
and
most
of
them
brahmins
released
a
good
many
cats
from
the
bag
when
they
were
taunted
with
having
lost
their
caste
if
you
are
not
in
a
frightful
hurry
to
get
on
stay
till
we
march
and
go
with
us
and
tell
you
and
show
you
something
more
about
caste
you
can
send
on
your
palkee
and
bearers
to
the
next
encampment
ground
and
i
drive
you
in
my
old
trap
of
a
buggy
it
is
not
a
remarkably
elegant
affair
but
it
is
very
strong
and
roomy
by
the
bye
we
shall
have
to
travel
in
a
gig
for
i
must
put
maun
singh
my
sick
sepoy
between
us
and
you
will
find
him
a
very
intelligent
fellow
i
can
tell
you
and
the
dose
i
intend
giving
him
will
make
him
as
chirpy
as
possible
the
conversation
and
the
manners
of
the
lieutenant
free
and
easy
as
were
the
latter
had
fascinated
me
and
i
accepted
his
invitation
marching
the
small
but
heavy
boxes
containing
the
rupees
were
placed
upon
the
hackeries
native
carts
and
the
treasure
party
was
now
ready
to
march
to
the
next
encampment
the
night
was
warm
and
the
sepoys
in
what
might
strictly
be
termed
they
wore
their
red
cloth
coats
and
their
chacos
but
their
lower
clothing
was
purely
native
a
dhotee
narrow
strip
of
thick
calico
wound
round
their
loins
and
falling
in
graceful
folds
about
and
below
the
knees
some
sat
upon
the
boxes
of
treasure
others
not
in
line
or
military
order
walked
by
the
side
thereof
the
lieutenant
maun
singh
and
myself
brought
up
the
rear
a
syce
native
groom
led
the
horse
and
thus
saved
the
lieutenant
the
trouble
of
driving
the
buggy
was
not
certainly
a
very
elegant
affair
it
was
of
very
ancient
construction
and
the
lining
was
entirely
worn
out
nor
had
the
panels
been
painted
for
some
years
the
lieutenant
told
me
that
he
had
bought
this
vehicle
at
a
sale
five
years
previously
for
the
sum
of
five
pounds
and
that
since
that
time
it
had
travelled
marched
was
the
word
he
used
all
over
bengal
the
harness
was
of
cawnpore
make
and
when
new
had
cost
only
two
pounds
ten
shillings
cawnpore
until
recently
was
chiefly
famous
for
its
harness
boots
and
shoes
helmets
and
other
articles
made
of
leather
a
nest
of
chinese
settled
in
the
bazaar
many
years
ago
and
introduced
the
manufacture
of
such
matters
the
horse
which
drew
the
buggy
had
been
a
caster
that
is
to
say
a
horse
considered
no
longer
fit
for
the
cavalry
or
horse
artillery
and
sold
by
public
auction
after
being
branded
with
the
letter
r
signifying
rejected
on
the
near
shoulder
he
was
a
tall
animal
and
according
to
the
lieutenant
account
had
won
no
end
of
races
since
the
day
he
had
been
knocked
down
to
the
lieutenant
for
sixteen
rupees
or
one
pound
twelve
shillings
the
fault
or
rather
the
misfortune
for
which
this
animal
had
been
dismissed
the
company
service
was
total
blindness
of
one
eye
and
an
inability
to
see
much
out
of
the
other
but
he
is
a
ripper
nevertheless
said
the
lieutenant
touching
the
animal
very
gently
with
the
whip
and
making
him
hold
his
head
up
and
will
put
some
more
money
in
my
pocket
next
cold
weather
i
hope
he
is
entered
for
the
merchant
plate
gentlemen
riders
sir
and
i
am
his
jockey
i
expressed
a
hope
that
he
would
be
successful
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
slow
as
was
the
pace
at
which
we
proceeded
i
never
so
much
enjoyed
a
ride
in
my
life
the
scene
altogether
was
highly
picturesque
and
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
had
the
wonderful
charm
of
novelty
while
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
extremely
entertained
by
the
volubility
and
lightheartedness
of
my
military
friend
who
notwithstanding
he
had
extracted
from
me
that
i
did
not
belong
to
the
civil
service
or
the
army
had
refrained
from
inquiring
my
name
or
pursuit
and
invariably
addressed
me
as
old
boy
albeit
my
years
were
certainly
not
in
excess
of
his
own
well
maun
singh
cried
the
lieutenant
how
do
you
feel
now
quite
well
but
very
weak
was
the
sepoy
reply
then
you
must
have
a
little
drop
of
weak
hold
hard
syce
and
give
me
the
suraiee
the
was
mixed
in
a
silver
tumbler
and
handed
to
maun
singh
who
soon
as
the
groom
went
again
to
the
applied
it
to
his
lips
and
drank
without
any
scruple
on
the
contrary
it
struck
me
that
he
liked
the
liquor
you
have
lost
your
caste
said
the
lieutenant
jocularly
you
ought
to
have
drunk
it
you
know
as
medicine
out
of
your
own
lota
brass
vessel
this
observation
made
with
a
view
to
draw
the
sepoy
out
for
my
edification
had
its
effect
it
was
thus
maun
singh
discoursed
while
the
lieutenant
and
myself
smoked
our
cheroots
on
either
side
of
him
the
sahib
logue
believe
everything
that
the
natives
tell
them
about
caste
and
the
consequence
is
they
believe
a
great
many
falsehoods
if
i
could
lose
my
caste
by
drinking
medicine
out
of
this
tumbler
i
would
lose
it
by
drinking
it
out
of
my
own
cup
because
it
came
out
of
a
bottle
which
you
have
handled
and
perhaps
some
drops
of
it
touched
your
fingers
while
you
were
pouring
it
from
one
vessel
to
the
other
empty
a
bottle
of
brandy
or
gin
into
your
chillumchee
brass
basin
and
tell
one
of
your
to
throw
it
away
he
and
his
companions
will
drink
it
but
not
in
your
presence
ask
the
same
man
to
drink
the
liquor
from
your
tumbler
he
will
put
his
hands
together
and
implore
you
to
excuse
him
as
he
would
lose
his
caste
but
is
it
not
forbidden
in
the
shasters
said
i
there
is
no
mention
of
brandy
in
the
shasters
sahib
returned
maun
singh
with
some
humour
the
shasters
are
silent
on
the
subject
but
supposing
that
it
were
forbidden
do
not
men
of
every
religion
frequently
and
continually
depart
from
the
tenets
thereof
in
minor
things
or
construe
them
according
to
their
own
inclination
or
convenience
or
make
some
sort
of
bundobust
agreement
with
their
consciences
indeed
if
we
did
not
make
this
bundobust
what
hindoo
or
mussulman
would
come
in
contact
at
all
with
one
another
or
with
christians
and
certainly
we
the
natives
of
india
would
not
serve
as
soldiers
how
so
because
we
should
be
in
continual
dread
of
having
our
bodies
contaminated
and
our
souls
placed
beyond
the
reach
of
redemption
and
who
would
submit
to
that
for
so
many
rupees
who
can
say
what
animal
supplies
the
skin
which
is
used
for
our
chacos
and
accoutrements
the
cow
or
the
pig
the
mussulmans
when
we
laugh
together
about
it
say
the
cow
we
protest
that
it
is
pigskin
and
how
do
you
usually
settle
these
disputes
i
inquired
with
an
eagerness
which
seemed
to
amuse
the
sepoy
o
sahib
he
replied
it
would
be
a
pity
to
settle
any
dispute
of
that
kind
since
it
always
affords
us
some
merriment
on
a
long
march
when
pertab
singh
came
down
to
barruckpore
to
corrupt
the
regiments
of
native
infantry
there
stationed
in
eighteen
hundred
and
he
wanted
them
to
protest
against
wearing
the
chacos
and
how
was
he
received
i
inquired
they
listened
to
him
as
long
as
his
money
lasted
and
then
made
known
to
their
officers
what
he
was
about
and
who
was
pertab
singh
a
relation
of
the
ranee
of
lahore
and
had
he
money
yes
and
distributed
freely
here
the
lieutenant
informed
me
of
the
particulars
relating
to
the
mission
of
pertab
singh
which
was
simply
to
excite
the
native
troops
to
mutiny
and
to
kill
their
officers
but
the
plot
was
happily
discovered
by
the
information
given
by
the
sepoys
of
the
grenadiers
there
was
an
investigation
but
the
government
deemed
it
best
to
treat
the
whole
affair
as
a
farce
and
pertab
singh
was
looked
upon
as
a
fool
and
a
madman
and
eventually
set
at
liberty
it
was
said
that
the
sepoys
who
gave
the
information
were
to
receive
an
order
of
merit
they
had
no
reward
at
all
however
beyond
some
expressions
of
praise
from
the
authorities
suddenly
the
treasure
party
halted
and
all
the
sepoys
were
speedily
congregated
beneath
a
mango
tree
what
is
the
matter
cried
the
lieutenant
adjutant
bargow
sahib
grave
said
maun
singh
do
you
not
remember
the
spot
i
did
not
in
this
light
said
the
lieutenant
alighting
from
the
buggy
followed
by
myself
and
maun
singh
yes
here
he
rests
poor
fellow
one
of
the
best
and
bravest
beings
that
ever
breathed
he
died
suddenly
one
morning
when
we
were
encamped
here
he
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
men
as
you
may
judge
from
the
respect
paid
by
those
now
present
to
the
spot
where
his
ashes
repose
one
of
the
sepoys
suddenly
began
to
call
down
curses
on
the
head
of
some
sacrilegious
thief
he
had
discovered
that
the
piece
of
marble
which
had
been
let
into
the
head
of
the
chunam
plaster
tomb
and
on
which
was
cut
the
name
age
and
regiment
of
the
deceased
had
been
abstracted
ah
that
of
course
said
the
lieutenant
it
is
always
the
case
they
steal
the
bit
of
marble
to
make
a
currystone
a
stone
on
which
they
grind
the
ingredients
for
a
curry
it
was
not
worth
more
than
a
shilling
intrinsically
but
if
it
had
only
been
worth
one
anna
or
a
quarter
of
an
anna
half
a
farthing
they
would
have
carried
it
away
all
the
same
just
as
they
steal
pieces
of
iron
and
lead
from
the
stone
bridges
and
thus
do
immense
mischief
all
along
the
grand
trunk
road
you
will
find
the
stones
used
for
headstones
carried
away
from
the
graves
the
march
thirteen
miles
occupied
us
five
hours
so
slowly
did
the
bullocks
crawl
along
with
the
treasure
it
was
about
four
when
we
came
to
the
ground
the
hour
at
which
in
strictness
the
lieutenant
should
have
started
but
he
informed
me
that
when
on
separate
duty
he
took
a
good
deal
of
responsibility
on
himself
and
without
detriment
to
the
interests
of
government
suited
his
own
convenience
and
that
of
his
men
he
therefore
preferred
making
night
work
of
the
business
and
having
the
whole
day
at
his
own
disposal
send
your
bearers
away
and
spend
the
day
with
me
said
the
lighthearted
lieutenant
you
can
get
other
bearers
at
any
of
the
villages
in
the
neighbourhood
or
if
you
are
not
in
a
violent
hurry
march
the
whole
distance
to
agra
with
me
i
can
stick
your
palkee
and
boxes
on
the
top
of
the
treasure
you
know
i
accepted
the
invitation
with
pleasure
and
entered
the
tent
where
we
found
tea
and
biscuits
ready
after
partaking
of
this
refreshment
we
threw
ourselves
down
on
charpoys
native
bedsteads
and
soon
fell
fast
asleep
we
slept
till
ten
when
we
arose
had
breakfast
consisting
of
the
old
story
grilled
fowl
curried
fowl
and
eggs
with
beer
instead
of
tea
and
then
we
went
out
and
sat
under
the
mango
trees
which
formed
a
dense
shade
over
the
encampment
the
lieutenant
had
with
him
a
pellet
bow
and
was
shooting
at
the
squirrels
which
abound
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
while
he
was
thus
employed
a
sepoy
a
brahmin
called
out
sahib
you
have
no
right
to
do
that
it
is
written
in
the
general
orders
that
you
must
respect
the
religious
feelings
of
the
hindoos
and
here
are
you
wantonly
destroying
the
life
of
animals
in
our
presence
i
shall
report
this
to
the
colonel
sahib
when
we
return
to
the
regiment
from
the
tone
in
which
the
sepoy
spoke
i
thought
he
was
in
earnest
the
lieutenant
however
assured
me
that
he
was
only
ridiculing
one
of
those
absurd
general
orders
which
frequently
appear
but
of
which
bad
and
discontented
sepoys
often
take
advantage
ere
long
this
brahmin
observing
that
the
light
of
the
lieutenant
cheroot
was
extinguished
brought
him
some
fire
the
lieutenant
gravely
shook
his
head
and
said
no
it
is
written
in
general
orders
that
no
officer
shall
employ
for
his
own
purposes
a
sepoy
who
is
a
soldier
and
not
a
servant
and
that
any
officer
so
offending
will
subject
himself
to
be
tried
by
a
court
martial
then
taking
the
fire
from
the
hand
of
the
brahmin
he
remarked
to
me
the
consequence
of
that
order
for
which
there
never
was
the
slightest
occasion
is
simply
this
those
men
who
are
willing
to
oblige
their
officers
laugh
at
it
while
the
disaffected
will
insolently
quote
it
if
required
only
to
pick
up
a
glove
or
a
many
an
officer
has
been
severely
reprimanded
for
asking
a
sepoy
to
carry
a
letter
for
him
to
the
post
office
it
was
a
very
pretty
scene
that
encampment
the
tents
the
arms
piled
in
front
of
them
the
horse
under
a
tree
and
his
syce
seated
near
him
the
old
buggy
and
harness
not
far
off
the
sepoys
in
groups
employed
in
cooking
their
food
for
the
meal
the
numbers
of
brass
vessels
lying
about
in
all
directions
the
score
of
squirrels
hopping
from
branch
to
branch
or
running
up
and
down
the
trunks
of
the
trees
the
crows
the
minars
and
the
sparrows
on
the
look
out
for
crumbs
the
bullocks
taking
their
rest
after
the
fatigues
of
the
past
night
and
then
before
as
well
as
after
the
meal
the
men
crowding
round
the
well
and
washing
themselves
from
head
to
foot
and
washing
also
their
under
garments
which
are
speedily
dried
in
the
sun
of
that
climate
it
is
impossible
to
witness
and
not
admire
this
part
of
the
hindoo
and
mussulman
religions
after
one
when
every
man
had
enjoyed
his
smoke
there
was
scarcely
a
soul
except
myself
and
the
lieutenant
awake
in
the
encampment
all
were
fast
asleep
in
the
open
air
the
asiatic
must
sleep
after
his
meal
if
it
be
only
for
half
an
hour
the
loss
of
this
little
sleep
is
a
very
severe
privation
at
three
the
encampment
was
again
all
life
some
of
the
sepoys
wrestled
and
exhibited
amazing
skill
and
strength
in
the
art
to
an
european
it
is
a
mystery
how
men
who
live
upon
nothing
but
farinaceous
food
can
be
so
muscular
and
powerful
others
smoked
their
pipes
small
hookahs
and
played
at
a
native
game
called
puchesee
resembling
lotto
while
a
goodly
number
congregated
around
a
mussulman
who
was
reading
aloud
the
a
hindoostanee
work
of
great
celebrity
two
or
three
of
the
company
were
musical
and
played
alternately
on
the
sitarre
native
guitar
or
violin
accompanied
by
the
native
drum
and
the
voices
of
those
who
were
disposed
and
able
to
sing
as
for
the
lieutenant
and
myself
we
beguiled
the
time
in
conversation
and
with
towards
sunset
a
palkee
d√¢k
carriage
was
reported
to
be
in
sight
coming
down
the
road
hooray
cried
the
lieutenant
come
along
let
us
board
him
i
am
in
want
of
a
few
small
matters
it
was
not
long
before
the
d√¢k
carriage
was
abreast
of
the
encampment
stop
shouted
the
lieutenant
to
the
driver
who
instantly
pulled
up
whom
have
you
got
inside
before
the
driver
had
time
to
reply
the
door
was
slided
open
and
an
elderly
gentleman
rubbing
his
eyes
with
his
knuckles
put
out
his
head
and
exclaimed
hulloa
what
have
we
woke
you
out
of
your
sleep
old
boy
said
the
lieutenant
laughing
yes
replied
the
old
boy
very
what
do
you
want
only
to
ask
you
how
you
are
i
pretty
well
was
the
reply
but
half
choked
with
the
dust
what
taking
you
down
the
country
urgent
private
affairs
going
to
be
married
i
suppose
well
you
have
just
guessed
it
make
my
most
respectful
salaam
to
your
intended
will
you
by
all
means
when
do
you
expect
to
reach
cawnpore
at
three
and
how
do
you
stand
affected
for
liquors
and
weeds
do
you
want
anything
old
boy
brandy
beer
say
the
word
nothing
i
have
more
in
the
well
here
than
i
shall
be
able
to
consume
then
i
trouble
you
for
the
surplus
for
i
am
very
short
and
can
not
get
anything
till
i
reach
agra
while
you
can
replenish
at
every
station
you
know
all
right
my
child
exclaimed
the
old
boy
and
with
the
greatest
cheerfulness
he
alighted
and
began
to
unpack
his
stores
from
these
the
lieutenant
took
six
bottles
of
beer
two
bottles
of
brandy
a
dozen
of
and
three
hundred
manilla
cheroots
this
done
the
old
boy
expressed
a
desire
to
push
on
but
the
lieutenant
detained
him
for
at
least
ten
minutes
with
a
series
of
questions
several
of
which
i
thought
were
somewhat
impertinent
for
instance
he
inquired
his
intended
name
whether
she
was
tall
short
or
of
the
middle
height
what
was
the
colour
of
her
hair
and
eyes
and
accomplished
and
to
all
these
questions
the
old
boy
responded
with
as
serious
an
air
as
if
the
lieutenant
had
a
perfect
right
to
put
them
at
last
the
old
boy
proceeded
on
his
journey
do
you
know
him
i
inquired
of
the
lieutenant
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
oh
yes
was
the
reply
he
is
a
major
commanding
a
native
infantry
regiment
at
banda
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
and
has
heaps
of
property
but
a
frightful
fool
except
in
the
way
of
and
at
that
he
is
awfully
clever
i
first
made
his
acquaintance
in
affghanistan
he
was
then
in
the
commissariat
department
and
was
only
taken
out
of
that
department
about
a
year
ago
when
he
attained
his
majority
he
knows
nothing
whatever
of
soldiering
having
been
in
staff
employ
ever
since
he
was
an
ensign
all
the
sepoys
as
well
as
his
officers
laugh
him
as
he
comes
on
the
parade
ground
and
attempts
to
handle
the
regiment
and
after
the
farce
is
over
he
laughs
them
for
thirty
years
he
was
employed
in
commissariat
duties
in
which
he
is
very
efficient
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
he
became
a
major
and
then
according
to
the
rules
of
the
service
he
was
withdrawn
from
staff
employ
and
appointed
to
command
a
corps
surely
you
are
jesting
on
my
honour
i
am
serious
that
is
a
part
of
our
military
system
sir
here
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
the
soubadhar
native
commissioned
officer
who
pronounced
in
a
deep
sonorous
but
feeble
and
inarticulate
voice
that
familiar
word
sahib
or
as
more
commonly
pronounced
sarb
well
old
man
what
is
the
matter
said
the
lieutenant
to
the
almost
imbecile
native
veteran
who
had
served
in
the
time
of
lord
lake
and
who
ought
to
have
been
pensioned
many
years
previously
despite
any
remonstrances
against
such
a
measure
the
old
man
forthwith
began
to
detail
a
string
of
grievances
which
the
lieutenant
faithfully
promised
to
see
remedied
albeit
he
could
understand
but
a
few
words
the
old
man
said
so
very
indistinct
was
his
speech
from
sheer
old
age
and
the
loss
of
his
teeth
a
grievance
real
or
imaginary
is
quite
necessary
for
that
old
man
existence
said
the
lieutenant
and
if
he
ca
find
one
for
himself
which
is
a
very
rare
circumstance
he
will
concoct
one
for
the
sepoys
to
make
grievances
is
the
end
and
object
of
that
old
life
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
he
is
a
perfect
representative
of
the
entire
body
of
native
commissioned
officers
who
are
generally
speaking
despised
by
the
men
of
the
regiment
as
well
as
by
the
european
officers
these
are
the
gentlemen
who
brew
or
ferment
all
the
mischief
that
occasionally
occurs
in
native
regiments
they
suggest
to
the
men
to
make
all
sorts
of
extortionate
demands
just
as
a
regiment
is
on
the
point
of
marching
that
old
man
present
grievance
as
far
as
i
could
collect
is
that
the
water
is
very
bad
here
at
this
encampment
ground
and
that
government
ought
to
have
a
new
well
sunk
he
happens
just
now
to
be
suffering
severely
from
one
of
the
very
many
ailments
consequent
on
his
time
of
life
and
he
attributes
it
to
the
water
which
happens
to
be
very
good
i
remarked
precisely
so
these
native
officers
of
every
rank
and
grade
are
in
my
opinion
the
curse
of
the
native
service
many
very
and
experienced
officers
have
recommended
doing
away
with
them
and
appointing
in
their
stead
more
european
officers
but
the
advice
has
never
been
heeded
and
never
will
be
i
fear
it
was
not
until
midnight
that
the
little
camp
was
broken
up
and
we
resumed
the
march
towards
agra
during
the
drive
the
lieutenant
entertained
me
by
relating
a
number
of
stories
connected
with
the
war
in
affghanistan
several
of
them
interested
me
exceedingly
one
in
particular
it
was
this
which
i
now
give
in
the
lieutenant
own
words
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
them
about
a
year
ago
said
he
i
was
passing
through
meerut
on
my
way
from
the
hills
whither
i
had
been
on
sick
certificate
and
was
putting
up
for
a
few
days
with
my
friend
richards
of
the
light
cavalry
a
man
whom
i
had
known
during
that
disastrous
campaign
to
which
this
narrative
has
reference
one
morning
after
breakfast
there
came
to
the
bungalow
of
my
friend
an
affghan
who
was
a
dealer
in
dried
fruits
such
as
grapes
apples
and
pomegranates
and
inquired
if
the
sahib
or
mem
sahib
was
in
want
of
any
of
these
commodities
which
he
had
just
brought
from
caubul
my
friend
wife
who
had
also
been
in
affghanistan
and
spoke
the
mongrel
persian
current
in
that
country
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
the
affghan
was
admitted
to
the
verandah
to
exhibit
his
specimens
and
declare
his
prices
to
talk
to
these
dealers
is
rather
amusing
at
times
especially
when
you
know
their
habits
and
customs
and
peculiarities
as
well
as
their
language
to
people
who
have
been
in
their
country
it
is
like
meeting
with
an
old
friend
and
one
lingers
as
long
as
possible
over
the
business
of
the
bargain
and
sale
and
so
was
it
this
morning
we
had
him
for
at
least
an
hour
in
the
verandah
before
my
friend
wife
would
decide
upon
what
she
would
take
this
matter
concluded
the
affghan
inquired
if
the
lady
would
buy
a
kitten
a
persian
kitten
kittens
being
also
a
commodity
with
these
travelling
affghans
where
are
the
kittens
said
the
lady
said
the
merchant
putting
his
hand
into
a
huge
pocket
at
the
back
of
his
chogah
a
sort
of
gaberdine
and
withdrawing
one
by
one
no
less
than
sixteen
of
these
little
animals
all
males
for
more
than
the
hour
which
was
consumed
in
negotiating
about
the
fruit
and
talking
on
other
subjects
this
living
bustle
had
remained
perfectly
motionless
and
had
not
uttered
a
single
sound
but
now
when
they
saw
the
light
and
were
placed
upon
they
ran
about
and
mewed
bushy
tails
on
end
after
the
most
vigorous
fashion
imaginable
there
they
were
kittens
as
black
as
the
blackest
ink
kittens
white
as
the
whitest
snow
kittens
as
yellow
as
the
yellowest
gold
and
kittens
piebald
brindled
and
grey
mem
sahib
take
your
choice
twenty
rupees
two
pounds
each
the
lady
selected
one
of
the
white
and
one
of
the
black
kittens
and
for
the
two
he
was
induced
to
accept
rupees
three
pounds
ten
shillings
this
may
seem
a
large
sum
of
money
to
give
for
a
brace
of
young
cats
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
came
from
bokhara
and
were
of
the
purest
breed
that
could
possibly
be
procured
the
affghan
dealer
took
his
leave
and
promised
to
send
the
fruits
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
fulfilled
his
promise
at
there
came
a
boy
of
about
eleven
years
of
age
bearing
the
basket
containing
them
upon
his
head
which
was
shawled
after
the
fashion
of
the
affghan
people
the
boy
was
admitted
to
the
room
no
sooner
was
he
shown
in
than
his
exceedingly
beautiful
countenance
and
its
peculiar
expression
riveted
the
attention
of
all
of
us
and
we
put
to
him
a
variety
of
questions
which
he
answered
with
great
intelligence
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
so
soft
and
silvery
that
even
the
guttural
sounds
he
uttered
came
like
music
on
the
ear
into
that
boy
face
said
the
lady
to
her
husband
and
myself
his
every
feature
and
his
teeth
regard
especially
his
smile
yes
and
even
the
shape
of
his
fingers
and
then
tell
me
of
whom
he
is
the
very
image
know
said
my
friend
do
i
exclaimed
your
humble
servant
said
the
lady
energetically
not
speak
but
let
each
of
us
write
the
name
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
see
if
we
agree
and
tearing
up
an
envelope
and
taking
a
tiny
from
her
she
wrote
a
name
upon
one
slip
and
then
handed
to
me
and
to
her
husband
respectively
a
slip
and
the
when
we
had
each
written
a
name
we
compared
them
and
they
did
not
agree
exactly
my
friend
and
his
wife
had
written
captain
percy
and
i
had
written
percy
that
the
boy
was
the
offspring
of
that
unfortunate
couple
cousins
who
perished
in
that
campaign
and
of
whose
young
child
no
one
ever
knew
what
had
become
we
were
all
quite
satisfied
and
our
reflections
became
extremely
melancholy
we
questioned
the
boy
as
to
his
parentage
his
relation
to
the
affghan
dealer
in
cats
and
fruit
and
on
a
variety
of
other
matters
his
replies
were
simply
to
the
effect
that
he
was
an
orphan
and
a
slave
that
he
knew
not
the
place
of
his
birth
but
believed
it
was
affghanistan
that
he
was
a
mahommedan
and
that
his
earliest
recollections
were
associated
with
caubul
whilst
we
were
thus
interrogating
the
boy
the
major
of
my
regiment
accompanied
by
his
wife
drove
up
to
the
door
they
had
come
to
pay
a
visit
when
asked
to
look
at
the
boy
and
say
to
whom
he
bore
a
resemblance
they
at
once
declared
percy
several
officers
of
the
regiment
were
sent
for
they
came
and
immediately
on
seeing
the
boy
expressed
an
opinion
that
he
was
the
child
of
the
unfortunate
officer
whose
name
has
been
partially
recorded
the
poor
boy
meanwhile
exhibited
some
anxiety
to
return
to
his
master
but
he
was
detained
and
further
questioned
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
was
treated
he
confessed
that
his
master
was
rather
severe
but
withal
a
very
good
man
it
was
resolved
to
summon
the
affghan
dealer
and
make
him
render
an
account
of
the
boy
and
of
how
he
became
possessed
of
him
for
this
purpose
a
messenger
was
dispatched
and
enjoined
to
make
haste
the
affghan
dealer
came
and
was
cautioned
that
he
must
speak
the
truth
whereupon
as
is
the
custom
in
india
from
one
end
to
the
other
he
declared
that
he
never
spoke
falsely
and
that
he
would
rather
have
his
tongue
torn
out
this
little
preliminary
over
the
examination
which
was
conducted
by
the
major
of
the
regiment
a
very
shrewd
and
clever
man
and
who
by
the
way
was
distantly
related
to
the
unfortunate
couple
to
whom
the
boy
bore
such
a
strong
resemblance
commenced
is
this
boy
belongs
to
me
son

ago

us
all
you
know
about
this
boy
have
answered
all
the
sahib
questions
will
the
sahib
answer
a
few
of
mine
you
believe
this
boy
to
be
of
european
birth
you
think
you
know
who
were
his
parents
they
people
of
a
distinguished
family
this
question
was
answered
rather
proudly
pure
blood
is
the
sahib
certain
that
this
boy
is
the
child
of
certain
parents
will
the
sahib
take
him
here
the
poor
boy
placed
his
hands
together
and
supplicated
the
major
to
let
him
remain
where
he
then
was
in
the
service
of
the
affghan
dealer
heedless
of
this
interruption
which
was
soon
silenced
the
examination
or
rather
the
conversation
as
it
now
became
was
continued
will
you
give
for
him
do
you
ask
must
speak
sahib
hundred
rupees
cost
me
nearly
that
when
he
was
very
young
and
sickly
two
hundred
rupees
sahib
half
a
lac
of
rupees
would
not
purchase
him
my
good
man
slavery
is
not
permitted
in
the
british
dominions
and
we
will
detain
the
boy
his
will
suspicion
that
he
is
born
of
european
parents
of
distinction
i
will
give
the
boy
his
liberty
and
if
he
then
wishes
to
follow
me
and
you
detain
him
he
is
your
prisoner
instead
of
my
slave
here
the
boy
again
entreated
the
major
to
spare
him
mind
that
suppose
that
i
could
prove
to
you
that
he
is
the
child
of
a
sergeant
of
the
queen
regiment
of
foot
and
of
his
wife
what
then
would
you
take
the
boy
would
you
shall
have
the
boy
many
of
your
questions
i
answered
falsely
on
purpose
the
true
history
of
the
child
i
will
recount
to
you
and
produce
such
proofs
as
i
have
in
my
possession
i
vowed
to
god
and
to
the
prophet
that
i
would
never
sell
the
child
and
i
have
kept
my
word
it
will
be
a
bitter
grief
to
me
to
part
with
him
but
for
his
own
sake
i
will
endure
it
ooddeen
was
my
elder
brother
he
kept
a
shop
in
the
bazaar
at
caubul
this
child
was
brought
to
him
by
a
woman
of
hindostan
who
not
only
deposited
with
him
the
child
but
a
sum
of
money
in
gold
mohurs
and
rupees
likewise
a
quantity
of
english
jewellery
and
her
own
gold
and
silver
bangles
she
represented
to
my
brother
that
the
parents
had
been
killed
and
that
she
was
afraid
every
european
in
affghanistan
would
share
their
fate
my
brother
knew
the
woman
that
is
to
say
she
had
been
a
customer
at
his
shop
and
had
purchased
from
him
sundry
articles
of
warm
clothing
for
her
employers
and
herself
after
leaving
the
child
and
the
money
and
the
jewellery
in
all
to
the
value
of
about
four
thousand
rupees
she
went
her
way
and
never
returned
it
is
most
likely
that
she
died
suddenly
of
cold
like
very
many
of
the
native
servants
of
hindostan
both
male
and
female
the
frost
settled
about
their
hearts
and
they
slept
their
lives
away
or
if
they
escaped
death
they
lost
their
toes
fingers
ears
or
noses
the
british
army
was
victorious
and
affairs
were
in
a
somewhat
settled
state
my
brother
was
most
anxious
to
deliver
up
the
child
the
money
and
the
jewels
to
the
british
authorities
but
a
number
of
his
friends
dissuaded
him
from
so
doing
on
the
ground
that
the
bare
possession
of
the
child
would
place
my
brother
life
in
jeopardy
by
inducing
a
conclusion
that
he
was
the
affrighted
accomplice
of
murderers
assassins
and
thieves
i
confess
that
i
was
one
who
entertained
this
opinion
and
i
shook
my
head
whenever
my
brother
repeated
his
desire
four
or
five
years
ago
my
brother
died
and
i
a
wandering
dealer
became
the
guardian
of
this
boy
for
whom
i
have
a
great
affection
and
the
holder
of
his
money
for
which
i
care
not
and
which
i
have
no
desire
to
retain
he
has
travelled
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
with
me
he
has
been
to
bokhara
to
cashmere
all
over
the
punjab
to
mooltan
scinde
all
through
the
provinces
down
to
calcutta
to
simlah
mussooree
wherever
the
english
have
settled
themselves
in
india
and
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
expose
him
in
a
quiet
way
to
the
gaze
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
hope
that
some
day
he
would
be
recognised
and
restored
to
his
proper
position
in
life
never
until
now
has
any
one
been
struck
with
his
countenance
beyond
casually
remarking
to
me
that
he
was
a
very
pretty
boy
certainly
no
one
ever
seemed
to
have
the
slightest
idea
that
he
was
born
of
european
parents
and
is
a
christian
for
he
is
not
a
mussulman
though
he
thinks
he
is
a
mussulman
and
says
his
prayers
and
is
very
constant
to
all
the
observances
of
the
mussulman
faith
gentleman
i
am
a
wandering
dealer
from
affghanistan
but
i
am
not
destitute
of
good
feeling
and
integrity
little
as
you
may
credit
my
assertions
in
this
respect
give
me
a
proof
that
you
know
who
were
the
child
parents
and
i
am
willing
to
restore
him
and
all
that
rightfully
belongs
to
him
to
your
custody
are
you
not
satisfied
with
my
word
never
mind
the
money
and
the
jewels
much
as
i
should
like
to
see
the
latter
all
i
require
is
the
boy
said
the
major
course
the
sahib
would
not
speak
an
untruth
knowingly
returned
the
affghan
i
require
some
proof
that
the
boy
is
the
child
of
certain
european
parents
there
is
the
likeness
the
unmistakeable
likeness
that
he
bears
to
his
father
and
his
mother
will
not
do
said
the
affghan
interrupting
the
major
you
write
in
the
persian
character
sahib
write
the
name
of
this
boy
father
in
the
persian
character
and
let
me
see
it
the
major
did
this
and
handed
it
to
the
affghan
who
looked
at
the
writing
smiled
and
said
else
what
was
the
sahib
nishan
crest
said
the
major
holding
out
the
little
finger
of
his
right
hand
upon
which
was
a
was
his
nishan
we
are
of
the
same
family
and
the
nishan
is
the
same
the
affghan
having
examined
the
crest
again
smiled
and
said
else
more
do
you
want
said
the
major
not
be
impatient
sahib
said
the
affghan
identification
of
a
child
who
may
be
an
heir
to
property
is
not
so
light
a
matter
as
the
purchase
of
a
kitten
did
you
know
the
child
mother
said
the
major
was
also
a
relation
of
mine
kind
of
person
was
she
was
she
handsome
colour
of
her
eyes
almost
black
her
hair
the
colour
of
this
lady
pointing
to
the
wife
of
my
friend
you
saw
her
likeness
in
miniature
do
you
think
you
could
recognise
it
it
were
a
faithful
likeness
i
could
the
affghan
put
his
hand
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
chogah
and
produced
a
greasy
leathern
bag
into
the
mouth
of
which
he
inserted
his
finger
and
thumb
and
presently
produced
a
small
tin
box
round
and
shallow
which
he
very
carefully
opened
having
removed
some
cotton
he
handed
the
box
to
the
major
all
of
us
instantly
recognised
the
features
of
the
unfortunate
lady
who
had
perished
by
the
side
of
her
husband
in
affghanistan
who
could
possibly
forget
that
sweet
feminine
face
of
hers
which
had
been
painted
for
her
husband
by
one
of
the
most
distinguished
miniature
painters
of
the
age
the
production
of
the
likeness
in
the
presence
of
the
boy
who
appeared
to
take
little
interest
in
what
was
going
on
had
a
sad
effect
upon
the
major
he
sat
down
upon
a
chair
covered
his
manly
face
with
his
hands
and
wept
bitterly
do
you
know
this
sahib
asked
the
affghan
when
the
major
had
somewhat
recovered
his
violent
emotion
placing
in
his
hand
poor
percy
seal
we
all
recognised
the
seal
the
crest
of
which
of
course
corresponded
with
the
crest
on
the
of
the
major
this
asked
the
affghan
holding
up
a
bracelet
which
we
had
seen
percy
wear
many
and
many
a
time
this
holding
up
to
our
gaze
a
small
brooch
she
used
to
wear
constantly
and
amongst
numerous
other
things
he
exhibited
to
us
a
little
in
which
she
kept
her
memoranda
such
as
cut
the
ends
of
my
dear
little
boy
hair
sent
mamma
a
small
november
had
a
long
talk
to
the
old
ayah
who
swore
to
me
that
she
would
and
i
believe
her
for
she
has
been
a
good
and
constant
creature
to
us
in
our
dangers
and
our
difficulties
this
and
this
and
this
and
this
said
the
affghan
withdrawing
from
the
leathern
bag
its
entire
contents
every
article
of
which
was
instantly
identified
sahib
take
them
all
and
the
boy
into
your
custody
the
money
which
was
left
with
him
i
will
restore
to
you
it
is
at
present
in
the
bazaar
in
the
charge
of
my
camel
whom
no
one
dare
approach
except
myself
and
this
boy
here
a
very
extraordinary
and
painful
but
perhaps
natural
scene
occurred
the
boy
who
had
been
comparatively
passive
now
broke
out
into
a
vehement
expostulation
and
spoke
with
a
rapidity
which
was
truly
amazing
considering
that
he
distinctly
enunciated
every
syllable
to
which
he
gave
utterance
he
exclaimed
you
then
leave
me
in
the
hands
and
at
the
mercy
of
these
unbelievers
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
this
quiet
said
the
affghan
to
the
boy
in
a
gentle
tone
of
voice
can
i
be
quiet
cried
the
boy
clenching
his
fists
convulsively
and
drawing
himself
up
whilst
his
eyes
glared
and
his
nostrils
dilated
with
uncontrollable
passion
and
something
like
foam
stood
upon
his
crimson
lips
there
could
be
no
doubt
whose
child
he
was
so
wonderful
in
his
wrath
was
the
likeness
that
he
bore
to
his
father
who
was
very
seldom
provoked
to
anger
but
who
when
it
did
happen
was
in
the
extreme
in
short
a
perfect
demon
until
the
paroxysm
was
over
child
said
the
major
to
me
talk
to
him
now
sahib
said
the
affghan
compassionately
his
anger
his
senses
always
leave
him
and
he
can
not
hear
what
you
say
let
him
exhaust
his
fury
upon
me
he
will
be
powerless
presently
and
so
it
was
after
a
brief
while
the
boy
sat
down
on
the
carpet
gasped
for
breath
and
was
seemingly
unable
to
move
or
speak
the
lady
of
the
house
offered
him
a
glass
of
water
but
he
shrunk
back
and
declined
to
receive
it
from
her
hand
the
affghan
took
the
major
aside
spoke
to
him
in
private
and
then
left
the
room
here
another
very
painful
scene
ensued
the
boy
exhausted
as
he
was
attempted
to
follow
his
late
master
he
was
restrained
of
course
whereupon
he
uttered
the
most
cries
that
ever
were
heard
the
major
had
him
conveyed
to
his
bungalow
where
a
room
was
set
apart
for
him
and
a
servant
and
an
orderly
had
him
in
their
keeping
it
was
a
month
before
the
boy
could
be
reconciled
to
his
as
he
called
it
and
soon
afterwards
arrangements
were
made
for
sending
him
home
to
his
grandfather
and
grandmother
who
are
persons
of
a
lofty
position
in
life
and
very
wealthy
they
received
him
with
extreme
affection
and
on
the
death
of
his
grandfather
he
will
succeed
to
a
title
and
an
estate
worth
eleven
thousand
the
affghan
who
was
very
fond
of
the
boy
corresponds
with
him
regularly
and
they
exchange
presents
as
well
as
letters
kelly
of
the
who
was
killed
at
ferozeshah
and
who
formerly
belonged
to
the
foot
when
they
were
in
affghanistan
told
me
a
more
curious
story
of
a
little
girl
than
the
one
i
have
related
to
you
of
this
boy
what
was
it
i
asked
my
dear
fellow
said
the
lieutenant
i
can
not
talk
any
more
just
now
you
shall
have
it
some
other
day
we
are
not
going
to
part
company
yet
old
boy
with
these
words
he
fell
asleep
his
feet
over
the
dashboard
and
his
head
resting
on
my
shoulder
the
march
continued
the
next
at
which
we
halted
was
close
to
a
d√¢k
bungalow
and
during
the
day
there
were
several
arrivals
and
departures
the
travellers
merely
halting
for
an
hour
or
so
while
some
refreshment
was
got
ready
the
lieutenant
who
appeared
to
know
everybody
in
hindostan
i
never
met
a
person
who
did
not
know
him
contrived
to
use
his
own
phrase
to
screw
a
small
chat
out
of
each
of
them
on
one
occasion
he
returned
to
the
tent
richer
than
he
left
it
he
carried
in
one
hand
a
small
basket
containing
preserved
oysters
crystallized
apricots
and
captains
biscuits
and
in
the
other
a
stone
bottle
of
maraschino
under
his
arm
was
a
quantity
of
gauze
which
he
wanted
for
a
veil
he
said
these
contributions
he
had
levied
from
a
lady
who
was
going
to
muttra
where
her
husband
was
an
official
of
some
magnitude
she
had
just
returned
from
england
the
lieutenant
informed
me
and
was
looking
as
blooming
as
possible
to
my
question
do
you
know
her
he
responded
oh
yes
she
is
one
of
my
sixty
sixty
what
first
cousins
all
in
india
every
one
of
them
my
good
sir
i
have
at
this
moment
in
the
bengal
presidency
alone
upwards
of
two
hundred
and
twenty
relations
and
connexions
male
and
female
and
every
one
of
them
that
is
to
say
the
men
and
the
boys
in
the
service
of
the
government
is
it
possible
yes
what
is
more
of
the
number
are
in
the
civil
service
i
should
have
been
in
the
civil
service
too
only
i
was
sent
away
from
haileybury
for
rebellion
and
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
for
me
to
go
to
any
station
in
these
provinces
without
finding
a
cousin
in
it
do
you
know
the
of
agra
yes
is
he
a
cousin
of
yours
is
but
his
wife
father
and
my
father
were
own
brothers
so
it
amounts
to
pretty
much
the
same
thing
and
do
you
know
the
judge
of
jampore
this
was
a
gentleman
to
whom
i
had
letters
of
introduction
yes
his
mother
was
my
aunt
it
must
be
dangerous
i
suggested
to
express
an
opinion
of
any
one
in
india
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
has
so
very
many
relations
oh
dear
no
said
the
lieutenant
a
man
with
such
a
frightful
lot
of
connexions
has
no
right
to
be
and
is
not
generally
very
sensitive
bless
me
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
stand
up
for
my
relations
i
should
run
the
risk
of
being
perpetually
knocked
down
life
is
much
too
short
for
that
sort
of
thing
therefore
when
i
hear
any
one
abuse
or
reflect
upon
any
relation
or
connexion
of
mine
i
am
invariably
silent
or
if
appealed
to
express
my
indifference
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
here
we
were
interrupted
by
the
old
soubahdar
who
came
to
the
door
of
the
tent
he
had
dined
washed
smoked
slept
and
had
now
got
up
to
grumble
his
huge
which
measured
four
feet
by
two
and
two
feet
deep
and
without
which
he
never
travelled
had
received
a
slight
injury
and
of
this
he
had
come
to
complain
he
said
that
in
the
time
of
lord
clive
or
lord
lake
if
such
a
thing
had
happened
the
men
in
charge
of
the
hackeries
carts
would
have
been
hanged
on
the
spot
and
phool
singh
brahmin
whose
exertions
he
alleged
prevented
the
utter
destruction
of
the
box
would
have
been
promoted
to
the
rank
of
havildar
clive
and
lake
whispered
the
lieutenant
to
me
he
talks
like
a
leading
article
in
a
london
newspaper
then
turning
to
the
old
man
he
inquired
would
lord
clive
or
lord
lake
have
sanctioned
your
carrying
about
that
beastly
trunk
on
a
march
at
all
yes
sahib
it
is
not
true
lord
clive
and
lord
lake
gained
their
victories
by
the
help
of
men
who
cheerfully
endured
any
personal
inconvenience
not
by
a
parcel
of
old
grumblers
like
yourself
who
have
no
right
to
refer
to
the
career
of
those
illustrious
men
sahib
i
was
with
lord
lake
army
then
that
the
very
reason
that
you
ought
not
to
be
here
but
our
present
colonel
sahib
was
with
lord
lake
and
i
wish
he
was
with
lord
lake
now
i
shall
report
this
sahib
very
well
do
whereupon
the
old
officer
left
the
tent
and
the
lieutenant
assured
me
that
the
colonel
who
was
as
imbecile
as
the
soubahdar
would
cause
the
matter
to
be
investigated
and
that
he
the
lieutenant
would
to
a
certainty
receive
a
severe
reprimand
for
what
i
asked
for
not
having
made
arrangements
for
the
safe
conveyance
of
the
baggage
and
for
having
treated
with
a
want
of
courtesy
a
native
commissioned
officer
of
the
regiment
i
need
scarcely
say
that
this
reprimand
will
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
my
night
rest
but
the
complainant
will
forget
it
said
i
before
he
gets
back
to
the
regiment
forget
it
exclaimed
the
lieutenant
forget
it
a
native
especially
a
native
commissioned
officer
forget
a
grievance
catch
that
old
man
forgetting
the
slightest
unpleasantness
that
has
occurred
to
him
during
this
march
he
will
it
is
true
forget
his
present
grievance
when
he
has
a
fresh
one
but
at
the
end
of
the
journey
they
will
be
forthcoming
in
a
lump
this
prophecy
was
destined
not
to
be
fulfilled
for
presently
a
sepoy
came
to
the
lieutenant
and
reported
that
the
soubahdar
was
very
we
hastened
to
the
old
man
tent
and
found
him
strange
to
say
in
the
last
extremity
he
was
going
very
fast
but
nevertheless
he
continued
to
gurgle
forth
a
grievance
he
demanded
with
his
last
breath
why
the
east
india
company
did
not
give
him
his
pay
as
in
lord
lake
time
in
rupees
you
shall
in
future
receive
it
in
rupees
said
the
lieutenant
bending
over
the
old
man
whose
hand
he
grasped
tightly
and
will
my
losses
be
made
good
he
asked
with
awful
energy
yes
said
the
lieutenant
it
is
well
and
the
old
man
slipped
almost
imperceptibly
from
one
world
to
another
that
the
old
soubahdar
who
was
upwards
of
eighty
had
died
of
natural
causes
there
could
be
no
question
but
clamorous
as
was
the
entire
company
for
the
interment
of
the
body
the
lieutenant
determined
on
taking
it
to
agra
for
the
purpose
of
a
surgical
examination
meanwhile
the
old
man
effects
were
scrupulously
collected
and
put
under
seal
we
were
now
only
miles
from
agra
the
capital
of
the
north
west
provinces
and
it
was
agreed
to
perform
the
distance
in
one
march
we
therefore
started
at
sundown
and
travelled
all
night
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
the
road
was
in
excellent
order
and
notwithstanding
that
the
old
soubahdar
was
lying
lifeless
on
the
top
of
some
of
the
the
sepoys
were
in
high
spirits
and
on
several
occasions
even
jocular
in
respect
to
the
deceased
weakness
that
of
perpetually
grumbling
shortly
after
the
day
had
dawned
i
beheld
on
the
distant
horizon
something
like
a
large
white
cloud
had
we
been
at
sea
i
should
have
said
it
was
a
sail
or
an
iceberg
to
which
it
bore
a
striking
resemblance
i
pointed
it
out
to
the
lieutenant
who
smiled
do
you
know
what
that
is
he
said
no
i
answered
ca
you
guess
no
what
is
it
that
is
the
famous
taj
mahal
that
is
the
building
that
defies
the
most
graphic
pen
in
the
world
to
do
justice
to
its
grandeur
and
its
transcendent
beauty
bulwer
in
the
of
has
a
passage
which
sometimes
reminds
me
of
the
taj
a
palace
lifting
to
eternal
summer
its
marble
halls
from
out
a
glassy
bower
of
coolest
foliage
musical
with
birds
but
how
far
short
must
any
description
of
such
a
place
fall
how
far
distant
do
you
suppose
we
are
from
that
building
about
two
miles
upwards
of
nine
miles
as
the
crow
flies
yes
that
is
the
taj
the
tomb
of
a
woman
the
wife
of
the
emperor
shah
jehan
the
pure
white
marble
of
which
it
is
built
was
brought
from
ajmere
for
upwards
of
years
thousand
men
were
employed
day
by
day
on
that
edifice
i
am
afraid
to
say
how
many
millions
it
cost
the
mahrattas
carried
away
the
huge
silver
gates
and
made
them
into
rupees
what
became
of
the
inner
gate
which
was
formed
of
a
single
piece
of
agate
no
one
can
say
the
general
opinion
is
that
it
is
buried
somewhere
in
bhurtpore
the
original
idea
was
to
build
a
corresponding
tomb
on
this
side
of
the
river
for
the
emperor
himself
and
connect
the
two
by
a
bridge
of
white
marble
a
very
pretty
idea
was
it
not
lord
william
bentinck
was
for
pulling
the
taj
down
and
selling
the
marble
or
using
it
for
building
purposes
impossible
not
at
all
he
thought
it
was
very
impolitic
to
allow
these
gorgeous
edifices
to
stand
these
monuments
of
folly
extravagance
and
superstition
which
served
none
but
the
worst
of
prejudices
leading
the
natives
to
draw
prejudicial
comparisons
between
the
simple
and
economical
structures
of
the
british
and
these
stupendous
and
costly
erections
of
the
moghul
emperors
and
most
assuredly
our
bungalows
churches
and
other
buildings
do
present
a
most
beggarly
appearance
alongside
these
masses
of
polished
marble
and
red
stone
it
looks
as
though
we
had
no
confidence
in
our
hold
of
the
country
and
therefore
would
not
go
to
any
expense
worth
speaking
of
look
at
our
in
the
civil
lines
as
that
part
of
agra
is
called
a
parcel
of
paltry
brick
and
mortar
not
to
be
compared
with
the
tenements
that
the
menial
servants
of
the
emperors
inhabited
look
at
the
government
house
the
metcalfe
testimonial
and
other
paltry
european
edifices
surely
said
i
you
would
preserve
rather
than
deface
or
destroy
these
magnificent
works
of
art
these
wonders
of
the
world
works
of
art
and
wonders
of
the
world
they
doubtless
are
but
under
existing
circumstances
they
are
and
i
would
pull
down
every
one
of
them
and
convert
the
material
into
useful
buildings
barracks
splendid
barracks
for
our
british
and
native
troops
hospitals
worthy
of
being
called
hospitals
churches
magazines
and
so
forth
but
what
barbarians
the
natives
would
think
us
what
does
that
signify
are
we
the
conquerors
of
the
country
or
are
we
not
as
to
what
they
would
think
of
us
they
ca
think
much
worse
of
us
than
they
do
already
do
we
not
eat
swine
flesh
and
do
not
english
ladies
dance
the
natives
call
it
about
and
with
men
who
are
not
their
husbands
barbarians
why
the
very
dress
that
we
wear
renders
us
barbarians
in
their
sight
the
sun
had
now
risen
high
in
the
heavens
and
his
rays
fell
upon
the
taj
which
we
were
gradually
approaching
i
was
wrapped
in
admiration
and
wishing
in
my
inmost
heart
that
my
talkative
companion
would
cease
and
leave
me
to
gaze
in
silence
on
that
glorious
scene
when
suddenly
the
procession
halted
and
the
lieutenant
shouted
out
the
word
hulloa
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
i
was
completely
startled
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
matter
the
lieutenant
echoed
me
matter
look
there
is
a
wheel
off
one
of
those
rickety
carts
and
those
confounded
boxes
are
scattered
all
over
the
road
here
the
little
officer
bounded
like
an
ball
from
his
seat
and
in
a
towering
passion
with
all
the
world
in
general
but
no
one
in
particular
rushed
to
the
spot
where
the
disaster
had
occurred
and
there
began
to
fret
fume
and
snort
most
violently
hush
sahib
said
one
of
the
sepoys
saluting
his
officer
very
respectfully
or
you
may
wake
the
soubahdar
and
what
will
happen
this
appeal
had
the
effect
of
restoring
the
lieutenant
to
calmness
and
he
smiled
and
seemed
to
feel
that
matters
would
certainly
have
been
worse
and
the
delay
more
protracted
had
the
old
man
been
alive
and
witnessed
the
accident
one
of
the
boxes
was
smashed
to
pieces
and
the
rupees
were
lying
about
in
all
directions
the
sepoys
picking
them
up
and
searching
for
others
in
the
dust
and
sand
i
never
witnessed
a
more
ridiculous
or
grotesque
scene
than
this
the
native
soldiers
in
their
red
coats
and
chacos
but
with
bare
legs
and
without
shoes
kneeling
and
sifting
the
earth
through
their
fingers
the
lieutenant
in
his
pyjamahs
and
solar
hat
a
cheroot
in
his
mouth
and
in
his
hand
the
which
he
used
as
a
baton
while
giving
his
orders
does
this
often
happen
i
was
tempted
to
ask
constantly
was
the
lieutenant
reply
the
government
has
a
for
the
conveyance
of
stores
and
even
private
individuals
by
paying
for
the
carriage
may
have
their
goods
taken
from
station
to
station
but
in
respect
to
treasure
we
cling
to
the
old
system
the
military
authorities
apply
to
the
magistrates
whose
subordinates
provide
these
hackeries
which
were
in
vogue
some
five
thousand
years
ago
and
just
observe
those
rotten
boxes
why
are
they
not
lined
with
cast
iron
or
zinc
it
would
be
too
expensive
the
government
can
not
afford
it
but
why
should
not
the
government
use
its
own
for
the
conveyance
of
treasure
instead
of
hiring
these
antiquated
and
rotten
conveyances
because
the
is
under
the
authorities
and
the
military
authorities
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
authorities
is
that
a
reason
no
nor
is
it
rhyme
but
it
is
a
part
of
our
indian
system
and
what
is
more
it
is
government
logic
however
i
am
not
going
to
stop
here
all
day
we
will
push
on
and
get
into
agra
before
breakfast
the
treasure
will
come
all
right
enough
and
i
will
be
there
to
meet
it
at
the
office
of
the
magistrate
and
collector
we
now
took
our
seats
in
the
old
buggy
the
hood
was
raised
the
syce
sat
behind
and
off
we
went
at
a
canter
which
very
soon
became
a
gallop
in
the
parlance
of
the
lieutenant
the
old
horse
was
indeed
a
ripper
when
warm
there
was
no
holding
him
and
he
went
over
his
seven
and
a
half
miles
of
ground
in
minutes
at
the
bridge
of
boats
which
crosses
the
jumna
we
met
by
chance
the
assistant
magistrate
the
friend
with
whom
i
was
going
to
stay
and
the
husband
of
the
lieutenant
first
cousin
he
was
dressed
in
a
pair
of
large
corduroy
breeches
a
and
a
solar
helmet
and
was
riding
an
immensely
powerful
cape
horse
he
did
not
recognise
either
of
us
at
first
but
pulled
up
and
turned
round
the
moment
the
lieutenant
shouted
out
his
name
with
the
addition
of
old
boy
household
words
in
the
mouth
of
the
lieutenant
for
he
not
only
applied
them
to
things
animate
but
inanimate
for
instance
his
corkscrew
his
teapot
his
buggy
his
watch
his
hat
everything
with
him
was
an
old
boy
in
common
with
the
or
the
general
commanding
the
division
after
i
had
been
greeted
by
my
friend
who
had
been
at
a
loss
to
account
for
my
delay
in
reaching
agra
the
lieutenant
thus
addressed
him
i
say
old
boy
look
here
i
have
a
lot
of
treasure
for
you
about
seven
or
eight
miles
from
this
but
there
has
been
a
break
down
send
out
a
lot
of
fellows
to
give
assistance
will
you
yes
and
look
here
old
boy
there
a
dead
soubahdar
a
what
a
dead
soubahdar
he
died
suddenly
and
i
do
wish
him
to
be
buried
without
an
examination
because
i
bullied
him
mildly
only
a
short
time
previous
to
his
going
out
you
will
manage
that
for
me
old
boy
you
oh
yes
he
died
of
old
age
and
his
last
grievance
but
still
i
should
like
a
medical
man
certificate
just
to
satisfy
the
colonel
who
served
with
him
in
lord
lake
time
you
know
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
can
manage
all
that
for
you
replied
the
official
riding
by
the
side
of
the
buggy
but
push
on
for
the
sun
is
becoming
rather
oppressive
and
i
have
no
hood
to
my
saddle
remember
my
host
and
hostess
made
me
as
comfortable
and
as
happy
as
any
traveller
could
wish
to
be
made
of
the
former
i
saw
little
or
nothing
from
eleven
in
the
morning
till
three
or
four
in
the
evening
for
he
was
what
is
called
a
conscientious
officer
and
attended
strictly
to
his
work
during
these
hours
i
used
to
read
or
pay
a
visit
to
the
of
a
regiment
where
a
was
kept
to
the
officers
of
the
regiment
i
was
introduced
by
lieutenant
sixtie
previous
to
his
return
to
his
own
corps
he
stayed
eight
days
in
agra
upon
some
plea
or
other
and
sent
his
company
on
in
advance
of
him
agra
that
is
to
say
the
society
of
agra
was
at
the
time
split
into
two
sections
the
civil
and
the
military
they
were
not
exactly
at
open
war
but
there
was
a
coolness
existing
between
the
two
branches
they
did
not
invite
each
other
and
very
seldom
exchanged
calls
for
me
who
was
desirous
of
seeing
all
parties
this
was
rather
awkward
living
as
i
was
in
the
house
of
a
civilian
so
i
resolved
upon
taking
a
small
bungalow
for
a
short
period
and
furnishing
it
in
a
mild
and
inexpensive
manner
i
was
candid
enough
to
confess
to
my
host
that
as
i
was
in
no
way
connected
with
either
branch
of
the
service
i
was
anxious
to
avoid
taking
any
part
in
their
local
differences
and
he
had
the
good
sense
not
to
press
me
to
remain
under
his
roof
a
few
days
after
i
had
located
myself
in
my
bungalow
i
received
a
call
from
a
native
gentleman
a
seik
chieftain
who
was
and
now
is
a
state
prisoner
on
a
handsome
stipend
he
drove
up
to
my
door
in
a
small
phaeton
drawn
by
a
pair
of
large
black
mules
of
incredible
swiftness
and
agility
this
fallen
chieftain
a
tall
and
man
was
no
other
than
the
renowned
rajah
lall
singh
who
commanded
the
seik
cavalry
at
the
battle
of
ferozeshah
and
who
was
subsequently
prime
minister
at
lahore
during
a
portion
of
the
time
that
the
british
government
undertook
the
administration
of
the
punjab
on
behalf
of
maharajah
dulleep
singh
lall
singh
was
now
studying
surgery
more
than
one
medical
officer
in
charge
of
the
hospitals
which
he
attended
informed
me
that
the
rajah
was
already
a
comparatively
skilful
operator
and
could
take
off
an
arm
or
a
leg
with
surprising
dexterity
notwithstanding
his
previous
character
that
of
a
sensualist
and
faithless
intriguer
one
indeed
who
had
not
been
constant
even
to
his
own
villanies
i
could
not
help
liking
his
conversation
which
was
humorously
enlivened
with
imitations
of
english
officers
with
whom
he
had
come
in
contact
and
was
entertaining
to
the
last
degree
his
anecdotes
relating
to
the
late
runjeet
singh
were
peculiarly
interesting
coming
as
they
did
from
the
lips
of
a
man
who
had
been
so
much
in
the
company
of
that
remarkable
monarch
who
in
many
respects
resembled
napoleon
the
first
especially
in
the
selection
of
the
instruments
of
his
power
all
his
runjeet
chief
men
said
the
rajah
were
persons
of
obscure
origin
tej
singh
sawan
mull
deenanauth
and
the
rest
of
them
but
you
were
an
exception
said
i
indeed
not
was
his
reply
i
began
life
as
a
muleteer
and
hence
my
partiality
for
mules
perhaps
after
a
while
the
rajah
invited
me
to
take
a
drive
with
him
to
a
house
about
two
miles
in
the
country
and
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
jumna
it
was
not
his
own
house
which
was
then
under
repair
he
said
but
had
been
placed
at
his
disposal
by
a
friend
i
thanked
the
rajah
and
stepped
into
his
carriage
he
followed
me
seized
the
reins
shook
the
whip
and
away
we
went
at
the
rate
of
sixteen
miles
an
hour
the
at
which
we
soon
arrived
was
a
spacious
building
of
european
architecture
it
had
formerly
belonged
to
a
general
officer
who
had
married
a
native
woman
of
considerable
wealth
the
furniture
was
all
of
european
make
and
was
arranged
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
that
in
the
sahib
logue
apartments
at
bhitoor
in
point
of
quality
it
was
also
very
much
the
same
a
portion
costly
and
the
rest
of
a
common
description
this
house
too
was
constantly
inhabited
by
english
folks
who
sought
a
change
of
air
for
a
few
days
since
his
removal
to
agra
lall
singh
lived
more
like
an
european
than
a
native
and
had
got
into
the
habit
of
sitting
at
ease
in
a
chair
instead
of
like
a
tailor
on
the
carpet
his
dress
was
of
the
simplest
and
most
unpretending
character
imaginable
and
with
the
exception
of
a
on
his
forefinger
he
had
no
ornament
on
his
person
the
table
of
the
apartment
to
which
he
conducted
me
was
literally
covered
with
surgical
instruments
saws
knives
scalpels
of
every
size
and
shape
amongst
them
i
perceived
a
pair
of
swords
in
wooden
scabbards
covered
with
rich
green
velvet
and
ornamented
with
gold
and
precious
stones
observing
that
my
eyes
rested
on
these
swords
he
took
one
up
and
remarked
these
have
performed
some
curious
operations
in
their
time
but
never
in
a
hospital
they
have
been
used
chiefly
for
taking
off
heads
this
once
belonged
to
dhyan
singh
and
that
to
heera
singh
who
were
both
assassinated
they
are
of
damascus
steel
and
are
sharper
than
any
of
these
knives
or
scalpels
i
have
sent
a
number
of
swords
to
england
to
have
them
made
into
surgical
instruments
here
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
domestic
who
announced
the
lallah
sahib
and
presently
a
native
gentleman
walked
or
rather
limped
for
he
was
lame
of
the
right
leg
into
the
room
and
made
a
very
graceful
salaam
first
to
the
rajah
and
then
to
myself
he
was
rather
short
in
stature
but
very
stoutly
built
and
about
forty
years
of
age
his
eyes
were
full
of
intelligence
and
vigour
and
his
features
regular
and
his
manners
were
easy
affable
unassuming
and
modest
and
his
attire
as
plain
and
quiet
as
possible
this
gentleman
sahib
said
the
rajah
addressing
me
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
this
house
belongs
to
him
a
strange
world
is
this
only
a
few
years
ago
i
offered
a
reward
of
a
lac
of
rupees
ten
thousand
pounds
for
his
head
or
two
lacs
to
any
one
who
would
bring
him
alive
to
my
tent
indeed
yes
and
if
i
had
caught
him
how
changed
would
have
been
the
whole
face
of
affairs
in
this
country
how
so
this
gentleman
was
the
contractor
for
the
british
army
and
if
i
had
got
hold
of
him
the
army
could
not
have
been
supplied
but
why
was
he
worth
more
alive
than
dead
i
asked
with
a
laugh
in
which
the
native
gentleman
heartily
joined
because
returned
the
rajah
coolly
if
we
had
secured
him
alive
we
would
have
made
him
feed
us
with
the
supplies
bought
with
his
own
money
which
should
also
have
paid
the
reward
for
his
capture
this
by
the
way
was
claimed
by
several
who
brought
in
heads
alleging
that
each
was
the
head
of
the
lallah
the
contractor
but
the
attempted
imposition
was
discovered
and
the
perpetrators
were
themselves
decapitated
unlike
hindoos
and
mussulmans
who
drink
in
secret
lall
singh
drank
neat
brandy
openly
and
rising
from
his
chair
he
administered
unto
himself
a
couple
of
glasses
or
rather
a
tumbler
on
this
occasion
he
could
take
more
than
two
bottles
of
brandy
without
being
in
the
least
intoxicated
this
was
owing
of
course
to
the
circumstance
that
he
consumed
considerable
quantities
of
bhang
just
in
the
same
way
that
an
is
rarely
or
never
affected
by
drinking
deeply
of
wine
the
rajah
visitor
the
lallah
jooteepers√¢d
had
a
grievance
and
a
rather
substantial
one
he
had
claimed
from
the
government
lacs
of
rupees
half
a
million
and
pounds
sterling
as
the
balance
due
to
him
for
feeding
the
armies
employed
during
the
two
seik
campaigns
and
the
government
had
threatened
to
prosecute
him
in
one
of
their
own
courts
for
an
attempt
to
make
an
overcharge
of
forty
thousand
rupees
or
four
thousand
pounds
and
if
they
understand
the
principles
of
good
government
thoroughly
said
the
rajah
they
will
convict
you
imprison
you
for
life
and
confiscate
all
your
possessions
real
and
personal
that
is
the
way
the
lahore
durbar
would
have
settled
so
large
a
claim
but
the
indian
government
has
not
the
courage
to
act
in
that
way
but
i
have
not
attempted
to
make
an
overcharge
and
if
my
agents
have
done
so
let
it
be
deducted
if
it
be
incorrect
said
the
lallah
you
are
a
criminal
said
the
rajah
how
so
asked
the
lallah
you
say
the
government
owes
you
lacs
yes
and
honestly
well
is
not
that
enough
to
warrant
your
being
transported
for
life
or
hanged
but
as
i
have
told
you
the
government
has
not
courage
to
prosecute
you
in
this
opinion
however
lall
singh
was
in
error
for
that
very
night
the
lallah
was
informed
that
he
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
prisoner
and
must
not
leave
agra
the
firm
belief
of
every
native
not
only
in
the
district
but
throughout
india
was
that
these
proceedings
had
been
taken
to
evade
payment
of
the
contractor
just
demands
but
the
lallah
himself
was
the
first
to
deny
this
assertion
and
to
declare
that
the
prosecution
arose
out
of
the
circumstance
of
the
being
a
near
relative
of
the
of
india
that
a
civilian
in
power
had
a
quarrel
with
the
and
had
represented
that
great
frauds
had
been
committed
and
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
heads
of
the
departments
were
cognisant
of
such
frauds
that
the
anxious
that
the
honour
of
a
member
of
his
ancient
family
should
be
cleared
up
had
determined
upon
a
strict
investigation
and
that
the
civilian
in
question
suggested
the
public
prosecution
of
the
contractor
as
the
speediest
and
most
satisfactory
means
of
arriving
at
the
result
and
such
was
the
opinion
of
many
officers
of
the
government
civil
and
military
the
contractor
however
was
eventually
acquitted
and
the
government
paid
the
bill
but
to
this
day
the
natives
of
india
believe
that
the
object
of
the
government
was
to
cheat
their
creditor
while
the
officers
civil
and
military
are
equally
sanguine
that
it
was
the
honour
of
the
family
that
led
to
the
most
extraordinary
and
protracted
trial
that
ever
was
known
in
india
and
which
was
emphatically
denounced
by
the
press
and
public
of
every
country
in
europe
as
absurd
unjust
and
shameful
nevertheless
jooteepers√¢d
can
not
have
harboured
any
revenge
for
the
wrongs
involving
disgrace
and
dishonour
which
were
heaped
upon
him
for
it
is
he
who
has
fed
for
several
months
the
five
thousand
christians
during
their
incarceration
in
the
fortress
of
agra
and
amongst
the
number
of
civilians
there
shut
up
is
the
gentleman
who
conducted
the
prosecution
on
the
behalf
of
the
government
and
who
in
the
execution
of
his
duty
strove
very
hard
indeed
for
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
jooteepers√¢d
we
could
not
have
held
agra
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
it
was
cool
enough
to
walk
abroad
lall
singh
led
me
into
the
extensive
gardens
which
surrounded
his
temporary
abode
the
lallah
had
left
us
and
i
was
now
alone
with
the
of
the
seik
cavalry
and
the
minister
of
lahore
i
felt
much
more
pleasure
in
his
society
than
i
should
have
felt
had
he
been
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
for
he
bore
his
altered
condition
with
great
dignity
and
cheerfulness
and
discoursed
upon
all
sorts
of
topics
without
any
restraint
or
reserve
he
even
talked
about
the
ranee
of
lahore
with
whom
his
name
had
been
so
frequently
coupled
and
with
a
chivalrous
spirit
whether
his
assertions
were
true
or
not
is
another
matter
assured
me
that
his
intrigues
with
her
had
been
confined
exclusively
to
politics
i
asked
him
where
this
helpless
woman
had
fled
to
after
her
miraculous
escape
from
benares
in
the
garb
of
a
man
he
replied
that
he
knew
not
he
was
sure
she
was
not
in
nepal
where
the
authorities
supposed
her
to
be
but
somewhere
in
our
own
provinces
was
she
a
beautiful
woman
i
asked
no
and
never
had
been
was
his
reply
but
she
had
eyes
which
could
charm
like
those
of
a
snake
and
a
voice
sweeter
than
that
of
a
bird
they
say
she
was
the
messalina
of
the
east
and
i
explained
to
him
what
the
allusion
signified
it
is
not
true
he
exclaimed
vehemently
she
was
a
vain
and
clever
woman
but
the
very
opposite
of
the
character
that
she
has
been
described
she
was
proud
of
the
influence
she
possessed
over
men
in
making
them
subservient
to
her
will
and
her
caprices
had
she
great
power
over
runjeet
singh
none
she
was
his
doll
his
plaything
and
the
only
being
who
could
calm
him
when
he
had
the
horrors
nothing
more
how
the
horrors
runjeet
singh
began
life
as
a
petty
chieftain
with
a
few
hundred
followers
he
acquired
a
vast
kingdom
and
had
the
most
powerful
army
that
the
east
ever
saw
or
will
see
whilst
he
went
on
conquering
shedding
blood
and
plundering
he
was
easy
in
his
mind
but
when
he
found
that
he
had
got
as
much
as
he
could
manage
he
stopped
and
then
came
his
disquiet
his
great
fear
then
was
that
he
could
not
retain
what
he
had
become
possessed
of
and
his
chief
horror
was
that
the
would
be
carried
off
that
diamond
which
runjeet
singh
stole
and
which
the
ranee
has
worn
a
thousand
times
as
a
bracelet
that
diamond
which
is
now
in
the
crown
of
england
where
did
it
come
from
originally
no
one
can
say
that
the
history
of
the
has
yet
to
be
written
did
you
ever
see
a
likeness
of
runjeet
singh
never
then
i
will
show
you
a
very
faithful
one
a
miniature
taken
by
a
famous
painter
who
came
from
delhi
and
spent
his
life
in
lahore
the
maharajah
was
a
diminutive
shrivelled
man
frightfully
pitted
with
the
which
had
destroyed
one
of
his
eyes
but
with
the
other
he
could
gaze
for
an
hour
without
ever
winking
he
had
a
shrill
and
squeaking
voice
but
it
terrified
those
who
heard
it
especially
when
he
was
angry
he
did
not
talk
much
but
he
was
a
great
listener
then
shrivelled
and
emaciated
as
he
was
in
his
later
years
he
was
possessed
of
immense
physical
strength
when
roused
and
upon
horseback
where
skill
could
be
exercised
few
men
in
his
kingdom
could
have
disarmed
him
indeed
he
inspired
all
those
who
approached
him
whether
european
or
native
with
respect
mingled
with
intense
fear
our
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
a
gardener
who
presented
the
rajah
and
myself
respectively
with
a
nosegay
and
who
volunteered
the
information
that
some
workmen
in
digging
the
foundation
for
a
vine
trellis
had
come
upon
an
old
house
under
the
earth
and
in
it
had
been
found
several
gold
and
silver
coins
where
asked
the
rajah
there
said
the
gardener
pointing
in
the
direction
we
hurried
to
the
spot
and
found
that
the
workmen
had
gone
but
sure
enough
there
were
the
walls
of
an
apartment
formed
of
red
stone
and
white
marble
this
quarter
of
agra
said
the
rajah
to
me
was
formerly
inhabited
by
persons
of
the
highest
rank
where
we
are
now
standing
was
no
doubt
once
the
site
of
a
palace
and
these
walls
are
those
of
the
a
vault
beneath
the
dwelling
from
which
the
light
is
excluded
in
these
dark
places
are
usually
perpetrated
what
you
english
call
deeds
i
expressed
a
desire
to
explore
this
newly
discovered
apartment
of
former
days
but
the
rajah
told
me
it
was
then
too
late
as
the
workmen
had
gone
but
he
promised
me
that
if
i
would
come
to
him
at
daylight
on
the
following
morning
he
would
have
great
pleasure
in
gratifying
my
curiosity
on
the
following
morning
having
spent
a
very
dreamy
night
i
was
carried
in
my
palanquin
to
the
jatnee
bagh
such
was
the
name
of
jooteepers√¢d
in
which
lall
singh
then
resided
the
rajah
was
dressing
i
was
confronted
by
a
seik
with
an
enormous
beard
whose
hair
was
a
yard
long
and
tied
up
in
a
peculiar
knot
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
who
politely
inquired
if
i
would
take
coffee
ere
long
the
rajah
made
his
appearance
and
we
went
together
to
the
newly
discovered
which
was
now
guarded
since
gold
and
silver
had
been
found
there
the
workmen
some
twenty
in
number
came
and
commenced
their
labour
that
of
clearing
away
the
earth
in
all
directions
in
order
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
apartment
in
the
this
was
accomplished
in
about
two
hours
and
we
then
stood
upon
a
in
the
centre
of
a
room
about
sixteen
feet
square
in
several
of
the
niches
were
little
lamps
such
as
are
burnt
upon
the
tombs
of
moslems
and
a
hookah
and
a
pair
of
marble
chairs
were
found
in
the
subterraneous
apartment
of
which
the
sky
was
now
the
roof
whilst
examining
the
walls
i
observed
that
upon
one
side
there
was
a
ledge
about
six
feet
high
from
the
floor
and
carried
up
therefrom
and
about
a
foot
in
width
this
ledge
which
was
of
brick
and
plaster
resembled
a
huge
mantelpiece
and
was
continued
from
one
end
of
the
apartment
to
the
other
i
asked
the
rajah
the
reason
of
such
a
structure
in
the
apartment
he
replied
that
he
did
not
know
nor
could
any
of
the
workmen
account
for
it
one
of
them
however
took
a
pickaxe
and
dug
out
a
portion
when
to
my
surprise
and
horror
i
discovered
that
in
this
wall
a
human
being
had
been
bricked
up
the
skin
was
still
upon
the
bones
which
were
covered
with
a
costly
dress
of
white
muslin
spangled
all
over
with
gold
around
the
neck
was
a
string
of
pearls
on
the
wrists
and
ankles
were
gold
bangles
and
on
the
feet
were
a
pair
of
slippers
embroidered
all
over
with
silver
wire
or
thread
such
slippers
as
only
mahommedan
women
of
rank
or
wealth
can
afford
to
wear
the
body
resembled
a
mummy
the
features
were
very
distinct
and
were
those
of
a
woman
whose
age
could
not
at
the
time
of
her
death
have
exceeded
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
the
head
was
partially
covered
with
the
white
dress
long
black
hair
was
still
clinging
to
the
scalp
and
was
parted
across
the
forehead
and
carried
behind
the
ears
it
was
the
most
horrible
and
ghastly
figure
that
i
ever
beheld
the
workmen
appeared
to
take
this
discovery
as
a
matter
of
course
or
rather
to
regard
it
only
with
reference
to
the
gold
and
silver
ornaments
upon
the
skeleton
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
could
prevent
them
stripping
it
forthwith
as
for
the
rajah
he
simply
smiled
and
coolly
remarked
a
case
of
jealousy
her
husband
was
jealous
of
her
and
thought
her
guilty
and
punished
her
thus
bricked
her
up
alive
in
this
wall
with
no
room
to
move
about
only
standing
room
perhaps
she
deserved
it
perhaps
she
was
plotting
against
his
life
perhaps
she
was
innocent
who
can
say
hindoos
as
well
as
mahommedans
punish
their
wives
in
that
way
you
mean
that
they
used
to
do
so
in
former
times
previous
to
british
rule
in
india
but
such
a
thing
could
not
occur
in
our
time
it
does
not
occur
so
often
as
it
did
but
it
does
occur
sometimes
even
in
these
days
how
do
you
know
what
happens
in
the
establishment
of
a
wealthy
native
let
us
look
a
little
further
into
the
wall
it
strikes
me
that
we
shall
find
some
more
of
them
orders
were
given
accordingly
to
the
workmen
to
remove
with
great
care
the
whole
of
the
ledge
in
short
to
pull
away
its
entire
face
this
was
done
and
how
shall
i
describe
the
awful
spectacle
then
presented
in
that
wall
there
were
no
less
than
bodies
four
besides
that
already
alluded
to
one
of
the
number
was
a
young
man
who
from
his
dress
and
the
jewels
on
his
must
have
been
a
person
of
high
rank
perhaps
the
lover
of
one
or
both
of
the
young
women
for
he
had
been
bricked
up
between
two
of
them
the
others
were
evidently
those
of
confidential
servants
old
women
for
they
had
grey
hair
they
possibly
had
been
cognisant
or
were
supposed
to
be
cognisant
of
whatever
offence
the
others
had
been
deemed
guilty
the
sun
was
now
shining
brightly
on
these
ghastly
remains
covered
with
garments
embroidered
in
gold
and
silver
the
air
had
a
speedy
effect
on
them
and
one
by
one
they
fell
each
forming
a
heap
of
bones
hair
shrivelled
skin
dust
jewels
and
finery
the
latter
were
now
gathered
up
placed
in
a
small
basket
and
sent
to
lallah
their
value
possibly
was
upwards
of
a
thousand
pounds
how
many
years
had
passed
since
that
horrible
sentence
had
been
put
into
execution
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
seventy
or
perhaps
two
hundred
indian
society
whilst
i
was
at
agra
a
distinguished
military
officer
of
high
rank
who
had
just
been
appointed
as
a
member
of
the
council
passed
through
the
station
on
his
way
to
the
seat
of
government
calcutta
it
was
supposed
that
this
general
officer
would
on
the
first
vacancy
become
of
bengal
and
of
course
the
society
of
agra
was
resolved
to
do
him
honour
it
would
not
do
for
anybody
to
hang
back
on
an
occasion
like
this
and
for
the
nonce
both
the
civilians
and
the
military
were
of
one
mind
and
actually
met
on
an
amicable
and
pleasant
footing
to
talk
the
matter
over
and
to
decide
upon
what
was
to
be
done
after
a
friendly
debate
which
lasted
for
four
hours
it
was
resolved
that
sir
gunter
and
lady
gallopaway
should
be
invited
to
a
ball
and
supper
and
not
to
a
dinner
it
was
further
determined
that
the
entertainment
should
take
place
not
at
that
would
be
too
civil
not
at
any
that
would
be
too
military
but
at
a
hall
called
the
metcalfe
institution
this
being
perfectly
neutral
ground
my
friend
the
civilian
with
whom
i
had
been
staying
had
a
perfect
contempt
for
these
local
squabbles
although
he
was
really
compelled
to
take
a
part
therein
and
after
the
meeting
was
over
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
metrical
squib
ridiculing
the
whole
affair
and
sent
it
for
publication
to
one
of
the
newspapers
the
for
this
squib
seeing
that
it
sneered
at
both
the
civilians
and
the
military
i
unfortunately
got
the
credit
and
the
consequence
was
that
when
i
made
my
appearance
at
the
ball
several
of
the
heads
of
the
society
who
had
formerly
received
me
with
extreme
cordiality
answered
me
only
in
monosyllables
when
i
addressed
them
indeed
i
learnt
afterwards
from
my
friend
wife
that
a
meeting
had
actually
been
called
to
consider
the
propriety
of
not
inviting
me
and
that
i
had
very
narrowly
escaped
that
punishment
for
had
it
not
been
for
the
vote
of
her
husband
my
name
would
have
been
omitted
as
there
were
ten
for
and
ten
against
me
when
he
held
up
his
hand
in
my
favour
but
to
the
ball
there
were
present
some
twenty
civilians
all
dressed
in
black
with
white
cravats
and
each
had
brought
with
him
his
wife
or
a
sister
or
daughter
of
military
men
all
in
full
dress
uniform
there
were
about
or
fifty
and
the
ladies
who
came
with
them
may
have
numbered
thirty
in
all
say
that
there
were
present
including
visitors
and
stragglers
like
myself
one
hundred
and
forty
i
was
rather
late
and
on
entering
the
room
beheld
one
of
the
oddest
sights
that
i
ever
witnessed
all
the
black
coats
were
huddled
together
and
so
were
all
the
reds
they
had
been
unanimous
only
so
far
as
giving
the
entertainment
was
concerned
and
it
seemed
to
be
distinctly
understood
by
each
party
that
there
was
to
be
no
mixing
and
so
the
civilians
formed
quadrilles
and
danced
with
the
civil
ladies
and
the
soldiers
with
the
military
ladies
had
there
been
a
royal
regiment
in
agra
there
would
have
been
three
parties
owing
to
the
jealousy
that
existed
formerly
between
the
queen
and
the
company
officers
besides
myself
there
were
two
interlopers
in
the
east
present
at
that
ball
the
one
a
french
gentleman
the
other
a
german
baron
they
too
were
travelling
about
in
search
of
the
picturesque
and
here
they
had
it
with
a
vengeance
the
frenchman
could
not
comprehend
this
exclusiveness
on
the
part
of
the
blacks
but
the
german
assured
us
that
to
him
it
was
a
very
common
sight
and
to
be
witnessed
at
every
ball
in
every
garrison
town
in
his
country
but
there
said
he
the
military
look
down
on
the
civilians
while
here
it
seems
to
me
that
the
civilians
look
down
on
the
military
see
see
see
how
disdainfully
that
old
revenue
board
scrutinizes
the
dress
of
damz√®
sure
enough
such
was
the
case
but
regard
said
the
frenchman
how
angry
is
that
sudder
adawlut
because
that
little
infantry
whose
husband
i
am
told
is
the
younger
son
of
a
poor
english
lord
is
contemplating
her
en
truly
this
is
a
magnificent
spectacle
is
it
always
so
i
wonder
i
was
enabled
from
experience
to
inform
him
that
in
almost
every
large
station
and
at
agra
especially
it
universally
occurs
but
that
in
small
stations
seldom
or
never
here
we
were
approached
by
damz√®
himself
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
the
foreign
gentlemen
on
either
side
of
me
he
passed
on
seemingly
proud
and
happy
at
having
had
an
opportunity
of
slighting
me
in
public
on
account
of
the
doggerel
for
which
i
had
the
credit
mais
monsieur
said
the
frenchman
to
me
who
in
wonder
name
are
all
these
damz√®
gentlemen
there
is
one
damz√®
colonel
of
such
a
regiment
another
damz√®
major
in
another
corps
there
is
a
deputy
damz√®
there
is
a
damz√®
in
the
indian
navy
another
damz√®
is
a
military
secretary
some
half
dozen
damz√®s
are
i
have
perceived
on
the
staff
of
the
parbleu
damz√®
toujours
damz√®
for
here
by
heaven
i
meet
with
still
another
damz√®
who
all
these
damz√®s
i
informed
him
that
damz√®
was
the
patronymic
of
a
nobleman
in
power
and
with
this
explanation
he
was
thoroughly
enlightened
and
appeared
to
be
perfectly
satisfied
let
us
move
up
towards
the
general
said
the
german
baron
who
had
been
introduced
to
the
old
hero
let
us
go
and
say
a
few
words
to
him
it
was
not
easy
to
do
this
hemmed
in
as
was
the
general
by
those
who
desired
to
make
him
remember
them
in
the
future
however
it
was
managed
at
last
and
somehow
or
other
we
three
interlopers
contrived
before
long
to
monopolize
his
attention
we
the
only
people
in
the
room
to
whom
he
could
not
be
of
any
service
for
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
give
or
get
for
us
if
we
had
wanted
his
patronage
we
rather
maliciously
so
far
as
the
crowd
was
concerned
stood
about
the
distinguished
old
man
and
guarded
him
and
i
have
reason
to
know
that
he
was
grateful
to
us
for
so
doing
towards
the
hour
of
twelve
however
we
had
to
stand
back
for
damz√®
came
and
sat
upon
the
sofa
on
the
left
side
of
the
general
and
talked
to
him
in
an
animated
but
somewhat
anxious
manner
which
became
even
more
anxious
when
revenue
board
approached
and
taking
a
seat
on
the
general
right
eyeing
damz√®
with
a
somewhat
haughty
expression
congratulated
the
general
on
his
recent
good
fortune
at
this
advanced
stage
of
the
evening
also
lady
gallopaway
was
flanked
right
and
left
by
old
revenue
board
and
damz√®
the
reader
is
requested
to
note
that
these
two
letters
were
damz√®
by
right
or
at
all
events
that
he
had
been
recommended
for
the
order
and
that
the
recommendation
had
been
instantly
attended
to
albeit
damz√®
had
never
been
within
range
of
an
enemy
cannon
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
lady
gallopaway
yawned
at
length
a
gong
sounded
and
the
band
struck
up
that
usual
signal
that
supper
is
ready
o
the
roast
beef
of
old
england
o
the
old
english
roast
beef
the
anxiety
of
the
ladies
who
sat
on
either
side
of
the
general
was
now
at
it
height
they
fanned
themselves
with
fearful
vigour
and
we
the
three
interlopers
fancied
that
we
could
hear
the
palpitation
of
their
hearts
meanwhile
their
husbands
respectively
by
their
looks
evinced
a
corresponding
anxiety
each
stood
ready
to
offer
his
arm
to
lady
gallopaway
as
soon
as
the
general
had
made
his
election
of
the
lady
he
would
lead
to
the
supper
table
each
party
was
equally
confident
but
equally
nervous
like
the
parties
to
a
lawsuit
for
weeks
past
this
question
of
precedence
had
been
debated
in
agra
and
very
warmly
debated
namely
whether
revenue
board
of
the
civil
service
or
damz√®
was
entitled
to
the
now
was
the
moment
for
a
decision
or
at
all
events
an
authority
in
support
of
either
position
or
argument
the
old
general
upon
whom
both
revenue
board
and
damz√®
had
their
anxious
eyes
rose
smiled
bowed
to
the
ladies
who
had
flanked
him
left
them
and
wandered
about
the
looking
to
the
right
and
left
as
if
searching
for
some
one
presently
he
stopped
short
before
little
infantry
who
was
talking
to
a
cornet
of
the
light
cavalry
the
general
offered
her
his
arm
she
took
it
very
graciously
and
was
led
away
but
before
leaving
the
room
she
halted
turned
round
and
stared
very
significantly
at
the
two
elderly
ladies
who
were
still
seated
on
the
sofa
overwhelmed
in
surprise
horror
and
indignation
infantry
who
was
only
a
lieutenant
in
his
regiment
observing
that
the
general
had
recognised
the
social
right
of
his
wife
which
she
had
derived
solely
from
him
instantly
rushed
up
to
lady
gallopaway
and
offered
her
an
arm
which
she
took
led
her
away
in
triumph
leaving
his
own
colonel
damz√®
and
old
revenue
board
gasping
and
gaping
at
each
other
in
mutual
disgust
and
consternation
had
a
shell
burst
in
the
building
had
the
powder
magazine
exploded
and
shattered
all
the
windows
the
commotion
could
scarcely
have
been
greater
than
it
was
at
that
moment
no
one
could
account
for
this
extraordinary
conduct
or
caprice
as
it
was
termed
on
the
part
of
the
old
general
damz√®
who
had
just
been
flattering
him
concerning
his
wonderful
achievements
now
declared
that
the
old
fool
had
become
since
eighteen
hundred
and
while
revenue
board
who
a
quarter
of
an
hour
previously
had
to
the
general
face
held
forth
on
the
unflinching
independence
which
had
marked
his
character
through
life
now
protested
openly
protested
that
he
had
been
a
throughout
his
entire
career
and
had
some
object
in
thus
truckling
before
the
son
of
an
influential
peer
the
ladies
on
the
sofa
stared
at
each
other
now
commiseratingly
and
in
silence
for
at
least
two
minutes
then
simultaneously
ejaculated
what
it
mean
i
thought
it
would
have
been
me
said
revenue
board
you
said
damz√®
yes
why
not
my
husband
is
a
civilian
of
twenty
years
standing
is
not
my
husband
a
and
a
if
he
were
only
a
major
and
a
he
would
take
precedence
of
revenue
board
you
are
quite
mistaken
indeed
not
do
you
suppose
a
goes
for
nothing
no
but
here
damz√®
and
revenue
board
who
had
been
discussing
the
same
question
but
in
a
calmer
spirit
than
their
wives
approached
and
making
common
cause
against
the
upstart
enemy
infantry
and
his
wife
formed
a
quartette
and
went
into
the
supper
room
where
to
their
intense
mortification
they
heard
little
infantry
talking
loudly
on
purpose
to
attract
the
notice
of
all
present
what
was
even
more
mortifying
still
the
old
general
was
paying
her
marked
attention
the
red
party
that
is
to
say
the
military
were
in
very
high
spirits
the
black
the
civilians
correspondingly
depressed
the
quartette
consisting
of
damz√®
and
revenue
board
and
their
wives
ate
voraciously
but
evidently
without
appetite
they
sipped
their
wine
with
an
absent
formality
which
was
very
entertaining
to
who
were
in
no
way
interested
in
the
momentous
question
which
was
preying
on
their
very
souls
it
shall
not
end
here
said
damz√®
moodily
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
chandelier
not
indeed
said
revenue
board
i
shall
put
my
case
to
the
direct
said
damz√®
his
lordship
is
a
near
connexion
of
mine
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
that
said
revenue
board
but
it
is
my
intention
to
submit
my
case
to
his
lordship
through
bommerson
the
of
these
provinces
officially
and
if
his
lordship
opinion
should
be
adverse
i
shall
have
my
appeal
to
the
court
of
directors
amongst
whom
thank
heaven
i
have
several
relations
and
warm
friends
and
you
will
write
i
hope
my
dear
said
revenue
board
to
sir
john
bobgrouse
who
is
the
president
of
the
board
of
control
and
whose
secretary
married
your
first
cousin
recollect
can
write
too
said
damz√®
you
may
write
to
anybody
you
please
said
revenue
board
defiantly
and
contemptuously
but
you
will
remember
that
the
point
between
us
is
this
that
even
if
your
husband
in
consequence
of
having
got
no
matter
how
a
has
the
right
to
precede
my
husband
a
civilian
of
twenty
years
standing
whether
you
have
the
right
to
precede
me
that
is
the
question
and
i
hope
revenue
dear
you
will
not
fail
to
raise
it
reader
the
question
was
submitted
in
all
its
bearings
for
the
consideration
of
the
most
noble
the
of
india
who
declining
to
take
upon
himself
so
fearful
a
responsibility
referred
the
matter
to
the
home
government
had
something
to
say
to
it
and
so
had
the
board
of
control
while
the
case
was
pending
the
newspapers
in
every
part
of
india
literally
teemed
with
letters
on
the
subject
and
their
editors
were
invited
to
give
their
opinions
thereon
only
one
of
the
number
was
weak
enough
to
do
this
and
bitterly
did
he
repent
of
his
rashness
for
having
decided
in
favour
of
the
and
of
mrs
he
lost
so
he
confessed
to
me
no
less
than
civilians
each
of
twenty
years
standing
in
his
for
more
than
eighteen
months
this
precedence
question
formed
a
leading
topic
not
only
in
the
public
prints
but
in
private
circles
it
became
in
short
a
perfect
nuisance
at
length
the
decision
of
the
home
government
came
out
to
india
but
alas
they
had
only
half
done
their
work
they
had
given
the
precedence
over
the
civilian
of
twenty
years
standing
but
had
been
silent
about
their
wives
so
the
matter
was
referred
back
a
clerk
in
the
private
secretary
office
told
me
that
he
was
occupied
for
three
hours
in
copying
only
the
minute
on
the
court
despatch
which
was
a
very
lengthy
one
and
signed
by
the
chairman
for
himself
and
the
other
directors
whose
names
were
given
in
full
he
further
informed
me
that
the
whole
of
the
documents
connected
with
this
weighty
affair
would
if
put
into
type
form
a
volume
five
times
as
bulky
as
sir
william
napier
of
how
the
matter
was
settled
eventually
i
do
not
know
for
when
i
left
india
the
question
had
not
been
decided
on
the
great
point
when
it
was
referred
for
a
second
time
to
the
home
authorities
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
court
of
directors
and
the
board
of
control
and
a
long
correspondence
ensued
on
the
subject
between
each
of
these
departments
of
the
indian
government
and
the
who
was
required
to
have
the
case
laid
before
the
of
the
supreme
courts
at
the
various
presidencies
these
gentlemen
differed
one
with
the
other
in
their
views
of
the
case
each
alleging
that
the
point
lay
in
a
nutshell
and
was
as
clear
as
possible
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
it
may
be
in
the
nutshell
at
this
moment
both
damz√®
and
revenue
board
laid
cases
before
the
calcutta
barristers
who
pocketed
their
fees
and
laconically
expressed
their
opinions
respectively
that
the
parties
who
consulted
them
were
in
the
right
there
could
be
no
doubt
on
the
point
they
said
damz√®
sent
a
copy
of
his
case
and
the
opinion
of
his
barrister
thereon
to
revenue
board
who
rather
triumphantly
returned
the
compliment
i
regret
to
say
that
this
contest
engendered
in
agra
a
great
deal
of
what
is
called
bad
blood
and
induced
many
ladies
to
descend
to
very
unseemly
personalities
for
instance
damz√®
one
evening
at
the
told
revenue
board
that
when
she
r
b
returned
to
england
she
would
have
no
rank
at
all
as
her
husband
was
not
an
esquire
even
but
a
mister
in
his
own
country
to
which
revenue
board
replied
and
you
pray
is
not
your
husband
in
the
company
service
yes
rejoined
damz√®
but
you
forget
the
let
us
now
return
to
the
honourable
lieutenant
infantry
when
that
officer
came
up
and
led
away
lady
gallopaway
to
supper
damz√®
was
overheard
to
say
i
take
the
shine
out
of
that
young
gentleman
and
if
taking
the
shine
meant
constantly
bullying
the
subaltern
damz√®
certainly
kept
his
word
and
when
the
next
hot
weather
came
and
the
lieutenant
wished
to
accompany
his
sick
wife
to
the
hills
damz√®
when
he
forwarded
the
application
for
six
months
leave
of
absence
wrote
privately
to
the
assistant
and
recommended
that
it
should
not
be
granted
the
honourable
subaltern
however
was
rather
too
strong
for
his
colonel
in
the
way
of
interest
presuming
on
the
acquaintance
which
existed
between
his
father
and
the
he
wrote
a
letter
to
that
functionary
and
a
few
days
afterwards
found
himself
in
general
orders
the
wrath
of
damz√®
may
be
easily
imagined
especially
as
he
had
boasted
to
several
of
his
officers
of
having
put
a
spoke
in
the
lieutenant
wheel
and
by
way
of
throwing
salt
upon
the
colonel
wounds
the
lieutenant
called
upon
him
and
in
the
politest
manner
possible
inquired
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
for
him
at
while
at
agra
a
bengalee
baboo
called
upon
me
judging
from
his
appearance
i
should
have
guessed
his
age
to
be
about
fifty
years
but
he
was
upwards
of
seventy
he
spoke
english
with
marvellous
fluency
and
accuracy
and
could
read
and
write
the
language
as
well
and
as
elegantly
as
any
educated
european
he
was
perhaps
the
cleverest
hindoo
whom
i
encountered
during
my
sojourn
in
the
east
his
manners
were
peculiarly
courteous
and
winning
and
there
was
an
air
of
penitence
about
the
man
which
apart
from
his
abilities
induced
me
to
treat
him
with
kindness
and
consideration
his
name
was
let
us
say
nobinkissen
the
history
of
nobinkissen
was
simply
this
he
was
a
brahmin
of
the
highest
caste
and
at
the
age
of
eighteen
was
a
writer
in
the
service
of
the
government
on
a
salary
of
ten
rupees
per
month
he
ingratiated
himself
with
every
civilian
under
whom
he
served
and
gradually
rose
step
by
step
until
he
became
the
sheristadar
or
head
clerk
of
a
of
a
court
of
appeal
in
this
office
he
acquired
riches
and
was
still
adding
to
his
store
when
his
official
career
was
brought
prematurely
to
a
close
i
must
here
inform
the
reader
that
not
one
civilian
in
a
hundred
no
matter
what
his
rank
or
grade
can
read
and
write
hindostanee
or
persian
although
the
majority
of
them
have
some
colloquial
knowledge
of
both
those
languages
yet
as
a
matter
of
course
they
append
their
signatures
to
every
document
of
which
on
hearing
it
read
aloud
to
them
by
their
native
officials
they
approve
their
orders
they
dictate
orally
those
orders
are
transcribed
by
the
sheristadar
who
gives
them
to
a
native
writer
to
copy
this
done
they
are
read
aloud
for
correction
or
approval
and
then
signed
in
english
by
the
covenanted
civilian
before
leaving
office
every
day
such
civilian
may
have
to
sign
fifty
sixty
or
a
hundred
documents
for
the
rule
is
not
to
sign
each
of
them
when
read
but
to
sign
them
in
a
mass
at
the
of
the
court
here
nobinkissen
invented
his
means
of
money
making
whenever
the
judge
gave
a
decree
in
any
case
of
importance
he
made
a
counterpart
of
such
decree
and
when
the
signing
time
came
obtained
without
any
sort
of
trouble
or
inquiry
the
signature
of
the
sahib
and
the
seal
of
the
court
to
both
documents
he
was
thus
to
all
intents
and
purposes
or
at
all
events
for
his
own
in
possession
of
something
tantamount
to
the
of
the
lands
in
dispute
he
could
arm
either
the
appellant
or
the
respondent
with
the
final
decree
of
the
court
under
the
hand
and
official
seal
of
the
judge
the
only
question
with
him
now
was
which
of
the
litigants
would
give
the
most
money
and
to
each
in
private
and
in
the
sahib
name
he
exhibited
the
documents
the
highest
bidder
of
course
gained
the
day
whereupon
nobinkissen
took
the
coin
handed
over
one
of
the
decrees
and
burnt
the
other
it
fell
out
that
nobinkissen
was
attacked
with
fever
and
in
a
state
bordering
on
delirium
he
parted
with
that
is
to
say
sold
to
both
respondent
and
appellant
a
decree
under
the
hand
and
seal
of
the
judge
such
decree
arming
the
holder
with
the
power
to
take
possession
of
a
very
large
estate
in
bengal
each
party
fearful
of
a
disturbance
which
often
occurs
when
possession
of
an
estate
is
sought
for
applied
to
the
magistrate
of
a
district
under
a
certain
regulation
of
government
for
assistance
in
order
to
enable
him
to
carry
out
the
judge
decree
which
each
as
a
matter
of
course
produced
the
magistrate
was
naturally
much
perplexed
and
made
a
reference
to
the
judge
who
could
only
say
he
had
signed
but
one
decree
there
was
then
a
report
made
to
the
government
by
the
magistrate
an
investigation
ensued
and
the
judge
was
meanwhile
suspended
for
great
suspicion
lurked
in
the
minds
of
many
that
he
was
not
so
innocent
as
he
affected
to
be
when
nobinkissen
recovered
from
his
sickness
and
saw
the
dilemma
in
which
his
superior
the
judge
was
placed
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
confessed
that
the
guilt
was
his
and
his
alone
nobinkissen
was
tried
convicted
and
sentenced
to
be
imprisoned
in
irons
for
the
term
of
his
natural
life
for
nine
years
he
was
in
the
gaol
at
alipore
near
calcutta
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
he
was
called
upon
to
furnish
some
information
of
which
he
was
possessed
in
relation
to
certain
public
affairs
he
was
brought
from
the
prison
confronted
with
several
officials
amongst
whom
was
a
member
of
the
council
his
altered
appearance
his
emaciated
form
his
attitude
of
despair
and
the
intelligence
and
readiness
with
which
he
responded
to
the
questions
put
to
him
touched
the
hearts
of
those
by
whom
he
was
examined
and
the
member
of
council
who
has
been
since
a
director
of
the
east
india
company
spoke
to
the
and
eventually
obtained
nobinkissen
pardon
and
release
the
hindoos
and
mussulmans
in
india
like
the
arabs
do
not
regard
being
guilty
of
a
fraud
or
theft
as
a
disgrace
the
degrading
part
of
the
business
is
being
convicted
and
nobinkissen
on
being
set
at
liberty
could
not
face
his
countrymen
in
bengal
and
therefore
retired
to
the
upper
provinces
where
he
lived
in
comparative
obscurity
and
in
easy
circumstances
for
he
had
not
disgorged
his
gains
his
wife
had
taken
care
of
them
during
his
captivity
at
the
time
that
nobinkissen
called
upon
me
the
government
of
india
were
in
considerable
difficulty
in
respect
to
finance
a
new
loan
had
been
opened
but
it
did
not
fill
and
the
government
had
very
wisely
determined
upon
closing
it
nobinkissen
made
this
a
topic
of
conversation
and
his
views
albeit
they
came
from
a
man
who
had
been
convicted
of
a
fraud
are
at
the
present
time
especially
entitled
to
the
very
gravest
consideration
ah
sir
he
remarked
it
is
a
pitiful
thing
that
the
government
of
a
great
empire
like
this
should
ever
be
in
pecuniary
difficulties
and
put
to
their
wits
end
for
a
few
millions
annually
in
order
to
make
the
receipts
square
with
the
expenditure
but
how
can
it
be
helped
i
asked
easily
sir
he
replied
why
not
make
it
expedient
to
do
away
with
the
perpetual
settlement
of
lord
cornwallis
and
resettle
the
whole
of
bengal
that
is
by
far
the
most
fertile
province
in
the
east
but
it
is
taxed
lighter
than
even
these
poor
lands
of
the
upper
provinces
look
at
the
durbungah
rajah
nearly
the
whole
of
tirhoot
the
garden
of
india
belongs
to
him
and
he
does
not
pay
into
the
government
treasury
half
a
lac
five
thousand
pounds
per
annum
while
his
collections
amount
to
upwards
of
twenty
lacs
these
are
the
men
who
get
hold
of
the
money
and
bury
it
and
keep
it
from
circulating
but
all
zemindarees
lands
are
not
so
profitable
in
bengal
no
many
are
not
worth
holding
especially
the
smaller
ones
although
the
land
is
just
as
good
and
just
as
well
cultivated
but
how
is
that
they
are
so
heavily
taxed
you
must
know
sir
that
in
those
days
the
days
of
lord
cornwallis
the
greatest
frauds
were
committed
in
respect
to
the
perpetual
settlement
the
natives
who
were
about
and
under
the
settlement
officers
all
made
immense
fortunes
and
the
zemindars
from
whom
they
took
their
bribes
have
profited
ever
since
to
the
cost
of
the
poorer
zemindars
who
could
not
or
would
not
bribe
and
to
the
cost
of
the
british
government
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
whole
of
the
landholders
in
bengal
would
cry
out
against
a
resettlement
of
that
province
only
men
holding
vast
tracts
of
country
at
a
comparatively
nominal
rent
would
cry
out
and
tax
the
british
government
with
a
breach
of
faith
yes
but
what
need
the
government
care
for
that
cry
especially
when
its
act
is
not
only
expedient
but
would
be
just
withal
in
bengal
all
the
great
zemindars
are
rich
very
rich
men
in
these
provinces
with
very
very
few
exceptions
they
are
poor
so
that
the
whole
of
upper
india
would
be
glad
to
see
the
perpetual
settlement
done
away
with
and
the
land
resettled
why
so
that
is
only
human
and
certainly
asiatic
nature
few
of
us
like
to
behold
our
neighbours
better
off
than
ourselves
so
that
the
cry
of
would
not
meet
with
a
response
in
this
part
of
the
world
yes
but
in
europe
the
cry
would
be
too
powerful
to
contend
against
the
exeter
hall
orators
and
the
spouters
at
the
court
of
proprietors
would
ah
sir
india
should
either
be
governed
in
india
or
in
england
it
is
the
number
of
wheels
in
the
government
that
clogs
the
movement
of
the
machine
very
true
but
who
are
these
men
these
zemindars
with
whom
you
are
required
to
keep
an
implicit
faith
are
they
your
friends
if
so
why
do
they
never
come
forward
to
assist
you
in
your
difficulties
did
a
single
zemindar
when
after
the
battle
of
ferozeshah
the
empire
was
shaking
in
the
balance
lift
a
finger
to
help
the
government
of
india
and
if
your
rule
were
at
stake
and
dependent
on
their
assistance
think
you
they
would
render
it
think
you
they
would
furnish
money
if
your
treasury
was
exhausted
not
one
pice
think
you
they
would
furnish
men
to
protect
your
stations
denuded
of
troops
no
although
hundreds
of
them
can
each
turn
out
a
thousand
or
two
of
followers
armed
with
bludgeons
swords
and
shields
when
they
desire
to
intimidate
an
european
or
to
fight
a
battle
between
themselves
about
a
boundary
question
these
are
the
men
who
in
your
greatest
need
would
remain
neutral
until
if
it
so
happened
you
were
brought
to
your
last
gasp
when
as
one
man
they
would
not
fail
to
rise
and
give
you
the
final
blow
do
you
believe
that
i
do
not
sir
i
know
my
own
countrymen
better
than
you
do
if
such
a
state
of
affairs
were
to
come
about
and
these
zemindars
remained
neutral
of
course
the
cry
of
breaking
faith
would
be
absurd
in
the
extreme
neutrality
in
such
a
case
would
be
almost
as
bad
as
hostility
nobinkissen
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
to
the
letter
our
rule
has
been
at
stake
in
imminent
peril
and
not
one
of
these
men
has
offered
to
assist
us
with
men
or
money
the
rajahs
of
durbungah
and
burdwan
alone
to
say
nothing
of
the
newab
of
moorshedabad
between
them
could
have
furnished
an
army
of
at
the
very
least
five
thousand
stalwart
whereas
they
have
looked
upon
our
difficulties
in
perfect
apathy
it
is
from
the
coffers
of
men
of
this
stamp
that
large
sums
should
be
extracted
annually
towards
keeping
up
a
vast
an
overwhelming
european
force
in
india
faith
with
such
men
as
these
what
claim
have
they
to
our
faintest
consideration
what
right
to
expect
that
we
shall
any
longer
forego
the
collection
of
several
extra
millions
annually
several
extra
millions
which
to
every
intent
and
purpose
is
our
just
due
there
is
a
line
in
shakespeare
sir
nobinkissen
continued
which
the
government
of
india
should
adopt
as
its
motto
and
act
up
to
consistently
never
does
wrong
without
just
cause
our
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
a
noise
in
the
road
i
went
to
the
window
and
observing
a
great
crowd
inquired
of
one
of
my
servants
who
was
standing
in
the
verandah
what
is
the
matter
a
bullock
has
fallen
down
and
they
are
trying
to
get
him
up
that
is
all
sahib
was
the
reply
i
rushed
to
the
spot
followed
by
nobinkissen
and
there
beheld
a
scene
which
in
no
other
country
would
have
been
tolerated
by
the
crowd
assembled
one
of
a
pair
of
bullocks
drawing
an
cart
had
from
weakness
and
fatigue
sank
beneath
the
burden
the
driver
of
the
animals
a
hindoo
had
broken
by
twisting
it
violently
the
tail
of
the
poor
beast
which
was
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
and
was
covered
with
wounds
from
heavy
blows
and
the
tail
breaking
having
failed
to
make
the
jaded
ox
stand
upon
his
legs
the
driver
heedless
of
my
remonstrance
collected
some
straw
and
sticks
and
lighted
a
fire
all
round
him
the
poor
beast
now
struggled
very
hard
but
was
unable
to
rise
and
presently
he
resigned
himself
to
be
scorched
to
death
i
always
thought
that
the
cow
was
a
sacred
animal
with
hindoos
said
i
to
nobinkissen
yes
said
he
and
here
is
a
hindoo
who
works
one
of
his
gods
till
he
drops
down
with
sheer
fatigue
and
then
cruelly
puts
him
to
death
yes
that
often
happens
said
nobinkissen
smiling
then
what
an
absurdity
and
inconsistency
for
the
hindoos
at
benares
and
other
holy
places
to
make
such
a
noise
if
an
european
only
strikes
a
sacred
animal
with
a
whip
why
it
was
only
the
other
day
that
a
mob
collected
around
the
house
of
the
magistrate
and
set
the
authorities
at
defiance
all
because
the
magistrate
had
ordered
that
one
of
the
bulls
which
crowd
the
streets
should
be
shut
up
on
the
ground
that
he
had
gored
several
people
that
is
the
doing
of
the
brahmins
who
incite
the
people
to
such
acts
and
every
concession
on
the
part
of
the
government
leads
those
brahmins
to
believe
that
they
have
great
power
and
leads
the
people
also
to
believe
it
if
a
mahommedan
finds
one
of
those
bulls
in
the
way
and
gives
him
a
thrashing
with
a
thick
stick
or
probes
him
in
the
side
with
a
sword
the
brahmins
say
nothing
nor
do
the
people
of
benares
why
is
that
because
it
would
not
be
worth
while
the
strife
would
be
profitless
for
you
see
sir
the
mahommedans
are
not
the
rulers
of
this
country
but
the
sahibs
are
and
hence
the
jealousy
with
which
they
are
watched
in
time
the
government
of
india
will
see
the
necessity
of
forbidding
hindoo
festivals
in
the
public
streets
abolishing
them
just
as
suttee
was
abolished
it
is
only
the
dissolute
rich
and
the
rabble
who
take
any
delight
in
these
festivals
many
of
which
are
indecent
and
disgusting
sensible
and
respectable
hindoos
take
no
part
in
them
on
the
contrary
they
avoid
them
and
think
them
a
nuisance
hindooism
will
never
become
extinct
so
long
as
this
world
lasts
but
the
british
government
has
the
power
of
doing
away
with
those
obnoxious
observances
in
the
public
thoroughfares
which
only
disfigure
the
religion
well
in
that
case
you
would
have
to
do
away
with
the
mahommedan
festivals
most
certainly
in
the
public
streets
in
private
the
mahommedans
as
well
as
the
hindoos
might
be
permitted
to
keep
their
festivals
in
whatever
way
they
thought
proper
do
you
suppose
that
the
mahommedans
when
in
power
suffered
the
hindoos
to
block
up
the
streets
continually
with
their
processions
as
they
do
now
think
you
that
they
entertained
the
same
consideration
for
the
bulls
and
the
monkeys
at
benares
as
the
british
now
entertain
and
when
in
turn
the
mahrattas
overran
this
part
of
the
country
think
you
that
agra
was
ever
deafened
as
it
now
is
with
the
din
of
the
buckree
ede
and
the
mohurrum
perhaps
not
but
then
you
see
nobinkissen
we
are
a
tolerant
people
and
wish
to
convince
both
creeds
that
we
have
no
desire
to
interfere
with
their
religious
prejudices
in
any
way
whatsoever
yes
but
then
you
are
inconsistent
and
the
consequence
is
that
you
not
only
get
the
credit
of
being
insincere
but
are
imposed
upon
to
the
utmost
how
inconsistent
why
you
declare
that
you
have
no
desire
to
interfere
with
the
religious
prejudices
of
the
hindoo
and
the
mahommedan
but
you
nevertheless
encourage
missionary
gentlemen
to
go
from
station
to
station
to
preach
in
the
open
air
concerning
the
superiority
of
your
religion
over
all
others
believe
me
sir
this
does
a
great
deal
of
harm
ah
but
we
make
converts
how
many
do
you
suppose
i
can
not
say
i
can
take
india
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
you
make
annually
one
out
of
fifty
thousand
no
more
no
more
sir
that
is
the
result
of
preaching
in
the
open
air
all
over
the
country
and
the
distribution
of
thousands
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
tracts
printed
in
the
hindostanee
and
bengalee
languages
well
that
is
something
nobinkissen
and
of
what
class
of
people
are
your
converts
respectable
men
of
all
classes
i
suppose
the
dregs
of
both
hindoos
and
mussulmans
the
most
debased
and
degraded
of
indians
men
who
only
assume
christianity
in
the
hope
of
temporal
advantage
and
preferment
and
who
fling
aside
their
newly
faith
and
laugh
and
scoff
at
your
credulity
the
moment
they
find
their
hope
frustrated
i
could
give
you
at
least
one
hundred
instances
but
one
will
suffice
not
long
ago
a
mussulman
named
ally
khan
was
converted
by
jones
a
missionary
in
calcutta
and
shortly
after
his
conversion
obtained
an
appointment
with
a
salary
of
one
hundred
rupees
a
month
in
the
baptist
missionary
society
here
he
contrived
to
embezzle
sixteen
hundred
rupees
for
which
offence
he
was
indicted
in
the
supreme
court
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
a
year
imprisonment
in
the
calcutta
gaol
on
hearing
the
sentence
he
exclaimed
the
name
of
the
devil
is
this
the
reward
of
renouncing
my
religion
farewell
christianity
from
this
hour
i
am
a
moslem
again
another
very
flagrant
case
occurred
in
this
very
station
a
civilian
took
into
his
service
a
recently
converted
hindoo
as
a
the
fellow
had
charge
of
a
and
ran
off
with
it
and
where
and
how
do
you
suppose
he
was
apprehended
at
hurdwar
taking
an
active
part
in
the
hoolee
festival
the
roman
catholic
priests
have
long
since
left
off
asking
the
natives
of
india
to
become
christians
those
who
voluntarily
present
themselves
are
after
a
strict
examination
and
a
due
warning
that
they
must
hope
for
no
temporal
advantage
admitted
into
the
church
and
do
they
have
any
applications
very
very
few
indeed
but
those
whom
they
admit
do
really
and
truly
become
christians
these
last
words
of
nobinkissen
were
scarcely
pronounced
when
a
palkee
was
brought
up
to
my
door
and
out
of
it
stepped
a
roman
catholic
priest
an
italian
gentleman
a
jesuit
whom
i
had
met
a
few
evenings
previously
at
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
nobinkissen
who
appeared
to
know
the
reverend
father
intimately
related
to
him
the
substance
of
the
conversation
we
had
just
held
or
rather
the
latter
part
thereof
and
the
priest
corroborated
every
allegation
that
nobinkissen
had
made
yea
he
added
we
now
devote
our
attention
exclusively
to
the
spiritual
wants
of
the
white
man
who
requires
our
aid
convinced
as
we
are
of
the
hopelessness
of
the
task
of
converting
the
hindoo
and
the
mussulman
to
christianity
and
in
addition
to
the
instances
of
false
converts
afforded
by
nobinkissen
he
did
not
scruple
to
detail
several
others
of
an
equally
atrocious
character
and
complexion
the
upper
provinces
having
seen
agra
its
edifices
ruins
society
european
and
native
and
having
visited
secundra
futteypore
sickri
and
muttra
i
journeyed
upwards
to
delhi
where
i
was
received
by
joseph
skinner
the
eldest
son
of
the
late
colonel
skinner
renowned
as
the
founder
and
commandant
of
the
famous
skinner
horse
joseph
skinner
house
was
at
all
times
open
to
all
travellers
he
was
without
exception
the
most
hospitable
man
that
i
ever
met
in
any
part
of
the
world
at
his
board
were
to
be
met
daily
either
at
luncheon
or
at
dinner
civilians
and
military
men
of
every
rank
and
grade
in
the
service
as
well
as
native
gentlemen
of
position
in
india
hindoos
and
mahommedans
even
the
young
princes
sons
of
the
king
of
delhi
and
descendants
of
the
great
moghul
used
frequently
to
honour
skinner
with
their
company
the
title
by
which
they
were
usually
greeted
was
signifying
lords
of
the
world
but
the
most
remarkable
native
that
i
ever
met
at
skinner
hospitable
board
was
the
late
maharajah
a
little
fat
round
mahratta
chieftain
with
small
twinkling
eyes
and
a
countenance
replete
with
fun
and
quiet
humour
he
was
a
pensioner
of
the
gwalior
state
and
drew
therefrom
twelve
thousand
pounds
a
year
which
was
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
british
government
large
as
was
this
income
contrived
annually
to
spend
more
than
double
the
amount
trusting
continually
to
fate
to
relieve
him
from
his
pressing
pecuniary
difficulties
not
that
he
ever
suffered
them
to
prey
upon
his
mind
on
the
contrary
he
made
them
a
subject
of
jocularity
in
addition
to
being
as
hospitable
as
his
friend
skinner
was
addicted
to
field
sports
on
a
large
scale
and
kept
up
a
very
large
establishment
for
the
purpose
of
gratifying
this
propensity
he
was
considered
and
perhaps
justly
by
those
qualified
to
form
an
opinion
the
best
shot
in
all
india
and
with
his
rifle
he
had
destroyed
several
hundreds
some
say
thousands
of
tigers
had
another
very
expensive
hobby
he
desired
to
possess
himself
of
the
philosopher
stone
by
which
he
might
transmute
metals
a
mode
by
which
he
proposed
to
improve
the
state
of
his
finances
and
eventually
pay
his
debts
on
all
other
points
was
sufficiently
sensible
and
shrewd
but
on
this
point
he
was
childish
if
not
insane
thousands
and
thousands
of
pounds
were
squandered
by
him
in
this
absurd
pursuit
for
he
was
constantly
the
victim
of
juggling
forgers
swindlers
and
rogues
his
house
was
on
a
hill
immediately
overhanging
delhi
and
it
has
recently
been
made
famous
throughout
europe
as
the
position
of
one
of
our
batteries
night
after
night
in
that
house
would
furnaces
blaze
while
some
impostor
who
pretended
to
have
the
secret
was
at
work
with
his
chemicals
i
ought
to
mention
that
this
mahratta
chief
was
a
near
relation
of
the
royal
family
of
gwalior
and
that
he
had
been
banished
and
pensioned
for
having
been
engaged
in
some
intrigues
against
the
gwalior
state
the
maharajah
was
a
great
gourmand
and
those
who
partook
of
his
dinners
never
forgot
them
it
was
not
often
that
the
old
chief
could
be
induced
to
discuss
politics
but
on
the
occasion
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
having
mutinied
at
delhi
a
mutiny
which
by
the
way
was
hushed
up
i
heard
him
very
energetically
exclaim
ah
if
you
go
on
humouring
your
native
soldiers
in
this
way
they
will
never
be
satisfied
until
they
govern
the
country
the
late
sir
charles
james
napier
visited
delhi
while
i
was
there
he
came
not
as
ordinary
usually
come
with
a
large
suite
and
an
escort
covering
a
square
mile
of
encamping
ground
but
attended
only
by
two
and
a
military
secretary
it
was
on
the
morning
of
his
excellency
arrival
that
the
mutiny
in
the
regiment
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
occurred
sir
charles
reviewed
the
regiments
then
quartered
at
delhi
including
the
and
complimented
them
the
review
over
who
was
a
great
horseman
rode
up
to
the
on
his
spirited
charger
and
expressed
the
happiness
it
afforded
him
to
see
an
officer
who
had
so
distinguished
himself
in
the
military
annals
of
his
country
sir
charles
appeared
much
pleased
with
the
open
frank
manner
and
independent
bearing
of
the
old
mahratta
chieftain
and
accepted
on
behalf
of
himself
and
his
staff
an
invitation
to
dine
with
him
that
evening
a
large
number
of
gentlemen
european
and
native
assembled
to
meet
his
excellency
and
when
sir
charles
returned
thanks
for
the
honour
that
had
been
paid
to
him
in
drinking
his
health
he
made
allusion
to
the
pleasure
that
it
afforded
him
in
seeing
christians
hindoos
and
mussulmen
on
such
good
terms
and
living
together
in
such
amity
and
concord
what
a
change
since
that
evening
which
to
me
seems
but
as
yesterday
several
of
our
party
on
that
occasion
have
become
chiefs
of
the
recent
rebellion
and
were
accessory
to
the
massacre
of
english
gentlemen
and
ladies
died
in
eighteen
hundred
and
his
funeral
was
thus
described
to
me
by
a
friend
who
witnessed
it
they
dressed
up
the
old
gentleman
corpse
in
his
most
magnificent
costume
covered
his
arms
with
jewelled
bracelets
of
gold
with
costly
necklaces
of
pearls
and
diamonds
hanging
down
to
his
waist
placed
him
in
a
chair
of
state
sat
him
bolt
upright
just
as
he
used
to
sit
when
alive
and
thus
attended
by
his
relations
friends
and
suite
he
was
carried
through
delhi
to
the
banks
of
the
jumna
where
the
body
was
burnt
with
the
usual
rites
and
the
ashes
thrown
into
the
river
skinner
also
is
dead
he
died
in
eighteen
hundred
and
when
i
think
of
him
i
am
rejoiced
that
he
did
not
survive
to
be
brutally
massacred
as
his
brothers
have
been
or
to
see
his
house
near
the
cashmere
gate
which
was
always
the
scene
of
and
turned
into
a
battery
by
the
rebels
or
the
church
built
by
his
father
burned
and
destroyed
by
the
people
who
had
for
years
and
years
paid
or
affected
to
pay
unqualified
respect
and
devotion
to
his
family
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
another
personage
at
delhi
for
whom
i
had
a
very
great
liking
and
regard
this
was
mirza
futteh
allee
shah
bahadoor
the
heir
apparent
to
the
throne
of
delhi
he
was
a
very
amiable
and
intelligent
prince
and
had
an
extraordinary
thirst
for
knowledge
amongst
other
things
that
he
was
curious
to
learn
was
the
history
of
steam
power
railroads
and
the
electric
telegraph
for
hours
together
he
would
encourage
me
nay
importune
me
to
talk
with
him
on
these
matters
of
this
prince
and
his
family
while
i
was
at
delhi
the
festival
of
the
eed
came
to
pass
and
there
was
an
omen
which
was
variously
interpreted
the
king
in
other
words
the
great
moghul
sacrifices
a
camel
the
king
kills
or
used
to
kill
the
camel
with
his
own
hand
by
driving
a
spear
into
the
breast
of
the
animal
on
the
occasion
to
which
i
now
refer
the
king
being
extremely
old
and
feeble
was
assisted
by
two
attendants
and
in
attempting
to
drive
the
spear
it
broke
in
two
pieces
that
was
the
omen
the
friends
of
mirza
futteh
allee
shah
bahadoor
interpreted
it
as
prognosticating
the
king
death
and
the
speedy
succession
of
the
heir
apparent
to
the
throne
others
however
said
that
it
prognosticated
the
downfall
of
the
king
and
of
his
throne
for
ever
mirza
died
about
a
year
ago
of
an
attack
of
cholera
and
it
may
not
be
premature
perhaps
to
say
that
the
throne
of
the
great
moghul
will
not
in
future
be
recognised
there
was
another
curious
prophecy
connected
with
the
throne
of
delhi
and
current
for
many
years
in
the
punjab
it
was
implicitly
believed
that
the
sikh
soldiery
would
one
day
or
other
and
before
long
sack
delhi
and
in
eighteen
hundred
and
when
the
sikh
army
crossed
our
frontier
delhi
was
its
destination
this
prophecy
has
to
some
extent
been
fulfilled
the
sikh
soldiers
have
tasted
of
the
plunder
of
delhi
but
who
could
ever
have
dreamed
that
their
entry
into
the
city
of
the
great
moghul
would
be
in
company
with
british
soldiers
it
is
as
though
and
quite
as
incredible
as
if
some
one
had
predicted
in
eighteen
hundred
and
sixteen
that
in
eighteen
hundred
and
the
queen
of
england
a
of
george
would
be
a
guest
at
the
tuileries
of
an
emperor
of
the
french
and
a
nephew
of
napoleon
bonaparte
and
that
such
queen
would
be
led
upon
the
arm
of
such
emperor
to
visit
the
tomb
of
the
prisoner
of
helena
after
leaving
delhi
i
crossed
over
to
meerut
which
was
then
as
it
always
has
been
since
its
formation
the
favourite
station
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
in
eighteen
hundred
and
and
there
were
as
many
as
ten
thousand
troops
quartered
at
meerut
including
two
regiments
of
british
foot
a
regiment
of
dragoons
and
three
troops
of
horse
european
artillery
until
lately
it
has
always
been
deemed
prudent
to
keep
a
very
large
european
force
at
meerut
in
order
to
keep
delhi
only
forty
miles
distant
in
check
for
it
was
stipulated
in
one
of
our
treaties
with
the
family
of
the
moghuls
that
no
british
infantry
or
cavalry
or
other
european
troops
should
ever
be
quartered
in
the
imperial
city
or
its
immediate
vicinity
when
however
the
punjab
was
annexed
the
european
force
at
meerut
was
lessened
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
the
times
and
of
late
meerut
has
not
been
in
respect
to
the
number
of
european
troops
the
station
that
it
was
formerly
there
are
no
ancient
buildings
to
be
seen
at
meerut
all
is
of
european
structure
the
church
the
barracks
the
the
treasury
the
theatre
the
bungalows
of
the
civilians
and
military
officers
as
well
as
those
of
the
merchants
and
others
are
all
of
brick
and
mortar
lath
and
plaster
and
they
were
for
the
most
part
thatched
so
that
the
sepoys
had
very
little
trouble
in
setting
fire
to
them
the
reason
why
houses
are
commonly
thatched
instead
of
tiled
and
shingled
is
that
the
thatch
keeps
the
interior
of
the
dwelling
so
very
much
cooler
while
at
meerut
i
was
a
guest
of
the
editor
of
the
journal
which
used
to
issue
from
that
station
and
as
my
stay
extended
over
six
weeks
during
which
period
i
frequently
assisted
the
editor
in
his
work
i
gained
some
knowledge
of
the
practical
working
of
the
press
in
the
upper
provinces
i
am
authorized
to
make
any
use
i
please
of
this
knowledge
in
the
first
place
i
may
mention
that
the
order
of
government
forbidding
civilians
or
military
men
corresponding
with
the
press
was
to
every
intent
and
purpose
a
perfect
farce
and
a
dead
letter
on
the
staff
of
the
meerut
paper
were
several
gentlemen
belonging
to
each
branch
of
the
service
these
gentlemen
not
only
wrote
but
some
of
them
wrote
for
pay
for
so
much
per
column
while
the
correspondence
columns
were
filled
with
letters
from
covenanted
civilians
or
commissioned
officers
judges
and
magistrates
and
their
subordinates
brigadiers
colonels
majors
captains
and
subalterns
contributed
anonymously
whenever
the
spirit
moved
them
ay
and
frequently
the
members
of
the
staff
of
the
and
of
the
would
not
only
send
items
of
news
but
comments
thereon
and
i
have
reason
to
know
that
this
practice
was
continued
up
to
the
date
of
the
recent
outbreak
and
is
still
continued
by
the
way
the
late
major
thomas
was
virtually
the
editor
of
the
at
agra
at
the
time
he
received
his
death
wound
in
the
field
of
battle
the
delhi
newspaper
was
also
written
for
by
civilians
and
military
men
of
all
grades
it
was
the
press
that
introduced
to
the
notice
of
the
government
many
clever
and
able
men
who
had
no
other
interest
to
help
them
i
could
mention
scores
of
instances
but
two
will
suffice
herbert
benjamin
edwardes
of
the
bengal
fusiliers
the
brahminee
bull
of
the
and
campbell
of
the
civil
service
who
was
given
up
to
lord
dalhousie
as
the
delator
of
the
and
promoted
to
an
office
of
great
responsibility
in
the
paper
there
also
appeared
in
eighteen
hundred
and
and
forty
nine
a
series
of
leading
articles
on
military
reform
and
other
matters
some
of
which
attracted
the
notice
of
sir
charles
napier
they
came
from
the
pen
of
general
then
major
mansfield
of
the
foot
and
at
present
chief
of
the
staff
of
sir
colin
campbell
it
was
not
to
silence
these
men
who
displayed
their
ability
in
the
newspapers
that
they
were
placed
in
staff
employ
or
promoted
on
the
contrary
i
know
that
they
were
expected
and
in
some
instances
requested
to
use
their
pens
in
defence
of
certain
government
measures
and
that
on
several
occasions
they
did
vigorous
battle
with
their
former
literary
chief
the
editor
of
the
paper
in
which
they
first
made
their
appearance
in
print
i
remember
that
on
one
occasion
the
editor
on
being
beaten
in
an
argument
headed
his
admission
of
the
fact
with
the
following
lines
keen
are
our
pangs
but
keener
far
to
feel
we
nursed
the
pinion
that
impels
the
steel
there
are
no
newsmen
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
nor
indeed
in
any
of
the
presidencies
whoever
wishes
to
take
a
journal
must
subscribe
for
a
certain
period
year
or
the
rates
for
the
or
were
three
pounds
twelve
shillings
per
annum
or
two
pounds
per
six
months
the
net
profits
of
both
these
papers
in
eighteen
hundred
and
and
fifty
were
upwards
of
five
thousand
pounds
per
annum
with
the
exception
of
the
in
when
under
the
control
of
its
original
proprietor
these
journals
of
the
were
by
far
the
most
remunerative
of
any
in
the
east
there
was
a
native
newspaper
published
at
meerut
called
the
which
title
signifies
a
bowl
or
glass
into
which
if
you
look
you
will
see
what
transpires
in
the
whole
world
the
history
of
this
paper
is
very
curious
it
was
founded
without
the
knowledge
privity
or
consent
of
the
conductor
of
the
european
journal
by
the
head
pressman
of
his
establishment
who
was
a
brahmin
the
editor
of
this
native
print
which
was
lithographed
in
the
oordoo
language
was
the
moonshee
of
the
english
press
at
meerut
he
was
well
skilled
in
english
and
his
chief
employment
was
translating
the
native
correspondence
having
constant
access
to
the
desks
of
the
compositors
this
press
moonshee
acquired
a
knowledge
of
every
item
of
news
furnished
by
european
as
well
as
native
correspondents
and
of
this
knowledge
he
failed
not
to
avail
himself
this
however
was
but
a
small
evil
comparatively
unknown
to
the
conductor
of
the
meerut
paper
a
much
greater
evil
arose
from
the
publication
of
the
native
print
availing
himself
of
such
sources
of
information
its
editor
seized
the
views
of
his
employer
views
intended
only
for
european
eyes
and
gave
his
own
version
of
them
to
his
readers
in
the
hindoostanee
language
and
what
was
equally
mischievous
he
published
quantities
of
matter
which
the
conductor
of
the
meerut
paper
thought
proper
to
suppress
after
it
was
set
up
in
type
these
were
the
morsels
in
which
the
native
editor
took
most
delight
a
single
instance
will
suffice
the
following
appeared
in
the
leading
columns
of
the
the
facts
having
been
kept
out
of
the
columns
of
the
meerut
paper
at
the
instance
of
the
friends
of
the
gentleman
who
was
guilty
of
the
indiscretion
an
act
of
retributive
justice
has
just
been
committed
by
the
worthy
magistrate
of
this
district
it
was
supposed
that
an
escaped
convict
from
the
jail
was
secreted
in
a
village
about
four
miles
distant
from
this
cantonment
in
the
dead
of
the
night
the
magistrate
at
the
head
of
a
large
body
of
police
visited
the
village
aroused
the
inhabitants
from
their
slumbers
and
demanded
the
culprit
the
villagers
denied
any
knowledge
of
him
the
magistrate
with
characteristic
kindness
and
consideration
gave
them
to
make
up
their
minds
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
as
the
culprit
was
not
produced
he
set
fire
to
the
village
in
those
flames
which
illuminated
the
country
for
miles
round
thirteen
lives
were
sacrificed
namely
those
of
three
men
four
women
and
six
children
one
of
the
unfortunate
women
was
in
labour
at
the
time
some
malicious
natives
in
the
neighbourhood
of
meerut
give
out
that
the
sahib
has
been
notoriously
mad
for
several
years
past
let
us
hope
however
that
the
will
not
heed
such
insinuations
but
after
complimenting
the
magistrate
on
his
vigour
and
his
zeal
appoint
him
to
the
first
judgeship
that
may
become
vacant
no
less
than
six
hundred
persons
are
by
this
fire
rendered
homeless
beggars
but
what
of
that
must
justice
be
obstructed
it
remains
for
us
to
add
that
the
escaped
convict
of
whom
the
magistrate
was
in
search
has
been
in
oude
for
the
past
month
and
that
no
notice
of
this
affair
will
appear
in
any
of
the
papers
printed
in
english
and
edited
by
the
sahib
logue
those
gentlemen
are
far
too
modest
to
make
known
the
manifest
blessings
which
arise
out
of
british
rule
in
india
for
upwards
of
a
year
and
the
native
paper
went
on
filching
news
and
writing
in
the
above
strain
at
length
the
conductor
of
the
meerut
journal
was
furnished
with
some
information
which
led
to
his
discharging
his
employ√©es
the
head
pressman
and
the
moonshee
and
breaking
up
their
journal
the
and
more
than
this
was
done
the
danger
of
permitting
native
newspapers
to
be
published
without
any
sort
of
supervision
was
elaborately
and
from
time
to
time
dwelt
upon
by
the
english
editor
and
at
length
the
government
was
moved
to
call
for
a
return
of
the
journals
printed
in
the
hindoostanee
language
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
and
for
an
account
of
the
number
of
copies
that
each
issued
with
this
return
and
account
the
government
was
well
satisfied
first
because
the
aggregate
circulation
was
so
ridiculously
small
comparatively
that
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
native
press
had
no
power
or
influence
and
secondly
that
the
tone
of
the
best
conducted
and
most
respectable
journals
of
the
native
press
were
loud
in
their
praises
of
british
rule
and
firm
supporters
of
the
government
it
was
overlooked
with
reference
to
the
first
point
that
in
no
country
and
in
india
especially
is
the
actual
circulation
of
a
newspaper
any
criterion
of
the
number
of
persons
acquainted
with
its
contents
its
chief
items
of
intelligence
and
its
sentiments
on
the
most
important
questions
of
the
day
let
us
take
for
example
the
greatest
paper
in
the
world
the
compare
the
number
of
copies
that
are
struck
off
daily
with
the
number
of
hands
into
which
that
paper
passes
the
number
of
eyes
that
read
it
and
the
number
of
ears
that
listen
to
hear
it
read
as
to
the
second
point
the
praise
of
the
government
of
india
it
was
laughable
to
hear
it
mentioned
albeit
the
subject
was
of
so
serious
a
character
that
praise
was
bestowed
very
much
in
the
same
spirit
that
jack
wilkes
is
said
to
have
conveyed
a
serious
warning
with
a
humorous
grin
to
an
election
mob
i
hear
that
it
is
your
intention
gentlemen
to
take
that
person
there
who
is
interrupting
me
place
him
under
that
pump
and
duck
him
now
if
you
should
do
so
no
matter
how
much
it
may
be
for
his
own
good
you
will
i
give
you
this
emphatic
warning
incur
my
most
serious
displeasure
gentlemen
they
the
native
editors
used
to
wrap
up
the
most
bitter
irony
in
the
most
complimentary
phrases
and
frequently
their
allusions
if
viewed
abstractedly
were
both
humorous
and
witty
a
case
in
point
the
late
of
the
provinces
a
few
years
ago
presided
at
an
examination
of
the
students
of
a
government
public
school
amongst
other
questions
which
his
honour
put
to
the
boys
of
the
first
class
was
this
how
does
the
world
go
round
the
head
boy
a
very
intelligent
hindoo
gave
an
admirable
reply
spoke
as
the
saying
is
like
a
book
the
editor
of
a
native
paper
in
a
notice
of
the
examination
predicted
that
this
boy
would
come
to
a
bad
end
for
giving
such
an
answer
to
the
of
the
provinces
he
ought
said
the
native
editor
when
so
questioned
by
so
potent
a
ruler
as
to
the
cause
of
the
going
round
to
have
flung
science
into
the
gutter
and
having
assumed
the
most
cringing
attitude
imaginable
he
should
have
placed
his
hands
together
and
then
have
responded
meekly
your
honour
grace
favour
and
kindness
does
this
planet
revolve
upon
its
axis
this
same
editor
once
wrote
a
notice
of
a
ball
given
by
the
officers
of
the
horse
artillery
mess
at
meerut
to
the
ladies
of
the
foot
on
the
occasion
of
that
and
distinguished
regiment
coming
to
the
station
when
translated
literally
to
an
englishman
this
notice
would
seem
the
most
flattering
account
possible
but
if
such
englishman
took
it
in
the
sense
in
which
asiatics
understood
and
comprehended
it
he
would
without
any
sort
of
doubt
have
admitted
that
it
was
the
most
extraordinary
and
ingenious
admixture
of
satire
and
obscenity
that
ever
was
printed
and
published
the
same
editor
during
the
second
sikh
campaign
burlesqued
the
despatches
of
lord
gough
but
so
cleverly
that
they
were
taken
by
english
people
who
heard
them
translated
as
genuine
productions
this
was
the
man
who
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
bringing
british
rule
in
india
into
disgrace
ridicule
and
contempt
amongst
his
countrymen
and
who
eventually
by
producing
his
writings
and
having
them
translated
literally
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
appointment
under
the
government
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
per
mensem
the
great
article
on
which
his
good
fortune
was
based
was
one
descriptive
of
lord
dalhousie
on
the
back
of
an
elephant
proceeding
to
a
spot
appointed
as
the
place
of
an
interview
between
his
lordship
and
the
late
maharajah
goolab
singh
neither
the
london
nor
the
paris
ever
surpassed
this
squib
so
far
as
its
spirit
of
ridicule
was
concerned
while
in
point
of
mischief
those
european
journals
of
fun
would
never
have
dreamed
of
going
the
lengths
of
the
asiatic
writer
what
became
of
this
native
editor
may
be
reasonably
asked
i
hear
that
he
is
now
and
military
secretary
to
bahadoor
khan
the
rebel
who
is
at
the
head
of
a
considerable
army
and
according
to
the
latest
accounts
in
possession
of
the
entire
bareilly
district
he
the
native
editor
is
a
mahommedan
of
very
ancient
and
good
family
he
has
an
extremely
handsome
person
and
plausible
manners
and
should
i
again
wander
in
india
it
will
not
at
all
surprise
me
to
find
him
in
the
service
of
the
british
government
and
filling
some
office
of
considerable
dignity
and
emolument
i
have
incidentally
spoken
of
the
theatre
at
meerut
it
was
a
building
about
the
size
of
the
adelphi
theatre
and
was
built
by
subscription
some
years
ago
the
performers
were
of
course
amateurs
officers
in
the
civil
and
military
services
and
now
and
then
an
interloper
possessed
of
histrionic
abilities
the
ladies
were
those
young
gentlemen
who
could
be
best
made
up
to
imitate
the
gentler
sex
the
prompters
and
so
on
were
men
belonging
to
the
various
european
corps
quartered
in
the
station
men
who
had
been
about
or
connected
with
london
theatres
and
who
understood
their
business
thoroughly
on
an
average
there
was
a
performance
once
a
fortnight
tragedy
was
seldom
or
never
attempted
nothing
but
standard
comedies
and
approved
farces
it
pains
me
to
think
of
the
last
performance
i
witnessed
on
the
meerut
boards
for
with
the
exception
of
myself
and
another
gentleman
every
one
who
had
a
character
assigned
to
him
is
now
numbered
with
the
dead
the
play
was
lady
of
claude
melnotte
was
an
officer
in
the
his
height
was
under
five
feet
and
his
weight
exactly
eight
stone
pauline
was
the
magistrate
of
who
was
six
feet
three
and
weighed
stone
and
some
pounds
in
short
claude
was
about
the
smallest
and
pauline
about
the
biggest
man
in
british
india
these
two
died
of
natural
causes
within
the
last
three
years
the
rest
have
all
been
massacred
or
killed
in
action
some
perished
at
cawnpore
and
other
stations
and
some
have
fallen
before
delhi
and
before
lucknow
and
alas
amongst
the
audience
of
that
night
how
many
have
since
been
prematurely
despatched
from
this
world
men
women
and
children
there
are
some
matters
connected
with
theatricals
in
india
in
the
upper
provinces
which
would
strike
any
gentleman
or
lady
fresh
from
europe
as
very
odd
huge
punkahs
are
suspended
from
the
ceiling
and
pulled
by
natives
during
the
performance
without
the
punkahs
the
heat
in
the
house
would
be
unbearable
then
there
are
no
boxes
and
there
is
no
pit
one
part
of
the
house
that
nearest
to
the
stage
is
set
apart
for
the
officers
civil
and
military
and
their
wives
and
families
the
rest
of
the
house
is
generally
filled
by
officers
and
private
soldiers
as
a
matter
of
course
the
greatest
order
prevails
throughout
the
play
which
is
usually
produced
under
the
patronage
of
the
officer
commanding
the
station
and
his
lady
the
actors
are
never
hissed
but
the
applause
in
which
the
men
always
join
is
loud
long
frequent
and
encouraging
in
most
of
the
large
stations
where
european
troops
are
quartered
such
stations
as
meerut
agra
umballah
cawnpore
lahore
the
officers
and
men
of
the
regiments
get
up
theatrical
performances
which
are
attended
by
the
society
and
very
creditably
too
do
they
perform
i
have
seen
a
sergeant
of
the
foot
colonel
greathead
regiment
play
at
agra
the
character
of
doctor
in
irish
in
a
style
and
with
a
racy
humour
which
reminded
me
more
of
the
late
power
than
any
actor
on
the
metropolitan
or
provincial
boards
in
england
ever
did
and
at
umballah
i
have
seen
a
corporal
of
the
third
dragoons
act
the
part
of
in
a
way
that
moved
an
audience
unused
albeit
to
the
melting
mood
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
phrase
to
involuntary
tears
but
by
far
the
best
actor
i
am
speaking
of
that
i
ever
listened
to
considering
the
range
of
characters
that
he
played
was
a
private
in
the
lancers
i
would
have
gone
night
after
night
to
see
him
in
tragedy
comedy
or
farce
or
even
to
hear
him
sing
a
sentimental
or
a
comic
song
he
was
a
younger
brother
of
an
intelligent
influential
rich
and
deservedly
respected
london
tradesman
whose
name
is
known
in
every
quarter
of
the
world
where
the
english
language
is
spoken
it
behoves
me
to
say
that
these
three
men
who
by
the
way
are
all
dead
were
possessed
of
great
general
ability
and
had
respectively
received
a
good
education
it
is
not
for
a
wanderer
and
an
interloper
like
myself
to
make
any
suggestions
to
an
enlightened
i
use
the
word
advisedly
government
but
i
do
hope
that
when
order
is
restored
throughout
our
eastern
dominions
when
the
affairs
of
the
country
are
a
matter
of
local
consideration
the
health
comfort
and
recreation
of
the
british
soldier
in
those
hot
plains
will
command
more
attention
than
has
hitherto
been
bestowed
upon
them
i
hope
to
see
barracks
in
which
the
men
can
live
in
comparative
comfort
barracks
lofty
and
spacious
and
fitted
with
punkahs
and
other
conveniences
such
as
are
required
for
the
climate
and
such
as
one
always
finds
in
the
abodes
of
officers
and
gentlemen
i
hope
to
see
separate
sleeping
apartments
for
the
married
couples
and
separate
sleeping
apartments
for
the
mass
of
children
above
seven
and
eight
years
of
age
i
hope
never
again
to
see
men
women
young
girls
and
boys
and
infant
children
so
huddled
together
that
those
who
escaped
demoralization
ought
to
have
been
exhibited
as
curiosities
of
the
human
species
i
hope
never
again
to
behold
white
children
girls
of
thirteen
years
of
age
the
offspring
of
british
soldiers
married
in
order
that
they
might
remain
in
the
regiment
surely
i
once
remarked
to
the
colonel
of
a
royal
regiment
in
india
who
made
some
remarks
on
the
painful
topic
last
alluded
to
surely
this
might
be
obviated
yes
my
good
sir
was
his
reply
but
it
would
cost
this
government
an
outlay
of
a
few
thousands
of
rupees
a
little
while
ago
i
had
a
battle
with
the
government
i
insisted
on
having
punkahs
hung
up
in
the
barracks
and
i
spoke
in
a
tone
so
decided
that
even
the
frowsy
military
board
composed
of
several
very
old
and
feeble
officers
of
the
last
century
was
frightened
into
something
like
activity
well
sir
the
punkahs
were
suspended
and
i
fancied
that
i
had
gained
an
immense
triumph
but
i
was
very
much
mistaken
it
was
a
case
of
are
your
punkahs
and
now
let
your
men
pull
them
or
employ
the
natives
to
do
so
so
that
the
punkahs
after
all
instead
of
promoting
a
current
of
fresh
air
impeded
it
and
served
only
as
perches
for
the
flies
and
for
the
spiders
the
idea
of
the
poor
men
paying
for
punkah
coolies
what
would
it
cost
to
punkah
the
whole
regiment
during
the
hot
season
i
asked
i
can
tell
you
exactly
said
the
colonel
for
i
have
made
a
correct
estimate
the
cost
for
the
five
hot
months
would
be
under
three
hundred
pounds
and
by
laying
out
this
sum
the
government
would
save
some
three
thousand
or
four
thousand
pounds
at
the
very
least
how
so
many
men
can
not
bear
the
heat
of
these
barrack
rooms
crowded
as
they
are
and
left
without
punkahs
the
consequence
is
that
they
become
ill
go
into
hospital
and
die
there
or
spend
the
greater
part
of
their
time
there
i
should
say
that
if
the
men
had
better
accommodation
and
the
same
means
as
have
of
keeping
their
apartments
cool
we
should
save
in
every
regiment
fifty
lives
annually
now
every
recruit
who
comes
from
home
and
joins
a
regiment
in
the
upper
provinces
to
fill
up
a
death
or
casualty
in
the
ranks
costs
the
indian
government
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
sterling
i
have
pointed
all
this
out
but
it
is
of
no
use
i
would
report
it
to
the
horse
guards
said
i
i
did
so
two
years
ago
and
what
did
the
horse
guards
say
in
reply
to
your
statements
precisely
what
the
learned
world
said
of
poor
george
paradoxes
they
said
nothing
they
treated
them
with
dignified
silence
and
perhaps
contempt
however
i
did
not
stop
there
i
went
further
you
addressed
the
throne
or
prince
albert
no
i
did
not
go
so
far
as
that
we
had
just
got
the
albert
hat
out
and
after
a
careful
examination
of
it
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
royal
highness
would
hardly
be
disposed
to
give
much
ear
to
my
complaint
touching
the
discomfort
of
the
british
troops
in
india
but
i
wrote
to
an
elder
brother
of
mine
who
represents
a
borough
in
parliament
and
i
begged
of
him
to
bring
under
the
notice
of
the
house
of
commons
the
condition
of
the
british
soldier
in
india
and
move
for
a
report
of
the
officers
in
command
of
the
various
regiments
doing
duty
in
this
country
and
he
did
so
i
hope
not
he
he
wrote
to
me
to
say
that
he
had
never
spoken
in
the
house
and
never
intended
doing
so
as
he
had
not
the
faintest
ambition
to
become
a
public
orator
but
that
he
had
shown
my
letter
to
several
friends
of
his
members
of
parliament
who
would
only
be
too
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
bringing
themselves
into
notice
and
that
they
one
and
all
blew
upon
it
remarking
that
the
condition
of
the
british
soldier
in
any
part
of
the
world
was
a
frightful
bore
but
that
the
condition
of
the
british
soldier
in
the
east
was
a
bore
utterly
beyond
toleration
dear
george
he
went
on
to
say
to
me
story
would
only
be
received
with
an
ironical
hear
hear
followed
by
a
series
of
coughs
as
though
the
subject
had
given
the
house
a
sudden
chill
and
a
very
bad
cold
even
that
garrulous
goose
jamsey
to
whom
in
despair
and
in
order
to
oblige
you
i
showed
your
letter
even
jamsey
who
is
always
ready
to
talk
for
hours
about
everything
or
anybody
shrugged
his
shoulders
shook
his
head
sighed
lifted
up
his
hands
groaned
wo
and
left
me
find
out
some
who
has
been
or
is
supposed
to
be
guilty
of
some
sort
of
oppression
towards
a
sable
cultivator
of
the
soil
and
we
will
pretty
soon
grind
his
bones
to
make
our
bread
my
boy
but
for
heaven
sake
and
the
sake
of
the
house
of
commons
do
inflict
upon
us
your
british
soldiers
to
leave
the
colonel
and
express
my
further
hopes
i
hope
to
see
in
every
large
station
throughout
india
two
christian
churches
erected
one
for
the
protestants
and
another
for
the
roman
catholics
both
erected
at
the
expense
of
the
government
i
hope
to
see
also
in
every
large
station
a
library
to
which
every
soldier
at
stated
hours
shall
have
access
i
hope
to
see
soldiers
gardens
such
as
the
late
sir
henry
lawrence
recommended
in
which
the
men
may
when
they
feel
disposed
work
or
amuse
themselves
in
the
cold
season
i
hope
to
see
a
theatre
in
every
large
station
built
and
kept
in
repair
not
by
subscription
from
the
poor
men
but
at
the
cost
of
the
state
i
hope
in
fact
to
see
the
british
soldier
in
the
east
not
petted
pampered
and
made
a
fuss
of
but
made
as
sensibly
comfortable
as
the
climate
in
which
he
serves
will
admit
of
his
being
made
i
hope
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
never
to
see
brave
men
put
into
such
a
barrack
as
that
at
loodianah
which
fell
in
upon
and
buried
in
its
ruins
the
remnant
of
her
majesty
regiment
of
foot
one
of
the
most
gallant
regiments
in
the
army
list
they
went
into
the
field
during
the
first
sikh
campaign
nine
hundred
strong
nine
hundred
bright
bayonets
glittered
in
the
sun
as
they
marched
away
to
give
the
foe
in
the
words
of
lord
gough
a
taste
of
cold
stale
they
were
at
moodkee
ferozeshah
aliwal
and
sobraon
out
of
that
nine
hundred
only
three
hundred
returned
to
quarters
in
march
eighteen
hundred
and
in
three
months
six
hundred
had
fallen
in
battle
the
campaign
over
they
were
quartered
at
loodianah
and
placed
in
barracks
which
had
been
frequently
reported
rotten
unsound
and
dangerous
but
of
this
report
though
forwarded
by
the
the
military
board
took
no
notice
the
consequence
was
that
in
a
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
ten
years
ago
the
barracks
came
down
beneath
that
mass
of
dust
and
smoke
and
unburnt
bricks
lay
all
the
men
women
and
children
left
to
represent
the
glorious
regiment
of
foot
beneath
that
mass
were
the
heroes
who
had
escaped
the
carnage
of
the
in
which
three
to
one
of
the
regiment
had
died
men
eighteen
women
and
children
were
killed
by
the
fall
of
those
barracks
one
hundred
and
men
women
and
children
were
badly
wounded
many
maimed
and
disfigured
for
life
well
might
the
colonel
of
that
regiment
cry
aloud
my
god
there
is
no
left
the
enemy
did
its
worst
but
it
is
the
company
bahadoor
that
has
given
us
the
finishing
blow
the
english
reader
may
possibly
doubt
the
accuracy
of
these
details
but
there
is
a
huge
grave
at
loodianah
containing
the
bones
of
those
men
women
and
children
of
the
and
scores
of
officers
still
live
to
bear
testimony
to
the
truth
of
my
assertions
in
respect
to
this
horrible
catastrophe
the
engineer
at
loodianah
was
written
to
by
the
secretary
of
the
military
board
and
asked
why
he
had
not
made
a
report
of
the
state
of
the
barracks
which
had
fallen
in
he
replied
that
he
had
written
three
letters
on
the
subject
and
that
his
predecessor
in
office
had
written
seven
and
the
foolish
man
was
stupid
enough
to
ransack
the
records
of
his
office
and
had
the
honour
to
transmit
for
information
of
the
board
copies
of
these
documents
for
this
absurd
effort
of
memory
and
ridiculous
attempt
to
clear
himself
of
blame
he
was
removed
from
his
appointment
and
sent
to
do
duty
with
the
sappers
and
miners
a
sort
of
very
severe
punishment
in
the
east
for
any
engineer
officer
guilty
of
an
indiscretion
churchyards
etc
i
can
not
leave
meerut
without
taking
the
reader
to
the
churchyard
of
that
station
an
indian
churchyard
presents
a
very
different
aspect
to
a
churchyard
in
england
or
elsewhere
the
tombs
for
the
most
part
are
very
much
larger
when
first
erected
or
newly
done
up
they
are
as
white
as
snow
formed
as
they
are
generally
of
chunam
plaster
which
somewhat
resembles
roman
cement
but
after
exposure
to
only
one
rainy
season
and
one
hot
weather
they
become
begrimed
and
almost
black
the
birds
flying
from
structure
to
structure
carry
with
them
the
seeds
of
various
plants
and
herbs
and
these
if
not
speedily
removed
take
root
and
grow
apace
a
stranger
wandering
in
the
churchyard
of
meerut
might
fancy
that
he
is
amidst
ruins
of
stupendous
antiquity
if
he
were
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
fifty
years
have
scarcely
elapsed
since
the
first
christian
corpse
was
deposited
within
those
walls
which
now
encircle
some
five
acres
of
ground
literally
covered
with
tombs
in
every
stage
of
preservation
and
decay
i
was
conducted
in
my
ramble
through
the
meerut
churchyard
by
an
old
and
very
intelligent
pensioner
who
had
originally
been
a
private
in
a
regiment
of
light
dragoons
this
old
man
lived
by
the
churchyard
that
is
to
say
he
derived
a
very
comfortable
income
from
looking
after
and
keeping
in
repair
the
tombs
of
those
whose
friends
are
now
far
away
but
whose
thoughts
nevertheless
still
turn
occasionally
to
that
christian
enclosure
in
the
land
of
heathens
and
idolaters
i
get
sir
for
this
business
said
the
old
man
pointing
with
his
stick
to
a
very
magnificent
edifice
two
pounds
a
year
it
is
not
much
but
it
is
what
i
asked
and
it
pays
me
very
well
sir
and
if
you
should
go
back
to
england
and
ever
come
across
any
of
her
family
i
hope
sir
you
will
tell
them
that
i
do
my
duty
by
the
grave
not
that
i
think
they
have
any
doubt
of
it
for
they
must
know
or
leastways
they
have
been
told
by
them
they
can
believe
that
if
i
never
received
a
farthing
from
them
i
would
always
keep
it
in
repair
as
it
is
now
god
bless
her
and
rest
her
soul
she
was
as
good
and
as
beautiful
a
woman
as
ever
trod
this
earth
who
was
she
the
wife
of
an
officer
in
my
old
regiment
sir
i
was
in
her
troop
he
been
out
twice
since
the
regiment
went
home
only
to
visit
this
grave
for
he
has
long
since
sold
out
of
the
service
and
is
a
rich
gentleman
the
last
time
he
came
was
about
five
years
ago
he
comes
what
you
call
nobody
knows
who
he
is
and
he
never
calls
on
anybody
all
that
he
now
does
in
this
country
is
to
come
here
stop
for
three
days
and
nights
putting
up
at
the
d√¢k
bungalow
and
spending
his
time
here
crying
it
is
there
that
he
stands
where
you
stand
now
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
tablet
and
sometimes
laying
his
head
down
on
the
stone
and
calling
out
her
name
ellen
my
own
dear
ellen
he
did
love
her
sir
judging
from
the
age
of
the
lady
and
the
date
of
her
death
he
must
be
rather
an
old
man
now
yes
sir
he
must
be
more
than
sixty
but
his
love
for
her
memory
is
just
as
strong
as
ever
she
died
of
a
fever
poor
thing
and
for
that
business
he
again
pointed
with
his
stick
to
a
tomb
admirably
preserved
i
used
to
get
two
pounds
ten
shillings
that
is
the
tomb
of
a
little
girl
of
five
years
old
the
daughter
of
a
civilian
the
parents
are
now
dead
they
must
be
for
i
have
not
heard
of
or
received
anything
from
for
more
than
six
years
past
then
who
keeps
the
tomb
in
repair
i
do
sir
when
i
am
here
with
my
trowel
and
mortar
and
whitewash
why
should
i
make
the
outside
of
the
little
lady
last
home
on
earth
as
bright
and
as
fair
as
those
of
her
friends
and
neighbours
i
have
a
nursery
of
as
i
call
it
over
in
yonder
corner
the
children
corner
some
of
are
paid
for
others
not
but
when
there
doing
what
needful
i
touch
up
all
alike
bless
their
dear
little
souls
and
somehow
or
other
every
good
action
meets
its
own
reward
and
often
when
we
least
expect
it
now
for
instance
sir
about
three
years
and
a
half
ago
i
was
over
there
putting
the
nursery
in
good
order
when
up
comes
a
gentleman
and
looks
about
the
graves
suddenly
he
stopped
opposite
to
one
and
began
to
read
and
presently
he
took
out
his
pocket
handkerchief
and
put
it
to
his
eyes
you
know
that
little
child
sir
said
i
when
it
was
not
improper
to
speak
it
said
he
it
was
my
own
little
boy
me
sir
i
answered
him
you
are
then
lieutenant
statterleigh
was
said
he
i
am
now
the
colonel
of
a
regiment
that
has
just
come
to
india
and
is
now
stationed
at
dinapore
but
tell
me
who
keeps
this
grave
in
order
do
sir
says
i
whose
expense
says
he
nobody
sir
says
i
is
kept
in
order
by
the
dictates
of
my
own
conscience
your
little
boy
is
in
good
company
here
and
while
i
am
whitening
the
tombs
of
the
other
little
dears
i
have
it
not
in
my
heart
to
pass
by
his
without
giving
it
a
touch
also
blest
if
he
did
take
me
to
the
house
where
he
was
staying
and
give
me
five
hundred
rupees
that
sort
of
thing
has
happened
to
me
more
than
five
or
six
times
in
my
life
not
that
i
ever
hope
or
think
of
being
paid
for
such
work
and
labour
when
i
am
about
it
that
must
have
been
a
magnificent
affair
said
i
pointing
to
a
heap
of
red
stone
and
marble
but
how
comes
it
in
ruins
it
is
just
as
it
was
left
sir
the
lady
died
her
husband
a
judge
here
took
on
terribly
and
ordered
that
tomb
for
her
some
of
the
stone
was
brought
from
agra
some
from
delhi
but
before
it
was
put
together
and
properly
erected
he
married
again
and
the
work
was
stopped
i
was
present
at
the
funeral
there
was
no
getting
him
away
after
the
service
was
over
and
at
last
they
had
to
resort
to
force
and
violence
in
fact
to
carry
him
out
of
the
yard
but
the
shallowest
waters
as
the
proverb
says
sir
always
make
the
most
noise
while
those
are
the
deepest
that
flow
on
silently
yonder
is
a
funny
tomb
sir
continued
the
old
man
again
pointing
with
his
stick
there
close
to
the
tomb
of
the
lady
which
i
first
showed
you
how
do
you
mean
funny
i
asked
observing
nothing
particular
in
the
structure
well
sir
it
is
funny
only
on
account
of
the
history
of
the
two
gentlemen
whose
remains
it
covers
replied
the
old
man
leading
me
to
the
tomb
one
of
these
young
gentlemen
sir
was
an
officer
a
lieutenant
in
the
bengal
horse
artillery
the
other
was
an
ensign
in
a
royal
regiment
of
the
line
there
was
a
ball
and
by
some
accident
that
beautiful
lady
of
our
regiment
had
engaged
herself
to
both
of
them
for
the
same
dance
when
the
time
came
both
went
up
and
claimed
her
hand
neither
of
them
would
give
way
and
the
lady
not
wishing
to
offend
either
by
showing
a
preference
and
finding
herself
in
a
dilemma
declined
to
dance
with
either
not
satisfied
with
this
they
retired
to
the
verandah
where
they
had
some
high
words
and
the
next
morning
they
met
behind
the
church
there
and
fought
a
duel
in
which
both
of
them
fell
mortally
wounded
they
had
scarcely
time
to
shake
hands
with
one
another
when
they
died
in
those
days
matters
of
the
kind
were
very
easily
hushed
up
and
it
was
given
out
though
everybody
knew
to
the
contrary
that
one
had
died
of
fever
and
the
other
of
cholera
and
they
were
both
buried
side
by
side
in
one
grave
and
this
tomb
was
erected
over
them
at
the
joint
expense
of
the
two
regiments
to
which
they
belonged
i
get
ten
rupees
a
year
for
keeping
this
grave
in
order
who
pays
you
a
gentleman
in
calcutta
a
relation
of
one
of
them
i
tell
you
what
it
is
sir
this
foolish
affair
which
ended
so
fatally
sowed
the
seeds
of
the
fever
that
carried
off
that
beautiful
and
good
woman
yonder
she
was
maddened
by
the
thought
of
being
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
in
which
they
lost
their
lives
i
knew
them
both
sir
from
seeing
them
so
often
on
the
parade
ground
and
at
the
very
fine
young
men
they
were
sir
yes
here
they
sleep
in
peace
whose
tombs
are
those
i
asked
pointing
to
some
two
or
three
hundred
which
were
all
exactly
alike
and
in
three
straight
lines
in
other
words
three
deep
those
are
the
tombs
of
the
men
of
the
cameronians
sir
these
graves
are
all
uniform
as
you
observe
fever
made
sad
havoc
with
that
regiment
they
lost
some
three
companies
in
all
behind
them
are
the
tombs
of
the
men
of
the
buffs
and
behind
them
the
tombs
of
the
men
of
other
royal
regiments
of
infantry
all
uniform
you
see
sir
but
those
of
each
regiment
rather
differently
shaped
to
the
right
flanking
the
infantry
tombs
are
the
tombs
of
the
men
of
the
cavalry
and
dragoons
and
lancers
in
the
rear
of
the
cavalry
are
the
tombs
of
the
horse
and
foot
artillerymen
all
uniform
you
see
sir
egad
if
they
could
rise
just
now
what
a
pretty
little
army
they
would
form
of
all
ranks
some
thousands
of
and
well
officered
too
they
would
be
and
here
a
man
to
lead
them
this
is
the
tomb
of
considine
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
in
the
british
army
he
was
the
officer
that
the
duke
of
wellington
fixed
upon
to
bring
the
foot
into
good
order
when
they
ran
riot
in
gibraltar
some
years
ago
this
is
the
tomb
of
general
considine
rotting
and
going
rapidly
to
decay
though
it
was
only
built
in
the
year
a
great
deal
of
money
is
squandered
in
the
churchyards
in
india
tombs
are
erected
and
at
a
great
expense
frequently
after
they
are
once
put
up
it
is
very
seldom
that
they
are
visited
or
heeded
tens
of
thousands
of
pounds
have
been
thrown
away
on
the
vast
pile
of
bricks
and
mortar
and
stone
that
you
now
see
within
this
enclosure
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
all
are
crumbling
away
a
hindoo
a
sweeper
said
to
me
the
other
day
in
this
graveyard
do
you
english
burn
your
dead
as
we
do
instead
of
leaving
their
graves
here
to
tell
us
how
much
you
can
neglect
them
and
how
little
you
care
for
them
what
is
the
use
of
whitening
a
few
sepulchres
amidst
this
mass
of
black
ruin
i
had
no
answer
to
give
the
fellow
sir
indeed
the
same
thought
had
often
occurred
to
me
while
at
work
in
this
wilderness
do
you
not
think
sir
that
the
government
through
its
own
executive
officers
ought
to
expend
a
few
hundred
pounds
every
year
on
these
yards
in
order
to
avert
such
a
scandal
and
disgrace
i
do
not
speak
interestedly
i
have
as
much
already
on
my
hands
as
i
can
perform
if
not
more
but
i
do
often
think
that
there
is
really
some
reason
in
the
remarks
of
that
sweeper
all
these
graves
that
you
see
here
so
blackened
and
left
to
go
to
ruin
are
the
graves
of
men
who
have
served
their
country
and
died
in
its
service
very
little
money
would
keep
the
yard
free
from
this
grass
and
these
rank
weeds
and
very
little
more
would
make
all
these
tombs
fit
to
be
seen
for
neither
labour
nor
whitewash
is
expensive
in
this
part
of
the
world
one
would
hardly
suppose
on
looking
about
him
just
now
that
the
sons
and
daughters
of
some
of
the
best
families
in
england
are
buried
here
and
that
in
a
very
short
time
no
one
will
be
able
to
distinguish
the
spot
where
each
is
lying
so
defaced
and
so
much
alike
will
all
the
ruins
become
what
sir
i
repeat
is
the
use
of
throwing
away
money
in
building
tombs
if
they
are
not
kept
in
repair
instead
of
laying
out
fifty
or
a
hundred
pounds
on
a
thing
like
this
why
not
lay
out
only
five
pounds
on
a
single
and
put
the
rest
out
at
interest
to
keep
it
up
or
a
small
slab
with
an
iron
railing
round
it
ah
sir
but
then
you
would
require
an
european
to
remain
here
and
a
couple
of
native
watchmen
to
see
that
the
railings
were
not
carried
off
by
the
villagers
as
it
is
they
never
allow
an
iron
railing
to
remain
longer
than
a
week
or
so
long
as
that
they
watch
for
an
opportunity
jump
over
this
low
wall
and
tear
them
down
or
wrench
them
off
and
away
with
them
but
surely
there
is
some
one
to
watch
the
yard
yes
two
sweepers
men
of
the
lowest
caste
of
hindoos
and
when
it
is
found
out
that
a
grave
has
been
plundered
of
its
railings
or
that
the
little
marble
tablet
which
some
have
has
been
taken
away
they
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
matter
and
are
simply
discharged
and
two
others
of
the
same
caste
are
put
into
their
places
it
would
not
be
much
to
build
a
comfortable
little
bungalow
for
an
european
a
man
like
myself
for
instance
and
give
the
yard
into
his
charge
holding
him
responsible
for
any
damage
done
and
requiring
him
to
see
that
the
grave
of
every
christian
man
woman
and
child
is
kept
in
good
order
but
horrible
as
is
the
condition
of
this
churchyard
looking
as
it
does
for
the
most
part
more
like
a
receptacle
for
the
bodies
of
felons
than
those
of
good
and
brave
soldiers
and
civilians
and
their
wives
and
children
it
is
really
nothing
when
compared
with
the
graveyard
of
kernaul
kernaul
you
know
sir
was
our
great
frontier
station
some
twenty
years
ago
it
was
in
fact
as
large
a
station
as
umballah
now
is
it
had
its
church
its
its
barracks
for
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
its
magnificent
bungalows
and
all
the
rest
of
it
for
some
reason
or
other
but
what
that
reason
was
i
could
never
discover
nor
anybody
else
to
my
knowledge
the
station
was
abandoned
with
all
its
buildings
which
cost
the
government
and
private
individuals
lacs
and
lacs
of
rupees
you
may
be
pretty
sure
that
the
villagers
were
not
long
in
plundering
every
house
that
was
unprotected
away
went
the
doors
and
windows
the
venetians
and
every
bar
bolt
nail
or
bit
of
iron
upon
which
they
could
lay
their
fingers
not
content
with
this
the
brutes
set
fire
to
many
or
nearly
all
of
the
thatched
bungalows
in
the
hope
of
picking
up
something
amongst
the
ruins
the
church
the
largest
and
best
in
the
upper
provinces
with
no
one
to
take
care
of
it
was
one
of
the
first
places
that
suffered
like
the
other
buildings
it
was
despoiled
of
its
doors
windows
benches
bolts
nails
and
they
carried
away
every
marble
tablet
therein
erected
and
removeable
without
much
difficulty
and
the
same
kind
of
havoc
was
made
in
the
the
tombs
were
smashed
some
of
the
graves
and
especially
the
vaults
opened
and
plainly
enough
was
it
to
be
seen
that
the
low
caste
men
had
broken
open
the
coffins
and
examined
their
contents
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
ring
or
an
or
some
other
ornament
on
the
person
of
the
dead
i
went
there
a
year
ago
on
some
business
connected
with
the
grave
of
a
lady
whose
husband
wished
her
remains
to
be
removed
to
meerut
and
placed
in
the
same
vault
with
those
of
his
sister
who
died
here
about
eighteen
months
since
i
was
not
successful
however
there
was
no
trace
of
her
tomb
it
was
of
stone
and
had
been
taken
away
bodily
to
pave
the
elephant
shed
or
camel
yard
perhaps
of
some
rich
native
in
the
neighbourhood
looking
around
me
as
i
did
and
remembering
kernaul
when
it
was
crowded
with
europeans
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
british
had
been
turned
out
of
the
country
by
the
natives
and
that
the
most
sacred
spot
in
the
cantonment
had
been
desecrated
out
of
spite
or
revenge
and
it
is
just
what
they
would
do
if
ever
they
got
the
upper
hand
whilst
i
write
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
this
old
soldier
and
his
family
perished
in
the
massacre
at
meerut
on
the
of
may
he
was
in
some
way
related
to
or
connected
by
marriage
with
courtenay
the
keeper
of
the
hotel
who
with
her
nieces
was
so
barbarously
murdered
on
that
disastrous
occasion
why
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
the
old
man
stooping
down
and
picking
up
something
if
the
old
gentleman
has
shed
his
skin
again
this
is
the
skin
of
a
very
large
snake
a
cobra
capella
that
i
have
known
for
the
last
thirteen
years
he
must
be
precious
old
from
his
size
the
slowness
of
his
movements
and
the
bad
cough
he
has
had
for
the
last
four
or
five
years
last
winter
he
was
very
bad
indeed
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
die
he
was
then
living
in
the
ruins
of
old
general
webster
vault
and
coughing
continually
just
like
a
man
with
the
asthma
however
i
strewed
a
lot
of
fine
ashes
and
some
bits
of
wool
in
the
ruin
to
keep
him
warm
by
night
and
some
fine
white
sand
at
the
entrance
upon
which
he
used
to
crawl
out
and
bask
when
the
sun
had
made
it
hot
enough
and
when
the
warm
weather
set
in
he
got
all
right
again
rather
a
strange
fancy
of
yours
to
live
upon
such
amicable
terms
with
the
great
enemy
of
the
human
race
well
perhaps
it
is
but
he
once
bit
and
killed
a
thief
who
came
here
to
rob
a
child
grave
of
the
iron
railings
which
its
parents
contrary
to
my
advice
had
placed
round
it
and
ever
since
then
i
have
liked
the
snake
and
have
never
thought
of
molesting
him
i
have
had
many
an
opportunity
of
killing
him
if
i
had
wished
to
do
it
when
i
have
caught
him
asleep
on
the
tombstones
in
the
winter
sun
i
could
kill
him
this
very
day
this
very
hour
if
i
liked
for
i
know
where
he
is
at
this
very
moment
he
is
in
a
hole
close
to
the
ochterlony
monument
there
in
that
corner
of
the
yard
but
why
should
i
hurt
him
he
has
never
offered
to
do
me
any
harm
and
when
i
sing
as
i
sometimes
do
when
i
am
alone
here
at
work
on
some
tomb
or
other
he
will
crawl
up
and
listen
for
two
or
three
hours
together
one
morning
while
he
was
listening
he
came
in
for
a
good
meal
which
lasted
him
some
days
how
was
this
i
will
tell
you
sir
a
minar
was
chased
by
a
small
hawk
and
in
despair
came
and
perched
itself
on
the
top
of
a
most
lofty
tomb
at
which
i
was
at
work
the
hawk
with
his
eyes
fixed
intently
on
his
prey
did
not
i
fancy
see
the
snake
lying
motionless
in
the
grass
or
if
he
did
see
him
he
did
not
think
he
was
a
snake
but
something
else
my
crowbar
perhaps
after
a
little
while
the
hawk
pounced
down
and
was
just
about
to
give
the
minar
a
blow
and
a
grip
when
the
snake
suddenly
lifted
his
head
raised
his
hood
and
hissed
the
hawk
gave
a
shriek
fluttered
flapped
his
wings
with
all
his
might
and
tried
very
hard
to
fly
away
but
it
would
not
do
strong
as
the
eye
of
the
hawk
was
the
eye
of
the
snake
was
stronger
the
hawk
for
a
time
seemed
suspended
in
the
air
but
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
come
down
and
sit
opposite
to
the
old
gentleman
the
snake
who
commenced
with
his
forked
tongue
and
keeping
his
eyes
upon
him
all
the
while
to
slime
his
victim
all
over
this
occupied
him
for
at
least
forty
minutes
and
by
the
time
the
process
was
over
the
hawk
was
perfectly
motionless
i
do
think
he
was
dead
but
he
was
very
soon
however
for
the
old
gentleman
put
him
into
a
coil
or
two
and
crackled
up
every
bone
in
the
hawk
body
he
then
gave
him
another
sliming
made
a
big
mouth
distended
his
neck
till
it
was
as
big
round
as
the
thickest
part
of
my
arm
and
down
went
the
hawk
like
a
shin
of
beef
into
a
beggarman
bag
and
what
became
of
the
minar
he
was
off
like
a
shot
sir
the
moment
his
enemy
was
in
trouble
and
no
blame
to
him
what
a
funny
thing
nature
is
altogether
sir
i
very
often
think
of
that
scene
when
i
am
at
work
here
but
this
place
must
be
infested
with
snakes
i
have
never
seen
but
that
one
sir
and
i
have
been
here
for
a
long
time
would
you
like
to
see
the
old
gentleman
sir
as
the
sun
is
up
and
the
morning
rather
warm
perhaps
he
will
come
out
if
i
pretend
to
be
at
work
and
give
him
a
ditty
if
he
does
not
we
will
look
in
upon
him
come
along
said
i
accompanied
the
old
man
to
a
tomb
close
to
the
monument
beneath
which
the
snake
was
said
to
have
taken
up
his
abode
i
did
not
go
very
near
to
the
spot
but
stood
upon
a
tomb
with
a
thick
stick
in
my
hand
quite
prepared
to
slay
the
monster
if
he
approached
me
for
from
childhood
i
have
always
had
an
instinctive
horror
of
reptiles
of
every
species
caste
and
character
the
old
man
began
to
hammer
away
with
his
mallet
and
chisel
and
to
sing
a
very
quaint
old
song
which
i
had
never
heard
before
and
have
never
heard
since
it
was
a
dialogue
or
duet
between
the
little
finger
and
the
thumb
and
began
thus
the
thumb
said
dear
rose
mary
green
when
i
am
king
little
finger
you
shall
be
queen
the
little
finger
replied
who
told
you
so
thummy
thummy
who
told
you
so
the
thumb
responded
it
was
my
own
heart
little
finger
who
told
me
so
the
thumb
then
drew
a
very
flattering
picture
of
the
life
they
would
lead
when
united
in
wedlock
and
concluded
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
thus
thumb
and
when
you
are
dead
little
finger
as
it
may
hap
you
shall
be
buried
little
finger
under
the
tap
little
finger
why
thummy
thummy
why
thummy
thummy
why
thummy
thummy
thumb
that
you
may
drink
little
finger
when
you
are
dry
but
this
ditty
did
not
bring
out
the
snake
i
remarked
this
to
the
old
man
who
replied
he
has
made
his
toilet
yet
has
rubbed
his
scales
up
sir
but
he
be
here
presently
you
will
see
keep
your
eye
on
that
hole
sir
i
am
now
going
to
give
him
a
livelier
tune
which
is
a
great
favourite
of
his
and
forthwith
he
struck
up
an
old
song
beginning
was
in
the
merry
month
of
may
when
bees
from
flower
to
flower
did
hum
out
came
the
snake
before
the
song
was
half
over
before
it
was
concluded
he
had
crawled
slowly
and
if
i
dare
use
such
a
word
rather
majestically
to
within
a
few
paces
of
the
spot
where
the
old
man
was
standing
good
morning
to
you
sir
said
the
old
man
to
the
snake
i
am
happy
to
see
you
in
your
new
suit
of
clothes
i
have
picked
up
your
old
suit
and
i
have
got
it
in
my
pocket
and
a
very
nice
pair
of
slippers
my
old
wife
will
make
out
of
it
the
last
pair
that
she
made
of
your
rejected
apparel
were
given
as
a
present
to
colonel
cureton
who
like
myself
very
much
resembled
the
great
general
bl√ºcher
in
personal
appearance
who
will
get
the
pair
of
which
i
have
now
the
makings
heaven
only
knows
perhaps
old
brigadier
white
who
has
also
a
bl√ºcher
cut
about
him
what
song
would
you
like
next
mavourneen
yes
i
know
that
is
a
pet
song
of
yours
and
you
shall
have
it
the
old
man
sung
the
melody
with
a
tenderness
and
feeling
which
quite
charmed
me
as
well
as
the
snake
who
coiled
himself
up
and
remained
perfectly
still
little
reason
as
i
had
to
doubt
the
truth
of
any
of
the
old
man
statements
i
certainly
should
have
been
sceptical
as
to
the
story
of
the
snake
if
i
had
not
witnessed
the
scene
i
have
attempted
to
describe
well
sir
said
the
old
man
coming
up
to
me
after
he
had
made
a
salaam
to
the
snake
and
left
him
it
is
almost
and
i
will
with
your
permission
bid
you
good
morning
i
thanked
him
very
much
for
his
information
and
suffered
him
to
depart
and
then
alone
i
wandered
about
that
piece
of
ground
i
have
always
had
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
strolling
from
tombstone
to
tombstone
and
reading
the
various
epitaphs
and
on
that
morning
after
all
that
i
had
heard
from
the
old
pensioner
i
was
just
in
the
humour
for
gratifying
this
morbid
desire
some
miles
to
the
northward
of
meerut
is
the
station
of
burnampore
no
troops
are
quartered
here
it
is
what
is
called
in
india
a
purely
civil
station
containing
only
a
magistrate
who
is
also
the
collector
of
the
revenue
an
assistant
a
covenanted
civilian
the
establishment
of
the
office
and
a
small
police
force
to
these
two
gentlemen
and
their
few
subordinates
were
entrusted
the
care
and
the
collections
of
a
district
as
large
as
lancashire
or
yorkshire
and
containing
possibly
as
many
inhabitants
the
idea
of
two
gentlemen
keeping
in
order
a
district
of
such
dimensions
was
simply
absurd
but
they
did
their
best
and
that
was
all
that
could
be
expected
of
them
i
remained
four
days
and
nights
at
burnampore
and
during
that
time
was
a
guest
of
the
assistant
magistrate
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
at
meerut
anything
more
monotonous
and
dreary
than
the
existence
of
a
gentleman
stationed
at
such
a
place
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
imagine
my
host
assured
me
that
if
it
were
not
for
an
occasional
visit
paid
by
some
traveller
on
his
way
up
or
down
the
country
both
himself
and
his
superior
officer
would
have
died
of
ennui
if
it
were
not
for
the
shooting
which
is
very
good
in
this
district
he
added
i
would
rather
be
a
permanent
passenger
on
board
ship
or
the
inmate
of
a
debtors
prison
in
london
or
any
other
part
of
england
in
either
case
one
would
have
something
like
company
and
one
would
have
at
all
events
a
somewhat
cooler
and
more
congenial
climate
in
the
district
of
burnampore
there
are
a
great
number
of
wolves
and
during
my
short
stay
even
two
were
brought
in
and
the
government
reward
two
rupees
claimed
upon
them
these
ferocious
creatures
often
carry
off
the
young
children
of
poor
people
and
devour
them
it
was
in
this
district
that
a
wolf
child
as
the
natives
of
india
express
it
was
found
some
years
ago
and
taken
to
meerut
where
it
was
exhibited
as
a
curiosity
there
can
be
no
question
said
my
friend
and
host
when
i
spoke
to
him
one
morning
on
this
subject
that
the
male
wolf
in
all
these
cases
seizes
and
runs
off
with
the
infant
and
that
when
he
has
carried
it
alive
to
the
den
the
female
especially
if
she
happens
to
have
cubs
at
the
time
instead
of
killing
and
devouring
suckles
and
fosters
the
little
human
being
so
after
all
the
story
of
romulus
and
remus
may
not
be
a
mere
fable
no
said
i
but
what
is
that
greek
epigram
from
the
anthology
of
bland
and
merivale
the
that
suckled
the
whelp
of
a
wolf
which
wolf
when
she
had
no
more
milk
to
give
it
killed
her
and
eat
her
something
about
kind
be
gentle
and
do
what
you
will
a
stubborn
nature
will
be
nature
still
yes
replied
my
host
i
do
remember
something
about
it
and
by
and
bye
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
and
refer
to
the
volume
which
i
have
amongst
my
books
but
at
present
you
must
excuse
me
for
i
have
a
duty
to
perform
you
may
come
with
me
and
witness
the
operation
if
you
like
but
understand
me
i
shall
not
be
offended
if
you
decline
to
do
so
what
operation
that
of
hanging
what
hanging
hanging
what
a
man
a
culprit
a
murderer
is
is
a
part
of
my
duty
to
see
this
operation
performed
come
he
added
energetically
and
slapping
me
on
the
shoulder
come
be
a
sort
of
selwyn
for
once
in
your
life
whilst
i
was
hesitating
the
magistrate
approached
in
his
buggy
he
had
been
taking
his
morning
drive
and
had
dropt
in
upon
his
assistant
to
have
some
friendly
conversation
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
forthcoming
execution
and
on
hearing
that
we
were
just
about
to
start
for
the
spot
he
very
kindly
offered
to
take
us
there
an
offer
which
was
accepted
by
his
assistant
with
many
thanks
so
off
we
drove
three
in
a
gig
like
so
many
men
going
to
witness
a
pugilistic
encounter
in
england
during
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
when
we
had
arrived
at
the
place
of
execution
a
field
some
distance
from
the
gaol
in
which
had
been
erected
a
temporary
gallows
i
was
surprised
at
not
finding
a
mob
there
was
no
one
there
but
the
culprit
who
was
eating
as
much
rice
as
he
could
and
as
fast
as
he
could
a
couple
of
native
policemen
with
drawn
swords
guarding
him
the
gaoler
who
was
a
mahommedan
and
a
bengalee
writer
clerk
who
stood
with
pen
ink
and
paper
in
hand
ready
to
dot
down
the
official
particulars
of
the
scene
preparatory
to
their
being
forwarded
to
government
according
to
a
certain
regulation
is
everything
ready
said
the
assistant
magistrate
to
the
gaoler
yes
sahib
he
replied
but
he
has
not
yet
finished
his
breakfast
in
one
minute
sahib
cried
the
culprit
who
overheard
the
conversation
and
hastily
taking
into
his
stomach
the
few
grains
of
rice
that
remained
upon
the
dish
and
drinking
the
remainder
of
his
of
milk
he
sprang
up
and
called
out
the
word
tyear
signifying
i
am
ready
he
was
then
led
up
to
the
scaffold
the
most
primitive
affair
that
i
ever
beheld
it
was
only
a
piece
of
woodwork
resembling
a
large
crock
or
crate
in
which
a
is
packed
for
exportation
upon
this
crock
which
was
placed
under
the
beam
he
was
requested
to
stand
having
obeyed
this
order
the
rope
was
adjusted
around
his
neck
the
assistant
magistrate
then
called
out
to
him
in
hindostanee
have
you
anything
to
say
yes
sahib
was
the
reply
and
he
began
a
long
story
false
from
beginning
to
end
but
every
word
of
which
the
bengalee
writer
took
down
he
spoke
and
with
vehemence
for
about
minutes
when
having
stopped
either
finally
or
to
take
breath
the
assistant
magistrate
gave
the
signal
to
the
gaoler
by
waving
his
hand
the
crock
was
then
pulled
from
under
the
culprit
by
the
two
policemen
and
down
dangled
the
culprit
body
the
feet
not
more
than
eighteen
inches
from
the
ground
they
are
not
adepts
in
the
art
of
hanging
in
india
it
took
the
culprit
at
least
ten
minutes
to
die
at
times
i
feared
so
desperate
were
his
struggles
that
he
would
break
the
beam
snap
the
rope
or
bring
down
the
whole
apparatus
in
the
days
of
henry
fielding
the
vulgar
used
to
speak
of
hanging
as
dancing
on
nothing
and
this
horrible
idea
the
indian
culprit
on
that
morning
amply
realised
the
reader
must
not
however
sympathize
with
his
sufferings
he
had
been
justly
convicted
and
was
justly
put
to
death
for
murdering
in
that
very
field
where
he
expiated
his
offence
a
little
girl
of
seven
years
of
age
in
order
to
possess
himself
of
a
single
bangle
she
wore
a
bangle
valued
at
one
rupee
four
annas
of
english
money
i
can
not
accuse
myself
of
a
cruel
or
brutal
disposition
but
if
the
monster
whom
i
saw
hanged
had
had
a
thousand
lives
instead
of
one
i
could
have
witnessed
the
taking
of
every
one
of
them
without
a
single
atom
of
a
desire
to
save
him
the
cutting
down
of
the
culprit
as
soon
as
it
was
discovered
that
life
was
extinct
for
as
there
was
no
crowd
of
pickpockets
and
vendors
of
cakes
and
to
take
a
moral
lesson
the
prescribed
hour
was
unnecessary
was
quite
as
primitive
as
the
foregoing
part
of
the
operation
one
of
the
native
policemen
with
his
blunt
sword
severed
the
rope
by
sawing
it
just
above
the
tie
and
down
came
the
corpse
i
was
tempted
to
jump
out
of
the
buggy
in
which
sitting
between
the
magistrate
and
his
assistant
i
had
witnessed
the
execution
and
examine
or
rather
look
attentively
at
the
deceased
a
finer
head
in
a
phrenological
point
of
view
i
had
never
seen
and
across
the
naked
chest
was
suspended
the
sacred
thread
indicating
that
the
culprit
was
a
brahmin
is
it
not
very
odd
said
i
on
my
return
to
the
buggy
that
most
of
the
diabolical
crimes
committed
in
this
country
are
committed
by
brahmins
not
at
all
odd
replied
my
host
do
you
not
know
that
they
believe
nothing
can
hurt
their
pure
souls
after
death
and
hence
their
comparative
recklessness
in
this
world
there
was
a
brahmin
hanged
here
about
a
year
ago
who
just
before
he
was
turned
off
made
a
speech
such
as
that
made
by
napoleon
on
paper
to
sir
hudson
lowe
may
convict
me
of
what
you
please
you
may
make
me
a
prisoner
you
may
if
you
like
shackle
these
limbs
and
consign
me
to
a
dungeon
but
you
will
find
that
my
soul
will
be
just
as
free
just
as
proud
as
when
it
awed
all
europe
ah
but
that
was
the
emanation
of
what
the
deuce
is
that
cried
the
magistrate
who
was
driving
us
rapidly
towards
home
see
that
thing
in
the
road
and
coming
up
to
it
he
reined
in
the
horse
the
syce
groom
who
was
running
behind
the
buggy
picked
up
the
object
at
his
master
bidding
it
was
a
cloak
a
lady
cloak
made
of
most
costly
materials
satin
and
silk
and
wadded
throughout
it
had
evidently
fallen
unobserved
from
some
palanquin
during
the
night
and
an
examination
of
the
footprints
showed
that
the
last
traveller
who
had
moved
along
the
road
was
journeying
upward
and
was
then
most
probably
staying
at
the
d√¢k
bungalow
at
deobund
a
some
twelve
miles
distant
the
assistant
magistrate
after
we
had
breakfasted
proposed
that
he
and
i
should
drive
to
deobund
and
make
inquiries
i
was
nothing
loth
and
a
swift
mare
having
been
harnessed
and
put
to
the
buggy
off
we
started
two
sowars
native
horsemen
or
mounted
police
cantering
behind
us
about
two
miles
from
the
bungalow
to
which
we
were
proceeding
we
overtook
a
tribe
of
large
monkeys
i
should
say
there
were
as
many
as
four
hundred
and
each
carried
a
stick
of
uniform
length
and
shape
they
moved
along
in
ranks
or
companies
just
in
short
as
though
they
were
imitating
a
wing
of
a
regiment
of
infantry
at
the
head
of
this
tribe
was
an
old
and
very
powerful
monkey
who
was
no
doubt
the
chief
it
was
a
very
odd
sight
and
i
became
greatly
interested
in
the
movements
of
the
creatures
there
could
be
no
question
that
they
had
either
some
business
or
some
pleasure
on
hand
and
the
fact
of
each
carrying
a
stick
led
us
to
conclude
that
it
was
the
former
upon
which
they
were
bent
their
destination
was
like
ours
evidently
deobund
where
there
are
some
hundreds
of
monkeys
fed
by
a
number
of
brahmins
who
live
near
a
hindoo
temple
there
and
perform
religious
ceremonies
they
this
monkey
regiment
would
not
get
out
of
the
road
on
our
account
nor
disturb
themselves
in
any
way
and
my
friend
was
afraid
to
drive
through
their
ranks
or
over
any
of
them
for
when
assailed
they
are
most
ferocious
brutes
and
armed
as
they
were
and
in
such
numbers
they
could
have
annihilated
us
with
the
greatest
ease
there
was
no
help
for
us
therefore
but
to
let
the
mare
proceed
at
a
walk
in
the
rear
of
the
tribe
the
members
of
which
now
that
we
were
nearing
deobund
began
to
chatter
frightfully
just
before
we
came
to
the
bungalow
they
left
the
road
and
took
the
direction
of
the
temple
fain
would
we
have
followed
them
but
to
do
so
in
the
buggy
would
have
been
impossible
for
they
crossed
over
some
very
rough
ground
and
two
ditches
my
friend
therefore
requested
the
sowars
to
follow
them
and
report
all
they
might
observe
of
their
actions
meanwhile
we
moved
off
to
the
bungalow
in
search
of
the
owner
of
the
cloak
the
first
person
whom
we
saw
was
an
ayah
who
was
sitting
in
the
verandah
playing
with
a
child
of
about
five
years
of
age
whose
child
is
that
asked
the
of
the
ayah
the
what
is
the
mem
name
i
do
know
she
replied
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say
that
she
was
not
warranted
in
being
communicative
while
travelling
few
servants
who
know
their
business
will
tell
strangers
the
name
of
their
master
or
mistress
what
is
name
he
then
inquired
of
the
boy
in
english
i
do
understand
you
was
the
reply
in
hindostanee
accompanied
by
a
shake
of
the
head
it
is
wonderful
how
rapidly
the
children
of
europeans
in
india
take
a
cue
from
a
native
servant
of
either
sex
not
always
but
in
very
many
cases
it
is
in
deceit
and
falsehood
that
children
are
first
schooled
by
the
servants
the
reader
must
understand
that
deceit
and
falsehood
are
not
regarded
as
immoralities
in
the
eyes
of
asiatics
a
man
or
woman
who
by
fraud
and
perjury
wins
a
cause
or
gains
any
other
point
is
not
looked
down
upon
as
a
rogue
but
up
to
as
a
very
clever
fellow
several
other
experiments
were
made
in
order
to
extract
from
the
ayah
the
name
of
her
mistress
but
to
no
purpose
the
only
information
we
could
learn
was
that
the
lady
was
much
fatigued
and
was
sleeping
we
said
nothing
about
the
cloak
by
the
way
the
servants
of
the
bungalow
and
at
deobund
there
were
four
of
them
now
came
up
to
make
their
most
respectful
salaam
to
one
of
the
lords
of
the
district
the
on
questioning
them
in
private
as
to
the
name
of
the
lady
we
were
in
no
way
successful
all
that
the
ayah
would
tell
them
they
said
was
that
she
had
come
from
calcutta
and
was
going
to
simlah
she
is
a
burra
beebee
however
sahib
added
the
khansamah
for
all
along
the
road
after
she
left
the
steamer
at
allahabad
until
she
arrived
at
meerut
she
was
escorted
by
two
sowars
and
when
she
reaches
the
saharunpore
bungalow
she
will
find
sowars
ready
this
is
the
only
district
in
which
she
has
had
no
escort
this
was
a
mystery
that
my
friend
could
not
unravel
why
if
other
magistrates
had
been
indented
upon
as
magistrates
very
frequently
were
when
ladies
were
nervous
and
travelling
with
only
an
ayah
he
should
be
omitted
especially
as
his
district
was
as
dangerous
to
pass
through
as
any
other
not
that
there
was
much
or
any
danger
in
those
days
was
more
than
he
could
understand
and
he
very
naturally
became
all
the
more
curious
apart
from
the
ownership
of
the
cloak
to
know
the
name
of
the
lady
who
had
broken
the
link
of
her
escort
when
she
came
into
his
district
perhaps
said
he
to
me
either
i
have
or
my
chief
has
given
her
husband
some
offence
and
possibly
he
is
enough
to
decline
asking
me
to
do
what
after
all
is
only
a
matter
of
duty
or
of
civility
and
compliment
which
amounts
to
pretty
much
the
same
thing
however
we
shall
see
my
friend
now
mentioned
to
the
khansamah
a
very
old
but
very
active
and
intelligent
man
the
sight
we
had
seen
on
the
road
the
regiment
of
monkeys
ah
exclaimed
the
old
man
it
is
about
the
time
what
time
well
sahib
about
every
five
years
that
tribe
comes
up
the
country
to
pay
a
visit
to
this
place
and
another
tribe
comes
about
the
same
time
from
the
the
hills
they
meet
in
a
jungle
behind
the
old
hindoo
temple
and
there
embrace
each
other
as
though
they
were
human
beings
and
old
friends
who
had
been
parted
for
a
length
of
time
i
have
seen
in
that
jungle
as
many
as
four
or
five
thousand
the
brahmins
say
that
one
large
tribe
comes
all
the
way
from
ajmere
and
another
from
the
southern
side
of
the
country
and
from
nepal
and
tirhoot
there
were
hundreds
of
monkeys
here
this
morning
but
now
i
do
not
see
one
i
suppose
they
have
gone
to
welcome
their
friends
the
sowars
who
had
been
deputed
to
follow
the
tribe
now
rode
up
and
reported
that
in
the
vicinity
of
the
old
temple
there
was
an
army
of
apes
an
army
of
forty
thousand
one
of
the
sowars
in
the
true
spirit
of
oriental
exaggeration
expressed
himself
to
the
effect
that
it
would
be
easier
to
count
the
hairs
of
one
head
than
the
number
there
assembled
let
us
go
and
look
at
them
i
suggested
and
by
the
time
we
return
the
lady
may
be
stirring
but
we
will
not
go
on
foot
said
my
friend
we
will
ride
the
horses
in
the
first
place
i
have
an
instinctive
horror
of
apes
and
should
like
to
have
the
means
of
getting
away
from
them
speedily
if
they
became
too
familiar
or
offensive
in
the
second
place
i
do
not
wish
to
fatigue
myself
by
taking
so
long
a
walk
in
the
heat
of
the
day
we
mounted
the
horses
and
were
soon
at
the
spot
indicated
by
the
sowars
there
were
not
so
many
as
had
been
represented
but
i
am
speaking
very
far
within
bounds
when
i
state
that
there
could
not
have
been
fewer
than
eight
thousand
and
some
of
them
of
an
enormous
size
i
could
scarcely
have
believed
that
there
were
so
many
monkeys
in
the
world
if
i
had
not
visited
benares
and
heard
of
the
tribes
at
gibraltar
their
sticks
which
were
thrown
together
in
a
heap
formed
a
very
large
stack
of
wood
what
is
this
my
friend
said
to
one
of
the
brahmins
for
since
his
appointment
he
had
never
heard
of
this
gathering
of
apes
it
is
a
festival
of
theirs
sahib
was
the
reply
just
as
hindoos
at
stated
times
go
to
hurdwar
hajipore
and
other
places
so
do
these
monkeys
come
to
this
holy
place
and
how
long
do
they
stay
two
or
three
days
then
they
go
away
to
their
homes
in
different
parts
of
the
country
then
attend
to
their
business
for
four
or
five
years
then
come
again
and
do
festival
and
so
on
sir
to
the
end
of
all
time
you
see
that
very
tall
monkey
there
with
two
smaller
ones
on
either
side
of
him
yes
well
sir
that
is
a
very
old
monkey
his
age
is
more
than
twenty
years
i
think
i
first
saw
him
fifteen
years
ago
he
was
then
his
native
place
is
meerut
he
lives
with
the
brahmins
at
the
soorj
khan
near
meerut
the
smaller
ones
are
his
sons
sir
they
have
never
been
here
before
and
you
see
he
is
showing
them
all
about
the
place
like
a
very
good
father
having
seen
enough
of
these
sacred
animals
we
returned
to
the
bungalow
we
were
only
just
in
time
for
the
lady
was
about
to
depart
albeit
the
sun
was
very
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
day
for
the
time
of
year
was
extremely
hot
we
caught
sight
of
her
in
the
verandah
my
friend
became
deadly
pale
and
exclaimed
is
it
possible
what
i
asked
him
i
will
tell
you
on
our
way
home
i
must
see
her
speak
to
her
painful
as
our
meeting
must
be
only
fancy
if
that
cloak
should
be
hers
the
lady
who
must
have
learnt
from
the
servants
at
the
bungalow
the
name
of
my
friend
the
official
evidently
desired
to
avoid
an
interview
with
him
for
upon
our
approach
she
retired
from
the
palanquin
which
she
was
arranging
and
entered
hastily
the
room
she
had
occupied
we
my
friend
and
myself
went
into
the
other
room
of
the
bungalow
which
happened
to
be
vacant
presently
we
heard
the
voice
of
the
ayah
she
was
very
angry
and
was
accusing
the
servants
of
the
bungalow
of
being
thieves
she
had
now
for
the
first
time
since
they
were
lost
missed
several
articles
and
amongst
them
the
cloak
of
her
mistress
she
was
perfectly
ready
to
swear
that
she
had
seen
them
all
since
their
arrival
at
the
bungalow
that
she
had
removed
them
from
the
palkees
with
her
own
hands
and
if
the
servants
had
not
stolen
them
who
had
who
could
have
done
so
distinctly
did
we
hear
the
lady
command
the
ayah
to
be
silent
to
say
nothing
of
the
loss
and
enter
her
palanquin
but
the
ayah
too
much
enraged
to
hear
or
to
heed
the
command
repeated
her
accusation
whereupon
the
servants
in
a
body
rushed
into
the
apartment
in
which
we
were
standing
listening
and
after
protesting
their
perfect
innocence
of
the
theft
referred
to
the
character
for
honesty
which
every
one
of
them
had
borne
for
many
years
strange
to
say
frequent
as
are
the
opportunities
which
the
servants
at
these
bungalows
have
of
pilfering
from
travellers
they
rarely
or
never
avail
themselves
of
such
opportunities
and
whenever
it
has
happened
that
a
lady
or
gentleman
has
died
in
one
of
them
the
money
and
effects
have
always
been
forthcoming
with
nothing
whatever
missing
the
lady
now
forced
the
ayah
to
depart
and
enter
her
palanquin
in
which
the
little
boy
was
sitting
she
was
about
to
follow
when
my
friend
rushed
into
the
verandah
and
seizing
her
by
the
hand
detained
her
she
was
as
agitated
as
he
was
and
quite
as
pale
he
held
her
hand
in
his
with
a
firm
but
withal
a
gentle
grasp
and
looked
into
her
face
which
must
have
been
beautiful
when
she
was
a
few
years
younger
as
it
was
she
had
still
a
charming
profile
and
countenance
and
a
skin
as
white
as
snow
from
the
window
or
rather
looking
through
the
venetians
i
beheld
the
scene
which
reminded
me
of
that
exquisite
picture
of
frank
stone
last
there
was
a
look
of
agony
and
despair
in
the
face
of
the
man
while
the
woman
who
appeared
to
sympathise
with
his
sufferings
did
not
for
awhile
raise
her
eyes
from
the
ground
but
at
length
she
did
so
and
looking
mournfully
into
my
friend
face
for
a
few
seconds
burst
into
tears
and
presently
her
head
involuntarily
as
it
were
rested
on
his
shoulder
suddenly
recollecting
herself
she
again
attempted
to
take
her
departure
but
my
friend
now
grown
desperate
seemingly
placed
her
arm
beneath
his
and
walked
with
her
to
a
clump
of
mango
trees
in
front
of
the
bungalow
and
there
they
held
a
conversation
which
lasted
some
ten
minutes
the
lady
then
tore
herself
away
from
my
friend
and
after
bidding
him
farewell
she
threw
herself
into
her
palanquin
which
was
speedily
lifted
by
the
bearers
and
borne
away
followed
by
the
two
sowars
who
were
commanded
to
escort
the
fair
traveller
to
the
next
station
my
friend
from
the
verandah
of
the
bungalow
watched
the
procession
till
it
was
out
of
sight
and
then
seating
himself
on
the
steps
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
wept
like
a
child
come
i
said
after
a
time
laying
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
am
not
very
impatient
to
know
your
secret
but
it
is
time
that
we
thought
of
returning
what
about
the
cloak
you
have
not
restored
it
to
the
owner
no
my
dear
fellow
and
i
never
intend
to
do
so
she
has
consented
to
my
retaining
it
that
cloak
has
warmed
her
dear
limbs
and
the
sight
of
it
shall
warm
my
heart
till
the
last
hour
of
my
existence
on
the
way
home
my
friend
who
was
accidentally
drowned
in
the
river
jumna
about
two
years
ago
spoke
as
follows
ten
years
have
now
elapsed
since
that
lady
and
i
were
on
board
of
a
ship
bound
from
london
to
calcutta
she
was
then
seventeen
years
of
age
and
i
twenty
on
the
voyage
we
became
very
much
attached
to
each
other
and
eventually
loved
each
other
devotedly
and
what
was
more
we
were
betrothed
it
was
arranged
that
as
soon
as
practicable
we
should
be
married
i
was
compelled
on
arrival
to
remain
at
the
college
at
fort
william
for
a
year
to
pass
an
examination
she
was
obliged
to
proceed
to
a
large
station
in
bengal
to
join
her
family
her
father
was
a
member
of
the
civil
service
previous
to
her
arrival
he
had
promised
alice
that
is
her
name
to
an
old
man
a
judge
who
had
been
twice
married
and
who
was
then
a
widower
this
old
man
was
very
rich
and
had
as
he
still
has
a
great
influence
with
the
government
a
brother
of
his
was
one
of
the
lords
of
and
of
this
country
for
some
time
after
our
unhappy
separation
we
corresponded
regularly
but
suddenly
the
correspondence
ceased
her
letters
to
me
and
mine
to
her
were
intercepted
meanwhile
the
old
judge
to
whom
she
had
been
promised
paid
his
addresses
to
her
she
refused
him
many
devices
were
resorted
to
in
order
to
wean
her
affections
from
me
they
all
failed
at
length
they
hit
upon
one
which
had
the
desired
effect
they
caused
a
paragraph
to
be
inserted
in
one
of
the
calcutta
journals
to
the
effect
that
i
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
merchant
alice
was
permitted
to
see
this
paper
but
none
of
those
containing
my
indignant
denial
of
the
truth
of
the
announcement
in
disgust
at
my
imagined
faithlessness
and
in
despair
and
recklessness
alice
at
length
accepted
the
hand
of
the
old
judge
they
were
married
when
made
acquainted
with
this
horrible
fact
i
became
i
drank
very
hard
had
an
attack
of
and
was
sent
home
for
change
of
air
and
scene
to
recruit
my
health
on
my
return
to
india
after
an
absence
of
eighteen
months
i
was
sent
to
dacca
where
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
my
ever
seeing
alice
subsequently
i
was
at
my
own
request
transferred
to
these
provinces
but
sent
to
banda
a
sort
of
penal
settlement
for
refractory
civilians
not
that
i
ever
committed
any
offence
beyond
that
of
loving
alice
and
being
beloved
by
her
you
must
understand
that
owing
to
the
influence
of
his
brother
her
old
husband
shortly
after
his
marriage
with
alice
became
the
great
man
he
now
is
and
he
had
only
to
express
a
wish
in
this
country
touching
the
appointment
or
of
any
junior
in
the
service
to
have
such
wish
instantly
realised
my
only
surprise
is
that
when
it
became
necessary
for
her
to
pass
through
this
district
i
was
not
ordered
away
to
scinde
on
some
trumpery
business
alleged
to
be
special
had
there
been
any
idea
that
we
should
meet
as
by
the
merest
chance
we
have
met
again
in
this
world
i
should
certainly
have
been
removed
and
ordered
to
some
other
station
miles
away
i
have
never
seen
her
since
we
parted
in
calcutta
now
more
than
nine
years
ago
until
this
very
day
but
thank
heaven
she
loves
me
still
i
was
afraid
when
i
saw
you
talking
to
her
beneath
that
clump
of
trees
that
i
was
about
to
make
some
observations
ah
no
he
interrupted
me
there
is
no
danger
great
and
lasting
as
my
love
for
her
is
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
taking
the
slightest
advantage
of
her
feelings
or
to
see
her
fall
from
the
sphere
in
which
she
holds
a
lofty
and
proud
position
she
is
not
happy
neither
am
i
but
spirits
will
recognise
each
other
and
be
united
for
ever
and
ever
ours
is
not
a
solitary
case
sometimes
when
ladies
in
india
fall
they
deserve
far
more
of
pity
than
of
blame
the
himalayas
i
have
already
spoken
of
a
german
baron
and
a
french
gentleman
whom
i
met
at
agra
and
i
have
said
that
they
like
myself
were
travelling
in
search
of
the
picturesque
and
with
a
view
to
become
acquainted
with
oriental
character
from
personal
observation
while
staying
with
my
friend
at
barnapore
i
received
a
letter
from
the
former
proposing
that
we
should
meet
on
a
certain
day
at
mussoorie
in
the
himalaya
mountains
and
travel
into
the
interior
together
i
agreed
with
all
my
heart
and
my
friend
the
assistant
magistrate
was
tempted
to
apply
for
six
weeks
leave
in
order
that
he
might
accompany
us
let
me
describe
these
foreign
gentlemen
they
were
respectively
about
my
own
age
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
and
of
the
society
at
every
court
and
capital
in
europe
they
were
both
possessed
of
considerable
abilities
and
of
the
most
enviable
dispositions
always
and
patient
and
cheerful
under
those
innumerable
little
difficulties
that
almost
invariably
beset
a
wanderer
in
the
east
or
in
fact
a
wanderer
in
any
part
of
the
world
they
had
moreover
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
each
in
his
own
peculiar
way
could
relate
a
story
or
an
incident
in
his
life
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
it
wonderfully
they
were
men
of
refined
understanding
and
of
very
refined
manners
take
them
all
in
all
they
were
the
most
charming
companions
i
ever
encountered
they
were
utterly
devoid
of
vulgar
nationalities
of
any
enthusiastic
admiration
of
their
own
fatherlands
and
would
just
as
soon
ridicule
the
foibles
peculiar
to
their
own
countries
respectively
as
the
foibles
of
a
man
of
any
other
country
my
friend
the
assistant
magistrate
was
also
a
desirable
companion
he
too
was
a
being
with
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
some
wit
he
had
read
a
great
deal
of
late
years
in
that
station
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
and
he
had
profited
by
his
reading
it
was
beginning
to
be
very
hot
in
the
plains
and
my
friend
and
myself
were
not
a
little
glad
when
we
found
ourselves
on
the
road
to
a
colder
clime
we
drove
as
far
as
deobund
in
the
buggy
and
at
three
threw
ourselves
into
our
palanquins
palkees
bound
for
dehra
dhoon
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
at
which
place
we
arrived
at
about
nine
on
the
following
morning
and
were
deposited
both
of
us
fast
asleep
in
the
verandah
of
the
hotel
kept
by
a
william
johns
who
had
been
formerly
a
professional
jockey
in
the
provinces
of
india
so
much
has
been
written
of
dehra
dhoon
and
mussoorie
that
even
a
brief
sketch
of
these
places
would
be
unwarranted
in
this
narrative
as
soon
as
we
arrived
at
mussoorie
we
began
to
collect
coolies
to
carry
our
baggage
and
stores
we
required
in
all
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
for
the
expedition
and
by
the
time
that
we
had
got
these
people
together
and
made
arrangements
with
them
and
the
guides
whom
we
required
and
had
laid
in
our
stock
of
provisions
the
foreign
gentlemen
joined
us
and
expressed
their
readiness
to
start
at
any
given
moment
we
lingered
however
for
two
days
in
order
that
they
might
take
some
rest
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
gentlemen
at
the
club
who
at
the
instance
of
my
friend
had
made
them
as
well
as
myself
honorary
members
of
the
institution
on
the
third
morning
in
the
front
of
the
our
marching
establishment
was
collected
and
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
of
whom
it
was
composed
were
laden
with
the
baggage
and
stores
there
were
tents
the
poles
thereto
belonging
camp
tables
chairs
beds
bedding
leather
boxes
of
every
kind
containing
our
clothing
deal
chests
containing
all
sorts
of
provisions
dozens
of
cases
of
wine
port
sherry
claret
beer
ducks
fowls
geese
guns
rifles
and
others
umbrellas
having
seen
this
train
fairly
off
we
the
four
of
us
followed
shortly
after
on
foot
and
overtook
them
at
the
landour
hill
a
mountain
about
nine
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
we
were
all
in
high
spirits
including
my
friend
the
assistant
magistrate
notwithstanding
he
put
on
his
lady
love
cloak
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
sight
of
the
club
and
began
to
quote
in
a
melancholy
but
very
loud
voice
which
reverberated
through
the
valleys
on
either
side
of
us
those
glorious
lines
of
the
poet
thomson
there
is
a
power
unseen
that
rules
th
illimitable
world
that
guides
its
motions
from
the
brightest
star
to
least
dust
of
this
mould
while
man
who
madly
deems
himself
the
lord
of
all
is
nought
but
weakness
and
dependence
this
sacred
truth
by
sure
experience
taught
thou
must
have
learnt
when
wandering
all
alone
each
bird
each
insect
flitting
through
the
sky
was
more
sufficient
for
itself
than
our
first
was
about
nine
miles
from
mussoorie
it
was
a
flat
piece
of
ground
some
distance
down
the
southern
face
of
the
peak
over
which
the
road
wound
the
place
was
called
sowcowlee
and
here
and
there
were
to
be
seen
a
few
patches
of
cultivation
and
a
cowshed
our
course
lay
in
the
direction
of
almorah
another
hill
sanatarium
for
the
english
in
india
the
tents
pitched
and
all
made
snug
and
comfortable
we
threw
ourselves
down
upon
our
beds
not
to
sleep
but
to
take
some
rest
after
a
long
walk
meanwhile
our
servants
busied
themselves
in
preparing
the
dinner
for
which
the
exercise
and
the
change
of
air
had
given
us
all
a
keen
appetite
well
exclaimed
my
friend
whom
in
future
we
will
call
west
raising
to
his
lips
a
bumper
of
claret
and
quoting
from
the
sentimental
journey
the
bourbon
is
not
such
a
bad
fellow
after
all
neither
the
frenchman
nor
the
german
understood
the
allusion
but
when
it
was
explained
they
relished
it
amazingly
we
were
rather
a
temperate
party
and
after
the
second
bottle
of
wine
was
emptied
we
caused
the
glasses
to
be
removed
from
our
small
table
and
a
green
cloth
spread
over
it
we
then
began
to
play
at
whist
a
game
of
which
we
were
all
equally
fond
and
what
was
of
great
consequence
we
were
all
equal
as
players
we
did
not
gamble
exactly
but
the
stakes
were
sufficiently
high
to
make
either
side
attend
very
carefully
to
the
game
the
whist
over
we
each
took
a
tumbler
of
warm
drink
and
turned
in
for
the
night
and
slept
as
the
reader
may
imagine
very
soundly
on
the
following
morning
at
sunrise
we
were
awakened
and
informed
that
upon
a
hill
opposite
to
our
encampment
there
were
several
large
deer
we
arose
and
went
in
pursuit
of
them
after
dodging
them
for
some
time
we
came
within
range
and
each
of
us
selecting
his
animal
fired
one
shot
only
took
effect
and
that
was
from
the
baron
rifle
during
our
ramble
we
discovered
that
there
were
plenty
of
pheasants
in
the
locality
and
so
we
agreed
to
remain
for
the
day
and
after
breakfast
see
what
we
could
do
amongst
them
under
the
circumstances
we
should
have
been
compelled
to
halt
for
as
is
usual
on
such
occasions
our
servants
had
forgotten
several
little
matters
essential
for
our
comfort
if
not
necessary
for
our
journey
namely
the
pickles
and
the
sauces
the
corkscrew
the
instrument
for
opening
the
hermetically
sealed
tins
containing
lobsters
oysters
and
preserved
soups
amongst
other
things
that
had
been
left
behind
was
the
guitar
and
without
it
he
could
not
or
would
not
sing
any
of
his
thousand
and
one
famous
german
songs
and
such
a
sweet
voice
as
he
had
so
while
we
were
amongst
the
pheasants
five
coolies
were
on
their
way
back
to
mussoorie
to
bring
up
the
missing
articles
above
enumerated
by
two
we
had
bagged
eleven
noble
birds
and
returned
to
our
encampment
sufficiently
hungry
to
enjoy
the
refreshments
which
the
khansamah
butler
who
was
a
great
artist
in
his
way
had
prepared
for
us
our
repast
concluded
we
had
our
camp
bedsteads
brought
into
the
open
air
and
threw
ourselves
down
on
them
holding
his
cigar
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
the
baron
thus
went
off
who
can
explain
the
inscrutable
mystery
of
presentiments
who
can
fathom
the
secret
inclinations
of
the
human
heart
who
can
lift
the
veil
of
sympathy
who
can
unravel
the
web
of
magnetic
natures
who
can
fully
comprehend
that
link
which
unites
the
corporeal
with
the
spiritual
world
who
can
explain
that
terrible
symbol
which
pervades
so
many
of
our
dreams
the
sweet
anxiety
that
seizes
us
when
listening
to
some
wonderful
tale
the
voluptuous
shiver
which
agitates
our
frame
the
indefinite
yearning
which
fills
the
heart
and
the
soul
all
this
is
a
guarantee
that
some
invisible
chain
links
our
world
with
another
let
no
one
condemn
as
idle
nonsense
that
which
our
shallow
reason
may
refuse
to
accept
can
the
most
acute
understanding
explain
or
even
comprehend
its
own
growth
or
even
the
growth
and
colouring
of
a
mere
flower
is
not
nature
herself
a
perfect
mystery
unto
the
minds
of
thinking
men
what
is
the
matter
baron
asked
the
frenchman
have
you
a
nightmare
in
this
broad
daylight
no
no
returned
the
baron
with
impetuosity
it
is
not
so
i
wish
to
tell
you
something
a
little
story
if
you
will
listen
pray
go
on
we
his
three
companions
cried
out
simultaneously
some
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
the
baron
proceeded
i
was
travelling
from
munich
to
berlin
tired
by
the
continual
rumbling
of
my
carriage
i
resolved
upon
taking
a
day
rest
at
augsburg
it
was
the
day
of
all
souls
the
autumnal
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
a
large
procession
went
its
way
towards
the
cemetery
a
mile
distant
from
the
town
wherefore
i
know
not
but
i
was
instinctively
led
to
join
this
procession
on
arriving
at
the
cemetery
we
found
it
comparatively
crowded
all
the
graves
were
decked
with
flowers
and
sprigs
of
young
cypress
and
near
every
stone
there
sat
or
knelt
at
least
one
mourner
tears
of
love
and
regret
wetted
the
sacred
earth
in
a
singularly
agitated
frame
of
mind
i
wandered
through
the
cemetery
the
recollection
of
departed
friends
and
of
dear
ones
far
away
made
me
sad
unhappy
miserable
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
i
had
been
then
entombed
no
friendly
hand
would
on
that
day
have
deposited
a
wreath
or
a
flower
upon
my
grave
no
beloved
eye
shed
a
tear
of
sorrow
no
faithful
heart
sent
up
to
heaven
a
fervent
prayer
for
the
eternal
rest
of
my
soul
haunted
by
such
gloomy
thoughts
i
wandered
on
and
at
last
came
to
a
grave
an
hour
previously
had
been
buried
in
that
spot
a
young
girl
of
seventeen
years
of
age
the
parents
and
the
lover
of
the
girl
stood
weeping
near
her
grave
and
her
young
friends
adorned
the
mound
with
freshly
gathered
flowers
in
a
fit
of
profound
melancholy
i
bent
down
mechanically
picked
up
a
and
walked
on
approaching
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
my
hotel
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
tablet
upon
which
were
engraved
the
following
words
the
property
of
the
dead
flowers
are
the
property
of
the
dead
these
simple
words
made
a
very
great
impression
on
my
already
excited
mind
and
glancing
involuntarily
at
the
which
i
still
held
in
my
hand
my
heart
smote
me
for
having
carried
it
away
from
the
grave
i
was
on
the
point
of
returning
to
the
flower
when
an
indescribably
false
shame
prevented
my
doing
so
and
i
left
the
cemetery
with
the
rose
in
my
hand
on
returning
to
my
hotel
i
put
it
in
a
glass
of
water
and
placed
it
on
a
small
table
near
the
head
of
my
bed
upon
which
i
threw
myself
and
soon
fell
into
that
state
which
all
of
you
must
have
experienced
a
state
in
which
the
senses
hover
between
sleep
and
wakefulness
as
though
undecided
which
to
choose
suddenly
my
apartment
was
filled
by
a
bright
but
soft
light
without
my
being
able
to
perceive
whence
it
came
be
it
known
that
i
had
extinguished
my
candle
ere
long
the
door
of
my
room
was
opened
and
in
glided
noiselessly
a
pale
spectral
figure
clad
in
a
white
robe
and
wearing
a
garland
of
flowers
it
was
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
and
the
face
was
angelic
with
motionless
eyes
and
outstretched
hand
she
approached
my
couch
and
in
plaintive
voice
asked
me
hast
thou
robbed
the
dead
why
hast
thou
taken
that
flower
which
a
faithful
lover
threw
upon
my
last
on
earth
seemingly
my
pulses
ceased
to
beat
and
i
could
scarcely
breathe
the
phantom
then
stretched
forth
the
left
hand
and
took
the
rose
out
of
the
glass
and
with
the
right
hand
she
beckoned
to
me
saying
come
and
give
back
the
property
of
the
dead
respect
the
property
of
the
dead
come
follow
me
in
vain
i
tried
to
resist
i
arose
and
followed
the
figure
out
of
the
room
and
into
the
deserted
streets
it
was
not
dark
for
the
moon
was
at
her
full
and
shining
brightly
onward
stalked
the
figure
i
followed
her
towards
the
cemetery
we
arrived
at
the
gate
she
touched
it
it
opened
noiselessly
we
entered
she
led
me
to
the
grave
the
grave
from
which
i
had
taken
the
flower
with
trembling
hand
i
received
from
hers
the
rose
and
placed
it
on
the
very
spot
whence
i
had
removed
it
and
then
here
the
baron
paused
and
relighted
his
cigar
well
and
then
we
all
asked
then
replied
the
baron
i
awoke
that
is
to
say
if
i
had
ever
been
asleep
and
looking
in
the
tumbler
in
which
i
had
placed
the
rose
i
discovered
that
it
was
gone
the
chambermaid
possibly
or
the
waiter
who
may
have
entered
your
apartment
for
orders
may
have
seen
admired
and
carried
it
away
while
you
were
slumbering
suggested
the
lively
frenchman
and
a
very
lucky
fellow
you
were
not
to
have
missed
your
watch
and
your
purse
at
the
same
time
and
place
no
said
the
baron
shaking
his
head
perhaps
said
west
you
had
taken
more
wine
than
usual
no
was
the
reply
the
truth
is
that
the
story
i
have
related
to
you
was
written
by
that
great
austrian
wit
and
satirist
saphir
it
was
one
of
his
earlier
compositions
which
strange
to
say
were
all
of
a
very
melancholy
cast
saphir
however
to
this
day
asserts
that
his
story
of
death
rose
is
a
fact
and
that
it
happened
to
himself
one
by
one
we
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
slept
for
about
an
hour
and
on
awakening
the
frenchman
west
and
myself
almost
simultaneously
exclaimed
confound
your
death
rose
baron
for
the
truth
was
that
the
story
had
taken
possession
of
our
senses
while
we
were
asleep
i
thought
it
would
said
the
baron
laughing
everybody
dreams
of
the
death
rose
after
i
have
told
the
story
but
ah
see
in
the
distance
here
are
the
coolies
returning
i
can
make
out
my
on
the
head
of
one
man
ah
we
will
sing
plenty
of
songs
and
in
the
evening
the
baron
sang
for
several
hours
we
could
have
listened
to
him
all
night
some
of
the
most
sentimental
and
some
of
the
most
humorous
songs
that
i
had
ever
heard
fortunately
i
knew
enough
of
german
to
appreciate
them
and
my
friend
west
was
equally
fortunate
as
for
the
frenchman
he
understood
and
spoke
albeit
very
imperfectly
every
language
current
in
europe
on
that
night
we
retired
before
twelve
for
we
had
agreed
to
rise
and
proceed
early
on
the
morrow
in
pursuance
of
such
agreement
as
soon
as
the
day
dawned
we
struck
our
tents
packed
up
our
traps
loaded
the
coolies
and
set
out
for
a
place
called
demooltee
distant
some
fourteen
or
fifteen
miles
the
road
which
had
been
very
very
seldom
travelled
over
by
europeans
was
a
narrow
and
bad
road
winding
round
and
leading
over
lofty
peaks
some
ten
or
eleven
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
above
us
and
below
us
we
frequently
saw
herds
of
ghooral
and
other
deer
but
as
we
could
not
or
would
not
rather
have
stayed
to
pick
up
any
that
we
might
kill
we
suffered
them
to
graze
on
and
preserved
our
ammunition
by
the
way
we
saw
an
animal
which
none
of
as
had
ever
seen
before
an
animal
called
the
seron
it
is
a
species
of
chamois
but
larger
and
stronger
its
colour
was
reddish
and
it
had
a
quantity
of
stiff
short
hair
on
the
neck
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
hogged
mane
the
native
guides
told
us
that
it
was
a
very
shy
animal
and
only
to
be
found
where
there
was
a
great
quantity
of
wood
the
scenery
of
this
part
in
march
was
exceedingly
beautiful
and
varied
at
times
we
had
a
good
view
of
mussoorie
and
the
surrounding
country
at
other
times
we
moved
through
vast
forests
of
pine
and
woods
of
oak
rhododendron
and
other
magnificent
trees
in
the
midst
of
one
of
these
woods
our
was
situated
a
large
grassy
flat
bounded
on
either
side
by
a
deep
and
steep
precipice
while
in
every
direction
the
surrounding
mountains
which
locked
us
in
were
covered
thickly
with
trees
what
fools
men
are
exclaimed
the
baron
whilst
the
servants
were
unpacking
to
huddle
themselves
together
in
old
countries
when
lands
like
these
remain
uncultivated
and
unenjoyed
and
what
fools
are
those
travellers
who
go
year
after
year
gazing
on
comparatively
paltry
mountains
and
lakes
which
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
of
all
nations
have
beheld
when
such
fresh
and
gorgeous
scenery
as
this
may
be
looked
at
travelling
in
switzerland
and
italy
bah
but
my
dear
baron
said
the
frenchman
you
forget
that
the
peninsular
and
oriental
company
demand
four
pounds
a
day
for
conveying
you
from
england
to
india
in
consequence
they
say
of
the
dearness
of
coals
ah
well
laughed
the
baron
opening
with
his
own
hand
a
bottle
of
hock
and
emptying
the
contents
into
a
silver
tankard
if
you
regard
the
matter
in
an
economical
point
of
view
you
at
once
cut
short
my
argument
and
my
sentiment
egad
what
grapes
could
be
grown
on
yonder
hill
in
that
warm
valley
what
wine
could
be
grown
there
i
will
come
out
to
this
country
with
a
few
german
peasants
i
will
have
vineyards
i
will
make
a
fortune
so
colossal
that
rothschild
when
he
is
in
difficulties
will
have
to
write
to
me
yes
i
will
the
thing
is
to
be
done
and
i
will
do
it
but
you
forget
said
west
that
you
are
now
some
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
miles
from
the
nearest
calcutta
and
that
there
would
be
some
little
difficulty
in
transmitting
the
produce
to
europe
europe
europe
why
do
you
talk
of
europe
does
not
british
india
contain
enough
of
europeans
to
make
a
market
this
bottle
of
good
wine
which
we
are
going
to
drink
costs
twelve
shillings
in
this
country
i
could
grow
it
make
it
and
sell
it
for
one
shilling
a
bottle
ah
you
may
laugh
but
i
tell
you
this
is
the
fact
i
am
a
proprietor
of
vineyards
and
do
not
speak
at
random
like
a
schoolboy
or
an
enthusiast
the
natives
of
the
country
would
soon
learn
that
art
for
an
art
it
is
of
and
as
for
the
soil
it
is
superb
yes
grow
wine
which
would
do
your
soldiers
good
generous
wine
instead
of
that
arrack
your
horrible
grogs
and
your
beers
but
we
have
no
roads
baron
true
but
is
there
a
scarcity
of
labour
in
india
are
pickaxes
shovels
spades
saws
and
gunpowder
to
blast
rocks
so
expensive
that
a
government
can
not
procure
them
roads
my
good
sir
only
a
few
years
ago
there
was
no
road
over
the
spl√ºgen
the
time
was
when
you
had
no
road
from
calcutta
to
benares
you
have
no
roads
well
make
them
the
wine
and
the
tea
that
you
grow
will
more
than
pay
for
them
as
well
as
remunerate
the
growers
the
tea
asked
west
yes
the
tea
i
said
returned
the
baron
you
have
discovered
that
you
can
grow
tea
in
the
lower
range
of
these
mountains
and
you
do
grow
it
in
small
quantities
now
why
not
having
made
the
experiment
grow
it
in
quantities
i
would
say
to
chinaman
thank
you
very
much
but
i
do
not
want
any
more
of
your
tea
you
are
insolent
overbearing
and
insulting
in
your
dealings
with
me
and
now
you
may
drink
your
own
tea
and
i
will
drink
own
tea
and
if
you
like
you
may
stir
yours
with
your
own
pigtail
we
will
bring
china
into
our
own
dominions
for
god
has
given
to
this
climate
and
to
this
soil
the
same
properties
as
your
soil
and
climate
possess
i
do
not
say
it
as
you
know
with
any
sort
of
intention
to
offend
but
the
result
of
my
experience
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
government
of
this
country
is
in
all
matters
save
annexation
as
slow
as
the
government
of
the
dutch
was
in
days
there
is
a
listlessness
and
a
languor
about
its
movements
a
want
of
everything
in
the
shape
of
society
and
enterprise
and
seemingly
such
an
earnest
desire
to
discourage
the
efforts
of
those
who
would
in
reality
develop
the
resources
of
india
that
i
am
astonished
any
man
unconnected
with
the
services
should
persevere
in
the
attempt
to
make
a
living
in
the
eastern
british
dominions
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
west
especially
as
regards
that
portion
of
your
remarks
which
relates
to
the
obstacles
thrown
in
the
way
of
enterprising
englishmen
i
have
been
a
member
of
the
civil
service
for
nearly
ten
years
and
have
always
been
impressed
with
the
idea
that
the
policy
of
the
government
in
respect
to
settlers
in
india
was
and
is
a
very
erroneous
policy
the
conversation
here
was
brought
abruptly
to
a
close
by
the
approach
of
one
of
the
guides
who
in
a
very
confidential
manner
imparted
to
us
that
there
was
a
kakur
a
barking
deer
grazing
on
a
crag
not
far
from
the
encampment
so
we
seized
our
guns
went
in
pursuit
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
kill
the
animal
his
bark
resembles
exactly
that
of
a
when
very
much
excited
on
our
return
to
the
encampment
we
encountered
a
huge
bear
and
succeeded
in
killing
and
carrying
him
to
the
door
of
our
tent
where
the
natives
skinned
him
and
deprived
him
of
his
fat
which
they
boiled
down
and
used
in
the
lamps
instead
of
oil
and
very
brightly
did
it
burn
but
the
aroma
was
not
a
peculiarly
pleasant
one
i
am
afraid
to
say
how
much
grease
was
taken
from
this
enormous
bear
but
i
know
that
i
am
speaking
within
bounds
when
i
assert
it
was
in
excess
of
two
gallons
and
a
half
we
dined
at
dusk
and
then
as
usual
betook
ourselves
to
whist
but
so
cold
did
it
become
shortly
after
dark
that
we
were
forced
to
put
on
our
great
coats
notwithstanding
there
was
an
enormous
wood
fire
in
front
and
at
the
back
of
our
tent
these
fires
had
been
lighted
to
serve
another
purpose
beyond
that
of
giving
warmth
namely
to
scare
away
the
leopards
which
abounded
in
that
locality
it
was
a
very
picturesque
scene
the
white
tents
standing
out
in
relief
from
the
dark
wood
lighted
up
by
the
fires
and
here
and
there
groups
of
coolies
wrapped
up
in
blankets
and
sitting
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
blaze
at
daylight
on
the
following
morning
our
march
was
recommenced
we
had
a
distance
of
ten
miles
to
travel
before
we
could
reach
the
next
named
kanah
tall
during
this
march
we
did
not
go
out
of
our
way
for
game
but
only
took
such
as
chanced
to
cross
our
path
all
we
killed
was
ghooral
which
we
did
not
stop
to
look
at
even
and
two
braces
of
partridges
of
very
peculiar
plumage
they
were
remarkably
handsome
birds
with
a
red
mark
round
the
eye
and
down
each
side
of
the
neck
feathers
on
their
backs
and
their
wings
and
breasts
covered
with
white
and
red
spots
we
could
not
fail
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
which
flourished
in
this
locality
the
ground
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
and
wild
road
was
literally
covered
with
violets
and
a
lily
of
the
valley
and
other
little
decorations
of
the
earth
of
which
i
know
not
the
name
throughout
the
whole
march
the
scene
was
truly
kanah
tall
was
only
five
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
therefore
very
much
warmer
than
our
last
of
this
we
were
by
no
means
sorry
not
only
for
our
own
sakes
but
for
the
sakes
of
our
personal
servants
who
had
never
before
travelled
out
of
the
plains
here
at
kanah
tall
we
found
the
english
holly
growing
botanists
may
tell
me
what
they
please
about
this
holly
of
the
himalayas
bearing
a
distinctive
character
but
i
say
it
was
the
english
holly
the
same
sort
of
holly
that
i
saw
last
christmas
in
almost
every
house
in
london
and
in
the
country
here
at
kanah
tall
we
shot
no
less
than
seven
elks
these
deer
are
very
plentiful
hereabouts
and
do
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
the
crops
of
the
poor
villagers
at
harvest
time
ghooral
and
kakur
also
abound
here
we
were
so
tired
on
the
evening
that
we
stopped
at
kanah
tall
that
we
could
not
sit
up
to
play
at
whist
we
actually
fell
asleep
over
our
second
rubber
and
by
general
consent
threw
our
cards
upon
the
table
and
sought
our
beds
the
next
day
at
three
we
arrived
at
a
place
called
jullinghee
ten
miles
distant
from
kanah
tall
jullinghee
is
a
large
village
situated
on
the
right
bank
of
the
bhagaruttee
a
stream
that
flows
direct
from
gungootrie
and
is
in
consequence
one
of
the
most
sacred
streams
that
compose
the
mighty
and
holy
ganges
we
were
encamped
beneath
a
clump
of
apricot
and
walnut
trees
but
it
was
frightfully
hot
for
we
were
now
not
more
than
a
couple
of
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
woods
however
were
exceedingly
beautiful
and
diversified
not
only
were
there
apricot
walnut
rhododendrons
oaks
hollies
and
other
trees
of
the
higher
altitudes
but
also
the
tamarind
the
the
pomegranate
and
others
of
the
plains
at
this
village
we
procured
some
honey
which
is
taken
from
its
makers
in
a
very
singular
manner
the
bees
build
in
cavities
in
the
walls
of
the
houses
which
are
closed
within
by
a
moveable
board
and
are
only
entered
by
the
bees
by
a
small
aperture
from
without
when
the
owners
of
the
houses
want
honey
they
darken
the
interior
of
the
house
and
removing
the
board
which
forms
the
back
part
of
the
hive
extract
as
much
as
they
require
the
bees
during
this
process
fly
out
into
the
light
to
discover
their
enemies
who
then
close
the
back
part
of
the
hive
and
remain
safely
within
doors
until
the
wrath
of
the
bees
has
subsided
in
the
evening
we
took
a
walk
in
the
village
of
jullinghee
which
appeared
to
be
rich
and
populous
but
very
dirty
our
arrival
had
caused
a
great
stir
and
there
was
a
large
concourse
of
people
near
our
tents
to
look
at
us
a
short
distance
from
the
village
were
the
ruins
of
several
houses
which
once
formed
a
separate
hamlet
but
which
had
been
deserted
for
fear
of
a
ghost
which
was
said
to
haunt
it
the
same
effect
of
superstition
is
by
no
means
uncommon
in
the
plains
of
india
there
is
a
very
curious
instance
in
the
meerut
district
a
village
had
long
been
deserted
under
the
idea
that
it
was
haunted
by
a
fakir
the
settlement
officer
however
with
much
difficulty
prevailed
upon
a
neighbouring
zemindar
to
farm
the
land
at
something
like
a
nominal
revenue
shortly
afterwards
the
zemindar
presented
himself
to
the
settlement
officer
and
represented
that
he
had
been
very
ill
and
that
the
visitation
was
ascribed
by
his
friends
and
by
himself
to
his
impiety
in
interfering
with
haunted
lands
the
settlement
officer
however
talked
to
him
and
insisted
on
his
keeping
his
engagements
and
once
more
did
he
venture
to
brave
the
ghost
so
complete
was
his
success
that
the
village
shortly
became
one
of
the
most
flourishing
in
the
district
and
the
very
relatives
who
had
been
foremost
in
reproaching
the
zemindar
for
his
impiety
brought
a
suit
against
him
in
one
of
the
local
courts
to
recover
a
share
of
his
large
profits
on
the
day
following
we
marched
to
a
place
called
teree
a
large
straggling
village
situated
on
a
plain
of
some
extent
at
the
junction
of
the
billung
and
bhagaruttee
rivers
a
regular
hot
wind
was
blowing
here
and
our
tents
were
unbearable
so
we
threw
ourselves
beneath
the
shade
of
a
huge
tree
which
grew
on
the
banks
of
the
billung
and
which
served
also
as
a
shelter
for
a
party
from
srinugger
who
were
celebrating
the
marriage
festival
of
a
bunneah
of
some
years
of
age
with
a
young
lady
of
eight
the
little
damsel
was
on
the
ground
and
did
ample
justice
to
the
marriage
dinner
which
consisted
of
rice
butter
sweetmeats
and
a
goat
roasted
whole
a
goat
which
had
been
decapitated
by
one
blow
and
cooked
without
any
sort
of
preparation
beyond
the
removal
of
the
entrails
it
was
not
even
skinned
portions
of
this
feast
were
distributed
on
plantain
leaves
to
each
guest
by
the
brahmins
who
officiated
as
cooks
and
waiters
teree
is
the
residence
of
a
rajah
named
soodersain
saha
whose
family
before
the
goorkha
invasion
ruled
over
the
provinces
of
gurhwal
and
sirmoor
and
indeed
over
the
whole
hill
country
as
far
as
simlah
and
from
the
snowy
range
to
the
plains
expelled
by
the
goorkhas
he
sought
refuge
with
the
british
and
after
defeating
the
goorkhas
was
replaced
by
us
in
the
greater
part
of
his
territories
a
part
of
them
we
retained
as
the
price
of
our
assistance
namely
a
portion
of
gurhwal
the
whole
of
dehra
dhoon
and
a
part
of
the
terai
and
we
hold
landour
and
mussoorie
from
him
at
a
nominal
annual
rent
the
rajah
is
extremely
civil
to
europeans
and
the
moment
he
heard
of
our
arrival
he
sent
a
deputation
to
wait
upon
us
the
deputation
brought
with
them
a
variety
of
presents
consisting
of
milk
sweetmeats
dried
flour
dried
fruits
and
a
couple
of
goats
the
deputation
gave
us
to
understand
that
it
would
afford
the
rajah
very
great
pleasure
to
make
our
personal
acquaintance
and
we
were
just
on
the
point
of
starting
for
his
highness
abode
when
his
arrival
was
unexpectedly
announced
to
us
at
srinugger
in
a
portion
of
the
country
we
took
from
him
is
situated
the
family
palace
a
handsome
and
substantial
building
this
is
rather
a
sore
point
with
the
old
rajah
and
as
he
considers
the
more
modern
abode
which
he
now
inhabits
beneath
his
dignity
he
prefers
going
to
see
any
one
with
whom
he
is
desirous
of
having
an
interview
having
caused
chairs
to
be
placed
in
the
front
of
our
tents
we
advanced
to
meet
the
rajah
who
dismounting
from
a
large
cabul
horse
joined
us
shook
hands
with
us
very
cordially
and
remained
with
us
for
upwards
of
an
hour
he
was
a
very
small
and
rather
an
old
man
active
and
intelligent
he
talked
to
us
about
the
goorkha
war
of
which
he
had
been
a
spectator
in
the
british
camp
and
he
was
very
eloquent
on
punjab
politics
and
greatly
praised
lena
singh
whom
he
described
as
very
far
in
advance
of
any
of
his
countrymen
in
point
of
humanity
civilization
and
prudence
the
little
man
told
us
amongst
other
things
that
he
was
thinking
of
having
an
iron
over
the
bhagaruttee
but
that
he
could
not
find
an
engineer
and
that
his
applications
to
the
government
although
he
was
ready
to
defray
every
expense
had
not
met
with
any
reply
the
present
bridge
is
a
sling
or
swing
and
constructed
in
the
following
manner
two
lines
of
coir
rope
each
consisting
of
a
number
of
smaller
ropes
are
suspended
from
the
rocks
on
either
side
of
the
stream
and
apart
from
each
other
about
four
feet
from
these
ropes
depend
at
intervals
of
about
two
feet
smaller
lines
or
ropes
about
three
or
four
feet
deep
these
support
slight
wooden
ladders
the
ends
of
which
are
lashed
firmly
to
one
another
the
whole
affair
has
a
very
frail
appearance
and
at
first
it
requires
no
small
amount
of
nerve
to
step
from
ring
to
ring
of
the
ladder
over
that
roaring
torrent
beneath
of
course
this
bridge
is
only
passable
by
men
cattle
and
mules
swim
across
the
river
much
higher
up
where
the
torrent
is
not
so
rapid
we
asked
the
rajah
where
he
had
got
his
idea
of
an
iron
suspension
bridge
and
he
replied
from
a
which
was
given
to
me
by
a
gentleman
who
was
out
on
a
shooting
excursion
some
years
ago
in
these
hills
we
stayed
two
days
at
teree
and
despite
the
heat
enjoyed
ourselves
amazingly
our
next
encampment
ground
was
at
a
place
called
pon
a
march
of
eleven
miles
our
route
at
first
lay
along
the
south
bank
of
the
billung
river
and
then
up
a
deep
glen
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
whose
summit
was
some
five
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
the
monotony
of
this
day
journey
was
broken
by
meeting
with
another
marriage
party
some
of
whom
carried
parasols
of
evidently
chinese
manufacture
and
made
out
of
painted
paper
we
shot
also
several
green
pigeons
a
very
different
bird
from
the
green
pigeons
of
the
plains
and
much
better
eating
we
also
met
a
pilgrim
and
his
wife
on
their
way
to
gungootree
the
source
of
the
ganges
both
of
them
were
painted
and
bedaubed
after
the
most
grotesque
fashion
the
frenchman
took
a
sketch
of
this
couple
and
i
have
heard
that
it
now
adorns
an
album
in
the
possession
of
the
empress
of
the
french
our
next
march
was
to
a
place
called
tekowlee
where
we
halted
beneath
the
shade
of
some
large
trees
and
near
the
banks
of
a
clear
stream
of
water
on
one
side
of
the
stream
there
grew
a
quantity
of
wild
mint
some
of
which
we
gathered
and
cooled
preparatory
to
using
it
for
cup
there
is
a
village
near
tekowlee
and
a
gosains
house
or
monastery
which
is
inhabited
by
a
large
number
of
this
sect
we
visited
and
entered
into
conversation
with
them
the
building
was
composed
of
a
large
square
surrounded
by
a
range
of
barracks
or
rather
cells
the
lower
story
of
which
is
protected
by
a
verandah
the
place
was
full
of
men
women
and
children
the
gosains
being
the
only
monastic
order
who
are
permitted
by
their
tenets
to
marry
we
had
been
out
sixteen
days
before
we
reached
loba
near
to
which
place
the
commissioner
of
kumaon
resides
during
the
rains
and
the
autumn
his
bungalow
is
built
upon
the
spur
of
a
hill
of
considerable
length
and
there
is
a
good
quantity
of
flat
ground
in
the
vicinity
not
far
from
the
bungalow
is
an
old
fort
a
goorkha
stronghold
which
commanded
the
pass
leading
to
almorah
it
is
chiefly
celebrated
however
as
the
place
where
moorcroft
and
hearsey
were
discovered
on
their
return
from
the
munsarowar
lake
whither
they
had
gone
disguised
as
bairagis
and
so
well
had
they
sustained
their
characters
that
they
would
have
returned
undetected
had
not
a
rumour
of
their
attempt
reached
the
ears
of
the
authorities
and
excited
their
vigilance
they
were
harshly
treated
for
some
days
but
eventually
released
on
a
promise
that
they
would
return
direct
and
without
delay
to
the
british
territories
the
commissioner
was
not
at
the
bungalow
when
we
arrived
west
however
knew
him
sufficiently
well
to
warrant
our
taking
possession
of
it
for
the
day
after
a
residence
for
some
time
in
tents
a
house
is
a
very
agreeable
change
on
leaving
loba
we
came
upon
the
pilgrim
road
constructed
by
a
former
commissioner
of
kumaon
to
facilitate
the
progress
of
the
pilgrims
to
the
sacred
places
within
the
british
himalayas
it
was
a
very
humane
project
for
many
of
the
unfortunate
pilgrims
used
formerly
overcome
by
the
difficulties
of
the
route
to
lie
down
and
perish
by
the
of
these
pilgrims
we
met
swarms
hundreds
if
not
thousands
and
with
some
we
occasionally
stopped
to
converse
our
encamping
ground
at
which
we
arrived
at
four
in
the
afternoon
was
a
short
distance
from
a
village
called
guniah
our
tents
were
pitched
beneath
a
clump
of
trees
and
close
to
a
clear
stream
called
the
ram
gunga
in
which
we
caught
a
quantity
of
fish
with
a
there
are
some
mines
between
loba
and
kumaon
but
we
did
not
go
out
of
our
way
to
visit
them
here
an
accident
happened
to
the
baron
he
sprained
his
ankle
and
could
not
walk
so
the
next
morning
we
put
him
into
a
dandi
and
he
was
carried
along
the
road
by
four
of
the
coolies
a
dandi
is
a
pole
upon
which
is
hung
by
its
two
ends
which
are
gathered
together
a
piece
of
cloth
or
canvas
open
in
the
centre
this
forms
a
hollow
seat
not
a
particularly
comfortable
one
until
you
get
accustomed
to
it
when
the
motion
is
rather
pleasurable
than
otherwise
during
this
day
march
we
shot
a
quantity
of
black
partridge
a
hill
fox
a
deer
and
a
wild
dog
of
enormous
size
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
loba
we
sighted
our
then
destination
the
town
of
almorah
on
nearing
the
place
we
came
upon
a
hill
to
the
right
which
bears
the
name
of
brown
hill
so
called
after
an
officer
of
the
native
infantry
who
in
the
goorkha
war
volunteered
to
take
it
with
his
company
though
it
had
a
stockade
on
the
top
which
was
obstinately
defended
and
he
did
take
it
after
a
very
severe
loss
a
monument
is
erected
on
this
hill
to
the
memory
of
those
who
fell
in
the
engagement
a
little
further
on
is
a
large
tree
now
used
as
a
gallows
this
tree
was
the
scene
of
a
occurrence
just
after
the
battle
a
goorkha
shot
through
the
leg
had
fallen
here
the
fighting
over
a
british
officer
was
standing
over
him
and
giving
directions
to
a
party
of
sepoys
to
have
him
taken
to
the
hospital
when
raising
himself
with
his
left
hand
with
his
right
he
cut
the
officer
down
with
his
kookeree
a
deadly
weapon
with
which
the
little
goorkhas
now
chop
up
the
rebels
apropos
of
a
kookeree
in
the
hands
of
a
goorkha
i
must
relate
a
little
matter
which
i
now
know
to
be
a
fact
but
which
i
could
scarcely
credit
when
it
was
first
told
to
me
a
party
of
goorkhas
say
fifteen
or
twenty
will
proceed
to
a
jungle
in
which
they
know
there
is
a
huge
tiger
they
will
surround
the
jungle
form
a
circle
and
closing
in
gradually
hem
in
the
ferocious
beast
every
man
will
then
drop
down
on
the
right
knee
as
soldiers
do
forming
a
square
and
kookeree
in
hand
wait
for
the
spring
of
the
tiger
who
becomes
somewhat
bewildered
and
anxious
to
make
his
escape
after
moving
about
for
a
brief
while
in
this
den
of
which
the
bars
are
human
beings
about
five
feet
high
and
glaring
first
at
one
and
then
at
another
he
lashes
himself
into
a
fury
and
makes
his
spring
then
the
nearest
goorkha
delivers
a
blow
with
his
kookeree
which
divides
the
tiger
skull
wonderful
as
this
feat
is
i
once
saw
at
jutog
near
simlah
a
sight
that
struck
me
as
even
more
wonderful
a
goorkha
battalion
was
and
now
is
quartered
at
jutog
there
was
a
festival
at
which
the
goorkhas
sacrifice
an
ox
the
adjutant
of
the
battalion
asked
me
if
i
should
like
to
witness
the
ceremony
as
it
was
something
new
to
me
i
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
we
walked
to
the
parade
ground
where
the
whole
regiment
in
undress
was
assembled
and
surrounding
the
victim
and
the
executioner
the
ox
was
forced
to
kneel
and
by
the
side
of
him
knelt
the
little
goorkha
armed
with
the
kookeree
which
is
nothing
more
than
a
huge
curved
knife
but
very
heavy
and
as
sharp
as
a
razor
at
a
given
signal
he
struck
the
ox
immediately
behind
the
hump
over
the
shoulder
peculiar
to
all
indian
cattle
and
the
body
was
divided
into
two
parts
he
had
with
a
single
blow
gone
though
the
ox
just
as
completely
and
as
cleanly
as
a
butcher
with
his
hatchet
would
remove
a
chop
from
a
loin
of
mutton
they
are
a
very
odd
race
of
people
those
little
goorkhas
wonderfully
honest
even
among
themselves
almost
to
childishness
capable
of
enduring
any
amount
of
toil
obedient
and
respectful
without
cringing
to
fawning
on
or
flattering
their
superior
the
white
man
the
great
blot
upon
their
characters
is
their
frightful
jealousy
of
their
wives
woe
betide
the
woman
who
gives
her
goorkha
husband
the
faintest
reason
to
suspect
her
of
infidelity
he
at
once
takes
the
law
and
the
kookeree
into
his
own
hands
and
slays
both
the
wife
and
her
real
or
supposed
gallant
i
am
glad
to
say
this
is
not
a
frequent
occurrence
though
it
does
happen
now
and
then
as
a
body
the
goorkha
women
are
as
virtuous
as
their
husbands
are
honest
and
brave
the
commissioner
of
kumaon
received
us
at
almorah
his
with
great
cordiality
and
kindness
and
offered
us
rooms
in
his
house
this
offer
we
declined
inasmuch
as
our
party
consisted
of
four
and
his
house
was
not
a
large
one
besides
he
had
other
visitors
who
were
putting
up
at
his
bungalow
we
accepted
however
his
invitation
to
dine
and
on
our
way
rode
through
the
town
which
is
considered
the
best
in
the
british
hill
possessions
bishop
heber
writes
that
almorah
reminds
him
of
chester
it
consists
of
one
street
about
a
mile
and
a
half
long
and
about
sixty
feet
wide
paved
with
large
slabs
of
slate
and
closed
at
either
end
by
a
gate
one
half
of
the
town
is
much
higher
than
the
other
and
the
street
is
divided
in
the
middle
by
a
low
flight
of
steps
on
which
the
ponies
pass
up
and
down
with
extraordinary
the
houses
are
small
but
neat
and
whitewashed
they
all
consist
of
two
or
more
stories
the
lower
ones
are
shaded
by
wooden
verandahs
more
or
less
carved
at
one
end
of
the
town
is
the
old
goorkha
fort
at
the
other
end
fort
moira
a
small
english
fortification
near
to
which
were
the
sepoy
lines
a
neat
little
church
has
just
been
erected
at
almorah
the
people
of
the
place
are
all
and
some
of
the
children
as
white
as
those
born
of
european
parents
returning
at
almorah
i
parted
company
with
my
foreign
friends
they
intended
crossing
the
mountains
the
snowy
range
to
pay
a
visit
to
kanawur
this
was
a
journey
for
which
i
had
not
much
inclination
besides
i
was
doubtful
whether
i
could
breathe
at
an
elevation
of
eighteen
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
as
it
was
several
of
the
coolies
died
of
cold
and
the
rarity
of
the
atmosphere
in
fact
both
of
my
friends
themselves
had
as
they
informed
me
afterwards
a
very
narrow
escape
on
several
occasions
they
were
compelled
to
huddle
themselves
amongst
the
coolies
in
their
tent
and
the
sheep
which
they
were
taking
with
them
for
food
were
kept
alive
for
the
sake
of
the
warmth
they
could
impart
in
the
canvas
abode
the
grandeur
of
the
scenery
they
said
would
defy
any
attempt
at
describing
it
what
they
most
wondered
at
was
the
impudence
of
that
insect
man
in
daring
to
climb
up
into
such
regions
my
friend
the
assistant
magistrate
had
still
a
fortnight
of
unexpired
leave
and
proposed
to
me
that
we
should
pay
a
visit
to
a
friend
of
his
at
an
station
called
bijnore
i
had
not
the
least
objection
and
thither
we
went
we
were
most
hospitably
received
partly
out
of
regard
for
ourselves
in
particular
but
chiefly
because
our
host
had
not
seen
a
white
face
for
five
weeks
the
cutcherry
or
was
undergoing
repair
and
the
magistrate
therefore
was
obliged
to
administer
the
duties
of
his
office
in
his
own
abode
or
rather
in
the
verandah
for
a
large
number
of
natives
in
a
hot
country
do
not
impart
to
a
confined
space
an
agreeable
perfume
by
any
means
to
me
this
scene
the
native
court
was
particularly
interesting
there
sat
the
covenanted
official
in
an
with
his
solah
hat
on
and
a
cheroot
in
his
mouth
listening
very
attentively
to
the
sheristadar
or
head
clerk
who
was
reading
or
singing
aloud
the
entire
proceedings
in
the
case
then
pending
the
prisoner
surrounded
by
native
policemen
all
with
drawn
swords
was
standing
ten
paces
off
ever
and
anon
he
interrupted
the
court
by
protesting
his
innocence
and
assuring
the
sahib
that
the
whole
of
the
depositions
were
false
from
beginning
to
end
this
interruption
was
usually
i
may
say
invariably
rebuked
by
the
words
choop
raho
suer
hold
your
tongue
you
pig
and
not
unfrequently
the
nearest
policeman
accompanied
this
mandate
by
giving
the
culprit
a
smart
blow
on
the
back
or
a
dig
in
the
ribs
i
have
seen
prisoners
well
thrashed
in
our
indian
courts
of
justice
by
order
of
the
presiding
magistrate
for
talking
out
of
their
turn
but
that
was
not
the
case
in
the
present
instance
no
more
violence
was
resorted
to
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
order
and
the
progress
of
the
trial
the
offence
of
which
the
prisoner
stood
charged
was
that
of
forging
a
bond
for
five
hundred
rupees
and
suing
thereon
for
principal
and
interest
the
defence
was
that
the
signature
to
the
bond
was
not
a
forgery
and
that
the
money
had
been
advanced
to
the
prosecutor
to
prove
which
no
fewer
than
seven
witnesses
were
called
each
of
them
swore
point
blank
that
upon
a
certain
day
and
at
a
certain
place
they
saw
the
prisoner
pay
over
the
money
and
saw
the
prosecutor
execute
the
deed
to
rebut
this
the
prosecutor
called
eleven
witnesses
who
swore
point
blank
that
upon
the
day
and
at
the
hour
mentioned
as
the
day
and
hour
on
which
the
deed
was
executed
they
met
the
prosecutor
at
a
village
forty
miles
distant
from
bijnore
in
short
if
their
testimony
was
to
be
relied
upon
the
eleven
witnesses
had
proved
an
alibi
this
was
one
of
those
cases
which
happen
continually
in
courts
of
justice
in
india
where
the
magistrate
or
judge
must
not
be
and
is
not
guided
by
the
oaths
of
the
witnesses
but
entirely
by
circumstances
it
is
one
of
those
cases
too
in
which
it
would
be
dangerous
to
consult
the
native
officers
of
the
court
for
having
received
bribes
from
both
parties
their
advice
would
be
dictated
entirely
by
pecuniary
considerations
with
them
the
question
would
be
simply
out
of
which
party
the
accused
or
the
prosecutor
could
most
money
be
got
in
the
event
of
guilty
or
not
guilty
with
regard
to
the
characters
of
the
witnesses
they
are
pretty
equal
and
generally
very
bad
on
both
sides
indeed
in
nearly
all
these
cases
the
witnesses
are
professionals
that
is
to
say
men
who
are
accustomed
to
sell
their
oaths
and
who
thoroughly
understand
their
business
they
know
exactly
what
to
say
when
they
come
into
court
just
as
an
actor
who
is
letter
perfect
in
his
part
knows
what
to
say
when
he
comes
on
the
boards
in
fact
a
case
is
got
up
exactly
as
a
play
is
each
man
has
his
particular
part
and
studies
it
separately
before
the
day
of
trial
comes
they
meet
and
rehearse
and
go
through
the
business
till
they
verily
believe
such
is
my
opinion
that
they
are
not
perjured
but
are
speaking
the
truth
as
for
shaking
the
testimony
of
men
so
trained
to
speak
to
a
certain
string
of
facts
i
would
defy
the
most
eminent
nisi
prius
advocate
in
europe
besides
even
if
you
should
reject
one
part
of
a
statement
it
does
not
follow
in
a
native
court
that
you
should
reject
the
whole
the
price
paid
to
these
professional
witnesses
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
the
nature
and
magnitude
of
the
cause
it
is
about
twelve
per
cent
out
of
the
sum
in
dispute
i
believe
it
is
distributed
amongst
the
witnesses
and
the
like
sum
amongst
the
native
officers
of
the
court
this
of
course
does
not
include
little
extra
presents
given
secretly
to
those
who
are
supposed
to
have
the
greatest
amount
of
influence
with
the
sahib
and
who
pretend
that
they
will
speak
to
him
favourably
the
personal
servants
also
of
the
european
magistrate
or
judge
expect
some
gratuity
and
hang
about
a
client
like
the
servants
of
badly
regulated
hotels
where
attendance
is
not
charged
in
the
bill
it
is
this
that
makes
litigation
so
expensive
in
india
that
even
the
successful
party
is
often
ruined
before
the
suit
is
half
concluded
tiffin
is
ready
sahib
said
the
khansamah
coming
into
the
verandah
and
placing
his
hands
together
in
a
supplicating
attitude
it
is
on
the
table
sahib
then
we
will
adjourn
said
the
magistrate
bowing
to
me
and
rising
this
was
at
once
the
signal
for
breaking
up
the
day
proceedings
the
tiffin
over
we
began
to
play
at
whist
and
continued
to
do
so
until
the
sun
had
lost
his
power
when
the
buggies
were
ordered
and
we
took
a
drive
in
couples
along
a
very
bad
road
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
be
the
companion
of
the
magistrate
a
very
able
and
excellent
man
one
of
the
most
efficient
officers
in
the
east
india
company
civil
service
he
was
moreover
an
admirable
linguist
and
spoke
hindostanee
as
well
as
any
native
you
understood
the
proceedings
he
asked
me
i
followed
them
yes
and
you
heard
the
evidence
yes
what
would
you
say
is
he
guilty
or
not
i
can
not
say
although
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
on
the
point
even
while
we
were
playing
whist
proceedings
were
uppermost
in
my
mind
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
that
either
one
side
or
the
other
is
perjured
both
sides
are
perjured
if
the
bond
be
genuine
the
men
who
really
witnessed
the
execution
and
who
subscribed
their
names
as
witnesses
will
not
come
forward
or
else
they
are
such
fools
that
the
native
lawyer
for
the
defence
will
not
trust
to
them
lest
they
should
be
confused
and
commit
themselves
but
what
do
you
think
is
the
bond
a
genuine
document
or
not
that
is
the
very
question
and
when
there
is
no
evidence
to
weigh
how
are
you
to
act
i
suppose
that
in
those
cases
you
give
the
prisoner
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
remarked
not
always
if
i
did
that
i
should
acquit
almost
every
culprit
that
is
brought
before
me
and
so
would
every
judge
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
by
the
way
about
a
year
ago
i
sent
a
case
to
the
sessions
judge
a
case
of
murder
i
fancied
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
accused
which
was
the
opinion
of
the
sessions
judge
and
of
the
sudder
court
of
appeal
the
man
was
hanged
about
six
weeks
ago
and
now
i
have
discovered
beyond
all
question
that
he
was
hanged
for
the
offence
of
which
his
prosecutor
was
guilty
it
may
be
all
very
well
for
people
in
england
to
rail
at
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
country
but
they
would
be
less
severe
upon
some
of
us
if
they
could
only
come
out
here
and
see
the
material
with
which
we
have
to
deal
the
administration
of
justice
may
be
i
confess
very
much
reformed
and
improved
but
where
the
great
bulk
of
the
people
are
corrupt
it
can
scarcely
be
in
anything
like
a
perfect
state
this
statement
remember
was
made
by
a
magistrate
who
speaks
as
well
as
writes
the
native
language
as
well
as
the
natives
themselves
but
conceive
the
confusion
and
injustice
in
those
courts
where
the
magistrates
solely
depend
on
corrupt
moonshees
for
what
they
know
of
the
evidence
there
is
but
very
little
twilight
in
india
and
by
the
time
that
we
had
returned
from
the
drive
it
was
dark
shortly
afterwards
dinner
was
announced
dinner
over
we
resumed
our
whist
and
played
until
midnight
the
following
day
was
a
native
holiday
a
hindoo
holiday
what
with
hindoo
holidays
and
mahommedan
holidays
nearly
a
third
of
every
year
is
wasted
for
upon
these
days
public
business
is
suspended
and
the
various
offices
closed
it
is
devoutly
to
be
hoped
that
when
our
rule
in
india
is
completely
these
absurd
concessions
these
mere
pretexts
for
idleness
will
no
longer
be
suffered
to
prevail
it
is
only
the
pampered
native
servants
of
the
government
civil
and
military
who
are
clamorous
for
the
observance
of
these
great
days
as
they
call
them
go
into
the
fields
or
ride
through
a
bazaar
on
one
of
these
holidays
and
you
will
see
the
people
at
their
work
and
the
shopkeepers
pursuing
their
respective
avocations
you
pass
the
the
treasury
the
magistrate
office
and
observe
that
they
are
all
shut
up
you
ask
the
reason
and
are
informed
that
it
is
a
native
holiday
you
go
to
an
establishment
founded
and
conducted
by
private
enterprise
a
for
instance
and
you
observe
hindoos
of
every
caste
and
mussulmans
also
at
their
daily
labour
why
because
the
head
of
such
an
establishment
stipulates
that
those
who
wish
for
employ
must
work
all
the
year
round
and
they
prefer
employ
on
such
terms
to
no
employ
at
all
so
it
is
in
some
mercantile
firms
in
calcutta
and
at
the
other
presidencies
albeit
such
firms
experience
very
great
inconvenience
from
the
circumstance
of
the
government
banks
being
closed
on
these
holidays
if
a
merchant
wishes
to
get
a
cheque
cashed
or
a
bill
discounted
he
must
wait
sometimes
for
days
together
even
the
doors
of
the
queen
courts
are
often
closed
and
the
judges
and
the
counsel
left
unemployed
notwithstanding
that
the
litigants
are
british
subjects
and
this
because
the
native
writers
in
these
courts
and
the
officers
attached
to
them
are
paid
by
the
company
government
which
recognises
absence
from
duty
on
these
holidays
it
would
be
hard
to
deprive
either
of
the
great
sects
of
certain
holidays
in
every
year
the
for
instance
or
the
mohurrum
but
it
is
sheer
folly
and
profitless
withal
to
sanction
these
constantly
repeated
interruptions
to
public
business
the
idlers
of
the
covenanted
civil
service
in
india
are
naturally
in
favour
of
closing
the
doors
of
the
various
offices
as
often
as
possible
but
the
portion
those
men
who
take
some
interest
in
the
discharge
of
the
duties
for
which
they
draw
their
pay
regard
the
native
holidays
as
an
intolerable
nuisance
which
ought
long
since
to
have
been
abolished
whilst
we
were
enjoying
ourselves
after
dinner
on
the
evening
of
the
hindoo
holiday
the
khansamah
came
in
and
announced
that
two
sahibs
had
arrived
two
sahibs
said
our
host
who
are
they
they
are
strangers
to
me
sahib
said
the
khansamah
and
they
do
not
speak
hindostanee
but
their
bearers
say
that
they
are
lord
sahibs
who
on
earth
can
they
be
said
the
magistrate
of
bijnore
loudly
to
himself
and
rising
he
left
the
table
to
make
inquiry
in
person
and
offer
the
travellers
every
hospitality
o
i
beg
your
pardon
said
a
voice
from
one
of
the
palanquins
but
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
where
i
am
you
are
at
bijnore
said
the
magistrate
blandly
bijnore
then
how
far
am
i
from
meerut
a
very
considerable
distance
forty
miles
at
least
how
the
deuce
is
that
well
sir
in
the
words
of
the
eton
latin
grammar
i
may
reply
felix
qui
potuit
rerum
cognoscere
causas
but
where
have
you
come
from
from
seharry
something
or
other
but
confound
these
nores
and
pores
and
bores
there
no
recollecting
the
name
of
any
place
for
an
hour
together
the
magistrate
i
forget
his
name
just
now
but
it
was
radley
bradley
bagley
ragley
or
cragley
or
some
such
name
told
me
he
would
push
me
on
to
meerut
and
here
am
i
it
seems
forty
miles
out
of
my
road
well
look
here
i
am
lord
jamleigh
indeed
well
you
are
welcome
to
some
refreshment
and
repose
in
my
home
in
common
with
your
friend
and
whenever
you
desire
to
be
on
i
will
exert
my
authority
to
the
utmost
to
further
your
views
o
thank
you
my
friend
is
my
valet
here
mexton
jump
out
and
take
my
things
into
a
room
while
mexton
is
obeying
this
order
and
while
his
lordship
is
following
his
host
let
us
inform
the
reader
who
his
lordship
was
and
what
was
the
object
of
his
mission
to
india
his
lordship
was
a
young
nobleman
who
was
about
to
enter
parliament
and
being
desirous
of
acquiring
information
concerning
india
in
order
to
be
very
strong
when
the
question
for
renewing
the
charter
came
on
in
eighteen
hundred
and
or
he
resolved
on
travelling
in
the
country
for
a
few
months
the
entire
period
of
his
absence
from
home
including
the
journey
overland
not
to
exceed
half
a
year
after
a
passage
of
days
having
already
seen
the
island
of
ceylon
and
approved
of
it
his
lordship
landed
at
madras
was
carried
up
to
government
house
where
he
took
a
hasty
tiffin
and
was
then
carried
back
to
the
beach
whence
he
reembarked
on
board
the
steamer
and
was
three
days
afterwards
landed
at
the
ghaut
in
calcutta
where
he
found
a
carriage
ready
to
convey
him
to
the
dwelling
after
two
days
stay
he
was
pushed
on
at
his
own
request
to
the
upper
provinces
his
destination
being
lahore
the
newspapers
got
hold
of
his
name
and
came
out
with
something
of
this
kind
amongst
the
passengers
by
the
is
lord
jamleigh
eldest
son
of
the
right
honourable
the
earl
of
dapperleigh
his
lordship
leaves
calcutta
this
evening
and
will
pass
through
the
following
stations
then
came
a
list
at
many
of
the
stations
he
was
met
officiously
met
by
gentlemen
in
authority
who
dragged
literally
dragged
him
in
their
anxiety
to
have
a
lord
for
a
guest
to
their
houses
and
kept
him
there
as
long
as
they
could
taking
care
to
have
the
journals
informed
of
where
and
with
whom
his
lordship
had
put
up
he
was
not
allowed
to
stay
at
a
d√¢k
bungalow
for
an
hour
or
two
and
then
proceed
taking
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
phrase
his
view
of
india
its
people
its
institutions
and
so
forth
some
of
them
threw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
his
getting
bearers
so
that
he
might
remain
with
them
for
hours
and
thus
thoroughly
impregnate
and
air
their
houses
with
an
aristocratical
atmosphere
others
lugged
him
to
their
courts
and
collectorates
albeit
he
had
seen
one
of
each
at
burdwan
and
bengal
and
consequently
had
seen
the
working
of
the
indian
judicial
and
revenue
departments
and
knew
all
about
them
this
sycophantic
importunity
of
a
few
government
officials
soured
his
lordship
temper
which
imparted
to
his
manners
a
rudeness
which
was
perhaps
foreign
to
his
nature
his
lordship
was
led
to
believe
that
indian
officials
were
a
parcel
of
sycophants
sycophants
and
hence
he
grew
to
treat
them
all
alike
and
he
did
not
scruple
at
last
to
extract
his
information
from
them
much
in
the
same
way
that
a
petulant
judge
who
has
lost
all
patience
with
a
rambling
witness
takes
him
out
of
the
hands
of
counsel
and
brings
him
sharply
to
the
point
for
instance
i
know
all
about
that
but
tell
me
this
in
hand
would
lord
jamleigh
in
such
wise
frequently
interrogate
his
civil
hosts
who
insisted
on
doing
themselves
the
honour
of
entertaining
his
lordship
the
fact
was
that
in
his
own
opinion
he
knew
all
about
india
and
its
affairs
long
before
he
touched
the
soil
for
he
had
read
a
good
deal
in
blue
books
and
newspapers
his
object
as
we
have
before
hinted
was
simply
to
see
the
country
and
travel
in
it
or
through
it
and
thus
arm
himself
with
a
tremendous
and
telling
weapon
in
a
contested
debate
should
he
take
part
therein
and
therefore
when
his
lordship
asked
questions
it
was
not
so
much
with
a
view
to
obtain
information
as
to
test
the
accuracy
of
that
already
acquired
by
reading
over
the
fireside
in
the
library
of
his
father
mansion
in
bagdad
square
thus
the
entries
in
his
lordship
were
after
all
merely
a
matter
of
form
having
divested
himself
of
the
dust
with
which
he
was
covered
and
having
restored
himself
to
his
personal
comforts
his
lordship
joined
our
little
party
and
partook
of
some
dinner
which
the
khansamah
had
prepared
for
him
his
repast
concluded
his
lordship
moistened
his
throat
with
a
glass
of
cool
claret
and
proceeded
in
his
own
manner
to
interrogate
his
host
who
was
not
only
an
accomplished
scholar
but
a
ready
and
refined
wit
it
was
thus
that
the
dialogue
was
commenced
and
continued
what
is
the
number
of
inhabitants
in
this
district
asked
the
noble
guest
upon
my
word
i
do
know
i
have
never
counted
them
said
the
host
but
have
you
no
idea
ca
you
give
a
guess
oh
yes
some
hundreds
of
thousands
ah
and
crime
much
crime
his
lordship
persevered
very
much
but
we
are
going
to
reduce
it
during
the
ensuing
exactly
and
per
answered
the
magistrate
looking
uncommonly
statistical
how
well
that
is
what
my
assistant
and
myself
have
decided
upon
i
do
not
understand
you
how
can
you
possibly
say
at
this
moment
whether
during
the
next
six
months
the
amount
of
crime
shall
be
greater
or
less
his
lordship
was
puzzled
how
why
just
in
the
same
way
that
the
directors
of
a
bank
determine
in
their
parlour
what
shall
be
the
amount
of
dividend
payable
to
shareholders
my
assistant
wanted
to
make
a
reduction
of
fifty
per
centum
on
the
last
returns
but
i
think
and
will
be
a
very
fair
figure
you
intend
perhaps
to
be
more
severe
said
the
young
legislator
nothing
of
the
kind
on
the
contrary
we
intend
to
be
less
energetic
by
and
per
to
take
matters
more
easily
in
short
i
wish
i
knew
what
you
meant
i
will
explain
it
to
you
as
briefly
as
possible
please
his
lordship
did
not
want
to
be
bored
evidently
by
all
means
i
only
want
facts
you
see
and
i
am
about
to
give
you
facts
dry
facts
well
the
facts
are
these
there
is
a
district
in
these
provinces
nearly
twice
the
size
of
this
and
it
contains
nearly
double
the
number
of
inhabitants
yes
during
the
past
the
number
of
convictions
in
that
district
has
been
very
much
less
than
the
number
of
convictions
in
this
district
and
the
sudder
court
of
appeal
has
come
to
the
conclusion
on
looking
at
the
figures
in
the
official
return
that
the
proportion
of
crime
to
population
in
this
district
is
greater
than
it
is
in
that
district
very
naturally
indeed
but
suppose
that
the
magistrate
of
that
district
only
attends
his
court
once
or
twice
and
then
only
for
an
hour
or
two
on
those
days
and
suppose
that
his
assistant
is
a
young
man
who
makes
sport
his
occupation
and
his
business
and
business
his
recreation
and
his
sport
and
suppose
that
i
and
my
assistant
work
hard
and
do
our
best
to
hunt
up
all
the
murderers
thieves
and
other
culprits
whom
we
hear
of
and
bring
them
to
justice
and
to
punishment
what
then
are
the
figures
in
the
official
returns
touching
the
convictions
to
be
taken
as
any
criterion
of
the
crime
perpetrated
in
our
respective
districts
his
worship
delivered
these
questions
triumphantly
in
that
case
certainly
not
well
the
sudder
have
looked
at
the
convictions
and
the
consequence
has
been
that
in
the
last
printed
report
issued
by
that
august
body
composed
of
three
old
and
imbecile
gentlemen
to
the
government
the
magistrate
of
that
district
and
his
assistant
have
been
praised
for
their
zeal
and
recommended
for
promotion
while
the
magistrate
and
assistant
of
this
district
have
been
publicly
censured
or
to
use
the
cant
phrase
of
the
report
up
for
the
consideration
of
the
most
noble
the
of
india
is
it
possible
asked
the
lord
throwing
up
his
hands
you
ask
for
dry
facts
and
i
have
given
you
dry
facts
may
i
make
a
note
of
this
pulling
out
an
elegant
souvenir
not
that
i
should
think
of
mentioning
your
name
you
may
make
a
note
of
it
and
so
far
as
mentioning
my
name
is
concerned
you
may
do
as
you
please
i
have
already
written
to
the
sudder
what
i
have
stated
to
you
was
the
answer
what
about
the
and
per
cent
yes
and
what
is
more
i
have
insisted
on
a
copy
of
the
letter
being
forwarded
to
the
and
what
will
be
the
result
do
you
suppose
i
neither
know
nor
care
i
have
just
served
my
time
in
this
penal
country
and
being
entitled
to
both
my
pardon
and
my
pension
i
intend
to
apply
shortly
for
both
the
reader
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
a
long
correspondence
ensued
on
this
subject
between
the
sudder
the
government
and
the
mutinous
magistrate
the
upshot
was
that
the
imbecile
old
men
who
had
too
long
warmed
that
tribunal
were
pushed
off
their
stools
by
the
lord
dalhousie
who
very
meritoriously
bullied
them
into
resigning
the
service
threatening
as
some
say
to
hold
a
commission
on
their
capacity
for
office
in
their
stead
were
appointed
three
gentlemen
whose
abilities
and
vigour
had
hitherto
been
kept
in
the
back
settlements
of
india
the
crowning
point
of
all
was
that
the
mutinous
magistrate
was
one
of
the
illustrious
three
lord
jamleigh
informed
us
that
he
had
seen
lahore
and
that
he
was
about
to
go
across
the
country
to
bombay
and
that
he
should
then
have
seen
all
three
presidencies
as
well
as
all
the
upper
provinces
and
the
punjab
he
regretted
half
apologetically
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
take
a
look
at
the
himalayas
simlah
and
mussoorie
but
the
fact
was
he
was
so
much
pressed
for
time
poor
devils
exclaimed
our
host
smiling
but
as
they
wo
know
anything
about
it
they
wo
feel
it
much
indeed
not
at
all
to
whom
are
you
alluding
asked
my
lord
the
himalayas
sighed
our
host
passing
the
claret
to
his
lordship
who
by
this
time
had
discovered
that
he
had
not
got
into
a
nest
of
sycophants
who
worshipped
a
title
no
matter
how
frivolous
or
how
insolent
the
man
might
be
who
wore
it
but
that
he
had
accidentally
fallen
into
the
company
of
persons
of
independent
character
and
albeit
they
were
desirous
of
giving
him
a
welcome
and
making
him
comfortable
being
a
stranger
who
had
lost
his
way
nevertheless
were
determined
to
make
him
pay
in
some
shape
for
the
want
of
courtesy
he
had
exhibited
when
the
bearers
set
his
palkee
down
at
the
door
of
the
bungalow
this
discovery
made
his
lordship
a
little
uncomfortable
and
rather
cautious
in
his
observations
he
felt
in
short
as
one
who
knows
that
he
has
committed
an
error
and
that
some
penalty
will
be
exacted
but
what
penalty
and
how
exacted
he
can
not
imagine
had
he
been
able
to
get
away
he
would
probably
have
taken
a
hasty
farewell
of
us
but
that
was
impossible
his
jaded
bearers
were
cooking
their
food
and
until
twelve
there
was
no
hope
of
getting
them
together
the
khansamah
came
in
with
a
fresh
bottle
of
wine
our
host
withdrawing
his
cigar
from
his
lips
inquired
of
him
if
the
wants
of
the
gentleman
servant
had
been
attended
to
yes
sahib
was
the
reply
and
have
you
given
him
any
champagne
no
sahib
then
do
oh
pray
do
nothing
of
the
kind
exclaimed
his
lordship
he
is
not
accustomed
to
it
then
he
will
enjoy
it
all
the
more
said
our
host
i
hope
he
is
taking
notes
and
will
write
a
book
on
india
i
should
much
like
to
see
his
impressions
in
print
and
he
may
possibly
dignify
me
by
devoting
a
few
lines
to
the
character
of
my
hospitality
it
is
to
be
hoped
however
that
should
his
travel
inspire
him
with
a
thirst
for
literary
distinction
he
will
confine
himself
to
a
personal
compilation
of
his
experience
and
not
go
into
judicial
or
revenue
matters
for
should
he
do
so
you
may
find
yourself
clashing
with
him
and
that
would
be
awkward
his
publisher
critic
might
be
inclined
to
break
a
spear
with
your
publisher
critic
in
their
respective
reviews
of
your
respective
works
and
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
conjecture
where
the
controversy
might
end
indisposed
as
i
am
generally
to
obtrude
my
advice
upon
any
one
and
much
less
on
a
perfect
stranger
i
nevertheless
feel
that
i
am
only
doing
you
a
kindness
when
i
say
that
if
i
were
you
i
would
regard
hindostan
as
a
sort
of
juan
fernandez
myself
the
crusoe
thereof
and
this
valet
as
my
man
friday
and
then
with
a
due
observance
of
that
line
of
demarcation
which
should
always
be
drawn
between
civilised
man
and
the
savage
i
would
not
permit
him
to
keep
even
a
stick
whereon
to
notch
the
day
or
time
of
any
particular
event
that
occurred
during
my
residence
in
the
country
lest
he
should
some
day
or
other
in
consequence
of
my
having
discharged
him
or
he
having
discharged
me
rise
up
and
instigate
some
man
or
other
to
call
in
question
the
accuracy
of
my
facts
the
wine
is
with
you
will
you
fill
and
pass
it
on
lord
jamleigh
became
very
red
in
the
face
and
rather
confused
both
in
manner
and
speech
as
for
myself
and
the
two
there
was
something
so
benignant
in
the
expression
of
our
handsome
and
dignified
countenance
something
so
quaintly
sarcastic
in
the
tone
and
manner
of
his
discourse
that
had
we
known
that
death
was
the
penalty
of
not
maintaining
the
gravity
of
our
features
our
lives
would
certainly
have
been
forfeited
a
silence
for
several
minutes
ensued
and
then
lord
jamleigh
spoke
to
our
host
as
follows
most
of
the
young
noblemen
who
come
to
this
country
come
only
to
travel
about
and
amuse
themselves
i
come
on
business
i
may
say
parliamentary
business
my
time
is
short
and
i
must
make
the
most
of
it
i
dare
say
when
you
saw
my
name
in
the
papers
as
having
arrived
in
india
you
little
thought
that
i
was
not
a
man
of
pleasure
and
excursion
upon
my
word
the
subject
never
once
became
a
matter
of
speculation
with
me
said
our
host
after
some
further
conversation
in
which
our
host
spared
his
visitor
as
little
as
was
consistent
with
good
breeding
lord
jamleigh
who
had
been
sitting
upon
thorns
rose
and
said
i
am
afraid
i
have
already
trespassed
on
your
goodness
too
long
i
will
not
attempt
to
apolo
apolo
or
to
express
how
much
how
much
nor
to
assure
you
that
assure
you
that
when
oh
pray
do
mention
it
said
our
host
smiling
you
desire
your
palkee
if
you
please
said
lord
jamleigh
the
palkee
was
ordered
and
we
were
standing
in
expectation
that
it
would
be
instantly
announced
as
ready
when
the
head
personal
attendant
came
into
the
room
in
a
state
of
excessive
trepidation
and
informed
us
that
the
sahib
sahib
lord
valet
was
drunk
asleep
and
refused
to
be
disturbed
on
any
pretence
whatever
this
announcement
which
caused
general
merriment
induced
lord
jamleigh
to
ejaculate
that
the
champagne
i
suspected
as
much
where
is
he
inquired
our
host
of
the
in
his
palkee
no
sahib
was
the
reply
he
is
lying
on
that
sahib
bed
pointing
to
me
here
again
everybody
laughed
except
myself
i
was
rather
angry
being
somewhat
particular
on
this
point
so
i
suggested
that
he
might
be
put
into
his
vehicle
at
once
the
native
servants
of
course
were
afraid
to
touch
him
lest
he
should
awake
and
hit
out
so
we
the
five
of
us
europeans
the
magistrate
the
two
assistant
magistrates
lord
jamleigh
and
myself
had
to
lift
remove
and
pack
in
his
palkee
the
overcome
and
perfectly
unconscious
valet
he
must
have
been
sipping
water
before
he
came
to
the
bungalow
for
he
had
only
half
finished
his
bottle
of
champagne
lord
jamleigh
now
got
into
his
palanquin
and
composed
himself
for
the
night
or
rather
the
remainder
of
it
and
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
as
to
his
lordship
destination
the
magistrate
sent
a
horseman
to
accompany
the
cort√®ge
with
directions
that
the
sahibs
were
to
be
taken
to
durowlah
on
the
road
to
meerut
and
to
the
house
of
the
magistrate
by
whom
lord
jamleigh
had
been
invited
or
rather
petitioned
to
stay
with
him
should
he
pass
through
that
station
and
to
use
his
lordship
own
terms
as
he
had
promised
to
do
so
he
supposed
that
he
must
keep
his
word
when
a
palanquin
is
escorted
by
a
sowar
the
sowar
when
the
destination
is
approached
rides
on
and
gives
notice
that
a
lady
or
gentleman
as
the
case
may
be
is
coming
and
as
the
natives
of
india
can
never
pronounce
european
names
properly
the
precaution
is
usually
taken
of
writing
down
the
name
of
the
traveller
on
a
card
or
a
slip
of
paper
and
giving
it
to
the
sowar
in
this
case
viscount
jamleigh
was
written
down
for
the
guidance
and
information
of
the
durowlah
functionary
it
was
about
seven
when
this
card
was
put
into
the
hands
of
the
gentleman
who
had
invited
lord
jamleigh
whom
by
the
way
he
had
never
seen
the
bungalow
was
immediately
all
life
and
in
commotion
the
servants
ordered
to
prepare
tea
and
coffee
the
best
vacated
by
the
present
occupants
hot
water
in
readiness
and
ere
long
a
palkee
a
single
palkee
loomed
in
the
distance
the
other
palkee
was
a
long
way
some
three
miles
behind
one
of
the
bearers
who
was
carrying
it
had
fallen
and
injured
himself
and
thus
was
a
delay
of
an
hour
and
a
half
occasioned
and
during
that
hour
and
half
a
pretty
mistake
was
committed
the
first
palkee
was
that
containing
the
valet
and
the
one
behind
was
that
of
his
lordship
the
valet
had
not
recovered
the
effects
of
his
potations
and
on
being
awakened
seemed
and
really
was
bewildered
and
stupified
so
much
so
that
he
could
not
inform
the
magistrate
that
he
was
only
a
servant
and
not
entitled
to
the
attentions
that
were
showered
upon
him
with
trembling
hand
he
took
the
cup
of
tea
from
the
silver
salver
and
gazing
wildly
round
murmured
rather
than
said
brandy
little
brandy
which
was
at
once
brought
and
administered
he
then
had
his
warm
wash
sat
down
on
the
best
bed
and
suffered
himself
to
be
punkahed
by
two
domestics
in
garments
this
revived
him
somewhat
but
still
he
felt
far
too
ill
to
talk
he
simply
shook
his
head
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
meaning
in
that
shake
if
the
magistrate
could
only
have
understood
it
take
some
brandy
and
my
lord
said
his
host
the
valet
nodded
assent
the
magistrate
mixed
the
dose
and
administered
it
with
his
own
hands
the
valet
sighed
and
again
shook
his
head
you
will
be
better
presently
my
lord
said
the
magistrate
drunk
as
a
lord
hiccuped
the
valet
o
no
my
lord
it
was
the
jolting
along
the
road
in
that
coffin
said
the
valet
who
now
began
to
regain
the
use
of
his
tongue
yes
my
lord
am
i
a
lord
he
he
he
where
am
i
at
durowlah
my
lord
and
who
are
your
host
my
lord
then
this
is
not
the
not
exactly
my
lord
give
us
a
little
drop
more
of
that
last
brew
yes
my
lord
ah
thank
you
i
feel
better
now
much
better
it
was
that
champagne
good
it
was
though
what
place
was
that
we
were
at
bijnore
my
lord
i
not
a
lord
would
that
i
were
in
your
place
my
lord
well
it
is
a
bad
place
grinned
the
valet
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
little
to
do
and
good
wages
but
hang
this
hindyer
it
was
a
mistake
altogether
the
magistrate
took
this
for
fun
laughed
immensely
and
then
said
we
had
lord
frederick
pontasguieure
staying
with
us
for
a
week
last
winter
a
very
amusing
character
he
was
o
had
you
was
he
amusing
o
we
do
keep
his
company
do
know
him
i
give
a
note
to
be
in
piccadilly
at
this
moment
this
is
a
nice
mess
but
the
traps
are
all
right
i
see
there
the
and
the
and
the
little
recline
upon
the
bed
my
lord
and
have
a
gentle
sleep
the
punkah
you
will
find
will
very
speedily
lull
you
to
repose
well
i
will
said
the
valet
and
soon
fell
fast
asleep
the
venetians
were
then
closed
and
the
house
kept
as
quiet
as
possible
when
lord
jamleigh
himself
arrived
and
established
his
identity
the
scene
that
ensued
may
be
easily
imagined
the
magistrate
with
a
marvellous
want
of
tact
acknowledged
the
mistake
that
he
had
made
told
in
fact
the
whole
uncomplimentary
truth
lord
jamleigh
and
perhaps
with
reason
was
dreadfully
annoyed
at
the
idea
that
the
servant
should
have
been
mistaken
for
himself
but
he
let
out
however
that
that
was
the
third
time
the
thing
had
happened
and
that
in
future
he
should
insist
upon
the
fellow
wearing
livery
instead
of
plain
clothes
and
a
black
hat
the
valet
was
speedily
lifted
out
of
the
best
bed
and
transferred
to
another
apartment
where
he
slept
himself
sober
and
arose
at
about
one
to
explain
to
his
lordship
that
he
was
not
much
in
fault
i
would
advise
all
noblemen
and
gentlemen
who
like
lord
jamleigh
would
take
a
look
at
india
not
to
travel
with
an
european
servant
who
in
that
country
is
as
helpless
as
an
infant
and
quite
as
troublesome
besides
being
in
the
way
of
everybody
in
every
house
it
is
moreover
cruel
to
the
servant
he
can
talk
to
no
one
and
becomes
perfectly
miserable
miscellaneous
the
house
of
a
civilian
a
magistrate
and
collector
in
the
heart
of
a
district
such
as
bijnore
is
really
worthy
of
contemplation
with
the
exception
of
a
bungalow
which
is
usually
occupied
by
the
assistant
and
which
may
therefore
be
said
to
belong
to
the
magistrate
house
there
is
no
other
christian
abode
within
or
forty
miles
the
house
is
usually
well
but
not
extravagantly
furnished
the
walls
are
adorned
with
prints
and
pictures
and
the
shelves
well
stored
with
books
in
a
word
if
the
punkahs
and
the
venetian
blinds
the
and
sundry
other
indian
peculiarities
were
removed
you
might
fancy
yourself
in
some
large
in
england
there
was
at
bijnore
a
native
moonshee
who
was
a
very
good
scholar
and
as
i
was
anxious
to
read
hindostanee
and
persian
with
him
the
more
especially
as
i
much
enjoyed
the
society
of
mine
host
and
his
assistant
i
was
induced
to
accept
an
invitation
to
remain
for
a
month
during
this
period
i
studied
for
several
hours
besides
attending
the
court
house
regularly
to
listen
to
the
proceedings
and
acquire
some
knowledge
of
a
most
extraordinary
jargon
composed
of
a
little
hindostanee
a
little
persian
and
a
good
deal
of
arabic
this
jargon
is
known
in
india
as
the
language
of
the
courts
a
good
persian
and
hindostanee
scholar
can
not
understand
it
unless
he
is
accustomed
to
it
many
magistrates
and
judges
have
insisted
upon
having
pure
hindostanee
spoken
but
to
no
purpose
up
to
a
recent
period
persian
mixed
with
arabic
was
the
language
in
which
legal
proceedings
were
conducted
persian
and
arabic
being
as
foreign
languages
to
the
people
of
india
as
english
german
or
french
and
when
the
order
went
forth
that
hindostanee
was
to
be
used
the
native
officers
of
the
courts
and
the
native
lawyers
who
practised
therein
complied
with
it
by
putting
a
hindostanee
verb
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
and
using
the
hindostanee
pronouns
retaining
in
all
their
integrity
or
rascality
the
persian
and
arabic
adverbs
prepositions
nouns
adjectives
and
conjunctions
an
indigo
planter
in
tahoot
who
spoke
hindostanee
perfectly
having
lived
amongst
the
natives
for
upwards
of
twenty
years
assured
me
that
he
did
not
comprehend
a
single
sentence
of
a
decree
in
court
hindostanee
that
he
heard
read
out
to
him
a
decree
in
a
case
to
which
he
was
a
party
what
is
even
more
absurd
each
court
has
its
own
peculiar
jargon
so
that
the
magistrate
or
judge
who
from
long
experience
has
acquired
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
jargon
of
his
own
court
has
very
great
difficulty
in
comprehending
the
jargon
of
another
court
this
might
be
altered
by
fining
any
officer
of
court
or
native
lawyer
who
in
matters
connected
with
a
suit
used
words
and
phrases
unintelligible
to
the
mass
of
the
people
but
the
order
would
have
to
emanate
from
government
no
magistrate
or
judge
would
venture
on
even
an
attempt
to
bring
about
so
desirable
a
reform
whilst
at
bijnore
i
was
seized
with
an
attack
of
and
suffered
all
its
extreme
agonies
one
of
my
host
servants
informed
me
that
there
was
a
very
clever
native
doctor
in
the
village
who
could
immediately
assuage
any
pain
for
instance
and
he
begged
permission
to
bring
him
to
see
me
i
consented
the
native
doctor
was
a
tall
thin
mussulman
with
a
lofty
forehead
small
black
eyes
long
aquiline
nose
and
finely
chiselled
mouth
and
chin
his
hair
and
long
beard
were
of
a
yellowish
white
or
cream
colour
standing
before
me
in
his
he
was
about
the
most
singular
looking
person
i
ever
beheld
his
age
did
not
exceed
or
years
he
put
several
questions
to
me
but
i
was
in
too
great
pain
to
give
him
any
replies
he
begged
of
me
to
sit
down
i
obeyed
him
mechanically
seating
himself
in
a
chair
immediately
opposite
to
me
he
looked
very
intently
into
my
eyes
after
a
little
while
his
gaze
became
disagreeable
and
i
endeavoured
to
turn
my
head
aside
but
i
was
unable
to
do
so
i
now
felt
that
i
was
being
mesmerized
observing
i
suppose
an
expression
of
anxiety
if
not
of
fear
on
my
features
he
bade
me
not
to
be
alarmed
i
longed
to
order
him
to
cease
but
as
the
pain
was
becoming
less
and
less
acute
and
as
i
retained
my
consciousness
intact
i
suffered
him
to
proceed
to
tell
the
truth
i
doubt
whether
i
could
have
uttered
a
sound
at
all
events
i
did
not
make
the
attempt
presently
that
is
to
say
after
two
or
three
minutes
the
pain
had
entirely
left
me
and
i
felt
what
is
commonly
called
all
in
a
glow
the
native
doctor
now
removed
his
eyes
from
off
mine
and
inquired
if
i
were
better
my
reply
which
i
had
no
difficulty
in
giving
at
once
was
in
the
affirmative
in
short
that
i
was
completely
cured
observing
that
he
placed
his
hands
over
his
head
and
pressed
his
skull
i
asked
him
if
he
were
suffering
yes
slightly
was
his
reply
but
i
am
so
accustomed
to
it
it
gives
me
but
little
inconvenience
i
then
begged
of
him
to
explain
to
me
how
it
was
that
he
had
the
power
to
afford
me
such
miraculous
relief
that
he
said
he
was
unable
to
do
he
did
not
know
i
then
talked
to
him
of
mesmerism
and
of
the
wonderful
performances
of
esdaile
in
the
calcutta
hospital
he
had
lately
heard
of
mesmerism
he
said
but
years
before
he
heard
of
it
he
was
in
the
habit
of
curing
people
by
assuaging
their
pain
the
gift
had
been
given
to
him
soon
after
he
attained
manhood
that
with
one
exception
and
that
was
in
the
case
of
a
keranee
a
no
patient
had
ever
fallen
asleep
or
had
become
beehosh
unconscious
under
his
gaze
the
case
of
the
he
went
on
to
say
alarmed
me
he
fell
asleep
and
slept
for
twelve
hours
snoring
like
a
man
in
a
state
of
intoxication
i
was
not
the
first
european
he
had
operated
upon
he
said
that
in
bareilly
where
he
formerly
lived
he
had
afforded
relief
to
many
officers
and
to
several
ladies
some
had
some
some
other
pains
but
he
exclaimed
energetically
the
most
extraordinary
case
i
ever
had
was
that
of
a
sahib
who
had
gone
mad
delirious
his
wife
would
not
suffer
him
to
be
strapped
down
and
he
was
so
violent
that
it
took
four
or
five
other
sahibs
to
hold
him
i
was
sent
for
and
at
first
had
great
difficulty
with
him
and
much
trembling
at
last
however
i
locked
his
eyes
up
as
soon
as
i
got
him
to
look
at
me
and
kept
him
for
several
hours
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
during
which
time
he
had
no
brandy
no
wine
no
beer
and
though
he
did
not
sleep
he
had
a
good
long
rest
i
stayed
with
him
for
two
days
and
whatever
i
told
him
to
do
he
did
immediately
he
had
great
sorrow
on
his
mind
poor
man
three
of
his
children
had
died
of
fever
within
one
short
week
and
he
had
lost
much
money
by
the
failure
of
an
in
calcutta
there
was
a
cattle
serjeant
too
an
european
whom
i
also
cured
of
that
drinking
madness
by
locking
up
his
eyes
what
do
you
mean
by
locking
up
his
eyes
well
what
i
did
with
you
i
locked
up
your
eyes
when
i
got
his
eyes
fixed
on
mine
he
could
not
take
them
away
could
not
move
but
can
you
lock
up
any
one
eyes
in
the
way
that
you
locked
up
mine
no
not
everybody
there
was
an
artillery
captain
once
who
defied
me
to
lock
up
his
eyes
i
tried
very
hard
but
instead
of
locking
up
his
he
locked
up
mine
and
i
could
not
move
till
he
permitted
me
and
there
was
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
judge
who
had
pains
in
the
head
which
i
could
not
cure
because
she
locked
up
my
eyes
with
her
i
trembled
much
by
straining
every
nerve
but
it
was
of
no
use
do
you
know
any
other
native
who
has
the
same
power
that
you
possess
only
three
but
i
dare
say
there
may
be
hundreds
in
these
provinces
who
have
it
and
who
use
it
and
now
sahib
said
the
native
doctor
taking
from
his
kummerbund
the
cloth
that
encircles
the
waist
a
bundle
of
papers
i
desire
to
show
you
some
of
my
certificates
at
the
same
time
to
beg
of
you
to
pardon
my
apparent
want
of
respect
in
appearing
in
your
presence
in
this
instead
of
a
turban
but
the
fact
is
that
when
i
heard
you
were
in
such
great
pain
i
did
not
think
it
humane
to
delay
until
i
had
adorned
myself
i
proceeded
to
examine
very
carefully
every
one
of
his
many
certificates
not
that
i
was
in
any
way
interested
in
them
but
because
i
knew
it
would
afford
him
great
pleasure
in
all
they
were
quite
as
numerous
as
those
which
english
charlatans
publish
in
testimony
of
their
skill
in
extracting
corns
they
were
more
elaborate
however
for
it
is
by
the
length
of
a
certificate
that
a
native
judges
of
its
value
just
in
the
same
way
that
partridge
when
tom
jones
took
him
to
see
admired
the
character
of
the
king
because
he
spoke
louder
than
any
of
the
company
anybody
could
see
that
he
was
a
king
as
for
myself
i
sat
down
and
covered
a
whole
sheet
of
foolscap
in
acknowledgment
of
my
gratitude
to
mustapha
khan
bahadoor
for
having
delivered
me
from
unendurable
torments
to
my
certificate
i
pinned
a
cheque
on
the
bank
for
one
hundred
rupees
ten
pounds
and
presenting
both
documents
to
the
doctor
permitted
him
to
take
his
leave
some
months
afterwards
on
discovering
that
this
cheque
had
not
been
presented
for
payment
i
wrote
to
the
and
asked
him
as
a
favour
to
send
for
the
native
doctor
and
obtain
some
information
on
the
subject
in
reply
i
was
informed
that
the
doctor
preferred
keeping
the
cheque
appended
to
my
certificate
as
an
imperishable
memorial
of
the
extraordinary
value
in
which
his
services
had
been
held
by
an
european
gentleman
and
that
he
would
not
part
with
it
for
ten
times
the
amount
in
gold
or
silver
such
a
strange
people
are
the
natives
of
india
their
cupidity
is
enormous
certainly
but
their
vanity
i
am
speaking
of
the
better
class
is
even
greater
one
hundred
rupees
was
equal
to
half
a
year
earnings
of
the
native
doctor
and
yet
he
preferred
holding
the
useless
autograph
of
an
insignificant
sahib
like
myself
for
the
amount
rather
than
realize
it
the
native
doctor
evidently
reasoned
thus
i
might
spend
the
one
hundred
rupees
might
not
be
believed
if
i
made
the
assertion
that
i
had
received
it
but
here
is
the
voucher
some
may
imagine
that
he
kept
it
as
a
sort
of
but
this
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
was
not
the
case
i
was
now
about
to
leave
bijnore
and
as
time
was
of
no
object
to
me
i
made
up
my
mind
to
travel
no
more
by
palkee
or
horse
d√¢k
but
in
the
most
independent
and
comfortable
manner
i
therefore
provided
myself
with
two
small
tents
and
two
camels
to
carry
them
two
bullocks
to
carry
the
tent
furniture
my
baggage
and
stores
a
pony
for
my
own
riding
and
a
similar
animal
for
a
boy
khitmutghur
who
was
also
my
personal
servant
or
bearer
i
engaged
also
a
cook
and
a
sweeper
or
general
helper
so
that
when
the
sawans
camel
drivers
the
and
the
syces
grooms
were
included
my
establishment
numbered
in
all
eight
servants
whose
pay
in
the
aggregate
amounted
to
fifty
rupees
five
pounds
per
mensem
this
of
course
included
their
keep
for
they
provided
themselves
with
food
the
expense
of
keeping
the
camels
the
bullocks
and
the
ponies
was
in
all
rupees
three
pounds
fifteen
shillings
per
mensem
while
my
own
expenses
including
everything
except
beer
and
cheroots
were
not
in
excess
of
fifty
rupees
per
month
so
that
i
was
thus
enabled
to
travel
about
india
at
a
cost
of
not
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
per
annum
or
two
hundred
and
pounds
at
the
very
outside
the
reader
must
remember
that
in
almost
every
one
of
the
villages
in
india
fowls
eggs
rice
flour
native
vegetables
curry
stuff
and
milk
are
procurable
and
at
very
small
prices
if
your
servants
do
not
cheat
you
and
mine
did
not
for
i
made
an
agreement
with
my
boy
khitmutghur
to
that
effect
indeed
i
entered
into
a
regular
contract
with
him
previous
to
starting
touching
the
purchase
of
every
article
that
would
be
required
during
my
journey
this
boy
was
in
short
my
commissariat
department
his
name
was
shumsheer
a
word
signifying
in
the
persian
language
a
sword
but
he
generally
went
by
the
name
of
sham
he
had
been
for
several
months
in
the
service
of
the
assistant
magistrate
of
bijnore
who
as
a
very
great
favour
permitted
the
boy
to
accompany
me
on
my
travels
he
was
so
clever
so
sharp
so
intelligent
and
so
active
a
servant
he
was
not
more
than
sixteen
and
very
short
for
his
age
but
stoutly
built
and
as
strong
as
a
young
lion
he
was
moreover
very
and
had
for
a
native
of
hindoostan
a
very
fair
complexion
he
had
been
for
several
years
the
servant
or
page
of
an
officer
on
the
staff
of
a
and
he
spoke
english
with
considerable
fluency
but
with
an
idiom
so
quaint
that
it
was
amusing
in
the
last
degree
to
listen
to
him
he
had
been
spoilt
in
one
sense
of
the
word
while
at
government
house
not
only
by
his
own
master
but
by
the
whole
staff
who
had
encouraged
him
to
give
his
opinions
on
all
subjects
with
a
freedom
which
was
at
first
very
disagreeable
to
me
but
ere
long
i
too
encouraged
him
to
do
so
his
opinions
were
so
replete
with
such
strong
common
sense
and
were
expressed
in
such
an
original
fashion
if
an
inquiry
touching
a
certain
administration
had
been
called
for
by
parliament
what
an
invaluable
witness
would
that
boy
have
been
before
a
committee
of
either
house
provided
he
had
not
been
previously
tampered
with
when
all
my
preparations
had
been
completed
i
took
leave
of
my
friends
and
left
bijnore
at
three
one
morning
my
destination
was
umballah
i
did
not
take
the
main
road
but
a
shorter
cut
across
the
country
conducted
by
a
guide
who
knew
the
district
well
and
who
was
enjoined
to
procure
for
me
another
guide
as
soon
as
his
information
failed
him
by
seven
we
had
travelled
over
twelve
miles
of
ground
and
as
the
sun
was
beginning
to
be
very
warm
i
commanded
a
halt
our
tents
were
then
pitched
beneath
a
tope
cluster
of
whose
branches
formed
a
dense
shade
having
bathed
breakfasted
smoked
and
read
several
pages
of
a
persian
book
i
fell
asleep
and
was
not
awakened
until
noon
when
sham
came
into
my
tent
and
reported
that
there
was
an
abundance
of
black
partridge
in
the
neighbourhood
he
then
proposed
that
i
should
dine
early
at
one
and
at
half
past
four
take
my
gun
and
permitting
him
to
take
another
sally
forth
in
search
of
the
game
to
this
proposal
i
at
once
assented
and
removing
my
camp
stool
to
the
opening
of
my
little
hill
tent
i
looked
out
into
the
fields
where
i
saw
some
men
ploughing
for
the
first
time
during
my
travels
i
was
struck
with
the
appearance
of
the
instrument
which
the
natives
use
for
tilling
the
soil
an
instrument
which
in
fact
closely
resembles
that
used
by
the
romans
according
to
the
directions
laid
down
in
the
georgics
curvi
formam
adcipit
ulmus
aratri
and
at
first
i
felt
some
surprise
that
an
implement
so
apparently
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
designed
should
answer
all
the
requirements
of
the
cultivator
the
substitution
of
the
english
plough
for
this
native
h√πr
has
been
several
times
projected
by
gentlemen
who
were
zealous
in
the
cause
of
agriculture
but
without
any
success
or
reasonable
hope
thereof
for
when
we
consider
the
cheapness
and
the
great
amount
of
labour
always
available
the
general
lightness
of
the
soil
the
inaptitude
of
the
natives
of
india
for
great
or
continued
physical
exertion
the
inferiority
of
the
cattle
all
of
which
are
the
marked
characteristics
of
india
it
would
not
only
be
undesirable
but
impossible
to
introduce
the
english
plough
generally
as
an
implement
of
husbandry
an
implement
requiring
physical
strength
manual
dexterity
and
a
superior
breed
of
cattle
for
draught
rude
and
simple
as
the
native
h√πr
is
or
as
it
may
seem
to
the
casual
observer
cursorily
viewing
the
operation
of
ploughing
it
has
still
many
good
qualities
which
render
it
peculiarly
suited
to
the
genius
of
the
indian
cultivator
and
it
is
not
in
any
immediate
endeavour
to
improve
it
or
alter
it
that
any
real
benefit
can
be
conferred
on
the
cause
of
indian
agriculture
all
the
efforts
therefore
that
have
been
made
in
that
direction
have
been
time
and
trouble
expended
to
no
purpose
it
has
been
said
that
all
improvement
to
be
real
must
be
spontaneous
or
take
rise
within
itself
and
it
would
seem
to
be
more
reasonable
to
improve
such
means
and
appliances
as
the
natives
use
and
understand
without
running
counter
to
the
ideas
and
shocking
the
prejudices
which
they
entertain
by
endeavouring
to
compel
their
adoption
of
european
modes
of
culture
which
however
well
suited
to
the
land
of
their
origin
have
not
the
quality
most
necessary
to
their
practicability
that
of
being
comprehensible
to
the
people
of
india
the
true
end
of
agriculture
with
artful
toil
to
and
tame
the
stubborn
soil
to
give
dissimilar
yet
fruitful
lands
the
grain
or
herb
or
plant
that
each
demands
is
best
to
be
attained
by
aiding
and
assisting
the
development
of
those
resources
of
the
soil
which
have
already
been
made
visible
by
the
people
themselves
here
it
is
that
the
duty
of
the
government
begins
the
precariousness
of
the
land
tenure
is
one
of
the
greatest
impediments
to
the
outlay
of
capital
by
the
tenant
in
the
improvement
of
the
land
and
as
there
is
but
little
prospect
of
the
removal
of
this
objection
the
government
should
fulfil
what
would
were
the
case
different
be
the
obvious
plans
of
the
landholder
in
developing
the
resources
of
the
soil
irrigation
and
manure
are
the
two
great
points
most
deserving
of
attention
on
both
points
the
resources
of
the
country
are
incalculable
the
advantages
evident
and
immediate
both
require
system
and
an
outlay
of
capital
which
the
zemindar
native
landholder
is
often
unable
and
oftener
unwilling
to
adopt
and
incur
from
want
of
confidence
in
the
administration
of
the
law
and
the
law
itself
with
the
ryot
or
cultivator
the
case
is
very
different
the
law
or
the
administration
thereof
affects
him
in
a
very
slight
degree
compared
with
the
zemindar
the
land
tenure
matters
very
little
to
him
his
rights
have
been
secured
he
profits
by
the
outlay
of
capital
on
the
land
risk
he
has
none
his
advantage
is
immediate
but
he
does
not
possess
the
means
of
improvement
in
any
way
he
may
build
a
well
dig
a
tank
or
plant
a
grove
to
the
memory
of
a
departed
ancestor
and
by
so
doing
enhance
the
value
of
the
land
to
the
zemindar
but
he
almost
always
ruins
himself
by
the
act
leaving
his
debts
to
be
paid
by
his
descendants
and
the
well
tank
or
grove
mortgaged
to
the
banker
for
the
extra
expenses
incurred
in
its
establishment
it
behoves
an
enlightened
government
to
do
for
the
people
and
the
country
what
they
are
unable
to
do
for
themselves
an
inquiry
properly
set
on
foot
and
undertaken
by
competent
persons
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
investigate
all
particulars
regarding
the
state
of
agriculture
would
bring
to
light
many
facts
which
if
made
fitting
use
of
would
not
only
greatly
redound
to
the
honour
but
adduce
greatly
to
the
advantage
and
profit
of
the
state
the
information
thus
acquired
and
not
founded
on
the
reports
of
native
government
collectors
police
officers
and
peaons
messengers
but
ascertained
by
the
personal
inspection
of
european
officials
and
from
the
opinions
of
the
zemindars
and
cultivators
themselves
would
enable
the
government
to
know
and
devise
remedies
to
obviate
the
evils
arising
out
of
the
gradual
decline
of
the
agricultural
classes
in
our
earliest
occupied
territories
it
would
show
the
government
many
places
where
the
expenditure
of
four
or
five
thousand
rupees
four
or
five
hundred
pounds
in
the
repairs
or
erection
of
a
dam
for
the
obstruction
of
some
nullah
a
wide
and
deep
ditch
would
yield
a
return
yearly
of
equal
amount
besides
affording
employment
and
the
means
of
livelihood
to
hundreds
of
persons
it
would
show
where
the
opening
of
a
road
or
the
building
of
a
bridge
involving
but
a
small
expenditure
would
give
a
new
life
to
a
part
of
the
country
hitherto
forgotten
and
render
the
inhabitants
flourishing
and
happy
by
throwing
open
to
them
a
market
for
their
produce
a
market
at
present
out
of
their
reach
it
would
prove
incontestably
that
the
means
of
irrigation
the
true
of
india
has
been
even
more
neglected
than
the
of
that
in
comparison
with
the
united
states
sluggish
colony
canada
the
initial
step
once
taken
the
march
of
improvement
once
fairly
set
on
foot
private
enterprise
duly
encouraged
will
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
government
and
capital
once
invested
land
in
india
will
become
intrinsically
valuable
and
thus
obtain
the
attention
it
merits
agricultural
improvement
would
induce
lasting
and
increasing
prosperity
of
the
cultivating
classes
the
bulk
of
the
population
and
of
the
country
itself
what
sham
dinner
ready
i
exclaimed
on
observing
the
boy
approaching
the
tent
with
a
tray
and
a
oh
yes
sir
quite
ready
and
very
good
dinner
what
have
you
got
stewed
duck
sir
curry
sir
pancake
sir
and
by
the
time
you
eat
that
one
little
quail
ready
sir
with
toast
i
give
dinner
fit
for
a
sir
and
the
silver
shining
like
the
moon
sir
it
was
in
this
way
that
he
ran
on
whilst
laying
the
table
but
why
are
you
preparing
covers
for
two
when
i
am
dining
alone
yes
sir
but
only
poor
mans
has
table
laid
for
one
that
place
opposite
is
for
company
sake
and
suppose
some
gentleman
come
not
likely
here
but
suppose
then
all
is
ready
no
running
about
no
calling
out
plate
knife
and
fork
and
spoon
and
glass
and
all
that
and
if
two
plates
laid
master
if
he
like
when
i
am
standing
behind
his
chair
keeping
the
flies
off
while
he
eats
may
fancy
that
some
friend
or
some
lady
sitting
opposite
and
in
his
own
mind
he
may
hold
some
guftoogoo
conversation
that
why
i
lay
the
table
for
two
sir
i
had
been
warned
by
the
gentleman
who
permitted
sham
to
accompany
me
that
he
was
such
an
invaluable
servant
it
was
only
politic
to
let
him
have
his
own
way
in
trifling
matters
and
therefore
instead
of
objecting
to
his
proceeding
i
applauded
his
foresight
whilst
discussing
the
stewed
duck
which
was
excellent
as
was
indeed
every
dish
prepared
by
sham
when
he
had
his
own
way
and
while
he
was
standing
behind
me
keeping
the
flies
off
with
a
chowrie
a
quantity
of
long
horsehair
fastened
to
a
handle
i
talked
to
him
without
turning
my
head
you
say
you
wish
to
take
a
gun
have
you
ever
been
out
shooting
oh
yes
sir
when
my
master
went
up
from
calcutta
to
mussoorie
and
simlah
with
the
i
went
with
him
and
i
often
went
out
shooting
in
the
dhoon
with
my
master
who
was
a
great
sportsman
sir
and
i
was
out
with
my
master
on
the
same
elephant
when
the
shot
the
tiger
what
did
the
shoot
a
tiger
oh
no
sir
but
my
master
and
the
other
gentlemens
make
him
think
he
did
sir
explain
yourself
well
sir
the
said
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
tiger
shooting
and
should
like
to
see
some
for
once
so
my
master
who
was
a
very
funny
gentleman
went
to
an
officer
in
the
dhoon
another
very
funny
gentleman
and
between
them
it
was
agreed
that
his
lordship
should
shoot
one
tiger
and
so
they
sent
out
some
native
shikarees
huntsmen
told
them
to
wound
but
not
kill
one
big
tiger
in
the
jungle
and
leave
him
there
and
the
native
shikarees
did
shoot
one
big
tiger
in
the
jungle
and
they
came
and
made
a
report
where
he
was
lying
then
next
morning
when
all
the
elephants
and
gentlemens
was
ready
and
the
had
his
gun
in
his
hand
they
all
went
to
the
jungle
and
when
they
got
to
the
place
and
heard
the
tiger
growl
very
angrily
my
master
called
out
my
lord
there
he
is
take
your
shot
and
my
lord
fired
his
gun
and
my
master
cried
out
very
loud
lord
you
hit
him
and
my
lord
who
was
very
much
confused
not
being
a
sportsman
said
i
and
all
the
gentlemens
cried
out
my
lord
and
then
some
of
the
gentlemens
closed
round
the
tiger
and
killed
him
by
firing
many
bullets
at
him
and
my
lord
had
the
tiger
skin
taken
off
and
it
was
sent
to
england
to
be
make
a
carpet
for
my
lord
and
for
many
days
all
the
gentlemens
laughed
and
asked
of
one
another
shot
the
tiger
and
the
was
so
happy
and
so
proud
and
wore
his
head
as
high
as
a
but
he
had
enough
of
in
that
one
tiger
for
he
was
not
a
sportsman
and
did
not
like
the
jolting
of
the
elephant
in
the
jungle
my
repast
ended
and
the
removed
i
lighted
a
cigar
and
took
my
once
more
to
the
opening
of
the
tent
when
to
my
surprise
and
somewhat
to
my
dismay
i
found
myself
besieged
by
a
host
of
ryots
cultivators
of
the
soil
each
bearing
a
present
in
the
shape
of
a
basket
of
fruit
or
vegetables
or
a
brass
dish
covered
with
almonds
raisins
and
native
sweetmeats
these
poor
creatures
who
doubtless
fancied
that
i
was
a
sahib
in
authority
possibly
sham
had
told
them
that
i
was
a
commissioner
a
very
great
man
on
a
tour
of
inspection
prostrated
themselves
at
my
feet
and
in
the
most
abject
manner
imaginable
craved
my
favour
and
protection
i
promised
each
and
every
one
of
them
with
much
sincerity
that
if
ever
it
lay
in
my
power
to
do
them
a
service
they
might
depend
upon
my
exerting
myself
to
the
utmost
and
then
i
made
a
variety
of
inquiries
touching
their
respective
ages
families
circumstances
and
prospects
in
order
to
prove
that
i
had
already
taken
an
interest
in
them
i
then
asked
them
some
questions
touching
the
game
in
the
locality
and
was
glad
to
hear
the
report
made
by
sham
confirmed
to
the
letter
i
was
assured
that
the
light
jungle
in
the
rear
of
my
tents
literally
swarmed
with
black
partridges
it
was
now
nearly
time
to
go
out
and
in
the
course
of
two
hours
i
brought
down
no
less
than
seven
brace
while
sham
distinguished
himself
by
killing
five
birds
by
the
time
i
returned
to
my
tent
i
was
weary
and
retired
to
rest
having
previously
given
orders
that
i
was
to
be
called
at
two
insomuch
as
at
that
hour
i
intended
to
resume
the
march
it
is
one
thing
however
to
retire
to
rest
but
it
is
another
thing
to
sleep
what
with
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
in
a
neighbouring
tank
and
the
buzzing
and
biting
of
the
musquitoes
in
my
tent
i
could
not
close
an
eye
i
lay
awake
the
whole
night
thinking
thinking
of
a
thousand
things
but
of
home
chiefly
and
right
glad
was
i
when
sham
approached
my
bed
holding
in
one
hand
a
cup
of
very
hot
and
strong
coffee
and
in
the
other
my
while
the
noise
outside
incident
on
the
striking
of
the
tents
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
little
camp
was
as
the
sweetest
music
to
my
ears
forward
i
was
twelve
days
marching
from
bijnore
to
umballah
and
by
keeping
away
from
the
i
did
not
see
during
my
journey
a
single
european
face
i
moved
entirely
amongst
the
people
or
rather
the
peasantry
of
the
upper
provinces
of
india
a
very
poor
and
very
ignorant
peasantry
but
comparatively
speaking
civil
and
honest
sham
made
a
much
greater
impression
upon
them
than
i
did
mounted
on
his
pony
and
dressed
in
very
gay
attire
a
purple
velvet
tunic
pyjamahs
of
red
silk
trimmed
with
gold
lace
a
turban
of
very
gorgeous
aspect
and
shoes
embroidered
all
over
with
silver
he
had
more
the
appearance
of
a
young
rajah
or
prince
than
a
gentleman
servant
and
sham
talked
to
his
countrymen
if
the
wretched
hindoos
could
be
so
called
in
a
lofty
strain
which
vastly
amused
me
though
i
did
not
approve
of
it
i
said
nothing
however
as
for
the
camp
arrangements
he
had
completely
taken
them
out
of
my
hands
and
he
was
so
much
better
manager
than
myself
that
i
was
well
content
that
it
should
be
so
all
that
was
left
to
me
was
to
name
the
hour
for
departing
from
an
and
the
next
spot
whereon
i
wished
my
tents
pitched
it
was
past
six
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
when
i
came
within
a
few
miles
of
umballah
the
mornings
and
the
nights
were
still
cool
but
in
the
day
the
heat
was
beginning
to
be
very
severe
however
after
taking
my
coffee
and
making
my
toilet
i
caused
my
pony
to
be
and
followed
by
sham
mounted
on
his
pony
rode
into
the
cantonments
inquiring
my
way
as
i
went
along
of
the
various
servants
who
were
moving
about
i
eventually
found
myself
at
the
door
of
a
bungalow
which
was
tenanted
by
a
very
old
friend
and
distant
connexion
of
mine
he
was
an
officer
in
one
of
her
majesty
regiments
of
foot
then
stationed
at
umballah
you
will
sleep
here
of
course
during
your
stay
he
said
but
you
are
the
guest
of
the
mess
remember
we
have
settled
all
that
and
we
will
go
up
in
the
buggy
presently
to
deposit
your
pasteboard
in
the
mess
reading
room
i
will
point
out
to
you
where
you
will
always
find
your
knife
and
fork
and
i
will
introduce
to
you
all
the
servants
the
especially
i
must
now
digress
for
a
brief
while
in
order
to
give
the
uninitiated
reader
some
idea
of
indian
etiquette
as
it
exists
amongst
europeans
members
of
society
in
other
countries
or
at
all
events
in
england
when
a
gentleman
goes
to
take
up
his
abode
for
a
long
or
a
short
period
in
a
strange
locality
it
is
usual
for
the
residents
if
they
desire
to
show
him
any
civility
or
make
his
acquaintance
to
call
upon
him
in
the
first
instance
in
india
the
reverse
is
the
case
the
stranger
must
make
his
round
of
calls
if
he
wishes
to
know
the
residents
and
what
is
more
he
must
leave
his
cards
on
the
mess
for
the
colonel
and
officers
of
her
majesty
regiment
you
may
leave
a
card
on
every
officer
in
the
regiment
from
the
senior
colonel
down
to
the
junior
ensign
and
each
of
them
may
and
possibly
will
invite
you
to
his
private
board
but
if
you
omit
to
leave
a
card
on
the
mess
it
would
be
a
gross
breach
of
decorum
in
any
member
of
the
mess
to
invite
you
to
dine
at
the
because
you
have
not
left
a
card
on
the
mess
and
not
only
to
the
royal
regiments
does
the
rule
pertain
but
to
every
regiment
in
india
and
to
every
brigade
of
artillery
having
left
my
cards
at
the
mess
of
the
regiment
to
which
my
friend
belonged
i
was
driven
to
the
of
the
dragoons
where
another
expenditure
of
cards
was
incurred
then
to
the
of
the
two
native
infantry
regiments
and
the
of
the
native
cavalry
regiment
i
was
then
whisked
off
to
the
house
of
general
sir
doodle
dudley
who
commanded
the
division
the
general
was
very
old
close
upon
eighty
but
he
was
made
up
to
represent
a
gentleman
of
about
forty
his
chestnut
wig
fitted
him
to
perfection
and
his
whiskers
were
dyed
so
adroitly
that
they
were
an
exact
imitation
of
their
original
colour
the
white
teeth
were
all
false
likewise
the
pink
colour
in
the
cheeks
and
the
ivory
hue
of
the
forehead
as
for
the
general
dress
it
fitted
him
like
a
glove
and
his
patent
leather
boots
and
his
gold
spurs
were
the
neatest
and
prettiest
i
had
ever
seen
in
early
life
sir
doodle
had
been
a
rival
and
an
acquaintance
of
beau
brummell
when
a
colonel
in
the
peninsular
war
he
had
been
what
is
called
a
very
good
regimental
officer
but
from
until
his
appointment
to
india
in
as
a
general
of
division
he
had
been
unattached
and
had
never
done
a
single
day
duty
he
was
so
hopelessly
deaf
that
he
never
even
attempted
to
ask
what
was
said
to
him
but
a
stranger
as
i
was
would
scarcely
have
credited
it
for
the
general
talked
laughed
and
rattled
on
as
though
he
were
perfectly
unconscious
of
his
infirmity
i
ventured
a
casual
remark
touching
the
late
which
had
swept
over
the
district
to
which
the
general
very
vivaciously
replied
yes
my
good
sir
i
knew
her
in
the
zenith
of
her
beauty
and
influence
when
she
was
a
lady
patroness
of
almack
and
the
chief
favourite
of
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
oh
yes
she
is
dead
i
see
by
the
last
overland
paper
but
i
did
not
think
she
was
so
old
as
they
say
she
was
only
fancy
then
darting
off
at
a
tangent
he
remarked
i
see
they
give
it
out
that
i
am
to
have
the
at
bombay
the
fact
is
i
do
want
bombay
and
so
i
have
told
my
friends
at
the
horse
guards
at
least
a
dozen
times
i
want
the
governorship
and
the
at
the
cape
but
if
they
thrust
bombay
upon
me
i
suppose
i
must
take
it
one
ca
always
pick
and
choose
and
i
fancy
it
is
only
right
to
oblige
now
and
then
we
shall
be
very
sorry
to
lose
you
general
said
my
friend
mechanically
very
sorry
indeed
so
i
have
told
his
excellency
exclaimed
the
general
who
presumed
that
my
friend
was
now
talking
on
an
entirely
different
subject
so
i
have
told
him
but
he
will
not
listen
to
me
he
says
that
if
the
still
adheres
to
its
finding
of
murder
he
will
upset
the
whole
of
the
proceedings
and
order
the
man
to
return
to
his
duty
and
the
court
adhere
to
its
original
finding
for
the
court
says
and
i
say
that
a
private
who
deliberately
loads
his
firelock
and
deliberately
fires
at
and
wounds
a
serjeant
can
not
properly
be
convicted
of
manslaughter
only
well
it
can
not
be
helped
i
suppose
the
fact
is
the
is
now
too
old
for
his
work
and
he
is
as
he
always
was
very
obstinate
and
and
the
general
continued
for
the
command
of
an
army
or
a
division
in
india
we
want
men
who
are
not
above
listening
to
the
advice
of
the
experienced
officers
by
whom
they
are
surrounded
when
we
were
leaving
the
general
he
mistook
me
for
my
friend
and
my
friend
for
me
and
respectively
addressed
us
accordingly
his
eyesight
was
very
imperfect
and
he
was
too
vain
to
wear
glasses
he
thanked
me
for
having
brought
my
friend
to
call
upon
him
and
assured
my
friend
that
it
would
afford
him
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
if
the
acquaintance
that
day
made
should
ripen
into
friendship
he
is
an
imbecile
i
remarked
when
we
were
driving
away
from
the
general
door
yes
and
he
has
been
for
the
last
six
or
seven
years
was
the
reply
but
he
must
be
labouring
under
some
delusion
with
respect
to
being
appointed
to
the
of
an
indian
presidency
nothing
of
the
kind
he
is
certain
of
it
he
will
go
to
bombay
before
six
weeks
are
over
you
will
see
the
general
go
to
bombay
where
he
played
such
fantastic
tricks
before
high
heaven
that
the
angels
could
not
have
wept
for
laughing
at
them
amongst
other
things
he
insisted
on
the
officers
of
the
regiments
buttoning
their
coats
and
jackets
up
to
the
throat
during
the
hottest
time
of
the
year
he
would
have
nothing
unmilitary
he
said
hot
climate
or
no
hot
climate
he
was
quite
childish
before
he
relinquished
his
command
and
was
brought
home
just
in
time
to
die
in
his
fatherland
and
at
the
of
his
aristocratic
ancestors
although
utterly
unfitted
in
his
after
life
to
command
troops
he
was
a
very
polished
old
gentleman
externally
and
having
enjoyed
a
very
intimate
acquaintance
with
bl√ºcher
and
other
celebrated
commanders
he
could
repeat
many
anecdotes
of
them
worthy
of
remembrance
bl√ºcher
he
used
to
say
generally
turned
into
bed
all
standing
included
and
if
his
valet
forgot
to
take
off
his
spurs
and
they
became
entangled
with
the
sheets
woe
betide
the
valet
the
torrent
of
abuse
that
he
poured
forth
was
something
terrific
i
also
heard
the
general
say
that
bl√ºcher
having
seen
everything
in
london
remarked
with
great
earnestness
give
me
ludgate
hill
and
on
being
asked
to
explain
why
replied
with
reference
to
the
number
of
jewellers
and
silversmiths
shops
which
in
that
day
decorated
the
locality
mein
gott
what
pillage
after
leaving
the
general
house
we
called
upon
some
six
or
eight
other
magnates
of
umballah
for
the
time
being
and
on
returning
to
the
at
the
hour
of
tiffin
i
was
rather
fatigued
the
scene
however
revived
me
considerably
there
were
seated
round
the
large
table
in
the
centre
of
the
lonely
room
some
seventy
or
eighty
officers
of
all
ranks
from
the
various
regiments
in
the
station
there
was
to
be
a
meeting
held
that
day
at
the
to
discuss
some
local
matter
and
the
majority
of
those
present
had
been
invited
to
tiff
previously
no
one
was
in
uniform
at
least
not
in
military
uniform
all
wore
light
and
hats
covered
with
turbans
the
local
question
touching
the
best
means
of
watering
the
mall
where
the
residents
used
to
take
their
evening
ride
or
drive
having
been
discussed
the
party
broke
up
some
went
to
the
different
to
play
matches
for
money
of
course
others
retired
to
private
bungalows
to
play
cards
or
read
while
reclining
on
a
couch
or
a
bed
or
a
mat
upon
the
floor
every
one
smoked
and
sipped
some
sort
of
liquid
it
was
to
a
room
in
my
friend
bungalow
that
eleven
of
the
party
inclusive
of
myself
repaired
to
while
away
the
time
until
sundown
by
playing
whist
never
did
the
character
of
an
officer
life
in
india
strike
me
so
forcibly
as
on
that
afternoon
there
was
an
air
of
lassitude
and
satiety
about
every
one
present
the
day
was
hot
and
muggy
and
the
atmosphere
very
oppressive
it
was
a
fatiguing
bore
to
deal
the
cards
take
up
the
tricks
mark
the
game
or
raise
to
one
lips
the
claret
cup
which
sham
had
been
called
upon
to
brew
sham
was
well
known
to
most
of
the
officers
of
the
regiment
to
which
my
friend
belonged
he
had
made
their
acquaintance
to
use
his
own
words
when
he
was
on
the
staff
the
three
men
who
had
not
cut
in
at
whist
were
lounging
about
and
making
ineffectual
attempts
to
keep
up
a
conversation
the
and
the
waistcoats
were
now
discarded
and
the
suspenders
and
the
shoes
or
boots
in
short
each
person
only
wore
strictly
necessary
clothing
while
the
native
coolie
in
the
verandah
was
ever
and
anon
loudly
called
upon
to
pull
the
punkah
as
strongly
as
possible
that
room
that
afternoon
presented
a
perfect
picture
of
cantonment
life
in
india
during
the
summer
season
between
the
hours
of
two
and
five
the
body
is
too
much
exhausted
to
admit
of
any
serious
mental
exertion
beyond
that
which
sheer
amusement
can
afford
and
it
is
by
no
means
uncommon
to
find
your
partner
or
yourself
dropping
off
to
sleep
when
called
upon
to
lead
a
card
or
follow
suit
the
three
men
who
were
sitting
or
lying
out
soon
yielded
to
the
influence
of
the
punkah
closed
their
eyes
and
got
up
a
snore
each
holding
between
his
fingers
the
cheroot
he
had
been
smoking
ah
yes
it
is
very
bad
to
have
to
endure
the
frightful
heat
to
feel
one
blood
on
the
broil
even
under
a
punkah
and
with
doors
and
windows
closed
to
exclude
the
hot
air
of
the
open
day
but
what
must
it
be
for
the
men
the
privates
and
their
wives
and
children
they
have
no
punkahs
though
it
has
been
shown
that
they
might
have
them
at
a
trifling
cost
they
have
no
cold
water
much
less
iced
water
to
sip
though
they
might
have
it
if
the
authorities
had
the
good
sense
to
put
humanity
entirely
out
of
the
question
to
be
economical
of
that
invaluable
commodity
in
india
british
flesh
and
blood
they
the
men
of
the
ranks
and
their
wives
and
children
have
no
spacious
apartments
with
doors
and
windows
to
move
about
in
though
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
have
them
for
the
land
costs
nothing
and
labour
and
material
is
literally
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
but
the
royal
infantry
barracks
at
umballah
is
a
fine
large
building
it
may
be
suggested
i
reply
not
for
a
regiment
one
thousand
strong
a
regiment
mustering
one
thousand
bayonets
to
say
nothing
of
the
numerous
women
and
the
more
numerous
children
in
a
cold
climate
it
would
be
ample
for
their
accommodation
but
not
here
where
in
a
room
occupied
by
an
officer
the
thermometer
frequently
stands
at
degrees
and
sometimes
at
one
hundred
and
five
degrees
in
the
matter
of
ice
the
reader
must
be
informed
how
it
is
manufactured
during
the
cold
weather
as
the
winter
is
always
called
small
earthenware
vessels
of
shallow
build
resembling
saucers
in
shape
are
filled
with
water
and
placed
in
an
open
field
upon
a
low
bed
of
straw
at
dawn
of
day
there
is
a
coating
of
ice
upon
each
vessel
of
about
the
thickness
of
a
shilling
this
is
collected
by
men
women
and
children
natives
who
receive
for
each
morning
or
hour
work
a
sum
of
money
in
cowries
equal
to
about
half
of
a
farthing
when
collected
it
is
carried
to
an
and
there
stored
the
expenses
are
borne
by
a
subscription
and
the
amount
for
each
ticket
depends
entirely
on
the
number
of
subscribers
in
some
large
stations
an
for
the
hot
season
costs
only
three
pounds
in
smaller
stations
it
will
cost
six
pounds
the
amount
of
ice
received
by
each
is
about
four
pounds
and
is
brought
away
each
morning
at
daylight
in
a
canvas
bag
enveloped
in
a
thick
blanket
by
the
own
servant
it
is
then
deposited
in
a
basket
made
expressly
for
the
purpose
in
this
basket
is
placed
the
wine
beer
water
butter
and
fruit
the
bag
of
solid
ice
is
in
the
centre
of
all
these
and
imparts
to
each
an
equal
coldness
these
four
pounds
of
ice
if
properly
managed
and
the
air
kept
out
of
the
basket
will
cool
an
inconceivable
quantity
of
fluids
and
will
last
for
hours
that
is
to
say
there
will
be
some
ice
remaining
when
the
fresh
bag
is
brought
in
if
a
bewildered
khansamah
or
khitmutghur
in
his
haste
to
bring
a
bottle
leaves
the
basket
uncovered
the
inevitable
consequence
is
that
the
ice
melts
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
for
the
day
i
have
scarcely
known
a
family
in
which
corporal
punishment
was
not
inflicted
on
the
servant
guilty
of
such
a
piece
of
neglect
but
great
as
was
the
privation
it
was
always
cheerfully
endured
by
the
society
when
the
doctors
of
the
various
departments
indented
on
them
for
their
shares
of
ice
respectively
and
this
occasionally
happened
when
the
hospitals
were
crowded
with
cases
of
fever
scores
and
scores
of
lives
were
often
saved
by
the
application
of
ice
to
the
head
and
the
administration
of
cold
drinks
ice
is
not
manufactured
below
benares
calcutta
and
its
immediate
neighbourhood
revels
in
the
luxury
of
american
ice
which
may
be
purchased
for
three
per
seer
two
pounds
the
american
ships
trading
to
india
take
it
as
ballast
which
by
the
time
it
arrives
in
the
river
hooghley
becomes
a
solid
mass
the
sun
has
gone
down
and
it
is
now
time
to
bathe
and
dress
for
our
evening
drive
the
band
is
playing
we
descend
from
the
buggy
languidly
and
languidly
we
walk
first
to
one
carriage
and
then
to
another
to
talk
with
the
ladies
who
are
sitting
in
them
they
the
ladies
wear
a
very
languid
air
as
though
life
in
such
a
climate
were
a
great
burden
and
it
is
no
doubt
a
great
burden
from
the
middle
of
april
to
the
first
week
in
october
there
is
a
languid
air
even
about
the
liveliest
tunes
that
the
band
plays
then
we
languidly
drive
to
the
for
dinner
the
dinner
is
more
a
matter
of
form
than
anything
else
but
the
wines
which
are
well
iced
are
partaken
of
freely
enough
especially
the
champagne
there
is
of
course
no
intoxication
but
as
the
evening
advances
the
company
becomes
more
jovial
and
by
the
time
the
dessert
is
placed
on
the
table
that
dreadful
feeling
of
languor
has
in
a
great
measure
taken
its
departure
it
is
now
that
the
evening
commences
and
many
very
pleasant
evenings
have
been
spent
in
that
umballah
despite
the
heat
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
to
which
my
friend
belonged
was
a
man
of
very
good
sense
and
during
the
hot
season
he
sanctioned
his
officers
wearing
except
when
on
parade
a
white
twill
jacket
of
a
military
cut
with
the
regimental
button
and
he
had
not
the
slightest
objection
to
a
loose
necktie
instead
of
a
black
stock
this
matter
ought
to
have
been
sanctioned
by
the
highest
military
authority
the
or
rather
it
ought
to
have
been
stated
in
a
general
order
that
such
rational
attire
was
approved
of
instead
of
being
left
to
the
caprice
of
a
colonel
or
brigadier
or
general
of
division
the
regiment
of
royal
cavalry
too
were
equally
fortunate
in
their
colonel
he
was
also
of
opinion
that
the
comfort
of
the
officers
under
his
command
was
worthy
of
some
consideration
and
he
could
not
see
the
necessity
of
requiring
a
gentleman
to
sit
down
to
dinner
in
a
thick
red
cloth
jacket
padded
and
buttoned
up
to
the
very
chin
but
before
i
left
umballah
the
old
general
altered
this
and
insisted
on
this
loose
and
unsoldierlike
attire
being
instantly
abandoned
he
had
overlooked
it
for
several
months
or
at
all
events
had
expressed
no
objection
but
suddenly
the
commanding
was
aroused
to
observe
with
great
regret
that
the
dress
in
some
regiments
was
fast
becoming
subversive
the
reason
of
the
sudden
acuteness
of
observation
was
this
he
was
about
to
give
a
ball
at
his
own
house
and
for
some
inexplicable
cause
had
not
invited
any
of
the
officers
of
her
majesty
regiment
of
foot
but
on
the
morning
of
the
night
on
which
the
ball
was
to
take
place
he
requested
his
to
write
the
following
note
the
commanding
the
division
desires
that
the
band
of
foot
may
be
in
attendance
at
the
house
at
nine
precisely
and
the
band
went
at
nine
for
the
general
had
a
perfect
right
to
order
the
men
to
attend
at
his
house
whenever
he
pleased
but
the
band
went
without
their
musical
instruments
for
they
as
i
believe
is
the
case
in
all
regiments
were
the
private
property
of
the
officers
for
the
time
being
and
like
the
regimental
plate
the
loan
thereof
for
any
particular
occasion
must
be
regarded
as
a
matter
of
favour
and
not
as
a
matter
of
right
so
the
general
had
no
music
out
of
the
band
and
the
officers
in
the
station
had
no
comfort
in
their
dress
until
the
general
left
the
station
for
his
command
at
bombay
it
may
possibly
be
imagined
that
the
general
had
in
his
earlier
days
done
the
state
great
service
as
a
military
commander
and
for
that
his
appointment
was
the
reward
nothing
of
the
kind
when
he
left
the
army
and
became
unattached
he
was
only
a
regimental
colonel
and
had
only
been
once
mentioned
by
the
duke
of
wellington
in
his
despatches
as
having
gallantly
led
his
regiment
into
action
for
this
single
mention
he
was
made
a
brevet
and
a
while
other
colonels
who
had
performed
precisely
the
same
service
remained
unpromoted
and
undecorated
sometimes
during
his
indian
career
not
that
he
was
intoxicated
by
wine
for
the
general
in
his
dotage
was
rather
abstemious
he
would
be
utterly
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
he
in
india
and
would
hold
a
conversation
with
some
young
ensign
who
had
been
one
of
his
dinner
party
and
who
in
haste
to
get
away
early
to
billiards
came
up
to
say
good
night
after
the
following
fashion
look
here
my
pretty
boy
as
you
will
be
passing
fribourg
and
pontet
just
look
in
and
tell
them
o
how
like
you
are
to
your
dear
mother
i
can
remember
her
when
she
was
thought
and
truly
to
be
one
of
the
prettiest
women
in
all
europe
charming
eyes
lovely
complexion
well
look
in
at
fribourg
and
pontet
yes
general
and
tell
them
to
send
me
a
canister
of
the
duke
of
kent
mixture
o
how
very
like
you
are
to
your
dear
mother
my
pretty
boy
the
last
they
sent
me
had
scent
in
it
tell
them
i
hate
scent
in
snuff
yes
general
o
how
very
like
you
are
to
your
dear
mother
the
general
had
never
seen
the
boy
mother
in
the
course
of
his
long
and
useless
life
yes
general
well
do
not
forget
the
snuff
o
no
general
good
night
god
bless
thee
my
pretty
boy
o
how
like
you
are
to
your
dear
mother
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
general
sir
doodle
dudley
was
an
average
specimen
of
the
general
officers
sent
out
by
the
horse
guards
to
command
divisions
in
india
that
would
be
untrue
for
some
though
very
old
and
inefficient
could
see
hear
and
understand
but
within
the
past
ten
years
some
others
that
i
know
of
have
been
sent
out
to
bengal
alone
who
were
not
one
whit
more
efficient
than
general
sir
doodle
dudley
the
nights
being
more
enjoyable
comparatively
than
the
days
no
wonder
that
they
are
rarely
given
up
for
sleep
by
the
majority
of
military
men
or
younger
civilians
in
india
of
course
married
men
with
families
must
and
do
for
the
most
part
lead
regular
lives
or
at
all
events
conform
to
some
fixed
domestic
rules
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
unmarried
who
take
their
rest
sleep
much
in
the
same
way
that
inveterate
drunkards
take
their
drink
little
and
often
you
will
see
a
young
officer
playing
at
billiards
at
two
or
three
in
the
morning
and
at
five
you
will
see
him
on
the
with
his
company
he
has
had
his
sleep
and
his
bath
and
to
use
his
own
words
he
feels
as
fresh
as
a
between
seven
and
twelve
he
will
also
have
an
hour
or
so
of
the
balmy
and
then
after
tiffin
he
will
perhaps
get
a
few
winks
while
reading
the
newspaper
or
a
book
or
while
sitting
on
the
bench
in
the
watching
the
game
have
these
young
men
it
may
be
asked
nothing
to
do
have
they
no
occupation
yes
they
have
to
keep
themselves
alive
and
in
good
spirits
and
that
is
no
easy
task
either
in
the
hot
weather
of
the
upper
provinces
some
of
them
a
few
in
the
east
india
service
will
take
to
studying
the
languages
in
the
hope
that
proficiency
therein
will
lead
to
staff
employ
those
however
who
do
not
happen
to
have
good
interest
to
back
their
claims
soon
find
out
that
the
order
of
the
in
council
touching
a
knowledge
of
the
native
languages
is
a
mere
sham
and
that
ignorance
clothed
with
interest
is
so
far
as
advancement
in
life
is
concerned
far
preferable
to
a
head
and
a
steady
character
military
matters
a
court
martial
is
it
possible
exclaimed
my
friend
on
looking
into
the
general
order
book
which
was
put
before
him
on
the
well
i
did
not
think
it
would
come
to
that
i
did
said
the
major
of
the
regiment
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
for
it
strikes
me
that
the
chief
is
never
so
happy
as
when
he
is
squabbling
with
the
members
of
the
courts
and
publicly
reprimanding
them
for
their
inconsistency
or
whatever
else
may
occur
to
him
this
is
the
seventh
court
martial
held
in
this
station
within
the
past
two
months
and
with
the
exception
of
one
case
the
whole
of
them
were
unnecessary
i
was
tempted
to
ask
who
was
to
be
tried
two
boys
replied
the
major
who
thought
proper
to
quarrel
at
the
and
to
make
use
of
a
certain
little
word
not
altogether
becoming
gentlemen
if
applied
to
one
another
the
senior
captain
who
was
the
senior
officer
present
very
properly
put
them
under
arrest
and
sent
them
to
their
quarters
our
colonel
who
is
i
am
very
happy
to
say
extremely
particular
on
this
as
well
as
on
every
other
point
that
tends
to
preserve
the
tone
and
character
of
the
regiment
wished
these
lads
to
receive
from
a
higher
authority
than
himself
a
severe
reprimand
that
authority
was
the
general
of
the
division
and
if
the
general
of
the
division
had
been
sir
joseph
thackwell
an
officer
of
sound
judgment
or
any
commander
of
sir
joseph
stamp
all
would
have
been
well
but
the
colonel
who
has
since
found
out
the
mistake
that
he
made
in
not
weighing
the
individual
character
of
sir
doodle
forwarded
the
case
on
to
him
through
the
brigadier
in
the
regular
way
the
young
gentlemen
meanwhile
remaining
under
arrest
the
colonel
also
saw
sir
doodle
privately
and
pointed
out
to
him
so
far
as
he
could
make
himself
understood
that
a
severe
reprimand
was
all
that
was
required
sir
doodle
however
did
not
view
the
matter
in
this
light
and
forwarded
the
proceedings
to
the
at
simlah
after
a
fortnight
delay
during
which
time
those
two
boys
have
been
confined
to
their
respective
bungalows
the
order
has
come
down
for
a
general
court
martial
to
assemble
and
try
them
this
will
involve
a
further
imprisonment
of
some
three
or
four
weeks
for
the
chief
is
sure
to
find
fault
with
the
court
finding
and
send
back
the
proceedings
for
revision
and
reconsideration
previous
to
confirming
and
approving
of
them
and
what
do
you
suppose
will
be
the
upshot
i
asked
that
the
lads
will
be
released
or
ordered
to
return
to
their
duty
said
the
major
have
you
ever
witnessed
a
military
court
martial
no
then
i
would
advise
you
to
witness
this
on
the
following
day
a
frightfully
hot
day
the
thermometer
being
at
i
accompanied
my
friend
in
his
buggy
to
the
of
the
regiment
where
i
beheld
some
officers
in
full
dress
all
these
officers
were
in
some
way
or
other
connected
with
the
trial
besides
these
there
were
present
some
officers
in
red
or
blue
jackets
but
without
their
swords
these
were
spectators
it
was
altogether
a
very
imposing
scene
especially
when
the
thirteen
members
took
their
seats
around
the
table
the
president
in
the
centre
and
the
of
the
division
opposite
to
him
the
prisoners
standing
behind
the
chair
of
the
the
lads
were
now
perfectly
reconciled
to
each
other
and
as
good
friends
as
ever
indeed
on
the
morning
that
followed
their
use
of
the
one
very
objectionable
little
word
mutual
apologies
and
expressions
of
regret
passed
between
them
and
in
so
far
as
the
settling
of
the
quarrel
between
themselves
was
concerned
it
was
most
judiciously
and
satisfactorily
arranged
by
their
respective
friends
the
court
having
been
duly
sworn
and
the
charges
read
aloud
by
the
the
prisoners
were
called
upon
to
plead
both
of
them
wished
to
plead
guilty
and
said
so
in
a
low
tone
to
the
who
in
an
equally
low
tone
of
voice
said
no
do
do
that
say
guilty
but
look
here
my
dear
fellow
said
one
of
the
prisoners
to
that
functionary
who
was
the
prosecutor
on
the
occasion
what
the
use
of
denying
it
we
did
make
two
fools
of
ourselves
yes
what
the
use
of
wasting
time
said
the
other
prisoner
if
we
plead
guilty
there
an
end
of
it
and
the
court
can
sentence
us
at
once
and
send
the
papers
up
to
simlah
by
post
i
am
sick
of
that
cursed
bungalow
of
mine
and
want
to
have
a
change
of
air
well
do
as
you
like
said
the
but
my
advice
is
that
you
plead
guilty
and
then
in
your
defence
you
can
put
forth
whatever
you
please
in
extenuation
and
mitigation
of
the
punishment
but
here
we
are
brought
up
for
calling
each
other
liars
in
a
moment
of
passion
and
if
we
say
we
did
not
call
each
other
liars
we
liars
and
what
is
more
we
are
liars
in
cold
blood
urged
one
of
the
prisoners
will
you
admit
that
you
were
drunk
said
the
no
they
both
called
out
we
were
not
strictly
sober
perhaps
but
where
is
it
about
being
drunk
we
did
see
that
in
the
charge
yes
here
it
is
in
the
second
instance
of
the
second
charge
while
in
a
state
of
intoxication
at
the
of
her
majesty
regiment
of
foot
on
the
night
oh
that
an
infamous
falsehood
you
know
who
said
that
not
captain
stansfield
who
put
us
under
arrest
if
he
swears
that
he
shall
answer
for
it
intoxicated
not
a
bit
of
it
screwed
nothing
more
cried
the
young
officer
in
a
sort
of
stage
whisper
on
my
honour
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
nothing
more
these
charges
have
come
down
from
having
been
prepared
in
the
office
of
the
who
is
he
what
his
name
asked
the
prisoners
colonel
birch
was
the
reply
then
he
shall
give
up
his
authority
well
plead
not
guilty
and
you
will
have
it
very
well
then
off
she
goes
guilty
fifty
not
guilties
if
you
like
on
that
point
while
this
little
but
interesting
debate
was
pending
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
prisoners
the
various
members
of
the
court
were
holding
with
each
other
a
miscellaneous
conversation
or
otherwise
amusing
themselves
colonel
jackstone
of
the
native
infantry
who
was
the
president
of
the
court
martial
in
virtue
of
the
seniority
of
his
rank
was
talking
to
colonel
colverly
of
the
dragoons
about
some
extraordinary
ailment
of
his
wife
which
required
the
constant
administration
of
brandy
and
in
order
to
keep
her
alive
it
was
a
low
sinking
fever
he
said
from
which
she
had
suffered
for
the
last
six
or
seven
years
at
intervals
of
three
months
and
it
was
always
worse
in
the
hot
weather
than
at
any
other
season
of
the
year
captain
bulstrade
of
the
artillery
was
talking
to
major
wallchaffe
of
the
light
bengal
cavalry
concerning
a
which
he
had
that
morning
invented
a
or
bottle
half
filled
with
soapsuds
and
the
opening
besmeared
with
honey
or
moistened
sugar
captain
dundriffe
was
recommending
captain
nolens
to
buy
some
beer
which
a
native
merchant
had
recently
imported
into
the
station
lieutenant
blade
of
the
dragoons
was
playing
at
odd
and
even
with
his
fingers
on
honour
with
lieutenant
theston
of
the
same
regiment
and
with
a
pretence
of
being
ready
to
take
notes
of
the
proceedings
of
the
court
martial
each
pen
in
right
hand
was
keeping
an
account
of
the
score
blade
used
to
boast
of
being
the
inventor
of
this
simple
game
but
there
were
officers
in
india
who
declared
that
it
owed
its
existence
to
a
late
of
the
forces
and
who
invented
it
at
school
when
he
had
been
shut
up
in
a
dark
room
with
another
boy
as
fond
of
gambling
as
himself
as
a
punishment
for
card
playing
and
other
games
of
chance
requiring
light
to
see
what
was
going
on
nothing
could
possibly
be
simpler
than
the
game
and
played
as
it
was
on
honour
nothing
could
be
fairer
blade
lost
thirty
pounds
on
the
first
day
of
the
court
martial
but
won
the
greater
part
of
it
back
on
the
day
following
of
course
it
would
not
do
to
play
at
this
game
with
strangers
or
promiscuous
acquaintances
lieutenant
belterton
of
the
regiment
was
making
use
of
the
pens
ink
and
paper
by
sketching
the
president
and
several
others
who
had
somewhat
prominent
noses
and
young
lofter
was
trying
to
rival
him
in
this
amusement
my
own
friend
was
very
busy
writing
and
from
the
serious
expression
on
his
countenance
you
might
have
fancied
he
was
composing
a
sermon
or
writing
a
letter
of
advice
to
a
refractory
son
he
folded
up
the
paper
and
passed
it
round
till
at
last
it
reached
me
i
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
we
shall
be
here
till
four
take
the
buggy
and
drive
up
to
the
bungalow
and
tell
the
khitmutghur
to
bring
down
the
also
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
from
our
mess
for
they
are
rather
short
here
and
ca
stand
a
heavy
run
upon
them
tell
him
also
to
bring
several
bottles
of
our
madeira
for
theirs
i
do
not
like
and
wo
drink
it
has
not
age
and
has
not
travelled
sufficiently
cigars
also
i
am
literally
bathed
in
perspiration
and
so
i
fancy
are
most
of
us
at
this
end
of
the
table
for
the
punkah
is
too
far
distant
to
admit
of
our
receiving
any
benefit
therefrom
this
is
an
awful
business
in
compliance
with
the
request
contained
in
the
above
note
i
left
the
court
drove
off
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
communicated
my
wishes
to
his
servant
who
immediately
hastened
to
fulfil
them
by
the
time
i
returned
to
the
court
the
first
witness
was
under
examination
such
a
waste
of
time
such
a
trial
to
the
temper
of
all
present
instead
of
allowing
the
senior
captain
to
state
the
facts
and
he
would
have
done
so
in
less
than
three
minutes
and
then
take
them
down
on
paper
each
question
was
written
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
submitted
to
the
president
by
the
who
showed
it
to
the
officers
sitting
on
either
side
of
him
who
nodded
assent
the
question
was
then
read
aloud
to
the
witness
were
you
present
on
the
night
of
the
of
april
at
the
of
her
majesty
regiment
of
foot
the
captain
replied
i
was
the
question
and
answer
were
then
copied
into
the
book
and
the
slip
of
paper
on
which
the
question
was
originally
written
was
torn
up
this
occupied
for
the
was
not
a
rapid
writer
and
was
apparently
in
no
particular
hurry
being
a
man
of
very
equable
temperament
eight
minutes
the
second
question
was
put
in
precisely
the
same
way
the
same
ceremonies
having
been
gone
through
the
second
question
was
were
the
prisoners
present
on
that
occasion
they
were
replied
the
captain
again
the
copying
process
went
on
slowly
and
methodically
and
blade
who
was
still
playing
odd
and
even
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
to
make
it
appear
that
he
was
giving
up
his
mind
entirely
to
the
investigation
what
was
the
answer
i
did
not
hear
it
distinctly
be
so
good
as
to
request
the
witness
to
speak
up
he
said
were
returned
the
oh
were
repeated
blade
writing
down
a
mark
signifying
that
he
had
just
lost
four
rupees
twenty
minutes
had
now
elapsed
and
the
above
was
all
that
had
been
elicited
from
the
first
witness
who
was
seemingly
as
impatient
as
most
of
the
members
of
the
court
the
however
had
patience
enough
for
all
present
and
so
had
blade
and
his
adversary
at
odd
and
even
my
friend
having
scowled
at
blade
for
putting
his
question
and
thus
prolonging
the
inquiry
that
aggravating
officer
now
periodically
spoke
to
the
who
invariably
put
down
his
pen
to
answer
him
just
as
if
he
could
not
possibly
speak
with
that
instrument
in
his
hand
it
was
a
two
when
the
examination
in
chief
was
concluded
it
began
at
twelve
precisely
so
that
two
hours
and
fifteen
minutes
had
been
consumed
in
taking
down
the
following
and
no
more
i
was
present
on
the
night
in
question
and
placed
the
prisoners
under
an
arrest
for
giving
each
other
the
lie
in
an
offensive
and
ungentlemanlike
manner
they
were
excited
seemingly
by
the
wine
they
had
taken
but
i
can
not
say
that
they
were
drunk
the
court
then
adjourned
for
to
the
to
take
some
refreshment
every
one
dripping
drenched
then
came
the
opening
the
fronts
of
the
thick
red
cloth
coats
and
the
imbibing
of
brandy
and
iced
beer
and
other
fluids
and
sundry
violent
exclamations
that
it
was
worse
than
the
battle
of
sobraon
more
trying
to
the
constitution
every
one
then
sat
down
to
tiffin
and
having
hastily
devoured
a
few
morsels
smoked
cheroots
i
say
blade
said
the
senior
captain
what
did
you
mean
by
wishing
me
to
speak
up
surely
you
heard
my
answer
mean
my
dear
fellow
i
meant
nothing
or
if
i
did
it
was
only
to
take
a
mild
rise
out
of
you
however
do
interrupt
me
just
now
for
i
am
thinking
over
a
lot
of
questions
i
intend
to
put
to
you
when
we
get
back
into
court
questions
about
what
about
drink
that
all
i
will
tell
you
now
you
do
suppose
that
i
was
born
the
son
of
a
judge
of
the
queen
bench
for
nothing
do
you
if
so
you
are
vastly
mistaken
is
that
your
madeira
or
ours
ours
then
just
spill
some
into
this
glass
ours
is
not
good
certainly
but
it
would
not
do
to
say
so
before
the
colonel
ah
sighed
the
lieutenant
after
taking
a
draught
that
is
excellent
yes
drink
is
the
topic
on
which
i
intend
to
walk
into
you
practically
and
be
very
careful
how
you
answer
or
you
will
have
the
down
upon
you
with
notes
of
admiration
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
of
his
general
order
notes
of
interrogation
in
the
same
and
every
other
word
in
italics
or
capitals
in
order
to
impress
the
matter
of
his
decision
firmly
on
our
minds
the
court
raving
mad
witness
ought
to
be
tried
folly
imbecility
childishness
the
veriest
schoolboy
ought
to
know
better
ignorant
of
his
duty
the
president
insane
confirmed
but
not
approved
what
are
you
making
such
a
noise
about
blade
inquired
the
colonel
of
his
regiment
nothing
colonel
said
blade
no
noise
but
here
is
a
man
who
has
the
audacity
in
our
own
to
asperse
the
character
of
our
madeira
and
taking
up
the
senior
captain
own
bottle
and
holding
it
before
the
senior
captain
face
he
exclaimed
looking
at
the
colonel
he
positively
refuses
to
taste
it
even
nonsense
said
the
cavalry
colonel
approaching
them
with
a
serious
air
and
with
an
empty
glass
in
his
hand
nonsense
do
you
really
mean
to
say
that
our
madeira
is
not
good
excellent
no
colonel
said
the
senior
captain
of
the
royal
infantry
regiment
taste
it
and
say
what
you
think
of
it
colonel
said
blade
filling
the
colonel
glass
which
was
held
up
to
receive
the
liquid
with
a
willingness
which
imparted
some
mirth
to
the
beholders
taste
it
there
i
have
tasted
it
said
the
colonel
and
pronounce
it
to
be
the
best
i
ever
drank
in
my
life
and
in
my
judgment
infinitely
superior
to
that
of
any
other
mess
so
i
say
said
blade
filling
his
glass
but
the
misfortune
is
he
wo
believe
me
order
a
fresh
bottle
of
our
wine
for
him
blade
said
the
colonel
and
let
him
taste
the
top
of
it
no
thank
you
colonel
said
the
senior
captain
i
would
rather
not
remember
i
have
to
conclude
my
examination
ah
so
you
have
said
the
colonel
moving
away
but
take
my
word
for
it
that
better
madeira
than
ours
was
never
grown
or
bottled
when
the
court
resumed
its
sitting
i
observed
that
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
became
drowsy
and
dropped
off
to
sleep
opening
one
eye
occasionally
for
a
second
or
two
others
became
fidgety
impetuous
and
argumentative
the
president
inquired
if
the
members
of
the
court
would
like
to
ask
the
witness
any
questions
several
responded
in
the
affirmative
and
began
to
write
their
questions
on
slips
of
paper
blade
however
was
the
first
to
throw
his
slip
across
the
table
to
the
who
having
read
it
handed
it
across
to
the
president
who
showed
it
to
the
officers
on
either
side
of
him
who
nodded
assent
the
question
was
then
handed
back
to
the
who
proceeded
to
read
it
aloud
you
have
stated
that
the
prisoners
were
under
the
influence
of
wine
but
that
they
were
not
drunk
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
the
senior
captain
that
they
not
so
quick
please
said
the
you
mean
that
yes
i
am
quite
ready
i
mean
said
the
witness
that
though
they
had
both
been
partaking
freely
of
wine
they
were
not
freely
of
wine
do
be
in
a
hurry
said
the
repeating
each
word
that
he
took
down
mind
he
says
said
blade
of
wine
the
word
is
important
very
important
have
you
got
down
the
word
freely
yes
said
the
having
put
down
his
pen
to
ascertain
the
fact
and
make
it
known
to
his
interrogator
very
well
said
blade
then
put
the
rest
of
the
answer
down
at
your
earliest
convenience
i
am
in
no
particular
hurry
well
said
the
to
the
witness
they
were
not
not
what
not
drunk
said
the
witness
there
is
nothing
about
drunkenness
in
the
charges
said
the
president
where
are
the
charges
here
sir
said
the
but
please
let
me
write
down
your
remark
before
we
go
any
further
what
remark
inquired
the
president
that
there
is
nothing
about
drunkenness
in
the
charges
according
to
the
last
general
order
by
his
excellency
the
on
the
last
court
martial
held
in
this
station
everything
that
transpires
should
be
recorded
and
the
then
resumed
his
writing
in
the
slowest
and
most
provoking
manner
imaginable
several
of
the
audience
walked
out
of
the
court
and
went
into
the
room
where
the
refreshments
were
i
followed
them
we
remained
absent
for
more
than
ten
minutes
but
when
we
came
back
the
had
not
yet
written
up
to
the
desired
point
previous
to
going
on
with
blade
question
this
at
length
accomplished
he
looked
at
the
president
and
said
yes
sir
there
is
nothing
about
drunkenness
and
the
prisoners
are
not
charged
with
it
said
the
president
the
words
in
a
state
of
intoxication
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
surplusage
there
i
differ
with
you
sir
said
the
so
do
i
said
blade
clear
the
court
cried
the
president
whereupon
the
audience
the
prisoners
the
witnesses
in
fact
all
save
the
members
of
the
court
and
the
withdrew
whilst
a
discussion
which
lasted
for
of
an
hour
was
carried
on
every
member
giving
his
opinion
and
most
of
them
speaking
at
the
same
time
when
we
returned
to
the
court
after
of
an
hour
absence
the
senior
captain
resumed
his
seat
near
the
we
were
not
informed
of
what
had
taken
place
a
pause
of
several
minutes
ensued
when
blade
threw
across
the
table
another
little
slip
on
which
was
written
a
long
sentence
the
handed
it
to
the
president
who
on
reading
it
looked
a
good
deal
astonished
and
shook
his
head
whereupon
blade
who
was
evidently
bent
on
mischief
called
out
we
are
all
of
that
opinion
at
this
end
of
the
table
the
president
then
handed
blade
written
question
to
the
officer
who
sat
next
to
him
on
his
right
and
that
officer
passed
it
on
to
the
next
the
next
to
the
next
and
so
on
till
it
had
been
seen
by
every
member
of
the
court
some
signified
by
a
nod
some
by
a
shake
of
the
head
others
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
what
they
thought
about
it
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
a
difference
of
opinion
the
court
was
again
cleared
in
order
that
the
vote
for
or
against
might
be
taken
so
once
more
we
were
driven
into
the
to
refresh
ourselves
and
laugh
over
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
proceeding
after
waiting
there
for
about
minutes
the
adjutant
announced
in
a
loud
voice
the
court
is
open
and
we
returned
to
hear
the
president
say
that
as
it
was
now
nearly
four
the
court
must
be
adjourned
another
absurdity
in
connexion
with
courts
martial
after
four
the
court
must
not
sit
even
if
twenty
minutes
in
excess
of
that
hour
would
end
the
proceedings
and
render
another
meeting
unnecessary
the
then
locked
up
his
papers
in
a
box
placed
it
under
his
arm
bowed
to
the
court
walked
off
called
for
his
buggy
and
drove
home
the
members
of
the
court
the
prisoners
and
the
audience
then
dispersed
and
retired
to
their
respective
bungalows
all
very
tired
and
very
glad
of
some
repose
my
friend
on
taking
off
his
coat
asked
me
to
feel
the
weight
of
it
out
of
curiosity
saturated
as
it
was
it
must
including
the
epaulettes
have
weighed
some
pounds
the
next
day
at
eleven
the
court
again
met
the
first
thing
that
was
done
was
to
read
the
proceedings
of
the
previous
day
this
duty
was
performed
by
the
and
slowly
as
he
read
it
was
over
in
twelve
minutes
for
i
timed
him
that
is
to
say
it
had
taken
four
hours
and
a
half
to
get
through
the
real
business
of
twelve
minutes
or
giving
a
very
liberal
margin
the
business
of
and
now
another
very
curious
feature
of
an
indian
court
martial
presented
itself
the
president
asked
the
if
he
had
furnished
the
prisoners
with
a
copy
of
the
past
proceedings
the
said
no
the
prisoners
had
not
asked
for
a
copy
the
president
said
that
does
not
signify
did
you
tender
them
a
copy
no
sir
then
you
ought
to
have
done
so
the
prisoners
here
said
that
they
did
not
want
a
copy
the
president
answer
to
this
innocent
remark
was
that
whatever
they
had
to
say
they
must
reserve
till
they
were
called
upon
for
their
defence
desirous
of
not
provoking
the
animosity
of
the
president
they
bowed
and
very
respectfully
thanked
him
for
the
suggestion
whereupon
the
president
who
was
a
terrible
talker
and
passionately
fond
of
allusions
to
his
own
career
in
the
army
mentioned
a
case
within
his
own
personal
knowledge
it
was
a
case
that
happened
in
canada
and
he
had
reason
he
said
to
remember
it
because
he
was
at
the
time
on
the
staff
of
that
distinguished
officer
sir
james
kemp
and
heard
sir
james
remark
upon
it
the
honourable
ernest
augustus
fitzblossom
a
younger
son
of
the
earl
of
millflower
was
tried
for
cheating
at
cards
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
be
cashiered
this
sentence
was
confirmed
and
approved
by
the
general
and
the
honourable
lieutenant
went
home
an
appeal
was
made
to
the
horse
guards
and
it
came
out
that
no
copy
of
each
day
proceedings
had
been
tendered
to
the
prisoner
and
upon
that
ground
the
whole
of
the
proceedings
were
declared
by
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
york
to
be
null
and
void
he
the
president
did
not
mean
to
offer
any
opinion
on
that
case
but
he
merely
quoted
it
and
being
on
sir
james
staff
at
the
time
he
had
reason
to
remember
in
order
to
show
that
such
was
the
rule
a
captain
in
the
bengal
cavalry
said
he
knew
of
a
case
which
occurred
in
this
country
india
where
the
very
reverse
was
held
the
prisoner
a
lieutenant
burkett
of
the
bengal
native
infantry
was
tried
for
being
drunk
whilst
on
outpost
duty
the
trial
lasted
for
seventeen
days
for
no
less
than
witnesses
principally
natives
were
examined
the
lieutenant
at
the
close
of
the
case
for
the
prosecution
demanded
a
copy
of
the
proceedings
in
order
to
assist
him
in
drawing
up
his
defence
his
demand
was
not
complied
with
he
was
convicted
and
dismissed
the
service
he
appealed
to
the
who
ruled
that
a
prisoner
had
no
right
whatever
to
a
copy
of
the
proceedings
until
after
his
conviction
and
therefore
he
confirmed
and
approved
the
sentence
or
rather
as
he
had
done
that
already
he
rejected
the
appeal
did
he
appeal
to
the
horse
guards
asked
the
president
no
he
belonged
to
the
company
service
well
did
he
appeal
to
the
directors
they
might
have
restored
him
they
have
just
restored
a
man
bagin
who
was
cashiered
two
years
ago
for
gross
fraud
and
falsehood
in
several
instances
yes
i
know
bagin
was
in
my
regiment
but
bagin
has
an
uncle
in
the
direction
besides
a
stepfather
who
would
have
had
to
support
him
and
his
family
if
his
commission
had
not
been
restored
to
him
burkett
had
no
friends
and
very
lucky
for
him
how
do
you
mean
he
entered
the
service
of
a
native
prince
and
being
a
steady
fellow
and
a
clever
fellow
he
made
a
fortune
in
the
course
of
nine
years
and
is
now
living
at
home
on
his
fifteen
hundred
a
year
i
know
of
another
case
said
another
member
of
the
court
and
he
proceeded
to
detail
the
particulars
when
he
had
finished
another
member
told
of
another
case
and
so
this
desultory
narration
of
individual
experiences
went
on
for
one
hour
and
a
half
the
with
his
tongue
protruding
writing
away
as
methodically
as
possible
what
he
was
writing
i
do
not
know
but
i
fancy
he
was
taking
down
the
heads
of
the
various
cases
that
were
quoted
in
order
that
his
excellency
the
might
have
the
satisfaction
of
examining
them
i
was
told
afterwards
that
we
the
audience
and
the
prisoners
ought
not
to
have
been
allowed
to
remain
in
court
during
this
narration
of
cases
and
the
anecdotes
which
the
narrators
wove
into
them
but
i
need
scarcely
say
i
was
very
glad
that
our
presence
had
been
overlooked
for
if
i
had
not
seen
and
heard
what
took
place
i
should
not
certainly
have
believed
and
therefore
should
not
have
dreamt
of
describing
it
it
was
during
this
conversation
that
blade
won
back
from
his
adversary
at
odd
and
even
the
greater
portion
of
the
money
he
had
lost
on
the
previous
day
nor
that
either
blade
or
his
adversary
failed
to
take
a
part
in
the
conversation
for
both
of
them
would
now
and
then
ejaculate
what
an
extraordinary
case
did
you
ever
no
never
it
seems
impossible
cashiered
him
shameful
who
could
have
been
the
chairman
of
the
court
of
directors
a
dissenter
i
be
bound
well
sir
said
the
to
the
president
when
he
had
finished
his
writing
what
shall
we
do
shall
we
adjourn
the
court
until
a
copy
of
yesterday
proceedings
is
made
and
given
to
the
prisoners
no
doubt
said
the
president
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
the
error
can
be
repaired
but
a
copy
must
be
delivered
to
each
of
them
but
had
we
better
not
take
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
the
subject
suggested
the
by
all
means
conceded
the
president
but
in
that
case
the
court
must
be
cleared
while
the
votes
are
taken
clear
the
court
cried
the
adjutant
and
out
we
all
marched
again
into
the
where
more
cheroots
were
smoked
and
more
weak
imbibed
the
third
day
came
and
the
court
the
read
over
the
entire
proceedings
beginning
from
the
very
beginning
the
swearing
of
the
members
up
to
the
adjournment
of
the
court
and
the
reasons
for
such
adjournment
here
another
discussion
or
conversation
ensued
as
to
whether
it
was
necessary
to
read
more
than
the
last
day
proceedings
the
said
he
was
quite
right
the
president
thought
otherwise
all
the
other
members
of
the
court
spoke
on
the
subject
many
of
them
at
the
same
time
blade
and
his
adversary
also
gave
their
opinions
the
former
for
and
the
latter
opposed
to
the
view
taken
by
the
president
as
this
was
a
point
that
must
be
cleared
up
insomuch
as
the
decision
that
might
be
come
to
would
regulate
the
future
proceedings
in
this
respect
the
court
was
again
cleared
and
we
again
marched
into
the
room
where
the
refreshments
were
to
be
had
in
time
we
were
but
it
was
not
until
the
following
day
for
members
are
not
allowed
in
short
they
are
bound
by
oath
not
to
divulge
what
may
be
decided
when
the
doors
are
closed
that
we
learnt
the
had
carried
his
point
and
that
a
sort
of
parody
of
that
old
nursery
story
about
the
fire
began
to
burn
the
stick
the
stick
began
to
beat
the
dog
the
dog
began
to
bite
the
pig
was
the
proper
way
to
open
the
proceedings
of
each
day
during
a
protracted
trial
by
general
so
curiously
is
human
nature
constituted
that
i
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
audience
began
after
the
fifth
day
to
like
the
business
and
to
watch
its
various
twistings
and
turnings
with
great
interest
the
at
which
the
court
was
held
became
a
favourite
lounge
for
almost
everybody
in
the
station
and
it
was
curious
to
hear
the
bets
that
were
made
with
reference
to
the
probable
finding
and
the
sentence
the
trial
lasted
over
thirteen
days
inclusive
of
two
sundays
which
intervened
and
the
proceedings
were
then
forwarded
to
simlah
where
they
remained
for
a
fortnight
awaiting
the
decision
of
the
who
in
fulfilment
of
blade
prophecy
certainly
did
put
forth
a
snorter
of
a
general
order
and
as
full
as
it
could
be
of
italics
capitals
and
notes
of
exclamation
and
interrogation
his
excellency
walked
into
the
president
and
recommended
him
to
study
some
catechism
of
the
law
of
courts
martial
such
a
book
as
children
might
understand
his
excellency
further
remarked
that
the
senior
captain
the
principal
witness
or
any
man
wearing
a
sword
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
admitting
that
he
was
unable
to
define
the
various
stages
of
intoxication
and
that
he
was
astounded
to
find
that
the
court
in
general
should
have
paid
so
little
attention
to
the
admirable
reasoning
on
this
point
of
a
junior
member
whose
intelligence
appeared
to
have
enlisted
no
sympathy
this
had
reference
to
blade
his
excellency
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
never
himself
been
drunk
in
the
whole
course
of
his
long
life
and
to
that
fact
he
attributed
his
position
that
if
the
court
had
done
its
duty
it
would
have
cashiered
the
prisoners
that
a
severe
reprimand
which
the
court
awarded
was
a
mockery
which
stunk
in
the
nostrils
and
that
the
prisoners
were
to
be
released
from
arrest
and
return
to
their
duty
without
receiving
it
but
the
chief
did
not
end
here
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
would
maintain
the
discipline
of
the
british
army
in
the
east
in
all
ranks
or
else
he
would
know
the
reason
why
and
being
i
fancy
in
some
difficulty
as
to
what
to
use
in
the
case
whether
marks
of
admiration
or
interrogation
he
emphasized
the
last
word
of
this
culminating
and
very
relevant
sentence
thus
why
it
was
a
matter
of
grave
doubt
whether
the
determination
thus
expressed
to
uphold
discipline
in
the
army
was
in
any
way
assisted
by
such
general
orders
as
those
fired
off
from
the
pen
of
the
ardent
the
more
especially
as
such
general
orders
were
copied
into
the
newspapers
and
were
read
by
or
listened
to
while
others
were
reading
aloud
every
officer
and
private
in
upper
india
native
and
european
three
weeks
after
the
promulgation
of
the
general
order
just
alluded
to
a
trooper
in
the
dragoons
having
been
talked
to
seriously
by
the
captain
of
the
troop
for
some
irregular
conduct
thus
unburthened
himself
you
what
do
i
care
for
what
you
say
you
are
one
of
those
infernal
fools
whom
the
pitched
into
the
other
day
for
being
a
fool
and
as
the
peroration
of
this
speech
consisted
of
the
dashing
off
of
the
speaker
cap
and
hurling
it
into
the
captain
face
the
man
was
tried
convicted
and
sentenced
to
be
transported
for
life
if
it
be
inquired
by
the
reader
whether
the
above
description
of
a
court
martial
in
india
is
a
fair
specimen
of
what
usually
transpires
at
these
tribunals
i
reply
emphatically
yes
and
i
make
the
assertion
after
having
watched
the
proceedings
of
no
fewer
than
eighteen
courts
martial
during
my
sojourn
in
the
east
indies
four
officers
who
had
obtained
six
months
leave
of
absence
and
who
had
rented
between
them
a
furnished
house
at
simlah
were
about
to
proceed
there
i
was
tempted
to
accompany
them
we
left
umballah
at
sunset
in
palkees
and
at
seven
on
the
following
morning
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
at
a
place
called
kalka
where
there
is
an
hotel
having
breakfasted
we
commenced
the
ascent
on
ponyback
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
half
arrived
at
kussowlie
where
a
regiment
of
her
majesty
foot
was
quartered
here
we
rested
for
a
brief
while
and
then
pursued
our
journey
strange
to
say
although
the
climate
is
superb
and
the
scenery
grand
beyond
description
the
men
so
i
was
told
preferred
the
plains
regarding
them
to
use
their
own
words
less
like
a
prison
than
the
hills
from
kussowlie
we
pushed
on
to
sir√©e
which
is
about
half
way
between
simlah
and
kalka
here
there
is
a
bungalow
at
which
we
dined
on
the
everlasting
grilled
fowl
eggs
and
unleavened
bread
some
friends
at
simlah
who
had
been
written
to
previously
had
sent
five
horses
to
meet
us
so
that
when
we
resumed
our
journey
we
were
mounted
on
fresh
cattle
all
along
the
road
the
scenery
is
extremely
picturesque
and
beautiful
but
in
point
of
grandeur
it
does
not
in
my
opinion
equal
that
of
the
alps
it
was
nearly
dark
when
we
arrived
at
our
destination
and
entered
the
house
where
we
found
everything
ready
for
our
reception
the
servants
had
been
sent
on
a
day
or
two
in
advance
of
us
it
is
a
long
and
fatiguing
ride
forty
miles
in
the
sun
albeit
there
is
generally
a
light
breeze
to
modify
the
heat
and
we
were
all
disposed
to
retire
to
rest
but
we
were
unable
to
do
so
the
gentlemen
who
had
sent
the
horses
to
meet
us
as
soon
as
they
were
informed
of
our
arrival
came
to
see
us
and
what
was
more
to
take
us
to
a
subscription
ball
which
was
to
take
place
that
night
at
the
assembly
rooms
it
was
useless
to
plead
weariness
we
were
compelled
to
go
the
society
of
simlah
though
composed
of
the
same
elements
differs
very
much
from
the
society
of
mussoorie
the
presence
of
the
or
the
and
sometimes
both
as
was
the
case
when
i
was
at
simlah
imposes
a
restraint
on
the
visitors
to
this
sanitarium
the
younger
men
are
less
disposed
to
run
riot
and
incur
the
risk
of
having
their
leave
cancelled
and
themselves
sent
down
to
the
plains
a
ball
therefore
at
simlah
differs
from
a
ball
at
mussoorie
it
is
so
much
more
sedate
more
than
one
half
of
those
who
prefer
simlah
to
mussoorie
do
so
in
the
hope
of
prepossessing
one
or
other
of
the
great
authorities
by
being
brought
into
contact
with
them
and
thus
obtain
staff
employ
or
promotion
and
very
amusing
is
it
to
look
on
at
a
public
entertainment
and
witness
the
feelings
of
jealousy
and
of
envy
that
swell
the
breasts
of
the
various
candidates
for
notice
and
favour
nor
are
the
little
artifices
that
are
resorted
to
unworthy
of
observation
and
a
smile
at
this
ball
there
was
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
civilian
a
sad
fool
who
had
a
great
facility
in
taking
likenesses
and
she
had
drawn
the
in
every
possible
attitude
both
on
foot
and
on
horseback
these
clever
and
sketches
were
laid
upon
a
table
in
the
and
excited
very
general
admiration
and
it
was
very
soon
buzzed
about
who
was
the
artist
the
wife
of
another
civilian
however
maliciously
neutralized
the
effect
these
sketches
would
probably
have
had
by
falsely
saying
loud
enough
for
his
lordship
to
hear
ah
she
said
she
would
do
the
trick
with
her
pencil
the
consequence
was
that
when
the
lady
husband
begged
his
lordship
would
accept
this
collection
of
portraits
as
well
as
a
few
sketches
of
the
house
inhabited
by
the
great
man
his
lordship
as
delicately
and
as
gracefully
as
the
circumstances
would
admit
of
declined
them
with
many
thanks
just
as
though
they
had
been
so
many
unsuitable
contributions
to
some
popular
periodical
the
wife
of
a
military
officer
however
was
rather
more
fortunate
she
too
had
a
great
talent
for
drawing
and
had
taken
an
excellent
likeness
in
water
colours
of
the
favourite
charger
the
charger
that
had
carried
the
old
chief
through
his
battles
and
as
the
lady
begged
that
the
chief
would
accept
the
picture
he
did
so
and
the
next
made
known
that
captain
cloughcough
was
a
major
of
brigade
by
the
way
this
was
an
excellent
appointment
for
the
office
required
no
sort
of
ability
and
cloughcough
had
none
he
was
moreover
a
most
disagreeable
person
in
his
regiment
and
constantly
quarrelling
with
his
brother
officers
who
were
delighted
to
get
rid
of
him
to
chronicle
the
seductive
little
arts
which
were
resorted
to
on
that
night
to
effect
a
desired
end
would
half
fill
a
volume
but
i
can
not
omit
the
following
it
struck
me
as
so
ingenious
there
was
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
young
civilian
who
had
two
very
pretty
little
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
of
these
children
the
took
great
notice
and
whenever
he
saw
their
mother
made
inquiries
touching
the
little
pets
as
he
was
wo
to
speak
of
them
on
the
night
of
that
ball
his
lordship
did
so
the
lady
replied
that
they
were
quite
well
but
that
the
doctor
had
said
their
return
to
the
plains
would
be
fatal
to
them
and
that
they
must
be
sent
to
england
then
you
had
better
take
the
doctor
advice
said
the
but
alas
my
lord
said
the
lady
we
have
not
the
means
my
husband
pay
is
only
rupees
a
month
and
we
are
unfortunately
very
much
in
debt
that
a
bad
job
said
my
lord
yes
sighed
the
lady
it
is
a
very
painful
reflection
the
idea
of
losing
one
little
dears
but
what
is
to
be
done
i
dread
the
coming
of
the
of
october
when
my
husband
leave
will
expire
more
than
i
dread
my
own
death
could
you
not
remain
up
here
with
them
through
the
winter
and
be
absent
from
my
husband
my
lord
besides
two
establishments
on
rupees
a
month
that
is
true
if
we
could
them
to
england
under
the
care
of
some
friend
we
would
do
so
before
the
hot
weather
sets
in
but
we
can
not
afford
it
or
if
my
husband
had
an
appointment
in
some
healthy
station
out
of
the
plains
then
they
might
be
spared
to
us
the
thought
of
the
beautiful
roses
on
their
cheeks
just
now
leaving
them
and
their
dear
little
faces
becoming
pale
and
sallow
and
their
little
limbs
shrinking
till
they
are
almost
skeletons
it
makes
my
very
heart
bleed
and
the
pretty
and
ingenious
little
lady
took
her
kerchief
raised
it
to
her
eyes
and
suppressed
something
like
one
of
alfred
stage
sobs
which
went
straight
as
an
arrow
to
the
sensitive
heart
if
she
continued
my
husband
were
a
favourite
with
the
secretary
but
he
is
not
for
he
is
too
independent
to
crave
then
the
case
would
be
very
different
the
secretary
exclaimed
the
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
the
lady
had
aroused
his
lordship
sympathy
and
now
she
had
touched
his
pride
and
inflamed
his
vanity
i
thought
he
had
all
to
do
with
it
my
lord
you
shall
see
that
he
has
said
the
be
comforted
my
dear
madam
and
come
to
the
refreshment
room
his
lordship
gave
her
his
arm
and
led
her
away
from
the
couch
on
which
they
had
been
conversing
this
children
dodge
as
it
was
called
was
eminently
successful
the
lady
husband
was
appointed
superintendent
of
one
of
the
most
delightful
hill
stations
in
india
on
a
salary
of
rupees
per
mensem
the
ball
over
at
two
in
the
morning
we
returned
to
our
house
where
i
was
disgusted
to
hear
that
a
leopard
had
carried
off
out
of
the
verandah
a
favourite
dog
of
mine
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
keep
a
dog
in
simlah
except
in
the
house
the
leopards
are
always
on
the
for
them
and
will
often
carry
them
off
in
your
very
sight
while
you
are
riding
or
walking
along
the
road
the
great
business
at
simlah
as
at
mussoorie
is
devising
the
means
of
amusement
or
rather
of
varying
the
amusements
so
as
to
render
them
less
irksome
than
they
would
otherwise
become
cards
and
billiards
are
the
principal
pastimes
and
now
and
then
and
excursion
parties
are
got
up
and
once
or
twice
a
month
private
theatricals
are
resorted
to
invitations
to
and
are
plentiful
enough
but
to
men
who
go
to
simlah
without
wives
and
families
and
who
do
intend
to
marry
in
the
east
these
reunions
are
a
bore
rather
after
a
brief
while
and
such
men
prefer
dining
under
their
own
roofs
there
was
an
hotel
at
simlah
kept
by
a
frenchman
who
provided
a
every
day
at
seven
this
used
to
be
very
well
attended
for
generally
speaking
better
fare
was
to
be
got
there
than
anywhere
else
by
the
way
the
host
had
once
been
an
officer
in
the
french
army
and
was
rather
a
touchy
man
on
one
occasion
an
officer
complained
of
the
character
of
some
dish
on
the
table
and
was
challenged
to
fight
with
either
sword
or
pistol
this
challenge
was
declined
but
the
officer
said
he
would
have
no
objection
to
an
encounter
provided
the
weapons
were
cold
legs
of
mutton
there
is
an
enormous
mountain
at
simlah
and
around
its
base
there
is
a
good
macadamized
road
some
fifteen
feet
wide
this
is
the
favourite
ride
of
the
visitors
and
every
fine
afternoon
some
sixty
gentlemen
and
nearly
as
many
ladies
may
be
seen
upon
it
taking
the
fresh
air
simlah
is
a
much
more
expensive
place
to
spend
the
summer
at
than
mussoorie
in
consequence
of
its
great
distance
from
the
plains
whence
almost
every
article
of
food
and
all
descriptions
of
stores
are
carried
on
men
shoulders
the
mutton
of
the
hill
sheep
is
not
equal
to
welsh
mutton
but
when
properly
kept
and
dressed
it
is
very
good
eating
the
hill
cattle
also
afford
tolerable
beef
but
the
joints
are
very
small
at
simlah
is
also
much
dearer
the
furnished
abode
for
which
we
paid
for
the
season
we
could
have
got
at
mussoorie
for
the
same
may
be
said
of
articles
of
clothing
and
of
merchandize
the
majority
of
the
european
shopkeepers
there
were
only
five
or
six
appeared
to
be
doing
a
good
business
but
i
question
whether
they
made
money
they
have
to
give
in
most
cases
very
long
credit
pay
high
rates
of
interest
to
the
banks
for
money
and
high
rents
for
the
extensive
premises
they
are
obliged
to
occupy
to
say
nothing
of
having
to
live
as
all
english
people
must
live
in
india
the
hotel
did
not
pay
the
proprietor
notwithstanding
his
house
was
generally
full
of
people
and
his
charges
were
seemingly
exorbitant
there
was
no
club
at
simlah
when
i
was
there
but
since
then
one
was
established
its
existence
however
was
very
brief
the
fact
is
people
in
india
very
soon
grow
tired
of
a
thing
and
what
is
even
worse
you
will
find
that
when
a
large
number
of
persons
who
have
really
nothing
to
do
but
amuse
themselves
very
frequently
meet
they
wrangle
quarrel
split
into
small
coteries
and
become
on
very
bad
terms
with
each
other
how
the
old
himalaya
club
at
mussoorie
has
existed
so
long
is
miraculous
a
club
in
india
is
not
like
a
club
in
england
where
scores
of
the
members
are
unknown
to
each
other
even
by
name
and
possibly
do
not
meet
more
than
once
in
a
month
some
of
the
views
at
simlah
are
magnificent
and
from
several
points
may
be
seen
in
the
far
distance
the
river
sutlej
stealing
its
way
through
the
mountains
the
water
has
the
appearance
when
the
sun
is
shining
upon
it
of
a
narrow
stream
of
quicksilver
some
of
the
hills
are
literally
covered
with
rhododendron
trees
fifty
or
sixty
feet
high
and
when
they
are
all
in
full
bloom
the
effect
may
be
easily
imagined
to
jutsy
some
five
or
six
miles
from
simlah
and
where
one
of
the
goorkha
battalions
was
always
stationed
i
have
already
alluded
there
are
but
two
or
three
bungalows
there
and
they
are
occupied
by
the
officers
of
the
battalion
the
season
that
i
spent
at
simlah
was
a
very
pleasant
one
and
notwithstanding
it
was
enlivened
by
several
exciting
incidents
to
wit
a
duel
a
police
affair
a
court
martial
and
an
elopement
i
was
very
glad
when
it
was
over
and
we
could
return
to
the
plains
tantia
topee
when
i
visited
the
nena
sahib
i
saw
this
miscreant
who
has
since
so
distinguished
himself
as
a
soldier
and
a
general
and
has
recently
been
captured
and
hanged
he
was
not
called
tantia
topee
at
bhithoor
but
bennie
simply
he
was
not
a
servant
exactly
at
all
events
not
a
menial
servant
but
one
of
those
numerous
of
nena
sahib
who
repaid
by
flattery
the
favours
they
received
in
the
shape
of
board
lodging
and
presents
the
name
of
tantia
topee
so
a
native
gentleman
in
india
informs
me
was
an
assumed
one
and
i
will
therefore
speak
of
the
hero
as
bennie
whom
i
remember
sufficiently
well
to
describe
him
i
had
not
the
least
idea
when
i
gave
him
a
general
letter
of
recommendation
that
he
would
fill
so
many
pages
of
indian
history
and
give
brigades
and
divisions
of
british
troops
such
trouble
and
vexation
before
they
succeeded
in
catching
him
bennie
was
not
more
than
thirty
and
at
the
time
of
his
execution
his
age
could
not
have
exceeded
forty
years
i
question
even
if
he
were
so
old
as
that
though
he
may
have
looked
older
he
was
a
man
of
about
the
middle
height
say
five
feet
eight
rather
slightly
made
but
very
erect
he
was
far
from
the
forehead
was
low
the
nose
rather
broad
at
the
nostrils
and
his
teeth
irregular
and
discoloured
his
eyes
were
expressive
and
full
of
cunning
like
those
of
most
asiatics
but
he
did
not
strike
me
as
a
man
of
eminent
ability
there
were
a
few
men
amongst
nena
sahib
flatterers
who
were
really
clever
men
but
they
were
not
mahrattas
and
my
impression
is
that
bennie
was
not
a
mahratta
but
a
member
of
some
obscure
family
in
the
upper
provinces
of
india
under
british
rule
like
the
rest
of
the
tribe
of
flatterers
who
surrounded
nena
sahib
bennie
was
obsequious
and
cringing
to
every
european
who
visited
bhithoor
this
demeanour
of
course
was
not
the
offspring
of
respect
but
prompted
rather
by
the
impression
that
it
might
tend
to
some
advantage
there
are
many
persons
in
india
natives
especially
who
are
of
opinion
that
nena
sahib
did
not
dictate
the
atrocities
that
were
committed
at
cawnpore
but
that
they
were
committed
by
order
of
the
various
adventurers
such
as
bennie
who
became
powerful
the
moment
that
nena
sahib
consented
to
rebel
and
raise
his
standard
asiatics
are
frequently
placed
in
the
awkward
position
of
being
responsible
for
the
acts
of
their
retainers
acts
that
they
not
only
do
not
sanction
but
forbid
this
was
the
case
with
moolraj
the
governor
of
mooltan
from
the
first
and
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
declared
and
his
declaration
was
supported
by
the
very
strongest
circumstantial
evidence
that
so
far
from
giving
an
order
to
his
turbulent
soldiery
to
kill
or
attack
vans
agnew
and
anderson
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
shield
them
from
harm
indeed
the
verdict
of
the
camp
which
condemned
him
rather
inconsistently
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
but
a
victim
of
circumstances
that
nena
sahib
well
deserves
the
fate
that
is
in
store
for
him
whenever
he
is
captured
there
can
be
no
species
of
doubt
but
in
the
absence
of
some
proof
i
should
be
sorry
especially
after
the
letters
i
have
read
on
the
subject
to
attribute
to
the
man
that
fiendish
treachery
and
horrible
massacre
which
took
place
at
cawnpore
in
july
nena
sahib
had
seen
so
much
of
english
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
was
personally
if
not
intimately
acquainted
with
so
many
of
the
sufferers
that
it
is
only
fair
to
suppose
when
he
ordered
boats
to
be
got
ready
he
was
sincere
in
his
desire
that
the
christians
should
find
their
way
to
calcutta
and
that
what
ensued
was
in
violation
of
his
orders
and
the
act
of
those
who
wished
to
place
for
ever
between
nena
sahib
and
the
british
government
an
impassable
barrier
so
far
as
peace
and
reconciliation
were
concerned
no
one
knew
better
than
nena
sahib
that
in
the
event
of
the
british
becoming
again
the
conquerors
of
india
the
very
fact
of
his
having
spared
the
lives
of
those
who
surrendered
would
have
led
to
the
sparing
of
his
own
life
and
hence
the
promise
he
made
to
sir
hugh
wheeler
one
friend
a
gentleman
of
great
experience
writing
from
india
on
this
subject
says
in
my
opinion
it
was
the
mahommedan
soldiery
who
insisted
on
that
awful
measure
having
so
many
helpless
christians
in
their
absolute
power
they
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
sacrificing
them
for
their
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
previous
to
hanging
tantia
topee
some
statement
was
not
extracted
from
him
touching
what
took
place
at
cawnpore
of
course
it
could
not
have
been
relied
upon
but
as
evidence
confirmatory
or
contradictory
of
other
statements
made
by
other
miscreants
who
may
yet
fall
into
our
power
it
would
not
have
been
valueless
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
culprit
should
have
been
allured
to
confess
by
any
promise
or
insinuation
that
his
life
would
be
spared
if
he
spoke
the
truth
that
is
i
would
not
have
breathed
the
word
of
promise
to
his
ear
and
then
have
broken
it
to
the
hope
nor
would
i
have
subjected
him
to
any
torture
nevertheless
i
would
have
had
out
of
him
something
like
the
truth
if
not
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
so
would
sir
john
lawrence
or
wingfield
now
at
lucknow
or
dampier
or
major
elwall
and
a
score
of
officers
now
living
it
is
a
sad
mistake
to
hang
this
sort
of
people
in
a
hurry
or
for
the
matter
of
that
to
hang
them
at
all
they
have
not
that
dread
of
death
that
europeans
have
but
almost
invariably
meet
their
fate
without
exhibiting
the
faintest
fear
there
are
punishments
which
to
their
minds
are
far
more
terrible
they
are
not
as
cowards
who
die
a
thousand
deaths
in
dreading
one
which
must
come
at
last
they
are
rather
cowards
who
die
a
thousand
deaths
in
dreading
one
which
they
long
to
end
i
was
never
more
impressed
with
the
truth
of
this
than
when
with
the
permission
of
lord
dalhousie
i
had
an
interview
with
moolraj
in
his
cell
at
lahore
he
was
then
under
the
charge
of
now
sir
john
logie
who
is
in
attendance
on
the
maharajah
dulleep
singh
the
constant
cry
of
the
wretched
captive
was
ah
let
them
take
my
life
by
one
blow
but
not
draw
it
out
of
me
by
slow
degrees
as
far
as
i
can
recollect
it
was
not
then
decided
whether
his
life
should
be
spared
or
not
i
would
treat
culprits
like
tantia
topee
nena
sahib
bahadoor
khan
the
nawab
of
bandah
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
convicts
of
norfolk
island
were
treated
in
former
days
make
death
the
first
favour
for
which
they
should
crave
and
the
last
which
should
be
granted
unto
them
but
with
this
difference
that
if
they
murdered
each
other
the
hope
of
ending
their
days
for
the
deed
should
be
a
vain
one
to
hang
such
men
is
to
frustrate
the
end
and
real
object
of
all
punishment
which
is
to
deter
others
from
the
commission
of
the
same
offence
when
such
men
are
exterminated
they
are
speedily
forgotten
and
their
end
is
not
regarded
as
an
example
for
the
prevention
of
evil
but
so
long
as
they
are
living
and
suffering
what
to
them
is
far
worse
than
death
the
case
is
otherwise
be
it
known
however
that
i
am
not
an
advocate
for
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
in
country
for
the
crime
of
murder
the
gallows
judiciously
used
is
in
my
humble
judgment
a
very
wholesome
terror
