i
my
uncle
continued
it
was
resolved
that
on
the
same
evening
chrissy
should
tell
my
uncle
her
story
we
went
out
for
a
walk
together
and
though
she
was
not
afraid
to
go
the
least
thing
startled
her
a
voice
behind
her
would
make
her
turn
pale
and
look
hurriedly
round
then
she
would
smile
again
even
before
the
colour
had
had
time
to
come
back
to
her
cheeks
and
say
a
goose
i
am
but
it
is
no
wonder
i
could
see
too
that
she
looked
down
at
her
nice
clothes
now
and
then
with
satisfaction
she
does
not
like
me
to
say
so
but
she
does
not
deny
it
either
for
chrissy
ca
tell
a
story
even
about
her
own
feelings
my
uncle
had
given
us
five
pounds
each
to
spend
and
that
was
jolly
we
bought
each
other
such
a
lot
of
things
besides
some
for
other
people
and
then
we
came
home
and
had
dinner
in
my
uncle
after
which
we
went
up
to
my
uncle
room
and
sat
over
the
fire
in
the
twilight
till
his
was
over
and
he
was
ready
for
his
tea
this
was
ready
for
him
by
the
time
he
awoke
chrissy
got
up
on
the
bed
beside
him
i
got
up
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
facing
her
and
we
had
the
and
plenty
of
between
us
i
happy
said
chrissy
and
began
to
cry
am
i
my
darling
rejoined
uncle
peter
and
followed
her
example
am
i
said
i
i
do
mean
to
cry
about
it
and
then
i
did
we
all
had
one
cup
of
tea
and
some
bread
and
butter
in
silence
after
this
but
when
chrissy
had
poured
out
the
second
cup
for
uncle
peter
she
began
of
her
own
accord
to
tell
us
her
story
was
very
foggy
when
we
came
out
of
school
that
afternoon
as
you
may
remember
dear
uncle
i
do
answered
uncle
peter
with
a
sigh
was
coming
along
the
way
home
with
bessie
you
know
bessie
uncle
and
we
stopped
to
look
in
at
a
bookseller
window
where
the
gas
was
lighted
it
was
full
of
christmas
things
already
one
of
them
i
thought
very
pretty
and
i
was
standing
staring
at
it
when
all
at
once
i
saw
that
a
big
drabby
woman
had
poked
herself
in
between
bessie
and
me
she
was
staring
in
at
the
window
too
she
was
so
nasty
that
i
moved
away
a
little
from
her
but
i
wanted
to
have
one
more
look
at
the
picture
the
woman
came
close
to
me
i
moved
again
again
she
pushed
up
to
me
i
looked
in
her
face
for
i
was
rather
cross
by
this
time
a
horrid
feeling
i
can
not
tell
you
what
it
was
like
came
over
me
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
i
know
how
it
was
now
but
i
did
not
know
then
why
i
was
frightened
i
think
she
saw
i
was
frightened
for
she
instantly
walked
against
me
and
shoved
and
hustled
me
round
the
corner
it
was
a
and
before
i
knew
i
was
in
another
street
it
was
dark
and
narrow
just
at
the
moment
a
man
came
from
the
opposite
side
and
joined
the
woman
then
they
caught
hold
of
my
hands
and
before
my
fright
would
let
me
speak
i
was
deep
into
the
narrow
lane
for
they
ran
with
me
as
fast
as
they
could
then
i
began
to
scream
but
they
said
such
horrid
words
that
i
was
forced
to
hold
my
tongue
and
in
a
minute
more
they
had
me
inside
a
dreadful
house
where
the
plaster
was
dropping
away
from
the
walls
and
the
of
the
house
were
looking
through
i
was
nearly
dead
with
terror
and
disgust
i
think
it
was
a
bit
less
dreadful
to
me
from
having
dim
recollections
of
having
known
such
places
well
enough
at
one
time
of
my
life
i
think
that
only
made
me
the
more
frightened
because
so
the
place
seemed
to
have
a
claim
upon
me
what
if
i
ought
to
be
there
after
all
and
these
dreadful
creatures
were
my
father
and
mother
thought
they
were
going
to
beat
me
at
once
when
the
woman
whom
i
suspected
to
be
my
aunt
began
to
take
off
my
frock
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
but
i
could
not
cry
however
it
was
only
my
clothes
that
they
wanted
but
i
can
not
tell
you
how
frightful
it
was
they
took
almost
everything
i
had
on
and
it
was
only
when
i
began
to
scream
in
despair
sit
still
charlie
it
all
over
now
that
they
stopped
with
a
nod
to
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
can
get
the
rest
afterwards
then
they
put
a
filthy
frock
on
me
brought
me
some
dry
bread
to
eat
locked
the
door
and
left
me
it
was
nearly
dark
now
there
was
no
fire
and
all
my
warm
clothes
were
do
sit
still
i
was
dreadfully
cold
there
was
a
bed
in
one
corner
but
i
think
i
would
have
died
of
cold
rather
than
get
into
it
and
the
air
in
the
place
was
frightful
how
long
i
sat
there
in
the
dark
i
do
know
did
you
do
all
the
time
said
i
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
charlie
i
think
that
is
a
foolish
question
to
ask
what
you
do
chrissy
my
prayers
charlie
then
them
again
nothing
else
i
tried
to
get
out
of
the
window
but
that
was
of
no
use
for
i
could
not
open
it
and
it
was
one
story
high
at
least
what
did
you
do
next
over
all
my
hymns
then
what
you
do
next
do
you
ask
me
so
many
times
i
want
to
know
i
will
tell
i
left
my
prayers
alone
and
i
began
at
the
beginning
and
i
told
god
the
whole
story
as
if
he
had
known
nothing
about
it
from
the
very
beginning
when
uncle
peter
found
me
on
the
crossing
down
to
the
minute
when
i
was
talking
there
to
him
in
the
dark
my
dear
said
my
uncle
with
faltering
voice
felt
better
after
that
i
daresay
and
here
was
i
in
despair
about
you
and
thought
he
did
not
care
for
any
of
us
i
was
very
naughty
indeed
what
next
i
said
and
by
i
heard
a
noise
of
quarrelling
in
the
street
which
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
door
was
burst
open
by
some
one
falling
against
it
blundering
steps
came
up
the
stairs
the
two
who
had
robbed
me
evidently
tipsy
were
trying
to
unlock
the
door
at
length
they
succeeded
and
tumbled
into
the
room
is
the
unnatural
wretch
said
the
woman
ran
away
and
left
her
own
mother
in
poverty
and
sickness
uncle
can
it
be
that
she
is
my
mother
said
chrissy
interrupting
herself
do
think
she
is
answered
uncle
peter
only
wanted
to
vex
you
my
lamb
but
it
does
matter
whether
she
is
or
not
it
uncle
i
am
ashamed
of
her
you
are
god
child
and
he
ca
be
ashamed
of
you
for
he
gave
you
the
mother
you
had
whoever
she
was
and
never
asked
you
which
you
would
have
so
you
need
not
mind
we
ought
always
to
like
best
to
be
just
what
god
has
made
us
am
sure
of
that
well
she
began
groping
about
to
find
me
for
it
was
very
dark
i
sat
quite
still
except
for
trembling
all
over
till
i
felt
her
hands
on
me
when
i
jumped
up
and
she
fell
on
the
floor
she
began
swearing
dreadfully
but
did
not
try
to
get
up
i
crept
away
to
another
corner
i
heard
the
man
snoring
and
the
woman
breathing
loud
then
i
felt
my
way
to
the
door
but
to
my
horror
found
the
man
lying
across
it
on
the
floor
so
that
i
could
not
open
it
then
i
believe
i
cried
for
the
first
time
i
was
nearly
frozen
to
death
and
there
was
all
the
long
night
to
bear
yet
how
i
got
through
it
i
can
not
tell
it
did
go
away
perhaps
god
destroyed
some
of
it
for
me
but
when
the
light
began
to
come
through
the
window
and
show
me
all
the
filth
of
the
place
the
man
and
the
woman
lying
on
the
floor
the
woman
with
her
head
cut
and
covered
with
blood
i
began
to
feel
that
the
darkness
had
been
my
friend
i
felt
this
yet
more
when
i
saw
the
state
of
my
own
dress
which
i
had
forgotten
in
the
dark
i
felt
as
if
i
had
done
some
shameful
thing
and
wanted
to
follow
the
darkness
and
hide
in
the
skirts
of
it
it
was
an
old
gown
of
some
woollen
stuff
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
it
was
so
dirty
and
worn
i
was
ashamed
that
even
those
drunken
creatures
should
wake
and
see
me
in
it
but
the
light
would
come
and
it
came
and
came
until
at
last
it
waked
them
up
and
the
first
words
were
so
dreadful
they
quarrelled
and
swore
at
each
other
and
at
me
until
i
almost
thought
there
could
be
a
god
who
would
let
that
go
on
so
and
never
stop
it
but
i
suppose
he
wants
them
to
stop
and
does
care
to
stop
it
himself
for
he
could
easily
do
that
of
course
if
he
liked
right
my
darling
said
uncle
peter
with
emotion
chrissy
saw
that
my
uncle
was
too
much
excited
by
her
story
although
he
tried
not
to
show
it
and
with
a
wisdom
which
i
have
since
learned
to
appreciate
cut
it
short
did
not
treat
me
cruelly
though
the
worst
was
that
they
gave
me
next
to
nothing
to
eat
perhaps
they
wanted
to
make
me
thin
and
wretched
looking
and
i
believe
they
charlie
you
turn
over
the
cream
if
you
do
sit
three
days
passed
this
way
i
have
thought
all
over
it
and
i
think
they
were
a
little
puzzled
how
to
get
rid
of
me
they
had
no
doubt
watched
me
for
a
long
time
and
now
they
had
got
my
clothes
they
were
at
last
one
night
they
took
me
out
my
aunt
if
aunt
she
is
was
respectably
dressed
that
is
comparatively
and
the
man
had
a
on
which
covered
his
dirty
clothes
they
helped
me
into
a
cart
which
stood
at
the
door
and
drove
off
i
resolved
to
watch
the
way
we
went
but
we
took
so
many
turnings
through
narrow
streets
before
we
came
out
in
a
main
road
that
i
soon
found
it
was
all
one
mass
of
confusion
in
my
head
and
it
was
too
dark
to
read
any
of
the
names
of
the
streets
for
the
man
kept
as
much
in
the
middle
of
the
road
as
possible
we
drove
some
miles
i
should
think
before
we
stopped
at
the
gate
of
a
small
house
with
a
big
porch
which
stood
alone
my
aunt
got
out
and
went
up
to
the
house
and
was
admitted
after
a
few
minutes
she
returned
and
making
me
get
out
she
led
me
up
to
the
house
where
an
elderly
lady
stood
holding
the
door
half
open
when
we
reached
it
my
aunt
gave
me
a
sort
of
shove
in
saying
to
the
lady
she
is
then
she
said
to
me
now
be
a
good
girl
and
do
tell
lies
and
turning
hastily
ran
down
the
steps
and
got
into
the
cart
at
the
gate
which
drove
off
at
once
the
way
we
had
come
the
lady
looked
at
me
from
head
to
foot
sternly
but
kindly
too
i
thought
and
so
glad
was
i
to
find
myself
clear
of
those
dreadful
creatures
that
i
burst
out
crying
she
instantly
began
to
read
me
a
lecture
on
the
privilege
of
being
placed
with
christian
people
who
would
instruct
me
how
my
soul
might
be
saved
and
teach
me
to
lead
an
honest
and
virtuous
life
i
tried
to
say
that
i
had
led
an
honest
life
but
as
often
as
i
opened
my
mouth
to
tell
anything
about
myself
or
my
uncle
or
indeed
to
say
anything
at
all
i
was
stopped
by
her
saying
do
tell
lies
whatever
you
do
do
tell
lies
this
shut
me
up
quite
i
could
not
speak
when
i
knew
she
would
not
believe
me
but
i
did
not
cry
i
only
felt
my
face
get
very
hot
and
somehow
my
grew
longer
though
i
felt
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
she
went
on
must
change
you
dress
i
will
show
you
the
way
to
your
room
and
you
will
find
a
print
gown
there
which
i
hope
you
will
keep
clean
and
above
all
things
do
tell
lies
here
chrissy
burst
out
laughing
as
if
it
was
such
fun
to
be
accused
of
lying
but
presently
her
eyes
filled
and
she
made
haste
to
go
on
may
be
sure
i
made
haste
to
put
on
the
nice
clean
frock
and
to
my
delight
found
other
clean
things
for
me
as
well
i
declare
i
felt
like
a
princess
for
a
whole
day
after
notwithstanding
the
occupation
for
i
soon
found
that
i
had
been
made
over
to
sprinx
as
a
servant
of
all
work
i
think
she
must
have
paid
these
people
for
the
chance
of
reclaiming
one
whom
they
had
represented
as
at
least
a
great
liar
whether
my
wages
were
to
be
paid
to
them
or
even
what
they
were
to
be
i
never
heard
i
made
up
my
mind
at
once
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
do
the
work
without
grumbling
and
do
it
as
well
as
i
could
for
that
would
be
doing
no
harm
to
anyone
but
the
contrary
while
it
would
give
me
the
better
chance
of
making
my
escape
but
though
i
was
determined
to
get
away
the
first
opportunity
and
was
miserable
when
i
thought
how
anxious
you
would
all
be
about
me
yet
i
confess
it
was
such
a
relief
to
be
clean
and
in
respectable
company
that
i
caught
myself
singing
once
or
twice
the
very
first
day
but
the
old
lady
soon
stopped
that
she
was
about
in
the
kitchen
the
greater
part
of
the
day
till
almost
and
taught
me
how
to
cook
and
save
my
soul
both
at
once
interrupted
uncle
peter
have
read
receipts
for
the
salvation
of
the
soul
that
sounded
very
much
as
if
they
came
out
of
a
and
the
wrinkles
of
his
laugh
went
up
into
his
neither
chrissy
nor
i
understood
this
at
the
time
but
i
have
often
thought
of
it
since
chrissy
went
on
had
finished
washing
up
my
and
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
for
i
was
tired
i
was
staring
into
the
fire
and
thinking
and
thinking
how
i
should
get
away
and
what
i
should
do
when
i
got
out
of
the
house
and
feeling
as
if
the
man
and
the
woman
were
always
prowling
about
it
and
watching
me
through
the
window
when
suddenly
i
saw
a
little
boy
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
staring
at
me
with
great
brown
eyes
he
was
a
little
boy
perhaps
about
six
years
old
with
a
pale
face
and
very
earnest
look
i
did
not
speak
to
him
but
waited
to
see
what
he
would
do
a
few
minutes
passed
and
i
forgot
him
but
as
i
was
wiping
my
eyes
which
would
get
wet
sometimes
notwithstanding
my
he
came
up
to
me
and
said
in
a
timid
whisper
you
a
princess
makes
you
think
that
i
said
have
got
such
white
hands
he
answered
i
am
not
a
princess
i
said
you
cinderella
my
darling
i
replied
something
like
her
for
they
have
stolen
me
away
from
home
and
brought
me
here
i
wish
i
could
get
away
here
i
confess
i
burst
into
a
down
right
fit
of
crying
cry
said
the
little
fellow
stroking
my
cheek
will
let
you
out
some
time
shall
you
be
able
to
find
your
way
home
all
by
yourself
i
think
so
i
answered
but
at
the
same
time
i
felt
very
doubtful
about
it
because
i
always
fancied
those
people
watching
me
but
before
either
of
us
spoke
again
in
came
sprinx
naughty
boy
what
business
have
you
to
make
the
servant
neglect
her
work
i
was
still
sitting
by
the
fire
and
my
arm
was
round
the
dear
little
fellow
and
his
head
was
leaning
on
my
shoulder
not
a
servant
auntie
cried
he
indignantly
a
real
princess
though
of
course
she
wo
own
to
it
lies
you
have
been
telling
the
boy
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
come
along
directly
get
the
tea
at
once
jane
little
friend
went
with
his
aunt
and
i
rose
and
got
the
tea
but
i
felt
much
since
i
had
the
sympathy
of
the
little
boy
to
comfort
me
only
i
was
afraid
they
would
make
him
hate
me
but
although
i
saw
very
little
of
him
the
rest
of
the
time
i
knew
they
had
not
succeeded
in
doing
so
for
as
often
as
he
could
he
would
come
sliding
up
to
me
saying
do
you
do
princess
then
run
away
afraid
of
being
seen
and
scolded
was
getting
very
desperate
about
making
my
escape
for
there
was
a
high
wall
about
the
place
and
the
gate
was
always
locked
at
night
when
came
i
was
nearly
crazy
with
thinking
that
was
uncle
birthday
and
that
i
should
not
be
with
him
but
that
very
night
after
i
had
gone
to
my
room
the
door
opened
and
in
came
little
eddie
in
his
nightgown
his
eyes
looking
very
bright
and
black
over
it
princess
said
he
is
the
key
of
the
gate
run
took
him
in
my
arms
and
kissed
him
unable
to
speak
he
struggled
to
get
free
and
ran
to
the
door
there
he
turned
and
said
will
come
back
and
see
me
some
day
will
you
not
i
will
i
answered
you
shall
said
uncle
peter
hid
the
key
and
went
to
bed
where
i
lay
trembling
as
soon
as
i
was
sure
they
must
be
asleep
i
rose
and
dressed
i
had
no
bonnet
or
shawl
but
those
i
had
come
in
and
though
they
disgusted
me
i
thought
it
better
to
put
them
on
but
i
dared
not
unlock
the
for
fear
of
making
a
noise
so
i
crept
out
of
the
and
then
i
got
out
at
the
gate
all
safe
no
one
was
in
sight
so
i
locked
it
again
and
threw
the
key
over
but
what
a
time
of
fear
and
wandering
about
i
had
in
the
darkness
before
i
dared
to
ask
any
one
the
way
it
was
a
bright
clear
night
and
i
walked
very
quietly
till
i
came
upon
a
great
wide
common
the
sky
and
the
stars
and
the
wideness
frightened
me
and
made
me
gasp
at
first
i
felt
as
if
i
should
fall
away
from
everything
into
nothing
and
it
was
so
lonely
but
then
i
thought
of
god
and
in
a
moment
i
knew
that
what
i
had
thought
loneliness
was
really
the
presence
of
god
and
then
i
grew
brave
again
and
walked
on
when
the
morning
dawned
i
met
a
bricklayer
going
to
his
work
and
found
that
i
had
been
wandering
away
from
london
all
the
time
but
i
did
not
mind
that
now
i
turned
my
face
towards
it
though
not
the
way
i
had
come
but
i
soon
got
dreadfully
tired
and
faint
and
once
i
think
i
fainted
quite
i
went
up
to
a
house
and
asked
for
a
piece
of
bread
and
they
gave
it
to
me
and
i
felt
much
better
after
eating
it
but
i
had
to
rest
so
often
and
got
so
tired
and
my
feet
got
so
sore
that
you
know
how
late
it
was
before
i
got
home
to
my
darling
uncle
me
too
i
expostulated
you
too
charlie
she
answered
and
we
all
cried
over
again
sha
happen
any
more
said
my
uncle
after
tea
was
over
he
asked
for
writing
things
and
wrote
a
note
which
he
sent
off
the
next
morning
about
eleven
as
i
was
looking
out
of
the
window
i
saw
a
carriage
drive
up
and
stop
at
our
door
a
pretty
little
brougham
i
cried
such
a
jolly
horse
look
here
chrissy
presently
uncle
peter
bell
rang
and
miss
chrissy
was
sent
for
she
came
down
again
radiant
with
pleasure
do
you
think
charlie
that
carriage
is
mine
all
my
own
and
i
am
to
go
to
school
in
it
always
do
come
and
have
a
ride
in
it
you
may
be
sure
i
was
delighted
to
do
so
shall
we
go
i
said
us
ask
uncle
if
we
may
go
and
see
the
little
darling
who
set
me
free
his
consent
was
soon
obtained
and
away
we
went
it
was
a
long
drive
but
we
enjoyed
it
beyond
everything
when
we
reached
the
house
we
were
shown
into
the
there
was
sprinx
and
little
eddie
the
lady
stared
but
the
child
knew
cinderella
at
once
and
flew
into
her
arms
knew
you
were
a
princess
he
cried
auntie
but
sprinx
had
put
on
an
injured
look
and
her
hands
shook
very
much
miss
belper
if
that
is
your
name
you
have
behaved
in
a
most
unaccountable
way
why
did
you
not
tell
me
instead
of
stealing
the
key
of
the
gate
and
breaking
the
kitchen
window
a
most
improper
way
for
a
young
lady
to
behave
to
run
out
of
the
house
at
midnight
forget
madam
replied
chrissy
with
more
dignity
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
assume
as
soon
as
ever
i
attempted
to
open
my
mouth
you
told
me
not
to
tell
lies
you
believed
the
wicked
people
who
brought
me
here
rather
than
myself
however
as
you
will
not
be
friendly
i
think
we
had
better
go
come
charlie
go
princess
pleaded
little
eddie
i
must
for
your
auntie
does
not
like
me
said
chrissy
am
sure
i
always
meant
to
do
my
duty
by
you
and
i
will
do
so
beware
my
dear
young
woman
of
the
deceitfulness
of
riches
your
carriage
wo
save
your
soul
chrissy
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
rude
as
she
confessed
when
we
got
out
but
she
did
not
she
made
her
bow
turned
and
walked
away
i
followed
and
poor
eddie
would
have
done
so
too
but
was
laid
hold
of
by
his
aunt
i
confess
this
was
not
quite
proper
behaviour
on
chrissy
part
but
i
never
discovered
that
till
she
made
me
see
it
she
was
very
sorry
afterwards
and
my
uncle
feared
the
brougham
had
begun
to
hurt
her
already
as
she
told
me
for
she
had
narrated
the
whole
story
to
him
and
his
look
first
let
her
see
that
she
had
been
wrong
my
uncle
went
with
her
afterwards
to
see
sprinx
and
thank
her
for
having
done
her
best
and
to
take
eddie
such
presents
as
my
uncle
only
knew
how
to
buy
for
children
when
he
went
to
school
i
know
he
sent
him
a
gold
watch
from
that
time
till
now
that
she
is
my
wife
chrissy
has
had
no
more
such
adventures
and
if
uncle
peter
did
not
die
on
it
did
not
matter
much
for
makes
all
the
days
of
the
year
as
sacred
as
itself
chapter
ii
the
giant
heart
when
harry
had
finished
reading
the
colonel
gallantly
declared
that
the
story
was
the
best
they
had
had
armstrong
received
this
as
a
joke
and
begged
him
not
to
be
so
unsparing
ah
armstrong
returned
he
laughing
you
are
not
old
enough
yet
to
know
the
truth
from
a
joke
do
you
agree
with
me
about
the
story
mrs
cathcart
i
think
it
is
very
pretty
and
romantic
such
men
as
uncle
peter
are
not
very
common
in
the
world
the
story
is
not
too
true
to
nature
this
she
said
in
a
tone
intended
to
indicate
superior
acquaintance
with
the
world
and
its
nature
i
fear
cathcart
and
some
others
whom
i
could
name
mean
by
something
very
bad
indeed
which
yet
an
artist
is
bound
to
be
loyal
to
the
colonel
however
seemed
to
be
of
a
different
opinion
if
there
never
was
such
a
man
as
uncle
peter
said
he
there
ought
to
have
been
and
it
is
all
the
more
reason
for
putting
him
into
a
story
that
he
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
world
bravo
cried
i
you
have
answered
a
great
question
in
a
few
words
i
do
know
rejoined
our
host
have
i
it
seems
to
me
as
plain
as
the
catechism
i
thought
he
might
have
found
a
more
apt
simile
but
i
held
my
peace
next
morning
i
walked
out
in
the
snow
since
the
storm
of
that
terrible
night
it
had
fallen
again
quietly
and
plentifully
and
now
in
the
sunlight
the
world
houses
and
trees
ponds
and
rivers
was
like
a
creation
more
than
blocked
out
but
far
from
finished
in
marble
and
this
i
said
to
myself
as
i
regarded
the
wondrous
loveliness
with
which
the
snow
had
at
once
clothed
and
disfigured
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
this
is
what
has
come
of
the
chaos
of
falling
flakes
to
this
repose
of
beauty
has
that
storm
settled
and
sunk
will
it
not
be
so
with
our
mental
storms
as
well
but
here
the
figure
displeased
me
for
those
were
not
the
true
right
shapes
of
the
things
and
the
truth
does
not
stick
to
things
but
shows
itself
out
of
them
this
lovely
show
i
said
is
the
result
of
a
busy
fancy
this
white
world
is
the
creation
of
a
poet
such
as
shelley
in
whom
the
fancy
was
too
much
for
the
intellect
fancy
settles
upon
anything
half
destroys
its
form
half
beautifies
it
with
something
that
is
not
its
own
but
the
true
creative
imagination
the
and
the
falls
like
the
rain
in
the
spring
night
vanishing
amid
the
roots
of
the
trees
not
settling
upon
them
in
clouds
of
wintry
white
but
breaking
forth
from
them
in
clouds
of
summer
green
and
then
my
thoughts
very
naturally
went
from
nature
to
my
niece
and
i
asked
myself
whether
within
the
last
few
days
i
had
not
seen
upon
her
countenance
the
expression
of
a
mental
for
the
mind
has
its
seasons
four
with
many
changes
as
well
as
the
world
only
that
the
cycles
are
generally
longer
they
can
hardly
be
more
mingled
than
as
here
in
our
climate
let
me
confess
now
that
the
subject
of
the
confession
no
longer
exists
that
there
had
been
something
about
adela
that
of
mine
as
she
was
had
troubled
me
in
all
her
behaviour
so
far
as
i
had
had
any
opportunity
of
judging
she
had
been
as
good
as
my
desires
at
least
but
there
was
a
want
in
her
face
a
certain
flatness
of
expression
which
i
did
not
like
i
love
the
common
with
all
my
heart
but
i
hate
the
and
foolish
old
bachelor
that
i
am
the
in
a
woman
troubles
me
annoys
me
makes
me
miserable
well
it
was
something
of
the
in
adela
expression
that
had
troubled
me
her
eyes
were
clear
with
lovely
long
dark
lashes
but
somehow
the
light
in
them
had
been
always
the
same
and
occasionally
when
i
talked
to
her
of
the
things
i
most
wished
her
to
care
about
there
was
such
an
immobile
condition
of
the
features
associated
with
such
a
ready
assent
in
words
that
i
felt
her
notion
of
what
i
meant
must
be
something
very
different
indeed
from
what
i
did
mean
her
face
looked
as
if
it
were
made
of
something
too
thick
for
the
inward
light
to
shine
through
wax
and
not
living
muscle
and
skin
the
fact
was
the
light
within
had
not
been
kindled
else
that
face
of
hers
would
have
been
ready
enough
to
let
it
shine
out
hitherto
she
had
not
seemed
to
me
to
belong
at
all
to
that
company
that
praises
god
with
sweet
looks
as
thomas
hood
describes
ruth
as
doing
what
was
wanting
i
had
found
it
difficult
to
define
her
soul
was
asleep
she
was
dreaming
a
child
dreams
instead
of
seeing
a
woman
realities
realities
that
awake
the
swift
play
of
feature
as
the
wind
of
god
arouses
the
expression
of
a
still
landscape
so
there
seemed
after
all
a
gulf
between
her
and
me
she
did
not
see
what
i
saw
feel
what
i
felt
seek
what
i
sought
occasionally
even
the
delicate
young
girl
pure
and
bright
as
the
snow
that
hung
on
the
boughs
around
me
would
shock
the
wizened
old
bachelor
with
her
worldliness
a
worldliness
that
lay
only
in
the
use
of
current
worldly
phrases
of
selfish
contentment
or
selfish
care
ah
how
little
do
young
beauties
understand
of
the
pitiful
emotions
which
they
sometimes
rouse
in
the
breasts
of
men
whom
they
suppose
to
be
absorbed
in
admiration
of
them
but
for
faith
that
these
girls
are
god
work
and
only
half
made
yet
one
would
turn
from
them
with
sadness
almost
painful
dislike
and
take
refuge
with
some
grandmother
or
withered
old
maid
whose
features
tell
of
sorrow
and
patience
and
the
beauty
would
think
with
herself
that
such
a
gentleman
did
not
admire
pretty
girls
and
was
severe
and
unkind
and
puritanical
whereas
it
was
the
lack
of
beauty
that
made
him
turn
away
the
disappointment
of
a
face
dull
that
ought
to
be
radiant
or
the
presence
of
only
that
sort
of
beauty
which
in
middle
age
except
the
deeper
nature
should
meantime
come
into
play
would
be
worse
than
would
be
mingled
with
the
trail
of
more
or
less
guilty
sensuality
many
a
woman
at
forty
is
repulsive
whom
common
men
found
at
twenty
irresistibly
attractive
and
many
a
woman
at
seventy
is
lovely
to
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
would
have
been
compelled
to
allow
that
she
was
decidedly
plain
at
seventeen
maidens
bairns
are
aye
weel
guided
says
the
scotch
proverb
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
bachelors
wives
so
i
will
cease
the
strain
and
return
to
adela
the
change
in
whom
first
roused
it
of
late
i
had
seen
a
glimmer
of
something
in
her
countenance
which
i
had
never
seen
before
a
something
which
the
first
time
i
perceived
it
made
me
say
to
her
in
my
own
hearing
only
ah
my
dear
we
shall
understand
each
other
by
and
by
and
now
and
then
the
light
in
her
eye
would
be
dimmed
as
by
the
of
a
tear
when
there
was
no
immediate
and
visible
cause
to
account
for
it
and
which
was
very
strange
i
could
not
help
fancying
she
began
to
be
a
little
shy
of
her
old
could
it
be
that
she
was
afraid
of
his
insight
reaching
to
her
heart
and
reading
there
more
than
she
was
yet
willing
to
confess
to
herself
but
whatever
the
cause
of
the
change
might
be
there
was
certainly
a
responsiveness
in
her
a
readiness
to
meet
every
utterance
and
take
it
home
by
which
the
vanity
of
the
old
bachelor
would
have
been
flattered
to
the
full
had
not
his
heart
come
first
and
forestalled
the
delight
so
absorbed
was
i
in
considering
these
things
that
the
time
passed
like
one
of
my
thoughts
and
before
i
knew
i
found
myself
on
the
verge
of
the
perilous
moor
over
which
harry
had
ridden
in
the
teeth
and
heart
of
the
storm
how
smooth
yet
cruel
it
looked
in
its
thick
covering
of
snow
there
was
heather
beneath
within
which
lay
millions
of
purple
bells
ready
to
rush
out
at
the
call
of
summer
and
ring
peals
of
merry
gladness
making
the
desolate
place
not
only
blossom
but
rejoice
as
the
rose
and
there
were
cold
wells
of
brown
water
beneath
that
snow
of
depth
unknown
which
nourished
nothing
but
the
green
grass
that
hid
the
cold
glare
of
their
presence
from
the
eyes
of
the
else
warefully
affrighted
traveller
and
i
thought
of
adela
when
i
thought
of
the
heather
and
of
some
other
woman
whom
i
had
known
when
i
thought
of
the
wells
when
i
came
home
i
told
adela
where
i
had
been
and
what
a
desolate
place
it
was
and
the
flush
that
rose
on
her
pale
cheek
was
just
like
the
light
of
the
sunset
which
i
had
left
shining
over
the
whiteness
of
that
snowy
region
and
i
said
to
myself
it
so
and
i
trust
it
may
be
well
as
i
walked
home
i
had
bethought
myself
of
a
story
which
i
had
brought
down
with
me
in
the
hope
of
a
chance
of
reading
it
but
which
illness
had
put
out
of
my
mind
for
it
was
only
a
child
story
and
although
i
hoped
older
people
might
find
something
in
it
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
read
it
without
the
presence
of
little
children
so
i
said
to
adela
do
you
know
any
little
children
in
purleybridge
adela
oh
yes
plenty
could
you
ask
some
of
them
one
night
and
i
would
tell
them
a
story
i
think
at
this
season
they
should
have
a
share
in
what
is
going
and
i
have
got
one
i
think
they
would
like
i
shall
be
delighted
i
will
speak
to
papa
about
it
at
once
but
next
time
yes
i
know
next
time
harry
armstrong
was
going
to
read
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
adela
i
doubt
if
he
will
be
ready
i
know
he
is
dreadfully
busy
just
now
and
i
believe
he
will
be
thankful
to
have
a
reprieve
for
a
day
or
two
and
his
story
which
i
expect
will
be
a
good
one
will
be
all
the
better
for
it
then
i
will
speak
to
papa
about
it
the
moment
he
comes
in
and
you
will
tell
henry
and
mind
uncle
you
take
the
change
upon
your
own
shoulders
trust
me
my
dear
i
said
as
i
left
the
room
as
i
had
anticipated
harry
was
grateful
everything
was
arranged
so
the
next
evening
but
one
we
had
a
merry
pretty
company
of
boys
and
girls
none
older
or
at
least
looking
older
than
twelve
it
did
my
heart
good
to
see
how
adela
made
herself
at
home
with
them
and
talked
to
them
as
if
she
were
one
of
themselves
by
the
time
tea
was
over
i
had
made
friends
with
them
all
which
was
a
stroke
in
its
way
nearly
equal
to
chaucer
who
made
friends
with
all
the
nine
and
twenty
canterbury
pilgrims
before
the
sun
was
down
and
the
way
i
did
was
this
i
began
with
the
one
next
me
asking
her
the
question
do
you
like
yes
i
do
answered
she
heartily
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
princess
with
the
blue
foot
no
will
you
tell
me
please
then
i
turned
to
the
one
on
my
other
side
and
asked
her
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
giant
that
was
all
skin
not
skin
and
bone
you
know
but
all
skin
she
answered
and
her
round
blue
eyes
got
rounder
and
bluer
the
next
was
a
boy
i
asked
him
did
you
ever
hear
of
don
worm
of
wakemup
no
do
please
tell
us
about
it
and
so
i
asked
them
round
the
room
and
by
that
time
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
then
i
said
you
see
i
can
not
tell
you
all
these
stories
but
would
you
all
like
one
of
some
sort
a
chorus
of
filled
the
room
what
shall
it
be
about
then
a
wicked
fairy
no
that
stupid
i
tired
of
wicked
fairies
said
a
scornful
little
girl
a
good
giant
then
said
a
priggish
imp
with
a
face
as
round
as
the
late
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
tell
you
a
story
about
a
giant
for
unfortunately
all
the
good
giants
i
ever
heard
of
were
very
stupid
so
stupid
that
a
story
would
not
make
itself
about
them
so
stupid
indeed
that
they
were
always
made
game
of
by
creatures
not
half
so
big
or
half
so
good
and
i
do
like
such
stories
shall
i
tell
you
about
the
wicked
giant
that
grew
little
children
in
his
garden
instead
of
radishes
and
then
carried
them
about
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
ate
one
as
often
as
he
remembered
he
had
got
some
yes
yes
please
do
he
used
to
catch
little
children
and
plant
them
in
his
garden
where
you
might
see
them
in
rows
with
their
heads
only
above
ground
rolling
their
eyes
about
and
growing
awfully
fast
he
liked
greedy
boys
best
boys
that
ate
till
they
felt
as
if
their
belts
were
too
tight
here
the
boy
stuck
both
his
hands
inside
his
belt
because
he
was
so
fond
of
radishes
i
went
on
he
lived
just
on
the
borders
of
giantland
where
it
touched
on
the
country
of
common
people
now
everything
in
giantland
was
so
big
that
the
common
people
saw
only
a
mass
of
awful
mountains
and
clouds
and
no
living
man
had
ever
come
from
it
as
far
as
anybody
knew
to
tell
what
he
had
seen
in
it
somewhere
near
these
borders
on
the
other
side
by
the
edge
of
a
great
forest
lived
a
labourer
with
his
wife
and
a
great
many
children
one
day
as
they
called
her
teased
her
brother
till
he
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
and
gave
her
a
box
on
the
ear
cried
and
was
so
sorry
and
ashamed
of
himself
that
he
cried
too
and
ran
off
into
the
wood
he
was
so
long
gone
that
began
to
be
frightened
for
she
was
very
fond
of
her
brother
and
she
was
so
sorry
that
she
had
first
teased
him
and
then
cried
that
at
last
she
ran
into
the
wood
to
look
for
him
though
there
was
more
chance
of
losing
herself
than
of
finding
him
and
indeed
so
it
seemed
likely
to
turn
out
for
running
on
without
looking
she
at
length
found
herself
in
a
valley
she
knew
nothing
about
and
no
wonder
for
what
she
thought
was
a
valley
with
round
rocky
sides
was
no
other
than
the
space
between
two
of
the
roots
of
a
great
tree
that
grew
on
the
borders
of
giantland
she
climbed
over
the
side
of
it
and
right
up
to
what
she
took
for
a
black
mountain
far
away
but
she
soon
discovered
that
it
was
close
to
her
and
was
a
hollow
place
so
great
that
she
could
not
tell
what
it
was
hollowed
out
of
staring
at
it
she
found
that
it
was
a
doorway
and
going
nearer
and
staring
harder
she
saw
the
door
far
in
with
a
knocker
of
iron
upon
it
a
great
many
yards
above
her
head
and
as
large
as
the
anchor
of
a
big
ship
now
nobody
had
ever
been
unkind
to
and
therefore
she
was
not
afraid
of
anybody
for
box
on
the
ear
she
did
not
think
worth
considering
so
spying
a
little
hole
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
which
had
been
nibbled
by
some
giant
mouse
she
crept
through
it
and
found
herself
in
an
enormous
hall
as
big
as
if
the
late
martin
had
been
the
architect
she
could
not
have
seen
the
other
end
of
it
at
all
except
for
the
great
fire
that
was
burning
there
diminished
to
a
spark
in
the
distance
towards
this
fire
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
and
was
not
far
from
it
when
something
fell
before
her
with
a
great
clatter
over
which
she
tumbled
and
went
rolling
on
the
floor
she
was
not
much
hurt
however
and
got
up
in
a
moment
then
she
saw
that
she
had
fallen
over
something
not
unlike
a
great
iron
bucket
when
she
examined
it
more
closely
she
discovered
that
it
was
a
thimble
and
looking
up
to
see
who
had
dropped
it
beheld
a
huge
face
with
spectacles
as
big
as
the
round
windows
in
a
church
bending
over
her
and
looking
everywhere
for
the
thimble
immediately
laid
hold
of
it
in
both
her
arms
and
lifted
it
about
an
inch
nearer
to
the
nose
of
the
peering
giantess
this
movement
made
the
old
lady
see
where
it
was
and
her
finger
popping
into
it
it
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
buried
in
the
folds
of
a
white
stocking
like
a
cloud
in
the
sky
which
mrs
giant
was
busy
darning
for
it
was
saturday
night
and
her
husband
would
wear
nothing
but
white
stockings
on
sunday
but
how
could
he
be
so
particular
about
white
stockings
on
sunday
and
eat
little
children
asked
one
of
the
group
why
to
be
sure
i
answered
he
did
eat
little
children
but
only
little
ones
and
if
ever
it
crossed
his
mind
that
it
was
wrong
to
do
so
he
always
said
to
himself
that
he
wore
whiter
stockings
on
sunday
than
any
other
giant
in
all
giantland
at
that
instant
heard
a
sound
like
the
wind
in
a
tree
full
of
leaves
and
could
not
think
what
it
could
be
till
looking
up
she
found
that
it
was
the
giantess
whispering
to
her
and
when
she
tried
very
hard
she
could
hear
what
she
said
well
enough
away
dear
little
girl
she
said
fast
as
you
can
for
my
husband
will
be
home
in
a
few
minutes
i
never
been
naughty
to
your
husband
said
looking
up
in
the
giantess
face
does
matter
you
had
better
go
he
is
fond
of
little
children
particularly
little
girls
then
he
wo
hurt
me
am
not
sure
of
that
he
is
so
fond
of
them
that
he
eats
them
up
and
i
am
afraid
he
could
help
hurting
you
a
little
he
a
very
good
man
though
then
began
feeling
rather
frightened
but
before
she
could
finish
her
sentence
she
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
very
far
apart
and
very
heavy
the
next
moment
who
should
come
running
towards
her
full
speed
and
as
pale
as
death
but
she
held
out
her
arms
and
he
ran
into
them
but
when
she
tried
to
kiss
him
she
only
kissed
the
back
of
his
head
for
his
white
face
and
round
eyes
were
turned
to
the
door
children
run
and
hide
said
the
giantess
buffy
said
tricksey
a
great
brake
we
hide
in
it
the
brake
was
a
big
broom
and
they
had
just
got
into
the
bristles
of
it
when
they
heard
the
door
open
with
a
sound
of
thunder
and
in
stalked
the
giant
you
would
have
thought
you
saw
the
whole
earth
through
the
door
when
he
opened
it
so
wide
was
it
and
when
he
closed
it
it
was
like
nightfall
is
that
little
boy
he
cried
with
a
voice
like
the
bellowing
of
cannon
looked
a
very
nice
boy
indeed
i
am
almost
sure
he
crept
through
the
mouse
hole
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
where
is
he
my
dear
do
know
answered
the
giantess
you
know
it
is
wicked
to
tell
lies
do
you
dear
retorted
the
giant
you
ridiculous
old
thunderthump
said
his
wife
with
a
smile
as
broad
as
the
sea
in
the
sun
can
i
mend
your
white
stockings
and
look
after
little
boys
you
have
got
plenty
to
last
you
over
sunday
i
am
sure
just
look
what
good
little
boys
they
are
and
peered
through
the
bristles
and
discovered
a
row
of
little
boys
about
a
dozen
with
very
fat
faces
and
goggle
eyes
sitting
before
the
fire
and
looking
stupidly
into
it
thunderthump
intended
the
most
of
these
for
seed
and
was
feeding
them
well
before
planting
them
now
and
then
however
he
could
not
keep
his
teeth
off
them
and
would
eat
one
by
the
bye
without
salt
now
you
know
that
all
nonsense
for
little
children
do
grow
in
gardens
i
know
may
believe
in
the
radish
beds
do
said
one
pert
little
puss
i
never
said
i
did
replied
i
if
the
giant
did
that
enough
for
my
story
i
told
you
the
good
giants
are
very
stupid
so
you
may
think
what
the
bad
ones
are
indeed
the
giant
never
really
tried
the
plan
no
doubt
he
did
plant
the
children
but
he
always
pulled
them
up
and
ate
them
before
they
had
a
chance
of
increasing
he
strode
up
to
the
wretched
children
now
what
made
them
very
wretched
indeed
was
that
they
knew
if
they
could
only
keep
from
eating
and
grow
thin
the
giant
would
dislike
them
and
turn
them
out
to
find
their
way
home
but
notwithstanding
this
so
greedy
were
they
that
they
ate
as
much
as
ever
they
could
hold
the
giantess
who
fed
them
comforted
herself
with
thinking
that
they
were
not
real
boys
and
girls
but
only
little
pigs
pretending
to
be
boys
and
girls
tell
me
the
truth
cried
the
giant
bending
his
face
down
over
them
they
shook
with
terror
and
every
one
hoped
it
was
somebody
else
the
giant
liked
best
is
the
little
boy
that
ran
into
the
hall
just
now
whoever
tells
me
a
lie
shall
be
instantly
boiled
in
the
broom
cried
one
boy
in
there
and
a
little
girl
with
him
naughty
children
cried
the
giant
hide
from
and
he
made
a
stride
towards
the
broom
hold
of
the
bristles
bobby
get
right
into
a
tuft
and
hold
on
cried
just
in
time
the
giant
caught
up
the
broom
and
seeing
nothing
under
it
set
it
down
again
with
a
bang
that
threw
them
both
on
the
floor
he
then
made
two
strides
to
the
boys
caught
the
one
by
the
neck
took
the
lid
off
a
great
pot
that
was
boiling
on
the
fire
popped
him
in
as
if
he
had
been
a
trussed
chicken
put
the
lid
on
again
and
saying
boys
see
what
comes
of
lying
asked
no
more
questions
for
as
he
always
kept
his
word
he
was
afraid
he
might
have
to
do
the
same
to
them
all
and
he
did
not
like
boiled
boys
he
like
to
eat
them
crisp
as
radishes
whether
forked
or
not
ought
to
be
eaten
he
then
sat
down
and
asked
his
wife
if
his
supper
was
ready
she
looked
into
the
pot
and
throwing
the
boy
out
with
the
ladle
as
if
he
had
been
a
that
had
tumbled
in
and
had
had
the
worst
of
it
answered
that
she
thought
it
was
whereupon
he
rose
to
help
her
and
taking
the
pot
from
the
fire
poured
the
whole
contents
bubbling
and
splashing
into
a
dish
like
a
vat
then
they
say
down
to
supper
the
children
in
the
broom
could
not
see
what
they
had
but
it
seemed
to
agree
with
them
for
the
giant
talked
like
thunder
and
the
giantess
answered
like
the
sea
and
they
grew
chattier
and
chattier
at
length
the
giant
said
do
feel
quite
comfortable
about
that
heart
of
mine
and
as
he
spoke
instead
of
laying
his
hand
on
his
bosom
he
waved
it
away
towards
the
corner
where
the
children
were
peeping
from
the
like
frightened
little
mice
you
know
my
darling
thunderthump
answered
his
wife
always
thought
it
ought
to
be
nearer
home
but
you
know
best
of
course
ha
you
do
know
where
it
is
wife
i
moved
it
a
month
ago
a
man
you
are
thunderthump
you
trust
any
creature
alive
rather
than
your
wife
here
the
giantess
gave
a
sob
which
sounded
exactly
like
a
wave
going
flop
into
the
mouth
of
a
cave
up
to
the
roof
have
you
got
it
now
she
resumed
checking
her
emotion
doodlem
i
do
mind
telling
said
the
giant
soothingly
great
has
got
it
for
a
she
sits
on
it
night
and
day
and
thinks
she
will
bring
the
greatest
eagle
out
of
it
that
ever
sharpened
his
beak
on
the
rocks
of
mount
skycrack
i
can
warrant
no
one
else
will
touch
it
while
she
has
got
it
but
she
is
rather
capricious
and
i
confess
i
am
not
easy
about
it
for
the
least
scratch
of
one
of
her
claws
would
do
for
me
at
once
and
she
claws
what
funny
things
you
do
make
up
said
a
boy
how
could
the
heart
be
in
an
eagle
nest
and
the
giant
himself
alive
and
well
without
it
whatever
you
may
think
of
it
master
fred
i
assure
you
i
did
not
make
it
up
if
it
ever
was
made
up
no
one
can
tell
who
did
it
for
it
was
written
in
the
chronicles
of
giantland
long
before
one
of
us
was
born
it
was
quite
common
said
i
in
an
injured
tone
for
a
giant
to
put
his
heart
out
to
nurse
because
he
did
not
like
the
trouble
and
responsibility
of
doing
it
himself
it
was
i
confess
a
dangerous
sort
of
thing
to
but
do
you
want
any
more
of
my
story
or
not
oh
yes
please
cried
frederick
very
heartily
then
do
you
find
any
more
fault
with
it
or
i
will
stop
master
fred
was
straightway
silent
and
i
went
on
all
this
time
and
were
listening
with
long
ears
did
not
dispute
about
the
giant
heart
and
impossibility
and
all
that
for
they
were
better
educated
than
master
fred
and
knew
all
about
it
thought
i
could
but
find
the
giant
cruel
heart
would
i
give
it
a
squeeze
the
giant
and
giantess
went
on
talking
for
a
long
time
the
giantess
kept
advising
the
giant
to
hide
his
heart
somewhere
in
the
house
but
he
seemed
afraid
of
the
advantage
it
would
give
her
over
him
could
hide
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
said
she
would
make
me
feel
chokey
answered
he
in
the
or
in
the
that
the
place
no
one
would
think
of
looking
for
your
heart
in
the
and
worse
cried
the
giant
the
said
she
no
it
would
grow
spongy
there
said
he
what
will
you
do
with
it
will
leave
it
a
month
longer
where
it
is
and
then
i
will
give
it
to
the
queen
of
the
kangaroos
and
she
will
carry
it
in
her
pouch
for
me
it
is
best
to
change
you
know
and
then
my
enemies
ca
find
it
but
dear
doodlem
it
a
fretting
care
to
have
a
heart
of
one
own
to
look
after
the
responsibility
is
too
much
for
me
if
it
were
not
for
a
bite
of
a
radish
now
and
then
i
never
could
bear
it
here
the
giant
looked
lovingly
towards
the
row
of
little
boys
by
the
fire
all
of
whom
were
nodding
or
asleep
on
the
floor
do
you
trust
it
to
me
dear
thunderthump
said
his
wife
would
take
the
best
possible
care
of
it
do
doubt
it
my
love
but
the
responsibility
would
be
too
much
for
you
you
would
no
longer
be
my
darling
airy
laughing
doodlem
it
would
transform
you
into
a
heavy
oppressed
woman
weary
of
life
as
i
am
the
giant
closed
his
eyes
and
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
his
wife
got
his
stockings
and
went
on
with
her
darning
soon
the
giant
pretence
became
reality
and
the
giantess
began
to
nod
over
her
work
buffy
whispered
our
time
i
think
moonlight
and
we
had
better
be
off
there
a
door
with
a
hole
for
the
cat
just
behind
us
right
said
bob
ready
so
they
got
out
of
the
and
crept
to
the
door
but
to
their
great
disappointment
when
they
got
through
it
they
found
themselves
in
a
sort
of
shed
it
was
full
of
tubs
and
things
and
though
it
was
built
of
wood
only
they
could
not
find
a
crack
us
try
this
hole
said
tricksey
for
the
giant
and
giantess
were
sleeping
behind
them
and
they
dared
not
go
back
right
said
bob
he
seldom
said
anything
else
than
now
this
hole
was
in
a
mound
that
came
in
through
the
wall
of
the
shed
and
went
along
the
floor
for
some
distance
they
crawled
into
it
and
found
it
very
dark
but
groping
their
way
along
they
soon
came
to
a
small
crack
through
which
they
saw
grass
pale
in
the
moonshine
as
they
crept
on
they
found
the
hole
began
to
get
wider
and
lead
upwards
is
that
noise
of
rushing
said
ca
tell
replied
tricksey
you
see
i
do
know
what
we
are
in
the
fact
was
they
were
creeping
along
a
channel
in
the
heart
of
a
giant
tree
and
the
noise
they
heard
was
the
noise
of
the
sap
rushing
along
in
its
wooden
pipes
when
they
laid
their
ears
to
the
wall
they
heard
it
gurgling
along
with
a
pleasant
noise
sounds
kind
and
good
said
tricksey
is
water
running
now
it
must
be
running
from
somewhere
to
somewhere
i
think
we
had
better
go
on
and
we
shall
come
somewhere
it
was
now
rather
difficult
to
go
on
for
they
had
to
climb
as
if
they
were
climbing
a
hill
and
now
the
passage
was
wide
nearly
worn
out
they
saw
light
overhead
at
last
and
creeping
through
a
crack
into
the
open
air
found
themselves
on
the
fork
of
a
huge
tree
a
great
broad
uneven
space
lay
around
them
out
of
which
spread
boughs
in
every
direction
the
smallest
of
them
as
big
as
the
biggest
tree
in
the
country
of
common
people
overhead
were
leaves
enough
to
supply
all
the
trees
they
had
ever
seen
not
much
moonlight
could
come
through
but
the
leaves
would
glimmer
white
in
the
wind
at
times
the
tree
was
full
of
giant
birds
every
now
and
then
one
would
sweep
through
with
a
great
noise
but
except
an
occasional
chirp
sounding
like
a
shrill
pipe
in
a
great
organ
they
made
no
noise
all
at
once
an
owl
began
to
hoot
he
thought
he
was
singing
as
soon
as
he
began
other
birds
replied
making
rare
game
of
him
to
their
astonishment
the
children
found
they
could
understand
every
word
they
sang
and
what
they
said
was
something
like
this
will
sing
a
song
i
the
owl
a
song
you
ugly
fowl
what
will
you
sing
about
now
the
light
is
out
about
the
night
i
the
owl
could
not
see
for
the
light
stupid
fowl
the
moon
and
the
dew
and
the
shadows
the
owl
spread
out
his
silent
soft
sly
wings
and
lighting
between
and
nearly
smothered
them
closing
up
one
under
each
wing
it
was
like
being
buried
in
a
down
bed
but
the
owl
did
not
like
anything
between
his
sides
and
his
wings
so
he
opened
his
wings
again
and
the
children
made
haste
to
get
out
immediately
went
in
front
of
the
bird
and
looking
up
into
his
huge
face
which
was
as
round
as
the
eyes
of
the
giantess
spectacles
and
much
bigger
dropped
a
pretty
courtesy
and
said
owl
i
want
to
whisper
to
you
well
small
child
answered
the
owl
looking
important
and
stooping
his
ear
towards
her
is
it
tell
me
where
the
eagle
lives
that
sits
on
the
giant
heart
you
naughty
child
that
a
secret
for
shame
and
with
a
great
hiss
that
terrified
them
the
owl
flew
into
the
tree
all
birds
are
fond
of
secrets
but
not
many
of
them
can
keep
them
so
well
as
the
owl
so
the
children
went
on
because
they
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
they
found
the
way
very
rough
and
difficult
the
tree
was
so
full
of
humps
and
hollows
now
and
then
they
plashed
into
a
pool
of
rain
now
and
then
they
came
upon
twigs
growing
out
of
the
trunk
where
they
had
no
business
and
they
were
as
large
as
poplars
sometimes
they
came
upon
great
cushions
of
soft
moss
and
on
one
of
them
they
lay
down
and
rested
but
they
had
not
lain
long
before
they
spied
a
large
nightingale
sitting
on
a
branch
with
its
bright
eyes
looking
up
at
the
moon
in
a
moment
more
he
began
to
sing
and
the
birds
about
him
began
to
reply
but
in
a
very
different
tone
from
that
in
which
they
had
replied
to
the
owl
oh
the
birds
did
call
the
nightingale
such
pretty
names
the
nightingale
sang
and
the
birds
replied
like
this
i
will
sing
a
song
i
the
nightingale
a
song
long
long
little
neverfail
what
will
you
sing
about
light
in
or
light
out
about
the
light
gone
away
down
away
and
out
of
sight
poor
lost
day
mourning
for
the
day
dead
his
dim
bed
the
nightingale
sang
so
sweetly
that
the
children
would
have
fallen
asleep
but
for
fear
of
losing
any
of
the
song
when
the
nightingale
stopped
they
got
up
and
wandered
on
they
did
not
know
where
they
were
going
but
they
thought
it
best
to
keep
going
on
because
then
they
might
come
upon
something
or
other
they
were
very
sorry
they
forgot
to
ask
the
nightingale
about
the
eagle
nest
but
his
music
had
put
everything
else
out
of
their
heads
they
resolved
however
not
to
forget
the
next
time
they
had
a
chance
they
went
on
and
on
till
they
were
both
tired
and
said
at
last
trying
to
laugh
declare
my
legs
feel
just
like
a
dutch
doll
here
the
place
to
go
to
bed
in
said
they
stood
at
the
edge
of
a
last
year
nest
and
looked
down
with
delight
into
the
round
mossy
cave
then
they
crept
gently
in
and
lying
down
in
each
other
arms
found
it
so
deep
and
warm
and
comfortable
and
soft
that
they
were
soon
fast
asleep
now
close
beside
them
in
a
hollow
was
another
nest
in
which
lay
a
lark
and
his
wife
and
the
children
were
awakened
very
early
in
the
morning
by
a
dispute
between
and
lark
me
up
said
the
lark
is
not
time
said
the
lark
wife
is
said
the
lark
rather
rudely
darkness
is
quite
thin
i
can
almost
see
my
own
beak
said
the
lark
wife
know
you
came
home
yesterday
morning
quite
worn
out
you
had
to
fly
so
very
high
before
you
saw
him
i
am
sure
he
would
not
mind
if
you
took
it
a
little
easier
do
be
quiet
and
go
to
sleep
again
not
it
at
all
said
the
lark
does
want
me
i
want
him
let
me
up
i
say
he
began
to
sing
and
and
having
now
learned
the
way
answered
him
will
sing
a
song
i
the
lark
sing
little
what
will
you
sing
about
now
the
night
is
out
can
only
call
i
ca
think
let
me
up
that
all
let
me
drink
thirsting
all
the
long
night
for
a
drink
of
light
by
this
time
the
lark
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
his
nest
and
looking
at
the
children
little
things
you
ca
fly
said
the
lark
but
we
can
look
up
said
tricksey
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
see
the
very
first
of
the
sun
we
know
what
it
is
to
wait
till
he
comes
he
no
worse
for
your
seeing
him
first
is
he
no
certainly
not
answered
the
lark
with
condescension
and
then
bursting
into
his
he
sprung
aloft
clapping
his
wings
like
a
clock
running
down
us
where
began
but
the
lark
was
out
of
sight
his
song
was
all
that
was
left
of
him
that
was
everywhere
and
he
was
nowhere
bird
said
buffy
all
very
well
for
larks
to
go
hunting
the
sun
but
they
have
no
business
to
despise
their
neighbours
for
all
that
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
said
a
sweet
out
of
the
nest
this
was
the
lark
wife
who
staid
at
home
with
the
young
larks
while
her
husband
went
to
church
thank
you
if
you
please
answered
and
up
popped
a
pretty
brown
head
and
then
up
came
a
brown
feathery
body
and
last
of
all
came
the
slender
legs
on
to
the
edge
of
the
nest
there
she
turned
and
looking
down
into
the
nest
from
which
came
a
whole
litany
of
chirpings
for
breakfast
said
still
little
ones
then
she
turned
to
the
children
husband
is
king
of
the
larks
she
said
took
off
his
cap
and
courtesied
very
low
it
not
me
said
the
bird
looking
very
shy
am
only
his
wife
it
my
husband
she
looked
up
after
him
into
the
sky
whence
his
song
was
still
falling
like
a
shower
of
musical
hailstones
perhaps
she
could
see
him
a
splendid
bird
said
you
know
he
get
up
a
little
too
early
no
he
does
it
only
his
way
you
know
but
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
us
please
lady
lark
where
the
lives
that
sits
on
giant
thunderthump
heart
that
is
a
secret
you
promise
not
to
tell
but
larks
ought
to
be
discreet
they
see
more
than
other
birds
you
do
fly
up
high
like
your
husband
do
you
often
but
it
no
matter
i
come
to
know
things
for
all
that
tell
me
and
i
will
sing
you
a
song
said
you
sing
too
and
i
will
sing
you
a
song
i
learned
the
other
day
about
a
lark
and
his
wife
do
said
the
lark
wife
quiet
children
and
listen
was
very
glad
she
happened
to
know
a
song
which
would
please
the
lark
wife
at
least
whatever
the
lark
himself
might
have
thought
of
it
if
he
had
heard
it
so
she
sang
morrow
my
lord
in
the
sky
alone
sang
the
lark
as
the
sun
ascended
his
throne
on
me
my
lord
i
only
am
come
of
all
your
servants
to
welcome
you
home
i
have
flown
for
an
hour
right
up
i
swear
to
catch
the
first
shine
of
your
golden
hair
i
thank
you
then
said
the
king
lark
for
flying
so
high
and
hating
the
dark
you
ask
a
full
cup
for
half
a
thirst
half
is
love
of
me
and
half
love
to
be
first
there
many
a
bird
that
makes
no
haste
but
waits
till
i
come
that
as
much
to
my
taste
and
the
king
hid
his
head
in
a
turban
of
cloud
and
the
lark
stopped
singing
quite
vexed
and
cowed
but
he
flew
up
higher
and
thought
the
wrath
of
the
king
will
be
over
and
gone
and
his
crown
shining
out
of
the
cloudy
fold
will
change
my
brown
feathers
to
a
glory
of
gold
so
he
flew
with
the
strength
of
a
lark
he
flew
but
as
he
rose
the
cloud
rose
too
and
not
a
gleam
of
the
golden
hair
came
through
the
depth
of
the
misty
air
till
weary
with
flying
with
sighing
sore
the
strong
could
do
no
more
his
wings
had
had
no
chrism
of
gold
and
his
feathers
felt
withered
and
worn
and
old
and
he
sank
and
quivered
and
dropped
like
a
stone
and
there
on
his
nest
where
he
left
her
alone
sat
his
little
wife
on
her
little
eggs
keeping
them
warm
with
wings
and
legs
did
i
say
alone
ah
no
such
thing
full
in
her
face
was
shining
the
king
sir
lark
you
look
tired
said
he
is
not
always
the
best
way
to
me
while
you
have
been
singing
so
high
and
away
i
been
shining
to
your
little
wife
all
day
he
had
set
his
crown
all
about
the
nest
and
out
of
the
midst
shone
her
little
brown
breast
and
so
glorious
was
she
in
russet
gold
that
for
wonder
and
awe
sir
lark
grew
cold
he
popped
his
head
under
her
wing
and
lay
as
still
as
a
stone
till
the
king
was
away
as
soon
as
had
finished
her
song
the
lark
wife
began
a
low
sweet
modest
little
song
of
her
own
and
after
she
had
piped
away
for
two
or
three
minutes
she
said
dear
children
what
can
i
do
for
you
us
where
the
lives
please
said
i
do
think
there
can
be
much
harm
in
telling
such
wise
good
children
said
lady
lark
am
sure
you
do
want
to
do
any
mischief
no
quite
the
contrary
said
i
tell
you
she
lives
on
the
very
topmost
peak
of
mount
skycrack
and
the
only
way
to
get
up
is
to
climb
on
the
spiders
webs
that
cover
it
from
top
to
bottom
rather
serious
said
you
do
want
to
go
up
you
foolish
little
thing
you
ca
go
and
what
do
you
want
to
go
up
for
is
a
secret
said
it
no
business
of
mine
rejoined
lady
lark
a
little
offended
and
quite
vexed
that
she
had
told
them
so
she
flew
away
to
find
some
breakfast
for
her
little
ones
who
by
this
time
were
chirping
very
impatiently
the
children
looked
at
each
other
joined
hands
and
walked
off
in
a
minute
more
the
sun
was
up
and
they
soon
reached
the
outside
of
the
tree
the
bark
was
so
knobby
and
rough
and
full
of
twigs
that
they
managed
to
get
down
though
not
without
great
difficulty
then
far
away
to
the
north
they
saw
a
huge
peak
like
the
spire
of
a
church
going
right
up
into
the
sky
they
thought
this
must
be
mount
skycrack
and
turned
their
faces
towards
it
as
they
went
on
they
saw
a
giant
or
two
now
and
then
striding
about
the
fields
or
through
the
woods
but
they
kept
out
of
their
way
nor
were
they
in
much
danger
for
it
was
only
one
or
two
of
the
border
giants
that
were
so
very
fond
of
children
at
last
they
came
to
the
foot
of
mount
skycrack
it
stood
in
a
plain
alone
and
shot
right
up
i
do
know
how
many
thousand
feet
into
the
air
a
long
narrow
spearlike
mountain
the
whole
face
of
it
from
top
to
bottom
was
covered
with
a
network
of
spiders
webs
with
threads
of
various
sizes
from
that
of
silk
to
that
of
whipcord
the
webs
shook
and
quivered
and
waved
in
the
sun
glittering
like
silver
all
about
ran
huge
greedy
spiders
catching
huge
silly
flies
and
devouring
them
here
they
sat
down
to
consider
what
could
be
done
the
spiders
did
not
heed
them
but
ate
away
at
the
flies
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
all
round
it
was
a
ring
of
water
not
very
broad
but
very
deep
now
as
they
sat
watching
one
of
the
spiders
whose
web
was
woven
across
this
water
somehow
or
other
lost
his
hold
and
fell
on
his
back
and
ran
to
his
assistance
and
laying
hold
each
of
one
of
his
legs
succeeded
with
the
help
of
the
other
legs
which
struggled
spiderfully
in
getting
him
out
upon
dry
land
as
soon
as
he
had
shaken
himself
and
dried
himself
a
little
the
spider
turned
to
the
children
saying
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
us
please
said
they
we
can
get
up
the
mountain
to
the
nest
is
easier
answered
the
spider
run
up
there
and
tell
them
all
i
sent
you
and
nobody
will
mind
you
we
have
got
claws
like
you
spider
said
buffy
no
more
you
have
poor
unprovided
creatures
still
i
think
we
can
manage
it
come
home
with
me
wo
eat
us
will
you
said
buffy
dear
child
answered
the
spider
in
a
tone
of
injured
dignity
eat
nothing
but
what
is
mischievous
or
useless
you
have
helped
me
and
now
i
will
help
you
the
children
rose
at
once
and
climbing
as
well
as
they
could
reached
the
spider
nest
in
the
centre
of
the
web
they
did
not
find
it
very
difficult
for
whenever
too
great
a
gap
came
the
spider
spinning
a
strong
cord
stretched
it
just
where
they
would
have
chosen
to
put
their
feet
next
he
left
them
in
his
nest
after
bringing
them
two
enormous
taken
from
bees
that
he
had
caught
presently
about
six
of
the
wisest
of
the
spiders
came
back
with
him
it
was
rather
horrible
to
look
up
and
see
them
all
round
the
mouth
of
the
nest
looking
down
on
them
in
contemplation
as
if
wondering
whether
they
would
be
nice
eating
at
length
one
of
them
said
us
truly
what
you
want
with
the
eagle
and
we
will
try
to
help
you
then
told
them
that
there
was
a
giant
on
the
borders
who
treated
little
children
no
better
than
radishes
and
that
they
had
narrowly
escaped
being
eaten
by
him
that
they
had
found
out
that
the
great
of
mount
skycrack
was
at
present
sitting
on
his
heart
and
that
if
they
could
only
get
hold
of
the
heart
they
would
soon
teach
the
giant
better
behaviour
said
their
host
you
get
at
the
heart
of
the
giant
you
will
find
it
as
large
as
one
of
your
elephants
what
can
you
do
with
it
least
scratch
will
kill
it
answered
but
you
might
do
better
than
that
said
the
we
have
resolved
to
help
you
here
is
a
little
bag
of
the
giants
can
not
bear
spiders
and
this
juice
is
dreadful
poison
to
them
we
are
all
ready
to
go
up
with
you
and
drive
the
eagle
away
then
you
must
put
the
heart
into
this
other
bag
and
bring
it
down
with
you
for
then
the
giant
will
be
in
your
power
how
can
we
do
that
said
buffy
bag
is
not
much
bigger
than
a
it
is
as
large
as
you
will
find
convenient
to
carry
but
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
heart
it
into
the
bag
to
be
sure
only
first
you
must
squeeze
a
drop
out
of
the
other
bag
upon
it
you
will
see
what
will
happen
well
we
will
said
now
if
you
please
how
shall
we
go
that
our
business
said
the
first
spider
come
with
me
and
my
grandfather
will
take
your
brother
get
up
so
mounted
on
the
narrow
part
of
the
spider
back
and
held
fast
and
got
on
the
grandfather
back
and
up
they
scrambled
over
one
web
after
another
up
and
up
and
every
spider
followed
so
that
when
looked
back
she
saw
a
whole
army
of
spiders
scrambling
after
them
can
we
want
with
so
many
she
thought
but
she
said
nothing
the
moon
was
now
up
and
it
was
a
splendid
sight
below
and
around
them
all
giantland
was
spread
out
under
them
with
its
great
hills
lakes
trees
and
animals
and
all
above
them
was
the
clear
heaven
and
mount
skycrack
rising
into
it
with
its
endless
ladders
of
spiderwebs
glittering
like
cords
made
of
moonbeams
and
up
the
moonbeams
went
crawling
and
scrambling
and
racing
a
huge
army
of
huge
spiders
at
length
they
reached
all
but
the
very
summit
where
they
stopped
and
could
see
above
them
a
great
globe
of
feathers
that
finished
off
the
mountain
like
an
ornamental
knob
shall
we
drive
her
off
said
buffy
soon
manage
that
said
the
grandfather
spider
on
you
down
there
up
rushed
the
whole
army
past
the
children
over
the
edge
of
the
nest
on
to
the
and
buried
themselves
in
her
feathers
in
a
moment
she
became
very
restless
and
went
picking
about
with
her
beak
all
at
once
she
spread
out
her
wings
with
a
sound
like
a
whirlwind
and
flew
off
to
bathe
in
the
sea
and
then
the
spiders
began
to
drop
from
her
in
all
directions
on
their
gossamer
wings
the
children
had
to
hold
fast
to
keep
the
wind
of
the
eagle
flight
from
blowing
them
off
as
soon
as
it
was
over
they
looked
into
the
nest
and
there
lay
the
giant
heart
an
awful
and
ugly
thing
haste
child
said
tricksey
spider
so
tricksey
took
her
bag
and
squeezed
a
drop
out
of
it
upon
the
heart
she
thought
she
heard
the
giant
give
a
roar
of
pain
and
she
nearly
fell
from
her
seat
with
terror
the
heart
instantly
began
to
shrink
it
shrunk
and
shrivelled
till
it
was
nearly
gone
and
caught
it
up
and
put
it
into
the
bag
then
the
two
spiders
turned
and
went
down
again
as
fast
as
they
could
before
they
got
to
the
bottom
they
heard
the
shrieks
of
the
over
the
loss
of
her
egg
but
the
spiders
told
them
not
to
be
alarmed
for
her
eyes
were
too
big
to
see
them
by
the
time
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
all
the
spiders
had
got
home
and
were
busy
again
catching
flies
as
if
nothing
had
happened
so
the
children
after
renewed
thanks
to
their
friends
set
off
carrying
the
giant
heart
with
them
you
should
find
it
at
all
troublesome
just
give
it
a
little
more
directly
said
the
grandfather
as
they
took
their
leave
now
the
giant
had
given
an
awful
roar
of
pain
the
moment
they
anointed
his
heart
and
had
fallen
down
in
a
fit
in
which
he
lay
so
long
that
all
the
boys
might
have
escaped
if
they
had
not
been
so
fat
one
did
and
got
home
in
safety
for
days
the
giant
was
unable
to
speak
the
first
words
he
uttered
were
my
heart
my
heart
heart
is
safe
enough
dear
thunderthump
said
his
wife
a
man
of
your
size
ought
not
to
be
so
nervous
and
apprehensive
i
am
ashamed
of
you
have
no
heart
doodlem
answered
he
assure
you
that
this
moment
mine
is
in
the
greatest
danger
it
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
foes
though
who
they
are
i
can
not
tell
here
he
fainted
again
for
finding
the
heart
begin
to
swell
a
little
had
given
it
the
least
touch
of
again
he
recovered
and
said
doodlem
my
heart
is
coming
back
to
me
it
is
coming
nearer
and
nearer
after
lying
silent
for
a
few
hours
he
exclaimed
is
in
the
house
i
know
and
he
jumped
up
and
walked
about
looking
in
every
corner
just
then
and
came
out
of
the
hole
in
the
and
through
the
in
the
door
and
walked
boldly
towards
the
giant
both
kept
their
eyes
busy
watching
him
led
by
the
love
of
his
own
heart
the
giant
soon
spied
them
and
staggered
furiously
towards
them
will
eat
you
you
vermin
he
cried
me
my
heart
tricksey
gave
the
heart
a
sharp
pinch
when
down
fell
the
giant
on
his
knees
blubbering
and
crying
and
begging
for
his
heart
shall
have
it
if
you
behave
yourself
properly
said
tricksey
do
you
want
me
to
do
asked
he
whimpering
take
all
those
boys
and
girls
and
carry
them
home
at
once
not
able
i
too
them
up
directly
ca
till
you
give
me
my
heart
well
said
tricksey
and
she
gave
the
heart
another
pinch
the
giant
jumped
to
his
feet
and
catching
up
all
the
children
thrust
some
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
some
into
his
put
two
or
three
into
his
hat
and
took
a
bundle
of
them
under
each
arm
then
he
staggered
to
the
door
all
this
time
poor
doodlem
was
sitting
in
her
armchair
crying
and
mending
a
white
stocking
the
giant
led
the
way
to
the
borders
he
could
not
go
fast
so
that
buffy
and
tricksey
managed
to
keep
up
with
him
when
they
reached
the
borders
they
thought
it
would
be
safer
to
let
the
children
find
their
own
way
home
so
they
told
him
to
set
them
down
he
obeyed
you
put
them
all
down
mr
thunderthump
asked
said
the
giant
a
lie
squeaked
a
little
voice
and
out
came
a
head
from
his
pinched
the
heart
till
the
giant
roared
with
pain
not
a
gentleman
you
tell
stories
she
said
was
the
thinnest
of
the
lot
said
thunderthump
crying
you
all
there
now
children
asked
tricksey
said
they
after
counting
themselves
very
carefully
and
with
some
difficulty
for
they
were
all
stupid
children
said
to
the
giant
you
promise
to
carry
off
no
more
children
and
never
to
eat
a
child
again
all
you
life
yes
i
promise
answered
thunderthump
sobbing
you
will
never
cross
the
borders
of
giantland
you
shall
never
again
wear
white
stockings
on
a
sunday
all
your
life
do
you
promise
the
giant
hesitated
at
this
and
began
to
expostulate
but
believing
it
would
be
good
for
his
morals
insisted
and
the
giant
promised
then
she
required
of
him
that
when
she
gave
him
back
his
heart
he
should
give
it
to
his
wife
to
take
care
of
for
him
for
ever
after
the
poor
giant
feel
on
his
knees
and
began
again
to
beg
but
giving
the
heart
a
slight
pinch
he
bawled
out
yes
doodlem
shall
have
it
i
swear
only
she
must
not
put
it
in
the
or
in
the
not
make
your
own
bargain
with
and
you
promise
not
to
interfere
with
my
brother
and
me
or
to
take
any
revenge
for
what
we
have
done
yes
my
dear
children
i
promise
everything
do
pray
make
haste
and
give
me
back
my
poor
heart
there
then
till
i
bring
it
to
you
yes
only
make
haste
for
i
feel
very
faint
began
to
undo
the
mouth
of
the
bag
but
who
had
got
very
knowing
on
his
travels
took
out
his
knife
with
the
pretence
of
cutting
the
string
but
in
reality
to
be
prepared
for
any
emergency
no
sooner
was
the
heart
out
of
the
bag
than
it
expanded
to
the
size
of
a
bullock
and
the
giant
with
a
yell
of
rage
and
vengeance
rushed
on
the
two
children
who
had
stepped
sideways
from
the
terrible
heart
but
was
too
quick
for
thunderthump
he
sprang
to
the
heart
and
buried
his
knife
in
it
up
to
the
hilt
a
fountain
of
blood
spouted
from
it
and
with
a
dreadful
groan
the
giant
fell
dead
at
the
feet
of
little
who
could
not
help
being
sorry
for
him
after
all
silly
thing
said
a
little
wisehead
what
a
horrid
story
said
one
small
girl
with
great
eyes
who
sat
staring
into
the
fire
i
do
think
it
at
all
a
nice
story
for
supper
with
those
horrid
spiders
too
said
an
older
girl
well
let
us
have
a
game
and
forget
it
i
said
no
that
we
sha
i
am
sure
said
one
i
will
tell
our
amy
wo
it
be
fun
she
scream
said
another
i
tell
her
all
the
more
no
no
you
must
be
unkind
said
i
else
you
will
never
help
little
children
against
wicked
giants
the
giants
will
eat
you
too
then
oh
i
know
what
you
mean
you
ca
frighten
me
this
was
said
by
one
of
the
elder
girls
who
promised
fair
to
reach
before
long
the
summit
of
uncompromising
womanhood
she
made
me
feel
very
small
with
my
moralizing
so
i
dropt
it
on
the
whole
i
was
rather
disappointed
with
the
effect
of
my
story
perhaps
the
disappointment
was
no
more
than
i
deserved
but
i
did
not
like
to
think
i
had
failed
with
children
nor
did
i
think
so
any
longer
after
a
darling
little
girl
who
had
sat
next
me
at
tea
came
to
me
to
say
good
night
and
reaching
up
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
and
then
whispered
very
gently
thank
you
dear
smith
i
will
be
good
it
was
a
very
nice
story
if
i
was
a
man
i
would
kill
all
the
wicked
people
in
the
world
but
i
am
only
a
little
girl
you
know
so
i
can
only
be
good
the
darling
did
not
know
how
much
more
one
good
woman
can
do
to
kill
evil
than
all
the
swords
of
the
world
in
the
hands
of
righteous
heroes
chapter
iii
a
child
holiday
when
the
next
evening
of
our
assembly
came
i
could
see
on
adela
face
a
look
of
subdued
expectation
and
i
knew
now
to
what
to
attribute
it
harry
was
going
to
read
there
was
a
restlessness
in
her
eyelids
they
were
always
rising
and
falling
as
suddenly
but
when
the
time
drew
near
they
grew
more
still
only
her
colour
went
and
came
a
little
by
the
time
we
were
all
seated
she
was
as
quiet
as
death
harry
pulled
out
a
manuscript
have
you
any
objection
to
a
he
asked
of
the
company
generally
certainly
not
was
the
common
reply
though
ralph
stared
a
little
and
his
wife
looked
at
him
i
believe
the
reason
was
that
they
had
never
known
harry
write
poetry
before
but
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
the
title
two
you
young
rascal
cried
his
brother
am
i
to
keep
you
in
material
for
ever
are
you
going
to
pluck
my
wings
till
they
are
as
bare
as
an
egg
really
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
continued
in
pretended
anger
while
harry
was
keeping
down
a
laugh
of
keen
enjoyment
it
is
too
bad
of
that
scapegrace
brother
of
mine
of
course
you
are
all
welcome
to
anything
i
have
got
but
he
has
no
right
to
escape
from
his
responsibilities
on
that
account
it
is
rude
to
us
all
i
know
he
can
write
if
he
likes
why
ralph
you
would
be
glad
of
such
a
brother
to
steal
your
sermons
from
if
you
had
been
up
all
night
as
i
was
of
course
i
did
not
mean
to
claim
any
more
credit
than
that
of
unearthing
some
of
your
shy
may
i
read
them
or
not
oh
of
course
but
it
is
lucky
i
came
prepared
for
some
escapade
of
the
sort
and
brought
a
manuscript
of
proper
weight
and
length
in
my
pocket
suddenly
harry
face
changed
from
a
laughing
to
a
grave
one
i
saw
how
it
was
he
had
glanced
at
adela
and
her
look
of
unmistakeable
disappointment
was
reflected
in
his
face
but
there
was
a
glimmer
of
pleasure
in
his
eyes
notwithstanding
and
i
fancied
i
could
see
that
the
pleasure
would
have
been
more
marked
had
he
not
feared
that
he
had
placed
himself
at
a
disadvantage
with
her
namely
that
she
would
suppose
him
incapable
of
producing
a
story
however
it
was
only
for
a
moment
that
this
change
of
feeling
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
of
some
haste
he
the
manuscript
which
he
had
rolled
up
as
if
to
protect
it
from
the
indignation
of
his
brother
and
read
the
following
ballad
the
two
i
there
was
john
gordon
and
archibold
and
an
earl
twin
sons
were
they
when
they
were
one
and
twenty
years
old
they
fell
out
on
their
said
archibold
sly
turn
now
false
and
fell
or
down
thou
goest
as
black
as
a
lie
to
the
father
of
lies
in
hell
this
to
me
brother
archie
i
pray
what
ill
have
i
done
to
thee
hound
thou
shall
rue
the
day
thou
gettest
an
answer
of
me
mine
will
be
louder
than
lady
janet
and
spoken
in
broad
daylight
and
the
wall
to
scale
is
my
iron
mail
not
her
castle
wall
at
night
clomb
the
wall
of
her
castle
tall
in
the
moon
and
the
roaring
wind
it
was
dark
and
still
in
her
bower
until
the
morning
looked
in
behind
therefore
john
gordon
false
brother
for
either
thou
or
i
on
a
hard
wet
bed
wet
cold
and
red
for
evermore
shall
lie
archibold
janet
is
my
true
love
would
i
had
told
it
thee
hate
thee
the
worse
turn
or
i
curse
the
night
that
got
thee
and
me
their
swords
they
drew
and
the
sparks
they
flew
as
if
hammers
did
anvils
beat
and
the
red
blood
ran
till
the
ground
began
to
plash
beneath
their
feet
archie
thou
hast
given
me
a
cold
supper
a
supper
of
steel
i
trow
but
reach
me
one
grasp
of
a
brother
hand
and
turn
me
before
you
go
but
he
turned
himself
on
his
heel
and
away
with
a
speechless
frown
and
up
in
the
oak
with
a
greedy
croak
the
claimed
his
own
ii
the
sun
looked
over
a
cloud
of
gold
lady
margaret
looked
over
the
wall
over
the
bridge
rode
archibold
behind
him
his
merry
men
all
he
leads
his
band
to
the
holy
land
they
follow
with
merry
din
a
white
christ
cross
is
on
his
back
in
his
breast
a
darksome
sin
and
the
white
cross
burned
him
like
the
fire
that
he
could
nor
eat
nor
rest
it
burned
in
and
in
to
get
at
the
sin
that
lay
cowering
in
his
breast
a
mile
from
the
shore
of
the
dead
sea
the
army
lay
one
night
lord
archibold
rose
and
out
he
goes
walking
in
the
moonlight
he
came
to
the
shore
of
the
old
salt
sea
yellow
sands
with
tinge
the
bones
of
the
dead
on
the
edge
of
its
bed
lay
lapped
in
its
oozy
fringe
he
sat
him
down
on
a
stone
and
he
sighed
so
dreary
and
deep
devil
may
take
my
soul
when
i
wake
if
he
only
let
me
sleep
out
from
the
bones
and
the
slime
and
the
stones
came
a
voice
like
a
raven
croak
it
thou
lord
archibold
gordon
it
said
it
thou
those
words
that
spoke
say
them
again
quoth
archibold
thou
ghost
or
fiend
of
the
deep
archibold
heed
how
thou
speed
if
thou
sell
me
thy
soul
for
sleep
lord
archibold
laughed
with
a
loud
ha
the
dead
sea
curdled
to
hear
have
the
worst
of
the
bargain
curst
it
has
every
fault
but
fear
lord
archibold
belzebub
done
his
laugh
came
back
in
a
moan
the
salt
glittered
on
and
the
white
moon
shone
and
lord
archibold
was
alone
and
back
he
went
to
his
glimmering
tent
and
down
in
his
cloak
he
lay
and
sound
he
slept
and
a
man
watched
by
his
bed
till
day
and
if
ever
he
turned
or
moaned
in
his
sleep
or
his
brow
began
to
lower
oh
gentle
and
clear
in
the
sleeper
ear
he
would
whisper
words
of
power
till
his
lips
would
quiver
and
sighs
of
bliss
from
sorrow
bosom
would
break
and
the
tear
soft
and
slow
would
gather
and
flow
and
yet
he
would
not
wake
every
night
the
man
sat
by
his
bed
i
say
and
in
mail
with
his
visor
down
rode
beside
him
in
but
well
i
wot
that
it
was
not
the
devil
that
took
his
part
but
his
john
he
thought
dead
and
gone
who
followed
to
ease
his
heart
iii
home
came
lord
archibold
weary
wight
home
to
his
own
countree
and
he
cried
when
his
castle
came
in
sight
christ
me
save
and
see
and
the
man
in
with
his
visor
down
had
gone
he
knew
not
where
and
he
lighted
down
and
into
the
hall
and
his
mother
met
him
there
but
dull
was
her
eye
though
her
mien
was
high
and
she
spoke
like
eve
to
cain
archibold
gordon
answer
me
true
or
i
never
speak
again
is
thy
brother
lord
archibold
he
was
flesh
and
blood
of
thine
has
thy
brother
keeper
laid
him
cold
where
the
warm
sun
can
not
shine
lord
archibold
could
not
speak
a
word
for
his
heart
was
almost
broke
he
turned
to
go
the
at
the
window
gave
a
croak
where
art
thou
going
lord
archie
she
said
thy
lips
so
white
and
thin
i
am
going
to
lie
in
the
earth
with
my
lady
margaret
sank
on
her
couch
i
shall
lose
them
both
lord
archibold
strode
along
the
road
to
the
field
of
the
brothers
fray
he
came
to
the
spot
where
they
had
fought
god
he
cried
in
fright
have
left
him
there
till
his
bones
are
bare
through
the
plates
they
glimmer
white
for
his
brother
armour
lay
there
dank
and
worn
with
frost
and
dew
had
the
long
long
grass
that
grew
so
rank
grown
the
very
armour
through
brother
brother
cried
the
earl
with
a
loud
wail
would
put
my
soul
into
thy
bones
to
see
thee
alive
and
hale
ha
said
a
voice
from
out
the
helm
was
the
voice
of
the
dead
sea
shore
and
the
joints
did
close
and
the
armour
rose
and
clattered
and
grass
uptore
canst
put
no
soul
into
his
bones
thy
brother
alive
to
set
for
the
sleep
was
thine
and
thy
soul
is
mine
and
lord
archibold
words
to
that
said
the
fearless
earl
sleep
was
none
of
thine
for
i
dreamed
of
my
brother
all
the
night
his
soul
brought
the
sleep
to
mine
i
care
not
a
crack
for
a
soul
so
black
and
thou
have
it
yet
i
would
let
it
burn
to
eternity
my
brother
alive
to
set
the
demon
lifted
his
beaver
up
crusted
with
blood
and
mould
and
lo
john
gordon
looked
out
of
the
helm
and
smiled
upon
archibold
soul
is
mine
brother
archie
he
said
i
yield
it
thee
none
the
worse
no
devil
came
near
thee
archie
lad
but
a
brother
to
be
thy
nurse
lord
archibold
fell
upon
his
knee
on
the
bright
green
sod
soul
that
my
brother
gives
back
to
me
is
thine
for
ever
o
god
now
for
a
piece
of
good
honest
prose
said
the
curate
the
moment
harry
had
finished
without
allowing
room
for
any
remarks
that
is
if
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
will
allow
me
to
read
once
more
of
course
all
assented
heartily
it
is
nothing
of
a
story
but
i
think
it
is
something
of
a
picture
drawn
principally
from
experiences
of
my
own
childhood
which
i
told
you
was
spent
chiefly
in
the
north
of
scotland
the
one
great
joy
of
the
year
although
some
years
went
without
it
altogether
was
the
summer
visit
paid
to
the
shores
of
the
moray
firth
my
story
is
merely
a
record
of
some
of
the
impressions
left
on
myself
by
such
a
visit
although
the
boy
is
certainly
not
a
portrait
of
myself
and
if
it
has
no
result
no
end
reaching
beyond
childhood
into
what
is
commonly
called
life
i
presume
it
is
not
of
a
peculiar
or
solitary
character
in
that
respect
for
surely
many
that
we
count
finished
stories
must
look
very
different
to
the
angels
and
if
they
have
to
be
written
over
again
at
least
they
have
to
be
carried
on
a
few
aeons
further
a
child
holiday
before
the
door
of
a
substantial
in
the
north
of
scotland
stands
a
vehicle
of
somewhat
singular
construction
when
analysed
however
its
composition
proves
to
be
simple
enough
it
is
a
common
agricultural
cart
over
which
by
means
of
a
few
iron
rods
bent
across
a
covering
of
white
canvas
has
been
stretched
it
is
thus
transformed
from
a
hay
or
harvest
cart
into
a
family
carriage
of
comfortable
dimensions
though
somewhat
slow
of
progress
the
lack
of
springs
is
supplied
by
thick
layers
of
straw
while
sacks
stuffed
with
the
same
material
are
placed
around
for
seats
various
articles
are
being
stowed
away
under
the
bags
and
in
the
corners
among
the
straw
by
children
with
bright
expectant
faces
the
said
articles
having
been
in
process
of
collection
and
arrangement
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
previous
in
anticipation
of
the
journey
which
now
lies
in
all
its
length
and
brightness
the
length
and
brightness
of
a
long
northern
summer
day
before
them
at
last
all
their
private
mysteries
of
provisions
playthings
and
books
having
found
places
of
safety
more
or
less
accessible
on
demand
every
motion
of
the
horse
every
shake
and
rattle
of
the
covered
cart
makes
them
only
more
impatient
to
proceed
which
desire
is
at
length
gratified
by
their
moving
on
at
a
funeral
pace
through
the
open
gate
they
are
followed
by
another
cart
loaded
with
the
luggage
necessary
for
a
sojourn
at
one
of
the
fishing
villages
on
the
coast
about
twenty
miles
distant
from
their
home
their
father
and
mother
are
to
follow
in
the
gig
at
a
later
hour
in
the
day
expecting
to
overtake
them
about
on
the
through
the
neighbouring
village
they
pass
out
upon
the
lonely
highway
some
seeds
are
borne
to
the
place
of
their
destiny
by
their
own
wings
and
the
wings
of
the
wind
some
by
the
wings
of
birds
some
by
simple
gravitation
the
seed
of
my
story
namely
the
covered
cart
sent
forth
to
find
the
soil
for
its
coming
growth
is
dragged
by
a
stout
horse
to
the
and
as
it
oscillates
from
side
to
side
like
a
balloon
trying
to
walk
i
shall
say
something
of
its
internal
constitution
and
principally
of
its
germ
for
regarded
as
the
seed
of
my
story
a
pale
boy
of
thirteen
is
the
germ
of
the
cart
first
though
he
will
be
of
little
use
to
us
afterwards
comes
a
great
strong
boy
of
sixteen
who
considerably
despises
this
mode
of
locomotion
believing
himself
quite
capable
of
driving
his
mother
in
the
gig
whereas
he
is
only
destined
to
occupy
her
place
in
the
evening
and
return
with
his
father
then
comes
the
said
germ
a
boy
whom
repeated
attacks
of
illness
have
blanched
and
who
looks
as
if
the
thinness
of
its
earthly
garment
made
his
soul
tremble
with
the
proximity
of
the
ungenial
world
then
follows
a
pretty
blonde
with
smooth
hair
and
smooth
cheeks
and
bright
blue
eyes
the
embodiment
of
home
pleasures
and
love
whose
chief
enjoyment
and
earthly
destiny
indeed
so
far
as
yet
revealed
consist
in
administering
to
the
cupidities
of
her
younger
brother
a
very
ogre
of
gingerbread
men
and
silenus
of
bottled
milk
this
milk
by
the
way
is
expected
from
former
experience
to
afford
considerable
pleasure
at
the
close
of
the
journey
in
the
shape
of
one
or
two
pellets
of
butter
in
each
bottle
the
novelty
of
the
phenomenon
and
not
any
scarcity
of
the
article
constituting
the
ground
of
interest
a
baby
on
the
lap
of
a
rosy
and
the
servant
in
his
blue
sunday
coat
who
sits
outside
the
cover
on
the
edge
of
the
cart
but
looks
in
occasionally
to
show
some
attention
to
the
young
woman
complete
the
contents
of
the
vehicle
herbert
netherby
though
as
i
have
said
only
thirteen
years
of
age
had
already
attained
a
degree
of
mental
development
sufficient
for
characterization
disease
had
favoured
the
almost
unhealthy
predominance
of
the
mental
over
the
bodily
powers
of
the
child
so
that
although
the
constitution
which
at
one
time
was
supposed
to
have
entirely
given
way
had
for
the
last
few
years
been
gradually
gaining
strength
he
was
still
to
be
seen
far
oftener
walking
about
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
gaze
bent
on
the
ground
or
turned
up
to
the
clouds
than
joining
in
any
of
the
boyish
sports
of
those
of
his
own
age
a
nervous
dread
of
ridicule
would
deter
him
from
taking
his
part
even
when
for
a
moment
the
fountain
of
youthfulness
gushed
forth
and
impelled
him
to
find
rest
in
activity
so
the
impulse
would
pass
away
and
he
would
relapse
into
his
former
quiescence
but
this
partial
isolation
ministered
to
the
growth
of
a
love
of
nature
which
although
its
roots
were
coeval
with
his
being
might
not
have
so
soon
appeared
above
ground
but
for
this
lack
of
human
companionship
thus
the
boy
became
one
of
nature
favourites
and
enjoyed
more
than
a
common
share
of
her
teaching
but
he
loved
her
most
in
her
stranger
moods
the
gathering
of
a
blue
cloud
on
a
sultry
summer
afternoon
he
watched
with
intense
hope
in
expectation
of
a
and
a
windy
night
after
harvest
when
the
trees
moaned
and
tossed
their
arms
about
and
the
wind
ran
hither
and
hither
over
the
desolate
fields
of
stubble
made
the
child
heart
dance
within
him
and
sent
him
out
careering
through
the
deepening
darkness
to
meet
him
then
you
would
not
have
known
him
for
the
sedate
actionless
boy
whom
you
had
seen
in
the
morning
looking
listlessly
on
while
his
schoolfellows
played
but
of
all
his
loves
for
the
shows
of
nature
none
was
so
strong
as
his
love
for
water
common
to
childhood
with
its
mills
of
rushes
its
dams
its
bridges
its
aqueducts
only
in
herbert
it
was
more
a
quiet
delighted
contemplation
weakness
prevented
his
joining
his
companions
in
the
river
but
the
sight
of
their
motions
in
the
mystery
of
the
water
as
they
floated
in
the
clear
depth
or
glided
along
by
graceful
propulsion
gave
him
as
much
real
enjoyment
as
they
received
themselves
for
it
was
water
itself
that
delighted
him
whether
in
rest
or
motion
whether
rippling
over
many
stones
like
the
first
sounds
of
a
child
speech
mingled
with
a
strange
musical
tremble
and
cadence
which
the
heart
only
and
not
the
ear
could
detect
or
lying
in
deep
still
pools
from
the
bottom
of
which
gleamed
up
bright
green
stones
or
yet
brighter
cool
in
their
little
grotto
with
water
for
an
atmosphere
and
a
firmament
through
which
the
came
washed
of
their
burning
heat
but
undimmed
of
their
splendour
he
would
lie
for
an
hour
by
the
side
of
a
he
would
stand
gazing
into
a
muddy
pool
left
on
the
road
by
last
night
rain
once
in
such
a
pool
he
beheld
a
glory
the
sun
encircled
with
a
halo
vast
and
wide
varied
like
the
ring
of
opal
colours
seen
about
the
moon
when
she
floats
through
white
clouds
only
larger
and
brighter
than
that
looking
up
he
could
see
nothing
but
a
chaos
of
black
clouds
brilliant
towards
the
sun
the
colours
he
could
not
see
except
in
the
muddy
water
in
autumn
the
rains
would
come
down
for
days
and
the
river
grow
stormy
forget
its
clearness
and
spread
out
like
a
lake
over
the
meadows
and
that
was
delightful
indeed
but
greater
yet
was
the
delight
when
the
was
carried
away
for
then
they
had
to
cross
the
stream
in
a
boat
he
longed
for
water
where
it
could
not
be
would
fain
have
seen
it
running
through
the
grass
in
front
of
his
father
house
and
had
a
waking
vision
of
a
stream
with
wooden
shores
that
babbled
through
his
bedroom
so
it
may
be
fancied
with
what
delight
he
overheard
the
parental
decision
that
they
should
spend
some
weeks
by
the
shores
of
the
great
world
water
the
father
and
the
grave
of
rivers
after
many
vain
outlooks
and
fruitless
inquiries
of
their
driver
a
sudden
turn
in
the
road
brought
them
in
sight
of
the
sea
between
the
hills
itself
resembling
a
low
blue
hill
covered
with
white
stones
indeed
the
little
girl
only
doubted
whether
those
were
white
stones
or
sheep
scattered
all
over
it
they
lost
sight
of
it
saw
it
again
and
hailed
it
with
greater
rapture
than
at
first
the
sun
was
more
than
halfway
down
when
they
arrived
they
had
secured
a
little
cottage
almost
on
the
brow
of
the
high
shore
which
in
most
places
went
down
perpendicularly
to
the
beach
or
sands
and
in
some
right
into
deep
water
but
opposite
the
cottage
declined
with
a
sloping
grassy
descent
a
winding
track
led
down
to
the
village
which
nestled
in
a
hollow
with
steep
footpaths
radiating
from
it
in
front
of
it
lower
still
lay
the
narrow
beach
narrow
even
at
low
water
for
the
steep
rocky
shore
went
steep
and
rocky
down
into
the
abyss
a
thousand
fantastic
rocks
stood
between
land
and
water
amidst
which
at
were
many
little
rocky
arbours
with
floors
of
sunny
sand
and
three
or
four
feet
of
water
here
you
might
bathe
or
sit
on
the
ledges
with
your
feet
in
the
water
medicated
with
the
restless
glitter
and
bewilderment
of
a
sunbeam
a
promontory
curving
out
into
the
sea
on
the
right
formed
a
bay
and
natural
harbour
from
which
towards
the
setting
sun
many
were
diverging
into
the
wide
sea
as
the
children
stiff
and
weary
were
getting
out
of
the
cart
herbert
fatigue
was
soon
forgotten
in
watching
their
sails
glowing
almost
red
in
the
sunset
as
they
went
out
far
into
the
dark
hunters
of
the
deep
to
spend
the
night
on
the
waters
from
the
windows
the
children
could
not
see
the
shore
with
all
its
burst
of
beauties
struck
out
from
the
meeting
of
things
unlike
for
it
lay
far
down
and
the
brow
of
the
hill
rose
between
it
and
them
only
they
knew
that
below
the
waves
were
breaking
on
the
rocks
and
they
heard
the
gush
and
roar
filling
all
the
air
the
room
in
which
herbert
slept
was
a
little
attic
with
a
window
towards
the
sea
after
gazing
with
unutterable
delight
on
the
boundless
water
which
lay
like
a
condensed
sky
in
the
grey
light
of
the
sleeping
day
for
there
is
no
night
at
this
season
in
the
north
till
he
saw
it
even
when
his
eyelids
closed
from
weariness
he
lay
down
and
the
monotonous
lullaby
of
the
sea
mingled
with
his
dreams
next
morning
he
was
wakened
by
the
challenging
and
replying
of
the
whose
crowing
sounded
to
him
more
clear
and
musical
than
that
of
any
of
the
cocks
at
home
he
jumped
out
of
bed
it
was
a
sunny
morning
and
his
soul
felt
like
a
flake
of
sunshine
as
he
looked
out
of
his
window
on
the
radiant
sea
green
and
flashing
its
clear
surface
here
and
there
torn
by
the
wind
into
spots
of
opaque
white
so
happy
did
he
feel
that
he
might
have
been
one
who
had
slept
through
death
and
the
judgment
and
had
awaked
a
child
still
in
the
kingdom
of
god
under
the
new
heavens
and
upon
the
new
earth
after
breakfast
they
all
went
down
with
their
mother
to
the
as
they
went
the
last
of
the
boats
which
had
gone
out
the
night
before
were
returning
laden
like
bees
the
sea
had
been
bountiful
everything
shone
with
gladness
but
as
herbert
drew
nearer
he
felt
a
kind
of
dread
at
the
recklessness
of
the
waves
on
they
hurried
assailed
the
rocks
devoured
the
sands
cast
themselves
in
wild
abandonment
on
whatever
opposed
them
he
feared
at
first
to
go
near
for
they
were
unsympathizing
caring
not
for
his
love
or
his
joy
and
would
sweep
him
away
like
one
of
those
floating
they
are
such
in
their
play
thought
he
must
they
be
in
their
anger
but
ere
long
he
was
playing
with
the
sea
as
with
a
tame
tiger
chasing
the
retreating
waters
till
they
rallied
and
he
in
his
turn
had
to
flee
from
their
pursuit
wearied
at
length
he
left
his
brother
and
sister
building
castles
of
wet
sand
and
wandered
along
the
shore
everywhere
about
lay
shallow
lakes
of
salt
water
so
shallow
that
they
were
invisible
except
when
a
puff
of
wind
blew
a
thousand
ripples
into
the
sun
whereupon
they
flashed
as
if
a
precipitous
rain
of
stormy
light
had
rushed
down
upon
them
lifting
his
eyes
from
one
of
these
films
of
water
herbert
saw
on
the
opposite
side
stooping
to
pick
up
some
treasure
of
the
sea
a
little
girl
apparently
about
nine
years
of
age
when
she
raised
herself
and
saw
herbert
she
moved
slowly
away
with
a
quiet
grace
that
strangely
contrasted
with
her
tattered
garments
she
was
ragged
like
the
or
the
bunch
of
dripping
that
she
carried
in
her
hand
she
was
bare
from
foot
to
knee
and
passed
over
the
wet
sand
with
a
gleam
the
wind
had
been
at
more
trouble
with
her
hair
than
any
loving
hand
it
was
black
lusterless
and
tangled
the
sight
of
rags
was
always
enough
to
move
sympathies
and
he
wished
to
speak
to
the
little
girl
and
give
her
something
but
when
he
had
followed
her
a
short
distance
all
at
once
and
without
having
looked
round
she
began
to
glide
away
from
him
with
a
motion
dancing
and
leaping
till
a
clear
pool
in
the
hollow
of
a
tabular
rock
imbedded
in
the
sand
arrested
her
progress
here
she
stood
like
a
statue
gazing
into
its
depth
then
with
a
dart
like
a
kingfisher
plunged
half
into
it
caught
something
at
which
her
head
and
curved
neck
showed
that
she
looked
with
satisfaction
and
again
before
herbert
could
come
near
her
was
skimming
along
the
uneven
shore
he
followed
as
a
boy
follows
a
lapwing
but
she
like
the
lapwing
gradually
increased
the
distance
between
them
till
he
gave
up
the
pursuit
with
some
disappointment
and
returned
to
his
brother
and
sister
more
ambitious
than
they
he
proceeded
to
construct
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
the
moat
he
intended
to
draw
around
it
a
of
considerable
pretensions
but
the
advancing
tide
drove
him
from
his
stronghold
before
he
had
begun
to
dig
the
projected
fosse
as
they
returned
home
they
passed
a
group
of
fishermen
in
their
long
boots
and
flapped
looking
somewhat
anxiously
seaward
much
to
herbert
delight
they
predicted
a
stiff
gale
and
probably
a
storm
a
low
bank
of
cloud
had
gathered
along
the
horizon
and
the
wind
had
already
freshened
the
white
spots
were
thicker
on
the
waves
and
the
sound
of
their
trampling
on
the
shore
grew
louder
after
dinner
they
sat
at
the
window
of
their
little
parlour
looking
out
over
the
sea
which
grew
darker
and
more
sullen
ever
as
the
afternoon
declined
the
cloudy
bank
had
risen
and
walled
out
the
sun
but
a
narrow
space
of
blue
on
the
horizon
looked
like
the
rent
whence
the
wind
rushed
forth
on
the
sea
and
with
the
feet
of
its
stormy
horses
tore
up
the
blue
surface
and
scattered
the
in
clouds
as
evening
drew
on
herbert
could
keep
in
the
house
no
longer
he
wandered
away
on
the
heights
keeping
from
the
brow
of
the
cliffs
now
and
then
stooping
and
struggling
with
a
stormier
eddy
till
descending
into
a
little
hollow
he
sunk
below
the
plane
of
the
tempest
and
stood
in
the
glow
of
a
sudden
calm
hearing
the
tumult
all
round
him
but
himself
in
peace
looking
up
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
sides
of
the
hollow
with
the
sky
resting
on
them
till
turning
towards
the
sea
he
saw
at
some
distance
a
point
of
the
cliff
rising
abruptly
into
the
air
at
the
same
moment
the
sun
looked
out
from
a
crack
in
the
clouds
on
the
very
horizon
and
as
herbert
could
not
see
the
sunset
the
peculiar
radiance
illuminated
the
more
strangely
the
dark
vault
of
earth
and
cloudy
sky
suddenly
to
his
astonishment
it
was
concentrated
on
the
form
of
the
little
ragged
girl
she
stood
on
the
summit
of
the
peak
before
him
the
light
was
a
crown
not
to
her
head
only
but
to
her
whole
person
as
if
she
herself
were
the
crown
set
on
the
brows
of
the
majestic
shore
disappearing
as
suddenly
it
left
her
standing
on
the
peak
dark
and
stormy
every
tress
if
tresses
they
could
be
called
of
her
windy
hair
every
tatter
of
her
scanty
garments
seeming
individually
to
protest
wind
is
my
playmate
let
me
go
if
aphrodite
was
born
of
the
sunny
sea
this
child
was
the
offspring
of
the
windy
shore
as
if
the
mind
of
the
place
had
developed
for
itself
a
consciousness
and
this
was
its
embodiment
she
bore
a
strange
affinity
to
the
rocks
and
the
and
the
pools
and
the
wide
wild
ocean
and
herbert
would
scarcely
have
been
shocked
to
see
her
cast
herself
from
the
cliff
into
the
waves
which
now
dashed
up
its
height
by
the
time
he
had
got
out
of
the
hollow
she
had
vanished
and
where
she
had
gone
he
could
not
conjecture
he
half
feared
she
had
fallen
over
the
precipice
and
several
times
that
night
as
the
vapour
of
dreams
gathered
around
him
he
started
from
his
in
terror
at
seeing
the
little
genius
of
the
storm
fall
from
her
into
the
thundering
waves
as
its
foot
next
day
the
wind
continuing
off
the
sea
with
vapour
and
rain
the
children
were
compelled
to
remain
within
doors
and
betake
themselves
to
books
and
playthings
but
herbert
chief
resource
lay
in
watching
the
sea
and
the
low
grey
sky
between
which
was
no
distinguishable
horizon
the
wind
still
increased
and
before
the
afternoon
it
blew
a
thorough
storm
wind
and
waves
raging
together
on
the
rocky
shore
the
fishermen
had
secured
their
boats
drawing
them
up
high
on
the
land
but
what
vessels
might
be
labouring
under
the
low
misty
pall
no
one
could
tell
many
anxious
fears
were
expressed
for
some
known
to
be
at
sea
and
many
tales
of
shipwreck
were
told
that
night
in
the
cottages
the
day
was
closing
in
darkened
the
sooner
by
the
mist
when
herbert
standing
at
the
window
now
rather
weary
saw
the
little
girl
dart
past
like
a
petrel
he
snatched
up
his
cap
and
rushed
from
the
house
buttoning
his
jacket
to
defend
him
from
the
weather
the
little
fellow
though
so
quiet
among
other
boys
was
a
lover
of
the
storm
as
much
as
the
girl
was
and
would
have
preferred
its
buffeting
so
long
as
his
strength
lasted
to
the
warmest
nook
by
the
fireside
and
now
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
follow
her
as
soon
as
he
was
clear
of
the
garden
he
saw
her
stopping
to
gaze
down
on
the
sea
starting
again
along
the
heights
blown
out
of
her
course
and
regaining
it
by
struggling
up
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
he
at
once
hastened
in
pursuit
trying
as
much
as
possible
to
keep
out
of
her
sight
and
was
gradually
lessening
the
distance
between
them
when
on
crossing
the
hollow
already
mentioned
he
saw
her
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
close
to
the
pinnacle
on
which
she
had
stood
the
night
before
where
after
standing
for
a
moment
she
sank
downwards
and
vanished
but
whether
into
earth
or
air
he
could
not
tell
he
approached
the
place
a
blast
of
more
than
ordinary
violence
fought
against
him
as
if
determined
to
preserve
the
secret
of
its
favourite
refuge
but
he
persisted
and
gained
the
spot
he
then
found
that
the
real
edge
of
the
precipice
was
several
yards
farther
off
the
ground
sloping
away
from
where
he
stood
at
his
feet
in
the
slope
was
an
almost
perpendicular
opening
he
hesitated
a
little
but
sure
that
the
child
was
a
real
human
child
and
no
phantom
he
did
not
hesitate
long
he
entered
and
found
it
lead
spirally
downwards
descending
with
some
difficulty
for
the
passage
was
narrow
he
arrived
at
a
small
chamber
into
one
corner
of
which
the
stone
shaft
containing
the
stair
projected
half
its
round
the
chamber
looked
as
if
it
had
been
hollowed
out
of
the
rock
a
narrow
window
little
more
than
a
through
the
thick
wall
admitted
the
roar
of
the
waves
and
a
dim
grey
light
this
light
was
just
sufficient
to
show
him
the
child
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
chamber
bending
forward
with
her
hands
between
her
knees
in
a
posture
that
indicated
fear
the
little
playfellow
of
the
winds
was
not
sure
of
him
at
the
first
word
he
spoke
a
which
had
made
its
home
in
the
apartment
startled
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
dashed
through
the
window
with
a
sudden
clang
of
wings
into
the
great
misty
void
without
and
herbert
looking
out
after
it
almost
forgot
the
presence
of
the
little
girl
in
the
awe
and
delight
of
the
spectacle
before
him
it
was
now
much
darker
and
the
fog
had
settled
down
more
closely
on
the
face
of
the
deep
but
just
below
him
he
could
see
the
surface
of
the
ocean
whose
mad
waves
appeared
to
rush
bellowing
out
of
the
unseen
on
to
the
shore
of
the
visible
when
after
some
effort
he
succeeded
in
leaning
out
of
the
window
he
could
see
the
shore
beneath
him
for
he
was
on
its
extreme
verge
and
the
spray
now
and
then
dashed
through
the
into
the
chamber
he
was
still
gazing
and
absorbed
when
a
sweet
timid
voice
that
yet
partook
undefinably
of
the
wildness
of
a
startled
him
out
of
his
contemplation
my
mother
send
you
to
me
said
the
voice
he
looked
down
close
beside
him
stood
the
child
gazing
earnestly
up
into
his
face
through
the
twilight
from
the
window
does
your
mother
live
asked
herbert
out
there
the
child
answered
pointing
to
the
window
while
he
was
thinking
what
she
could
mean
she
continued
is
angry
but
when
the
sun
comes
out
and
those
nasty
clouds
are
driven
away
she
will
laugh
again
mother
does
not
like
black
clouds
and
fogs
they
spoil
her
house
still
perplexed
as
to
the
child
meaning
herbert
asked
your
mother
love
you
except
when
she
is
angry
she
does
not
love
me
but
perhaps
she
will
be
all
over
laughs
to
me
and
that
makes
me
run
to
her
and
she
will
smile
to
me
all
day
till
night
comes
and
she
goes
to
sleep
and
leaves
me
alone
for
i
hear
her
sleeping
but
i
can
not
go
to
sleep
with
her
here
the
curate
interrupted
his
reading
to
remark
that
he
feared
he
had
spoiled
the
pathos
of
the
child
words
by
translating
them
into
english
but
that
they
must
gain
more
for
the
occasion
by
being
made
intelligible
to
his
audience
than
they
could
lose
by
the
change
from
their
original
form
herbert
sympathies
had
by
this
time
made
him
suspect
that
the
child
must
be
talking
of
the
sea
which
somehow
she
had
come
to
regard
as
her
mother
he
asked
does
your
father
live
then
have
not
any
father
she
answered
had
one
but
mother
took
him
several
other
questions
herbert
put
but
still
the
child
notions
ran
in
the
same
channel
they
were
wild
notions
but
uttered
with
confidence
as
if
they
were
the
most
ordinary
facts
it
seemed
that
whatever
her
imagination
suggested
bore
to
her
the
impress
of
truth
and
that
she
knew
no
higher
reality
by
this
time
it
was
almost
dark
must
go
home
said
herbert
will
go
with
you
responded
the
girl
she
ran
along
beside
him
but
in
the
discursive
manner
natural
to
her
till
coming
to
one
of
the
paths
descending
towards
the
shore
she
darted
down
without
saying
even
next
day
the
storm
having
abated
and
the
sun
shining
out
they
were
standing
on
the
beach
near
a
fisherman
who
like
them
was
gazing
seawards
when
the
child
went
skimming
past
along
the
shore
netherby
asked
the
fisherman
about
her
and
learned
the
secret
of
the
sea
motherhood
she
had
been
washed
ashore
from
the
wreck
of
a
vessel
and
was
found
on
the
beach
tied
to
a
spar
all
besides
had
perished
from
the
fragment
they
judged
it
to
have
been
a
dutch
vessel
some
one
had
said
in
her
hearing
child
the
sea
is
her
mother
and
her
imagination
had
cherished
the
idea
a
fisherman
who
had
no
family
had
taken
her
to
his
house
and
loved
her
dearly
but
he
lost
his
wife
shortly
after
and
a
year
or
two
ago
the
sea
had
taken
him
the
only
father
she
knew
all
however
were
kind
to
her
she
was
welcome
wherever
she
chose
to
go
and
share
with
the
family
but
no
one
knew
today
where
she
would
be
where
she
would
have
her
next
meal
or
where
she
would
sleep
she
was
wild
impulsive
affectionate
the
simple
people
of
the
village
believed
her
to
be
of
foreign
birth
and
high
descent
while
reverence
for
her
lonely
conditions
made
them
treat
her
with
affection
as
well
as
deference
so
that
the
forsaken
child
regarded
as
subject
to
no
law
was
as
happy
in
her
freedom
and
confidence
as
any
wild
winged
thing
of
the
land
or
sea
the
summer
loved
her
the
winter
strengthened
her
her
first
baptism
in
the
salt
waters
had
made
her
a
free
creature
of
the
earth
and
skies
had
fortified
her
against
all
hardship
cold
and
nakedness
to
come
had
delivered
her
from
the
bonds
of
habit
and
custom
and
shown
in
her
what
earth
and
air
of
themselves
can
do
to
make
the
lowest
most
undeveloped
life
a
divine
gift
the
following
morning
the
sea
was
smooth
and
clear
so
was
the
sky
looking
down
from
their
cottage
the
sea
appeared
to
herbert
to
slope
steeply
up
to
the
horizon
so
that
the
shore
lay
like
a
deep
narrow
valley
between
him
and
it
far
down
at
the
low
pier
he
saw
a
little
boat
belonging
to
a
retired
the
oars
were
on
board
and
the
owner
and
some
one
with
him
were
walking
towards
the
boat
now
the
captain
had
promised
to
take
him
with
him
some
day
he
was
down
the
road
a
moment
after
the
words
of
permission
had
left
his
mother
lips
and
was
waiting
at
the
boat
when
the
two
men
came
up
they
readily
agreed
to
let
him
go
with
them
they
were
going
to
row
to
a
village
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bay
and
return
in
the
evening
herbert
was
speechless
with
delight
they
got
in
the
boat
heaving
beneath
them
unmoored
and
pushed
off
this
suspension
between
sea
and
sky
was
a
new
sensation
to
herbert
for
when
he
looked
down
his
eye
did
not
repose
on
the
surface
but
penetrated
far
into
a
clear
green
abyss
where
the
power
of
vision
seemed
rather
to
vanish
than
be
arrested
when
he
looked
up
the
shore
was
behind
them
and
he
knew
for
the
first
time
what
it
was
to
look
at
the
land
as
he
had
looked
at
the
sea
to
regard
the
land
in
its
turn
as
a
observing
it
apart
from
himself
running
along
the
shore
like
a
little
bird
he
saw
the
child
of
the
sea
and
further
to
the
right
the
peak
on
which
she
had
stood
in
the
sunset
and
into
whose
mysterious
chamber
she
had
led
him
the
captain
here
put
a
into
his
hand
and
with
this
annihilator
of
space
he
made
new
discoveries
he
saw
a
little
window
in
the
cliff
doubtless
the
same
from
which
he
had
looked
out
on
the
dim
sea
and
then
perceived
that
the
front
of
the
cliff
in
that
part
was
no
rock
but
a
wall
regularly
and
strongly
built
it
was
evidently
the
remains
of
an
old
fortress
the
front
foundation
had
been
laid
in
the
rocks
of
the
shore
the
cliff
had
then
been
faced
up
with
masonry
and
behind
chambers
had
been
cut
in
the
rock
into
one
of
which
herbert
had
descended
a
ruined
spiral
stair
the
castle
itself
which
had
stood
on
the
top
had
mouldered
away
leaving
only
a
rugged
and
broken
surface
by
this
time
they
were
near
the
opposite
shore
and
herbert
looked
up
with
dread
at
the
great
cliffs
that
rose
perpendicularly
out
of
the
water
which
heaved
slowly
and
heavily
with
an
appearance
of
immense
depth
against
them
their
black
jagged
sides
had
huge
holes
into
which
the
sea
rushed
far
into
the
dark
with
a
muffled
roar
and
large
protuberances
of
rock
bare
and
threatening
numberless
shadows
lay
on
their
faces
and
here
and
there
from
their
tops
trickled
little
steams
plashing
into
the
waves
at
their
feet
passing
through
a
natural
arch
in
a
rock
lofty
and
narrow
called
the
devil
bridge
and
turning
a
little
promontory
they
were
soon
aground
on
the
beach
when
the
captain
had
finished
his
business
they
had
some
dinner
at
the
inn
and
while
the
two
men
drank
their
grog
herbert
was
a
delighted
listener
to
many
a
sea
story
old
and
new
how
the
boy
longed
to
be
a
sailor
and
live
always
on
the
great
waters
the
blocks
and
cordage
of
the
flagstaff
before
the
inn
assumed
an
almost
magic
interest
to
him
as
the
two
sailors
went
on
with
their
tales
of
winds
and
rocks
and
narrow
escapes
and
shipwrecks
and
how
proud
he
was
of
the
friendship
of
these
old
seafarers
at
length
it
was
time
to
return
home
as
they
rowed
slowly
along
the
sun
was
going
down
in
the
west
and
their
shadows
were
flung
far
on
the
waves
which
gleamed
and
glistened
in
the
rich
calm
light
land
and
sea
were
bathed
in
the
blessing
of
heaven
its
glory
was
on
the
rocks
and
on
the
shore
and
in
the
depth
of
the
heaving
sea
under
the
boat
wherever
it
went
shone
a
paler
green
the
only
sounds
were
of
the
oars
in
the
of
the
drip
from
their
blades
as
they
rose
and
made
curves
in
the
air
and
the
low
plash
with
which
they
dipped
again
into
the
sea
while
the
water
in
the
wake
of
the
boat
hastened
to
compose
itself
again
to
that
sleep
from
which
it
had
been
unwillingly
roused
by
the
passing
keel
the
boy
heart
was
full
often
in
after
years
he
longed
for
the
wings
of
a
dove
that
he
might
fly
to
that
boat
still
floating
in
the
calm
sea
of
his
memory
and
there
lie
until
his
spirit
had
had
rest
enough
the
next
time
that
herbert
approached
the
little
girl
she
waited
his
coming
and
while
they
talked
netherby
joined
them
with
her
effie
presently
the
gaze
of
the
was
fixed
upon
little
effie
to
the
all
but
total
neglect
of
the
others
the
result
of
this
contemplation
was
visible
the
next
day
netherby
having
invited
her
to
come
and
see
them
the
following
morning
as
they
were
seated
at
breakfast
the
door
of
the
room
opened
without
any
prefatory
tap
and
in
peeped
with
wild
confidence
the
smiling
face
of
the
untamed
undine
it
was
at
once
evident
that
civilization
had
laid
a
finger
upon
her
and
that
a
new
womanly
impulse
had
been
awakened
for
there
she
stood
gazing
at
effie
and
with
both
hands
smoothing
down
her
own
hair
which
she
had
managed
after
a
fashion
to
part
in
the
middle
and
had
plentifully
wetted
with
in
her
run
up
the
height
it
had
begun
to
dry
and
little
spangles
of
salt
were
visible
all
over
it
she
could
not
alter
her
dress
whose
many
slashes
showed
little
lining
except
her
skin
but
she
had
done
all
she
could
to
approximate
her
appearance
to
that
of
effie
whom
she
seemed
to
regard
as
a
little
divinity
netherby
heart
was
drawn
towards
the
motherless
child
and
she
clothed
her
from
head
to
foot
though
how
far
this
was
a
benefit
as
regarded
cold
and
heat
is
a
question
herbert
began
to
teach
her
to
read
in
which
her
progress
was
just
like
her
bodily
movements
over
the
earth
surface
now
a
dead
pause
and
now
the
flight
of
a
bird
now
and
then
she
would
suddenly
start
up
heedless
where
her
book
might
happen
to
fall
and
rush
out
along
the
heights
returning
next
day
or
the
same
afternoon
and
without
any
apology
resuming
her
studies
this
holiday
was
to
herbert
one
of
those
seasons
which
tinge
the
whole
of
the
future
life
it
was
a
storehouse
of
sights
and
sounds
and
images
of
thought
a
wherein
to
clothe
the
ideas
that
came
forth
to
act
their
parts
upon
the
stage
of
reason
often
at
night
just
ere
the
sleep
that
wipes
out
the
day
from
the
overfilled
and
blotted
tablets
of
the
brain
enwrapped
him
in
its
cool
garments
a
vision
of
the
darkened
sea
spotted
and
spangled
with
pools
of
unutterable
light
would
rise
before
him
unbidden
in
that
infinite
space
for
creation
which
lies
dark
and
waiting
under
the
closed
eyelids
the
darkened
sea
might
be
but
the
image
of
his
own
overshadowed
soul
and
the
spots
of
light
the
visual
form
of
his
hopes
so
clearly
would
these
be
present
to
him
sometimes
that
when
he
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
into
the
darkness
of
his
room
he
would
see
the
bright
spaces
shining
before
him
still
then
he
would
fall
asleep
and
dream
on
about
the
sea
watching
a
little
cutter
perhaps
as
leaned
to
the
lee
and
girdled
the
wave
flinging
the
waters
from
her
bows
and
parting
a
path
for
herself
between
or
he
would
be
seated
with
the
helm
in
his
hand
and
all
the
force
and
the
joy
wherewith
she
dashed
headlong
on
the
rising
waves
and
half
pierced
them
and
half
drove
them
under
her
triumphant
keel
would
be
issuing
from
his
will
and
his
triumph
surely
even
for
the
sad
despairing
waves
there
is
some
hope
out
in
that
boundless
room
which
borders
on
the
sky
and
upon
which
even
in
the
gloomiest
hour
of
tempest
falls
sometimes
from
heaven
a
glory
intense
so
when
the
time
came
that
the
lover
of
waters
must
return
he
went
back
enriched
with
new
visions
of
them
in
their
great
home
and
motherland
he
had
seen
them
still
and
silent
as
a
soul
in
holy
trance
he
had
seen
them
raving
in
a
fury
of
livid
green
swarming
with
waves
he
had
seen
them
lying
in
one
narrow
ridge
of
unbroken
blue
where
the
eye
finding
no
marks
to
measure
the
distance
withal
saw
miles
as
furlongs
and
he
had
seen
sweeps
and
shadows
innumerable
stretched
along
its
calm
expanse
so
dividing
it
into
regions
and
graduating
the
distance
that
the
eye
seemed
to
wander
on
and
on
from
sea
to
sea
and
the
ships
to
float
in
oceans
beyond
oceans
of
infinite
reach
o
lonely
space
awful
indeed
wert
thou
did
no
one
love
us
but
he
had
yet
to
receive
one
more
vision
of
the
waters
and
that
was
to
be
in
a
dream
with
this
dream
i
will
close
the
story
of
his
holiday
for
it
went
with
him
ever
after
breaking
forth
from
the
and
encompassing
his
waking
thoughts
with
an
atmosphere
of
courage
and
hope
when
his
heart
was
ready
to
sink
in
a
world
which
was
not
the
world
the
boy
had
thought
to
enter
when
he
ran
to
welcome
his
fate
on
their
last
sunday
herbert
went
with
his
mother
to
the
evening
service
in
a
little
chapel
in
the
midst
of
the
fishermen
cottages
it
was
a
curious
little
place
with
galleries
round
that
nearly
met
in
the
middle
and
a
high
pulpit
with
a
great
over
it
from
which
came
the
voice
of
an
earnest
little
methodist
magnified
by
his
position
into
a
mighty
prophet
the
good
man
was
preaching
on
the
parable
of
sheep
and
the
goats
and
in
his
earnestness
for
his
own
theology
and
the
souls
of
his
hearers
was
not
content
that
the
lord
should
say
these
things
in
his
own
way
but
he
must
say
them
in
his
too
and
a
terrible
utterance
it
was
looking
about
unconsciously
seeking
some
relief
from
the
accumulation
of
horrors
with
which
the
preacher
was
threatening
the
goats
of
his
congregation
herbert
spied
in
the
very
front
of
one
of
the
side
galleries
his
little
pupil
white
with
terror
and
staring
with
round
unwinking
eyes
full
in
the
face
of
the
prophet
of
fear
never
after
could
he
read
the
parable
without
seeing
the
blanched
face
of
the
child
and
feeling
a
renewal
of
that
evening
sadness
over
the
fate
of
the
poor
goats
which
afterwards
grew
into
the
question
god
care
for
oxen
and
not
for
goats
he
never
saw
the
child
again
for
they
left
the
next
day
and
she
did
not
come
to
bid
them
as
he
went
home
from
the
chapel
her
face
of
terror
haunted
him
that
night
he
fell
asleep
as
usual
with
the
sound
of
the
waves
in
his
soul
and
as
he
slept
he
he
stood
as
he
thought
upon
the
cliff
within
which
lay
the
remnants
of
the
old
castle
the
sun
was
slowly
sinking
down
the
western
sky
and
a
great
glory
lay
upon
the
sea
close
to
the
shore
beneath
by
the
side
of
some
low
rocks
floated
a
little
boat
he
thought
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
lie
in
the
boat
in
the
sunlight
and
let
it
die
away
upon
his
bosom
he
scrambled
down
the
rocks
stepped
on
board
and
laid
himself
in
the
boat
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
sinking
sun
lower
and
lower
the
sun
sank
seeming
to
draw
the
heavens
after
him
like
a
net
at
length
he
plunged
beneath
the
waves
but
as
his
last
rays
disappeared
on
the
horizon
lo
a
new
splendour
burst
upon
the
astonished
boy
the
whole
waters
were
illuminated
from
beneath
with
the
permeating
glories
of
the
buried
radiance
in
rainbow
circles
and
intermingling
fluctuating
sweeps
of
colours
the
sea
lay
like
an
intense
opal
molten
with
the
fire
of
its
own
hues
the
sky
gave
back
the
effulgence
with
a
less
deep
but
more
heavenly
loveliness
but
betwixt
the
sea
and
the
sky
just
over
the
grave
of
the
sun
a
dark
spot
appeared
parting
the
earth
and
the
heaven
where
they
had
mingled
in
embraces
of
light
and
the
dark
spot
grew
and
spread
and
a
cold
breath
came
softly
over
the
face
of
the
shining
waters
and
the
colours
paled
away
and
as
the
withered
and
grew
grey
below
the
clouds
withered
and
darkened
above
the
sea
began
to
swell
and
moan
and
look
up
like
the
soul
of
a
man
whose
joy
is
going
down
in
darkness
and
a
horror
came
over
the
heart
of
the
sleeper
and
in
his
dream
he
lifted
up
his
head
meaning
to
rise
and
hasten
to
his
home
but
behold
the
shore
was
far
away
and
the
great
had
sunk
to
a
low
ridge
with
a
cry
he
sank
back
on
the
bosom
of
the
careless
sea
the
boat
began
to
rise
and
fall
on
the
waking
waves
then
a
great
blast
of
wind
laid
hold
of
it
and
whirled
it
about
once
more
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
the
tops
of
the
waves
were
torn
away
and
that
white
water
was
coming
out
of
the
black
higher
and
higher
rose
the
billows
louder
and
louder
roared
the
wind
across
their
jagged
furrows
tearing
awful
descants
from
their
bursting
chords
and
tossing
the
little
boat
like
a
leaf
in
the
lone
desert
of
storms
now
holding
it
perched
on
the
very
crest
of
a
wave
in
the
mad
eye
of
the
tempest
while
the
chaotic
waters
danced
raving
about
in
hopeless
confusion
now
letting
it
sink
in
the
hollow
of
the
waves
and
lifting
above
it
cold
glittering
walls
of
water
that
becalmed
it
as
in
a
sheltered
vale
while
the
hurricane
roaring
above
flung
arches
of
writhing
waters
across
from
billow
to
billow
overhead
and
threatened
to
close
as
in
a
transparent
tomb
boat
and
boy
at
length
when
the
boat
rose
once
more
unwilling
to
the
awful
ridge
jagged
and
white
a
yet
fiercer
blast
tore
it
from
the
top
of
the
wave
the
dreamer
found
himself
choking
in
the
waters
and
soon
lost
all
consciousness
of
the
buffeting
waves
or
the
shrieking
winds
when
the
dreamer
again
awoke
he
felt
that
he
was
carried
along
through
the
storm
above
the
waves
for
they
reached
him
only
in
bursts
of
spray
though
the
wind
raged
around
him
more
fiercely
than
ever
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
downwards
beneath
him
seethed
and
boiled
the
tumultuous
billows
their
wreathy
tops
torn
from
them
and
shot
in
long
vanishing
sheets
of
spray
over
the
distracted
wilderness
such
was
the
turmoil
beneath
that
he
had
to
close
his
eyes
again
to
feel
that
he
was
moving
onwards
the
next
time
he
opened
them
it
was
to
look
up
and
lo
a
shadowy
face
bent
over
him
whence
love
unutterable
was
falling
in
floods
from
eyes
deep
and
dark
and
still
as
the
heavens
that
are
above
the
clouds
great
waves
of
hair
streamed
back
from
a
noble
head
and
floated
on
the
tides
of
the
tempest
the
face
was
like
his
mother
and
like
his
father
and
like
a
face
that
he
had
seen
somewhere
in
a
picture
but
far
more
beautiful
and
strong
and
loving
than
all
with
a
sudden
glory
of
gladness
in
which
the
spouting
pinnacles
of
the
fathomless
pyramids
of
wandering
waters
dwindled
into
the
confusion
of
a
few
troubled
he
knew
he
knew
that
the
lord
was
carrying
his
lamb
in
his
bosom
around
him
were
the
everlasting
arms
and
above
him
the
lamps
that
light
heaven
and
earth
the
eyes
that
watch
and
are
not
weary
and
now
he
felt
the
arms
in
which
he
lay
and
he
nestled
close
to
that
true
wise
bosom
which
has
room
in
it
for
all
and
where
none
will
strive
over
the
waters
went
the
master
now
crossing
the
calm
hollows
now
climbing
the
rising
wave
now
shrouded
in
the
upper
ocean
of
drifting
spray
that
wrapped
him
around
with
whirling
force
and
anon
calmly
descending
the
gliding
slope
into
the
glassy
trough
below
sometimes
when
he
looked
up
the
dreamer
could
see
nothing
but
the
clouds
driving
across
the
heavens
whence
now
and
then
a
star
in
a
little
well
of
blue
looked
down
upon
him
but
anon
he
knew
that
the
driving
clouds
were
his
drifting
hair
and
that
the
stars
in
the
blue
wells
of
heaven
were
his
eyes
over
the
sea
he
strode
and
the
floods
lifted
up
their
heads
in
vain
the
billows
would
gather
and
burst
around
and
over
them
but
a
moment
more
and
the
billows
were
beneath
his
feet
and
on
they
were
going
safe
and
sure
long
time
the
journey
endured
and
the
dream
faded
and
again
revived
it
was
as
if
he
had
slept
and
again
awaked
for
he
lay
in
soft
grass
on
a
and
the
form
of
a
mighty
man
lay
outstretched
beside
him
who
was
weary
with
a
great
weariness
below
the
sea
howled
and
beat
against
the
base
of
the
mountain
but
it
was
far
below
again
the
lord
arose
and
lifted
him
up
and
bore
him
onwards
up
to
the
they
went
through
the
keen
cold
air
and
over
the
fields
of
snow
and
ice
on
the
peak
the
master
paused
and
looked
down
in
a
vast
amphitheatre
below
was
gathered
a
multitude
that
no
man
could
number
they
crowded
on
all
sides
beyond
the
reach
of
the
sight
rising
up
the
slopes
of
the
surrounding
mountains
till
they
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
grouped
and
massed
upon
height
above
height
filling
the
hollows
and
plains
and
platforms
all
about
but
every
eye
looked
towards
the
lowest
centre
of
the
where
a
little
vacant
spot
awaited
the
presence
of
some
form
which
should
be
the
heart
of
all
the
throng
down
towards
this
centre
the
lord
bore
him
entering
the
holy
circle
he
set
him
gently
down
and
then
looked
all
around
as
if
searching
earnestly
for
some
one
he
could
not
see
and
not
finding
whom
he
sought
he
walked
across
the
open
space
a
path
was
instantly
divided
for
him
through
the
dense
multitude
surrounding
it
along
this
lane
of
men
and
women
and
children
he
went
and
herbert
ran
following
close
at
his
feet
for
now
all
the
universe
seemed
empty
save
where
he
was
and
he
was
not
rebuked
but
suffered
to
follow
and
although
the
lord
walked
fast
and
far
the
feet
following
him
were
not
weary
but
grew
in
speed
and
in
power
through
the
great
crowd
and
beyond
it
never
looking
back
up
and
over
the
brow
of
the
mountain
they
went
and
leaving
behind
them
the
gathered
universe
of
men
descended
into
a
pale
night
hither
and
hither
went
the
master
searching
up
and
down
the
gloomy
valley
now
looking
behind
a
great
rock
and
now
through
a
thicket
of
brushwood
now
entering
a
dark
cave
and
now
ascending
a
height
and
gazing
all
around
till
at
last
on
a
bare
plain
seated
on
a
grey
stone
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
they
found
the
little
orphan
child
who
had
called
the
sea
her
mother
as
he
drew
near
to
her
the
lord
called
out
poor
little
lamb
i
have
found
you
at
last
but
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
or
understand
what
he
said
for
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
held
up
her
clasped
hands
and
cried
not
be
angry
with
me
i
am
a
goat
and
i
ran
away
because
i
was
afraid
do
not
burn
me
but
all
the
answer
the
lord
made
was
to
stoop
and
lift
her
and
hold
her
to
his
breast
and
she
was
an
orphan
no
more
so
he
turned
and
went
back
over
hill
and
over
dale
and
herbert
followed
rejoicing
that
the
lost
lamb
was
found
as
he
followed
he
spied
in
a
crevice
of
a
rock
close
by
his
path
a
lovely
primrose
he
stooped
to
pluck
it
and
ere
he
began
again
to
follow
a
cock
crew
shrill
and
loud
and
he
knew
it
was
the
cock
that
rebuked
peter
and
he
trembled
and
stood
up
the
master
had
vanished
he
too
fell
bitterly
and
again
the
cock
crew
and
he
opened
his
eyes
and
knew
that
he
had
dreamed
his
mother
stood
by
his
bedside
comforting
the
weeper
with
kisses
and
he
cried
to
her
mother
surely
he
would
not
come
over
the
sea
to
find
me
in
the
storm
and
then
leave
me
because
i
stopped
to
pluck
a
flower
too
long
i
am
afraid
said
the
curate
the
moment
he
had
finished
his
paper
looking
at
his
watch
we
have
not
thought
so
i
am
sure
said
adela
courteously
the
ladies
rose
to
go
who
is
to
read
next
said
the
schoolmaster
why
of
course
said
the
curate
indignantly
it
ought
to
be
my
brother
but
there
is
no
depending
on
him
if
this
frost
lasts
i
will
positively
read
next
time
said
the
doctor
but
you
know
ralph
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
bring
something
else
with
you
lest
i
should
fail
again
cool
said
the
curate
i
think
it
is
time
we
dropped
it
no
please
do
said
harry
with
a
little
anxiety
in
his
tone
i
really
want
to
read
my
story
it
looks
like
it
does
it
now
ralph
a
clergyman
should
never
be
sarcastic
be
as
indignant
as
you
please
but
sarcastic
never
it
is
very
easy
for
you
who
know
just
what
you
have
to
do
and
have
besides
whole
volumes
in
that
rickety
old
desk
of
yours
to
keep
such
an
appointment
as
this
mine
is
produced
for
the
occasion
and
i
can
not
tell
what
may
be
required
of
me
from
one
hour
to
another
he
went
up
to
adela
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
failed
again
he
said
but
you
wo
next
time
will
you
i
will
not
if
i
can
help
it
chapter
iv
interruption
but
it
was
adela
herself
who
failed
next
time
i
had
seen
her
during
the
reading
draw
her
shawl
about
her
as
if
she
were
cold
she
seemed
quite
well
when
the
friends
left
but
she
had
caught
a
chill
and
before
the
morning
she
was
quite
feverish
and
unable
to
leave
her
bed
you
see
colonel
said
cathcart
at
breakfast
that
this
doctor
of
yours
is
doing
the
child
harm
instead
of
good
he
has
been
suppressing
instead
of
curing
the
complaint
and
now
she
is
worse
than
ever
when
the
devil
i
began
to
remark
in
reply
mr
smith
exclaimed
cathcart
allow
me
madam
to
finish
my
sentence
before
you
make
up
your
mind
to
be
when
the
devil
goes
out
of
a
man
or
a
woman
either
he
gives
a
terrible
wrench
by
way
of
farewell
now
as
the
prophet
job
teaches
us
all
disease
is
from
the
devil
and
the
prophet
job
mr
smith
well
the
old
arab
scheik
if
you
like
that
epithet
better
really
mr
smith
well
i
do
mind
what
you
call
him
i
only
mean
to
say
that
a
disease
sometimes
goes
out
with
a
kind
of
flare
like
a
candle
or
like
the
poor
life
itself
i
believe
if
this
is
an
intermittent
fever
as
from
your
description
i
expect
it
will
prove
to
be
it
will
be
the
best
thing
for
her
well
we
shall
see
what
wade
will
say
dr
wade
i
exclaimed
of
course
my
brother
will
not
think
of
trusting
such
a
serious
case
to
an
inexperienced
young
man
like
mr
armstrong
it
seems
to
me
i
replied
that
for
some
time
the
case
has
ceased
to
be
a
serious
one
you
must
allow
that
adela
is
better
seemed
to
be
better
smith
but
it
was
all
excitement
and
here
is
the
consequence
i
as
far
as
i
have
any
influence
decidedly
object
to
armstrong
having
anything
more
to
do
with
the
case
perhaps
you
are
right
jane
said
the
colonel
i
fear
you
are
but
how
can
i
ask
wade
to
resume
his
attendance
always
nervous
about
adela
his
had
at
length
succeeded
in
frightening
him
leave
that
to
me
she
said
i
will
manage
him
pooh
said
i
rudely
he
will
jump
at
it
it
will
be
a
grand
triumph
for
him
i
only
want
you
to
mind
what
you
are
about
you
know
adela
does
not
like
dr
wade
and
she
does
like
armstrong
said
cathcart
stuffing
each
word
with
significance
yes
i
answered
boldly
who
would
not
prefer
the
one
to
the
other
but
her
arrow
had
struck
the
colonel
rose
and
saying
only
well
jane
i
leave
the
affair
in
your
hands
walked
out
of
the
room
i
was
coward
enough
to
follow
him
had
it
been
of
any
use
coward
as
i
was
i
would
have
remained
but
cathcart
if
she
had
not
reckoned
without
her
host
had
at
least
reckoned
without
her
hostess
she
wrote
instantly
to
wade
in
terms
of
which
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
were
successful
for
they
brought
the
doctor
at
once
i
saw
him
pass
through
the
hall
looking
awfully
stiff
important
and
condescending
beeves
who
had
opened
the
door
to
him
gave
me
a
very
queer
look
as
he
showed
him
into
the
ringing
at
the
same
time
for
adela
maid
now
cathcart
had
not
expected
that
the
doctor
would
arrive
so
soon
and
had
as
yet
been
unable
to
make
up
her
mind
how
to
communicate
to
the
patient
the
news
of
the
change
in
the
physical
ministry
so
when
the
maid
brought
the
message
all
that
her
cunning
could
provide
her
with
at
the
moment
was
the
pretence
that
he
had
called
so
opportunely
by
chance
ask
him
to
walk
up
she
said
after
just
one
moment
hesitation
adela
heard
the
direction
her
aunt
gave
through
the
cold
shiver
which
was
then
obliterating
rather
than
engrossing
her
attention
and
concluded
that
they
had
sent
for
armstrong
but
cathcart
turning
towards
her
said
adela
my
love
wade
had
just
called
and
i
have
asked
him
to
step
up
stairs
the
patient
started
up
aunt
what
do
you
mean
if
that
old
wife
comes
into
this
room
i
will
make
him
glad
to
go
out
of
it
you
see
she
was
feverish
poor
child
else
i
am
sure
she
could
not
have
been
so
rude
to
her
aunt
but
before
cathcart
could
reply
in
came
wade
he
walked
right
up
to
the
bed
after
a
stately
obeisance
to
the
lady
attendant
i
am
sorry
to
find
you
so
ill
miss
cathcart
i
am
perfectly
well
wade
i
am
sorry
you
have
had
the
trouble
of
walking
up
stairs
as
she
said
this
she
rang
the
bell
at
the
head
of
her
bed
her
maid
who
had
been
listening
at
the
door
entered
at
i
had
all
this
from
adela
herself
afterwards
emma
bring
me
my
desk
wade
there
must
be
some
mistake
it
was
my
aunt
cathcart
who
sent
for
you
had
she
given
me
the
opportunity
i
would
have
begged
that
the
interview
might
take
place
in
her
room
instead
of
mine
wade
retreated
towards
the
fireplace
where
cathcart
stood
quite
aware
that
she
had
got
herself
into
a
mess
of
no
ordinary
complication
yet
she
persisted
in
her
cunning
she
lifted
her
finger
to
her
forehead
ah
said
wade
yes
said
cathcart
wandering
dreadfully
after
some
more
whispering
the
doctor
sat
down
to
write
a
prescription
but
meantime
adela
was
busy
writing
another
what
she
wrote
was
precisely
to
this
effect
dear
armstrong
i
have
caught
a
bad
cold
and
my
aunt
has
let
loose
wade
upon
me
please
come
directly
if
you
will
save
me
from
ever
so
much
nasty
medicine
at
the
least
my
aunt
is
not
my
mother
thank
heaven
though
she
would
gladly
usurp
that
relationship
yours
most
truly
adela
cathcart
she
folded
and
sealed
the
note
sealed
it
carefully
and
gave
it
to
emma
who
vanished
with
it
followed
instantly
by
cathcart
as
to
what
took
place
outside
the
door
shall
i
confess
it
beeves
is
my
informant
where
are
you
going
emma
emma
come
here
directly
said
cathcart
emma
obeyed
i
am
going
a
message
for
who
is
that
note
for
i
did
ask
john
can
read
well
enough
show
it
me
emma
i
presume
closed
both
lips
and
hand
very
tight
i
command
you
miss
cathcart
pays
me
my
wages
said
emma
and
turning
sped
like
a
in
the
hall
she
met
beeves
and
told
him
the
story
there
she
comes
cried
he
give
me
the
letter
i
take
it
myself
you
not
going
without
your
hat
surely
beeves
said
emma
bless
me
it
there
master
old
one
he
never
want
it
again
and
if
he
does
it
be
none
the
worse
and
he
was
out
of
the
door
in
a
moment
beeves
alarm
however
as
to
cathcart
approach
was
a
false
one
she
returned
into
the
sick
chamber
with
a
face
fiery
red
and
found
wade
just
finishing
an
elaborate
prescription
there
said
he
rising
send
for
that
at
once
and
let
it
be
taken
directly
good
morning
he
left
the
room
instantly
making
signs
that
he
was
afraid
of
exciting
his
patient
as
she
did
not
appear
to
approve
of
his
presence
what
is
the
prescription
said
adela
quite
quietly
as
cathcart
approached
the
bed
apparently
trying
to
decipher
it
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
much
calmer
my
dear
you
must
not
excite
yourself
the
prescription
i
can
not
make
it
out
doctors
do
write
so
badly
i
suppose
they
consider
it
professional
they
consider
a
good
many
things
professional
which
are
only
stupid
let
me
see
it
cathcart
thrown
off
her
guard
gave
it
to
her
adela
tore
it
in
fragments
and
threw
it
in
a
little
storm
on
the
floor
adela
screamed
cathcart
what
is
to
be
done
pay
wade
his
fee
and
tell
him
i
shall
never
be
too
ill
to
refuse
his
medicines
now
aunt
you
find
i
am
i
declare
you
make
me
behave
so
ill
that
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
here
the
poor
impertinent
child
crept
under
the
clothes
and
fell
bitterly
cathcart
had
sense
enough
to
see
that
nothing
could
be
done
and
retired
to
her
room
getting
weary
of
her
own
society
after
a
few
moments
of
solitude
she
proceeded
to
go
but
down
she
was
met
full
in
the
face
by
harry
armstrong
ascending
two
steps
at
a
time
he
had
already
met
wade
as
he
came
out
of
the
where
he
had
been
having
an
interview
with
the
colonel
harry
had
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
with
a
how
do
you
do
dr
wade
but
that
gentleman
had
bowed
with
the
utmost
stiffness
and
kept
his
hand
at
home
so
it
is
to
be
open
war
and
mutual
slander
is
it
dr
wade
said
harry
in
that
case
i
want
to
know
how
you
come
to
interfere
with
my
patient
i
have
had
no
dismissal
which
punctilio
i
took
care
to
know
was
observed
in
your
case
sir
i
was
sent
for
said
wade
haughtily
i
have
in
my
pocket
a
note
from
the
lady
of
this
house
requesting
my
immediate
attendance
if
you
have
received
a
request
to
the
same
purport
from
a
visitor
you
obey
it
at
your
own
risk
good
morning
then
harry
walked
quietly
up
the
first
half
of
the
stair
while
beeves
hastened
to
open
the
door
to
the
wade
but
by
the
time
he
met
cathcart
his
rate
of
ascent
had
considerably
increased
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
however
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
usual
formality
of
a
greeting
she
turned
and
her
niece
room
her
eyes
were
flashing
and
her
face
spotted
red
and
white
with
helpless
rage
but
she
would
not
abandon
the
field
harry
bowed
to
her
and
passed
on
to
the
bed
where
he
was
greeted
with
a
smile
there
not
much
the
matter
i
hope
he
said
returning
the
smile
it
may
suit
you
to
make
light
of
my
niece
illness
armstrong
but
i
beg
to
inform
you
that
her
father
thought
it
serious
enough
to
send
for
wade
he
has
been
here
already
and
your
attendance
is
quite
superfluous
no
doubt
no
doubt
but
as
i
am
here
i
may
as
well
prescribe
wade
has
already
prescribed
and
i
have
taken
his
prescription
have
i
not
aunt
and
destroyed
it
armstrong
instead
of
my
own
chance
of
what
said
cathcart
with
vulgar
significance
of
getting
rid
of
two
officious
old
women
at
once
said
adela
in
a
rage
i
fear
i
must
confess
as
the
only
excuse
for
impertinence
come
come
said
harry
this
wo
do
i
can
not
have
my
patient
excited
in
this
way
miss
cathcart
may
i
ring
for
your
maid
for
answer
adela
rang
the
bell
herself
her
aunt
was
pretending
to
look
out
of
the
window
will
you
go
and
ask
your
master
said
harry
when
emma
made
her
appearance
to
be
so
kind
as
come
here
for
a
moment
the
poor
colonel
an
excellent
soldier
a
severe
master
with
the
highest
notions
of
authority
and
obedience
found
himself
degraded
by
his
own
conduct
as
other
autocrats
have
proved
before
into
a
temporizing
incapable
it
was
the
more
humiliating
that
he
was
quite
aware
in
his
own
honest
heart
that
it
was
jealousy
of
harry
that
had
brought
him
into
this
painful
position
but
he
obeyed
the
summons
at
once
for
wherever
there
was
anything
unpleasant
to
be
done
there
with
him
duty
assumed
the
sterner
command
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
harry
without
giving
time
for
anyone
else
to
determine
the
course
of
the
conference
said
there
has
been
some
mistake
colonel
cathcart
between
wade
and
myself
which
has
already
done
miss
cathcart
no
good
as
i
find
her
very
feverish
though
not
by
any
means
alarmingly
ill
i
must
as
her
medical
attendant
insist
that
one
come
into
her
room
but
yourself
or
her
maid
every
one
present
perfectly
understood
this
and
however
in
other
circumstances
the
colonel
might
have
resented
the
tone
of
authority
with
which
harry
spoke
he
was
compelled
for
his
daughter
sake
to
yield
and
he
afterwards
justified
harry
entirely
cathcart
walked
out
of
the
room
with
her
neck
invisible
from
behind
the
colonel
sat
down
by
the
fire
harry
wrote
his
prescription
on
the
half
sheet
from
which
wade
had
torn
his
and
then
saying
that
he
would
call
in
the
evening
took
his
leave
of
the
colonel
and
bowed
to
his
patient
receiving
a
glance
of
acknowledgment
which
could
not
fail
to
generate
the
feeling
that
there
was
a
secret
understanding
between
them
and
that
he
had
done
just
what
she
wanted
he
mounted
his
roan
horse
called
rhubarb
with
a
certain
elation
of
being
which
he
tried
to
hide
from
everyone
but
himself
when
doctors
forget
that
their
patients
are
more
like
musical
instruments
than
machines
they
will
soon
need
to
be
reminded
that
they
are
men
and
women
and
not
dogs
or
horses
yet
alas
for
the
poor
dogs
and
horses
that
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
man
without
a
human
sympathy
even
with
them
i
john
smith
bless
you
my
that
ye
are
not
doctors
merely
but
good
and
loving
men
and
in
virtue
thereof
so
much
the
more
so
exceedingly
the
more
i
need
not
follow
the
course
of
the
fever
each
day
the
arrival
of
the
cold
fit
was
longer
delayed
and
the
violence
of
both
diminished
until
they
disappeared
altogether
but
a
day
or
two
before
this
happy
result
was
completed
adela
had
been
allowed
to
go
down
to
the
and
had
delighted
her
father
with
her
cheerfulness
and
hopefulness
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
ague
had
carried
off
the
last
remnants
of
the
illness
under
which
she
had
been
so
long
labouring
but
then
you
can
never
put
anything
to
the
and
there
were
other
causes
at
work
for
adela
cure
which
were
perhaps
more
powerful
than
even
the
ague
however
this
may
have
been
she
got
almost
quite
well
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
and
with
her
father
consent
issued
invitations
to
another
meeting
of
the
they
were
at
once
satisfactorily
responded
to
chapter
percy
by
this
time
percy
had
returned
to
london
his
mother
remained
but
the
terms
understood
between
her
niece
and
herself
were
those
of
icy
politeness
and
reserve
i
learned
afterwards
that
something
of
an
understanding
had
also
been
arrived
at
between
percy
and
harry
ever
since
learning
the
particulars
of
which
i
have
liked
the
young
rascal
a
great
deal
better
so
i
will
trouble
my
reader
to
take
an
interest
in
my
report
of
the
affair
percy
met
harry
at
the
gate
after
one
of
his
professional
visits
and
accosted
him
thus
armstrong
my
mother
says
you
have
been
rude
to
her
i
am
not
in
the
least
aware
of
it
mr
percy
oh
i
do
care
much
she
is
provoking
besides
she
can
take
care
of
herself
that
not
it
what
is
it
then
what
do
you
mean
about
adela
i
have
said
nothing
more
than
that
she
has
had
a
sharp
attack
of
intermittent
fever
which
is
going
off
come
come
you
know
what
i
mean
i
may
suspect
but
i
do
choose
to
answer
hints
the
meaning
of
which
i
suspect
i
might
make
a
fool
of
myself
well
i
be
plain
are
you
in
love
with
her
suppose
i
were
you
are
not
the
first
to
whom
i
should
think
it
necessary
to
confess
well
are
you
paying
your
addresses
to
her
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
consent
to
make
my
answers
as
frank
as
your
questions
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
in
straightforwardness
i
confess
only
you
have
got
sun
and
wind
of
me
both
come
come
i
hate
dodging
i
daresay
you
do
but
just
let
me
shift
round
a
bit
and
see
what
you
will
do
are
in
love
with
miss
cathcart
yes
upon
my
word
i
should
have
thought
it
here
have
we
been
all
positively
conspiring
to
do
her
good
and
you
have
been
paying
ten
times
the
attention
to
the
dogs
and
horses
that
you
have
paid
to
her
by
jove
it
quite
true
but
i
could
somehow
then
she
has
encouraged
you
by
jupiter
you
are
frank
enough
no
damn
it
not
a
but
she
used
to
like
me
and
she
would
again
if
you
would
let
her
alone
now
percy
i
tell
you
i
do
believe
you
are
a
bit
in
love
with
her
she
devilish
pretty
well
and
i
declare
i
think
she
got
prettier
and
prettier
every
day
till
this
cursed
ague
took
your
fault
too
my
mother
says
we
leave
your
mother
out
of
the
question
now
if
you
please
do
you
know
what
made
her
look
prettier
and
prettier
for
you
are
quite
right
about
that
no
i
suppose
you
were
giving
her
arsenic
no
i
was
giving
her
the
true
unknown
even
to
the
rosicrucians
percy
stared
i
will
explain
myself
her
friend
smith
old
fogie
old
bachelor
mr
smith
and
i
agreed
that
she
was
dying
of
ennui
and
so
we
got
up
this
and
got
my
brother
and
the
rest
to
bear
a
hand
in
it
it
did
her
all
the
good
the
most
sanguine
of
us
could
have
hoped
for
i
thought
it
horrid
slow
i
am
surprised
at
that
for
you
were
generally
asleep
i
was
forced
in
i
could
smoke
it
gave
her
something
to
think
about
so
it
seems
now
percy
how
could
you
think
you
had
the
smallest
chance
with
her
when
here
was
the
first
one
and
then
another
turning
each
the
flash
of
his
own
mental
prism
upon
her
weary
eyes
and
healing
them
with
light
while
you
would
not
take
the
smallest
trouble
to
gratify
her
or
even
to
show
yourself
to
anything
like
advantage
my
dear
fellow
what
a
fool
you
are
mr
armstrong
come
come
you
began
with
frankness
and
i
only
gone
on
with
it
you
are
a
fellow
and
ought
to
be
made
something
of
at
all
events
you
make
something
of
yourself
to
talk
of
your
own
productions
as
the
elixir
you
forget
that
i
am
in
disgrace
as
well
as
yourself
on
that
score
for
i
have
not
read
a
word
of
my
own
since
the
club
began
then
how
the
devil
should
i
be
worse
off
than
you
i
did
say
you
were
i
only
said
you
did
your
best
to
place
yourself
at
a
disadvantage
i
at
least
took
a
part
in
the
affair
although
a
very
humble
one
but
depend
upon
it
a
girl
like
miss
cathcart
thinks
more
of
mental
gifts
than
of
any
outward
advantages
which
a
man
may
possess
and
in
the
company
of
those
who
a
fellow
good
looks
do
go
for
much
she
could
not
help
measuring
you
by
those
other
men
and
women
too
but
you
may
console
yourself
with
the
reflection
that
there
are
plenty
of
girls
and
pretty
ones
too
of
a
very
different
way
of
judging
and
for
my
part
you
are
welcome
to
the
pick
of
them
you
mean
to
say
that
i
have
addie
not
in
the
least
but
come
now
do
you
think
yourself
worthy
of
a
girl
like
that
no
do
you
no
but
i
should
not
feel
such
a
hypocrite
if
she
thought
me
worthy
as
to
give
her
up
on
that
ground
then
what
you
mean
to
win
her
if
i
can
whew
but
if
you
are
a
gentleman
you
will
let
me
say
so
myself
and
not
betray
my
secret
damned
if
i
do
good
luck
to
you
there
my
hand
i
believe
you
a
good
fellow
after
all
i
wish
i
had
seen
you
ride
to
hounds
they
tell
me
it
a
sight
thank
you
heartily
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
go
back
to
the
thames
and
the
dreams
of
the
desk
well
be
a
man
as
well
as
a
gentleman
do
be
a
fool
hang
it
all
i
believe
it
was
her
money
after
all
i
was
in
love
with
but
the
poor
fellow
looked
grave
enough
as
he
went
away
and
i
trust
that
before
long
he
too
began
to
reap
some
of
the
good
corn
that
grows
on
the
wintry
fields
of
i
have
my
eye
upon
him
but
it
is
little
an
like
me
can
do
with
a
fellow
like
percy
chapter
vi
the
cruel
painter
now
to
return
to
the
on
the
night
appointed
we
met
and
to
the
delight
of
all
the
rest
of
us
harry
arrived
with
a
look
that
satisfied
us
that
he
was
to
be
no
defaulter
this
time
the
look
was
one
of
almost
nervous
uneasiness
of
course
this
sprung
from
anxiety
to
please
adela
at
least
so
i
interpreted
it
she
occupied
her
old
place
on
the
couch
we
all
arranged
ourselves
nearly
as
before
and
the
fire
was
burning
very
bright
before
he
began
however
harry
turning
to
our
host
said
may
i
arrange
the
scene
as
i
please
for
the
right
effect
of
my
story
certainly
answered
the
colonel
harry
rose
and
extinguished
the
lamp
but
my
dear
sir
said
the
colonel
how
can
you
read
now
perfectly
by
the
firelight
answered
harry
he
then
went
to
the
windows
and
drawing
aside
the
curtains
drew
up
the
blinds
it
was
full
high
moon
and
the
light
so
clear
that
notwithstanding
the
brightness
of
the
fire
each
window
seemed
to
lie
in
ghostly
shimmer
on
the
floor
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
abroad
the
whole
country
being
covered
with
snow
the
air
was
filled
with
a
snowy
light
on
one
side
rose
the
high
roof
of
another
part
of
the
house
on
which
the
snow
was
lying
thick
and
smooth
undisturbed
save
by
the
footprints
visible
in
the
moon
of
a
large
black
cat
which
had
now
paused
in
the
middle
of
it
and
was
looking
round
suspiciously
towards
the
source
of
the
light
which
had
surprised
him
in
his
midnight
walk
now
said
harry
returning
to
his
seat
and
putting
on
an
air
of
confidence
to
conceal
the
lack
of
it
let
any
one
who
has
nerves
retire
at
once
both
for
his
own
sake
and
that
of
the
company
this
is
just
such
a
night
as
i
wanted

his
manuscript
gummed
together
in
a
continuous
roll
so
that
he
might
not
have
to
turn
over
any
leaves
began
at
once
the
cruel
painter
among
the
young
men
assembled
at
the
university
of
prague
in
the
year
was
one
called
karl
von
wolkenlicht
a
somewhat
careless
student
he
yet
held
a
fair
position
in
the
estimation
of
both
professors
and
men
because
he
could
hardly
look
at
a
proposition
without
understanding
it
where
such
proposition
however
had
to
do
with
anything
relating
to
the
deeper
insights
of
the
nature
he
was
quite
content
that
for
him
it
should
remain
a
proposition
which
however
he
laid
up
in
one
of
his
mental
cabinets
and
was
ready
to
reproduce
at
a
moment
notice
this
mental
agility
was
more
than
matched
by
the
corresponding
corporeal
excellence
and
both
aided
in
producing
results
in
which
his
remarkable
strength
was
equally
apparent
in
all
games
depending
upon
the
combination
of
muscle
and
skill
he
had
scarce
rivalry
enough
to
keep
him
in
practice
his
strength
however
was
embodied
in
such
a
softness
of
muscular
outline
such
a
rare
style
of
beauty
and
associated
with
such
a
gentleness
of
manner
and
behaviour
that
partly
from
the
truth
of
the
resemblance
partly
from
the
absurdity
of
the
contrast
he
was
known
throughout
the
university
by
the
diminutive
of
the
feminine
form
of
his
name
and
was
always
called
lottchen
say
lottchen
said
one
of
his
called
richter
across
the
table
in
a
they
were
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
you
know
heinrich
hoellenrachen
here
says
that
he
saw
this
morning
with
mortal
eyes
whom
do
you
think
lilith
first
wife
asked
lottchen
with
an
attempt
at
carelessness
while
his
face
flushed
like
a
maiden
of
your
chaff
richter
face
is
honester
than
your
tongue
and
confesses
what
you
can
not
deny
that
you
would
give
your
chance
of
salvation
a
small
one
to
be
sure
but
all
you
got
for
one
peep
at
lilith
would
you
now
lottchen
to
the
devil
was
all
lottchen
answer
to
his
tormentor
but
he
turned
to
heinrich
to
whom
the
students
had
given
the
surname
above
mentioned
because
of
the
enormous
width
of
his
jaws
and
said
with
eagerness
and
envy
disguising
them
as
well
as
he
could
under
the
appearance
of
curiosity
do
mean
it
heinrich
you
been
taking
the
beggar
in
confess
now
i
saw
her
with
my
two
eyes
the
different
planes
of
their
orbits
suggested
richter
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
can
get
a
parallax
to
any
of
the
fixed
stars
in
a
moment
with
only
the
breadth
of
my
nose
for
the
base
answered
heinrich
responding
at
once
to
the
fun
and
careless
of
the
personal
defect
insinuated
was
near
enough
for
even
me
to
see
her
perfectly
where
how
asked
lottchen
hours
ago
in
the
churchyard
of
stephen
by
a
lucky
chance
any
more
little
questions
my
child
answered
hoellenrachen
could
have
taken
her
there
who
is
seen
nowhere
said
richter
she
was
seated
on
a
grave
after
she
left
i
went
to
the
place
but
it
was
a
grave
there
was
no
stone
up
i
asked
the
sexton
about
her
he
said
he
supposed
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
woman
buried
there
last
thursday
week
i
knew
it
was
lilith
mother
dead
said
lottchen
musingly
then
he
thought
with
himself
will
be
going
there
again
then
but
he
took
care
that
this
should
wander
unembodied
how
did
you
know
her
heinrich
you
never
saw
her
before
do
you
come
to
be
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
lottchen
and
you
have
seen
her
at
all
interposed
richter
you
or
will
you
not
go
to
the
devil
rejoined
lottchen
with
a
comic
crescendo
to
which
the
other
replied
with
a
laugh
one
could
miss
knowing
her
said
heinrich
she
so
very
like
then
is
always
herself
her
very
self
a
fresh
flask
of
wine
turning
out
to
be
not
up
to
the
mark
brought
the
current
of
conversation
against
itself
not
much
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
lottchen
who
had
already
resolved
to
be
in
the
churchyard
of
stephen
at
the
following
day
in
the
hope
that
he
too
might
be
favoured
with
a
vision
of
lilith
this
resolution
he
carried
out
seated
in
a
porch
of
the
church
not
knowing
in
what
direction
to
look
for
the
apparition
he
hoped
to
see
and
desirous
as
well
of
not
seeming
to
be
on
the
watch
for
one
he
was
gazing
at
the
fallen
of
the
sunset
withering
away
upon
the
sky
when
glancing
aside
by
an
involuntary
movement
he
saw
a
woman
seated
upon
a
grave
not
many
yards
from
where
he
sat
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
and
apparently
weeping
bitterly
karl
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
porch
and
could
see
her
perfectly
without
much
danger
of
being
discovered
by
her
so
he
sat
and
watched
her
she
raised
her
head
for
a
moment
and
the
of
the
west
fell
over
it
shining
on
the
tears
with
which
it
was
wet
and
giving
the
whole
a
bloom
which
did
not
belong
to
it
for
it
was
always
pale
and
now
pale
as
death
it
was
indeed
the
face
of
lilith
the
most
celebrated
beauty
of
prague
again
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
karl
sat
with
a
strange
feeling
of
helplessness
which
grew
as
he
sat
and
the
longing
to
help
her
whom
he
could
not
help
drew
his
heart
towards
her
with
a
trembling
reverence
which
was
quite
new
to
him
she
wept
on
the
western
roses
withered
slowly
away
and
the
clouds
blended
with
the
sky
and
the
stars
gathered
like
drops
of
glory
sinking
through
the
vault
of
night
and
the
trees
about
the
churchyard
grew
black
and
lilith
almost
vanished
in
the
wide
darkness
at
length
she
lifted
her
head
and
seeing
the
night
around
her
gave
a
little
broken
cry
of
dismay
the
minutes
had
swept
over
her
head
not
through
her
mind
and
she
did
not
know
that
the
dark
had
come
hearing
her
cry
karl
rose
and
approached
her
she
heard
his
footsteps
and
started
to
her
feet
karl
spoke
not
be
frightened
he
said
me
see
you
home
i
will
walk
behind
you
are
you
she
rejoined
wolkenlicht
have
heard
of
you
thank
you
i
can
go
home
alone
yet
as
if
in
a
mood
she
accepted
his
offered
hand
to
lead
her
through
the
graves
and
allowed
him
to
walk
beside
her
till
reaching
the
corner
of
a
narrow
street
she
suddenly
bade
him
and
vanished
he
thought
it
better
not
to
follow
her
so
he
returned
her
and
went
home
how
to
see
her
again
was
his
first
thought
the
next
day
as
in
fact
how
to
see
her
at
all
had
been
his
first
thought
for
many
days
she
went
nowhere
that
ever
he
heard
of
she
knew
nobody
that
he
knew
she
was
never
seen
at
church
or
at
market
never
seen
in
the
street
her
home
had
a
dreary
desolate
aspect
it
looked
as
if
no
one
ever
went
out
or
in
it
was
like
a
place
on
which
decay
had
fallen
because
there
was
no
indwelling
spirit
the
mud
of
years
was
baked
upon
its
door
and
no
faces
looked
out
of
its
dusty
windows
how
then
could
she
be
the
most
celebrated
beauty
of
prague
how
then
was
it
that
heinrich
hoellenrachen
knew
her
the
moment
he
saw
her
above
all
how
was
it
that
karl
wolkenlicht
had
in
fact
fallen
in
love
with
her
before
ever
he
saw
her
it
was
thus
her
father
was
a
painter
belonging
thus
to
the
public
it
had
taken
the
liberty
of
him
every
one
called
him
teufelsbuerst
or
devilsbrush
it
was
a
name
with
which
to
judge
from
the
nature
of
his
representations
he
could
hardly
fail
to
be
pleased
for
not
as
a
nightmare
dream
which
may
alternate
with
the
loveliest
visions
but
as
his
ordinary
everyday
work
he
delighted
to
represent
human
suffering
not
an
aspect
of
human
woe
or
torture
as
expressed
in
countenance
or
limb
came
before
his
willing
imagination
but
he
bore
it
straightway
to
his
easel
in
the
moments
that
precede
sleep
when
the
black
space
before
the
eyes
of
the
poet
teems
with
lovely
faces
or
dawns
into
a
face
after
face
of
suffering
in
all
varieties
of
expression
would
crowd
as
if
compelled
by
the
accompanying
fiends
to
present
themselves
in
awful
levee
before
the
inner
eye
of
the
expectant
master
then
he
would
rise
light
his
lamp
and
with
rapid
hand
make
notes
of
his
visions
recording
with
swift
successive
sweeps
of
his
pencil
every
individual
face
which
had
rejoiced
his
evil
fancy
then
he
would
return
to
his
couch
and
well
satisfied
fall
asleep
to
dream
yet
further
embodiments
of
human
what
wrong
could
man
or
mankind
have
done
him
to
be
thus
fearfully
pursued
by
the
vengeance
of
the
artist
hate
another
characteristic
of
the
faces
and
form
which
he
drew
was
that
they
were
all
beautiful
in
the
original
idea
the
lines
of
each
face
however
distorted
by
pain
would
have
been
in
rest
absolutely
beautiful
and
the
whole
of
the
execution
bore
witness
to
the
fact
that
upon
this
original
beauty
the
painter
had
directed
the
artillery
of
anguish
to
bring
down
the
heights
of
its
divinity
to
the
level
of
a
hated
existence
to
do
this
he
worked
in
perfect
accordance
with
artistic
law
falsifying
no
line
of
the
original
forms
it
was
the
suffering
rather
than
his
pencil
that
wrought
the
change
the
latter
was
the
willing
instrument
to
record
what
the
imagination
conceived
with
a
cruelty
composed
enough
to
be
correct
to
enhance
the
beauty
he
had
thus
distorted
and
so
to
enhance
yet
further
the
suffering
that
produced
the
distortion
he
would
often
represent
attendant
demons
whom
he
made
as
ugly
as
his
imagination
could
compass
avoiding
however
all
grotesqueness
beyond
what
was
sufficient
to
indicate
that
they
were
demons
and
not
men
their
ugliness
rose
from
hate
envy
and
all
evil
passions
amongst
which
he
especially
delighted
to
represent
a
gloating
exultation
over
human
distress
and
often
in
the
midst
of
his
clouds
of
demon
faces
would
some
one
who
knew
him
recognise
the
painter
own
likeness
such
as
the
mirror
might
have
presented
it
to
him
when
he
was
busiest
over
the
incarnation
of
some
exquisite
torture
but
apparently
with
the
wish
to
avoid
being
supposed
to
choose
such
representations
for
their
own
sakes
he
always
found
a
story
often
in
the
histories
of
the
church
whose
name
he
gave
to
the
painting
and
which
he
pretended
to
have
inspired
the
pictorial
conception
no
one
however
who
looked
upon
his
suffering
martyrs
could
suppose
for
a
moment
that
he
honoured
their
martyrdom
they
were
but
the
vehicles
for
his
hate
of
humanity
he
was
the
torturer
and
not
diocletian
or
nero
but
stranger
yet
to
tell
there
was
no
picture
whatever
its
subject
into
which
he
did
not
introduce
one
form
of
placid
and
harmonious
loveliness
in
this
however
his
fierceness
was
only
more
fully
displayed
for
in
no
case
did
this
form
manifest
any
relation
either
to
the
actors
or
the
endurers
in
the
picture
hence
its
very
loveliness
became
almost
hateful
to
those
who
beheld
it
not
a
shade
crossed
the
still
sky
of
that
brow
not
a
ripple
disturbed
the
still
sea
of
that
cheek
she
did
not
hate
she
did
not
love
the
sufferers
the
painter
would
not
have
her
hate
for
that
would
be
to
the
injury
of
her
loveliness
would
not
have
her
love
for
he
hated
sometimes
she
floated
above
as
a
still
unobservant
angel
her
gaze
turned
upward
dreaming
along
careless
as
a
white
summer
cloud
across
the
blue
if
she
looked
down
on
the
scene
below
it
was
only
that
the
beholder
might
see
that
she
saw
and
did
not
care
that
not
a
feather
of
her
outspread
pinions
would
quiver
at
the
sight
sometimes
she
would
stand
in
the
crowd
as
if
she
had
been
copied
there
from
another
picture
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
one
nor
any
right
to
be
in
it
at
all
or
when
the
red
blood
was
trickling
drop
by
drop
from
the
crushed
limb
she
might
be
seen
standing
nearest
smiling
over
a
primrose
or
the
bloom
on
a
peach
some
had
said
that
she
was
the
painter
wife
that
she
had
been
false
to
him
that
he
had
killed
her
and
finding
that
that
was
no
sufficing
revenge
thus
half
in
love
and
half
in
deepest
hate
immortalized
his
vengeance
but
it
was
now
universally
understood
that
it
was
his
daughter
of
whose
loveliness
extravagant
reports
went
abroad
though
all
said
doubtless
reading
this
from
her
pictures
that
she
was
a
beauty
without
a
heart
strange
theories
of
something
else
supplying
its
place
were
rife
among
the
anatomical
students
with
the
girl
in
the
pictures
the
wild
imagination
of
lottchen
probably
in
part
from
her
apparently
absolute
unattainableness
and
her
undisputed
heartlessness
had
fallen
in
love
as
far
as
the
mere
imagination
can
fall
in
love
but
again
how
was
he
to
see
her
he
haunted
the
house
night
after
night
those
blue
eyes
never
met
his
no
step
responsive
to
his
came
from
that
door
it
seemed
to
have
been
so
long
unopened
that
it
had
grown
as
fixed
and
hard
as
the
stones
that
held
its
bolts
in
their
passive
clasp
he
dared
not
watch
in
the
daytime
and
with
all
his
watching
at
night
he
never
saw
father
or
daughter
or
domestic
cross
the
threshold
little
he
thought
that
from
a
near
the
door
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
like
lilith
but
paler
and
colder
were
watching
him
just
as
a
spider
watches
the
fly
that
is
likely
ere
long
to
fall
into
his
toils
and
into
those
toils
karl
soon
fell
for
her
form
darkened
the
page
her
form
stood
on
the
threshold
of
sleep
and
when
overcome
with
watching
he
did
enter
its
precincts
her
form
entered
with
him
and
walked
by
his
side
he
must
find
her
or
the
world
might
go
to
the
bottomless
pit
for
him
but
how
yes
he
would
be
a
painter
teufelsbuerst
would
receive
him
as
a
humble
apprentice
he
would
grind
his
colours
and
teufelsbuerst
would
teach
him
the
mysteries
of
the
science
which
is
the
handmaiden
of
art
then
he
might
see
and
that
was
all
his
ambition
in
the
clear
morning
light
of
a
day
in
autumn
when
the
leaves
were
beginning
to
fall
seared
from
the
hand
of
that
death
which
has
his
dance
in
the
chapels
of
nature
as
well
as
in
the
cathedral
aisles
of
men
he
walked
up
and
knocked
at
the
dingy
door
the
spider
painter
opened
it
himself
he
was
a
little
man
meagre
and
pallid
with
those
faded
blue
eyes
a
low
nose
in
three
distinct
divisions
and
thin
curveless
cruel
lips
he
wore
no
hair
on
his
face
but
long
grey
locks
long
as
a
woman
were
scattered
over
his
shoulders
and
hung
down
on
his
breast
when
wolkenlicht
had
explained
his
errand
he
smiled
a
smile
in
which
hypocrisy
could
not
hide
the
cunning
and
after
many
difficulties
consented
to
receive
him
as
a
pupil
on
condition
that
he
would
become
an
inmate
of
his
house
heart
bounded
with
delight
which
he
tried
to
hide
the
second
smile
of
teufelsbuerst
might
have
shown
him
that
he
had
ill
succeeded
the
fact
that
he
was
not
a
native
of
prague
but
coming
from
a
distant
part
of
the
country
was
entirely
his
own
master
in
the
city
rendered
this
condition
perfectly
easy
to
fulfil
and
that
very
afternoon
he
entered
the
studio
of
teufelsbuerst
as
his
scholar
and
servant
it
was
a
great
room
filled
with
the
appliances
and
results
of
art
many
pictures
festooned
with
cobwebs
were
hung
carelessly
on
the
dirty
walls
others
half
finished
leaned
against
them
on
the
floor
several
in
different
stages
of
progress
stood
upon
easels
but
all
spoke
the
cruel
bent
of
the
artist
genius
in
one
corner
a
lay
figure
was
extended
on
a
couch
covered
with
a
pall
of
black
velvet
through
its
folds
the
form
beneath
was
easily
discernible
and
one
hand
and
forearm
protruded
from
beneath
it
at
right
angles
to
the
rest
of
the
frame
lottchen
could
not
help
shuddering
when
he
saw
it
although
he
overcame
the
feeling
in
a
moment
he
felt
a
great
repugnance
to
seating
himself
with
his
back
towards
it
as
the
arrangement
of
an
easel
at
which
teufelsbuerst
wished
him
to
draw
rendered
necessary
he
contrived
to
edge
himself
round
so
that
when
he
lifted
his
eyes
he
should
see
the
figure
and
be
sure
that
it
could
not
rise
without
his
being
aware
of
it
but
his
master
saw
and
understood
his
altered
position
and
under
some
pretence
about
the
light
compelled
him
to
resume
the
position
in
which
he
had
placed
him
at
first
after
which
he
sat
watching
over
the
top
of
his
picture
the
expression
of
his
countenance
as
he
tried
to
draw
reading
in
it
the
horrid
fancy
that
the
figure
under
the
pall
had
risen
and
was
stealthily
approaching
to
look
over
his
shoulder
but
lottchen
resisted
the
feeling
and
being
already
no
contemptible
draughtsman
was
soon
interested
enough
to
forget
it
and
then
any
moment
might
enter
now
began
a
system
of
slow
torture
for
the
chance
of
which
the
painter
had
been
long
on
the
watch
especially
since
he
had
first
seen
karl
lingering
about
the
house
his
opportunities
of
seeing
physical
suffering
were
nearly
enough
even
for
the
diseased
necessities
of
his
art
but
now
he
had
one
in
his
power
on
whom
his
own
will
fettering
him
he
could
try
any
experiments
he
pleased
for
the
production
of
a
kind
of
suffering
in
the
observation
of
which
he
did
not
consider
that
he
had
yet
sufficient
experience
he
would
hold
the
very
heart
of
the
youth
in
his
hand
and
wring
it
and
torture
it
to
his
own
content
and
lest
karl
should
be
strong
enough
to
prevent
those
expressions
of
pain
for
which
he
lay
on
the
watch
he
would
make
use
of
further
means
known
to
himself
and
known
to
few
besides
all
that
day
karl
saw
nothing
of
lilith
but
he
heard
her
voice
once
and
that
was
enough
for
one
day
the
next
she
was
sitting
to
her
father
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
he
could
see
her
as
often
as
he
dared
glance
up
from
his
drawing
she
had
looked
at
him
when
she
entered
but
had
shown
no
sign
of
recognition
and
all
day
long
she
took
no
further
notice
of
him
he
hoped
at
first
that
this
came
of
the
intelligence
of
love
but
he
soon
began
to
doubt
it
for
he
saw
that
with
the
holy
shadow
of
sorrow
all
that
distinguished
the
expression
of
her
countenance
from
that
which
the
painter
so
constantly
reproduced
had
vanished
likewise
it
was
the
very
face
of
the
unheeding
angel
whom
as
often
as
he
lifted
his
eyes
higher
than
hers
he
saw
on
the
wall
above
her
playing
on
a
psaltery
in
the
smoke
of
the
torment
ascending
for
ever
from
burning
the
power
of
the
painter
had
not
merely
wrought
for
the
representation
of
the
woman
of
his
imagination
it
had
had
scope
as
well
in
realizing
her
karl
soon
began
to
see
that
communication
other
than
of
the
eyes
was
all
but
hopeless
and
to
any
attempt
in
that
way
she
seemed
altogether
indisposed
to
respond
nor
if
she
had
wished
it
would
it
have
been
safe
for
as
often
as
he
glanced
towards
her
instead
of
hers
he
met
the
blue
eyes
of
the
painter
gleaming
upon
him
like
winter
lightning
his
tones
his
gestures
his
words
seemed
kind
his
glance
and
his
smile
refused
to
be
disguised
the
first
day
he
dined
alone
in
the
studio
waited
upon
by
an
old
woman
the
next
he
was
admitted
to
the
family
table
with
teufelsbuerst
and
lilith
the
room
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
study
as
far
as
handicraft
directed
by
a
sumptuous
taste
could
construct
a
this
was
one
but
it
seemed
rather
a
paradise
of
demons
for
the
walls
were
covered
with
teufelsbuerst
paintings
during
the
dinner
lilith
gaze
scarcely
met
that
of
wolkenlicht
and
once
or
twice
when
their
eyes
did
meet
her
glance
was
so
perfectly
unconcerned
that
karl
wished
he
might
look
at
her
for
ever
without
the
fear
of
her
looking
at
him
again
she
seemed
like
one
whose
love
had
rushed
out
glowing
with
seraphic
fire
to
be
frozen
to
death
in
a
more
than
wintry
cold
she
now
walked
lonely
without
her
love
in
the
evenings
he
was
expected
to
continue
his
drawing
by
lamplight
and
at
night
he
was
conducted
by
teufelsbuerst
to
his
chamber
not
once
did
he
allow
him
to
proceed
thither
alone
and
not
once
did
he
leave
him
there
without
locking
and
bolting
the
door
on
the
outside
but
he
felt
nothing
except
the
coldness
of
lilith
day
after
day
she
sat
to
her
father
in
every
variety
of
costume
that
could
best
show
the
variety
of
her
beauty
how
much
greater
that
beauty
might
be
if
it
ever
blossomed
into
a
beauty
of
soul
wolkenlicht
never
imagined
for
he
soon
loved
her
enough
to
attribute
to
her
all
the
possibilities
of
her
face
as
actual
possessions
of
her
being
to
account
for
everything
that
seemed
to
contradict
this
perfection
his
brain
was
prolific
in
inventions
till
he
was
compelled
at
last
to
see
that
she
was
in
the
condition
of
a
which
on
the
point
of
blossoming
had
been
chilled
into
a
changeless
bud
by
the
cold
of
an
untimely
frost
for
one
day
after
the
father
and
daughter
had
become
a
little
more
accustomed
to
his
silent
presence
a
conversation
began
between
them
which
went
on
until
he
saw
that
teufelsbuerst
believed
in
nothing
except
his
art
how
much
of
his
feeling
for
that
could
be
dignified
by
the
name
of
belief
seeing
its
objects
were
such
as
they
were
might
have
been
questioned
it
seemed
to
wolkenlicht
to
amount
only
to
this
that
amidst
a
thousand
distastes
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
reproduce
on
the
canvas
the
forms
he
beheld
around
him
modifying
them
to
express
the
prevailing
feelings
of
his
own
mind
a
more
desolate
communication
between
souls
than
that
which
then
passed
between
father
and
daughter
could
hardly
be
imagined
the
father
spoke
of
humanity
and
all
its
experiences
in
a
tone
of
the
bitterest
scorn
he
despised
men
and
himself
amongst
them
and
rejoiced
to
think
that
the
generations
rose
and
vanished
brood
after
brood
as
the
crops
of
corn
grew
and
disappeared
lilith
who
listened
to
it
all
unmoved
taking
only
an
intellectual
interest
in
the
question
remarked
that
even
the
corn
had
more
life
than
that
for
after
its
death
it
rose
again
in
the
new
crop
whether
she
meant
that
the
corn
was
therefore
superior
to
man
forgetting
that
the
superior
can
produce
being
without
losing
its
own
or
only
advanced
an
objection
to
her
father
argument
wolkenlicht
could
not
tell
but
teufelsbuerst
laughed
like
the
sound
of
a
saw
and
said
out
the
analogy
my
lilith
and
you
will
see
that
man
is
like
the
corn
that
springs
again
after
it
is
buried
but
unfortunately
the
only
result
we
know
of
is
a
vampire
wolkenlicht
looked
up
and
saw
a
shudder
pass
through
the
frame
and
over
the
pale
thin
face
of
the
painter
this
he
could
not
account
for
but
teufelsbuerst
could
have
explained
it
for
there
were
strange
whispers
abroad
and
they
had
reached
his
ear
and
his
philosophy
was
not
quite
enough
for
them
but
the
laugh
with
which
lilith
met
this
frightful
attempt
at
wit
grated
dreadfully
on
wolkenlicht
feeling
with
her
too
however
a
reaction
seemed
to
follow
for
turning
round
a
moment
after
and
looking
at
the
picture
on
which
her
father
was
working
the
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
and
she
said
father
how
like
my
mother
you
have
made
me
this
time
retorted
the
painter
with
a
cold
fierceness
have
no
mother
that
which
is
gone
out
is
gone
out
put
no
name
in
my
hearing
on
that
which
is
not
where
no
substance
is
how
can
there
be
a
name
lilith
rose
and
left
the
room
wolkenlicht
now
understood
that
lilith
was
a
frozen
bud
and
could
not
blossom
into
a
rose
but
pure
love
lives
by
faith
it
loves
the
vaguely
beheld
and
unrealized
ideal
it
dares
believe
that
the
loved
is
not
all
that
she
ever
seemed
it
is
in
virtue
of
this
that
love
loves
on
and
it
was
in
virtue
of
this
that
wolkenlicht
loved
lilith
yet
more
after
he
discovered
what
a
grave
of
misery
her
unbelief
was
digging
for
her
within
her
own
soul
for
her
sake
he
would
bear
anything
bear
even
with
calmness
the
torments
of
his
own
love
he
would
stay
on
hoping
and
the
text
that
we
know
not
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
is
just
as
true
of
good
things
as
of
evil
things
and
out
of
time
womb
the
facts
must
come
but
with
the
birth
of
this
resolution
to
endure
his
suffering
abated
his
face
grew
more
calm
his
love
no
less
earnest
was
less
imperious
and
he
did
not
look
up
so
often
from
his
work
when
lilith
was
present
the
master
could
see
that
his
pupil
was
more
at
ease
and
that
he
was
making
rapid
progress
in
his
art
this
did
not
suit
his
designs
and
he
would
betake
himself
to
his
further
schemes
for
this
purpose
he
proceeded
first
to
simulate
a
friendship
for
wolkenlicht
the
manifestations
of
which
he
gradually
increased
until
after
a
day
or
two
he
asked
him
to
drink
wine
with
him
in
the
evening
karl
readily
agreed
the
painter
produced
some
of
his
best
but
took
care
not
to
allow
lilith
to
taste
it
for
he
had
cunningly
prepared
and
mingled
with
it
a
decoction
of
certain
herbs
and
other
ingredients
exercising
specific
actions
upon
the
brain
and
tending
to
the
inordinate
excitement
of
those
portions
of
it
which
are
principally
under
the
rule
of
the
imagination
by
the
reaction
of
the
brain
during
the
operation
of
these
stimulants
the
imagination
is
filled
with
suggestions
and
images
the
nature
of
these
is
determined
by
the
prevailing
mood
of
the
time
they
are
such
as
the
imagination
would
produce
of
itself
but
increased
in
number
and
intensity
teufelsbuerst
without
philosophizing
about
it
called
his
preparation
simply
a
a
concoction
well
known
by
name
but
the
composition
of
which
was
the
secret
of
only
a
few
wolkenlicht
had
of
course
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
treatment
to
which
he
was
subjected
teufelsbuerst
was
however
doomed
to
fresh
disappointment
not
that
his
potion
failed
in
the
anticipated
effect
for
now
karl
real
sufferings
began
but
that
such
was
the
strength
of
karl
will
and
his
fear
of
doing
anything
that
might
give
a
pretext
for
banishing
him
from
the
presence
of
lilith
that
he
was
able
to
conceal
his
feelings
far
too
successfully
for
the
satisfaction
of
teufelsbuerst
art
yet
he
had
to
fetter
himself
with
all
the
restraints
that
could
load
him
with
to
refrain
from
falling
at
the
feet
of
lilith
and
kissing
the
hem
of
her
garment
for
that
as
the
lowliest
part
of
all
that
surrounded
her
itself
kissing
the
earth
seemed
to
come
nearest
within
the
reach
of
his
ambition
and
therefore
to
draw
him
the
most
no
doubt
the
painter
had
experience
and
penetration
enough
to
perceive
that
he
was
suffering
intensely
but
he
wanted
to
see
the
suffering
embodied
in
outward
signs
bringing
it
within
the
region
over
which
his
pencil
held
sway
he
kept
on
therefore
trying
one
thing
after
another
and
rousing
the
poor
youth
to
agony
till
to
his
other
sufferings
were
added
at
length
those
of
failing
health
a
fact
which
notified
itself
evidently
enough
even
for
teufelsbuerst
though
its
signs
were
not
of
the
sort
he
chiefly
desired
but
karl
endured
all
bravely
meantime
for
various
reasons
he
scarcely
ever
left
the
house
i
must
now
interrupt
the
course
of
my
story
to
introduce
another
element
a
few
years
before
the
period
of
my
tale
a
certain
shoemaker
of
the
city
had
died
under
circumstances
more
than
suggestive
of
suicide
he
was
buried
however
with
such
precautions
that
six
weeks
elapsed
before
the
rumour
of
the
facts
broke
out
upon
which
rumour
not
before
the
most
fearful
reports
began
to
be
circulated
supported
by
what
seemed
to
the
people
of
prague
incontestable
a
of
the
deceased
appeared
to
multitudes
of
persons
playing
horrible
pranks
and
occasioning
indescribable
consternation
throughout
the
whole
town
this
went
on
till
at
last
about
eight
months
after
his
burial
the
magistrates
caused
his
body
to
be
dug
up
when
it
was
found
in
just
the
condition
of
the
bodies
of
those
who
in
the
eastern
countries
of
europe
are
called
they
buried
the
corpse
under
the
gallows
but
neither
the
digging
up
nor
the
were
of
avail
to
banish
the
spectre
again
the
spade
and
were
set
to
work
and
the
dead
man
being
found
considerably
improved
in
since
his
last
interment
was
with
various
horrible
indignities
burnt
to
ashes
which
the
was
never
seen
more
and
a
second
epidemic
of
the
same
nature
had
broken
out
a
little
before
the
period
to
which
i
have
brought
my
story
about
midnight
after
a
calm
frosty
day
for
it
was
now
winter
a
terrible
storm
of
wind
and
snow
came
on
the
tempest
howled
frightfully
about
the
house
of
the
painter
and
wolkenlicht
found
some
solace
in
listening
to
the
uproar
for
his
troubled
thoughts
would
not
allow
him
to
sleep
it
raged
on
all
the
next
three
days
till
about
noon
on
the
fourth
day
when
it
suddenly
fell
and
all
was
calm
the
following
night
wolkenlicht
lying
awake
heard
unaccountable
noises
in
the
next
house
as
of
things
thrown
about
of
kicking
and
fighting
horses
and
of
opening
and
shutting
gates
flinging
wide
his
lattice
and
looking
out
the
noise
of
howling
dogs
came
to
him
from
every
quarter
of
the
town
the
moon
was
bright
and
the
air
was
still
in
a
little
while
he
heard
the
sounds
of
a
horse
going
at
full
gallop
round
the
house
so
that
it
shook
as
if
it
would
fall
and
flashes
of
light
shone
into
his
room
how
much
of
this
may
have
been
owing
to
the
effect
of
the
drugs
on
poor
lottchen
brain
i
leave
my
readers
to
determine
but
when
the
family
met
at
breakfast
in
the
morning
teufelsbuerst
who
had
been
already
out
of
doors
reported
that
he
had
found
the
marks
of
strange
feet
in
the
snow
all
about
the
house
and
through
the
garden
at
the
back
stating
as
his
belief
that
the
tracks
must
be
continued
over
the
roofs
for
there
was
no
passage
otherwise
there
was
a
wicked
gleam
in
his
eye
as
he
spoke
and
lilith
believed
that
he
was
only
trying
an
experiment
on
karl
nerves
he
persisted
that
he
had
never
seen
any
footprints
of
the
sort
before
karl
informed
him
of
his
experiences
during
the
night
upon
which
teufelsbuerst
looked
a
little
graver
still
and
proceeded
to
tell
them
that
the
storm
whose
snow
was
still
covering
the
ground
had
arisen
the
very
moment
that
their
next
door
neighbour
died
and
had
ceased
as
suddenly
the
moment
he
was
buried
though
it
had
raved
furiously
all
the
time
of
the
funeral
so
that
made
men
bodies
quake
and
their
teeth
chatter
in
their
heads
karl
had
heard
that
the
man
whose
name
was
john
kuntz
was
dead
and
buried
he
knew
that
he
had
been
a
very
wealthy
and
therefore
most
respectable
alderman
of
the
town
that
he
had
been
very
fond
of
horses
and
that
he
had
died
in
consequence
of
a
kick
received
from
one
of
his
own
as
he
was
looking
at
his
hoof
but
he
had
not
heard
that
just
before
he
died
a
black
cat
the
casement
with
her
nails
ran
to
his
bed
and
violently
scratched
his
face
and
the
bolster
as
if
she
endeavoured
by
force
to
remove
him
out
of
the
place
where
he
lay
but
the
cat
afterwards
was
suddenly
gone
and
she
was
no
sooner
gone
but
he
breathed
his
last
so
said
teufelsbuerst
as
the
reporter
of
the
town
talk
lilith
looked
very
pale
and
terrified
and
it
was
perhaps
owing
to
this
that
the
painter
brought
no
more
tales
home
with
him
there
were
plenty
to
bring
but
he
heard
them
all
and
said
nothing
the
fact
was
that
the
philosopher
himself
could
not
resist
the
infection
of
the
fear
that
was
literally
raging
in
the
city
and
perhaps
the
reports
that
he
himself
had
sold
himself
to
the
devil
had
sufficient
response
from
his
own
evil
conscience
to
add
to
the
influence
of
the
epidemic
upon
him
the
whole
place
was
infested
with
the
presence
of
the
dead
kuntz
till
scarce
a
man
or
woman
would
dare
to
be
alone
he
strangled
old
men
insulted
women
squeezed
children
to
death
knocked
out
the
brains
of
dogs
against
the
ground
pulled
up
posts
turned
milk
into
blood
nearly
killed
a
worthy
clergyman
by
breathing
upon
him
the
intolerable
airs
of
the
grave
cold
and
malignant
and
noisome
and
in
short
filled
the
city
with
a
perfect
madness
of
fear
so
that
every
report
was
believed
without
the
smallest
doubt
or
investigation
though
teufelsbuerst
brought
home
no
more
of
the
town
talk
the
old
servant
was
a
faithful
purveyor
and
frequented
the
assiduously
indeed
she
had
some
nightmare
experiences
of
her
own
that
she
was
proud
to
add
to
the
stock
of
horrors
which
the
city
enjoyed
with
such
a
hearty
community
of
goods
for
those
regions
were
not
far
removed
from
the
birthplace
and
home
of
the
vampire
the
belief
in
vampires
is
the
quintessential
concentration
and
embodiment
of
all
the
passion
of
fear
in
hungary
and
the
adjacent
regions
nor
of
all
the
other
inventions
of
the
human
imagination
has
there
ever
been
one
so
perfect
in
crawling
terror
as
this
lilith
and
karl
were
quite
familiar
with
the
popular
ideas
on
the
subject
it
did
not
require
to
be
explained
to
them
that
a
vampire
was
a
body
retaining
a
kind
of
animal
life
after
the
soul
had
departed
if
any
relation
existed
between
it
and
the
vanished
ghost
it
was
only
sufficient
to
make
it
restless
in
its
grave
possessed
of
vitality
enough
to
keep
it
uncorrupted
and
pliant
its
only
instinct
was
a
blind
hunger
for
the
sole
food
which
could
keep
its
awful
life
persistent
living
human
blood
hence
it
or
if
not
it
a
sort
of
exhalation
or
essence
of
it
retaining
its
form
and
material
relations
crept
from
its
tomb
and
went
roaming
about
till
it
found
some
one
asleep
towards
whom
it
had
an
attraction
founded
on
old
affection
it
sucked
the
blood
of
this
unhappy
being
transferring
so
much
of
its
life
to
itself
as
a
vampire
could
assimilate
death
was
the
certain
consequence
if
suspicion
conjectured
aright
and
they
opened
the
proper
grave
the
body
of
the
vampire
would
be
found
perfectly
fresh
and
plump
sometimes
indeed
of
rather
florid
complexion
with
grown
hair
eyes
half
open
and
the
stains
of
recent
blood
about
its
greedy
lips
nothing
remained
but
to
consume
the
corpse
to
ashes
upon
which
the
vampire
would
show
itself
no
more
but
what
added
infinitely
to
the
horror
was
the
certainty
that
whoever
died
from
the
mouth
of
the
vampire
wrinkled
grandsire
or
delicate
maiden
must
in
turn
rise
from
the
grave
and
go
forth
a
vampire
to
suck
the
blood
of
the
dearest
left
behind
this
was
the
generation
of
the
vampire
brood
lilith
trembled
at
the
very
name
of
the
creature
karl
was
too
much
in
love
to
be
afraid
of
anything
yet
the
evident
fear
of
the
unbelieving
painter
took
a
hold
of
his
imagination
and
under
the
influence
of
the
potions
of
which
he
still
partook
unwittingly
when
he
was
not
thinking
about
lilith
he
was
thinking
about
the
vampire
meantime
the
condition
of
things
in
the
painter
household
continued
much
the
same
for
wolkenlicht
work
all
day
no
communication
between
the
young
people
the
dinner
and
the
wine
silent
reading
when
work
was
done
with
stolen
glances
many
over
the
top
of
the
book
glances
that
were
never
returned
the
cold
the
locking
of
the
door
the
wakeful
night
and
the
drowsy
morning
but
at
length
a
change
came
and
sooner
than
any
of
the
party
had
expected
for
whether
it
was
that
the
impatience
of
teufelsbuerst
had
urged
him
to
yet
more
dangerous
experiments
or
that
the
continuance
of
those
he
had
been
so
long
employing
had
overcome
at
length
the
vitality
of
wolkenlicht
one
afternoon
as
he
was
sitting
at
his
work
he
suddenly
dropped
from
his
chair
and
his
master
hurrying
to
him
in
some
alarm
found
him
rigid
and
apparently
lifeless
lilith
was
not
in
the
study
when
this
took
place
in
justice
to
teufelsbuerst
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
employed
all
the
skill
he
was
master
of
which
for
beneficent
purposes
was
not
very
great
to
restore
the
youth
but
without
avail
at
last
hearing
the
footsteps
of
lilith
he
desisted
in
some
consternation
and
that
she
might
escape
being
shocked
by
the
sight
of
a
dead
body
where
she
had
been
accustomed
to
see
a
living
one
he
removed
the
lay
figure
from
the
couch
and
laid
karl
in
its
place
covering
him
with
a
black
velvet
pall
he
was
just
in
time
she
started
at
seeing
no
one
in
karl
place
and
said
is
your
pupil
father
home
he
answered
with
a
kind
of
convulsive
grin
she
glanced
round
the
room
caught
sight
of
the
lay
figure
where
it
had
not
been
before
looked
at
the
couch
and
saw
the
pall
yet
heaved
up
from
beneath
opened
her
eyes
till
the
entire
white
sweep
around
the
iris
suggested
a
new
expression
of
consternation
to
teufelsbuerst
though
from
a
quarter
whence
he
did
not
desire
or
look
for
it
and
then
without
a
word
sat
down
to
a
drawing
she
had
been
busy
upon
the
day
before
but
her
father
glancing
at
her
now
as
wolkenlicht
had
used
to
do
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
was
frightfully
pale
she
showed
no
other
sign
of
uneasiness
as
soon
as
he
released
her
she
withdrew
with
one
more
glance
as
she
passed
at
the
couch
and
the
figure
blocked
out
in
black
upon
it
she
hastened
to
her
chamber
shut
and
locked
the
door
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
couch
and
fell
not
but
was
he
dead
what
did
it
matter
they
would
all
be
dead
soon
her
mother
was
dead
already
it
was
only
that
the
earth
could
not
bear
more
children
except
she
devoured
those
to
whom
she
had
already
given
birth
but
what
if
they
had
to
come
back
in
another
form
and
live
another
sad
hopeless
loveless
life
over
again
and
so
she
went
on
questioning
and
receiving
no
replies
while
through
all
her
thoughts
passed
and
repassed
the
eyes
of
wolkenlicht
which
she
had
often
felt
to
be
upon
her
when
she
did
not
see
them
wild
with
repressed
longing
the
light
of
their
love
shining
through
the
veil
of
diffused
tears
ever
gathering
and
never
overflowing
then
came
the
pale
face
so
worshipping
so
distant
in
its
devotion
slowly
dawning
out
of
the
vapours
of
her
reverie
when
it
vanished
she
tried
to
see
it
again
it
would
not
come
when
she
called
it
but
when
her
thoughts
left
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
lost
and
wandered
away
out
came
the
pale
troubled
silent
face
again
gathering
itself
up
from
some
unknown
nook
in
her
world
of
phantasy
and
once
more
when
she
tried
to
steady
it
by
the
fixedness
of
her
own
regard
fading
back
into
the
mist
so
the
phantasm
of
the
dead
drew
near
and
wooed
as
the
living
had
never
what
if
there
were
any
good
in
loving
what
if
men
and
women
did
not
die
all
out
but
some
dim
shade
of
each
like
that
pale
of
wolkenlicht
floated
through
the
eternal
vapours
of
chaos
and
what
if
they
might
sometimes
cross
each
other
path
meet
know
that
they
met
love
on
would
not
that
revive
the
withered
memory
fix
the
fleeting
ghost
give
a
new
habitation
a
body
even
to
the
poor
unhoused
wanderers
frozen
by
the
eternal
frosts
no
longer
thinking
beings
but
thoughts
wandering
through
the
brain
of
the
mass
back
with
the
thought
came
the
face
of
the
dead
karl
and
the
maiden
threw
herself
on
her
bed
in
a
flood
of
bitter
tears
she
could
have
loved
him
if
he
had
only
lived
she
did
love
him
for
he
was
dead
but
even
in
the
midst
of
the
remorse
that
followed
for
had
she
not
killed
him
life
seemed
a
less
hard
and
hopeless
thing
than
before
for
it
is
love
itself
and
not
its
responses
or
results
that
is
the
soul
of
life
and
its
pleasures
two
hours
passed
ere
she
could
again
show
herself
to
her
father
from
whom
she
seemed
in
some
new
way
divided
by
the
new
feeling
in
which
he
did
not
and
could
not
share
but
at
last
lest
he
should
seek
her
and
finding
her
should
suspect
her
thoughts
she
descended
and
sought
for
there
is
a
maidenliness
in
sorrow
that
wraps
her
garments
close
around
but
he
was
not
to
be
seen
the
door
of
the
study
was
locked
a
shudder
passed
through
her
as
she
thought
of
what
her
father
who
lost
no
opportunity
of
furthering
his
all
but
perfect
acquaintance
with
the
human
form
and
structure
might
be
about
with
the
figure
which
she
knew
lay
dead
beneath
that
velvet
pall
but
which
had
arisen
to
haunt
the
hollow
caves
and
cells
of
her
living
brain
she
rushed
away
and
up
once
more
to
her
silent
room
through
the
darkness
which
had
now
settled
down
in
the
house
threw
herself
again
on
her
bed
and
lay
almost
paralysed
with
horror
and
distress
but
teufelsbuerst
was
not
about
anything
so
frightful
as
she
supposed
though
something
frightful
enough
i
have
already
implied
that
wolkenlicht
was
in
form
as
fine
an
embodiment
of
youthful
manhood
as
any
old
greek
republic
could
have
provided
one
of
its
sculptors
with
as
model
for
an
apollo
it
is
true
that
to
the
eye
of
a
greek
artist
he
would
not
have
been
more
acceptable
in
consequence
of
the
regimen
he
had
been
going
through
for
the
last
few
weeks
but
the
emaciation
of
wolkenlicht
frame
and
the
consequent
prominence
of
the
muscles
indicating
the
pain
he
had
gone
through
were
peculiarly
attractive
to
he
was
busy
preparing
to
take
a
cast
of
the
body
of
his
dead
pupil
that
it
might
aid
to
the
perfection
of
his
future
labours
he
was
deep
in
the
artistic
enjoyment
of
a
form
at
the
same
time
so
beautiful
and
strong
yet
with
the
lines
of
suffering
in
every
limb
and
feature
when
his
daughter
hand
was
laid
on
the
latch
he
started
flung
the
velvet
drapery
over
the
body
and
went
to
the
door
but
lilith
had
vanished
he
returned
to
his
labours
the
operation
took
a
long
time
for
he
performed
it
very
carefully
towards
midnight
he
had
finished
encasing
the
body
in
a
shell
of
plaster
which
when
broken
off
and
fitted
together
would
be
the
matrix
to
the
form
of
the
dead
wolkenlicht
before
leaving
it
to
harden
till
the
morning
he
was
just
proceeding
to
strengthen
it
with
an
additional
layer
all
over
when
a
flash
of
lightning
reflected
in
all
its
dazzle
from
the
snow
without
almost
blinded
him
a
peal
of
thunder
followed
the
wind
rose
and
just
such
a
storm
came
on
as
had
risen
some
time
before
at
the
death
of
kuntz
whose
spectre
was
still
tormenting
the
city
the
gnomes
of
terror
deep
hidden
in
the
caverns
of
teufelsbuerst
nature
broke
out
jubilant
with
trembling
hands
he
tried
to
cast
the
pall
over
the
awful
white
chrysalis
failed
and
fled
to
his
chamber
and
there
lay
the
studio
naked
to
the
eyes
of
the
lightning
with
its
tortured
forms
throbbing
out
of
the
dark
and
quivering
as
with
life
in
the
almost
continuous
palpitations
of
the
light
while
on
the
couch
lay
the
motionless
mass
of
whiteness
gleaming
blue
in
the
lightning
almost
more
terrible
in
its
crude
indications
of
the
human
form
than
that
which
it
enclosed
it
lay
there
as
if
dropped
from
some
tree
of
chaos
haggard
with
the
snows
of
eternity
a
huge
misshapen
nut
with
a
corpse
for
its
kernel
but
the
lightning
would
soon
have
revealed
a
more
terrible
sight
still
had
there
been
any
eyes
to
behold
it
at
midnight
while
a
peal
of
thunder
was
just
dying
away
in
the
distance
the
crust
of
death
flew
asunder
rending
in
all
directions
and
pale
as
his
investiture
staring
with
ghastly
eyes
the
form
of
karl
started
up
sitting
on
the
couch
had
he
not
been
far
beyond
ordinary
men
in
strength
he
could
not
thus
have
rent
his
sepulchre
indeed
had
teufelsbuerst
been
able
to
finish
his
task
by
the
additional
layer
of
gypsum
which
he
contemplated
he
must
have
died
the
moment
life
revived
although
so
long
as
the
trance
lasted
neither
the
exclusion
from
the
air
nor
the
practical
solidification
of
the
walls
of
his
chest
could
do
him
any
injury
he
had
lain
unconscious
throughout
the
operations
of
teufelsbuerst
but
now
the
catalepsy
had
passed
away
possibly
under
the
influence
of
the
electric
condition
of
the
atmosphere
very
likely
the
strength
he
now
put
forth
was
intensified
by
a
convulsive
reaction
of
all
the
powers
of
life
as
is
not
infrequently
the
case
in
sudden
awakenings
from
similar
interruptions
of
vital
activity
the
coming
to
himself
and
the
bursting
of
his
case
were
simultaneous
he
sat
staring
about
him
with
of
all
his
mental
faculties
only
his
imagination
awake
from
which
the
thoughts
that
occupied
it
when
he
fell
senseless
had
not
yet
faded
these
thoughts
had
been
compounded
of
feelings
about
lilith
and
speculations
about
the
vampire
that
haunted
the
neighbourhood
and
the
fumes
of
the
last
drug
of
which
he
had
partaken
still
hovering
in
his
brain
combined
with
these
thoughts
and
fancies
to
generate
the
delusion
that
he
had
just
broken
from
the
embrace
of
his
coffin
and
risen
the
of
the
vampire
race
the
sense
of
unavoidable
obligation
to
fulfil
his
doom
was
yet
mingled
with
a
faint
flutter
of
joy
for
he
knew
that
he
must
go
to
lilith
with
a
deep
sigh
he
rose
gathered
up
the
pall
of
black
velvet
flung
it
around
him
stepped
from
the
couch
and
left
the
study
to
find
her
meantime
teufelsbuerst
had
sufficiently
recovered
to
remember
that
he
had
left
the
door
of
the
studio
unfastened
and
that
any
one
entering
would
discover
in
what
he
had
been
engaged
which
in
the
case
of
his
getting
into
any
difficulty
about
the
death
of
karl
would
tell
powerfully
against
him
he
was
at
the
farther
end
of
a
long
passage
leading
from
the
house
to
the
studio
on
his
way
to
make
all
secure
when
karl
appeared
at
the
door
and
advanced
towards
him
the
painter
seized
with
invincible
terror
turned
and
fled
he
reached
his
room
and
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
the
phantom
held
on
its
way
heedless
lilith
on
gaining
her
room
the
second
time
had
thrown
herself
on
her
bed
as
before
and
had
wept
herself
into
a
troubled
slumber
she
lay
dreaming
and
dreadful
dreams
suddenly
she
awoke
in
one
of
those
peals
of
thunder
which
tormented
the
high
regions
of
the
air
as
a
storm
billows
the
surface
of
the
ocean
she
lay
awake
and
listened
as
it
died
away
she
thought
she
heard
mingling
with
its
last
muffled
murmurs
the
sound
of
moaning
she
turned
her
face
towards
the
room
in
keen
terror
but
she
saw
nothing
another
light
sigh
reached
her
ear
and
at
the
same
moment
a
flash
of
lightning
illumined
the
room
in
the
corner
farthest
from
her
bed
she
spied
a
white
face
nothing
more
she
was
dumb
and
motionless
with
fear
utter
darkness
followed
a
darkness
that
seemed
to
enter
into
her
very
brain
yet
she
felt
that
the
face
was
slowly
crossing
the
black
gulf
of
the
room
and
drawing
near
to
where
she
lay
the
next
flash
revealed
as
it
bended
over
her
the
ghastly
face
of
karl
down
which
flowed
fresh
tears
the
rest
of
his
form
was
lost
in
blackness
lilith
did
not
faint
but
it
was
the
very
force
of
her
fear
that
seemed
to
keep
her
alive
it
became
for
the
moment
the
atmosphere
of
her
life
she
lay
trembling
and
staring
at
the
spot
in
the
darkness
where
she
supposed
the
face
of
karl
still
to
be
but
the
next
flash
showed
her
the
face
far
off
looking
at
her
through
the
panes
of
her
for
lottchen
as
soon
as
he
saw
lilith
seemed
to
himself
to
go
through
a
second
stage
of
awaking
her
face
made
him
doubt
whether
he
could
be
a
vampire
after
all
for
instead
of
wanting
to
bite
her
arm
and
suck
the
blood
he
all
but
fell
down
at
her
feet
in
a
passion
of
speechless
love
the
next
moment
he
became
aware
that
his
presence
must
be
at
least
very
undesirable
to
her
and
in
an
instant
he
had
reached
her
window
which
he
knew
looked
upon
a
lower
roof
that
extended
between
two
different
parts
of
the
house
and
before
the
next
flash
came
he
had
stepped
through
the
lattice
and
closed
it
behind
him
believing
his
own
room
to
be
attainable
from
this
quarter
he
proceeded
along
the
roof
in
the
direction
he
judged
best
the
cold
winter
air
by
degrees
restored
him
entirely
to
his
right
mind
and
he
soon
comprehended
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
in
which
he
found
himself
peeping
through
a
window
he
was
passing
to
see
whether
it
belonged
to
his
room
he
spied
teufelsbuerst
who
at
the
very
moment
was
lifting
his
head
from
the
faint
into
which
he
had
fallen
at
the
first
sight
of
lottchen
the
moon
was
shining
clear
and
in
its
light
the
painter
saw
to
his
horror
the
pale
face
staring
in
at
his
window
he
thought
it
had
been
there
ever
since
he
had
fainted
and
dropped
again
in
a
deeper
swoon
than
before
karl
saw
him
fall
and
the
truth
flashed
upon
him
that
the
wicked
artist
took
him
for
what
he
had
believed
himself
to
be
when
first
he
recovered
from
his
trance
namely
the
vampire
of
the
former
karl
wolkenlicht
the
moment
he
comprehended
it
he
resolved
to
keep
up
the
delusion
if
possible
meantime
he
was
innocently
preparing
a
new
ingredient
for
the
popular
dish
of
horrors
to
be
served
at
the
ordinary
of
the
city
the
next
day
for
the
old
servant
were
not
the
only
eyes
that
had
seen
him
besides
those
of
teufelsbuerst
what
could
be
more
like
a
vampire
dragging
his
pall
after
him
than
this
apparition
of
poor
lottchen
crawling
across
the
roof
karl
remembered
afterwards
that
he
had
heard
the
dogs
howling
awfully
in
every
direction
as
he
crept
along
but
this
was
hardly
necessary
to
make
those
who
saw
him
conclude
that
it
was
the
same
phantasm
of
john
kuntz
which
had
been
infesting
the
whole
city
and
especially
the
house
next
door
to
the
painter
which
had
been
the
dwelling
of
the
respectable
alderman
who
had
degenerated
into
this
most
disreputable
of
moneyless
vagabonds
what
added
to
the
consternation
of
all
who
heard
of
it
was
the
sickening
conviction
that
the
extreme
measures
which
they
had
resorted
to
in
order
to
free
the
city
from
the
ghoul
beyond
which
nothing
could
be
done
had
been
utterly
unavailing
successful
as
they
had
proved
in
every
other
known
case
of
the
kind
for
urged
as
well
by
various
horrid
signs
about
his
grave
which
not
even
its
close
proximity
to
the
altar
could
render
a
place
of
repose
they
had
opened
it
had
found
in
the
body
every
peculiarity
belonging
to
a
vampire
had
pulled
it
out
with
the
greatest
difficulty
on
account
of
a
quite
supernatural
ponderosity
which
rendered
the
horse
which
had
killed
him
a
strong
animal
all
but
unable
to
drag
it
along
and
had
at
last
after
cutting
it
in
pieces
and
expending
on
the
fire
two
hundred
and
sixteen
great
billets
succeeded
in
conquering
its
incombustibleness
and
reducing
it
to
ashes
such
at
least
was
the
story
which
had
reached
the
painter
household
and
was
believed
by
many
and
if
all
this
did
not
compel
the
perturbed
corpse
to
rest
what
more
could
be
done
when
karl
had
reached
his
room
and
was
dressing
himself
the
thought
struck
him
that
something
might
be
made
of
the
report
of
the
extreme
weight
of
the
body
of
old
kuntz
to
favour
the
continuance
of
the
delusion
of
teufelsbuerst
although
he
hardly
knew
yet
to
what
use
he
could
turn
this
delusion
he
was
convinced
that
he
would
have
made
no
progress
however
long
he
might
have
remained
in
his
house
and
that
he
would
have
more
chance
of
favour
with
lilith
if
he
were
to
meet
her
in
any
other
circumstances
whatever
than
those
in
which
he
invariably
saw
her
namely
surrounded
by
her
father
influences
and
watched
by
her
father
cold
blue
eyes
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
he
crept
down
to
the
studio
which
was
now
quiet
enough
the
storm
being
over
and
the
moon
filling
it
with
her
steady
shine
in
the
corner
lay
in
all
directions
the
fragments
of
the
mould
which
his
own
body
had
formed
and
filled
the
bag
of
plaster
and
the
bucket
of
water
which
the
painter
had
been
using
stood
beside
lottchen
gathered
all
the
pieces
together
and
then
making
his
way
to
an
outhouse
where
he
had
seen
various
odds
and
ends
of
rubbish
lying
chose
from
the
heap
as
many
pieces
of
old
iron
and
other
metal
as
he
could
find
to
these
he
added
a
few
large
stones
from
the
garden
when
he
had
got
all
into
the
studio
he
locked
the
door
and
proceeded
to
fit
together
the
parts
of
the
mould
filling
up
the
hollow
as
he
went
on
with
the
heaviest
things
he
could
get
into
it
and
solidifying
the
whole
by
pouring
in
plaster
till
having
at
length
completed
it
and
obliterated
as
much
as
possible
the
marks
of
joining
he
left
it
to
harden
with
the
conviction
that
now
it
would
make
a
considerable
impression
on
teufelsbuerst
imagination
as
well
as
on
his
muscular
sense
he
then
left
everything
else
as
nearly
undisturbed
as
he
could
and
knowing
all
the
ways
of
the
house
was
soon
in
the
street
without
leaving
any
signs
of
his
exit
karl
soon
found
himself
before
the
house
in
which
his
friend
hoellenrachen
resided
knowing
his
studious
habits
he
had
hoped
to
see
his
light
still
burning
nor
was
he
disappointed
he
contrived
to
bring
him
to
his
window
and
a
moment
after
the
door
was
cautiously
opened
lottchen
where
do
you
come
from
the
grave
heinrich
or
next
door
to
it
in
and
tell
me
all
about
it
we
thought
the
old
painter
had
made
a
model
of
you
and
tortured
you
to
death
you
were
not
far
wrong
but
get
me
a
horn
of
ale
for
even
a
vampire
is
thirsty
you
know
vampire
exclaimed
heinrich
retreating
a
pace
and
involuntarily
putting
himself
upon
his
guard
karl
laughed
hand
was
warm
was
it
not
old
fellow
he
said
vampires
are
cold
all
but
the
blood
a
fool
i
am
rejoined
heinrich
you
know
we
have
been
hearing
such
horrors
lately
that
a
fellow
may
be
excused
for
shuddering
a
little
when
a
apparition
tells
him
at
two
in
the
morning
that
he
is
a
vampire
and
thirsty
too
karl
told
him
the
whole
story
and
the
mental
process
of
regarding
it
for
the
sake
of
telling
it
revealed
to
him
pretty
clearly
some
of
the
treatment
of
which
he
had
been
unconscious
at
the
time
heinrich
was
quite
sure
that
his
suspicions
were
correct
and
now
the
question
was
what
was
to
be
done
next
all
events
said
heinrich
must
keep
you
out
of
the
way
for
some
time
i
will
represent
to
my
landlady
that
you
are
in
hiding
from
enemies
and
her
heart
will
rule
her
tongue
she
can
let
you
have
a
i
know
and
i
will
do
as
well
as
i
can
to
bear
you
company
we
shall
have
time
then
to
invent
some
plan
of
operation
to
this
proposal
karl
agreed
with
hearty
thanks
and
soon
all
was
arranged
the
only
conclusion
they
could
yet
arrive
at
was
that
somehow
or
other
the
old
must
be
tamed
meantime
how
fared
it
with
lilith
she
too
had
no
doubt
that
she
had
seen
the
of
poor
karl
and
that
the
vampire
had
according
to
rule
paid
her
the
first
visit
because
he
loved
her
best
this
was
horrible
enough
if
the
vampire
were
not
really
the
person
he
represented
but
if
in
any
sense
it
were
karl
himself
at
least
it
gave
some
expectation
of
a
more
prolonged
existence
than
her
father
had
taught
her
to
look
for
and
if
love
anything
like
her
mother
still
lasted
even
along
with
the
habits
of
a
vampire
there
was
something
to
hope
for
in
the
future
and
then
though
he
had
visited
her
he
had
not
as
far
as
she
was
aware
deprived
her
of
a
drop
of
blood
she
could
not
be
certain
that
he
had
not
bitten
her
for
she
had
been
in
such
a
strange
condition
of
mind
that
she
might
not
have
felt
it
but
she
believed
that
he
had
restrained
the
impulses
of
his
vampire
nature
and
had
left
her
lest
he
should
yet
yield
to
them
she
fell
fast
asleep
and
when
morning
came
there
was
not
as
far
as
she
could
judge
one
of
those
triangular
perforations
to
be
found
upon
her
whole
body
will
it
be
believed
that
the
moment
she
was
satisfied
of
this
she
was
seized
by
a
terrible
jealousy
lest
karl
should
have
gone
and
bitten
some
one
else
most
people
will
wonder
that
she
should
not
have
gone
out
of
her
senses
at
once
but
there
was
all
the
difference
between
a
visit
from
a
real
vampire
and
a
visit
from
a
man
she
had
begun
to
love
even
although
she
took
him
for
a
vampire
all
the
difference
does
lie
in
a
name
they
were
very
different
causes
and
the
effects
must
be
very
different
when
teufelsbuerst
came
down
in
the
morning
he
crept
into
the
studio
like
a
murderer
there
lay
the
awful
white
block
seeming
to
his
eyes
just
the
same
as
he
had
left
it
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
he
dared
not
open
it
mould
and
model
must
go
together
but
whither
if
inquiry
should
be
made
after
wolkenlicht
and
this
were
discovered
anywhere
on
his
premises
would
it
not
be
enough
to
bring
him
at
once
to
the
gallows
therefore
it
would
be
dangerous
to
bury
it
in
the
garden
or
in
the
cellar
thought
he
with
a
shudder
would
be
to
fix
the
vampire
as
a
guest
for
ever
and
the
horrors
of
the
past
night
rushed
back
upon
his
imagination
with
renewed
intensity
what
would
it
be
to
have
the
dead
karl
crawling
about
his
house
for
ever
now
inside
now
out
now
sitting
on
the
stairs
now
staring
in
at
the
windows
he
would
have
dragged
it
to
the
bottom
of
his
garden
past
which
the
moldau
flowed
and
plunged
it
into
the
stream
but
then
should
the
spectre
continue
to
prove
troublesome
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
reach
the
body
so
as
to
destroy
it
by
fire
besides
which
he
could
not
do
it
without
assistance
and
the
probability
of
discovery
if
however
the
apparition
should
turn
out
to
be
no
vampire
but
only
a
respectable
ghost
they
might
manage
to
endure
its
presence
till
it
should
be
weary
of
haunting
them
he
resolved
at
last
to
convey
the
body
for
the
meantime
into
a
concealed
cellar
in
the
house
seeing
something
must
be
done
before
his
daughter
came
down
proceeding
to
remove
it
his
consternation
as
greatly
increased
when
he
discovered
how
the
body
had
grown
in
weight
since
he
had
thus
disposed
of
it
leaving
on
his
mind
scarcely
a
hope
that
it
could
turn
out
not
to
be
a
vampire
after
all
he
could
scarcely
stir
it
and
there
was
but
one
whom
he
could
call
to
his
assistance
the
old
woman
who
acted
as
his
housekeeper
and
servant
he
went
to
her
room
roused
her
and
told
her
the
whole
story
devoted
to
her
master
for
many
years
and
not
quite
so
sensitive
to
fearful
influences
as
when
less
experienced
in
horrors
she
showed
immediate
readiness
to
render
him
assistance
utterly
unable
however
to
lift
the
mass
between
them
they
could
only
drag
and
push
it
along
and
such
a
slow
toil
was
it
that
there
was
no
time
to
remove
the
traces
of
its
track
before
lilith
came
down
and
saw
a
broad
white
line
leading
from
the
door
of
the
studio
down
the
she
knew
in
a
moment
what
it
meant
but
not
a
word
was
uttered
about
the
matter
and
the
name
of
karl
wolkenlicht
seemed
to
be
entirely
forgotten
but
how
could
the
affairs
of
a
house
go
on
all
the
same
when
every
one
of
the
household
knew
that
a
dead
body
lay
in
the
cellar
nay
more
that
although
it
lay
still
and
dead
enough
all
day
it
would
come
half
alive
at
nightfall
and
turning
the
whole
house
into
a
sepulchre
by
its
presence
go
creeping
about
like
a
cat
all
over
it
in
the
dark
perhaps
with
phosphorescent
eyes
so
it
was
not
surprising
that
the
painter
abandoned
his
studio
early
and
that
the
three
found
themselves
together
in
the
gorgeous
room
formerly
described
as
soon
as
twilight
began
to
fall
already
teufelsbuerst
had
begun
to
experience
a
kind
of
shrinking
from
the
horrid
faces
in
his
own
pictures
and
to
feel
disgusted
at
the
abortions
of
his
own
mind
but
all
that
he
and
the
old
woman
now
felt
was
an
increasing
fear
as
the
night
drew
on
a
kind
of
sickening
and
paralysing
terror
the
thing
down
there
would
not
lie
quiet
at
least
its
phantom
in
the
cellars
of
their
imagination
would
not
as
much
as
possible
however
they
avoided
alarming
lilith
who
knowing
all
they
knew
was
as
silent
as
they
but
her
mind
was
in
a
strange
state
of
excitement
partly
from
the
presence
of
a
new
sense
of
love
the
pleasure
of
which
all
the
atmosphere
of
grief
into
which
it
grew
could
not
totally
quench
it
comforted
her
somehow
as
a
child
may
comfort
when
his
father
is
away
bedtime
came
and
no
one
made
a
move
to
go
without
a
word
spoken
on
the
subject
the
three
remained
together
all
night
the
elders
nodding
and
slumbering
occasionally
and
lilith
getting
some
share
of
repose
on
a
couch
all
night
the
shape
of
death
might
be
somewhere
about
the
house
but
it
did
not
disturb
them
they
heard
no
sound
saw
no
sight
and
when
the
morning
dawned
they
separated
chilled
and
stupid
and
for
the
time
beyond
fear
to
seek
repose
in
their
private
chambers
there
they
remained
equally
undisturbed
but
when
the
painter
approached
his
easel
a
few
hours
after
looking
more
pale
and
haggard
still
than
he
was
wont
from
the
fears
of
the
night
a
new
bewilderment
took
possession
of
him
he
had
been
busy
with
a
fresh
embodiment
of
his
favourite
subject
into
which
he
had
sketched
the
form
of
the
student
as
the
sufferer
he
had
represented
poor
wolkenlicht
as
just
beginning
to
recover
from
a
trance
while
a
group
of
surgeons
unaware
of
the
signs
of
returning
life
were
absorbed
in
a
minute
dissection
of
one
of
the
limbs
at
an
open
door
he
had
painted
lilith
passing
with
her
face
buried
in
a
bunch
of
sweet
peas
but
when
he
came
to
the
picture
he
found
to
his
astonishment
and
terror
that
the
face
of
one
of
the
group
was
now
turned
towards
that
of
the
victim
regarding
his
revival
with
demoniac
satisfaction
and
taking
pains
to
prevent
the
others
from
discovering
it
the
face
of
this
prince
of
torturers
was
that
of
teufelsbuerst
himself
lilith
had
altogether
vanished
and
in
her
place
stood
the
dim
vampire
reiteration
of
the
body
that
lay
extended
on
the
table
staring
greedily
at
the
assembled
company
with
trembling
hands
the
painter
removed
the
picture
from
the
easel
and
turned
its
face
to
the
wall
of
course
this
was
the
work
of
lottchen
when
he
left
the
house
he
took
with
him
the
key
of
a
small
private
door
which
was
so
seldom
used
that
while
it
remained
closed
the
key
would
not
be
missed
perhaps
for
many
months
watching
the
windows
he
had
chosen
a
safe
time
to
enter
and
had
been
hard
at
work
all
night
on
these
alterations
teufelsbuerst
attributed
them
to
the
vampire
and
left
the
picture
as
he
found
it
not
daring
to
put
brush
to
it
again
the
next
night
was
passed
much
after
the
same
fashion
but
the
fear
had
begun
to
die
away
a
little
in
the
hearts
of
the
women
who
did
not
know
what
had
taken
place
in
the
studio
on
the
previous
night
it
burrowed
however
with
gathered
force
in
the
vitals
of
teufelsbuerst
but
this
night
likewise
passed
in
peace
and
before
it
was
over
the
old
woman
had
taken
to
speculating
in
her
own
mind
as
to
the
best
way
of
disposing
of
the
body
seeing
it
was
not
at
all
likely
to
be
troublesome
but
when
the
painter
entered
his
studio
in
trepidation
the
next
morning
he
found
that
the
form
of
the
lovely
lilith
was
painted
out
of
every
picture
in
the
room
this
could
not
be
concealed
and
lilith
and
the
servant
became
aware
that
the
studio
was
the
portion
of
the
house
in
haunting
which
the
vampire
left
the
rest
in
peace
karl
recounted
all
the
tricks
he
had
played
to
his
friend
heinrich
who
begged
to
be
allowed
to
bear
him
company
the
following
night
to
this
karl
consented
thinking
it
would
be
considerably
more
agreeable
to
have
a
companion
so
they
took
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
and
some
provisions
with
them
and
before
midnight
found
themselves
snug
in
the
studio
they
sat
very
quiet
for
some
time
for
they
knew
that
if
they
were
seen
two
vampires
would
not
be
so
terrible
as
one
and
might
occasion
discovery
but
at
length
heinrich
could
bear
it
no
longer
say
lottchen
let
go
and
look
for
your
dead
body
what
has
the
old
beggar
done
with
it
think
i
know
stop
let
me
peep
out
all
right
come
along
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
he
led
the
way
to
the
cellars
and
after
searching
about
a
little
they
discovered
it
looks
horrid
enough
said
heinrich
think
a
drop
or
two
of
wine
would
brighten
it
up
a
little
so
he
took
a
bottle
from
his
pocket
and
after
they
had
had
a
glass
apiece
he
dropped
a
third
in
blots
all
over
the
plaster
being
red
wine
it
had
the
effect
hoellenrachen
desired
they
visit
it
next
they
will
know
that
the
vampire
can
find
the
food
he
prefers
said
he
in
a
corner
close
by
the
plaster
they
found
the
clothes
karl
had
worn
said
heinrich
make
something
of
this
find
so
he
carried
them
with
him
to
the
studio
there
he
got
hold
of
the
are
you
about
heinrich
to
make
a
scarecrow
to
keep
the
ravens
off
old
pictures
answered
heinrich
as
he
went
on
dressing
the
in
karl
clothes
he
next
seated
the
creature
at
an
easel
with
its
back
to
the
door
so
that
it
should
be
the
first
thing
the
painter
should
see
when
he
entered
karl
meant
to
remove
this
before
he
went
for
it
was
too
comical
to
fall
in
with
the
rest
of
his
proceedings
but
the
two
sat
down
to
their
supper
and
by
the
time
they
had
finished
the
wine
they
thought
they
should
like
to
go
to
bed
so
they
got
up
and
went
home
and
karl
forgot
the
leaving
it
in
busy
motionlessness
all
night
before
the
easel
when
teufelsbuerst
saw
it
he
turned
and
fled
with
a
cry
that
brought
his
daughter
to
his
help
he
rushed
past
her
able
only
to
articulate
the
vampire
the
vampire
painting
far
more
courageous
than
he
because
her
conscience
was
more
peaceful
lilith
passed
on
to
the
studio
she
too
recoiled
a
step
or
two
when
she
saw
the
figure
but
with
the
sight
of
the
back
of
karl
as
she
supposed
it
to
be
came
the
longing
to
see
the
face
that
was
on
the
other
side
so
she
crept
round
and
round
by
the
wall
as
far
off
as
she
could
the
figure
remained
motionless
it
was
a
strange
kind
of
shock
that
she
experienced
when
she
saw
the
face
disgusting
from
its
inanity
the
absurdity
next
struck
her
and
with
the
absurdity
flashed
into
her
mind
the
conviction
that
this
was
not
the
doing
of
a
vampire
for
of
all
creatures
under
the
moon
he
could
not
be
expected
to
be
a
humorist
a
wild
hope
sprang
up
in
her
mind
that
karl
was
not
dead
of
this
she
soon
resolved
to
make
herself
sure
she
closed
the
door
of
the
studio
in
the
strength
of
her
new
hope
undressed
the
figure
put
it
in
its
place
concealed
the
garments
all
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
and
then
finding
her
father
just
recovering
from
the
worst
of
his
fear
told
him
there
was
nothing
in
the
studio
but
what
ought
to
be
there
and
persuaded
him
to
go
and
see
he
not
only
saw
no
one
but
found
that
no
further
liberties
had
been
taken
with
his
pictures
reassured
he
soon
persuaded
himself
that
the
spectre
in
this
case
had
been
the
offspring
of
his
own
brain
but
he
had
no
spirit
for
painting
now
he
wandered
about
the
house
himself
haunting
it
like
a
restless
ghost
when
night
came
lilith
retired
to
her
own
room
the
waters
of
fear
had
begun
to
subside
in
the
house
but
the
painter
and
his
old
attendant
did
not
yet
follow
her
example
as
soon
however
as
the
house
was
quite
still
lilith
glided
noiselessly
down
the
stairs
went
into
the
studio
where
as
yet
there
assuredly
was
no
vampire
and
concealed
herself
in
a
corner
as
it
would
not
do
for
an
earnest
student
like
heinrich
to
be
away
from
his
work
very
often
he
had
not
asked
to
accompany
lottchen
this
time
and
indeed
karl
himself
a
little
anxious
about
the
result
of
the
scarecrow
greatly
preferred
going
alone
while
she
was
waiting
for
what
might
happen
the
conviction
grew
upon
lilith
as
she
reviewed
all
the
past
of
the
story
that
these
phenomena
were
the
work
of
the
real
karl
and
of
no
vampire
in
a
few
moments
she
was
still
more
sure
of
this
behind
the
screen
where
she
had
taken
refuge
hung
one
of
the
pictures
out
of
which
her
portrait
had
been
painted
the
night
before
last
she
had
taken
a
lamp
with
her
into
the
studio
with
the
intention
of
extinguishing
it
the
moment
she
heard
any
sign
of
approach
but
as
the
vampire
lingered
she
began
to
occupy
herself
with
examining
the
picture
beside
her
she
had
not
looked
at
it
long
before
she
wetted
the
tip
of
her
forefinger
and
began
to
rub
away
at
the
obliteration
her
suspicions
were
instantly
confirmed
the
substance
employed
was
only
a
gummy
wash
over
the
paint
the
delight
she
experienced
at
the
discovery
threw
her
into
a
mischievous
humour
will
see
she
said
to
herself
i
can
not
match
karl
wolkenlicht
at
this
game
in
a
closet
in
the
room
hung
a
number
of
costumes
which
lilith
had
at
different
times
worn
for
her
father
among
them
was
a
large
white
drapery
which
she
easily
disposed
as
a
shroud
with
the
help
of
some
chalk
she
soon
made
herself
ghastly
enough
and
then
placing
her
lamp
on
the
floor
behind
the
screen
and
setting
a
chair
over
it
so
that
it
should
throw
no
light
in
any
direction
she
waited
once
more
for
the
vampire
nor
had
she
much
longer
to
wait
she
soon
heard
a
door
move
the
sound
of
which
she
hardly
knew
and
then
the
studio
door
opened
her
heart
beat
dreadfully
not
with
fear
lest
it
should
be
a
vampire
after
all
but
with
hope
that
it
was
karl
to
see
him
once
more
was
too
great
joy
would
she
not
make
up
to
him
for
all
her
coldness
but
would
he
care
for
her
now
perhaps
he
had
been
quite
cured
of
his
longing
for
a
hard
heart
like
hers
she
peeped
it
was
he
sure
enough
looking
as
handsome
as
ever
he
was
holding
his
light
to
look
at
her
last
work
and
the
expression
of
his
face
even
in
regarding
her
handiwork
was
enough
to
let
her
know
that
he
loved
her
still
if
she
had
not
seen
this
she
dared
not
have
shown
herself
from
her
taking
the
lamp
in
her
hand
she
got
upon
the
chair
and
looked
over
the
screen
letting
the
light
shine
from
below
upon
her
face
she
then
made
a
slight
noise
to
attract
karl
attention
he
looked
up
evidently
rather
startled
and
saw
the
face
of
lilith
in
the
air
he
gave
a
stifled
cry
threw
himself
on
his
knees
with
his
arms
stretched
towards
her
and
moaned
have
killed
her
i
have
killed
her
lilith
descended
and
approached
him
noiselessly
he
did
not
move
she
came
close
to
him
and
said
you
karl
wolkenlicht
his
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
you
are
a
vampire
and
i
am
a
ghost
she
said
but
a
low
happy
laugh
alone
concluded
the
sentence
karl
sprang
to
his
feet
lilith
laugh
changed
into
a
burst
of
sobbing
and
weeping
and
in
another
moment
the
ghost
was
in
the
arms
of
the
vampire
lilith
had
no
idea
how
far
her
father
had
wronged
karl
and
though
from
thinking
over
the
past
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
painter
had
drugged
him
he
did
not
wish
to
pain
her
by
imparting
this
conviction
but
lilith
was
afraid
of
a
reaction
of
rage
and
hatred
in
her
father
after
the
terror
was
removed
and
karl
saw
that
he
might
thus
be
deprived
of
all
further
intercourse
with
lilith
and
all
chance
of
softening
the
old
man
heart
towards
him
while
lilith
would
not
hear
of
forsaking
him
who
had
banished
all
the
human
race
but
herself
they
managed
at
length
to
agree
upon
a
plan
of
operation
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
go
to
the
cellar
where
the
plaster
mass
lay
karl
carrying
with
him
a
great
axe
used
for
cleaving
wood
lilith
shuddered
when
she
saw
it
stained
as
it
was
with
the
wine
heinrich
had
spilt
over
it
and
almost
believed
herself
the
midnight
companion
of
a
vampire
after
all
visiting
with
him
the
terrible
corpse
in
which
he
lived
all
day
but
karl
soon
reassured
her
and
a
few
good
blows
of
the
axe
revealed
a
very
different
core
to
that
which
teufelsbuerst
supposed
to
be
in
it
karl
broke
it
into
pieces
and
with
lilith
help
who
insisted
on
carrying
her
share
the
whole
was
soon
at
the
bottom
of
the
moldau
and
every
trace
of
its
ever
having
existed
removed
before
morning
too
the
form
of
lilith
had
dawned
anew
in
every
picture
there
was
no
time
to
restore
to
its
former
condition
the
one
karl
had
first
altered
for
in
it
the
changes
were
all
that
they
seemed
nor
indeed
was
he
capable
of
restoring
it
in
the
style
but
they
put
it
quite
out
of
the
way
and
hoped
that
sufficient
time
might
elapse
before
the
painter
thought
of
it
again
when
they
had
done
and
lilith
for
all
his
entreaties
would
remain
with
him
no
longer
karl
took
his
former
clothes
with
him
and
having
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
his
old
room
dressed
in
them
in
the
morning
when
teufelsbuerst
entered
his
studio
next
day
there
sat
karl
as
if
nothing
had
happened
finishing
the
drawing
on
which
he
had
been
at
work
when
the
fit
of
insensibility
came
upon
him
the
painter
started
stared
rubbed
his
eyes
thought
it
was
another
spectral
illusion
and
was
on
the
point
of
yielding
to
his
terror
when
karl
rose
and
approached
him
with
a
smile
the
healthy
sunshiny
countenance
of
karl
let
him
be
ghost
or
goblin
could
not
fail
to
produce
somewhat
of
a
tranquilizing
effect
on
teufelsbuerst
he
took
his
offered
hand
mechanically
his
countenance
utterly
vacant
with
idiotic
bewilderment
karl
said
was
not
well
and
thought
it
better
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
friend
for
a
few
days
but
i
shall
soon
make
up
for
lost
time
for
i
am
all
right
now
he
sat
down
at
once
taking
no
notice
of
his
master
behaviour
and
went
on
with
his
drawing
teufelsbuerst
stood
staring
at
him
for
some
minutes
without
moving
then
suddenly
turned
and
left
the
room
karl
heard
him
hurrying
down
the
cellar
stairs
in
a
few
moments
he
came
up
again
karl
stole
a
glance
at
him
there
he
stood
in
the
same
spot
no
doubt
more
full
of
bewilderment
than
ever
but
it
was
not
possible
that
his
face
should
express
more
at
last
he
went
to
his
easel
and
sat
down
with
a
sigh
as
if
of
relief
but
though
he
sat
at
his
easel
he
painted
none
that
day
and
as
often
as
karl
ventured
a
glance
he
saw
him
still
staring
at
him
the
discovery
that
his
pictures
were
restored
to
their
former
condition
aided
no
doubt
in
leading
him
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
other
facts
whatever
that
conclusion
might
be
probably
that
he
had
been
the
sport
of
some
evil
power
and
had
been
for
the
greater
part
of
a
week
utterly
bewitched
lilith
had
taken
care
to
instruct
the
old
woman
with
whom
she
was
and
as
neither
of
them
showed
the
smallest
traces
of
the
astonishment
which
seemed
to
be
slowly
vitrifying
his
own
brain
he
was
at
last
perfectly
satisfied
that
things
had
been
going
on
all
right
everywhere
but
in
his
inner
man
and
in
this
conclusion
he
certainly
was
not
far
wrong
in
more
senses
than
one
but
when
all
was
restored
again
to
the
old
routine
it
became
evident
that
the
peculiar
direction
of
his
art
in
which
he
had
hitherto
indulged
had
ceased
to
interest
him
the
shock
had
acted
chiefly
upon
that
part
of
his
mental
being
which
had
been
so
absorbed
he
would
sit
for
hours
without
doing
anything
apparently
plunged
in
several
weeks
elapsed
without
any
change
and
both
lilith
and
karl
were
getting
dreadfully
anxious
about
him
karl
paid
him
every
attention
and
the
old
man
for
he
now
looked
much
older
than
before
submitted
to
receive
his
services
as
well
as
those
of
lilith
at
length
one
morning
he
said
in
a
slow
thoughtful
tone
wolkenlicht
i
should
like
to
paint
you
sir
answered
karl
jumping
up
would
you
like
me
to
sit
so
the
ice
of
silence
and
inactivity
was
broken
and
the
painter
drew
and
painted
and
the
spring
of
his
art
flowed
once
more
and
he
made
a
beautiful
portrait
of
karl
a
portrait
without
evil
or
suffering
and
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
karl
he
began
once
more
to
paint
lilith
and
when
he
had
painted
her
he
composed
a
picture
for
the
very
purpose
of
introducing
them
together
and
in
this
picture
there
was
neither
ugliness
nor
torture
but
human
feeling
and
human
hope
instead
then
karl
knew
that
he
might
speak
to
him
of
lilith
and
he
spoke
and
was
heard
with
a
smile
but
he
did
not
dare
to
tell
him
the
truth
of
the
vampire
story
till
one
day
that
teufelsbuerst
was
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
room
in
karl
ancestral
castle
half
smothered
in
grandchildren
when
the
only
answer
it
drew
from
the
old
man
was
a
kind
of
shuddering
laugh
and
the
words
speak
of
it
karl
my
boy
no
one
had
interrupted
harry
his
brother
had
put
a
shovelful
of
coals
on
the
fire
to
keep
up
the
flame
but
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
the
cold
moon
had
shone
in
at
the
windows
all
the
time
her
light
made
yet
colder
by
the
snowy
sheen
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
any
horror
that
the
story
could
generate
had
had
full
freedom
to
operate
on
the
minds
of
the
listeners
well
i
glad
its
over
for
my
part
said
bloomfield
it
made
my
flesh
creep
i
do
not
see
any
good
in
founding
a
story
upon
a
superstition
one
knows
it
is
false
all
the
time
said
cathcart
but
said
harry
all
that
i
have
related
might
have
taken
place
for
the
story
is
not
founded
on
the
superstition
itself
but
on
the
belief
of
the
people
of
the
time
in
the
superstition
i
have
merely
used
this
belief
to
give
the
general
tone
to
the
story
and
sometimes
the
particular
occasion
for
events
in
it
the
vampire
being
a
terrible
fact
to
those
times
you
write
said
the
curate
as
if
you
quoted
occasionally
from
some
authority
the
story
of
john
kuntz
as
well
as
that
of
the
shoemaker
is
told
by
henry
more
in
his
against
he
believed
the
whole
affair
his
authority
is
martin
weinrich
a
silesian
doctor
i
have
only
taken
the
liberty
of
shifting
the
scene
of
the
exploits
of
kuntz
from
a
town
of
silesia
to
prague
well
harry
said
his
if
your
object
was
to
frighten
us
i
confess
that
i
for
one
was
tolerably
uncomfortable
but
i
know
that
that
is
a
very
high
aim
in
if
that
were
all
certainly
not
replied
harry
glancing
towards
adela
who
had
not
spoken
nor
did
she
speak
yet
but
her
expression
showed
plainly
enough
that
it
was
not
the
horror
of
the
story
that
had
taken
chief
hold
of
her
mind
her
face
was
full
of
suppressed
light
and
she
was
evidently
satisfied
or
shall
i
call
it
as
well
as
delighted
with
the
tale
something
or
other
in
it
had
touched
her
not
only
deeply
but
nearly
nothing
was
said
about
another
meeting
perhaps
because
from
illness
the
order
had
been
interrupted
and
the
present
had
required
a
special
summons
the
ladies
had
gone
up
stairs
to
put
on
their
bonnets
i
had
crossed
into
the
library
which
was
on
the
same
floor
with
the
to
find
out
if
i
was
right
in
supposing
i
had
seen
some
volumes
of
henry
more
works
on
the
shelves
certainly
the
colonel
could
never
have
bought
them
our
host
the
curate
and
the
schoolmaster
had
followed
me
harry
had
remained
behind
in
the
thinking
of
something
i
wanted
to
say
to
him
before
he
went
i
left
the
gentlemen
looking
over
the
and
went
to
cross
again
to
the
but
when
i
reached
the
door
there
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stair
adela
and
harry
she
had
evidently
just
said
something
warm
about
the
story
i
could
almost
read
what
she
had
said
still
lingering
on
her
face
which
was
turned
up
a
good
deal
to
look
into
his
so
near
each
other
were
they
standing
hers
had
a
rosy
flush
as
of
sunset
over
it
while
his
glowed
like
the
sun
rising
in
a
mist
evidently
the
pleasures
of
giving
and
receiving
were
in
this
case
nearly
equal
but
they
were
not
of
long
duration
for
the
moment
i
appeared
they
bade
each
other
a
hurried
good
night
and
parted
i
thinking
it
better
to
pretermit
my
speech
to
harry
retreated
into
the
library
and
was
glad
to
think
that
no
one
had
seen
that
conference
but
myself
such
a
conjunction
of
planets
prefigured
however
not
merely
warm
spring
weather
but
sultry
gloom
and
thunderous
clouds
to
follow
and
although
i
was
delighted
with
my
astronomical
observation
i
could
not
help
growing
anxious
about
the
omen
chapter
vii
the
castle
the
next
day
as
i
passed
the
on
my
way
to
call
on
the
curate
i
heard
such
an
uproar
that
i
stopped
involuntarily
to
listen
i
soon
satisfied
myself
that
it
was
only
the
usual
occasioned
on
the
ocean
of
boyhood
by
the
vacuum
of
the
master
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
curate
study
there
stood
the
missing
master
hat
in
hand
he
had
not
sat
down
and
would
not
hearing
all
the
time
no
doubt
in
his
soul
the
far
confusion
of
his
forsaken
realm
he
had
but
that
moment
entered
you
come
just
in
the
right
time
smith
said
the
we
had
already
dropped
unnecessary
here
is
bloomfield
come
to
ask
us
to
spend
a
final
evening
with
him
and
bloomfield
and
in
the
name
of
the
whole
company
i
have
taken
upon
me
to
assure
him
that
it
will
give
us
pleasure
am
i
not
right
undoubtedly
i
replied
what
evening
have
you
fixed
upon
mr
bloomfield
this
day
week
he
answered
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
put
it
off
so
long
if
you
please
i
heard
your
brother
armstrong
say
that
you
were
very
fond
of
parables
now
i
have
always
had
a
leaning
that
way
myself
and
for
years
i
have
had
one
in
particular
glimmering
before
my
mental
sight
the
ambition
seized
me
to
write
it
out
for
one
of
our
meetings
and
so
submit
it
to
your
judgment
for
armstrong
i
am
so
delighted
with
your
sermons
and
opinions
generally
that
i
long
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
not
only
friendly
but
capable
of
sympathizing
with
you
but
it
is
only
in
the
rough
yet
and
i
want
to
have
plenty
of
time
to
act
the
dutiful
bear
to
my
offspring
and
lick
it
into
thorough
shape
so
if
you
will
come
this
day
week
bloomfield
and
i
will
be
delighted
to
entertain
you
in
our
humble
fashion
but
bless
me
the
boys
will
be
all
in
a
heap
of
confusion
worse
confounded
before
i
get
back
to
them
i
have
no
business
to
be
away
from
them
at
this
hour
good
morning
gentlemen
and
off
ran
the
worthy
neptune
to
quell
by
the
vision
of
his
returning
head
the
rebellious
waves
of
boyish
impulse
that
man
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
you
armstrong
i
said
i
know
he
will
he
is
a
and
what
is
better
a
man
there
is
true
wealth
in
him
it
seems
to
me
although
it
may
be
of
narrow
reach
in
expression
said
i
i
think
so
quite
he
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
those
who
have
never
grown
robust
because
they
have
laboured
instead
of
going
out
to
work
in
the
open
air
there
is
a
shrinking
delicacy
about
him
when
with
those
whom
he
does
feel
to
be
of
his
own
kind
which
makes
him
show
to
a
disadvantage
but
you
should
see
him
amongst
his
boys
to
do
him
justice
we
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
armstrong
who
came
after
their
simple
fashion
to
tell
her
husband
that
dinner
was
ready
i
took
my
leave
in
the
evening
bloomfield
called
to
invite
adela
and
the
colonel
and
the
affair
was
settled
for
that
day
week
you
much
better
my
dear
are
you
not
said
the
worthy
woman
to
my
niece
indeed
i
am
bloomfield
i
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
i
should
be
so
much
better
in
so
short
a
time
and
at
this
season
of
the
year
too
armstrong
is
a
very
clever
young
man
i
think
though
i
ca
say
i
quite
relished
that
extraordinary
story
of
his
i
suppose
he
is
clever
replied
adela
something
demurely
as
i
thought
i
must
say
i
liked
the
story
ah
well
young
people
you
know
smith
but
bless
me
i
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
i
had
forgotten
you
were
a
married
man
of
course
you
one
of
the
young
people
too
mr
smith
i
do
think
there
much
of
youth
to
choose
between
you
and
me
bloomfield
said
i
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
but
i
fear
i
do
belong
to
the
young
people
if
a
liking
for
extravagant
stories
so
long
as
they
mean
well
you
know
is
to
be
the
test
of
the
classification
i
fear
i
have
a
depraved
taste
that
way
i
do
mean
in
this
particular
instance
though
adela
i
hope
not
answered
adela
with
a
blushing
smile
which
i
at
least
could
read
having
had
not
merely
the
key
to
it
but
the
open
door
and
window
as
well
ever
since
i
had
seen
the
two
standing
together
at
the
top
of
the
stair
that
night
the
weather
broke
a
slow
thaw
set
in
and
before
many
days
were
over
islands
of
green
began
to
appear
amid
the
wan
water
of
the
snow
to
use
a
phrase
common
in
scotch
ballads
though
with
a
different
application
the
graves
in
the
churchyard
lifted
up
their
green
altars
of
earth
as
the
first
whereon
to
return
thanks
for
the
prophecy
of
spring
which
surely
if
it
has
force
and
truth
anywhere
speaks
loudest
to
us
in
the
churchyard
and
on
sunday
the
sun
broke
out
and
shone
on
the
green
hillocks
just
as
good
old
venables
was
reading
the
words
i
will
not
leave
you
comfortless
i
will
come
to
you
and
the
ice
vanished
from
the
river
and
the
dark
stream
flowed
somewhat
sullen
but
yet
glad
at
heart
on
through
the
low
meadows
bordered
with
pollards
which
poor
things
maltreated
and
mutilated
yet
did
the
best
they
could
and
went
on
growing
wildly
in
all
insane
shapes
pitifully
mingling
formality
and
grotesqueness
and
the
next
day
the
hounds
met
at
castle
irksham
and
that
day
colonel
cathcart
would
ride
with
them
for
the
good
man
had
gathered
spirit
just
as
the
light
grew
upon
his
daughter
face
and
he
was
merry
like
a
boy
now
that
the
first
breath
of
spring
for
so
it
seemed
although
no
doubt
plenty
of
wintriness
remained
and
would
yet
show
itself
had
loosened
the
hard
hold
of
the
frost
which
is
the
death
of
nature
the
frost
is
hard
upon
old
people
and
the
spring
is
so
much
the
more
genial
and
blessed
in
its
sweet
influences
on
them
do
we
grow
old
that
in
our
weakness
and
loss
of
physical
we
may
learn
the
benignities
of
the
universe
only
to
be
learned
first
through
the
feeling
of
their
want
i
do
not
envy
the
man
who
laughs
the
east
wind
to
scorn
he
can
never
know
the
balmy
power
of
its
sister
of
the
west
which
is
the
breath
of
the
lord
the
symbol
of
the
one
strength
at
the
root
of
all
life
resurrection
and
growth
commonly
called
the
spirit
of
who
has
not
seen
as
the
infirmities
of
age
grow
upon
old
men
the
haughty
spirit
that
had
neglected
if
not
despised
the
gentle
ministrations
of
love
grow
as
it
were
a
little
scared
and
begin
to
look
about
for
some
kindness
begin
to
return
the
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
and
to
submit
to
be
waited
upon
by
the
anxiety
of
love
not
in
weakness
alone
comes
the
second
childhood
upon
men
but
often
in
childlikeness
for
in
old
age
as
in
nature
to
quote
the
song
of
the
curate
old
autumn
fingers
paint
in
hues
of
spring
the
necessities
of
the
old
man
prefigure
and
forerun
the
dawn
of
the
immortal
childhood
for
is
not
our
necessity
towards
god
our
highest
blessedness
the
fair
cloud
that
hangs
over
the
summit
of
existence
thank
god
he
has
made
his
children
so
noble
and
high
that
they
can
not
do
without
him
i
believe
we
are
sent
into
this
world
just
to
find
this
out
but
to
leave
my
reflections
and
return
to
my
story
such
as
it
is
the
colonel
mounted
me
on
an
old
horse
of
his
whom
to
quote
from
sir
philip
sidney
though
he
was
near
twenty
years
old
he
preferred
for
a
piece
of
sure
service
before
a
great
number
of
younger
now
the
piece
of
sure
service
in
the
present
instance
was
to
take
care
of
old
john
smith
who
was
only
a
middling
horseman
though
his
friend
the
colonel
would
say
that
he
rode
pretty
well
for
a
lad
the
old
horse
in
fact
knew
not
only
what
he
could
do
but
what
i
could
do
for
our
powers
were
about
equal
he
looked
well
about
for
the
gaps
and
the
narrow
places
from
weakness
in
his
forelegs
he
had
become
a
capital
as
i
think
cathcart
called
him
always
alighting
over
a
hedge
on
his
hind
legs
instead
of
his
fore
ones
which
was
as
much
easier
for
john
smith
as
for
hop
o
my
thumb
that
was
the
name
of
the
old
horse
he
being
sixteen
hands
at
least
but
i
beg
my
reader
pardon
for
troubling
him
with
all
this
about
my
horse
for
assuredly
neither
he
nor
i
will
perform
any
deed
of
prowess
in
his
presence
but
i
have
the
weakness
of
garrulity
in
regard
to
a
predilection
from
the
indulgence
of
which
circumstances
have
debarred
me
at
nine
my
friend
and
i
started
upon
hacks
for
the
meet
now
i
am
not
going
to
describe
the
harrow
and
weal
away
with
which
the
soul
of
poor
reynard
is
hunted
out
of
the
world
if
indeed
such
a
clever
wretch
can
have
a
soul
i
daresay
i
hope
at
least
that
the
argument
of
the
is
analogically
just
who
being
expostulated
with
on
the
cruelty
of
replied
well
you
know
the
hounds
like
it
and
the
horses
like
it
and
there
no
doubt
the
men
like
it
and
who
knows
whether
the
fox
does
like
it
too
but
i
would
not
have
introduced
the
subject
except
for
the
sake
of
what
my
reader
will
find
in
the
course
of
a
page
or
two
and
which
assuredly
is
not
we
soon
found
but
just
before
a
sudden
heavy
noise
coming
apparently
from
a
considerable
distance
made
one
or
two
of
the
company
say
with
passing
curiosity
what
is
that
it
was
instantly
forgotten
however
as
soon
as
the
fox
broke
cover
he
pointed
towards
we
had
followed
for
some
distance
circumstances
permitting
hop
o
my
thumb
to
keep
in
the
wake
of
his
master
when
the
colonel
drawing
rein
allowed
me
i
ought
to
say
for
the
old
horse
had
quite
as
much
voice
in
the
matter
as
i
had
to
come
up
with
him
the
cunning
old
dog
said
he
he
has
run
straight
for
the
deepest
cutting
in
the
railway
they
all
be
pounded
presently
they
know
this
part
so
well
as
i
do
i
know
every
field
and
gate
in
it
i
used
to
go
larking
over
it
all
when
i
was
only
a
cub
myself
confound
it
i
not
up
to
much
i
suppose
i
getting
old
you
know
or
i
strike
off
here
at
right
angles
to
the
left
and
make
for
the
bridge
at
crumple
corner
i
should
lose
the
hounds
though
i
fear
i
wonder
what
his
lordship
will
do
all
the
time
my
old
friend
was
talking
we
were
following
the
rest
of
the
field
whom
sure
enough
as
soon
as
we
got
into
the
next
inclosure
we
saw
drawing
up
one
after
another
on
the
top
of
the
railway
cutting
which
ran
like
the
river
of
death
between
them
and
the
paradise
but
at
the
moment
we
entered
this
field
whom
should
we
see
approaching
us
at
right
angles
from
the
direction
of
purleybridge
but
harry
armstrong
mounted
on
mare
i
rode
towards
him
trapped
you
see
said
i
are
you
after
the
fox
or
some
nobler
game
i
was
going
my
rounds
answered
harry
when
i
caught
sight
of
the
hounds
i
have
no
very
pressing
case
to
day
so
i
turned
a
few
yards
out
of
the
road
to
see
a
bit
of
the
sport
confound
these
railways
at
the
moment
and
all
this
passed
as
the
is
so
often
compelled
to
remind
his
reader
in
far
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
over
the
hedge
on
the
opposite
side
from
where
harry
had
entered
the
field
blundered
a
country
fellow
on
a
great
heavy
but
spirited
horse
and
ploughed
his
way
up
the
soft
furrow
to
where
we
stood
doctor
he
cried
with
haste
and
exertion
doctor
well
answered
henry
alert
there
a
awful
accident
at
grubblebon
quarry
sir
powder
blowed
up
legs
and
arms
good
god
sir
make
haste
well
said
harry
whose
compressed
lips
alone
gave
sign
of
his
being
ready
for
action
ride
to
the
town
and
tell
my
housekeeper
to
give
you
bandages
and
wadding
and
oil
and
splints
and
whatever
she
knows
to
be
needful
are
there
many
hurt
half
a
dozen
alive
sir
then
you
better
let
the
other
doctors
know
as
well
and
just
tell
my
man
to
saddle
jilter
and
take
him
to
by
brother
the
curate
he
had
better
come
out
at
once
ride
now
i
sir
said
the
man
and
was
over
the
hedge
in
another
minute
but
not
before
harry
was
over
the
railway
for
he
rode
gently
towards
it
as
if
nothing
particular
was
to
be
done
and
chose
as
the
best
spot
one
close
to
where
several
of
the
gentlemen
stood
disputing
for
a
moment
as
to
which
was
the
best
way
to
get
across
now
on
the
top
of
the
cutting
there
was
a
rail
and
between
the
rail
and
the
edge
of
the
cutting
a
space
of
about
four
feet
harry
trotted
his
mare
gently
up
to
the
rail
and
went
over
nor
was
the
mutual
confidence
of
mare
and
master
misplaced
from
either
side
she
lighted
and
stood
stock
still
within
a
foot
of
the
slope
so
powerful
was
she
to
stop
herself
an
uproar
of
cries
arose
among
the
men
i
heard
the
old
soldier
voice
above
them
all
damn
you
armstrong
you
fool
he
cried
you
break
your
neck
and
serve
you
right
too
i
do
know
a
stronger
proof
that
the
classical
hell
has
little
hold
on
the
faith
of
the
saxons
than
that
and
true
men
will
not
unfrequently
damn
their
friends
when
they
are
most
anxious
to
save
them
but
before
the
words
were
half
out
of
the
colonel
mouth
harry
was
down
the
cutting
he
had
gone
straight
at
it
like
a
cat
and
it
was
of
course
the
only
way
i
had
galloped
to
the
edge
after
him
and
now
saw
him
or
rather
her
descending
by
a
succession
of
rebounds
not
bounds
a
succession
in
fact
of
short
falls
upon
the
while
harry
head
was
nearly
touching
her
rump
arrived
at
the
bottom
she
gave
two
bounds
across
the
rails
and
the
same
moment
was
straining
right
up
the
opposite
bank
in
a
fierce
agony
of
effort
harry
hanging
upon
her
neck
now
the
mighty
play
of
her
magnificent
hind
quarters
came
into
operation
i
could
see
plainly
enough
across
the
gulf
the
alternate
knotting
and
loosening
of
the
thick
muscles
as
step
by
step
she
tore
her
way
up
the
grassy
slope
it
was
a
terrible
trial
of
muscle
and
wind
and
very
few
horses
could
have
stood
it
as
she
neared
the
top
her
pace
grew
slower
and
slower
and
the
exertion
more
and
more
severe
if
she
had
given
in
she
would
have
rolled
to
the
bottom
but
nothing
was
less
in
her
thoughts
her
master
never
spurred
or
urged
her
except
it
may
have
been
by
whispering
in
her
ear
to
which
his
mouth
was
near
enough
he
knew
she
needed
no
excitement
to
that
effort
at
length
the
final
heave
of
her
rump
as
it
came
up
to
a
level
with
her
withers
told
the
breathless
spectators
that
the
attempt
was
a
success
when
a
loud
hurrah
for
the
doctor
and
his
mare
burst
from
their
lips
the
doctor
however
only
waved
his
hand
in
acknowledgment
for
he
had
all
to
do
yet
fortunately
there
was
space
enough
between
the
edge
and
the
fence
on
that
side
to
allow
of
his
giving
his
mare
a
quarter
of
a
circle
of
a
gallop
before
bringing
her
up
to
the
rail
else
in
her
fatigue
she
might
have
failed
to
top
it
over
she
went
and
away
with
her
tail
streaming
out
behind
her
as
if
she
had
done
nothing
worth
thinking
about
once
it
was
done
one
more
cheer
for
the
doctor
but
no
one
dared
to
follow
him
they
scattered
in
different
directions
to
find
a
less
perilous
crossing
i
stuck
by
my
leader
by
jove
cathcart
said
lord
irksham
as
they
parted
that
doctor
of
yours
is
a
hero
he
ought
to
have
been
bred
a
soldier
he
better
employed
my
lord
bawled
the
old
colonel
for
they
were
now
a
good
many
yards
asunder
making
for
different
points
in
the
hedge
from
this
answer
i
hoped
well
for
the
doctor
at
all
events
the
colonel
admired
his
manliness
more
than
ever
and
that
was
a
great
thing
for
me
i
could
hardly
keep
down
the
expression
of
an
excitement
which
i
did
not
wish
to
show
it
was
a
great
relief
to
me
when
the
arose
and
i
could
let
myself
off
in
that
way
i
told
you
kind
reader
i
was
only
an
old
boy
but
as
the
arabs
always
give
god
thanks
when
they
see
a
beautiful
woman
and
quite
right
too
so
in
my
heart
i
praised
god
who
had
made
a
mare
with
such
muscles
and
a
man
with
such
a
heart
and
i
said
to
myself
a
fine
muscle
is
a
fine
thing
but
the
finest
muscle
of
all
keeping
the
others
going
too
is
the
heart
itself
that
is
the
true
christian
muscle
and
the
real
muscular
christianity
is
that
which
pours
in
a
torrent
from
the
devotion
of
the
heart
receiving
only
that
it
may
give
but
i
fancy
i
hear
my
reader
saying
smith
you
forgotten
the
fox
what
a
sportsman
you
make
well
i
had
forgotten
the
fox
but
then
we
did
kill
him
or
find
another
that
day
so
you
wo
care
for
the
rest
of
the
run
i
was
tired
enough
by
the
time
we
got
back
to
purleybridge
i
went
early
to
bed
the
next
morning
the
colonel
the
moment
we
met
at
the
breakfast
table
said
to
me
you
did
not
hear
smith
what
that
young
rascal
of
a
doctor
said
to
lord
irksham
last
night
no
what
was
it
it
seems
they
met
again
towards
evening
and
his
lordship
said
to
him
young
devil
you
know
his
lordship
rough
way
interposed
the
colonel
forgetting
how
roundly
he
had
sworn
at
harry
himself
the
time
you
my
age
you
be
more
careful
of
the
few
brains
you
have
left
to
which
expostulated
master
harry
replied
your
lordship
had
been
my
age
and
would
have
done
it
yourself
to
kill
a
fox
when
i
am
your
lordship
age
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
grace
left
to
do
as
much
to
save
a
man
whereupon
his
lordship
rejoined
holding
out
his
hand
jove
sir
you
are
an
honour
to
your
profession
come
and
dine
with
me
on
monday
and
what
do
you
think
the
idiot
did
backed
out
of
it
and
would
go
because
he
thought
his
lordship
condescending
and
he
did
want
his
patronage
but
his
lordship
not
a
bit
like
that
you
know
then
if
he
is
he
like
harry
all
the
better
for
declining
and
will
probably
send
him
a
proper
invitation
and
sure
enough
i
was
right
and
harry
did
dine
at
castle
irksham
on
monday
adela
eyes
showed
clearly
enough
that
her
ears
were
devouring
every
word
we
had
said
and
the
glow
on
her
face
could
not
be
mistaken
by
me
at
least
though
to
another
it
might
well
appear
only
the
sign
of
such
an
enthusiasm
as
one
would
like
every
girl
to
feel
in
the
presence
of
noble
conduct
of
any
kind
she
had
heard
the
whole
story
last
night
you
may
be
sure
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
unrestrained
admiration
shown
by
her
father
for
the
doctor
conduct
was
a
light
in
her
heart
which
sleep
itself
could
not
extinguish
and
which
went
shining
on
in
her
dreams
admiration
of
the
beloved
is
dear
to
a
woman
you
see
i
like
to
show
that
although
i
an
old
bachelor
i
know
something
about
i
met
harry
that
morning
that
is
i
contrived
to
meet
him
well
how
are
you
harry
i
said
all
right
thank
you
were
there
many
hurt
at
the
quarry
oh
it
was
so
very
bad
i
happy
to
say
you
did
splendidly
yesterday
oh
nonsense
it
was
my
mare
it
was
me
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
well
well
you
have
my
full
permission
to
say
so
and
to
think
so
too
well
well
say
no
more
about
it
so
it
was
long
before
the
subject
was
again
alluded
to
by
me
but
it
will
be
long
too
before
it
is
forgotten
in
that
county
and
so
the
evening
came
when
we
were
to
meet
for
the
last
time
as
the
club
at
the
schoolmaster
house
it
was
now
past
the
time
i
had
set
myself
for
returning
to
london
and
although
my
plans
were
never
of
a
very
unalterable
complexion
seeing
i
had
the
faculty
of
being
able
to
write
wherever
i
was
and
never
admitted
chairs
and
tables
and
certain
rows
of
bookshelves
to
form
part
of
my
mental
organism
without
which
the
rest
of
the
mechanism
would
be
thrown
out
of
gear
i
had
yet
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
in
london
and
i
intended
to
take
my
departure
on
the
day
but
one
after
the
final
i
may
just
remark
that
before
this
time
one
or
two
families
had
returned
to
purleybridge
and
others
were
free
from
their
christmas
engagements
who
would
have
been
much
pleased
to
join
our
club
but
considering
its
ephemeral
nature
and
seeing
it
had
been
formed
only
for
what
we
hoped
was
a
passing
necessity
we
felt
that
the
introduction
of
new
blood
although
essential
for
the
long
life
of
anything
constituted
for
long
life
would
only
hasten
the
decay
of
its
butterfly
constitution
so
we
had
kept
our
meetings
entirely
to
ourselves
we
all
arrived
about
the
same
time
and
found
our
host
and
hostess
full
of
quiet
cordiality
to
which
their
homeliness
lent
an
additional
charm
the
relation
of
host
and
guest
is
weakened
by
every
addition
to
a
company
and
in
a
large
assembly
all
but
disappears
indeed
the
tendency
of
the
present
age
is
to
blot
from
the
story
of
life
all
reminders
of
the
ordinary
human
relations
as
commonplace
and
insignificant
and
to
mingle
all
society
in
one
concourse
of
atoms
in
which
the
only
distinctions
shall
be
those
of
whereas
the
sole
power
to
keep
social
intercourse
from
growing
stale
is
the
recognition
of
the
immortal
and
true
in
all
the
simple
human
relations
then
we
look
upon
all
men
with
reverence
and
find
ourselves
safe
and
at
home
in
the
midst
of
divine
intents
which
may
be
violated
and
striven
with
but
can
never
be
escaped
because
the
will
of
god
is
the
very
life
and
of
his
creatures
bloomfield
looked
very
nice
in
her
black
silk
dress
and
collar
and
cuffs
of
old
lace
as
she
presided
at
the
and
made
us
all
feel
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
serve
us
after
repeated
apologies
and
confessions
of
failure
our
host
then
read
the
following
as
he
called
it
though
i
daresay
it
would
be
more
correct
to
call
it
an
but
as
that
word
has
so
many
wearisome
associations
i
too
intend
whether
right
or
wrong
to
call
it
a
parable
so
then
it
shall
be
the
castle
a
parable
on
the
top
of
a
high
cliff
forming
part
of
the
base
of
a
great
mountain
stood
a
lofty
castle
when
or
how
it
was
built
no
man
knew
nor
could
any
one
pretend
to
understand
its
architecture
every
one
who
looked
upon
it
felt
that
it
was
lordly
and
noble
and
where
one
part
seemed
not
to
agree
with
another
the
wise
and
modest
dared
not
to
call
them
incongruous
but
presumed
that
the
whole
might
be
constructed
on
some
higher
principle
of
architecture
than
they
yet
understood
what
helped
them
to
this
conclusion
was
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
whole
of
the
edifice
that
even
of
the
portion
best
known
some
part
or
other
was
always
wrapped
in
thick
folds
of
mist
from
the
mountain
and
that
when
the
sun
shone
upon
this
mist
the
parts
of
the
building
that
appeared
through
the
vaporous
veil
were
strangely
glorified
in
their
indistinctness
so
that
they
seemed
to
belong
to
some
aerial
abode
in
the
land
of
the
sunset
and
the
beholders
could
hardly
tell
whether
they
had
ever
seen
them
before
or
whether
they
were
now
for
the
first
time
partially
revealed
nor
although
it
was
inhabited
could
certain
information
be
procured
as
to
its
internal
construction
those
who
dwelt
in
it
often
discovered
rooms
they
had
never
entered
before
yea
once
or
twice
whole
suites
of
apartments
of
which
only
dim
legends
had
been
handed
down
from
former
times
some
of
them
expected
to
find
one
day
secret
places
filled
with
treasures
of
wondrous
jewels
amongst
which
they
hoped
to
light
upon
solomon
ring
which
had
for
ages
disappeared
from
the
earth
but
which
had
controlled
the
spirits
and
the
possession
of
which
made
a
man
simply
what
a
man
should
be
the
king
of
the
world
now
and
then
a
narrow
winding
stair
hitherto
untrodden
would
bring
them
forth
on
a
new
turret
whence
new
prospects
of
the
circumjacent
country
were
spread
out
before
them
how
many
more
of
these
there
might
be
or
how
much
loftier
no
one
could
tell
nor
could
the
foundations
of
the
castle
in
the
rock
on
which
it
was
built
be
determined
with
the
smallest
approach
to
precision
those
of
the
family
who
had
given
themselves
to
exploring
in
that
direction
found
such
a
labyrinth
of
vaults
and
passages
and
endless
successions
of
stairs
out
of
one
underground
space
into
a
yet
lower
that
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
at
least
the
whole
mountain
was
perforated
and
honeycombed
in
this
fashion
they
had
a
dim
consciousness
too
of
the
presence
in
those
awful
regions
of
beings
whom
they
could
not
comprehend
once
they
came
upon
the
brink
of
a
great
black
gulf
in
which
the
eye
could
see
nothing
but
darkness
they
recoiled
with
horror
for
the
conviction
flashed
upon
them
that
that
gulf
went
down
into
the
very
central
spaces
of
the
earth
of
which
they
had
hitherto
been
wandering
only
in
the
upper
crust
nay
that
the
seething
blackness
before
them
had
relations
mysterious
and
beyond
human
comprehension
with
the
voids
of
space
into
which
the
stars
dare
not
enter
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
whereon
the
castle
stood
lay
a
deep
lake
inaccessible
save
by
a
few
avenues
being
surrounded
on
all
sides
with
precipices
which
made
the
water
look
very
black
although
it
was
pure
as
the
from
a
door
in
the
castle
which
was
not
to
be
otherwise
entered
a
broad
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
rock
went
down
to
the
lake
and
disappeared
below
its
surface
some
thought
the
steps
went
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
water
now
in
this
castle
there
dwelt
a
large
family
of
brothers
and
sisters
they
had
never
seen
their
father
or
mother
the
younger
had
been
educated
by
the
elder
and
these
by
an
unseen
care
and
ministration
about
the
sources
of
which
they
had
somehow
or
other
troubled
themselves
very
little
for
what
people
are
accustomed
to
they
regard
as
coming
from
nobody
as
if
help
and
progress
and
joy
and
love
were
the
natural
crops
of
chaos
or
old
night
but
tradition
said
that
one
day
it
was
utterly
uncertain
their
father
would
come
and
leave
them
no
more
for
he
was
still
alive
though
where
he
lived
nobody
knew
in
the
meantime
all
the
rest
had
to
obey
their
eldest
brother
and
listen
to
his
counsels
but
almost
all
the
family
was
very
fond
of
liberty
as
they
called
it
and
liked
to
run
up
and
down
hither
and
thither
roving
about
with
neither
law
nor
order
just
as
they
pleased
so
they
could
not
endure
their
brother
tyranny
as
they
called
it
at
one
time
they
said
that
he
was
only
one
of
themselves
and
therefore
they
would
not
obey
him
at
another
that
he
was
not
like
them
and
could
not
understand
them
and
they
would
not
obey
him
yet
sometimes
when
he
came
and
looked
them
full
in
the
face
they
were
terrified
and
dared
not
disobey
for
he
was
stately
and
stern
and
strong
not
one
of
them
loved
him
heartily
except
the
eldest
sister
who
was
very
beautiful
and
silent
and
whose
eyes
shone
as
if
light
lay
somewhere
deep
behind
them
even
she
although
she
loved
him
thought
him
very
hard
sometimes
for
when
he
had
once
said
a
thing
plainly
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
think
it
over
again
so
even
she
forgot
him
sometimes
and
went
her
own
ways
and
enjoyed
herself
without
him
most
of
them
regarded
him
as
a
sort
of
watchman
whose
business
it
was
to
keep
them
in
order
and
so
they
were
indignant
and
disliked
him
yet
they
all
had
a
secret
feeling
that
they
ought
to
be
subject
to
him
and
after
any
particular
act
of
disregard
none
of
them
could
think
with
any
peace
of
the
old
story
about
the
return
of
their
father
to
his
house
but
indeed
they
never
thought
much
about
it
or
about
their
father
at
all
for
how
could
those
who
cared
so
little
for
their
brother
whom
they
saw
every
day
care
for
their
father
whom
they
had
never
seen
one
chief
cause
of
complaint
against
him
was
that
he
interfered
with
their
favourite
studies
and
pursuits
whereas
he
only
sought
to
make
them
give
up
trifling
with
earnest
things
and
seek
for
truth
and
not
for
amusement
from
the
many
wonders
around
them
he
did
not
want
them
to
turn
to
other
studies
or
to
eschew
pleasures
but
in
those
studies
to
seek
the
highest
things
most
and
other
things
in
proportion
to
their
true
worth
and
nobleness
this
could
not
fail
to
be
distasteful
to
those
who
did
not
care
for
what
was
higher
than
they
and
so
matters
went
on
for
a
time
they
thought
they
could
do
better
without
their
brother
and
their
brother
knew
they
could
not
do
at
all
without
him
and
tried
to
fulfil
the
charge
committed
into
his
hands
at
length
one
day
for
the
thought
seemed
to
strike
them
simultaneously
they
conferred
together
about
giving
a
great
entertainment
in
their
grandest
rooms
to
any
of
their
neighbours
who
chose
to
come
or
indeed
to
any
inhabitants
of
the
earth
or
air
who
would
visit
them
they
were
too
proud
to
reflect
that
some
company
might
defile
even
the
dwellers
in
what
was
undoubtedly
the
finest
palace
on
the
face
of
the
earth
but
what
made
the
thing
worse
was
that
the
old
tradition
said
that
these
rooms
were
to
be
kept
entirely
for
the
use
of
the
owner
of
the
castle
and
indeed
whenever
they
entered
them
such
was
the
effect
of
their
loftiness
and
grandeur
upon
their
minds
that
they
always
thought
of
the
old
story
and
could
not
help
believing
it
nor
would
the
brother
permit
them
to
forget
it
now
but
appearing
suddenly
amongst
them
when
they
had
no
expectation
of
being
interrupted
by
him
he
rebuked
them
both
for
the
indiscriminate
nature
of
their
invitation
and
for
the
intention
of
introducing
any
one
not
to
speak
of
some
who
would
doubtless
make
their
appearance
on
the
evening
in
question
into
the
rooms
kept
sacred
for
the
use
of
the
unknown
father
but
by
this
time
their
talk
with
each
other
had
so
excited
their
expectations
of
enjoyment
which
had
previously
been
strong
enough
that
anger
sprung
up
within
them
at
the
thought
of
being
deprived
of
their
hopes
and
they
looked
each
other
in
the
eyes
and
the
look
said
are
many
and
he
is
one
let
us
get
rid
of
him
for
he
is
always
finding
fault
and
thwarting
us
in
the
most
innocent
pleasures
as
if
we
would
wish
to
do
anything
wrong
so
without
a
word
spoken
they
rushed
upon
him
and
although
he
was
stronger
than
any
of
them
and
struggled
hard
at
first
yet
they
overcame
him
at
last
indeed
some
of
them
thought
he
yielded
to
their
violence
long
before
they
had
the
mastery
of
him
and
this
very
submission
terrified
the
more
amongst
them
however
they
bound
him
carried
him
down
many
stairs
and
having
remembered
an
iron
staple
in
the
wall
of
a
certain
vault
with
a
thick
rusty
chain
attached
to
it
they
bore
him
thither
and
made
the
chain
fast
around
him
there
they
left
him
shutting
the
great
gnarring
brazen
door
of
the
vault
as
they
departed
for
the
upper
regions
of
the
castle
now
all
was
in
a
tumult
of
preparation
every
one
was
talking
of
the
coming
festivity
but
no
one
spoke
of
the
deed
they
had
done
a
sudden
paleness
overspread
the
face
now
of
one
and
now
of
another
but
it
passed
away
and
no
one
took
any
notice
of
it
they
only
plied
the
task
of
the
moment
the
more
energetically
messengers
were
sent
far
and
near
not
to
individuals
or
families
but
publishing
in
all
places
of
concourse
a
general
invitation
to
any
who
chose
to
come
on
a
certain
day
and
partake
for
certain
succeeding
days
of
the
hospitality
of
the
dwellers
in
the
castle
many
were
the
preparations
immediately
begun
for
complying
with
the
invitation
but
the
noblest
of
their
neighbours
refused
to
appear
not
from
pride
but
because
of
the
unsuitableness
and
carelessness
of
such
a
mode
with
some
of
them
it
was
an
old
condition
in
the
tenure
of
their
estates
that
they
should
go
to
no
one
dwelling
except
visited
in
person
and
expressly
solicited
others
knowing
what
sort
of
persons
would
be
there
and
that
from
a
certain
physical
antipathy
they
could
scarcely
breathe
in
their
company
made
up
their
minds
at
once
not
to
go
yet
multitudes
many
of
them
beautiful
and
innocent
as
well
as
gay
resolved
to
appear
meanwhile
the
great
rooms
of
the
castle
were
got
in
readiness
that
is
they
proceeded
to
deface
them
with
decorations
for
there
was
a
solemnity
and
stateliness
about
them
in
their
ordinary
condition
which
was
at
once
felt
to
be
unsuitable
for
the
company
so
soon
to
move
about
in
them
with
the
carelessness
with
which
men
walk
abroad
within
the
great
heavens
and
hills
and
clouds
one
day
while
the
workmen
were
busy
the
eldest
sister
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
happened
to
enter
she
knew
not
why
suddenly
the
great
idea
of
the
mighty
halls
dawned
upon
her
and
filled
her
soul
the
decorations
vanished
from
her
view
and
she
felt
as
if
she
stood
in
her
father
presence
she
was
at
one
elevated
and
humbled
as
suddenly
the
idea
faded
and
fled
and
she
beheld
but
the
gaudy
festoons
and
draperies
and
paintings
which
disfigured
the
grandeur
she
wept
and
sped
away
now
it
was
too
late
to
interfere
and
things
must
take
their
course
she
would
have
been
but
a
to
those
who
saw
but
the
pleasure
before
them
she
had
not
been
present
when
her
brother
was
imprisoned
and
indeed
for
some
days
had
been
so
wrapt
in
her
own
business
that
she
had
taken
but
little
heed
of
anything
that
was
going
on
but
they
all
expected
her
to
show
herself
when
the
company
was
gathered
and
they
had
applied
to
her
for
advice
at
various
times
during
their
operations
at
length
the
expected
hour
arrived
and
the
company
began
to
assemble
it
was
a
warm
summer
evening
the
dark
lake
reflected
the
clouds
in
the
west
and
through
the
flush
rowed
many
gaily
painted
boats
with
various
coloured
flags
towards
the
massy
rock
on
which
the
castle
stood
the
trees
and
flowers
seemed
already
asleep
and
breathing
forth
their
sweet
laughter
and
low
voices
rose
from
the
breast
of
the
lake
to
the
ears
of
the
youths
and
maidens
looking
forth
expectant
from
the
lofty
windows
they
went
down
to
the
broad
platform
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
front
of
the
door
to
receive
their
visitors
by
degrees
the
festivities
of
the
evening
commenced
the
same
smiles
flew
forth
both
at
eyes
and
lips
darting
like
beams
through
the
gathering
crowd
music
from
unseen
sources
now
rolled
in
billows
now
crept
in
ripples
through
the
sea
of
air
that
filled
the
lofty
rooms
and
in
the
dancing
halls
when
hand
took
hand
and
form
and
motion
were
moulded
and
swayed
by
the
indwelling
music
it
governed
not
these
alone
but
as
the
ruling
spirit
of
the
place
every
new
burst
of
music
for
a
new
dance
swept
before
it
a
new
and
accordant
odour
and
dyed
the
flames
that
glowed
in
the
lofty
lamps
with
a
new
and
accordant
stain
the
floors
bent
beneath
the
feet
of
the
dancers
but
twice
in
the
evening
some
of
the
inmates
started
and
the
pallor
occasionally
common
to
the
household
overspread
their
faces
for
they
felt
underneath
them
a
to
the
dance
as
if
the
floor
rose
slightly
to
answer
their
feet
and
all
the
time
their
brother
lay
below
in
the
dungeon
like
john
the
baptist
in
the
castle
of
herod
when
the
lords
and
captains
sat
around
and
the
daughter
of
herodias
danced
before
them
outside
all
around
the
castle
brooded
the
dark
night
unheeded
for
the
clouds
had
come
up
from
all
sides
and
were
crowding
together
overhead
in
the
unfrequent
pauses
of
the
music
they
might
have
heard
now
and
then
the
gusty
rush
of
a
lonely
wind
coming
and
going
no
one
could
know
whence
or
whither
born
and
dying
unexpected
and
unregarded
but
when
the
festivities
were
at
their
height
when
the
external
and
passing
confidence
which
is
produced
between
superficial
natures
by
a
common
pleasure
was
at
the
full
a
sudden
crash
of
thunder
quelled
the
music
as
the
thunder
quells
the
noise
of
the
uplifted
sea
the
windows
were
driven
in
and
torrents
of
rain
carried
in
the
folds
of
a
rushing
wind
poured
into
the
halls
the
lights
were
swept
away
and
the
great
rooms
now
dark
within
were
darkened
yet
more
by
the
dazzling
shoots
of
flame
from
the
vault
of
blackness
overhead
those
that
ventured
to
look
out
of
the
windows
saw
in
the
blue
brilliancy
of
the
jets
of
lightning
the
lake
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
ordinarily
so
still
and
so
dark
lighted
up
not
on
the
surface
only
but
down
to
half
its
depth
so
that
as
it
tossed
in
the
wind
like
a
tortured
sea
of
writhing
flames
or
incandescent
serpents
of
brass
they
could
not
tell
whether
a
strong
phosphorescence
did
not
issue
from
the
transparent
body
of
the
waters
as
if
earth
and
sky
lightened
together
one
consenting
source
of
flaming
utterance
sad
was
the
condition
of
the
late
plastic
mass
of
living
form
that
had
flowed
into
shape
at
the
will
and
law
of
the
music
broken
into
individuals
the
common
transfusing
spirit
withdrawn
they
stood
drenched
cold
and
benumbed
with
clinging
garments
light
order
harmony
purpose
departed
and
chaos
restored
the
issuings
of
life
turned
back
on
their
sources
chilly
and
dead
and
in
every
heart
reigned
the
falsest
of
despairing
convictions
that
this
was
the
only
reality
and
that
was
but
a
dream
the
eldest
sister
stood
with
clasped
hands
and
head
shivering
and
speechless
as
if
waiting
for
something
to
follow
nor
did
she
wait
long
a
terrible
flash
and
made
the
castle
rock
and
in
the
pausing
silence
that
followed
her
quick
sense
heard
the
rattling
of
a
chain
far
off
deep
down
and
soon
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
accompanied
with
the
clanking
of
iron
reached
her
ear
she
felt
that
her
brother
was
at
hand
even
in
the
darkness
and
amidst
the
bellowing
of
another
she
knew
that
he
had
entered
the
room
a
moment
after
a
continuous
pulsation
of
angry
blue
light
began
which
lasting
for
some
moments
revealed
him
standing
amidst
them
gaunt
haggard
and
motionless
his
hair
and
beard
untrimmed
his
face
ghastly
his
eyes
large
and
hollow
the
light
seemed
to
gather
around
him
as
a
centre
indeed
some
believed
that
it
throbbed
and
radiated
from
his
person
and
not
from
the
stormy
heavens
above
them
the
lightning
had
rent
the
wall
of
his
prison
and
released
the
iron
staple
of
his
chain
which
he
had
wound
about
him
like
a
girdle
in
his
hand
he
carried
an
iron
which
he
had
found
on
the
floor
of
the
vault
more
terrified
at
his
aspect
than
at
all
the
violence
of
the
storm
the
visitors
with
many
a
shriek
and
cry
rushed
out
into
the
tempestuous
night
by
degrees
the
storm
died
away
its
last
flash
revealed
the
forms
of
the
brothers
and
sisters
lying
prostrate
with
their
faces
on
the
floor
and
that
fearful
shape
standing
motionless
amidst
them
still
morning
dawned
and
there
they
lay
and
there
he
stood
but
at
a
word
from
him
they
arose
and
went
about
their
various
duties
though
listlessly
enough
the
eldest
sister
was
the
last
to
rise
and
when
she
did
it
was
only
by
a
terrible
effort
that
she
was
able
to
reach
her
room
where
she
fell
again
on
the
floor
there
she
remained
lying
for
days
the
brother
caused
the
doors
of
the
great
suite
of
rooms
to
be
closed
leaving
them
just
as
they
were
with
all
the
childish
adornment
scattered
about
and
the
rain
still
falling
in
through
the
shattered
windows
let
them
lie
said
he
the
rain
and
frost
have
cleansed
them
of
paint
and
drapery
no
storm
can
hurt
the
pillars
and
arches
of
these
halls
the
hours
of
this
day
went
heavily
the
storm
was
gone
but
the
rain
was
left
the
passion
had
departed
but
the
tears
remained
behind
dull
and
dark
the
low
misty
clouds
brooded
over
the
castle
and
the
lake
and
shut
out
all
the
neighbourhood
even
if
they
had
climbed
to
the
loftiest
known
turret
they
would
have
found
it
swathed
in
a
garment
of
clinging
vapour
affording
no
refreshment
to
the
eye
and
no
hope
to
the
heart
there
was
one
lofty
tower
that
rose
sheer
a
hundred
feet
above
the
rest
and
from
which
the
fog
could
have
been
seen
lying
in
a
grey
mass
beneath
but
that
tower
they
had
not
yet
discovered
nor
another
close
beside
it
the
top
of
which
was
never
seen
nor
could
be
for
the
highest
clouds
of
heaven
clustered
continually
around
it
the
rain
fell
continuously
though
not
heavily
without
and
within
too
there
were
clouds
from
which
dropped
the
tears
which
are
the
rain
of
the
spirit
all
the
good
of
life
seemed
for
the
time
departed
and
their
souls
lived
but
as
leafless
trees
that
had
forgotten
the
joy
of
the
summer
and
whom
no
wind
prophetic
of
spring
had
yet
visited
they
moved
about
mechanically
and
had
not
strength
enough
left
to
wish
to
die
the
next
day
the
clouds
were
higher
and
a
little
wind
blew
through
such
loopholes
in
the
turrets
as
the
false
improvements
of
the
inmates
had
not
yet
filled
with
glass
shutting
out
as
the
storm
so
the
serene
visitings
of
the
heavens
throughout
the
day
the
brother
took
various
opportunities
of
addressing
a
gentle
command
now
to
one
and
now
to
another
of
his
family
it
was
obeyed
in
silence
the
wind
blew
fresher
through
the
loopholes
and
the
shattered
windows
of
the
great
rooms
and
found
its
way
by
unknown
passages
to
faces
and
eyes
hot
with
weeping
it
cooled
and
blessed
when
the
sun
arose
the
next
day
it
was
in
a
clear
sky
by
degrees
everything
fell
into
the
regularity
of
subordination
with
the
subordination
came
increase
of
freedom
the
steps
of
the
more
youthful
of
the
family
were
heard
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
corridors
more
light
and
quick
than
ever
before
their
brother
had
lost
the
terrors
of
aspect
produced
by
his
confinement
and
his
commands
were
issued
more
gently
and
oftener
with
a
smile
than
in
all
their
previous
history
by
degrees
his
presence
was
universally
felt
through
the
house
it
was
no
surprise
to
any
one
at
his
studies
to
see
him
by
his
side
when
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
though
he
had
not
before
known
that
he
was
in
the
room
and
although
some
dread
still
remained
it
was
rapidly
vanishing
before
the
advances
of
a
firm
friendship
without
immediately
ordering
their
labours
he
always
influenced
them
and
often
altered
their
direction
and
objects
the
change
soon
evident
in
the
household
was
remarkable
a
simpler
nobler
expression
was
visible
on
all
the
countenances
the
voices
of
the
men
were
deeper
and
yet
seemed
by
their
very
depth
more
feminine
than
before
while
the
voices
of
the
women
were
softer
and
sweeter
and
at
the
same
time
more
full
and
decided
now
the
eyes
had
often
an
expression
as
if
their
sight
was
absorbed
in
the
gaze
of
the
inward
eyes
and
when
the
eyes
of
two
met
there
passed
between
those
eyes
the
utterance
of
a
conviction
that
both
meant
the
same
thing
but
the
change
was
of
course
to
be
seen
more
clearly
though
not
more
evidently
in
individuals
one
of
the
brothers
for
instance
was
very
fond
of
astronomy
he
had
his
observatory
on
a
lofty
tower
which
stood
pretty
clear
of
the
others
towards
the
north
and
east
but
hitherto
his
astronomy
as
he
had
called
it
had
been
more
of
the
character
of
astrology
often
too
he
might
have
been
seen
directing
a
telescope
to
catch
the
rapid
transit
of
a
fiery
belonging
altogether
to
the
earthly
atmosphere
and
not
to
the
serene
heavens
he
had
to
learn
that
the
signs
of
the
air
are
not
the
signs
of
the
skies
nay
once
his
brother
surprised
him
in
the
act
of
examining
through
his
longest
tube
a
patch
of
burning
heath
upon
a
distant
hill
but
now
he
was
diligent
from
morning
till
night
in
the
study
of
the
laws
of
the
truth
that
has
to
do
with
stars
and
when
the
curtain
of
the
sunlight
was
about
to
rise
from
before
the
heavenly
worlds
which
it
had
hidden
all
day
long
he
might
be
seen
preparing
his
instruments
with
that
solemn
countenance
with
which
it
becometh
one
to
look
into
the
mysterious
harmonies
of
nature
now
he
learned
what
law
and
order
and
truth
are
what
consent
and
harmony
mean
how
the
individual
may
find
his
own
end
in
a
higher
end
where
law
and
freedom
mean
the
same
thing
and
the
purest
certainty
exists
without
the
slightest
constraint
thus
he
stood
on
the
earth
and
looked
to
the
heavens
another
who
had
been
much
given
to
searching
out
the
hollow
places
and
recesses
in
the
foundations
of
the
castle
and
who
was
often
to
be
found
with
compass
and
ruler
working
away
at
a
chart
of
the
same
which
he
had
been
in
process
of
constructing
now
came
to
the
conclusion
that
only
by
ascending
the
upper
regions
of
his
abode
could
he
become
capable
of
understanding
what
lay
beneath
and
that
in
all
probability
one
clear
prospect
from
the
top
of
the
highest
attainable
turret
over
the
castle
as
it
lay
below
would
reveal
more
of
the
idea
of
its
internal
construction
than
a
year
spent
in
wandering
through
its
subterranean
vaults
but
the
fact
was
that
the
desire
to
ascend
wakening
within
him
had
made
him
forget
what
was
beneath
and
having
laid
aside
his
chart
for
a
time
at
least
he
was
now
to
be
met
in
every
quarter
of
the
upper
parts
searching
and
striving
upward
now
in
one
direction
now
in
another
and
seeking
as
he
went
the
best
outlooks
into
the
clear
air
of
outer
realities
and
they
began
to
discover
that
they
were
all
meditating
different
aspects
of
the
same
thing
and
they
brought
together
their
various
discoveries
and
recognized
the
likeness
between
them
and
the
one
thing
often
explained
the
other
and
combining
with
it
helped
to
a
third
they
grew
in
consequence
more
and
more
friendly
and
loving
so
that
every
now
and
then
one
turned
to
another
and
said
as
in
surprise
you
are
my
brother
you
are
my
sister
and
yet
they
had
always
known
it
the
change
reached
to
all
one
who
lived
on
the
air
of
sweet
sounds
and
who
was
almost
always
to
be
found
seated
by
her
harp
or
some
other
instrument
had
till
the
late
storm
been
generally
merry
and
playful
though
sometimes
sad
but
for
a
long
time
after
that
she
was
often
found
weeping
and
playing
little
simple
airs
which
she
had
heard
in
childhood
backward
longings
followed
by
fresh
tears
before
long
however
a
new
element
manifested
itself
in
her
music
it
became
yet
more
wild
and
sometimes
retained
all
its
sadness
but
it
was
mingled
with
anticipation
and
hope
the
past
and
the
future
merged
in
one
and
while
memory
yet
brought
the
expectation
threw
the
rainbow
across
its
bosom
and
all
was
uttered
in
her
music
which
rose
and
swelled
now
to
defiance
now
to
victory
then
died
in
a
torrent
of
weeping
as
to
the
eldest
sister
it
was
many
days
before
she
recovered
from
the
shock
at
length
one
day
her
brother
came
to
her
took
her
by
the
hand
led
her
to
an
open
window
and
told
her
to
seat
herself
by
it
and
look
out
she
did
so
but
at
first
saw
nothing
more
than
an
unsympathizing
blaze
of
sunlight
but
as
she
looked
the
horizon
widened
out
and
the
dome
of
the
sky
ascended
till
the
grandeur
seized
upon
her
soul
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
wept
now
the
heavens
seemed
to
bend
lovingly
over
her
and
to
stretch
out
wide
to
embrace
her
the
earth
lay
like
the
bosom
of
an
infinite
love
beneath
her
and
the
wind
kissed
her
cheek
with
an
odour
of
roses
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
turned
in
an
agony
of
hope
expecting
to
behold
the
face
of
the
father
but
there
stood
only
her
brother
looking
calmly
though
lovingly
on
her
emotion
she
turned
again
to
the
window
on
the
hilltops
rested
the
sky
heaven
and
earth
were
one
and
the
prophecy
awoke
in
her
soul
that
from
betwixt
them
would
the
steps
of
the
father
approach
hitherto
she
had
seen
but
beauty
now
she
beheld
truth
often
had
she
looked
on
such
clouds
as
these
and
loved
the
strange
ethereal
curves
into
which
the
winds
moulded
them
and
had
smiled
as
her
little
pet
sister
told
her
what
curious
animals
she
saw
in
them
and
tried
to
point
them
out
to
her
now
they
were
as
troops
of
angels
jubilant
over
her
new
birth
for
they
sang
in
her
soul
of
beauty
and
truth
and
love
she
looked
down
and
her
little
sister
knelt
beside
her
she
was
a
curious
child
with
black
glittering
eyes
and
dark
hair
at
the
mercy
of
every
wandering
wind
a
frolicsome
daring
girl
who
laughed
more
than
she
smiled
she
was
generally
in
attendance
on
her
sister
and
was
always
finding
and
bringing
her
strange
things
she
never
pulled
a
primrose
but
she
knew
the
haunts
of
all
the
orchis
tribe
and
brought
from
them
bees
and
butterflies
innumerable
as
offerings
to
her
sister
curious
moths
and
were
her
greatest
delight
and
she
loved
the
stars
because
they
were
like
the
but
the
change
had
affected
her
too
for
her
sister
saw
that
her
eyes
had
lost
their
glittering
look
and
had
become
more
liquid
and
transparent
and
from
that
time
she
often
observed
that
her
gaiety
was
more
gentle
her
smile
more
frequent
her
laugh
less
and
although
she
was
as
wild
as
ever
there
was
more
elegance
in
her
motions
and
more
music
in
her
voice
and
she
clung
to
her
sister
with
far
greater
fondness
than
before
the
land
reposed
in
the
embrace
of
the
warm
summer
days
the
clouds
of
heaven
nestled
around
the
towers
of
the
castle
and
the
hearts
of
its
inmates
became
conscious
of
a
warm
atmosphere
of
a
presence
of
love
they
began
to
feel
like
the
children
of
a
household
when
the
mother
is
at
home
their
faces
and
forms
grew
daily
more
and
more
beautiful
till
they
wondered
as
they
gazed
on
each
other
as
they
walked
in
the
gardens
of
the
castle
or
in
the
country
around
they
were
often
visited
especially
the
eldest
sister
by
sounds
that
no
one
heard
but
themselves
issuing
from
woods
and
waters
and
by
forms
of
love
that
lightened
out
of
flowers
and
grass
and
great
rocks
now
and
then
the
young
children
would
come
in
with
a
slow
stately
step
and
with
great
eyes
that
looked
as
if
they
would
devour
all
the
creation
say
that
they
had
met
the
father
amongst
the
trees
and
that
he
had
kissed
them
added
one
of
them
once
grew
so
big
but
when
the
others
went
out
to
look
they
could
see
no
one
and
some
said
it
must
have
been
the
brother
who
grew
more
and
more
beautiful
and
loving
and
reverend
and
who
had
lost
all
traces
of
hardness
so
that
they
wondered
they
could
ever
have
thought
him
stern
and
harsh
but
the
eldest
sister
held
her
peace
and
looked
up
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
can
tell
thought
she
the
little
children
know
more
about
it
than
we
often
at
sunrise
might
be
heard
their
hymn
of
praise
to
their
unseen
father
whom
they
felt
to
be
near
though
they
saw
him
not
some
words
thereof
once
reached
my
ear
through
the
folds
of
the
music
in
which
they
floated
as
in
an
upward
snowstorm
of
sweet
sounds
and
these
are
some
of
the
words
i
heard
but
there
was
much
i
seemed
to
hear
which
i
could
not
understand
and
some
things
which
i
understood
but
can
not
utter
again
thank
thee
that
we
have
a
father
and
not
a
maker
that
thou
hast
begotten
us
and
not
moulded
us
as
images
of
clay
that
we
have
come
forth
of
thy
heart
and
have
not
been
fashioned
by
thy
hands
it
be
so
only
the
heart
of
a
father
is
able
to
create
we
rejoice
in
it
and
bless
thee
that
we
know
it
we
thank
thee
for
thyself
be
what
thou
art
our
root
and
life
our
beginning
and
end
our
all
in
all
come
home
to
us
thou
livest
therefore
we
live
in
thy
light
we
see
thou
art
that
is
all
our
song
thus
they
worship
and
love
and
wait
their
hope
and
expectation
grow
ever
stronger
and
brighter
that
one
day
ere
long
the
father
will
show
himself
amongst
them
and
thenceforth
dwell
in
his
own
house
for
evermore
what
was
once
but
an
old
legend
has
become
the
one
desire
of
their
hearts
and
the
loftiest
hope
is
the
surest
of
being
fulfilled
thank
you
heartily
said
the
curate
i
will
choose
another
time
to
tell
you
how
much
i
have
enjoyed
your
parable
which
is
altogether
to
my
mind
and
far
beyond
anything
i
could
do
bloomfield
returned
no
answer
but
his
countenance
showed
that
he
was
far
from
hearing
this
praise
unmoved
the
faces
of
the
rest
showed
that
they
too
had
listened
with
pleasure
and
adela
face
shone
as
if
she
had
received
more
than
delight
hope
namely
and
onward
impulse
the
colonel
alone
i
forgot
to
say
that
cathcart
had
a
headache
and
did
not
come
seemed
to
have
been
left
behind
i
am
a
stupid
old
fellow
i
believe
said
he
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
it
seemed
all
the
time
to
be
telling
me
in
one
breath
something
i
knew
and
something
i
did
and
know
i
wish
i
could
express
what
i
mean
but
it
puzzled
me
too
much
for
that
although
every
now
and
then
it
sounded
very
beautiful
indeed
i
will
try
and
tell
you
what
it
said
to
me
sometime
papa
said
adela
thank
you
my
child
i
should
much
like
to
understand
it
i
believe
i
have
done
my
duty
by
my
king
and
country
but
a
man
has
to
learn
a
good
deal
after
all
that
is
over
and
done
with
and
i
suppose
it
is
never
too
late
to
begin
mr
armstrong
on
the
contrary
i
not
merely
believe
that
no
future
time
can
be
so
good
as
the
present
but
i
am
inclined
to
assert
that
no
past
time
could
have
been
so
good
as
the
present
this
seems
to
be
a
paradox
but
i
think
i
could
explain
it
very
easily
i
find
however
that
the
ladies
are
looking
as
if
they
wanted
to
go
home
and
i
am
quite
ready
armstrong
but
while
the
ladies
put
their
bonnets
on
just
let
smith
see
your
schoolroom
bloomfield
as
an
inhabitant
of
purleybridge
i
already
begin
to
be
proud
of
it
the
ladies
did
go
to
put
on
their
bonnets
i
followed
bloomfield
and
the
colonel
into
the
schoolroom
and
the
curate
followed
me
but
after
we
had
looked
about
us
and
remarked
on
the
things
about
for
five
minutes
finding
i
had
left
my
handkerchief
in
the
i
went
back
to
fetch
it
the
door
was
open
and
i
saw
adela
no
bonnet
on
her
head
yet
standing
face
to
face
with
harry
they
were
alone
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
what
i
should
do
and
while
i
hesitated
i
could
not
help
seeing
the
arm
of
the
doctor
curved
and
as
if
it
would
gladly
have
folded
about
her
and
his
face
droop
and
droop
till
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
half
a
foot
from
hers
now
as
far
as
my
seeing
this
was
concerned
there
was
no
harm
done
but
behind
me
came
the
curate
and
the
schoolmaster
and
they
had
eyes
in
their
heads
at
least
equal
to
mine
well
no
great
harm
yet
and
just
far
enough
down
the
stair
to
see
into
the
appeared
their
wives
who
could
not
fail
to
see
the
unconscious
pair
at
least
as
well
as
we
men
below
still
there
was
no
great
harm
done
for
cathcart
was
at
home
as
i
have
said
but
referens
excuse
the
recondite
quotation
at
the
same
moment
the
form
of
the
colonel
appeared
looking
over
the
heads
of
all
before
him
right
in
at
the
door
and
full
at
the
young
sinners
who
had
heard
no
sound
along
the
matted
passage
here
a
go
said
i
to
myself
not
aloud
observe
for
it
was
slang
for
just
think
of
a
man
like
harry
caught
thus
in
a
perfect
trap
of
converging
looks
as
if
from
a
sudden
feeling
of
hostile
presence
he
glanced
round
and
stood
erect
the
poor
fellow
face
at
once
flushed
as
red
as
shame
could
make
it
but
he
neither
lost
his
nor
sought
to
escape
under
cover
of
a
useless
pretence
he
turned
to
the
colonel
colonel
cathcart
he
said
i
will
choose
a
more
suitable
time
to
make
my
apology
i
wish
you
good
night
he
bowed
to
us
all
not
choosing
to
risk
a
refusal
of
his
hand
by
the
colonel
and
went
quickly
out
of
the
house
the
colonel
stood
for
some
moments
which
felt
to
me
like
minutes
as
if
he
had
just
mounted
guard
at
the
door
his
face
was
perfectly
expressionless
we
men
felt
very
much
like
stale
oysters
and
would
rather
have
skipped
that
same
portion
of
our
inevitable
existence
what
the
ladies
felt
i
do
not
pretend
being
an
old
bachelor
to
divine
adela
pale
as
death
fled
up
the
stair
the
only
thing
left
for
the
rest
of
us
was
to
act
as
much
as
possible
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
and
get
out
of
the
way
before
the
poor
girl
came
down
again
as
soon
as
i
got
home
i
went
to
my
own
room
and
thus
avoided
the
with
my
host
which
generally
closed
our
evenings
the
colonel
went
up
to
his
daughter
room
and
remained
there
for
nearly
an
hour
adela
was
not
at
the
the
next
morning
her
father
looked
very
gloomy
and
cathcart
grimly
satisfied
with
told
you
written
on
her
face
as
plainly
as
i
have
now
written
it
on
the
paper
how
she
came
to
know
anything
about
it
i
can
only
conjecture
chapter
viii
what
next
harry
called
early
and
was
informed
that
the
colonel
was
not
at
home
something
the
matter
armstrong
said
beeves
master
not
at
home
to
you
he
says
nor
any
other
day
till
he
countermands
the
order
that
was
the
word
sir
i
sure
i
am
very
sorry
sir
so
am
i
said
harry
how
your
mistress
have
seen
her
sir
emma
says
she
poorly
but
she
is
down
emma
looks
as
if
she
knew
something
and
would
tell
it
i
get
it
out
of
her
though
sir
we
be
having
that
old
wade
coming
about
the
house
again
i
afeard
sir
no
good
at
all
events
you
will
let
your
master
know
that
i
have
called
said
harry
as
he
turned
disconsolately
to
take
his
departure
that
i
will
sir
and
i
be
sure
he
hears
me
he
rather
deaf
sometimes
you
know
sir
thank
you
beeves
good
morning
now
what
could
have
been
harry
intention
in
calling
upon
the
colonel
why
as
he
had
said
himself
to
make
an
apology
but
what
kind
of
apology
could
he
make
clearly
there
was
only
one
that
would
satisfy
all
parties
and
that
must
be
in
the
form
of
a
request
to
be
allowed
to
pay
his
addresses
that
used
to
be
the
phrase
in
my
time
i
do
know
the
young
ladies
slang
for
it
to
adela
did
i
say
all
this
was
just
the
one
form
affairs
might
take
which
would
least
of
all
satisfy
the
colonel
i
believe
with
all
his
rigid
proprieties
he
would
have
preferred
the
confession
that
the
doctor
had
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
attempt
to
snatch
a
kiss
a
theft
of
which
i
can
not
imagine
a
gentleman
guilty
least
of
all
a
doctor
from
his
patient
which
relation
no
doubt
the
colonel
persisted
in
regarding
as
the
sole
possible
and
everlastingly
permanent
one
between
adela
and
harry
the
former
was
however
the
only
apology
harry
could
make
and
evidently
the
colonel
expected
it
when
he
refused
to
see
him
but
why
should
he
refuse
to
see
him
the
doctor
was
not
on
an
equality
with
the
colonel
well
to
borrow
a
form
from
the
shorter
catechism
wherein
consisted
the
difference
between
the
colonel
and
the
doctor
the
difference
between
the
colonel
and
the
doctor
consisted
chiefly
in
this
that
whereas
the
colonel
lived
by
the
wits
of
his
ancestors
harry
lived
by
his
own
and
therefore
was
not
so
respectable
as
the
colonel
or
in
other
words
the
colonel
inherited
a
good
estate
with
the
ordinary
quantity
of
brains
while
harry
inherited
a
good
education
and
an
extraordinary
quantity
of
brains
so
of
course
it
was
very
presumptuous
in
harry
to
aspire
to
the
hand
of
miss
cathcart
in
the
forenoon
the
curate
called
upon
me
and
was
shown
into
the
library
where
i
was
what
that
scapegrace
brother
of
mine
been
doing
smith
he
asked
the
moment
he
entered
wanting
to
marry
adela
i
replied
what
has
he
done
called
this
morning
and
seen
colonel
cathcart
no
not
at
home
in
a
social
sense
not
at
home
in
a
moral
sense
very
far
from
at
home
in
a
natural
sense
seated
in
his
own
with
his
own
work
on
the
peninsular
war
open
on
the
table
before
him
would
see
him
no
what
he
to
do
then
i
think
we
had
better
leave
that
to
him
harry
is
not
the
man
i
take
him
for
if
he
does
know
his
own
way
better
than
you
or
i
can
tell
him
you
right
smith
how
miss
cathcart
i
have
never
seen
her
so
well
certainly
she
did
not
come
down
to
breakfast
but
i
believe
that
was
merely
from
shyness
she
appeared
in
the
directly
after
and
although
it
was
evident
she
had
been
crying
her
step
was
as
light
and
her
colour
as
fresh
as
her
lover
even
could
wish
to
see
them
then
she
is
not
without
hope
in
the
matter
if
she
loves
him
and
i
think
she
does
she
is
not
without
hope
but
i
do
not
think
the
fact
of
her
looking
well
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
that
for
some
mental
troubles
will
favour
the
return
of
bodily
health
they
will
at
least
give
one
an
interest
in
life
then
you
think
her
father
has
given
in
a
little
about
it
i
do
believe
if
her
illness
and
she
were
both
of
an
ordinary
kind
she
would
gain
her
point
now
by
taking
to
her
bed
but
from
what
i
know
of
adela
she
would
scorn
and
resist
that
well
we
must
let
matters
take
their
course
harry
is
worthy
of
the
best
wife
in
christendom
i
believe
it
and
more
if
adela
will
make
that
best
wife
i
think
he
will
have
the
best
wife
but
we
must
have
patience
next
morning
a
letter
arrived
from
harry
to
the
colonel
i
have
seen
it
and
it
was
to
this
effect
my
dear
sir
as
you
will
not
see
me
i
am
forced
to
write
to
you
let
my
earnest
entreaty
to
be
allowed
to
address
your
daughter
cover
if
it
can
not
make
up
for
my
inadvertence
of
the
other
evening
i
am
very
sorry
i
have
offended
you
if
you
will
receive
me
i
trust
you
will
not
find
it
hard
to
forget
yours
to
this
the
colonel
replied
sir
it
is
at
least
useless
if
not
worse
to
apply
for
an
post
permission
what
i
might
have
answered
had
the
courtesies
of
society
been
observed
it
may
be
easy
for
me
to
determine
but
it
is
useless
now
to
repeat
allow
me
to
say
that
i
consider
such
behaviour
of
a
medical
practitioner
towards
a
young
lady
his
patient
altogether
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
as
every
member
of
a
learned
profession
is
supposed
to
be
i
have
the
honour
i
returned
the
curate
call
and
while
we
were
sitting
in
his
study
in
walked
harry
with
a
rather
rueful
countenance
what
do
you
say
to
that
ralph
said
he
handing
his
brother
the
letter
cool
replied
ralph
but
harry
my
boy
you
have
given
him
quite
the
upper
hand
of
you
how
could
you
be
so
foolish
as
kiss
the
girl
there
and
then
i
did
said
harry
but
you
did
just
as
bad
you
were
going
to
do
it
i
do
think
i
was
but
somehow
those
great
eyes
of
hers
kept
pulling
and
pulling
my
head
so
that
i
do
know
what
i
was
going
to
do
i
remember
nothing
but
her
eyes
suddenly
a
scared
look
in
them
startled
me
and
i
saw
it
all
smith
was
it
so
very
dishonourable
of
me
you
are
the
best
judge
of
that
yourself
harry
i
answered
just
let
me
look
at
the
note
i
read
it
folded
it
up
carefully
and
returning
it
said
he
given
you
a
good
hold
of
him
there
it
is
really
too
bad
of
cathcart
being
a
downright
good
fellow
to
forget
that
he
ran
away
with
miss
selby
old
sir
george
the
baronet
daughter
neither
of
them
ever
repented
it
though
he
was
only
captain
cathcart
then
in
a
regiment
of
foot
too
and
was
not
even
next
heir
to
the
property
he
has
now
hurrah
cried
harry
stop
stop
that
does
make
it
a
bit
better
said
his
brother
i
suppose
you
mean
to
argue
with
him
on
that
ground
do
you
no
i
do
i
not
such
a
fool
but
if
i
be
forced
to
run
away
with
her
ca
complain
you
know
no
no
harry
my
boy
said
i
that
wo
do
it
would
break
the
old
man
heart
you
must
have
patience
for
a
while
yes
yes
i
know
what
i
mean
to
do
what
when
i
made
up
my
mind
i
never
ask
advice
it
only
bewilders
a
fellow
quite
right
hal
said
his
brother
only
do
do
anything
foolish
i
wo
do
anything
she
does
like
no
nor
anything
you
wo
like
yourself
afterwards
i
ventured
to
say
i
hope
not
returned
he
gravely
as
he
walked
out
too
much
absorbed
to
bid
either
of
us
it
was
now
more
than
time
that
i
should
return
to
town
but
i
could
not
leave
affairs
in
this
unsatisfactory
state
i
therefore
lingered
on
to
see
what
would
come
next
chapter
ix
generalship
the
next
day
harry
called
again
master
countermanded
the
order
doctor
he
at
home
not
a
bit
of
it
he
been
out
of
the
house
since
that
night
well
is
miss
cathcart
at
home
she
said
nothing
to
the
contrairy
sir
i
believe
she
at
home
i
know
she
out
in
the
garding
on
the
terridge
and
old
beeves
held
the
door
wide
open
as
if
to
say
do
stop
to
ask
any
questions
but
step
into
the
garden
which
harry
did
there
was
a
high
gravel
terrace
along
one
end
of
it
always
dry
and
sunny
when
there
was
any
sun
going
and
there
she
was
by
the
windows
of
her
papa
room
now
i
do
not
know
anything
that
passed
upon
that
terrace
how
should
i
know
neither
of
them
was
likely
to
tell
old
smith
and
i
wonder
at
the
clumsiness
of
novelists
in
pretending
to
reveal
all
that
said
and
all
that
answered
but
if
i
were
such
a
clumsy
novelist
i
should
like
to
invent
it
all
and
see
if
i
could
make
you
believe
every
word
of
it
this
is
what
i
would
invent
the
moment
adela
caught
sight
of
harry
she
cast
one
frightened
glance
up
to
her
father
windows
and
stood
waiting
he
lifted
his
hat
and
held
out
his
hand
she
took
it
neither
spoke
they
turned
together
and
walked
along
the
terrace
i
am
very
sorry
said
harry
at
last
are
you
what
for
because
i
got
you
into
a
scrape
oh
i
do
care
do
you
no
not
a
bit
i
did
mean
it
what
did
you
mean
it
did
look
like
it
i
know
look
like
what
adela
you
drive
me
crazy
it
was
all
your
fault
so
i
told
papa
and
he
was
angrier
than
ever
you
angel
it
was
your
fault
it
was
your
eyes
i
could
help
it
adela
i
love
you
dreadfully
i
glad
she
gave
a
sigh
as
of
relief
why
because
i
wished
you
would
but
i
do
deserve
it
a
great
clever
man
like
you
love
a
useless
girl
like
me
i
so
glad
but
your
papa
i
so
happy
i
ca
think
about
him
steadily
just
yet
adela
i
love
you
so
dearly
only
i
am
too
old
for
you
old
how
old
are
you
nearly
thirty
and
i
only
you
worth
one
and
a
half
of
me
yes
twenty
of
me
and
so
their
lips
played
with
the
ripples
of
love
while
their
hearts
were
heaving
with
the
ground
swell
of
its
tempest
now
what
i
do
know
about
is
this
the
colonel
came
in
his
and
slippers
and
found
beeves
flattening
his
nose
against
the
glass
of
the
beeves
said
the
colonel
sir
said
beeves
darting
around
and
confronting
his
master
with
a
face
purple
and
pale
from
the
sense
of
utter
unpreparedness
beeves
where
is
your
mistress
my
mistress
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
sure
sir
how
should
i
know
sir
i
let
her
out
shall
i
run
and
see
if
she
is
in
her
room
open
the
door
beeves
laid
violent
hold
upon
the
handle
of
the
door
and
pulled
and
twisted
but
always
took
care
to
pull
before
he
twisted
i
declare
if
that
stupid
ann
been
and
locked
it
it
aint
nice
in
the
garden
sir
leastways
without
goloshes
added
he
looking
down
at
his
master
slippers
now
the
colonel
understood
beeves
and
beeves
knew
that
he
understood
him
but
beeves
knew
likewise
that
the
colonel
would
not
give
in
to
the
possibility
of
his
servant
taking
such
liberties
with
him
never
mind
said
the
colonel
i
will
go
the
other
way
the
moment
he
was
out
of
sight
beeves
opened
the
and
began
gesticulating
like
a
madman
fully
persuaded
that
the
doctor
would
make
his
escape
but
so
far
from
being
prepared
to
run
away
harry
had
come
there
with
the
express
intention
of
forcing
a
conference
so
that
when
the
colonel
made
his
appearance
on
the
terrace
the
culprits
walked
slowly
towards
him
he
went
to
meet
them
with
long
military
strides
and
was
the
first
to
speak
armstrong
to
what
am
i
to
attribute
this
intrusion
chiefly
to
the
desire
of
seeing
you
colonel
cathcart
and
i
find
you
with
my
daughter
adela
go
adela
withdrew
at
once
you
denied
yourself
and
i
inquired
for
miss
cathcart
you
will
oblige
me
by
not
calling
again
surely
i
have
committed
no
fault
beyond
forgiveness
you
have
taken
advantage
of
your
admission
into
my
family
to
entrap
the
affections
of
my
daughter
colonel
cathcart
as
far
as
my
conscience
tells
me
i
have
not
behaved
unworthily
sir
is
it
not
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
to
use
such
professional
advantages
to
gain
the
favour
of
one
who
you
will
excuse
me
for
reminding
you
of
what
you
will
not
allow
me
to
forget
is
as
much
above
him
in
social
position
as
inferior
to
him
in
years
and
experience
is
it
always
unworthy
in
a
gentleman
to
aspire
to
a
lady
above
him
in
social
position
colonel
cathcart
the
honesty
of
the
colonel
checked
all
reply
to
this
harry
resumed
at
least
i
am
able
to
maintain
my
wife
in
what
may
be
considered
comfort
your
wife
exclaimed
the
colonel
his
anger
blazing
out
at
the
word
if
you
use
that
expression
with
any
prospective
reference
to
miss
cathcart
i
am
master
enough
in
my
own
family
to
insure
you
full
possession
of
the
presumption
i
wish
you
good
morning
the
angry
man
of
war
turned
on
his
slippered
heel
and
was
striding
away
one
word
i
beg
said
harry
the
colonel
had
too
much
courtesy
in
his
nature
not
to
stop
and
turn
half
towards
the
speaker
i
beg
to
assure
you
said
harry
that
i
shall
continue
to
cherish
the
hope
that
will
present
my
conduct
as
well
as
myself
in
a
more
favourable
light
to
colonel
cathcart
and
he
lifted
his
hat
and
walked
away
by
the
gate
by
jove
said
the
colonel
to
himself
notwithstanding
the
rage
he
was
in
the
fellow
can
express
himself
like
a
gentleman
anyhow
and
so
he
went
back
to
his
room
where
i
heard
him
pacing
about
for
hours
i
believe
he
found
that
his
better
self
was
not
to
be
so
easily
put
down
as
he
had
supposed
and
that
that
better
self
sided
with
adela
and
harry
chapter
x
an
unforeseen
foresight
what
else
is
a
providence
harry
went
about
his
work
as
usual
only
with
a
graver
face
adela
looked
very
sad
but
without
any
of
her
old
helpless
and
hopeless
air
her
health
was
quite
established
and
she
now
returned
all
the
attention
her
father
had
paid
to
fortunately
cathcart
had
gone
home
cunning
puss
some
of
my
readers
may
say
she
was
trying
to
coax
the
old
man
out
of
his
resolution
but
such
a
notion
would
be
quite
unjust
to
my
niece
she
was
more
in
danger
of
going
to
the
other
extreme
to
avoid
hypocrisy
but
she
had
the
divine
gift
of
knowing
what
any
one
she
loved
was
feeling
and
thinking
and
she
knew
that
her
father
was
suffering
and
all
about
it
the
old
man
pace
grew
heavier
the
lines
about
his
mouth
grew
deeper
he
sat
at
table
without
speaking
he
ate
very
little
and
drank
more
wine
adela
eyes
followed
his
every
action
i
could
see
that
sometimes
she
was
ready
to
rise
and
throw
her
arms
about
him
often
i
saw
in
her
lovely
eyes
that
peculiar
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
which
indicates
the
nearness
of
rain
and
once
or
twice
she
rose
and
left
the
room
as
if
to
save
her
from
an
otherwise
unavoidable
exposure
of
her
feelings
the
gloom
fell
upon
the
servants
too
beeves
waited
in
a
way
that
showed
he
was
determined
to
do
his
duty
although
it
should
bring
small
pleasure
with
it
he
took
every
opportunity
of
unburdening
his
bosom
to
me
it
just
like
when
died
said
he
the
very
cocks
walk
about
the
yard
as
if
they
had
in
their
tails
everybody
looks
ready
to
hang
hisself
except
you
smith
and
that
a
comfort
the
fact
was
that
i
had
very
little
doubt
as
to
how
it
would
all
end
but
i
would
not
interfere
for
i
saw
that
it
would
be
much
better
for
the
colonel
heart
and
conscience
to
right
themselves
than
that
he
should
be
persuaded
to
anything
it
was
very
hard
for
him
he
had
led
his
regiment
to
victory
and
glory
he
had
charged
and
captured
many
a
gun
he
had
driven
the
enemy
out
of
many
a
boldly
defended
entrenchment
and
was
it
not
hard
that
he
could
not
drive
the
of
a
country
surgeon
out
of
the
bosom
of
his
little
girl
it
was
hard
that
he
could
not
but
it
would
have
been
a
deal
harder
if
he
could
he
had
nursed
and
loved
and
petted
and
spoiled
her
and
she
care
for
a
man
whom
he
disliked
but
here
the
old
man
was
mistaken
he
did
not
dislike
harry
armstrong
he
admired
and
honoured
him
he
almost
loved
him
for
his
gallant
devotion
to
his
duty
he
would
have
been
proud
of
him
for
a
son
but
not
for
a
he
would
not
have
minded
adopting
him
or
doing
anything
giving
him
adela
there
was
a
great
deal
of
pride
left
in
the
old
soldier
and
that
must
be
taken
out
of
him
we
shall
all
have
to
thank
god
for
the
whip
of
scorpions
which
if
needful
will
do
its
part
to
drive
us
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
how
happy
the
dear
old
man
will
be
i
said
to
myself
when
he
just
yields
this
last
castle
of
selfishness
and
walks
unhoused
into
the
new
childhood
of
which
god
takes
care
and
this
end
came
sooner
than
i
had
looked
for
it
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
go
when
i
told
adela
that
i
must
go
she
gave
me
a
look
in
which
lay
the
whole
story
in
light
and
in
tears
i
answered
with
a
pressure
of
her
hand
and
an
old
uncle
kiss
but
no
word
was
spoken
on
the
subject
i
had
a
final
cigar
with
the
curate
and
another
with
the
schoolmaster
bade
them
and
their
wives
told
them
all
would
come
right
if
we
only
had
patience
and
then
went
to
harry
but
he
was
in
the
country
and
i
thought
i
should
not
see
him
again
with
the
assistance
of
good
beeves
i
got
my
portmanteau
packed
that
night
i
was
going
to
start
about
ten
next
morning
it
was
long
before
i
got
to
sleep
and
i
heard
the
step
of
the
colonel
whose
room
was
below
mine
on
the
floor
going
up
and
down
up
and
down
all
the
time
till
slumber
came
at
last
and
muffled
me
we
met
at
breakfast
a
party
lugubrious
enough
beeves
waited
like
a
mute
the
colonel
ate
his
breakfast
like
an
offended
parent
adela
trifled
with
hers
like
one
who
had
other
things
to
think
about
and
i
ate
mine
like
a
parting
guest
who
was
being
anything
but
sped
when
the
postbag
was
brought
in
the
colonel
unlocked
it
mechanically
distributed
the
letters
opened
one
with
indifference
read
a
few
lines
and
with
a
groan
fell
back
in
his
chair
we
started
up
and
laid
him
on
the
sofa
with
the
privilege
of
an
old
friend
i
glanced
at
the
letter
and
found
that
a
certain
speculation
in
which
the
colonel
had
ventured
largely
had
utterly
failed
i
told
adela
enough
to
satisfy
her
as
to
the
nature
of
the
misfortune
we
feared
apoplexy
but
before
we
could
send
for
any
medical
man
he
opened
his
eyes
and
called
adela
he
clasped
her
to
his
bosom
and
then
tried
to
rise
but
fell
back
helpless
shall
we
send
for
dr
wade
said
adela
trembling
and
pale
as
death
dr
wade
faltered
the
old
man
with
a
perceptible
accent
of
scorn
which
shall
we
send
for
i
said
how
can
you
ask
he
answered
feebly
harry
armstrong
of
course
the
blood
rushed
into
adela
white
face
and
beeves
rushed
out
of
the
room
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
harry
was
with
us
adela
had
retired
he
made
a
few
inquiries
administered
some
medicine
he
had
brought
with
him
and
giving
orders
that
he
should
not
be
disturbed
for
a
couple
of
hours
left
him
with
the
injunction
to
keep
perfectly
quiet
take
my
traps
up
to
my
room
again
beeves
and
tell
the
he
wo
be
wanted
this
morning
thank
you
sir
said
beeves
i
do
know
what
we
should
do
without
you
sir
when
harry
returned
we
carried
the
colonel
up
to
his
own
room
and
beeves
got
him
to
bed
i
said
something
about
a
nurse
but
harry
said
there
was
no
one
so
fit
to
nurse
him
as
adela
the
poor
man
had
never
been
ill
before
and
i
daresay
he
would
have
been
very
rebellious
had
he
not
had
a
great
trouble
at
his
heart
to
quiet
him
he
was
as
submissive
as
could
be
desired
i
felt
sure
he
would
be
better
as
soon
as
he
had
told
adela
i
gave
harry
a
hint
of
the
matter
and
he
looked
very
much
as
if
he
would
shout
oh
jolly
but
he
did
not
towards
the
evening
the
colonel
called
his
daughter
to
his
bedside
and
said
addie
darling
i
have
hurt
you
dreadfully
oh
no
dear
papa
you
have
not
and
it
is
so
easy
to
put
it
all
right
you
know
she
added
turning
her
head
away
a
little
no
my
child
he
said
in
a
tone
full
of
nobody
can
put
it
right
i
have
made
us
both
beggars
addie
my
love
well
dearest
papa
you
can
bear
a
little
poverty
surely
it
not
of
myself
i
am
thinking
my
darling
do
do
me
that
injustice
or
i
shall
behave
like
a
fool
it
only
you
i
am
thinking
of
oh
is
that
all
papa
do
you
know
that
if
it
were
not
for
your
sake
i
could
sing
a
song
about
it
ah
you
do
know
what
you
make
so
light
of
poverty
is
not
so
easy
to
endure
papa
said
adela
solemnly
if
you
knew
how
awful
things
looked
to
me
a
little
while
ago
but
it
all
gone
now
the
whole
earth
black
and
frozen
to
the
heart
with
no
god
in
it
and
nothing
worth
living
for
you
would
not
wonder
that
i
take
the
prospect
of
poverty
with
absolute
indifference
yes
if
you
will
believe
me
with
something
of
a
strange
excitement
there
will
be
something
to
battle
with
and
beat
and
she
stretched
out
a
strong
beautiful
white
arm
from
which
the
loose
open
sleeve
fell
back
as
if
with
that
weapon
of
might
she
would
strike
poverty
to
the
earth
but
it
was
only
to
adjust
the
pillow
which
had
slipped
sideways
from
the
loved
head
but
armstrong
will
not
want
to
marry
you
now
addie
oh
wo
he
thought
adela
or
at
least
i
think
she
thought
so
but
she
said
rather
demurely
and
very
shyly
but
that
wo
be
any
worse
than
it
was
before
for
you
know
you
would
never
have
let
me
marry
him
anyhow
oh
yes
i
would
in
time
adela
i
am
not
such
a
brute
as
you
take
me
for
oh
you
dear
darling
papa
cried
the
poor
child
and
burst
into
tears
with
her
head
on
her
father
bosom
and
he
began
comforting
her
so
sweetly
that
you
would
have
thought
she
had
lost
everything
and
he
was
going
to
give
her
all
back
again
papa
papa
she
cried
i
will
work
for
you
i
will
be
your
servant
i
will
love
you
and
love
you
to
all
eternity
i
wo
leave
you
i
wo
indeed
what
it
matter
for
the
money
at
this
moment
the
doctor
entered
ah
he
said
this
wo
do
at
all
i
thought
you
would
have
made
a
better
nurse
miss
adela
there
you
are
both
crying
together
indeed
henry
said
adela
rather
comically
it
not
my
fault
he
would
cry
and
as
she
spoke
she
wiped
away
her
own
tears
but
he
looking
much
better
after
all
said
harry
allow
me
to
feel
your
pulse
the
patient
was
pronounced
much
better
fresh
orders
were
given
and
harry
took
his
leave
but
adela
felt
vexed
she
did
not
consider
that
he
knew
nothing
of
what
had
passed
between
her
father
and
her
to
the
warm
of
her
knowledge
he
came
in
wintry
and
cold
of
course
it
would
never
do
for
the
doctor
to
aggravate
his
patient
symptoms
by
making
love
to
his
daughter
but
ought
he
not
to
have
seen
that
it
was
all
right
between
them
now
how
often
we
feel
and
act
as
if
our
mood
were
the
atmosphere
of
the
world
it
may
be
a
cold
frost
within
us
when
our
friend
is
in
the
glow
of
a
summer
sunset
and
we
call
him
unsympathetic
and
unfeeling
if
we
let
him
know
the
state
of
our
world
we
should
see
the
rosehues
fade
from
his
and
our
friend
put
off
his
singing
robes
and
sit
down
with
us
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
to
share
our
temptation
and
grief
you
see
i
can
not
offer
you
to
him
now
adela
said
her
father
no
papa
but
i
knew
that
all
had
come
right
although
i
saw
from
adela
manner
that
she
was
not
happy
about
it
so
things
went
on
for
a
week
during
which
the
colonel
was
slowly
mending
i
used
to
read
him
to
sleep
adela
would
sit
by
the
fire
or
by
the
bedside
and
go
and
come
while
i
was
reading
one
afternoon
in
the
twilight
harry
entered
we
greeted
and
then
turning
to
the
bed
i
discovered
that
my
friend
was
asleep
we
drew
towards
the
fire
and
sat
down
adela
had
gone
out
of
the
room
a
few
minutes
before
he
is
such
a
manageable
patient
i
said
noble
old
fellow
returned
the
doctor
i
wish
he
would
like
me
and
then
all
would
be
well
he
does
dislike
you
personally
i
said
i
hope
not
i
can
understand
his
displeasure
perfectly
and
repugnance
too
but
i
assure
you
smith
i
did
not
lay
myself
out
to
gain
her
affections
i
was
caught
myself
before
i
knew
and
i
believe
she
liked
me
too
before
she
knew
i
fear
their
means
will
be
very
limited
after
this
for
his
sake
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
but
for
my
own
i
can
not
help
thinking
it
the
luckiest
thing
that
could
have
happened
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
it
might
increase
the
difficulty
at
this
moment
i
thought
i
heard
the
handle
of
the
door
move
but
there
was
a
screen
between
us
and
it
i
went
on
that
is
if
you
still
want
to
marry
her
you
know
marry
her
he
said
if
she
were
a
i
would
be
proud
as
king
cophetua
to
marry
her
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
twilight
and
a
motion
of
its
gloom
with
a
quick
gliding
adela
drew
near
knelt
beside
harry
and
hid
her
eyes
on
his
knee
i
thought
it
better
to
go
was
this
unmaidenly
of
her
i
say
no
for
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
as
i
left
the
room
i
heard
the
colonel
call
adela
and
when
i
returned
i
found
them
both
standing
by
the
bedside
and
the
old
man
holding
a
hand
of
each
now
john
smith
i
said
to
myself
you
may
go
when
you
please
before
we
that
is
i
and
my
reader
part
however
my
reader
may
be
inclined
to
address
me
thus
pray
smith
do
you
think
it
was
your
wonderful
prescription
of
that
wrought
miss
cathcart
cure
how
can
i
tell
i
answer
probably
it
had
its
share
but
there
were
other
things
to
take
into
the
account
if
you
went
on
to
ask
me
whether
it
was
not
harry
prescriptions
or
whether
it
was
not
the
sermons
or
whether
it
was
not
her
falling
in
love
with
the
doctor
or
whether
even
her
father
illness
and
the
loss
of
their
property
had
not
something
to
do
with
it
or
whether
it
was
not
the
doctor
falling
in
love
with
her
or
that
the
cold
weather
suited
her
i
should
reply
in
the
same
way
to
every
one
of
the
interrogatories
but
i
retort
another
question
did
you
ever
know
anything
whatever
resulting
from
the
operation
of
one
separable
cause
in
regard
to
any
good
attempt
i
have
ever
made
in
my
life
i
am
content
to
know
that
the
end
has
been
gained
whether
have
succeeded
or
not
is
of
no
consequence
if
i
have
tried
in
the
present
case
adela
recovered
and
my
own
conviction
is
that
the
cure
was
effected
mainly
from
within
except
in
physics
we
can
put
nothing
to
the
and
must
be
content
with
conjecture
and
probability
the
night
before
i
left
i
had
a
strange
dream
i
stood
in
a
lonely
cemetery
in
a
dark
trees
that
never
shed
their
foliage
rose
all
around
strange
trees
that
mourn
for
ever
because
they
never
die
the
dream
light
that
has
no
visible
source
because
it
is
in
the
soul
that
dreams
showed
all
in
a
dim
dawn
that
never
grew
clearer
the
night
wind
was
the
only
power
abroad
save
myself
it
went
with
slow
intermitting
gusts
through
the
tops
of
the
dreaming
trees
for
the
trees
seemed
in
the
midst
of
my
dream
to
have
dreams
of
their
own
now
this
was
mine
i
had
tended
it
for
years
in
it
lay
all
the
men
and
women
whom
i
had
honoured
and
loved
and
i
was
a
great
sculptor
and
over
every
grave
i
had
placed
a
marble
altar
and
upon
every
altar
the
marble
bust
of
the
man
or
woman
who
lay
beneath
each
in
the
supreme
beauty
which
all
the
defects
of
birth
and
of
time
and
of
incompleteness
could
not
hide
from
the
eye
of
the
prophetic
sculptor
each
was
like
a
glorified
form
of
the
being
who
had
there
descended
into
the
realms
of
hades
and
through
these
glimmering
rows
of
the
dead
i
walked
in
the
and
from
one
to
another
i
went
in
the
glory
of
having
known
and
loved
them
now
weeping
sad
tears
over
the
loss
of
the
beautiful
now
rejoicing
in
the
strength
of
the
mighty
now
exulting
in
the
love
and
truth
which
would
yet
dawn
upon
me
when
i
too
should
go
down
beneath
the
visible
and
emerge
in
the
realms
of
the
actual
and
the
unseen
all
the
time
i
was
sensible
of
a
wondrous
elevation
of
being
a
glory
of
life
and
feeling
hitherto
unknown
to
me
i
had
entered
the
secret
places
of
my
own
hidden
world
by
the
gate
of
sleep
and
walked
about
them
in
my
dream
gradually
i
became
aware
that
a
foreign
sound
was
mingling
with
the
sighing
of
the
overhead
it
grew
and
grew
till
i
recognized
the
sound
of
wheels
not
of
heavenly
chariots
but
of
earthly
motion
and
business
i
heard
them
stop
at
the
lofty
gates
of
my
holy
place
and
by
twoes
and
threes
or
in
solitary
singleness
came
people
into
my
garden
of
the
dead
and
who
should
they
be
but
the
buried
ones
all
those
whose
marble
busts
stood
in
ghostly
silence
within
the
shadows
of
the
everlasting
pines
and
they
talked
and
laughed
and
jested
and
my
city
of
the
dead
melted
away
and
lo
we
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
great
and
i
knew
it
to
be
the
in
which
the
children
had
sat
who
said
to
the
other
children
we
have
piped
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
danced
we
have
mourned
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
lamented
and
to
my
misery
i
saw
that
the
faces
of
my
fathers
and
brothers
my
mothers
and
sisters
had
not
grown
nobler
in
the
country
of
the
dead
in
which
i
had
thought
them
safe
and
shining
cares
as
of
this
world
had
so
settled
upon
them
that
i
could
hardly
recognize
the
old
likeness
and
the
dim
forms
of
the
ideal
glory
which
i
had
reproduced
in
my
marble
busts
had
vanished
altogether
ah
me
my
world
of
the
dead
my
city
of
treasures
hid
away
under
the
locks
and
bars
of
the
unchangeable
was
there
then
no
world
of
realities
only
a
vanity
fair
after
all
the
glorious
women
went
sweeping
about
smiling
and
talking
and
buying
and
adorning
but
they
were
glorious
no
longer
for
they
had
common
thoughts
and
common
beauties
and
common
language
and
aims
and
hopes
and
everything
was
common
about
them
and
ever
and
anon
with
a
kind
of
shiver
as
if
to
keep
alive
my
misery
by
the
sight
of
my
own
dreams
the
marble
busts
would
glimmer
out
faintly
visible
amidst
the
fair
as
if
about
to
reappear
and
dispossessing
the
vacuity
of
folly
assert
the
noble
and
the
true
and
give
me
back
my
dead
to
love
and
worship
once
more
in
the
loneliness
of
the
side
by
side
with
a
greedy
human
face
would
shimmer
out
for
a
moment
the
ghostly
marble
face
and
the
contrast
all
but
drove
me
mad
with
perplexity
and
misery
alas
i
cried
where
is
my
future
where
is
my
beautiful
death
all
at
once
i
saw
the
face
of
a
man
who
went
round
and
round
the
skirts
of
the
market
and
looked
earnestly
in
amongst
the
busy
idlers
he
was
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
any
there
and
his
face
was
a
pale
face
with
an
infinite
future
in
it
visible
in
all
its
grief
i
made
my
way
through
the
crowd
which
regarded
me
with
a
look
which
i
could
not
understand
and
came
to
the
stranger
i
threw
myself
at
his
feet
and
sobbed
i
have
lost
them
all
i
will
follow
thee
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
back
we
walked
up
and
down
the
fair
together
and
as
we
walked
the
tumult
lessened
and
lessened
they
made
a
path
for
us
to
go
and
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
my
guide
the
tumult
sank
and
all
was
still
men
and
women
stood
in
silent
rows
my
guide
looked
upon
them
all
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
and
they
all
looked
on
him
till
their
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
the
old
faces
of
my
friends
grew
slowly
out
of
the
worldly
faces
until
at
length
they
were
such
as
i
had
known
of
yore
suddenly
they
all
fell
upon
their
knees
and
their
faces
changed
into
the
likeness
of
my
marble
faces
then
my
guide
waved
his
hand
and
lo
we
were
in
the
midst
of
my
garden
of
the
dead
and
the
wind
was
like
the
sound
of
a
going
in
the
tops
of
the
pine
trees
and
my
white
marbles
glimmered
glorified
on
the
altars
of
the
tombs
and
the
dream
vanished
and
i
came
awake
and
i
will
not
say
here
whose
face
the
face
of
my
guide
was
like
the
end
