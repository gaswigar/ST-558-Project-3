etc
the
value
of
yogananda
autobiographyis
greatly
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
few
books
in
english
about
the
wise
men
of
india
which
has
been
written
not
by
a
journalist
or
foreigner
but
by
one
of
their
own
race
and
training
in
short
a
book
about
yogis
by
a
yogi
as
an
eyewitness
recountal
of
the
extraordinary
lives
and
powers
of
modern
hindu
saints
the
book
has
importance
both
timely
and
timeless
to
its
illustrious
author
whom
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
both
in
india
and
america
may
every
reader
render
due
appreciation
and
gratitude
his
unusual
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
revealing
of
the
depths
of
the
hindu
mind
and
heart
and
of
the
spiritual
wealth
of
india
ever
to
be
published
in
the
west
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
have
met
one
of
the
sages
whose
is
herein
yukteswar
giri
a
likeness
of
the
venerable
saint
appeared
as
part
of
the
frontispiece
of
my
tibetan
yoga
and
secret
doctrines
it
was
at
puri
in
orissa
on
the
bay
of
bengal
that
i
encountered
sri
yukteswar
he
was
then
the
head
of
a
quiet
ashrama
near
the
seashore
there
and
was
chiefly
occupied
in
the
spiritual
training
of
a
group
of
youthful
disciples
he
expressed
keen
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
of
all
the
americas
and
of
england
too
and
questioned
me
concerning
the
distant
activities
particularly
those
in
california
of
his
chief
disciple
paramhansa
yogananda
whom
he
dearly
loved
and
whom
he
had
sent
in
as
his
emissary
to
the
west
sri
yukteswar
was
of
gentle
mien
and
voice
of
pleasing
presence
and
worthy
of
the
veneration
which
his
followers
spontaneously
accorded
to
him
every
person
who
knew
him
whether
of
his
own
community
or
not
held
him
in
the
highest
esteem
i
vividly
recall
his
tall
straight
ascetic
figure
garbed
in
the
garb
of
one
who
has
renounced
worldly
quests
as
he
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
hermitage
to
give
me
welcome
his
hair
was
long
and
somewhat
curly
and
his
face
bearded
his
body
was
muscularly
firm
but
slender
and
and
his
step
energetic
he
had
chosen
as
his
place
of
earthly
abode
the
holy
city
of
puri
whither
multitudes
of
pious
hindus
representative
of
every
province
of
india
come
daily
on
pilgrimage
to
the
famed
temple
of
jagannath
lord
of
the
world
it
was
at
puri
that
sri
yukteswar
closed
his
mortal
eyes
in
to
the
scenes
of
this
transitory
state
of
being
and
passed
on
knowing
that
his
incarnation
had
been
carried
to
a
triumphant
completion
i
am
glad
indeed
to
be
able
to
record
this
testimony
to
the
high
character
and
holiness
of
sri
yukteswar
content
to
remain
afar
from
the
multitude
he
gave
himself
unreservedly
and
in
tranquillity
to
that
ideal
life
which
paramhansa
yogananda
his
disciple
has
now
described
for
the
ages

chapter
my
parents
and
early
life
the
characteristic
features
of
indian
culture
have
long
been
a
search
for
ultimate
verities
and
the
concomitant
relationship
my
own
path
led
me
to
a
christlike
sage
whose
beautiful
life
was
chiseled
for
the
ages
he
was
one
of
the
great
masters
who
are
india
sole
remaining
wealth
emerging
in
every
generation
they
have
bulwarked
their
land
against
the
fate
of
babylon
and
egypt
i
find
my
earliest
memories
covering
the
anachronistic
features
of
a
previous
incarnation
clear
recollections
came
to
me
of
a
distant
life
a
yogi
amidst
the
himalayan
snows
these
glimpses
of
the
past
by
some
dimensionless
link
also
afforded
me
a
glimpse
of
the
future
the
helpless
humiliations
of
infancy
are
not
banished
from
my
mind
i
was
resentfully
conscious
of
not
being
able
to
walk
or
express
myself
freely
prayerful
surges
arose
within
me
as
i
realized
my
bodily
impotence
my
strong
emotional
life
took
silent
form
as
words
in
many
languages
among
the
inward
confusion
of
tongues
my
ear
gradually
accustomed
itself
to
the
circumambient
bengali
syllables
of
my
people
the
beguiling
scope
of
an
infant
mind
adultly
considered
limited
to
toys
and
toes
psychological
ferment
and
my
unresponsive
body
brought
me
to
many
obstinate
i
recall
the
general
family
bewilderment
at
my
distress
happier
memories
too
crowd
in
on
me
my
caresses
and
my
first
attempts
at
lisping
phrase
and
toddling
step
these
early
triumphs
usually
forgotten
quickly
are
yet
a
natural
basis
of
my
memories
are
not
unique
many
yogis
are
known
to
have
retained
their
without
interruption
by
the
dramatic
transition
to
and
from
life
and
death
if
man
be
solely
a
body
its
loss
indeed
places
the
final
period
to
identity
but
if
prophets
down
the
millenniums
spake
with
truth
man
is
essentially
of
incorporeal
nature
the
persistent
core
of
human
egoity
is
only
temporarily
allied
with
sense
perception
although
odd
clear
memories
of
infancy
are
not
extremely
rare
during
travels
in
numerous
lands
i
have
listened
to
early
recollections
from
the
lips
of
veracious
men
and
women
i
was
born
in
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
passed
my
first
eight
years
at
gorakhpur
this
was
my
birthplace
in
the
united
provinces
of
northeastern
india
we
were
eight
children
four
boys
and
four
girls
i
mukunda
lal
ghosh
was
the
second
son
and
the
fourth
child
father
and
mother
were
bengalis
of
the
kshatriya
caste
both
were
blessed
with
saintly
nature
their
mutual
love
tranquil
and
dignified
never
expressed
itself
frivolously
a
perfect
parental
harmony
was
the
calm
center
for
the
revolving
tumult
of
eight
young
lives
father
bhagabati
charan
ghosh
was
kind
grave
at
times
stern
loving
him
dearly
we
children
yet
observed
a
certain
reverential
distance
an
outstanding
mathematician
and
logician
he
was
guided
principally
by
his
intellect
but
mother
was
a
queen
of
hearts
and
taught
us
only
through
love
after
her
death
father
displayed
more
of
his
inner
tenderness
i
noticed
then
that
his
gaze
often
metamorphosed
into
my
mother
in
mother
presence
we
tasted
our
earliest
acquaintance
with
the
scriptures
tales
from
the
mahabharata
and
ramayana
were
resourcefully
summoned
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
discipline
instruction
and
chastisement
went
hand
in
hand
a
daily
gesture
of
respect
to
father
was
given
by
mother
dressing
us
carefully
in
the
afternoons
to
welcome
him
home
from
the
office
his
position
was
similar
to
that
of
a
in
the
railway
one
of
india
large
companies
his
work
involved
traveling
and
our
family
lived
in
several
cities
during
my
childhood
mother
held
an
open
hand
toward
the
needy
father
was
also
kindly
disposed
but
his
respect
for
law
and
order
extended
to
the
budget
one
fortnight
mother
spent
in
feeding
the
poor
more
than
monthly
income
all
i
ask
please
is
to
keep
your
charities
within
a
reasonable
limit
even
a
gentle
rebuke
from
her
husband
was
grievous
to
mother
she
ordered
a
hackney
carriage
not
hinting
to
the
children
at
any
disagreement
i
am
going
away
to
my
mother
home
ancient
ultimatum
we
broke
into
astounded
lamentations
our
maternal
uncle
arrived
opportunely
he
whispered
to
father
some
sage
counsel
garnered
no
doubt
from
the
ages
after
father
had
made
a
few
conciliatory
remarks
mother
happily
dismissed
the
cab
thus
ended
the
only
trouble
i
ever
noticed
between
my
parents
but
i
recall
a
characteristic
discussion
please
give
me
ten
rupees
for
a
hapless
woman
who
has
just
arrived
at
the
house
mother
smile
had
its
own
persuasion
why
ten
rupees
one
is
enough
father
added
a
justification
when
my
father
and
grandparents
died
suddenly
i
had
my
first
taste
of
poverty
my
only
breakfast
before
walking
miles
to
my
school
was
a
small
banana
later
at
the
university
i
was
in
such
need
that
i
applied
to
a
wealthy
judge
for
aid
of
one
rupee
per
month
he
declined
remarking
that
even
a
rupee
is
important
how
bitterly
you
recall
the
denial
of
that
rupee
mother
heart
had
an
instant
logic
do
you
want
this
woman
also
to
remember
painfully
your
refusal
of
ten
rupees
which
she
needs
urgently
you
win
with
the
immemorial
gesture
of
vanquished
husbands
he
opened
his
wallet
here
is
a
note
give
it
to
her
with
my
good
will
father
tended
to
first
say
no
to
any
new
proposal
his
attitude
toward
the
strange
woman
who
so
readily
enlisted
mother
sympathy
was
an
example
of
his
customary
caution
aversion
to
instant
acceptance
typical
of
the
french
mind
in
the
really
only
honoring
the
principle
of
due
reflection
i
always
found
father
reasonable
and
evenly
balanced
in
his
judgments
if
i
could
bolster
up
my
numerous
requests
with
one
or
two
good
arguments
he
invariably
put
the
coveted
goal
within
my
reach
whether
it
were
a
vacation
trip
or
a
new
motorcycle
father
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
to
his
children
in
their
early
years
but
his
attitude
toward
himself
was
truly
spartan
he
never
visited
the
theater
for
instance
but
sought
his
recreation
in
various
spiritual
practices
and
in
reading
the
bhagavad
gita
shunning
all
luxuries
he
would
cling
to
one
old
pair
of
shoes
until
they
were
useless
his
sons
bought
automobiles
after
they
came
into
popular
use
but
father
was
always
content
with
the
trolley
car
for
his
daily
ride
to
the
office
the
accumulation
of
money
for
the
sake
of
power
was
alien
to
his
nature
once
after
organizing
the
calcutta
urban
bank
he
refused
to
benefit
himself
by
holding
any
of
its
shares
he
had
simply
wished
to
perform
a
civic
duty
in
his
spare
time
several
years
after
father
had
retired
on
a
pension
an
english
accountant
arrived
to
examine
the
books
of
the
railway
company
the
amazed
investigator
discovered
that
father
had
never
applied
for
overdue
bonuses
he
did
the
work
of
three
men
the
accountant
told
the
company
he
has
rupees
about
owing
to
him
as
back
compensation
the
officials
presented
father
with
a
check
for
this
amount
he
thought
so
little
about
it
that
he
overlooked
any
mention
to
the
family
much
later
he
was
questioned
by
my
youngest
brother
bishnu
who
noticed
the
large
deposit
on
a
bank
statement
why
be
elated
by
material
profit
father
replied
the
one
who
pursues
a
goal
of
evenmindedness
is
neither
jubilant
with
gain
nor
depressed
by
loss
he
knows
that
man
arrives
penniless
in
this
world
and
departs
without
a
single
rupee

my
father
bhagabati

disciple

see
early
in
their
married
life
my
parents
became
disciples
of
a
great
master
lahiri
mahasaya

benares
this
contact
strengthened
father
naturally
ascetical
temperament
mother
made
a
remarkable
admission
to
my
eldest
sister

your
father
and
myself
live
together
as
man
and
wife
only
once
a
year
for
the
purpose

first
met
lahiri
mahasaya
through
abinash
babu
an
employee
in
the
gorakhpur
office
of
the
railway
abinash
instructed
my
young
ears
with
engrossing
tales
of
many
indian
saints
he
invariably
concluded
with
a
tribute
to
the
superior
glories
of
his
own
guru
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances
under
which
your
father
became
a
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
it
was
on
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
as
abinash
and
i
sat
together
in
the
compound
of
my
home
that
he
put
this
intriguing
question
i
shook
my
head
with
a
smile
of
anticipation
years
ago
before
you
were
born
i
asked
my
superior
give
me
a
week
leave
from
my
gorakhpur
duties
in
order
to
visit
my
guru
in
benares
your
father
ridiculed
my
plan
you
going
to
become
a
religious
fanatic
he
inquired
on
your
office
work
if
you
want
to
forge
ahead
sadly
walking
home
along
a
woodland
path
that
day
i
met
your
father
in
a
palanquin
he
dismissed
his
servants
and
conveyance
and
fell
into
step
beside
me
seeking
to
console
me
he
pointed
out
the
advantages
of
striving
for
worldly
success
but
i
heard
him
listlessly
my
heart
was
repeating
mahasaya
i
can
not
live
without
seeing
you
our
path
took
us
to
the
edge
of
a
tranquil
field
where
the
rays
of
the
late
afternoon
sun
were
still
crowning
the
tall
ripple
of
the
wild
grass
we
paused
in
admiration
there
in
the
field
only
a
few
yards
from
us
the
form
of
my
great
guru
suddenly
appeared
you
are
too
hard
on
your
employee
his
voice
was
resonant
in
our
astounded
ears
he
vanished
as
mysteriously
as
he
had
come
on
my
knees
i
was
exclaiming
mahasaya
lahiri
mahasaya
your
father
was
motionless
with
stupefaction
for
a
few
moments
not
only
do
i
give
you
leave
but
i
give
myself
leave
to
start
for
benares
tomorrow
i
must
know
this
great
lahiri
mahasaya
who
is
able
to
materialize
himself
at
will
in
order
to
intercede
for
you
i
will
take
my
wife
and
ask
this
master
to
initiate
us
in
his
spiritual
path
will
you
guide
us
to
him
course
joy
filled
me
at
the
miraculous
answer
to
my
prayer
and
the
quick
favorable
turn
of
events
the
next
evening
your
parents
and
i
entrained
for
benares
we
took
a
horse
cart
the
following
day
and
then
had
to
walk
through
narrow
lanes
to
my
guru
secluded
home
entering
his
little
parlor
we
bowed
before
the
master
enlocked
in
his
habitual
lotus
posture
he
blinked
his
piercing
eyes
and
leveled
them
on
your
father
you
are
too
hard
on
your
employee
his
words
were
the
same
as
those
he
had
used
two
days
before
in
the
gorakhpur
field
he
added
am
glad
that
you
have
allowed
abinash
to
visit
me
and
that
you
and
your
wife
have
accompanied
him
to
their
joy
he
initiated
your
parents
in
the
spiritual
practice
of
kriya
yoga
your
father
and
i
as
brother
disciples
have
been
close
friends
since
the
memorable
day
of
the
vision
lahiri
mahasaya
took
a
definite
interest
in
your
own
birth
your
life
shall
surely
be
linked
with
his
own
the
master
blessing
never
fails
lahiri
mahasaya
left
this
world
shortly
after
i
had
entered
it
his
picture
in
an
ornate
frame
always
graced
our
family
altar
in
the
various
cities
to
which
father
was
transferred
by
his
office
many
a
morning
and
evening
found
mother
and
me
meditating
before
an
improvised
shrine
offering
flowers
dipped
in
fragrant
sandalwood
paste
with
frankincense
and
myrrh
as
well
as
our
united
devotions
we
honored
the
divinity
which
had
found
full
expression
in
lahiri
mahasaya
his
picture
had
a
surpassing
influence
over
my
life
as
i
grew
the
thought
of
the
master
grew
with
me
in
meditation
i
would
often
see
his
photographic
image
emerge
from
its
small
frame
and
taking
a
living
form
sit
before
me
when
i
attempted
to
touch
the
feet
of
his
luminous
body
it
would
change
and
again
become
the
picture
as
childhood
slipped
into
boyhood
i
found
lahiri
mahasaya
transformed
in
my
mind
from
a
little
image
cribbed
in
a
frame
to
a
living
enlightening
presence
i
frequently
prayed
to
him
in
moments
of
trial
or
confusion
finding
within
me
his
solacing
direction
at
first
i
grieved
because
he
was
no
longer
physically
living
as
i
began
to
discover
his
secret
omnipresence
i
lamented
no
more
he
had
often
written
to
those
of
his
disciples
who
were
to
see
him
why
come
to
view
my
bones
and
flesh
when
i
am
ever
within
range
of
your
kutastha
spiritual
sight
i
was
blessed
about
the
age
of
eight
with
a
wonderful
healing
through
the
photograph
of
lahiri
mahasaya
this
experience
gave
intensification
to
my
love
while
at
our
family
estate
in
ichapur
bengal
i
was
stricken
with
asiatic
cholera
my
life
was
despaired
of
the
doctors
could
do
nothing
at
my
bedside
mother
frantically
motioned
me
to
look
at
lahiri
mahasaya
picture
on
the
wall
above
my
head
bow
to
him
mentally
she
knew
i
was
too
feeble
even
to
lift
my
hands
in
salutation
if
you
really
show
your
devotion
and
inwardly
kneel
before
him
your
life
will
be
spared
i
gazed
at
his
photograph
and
saw
there
a
blinding
light
enveloping
my
body
and
the
entire
room
my
nausea
and
other
uncontrollable
symptoms
disappeared
i
was
well
at
once
i
felt
strong
enough
to
bend
over
and
touch
mother
feet
in
appreciation
of
her
immeasurable
faith
in
her
guru
mother
pressed
her
head
repeatedly
against
the
little
picture
o
omnipresent
master
i
thank
thee
that
thy
light
hath
healed
my
son
i
realized
that
she
too
had
witnessed
the
luminous
blaze
through
which
i
had
instantly
recovered
from
a
usually
fatal
disease
one
of
my
most
precious
possessions
is
that
same
photograph
given
to
father
by
lahiri
mahasaya
himself
it
carries
a
holy
vibration
the
picture
had
a
miraculous
origin
i
heard
the
story
from
brother
disciple
kali
kumar
roy
it
appears
that
the
master
had
an
aversion
to
being
photographed
over
his
protest
a
group
picture
was
once
taken
of
him
and
a
cluster
of
devotees
including
kali
kumar
roy
it
was
an
amazed
photographer
who
discovered
that
the
plate
which
had
clear
images
of
all
the
disciples
revealed
nothing
more
than
a
blank
space
in
the
center
where
he
had
reasonably
expected
to
find
the
outlines
of
lahiri
mahasaya
the
phenomenon
was
widely
discussed
a
certain
student
and
expert
photographer
ganga
dhar
babu
boasted
that
the
fugitive
figure
would
not
escape
him
the
next
morning
as
the
guru
sat
in
lotus
posture
on
a
wooden
bench
with
a
screen
behind
him
ganga
dhar
babu
arrived
with
his
equipment
taking
every
precaution
for
success
he
greedily
exposed
twelve
plates
on
each
one
he
soon
found
the
imprint
of
the
wooden
bench
and
screen
but
once
again
the
master
form
was
missing
with
tears
and
shattered
pride
ganga
dhar
babu
sought
out
his
guru
it
was
many
hours
before
lahiri
mahasaya
broke
his
silence
with
a
pregnant
comment
i
am
spirit
can
your
camera
reflect
the
omnipresent
invisible
i
see
it
can
not
but
holy
sir
i
lovingly
desire
a
picture
of
the
bodily
temple
where
alone
to
my
narrow
vision
that
spirit
appears
fully
to
dwell
come
then
tomorrow
morning
i
will
pose
for
you
again
the
photographer
focused
his
camera
this
time
the
sacred
figure
not
cloaked
with
mysterious
imperceptibility
was
sharp
on
the
plate
the
master
never
posed
for
another
picture
at
least
i
have
seen
none
the
photograph
is
reproduced
in
this
book
lahiri
mahasaya
fair
features
of
a
universal
cast
hardly
suggest
to
what
race
he
belonged
his
intense
joy
of
is
slightly
revealed
in
a
somewhat
enigmatic
smile
his
eyes
half
open
to
denote
a
nominal
direction
on
the
outer
world
are
half
closed
also
completely
oblivious
to
the
poor
lures
of
the
earth
he
was
fully
awake
at
all
times
to
the
spiritual
problems
of
seekers
who
approached
for
his
bounty
shortly
after
my
healing
through
the
potency
of
the
guru
picture
i
had
an
influential
spiritual
vision
sitting
on
my
bed
one
morning
i
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
what
is
behind
the
darkness
of
closed
eyes
this
probing
thought
came
powerfully
into
my
mind
an
immense
flash
of
light
at
once
manifested
to
my
inward
gaze
divine
shapes
of
saints
sitting
in
meditation
posture
in
mountain
caves
formed
like
miniature
cinema
pictures
on
the
large
screen
of
radiance
within
my
forehead
who
are
you
i
spoke
aloud
we
are
the
himalayan
yogis
the
celestial
response
is
difficult
to
describe
my
heart
was
thrilled
ah
i
long
to
go
to
the
himalayas
and
become
like
you
the
vision
vanished
but
the
silvery
beams
expanded
in
circles
to
infinity
what
is
this
wondrous
glow
i
am
iswara
i
am
light
the
voice
was
as
murmuring
clouds
i
want
to
be
one
with
thee
out
of
the
slow
dwindling
of
my
divine
ecstasy
i
salvaged
a
permanent
legacy
of
inspiration
to
seek
god
he
is
eternal
joy
this
memory
persisted
long
after
the
day
of
rapture
another
early
recollection
is
outstanding
and
literally
so
for
i
bear
the
scar
to
this
day
my
elder
sister
uma
and
i
were
seated
in
the
early
morning
under
a
neem
tree
in
our
gorakhpur
compound
she
was
helping
me
with
a
bengali
primer
what
time
i
could
spare
my
gaze
from
the
parrots
eating
ripe
margosa
fruit
uma
complained
of
a
boil
on
her
leg
and
fetched
a
jar
of
ointment
i
smeared
a
bit
of
the
salve
on
my
forearm
why
do
you
use
medicine
on
a
healthy
arm
well
sis
i
feel
i
am
going
to
have
a
boil
tomorrow
i
am
testing
your
ointment
on
the
spot
where
the
boil
will
appear
you
little
liar
sis
do
call
me
a
liar
until
you
see
what
happens
in
the
morning
indignation
filled
me
uma
was
unimpressed
and
thrice
repeated
her
taunt
an
adamant
resolution
sounded
in
my
voice
as
i
made
slow
reply
by
the
power
of
will
in
me
i
say
that
tomorrow
i
shall
have
a
fairly
large
boil
in
this
exact
place
on
my
arm
and
your
boil
shall
swell
to
twice
its
present
size
morning
found
me
with
a
stalwart
boil
on
the
indicated
spot
the
dimensions
of
uma
boil
had
doubled
with
a
shriek
my
sister
rushed
to
mother
mukunda
has
become
a
necromancer
gravely
mother
instructed
me
never
to
use
the
power
of
words
for
doing
harm
i
have
always
remembered
her
counsel
and
followed
it
my
boil
was
surgically
treated
a
noticeable
scar
left
by
the
doctor
incision
is
present
today
on
my
right
forearm
is
a
constant
reminder
of
the
power
in
man
sheer
word
those
simple
and
apparently
harmless
phrases
to
uma
spoken
with
deep
concentration
had
possessed
sufficient
hidden
force
to
explode
like
bombs
and
produce
definite
though
injurious
effects
i
understood
later
that
the
explosive
vibratory
power
in
speech
could
be
wisely
directed
to
free
one
life
from
difficulties
and
thus
operate
without
scar
or
rebuke
our
family
moved
to
lahore
in
the
punjab
there
i
acquired
a
picture
of
the
divine
mother
in
the
form
of
the
goddess
kali
it
sanctified
a
small
informal
shrine
on
the
balcony
of
our
home
an
unequivocal
conviction
came
over
me
that
fulfillment
would
crown
any
of
my
prayers
uttered
in
that
sacred
spot
standing
there
with
uma
one
day
i
watched
two
kites
flying
over
the
roofs
of
the
buildings
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
very
narrow
lane
why
are
you
so
quiet
uma
pushed
me
playfully
i
am
just
thinking
how
wonderful
it
is
that
divine
mother
gives
me
whatever
i
ask
i
suppose
she
would
give
you
those
two
kites
my
sister
laughed
derisively
why
not
i
began
silent
prayers
for
their
possession
matches
are
played
in
india
with
kites
whose
strings
are
covered
with
glue
and
ground
glass
each
player
attempts
to
sever
the
string
of
his
opponent
a
freed
kite
sails
over
the
roofs
there
is
great
fun
in
catching
it
inasmuch
as
uma
and
i
were
on
the
balcony
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
loosed
kite
could
come
into
our
hands
its
string
would
naturally
dangle
over
the
roofs
the
players
across
the
lane
began
their
match
one
string
was
cut
immediately
the
kite
floated
in
my
direction
it
was
stationary
for
a
moment
through
sudden
abatement
of
breeze
which
sufficed
to
firmly
entangle
the
string
with
a
cactus
plant
on
top
of
the
opposite
house
a
perfect
loop
was
formed
for
my
seizure
i
handed
the
prize
to
uma
it
was
just
an
extraordinary
accident
and
not
an
answer
to
your
prayer
if
the
other
kite
comes
to
you
then
i
shall
believe
sister
dark
eyes
conveyed
more
amazement
than
her
words
i
continued
my
prayers
with
a
crescendo
intensity
a
forcible
tug
by
the
other
player
resulted
in
the
abrupt
loss
of
his
kite
it
headed
toward
me
dancing
in
the
wind
my
helpful
assistant
the
cactus
plant
again
secured
the
kite
string
in
the
necessary
loop
by
which
i
could
grasp
it
i
presented
my
second
trophy
to
uma
indeed
divine
mother
listens
to
you
this
is
all
too
uncanny

myself
silently

all
at

it
were
out
of
the
intensity
of
the
consciousness

individuality
individuality
itself
seemed
to
dissolve

state

of
the

utterly
beyond
death
was
an
almost
laughable
loss
of
personality
if
so
it
were
seeming
no
extinction

the
only
true
life

plans
were
truly
elaborate
mother
was
welcoming
numerous
relatives
daily
arriving
in
calcutta
from
distant
homes
she
lodged
them
comfortably
in
a
large
newly
acquired
house
at
amherst
street
everything
was
in
banquet
delicacies
the
gay
throne
on
which
brother
was
to
be
carried
to
the
home
of
the
the
rows
of
colorful
lights
the
mammoth
cardboard
elephants
and
camels
the
english
scottish
and
indian
orchestras
the
professional
entertainers
the
priests
for
the
ancient
rituals
father
and
i
in
gala
spirits
were
planning
to
join
the
family
in
time
for
the
ceremony
shortly
before
the
great
day
however
i
had
an
ominous
vision
it
was
in
bareilly
on
a
midnight
as
i
slept
beside
father
on
the
piazza
of
our
bungalow
i
was
awakened
by
a
peculiar
flutter
of
the
mosquito
netting
over
the
bed
the
flimsy
curtains
parted
and
i
saw
the
beloved
form
of
my
mother
awaken
your
father
her
voice
was
only
a
whisper
take
the
first
available
train
at
four
this
morning
rush
to
calcutta
if
you
would
see
me
the
wraithlike
figure
vanished
father
father
mother
is
dying
the
terror
in
my
tone
aroused
him
instantly
i
sobbed
out
the
fatal
tidings
never
mind
that
hallucination
of
yours
father
gave
his
characteristic
negation
to
a
new
situation
your
mother
is
in
excellent
health
if
we
get
any
bad
news
we
shall
leave
tomorrow
you
shall
never
forgive
yourself
for
not
starting
now
anguish
caused
me
to
add
bitterly
nor
shall
i
ever
forgive
you
the
melancholy
morning
came
with
explicit
words
mother
dangerously
ill
marriage
postponed
come
at
once
father
and
i
left
distractedly
one
of
my
uncles
met
us
en
route
at
a
transfer
point
a
train
thundered
toward
us
looming
with
telescopic
increase
from
my
inner
tumult
an
abrupt
determination
arose
to
hurl
myself
on
the
railroad
tracks
already
bereft
i
felt
of
my
mother
i
could
not
endure
a
world
suddenly
barren
to
the
bone
i
loved
mother
as
my
dearest
friend
on
earth
her
solacing
black
eyes
had
been
my
surest
refuge
in
the
trifling
tragedies
of
childhood
does
she
yet
live
i
stopped
for
one
last
question
to
my
uncle
of
course
she
is
alive
he
was
not
slow
to
interpret
the
desperation
in
my
face
but
i
scarcely
believed
him
when
we
reached
our
calcutta
home
it
was
only
to
confront
the
stunning
mystery
of
death
i
collapsed
into
an
almost
lifeless
state
years
passed
before
any
reconciliation
entered
my
heart
storming
the
very
gates
of
heaven
my
cries
at
last
summoned
the
divine
mother
her
words
brought
final
healing
to
my
suppurating
wounds
it
is
i
who
have
watched
over
thee
life
after
life
in
the
tenderness
of
many
mothers
see
in
my
gaze
the
two
black
eyes
the
lost
beautiful
eyes
thou
seekest
father
and
i
returned
to
bareilly
soon
after
the
crematory
rites
for
the
early
every
morning
i
made
a
pathetic
memorial
pilgrimage
to
a
large
sheoli
tree
which
shaded
the
smooth
lawn
before
our
bungalow
in
poetical
moments
i
thought
that
the
white
sheoli
flowers
were
strewing
themselves
with
a
willing
devotion
over
the
grassy
altar
mingling
tears
with
the
dew
i
often
observed
a
strange
light
emerging
from
the
dawn
intense
pangs
of
longing
for
god
assailed
me
i
felt
powerfully
drawn
to
the
himalayas
one
of
my
cousins
fresh
from
a
period
of
travel
in
the
holy
hills
visited
us
in
bareilly
i
listened
eagerly
to
his
tales
about
the
high
mountain
abode
of
yogis
and
swamis
let
us
run
away
to
the
himalayas
my
suggestion
one
day
to
dwarka
prasad
the
young
son
of
our
landlord
in
bareilly
fell
on
unsympathetic
ears
he
revealed
my
plan
to
my
elder
brother
who
had
just
arrived
to
see
father
instead
of
laughing
lightly
over
this
impractical
scheme
of
a
small
boy
ananta
made
it
a
definite
point
to
ridicule
me
where
is
your
orange
robe
you
ca
be
a
swami
without
that
but
i
was
inexplicably
thrilled
by
his
words
they
brought
a
clear
picture
of
myself
roaming
about
india
as
a
monk
perhaps
they
awakened
memories
of
a
past
life
in
any
case
i
began
to
see
with
what
natural
ease
i
would
wear
the
garb
of
that
monastic
order
chatting
one
morning
with
dwarka
i
felt
a
love
for
god
descending
with
avalanchic
force
my
companion
was
only
partly
attentive
to
the
ensuing
eloquence
but
i
was
wholeheartedly
listening
to
myself
i
fled
that
afternoon
toward
naini
tal
in
the
himalayan
foothills
ananta
gave
determined
chase
i
was
forced
to
return
sadly
to
bareilly
the
only
pilgrimage
permitted
me
was
the
customary
one
at
dawn
to
the
sheoli
tree
my
heart
wept
for
the
lost
mothers
human
and
divine
the
rent
left
in
the
family
fabric
by
mother
death
was
irreparable
father
never
remarried
during
his
nearly
forty
remaining
years
assuming
the
difficult
role
of
to
his
little
flock
he
grew
noticeably
more
tender
more
approachable
with
calmness
and
insight
he
solved
the
various
family
problems
after
office
hours
he
retired
like
a
hermit
to
the
cell
of
his
room
practicing
kriya
yoga
in
a
sweet
serenity
long
after
mother
death
i
attempted
to
engage
an
english
nurse
to
attend
to
details
that
would
make
my
parent
life
more
comfortable
but
father
shook
his
head
illustration
my
mother
a
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
see
service
to
me
ended
with
your
mother
his
eyes
were
remote
with
a
lifelong
devotion
i
will
not
accept
ministrations
from
any
other
woman
fourteen
months
after
mother
passing
i
learned
that
she
had
left
me
a
momentous
message
ananta
was
present
at
her
deathbed
and
had
recorded
her
words
although
she
had
asked
that
the
disclosure
be
made
to
me
in
one
year
my
brother
delayed
he
was
soon
to
leave
bareilly
for
calcutta
to
marry
the
girl
mother
had
chosen
for
him
one
evening
he
summoned
me
to
his
side
mukunda
i
have
been
reluctant
to
give
you
strange
tidings
ananta
tone
held
a
note
of
resignation
my
fear
was
to
inflame
your
desire
to
leave
home
but
in
any
case
you
are
bristling
with
divine
ardor
when
i
captured
you
recently
on
your
way
to
the
himalayas
i
came
to
a
definite
resolve
i
must
not
further
postpone
the
fulfillment
of
my
solemn
promise
my
brother
handed
me
a
small
box
and
delivered
mother
message
let
these
words
be
my
final
blessing
my
beloved
son
mukunda
mother
had
said
the
hour
is
here
when
i
must
relate
a
number
of
phenomenal
events
following
your
birth
i
first
knew
your
destined
path
when
you
were
but
a
babe
in
my
arms
i
carried
you
then
to
the
home
of
my
guru
in
benares
almost
hidden
behind
a
throng
of
disciples
i
could
barely
see
lahiri
mahasaya
as
he
sat
in
deep
meditation
while
i
patted
you
i
was
praying
that
the
great
guru
take
notice
and
bestow
a
blessing
as
my
silent
devotional
demand
grew
in
intensity
he
opened
his
eyes
and
beckoned
me
to
approach
the
others
made
a
way
for
me
i
bowed
at
the
sacred
feet
my
master
seated
you
on
his
lap
placing
his
hand
on
your
forehead
by
way
of
spiritually
baptizing
you
mother
thy
son
will
be
a
yogi
as
a
spiritual
engine
he
will
carry
many
souls
to
god
kingdom
my
heart
leaped
with
joy
to
find
my
secret
prayer
granted
by
the
omniscient
guru
shortly
before
your
birth
he
had
told
me
you
would
follow
his
path
later
my
son
your
vision
of
the
great
light
was
known
to
me
and
your
sister
roma
as
from
the
next
room
we
observed
you
motionless
on
the
bed
your
little
face
was
illuminated
your
voice
rang
with
iron
resolve
as
you
spoke
of
going
to
the
himalayas
in
quest
of
the
divine
in
these
ways
dear
son
i
came
to
know
that
your
road
lies
far
from
worldly
ambitions
the
most
singular
event
in
my
life
brought
further
event
which
now
impels
my
deathbed
message
it
was
an
interview
with
a
sage
in
the
punjab
while
our
family
was
living
in
lahore
one
morning
the
servant
came
precipitantly
into
my
room
a
strange
sadhu
is
here
he
insists
that
he
see
the
mother
of
mukunda
these
simple
words
struck
a
profound
chord
within
me
i
went
at
once
to
greet
the
visitor
bowing
at
his
feet
i
sensed
that
before
me
was
a
true
man
of
god
he
said
great
masters
wish
you
to
know
that
your
stay
on
earth
will
not
be
long
your
next
illness
shall
prove
to
be
your
last
there
was
a
silence
during
which
i
felt
no
alarm
but
only
a
vibration
of
great
peace
finally
he
addressed
me
again
are
to
be
the
custodian
of
a
certain
silver
amulet
i
will
not
give
it
to
you
today
to
demonstrate
the
truth
in
my
words
the
talisman
shall
materialize
in
your
hands
tomorrow
as
you
meditate
on
your
deathbed
you
must
instruct
your
eldest
son
ananta
to
keep
the
amulet
for
one
year
and
then
to
hand
it
over
to
your
second
son
mukunda
will
understand
the
meaning
of
the
talisman
from
the
great
ones
he
should
receive
it
about
the
time
he
is
ready
to
renounce
all
worldly
hopes
and
start
his
vital
search
for
god
when
he
has
retained
the
amulet
for
some
years
and
when
it
has
served
its
purpose
it
shall
vanish
even
if
kept
in
the
most
secret
spot
it
shall
return
whence
it
came
i
proffered
alms
to
the
saint
and
bowed
before
him
in
great
reverence
not
taking
the
offering
he
departed
with
a
blessing
the
next
evening
as
i
sat
with
folded
hands
in
meditation
a
silver
amulet
materialized
between
my
palms
even
as
the
sadhu
had
promised
it
made
itself
known
by
a
cold
smooth
touch
i
have
jealously
guarded
it
for
more
than
two
years
and
now
leave
it
in
ananta
keeping
do
not
grieve
for
me
as
i
shall
have
been
ushered
by
my
great
guru
into
the
arms
of
the
infinite
farewell
my
child
the
cosmic
mother
will
protect
you
a
blaze
of
illumination
came
over
me
with
possession
of
the
amulet
many
dormant
memories
awakened
the
talisman
round
and
anciently
quaint
was
covered
with
sanskrit
characters
i
understood
that
it
came
from
teachers
of
past
lives
who
were
invisibly
guiding
my
steps
a
further
significance
there
was
indeed
but
one
does
not
reveal
fully
the
heart
of
an
amulet
how
the
talisman
finally
vanished
amidst
deeply
unhappy
circumstances
of
my
life
and
how
its
loss
was
a
herald
of
my
gain
of
a
guru
can
not
be
told
in
this
chapter
but
the
small
boy
thwarted
in
his
attempts
to
reach
the
himalayas
daily
traveled
far
on
the
wings
of
his
amulet

of

the
title

the
formal
respect
of
the

the
indian
custom
whereby
parents
choose
the

their
child
has
resisted
the
blunt
assaults
of
time
the
percentage
is
high
of
happy

marriages
an
anchorite
one
who
pursues
a
sadhana
or
path
of
spiritual
discipline
when
i
discovered
by
these
words
that
mother
had
possessed
secret
knowledge
of
a
short
life
i
understood
for
the
first
time
why
she
had
been
insistent
on
hastening
the
plans
for
marriage
though
she
died
before
the
wedding
her
natural
maternal
wish
had
been
to
witness
the
rites

respect

saint
with
two
bodies
father
if
i
promise
to
return
home
without
coercion
may
i
take
a
trip
to
benares
my
keen
love
of
travel
was
seldom
hindered
by
father
he
permitted
me
even
as
a
mere
boy
to
visit
many
cities
and
pilgrimage
spots
usually
one
or
more
of
my
friends
accompanied
me
we
would
travel
comfortably
on
passes
provided
by
father
his
position
as
a
railroad
official
was
fully
satisfactory
to
the
nomads
in
the
family
father
promised
to
give
my
request
due
consideration
the
next
day
he
summoned
me
and
held
out
a
pass
from
bareilly
to
benares
a
number
of
rupee
notes
and
two
letters
i
have
a
business
matter
to
propose
to
a
benares
friend
kedar
nath
babu
unfortunately
i
have
lost
his
address
but
i
believe
you
will
be
able
to
get
this
letter
to
him
through
our
common
friend
swami
pranabananda
the
swami
my
brother
disciple
has
attained
an
exalted
spiritual
stature
you
will
benefit
by
his
company
this
second
note
will
serve
as
your
introduction
father
eyes
twinkled
as
he
added
mind
no
more
flights
from
home
i
set
forth
with
the
zest
of
my
twelve
years
though
time
has
never
dimmed
my
delight
in
new
scenes
and
strange
faces
reaching
benares
i
proceeded
immediately
to
the
swami
residence
the
front
door
was
open
i
made
my
way
to
a
long
room
on
the
second
floor
a
rather
stout
man
wearing
only
a
loincloth
was
seated
in
lotus
posture
on
a
slightly
raised
platform
his
head
and
unwrinkled
face
were
a
beatific
smile
played
about
his
lips
to
dispel
my
thought
that
i
had
intruded
he
greeted
me
as
an
old
friend
baba
anand
bliss
to
my
dear
one
his
welcome
was
given
heartily
in
a
childlike
voice
i
knelt
and
touched
his
feet
are
you
swami
pranabananda
he
nodded
are
you
bhagabati
son
his
words
were
out
before
i
had
had
time
to
get
father
letter
from
my
pocket
in
astonishment
i
handed
him
the
note
of
introduction
which
now
seemed
superfluous
of
course
i
will
locate
kedar
nath
babu
for
you
the
saint
again
surprised
me
by
his
clairvoyance
he
glanced
at
the
letter
and
made
a
few
affectionate
references
to
my
parent
you
know
i
am
enjoying
two
pensions
one
is
by
the
recommendation
of
your
father
for
whom
i
once
worked
in
the
railroad
office
the
other
is
by
the
recommendation
of
my
heavenly
father
for
whom
i
have
conscientiously
finished
my
earthly
duties
in
life
i
found
this
remark
very
obscure
what
kind
of
pension
sir
do
you
receive
from
the
heavenly
father
does
he
drop
money
in
your
lap
he
laughed
i
mean
a
pension
of
fathomless
reward
for
many
years
of
deep
meditation
i
never
crave
money
now
my
few
material
needs
are
amply
provided
for
later
you
will
understand
the
significance
of
a
second
pension
abruptly
terminating
our
conversation
the
saint
became
gravely
motionless
a
sphinxlike
air
enveloped
him
at
first
his
eyes
sparkled
as
if
observing
something
of
interest
then
grew
dull
i
felt
abashed
at
his
pauciloquy
he
had
not
yet
told
me
how
i
could
meet
father
friend
a
trifle
restlessly
i
looked
about
me
in
the
bare
room
empty
except
for
us
two
my
idle
gaze
took
in
his
wooden
sandals
lying
under
the
platform
seat
little
sir
do
get
worried
the
man
you
wish
to
see
will
be
with
you
in
half
an
hour
the
yogi
was
reading
my
feat
not
too
difficult
at
the
moment
again
he
fell
into
inscrutable
silence
my
watch
informed
me
that
thirty
minutes
had
elapsed
the
swami
aroused
himself
i
think
kedar
nath
babu
is
nearing
the
door
i
heard
somebody
coming
up
the
stairs
an
amazed
incomprehension
arose
suddenly
my
thoughts
raced
in
confusion
how
is
it
possible
that
father
friend
has
been
summoned
to
this
place
without
the
help
of
a
messenger
the
swami
has
spoken
to
no
one
but
myself
since
my
arrival
abruptly
i
quitted
the
room
and
descended
the
steps
halfway
down
i
met
a
thin
man
of
medium
height
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
hurry
are
you
kedar
nath
babu
excitement
colored
my
voice
yes
are
you
not
bhagabati
son
who
has
been
waiting
here
to
meet
me
he
smiled
in
friendly
fashion
sir
how
do
you
happen
to
come
here
i
felt
baffled
resentment
over
his
inexplicable
presence
everything
is
mysterious
today
less
than
an
hour
ago
i
had
just
finished
my
bath
in
the
ganges
when
swami
pranabananda
approached
me
i
have
no
idea
how
he
knew
i
was
there
at
that
time
son
is
waiting
for
you
in
my
apartment
he
said
you
come
with
me
i
gladly
agreed
as
we
proceeded
hand
in
hand
the
swami
in
his
wooden
sandals
was
strangely
able
to
outpace
me
though
i
wore
these
stout
walking
shoes
long
will
it
take
you
to
reach
my
place
pranabanandaji
suddenly
halted
to
ask
me
this
question
half
an
hour
have
something
else
to
do
at
present
he
gave
me
an
enigmatical
glance
must
leave
you
behind
you
can
join
me
in
my
house
where
bhagabati
son
and
i
will
be
awaiting
you
before
i
could
remonstrate
he
dashed
swiftly
past
me
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
i
walked
here
as
fast
as
possible
this
explanation
only
increased
my
bewilderment
i
inquired
how
long
he
had
known
the
swami
we
met
a
few
times
last
year
but
not
recently
i
was
very
glad
to
see
him
again
today
at
the
bathing
ghat
i
can
not
believe
my
ears
am
i
losing
my
mind
did
you
meet
him
in
a
vision
or
did
you
actually
see
him
touch
his
hand
and
hear
the
sound
of
his
feet
i
do
know
what
you
driving
at
he
flushed
angrily
i
am
not
lying
to
you
ca
you
understand
that
only
through
the
swami
could
i
have
known
you
were
waiting
at
this
place
for
me
why
that
man
swami
pranabananda
has
not
left
my
sight
a
moment
since
i
first
came
about
an
hour
ago
i
blurted
out
the
whole
story
his
eyes
opened
widely
are
we
living
in
this
material
age
or
are
we
dreaming
i
never
expected
to
witness
such
a
miracle
in
my
life
i
thought
this
swami
was
just
an
ordinary
man
and
now
i
find
he
can
materialize
an
extra
body
and
work
through
it
together
we
entered
the
saint
room
look
those
are
the
very
sandals
he
was
wearing
at
the
ghat
kedar
nath
babu
whispered
he
was
clad
only
in
a
loincloth
just
as
i
see
him
now
as
the
visitor
bowed
before
him
the
saint
turned
to
me
with
a
quizzical
smile
why
are
you
stupefied
at
all
this
the
subtle
unity
of
the
phenomenal
world
is
not
hidden
from
true
yogis
i
instantly
see
and
converse
with
my
disciples
in
distant
calcutta
they
can
similarly
transcend
at
will
every
obstacle
of
gross
matter
it
was
probably
in
an
effort
to
stir
spiritual
ardor
in
my
young
breast
that
the
swami
had
condescended
to
tell
me
of
his
powers
of
astral
radio
and
television
but
instead
of
enthusiasm
i
experienced
only
an
fear
inasmuch
as
i
was
destined
to
undertake
my
divine
search
through
one
particular
yukteswar
whom
i
had
not
yet
felt
no
inclination
to
accept
pranabananda
as
my
teacher
i
glanced
at
him
doubtfully
wondering
if
it
were
he
or
his
counterpart
before
me
illustration
swami
pranabananda
the
saint
with
two
bodies
an
exalted
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
see
the
master
sought
to
banish
my
disquietude
by
bestowing
a
gaze
and
by
some
inspiring
words
about
his
guru
lahiri
mahasaya
was
the
greatest
yogi
i
ever
knew
he
was
divinity
itself
in
the
form
of
flesh
if
a
disciple
i
reflected
could
materialize
an
extra
fleshly
form
at
will
what
miracles
indeed
could
be
barred
to
his
master
i
will
tell
you
how
priceless
is
a
guru
help
i
used
to
meditate
with
another
disciple
for
eight
hours
every
night
we
had
to
work
at
the
railroad
office
during
the
day
finding
difficulty
in
carrying
on
my
clerical
duties
i
desired
to
devote
my
whole
time
to
god
for
eight
years
i
persevered
meditating
half
the
night
i
had
wonderful
results
tremendous
spiritual
perceptions
illumined
my
mind
but
a
little
veil
always
remained
between
me
and
the
infinite
even
with
earnestness
i
found
the
final
irrevocable
union
to
be
denied
me
one
evening
i
paid
a
visit
to
lahiri
mahasaya
and
pleaded
for
his
divine
intercession
my
importunities
continued
during
the
entire
night
guru
my
spiritual
anguish
is
such
that
i
can
no
longer
bear
my
life
without
meeting
the
great
beloved
face
to
face
can
i
do
you
must
meditate
more
profoundly
am
appealing
to
thee
o
god
my
master
i
see
thee
materialized
before
me
in
a
physical
body
bless
me
that
i
may
perceive
thee
in
thine
infinite
form
lahiri
mahasaya
extended
his
hand
in
a
benign
gesture
may
go
now
and
meditate
i
have
interceded
for
you
with
brahma
immeasurably
uplifted
i
returned
to
my
home
in
meditation
that
night
the
burning
goal
of
my
life
was
achieved
now
i
ceaselessly
enjoy
the
spiritual
pension
never
from
that
day
has
the
blissful
creator
remained
hidden
from
my
eyes
behind
any
screen
of
delusion
pranabananda
face
was
suffused
with
divine
light
the
peace
of
another
world
entered
my
heart
all
fear
had
fled
the
saint
made
a
further
confidence
some
months
later
i
returned
to
lahiri
mahasaya
and
tried
to
thank
him
for
his
bestowal
of
the
infinite
gift
then
i
mentioned
another
matter
guru
i
can
no
longer
work
in
the
office
please
release
me
brahma
keeps
me
continuously
intoxicated
for
a
pension
from
your
company
reason
shall
i
give
so
early
in
my
service
what
you
feel
the
next
day
i
made
my
application
the
doctor
inquired
the
grounds
for
my
premature
request
work
i
find
an
overpowering
sensation
rising
in
my
spine
it
permeates
my
whole
body
unfitting
me
for
the
performance
of
my
duties
without
further
questioning
the
physician
recommended
me
highly
for
a
pension
which
i
soon
received
i
know
the
divine
will
of
lahiri
mahasaya
worked
through
the
doctor
and
the
railroad
officials
including
your
father
automatically
they
obeyed
the
great
spiritual
direction
and
freed
me
for
a
life
of
unbroken
communion
with
the
beloved
after
this
extraordinary
revelation
swami
pranabananda
retired
into
one
of
his
long
silences
as
i
was
taking
leave
touching
his
feet
reverently
he
gave
me
his
blessing
your
life
belongs
to
the
path
of
renunciation
and
yoga
i
shall
see
you
again
with
your
father
later
on
the
years
brought
fulfillment
to
both
these
predictions
kedar
nath
babu
walked
by
my
side
in
the
gathering
darkness
i
delivered
father
letter
which
my
companion
read
under
a
street
lamp
your
father
suggests
that
i
take
a
position
in
the
calcutta
office
of
his
railroad
company
how
pleasant
to
look
forward
to
at
least
one
of
the
pensions
that
swami
pranabananda
enjoys
but
it
is
impossible
i
can
not
leave
benares
alas
two
bodies
are
not
yet
for
me
choto
mahasaya
is
the
term
by
which
a
number
of
indian
saints
addressed
me
it
translates
little
in
its
own
way
physical
science
is
affirming
the
validity
of
laws
discovered
by
yogis
through
mental
science
for
example
a
demonstration
that
man
has
televisional
powers
was
given
on
at
the
royal
university
of
rome
giuseppe
calligaris
professor
of
pressed
certain
points
of
a
body
and
the
subject
responded
with
minute
descriptions
of
other
persons
and
objects
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
wall
calligaris
told
the
other
professors
that
if
certain
areas
on
the
skin
are
agitated
the
subject
is
given
impressions
enabling
him
to
see
objects
that
he
could
not
otherwise
perceive
to
enable
his
subject
to
discern
things
on
the
other
side
of
a
wall
professor
calligaris
pressed
on
a
spot
to
the
right
of
the
thorax
for
fifteen
minutes
calligaris
said
that
if
other
spots
of
the
body
were
agitated
the
subjects
could
see
objects
at
any
distance
regardless
of
whether
they
had
ever
before
seen
those
god
in
his
aspect
of
creator
from
sanskrit
root
brih
to
expand
when
emerson
poem
brahma
appeared
in
the
atlantic
monthly
in
most
the
readers
were
bewildered
emerson
chuckled
tell
them
he
said
to
say
instead
of
and
they
will
not
feel
any
perplexity
in
deep
meditation
the
first
experience
of
spirit
is
on
the
altar
of
the
spine
and
then
in
the
brain
the
torrential
bliss
is
overwhelming
but
the
yogi
learns
to
control
its
outward
manifestations
after
his
retirement
pranabananda
wrote
one
of
the
most
profound
commentaries
on
the
bhagavad
gita
available
in
bengali
and
hindi
see
chapter
chapter
my
interrupted
flight
toward
the
himalayas
leave
your
classroom
on
some
trifling
pretext
and
engage
a
hackney
carriage
stop
in
the
lane
where
no
one
in
my
house
can
see
you
these
were
my
final
instructions
to
amar
mitter
a
high
school
friend
who
planned
to
accompany
me
to
the
himalayas
we
had
chosen
the
following
day
for
our
flight
precautions
were
necessary
as
ananta
exercised
a
vigilant
eye
he
was
determined
to
foil
the
plans
of
escape
which
he
suspected
were
uppermost
in
my
mind
the
amulet
like
a
spiritual
yeast
was
silently
at
work
within
me
amidst
the
himalayan
snows
i
hoped
to
find
the
master
whose
face
often
appeared
to
me
in
visions
the
family
was
living
now
in
calcutta
where
father
had
been
permanently
transferred
following
the
patriarchal
indian
custom
ananta
had
brought
his
bride
to
live
in
our
home
now
at
gurpar
road
there
in
a
small
attic
room
i
engaged
in
daily
meditations
and
prepared
my
mind
for
the
divine
search
the
memorable
morning
arrived
with
inauspicious
rain
hearing
the
wheels
of
amar
carriage
in
the
road
i
hastily
tied
together
a
blanket
a
pair
of
sandals
lahiri
mahasaya
picture
a
copy
of
the
bhagavad
gita
a
string
of
prayer
beads
and
two
loincloths
this
bundle
i
threw
from
my
window
i
ran
down
the
steps
and
passed
my
uncle
buying
fish
at
the
door
what
is
the
excitement
his
gaze
roved
suspiciously
over
my
person
i
gave
him
a
noncommittal
smile
and
walked
to
the
lane
retrieving
my
bundle
i
joined
amar
with
conspiratorial
caution
we
drove
to
chadni
chowk
a
merchandise
center
for
months
we
had
been
saving
our
tiffin
money
to
buy
english
clothes
knowing
that
my
clever
brother
could
easily
play
the
part
of
a
detective
we
thought
to
outwit
him
by
european
garb
on
the
way
to
the
station
we
stopped
for
my
cousin
jotin
ghosh
whom
i
called
jatinda
he
was
a
new
convert
longing
for
a
guru
in
the
himalayas
he
donned
the
new
suit
we
had
in
readiness
we
hoped
a
deep
elation
possessed
our
hearts
all
we
need
now
are
canvas
shoes
i
led
my
companions
to
a
shop
displaying
footwear
articles
of
leather
gotten
only
through
the
slaughter
of
animals
must
be
absent
on
this
holy
trip
i
halted
on
the
street
to
remove
the
leather
cover
from
my
bhagavad
gita
and
the
leather
straps
from
my
sola
topee
helmet
at
the
station
we
bought
tickets
to
burdwan
where
we
planned
to
transfer
for
hardwar
in
the
himalayan
foothills
as
soon
as
the
train
like
ourselves
was
in
flight
i
gave
utterance
to
a
few
of
my
glorious
anticipations
just
imagine
i
ejaculated
we
shall
be
initiated
by
the
masters
and
experience
the
trance
of
cosmic
consciousness
our
flesh
will
be
charged
with
such
magnetism
that
wild
animals
of
the
himalayas
will
come
tamely
near
us
tigers
will
be
no
more
than
meek
house
cats
awaiting
our
caresses
this
a
prospect
i
considered
entrancing
both
metaphorically
and
an
enthusiastic
smile
from
amar
but
jatinda
averted
his
gaze
directing
it
through
the
window
at
the
scampering
landscape
let
the
money
be
divided
in
three
portions
jatinda
broke
a
long
silence
with
this
suggestion
each
of
us
should
buy
his
own
ticket
at
burdwan
thus
no
one
at
the
station
will
surmise
that
we
are
running
away
together
i
unsuspectingly
agreed
at
dusk
our
train
stopped
at
burdwan
jatinda
entered
the
ticket
office
amar
and
i
sat
on
the
platform
we
waited
fifteen
minutes
then
made
unavailing
inquiries
searching
in
all
directions
we
shouted
jatinda
name
with
the
urgency
of
fright
but
he
had
faded
into
the
dark
unknown
surrounding
the
little
station
i
was
completely
unnerved
shocked
to
a
peculiar
numbness
that
god
would
countenance
this
depressing
episode
the
romantic
occasion
of
my
first
flight
after
him
was
cruelly
marred
amar
we
must
return
home
i
was
weeping
like
a
child
callous
departure
is
an
ill
omen
this
trip
is
doomed
to
failure
is
this
your
love
for
the
lord
ca
you
stand
the
little
test
of
a
treacherous
companion
through
amar
suggestion
of
a
divine
test
my
heart
steadied
itself
we
refreshed
ourselves
with
famous
burdwan
sweetmeats
sitabhog
food
for
the
goddess
and
motichur
nuggets
of
sweet
pearl
in
a
few
hours
we
entrained
for
hardwar
via
bareilly
changing
trains
at
moghul
serai
we
discussed
a
vital
matter
as
we
waited
on
the
platform
amar
we
may
soon
be
closely
questioned
by
railroad
officials
i
am
not
underrating
my
brother
ingenuity
no
matter
what
the
outcome
i
will
not
speak
untruth
all
i
ask
of
you
mukunda
is
to
keep
still
do
laugh
or
grin
while
i
am
talking
at
this
moment
a
european
station
agent
accosted
me
he
waved
a
telegram
whose
import
i
immediately
grasped
are
you
running
away
from
home
in
anger
no
i
was
glad
his
choice
of
words
permitted
me
to
make
emphatic
reply
not
anger
but
divinest
melancholy
was
responsible
i
knew
for
my
unconventional
behavior
the
official
then
turned
to
amar
the
duel
of
wits
that
followed
hardly
permitted
me
to
maintain
the
counseled
stoic
gravity
where
is
the
third
boy
the
man
injected
a
full
ring
of
authority
into
his
voice
come
on
speak
the
truth
sir
i
notice
you
are
wearing
eyeglasses
ca
you
see
that
we
are
only
two
amar
smiled
impudently
i
am
not
a
magician
i
ca
conjure
up
a
third
companion
the
official
noticeably
disconcerted
by
this
impertinence
sought
a
new
field
of
attack
what
is
your
name
i
am
called
thomas
i
am
the
son
of
an
english
mother
and
a
converted
christian
indian
father
what
is
your
friend
name
i
call
him
thompson
by
this
time
my
inward
mirth
had
reached
a
zenith
i
unceremoniously
made
for
the
train
whistling
for
departure
amar
followed
with
the
official
who
was
credulous
and
obliging
enough
to
put
us
into
a
european
compartment
it
evidently
pained
him
to
think
of
two
boys
traveling
in
the
section
allotted
to
natives
after
his
polite
exit
i
lay
back
on
the
seat
and
laughed
uncontrollably
my
friend
wore
an
expression
of
blithe
satisfaction
at
having
outwitted
a
veteran
european
official
on
the
platform
i
had
contrived
to
read
the
telegram
from
my
brother
it
went
thus
three
bengali
boys
in
english
clothes
running
away
from
home
toward
hardwar
via
moghul
serai
please
detain
them
until
my
arrival
ample
reward
for
your
services
amar
i
told
you
not
to
leave
marked
timetables
in
your
home
my
glance
was
reproachful
brother
must
have
found
one
there
my
friend
sheepishly
acknowledged
the
thrust
we
halted
briefly
in
bareilly
where
dwarka
prasad
awaited
us
with
a
telegram
from
ananta
my
old
friend
tried
valiantly
to
detain
us
i
convinced
him
that
our
flight
had
not
been
undertaken
lightly
as
on
a
previous
occasion
dwarka
refused
my
invitation
to
set
forth
to
the
himalayas
while
our
train
stood
in
a
station
that
night
and
i
was
half
asleep
amar
was
awakened
by
another
questioning
official
he
too
fell
a
victim
to
the
hybrid
charms
of
thomas
and
thompson
the
train
bore
us
triumphantly
into
a
dawn
arrival
at
hardwar
the
majestic
mountains
loomed
invitingly
in
the
distance
we
dashed
through
the
station
and
entered
the
freedom
of
city
crowds
our
first
act
was
to
change
into
native
costume
as
ananta
had
somehow
penetrated
our
european
disguise
a
premonition
of
capture
weighed
on
my
mind
deeming
it
advisable
to
leave
hardwar
at
once
we
bought
tickets
to
proceed
north
to
rishikesh
a
soil
long
hallowed
by
feet
of
many
masters
i
had
already
boarded
the
train
while
amar
lagged
on
the
platform
he
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
halt
by
a
shout
from
a
policeman
our
unwelcome
guardian
escorted
us
to
a
station
bungalow
and
took
charge
of
our
money
he
explained
courteously
that
it
was
his
duty
to
hold
us
until
my
elder
brother
arrived
learning
that
the
truants
destination
had
been
the
himalayas
the
officer
related
a
strange
story
i
see
you
are
crazy
about
saints
you
will
never
meet
a
greater
man
of
god
than
the
one
i
saw
only
yesterday
my
brother
officer
and
i
first
encountered
him
five
days
ago
we
were
patrolling
by
the
ganges
on
a
sharp
lookout
for
a
certain
murderer
our
instructions
were
to
capture
him
alive
or
dead
he
was
known
to
be
masquerading
as
a
sadhu
in
order
to
rob
pilgrims
a
short
way
before
us
we
spied
a
figure
which
resembled
the
description
of
the
criminal
he
ignored
our
command
to
stop
we
ran
to
overpower
him
approaching
his
back
i
wielded
my
ax
with
tremendous
force
the
man
right
arm
was
severed
almost
completely
from
his
body
without
outcry
or
any
glance
at
the
ghastly
wound
the
stranger
astonishingly
continued
his
swift
pace
as
we
jumped
in
front
of
him
he
spoke
quietly
am
not
the
murderer
you
are
seeking
i
was
deeply
mortified
to
see
i
had
injured
the
person
of
a
divine
looking
sage
prostrating
myself
at
his
feet
i
implored
his
pardon
and
offered
my
to
staunch
the
heavy
spurts
of
blood
that
was
just
an
understandable
mistake
on
your
part
the
saint
regarded
me
kindly
along
and
do
reproach
yourself
the
beloved
mother
is
taking
care
of
me
he
pushed
his
dangling
arm
into
its
stump
and
lo
it
adhered
the
blood
inexplicably
ceased
to
flow
to
me
under
yonder
tree
in
three
days
and
you
will
find
me
fully
healed
thus
you
will
feel
no
remorse
yesterday
my
brother
officer
and
i
went
eagerly
to
the
designated
spot
the
sadhu
was
there
and
allowed
us
to
examine
his
arm
it
bore
no
scar
or
trace
of
hurt
am
going
via
rishikesh
to
the
himalayan
solitudes
he
blessed
us
as
he
departed
quickly
i
feel
that
my
life
has
been
uplifted
through
his
sanctity
the
officer
concluded
with
a
pious
ejaculation
his
experience
had
obviously
moved
him
beyond
his
usual
depths
with
an
impressive
gesture
he
handed
me
a
printed
clipping
about
the
miracle
in
the
usual
garbled
manner
of
the
sensational
type
of
newspaper
not
missing
alas
even
in
india
the
reporter
version
was
slightly
exaggerated
it
indicated
that
the
sadhu
had
been
almost
decapitated
amar
and
i
lamented
that
we
had
missed
the
great
yogi
who
could
forgive
his
persecutor
in
such
a
christlike
way
india
materially
poor
for
the
last
two
centuries
yet
has
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
divine
wealth
spiritual
skyscrapers
may
occasionally
be
encountered
by
the
wayside
even
by
worldly
men
like
this
policeman
we
thanked
the
officer
for
relieving
our
tedium
with
his
marvelous
story
he
was
probably
intimating
that
he
was
more
fortunate
than
we
he
had
met
an
illumined
saint
without
effort
our
earnest
search
had
ended
not
at
the
feet
of
a
master
but
in
a
coarse
police
station
so
near
the
himalayas
and
yet
in
our
captivity
so
far
i
told
amar
i
felt
doubly
impelled
to
seek
freedom
let
us
slip
away
when
opportunity
offers
we
can
go
on
foot
to
holy
rishikesh
i
smiled
encouragingly
but
my
companion
had
turned
pessimist
as
soon
as
the
stalwart
prop
of
our
money
had
been
taken
from
us
if
we
started
a
trek
over
such
dangerous
jungle
land
we
should
finish
not
in
the
city
of
saints
but
in
the
stomachs
of
tigers
ananta
and
amar
brother
arrived
after
three
days
amar
greeted
his
relative
with
affectionate
relief
i
was
unreconciled
ananta
got
no
more
from
me
than
a
severe
upbraiding
i
understand
how
you
feel
my
brother
spoke
soothingly
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
accompany
me
to
benares
to
meet
a
certain
saint
and
go
on
to
calcutta
to
visit
your
grieving
father
for
a
few
days
then
you
can
resume
your
search
here
for
a
master
amar
entered
the
conversation
at
this
point
to
disclaim
any
intention
of
returning
to
hardwar
with
me
he
was
enjoying
the
familial
warmth
but
i
knew
i
would
never
abandon
the
quest
for
my
guru
our
party
entrained
for
benares
there
i
had
a
singular
and
instant
response
to
my
prayers
a
clever
scheme
had
been
prearranged
by
ananta
before
seeing
me
at
hardwar
he
had
stopped
in
benares
to
ask
a
certain
scriptural
authority
to
interview
me
later
both
the
pundit
and
his
son
had
promised
to
undertake
my
dissuasion
from
the
path
of
a
sannyasi
ananta
took
me
to
their
home
the
son
a
young
man
of
ebullient
manner
greeted
me
in
the
courtyard
he
engaged
me
in
a
lengthy
philosophic
discourse
professing
to
have
a
clairvoyant
knowledge
of
my
future
he
discountenanced
my
idea
of
being
a
monk
you
will
meet
continual
misfortune
and
be
unable
to
find
god
if
you
insist
on
deserting
your
ordinary
responsibilities
you
can
not
work
out
your
past
karma
without
worldly
experiences
krishna
immortal
words
rose
to
my
lips
in
reply
he
with
the
worst
of
karma
who
ceaselessly
meditates
on
me
quickly
loses
the
effects
of
his
past
bad
actions
becoming
a
being
he
soon
attains
perennial
peace
arjuna
know
this
for
certain
the
devotee
who
puts
his
trust
in
me
never
perishes
but
the
forceful
prognostications
of
the
young
man
had
slightly
shaken
my
confidence
with
all
the
fervor
of
my
heart
i
prayed
silently
to
god
please
solve
my
bewilderment
and
answer
me
right
here
and
now
if
thou
dost
desire
me
to
lead
the
life
of
a
renunciate
or
a
worldly
man
i
noticed
a
sadhu
of
noble
countenance
standing
just
outside
the
compound
of
the
pundit
house
evidently
he
had
overheard
the
spirited
conversation
between
the
clairvoyant
and
myself
for
the
stranger
called
me
to
his
side
i
felt
a
tremendous
power
flowing
from
his
calm
eyes
son
do
listen
to
that
ignoramus
in
response
to
your
prayer
the
lord
tells
me
to
assure
you
that
your
sole
path
in
this
life
is
that
of
the
renunciate
with
astonishment
as
well
as
gratitude
i
smiled
happily
at
this
decisive
message
come
away
from
that
man
the
ignoramus
was
calling
me
from
the
courtyard
my
saintly
guide
raised
his
hand
in
blessing
and
slowly
departed
that
sadhu
is
just
as
crazy
as
you
are
it
was
the
pundit
who
made
this
charming
observation
he
and
his
son
were
gazing
at
me
lugubriously
i
heard
that
he
too
has
left
his
home
in
a
vague
search
for
god
i
turned
away
to
ananta
i
remarked
that
i
would
not
engage
in
further
discussion
with
our
hosts
my
brother
agreed
to
an
immediate
departure
we
soon
entrained
for
calcutta
illustration
i
stand
behind
my
elder
brother
see
illustration
last
solstice
festival
celebrated
by
sri
yukteswar
december
my
guru
is
seated
in
the
center
i
am
at
his
right
in
the
large
courtyard
of
his
hermitage
in
see
detective
how
did
you
discover
i
had
fled
with
two
companions
i
vented
my
lively
curiosity
to
ananta
during
our
homeward
journey
he
smiled
mischievously
at
your
school
i
found
that
amar
had
left
his
classroom
and
had
not
returned
i
went
to
his
home
the
next
morning
and
unearthed
a
marked
timetable
amar
father
was
just
leaving
by
carriage
and
was
talking
to
the
coachman
son
will
not
ride
with
me
to
his
school
this
morning
he
has
disappeared
the
father
moaned
heard
from
a
brother
coachman
that
your
son
and
two
others
dressed
in
european
suits
boarded
the
train
at
howrah
station
the
man
stated
made
a
present
of
their
leather
shoes
to
the
cab
driver
thus
i
had
three
timetable
the
trio
of
boys
and
the
english
clothing
i
was
listening
to
ananta
disclosures
with
mingled
mirth
and
vexation
our
generosity
to
the
coachman
had
been
slightly
misplaced
of
course
i
rushed
to
send
telegrams
to
station
officials
in
all
the
cities
which
amar
had
underlined
in
the
timetable
he
had
checked
bareilly
so
i
wired
your
friend
dwarka
there
after
inquiries
in
our
calcutta
neighborhood
i
learned
that
cousin
jatinda
had
been
absent
one
night
but
had
arrived
home
the
following
morning
in
european
garb
i
sought
him
out
and
invited
him
to
dinner
he
accepted
quite
disarmed
by
my
friendly
manner
on
the
way
i
led
him
unsuspectingly
to
a
police
station
he
was
surrounded
by
several
officers
whom
i
had
previously
selected
for
their
ferocious
appearance
under
their
formidable
gaze
jatinda
agreed
to
account
for
his
mysterious
conduct
started
for
the
himalayas
in
a
buoyant
spiritual
mood
he
explained
filled
me
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
the
masters
but
as
soon
as
mukunda
said
during
our
ecstasies
in
the
himalayan
caves
tigers
will
be
spellbound
and
sit
around
us
like
tame
pussies
my
spirits
froze
beads
of
perspiration
formed
on
my
brow
what
then
i
thought
if
the
vicious
nature
of
the
tigers
be
not
changed
through
the
power
of
our
spiritual
trance
shall
they
treat
us
with
the
kindness
of
house
cats
in
my
eye
i
already
saw
myself
the
compulsory
inmate
of
some
there
not
at
once
with
the
whole
body
but
by
installments
of
its
several
parts
my
anger
at
jatinda
vanishment
was
evaporated
in
laughter
the
hilarious
sequel
on
the
train
was
worth
all
the
anguish
he
had
caused
me
i
must
confess
to
a
slight
feeling
of
satisfaction
jatinda
too
had
not
escaped
an
encounter
with
the
police
ananta
you
are
a
born
sleuthhound
my
glance
of
amusement
was
not
without
some
exasperation
and
i
shall
tell
jatinda
i
am
glad
he
was
prompted
by
no
mood
of
treachery
as
it
appeared
but
only
by
the
prudent
instinct
of
at
home
in
calcutta
father
touchingly
requested
me
to
curb
my
roving
feet
until
at
least
the
completion
of
my
high
school
studies
in
my
absence
he
had
lovingly
hatched
a
plot
by
arranging
for
a
saintly
pundit
swami
kebalananda
to
come
regularly
to
the
house
the
sage
will
be
your
sanskrit
tutor
my
parent
announced
confidently
father
hoped
to
satisfy
my
religious
yearnings
by
instructions
from
a
learned
philosopher
but
the
tables
were
subtly
turned
my
new
teacher
far
from
offering
intellectual
aridities
fanned
the
embers
of
my
unknown
to
father
swami
kebalananda
was
an
exalted
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
the
peerless
guru
had
possessed
thousands
of
disciples
silently
drawn
to
him
by
the
irresistibility
of
his
divine
magnetism
i
learned
later
that
lahiri
mahasaya
had
often
characterized
kebalananda
as
rishi
or
illumined
sage
luxuriant
curls
framed
my
tutor
handsome
face
his
dark
eyes
were
guileless
with
the
transparency
of
a
child
all
the
movements
of
his
slight
body
were
marked
by
a
restful
deliberation
ever
gentle
and
loving
he
was
firmly
established
in
the
infinite
consciousness
many
of
our
happy
hours
together
were
spent
in
deep
kriya
meditation
kebalananda
was
a
noted
authority
on
the
ancient
shastras
or
sacred
books
his
erudition
had
earned
him
the
title
of
shastri
mahasaya
by
which
he
was
usually
addressed
but
my
progress
in
sanskrit
scholarship
was
unnoteworthy
i
sought
every
opportunity
to
forsake
prosaic
grammar
and
to
talk
of
yoga
and
lahiri
mahasaya
my
tutor
obliged
me
one
day
by
telling
me
something
of
his
own
life
with
the
master
rarely
fortunate
i
was
able
to
remain
near
lahiri
mahasaya
for
ten
years
his
benares
home
was
my
nightly
goal
of
pilgrimage
the
guru
was
always
present
in
a
small
front
parlor
on
the
first
floor
as
he
sat
in
lotus
posture
on
a
backless
wooden
seat
his
disciples
garlanded
him
in
a
semicircle
his
eyes
sparkled
and
danced
with
the
joy
of
the
divine
they
were
ever
half
closed
peering
through
the
inner
telescopic
orb
into
a
sphere
of
eternal
bliss
he
seldom
spoke
at
length
occasionally
his
gaze
would
focus
on
a
student
in
need
of
help
healing
words
poured
then
like
an
avalanche
of
light
an
indescribable
peace
blossomed
within
me
at
the
master
glance
i
was
permeated
with
his
fragrance
as
though
from
a
lotus
of
infinity
to
be
with
him
even
without
exchanging
a
word
for
days
was
experience
which
changed
my
entire
being
if
any
invisible
barrier
rose
in
the
path
of
my
concentration
i
would
meditate
at
the
guru
feet
there
the
most
tenuous
states
came
easily
within
my
grasp
such
perceptions
eluded
me
in
the
presence
of
lesser
teachers
the
master
was
a
living
temple
of
god
whose
secret
doors
were
open
to
all
disciples
through
devotion
lahiri
mahasaya
was
no
bookish
interpreter
of
the
scriptures
effortlessly
he
dipped
into
the
library
foam
of
words
and
spray
of
thoughts
gushed
from
the
fountain
of
his
omniscience
he
had
the
wondrous
clavis
which
unlocked
the
profound
philosophical
science
embedded
ages
ago
in
the
vedas
if
asked
to
explain
the
different
planes
of
consciousness
mentioned
in
the
ancient
texts
he
would
smilingly
assent
will
undergo
those
states
and
presently
tell
you
what
i
perceive
he
was
thus
diametrically
unlike
the
teachers
who
commit
scripture
to
memory
and
then
give
forth
unrealized
abstractions
expound
the
holy
stanzas
as
the
meaning
occurs
to
you
the
taciturn
guru
often
gave
this
instruction
to
a
disciple
will
guide
your
thoughts
that
the
right
interpretation
be
uttered
in
this
way
many
of
lahiri
mahasaya
perceptions
came
to
be
recorded
with
voluminous
commentaries
by
various
students
the
master
never
counseled
slavish
belief
are
only
shells
he
said
conviction
of
god
presence
through
your
own
joyous
contact
in
meditation
no
matter
what
the
disciple
problem
the
guru
advised
kriya
yoga
for
its
solution
yogic
key
will
not
lose
its
efficiency
when
i
am
no
longer
present
in
the
body
to
guide
you
this
technique
can
not
be
bound
filed
and
forgotten
in
the
manner
of
theoretical
inspirations
continue
ceaselessly
on
your
path
to
liberation
through
kriya
whose
power
lies
in
practice
i
myself
consider
kriya
the
most
effective
device
of
salvation
through
ever
to
be
evolved
in
man
search
for
the
infinite
kebalananda
concluded
with
this
earnest
testimony
through
its
use
the
omnipotent
god
hidden
in
all
men
became
visibly
incarnated
in
the
flesh
of
lahiri
mahasaya
and
a
number
of
his
disciples
a
christlike
miracle
by
lahiri
mahasaya
took
place
in
presence
my
saintly
tutor
recounted
the
story
one
day
his
eyes
remote
from
the
sanskrit
texts
before
us
a
blind
disciple
ramu
aroused
my
active
pity
should
he
have
no
light
in
his
eyes
when
he
faithfully
served
our
master
in
whom
the
divine
was
fully
blazing
one
morning
i
sought
to
speak
to
ramu
but
he
sat
for
patient
hours
fanning
the
guru
with
a
punkha
when
the
devotee
finally
left
the
room
i
followed
him
how
long
have
you
been
blind
my
birth
sir
never
have
my
eyes
been
blessed
with
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
omnipotent
guru
can
help
you
please
make
a
supplication
the
following
day
ramu
diffidently
approached
lahiri
mahasaya
the
disciple
felt
almost
ashamed
to
ask
that
physical
wealth
be
added
to
his
spiritual
superabundance
the
illuminator
of
the
cosmos
is
in
you
i
pray
you
to
bring
his
light
into
my
eyes
that
i
perceive
the
sun
lesser
glow
someone
has
connived
to
put
me
in
a
difficult
position
i
have
no
healing
power
the
infinite
one
within
you
can
certainly
heal
is
indeed
different
ramu
god
limit
is
nowhere
he
who
ignites
the
stars
and
the
cells
of
flesh
with
mysterious
can
surely
bring
luster
of
vision
into
your
eyes
the
master
touched
ramu
forehead
at
the
point
between
the
eyebrows
your
mind
concentrated
there

frequently
chant
the
name
of
the
prophet
rama
for
seven
days
the
splendor
of
the
sun
shall
have
a
special
dawn
for
you
lo
in
one
week
it
was
so
for
the
first
time
ramu
beheld
the
fair
face
of
nature
the
omniscient
one
had
unerringly
directed
his
disciple
to
repeat
the
name
of
rama
adored
by
him
above
all
other
saints
ramu
faith
was
the
devotionally
ploughed
soil
in
which
the
guru
powerful
seed
of
permanent
healing
sprouted
kebalananda
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
paid
a
further
tribute
to
his
guru
it
was
evident
in
all
miracles
performed
by
lahiri
mahasaya
that
he
never
allowed
the
to
consider
itself
a
causative
force
by
perfection
of
resistless
surrender
the
master
enabled
the
prime
healing
power
to
flow
freely
through
him
the
numerous
bodies
which
were
spectacularly
healed
through
lahiri
mahasaya
eventually
had
to
feed
the
flames
of
cremation
but
the
silent
spiritual
awakenings
he
effected
the
christlike
disciples
he
fashioned
are
his
imperishable
miracles
i
never
became
a
sanskrit
scholar
kebalananda
taught
me
a
diviner
syntax
literally
renunciate
from
sanskrit
verb
roots
to
cast
aside
effects
of

actions

kebalananda
had
not

joined

referring
to

chapter
a
perfume
saint
displays
his
wonders
to
every
thing
there
is
a
season
and
a
time
to
every
purpose
under
the
heaven
i
did
not
have
this
wisdom
of
solomon
to
comfort
me
i
gazed
searchingly
about
me
on
any
excursion
from
home
for
the
face
of
my
destined
guru
but
my
path
did
not
cross
his
own
until
after
the
completion
of
my
high
school
studies
two
years
elapsed
between
my
flight
with
amar
toward
the
himalayas
and
the
great
day
of
sri
yukteswar
arrival
into
my
life
during
that
interim
i
met
a
number
of
perfume
saint
the
tiger
swami
nagendra
nath
bhaduri
master
mahasaya
and
the
famous
bengali
scientist
jagadis
chandra
bose
my
encounter
with
the
perfume
saint
had
two
preambles
one
harmonious
and
the
other
humorous
god
is
simple
everything
else
is
complex
do
not
seek
absolute
values
in
the
relative
world
of
nature
these
philosophical
finalities
gently
entered
my
ear
as
i
stood
silently
before
a
temple
image
of
kali
turning
i
confronted
a
tall
man
whose
garb
or
lack
of
it
revealed
him
a
wandering
sadhu
you
have
indeed
penetrated
the
bewilderment
of
my
thoughts
i
smiled
gratefully
the
confusion
of
benign
and
terrible
aspects
in
nature
as
symbolized
by
kali
has
puzzled
wiser
heads
than
mine
few
there
be
who
solve
her
mystery
good
and
evil
is
the
challenging
riddle
which
life
places
sphinxlike
before
every
intelligence
attempting
no
solution
most
men
pay
forfeit
with
their
lives
penalty
now
even
as
in
the
days
of
thebes
here
and
there
a
towering
lonely
figure
never
cries
defeat
from
the
maya
of
duality
he
plucks
the
cleaveless
truth
of
unity
you
speak
with
conviction
sir
i
have
long
exercised
an
honest
introspection
the
exquisitely
painful
approach
to
wisdom
relentless
observance
of
one
thoughts
is
a
stark
and
shattering
experience
it
pulverizes
the
stoutest
ego
but
true
mathematically
operates
to
produce
seers
the
way
of
individual
acknowledgments
results
in
egotists
sure
of
the
right
to
their
private
interpretations
of
god
and
the
universe
truth
humbly
retires
no
doubt
before
such
arrogant
originality
i
was
enjoying
the
discussion
man
can
understand
no
eternal
verity
until
he
has
freed
himself
from
pretensions
the
human
mind
bared
to
a
centuried
slime
is
teeming
with
repulsive
life
of
countless
struggles
of
the
battlefields
pale
into
insignificance
here
when
man
first
contends
with
inward
enemies
no
mortal
foes
these
to
be
overcome
by
harrowing
array
of
might
omnipresent
unresting
pursuing
man
even
in
sleep
subtly
equipped
with
a
miasmic
weapon
these
soldiers
of
ignorant
lusts
seek
to
slay
us
all
thoughtless
is
the
man
who
buries
his
ideals
surrendering
to
the
common
fate
can
he
seem
other
than
impotent
wooden
ignominious
respected
sir
have
you
no
sympathy
for
the
bewildered
masses
the
sage
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
answered
obliquely
to
love
both
the
invisible
god
repository
of
all
virtues
and
visible
man
apparently
possessed
of
none
is
often
baffling
but
ingenuity
is
equal
to
the
maze
inner
research
soon
exposes
a
unity
in
all
human
stalwart
kinship
of
selfish
motive
in
one
sense
at
least
the
brotherhood
of
man
stands
revealed
an
aghast
humility
follows
this
leveling
discovery
it
ripens
into
compassion
for
one
fellows
blind
to
the
healing
potencies
of
the
soul
awaiting
exploration
the
saints
of
every
age
sir
have
felt
like
yourself
for
the
sorrows
of
the
world
only
the
shallow
man
loses
responsiveness
to
the
woes
of
lives
as
he
sinks
into
narrow
suffering
of
his
own
the
austere
face
was
noticeably
softened
the
one
who
practices
a
scalpel
will
know
an
expansion
of
universal
pity
release
is
given
him
from
the
deafening
demands
of
his
ego
the
love
of
god
flowers
on
such
soil
the
creature
finally
turns
to
his
creator
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
ask
in
anguish
lord
why
by
ignoble
whips
of
pain
man
is
driven
at
last
into
the
infinite
presence
whose
beauty
alone
should
lure
him
the
sage
and
i
were
present
in
calcutta
kalighat
temple
whither
i
had
gone
to
view
its
famed
magnificence
with
a
sweeping
gesture
my
chance
companion
dismissed
the
ornate
dignity
bricks
and
mortar
sing
us
no
audible
tune
the
heart
opens
only
to
the
human
chant
of
being
we
strolled
to
the
inviting
sunshine
at
the
entrance
where
throngs
of
devotees
were
passing
to
and
fro
you
are
young
the
sage
surveyed
me
thoughtfully
india
too
is
young
the
ancient
rishis
laid
down
ineradicable
patterns
of
spiritual
living
their
hoary
dictums
suffice
for
this
day
and
land
not
outmoded
not
unsophisticated
against
the
guiles
of
materialism
the
disciplinary
precepts
mold
india
still
by
than
embarrassed
scholars
care
to
compute
skeptic
time
has
validated
vedic
worth
take
it
for
your
heritage
as
i
was
reverently
bidding
farewell
to
the
eloquent
sadhu
he
revealed
a
clairvoyant
perception
after
you
leave
here
today
an
unusual
experience
will
come
your
way
i
quitted
the
temple
precincts
and
wandered
along
aimlessly
turning
a
corner
i
ran
into
an
old
of
those
fellows
whose
conversational
powers
ignore
time
and
embrace
eternity
i
will
let
you
go
in
a
very
short
while
if
you
will
tell
me
all
that
has
happened
during
the
six
years
of
our
separation
what
a
paradox
i
must
leave
you
now
but
he
held
me
by
the
hand
forcing
out
tidbits
of
information
he
was
like
a
ravenous
wolf
i
thought
in
amusement
the
longer
i
spoke
the
more
hungrily
he
sniffed
for
news
inwardly
i
petitioned
the
goddess
kali
to
devise
a
graceful
means
of
escape
my
companion
left
me
abruptly
i
sighed
with
relief
and
doubled
my
pace
dreading
any
relapse
into
the
garrulous
fever
hearing
rapid
footsteps
behind
me
i
quickened
my
speed
i
dared
not
look
back
but
with
a
bound
the
youth
rejoined
me
jovially
clasping
my
shoulder
i
forgot
to
tell
you
of
gandha
baba
perfume
saint
who
is
gracing
yonder
house
he
pointed
to
a
dwelling
a
few
yards
distant
do
meet
him
he
is
interesting
you
may
have
an
unusual
experience
and
he
actually
left
me
the
similarly
worded
prediction
of
the
sadhu
at
kalighat
temple
flashed
to
my
mind
definitely
intrigued
i
entered
the
house
and
was
ushered
into
a
commodious
parlor
a
crowd
of
people
were
sitting
here
and
there
on
a
thick
carpet
an
awed
whisper
reached
my
ear
behold
gandha
baba
on
the
leopard
skin
he
can
give
the
natural
perfume
of
any
flower
to
a
scentless
one
or
revive
a
wilted
blossom
or
make
a
person
skin
exude
delightful
fragrance
i
looked
directly
at
the
saint
his
quick
gaze
rested
on
mine
he
was
plump
and
bearded
with
dark
skin
and
large
gleaming
eyes
son
i
am
glad
to
see
you
say
what
you
want
would
you
like
some
perfume
what
for
i
thought
his
remark
rather
childish
to
experience
the
miraculous
way
of
enjoying
perfumes
harnessing
god
to
make
odors
what
of
it
god
makes
perfume
anyway
yes
but
he
fashions
frail
bottles
of
petals
for
fresh
use
and
discard
can
you
materialize
flowers
i
materialize
perfumes
little
friend
then
scent
factories
will
go
out
of
business
i
will
permit
them
to
keep
their
trade
my
own
purpose
is
to
demonstrate
the
power
of
god
sir
is
it
necessary
to
prove
god
is
he
performing
miracles
in
everything
everywhere
yes
but
we
too
should
manifest
some
of
his
infinite
creative
variety
how
long
did
it
take
to
master
your
art
twelve
years
for
manufacturing
scents
by
astral
means
it
seems
my
honored
saint
you
have
been
wasting
a
dozen
years
for
fragrances
which
you
can
obtain
with
a
few
rupees
from
a
florist
shop
perfumes
fade
with
flowers
perfumes
fade
with
death
why
should
i
desire
that
which
pleases
the
body
only
philosopher
you
please
my
mind
now
stretch
forth
your
right
hand
he
made
a
gesture
of
blessing
i
was
a
few
feet
away
from
gandha
baba
no
one
else
was
near
enough
to
contact
my
body
i
extended
my
hand
which
the
yogi
did
not
touch
what
perfume
do
you
want
rose
be
it
so
to
my
great
surprise
the
charming
fragrance
of
rose
was
wafted
strongly
from
the
center
of
my
palm
i
smilingly
took
a
large
white
scentless
flower
from
a
vase
can
this
odorless
blossom
be
permeated
with
jasmine
be
it
so
a
jasmine
fragrance
instantly
shot
from
the
petals
i
thanked
the
and
seated
myself
by
one
of
his
students
he
informed
me
that
gandha
baba
whose
proper
name
was
vishudhananda
had
learned
many
astonishing
yoga
secrets
from
a
master
in
tibet
the
tibetan
yogi
i
was
assured
had
attained
the
age
of
over
a
thousand
years
his
disciple
gandha
baba
does
not
always
perform
his
in
the
simple
verbal
manner
you
have
just
witnessed
the
student
spoke
with
obvious
pride
in
his
master
his
procedure
differs
widely
to
accord
with
diversity
in
temperaments
he
is
marvelous
many
members
of
the
calcutta
intelligentsia
are
among
his
followers
i
inwardly
resolved
not
to
add
myself
to
their
number
a
guru
too
literally
marvelous
was
not
to
my
liking
with
polite
thanks
to
gandha
baba
i
departed
sauntering
home
i
reflected
on
the
three
varied
encounters
the
day
had
brought
forth
my
sister
uma
met
me
as
i
entered
our
gurpar
road
door
you
are
getting
quite
stylish
using
perfumes
without
a
word
i
motioned
her
to
smell
my
hand
what
an
attractive
rose
fragrance
it
is
unusually
strong
thinking
it
was
strongly
unusual
i
silently
placed
the
astrally
scented
blossom
under
her
nostrils
oh
i
love
jasmine
she
seized
the
flower
a
ludicrous
bafflement
passed
over
her
face
as
she
repeatedly
sniffed
the
odor
of
jasmine
from
a
type
of
flower
she
well
knew
to
be
scentless
her
reactions
disarmed
my
suspicion
that
gandha
baba
had
induced
an
state
whereby
i
alone
could
detect
the
fragrances
later
i
heard
from
a
friend
alakananda
that
the
perfume
saint
had
a
power
which
i
wish
were
possessed
by
the
starving
millions
of
asia
and
today
of
europe
as
well
i
was
present
with
a
hundred
other
guests
at
gandha
baba
home
in
burdwan
alakananda
told
me
it
was
a
gala
occasion
because
the
yogi
was
reputed
to
have
the
power
of
extracting
objects
out
of
thin
air
i
laughingly
requested
him
to
materialize
some
tangerines
immediately
the
luchis
which
were
present
on
all
the
plates
became
puffed
up
each
of
the
proved
to
contain
a
peeled
tangerine
i
bit
into
my
own
with
some
trepidation
but
found
it
delicious
years
later
i
understood
by
inner
realization
how
gandha
baba
accomplished
his
materializations
the
method
alas
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
world
hungry
hordes
the
different
sensory
stimuli
to
which
man
visual
gustatory
auditory
and
produced
by
vibratory
variations
in
electrons
and
protons
the
vibrations
in
turn
are
regulated
by
lifetrons
subtle
life
forces
or
energies
intelligently
charged
with
the
five
distinctive
sensory
gandha
baba
tuning
himself
with
the
cosmic
force
by
certain
yogic
practices
was
able
to
guide
the
lifetrons
to
rearrange
their
vibratory
structure
and
objectivize
the
desired
result
his
perfume
fruit
and
other
miracles
were
actual
materializations
of
mundane
vibrations
and
not
inner
sensations
hypnotically
produced
performances
of
miracles
such
as
shown
by
the
perfume
saint
are
spectacular
but
spiritually
useless
having
little
purpose
beyond
entertainment
they
are
digressions
from
a
serious
search
for
god
hypnotism
has
been
used
by
physicians
in
minor
operations
as
a
sort
of
psychical
chloroform
for
persons
who
might
be
endangered
by
an
anesthetic
but
a
hypnotic
state
is
harmful
to
those
often
subjected
to
it
a
negative
psychological
effect
ensues
which
in
time
deranges
the
brain
cells
hypnotism
is
trespass
into
the
territory
of
another
consciousness
its
temporary
phenomena
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
miracles
performed
by
men
of
divine
realization
awake
in
god
true
saints
effect
changes
in
this
by
means
of
a
will
harmoniously
attuned
to
the
creative
cosmic
dreamer
ostentatious
display
of
unusual
powers
are
decried
by
masters
the
persian
mystic
abu
said
once
laughed
at
certain
fakirs
who
were
proud
of
their
miraculous
powers
over
water
air
and
space
a
frog
is
also
at
home
in
the
water
abu
said
pointed
out
in
gentle
scorn
the
crow
and
the
vulture
easily
fly
in
the
air
the
devil
is
simultaneously
present
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
a
true
man
is
he
who
dwells
in
righteousness
among
his
fellow
men
who
buys
and
sells
yet
is
never
for
a
single
instant
forgetful
of
god
on
another
occasion
the
great
persian
teacher
gave
his
views
on
the
religious
life
thus
to
lay
aside
what
you
have
in
your
head
selfish
desires
and
ambitions
to
freely
bestow
what
you
have
in
your
hand
and
never
to
flinch
from
the
blows
of
adversity
neither
the
impartial
sage
at
kalighat
temple
nor
the
yogi
had
satisfied
my
yearning
for
a
guru
my
heart
needed
no
tutor
for
its
recognitions
and
cried
its
own
bravos
the
more
resoundingly
because
unoften
summoned
from
silence
when
i
finally
met
my
master
he
taught
me
by
sublimity
of
example
alone
the
measure
of
a
true
man
kali
represents
the
eternal
principle
in
nature
she
is
traditionally
pictured
as
a
woman
standing
on
the
form
of
the
god
shiva
or
the
infinite
because
nature
or
the
phenomenal
world
is
rooted
in
the
noumenon
the
four
arms
symbolize
cardinal
attributes
two
beneficent
two
destructive
indicating
the
essential
duality
of

or

cosmic

literally
the
measurer

is
the
magical
power
in

by
which
limitations
and
divisions
are
apparently
present
in
the
immeasurable
and
inseparable
emerson
wrote
the
following

to
which
he
gave
the
title
of

impenetrable
weaving

innumerable
her
gay
pictures
never
fail
crowd
each
other
veil
on
veil
charmer
who
will
be
believed
by
man
who
thirsts
to
be
deceived
the
rishis
literally
seers
were
the
authors
of
the
vedas
in
an
indeterminable
flat
round
indian
laymen
scarcely
realize
the
vast
strides
of
science
transmutation
of
metals
and
other
alchemical
dreams
are
seeing
fulfillment
every
day
in
centers
of
scientific
research
over
the
world
the
eminent
french
chemist
georges
claude
performed
miracles
at
fontainebleau
in
before
a
scientific
assemblage
through
his
chemical
knowledge
of
oxygen
transformations
his
magician
wand
was
simple
oxygen
bubbling
in
a
tube
on
a
table
the
scientist
turned
a
handful
of
sand
into
precious
stones
iron
into
a
state
resembling
melted
chocolate
and
after
depriving
flowers
of
their
tints
turned
them
into
the
consistency
of
glass
claude
explained
how
the
sea
could
be
turned
by
oxygen
transformations
into
many
millions
of
pounds
of
horsepower
how
water
which
boils
is
not
necessarily
burning
how
little
mounds
of
sand
by
a
single
whiff
of
the
oxygen
blowpipe
could
be
changed
into
sapphires
rubies
and
topazes
and
he
predicted
the
time
when
it
will
be
possible
for
men
to
walk
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
minus
the
diver
equipment
finally
the
scientist
amazed
his
onlookers
by
turning
their
faces
black
by
taking
the
red
out
of
the
rays
this
noted
french
scientist
has
produced
liquid
air
by
an
expansion
method
in
which
he
has
been
able
to
separate
the
various
gases
of
the
air
and
has
discovered
various
means
of
mechanical
utilization
of
differences
of

chapter
the
tiger
swami
i
have
discovered
the
tiger
swami
address
let
us
visit
him
tomorrow
this
welcome
suggestion
came
from
chandi
one
of
my
high
school
friends
i
was
eager
to
meet
the
saint
who
in
his
premonastic
life
had
caught
and
fought
tigers
with
his
naked
hands
a
boyish
enthusiasm
over
such
remarkable
feats
was
strong
within
me
the
next
day
dawned
wintry
cold
but
chandi
and
i
sallied
forth
gaily
after
much
vain
hunting
in
bhowanipur
outside
calcutta
we
arrived
at
the
right
house
the
door
held
two
iron
rings
which
i
sounded
piercingly
notwithstanding
the
clamor
a
servant
approached
with
leisurely
gait
his
ironical
smile
implied
that
visitors
despite
their
noise
were
powerless
to
disturb
the
calmness
of
a
saint
home
feeling
the
silent
rebuke
my
companion
and
i
were
thankful
to
be
invited
into
the
parlor
our
long
wait
there
caused
uncomfortable
misgivings
india
unwritten
law
for
the
truth
seeker
is
patience
a
master
may
purposely
make
a
test
of
one
eagerness
to
meet
him
this
psychological
ruse
is
freely
employed
in
the
west
by
doctors
and
dentists
finally
summoned
by
the
servant
chandi
and
i
entered
a
sleeping
apartment
the
famous
sohong
swami
was
seated
on
his
bed
the
sight
of
his
tremendous
body
affected
us
strangely
with
bulging
eyes
we
stood
speechless
we
had
never
before
seen
such
a
chest
or
such
biceps
on
an
immense
neck
the
swami
fierce
yet
calm
face
was
adorned
with
flowing
locks
beard
and
moustache
a
hint
of
dovelike
and
tigerlike
qualities
shone
in
his
dark
eyes
he
was
unclothed
save
for
a
tiger
skin
about
his
muscular
waist
finding
our
voices
my
friend
and
i
greeted
the
monk
expressing
our
admiration
for
his
prowess
in
the
extraordinary
feline
arena
will
you
not
tell
us
please
how
it
is
possible
to
subdue
with
bare
fists
the
most
ferocious
of
jungle
beasts
the
royal
bengals
my
sons
it
is
nothing
to
me
to
fight
tigers
i
could
do
it
today
if
necessary
he
gave
a
childlike
laugh
you
look
upon
tigers
as
tigers
i
know
them
as
pussycats
swamiji
i
think
i
could
impress
my
subconsciousness
with
the
thought
that
tigers
are
pussycats
but
could
i
make
tigers
believe
it
of
course
strength
also
is
necessary
one
can
not
expect
victory
from
a
baby
who
imagines
a
tiger
to
be
a
house
cat
powerful
hands
are
my
sufficient
weapon
he
asked
us
to
follow
him
to
the
patio
where
he
struck
the
edge
of
a
wall
a
brick
crashed
to
the
floor
the
sky
peered
boldly
through
the
gaping
lost
tooth
of
the
wall
i
fairly
staggered
in
astonishment
he
who
can
remove
mortared
bricks
from
a
solid
wall
with
one
blow
i
thought
must
surely
be
able
to
displace
the
teeth
of
tigers
a
number
of
men
have
physical
power
such
as
mine
but
still
lack
in
cool
confidence
those
who
are
bodily
but
not
mentally
stalwart
may
find
themselves
fainting
at
mere
sight
of
a
wild
beast
bounding
freely
in
the
jungle
the
tiger
in
its
natural
ferocity
and
habitat
is
vastly
different
from
the
circus
animal
many
a
man
with
herculean
strength
has
nonetheless
been
terrorized
into
abject
helplessness
before
the
onslaught
of
a
royal
bengal
thus
the
tiger
has
converted
the
man
in
his
own
mind
to
a
state
as
nerveless
as
the
pussycat
it
is
possible
for
a
man
owning
a
fairly
strong
body
and
an
immensely
strong
determination
to
turn
the
tables
on
the
tiger
and
force
it
to
a
conviction
of
pussycat
defenselessness
how
often
i
have
done
just
that
i
was
quite
willing
to
believe
that
the
titan
before
me
was
able
to
perform
the
metamorphosis
he
seemed
in
a
didactic
mood
chandi
and
i
listened
respectfully
mind
is
the
wielder
of
muscles
the
force
of
a
hammer
blow
depends
on
the
energy
applied
the
power
expressed
by
a
man
bodily
instrument
depends
on
his
aggressive
will
and
courage
the
body
is
literally
manufactured
and
sustained
by
mind
through
pressure
of
instincts
from
past
lives
strengths
or
weaknesses
percolate
gradually
into
human
consciousness
they
express
as
habits
which
in
turn
ossify
into
a
desirable
or
an
undesirable
body
outward
frailty
has
mental
origin
in
a
vicious
circle
the
body
thwarts
the
mind
if
the
master
allows
himself
to
be
commanded
by
a
servant
the
latter
becomes
autocratic
the
mind
is
similarly
enslaved
by
submitting
to
bodily
dictation
at
our
entreaty
the
impressive
swami
consented
to
tell
us
something
of
his
own
life
my
earliest
ambition
was
to
fight
tigers
my
will
was
mighty
but
my
body
was
feeble
an
ejaculation
of
surprise
broke
from
me
it
appeared
incredible
that
this
man
now
with
atlantean
shoulders
fit
to
bear
could
ever
have
known
weakness
it
was
by
indomitable
persistency
in
thoughts
of
health
and
strength
that
i
overcame
my
handicap
i
have
every
reason
to
extol
the
compelling
mental
vigor
which
i
found
to
be
the
real
subduer
of
royal
bengals
do
you
think
revered
swami
that
i
could
ever
fight
tigers
this
was
the
first
and
the
last
time
that
the
bizarre
ambition
ever
visited
my
mind
yes
he
was
smiling
but
there
are
many
kinds
of
tigers
some
roam
in
jungles
of
human
desires
no
spiritual
benefit
accrues
by
knocking
beasts
unconscious
rather
be
victor
over
the
inner
prowlers
may
we
hear
sir
how
you
changed
from
a
tamer
of
wild
tigers
to
a
tamer
of
wild
passions
the
tiger
swami
fell
into
silence
remoteness
came
into
his
gaze
summoning
visions
of
bygone
years
i
discerned
his
slight
mental
struggle
to
decide
whether
to
grant
my
request
finally
he
smiled
in
acquiescence
when
my
fame
reached
a
zenith
it
brought
the
intoxication
of
pride
i
decided
not
only
to
fight
tigers
but
to
display
them
in
various
tricks
my
ambition
was
to
force
savage
beasts
to
behave
like
domesticated
ones
i
began
to
perform
my
feats
publicly
with
gratifying
success
one
evening
my
father
entered
my
room
in
pensive
mood
i
have
words
of
warning
i
would
save
you
from
coming
ills
produced
by
the
grinding
wheels
of
cause
and
effect
you
a
fatalist
father
should
superstition
be
allowed
to
discolor
the
powerful
waters
or
my
activities
am
no
fatalist
son
but
i
believe
in
the
just
law
of
retribution
as
taught
in
the
holy
scriptures
there
is
resentment
against
you
in
the
jungle
family
sometime
it
may
act
to
your
cost
you
astonish
me
you
well
know
what
tigers
but
merciless
even
immediately
after
an
enormous
meal
of
some
hapless
creature
a
tiger
is
fired
with
fresh
lust
at
sight
of
new
prey
it
may
be
a
joyous
gazelle
frisking
over
the
jungle
grass
capturing
it
and
biting
an
opening
in
the
soft
throat
the
malevolent
beast
tastes
only
a
little
of
the
mutely
crying
blood
and
goes
its
wanton
way
are
the
most
contemptible
of
the
jungle
breed
who
knows
my
blows
may
inject
some
slight
sanity
of
consideration
into
their
thick
heads
i
am
headmaster
in
a
forest
finishing
school
to
teach
them
gentle
manners
father
think
of
me
as
tiger
tamer
and
never
as
tiger
killer
how
could
my
good
actions
bring
ill
upon
me
i
beg
you
not
to
impose
any
command
that
i
change
my
way
of
life
chandi
and
i
were
all
attention
understanding
the
past
dilemma
in
india
a
child
does
not
lightly
disobey
his
parents
wishes
in
stoic
silence
father
listened
to
my
explanation
he
followed
it
with
a
disclosure
which
he
uttered
gravely
you
compel
me
to
relate
an
ominous
prediction
from
the
lips
of
a
saint
he
approached
me
yesterday
as
i
sat
on
the
veranda
in
my
daily
meditation
dear
friend
i
come
with
a
message
for
your
belligerent
son
let
him
cease
his
savage
activities
otherwise
his
next
shall
result
in
his
severe
wounds
followed
by
six
months
of
deathly
sickness
he
shall
then
forsake
his
former
ways
and
become
a
monk
this
tale
did
not
impress
me
i
considered
that
father
had
been
the
credulous
victim
of
a
deluded
fanatic
the
tiger
swami
made
this
confession
with
an
impatient
gesture
as
though
at
some
stupidity
grimly
silent
for
a
long
time
he
seemed
oblivious
of
our
presence
when
he
took
up
the
dangling
thread
of
his
narrative
it
was
suddenly
with
subdued
voice
not
long
after
father
warning
i
visited
the
capital
city
of
cooch
behar
the
picturesque
territory
was
new
to
me
and
i
expected
a
restful
change
as
usual
everywhere
a
curious
crowd
followed
me
on
the
streets
i
would
catch
bits
of
whispered
comment
is
the
man
who
fights
wild
tigers
he
legs
or
at
his
face
he
must
be
an
incarnation
of
the
king
of
tigers
himself
you
know
how
village
urchins
function
like
final
editions
of
a
newspaper
with
what
speed
do
the
of
the
women
circulate
from
house
to
house
within
a
few
hours
the
whole
city
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
over
my
presence
i
was
relaxing
quietly
in
the
evening
when
i
heard
the
hoofbeats
of
galloping
horses
they
stopped
in
front
of
my
dwelling
place
in
came
a
number
of
tall
turbaned
policemen
i
was
taken
aback
things
are
possible
unto
these
creatures
of
human
law
i
thought
wonder
if
they
are
going
to
take
me
to
task
about
matters
utterly
unknown
to
me
but
the
officers
bowed
with
unwonted
courtesy
sir
we
are
sent
to
welcome
you
on
behalf
of
the
prince
of
cooch
behar
he
is
pleased
to
invite
you
to
his
palace
tomorrow
morning
i
speculated
awhile
on
the
prospect
for
some
obscure
reason
i
felt
sharp
regret
at
this
interruption
in
my
quiet
trip
but
the
suppliant
manner
of
the
policemen
moved
me
i
agreed
to
go
i
was
bewildered
the
next
day
to
be
obsequiously
escorted
from
my
door
into
a
magnificent
coach
drawn
by
four
horses
a
servant
held
an
ornate
umbrella
to
protect
me
from
the
scorching
sunlight
i
enjoyed
the
pleasant
ride
through
the
city
and
its
woodland
outskirts
the
royal
scion
himself
was
at
the
palace
door
to
welcome
me
he
proffered
his
own
seat
smilingly
placing
himself
in
a
chair
of
simpler
design
this
politeness
is
certainly
going
to
cost
me
something
i
thought
in
mounting
astonishment
the
prince
motive
emerged
after
a
few
casual
remarks
city
is
filled
with
the
rumor
that
you
can
fight
wild
tigers
with
nothing
more
than
your
naked
hands
is
it
a
fact
is
quite
true
can
scarcely
believe
it
you
are
a
calcutta
bengali
nurtured
on
the
white
rice
of
city
folk
be
frank
please
have
you
not
been
fighting
only
spineless
animals
his
voice
was
loud
and
sarcastic
tinged
with
provincial
accent
i
vouchsafed
no
reply
to
his
insulting
question
challenge
you
to
fight
my
tiger
raja
begum
if
you
can
successfully
resist
him
bind
him
with
a
chain
and
leave
his
cage
in
a
conscious
state
you
shall
have
this
royal
bengal
several
thousand
rupees
and
many
other
gifts
shall
also
be
bestowed
if
you
refuse
to
meet
him
in
combat
i
shall
blazon
your
name
throughout
the
state
as
an
impostor
his
insolent
words
struck
me
like
a
volley
of
bullets
i
shot
an
angry
acceptance
half
risen
from
the
chair
in
his
excitement
the
prince
sank
back
with
a
sadistic
smile
i
was
reminded
of
the
roman
emperors
who
delighted
in
setting
christians
in
bestial
arenas
match
will
be
set
for
a
week
hence
i
regret
that
i
can
not
give
you
permission
to
view
the
tiger
in
advance
whether
the
prince
feared
i
might
seek
to
hypnotize
the
beast
or
secretly
feed
him
opium
i
know
not
i
left
the
palace
noting
with
amusement
that
the
royal
umbrella
and
panoplied
coach
were
now
missing
the
following
week
i
methodically
prepared
my
mind
and
body
for
the
coming
ordeal
through
my
servant
i
learned
of
fantastic
tales
the
saint
direful
prediction
to
my
father
had
somehow
got
abroad
enlarging
as
it
ran
many
simple
villagers
believed
that
an
evil
spirit
cursed
by
the
gods
had
reincarnated
as
a
tiger
which
took
various
demoniac
forms
at
night
but
remained
a
striped
animal
during
the
day
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
one
sent
to
humble
me
another
imaginative
version
was
that
animal
prayers
to
tiger
heaven
had
achieved
a
response
in
the
shape
of
raja
begum
he
was
to
be
the
instrument
to
punish
audacious
biped
so
insulting
to
the
entire
tiger
species
a
furless
fangless
man
daring
to
challenge
a
tiger
the
concentrated
venom
of
all
humiliated
villagers
gathered
momentum
sufficient
to
operate
hidden
laws
and
bring
about
the
fall
of
the
proud
tiger
tamer
my
servant
further
apprized
me
that
the
prince
was
in
his
element
as
manager
of
the
bout
between
man
and
beast
he
had
supervised
the
erection
of
a
pavilion
designed
to
accommodate
thousands
its
center
held
raja
begum
in
an
enormous
iron
cage
surrounded
by
an
outer
safety
room
the
captive
emitted
a
ceaseless
series
of
roars
he
was
fed
sparingly
to
kindle
a
wrathful
appetite
perhaps
the
prince
expected
me
to
be
the
meal
of
reward
crowds
from
the
city
and
suburbs
bought
tickets
eagerly
in
response
to
the
beat
of
drums
announcing
the
unique
contest
the
day
of
battle
saw
hundreds
turned
away
for
lack
of
seats
many
men
broke
through
the
tent
openings
or
crowded
any
space
below
the
galleries
as
the
tiger
swami
story
approached
a
climax
my
excitement
mounted
with
it
chandi
also
was
raptly
mute
amidst
piercing
from
raja
begum
and
the
hubbub
of
the
somewhat
terrified
crowd
i
quietly
made
my
appearance
scantily
clad
around
the
waist
i
was
otherwise
unprotected
by
clothing
i
opened
the
bolt
on
the
door
of
the
safety
room
and
calmly
locked
it
behind
me
the
tiger
sensed
blood
leaping
with
a
thunderous
crash
on
his
bars
he
sent
forth
a
fearsome
welcome
the
audience
was
hushed
with
pitiful
fear
i
seemed
a
meek
lamb
before
the
raging
beast
in
a
trice
i
was
within
the
cage
but
as
i
slammed
the
door
raja
begum
was
headlong
upon
me
my
right
hand
was
desperately
torn
human
blood
the
greatest
treat
a
tiger
can
know
fell
in
appalling
streams
the
prophecy
of
the
saint
seemed
about
to
be
fulfilled
i
rallied
instantly
from
the
shock
of
the
first
serious
injury
i
had
ever
received
banishing
the
sight
of
my
gory
fingers
by
thrusting
them
beneath
my
waist
cloth
i
swung
my
left
arm
in
a
blow
the
beast
reeled
back
swirled
around
the
rear
of
the
cage
and
sprang
forward
convulsively
my
famous
fistic
punishment
rained
on
his
head
but
raja
begum
taste
of
blood
had
acted
like
the
maddening
first
sip
of
wine
to
a
dipsomaniac
punctuated
by
deafening
roar
the
brute
assaults
grew
in
fury
my
inadequate
defense
of
only
one
hand
left
me
vulnerable
before
claws
and
fangs
but
i
dealt
out
dazing
retribution
mutually
ensanguined
we
struggled
as
to
the
death
the
cage
was
pandemonium
as
blood
splashed
in
all
directions
and
blasts
of
pain
and
lethal
lust
came
from
the
bestial
throat
him
the
tiger
shrieks
arose
from
the
audience
so
fast
did
man
and
beast
move
that
a
guard
bullet
went
amiss
i
mustered
all
my
will
force
bellowed
fiercely
and
landed
a
final
concussive
blow
the
tiger
collapsed
and
lay
quietly
like
a
pussycat
i
interjected
the
swami
laughed
in
hearty
appreciation
then
continued
the
engrossing
tale
raja
begum
was
vanquished
at
last
his
royal
pride
was
further
humbled
with
my
lacerated
hands
i
audaciously
forced
open
his
jaws
for
a
dramatic
moment
i
held
my
head
within
the
yawning
deathtrap
i
looked
around
for
a
chain
pulling
one
from
a
pile
on
the
floor
i
bound
the
tiger
by
his
neck
to
the
cage
bars
in
triumph
i
moved
toward
the
door
but
that
fiend
incarnate
raja
begum
had
stamina
worthy
of
his
supposed
demoniac
origin
with
an
incredible
lunge
he
snapped
the
chain
and
leaped
on
my
back
my
shoulder
fast
in
his
jaws
i
fell
violently
but
in
a
trice
i
had
him
pinned
beneath
me
under
merciless
blows
the
treacherous
animal
sank
into
semiconsciousness
this
time
i
secured
him
more
carefully
slowly
i
left
the
cage
i
found
myself
in
a
new
uproar
this
time
one
of
delight
the
cheer
broke
as
though
from
a
single
gigantic
throat
disastrously
mauled
i
had
yet
fulfilled
the
three
conditions
of
the
the
tiger
binding
him
with
a
chain
and
leaving
him
without
requiring
assistance
for
myself
in
addition
i
had
so
drastically
injured
and
frightened
the
aggressive
beast
that
he
had
been
content
to
overlook
the
opportune
prize
of
my
head
in
his
mouth
after
my
wounds
were
treated
i
was
honored
and
garlanded
hundreds
of
gold
pieces
showered
at
my
feet
the
whole
city
entered
a
holiday
period
endless
discussions
were
heard
on
all
sides
about
my
victory
over
one
of
the
largest
and
most
savage
tigers
ever
seen
raja
begum
was
presented
to
me
as
promised
but
i
felt
no
elation
a
spiritual
change
had
entered
my
heart
it
seemed
that
with
my
final
exit
from
the
cage
i
had
also
closed
the
door
on
my
worldly
ambitions
a
woeful
period
followed
for
six
months
i
lay
near
death
from
blood
poisoning
as
soon
as
i
was
well
enough
to
leave
cooch
behar
i
returned
to
my
native
town
know
now
that
my
teacher
is
the
holy
man
who
gave
the
wise
warning
i
humbly
made
this
confession
to
my
father
if
i
could
only
find
him
my
longing
was
sincere
for
one
day
the
saint
arrived
unheralded
of
tiger
taming
he
spoke
with
calm
assurance
with
me
i
will
teach
you
to
subdue
the
beasts
of
ignorance
roaming
in
jungles
of
the
human
mind
you
are
used
to
an
audience
let
it
be
a
galaxy
of
angels
entertained
by
your
thrilling
mastery
of
yoga
i
was
initiated
into
the
spiritual
path
by
my
saintly
guru
he
opened
my
rusty
and
resistant
with
long
disuse
hand
in
hand
we
soon
set
out
for
my
training
in
the
himalayas
chandi
and
i
bowed
at
the
swami
feet
grateful
for
his
vivid
outline
of
a
life
truly
cyclonic
i
felt
amply
repaid
for
the
long
probationary
wait
in
the
cold
parlor
sohong
was
his
monastic
name
he
was
popularly
known
as
the
tiger
swami
prince
princess
named
to
indicate
that
this
beast
possessed
the
combined
ferocity
of
tiger
and
tigress
chapter
the
levitating
saint
i
saw
a
yogi
remain
in
the
air
several
feet
above
the
ground
last
night
at
a
group
meeting
my
friend
upendra
mohun
chowdhury
spoke
impressively
i
gave
him
an
enthusiastic
smile
perhaps
i
can
guess
his
name
was
it
bhaduri
mahasaya
of
upper
circular
road
upendra
nodded
a
little
crestfallen
not
to
be
a
my
inquisitiveness
about
saints
was
among
my
friends
they
delighted
in
setting
me
on
a
fresh
track
the
yogi
lives
so
close
to
my
home
that
i
often
visit
him
my
words
brought
keen
interest
to
upendra
face
and
i
made
a
further
confidence
i
have
seen
him
in
remarkable
feats
he
has
expertly
mastered
the
various
pranayamas
of
the
ancient
eightfold
yoga
outlined
by
patanjali
once
bhaduri
mahasaya
performed
the
bhastrika
pranayama
before
me
with
such
amazing
force
that
it
seemed
an
actual
storm
had
arisen
in
the
room
then
he
extinguished
the
thundering
breath
and
remained
motionless
in
a
high
state
of
superconsciousness
the
aura
of
peace
after
the
storm
was
vivid
beyond
forgetting
i
heard
that
the
saint
never
leaves
his
home
upendra
tone
was
a
trifle
incredulous
indeed
it
is
true
he
has
lived
indoors
for
the
past
twenty
years
he
slightly
relaxes
his
rule
at
the
times
of
our
holy
festivals
when
he
goes
as
far
as
his
front
sidewalk
the
beggars
gather
there
because
saint
bhaduri
is
known
for
his
tender
heart
how
does
he
remain
in
the
air
defying
the
law
of
gravitation
a
yogi
body
loses
its
grossness
after
use
of
certain
pranayamas
then
it
will
levitate
or
hop
about
like
a
leaping
frog
even
saints
who
do
not
practice
a
formal
yoga
have
been
known
to
levitate
during
a
state
of
intense
devotion
to
god
i
would
like
to
know
more
of
this
sage
do
you
attend
his
evening
meetings
upendra
eyes
were
sparkling
with
curiosity
yes
i
go
often
i
am
vastly
entertained
by
the
wit
in
his
wisdom
occasionally
my
prolonged
laughter
mars
the
solemnity
of
his
gatherings
the
saint
is
not
displeased
but
his
disciples
look
daggers
on
my
way
home
from
school
that
afternoon
i
passed
bhaduri
cloister
and
decided
on
a
visit
the
yogi
was
inaccessible
to
the
general
public
a
lone
disciple
occupying
the
ground
floor
guarded
his
master
privacy
the
student
was
something
of
a
martinet
he
now
inquired
formally
if
i
had
an
engagement
his
guru
put
in
an
appearance
just
in
time
to
save
me
from
summary
ejection
let
mukunda
come
when
he
will
the
sage
eyes
twinkled
my
rule
of
seclusion
is
not
for
my
own
comfort
but
for
that
of
others
worldly
people
do
not
like
the
candor
which
shatters
their
delusions
saints
are
not
only
rare
but
disconcerting
even
in
scripture
they
are
often
found
embarrassing
i
followed
bhaduri
mahasaya
to
his
austere
quarters
on
the
top
floor
from
which
he
seldom
stirred
masters
often
ignore
the
panorama
of
the
world
ado
out
of
focus
till
centered
in
the
ages
the
contemporaries
of
a
sage
are
not
alone
those
of
the
narrow
present
maharishi
you
are
the
first
yogi
i
have
known
who
always
stays
indoors
god
plants
his
saints
sometimes
in
unexpected
soil
lest
we
think
we
may
reduce
him
to
a
rule
the
sage
locked
his
vibrant
body
in
the
lotus
posture
in
his
seventies
he
displayed
no
unpleasing
signs
of
age
or
sedentary
life
stalwart
and
straight
he
was
ideal
in
every
respect
his
face
was
that
of
a
rishi
as
described
in
the
ancient
texts
abundantly
bearded
he
always
sat
firmly
upright
his
quiet
eyes
fixed
on
omnipresence
the
saint
and
i
entered
the
meditative
state
after
an
hour
his
gentle
voice
roused
me
you
go
often
into
the
silence
but
have
you
developed
anubhava
he
was
reminding
me
to
love
god
more
than
meditation
do
not
mistake
the
technique
for
the
goal
he
offered
me
some
mangoes
with
that
wit
that
i
found
so
delightful
in
his
grave
nature
he
remarked
people
in
general
are
more
fond
of
jala
yoga
union
with
food
than
of
dhyana
yoga
union
with
god
his
yogic
pun
affected
me
uproariously
what
a
laugh
you
have
an
affectionate
gleam
came
into
his
gaze
his
own
face
was
always
serious
yet
touched
with
an
ecstatic
smile
his
large
lotus
eyes
held
a
hidden
divine
laughter
those
letters
come
from
america
the
sage
indicated
several
thick
envelopes
on
a
table
i
correspond
with
a
few
societies
there
whose
members
are
interested
in
yoga
they
are
discovering
india
anew
with
a
better
sense
of
direction
than
columbus
i
am
glad
to
help
them
the
knowledge
of
yoga
is
free
to
all
who
will
receive
like
the
ungarnishable
daylight
what
rishis
perceived
as
essential
for
human
salvation
need
not
be
diluted
for
the
west
alike
in
soul
though
diverse
in
outer
experience
neither
west
nor
east
will
flourish
if
some
form
of
disciplinary
yoga
be
not
practiced
the
saint
held
me
with
his
tranquil
eyes
i
did
not
realize
that
his
speech
was
a
veiled
prophetic
guidance
it
is
only
now
as
i
write
these
words
that
i
understand
the
full
meaning
in
the
casual
intimations
he
often
gave
me
that
someday
i
would
carry
teachings
to
america

wit
put
me
into
another
gale
of
laughter
i
remained
alone
with
the
yogi
until
his
disciples
arrived
in
the
evening
bhaduri
mahasaya
entered
one
of
his
inimitable
discourses
like
a
peaceful
flood
he
swept
away
the
mental
debris
of
his
listeners
floating
them
godward
his
striking
parables
were
expressed
in
a
flawless
bengali
this
evening
bhaduri
expounded
various
philosophical
points
connected
with
the
life
of
mirabai
a
medieval
rajputani
princess
who
abandoned
her
court
life
to
seek
the
company
of
sadhus
one
refused
to
receive
her
because
she
was
a
woman
her
reply
brought
him
humbly
to
her
feet
tell
the
master
she
had
said
that
i
did
not
know
there
was
any
male
in
the
universe
save
god
are
we
all
not
females
before
him
a
scriptural
conception
of
the
lord
as
the
only
positive
creative
principle
his
creation
being
naught
but
a
passive
maya
mirabai
composed
many
ecstatic
songs
which
are
still
treasured
in
india
i
translate
one
of
them
here
if
by
bathing
daily
god
could
be
realized
sooner
would
i
be
a
whale
in
the
deep
if
by
eating
roots
and
fruits
he
could
be
known
gladly
would
i
choose
the
form
of
a
goat
if
the
counting
of
rosaries
uncovered
him
i
would
say
my
prayers
on
mammoth
beads
if
bowing
before
stone
images
unveiled
him
a
flinty
mountain
i
would
humbly
worship
if
by
drinking
milk
the
lord
could
be
imbibed
many
calves
and
children
would
know
him
if
abandoning
one
wife
would
summon
god
would
not
thousands
be
eunuchs
mirabai
knows
that
to
find
the
divine
one
the
only
indispensable
is
love
several
students
put
rupees
in
bhaduri
slippers
which
lay
by
his
side
as
he
sat
in
yoga
posture
this
respectful
offering
customary
in
india
indicates
that
the
disciple
places
his
material
goods
at
the
guru
feet
grateful
friends
are
only
the
lord
in
disguise
looking
after
his
own
master
you
are
wonderful
a
student
taking
his
leave
gazed
ardently
at
the
patriarchal
sage
you
have
renounced
riches
and
comforts
to
seek
god
and
teach
us
wisdom
it
was
that
bhaduri
mahasaya
had
forsaken
great
family
wealth
in
his
early
childhood
when
he
entered
the
yogic
path
you
are
reversing
the
case
the
saint
face
held
a
mild
rebuke
i
have
left
a
few
paltry
rupees
a
few
petty
pleasures
for
a
cosmic
empire
of
endless
bliss
how
then
have
i
denied
myself
anything
i
know
the
joy
of
sharing
the
treasure
is
that
a
sacrifice
the
shortsighted
worldly
folk
are
verily
the
real
renunciates
they
relinquish
an
unparalleled
divine
possession
for
a
poor
handful
of
earthly
toys
i
chuckled
over
this
paradoxical
view
of
which
puts
the
cap
of
croesus
on
any
saintly
beggar
whilst
transforming
all
proud
millionaires
into
unconscious
martyrs
the
divine
order
arranges
our
future
more
wisely
than
any
insurance
company
the
master
concluding
words
were
the
realized
creed
of
his
faith
the
world
is
full
of
uneasy
believers
in
an
outward
security
their
bitter
thoughts
are
like
scars
on
their
foreheads
the
one
who
gave
us
air
and
milk
from
our
first
breath
knows
how
to
provide
day
by
day
for
his
devotees
i
continued
my
pilgrimages
to
the
saint
door
with
silent
zeal
he
aided
me
to
attain
anubhava
one
day
he
moved
to
ram
mohan
roy
road
away
from
the
neighborhood
of
my
gurpar
road
home
his
loving
disciples
had
built
him
a
new
hermitage
known
as
nagendra
math
although
it
throws
me
ahead
of
my
story
by
a
number
of
years
i
will
recount
here
the
last
words
given
to
me
by
bhaduri
mahasaya
shortly
before
i
embarked
for
the
west
i
sought
him
out
and
humbly
knelt
for
his
farewell
blessing

french
professors
were
the
first
in
the
west
to
be
willing
to
scientifically
investigate
the
possibilities
of
the
superconscious
mind
professor
member
of
the
de
psychologie
of
the
sorbonne
lectured
in
america
in
he
told
his
audiences
that
french
scientists
have
accorded
recognition
to
the
superconsciousness
which
is
the
exact
opposite
of
freud
subconscious
mind
and
is
the
faculty
which
makes
man
really
man
and
not
just
a
explained
that
the
awakening
of
the
higher
consciousness
was
not
to
be
confused
with
coueism
or
hypnotism
the
existence
of
a
superconscious
mind
has
long
been
recognized
philosophically
being
in
reality
the
oversoul
spoken
of
by
emerson
but
only
recently
has
it
been
recognized
scientifically
the
french
scientist
pointed
out
that
from
the
superconsciousness
come
inspiration
genius
moral
values
belief
in
this
is
not
mysticism

it
recognized

valued

in
joining
them
was
racial
pride
i
regret
it
i
can
not
deny
my
keen
interest
in
evidence
that
india
can
play
a
leading
part
in
physics
and
not
metaphysics
alone
what
do
you
mean
sir
the
professor
obligingly
explained
bose
was
the
first
one
to
invent
a
wireless
coherer
and
an
instrument
for
indicating
the
refraction
of
electric
waves
but
the
indian
scientist
did
not
exploit
his
inventions
commercially
he
soon
turned
his
attention
from
the
inorganic
to
the
organic
world
his
revolutionary
discoveries
as
a
plant
physiologist
are
outpacing
even
his
radical
achievements
as
a
physicist
i
politely
thanked
my
mentor
he
added
the
great
scientist
is
one
of
my
brother
professors
at
presidency
college
i
paid
a
visit
the
next
day
to
the
sage
at
his
home
which
was
close
to
mine
on
gurpar
road
i
had
long
admired
him
from
a
respectful
distance
the
grave
and
retiring
botanist
greeted
me
graciously
he
was
a
handsome
robust
man
in
his
fifties
with
thick
hair
broad
forehead
and
the
abstracted
eyes
of
a
dreamer
the
precision
in
his
tones
revealed
the
lifelong
scientific
habit
i
have
recently
returned
from
an
expedition
to
scientific
societies
of
the
west
their
members
exhibited
intense
interest
in
delicate
instruments
of
my
invention
which
demonstrate
the
indivisible
unity
of
all
life
the
bose
crescograph
has
the
enormity
of
ten
million
magnifications
the
microscope
enlarges
only
a
few
thousand
times
yet
it
brought
vital
impetus
to
biological
science
the
crescograph
opens
incalculable
vistas
you
have
done
much
sir
to
hasten
the
embrace
of
east
and
west
in
the
impersonal
arms
of
science
i
was
educated
at
cambridge
how
admirable
is
the
western
method
of
submitting
all
theory
to
scrupulous
experimental
verification
that
empirical
procedure
has
gone
hand
in
hand
with
the
gift
for
introspection
which
is
my
eastern
heritage
together
they
have
enabled
me
to
sunder
the
silences
of
natural
realms
long
uncommunicative
the
telltale
charts
of
my
crescograph
are
evidence
for
the
most
skeptical
that
plants
have
a
sensitive
nervous
system
and
a
varied
emotional
life
love
hate
joy
fear
pleasure
pain
excitability
stupor
and
countless
appropriate
responses
to
stimuli
are
as
universal
in
plants
as
in
animals
the
unique
throb
of
life
in
all
creation
could
seem
only
poetic
imagery
before
your
advent
professor
a
saint
i
once
knew
would
never
pluck
flowers
i
rob
the
rosebush
of
its
pride
in
beauty
shall
i
cruelly
affront
its
dignity
by
my
rude
divestment
his
sympathetic
words
are
verified
literally
through
your
discoveries
the
poet
is
intimate
with
truth
while
the
scientist
approaches
awkwardly
come
someday
to
my
laboratory
and
see
the
unequivocable
testimony
of
the
crescograph
gratefully
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
took
my
departure
i
heard
later
that
the
botanist
had
left
presidency
college
and
was
planning
a
research
center
in
calcutta
when
the
bose
institute
was
opened
i
attended
the
dedicatory
services
enthusiastic
hundreds
strolled
over
the
premises
i
was
charmed
with
the
artistry
and
spiritual
symbolism
of
the
new
home
of
science
its
front
gate
i
noted
was
a
centuried
relic
from
a
distant
shrine
behind
the
lotus
fountain
a
sculptured
female
figure
with
a
torch
conveyed
the
indian
respect
for
woman
as
the
immortal
the
garden
held
a
small
temple
consecrated
to
the
noumenon
beyond
phenomena
thought
of
the
divine
incorporeity
was
suggested
by
absence
of
any
illustration
myself
at
age
six
see

jagadis
chandra
bose
india
great
physicist
botanist
and
inventor
of
the
crescograph
see
bose
speech
on
this
great
occasion
might
have
issued
from
the
lips
of
one
of
the
inspired
ancient
rishis
i
dedicate
today
this
institute
as
not
merely
a
laboratory
but
a
temple
his
reverent
solemnity
stole
like
an
unseen
cloak
over
the
crowded
auditorium
in
the
pursuit
of
my
investigations
i
was
unconsciously
led
into
the
border
region
of
physics
and
physiology
to
my
amazement
i
found
boundary
lines
vanishing
and
points
of
contact
emerging
between
the
realms
of
the
living
and
the
inorganic
matter
was
perceived
as
anything
but
inert
it
was
athrill
under
the
action
of
multitudinous
forces
a
universal
reaction
seemed
to
bring
metal
plant
and
animal
under
a
common
law
they
all
exhibited
essentially
the
same
phenomena
of
fatigue
and
depression
with
possibilities
of
recovery
and
of
exaltation
as
well
as
the
permanent
irresponsiveness
associated
with
death
filled
with
awe
at
this
stupendous
generalization
it
was
with
great
hope
that
i
announced
my
results
before
the
royal
society
results
demonstrated
by
experiments
but
the
physiologists
present
advised
me
to
confine
myself
to
physical
investigations
in
which
my
success
had
been
assured
rather
than
encroach
on
their
preserves
i
had
unwittingly
strayed
into
the
domain
of
an
unfamiliar
caste
system
and
so
offended
its
etiquette
an
unconscious
theological
bias
was
also
present
which
confounds
ignorance
with
faith
it
is
often
forgotten
that
he
who
surrounded
us
with
this
mystery
of
creation
has
also
implanted
in
us
the
desire
to
question
and
understand
through
many
years
of
miscomprehension
i
came
to
know
that
the
life
of
a
devotee
of
science
is
inevitably
filled
with
unending
struggle
it
is
for
him
to
cast
his
life
as
an
ardent
gain
and
loss
success
and
failure
as
one
in
time
the
leading
scientific
societies
of
the
world
accepted
my
theories
and
results
and
recognized
the
importance
of
the
indian
contribution
to
science
can
anything
small
or
circumscribed
ever
satisfy
the
mind
of
india
by
a
continuous
living
tradition
and
a
vital
power
of
rejuvenescence
this
land
has
readjusted
itself
through
unnumbered
transformations
indians
have
always
arisen
who
discarding
the
immediate
and
absorbing
prize
of
the
hour
have
sought
for
the
realization
of
the
highest
ideals
in
through
passive
renunciation
but
through
active
struggle
the
weakling
who
has
refused
the
conflict
acquiring
nothing
has
had
nothing
to
renounce
he
alone
who
has
striven
and
won
can
enrich
the
world
by
bestowing
the
fruits
of
his
victorious
experience
the
work
already
carried
out
in
the
bose
laboratory
on
the
response
of
matter
and
the
unexpected
revelations
in
plant
life
have
opened
out
very
extended
regions
of
inquiry
in
physics
in
physiology
in
medicine
in
agriculture
and
even
in
psychology
problems
hitherto
regarded
as
insoluble
have
now
been
brought
within
the
sphere
of
experimental
investigation
but
high
success
is
not
to
be
obtained
without
rigid
exactitude
hence
the
long
battery
of
instruments
and
apparatus
of
my
design
which
stand
before
you
today
in
their
cases
in
the
entrance
hall
they
tell
you
of
the
protracted
efforts
to
get
behind
the
deceptive
seeming
into
the
reality
that
remains
unseen
of
the
continuous
toil
and
persistence
and
resourcefulness
called
forth
to
overcome
human
limitations
all
creative
scientists
know
that
the
true
laboratory
is
the
mind
where
behind
illusions
they
uncover
the
laws
of
truth
the
lectures
given
here
will
not
be
mere
repetitions
of
knowledge
they
will
announce
new
discoveries
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
in
these
halls
through
regular
publication
of
the
work
of
the
institute
these
indian
contributions
will
reach
the
whole
world
they
will
become
public
property
no
patents
will
ever
be
taken
the
spirit
of
our
national
culture
demands
that
we
should
forever
be
free
from
the
desecration
of
utilizing
knowledge
only
for
personal
gain
it
is
my
further
wish
that
the
facilities
of
this
institute
be
available
so
far
as
possible
to
workers
from
all
countries
in
this
i
am
attempting
to
carry
on
the
traditions
of
my
country
so
far
back
as
centuries
india
welcomed
to
its
ancient
universities
at
nalanda
and
taxila
scholars
from
all
parts
of
the
world
although
science
is
neither
of
the
east
nor
of
the
west
but
rather
international
in
its
universality
yet
india
is
specially
fitted
to
make
great
contributions
the
burning
indian
imagination
which
can
extort
new
order
out
of
a
mass
of
apparently
contradictory
facts
is
held
in
check
by
the
habit
of
concentration
this
restraint
confers
the
power
to
hold
the
mind
to
the
pursuit
of
truth
with
an
infinite
patience
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
at
the
scientist
concluding
words
is
patience
not
indeed
a
synonym
of
india
confounding
time
and
the
historians
alike
i
visited
the
research
center
again
soon
after
the
day
of
opening
the
great
botanist
mindful
of
his
promise
took
me
to
his
quiet
laboratory
i
will
attach
the
crescograph
to
this
fern
the
magnification
is
tremendous
if
a
snail
crawl
were
enlarged
in
the
same
proportion
the
creature
would
appear
to
be
traveling
like
an
express
train
my
gaze
was
fixed
eagerly
on
the
screen
which
reflected
the
magnified
minute
were
now
clearly
perceptible
the
plant
was
growing
very
slowly
before
my
fascinated
eyes
the
scientist
touched
the
tip
of
the
fern
with
a
small
metal
bar
the
developing
pantomime
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
resuming
the
eloquent
rhythms
as
soon
as
the
rod
was
withdrawn
you
saw
how
any
slight
outside
interference
is
detrimental
to
the
sensitive
tissues
bose
remarked
watch
i
will
now
administer
chloroform
and
then
give
an
antidote
the
effect
of
the
chloroform
discontinued
all
growth
the
antidote
was
revivifying
the
evolutionary
gestures
on
the
screen
held
me
more
raptly
than
a
movie
plot
my
companion
here
in
the
role
of
villain
thrust
a
sharp
instrument
through
a
part
of
the
fern
pain
was
indicated
by
spasmodic
flutters
when
he
passed
a
razor
partially
through
the
stem
the
shadow
was
violently
agitated
then
stilled
itself
with
the
final
punctuation
of
death
by
first
chloroforming
a
huge
tree
i
achieved
a
successful
transplantation
usually
such
monarchs
of
the
forest
die
very
quickly
after
being
moved
jagadis
smiled
happily
as
he
recounted
the
maneuver
graphs
of
my
delicate
apparatus
have
proved
that
trees
possess
a
circulatory
system
their
sap
movements
correspond
to
the
blood
pressure
of
animal
bodies
the
ascent
of
sap
is
not
explicable
on
the
mechanical
grounds
ordinarily
advanced
such
as
capillary
attraction
the
phenomenon
has
been
solved
through
the
crescograph
as
the
activity
of
living
cells
peristaltic
waves
issue
from
a
cylindrical
tube
which
extends
down
a
tree
and
serves
as
an
actual
heart
the
more
deeply
we
perceive
the
more
striking
becomes
the
evidence
that
a
uniform
plan
links
every
form
in
manifold
nature
the
great
scientist
pointed
to
another
bose
instrument
i
will
show
you
experiments
on
a
piece
of
tin
the
in
metals
responds
adversely
or
beneficially
to
stimuli
ink
markings
will
register
the
various
reactions
deeply
engrossed
i
watched
the
graph
which
recorded
the
characteristic
waves
of
atomic
structure
when
the
professor
applied
chloroform
to
the
tin
the
vibratory
writings
stopped
they
recommenced
as
the
metal
slowly
regained
its
normal
state
my
companion
dispensed
a
poisonous
chemical
simultaneous
with
the
quivering
end
of
the
tin
the
needle
dramatically
wrote
on
the
chart
a
bose
instruments
have
demonstrated
that
metals
such
as
the
steel
used
in
scissors
and
machinery
are
subject
to
fatigue
and
regain
efficiency
by
periodic
rest
the
in
metals
is
seriously
harmed
or
even
extinguished
through
the
application
of
electric
currents
or
heavy
pressure
i
looked
around
the
room
at
the
numerous
inventions
eloquent
testimony
of
a
tireless
ingenuity
sir
it
is
lamentable
that
mass
agricultural
development
is
not
speeded
by
fuller
use
of
your
marvelous
mechanisms
would
it
not
be
easily
possible
to
employ
some
of
them
in
quick
laboratory
experiments
to
indicate
the
influence
of
various
types
of
fertilizers
on
plant
growth
you
are
right
countless
uses
of
bose
instruments
will
be
made
by
future
generations
the
scientist
seldom
knows
contemporaneous
reward
it
is
enough
to
possess
the
joy
of
creative
service
with
expressions
of
unreserved
gratitude
to
the
indefatigable
sage
i
took
my
leave
can
the
astonishing
fertility
of
his
genius
ever
be
exhausted
i
thought
no
diminution
came
with
the
years
inventing
an
intricate
instrument
the
resonant
cardiograph
bose
then
pursued
extensive
researches
on
innumerable
indian
plants
an
enormous
unsuspected
pharmacopoeia
of
useful
drugs
was
revealed
the
cardiograph
is
constructed
with
an
unerring
accuracy
by
which
a
part
of
a
second
is
indicated
on
a
graph
resonant
records
measure
infinitesimal
pulsations
in
plant
animal
and
human
structure
the
great
botanist
predicted
that
use
of
his
cardiograph
will
lead
to
vivisection
on
plants
instead
of
animals
side
by
side
recordings
of
the
effects
of
a
medicine
given
simultaneously
to
a
plant
and
an
animal
have
shown
astounding
unanimity
in
result
he
pointed
out
everything
in
man
has
been
foreshadowed
in
the
plant
experimentation
on
vegetation
will
contribute
to
lessening
of
human
suffering
years
later
bose
pioneer
plant
findings
were
substantiated
by
other
scientists
work
done
in
at
columbia
university
was
reported
by
the
new
york
times
as
follows
it
has
been
determined
within
the
past
few
years
that
when
the
nerves
transmit
messages
between
the
brain
and
other
parts
of
the
body
tiny
electrical
impulses
are
being
generated
these
impulses
have
been
measured
by
delicate
galvanometers
and
magnified
millions
of
times
by
modern
amplifying
apparatus
until
now
no
satisfactory
method
had
been
found
to
study
the
passages
of
the
impulses
along
the
nerve
fibers
in
living
animals
or
man
because
of
the
great
speed
with
which
these
impulses
travel
drs
cole
and
curtis
reported
having
discovered
that
the
long
single
cells
of
the
plant
nitella
used
frequently
in
goldfish
bowls
are
virtually
identical
with
those
of
single
nerve
fibers
furthermore
they
found
that
nitella
fibers
on
being
excited
propagate
electrical
waves
that
are
similar
in
every
way
except
velocity
to
those
of
the
nerve
fibers
in
animals
and
man
the
electrical
nerve
impulses
in
the
plant
were
found
to
be
much
slower
than
those
in
animals
this
discovery
was
therefore
seized
upon
by
the
columbia
workers
as
a
means
for
taking
slow
motion
pictures
of
the
passage
of
the
electrical
impulses
in
nerves
the
nitella
plant
thus
may
become
a
sort
of
rosetta
stone
for
deciphering
the
closely
guarded
secrets
close
to
the
very
borderland
of
mind
and
matter
the
poet
rabindranath
tagore
was
a
stalwart
friend
of
idealistic
scientist
to
him
the
sweet
bengali
singer
addressed
the
following
lines
o
hermit
call
thou
in
the
authentic
words
of
that
old
hymn
called

rise

to
the

forth
this
call
unto
thy

band
together
round
thy

of

let
them
all
gather
so
may
our
india
our
ancient
land
unto
herself
return
o
once
again
return
to
steadfast
work
to
duty
and
devotion
to
her
trance
of
earnest
meditation
let
her
sit
once
more
unruffled
greedless
strifeless
pure
o
once
again
upon
her
lofty
seat
and

an
ancient
divine

in

its

the
expansion
of
the

the

of
its
pure

from
the
mud
of
its
origin
holds
a
benign
spiritual
promise
at
present
only
the
sheerest
accident
brings
india
into
the
purview
of
the
american
college
student
eight
universities
harvard
yale
columbia
princeton
johns
hopkins
pennsylvania
chicago
and
california
have
chairs
of
indology
or
sanskrit
but
india
is
virtually
unrepresented
in
departments
of
history
philosophy
fine
arts
political
science
sociology
or
any
of
the
other
departments
of
intellectual
experience
in
which
as
we
have
seen
india
has
made
great
contributions
we
believe
consequently
that
no
department
of
study
particularly
in
the
humanities
in
any
major
university
can
be
fully
equipped
without
a
properly
trained
specialist
in
the
indic
phases
of
its
discipline
we
believe
too
that
every
college
which
aims
to
prepare
its
graduates
for
intelligent
work
in
the
world
which
is
to
be
theirs
to
live
in
must
have
on
its
staff
a
scholar
competent
in
the
civilization
of
india
from
an
article
by
professor
norman
brown
of
the
university
of

years

the

and
his
cosmic
romance
little
sir
please
be
seated
i
am
talking
to
my
divine
mother
silently
i
had
entered
the
room
in
great
awe
the
angelic
appearance
of
master
mahasaya
fairly
dazzled
me
with
silky
white
beard
and
large
lustrous
eyes
he
seemed
an
incarnation
of
purity
his
upraised
chin
and
folded
hands
apprized
me
that
my
first
visit
had
disturbed
him
in
the
midst
of
his
devotions
his
simple
words
of
greeting
produced
the
most
violent
effect
my
nature
had
so
far
experienced
the
bitter
separation
of
my
death
i
had
thought
the
measure
of
all
anguish
now
an
agony
at
separation
from
my
divine
mother
was
an
indescribable
torture
of
the
spirit
i
fell
moaning
to
the
floor
little
sir
quiet
yourself
the
saint
was
sympathetically
distressed
abandoned
in
some
oceanic
desolation
i
clutched
his
feet
as
the
sole
raft
of
my
rescue
holy
sir
thy
intercession
ask
divine
mother
if
i
find
any
favor
in
her
sight
this
promise
is
one
not
easily
bestowed
the
master
was
constrained
to
silence
beyond
reach
of
doubt
i
was
convinced
that
master
mahasaya
was
in
intimate
converse
with
the
universal
mother
it
was
deep
humiliation
to
realize
that
my
eyes
were
blind
to
her
who
even
at
this
moment
was
perceptible
to
the
faultless
gaze
of
the
saint
shamelessly
gripping
his
feet
deaf
to
his
gentle
remonstrances
i
besought
him
again
and
again
for
his
intervening
grace
i
will
make
your
plea
to
the
beloved
the
master
capitulation
came
with
a
slow
compassionate
smile
what
power
in
those
few
words
that
my
being
should
know
release
from
its
stormy
exile
sir
remember
your
pledge
i
shall
return
soon
for
her
message
joyful
anticipation
rang
in
my
voice
that
only
a
moment
ago
had
been
sobbing
in
sorrow
descending
the
long
stairway
i
was
overwhelmed
by
memories
this
house
at
amherst
street
now
the
residence
of
master
mahasaya
had
once
been
my
family
home
scene
of
my
mother
death
here
my
human
heart
had
broken
for
the
vanished
mother
and
here
today
my
spirit
had
been
as
though
crucified
by
absence
of
the
divine
mother
hallowed
walls
silent
witness
of
my
grievous
hurts
and
final
healing
my
steps
were
eager
as
i
returned
to
my
gurpar
road
home
seeking
the
seclusion
of
my
small
attic
i
remained
in
meditation
until
ten
the
darkness
of
the
warm
indian
night
was
suddenly
lit
with
a
wondrous
vision
haloed
in
splendor
the
divine
mother
stood
before
me
her
face
tenderly
smiling
was
beauty
itself
always
have
i
loved
thee
ever
shall
i
love
thee
the
celestial
tones
still
ringing
in
the
air
she
disappeared
the
sun
on
the
following
morning
had
hardly
risen
to
an
angle
of
decorum
when
i
paid
my
second
visit
to
master
mahasaya
climbing
the
staircase
in
the
house
of
poignant
memories
i
reached
his
room
the
knob
of
the
closed
door
was
wrapped
around
with
a
cloth
a
hint
i
felt
that
the
saint
desired
privacy
as
i
stood
irresolutely
on
the
landing
the
door
was
opened
by
the
master
welcoming
hand
i
knelt
at
his
holy
feet
in
a
playful
mood
i
wore
a
solemn
mask
over
my
face
hiding
the
divine
elation
sir
i
have
early
i
confess
your
message
did
the
beloved
mother
say
anything
about
me
mischievous
little
sir
not
another
remark
would
he
make
apparently
my
assumed
gravity
was
unimpressive
why
so
mysterious
so
evasive
do
saints
never
speak
plainly
perhaps
i
was
a
little
provoked
must
you
test
me
his
calm
eyes
were
full
of
understanding
could
i
add
a
single
word
this
morning
to
the
assurance
you
received
last
night
at
ten
from
the
beautiful
mother
herself
master
mahasaya
possessed
control
over
the
of
my
soul
again
i
plunged
prostrate
at
his
feet
but
this
time
my
tears
welled
from
a
bliss
and
not
a
pain
past
bearing
think
you
that
your
devotion
did
not
touch
the
infinite
mercy
the
motherhood
of
god
that
you
have
worshiped
in
forms
both
human
and
divine
could
never
fail
to
answer
your
forsaken
cry
who
was
this
simple
saint
whose
least
request
to
the
universal
spirit
met
with
sweet
acquiescence
his
role
in
the
world
was
humble
as
befitted
the
greatest
man
of
humility
i
ever
knew
in
this
amherst
street
house
master
mahasaya
conducted
a
small
high
school
for
boys
no
words
of
chastisement
passed
his
lips
no
rule
and
ferule
maintained
his
discipline
higher
mathematics
indeed
were
taught
in
these
modest
classrooms
and
a
chemistry
of
love
absent
from
the
textbooks
he
spread
his
wisdom
by
spiritual
contagion
rather
than
impermeable
precept
consumed
by
an
unsophisticated
passion
for
the
divine
mother
the
saint
no
more
demanded
the
outward
forms
of
respect
than
a
child
i
am
not
your
guru
he
shall
come
a
little
later
he
told
me
through
his
guidance
your
experiences
of
the
divine
in
terms
of
love
and
devotion
shall
be
translated
into
his
terms
of
fathomless
wisdom
every
late
afternoon
i
betook
myself
to
amherst
street
i
sought
master
mahasaya
divine
cup
so
full
that
its
drops
daily
overflowed
on
my
being
never
before
had
i
bowed
in
utter
reverence
now
i
felt
it
an
immeasurable
privilege
even
to
tread
the
same
ground
which
master
mahasaya
sanctified
sir
please
wear
this
champak
garland
i
have
fashioned
especially
for
you
i
arrived
one
evening
holding
my
chain
of
flowers
but
shyly
he
drew
away
repeatedly
refusing
the
honor
perceiving
my
hurt
he
finally
smiled
consent
since
we
are
both
devotees
of
the
mother
you
may
put
the
garland
on
this
bodily
temple
as
offering
to
her
who
dwells
within
his
vast
nature
lacked
space
in
which
any
egotistical
consideration
could
gain
foothold

master
mahasaya
ever
engrossed
in
his
blissful
cosmic
see
let
us
go
tomorrow
to
the
dakshineswar
temple
forever
hallowed
by
my
guru
master
mahasaya
was
a
disciple
of
a
christlike
master
sri
ramakrishna
paramhansa
the
journey
on
the
following
morning
was
taken
by
boat
on
the
ganges
we
entered
the
temple
of
kali
where
the
figures
of
the
divine
mother
and
shiva
rest
on
a
burnished
silver
lotus
its
thousand
petals
meticulously
chiseled
master
mahasaya
beamed
in
enchantment
he
was
engaged
in
his
inexhaustible
romance
with
the
beloved
as
he
chanted
her
name
my
enraptured
heart
seemed
shattered
into
a
thousand
pieces
we
strolled
later
through
the
sacred
precincts
halting
in
a
tamarisk
grove
the
manna
characteristically
exuded
by
this
tree
was
symbolic
of
the
heavenly
food
master
mahasaya
was
bestowing
his
divine
invocations
continued
i
sat
rigidly
motionless
on
the
grass
amid
the
pink
feathery
tamarisk
flowers
temporarily
absent
from
the
body
i
soared
in
a
supernal
visit
this
was
the
first
of
many
pilgrimages
to
dakshineswar
with
the
holy
teacher
from
him
i
learned
the
sweetness
of
god
in
the
aspect
of
mother
or
divine
mercy
the
childlike
saint
found
little
appeal
in
the
father
aspect
or
divine
justice
stern
exacting
mathematical
judgment
was
alien
to
his
gentle
nature
he
can
serve
as
an
earthly
prototype
for
the
very
angels
of
heaven
i
thought
fondly
watching
him
one
day
at
his
prayers
without
a
breath
of
censure
or
criticism
he
surveyed
the
world
with
eyes
long
familiar
with
the
primal
purity
his
body
mind
speech
and
actions
were
effortlessly
harmonized
with
his
simplicity
my
master
told
me
so
shrinking
from
personal
assertion
the
saint
ended
any
sage
counsel
with
this
invariable
tribute
so
deep
was
his
identity
with
sri
ramakrishna
that
master
mahasaya
no
longer
considered
his
thoughts
as
his
own
hand
in
hand
the
saint
and
i
walked
one
evening
on
the
block
of
his
school
my
joy
was
dimmed
by
the
arrival
of
a
conceited
acquaintance
who
burdened
us
with
a
lengthy
discourse
i
see
this
man
does
please
you
the
saint
whisper
to
me
was
unheard
by
the
egotist
spellbound
by
his
own
monologue
i
have
spoken
to
divine
mother
about
it
she
realizes
our
sad
predicament
as
soon
as
we
get
to
yonder
red
house
she
has
promised
to
remind
him
of
more
urgent
business
my
eyes
were
glued
to
the
site
of
salvation
reaching
its
red
gate
the
man
unaccountably
turned
and
departed
neither
finishing
his
sentence
nor
saying
the
assaulted
air
was
comforted
with
peace
another
day
found
me
walking
alone
near
the
howrah
railway
station
i
stood
for
a
moment
by
a
temple
silently
criticizing
a
small
group
of
men
with
drum
and
cymbals
who
were
violently
reciting
a
chant
how
undevotionally
they
use
the
lord
divine
name
in
mechanical
repetition
i
reflected
my
gaze
was
astonished
by
the
rapid
approach
of
master
mahasaya
sir
how
come
you
here
the
saint
ignoring
my
question
answered
my
thought
is
it
true
little
sir
that
the
beloved
name
sounds
sweet
from
all
lips
ignorant
or
wise
he
passed
his
arm
around
me
affectionately
i
found
myself
carried
on
his
magic
carpet
to
the
merciful
presence
would
you
like
to
see
some
bioscopes
this
question
one
afternoon
from
master
mahasaya
was
mystifying
the
term
was
then
used
in
india
to
signify
motion
pictures
i
agreed
glad
to
be
in
his
company
in
any
circumstances
a
brisk
walk
brought
us
to
the
garden
fronting
calcutta
university
my
companion
indicated
a
bench
near
the
goldighi
or
pond
let
us
sit
here
for
a
few
minutes
my
master
always
asked
me
to
meditate
whenever
i
saw
an
expanse
of
water
here
its
placidity
reminds
us
of
the
vast
calmness
of
god
as
all
things
can
be
reflected
in
water
so
the
whole
universe
is
mirrored
in
the
lake
of
the
cosmic
mind
so
my
gurudeva
often
said
soon
we
entered
a
university
hall
where
a
lecture
was
in
progress
it
proved
abysmally
dull
though
varied
occasionally
by
lantern
slide
illustrations
equally
uninteresting
so
this
is
the
kind
of
bioscope
the
master
wanted
me
to
see
my
thought
was
impatient
yet
i
would
not
hurt
the
saint
by
revealing
boredom
in
my
face
but
he
leaned
toward
me
confidentially
i
see
little
sir
that
you
do
like
this
bioscope
i
have
mentioned
it
to
divine
mother
she
is
in
full
sympathy
with
us
both
she
tells
me
that
the
electric
lights
will
now
go
out
and
wo
be
relit
until
we
have
a
chance
to
leave
the
room
as
his
whisper
ended
the
hall
was
plunged
into
darkness
the
professor
strident
voice
was
stilled
in
astonishment
then
remarked
the
electrical
system
of
this
hall
appears
to
be
defective
by
this
time
master
mahasaya
and
i
were
safely
across
the
threshold
glancing
back
from
the
corridor
i
saw
that
the
scene
of
our
martyrdom
had
again
become
illuminated
little
sir
you
were
disappointed
in
that
bioscope
but
i
think
you
will
like
a
different
one
the
saint
and
i
were
standing
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
university
building
he
gently
slapped
my
chest
over
the
heart
a
transforming
silence
ensued
just
as
the
modern
talkies
become
inaudible
motion
pictures
when
the
sound
apparatus
goes
out
of
order
so
the
divine
hand
by
some
strange
miracle
stifled
the
earthly
bustle
the
pedestrians
as
well
as
the
passing
trolley
cars
automobiles
bullock
carts
and
hackney
carriages
were
all
in
noiseless
transit
as
though
possessing
an
omnipresent
eye
i
beheld
the
scenes
which
were
behind
me
and
to
each
side
as
easily
as
those
in
front
the
whole
spectacle
of
activity
in
that
small
section
of
calcutta
passed
before
me
without
a
sound
like
a
glow
of
fire
dimly
seen
beneath
a
thin
coat
of
ashes
a
mellow
luminescence
permeated
the
panoramic
view
my
own
body
seemed
nothing
more
than
one
of
the
many
shadows
though
it
was
motionless
while
the
others
flitted
mutely
to
and
fro
several
boys
friends
of
mine
approached
and
passed
on
though
they
had
looked
directly
at
me
it
was
without
recognition
the
unique
pantomime
brought
me
an
inexpressible
ecstasy
i
drank
deep
from
some
blissful
fount
suddenly
my
chest
received
another
soft
blow
from
master
mahasaya
the
pandemonium
of
the
world
burst
upon
my
unwilling
ears
i
staggered
as
though
harshly
awakened
from
a
gossamer
dream
the
transcendental
wine
removed
beyond
my
reach
little
sir
i
see
you
found
the
second
bioscope
to
your
liking
the
saint
was
smiling
i
started
to
drop
in
gratitude
on
the
ground
before
him
you
ca
do
that
to
me
now
you
know
god
is
in
your
temple
also
i
wo
let
divine
mother
touch
my
feet
through
your
hands
if
anyone
observed
the
unpretentious
master
and
myself
as
we
walked
away
from
the
crowded
pavement
the
onlooker
surely
suspected
us
of
intoxication
i
felt
that
the
falling
shades
of
evening
were
sympathetically
drunk
with
god
when
darkness
recovered
from
its
nightly
swoon
i
faced
the
new
morning
bereft
of
my
ecstatic
mood
but
ever
enshrined
in
memory
is
the
seraphic
son
of
divine
mahasaya
trying
with
poor
words
to
do
justice
to
his
benignity
i
wonder
if
master
mahasaya
and
others
among
the
saints
whose
paths
crossed
mine
knew
that
years
later
in
a
western
land
i
would
be
writing
about
their
lives
as
divine
devotees
their
foreknowledge
would
not
surprise
me
nor
i
hope
my
readers
who
have
come
thus
far
with
me
these
are
respectful
titles
by
which
he
was
customarily
addressed
his
name
was
mahendra
nath
gupta
he
signed
his
literary
works
simply
the
oxford
english
dictionary
gives
as
rare
this
definition
of
bioscope
a
view
of
life
that
which
gives
such
a
view
master
mahasaya
choice
of
a
word
was
then
peculiarly
justified
chapter
i
meet
my
master
sri
yukteswar
faith
in
god
can
produce
any
miracle
except
an
examination
without
study
distastefully
i
closed
the
book
i
had
picked
up
in
an
idle
moment
the
writer
exception
shows
his
complete
lack
of
faith
i
thought
poor
chap
he
has
great
respect
for
the
midnight
oil
my
promise
to
father
had
been
that
i
would
complete
my
high
school
studies
i
can
not
pretend
to
diligence
the
passing
months
found
me
less
frequently
in
the
classroom
than
in
secluded
spots
along
the
calcutta
bathing
ghats
the
adjoining
crematory
grounds
especially
gruesome
at
night
are
considered
highly
attractive
by
the
yogi
he
who
would
find
the
deathless
essence
must
not
be
dismayed
by
a
few
unadorned
skulls
human
inadequacy
becomes
clear
in
the
gloomy
abode
of
miscellaneous
bones
my
midnight
vigils
were
thus
of
a
different
nature
from
the
scholar
the
week
of
final
examinations
at
the
hindu
high
school
was
fast
approaching
this
interrogatory
period
like
the
sepulchral
haunts
inspires
a
terror
my
mind
was
nevertheless
at
peace
braving
the
ghouls
i
was
exhuming
a
knowledge
not
found
in
lecture
halls
but
it
lacked
the
art
of
swami
pranabananda
who
easily
appeared
in
two
places
at
one
time
my
educational
dilemma
was
plainly
a
matter
for
the
infinite
ingenuity
this
was
my
reasoning
though
to
many
it
seems
illogic
the
devotee
irrationality
springs
from
a
thousand
inexplicable
demonstrations
of
god
instancy
in
trouble
hello
mukunda
i
catch
hardly
a
glimpse
of
you
these
days
a
classmate
accosted
me
one
afternoon
on
gurpar
road
hello
nantu
my
invisibility
at
school
has
actually
placed
me
there
in
a
decidedly
awkward
position
i
unburdened
myself
under
his
friendly
gaze
nantu
who
was
a
brilliant
student
laughed
heartily
my
predicament
was
not
without
a
comic
aspect
you
are
utterly
unprepared
for
the
finals
i
suppose
it
is
up
to
me
to
help
you
the
simple
words
conveyed
divine
promise
to
my
ears
with
alacrity
i
visited
my
friend
home
he
kindly
outlined
the
solutions
to
various
problems
he
considered
likely
to
be
set
by
the
instructors
these
questions
are
the
bait
which
will
catch
many
trusting
boys
in
the
examination
trap
remember
my
answers
and
you
will
escape
without
injury
the
night
was
far
gone
when
i
departed
bursting
with
unseasoned
erudition
i
devoutly
prayed
it
would
remain
for
the
next
few
critical
days
nantu
had
coached
me
in
my
various
subjects
but
under
press
of
time
had
forgotten
my
course
in
sanskrit
fervently
i
reminded
god
of
the
oversight
i
set
out
on
a
short
walk
the
next
morning
assimilating
my
new
knowledge
to
the
rhythm
of
swinging
footsteps
as
i
took
a
short
cut
through
the
weeds
of
a
corner
lot
my
eye
fell
on
a
few
loose
printed
sheets
a
triumphant
pounce
proved
them
to
be
sanskrit
verse
i
sought
out
a
pundit
for
aid
in
my
stumbling
interpretation
his
rich
voice
filled
the
air
with
the
edgeless
honeyed
beauty
of
the
ancient
tongue
these
exceptional
stanzas
can
not
possibly
be
of
aid
in
your
sanskrit
test
the
scholar
dismissed
them
skeptically
but
familiarity
with
that
particular
poem
enabled
me
on
the
following
day
to
pass
the
sanskrit
examination
through
the
discerning
help
nantu
had
given
i
also
attained
the
minimum
grade
for
success
in
all
my
other
subjects
father
was
pleased
that
i
had
kept
my
word
and
concluded
my
secondary
school
course
my
gratitude
sped
to
the
lord
whose
sole
guidance
i
perceived
in
my
visit
to
nantu
and
my
walk
by
the
unhabitual
route
of
the
lot
playfully
he
had
given
a
dual
expression
to
his
timely
design
for
my
rescue
i
came
across
the
discarded
book
whose
author
had
denied
god
precedence
in
the
examination
halls
i
could
not
restrain
a
chuckle
at
my
own
silent
comment
it
would
only
add
to
this
fellow
confusion
if
i
were
to
tell
him
that
divine
meditation
among
the
cadavers
is
a
short
cut
to
a
high
school
diploma
in
my
new
dignity
i
was
now
openly
planning
to
leave
home
together
with
a
young
friend
jitendra
mazumdar
i
decided
to
join
a
mahamandal
hermitage
in
benares
and
receive
its
spiritual
discipline
a
desolation
fell
over
me
one
morning
at
thought
of
separation
from
my
family
since
mother
death
my
affection
had
grown
especially
tender
for
my
two
younger
brothers
sananda
and
bishnu
i
rushed
to
my
retreat
the
little
attic
which
had
witnessed
so
many
scenes
in
my
turbulent
sadhana
after
a
flood
of
tears
i
felt
singularly
transformed
as
by
some
alchemical
cleanser
all
attachment
disappeared
my
resolution
to
seek
god
as
the
friend
of
friends
set
like
granite
within
me
i
quickly
completed
my
travel
preparations
i
make
one
last
plea
father
was
distressed
as
i
stood
before
him
for
final
blessing
do
not
forsake
me
and
your
grieving
brothers
and
sisters
revered
father
how
can
i
tell
my
love
for
you
but
even
greater
is
my
love
for
the
heavenly
father
who
has
given
me
the
gift
of
a
perfect
father
on
earth
let
me
go
that
i
someday
return
with
a
more
divine
understanding
with
reluctant
parental
consent
i
set
out
to
join
jitendra
already
in
benares
at
the
hermitage
on
my
arrival
the
young
head
swami
dyananda
greeted
me
cordially
tall
and
thin
of
thoughtful
mien
he
impressed
me
favorably
his
fair
face
had
a
buddhalike
composure
i
was
pleased
that
my
new
home
possessed
an
attic
where
i
managed
to
spend
the
dawn
and
morning
hours
the
ashram
members
knowing
little
of
meditation
practices
thought
i
should
employ
my
whole
time
in
organizational
duties
they
gave
me
praise
for
my
afternoon
work
in
their
office
do
try
to
catch
god
so
soon
this
ridicule
from
a
fellow
resident
accompanied
one
of
my
early
departures
toward
the
attic
i
went
to
dyananda
busy
in
his
small
sanctum
overlooking
the
ganges
swamiji
i
do
understand
what
is
required
of
me
here
i
am
seeking
direct
perception
of
god
without
him
i
can
not
be
satisfied
with
affiliation
or
creed
or
performance
of
good
works
the
ecclesiastic
gave
me
an
affectionate
pat
staging
a
mock
rebuke
he
admonished
a
few
disciples
do
bother
mukunda
he
will
learn
our
ways
i
politely
concealed
my
doubt
the
students
left
the
room
not
overly
bent
with
their
chastisement
dyananda
had
further
words
for
me
mukunda
i
see
your
father
is
regularly
sending
you
money
please
return
it
to
him
you
require
none
here
a
second
injunction
for
your
discipline
concerns
food
even
when
you
feel
hunger
mention
it
whether
famishment
gleamed
in
my
eye
i
knew
not
that
i
was
hungry
i
knew
only
too
well
the
invariable
hour
for
the
first
hermitage
meal
was
twelve
noon
i
had
been
accustomed
in
my
own
home
to
a
large
breakfast
at
nine
the
gap
became
daily
more
interminable
gone
were
the
calcutta
years
when
i
could
rebuke
the
cook
for
a
delay
now
i
tried
to
control
my
appetite
one
day
i
undertook
a
hour
fast
with
double
zest
i
awaited
the
following
midday
dyanandaji
train
is
late
we
are
not
going
to
eat
until
he
arrives
jitendra
brought
me
this
devastating
news
as
gesture
of
welcome
to
the
swami
who
had
been
absent
for
two
weeks
many
delicacies
were
in
readiness
an
appetizing
aroma
filled
the
air
nothing
else
offering
what
else
could
be
swallowed
except
pride
over
yesterday
achievement
of
a
fast
lord
hasten
the
train
the
heavenly
provider
i
thought
was
hardly
included
in
the
interdiction
with
which
dyananda
had
silenced
me
divine
attention
was
elsewhere
however
the
plodding
clock
covered
the
hours
darkness
was
descending
as
our
leader
entered
the
door
my
greeting
was
one
of
unfeigned
joy
dyanandaji
will
bathe
and
meditate
before
we
can
serve
food
jitendra
approached
me
again
as
a
bird
of
ill
omen
i
was
in
my
young
stomach
new
to
deprivation
protested
with
gnawing
vigor
pictures
i
had
seen
of
famine
victims
passed
wraithlike
before
me
the
next
benares
death
from
starvation
is
due
at
once
in
this
hermitage
i
thought
impending
doom
averted
at
nine
ambrosial
summons
in
memory
that
meal
is
vivid
as
one
of
perfect
hours
intense
absorption
yet
permitted
me
to
observe
that
dyananda
ate
he
was
apparently
above
my
gross
pleasures
swamiji
were
you
hungry
happily
surfeited
i
was
alone
with
the
leader
in
his
study
o
yes
i
have
spent
the
last
four
days
without
food
or
drink
i
never
eat
on
trains
filled
with
the
heterogenous
vibrations
of
worldly
people
strictly
i
observe
the
shastric
rules
for
monks
of
my
particular
order
certain
problems
of
our
organizational
work
lie
on
my
mind
tonight
at
home
i
neglected
my
dinner
what
the
hurry
tomorrow
i
make
it
a
point
to
have
a
proper
meal
he
laughed
merrily
shame
spread
within
me
like
a
suffocation
but
the
past
day
of
my
torture
was
not
easily
forgotten
i
ventured
a
further
remark
swamiji
i
am
puzzled
following
your
instruction
suppose
i
never
asked
for
food
and
nobody
gives
me
any
i
should
starve
to
death
die
then
this
alarming
counsel
split
the
air
die
if
you
must
mukunda
never
admit
that
you
live
by
the
power
of
food
and
not
by
the
power
of
god
he
who
has
created
every
form
of
nourishment
he
who
has
bestowed
appetite
will
certainly
see
that
his
devotee
is
sustained
do
not
imagine
that
rice
maintains
you
or
that
money
or
men
support
you
could
they
aid
if
the
lord
withdraws
your
they
are
his
indirect
instruments
merely
is
it
by
any
skill
of
yours
that
food
digests
in
your
stomach
use
the
sword
of
your
discrimination
mukunda
cut
through
the
chains
of
agency
and
perceive
the
single
cause
i
found
his
incisive
words
entering
some
deep
marrow
gone
was
an
delusion
by
which
bodily
imperatives
outwit
the
soul
there
and
then
i
tasted
the
spirit
in
how
many
strange
cities
in
my
later
life
of
ceaseless
travel
did
occasion
arise
to
prove
the
serviceability
of
this
lesson
in
a
benares
hermitage
the
sole
treasure
which
had
accompanied
me
from
calcutta
was
the
sadhu
silver
amulet
bequeathed
to
me
by
mother
guarding
it
for
years
i
now
had
it
carefully
hidden
in
my
ashram
room
to
renew
my
joy
in
the
talismanic
testimony
one
morning
i
opened
the
locked
box
the
sealed
covering
untouched
lo
the
amulet
was
gone
mournfully
i
tore
open
its
envelope
and
made
unmistakably
sure
it
had
vanished
in
accordance
with
the
sadhu
prediction
into
the
ether
whence
he
had
summoned
it
my
relationship
with
dyananda
followers
grew
steadily
worse
the
household
was
alienated
hurt
by
my
determined
aloofness
my
strict
adherence
to
meditation
on
the
very
ideal
for
which
i
had
left
home
and
all
worldly
ambitions
called
forth
shallow
criticism
on
all
sides
torn
by
spiritual
anguish
i
entered
the
attic
one
dawn
resolved
to
pray
until
answer
was
vouchsafed
merciful
mother
of
the
universe
teach
me
thyself
through
visions
or
through
a
guru
sent
by
thee
the
passing
hours
found
my
sobbing
pleas
without
response
suddenly
i
felt
lifted
as
though
bodily
to
a
sphere
uncircumscribed
thy
master
cometh
today
a
divine
womanly
voice
came
from
everywhere
and
nowhere
this
supernal
experience
was
pierced
by
a
shout
from
a
definite
locale
a
young
priest
nicknamed
habu
was
calling
me
from
the
downstairs
kitchen
mukunda
enough
of
meditation
you
are
needed
for
an
errand
another
day
i
might
have
replied
impatiently
now
i
wiped
my
face
and
meekly
obeyed
the
summons
together
habu
and
i
set
out
for
a
distant
market
place
in
the
bengali
section
of
benares
the
ungentle
indian
sun
was
not
yet
at
zenith
as
we
made
our
purchases
in
the
bazaars
we
pushed
our
way
through
the
colorful
medley
of
housewives
guides
priests
widows
dignified
brahmins
and
the
ubiquitous
holy
bulls
passing
an
inconspicuous
lane
i
turned
my
head
and
surveyed
the
narrow
length
a
christlike
man
in
the
ocher
robes
of
a
swami
stood
motionless
at
the
end
of
the
road
instantly
and
anciently
familiar
he
seemed
my
gaze
fed
hungrily
for
a
trice
then
doubt
assailed
me
you
are
confusing
this
wandering
monk
with
someone
known
to
you
i
thought
dreamer
walk
on
after
ten
minutes
i
felt
heavy
numbness
in
my
feet
as
though
turned
to
stone
they
were
unable
to
carry
me
farther
laboriously
i
turned
around
my
feet
regained
normalcy
i
faced
the
opposite
direction
again
the
curious
weight
oppressed
me
the
saint
is
magnetically
drawing
me
to
him
with
this
thought
i
heaped
my
parcels
into
the
arms
of
habu
he
had
been
observing
my
erratic
footwork
with
amazement
and
now
burst
into
laughter
what
ails
you
are
you
crazy
my
tumultuous
emotion
prevented
any
retort
i
sped
silently
away
retracing
my
steps
as
though
i
reached
the
narrow
lane
my
quick
glance
revealed
the
quiet
figure
steadily
gazing
in
my
direction
a
few
eager
steps
and
i
was
at
his
feet
gurudeva
the
divine
face
was
none
other
than
he
of
my
thousand
visions
these
halcyon
eyes
in
leonine
head
with
pointed
beard
and
flowing
locks
had
oft
peered
through
gloom
of
my
nocturnal
reveries
holding
a
promise
i
had
not
fully
understood
o
my
own
you
have
come
to
me
my
guru
uttered
the
words
again
and
again
in
bengali
his
voice
tremulous
with
joy
how
many
years
i
have
waited
for
you
we
entered
a
oneness
of
silence
words
seemed
the
rankest
superfluities
eloquence
flowed
in
soundless
chant
from
heart
of
master
to
disciple
with
an
antenna
of
irrefragable
insight
i
sensed
that
my
guru
knew
god
and
would
lead
me
to
him
the
obscuration
of
this
life
disappeared
in
a
fragile
dawn
of
prenatal
memories
dramatic
time
past
present
and
future
are
its
cycling
scenes
this
was
not
the
first
sun
to
find
me
at
these
holy
feet
my
hand
in
his
my
guru
led
me
to
his
temporary
residence
in
the
rana
mahal
section
of
the
city
his
athletic
figure
moved
with
firm
tread
tall
erect
about
at
this
time
he
was
active
and
vigorous
as
a
young
man
his
dark
eyes
were
large
beautiful
with
plumbless
wisdom
slightly
curly
hair
softened
a
face
of
striking
power
strength
mingled
subtly
with
gentleness
as
we
made
our
way
to
the
stone
balcony
of
a
house
overlooking
the
ganges
he
said
affectionately
i
will
give
you
my
hermitages
and
all
i
possess
sir
i
come
for
wisdom
and
those
are
your
i
am
after
the
swift
indian
twilight
had
dropped
its
before
my
master
spoke
again
his
eyes
held
unfathomable
tenderness
i
give
you
my
unconditional
love
precious
words
a
elapsed
before
i
had
another
auricular
proof
of
his
love
his
lips
were
strange
to
ardor
silence
became
his
oceanic
heart
will
you
give
me
the
same
unconditional
love
he
gazed
at
me
with
childlike
trust
i
will
love
you
eternally
gurudeva
ordinary
love
is
selfish
darkly
rooted
in
desires
and
satisfactions
divine
love
is
without
condition
without
boundary
without
change
the
flux
of
the
human
heart
is
gone
forever
at
the
transfixing
touch
of
pure
love
he
added
humbly
if
ever
you
find
me
falling
from
a
state
of
please
promise
to
put
my
head
on
your
lap
and
help
to
bring
me
back
to
the
cosmic
beloved
we
both
worship
he
rose
then
in
the
gathering
darkness
and
guided
me
to
an
inner
room
as
we
ate
mangoes
and
almond
sweetmeats
he
unobtrusively
wove
into
his
conversation
an
intimate
knowledge
of
my
nature
i
was
at
the
grandeur
of
his
wisdom
exquisitely
blended
with
an
innate
humility
do
not
grieve
for
your
amulet
it
has
served
its
purpose
like
a
divine
mirror
my
guru
apparently
had
caught
a
reflection
of
my
whole
life
the
living
reality
of
your
presence
master
is
joy
beyond
any
symbol
it
is
time
for
a
change
inasmuch
as
you
are
unhappily
situated
in
the
hermitage
i
had
made
no
references
to
my
life
they
now
seemed
superfluous
by
his
natural
unemphatic
manner
i
understood
that
he
wished
no
astonished
ejaculations
at
his
clairvoyance
you
should
go
back
to
calcutta
why
exclude
relatives
from
your
love
of
humanity
his
suggestion
dismayed
me
my
family
was
predicting
my
return
though
i
had
been
unresponsive
to
many
pleas
by
letter
let
the
young
bird
fly
in
the
metaphysical
skies
ananta
had
remarked
his
wings
will
tire
in
the
heavy
atmosphere
we
shall
yet
see
him
swoop
toward
home
fold
his
pinions
and
humbly
rest
in
our
family
nest
this
discouraging
simile
fresh
in
my
mind
i
was
determined
to
do
no
swooping
in
the
direction
of
calcutta
sir
i
am
not
returning
home
but
i
will
follow
you
anywhere
please
give
me
your
address
and
your
name

my
chief
hermitage
is
in
serampore
on
rai
ghat
lane
i
am
visiting
my
mother
here
for
only
a
few
days
i
wondered
at
god
intricate
play
with
his
devotees
serampore
is
but
twelve
miles
from
calcutta
yet
in
those
regions
i
had
never
caught
a
glimpse
of
my
guru
we
had
had
to
travel
for
our
meeting
to
the
ancient
city
of
kasi
benares
hallowed
by
memories
of
lahiri
mahasaya
here
too
the
feet
of
buddha
shankaracharya
and
other
yogi
christs
had
blessed
the
soil
you
will
come
to
me
in
four
weeks
for
the
first
time
sri
yukteswar
voice
was
stern
now
i
have
told
my
eternal
affection
and
have
shown
my
happiness
at
finding
is
why
you
disregard
my
request
the
next
time
we
meet
you
will
have
to
reawaken
my
interest
i
wo
accept
you
as
a
disciple
easily
there
must
be
complete
surrender
by
obedience
to
my
strict
training
i
remained
obstinately
silent
my
guru
easily
penetrated
my
difficulty
do
you
think
your
relatives
will
laugh
at
you
i
will
not
return
you
will
return
in
thirty
days
never
bowing
reverently
at
his
feet
i
departed
without
lightening
the
controversial
tension
as
i
made
my
way
in
the
midnight
darkness
i
wondered
why
the
miraculous
meeting
had
ended
on
an
inharmonious
note
the
dual
scales
of
maya
that
balance
every
joy
with
a
grief
my
young
heart
was
not
yet
malleable
to
the
transforming
fingers
of
my
guru
the
next
morning
i
noticed
increased
hostility
in
the
attitude
of
the
hermitage
members
my
days
became
spiked
with
invariable
rudeness
in
three
weeks
dyananda
left
the
ashram
to
attend
a
conference
in
bombay
pandemonium
broke
over
my
hapless
head
mukunda
is
a
parasite
accepting
hermitage
hospitality
without
making
proper
return
overhearing
this
remark
i
regretted
for
the
first
time
that
i
had
obeyed
the
request
to
send
back
my
money
to
father
with
heavy
heart
i
sought
out
my
sole
friend
jitendra
i
am
leaving
please
convey
my
respectful
regrets
to
dyanandaji
when
he
returns
i
will
leave
also
my
attempts
to
meditate
here
meet
with
no
more
favor
than
your
own
jitendra
spoke
with
determination
i

met

if

disinherited
you
mukunda
how
foolishly
you
are
throwing
away
your
life
an
sermon
was
assaulting
my
ears
jitendra
and
i
fresh
from
the
train
a
figure
of
speech
merely
we
were
covered
with
dust
had
just
arrived
at
the
home
of
ananta
recently
transferred
from
calcutta
to
the
ancient
city
of
agra
brother
was
a
supervising
accountant
for
the
railway
you
well
know

seek
my
inheritance
from

heavenly

who
knows

long

first

is

who
can
tell
life
may
be
too
short
my
retort
was
summoned
by
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
and
held
no
presentiment
yet
the
leaves
of
time
unfolded
to
early
finality
for
ananta
a
few
years
later
he
entered
the
land
where
bank
notes
avail
neither
first
nor
last
wisdom
from
the
hermitage
i
suppose
but
i
see
you
have
left
benares
ananta
eyes
gleamed
with
satisfaction
he
yet
hoped
to
secure
my
pinions
in
the
family
nest
my
sojourn
in
benares
was
not
in
vain
i
found
there
everything
my
heart
had
been
longing
for
you
may
be
sure
it
was
not
your
pundit
or
his
son
ananta
joined
me
in
reminiscent
laughter
he
had
had
to
admit
that
the
benares
clairvoyant
he
selected
was
a
shortsighted
one
what
are
your
plans
my
wandering
brother
jitendra
persuaded
me
to
agra
we
shall
view
the
beauties
of
the
taj
mahal
here
i
explained
then
we
are
going
to
my
guru
who
has
a
hermitage
in
serampore
ananta
hospitably
arranged
for
our
comfort
several
times
during
the
evening
i
noticed
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
reflectively
i
know
that
look
i
thought
a
plot
is
brewing
the
denouement
took
place
during
our
early
breakfast
so
you
feel
quite
independent
of
father
wealth
ananta
gaze
was
innocent
as
he
resumed
the
barbs
of
yesterday
conversation
i
am
conscious
of
my
dependence
on
god
words
are
cheap
life
has
shielded
you
thus
far
what
a
plight
if
you
were
forced
to
look
to
the
invisible
hand
for
your
food
and
shelter
you
would
soon
be
begging
on
the
streets
never
i
would
not
put
faith
in
rather
than
god
he
can
devise
for
his
devotee
a
thousand
resources
besides
the
more
rhetoric
suppose
i
suggest
that
your
vaunted
philosophy
be
put
to
a
test
in
this
tangible
world
i
would
agree
do
you
confine
god
to
a
speculative
world
we
shall
see
today
you
shall
have
opportunity
either
to
enlarge
or
to
confirm
my
own
views
ananta
paused
for
a
dramatic
moment
then
spoke
slowly
and
seriously
i
propose
that
i
send
you
and
your
fellow
disciple
jitendra
this
morning
to
the
city
of
brindaban
you
must
not
take
a
single
rupee
you
must
not
beg
either
for
food
or
money
you
must
not
reveal
your
predicament
to
anyone
you
must
not
go
without
your
meals
and
you
must
not
be
stranded
in
brindaban
if
you
return
to
my
bungalow
here
before
twelve
tonight
without
having
broken
any
rule
of
the
test
i
shall
be
the
most
astonished
man
in
agra
i
accept
the
challenge
no
hesitation
was
in
my
words
or
in
my
heart
grateful
memories
flashed
of
the
instant
beneficence
my
healing
of
deadly
cholera
through
appeal
to
lahiri
picture
the
playful
gift
of
the
two
kites
on
the
lahore
roof
with
uma
the
opportune
amulet
amidst
my
discouragement
the
decisive
message
through
the
unknown
benares
sadhu
outside
the
compound
of
the
pundit
home
the
vision
of
divine
mother
and
her
majestic
words
of
love
her
swift
heed
through
master
mahasaya
to
my
trifling
embarrassments
the
guidance
which
materialized
my
high
school
diploma
and
the
ultimate
boon
my
living
master
from
the
mist
of
lifelong
dreams
never
could
i
admit
my
philosophy
unequal
to
any
tussle
on
the
world
harsh
proving
ground
your
willingness
does
you
credit
i
escort
you
to
the
train
at
once
ananta
turned
to
the
openmouthed
jitendra
you
must
go
along
as
a
witness
and
very
likely
a
fellow
victim
a
half
hour
later
jitendra
and
i
were
in
possession
of
tickets
for
our
impromptu
trip
we
submitted
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
station
to
a
search
of
our
persons
ananta
was
quickly
satisfied
that
we
were
carrying
no
hidden
hoard
our
simple
dhotis
concealed
nothing
more
than
was
necessary
as
faith
invaded
the
serious
realms
of
finance
my
friend
spoke
protestingly
ananta
give
me
one
or
two
rupees
as
a
safeguard
then
i
can
telegraph
you
in
case
of
misfortune
jitendra
my
ejaculation
was
sharply
reproachful
i
will
not
proceed
with
the
test
if
you
take
any
money
as
final
security
there
is
something
reassuring
about
the
clink
of
coins
jitendra
said
no
more
as
i
regarded
him
sternly
mukunda
i
am
not
heartless
a
hint
of
humility
had
crept
into
ananta
voice
it
may
be
that
his
conscience
was
smiting
him
perhaps
for
sending
two
insolvent
boys
to
a
strange
city
perhaps
for
his
own
religious
skepticism
if
by
any
chance
or
grace
you
pass
successfully
through
the
brindaban
ordeal
i
shall
ask
you
to
initiate
me
as
your
disciple
this
promise
had
a
certain
irregularity
in
keeping
with
the
unconventional
occasion
the
eldest
brother
in
an
indian
family
seldom
bows
before
his
juniors
he
receives
respect
and
obedience
second
only
to
a
father
but
no
time
remained
for
my
comment
our
train
was
at
point
of
departure
jitendra
maintained
a
lugubrious
silence
as
our
train
covered
the
miles
finally
he
bestirred
himself
leaning
over
he
pinched
me
painfully
at
an
awkward
spot
i
see
no
sign
that
god
is
going
to
supply
our
next
meal
be
quiet
doubting
thomas
the
lord
is
working
with
us
can
you
also
arrange
that
he
hurry
already
i
am
famished
merely
at
the
prospect
before
us
i
left
benares
to
view
the
taj
mausoleum
not
to
enter
my
own
cheer
up
jitendra
are
we
not
to
have
our
first
glimpse
of
the
sacred
wonders
of
brindaban
i
am
in
deep
joy
at
thought
of
treading
the
ground
hallowed
by
feet
of
lord
krishna
the
door
of
our
compartment
opened
two
men
seated
themselves
the
next
train
stop
would
be
the
last
young
lads
do
you
have
friends
in
brindaban
the
stranger
opposite
me
was
taking
a
surprising
interest
none
of
your
business
rudely
i
averted
my
gaze
you
are
probably
flying
away
from
your
families
under
the
enchantment
of
the
stealer
of
hearts
i
am
of
devotional
temperament
myself
i
will
make
it
my
positive
duty
to
see
that
you
receive
food
and
shelter
from
this
overpowering
heat
no
sir
let
us
alone
you
are
very
kind
but
you
are
mistaken
in
judging
us
to
be
truants
from
home
no
further
conversation
ensued
the
train
came
to
a
halt
as
jitendra
and
i
descended
to
the
platform
our
chance
companions
linked
arms
with
us
and
summoned
a
horse
cab
we
alit
before
a
stately
hermitage
set
amidst
the
evergreen
trees
of
grounds
our
benefactors
were
evidently
known
here
a
smiling
lad
led
us
without
comment
to
a
parlor
we
were
soon
joined
by
an
elderly
woman
of
dignified
bearing
gauri
ma
the
princes
could
not
come
one
of
the
men
addressed
the
ashram
hostess
at
the
last
moment
their
plans
went
awry
they
send
deep
regrets
but
we
have
brought
two
other
guests
as
soon
as
we
met
on
the
train
i
felt
drawn
to
them
as
devotees

door
we
shall
meet
again
if
god
be
willing
you
are
welcome
here
gauri
ma
smiled
in
motherly
fashion
on
her
two
unexpected
charges
you
could
not
have
come
on
a
better
day
i
was
expecting
two
royal
patrons
of
this
hermitage
what
a
shame
if
my
cooking
had
found
none
to
appreciate
it
these
appetizing
words
had
disastrous
effect
on
jitendra
he
burst
into
tears
the
prospect
he
had
feared
in
brindaban
was
turning
out
as
royal
entertainment
his
sudden
mental
adjustment
proved
too
much
for
him
our
hostess
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
but
without
remark
perhaps
she
was
familiar
with
adolescent
quirks
lunch
was
announced
gauri
ma
led
the
way
to
a
dining
patio
spicy
with
savory
odors
she
vanished
into
an
adjoining
kitchen
i
had
been
premeditating
this
moment
selecting
the
appropriate
spot
on
jitendra
anatomy
i
administered
a
pinch
as
resounding
as
the
one
he
had
given
me
on
the
train
doubting
thomas
the
lord
a
hurry
too
the
hostess
reentered
with
a
punkha
she
steadily
fanned
us
in
the
oriental
fashion
as
we
squatted
on
ornate
ashram
disciples
passed
to
and
fro
with
some
thirty
courses
rather
than
meal
the
description
can
only
be
sumptuous
repast
since
arriving
on
this
planet
jitendra
and
i
had
never
before
tasted
such
delicacies
dishes
fit
for
princes
indeed
honored
mother
what
your
royal
patrons
could
have
found
more
urgent
than
attending
this
banquet
i
can
not
imagine
you
have
given
us
a
memory
for
a
lifetime
silenced
as
we
were
by
ananta
requirement
we
could
not
explain
to
the
gracious
lady
that
our
thanks
held
a
double
significance
our
sincerity
at
least
was
patent
we
departed
with
her
blessing
and
an
attractive
invitation
to
revisit
the
hermitage
the
heat
outdoors
was
merciless
my
friend
and
i
made
for
the
shelter
of
a
lordly
cadamba
tree
at
the
ashram
gate
sharp
words
followed
once
again
jitendra
was
beset
with
misgivings
a
fine
mess
you
have
got
me
into
our
luncheon
was
only
accidental
good
fortune
how
can
we
see
the
sights
of
this
city
without
a
single
pice
between
us
and
how
on
earth
are
you
going
to
take
me
back
to
ananta
you
forget
god
quickly
now
that
your
stomach
is
filled
my
words
not
bitter
were
accusatory
how
short
is
human
memory
for
divine
favors
no
man
lives
who
has
not
seen
certain
of
his
prayers
granted
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
my
folly
in
venturing
out
with
a
madcap
like
you
be
quiet
jitendra
the
same
lord
who
fed
us
will
show
us
brindaban
and
return
us
to
agra
a
slight
young
man
of
pleasing
countenance
approached
at
rapid
pace
halting
under
our
tree
he
bowed
before
me
dear
friend
you
and
your
companion
must
be
strangers
here
permit
me
to
be
your
host
and
guide
it
is
scarcely
possible
for
an
indian
to
pale
but
jitendra
face
was
suddenly
sickly
i
politely
declined
the
offer
you
are
surely
not
banishing
me
the
stranger
alarm
would
have
been
comic
in
any
other
circumstances
why
not
you
are
my
guru
his
eyes
sought
mine
trustfully
during
my
midday
devotions
the
blessed
lord
krishna
appeared
in
a
vision
he
showed
me
two
forsaken
figures
under
this
very
tree
one
face
was
yours
my
master
often
have
i
seen
it
in
meditation
what
joy
if
you
accept
my
humble
services
i
too
am
glad
you
have
found
me
neither
god
nor
man
has
forsaken
us
though
i
was
motionless
smiling
at
the
eager
face
before
me
an
inward
obeisance
cast
me
at
the
divine
feet
dear
friends
will
you
not
honor
my
home
for
a
visit
you
are
kind
but
the
plan
is
unfeasible
already
we
are
guests
of
my
brother
in
agra
at
least
give
me
memories
of
touring
brindaban
with
you
i
gladly
consented
the
young
man
who
said
his
name
was
pratap
chatterji
hailed
a
horse
carriage
we
visited
madanamohana
temple
and
other
krishna
shrines
night
descended
while
we
were
at
our
temple
devotions
excuse
me
while
i
get
sandesh
pratap
entered
a
shop
near
the
railroad
station
jitendra
and
i
sauntered
along
the
wide
street
crowded
now
in
the
comparative
coolness
our
friend
was
absent
for
some
time
but
finally
returned
with
gifts
of
many
sweetmeats
please
allow
me
to
gain
this
religious
merit
pratap
smiled
pleadingly
as
he
held
out
a
bundle
of
rupee
notes
and
two
tickets
just
purchased
to
agra
the
reverence
of
my
acceptance
was
for
the
invisible
hand
scoffed
at
by
ananta
had
its
bounty
not
far
exceeded
necessity
we
sought
out
a
secluded
spot
near
the
station
pratap
i
will
instruct
you
in
the
kriya
of
lahiri
mahasaya
the
greatest
yogi
of
modern
times
his
technique
will
be
your
guru
the
initiation
was
concluded
in
a
half
hour
kriya
is
your
chintamani
i
told
the
new
student
the
technique
which
as
you
see
is
simple
embodies
the
art
of
quickening
man
spiritual
evolution
hindu
scriptures
teach
that
the
incarnating
ego
requires
a
million
years
to
obtain
liberation
from
maya
this
natural
period
is
greatly
shortened
through
kriya
yoga
just
as
jagadis
chandra
bose
has
demonstrated
that
plant
growth
can
be
accelerated
far
beyond
its
normal
rate
so
man
psychological
development
can
be
also
speeded
by
an
inner
science
be
faithful
in
your
practice
you
will
approach
the
guru
of
all
gurus
i
am
transported
to
find
this
yogic
key
long
sought
pratap
spoke
thoughtfully
its
unshackling
effect
on
my
sensory
bonds
will
free
me
for
higher
spheres
the
vision
today
of
lord
krishna
could
only
mean
my
highest
good
we
sat
awhile
in
silent
understanding
then
walked
slowly
to
the
station
joy
was
within
me
as
i
boarded
the
train
but
this
was
jitendra
day
for
tears
my
affectionate
farewell
to
pratap
had
been
punctuated
by
stifled
sobs
from
both
my
companions
the
journey
once
more
found
jitendra
in
a
welter
of
grief
not
for
himself
this
time
but
against
himself
how
shallow
my
trust
my
heart
has
been
stone
never
in
future
shall
i
doubt
god
protection
midnight
was
approaching
the
two
cinderellas
sent
forth
penniless
entered
ananta
bedroom
his
face
as
he
had
promised
was
a
study
in
astonishment
silently
i
showered
the
table
with
rupees
jitendra
the
truth
ananta
tone
was
jocular
has
not
this
youngster
been
staging
a
holdup
but
as
the
tale
was
unfolded
my
brother
turned
sober
then
solemn
the
law
of
demand
and
supply
reaches
into
subtler
realms
than
i
had
supposed
ananta
spoke
with
a
spiritual
enthusiasm
never
before
noticeable
i
understand
for
the
first
time
your
indifference
to
the
vaults
and
vulgar
accumulations
of
the
world
late
as
it
was
my
brother
insisted
that
he
receive
diksha
into
kriya
yoga
the
guru
mukunda
had
to
shoulder
the
responsibility
of
two
unsought
disciples
in
one
day
breakfast
the
following
morning
was
eaten
in
a
harmony
absent
the
day
before
i
smiled
at
jitendra
you
shall
not
be
cheated
of
the
taj
let
us
view
it
before
starting
for
serampore
bidding
farewell
to
ananta
my
friend
and
i
were
soon
before
the
glory
of
agra
the
taj

white
marble
dazzling
in
the
sun
it
stands
a
vision
of
pure
symmetry
the
perfect
setting
is
dark
cypress
glossy
lawn
and
tranquil
lagoon
the
interior
is
exquisite
with
lacelike
carvings
inlaid
with
semiprecious
stones
delicate
wreaths
and
scrolls

intricately

enough
of
i
was
longing
for
my
guru
jitendra
and
i
were
shortly
traveling
south
by
train
toward
bengal
mukunda
i
have
not
seen
my
family
in
months
i
have
changed
my
mind
perhaps
later
i
shall
visit
your
master
in
serampore
my
friend
who
may
mildly
be
described
as
vacillating
in
temperament
left
me
in
calcutta
by
local
train
i
soon
reached
serampore
twelve
miles
to
the
north
a
throb
of
wonderment
stole
over
me
as
i
realized
that
days
had
elapsed
since
the
benares
meeting
with
my
guru
you
will
come
to
me
in
four
weeks
here
i
was
heart
pounding
standing
within
his
courtyard
on
quiet
rai
ghat
lane
i
entered
for
the
first
time
the
hermitage
where
i
was
to
spend
the
best
part
of
the
next
ten
years
with
india
jyanavatar
incarnation
of
wisdom
see

the

knotted
around
the

and
covers
the
brindaban
in
the
muttra
district
of
united
provinces
is
the
hindu
jerusalem
here
lord
krishna
displayed
his
glories
for
the
benefit
of
hari
an
endearing
name
by
which
lord
krishna
is
known
to
his
devotees
an
indian
a
mythological
gem
with
power
to
grant
desires
spiritual
initiation
from
the
sanskrit
root
diksh
to
dedicate
oneself
chapter
years
in
my
master
hermitage
you
have
come
sri
yukteswar
greeted
me
from
a
tiger
skin
on
the
floor
of
a
balconied
sitting
room
his
voice
was
cold
his
manner
unemotional
yes
dear
master
i
am
here
to
follow
you
kneeling
i
touched
his
feet
how
can
that
be
you
ignore
my
wishes
no
longer
guruji
your
wish
shall
be
my
law
that
is
better
now
i
can
assume
responsibility
for
your
life
i
willingly
transfer
the
burden
master
my
first
request
then
is
that
you
return
home
to
your
family
i
want
you
to
enter
college
in
calcutta
your
education
should
be
continued
very
well
sir
i
hid
my
consternation
would
importunate
books
pursue
me
down
the
years
first
father
now
sri
yukteswar
someday
you
will
go
to
the
west
its
people
will
lend
ears
more
receptive
to
india
ancient
wisdom
if
the
strange
hindu
teacher
has
a
university
degree
you
know
best
guruji
my
gloom
departed
the
reference
to
the
west
i
found
puzzling
remote
but
my
opportunity
to
please
master
by
obedience
was
vitally
immediate
you
will
be
near
in
calcutta
come
here
whenever
you
find
time
every
day
if
possible
master
gratefully
i
accept
your
authority
in
every
detail
of
my
one
condition
yes
that
you
promise
to
reveal
god
to
me
an
verbal
tussle
ensued
a
master
word
can
not
be
falsified
it
is
not
lightly
given
the
implications
in
the
pledge
open
out
vast
metaphysical
vistas
a
guru
must
be
on
intimate
terms
indeed
with
the
creator
before
he
can
obligate
him
to
appear
i
sensed
sri
yukteswar
divine
unity
and
was
determined
as
his
disciple
to
press
my
advantage
you
are
of
exacting
disposition
then
master
consent
rang
out
with
compassionate
finality
let
your
wish
be
my
wish
lifelong
shadow
lifted
from
my
heart
the
vague
search
hither
and
yon
was
over
i
had
found
eternal
shelter
in
a
true
guru
come
i
will
show
you
the
hermitage
master
rose
from
his
tiger
mat
i
glanced
about
me
my
gaze
fell
with
astonishment
on
a
wall
picture
garlanded
with
a
spray
of
jasmine
lahiri
mahasaya
yes
my
divine
guru
sri
yukteswar
tone
was
reverently
vibrant
greater
he
was
as
man
and
yogi
than
any
other
teacher
whose
life
came
within
the
range
of
my
investigations
silently
i
bowed
before
the
familiar
picture
sped
to
the
peerless
master
who
blessing
my
infancy
had
guided
my
steps
to
this
hour
led
by
my
guru
i
strolled
over
the
house
and
its
grounds
large
ancient
and
the
hermitage
was
surrounded
by
a
courtyard
outer
walls
were
pigeons
fluttered
over
the
flat
gray
roof
unceremoniously
sharing
the
ashram
quarters
a
rear
garden
was
pleasant
with
jackfruit
mango
and
plantain
trees
balustraded
balconies
of
upper
rooms
in
the
building
faced
the
courtyard
from
three
sides
a
spacious
hall
with
high
ceiling
supported
by
colonnades
was
used
master
said
chiefly
during
the
annual
festivities
of
durgapuja
a
narrow
stairway
led
to
sri
yukteswar
sitting
room
whose
small
balcony
overlooked
the
street
the
ashram
was
plainly
furnished
everything
was
simple
clean
and
utilitarian
several
western
styled
chairs
benches
and
tables
were
in
evidence
master
invited
me
to
stay
overnight
a
supper
of
vegetable
curry
was
served
by
two
young
disciples
who
were
receiving
hermitage
training
guruji
please
tell
me
something
of
your
life
i
was
squatting
on
a
straw
mat
near
his
tiger
skin
the
friendly
stars
were
very
close
it
seemed
beyond
the
balcony
my
family
name
was
priya
nath
karar
i
was
born
here
in
serampore
where
father
was
a
wealthy
businessman
he
left
me
this
ancestral
mansion
now
my
hermitage
my
formal
schooling
was
little
i
found
it
slow
and
shallow
in
early
manhood
i
undertook
the
responsibilities
of
a
householder
and
have
one
daughter
now
married
my
middle
life
was
blessed
with
the
guidance
of
lahiri
mahasaya
after
my
wife
died
i
joined
the
swami
order
and
received
the
new
name
of
sri
yukteswar
giri
such
are
my
simple
annals
master
smiled
at
my
eager
face
like
all
biographical
sketches
his
words
had
given
the
outward
facts
without
revealing
the
inner
man
guruji
i
would
like
to
hear
some
stories
of
your
childhood
i
will
tell
you
a
one
with
a
moral
sri
eyes
twinkled
with
his
warning
my
mother
once
tried
to
frighten
me
with
an
appalling
story
of
a
ghost
in
a
dark
chamber
i
went
there
immediately
and
expressed
my
disappointment
at
having
missed
the
ghost
mother
never
told
me
another
moral
look
fear
in
the
face
and
it
will
cease
to
trouble
you
another
early
memory
is
my
wish
for
an
ugly
dog
belonging
to
a
neighbor
i
kept
my
household
in
turmoil
for
weeks
to
get
that
dog
my
ears
were
deaf
to
offers
of
pets
with
more
prepossessing
appearance
moral
attachment
is
blinding
it
lends
an
imaginary
halo
of
attractiveness
to
the
object
of
desire
a
third
story
concerns
the
plasticity
of
the
youthful
mind
i
heard
my
mother
remark
occasionally
man
who
accepts
a
job
under
anyone
is
a
slave
that
impression
became
so
indelibly
fixed
that
even
after
my
marriage
i
refused
all
positions
i
met
expenses
by
investing
my
family
endowment
in
land
moral
good
and
positive
suggestions
should
instruct
the
sensitive
ears
of
children
their
early
ideas
long
remain
sharply
etched
master
fell
into
tranquil
silence
around
midnight
he
led
me
to
a
narrow
cot
sleep
was
sound
and
sweet
the
first
night
under
my
guru
roof
sri
yukteswar
chose
the
following
morning
to
grant
me
his
kriya
yoga
initiation
the
technique
i
had
already
received
from
two
disciples
of
lahiri
and
my
tutor
swami
in
master
presence
i
felt
transforming
power
at
his
touch
a
great
light
broke
upon
my
being
like
glory
of
countless
suns
blazing
together
a
flood
of
ineffable
bliss
overwhelming
my
heart
to
an
innermost
core
continued
during
the
following
day
it
was
late
that
afternoon
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
leave
the
hermitage
you
will
return
in
thirty
days
as
i
reached
my
calcutta
home
the
fulfillment
of
master
prediction
entered
with
me
none
of
my
relatives
made
the
pointed
remarks
i
had
feared
about
the
reappearance
of
the
soaring
bird
i
climbed
to
my
little
attic
and
bestowed
affectionate
glances
as
though
on
a
living
presence
you
have
witnessed
my
meditations
and
the
tears
and
storms
of
my
sadhana
now
i
have
reached
the
harbor
of
my
divine
teacher
son
i
am
happy
for
us
both
father
and
i
sat
together
in
the
evening
calm
you
have
found
your
guru
as
in
miraculous
fashion
i
once
found
my
own
the
holy
hand
of
lahiri
mahasaya
is
guarding
our
lives
your
master
has
proved
no
inaccessible
himalayan
saint
but
one
my
prayers
have
been
answered
you
have
not
in
your
search
for
god
been
permanently
removed
from
my
sight
father
was
also
pleased
that
my
formal
studies
would
be
resumed
he
made
suitable
arrangements
i
was
enrolled
the
following
day
at
the
scottish
church
college
in
calcutta
happy
months
sped
by
my
readers
have
doubtless
made
the
perspicacious
surmise
that
i
was
little
seen
in
the
college
classrooms
the
serampore
hermitage
held
a
lure
too
irresistible
master
accepted
my
ubiquitous
presence
without
comment
to
my
relief
he
seldom
referred
to
the
halls
of
learning
though
it
was
plain
to
all
that
i
was
never
cut
out
for
a
scholar
i
managed
to
attain
minimum
passing
grades
from
time
to
time
daily
life
at
the
ashram
flowed
smoothly
infrequently
varied
my
guru
awoke
before
dawn
lying
down
or
sometimes
sitting
on
the
bed
he
entered
a
state
of
samadhi
it
was
simplicity
itself
to
discover
when
master
had
awakened
abrupt
halt
of
stupendous
snores
a
sigh
or
two
perhaps
a
bodily
movement
then
a
soundless
state
of
breathlessness
he
was
in
deep
yogic
joy
breakfast
did
not
follow
first
came
a
long
walk
by
the
ganges
those
morning
strolls
with
my
real
and
vivid
still
in
the
easy
resurrection
of
memory
i
often
find
myself
by
his
side
the
early
sun
is
warming
the
river
his
voice
rings
out
rich
with
the
authenticity
of
wisdom
a
bath
then
the
midday
meal
its
preparation
according
to
daily
directions
had
been
the
careful
task
of
young
disciples
my
guru
was
a
vegetarian
before
embracing
monkhood
however
he
had
eaten
eggs
and
fish
his
advice
to
students
was
to
follow
any
simple
diet
which
proved
suited
to
one
constitution
master
ate
little
often
rice
colored
with
turmeric
or
juice
of
beets
or
spinach
and
lightly
sprinkled
with
buffalo
ghee
or
melted
butter
another
day
he
might
have
or
channa
curry
with
vegetables
for
dessert
mangoes
or
oranges
with
rice
pudding
or
jackfruit
juice
visitors
appeared
in
the
afternoons
a
steady
stream
poured
from
the
world
into
the
hermitage
tranquillity
everyone
found
in
master
an
equal
courtesy
and
kindness
to
a
man
who
has
realized
himself
as
a
soul
not
the
body
or
the
ego
the
rest
of
humanity
assumes
a
striking
similarity
of
aspect
the
impartiality
of
saints
is
rooted
in
wisdom
masters
have
escaped
maya
its
alternating
faces
of
intellect
and
idiocy
no
longer
cast
an
influential
glance
sri
yukteswar
showed
no
special
consideration
to
those
who
happened
to
be
powerful
or
accomplished
neither
did
he
slight
others
for
their
poverty
or
illiteracy
he
would
listen
respectfully
to
words
of
truth
from
a
child
and
openly
ignore
a
conceited
pundit
illustration
my
master
sri
yukteswar
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
see
eight
was
the
supper
hour
and
sometimes
found
lingering
guests
my
guru
would
not
excuse
himself
to
eat
alone
none
left
his
ashram
hungry
or
dissatisfied
sri
yukteswar
was
never
at
a
loss
never
dismayed
by
unexpected
visitors
scanty
food
would
emerge
a
banquet
under
his
resourceful
direction
yet
he
was
economical
his
modest
funds
went
far
be
comfortable
within
your
purse
he
often
said
extravagance
will
buy
you
discomfort
whether
in
the
details
of
hermitage
entertainment
or
his
building
and
repair
work
or
other
practical
concerns
master
manifested
the
originality
of
a
creative
spirit
quiet
evening
hours
often
brought
one
of
my
guru
discourses
treasures
against
time
his
every
utterance
was
measured
and
chiseled
by
wisdom
a
sublime
marked
his
mode
of
expression
it
was
unique
he
spoke
as
none
other
in
my
experience
ever
spoke
his
thoughts
were
weighed
in
a
delicate
balance
of
discrimination
before
he
permitted
them
an
outward
garb
the
essence
of
truth
with
even
a
physiological
aspect
came
from
him
like
a
fragrant
exudation
of
the
soul
i
was
conscious
always
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
living
manifestation
of
god
the
weight
of
his
divinity
automatically
bowed
my
head
before
him
if
late
guests
detected
that
sri
yukteswar
was
becoming
engrossed
with
the
infinite
he
quickly
engaged
them
in
conversation
he
was
incapable
of
striking
a
pose
or
of
flaunting
his
inner
withdrawal
always
one
with
the
lord
he
needed
no
separate
time
for
communion
a
master
has
already
left
behind
the
stepping
stone
of
meditation
the
flower
falls
when
the
fruit
appears
but
saints
often
cling
to
spiritual
forms
for
the
encouragement
of
disciples
as
midnight
approached
my
guru
might
fall
into
a
doze
with
the
naturalness
of
a
child
there
was
no
fuss
about
bedding
he
often
lay
down
without
even
a
pillow
on
a
narrow
davenport
which
was
the
background
for
his
customary
seat
a
philosophical
discussion
was
not
rare
any
disciple
could
summon
it
by
intensity
of
interest
i
felt
no
tiredness
then
no
desire
for
sleep
master
living
words
were
sufficient
oh
it
is
dawn
let
us
walk
by
the
ganges
so
ended
many
of
my
periods
of
nocturnal
edification
my
early
months
with
sri
yukteswar
culminated
in
a
useful
how
to
outwit
a
mosquito
at
home
my
family
always
used
protective
curtains
at
night
i
was
dismayed
to
discover
that
in
the
serampore
hermitage
this
prudent
custom
was
honored
in
the
breach
yet
the
insects
were
in
full
residency
i
was
bitten
from
head
to
foot
my
guru
took
pity
on
me
buy
yourself
a
curtain
and
also
one
for
me
he
laughed
and
added
if
you
buy
only
one
for
yourself
all
mosquitoes
will
concentrate
on
me
i
was
more
than
thankful
to
comply
every
night
that
i
spent
in
serampore
my
guru
would
ask
me
to
arrange
the
bedtime
curtains
the
mosquitoes
one
evening
were
especially
virulent
but
master
failed
to
issue
his
usual
instructions
i
listened
nervously
to
the
anticipatory
hum
of
the
insects
getting
into
bed
i
threw
a
propitiatory
prayer
in
their
general
direction
a
half
hour
later
i
coughed
pretentiously
to
attract
my
guru
attention
i
thought
i
would
go
mad
with
the
bites
and
especially
the
singing
drone
as
the
mosquitoes
celebrated
bloodthirsty
rites
no
responsive
stir
from
master
i
approached
him
cautiously
he
was
not
breathing
this
was
my
first
observation
of
him
in
the
yogic
trance
it
filled
me
with
fright
his
heart
must
have
failed
i
placed
a
mirror
under
his
nose
no
appeared
to
make
doubly
certain
for
minutes
i
closed
his
mouth
and
nostrils
with
my
fingers
his
body
was
cold
and
motionless
in
a
daze
i
turned
toward
the
door
to
summon
help
so
a
budding
experimentalist
my
poor
nose
master
voice
was
shaky
with
laughter
why
do
you
go
to
bed
is
the
whole
world
going
to
change
for
you
change
yourself
be
rid
of
the
mosquito
consciousness
meekly
i
returned
to
my
bed
not
one
insect
ventured
near
i
realized
that
my
guru
had
previously
agreed
to
the
curtains
only
to
please
me
he
had
no
fear
of
mosquitoes
his
yogic
power
was
such
that
he
either
could
will
them
not
to
bite
or
could
escape
to
an
inner
invulnerability
he
was
giving
me
a
demonstration
i
thought
that
is
the
yogic
state
i
must
strive
to
attain
a
yogi
must
be
able
to
pass
into
and
continue
in
the
superconsciousness
regardless
of
multitudinous
distractions
never
absent
from
this
earth
whether
in
the
buzz
of
insects
or
the
pervasive
glare
of
daylight
the
testimony
of
the
senses
must
be
barred
sound
and
sight
come
then
indeed
but
to
worlds
fairer
than
the
banished
eden
the
instructive
mosquitoes
served
for
another
early
lesson
at
the
ashram
it
was
the
gentle
hour
of
dusk
my
guru
was
matchlessly
interpreting
the
ancient
texts
at
his
feet
i
was
in
perfect
peace
a
rude
mosquito
entered
the
idyl
and
competed
for
my
attention
as
it
dug
a
poisonous
hypodermic
needle
into
my
thigh
i
automatically
raised
an
avenging
hand
reprieve
from
impending
execution
an
opportune
memory
came
to
me
of
one
of
patanjali
yoga
on
ahimsa
harmlessness
why
did
you
finish
the
job
master
do
you
advocate
taking
life
no
but
the
deathblow
already
had
been
struck
in
your
mind
i
do
understand
patanjali
meaning
was
the
removal
of
desire
to
kill
sri
yukteswar
had
found
my
mental
processes
an
open
book
this
world
is
inconveniently
arranged
for
a
literal
practice
of
ahimsa
man
may
be
compelled
to
exterminate
harmful
creatures
he
is
not
under
similar
compulsion
to
feel
anger
or
animosity
all
forms
of
life
have
equal
right
to
the
air
of
maya
the
saint
who
uncovers
the
secret
of
creation
will
be
in
harmony
with
its
countless
bewildering
expressions
all
men
may
approach
that
understanding
who
curb
the
inner
passion
for
destruction
guruji
should
one
offer
himself
a
sacrifice
rather
than
kill
a
wild
beast
no
man
body
is
precious
it
has
the
highest
evolutionary
value
because
of
unique
brain
and
spinal
centers
these
enable
the
advanced
devotee
to
fully
grasp
and
express
the
loftiest
aspects
of
divinity
no
lower
form
is
so
equipped
it
is
true
that
one
incurs
the
debt
of
a
minor
sin
if
he
is
forced
to
kill
an
animal
or
any
living
thing
but
the
vedas
teach
that
wanton
loss
of
a
human
body
is
a
serious
transgression
against
the
karmic
law
i
sighed
in
relief
scriptural
reinforcement
of
one
natural
instincts
is
not
always
forthcoming
it
so
happened
that
i
never
saw
master
at
close
quarters
with
a
leopard
or
a
tiger
but
a
deadly
cobra
once
confronted
him
only
to
be
conquered
by
my
guru
love
this
variety
of
snake
is
much
feared
in
india
where
it
causes
more
than
five
thousand
deaths
annually
the
dangerous
encounter
took
place
at
puri
where
sri
yukteswar
had
a
second
hermitage
charmingly
situated
near
the
bay
of
bengal
prafulla
a
young
disciple
of
later
years
was
with
master
on
this
occasion
we
were
seated
outdoors
near
the
ashram
prafulla
told
me
a
cobra
appeared
a
length
of
sheer
terror
its
hood
was
angrily
expanded
as
it
raced
toward
us
my
guru
gave
a
welcoming
chuckle
as
though
to
a
child
i
was
beside
myself
with
consternation
to
see
master
engage
in
a
rhythmical
clapping
of
hands
he
was
entertaining
the
dread
visitor
i
remained
absolutely
quiet
inwardly
ejaculating
what
fervent
prayers
i
could
muster
the
serpent
very
close
to
my
guru
was
now
motionless
seemingly
magnetized
by
his
caressing
attitude
the
frightful
hood
gradually
contracted
the
snake
slithered
between
master
feet
and
disappeared
into
the
bushes
why
my
guru
would
move
his
hands
and
why
the
cobra
would
not
strike
them
were
inexplicable
to
me
then
prafulla
concluded
i
have
since
come
to
realize
that
my
divine
master
is
beyond
fear
of
hurt
from
any
living
creature
one
afternoon
during
my
early
months
at
the
ashram
found
sri
yukteswar
eyes
fixed
on
me
piercingly
you
are
too
thin
mukunda
his
remark
struck
a
sensitive
point
that
my
sunken
eyes
and
emaciated
appearance
were
far
from
my
liking
was
testified
to
by
rows
of
tonics
in
my
room
at
calcutta
nothing
availed
chronic
dyspepsia
had
pursued
me
since
childhood
my
despair
reached
an
occasional
zenith
when
i
asked
myself
if
it
were
to
carry
on
this
life
with
a
body
so
unsound
medicines
have
limitations
the
creative
has
none
believe
that
you
shall
be
well
and
strong
sri
yukteswar
words
aroused
a
conviction
of
truth
which
no
other
i
had
tried
many
been
able
to
summon
within
me
day
by
day
behold
i
waxed
two
weeks
after
master
hidden
blessing
i
had
accumulated
the
invigorating
weight
which
eluded
me
in
the
past
my
persistent
stomach
ailments
vanished
with
a
lifelong
permanency
on
later
occasions
i
witnessed
my
instantaneous
divine
healings
of
persons
suffering
from
ominous
diabetes
epilepsy
or
paralysis
not
one
could
have
been
more
grateful
for
his
cure
than
i
was
at
sudden
freedom
from
my
cadaverous
aspect
years
ago
i
too
was
anxious
to
put
on
weight
sri
yukteswar
told
me
during
convalescence
after
a
severe
illness
i
visited
lahiri
mahasaya
in
benares
i
have
been
very
sick
and
lost
many
pounds
see
yukteswar
you
made
yourself
unwell
and
now
you
think
you
are
thin
this
reply
was
far
from
the
one
i
had
expected
my
guru
however
added
encouragingly
me
see
i
am
sure
you
ought
to
feel
better
tomorrow
taking
his
words
as
a
gesture
of
secret
healing
toward
my
receptive
mind
i
was
not
surprised
the
next
morning
at
a
welcome
accession
of
strength
i
sought
out
my
master
and
exclaimed
exultingly
i
feel
much
better
today
today
you
invigorate
yourself
master
i
protested
was
you
who
helped
me
this
is
the
first
time
in
weeks
that
i
have
had
any
energy
yes
your
malady
has
been
quite
serious
your
body
is
frail
yet
who
can
say
how
it
will
be
tomorrow
the
thought
of
possible
return
of
my
weakness
brought
me
a
shudder
of
cold
fear
the
following
morning
i
could
hardly
drag
myself
to
lahiri
mahasaya
home
i
am
ailing
again
my
guru
glance
was
quizzical
once
more
you
indispose
yourself
i
realize
now
that
day
by
day
you
have
been
ridiculing
me
my
patience
was
exhausted
do
understand
why
you
disbelieve
my
truthful
reports
it
has
been
your
thoughts
that
have
made
you
feel
alternately
weak
and
strong
my
master
looked
at
me
affectionately
have
seen
how
your
health
has
exactly
followed
your
expectations
thought
is
a
force
even
as
electricity
or
gravitation
the
human
mind
is
a
spark
of
the
almighty
consciousness
of
god
i
could
show
you
that
whatever
your
powerful
mind
believes
very
intensely
would
instantly
come
to
pass
knowing
that
lahiri
mahasaya
never
spoke
idly
i
addressed
him
with
great
awe
and
gratitude
if
i
think
i
am
well
and
have
regained
my
former
weight
shall
that
happen
is
so
even
at
this
moment
my
guru
spoke
gravely
his
gaze
concentrated
on
my
eyes
lo
i
felt
an
increase
not
alone
of
strength
but
of
weight
lahiri
mahasaya
retreated
into
silence
after
a
few
hours
at
his
feet
i
returned
to
my
mother
home
where
i
stayed
during
my
visits
to
benares
son
what
is
the
matter
are
you
swelling
with
dropsy
mother
could
hardly
believe
her
eyes
my
body
was
now
of
the
same
robust
dimensions
it
had
possessed
before
my
illness
i
weighed
myself
and
found
that
in
one
day
i
had
gained
fifty
pounds
they
remained
with
me
permanently
friends
and
acquaintances
who
had
seen
my
thin
figure
were
aghast
with
wonderment
a
number
of
them
changed
their
mode
of
life
and
became
disciples
of
lahiri
mahasaya
as
a
result
of
this
miracle
my
guru
awake
in
god
knew
this
world
to
be
nothing
but
an
objectivized
dream
of
the
creator
because
he
was
completely
aware
of
his
unity
with
the
divine
dreamer
lahiri
mahasaya
could
materialize
or
dematerialize
or
make
any
change
he
wished
in
the
cosmic
vision
all
creation
is
governed
by
law
sri
yukteswar
concluded
the
ones
which
manifest
in
the
outer
universe
discoverable
by
scientists
are
called
natural
laws
but
there
are
subtler
laws
ruling
the
realms
of
consciousness
which
can
be
known
only
through
the
inner
science
of
yoga
the
hidden
spiritual
planes
also
have
their
natural
and
lawful
principles
of
operation
it
is
not
the
physical
scientist
but
the
fully
master
who
comprehends
the
true
nature
of
matter
thus
christ
was
able
to
restore
the
ear
after
it
had
been
severed
by
one
of
the
disciples
sri
yukteswar
was
a
peerless
interpreter
of
the
scriptures
many
of
my
happiest
memories
are
centered
in
his
discourses
but
his
jeweled
thoughts
were
not
cast
into
ashes
of
heedlessness
or
stupidity
one
restless
movement
of
my
body
or
my
slight
lapse
into
sufficed
to
put
an
abrupt
period
to
master
exposition
you
are
not
here
master
interrupted
himself
one
afternoon
with
this
disclosure
as
usual
he
was
keeping
track
of
my
attention
with
a
devastating
immediacy
guruji
my
tone
was
a
protest
i
have
not
stirred
my
eyelids
have
not
moved
i
can
repeat
each
word
you
have
uttered
nevertheless
you
were
not
fully
with
me
your
objection
forces
me
to
remark
that
in
your
mental
background
you
were
creating
three
institutions
one
was
a
sylvan
retreat
on
a
plain
another
on
a
hilltop
a
third
by
the
ocean
those
vaguely
formulated
thoughts
had
indeed
been
present
almost
subconsciously
i
glanced
at
him
apologetically
what
can
i
do
with
such
a
master
who
penetrates
my
random
musings
illustration
main
building
at
the
mount
washington
estates
in
los
angeles
established
in
as
american
headquarters
for
the
see
illustration
church
of
all
religions
hollywood
see
you
have
given
me
that
right
the
subtle
truths
i
am
expounding
can
not
be
grasped
without
your
complete
concentration
unless
necessary
i
do
not
invade
the
seclusion
of
others
minds
man
has
the
natural
privilege
of
roaming
secretly
among
his
thoughts
the
unbidden
lord
does
not
enter
there
neither
do
i
venture
intrusion
you
are
ever
welcome
master
your
architectural
dreams
will
materialize
later
now
is
the
time
for
study
thus
incidentally
my
guru
revealed
in
his
simple
way
the
coming
of
three
great
events
in
my
life
since
early
youth
i
had
had
enigmatic
glimpses
of
three
buildings
each
in
a
different
setting
in
the
exact
sequence
sri
yukteswar
had
indicated
these
visions
took
ultimate
form
first
came
my
founding
of
a
boys
yoga
school
on
a
ranchi
plain
then
my
american
headquarters
on
a
los
angeles
hilltop
finally
a
hermitage
in
southern
california
by
the
vast
pacific
master
never
arrogantly
asserted
i
prophesy
that
such
and
such
an
event
shall
occur
he
would
rather
hint
do
you
think
it
may
happen
but
his
simple
speech
hid
vatic
power
there
was
no
recanting
never
did
his
slightly
veiled
words
prove
false
sri
yukteswar
was
reserved
and
in
demeanor
there
was
naught
of
the
vague
or
daft
visionary
about
him
his
feet
were
firm
on
the
earth
his
head
in
the
haven
of
heaven
practical
people
aroused
his
admiration
saintliness
is
not
dumbness
divine
perceptions
are
not
incapacitating
he
would
say
the
active
expression
of
virtue
gives
rise
to
the
keenest
intelligence
in
master
life
i
fully
discovered
the
cleavage
between
spiritual
realism
and
the
obscure
mysticism
that
spuriously
passes
as
a
counterpart
my
guru
was
reluctant
to
discuss
the
superphysical
realms
his
only
marvelous
aura
was
one
of
perfect
simplicity
in
conversation
he
avoided
startling
references
in
action
he
was
freely
expressive
others
talked
of
miracles
but
could
manifest
nothing
sri
yukteswar
seldom
mentioned
the
subtle
laws
but
secretly
operated
them
at
will
a
man
of
realization
does
not
perform
any
miracle
until
he
receives
an
inward
sanction
master
explained
god
does
not
wish
the
secrets
of
his
creation
revealed
promiscuously
also
every
individual
in
the
world
has
inalienable
right
to
his
free
will
a
saint
will
not
encroach
upon
that
independence
the
silence
habitual
to
sri
yukteswar
was
caused
by
his
deep
perceptions
of
the
infinite
no
time
remained
for
the
interminable
revelations
that
occupy
the
days
of
teachers
without
in
shallow
men
the
fish
of
little
thoughts
cause
much
commotion
in
oceanic
minds
the
whales
of
inspiration
make
hardly
a
ruffle
this
observation
from
the
hindu
scriptures
is
not
without
discerning
humor
because
of
my
guru
unspectacular
guise
only
a
few
of
his
contemporaries
recognized
him
as
a
superman
the
popular
adage
he
is
a
fool
that
can
not
conceal
his
wisdom
could
never
be
applied
to
sri
yukteswar
though
born
a
mortal
like
all
others
master
had
achieved
identity
with
the
ruler
of
time
and
space
in
his
life
i
perceived
a
godlike
unity
he
had
not
found
any
insuperable
obstacle
to
mergence
of
human
with
divine
no
such
barrier
exists
i
came
to
understand
save
in
man
spiritual
unadventurousness
i
always
thrilled
at
the
touch
of
sri
yukteswar
holy
feet
yogis
teach
that
a
disciple
is
spiritually
magnetized
by
reverent
contact
with
a
master
a
subtle
current
is
generated
the
undesirable
in
the
brain
are
often
cauterized
the
groove
of
his
worldly
tendencies
beneficially
disturbed
momentarily
at
least
he
may
find
the
secret
veils
of
maya
lifting
and
glimpse
the
reality
of
bliss
my
whole
body
responded
with
a
liberating
glow
whenever
i
knelt
in
the
indian
fashion
before
my
guru
even
when
lahiri
mahasaya
was
silent
master
told
me
or
when
he
conversed
on
other
than
strictly
religious
topics
i
discovered
that
nonetheless
he
had
transmitted
to
me
ineffable
knowledge
sri
yukteswar
affected
me
similarly
if
i
entered
the
hermitage
in
a
worried
or
indifferent
frame
of
mind
my
attitude
imperceptibly
changed
a
healing
calm
descended
at
mere
sight
of
my
guru
every
day
with
him
was
a
new
experience
in
joy
peace
and
wisdom
never
did
i
find
him
deluded
or
intoxicated
with
greed
or
emotion
or
anger
or
any
human
attachment
the
darkness
of
maya
is
silently
approaching
let
us
hie
homeward
within
with
these
words
at
dusk
master
constantly
reminded
his
disciples
of
their
need
for
kriya
yoga
a
new
student
occasionally
expressed
doubts
regarding
his
own
worthiness
to
engage
in
yoga
practice
forget
the
past
sri
yukteswar
would
console
him
the
vanished
lives
of
all
men
are
dark
with
many
shames
human
conduct
is
ever
unreliable
until
anchored
in
the
divine
everything
in
future
will
improve
if
you
are
making
a
spiritual
effort
now
master
always
had
young
chelas
in
his
hermitage
their
spiritual
and
intellectual
education
was
his
lifelong
interest
even
shortly
before
he
passed
on
he
accepted
for
training
two
boys
and
one
youth
of
sixteen
he
directed
their
minds
and
lives
with
that
careful
discipline
in
which
the
word
disciple
is
etymologically
rooted
the
ashram
residents
loved
and
revered
their
guru
a
slight
clap
of
his
hands
sufficed
to
bring
them
eagerly
to
his
side
when
his
mood
was
silent
and
withdrawn
no
one
ventured
to
speak
when
his
laugh
rang
jovially
children
looked
upon
him
as
their
own
master
seldom
asked
others
to
render
him
a
personal
service
nor
would
he
accept
help
from
a
student
unless
the
willingness
were
sincere
my
guru
quietly
washed
his
clothes
if
the
disciples
overlooked
that
privileged
task
sri
yukteswar
wore
the
traditional
swami
robe
his
laceless
shoes
in
accordance
with
yogi
custom
were
of
tiger
or
deer
skin
master
spoke
fluent
english
french
hindi
and
bengali
his
sanskrit
was
fair
he
patiently
instructed
his
young
disciples
by
certain
short
cuts
which
he
had
ingeniously
devised
for
the
study
of
english
and
sanskrit
master
was
cautious
of
his
body
while
withholding
solicitous
attachment
the
infinite
he
pointed
out
properly
manifests
through
physical
and
mental
soundness
he
discountenanced
any
extremes
a
disciple
once
started
a
long
fast
my
guru
only
laughed
why
not
throw
the
dog
a
bone
sri
yukteswar
health
was
excellent
i
never
saw
him
unwell
he
permitted
students
to
consult
doctors
if
it
seemed
advisable
his
purpose
was
to
give
respect
to
the
worldly
custom
physicians
must
carry
on
their
work
of
healing
through
god
laws
as
applied
to
matter
but
he
extolled
the
superiority
of
mental
therapy
and
often
repeated
wisdom
is
the
greatest
cleanser
the
body
is
a
treacherous
friend
give
it
its
due
no
more
he
said
pain
and
pleasure
are
transitory
endure
all
dualities
with
calmness
while
trying
at
the
same
time
to
remove
their
hold
imagination
is
the
door
through
which
disease
as
well
as
healing
enters
disbelieve
in
the
reality
of
sickness
even
when
you
are
ill
an
unrecognized
visitor
will
flee
master
numbered
many
doctors
among
his
disciples
those
who
have
ferreted
out
the
physical
laws
can
easily
investigate
the
science
of
the
soul
he
told
them
a
subtle
spiritual
mechanism
is
hidden
just
behind
the
bodily
structure
sri
yukteswar
counseled
his
students
to
be
living
liaisons
of
western
and
eastern
virtues
himself
an
executive
occidental
in
outer
habits
inwardly
he
was
the
spiritual
oriental
he
praised
the
progressive
resourceful
and
hygienic
habits
of
the
west
and
the
religious
ideals
which
give
a
centuried
halo
to
the
east
discipline
had
not
been
unknown
to
me
at
home
father
was
strict
ananta
often
severe
but
sri
yukteswar
training
can
not
be
described
as
other
than
drastic
a
perfectionist
my
guru
was
hypercritical
of
his
disciples
whether
in
matters
of
moment
or
in
the
subtle
nuances
of
behavior
good
manners
without
sincerity
are
like
a
beautiful
dead
lady
he
remarked
on
suitable
occasion
straightforwardness
without
civility
is
like
a
surgeon
knife
effective
but
unpleasant
candor
with
courtesy
is
helpful
and
admirable
master
was
apparently
satisfied
with
my
spiritual
progress
for
he
seldom
referred
to
it
in
other
matters
my
ears
were
no
strangers
to
reproof
my
chief
offenses
were
absentmindedness
intermittent
indulgence
in
sad
moods
of
certain
rules
of
etiquette
and
occasional
unmethodical
ways
observe
how
the
activities
of
your
father
bhagabati
are
and
balanced
in
every
way
my
guru
pointed
out
the
two
disciples
of
lahiri
mahasaya
had
met
soon
after
i
began
my
pilgrimages
to
serampore
father
and
sri
yukteswar
admiringly
evaluated
the
other
worth
both
had
built
an
inner
life
of
spiritual
granite
insoluble
against
the
ages
from
transient
teachers
of
my
earlier
life
i
had
imbibed
a
few
erroneous
lessons
a
chela
i
was
told
need
not
concern
himself
strenuously
over
worldly
duties
when
i
had
neglected
or
carelessly
performed
my
tasks
i
was
not
chastised
human
nature
finds
such
instruction
very
easy
of
assimilation
under
master
unsparing
rod
however
i
soon
recovered
from
the
agreeable
delusions
of
irresponsibility
those
who
are
too
good
for
this
world
are
adorning
some
other
sri
yukteswar
remarked
so
long
as
you
breathe
the
free
air
of
earth
you
are
under
obligation
to
render
grateful
service
he
alone
who
has
fully
mastered
the
breathless
state
is
freed
from
cosmic
imperatives
i
will
not
fail
to
let
you
know
when
you
have
attained
the
final
perfection
my
guru
could
never
be
bribed
even
by
love
he
showed
no
leniency
to
anyone
who
like
myself
willingly
offered
to
be
his
disciple
whether
master
and
i
were
surrounded
by
his
students
or
by
strangers
or
were
alone
together
he
always
spoke
plainly
and
upbraided
sharply
no
trifling
lapse
into
shallowness
or
inconsistency
escaped
his
rebuke
this
flattening
treatment
was
hard
to
endure
but
my
resolve
was
to
allow
sri
yukteswar
to
iron
out
each
of
my
psychological
kinks
as
he
labored
at
this
titanic
transformation
i
shook
many
times
under
the
weight
of
his
disciplinary
hammer
if
you
do
like
my
words
you
are
at
liberty
to
leave
at
any
time
master
assured
me
i
want
nothing
from
you
but
your
own
improvement
stay
only
if
you
feel
benefited
for
every
humbling
blow
he
dealt
my
vanity
for
every
tooth
in
my
metaphorical
jaw
he
knocked
loose
with
stunning
aim
i
am
grateful
beyond
any
facility
of
expression
the
hard
core
of
human
egotism
is
hardly
to
be
dislodged
except
rudely
with
its
departure
the
divine
finds
at
last
an
unobstructed
channel
in
vain
it
seeks
to
percolate
through
flinty
hearts
of
selfishness
sri
yukteswar
wisdom
was
so
penetrating
that
heedless
of
remarks
he
often
replied
to
one
unspoken
observation
what
a
person
imagines
he
hears
and
what
the
speaker
has
really
implied
may
be
poles
apart
he
said
try
to
feel
the
thoughts
behind
the
confusion
of
men
verbiage
but
divine
insight
is
painful
to
worldly
ears
master
was
not
popular
with
superficial
students
the
wise
always
few
in
number
deeply
revered
him
i
daresay
sri
yukteswar
would
have
been
the
most
soughtafter
guru
in
india
had
his
words
not
been
so
candid
and
so
censorious
i
am
hard
on
those
who
come
for
my
training
he
admitted
to
me
that
is
my
way
take
it
or
leave
it
i
will
never
compromise
but
you
will
be
much
kinder
to
your
disciples
that
is
your
way
i
try
to
purify
only
in
the
fires
of
severity
searing
beyond
the
average
toleration
the
gentle
approach
of
love
is
also
transfiguring
the
inflexible
and
the
yielding
methods
are
equally
effective
if
applied
with
wisdom
you
will
go
to
foreign
lands
where
blunt
assaults
on
the
ego
are
not
appreciated
a
teacher
could
not
spread
message
in
the
west
without
an
ample
fund
of
accommodative
patience
and
forbearance
i
refuse
to
state
the
amount
of
truth
i
later
came
to
find
in
master
words
though
sri
yukteswar
undissembling
speech
prevented
a
large
following
during
his
years
on
earth
nevertheless
his
living
spirit
manifests
today
over
the
world
through
sincere
students
of
his
kriya
yoga
and
other
teachings
he
has
further
dominion
in
souls
than
ever
alexander
dreamed
of
in
the
soil
father
arrived
one
day
to
pay
his
respects
to
sri
yukteswar
my
parent
expected
very
likely
to
hear
some
words
in
my
praise
he
was
shocked
to
be
given
a
long
account
of
my
imperfections
it
was
master
practice
to
recount
simple
negligible
shortcomings
with
an
air
of
portentous
gravity
father
rushed
to
see
me
from
your
guru
remarks
i
thought
to
find
you
a
complete
wreck
my
parent
was
between
tears
and
laughter
the
only
cause
of
sri
yukteswar
displeasure
at
the
time
was
that
i
had
been
trying
against
his
gentle
hint
to
convert
a
certain
man
to
the
spiritual
path
with
indignant
speed
i
sought
out
my
guru
he
received
me
with
downcast
eyes
as
though
conscious
of
guilt
it
was
the
only
time
i
ever
saw
the
divine
lion
meek
before
me
the
unique
moment
was
savored
to
the
full
sir
why
did
you
judge
me
so
mercilessly
before
my
astounded
father
was
that
just
i
will
not
do
it
again
master
tone
was
apologetic
instantly
i
was
disarmed
how
readily
the
great
man
admitted
his
fault
though
he
never
again
upset
father
peace
of
mind
master
relentlessly
continued
to
dissect
me
whenever
and
wherever
he
chose
new
disciples
often
joined
sri
yukteswar
in
exhaustive
criticism
of
others
wise
like
the
guru
models
of
flawless
discrimination
but
he
who
takes
the
offensive
must
not
be
defenseless
the
same
carping
students
fled
precipitantly
as
soon
as
master
publicly
unloosed
in
their
direction
a
few
shafts
from
his
analytical
quiver
tender
inner
weaknesses
revolting
at
mild
touches
of
censure
are
like
diseased
parts
of
the
body
recoiling
before
even
delicate
handling
this
was
sri
yukteswar
amused
comment
on
the
flighty
ones
there
are
disciples
who
seek
a
guru
made
in
their
own
image
such
students
often
complained
that
they
did
not
understand
sri
yukteswar
neither
do
you
comprehend
god
i
retorted
on
one
occasion
when
a
saint
is
clear
to
you
you
will
be
one
among
the
trillion
mysteries
breathing
every
second
the
inexplicable
air
who
may
venture
to
ask
that
the
fathomless
nature
of
a
master
be
instantly
grasped
students
came
and
generally
went
those
who
craved
a
path
of
oily
sympathy
and
comfortable
recognitions
did
not
find
it
at
the
hermitage
master
offered
shelter
and
shepherding
for
the
aeons
but
many
disciples
miserly
demanded
as
well
they
departed
preferring
life
countless
humiliations
before
any
humility
master
blazing
rays
the
open
penetrating
sunshine
of
his
wisdom
were
too
powerful
for
their
spiritual
sickness
they
sought
some
lesser
teacher
who
shading
them
with
flattery
permitted
the
fitful
sleep
of
ignorance
during
my
early
months
with
master
i
had
experienced
a
sensitive
fear
of
his
reprimands
these
were
reserved
i
soon
saw
for
disciples
who
had
asked
for
his
verbal
vivisection
if
any
writhing
student
made
a
protest
sri
yukteswar
would
become
unoffendedly
silent
his
words
were
never
wrathful
but
impersonal
with
wisdom
master
insight
was
not
for
the
unprepared
ears
of
casual
visitors
he
seldom
remarked
on
their
defects
even
if
conspicuous
but
toward
students
who
sought
his
counsel
sri
yukteswar
felt
a
serious
responsibility
brave
indeed
is
the
guru
who
undertakes
to
transform
the
crude
ore
of
humanity
a
saint
courage
roots
in
his
compassion
for
the
stumbling
eyeless
of
this
world
when
i
had
abandoned
underlying
resentment
i
found
a
marked
decrease
in
my
chastisement
in
a
very
subtle
way
master
melted
into
comparative
clemency
in
time
i
demolished
every
wall
of
rationalization
and
subconscious
reservation
behind
which
the
human
personality
generally
shields
itself
the
reward
was
an
effortless
harmony
with
my
guru
i
discovered
him
then
to
be
trusting
considerate
and
silently
loving
undemonstrative
however
he
bestowed
no
word
of
affection
my
own
temperament
is
principally
devotional
it
was
disconcerting
at
first
to
find
that
my
guru
saturated
with
jnana
but
seemingly
dry
of
bhakti
expressed
himself
only
in
terms
of
cold
spiritual
mathematics
but
as
i
tuned
myself
to
his
nature
i
discovered
no
diminution
but
rather
increase
in
my
devotional
approach
to
god
a
master
is
fully
able
to
guide
his
various
disciples
along
natural
lines
of
their
essential
bias
my
relationship
with
sri
yukteswar
somewhat
inarticulate
nonetheless
possessed
all
eloquence
often
i
found
his
silent
signature
on
my
thoughts
rendering
speech
inutile
quietly
sitting
beside
him
i
felt
his
bounty
pouring
peacefully
over
my
being
sri
yukteswar
impartial
justice
was
notably
demonstrated
during
the
summer
vacation
of
my
first
college
year
i
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
spend
uninterrupted
months
at
serampore
with
my
guru
you
may
be
in
charge
of
the
hermitage
master
was
pleased
over
my
enthusiastic
arrival
your
duties
will
be
the
reception
of
guests
and
supervision
of
the
work
of
the
other
disciples
kumar
a
young
villager
from
east
bengal
was
accepted
a
fortnight
later
for
hermitage
training
remarkably
intelligent
he
quickly
won
sri
yukteswar
affection
for
some
unfathomable
reason
master
was
very
lenient
to
the
new
resident
mukunda
let
kumar
assume
your
duties
employ
your
own
time
in
sweeping
and
cooking
master
issued
these
instructions
after
the
new
boy
had
been
with
us
for
a
month
exalted
to
leadership
kumar
exercised
a
petty
household
tyranny
in
silent
mutiny
the
other
disciples
continued
to
seek
me
out
for
daily
counsel
mukunda
is
impossible
you
made
me
supervisor
yet
the
others
go
to
him
and
obey
him
three
weeks
later
kumar
was
complaining
to
our
guru
i
overheard
him
from
an
adjoining
room
that
why
i
assigned
him
to
the
kitchen
and
you
to
the
parlor
sri
yukteswar
withering
tones
were
new
to
kumar
in
this
way
you
have
come
to
realize
that
a
worthy
leader
has
the
desire
to
serve
and
not
to
dominate
you
wanted
mukunda
position
but
could
not
maintain
it
by
merit
return
now
to
your
earlier
work
as
assistant
after
this
humbling
incident
master
resumed
toward
kumar
a
former
attitude
of
unwonted
indulgence
who
can
solve
the
mystery
of
attraction
in
kumar
our
guru
discovered
a
charming
fount
which
did
not
spurt
for
the
fellow
disciples
though
the
new
boy
was
obviously
sri
yukteswar
favorite
i
felt
no
dismay
personal
idiosyncrasies
possessed
even
by
masters
lend
a
rich
complexity
to
the
pattern
of
life
my
nature
is
seldom
commandeered
by
a
detail
i
was
seeking
from
sri
yukteswar
a
more
inaccessible
benefit
than
an
outward
praise
kumar
spoke
venomously
to
me
one
day
without
reason
i
was
deeply
hurt
your
head
is
swelling
to
the
bursting
point
i
added
a
warning
whose
truth
i
felt
intuitively
unless
you
mend
your
ways
someday
you
will
be
asked
to
leave
this
ashram
laughing
sarcastically
kumar
repeated
my
remark
to
our
guru
who
had
just
entered
the
room
fully
expecting
to
be
scolded
i
retired
meekly
to
a
corner
maybe
mukunda
is
right
master
reply
to
the
boy
came
with
unusual
coldness
i
escaped
without
castigation
a
year
later
kumar
set
out
for
a
visit
to
his
childhood
home
he
ignored
the
quiet
disapproval
of
sri
yukteswar
who
never
authoritatively
controlled
his
disciples
movements
on
the
return
to
serampore
in
a
few
months
a
change
was
unpleasantly
apparent
gone
was
the
stately
kumar
with
serenely
glowing
face
only
an
undistinguished
peasant
stood
before
us
one
who
had
lately
acquired
a
number
of
evil
habits
master
summoned
me
and
brokenheartedly
discussed
the
fact
that
the
boy
was
now
unsuited
to
the
monastic
hermitage
life
mukunda
i
will
leave
it
to
you
to
instruct
kumar
to
leave
the
ashram
tomorrow
i
ca
do
it
tears
stood
in
sri
eyes
but
he
controlled
himself
quickly
the
boy
would
never
have
fallen
to
these
depths
had
he
listened
to
me
and
not
gone
away
to
mix
with
undesirable
companions
he
has
rejected
my
protection
the
callous
world
must
be
his
guru
still
kumar
departure
brought
me
no
elation
sadly
i
wondered
how
one
with
power
to
win
a
master
love
could
ever
respond
to
cheaper
allures
enjoyment
of
wine
and
sex
are
rooted
in
the
natural
man
and
require
no
delicacies
of
perception
for
their
appreciation
sense
wiles
are
comparable
to
the
evergreen
oleander
fragrant
with
its
multicolored
flowers
every
part
of
the
plant
is
poisonous
the
land
of
healing
lies
within
radiant
with
that
happiness
blindly
sought
in
a
thousand
misdirections
keen
intelligence
is
master
once
remarked
in
reference
to
kumar
brilliant
mind
it
may
be
used
constructively
or
destructively
like
a
knife
either
to
cut
the
boil
of
ignorance
or
to
decapitate
one
self
intelligence
is
rightly
guided
only
after
the
mind
has
acknowledged
the
inescapability
of
spiritual
law
my
guru
mixed
freely
with
men
and
women
disciples
treating
all
as
his
children
perceiving
their
soul
equality
he
showed
no
distinction
or
partiality
in
sleep
you
do
not
know
whether
you
are
a
man
or
a
woman
he
said
just
as
a
man
impersonating
a
woman
does
not
become
one
so
the
soul
impersonating
both
man
and
woman
has
no
sex
the
soul
is
the
pure
changeless
image
of
god
sri
yukteswar
never
avoided
or
blamed
women
as
objects
of
seduction
men
he
said
were
also
a
temptation
to
women
i
once
inquired
of
my
guru
why
a
great
ancient
saint
had
called
women
the
door
to
hell
a
girl
must
have
proved
very
troublesome
to
his
peace
of
mind
in
his
early
life
my
guru
answered
causticly
otherwise
he
would
have
denounced
not
woman
but
some
imperfection
in
his
own
if
a
visitor
dared
to
relate
a
suggestive
story
in
the
hermitage
master
would
maintain
an
unresponsive
silence
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
thrashed
by
the
provoking
whip
of
a
beautiful
face
he
told
the
disciples
how
can
sense
slaves
enjoy
the
world
its
subtle
flavors
escape
them
while
they
grovel
in
primal
mud
all
nice
discriminations
are
lost
to
the
man
of
elemental
lusts
students
seeking
to
escape
from
the
dualistic
maya
delusion
received
from
sri
yukteswar
patient
and
understanding
counsel
just
as
the
purpose
of
eating
is
to
satisfy
hunger
not
greed
so
the
sex
instinct
is
designed
for
the
propagation
of
the
species
according
to
natural
law
never
for
the
kindling
of
insatiable
longings
he
said
destroy
wrong
desires
now
otherwise
they
will
follow
you
after
the
astral
body
is
torn
from
its
physical
casing
even
when
the
flesh
is
weak
the
mind
should
be
constantly
resistant
if
temptation
assails
you
with
cruel
force
overcome
it
by
impersonal
analysis
and
indomitable
will
every
natural
passion
can
be
mastered
conserve
your
powers
be
like
the
capacious
ocean
absorbing
within
all
the
tributary
rivers
of
the
senses
small
yearnings
are
openings
in
the
reservoir
of
your
inner
peace
permitting
healing
waters
to
be
wasted
in
the
desert
soil
of
materialism
the
forceful
activating
impulse
of
wrong
desire
is
the
greatest
enemy
to
the
happiness
of
man
roam
in
the
world
as
a
lion
of
see
that
the
frogs
of
weakness
do
kick
you
around
the
devotee
is
finally
freed
from
all
instinctive
compulsions
he
transforms
his
need
for
human
affection
into
aspiration
for
god
alone
a
love
solitary
because
omnipresent
sri
yukteswar
mother
lived
in
the
rana
mahal
district
of
benares
where
i
had
first
visited
my
guru
gracious
and
kindly
she
was
yet
a
woman
of
very
decided
opinions
i
stood
on
her
balcony
one
day
and
watched
mother
and
son
talking
together
in
his
quiet
sensible
way
master
was
trying
to
convince
her
about
something
he
was
apparently
unsuccessful
for
she
shook
her
head
with
great
vigor
nay
nay
my
son
go
away
now
your
wise
words
are
not
for
me
i
am
not
your
disciple
sri
yukteswar
backed
away
without
further
argument
like
a
scolded
child
i
was
touched
at
his
great
respect
for
his
mother
even
in
her
unreasonable
moods
she
saw
him
only
as
her
little
boy
not
as
a
sage
there
was
a
charm
about
the
trifling
incident
it
supplied
a
sidelight
on
my
guru
unusual
nature
inwardly
humble
and
outwardly
unbendable
the
monastic
regulations
do
not
allow
a
swami
to
retain
connection
with
worldly
ties
after
their
formal
severance
he
can
not
perform
the
ceremonial
family
rites
which
are
obligatory
on
the
householder
yet
shankara
the
ancient
founder
of
the
swami
order
disregarded
the
injunctions
at
the
death
of
his
beloved
mother
he
cremated
her
body
with
heavenly
fire
which
he
caused
to
spurt
from
his
upraised
hand
sri
yukteswar
also
ignored
the
restrictions
in
a
fashion
less
spectacular
when
his
mother
passed
on
he
arranged
the
crematory
services
by
the
holy
ganges
in
benares
and
fed
many
brahmins
in
conformance
with
custom
the
shastric
prohibitions
were
intended
to
help
swamis
overcome
narrow
identifications
shankara
and
sri
yukteswar
had
wholly
merged
their
beings
in
the
impersonal
spirit
they
needed
no
rescue
by
rule
sometimes
too
a
master
purposely
ignores
a
canon
in
order
to
uphold
its
principle
as
superior
to
and
independent
of
form
thus
jesus
plucked
ears
of
corn
on
the
day
of
rest
to
the
inevitable
critics
he
said
the
sabbath
was
made
for
man
and
not
man
for
the
sabbath
outside
of
the
scriptures
seldom
was
a
book
honored
by
sri
yukteswar
perusal
yet
he
was
invariably
acquainted
with
the
latest
scientific
discoveries
and
other
advancements
of
knowledge
a
brilliant
conversationalist
he
enjoyed
an
exchange
of
views
on
countless
topics
with
his
guests
my
guru
ready
wit
and
rollicking
laugh
enlivened
every
discussion
often
grave
master
was
never
gloomy
to
seek
the
lord
one
need
not
disfigure
his
face
he
would
remark
remember
that
finding
god
will
mean
the
funeral
of
all
sorrows
among
the
philosophers
professors
lawyers
and
scientists
who
came
to
the
hermitage
a
number
arrived
for
their
first
visit
with
the
expectation
of
meeting
an
orthodox
religionist
a
supercilious
smile
or
a
glance
of
amused
tolerance
occasionally
betrayed
that
the
newcomers
anticipated
nothing
more
than
a
few
pious
platitudes
yet
their
reluctant
departure
would
bring
an
expressed
conviction
that
sri
yukteswar
had
shown
precise
insight
into
their
specialized
fields
my
guru
ordinarily
was
gentle
and
affable
to
guests
his
welcome
was
given
with
charming
cordiality
yet
inveterate
egotists
sometimes
suffered
an
invigorating
shock
they
confronted
in
master
either
a
frigid
indifference
or
a
formidable
opposition
ice
or
iron
a
noted
chemist
once
crossed
swords
with
sri
yukteswar
the
visitor
would
not
admit
the
existence
of
god
inasmuch
as
science
has
devised
no
means
of
detecting
him
so
you
have
inexplicably
failed
to
isolate
the
supreme
power
in
your
test
tubes
master
gaze
was
stern
i
recommend
an
experiment
examine
your
thoughts
unremittingly
for
hours
then
wonder
no
longer
at
god
absence
a
celebrated
pundit
received
a
similar
jolt
with
ostentatious
zeal
the
scholar
shook
the
ashram
rafters
with
scriptural
lore
resounding
passages
poured
from
the
mahabharata
the
upanishads
the
bhasyas
of
shankara
i
am
waiting
to
hear
you
sri
yukteswar
tone
was
inquiring
as
though
utter
silence
had
reigned
the
pundit
was
puzzled
quotations
there
have
been
in
superabundance
master
words
convulsed
me
with
mirth
as
i
squatted
in
my
corner
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
visitor
but
what
original
commentary
can
you
supply
from
the
uniqueness
of
your
particular
life
what
holy
text
have
you
absorbed
and
made
your
own
in
what
ways
have
these
timeless
truths
renovated
your
nature
are
you
content
to
be
a
hollow
victrola
mechanically
repeating
the
words
of
other
men
i
give
up
the
scholar
chagrin
was
comical
i
have
no
inner
realization
for
the
first
time
perhaps
he
understood
that
discerning
placement
of
the
comma
does
not
atone
for
a
spiritual
coma
these
bloodless
pedants
smell
unduly
of
the
lamp
my
guru
remarked
after
the
departure
of
the
chastened
one
they
prefer
philosophy
to
be
a
gentle
intellectual
exercise
their
elevated
thoughts
are
carefully
unrelated
either
to
the
crudity
of
outward
action
or
to
any
scourging
inner
discipline
master
stressed
on
other
occasions
the
futility
of
mere
book
learning
do
not
confuse
understanding
with
a
larger
vocabulary
he
remarked
sacred
writings
are
beneficial
in
stimulating
desire
for
inward
realization
if
one
stanza
at
a
time
is
slowly
assimilated
continual
intellectual
study
results
in
vanity
and
the
false
satisfaction
of
an
undigested
knowledge
sri
yukteswar
related
one
of
his
own
experiences
in
scriptural
edification
the
scene
was
a
forest
hermitage
in
eastern
bengal
where
he
observed
the
procedure
of
a
renowned
teacher
dabru
ballav
his
method
at
once
simple
and
difficult
was
common
in
ancient
india
dabru
ballav
had
gathered
his
disciples
around
him
in
the
sylvan
solitudes
the
holy
bhagavad
gita
was
open
before
them
steadfastly
they
looked
at
one
passage
for
half
an
hour
then
closed
their
eyes
another
half
hour
slipped
away
the
master
gave
a
brief
comment
motionless
they
meditated
again
for
an
hour
finally
the
guru
spoke
have
you
understood
yes
sir
one
in
the
group
ventured
this
assertion
no
not
fully
seek
the
spiritual
vitality
that
has
given
these
words
the
power
to
rejuvenate
india
century
after
century
another
hour
disappeared
in
silence
the
master
dismissed
the
students
and
turned
to
sri
yukteswar
do
you
know
the
bhagavad
gita
no
sir
not
really
though
my
eyes
and
mind
have
run
through
its
pages
many
times
thousands
have
replied
to
me
differently
the
great
sage
smiled
at
master
in
blessing
if
one
busies
himself
with
an
outer
display
of
scriptural
wealth
what
time
is
left
for
silent
inward
diving
after
the
priceless
pearls
sri
yukteswar
directed
the
study
of
his
own
disciples
by
the
same
intensive
method
of
wisdom
is
not
assimilated
with
the
eyes
but
with
the
atoms
he
said
when
your
conviction
of
a
truth
is
not
merely
in
your
brain
but
in
your
being
you
may
diffidently
vouch
for
its
meaning
he
discouraged
any
tendency
a
student
might
have
to
construe
as
a
necessary
step
to
spiritual
realization
the
rishis
wrote
in
one
sentence
profundities
that
commentating
scholars
busy
themselves
over
for
generations
he
remarked
endless
literary
controversy
is
for
sluggard
minds
what
more
liberating
thought
than
but
man
does
not
easily
return
to
simplicity
it
is
seldom
god
for
him
but
rather
learned
pomposities
his
ego
is
pleased
that
he
can
grasp
such
erudition
men
who
were
pridefully
conscious
of
high
worldly
position
were
likely
in
master
presence
to
add
humility
to
their
other
possessions
a
local
magistrate
once
arrived
for
an
interview
at
the
seaside
hermitage
in
puri
the
man
who
held
a
reputation
for
ruthlessness
had
it
well
within
his
power
to
oust
us
from
the
ashram
i
cautioned
my
guru
about
the
despotic
possibilities
but
he
seated
himself
with
an
uncompromising
air
and
did
not
rise
to
greet
the
visitor
slightly
nervous
i
squatted
near
the
door
the
man
had
to
content
himself
with
a
wooden
box
my
guru
did
not
request
me
to
fetch
a
chair
there
was
no
fulfillment
of
the
magistrate
obvious
expectation
that
his
importance
would
be
ceremoniously
acknowledged
a
metaphysical
discussion
ensued
the
guest
blundered
through
misinterpretations
of
the
scriptures
as
his
accuracy
sank
his
ire
rose
do
you
know
that
i
stood
first
in
the
a
examination
reason
had
forsaken
him
but
he
could
still
shout
magistrate
you
forget
that
this
is
not
your
courtroom
master
replied
evenly
from
your
childish
remarks
i
would
have
surmised
that
your
college
career
was
unremarkable
a
university
degree
in
any
case
is
not
remotely
related
to
vedic
realization
saints
are
not
produced
in
batches
every
semester
like
accountants
after
a
stunned
silence
the
visitor
laughed
heartily
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
a
heavenly
magistrate
he
said
later
he
made
a
formal
request
couched
in
the
legal
terms
which
were
evidently
part
and
parcel
of
his
being
to
be
accepted
as
a
probationary
disciple
my
guru
personally
attended
to
the
details
connected
with
the
management
of
his
property
unscrupulous
persons
on
various
occasions
attempted
to
secure
possession
of
master
ancestral
land
with
determination
and
even
by
instigating
lawsuits
sri
yukteswar
outwitted
every
opponent
he
underwent
these
painful
experiences
from
a
desire
never
to
be
a
begging
guru
or
a
burden
on
his
disciples
his
financial
independence
was
one
reason
why
my
alarmingly
outspoken
master
was
innocent
of
the
cunnings
of
diplomacy
unlike
those
teachers
who
have
to
flatter
their
supporters
my
guru
was
impervious
to
the
influences
open
or
subtle
of
others
wealth
never
did
i
hear
him
ask
or
even
hint
for
money
for
any
purpose
his
hermitage
training
was
given
free
and
freely
to
all
disciples
an
insolent
court
deputy
arrived
one
day
at
the
serampore
ashram
to
serve
sri
yukteswar
with
a
legal
summons
a
disciple
named
kanai
and
myself
were
also
present
the
officer
attitude
toward
master
was
offensive
it
will
do
you
good
to
leave
the
shadows
of
your
hermitage
and
breathe
the
honest
air
of
a
courtroom
the
deputy
grinned
contemptuously
i
could
not
contain
myself
another
word
of
your
impudence
and
you
will
be
on
the
floor
i
advanced
threateningly
you
wretch
kanai
shout
was
simultaneous
with
my
own
dare
you
bring
your
blasphemies
into
this
sacred
ashram
but
master
stood
protectingly
in
front
of
his
abuser
do
get
excited
over
nothing
this
man
is
only
doing
his
rightful
duty
the
officer
dazed
at
his
varying
reception
respectfully
offered
a
word
of
apology
and
sped
away
amazing
it
was
to
find
that
a
master
with
such
a
fiery
will
could
be
so
calm
within
he
fitted
the
vedic
definition
of
a
man
of
god
softer
than
the
flower
where
kindness
is
concerned
stronger
than
the
thunder
where
principles
are
at
stake
there
are
always
those
in
this
world
who
in
browning
words
endure
no
light
being
themselves
obscure
an
outsider
occasionally
berated
sri
yukteswar
for
an
imaginary
grievance
my
imperturbable
guru
listened
politely
analyzing
himself
to
see
if
any
shred
of
truth
lay
within
the
denunciation
these
scenes
would
bring
to
my
mind
one
of
master
inimitable
observations
some
people
try
to
be
tall
by
cutting
off
the
heads
of
others
the
unfailing
composure
of
a
saint
is
impressive
beyond
any
sermon
he
that
is
slow
to
anger
is
better
than
the
mighty
and
he
that
ruleth
his
spirit
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
i
often
reflected
that
my
majestic
master
could
easily
have
been
an
emperor
or
warrior
had
his
mind
been
centered
on
fame
or
worldly
achievement
he
had
chosen
instead
to
storm
those
inner
citadels
of
wrath
and
egotism
whose
fall
is
the
height

that

rabbi
israel
levinthal
pointed
out
in
it
is
true
that
the
subconscious
reveals
much
of
the
mystery
that
can
explain
human
actions
but
not
all
of
our
actions
it
can
explain
the
abnormal
but
not
deeds
that
are
above
the
normal
the
latest
psychology
sponsored
by
the
french
schools
has
discovered
a
new
region
in
man
which
it
terms
the
superconscious
in
contrast
to
the
subconscious
which
represents
the
submerged
currents
of
our
nature
it
reveals
the
heights
to
which
our
nature
can
reach
man
represents
a
triple
not
a
double
personality
our
conscious
and
subconscious
being
is
crowned
by
a
superconsciousness
many
years
ago
the
english
psychologist
myers
suggested
that
in
the
deep
of
our
being
is
a
rubbish
heap
as
well
as
a
treasure
house
in
contrast
to
the
psychology
that
centers
all
its
researches
on
the
subconscious
in
man
nature
this
new
psychology
of
the
superconscious
focuses
its
attention
upon
the
the
region
that
alone
can
explain
the
great
unselfish
heroic
deeds
of
men
jnana

of

main
paths

man
in
his
waking
state
puts
forth
innumerable
efforts
for
experiencing
sensual
pleasures
when
the
entire
group
of
sensory
organs
is
fatigued
he
forgets
even
the
pleasure
on
hand
and
goes
to

in

to
enjoy

easy

the

or
vedanta
literally
end
of
the

occur
in
certain
parts
of
the
vedas
as
essential
summaries
the
upanishads
furnish
the
doctrinal
basis
of
the
hindu
religion
they
received
the
following
tribute
from
schopenhauer
how
entirely
does
the
upanishad
breathe
throughout
the
holy
spirit
of
the
vedas
how
is
everyone
who
has
become
familiar
with
that
incomparable
book
stirred
by
that
spirit
to
the
very
depths
of
his

sentence
deep
original
and
sublime

arise
and
the
whole
is
pervaded
by
a
high
and

and

spirit
the
access
to
the

by

of

please
permit
me
to
go
to
the

i
hope
in
unbroken
solitude
to
achieve
continuous
divine
communion
i
actually
once
addressed
these
ungrateful
words
to
my
master
seized
by
one
of
the
unpredictable
delusions
which
occasionally
assail
the
devotee
i
felt
a
growing
impatience
with
hermitage
duties
and
college
studies
a
feebly
extenuating
circumstance
is
that
my
proposal
was
made
when
i
had
been
only
six
months
with
sri
yukteswar
not
yet
had
i
fully
surveyed
his
towering
stature
many
hillmen
live
in
the
himalayas
yet
possess
no
my
guru
answer
came
slowly
and
simply
wisdom
is
better
sought
from
a
man
of
realization
than
from
an
inert
mountain
ignoring
master
plain
hint
that
he
and
not
a
hill
was
my
teacher
i
repeated
my
plea
sri
yukteswar
vouchsafed
no
reply
i
took
his
silence
for
consent
a
precarious
interpretation
readily
accepted
at
one
convenience
in
my
calcutta
home
that
evening
i
busied
myself
with
travel
preparations
tying
a
few
articles
inside
a
blanket
i
remembered
a
similar
bundle
surreptitiously
dropped
from
my
attic
window
a
few
years
earlier
i
wondered
if
this
were
to
be
another
flight
toward
the
himalayas
the
first
time
my
spiritual
elation
had
been
high
tonight
conscience
smote
heavily
at
thought
of
leaving
my
guru
the
following
morning
i
sought
out
behari
pundit
my
sanskrit
professor
at
scottish
church
college
sir
you
have
told
me
of
your
friendship
with
a
great
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
please
give
me
his
address
you
mean
ram
gopal
muzumdar
i
call
him
the
saint
he
is
always
awake
in
an
ecstatic
consciousness
his
home
is
at
ranbajpur
near
tarakeswar
i
thanked
the
pundit
and
entrained
immediately
for
tarakeswar
i
hoped
to
silence
my
misgivings
by
wringing
a
sanction
from
the
sleepless
saint
to
engage
myself
in
lonely
himalayan
meditation
behari
friend
i
heard
had
received
illumination
after
many
years
of
kriya
yoga
practice
in
isolated
caves
at
tarakeswar
i
approached
a
famous
shrine
hindus
regard
it
with
the
same
veneration
that
catholics
give
to
the
lourdes
sanctuary
in
france
innumerable
healing
miracles
have
occurred
at
tarakeswar
including
one
for
a
member
of
my
family
i
sat
in
the
temple
there
for
a
week
my
eldest
aunt
once
told
me
observing
a
complete
fast
i
prayed
for
the
recovery
of
your
uncle
sarada
from
a
chronic
malady
on
the
seventh
day
i
found
a
herb
materialized
in
my
hand
i
made
a
brew
from
the
leaves
and
gave
it
to
your
uncle
his
disease
vanished
at
once
and
has
never
reappeared
i
entered
the
sacred
tarakeswar
shrine
the
altar
contains
nothing
but
a
round
stone
its
circumference
beginningless
and
endless
makes
it
aptly
significant
of
the
infinite
cosmic
abstractions
are
not
alien
even
to
the
humblest
indian
peasant
he
has
been
accused
by
westerners
in
fact
of
living
on
abstractions
my
own
mood
at
the
moment
was
so
austere
that
i
felt
disinclined
to
bow
before
the
stone
symbol
god
should
be
sought
i
reflected
only
within
the
soul
i
left
the
temple
without
genuflection
and
walked
briskly
toward
the
outlying
village
of
ranbajpur
my
appeal
to
a
for
guidance
caused
him
to
sink
into
long
cogitation
when
you
come
to
a
crossroad
turn
right
and
keep
going
he
finally
pronounced
oracularly
obeying
the
directions
i
wended
my
way
alongside
the
banks
of
a
canal
darkness
fell
the
outskirts
of
the
jungle
village
were
alive
with
winking
fireflies
and
the
howls
of
jackals
the
moonlight
was
too
faint
to
supply
any
reassurance
i
stumbled
on
for
two
hours
welcome
clang
of
a
cowbell
my
repeated
shouts
eventually
brought
a
peasant
to
my
side
i
am
looking
for
ram
gopal
babu
no
such
person
lives
in
our
village
the
man
tone
was
surly
you
are
probably
a
lying
detective
hoping
to
allay
suspicion
in
his
politically
troubled
mind
i
touchingly
explained
my
predicament
he
took
me
to
his
home
and
offered
a
hospitable
welcome
ranbajpur
is
far
from
here
he
remarked
at
the
crossroad
you
should
have
turned
left
not
right
my
earlier
informant
i
thought
sadly
was
a
distinct
menace
to
travelers
after
a
relishable
meal
of
coarse
rice
and
curry
of
potatoes
with
raw
bananas
i
retired
to
a
small
hut
adjoining
the
courtyard
in
the
distance
villagers
were
singing
to
the
loud
accompaniment
of
mridangas
and
cymbals
sleep
was
inconsiderable
that
night
i
prayed
deeply
to
be
directed
to
the
secret
yogi
ram
gopal
as
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
penetrated
the
fissures
of
my
dark
room
i
set
out
for
ranbajpur
crossing
rough
paddy
fields
i
trudged
over
sickled
stumps
of
the
prickly
plant
and
mounds
of
dried
clay
an
peasant
would
inform
me
invariably
that
my
destination
was
only
a
krosha
two
miles
in
six
hours
the
sun
traveled
victoriously
from
horizon
to
meridian
but
i
began
to
feel
that
i
would
ever
be
distant
from
ranbajpur
by
one
krosha
at
midafternoon
my
world
was
still
an
endless
paddy
field
heat
pouring
from
the
avoidless
sky
was
bringing
me
to
as
a
man
approached
at
leisurely
pace
i
hardly
dared
utter
my
usual
question
lest
it
summon
the
monotonous
just
a
krosha
the
stranger
halted
beside
me
short
and
slight
he
was
physically
unimpressive
save
for
an
extraordinary
pair
of
piercing
dark
eyes
i
was
planning
to
leave
ranbajpur
but
your
purpose
was
good
so
i
awaited
you
he
shook
his
finger
in
my
astounded
face
you
clever
to
think
that
unannounced
you
could
pounce
on
me
that
professor
behari
had
no
right
to
give
you
my
address
considering
that
introduction
of
myself
would
be
mere
verbosity
in
the
presence
of
this
master
i
stood
speechless
somewhat
hurt
at
my
reception
his
next
remark
was
abruptly
put
tell
me
where
do
you
think
god
is
why
he
is
within
me
and
everywhere
i
doubtless
looked
as
bewildered
as
i
felt
eh
the
saint
chuckled
then
why
young
sir
did
you
fail
to
bow
before
the
infinite
in
the
stone
symbol
at
the
tarakeswar
temple
yesterday
your
pride
caused
you
the
punishment
of
being
misdirected
by
the
who
was
not
bothered
by
fine
distinctions
of
left
and
right
today
too
you
have
had
a
fairly
uncomfortable
time
of
it
i
agreed
wholeheartedly
that
an
omniscient
eye
hid
within
the
unremarkable
body
before
me
healing
strength
emanated
from
the
yogi
i
was
instantly
refreshed
in
the
scorching
field
the
devotee
inclines
to
think
his
path
to
god
is
the
only
way
he
said
yoga
through
which
divinity
is
found
within
is
doubtless
the
highest
road
so
lahiri
mahasaya
has
told
us
but
discovering
the
lord
within
we
soon
perceive
him
without
holy
shrines
at
tarakeswar
and
elsewhere
are
rightly
venerated
as
nuclear
centers
of
spiritual
power
the
saint
censorious
attitude
vanished
his
eyes
became
compassionately
soft
he
patted
my
shoulder
young
yogi
i
see
you
are
running
away
from
your
master
he
has
everything
you
need
you
must
return
to
him
mountains
can
not
be
your
guru
ram
gopal
was
repeating
the
same
thought
which
sri
yukteswar
had
expressed
at
our
last
meeting
masters
are
under
no
cosmic
compulsion
to
limit
their
residence
my
companion
glanced
at
me
quizzically
the
himalayas
in
india
and
tibet
have
no
monopoly
on
saints
what
one
does
not
trouble
to
find
within
will
not
be
discovered
by
transporting
the
body
hither
and
yon
as
soon
as
the
devotee
is
willing
to
go
even
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
spiritual
enlightenment
his
guru
appears
i
silently
agreed
recalling
my
prayer
in
the
benares
hermitage
followed
by
the
meeting
with
sri
yukteswar
in
a
crowded
lane
are
you
able
to
have
a
little
room
where
you
can
close
the
door
and
be
alone
yes
i
reflected
that
this
saint
descended
from
the
general
to
the
particular
with
disconcerting
speed
that
is
your
cave
the
yogi
bestowed
on
me
a
gaze
of
illumination
which
i
have
never
forgotten
that
is
your
sacred
mountain
that
is
where
you
will
find
the
kingdom
of
god
his
simple
words
instantaneously
banished
my
lifelong
obsession
for
the
himalayas
in
a
burning
paddy
field
i
awoke
from
the
monticolous
dreams
of
eternal
snows
young
sir
your
divine
thirst
is
laudable
i
feel
great
love
for
you
ram
gopal
took
my
hand
and
led
me
to
a
quaint
hamlet
the
adobe
houses
were
covered
with
coconut
leaves
and
adorned
with
rustic
entrances
the
saint
seated
me
on
the
umbrageous
bamboo
platform
of
his
small
cottage
after
giving
me
sweetened
lime
juice
and
a
piece
of
rock
candy
he
entered
his
patio
and
assumed
the
lotus
posture
in
about
four
hours
i
opened
my
meditative
eyes
and
saw
that
the
moonlit
figure
of
the
yogi
was
still
motionless
as
i
was
sternly
reminding
my
stomach
that
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
ram
gopal
approached
me
i
see
you
are
famished
food
will
be
ready
soon
a
fire
was
kindled
under
a
clay
oven
on
the
patio
rice
and
dhal
were
quickly
served
on
large
banana
leaves
my
host
courteously
refused
my
aid
in
all
cooking
chores
the
guest
is
god
a
hindu
proverb
has
commanded
devout
observance
from
time
immemorial
in
my
later
world
travels
i
was
charmed
to
see
that
a
similar
respect
for
visitors
is
manifested
in
rural
sections
of
many
countries
the
city
dweller
finds
the
keen
edge
of
hospitality
blunted
by
superabundance
of
strange
faces
the
marts
of
men
seemed
remotely
dim
as
i
squatted
by
the
yogi
in
the
isolation
of
the
tiny
jungle
village
the
cottage
room
was
mysterious
with
a
mellow
light
ram
gopal
arranged
some
torn
blankets
on
the
floor
for
my
bed
and
seated
himself
on
a
straw
mat
overwhelmed
by
his
spiritual
magnetism
i
ventured
a
request
sir
why
do
you
grant
me
a
samadhi
dear
one
i
would
be
glad
to
convey
the
divine
contact
but
it
is
not
my
place
to
do
so
the
saint
looked
at
me
with
eyes
your
master
will
bestow
that
experience
shortly
your
body
is
not
tuned
just
yet
as
a
small
lamp
can
not
withstand
excessive
electrical
voltage
so
your
nerves
are
unready
for
the
cosmic
current
if
i
gave
you
the
infinite
ecstasy
right
now
you
would
burn
as
if
every
cell
were
on
fire
you
are
asking
illumination
from
me
the
yogi
continued
musingly
while
i
am
as
i
am
and
with
the
little
meditation
i
have
i
have
succeeded
in
pleasing
god
and
what
worth
i
may
find
in
his
eyes
at
the
final
reckoning
sir
have
you
not
been
singleheartedly
seeking
god
for
a
long
time
i
have
not
done
much
behari
must
have
told
you
something
of
my
life
for
twenty
years
i
occupied
a
secret
grotto
meditating
eighteen
hours
a
day
then
i
moved
to
a
more
inaccessible
cave
and
remained
there
for
years
entering
the
yoga
union
for
twenty
hours
daily
i
did
not
need
sleep
for
i
was
ever
with
god
my
body
was
more
rested
in
the
complete
calmness
of
the
superconsciousness
than
it
could
be
by
the
partial
peace
of
the
ordinary
subconscious
state
the
muscles
relax
during
sleep
but
the
heart
lungs
and
circulatory
system
are
constantly
at
work
they
get
no
rest
in
superconsciousness
the
internal
organs
remain
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
electrified
by
the
cosmic
energy
by
such
means
i
have
found
it
unnecessary
to
sleep
for
years
the
time
will
come
when
you
too
will
dispense
with
sleep
my
goodness
you
have
meditated
for
so
long
and
yet
are
unsure
of
the
lord
favor
i
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
then
what
about
us
poor
mortals
well
do
you
see
my
dear
boy
that
god
is
eternity
itself
to
assume
that
one
can
fully
know
him
by
years
of
meditation
is
rather
a
preposterous
expectation
babaji
assures
us
however
that
even
a
little
meditation
saves
one
from
the
dire
fear
of
death
and
states
do
not
fix
your
spiritual
ideal
on
a
small
mountain
but
hitch
it
to
the
star
of
unqualified
divine
attainment
if
you
work
hard
you
will
get
there
enthralled
by
the
prospect
i
asked
him
for
further
enlightening
words
he
related
a
wondrous
story
of
his
first
meeting
with
lahiri
mahasaya
guru
babaji
around
midnight
ram
gopal
fell
into
silence
and
i
lay
down
on
my
blankets
closing
my
eyes
i
saw
flashes
of
lightning
the
vast
space
within
me
was
a
chamber
of
molten
light
i
opened
my
eyes
and
observed
the
same
dazzling
radiance
the
room
became
a
part
of
that
infinite
vault
which
i
beheld
with
interior
vision
why
do
you
go
to
sleep
sir
how
can
i
sleep
in
the
presence
of
lightning
blazing
whether
my
eyes
are
shut
or
open
you
are
blessed
to
have
this
experience
the
spiritual
radiations
are
not
easily
seen
the
saint
added
a
few
words
of
affection
at
dawn
ram
gopal
gave
me
rock
candies
and
said
i
must
depart
i
felt
such
reluctance
to
bid
him
farewell
that
tears
coursed
down
my
cheeks
i
will
not
let
you
go
the
yogi
spoke
tenderly
i
will
do
something
for
you
he
smiled
and
looked
at
me
steadfastly
i
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
peace
rushing
like
a
mighty
flood
through
the
gates
of
my
eyes
i
was
instantaneously
healed
of
a
pain
in
my
back
which
had
troubled
me
intermittently
for
years
renewed
bathed
in
a
sea
of
luminous
joy
i
wept
no
more
after
touching
the
saint
feet
i
sauntered
into
the
jungle
making
my
way
through
its
tropical
tangle
until
i
reached
tarakeswar
there
i
made
a
second
pilgrimage
to
the
famous
shrine
and
prostrated
myself
fully
before
the
altar
the
round
stone
enlarged
before
my
inner
vision
until
it
became
the
cosmical
spheres
ring
within
ring
zone
after
zone
all
dowered
with
divinity
i
entrained
happily
an
hour
later
for
calcutta
my
travels
ended
not
in
the
lofty
mountains
but
in
the
himalayan
presence
of
my
master
drums
used
only
for
devotional
music
one
is
reminded
here
of
dostoevski
observation
a
man
who
bows
down
to
nothing
can
never
bear
the
burden
of
himself
see
chapter
chapter
an
experience
in
cosmic
consciousness
i
am
here
guruji
my
shamefacedness
spoke
more
eloquently
for
me
let
us
go
to
the
kitchen
and
find
something
to
eat
sri
manner
was
as
natural
as
if
hours
and
not
days
had
separated
us
master
i
must
have
disappointed
you
by
my
abrupt
departure
from
my
duties
here
i
thought
you
might
be
angry
with
me
no
of
course
not
wrath
springs
only
from
thwarted
desires
i
do
not
expect
anything
from
others
so
their
actions
can
not
be
in
opposition
to
wishes
of
mine
i
would
not
use
you
for
my
own
ends
i
am
happy
only
in
your
own
true
happiness
sir
one
hears
of
divine
love
in
a
vague
way
but
for
the
first
time
i
am
having
a
concrete
example
in
your
angelic
self
in
the
world
even
a
father
does
not
easily
forgive
his
son
if
he
leaves
his
parent
business
without
warning
but
you
show
not
the
slightest
vexation
though
you
must
have
been
put
to
great
inconvenience
by
the
many
unfinished
tasks
i
left
behind
we
looked
into
each
other
eyes
where
tears
were
shining
a
blissful
wave
engulfed
me
i
was
conscious
that
the
lord
in
the
form
of
my
guru
was
expanding
the
small
ardors
of
my
heart
into
the
incompressible
reaches
of
cosmic
love
a
few
mornings
later
i
made
my
way
to
master
empty
sitting
room
i
planned
to
meditate
but
my
laudable
purpose
was
unshared
by
disobedient
thoughts
they
scattered
like
birds
before
the
hunter
mukunda
sri
yukteswar
voice
sounded
from
a
distant
inner
balcony
i
felt
as
rebellious
as
my
thoughts
master
always
urges
me
to
meditate
i
muttered
to
myself
he
should
not
disturb
me
when
he
knows
why
i
came
to
his
room
he
summoned
me
again
i
remained
obstinately
silent
the
third
time
his
tone
held
rebuke
sir
i
am
meditating
i
shouted
protestingly
i
know
how
you
are
meditating
my
guru
called
out
with
your
mind
distributed
like
leaves
in
a
storm
come
here
to
me
snubbed
and
exposed
i
made
my
way
sadly
to
his
side
poor
boy
the
mountains
could
give
what
you
wanted
master
spoke
caressively
comfortingly
his
calm
gaze
was
unfathomable
your
heart
desire
shall
be
fulfilled
sri
yukteswar
seldom
indulged
in
riddles
i
was
bewildered
he
struck
gently
on
my
chest
above
the
heart
my
body
became
immovably
rooted
breath
was
drawn
out
of
my
lungs
as
if
by
some
huge
magnet
soul
and
mind
instantly
lost
their
physical
bondage
and
streamed
out
like
a
fluid
piercing
light
from
my
every
pore
the
flesh
was
as
though
dead
yet
in
my
intense
awareness
i
knew
that
never
before
had
i
been
fully
alive
my
sense
of
identity
was
no
longer
narrowly
confined
to
a
body
but
embraced
the
circumambient
atoms
people
on
distant
streets
seemed
to
be
moving
gently
over
my
own
remote
periphery
the
roots
of
plants
and
trees
appeared
through
a
dim
transparency
of
the
soil
i
discerned
the
inward
flow
of
their
sap
the
whole
vicinity
lay
bare
before
me
my
ordinary
frontal
vision
was
now
changed
to
a
vast
spherical
sight
simultaneously
through
the
back
of
my
head
i
saw
men
strolling
far
down
rai
ghat
road
and
noticed
also
a
white
cow
who
was
leisurely
approaching
when
she
reached
the
space
in
front
of
the
open
ashram
gate
i
observed
her
with
my
two
physical
eyes
as
she
passed
by
behind
the
brick
wall
i
saw
her
clearly
still
all
objects
within
my
panoramic
gaze
trembled
and
vibrated
like
quick
motion
pictures
my
body
master
the
pillared
courtyard
the
furniture
and
floor
the
trees
and
sunshine
occasionally
became
violently
agitated
until
all
melted
into
a
luminescent
sea
even
as
sugar
crystals
thrown
into
a
glass
of
water
dissolve
after
being
shaken
the
unifying
light
alternated
with
materializations
of
form
the
metamorphoses
revealing
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
in
creation
an
oceanic
joy
broke
upon
calm
endless
shores
of
my
soul
the
spirit
of
god
i
realized
is
exhaustless
bliss
his
body
is
countless
tissues
of
light
a
swelling
glory
within
me
began
to
envelop
towns
continents
the
earth
solar
and
stellar
systems
tenuous
nebulae
and
floating
universes
the
entire
cosmos
gently
luminous
like
a
city
seen
afar
at
night
glimmered
within
the
infinitude
of
my
being
the
sharply
etched
global
outlines
faded
somewhat
at
the
farthest
edges
there
i
could
see
a
mellow
radiance
it
was
indescribably
subtle
the
planetary
pictures
were
formed
of
a
grosser
light
the
divine
dispersion
of
rays
poured
from
an
eternal
source
blazing
into
galaxies
transfigured
with
ineffable
auras
again
and
again
i
saw
the
creative
beams
condense
into
constellations
then
resolve
into
sheets
of
transparent
flame
by
rhythmic
reversion
sextillion
worlds
passed
into
diaphanous
luster
fire
became
firmament
i
cognized
the
center
of
the
empyrean
as
a
point
of
intuitive
perception
in
my
heart
irradiating
splendor
issued
from
my
nucleus
to
every
part
of
the
universal
structure
blissful
amrita
the
nectar
of
immortality
pulsed
through
me
with
a
quicksilverlike
fluidity
the
creative
voice
of
god
i
heard
resounding
as
aum
the
vibration
of
the
cosmic
motor
suddenly
the
breath
returned
to
my
lungs
with
a
disappointment
almost
unbearable
i
realized
that
my
infinite
immensity
was
lost
once
more
i
was
limited
to
the
humiliating
cage
of
a
body
not
easily
accommodative
to
the
spirit
like
a
prodigal
child
i
had
run
away
from
my
macrocosmic
home
and
imprisoned
myself
in
a
narrow
microcosm
my
guru
was
standing
motionless
before
me
i
started
to
drop
at
his
holy
feet
in
gratitude
for
the
experience
in
cosmic
consciousness
which
i
had
long
passionately
sought
he
held
me
upright
and
spoke
calmly
unpretentiously
you
must
not
get
overdrunk
with
ecstasy
much
work
yet
remains
for
you
in
the
world
come
let
us
sweep
the
balcony
floor
then
we
shall
walk
by
the
ganges
i
fetched
a
broom
master
i
knew
was
teaching
me
the
secret
of
balanced
living
the
soul
must
stretch
over
the
cosmogonic
abysses
while
the
body
performs
its
daily
duties
when
we
set
out
later
for
a
stroll
i
was
still
entranced
in
unspeakable
rapture
i
saw
our
bodies
as
two
astral
pictures
moving
over
a
road
by
the
river
whose
essence
was
sheer
light
it
is
the
spirit
of
god
that
actively
sustains
every
form
and
force
in
the
universe
yet
he
is
transcendental
and
aloof
in
the
blissful
uncreated
void
beyond
the
worlds
of
vibratory
phenomena
master
explained
saints
who
realize
their
divinity
even
while
in
the
flesh
know
a
similar
twofold
existence
conscientiously
engaging
in
earthly
work
they
yet
remain
immersed
in
an
inward
beatitude
the
lord
has
created
all
men
from
the
limitless
joy
of
his
being
though
they
are
painfully
cramped
by
the
body
god
nevertheless
expects
that
souls
made
in
his
image
shall
ultimately
rise
above
all
sense
identifications
and
reunite
with
him
the
cosmic
vision
left
many
permanent
lessons
by
daily
stilling
my
thoughts
i
could
win
release
from
the
delusive
conviction
that
my
body
was
a
mass
of
flesh
and
bones
traversing
the
hard
soil
of
matter
the
breath
and
the
restless
mind
i
saw
were
like
storms
which
lashed
the
ocean
of
light
into
waves
of
material
sky
human
beings
animals
birds
trees
no
perception
of
the
infinite
as
one
light
could
be
had
except
by
calming
those
storms
as
often
as
i
silenced
the
two
natural
tumults
i
beheld
the
multitudinous
waves
of
creation
melt
into
one
lucent
sea
even
as
the
waves
of
the
ocean
their
tempests
subsiding
serenely
dissolve
into
unity
a
master
bestows
the
divine
experience
of
cosmic
consciousness
when
his
disciple
by
meditation
has
strengthened
his
mind
to
a
degree
where
the
vast
vistas
would
not
overwhelm
him
the
experience
can
never
be
given
through
one
mere
intellectual
willingness
or
only
adequate
enlargement
by
yoga
practice
and
devotional
bhakti
can
prepare
the
mind
to
absorb
the
liberating
shock
of
omnipresence
it
comes
with
a
natural
inevitability
to
the
sincere
devotee
his
intense
craving
begins
to
pull
at
god
with
an
irresistible
force
the
lord
as
the
cosmic
vision
is
drawn
by
the
seeker
magnetic
ardor
into
his
range
of
consciousness
i
wrote
in
my
later
years
the
following
poem
samadhi
endeavoring
to
convey
the
glory
of
its
cosmic
state
vanished
the
veils
of
light
and
shade
lifted
every
vapor
of
sorrow
sailed
away
all
dawns
of
fleeting
joy
gone
the
dim
sensory
mirage
love
hate
health
disease
life
death
perished
these
false
shadows
on
the
screen
of
duality
waves
of
laughter
scyllas
of
sarcasm
melancholic
whirlpools
melting
in
the
vast
sea
of
bliss
the
storm
of
maya
stilled
by
magic
wand
of
intuition
deep
the
universe
forgotten
dream
subconsciously
lurks
ready
to
invade
my
memory
divine
i
live
without
the
cosmic
shadow
but
it
is
not
bereft
of
me
as
the
sea
exists
without
the
waves
but
they
breathe
not
without
the
sea
dreams
wakings
states
of
deep
turia
sleep

no
more
for
me
but
i
i
everywhere
planets

bursts
of

of

swallowed
transmuted
all
into
a

of

of
my
own

smoldering
joy
by
meditation
blinding
my
tearful
eyes
burst
into
immortal
flames
of
bliss
consumed
my
tears
my

my
all
thou

i
am
thou
knowing

known
as
one
tranquilled
unbroken
thrill
eternally
living
peace
enjoyable
beyond
imagination
of
expectancy
samadhi
bliss
not
an
unconscious
state
or
mental
chloroform
without
wilful
return
samadhi
but
extends
my
conscious
realm
beyond
limits
of
the
mortal
frame
to
farthest
boundary
of
eternity
where
i
the
cosmic
sea
watch
the
little
ego
floating
in
me
the
sparrow
each
grain
of
sand
fall
not
without
my
sight
all
space
floats
like
an
iceberg
in
my
mental
sea
colossal
container
i
of
all
things
made
by
deeper
longer
thirsty
meditation
comes
this
celestial
samadhi
mobile
murmurs
of
atoms
are
heard
the
dark
earth
mountains
vales
lo
molten
liquid
flowing
seas
change
into
vapors
of
nebulae
aum
blows
upon
vapors
opening
wondrously
their
veils
oceans
stand
revealed
shining
electrons
till
at
last
sound
of
the
cosmic
drum
vanish
the
grosser
lights
into
eternal
rays
of
bliss
from
joy
i
came
for
joy
i
live
in
sacred
joy
i
melt
ocean
of
mind
i
drink
all
creation
waves
four
veils
of
solid
liquid
vapor
light
lift
aright
myself
in
everything
enters
the
great
myself
gone
forever
fitful
flickering
shadows
of
mortal
memory
spotless
is
my
mental
sky
below
ahead
and
high
above
eternity
and
i
one
united
ray
a
tiny
bubble
of
laughter
i
am
become
the
sea
of
mirth
itself
sri
yukteswar
taught
me
how
to
summon
the
blessed
experience
at
will
and
also
how
to
transmit
it
to
others
if
their
intuitive
channels
were
developed
for
months
i
entered
the
ecstatic
union
comprehending
why
the
upanishads
say
god
is
rasa
the
most
relishable
one
day
however
i
took
a
problem
to
master
i
want
to
know
shall
i
find
god
you
have
found
him
o
no
sir
i
do
think
so
my
guru
was
smiling
i
am
sure
you
are
expecting
a
venerable
personage
adorning
a
throne
in
some
antiseptic
corner
of
the
cosmos
i
see
however
that
you
are
imagining
that
the
possession
of
miraculous
powers
is
knowledge
of
god
one
might
have
the
whole
universe
and
find
the
lord
elusive
still
spiritual
advancement
is
not
measured
by
one
outward
powers
but
only
by
the
depth
of
his
bliss
in
meditation
joy
is
god
he
is
inexhaustible
as
you
continue
your
meditations
during
the
years
he
will
beguile
you
with
an
infinite
ingenuity
devotees
like
yourself
who
have
found
the
way
to
god
never
dream
of
exchanging
him
for
any
other
happiness
he
is
seductive
beyond
thought
of
competition
how
quickly
we
weary
of
earthly
pleasures
desire
for
material
things
is
endless
man
is
never
satisfied
completely
and
pursues
one
goal
after
another
the
else
he
seeks
is
the
lord
who
alone
can
grant
lasting
joy
outward
longings
drive
us
from
the
eden
within
they
offer
false
pleasures
which
only
impersonate
the
lost
paradise
is
quickly
regained
through
divine
meditation
as
god
is
unanticipatory
we
never
tire
of
him
can
we
be
surfeited
with
bliss
delightfully
varied
throughout
eternity
i
understand
now
sir
why
saints
call
the
lord
unfathomable
even
everlasting
life
could
not
suffice
to
appraise
him
that
is
true
but
he
is
also
near
and
dear
after
the
mind
has
been
cleared
by
kriya
yoga
of
sensory
obstacles
meditation
furnishes
a
twofold
proof
of
god
joy
is
evidence
of
his
existence
convincing
to
our
very
atoms
also
in
meditation
one
finds
his
instant
guidance
his
adequate
response
to
every
difficulty
i
see
guruji
you
have
solved
my
problem
i
smiled
gratefully
i
do
realize
now
that
i
have
found
god
for
whenever
the
joy
of
meditation
has
returned
subconsciously
during
my
active
hours
i
have
been
subtly
directed
to
adopt
the
right
course
in
everything
even
details
human
life
is
beset
with
sorrow
until
we
know
how
to
tune
in
with
the
divine
will
whose
course
is
often
baffling
to
the
egoistic
intelligence
god
bears
the
burden
of
the
cosmos
he
alone
can
give
unerring
counsel
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
for
the
father
judgeth
no
man
but
hath
committed
all
judgment
unto
the
son
no
man
hath
seen
god
at
any
time
the
only
begotten
son
which
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
he
hath
declared
him
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
that
believeth
on
me
the
works
that
i
do
shall
he
do
also
and
greater
works
than
these
shall
he
do
because
i
go
unto
my
father
but
the
comforter
which
is
the
holy
ghost
whom
the
father
will
send
in
my
name
he
shall
teach
you
all
things
and
bring
all
things
to
your
remembrance
whatsoever
i
have
said
to
you
these
biblical
words
refer
to
the
threefold
nature
of
god
as
father
son
holy
ghost
sat
tat
aum
in
the
hindu
scriptures
god
the
father
is
the
absolute
unmanifested
existing

god
the
son
is
the

this

heard
in

and
reveals
to

ultimate
truth
chapter
the
cauliflower
robbery
master
a
gift
for
you
these
six
huge
cauliflowers
were
planted
with
my
hands
i
have
watched
over
their
growth
with
the
tender
care
of
a
mother
nursing
her
child
i
presented
the
basket
of
vegetables
with
a
ceremonial
flourish
thank
you
sri
yukteswar
smile
was
warm
with
appreciation
please
keep
them
in
your
room
i
shall
need
them
tomorrow
for
a
special
dinner
i
had
just
arrived
in
puri
to
spend
my
college
summer
vacation
with
my
guru
at
his
seaside
hermitage
built
by
master
and
his
disciples
the
cheerful
little
retreat
fronts
on
the
bay
of
bengal
i
awoke
early
the
following
morning
refreshed
by
the
salty
sea
breezes
and
the
charm
of
my
surroundings
sri
yukteswar
melodious
voice
was
calling
i
took
a
look
at
my
cherished
cauliflowers
and
stowed
them
neatly
under
my
bed
come
let
us
go
to
the
beach
master
led
the
way
several
young
disciples
and
myself
followed
in
a
scattered
group
our
guru
surveyed
us
in
mild
criticism
when
our
western
brothers
walk
they
usually
take
pride
in
unison
now
please
march
in
two
rows
keep
rhythmic
step
with
one
another
sri
yukteswar
watched
as
we
obeyed
he
began
to
sing
boys
go
to
and
fro
in
a
pretty
little
row
i
could
not
but
admire
the
ease
with
which
master
was
able
to
match
the
brisk
pace
of
his
young
students
halt
my
guru
eyes
sought
mine
did
you
remember
to
lock
the
back
door
of
the
hermitage
illustration
my
guru
seaside
hermitage
at
puri
a
steady
stream
of
visitors
poured
from
the
world
into
the
hermitage
tranquillity
a
number
of
learned
men
came
with
the
expectation
of
meeting
an
orthodox
religionist
a
supercilious
smile
or
a
glance
of
amused
tolerance
occasionally
betrayed
that
the
newcomers
anticipated
nothing
more
than
a
few
pious
platitudes
yet
their
reluctant
departure
would
bring
an
expressed
conviction
that
sri
yukteswar
had
shown
precise
insight
into
their
specialized
fields
of
knowledge
my
guru
always
had
young
resident
disciples
in
his
hermitage
he
directed
their
minds
and
lives
with
that
careful
discipline
in
which
the
word
disciple
is
etymologically
see
i
think
so
sir
sri
yukteswar
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
a
smile
on
his
lips
no
you
forgot
he
said
finally
divine
contemplation
must
not
be
made
an
excuse
for
material
carelessness
you
have
neglected
your
duty
in
safeguarding
the
ashram
you
must
be
punished
i
thought
he
was
obscurely
joking
when
he
added
your
six
cauliflowers
will
soon
be
only
five
we
turned
around
at
master
orders
and
marched
back
until
we
were
close
to
the
hermitage
rest
awhile
mukunda
look
across
the
compound
on
our
left
observe
the
road
beyond
a
certain
man
will
arrive
there
presently
he
will
be
the
means
of
your
chastisement
i
concealed
my
vexation
at
these
incomprehensible
remarks
a
peasant
soon
appeared
on
the
road
he
was
dancing
grotesquely
and
flinging
his
arms
about
with
meaningless
gestures
almost
paralyzed
with
curiosity
i
glued
my
eyes
on
the
hilarious
spectacle
as
the
man
reached
a
point
in
the
road
where
he
would
vanish
from
our
view
sri
yukteswar
said
now
he
will
return
the
peasant
at
once
changed
his
direction
and
made
for
the
rear
of
the
ashram
crossing
a
sandy
tract
he
entered
the
building
by
the
back
door
i
had
left
it
unlocked
even
as
my
guru
had
said
the
man
emerged
shortly
holding
one
of
my
prized
cauliflowers
he
now
strode
along
respectably
invested
with
the
dignity
of
possession
the
unfolding
farce
in
which
my
role
appeared
to
be
that
of
bewildered
victim
was
not
so
disconcerting
that
i
failed
in
indignant
pursuit
i
was
halfway
to
the
road
when
master
recalled
me
he
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
with
laughter
that
poor
crazy
man
has
been
longing
for
a
cauliflower
he
explained
between
outbursts
of
mirth
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
he
got
one
of
yours
so
i
dashed
to
my
room
where
i
found
that
the
thief
evidently
one
with
a
vegetable
fixation
had
left
untouched
my
gold
rings
watch
and
money
all
lying
openly
on
the
blanket
he
had
crawled
instead
under
the
bed
where
completely
hidden
from
casual
sight
one
of
my
cauliflowers
had
aroused
his
singlehearted
desire
i
asked
sri
yukteswar
that
evening
to
explain
the
incident
which
had
i
thought
a
few
baffling
features
my
guru
shook
his
head
slowly
you
will
understand
it
someday
science
will
soon
discover
a
few
of
these
hidden
laws
when
the
wonders
of
radio
burst
some
years
later
on
an
astounded
world
i
remembered
master
prediction
concepts
of
time
and
space
were
annihilated
no
peasant
home
so
narrow
that
london
or
calcutta
could
not
enter
the
dullest
intelligence
enlarged
before
indisputable
proof
of
one
aspect
of
man
omnipresence
the
plot
of
the
cauliflower
comedy
can
be
best
understood
by
a
radio
analogy
sri
yukteswar
was
a
perfect
human
radio
thoughts
are
no
more
than
very
gentle
vibrations
moving
in
the
ether
just
as
a
sensitized
radio
picks
up
a
desired
musical
number
out
of
thousands
of
other
programs
from
every
direction
so
my
guru
had
been
able
to
catch
the
thought
of
the
man
who
hankered
for
a
cauliflower
out
of
the
countless
thoughts
of
broadcasting
human
wills
in
the
world
by
his
powerful
will
master
was
also
a
human
broadcasting
station
and
had
successfully
directed
the
peasant
to
reverse
his
steps
and
go
to
a
certain
room
for
a
single
cauliflower
intuition
is
soul
guidance
appearing
naturally
in
man
during
those
instants
when
his
mind
is
calm
nearly
everyone
has
had
the
experience
of
an
inexplicably
correct
hunch
or
has
transferred
his
thoughts
effectively
to
another
person
the
human
mind
free
from
the
static
of
restlessness
can
perform
through
its
antenna
of
intuition
all
the
functions
of
complicated
radio
and
receiving
thoughts
and
tuning
out
undesirable
ones
as
the
power
of
a
radio
depends
on
the
amount
of
electrical
current
it
can
utilize
so
the
human
radio
is
energized
according
to
the
power
of
will
possessed
by
each
individual
all
thoughts
vibrate
eternally
in
the
cosmos
by
deep
concentration
a
master
is
able
to
detect
the
thoughts
of
any
mind
living
or
dead
thoughts
are
universally
and
not
individually
rooted
a
truth
can
not
be
created
but
only
perceived
the
erroneous
thoughts
of
man
result
from
imperfections
in
his
discernment
the
goal
of
yoga
science
is
to
calm
the
mind
that
without
distortion
it
may
mirror
the
divine
vision
in
the
universe
radio
and
television
have
brought
the
instantaneous
sound
and
sight
of
remote
persons
to
the
firesides
of
millions
the
first
faint
scientific
intimations
that
man
is
an
spirit
not
a
body
confined
to
a
point
in
space
but
the
vast
soul
which
the
ego
in
most
barbaric
modes
conspires
in
vain
to
cramp
very
strange
very
wonderful
seemingly
very
improbable
phenomena
may
yet
appear
which
when
once
established
will
not
astonish
us
more
than
we
are
now
astonished
at
all
that
science
has
taught
us
during
the
last
century
charles
robert
richet
nobel
prizeman
in
physiology
has
declared
it
is
assumed
that
the
phenomena
which
we
now
accept
without
surprise
do
not
excite
our
astonishment
because
they
are
understood
but
this
is
not
the
case
if
they
do
not
surprise
us
it
is
not
because
they
are
understood
it
is
because
they
are
familiar
for
if
that
which
is
not
understood
ought
to
surprise
us
we
should
be
surprised
at
fall
of
a
stone
thrown
into
the
air
the
acorn
which
becomes
an
oak
mercury
which
expands
when
it
is
heated
iron
attracted
by
a
magnet
phosphorus
which
burns
when
it
is
rubbed
the
science
of
today
is
a
light
matter
the
revolutions
and
evolutions
which
it
will
experience
in
a
hundred
thousand
years
will
far
exceed
the
most
daring
anticipations
the
surprising
amazing
unforeseen
our
descendants
will
discover
are
even
now
all
around
us
staring
us
in
the
eyes
so
to
speak
and
yet
we
do
not
see
them
but
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
we
do
not
see
them
we
do
not
wish
to
see
them
for
as
soon
as
an
unexpected
and
unfamiliar
fact
appears
we
try
to
fit
it
into
the
framework
of
the
commonplaces
of
acquired
knowledge
and
we
are
indignant
that
anyone
should
dare
to
experiment
further
a
humorous
occurrence
took
place
a
few
days
after
i
had
been
so
implausibly
robbed
of
a
cauliflower
a
certain
kerosene
lamp
could
not
be
found
having
so
lately
witnessed
my
guru
omniscient
insight
i
thought
he
would
demonstrate
that
it
was
child
play
to
locate
the
lamp
master
perceived
my
expectation
with
exaggerated
gravity
he
questioned
all
ashram
residents
a
young
disciple
confessed
that
he
had
used
the
lamp
to
go
to
the
well
in
the
back
yard
sri
yukteswar
gave
the
solemn
counsel
seek
the
lamp
near
the
well
i
rushed
there
no
lamp
crestfallen
i
returned
to
my
guru
he
was
now
laughing
heartily
without
compunction
for
my
disillusionment
too
bad
i
could
direct
you
to
the
vanished
lamp
i
am
not
a
fortune
teller
with
twinkling
eyes
he
added
i
am
not
even
a
satisfactory
sherlock
holmes
i
realized
that
master
would
never
display
his
powers
when
challenged
or
for
a
triviality
delightful
weeks
sped
by
sri
yukteswar
was
planning
a
religious
procession
he
asked
me
to
lead
the
disciples
over
the
town
and
beach
of
puri
the
festive
day
dawned
as
one
of
the
hottest
of
the
summer
guruji
how
can
i
take
the
barefooted
students
over
the
fiery
sands
i
spoke
despairingly
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
master
responded
the
lord
will
send
an
umbrella
of
clouds
you
all
shall
walk
in
comfort
i
happily
organized
the
procession
our
group
started
from
the
ashram
with
a
banner
designed
by
sri
yukteswar
it
bore
the
symbol
of
the
single
eye
the
telescopic
gaze
of
intuition
no
sooner
had
we
left
the
hermitage
than
the
part
of
the
sky
which
was
overhead
became
filled
with
clouds
as
though
by
magic
to
the
accompaniment
of
astonished
ejaculations
from
all
sides
a
very
light
shower
fell
cooling
the
city
streets
and
the
burning
seashore
the
soothing
drops
descended
during
the
two
hours
of
the
parade
the
exact
instant
at
which
our
group
returned
to
the
ashram
the
clouds
and
rain
passed
away
tracelessly
you
see
how
god
feels
for
us
master
replied
after
i
had
expressed
my
gratitude
the
lord
responds
to
all
and
works
for
all
just
as
he
sent
rain
at
my
plea
so
he
fulfills
any
sincere
desire
of
the
devotee
seldom
do
men
realize
how
often
god
heeds
their
prayers
he
is
not
partial
to
a
few
but
listens
to
everyone
who
approaches
him
trustingly
his
children
should
ever
have
implicit
faith
in
the
of
their
omnipresent
father
sri
yukteswar
sponsored
four
yearly
festivals
at
the
equinoxes
and
solstices
when
his
students
gathered
from
far
and
near
the
winter
solstice
celebration
was
held
in
serampore
the
first
one
i
attended
left
me
with
a
permanent
blessing
the
festivities
started
in
the
morning
with
a
barefoot
procession
along
the
streets
the
voices
of
a
hundred
students
rang
out
with
sweet
religious
songs
a
few
musicians
played
the
flute
and
khol
kartal
drums
and
cymbals
enthusiastic
townspeople
strewed
the
path
with
flowers
glad
to
be
summoned
from
prosaic
tasks
by
our
resounding
praise
of
the
lord
blessed
name
the
long
tour
ended
in
the
courtyard
of
the
hermitage
there
we
encircled
our
guru
while
students
on
upper
balconies
showered
us
with
marigold
blossoms
many
guests
went
upstairs
to
receive
a
pudding
of
channa
and
oranges
i
made
my
way
to
a
group
of
brother
disciples
who
were
serving
today
as
cooks
food
for
such
large
gatherings
had
to
be
cooked
outdoors
in
huge
cauldrons
the
improvised
brick
stoves
were
smoky
and
but
we
laughed
merrily
at
our
work
religious
festivals
in
india
are
never
considered
troublesome
each
one
does
his
part
supplying
money
rice
vegetables
or
his
personal
services
master
was
soon
in
our
midst
supervising
the
details
of
the
feast
busy
every
moment
he
kept
pace
with
the
most
energetic
young
student
a
sankirtan
group
chanting
accompanied
by
the
harmonium
and
indian
drums
was
in
progress
on
the
second
floor
sri
yukteswar
listened
appreciatively
his
musical
sense
was
acutely
perfect
they
are
off
key
master
left
the
cooks
and
joined
the
artists
the
melody
was
heard
again
this
time
correctly
rendered

as
well
as

considered

and

while
brahma
accentuated

malkounsa
raga
is
heard
at
midnights
in

for
valor
the
ancient
rishis
discovered
these
laws
of
sound
alliance
between
nature
and
man
because
nature
is
an
objectification
of
aum
the
primal
sound
or
vibratory
word
man
can
obtain
control
over
all
natural
manifestations
through
the
use
of
certain
mantras
or
chants
historical
documents
tell
of
the
remarkable
powers
possessed
by
miyan
tan
sen
sixteenth
century
court
musician
for
akbar
the
great
commanded
by
the
emperor
to
sing
a
night
raga
while
the
sun
was
overhead
tan
sen
intoned
a
mantra
which
instantly
caused
the
whole
palace
precincts
to
become
enveloped
in
darkness
indian
music
divides
the
octave
into
srutis
or
these
microtonal
intervals
permit
fine
shades
of
musical
expression
unattainable
by
the
western
chromatic
scale
of
semitones
each
one
of
the
seven
basic
notes
of
the
octave
is
associated
in
hindu
mythology
with
a
color
and
the
natural
cry
of
a
bird

with
green

and
the
elephant
three
harmonic
minor
melodic
the
only
ones
which
occidental
music
employs
but
indian
music
outlines
thatas
or
scales
the
musician
has
a
creative
scope
for
endless
improvisation
around
the
fixed
traditional
melody
or
raga
he
concentrates
on
the
sentiment
or
definitive
mood
of
the
structural
theme
and
then
embroiders
it
to
the
limits
of
his
own
originality
the
hindu
musician
does
not
read
set
notes
he
clothes
anew
at
each
playing
the
bare
skeleton
of
the
raga
often
confining
himself
to
a
single
melodic
sequence
stressing
by
repetition
all
its
subtle
microtonal
and
rhythmic
variations
bach
among
western
composers
had
an
understanding
of
the
charm
and
power
of
repetitious
sound
slightly
differentiated
in
a
hundred
complex
ways
ancient
sanskrit
literature
describes
talas
or
the
traditional
founder
of
hindu
music
bharata
is
said
to
have
isolated
kinds
of
tala
in
the
song
of
a
lark
the
origin
of
tala
or
rhythm
is
rooted
in
human
double
time
of
walking
and
the
triple
time
of
respiration
in
sleep
when
inhalation
is
twice
the
length
of
exhalation
india
has
always
recognized
the
human
voice
as
the
most
perfect
instrument
of
sound
hindu
music
therefore
largely
confines
itself
to
the
voice
range
of
three
octaves
for
the
same
reason
melody
relation
of
successive
notes
is
stressed
rather
than
harmony
relation
of
simultaneous
notes
the
deeper
aim
of
the
early
was
to
blend
the
singer
with
the
cosmic
song
which
can
be
heard
through
awakening
of
occult
spinal
centers
indian
music
is
a
subjective
spiritual
and
individualistic
art
aiming
not
at
symphonic
brilliance
but
at
personal
harmony
with
the
oversoul
the
sanskrit
word
for
musician
is
bhagavathar
he
who
sings
the
praises
of
god
the
sankirtans
or
musical
gatherings
are
an
effective
form
of
yoga
or
spiritual
discipline
necessitating
deep
concentration
intense
absorption
in
the
seed
thought
and
sound
because
man
himself
is
an
expression
of
the
creative
word
sound
has
the
most
potent
and
immediate
effect
on
him
offering
a
way
to
remembrance
of
his
divine
origin
the
sankirtan
issuing
from
sri
yukteswar
sitting
room
on
the
day
of
the
festival
was
inspiring
to
the
cooks
amidst
the
steaming
pots
my
brother
disciples
and
i
joyously
sang
the
refrains
beating
time
with
our
hands
by
sunset
we
had
served
our
hundreds
of
visitors
with
khichuri
rice
and
lentils
vegetable
curry
and
rice
pudding
we
laid
cotton
blankets
over
the
courtyard
soon
the
assemblage
was
squatting
under
the
starry
vault
quietly
attentive
to
the
wisdom
pouring
from
sri
yukteswar
lips
his
public
speeches
emphasized
the
value
of
kriya
yoga
and
a
life
of
calmness
determination
simple
diet
and
regular
exercise
a
group
of
very
young
disciples
then
chanted
a
few
sacred
hymns
the
meeting
concluded
with
sankirtan
from
ten
until
midnight
the
ashram
residents
washed
pots
and
pans
and
cleared
the
courtyard
my
guru
called
me
to
his
side
i
am
pleased
over
your
cheerful
labors
today
and
during
the
past
week
of
preparations
i
want
you
with
me
you
may
sleep
in
my
bed
tonight
this
was
a
privilege
i
had
never
thought
would
fall
to
my
lot
we
sat
awhile
in
a
state
of
intense
divine
tranquillity
hardly
ten
minutes
after
we
had
gotten
into
bed
master
rose
and
began
to
dress
what
is
the
matter
sir
i
felt
a
tinge
of
unreality
in
the
unexpected
joy
of
sleeping
beside
my
guru
i
think
that
a
few
students
who
missed
their
proper
train
connections
will
be
here
soon
let
us
have
some
food
ready
guruji
no
one
would
come
at
one
in
the
morning
stay
in
bed
you
have
been
working
very
hard
but
i
am
going
to
cook
at
sri
yukteswar
resolute
tone
i
jumped
up
and
followed
him
to
the
small
kitchen
adjacent
to
the
inner
balcony
rice
and
dhal
were
soon
boiling
my
guru
smiled
affectionately
tonight
you
have
conquered
fatigue
and
fear
of
hard
work
you
shall
never
be
bothered
by
them
in
the
future
as
he
uttered
these
words
of
lifelong
blessing
footsteps
sounded
in
the
courtyard
i
ran
downstairs
and
admitted
a
group
of
students
dear
brother
how
reluctant
we
are
to
disturb
master
at
this
hour
one
man
addressed
me
apologetically
we
made
a
mistake
about
train
schedules
but
felt
we
could
not
return
home
without
a
glimpse
of
our
guru
he
has
been
expecting
you
and
is
even
now
preparing
your
food
sri
yukteswar
welcoming
voice
rang
out
i
led
the
astonished
visitors
to
the
kitchen
master
turned
to
me
with
twinkling
eyes
now
that
you
have
finished
comparing
notes
no
doubt
you
are
satisfied
that
our
guests
really
did
miss
their
train
i
followed
him
to
his
bedroom
a
half
hour
later
realizing
fully
that
i
was
about
to
sleep
beside
a
godlike
guru
puri
about
miles
south
of
calcutta
is
a
famous
pilgrimage
city
for
devotees
of
krishna
his
worship
is
celebrated
there
with
two
immense
annual
festivals
snanayatra
and
rathayatra
the
discovery
of
a
radio
microscope
revealed
a
new
world
of
hitherto
unknown
rays
man
himself
as
well
as
all
kinds
of
supposedly
inert
matter
constantly
emits
the
rays
that
this
instrument
reported
the
associated
press
those
who
believe
in
telepathy
second
sight
and
clairvoyance
have
in
this
announcement
the
first
scientific
proof
of
the
existence
of
invisible
rays
which
really
travel
from
one
person
to
another
the
radio
device
actually
is
a
radio
frequency
spectroscope
it
does
the
same
thing
for
cool
nonglowing
matter
that
the
spectroscope
does
when
it
discloses
the
kinds
of
atoms
that
make
the
stars
the
existence
of
such
rays
coming
from
man
and
all
living
things
has
been
suspected
by
scientists
for
many
years
today
is
the
first
experimental
proof
of
their
existence
the
discovery
shows
that
every
atom
and
every
molecule
in
nature
is
a
continuous
radio
broadcasting
station
thus
even
after
death
the
substance
that
was
a
man
continues
to
send
out
its
delicate
rays
the
wave
lengths
of
these
rays
range
from
shorter
than
anything
now
used
in
broadcasting
to
the
longest
kind
of
radio
waves
the
jumble
of
these
rays
is
almost
inconceivable
there
are
millions
of
them
a
single
very
large
molecule
may
give
off
different
wave
lengths
at
the
same
time
the
longer
wave
lengths
of
this
sort
travel
with
the
ease
and
speed
of
radio
waves
there
is
one
amazing
difference
between
the
new
radio
rays
and
familiar
rays
like
light
this
is
the
prolonged
time
amounting
to
thousands
of
years
which
these
radio
waves
will
keep
on
emitting
from
undisturbed

one
hesitates
to
use
intuition

almost
ruined
the

along
with
more
ambitious
devastations
the
latin

intuitional

why
do
you
get
an
astrological
armlet
should
i
master
i
do
believe
in
astrology
it
is
never
a
question
of
belief
the
only
scientific
attitude
one
can
take
on
any
subject
is
whether
it
is
true
the
law
of
gravitation
worked
as
efficiently
before
newton
as
after
him
the
cosmos
would
be
fairly
chaotic
if
its
laws
could
not
operate
without
the
sanction
of
human
belief
charlatans
have
brought
the
stellar
science
to
its
present
state
of
disrepute
astrology
is
too
vast
both
mathematically
and
philosophically
to
be
rightly
grasped
except
by
men
of
profound
understanding
if
ignoramuses
misread
the
heavens
and
see
there
a
scrawl
instead
of
a
script
that
is
to
be
expected
in
this
imperfect
world
one
should
not
dismiss
the
wisdom
with
the
all
parts
of
creation
are
linked
together
and
interchange
their
influences
the
balanced
rhythm
of
the
universe
is
rooted
in
reciprocity
my
guru
continued
man
in
his
human
aspect
has
to
combat
two
sets
of
the
tumults
within
his
being
caused
by
the
admixture
of
earth
water
fire
air
and
ethereal
elements
second
the
outer
disintegrating
powers
of
nature
so
long
as
man
struggles
with
his
mortality
he
is
affected
by
the
myriad
mutations
of
heaven
and
earth
astrology
is
the
study
of
man
response
to
planetary
stimuli
the
stars
have
no
conscious
benevolence
or
animosity
they
merely
send
forth
positive
and
negative
radiations
of
themselves
these
do
not
help
or
harm
humanity
but
offer
a
lawful
channel
for
the
outward
operation
of
equilibriums
which
each
man
has
set
into
motion
in
the
past
a
child
is
born
on
that
day
and
at
that
hour
when
the
celestial
rays
are
in
mathematical
harmony
with
his
individual
karma
his
horoscope
is
a
challenging
portrait
revealing
his
unalterable
past
and
its
probable
future
results
but
the
natal
chart
can
be
rightly
interpreted
only
by
men
of
intuitive
wisdom
these
are
few
the
message
boldly
blazoned
across
the
heavens
at
the
moment
of
birth
is
not
meant
to
emphasize
result
of
past
good
and
to
arouse
man
will
to
escape
from
his
universal
thralldom
what
he
has
done
he
can
undo
none
other
than
himself
was
the
instigator
of
the
causes
of
whatever
effects
are
now
prevalent
in
his
life
he
can
overcome
any
limitation
because
he
created
it
by
his
own
actions
in
the
first
place
and
because
he
has
spiritual
resources
which
are
not
subject
to
planetary
pressure
superstitious
awe
of
astrology
makes
one
an
automaton
slavishly
dependent
on
mechanical
guidance
the
wise
man
defeats
his
planets
which
is
to
say
his
transferring
his
allegiance
from
the
creation
to
the
creator
the
more
he
realizes
his
unity
with
spirit
the
less
he
can
be
dominated
by
matter
the
soul
is
it
is
deathless
because
birthless
it
can
not
be
regimented
by
stars
man
is
a
soul
and
has
a
body
when
he
properly
places
his
sense
of
identity
he
leaves
behind
all
compulsive
patterns
so
long
as
he
remains
confused
in
his
ordinary
state
of
spiritual
amnesia
he
will
know
the
subtle
fetters
of
environmental
law
god
is
harmony
the
devotee
who
attunes
himself
will
never
perform
any
action
amiss
his
activities
will
be
correctly
and
naturally
timed
to
accord
with
astrological
law
after
deep
prayer
and
meditation
he
is
in
touch
with
his
divine
consciousness
there
is
no
greater
power
than
that
inward
protection
then
dear
master
why
do
you
want
me
to
wear
an
astrological
bangle
i
ventured
this
question
after
a
long
silence
during
which
i
had
tried
to
assimilate
sri
yukteswar
noble
exposition
it
is
only
when
a
traveler
has
reached
his
goal
that
he
is
justified
in
discarding
his
maps
during
the
journey
he
takes
advantage
of
any
convenient
short
cut
the
ancient
rishis
discovered
many
ways
to
curtail
the
period
of
man
exile
in
delusion
there
are
certain
mechanical
features
in
the
law
of
karma
which
can
be
skillfully
adjusted
by
the
fingers
of
wisdom
all
human
ills
arise
from
some
transgression
of
universal
law
the
scriptures
point
out
that
man
must
satisfy
the
laws
of
nature
while
not
discrediting
the
divine
omnipotence
he
should
say
i
trust
in
thee
and
know
thou
canst
help
me
but
i
too
will
do
my
best
to
undo
any
wrong
i
have
done
by
a
number
of
prayer
by
will
power
by
yoga
meditation
by
consultation
with
saints
by
use
of
astrological
adverse
effects
of
past
wrongs
can
be
minimized
or
nullified
just
as
a
house
can
be
fitted
with
a
copper
rod
to
absorb
the
shock
of
lightning
so
the
bodily
temple
can
be
benefited
by
various
protective
measures
ages
ago
our
yogis
discovered
that
pure
metals
emit
an
astral
light
which
is
powerfully
counteractive
to
negative
pulls
of
the
planets
subtle
electrical
and
magnetic
radiations
are
constantly
circulating
in
the
universe
when
a
man
body
is
being
aided
he
does
not
know
it
when
it
is
being
disintegrated
he
is
still
in
ignorance
can
he
do
anything
about
it
this
problem
received
attention
from
our
rishis
they
found
helpful
not
only
a
combination
of
metals
but
also
of
plants
effective
of
jewels
of
not
less
than
two
carats
the
preventive
uses
of
astrology
have
seldom
been
seriously
studied
outside
of
india
one
fact
is
that
the
proper
jewels
metals
or
plant
preparations
are
valueless
unless
the
required
weight
is
secured
and
unless
these
remedial
agents
are
worn
next
to
the
skin
sir
of
course
i
shall
take
your
advice
and
get
a
bangle
i
am
intrigued
at
the
thought
of
outwitting
a
planet
for
general
purposes
i
counsel
the
use
of
an
armlet
made
of
gold
silver
and
copper
but
for
a
specific
purpose
i
want
you
to
get
one
of
silver
and
lead
sri
yukteswar
added
careful
directions
guruji
what
purpose
do
you
mean
the
stars
are
about
to
take
an
unfriendly
interest
in
you
mukunda
fear
not
you
shall
be
protected
in
about
a
month
your
liver
will
cause
you
much
trouble
the
illness
is
scheduled
to
last
for
six
months
but
your
use
of
an
astrological
armlet
will
shorten
the
period
to
days
i
sought
out
a
jeweler
the
next
day
and
was
soon
wearing
the
bangle
my
health
was
excellent
master
prediction
slipped
from
my
mind
he
left
serampore
to
visit
benares
thirty
days
after
our
conversation
i
felt
a
sudden
pain
in
the
region
of
my
liver
the
following
weeks
were
a
nightmare
of
excruciating
pain
reluctant
to
disturb
my
guru
i
thought
i
would
bravely
endure
my
trial
alone
but
days
of
torture
weakened
my
resolution
i
entrained
for
benares
there
sri
yukteswar
greeted
me
with
unusual
warmth
but
gave
me
no
opportunity
to
tell
him
my
woes
in
private
many
devotees
visited
master
that
day
just
for
a
darshan
ill
and
neglected
i
sat
in
a
corner
it
was
not
until
after
the
evening
meal
that
all
guests
had
departed
my
guru
summoned
me
to
the
octagonal
balcony
of
the
house
you
must
have
come
about
your
liver
disorder
sri
gaze
was
averted
he
walked
to
and
fro
occasionally
intercepting
the
moonlight
let
me
see
you
have
been
ailing
for
days
have
you
yes
sir
please
do
the
stomach
exercise
i
have
taught
you
if
you
knew
the
extent
of
my
suffering
master
you
would
not
ask
me
to
exercise
nevertheless
i
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
obey
him
you
say
you
have
pain
i
say
you
have
none
how
can
such
contradictions
exist
my
guru
looked
at
me
inquiringly
i
was
dazed
and
then
overcome
with
joyful
relief
no
longer
could
i
feel
the
continuous
torment
that
had
kept
me
nearly
sleepless
for
weeks
at
sri
yukteswar
words
the
agony
vanished
as
though
it
had
never
been
i
started
to
kneel
at
his
feet
in
gratitude
but
he
quickly
prevented
me
do
be
childish
get
up
and
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
moon
over
the
ganges
but
master
eyes
were
twinkling
happily
as
i
stood
in
silence
beside
him
i
understood
by
his
attitude
that
he
wanted
me
to
feel
that
not
he
but
god
had
been
the
healer
i
wear
even
now
the
heavy
silver
and
lead
bangle
a
memento
of
that
i
found
anew
that
i
was
living
with
a
personage
indeed
superhuman
on
later
occasions
when
i
brought
my
friends
to
sri
yukteswar
for
healing
he
invariably
recommended
jewels
or
the
bangle
extolling
their
use
as
an
act
of
astrological
wisdom
i
had
been
prejudiced
against
astrology
from
my
childhood
partly
because
i
observed
that
many
people
are
sequaciously
attached
to
it
and
partly
because
of
a
prediction
made
by
our
family
astrologer
you
will
marry
three
times
being
twice
a
widower
i
brooded
over
the
matter
feeling
like
a
goat
awaiting
sacrifice
before
the
temple
of
triple
matrimony
you
may
as
well
be
resigned
to
your
fate
my
brother
ananta
had
remarked
your
written
horoscope
has
correctly
stated
that
you
would
fly
from
home
toward
the
himalayas
during
your
early
years
but
would
be
forcibly
returned
the
forecast
of
your
marriages
is
also
bound
to
be
true
a
clear
intuition
came
to
me
one
night
that
the
prophecy
was
wholly
false
i
set
fire
to
the
horoscope
scroll
placing
the
ashes
in
a
paper
bag
on
which
i
wrote
seeds
of
past
karma
can
not
germinate
if
they
are
roasted
in
the
divine
fires
of
wisdom
i
put
the
bag
in
a
conspicuous
spot
ananta
immediately
read
my
defiant
comment
you
can
not
destroy
truth
as
easily
as
you
have
burnt
this
paper
scroll
my
brother
laughed
scornfully
it
is
a
fact
that
on
three
occasions
before
i
reached
manhood
my
family
tried
to
arrange
my
betrothal
each
time
i
refused
to
fall
in
with
the
plans
knowing
that
my
love
for
god
was
more
overwhelming
than
any
astrological
persuasion
from
the
past
the
deeper
the
of
a
man
the
more
he
influences
the
whole
universe
by
his
subtle
spiritual
vibrations
and
the
less
he
himself
is
affected
by
the
phenomenal
flux
these
words
of
master
often
returned
inspiringly
to
my
mind
occasionally
i
told
astrologers
to
select
my
worst
periods
according
to
planetary
indications
and
i
would
still
accomplish
whatever
task
i
set
myself
it
is
true
that
my
success
at
such
times
has
been
accompanied
by
extraordinary
difficulties
but
my
conviction
has
always
been
justified
faith
in
the
divine
protection
and
the
right
use
of
man
will
are
forces
formidable
beyond
any
the
inverted
bowl
can
muster
the
starry
inscription
at
one
birth
i
came
to
understand
is
not
that
man
is
a
puppet
of
his
past
its
message
is
rather
a
prod
to
pride
the
very
heavens
seek
to
arouse
man
determination
to
be
free
from
every
limitation
god
created
each
man
as
a
soul
dowered
with
individuality
hence
essential
to
the
universal
structure
whether
in
the
temporary
role
of
pillar
or
parasite
his
freedom
is
final
and
immediate
if
he
so
wills
it
depends
not
on
outer
but
inner
victories
sri
yukteswar
discovered
the
mathematical
application
of
a
equinoctial
cycle
to
our
present
age
the
cycle
is
divided
into
an
ascending
arc
and
a
descending
arc
each
of
years
within
each
arc
fall
four
yugas
or
ages
called
kali
dwapara
treta
and
satya
corresponding
to
the
greek
ideas
of
iron
bronze
silver
and
golden
ages
my
guru
determined
by
various
calculations
that
the
last
kali
yuga
or
iron
age
of
the
ascending
arc
started
about
the
iron
age
years
in
duration
is
a
span
of
materialism
it
ended
about
that
year
ushered
in
dwapara
yuga
a
period
of
electrical
and
developments
the
age
of
telegraph
radio
airplanes
and
other
the
period
of
treta
yuga
will
start
in
its
age
will
be
marked
by
common
knowledge
of
telepathic
communications
and
other
during
the
years
of
satya
yuga
final
age
in
an
ascending
arc
the
intelligence
of
a
man
will
be
completely
developed
he
will
work
in
harmony
with
the
divine
plan
a
descending
arc
of
years
starting
with
a
descending
golden
age
of
years
then
begins
for
the
world
man
gradually
sinks
into
ignorance
these
cycles
are
the
eternal
rounds
of
maya
the
contrasts
and
relativities
of
the
phenomenal
universe
man
one
by
one
escapes
from
creation
prison
of
duality
as
he
awakens
to
consciousness
of
his
inseverable
divine
unity
with
the
creator
master
enlarged
my
understanding
not
only
of
astrology
but
of
the
world
scriptures
placing
the
holy
texts
on
the
spotless
table
of
his
mind
he
was
able
to
dissect
them
with
the
scalpel
of
intuitive
reasoning
and
to
separate
errors
and
interpolations
of
scholars
from
the
truths
as
originally
expressed
by
the
prophets
fix
one
vision
on
the
end
of
the
nose
this
inaccurate
interpretation
of
a
bhagavad
gita
stanza
widely
accepted
by
eastern
pundits
and
western
translators
used
to
arouse
droll
criticism
the
path
of
a
yogi
is
singular
enough
as
it
is
he
remarked
why
counsel
him
that
he
must
also
make
himself
the
true
meaning
of
nasikagram
is
of
the
nose
not
of
the
nose
the
nose
begins
at
the
point
between
the
two
eyebrows
the
seat
of
spiritual
vision
because
of
one
sankhya
aphorism
a
lord
of
creation
can
not
be
deduced
or
god
is
not
proved
many
scholars
call
the
whole
philosophy
atheistical
the
verse
is
not
nihilistic
sri
yukteswar
explained
it
merely
signifies
that
to
the
unenlightened
man
dependent
on
his
senses
for
all
final
judgments
proof
of
god
must
remain
unknown
and
therefore
true
sankhya
followers
with
unshakable
insight
born
of
meditation
understand
that
the
lord
is
both
existent
and
knowable
master
expounded
the
christian
bible
with
a
beautiful
clarity
it
was
from
my
hindu
guru
unknown
to
the
roll
call
of
christian
membership
that
i
learned
to
perceive
the
deathless
essence
of
the
bible
and
to
understand
the
truth
in
christ
the
most
thrillingly
intransigent
ever
uttered
heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
away
the
great
masters
of
india
mold
their
lives
by
the
same
godly
ideals
which
animated
jesus
these
men
are
his
proclaimed
kin
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
same
is
my
brother
and
sister
and
mother
if
ye
continue
in
my
word
christ
pointed
out
then
are
ye
my
disciples
indeed
and
ye
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
freemen
all
lords
of
themselves
the
of
india
are
part
of
the
immortal
fraternity
those
who
have
attained
a
liberating
knowledge
of
the
one
father
the
adam
and
eve
story
is
incomprehensible
to
me
i
observed
with
considerable
heat
one
day
in
my
early
struggles
with
the
allegory
why
did
god
punish
not
only
the
guilty
pair
but
also
the
innocent
unborn
generations
master
was
more
amused
by
my
vehemence
than
my
ignorance
genesis
is
deeply
symbolic
and
can
not
be
grasped
by
a
literal
interpretation
he
explained
its
of
life
is
the
human
body
the
spinal
cord
is
like
an
upturned
tree
with
man
hair
as
its
roots
and
afferent
and
efferent
nerves
as
branches
the
tree
of
the
nervous
system
bears
many
enjoyable
fruits
or
sensations
of
sight
sound
smell
taste
and
touch
in
these
man
may
rightfully
indulge
but
he
was
forbidden
the
experience
of
sex
the
at
the
center
of
the
bodily
garden
the
represents
the
spinal
energy
which
stimulates
the
sex
nerves
is
reason
and
is
feeling
when
the
emotion
or
in
any
human
being
is
overpowered
by
the
sex
impulse
his
reason
or
adam
also
succumbs
god
created
the
human
species
by
materializing
the
bodies
of
man
and
woman
through
the
force
of
his
will
he
endowed
the
new
species
with
the
power
to
create
children
in
a
similar
or
divine
manner
because
his
manifestation
in
the
individualized
soul
had
hitherto
been
limited
to
animals
and
lacking
the
potentialities
of
full
reason
god
made
the
first
human
bodies
symbolically
called
adam
and
eve
to
these
for
advantageous
upward
evolution
he
transferred
the
souls
or
divine
essence
of
two
animals
in
adam
or
man
reason
predominated
in
eve
or
woman
feeling
was
ascendant
thus
was
expressed
the
duality
or
polarity
which
underlies
the
phenomenal
worlds
reason
and
feeling
remain
in
a
heaven
of
cooperative
joy
so
long
as
the
human
mind
is
not
tricked
by
the
serpentine
energy
of
animal
propensities
the
human
body
was
therefore
not
solely
a
result
of
evolution
from
beasts
but
was
produced
by
an
act
of
special
creation
by
god
the
animal
forms
were
too
crude
to
express
full
divinity
the
human
being
was
uniquely
given
a
tremendous
mental
lotus
of
the
well
as
acutely
awakened
occult
centers
in
the
spine
god
or
the
divine
consciousness
present
within
the
first
created
pair
counseled
them
to
enjoy
all
human
sensibilities
but
not
to
put
their
concentration
on
touch
sensations
these
were
banned
in
order
to
avoid
the
development
of
the
sex
organs
which
would
enmesh
humanity
in
the
inferior
animal
method
of
propagation
the
warning
not
to
revive
bestial
memories
was
not
heeded
resuming
the
way
of
brute
procreation
adam
and
eve
fell
from
the
state
of
heavenly
joy
natural
to
the
original
perfect
man
knowledge
of
and
evil
refers
to
the
cosmic
dualistic
compulsion
falling
under
the
sway
of
maya
through
misuse
of
his
feeling
and
reason
or
man
relinquishes
his
right
to
enter
the
heavenly
garden
of
divine
the
personal
responsibility
of
every
human
being
is
to
restore
his
or
dual
nature
to
a
unified
harmony
or
eden
as
sri
yukteswar
ended
his
discourse
i
glanced
with
new
respect
at
the
pages
of
genesis
dear
master
i
said
for
the
first
time
i
feel
a
proper
filial
obligation
toward
adam
and
eve
from
astronomical
references
in
ancient
hindu
scriptures
scholars
have
been
able
to
correctly
ascertain
the
dates
of
the
authors
the
scientific
knowledge
of
the
rishis
was
very
great
in
the
kaushitaki
brahmana
we
find
precise
astronomical
passages
which
show
that
in
the
hindus
were
far
advanced
in
astronomy
which
had
a
practical
value
in
determining
the
auspicious
times
for
astrological
ceremonies
in
an
article
in
february
the
following
summary
is
given
of
the
jyotish
or
body
of
vedic
astronomical
treatises
it
contains
the
scientific
lore
which
kept
india
at
the
forefront
of
all
ancient
nations
and
made
her
the
mecca
of
seekers
after
knowledge
the
very
ancient
brahmagupta
one
of
the
jyotish
works
is
an
astronomical
treatise
dealing
with
such
matters
as
the
heliocentric
motion
of
the
planetary
bodies
in
our
solar
system
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
the
spherical
form
the
reflected
light
of
the
moon
the
earth
daily
axial
revolution
the
presence
of
fixed
stars
in
the
milky
way
the
law
of
gravitation
and
other
scientific
facts
which
did
not
dawn
in
the
western
world
until
the
time
of
copernicus
and
newton
it
is
now
that
the
arabic
numerals
without
whose
symbols
advanced
mathematics
is
difficult
came
to
europe
in
the
century
via
the
arabs
from
india
where
that
system
of
notation
had
been
anciently
formulated
further
light
on
vast
scientific
heritage
will
be
found
in
ray

of
hindu
chemistry
and
in

of
thirteen
articles
on
the
historical
verification
of
sri
yukteswar
yuga
theory
appeared
in
the
magazine
los
angeles
from
september
to
september
in
the
year
the
hindu
scriptures
place
the
present
as
occurring
within
the
kali
yuga
of
a
much
longer
universal
cycle
than
the
simple
equinoctial
cycle
with
which
sri
yukteswar
was
concerned
the
universal
cycle
of
the
scriptures
is
years
in
extent
and
measures
out
a
day
of
creation
or
the
length
of
life
assigned
to
our
planetary
system
in
its
present
form
this
vast
figure
given
by
the
rishis
is
based
on
a
relationship
between
the
length
of
the
solar
year
and
a
multiple
of
pi
the
ratio
of
the
circumference
to
the
diameter
of
a
circle
the
life
span
for
a
whole
universe
according
to
the
ancient
seers
is
solar
years
or
one
age
of
brahma
scientists
estimate
the
present
age
of
the
earth
to
be
about
two
billion
years
basing
their
conclusions
on
a
study
of
lead
pockets
left
as
a
result
of
radioactivity
in

the
hindu
scriptures
declare
that
an
earth
such
as
ours
is
dissolved
for
one
of
two
reasons
the
inhabitants
as
a
whole
become
either
completely
good

completely
evil
the
thus
generates
a

dire
pronouncements

occasionally
published
regarding

the
latest

was
given
by

chas

of
pasadena
who
publicly
set
the

for

reporters
asked
my
opinion
i
explained
that
world
cycles
follow
an
orderly
progression
according

no

two

are

in
store
for
our

in

the
figures
given

lest
ye
die
the
woman
whom
thou
gavest
to
be
with
me
she
gave
me
of
the
tree
and
i
did
eat
the
woman
said
the
serpent
beguiled
me
and
i
did
so
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
male
and
female
created
he
them
and
god
blessed
them
and
god
said
unto
them
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
and
the
lord
god
formed
man
of
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
man
became
a
living
now
the
serpent
sex
force
was
more
subtil
than
any
beast
of
the
field
any
other
sense
of
the
body
and
the
lord
god
planted
a
garden
eastward
in
eden
and
there
he
put
the
man
whom
he
had
therefore
the
lord
god
sent
him
forth
from
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
ground
from
whence
he
was
the
divine
man
first
made
by
god
had
his
consciousness
centered
in
the
omnipotent
single
eye
in
the
forehead
eastward
the
powers
of
his
will
focused
at
that
spot
were
lost
to
man
when
he
began
to
till
the
ground
of
his
physical
nature
chapter
sasi
and
the
three
sapphires
because
you
and
my
son
think
so
highly
of
swami
sri
yukteswar
i
will
take
a
look
at
him
the
tone
of
voice
used
by
narayan
chunder
roy
implied
that
he
was
humoring
the
whim
of
i
concealed
my
indignation
in
the
best
traditions
of
the
proselyter
my
companion
a
veterinary
surgeon
was
a
confirmed
agnostic
his
young
son
santosh
had
implored
me
to
take
an
interest
in
his
father
so
far
my
invaluable
aid
had
been
a
bit
on
the
invisible
side
roy
accompanied
me
the
following
day
to
the
serampore
hermitage
after
master
had
granted
him
a
brief
interview
marked
for
the
most
part
by
stoic
silence
on
both
sides
the
visitor
brusquely
departed
why
bring
a
dead
man
to
the
ashram
sri
yukteswar
looked
at
me
inquiringly
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
on
the
calcutta
skeptic
sir
the
doctor
is
very
much
alive
but
in
a
short
time
he
will
be
dead
i
was
shocked
sir
this
will
be
a
terrible
blow
to
his
son
santosh
yet
hopes
for
time
to
change
his
father
materialistic
views
i
beseech
you
master
to
help
the
man
very
well
for
your
sake
my
guru
face
was
impassive
the
proud
horse
doctor
is
far
gone
in
diabetes
although
he
does
not
know
it
in
fifteen
days
he
will
take
to
his
bed
the
physicians
will
give
him
up
for
lost
his
natural
time
to
leave
this
earth
is
six
weeks
from
today
due
to
your
intercession
however
on
that
date
he
will
recover
but
there
is
one
condition
you
must
get
him
to
wear
an
astrological
bangle
he
will
doubtless
object
as
violently
as
one
of
his
horses
before
an
operation
master
chuckled
after
a
silence
during
which
i
wondered
how
santosh
and
i
could
best
employ
the
arts
of
cajolery
on
the
recalcitrant
doctor
sri
yukteswar
made
further
disclosures
as
soon
as
the
man
gets
well
advise
him
not
to
eat
meat
he
will
not
heed
this
counsel
however
and
in
six
months
just
as
he
is
feeling
at
his
best
he
will
drop
dead
even
that
extension
of
life
is
granted
him
only
because
of
your
plea
the
following
day
i
suggested
to
santosh
that
he
order
an
armlet
at
the
jeweler
it
was
ready
in
a
week
but
roy
refused
to
put
it
on
i
am
in
the
best
of
health
you
will
never
impress
me
with
these
astrological
superstitions
the
doctor
glanced
at
me
belligerently
i
recalled
with
amusement
that
master
had
justifiably
compared
the
man
to
a
balky
horse
another
seven
days
passed
the
doctor
suddenly
ill
meekly
consented
to
wear
the
bangle
two
weeks
later
the
physician
in
attendance
told
me
that
his
patient
case
was
hopeless
he
supplied
harrowing
details
of
the
ravages
inflicted
by
diabetes
i
shook
my
head
my
guru
has
said
that
after
a
sickness
lasting
one
month
roy
will
be
well
the
physician
stared
at
me
incredulously
but
he
sought
me
out
a
fortnight
later
with
an
apologetic
air
roy
has
made
a
complete
recovery
he
exclaimed
it
is
the
most
amazing
case
in
my
experience
never
before
have
i
seen
a
dying
man
show
such
an
inexplicable
comeback
your
guru
must
indeed
be
a
healing
prophet
after
one
interview
with
roy
during
which
i
repeated
sri
yukteswar
advice
about
a
meatless
diet
i
did
not
see
the
man
again
for
six
months
he
stopped
for
a
chat
one
evening
as
i
sat
on
the
piazza
of
my
family
home
on
gurpar
road
tell
your
teacher
that
by
eating
meat
frequently
i
have
wholly
regained
my
strength
his
unscientific
ideas
on
diet
have
not
influenced
me
it
was
true
that
roy
looked
a
picture
of
health
but
the
next
day
santosh
came
running
to
me
from
his
home
on
the
next
block
this
morning
father
dropped
dead
this
case
was
one
of
my
strangest
experiences
with
master
he
healed
the
rebellious
veterinary
surgeon
in
spite
of
his
disbelief
and
extended
the
man
natural
term
on
earth
by
six
months
just
because
of
my
earnest
supplication
sri
yukteswar
was
boundless
in
his
kindness
when
confronted
by
the
urgent
prayer
of
a
devotee
it
was
my
proudest
privilege
to
bring
college
friends
to
meet
my
guru
many
of
them
would
lay
least
in
the
ashram
fashionable
academic
cloak
of
religious
skepticism
one
of
my
friends
sasi
spent
a
number
of
happy
week
ends
in
serampore
master
became
immensely
fond
of
the
boy
and
lamented
that
his
private
life
was
wild
and
disorderly
sasi
unless
you
reform
one
year
hence
you
will
be
dangerously
sri
yukteswar
gazed
at
my
friend
with
affectionate
exasperation
mukunda
is
the
witness
do
say
later
that
i
did
warn
you
sasi
laughed
master
i
will
leave
it
to
you
to
interest
a
sweet
charity
of
cosmos
in
my
own
sad
case
my
spirit
is
willing
but
my
will
is
weak
you
are
my
only
savior
on
earth
i
believe
in
nothing
else
at
least
you
should
wear
a
blue
sapphire
it
will
help
you
i
ca
afford
one
anyhow
dear
guruji
if
trouble
comes
i
fully
believe
you
will
protect
me
in
a
year
you
will
bring
three
sapphires
sri
yukteswar
replied
cryptically
they
will
be
of
no
use
then
variations
on
this
conversation
took
place
regularly
i
reform
sasi
would
say
in
comical
despair
and
my
trust
in
you
master
is
more
precious
to
me
than
any
stone
a
year
later
i
was
visiting
my
guru
at
the
calcutta
home
of
his
disciple
naren
babu
about
ten
in
the
morning
as
sri
yukteswar
and
i
were
sitting
quietly
in
the
parlor
i
heard
the
front
door
open
master
straightened
stiffly
it
is
that
sasi
he
remarked
gravely
the
year
is
now
up
both
his
lungs
are
gone
he
has
ignored
my
counsel
tell
him
i
want
to
see
him
half
stunned
by
sri
yukteswar
sternness
i
raced
down
the
stairway
sasi
was
ascending
o
mukunda
i
do
hope
master
is
here
i
had
a
hunch
he
might
be
yes
but
he
does
wish
to
be
disturbed
sasi
burst
into
tears
and
brushed
past
me
he
threw
himself
at
sri
yukteswar
feet
placing
there
three
beautiful
sapphires
omniscient
guru
the
doctors
say
i
have
galloping
tuberculosis
they
give
me
no
longer
than
three
more
months
i
humbly
implore
your
aid
i
know
you
can
heal
me
is
it
a
bit
late
now
to
be
worrying
over
your
life
depart
with
your
jewels
their
time
of
usefulness
is
past
master
then
sat
sphinxlike
in
an
unrelenting
silence
punctuated
by
the
sobs
for
mercy
an
intuitive
conviction
came
to
me
that
sri
yukteswar
was
merely
testing
the
depth
of
sasi
faith
in
the
divine
healing
power
i
was
not
surprised
a
tense
hour
later
when
master
turned
a
sympathetic
gaze
on
my
prostrate
friend
get
up
sasi
what
a
commotion
you
make
in
other
people
houses
return
your
sapphires
to
the
jeweler
they
are
an
unnecessary
expense
now
but
get
an
astrological
bangle
and
wear
it
fear
not
in
a
few
weeks
you
shall
be
well
sasi
smile
illumined
his
face
like
sudden
sun
over
a
sodden
landscape
beloved
guru
shall
i
take
the
medicines
prescribed
by
the
doctors
sri
yukteswar
glance
was
longanimous
just
as
you
them
or
discard
them
it
does
not
matter
it
is
more
possible
for
the
sun
and
moon
to
interchange
their
positions
than
for
you
to
die
of
tuberculosis
he
added
abruptly
go
now
before
i
change
my
mind
with
an
agitated
bow
my
friend
hastily
departed
i
visited
him
several
times
during
the
next
few
weeks
and
was
aghast
to
find
his
condition
increasingly
worse
sasi
can
not
last
through
the
night
these
words
from
his
physician
and
the
spectacle
of
my
friend
now
reduced
almost
to
a
skeleton
sent
me
posthaste
to
serampore
my
guru
listened
coldly
to
my
tearful
report
why
do
you
come
here
to
bother
me
you
have
already
heard
me
assure
sasi
of
his
recovery
i
bowed
before
him
in
great
awe
and
retreated
to
the
door
sri
yukteswar
said
no
parting
word
but
sank
into
silence
his
unwinking
eyes
their
vision
fled
to
another
world
i
returned
at
once
to
sasi
home
in
calcutta
with
astonishment
i
found
my
friend
sitting
up
drinking
milk
o
mukunda
what
a
miracle
four
hours
ago
i
felt
master
presence
in
the
room
my
terrible
symptoms
immediately
disappeared
i
feel
that
through
his
grace
i
am
entirely
well
in
a
few
weeks
sasi
was
stouter
and
in
better
health
than
ever
before
but
his
singular
reaction
to
his
healing
had
an
ungrateful
tinge
he
seldom
visited
sri
yukteswar
again
my
friend
told
me
one
day
that
he
so
deeply
regretted
his
previous
mode
of
life
that
he
was
ashamed
to
face
master
i
could
only
conclude
that
sasi
illness
had
had
the
contrasting
effect
of
stiffening
his
will
and
impairing
his
manners
the
first
two
years
of
my
course
at
scottish
church
college
were
drawing
to
a
close
my
classroom
attendance
had
been
very
spasmodic
what
little
studying
i
did
was
only
to
keep
peace
with
my
family
my
two
private
tutors
came
regularly
to
my
house
i
was
regularly
absent
i
can
discern
at
least
this
one
regularity
in
my
scholastic
career
in
india
two
successful
years
of
college
bring
an
intermediate
arts
diploma
the
student
may
then
look
forward
to
another
two
years
and
his
degree
the
intermediate
arts
final
examinations
loomed
ominously
ahead
i
fled
to
puri
where
my
guru
was
spending
a
few
weeks
vaguely
hoping
that
he
would
sanction
my
nonappearance
at
the
finals
i
related
my
embarrassing
unpreparedness
but
master
smiled
consolingly
you
have
wholeheartedly
pursued
your
spiritual
duties
and
could
not
help
neglecting
your
college
work
apply
yourself
diligently
to
your
books
for
the
next
week
you
shall
get
through
your
ordeal
without
failure
i
returned
to
calcutta
firmly
suppressing
all
reasonable
doubts
that
occasionally
arose
with
unnerving
ridicule
surveying
the
mountain
of
books
on
my
table
i
felt
like
a
traveler
lost
in
a
wilderness
a
long
period
of
meditation
brought
me
a
inspiration
opening
each
book
at
random
i
studied
only
those
pages
which
lay
thus
exposed
pursuing
this
course
during
eighteen
hours
a
day
for
a
week
i
considered
myself
entitled
to
advise
all
succeeding
generations
on
the
art
of
cramming
the
following
days
in
the
examination
halls
were
a
justification
of
my
seemingly
haphazard
procedure
i
passed
all
the
tests
though
by
a
hairbreadth
the
congratulations
of
my
friends
and
family
were
ludicrously
mixed
with
ejaculations
betraying
their
astonishment
on
his
return
from
puri
sri
yukteswar
gave
me
a
pleasant
surprise
your
calcutta
studies
are
now
over
i
will
see
that
you
pursue
your
last
two
years
of
university
work
right
here
in
serampore
i
was
puzzled
sir
there
is
no
bachelor
of
arts
course
in
this
town
serampore
college
the
sole
institution
of
higher
learning
offered
only
a
course
in
intermediate
arts
master
smiled
mischievously
i
am
too
old
to
go
about
collecting
donations
to
establish
an
college
for
you
i
guess
i
shall
have
to
arrange
the
matter
through
someone
else
two
months
later
professor
howells
president
of
serampore
college
publicly
announced
that
he
had
succeeded
in
raising
sufficient
funds
to
offer
a
course
serampore
college
became
a
branch
affiliation
of
the
university
of
calcutta
i
was
one
of
the
first
students
to
enroll
in
serampore
as
an
candidate
guruji
how
kind
you
are
to
me
i
have
been
longing
to
leave
calcutta
and
be
near
you
every
day
in
serampore
professor
howells
does
not
dream
how
much
he
owes
to
your
silent
help
sri
yukteswar
gazed
at
me
with
mock
severity
now
you
wo
have
to
spend
so
many
hours
on
trains
what
a
lot
of
free
time
for
your
studies
perhaps
you
will
become
less
of
a
crammer
and
more
of
a
scholar
but
somehow
his
tone
lacked
conviction
in
i
heard
from
a
friend
that
sasi
was
still
in
excellent
health
chapter
a
mohammedan
years
ago
right
in
this
very
room
you
now
occupy
a
mohammedan
performed
four
miracles
before
me
sri
yukteswar
made
this
surprising
statement
during
his
first
visit
to
my
new
quarters
immediately
after
entering
serampore
college
i
had
taken
a
room
in
a
boardinghouse
called
panthi
it
was
an
brick
mansion
fronting
the
ganges
master
what
a
coincidence
are
these
newly
decorated
walls
really
ancient
with
memories
i
looked
around
my
simply
furnished
room
with
awakened
interest
it
is
a
long
story
my
guru
smiled
reminiscently
the
name
of
the
fakir
was
afzal
khan
he
had
acquired
his
extraordinary
powers
through
a
chance
encounter
with
a
hindu
yogi
i
am
thirsty
fetch
me
some
water
a
sannyasi
made
this
request
of
afzal
one
day
during
his
early
boyhood
in
a
small
village
of
eastern
bengal
i
am
a
mohammedan
how
could
you
a
hindu
accept
a
drink
from
my
hands
truthfulness
pleases
me
my
child
i
do
not
observe
the
ostracizing
rules
of
ungodly
sectarianism
go
bring
me
water
quickly
afzal
reverent
obedience
was
rewarded
by
a
loving
glance
from
the
yogi
possess
good
karma
from
former
lives
he
observed
solemnly
am
going
to
teach
you
a
certain
yoga
method
which
will
give
you
command
over
one
of
the
invisible
realms
the
great
powers
that
will
be
yours
should
be
exercised
for
worthy
ends
never
employ
them
selfishly
i
perceive
alas
that
you
have
brought
over
from
the
past
some
seeds
of
destructive
tendencies
do
not
allow
them
to
sprout
by
watering
them
with
fresh
evil
actions
the
complexity
of
your
previous
karma
is
such
that
you
must
use
this
life
to
reconcile
your
yogic
accomplishments
with
the
highest
humanitarian
goals
after
instructing
the
amazed
boy
in
a
complicated
technique
the
master
vanished
afzal
faithfully
followed
his
yoga
exercise
for
twenty
years
his
miraculous
feats
began
to
attract
widespread
attention
it
seems
that
he
was
always
accompanied
by
a
disembodied
spirit
whom
he
called
this
invisible
entity
was
able
to
fulfill
the
slightest
wish
ignoring
his
master
warning
afzal
began
to
misuse
his
powers
whatever
object
he
touched
and
then
replaced
would
soon
disappear
without
a
trace
this
disconcerting
eventuality
usually
made
the
mohammedan
an
objectionable
guest
he
visited
large
jewelry
stores
in
calcutta
from
time
to
time
representing
himself
as
a
possible
purchaser
any
jewel
he
handled
would
vanish
shortly
after
he
had
left
the
shop
afzal
was
often
surrounded
by
several
hundred
students
attracted
by
the
hope
of
learning
his
secrets
the
fakir
occasionally
invited
them
to
travel
with
him
at
the
railway
station
he
would
manage
to
touch
a
roll
of
tickets
these
he
would
return
to
the
clerk
remarking
have
changed
my
mind
and
wo
buy
them
now
but
when
he
boarded
the
train
with
his
retinue
afzal
would
be
in
possession
of
the
required
tickets
these
exploits
created
an
indignant
uproar
bengali
jewelers
and
were
succumbing
to
nervous
breakdowns
the
police
who
sought
to
arrest
afzal
found
themselves
helpless
the
fakir
could
remove
incriminating
evidence
merely
by
saying
take
this
away
sri
yukteswar
rose
from
his
seat
and
walked
to
the
balcony
of
my
room
which
overlooked
the
ganges
i
followed
him
eager
to
hear
more
of
the
baffling
mohammedan
raffles
this
panthi
house
formerly
belonged
to
a
friend
of
mine
he
became
acquainted
with
afzal
and
asked
him
here
my
friend
also
invited
about
twenty
neighbors
including
myself
i
was
only
a
youth
then
and
felt
a
lively
curiosity
about
the
notorious
fakir
master
laughed
i
took
the
precaution
of
not
wearing
anything
valuable
afzal
looked
me
over
inquisitively
then
remarked
have
powerful
hands
go
downstairs
to
the
garden
get
a
smooth
stone
and
write
your
name
on
it
with
chalk
then
throw
the
stone
as
far
as
possible
into
the
ganges
i
obeyed
as
soon
as
the
stone
had
vanished
under
distant
waves
the
mohammedan
addressed
me
again
a
pot
with
ganges
water
near
the
front
of
this
house
after
i
had
returned
with
a
vessel
of
water
the
fakir
cried
put
the
stone
in
the
pot
the
stone
appeared
at
once
i
pulled
it
from
the
vessel
and
found
my
signature
as
legible
as
when
i
had
written
it
babu
one
of
my
friends
in
the
room
was
wearing
a
heavy
antique
gold
watch
and
chain
the
fakir
examined
them
with
ominous
admiration
soon
they
were
missing
please
return
my
prized
heirloom
babu
was
nearly
in
tears
the
mohammedan
was
stoically
silent
for
awhile
then
said
have
five
hundred
rupees
in
an
iron
safe
bring
them
to
me
and
i
will
tell
you
where
to
locate
your
timepiece
the
distraught
babu
left
immediately
for
his
home
he
came
back
shortly
and
handed
afzal
the
required
sum
to
the
little
bridge
near
your
house
the
fakir
instructed
babu
on
hazrat
to
give
you
the
watch
and
chain
babu
rushed
away
on
his
return
he
was
wearing
a
smile
of
relief
and
no
jewelry
whatever
i
commanded
hazrat
as
directed
he
announced
watch
came
tumbling
down
from
the
air
into
my
right
hand
you
may
be
sure
i
locked
the
heirloom
in
my
safe
before
rejoining
the
group
here
babu
friends
witnesses
of
the
comicotragedy
of
the
ransom
for
a
watch
were
staring
with
resentment
at
afzal
he
now
spoke
placatingly
name
any
drink
you
want
hazrat
will
produce
it
a
number
asked
for
milk
others
for
fruit
juices
i
was
not
too
much
shocked
when
the
unnerved
babu
requested
whisky
the
mohammedan
gave
an
order
the
obliging
hazrat
sent
sealed
containers
sailing
down
the
air
and
thudding
to
the
floor
each
man
found
his
desired
beverage
the
promise
of
the
fourth
spectacular
feat
of
the
day
was
doubtless
gratifying
to
our
host
afzal
offered
to
supply
an
instantaneous
lunch
us
order
the
most
expensive
dishes
babu
suggested
gloomily
want
an
elaborate
meal
for
my
five
hundred
rupees
everything
should
be
served
on
gold
plates
as
soon
as
each
man
had
expressed
his
preferences
the
fakir
addressed
himself
to
the
inexhaustible
hazrat
a
great
rattle
ensued
gold
platters
filled
with
curries
hot
luchis
and
many
fruits
landed
from
nowhere
at
our
feet
all
the
food
was
delicious
after
feasting
for
an
hour
we
started
to
leave
the
room
a
tremendous
noise
as
though
dishes
were
being
piled
up
caused
us
to
turn
around
lo
there
was
no
sign
of
the
glittering
plates
or
the
remnants
of
the
meal
guruji
i
interrupted
if
afzal
could
easily
secure
such
things
as
gold
dishes
why
did
he
covet
the
property
of
others
the
fakir
was
not
highly
developed
spiritually
sri
yukteswar
explained
his
mastery
of
a
certain
yoga
technique
gave
him
access
to
an
astral
plane
where
any
desire
is
immediately
materialized
through
the
agency
of
an
astral
being
hazrat
the
mohammedan
could
summon
the
atoms
of
any
object
from
etheric
energy
by
an
act
of
powerful
will
but
such
objects
are
structurally
evanescent
they
can
not
be
long
retained
afzal
still
yearned
for
worldly
wealth
which
though
more
hardly
earned
has
a
more
dependable
durability
i
laughed
it
too
sometimes
vanishes
most
unaccountably
afzal
was
not
a
man
of
master
went
on
miracles
of
a
permanent
and
beneficial
nature
are
performed
by
true
saints
because
they
have
attuned
themselves
to
the
omnipotent
creator
afzal
was
merely
an
ordinary
man
with
an
extraordinary
power
of
penetrating
a
subtle
realm
not
usually
entered
by
mortals
until
death
i
understand
now
guruji
the
appears
to
have
some
charming
features
master
agreed
i
never
saw
afzal
after
that
day
but
a
few
years
later
babu
came
to
my
home
to
show
me
a
newspaper
account
of
the
mohammedan
public
confession
from
it
i
learned
the
facts
i
have
just
told
you
about
afzal
early
initiation
from
a
hindu
guru
the
gist
of
the
latter
part
of
the
published
document
as
recalled
by
sri
yukteswar
was
as
follows
i
afzal
khan
am
writing
these
words
as
an
act
of
penance
and
as
a
warning
to
those
who
seek
the
possession
of
miraculous
powers
for
years
i
have
been
misusing
the
wondrous
abilities
imparted
to
me
through
the
grace
of
god
and
my
master
i
became
drunk
with
egotism
feeling
that
i
was
beyond
the
ordinary
laws
of
morality
my
day
of
reckoning
finally
arrived
recently
i
met
an
old
man
on
a
road
outside
calcutta
he
limped
along
painfully
carrying
a
shining
object
which
looked
like
gold
i
addressed
him
with
greed
in
my
heart
am
afzal
khan
the
great
fakir
what
have
you
there
ball
of
gold
is
my
sole
material
wealth
it
can
be
of
no
interest
to
a
fakir
i
implore
you
sir
to
heal
my
limp
i
touched
the
ball
and
walked
away
without
reply
the
old
man
hobbled
after
me
he
soon
raised
an
outcry
gold
is
gone
as
i
paid
no
attention
he
suddenly
spoke
in
a
stentorian
voice
that
issued
oddly
from
his
frail
body
you
not
recognize
me
i
stood
speechless
aghast
at
the
belated
discovery
that
this
unimpressive
old
cripple
was
none
other
than
the
great
saint
who
long
long
ago
had
initiated
me
into
yoga
he
straightened
himself
his
body
instantly
became
strong
and
youthful
my
guru
glance
was
fiery
see
with
my
own
eyes
that
you
use
your
powers
not
to
help
suffering
humanity
but
to
prey
on
it
like
a
common
thief
i
withdraw
your
occult
gifts
hazrat
is
now
freed
from
you
no
longer
shall
you
be
a
terror
in
bengal
i
called
on
hazrat
in
anguished
tones
for
the
first
time
he
did
not
appear
to
my
inner
sight
but
some
dark
veil
suddenly
lifted
within
me
i
saw
clearly
the
blasphemy
of
my
life
guru
i
thank
you
for
coming
to
banish
my
long
delusion
i
was
sobbing
at
his
feet
promise
to
forsake
my
worldly
ambitions
i
will
retire
to
the
mountains
for
lonely
meditation
on
god
hoping
to
atone
for
my
evil
past
my
master
regarded
me
with
silent
compassion
feel
your
sincerity
he
said
finally
of
your
earlier
years
of
strict
obedience
and
because
of
your
present
repentance
i
will
grant
you
one
boon
your
other
powers
are
now
gone
but
whenever
food
and
clothing
are
needed
you
may
still
call
successfully
on
hazrat
to
supply
them
devote
yourself
wholeheartedly
to
divine
understanding
in
the
mountain
solitudes
my
guru
then
vanished
i
was
left
to
my
tears
and
reflections
farewell
world
i
go
to
seek
the
forgiveness
of
the
cosmic
beloved
a
moslem
yogi
from
the
arabic
faqir
poor
originally
applied
to
dervishes
under
a
vow
of
poverty
my
father
later
told
me
that
his
company
the
railway
had
been
one
of
the
firms
victimized
by
afzal
khan
i
do
not
recall
the
name
of
sri
yukteswar
friend
and
must
refer
to
him
simply
as
babu
mister
chapter
my
master
in
calcutta
appears
in
serampore
i
am
often
beset
by
atheistic
doubts
yet
a
torturing
surmise
sometimes
haunts
me
may
not
untapped
soul
possibilities
exist
is
man
not
missing
his
real
destiny
if
he
fails
to
explore
them
these
remarks
of
dijen
babu
my
roommate
at
the
panthi
boardinghouse
were
called
forth
by
my
invitation
that
he
meet
my
guru
sri
yukteswarji
will
initiate
you
into
kriya
yoga
i
replied
it
calms
the
dualistic
turmoil
by
a
divine
inner
certainty
that
evening
dijen
accompanied
me
to
the
hermitage
in
presence
my
friend
received
such
spiritual
peace
that
he
was
soon
a
constant
visitor
the
trivial
preoccupations
of
daily
life
are
not
enough
for
man
wisdom
too
is
a
native
hunger
in
sri
words
dijen
found
an
incentive
to
those
painful
then
effortlessly
locate
a
realer
self
within
his
bosom
than
the
humiliating
ego
of
a
temporary
birth
seldom
ample
enough
for
the
spirit
as
dijen
and
i
were
both
pursuing
the
course
at
serampore
college
we
got
into
the
habit
of
walking
together
to
the
ashram
as
soon
as
classes
were
over
we
would
often
see
sri
yukteswar
standing
on
his
balcony
welcoming
our
approach
with
a
smile
one
afternoon
kanai
a
young
hermitage
resident
met
dijen
and
me
at
the
door
with
disappointing
news
master
is
not
here
he
was
summoned
to
calcutta
by
an
urgent
note
the
following
day
i
received
a
post
card
from
my
guru
i
shall
leave
calcutta
wednesday
morning
he
had
written
you
and
dijen
meet
the
nine
train
at
serampore
station
about
on
wednesday
morning
a
telepathic
message
from
sri
yukteswar
flashed
insistently
to
my
mind
i
am
delayed
meet
the
nine
train
i
conveyed
the
latest
instructions
to
dijen
who
was
already
dressed
for
departure
you
and
your
intuition
my
friend
voice
was
edged
in
scorn
i
prefer
to
trust
master
written
word
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
seated
myself
with
quiet
finality
muttering
angrily
dijen
made
for
the
door
and
closed
it
noisily
behind
him
as
the
room
was
rather
dark
i
moved
nearer
to
the
window
overlooking
the
street
the
scant
sunlight
suddenly
increased
to
an
intense
brilliancy
in
which
the
window
completely
vanished
against
this
dazzling
background
appeared
the
clearly
materialized
figure
of
sri
yukteswar
bewildered
to
the
point
of
shock
i
rose
from
my
chair
and
knelt
before
him
with
my
customary
gesture
of
respectful
greeting
at
my
guru
feet
i
touched
his
shoes
these
were
a
pair
familiar
to
me
of
canvas
soled
with
rope
his
ocher
swami
cloth
brushed
against
me
i
distinctly
felt
not
only
the
texture
of
his
robe
but
also
the
gritty
surface
of
the
shoes
and
the
pressure
of
his
toes
within
them
too
much
astounded
to
utter
a
word
i
stood
up
and
gazed
at
him
questioningly
i
was
pleased
that
you
got
my
telepathic
message
master
voice
was
calm
entirely
normal
i
have
now
finished
my
business
in
calcutta
and
shall
arrive
in
serampore
by
the
ten
train
as
i
still
stared
mutely
sri
yukteswar
went
on
this
is
not
an
apparition
but
my
flesh
and
blood
form
i
have
been
divinely
commanded
to
give
you
this
experience
rare
to
achieve
on
earth
meet
me
at
the
station
you
and
dijen
will
see
me
coming
toward
you
dressed
as
i
am
now
i
shall
be
preceded
by
a
fellow
little
boy
carrying
a
silver
jug
my
guru
placed
both
hands
on
my
head
with
a
murmured
blessing
as
he
concluded
with
the
words
taba
asi
i
heard
a
peculiar
rumbling
sound
his
body
began
to
melt
gradually
within
the
piercing
light
first
his
feet
and
legs
vanished
then
his
torso
and
head
like
a
scroll
being
rolled
up
to
the
very
last
i
could
feel
his
fingers
resting
lightly
on
my
hair
the
effulgence
faded
nothing
remained
before
me
but
the
barred
window
and
a
pale
stream
of
sunlight
i
remained
in
a
of
confusion
questioning
whether
i
had
not
been
the
victim
of
a
hallucination
a
crestfallen
dijen
soon
entered
the
room
master
was
not
on
the
nine
train
nor
even
the
my
friend
made
his
announcement
with
a
slightly
apologetic
air
come
then
i
know
he
will
arrive
at
ten
i
took
hand
and
rushed
him
forcibly
along
with
me
heedless
of
his
protests
in
about
ten
minutes
we
entered
the
station
where
the
train
was
already
puffing
to
a
halt
the
whole
train
is
filled
with
the
light
of
master
aura
he
is
there
i
exclaimed
joyfully
you
dream
so
dijen
laughed
mockingly
let
us
wait
here
i
told
my
friend
details
of
the
way
in
which
our
guru
would
approach
us
as
i
finished
my
description
sri
yukteswar
came
into
view
wearing
the
same
clothes
i
had
seen
a
short
time
earlier
he
walked
slowly
in
the
wake
of
a
small
lad
bearing
a
silver
jug
for
a
moment
a
wave
of
cold
fear
passed
through
me
at
the
unprecedented
strangeness
of
my
experience
i
felt
the
materialistic
world
slipping
from
me
was
i
back
in
the
ancient
days
when
jesus
appeared
before
peter
on
the
sea
as
sri
yukteswar
a
modern
reached
the
spot
where
dijen
and
i
were
speechlessly
rooted
master
smiled
at
my
friend
and
remarked
i
sent
you
a
message
too
but
you
were
unable
to
grasp
it
dijen
was
silent
but
glared
at
me
suspiciously
after
we
had
escorted
our
guru
to
his
hermitage
my
friend
and
i
proceeded
toward
serampore
college
dijen
halted
in
the
street
indignation
streaming
from
his
every
pore
so
master
sent
me
a
message
yet
you
concealed
it
i
demand
an
explanation
can
i
help
it
if
your
mental
mirror
oscillates
with
such
restlessness
that
you
can
not
register
our
guru
instructions
i
retorted
the
anger
vanished
from
dijen
face
i
see
what
you
mean
he
said
ruefully
but
please
explain
how
you
could
know
about
the
child
with
the
jug
by
the
time
i
had
finished
the
story
of
master
phenomenal
appearance
at
the
boardinghouse
that
morning
my
friend
and
i
had
reached
serampore
college
the
account
i
have
just
heard
of
our
guru
powers
dijen
said
makes
me
feel
that
any
university
in
the
world
is
only
a
kindergarten
chapter
footnotes
the
bengali
literally
it
is
a
hopeful
paradox
then
i
come
the
characteristic
sound
of
dematerialization
of
bodily
atoms
chapter
we
do
not
visit
kashmir
father
i
want
to
invite
master
and
four
friends
to
accompany
me
to
the
himalayan
foothills
during
my
summer
vacation
may
i
have
six
train
passes
to
kashmir
and
enough
money
to
cover
our
travel
expenses
as
i
had
expected
father
laughed
heartily
this
is
the
third
time
you
have
given
me
the
same
story
did
you
make
a
similar
request
last
summer
and
the
year
before
that
at
the
last
moment
sri
yukteswarji
refuses
to
go
it
is
true
father
i
do
know
why
my
guru
will
not
give
me
his
definite
word
about
kashmir
but
if
i
tell
him
that
i
have
already
secured
the
passes
from
you
somehow
i
think
that
this
time
he
will
consent
to
make
the
journey
father
was
unconvinced
at
the
moment
but
the
following
day
after
some
gibes
he
handed
me
six
passes
and
a
roll
of
bills
i
hardly
think
your
theoretical
trip
needs
such
practical
props
he
remarked
but
here
they
are
that
afternoon
i
exhibited
my
booty
to
sri
yukteswar
though
he
smiled
at
my
enthusiasm
his
words
were
noncommittal
i
would
like
to
go
we
shall
see
he
made
no
comment
when
i
asked
his
little
hermitage
disciple
kanai
to
accompany
us
i
also
invited
three
other
friends
rajendra
nath
mitra
jotin
auddy
and
one
other
boy
our
date
of
departure
was
set
for
the
following
monday
on
saturday
and
sunday
i
stayed
in
calcutta
where
marriage
rites
for
a
cousin
were
being
celebrated
at
my
family
home
i
arrived
in
serampore
with
my
luggage
early
monday
morning
rajendra
met
me
at
the
hermitage
door
master
is
out
walking
he
has
refused
to
go
i
was
equally
grieved
and
obdurate
i
will
not
give
father
a
third
chance
to
ridicule
my
chimerical
plans
for
kashmir
come
the
rest
of
us
will
go
anyhow
rajendra
agreed
i
left
the
ashram
to
find
a
servant
kanai
i
knew
would
not
take
the
trip
without
master
and
someone
was
needed
to
look
after
the
luggage
i
bethought
myself
of
behari
previously
a
servant
in
my
family
home
who
was
now
employed
by
a
serampore
schoolmaster
as
i
walked
along
briskly
i
met
my
guru
in
front
of
the
christian
church
near
serampore
courthouse
where
are
you
going
sri
yukteswar
face
was
unsmiling
sir
i
hear
that
you
and
kanai
will
not
take
the
trip
we
have
been
planning
i
am
seeking
behari
you
will
recall
that
last
year
he
was
so
anxious
to
see
kashmir
that
he
even
offered
to
serve
without
pay
i
remember
nevertheless
i
do
think
behari
will
be
willing
to
go
i
was
exasperated
he
is
just
eagerly
waiting
for
this
opportunity
my
guru
silently
resumed
his
walk
i
soon
reached
the
house
behari
in
the
courtyard
greeted
me
with
a
friendly
warmth
that
abruptly
vanished
as
soon
as
i
mentioned
kashmir
with
a
murmured
word
of
apology
the
servant
left
me
and
entered
his
house
i
waited
half
an
hour
nervously
assuring
myself
that
behari
delay
was
being
caused
by
preparations
for
his
trip
finally
i
knocked
at
the
front
door
behari
left
by
the
back
stairs
about
thirty
minutes
ago
a
man
informed
me
a
slight
smile
hovered
about
his
lips
i
departed
sadly
wondering
whether
my
invitation
had
been
too
coercive
or
whether
master
unseen
influence
were
at
work
passing
the
christian
church
again
i
saw
my
guru
walking
slowly
toward
me
without
waiting
to
hear
my
report
he
exclaimed
so
behari
would
not
go
now
what
are
your
plans
i
felt
like
a
recalcitrant
child
who
is
determined
to
defy
his
masterful
father
sir
i
am
going
to
ask
my
uncle
to
lend
me
his
servant
lal
dhari
see
your
uncle
if
you
want
to
sri
yukteswar
replied
with
a
chuckle
but
i
hardly
think
you
will
enjoy
the
visit
apprehensive
but
rebellious
i
left
my
guru
and
entered
serampore
courthouse
my
paternal
uncle
sarada
ghosh
a
government
attorney
welcomed
me
affectionately
i
am
leaving
today
with
some
friends
for
kashmir
i
told
him
for
years
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
himalayan
trip
i
am
happy
for
you
mukunda
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
make
your
journey
more
comfortable
these
kind
words
gave
me
a
lift
of
encouragement
dear
uncle
i
said
could
you
possibly
spare
me
your
servant
lal
dhari
my
simple
request
had
the
effect
of
an
earthquake
uncle
jumped
so
violently
that
his
chair
overturned
the
papers
on
the
desk
flew
in
every
direction
and
his
pipe
a
long
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
great
clatter
you
selfish
young
man
he
shouted
quivering
with
wrath
what
a
preposterous
idea
who
will
look
after
me
if
you
take
my
servant
on
one
of
your
pleasure
jaunts
i
concealed
my
surprise
reflecting
that
my
amiable
uncle
sudden
change
of
front
was
only
one
more
enigma
in
a
day
fully
devoted
to
incomprehensibility
my
retreat
from
the
courthouse
office
was
more
alacritous
than
dignified
i
returned
to
the
hermitage
where
my
friends
were
expectantly
gathered
conviction
was
growing
on
me
that
some
sufficient
if
exceedingly
recondite
motive
was
behind
master
attitude
remorse
seized
me
that
i
had
been
trying
to
thwart
my
guru
will
mukunda
would
you
like
to
stay
awhile
longer
with
me
sri
yukteswar
inquired
rajendra
and
the
others
can
go
ahead
now
and
wait
for
you
at
calcutta
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
catch
the
last
evening
train
leaving
calcutta
for
kashmir
sir
i
do
care
to
go
without
you
i
said
mournfully
my
friends
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
my
remark
they
summoned
a
hackney
carriage
and
departed
with
all
the
luggage
kanai
and
i
sat
quietly
at
our
guru
feet
after
a
half
hour
of
complete
silence
master
rose
and
walked
toward
the
dining
patio
kanai
please
serve
mukunda
food
his
train
leaves
soon
getting
up
from
my
blanket
seat
i
staggered
suddenly
with
nausea
and
a
ghastly
churning
sensation
in
my
stomach
the
stabbing
pain
was
so
intense
that
i
felt
i
had
been
abruptly
hurled
into
some
violent
hell
groping
blindly
toward
my
guru
i
collapsed
before
him
attacked
by
all
symptoms
of
the
dread
asiatic
cholera
sri
yukteswar
and
kanai
carried
me
to
the
sitting
room
racked
with
agony
i
cried
master
i
surrender
my
life
to
you
for
i
believed
it
was
indeed
fast
ebbing
from
the
shores
of
my
body
sri
yukteswar
put
my
head
on
his
lap
stroking
my
forehead
with
angelic
tenderness
you
see
now
what
would
have
happened
if
you
were
at
the
station
with
your
friends
he
said
i
had
to
look
after
you
in
this
strange
way
because
you
chose
to
doubt
my
judgment
about
taking
the
trip
at
this
particular
time
i
understood
at
last
inasmuch
as
great
masters
seldom
see
fit
to
display
their
powers
openly
a
casual
observer
of
the
day
events
would
have
imagined
that
their
sequence
was
quite
natural
my
intervention
had
been
too
subtle
to
be
suspected
he
had
worked
his
will
through
behari
and
my
uncle
sarada
and
rajendra
and
the
others
in
such
an
inconspicuous
manner
that
probably
everyone
but
myself
thought
the
situations
had
been
logically
normal
as
sri
yukteswar
never
failed
to
observe
his
social
obligations
he
instructed
kanai
to
go
for
a
specialist
and
to
notify
my
uncle
master
i
protested
only
you
can
heal
me
i
am
too
far
gone
for
any
doctor
child
you
are
protected
by
the
divine
mercy
do
worry
about
the
doctor
he
will
not
find
you
in
this
state
you
are
already
healed
with
my
guru
words
the
excruciating
suffering
left
me
i
sat
up
feebly
a
doctor
soon
arrived
and
examined
me
carefully
you
appear
to
have
passed
through
the
worst
he
said
i
will
take
some
specimens
with
me
for
laboratory
tests
the
following
morning
the
physician
arrived
hurriedly
i
was
sitting
up
in
good
spirits
well
well
here
you
are
smiling
and
chatting
as
though
you
had
had
no
close
call
with
death
he
patted
my
hand
gently
i
hardly
expected
to
find
you
alive
after
i
had
discovered
from
the
specimens
that
your
disease
was
asiatic
cholera
you
are
fortunate
young
man
to
have
a
guru
with
divine
healing
powers
i
am
convinced
of
it
i
agreed
wholeheartedly
as
the
doctor
was
preparing
to
leave
rajendra
and
auddy
appeared
at
the
door
the
resentment
in
their
faces
changed
into
sympathy
as
they
glanced
at
the
physician
and
then
at
my
somewhat
wan
countenance
we
were
angry
when
you
did
turn
up
as
agreed
at
the
calcutta
train
you
have
been
sick
yes
i
could
not
help
laughing
as
my
friends
placed
the
luggage
in
the
same
corner
it
had
occupied
yesterday
i
quoted
there
was
a
ship
that
went
to
spain
when
it
arrived
it
came
back
again
master
entered
the
room
i
permitted
myself
a
convalescent
liberty
and
captured
his
hand
lovingly
guruji
i
said
from
my
twelfth
year
on
i
have
made
many
unsuccessful
attempts
to
reach
the
himalayas
i
am
finally
convinced
that
without
your
blessings
the
goddess
parvati
will
not
receive
me
although
master
failed
to
make
any
explanation
his
reluctance
to
visit
kashmir
during
those
two
summers
may
have
been
a
foreknowledge
that
the
time
was
not
ripe
for
his
illness
there
see
chapter
literally
of
the
mountains
parvati
mythologically
represented
as
a
daughter
of
himavat
or
the
sacred
mountains
is
a
name
given
to
the
shakti
or
consort
of
shiva
chapter
we
visit
kashmir
you
are
strong
enough
now
to
travel
i
will
accompany
you
to
kashmir
sri
yukteswar
informed
me
two
days
after
my
miraculous
recovery
from
asiatic
cholera
that
evening
our
party
of
six
entrained
for
the
north
our
first
leisurely
stop
was
at
simla
a
queenly
city
resting
on
the
throne
of
himalayan
hills
we
strolled
over
the
steep
streets
admiring
the
magnificent
views
english
strawberries
for
sale
cried
an
old
woman
squatting
in
a
picturesque
open
market
place
master
was
curious
about
the
strange
little
red
fruits
he
bought
a
basketful
and
offered
it
to
kanai
and
myself
who
were
i
tasted
one
berry
but
spat
it
hastily
on
the
ground
sir
what
a
sour
fruit
i
could
never
like
strawberries
my
guru
laughed
oh
you
will
like
america
at
a
dinner
there
your
hostess
will
serve
them
with
sugar
and
cream
after
she
has
mashed
the
berries
with
a
fork
you
will
taste
them
and
say
delicious
strawberries
then
you
will
remember
this
day
in
simla
sri
yukteswar
forecast
vanished
from
my
mind
but
reappeared
there
many
years
later
shortly
after
my
arrival
in
america
i
was
a
dinner
guest
at
the
home
of
alice
hasey
sister
yogmata
in
west
somerville
massachusetts
when
a
dessert
of
strawberries
was
put
on
the
table
my
hostess
picked
up
her
fork
and
mashed
my
berries
adding
cream
and
sugar
the
fruit
is
rather
tart
i
think
you
will
like
it
fixed
this
way
she
remarked
i
took
a
mouthful
what
delicious
strawberries
i
exclaimed
at
once
my
guru
prediction
in
simla
emerged
from
the
fathomless
cave
of
memory
it
was
staggering
to
realize
that
long
ago
sri
yukteswar
mind
had
sensitively
detected
the
program
of
karmic
events
wandering
in
the
ether
of
futurity
our
party
soon
left
simla
and
entrained
for
rawalpindi
there
we
hired
a
large
landau
drawn
by
two
horses
in
which
we
started
a
trip
to
srinagar
capital
city
of
kashmir
the
second
day
of
our
northbound
journey
brought
into
view
the
true
himalayan
vastness
as
the
iron
wheels
of
our
carriage
creaked
along
the
hot
stony
roads
we
were
enraptured
with
changing
vistas
of
mountainous
grandeur
sir
auddy
said
to
master
i
am
greatly
enjoying
these
glorious
scenes
in
your
holy
company
i
felt
a
throb
of
pleasure
at
auddy
appreciation
for
i
was
acting
as
host
on
this
trip
sri
yukteswar
caught
my
thought
he
turned
to
me
and
whispered
do
flatter
yourself
auddy
is
not
nearly
as
entranced
with
the
scenery
as
he
is
with
the
prospect
of
leaving
us
long
enough
to
have
a
cigaret
i
was
shocked
sir
i
said
in
an
undertone
please
do
not
break
our
harmony
by
these
unpleasant
words
i
can
hardly
believe
that
auddy
is
hankering
for
a
smoke
i
looked
apprehensively
at
my
usually
irrepressible
guru
very
well
i
wo
say
anything
to
auddy
master
chuckled
but
you
will
soon
see
when
the
landau
halts
that
auddy
is
quick
to
seize
his
opportunity
the
carriage
arrived
at
a
small
caravanserai
as
our
horses
were
led
to
be
watered
auddy
inquired
sir
do
you
mind
if
i
ride
awhile
with
the
driver
i
would
like
to
get
a
little
outside
air
sri
yukteswar
gave
permission
but
remarked
to
me
he
wants
fresh
smoke
and
not
fresh
air
the
landau
resumed
its
noisy
progress
over
the
dusty
roads
eyes
were
twinkling
he
instructed
me
crane
up
your
neck
through
the
carriage
door
and
see
what
auddy
is
doing
with
the
air
i
obeyed
and
was
astounded
to
observe
auddy
in
the
act
of
exhaling
rings
of
cigaret
smoke
my
glance
toward
sri
yukteswar
was
apologetic
you
are
right
as
always
sir
auddy
is
enjoying
a
puff
along
with
a
panorama
i
surmised
that
my
friend
had
received
a
gift
from
the
cab
driver
i
knew
auddy
had
not
carried
any
cigarets
from
calcutta
we
continued
on
the
labyrinthine
way
adorned
by
views
of
rivers
valleys
precipitous
crags
and
multitudinous
mountain
tiers
every
night
we
stopped
at
rustic
inns
and
prepared
our
own
food
sri
yukteswar
took
special
care
of
my
diet
insisting
that
i
have
lime
juice
at
all
meals
i
was
still
weak
but
daily
improving
though
the
rattling
carriage
was
strictly
designed
for
discomfort
joyous
anticipations
filled
our
hearts
as
we
neared
central
kashmir
paradise
land
of
lotus
lakes
floating
gardens
gaily
canopied
houseboats
the
jhelum
river
and
pastures
all
ringed
round
by
the
himalayan
majesty
our
approach
to
srinagar
was
through
an
avenue
of
tall
welcoming
trees
we
engaged
rooms
at
a
inn
overlooking
the
noble
hills
no
running
water
was
available
we
drew
our
supply
from
a
well
the
summer
weather
was
ideal
with
warm
days
and
slightly
cold
nights
we
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
ancient
srinagar
temple
of
swami
shankara
as
i
gazed
upon
the
hermitage
standing
bold
against
the
sky
i
fell
into
an
ecstatic
trance
a
vision
appeared
of
a
hilltop
mansion
in
a
distant
land
the
lofty
shankara
ashram
before
me
was
transformed
into
the
structure
where
years
later
i
established
the
fellowship
headquarters
in
america
when
i
first
visited
los
angeles
and
saw
the
large
building
on
the
crest
of
mount
washington
i
recognized
it
at
once
from
my
visions
in
kashmir
and
elsewhere
a
few
days
at
srinagar
then
on
to
gulmarg
mountain
paths
of
flowers
elevated
by
six
thousand
feet
there
i
had
my
first
ride
on
a
large
horse
rajendra
mounted
a
small
trotter
whose
heart
was
fired
with
ambition
for
speed
we
ventured
onto
the
very
steep
khilanmarg
the
path
led
through
a
dense
forest
abounding
in
where
the
trails
were
often
precarious
but
rajendra
little
animal
never
permitted
my
oversized
steed
a
moment
rest
even
at
the
most
perilous
turns
on
on
untiringly
came
rajendra
horse
oblivious
to
all
but
the
joy
of
competition
our
strenuous
race
was
rewarded
by
a
view
for
the
first
time
in
this
life
i
gazed
in
all
directions
at
sublime
himalayas
lying
tier
upon
tier
like
silhouettes
of
huge
polar
bears
my
eyes
feasted
exultingly
on
endless
reaches
of
icy
mountains
against
sunny
blue
skies
i
rolled
merrily
with
my
young
companions
all
wearing
overcoats
on
the
sparkling
white
slopes
on
our
downward
trip
we
saw
afar
a
vast
carpet
of
yellow
flowers
wholly
transfiguring
the
bleak
hills
our
next
excursions
were
to
the
famous
royal
pleasure
gardens
of
the
emperor
jehangir
at
shalimar
and
nishat
bagh
the
ancient
palace
at
nishat
bagh
is
built
directly
over
a
natural
waterfall
rushing
down
from
the
mountains
the
torrent
has
been
regulated
through
ingenious
contrivances
to
flow
over
colorful
terraces
and
to
gush
into
fountains
amidst
the
dazzling
the
stream
also
enters
several
of
the
palace
rooms
ultimately
dropping
fairy
like
into
the
lake
below
the
immense
gardens
are
riotous
with
color
roses
of
a
dozen
hues
snapdragons
lavender
pansies
poppies
an
emerald
enclosing
outline
is
given
by
symmetrical
rows
of
chinars
cypresses
cherry
trees
beyond
them
tower
the
white
austerities
of
the
himalayas
kashmir
grapes
are
considered
a
rare
delicacy
in
calcutta
rajendra
who
had
been
promising
himself
a
veritable
feast
on
reaching
kashmir
was
disappointed
to
find
there
no
large
vineyards
now
and
then
i
chaffed
him
jocosely
over
his
baseless
anticipation
oh
i
have
become
so
much
gorged
with
grapes
i
ca
walk
i
would
say
the
invisible
grapes
are
brewing
within
me
later
i
heard
that
sweet
grapes
grow
abundantly
in
kabul
west
of
kashmir
we
consoled
ourselves
with
ice
cream
made
of
rabri
a
heavily
condensed
milk
and
flavored
with
whole
pistachio
nuts
we
took
several
trips
in
the
shikaras
or
houseboats
shaded
by
canopies
coursing
along
the
intricate
channels
of
dal
lake
a
network
of
canals
like
a
watery
spider
web
here
the
numerous
floating
gardens
crudely
improvised
with
logs
and
earth
strike
one
with
amazement
so
incongruous
is
the
first
sight
of
vegetables
and
melons
growing
in
the
midst
of
vast
waters
occasionally
one
sees
a
peasant
disdaining
to
be
rooted
to
the
soil
towing
his
square
plot
of
land
to
a
new
location
in
the
lake
in
this
storied
vale
one
finds
an
epitome
of
all
the
beauties
the
lady
of
kashmir
is
and
in
later
years
after
i
had
toured
many
distant
lands
i
understood
why
kashmir
is
often
called
the
world
most
scenic
spot
it
possesses
some
of
the
charms
of
the
swiss
alps
and
of
loch
lomond
in
scotland
and
of
the
exquisite
english
lakes
an
american
traveler
in
kashmir
finds
much
to
remind
him
of
the
rugged
grandeur
of
alaska
and
of
pikes
peak
near
denver
as
entries
in
a
scenic
beauty
contest
i
offer
for
first
prize
either
the
gorgeous
view
of
xochimilco
in
mexico
where
mountains
skies
and
poplars
reflect
themselves
in
myriad
lanes
of
water
amidst
the
playful
fish
or
the
lakes
of
kashmir
guarded
like
beautiful
maidens
by
the
stern
surveillance
of
the
himalayas
these
two
places
stand
out
in
my
memory
as
the
loveliest
spots
on
earth
yet
i
was
awed
also
when
i
first
beheld
the
wonders
of
yellowstone
national
park
and
of
the
grand
canyon
of
the
colorado
and
of
alaska
yellowstone
park
is
perhaps
the
only
region
where
one
can
see
innumerable
geysers
shooting
high
into
the
air
performing
year
after
year
with
clockwork
regularity
its
opal
and
sapphire
pools
and
hot
sulphurous
springs
its
bears
and
wild
creatures
remind
one
that
here
nature
left
a
specimen
of
her
earliest
creation
motoring
along
the
roads
of
wyoming
to
the
devil
paint
pot
of
hot
bubbling
mud
with
gurgling
springs
vaporous
fountains
and
spouting
geysers
in
all
directions
i
was
disposed
to
say
that
yellowstone
deserves
a
special
prize
for
uniqueness
the
ancient
majestic
redwoods
of
yosemite
stretching
their
huge
columns
far
into
the
unfathomable
sky
are
green
natural
cathedrals
designed
with
skill
divine
though
there
are
wonderful
falls
in
the
orient
none
match
the
torrential
beauty
of
niagara
near
the
canadian
border
the
mammoth
caves
of
kentucky
and
the
carlsbad
caverns
in
new
mexico
with
colorful
iciclelike
formations
are
stunning
fairylands
their
long
needles
of
stalactite
spires
hanging
from
cave
ceilings
and
mirrored
in
underground
waters
present
a
glimpse
of
other
worlds
as
fancied
by
man
most
of
the
hindus
of
kashmir
for
their
beauty
are
as
white
as
europeans
and
have
similar
features
and
bone
structure
many
have
blue
eyes
and
blonde
hair
dressed
in
western
clothes
they
look
like
americans
the
cold
himalayas
protect
the
kashmiris
from
the
sultry
sun
and
preserve
their
light
complexions
as
one
travels
to
the
southern
and
tropical
latitudes
of
india
he
finds
progressively
that
the
people
become
darker
and
darker
after
spending
happy
weeks
in
kashmir
i
was
forced
to
return
to
bengal
for
the
fall
term
of
serampore
college
sri
yukteswar
remained
in
srinagar
with
kanai
and
auddy
before
i
departed
master
hinted
that
his
body
would
be
subject
to
suffering
in
kashmir
sir
you
look
a
picture
of
health
i
protested
there
is
a
chance
that
i
may
even
leave
this
earth
guruji
i
fell
at
his
feet
with
an
imploring
gesture
please
promise
that
you
wo
leave
your
body
now
i
am
utterly
unprepared
to
carry
on
without
you
sri
yukteswar
was
silent
but
smiled
at
me
so
compassionately
that
i
felt
reassured
reluctantly
i
left
him
master
dangerously
this
telegram
from
auddy
reached
me
shortly
after
my
return
to
serampore
sir
i
wired
my
guru
frantically
i
asked
for
your
promise
not
to
leave
me
please
keep
your
body
otherwise
i
also
shall
die
be
it
as
you
wish
this
was
sri
yukteswar
reply
from
kashmir
a
letter
from
auddy
arrived
in
a
few
days
informing
me
that
master
had
recovered
on
his
return
to
serampore
during
the
next
fortnight
i
was
grieved
to
find
my
guru
body
reduced
to
half
its
usual
weight
fortunately
for
his
disciples
sri
yukteswar
burned
many
of
their
sins
in
the
fire
of
his
severe
fever
in
kashmir
the
metaphysical
method
of
physical
transfer
of
disease
is
known
to
highly
advanced
yogis
a
strong
man
can
assist
a
weaker
one
by
helping
to
carry
his
heavy
load
a
spiritual
superman
is
able
to
minimize
his
physical
or
mental
burdens
by
sharing
the
karma
of
their
past
actions
just
as
a
rich
man
loses
some
money
when
he
pays
off
a
large
debt
for
his
prodigal
son
who
is
thus
saved
from
dire
consequences
of
his
own
folly
so
a
master
willingly
sacrifices
a
portion
of
his
bodily
wealth
to
lighten
the
misery
of
disciples
by
a
secret
method
the
yogi
unites
his
mind
and
astral
vehicle
with
those
of
a
suffering
individual
the
disease
is
conveyed
wholly
or
in
part
to
the
saint
body
having
harvested
god
on
the
physical
field
a
master
no
longer
cares
what
happens
to
that
material
form
though
he
may
allow
it
to
register
a
certain
disease
in
order
to
relieve
others
his
mind
is
never
affected
he
considers
himself
fortunate
in
being
able
to
render
such
aid
the
devotee
who
has
achieved
final
salvation
in
the
lord
finds
that
his
body
has
completely
fulfilled
its
purpose
he
can
then
use
it
in
any
way
he
deems
fit
his
work
in
the
world
is
to
alleviate
the
sorrows
of
mankind
whether
through
spiritual
means
or
by
intellectual
counsel
or
through
will
power
or
by
the
physical
transfer
of
disease
escaping
to
the
superconsciousness
whenever
he
so
desires
a
master
can
remain
oblivious
of
physical
suffering
sometimes
he
chooses
to
bear
bodily
pain
stoically
as
an
example
to
disciples
by
putting
on
the
ailments
of
others
a
yogi
can
satisfy
for
them
the
karmic
law
of
cause
and
effect
this
law
is
mechanically
or
mathematically
operative
its
workings
can
be
scientifically
manipulated
by
men
of
divine
wisdom
the
spiritual
law
does
not
require
a
master
to
become
ill
whenever
he
heals
another
person
healings
ordinarily
take
place
through
the
saint
knowledge
of
various
methods
of
instantaneous
cure
in
which
no
hurt
to
the
spiritual
healer
is
involved
on
rare
occasions
however
a
master
who
wishes
to
greatly
quicken
his
evolution
may
then
voluntarily
work
out
on
his
own
body
a
large
measure
of
their
undesirable
karma
jesus
signified
himself
as
a
ransom
for
the
sins
of
many
with
his
divine
powers
his
body
could
never
have
been
subjected
to
death
by
crucifixion
if
he
had
not
willingly
cooperated
with
the
subtle
cosmic
law
of
cause
and
effect
he
thus
took
on
himself
the
consequences
of
others
karma
especially
that
of
his
disciples
in
this
manner
they
were
highly
purified
and
made
fit
to
receive
the
omnipresent
consciousness
which
later
descended
on
them
only
a
master
can
transfer
his
life
force
or
convey
into
his
own
body
the
diseases
of
others
an
ordinary
man
can
not
employ
this
yogic
method
of
cure
nor
is
it
desirable
that
he
should
do
so
for
an
unsound
physical
instrument
is
a
hindrance
to
god
meditation
the
hindu
scriptures
teach
that
the
first
duty
of
man
is
to
keep
his
body
in
good
condition
otherwise
his
mind
is
unable
to
remain
fixed
in
devotional
concentration
a
very
strong
mind
however
can
transcend
all
physical
difficulties
and
attain
to
many
saints
have
ignored
illness
and
succeeded
in
their
divine
quest
francis
of
assisi
severely
afflicted
with
ailments
healed
others
and
even
raised
the
dead
i
knew
an
indian
saint
half
of
whose
body
was
once
festering
with
sores
his
diabetic
condition
was
so
acute
that
under
ordinary
conditions
he
could
not
sit
still
at
one
time
for
more
than
fifteen
minutes
but
his
spiritual
aspiration
was
undeterrable
lord
he
prayed
wilt
thou
come
into
my
broken
temple
with
ceaseless
command
of
will
the
saint
gradually
became
able
to
sit
daily
in
the
lotus
posture
for
eighteen
continuous
hours
engrossed
in
the
ecstatic
trance
and
he
told
me
at
the
end
of
three
years
i
found
the
infinite
light
blazing
within
my
shattered
form
rejoicing
in
the
joyful
splendour
i
forgot
the
body
later
i
saw
that
it
had
become
whole
through
the
divine
mercy
a
historical
healing
incident
concerns
king
baber
founder
of
the
mogul
empire
in
india
his
son
prince
humayun
was
mortally
ill
the
father
prayed
with
anguished
determination
that
he
receive
the
sickness
and
that
his
son
be
spared
after
all
physicians
had
given
up
hope
humayun
recovered
baber
immediately
fell
sick
and
died
of
the
same
disease
which
had
stricken
his
son
humayun
succeeded
baber
as
emperor
of
hindustan
many
people
imagine
that
every
spiritual
master
has
or
should
have
the
health
and
strength
of
a
sandow
the
assumption
is
unfounded
a
sickly
body
does
not
indicate
that
a
guru
is
not
in
touch
with
divine
powers
any
more
than
lifelong
health
necessarily
indicates
an
inner
illumination
the
condition
of
the
physical
body
in
other
words
can
not
rightfully
be
made
a
test
of
a
master
his
distinguishing
qualifications
must
be
sought
in
his
own
domain
the
spiritual
numerous
bewildered
seekers
in
the
west
erroneously
think
that
an
eloquent
speaker
or
writer
on
metaphysics
must
be
a
master
the
rishis
however
have
pointed
out
that
the
acid
test
of
a
master
is
a
man
ability
to
enter
at
will
the
breathless
state
and
to
maintain
the
unbroken
samadhi
of
nirbikalpa
only
by
these
achievements
can
a
human
being
prove
that
he
has
mastered
maya
or
the
dualistic
cosmic
delusion
he
alone
can
say
from
the
depths
of
realization
ekam
sat
only
one
exists
the
vedas
declare
that
the
ignorant
man
who
rests
content
with
making
the
slightest
distinction
between
the
individual
soul
and
the
supreme
self
is
exposed
to
danger
shankara
the
great
monist
has
written
where
there
is
duality
by
virtue
of
ignorance
one
sees
all
things
as
distinct
from
the
self
when
everything
is
seen
as
the
self
then
there
is
not
even
an
atom
other
than
the
self
as
soon
as
the
knowledge
of
the
reality
has
sprung
up
there
can
be
no
fruits
of
past
actions
to
be
experienced
owing
to
the
unreality
of
the
body
in
the
same
way
as
there
can
be
no
dream
after
waking
only
great
gurus
are
able
to
assume
the
karma
of
disciples
sri
yukteswar
would
not
have
suffered
in
kashmir
unless
he
had
received
permission
from
the
spirit
within
him
to
help
his
disciples
in
that
strange
way
few
saints
were
ever
more
sensitively
equipped
with
wisdom
to
carry
out
divine
commands
than
my
master
when
i
ventured
a
few
words
of
sympathy
over
his
emaciated
figure
my
guru
said
gaily
it
has
its
good
points
i
am
able
now
to
get
into
some
small
ganjis
undershirts
that
i
have
worn
in
years
listening
to
master
jovial
laugh
i
remembered
the
words
of
francis
de
sales
a
saint
that
is
sad
is
a
sad
saint
it
is
a
mark
of
disrespect
in
india
to
smoke
in
the
presence
of
one
elders
and
superiors
the
oriental
plane
many
christian
saints
including
therese
neumann
see
chapter
are
familiar
with
the
metaphysical
transfer
of
disease
christ
said
just
before
he
was
led
away
to
be
crucified
thinkest
thou
that
i
can
not
now
pray
to
my
father
and
he
shall
presently
give
me
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels
but
how
then
shall
the
scriptures
be
fulfilled
that
thus
it
must
be

the
heart
of
a
stone
image
as
a
loyal

wife
i
do
not
wish
to
complain
of
my
husband
but
i
yearn
to
see
him
turn
from
his
materialistic
views
he
delights
in
ridiculing
the
pictures
of
saints
in
my
meditation
room
dear
brother
i
have
deep
faith
that
you
can
help

you
my
eldest
sister
roma
gazed
beseechingly
at
me
i
was
paying
a
short
visit
at
her
calcutta
home
on
girish
vidyaratna
lane
her
plea
touched
me
for
she
had
exercised
a
profound
spiritual
influence
over
my
early
life
and
had
lovingly
tried
to
fill
the
void
left
in
the
family
circle
by
mother
death
beloved
sister
of
course
i
will
do
anything
i
can
i
smiled
eager
to
lift
the
gloom
plainly
visible
on
her
face
in
contrast
to
her
usual
calm
and
cheerful
expression
roma
and
i
sat
awhile
in
silent
prayer
for
guidance
a
year
earlier
my
sister
had
asked
me
to
initiate
her
into
kriya
yoga
in
which
she
was
making
notable
progress
an
inspiration
seized
me
tomorrow
i
said
i
am
going
to
the
dakshineswar
temple
please
come
with
me
and
persuade
your
husband
to
accompany
us
i
feel
that
in
the
vibrations
of
that
holy
place
divine
mother
will
touch
his
heart
but
do
disclose
our
object
in
wanting
him
to
go
sister
agreed
hopefully
very
early
the
next
morning
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
roma
and
her
husband
were
in
readiness
for
the
trip
as
our
hackney
carriage
rattled
along
upper
circular
road
toward
dakshineswar
my
satish
chandra
bose
amused
himself
by
deriding
spiritual
gurus
of
the
past
present
and
future
i
noticed
that
roma
was
quietly
weeping

as

up
i
whispered
do
give
your

the
satisfaction
of
believing
that
we
take
his
mockery
seriously
mukunda
how
can
you
admire
worthless
humbugs
satish
was
saying
a
sadhu
very
appearance
is
repulsive
he
is
either
as
thin
as
a
skeleton
or
as
unholily
fat
as
an
elephant
i
shouted
with
laughter
my
reaction
was
annoying
to
satish
he
retired
into
sullen
silence
as
our
cab
entered
the
dakshineswar
grounds
he
grinned
sarcastically
this
excursion
i
suppose
is
a
scheme
to
reform
me
as
i
turned
away
without
reply
he
caught
my
arm
young
monk
he
said
do
forget
to
make
proper
arrangements
with
the
temple
authorities
to
provide
for
our
noon
meal
i
am
going
to
meditate
now
do
not
worry
about
your
lunch
i
replied
sharply
divine
mother
will
look
after
it
i
do
trust
divine
mother
to
do
a
single
thing
for
me
but
i
do
hold
you
responsible
for
my
food
satish
tones
were
threatening
i
proceeded
alone
to
the
colonnaded
hall
which
fronts
the
large
temple
of
kali
or
mother
nature
selecting
a
shady
spot
near
one
of
the
pillars
i
arranged
my
body
in
the
lotus
posture
although
it
was
only
about
seven
the
morning
sun
would
soon
be
oppressive
the
world
receded
as
i
became
devotionally
entranced
my
mind
was
concentrated
on
goddess
kali
whose
image
at
dakshineswar
had
been
the
special
object
of
adoration
by
the
great
master
sri
ramakrishna
paramhansa
in
answer
to
his
anguished
demands
the
stone
image
of
this
very
temple
had
often
taken
a
living
form
and
conversed
with
him
silent
mother
with
stony
heart
i
prayed
thou
becamest
filled
with
life
at
the
request
of
thy
beloved
devotee
ramakrishna
why
dost
thou
not
also
heed
the
wails
of
this
yearning
son
of
thine
my
aspiring
zeal
increased
boundlessly
accompanied
by
a
divine
peace
yet
when
five
hours
had
passed
and
the
goddess
whom
i
was
inwardly
visualizing
had
made
no
response
i
felt
slightly
disheartened
sometimes
it
is
a
test
by
god
to
delay
the
fulfillment
of
prayers
but
he
eventually
appears
to
the
persistent
devotee
in
whatever
form
he
holds
dear
a
devout
christian
sees
jesus
a
hindu
beholds
krishna
or
the
goddess
kali
or
an
expanding
light
if
his
worship
takes
an
impersonal
turn
reluctantly
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
that
the
temple
doors
were
being
locked
by
a
priest
in
conformance
with
a
custom
i
rose
from
my
secluded
seat
under
the
open
roofed
hall
and
stepped
into
the
courtyard
its
stone
floor
was
scorching
under
the
midday
sun
my
bare
feet
were
painfully
burned
divine
mother
i
silently
remonstrated
thou
didst
not
come
to
me
in
vision
and
now
thou
art
hidden
in
the
temple
behind
closed
doors
i
wanted
to
offer
a
special
prayer
to
thee
today
on
behalf
of
my
my
inward
petition
was
instantly
acknowledged
first
a
delightful
cold
wave
descended
over
my
back
and
under
my
feet
banishing
all
discomfort
then
to
my
amazement
the
temple
became
greatly
magnified
its
large
door
slowly
opened
revealing
the
stone
figure
of
goddess
kali
gradually
it
changed
into
a
living
form
smilingly
nodding
in
greeting
thrilling
me
with
joy
indescribable
as
if
by
a
mystic
syringe
the
breath
was
withdrawn
from
my
lungs
my
body
became
very
still
though
not
inert
an
ecstatic
enlargement
of
consciousness
followed
i
could
see
clearly
for
several
miles
over
the
ganges
river
to
my
left
and
beyond
the
temple
into
the
entire
dakshineswar
precincts
the
walls
of
all
buildings
glimmered
transparently
through
them
i
observed
people
walking
to
and
fro
over
distant
acres
though
i
was
breathless
and
my
body
in
a
strangely
quiet
state
yet
i
was
able
to
move
my
hands
and
feet
freely
for
several
minutes
i
experimented
in
closing
and
opening
my
eyes
in
either
state
i
saw
distinctly
the
whole
dakshineswar
panorama
spiritual
sight
penetrates
into
all
matter
the
divine
eye
is
center
everywhere
circumference
nowhere
i
realized
anew
standing
there
in
the
sunny
courtyard
that
when
man
ceases
to
be
a
prodigal
child
of
god
engrossed
in
a
physical
world
indeed
dream
baseless
as
a
bubble
he
reinherits
his
eternal
realms
if
escapism
be
a
need
of
man
cramped
in
his
narrow
personality
can
any
escape
compare
with
the
majesty
of
omnipresence
in
my
sacred
experience
at
dakshineswar
the
only
objects
were
the
temple
and
the
form
of
the
goddess
everything
else
appeared
in
its
normal
dimensions
although
each
was
enclosed
in
a
halo
of
mellow
blue
and
pastel
rainbow
hues
my
body
seemed
to
be
of
ethereal
substance
ready
to
levitate
fully
conscious
of
my
material
surroundings
i
was
looking
about
me
and
taking
a
few
steps
without
disturbing
the
continuity
of
the
blissful
vision
behind
the
temple
walls
i
suddenly
glimpsed
my
as
he
sat
under
the
thorny
branches
of
a
sacred
bel
tree
i
could
effortlessly
discern
the
course
of
his
thoughts
somewhat
uplifted
under
the
holy
influence
of
dakshineswar
his
mind
yet
held
unkind
reflections
about
me
i
turned
directly
to
the
gracious
form
of
the
goddess
divine
mother
i
prayed
wilt
thou
not
spiritually
change
my
sister
husband
the
beautiful
figure
hitherto
silent
spoke
at
last
thy
wish
is
granted
i
looked
happily
at
satish
as
though
instinctively
aware
that
some
spiritual
power
was
at
work
he
rose
resentfully
from
his
seat
on
the
ground
i
saw
him
running
behind
the
temple
he
approached
me
shaking
his
fist
the
vision
disappeared
no
longer
could
i
see
the
glorious
goddess
the
towering
temple
was
reduced
to
its
ordinary
size
minus
its
transparency
again
my
body
sweltered
under
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
i
jumped
to
the
shelter
of
the
pillared
hall
where
satish
pursued
me
angrily
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
one
the
divine
vision
had
lasted
an
hour
you
little
fool
my
blurted
out
you
have
been
sitting
there
and
for
six
hours
i
have
gone
back
and
forth
watching
you
where
is
my
food
now
the
temple
is
closed
you
failed
to
notify
the
authorities
we
are
left
without
lunch
the
exaltation
i
had
felt
at
the
goddess
presence
was
still
vibrant
within
my
heart
i
was
emboldened
to
exclaim
divine
mother
will
feed
us
satish
was
beside
himself
with
rage
once
and
for
all
he
shouted
i
would
like
to
see
your
divine
mother
giving
us
food
here
without
prior
arrangements
his
words
were
hardly
uttered
when
a
temple
priest
crossed
the
courtyard
and
joined
us
son
he
addressed
me
i
have
been
observing
your
face
serenely
glowing
during
hours
of
meditation
i
saw
the
arrival
of
your
party
this
morning
and
felt
a
desire
to
put
aside
ample
food
for
your
lunch
it
is
against
the
temple
rules
to
feed
those
who
do
not
make
a
request
beforehand
but
i
have
made
an
exception
for
you
i
thanked
him
and
gazed
straight
into
satish
eyes
he
flushed
with
emotion
lowering
his
gaze
in
silent
repentance
when
we
were
served
a
lavish
meal
including
mangoes
i
noticed
that
my
appetite
was
meager
he
was
bewildered
diving
deep
into
the
ocean
of
thought
on
the
return
journey
to
calcutta
satish
with
softened
expression
occasionally
glanced
at
me
pleadingly
but
he
did
not
speak
a
single
word
after
the
moment
the
priest
had
appeared
to
invite
us
to
lunch
as
though
in
direct
answer
to
satish
challenge
the
following
afternoon
i
visited
my
sister
at
her
home
she
greeted
me
affectionately
dear
brother
she
cried
what
a
miracle
last
evening
my
husband
wept
openly
before
me
devi
he
said
am
happy
beyond
expression
that
this
reforming
scheme
of
your
brother
has
wrought
a
transformation
i
am
going
to
undo
every
wrong
i
have
done
you
from
tonight
we
will
use
our
large
bedroom
only
as
a
place
of
worship
your
small
meditation
room
shall
be
changed
into
our
sleeping
quarters
i
am
sincerely
sorry
that
i
have
ridiculed
your
brother
for
the
shameful
way
i
have
been
acting
i
will
punish
myself
by
not
talking
to
mukunda
until
i
have
progressed
in
the
spiritual
path
deeply
i
will
seek
the
divine
mother
from
now
on
someday
i
must
surely
find
her
years
later
i
visited
my
in
delhi
i
was
overjoyed
to
perceive
that
he
had
developed
highly
in
and
had
been
blessed
by
the
vision
of
divine
mother
during
my
stay
with
him
i
noticed
that
satish
secretly
spent
the
greater
part
of
every
night
in
divine
meditation
though
he
was
suffering
from
a
serious
ailment
and
was
engaged
during
the
day
at
his
office
the
thought
came
to
me
that
my
life
span
would
not
be
a
long
one
roma
must
have
read
my
mind
dear
brother
she
said
i
am
well
and
my
husband
is
sick
nevertheless
i
want
you
to
know
that
as
a
devoted
hindu
wife
i
am
going
to
be
the
first
one
to
die
it
wo
be
long
now
before
i
pass
on
taken
aback
at
her
ominous
words
i
yet
realized
their
sting
of
truth
i
was
in
america
when
my
sister
died
about
a
year
after
her
prediction
my
youngest
brother
bishnu
later
gave
me
the
details
roma
and
satish
were
in
calcutta
at
the
time
of
her
death
bishnu
told
me
that
morning
she
dressed
herself
in
her
bridal
finery
this
special
costume
satish
inquired
is
my
last
day
of
service
to
you
on
earth
roma
replied
a
short
time
later
she
had
a
heart
attack
as
her
son
was
rushing
out
for
aid
she
said
do
not
leave
me
it
is
no
use
i
shall
be
gone
before
a
doctor
could
arrive
ten
minutes
later
holding
the
feet
of
her
husband
in
reverence
roma
consciously
left
her
body
happily
and
without
suffering
satish
became
very
reclusive
after
his
wife
death
bishnu
continued
one
day
he
and
i
were
looking
at
a
large
smiling
photograph
of
roma
do
you
smile
satish
suddenly
exclaimed
as
though
his
wife
were
present
think
you
were
clever
in
arranging
to
go
before
me
i
shall
prove
that
you
can
not
long
remain
away
from
me
soon
i
shall
join
you
although
at
this
time
satish
had
fully
recovered
from
his
sickness
and
was
enjoying
excellent
health
he
died
without
apparent
cause
shortly
after
his
strange
remark
before
the
photograph
thus
prophetically
passed
my
dearly
beloved
eldest
sister
roma
and
her
husband
who
changed
at
dakshineswar
from
an
ordinary
worldly
man
to
a
silent
saint
goddess
the
hindu
wife
believes
it
is
a
sign
of
spiritual
advancement
if
she
dies
before
her
husband
as
a
proof
of
her
loyal
service
to
him
or
dying
in
harness
chapter
i
receive
my
university
degree
you
ignore
your
textbook
assignments
in
philosophy
no
doubt
you
are
depending
on
an
unlaborious
to
get
you
through
the
examinations
but
unless
you
apply
yourself
in
a
more
scholarly
manner
i
shall
see
to
it
that
you
do
pass
this
course
professor
ghoshal
of
serampore
college
was
addressing
me
sternly
if
i
failed
to
pass
his
final
written
classroom
test
i
would
be
ineligible
to
take
the
conclusive
examinations
these
are
formulated
by
the
faculty
of
calcutta
university
which
numbers
serampore
college
among
its
affiliated
branches
a
student
in
indian
universities
who
is
unsuccessful
in
one
subject
in
the
finals
must
be
examined
anew
in
all
his
subjects
the
following
year
my
instructors
at
serampore
college
usually
treated
me
with
kindness
not
untinged
by
an
amused
tolerance
mukunda
is
a
bit
with
religion
thus
summing
me
up
they
tactfully
spared
me
the
embarrassment
of
answering
classroom
questions
they
trusted
the
final
written
tests
to
eliminate
me
from
the
list
of
candidates
the
judgment
passed
by
my
fellow
students
was
expressed
in
their
nickname
for
mad
monk
i
took
an
ingenious
step
to
nullify
professor
ghoshal
threat
to
me
of
failure
in
philosophy
when
the
results
of
the
final
tests
were
about
to
be
publicly
announced
i
asked
a
classmate
to
accompany
me
to
the
professor
study
come
along
i
want
a
witness
i
told
my
companion
i
shall
be
very
much
disappointed
if
i
have
not
succeeded
in
outwitting
the
instructor
professor
ghoshal
shook
his
head
after
i
had
inquired
what
rating
he
had
given
my
paper
you
are
not
among
those
who
have
passed
he
said
in
triumph
he
hunted
through
a
large
pile
on
his
desk
your
paper
is
here
at
all
you
have
failed
in
any
case
through
at
the
examination
i
chuckled
sir
i
was
there
may
i
look
through
the
stack
myself
the
professor
nonplused
gave
his
permission
i
quickly
found
my
paper
where
i
had
carefully
omitted
any
identification
mark
except
my
roll
call
number
unwarned
by
the
red
flag
of
my
name
the
instructor
had
given
a
high
rating
to
my
answers
even
though
they
were
unembellished
by
textbook
quotations
seeing
through
my
trick
he
now
thundered
sheer
brazen
luck
he
added
hopefully
you
are
sure
to
fail
in
the
finals
for
the
tests
in
my
other
subjects
i
received
some
coaching
particularly
from
my
dear
friend
and
cousin
prabhas
chandra
ghose
son
of
my
uncle
sarada
i
staggered
painfully
but
the
lowest
possible
passing
all
my
final
tests
now
after
four
years
of
college
i
was
eligible
to
sit
for
the
examinations
nevertheless
i
hardly
expected
to
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
the
serampore
college
finals
were
child
play
compared
to
the
stiff
ones
which
would
be
set
by
calcutta
university
for
the
degree
my
almost
daily
visits
to
sri
yukteswar
had
left
me
little
time
to
enter
the
college
halls
there
it
was
my
presence
rather
than
my
absence
that
brought
forth
ejaculations
of
amazement
from
my
classmates
my
customary
routine
was
to
set
out
on
my
bicycle
about
in
the
morning
in
one
hand
i
would
carry
an
offering
for
my
few
flowers
from
the
garden
of
my
panthi
boardinghouse
greeting
me
affably
master
would
invite
me
to
lunch
i
invariably
accepted
with
alacrity
glad
to
banish
the
thought
of
college
for
the
day
after
hours
with
sri
yukteswar
listening
to
his
incomparable
flow
of
wisdom
or
helping
with
ashram
duties
i
would
reluctantly
depart
around
midnight
for
the
panthi
occasionally
i
stayed
all
night
with
my
guru
so
happily
engrossed
in
his
conversation
that
i
scarcely
noticed
when
darkness
changed
into
dawn
one
night
about
eleven
as
i
was
putting
on
my
shoes
in
preparation
for
the
ride
to
the
boardinghouse
master
questioned
me
gravely
when
do
your
examinations
start
five
days
hence
sir
i
hope
you
are
in
readiness
for
them
transfixed
with
alarm
i
held
one
shoe
in
the
air
sir
i
protested
you
know
how
my
days
have
been
passed
with
you
rather
than
with
the
professors
how
can
i
enact
a
farce
by
appearing
for
those
difficult
finals
sri
yukteswar
eyes
were
turned
piercingly
on
mine
you
must
appear
his
tone
was
coldly
peremptory
we
should
not
give
cause
for
your
father
and
other
relatives
to
criticize
your
preference
for
ashram
life
just
promise
me
that
you
will
be
present
for
the
examinations
answer
them
the
best
way
you
can
uncontrollable
tears
were
coursing
down
my
face
i
felt
that
master
command
was
unreasonable
and
that
his
interest
was
to
say
the
least
belated
i
will
appear
if
you
wish
it
i
said
amidst
sobs
but
no
time
remains
for
proper
preparation
under
my
breath
i
muttered
i
will
fill
up
the
sheets
with
your
teachings
in
answer
to
the
questions
when
i
entered
the
hermitage
the
following
day
at
my
usual
hour
i
presented
my
bouquet
with
a
certain
mournful
solemnity
sri
yukteswar
laughed
at
my
woebegone
air
mukunda
has
the
lord
ever
failed
you
at
an
examination
or
elsewhere
no
sir
i
responded
warmly
grateful
memories
came
in
a
revivifying
flood
not
laziness
but
burning
zeal
for
god
has
prevented
you
from
seeking
college
honors
my
guru
said
kindly
after
a
silence
he
quoted
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
for
the
thousandth
time
i
felt
my
burdens
lifted
in
presence
when
we
had
finished
our
early
lunch
he
suggested
that
i
return
to
the
panthi
does
your
friend
romesh
chandra
dutt
still
live
in
your
boardinghouse
yes
sir
get
in
touch
with
him
the
lord
will
inspire
him
to
help
you
with
the
examinations
very
well
sir
but
romesh
is
unusually
busy
he
is
the
honor
man
in
our
class
and
carries
a
heavier
course
than
the
others
master
waved
aside
my
objections
romesh
will
find
time
for
you
now
go
i
bicycled
back
to
the
panthi
the
first
person
i
met
in
the
boardinghouse
compound
was
the
scholarly
romesh
as
though
his
days
were
quite
free
he
obligingly
agreed
to
my
diffident
request
of
course
i
am
at
your
service
he
spent
several
hours
of
that
afternoon
and
of
succeeding
days
in
coaching
me
in
my
various
subjects
i
believe
many
questions
in
english
literature
will
be
centered
in
the
route
of
childe
harold
he
told
me
we
must
get
an
atlas
at
once
i
hastened
to
the
home
of
my
uncle
sarada
and
borrowed
an
atlas
romesh
marked
the
european
map
at
the
places
visited
by
romantic
traveler
a
few
classmates
had
gathered
around
to
listen
to
the
tutoring
romesh
is
advising
you
wrongly
one
of
them
commented
to
me
at
the
end
of
a
session
usually
only
fifty
per
cent
of
the
questions
are
about
the
books
the
other
half
will
involve
the
lives
when
i
sat
for
the
examination
in
english
literature
the
following
day
my
first
glance
at
the
questions
caused
tears
of
gratitude
to
pour
forth
wetting
my
paper
the
classroom
monitor
came
to
my
desk
and
made
a
sympathetic
inquiry
my
guru
foretold
that
romesh
would
help
me
i
explained
look
the
very
questions
dictated
to
me
by
romesh
are
here
on
the
examination
sheet
fortunately
for
me
there
are
very
few
questions
this
year
on
english
authors
whose
lives
are
wrapped
in
deep
mystery
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
my
boardinghouse
was
in
an
uproar
when
i
returned
the
boys
who
had
been
ridiculing
romesh
method
of
coaching
looked
at
me
in
awe
almost
deafening
me
with
congratulations
during
the
week
of
the
examinations
i
spent
many
hours
with
romesh
who
formulated
questions
that
he
thought
were
likely
to
be
set
by
the
professors
day
by
day
romesh
questions
appeared
in
almost
the
same
form
on
the
examination
sheets
the
news
was
widely
circulated
in
the
college
that
something
resembling
a
miracle
was
occurring
and
that
success
seemed
probable
for
the
mad
monk
i
made
no
attempt
to
hide
the
facts
of
the
case
the
local
professors
were
powerless
to
alter
the
questions
which
had
been
arranged
by
calcutta
university
thinking
over
the
examination
in
english
literature
i
realized
one
morning
that
i
had
made
a
serious
error
one
section
of
the
questions
had
been
divided
into
two
parts
of
a
or
b
and
c
or
instead
of
answering
one
question
from
each
part
i
had
carelessly
answered
both
questions
in
group
i
and
had
failed
to
consider
anything
in
group
ii
the
best
mark
i
could
score
in
that
paper
would
be
three
less
than
the
passing
mark
of
i
rushed
to
master
and
poured
out
my
troubles
sir
i
have
made
an
unpardonable
blunder
i
do
deserve
the
divine
blessings
through
romesh
i
am
quite
unworthy
cheer
up
mukunda
sri
yukteswar
tones
were
light
and
unconcerned
he
pointed
to
the
blue
vault
of
the
heavens
it
is
more
possible
for
the
sun
and
moon
to
interchange
their
positions
in
space
than
it
is
for
you
to
fail
in
getting
your
degree
i
left
the
hermitage
in
a
more
tranquil
mood
though
it
seemed
mathematically
inconceivable
that
i
could
pass
i
looked
once
or
twice
apprehensively
into
the
sky
the
lord
of
day
appeared
to
be
securely
anchored
in
his
customary
orbit
as
i
reached
the
panthi
i
overheard
a
classmate
remark
i
have
just
learned
that
this
year
for
the
first
time
the
required
passing
mark
in
english
literature
has
been
lowered
i
entered
the
boy
room
with
such
speed
that
he
looked
up
in
alarm
i
questioned
him
eagerly
monk
he
said
laughingly
why
this
sudden
interest
in
scholastic
matters
why
cry
in
the
eleventh
hour
but
it
is
true
that
the
passing
mark
has
just
been
lowered
to
points
a
few
joyous
leaps
took
me
into
my
own
room
where
i
sank
to
my
knees
and
praised
the
mathematical
perfections
of
my
divine
father
every
day
i
thrilled
with
the
consciousness
of
a
spiritual
presence
that
i
clearly
felt
to
be
guiding
me
through
romesh
a
significant
incident
occurred
in
connection
with
the
examination
in
bengali
romesh
who
had
touched
little
on
that
subject
called
me
back
one
morning
as
i
was
leaving
the
boardinghouse
on
my
way
to
the
examination
hall
there
is
romesh
shouting
for
you
a
classmate
said
to
me
impatiently
do
return
we
shall
be
late
at
the
hall
ignoring
the
advice
i
ran
back
to
the
house
the
bengali
examination
is
usually
easily
passed
by
our
bengali
boys
romesh
told
me
but
i
have
just
had
a
hunch
that
this
year
the
professors
have
planned
to
massacre
the
students
by
asking
questions
from
our
ancient
literature
my
friend
then
briefly
outlined
two
stories
from
the
life
of
vidyasagar
a
renowned
philanthropist
i
thanked
romesh
and
quickly
bicycled
to
the
college
hall
the
examination
sheet
in
bengali
proved
to
contain
two
parts
the
first
instruction
was
write
two
instances
of
the
charities
of
vidyasagar
as
i
transferred
to
the
paper
the
lore
that
i
had
so
recently
acquired
i
whispered
a
few
words
of
thanksgiving
that
i
had
heeded
romesh
summons
had
i
been
ignorant
of
vidyasagar
benefactions
to
mankind
including
ultimately
myself
i
could
not
have
passed
the
bengali
examination
failing
in
one
subject
i
would
have
been
forced
to
stand
examination
anew
in
all
subjects
the
following
year
such
a
prospect
was
understandably
abhorrent
the
second
instruction
on
the
sheet
read
write
an
essay
in
bengali
on
the
life
of
the
man
who
has
most
inspired
you
gentle
reader
i
need
not
inform
you
what
man
i
chose
for
my
theme
as
i
covered
page
after
page
with
praise
of
my
guru
i
smiled
to
realize
that
my
muttered
prediction
was
coming
true
i
will
fill
up
the
sheets
with
your
teachings
i
had
not
felt
inclined
to
question
romesh
about
my
course
in
philosophy
trusting
my
long
training
under
sri
yukteswar
i
safely
disregarded
the
textbook
explanations
the
highest
mark
given
to
any
of
my
papers
was
the
one
in
philosophy
my
score
in
all
other
subjects
was
just
barely
within
the
passing
mark
it
is
a
pleasure
to
record
that
my
unselfish
friend
romesh
received
his
own
degree
cum
laude
father
was
wreathed
in
smiles
at
my
graduation
i
hardly
thought
you
would
pass
mukunda
he
confessed
you
spend
so
much
time
with
your
guru
master
had
indeed
correctly
detected
the
unspoken
criticism
of
my
father
for
years
i
had
been
uncertain
that
i
would
ever
see
the
day
when
an
would
follow
my
name
i
seldom
use
the
title
without
reflecting
that
it
was
a
divine
gift
conferred
on
me
for
reasons
somewhat
obscure
occasionally
i
hear
college
men
remark
that
very
little
of
their
crammed
knowledge
remained
with
them
after
graduation
that
admission
consoles
me
a
bit
for
my
undoubted
academic
deficiencies
on
the
day
i
received
my
degree
from
calcutta
university
i
knelt
at
my
guru
feet
and
thanked
him
for
all
the
blessings
flowing
from
his
life
into
mine
get
up
mukunda
he
said
indulgently
the
lord
simply
found
it
more
convenient
to
make
you
a
graduate
than
to
rearrange
the
sun
and
moon
i
must
do
professor
ghoshal
the
justice
of
admitting
that
the
strained
relationship
between
us
was
not
due
to
any
fault
of
his
but
solely
to
my
absences
from
classes
and
inattention
in
them
professor
ghoshal
was
and
is
a
remarkable
orator
with
vast
philosophical
knowledge
in
later
years
we
came
to
a
cordial
although
my
cousin
and
i
have
the
same
family
name
of
ghosh
prabhas
has
accustomed
himself
to
transliterating
his
name
in
english
as
ghose
therefore
i
follow
his
own
spelling
here
a
disciple
always
removes
his
shoes
in
an
indian
hermitage
matthew
chapter
i
become
a
monk
of
the
swami
order
master
my
father
has
been
anxious
for
me
to
accept
an
executive
position
with
the
railway
but
i
have
definitely
refused
it
i
added
hopefully
sir
will
you
not
make
me
a
monk
of
the
swami
order
i
looked
pleadingly
at
my
guru
during
preceding
years
in
order
to
test
the
depth
of
my
determination
he
had
refused
this
same
request
today
however
he
smiled
graciously
very
well
tomorrow
i
will
initiate
you
into
swamiship
he
went
on
quietly
i
am
happy
that
you
have
persisted
in
your
desire
to
be
a
monk
lahiri
mahasaya
often
said
you
do
invite
god
to
be
your
summer
guest
he
wo
come
in
the
winter
of
your
life
dear
master
i
could
never
falter
in
my
goal
to
belong
to
the
swami
order
like
your
revered
self
i
smiled
at
him
with
measureless
affection
he
that
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
lord
how
he
may
please
the
lord
but
he
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
of
the
world
how
he
may
please
his
wife
i
had
analyzed
the
lives
of
many
of
my
friends
who
after
undergoing
certain
spiritual
discipline
had
then
married
launched
on
the
sea
of
worldly
responsibilities
they
had
forgotten
their
resolutions
to
meditate
deeply
to
allot
god
a
secondary
place
in
life
was
to
me
inconceivable
though
he
is
the
sole
owner
of
the
cosmos
silently
showering
us
with
gifts
from
life
to
life
one
thing
yet
remains
which
he
does
not
own
and
which
each
human
heart
is
empowered
to
withhold
or
love
the
creator
in
taking
infinite
pains
to
shroud
with
mystery
his
presence
in
every
atom
of
creation
could
have
had
but
one
sensitive
desire
that
men
seek
him
only
through
free
will
with
what
velvet
glove
of
every
humility
has
he
not
covered
the
iron
hand
of
omnipotence
the
following
day
was
one
of
the
most
memorable
in
my
life
it
was
a
sunny
thursday
i
remember
in
july
a
few
weeks
after
my
graduation
from
college
on
the
inner
balcony
of
his
serampore
hermitage
master
dipped
a
new
piece
of
white
silk
into
a
dye
of
ocher
the
traditional
color
of
the
swami
order
after
the
cloth
had
dried
my
guru
draped
it
around
me
as
a
renunciate
robe
someday
you
will
go
to
the
west
where
silk
is
preferred
he
said
as
a
symbol
i
have
chosen
for
you
this
silk
material
instead
of
the
customary
cotton
in
india
where
monks
embrace
the
ideal
of
poverty
a
swami
is
an
unusual
sight
many
yogis
however
wear
garments
of
silk
which
preserves
certain
subtle
bodily
currents
better
than
cotton
i
am
averse
to
ceremonies
sri
yukteswar
remarked
i
will
make
you
a
swami
in
the
bidwat
manner
the
bibidisa
or
elaborate
initiation
into
swamiship
includes
a
fire
ceremony
during
which
symbolical
funeral
rites
are
performed
the
physical
body
of
the
disciple
is
represented
as
dead
cremated
in
the
flame
of
wisdom
the
swami
is
then
given
a
chant
such
as
this
atma
is
brahma
or
thou
art
that
or
i
am
he
sri
yukteswar
however
with
his
love
of
simplicity
dispensed
with
all
formal
rites
and
merely
asked
me
to
select
a
new
name
i
will
give
you
the
privilege
of
choosing
it
yourself
he
said
smiling
yogananda
i
replied
after
a
moment
thought
the
name
literally
means
bliss
ananda
through
divine
union
yoga
be
it
so
forsaking
your
family
name
of
mukunda
lal
ghosh
henceforth
you
shall
be
called
yogananda
of
the
giri
branch
of
the
swami
order
as
i
knelt
before
sri
yukteswar
and
for
the
first
time
heard
him
pronounce
my
new
name
my
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
how
lovingly
and
tirelessly
had
he
labored
that
the
boy
mukunda
be
someday
transformed
into
the
monk
yogananda
i
joyfully
sang
a
few
verses
from
the
long
sanskrit
chant
of
lord
shankara
mind
nor
intellect
nor
ego
feeling
sky
nor
earth
nor
metals
am
i
am

i
am
he
blessed

i
am
he
no
birth
no
death
no
caste
have
i
father
mother
have
i
none
i
am
he
i
am
he
blessed
spirit
i
am
he
beyond
the
flights
of
fancy
formless
am
i
permeating
the
limbs
of
all
life
bondage
i
do
not
fear
i
am
free
ever
free
i
am
he
i
am
he
blessed
spirit
i
am
he
every
swami
belongs
to
the
ancient
monastic
order
which
was
organized
in
its
present
form
by
shankara
because
it
is
a
formal
order
with
an
unbroken
line
of
saintly
representatives
serving
as
active
leaders
no
man
can
give
himself
the
title
of
swami
he
rightfully
receives
it
only
from
another
swami
all
monks
thus
trace
their
spiritual
lineage
to
one
common
guru
lord
shankara
by
vows
of
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
to
the
spiritual
teacher
many
catholic
christian
monastic
orders
resemble
the
order
of
swamis
in
addition
to
his
new
name
usually
ending
in
ananda
the
swami
takes
a
title
which
indicates
his
formal
connection
with
one
of
the
ten
subdivisions
of
the
swami
order
these
dasanamis
or
ten
agnomens
include
the
giri
mountain
to
which
sri
yukteswar
and
hence
myself
belong
among
the
other
branches
are
the
sagar
sea
bharati
land
aranya
forest
puri
tract
tirtha
place
of
pilgrimage
and
saraswati
wisdom
of
nature
the
new
name
received
by
a
swami
thus
has
a
twofold
significance
and
represents
the
attainment
of
supreme
bliss
ananda
through
some
divine
quality
or
wisdom
devotion
service
through
a
harmony
with
nature
as
expressed
in
her
infinite
vastness
of
oceans
mountains
skies
the
ideal
of
selfless
service
to
all
mankind
and
of
renunciation
of
personal
ties
and
ambitions
leads
the
majority
of
swamis
to
engage
actively
in
humanitarian
and
educational
work
in
india
or
occasionally
in
foreign
lands
ignoring
all
prejudices
of
caste
creed
class
color
sex
or
race
a
swami
follows
the
precepts
of
human
brotherhood
his
goal
is
absolute
unity
with
spirit
imbuing
his
waking
and
sleeping
consciousness
with
the
thought
i
am
he
he
roams
contentedly
in
the
world
but
not
of
it
thus
only
may
he
justify
his
title
of
who
seeks
to
achieve
union
with
the
swa
or
self
it
is
needless
to
add
that
not
all
formally
titled
swamis
are
equally
successful
in
reaching
their
high
goal
sri
yukteswar
was
both
a
swami
and
a
yogi
a
swami
formally
a
monk
by
virtue
of
his
connection
with
the
ancient
order
is
not
always
a
yogi
anyone
who
practices
a
scientific
technique
of
is
a
yogi
he
may
be
either
married
or
unmarried
either
a
worldly
man
or
one
of
formal
religious
ties
a
swami
may
conceivably
follow
only
the
path
of
dry
reasoning
of
cold
renunciation
but
a
yogi
engages
himself
in
a
definite
procedure
by
which
the
body
and
mind
are
disciplined
and
the
soul
liberated
taking
nothing
for
granted
on
emotional
grounds
or
by
faith
a
yogi
practices
a
thoroughly
tested
series
of
exercises
which
were
first
mapped
out
by
the
early
rishis
yoga
has
produced
in
every
age
of
india
men
who
became
truly
free
truly
like
any
other
science
yoga
is
applicable
to
people
of
every
clime
and
time
the
theory
advanced
by
certain
ignorant
writers
that
yoga
is
unsuitable
for
westerners
is
wholly
false
and
has
lamentably
prevented
many
sincere
students
from
seeking
its
manifold
blessings
yoga
is
a
method
for
restraining
the
natural
turbulence
of
thoughts
which
otherwise
impartially
prevent
all
men
of
all
lands
from
glimpsing
their
true
nature
of
spirit
yoga
can
not
know
a
barrier
of
east
and
west
any
more
than
does
the
healing
and
equitable
light
of
the
sun
so
long
as
man
possesses
a
mind
with
its
restless
thoughts
so
long
will
there
be
a
universal
need
for
yoga
or
control
illustration
the
lord
in
his
aspect
as
shiva
not
a
historical
personage
like
krishna
shiva
is
the
name
given
to
god
in
the
last
aspect
of
his
threefold
nature
shiva
the
annihilator
of
maya
or
delusion
is
symbolically
represented
in
the
scriptures
as
the
lord
of
renunciates
the
king
of
yogis
in
hindu
art
he
is
always
shown
with
the
new
moon
in
his
hair
and
wearing
a
garland
of
hooded
snakes
ancient
emblem
of
evil
overcome
and
perfect
wisdom
the
single
eye
of
omniscience
is
open
on
his
see
the
ancient
rishi
patanjali
defines
yoga
as
control
of
the
fluctuations
of
the
his
very
short
and
masterly
expositions
the
yoga
sutras
form
one
of
the
six
systems
of
hindu
philosophy
in
contradistinction
to
western
philosophies
all
six
hindu
systems
embody
not
only
theoretical
but
practical
teachings
in
addition
to
every
conceivable
ontological
inquiry
the
six
systems
formulate
six
definite
disciplines
aimed
at
the
permanent
removal
of
suffering
and
the
attainment
of
timeless
bliss
the
common
thread
linking
all
six
systems
is
the
declaration
that
no
true
freedom
for
man
is
possible
without
knowledge
of
the
ultimate
reality
the
later
upanishads
uphold
the
yoga
sutras
among
the
six
systems
as
containing
the
most
efficacious
methods
for
achieving
direct
perception
of
truth
through
the
practical
techniques
of
yoga
man
leaves
behind
forever
the
barren
realms
of
speculation
and
cognizes
in
experience
the
veritable
essence
the
yoga
system
as
outlined
by
patanjali
is
known
as
the
eightfold
path
the
first
steps
yama
and
niyama
require
observance
of
ten
negative
and
positive
of
injury
to
others
of
untruthfulness
of
stealing
of
incontinence
of
which
brings
obligations
and
purity
of
body
and
mind
contentment
study
and
devotion
to
god
the
next
steps
are
asana
right
posture
the
spinal
column
must
be
held
straight
and
the
body
firm
in
a
comfortable
position
for
meditation
pranayama
control
of
prana
subtle
life
currents
and
pratyahara
withdrawal
of
the
senses
from
external
objects
the
last
steps
are
forms
of
yoga
proper
dharana
concentration
holding
the
mind
to
one
thought
dhyana
meditation
and
samadhi
superconscious
perception
this
is
the
eightfold
path
of
yoga
which
leads
one
to
the
final
goal
of
kaivalya
absoluteness
a
term
which
might
be
more
comprehensibly
put
as
realization
of
the
truth
beyond
all
intellectual
apprehension
which
is
greater
one
may
ask
a
swami
or
a
yogi
if
and
when
final
oneness
with
god
is
achieved
the
distinctions
of
the
various
paths
disappear
the
bhagavad
gita
however
points
out
that
the
methods
of
yoga
are
its
techniques
are
not
meant
only
for
certain
types
and
temperaments
such
as
those
few
who
incline
toward
the
monastic
life
yoga
requires
no
formal
allegiance
because
the
yogic
science
satisfies
a
universal
need
it
has
a
natural
universal
applicability
a
true
yogi
may
remain
dutifully
in
the
world
there
he
is
like
butter
on
water
and
not
like
the
milk
of
unchurned
and
undisciplined
humanity
to
fulfill
one
earthly
responsibilities
is
indeed
the
higher
path
provided
the
yogi
maintaining
a
mental
uninvolvement
with
egotistical
desires
plays
his
part
as
a
willing
instrument
of
god
there
are
a
number
of
great
souls
living
in
american
or
european
or
other
bodies
today
who
though
they
may
never
have
heard
the
words
yogi
and
swami
are
yet
true
exemplars
of
those
terms
through
their
disinterested
service
to
mankind
or
through
their
mastery
over
passions
and
thoughts
or
through
their
single
hearted
love
of
god
or
through
their
great
powers
of
concentration
they
are
in
a
sense
yogis
they
have
set
themselves
the
goal
of
these
men
could
rise
to
even
greater
heights
if
they
were
taught
the
definite
science
of
yoga
which
makes
possible
a
more
conscious
direction
of
one
mind
and
life
yoga
has
been
superficially
misunderstood
by
certain
western
writers
but
its
critics
have
never
been
its
practitioners
among
many
thoughtful
tributes
to
yoga
may
be
mentioned
one
by
jung
the
famous
swiss
psychologist
when
a
religious
method
recommends
itself
as
it
can
be
certain
of
its
public
in
the
west
yoga
fulfills
this
expectation
jung
writes
quite
apart
from
the
charm
of
the
new
and
the
fascination
of
the
there
is
good
cause
for
yoga
to
have
many
adherents
it
offers
the
possibility
of
controllable
experience
and
thus
satisfies
the
scientific
need
of
and
besides
this
by
reason
of
its
breadth
and
depth
its
venerable
age
its
doctrine
and
method
which
include
every
phase
of
life
it
promises
possibilities
every
religious
or
philosophical
practice
means
a
psychological
discipline
that
is
a
method
of
mental
hygiene
the
manifold
purely
bodily
procedures
of
yoga
also
mean
a
physiological
hygiene
which
is
superior
to
ordinary
gymnastics
and
breathing
exercises
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
merely
mechanistic
and
scientific
but
also
philosophical
in
its
training
of
the
parts
of
the
body
it
unites
them
with
the
whole
of
the
spirit
as
is
quite
clear
for
instance
in
the
pranayama
exercises
where
prana
is
both
the
breath
and
the
universal
dynamics
of
the
cosmos
when
the
thing
which
the
individual
is
doing
is
also
a
cosmic
event
the
effect
experienced
in
the
body
the
innervation
unites
with
the
emotion
of
the
spirit
the
universal
idea
and
out
of
this
there
develops
a
lively
unity
which
no
technique
however
scientific
can
produce
yoga
practice
is
unthinkable
and
would
also
be
ineffectual
without
the
concepts
on
which
yoga
is
based
it
combines
the
bodily
and
the
spiritual
with
each
other
in
an
extraordinarily
complete
way
in
the
east
where
these
ideas
and
practices
have
developed
and
where
for
several
thousand
years
an
unbroken
tradition
has
created
the
necessary
spiritual
foundations
yoga
is
as
i
can
readily
believe
the
perfect
and
appropriate
method
of
fusing
body
and
mind
together
so
that
they
form
a
unity
which
is
scarcely
to
be
questioned
this
unity
creates
a
psychological
disposition
which
makes
possible
intuitions
that
transcend
consciousness
the
western
day
is
indeed
nearing
when
the
inner
science
of
will
be
found
as
necessary
as
the
outer
conquest
of
nature
this
new
atomic
age

see

indisputable

brother
ananta
and
sister
nalini
ananta
can
not
live
the
sands
of
his
karma
for
this
life
have
run
out
these
inexorable
words
reached
my
inner
consciousness
as
i
sat
one
morning
in
deep
meditation
shortly
after
i
had
entered
the
swami
order
i
paid
a
visit
to
my
birthplace
gorakhpur
as
a
guest
of
my
elder
brother
ananta
a
sudden
illness
confined
him
to
his
bed
i
nursed
him
lovingly
the
solemn
inward
pronouncement
filled
me
with
grief
i
felt
that
i
could
not
bear
to
remain
longer
in
gorakhpur
only
to
see
my
brother
removed
before
my
helpless
gaze
amidst
uncomprehending
criticism
from
my
relatives
i
left
india
on
the
first
available
boat
it
cruised
along
burma
and
the
china
sea
to
japan
i
disembarked
at
kobe
where
i
spent
only
a
few
days
my
heart
was
too
heavy
for
sightseeing
on
the
return
trip
to
india
the
boat
touched
at
shanghai
there
misra
the
ship
physician
guided
me
to
several
curio
shops
where
i
selected
various
presents
for
sri
yukteswar
and
my
family
and
friends
for
ananta
i
purchased
a
large
carved
bamboo
piece
no
sooner
had
the
chinese
salesman
handed
me
the
bamboo
souvenir
than
i
dropped
it
on
the
floor
crying
out
i
have
bought
this
for
my
dear
dead
brother
a
clear
realization
had
swept
over
me
that
his
soul
was
just
being
freed
in
the
infinite
the
souvenir
was
sharply
and
symbolically
cracked
by
its
fall
amidst
sobs
i
wrote
on
the
bamboo
surface
for
my
beloved
ananta
now
gone
my
companion
the
doctor
was
observing
these
proceedings
with
a
sardonic
smile
save
your
tears
he
remarked
why
shed
them
until
you
are
sure
he
is
dead
when
our
boat
reached
calcutta
misra
again
accompanied
me
my
youngest
brother
bishnu
was
waiting
to
greet
me
at
the
dock
i
know
ananta
has
departed
this
life
i
said
to
bishnu
before
he
had
had
time
to
speak
please
tell
me
and
the
doctor
here
when
ananta
died
bishnu
named
the
date
which
was
the
very
day
that
i
had
bought
the
souvenirs
in
shanghai
look
here
misra
ejaculated
do
let
any
word
of
this
get
around

professors
will
be

of

telepathy
to

course
which
is
already
long
enough
father
embraced
me
warmly
as
i
entered
our
gurpar
road
home
you
have
come
he
said
tenderly
two
large
tears
dropped
from
his
eyes
ordinarily
undemonstrative
he
had
never
before
shown
me
these
signs
of
affection
outwardly
the
grave
father
inwardly
he
possessed
the
melting
heart
of
a
mother
in
all
his
dealings
with
the
family
his
dual
parental
role
was
distinctly
manifest
soon
after
ananta
passing
my
younger
sister
nalini
was
brought
back
from
death
door
by
a
divine
healing
before
relating
the
story
i
will
refer
to
a
few
phases
of
her
earlier
life
the
childhood
relationship
between
nalini
and
myself
had
not
been
of
the
happiest
nature
i
was
very
thin
she
was
thinner
still
through
an
unconscious
motive
or
complex
which
psychiatrists
will
have
no
difficulty
in
identifying
i
often
used
to
tease
my
sister
about
her
cadaverous
appearance
her
retorts
were
equally
permeated
with
the
callous
frankness
of
extreme
youth
sometimes
mother
intervened
ending
the
childish
quarrels
temporarily
by
a
gentle
box
on
my
ear
as
the
elder
ear
time
passed
nalini
was
betrothed
to
a
young
calcutta
physician
panchanon
bose
he
received
a
generous
dowry
from
father
presumably
as
i
remarked
to
sister
to
compensate
the
for
his
fate
in
allying
himself
with
a
human
elaborate
marriage
rites
were
celebrated
in
due
time
on
the
wedding
night
i
joined
the
large
and
jovial
group
of
relatives
in
the
living
room
of
our
calcutta
home
the
bridegroom
was
leaning
on
an
immense
pillow
with
nalini
at
his
side
a
gorgeous
purple
silk
sari
could
not
alas
wholly
hide
her
angularity
i
sheltered
myself
behind
the
pillow
of
my
new
and
grinned
at
him
in
friendly
fashion
he
had
never
seen
nalini
until
the
day
of
the
nuptial
ceremony
when
he
finally
learned
what
he
was
getting
in
the
matrimonial
lottery
feeling
my
sympathy
bose
pointed
unobtrusively
to
nalini
and
whispered
in
my
ear
say
what
this
why
doctor
i
replied
it
is
a
skeleton
for
your
observation
convulsed
with
mirth
my
and
i
were
hard
put
to
it
to
maintain
the
proper
decorum
before
our
assembled
relatives
as
the
years
went
on
bose
endeared
himself
to
our
family
who
called
on
him
whenever
illness
arose
he
and
i
became
fast
friends
often
joking
together
usually
with
nalini
as
our
target
it
is
a
medical
curiosity
my
remarked
to
me
one
day
i
have
tried
everything
on
your
lean
liver
oil
butter
malt
honey
fish
meat
eggs
tonics
still
she
fails
to
bulge
even
of
an
inch
we
both
chuckled
a
few
days
later
i
visited
the
bose
home
my
errand
there
took
only
a
few
minutes
i
was
leaving
unnoticed
i
thought
by
nalini
as
i
reached
the
front
door
i
heard
her
voice
cordial
but
commanding
brother
come
here
you
are
not
going
to
give
me
the
slip
this
time
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
mounted
the
stairs
to
her
room
to
my
surprise
she
was
in
tears
dear
brother
she
said
let
us
bury
the
old
hatchet
i
see
that
your
feet
are
now
firmly
set
on
the
spiritual
path
i
want
to
become
like
you
in
every
way
she
added
hopefully
you
are
now
robust
in
appearance
can
you
help
me
my
husband
does
not
come
near
me
and
i
love
him
so
dearly
but
still
more
i
want
to
progress
in
even
if
i
must
remain
thin
and
unattractive
my
heart
was
deeply
touched
at
her
plea
our
new
friendship
steadily
progressed
one
day
she
asked
to
become
my
disciple
train
me
in
any
way
you
like
i
put
my
trust
in
god
instead
of
tonics
she
gathered
together
an
armful
of
medicines
and
poured
them
down
the
roof
drain
as
a
test
of
her
faith
i
asked
her
to
omit
from
her
diet
all
fish
meat
and
eggs
after
several
months
during
which
nalini
had
strictly
followed
the
various
rules
i
had
outlined
and
had
adhered
to
her
vegetarian
diet
in
spite
of
numerous
difficulties
i
paid
her
a
visit
sis
you
have
been
conscientiously
observing
the
spiritual
injunctions
your
reward
is
near
i
smiled
mischievously
how
plump
do
you
want
to
fat
as
our
aunt
who
has
seen
her
feet
in
years
no
but
i
long
to
be
as
stout
as
you
are
i
replied
solemnly
by
the
grace
of
god
as
i
have
spoken
truth
always
i
speak
truly
now
through
the
divine
blessings
your
body
shall
verily
change
from
today
in
one
month
it
shall
have
the
same
weight
as
mine
these
words
from
my
heart
found
fulfillment
in
thirty
days
weight
equalled
mine
the
new
roundness
gave
her
beauty
her
husband
fell
deeply
in
love
their
marriage
begun
so
inauspiciously
turned
out
to
be
ideally
happy
on
my
return
from
japan
i
learned
that
during
my
absence
nalini
had
been
stricken
with
typhoid
fever
i
rushed
to
her
home
and
was
aghast
to
find
her
reduced
to
a
mere
skeleton
she
was
in
a
coma
before
her
mind
became
confused
by
illness
my
told
me
she
often
said
brother
mukunda
were
here
i
would
not
be
faring
thus
he
added
despairingly
the
other
doctors
and
myself
see
no
hope
blood
dysentery
has
set
in
after
her
long
bout
with
typhoid
i
began
to
move
heaven
and
earth
with
my
prayers
engaging
an
nurse
who
gave
me
full
cooperation
i
applied
to
my
sister
various
yoga
techniques
of
healing
the
blood
dysentery
disappeared
but
bose
shook
his
head
mournfully
she
simply
has
no
more
blood
left
to
shed
she
will
recover
i
replied
stoutly
in
seven
days
her
fever
will
be
gone
a
week
later
i
was
thrilled
to
see
nalini
open
her
eyes
and
gaze
at
me
with
loving
recognition
from
that
day
her
recovery
was
swift
although
she
regained
her
usual
weight
she
bore
one
sad
scar
of
her
nearly
fatal
illness
her
legs
were
paralyzed
indian
and
english
specialists
pronounced
her
a
hopeless
cripple
the
incessant
war
for
her
life
which
i
had
waged
by
prayer
had
exhausted
me
i
went
to
serampore
to
ask
sri
yukteswar
help
his
eyes
expressed
deep
sympathy
as
i
told
him
of
nalini
plight
your
sister
legs
will
be
normal
at
the
end
of
one
month
he
added
let
her
wear
next
to
her
skin
a
band
with
an
unperforated
pearl
held
on
by
a
clasp
i
prostrated
myself
at
his
feet
with
joyful
relief
sir
you
are
a
master
your
word
of
her
recovery
is
enough
but
if
you
insist
i
shall
immediately
get
her
a
pearl
my
guru
nodded
yes
do
that
he
went
on
to
correctly
describe
the
physical
and
mental
characteristics
of
nalini
whom
he
had
never
seen
sir
i
inquired
is
this
an
astrological
analysis
you
do
not
know
her
birth
day
or
hour
sri
yukteswar
smiled
there
is
a
deeper
astrology
not
dependent
on
the
testimony
of
calendars
and
clocks
each
man
is
a
part
of
the
creator
or
cosmic
man
he
has
a
heavenly
body
as
well
as
one
of
earth
the
human
eye
sees
the
physical
form
but
the
inward
eye
penetrates
more
profoundly
even
to
the
universal
pattern
of
which
each
man
is

as

your

has
been
told
by
many
doctors
that
she
can
never
bear
children
assure
her
that
in

years
she
will

some

she
bore

your

my

said
the
presence
of
such
a
man
is
a
sanctification
on
the
whole
of
india
dear
brother
please
tell
sri
yukteswarji
that
through
you
i
humbly
count
myself
as
one
of
his
kriya
yoga
disciples
the
gracefully
draped
dress
of
indian
women
because
most
persons
in
india
are
thin
reasonable
plumpness
is
considered
very
desirable
the
hindu
scriptures
declare
that
those
who
habitually
speak
the
truth
will
develop
the
power
of
materializing
their
words
what
commands
they
utter
from
the
heart
will
come
true
in

chapter
the
science
of
kriya
yoga
the
science
of
kriya
yoga
mentioned
so
often
in
these
pages
became
widely
known
in
modern
india
through
the
instrumentality
of
lahiri
mahasaya
my
guru
guru
the
sanskrit
root
of
kriya
is
kri
to
do
to
act
and
react
the
same
root
is
found
in
the
word
karma
the
natural
principle
of
cause
and
effect
kriya
yoga
is
thus
union
yoga
with
the
infinite
through
a
certain
action
or
rite
a
yogi
who
faithfully
follows
its
technique
is
gradually
freed
from
karma
or
the
universal
chain
of
causation
because
of
certain
ancient
yogic
injunctions
i
can
not
give
a
full
explanation
of
kriya
yoga
in
the
pages
of
a
book
intended
for
the
general
public
the
actual
technique
must
be
learned
from
a
kriyaban
or
kriya
yogi
here
a
broad
reference
must
suffice
kriya
yoga
is
a
simple
psychophysiological
method
by
which
the
human
blood
is
decarbonized
and
recharged
with
oxygen
the
atoms
of
this
extra
oxygen
are
transmuted
into
life
current
to
rejuvenate
the
brain
and
spinal
centers
by
stopping
the
accumulation
of
venous
blood
the
yogi
is
able
to
lessen
or
prevent
the
decay
of
tissues
the
advanced
yogi
transmutes
his
cells
into
pure
energy
elijah
jesus
kabir
and
other
prophets
were
past
masters
in
the
use
of
kriya
or
a
similar
technique
by
which
they
caused
their
bodies
to
dematerialize
at
will
kriya
is
an
ancient
science
lahiri
mahasaya
received
it
from
his
guru
babaji
who
rediscovered
and
clarified
the
technique
after
it
had
been
lost
in
the
dark
ages
the
kriya
yoga
which
i
am
giving
to
the
world
through
you
in
this
nineteenth
century
babaji
told
lahiri
mahasaya
is
a
revival
of
the
same
science
which
krishna
gave
millenniums
ago
to
arjuna
and
which
was
later
known
to
patanjali
and
to
christ
john
paul
and
other
disciples
kriya
yoga
is
referred
to
by
krishna
india
greatest
prophet
in
a
stanza
of
the
bhagavad
gita
offering
inhaling
breath
into
the
outgoing
breath
and
offering
the
outgoing
breath
into
the
inhaling
breath
the
yogi
neutralizes
both
these
breaths
he
thus
releases
the
life
force
from
the
heart
and
brings
it
under
his
control
the
interpretation
is
the
yogi
arrests
decay
in
the
body
by
an
addition
of
life
force
and
arrests
the
mutations
of
growth
in
the
body
by
apan
eliminating
current
thus
neutralizing
decay
and
growth
by
quieting
the
heart
the
yogi
learns
life
control
krishna
also
relates
that
it
was
he
in
a
former
incarnation
who
communicated
the
indestructible
yoga
to
an
ancient
illuminato
vivasvat
who
gave
it
to
manu
the
great
legislator
he
in
turn
instructed
ikshwaku
the
father
of
india
solar
warrior
dynasty
passing
thus
from
one
to
another
the
royal
yoga
was
guarded
by
the
rishis
until
the
coming
of
the
materialistic
ages
then
due
to
priestly
secrecy
and
man
indifference
the
sacred
knowledge
gradually
became
inaccessible
kriya
yoga
is
mentioned
twice
by
the
ancient
sage
patanjali
foremost
exponent
of
yoga
who
wrote
kriya
yoga
consists
of
body
discipline
mental
control
and
meditating
on
aum
patanjali
speaks
of
god
as
the
actual
cosmic
sound
of
aum
heard
in
meditation
aum
is
the
creative
word
the
sound
of
the
vibratory
motor
even
the
soon
inwardly
hears
the
wondrous
sound
of
aum
receiving
this
blissful
spiritual
encouragement
the
devotee
becomes
assured
that
he
is
in
actual
touch
with
divine
realms
patanjali
refers
a
second
time
to
the
or
kriya
technique
thus
liberation
can
be
accomplished
by
that
pranayama
which
is
attained
by
disjoining
the
course
of
inspiration
and
expiration
paul
knew
kriya
yoga
or
a
technique
very
similar
to
it
by
which
he
could
switch
life
currents
to
and
from
the
senses
he
was
therefore
able
to
say
verily
i
protest
by
our
rejoicing
which
i
have
in
christ
i
die
daily
by
daily
withdrawing
his
bodily
life
force
he
united
it
by
yoga
union
with
the
rejoicing
eternal
bliss
of
the
christ
consciousness
in
that
felicitous
state
he
was
consciously
aware
of
being
dead
to
the
delusive
sensory
world
of
maya
in
the
initial
states
of
sabikalpa
samadhi
the
devotee
consciousness
merges
with
the
cosmic
spirit
his
life
force
is
withdrawn
from
the
body
which
appears
dead
or
motionless
and
rigid
the
yogi
is
fully
aware
of
his
bodily
condition
of
suspended
animation
as
he
progresses
to
higher
spiritual
states
nirbikalpa
samadhi
however
he
communes
with
god
without
bodily
fixation
and
in
his
ordinary
waking
consciousness
even
in
the
midst
of
exacting
worldly
duties
kriya
yoga
is
an
instrument
through
which
human
evolution
can
be
quickened
sri
yukteswar
explained
to
his
students
the
ancient
yogis
discovered
that
the
secret
of
cosmic
consciousness
is
intimately
linked
with
breath
mastery
this
is
india
unique
and
deathless
contribution
to
the

is
ordinarily
absorbed
in
maintaining

freed
for
higher
activities
by
a
method
of
calming
and
stilling
the
ceaseless
demands
of
the

the
kriya
yogi
mentally
directs
his
life

to
revolve
upward
and
downward
around
the
six
spinal

all

are
thus
affected
by

the
ancient
rishis
discovered
that

him
forward
on
his

the
scriptures
aver
that

years
of
normal
diseaseless
evolution
to
perfect
his
human
brain
sufficiently
to
express

consciousness
one

the
yogi
in
one
day
the
equivalent
of
one
thousand
years
of
natural
evolution
years
of
evolution
in
one
year
in
three
years
a
kriya
yogi
can
thus
accomplish
by

the

result
which
nature
brings
to
pass
in
a
million
years
the
kriya
short
cut
of

can
be
taken
only
by
deeply
developed
yogis
with
the
guidance
of
a
guru
such
yogis
have
carefully
prepared
their
bodies
and
brains
to
receive
the
power
created
by
intensive
practice
the
kriya
beginner
employs
his
yogic
exercise
only
fourteen
to
times
twice
daily
a
number
of
yogis
achieve
emancipation
in
six
or
twelve
or
or
years
a
yogi
who
dies
before
achieving
full
realization
carries
with
him
the
good
karma
of
his
past
kriya
effort
in
his
new
life
he
is
harmoniously
propelled
toward
his
infinite
goal
the
body
of
the
average
man
is
like
a
lamp
which
can
not
accommodate
the
billion
watts
of
power
roused
by
an
excessive
practice
of

through
gradual
and

of

kriya
yoga
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
unscientific
breathing
exercises
taught
by
a
number
of
misguided
zealots
their
attempts
to
forcibly
hold
breath
in
the
lungs
is
not
only
unnatural
but
decidedly
unpleasant
kriya
on
the
other
hand
is
accompanied
from
the
very
beginning
by
an
accession
of
peace
and
by
soothing
sensations
of
regenerative
effect
in
the
spine
the
ancient
yogic
technique
converts
the
breath
into
mind
by
spiritual
advancement
one
is
able
to
cognize
the
breath
as
an
act
of
many
illustrations
could
be
given
of
the
mathematical
relationship
between
man
respiratory
rate
and
the
variations
in
his
states
of
consciousness
a
person
whose
attention
is
wholly
engrossed
as
in
following
some
closely
knit
intellectual
argument
or
in
attempting
some
delicate
or
difficult
physical
feat
automatically
breathes
very
slowly
fixity
of
attention
depends
on
slow
breathing
quick
or
uneven
breaths
are
an
inevitable
accompaniment
of
harmful
emotional
states
fear
lust
anger
the
restless
monkey
breathes
at
the
rate
of
times
a
minute
in
contrast
to

average
of
times
the
elephant
tortoise
snake
and
other
animals
noted
for
their
longevity
have
a
respiratory
rate
which
is
less
than
man
the
tortoise
for
instance
who
may
attain
the
age
of
years
breathes
only
times
per
minute
the
rejuvenating
effects
of
sleep
are
due
to
man
temporary
unawareness
of
body
and
breathing
the
sleeping
man
becomes
a
yogi
each
night
he
unconsciously
performs
the
yogic
rite
of
releasing
himself
from
bodily
identification
and
of
merging
the
life
force
with
healing
currents
in
the
main
brain
region
and
the
six
of
his
spinal
centers
the
sleeper
thus
dips
unknowingly
into
the
reservoir
of
cosmic
energy
which
sustains
all
life
the
voluntary
yogi
performs
a
simple
natural
process
consciously
not
unconsciously
like
the
sleeper
the
kriya
yogi
uses
his
technique
to
saturate
and
feed
all
his
physical
cells
with
undecaying
light
and
keep
them
in
a
magnetized
state
he
scientifically
makes
breath
unnecessary
without
producing
the
states
of
subconscious
sleep
or
unconsciousness
by
kriya
the
outgoing
life
force
is
not
wasted
and
abused
in
the
senses
but
constrained
to
reunite
with
subtler
spinal
energies
by
such
reinforcement
of
life
the
yogi
body
and
brain
cells
are
electrified
with
the
spiritual
elixir
thus
he
removes
himself
from
studied
observance
of
natural
laws
which
can
only
take
circuitous
means
as
given
by
proper
food
sunlight
and
harmonious
a
goal
it
needs
twelve
years
of
normal
healthful
living
to
effect
even
slight
perceptible
change
in
brain
structure
and
a
million
solar
returns
are
exacted
to
sufficiently
refine
the
cerebral
tenement
for
manifestation
of
cosmic
consciousness
untying
the
cord
of
breath
which
binds
the
soul
to
the
body
kriya
serves
to
prolong
life
and
enlarge
the
consciousness
to
infinity
the
yoga
method
overcomes
the
tug
of
war
between
the
mind
and
the
senses
and
frees
the
devotee
to
reinherit
his
eternal
kingdom
he
knows
his
real
nature
is
bound
neither
by
physical
encasement
nor
by
breath
symbol
of
the
mortal
enslavement
to
air
to
nature
elemental
compulsions
introspection
or
sitting
in
the
silence
is
an
unscientific
way
of
trying
to
force
apart
the
mind
and
senses
tied
together
by
the
life
force
the
contemplative
mind
attempting
its
return
to
divinity
is
constantly
dragged
back
toward
the
senses
by
the
life
currents
kriya
controlling
the
mind
directly
through
the
life
force
is
the
easiest
most
effective
and
most
scientific
avenue
of
approach
to
the
infinite
in
contrast
to
the
slow
uncertain
bullock
cart
theological
path
to
god
kriya
may
justly
be
called
the
airplane
route
the
yogic
science
is
based
on
an
empirical
consideration
of
all
forms
of
concentration
and
meditation
exercises
yoga
enables
the
devotee
to
switch
off
or
on
at
will
life
current
from
the
five
sense
telephones
of
sight
sound
smell
taste
and
touch
attaining
this
power
of
the
yogi
finds
it
simple
to
unite
his
mind
at

with
divine
realms
or
with
the
world
of
matter
no
longer
is
he
unwillingly
brought
back
by
the
life
force
to
the
mundane
sphere
of
rowdy
sensations
and
restless
thoughts
master
of
his
body
and
mind
the
kriya
yogi
ultimately
achieves
victory
over
the
last
enemy
death
so
shalt
thou
feed
on
death
that
feeds
on
men
and
death
once
dead
there
no
more
dying
then
the
life
of
an
advanced
kriya
yogi
is
influenced
not
by
effects
of
past
actions
but
solely
by
directions
from
the
soul
the
devotee
thus
avoids
the
slow
evolutionary
monitors
of
egoistic
actions
good
and
bad
of
common
life
cumbrous
and
to
the
eagle
hearts
the
superior
method

frees
the
yogi
who
shorn
of
his
tastes
the
deep
air
of
omnipresence
the
thralldom
of
natural
living
is
in
contrast
set
in
a
pace
humiliating
conforming
his
life
to
the
evolutionary
order
a
man
can
command
no
concessionary
haste
from
nature
but
living
without
error
against
the
laws
of
his
physical
and
mental
endowment
still
requires
about
a
million

founding
a
yoga
school
at
ranchi
why
are
you
averse
to
organizational
work
master
question
startled
me
a
bit
it
is
true
that
my
private
conviction
at
the
time
was
that
organizations
were
hornets
nests
it
is
a
thankless
task
sir
i
answered
no
matter
what
the
leader
does
or
does
not
he
is
criticized
do
you
want
the
whole
divine
channa
milk
curd
for
yourself
alone
my
guru
retort
was
accompanied
by
a
stern
glance
could
you
or
anyone
else
achieve
through
yoga
if
a
line
of
masters
had
not
been
willing
to
convey
their
knowledge
to
others
he
added
god
is
the
honey
organizations
are
the
hives
both
are
necessary
any
form
is
useless
of
course
without
the
spirit
but
why
should
you
not
start
busy
hives
full
of
the
spiritual
nectar
his
counsel
moved
me
deeply
although
i
made
no
outward
reply
an
adamant
resolution
arose
in
my
breast
i
would
share
with
my
fellows
so
far
as
lay
in
my
power
the
unshackling
truths
i
had
learned
at
my
guru
feet
lord
i
prayed
may
thy
love
shine
forever
on
the
sanctuary
of
my
devotion
and
may
i
be
able
to
awaken
that
love
in
other
hearts
on
a
previous
occasion
before
i
had
joined
the
monastic
order
sri
yukteswar
had
made
a
most
unexpected
remark
how
you
will
miss
the
companionship
of
a
wife
in
your
old
age
he
had
said
do
you
not
agree
that
the
family
man
engaged
in
useful
work
to
maintain
his
wife
and
children
thus
plays
a
rewarding
role
in
god
eyes
sir
i
had
protested
in
alarm
you
know
that
my
desire
in
this
life
is
to
espouse
only
the
cosmic
beloved
master
had
laughed
so
merrily
that
i
understood
his
observation
was
made
merely
as
a
test
of
my
faith
remember
he
had
said
slowly
that
he
who
discards
his
worldly
duties
can
justify
himself
only
by
assuming
some
kind
of
responsibility
toward
a
much
larger
family
the
ideal
of
an
education
for
youth
had
always
been
close
to
my
heart
i
saw
clearly
the
arid
results
of
ordinary
instruction
aimed
only
at
the
development
of
body
and
intellect
moral
and
spiritual
values
without
whose
appreciation
no
man
can
approach
happiness
were
yet
lacking
in
the
formal
curriculum
i
determined
to
found
a
school
where
young
boys
could
develop
to
the
full
stature
of
manhood
my
first
step
in
that
direction
was
made
with
seven
children
at
dihika
a
small
country
site
in
bengal
a
year
later
in
through
the
generosity
of
sir
manindra
chandra
nundy
the
maharaja
of
kasimbazar
i
was
able
to
transfer
my
group
to
ranchi
this
town
in
bihar
about
two
hundred
miles
from
calcutta
is
blessed
with
one
of
the
most
healthful
climates
in
india
the
kasimbazar
palace
at
ranchi
was
transformed
into
the
headquarters
for
the
new
school
which
i
called
brahmacharya
vidyalaya
in
accordance
with
the
educational
ideals
of
the
rishis
their
forest
ashrams
had
been
the
ancient
seats
of
learning
secular
and
divine
for
the
youth
of
india
at
ranchi
i
organized
an
educational
program
for
both
grammar
and
high
school
grades
it
included
agricultural
industrial
commercial
and
academic
subjects
the
students
were
also
taught
yoga
concentration
and
meditation
and
a
unique
system
of
physical
development
yogoda
whose
principles
i
had
discovered
in
realizing
that
man
body
is
like
an
electric
battery
i
reasoned
that
it
could
be
recharged
with
energy
through
the
direct
agency
of
the
human
will
as
no
action
slight
or
large
is
possible
without
willing
man
can
avail
himself
of
his
prime
mover
will
to
renew
his
bodily
tissues
without
burdensome
apparatus
or
mechanical
exercises
i
therefore
taught
the
ranchi
students
my
simple
yogoda
techniques
by
which
the
life
force
centred
in
man
medulla
oblongata
can
be
consciously
and
instantly
recharged
from
the
unlimited
supply
of
cosmic
energy
the
boys
responded
wonderfully
to
this
training
developing
extraordinary
ability
to
shift
the
life
energy
from
one
part
of
the
body
to
another
part
and
to
sit
in
perfect
poise
in
difficult
body
postures
they
performed
feats
of
strength
and
endurance
which
many
powerful
adults
could
not
equal
my
youngest
brother
bishnu
charan
ghosh
joined
the
ranchi
school
he
later
became
a
leading
physical
culturist
in
bengal
he
and
one
of
his
students
traveled
to
europe
and
america
giving
exhibitions
of
strength
and
skill
which
amazed
the
university
savants
including
those
at
columbia
university
in
new
york
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
at
ranchi
applications
for
admission
reached
two
thousand
but
the
school
which
at
that
time
was
solely
residential
could
accommodate
only
about
one
hundred
instruction
for
day
students
was
soon
added
in
the
vidyalaya
i
had
to
play
to
the
little
children
and
to
cope
with
many
organizational
difficulties
i
often
remembered
christ
words
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
is
no
man
that
hath
left
house
or
brethren
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
wife
or

my
sake

sri

interpreted
these
words

him
by
refusing
his

of
a

said
i
am

reconciled
to

it
gives

to
see
you
amidst
these
happy
eager

rather
than
with

lifeless

he
waved
toward
a
group
of
a
dozen
little
ones
who
were
tagging
at
my
heels
i
had
only
eight
children
he
observed
with
twinkling
eyes
but
i
can
feel
for
you
with
a
large
fruit
orchard
and
fertile
acres
at
our
disposal
the
students
teachers
and
myself
enjoyed
many
happy
hours
of
outdoor
labor
in
these
ideal
surroundings
we
had
many
pets
including
a
young
deer
who
was
fairly
idolized
by
the
children
i
too
loved
the
fawn
so
much
that
i
allowed
it
to
sleep
in
my
room
at
the
light
of
dawn
the
little
creature
would
toddle
over
to
my
bed
for
a
morning
caress
one
day
i
fed
the
pet
earlier
than
usual
as
i
had
to
attend
to
some
business
in
the
town
of
ranchi
although
i
cautioned
the
boys
not
to
feed
the
fawn
until
my
return
one
of
them
was
disobedient
and
gave
the
baby
deer
a
large
quantity
of
milk
when
i
came
back
in
the
evening
sad
news
greeted
me
the
little
fawn
is
nearly
dead
through
over
feeding
in
tears
i
placed
the
apparently
lifeless
pet
on
my
lap
i
prayed
piteously
to
god
to
spare
its
life
hours
later
the
small
creature
opened
its
eyes
stood
up
and
walked
feebly
the
whole
school
shouted
for
joy
but
a
deep
lesson
came
to
me
that
night
one
i
can
never
forget
i
stayed
up
with
the
fawn
until
two
when
i
fell
asleep
the
deer
appeared
in
a
dream
and
spoke
to
me
you
are
holding
me
back
please
let
me
go
let
me
go
all
right
i
answered
in
the
dream
i
awoke
immediately
and
cried
out
boys
the
deer
is
dying
the
children
rushed
to
my
side
i
ran
to
the
corner
of
the
room
where
i
had
placed
the
pet
it
made
a
last
effort
to
rise
stumbled
toward
me
then
dropped
at
my
feet
dead
according
to
the
mass
karma
which
guides
and
regulates
the
destinies
of
animals
the
deer
life
was
over
and
it
was
ready
to
progress
to
a
higher
form
but
by
my
deep
attachment
which
i
later
realized
was
selfish
and
by
my
fervent
prayers
i
had
been
able
to
hold
it
in
the
limitations
of
the
animal
form
from
which
the
soul
was
struggling
for
release
the
soul
of
the
deer
made
its
plea
in
a
dream
because
without
my
loving
permission
it
either
would
not
or
could
not
go
as
soon
as
i
agreed
it
departed
all
sorrow
left
me
i
realized
anew
that
god
wants
his
children
to
love
everything
as
a
part
of
him
and
not
to
feel
delusively
that
death
ends
all
the
ignorant
man
sees
only
the
unsurmountable
wall
of
death
hiding
seemingly
forever
his
cherished
friends
but
the
man
of
unattachment
he
who
loves
others
as
expressions
of
the
lord
understands
that
at
death
the
dear
ones
have
only
returned
for
a
of
joy
in
him

the

activities
has
been
honored
by
visits
of
eminent
men
from
the
east
and
the
west
one
of
the
earliest
great
figures
to
inspect
the
vidyalaya
in
its
first
year
was
swami
pranabananda
the
benares
saint
with
two
bodies
as
the
great
master
viewed
the
picturesque
outdoor
classes
held
under
the
trees
and
saw
in
the
evening
that
young
boys
were
sitting
motionless
for
hours
in
yoga
meditation
he
was
profoundly
moved
joy
comes
to
my
heart
he
said
to
see
that
lahiri
ideals
for
the
proper
training
of
youth
are
being
carried
on
in
this
institution
my
guru
blessings
be
on
it
a
young
lad
sitting
by
my
side
ventured
to
ask
the
great
yogi
a
question
sir
he
said
shall
i
be
a
monk
is
my
life
only
for
god
though
swami
pranabananda
smiled
gently
his
eyes
were
piercing
the
future
child
he
replied
when
you
grow
up
there
is
a
beautiful
bride
waiting
for
you
the
boy
did
eventually
marry
after
having
planned
for
years
to
enter
the
swami
order
sometime
after
swami
pranabananda
had
visited
ranchi
i
accompanied
my
father
to
the
calcutta
house
where
the
yogi
was
temporarily
staying
pranabananda
prediction
made
to
me
so
many
years
before
came
rushing
to
my
mind
i
shall
see
you
with
your
father
later
on
as
father
entered
the
swami
room
the
great
yogi
rose
from
his
seat
and
embraced
my
parent
with
loving
respect
bhagabati
he
said
what
are
you
doing
about
yourself
do
you
see
your
son
racing
to
the
infinite
i
blushed
to
hear
his
praise
before
my
father
the
swami
went
on
you
recall
how
often
our
blessed
guru
used
to
say
banat
ban
jai
so
keep
up
kriya
yoga
ceaselessly
and
reach
the
divine
portals
quickly
the
body
of
pranabananda
which
had
appeared
so
well
and
strong
during
my
amazing
first
visit
to
him
in
benares
now
showed
definite
aging
though
his
posture
was
still
admirably
erect
swamiji
i
inquired
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
please
tell
me
the
truth
are
you
feeling
the
advance
of
age
as
the
body
is
weakening
are
your
perceptions
of
god
suffering
any
diminution
he
smiled
angelically
the
beloved
is
more
than
ever
with
me
now
his
complete
conviction
overwhelmed
my
mind
and
soul
he
went
on
i
am
still
enjoying
the
two
from
bhagabati
here
and
one
from
above
pointing
his
finger
heavenward
the
saint
fell
into
an
ecstasy
his
face
lit
with
a
divine
ample
answer
to
my
question
noticing
that
pranabananda
room
contained
many
plants
and
packages
of
seed
i
asked
their
purpose
i
have
left
benares
permanently
he
said
and
am
now
on
my
way
to
the
himalayas
there
i
shall
open
an
ashram
for
my
disciples
these
seeds
will
produce
spinach
and
a
few
other
vegetables
my
dear
ones
will
live
simply
spending
their
time
in
blissful
nothing
else
is
necessary
father
asked
his
brother
disciple
when
he
would
return
to
calcutta
never
again
the
saint
replied
this
year
is
the
one
in
which
lahiri
mahasaya
told
me
i
would
leave
my
beloved
benares
forever
and
go
to
the
himalayas
there
to
throw
off
my
mortal
frame
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
his
words
but
the
swami
smiled
tranquilly
he
reminded
me
of
a
little
heavenly
child
sitting
securely
on
the
lap
of
the
divine
mother
the
burden
of
the
years
has
no
ill
effect
on
a
great
yogi
full
possession
of
supreme
spiritual
powers
he
is
able
to
renew
his
body
at
will
yet
sometimes
he
does
not
care
to
retard
the
aging
process
but
allows
his
karma
to
work
itself
out
on
the
physical
plane
using
his
old
body
as
a
device
to
exclude
the
necessity
of
working
out
karma
in
a
new
incarnation
months
later
i
met
an
old
friend
sanandan
who
was
one
of
pranabananda
close
disciples
my
adorable
guru
is
gone
he
told
me
amidst
sobs
he
established
a
hermitage
near
rishikesh
and
gave
us
loving
training
when
we
were
pretty
well
settled
and
making
rapid
spiritual
progress
in
his
company
he
proposed
one
day
to
feed
a
huge
crowd
from
rishikesh
i
inquired
why
he
wanted
such
a
large
number
is
my
last
festival
ceremony
he
said
i
did
not
understand
the
full
implications
of
his
words
pranabanandaji
helped
with
the
cooking
of
great
amounts
of
food
we
fed
about
guests
after
the
feast
he
sat
on
a
high
platform
and
gave
an
inspired
sermon
on
the
infinite
at
the
end
before
the
gaze
of
thousands
he
turned
to
me
as
i
sat
beside
him
on
the
dais
and
spoke
with
unusual
force
be
prepared
i
am
going
to
kick
the
frame
after
a
stunned
silence
i
cried
loudly
do
do
it
please
please
do
do
it
the
crowd
was
watching
us
curiously
my
guru
smiled
at
me
but
his
solemn
gaze
was
already
fixed
on
eternity
not
selfish
he
said
grieve
for
me
i
have
been
long
cheerfully
serving
you
all
now
rejoice
and
wish
me
godspeed
i
go
to
meet
my
cosmic
beloved
in
a
whisper
pranabanandaji
added
shall
be
reborn
shortly
after
enjoying
a
short
period
of
the
infinite
bliss
i
shall
return
to
earth
and
join
babaji
you
shall
soon
know
when
and
where
my
soul
has
been
encased
in
a
new
body
he
cried
again
here
i
kick
the
frame
by
the
second
kriya
yoga
he
looked
at
the
sea
of
faces
before
us
and
gave
a
blessing
directing
his
gaze
inwardly
to
the
spiritual
eye
he
became
immobile
while
the
bewildered
crowd
thought
he
was
meditating
in
an
ecstatic
state
he
had
already
left
the
tabernacle
of
flesh
and
plunged
his
soul
into
the
cosmic
vastness
the
disciples
touched
his
body
seated
in
the
lotus
posture
but
it
was
no
longer
the
warm
flesh
only
a
stiffened
frame
remained
the
tenant
had
fled
to
the
immortal
shore
i
inquired
where
pranabananda
was
to
be
reborn
that
a
sacred
trust
i
can
not
divulge
to
anyone
sanandan
replied
perhaps
you
may
find
out
some
other
way
years
later
i
discovered
from
swami
keshabananda
that
pranabananda
a
few
years
after
his
birth
in
a
new
body
had
gone
to
badrinarayan
in
the
himalayas
and
there
joined
the
group
of
saints
around
the
great
babaji

kashi
reborn
and

please
do
not
go
into
the
water
let
us
bathe
by
dipping
our
buckets
i
was
addressing
the
young
ranchi
students
who
were
accompanying
me
on
an
hike
to
a
neighboring
hill
the
pond
before
us
was
inviting
but
a
distaste
for
it
had
arisen
in
my
mind
the
group
around
me
followed
my
example
of
dipping
buckets
but
a
few
lads
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
the
cool
waters
no
sooner
had
they
dived
than
large
water
snakes
wiggled
around
them
the
boys
came
out
of
the
pond
with
comical
alacrity
we
enjoyed
a
picnic
lunch
after
we
reached
our
destination
i
sat
under
a
tree
surrounded
by
a
group
of
students
finding
me
in
an
inspirational
mood
they
plied
me
with
questions
please
tell
me
sir
one
youth
inquired
if
i
shall
always
stay
with
you
in
the
path
of
renunciation
ah
no
i
replied
you
will
be
forcibly
taken
away
to
your
home
and
later
you
will
marry
incredulous
he
made
a
vehement
protest
only
if
i
am
dead
can
i
be
carried
home
but
in
a
few
months
his
parents
arrived
to
take
him
away
in
spite
of
his
tearful
resistance
some
years
later
he
did
marry
after
answering
many
questions
i
was
addressed
by
a
lad
named
kashi
he
was
about
twelve
years
old
a
brilliant
student
and
beloved
by
all
sir
he
said
what
will
be
my
fate
you
shall
soon
be
dead
the
reply
came
from
my
lips
with
an
irresistible
force
this
unexpected
disclosure
shocked
and
grieved
me
as
well
as
everyone
present
silently
rebuking
myself
as
an
enfant
terrible
i
refused
to
answer
further
questions
on
our
return
to
the
school
kashi
came
to
my
room
if
i
die
will
you
find
me
when
i
am
reborn
and
bring
me
again
to
the
spiritual
path
he
sobbed
i
felt
constrained
to
refuse
this
difficult
occult
responsibility
but
for
weeks
afterward
kashi
pressed
me
doggedly
seeing
him
unnerved
to
the
breaking
point
i
finally
consoled
him
yes
i
promised
if
the
heavenly
father
lends
his
aid
i
will
try
to
find
you
during
the
summer
vacation
i
started
on
a
short
trip
regretting
that
i
could
not
take
kashi
with
me
i
called
him
to
my
room
before
leaving
and
carefully
instructed
him
to
remain
against
all
persuasion
in
the
spiritual
vibrations
of
the
school
somehow
i
felt
that
if
he
did
not
go
home
he
might
avoid
the
impending
calamity
no
sooner
had
i
left
than
kashi
father
arrived
in
ranchi
for
fifteen
days
he
tried
to
break
the
will
of
his
son
explaining
that
if
kashi
would
go
to
calcutta
for
only
four
days
to
see
his
mother
he
could
then
return
kashi
persistently
refused
the
father
finally
said
he
would
take
the
boy
away
with
the
help
of
the
police
the
threat
disturbed
kashi
who
was
unwilling
to
be
the
cause
of
any
unfavorable
publicity
to
the
school
he
saw
no
choice
but
to
go
i
returned
to
ranchi
a
few
days
later
when
i
heard
how
kashi
had
been
removed
i
entrained
at
once
for
calcutta
there
i
engaged
a
horse
cab
very
strangely
as
the
vehicle
passed
beyond
the
howrah
bridge
over
the
ganges
i
beheld
kashi
father
and
other
relatives
in
mourning
clothes
shouting
to
my
driver
to
stop
i
rushed
out
and
glared
at
the
unfortunate
father
murderer
i
cried
somewhat
unreasonably
you
have
killed
my
boy
the
father
had
already
realized
the
wrong
he
had
done
in
forcibly
bringing
kashi
to
calcutta
during
the
few
days
the
boy
had
been
there
he
had
eaten
contaminated
food
contracted
cholera
and
passed
on
my
love
for
kashi
and
the
pledge
to
find
him
after
death
night
and
day
haunted
me
no
matter
where
i
went
his
face
loomed
up
before
me
i
began
a
memorable
search
for
him
even
as
long
ago
i
had
searched
for
my
lost
mother

see
i
felt
that
inasmuch
as
god
had
given
me
the
faculty
of
reason
i
must
utilize
it
and
tax
my
powers
to
the
utmost
in
order
to
discover
the
subtle
laws
by
which
i
could
know
the
boy
astral
whereabouts
he
was
a
soul
vibrating
with
unfulfilled
desires
i
mass
of
light
floating
somewhere
amidst
millions
of
luminous
souls
in
the
astral
regions
how
was
i
to
tune
in
with
him
among
so
many
vibrating
lights
of
other
souls
using
a
secret
yoga
technique
i
broadcasted
my
love
to
soul
through
the
microphone
of
the
spiritual
eye
the
inner
point
between
the
eyebrows
with
the
antenna
of
upraised
hands
and
fingers
i
often
turned
myself
round
and
round
trying
to
locate
the
direction
in
which
he
had
been
reborn
as
an
embryo
i
hoped
to
receive
response
from
him
in
the
radio
of
my
heart
i
intuitively
felt
that
kashi
would
soon
return
to
the
earth
and
that
if
i
kept
unceasingly
broadcasting
my
call
to
him
his
soul
would
reply
i
knew
that
the
slightest
impulse
sent
by
kashi
would
be
felt
in
my
fingers
hands
arms
spine
and
nerves
with
undiminished
zeal
i
practiced
the
yoga
method
steadily
for
about
six
months
after
kashi
death
walking
with
a
few
friends
one
morning
in
the
crowded
bowbazar
section
of
calcutta
i
lifted
my
hands
in
the
usual
manner
for
the
first
time
there
was
response
i
thrilled
to
detect
electrical
impulses
trickling
down
my
fingers
and
palms
these
currents
translated
themselves
into
one
overpowering
thought
from
a
deep
recess
of
my
consciousness
i
am
kashi
i
am
kashi
come
to
me
the
thought
became
almost
audible
as
i
concentrated
on
my
heart
radio
in
the
characteristic
slightly
hoarse
whisper
of
kashi
i
heard
his
summons
again
and
again
i
seized
the
arm
of
one
of
my
companions
prokash
das
and
smiled
at
him
joyfully
it
looks
as
though
i
have
located
kashi
i
began
to
turn
round
and
round
to
the
undisguised
amusement
of
my
friends
and
the
passing
throng
the
electrical
impulses
tingled
through
my
fingers
only
when
i
faced
toward
a
path
aptly
named
serpentine
lane
the
astral
currents
disappeared
when
i
turned
in
other
directions
ah
i
exclaimed
kashi
soul
must
be
living
in
the
womb
of
some
mother
whose
home
is
in
this
lane
my
companions
and
i
approached
closer
to
serpentine
lane
the
vibrations
in
my
upraised
hands
grew
stronger
more
pronounced
as
if
by
a
magnet
i
was
pulled
toward
the
right
side
of
the
road
reaching
the
entrance
of
a
certain
house
i
was
astounded
to
find
myself
transfixed
i
knocked
at
the
door
in
a
state
of
intense
excitement
holding
my
very
breath
i
felt
that
the
successful
end
had
come
for
my
long
arduous
and
certainly
unusual
quest
the
door
was
opened
by
a
servant
who
told
me
her
master
was
at
home
he
descended
the
stairway
from
the
second
floor
and
smiled
at
me
inquiringly
i
hardly
knew
how
to
frame
my
question
at
once
pertinent
and
impertinent
please
tell
me
sir
if
you
and
your
wife
have
been
expecting
a
child
for
about
six
months
yes
it
is
so
seeing
that
i
was
a
swami
a
renunciate
attired
in
the
traditional
orange
cloth
he
added
politely
pray
inform
me
how
you
know
my
affairs
when
he
heard
about
kashi
and
the
promise
i
had
given
the
astonished
man
believed
my
story
a
male
child
of
fair
complexion
will
be
born
to
you
i
told
him
he
will
have
a
broad
face
with
a
cowlick
atop
his
forehead
his
disposition
will
be
notably
spiritual
i
felt
certain
that
the
coming
child
would
bear
these
resemblances
to
kashi
later
i
visited
the
child
whose
parents
had
given
him
his
old
name
of
kashi
even
in
infancy
he
was
strikingly
similar
in
appearance
to
my
dear
ranchi
student
the
child
showed
me
an
instantaneous
affection
the
attraction
of
the
past
awoke
with
redoubled
intensity
years
later
the
boy
wrote
me
during
my
stay
in
america
he
explained
his
deep
longing
to
follow
the
path
of
a
renunciate
i
directed
him
to
a
himalayan
master
who
to
this
day
guides
the
reborn
kashi
the
will
projected
from
the
point
between
the
eyebrows
is
known
by
yogis
as
the
broadcasting
apparatus
of
thought
when
the
feeling
is
calmly
concentrated
on
the
heart
it
acts
as
a
mental
radio
and
can
receive
the
messages
of
others
from
far
or
near
in
telepathy
the
fine
vibrations
of
thoughts
in
one
person
mind
are
transmitted
through
the
subtle
vibrations
of
astral
ether
and
then
through
the
grosser
earthly
ether
creating
electrical
waves
which
in
turn
translate
themselves
into
thought
waves
in
the
mind
of
the
other
person
every
soul
in
its
pure
state
is
omniscient
kashi
soul
remembered
all
the
characteristics
of
kashi
the
boy
and
therefore
mimicked
his
hoarse
voice
in
order
to
stir
my
recognition

to

form

like

bhola
nath
a
bright
lad
at
my
ranchi
school
gave
me
this
explanation
after
i
had
complimented
him
one
morning
on
his
melodious
outbursts
with
or
without
provocation
the
boy
poured
forth
a
tuneful
stream
he
had
previously
attended
the
famous
tagore
school
of
santiniketan
haven
of
peace
at
bolpur
the
songs
of
rabindranath
have
been
on
my
lips
since
early
youth
i
told
my
companion
all
bengal
even
the
unlettered
peasants
delights
in
his
lofty
verse
bhola
and
i
sang
together
a
few
refrains
from
tagore
who
has
set
to
music
thousands
of
indian
poems
some
original
and
others
of
hoary
antiquity
i
met
rabindranath
soon
after
he
had
received
the
nobel
prize
for
literature
i
remarked
after
our
vocalizing
i
was
drawn
to
visit
him
because
i
admired
his
undiplomatic
courage
in
disposing
of
his
literary
critics
i
chuckled
bhola
curiously
inquired
the
story
the
scholars
severely
flayed
tagore
for
introducing
a
new
style
into
bengali
poetry
i
began
he
mixed
colloquial
and
classical
expressions
ignoring
all
the
prescribed
limitations
dear
to
the
pundits
hearts
his
songs
embody
deep
philosophic
truth
in
emotionally
appealing
terms
with
little
regard
for
the
accepted
literary
forms
one
influential
critic
slightingly
referred
to
rabindranath
as
a
who
sold
his
cooings
in
print
for
a
rupee
but
tagore
revenge
was
at
hand
the
whole
western
world
paid
homage
at
his
feet
soon
after
he
had
translated
into
english
his
gitanjali
offerings
a
trainload
of
pundits
including
his
critics
went
to
santiniketan
to
offer
their
congratulations
rabindranath
received
his
guests
only
after
an
intentionally
long
delay
and
then
heard
their
praise
in
stoic
silence
finally
he
turned
against
them
their
own
habitual
weapons
of
criticism
he
said
fragrant
honors
you
here
bestow
are
incongruously
mingled
with
the
putrid
odors
of
your
past
contempt
is
there
possibly
any
connection
between
my
award
of
the
nobel
prize
and
your
suddenly
acute
powers
of
appreciation
i
am
still
the
same
poet
who
displeased
you
when
i
first
offered
my
humble
flowers
at
the
shrine
of
bengal
the
newspapers
published
an
account
of
the
bold
chastisement
given
by
tagore
i
admired
the
outspoken
words
of
a
man
unhypnotized
by
flattery
i
went
on
i
was
introduced
to
rabindranath
in
calcutta
by
his
secretary
andrews
who
was
simply
attired
in
a
bengali
dhoti
he
referred
lovingly
to
tagore
as
his
gurudeva
rabindranath
received
me
graciously
he
emanated
a
soothing
aura
of
charm
culture
and
courtliness
replying
to
my
question
about
his
literary
background
tagore
told
me
that
one
ancient
source
of
his
inspiration
besides
our
religious
epics
had
been
the
classical
poet
bidyapati
inspired
by
these
memories
i
began
to
sing
tagore
version
of
an
old
bengali
song
light
the
lamp
of
thy
love
bhola
and
i
chanted
joyously
as
we
strolled
over
the
vidyalaya
grounds
about
two
years
after
founding
the
ranchi
school
i
received
an
invitation
from
rabindranath
to
visit
him
at
santiniketan
in
order
to
discuss
our
educational
ideals
i
went
gladly
the
poet
was
seated
in
his
study
when
i
entered
i
thought
then
as
at
our
first
meeting
that
he
was
as
striking
a
model
of
superb
manhood
as
any
painter
could
desire
his
beautifully
chiseled
face
nobly
patrician
was
framed
in
long
hair
and
flowing
beard
large
melting
eyes
an
angelic
smile
and
a
voice
of
flutelike
quality
which
was
literally
enchanting
stalwart
tall
and
grave
he
combined
an
almost
womanly
tenderness
with
the
delightful
spontaneity
of
a
child
no
idealized
conception
of
a
poet
could
find
more
suitable
embodiment
than
in
this
gentle
singer
tagore
and
i
were
soon
deep
in
a
comparative
study
of
our
schools
both
founded
along
unorthodox
lines
we
discovered
many
identical
instruction
simplicity
ample
scope
for
the
child
creative
spirit
rabindranath
however
laid
considerable
stress
on
the
study
of
literature
and
poetry
and
the
through
music
and
song
which
i
had
already
noted
in
the
case
of
bhola
the
santiniketan
children
observed
periods
of
silence
but
were
given
no
special
yoga
training
the
poet
listened
with
flattering
attention
to
my
description
of
the
energizing
yogoda
exercises
and
the
yoga
concentration
techniques
which
are
taught
to
all
students
at
ranchi
tagore
told
me
of
his
own
early
educational
struggles
i
fled
from
school
after
the
fifth
grade
he
said
laughing
i
could
readily
understand
how
his
innate
poetic
delicacy
had
been
affronted
by
the
dreary
disciplinary
atmosphere
of
a
schoolroom
that
is
why
i
opened
santiniketan
under
the
shady
trees
and
the
glories
of
the
sky
he
motioned
eloquently
to
a
little
group
studying
in
the
beautiful
garden
a
child
is
in
his
natural
setting
amidst
the
flowers
and
songbirds
only
thus
may
he
fully
express
the
hidden
wealth
of
his
individual
endowment
true
education
can
never
be
crammed
and
pumped
from
without
rather
it
must
aid
in
bringing
spontaneously
to
the
surface
the
infinite
hoards
of
wisdom
within
i
agreed
the
idealistic
and
instincts
of
the
young
are
starved
on
an
exclusive
diet
of
statistics
and
chronological
eras
the
poet
spoke
lovingly
of
his
father
devendranath
who
had
inspired
the
santiniketan
beginnings
father
presented
me
with
this
fertile
land
where
he
had
already
built
a
guest
house
and
temple
rabindranath
told
me
i
started
my
educational
experiment
here
in
with
only
ten
boys
the
eight
thousand
pounds
which
came
with
the
nobel
prize
all
went
for
the
upkeep
of
the
school
the
elder
tagore
devendranath
known
far
and
wide
as
maharishi
was
a
very
remarkable
man
as
one
may
discover
from
his
autobiography
two
years
of
his
manhood
were
spent
in
meditation
in
the
himalayas
in
turn
his
father
dwarkanath
tagore
had
been
celebrated
throughout
bengal
for
his
munificent
public
benefactions
from
this
illustrious
tree
has
sprung
a
family
of
geniuses
not
rabindranath
alone
all
his
relatives
have
distinguished
themselves
in
creative
expression
his
brothers
gogonendra
and
abanindra
are
among
the
foremost
artists
of
india
another
brother
dwijendra
is
a
philosopher
at
whose
gentle
call
the
birds
and
woodland
creatures
respond
rabindranath
invited
me
to
stay
overnight
in
the
guest
house
it
was
indeed
a
charming
spectacle
in
the
evening
to
see
the
poet
seated
with
a
group
in
the
patio
time
unfolded
backward
the
scene
before
me
was
like
that
of
an
ancient
joyous
singer
encircled
by
his
devotees
all
aureoled
in
divine
love
tagore
knitted
each
tie
with
the
cords
of
harmony
never
assertive
he
drew
and
captured
the
heart
by
an
irresistible
magnetism
rare
blossom
of
poesy
blooming
in
the
garden
of
the
lord
attracting
others
by
a
natural
fragrance
in
his
melodious
voice
rabindranath
read
to
us
a
few
of
his
exquisite
poems
newly
created
most
of
his
songs
and
plays
written
for
the
delectation
of
his
students
have
been
composed
at
santiniketan
the
beauty
of
his
lines
to
me
lies
in
his
art
of
referring
to
god
in
nearly
every
stanza
yet
seldom
mentioning
the
sacred
name
drunk
with
the
bliss
of
singing
he
wrote
i
forget
myself
and
call
thee
friend
who
art
my
lord
the
following
day
after
lunch
i
bade
the
poet
a
reluctant
farewell
i
rejoice
that
his
little
school
has
now
grown
to
an
international
university
where
scholars
of
all
lands
have
found
an
ideal
setting
where
the
mind
is
without
fear
and
the
head
is
held
high
where
knowledge
is
free
where
the
world
has
not
been
broken
up
into
fragments
by
narrow
domestic
walls
where
words
come
out
from
the
depth
of
truth
where
tireless
striving
stretches
its
arms
toward
perfection
where
the
clear
stream
of
reason
has
not
lost
its
way
into
the
dreary
desert
sand
of
dead
habit
where
the
mind
is
led
forward
by
thee
into
thought
and
action
into
that
heaven
of
freedom

the
great
novelist
leo
tolstoy
wrote
a
delightful
story
the
three
hermits
his
friend
nicholas
roerich
has
summarized
the
tale
as
follows
on
an
island
there
lived
three
old
hermits
they
were
so
simple
that
the
only
prayer
they
used
was
are
three
thou
art
mercy
on
us
great
miracles
were
manifested
during
this
naive
prayer
the
local
bishop
came
to
hear
about
the
three
hermits
and
their
inadmissible
prayer
and
decided
to
visit
them
in
order
to
teach
them
the
canonical
invocations
he
arrived
on
the
island
told
the
hermits
that
their
heavenly
petition
was
undignified
and
taught
them
many
of
the
customary
prayers
the
bishop
then
left
on
a
boat
he
saw
following
the
ship
a
radiant
light
as
it
approached
he
discerned
the
three
hermits
who
were
holding
hands
and
running
upon
the
waves
in
an
effort
to
overtake
the
vessel
have
forgotten
the
prayers
you
taught
us
they
cried
as
they
reached
the
bishop
have
hastened
to
ask
you
to
repeat
them
the
awed
bishop
shook
his
head
ones
he
replied
humbly
to
live
with
your
old
prayer
how
did
the
three
saints
walk
on
the
water
how
did
christ
resurrect
his
crucified
body
how
did
lahiri
mahasaya
and
sri
yukteswar
perform
their
miracles
modern
science
has
as
yet
no
answer
though
with
the
advent
of
the
atomic
bomb
and
the
wonders
of
radar
the
scope
of
the
has
been
abruptly
enlarged
the
word
impossible
is
becoming
less
prominent
in
the
scientific
vocabulary
the
ancient
vedic
scriptures
declare
that
the
physical
world
operates
under
one
fundamental
law
of
maya
the
principle
of
relativity
and
duality
god
the
sole
life
is
an
absolute
unity
he
can
not
appear
as
the
separate
and
diverse
manifestations
of
a
creation
except
under
a
false
or
unreal
veil
that
cosmic
illusion
is
maya
every
great
scientific
discovery
of
modern
times
has
served
as
a
confirmation
of
this
simple
pronouncement
of
the
rishis
newton
law
of
motion
is
a
law
of
maya
to
every
action
there
is
always
an
equal
and
contrary
reaction
the
mutual
actions
of
any
two
bodies
are
always
equal
and
oppositely
directed
action
and
reaction
are
thus
exactly
equal
to
have
a
single
force
is
impossible
there
must
be
and
always
is
a
pair
of
forces
equal
and
opposite
fundamental
natural
activities
all
betray
their
mayic
origin
electricity
for
example
is
a
phenomenon
of
repulsion
and
attraction
its
electrons
and
protons
are
electrical
opposites
another
example
the
atom
or
final
particle
of
matter
is
like
the
earth
itself
a
magnet
with
positive
and
negative
poles
the
entire
phenomenal
world
is
under
the
inexorable
sway
of
polarity
no
law
of
physics
chemistry
or
any
other
science
is
ever
found
free
from
inherent
opposite
or
contrasted
principles
physical
science
then
can
not
formulate
laws
outside
of
maya
the
very
texture
and
structure
of
creation
nature
herself
is
maya
natural
science
must
perforce
deal
with
her
ineluctable
quiddity
in
her
own
domain
she
is
eternal
and
inexhaustible
future
scientists
can
do
no
more
than
probe
one
aspect
after
another
of
her
varied
infinitude
science
thus
remains
in
a
perpetual
flux
unable
to
reach
finality
fit
indeed
to
formulate
the
laws
of
an
already
existing
and
functioning
cosmos
but
powerless
to
detect
the
law
framer
and
sole
operator
the
majestic
manifestations
of
gravitation
and
electricity
have
become
known
but

gravitation
and

are

he
begins
to
cast
a
hopeful
eye
beyond
the
compulsions
of

that
atomic

one
of

in

rests
on

as
the
shadow
ink
flows
over
the
shadow
paper
it
is
all
symbolic
and
as
a
symbol
the
physicist
leaves
it
then
comes
the
alchemist
mind
who
transmutes
the
symbols
to
put
the
conclusion
crudely
the
stuff
of
the
world
is
the
realistic
matter
and
fields
of

of
former
physical
theory
are
altogether
irrelevant
except
in
so
far
as
the
has
itself
spun
these
imaginings
the
external
world
has
thus
become
a
world
of
shadows
in
removing
our
illusions
we
have
removed
the
substance
for
indeed
we
have
seen
that
substance
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
our
illusions
with
the
recent
discovery
of
the
electron
microscope
came
definite
proof
of
the
of
atoms
and
of
the
inescapable
duality
of
nature
the
new
york
times
gave
the
following
report
of
a
demonstration
of
the
electron
microscope
before
a
meeting
of
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
the
crystalline
structure
of
tungsten
hitherto
known
only
indirectly
by
means
of
stood
outlined
boldly
on
a
fluorescent
screen
showing
nine
atoms
in
their
correct
positions
in
the
space
lattice
a
cube
with
one
atom
in
each
corner
and
one
in
the
center
the
atoms
in
the
crystal
lattice
of
the
tungsten
appeared
on
the
fluorescent
screen
as
points
of
light
arranged
in
geometric
pattern
against
this
crystal
cube
of
light
the
bombarding
molecules
of
air
could
be
observed
as
dancing
points
of
light
similar
to
points
of
sunlight
shimmering
on
moving
waters
the
principle
of
the
electron
microscope
was
first
discovered
in
by
drs
clinton
davisson
and
lester
germer
of
the
bell
telephone
laboratories
new
york
city
who
found
that
the
electron
had
a
dual
personality
partaking
of
the
characteristic
of
both
a
particle
and
a
wave
the
wave
quality
gave
the
electron
the
characteristic
of
light
and
a
search
was
begun
to
devise
means
for
electrons
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
focusing
of
light
by
means
of
a
lens
for
his
discovery
of
the
quality
of
the
electron
which
corroborated
the
prediction
made
in
by
de
broglie
french
nobel
prize
winning
physicist
and
showed
that
the
entire
realm
of
physical
nature
had
a
dual
personality
davisson
also
received
the
nobel
prize
in
physics
the
stream
of
knowledge
sir
james
jeans
writes
in
the
mysterious
universe
is
heading
towards
a
reality
the
universe
begins
to
look
more
like
a
great
thought
than
like
a
great
machine
science
is
thus
sounding
like
a
page
from
the
hoary
vedas
from
science
then
if
it
must
be
so
let
man
learn
the
philosophic
truth
that
there
is
no
material
universe
its
warp
and
woof
is
maya
illusion
its
mirages
of
reality
all
break
down
under
analysis
as
one
by
one
the
reassuring
props
of
a
physical
cosmos
crash
beneath
him
man
dimly
perceives
his
idolatrous
reliance
his
past
transgression
of
the
divine
command
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
me
in
his
famous
equation
outlining
the
equivalence
of
mass
and
energy
einstein
proved
that
the
energy
in
any
particle
of
matter
is
equal
to
its
mass
or
weight
multiplied
by
the
square
of
the
velocity
of
light
the
release
of
the
atomic
energies
is
brought
about
through
the
annihilation
of
the
material
particles
the
death
of
matter
has
been
the
birth
of
an
atomic
age
is
a
mathematical
standard
or
constant
not
because
there
is
an
absolute
value
in
miles
a
second
but
because
no
material
body
whose
mass
increases
with
its
velocity
can
ever
attain
the
velocity
of
light
stated
another
way
only
a
material
body
whose
mass
is
infinite
could
equal
the
velocity
of
light
this
conception
brings
us
to
the
law
of
miracles
the
masters
who
are
able
to
materialize
and
dematerialize
their
bodies
or
any
other
object
and
to
move
with
the
velocity
of
light
and
to
utilize
the
creative
in
bringing
into
instant
visibility
any
physical
manifestation
have
fulfilled
the
necessary
einsteinian
condition
their
mass
is
infinite
the
consciousness
of
a
perfected
yogi
is
effortlessly
identified
not
with
a
narrow
body
but
with
the
universal
structure
gravitation
whether
the
force
of
newton
or
the
einsteinian
manifestation
of
inertia
is
powerless
to
compel
a
master
to
exhibit
the
property
of
weight
which
is
the
distinguishing
gravitational
condition
of
all
material
objects
he
who
knows
himself
as
the
omnipresent
spirit
is
subject
no
longer
to
the
rigidities
of
a
body
in
time
and
space
their
imprisoning
have
yielded
to
the
solvent
i
am
he
fiat
lux
and
there
was
light
god
first
command
to
his
ordered
creation
genesis
brought
into
being
the
only
atomic
reality
light
on
the
beams
of
this
immaterial
medium
occur
all
divine
manifestations
devotees
of
every
age
testify
to
the
appearance
of
god
as
flame
and
light
the
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
who
only
hath
immortality
dwelling
in
the
light
which
no
man
can
approach
unto
a
yogi
who
through
perfect
meditation
has
merged
his
consciousness
with
the
creator
perceives
the
cosmical
essence
as
light
to
him
there
is
no
difference
between
the
light
rays
composing
water
and
the
light
rays
composing
land
free
from
free
from
the
three
dimensions
of

and
the
fourth

of
time
a
master
transfers
his
body
of
light
with
equal
ease
over
the
light
rays
of
earth
water
fire
or
air
long
concentration
on
the
liberating
spiritual
eye
has
enabled
the
yogi
to
destroy
all
delusions
concerning
matter
and
its
gravitational
weight
thenceforth
he
sees
the
universe
as
an
essentially
undifferentiated
mass
of
light
optical
images
troland
of
harvard
tells
us
are
built
up
on
the
same
principle
as
the
ordinary
engravings
that
is
they
are
made
up
of
minute
dottings
or
stripplings
far
too
small
to
be
detected
by
the
eye
the
sensitiveness
of
the
retina
is
so
great
that
a
visual
sensation
can
be
produced
by
relatively
few
quanta
of
the
right
kind
of
light
through
a
divine
knowledge
of

phenomena
he
can
instantly
project
into

where
he

egoistic

that
daily
hem
him
round

nightly

lo
there
in
the

stand
the

the
remotest

the
resurrected
scenes
of
his
childhood
with
that
free
and
unconditioned
consciousness
known
to
all
men
in
the
phenomena
of
dreams
the
master
has
forged
a
link
innocent
of
all
personal
motives
and
employing
the
creative
will
bestowed
on
him
by
the
creator
a
yogi
rearranges
the
light
atoms
of
the
universe
to
satisfy
any
sincere
prayer
of
a
devotee
for
this
purpose
were
man
and
creation
made
that
he
should
rise
up
as
master
of
maya
knowing
his
dominion
over
the
cosmos
and
god
said
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
and
let
them
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
and
over
all
the
earth
and
over
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
in
shortly
after
i
had
entered
the
swami
order
i
witnessed
a
vision
of
violent
contrasts
in
it
the
relativity
of
human
consciousness
was
vividly
established
i
clearly
perceived
the
unity
of
the
eternal
light
behind
the
painful
dualities
of
maya
the
vision
descended
on
me
as
i
sat
one
morning
in
my
little
attic
room
in
father
gurpar
road
home
for
months
world
war
i
had
been
raging
in
europe
i
reflected
sadly
on
the
vast
toll
of
death
as
i
closed
my
eyes
in
meditation
my
consciousness
was
suddenly
transferred
to
the
body
of
a
captain
in
command
of
a
battleship
the
thunder
of
guns
split
the
air
as
shots
were
exchanged
between
shore
batteries
and
the
ship
cannons
a
huge
shell
hit
the
powder
magazine
and
tore
my
ship
asunder
i
jumped
into
the
water
together
with
the
few
sailors
who
had
survived
the
explosion
heart
pounding
i
reached
the
shore
safely
but
alas
a
stray
bullet
ended
its
furious
flight
in
my
chest
i
fell
groaning
to
the
ground
my
whole
body
was
paralyzed
yet
i
was
aware
of
possessing
it
as
one
is
conscious
of
a
leg
gone
to
sleep
at
last
the
mysterious
footstep
of
death
has
caught
up
with
me
i
thought
with
a
final
sigh
i
was
about
to
sink
into
unconsciousness
when
lo
i
found
myself
seated
in
the
lotus
posture
in
my
gurpar
road
room
hysterical
tears
poured
forth
as
i
joyfully
stroked
and
pinched
my
regained
body
free
from
any
bullet
hole
in
the
breast
i
rocked
to
and
fro
inhaling
and
exhaling
to
assure
myself
that
i
was
alive
amidst
these
again
i
found
my
consciousness
transferred
to
the
captain
dead
body
by
the
gory
shore
utter
confusion
of
mind
came
upon
me
lord
i
prayed
am
i
dead
or
alive
a
dazzling
play
of
light
filled
the
whole
horizon
a
soft
rumbling
vibration
formed
itself
into
words
what
has
life
or
death
to
do
with
light
in
the
image
of
my
light
i
have
made
you
the
relativities
of
life
and
death
belong
to
the
cosmic
dream
behold
your
dreamless
being
awake
my
child
awake
as
steps
in
man
awakening
the
lord
inspires
scientists
to
discover
at
the
right
time
and
place
the
secrets
of
his
creation
many
modern
discoveries
help
men
to
apprehend
the
cosmos
as
a
varied
expression
of
one
guided
by
divine
intelligence
the
wonders
of
the
motion
picture
of
radio
of
television
of
radar
of
the
electric
eye
of
atomic
energies
are
all
based
on
the
electromagnetic
phenomenon
of
light
the
motion
picture
art
can
portray
any
miracle
from
the
impressive
visual
standpoint
no
marvel
is
barred
to
trick
photography
a
transparent
astral
body
can
be
seen
rising
from
his
gross
physical
form
he
can
walk
on
the
water
resurrect
the
dead
reverse
the
natural
sequence
of

and
play
havoc
with

assembling

which
a
true
master
produces
with
actual
light

the
lifelike
images
of
the
motion

illustrate
many
truths
concerning
creation
the
cosmic
director
has
written
his
own
plays
and
assembled
the
tremendous
casts
for
the
pageant
of
the
centuries
from
the
dark
booth
of
eternity
he
pours
his
creative
beam
through
the
films
of
successive
ages
and
the
pictures
are
thrown
on
the
screen
of
space
just
as
the
images
appear
to
be
real
but
are
only
combinations
of
light
and
shade
so
is
the
universal
variety
a
delusive
seeming
the
planetary
spheres
with
their
countless
forms
of
life
are
naught
but
figures
in
a
cosmic
motion
picture
temporarily
true
to
five
sense
perceptions
as
the
scenes
are
cast
on
the
screen
of
man
consciousness
by
the
infinite
creative
beam
a
cinema
audience
can
look
up
and
see
that
all
screen
images
are
appearing
through
the
instrumentality
of
one
imageless
beam
of
light
the
colorful
universal
drama
is
similarly
issuing
from
the
single
white
light
of
a
cosmic
source
with
inconceivable
ingenuity
god
is
staging
an
entertainment
for
his
human
children
making
them
actors
as
well
as
audience
in
his
planetary
theater
one
day
i
entered
a
motion
picture
house
to
view
a
newsreel
of
the
european
battlefields
world
war
i
was
still
being
waged
in
the
west
the
newsreel
recorded
the
carnage
with
such
realism
that
i
left
the
theater
with
a
troubled
heart
lord
i
prayed
why
dost
thou
permit
such
suffering
to
my
intense
surprise
an
instant
answer
came
in
the
form
of
a
vision
of
the
actual
european
battlefields
the
horror
of
the
struggle
filled
with
the
dead
and
dying
far
surpassed
in
ferocity
any
representation
of
the
newsreel
look
intently
a
gentle
voice
spoke
to
my
inner
consciousness
you
will
see
that
these
scenes
now
being
enacted
in
france
are
nothing
but
a
play
of
chiaroscuro
they
are
the
cosmic
motion
picture
as
real
and
as
unreal
as
the
theater
newsreel
you
have
just
play
within
a
play
my
heart
was
still
not
comforted
the
divine
voice
went
on
creation
is
light
and
shadow
both
else
no
picture
is
possible
the
good
and
evil
of
maya
must
ever
alternate
in
supremacy
if
joy
were
ceaseless
here
in
this
world
would
man
ever
seek
another
without
suffering
he
scarcely
cares
to
recall
that
he
has
forsaken
his
eternal
home
pain
is
a
prod
to
remembrance
the
way
of
escape
is
through
wisdom
the
tragedy
of
death
is
unreal
those
who
shudder
at
it
are
like
an
ignorant
actor
who
dies
of
fright
on
the
stage
when
nothing
more
is
fired
at
him
than
a
blank
cartridge
my
sons
are
the
children
of
light
they
will
not
sleep
forever
in
delusion
although
i
had
read
scriptural
accounts
of
maya
they
had
not
given
me
the
deep
insight
that
came
with
the
personal
visions
and
their
accompanying
words
of
consolation
one
values
are
profoundly
changed
when
he
is
finally
convinced
that
creation
is
only
a
vast
motion
picture
and
that
not
in
it
but
beyond
it
lies
his
own
reality
as
i
finished
writing
this
chapter
i
sat
on
my
bed
in
the
lotus
posture
my
room
was
dimly
lit
by
two
shaded
lamps
lifting
my
gaze
i
noticed
that
the
ceiling
was
dotted
with
small
lights
scintillating
and
quivering
with
a
radiumlike
luster
myriads
of
pencilled
rays
like
sheets
of
rain
gathered
into
a
transparent
shaft
and
poured
silently
upon
me
at
once
my
physical
body
lost
its
grossness
and
became
metamorphosed
into
astral
texture
i
felt
a
floating
sensation
as
barely
touching
the
bed
the
weightless
body
shifted
slightly
and
alternately
to
left
and
right
i
looked
around
the
room
the
furniture
and
walls
were
as
usual
but
the
little
mass
of
light
had
so
multiplied
that
the
ceiling
was
invisible
i
was
this
is
the
cosmic
motion
picture
mechanism
a
voice
spoke
as
though
from
within
the
light
shedding
its
beam
on
the
white
screen
of
your
bed
sheets
it
is
producing
the
picture
of
your
body
behold
your
form
is
nothing
but
light
i
gazed
at
my
arms
and
moved
them
back
and
forth
yet
could
not
feel
their
weight
an
ecstatic
joy
overwhelmed
me
this
cosmic
stem
of
light
blossoming
as
my
body
seemed
a
divine
replica
of
the
light
beams
streaming
out
of
the
projection
booth
in
a
cinema
house
and
manifesting
as
pictures
on
the
screen
for
a
long
time
i
experienced
this
motion
picture
of
my
body
in
the
dimly
lighted
theater
of
my
own
bedroom
despite
the
many
visions
i
have
had
none
was
ever
more
singular
as
my
illusion
of
a
solid
body
was
completely
dissipated
and
my
realization
deepened
that
the
essence
of
all
objects
is
light
i
looked
up
to
the
throbbing
stream
of
lifetrons
and
spoke
entreatingly
divine
light
please
withdraw
this
my
humble
bodily
picture
into
thyself
even
as
elijah
was
drawn
up
to
heaven
by
a
flame
this
prayer
was
evidently
startling
the
beam
disappeared
my
body
resumed
its
normal
weight
and
sank
on
the
bed
the
swarm
of
dazzling
ceiling
lights
flickered
and
vanished
my
time
to
leave
this
earth
had
apparently
not
arrived
besides
i
thought
philosophically
the
prophet
elijah
might
well
be
displeased
at
my
presumption
this
famous
russian
artist
and
philosopher
has
been
living
for
many
years
in
india
near
the
himalayas
from
the
peaks
comes
revelation
he
has
written
in
caves
and
upon
the
summits
lived
the
rishis
over
the
snowy
peaks
of
the
himalayas
burns
a
bright
glow
brighter
than
stars
and
the
fantastic
flashes
of
lightning
the
story
may
have
a
historical
basis
an
editorial
note
informs
us
that
the
bishop
met
the
three
monks
while
he
was
sailing
from
archangel
to
the
slovetsky
monastery
at
the
mouth
of
the
dvina
river
marconi
the
great
inventor
made
the
following
admission
of
scientific
inadequacy
before
the
finalities
the
inability
of
science
to
solve
life
is
absolute
this
fact
would
be
truly
frightening
were
it
not
for
faith
the
mystery
of
life
is
certainly
the
most
persistent
problem
ever
placed
before
the
thought
of
man
a
clue
to
the
direction
taken
by
einstein
genius
is
given
by
the
fact
that
he
is
a
lifelong
disciple
of
the
great

in
infancy
by
your
he
was
the
guru
of
my
parents
and
of
my
own
guru
sri
yukteswarji
will
you
therefore
give
me
the
privilege
of
hearing
a
few
incidents
in
your
sacred
life
i
was
addressing
srimati
kashi
moni
the
of
lahiri
mahasaya
finding
myself
in
benares
for
a
short
period
i
was
fulfilling
a
desire
to
visit
the
venerable
lady
she
received
me
graciously
at
the
old
lahiri
homestead
in
the
garudeswar
mohulla
section
of
benares
although
aged
she
was
blooming
like
a
lotus
silently
emanating
a
spiritual
fragrance
she
was
of
medium
build
with
a
slender
neck
and
fair
skin
large
lustrous
eyes
softened
her
motherly
face
son
you
are
welcome
here
come
upstairs
kashi
moni
led
the
way
to
a
very
small
room
where
for
a
time
she
had
lived
with
her
husband
i
felt
honored
to
witness
the
shrine
in
which
the
peerless
master
had
condescended
to
play
the
human
drama
of
matrimony
the
gentle
lady
motioned
me
to
a
pillow
seat
by
her
side
it
was
years
before
i
came
to
realize
the
divine
stature
of
my
husband
she
began
one
night
in
this
very
room
i
had
a
vivid
dream
glorious
angels
floated
in
unimaginable
grace
above
me
so
realistic
was
the
sight
that
i
awoke
at
once
the
room
was
strangely
enveloped
in
dazzling
light
my
husband
in
lotus
posture
was
levitated
in
the
center
of
the
room
surrounded
by
angels
who
were
worshiping
him
with
the
supplicating
dignity
of
hands
astonished
beyond
measure
i
was
convinced
that
i
was
still
dreaming
lahiri
mahasaya
said
are
not
dreaming
forsake
your
sleep
forever
and
forever
as
he
slowly
descended
to
the
floor
i
prostrated
myself
at
his
feet
i
cried
and
again
i
bow
before
you
will
you
pardon
me
for
having
considered
you
as
my
husband
i
die
with
shame
to
realize
that
i
have
remained
asleep
in
ignorance
by
the
side
of
one
who
is
divinely
awakened
from
this
night
you
are
no
longer
my
husband
but
my
guru
will
you
accept
my
insignificant
self
as
your
disciple
the
master
touched
me
gently
soul
arise
you
are
accepted
he
motioned
toward
the
angels
bow
in
turn
to
each
of
these
holy
saints
when
i
had
finished
my
humble
genuflections
the
angelic
voices
sounded
together
like
a
chorus
from
an
ancient
scripture
of
the
divine
one
thou
art
blessed
we
salute
thee
they
bowed
at
my
feet
and
lo
their
refulgent
forms
vanished
the
room
darkened
my
guru
asked
me
to
receive
initiation
into
kriya
yoga
course
i
responded
am
sorry
not
to
have
had
its
blessing
earlier
in
my
life
time
was
not
ripe
lahiri
mahasaya
smiled
consolingly
of
your
karma
i
have
silently
helped
you
to
work
out
now
you
are
willing
and
ready
he
touched
my
forehead
masses
of
whirling
light
appeared
the
radiance
gradually
formed
itself
into
the
spiritual
eye
ringed
in
gold
and
centered
with
a
white
pentagonal
star
your
consciousness
through
the
star
into
the
kingdom
of
the
infinite
my
guru
voice
had
a
new
note
soft
like
distant
music
vision
after
vision
broke
as
oceanic
surf
on
the
shores
of
my
soul
the
panoramic
spheres
finally
melted
in
a
sea
of
bliss
i
lost
myself
in
blessedness
when
i
returned
hours
later
to
awareness
of
this
world
the
master
gave
me
the
technique
of
kriya
yoga
from
that
night
on
lahiri
mahasaya
never
slept
in
my
room
again
nor
thereafter
did
he
ever
sleep
he
remained
in
the
front
room
downstairs
in
the
company
of
his
disciples
both
by
day
and
by
night
the
illustrious
lady
fell
into
silence
realizing
the
uniqueness
of
her
relationship
with
the
sublime
yogi
i
finally
ventured
to
ask
for
further
reminiscences
son
you
are
greedy
nevertheless
you
shall
have
one
more
story
she
smiled
shyly
i
will
confess
a
sin
which
i
committed
against
my
some
months
after
my
initiation
i
began
to
feel
forlorn
and
neglected
one
morning
lahiri
mahasaya
entered
this
little
room
to
fetch
an
article
i
quickly
followed
him
overcome
by
violent
delusion
i
addressed
him
scathingly
spend
all
your
time
with
the
disciples
what
about
your
responsibilities
for
your
wife
and
children
i
regret
that
you
do
not
interest
yourself
in
providing
more
money
for
the
family
the
master
glanced
at
me
for
a
moment
then
lo
he
was
gone
awed
and
frightened
i
heard
a
voice
resounding
from
every
part
of
the
room
is
all
nothing
do
you
see
how
could
a
nothing
like
me
produce
riches
for
you
i
cried
implore
pardon
a
million
times
my
sinful
eyes
can
see
you
no
more
please
appear
in
your
sacred
form
am
here
this
reply
came
from
above
me
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
master
materialize
in
the
air
his
head
touching
the
ceiling
his
eyes
were
like
blinding
flames
beside
myself
with
fear
i
lay
sobbing
at
his
feet
after
he
had
quietly
descended
to
the
floor
he
said
divine
wealth
not
the
paltry
tinsel
of
earth
after
acquiring
inward
treasure
you
will
find
that
outward
supply
is
always
forthcoming
he
added
of
my
spiritual
sons
will
make
provision
for
you
my
guru
words
naturally
came
true
a
disciple
did
leave
a
considerable
sum
for
our
family
i
thanked
kashi
moni
for
sharing
with
me
her
wondrous
experiences
on
the
following
day
i
returned
to
her
home
and
enjoyed
several
hours
of
philosophical
discussion
with
tincouri
and
ducouri
lahiri
these
two
saintly
sons
of
india
great
yogi
followed
closely
in
his
ideal
footsteps
both
men
were
fair
tall
stalwart
and
heavily
bearded
with
soft
voices
and
an
charm
of
manner
his
wife
was
not
the
only
woman
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
there
were
hundreds
of
others
including
my
mother
a
woman
chela
once
asked
the
guru
for
his
photograph
he
handed
her
a
print
remarking
if
you
deem
it
a
protection
then
it
is
so
otherwise
it
is
only
a
picture
a
few
days
later
this
woman
and
lahiri
mahasaya
happened
to
be
studying
the
bhagavad
gita
at
a
table
behind
which
hung
the
guru
photograph
an
electrical
storm
broke
out
with
great
fury
lahiri
mahasaya
protect
us
the
women
bowed
before
the
picture
lightning
struck
the
book
which
they
had
been
reading
but
the
two
devotees
were
unhurt
i
felt
as
though
a
sheet
of
ice
had
been
placed
around
me
to
ward
off
the
scorching
heat
the
chela
explained
lahiri
mahasaya
performed
two
miracles
in
connection
with
a
woman
disciple
abhoya
she
and
her
husband
a
calcutta
lawyer
started
one
day
for
benares
to
visit
the
guru
their
carriage
was
delayed
by
heavy
traffic
they
reached
the
howrah
main
station
only
to
hear
the
benares
train
whistling
for
departure
abhoya
near
the
ticket
office
stood
quietly
lahiri
mahasaya
i
beseech
thee
to
stop
the
train
she
silently
prayed
i
can
not
suffer
the
pangs
of
delay
in
waiting
another
day
to
see
thee
the
wheels
of
the
snorting
train
continued
to
move
round
and
round
but
there
was
no
onward
progress
the
engineer
and
passengers
descended
to
the
platform
to
view
the
phenomenon
an
english
railroad
guard
approached
abhoya
and
her
husband
contrary
to
all
precedent
he
volunteered
his
services
babu
he
said
give
me
the
money
i
will
buy
your
tickets
while
you
get
aboard
as
soon
as
the
couple
was
seated
and
had
received
the
tickets
the
train
slowly
moved
forward
in
panic
the
engineer
and
passengers
clambered
again
to
their
places
knowing
neither
how
the
train
started
nor
why
it
had
stopped
in
the
first
place
arriving
at
the
home
of
lahiri
mahasaya
in
benares
abhoya
silently
prostrated
herself
before
the
master
and
tried
to
touch
his
feet
compose
yourself
abhoya
he
remarked
how
you
love
to
bother
me
as
if
you
could
not
have
come
here
by
the
next
train
abhoya
visited
lahiri
mahasaya
on
another
memorable
occasion
this
time
she
wanted
his
intercession
not
with
a
train
but
with
the
stork
i
pray
you
to
bless
me
that
my
ninth
child
may
live
she
said
eight
babies
have
been
born
to
me
all
died
soon
after
birth
the
master
smiled
sympathetically
your
coming
child
will
live
please
follow
my
instructions
carefully
the
baby
a
girl
will
be
born
at
night
see
that
the
oil
lamp
is
kept
burning
until
dawn
do
not
fall
asleep
and
thus
allow
the
light
to
become
extinguished
abhoya
child
was
a
daughter
born
at
night
exactly
as
foreseen
by
the
omniscient
guru
the
mother
instructed
her
nurse
to
keep
the
lamp
filled
with
oil
both
women
kept
the
urgent
vigil
far
into
the
early
morning
hours
but
finally
fell
asleep
the
lamp
oil
was
almost
gone
the
light
flickered
feebly
the
bedroom
door
unlatched
and
flew
open
with
a
violent
sound
the
startled
women
awoke
their
astonished
eyes
beheld
the
form
of
lahiri
mahasaya
abhoya
behold
the
light
is
almost
gone
he
pointed
to
the
lamp
which
the
nurse
hastened
to
refill
as
soon
as
it
burned
again
brightly
the
master
vanished
the
door
closed
the
latch
was
affixed
without
visible
agency
abhoya
ninth
child
survived
in
when
i
made
inquiry
she
was
still
living
one
of
lahiri
mahasaya
disciples
the
venerable
kali
kumar
roy
related
to
me
many
fascinating
details
of
his
life
with
the
master
i
was
often
a
guest
at
his
benares
home
for
weeks
at
a
time
roy
told
me
i
observed
that
many
saintly
figures
danda
swamis
arrived
in
the
quiet
of
night
to
sit
at
the
guru
feet
sometimes
they
would
engage
in
discussion
of
meditational
and
philosophical
points
at
dawn
the
exalted
guests
would
depart
i
found
during
my
visits
that
lahiri
mahasaya
did
not
once
lie
down
to
sleep
during
an
early
period
of
my
association
with
the
master
i
had
to
contend
with
the
opposition
of
my
employer
roy
went
on
he
was
steeped
in
materialism
do
want
religious
fanatics
on
my
staff
he
would
sneer
i
ever
meet
your
charlatan
guru
i
shall
give
him
some
words
to
remember
this
alarming
threat
failed
to
interrupt
my
regular
program
i
spent
nearly
every
evening
in
my
guru
presence
one
night
my
employer
followed
me
and
rushed
rudely
into
the
parlor
he
was
doubtless
fully
bent
on
uttering
the
pulverizing
remarks
he
had
promised
no
sooner
had
the
man
seated
himself
than
lahiri
mahasaya
addressed
the
little
group
of
about
twelve
disciples
you
all
like
to
see
a
picture
when
we
nodded
he
asked
us
to
darken
the
room
behind
one
another
in
a
circle
he
said
place
your
hands
over
the
eyes
of
the
man
in
front
of
you
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
that
my
employer
also
was
following
albeit
unwillingly
the
master
directions
in
a
few
minutes
lahiri
mahasaya
asked
us
what
we
were
seeing
i
replied
beautiful
woman
appears
she
wears
a
sari
and
stands
near
an
plant
all
the
other
disciples
gave
the
same
description
the
master
turned
to
my
employer
you
recognize
that
woman
the
man
was
evidently
struggling
with
emotions
new
to
his
nature
have
been
foolishly
spending
my
money
on
her
though
i
have
a
good
wife
i
am
ashamed
of
the
motives
which
brought
me
here
will
you
forgive
me
and
receive
me
as
a
disciple
you
lead
a
good
moral
life
for
six
months
i
shall
accept
you
the
master
enigmatically
added
i
wo
have
to
initiate
you
for
three
months
my
employer
refrained
from
temptation
then
he
resumed
his
former
relationship
with
the
woman
two
months
later
he
died
thus
i
came
to
understand
my
guru
veiled
prophecy
about
the
improbability
of
the
man
initiation
lahiri
mahasaya
had
a
very
famous
friend
swami
trailanga
who
was
reputed
to
be
over
three
hundred
years
old
the
two
yogis
often
sat
together
in
meditation
trailanga
fame
is
so
widespread
that
few
hindus
would
deny
the
possibility
of
truth
in
any
story
of
his
astounding
miracles
if
christ
returned
to
earth
and
walked
the
streets
of
new
york
displaying
his
divine
powers
it
would
cause
the
same
excitement
that
was
created
by
trailanga
decades
ago
as
he
passed
through
the
crowded
lanes
of
benares
on
many
occasions
the
swami
was
seen
to
drink
with
no
ill
effect
the
most
deadly
poisons
thousands
of
people
including
a
few
who
are
still
living
have
seen
trailanga
floating
on
the
ganges
for
days
together
he
would
sit
on
top
of
the
water
or
remain
hidden
for
very
long
periods
under
the
waves
a
common
sight
at
the
benares
bathing
ghats
was
the
swami
motionless
body
on
the
blistering
stone
slabs
wholly
exposed
to
the
merciless
indian
sun
by
these
feats
trailanga
sought
to
teach
men
that
a
yogi
life
does
not
depend
upon
oxygen
or
ordinary
conditions
and
precautions
whether
he
were
above
water
or
under
it
and
whether
or
not
his
body
lay
exposed
to
the
fierce
solar
rays
the
master
proved
that
he
lived
by
divine
consciousness
death
could
not
touch
him
the
yogi
was
great
not
only
spiritually
but
physically
his
weight
exceeded
three
hundred
pounds
a
pound
for
each
year
of
his
life
as
he
ate
very
seldom
the
mystery
is
increased
a
master
however
easily
ignores
all
usual
rules
of
health
when
he
desires
to
do
so
for
some
special
reason
often
a
subtle
one
known
only
to
himself
great
saints
who
have
awakened
from
the
cosmic
mayic
dream
and
realized
this
world
as
an
idea
in
the
divine
mind
can
do
as
they
wish
with
the
body
knowing
it
to
be
only
a
manipulatable
form
of
condensed
or
frozen
energy
though
physical
scientists
now
understand
that
matter
is
nothing
but
congealed
energy
masters
have
long
passed
from
theory
to
practice
in
the
field
of
trailanga
always
remained
completely
nude
the
harassed
police
of
benares
came
to
regard
him
as
a
baffling
problem
child
the
natural
swami
like
the
early
adam
in
the
garden
of
eden
was
utterly
unconscious
of
his
nakedness
the
police
were
quite
conscious
of
it
however
and
unceremoniously
committed
him
to
jail
general
embarrassment
ensued
the
enormous
body
of
trailanga
was
soon
seen
in
its
usual
entirety
on
the
prison
roof
his
cell
still
securely
locked
offered
no
clue
to
his
mode
of
escape
the
discouraged
officers
of
the
law
once
more
performed
their
duty
this
time
a
guard
was
posted
before
the
swami
cell
might
again
retired
before
right
trailanga
was
soon
observed
in
his
nonchalant
stroll
over
the
roof
justice
is
blind
the
outwitted
police
decided
to
follow
her
example
the
great
yogi
preserved
a
habitual
silence
in
spite
of
his
round
face
and
huge
stomach
trailanga
ate
only
occasionally
after
weeks
without
food
he
would
break
his
fast
with
potfuls
of
clabbered
milk
offered
to
him
by
devotees
a
skeptic
once
determined
to
expose
trailanga
as
a
charlatan
a
large
bucket
of
mixture
used
in
whitewashing
walls
was
placed
before
the
swami
master
the
materialist
said
in
mock
reverence
i
have
brought
you
some
clabbered
milk
please
drink
it
trailanga
unhesitatingly
drained
to
the
last
drop
the
containerful
of
burning
lime
in
a
few
minutes
the
evildoer
fell
to
the
ground
in
agony
help
swami
help
he
cried
i
am
on
fire
forgive
my
wicked
test
the
great
yogi
broke
his
habitual
silence
scoffer
he
said
you
did
not
realize
when
you
offered
me
poison
that
my
life
is
one
with
your
own
except
for
my
knowledge
that
god
is
present
in
my
stomach
as
in
every
atom
of
creation
the
lime
would
have
killed
me
now
that
you
know
the
divine
meaning
of
boomerang
never
again
play
tricks
on
anyone
the
sinner
healed
by
trailanga
words
slunk
feebly
away
the
reversal
of
pain
was
not
due
to
any
volition
of
the
master
but
came
about
through
unerring
application
of
the
law
of
justice
which
upholds
creation
farthest
swinging
orb
men
of
like
trailanga
allow
the
divine
law
to
operate
instantaneously
they
have
banished
forever
all
thwarting
crosscurrents
of
ego
the
automatic
adjustments
of
righteousness
often
paid
in
an
unexpected
coin
as
in
the
case
of
trailanga
and
his
would
be
murderer
assuage
our
hasty
indignance
at
human
injustice
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
what
need
for

brief

the
universe
duly
conspires
for
retribution
dull
minds
discredit
the
possibility
of
divine
justice
love
omniscience
immortality
airy
scriptural
conjectures
this
insensitive
viewpoint
aweless
before
the
cosmic
spectacle
arouses
a
train
of
events
which
brings
its
own
awakening
the
omnipotence
of
spiritual
law
was
referred
to
by
christ
on
the
occasion
of
his
triumphant
entry
into
jerusalem
as
the
disciples
and
the
multitude
shouted
for
joy
and
cried
peace
in
heaven
and
glory
in
the
highest
certain
pharisees
complained
of
the
undignified
spectacle
master
they
protested
rebuke
thy
disciples
i
tell
you
jesus
replied
that
if
these
should
hold
their
peace
the
stones
would
immediately
cry
out
in
this
reprimand
to
the
pharisees
christ
was
pointing
out
that
divine
justice
is
no
figurative
abstraction
and
that
a
man
of
peace
though
his
tongue
be
torn
from
its
roots
will
yet
find
his
speech
and
his
defense
in
the
bedrock
of
creation
the
universal
order
itself
think
you
jesus
was
saying
to
silence
men
of
peace
as
well
may
you
hope
to
throttle
the
voice
of
god
whose
very
stones
sing
his
glory
and
his
omnipresence
will
you
demand
that
men
not
celebrate
in
honor
of
the
peace
in
heaven
but
should
only
gather
together
in
multitudes
to
shout
for
war
on
earth
then
make
your
preparations
o
pharisees
to
overtopple
the
foundations
of
the
world
for
it
is
not
gentle
men
alone
but
stones
or
earth
and
water
and
fire
and
air
that
will
rise
up
against
you
to
bear
witness
of
his
ordered
harmony
the
grace
of
the
christlike
yogi
trailanga
was
once
bestowed
on
my
sajo
mama
maternal
uncle
one
morning
uncle
saw
the
master
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
devotees
at
a
benares
ghat
he
managed
to
edge
his
way
close
to
trailanga
whose
feet
he
touched
humbly
uncle
was
astonished
to
find
himself
instantly
freed
from
a
painful
chronic
disease
the
only
known
living
disciple
of
the
great
yogi
is
a
woman
shankari
mai
jiew
daughter
of
one
of
trailanga
disciples
she
received
the
swami
training
from
her
early
childhood
she
lived
for
forty
years
in
a
series
of
lonely
himalayan
caves
near
badrinath
kedarnath
amarnath
and
pasupatinath
the
brahmacharini
woman
ascetic
born
in
is
now
well
over
the
century
mark
not
aged
in
appearance
however
she
has
retained
her
black
hair
sparkling
teeth
and
amazing
energy
she
comes
out
of
her
seclusion
every
few
years
to
attend
the
periodical
melas
or
religious
fairs
this
woman
saint
often
visited
lahiri
mahasaya
she
has
related
that
one
day
in
the
barackpur
section
near
calcutta
while
she
was
sitting
by
lahiri
mahasaya
side
his
great
guru
babaji
quietly
entered
the
room
and
held
converse
with
them
both
on
one
occasion
her
master
trailanga
forsaking
his
usual
silence
honored
lahiri
mahasaya
very
pointedly
in
public
a
benares
disciple
objected
sir
he
said
why
do
you
a
swami
and
a
renunciate
show
such
respect
to
a
householder
my
son
trailanga
replied
lahiri
mahasaya
is
like
a
divine
kitten
remaining
wherever
the
cosmic
mother
has
placed
him
while
dutifully
playing
the
part
of
a
worldly
man
he
has
received
that
perfect
for
which
i
have
renounced
even
my
loincloth
one
is
reminded
here
of
milton
line
he
for
god
only
she
for
god
in
him
the
venerable
mother
passed
on
at
benares
in
staff
symbolizing
the
spinal
cord
carried
ritually
by
certain
orders
of
monks
he
was
a
muni
a
monk
who
observes
mauna
spiritual
silence
the
sanskrit
root
muni
is
akin
to
greek
monos
alone
single
from
which
are
derived
the
english
words
monk
monism
etc
romans
luke
the
lives
of
trailanga
and
other
great
masters
remind
us
of
jesus
words
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
in
my
name
the
christ
consciousness
they
shall
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
they
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay
hands
on

and
they
shall

chapter
rama
is
raised
from
the
dead
now
a
certain
man
was
sick
named
lazarus
when
jesus
heard
that
he
said
this
sickness
is
not
unto
death
but
for
the
glory
of
god
that
the
son
of
god
might
be
glorified
thereby
sri
yukteswar
was
expounding
the
christian
scriptures
one
sunny
morning
on
the
balcony
of
his
serampore
hermitage
besides
a
few
of
master
other
disciples
i
was
present
with
a
small
group
of
my
ranchi
students
in
this
passage
jesus
calls
himself
the
son
of
god
though
he
was
truly
united
with
god
his
reference
here
has
a
deep
impersonal
significance
my
guru
explained
the
son
of
god
is
the
christ
or
divine
consciousness
in
man
no
mortal
can
glorify
god
the
only
honor
that
man
can
pay
his
creator
is
to
seek
him
man
can
not
glorify
an
abstraction
that
he
does
not
know
the
or
nimbus
around
the
head
of
the
saints
is
a
symbolic
witness
of
their
capacity
to
render
divine
homage
sri
yukteswar
went
on
to
read
the
marvelous
story
of
resurrection
at
its
conclusion
master
fell
into
a
long
silence
the
sacred
book
open
on
his
knee
i
too
was
privileged
to
behold
a
similar
miracle
my
guru
finally
spoke
with
solemn
unction
lahiri
mahasaya
resurrected
one
of
my
friends
from
the
dead
the
young
lads
at
my
side
smiled
with
keen
interest
there
was
enough
of
the
boy
in
me
too
to
enjoy
not
only
the
philosophy
but
in
particular
any
story
i
could
get
sri
yukteswar
to
relate
about
his
wondrous
experiences
with
his
guru
my
friend
rama
and
i
were
inseparable
master
began
because
he
was
shy
and
reclusive
he
chose
to
visit
our
guru
lahiri
mahasaya
only
during
the
hours
of
midnight
and
dawn
when
the
crowd
of
daytime
disciples
was
absent
as
rama
closest
friend
i
served
as
a
spiritual
vent
through
which
he
let
out
the
wealth
of
his
spiritual
perceptions
i
found
inspiration
in
his
ideal
companionship
my
guru
face
softened
with
memories
rama
was
suddenly
put
to
a
severe
test
sri
yukteswar
continued
he
contracted
the
disease
of
asiatic
cholera
as
our
master
never
objected
to
the
services
of
physicians
at
times
of
serious
illness
two
specialists
were
summoned
amidst
the
frantic
rush
of
ministering
to
the
stricken
man
i
was
deeply
praying
to
lahiri
mahasaya
for
help
i
hurried
to
his
home
and
sobbed
out
the
story
doctors
are
seeing
rama
he
will
be
well
my
guru
smiled
jovially
i
returned
with
a
light
heart
to
my
friend
bedside
only
to
find
him
in
a
dying
state
can
not
last
more
than
one
or
two
hours
one
of
the
physicians
told
me
with
a
gesture
of
despair
once
more
i
hastened
to
lahiri
mahasaya
doctors
are
conscientious
men
i
am
sure
rama
will
be
well
the
master
dismissed
me
blithely
at
rama
place
i
found
both
doctors
gone
one
had
left
me
a
note
have
done
our
best
but
his
case
is
hopeless
my
friend
was
indeed
the
picture
of
a
dying
man
i
did
not
understand
how
lahiri
mahasaya
words
could
fail
to
come
true
yet
the
sight
of
rama
rapidly
ebbing
life
kept
suggesting
to
my
mind
is
over
now
tossing
thus
on
the
seas
of
faith
and
apprehensive
doubt
i
ministered
to
my
friend
as
best
i
could
he
roused
himself
to
cry
out
run
to
master
and
tell
him
i
am
gone
ask
him
to
bless
my
body
before
its
last
rites
with
these
words
rama
sighed
heavily
and
gave
up
the
ghost
i
wept
for
an
hour
by
his
beloved
form
always
a
lover
of
quiet
now
he
had
attained
the
utter
stillness
of
death
another
disciple
came
in
i
asked
him
to
remain
in
the
house
until
i
returned
i
trudged
back
to
my
guru
is
rama
now
lahiri
mahasaya
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
you
will
soon
see
how
he
is
i
blurted
out
emotionally
a
few
hours
you
will
see
his
body
before
it
is
carried
to
the
crematory
grounds
i
broke
down
and
moaned
openly
control
yourself
sit
calmly
and
meditate
my
guru
retired
into
samadhi
the
afternoon
and
night
passed
in
unbroken
silence
i
struggled
unsuccessfully
to
regain
an
inner
composure
at
dawn
lahiri
mahasaya
glanced
at
me
consolingly
see
you
are
still
disturbed
why
did
you
explain
yesterday
that
you
expected
me
to
give
rama
tangible
aid
in
the
form
of
some
medicine
the
master
pointed
to
a
lamp
containing
crude
castor
oil
a
little
bottle
from
the
lamp
put
seven
drops
into
mouth
i
remonstrated
has
been
dead
since
yesterday
noon
of
what
use
is
the
oil
now
mind
just
do
as
i
ask
lahiri
mahasaya
cheerful
mood
was
incomprehensible
i
was
still
in
the
unassuaged
agony
of
bereavement
pouring
out
a
small
amount
of
oil
i
departed
for
rama
house
i
found
my
friend
body
rigid
in
the
paying
no
attention
to
his
ghastly
condition
i
opened
his
lips
with
my
right
finger
and
managed
with
my
left
hand
and
the
help
of
the
cork
to
put
the
oil
drop
by
drop
over
his
clenched
teeth
as
the
seventh
drop
touched
his
cold
lips
rama
shivered
violently
his
muscles
vibrated
from
head
to
foot
as
he
sat
up
wonderingly
saw
lahiri
mahasaya
in
a
blaze
of
light
he
cried
shone
like
the
sun
forsake
your
sleep
he
commanded
me
with
yukteswar
to
see
me
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
when
rama
dressed
himself
and
was
strong
enough
after
that
fatal
sickness
to
walk
to
the
home
of
our
guru
there
he
prostrated
himself
before
lahiri
mahasaya
with
tears
of
gratitude
the
master
was
beside
himself
with
mirth
his
eyes
twinkled
at
me
mischievously
he
said
henceforth
you
will
not
fail
to
carry
with
you
a
bottle
of
castor
oil
whenever
you
see
a
corpse
just
administer
the
oil
why
seven
drops
of
lamp
oil
must
surely
foil
the
power
of
yama
you
are
ridiculing
me
i
do
understand
please
point
out
the
nature
of
my
error
told
you
twice
that
rama
would
be
well
yet
you
could
not
fully
believe
me
lahiri
mahasaya
explained
did
not
mean
the
doctors
would
be
able
to
cure
him
i
remarked
only
that
they
were
in
attendance
there
was
no
causal
connection
between
my
two
statements
i
did
want
to
interfere
with
the
physicians
they
have
to
live
too
in
a
voice
resounding
with
joy
my
guru
added
know
that
the
inexhaustible
paramatman
can
heal
anyone
doctor
or
no
doctor
see
my
mistake
i
acknowledged
remorsefully
know
now
that
your
simple
word
is
binding
on
the
whole
cosmos
as
sri
yukteswar
finished
the
awesome
story
one
of
the
spellbound
listeners
ventured
a
question
that
from
a
child
was
doubly
understandable
sir
he
said
why
did
your
guru
use
castor
oil
child
giving
the
oil
had
no
meaning
except
that
i
expected
something
material
and
lahiri
mahasaya
chose
the
oil
as
an
objective
symbol
for
awakening
my
greater
faith
the
master
allowed
rama
to
die
because
i
had
partially
doubted
but
the
divine
guru
knew
that
inasmuch
as
he
had
said
the
disciple
would
be
well
the
healing
must
take
place
even
though
he
had
to
cure
rama
of
death
a
disease
usually
final
sri
yukteswar
dismissed
the
little
group
and
motioned
me
to
a
blanket
seat
at
his
feet
yogananda
he
said
with
unusual
gravity
you
have
been
surrounded
from
birth
by
direct
disciples
of
lahiri
mahasaya
the
great
master
lived
his
sublime
life
in
partial
seclusion
and
steadfastly
refused
to
permit
his
followers
to
build
any
organization
around
his
teachings
he
made
nevertheless
a
significant
prediction
fifty
years
after
my
passing
he
said
life
will
be
written
because
of
a
deep
interest
in
yoga
which
the
west
will
manifest
the
yogic
message
will
encircle
the
globe
and
aid
in
establishing
that
brotherhood
of
man
which
results
from
direct
perception
of
the
one
father
my
son
yogananda
sri
yukteswar
went
on
you
must
do
your
part
in
spreading
that
message
and
in
writing
that
sacred
life
fifty
years
after
lahiri
mahasaya
passing
in
culminated
in
the
year
of
completion
of
this
present
book
i
can
not
but
be
struck
by
the
coincidence
that
the
year
has
also
ushered
in
a
new
era
of
revolutionary
atomic
energies
all
thoughtful
minds
turn
as
never
before
to
the
urgent
problems
of
peace
and
brotherhood
lest
the
continued
use
of
physical
force
banish
all
men
along
with
the
problems
though
the
human
race
and
its
works
disappear
tracelessly
by
time
or
bomb
the
sun
does
not
falter
in
its
course
the
stars
keep
their
invariable
vigil
cosmic
law
can
not
be
stayed
or
changed
and
man
would
do
well
to
put
himself
in
harmony
with
it
if
the
cosmos
is
against
might
if
the
sun
wars
not
with
the
planets
but
retires
at
dueful
time
to
give
the
stars
their
little
sway
what
avails
our
mailed
fist
shall
any
peace
indeed
come
out
of
it
not
cruelty
but
good
will
arms
the
universal
sinews
a
humanity
at
peace
will
know
the
endless
fruits
of
victory
sweeter
to
the
taste
than
any
nurtured
on
the
soil
of
blood
the
effective
league
of
nations
will
be
a
natural
nameless
league
of
human
hearts
the
broad
sympathies
and
discerning
insight
needed
for
the
healing
of
earthly
woes
can
not
flow
from
a
mere
intellectual
consideration
of
man
diversities
but
from
knowledge
of
sole
kinship
with
god
toward
realization
of
the
highest
through
yoga
the
science
of
personal
contact
with
the
divine
spread
in
time
to
all
men
in
all
lands
though
india
civilization
is
ancient
above
any
other
few
historians
have
noted
that
her
feat
of
national
survival
is
by
no
means
an
accident
but
a
logical
incident
in
the
devotion
to
eternal
verities
which
india
has
offered
through
her
best
men
in
every
generation
by
sheer
continuity
of
being
by
intransitivity
before
the
dusty
scholars
truly
tell
us
how
many
has
given
the
worthiest
answer
of
any
people
to
the
challenge
of
time
the
biblical
story
of
abraham
plea
to
the
lord
that
the
city
of
sodom
be
spared
if
ten
righteous
men
could
be
found
therein
and
the
divine
reply
i
will
not
destroy
it
for
ten
sake
gains
new
meaning
in
the
light
of
india
escape
from
the
oblivion
of
babylon
egypt
and
other
mighty
nations
who
were
once
her
contemporaries
the
lord
answer
clearly
shows
that
a
land
lives
not
by
its
material
achievements
but
in
its
masterpieces
of
man
let
the
divine
words
be
heard
again
in
this
twentieth
century
twice
dyed
in
blood
ere
half
over
no
nation
that
can
produce
ten
men
great
in
the
eyes
of
the
unbribable
judge
shall
know
extinction
heeding
such
persuasions
india
has
proved
herself
not
witless
against
the
thousand
cunnings
of
time
masters
in
every
century
have
hallowed
her
soil
modern
christlike
sages
like
lahiri
mahasaya
and
his
disciple
sri
yukteswar
rise
up
to
proclaim
that
the
science
of
yoga
is
more
vital
than
any
material
advances
to
man
happiness
and
to
a
nation
longevity
very
scanty
information
about
the

of
lahiri

and
his
universal
doctrine
has
ever
appeared

for
three
decades
in

and

i
have
found
a
deep
and
sincere
interest
in
his
message
of
liberating
yoga
a

as
he

in
it
was
written
by
my
disciple
swami
satyananda
who
for
many
years
has
been
the
acharya
spiritual
preceptor
at
our
vidyalaya
in
ranchi
i
have
translated
a
few
passages
from
his
book
and
have
incorporated
them
into
this
section
devoted
to
lahiri
mahasaya
it
was
into
a
pious
brahmin
family
of
ancient
lineage
that
lahiri
mahasaya
was
born
september
his
birthplace
was
the
village
of
ghurni
in
the
nadia
district
near
krishnagar
bengal
he
was
the
youngest
son
of
muktakashi
the
second
wife
of
the
esteemed
gaur
mohan
lahiri
his
first
wife
after
the
birth
of
three
sons
had
died
during
a
pilgrimage
the
boy
mother
passed
away
during
his
childhood
little
about
her
is
known
except
the
revealing
fact
that
she
was
an
ardent
devotee
of
lord
shiva
scripturally
designated
as
the
king
of
yogis
the
boy
lahiri
whose
given
name
was
shyama
charan
spent
his
early
years
in
the
ancestral
home
at
nadia
at
the
age
of
three
or
four
he
was
often
observed
sitting
under
the
sands
in
the
posture
of
a
yogi
his
body
completely
hidden
except
for
the
head
the
lahiri
estate
was
destroyed
in
the
winter
of
when
the
nearby
jalangi
river
changed
its
course
and
disappeared
into
the
depths
of
the
ganges
one
of
the
shiva
temples
founded
by
the
lahiris
went
into
the
river
along
with
the
family
home
a
devotee
rescued
the
stone
image
of
lord
shiva
from
the
swirling
waters
and
placed
it
in
a
new
temple
now
as
the
ghurni
shiva
site
gaur
mohan
lahiri
and
his
family
left
nadia
and
became
residents
of
benares
where
the
father
immediately
erected
a
shiva
temple
he
conducted
his
household
along
the
lines
of
vedic
discipline
with
regular
observance
of
ceremonial
worship
acts
of
charity
and
scriptural
study
just
and
however
he
did
not
ignore
the
beneficial
current
of
modern
ideas
the
boy
lahiri
took
lessons
in
hindi
and
urdu
in
benares
he
attended
a
school
conducted
by
joy
narayan
ghosal
receiving
instruction
in
sanskrit
bengali
french
and
english
applying
himself
to
a
close
study
of
the
vedas
the
young
yogi
listened
eagerly
to
scriptural
discussions
by
learned
brahmins
including
a
marhatta
pundit
named
shyama
charan
was
a
kind
gentle
and
courageous
youth
beloved
by
all
his
companions
with
a
bright
and
powerful
body
he
excelled
in
swimming
and
in
many
skillful
activities
in
shyama
charan
lahiri
was
married
to
srimati
kashi
moni
daughter
of
sri
debnarayan
sanyal
a
model
indian
housewife
kashi
moni
cheerfully
carried
on
her
home
duties
and
the
traditional
householder
obligation
to
serve
guests
and
the
poor
two
saintly
sons
tincouri
and
ducouri
blessed
the
union
at
the
age
of
in
lahiri
mahasaya
took
the
post
of
accountant
in
the
military
engineering
department
of
the
english
government
he
received
many
promotions
during
the
time
of
his
service
thus
not
only
was
he
a
master
before
god
eyes
but
also
a
success
in
the
little
human
drama
where
he
played
his
given
role
as
an
office
worker
in
the
world
as
the
offices
of
the
army
department
were
shifted
lahiri
mahasaya
was
transferred
to
gazipur
mirjapur
danapur
naini
tal
benares
and
other
localities
after
the
death
of
his
father
lahiri
had
to
assume
the
entire
responsibility
of
his
family
for
whom
he
bought
a
quiet
residence
in
the
garudeswar
mohulla
neighborhood
of
benares
it
was
in
his
year
that
lahiri
mahasaya
saw
fulfillment
of
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
been
reincarnated
on
earth
the
flame
long
smouldering
received
its
opportunity
to
burst
into
flame
a
divine
decree
resting
beyond
the
gaze
of
human
beings
works
mysteriously
to
bring
all
things
into
outer
manifestation
at
the
proper
time
he
met
his
great
guru
babaji
near
ranikhet
and
was
initiated
by
him
into
kriya
yoga
this
auspicious
event
did
not
happen
to
him
alone
it
was
a
fortunate
moment
for
all
the
human
race
many
of
whom
were
later
privileged
to
receive
the
gift
of
kriya
the
lost
or
highest
art
of
yoga
was
again
being
brought
to
light
many
spiritually
thirsty
men
and
women
eventually
found
their
way
to
the
cool
waters
of
kriya
yoga
just
as
in
the
hindu
legend
where
mother
ganges
offers
her
divine
draught
to
the
parched
devotee
bhagirath
so
the
celestial
flood
of
kriya
rolled
from
the
secret
fastnesses
of
the
himalayas
into
the
dusty
haunts
of
men
john

chapter
babaji
the
of
modern
india
the
northern
himalayan
crags
near
badrinarayan
are
still
blessed
by
the
living
presence
of
babaji
guru
of
lahiri
mahasaya
the
secluded
master
has
retained
his
physical
form
for
centuries
perhaps
for
millenniums
the
deathless
babaji
is
an
avatara
this
sanskrit
word
means
descent
its
roots
are
ava
down
and
tri
to
pass
in
the
hindu
scriptures
avatara
signifies
the
descent
of
divinity
into
flesh
babaji
spiritual
state
is
beyond
human
comprehension
sri
yukteswar
explained
to
me
the
dwarfed
vision
of
men
can
not
pierce
to
his
transcendental
star
one
attempts
in
vain
even
to
picture
the
avatar
attainment
it
is
inconceivable
the
upanishads
have
minutely
classified
every
stage
of
spiritual
advancement
a
siddha
perfected
being
has
progressed
from
the
state
of
a
jivanmukta
freed
while
living
to
that
of
a
paramukta
supremely
free
power
over
death
the
latter
has
completely
escaped
from
the
mayic
thralldom
and
its
reincarnational
round
the
paramukta
therefore
seldom
returns
to
a
physical
body
if
he
does
he
is
an
avatar
a
divinely
appointed
medium
of
supernal
blessings
on
the
world
an
avatar
is
unsubject
to
the
universal
economy
his
pure
body
visible
as
a
light
image
is
free
from
any
debt
to
nature
the
casual
gaze
may
see
nothing
extraordinary
in
an
avatar
form
but
it
casts
no
shadow
nor
makes
any
footprint
on
the
ground
these
are
outward
symbolic
proofs
of
an
inward
lack
of
darkness
and
material
bondage
such
a
alone
knows
the
truth
behind
the
relativities
of
life
and
death
omar
khayyam
so
grossly
misunderstood
sang
of
this
liberated
man
in
his
immortal
scripture
the
rubaiyat
ah
moon
of
my
delight
who
no
wane
the
moon
of
is
rising
once
again
how
oft
hereafter
rising
shall
she
look
through
this
same
garden
after
vain
the
moon
of
delight
is
god
eternal
polaris
anachronous
never
the
moon
of
is
the
outward
cosmos
fettered
to
the
law
of
periodic
recurrence
its
chains
had
been
dissolved
forever
by
the
persian
seer
through
his
how
oft
hereafter
rising
shall
she
look
after
vain
what
frustration
of
search
by
a
frantic
universe
for
an
absolute
omission
christ
expressed
his
freedom
in
another
way
and
a
certain
scribe
came
and
said
unto
him
master
i
will
follow
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest
and
jesus
saith
unto
him
the
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head
spacious
with
omnipresence
could
christ
indeed
be
followed
except
in
the
overarching
spirit
krishna
rama
buddha
and
patanjali
were
among
the
ancient
indian
avatars
a
considerable
poetic
literature
in
tamil
has
grown
up
around
agastya
a
south
indian
avatar
he
worked
many
miracles
during
the
centuries
preceding
and
following
the
christian
era
and
is
credited
with
retaining
his
physical
form
even
to
this
day
babaji
mission
in
india
has
been
to
assist
prophets
in
carrying
out
their
special
dispensations
he
thus
qualifies
for
the
scriptural
classification
of
mahavatar
great
avatar
he
has
stated
that
he
gave
yoga
initiation
to
shankara
ancient
founder
of
the
swami
order
and
to
kabir
famous
medieval
saint
his
chief
disciple
was
as
we
know
lahiri
mahasaya
revivalist
of
the
lost
kriya
art
illustration
babaji
the
mahavatar
guru
of
lahiri
mahasaya
i
have
helped
an
artist
to
draw
a
true
likeness
of
the
great
of
modern
see
the
mahavatar
is
in
constant
communion
with
christ
together
they
send
out
vibrations
of
redemption
and
have
planned
the
spiritual
technique
of
salvation
for
this
age
the
work
of
these
two
with
the
body
and
one
without
to
inspire
the
nations
to
forsake
suicidal
wars
race
hatreds
religious
sectarianism
and
the
of
materialism
babaji
is
well
aware
of
the
trend
of
modern
times
especially
of
the
influence
and
complexities
of
western
civilization
and
realizes
the
necessity
of
spreading
the
of
yoga
equally
in
the
west
and
in
the
east
that
there
is
no
historical
reference
to
babaji
need
not
surprise
us
the
great
guru
has
never
openly
appeared
in
any
century
the
misinterpreting
glare
of
publicity
has
no
place
in
his
millennial
plans
like
the
creator
the
sole
but
silent
power
babaji
works
in
a
humble
obscurity
great
prophets
like
christ
and
krishna
come
to
earth
for
a
specific
and
spectacular
purpose
they
depart
as
soon
as
it
is
accomplished
other
avatars
like
babaji
undertake
work
which
is
concerned
more
with
the
slow
evolutionary
progress
of
man
during
the
centuries
than
with
any
one
outstanding
event
of
history
such
masters
always
veil
themselves
from
the
gross
public
gaze
and
have
the
power
to
become
invisible
at
will
for
these
reasons
and
because
they
generally
instruct
their
disciples
to
maintain
silence
about
them
a
number
of
towering
spiritual
figures
remain
i
give
in
these
pages
on
babaji
merely
a
hint
of
his
a
few
facts
which
he
deems
it
fit
and
helpful
to
be
publicly
imparted
no
limiting
facts
about
babaji
family
or
birthplace
dear
to
the
annalist
heart
have
ever
been
discovered
his
speech
is
generally
in
hindi
but
he
converses
easily
in
any
language
he
has
adopted
the
simple
name
of
babaji
revered
father
other
titles
of
respect
given
him
by
lahiri
mahasaya
disciples
are
mahamuni
babaji
maharaj
supreme
ecstatic
saint
maha
yogi
greatest
of
yogis
trambak
baba
and
shiva
baba
titles
of
avatars
of
shiva
does
it
matter
that
we
know
not
the
patronymic
of
an
master
whenever
anyone
utters
with
reverence
the
name
of
babaji
lahiri
mahasaya
said
that
devotee
attracts
an
instant
spiritual
blessing
the
deathless
guru
bears
no
marks
of
age
on
his
body
he
appears
to
be
no
more
than
a
youth
of
of
medium
build
and
height
babaji
beautiful
strong
body
radiates
a
perceptible
glow
his
eyes
are
dark
calm
and
tender
his
long
lustrous
hair
is
a
very
strange
fact
is
that
babaji
bears
an
extraordinarily
exact
resemblance
to
his
disciple
lahiri
mahasaya
the
similarity
is
so
striking
that
in
his
later
years
lahiri
mahasaya
might
have
passed
as
the
father
of
the
babaji
swami
kebalananda
my
saintly
sanskrit
tutor
spent
some
time
with
babaji
in
the
himalayas
the
peerless
master
moves
with
his
group
from
place
to
place
in
the
mountains
kebalananda
told
me
his
small
band
contains
two
highly
advanced
american
disciples
after
babaji
has
been
in
one
locality
for
some
time
he
says
danda
uthao
us
lift
our
camp
and
staff
he
carries
a
symbolic
danda
bamboo
staff
his
words
are
the
signal
for
moving
with
his
group
instantaneously
to
another
place
he
does
not
always
employ
this
method
of
astral
travel
sometimes
he
goes
on
foot
from
peak
to
peak
babaji
can
be
seen
or
recognized
by
others
only
when
he
so
desires
he
is
known
to
have
appeared
in
many
slightly
different
forms
to
various
without
beard
and
moustache
and
sometimes
with
them
as
his
undecaying
body
requires
no
food
the
master
seldom
eats
as
a
social
courtesy
to
visiting
disciples
he
occasionally
accepts
fruits
or
rice
cooked
in
milk
and
clarified
butter
two
amazing
incidents
of
babaji
life
are
known
to
me
kebalananda
went
on
his
disciples
were
sitting
one
night
around
a
huge
fire
which
was
blazing
for
a
sacred
vedic
ceremony
the
master
suddenly
seized
a
burning
log
and
lightly
struck
the
bare
shoulder
of
a
chela
who
was
close
to
the
fire
how
cruel
lahiri
mahasaya
who
was
present
made
this
remonstrance
you
rather
have
seen
him
burned
to
ashes
before
your
eyes
according
to
the
decree
of
his
past
karma
with
these
words
babaji
placed
his
healing
hand
on
the
disfigured
shoulder
have
freed
you
tonight
from
painful
death
the
karmic
law
has
been
satisfied
through
your
slight
suffering
by
fire
on
another
occasion
babaji
sacred
circle
was
disturbed
by
the
arrival
of
a
stranger
he
had
climbed
with
astonishing
skill
to
the
nearly
inaccessible
ledge
near
the
camp
of
the
master
you
must
be
the
great
babaji
the
man
face
was
lit
with
inexpressible
reverence
months
i
have
pursued
a
ceaseless
search
for
you
among
these
forbidding
crags
i
implore
you
to
accept
me
as
a
disciple
when
the
great
guru
made
no
response
the
man
pointed
to
the
rocky
chasm
at
his
feet
you
refuse
me
i
will
jump
from
this
mountain
life
has
no
further
value
if
i
can
not
win
your
guidance
to
the
divine
then
babaji
said
unemotionally
can
not
accept
you
in
your
present
state
of
development
the
man
immediately
hurled
himself
over
the
cliff
babaji
instructed
the
shocked
disciples
to
fetch
the
stranger
body
when
they
returned
with
the
mangled
form
the
master
placed
his
divine
hand
on
the
dead
man
lo
he
opened
his
eyes
and
prostrated
himself
humbly
before
the
omnipotent
one
are
now
ready
for
discipleship
babaji
beamed
lovingly
on
his
resurrected
chela
have
courageously
passed
a
difficult
test
death
shall
not
touch
you
again
now
you
are
one
of
our
immortal
flock
then
he
spoke
his
usual
words
of
departure
danda
uthao
the
whole
group
vanished
from
the
mountain
an
avatar
lives
in
the
omnipresent
spirit
for
him
there
is
no
distance
inverse
to
the
square
only
one
reason
therefore
can
motivate
babaji
in
maintaining
his
physical
form
from
century
to
century
the
desire
to
furnish
humanity
with
a
concrete
example
of
its
own
possibilities
were
man
never
vouchsafed
a
glimpse
of
divinity
in
the
flesh
he
would
remain
oppressed
by
the
heavy
mayic
delusion
that
he
can
not
transcend
his
mortality
jesus
knew
from
the
beginning
the
sequence
of
his
life
he
passed
through
each
event
not
for
himself
not
from
any
karmic
compulsion
but
solely
for
the
upliftment
of
reflective
human
beings
his
four
mark
luke
and
the
ineffable
drama
for
the
benefit
of
later
generations
for
babaji
also
there
is
no
relativity
of
past
present
future
from
the
beginning
he
has
known
all
phases
of
his
life
yet
accommodating
himself
to
the
limited
understanding
of
men
he
has
played
many
acts
of
his
divine
life
in
the
presence
of
one
or
more
witnesses
thus
it
came
about
that
a
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
was
present
when
babaji
deemed
the
time
to
be
ripe
for
him
to
proclaim
the
possibility
of
bodily
immortality
he
uttered
this
promise
before
ram
gopal
muzumdar
that
it
might
finally
become
known
for
the
inspiration
of
other
seeking
hearts
the
great
ones
speak
their
words
and
participate
in
the
seemingly
natural
course
of
events
solely
for
the
good
of
man
even
as
christ
said
father
i
knew
that
thou
hearest
me
always
but
because
of
the
people
which
stand
by
i
said
it
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me
during
my
visit
at
ranbajpur
with
ram
gopal
the
sleepless
saint
he
related
the
wondrous
story
of
his
first
meeting
with
babaji
i
sometimes
left
my
isolated
cave
to
sit
at
lahiri
mahasaya
feet
in
benares
ram
gopal
told
me
one
midnight
as
i
was
silently
meditating
in
a
group
of
his
disciples
the
master
made
a
surprising
request
gopal
he
said
at
once
to
the
dasasamedh
bathing
ghat
i
soon
reached
the
secluded
spot
the
night
was
bright
with
moonlight
and
the
glittering
stars
after
i
had
sat
in
patient
silence
for
awhile
my
attention
was
drawn
to
a
huge
stone
slab
near
my
feet
it
rose
gradually
revealing
an
underground
cave
as
the
stone
remained
balanced
in
some
unknown
manner
the
draped
form
of
a
young
and
surpassingly
lovely
woman
was
levitated
from
the
cave
high
into
the
air
surrounded
by
a
soft
halo
she
slowly
descended
in
front
of
me
and
stood
motionless
steeped
in
an
inner
state
of
ecstasy
she
finally
stirred
and
spoke
gently
am
mataji
the
sister
of
babaji
i
have
asked
him
and
also
lahiri
mahasaya
to
come
to
my
cave
tonight
to
discuss
a
matter
of
great
importance
a
nebulous
light
was
rapidly
floating
over
the
ganges
the
strange
luminescence
was
reflected
in
the
opaque
waters
it
approached
nearer
and
nearer
until
with
a
blinding
flash
it
appeared
by
the
side
of
mataji
and
condensed
itself
instantly
into
the
human
form
of
lahiri
mahasaya
he
bowed
humbly
at
the
feet
of
the
woman
saint
before
i
had
recovered
from
my
bewilderment
i
was
further
wonderstruck
to
behold
a
circling
mass
of
mystical
light
traveling
in
the
sky
descending
swiftly
the
flaming
whirlpool
neared
our
group
and
materialized
itself
into
the
body
of
a
beautiful
youth
who
i
understood
at
once
was
babaji
he
looked
like
lahiri
mahasaya
the
only
difference
being
that
babaji
appeared
much
younger
and
had
long
bright
hair
lahiri
mahasaya
mataji
and
myself
knelt
at
the
guru
feet
an
ethereal
sensation
of
beatific
glory
thrilled
every
fiber
of
my
being
as
i
touched
his
divine
flesh
sister
babaji
said
am
intending
to
shed
my
form
and
plunge
into
the
infinite
current
have
already
glimpsed
your
plan
beloved
master
i
wanted
to
discuss
it
with
you
tonight
why
should
you
leave
your
body
the
glorious
woman
looked
at
him
beseechingly
is
the
difference
if
i
wear
a
visible
or
invisible
wave
on
the
ocean
of
my
spirit
mataji
replied
with
a
quaint
flash
of
wit
guru
if
it
makes
no
difference
then
please
do
not
ever
relinquish
your
form
it
so
babaji
said
solemnly
will
never
leave
my
physical
body
it
will
always
remain
visible
to
at
least
a
small
number
of
people
on
this
earth
the
lord
has
spoken
his
own
wish
through
your
lips
as
i
listened
in
awe
to
the
conversation
between
these
exalted
beings
the
great
guru
turned
to
me
with
a
benign
gesture
not
ram
gopal
he
said
are
blessed
to
be
a
witness
at
the
scene
of
this
immortal
promise
as
the
sweet
melody
of
babaji
voice
faded
away
his
form
and
that
of
lahiri
mahasaya
slowly
levitated
and
moved
backward
over
the
ganges
an
aureole
of
dazzling
light
templed
their
bodies
as
they
vanished
into
the
night
sky
mataji
form
floated
to
the
cave
and
descended
the
stone
slab
closed
of
itself
as
if
working
on
an
invisible
leverage
infinitely
inspired
i
wended
my
way
back
to
lahiri
place
as
i
bowed
before
him
in
the
early
dawn
my
guru
smiled
at
me
understandingly
am
happy
for
you
ram
gopal
he
said
desire
of
meeting
babaji
and
mataji
which
you
have
often
expressed
to
me
has
found
at
last
a
sacred
fulfillment
my
fellow
disciples
informed
me
that
lahiri
mahasaya
had
not
moved
from
his
dais
since
early
the
preceding
evening
gave
a
wonderful
discourse
on
immortality
after
you
had
left
for
the
dasasamedh
ghat
one
of
the
chelas
told
me
for
the
first
time
i
fully
realized
the
truth
in
the
scriptural
verses
which
state
that
a
man
of
can
appear
at
different
places
in
two
or
more
bodies
at
the
same
time
lahiri
mahasaya
later
explained
to
me
many
metaphysical
points
concerning
the
hidden
divine
plan
for
this
earth
ram
gopal
concluded
babaji
has
been
chosen
by
god
to
remain
in
his
body
for
the
duration
of
this
particular
world
cycle
ages
shall
come
and
go
still
the
deathless

chapter
materializing
a
palace
in
the
himalayas
babaji
first
meeting
with
lahiri
mahasaya
is
an
enthralling
story
and
one
of
the
few
which
gives
us
a
detailed
glimpse
of
the
deathless
guru
these
words
were
swami
kebalananda
preamble
to
a
wondrous
tale
the
first
time
he
recounted
it
i
was
literally
spellbound
on
many
other
occasions
i
coaxed
my
gentle
sanskrit
tutor
to
repeat
the
story
which
was
later
told
me
in
substantially
the
same
words
by
sri
yukteswar
both
these
lahiri
mahasaya
disciples
had
heard
the
awesome
tale
direct
from
the
lips
of
their
guru
my
first
meeting
with
babaji
took
place
in
my
year
lahiri
mahasaya
had
said
in
the
autumn
of
i
was
stationed
in
danapur
as
a
government
accountant
in
the
military
engineering
department
one
morning
the
office
manager
summoned
me
he
said
telegram
has
just
come
from
our
main
office
you
are
to
be
transferred
to
ranikhet
where
an
army
post
is
now
being
established
with
one
servant
i
set
out
on
the
trip
traveling
by
horse
and
buggy
we
arrived
in
thirty
days
at
the
himalayan
site
of
ranikhet
my
office
duties
were
not
onerous
i
was
able
to
spend
many
hours
roaming
in
the
magnificent
hills
a
rumor
reached
me
that
great
saints
blessed
the
region
with
their
presence
i
felt
a
strong
desire
to
see
them
during
a
ramble
one
early
afternoon
i
was
astounded
to
hear
a
distant
voice
calling
my
name
i
continued
my
vigorous
upward
climb
on
drongiri
mountain
a
slight
uneasiness
beset
me
at
the
thought
that
i
might
not
be
able
to
retrace
my
steps
before
darkness
had
descended
over
the
jungle
i
finally
reached
a
small
clearing
whose
sides
were
dotted
with
caves
on
one
of
the
rocky
ledges
stood
a
smiling
young
man
extending
his
hand
in
welcome
i
noticed
with
astonishment
that
except
for
his
hair
he
bore
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
myself
you
have
come
the
saint
addressed
me
affectionately
in
hindi
here
in
this
cave
it
was
i
who
called
you
i
entered
a
neat
little
grotto
which
contained
several
woolen
blankets
and
a
few
kamandulus
begging
bowls
do
you
remember
that
seat
the
yogi
pointed
to
a
folded
blanket
in
one
corner
sir
somewhat
dazed
at
the
strangeness
of
my
adventure
i
added
must
leave
now
before
nightfall
i
have
business
in
the
morning
at
my
office
the
mysterious
saint
replied
in
english
office
was
brought
for
you
and
not
you
for
the
office
i
was
dumbfounded
that
this
forest
ascetic
should
not
only
speak
english
but
also
paraphrase
the
words
of
christ
see
my
telegram
took
effect
the
yogi
remark
was
incomprehensible
to
me
i
inquired
his
meaning
refer
to
the
telegram
that
summoned
you
to
these
isolated
parts
it
was
i
who
silently
suggested
to
the
mind
of
your
superior
officer
that
you
be
transferred
to
ranikhet
when
one
feels
his
unity
with
mankind
all
minds
become
transmitting
stations
through
which
he
can
work
at
will
he
added
gently
surely
this
cave
seems
familiar
to
you
as
i
maintained
a
bewildered
silence
the
saint
approached
and
struck
me
gently
on
the
forehead
at
his
magnetic
touch
a
wondrous
current
swept
through
my
brain
releasing
the
sweet
of
my
previous
life
remember
my
voice
was
with
joyous
sobs
are
my
guru
babaji
who
has
belonged
to
me
always
scenes
of
the
past
arise
vividly
in
my
mind
here
in
this
cave
i
spent
many
years
of
my
last
incarnation
as
ineffable
recollections
overwhelmed
me
i
tearfully
embraced
my
master
feet
more
than
three
decades
i
have
waited
for
you
for
you
to
return
to
me
babaji
voice
rang
with
celestial
love
slipped
away
and
vanished
into
the
tumultuous
waves
of
the
life
beyond
death
the
magic
wand
of
your
karma
touched
you
and
you
were
gone
though
you
lost
sight
of
me
never
did
i
lose
sight
of
you
i
pursued
you
over
the
luminescent
astral
sea
where
the
glorious
angels
sail
through
gloom
storm
upheaval
and
light
i
followed
you
like
a
mother
bird
guarding
her
young
as
you
lived
out
your
human
term
of
and
emerged
a
babe
my
eye
was
ever
on
you
when
you
covered
your
tiny
form
in
the
lotus
posture
under
the
nadia
sands
in
your
childhood
i
was
invisibly
present
patiently
month
after
month
year
after
year
i
have
watched
over
you
waiting
for
this
perfect
day
now
you
are
with
me
lo
here
is
your
cave
loved
of
yore
i
have
kept
it
ever
clean
and
ready
for
you
here
is
your
hallowed
where
you
daily
sat
to
fill
your
expanding
heart
with
god
behold
there
your
bowl
from
which
you
often
drank
the
nectar
prepared
by
me
see
how
i
have
kept
the
brass
cup
brightly
polished
that
you
might
drink
again
therefrom
my
own
do
you
now
understand
guru
what
can
i
say
i
murmured
brokenly
has
one
ever
heard
of
such
deathless
love
i
gazed
long
and
ecstatically
on
my
eternal
treasure
my
guru
in
life
and
death
you
need
purification
drink
the
oil
in
this
bowl
and
lie
down
by
the
river
babaji
practical
wisdom
i
reflected
with
a
quick
reminiscent
smile
was
ever
to
the
fore
i
obeyed
his
directions
though
the
icy
himalayan
night
was
descending
a
comforting
warmth
an
inner
radiation
began
to
pulsate
in
every
cell
of
my
body
i
marveled
was
the
unknown
oil
endued
with
a
cosmical
heat
bitter
winds
whipped
around
me
in
the
darkness
shrieking
a
fierce
challenge
the
chill
wavelets
of
the
gogash
river
lapped
now
and
then
over
my
body
outstretched
on
the
rocky
bank
tigers
howled
but
my
heart
was
free
of
fear
the
radiant
force
newly
generated
within
me
conveyed
an
assurance
of
unassailable
protection
several
hours
passed
swiftly
faded
memories
of
another
life
wove
themselves
into
the
present
brilliant
pattern
of
reunion
with
my
divine
guru
my
solitary
musings
were
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
in
the
darkness
a
man
hand
gently
helped
me
to
my
feet
and
gave
me
some
dry
clothing
brother
my
companion
said
master
awaits
you
he
led
the
way
through
the
forest
the
somber
night
was
suddenly
lit
by
a
steady
luminosity
in
the
distance
that
be
the
sunrise
i
inquired
the
whole
night
has
not
passed
hour
is
midnight
my
guide
laughed
softly
light
is
the
glow
of
a
golden
palace
materialized
here
tonight
by
the
peerless
babaji
in
the
dim
past
you
once
expressed
a
desire
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
a
palace
our
master
is
now
satisfying
your
wish
thus
freeing
you
from
the
bonds
of
karma
he
added
magnificent
palace
will
be
the
scene
of
your
initiation
tonight
into
kriya
yoga
all
your
brothers
here
join
in
a
paean
of
welcome
rejoicing
at
the
end
of
your
long
exile
behold
a
vast
palace
of
dazzling
gold
stood
before
us
studded
with
countless
jewels
and
set
amidst
landscaped
gardens
it
presented
a
spectacle
of
unparalleled
grandeur
saints
of
angelic
countenance
were
stationed
by
resplendent
gates
by
the
glitter
of
rubies
diamonds
pearls
sapphires
and
emeralds
of
great
size
and
luster
were
imbedded
in
the
decorative
arches
i
followed
my
companion
into
a
spacious
reception
hall
the
odor
of
incense
and
of
roses
wafted
through
the
air
dim
lamps
shed
a
multicolored
glow
small
groups
of
devotees
some
fair
some
chanted
musically
or
sat
in
the
meditative
posture
immersed
in
an
inner
peace
a
vibrant
joy
pervaded
the
atmosphere
your
eyes
enjoy
the
artistic
splendors
of
this
palace
for
it
has
been
brought
into
being
solely
in
your
honor
my
guide
smiled
sympathetically
as
i
uttered
a
few
ejaculations
of
wonderment
i
said
beauty
of
this
structure
surpasses
the
bounds
of
human
imagination
please
tell
me
the
mystery
of
its
origin
will
gladly
enlighten
you
my
companion
dark
eyes
sparkled
with
wisdom
reality
there
is
nothing
inexplicable
about
this
materialization
the
whole
cosmos
is
a
materialized
thought
of
the
creator
this
heavy
earthly
clod
floating
in
space
is
a
dream
of
god
he
made
all
things
out
of
his
consciousness
even
as
man
in
his
dream
consciousness
reproduces
and
vivifies
a
creation
with
its
creatures
first
created
the
earth
as
an
idea
then
he
quickened
it
energy
atoms
came
into
being
he
coordinated
the
atoms
into
this
solid
sphere
all
its
molecules
are
held
together
by
the
will
of
god
when
he
withdraws
his
will
the
earth
again
will
disintegrate
into
energy
energy
will
dissolve
into
consciousness
the
will
disappear
from
objectivity
substance
of
a
dream
is
held
in
materialization
by
the
subconscious
thought
of
the
dreamer
when
that
cohesive
thought
is
withdrawn
in
wakefulness
the
dream
and
its
elements
dissolve
a
man
closes
his
eyes
and
erects
a
which
on
awakening
he
effortlessly
dematerializes
he
follows
the
divine
archetypal
pattern
similarly
when
he
awakens
in
cosmic
consciousness
he
will
effortlessly
dematerialize
the
illusions
of
the
cosmic
dream
one
with
the
infinite
will
babaji
can
summon
the
elemental
atoms
to
combine
and
manifest
themselves
in
any
form
this
golden
palace
instantaneously
created
is
real
even
as
this
earth
is
real
babaji
created
this
palatial
mansion
out
of
his
mind
and
is
holding
its
atoms
together
by
the
power
of
his
will
even
as
god
created
this
earth
and
is
maintaining
it
intact
he
added
this
structure
has
served
its
purpose
babaji
will
dematerialize
it
as
i
remained
silent
in
awe
my
guide
made
a
sweeping
gesture
shimmering
palace
superbly
embellished
with
jewels
has
not
been
built
by
human
effort
or
with
laboriously
mined
gold
and
gems
it
stands
solidly
a
monumental
challenge
to
man
whoever
realizes
himself
as
a
son
of
god
even
as
babaji
has
done
can
reach
any
goal
by
the
infinite
powers
hidden
within
him
a
common
stone
locks
within
itself
the
secret
of
stupendous
atomic
energy
even
so
a
mortal
is
yet
a
powerhouse
of
divinity
the
sage
picked
up
from
a
table
a
graceful
vase
whose
handle
was
blazing
with
diamonds
great
guru
created
this
palace
by
solidifying
myriads
of
free
cosmic
rays
he
went
on
this
vase
and
its
diamonds
they
will
satisfy
all
the
tests
of
sensory
experience
i
examined
the
vase
and
passed
my
hand
over
the
smooth
thick
with
glistening
gold
each
of
the
jewels
scattered
lavishly
about
was
worthy
of
a
king
collection
deep
satisfaction
spread
over
my
mind
a
submerged
desire
hidden
in
my
subconsciousness
from
lives
now
gone
seemed
simultaneously
gratified
and
extinguished
my
stately
companion
led
me
through
ornate
arches
and
corridors
into
a
series
of
chambers
richly
furnished
in
the
style
of
an
emperor
palace
we
entered
an
immense
hall
in
the
center
stood
a
golden
throne
encrusted
with
jewels
shedding
a
dazzling
medley
of
colors
there
in
lotus
posture
sat
the
supreme
babaji
i
knelt
on
the
shining
floor
at
his
feet
are
you
still
feasting
on
your
dream
desires
for
a
golden
palace
my
guru
eyes
were
twinkling
like
his
own
sapphires
all
your
earthly
thirsts
are
about
to
be
quenched
forever
he
murmured
some
mystic
words
of
blessing
son
arise
receive
your
initiation
into
the
kingdom
of
god
through
kriya
yoga
babaji
stretched
out
his
hand
a
homa
sacrificial
fire
appeared
surrounded
by
fruits
and
flowers
i
received
the
liberating
yogic
technique
before
this
flaming
altar
the
rites
were
completed
in
the
early
dawn
i
felt
no
need
for
sleep
in
my
ecstatic
state
and
wandered
around
the
palace
filled
on
all
sides
with
treasures
and
priceless
objets
descending
to
the
gorgeous
gardens
i
noticed
the
same
caves
and
barren
mountain
ledges
which
yesterday
had
boasted
no
adjacency
to
palace
or
flowered
terrace
reentering
the
palace
fabulously
glistening
in
the
cold
himalayan
sunlight
i
sought
the
presence
of
my
master
he
was
still
enthroned
surrounded
by
many
quiet
disciples
you
are
hungry
babaji
added
your
eyes
when
i
reopened
them
the
enchanting
palace
and
its
picturesque
gardens
had
disappeared
my
own
body
and
the
forms
of
babaji
and
the
cluster
of
chelas
were
all
now
seated
on
the
bare
ground
at
the
exact
site
of
the
vanished
palace
not
far
from
the
sunlit
entrances
of
the
rocky
grottos
i
recalled
that
my
guide
had
remarked
that
the
palace
would
be
dematerialized
its
captive
atoms
released
into
the
from
which
it
had
sprung
although
stunned
i
looked
trustingly
at
my
guru
i
knew
not
what
to
expect
next
on
this
day
of
miracles
purpose
for
which
the
palace
was
created
has
now
been
served
babaji
explained
he
lifted
an
earthen
vessel
from
the
ground
your
hand
there
and
receive
whatever
food
you
desire
as
soon
as
i
touched
the
broad
empty
bowl
it
became
heaped
with
hot
luchis
curry
and
rare
sweetmeats
i
helped
myself
observing
that
the
vessel
was
at
the
end
of
my
meal
i
looked
around
for
water
my
guru
pointed
to
the
bowl
before
me
lo
the
food
had
vanished
in
its
place
was
water
clear
as
from
a
mountain
stream
mortals
know
that
the
kingdom
of
god
includes
the
kingdom
of
mundane
fulfillments
babaji
observed
divine
realm
extends
to
the
earthly
but
the
latter
being
illusory
can
not
include
the
essence
of
reality
guru
last
night
you
demonstrated
for
me
the
link
of
beauty
in
heaven
and
earth
i
smiled
at
memories
of
the
vanished
palace
surely
no
simple
yogi
had
ever
received
initiation
into
the
august
mysteries
of
spirit
amidst
surroundings
of
more
impressive
luxury
i
gazed
tranquilly
at
the
stark
contrast
of
the
present
scene
the
gaunt
ground
the
skyey
roof
the
caves
offering
primitive
seemed
a
gracious
natural
setting
for
the
seraphic
saints
around
me
i
sat
that
afternoon
on
my
blanket
hallowed
by
associations
of
realizations
my
divine
guru
approached
and
passed
his
hand
over
my
head
i
entered
the
nirbikalpa
samadhi
state
remaining
unbrokenly
in
its
bliss
for
seven
days
crossing
the
successive
strata
of
i
penetrated
the
deathless
realms
of
reality
all
delusive
limitations
dropped
away
my
soul
was
fully
established
on
the
eternal
altar
of
the
cosmic
spirit
on
the
eighth
day
i
fell
at
my
guru
feet
and
implored
him
to
keep
me
always
near
him
in
this
sacred
wilderness
son
babaji
said
embracing
me
role
in
this
incarnation
must
be
played
on
an
outward
stage
prenatally
blessed
by
many
lives
of
lonely
meditation
you
must
now
mingle
in
the
world
of
men
deep
purpose
underlay
the
fact
that
you
did
not
meet
me
this
time
until
you
were
already
a
married
man
with
modest
business
responsibilities
you
must
put
aside
your
thoughts
of
joining
our
secret
band
in
the
himalayas
your
life
lies
in
the
crowded
marts
serving
as
an
example
of
the
ideal
cries
of
many
bewildered
worldly
men
and
women
have
not
fallen
unheard
on
the
ears
of
the
great
ones
he
went
on
have
been
chosen
to
bring
spiritual
solace
through
kriya
yoga
to
numerous
earnest
seekers
the
millions
who
are
encumbered
by
family
ties
and
heavy
worldly
duties
will
take
new
heart
from
you
a
householder
like
themselves
you
must
guide
them
to
see
that
the
highest
yogic
attainments
are
not
barred
to
the
family
man
even
in
the
world
the
yogi
who
faithfully
discharges
his
responsibilities
without
personal
motive
or
attachment
treads
the
sure
path
of
enlightenment
necessity
compels
you
to
leave
the
world
for
inwardly
you
have
already
sundered
its
every
karmic
tie
not
of
this
world
you
must
yet
be
in
it
many
years
still
remain
during
which
you
must
conscientiously
fulfill
your
family
business
civic
and
spiritual
duties
a
sweet
new
breath
of
divine
hope
will
penetrate
the
arid
hearts
of
worldly
men
from
your
balanced
life
they
will
understand
that
liberation
is
dependent
on
inner
rather
than
outer
renunciations
how
remote
seemed
my
family
the
office
the
world
as
i
listened
to
my
guru
in
the
high
himalayan
solitudes
yet
adamantine
truth
rang
in
his
words
i
submissively
agreed
to
leave
this
blessed
haven
of
peace
babaji
instructed
me
in
the
ancient
rigid
rules
which
govern
the
transmission
of
the
yogic
art
from
guru
to
disciple
the
kriya
key
only
on
qualified
chelas
babaji
said
who
vows
to
sacrifice
all
in
the
quest
of
the
divine
is
fit
to
unravel
the
final
mysteries
of
life
through
the
science
of
meditation
guru
as
you
have
already
favored
mankind
by
resurrecting
the
lost
kriya
art
will
you
not
increase
that
benefit
by
relaxing
the
strict
requirements
for
discipleship
i
gazed
beseechingly
at
babaji
pray
that
you
permit
me
to
communicate
kriya
to
all
seekers
even
though
at
first
they
can
not
vow
themselves
to
complete
inner
renunciation
the
tortured
men
and
women
of
the
world
pursued
by
the
threefold
suffering
need
special
encouragement
they
may
never
attempt
the
road
to
freedom
if
kriya
initiation
be
withheld
from
them
it
so
the
divine
wish
has
been
expressed
through
you
with
these
simple
words
the
merciful
guru
banished
the
rigorous
safeguards
that
for
ages
had
hidden
kriya
from
the
world
kriya
freely
to
all
who
humbly
ask
for
help
after
a
silence
babaji
added
to
each
of
your
disciples
this
majestic
promise
from
the
bhagavad
gita
swalpamasya
dharmasya
trayata
mahato
bhoyat
even
a
little
bit
of
the
practice
of
this
religion
will
save
you
from
dire
fears
and
colossal
sufferings
as
i
knelt
the
next
morning
at
my
guru
feet
for
his
farewell
blessing
he
sensed
my
deep
reluctance
to
leave
him
is
no
separation
for
us
my
beloved
child
he
touched
my
shoulder
affectionately
you
are
whenever
you
call
me
i
shall
be
with
you
instantly
consoled
by
his
wondrous
promise
and
rich
with
the
newly
found
gold
of
i
wended
my
way
down
the
mountain
at
the
office
i
was
welcomed
by
my
fellow
employees
who
for
ten
days
had
thought
me
lost
in
the
himalayan
jungles
a
letter
soon
arrived
from
the
head
office
should
return
to
the
danapur
office
it
read
transfer
to
ranikhet
occurred
by
error
another
man
should
have
been
sent
to
assume
the
ranikhet
duties
i
smiled
reflecting
on
the
hidden
crosscurrents
in
the
events
which
had
led
me
to
this
furthermost
spot
of
india
before
returning
to
danapur
i
spent
a
few
days
with
a
bengali
family
at
moradabad
a
party
of
six
friends
gathered
to
greet
me
as
i
turned
the
conversation
to
spiritual
subjects
my
host
observed
gloomily
in
these
days
india
is
destitute
of
saints
i
protested
warmly
course
there
are
still
great
masters
in
this
land
in
a
mood
of
exalted
fervor
i
felt
impelled
to
relate
my
miraculous
experiences
in
the
himalayas
the
little
company
was
politely
incredulous
one
man
said
soothingly
mind
has
been
under
a
strain
in
those
rarefied
mountain
airs
this
is
some
daydream
you
have
recounted
burning
with
the
enthusiasm
of
truth
i
spoke
without
due
thought
i
call
him
my
guru
will
appear
right
in
this
house
interest
gleamed
in
every
eye
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
group
was
eager
to
behold
a
saint
materialized
in
such
a
strange
way
i
asked
for
a
quiet
room
and
two
new
woolen
blankets
master
will
materialize
from
the
ether
i
said
silently
outside
the
door
i
shall
soon
call
you
i
sank
into
the
meditative
state
humbly
summoning
my
guru
the
darkened
room
soon
filled
with
a
dim
aural
moonlight
the
luminous
figure
of
babaji
emerged
do
you
call
me
for
a
trifle
the
master
gaze
was
stern
is
for
earnest
seekers
not
for
those
of
idle
curiosity
it
is
easy
to
believe
when
one
sees
there
is
nothing
then
to
deny
supersensual
truth
is
deserved
and
discovered
by
those
who
overcome
their
natural
materialistic
skepticism
he
added
gravely
me
go
i
fell
entreatingly
at
his
feet
guru
i
realize
my
serious
error
i
humbly
ask
pardon
it
was
to
create
faith
in
these
spiritually
blinded
minds
that
i
ventured
to
call
you
because
you
have
graciously
appeared
at
my
prayer
please
do
not
depart
without
bestowing
a
blessing
on
my
friends
unbelievers
though
they
be
at
least
they
were
willing
to
investigate
the
truth
of
my
strange
assertions
well
i
will
stay
awhile
i
do
not
wish
your
word
discredited
before
your
friends
babaji
face
had
softened
but
he
added
gently
my
son
i
shall
come
when
you
need
me
and
not
always
when
you
call
me
tense
silence
reigned
in
the
little
group
when
i
opened
the
door
as
if
mistrusting
their
senses
my
friends
stared
at
the
lustrous
figure
on
the
blanket
seat
is
one
man
laughed
blatantly
one
could
possibly
have
entered
this
room
without
our
knowledge
babaji
advanced
smilingly
and
motioned
to
each
one
to
touch
the
warm
solid
flesh
of
his
body
doubts
dispelled
my
friends
prostrated
themselves
on
the
floor
in
awed
repentance
halua
be
prepared
babaji
made
this
request
i
knew
to
further
assure
the
group
of
his
physical
reality
while
the
porridge
was
boiling
the
divine
guru
chatted
affably
great
was
the
metamorphosis
of
these
doubting
thomases
into
devout
pauls
after
we
had
eaten
babaji
blessed
each
of
us
in
turn
there
was
a
sudden
flash
we
witnessed
the
instantaneous
dechemicalization
of
the
electronic
elements
of
babaji
body
into
a
spreading
vaporous
light
the
will
power
of
the
master
had
loosened
its
grasp
of
the
ether
atoms
held
together
as
his
body
forthwith
the
trillions
of
tiny
lifetronic
sparks
faded
into
the
infinite
reservoir
my
own
eyes
i
have
seen
the
conqueror
of
death
maitra
one
of
the
group
spoke
reverently
his
face
was
transfigured
with
the
joy
of
his
recent
awakening
supreme
guru
played
with
time
and
space
as
a
child
plays
with
bubbles
i
have
beheld
one
with
the
keys
of
heaven
and
earth
i
soon
returned
to
danapur
firmly
anchored
in
the
spirit
again
i
assumed
the
manifold
business
and
family
obligations
of
a
householder
lahiri
mahasaya
also
related
to
swami
kebalananda
and
sri
yukteswar
the
story
of
another
meeting
with
babaji
under
circumstances
which
recalled
the
guru
promise
i
shall
come
whenever
you
need
me
the
scene
was
a
kumbha
mela
at
allahabad
lahiri
mahasaya
told
his
disciples
i
had
gone
there
during
a
short
vacation
from
my
office
duties
as
i
wandered
amidst
the
throng
of
monks
and
sadhus
who
had
come
from
great
distances
to
attend
the
holy
festival
i
noticed
an
ascetic
who
was
holding
a
begging
bowl
the
thought
arose
in
my
mind
that
the
man
was
hypocritical
wearing
the
outward
symbols
of
renunciation
without
a
corresponding
inward
grace
no
sooner
had
i
passed
the
ascetic
than
my
astounded
eye
fell
on
babaji
he
was
kneeling
in
front
of
a
anchorite
i
hastened
to
his
side
what
are
you
doing
here
am
washing
the
feet
of
this
renunciate
and
then
i
shall
clean
his
cooking
utensils
babaji
smiled
at
me
like
a
little
child
i
knew
he
was
intimating
that
he
wanted
me
to
criticize
no
one
but
to
see
the
lord
as
residing
equally
in
all
whether
of
superior
or
inferior
men
the
great
guru
added
serving
wise
and
ignorant
sadhus
i
am
learning
the
greatest
of
virtues

fulfillment
desire
is
thus
the
chain
which

what
is

a

an

the
theory
of
the

structure

was
expounded
in
the

treatises
there
are
vast
worlds

placed

like
lahiri

may
suffer
from
an
excess
of
zeal
and
be
subject
to
discipline
in

the
man
maitra
to
whom
lahiri
mahasaya
is
here
referring
afterward
became
highly
advanced
in
i
met
maitra
shortly
after
my
graduation
from
high
school
he
visited
the
mahamandal
hermitage
in
benares
while
i
was
a
resident
he
told
me
then
of
babaji
materialization
before
the
group
in
moradabad
as
a
result
of
the
miracle
maitra
explained
to
me
i
became
a
lifelong
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
chapter
the
christlike
life
of
lahiri
mahasaya
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfill
all
righteousness
in
these
words
to
john
the
baptist
and
in
asking
john
to
baptize
him
jesus
was
acknowledging
the
divine
rights
of
his
guru
from
a
reverent
study
of
the
bible
from
an
oriental
viewpoint
and
from
intuitional
perception
i
am
convinced
that
john
the
baptist
was
in
past
lives
the
guru
of
christ
there
are
numerous
passages
in
the
bible
which
infer
that
john
and
jesus
in
their
last
incarnations
were
respectively
elijah
and
his
disciple
elisha
these
are
the
spellings
in
the
old
testament
the
greek
translators
spelled
the
names
as
elias
and
eliseus
they
reappear
in
the
new
testament
in
these
changed
forms
the
very
end
of
the
old
testament
is
a
prediction
of
the
reincarnation
of
elijah
and
elisha
behold
i
will
send
you
elijah
the
prophet
before
the
coming
of
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
thus
john
elijah
sent
before
the
coming
of
the
lord
was
born
slightly
earlier
to
serve
as
a
herald
for
christ
an
angel
appeared
to
zacharias
the
father
to
testify
that
his
coming
son
john
would
be
no
other
than
elijah
elias
but
the
angel
said
unto
him
fear
not
zacharias
for
thy
prayer
is
heard
and
thy
wife
elisabeth
shall
bear
thee
a
son
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
john
and
many
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
he
turn
to
the
lord
their
god
and
he
shall
go
before
him
in
the
spirit
and
power
of
elias
to
turn
the
hearts
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
and
the
disobedient
to
the
wisdom
of
the
just
to
make
ready
a
people
prepared
for
the
lord
jesus
twice
unequivocally
identified
elijah
elias
as
john
elias
is
come
already
and
they
knew
him
not
then
the
disciples
understood
that
he
spake
unto
them
of
john
the
baptist
again
christ
says
for
all
the
prophets
and
the
law
prophesied
until
john
and
if
ye
will
receive
it
this
is
elias
which
was
for
to
come
when
john
denied
that
he
was
elias
elijah
he
meant
that
in
the
humble
garb
of
john
he
came
no
longer
in
the
outward
elevation
of
elijah
the
great
guru
in
his
former
incarnation
he
had
given
the
mantle
of
his
glory
and
his
spiritual
wealth
to
his
disciple
elisha
and
elisha
said
i
pray
thee
let
a
double
portion
of
thy
spirit
be
upon
me
and
he
said
thou
hast
asked
a
hard
thing
nevertheless
if
thou
see
me
when
i
am
taken
from
thee
it
shall
be
so
unto
thee
and
he
took
the
mantle
of
elijah
that
fell
from
him
the
roles
became
reversed
because
was
no
longer
needed
to
be
the
ostensible
guru
of
now
perfected
in
divine
realization
when
christ
was
transfigured
on
the
mountain
it
was
his
guru
elias
with
moses
whom
he
saw
again
in
his
hour
of
extremity
on
the
cross
jesus
cried
out
the
divine
name
eli
eli
lama
sabachthani
that
is
to
say
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
some
of
them
that
stood
there
when
they
heard
that
said
this
man
calleth
for
elias
let
us
see
whether
elias
will
come
to
save
him
the
eternal
bond
of
guru
and
disciple
that
existed
between
john
and
jesus
was
present
also
for
babaji
and
lahiri
mahasaya
with
tender
solicitude
the
deathless
guru
swam
the
lethean
waters
that
swirled
between
the
last
two
lives
of
his
chela
and
guided
the
successive
steps
taken
by
the
child
and
then
by
the
man
lahiri
mahasaya
it
was
not
until
the
disciple
had
reached
his
year
that
babaji
deemed
the
time
to
be
ripe
to
openly
reestablish
the
link
then
after
their
brief
meeting
near
ranikhet
the
selfless
master
banished
his
disciple
from
the
little
mountain
group
releasing
him
for
an
outward
world
mission
my
son
i
shall
come
whenever
you
need
me
what
mortal
lover
can
bestow
that
infinite
promise
unknown
to
society
in
general
a
great
spiritual
renaissance
began
to
flow
from
a
remote
corner
of
benares
just
as
the
fragrance
of
flowers
can
not
be
suppressed
so
lahiri
mahasaya
quietly
living
as
an
ideal
householder
could
not
hide
his
innate
glory
slowly
from
every
part
of
india
the
sought
the
divine
nectar
of
the
liberated
master
the
english
office
superintendent
was
one
of
the
first
to
notice
a
strange
transcendental
change
in
his
employee
whom
he
endearingly
called
ecstatic
babu
sir
you
seem
sad
what
is
the
trouble
lahiri
mahasaya
made
this
sympathetic
inquiry
one
morning
to
his
employer
my
wife
in
england
is
critically
ill
i
am
torn
by
anxiety
i
shall
get
you
some
word
about
her
lahiri
mahasaya
left
the
room
and
sat
for
a
short
time
in
a
secluded
spot
on
his
return
he
smiled
consolingly
your
wife
is
improving
she
is
now
writing
you
a
letter
the
omniscient
yogi
quoted
some
parts
of
the
missive
ecstatic
babu
i
already
know
that
you
are
no
ordinary
man
yet
i
am
unable
to
believe
that
at
will
you
can
banish
time
and
space
the
promised
letter
finally
arrived
the
astounded
superintendent
found
that
it
contained
not
only
the
good
news
of
his
recovery
but
also
the
same
phrases
which
weeks
earlier
lahiri
mahasaya
had
repeated
the
wife
came
to
india
some
months
later
she
visited
the
office
where
lahiri
mahasaya
was
quietly
sitting
at
his
desk
the
woman
approached
him
reverently
sir
she
said
it
was
your
form
haloed
in
glorious
light
that
i
beheld
months
ago
by
my
sickbed
in
london
at
that
moment
i
was
completely
healed
soon
after
i
was
able
to
undertake
the
long
ocean
voyage
to
india
day
after
day
one
or
two
devotees
besought
the
sublime
guru
for
kriya
initiation
in
addition
to
these
spiritual
duties
and
to
those
of
his
business
and
family
life
the
great
master
took
an
enthusiastic
interest
in
education
he
organized
many
study
groups
and
played
an
active
part
in
the
growth
of
a
large
high
school
in
the
bengalitola
section
of
benares
his
regular
discourses
on
the
scriptures
came
to
be
called
his
gita
assembly
eagerly
attended
by
many
by
these
manifold
activities
lahiri
mahasaya
sought
to
answer
the
common
challenge
after
performing
one
business
and
social
duties
where
is
the
time
for
devotional
meditation
the
harmoniously
balanced
life
of
the
great
became
the
silent
inspiration
of
thousands
of
questioning
hearts
earning
only
a
modest
salary
thrifty
unostentatious
accessible
to
all
the
master
carried
on
naturally
and
happily
in
the
path
of
worldly
life
though
ensconced
in
the
seat
of
the
supreme
one
lahiri
mahasaya
showed
reverence
to
all
men
irrespective
of
their
differing
merits
when
his
devotees
saluted
him
he
bowed
in
turn
to
them
with
a
childlike
humility
the
master
often
touched
the
feet
of
others
but
seldom
allowed
them
to
pay
him
similar
honor
even
though
such
obeisance
toward
the
guru
is
an
ancient
oriental
custom
a
significant
feature
of
lahiri
mahasaya
life
was
his
gift
of
kriya
initiation
to
those
of
every
faith
not
hindus
only
but
moslems
and
christians
were
among
his
foremost
disciples
monists
and
dualists
those
of
all
faiths
or
of
no
established
faith
were
impartially
received
and
instructed
by
the
universal
guru
one
of
his
highly
advanced
chelas
was
abdul
gufoor
khan
a
mohammedan
it
shows
great
courage
on
the
part
of
lahiri
mahasaya
that
although
a
brahmin
he
tried
his
utmost
to
dissolve
the
rigid
caste
bigotry
of
his
time
those
from
every
walk
of
life
found
shelter
under
the
master
omnipresent
wings
like
all
prophets
lahiri
mahasaya
gave
new
hope
to
the
outcastes
and
of
society
always
remember
that
you
belong
to
no
one
and
no
one
belongs
to
you
reflect
that
some
day
you
will
suddenly
have
to
leave
everything
in
this
make
the
acquaintanceship
of
god
now
the
great
guru
told
his
disciples
prepare
yourself
for
the
coming
astral
journey
of
death
by
daily
riding
in
the
balloon
of
through
delusion
you
are
perceiving
yourself
as
a
bundle
of
flesh
and
bones
which
at
best
is
a
nest
of
troubles
meditate
unceasingly
that
you
may
quickly
behold
yourself
as
the
infinite
essence
free
from
every
form
of
misery
cease
being
a
prisoner
of
the
body
using
the
secret
key
of
kriya
learn
to
escape
into
spirit
the
great
guru
encouraged
his
various
students
to
adhere
to
the
good
traditional
discipline
of
their
own
faith
stressing
the
nature
of
kriya
as
a
practical
technique
of
liberation
lahiri
mahasaya
then
gave
his
chelas
liberty
to
express
their
lives
in
conformance
with
environment
and
up
bringing
a
moslem
should
perform
his
namaj
worship
four
times
daily
the
master
pointed
out
four
times
daily
a
hindu
should
sit
in
meditation
a
christian
should
go
down
on
his
knees
four
times
daily
praying
to
god
and
then
reading
the
bible
with
wise
discernment
the
guru
guided
his
followers
into
the
paths
of
bhakti
devotion
karma
action
jnana
wisdom
or
raja
royal
or
complete
yogas
according
to
each
man
natural
tendencies
the
master
who
was
slow
to
give
his
permission
to
devotees
wishing
to
enter
the
formal
path
of
monkhood
always
cautioned
them
to
first
reflect
well
on
the
austerities
of
the
monastic
life
the
great
guru
taught
his
disciples
to
avoid
theoretical
discussion
of
the
scriptures
he
only
is
wise
who
devotes
himself
to
realizing
not
reading
only
the
ancient
revelations
he
said
solve
all
your
problems
through
meditation
exchange
unprofitable
religious
speculations
for
actual
clear
your
mind
of
dogmatic
theological
debris
let
in
the
fresh
healing
waters
of
direct
perception
attune
yourself
to
the
active
inner
guidance
the
divine
voice
has
the
answer
to
every
dilemma
of
life
though
man
ingenuity
for
getting
himself
into
trouble
appears
to
be
endless
the
infinite
succor
is
no
less
resourceful
illustration
lahiri
mahasaya
disciple
of
babaji
and
guru
of
sri
yukteswar
see
the
master
omnipresence
was
demonstrated
one
day
before
a
group
of
disciples
who
were
listening
to
his
exposition
of
the
bhagavad
gita
as
he
was
explaining
the
meaning
of
kutastha
chaitanya
or
the
christ
consciousness
in
all
vibratory
creation
lahiri
mahasaya
suddenly
gasped
and
cried
out
i
am
drowning
in
the
bodies
of
many
souls
off
the
coast
of
japan
the
next
morning
the
chelas
read
a
newspaper
account
of
the
death
of
many
people
whose
ship
had
foundered
the
preceding
day
near
japan
the
distant
disciples
of
lahiri
mahasaya
were
often
made
aware
of
his
enfolding
presence
i
am
ever
with
those
who
practice
kriya
he
said
consolingly
to
chelas
who
could
not
remain
near
him
i
will
guide
you
to
the
cosmic
home
through
your
enlarging
perceptions
swami
satyananda
was
told
by
a
devotee
that
unable
to
go
to
benares
the
man
had
nevertheless
received
precise
kriya
initiation
in
a
dream
lahiri
mahasaya
had
appeared
to
instruct
the
chela
in
answer
to
his
prayers
if
a
disciple
neglected
any
of
his
worldly
obligations
the
master
would
gently
correct
and
discipline
him
lahiri
mahasaya
words
were
mild
and
healing
even
when
he
was
forced
to
speak
openly
of
a
chela
faults
sri
yukteswar
once
told
me
he
added
ruefully
no
disciple
ever
fled
from
our
barbs
i
could
not
help
laughing
but
i
truthfully
assured
sri
yukteswar
that
sharp
or
not
his
every
word
was
music
to
my
ears
lahiri
mahasaya
carefully
graded
kriya
into
four
progressive
initiations
he
bestowed
the
three
higher
techniques
only
after
the
devotee
had
manifested
definite
spiritual
progress
one
day
a
certain
chela
convinced
that
his
worth
was
not
being
duly
evaluated
gave
voice
to
his
discontent
master
he
said
surely
i
am
ready
now
for
the
second
initiation
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
to
admit
a
humble
disciple
brinda
bhagat
he
was
a
benares
postman
brinda
sit
by
me
here
the
great
guru
smiled
at
him
affectionately
tell
me
are
you
ready
for
the
second
technique
of
kriya
the
little
postman
folded
his
hands
in
supplication
gurudeva
he
said
in
alarm
no
more
initiations
please
how
can
i
assimilate
any
higher
teachings
i
have
come
today
to
ask
your
blessings
because
the
first
divine
kriya
has
filled
me
with
such
intoxication
that
i
can
not
deliver
my
letters

in

at
these

his
other
disciple
hung
his
head
master
he
said
i
see
i
have
been
a
poor
workman
finding
fault
with
my
tools
the
postman
who
was
an
uneducated
man
later
developed
his
insight
through
kriya
to
such
an
extent
that
scholars
occasionally
sought
his
interpretation
on
involved
scriptural
points
innocent
alike
of
sin
and
syntax

brinda
won
renown
in
the
domain
of
learned
pundits
besides
the
numerous
benares
disciples
of
lahiri
mahasaya
hundreds
came
to
him
from
distant
parts
of
india
he
himself
traveled
to
bengal
on
several
occasions
visiting
at
the
homes
of
the
of
his
two
sons
thus
blessed
by
his
presence
bengal
became
honeycombed
with
small
kriya
groups
particularly
in
the
districts
of
krishnagar
and
bishnupur
many
silent
devotees
to
this
day
have
kept
the
invisible
current
of
spiritual
meditation
flowing
among
many
saints
who
received
kriya
from
lahiri
mahasaya
may
be
mentioned
the
illustrious
swami
vhaskarananda
saraswati
of
benares

the
deogarh

the
maharaja
as

as
his

initiation
as
did
the
maharaja
jotindra
mohan
thakur
a
number
of
lahiri
mahasaya
disciples
with
influential
worldly
position
were
desirous
of
expanding
the
kriya
circle
by
publicity
the
guru
refused
his
permission
one
chela
the
royal
physician
to
the
lord
of
benares
started
an
organized
effort
to
spread
the
master
name
as
kashi
baba
exalted
one
of
benares
again
the
guru
forbade
it
let
the
fragrance
of
the
kriya
flower
be
wafted
naturally
without
any
display
he
said
its
seeds
will
take
root
in
the
soil
of
spiritually
fertile
hearts
although
the
great
master
did
not
adopt
the
system
of
preaching
through
the
modern
medium
of
an
organization
or
through
the
printing
press
he
knew
that
the
power
of
his
message
would
rise
like
a
resistless
flood
inundating
by
its
own
force
the
banks
of
human
minds
the
changed
and
purified
lives
of
devotees
were
the
simple
guarantees
of
the
deathless
vitality
of
kriya
in
years
after
his
ranikhet
initiation
lahiri
mahasaya
was
retired
on
a
pension
with
his
availability
in
the
daytime
disciples
sought
him
out
in
numbers
the
great
guru
now
sat
in
silence
most
of
the
time
locked
in
the
tranquil
lotus
posture
he
seldom
left
his
little
parlor
even
for
a
walk
or
to
visit
other
parts
of
the
house
a
quiet
stream
of
chelas
arrived
almost
ceaselessly
for
a
darshan
holy

of
the
guru
to
the

of
all

no

departed
without
upliftment
of
spirit
all
knew
they
had
received
the
silent
blessing
of
a
true
man
of
god
the
master
now
permitted
his
disciple
panchanon
bhattacharya
to
open
an
arya
mission
institution
in
calcutta
here
the
saintly
disciple
spread
the
message
of
kriya
yoga
and
prepared
for
public
benefit
certain
yogic
herbal
medicines
in
accordance
with
ancient
custom
the
master
gave
to
people
in
general
a
neem
oil
for
the
cure
of
various
diseases
when
the
guru
requested
a
disciple
to
distil
the
oil
he
could
easily
accomplish
the
task
if
anyone
else
tried
he
would
encounter
strange
difficulties
finding
that
the
medicinal
oil
had
almost
evaporated
after
going
through
the
required
distilling
processes
evidently
the
master
blessing
was
a
necessary
ingredient

his
penetrating
interpretations
were
recorded

arranged
by
various
disciples
some
of

were

have
lost
a
science
which
the
east
has
preserved
with
superhuman
patience
after
a
quest
of
thousands
of
years
of
experiment
it
was
the
commentaries
of
lahiri
mahasaya
which
brought
to
light
clear
of
allegories
the
very
science
of
religion
that
had
been
so
cleverly
put
out
of
sight
in
the
riddle
of
scriptural
letters
and
imagery
no
longer
a
mere
unintelligible
jugglery
of
words
the
otherwise
unmeaning
formulas
of
vedic
worship
have
been
proved
by
the
master
to
be
full
of
scientific
significance
we
know
that
man
is
usually
helpless
against
the
insurgent
sway
of
evil
passions
but
these
are
rendered
powerless
and
man
finds
no
motive
in
their
indulgence
when
there
dawns
on
him
a
consciousness
of
superior
and
lasting
bliss
through
kriya
here
the
the
negation
of
the
lower
passions
synchronizes
with
a
the
assertion
of
a
beatitude
without
such
a
course
hundreds
of
moral
maxims
which
run
in
mere
negatives
are
useless
to
us
our
eagerness
for
worldly
activity
kills
in
us
the
sense
of
spiritual
awe
we
can
not
comprehend
the
great
life
behind
all
names
and
forms
just
because
science
brings
home
to
us
how
we
can
use
the
powers
of
nature
this
familiarity
has
bred
a
contempt
for
her
ultimate
secrets
our
relation
with
nature
is
one
of
practical
business
we
tease
her
so
to
speak
to
know
how
she
can
be
used
to
serve
our
purposes
we
make
use
of
her
energies
whose
source
yet
remains
unknown
in
science
our
relation
with
nature
is
one
that
exists
between
a
man
and
his
servant
or
in
a
philosophical
sense
she
is
like
a
captive
in
the
witness
box
we
her
challenge
her
and
minutely
weigh
her
evidence
in
human
scales
which
can
not
measure
her
hidden
values
on
the
other
hand
when
the
self
is
in
communion
with
a
higher
power
nature
automatically
obeys
without
stress
or
strain
the
will
of
man
this
effortless
command
over
nature
is
called
by
the
uncomprehending
materialist
the
life
of
lahiri
mahasaya
set
an
example
which
changed
the
erroneous
notion
that
yoga
is
a
mysterious
practice
every
man
may
find
a
way
through
kriya
to
understand
his
proper
relation
with
nature
and
to
feel
spiritual
reverence
for
all
phenomena
whether
mystical
or
of
everyday
occurrence
in
spite
of
the
of
physical
science
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
what
was
mystical
a
thousand
years
ago
is
no
longer
so
and
what
is
mysterious
now
may
become
lawfully
intelligible
a
hundred
years
hence
it
is
the
infinite
the
ocean
of
power
that
is
at
the
back
of
all
manifestations
the
law
of
kriya
yoga
is
eternal
it
is
true
like
mathematics
like
the
simple
rules
of
addition
and
subtraction
the
law
of
kriya
can
never
be
destroyed
burn
to
ashes
all
the
books
on
mathematics
the
will
always
rediscover
such
truths
destroy
all
the
sacred
books
on
yoga
its
fundamental
laws
will
come
out
whenever
there
appears
a
true
yogi
who
comprises
within
himself
pure
devotion
and
consequently
pure
knowledge
just
as
babaji
is
among
the
greatest
of
avatars
a
mahavatar
and
sri
yukteswar
a
jnanavatar
or
incarnation
of
wisdom
so
lahiri
mahasaya
may
justly
be
called
yogavatar
or
incarnation
of
yoga
by
the
standards
of
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
good
he
elevated
the
spiritual
level
of
society
in
his
power
to
raise
his
close
disciples
to
christlike
stature
and
in
his
wide
dissemination
of
truth
among
the
masses
lahiri
mahasaya
ranks
among
the
saviors
of
mankind
his
uniqueness
as
a
prophet
lies
in
his
practical
stress
on
a
definite
method
kriya
opening
for
the
first
time
the
doors
of
yoga
freedom
to
all
men
apart
from
the
miracles
of
his
own
life
surely
the
yogavatar
reached
the
zenith
of
all
wonders
in
reducing
the
ancient
complexities
of
yoga
to
an
effective
simplicity
not
beyond
the
ordinary
grasp
in
reference
to
miracles
lahiri
mahasaya
often
said
the
operation
of
subtle
laws
which
are
unknown
to
people
in
general
should
not
be
publicly
discussed
or
published
without
due
discrimination
if
in
these
pages
i
have
appeared
to
flout
his
cautionary
words
it
is
because
he
has
given
me
an
inward
reassurance
also
in
recording
the
lives
of
babaji
lahiri
mahasaya
and
sri
yukteswar
i
have
thought
it
advisable
to
omit
many
true
miraculous
stories
which
could
hardly
have
been
included
without
writing
also
an
explanatory
volume
of
abstruse
philosophy
new
hope
for
new
men
divine
union
the
yogavatar
proclaimed
is
possible
through
and
is
not
dependent
on
theological
beliefs
or
on
the
arbitrary
will
of
a
cosmic
dictator
through
use
of
the
kriya
key
persons
who
can
not
bring
themselves
to
believe
in
the
divinity
of
any
man
will
behold
at
last
the
full
divinity
of
their
own
selves
matthew
many
biblical
passages
reveal
that
the
law
of
reincarnation
was
understood
and
accepted
reincarnational
cycles
are
a
more
reasonable
explanation
for
the
different
states
of
evolution
in
which
mankind
is
found
than
the
common
western
theory
which
assumes
that
something
consciousness
of
egoity
came
out
of
nothing
existed
with
varying
degrees
of
lustihood
for
thirty
or
ninety
years
and
then
returned
to
the
original
void
the
inconceivable
nature
of
such
a
void

the
inference
that
even
at
that
time
some
of
the
rudiments

were
already
known
we
may
not
unreasonably
draw
the
conclusion
that
systematic
introspection
with
the
aid
of
studied
methods
has
been
practiced
in
india
for
five
thousand
years
india
has
developed
certain
valuable
religious
attitudes

mind
and
ethical
notions
which
are
unique
at
least
in
the
wideness
of
their
application
to

one
of
these
has
been
a
tolerance
in
questions

is
amazing
to
the

for
many
centuries
was
common
and
bloody
wars
between
nations

were
frequent

interest
in

master
did
you
ever
meet
babaji
it
was
a
calm
summer
night
in
serampore
the
large
stars
of
the
tropics
gleamed
over
our
heads
as
i
sat
by
sri
yukteswar
side
on
the
balcony
of
the
hermitage
yes
master
smiled
at
my
direct
question
his
eyes
lit
with
reverence
three
times
i
have
been
blessed
by
the
sight
of
the
deathless
guru
our
first
meeting
was
in
allahabad
at
a
kumbha
mela
the
religious
fairs
held
in
india
since
time
immemorial
are
known
as
kumbha
melas
they
have
kept
spiritual
goals
in
constant
sight
of
the
multitude
devout
hindus
gather
by
the
millions
every
six
years
to
meet
thousands
of
sadhus
yogis
swamis
and
ascetics
of
all
kinds
many
are
hermits
who
never
leave
their
secluded
haunts
except
to
attend
the
melas
and
bestow
their
blessings
on
worldly
men
and
women
i
was
not
a
swami
at
the
time
i
met
babaji
sri
yukteswar
went
on
but
i
had
already
received
kriya
initiation
from
lahiri
mahasaya
he
encouraged
me
to
attend
the
mela
which
was
convening
in
january
at
allahabad
it
was
my
first
experience
of
a
kumbha
i
felt
slightly
dazed
by
the
clamor
and
surge
of
the
crowd
in
my
searching
gazes
around
i
saw
no
illumined
face
of
a
master
passing
a
bridge
on
the
bank
of
the
ganges
i
noticed
an
acquaintance
standing
his
begging
bowl
extended
this
fair
is
nothing
but
a
chaos
of
noise
and
beggars
i
thought
in
disillusionment
wonder
if
western
scientists
patiently
enlarging
the
realms
of
knowledge
for
the
practical
good
of
mankind
are
not
more
pleasing
to
god
than
these
idlers
who
profess
religion
but
concentrate
on
alms
my
smouldering
reflections
on
social
reform
were
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
a
tall
sannyasi
who
halted
before
me
he
said
saint
is
calling
you
is
he
and
see
for
yourself
hesitantly
following
this
laconic
advice
i
soon
found
myself
near
a
tree
whose
branches
were
sheltering
a
guru
with
an
attractive
group
of
disciples
the
master
a
bright
unusual
figure
with
sparkling
dark
eyes
rose
at
my
approach
and
embraced
me
swamiji
he
said
affectionately
i
replied
emphatically
am
not
a
swami
on
whom
i
am
divinely
directed
to
bestow
the
title
of
swami
never
cast
it
off
the
saint
addressed
me
simply
but
deep
conviction
of
truth
rang
in
his
words
i
was
engulfed
in
an
instant
wave
of
spiritual
blessing
smiling
at
my
sudden
elevation
into
the
ancient
monastic
order
i
bowed
at
the
feet
of
the
obviously
great
and
angelic
being
in
human
form
who
had
thus
honored
me
it
was
indeed
me
to
a
seat
near
him
under
the
tree
he
was
strong
and
young
and
looked
like
lahiri
mahasaya
yet
the
resemblance
did
not
strike
me
even
though
i
had
often
heard
of
the
extraordinary
similarities
in
the
appearance
of
the
two
masters
babaji
possesses
a
power
by
which
he
can
prevent
any
specific
thought
from
arising
in
a
person
mind
evidently
the
great
guru
wished
me
to
be
perfectly
natural
in
his
presence
not
overawed
by
knowledge
of
his
identity
do
you
think
of
the
kumbha
mela
was
greatly
disappointed
sir
i
added
hastily
until
the
time
i
met
you
somehow
saints
and
this
commotion
do
seem
to
belong
together
the
master
said
though
apparently
i
was
nearly
twice
his
own
age
the
faults
of
the
many
judge
not
the
whole
everything
on
earth
is
of
mixed
character
like
a
mingling
of
sand
and
sugar
be
like
the
wise
ant
which
seizes
only
the
sugar
and
leaves
the
sand
untouched
though
many
sadhus
here
still
wander
in
delusion
yet
the
mela
is
blessed
by
a
few
men
of
in
view
of
my
own
meeting
with
this
exalted
master
i
quickly
agreed
with
his
observation
i
commented
have
been
thinking
of
the
scientific
men
of
the
west
greater
by
far
in
intelligence
than
most
people
congregated
here
living
in
distant
europe
and
america
professing
different
creeds
and
ignorant
of
the
real
values
of
such
melas
as
the
present
one
they
are
the
men
who
could
benefit
greatly
by
meetings
with
india
masters
but
although
high
in
intellectual
attainments
many
westerners
are
wedded
to
rank
materialism
others
famous
in
science
and
philosophy
do
not
recognize
the
essential
unity
in
religion
their
creeds
serve
as
insurmountable
barriers
that
threaten
to
separate
them
from
us
forever
saw
that
you
are
interested
in
the
west
as
well
as
the
east
babaji
face
beamed
with
approval
felt
the
pangs
of
your
heart
broad
enough
for
all
men
whether
oriental
or
occidental
that
is
why
i
summoned
you
here
and
west
must
establish
a
golden
middle
path
of
activity
and
spirituality
combined
he
continued
has
much
to
learn
from
the
west
in
material
development
in
return
india
can
teach
the
universal
methods
by
which
the
west
will
be
able
to
base
its
religious
beliefs
on
the
unshakable
foundations
of
yogic
science
swamiji
have
a
part
to
play
in
the
coming
harmonious
exchange
between
orient
and
occident
some
years
hence
i
shall
send
you
a
disciple
whom
you
can
train
for
yoga
dissemination
in
the
west
the
vibrations
there
of
many
spiritually
seeking
souls
come
floodlike
to
me
i
perceive
potential
saints
in
america
and
europe
waiting
to
be
awakened
at
this
point
in
his
story
sri
yukteswar
turned
his
gaze
fully
on
mine
my
son
he
said
smiling
in
the
moonlight
you
are
the
disciple
that
years
ago
babaji
promised
to
send
me
i
was
happy
to
learn
that
babaji
had
directed
my
steps
to
sri
yukteswar
yet
it
was
hard
for
me
to
visualize
myself
in
the
remote
west
away
from
my
beloved
guru
and
the
simple
hermitage
peace
babaji
then
spoke
of
the
bhagavad
gita
sri
yukteswar
went
on
to
my
astonishment
he
indicated
by
a
few
words
of
praise
that
he
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
had
written
interpretations
on
various
gita
chapters
my
request
swamiji
please
undertake
another
task
the
great
master
said
you
not
write
a
short
book
on
the
underlying
basic
unity
between
the
christian
and
hindu
scriptures
show
by
parallel
references
that
the
inspired
sons
of
god
have
spoken
the
same
truths
now
obscured
by
men
sectarian
differences
i
answered
diffidently
a
command
shall
i
be
able
to
fulfill
it
babaji
laughed
softly
son
why
do
you
doubt
he
said
reassuringly
whose
work
is
all
this
and
who
is
the
doer
of
all
actions
whatever
the
lord
has
made
me
say
is
bound
to
materialize
as
truth
i
deemed
myself
empowered
by
the
blessings
of
the
saint
and
agreed
to
write
the
book
feeling
reluctantly
that
the
had
arrived
i
rose
from
my
leafy
seat
you
know
lahiri
the
master
inquired
is
a
great
soul
is
he
tell
him
of
our
meeting
he
then
gave
me
a
message
for
lahiri
mahasaya
after
i
had
bowed
humbly
in
farewell
the
saint
smiled
benignly
your
book
is
finished
i
shall
pay
you
a
visit
he
promised
for
the
present
i
left
allahabad
the
following
day
and
entrained
for
benares
reaching
my
guru
home
i
poured
out
the
story
of
the
wonderful
saint
at
the
kumbha
mela
did
you
recognize
him
lahiri
mahasaya
eyes
were
dancing
with
laughter
see
you
could
for
he
prevented
you
he
is
my
incomparable
guru
the
celestial
babaji
i
repeated
awestruck
babaji
the
savior
babaji
oh
if
i
could
just
recall
the
past
and
be
once
more
in
his
presence
to
show
my
devotion
at
his
lotus
feet
mind
lahiri
mahasaya
said
consolingly
has
promised
to
see
you
again
the
divine
master
asked
me
to
give
you
a
message
tell
lahiri
he
said
that
the
power
for
this
life
now
runs
low
it
is
nearly
finished
at
my
utterance
of
these
enigmatic
words
lahiri
mahasaya
figure
trembled
as
though
touched
by
a
lightning
current
in
an
instant
everything
about
him
fell
silent
his
smiling
countenance
turned
incredibly
stern
like
a
wooden
statue
somber
and
immovable
in
its
seat
his
body
became
colorless
i
was
alarmed
and
bewildered
never
in
my
life
had
i
seen
this
joyous
soul
manifest
such
awful
gravity
the
other
disciples
present
stared
apprehensively
three
hours
passed
in
utter
silence
then
lahiri
mahasaya
resumed
his
natural
cheerful
demeanor
and
spoke
affectionately
to
each
of
the
chelas
everyone
sighed
in
relief
i
realized
by
my
master
reaction
that
babaji
message
had
been
an
unmistakable
signal
by
which
lahiri
mahasaya
understood
that
his
body
would
soon
be
untenanted
his
awesome
silence
proved
that
my
guru
had
instantly
controlled
his
being
cut
his
last
cord
of
attachment
to
the
material
world
and
fled
to
his
identity
in
spirit
babaji
remark
had
been
his
way
of
saying
shall
be
ever
with
you
though
babaji
and
lahiri
mahasaya
were
omniscient
and
had
no
need
of
communicating
with
each
other
through
me
or
any
other
intermediary
the
great
ones
often
condescend
to
play
a
part
in
the
human
drama
occasionally
they
transmit
their
prophecies
through
messengers
in
an
ordinary
way
that
the
final
fulfillment
of
their
words
may
infuse
greater
divine
faith
in
a
wide
circle
of
men
who
later
learn
the
story
i
soon
left
benares
and
set
to
work
in
serampore
on
the
scriptural
writings
requested
by
babaji
sri
yukteswar
continued
no
sooner
had
i
begun
my
task
than
i
was
able
to
compose
a
poem
dedicated
to
the
deathless
guru
the
melodious
lines
flowed
effortlessly
from
my
pen
though
never
before
had
i
attempted
sanskrit
poetry
in
the
quiet
of
night
i
busied
myself
over
a
comparison
of
the
bible
and
the
scriptures
of
sanatan
dharma
quoting
the
words
of
the
blessed
lord
jesus
i
showed
that
his
teachings
were
in
essence
one
with
the
revelations
of
the
vedas
to
my
relief
my
book
was
finished
in
a
short
time
i
realized
that
this
speedy
blessing
was
due
to
the
grace
of
my
the
chapters
first
appeared
in
the
sadhusambad
journal
later
they
were
privately
printed
as
a
book
by
one
of
my
kidderpore
disciples
the
morning
after
i
had
concluded
my
literary
efforts
master
continued
i
went
to
the
rai
ghat
here
to
bathe
in
the
ganges
the
ghat
was
deserted
i
stood
still
for
awhile
enjoying
the
sunny
peace
after
a
dip
in
the
sparkling
waters
i
started
for
home
the
only
sound
in
the
silence
was
that
of
my
cloth
with
every
step
as
i
passed
beyond
the
site
of
the
large
banyan
tree
near
the
river
bank
a
strong
impulse
urged
me
to
look
back
there
under
the
shade
of
the
banyan
and
surrounded
by
a
few
disciples
sat
the
great
babaji
swamiji
the
beautiful
voice
of
the
master
rang
out
to
assure
me
i
was
not
dreaming
see
you
have
successfully
completed
your
book
as
i
promised
i
am
here
to
thank
you
with
a
heart
i
prostrated
myself
fully
at
his
feet
i
said
imploringly
you
and
your
chelas
not
honor
my
home
with
your
presence
the
supreme
guru
smilingly
declined
child
he
said
are
people
who
like
the
shelter
of
trees
this
spot
is
quite
comfortable
tarry
awhile
master
i
gazed
entreatingly
at
him
shall
be
back
at
once
with
some
special
sweetmeats
when
i
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
dish
of
delicacies
lo
the
lordly
banyan
no
longer
sheltered
the
celestial
troupe
i
searched
all
around
the
ghat
but
in
my
heart
i
knew
the
little
band
had
already
fled
on
etheric
wings
i
was
deeply
hurt
if
we
meet
again
i
would
not
care
to
talk
to
him
i
assured
myself
was
unkind
to
leave
me
so
suddenly
this
was
a
wrath
of
love
of
course
and
nothing
more
a
few
months
later
i
visited
lahiri
mahasaya
in
benares
as
i
entered
his
little
parlor
my
guru
smiled
in
greeting
yukteswar
he
said
you
just
meet
babaji
at
the
threshold
of
my
room
no
i
answered
in
surprise
here
lahiri
mahasaya
touched
me
gently
on
the
forehead
at
once
i
beheld
near
the
door
the
form
of
babaji
blooming
like
a
perfect
lotus
i
remembered
my
old
hurt
and
did
not
bow
lahiri
mahasaya
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
the
divine
guru
gazed
at
me
with
fathomless
eyes
are
annoyed
with
me
why
should
i
be
i
answered
of
the
air
you
came
with
your
magic
group
and
into
the
thin
air
you
vanished
told
you
i
would
see
you
but
did
say
how
long
i
would
remain
babaji
laughed
softly
were
full
of
excitement
i
assure
you
that
i
was
fairly
extinguished
in
the
ether
by
the
gust
of
your
restlessness
i
was
instantly
satisfied
by
this
unflattering
explanation
i
knelt
at
his
feet
the
supreme
guru
patted
me
kindly
on
the
shoulder
you
must
meditate
more
he
said
gaze
is
not
yet
could
not
see
me
hiding
behind
the
sunlight
with
these
words
in
the
voice
of
a
celestial
flute
babaji
disappeared
into
the
hidden
radiance
that
was
one
of
my
last
visits
to
benares
to
see
my
guru
sri
yukteswar
concluded
even
as
babaji
had
foretold
at
the
kumbha
mela
the
of
lahiri
mahasaya
was
drawing
to
a
close
during
the
summer
of
his
stalwart
body
developed
a
small
boil
on
the
back
he
protested
against
lancing
he
was
working
out
in
his
own
flesh
the
evil
karma
of
some
of
his
disciples
finally
a
few
chelas
became
very
insistent
the
master
replied
cryptically
body
has
to
find
a
cause
to
go
i
will
be
agreeable
to
whatever
you
want
to
do
a
short
time
later
the
incomparable
guru
gave
up
his
body
in
benares
no
longer
need
i
seek
him
out
in
his
little
parlor
i
find
every
day
of
my
life
blessed
by
his
omnipresent
guidance
years
later
from
the
lips
of
swami
keshabananda
an
advanced
disciple
i
heard
many
wonderful
details
about
the
passing
of
lahiri
mahasaya
a
few
days
before
my
guru
relinquished
his
body
keshabananda
told
me
he
materialized
himself
before
me
as
i
sat
in
my
hermitage
at
hardwar
at
once
to
benares
with
these
words
lahiri
mahasaya
vanished
i
entrained
immediately
for
benares
at
my
guru
home
i
found
many
disciples
assembled
for
hours
that
day
the
master
expounded
the
gita
then
he
addressed
us
simply
am
going
home
sobs
of
anguish
broke
out
like
an
irresistible
torrent
comforted
i
shall
rise
again
after
this
utterance
lahiri
mahasaya
thrice
turned
his
body
around
in
a
circle
faced
the
north
in
his
lotus
posture
and
gloriously
entered
the
final
lahiri
mahasaya
beautiful
body
so
dear
to
the
devotees
was
cremated
with
solemn
householder
rites
at
manikarnika
ghat
by
the
holy
ganges
keshabananda
continued
the
following
day
at
ten
in
the
morning
while
i
was
still
in
benares
my
room
was
suffused
with
a
great
light
lo
before
me
stood
the
flesh
and
blood
form
of
lahiri
mahasaya
it
looked
exactly
like
his
old
body
except
that
it
appeared
younger
and
more
radiant
my
divine
guru
spoke
to
me
he
said
is
i
from
the
disintegrated
atoms
of
my
cremated
body
i
have
resurrected
a
remodeled
form
my
householder
work
in
the
world
is
done
but
i
do
not
leave
the
earth
entirely
henceforth
i
shall
spend
some
time
with
babaji
in
the
himalayas
and
with
babaji
in
the
cosmos
with
a
few
words
of
blessing
to
me
the
transcendent
master
vanished
wondrous
inspiration
filled
my
heart
i
was
uplifted
in
spirit
even
as
were
the
disciples
of
christ
and
kabir
when
they
had
gazed
on
their
living
gurus
after
physical
death
when
i
returned
to
my
isolated
hardwar
hermitage
keshabananda
went
on
i
carried
with
me
the
sacred
ashes
of
my
guru
i
know
he
has
escaped
the
cage
the
bird
of
omnipresence
is
freed
yet
it
comforted
my
heart
to
enshrine
his
sacred
remains
another
disciple
who
was
blessed
by
the
sight
of
his
resurrected
guru
was
the
saintly
panchanon
bhattacharya
founder
of
the
calcutta
arya
mission
institution
i
visited
panchanon
at
his
calcutta
home
and
listened
with
delight
to
the
story
of
his
many
years
with
the
master
in
conclusion
he
told
me
of
the
most
marvelous
event
in
his
life
here
in
calcutta
panchanon
said
at
ten
of
the
morning
which
followed
his
cremation
lahiri
mahasaya
appeared
before
me
in
living
glory
swami
pranabananda
the
saint
with
two
bodies
also
confided
to
me
the
details
of
his
own
supernal
experience
a
few
days
before
lahiri
mahasaya
left
his
body
pranabananda
told
me
at
the
time
he
visited
my
ranchi
school
i
received
a
letter
from
him
requesting
me
to
come
at
once
to
benares
i
was
delayed
however
and
could
not
leave
immediately
as
i
was
in
the
midst
of
my
travel
preparations
about
ten
in
the
morning
i
was
suddenly
overwhelmed
with
joy
to
see
the
shining
figure
of
my
guru
hurry
to
benares
lahiri
mahasaya
said
smiling
shall
find
me
there
no
longer
as
the
import
of
his
words
dawned
on
me
i
sobbed
believing
that
i
was
seeing
him
only
in
a
vision
the
master
approached
me
comfortingly
touch
my
flesh
he
said
am
living
as
always
do
not
lament
am
i
not
with
you
forever
from
the
lips
of
these
three
great
disciples
a
story
of
wondrous
truth
has
emerged
at
the
morning
hour
of
ten
on
the
day
after
the
body
of
lahiri
mahasaya
had
been
consigned
to
the
flames
the
resurrected
master
in
a
real
but
transfigured
body
appeared
before
three
disciples
each
one
in
a
different
city
so
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
the
saying
that
is
written
death
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
sri

later
formally
initiated
into
the

refers
to
his
own
disciple
simply
by
his
name
omitting
any
title
thus
babaji
said
lahiri
not
lahiri
mahasaya
literally
eternal
religion
the
name
given
to
the
body
of
vedic
teachings
sanatan
dharma
has
come
to
be
called
hinduism
since
the
time
of
the
greeks
who
designated
the
people
on
the
banks
of
the
river
indus
as
indoos
or
hindus
the
word
hindu
properly
speaking
refers
only
to
followers
of
sanatan

or
hinduism
the
term
indian
applies
equally
to
hindus
and
mohammedans
and
other
inhabitants
of
the

of
india
and
also
through
the
confusing
geographical
error
of
columbus
to
the
american
mongoloid
aboriginals
the
ancient
name
for
india
is

noble
the
later
ethnological
misuse
of
aryan
to
signify

spiritual
but
physical
characteristics
led
the
great

to
say
quaintly
to
me
an
ethnologist
who
speaks
of
an
aryan
race
aryan

and

as

my
visit
to
keshabananda
ashram
is
described
on
pp
september
is
the
date
on
which
lahiri
mahasaya
left
his
body
in
a
few
more
days
he
would
have
reached
his
birthday
facing
the
north
and
thrice
revolving
the
body
are
parts
of
a
vedic
rite
used
by
masters
who
know
beforehand
when
the
final
hour
is
about
to
strike
for
the
physical
body
the
last
meditation
during
which
the
master
merges
himself
in
the
cosmic
aum
is
called
the
maha
or
great
samadhi
kabir
was
a
great
saint
whose
large
following
included
both
hindus
and
mohammedans
at
the
time
of
his
death
the
disciples
quarreled
over
the
manner
of
conducting
the
funeral
ceremonies
the
exasperated
master
rose
from
his
final
sleep
and
gave
his
instructions
half
of
my
remains
shall
be
buried
by
the
moslem
rites
he
said
let
the
other
half
be
cremated
with
a
hindu
sacrament
he
then
vanished
when
the
disciples
opened
the
coffin
which
had
contained
his
body
nothing
was
found
but
a
dazzling
array
of
champak
flowers
half
of
these
were
obediently
buried
by
the
moslems
who
revere
his
shrine
to
this
day
in
his
youth
kabir
was
approached
by
two
disciples
who
wanted
minute
intellectual
guidance
along
the
mystic
path
the
master
responded
simply
path
presupposes
distance
if
he
be
near
no
path
needest
thou
at
all
verily
it
maketh
me
smile
to
hear
of
a
fish
in
water
athirst
panchanon
established
in
a
garden
at
deogarh
in
bihar
a
temple
containing
a
stone
statue
of
lahiri
mahasaya
another
statue
of
the
great
master
has
been
set
by
disciples
in
the
little
parlor
of
his
benares
home
i
corinthians
chapter
i
go
to
america
america
surely
these
people
are
americans
this
was
my
thought
as
a
panoramic
vision
of
western
faces
passed
before
my
inward
view
immersed
in
meditation
i
was
sitting
behind
some
dusty
boxes
in
the
storeroom
of
the
ranchi
school
a
private
spot
was
difficult
to
find
during
those
busy
years
with
the
youngsters
the
vision
continued
a
vast
multitude
gazing
at
me
intently
swept
actorlike
across
the
stage
of
consciousness
the
storeroom
door
opened
as
usual
one
of
the
young
lads
had
discovered
my
hiding
place
come
here
bimal
i
cried
gaily
i
have
news
for
you
the
lord
is
calling
me
to
america
to
america
the
boy
echoed
my
words
in
a
tone
that
implied
i
had
said
to
the
moon
yes
i
am
going
forth
to
discover
america
like
columbus
he
thought
he
had
found
india
surely
there
is
a
karmic
link
between
those
two
lands
bimal
scampered
away
soon
the
whole
school
was
informed
by
the
newspaper
i
summoned
the
bewildered
faculty
and
gave
the
school
into
its
charge
i
know
you
will
keep
lahiri
mahasaya
yoga
ideals
of
education
ever
to
the
fore
i
said
i
shall
write
you
frequently
god
willing
someday
i
shall
be
back
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
as
i
cast
a
last
look
at
the
little
boys
and
the
sunny
acres
of
ranchi
a
definite
epoch
in
my
life
had
now
closed
i
knew
henceforth
i
would
dwell
in
far
lands
i
entrained
for
calcutta
a
few
hours
after
my
vision
the
following
day
i
received
an
invitation
to
serve
as
the
delegate
from
india
to
an
international
congress
of
religious
liberals
in
america
it
was
to
convene
that
year
in
boston
under
the
auspices
of
the
american
unitarian
association
my
head
in
a
whirl
i
sought
out
sri
yukteswar
in
serampore
guruji
i
have
just
been
invited
to
address
a
religious
congress
in
america
shall
i
go
all
doors
are
open
for
you
master
replied
simply
it
is
now
or
never
but
sir
i
said
in
dismay
what
do
i
know
about
public
speaking
seldom
have
i
given
a
lecture
and
never
in
english
english
or
no
english
your
words
on
yoga
shall
be
heard
in
the
west
i
laughed
well
dear
guruji
i
hardly
think
the
americans
will
learn
bengali
please
bless
me
with
a
push
over
the
hurdles
of
the
english
language
when
i
broke
the
news
of
my
plans
to
father
he
was
utterly
taken
aback
to
him
america
seemed
incredibly
remote
he
feared
he
might
never
see
me
again
how
can
you
go
he
asked
sternly
who
will
finance
you
as
he
had
affectionately
borne
the
expenses
of
my
education
and
whole
life
he
doubtless
hoped
that
his
question
would
bring
my
project
to
an
embarrassing
halt
the
lord
will
surely
finance
me
as
i
made
this
reply
i
thought
of
the
similar
one
i
had
given
long
ago
to
my
brother
ananta
in
agra
without
very
much
guile
i
added
father
perhaps
god
will
put
it
into
your
mind
to
help
me
no
never
he
glanced
at
me
piteously
i
was
astounded
therefore
when
father
handed
me
the
following
day
a
check
made
out
for
a
large
amount
i
give
you
this
money
he
said
not
in
my
capacity
as
a
father
but
as
a
faithful
disciple
of
lahiri
mahasaya
go
then
to
that
far
western
land
spread
there
the
creedless
teachings
of
kriya
yoga
i
was
immensely
touched
at
the
selfless
spirit
in
which
father
had
been
able
to
quickly
put
aside
his
personal
desires
the
just
realization
had
come
to
him
during
the
preceding
night
that
no
ordinary
desire
for
foreign
travel
was
motivating
my
voyage
perhaps
we
shall
not
meet
again
in
this
life
father
who
was
at
this
time
spoke
sadly
an
intuitive
conviction
prompted
me
to
reply
surely
the
lord
will
bring
us
together
once
more
as
i
went
about
my
preparations
to
leave
master
and
my
native
land
for
the
unknown
shores
of
america
i
experienced
not
a
little
trepidation
i
had
heard
many
stories
about
the
materialistic
western
atmosphere
one
very
different
from
the
spiritual
background
of
india
pervaded
with
the
centuried
aura
of
saints
an
oriental
teacher
who
will
dare
the
western
airs
i
thought
must
be
hardy
beyond
the
trials
of
any
himalayan
cold
one
early
morning
i
began
to
pray
with
an
adamant
determination
to
continue
to
even
die
praying
until
i
heard
the
voice
of
god
i
wanted
his
blessing
and
assurance
that
i
would
not
lose
myself
in
the
fogs
of
modern
utilitarianism
my
heart
was
set
to
go
to
america
but
even
more
strongly
was
it
resolved
to
hear
the
solace
of
divine
permission
i
prayed
and
prayed
muffling
my
sobs
no
answer
came
my
silent
petition
increased
in
excruciating
crescendo
until
at
noon
i
had
reached
a
zenith
my
brain
could
no
longer
withstand
the
pressure
of
my
agonies
if
i
cried
once
more
with
an
increased
depth
of
my
inner
passion
i
felt
as
though
my
brain
would
split
at
that
moment
there
came
a
knock
outside
the
vestibule
adjoining
the
gurpar
road
room
in
which
i
was
sitting
opening
the
door
i
saw
a
young
man
in
the
scanty
garb
of
a
renunciate
he
came
in
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
refusing
my
request
to
sit
down
indicated
with
a
gesture
that
he
wished
to
talk
to
me
while
standing
he
must
be
babaji
i
thought
dazed
because
the
man
before
me
had
the
features
of
a
younger
lahiri
mahasaya
he
answered
my
thought
yes
i
am
babaji
he
spoke
melodiously
in
hindi
our
heavenly
father
has
heard
your
prayer
he
commands
me
to
tell
you
follow
the
behests
of
your
guru
and
go
to
america
fear
not
you
will
be
protected
after
a
vibrant
pause
babaji
addressed
me
again
you
are
the
one
i
have
chosen
to
spread
the
message
of
kriya
yoga
in
the
west
long
ago
i
met
your
guru
yukteswar
at
a
kumbha
mela
i
told
him
then
i
would
send
you
to
him
for
training
i
was
speechless
choked
with
devotional
awe
at
his
presence
and
deeply
touched
to
hear
from
his
own
lips
that
he
had
guided
me
to
sri
yukteswar
i
lay
prostrate
before
the
deathless
guru
he
graciously
lifted
me
from
the
floor
telling
me
many
things
about
my
life
he
then
gave
me
some
personal
instruction
and
uttered
a
few
secret
prophecies
kriya
yoga
the
scientific
technique
of
he
finally
said
with
solemnity
will
ultimately
spread
in
all
lands
and
aid
in
harmonizing
the
nations
through
man
personal
transcendental
perception
of
the
infinite
father
with
a
gaze
of
majestic
power
the
master
electrified
me
by
a
glimpse
of
his
cosmic
consciousness
in
a
short
while
he
started
toward
the
door
do
not
try
to
follow
me
he
said
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
so
please
babaji
do
go
away
i
cried
repeatedly
take
me
with
you
looking
back
he
replied
not
now
some
other
time
overcome
by
emotion
i
disregarded
his
warning
as
i
tried
to
pursue
him
i
discovered
that
my
feet
were
firmly
rooted
to
the
floor
from
the
door
babaji
gave
me
a
last
affectionate
glance
he
raised
his
hand
by
way
of
benediction
and
walked
away
my
eyes
fixed
on
him
longingly
after
a
few
minutes
my
feet
were
free
i
sat
down
and
went
into
a
deep
meditation
unceasingly
thanking
god
not
only
for
answering
my
prayer
but
for
blessing
me
by
a
meeting
with
babaji
my
whole
body
seemed
sanctified
through
the
touch
of
the
ancient
master
long
had
it
been
my
burning
desire
to
behold
him
until
now
i
have
never
recounted
to
anyone
this
story
of
my
meeting
with
babaji
holding
it
as
the
most
sacred
of
my
human
experiences
i
have
hidden
it
in
my
heart
but
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
readers
of
this
autobiography
may
be
more
inclined
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
secluded
babaji
and
his
world
interests
if
i
relate
that
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
i
have
helped
an
artist
to
draw
a
true
picture
of
the
great
of
modern
india
it
appears
in
this
book
the
eve
of
my
departure
for
the
united
states
found
me
in
sri
yukteswar
holy
presence
forget
you
were
born
a
hindu
and
do
be
an
american
take
the
best
of
them
both
master
said
in
his
calm
way
of
wisdom
be
your
true
self
a
child
of
god
seek
and
incorporate
into
your
being
the
best
qualities
of
all
your
brothers
scattered
over
the
earth
in
various
races
then
he
blessed
me
all
those
who
come
to
you
with
faith
seeking
god
will
be
helped
as
you
look
at
them
the
spiritual
current
emanating
from
your
eyes
will
enter
into
their
brains
and
change
their
material
habits
making
them
more
he
went
on
your
lot
to
attract
sincere
souls
is
very
good
everywhere
you
go
even
in
a
wilderness
you
will
find
friends
both
of
his
blessings
have
been
amply
demonstrated
i
came
alone
to
america
into
a
wilderness
without
a
single
friend
but
there
i
found
thousands
ready
to
receive
the
i
left
india
in
august
on
the
city
of
sparta
the
first
passenger
boat
sailing
for
america
after
the
close
of
world
war
i
had
been
able
to
book
passage
only
after
the
removal
in
ways
fairly
miraculous
of
many
difficulties
concerned
with
the
granting
of
my
passport
during
the
voyage
a
fellow
passenger
found
out
that
i
was
the
indian
delegate
to
the
boston
congress
swami
yogananda
he
said
with
the
first
of
many
quaint
pronunciations
by
which
i
was
later
to
hear
my
name
spoken
by
the
americans
please
favor
the
passengers
with
a
lecture
next
thursday
night
i
think
we
would
all
benefit
by
a
talk
on
battle
of
life
and
how
to
fight
it
alas
i
had
to
fight
the
battle
of
my
own
life
i
discovered
on
wednesday
desperately
trying
to
organize
my
ideas
into
a
lecture
in
english
i
finally
abandoned
all
preparations
my
thoughts
like
a
wild
colt
eyeing
a
saddle
refused
any
cooperation
with
the
laws
of
english
grammar
fully
trusting
in
master
past
assurances
however
i
appeared
before
my
thursday
audience
in
the
saloon
of
the
steamer
no
eloquence
rose
to
my
lips
speechlessly
i
stood
before
the
assemblage
after
an
endurance
contest
lasting
ten
minutes
the
audience
realized
my
predicament
and
began
to
laugh
illustration
i
stand
on
the
dais
before
one
of
my
classes
in
america
this
class
of
a
thousand
yoga
students
was
held
in
washington
see
the
situation
was
not
funny
to
me
at
the
moment
indignantly
i
sent
a
silent
prayer
to
master
you
can
speak
his
voice
sounded
instantly
within
my
consciousness
my
thoughts
fell
at
once
into
a
friendly
relation
with
the
english
language
minutes
later
the
audience
was
still
attentive
the
talk
won
me
a
number
of
invitations
to
lecture
later
before
various
groups
in
america
i
never
could
remember
afterward
a
word
that
i
had
spoken
by
discreet
inquiry
i
learned
from
a
number
of
passengers
you
gave
an
inspiring
lecture
in
stirring
and
correct
english
at
this
delightful
news
i
humbly
thanked
my
guru
for
his
timely
help
realizing
anew
that
he
was
ever
with
me
setting
at
naught
all
barriers
of
time
and
space
once
in
awhile
during
the
remainder
of
the
ocean
trip
i
experienced
a
few
apprehensive
twinges
about
the
coming
ordeal
at
the
boston
congress
lord
i
prayed
please
let
my
inspiration
be
thyself
and
not
again
the
of
the
audience
the
city
of
sparta
docked
near
boston
in
late
september
on
the
sixth
of
october
i
addressed
the
congress
with
my
maiden
speech
in
america
it
was
well
received
i
sighed
in
relief
the
magnanimous
secretary
of
the
american
unitarian
association
wrote
the
following
comment
in
a
published
account
of
the
congress
proceedings
swami
yogananda
delegate
from
the
brahmacharya
ashram
of
ranchi
india
brought
the
greetings
of
his
association
to
the
congress
in
fluent
english
and
a
forcible
delivery
he
gave
an
address
of
a
philosophical
character
on
science
of
religion
which
has
been
printed
in
pamphlet
form
for
a
wider
distribution
religion
he
maintained
is
universal
and
it
is
one
we
can
not
possibly
universalize
particular
customs
and
convictions
but
the
common
element
in
religion
can
be
universalized
and
we
can
ask
all
alike
to
follow
and
obey
it
due
to
father
generous
check
i
was
able
to
remain
in
america
after
the
congress
was
over
four
happy
years
were
spent
in
humble
circumstances
in
boston
i
gave
public
lectures
taught
classes
and
wrote

the
beautiful
alaskan

with
the
help
of

the
one

before
in
my
vision
at
kashmir

hastened
to
send
sri

pictures
of
these
distant
american
activities
he
replied
with
a
postcard
in
bengali
which
i
here

here
from

a
poem
entitled
god

composed
one
night
as
i
stood
on
a
lecture
platform
from
the
depths
of
slumber
as
i
ascend
the
spiral
stairway
of
wakefulness
i
whisper
god
god
god
thou
art
the
food
and
when
i
break
my
fast
of
nightly
separation
from
thee
i
taste
thee
and
mentally
say
god
god
god
no
matter
where
i
go
the
spotlight
of
my
mind
ever
keeps
turning
on
thee
and
in
the
battle
din
of
activity
my
silent
war
cry
is
ever
god
god
god
when
boisterous
storms
of
trials
shriek
and
when
worries
howl
at
me
i
drown
their
clamor
loudly
chanting
god
god
god
when
my
mind
weaves
dreams
with
threads
of
memories
then
on
that
magic
cloth
i
find
embossed
god
god
god
every
night
in
time
of
deepest
sleep
my
peace
dreams
and
calls
joy

and
my
joy
comes
singing
evermore

my
soul

unheard

on
the
first
of
the
month
when
the

rolled
in
for
upkeep
of
the
mount
washington
and

centers
thought
longingly
of
the
simple
peace
of
india
but
daily
i
saw
a
widening
understanding
between
west
and
east
my
soul
rejoiced
i
have
found
the
great
heart
of
america
expressed
in

luther
burbank
uttered
this
wisdom
as
i
walked
beside
him
in
his
santa
rosa
garden
we
halted
near
a
bed
of
edible
cacti
while
i
was
conducting
experiments
to
make
cacti
he
continued
i
often
talked
to
the
plants
to
create
a
vibration
of
love
have
nothing
to
fear
i
would
tell
them
do
need
your
defensive
thorns
i
will
protect
you
gradually
the
useful
plant
of
the
desert
emerged
in
a
thornless
variety
i
was
charmed
at
this
miracle
please
dear
luther
give
me
a
few
cacti
leaves
to
plant
in
my
garden
at
mount
washington
a
workman
standing
started
to
strip
off
some
leaves
burbank
prevented
him
i
myself
will
pluck
them
for
the
swami
he
handed
me
three
leaves
which
later
i
planted
rejoicing
as
they
grew
to
huge
estate
the
great
horticulturist
told
me
that
his
first
notable
triumph
was
the
large
potato
now
known
by
his
name
with
the
indefatigability
of
genius
he
went
on
to
present

hundreds

tomato

focused
my

led
me
before
the
famous
walnut
tree
by
which
he
had
proved
that
natural
evolution
can
be
telescopically
hastened
in
only
sixteen
years
he
said
this
walnut
tree
reached
a
state
of
abundant
nut
production
to
which
an

would
have
brought

taught
the
principles
of
simple
and
rational
living
we
must
return
to
nature
and
nature
god
luther
you
would
delight
in
my
ranchi
school
with
its
outdoor
classes
and
atmosphere
of
joy
and
simplicity
my
words
touched
the
chord
closest
to
burbank
education
he
plied
me
with
questions
interest
gleaming
from
his
deep
serene
eyes
swamiji
he
said
finally
schools
like
yours
are
the
only
hope
of
a
future
millennium
i
am
in
revolt
against
the
educational
systems
of
our
time
severed
from
nature
and
stifling
of
all
individuality
i
am
with
you
heart
and
soul
in
your
practical
ideals
of
education
as
i
was
taking
leave
of
the
gentle
sage
he
autographed
a
small
volume
and
presented
it
to
me
here
is
my
book
on
the
training
of
the
human
plant
he
said
new
types
of
training
are
experiments
at
times
the
most
daring
trials
have
succeeded
in
bringing
out
the
best
in
fruits
and
flowers
educational
innovations
for
children
should
likewise
become
more
numerous
more
courageous
i
read
his
little
book
that
night
with
intense
interest
his
eye
envisioning
a
glorious
future
for
the
race
he
wrote
the
most
stubborn
living
thing
in
this
world
the
most
difficult
to
swerve
is
a
plant
once
fixed
in
certain
habits
remember
that
this
plant
has
preserved
its
individuality
all
through
the
ages
perhaps
it
is
one
which
can
be
traced
backward
through
eons
of
time
in
the
very
rocks
themselves
never
having
varied
to
any
great
extent
in
all
these
vast
periods
do
you
suppose
after
all
these
ages
of
repetition
the
plant
does
not
become
possessed
of
a
will
if
you
so
choose
to
call
it
of
unparalleled
tenacity
indeed
there
are
plants
like
certain
of
the
palms
so
persistent
that
no
human
power
has
yet
been
able
to
change
them
the
human
will
is
a
weak
thing
beside
the
will
of
a
plant
but
see
how
this
whole
lifelong
stubbornness
is
broken
simply
by
blending
a
new
life
with
it
making
by
crossing
a
complete
and
powerful
change
in
its
life
then
when
the
break
comes
fix
it
by
these
generations
of
patient
supervision
and
selection
and
the
new
plant
sets
out
upon
its
new
way
never
again
to
return
to
the
old
its
tenacious
will
broken
and
changed
at
last
when
it
comes
to
so
sensitive
and
pliable
a
thing
as
the
nature
of
a
child
the
problem
becomes
vastly
easier
magnetically
drawn
to
this
great
american
i
visited
him
again
and
again
one
morning
i
arrived
at
the
same
time
as
the
postman
who
deposited
in
burbank
study
about
a
thousand
letters
horticulturists
wrote
him
from
all
parts
of
the
world
swamiji
your
presence
is
just
the
excuse
i
need
to
get
out
into
the
garden
luther
said
gaily
he
opened
a
large
containing
hundreds
of
travel
folders
see
he
said
this
is
how
i
do
my
traveling
tied
down
by
my
plants
and
correspondence
i
satisfy
my
desire
for
foreign
lands
by
a
glance
now
and
then
at
these
pictures
my
car
was
standing
before
his
gate
luther
and
i
drove
along
the
streets
of
the
little
town
its
gardens
bright
with
his
own
varieties
of
santa
rosa
peachblow
and
burbank
roses
my
friend
henry
ford
and
i
both
believe
in
the
ancient
theory
of
reincarnation
luther
told
me
it
sheds
light
on
aspects
of
life
otherwise
inexplicable
memory
is
not
a
test
of
truth
just
because
man
fails
to
remember
his
past
lives
does
not
prove
he
never
had
them
memory
is
blank
concerning
his
and
infancy
too
but
he
probably
passed
through
them
he
chuckled
the
great
scientist
had
received
kriya
initiation
during
one
of
my
earlier
visits
i
practice
the
technique
devoutly
swamiji
he
said
after
many
thoughtful
questions
to
me
about
various
aspects
of
yoga
luther
remarked
slowly
the
east
indeed
possesses
immense
hoards
of
knowledge
which
the
west
has
scarcely
begun
to
explore
intimate
communion
with
nature
who
unlocked
to
him
many
of
her
jealously
guarded
secrets
had
given
burbank
a
boundless
spiritual
reverence
sometimes
i
feel
very
close
to
the
infinite
power
he
confided
shyly
his
sensitive
beautifully
modeled
face
lit
with
his
memories
then
i
have
been
able
to
heal
sick
persons
around
me
as
well
as
many
ailing
plants
he
told
me
of
his
mother
a
sincere
christian
many
times
after
her
death
luther
said
i
have
been
blessed
by
her
appearance
in
visions
she
has
spoken
to
me
we
drove
back
reluctantly
toward
his
home
and
those
waiting
thousand
letters
luther
i
remarked
next
month
i
am
starting
a
magazine
to
present
the
of
east
and
west
please
help
me
decide
on
a
good
name
for
the
journal
we
discussed
titles
for
awhile
and
finally
agreed
on
after
we
had
reentered
his
study
burbank
gave
me
an
article
he
had
written
on
science
and
civilization
this
will
go
in
the
first
issue
of
i
said
gratefully
as
our
friendship
grew
deeper
i
called
burbank
my
american
saint
behold
a
man
i
quoted
in
whom
there
is
no
guile
his
heart
was
fathomlessly
deep
long
acquainted
with
humility
patience
sacrifice
his
little
home
amidst
the
roses
was
austerely
simple
he
knew
the
worthlessness
of
luxury
the
joy
of
few
possessions
the
modesty
with
which
he
wore
his
scientific
fame
repeatedly
reminded
me
of
the
trees
that
bend
low
with
the
burden
of
ripening
fruits
it
is
the
barren
tree
that
lifts
its
head
high
in
an
empty
boast
i
was
in
new
york
when
in
my
dear
friend
passed
away
in
tears
i
thought
oh
i
would
gladly
walk
all
the
way
from
here
to
santa
rosa
for
one
more
glimpse
of
him
locking
myself
away
from
secretaries
and
visitors
i
spent
the
next
hours
in
seclusion
the
following
day
i
conducted
a
vedic
memorial
rite
around
a
large
picture
of
luther
a
group
of
my
american
students
garbed
in
hindu
ceremonial
clothes
chanted
the
ancient
hymns
as
an
offering
was
made
of
flowers
water
and
of
the
bodily
elements
and
their
release
in
the
infinite
source
though
the
form
of
burbank
lies
in
santa
rosa
under
a
lebanon
cedar
that
he
planted
years
ago
in
his
garden
his
soul
is
enshrined
for
me
in
every
flower
that
blooms
by
the
wayside
withdrawn
for
a
time
into
the
spacious
spirit
of
nature
is
that
not
luther
whispering
in
her
winds
walking
her
dawns
his
name
has
now
passed
into
the
heritage
of
common
speech
listing
burbank
as
a
transitive
verb
webster
new
international
dictionary
defines
it
to
cross
or
graft
a
plant
hence
figuratively
to
improve
anything
as
a
process
or
institution
by
selecting
good
features
and
rejecting
bad
or
by
adding
good
features
beloved
burbank
i
cried
after
reading
the
definition
your
very
name
is
now
a
synonym
for
goodness
luther

california
december
i
have
examined
the
yogoda
system
of
swami
yogananda
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
ideal
for
training
and
harmonizing
man
physical
mental
and
spiritual
natures
swami
aim
is
to
establish
schools
throughout
the
world
wherein
education
will
not
confine
itself
to
intellectual
development
alone
but
also
training
of
the
body
will
and
feelings
through
the
yogoda
system
of
physical
mental
and
spiritual
unfoldment
by
simple
and
scientific
methods
of
concentration
and
meditation
most
of
the
complex
problems
of
life
may
be
solved
and
peace
and
come
upon
earth
the
swami
idea
of
right
education
is
plain
commonsense
free
from
all
mysticism
and
otherwise
it
would
not
have
my
approval
i
am
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
heartily
joining
with
the
swami
in
his
appeal
for
international
schools
on
the
art
of
living
which
if
established
will
come
as
near
to
bringing
the
millennium
as
anything
with
which
i
am
acquainted
burbank
also
gave
me
an
autographed
picture
of
himself
i
treasure
it
even
as
a
hindu
merchant
once
treasured
a
picture
of
lincoln
the
hindu
who
was
in
america
during
the
civil
war
years
conceived
such
an
admiration
for
lincoln
that
he
was
unwilling
to
return
to
india
until
he
had
obtained
a
portrait
of
the
great
emancipator
planting
himself
adamantly
on
lincoln
doorstep
the
merchant
refused
to
leave
until
the
astonished
president
permitted
him
to
engage
the
services
of
daniel
huntington
the
famous
new
york
artist
when
the
portrait
was
finished
the

carried
it

sri

in

i
sat
in
meditation
at
my
mt

headquarters
traversing
ten
thousand
miles
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
his

penetrated
my

fifteen
years
yes
i
realized
now
it
is
i
have
spent
fifteen
years
in

now
he
recalls
me
that
afternoon
i
recounted
my
experience
to
a
visiting
disciple
his
spiritual
development
under
kriya
yoga
was
so
remarkable
that
i
often
called
him
saint
remembering
babaji
prophecy
that
america
too
would
produce
men
and
women
of
divine
realization
through
the
ancient
yogic
path
this

and
a

insisted
on

thus
solved
i
made

in

i
looked
long
at

and
thought
gratefully
lord
he
who
remembers
thee
as
the
sole

never

the
sweetness

i
sailed

two

accompanied

and
an
elderly

from

we
enjoyed
the
days
of

peace
a
welcome
contrast
to
the
past
hurried
weeks
our
period
of
leisure
was
the
speed
of
modern
boats
has
some
regrettable
features
like
any
other
group
of
inquisitive
tourists
we
walked
around
the
huge
and
ancient
city
of
london
the
following
day
i
was
invited
to
address
a
large
meeting
in
caxton
hall
at
which
i
was
introduced
to
the
london
audience
by
sir
francis
younghusband
our
party
spent
a
pleasant
day
as
guests
of
sir
harry
lauder
at
his
estate
in
scotland
we
soon
crossed
the
english
channel
to
the
continent
for
i
wanted
to
make
a
special
pilgrimage
to
bavaria
this
would
be
my
only
chance
i
felt
to
visit
the
great
catholic
mystic
therese
neumann
of
konnersreuth
years
earlier
i
had
read
an
amazing
account
of
therese
information
given
in
the
article
was
as
follows
therese
born
in
had
been
injured
in
an
accident
at
the
age
of
twenty
she
became
blind
and
paralyzed
she
miraculously
regained
her
sight
in
through
prayers
to
teresa
the
little
flower
later
therese
neumann
limbs
were
instantaneously
healed
from
onward
therese
has
abstained
completely
from
food
and
drink
except
for
the
daily
swallowing
of
one
small
consecrated
wafer
the
stigmata
or
sacred
wounds
of
christ
appeared
in
on
therese
head
breast
hands
and
feet
on
friday
of
every
week
thereafter
she
has
passed
through
the
passion
of
christ
suffering
in
her
own
body
all
his
historic
agonies
knowing
ordinarily
only
the
simple
german
of
her
village
during
her
friday
trances
therese
utters
phrases
which
scholars
have
identified
as
ancient
aramaic
at
appropriate
times
in
her
vision
she
speaks
hebrew
or
greek
by
ecclesiastical
permission
therese
has
several
times
been
under
close
scientific
observation
fritz
gerlick
editor
of
a
protestant
german
newspaper
went
to
konnersreuth
to
expose
the
catholic
fraud
but
ended
up
by
reverently
writing
her
biography
as
always
whether
in
east
or
west
i
was
eager
to
meet
a
saint
i
rejoiced
as
our
little
party
entered
on
july
the
quaint
village
of
konnersreuth
the
bavarian
peasants
exhibited
lively
interest
in
our
ford
automobile
brought
with
us
from
america
and
its
assorted
american
young
man
an
elderly
lady
and
an
oriental
with
long
hair
tucked
under
his
coat
collar
therese
little
cottage
clean
and
neat
with
geraniums
blooming
by
a
primitive
well
was
alas
silently
closed
the
neighbors
and
even
the
village
postman
who
passed
by
could
give
us
no
information
rain
began
to
fall
my
companions
suggested
that
we
leave
no
i
said
stubbornly
i
will
stay
here
until
i
find
some
clue
leading
to
therese
two
hours
later
we
were
still
sitting
in
our
car
amidst
the
dismal
rain
lord
i
sighed
complainingly
why
didst
thou
lead
me
here
if
she
has
disappeared
an
man
halted
beside
us
politely
offering
his
aid
i
do
know
for
certain
where
therese
is
he
said
but
she
often
visits
at
the
home
of
professor
wurz
a
seminary
master
of
eichstatt
eighty
miles
from
here
the
following
morning
our
party
motored
to
the
quiet
village
of
eichstatt
narrowly
lined
with
cobblestoned
streets
wurz
greeted
us
cordially
at
his
home
yes
therese
is
here
he
sent
her
word
of
the
visitors
a
messenger
soon
appeared
with
her
reply
though
the
bishop
has
asked
me
to
see
no
one
without
his
permission
i
will
receive
the
man
of
god
from
india
deeply
touched
at
these
words
i
followed
wurz
upstairs
to
the
sitting
room
therese
entered
immediately
radiating
an
aura
of
peace
and
joy
she
wore
a
black
gown
and
spotless
white
head
dress
although
her
age
was
at
this
time
she
seemed
much
younger
possessing
indeed
a
childlike
freshness
and
charm
healthy
and
cheerful
this
is
the
saint
that
does
not
eat
therese
greeted
me
with
a
very
gentle
handshaking
we
both
beamed
in
silent
communion
each
knowing
the
other
to
be
a
lover
of
god
wurz
kindly
offered
to
serve
as
interpreter
as
we
seated
ourselves
i
noticed
that
therese
was
glancing
at
me
with
naive
curiosity
evidently
hindus
had
been
rare
in
bavaria
do
you
eat
anything
i
wanted
to
hear
the
answer
from
her
own
lips
no
except
a
consecrated
wafer
once
every
morning
at
six
how
large
is
the
wafer
it
is
the
size
of
a
small
coin
she
added
i
take
it
for
sacramental
reasons
if
it
is
unconsecrated
i
am
unable
to
swallow
it
certainly
you
could
not
have
lived
on
that
for
twelve
whole
years
i
live
by
god
light
how
simple
her
reply
how
einsteinian
i
see
you
realize
that
energy
flows
to
your
body
from
the
ether
sun
and
air
a
swift
smile
broke
over
her
face
i
am
so
happy
to
know
you
understand
how
i
live
your
sacred
life
is
a
daily
demonstration
of
the
truth
uttered
by
christ
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
again
she
showed
joy
at
my
explanation
it
is
indeed
so
one
of
the
reasons
i
am
here
on
earth
today
is
to
prove
that
man
can
live
by
god
invisible
light
and
not
by
food
only
can
you
teach
others
how
to
live
without
food
she
appeared
a
trifle
shocked
i
can
not
do
that
god
does
not
wish
it
as
my
gaze
fell
on
her
strong
graceful
hands
therese
showed
me
a
little
square
freshly
healed
wound
on
each
of
her
palms
on
the
back
of
each
hand
she
pointed
out
a
smaller
wound
freshly
healed
each
wound
went
straight
through
the
hand
the
sight
brought
to
my
mind
distinct
recollection
of
the
large
square
iron
nails
with
ends
still
used
in
the
orient
but
which
i
do
not
recall
having
seen
in
the
west
the
saint
told
me
something
of
her
weekly
trances
as
a
helpless
onlooker
i
observe
the
whole
passion
of
christ
each
week
from
thursday
midnight
until
friday
afternoon
at
one
her
wounds
open
and
bleed
she
loses
ten
pounds
of
her
ordinary
weight
suffering
intensely
in
her
sympathetic
love
therese
yet
looks
forward
joyously
to
these
weekly
visions
of
her
lord
i
realized
at
once
that
her
strange
life
is
intended
by
god
to
reassure
all
christians
of
the
historical
authenticity
of
jesus
life
and
crucifixion
as
recorded
in
the
new
testament
and
to
dramatically
display
the
bond
between
the
galilean
master
and
his
devotees
professor
wurz
related
some
of
his
experiences
with
the
saint
several
of
us
including
therese
often
travel
for
days
on
trips
throughout
germany
he
told
me
it
is
a
striking
we
have
three
meals
a
day
therese
eats
nothing
she
remains
as
fresh
as
a
rose
untouched
by
the
fatigue
which
the
trips
cause
us
as
we
grow
hungry
and
hunt
for
wayside
inns
she
laughs
merrily
the
professor
added
some
interesting
physiological
details
because
therese
takes
no
food
her
stomach
has
shrunk
she
has
no
excretions
but
her
perspiration
glands
function
her
skin
is
always
soft
and
firm
at
the
time
of
parting
i
expressed
to
therese
my
desire
to
be
present
at
her
trance
yes
please
come
to
konnersreuth
next
friday
she
said
graciously
the
bishop
will
give
you
a
permit
i
am
very
happy
you
sought
me
out
in
eichstatt
therese
shook
hands
gently
many
times
and
walked
with
our
party
to
the
gate
wright
turned
on
the
automobile
radio
the
saint
examined
it
with
little
enthusiastic
chuckles
such
a
large
crowd
of
youngsters
gathered
that
therese
retreated
into
the
house
we
saw
her
at
a
window
where
she
peered
at
us
childlike
waving
her
hand
from
a
conversation
the
next
day
with
two
of
therese
brothers
very
kind
and
amiable
we
learned
that
the
saint
sleeps
only
one
or
two
hours
at
night
in
spite
of
the
many
wounds
in
her
body
she
is
active
and
full
of
energy
she
loves
birds
looks
after
an
aquarium
of
fish
and
works
often
in
her
garden
her
correspondence
is
large
catholic
devotees
write
her
for
prayers
and
healing
blessings
many
seekers
have
been
cured
through
her
of
serious
diseases
her
brother
ferdinand
about
explained
that
therese
has
the
power
through
prayer
of
working
out
on
her
own
body
the
ailments
of
others
the
saint
abstinence
from
food
dates
from
a
time
when
she
prayed
that
the
throat
disease
of
a
young
man
of
her
parish
then
preparing
to
enter
holy
orders
be
transferred
to
her
own
throat
on
thursday
afternoon
our
party
drove
to
the
home
of
the
bishop
who
looked
at
my
flowing
locks
with
some
surprise
he
readily
wrote
out
the
necessary
permit
there
was
no
fee
the
rule
made
by
the
church
is
simply
to
protect
therese
from
the
onrush
of
casual
tourists
who
in
previous
years
had
flocked
on
fridays
by
the
thousands
we
arrived
friday
morning
about
in
konnersreuth
i
noticed
that
therese
little
cottage
possesses
a
special
section
to
afford
her
plenty
of
light
we
were
glad
to
see
the
doors
no
longer
closed
but
in
hospitable
cheer
there
was
a
line
of
about
twenty
visitors
armed
with
their
permits
many
had
come
from
great
distances
to
view
the
mystic
trance
therese
had
passed
my
first
test
at
the
professor
house
by
her
intuitive
knowledge
that
i
wanted
to
see
her
for
spiritual
reasons
and
not
just
to
satisfy
a
passing
curiosity
my
second
test
was
connected
with
the
fact
that
just
before
i
went
upstairs
to
her
room
i
put
myself
into
a
yogic
trance
state
in
order
to
be
one
with
her
in
telepathic
and
televisic
rapport
i
entered
her
chamber
filled
with
visitors
she
was
lying
in
a
white
robe
on
the
bed
with
wright
following
closely
behind
me
i
halted
just
inside
the
threshold
awestruck
at
a
strange
and
most
frightful
spectacle
illustration
therese
neumann
famous
catholic
stigmatist
who
inspired
my
pilgrimage
to
konnersreuth
bavaria
see
blood
flowed
thinly
and
continuously
in
an
stream
from
therese
lower
eyelids
her
gaze
was
focused
upward
on
the
spiritual
eye
within
the
central
forehead
the
cloth
wrapped
around
her
head
was
drenched
in
blood
from
the
stigmata
wounds
of
the
crown
of
thorns
the
white
garment
was
redly
splotched
over
her
heart
from
the
wound
in
her
side
at
the
spot
where
christ
body
long
ages
ago
had
suffered
the
final
indignity
of
the
soldier
therese
hands
were
extended
in
a
gesture
maternal
pleading
her
face
wore
an
expression
both
tortured
and
divine
she
appeared
thinner
changed
in
many
subtle
as
well
as
outward
ways
murmuring
words
in
a
foreign
tongue
she
spoke
with
slightly
quivering
lips
to
persons
visible
before
her
inner
sight
as
i
was
in
attunement
with
her
i
began
to
see
the
scenes
of
her
vision
she
was
watching
jesus
as
he
carried
the
cross
amidst
the
jeering
multitude
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
in
consternation
the
lord
had
fallen
under
the
cruel
weight
the
vision
disappeared
in
the
exhaustion
of
fervid
pity
therese
sank
heavily
against
her
pillow
at
this
moment
i
heard
a
loud
thud
behind
me
turning
my
head
for
a
second
i
saw
two
men
carrying
out
a
prostrate
body
but
because
i
was
coming
out
of
the
deep
superconscious
state
i
did
not
immediately
recognize
the
fallen
person
again
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
therese
face
deathly
pale
under
the
rivulets
of
blood
but
now
calm
radiating
purity
and
holiness
i
glanced
behind
me
later
and
saw
wright
standing
with
his
hand
against
his
cheek
from
which
blood
was
trickling
dick
i
inquired
anxiously
were
you
the
one
who
fell
yes
i
fainted
at
the
terrifying
spectacle
well
i
said
consolingly
you
are
brave
to
return
and
look
upon
the
sight
again
remembering
the
patiently
waiting
line
of
pilgrims
wright
and
i
silently
bade
farewell
to
therese
and
left
her
sacred
presence
the
following
day
our
little
group
motored
south
thankful
that
we
were
not
dependent
on
trains
but
could
stop
the
ford
wherever
we
chose
throughout
the
countryside
we
enjoyed
every
minute
of
a
tour
through
germany
holland
france
and
the
swiss
alps
in
italy
we
made
a
special
trip
to
assisi
to
honor
the
apostle
of
humility
francis
the
european
tour
ended
in
greece
where
we
viewed
the
athenian
temples
and
saw
the
prison
in
which
the
gentle
socrates
had
drunk
his
death
potion
one
is
filled
with
admiration
for
the
artistry
with
which
the
greeks
have
everywhere
wrought
their
very
fancies
in
alabaster
we
took
ship
over
the
sunny
mediterranean
disembarking
at
palestine
wandering
day
after
day
over
the
holy
land
i
was
more
than
ever
convinced
of
the
value
of
pilgrimage
the
spirit
of
christ
is
in
palestine
i
walked
reverently
by
his
side
at
bethlehem
gethsemane
calvary
the
holy
mount
of
olives
and
by
the
river
jordan
and
the
sea
of
galilee
our
little
party
visited
the
birth
manger
joseph
carpenter
shop
the
tomb
of
lazarus
the
house
of
martha
and
mary
the
hall
of
the
last
supper
antiquity
unfolded
scene
by
scene
i
saw
the
divine
drama
that
christ
once
played
for
the
ages
on
to
egypt
with
its
modern
cairo
and
ancient
pyramids
then
a
boat
down
the
narrow
red
sea
over
the
vasty
arabian
sea
lo
india
the
remarkable
inclusion
here
of
a
complete
date
is
due
to
the
fact
that
my
secretary
wright
kept
a
travel
diary
other
books
on
her
life
are
therese
neumann
a
stigmatist
of
our
day
and
further
chronicles
of
therese
neumann

is
not
sustained
by
gross
food
bread
alone
but
by
the
vibratory
cosmic
energy
word
or
aum
the
invisible
power
flows
into
the
human
body
through
the
gate
of
the
medulla
oblongata
this
sixth
bodily
center
is
located
at
the
back
of
the
neck
at
the
top
of
the
five
spinal
chakras
sanskrit
for
wheels
or
centers
of
radiating
force
the
medulla
is
the
principal
entrance
for

of
universal

is
directly
connected
with
man
power
of

concentrated
in
the

cosmic

stored
up
in
the
brain
as
a
reservoir
of
infinite
potentialities
poetically
mentioned
in
the
vedas
as
the
lotus
of
light
the
bible
invariably
refers
to
aum
as
the
holy
ghost
or
invisible
life
force
which
divinely
upholds
all
creation
what
know
ye
not
that
your
body
is
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
which
is
in
you
which
ye
have
of
god
and
ye
are
not
your
own
corinthians
during
the
hours
preceding
my
arrival
therese
had
already
passed
through
many
visions
of
the
closing
days
in
christ
life
her
entrancement
usually
starts
with
scenes
of
the
events
which
followed
the
last
supper
her
visions
end
with
jesus
death
on
the
cross
or
occasionally
with
his
entombment
therese
has
survived
the
nazi
persecution
and
is
still
present
in
konnersreuth
according
to
american
news
dispatches
from
germany
a
passage
in
eusebius
relates
an
interesting
encounter
between
socrates
and
a
hindu
sage
the
passage
runs
aristoxenus
the
musician
tells
the
following
story
about
the
indians
one
of
these
men
met
socrates
at
athens
and
asked
him
what
was
the
scope
of
his
philosophy
inquiry
into
human
phenomena
replied
socrates
at
this
the
indian
burst
out
laughing
can
a
man
inquire
into
human
phenomena
he
said
he
is
ignorant
of
divine
ones
the
aristoxenus
mentioned
was
a
pupil
of
aristotle
and
a
noted
writer
on
harmonics
his
date
is
chapter
i
return
to
india
gratefully
i
was
inhaling
the
blessed
air
of
india
our
boat
rajputana
docked
on
august
in
the
huge
harbor
of
bombay
even
this
my
first
day
off
the
ship
was
a
foretaste
of
the
year
months
of
ceaseless
activity
friends
had
gathered
at
the
dock
with
garlands
and
greetings
soon
at
our
suite
in
the
taj
mahal
hotel
there
was
a
stream
of
reporters
and
photographers
bombay
was
a
city
new
to
me
i
found
it
energetically
modern
with
many
innovations
from
the
west
palms
line
the
spacious
boulevards
magnificent
state
structures
vie
for
interest
with
ancient
temples
very
little
time
was
given
to
however
i
was
impatient
eager
to
see
my
beloved
guru
and
other
dear
ones
consigning
the
ford
to
a
baggage
car
our
party
was
soon
speeding
eastward
by
train
toward
calcutta
our
arrival
at
howrah
station
found
such
an
immense
crowd
assembled
to
greet
us
that
for
awhile
we
were
unable
to
dismount
from
the
train
the
young
maharaja
of
kasimbazar
and
my
brother
bishnu
headed
the
reception
committee
i
was
unprepared
for
the
warmth
and
magnitude
of
our
welcome
preceded
by
a
line
of
automobiles
and
motorcycles
and
amidst
the
joyous
sound
of
drums
and
conch
shells
miss
bletch
wright
and
myself
from
head
to
foot
drove
slowly
to
my
father
home
my
aged
parent
embraced
me
as
one
returning
from
the
dead
long
we
gazed
on
each
other
speechless
with
joy
brothers
and
sisters
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
students
and
friends
of
years
long
past
were
grouped
around
me
not
a
dry
eye
among
us
passed
now
into
the
archives
of
memory
the
scene
of
loving
reunion
vividly
endures
unforgettable
in
my
heart
as
for
my
meeting
with
sri
yukteswar
words
fail
me
let
the
following
description
from
my
secretary
suffice
today
filled
with
the
highest
anticipations
i
drove
yoganandaji
from
calcutta
to
serampore
wright
recorded
in
his
travel
diary
we
passed
by
quaint
shops
one
of
them
the
favorite
eating
haunt
of
yoganandaji
during
his
college
days
and
finally
entered
a
narrow
walled
lane
a
sudden
left
turn
and
there
before
us
towered
the
simple
but
inspiring
ashram
its
balcony
jutting
from
the
upper
floor
the
pervasive
impression
was
that
of
peaceful
solitude
in
grave
humility
i
walked
behind
yoganandaji
into
the
courtyard
within
the
hermitage
walls
hearts
beating
fast
we
proceeded
up
some
old
cement
steps
trod
no
doubt
by
myriads
of
the
tension
grew
keener
and
keener
as
on
we
strode
before
us
near
the
head
of
the
stairs
quietly
appeared
the
great
one
swami
sri
yukteswarji
standing
in
the
noble
pose
of
a
sage
my
heart
heaved
and
swelled
as
i
felt
myself
blessed
by
the
privilege
of
being
in
his
sublime
presence
tears
blurred
my
eager
sight
when
yoganandaji
dropped
to
his
knees
and
with
bowed
head
offered
his
soul
gratitude
and
greeting
touching
with
his
hand
his
guru
feet
and
then
in
humble
obeisance
his
own
head
he
rose
then
and
was
embraced
on
both
sides
of
the
bosom
by
sri
yukteswarji
no
words
passed
at
the
beginning
but
the
most
intense
feeling
was
expressed
in
the
mute
phrases
of
the
soul
how
their
eyes
sparkled
and
were
fired
with
the
warmth
of
renewed
a
tender
vibration
surged
through
the
quiet
patio
and
even
the
sun
eluded
the
clouds
to
add
a
sudden
blaze
of
glory
on
bended
knee
before
the
master
i
gave
my
own
unexpressed
love
and
thanks
touching
his
feet
calloused
by
time
and
service
and
receiving
his
blessing
i
stood
then
and
faced
two
beautiful
deep
eyes
smouldering
with
introspection
yet
radiant
with
joy
we
entered
his
sitting
room
whose
whole
side
opened
to
the
outer
balcony
first
seen
from
the
street
the
master
braced
himself
against
a
worn
davenport
sitting
on
a
covered
mattress
on
the
cement
floor
yoganandaji
and
i
sat
near
the
guru
feet
with
pillows
to
lean
against
and
ease
our
positions
on
the
straw
mat
i
tried
and
tried
to
penetrate
the
bengali
conversation
between
the
two
english
i
discovered
is
null
and
void
when
they
are
together
although
swamiji
maharaj
as
the
great
guru
is
called
by
others
can
and
often
does
speak
it
but
i
perceived
the
saintliness
of
the
great
one
through
his
smile
and
twinkling
eyes
one
quality
easily
discernible
in
his
merry
serious
conversation
is
a
decided
positiveness
in
mark
of
a
wise
man
who
knows
he
knows
because
he
knows
god
his
great
wisdom
strength
of
purpose
and
determination
are
apparent
in
every
way
studying
him
reverently
from
time
to
time
i
noted
that
he
is
of
large
athletic
stature
hardened
by
the
trials
and
sacrifices
of
renunciation
his
poise
is
majestic
a
decidedly
sloping
forehead
as
if
seeking
the
heavens
dominates
his
divine
countenance
he
has
a
rather
large
and
homely
nose
with
which
he
amuses
himself
in
idle
moments
flipping
and
wiggling
it
with
his
fingers
like
a
child
his
powerful
dark
eyes
are
haloed
by
an
ethereal
blue
ring
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
begins
as
silver
and
changes
to
streaks
of
and
ending
in
ringlets
at
his
shoulders
his
beard
and
moustache
are
scant
or
thinned
out
yet
seem
to
enhance
his
features
and
like
his
character
are
deep
and
light
at
the
same
time
he
has
a
jovial
and
rollicking
laugh
which
comes
from
deep
in
his
chest
causing
him
to
shake
and
quiver
throughout
his
cheerful
and
sincere
his
face
and
stature
are
striking
in
their
power
as
are
his
muscular
fingers
he
moves
with
a
dignified
tread
and
erect
posture
he
was
clad
simply
in
the
common
dhoti
and
shirt
both
once
dyed
a
strong
ocher
color
but
now
a
faded
orange
glancing
about
i
observed
that
this
rather
dilapidated
room
suggested
the
owner
to
material
comforts
the
white
walls
of
the
long
chamber
were
streaked
with
fading
blue
plaster
at
one
end
of
the
room
hung
a
picture
of
lahiri
mahasaya
garlanded
in
simple
devotion
there
was
also
an
old
picture
showing
yoganandaji
as
he
had
first
arrived
in
boston
standing
with
the
other
delegates
to
the
congress
of
religions
i
noted
a
quaint
concurrence
of
modernity
and
antiquation
a
huge
chandelier
was
covered
with
cobwebs
through
disuse
and
on
the
wall
was
a
bright
calendar
the
whole
room
emanated
a
fragrance
of
peace
and
calmness
beyond
the
balcony
i
could
see
coconut
trees
towering
over
the
hermitage
in
silent
protection
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
master
has
merely
to
clap
his
hands
together
and
before
finishing
he
is
served
or
attended
by
some
small
disciple
incidentally
i
am
much
attracted
to
one
of
thin
lad
named
prafulla
with
long
black
hair
to
his
shoulders
a
most
penetrating
pair
of
sparkling
black
eyes
and
a
heavenly
smile
his
eyes
twinkle
as
the
corners
of
his
mouth
rise
like
the
stars
and
the
crescent
moon
appearing
at
twilight
swami
sri
yukteswarji
joy
is
obviously
intense
at
the
return
of
his
and
he
seems
to
be
somewhat
inquisitive
about
the
product
however
predominance
of
the
in
the
great
one
nature
hinders
his
outward
expression
of
feeling
yoganandaji
presented
him
with
some
gifts
as
is
the
custom
when
the
disciple
returns
to
his
guru
we
sat
down
later
to
a
simple
but
meal
all
the
dishes
were
vegetable
and
rice
combinations
sri
yukteswarji
was
pleased
at
my
use
of
a
number
of
indian
customs
for
example
after
several
hours
of
flying
bengali
phrases
and
the
exchange
of
warm
smiles
and
joyful
glances
we
paid
obeisance
at
his
feet
bade
adieu
with
a
pronam
and
departed
for
calcutta
with
an
everlasting
memory
of
a
sacred
meeting
and
greeting
although
i
write
chiefly
of
my
external
impressions
of
him
yet
i
was
always
conscious
of
the
true
basis
of
the
spiritual
glory
i
felt
his
power
and
shall
carry
that
feeling
as
my
divine
blessing
from
america
europe
and
palestine
i
had
brought
many
presents
for
sri
yukteswar
he
received
them
smilingly
but
without
remark
for
my
own
use
i
had
bought
in
germany
a
combination
in
india
i
decided
to
give
the
cane
to
master
this
gift
i
appreciate
indeed
my
guru
eyes
were
turned
on
me
with
affectionate
understanding
as
he
made
the
unwonted
comment
from
all
the
presents
it
was
the
cane
that
he
singled
out
to
display
to
visitors
master
please
permit
me
to
get
a
new
carpet
for
the
sitting
room
i
had
noticed
that
sri
yukteswar
tiger
skin
was
placed
over
a
torn
rug
do
so
if
it
pleases
you
my
guru
voice
was
not
enthusiastic
behold
my
tiger
mat
is
nice
and
clean
i
am
monarch
in
my
own
little
kingdom
beyond
it
is
the
vast
world
interested
only
in
externals
as
he
uttered
these
words
i
felt
the
years
roll
back
once
again
i
am
a
young
disciple
purified
in
the
daily
fires
of
chastisement
as
soon
as
i
could
tear
myself
away
from
serampore
and
calcutta
i
set
out
with
wright
for
ranchi
what
a
welcome
there
a
veritable
ovation
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
as
i
embraced
the
selfless
teachers
who
had
kept
the
banner
of
the
school
flying
during
my
fifteen
years
absence
the
bright
faces
and
happy
smiles
of
the
residential
and
day
students
were
ample
testimony
to
the
worth
of
their
school
and
yoga
training
yet
alas
the
ranchi
institution
was
in
dire
financial
difficulties
sir
manindra
chandra
nundy
the
old
maharaja
whose
kasimbazar
palace
had
been
converted
into
the
central
school
building
and
who
had
made
many
princely
donations
was
now
dead
many
free
benevolent
features
of
the
school
were
now
seriously
endangered
for
lack
of
sufficient
public
support
i
had
not
spent
years
in
america
without
learning
some
of
its
practical
wisdom
its
undaunted
spirit
before
obstacles
for
one
week
i
remained
in
ranchi
wrestling
with
critical
problems
then
came
interviews
in
calcutta
with
prominent
leaders
and
educators
a
long
talk
with
the
young
maharaja
of
kasimbazar
a
financial
appeal
to
my
father
and
lo
the
shaky
foundations
of
ranchi
began
to
be
righted
many
donations
including
one
huge
check
arrived
in
the
nick
of
time
from
my
american
students
within
a
few
months
after
my
arrival
in
india
i
had
the
joy
of
seeing
the
ranchi
school
legally
incorporated
my
lifelong
dream
of
a
permanently
endowed
yoga
educational
center
stood
fulfilled
that
vision
had
guided
me
in
the
humble
beginnings
in
with
a
group
of
seven
boys
in
the
decade
since
ranchi
has
enlarged
its
scope
far
beyond
the
boys
school
widespread
humanitarian
activities
are
now
carried
on
there
in
the
shyama
charan
lahiri
mahasaya
mission
the
school
or
yogoda
brahmacharya
vidyalaya
conducts
outdoor
classes
in
grammar
and
high
school
subjects
the
residential
students
and
day
scholars
also
receive
vocational
training
of
some
kind
the
boys
themselves
regulate
most
of
their
activities
through
autonomous
committees
very
early
in
my
career
as
an
educator
i
discovered
that
boys
who
impishly
delight
in
outwitting
a
teacher
will
cheerfully
accept
disciplinary
rules
that
are
set
by
their
fellow
students
never
a
model
pupil
myself
i
had
a
ready
sympathy
for
all
boyish
pranks
and
problems
sports
and
games
are
encouraged
the
fields
resound
with
hockey
and
football
practice
ranchi
students
often
win
the
cup
at
competitive
events
the
outdoor
gymnasium
is
known
far
and
wide
muscle
recharging
through

power
is
the
yogoda

direction
of
life
energy
to
any
part
of
the
body
the
boys
are
also
taught
asanas
postures
sword
and
lathi
stick
play
and
jujitsu
the
yogoda
health
exhibitions
at
the
ranchi
vidyalaya
have
been
attended
by
thousands
instruction
in
primary
subjects
is
given
in
hindi
to
the
kols
santals
and
mundas
aboriginal
tribes
of
the
province
classes
for
girls
only
have
been
organized
in
villages
the
unique
feature
at
ranchi
is
the
initiation
into
kriya
yoga
the
boys
daily
practice
their
spiritual
exercises
engage
in
gita
chanting
and
are
taught
by
precept
and
example
the
virtues
of
simplicity
honor
and
truth
evil
is
pointed
out
to
them
as
being
that
which
produces
misery
good
as
those
actions
which
result
in
true
happiness
evil
may
be
compared
to
poisoned
honey
tempting
but
laden
with
death
overcoming
restlessness
of
body
and
mind
by
concentration
techniques
has
achieved
astonishing
results
it
is
no
novelty
at
ranchi
to
see
an
appealing
little
figure
aged
nine
or
ten
years
sitting
for
an
hour
or
more
in
unbroken
poise
the
unwinking
gaze
directed
to
the
spiritual
eye
often
the
picture
of
these
ranchi
students
has
returned
to
my
mind
as
i
observed
collegians
over
the
world
who
are
hardly
able
to
sit
still
through
one
class
period
ranchi

the

include
a

teachings
to

in

parts

it
is
needless
to
say
that
all
these
educational
and
humanitarian
activities
have
required
the
service
and
devotion
of
many
teachers
and
workers
i
do
not
list
their
names
here
because
they
are
so
numerous
but
in
my
heart
each
one
has
a
lustrous
niche
inspired
by
the
ideals
of
lahiri
mahasaya
these
teachers
have
abandoned
promising
worldly
goals

one

i
asked
him
a
question
dick
what
is
your
impression
of
india
peace
he
said
thoughtfully
the

aura
is
peace
we
broke
our

halfway
across

sir
vijayaraghavachari
in
the
hindustan
times
has
described
the
tests
put
to
the
modern
professional
memory
men
of
madras
these
men
he
wrote
were
unusually
learned
in
sanskrit
literature
seated
in
the
midst
of
a
large
audience
they
were
equal
to
the
tests
that
several
members
of
the
audience
simultaneously
put
them
to
the
test
would
be
like
this
one
person
would
start
ringing
a
bell
the
number
of
rings
having
to
be
counted
by
the
man
a
second
person
would
dictate
from
a
paper
a
long
exercise
in
arithmetic
involving
addition
subtraction
multiplication
and
division
a
third
would
go
on
reciting
from
the
ramayana
or
the
mahabharata
a
long
series
of
poems
which
had
to
be
reproduced
a
fourth
would
set
problems
in
versification
which
required
the
composition
of
verses
in
proper
meter
on
a
given
subject
each
line
to
end
in
a
specified
word
a
fifth
man
would
carry

a
theological
disputation
the
exact
language
of
which
had
to
be
quoted
in
the
precise
order
in
which
the
disputants
conducted
it
and
a
seventh
man
was
all
the
while
turning
a
wheel
the
number
of
revolutions
of
which
had
to
be
counted
the
memory
expert
had
simultaneously
to
do
all
these
feats
purely
by
mental
processes
as
he
was
allowed
no
paper
and
pencil
the
strain
on
the
faculties
must
have
been
terrific
ordinarily
men
in
unconscious
envy
are
apt
to
depreciate
such
efforts
by
affecting
to
believe
that
they
involve
only
the
exercise
of
the
lower
functionings
of
the
brain
it
is
not
however
a
pure
question
of
memory
the
greater
factor
is

were
now
relaxing
in

his
travel
diary
gives
the
following
account
of
his
impressions
of
mysore
brilliantly
green
rice
fields
varied
by
tasseled
sugar
cane
patches
nestle
at
the
protective
foot
of
rocky
dotting
the
emerald
panorama
like
excrescences
of
black
the
play
of
colors
is
enhanced
by
the
sudden
and
dramatic
disappearance
of
the
sun
as
it
seeks
rest
behind
the
solemn
hills
many
rapturous
moments
have
been
spent
in
gazing
almost
at
the
canvas
of
god
stretched
across
the
firmament
for
his
touch
alone
is
able
to
produce
colors
that
vibrate
with
the
freshness
of
life
that
youth
of
colors
is
lost
when
man
tries
to
imitate
with
mere
pigments
for
the
lord
resorts
to
a
more
simple
and
effective
that
are
neither
oils
nor
pigments
but
mere
rays
of
light
he
tosses
a
splash
of
light
here
and
it
reflects
red
he
waves
the
brush
again
and
it
blends
gradually
into
orange
and
gold
then
with
a
piercing
thrust
he
stabs
the
clouds
with
a
streak
of
purple
that
leaves
a
ringlet
or
fringe
of
red
oozing
out
of
the
wound
in
the
clouds
and
so
on
and
on
he
plays
night
and
morning
alike
no
patterns
no
duplicates
no
colors
just
the
same
the
beauty
of
the
indian
change
in
day
to
night
is
beyond
compare
elsewhere
often
the
sky
looks
as
if
god
had
taken
all
the
colors
in
his
kit
and
given
them
one
mighty
kaleidoscopic
toss
into
the
heavens
i
must
relate
the
splendor
of
a
twilight
visit
to
the
huge
krishnaraja
sagar
dam
constructed
twelve
miles
outside
of
mysore
yoganandaji
and
i
boarded
a
small
bus
and
with
a
small
boy
as
official
cranker
or
battery
substitute
started
off
over
a
smooth
dirt
road
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
on
the
horizon
and
squashing
like
an
overripe
tomato
our
journey
led
past
the
omnipresent
square
rice
fields
through
a
line
of
comforting
banyan
trees
in
between
a
grove
of
towering
coconut
palms
with
vegetation
nearly
as
thick
as
in
a
jungle
and
finally
approaching
the
crest
of
a
hill
we
came
with
an
immense
artificial
lake
reflecting
the
stars
and
fringe
of
palms
and
other
trees
surrounded
by
lovely
terraced
gardens
and
a
row
of
electric
lights
on
the
brink
of
the
below
it
our
eyes
met
a
dazzling
spectacle
of
colored
beams
playing
on
geyserlike
fountains
like
so
many
streams
of
brilliant
ink
pouring
blue
waterfalls
arresting
red
cataracts
green
and
yellow
sprays
elephants
spouting
water
a
miniature
of
the
chicago
world
fair
and
yet
modernly
outstanding
in
this
ancient
land
of
paddy
fields
and
simple
people
who
have
given
us
such
a
loving
welcome
that
i
fear
it
will
take
more
than
my
strength
to
bring
yoganandaji
back
to
america
another
rare
first
elephant
ride
yesterday
the
yuvaraja
invited
us
to
his
summer
palace
to
enjoy
a
ride
on
one
of
his
elephants
an
enormous
beast
i
mounted
a
ladder
provided
to
climb

intensely
interesting
stories
have
been
minutely
recorded
by

historians
and
others
who
accompanied
or
followed
after
alexander
in
his
expedition
to
india
the
narratives
of
arrian
diodoros
plutarch
and
strabo
the
geographer
have
been
translated
by
to
throw
a
shaft
of
light
on
ancient
india
the
most
admirable
feature
of
alexander
unsuccessful
invasion
was
the
deep
interest
he
displayed
in
hindu
philosophy
and
in
the
yogis
and
holy
men
whom
he
encountered
from
time
to
time
and
whose
society
he
eagerly
sought
shortly
after
the
greek
warrior
had
arrived
in
taxila
in
northern
india
he
sent
a
messenger
onesikritos
a
disciple
of
the
hellenic
school
of
diogenes
to
fetch
an
indian
teacher
dandamis
a
great
sannyasi
of
taxila
hail
to
thee
o
teacher
of
brahmins
onesikritos
said
after
seeking
out
dandamis
in
his
forest
retreat
the
son
of
the
mighty
god
zeus
being
alexander
who
is
the
sovereign
lord
of
all
men
asks
you
to
go
to
him
and
if
you
comply
he
will
reward
you
with
great
gifts
but
if
you
refuse
he
will
cut
off
your
head
the
yogi
received
this
fairly
compulsive
invitation
calmly
and
did
not
so
much
as
lift
up
his
head
from
his
couch
of
leaves
i
also
am
a
son
of
zeus
if
alexander
be
such
he
commented
i
want
nothing
that
is
alexander
for
i
am
content
with
what
i
have
while
i
see
that
he
wanders
with
his
men
over
sea
and
land
for
no
advantage
and
is
never
coming
to
an
end
of
his
wanderings
go
and
tell
alexander
that
god
the
supreme
king
is
never
the
author
of
insolent
wrong
but
is
the
creator
of
light
of
peace
of
life
of
water
of
the
body
of
man
and
of
souls
he
receives
all
men
when
death
sets
them
free
being
in
no
way
subject
to
evil
disease
he
alone
is
the
god
of
my
homage
who
abhors
slaughter
and
instigates
no
wars
alexander
is
no
god
since
he
must
taste
of
death
continued
the
sage
in
quiet
scorn
how
can
such
as
he
be
the
world
master
when
he
has
not
yet
seated
himself
on
a
throne
of
inner
universal
dominion
neither
as
yet
has
he
entered
living
into
hades
nor
does
he
know
the
course
of
the
sun
through
the
central
regions
of
the
earth
while
the
nations
on
its
boundaries
have
not
so
much
as
heard
his
name
after
this
chastisement
surely
the
most
caustic
ever
sent
to
assault
the
ears
of
the
lord
of
the
world
the
sage
added
ironically
if
alexander
present
dominions
be
not
capacious
enough
for
his
desires
let
him
cross
the
ganges
river
there
he
will
find
a
region
able
to
sustain
all
his
men
if
the
country
on
this
side
be
too
narrow
to
hold
him
know
this
however
that
what
alexander
offers
and
the
gifts
he
promises
are
things
to
me
utterly
useless
the
things
i
prize
and
find
of
real
use
and
worth
are
these
leaves
which
are
my
house
these
blooming
plants
which
supply
me
with
daily
food
and
the
water
which
is
my
drink
while
all
other
possessions
which
are
amassed
with
anxious
care
are
wont
to
prove
ruinous
to
those
who
gather
them
and
cause
only
sorrow
and
vexation
with
which
every
poor
mortal
is
fully
fraught
as
for
me
i
lie
upon
the
forest
leaves
and
having
nothing
which
requires
guarding
close
my
eyes
in
tranquil
slumber
whereas
had
i
anything
to
guard
that
would
banish
sleep
the
earth
supplies
me
with
everything
even
as
a
mother
her
child
with
milk
i
go
wherever
i
please
and
there
are
no
cares
with
which
i
am
forced
to
cumber
myself
should
alexander
cut
off
my
head
he
can
not
also
destroy
my
soul
my
head
alone
then
silent
will
remain
leaving
the
body
like
a
torn
garment
upon
the
earth
whence
also
it
was
taken
i
then
becoming
spirit
shall
ascend
to
my
god
who
enclosed
us
all
in
flesh
and
left
us
upon
earth
to
prove
whether
when
here
below
we
shall
live
obedient
to
his
ordinances
and
who
also
will
require
of
us
all
when
we
depart
hence
to
his
presence
an
account
of
our
life
since
he
is
judge
of
all
proud
wrongdoing
for
the
groans
of
the
oppressed
become
the
punishment
of
the
oppressor
let
alexander
then
terrify
with
these
threats
those
who
wish
for
wealth
and
who
dread
death
for
against
us
these
weapons
are
both
alike
powerless
the
brahmins
neither
love
gold
nor
fear
death
go
then
and
tell
alexander
this
dandamis
has
no
need
of
aught
that
is
yours
and
therefore
will
not
go
to
you
and
if
you
want
anything
from
dandamis
come
you
to
him
with
close
attention
alexander
received
through
onesikritos
the
message
from
the
yogi
and
felt
a
stronger
desire
than
ever
to
see
dandamis
who
though
old
and
naked
was
the
only
antagonist
in
whom
he
the
conqueror
of
many
nations
had
met
more
than
his
match
alexander
invited
to
taxila
a
number
of
brahmin
ascetics
noted
for
their
skill
in
answering
philosophical
questions
with
pithy
wisdom
an
account
of
the
verbal
skirmish
is
given
by
plutarch
alexander
himself
framed
all
the
questions
which
be
the
more
numerous
the
living
or
the
dead
the
living
for
the
dead
are
not
which
breeds
the
larger
animals
the
sea
or
the
land
the
land
for
the
sea
is
only
a
part
of
land
which
is
the
cleverest
of
beasts
that
one
with
which
man
is
not
yet
acquainted
man
fears
the
unknown
which
existed
first
the
day
or
the
night
the
day
was
first
by
one
day
this
reply
caused
alexander
to
betray
surprise
the
brahmin
added
impossible
questions
require
impossible
answers
how
best
may
a
man
make
himself
beloved
a
man
will
be
beloved
if
possessed
with
great
power
he
still
does
not
make
himself
feared
how
may
a
man
become
a
god
by
doing
that
which
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
to
do
which
is
stronger
life
or
death
life
because
it
bears
so
many
evils
alexander
succeeded
in
taking
out
of
india
as
his
teacher
a
true
yogi
this
man
was
swami
sphines
called
kalanos
by
the
greeks
because
the
saint
a
devotee
of
god
in
the
form
of
kali
greeted
everyone
by
pronouncing
her
auspicious
name
kalanos
accompanied
alexander
to
persia
on
a
stated
day
at
susa
in
persia
kalanos
gave
up
his
aged
body
by
entering
a
funeral
pyre
in
view
of
the
whole
macedonian
army
the
historians
record
the
astonishment
of
the
soldiers
who
observed
that
the
yogi
had
no
fear
of
pain
or
death
and
who
never
once
moved
from
his
position
as
he
was
consumed
in
the
flames
before
leaving
for
his
cremation
kalanos
had
embraced
all
his
close
companions
but
refrained
from
bidding
farewell
to
alexander
to
whom
the
hindu
sage
had
merely
remarked
i
shall
see
you
shortly
in
babylon
alexander
left
persia
and
died
a
year
later
in
babylon
his
indian
guru
words
had
been
his
way
of
saying
he
would
be
present
with
alexander
in
life
and
death

greek
historians
have
left
us
many
vivid
and
inspiring
pictures

us

the
people
and
ordains
that
no
one
among

shall
under
any
circumstances
be
a
slave
but
that
enjoying
freedom
themselves
they
shall
respect
the
equal
right
to
it
which
all
possess
for
those
they
thought
who
have
learned
neither
to
domineer
over

vicissitudes

neither
put
out
money
at

nor
know
how
to
borrow
it
is
contrary
to
established
usage
for
an
indian
either
to
do
or
suffer
a
wrong
and
therefore
they
neither
make
contracts
nor
require

healing
we
are
told
was
by

means
cures
are
effected
rather
by
regulating

than
by
the
use

in
its
immemorial
rudeness
dealt
us
no
courteous
extensions
i
was
scheduled
soon
to
address
the
concluding
session
of
the
indian
philosophical
congress
at
calcutta
university
at
the
end
of
the
visit
to
mysore
i
enjoyed
a
talk
with
sir
raman
president
of
the
indian
academy
of

this
brilliant
hindu
physicist
was
awarded
the
nobel
prize
in

a

farewell
to

of

students
and
friends
wright
and
i
set
out
for
the
north
on
the
way
we
stopped
before
a
little
shrine
sacred
to
the
memory
of
sadasiva
brahman
in
whose
life
story
miracles
cluster
thickly
a
larger
sadasiva
shrine
at
nerur
erected
by
the
raja
of
pudukkottai
is
a
pilgrimage
spot
which
has
witnessed
numerous
divine
healings
many
quaint
stories
of
sadasiva
a
lovable
and
master
are
still
current
among
the
south
indian
villagers
immersed
one
day
in
samadhi
on
the
bank
of
the
kaveri
river
sadasiva
was
seen
to
be
carried
away
by
a
sudden
flood
weeks
later
he
was
found
buried
deep
beneath
a
mound
of
earth
as
the
villagers
shovels
struck
his
body
the
saint
rose
and
walked
briskly
away
sadasiva
never
spoke
a
word
or
wore
a
cloth
one
morning
the
nude
yogi
unceremoniously
entered
the
tent
of
a
mohammedan
chieftain
his
ladies
screamed
in
alarm
the
warrior
dealt
a
savage
sword
thrust
at
sadasiva
whose
arm
was
severed
the
master
departed
unconcernedly
overcome
by
remorse
the
mohammedan
picked
up
the
arm
from
the
floor
and
followed
sadasiva
the
yogi
quietly
inserted
his
arm
into
the
bleeding
stump
when
the
warrior
humbly
asked
for
some
spiritual
instruction
sadasiva
wrote
with
his
finger
on
the
sands
do
not
do
what
you
want
and
then
you
may
do
what
you
like
the
mohammedan
was
uplifted
to
an
exalted
state
of
mind
and
understood
the
saint
paradoxical
advice
to
be
a
guide
to
soul
freedom
through
mastery
of
the
ego
the
village
children
once
expressed
a
desire
in
sadasiva
presence
to
see
the
madura
religious
festival
miles
away
the
yogi
indicated
to
the
little
ones
that
they
should
touch
his
body
lo
instantly
the
whole
group
was
transported
to
madura
the
children
wandered
happily
among
the
thousands
of
pilgrims
in
a
few
hours
the
yogi
brought
his
small
charges
home
by
his
simple
mode
of
transportation
the
astonished
parents
heard
the
vivid
tales
of
the
procession
of
images
and
noted
that
several
children
were
carrying
bags
of
madura
sweets
an
incredulous
youth
derided
the
saint
and
the
story
the
following
morning
he
approached
sadasiva
master
he
said
scornfully
why
do
you
take
me
to
the
festival
even
as
you
did
yesterday
for
the
other
children
sadasiva
complied
the
boy
immediately
found
himself
among
the
distant
city
throng
but
alas
where
was
the
saint
when
the
youth
wanted
to
leave
the
weary
boy

inclusion

castes
originally
depended
not
on

on
his
natural
capacities
as
demonstrated
by
the
goal
in

he
elected
to
achieve
an

tells
us
this
goal
could
be
kama
desire

fulfilling

controlling

brahmin
stage
these
four
castes
render
service
to
humanity
by
body
mind
will
power
spirit
these
four
stages
have
their
correspondence
in
the
eternal
gunas
or
qualities
of
nature
tamas
rajas
and
sattva
obstruction
activity
and
expansion
or
mass
energy
and
intelligence
the
four
natural
castes
are
marked
by
the
gunas
as
tamas
ignorance
mixture
of
ignorance
and
activity
mixture
of
right
activity
and
enlightenment
sattva
enlightenment
thus
has
nature
marked
every
man
with
his
caste
by
the
predominance
in
himself
of
one
or
the
mixture
of
two
of
the
gunas
of
course
every
human
being
has
all
three
gunas
in
varying
proportions
the
guru
will
be
able
rightly
to
determine
a
caste
or
evolutionary
status
to
a
certain
extent
all
races
and
nations
observe
in
practice
if
not
in
theory
the
features
of
caste
where
there
is
great
license
or
liberty
particularly
in
intermarriage
between
extremes
in
the
natural
castes
the
race
dwindles
away
and
becomes
extinct
the
purana
samhita
compares
the
offspring
of
such
unions
to
barren
hybrids
like
the
mule
which
is
incapable
of
propagation
of
its
own
species
artificial
species
are
eventually
exterminated
history
offers
abundant
proof
of
numerous
great
races
which
no
longer
have
any
living
representatives
the
caste
system
of
india
is
credited
by
her
most
profound
thinkers
with
being
the
check
or
preventive
against
license
which
has
preserved
the
purity
of
the
race

brought
it

millenniums

for

carried
an
article
on
sadasiva
life
chapter
last
days
with
my
guru
guruji
i
am
glad
to
find
you
alone
this
morning
i
had
just
arrived
at
the
serampore
hermitage
carrying
a
fragrant
burden
of
fruit
and
roses
sri
yukteswar
glanced
at
me
meekly
what
is
your
question
master
looked
about
the
room
as
though
he
were
seeking
escape
guruji
i
came
to
you
as
a
youth
now
i
am
a
grown
man
even
with
a
gray
hair
or
two
though
you
have
showered
me
with
silent
affection
from
the
first
hour
to
this
do
you
realize
that
once
only
on
the
day
of
meeting
have
you
ever
said
love
you
i
looked
at
him
pleadingly
master
lowered
his
gaze
yogananda
must
i
bring
out
into
the
cold
realms
of
speech
the
warm
sentiments
best
guarded
by
the
wordless
heart
guruji
i
know
you
love
me
but
my
mortal
ears
ache
to
hear
you
say
so
be
it
as
you
wish
during
my
married
life
i
often
yearned
for
a
son
to
train
in
the
yogic
path
but
when
you
came
into
my
life
i
was
content
in
you
i
have
found
my
son
two
clear
teardrops
stood
in
sri
yukteswar
eyes
yogananda
i
love
you
always
your
answer
is
my
passport
to
heaven
i
felt
a
weight
lift
from
my
heart
dissolved
forever
at
his
words
often
had
i
wondered
at
his
silence
realizing
that
he
was
unemotional
and
yet
sometimes
i
feared
i
had
been
unsuccessful
in
fully
satisfying
him
his
was
a
strange
nature
never
utterly
to
be
known
a
nature
deep
and
still
unfathomable
to
the
outer
world
whose
values
he
had
long
transcended
a
few
days
later
when
i
spoke
before
a
huge
audience
at
albert
hall
in
calcutta
sri
yukteswar
consented
to
sit
beside
me
on
the
platform
with
the
maharaja
of
santosh
and
the
mayor
of
calcutta
though
master
made
no
remark
to
me
i
glanced
at
him
from
time
to
time
during
my
address
and
thought
i
detected
a
pleased
twinkle
in
his
eyes
then
came
a
talk
before
the
alumni
of
serampore
college
as
i
gazed
upon
my
old
classmates
and
as
they
gazed
on
their
own
mad
monk
tears
of
joy
showed
unashamedly
my
professor
of
philosophy
ghoshal
came
forward
to
greet
me
all
our
past
misunderstandings
dissolved
by
the
alchemist
time
a
winter
solstice
festival
was
celebrated
at
the
end
of
december
in
the
serampore
hermitage
as
always
sri
yukteswar
disciples
gathered
from
far
and
near
devotional
sankirtans
solos
in
the
voice
of
a
feast
served
by
young
disciples
master
profoundly
moving
discourse
under
the
stars
in
the
thronged
courtyard
of
the
memories
joyous
festivals
of
years
long
past
tonight
however
there
was
to
be
a
new
feature
yogananda
please
address
the
english
eyes
were
twinkling
as
he
made
this
doubly
unusual
request
was
he
thinking
of
the
shipboard
predicament
that
had
preceded
my
first
lecture
in
english
i
told
the
story
to
my
audience
of
brother
disciples
ending
with
a
fervent
tribute
to
our
guru
his
omnipresent
guidance
was
with
me
not
alone
on
the
ocean
steamer
i
concluded
but
daily
throughout
my
fifteen
years
in
the
vast
and
hospitable
land
of
america
after
the
guests
had
departed
sri
yukteswar
called
me
to
the
same
bedroom
only
after
a
festival
of
my
early
had
been
permitted
to
sleep
on
his
wooden
bed
tonight
my
guru
was
sitting
there
quietly
a
semicircle
of
disciples
at
his
feet
he
smiled
as
i
quickly
entered
the
room
yogananda
are
you
leaving
now
for
calcutta
please
return
here
tomorrow
i
have
certain
things
to
tell
you
the
next
afternoon
with
a
few
simple
words
of
blessing
sri
yukteswar
bestowed
on
me
the
further
monastic
title
of
paramhansa
it
now
formally
supersedes
your
former
title
of
swami
he
said
as
i
knelt
before
him
with
a
silent
chuckle
i
thought
of
the
struggle
which
my
american
students
would
undergo
over
the
pronunciation
of
paramhansaji
my
task
on
earth
is
now
finished
you
must
carry
on
master
spoke
quietly
his
eyes
calm
and
gentle
my
heart
was
palpitating
in
fear
please
send
someone
to
take
charge
of
our
ashram
at
puri
sri
yukteswar
went
on
i
leave
everything
in
your
hands
you
will
be
able
to
successfully
sail
the
boat
of
your
life
and
that
of
the
organization
to
the
divine
shores
in
tears
i
was
embracing
his
feet
he
rose
and
blessed
me
endearingly
the
following
day
i
summoned
from
ranchi
a
disciple
swami
sebananda
and
sent
him
to
puri
to
assume
the
hermitage
duties
later
my
guru
discussed
with
me
the
legal
details
of
settling
his
estate
he
was
anxious
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
litigation
by
relatives
after
his
death
for
possession
of
his
two
hermitages
and
other
properties
which
he
wished
to
be
deeded
over
solely
for
charitable
purposes
arrangements
were
recently
made
for
master
to
visit
kidderpore
but
he
failed
to
go
amulaya
babu
a
brother
disciple
made
this
remark
to
me
one
afternoon
i
felt
a
cold
wave
of
premonition
to
my
pressing
inquiries
sri
yukteswar
only
replied
i
shall
go
to
kidderpore
no
more
for
a
moment
master
trembled
like
a
frightened
child
attachment
to
bodily
residence
springing
up
of
its
own
nature
arising
from
immemorial
roots
past
experiences
of
death
patanjali
wrote
is
present
in
slight
degree
even
in
great
saints
in
some
of
his
discourses
on
death
my
guru
had
been
wont
to
add
just
as
a
bird
hesitates
to
leave
its
accustomed
home
when
the
door
is
opened
guruji
i
entreated
him
with
a
sob
do
say
that
never
utter
those
words
to
me
sri
yukteswar
face
relaxed
in
a
peaceful
smile
though
nearing
his
birthday
he
looked
well
and
strong
basking
day
by
day
in
the
sunshine
of
my
guru
love
unspoken
but
keenly
felt
i
banished
from
my
conscious
mind
the
various
hints
he
had
given
of
his
approaching
passing
sir
the
kumbha
mela
is
convening
this
month
at
allahabad
i
showed
master
the
mela
dates
in
a
bengali
almanac
do
you
really
want
to
go
not
sensing
sri
yukteswar
reluctance
to
have
me
leave
him
i
went
on
once
you
beheld
the
blessed
sight
of
babaji
at
an
allahabad
kumbha
perhaps
this
time
i
shall
be
fortunate
enough
to
see
him
i
do
not
think
you
will
meet
him
there
my
guru
then
fell
into
silence
not
wishing
to
obstruct
my
plans
when
i
set
out
for
allahabad
the
following
day
with
a
small
group
master
blessed
me
quietly
in
his
usual
manner
apparently
i
was
remaining
oblivious
to
implications
in
sri
yukteswar
attitude
because
the
lord
wished
to
spare
me
the
experience
of
being
forced
helplessly
to
witness
my
guru
passing
it
has
always
happened
in
my
life
that
at
the
death
of
those
dearly
beloved
by
me
god
has
compassionately
arranged
that
i
be
distant
from
the
scene
our
party
reached
the
kumbha
mela
on
january
the
surging
crowd
of
nearly
two
million
persons
was
an
impressive
sight
even
an
overwhelming
one
the
peculiar
genius
of
the
indian
people
is
the
reverence
innate
in
even
the
lowliest
peasant
for
the
worth
of
the
spirit
and
for
the
monks
and
sadhus
who
have
forsaken
worldly
ties
to
seek
a
diviner
anchorage
imposters
and
hypocrites
there
are
indeed
but
india
respects
all
for
the
sake
of
the
few
who
illumine
the
whole
land
with
supernal
blessings
westerners
who
were
viewing
the
vast
spectacle
had
a
unique
opportunity
to
feel
the
pulse
of
the
land
the
spiritual
ardor
to
which
india
owes
her
quenchless
vitality

the
dusty
feet
of
saints
a
turn
of
our
heads
and
a
line
of
elephants
caparisoned
horses
and
rajputana
camels
filed
by
or
a
quaint
religious
parade
of
naked
sadhus
waving
scepters
of
gold
and
silver
or
flags
and
streamers
of
silken
velvet
anchorites
wearing
only
loincloths
sat
quietly
in
little
groups
their
bodies
besmeared
with
the
ashes
that
protect
them
from
the
heat
and
cold
the
spiritual
eye
was
vividly
represented
on
their
foreheads
by
a
single
spot
of
sandalwood
paste
swamis
appeared
by
the
thousands
and
carrying
their
bamboo
staff
and
begging
bowl
their
faces
beamed
with
the
peace
as
they
walked
about
or
held
philosophical
discussions
with
disciples
here
and
there
under
the
trees
around
huge
piles
of
burning
logs
were
picturesque
sadhus
their
hair
braided
and
massed
in
coils
on
top
of
their
heads
some
wore
beards
several
feet
in
length
curled
and
tied
in
a
knot
they
meditated
quietly
or
extended
their
hands
in
blessing
to
the
passing
maharajas
on
elephants
women
in
multicolored
saris
their
bangles
and
anklets
tinkling
fakirs
with
thin
arms
held
grotesquely
aloft
brahmacharis
carrying
meditation
humble
sages
whose
solemnity
hid
an
inner
bliss
high
above
the
din
we
heard
the
ceaseless
summons
of
the
temple
bells
on
our
second
mela
day
my
companions
and
i
entered
various
ashrams
and
temporary
huts
offering
pronams
to
saintly
personages
we
received
the
blessing
of
the
leader
of
the
giri
branch
of
the
swami
thin
ascetical
monk
with
eyes
of
smiling
fire
our
next
visit
took
us
to
a
hermitage
whose
guru
had
observed
for
the
past
nine
years
the
vows
of
silence
and
a
strict
fruitarian
diet
on
the
central
dais
in
the
ashram
hall
sat
a
blind
sadhu
pragla
chakshu
profoundly
learned
in
the
shastras
and
highly
revered
by
all
sects
after
i
had
given
a
brief
discourse
in
hindi
on
vedanta
our
group
left
the
peaceful
hermitage
to
greet
a
swami
krishnananda
a
handsome
monk
with
rosy
cheeks
and
impressive
shoulders
reclining
near
him
was
a
tame
lioness
succumbing
to
the
monk
spiritual
charm
not
i
am
sure
to
his
powerful
physique
jungle
animal
refuses
all
meat
in
favor
of
rice
and
milk
the
swami
has
taught
the
beast
to
utter
aum
in
a
deep
attractive
cat
devotee
our
next
encounter
an
interview
with
a
learned
young
sadhu
is
well
described
in
wright
sparkling
travel
diary
we
rode
in
the
ford
across
the
very
low
ganges
on
a
creaking
pontoon
bridge
crawling
snakelike
through
the
crowds
and
over
narrow
twisting
lanes
passing
the
site
on
the
river
bank
which
yoganandaji
pointed
out
to
me
as
the
meeting
place
of
babaji
and
sri
yukteswarji
alighting
from
the
car
a
short
time
later
we
walked
some
distance
through
the
thickening
smoke
of
the
fires
and
over
the
slippery
sands
to
reach
a
cluster
of
tiny
very
modest
huts
we
halted
in
front
of
one
of
these
insignificant
temporary
dwellings
with
a
pygmy
doorless
entrance
the
shelter
of
kara
patri
a
young
wandering
sadhu
noted
for
his
exceptional
intelligence
there
he
sat
on
a
pile
of
straw
his
only
incidentally
his
only
an
ocher
cloth
draped
over
his
shoulders
truly
a
divine
face
smiled
at
us
after
we
had
crawled
on
all
fours
into
the
hut
and
pronamed
at
the
feet
of
this
enlightened
soul
while
the
kerosene
lantern
at
the
entrance
flickered
weird
dancing
shadows
on
the
thatched
walls
his
face
especially
his
eyes
and
perfect
teeth
beamed
and
glistened
although
i
was
puzzled
by
the
hindi
his
expressions
were
very
revealing
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
love
spiritual
glory
no
one
could
be
mistaken
as
to
his
greatness
imagine
the
happy
life
of
one
unattached
to
the
material
world
free
of
the
clothing
problem
free
of
food
craving
never
begging
never
touching
cooked
food
except
on
alternate
days
never
carrying
a
begging
bowl
free
of
all
money
entanglements
never
handling
money
never
storing
things
away
always
trusting
in
god
free
of
transportation
worries
never
riding
in
vehicles
but
always
walking
on
the
banks
of
the
sacred
rivers
never
remaining
in
one
place
longer
than
a
week
in
order
to
avoid
any
growth
of
attachment
such
a
modest
soul
unusually
learned
in
the
vedas
and
possessing
an
degree
and
the
title
of
shastri
master
of
scriptures
from
benares
university
a
sublime
feeling
pervaded
me
as
i
sat
at
his
feet
it
all
seemed
to
be
an
answer
to
my
desire
to
see
the
real
the
ancient
india
for
he
is
a
true
representative
of
this
land
of
spiritual
giants
i
questioned
kara
patri
about
his
wandering
life
do
you
have
any
extra
clothes
for
winter
no
this
is
enough
do
you
carry
any
books
no
i
teach
from
memory
those
people
who
wish
to
hear
me
what
else
do
you
do
i
roam
by
the
ganges
at
these
quiet
words
i
was
overpowered
by
a
yearning
for
the
simplicity
of
his
life
i
remembered
america
and
all
the
responsibilities
that
lay
on
my
shoulders
no
yogananda
i
thought
sadly
for
a
moment
in
this
life
roaming
by
the
ganges
is
not
for
you
after
the
sadhu
had
told
me
a
few
of
his
spiritual
realizations
i
shot
an
abrupt
question
are
you
giving
these
descriptions
from
scriptural
lore
or
from
inward
experience
half
from
book
learning
he
answered
with
a
straightforward
smile
and
half
from
experience
we
sat
happily
awhile
in
meditative
silence
after
we
had
left
his
sacred
presence
i
said
to
wright
he
is
a
king
sitting
on
a
throne
of
golden
straw
we
had
our
dinner
that
night
on
the
mela
grounds
under
the
stars
eating
from
leaf
plates
pinned
together
with
sticks
dishwashings
in
india
are
reduced
to
a
minimum
two
more
days
of
the
fascinating
kumbha
then
northwest
along
the
jumna
banks
to
agra
once
again
i
gazed
on
the
taj
mahal
in
memory
jitendra
stood
by
my
side
awed
by
the
dream
in
marble
then
on
to
the
brindaban
ashram
of
swami
keshabananda
my
object
in
seeking
out
keshabananda
was
connected
with
this
book
i
had
never
forgotten
sri
yukteswar
request
that
i
write
the
life
of
lahiri
mahasaya
during
my
stay
in
india
i
was
taking
every
opportunity
of
contacting
direct
disciples
and
relatives
of
the
yogavatar
recording
their
conversations
in
voluminous
notes
i
verified
facts
and
dates
and
collected
photographs
old
letters
and
documents
my
lahiri
mahasaya
portfolio
began
to
swell
i
realized
with
dismay
that
ahead
of
me
lay
arduous
labors
in
authorship
i
prayed
that
i
might
be
equal
to
my
role
as
biographer
of
the
colossal
guru
several
of
his
disciples
feared
that
in
a
written
account
their
master
might
be
belittled
or
misinterpreted
one
can
hardly
do
justice
in
cold
words
to
the
life
of
a
divine
incarnation
panchanon
bhattacharya
had
once
remarked
to
me
other
close
disciples
were
similarly
satisfied
to
keep
the
yogavatar
hidden
in
their
hearts
as
the
deathless
preceptor
nevertheless
mindful
of
lahiri
mahasaya
prediction
about
his
biography
i
spared
no
effort
to
secure
and
substantiate
the
facts
of
his
outward
life
swami
keshabananda
greeted
our
party
warmly
at
brindaban
in
his
katayani
peith
ashram
an
imposing
brick
building
with
massive
black
pillars
set
in
a
beautiful
garden
he
ushered
us
at
once
into
a
sitting
room
adorned
with
an
enlargement
of
lahiri
picture
the
swami
was
approaching
the
age
of
ninety
but
his
muscular
body
radiated
strength
and
health
with
long
hair
and
a
beard
eyes
twinkling
with
joy
he
was
a
veritable
patriarchal
embodiment
i
informed
him
that
i
wanted
to
mention
his
name
in
my
book
on
india
masters
please
tell
me
about
your
earlier
life
i
smiled
entreatingly
great
yogis
are
often
uncommunicative
keshabananda
made
a
gesture
of
humility
there
is
little
of
external
moment
practically
my
whole
life
has
been
spent
in
the
himalayan
solitudes
traveling
on
foot
from
one
quiet
cave
to
another
for
a
while
i
maintained
a
small
ashram
outside
hardwar
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
grove
of
tall
trees
it
was
a
peaceful
spot
little
visited
by
travelers
owing
to
the
ubiquitous
presence
of
cobras
keshabananda
chuckled
later
a
ganges
flood
washed
away
the
hermitage
and
cobras
alike
my
disciples
then
helped
me
to
build
this
brindaban
ashram
one
of
our
party
asked
the
swami
how
he
had
protected
himself
against
the
himalayan
tigers
keshabananda
shook
his
head
in
those
high
spiritual
altitudes
he
said
wild
beasts
seldom
molest
the
yogis
once
in
the
jungle
i
encountered
a
tiger
at
my
sudden
ejaculation
the
animal
was
transfixed
as
though
turned
to
stone
again
the
swami
chuckled
at
his
memories
occasionally
i
left
my
seclusion
to
visit
my
guru
in
benares
he
used
to
joke
with
me
over
my
ceaseless
travels
in
the
himalayan
wilderness
have
the
mark
of
wanderlust
on
your
foot
he
told
me
once
am
glad
that
the
sacred
himalayas
are
extensive
enough
to
engross
you
many
times
keshabananda
went
on
both
before
and
after
his
passing
lahiri
mahasaya
has
appeared
bodily
before
me
for
him
no
himalayan
height
is
inaccessible
two
hours
later
he
led
us
to
a
dining
patio
i
sighed
in
silent
dismay
another
meal
less
than
a
year
of
indian
hospitality
and
i
had
gained
fifty
pounds
yet
it
would
have
been
considered
the
height
of
rudeness
to
refuse
any
of
the
dishes
carefully
prepared
for
the
endless
banquets
in
my
honor
in
india
nowhere
else
alas
a
swami
is
considered
a
delightful
sight

in

see
after
dinner
keshabananda
led
me
to
a
secluded
nook
your
arrival
is
not
unexpected
he
said
i
have
a
message
for
you
i
was
surprised
no
one
had
known
of
my
plan
to
visit
keshabananda
while
roaming
last
year
in
the
northern
himalayas
near
badrinarayan
the
swami
continued
i
lost
my
way
shelter
appeared
in
a
spacious
cave
which
was
empty
though
the
embers
of
a
fire
glowed
in
a
hole
in
the
rocky
floor
wondering
about
the
occupant
of
this
lonely
retreat
i
sat
near
the
fire
my
gaze
fixed
on
the
sunlit
entrance
to
the
cave
i
am
glad
you
are
here
these
words
came
from
behind
me
i
turned
startled
and
was
dazzled
to
behold
babaji
the
great
guru
had
materialized
himself
in
a
recess
of
the
cave
overjoyed
to
see
him
again
after
many
years
i
prostrated
myself
at
his
holy
feet
called
you
here
babaji
went
on
is
why
you
lost
your
way
and
were
led
to
my
temporary
abode
in
this
cave
it
is
a
long
time
since
our
last
meeting
i
am
pleased
to
greet
you
once
more
the
deathless
master
blessed
me
with
some
words
of
spiritual
help
then
added
give
you
a
message
for
yogananda
he
will
pay
you
a
visit
on
his
return
to
india
many
matters
connected
with
his
guru
and
with
the
surviving
disciples
of
lahiri
will
keep
yogananda
fully
occupied
tell
him
then
that
i
wo
see
him
this
time
as
he
is
eagerly
hoping
but
i
shall
see
him
on
some
other
occasion
i
was
deeply
touched
to
receive
from
keshabananda
lips
this
consoling
promise
from
babaji
a
certain
hurt
in
my
heart
vanished
i
grieved
no
longer
that
even
as
sri
yukteswar
had
hinted
babaji
did
not
appear
at
the
kumbha
mela
spending
one
night
as
guests
of
the
ashram
our
party
set
out
the
following
afternoon
for
calcutta
riding
over
a
bridge
of
the
jumna
river
we
enjoyed
a
magnificent
view
of
the
skyline
of
brindaban
just
as
the
sun
set
fire
to
the
veritable
furnace
of
vulcan
in
color
reflected
below
us
in
the
still
waters
the
jumna
beach
is
hallowed
by
memories
of
the
child
sri
krishna
here
he
engaged
with
innocent
sweetness
in
his
lilas
plays
with
the
gopis
maids
exemplifying
the
supernal
love
which
ever
exists
between
a
divine
incarnation
and
his
devotees
the
life
of
lord
krishna
has
been
misunderstood
by
many
western
commentators
scriptural
allegory
is
baffling
to
literal
minds
a
hilarious
blunder
by
a
translator
will
illustrate
this
point
the
story
concerns
an
inspired
medieval
saint
the
cobbler
ravidas
who
sang
in
the
simple
terms
of
his
own
trade
of
the
spiritual
glory
hidden
in
all
mankind
under
the
vast
vault
of
blue
lives
the
divinity
clothed
in
hide
one
turns
aside
to
hide
a
smile
on
hearing
the
pedestrian
interpretation
given
to
ravidas
poem
by
a
western
writer
he
afterwards
built
a
hut
set
up
in
it
an
idol
which
he
made
from
a
hide
and
applied
himself
to
its
worship
ravidas
was
a
brother
disciple
of
the
great
kabir
one
of
exalted
chelas
was
the
rani
of
chitor
she
invited
a
large
number
of
brahmins
to
a
feast
in
honor
of
her
teacher
but
they
refused
to
eat
with
a
lowly
cobbler
as
they
sat
down
in
dignified
aloofness
to
eat
their
own
uncontaminated
meal
lo
each
brahmin
found
at
his
side
the
form
of
ravidas
this
mass
vision
accomplished
a
widespread
spiritual
revival
in
chitor
in
a
few
days
our
little
group
reached
calcutta
eager
to
see
sri
yukteswar
i
was
disappointed
to
hear
that
he
had
left
serampore
and
was
now
in
puri
about
three
hundred
miles
to
the
south
come
to
puri
ashram
at
once
this
telegram
was
sent
on
march
by
a
brother
disciple
to
atul
chandra
roy
chowdhry
one
of
chelas
in
calcutta
news
of
the
message
reached
my
ears
anguished
at
its
implications
i
dropped
to
my
knees
and
implored
god
that
my
guru
life
be
spared
as
i
was
about
to
leave
father
home
for
the
train
a
divine
voice
spoke
within
do
not
go
to
puri
tonight
thy
prayer
can
not
be
granted
lord
i
said
thou
dost
not
wish
to
engage
with
me
in
a
of
war
at
puri
where
thou
wilt
have
to
deny
my
incessant
prayers
for
master
life
must
he
then
depart
for
higher
duties
at
thy
behest
in
obedience
to
the
inward
command
i
did
not
leave
that
night
for
puri
the
following
evening
i
set
out
for
the
train
on
the
way
at
seven
a
black
astral
cloud
suddenly
covered
the
sky
later
while
the
train
roared
toward
puri
a
vision
of
sri
yukteswar
appeared
before
me
he
was
sitting
very
grave
of
countenance
with
a
light
on
each
side
is
it
all
over
i
lifted
my
arms
beseechingly
he
nodded
then
slowly
vanished
as
i
stood
on
the
puri
train
platform
the
following
morning
still
hoping
against
hope
an
unknown
man
approached
me
have
you
heard
that
your
master
is
gone
he
left
me
without
another
word
i
never
discovered
who
he
was
nor
how
he
had
known
where
to
find
me
stunned
i
swayed
against
the
platform
wall
realizing
that
in
diverse
ways
my
guru
was
trying
to
convey
to
me
the
devastating
news
seething
with
rebellion
my
soul
was
like
a
volcano
by
the
time
i
reached
the
puri
hermitage
i
was
nearing
collapse
the
inner
voice
was
tenderly
repeating
collect
yourself
be
calm
i
entered
the
ashram
room
where
master
body
unimaginably
lifelike
was
sitting
in
the
lotus
picture
of
health
and
loveliness
a
short
time
before
his
passing
my
guru
had
been
slightly
ill
with
fever
but
before
the
day
of
his
ascension
into
the
infinite
his
body
had
become
completely
well
no
matter
how
often
i
looked
at
his
dear
form
i
could
not
realize
that
its
life
had
departed
his
skin
was
smooth
and
soft
in
his
face
was
a
beatific
expression
of
tranquillity
he
had
consciously
relinquished
his
body
at
the
hour
of
mystic
summoning
the
lion
of
bengal
is
gone

the

was
carried
to

principal
disciple

was
sri

and
spread
in
america
the
message
of
the
masters
of
india
his
interpretations
of

inculcate
in

the
true
spirit
of

and

which
was
personified
in
him
i
returned
to
calcutta
not
trusting
myself
as
yet
to
go
to
the
serampore
hermitage
with
its
sacred
memories
i
summoned
prafulla
sri

little
disciple

gone
he
cried
is
gone
he
added
cryptically
shall
have
to
tell
him
some
other
way
he
sat
then
for
hours
in
silence
my
days
were
filled
with
lectures
classes
interviews
and
reunions
with
old
friends
beneath
a
hollow
smile
and
a
life
of
ceaseless
activity
a
stream
of
black
brooding
polluted
the
inner
river
of
bliss
which
for
so
many
years
had
meandered
under
the
sands
of
all
my
perceptions
where
has
that
divine
sage
gone
i
cried
silently
from
the
depths
of
a
tormented
spirit
no
answer
came
it
is
best
that
master
has
completed
his
union
with
the
cosmic
beloved
my
mind
assured
me
he
is
eternally
glowing
in
the
dominion
of
deathlessness
never
again
may
you
see
him
in
the

a

an
australian
explorer
francis
birtles
has
recounted
that
he
found
the
indian
jungles
varied
beautiful
and
safe
his
safety
charm
was
flypaper
every
night
i
spread
a
quantity
of
sheets
around
my
camp
and
was
never
disturbed
he
explained
the
reason
is
psychological
the
tiger
is
an
animal
of
great
conscious
dignity
he
prowls
around
and
challenges
man
until
he
comes
to
the
flypaper
he
then
slinks
away
no
dignified
tiger
would
dare
face
a
human
being
after
squatting
down
upon
a
sticky
flypaper
after
i
returned

chapter
the
resurrection
of
sri
yukteswar
lord
krishna
the
glorious
form
of
the

appeared
in
a
shimmering
blaze
as
i
sat
in
my
room
at
the
regent
hotel
in
bombay
shining
over
the
roof
of
a
high
building
across
the
street
the
ineffable
vision
had
suddenly
burst
on
my
sight
as
i
gazed
out
of
my
long
open
window
the
divine
figure
waved
to
me
smiling
and
nodding
in
greeting
when
i
could
not
understand
the
exact
message
of
lord
krishna
he
departed
with
a
gesture
of
blessing
wondrously
uplifted
i
felt
that
some
spiritual
event
was
presaged
my
western
voyage
had
for
the
time
being
been
cancelled
i
was
scheduled
for
several
public
addresses
in
bombay
before
leaving
on
a
return
visit
to
bengal
sitting
on
my
bed
in
the
bombay
hotel
at
three
in
the
afternoon
of
june
week
after
the
vision
of
was
roused
from
my
meditation
by
a
beatific
light
before
my
open
and
astonished
eyes
the
whole
room
was
transformed
into
a
strange
world
the
sunlight
transmuted
into
supernal
splendor
waves
of
rapture
engulfed
me
as
i
beheld
the
flesh
and
blood
form
of
sri
yukteswar
my
son
master
spoke
tenderly
on
his
face
an
smile
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
did
not
kneel
at
his
feet
in
greeting
but
instantly
advanced
to
gather
him
hungrily
in
my
arms
moment
of
moments
the
anguish
of
past
months
was
toll
i
counted
weightless
against
the
torrential
bliss
now
descending
master
mine
beloved
of
my
heart
why
did
you
leave
me
i
was
incoherent
in
an
excess
of
joy
why
did
you
let
me
go
to
the
kumbha
mela
how
bitterly
have
i
blamed
myself
for
leaving
you

i

i
left
you
only
for

not

one
i
buried
beneath
the
cruel

my

though
i
see
it
as
ethereal
to
your
sight

is

atoms
i
created
an
entirely
new

exactly
like
that
physical

which
you
laid
beneath
the
at

in
your
i
am
in
truth
on

but
on
an
astral

its

are
better
able
than

my
lofty

there
you

someday
come

chuckle
please
dear

he
said
wo
you
relax
your
hold
a
little
only
a
little
i
had
been
embracing
him
with
an
octopus
grip
i
could
detect
the
same
faint
fragrant
natural
odor
which
had
been
characteristic
of
his
body
before
the
thrilling
touch
of
his
divine
flesh
still
persists
around
the
inner
sides
of
my
arms
and
in
my
palms
whenever
i
recall
those
glorious
hours
as
prophets
are
sent
on
earth
to
help
men
work
out
their
physical
karma
so
i
have
been
directed
by
god
to
serve
on
an
astral
planet
as
a
savior
sri
yukteswar
explained
it
is
called
hiranyaloka
or
astral
planet
there
i
am
aiding
advanced
beings
to
rid
themselves
of
astral
karma
and
thus
attain
liberation
from
astral
rebirths
the
dwellers
on
hiranyaloka
are
highly
developed
spiritually
all
of
them
had
acquired
in
their
last
the
power
of
consciously
leaving
their
physical
bodies
at
death
no
one
can
enter
hiranyaloka
unless
he
has
passed
on
earth
beyond
the
state
of
sabikalpa
samadhi
into
the
higher
state
of
nirbikalpa
samadhi
the
hiranyaloka
inhabitants
have
already
passed
through
the
ordinary
astral
spheres
where
nearly
all
beings
from
earth
must
go
at
death
there
they
worked
out
many
seeds
of
their
past
actions
in
the
astral
worlds
none
but
advanced
beings
can
perform
such
redemptive
work
effectually
in
the
astral
worlds
then
in
order
to
free
their
souls
more
fully
from
the
cocoon
of
karmic
traces
lodged
in
their
astral
bodies
these
higher
beings
were
drawn
by
cosmic
law
to
be
reborn
with
new
astral
bodies
on
hiranyaloka
the
astral
sun
or
heaven
where
i
have
resurrected
to
help
them
there
are
also
highly
advanced
beings
on
hiranyaloka
who
have
come
from
the
superior
subtler
causal
world
my
mind
was
now
in
such
perfect
attunement
with
my
guru
that
he
was
conveying
his
to
me
partly
by
speech
and
partly
by
i
was
thus
quickly
receiving
his
you
have
read
in
the
scriptures
master
went
on
that
god
encased
the
human
soul
successively
in
three
idea
or
causal
body
the
subtle
astral
body
seat
of
man
mental
and
emotional
natures
and
the
gross
physical
body
on
earth
a
man
is
equipped
with
his
physical
senses
an
astral
being
works
with
his
consciousness
and
feelings
and
a
body
made
of
lifetrons
a
being
remains
in
the
blissful
realm
of
ideas
my
work
is
with
those
astral
beings
who
are
preparing
to
enter
the
causal
world
adorable
master
please
tell
me
more
about
the
astral
cosmos
though
i
had
slightly
relaxed
my
embrace
at
sri
yukteswar
request
my
arms
were
still
around
him
treasure
beyond
all
treasures
my
guru
who
had
laughed
at
death
to
reach
me
there
are
many
astral
planets
teeming
with
astral
beings
master
began
the
inhabitants
use
astral
planes
or
masses
of
light
to
travel
from
one
planet
to
another
faster
than
electricity
and
radioactive
energies
the
astral
universe
made
of
various
subtle
vibrations
of
light
and
color
is
hundreds
of
times
larger
than
the
material
cosmos
the
entire
physical
creation
hangs
like
a
little
solid
basket
under
the
huge
luminous
balloon
of
the
astral
sphere
just
as
many
physical
suns
and
stars
roam
in
space
so
there
are
also
countless
astral
solar
and
stellar
systems
their
planets
have
astral
suns
and
moons
more
beautiful
than
the
physical
ones
the
astral
luminaries
resemble
the
aurora
sunny
astral
aurora
being
more
dazzling
than
the
the
astral
day
and
night
are
longer
than
those
of
earth
the
astral
world
is
infinitely
beautiful
clean
pure
and
orderly
there
are
no
dead
planets
or
barren
lands
the
terrestrial
blemishes
weeds
bacteria
insects
absent
unlike
the
variable
climates
and
seasons
of
the
earth
the
astral
planets
maintain
the
even
temperature
of
an
eternal
spring
with
occasional
luminous
white
snow
and
rain
of
lights
astral
planets
abound
in
opal
lakes
and
bright
seas
and
rainbow
rivers
the
ordinary
astral
the
subtler
astral
heaven
of
peopled
with
millions
of
astral
beings
who
have
come
more
or
less
recently
from
the
earth
and
also
with
myriads
of
fairies
mermaids
fishes
animals
goblins
gnomes
demigods
and
spirits
all
residing
on
different
astral
planets
in
accordance
with
karmic
qualifications
various
spheric
mansions
or
vibratory
regions
are
provided
for
good
and
evil
spirits
good
ones
can
travel
freely
but
the
evil
spirits
are
confined
to
limited
zones
in
the
same
way
that
human
beings
live
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
worms
inside
the
soil
fish
in
water
and
birds
in
air
so
astral
beings
of
different
grades
are
assigned
to
suitable
vibratory
quarters
among
the
fallen
dark
angels
expelled
from
other
worlds
friction
and
war
take
place
with
lifetronic
bombs
or
mental
mantric
vibratory
rays
these
beings
dwell
in
the
regions
of
the
lower
astral
cosmos
working
out
their
evil
karma
in
the
vast
realms
above
the
dark
astral
prison
all
is
shining
and
beautiful
the
astral
cosmos
is
more
naturally
attuned
than
the
earth
to
the
divine
will
and
plan
of
perfection
every
astral
object
is
manifested
primarily
by
the
will
of
god
and
partially
by
the
of
astral
beings
they
possess
the
power
of
modifying
or
enhancing
the
grace
and
form
of
anything
already
created
by
the
lord
he
has
given
his
astral
children
the
freedom
and
privilege
of
changing
or
improving
at
will
the
astral
cosmos
on
earth
a
solid
must
be
transformed
into
liquid
or
other
form
through
natural
or
chemical
processes
but
astral
solids
are
changed
into
astral
liquids
gases
or
energy
solely
and
instantly
by
the
will
of
the
inhabitants
the
earth
is
dark
with
warfare
and
murder
in
the
sea
land
and
air
my
guru
continued
but
the
astral
realms
know
a
happy
harmony
and
equality
astral
beings
dematerialize
or
materialize
their
forms
at
will
flowers
or
fish
or
animals
can
metamorphose
themselves
for
a
time
into
astral
men
all
astral
beings
are
free
to
assume
any
form
and
can
easily
commune
together
no
fixed
definite
natural
law
hems
them
astral
tree
for
example
can
be

they

three

two
of
which
are
partly

the

sri

replied
astral

therefore
attach
little
importance
to
facial
features
they
have
the
privilege
however
of
costuming
themselves
at
will
with
new
colorful
astrally
materialized
bodies
just
as
worldly
men
don
new
array
for
gala

so
astral

to
bedeck
themselves
in
specially
designed
forms
joyous
astral

hiranyaloka
take
place
when
a

is
liberated
from
the
astral

through
spiritual
advancement
and
is
therefore
ready
to
enter
the
heaven
of
the
causal

on
such
occasions
the
invisible
heavenly
father
and
the
saints
who
are
merged
in
him
materialize
themselves
into

at
the

they
realize
the
indestructibility
of
love
often
doubted
at
the
time
of
the
sad
delusive
partings
of
earthly
life
the
intuition
of
astral

pierces
through
the

and
observes
human
activities
on

but
man
can
not

unless
his

somewhat
developed
thousands

the

on

remain
mostly
awake
in
ecstasy
during
the
long
astral
day
and
night
helping
to
work
out
intricate
problems
of
cosmic
government
and
the
redemption
of
prodigal
sons
earthbound
souls
when
the
hiranyaloka

sleep
they
have
occasional
dreamlike
astral
visions
their

are
usually
engrossed
in
the
conscious
state
of
highest
nirbikalpa
bliss
inhabitants
in
all
parts
of
the
astral
worlds
are
still
subject
to
mental
agonies
the
sensitive
minds
of
the
higher
beings
on
planets
like
hiranyaloka
feel
keen
pain
if
any
mistake
is
made
in
conduct
or
perception
of
truth
these
advanced
beings
endeavor
to
attune
their
every
act
and
thought
with
the
perfection
of
spiritual
law
communication
among
the
astral
inhabitants
is
held
entirely
by
astral
telepathy
and
television
there
is
none
of
the
confusion
and
misunderstanding
of
the
written
and
spoken
word
which
must
endure
just
as
persons
on
the
cinema
screen
appear
to
move
and
act
through
a
series
of
light
pictures
and
do
not
actually
breathe
so
the
astral
beings
walk
and
work
as
intelligently
guided
and
coordinated
images
of
light
without
the
necessity
of
drawing
power
from
oxygen
man
depends
upon
solids
liquids
gases
and
energy
for
sustenance
astral
beings
sustain
themselves
principally
by
cosmic
light
master
mine
do
astral
beings
eat
anything
i
was
drinking
in
his
marvelous
elucidations
with
the
receptivity
of
all
my
heart
soul
superconscious
perceptions
of
truth
are
permanently
real
and
changeless
while
fleeting
sense
experiences
and
impressions
are
never
more
than
temporarily
or
relatively
true
and
soon
lose
in
memory
all
their
vividness
my
guru
words
were
so
penetratingly
imprinted
on
the
parchment
of
my
being
that
at
any
time
by
transferring
my
mind
to
the
superconscious
state
i
can
clearly
relive
the
divine
experience
luminous
raylike
vegetables
abound
in
the
astral
soils
he
answered
the
astral
beings
consume
vegetables
and
drink
a
nectar
flowing
from
glorious
fountains
of
light
and
from
astral
brooks
and
rivers
just
as
invisible
images
of
persons
on
the
earth
can
be
dug
out
of
the
ether
and
made
visible
by
a
television
apparatus
later
being
dismissed
again
into
space
so
the
unseen
astral
blueprints
of
vegetables
and
plants
floating
in
the
ether
are
precipitated
on
an
astral
planet
by
the
will
of
its
inhabitants
in
the
same
way
from
the
wildest
fancy
of
these
beings
whole
gardens
of
fragrant
flowers
are
materialized
returning
later
to
the
etheric
invisibility
although
dwellers
on
the
heavenly
planets
like
hiranyaloka
are
almost
freed
from
any
necessity
of
eating
still
higher
is
the
unconditioned
existence
of
almost
completely
liberated
souls
in
the
causal
world
who
eat
nothing
save
the
manna
of
bliss
the
astral
being
meets
a
multitude
of
relatives
fathers
mothers
wives
husbands
and
friends
acquired
during
different
incarnations
on
earth
as
they
appear
from
time
to
time
in
various
parts
of
the
astral
realms
he
is
therefore
at
a
loss
to
understand
whom
to
love
especially
he
learns
in
this
way
to
give
a
divine
and
equal
love
to
all
as
children
and
individualized
expressions
of
god
though
the
outward
appearance
of
loved
ones
may
have
changed
more
or
less
according
to
the
development
of
new
qualities
in
the
latest
life
of
any
particular
soul
the
astral
being
employs
his
unerring
intuition
to
recognize
all
those
once
dear
to
him
in
other
planes
of
existence
and
to
welcome
them
to
their
new
astral
home
because
every
atom
in
creation
is
inextinguishably
dowered
with
individuality
an
astral
friend
will
be
recognized
no
matter
what
costume
he
may
don
even
as
on
earth
an
actor
identity
is
discoverable
by
close
observation
despite
any
disguise
the
span
of
life
in
the
astral
world
is
much
longer
than
on
earth
a
normal
advanced
astral
being
average
life
period
is
from
five
hundred
to
one
thousand
years
measured
in
accordance
with
earthly
standards
of
time
as
certain
redwood
trees
outlive
most
trees
by
millenniums
or
as
some
yogis
live
several
hundred
years
though
most
men
die
before
the
age
of
sixty
so
some
astral
beings
live
much
longer
than
the
usual
span
of
astral
existence
visitors
to
the
astral
world
dwell
there
for
a
longer
or
shorter
period
in
accordance
with
the
weight
of
their
physical
karma
which
draws
them
back
to
earth
within
a
specified
time
the
astral
being
does
not
have
to
contend
painfully
with
death
at
the
time
of
shedding
his
luminous
body
many
of
these
beings
nevertheless
feel
slightly
nervous
at
the
thought
of
dropping
their
astral
form
for
the
subtler
causal
one
the
astral
world
is
free
from
unwilling
death
disease
and
old
age
these
three
dreads
are
the
curse
of
earth
where
man
has
allowed
his
consciousness
to
identify
itself
almost
wholly
with
a
frail
physical
body
requiring
constant
aid
from
air
food
and
sleep
in
order
to
exist
at
all
physical
death
is
attended
by
the
disappearance
of
breath
and
the
disintegration
of
fleshly
cells
astral
death
consists
of
the
dispersement
of
lifetrons
those
manifest
units
of
energy
which
constitute
the
life
of
astral
beings
at
physical
death
a
being
loses
his
consciousness
of
flesh
and
becomes
aware
of
his
subtle
body
in
the
astral
world
experiencing
astral
death
in
due
time
a
being
thus
passes
from
the
consciousness
of
astral
birth
and
death
to
that
of
physical
birth
and
death
these
recurrent
cycles
of
astral
and
physical
encasement
are
the
ineluctable
destiny
of
all
unenlightened
beings
scriptural
definitions
of
heaven
and
hell
sometimes
stir
man
memories
of
his
long
series
of
experiences
in
the
blithesome
astral
and
disappointing
terrestrial
worlds
beloved
master
i
asked
will
you
please
describe
more
in
detail
the
difference
between
rebirth
on
the
earth
and
in
the
astral
and
causal
spheres
man
as
an
individualized
soul
is
essentially
my
guru
explained
that
body
is
a
matrix
of
the
ideas
required
by
god
as
the
basic
or
causal
thought
forces
from
which
he
later
formed
the
subtle
astral
body
of
nineteen
elements
and
the
gross
physical
body
of
sixteen
elements
the
nineteen
elements
of
the
astral
body
are
mental
emotional
and
lifetronic
the
nineteen
components
are
intelligence
ego
feeling
mind
five
instruments
of
knowledge
the
subtle
counterparts
of
the
senses
of
sight
hearing
smell
taste
touch
five
instruments
of
action
the
mental
correspondence
for
the
executive
abilities
to
procreate
excrete
talk
walk
and
exercise
manual
skill
and
five
instruments
of
life
force
those
empowered
to
perform
the
crystallizing
assimilating
eliminating
metabolizing
and
circulating
functions
of
the
body
this
subtle
astral
encasement
of
nineteen
elements
survives
the
death
of
the
physical
body
which
is
made
of
sixteen
gross
metallic
and
nonmetallic
elements
god
thought
out
different
ideas
within
himself
and
projected
them
into
dreams
lady
cosmic
dream
thus
sprang
out
decorated
in
all
her
colossal
endless
ornaments
of
relativity
in
thought
categories
of
the
causal
body
god
elaborated
all
the
complexities
of
man
nineteen
astral
and
sixteen
physical
counterparts
by
condensation
of
vibratory
forces
first
subtle
then
gross
he
produced
man
astral
body
and
finally
his
physical
form
according
to
the
law
of
relativity
by
which
the
prime
simplicity
has
become
the
bewildering
manifold
the
causal
cosmos
and
causal
body
are
different
from
the
astral
cosmos
and
astral
body
the
physical
cosmos
and
physical
body
are
likewise
characteristically
at
variance
with
the
other
forms
of
creation
the
fleshly
body
is
made
of
the
fixed
objectified
dreams
of
the
creator
the
dualities
are
on
earth
disease
and
health
pain
and
pleasure
loss
and
gain
human
beings
find
limitation
and
resistance
in
matter
when
man
desire
to
live
is
severely
shaken
by
disease
or
other
causes
death
arrives
the
heavy
overcoat
of
the
flesh
is
temporarily
shed
the
soul
however
remains
encased
in
the
astral
and
causal
bodies
the
adhesive
force
by
which
all
three
bodies
are
held
together
is
desire
the
power
of
unfulfilled
desires
is
the
root
of
all
man
slavery
physical
desires
are
rooted
in
egotism
and
sense
pleasures
the
compulsion
or
temptation
of
sensory
experience
is
more
powerful
than
the
connected
with
astral
attachments
or
causal
perceptions
astral
desires
center
around
enjoyment
in
terms
of
vibration
astral
beings
enjoy
the
ethereal
music
of
the
spheres
and
are
entranced
by
the
sight
of
all
creation
as
exhaustless
expressions
of
changing
light
the
astral
beings
also
smell
taste
and
touch
light
astral
desires
are
thus
connected
with
an
astral
being
power
to
precipitate
all
objects
and
experiences
as
forms
of
light
or
as
condensed
thoughts
or
dreams
causal
desires
are
fulfilled
by
perception
only
the
beings
who
are
encased
only
in
the
causal
body
see
the
whole
universe
as
realizations
of
the
of
god
they
can
materialize
anything
and
everything
in
sheer
thought
causal
beings
therefore
consider
the
enjoyment
of
physical
sensations
or
astral
delights
as
gross
and
suffocating
to
the
soul
fine
sensibilities
causal
beings
work
out
their
desires
by
materializing
them
instantly
those
who
find
themselves
covered
only
by
the
delicate
veil
of
the
causal
body
can
bring
universes
into
manifestation
even
as
the
creator
because
all
creation
is
made
of
the
cosmic
the
soul
thinly
clothed
in
the
causal
has
vast
realizations
of
power
a
soul
being
invisible
by
nature
can
be
distinguished
only
by
the
presence
of
its
body
or
bodies
the
mere
presence
of
a
body
signifies
that
its
existence
is
made
possible
by
unfulfilled
desires
so
long
as
the
soul
of
man
is
encased
in
one
two
or
three
sealed
tightly
with
the
corks
of
ignorance
and
desires
he
can
not
merge
with
the
sea
of
spirit
when
the
gross
physical
receptacle
is
destroyed
by
the
hammer
of
death
the
other
two
and
remain
to
prevent
the
soul
from
consciously
joining
the
omnipresent
life
when
desirelessness
is
attained
through
wisdom
its
power
disintegrates
the
two
remaining
vessels
the
tiny
human
soul
emerges
free
at
last
it
is
one
with
the
measureless
amplitude
i
asked
my
divine
guru
to
shed
further
light
on
the
high
and
mysterious
causal
world
the
causal
world
is
indescribably
subtle
he
replied
in
order
to
understand
it
one
would
have
to
possess
such
tremendous
powers
of
concentration
that
he
could
close
his
eyes
and
visualize
the
astral
cosmos
and
the
physical
cosmos
in
all
their
luminous
balloon
with
the
solid
existing
in
ideas
only
if
by
this
superhuman
concentration
one
succeeded
in
converting
or
resolving
the
two
cosmoses
with
all
their
complexities
into
sheer
ideas
he
would
then
reach
the
causal
world
and
stand
on
the
borderline
of
fusion
between
mind
and
matter
there
one
perceives
all
created
things
solids
liquids
gases
electricity
energy
all
beings
gods
men
animals
plants
forms
of
consciousness
just
as
a
man
can
close
his
eyes
and
realize
that
he
exists
even
though
his
body
is
invisible
to
his
physical
eyes
and
is
present
only
as
an
idea
whatever
a
human
being
can
do
in
fancy
a
causal
being
can
do
in
reality
the
most
colossal
imaginative
human
intelligence
is
able
in
mind
only
to
range
from
one
extreme
of
thought
to
another
to
skip
mentally
from
planet
to
planet
or
tumble
endlessly
down
a
pit
of
eternity
or
soar
rocketlike
into
the
galaxied
canopy
or
scintillate
like
a
searchlight
over
milky
ways
and
the
starry
spaces
but
beings
in
the
causal
world
have
a
much
greater
freedom
and
can
effortlessly
manifest
their
thoughts
into
instant
objectivity
without
any
material
or
astral
obstruction
or
karmic
limitation
causal
beings
realize
that
the
physical
cosmos
is
not
primarily
constructed
of
electrons
nor
is
the
astral
cosmos
basically
composed
of
in
reality
are
created
from
the
minutest
particles
of
chopped
and
divided
by
maya
the
law
of
relativity
which
intervenes
to
apparently
separate
the
noumenon
from
his
phenomena
souls
in
the
causal
world
recognize
one
another
as
individualized
points
of
joyous
spirit
their
are
the
only
objects
which
surround
them
causal
beings
see
the
difference
between
their
bodies
and
thoughts
to
be
merely
ideas
as
a
man
closing
his
eyes
can
visualize
a
dazzling
white
light
or
a
faint
blue
haze
so
causal
beings
by
thought
alone
are
able
to
see
hear
feel
taste
and
touch
they
create
anything
or
dissolve
it
by
the
power
of
cosmic
mind
both
death
and
rebirth
in
the
causal
world
are
in
thought
beings
feast
only
on
the

the
of
bliss
lo
see
their
bright
zoom
past
trillions
of
planets
fresh
bubbles
of
universes
spectral
dreams
of
golden
nebulae
all
over
the
skiey
blue
bosom
of
infinity
many
beings
remain
for
thousands
of
years
in
the
causal
cosmos
by
deeper
ecstasies
the
freed
soul
then
withdraws
itself
from
the
little
causal
body
and
puts
on
the
vastness
of
the
causal
cosmos
all
the
separate
eddies
of
ideas
particularized
waves
of
power

joy

calmness

melt
into
the

no
longer
does
the
soul
have
to
experience
its
joy
as
an
individualized
wave
of
consciousness
but
is
merged
in
the
one
cosmic
ocean
with
all
its
laughter
thrills
throbs
when
a
soul
is
out
of
the
cocoon
of
the
three
bodies
it
escapes
forever
from
the
law
of
relativity
and
becomes
the
ineffable
behold
the
butterfly
of
omnipresence
its
wings
etched
with
stars
and
moons
and
suns
the
soul
expanded
into
spirit
remains
alone
in
the
region
of
lightless
light
darkless
dark

intoxicated
with
its
ecstasy

a

i
ejaculated
in
awe
when
a
soul
finally
gets
out
of
the
three
jars
of
bodily
delusions
master
continued
it
becomes
one
with
the
infinite
without
any
loss
of
individuality
christ
had
won
this
final
freedom
even
before
he
was
born
as
jesus
in
three
stages
of
his
past
symbolized
in
his
as
the
three
days
of
his
experience
of
death
and
resurrection
he
had
attained
the
power
to
fully
arise
in
spirit
the
undeveloped
man
must
undergo
countless
earthly
and
astral
and
causal
incarnations
in
order
to
emerge
from
his
three
bodies
a
master
who
achieves
this
final
freedom
may
elect
to
return
to
earth
as
a
prophet
to
bring
other
human
beings
back
to
god
or
like
myself
he
may
choose
to
reside
in
the
astral
cosmos
there
a
savior
assumes
some
of
the
burden
of
the
inhabitants
karma
and
thus
helps
them
to
terminate
their
cycle
of
reincarnation
in
the
astral
cosmos
and
go
on
permanently
to
the
causal
spheres
or
a
freed
soul
may
enter
the
causal
world
to
aid
its
beings
to
shorten
their
span
in
the
causal
body
and
thus
attain
the
absolute
freedom
resurrected
one
i
want
to
know
more
about
the
karma
which
forces
souls
to
return
to
the
three
worlds
i
could
listen
forever
i
thought
to
my
omniscient
master
never
in
his
had
i
been
able
at
one
time
to
assimilate
so
much
of
his
wisdom
now
for
the
first
time
i
was
receiving
a
clear
definite
insight
into
the
enigmatic
interspaces
on
the
checkerboard
of
life
and
death
the
physical
karma
or
desires
of
man
must
be
completely
worked
out
before
his
permanent
stay
in
astral
worlds
becomes
possible
my
guru
elucidated
in
his
thrilling
voice
two
kinds
of
beings
live
in
the
astral
spheres
those
who
still
have
earthly
karma
to
dispose
of
and
who
must
therefore
reinhabit
a
gross
physical
body
in
order
to
pay
their
karmic
debts
could
be
classified
after
physical
death
as
temporary
visitors
to
the
astral
world
rather
than
as
permanent
residents
beings
with
unredeemed
earthly
karma
are
not
permitted
after
astral
death
to
go
to
the
high
causal
sphere
of
cosmic
ideas
but
must
shuttle
to
and
fro
from
the
physical
and
astral
worlds
only
conscious
successively
of
their
physical
body
of
sixteen
gross
elements
and
of
their
astral
body
of
nineteen
subtle
elements
after
each
loss
of
his
physical
body
however
an
undeveloped
being
from
the
earth
remains
for
the
most
part
in
the
deep
stupor
of
the
and
is
hardly
conscious
of
the
beautiful
astral
sphere
after
the
astral
rest
such
a
man
returns
to
the
material
plane
for
further
lessons
gradually
accustoming
himself
through
repeated
journeys
to
the
worlds
of
subtle
astral
texture
normal
or
residents
of
the
astral
universe
on
the
other
hand
are
those
who
freed
forever
from
all
material
longings
need
return
no
more
to
the
gross
vibrations
of
earth
such
beings
have
only
astral
and
causal
karma
to
work
out
at
astral
death
these
beings
pass
to
the
infinitely
finer
and
more
delicate
causal
world
shedding
the
of
the
causal
body
at
the
end
of
a
certain
span
determined
by
cosmic
law
these
advanced
beings
then
return
to
hiranyaloka
or
a
similar
high
astral
planet
reborn
in
a
new
astral
body
to
work
out
their
unredeemed
astral
karma
my
son
you
may
now
comprehend
more
fully
that
i
am
resurrected
by
divine
decree
sri
yukteswar
continued
as
a
savior
of
astrally
reincarnating
souls
coming
back
from
the
causal
sphere
in
particular
rather
than
of
those
astral
beings
who
are
coming
up
from
the
earth
those
from
the
earth
if
they
still
retain
vestiges
of
material
karma
do
not
rise
to
the
very
high
astral
planets
like
hiranyaloka
just
as
most
people
on
earth
have
not
learned
through
vision
to
appreciate
the
superior
joys
and
advantages
of
astral
life
and
thus
after
death
desire
to
return
to
the
limited
imperfect
pleasures
of
earth
so
many
astral
beings
during
the
normal
disintegration
of
their
astral
bodies
fail
to
picture
the
advanced
state
of
spiritual
joy
in
the
causal
world
and
dwelling
on
thoughts
of
the
more
gross
and
gaudy
astral
happiness
yearn
to
revisit
the
astral
paradise
heavy
astral
karma
must
be
redeemed
by
such
beings
before
they
can
achieve
after
astral
death
a
permanent
stay
in
the
causal
so
thinly
partitioned
from
the
creator
only
when
a
being
has
no
further
desires
for
experiences
in
the
astral
cosmos
and
can
not
be
tempted
to
go
back
there
does
he
remain
in
the
causal
world
completing
there
the
work
of
redeeming
all
causal
karma
or
seeds
of
past
desires
the
confined
soul
thrusts
out
the
last
of
the
three
corks
of
ignorance
and
emerging
from
the
final
jar
of
the
causal
body
commingles
with
the
eternal
now
do
you
understand
master
smiled
so
enchantingly
yes
through
your
grace
i
am
speechless
with
joy
and
gratitude
never
from
song
or
story
had
i
ever
received
such
inspiring
knowledge
though
the
hindu
scriptures
refer
to
the
causal
and
astral
worlds
and
to
man
three
bodies
how
remote
and
meaningless
those
pages
compared
with
the
warm
authenticity
of
my
resurrected
master
for
him
indeed
existed
not
a
single
undiscover
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
the
interpenetration
of
man
three
bodies
is
expressed
in
many
ways
through
his
threefold
nature
my
great
guru
went
on
in
the
wakeful
state
on
earth
a
human
being
is
conscious
more
or
less
of
his
three
vehicles
when
he
is
sensuously
intent
on
tasting
smelling
touching
listening
or
seeing
he
is
working
principally
through
his
physical
body
visualizing
or
willing
he
is
working
mainly
through
his
astral
body
his
causal
medium
finds
expression
when
man
is
thinking
or
diving
deep
in
introspection
or
meditation
the
cosmical
thoughts
of
genius
come
to
the
man
who
habitually
contacts
his
causal
body
in
this
sense
an
individual
may
be
classified
broadly
as
material
man
energetic
man
or
intellectual
man
a
man
identifies
himself
about
sixteen
hours
daily
with
his
physical
vehicle
then
he
sleeps
if
he
dreams
he
remains
in
his
astral
body
effortlessly
creating
any
object
even
as
do
the
astral
beings
if
man
sleep
be
deep
and
dreamless
for
several
hours
he
is
able
to
transfer
his
consciousness
or
sense
of
to
the
causal
body
such
sleep
is
revivifying
a
dreamer
is
contacting
his
astral
and
not
his
causal
body
his
sleep
is
not
fully
refreshing
i
had
been
lovingly
observing
sri
yukteswar
while
he
gave
his
wondrous
exposition
angelic
guru
i
said
your
body
looks
exactly
as
it
did
when
last
i
wept
over
it
in
the
puri
ashram
o
yes
my
new
body
is
a
perfect
copy
of
the
old
one
i
materialize
or
dematerialize
this
form
any
time
at
will
much
more
frequently
than
i
did
while
on
earth
by
quick
dematerialization
i
now
travel
instantly
by
light
express
from
planet
to
planet
or
indeed
from
astral
to
causal
or
to
physical
cosmos
my
divine
guru
smiled
though
you
move
about
so
fast
these
days
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
you
at
bombay
o
master
i
was
grieving
so
deeply
about
your
death
ah
wherein
did
i
die
is
there
some
contradiction
sri
yukteswar
eyes
were
twinkling
with
love
and
amusement
you
were
only
dreaming
on
earth
on
that
earth
you
saw
my
he
went
on
later
you
buried
that
now
my
finer
fleshly
you
behold
and
are
even
now
embracing
rather
closely
resurrected
on
another
finer
of
god
someday
that
finer
and
finer
will
pass
away
they
too
are
not
forever
all
must
eventually
burst
at
a
final
wakeful
touch
differentiate
my
son
yogananda
between
dreams
and
reality
this
idea
of
vedantic
resurrection
struck
me
with
wonder
i
was
ashamed
that
i
had
pitied
master
when
i
had
seen
his
lifeless
body
at
puri
i
comprehended
at
last
that
my
guru
had
always
been
fully
awake
in
god
perceiving
his
own
life
and
passing
on
earth
and
his
present
resurrection
as
nothing
more
than
relativities
of
divine
ideas
in
the
cosmic
dream
i
have
now
told
you
yogananda
the
truths
of
my
life
death
and
resurrection
grieve
not
for
me
rather
broadcast
everywhere
the
story
of
my
resurrection
from
the
earth
of
men
to
another
planet
of
astrally
garbed
souls
new
hope
will
be
infused
into
the
hearts
of
dreamers
of
the
world
yes
master
how
willingly
would
i
share
with
others
my
joy
at
his
resurrection
on
earth
my
standards
were
uncomfortably
high
unsuited
to
the
natures
of
most
men
often
i
scolded
you
more
than
i
should
have
you
passed
my
test
your
love
shone
through
the
clouds
of
all
reprimands
he
added
tenderly
i
have
also
come
today
to
tell
you
never
again
shall
i
wear
the
stern
gaze
of
censure
i
shall
scold
you
no
more
how
much
i
had
missed
the
chastisements
of
my
great
guru
each
one
had
been
a
guardian
angel
of
protection
dearest
master
rebuke
me
a
million
scold
me
now
i
shall
chide
you
no
more
his
divine
voice
was
grave
yet
with
an
undercurrent
of
laughter
you
and
i
shall
smile
together
so
long
as
our
two
forms
appear
different
in
the
of
god
finally
we
shall
merge
as
one
in
the
cosmic
beloved
our
smiles
shall
be
his
smile
our
unified
song
of
joy
vibrating
throughout
eternity
to
be
broadcast
to
souls
sri
yukteswar
gave
me
light
on
certain
matters
which
i
can
not
reveal
here
during
the
two
hours
that
he
spent
with
me
in
the
bombay
hotel
room
he
answered
my
every
question
a
number
of
world
prophecies
uttered
by
him
that
june
day
in
have
already
come
to
pass
i
leave
you
now
beloved
one
at
these
words
i
felt
master
melting
away
within
my
encircling
arms
my
child
his
voice
rang
out
vibrating
into
my
very
whenever
you
enter
the
door
of
nirbikalpa
samadhi
and
call
on
me
i
shall
come
to
you
in
flesh
and
blood
even
as
today
with
this
celestial
promise
sri
yukteswar
vanished
from
my
sight
a
repeated
in
musical
thunder
tell
all
whosoever
knows
by
nirbikalpa
realization
that
your
earth
is
a
dream
of
god
can
come
to
the
finer
planet
of
hiranyaloka
and
there
find
me
resurrected
in
a
body
exactly
like
my
earthly
one
yogananda
tell
all
gone
was
the
sorrow
of
parting
the
pity
and
grief
for
his
death
long
robber
of
my
peace
now
fled
in
stark
shame
bliss
poured
forth
like
a
fountain
through
endless
newly
opened
anciently
clogged
with
disuse
they
now
widened
in
purity
at
the
driving
flood
of
ecstasy
subconscious
thoughts
and
feelings
of
my
past
incarnations
shed
their
karmic
taints
lustrously
renewed
by
sri
yukteswar
divine
visit
in
this
chapter
of
my
autobiography
i
have
obeyed
my
guru
behest
and
spread
the
glad
tiding
though
it
confound
once
more
an
incurious
generation
groveling
man
knows
well
despair
is
seldom
alien
yet
these
are
perversities
no
part
of
man
true
lot
the
day
he
wills
he
is
set
on
the
path
to
freedom
too
long
has
he
hearkened
to
the
dank
pessimism
of
his
counselors
heedless
of
the
unconquerable
soul
i
was
not
the
only
one
privileged
to
behold
the
resurrected
guru
one
of
sri
yukteswar
chelas
was
an
aged
woman
affectionately
known
as
ma
mother
whose
home
was
close
to
the
puri
hermitage
master
had
often
stopped
to
chat
with
her
during
his
morning
walk
on
the
evening
of
march
ma
arrived
at
the
ashram
and
asked
to
see
her
guru
why
master
died
a
week
ago
swami
sebananda
now
in
charge
of
the
puri
hermitage
looked
at
her
sadly
that
impossible
she
smiled
a
little
perhaps
you
are
just
trying
to
protect
the
guru
from
insistent
visitors
no
sebananda
recounted
details
of
the
burial
come
he
said
i
will
take
you
to
the
front
garden
to
sri
yukteswarji
grave
ma
shook
her
head
there
is
no
grave
for
him
this
morning
at
ten
he
passed
in
his
usual
walk
before
my
door
i
talked
to
him
for
several
minutes
in
the
bright
outdoors
this
evening
to
the
ashram
he
said
i
am
here
blessings
pour
on
this
old
gray
head
the
deathless
guru
wanted
me
to
understand
in
what
transcendent
body
he
had
visited
me
this
morning
the
astounded
sebananda
knelt
before
her
ma
he
said
what
a
weight
of
grief
you
lift
from
my
heart
he
is
risen
in
sabikalpa
samadhi
the
devotee
has
spiritually
progressed
to
a
state
of
inward
divine
union
but
can
not
maintain
his
cosmic
consciousness
except
in
the
immobile
by
continuous
meditation
he
reaches
the
superior
state
of
nirbikalpa
samadhi
where
he
moves
freely
in
the
world
and
performs
his
outward
duties
without
any
loss
of
sri
yukteswar
used
the
word
prana
i
have
translated
it
as
lifetrons
the
hindu
scriptures
refer
not
only
to
the
anu
atom
and
to
the
paramanu
beyond
the
atom
finer
electronic
energies
but
also
to
prana
creative
lifetronic
force
atoms
and
electrons
are
blind
forces
prana
is
inherently
intelligent
the
pranic
lifetrons
in
the
spermatozoa
and
ova
for
instance
guide
the
embryonic
development
according
to
a
karmic
design
adjective
of
mantra
chanted
discharged
by
the
mental
gun
of
concentration
the
puranas
ancient
shastras
or
treatises
describe
these
mantric
wars
between
devas
and
asuras
gods
and
demons
an
asura
once
tried
to
slay
a
deva
with
a
potent
chant
but
due
to
mispronunciation
the
mental
bomb
acted
as
a
boomerang
and
killed
the
demon
examples
of
such
powers
are
not
wanting
even
on
earth
as
in
the
case
of
helen
keller
and
other
rare
beings
lord
buddha
was
once
asked
why
a
man
should
love
all
persons
equally
because
the
great
teacher
replied
in
the
very
numerous
and
varied
lifespans
of
each
man
every
other
being
has
at
one
time
or
another
been
dear
to
him
the
eight
elemental
qualities
which
enter
into
all
created
life
from
atom
to
man
are
earth
water
fire
air
ether
motion
mind
and
individuality
bhagavad
gita
body
signifies
any
whether
gross
or
subtle
the
three
bodies
are
cages
for
the
bird
of
paradise
even
as
babaji
helped
lahiri
mahasaya
to
rid
himself
of
a
subconscious
desire
from
some
past
life
for
a
palace
as
described
in
chapter
and
he
said
unto
them
wheresoever
the
body
is
thither
will
the
eagles
be
gathered
together
wherever
the
soul
is
encased
in
the
physical

or
in
the
astral
body
or
in
the
causal
body
there
the
eagles
of

on

or
on
astral
and

also
gather
to
keep

him
that
overcometh
will
i
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
throne
even
as
i
also
overcame
and
am
set
down
with
my
father
in
his
throne
sri
yukteswar
was
signifying
that
even
as
in
his
earthly
incarnation
he
had
occasionally
assumed
the
weight
of
disease
to
lighten
his
disciples
karma
so
in
the
astral
world
his
mission
as
a
savior
enabled
him
to
take
on
certain
astral
karma
of
dwellers
on
hiranyaloka
and
thus
hasten
their
evolution
into
the
higher
causal
world
life
and
death
as
relativities
of
thought
only
vedanta
points
out
that
god
is
the
only
reality
all
creation
or
separate
existence
is
maya
or
illusion
this
philosophy
of
monism
received
its
highest
expression
in
the
upanishad
commentaries
of
shankara
chapter
with
mahatma
gandhi
at
wardha
welcome
to
wardha
mahadev
desai
secretary
to
mahatma
gandhi
greeted
miss
bletch
wright
and
myself
with
these
cordial
words
and
the
gift
of
wreaths
of
khaddar
homespun
cotton
our
little
group
had
just
dismounted
at
the
wardha
station
on
an
early
morning
in
august
glad
to
leave
the
dust
and
heat
of
the
train
consigning
our
luggage
to
a
bullock
cart
we
entered
an
open
motor
car
with
desai
and
his
companions
babasaheb
deshmukh
and
pingale
a
short
drive
over
the
muddy
country
roads
brought
us
to
maganvadi
the
ashram
of
india
political
saint
desai
led
us
at
once
to
the
writing
room
where
sat
mahatma
gandhi
pen
in
one
hand
and
a
scrap
of
paper
in
the
other
on
his
face
a
vast
winning
smile
welcome
he
scribbled
in
hindi
it
was
a
monday
his
weekly
day
of
silence
though
this
was
our
first
meeting
we
beamed
on
each
other
affectionately
in
mahatma
gandhi
had
honored
the
ranchi
school
by
a
visit
and
had
inscribed
in
its
a
gracious
tribute
the
tiny
saint
radiated
physical
mental
and
spiritual
health
his
soft
brown
eyes
shone
with
intelligence
sincerity
and
discrimination
this
statesman
has
matched
wits
and
emerged
the
victor
in
a
thousand
legal
social
and
political
battles
no
other
leader
in
the
world
has
attained
the
secure
niche
in
the
hearts
of
his
people
that
gandhi
occupies
for
india
unlettered
millions
their
spontaneous
tribute
is
his
famous
great
soul
for
them
alone
gandhi
confines
his
attire
to
the
loincloth
symbol
of
his
oneness
with
the
downtrodden
masses
who
can
afford
no
more
illustration

the
mahatma
handed
me
this
note
as
desai
led
our
party
from
the
writing
room
toward
the
guest
house
our
guide
led
us
through
orchards
and
flowering
fields
to
a
building
with
latticed
windows
a
well
feet
across
was
used
desai
said
for
watering

stood
a
revolving
cement
wheel
for
threshing

each
of
our
small
bedrooms
proved
to
contain
only
the
irreducible
bed
handmade
of
rope
the
whitewashed
kitchen
boasted
a
faucet
in
one
corner
and
a
fire
pit
for
cooking
in
another
simple
arcadian
sounds
reached
our
cries
of
crows
and
sparrows
the
lowing
of
cattle
and
the
rap
of
chisels
being
used
to
chip
stones
observing
wright
travel
diary
desai
opened
a
page
and
wrote
on
it
a
list
of
satyagraha
vows
taken
by
all
the
mahatma
strict
followers
satyagrahis
nonviolence
truth
celibacy
control
of
the
palate
fearlessness
equal
respect
for
all
religions
swadeshi
use
of
home
manufactures
freedom
from
untouchability
these
eleven
should
be
observed
as
vows
in
a
spirit
of
humility
gandhi
himself
signed
this
page
on
the
following
day
giving
the
date
two
hours
after
our
arrival
my
companions
and
i
were
summoned
to
lunch
the
mahatma
was
already
seated
under
the
arcade
of
the
ashram
porch
across
the
courtyard
from
his
study
about
barefooted
satyagrahis
were
squatting
before
brass
cups
and
plates
a
community
chorus
of
prayer
then
a
meal
served
from
large
brass
pots
containing
chapatis
unleavened
bread
sprinkled
with
ghee
talsari
boiled
and
diced
vegetables
and
a
lemon
jam
the
mahatma
ate
chapatis
boiled
beets
some
raw
vegetables
and
oranges
on
the
side
of
his
plate
was
a
large
lump
of
very
bitter
neem
leaves
a
notable
blood
cleanser
with
his
spoon
he
separated
a
portion
and
placed
it
on
my
dish
i
bolted
it
down
with
water
remembering
childhood
days
when
mother
had
forced
me
to
swallow
the
disagreeable
dose
gandhi
however
bit
by
bit
was
eating
the
neem
paste
with
as
much
relish
as
if
it
had
been
a
delicious
sweetmeat
in
this
trifling
incident
i
noted
the
mahatma
ability
to
detach
his
mind
from
the
senses
at
will
i
recalled
the
famous
appendectomy
performed
on
him
some
years
ago
refusing
anesthetics
the
saint
had
chatted
cheerfully
with
his
disciples
throughout
the
operation
his
infectious
smile
revealing
his
unawareness
of
pain
the
afternoon
brought
an
opportunity
for
a
chat
with
gandhi
noted
disciple
daughter
of
an
english
admiral
miss
madeleine
slade
now
called
mirabai
her
strong
calm
face
lit
with
enthusiasm
as
she
told
me
in
flawless
hindi
of
her
daily
activities
rural
reconstruction
work
is
rewarding
a
group
of
us
go
every
morning
at
five
to
serve
the
villagers
and
teach
them
simple
hygiene
we
make
it
a
point
to
clean
their
latrines
and
their
huts
the
villagers
are
illiterate
they
can
not
be
educated
except
by
example
she
laughed
gaily
i
looked
in
admiration
at
this
highborn
englishwoman
whose
true
christian
humility
enables
her
to
do
the
scavengering
work
usually
performed
only
by
untouchables
i
came
to
india
in
she
told
me
in
this
land
i
feel
that
i
have
back
home
now
i
would
never
be
willing
to
return
to
my
old
life
and
old
interests
we
discussed
america
for
awhile
i
am
always
pleased
and
amazed
she
said
to
see
the
deep
interest
in
spiritual
subjects
exhibited
by
the
many
americans
who
visit
india
mirabai
hands
were
soon
busy
at
the
charka
spinning
wheel
omnipresent
in
all
the
ashram
rooms
and
indeed
due
to
the
mahatma
omnipresent
throughout
rural
india
gandhi
has
sound
economic
and
cultural
reasons
for
encouraging
the
revival
of
cottage
industries
but
he
does
not
counsel
a
fanatical
repudiation
of
all
modern
progress
machinery
trains
automobiles
the
telegraph
have
played
important
parts
in
his
own
colossal
life
fifty
years
of
public
service
in
prison
and
out
wrestling
daily
with
practical
details
and
harsh
realities
in
the
political
world
have
only
increased
his
balance
sanity
and
humorous
appreciation
of
the
quaint
human
spectacle
our
trio
enjoyed
a
six
supper
as
guests
of
babasaheb
deshmukh
the
prayer
hour
found
us
back
at
the
maganvadi
ashram
climbing
to
the
roof
where
thirty
satyagrahis
were
grouped
in
a
semicircle
around
gandhi
he
was
squatting
on
a
straw
mat
an
ancient
pocket
watch
propped
up
before
him
the
fading
sun
cast
a
last
gleam
over
the
palms
and
banyans
the
hum
of
night
and
the
crickets
had
started
the
atmosphere
was
serenity
itself
i
was
enraptured
a
solemn
chant
led
by
desai
with
responses
from
the
group
then
a
gita
reading
the
mahatma
motioned
to
me
to
give
the
concluding
prayer
such
divine
unison
of
thought
and
aspiration
a
memory
forever
the
wardha
roof
top
meditation
under
the
early
stars
punctually
at
eight
gandhi
ended
his
silence
the
herculean
labors
of
his
life
require
him
to
apportion
his
time
minutely
welcome
swamiji
the
mahatma
greeting
this
time
was
not
via
paper
we
had
just
descended
from
the
roof
to
his
writing
room
simply
furnished
with
square
mats
no
chairs
a
low
desk
with
books
papers
and
a
few
ordinary
pens
not
fountain
pens
a
nondescript
clock
ticked
in
a
corner
an
aura
of
peace
and
devotion
gandhi
was
bestowing
one
of
his
captivating
cavernous
almost
toothless
smiles
years
ago
he
explained
i
started
my
weekly
observance
of
a
day
of
silence
as
a
means
for
gaining
time
to
look
after
my
correspondence
but
now
those
hours
have
become
a
vital
spiritual
need
a
periodical
decree
of
silence
is
not
a
torture
but
a
blessing
i
agreed
wholeheartedly
the
mahatma
questioned
me
about
america
and
europe
we
discussed
india
and
world
conditions
mahadev
gandhi
said
as
desai
entered
the
room
please
make
arrangements
at
town
hall
for
swamiji
to
speak
there
on
yoga
tomorrow
night
as
i
was
bidding
the
mahatma
good
night
he
considerately
handed
me
a
bottle
of
citronella
oil
the
wardha
mosquitoes
do
know
a
thing
about
ahimsa
swamiji
he
said
laughing
the
following
morning
our
little
group
breakfasted
early
on
a
tasty
wheat
porridge
with
molasses
and
milk
at
we
were
called
to
the
ashram
porch
for
lunch
with
gandhi
and
the
satyagrahis
today
the
menu
included
brown
rice
a
new
selection
of
vegetables
and
cardamom
seeds
noon
found
me
strolling
about
the
ashram
grounds
on
to
the
grazing
land
of
a
few
imperturbable
cows
the
protection
of
cows
is
a
passion
with
gandhi
the
cow
to
me
means
the
entire
world
extending
sympathies
beyond
his
own
species
the
mahatma
has
explained
man
through
the
cow
is
enjoined
to
realize
his
identity
with
all
that
lives
why
the
ancient
rishis
selected
the
cow
for
apotheosis
is
obvious
to
me
the
cow
in
india
was
the
best
comparison
she
was
the
giver
of
plenty
not
only
did
she
give
milk
but
she
also
made
agriculture
possible
the
cow
is
a
poem
of
pity
one
reads
pity
in
the
gentle
animal
she
is
the
second
mother
to
millions
of
mankind
protection
of
the
cow
means
protection
of
the
whole
dumb
creation
of
god
the
appeal
of
the
lower
order
of
creation
is
all
the
more
forceful
because
it
is
speechless
three
daily
rituals
are
enjoined
on
the
orthodox
hindu
one
is
bhuta
yajna
an
offering
of
food
to
the
animal
kingdom
this
ceremony
symbolizes
man
realization
of
his
obligations
to
less
evolved
forms
of
creation
instinctively
tied
to
bodily
identifications
which
also
corrode
human
life
but
lacking
in
that
quality
of
liberating
reason
which
is
peculiar
to
humanity
bhuta
yajna
thus
reinforces
man
readiness
to
succor
the
weak
as
he
in
turn
is
comforted
by
countless
solicitudes
of
higher
unseen
beings
man
is
also
under
bond
for
rejuvenating
gifts
of
nature
prodigal
in
earth
sea
and
sky
the
evolutionary
barrier
of
incommunicability
among
nature
animals
man
and
astral
angels
is
thus
overcome
by
offices
of
silent
love
the
other
two
daily
yajnas
are
pitri
and
nri
pitri
yajna
is
an
offering
of
oblations
to
ancestors
as
a
symbol
of
man
acknowledgment
of
his
debt
to
the
past
essence
of
whose
wisdom
illumines
humanity
today
nri
yajna
is
an
offering
of
food
to
strangers
or
the
poor
symbol
of
the
present
responsibilities
of
man
his
duties
to
contemporaries
in
the
early
afternoon
i
fulfilled
a
neighborly
nri
yajna
by
a
visit
to
gandhi
ashram
for
little
girls
wright
accompanied
me
on
the
drive
tiny
young
flowerlike
faces
atop
the
colorful
saris
at
the
end
of
a
brief
talk
in
hindi
which
i
was
giving
outdoors
the
skies
unloosed
a
sudden
downpour
laughing
wright
and
i
climbed
aboard
the
car
and
sped
back
to
maganvadi
amidst
sheets
of
driving
silver
such
tropical
intensity
and
splash
reentering
the
guest
house
i
was
struck
anew
by
the
stark
simplicity
and
evidences
of
which
are
everywhere
present
the
gandhi
vow
of
came
early
in
his
married
life
renouncing
an
extensive
legal
practice
which
had
been
yielding
him
an
annual
income
of
more
than
the
mahatma
dispersed
all
his
wealth
to
the
poor
sri
yukteswar
used
to
poke
gentle
fun
at
the
commonly
inadequate
conceptions
of
renunciation
a
beggar
can
not
renounce
wealth
master
would
say
if
a
man
laments
business
has
failed
my
wife
has
left
me
i
will
renounce
all
and
enter
a
monastery
to
what
worldly
sacrifice
is
he
referring
he
did
not
renounce
wealth
and
love
they
renounced
him
saints
like
gandhi
on
the
other
hand
have
made
not
only
tangible
material
sacrifices
but
also
the
more
difficult
renunciation
of
selfish
motive
and
private
goal
merging
their
inmost
being
in
the
stream
of
humanity
as
a
whole
the
mahatma
remarkable
wife
kasturabai
did
not
object
when
he
failed
to
set
aside
any
part
of
his
wealth
for
the
use
of
herself
and
their
children
married
in
early
youth
gandhi
and
his
wife
took
the
vow
of
celibacy
after
the
birth
of
several
sons
a
tranquil
heroine
in
the
intense
drama
that
has
been
their
life
together
kasturabai
has
followed
her
husband
to
prison
shared
his
fasts
and
fully
borne
her
share
of
his
endless
responsibilities
she
has
paid
gandhi
the
following
tribute
i
thank
you
for
having
had
the
privilege
of
being
your
lifelong
companion
and
helpmate
i
thank
you
for
the
most
perfect
marriage
in
the
world
based
on
brahmacharya
and
not
on
sex
i
thank
you
for
having
considered
me
your
equal
in
your
life
work
for
india
i
thank
you
for
not
being
one
of
those
husbands
who
spend
their
time
in
gambling
racing
women
wine
and
song
tiring
of
their
wives
and
children
as
the
little
boy
quickly
tires
of
his
childhood
toys
how
thankful
i
am
that
you
were
not
one
of
those
husbands
who
devote
their
time
to
growing
rich
on
the
exploitation
of
the
labor
of
others
how
thankful
i
am
that
you
put
god
and
country
before
bribes
that
you
had
the
courage
of
your
convictions
and
a
complete
and
implicit
faith
in
god
how
thankful
i
am
for
a
husband
that
put
god
and
his
country
before
me
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
your
tolerance
of
me
and
my
shortcomings
of
youth
when
i
grumbled
and
rebelled
against
the
change
you
made
in
our
mode
of
living
from
so
much
to
so
little
as
a
young
child
i
lived
in
your
parents
home
your
mother
was
a
great
and
good
woman
she
trained
me
taught
me
how
to
be
a
brave
courageous
wife
and
how
to
keep
the
love
and
respect
of
her
son
my
future
husband
as
the
years
passed
and
you
became
india
most
beloved
leader
i
had
none
of
the
fears
that
beset
the
wife
who
may
be
cast
aside
when
her
husband
has
climbed
the
ladder
of
success
as
so
often
happens
in
other
countries
i
knew
that
death
would
still
find
us
husband
and
wife
for
years
kasturabai
performed
the
duties
of
treasurer
of
the
public
funds
which
the
idolized
mahatma
is
able
to
raise
by
the
millions
there
are
many
humorous
stories
in
indian
homes
to
the
effect
that
husbands
are
nervous
about
their
wives
wearing
any
jewelry
to
a
gandhi
meeting
the
mahatma
magical
tongue
pleading
for
the
downtrodden
charms
the
gold
bracelets
and
diamond
necklaces
right
off
the
arms
and
necks
of
the
wealthy
into
the
collection
basket
one
day
the
public
treasurer
kasturabai
could
not
account
for
a
disbursement
of
four
rupees
gandhi
duly
published
an
auditing
in
which
he
inexorably
pointed
out
his
wife
four
rupee
discrepancy
i
had
often
told
this
story
before
classes
of
my
american
students
one
evening
a
woman
in
the
hall
had
given
an
outraged
gasp
mahatma
or
no
mahatma
she
had
cried
if
he
were
my
husband
i
would
have
given
him
a
black
eye
for
such
an
unnecessary
public
insult
after
some
banter
had
passed
between
us
on
the
subject
of
american
wives
and
hindu
wives
i
had
gone
on
to
a
fuller
explanation
gandhi
considers
the
mahatma
not
as
her
husband
but
as
her
guru
one
who
has
the
right
to
discipline
her
for
even
insignificant
errors
i
had
pointed
out
sometime
after
kasturabai
had
been
publicly
rebuked
gandhi
was
sentenced
to
prison
on
a
political
charge
as
he
was
calmly
bidding
farewell
to
his
wife
she
fell
at
his
feet
she
said
humbly
i
have
ever
offended
you
please
forgive
me
at
three
that
afternoon
in
wardha
i
betook
myself
by
previous
appointment
to
the
writing
room
of
the
saint
who
had
been
able
to
make
an
unflinching
disciple
out
of
his
own
miracle
gandhi
looked
up
with
his
unforgettable
smile
mahatmaji
i
said
as
i
squatted
beside
him
on
the
uncushioned
mat
please
tell
me
your
definition
of
ahimsa
the
avoidance
of
harm
to
any
living
creature
in
thought
or
deed
beautiful
ideal
but
the
world
will
always
ask
may
one
not
kill
a
cobra
to
protect
a
child
or
one
self
i
could
not
kill
a
cobra
without
violating
two
of
my
vows
fearlessness
and
i
would
rather
try
inwardly
to
calm
the
snake
by
vibrations
of
love
i
can
not
possibly
lower
my
standards
to
suit
my
circumstances
with
his
amazing
candor
gandhi
added
i
must
confess
that
i
could
not
carry
on
this
conversation
were
i
faced
by
a
cobra
i
remarked
on
several
very
recent
western
books
on
diet
which
lay
on
his
desk
yes
diet
is
important
in
the
satyagraha
everywhere
else
he
said
with
a
chuckle
because
i
advocate
complete
continence
for
satyagrahis
i
am
always
trying
to
find
out
the
best
diet
for
the
celibate
one
must
conquer
the
palate
before
he
can
control
the
procreative
instinct
or
unbalanced
diets
are
not
the
answer
after
overcoming
the
inward
greed
for
food
a
satyagrahi
must
continue
to
follow
a
rational
vegetarian
diet
with
all
necessary
vitamins
minerals
calories
and
so
forth
by
inward
and
outward
wisdom
in
regard
to
eating
the
satyagrahi
sexual
fluid
is
easily
turned
into
vital
energy
for
the
whole
body
the
mahatma
and
i
compared
our
knowledge
of
good
the
avocado
is
excellent
i
said
there
are
numerous
avocado
groves
near
my
center
in
california
gandhi
face
lit
with
interest
i
wonder
if
they
would
grow
in
wardha
the
satyagrahis
would
appreciate
a
new
food
i
will
be
sure
to
send
some
avocado
plants
from
los
angeles
to
wardha
i
added
eggs
are
a
food
are
they
forbidden
to
satyagrahis
not
unfertilized
eggs
the
mahatma
laughed
reminiscently
for
years
i
would
not
countenance
their
use
even
now
i
personally
do
not
eat
them
one
of
my
was
once
dying
of
malnutrition
her
doctor
insisted
on
eggs
i
would
not
agree
and
advised
him
to
give
her
some
the
doctor
said
eggs
contain
no
life
sperm
no
killing
is
involved
i
then
gladly
gave
permission
for
my
to
eat
eggs
she
was
soon
restored
to
health
on
the
previous
night
gandhi
had
expressed
a
wish
to
receive
the
kriya
yoga
of
lahiri
mahasaya
i
was
touched
by
the
and
spirit
of
inquiry
he
is
childlike
in
his
divine
quest
revealing
that
pure
receptivity
which
jesus
praised
in
children
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
hour
for
my
promised
instruction
had
arrived
several
satyagrahis
now
entered
the
desai
pingale
and
a
few
others
who
desired
the
kriya
technique
i
first
taught
the
little
class
the
physical
yogoda
exercises
the
body
is
visualized
as
divided
into
twenty
parts
the
will
directs
energy
in
turn
to
each
section
soon
everyone
was
vibrating
before
me
like
a
human
motor
it
was
easy
to
observe
the
rippling
effect
on
gandhi
twenty
body
parts
at
all
times
completely
exposed
to
view
though
very
thin
he
is
not
unpleasingly
so
the
skin
of
his
body
is
smooth
and
unwrinkled
later
i
initiated
the
group
into
the
liberating
technique
of
kriya
yoga
the
mahatma
has
reverently
studied
all
world
religions
the
jain
scriptures
the
biblical
new
testament
and
the
sociological
writings
of
tolstoy
are
the
three
main
sources
of
nonviolent
convictions
he
has
stated
his
credo
thus
i
believe
the
bible
the
koran
and
the
to
be
as
divinely
inspired
as
the
vedas
i
believe
in
the
institution
of
gurus
but
in
this
age
millions
must
go
without
a
guru
because
it
is
a
rare
thing
to
find
a
combination
of
perfect
purity
and
perfect
learning
but
one
need
not
despair
of
ever
knowing
the
truth
of
one
religion
because
the
fundamentals
of
hinduism
as
of
every
great
religion
are
unchangeable
and
easily
understood
i
believe
like
every
hindu
in
god
and
his
oneness
in
rebirth
and
salvation
i
can
no
more
describe
my
feeling
for
hinduism
than
for
my
own
wife
she
moves
me
as
no
other
woman
in
the
world
can
not
that
she
has
no
faults
i
daresay
she
has
many
more
than
i
see
myself
but
the
feeling
of
an
indissoluble
bond
is
there
even
so
i
feel
for
and
about
hinduism
with
all
its
faults
and
limitations
nothing
delights
me
so
much
as
the
music
of
the
gita
or
the
ramayana
by
tulsidas
when
i
fancied
i
was
taking
my
last
breath
the
gita
was
my
solace
hinduism
is
not
an
exclusive
religion
in
it
there
is
room
for
the
worship
of
all
the
prophets
of
the
world
it
is
not
a
missionary
religion
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
it
has
no
doubt
absorbed
many
tribes
in
its
fold
but
this
absorption
has
been
of
an
evolutionary
imperceptible
character
hinduism
tells
each
man
to
worship
god
according
to
his
own
faith
or
dharma
and
so
lives
at
peace
with
all
religions
of
christ
gandhi
has
written
i
am
sure
that
if
he
were
living
here
now
among
men
he
would
bless
the
lives
of
many
who
perhaps
have
never
even
heard
his
name
just
as
it
is
written
every
one
that
saith
unto
me
lord
lord
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
father
in
the
lesson
of
his
own
life
jesus
gave
humanity
the
magnificent
purpose
and
the
single
objective
toward
which
we
all
ought
to
aspire
i
believe
that
he
belongs
not
solely
to
christianity
but
to
the
entire
world
to
all
lands
and
races
on
my
last
evening
in
wardha
i
addressed
the
meeting
which
had
been
called
by
desai
in
town
hall
the
room
was
thronged
to
the
window
sills
with
about
people
assembled
to
hear
the
talk
on
yoga
i
spoke
first
in
hindi
then
in
english
our
little
group
returned
to
the
ashram
in
time
for
a
glimpse
of
gandhi
enfolded
in
peace
and
correspondence
night
was
still
lingering
when
i
rose
at
village
life
was
already
stirring
first
a
bullock
cart
by
the
ashram
gates
then
a
peasant
with
his
huge
burden
balanced
precariously
on
his
head
after
breakfast
our
trio
sought
out
gandhi
for
farewell
pronams
the
saint
rises
at
four
for
his
morning
prayer
mahatmaji
i
knelt
to
touch
his
feet
india
is
safe
in
your
keeping
years
have
rolled
by
since
the
wardha
idyl
the
earth
oceans
and
skies
have
darkened
with
a
world
at
war
alone
among
great
leaders
gandhi
has
offered
a
practical
nonviolent
alternative
to
armed
might
to
redress
grievances
and
remove
injustices
the
mahatma
has
employed
nonviolent
means
which
again
and
again
have
proved
their
effectiveness
he
states
his
doctrine
in
these
words
i
have
found
that
life
persists
in
the
midst
of
destruction
therefore
there
must
be
a
higher
law
than
that
of
destruction
only
under
that
law
would
society
be
intelligible
and
life
worth
living
if
that
is
the
law
of
life
we
must
work
it
out
in
daily
existence
wherever
there
are
wars
wherever
we
are
confronted
with
an
opponent
conquer
by
love
i
have
found
that
the
certain
law
of
love
has
answered
in
my
own
life
as
the
law
of
destruction
has
never
done
in
india
we
have
had
an
ocular
demonstration
of
the
operation
of
this
law
on
the
widest
scale
possible
i
do
claim
that
nonviolence
has
penetrated
the
people
in
india
but
i
do
claim
it
has
penetrated
deeper
than
any
other
doctrine
in
an
incredibly
short
time
it
takes
a
fairly
strenuous
course
of
training
to
attain
a
mental
state
of
nonviolence
it
is
a
disciplined
life
like
the
life
of
a
soldier
the
perfect
state
is
reached
only
when
the
mind
body
and
speech
are
in
proper
coordination
every
problem
would
lend
itself
to
solution
if
we
determined
to
make
the
law
of
truth
and
nonviolence
the
law
of
life
just
as
a
scientist
will
work
wonders
out
of
various
applications
of
the
laws
of
nature
a
man
who
applies
the
laws
of
love
with
scientific
precision
can
work
greater
wonders
nonviolence
is
infinitely
more
wonderful
and
subtle
than
forces
of
nature
like
for
instance
electricity
the
law
of
love
is
a
far
greater
science
than
any
modern
science
consulting
history
one
may
reasonably
state
that
the
problems
of
mankind
have
not
been
solved
by
the
use
of
brute
force
world
war
i
produced
a
snowball
of
war
karma
that
swelled
into
world
war
ii
only
the
warmth
of
brotherhood
can
melt
the
present
colossal
snowball
of
war
karma
which
may
otherwise
grow
into
world
war
iii
this
unholy
trinity
will
banish
forever
the
possibility
of
world
war
iv
by
a
finality
of
atomic
bombs
use
of
jungle
logic
instead
of
human
reason
in
settling
disputes
will
restore
the
earth
to
a
jungle
if
brothers
not
in
life
then
brothers
in
violent
death
war
and
crime
never
pay
the
billions
of
dollars
that
went
up
in
the
smoke
of
explosive
nothingness
would
have
been
sufficient
to
have
made
a
new
world
one
almost
free
from
disease
and
completely
free
from
poverty
not
an
earth
of
fear
chaos
famine
pestilence
the
danse
macabre
but
one
broad
land
of
peace
of
prosperity
and
of
widening
knowledge
the
nonviolent
voice
of
gandhi
appeals
to
man
highest
conscience
let
nations
ally
themselves
no
longer
with
death
but
with
life
not
with
destruction
but
with
construction
not
with
the
annihilator
but
with
the
creator
one
should
forgive
under
any
injury
says
the
mahabharata
it
hath
been
said
that
the
continuation
of
species
is
due
to
man
being
forgiving
forgiveness
is
holiness
by
forgiveness
the
universe
is
held
together
forgiveness
is
the
might
of
the
mighty
forgiveness
is
sacrifice
forgiveness
is
quiet
of
mind
forgiveness
and
gentleness
are
the
qualities
of
the
they
represent
eternal
virtue
nonviolence
is
the
natural
outgrowth
of
the
law
of
forgiveness
and
love
if
loss
of
life
becomes
necessary
in
a
righteous
battle
gandhi
proclaims
one
should
be
prepared
like
jesus
to
shed
his
own
not
others
blood
eventually
there
will
be
less
blood
spilt
in
the
world
epics
shall
someday
be
written
on
the
indian
satyagrahis
who
withstood
hate
with
love
violence
with
nonviolence
who
allowed
themselves
to
be
mercilessly
slaughtered
rather
than
retaliate
the
result
on
certain
historic
occasions
was
that
the
armed
opponents
threw
down
their
guns
and
fled
shamed
shaken
to
their
depths
by
the
sight
of
men
who
valued
the
life
of
another
above
their
own
i
would
wait
if
need
be
for
ages
gandhi
says
rather
than
seek
the
freedom
of
my
country
through
bloody
means
never
does
the
mahatma
forget
the
majestic
warning
all
they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
sword
gandhi
has
written
i
call
myself
a
nationalist
but
my
nationalism
is
as
broad
as
the
universe
it
includes
in
its
sweep
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
my
nationalism
includes
the
of
the
whole
world
i
do
not
want
my
india
to
rise
on
the
ashes
of
other
nations
i
do
not
want
india
to
exploit
a
single
human
being
i
want
india
to
be
strong
in
order
that
she
can
infect
the
other
nations
also
with
her
strength
not
so
with
a
single
nation
in
europe
today
they
do
not
give
strength
to
the
others
president
wilson
mentioned
his
beautiful
fourteen
points
but
said
after
all
if
this
endeavor
of
ours
to
arrive
at
peace
fails
we
have
our
armaments
to
fall
back
upon
i
want
to
reverse
that
position
and
i
say
our
armaments
have
failed
already
let
us
now
be
in
search
of
something
new
let
us
try
the
force
of
love
and
god
which
is
truth
when
we
have
got
that
we
shall
want
nothing
else
by
the
mahatma
training
of
thousands
of
true
satyagrahis
those
who
have
taken
the
eleven
rigorous
vows
mentioned
in
the
first
part
of
this
chapter
who
in
turn
spread
the
message
by
patiently
educating
the
indian
masses
to
understand
the
spiritual
and
eventually
material
benefits
of
nonviolence
by
arming
his
people
with
nonviolent
weapons
with
injustice
the
willingness
to
endure
indignities
prison
death
itself
rather
than
resort
to
arms
by
enlisting
world
sympathy
through
countless
examples
of
heroic
martyrdom
among
satyagrahis
gandhi
has
dramatically
portrayed
the
practical
nature
of
nonviolence
its
solemn
power
to
settle
disputes
without
war
gandhi
has
already
won
through
nonviolent
means
a
greater
number
of
political
concessions
for
his
land
than
have
ever
been
won
by
any
leader
of
any
country
except
through
bullets
nonviolent
methods
for
eradication
of
all
wrongs
and
evils
have
been
strikingly
applied
not
only
in
the
political
arena
but
in
the
delicate
and
complicated
field
of
indian
social
reform
gandhi
and
his
followers
have
removed
many
longstanding
feuds
between
hindus
and
mohammedans
hundreds
of
thousands
of
moslems
look
to
the
mahatma
as
their
leader
the
untouchables
have
found
in
him
their
fearless
and
triumphant
champion
if
there
be
a
rebirth
in
store
for
me
gandhi
wrote
i
wish
to
be
born
a
pariah
in
the
midst
of
pariahs
because
thereby
i
would
be
able
to
render
them
more
effective
service
the
mahatma
is
indeed
a
great
soul
but
it
was
illiterate
millions
who
had
the
discernment
to
bestow
the
title
this
gentle
prophet
is
honored
in
his
own
land
the
lowly
peasant
has
been
able
to
rise
to
gandhi
high
challenge
the
mahatma
wholeheartedly
believes
in
the
inherent
nobility
of
man
the
inevitable
failures
have
never
disillusioned
him
even
if
the
opponent
plays
him
false
twenty
times
he
writes
the
satyagrahi
is
ready
to
trust
him
the
time
for
an
implicit
trust
in
human
nature
is
the
very
essence
of
the
creed
mahatmaji
you
are
an
exceptional
man
you
must
not
expect
the
world
to
act
as
you
do
a
critic
once
made
this
observation
it
is
curious
how
we
delude
ourselves
fancying
that
the
body
can
be
improved
but
that
it
is
impossible
to
evoke
the
hidden
powers
of
the
soul
gandhi
replied
i
am
engaged
in
trying
to
show
that
if
i
have
any
of
those
powers
i
am
as
frail
a
mortal
as
any
of
us
and
that
i
never
had
anything
extraordinary
about
me
nor
have
i
now
i
am
a
simple
individual
liable
to
err
like
any
other
fellow
mortal
i
own
however
that
i
have
enough
humility
to
confess
my
errors
and
to
retrace
my
steps
i
own
that
i
have
an
immovable
faith
in
god
and
his
goodness
and
an
unconsumable
passion
for
truth
and
love
but
is
that
not
what
every
person
has
latent
in
him
if
we
are
to
make
progress
we
must
not
repeat
history
but
make
new
history
we
must
add
to
the
inheritance
left
by
our
ancestors
if
we
may
make
new
discoveries
and
inventions
in
the
phenomenal
world
must
we
declare
our
bankruptcy
in
the
spiritual
domain
is
it
impossible
to
multiply
the
exceptions
so
as
to
make
them
the
rule
must
man
always
be
brute
first
and
man
after
if
at
all
americans
may
well
remember
with
pride
the
successful
nonviolent
experiment
of
william
penn
in
founding
his
century
colony
in
pennsylvania
there
were
no
forts
no
soldiers
no
militia
even
no
arms
amidst
the
savage
frontier
wars
and
the
butcheries
that
went
on
between
the
new
settlers
and
the
red
indians
the
quakers
of
pennsylvania
alone
remained
unmolested
others
were
slain
others
were
massacred
but
they
were
safe
not
a
quaker
woman
suffered
assault
not
a
quaker
child
was
slain
not
a
quaker
man
was
tortured
when
the
quakers
were
finally
forced
to
give
up
the
government
of
the
state
war
broke
out
and
some
pennsylvanians
were

gandhi
has
declared
if
the
indian
movement
is
carried
to
success
on
a
nonviolent
satyagraha
basis
it
will
give
a
new
meaning
to
patriotism
and
if
i
may
say
so
in
all
humility
to
life
itself
before
the
west
dismisses
gandhi
program
as
one
of
an
impractical
dreamer
let
it
first
reflect
on
a
definition
of
satyagraha
by
the
master
of
galilee
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
but
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
resist
not
evil
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also
gandhi
epoch
has
extended
with
the
beautiful
precision
of
cosmic
timing
into
a
century

desolated
and
devastated

wars

many
autobiographies
replete
with
famous

are
almost
completely
silent
on
any
phase
of
inner
analysis
or
development
one
lays
down
each
of
these
books
with
a
certain
dissatisfaction
as
though
saying
here
is
a
man
who
knew
many
notable
persons
but
who
never
knew
himself
this
reaction
is
impossible
with
gandhi
autobiography
he
exposes
his
faults
and
subterfuges
with
an
impersonal
devotion
to
truth
rare
in

the

scripture
given
to
persia
about
by
zoroaster
the
unique
feature
of
hinduism
among
the
world
religions
is
that
it
derives
not
from
a
single
great
founder
but
from
the
impersonal
vedic
scriptures
hinduism
thus
gives
scope
for
worshipful
incorporation
into
its
fold
of
prophets
of
all
ages
and
all
lands
the
vedic
scriptures
regulate
not
only
devotional
practices
but
all
important
social
customs
in
an
effort
to
bring
man
every
action
into
harmony

charles
steinmetz
the
great
electrical
engineer
was
once
asked
by
roger
babson
what
line
of
research
will
see
the
greatest
development
during
the
next
fifty
years
i
think
the
greatest
discovery
will
be
made
along
spiritual
lines
steinmetz
replied
here
is
a
force
which
history
clearly
teaches
has
been
the
greatest
power
in
the
development
of
men
yet
we
have
merely
been
playing
with
it
and
have
never
seriously
studied
it
as
we
have
the
physical
forces
someday
people
will
learn
that
material
things
do
not
bring
happiness
and
are
of
little
use
in
making
men
and
women
creative
and
powerful
then
the
scientists
of
the
world
will
turn
their
laboratories
over
to
the
study
of
god
and
prayer
and
the
spiritual
forces
which
as
yet
have
hardly
been
scratched
when
this
day
comes
the
world
will
see
more
advancement
in
one
generation

it
has
seen
in
the

i
have

article

in
i
have
met

on

recently
visited
my
own
little
town
of
jamshedpur
at
the
entreaty
of
a
disciple
ananda
moyi
ma
went
to
the
home
of
a
dying
man
she
stood
by
his
bedside
as
her
hand
touched
his
forehead
his
ceased
the
disease
vanished
at
once
to
the
man
glad
astonishment
he
was
well
a
few
days
later
i
heard
that
the
blissful
mother
was
staying
at
the
home
of
a
disciple
in
the
bhowanipur
section
of
calcutta
wright
and
i
set
out
immediately
from
my
father
calcutta
home
as
the
ford
neared
the
bhowanipur
house
my
companion
and
i
observed
an
unusual
street
scene
ananda
moyi
ma
was
standing
in
an
automobile
blessing
a
throng
of
about
one
hundred
disciples
she
was
evidently
on
the
point
of
departure
wright
parked
the
ford
some
distance
away
and
accompanied
me
on
foot
toward
the
quiet
assemblage
the
woman
saint
glanced
in
our
direction
she
alit
from
her
car
and
walked
toward
us
father
you
have
come
with
these
fervent
words
she
put
her
arm
around
my
neck
and
her
head
on
my
shoulder
wright
to
whom
i
had
just
remarked
that
i
did
not
know
the
saint
was
hugely
enjoying
this
extraordinary
demonstration
of
welcome
the
eyes
of
the
one
hundred
chelas
were
also
fixed
with
some
surprise
on
the
affectionate
tableau
i
had
instantly
seen
that
the
saint
was
in
a
high
state
of
samadhi
utterly
oblivious
to
her
outward
garb
as
a
woman
she
knew
herself
as
the
changeless
soul
from
that
plane
she
was
joyously
greeting
another
devotee
of
god
she
led
me
by
the
hand
into
her
automobile
ananda
moyi
ma
i
am
delaying
your
journey
i
protested
father
i
am
meeting
you
for
the
first
time
in
this
life
after
ages
she
said
please
do
not
leave
yet
we
sat
together
in
the
rear
seats
of
the
car
the
blissful
mother
soon
entered
the
immobile
ecstatic
state
her
beautiful
eyes
glanced
heavenward
and
became
stilled
gazing
into
the
inner
elysium
the
disciples
chanted
gently
victory
to
mother
divine
i
had
found
many
men
of
in
india
but
never
before
had
i
met
such
an
exalted
woman
saint
her
gentle
face
was
burnished
with
the
ineffable
joy
that
had
given
her
the
name
of
blissful
mother
long
black
tresses
lay
loosely
behind
her
unveiled
head
a
red
dot
of
sandalwood
paste
on
her
forehead
symbolized
the
spiritual
eye
ever
open
within
her
tiny
face
tiny
hands
tiny
contrast
to
her
spiritual
magnitude
i
put
some
questions
to
a
woman
chela
while
ananda
moyi
ma
remained
entranced
the
blissful
mother
travels
widely
in
india
in
many
parts
she
has
hundreds
of
disciples
the
chela
told
me
her
courageous
efforts
have
brought
about
many
desirable
social
reforms
although
a
brahmin
the
saint
recognizes
no
caste
distinctions
a
group
of
us
always
travel
with
her
looking
after
her
comforts
we
have
to
mother
her
she
takes
no
notice
of
her
body
if
no
one
gave
her
food
she
would
not
eat
or
make
any
inquiries
even
when
meals
are
placed
before
her
she
does
not
touch
them
to
prevent
her
disappearance
from
this
world
we
disciples
feed
her
with
our
own
hands
for
days
together
she
often
stays
in
the
divine
trance
scarcely
breathing
her
eyes
unwinking
one
of
her
chief
disciples
is
her
husband
many
years
ago
soon
after
their
marriage
he
took
the
vow
of
silence
the
chela
pointed
to
a
man
with
long
hair
and
hoary
beard
he
was
standing
quietly
in
the
midst
of
the
gathering
his
hands
folded
in
a
disciple
reverential
attitude
refreshed
by
her
dip
in
the
infinite
ananda
moyi
ma
was
now
focusing
her
consciousness
on
the
material
world
father
please
tell
me
where
you
stay
her
voice
was
clear
and
melodious
at
present
in
calcutta
or
ranchi
but
soon
i
shall
be
returning
to
america
america
yes
an
indian
woman
saint
would
be
sincerely
appreciated
there
by
spiritual
seekers
would
you
like
to
go
if
father
can
take
me
i
will
go
this
reply
caused
her
disciples
to
start
in
alarm
twenty
or
more
of
us
always
travel
with
the
blissful
mother
one
of
them
told
me
firmly
we
could
not
live
without
her
wherever
she
goes
we
must
go
reluctantly
i
abandoned
the
plan
as
possessing
an
impractical
feature
of
spontaneous
enlargement
please
come
at
least
to
ranchi
with
your
disciples
i
said
on
taking
leave
of
the
saint
as
a
divine
child
yourself
you
will
enjoy
the
little
ones
in
my
school
whenever
father
takes
me
i
will
gladly
go
a
short
time
later
the
ranchi
vidyalaya
was
in
gala
array
for
the
saint
promised
visit
the
youngsters
looked
forward
to
any
day
of
lessons
hours
of
music
and
a
feast
for
the
climax
victory
ananda
moyi
ma
ki
jai
this
reiterated
chant
from
scores
of
enthusiastic
little
throats
greeted
the
saint
party
as
it
entered
the
school
gates
showers
of
marigolds
tinkle
of
cymbals
lusty
blowing
of
conch
shells
and
beat
of
the
mridanga
drum
the
blissful
mother
wandered
smilingly
over
the
sunny
vidyalaya
grounds
ever
carrying
within
her
the
portable
paradise
it
is
beautiful
here
ananda
moyi
ma
said
graciously
as
i
led
her
into
the
main
building
she
seated
herself
with
a
childlike
smile
by
my
side
the
closest
of
dear
friends
she
made
one
feel
yet
an
aura
of
remoteness
was
ever
around
paradoxical
isolation
of
omnipresence
please
tell
me
something
of
your
life
father
knows
all
about
it
why
repeat
it
she
evidently
felt
that
the
factual
history
of
one
short
incarnation
was
beneath
notice
i
laughed
gently
repeating
my
question
father
there
is
little
to
tell
she
spread
her
graceful
hands
in
a
deprecatory
gesture
my
consciousness
has
never
associated
itself
with
this
temporary
body
before
i
came
on
this
earth
father
was
the
same
as
a
little
girl
was
the
same
i
grew
into
womanhood
but
still
was
the
same
when
the
family
in
which
i
had
been
born
made
arrangements
to
have
this
body
married
was
the
same
and
when
my
husband
came
to
me
and
murmured
endearing
words
lightly
touching
my
body
he
received
a
violent
shock
as
if
struck
by
lightning
for
even
then
was
the
same
my
husband
knelt
before
me
folded
his
hands
and
implored
my
pardon
he
said
i
have
desecrated
your
bodily
temple
by
touching
it
with
the
thought
of
knowing
that
within
it
dwelt
not
my
wife
but
the
divine
take
this
solemn
vow
i
shall
be
your
disciple
a
celibate
follower
ever
caring
for
you
in
silence
as
a
servant
never
speaking
to
anyone
again
as
long
as
i
live
may
i
thus
atone
for
the
sin
i
have
today
committed
against
you
my
guru
even
when
i
quietly
accepted
this
proposal
of
my
husband
was
the
same
and
father
in
front
of
you
now
am
the
same
ever
afterward
though
the
dance
of
creation
change
around
me
in
the
hall
of
eternity
shall
be
the
same
ananda
moyi
ma
sank
into
a
deep
meditative
state
her
form
was
she
had
fled
to
her
kingdom
the
dark
pools
of
her
eyes
appeared
lifeless
and
glassy
this
expression
is
often
present
when
saints
remove
their
consciousness
from
the
physical
body
which
is
then
hardly
more
than
a
piece
of
soulless
clay
we
sat
together
for
an
hour
in
the
ecstatic
trance
she
returned
to
this
world
with
a
gay
little
laugh
please
ananda
moyi
ma
i
said
come
with
me
to
the
garden
wright
will
take
some
pictures
of
course
father
your
will
is
my
will
her
glorious
eyes
retained
the
unchanging
divine
luster
as
she
posed
for
many
photographs
time
for
the
feast
ananda
moyi
ma
squatted
on
her
a
disciple
at
her
elbow
to
feed
her
like
an
infant
the
saint
obediently
swallowed
the
food
after
the
chela
had
brought
it
to
her
lips
it
was
plain
that
the
blissful
mother
did
not
recognize
any
difference
between
curries
and
sweetmeats
as
dusk
approached
the
saint
left
with
her
party
amidst
a
shower
of
rose
petals
her
hands
raised
in
blessing
on
the
little
lads
their
faces
shone
with
the
affection
she
had
effortlessly
awakened
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
and
with
all
thy
strength
christ
has
proclaimed
this
is
the
first
commandment
casting
aside
every
inferior
attachment
ananda
moyi
ma
offers
her
sole
allegiance
to
the
lord
not
by
the
hairsplitting
distinctions
of
scholars
but
by
the
sure
logic
of
faith
the
childlike
saint
has
solved
the
only
problem
in
human
of
unity
with
god
man
has
forgotten
this
stark
simplicity
now
befogged
by
a
million
issues
refusing
a
monotheistic
love
to
god
the
nations
disguise
their
infidelity
by
punctilious
respect
before
the
outward
shrines
of
charity
these
humanitarian
gestures
are
virtuous
because
for
a
moment
they
divert
man
attention
from
himself
but
they
do
not
free
him
from
his
single
responsibility
in
life
referred
to
by
jesus
as
the
first
commandment
the
uplifting
obligation
to
love
god
is
assumed
with
man
first
breath
of
an
air
freely
bestowed
by
his
only
benefactor
on
one
other
occasion
after
her
ranchi
visit
i
had
opportunity
to
see
ananda
moyi

she
stood
among
her
disciples
some
months
later
on
the
serampore
station
platform
waiting
for
the
train
father
i
am
going
to
the
himalayas
she
told
me
generous
disciples
have
built
me
a
hermitage
in
dehra
dun
as
she
boarded
the
train
i
marveled
to
see
that
whether
amidst
a
crowd
on
a
train
feasting
or
sitting
in
silence
her
eyes
never
looked
away
from
god
within
me
i
still
hear
her
voice
an
echo
of
measureless
sweetness
behold
now
and
always
one
with
the
eternal
am
ever
the
same
i
find
some
further
facts
of
ananda

in

illiterate
she
has
yet
stunned
the
intellectuals
by
her
wisdom
her
verses
in
sanskrit
have
filled
scholars
with
wonderment
she
has
brought
consolation
to
bereaved

effected
miraculous

the
woman
yogi
who
never
eats
sir
whither
are
we
bound
this
morning
wright
was
driving
the
ford
he
took
his
eyes
off
the
road
long
enough
to
gaze
at
me
with
a
questioning
twinkle
from
day
to
day
he
seldom
knew
what
part
of
bengal
he
would
be
discovering
next
god
willing
i
replied
devoutly
we
are
on
our
way
to
see
an
eighth
wonder
of
the
woman
saint
whose
diet
is
thin
air
repetition
of
therese
neumann
but
wright
laughed
eagerly
just
the
same
he
even
accelerated
the
speed
of
the
car
more
extraordinary
grist
for
his
travel
diary
not
one
of
an
average
tourist
that
the
ranchi
school
had
just
been
left
behind
us
we
had
risen
before
the
sun
besides
my
secretary
and
myself
three
bengali
friends
were
in
the
party
we
drank
in
the
exhilarating
air
the
natural
wine
of
the
morning
our
driver
guided
the
car
warily
among
the
early
peasants
and
the
carts
slowly
drawn
by
yoked
bullocks
inclined
to
dispute
the
road
with
a
honking
interloper
sir
we
would
like
to
know
more
of
the
fasting
saint
her
name
is
giri
bala
i
informed
my
companions
i
first
heard
about
her
years
ago
from
a
scholarly
gentleman
sthiti
lal
nundy
he
often
came
to
the
gurpar
road
home
to
tutor
my
brother
bishnu
know
giri
bala
well
sthiti
babu
told
me
employs
a
certain
yoga
technique
which
enables
her
to
live
without
eating
i
was
her
close
neighbor
in
nawabganj
near
ichapur
i
made
it
a
point
to
watch
her
closely
never
did
i
find
evidence
that
she
was
taking
either
food
or
drink
my
interest
finally
mounted
so
high
that
i
approached
the
maharaja
of
burdwan
and
asked
him
to
conduct
an
investigation
astounded
at
the
story
he
invited
her
to
his
palace
she
agreed
to
a
test
and
lived
for
two
months
locked
up
in
a
small
section
of
his
home
later
she
returned
for
a
palace
visit
of
twenty
days
and
then
for
a
third
test
of
fifteen
days
the
maharaja
himself
told
me
that
these
three
rigorous
scrutinies
had
convinced
him
beyond
doubt
of
her
state
this
story
of
sthiti
babu
has
remained
in
my
mind
for
over
years
i
concluded
sometimes
in
america
i
wondered
if
the
river
of
time
would
not
swallow
the
yogini
before
i
could
meet
her
she
must
be
quite
aged
now
i
do
not
even
know
where
or
if
she
lives
but
in
a
few
hours
we
shall
reach
purulia
her
brother
has
a
home
there
by
our
little
group
was
conversing
with
the
brother
lambadar
dey
a
lawyer
of
purulia
yes
my
sister
is
living
she
sometimes
stays
with
me
here
but
at
present
she
is
at
our
family
home
in
biur
lambadar
babu
glanced
doubtfully
at
the
ford
i
hardly
think
swamiji
that
any
automobile
has
ever
penetrated
into
the
interior
as
far
as
biur
it
might
be
best
if
you
all
resign
yourselves
to
the
ancient
jolt
of
the
bullock
cart
as
one
voice
our
party
pledged
loyalty
to
the
pride
of
detroit
the
ford
comes
from
america
i
told
the
lawyer
it
would
be
a
shame
to
deprive
it
of
an
opportunity
to
get
acquainted
with
the
heart
of
bengal
may
ganesh
go
with
you
lambadar
babu
said
laughing
he
added
courteously
if
you
ever
get
there
i
am
sure
giri
bala
will
be
glad
to
see
you
she
is
approaching
her
seventies
but
continues
in
excellent
health
please
tell
me
sir
if
it
is
absolutely
true
that
she
eats
nothing
i
looked
directly
into
his
eyes
those
telltale
windows
of
the
mind
illustration
giri
bala
this
great
woman
yogi
has
not
taken
food
or
drink
since
i
am
pictured
with
her
in
at
her
home
in
the
isolated
bengal
village
of
biur
her
state
has
been
rigorously
investigated
by
the
maharaja
of
burdwan
she
employs
a
certain
yoga
technique
to
recharge
her
body
with
cosmic
energy
from
the
ether
sun
and
see
it
is
true
his
gaze
was
open
and
honorable
in
more
than
five
decades
i
have
never
seen
her
eat
a
morsel
if
the
world
suddenly
came
to
an
end
i
could
not
be
more
astonished
than
by
the
sight
of
my
sister
taking
food
we
chuckled
together
over
the
improbability
of
these
two
cosmic
events
giri
bala
has
never
sought
an
inaccessible
solitude
for
her
yoga
practices
lambadar
babu
went
on
she
has
lived
her
entire
life
surrounded
by
her
family
and
friends
they
are
all
well
accustomed
now
to
her
strange
state
not
one
of
them
who
would
not
be
stupefied
if
giri
bala
suddenly
decided
to
eat
anything
sister
is
naturally
retiring
as
befits
a
hindu
widow
but
our
little
circle
in
purulia
and
in
biur
all
know
that
she
is
literally
an
woman
the
brother
sincerity
was
manifest
our
little
party
thanked
him
warmly
and
set
out
toward
biur
we
stopped
at
a
street
shop
for
curry
and
luchis
attracting
a
swarm
of
urchins
who
gathered
round
to
watch
wright
eating
with
his
fingers
in
the
simple
hindu
manner
hearty
appetites
caused
us
to
fortify
ourselves
against
an
afternoon
which
unknown
at
the
moment
was
to
prove
fairly
laborious
our
way
now
led
east
through
rice
fields
into
the
burdwan
section
of
bengal
on
through
roads
lined
with
dense
vegetation
the
songs
of
the
maynas
and
the
bulbuls
streamed
out
from
trees
with
huge
umbrellalike
branches
a
bullock
cart
now
and
then
the
rini
rini
manju
manju
squeak
of
its
axle
and
wooden
wheels
contrasting
sharply
in
mind
with
the
swish
swish
of
auto
tires
over
the
aristocratic
asphalt
of
the
cities
dick
halt
my
sudden
request
brought
a
jolting
protest
from
the
ford
that
overburdened
mango
tree
is
fairly
shouting
an
invitation
the
five
of
us
dashed
like
children
to
the
earth
the
tree
had
benevolently
shed
its
fruits
as
they
had
ripened
full
many
a
mango
is
born
to
lie
unseen
i
paraphrased
and
waste
its
sweetness
on
the
stony
ground
nothing
like
this
in
america
swamiji
eh
laughed
sailesh
mazumdar
one
of
my
bengali
students
no
i
admitted
covered
with
mango
juice
and
contentment
how
i
have
missed
this
fruit
in
the
west
a
hindu
heaven
without
mangoes
is
inconceivable
i
picked
up
a
rock
and
downed
a
proud
beauty
hidden
on
the
highest
limb
dick
i
asked
between
bites
of
ambrosia
warm
with
the
tropical
sun
are
all
the
cameras
in
the
car
yes
sir
in
the
baggage
compartment
if
giri
bala
proves
to
be
a
true
saint
i
want
to
write
about
her
in
the
west
a
hindu
yogini
with
such
inspiring
powers
should
not
live
and
die
most
of
these
mangoes
half
an
hour
later
i
was
still
strolling
in
the
sylvan
peace
sir
wright
remarked
we
should
reach
giri
bala
before
the
sun
sets
to
have
enough
light
for
photographs
he
added
with
a
grin
the
westerners
are
a
skeptical
lot
we
ca
expect
them
to
believe
in
the
lady
without
any
pictures
this
bit
of
wisdom
was
indisputable
i
turned
my
back
on
temptation
and
reentered
the
car
you
are
right
dick
i
sighed
as
we
sped
along
i
sacrifice
the
mango
paradise
on
the
altar
of
western
realism
photographs
we
must
have
the
road
became
more
and
more
sickly
wrinkles
of
ruts
boils
of
hardened
clay
the
sad
infirmities
of
old
age
our
group
dismounted
occasionally
to
allow
wright
to
more
easily
maneuver
the
ford
which
the
four
of
us
pushed
from
behind
lambadar
babu
spoke
truly
sailesh
acknowledged
the
car
is
not
carrying
us
we
are
carrying
the
car
our
auto
tedium
was
beguiled
ever
and
anon
by
the
appearance
of
a
village
each
one
a
scene
of
quaint
simplicity
our
way
twisted
and
turned
through
groves
of
palms
among
ancient
unspoiled
villages
nestling
in
the
forest
shade
wright
has
recorded
in
his
travel
diary
under
date
of
may
very
fascinating
are
these
clusters
of
thatched
mud
huts
decorated
with
one
of
the
names
of
god
on
the
door
many
small
naked
children
innocently
playing
about
pausing
to
stare
or
run
wildly
from
this
big
black
bullockless
carriage
tearing
madly
through
their
village
the
women
merely
peep
from
the
shadows
while
the
men
lazily
loll
beneath
the
trees
along
the
roadside
curious
beneath
their
nonchalance
in
one
place
all
the
villagers
were
gaily
bathing
in
the
large
tank
in
their
garments
changing
by
draping
dry
cloths
around
their
bodies
dropping
the
wet
ones
women
bearing
water
to
their
homes
in
huge
brass
jars
the
road
led
us
a
merry
chase
over
mount
and
ridge
we
bounced
and
tossed
dipped
into
small
streams
detoured
around
an
unfinished
causeway
slithered
across
dry
sandy
river
beds
and
finally
about
we
were
close
to
our
destination
biur
this
minute
village
in
the
interior
of
bankura
district
hidden
in
the
protection
of
dense
foliage
is
unapproachable
by
travelers
during
the
rainy
season
when
the
streams
are
raging
torrents
and
the
roads
serpentlike
spit
the
asking
for
a
guide
among
a
group
of
worshipers
on
their
way
home
from
a
temple
prayer
out
in
the
lonely
field
we
were
besieged
by
a
dozen
scantily
clad
lads
who
clambered
on
the
sides
of
the
car
eager
to
conduct
us
to
giri
bala
the
road
led
toward
a
grove
of
date
palms
sheltering
a
group
of
mud
huts
but
before
we
had
reached
it
the
ford
was
momentarily
tipped
at
a
dangerous
angle
tossed
up
and
dropped
down
the
narrow
trail
led
around
trees
and
tank
over
ridges
into
holes
and
deep
ruts
the
car
became
anchored
on
a
clump
of
bushes
then
grounded
on
a
hillock
requiring
a
lift
of
earth
clods
on
we
proceeded
slowly
and
carefully
suddenly
the
way
was
stopped
by
a
mass
of
brush
in
the
middle
of
the
cart
track
necessitating
a
detour
down
a
precipitous
ledge
into
a
dry
tank
rescue
from
which
demanded
some
scraping
adzing
and
shoveling
again
and
again
the
road
seemed
impassable
but
the
pilgrimage
must
go
on
obliging
lads
fetched
spades
and
demolished
the
obstacles
shades
of
ganesh
while
hundreds
of
children
and
parents
stared
soon
we
were
threading
our
way
along
the
two
ruts
of
antiquity
women
gazing
from
their
hut
doors
men
trailing
alongside
and
behind
us
children
scampering
to
swell
the
procession
ours
was
perhaps
the
first
auto
to
traverse
these
roads
the
cart
union
must
be
omnipotent
here
what
a
sensation
we
group
piloted
by
an
american
and
pioneering
in
a
snorting
car
right
into
their
hamlet
fastness
invading
the
ancient
privacy
and
sanctity
halting
by
a
narrow
lane
we
found
ourselves
within
a
hundred
feet
of
giri
bala
ancestral
home
we
felt
the
thrill
of
fulfillment
after
the
long
road
struggle
crowned
by
a
rough
finish
we
approached
a
large
building
of
brick
and
plaster
dominating
the
surrounding
adobe
huts
the
house
was
under
the
process
of
repair
for
around
it
was
the
characteristically
tropical
framework
of
bamboos
with
feverish
anticipation
and
suppressed
rejoicing
we
stood
before
the
open
doors
of
the
one
blessed
by
the
lord
touch
constantly
agape
were
the
villagers
young
and
old
bare
and
dressed
women
aloof
somewhat
but
inquisitive
too
men
and
boys
unabashedly
at
our
heels
as
they
gazed
on
this
unprecedented
spectacle
soon
a
short
figure
came
into
view
in
the
bala
she
was
swathed
in
a
cloth
of
dull
goldish
silk
in
typically
indian
fashion
she
drew
forward
modestly
and
hesitatingly
peering
slightly
from
beneath
the
upper
fold
of
her
swadeshi
cloth
her
eyes
glistened
like
smouldering
embers
in
the
shadow
of
her
head
piece
we
were
enamored
by
a
most
benevolent
and
kindly
face
a
face
of
realization
and
understanding
free
from
the
taint
of
earthly
attachment
meekly
she
approached
and
silently
assented
to
our
snapping
a
number
of
pictures
with
our
and
cameras
patiently
and
shyly
she
endured
our
photo
techniques
of
posture
adjustment
and
light
arrangement
finally
we
had
recorded
for
posterity
many
photographs
of
the
only
woman
in
the
world
who
is
known
to
have
lived
without
food
or
drink
for
over
fifty
years
therese
neumann
of
course
has
fasted
since
most
motherly
was
giri
bala
expression
as
she
stood
before
us
completely
covered
in
the
cloth
nothing
of
her
body
visible
but
her
face
with
its
downcast
eyes
her
hands
and
her
tiny
feet
a
face
of
rare
peace
and
innocent
wide
childlike
quivering
lip
a
feminine
nose
narrow
sparkling
eyes
and
a
wistful
smile
wright
impression
of
giri
bala
was
shared
by
myself
spirituality
enfolded
her
like
her
gently
shining
veil
she
pronamed
before
me
in
the
customary
gesture
of
greeting
from
a
householder
to
a
monk
her
simple
charm
and
quiet
smile
gave
us
a
welcome
beyond
that
of
honeyed
oratory
forgotten
was
our
difficult
dusty
trip
the
little
saint
seated
herself
on
the
verandah
though
bearing
the
scars
of
age
she
was
not
emaciated
her
skin
had
remained
clear
and
healthy
in
tone
mother
i
said
in
bengali
for
over
years
i
have
thought
eagerly
of
this
very
pilgrimage
i
heard
about
your
sacred
life
from
sthiti
lal
nundy
babu
she
nodded
in
acknowledgment
yes
my
good
neighbor
in
nawabganj
during
those
years
i
have
crossed
the
oceans
but
i
never
forgot
my
early
plan
to
someday
see
you
the
sublime
drama
that
you
are
here
playing
so
inconspicuously
should
be
blazoned
before
a
world
that
has
long
forgotten
the
inner
food
divine
the
saint
lifted
her
eyes
for
a
minute
smiling
with
serene
interest
baba
honored
father
knows
best
she
answered
meekly
i
was
happy
that
she
had
taken
no
offense
one
never
knows
how
great
yogis
or
yoginis
will
react
to
the
thought
of
publicity
they
shun
it
as
a
rule
wishing
to
pursue
in
silence
the
profound
soul
research
an
inner
sanction
comes
to
them
when
the
proper
time
arrives
to
display
their
lives
openly
for
the
benefit
of
seeking
minds
mother
i
went
on
please
forgive
me
then
for
burdening
you
with
many
questions
kindly
answer
only
those
that
please
you
i
shall
understand
your
silence
also
she
spread
her
hands
in
a
gracious
gesture
i
am
glad
to
reply
insofar
as
an
insignificant
person
like
myself
can
give
satisfactory
answers
oh
no
not
insignificant
i
protested
sincerely
you
are
a
great
soul
i
am
the
humble
servant
of
all
she
added
quaintly
i
love
to
cook
and
feed
people
a
strange
pastime
i
thought
for
a
saint
tell
me
mother
from
your
own
you
live
without
food
that
is
true
she
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
her
next
remark
showed
that
she
had
been
struggling
with
mental
arithmetic
from
the
age
of
twelve
years
four
months
down
to
my
present
age
of
a
period
of
over
years
i
have
not
eaten
food
or
taken
liquids
are
you
never
tempted
to
eat
if
i
felt
a
craving
for
food
i
would
have
to
eat
simply
yet
regally
she
stated
this
axiomatic
truth
one
known
too
well
by
a
world
revolving
around
three
meals
a
day
but
you
do
eat
something
my
tone
held
a
note
of
remonstrance
of
course
she
smiled
in
swift
understanding
your
nourishment
derives
from
the
finer
energies
of
the
air
and
sunlight
and
from
the
cosmic
power
which
recharges
your
body
through
the
medulla
oblongata
baba
knows
again
she
acquiesced
her
manner
soothing
and
unemphatic
mother
please
tell
me
about
your
early
life
it
holds
a
deep
interest
for
all
of
india
and
even
for
our
brothers
and
sisters
beyond
the
seas
giri
bala
put
aside
her
habitual
reserve
relaxing
into
a
conversational
mood
so
be
it
her
voice
was
low
and
firm
i
was
born
in
these
forest
regions
my
childhood
was
unremarkable
save
that
i
was
possessed
by
an
insatiable
appetite
i
had
been
betrothed
in
early
years
my
mother
often
warned
me
to
control
your
greed
when
the
time
comes
for
you
to
live
among
strangers
in
your
family
what
will
they
think
of
you
if
your
days
are
spent
in
nothing
but
eating
the
calamity
she
had
foreseen
came
to
pass
i
was
only
twelve
when
i
joined
my
husband
people
in
nawabganj
my
shamed
me
morning
noon
and
night
about
my
gluttonous
habits
her
scoldings
were
a
blessing
in
disguise
however
they
roused
my
dormant
spiritual
tendencies
one
morning
her
ridicule
was
merciless
shall
soon
prove
to
you
i
said
stung
to
the
quick
i
shall
never
touch
food
again
as
long
as
i
live
my
laughed
in
derision
she
said
can
you
live
without
eating
when
you
can
not
live
without
overeating
this
remark
was
unanswerable
yet
an
iron
resolution
scaffolded
my
spirit
in
a
secluded
spot
i
sought
my
heavenly
father
i
prayed
incessantly
send
me
a
guru
one
who
can
teach
me
to
live
by
thy
light
and
not
by
food
a
divine
ecstasy
fell
over
me
led
by
a
beatific
spell
i
set
out
for
the
nawabganj
ghat
on
the
ganges
on
the
way
i
encountered
the
priest
of
my
husband
family
sir
i
said
trustingly
tell
me
how
to
live
without
eating
he
stared
at
me
without
reply
finally
he
spoke
in
a
consoling
manner
he
said
to
the
temple
this
evening
i
will
conduct
a
special
vedic
ceremony
for
you
this
vague
answer
was
not
the
one
i
was
seeking
i
continued
toward
the
ghat
the
morning
sun
pierced
the
waters
i
purified
myself
in
the
ganges
as
though
for
a
sacred
initiation
as
i
left
the
river
bank
my
wet
cloth
around
me
in
the
broad
glare
of
day
my
master
materialized
himself
before
me
little
one
he
said
in
a
voice
of
loving
compassion
am
the
guru
sent
here
by
god
to
fulfill
your
urgent
prayer
he
was
deeply
touched
by
its
very
unusual
nature
from
today
you
shall
live
by
the
astral
light
your
bodily
atoms
fed
from
the
infinite
current
giri
bala
fell
into
silence
i
took
wright
pencil
and
pad
and
translated
into
english
a
few
items
for
his
information
the
saint
resumed
the
tale
her
gentle
voice
barely
audible
the
ghat
was
deserted
but
my
guru
cast
round
us
an
aura
of
guarding
light
that
no
stray
bathers
later
disturb
us
he
initiated
me
into
a
kria
technique
which
frees
the
body
from
dependence
on
the
gross
food
of
mortals
the
technique
includes
the
use
of
a
certain
mantra
and
a
breathing
exercise
more
difficult
than
the
average
person
could
perform
no
medicine
or
magic
is
involved
nothing
beyond
the
kria
in
the
manner
of
the
american
newspaper
reporter
who
had
unknowingly
taught
me
his
procedure
i
questioned
giri
bala
on
many
matters
which
i
thought
would
be
of
interest
to
the
world
she
gave
me
bit
by
bit
the
following
information
i
have
never
had
any
children
many
years
ago
i
became
a
widow
i
sleep
very
little
as
sleep
and
waking
are
the
same
to
me
i
meditate
at
night
attending
to
my
domestic
duties
in
the
daytime
i
slightly
feel
the
change
in
climate
from
season
to
season
i
have
never
been
sick
or
experienced
any
disease
i
feel
only
slight
pain
when
accidentally
injured
i
have
no
bodily
excretions
i
can
control
my
heart
and
breathing
i
often
see
my
guru
as
well
as
other
great
souls
in
vision
mother
i
asked
why
do
you
teach
others
the
method
of
living
without
food
my
ambitious
hopes
for
the
world
starving
millions
were
nipped
in
the
bud
no
she
shook
her
head
i
was
strictly
commanded
by
my
guru
not
to
divulge
the
secret
it
is
not
his
wish
to
tamper
with
drama
of
creation
the
farmers
would
not
thank
me
if
i
taught
many
people
to
live
without
eating
the
luscious
fruits
would
lie
uselessly
on
the
ground
it
appears
that
misery
starvation
and
disease
are
whips
of
our
karma
which
ultimately
drive
us
to
seek
the
true
meaning
of
life
mother
i
said
slowly
what
is
the
use
of
your
having
been
singled
out
to
live
without
eating
to
prove
that
man
is
spirit
her
face
lit
with
wisdom
to
demonstrate
that
by
divine
advancement
he
can
gradually
learn
to
live
by
the
eternal
light
and
not
by
food
the
saint
sank
into
a
deep
meditative
state
her
gaze
was
directed
inward
the
gentle
depths
of
her
eyes
became
expressionless
she
gave
a
certain
sigh
the
prelude
to
the
ecstatic
breathless
trance
for
a
time
she
had
fled
to
the
questionless
realm
the
heaven
of
inner
joy
the
tropical
darkness
had
fallen
the
light
of
a
small
kerosene
lamp
flickered
fitfully
over
the
faces
of
a
score
of
villagers
squatting
silently
in
the
shadows
the
darting
glowworms
and
distant
oil
lanterns
of
the
huts
wove
bright
eerie
patterns
into
the
velvet
night
it
was
the
painful
hour
of
parting
a
slow
tedious
journey
lay
before
our
little
party
giri
bala
i
said
as
the
saint
opened
her
eyes
please
give
me
a
strip
of
one
of
your
saris
she
soon
returned
with
a
piece
of
benares
silk
extending
it
in
her
hand
as
she
suddenly
prostrated
herself
on
the
ground
mother
i
said
reverently
rather
let
me
touch
your
own
blessed
feet
in
northern
bengal
sir
bijay
chand
mahtab
now
dead
his
family
doubtless
possesses
some
record
of
the
maharaja
three
investigations
of
giri
bala

yogi
remover
of

the
god
of
good
fortune
sri
yukteswar
used
to
say
the
lord
has
given
us
the
fruits
of
the
good
earth
we
like
to
see
our
food
to
smell
it
to
taste
it
the
hindu
likes
also
to
touch
it
one
does
not
mind
hearing
it
either
if
no
one
else
is
present
at
the
meal
wright
also
took
moving
pictures
of
sri
yukteswar
during
his
last
winter
solstice
festival
in
serampore
what
we
eat
is
radiation
our
food
is
so
much
quanta
of
energy
george
crile
of
cleveland
told
a
gathering
of
medical
men
on
may
in
memphis
this
radiation
which
releases
electrical
currents
for
the
body
electrical
circuit
the
nervous
system
is
given
to
food
by
the
sun
rays
atoms
crile
says
are
solar
systems
atoms
are
the
vehicles
that
are
filled
with
solar
radiance
as
so
many
coiled
springs
these
countless
atomfuls
of
energy
are
taken
in
as
food
once
in
the
human
body
these
tense
vehicles
the
atoms
are
discharged
in
the
protoplasm
the
radiance
furnishing
new
chemical
energy
new
electrical
currents
body
is
made
up
of
such
atoms
crile
said
are
your
muscles
brains
and
sensory
organs
such
as
the
eyes
and
ears
someday
scientists
will
discover
how
man
can
live
directly
on
solar
energy
chlorophyll
is
the
only
substance
known
in
nature
that
somehow
possesses
the
power
to
act
as
a
trap
william
laurence
writes
in
the
new
york
times
it
the
energy
of
sunlight
and
stores
it
in
the
plant
without
this
no
life
could
exist
we
obtain
the
energy
we
need
for
living
from
the
solar
energy
stored
in
the
we
eat
or
in
the
flesh
of
the
animals
that
eat
the
plants
the
energy
we
obtain
from
coal
or
oil
is
solar
energy
trapped
by
the
chlorophyll
in
plant
life
millions
of
years
ago
we
live
by
the
sun
through
the
agency
of
chlorophyll
potent
vibratory
chant
the
literal
translation
of
sanskrit
mantra
is
instrument
of
thought
signifying
the
ideal
inaudible
sounds
which
represent
one
aspect
of
creation
when
vocalized
as
syllables
a
mantra
constitutes
a
universal
terminology
the
infinite
powers
of
sound
derive
from
aum
the
word
or
creative
hum
of

chapter
i
return
to
the
west
i
have
given
many
yoga
lessons
in
india
and
america
but
i
must
confess
that
as
a
hindu
i
am
unusually
happy
to
be
conducting
a
class
for
english
students
my
london

members
laughed
appreciatively

a
meeting
on

at
whitefield
congregational
church
where
i
addressed
the
audience
on
the
weighty
subject
of
how
faith
in
fellowship
may
save
civilization
the
eight
lectures
at
caxton
hall
attracted
such
crowds
that
on
two
nights
the
overflow
waited
in
windsor
house
auditorium
for
my
second
talk
at
yoga
classes
during
the
following
weeks

so
large
that
wright

arrange

admirable
expression

to

to
my

before

mr
dickinson
the
next
parcel
contained
a
gift
which
i
had
bought
in
a
calcutta
bazaar
dickinson
will
like
this
i
had
thought
at
the
time
a
dearly
beloved
disciple
dickinson
had
been
present
at
every
christmas
festivity
since
the
founding
of
mt
washington
at
this
eleventh
annual
celebration
he
was
standing
before
me
untying
the
ribbons
of
his
square
little
package
the
silver
cup
struggling
with
emotion
he
stared
at
the
present
a
tall
drinking
cup
he
seated
himself
some
distance
away
apparently
in
a
daze
i
smiled
at
him
affectionately
before
resuming
my
role
as
santa
claus
the
ejaculatory
evening
closed
with
a
prayer
to
the
giver
of
all
gifts
then
a
group
singing
of
christmas
carols
dickinson
and
i
were
chatting
together
sometime
later
sir
he
said
please
let
me
thank
you
now
for
the
silver
cup
i
could
not
find
any
words
on
christmas
night
i
brought
the
gift
especially
for
you
for
years
i
have
been
waiting
for
that
silver
cup
it
is
a
long
story
one
i
have
kept
hidden
within
me
dickinson
looked
at
me
shyly
the
beginning
was
dramatic
i
was
drowning
my
older
brother
had
playfully
pushed
me
into
a
pool
in
a
small
town
in
nebraska
i
was
only
five
years
old
then
as
i
was
about
to
sink
for
the
second
time
under
the
water
a
dazzling
multicolored
light
appeared
filling
all
space
in
the
midst
was
the
figure
of
a
man
with
tranquil
eyes
and
a
reassuring
smile
my
body
was
sinking
for
the
third
time
when
one
of
my
companions
bent
a
tall
slender
willow
tree
in
such
a
low
dip
that
i
could
grasp
it
with
my
desperate
fingers
the
boys
lifted
me
to
the
bank
and
successfully
gave
me
treatment
twelve
years
later
a
youth
of
seventeen
i
visited
chicago
with
my
mother
it
was
the
great
world
parliament
of
religions
was
in
session
mother
and
i
were
walking
down
a
main
street
when
again
i
saw
the
mighty
flash
of
light
a
few
paces
away
strolling
leisurely
along
was
the
same
man
i
had
seen
years
before
in
vision
he
approached
a
large
auditorium
and
vanished
within
the
door

she
and
i
hastened
into
the
building
the
man
was
seated
on
a
lecture
platform
we
soon
learned
that
he
was
swami
vivekananda
of
india
after
he
had
given
a
talk
i
went
forward
to
meet
him
he
smiled
on
me
graciously
as
though
we
were
old
friends
i
was
so
young
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
give
expression
to
my
feelings
but
in
my
heart
i
was
hoping
that
he
would
offer
to
be
my
teacher
he
read
my
thought
my
son
i
am
not
your
guru
vivekananda
gazed
with
his
beautiful
piercing
eyes
deep
into
my
own
teacher
will
come
later
he
will
give
you
a
silver
cup
after
a
little
pause
he
added
smiling
will
pour
out
to
you
more
blessings
than
you
are
now
able
to
hold
i
left
chicago
in
a
few
days
dickinson
went
on
and
never
saw
the
great
vivekananda
again
but
every
word
he
had
uttered
was
indelibly
written
on
my
inmost
consciousness
years
passed
no
teacher
appeared
one
night
in
i
prayed
deeply
that
the
lord
would
send
me
my
guru
a
few
hours
later
i
was
awakened
from
sleep
by
soft
strains
of
melody
a
band
of
celestial
beings
carrying
flutes
and
other
instruments
came
before
my
view
after
filling
the
air
with
glorious
music
the
angels
slowly
vanished
the
next
evening
i
attended
for
the
first
time
one
of
your
lectures
here
in
los
angeles
and
knew
then
that
my
prayer
had
been
granted
we
smiled
at
each
other
in
silence
for
eleven
years
now
i
have
been
your
kriya
yoga
disciple
dickinson
continued
sometimes
i
wondered
about
the
silver
cup
i
had
almost
persuaded
myself
that
vivekananda
words
were
only
metaphorical
but
on
christmas
night
as
you
handed
me
the
square
box
by
the
tree
i
saw
for
the
third
time
in
my
life
the
same
dazzling
flash
of
light
in
another
minute
i
was
gazing
on
my
guru
gift
which
vivekananda
had
foreseen
for
me
years

sister
gyanamata
smilingly
led
me
through
a
gate
and
up
a
walk
i
saw
a
building
jutting
out
like
a
great
white
ocean
liner
toward
the
blue
brine
first
speechlessly
then
with
oh
and
ah
finally
with
man
insufficient
vocabulary
of
joy
and
gratitude
i
examined
the
unusually
large

charmingly
appointed

stately
central

dream
ever
more

the
good
and
heroic
and
bountiful

of
the

come
here

a
prayer
for
a

the

may
they
go
hand
in

with
us
giving
the
healing
virtues
of
their
blessed
gifts

widespread

triumph
here

over

over
deceit

over
contempt
that
our
minds
be
delighted
and
our
souls
uplifted
let
our
bodies
be
glorified
as
well
and

thee

had
combed

in

of
a

for
a
preface
to

i
recounted
my
first
outstanding
experience
with
the
receptivity
of
westerners
to
the
quaintly
devotional
airs
of
the
east
the
occasion
had
been
a
public
lecture
the
time
april
the
place
carnegie
hall
in
new
york
hunsicker
i
had
confided
to
an
american
student
i
am
planning
to
ask
the
audience
to
sing
an
ancient
hindu
chant
god
beautiful
sir
hunsicker
had
protested
these
oriental
songs
are
alien
to
american
understanding
what
a
shame
if
the
lecture
were
to
be
marred
by
a
commentary
of
overripe
tomatoes
i
had
laughingly
disagreed
music
is
a
universal
language
americans
will
not
fail
to
feel
the
in
this
lofty
chant
during
the
lecture
hunsicker
had
sat
behind
me
on
the
platform
probably
fearing
for
my
safety
his
doubts
were
groundless
not
only
had
there
been
an
absence
of
unwelcome
vegetables
but
for
one
hour
and
minutes
the
strains
of
o
god
beautiful
had
sounded
uninterruptedly
from
three
thousand
throats
blase
no
longer
dear
new
yorkers
your
hearts
had
soared
out
in
a
simple
paean
of
rejoicing
divine
healings
had
taken
place
that
evening
among
the
devotees
chanting
with
love
the
lord
blessed
name
the
secluded
life
of
a
literary
minstrel
was
not
my
role
for
long
soon
i
was
dividing
every
fortnight
between
los

and
encinitas
sunday
services

had
summoned
him
in
to

i
told
him
during
a
visit
to
his
new
temple
this

headquarters
is
a
memorial
in
stone
to
your
tireless
devotion
here
in

you
have
held
aloft

premananda
accompanied
me
from
washington
for
a
brief
visit
to
the
fellowship
center
in
boston
what
joy
to
see
again
the
kriya
yoga
band
who
had
remained
steadfast
since
the
boston
leader
lewis
lodged
my
companion
and
myself
in
a
modern
artistically
decorated
suite
sir
lewis
said
to
me
smiling
during
your
early
years
in
america
you
stayed
in
this
city
in
a
single
room
without
bath
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
boston
possesses
some
luxurious
apartments
the
shadows
of
approaching
carnage
were
lengthening
over
the
world
already
the
acute
ear
might
hear
the
frightful
drums
of
war
during
interviews
with
thousands
in
california
and
through
a
correspondence
i
found
that
men
and
women
were
deeply
searching
their
hearts
the
tragic
outer
insecurity
had
emphasized
need
for
the
eternal
anchorage
we
have
indeed
learned
the
value
of
meditation
the
leader
of
the
london
fellowship
center
wrote
me
in
and
know
that
nothing
can
disturb
our
inner
peace
in
the
last
few
weeks
during
the
meetings
we
have
heard
warnings
and
listened
to
the
explosion
of
bombs
but
our
students
still
gather
and
thoroughly
enjoy
our
beautiful
service

letter
reached
me
from

nobly
pathetic
words

different

to
me
from
los

sailing
into
port
as
a
vessel
laden
with
the
blessings
and
comfort
of
the
holy
grail
to
a
beleaguered
city
i
see
as
in
a
dream
your
palm
tree
grove
and
the
temple
at
encinitas
with
its
ocean
stretches
and
mountain
views
and
above
all
its
fellowship
of
spiritually
minded
men
and
women
a
community
comprehended
in
unity
absorbed
in
creative
work
and
replenished
in
contemplation
it
is
the
world
of
my
own
vision
in
the
making
of
which
i
hoped
to
bear
my
little
part
and
now
perhaps
in
the
body
i
shall
never
reach
your
golden
shores
nor
worship
in
your
temple
but
it
is
something
and
more
to
have
had
the
vision
and
know
that
in
the
midst
of
war
there
is
still
a
peace
that
abides
in
your
harbors
and
among
your
hills

at

truly
paramhansaji
has
it
been
worth
it
he
gazed
at

with
an
earnest
sincerity
i
understood
his
laconic
question
have
you
been
happy
in
america
what
about
the
disillusionments
the
heartaches
the
center
leaders
who
could
not
lead
the
students
who
could
not
be
taught

is
the
man
whom
the
lord
doth
test
doctor
he
has
remembered
now
and
then
to
put
a
burden
on
me
i
thought
then
of
all
the
faithful
ones
of
the
love
and
devotion
and
understanding
that
lay
in
the
heart
of
america
with
slow
emphasis
i
went
on
but
my
answer
is
yes
a
thousand
times
yes
it
has
been
it
has
been
a
constant
inspiration
more
than
ever
i
dreamed
to
see
west

east
brought
closer
in
the
only
lasting
bond
the
spiritual
silently
i
added
a
prayer
may
babaji
and
sri
yukteswarji
feel
that
i
have
done
my
part
not
disappointing
the
high
hope
in
which
they
sent
me
forth
i
turned
again
to
the
organ
this
time
my
song
was
tinged
with
a
martial
valor
the
grinding
wheel
of
time
doth
mar
full
many
a
life
of
moon
and
star
and
many
a
brightly
smiling
morn
but
still
my
soul
is
marching
on
darkness
death
and
failures
vied
to
block
my
path
they
fiercely
tried
my
fight
with
jealous
nature

but
still
my

marching
on

from

we
were
strolling
in

my

pointed
to

i
have
started
a

colony
brotherhood

an
ideal
better
understood
by
example
than

a
small
harmonious
group
here
may
inspire
other
ideal
communities
over
the
earth
a
splendid
idea
sir
the
colony
will
surely
be
a
success
if
everyone
sincerely
does
his
part
is
a
large
term
but
man
must
enlarge
his
allegiance
considering
himself
in
the
light
of
a
world
citizen

truly
feels

my
venerable
father
seated
in
the
tranquil
lotus
posture
calcutta
see
far
into
the
night
my
dear
first
kriya
yogi
in
america
discussed
with
me
the
need
for
world
colonies
founded
on
a
spiritual
basis
the
ills
attributed
to
an
anthropomorphic
abstraction
called
society
may
be
laid
more
realistically
at
the
door
of
everyman
utopia
must
spring
in
the
private
bosom
before
it
can
flower
in
civic
virtue
man
is
a
soul
not
an
institution
his
inner
reforms
alone
can
lend
permanence
to
outer
ones
by
stress
on
spiritual
values
a
colony
exemplifying
world
brotherhood
is
empowered
to
send
inspiring
vibrations
far
beyond
its
locale
august
close
of
global
war
ii
end
of
a
world
dawn
of
an
enigmatic
atomic
age
the
hermitage
residents
gathered
in
the
main
hall
for
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
heavenly
father
may
never
it
be
again
thy
children
go
henceforth
as
brothers
gone
was
the
tension
of
war
years
our
spirits
purred
in
the
sun
of
peace
i
gazed
happily
at
each
of
my
american
comrades
lord
i
thought
gratefully
thou
hast
given
this
monk
a
large
family
a
small

i
translate

the
words
of

song
o
god
beautiful
o
god
beautiful
in
the
forest
thou
art
green
in
the
mountain
thou
art
high
in
the
river
thou
art
restless
in
the
ocean
thou
art
grave
to
the
serviceful
thou
art
service
to
the
lover
thou
art
love
to
the
sorrowful
thou
art
sympathy
to
the
yogi
thou
art
bliss
o
god
beautiful
o
god
beautiful
at
thy
feet
o
