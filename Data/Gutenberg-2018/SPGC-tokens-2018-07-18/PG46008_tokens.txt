i
wanted
a
haunted
house
but
i
it
so
for
fairbanks
saw
it
herself
and
heard
it
too
the
air
of
finality
in
the
gaze
levelled
at
braye
defied
contradiction
so
he
merely
smiled
at
the
girl
who
was
doing
the
talking
but
talking
or
silent
eve
carnforth
was
well
worth
smiling
at
her
red
hair
was
of
that
thin
silky
sort
that
spells
temper
but
looks
lovely
and
her
white
delicate
skin
perhaps
the
least
bit
showed
temperament
while
her
eyes
of
the
colour
called
beryl
whatever
that
is
showed
all
sorts
of
things
then
from
her
lips
fell
more
wisdom
and
professor
hardwick
believes
it
too
and
he
a
college
professor
broke
in
landon
do
try
to
gild
refinement
but
really
eve
you
must
believe
in
spooks
it
done
oh
but
it
is
you
no
idea
how
many
people
scientific
and
talented
people
are
leaning
toward
spiritualism
just
now
why
sir
oliver
lodge
says
that
after
the
war
great
and
powerful
assistance
will
be
given
by
spirit
helpers
in
matters
of
reconstruction
and
great
problems
of
science
milly
landon
laugh
rang
out
and
she
politely
clapped
a
little
fat
hand
over
her
mouth
to
stifle
it
milly
landon
was
an
inveterate
giggler
but
do
let
that
prejudice
you
against
her
she
was
the
nicest
dearest
dumpling
of
a
little
woman
who
ever
giggled
her
way
through
life
and
as
hostess
on
this
present
sunday
afternoon
occasion
she
sat
one
foot
tucked
under
her
on
the
davenport
in
her
long
narrow
parlour
on
one
of
new
york
east
seventieth
streets
it
was
a
parlour
like
thousands
of
others
in
the
city
and
the
quartette
of
people
talking
there
were
much
like
the
people
talking
in
those
other
parlours
that
sunday
afternoon
their
only
superiority
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
constitute
part
of
the
personnel
of
this
absorbing
tale
and
the
other
people
do
not
milly
and
her
very
satisfactory
husband
wynne
landon
were
affably
entertaining
rudolph
braye
and
the
described
eve
carnforth
two
pleasing
callers
and
the
talk
had
turned
on
psychological
matters
and
then
by
inevitable
stages
to
the
supernatural
and
spiritualism
it
is
all
coming
in
again
eve
declared
earnestly
you
know
it
was
taken
very
seriously
about
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
and
then
because
of
fake
mediums
and
fraudulent
séances
it
fell
into
disrepute
but
now
it
being
taken
up
in
earnest
and
i
for
one
am
terribly
interested
but
it
so
eve
and
milly
looked
at
her
guest
in
disdain
it
gammon
and
spinach
that
what
it
is
declared
landon
very
rubbishy
gammon
and
a
poor
quality
of
spinach
queen
victoria
did
think
so
eve
informed
them
she
may
have
been
but
she
believed
thoroughly
in
the
spiritual
reappearance
of
her
friends
who
died
and
especially
took
comfort
in
the
communion
and
visitation
of
her
dead
husband
it
this
way
i
think
offered
braye
it
seems
to
me
it
like
that
old
or
the
tiger
story
you
believe
or
not
according
to
your
character
or
disposition
you
know
it
depended
on
your
own
nature
whether
you
think
the
lady
came
out
of
the
door
or
the
tiger
and
so
with
spooks
if
you
want
to
believe
in
them
you
do
do
say
spooks
please
begged
eve
say
phantasms
or
even
ghosts
is
that
the
usage
in
the
best
mediumistic
circles
and
braye
smiled
well
i
think
i
could
more
easily
believe
in
a
spook
than
a
phantasm
the
latter
sounds
so
unreal
but
a
good
honest
injun
spook
seems
sort
of
plausible
they
all
unreal
began
landon
but
eve
interrupted
they
not
unreal
wynne
they
immaterial
of
course
but
that
is
being
unreal
you
have
a
real
soul
have
you
although
it
is
immaterial
and
i
suppose
you
do
call
your
mind
material
even
if
your
brain
is
now
you
quibbling
eve
and
landon
grew
a
bit
more
serious
when
i
say
unreal
i
mean
imperceptible
to
the
senses
i
hold
that
a
departed
spirit
can
not
return
to
earth
and
be
seen
heard
or
felt
by
mortal
human
beings
all
the
stories
of
such
things
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
if
you
or
any
one
else
has
power
to
show
me
a
visible
spook
i
beg
pardon
phantasm
i
be
glad
to
see
it
but
i
from
missouri
i
would
be
a
bit
afraid
of
it
but
i
have
to
be
jolly
well
convinced
of
its
integrity
no
spectres
would
go
down
with
me
but
how
can
you
know
asked
milly
i
be
scared
to
death
of
one
sure
but
if
wynne
wants
to
see
one
i
do
let
all
go
to
a
séance
or
whatever
they
call
the
things
shall
us
no
indeed
cried
eve
professional
séances
are
always
fakes
and
i
do
aspire
to
one
if
we
could
get
some
messages
from
the
beyond
that
would
satisfy
me
get
messages
how
asked
braye
oh
by
a
ouija
board
or
some
such
way
ouija
derided
landon
that
the
biggest
fraud
of
all
only
in
the
hands
of
frauds
if
we
tried
it
here
by
ourselves
and
if
we
all
trusted
each
other
not
to
stoop
to
deception
of
any
sort
that
would
be
a
fair
test
i
like
that
and
milly
giggled
in
pleased
anticipation
that
would
frighten
me
and
i
promise
to
play
fair
there
be
no
reason
for
not
playing
fair
said
eve
seriously
not
a
pack
of
silly
children
who
want
to
trick
one
another
if
we
could
get
together
some
evening
and
have
an
earnest
serious
test
i
agree
but
not
if
there
to
be
the
least
suspicion
of
anybody
trying
trickery
at
this
point
two
more
callers
arrived
and
milly
jumped
up
to
greet
them
mr
bruce
she
exclaimed
how
nice
to
see
you
and
vernie
my
goodness
how
you
grown
indeed
yes
and
vernie
reid
a
most
lively
and
energetic
of
sixteen
darted
from
one
to
another
greeting
all
with
interest
hello
cousin
rudolph
what
are
doing
here
mooning
after
miss
carnforth
i
dear
landon
let
me
sit
here
by
you
i
want
to
show
you
my
graduating
gifts
oh
yes
you
just
had
commencement
have
you
yes
and
uncle
gifford
gave
me
this
heavenly
and
my
respected
cousin
rudolph
over
there
sent
me
this
pendant
is
it
stunning
oh
i
had
beautiful
presents
i
like
to
graduate
every
year
are
you
going
to
school
any
more
at
all
dunno
yet
uncle
gifford
says
i
am
i
say
i
not
it
remains
to
be
seen
though
i
do
mind
confiding
to
you
that
i
usually
get
my
own
way
and
too
out
in
chicago
you
know
we
not
such
terrible
highbrows
something
tells
me
my
schooldays
are
over
i
think
uncle
gif
needs
the
pleasure
of
my
society
at
home
and
too
i
want
to
get
acquainted
with
cousin
rudolph
until
this
week
i
have
seen
him
for
years
he
is
your
cousin
vernie
same
as
he
a
son
of
uncle
gif
and
i
a
daughter
of
uncle
own
sister
so
it
sort
of
evens
up
anyway
i
like
cousin
rudolph
because
he
such
a
young
man
and
he
promised
to
take
me
round
new
york
some
that
why
i
so
jealous
of
miss
carnforth
or
any
other
girl
vernie
was
so
pretty
that
her
chatter
amused
the
whole
crowd
she
was
and
and
somewhat
of
a
browned
complexion
by
reason
of
much
tennis
and
outdoor
life
at
the
school
from
which
she
had
just
been
graduated
and
after
a
summer
spent
among
the
eastern
resorts
she
and
her
uncle
were
to
return
to
their
chicago
home
where
they
had
lived
all
of
vernie
orphaned
life
gifford
bruce
idolized
the
girl
and
though
often
short
and
crabbed
in
his
manner
to
others
he
was
never
cross
or
stern
to
his
dead
sister
child
what
were
you
talking
about
when
we
came
in
vernie
asked
smiling
at
milly
you
were
all
so
in
earnest
it
must
have
been
something
important
of
ghosts
answered
braye
looking
at
the
pretty
child
do
you
enjoy
them
oh
do
i
cried
vernie
why
at
school
we
just
ate
up
table
tippings
and
all
such
things
as
soon
as
lights
were
out
we
do
mean
that
sort
said
eve
we
were
talking
seriously
count
me
out
then
laughed
vernie
our
ghosts
were
a
bit
real
i
did
most
of
myself
jogging
the
table
when
the
others
did
know
it
eve
scarlet
lips
came
together
in
a
narrow
line
but
the
others
laughed
at
vernie
as
she
babbled
on
yes
and
we
tried
the
ouija
board
i
can
make
it
say
anything
i
want
to
good
for
you
kiddie
cried
braye
i
believe
i
like
your
notion
of
these
things
better
than
the
ideas
of
the
psychologists
it
sounds
a
lot
more
fun
and
comes
nearer
the
truth
declared
bruce
i
looked
up
these
matters
and
i
read
all
the
best
and
most
authoritative
books
on
the
subjects
there
are
many
writers
more
diffuse
and
circumstantial
but
andrew
lang
sums
up
the
whole
situation
in
his
able
way
he
says
there
are
no
ghosts
but
there
are
hallucinations
and
that
explains
all
it
does
to
me
and
eve
beryl
eyes
took
on
a
mystic
faraway
look
i
too
have
read
a
lot
of
books
scientific
or
psychic
interrupted
bruce
acidly
psychical
and
theosophic
rubbish
the
theosophic
bunch
have
been
in
the
discard
for
years
that
what
i
say
put
in
milly
the
whole
business
is
it
is
a
question
of
fashion
and
gifford
bruce
spoke
assuredly
the
subject
is
one
that
recurs
in
waves
as
many
such
things
do
why
there
have
been
ghosts
and
haunted
houses
in
people
imagination
ever
since
there
has
been
man
and
a
house
for
him
to
live
in
some
are
spoken
of
in
the
bible
the
primitive
australians
had
legions
of
ghosts
the
awful
dyaks
record
them
and
there
is
scarce
a
castle
or
palace
of
the
middle
ages
that
has
its
woman
in
white
or
a
little
gray
lady
or
the
man
in
black
and
in
an
old
egyptian
papyrus
there
an
account
of
a
defunct
lady
who
insisted
on
haunting
her
husband
to
his
great
distaste
my
goodness
uncle
gif
you
do
know
a
lot
about
it
and
vernie
went
over
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
tell
us
more
i
like
this
sort
of
ghost
stories
better
than
the
fool
stunts
we
did
at
school
i
not
telling
ghost
stories
child
i
only
declaring
that
ghost
stories
are
merely
and
in
no
case
a
true
relation
of
happenings
lang
investigated
thousands
of
cases
and
in
ten
out
of
every
eleven
he
states
fraud
was
proved
quite
so
said
eve
and
it
is
that
eleventh
case
that
interests
the
real
thinker
the
true
inquirer
but
the
eleventh
case
was
simply
not
proven
it
never
has
been
shown
that
it
was
really
a
ghostly
visitation
but
they
do
say
uncle
gifford
observed
braye
that
the
very
fact
of
the
frauds
being
perpetrated
proves
that
there
was
something
to
imitate
if
no
spirit
had
ever
returned
to
earth
and
made
itself
manifest
no
one
would
have
thought
of
pretending
that
one
did
nonsense
and
why
rudolph
perpetual
motion
is
not
a
real
thing
but
how
many
times
has
it
been
pretended
you
do
remember
the
keeley
motor
but
that
deceived
thousands
into
believing
that
perpetual
motion
was
at
last
discovered
but
it
was
and
that
fraud
does
prove
that
perpetual
motion
without
adequate
cause
exists
here
comes
professor
hardwick
exclaimed
milly
splendid
to
have
him
come
just
now
sit
down
professor
and
get
right
into
the
game
you
know
all
these
people
except
this
angel
child
miss
vernie
reid
i
am
an
angel
declared
vernie
but
i
no
child
i
just
graduated
with
honours
and
diplomas
and
lots
of
presents
now
i
out
in
the
great
world
and
glory
but
i
love
it
but
do
mind
me
professor
go
right
on
and
tell
us
all
you
know
about
ghosts
and
ghostesses
bless
my
soul
i
do
know
anything
about
them
well
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
what
do
you
mean
by
ghosts
how
do
you
define
a
ghost
ah
there
the
rub
said
landon
these
people
are
all
talking
at
cross
purposes
bruce
means
a
scarecrow
phantom
rigged
up
in
sheets
miss
carnforth
means
a
supernatural
being
of
some
sort
but
i
take
a
ghost
in
the
proper
sense
to
mean
the
visible
soul
of
some
one
who
has
died
what
do
you
mean
by
visible
soul
disembodied
no
considered
landon
i
suppose
i
mean
clothed
in
a
body
that
is
an
apparent
body
and
raiment
asked
the
old
professor
yes
certainly
i
never
heard
of
a
nude
spook
then
your
visible
soul
is
concealed
by
a
body
of
flesh
and
clothes
of
fabric
or
at
least
apparently
so
the
soul
i
take
it
would
show
but
low
visibility
good
hardwick
cried
bruce
give
them
a
jolt
they
need
it
talking
such
rubbish
rubbish
bruce
what
do
you
mean
by
rubbish
why
all
this
ghost
gabble
how
do
you
know
it
rubbish
have
you
personally
disproved
it
do
you
mean
intentional
rubbish
are
they
talking
deceptively
or
are
they
themselves
deceived
by
the
lord
harry
hardwick
i
had
forgotten
you
were
such
a
stickler
for
words
i
must
choose
my
diction
carefully
do
you
then
believe
that
supernatural
appearances
are
caused
by
psychical
influences
or
are
hallucinations
of
the
senses
there
i
think
i
put
it
clearly
fairly
so
but
i
ca
answer
clearly
i
never
express
an
opinion
on
a
grave
question
milly
hand
flew
up
to
her
mouth
to
repress
an
involuntary
giggle
a
question
she
exploded
it
surely
is
the
professor
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
it
is
he
went
on
and
it
is
no
laughing
matter
as
i
was
saying
i
never
state
an
opinion
without
being
sure
of
my
facts
now
i
had
no
experience
personally
with
supernatural
matters
and
so
am
unfit
to
discuss
them
but
i
admit
i
should
be
very
glad
to
have
some
such
experience
yes
i
certainly
should
really
and
eve
carnforth
looked
interested
i
can
arrange
it
for
you
professor
hardwick
no
no
my
dear
lady
i
do
not
mean
that
i
want
to
go
to
a
séance
where
the
medium
throws
flowers
and
things
out
of
a
cabinet
or
toots
trumpets
and
bangs
cymbals
no
thank
you
i
seen
such
often
what
would
you
choose
as
an
experience
asked
landon
i
like
to
go
to
a
house
that
is
reputed
haunted
and
in
circumstances
that
preclude
all
possibility
of
fraud
see
the
haunting
spirits
or
hear
them
for
myself
me
too
cried
vernie
oh
i
do
think
that
would
be
the
rippingest
fun
if
you
ever
do
it
professor
may
i
go
with
you
i
go
along
said
eve
would
that
be
a
splendid
proof
to
have
such
a
scientific
and
man
as
the
professor
and
a
few
others
who
are
in
earnest
and
anxious
to
learn
you
could
go
bruce
you
are
too
sceptical
i
just
the
one
you
need
he
laughed
a
balance
wheel
to
keep
you
enthusiasts
straight
but
haunted
houses
are
not
to
be
found
on
every
bush
in
america
if
we
were
in
england
now
or
scotland
they
do
have
some
over
here
landon
asserted
i
read
of
one
recently
and
i
heard
of
others
let
find
one
suggested
eve
and
spend
our
summer
vacation
in
it
would
that
be
a
lark
oh
do
exclaimed
vernie
i
just
love
it
may
i
go
uncle
gifford
oh
please
let
me
only
if
i
go
myself
child
the
spooks
i
beg
their
pardon
phantasms
might
carry
you
off
i
have
to
go
along
to
rescue
you
phantasms
do
carry
people
off
said
eve
contemptuously
and
though
i
like
to
consider
this
plan
i
only
do
so
if
we
were
all
in
earnest
as
investigators
whatever
our
opinions
may
be
come
on
let
go
said
landon
i
think
it
a
great
little
old
scheme
make
up
a
party
you
know
but
every
one
who
joins
must
promise
to
be
earnest
and
honest
must
promise
to
do
nothing
to
fool
or
mislead
the
others
but
keep
a
fair
and
open
mind
for
any
developments
of
course
there
wo
be
any
developments
but
we
can
have
a
jolly
time
and
we
can
have
wild
discussions
wynne
would
rather
have
a
discussion
than
eat
said
his
wife
i
go
and
i
be
the
housekeeper
and
chaperon
of
the
crowd
if
as
wynne
says
there
be
no
developments
i
love
the
outing
and
i
think
this
a
splendid
party
to
belong
to
and
let
take
norma
cameron
she
a
sensitive
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
she
help
you
out
eve
why
make
the
party
any
larger
asked
eve
a
little
petulantly
the
crowd
here
now
seems
just
right
and
congenial
and
all
that
why
lug
in
norma
said
braye
smiling
i
do
know
said
norma
but
i
agree
with
eve
that
the
party
here
is
just
sort
of
complete
yes
i
will
take
norma
the
poor
child
never
gets
an
outing
and
just
love
this
chance
you
talk
as
if
we
were
going
to
a
summer
resort
said
landon
in
the
first
place
milly
i
doubt
if
we
can
find
a
properly
haunted
house
in
a
pleasant
locality
that
is
for
rent
of
course
we
ca
declared
bruce
the
whole
scheme
is
idiotic
but
if
you
can
work
it
out
landon
i
go
along
and
take
this
little
piece
of
property
he
looked
smilingly
at
the
vernie
due
for
some
fun
after
her
school
work
and
if
she
likes
this
stunt
let
try
to
put
it
over
how
would
you
set
out
to
find
a
house
asked
braye
advertise
said
landon
promptly
i
know
a
firm
of
real
estate
agents
that
i
bet
could
manage
it
in
short
order
say
we
try
it
i
going
to
take
norma
insisted
milly
may
i
wynne
take
anything
or
anybody
you
wish
my
cherished
one
but
then
we
to
have
another
man
yes
said
milly
decidedly
i
hate
a
bunch
of
hens
without
plenty
of
menfolks
about
who
knows
a
nice
all
round
adaptable
dinner
man
i
know
just
the
chap
said
braye
but
he
a
minister
or
at
least
he
used
to
be
but
he
an
awfully
good
fellow
and
most
agreeable
parlour
company
what
his
name
asked
landon
tracy
i
met
him
first
in
chicago
some
years
ago
and
i
always
liked
him
all
right
if
milly
asks
norma
you
ask
your
friend
but
it
a
case
of
first
catch
your
house
it
got
to
be
a
nice
house
and
fairly
comfortable
milly
stipulated
or
i
wo
go
it
got
to
have
a
ghost
or
i
wo
go
laughed
braye
i
do
believe
in
the
things
but
i
like
to
have
a
chance
to
hear
their
clanking
chains
or
whatever
they
perform
on
i
go
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
said
vernie
and
if
we
do
catch
a
ghost
so
much
the
better
chapter
ii
the
old
montgomery
place
at
the
fisher
and
hibbard
real
estate
and
country
house
agency
wynne
landon
had
a
spirited
interview
with
their
fisher
and
finally
induced
that
somewhat
unwilling
gentleman
to
advertise
for
a
haunted
house
it
a
purely
business
matter
landon
argued
and
if
you
any
sort
of
a
live
agency
you
ought
to
do
your
best
to
get
for
your
clients
any
such
peculiar
domiciles
as
they
may
desire
i
understand
that
patiently
explained
fisher
but
it
such
a
crazy
thing
to
do
how
would
a
dignified
firm
like
ours
look
advertising
for
a
house
warranted
haunted
do
use
your
own
firm
name
then
have
answers
sent
to
a
fictitious
address
oh
you
can
manage
it
fisher
i
do
mean
you
can
surely
get
one
but
you
can
manage
to
try
and
if
the
house
is
pleasant
and
attractive
it
does
matter
between
you
and
me
if
there
is
any
ghost
after
all
but
i
want
a
story
i
mean
i
do
want
a
house
that
the
owner
pretends
is
haunted
just
so
he
can
rent
it
it
must
be
a
legend
or
ghost
story
connected
with
the
place
there
are
plenty
of
such
and
fisher
laughed
i
struck
them
occasionally
and
because
of
that
story
known
to
all
the
neighbours
i
could
rent
them
to
have
one
asked
for
is
a
new
experience
here
well
i
told
you
the
whole
state
of
the
case
you
see
why
we
want
it
and
though
the
ghost
part
is
the
primary
factor
with
some
of
us
my
wife
and
i
care
more
about
a
pleasant
setting
for
a
month
house
party
landon
personality
went
far
toward
gaining
his
end
and
fisher
promised
to
do
what
he
could
as
a
lawyer
of
fine
standing
and
a
man
of
ample
means
wynne
landon
was
a
desirable
man
to
please
and
the
order
was
taken
and
when
a
few
weeks
later
word
came
that
a
possible
opportunity
had
offered
landon
telephoned
for
braye
to
go
with
him
and
they
went
to
investigate
it
at
once
it
this
way
said
fisher
to
the
listening
men
there
a
big
house
up
in
vermont
in
the
green
mountain
region
not
so
very
far
from
manchester
but
it
a
lonely
locality
quite
high
up
and
near
a
lake
sounds
fine
so
far
commented
landon
go
on
a
man
named
stebbins
is
the
owner
i
have
seen
him
but
here
his
letter
read
it
you
get
the
idea
better
than
i
can
tell
you
so
they
read
fisher
and
hibbard
dear
sirs
i
got
a
house
and
it
sure
is
haunted
it
up
here
in
the
mountains
and
it
a
good
house
and
a
big
one
but
in
some
disrepair
leastways
things
is
and
not
as
you
may
say
up
to
date
but
nothing
ornery
all
and
proper
only
old
and
somewhat
wore
out
it
the
old
montgomery
mansion
built
along
about
and
something
but
it
been
added
to
since
and
it
a
sort
of
mixed
up
architecture
about
forty
rooms
into
it
i
should
judge
though
i
ai
never
counted
them
and
most
of
them
haunted
but
they
ai
no
use
going
into
particulars
unless
somebody
really
wants
to
rent
it
i
tried
nineteen
years
and
nobody
take
it
cause
so
lonesome
like
it
called
black
aspens
mostly
i
guess
cause
the
thick
groves
of
aspen
trees
all
around
look
black
at
night
and
lord
knows
it
a
fit
place
for
ghosts
anyway
it
haunted
and
i
can
swear
to
that
but
the
story
of
the
haunt
i
wo
set
down
until
i
hear
from
you
again
but
you
can
take
my
affydavy
it
a
real
haunt
and
there
a
real
reason
for
it
yours
truly
elijah
stebbins
sounds
good
to
me
what
do
you
think
rudolph
said
landon
all
right
if
it
genuine
some
of
us
ought
to
go
up
there
and
size
it
up
before
the
whole
crowd
goes
think
so
yes
unless
we
can
get
a
photograph
or
some
sort
of
a
plan
of
the
place
and
you
know
braye
i
do
care
such
a
lot
about
a
ghost
if
we
can
get
a
good
intelligent
crowd
of
people
together
that
the
only
sort
of
vacation
i
care
for
i
would
give
a
picayune
for
a
month
in
a
big
summer
hotel
or
a
little
summer
where
you
may
meet
good
talkers
and
you
may
not
but
with
eve
carnforth
and
norma
cameron
and
the
professor
and
pardon
the
bouquet
you
i
foresee
some
good
old
and
add
to
this
picturesque
even
wild
mountain
scenery
i
somehow
think
we
in
for
a
good
time
i
agree
wish
uncle
gif
and
vernie
were
going
though
he
a
dictatorial
old
chap
though
a
good
sport
and
as
to
vernie
i
think
it
the
right
place
for
a
flapper
oh
it
wo
hurt
the
kiddie
she
a
mighty
sensible
little
piece
and
she
ready
to
eat
up
experiences
she
may
as
well
be
with
her
own
people
that
just
it
she
lived
nearly
all
her
life
alone
with
uncle
and
he
is
enough
people
for
her
she
ought
to
have
a
woman
to
look
after
her
now
she
out
of
school
well
what
the
matter
with
milly
for
this
trip
at
least
milly
loves
the
little
girl
and
will
have
a
good
influence
over
her
that
right
as
rain
but
i
not
sure
eve
carnforth
is
desirable
company
for
vernie
oh
eve
is
a
bad
sort
and
with
her
strict
uncle
and
you
and
milly
and
me
to
look
after
the
child
eve
ca
do
much
to
counteract
she
probably
wo
do
anything
it
all
right
wynne
now
shall
we
decide
to
take
this
montgomery
place
oh
no
we
ca
decide
positively
i
pretty
sure
we
shall
take
it
but
i
think
we
ought
to
call
a
confab
of
the
whole
bunch
to
discuss
it
meantime
eve
carnforth
was
talking
it
over
with
milly
landon
i
adore
the
plan
eve
said
except
your
insistence
on
taking
norma
cameron
i
do
like
her
milly
and
you
know
it
now
eve
cunnin
little
cherub
child
do
let
the
monster
claim
you
for
his
own
you
know
well
milly
giggled
that
you
do
want
norma
along
because
you
think
she
will
attract
friend
braye
why
milly
landon
what
nonsense
i
do
care
two
cents
for
rudolph
braye
oh
i
do
mean
romantically
but
i
do
know
you
want
to
be
top
of
the
psychic
heap
up
there
and
you
think
little
norma
will
get
ahead
of
you
in
phantasmagoria
or
whatever
you
call
it
no
it
is
that
but
norma
does
think
she
knows
it
all
and
she
puts
on
such
airs
about
her
clairvoyance
and
calls
herself
a
sensitive
and
all
that
well
let
her
you
can
hold
your
own
and
too
eve
if
we
carry
out
this
scheme
i
think
we
ought
all
to
pull
together
and
help
each
other
and
we
ca
do
that
if
there
antagonism
or
rivalry
now
can
we
and
if
you
in
earnest
as
you
always
insisted
you
are
you
ought
to
be
glad
of
any
help
norma
can
give
she
feels
that
way
about
you
when
i
asked
her
to
go
she
was
delighted
that
you
were
to
be
in
the
party
because
she
said
you
were
so
interested
and
so
well
up
in
all
these
things
we
going
to
discover
i
suppose
i
am
silly
i
may
as
well
confess
i
not
sure
of
norma
she
would
be
above
pretending
she
heard
or
saw
things
even
if
she
did
fiddlesticks
there
wo
be
any
pretending
or
if
there
is
it
be
discovered
right
straight
off
why
wynne
is
terribly
in
earnest
about
having
it
all
fair
and
square
i
mean
and
so
is
the
professor
and
like
to
see
any
one
fool
gifford
bruce
and
little
vernie
is
a
real
wideawake
there
wo
be
anything
doing
that
that
child
does
know
if
it
fraud
or
foolery
do
you
believe
it
my
dear
norma
cameron
pull
any
wool
over
anybody
eyes
in
our
party
no
siree
the
crowd
came
together
that
night
to
discuss
the
house
that
had
been
offered
and
to
come
to
a
decision
norma
cameron
was
present
and
her
manner
and
appearance
were
so
exactly
opposite
to
those
of
eve
carnforth
that
it
was
small
wonder
the
girls
were
not
congenial
norma
was
blonde
and
had
what
her
friends
called
a
seraphic
countenance
and
her
enemies
a
for
norma
had
enemies
she
was
prominent
in
war
relief
work
and
public
charities
of
many
kinds
and
it
is
seldom
possible
for
such
a
one
to
go
through
the
world
entirely
peaceably
but
all
conceded
that
her
was
a
very
pretty
one
and
few
who
criticized
it
would
not
have
been
glad
to
wear
it
her
golden
hair
was
softly
curly
and
her
sky
blue
eyes
big
and
expressive
but
her
complexion
was
her
greatest
beauty
soft
as
a
rose
petal
the
pink
and
white
were
so
delicately
blended
as
to
make
a
new
observer
suspect
art
assistance
a
second
glance
however
removed
all
such
suspicion
for
no
hare
foot
could
ever
have
produced
that
degree
of
perfection
her
softly
rounded
chin
and
creamy
throat
were
exquisitely
moulded
and
her
usual
expression
was
gentle
and
amiable
but
norma
was
no
character
and
her
eyes
could
turn
to
deep
violet
and
her
pink
cheeks
flush
rosily
if
she
ran
up
against
unjustice
or
meanness
that
was
why
her
career
of
philanthropy
was
not
always
a
serene
path
for
she
never
hesitated
to
speak
her
mind
and
her
mind
was
of
a
positive
type
always
outspoken
though
was
norma
no
slyness
or
deceit
marked
her
procedure
never
did
she
say
behind
any
one
back
what
she
would
not
say
to
his
face
and
this
was
the
principal
reason
why
norma
and
eve
could
never
hit
it
off
for
eve
frequently
carried
tales
and
sometimes
denied
them
later
milly
however
was
friends
with
both
girls
and
secretly
hoped
that
if
they
could
all
get
away
together
the
two
warring
natures
might
react
on
each
other
for
good
then
too
both
were
immensely
interested
in
psychics
and
if
they
were
rivals
in
this
field
so
much
better
chance
for
all
concerned
to
find
out
the
things
they
were
to
look
for
i
think
said
norma
at
the
confab
it
would
be
better
for
two
of
the
crowd
say
and
landon
to
go
up
first
and
look
at
the
house
it
sounds
fine
but
it
may
be
impossible
so
why
get
us
all
up
there
only
to
come
home
again
i
do
think
so
said
eve
promptly
while
milly
giggled
to
hear
the
two
begin
to
disagree
at
once
i
think
it
would
be
a
lot
more
fun
for
us
all
to
go
and
see
it
for
the
first
time
together
then
if
it
livable
we
can
all
come
back
but
we
shall
have
had
a
sort
of
picnic
out
of
it
at
least
yes
i
think
that
too
put
in
vernie
who
was
beside
herself
with
joy
at
the
outlook
oh
what
a
gorgeous
party
it
will
be
do
we
go
in
the
train
or
motors
or
what
hush
vernie
said
her
uncle
we
have
decided
to
go
at
all
yet
where
is
this
place
landon
the
is
east
dryden
the
house
is
about
a
mile
further
up
the
mountain
i
fancy
it
a
picturesque
sort
of
a
place
though
with
few
modern
appointments
fisher
got
a
little
more
data
somehow
and
he
says
it
a
old
pile
as
to
architecture
as
it
been
rebuilt
or
added
to
several
times
but
i
do
care
about
all
that
i
mean
if
we
do
like
the
appointments
we
need
stay
what
i
want
is
the
ghost
story
shall
we
send
to
stebbins
for
that
before
we
take
the
place
or
go
on
a
wild
goose
chase
entirely
oh
let
start
off
without
knowing
anything
about
it
and
old
bruce
eyes
twinkled
like
a
boy
at
thought
of
an
escapade
good
for
you
uncle
and
vernie
shouted
with
glee
i
did
know
you
were
such
an
old
top
did
you
cousin
rudolph
well
i
known
him
longer
than
you
have
flapper
and
i
not
so
surprised
at
his
wanting
a
sporting
proposition
but
i
say
milly
if
we
going
to
take
tracy
you
people
ought
to
see
him
and
give
him
the
once
over
first
maybe
you
wo
like
him
at
all
oh
your
friends
are
sure
to
be
our
friends
rudolph
said
landon
but
telephone
him
to
run
up
here
ca
you
it
only
fair
to
let
him
in
on
the
planning
tracy
came
and
he
made
good
at
once
his
ministerial
air
was
softened
by
a
charming
smile
and
a
certain
chivalry
of
address
that
pleased
the
women
and
satisfied
the
men
what
about
servants
he
asked
after
the
main
details
had
been
explained
to
him
that
what
i
thinking
about
said
milly
i
do
want
to
take
our
servants
they
be
scared
to
death
in
such
a
place
and
too
we
go
ghost
hunting
under
charles
nose
he
sniff
at
us
right
you
are
agreed
landon
charles
is
one
estimable
and
valuable
butler
but
he
no
sort
to
take
on
the
picnic
we
out
for
do
let
take
any
servants
suggested
eve
but
get
some
up
there
natives
you
know
that
would
be
better
said
bruce
then
they
be
used
to
the
place
and
can
tell
us
of
the
legends
and
traditions
you
see
you
poking
fun
said
eve
reproachfully
but
it
true
all
the
same
do
we
go
in
motors
i
think
so
said
landon
two
big
cars
would
take
us
all
and
we
can
leave
our
luggage
to
be
sent
up
if
we
stay
of
course
we
stay
asserted
milly
i
love
that
old
house
already
and
if
there
no
ghost
at
all
i
be
just
as
well
pleased
and
stay
the
month
out
with
whoever
wants
to
stay
with
me
i
stand
by
you
said
norma
and
i
own
up
that
i
do
really
expect
any
spectral
manifestations
up
there
anyway
it
matters
little
what
you
expect
and
professor
hardwick
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
we
going
investigating
not
expecting
do
you
expect
anything
prof
asked
vernie
gaily
what
do
you
mean
by
expect
child
do
you
mean
wish
or
think
gracious
goodness
professor
i
never
know
what
i
mean
by
the
words
i
use
and
i
never
care
professor
hardwick
hobby
was
the
use
of
words
and
rarely
did
he
fail
to
question
it
if
a
word
was
misused
or
uncertainly
used
in
his
presence
but
he
smiled
benignly
on
the
pretty
child
and
did
bother
her
further
finally
the
men
drew
together
to
make
up
the
budget
of
necessary
expenses
and
the
women
talked
clothes
smocks
all
round
said
norma
who
loved
the
unconventional
in
dress
not
for
me
said
eve
who
did
milly
giggled
let
every
one
wear
just
what
she
chooses
she
settled
it
i
at
my
best
in
white
linen
in
the
summer
time
but
what
about
laundry
well
i
shall
leave
two
sets
of
things
packed
and
then
send
for
whichever
i
want
norma
uninterested
in
clothes
edged
over
toward
the
men
though
a
friend
of
the
landons
and
acquainted
with
professor
hardwick
she
had
never
met
braye
or
tracy
before
both
succumbed
to
her
smile
but
tracy
showed
it
and
braye
did
sit
here
miss
cameron
and
tracy
eagerly
made
a
place
for
her
at
his
side
we
need
a
lady
assistant
how
much
do
you
think
it
ought
to
cost
to
provision
nine
people
and
two
or
three
natives
for
a
month
it
is
a
question
of
what
it
to
cost
returned
norma
but
what
it
cost
but
in
any
case
it
will
be
less
than
most
of
us
would
spend
if
we
went
to
the
average
summer
hotel
so
why
not
just
put
down
some
round
numbers
divide
by
nine
and
let
it
go
at
that
fine
approved
landon
no
food
dictator
could
beat
that
scheme
i
wonder
if
are
as
hungry
as
other
hunters
or
if
we
be
so
scared
we
lose
our
appetites
i
have
a
profound
belief
in
ghosts
norma
asserted
but
i
shall
only
indulge
in
it
between
meals
count
me
in
for
all
the
good
things
going
three
times
a
day
what
do
you
mean
by
profound
asked
the
professor
or
widely
informed
both
answered
norma
flashing
her
pretty
smile
at
the
serious
old
man
profundity
of
all
kinds
is
my
happy
and
on
this
trip
i
expect
to
get
all
the
profundity
i
want
and
i
the
girl
to
put
the
fun
in
profundity
cried
vernie
coming
over
to
them
my
mission
is
to
keep
you
serious
people
joyed
up
tracy
your
profession
wo
interfere
with
your
having
a
jolly
time
will
it
no
i
see
it
wo
by
that
twinkly
little
smile
you
may
count
on
me
said
the
clergyman
a
bit
stiffly
but
with
a
cordial
glance
at
the
girl
and
i
can
wind
professor
hardwick
round
my
finger
vernie
went
on
for
a
companion
on
a
gay
lark
i
do
know
any
one
better
than
a
old
college
professor
the
object
of
this
encomium
received
it
with
a
benignant
smile
but
gifford
bruce
reproved
his
saucy
niece
i
leave
you
at
home
miss
if
you
talk
impertinences
he
declared
not
much
you
wo
my
bestest
belovedest
uncle
why
i
the
leading
lady
of
this
troupe
and
i
expect
the
spectre
will
appear
to
me
first
of
all
that
my
motto
the
spectre
how
that
then
the
rest
of
you
can
inspect
the
spectre
vernie
do
be
so
excruciatingly
funny
begged
braye
while
milly
landon
giggled
at
the
pretty
child
whose
charm
and
sweetness
took
all
rudeness
from
her
foolery
perhaps
we
ought
to
call
in
an
inspector
to
inspect
the
spectre
contributed
landon
there
there
wynne
said
braye
we
take
such
stuff
from
an
ignorant
little
girl
but
not
from
a
man
ignorant
huh
scorned
vernie
i
bet
could
have
passed
my
examination
in
psychology
perhaps
not
admitted
braye
but
after
this
trip
of
ours
we
all
be
honour
men
i
want
it
thoroughly
understood
said
bruce
that
i
range
myself
on
the
side
of
the
sceptics
i
do
want
to
sail
under
false
colours
and
i
wish
to
state
positively
that
there
are
no
ghosts
or
phantasms
or
any
such
things
moreover
i
announce
my
intention
of
fooling
you
gullible
ones
if
i
can
oh
that
is
fair
exclaimed
landon
i
do
believe
in
the
things
either
but
i
want
an
honest
test
why
you
take
away
the
whole
point
of
the
experiment
if
you
going
to
put
up
a
trick
on
us
no
no
bruce
said
the
professor
that
wo
do
come
now
give
me
your
word
there
be
no
or
i
refuse
to
go
at
all
if
it
any
sort
of
a
real
test
hardwick
it
ought
to
be
possible
to
fool
you
that
true
said
eve
and
i
not
afraid
of
any
tricks
if
they
are
tricks
i
know
it
i
too
said
norma
i
sensitive
to
all
psychical
manifestations
and
if
i
ca
tell
a
real
phantasm
from
bruce
tricks
i
deserve
to
be
fooled
i
think
it
a
good
thing
that
bruce
warned
us
observed
john
tracy
it
puts
us
on
our
guard
but
i
think
the
rest
of
us
ought
to
agree
not
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
we
can
expect
and
discount
bruce
little
game
but
if
others
are
going
to
do
the
same
it
seems
to
me
the
game
is
worth
playing
right
you
are
declared
landon
and
forthwith
everybody
present
except
gifford
bruce
solemnly
pledged
his
or
her
word
to
do
nothing
tricky
or
fraudulent
and
to
preserve
an
honest
attitude
toward
any
developments
they
might
experience
and
with
eight
inquirers
watching
him
bruce
ca
put
anything
over
opined
landon
and
the
others
agreed
chapter
iii
black
aspens
though
it
was
a
chilly
dusk
through
which
the
two
motor
cars
ascended
the
last
stretch
of
mountain
road
toward
the
old
montgomery
mansion
the
sun
set
early
behind
the
green
mountains
and
the
house
up
an
eastern
slope
appeared
faintly
through
the
shadows
to
the
right
tall
forest
trees
waved
their
topmost
branches
with
an
eerie
soughing
sound
or
stood
menacingly
silent
in
black
sullen
majesty
beneath
them
a
tangled
underbrush
gave
forth
faint
rustling
hints
of
some
wild
life
or
suddenly
ceased
to
a
grim
stillness
then
the
road
lay
through
a
thick
grove
of
aspens
close
black
and
shivering
as
they
stood
sentinel
like
and
fearsome
only
dimly
outlined
against
the
dark
clouded
sky
once
in
the
grove
the
shadows
were
dense
and
the
quivering
sounds
seemed
intensified
to
a
muttered
protest
against
intrusion
a
strange
bird
gave
forth
a
few
raucous
notes
and
then
the
dread
silence
returned
a
quick
damp
chill
foreboded
still
water
and
the
road
followed
the
margin
of
a
small
lake
or
pond
sinister
in
its
inky
depths
which
mirrored
the
still
blacker
aspen
trees
suddenly
in
a
small
clearing
they
came
upon
the
house
in
the
uncertain
light
it
seemed
enormous
shapeless
and
beyond
all
words
repelling
it
seemed
to
have
a
personality
defiant
and
forbidding
that
warned
of
mystery
and
disaster
aspen
trees
tall
and
gaunt
grew
so
close
that
their
whispering
leaves
brushed
the
windows
and
crowded
in
protecting
huddled
clumps
to
ward
off
trespassers
no
lights
showed
through
the
deep
caverns
of
the
windows
but
one
faint
gleam
flickered
above
the
entrance
door
whew
cried
landon
jumping
from
his
seat
with
a
thud
on
the
stone
terrace
i
wo
go
through
that
woods
again
i
go
home
in
an
aeroplane
and
i
ready
to
go
now
so
am
i
said
milly
in
a
quivering
tearful
voice
oh
wynne
why
did
we
ever
come
now
now
cheered
braye
keep
your
heads
it
all
right
only
these
confounded
shadows
make
it
impossible
to
know
just
where
we
at
the
house
and
by
jinks
it
built
of
marble
of
course
said
the
professor
who
was
curiously
feeling
of
the
old
stone
this
is
the
marble
country
you
know
vermont
marble
was
plenty
enough
when
this
house
was
put
up
let
get
in
begged
vernie
it
is
as
much
fun
as
i
thought
it
would
be
they
went
in
a
close
group
up
a
short
flight
of
broad
marble
steps
and
reached
a
wide
portico
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
spacious
vestibule
indented
into
the
building
and
which
stood
within
the
main
wall
though
the
walls
of
the
house
were
of
marble
those
of
this
vestibule
were
of
panelled
mahogany
and
the
entrance
doorway
was
flanked
on
either
side
by
large
bronze
columns
which
stood
half
within
and
half
without
the
mahogany
wall
some
house
exclaimed
tracy
in
admiration
of
the
beautiful
details
which
though
worn
and
blackened
by
time
were
of
antique
grandeur
these
bronze
doors
must
have
come
from
italy
they
marvellous
i
glad
i
came
oh
do
get
in
wynne
wailed
milly
you
can
examine
the
house
i
we
had
come
landon
was
about
to
make
search
for
knocker
or
bell
when
one
of
the
big
bronze
doors
swung
open
and
a
man
peered
out
you
folks
here
he
said
a
bit
unnecessarily
bring
another
lamp
hester
yes
we
here
landon
assured
him
and
we
want
to
get
in
out
of
the
wet
rainin
and
the
man
stepped
out
of
the
door
to
look
blocking
all
ingress
no
that
a
figure
of
speech
landon
nerves
were
on
edge
open
that
door
the
other
one
let
us
in
go
on
in
who
henderin
you
and
the
indifferent
host
stepped
out
of
the
way
landon
went
in
first
and
braye
followed
as
the
others
crowded
after
at
first
they
could
see
only
a
gloomy
cavernous
hall
its
darkness
accentuated
by
one
small
lamp
on
a
table
thought
i
would
light
up
till
you
got
here
and
the
man
who
had
admitted
them
came
in
and
closed
the
door
i
stebbins
and
here
the
keys
this
is
the
house
you
took
and
hester
here
will
look
after
you
i
be
goin
no
you
wo
and
landon
turned
on
him
why
man
we
know
nothing
of
this
place
you
stay
till
i
dismiss
you
i
want
a
whole
lot
of
information
but
not
till
after
we
get
lights
and
make
the
ladies
comfortable
comfortable
at
black
aspens
not
likely
the
mocking
laugh
that
accompanied
these
words
struck
terror
to
most
of
his
hearers
nobody
told
me
that
you
folks
came
up
here
to
be
comfortable
shut
up
landon
temper
was
near
the
breaking
point
where
that
woman
with
the
lamps
where
the
man
i
engaged
to
look
after
things
hester
she
here
she
be
in
in
a
minute
thorpe
that
her
husband
he
goin
to
be
a
sort
of
butteler
for
you
he
ca
come
till
but
hester
she
got
supper
ready
or
will
be
soon
you
can
wash
up
and
all
hester
came
in
then
a
gaunt
new
england
woman
who
looked
utterly
devoid
of
any
emotion
and
most
intelligence
stebbins
on
the
other
hand
was
apparently
of
keen
perceptions
and
average
intellect
his
small
blue
eyes
roved
from
one
face
to
another
and
though
he
looked
sullen
and
disagreeable
of
disposition
he
gave
the
effect
of
one
ready
to
do
his
duty
all
right
he
said
as
if
without
interest
i
set
in
the
kitchen
and
wait
hester
here
she
take
the
ladies
to
their
rooms
and
then
after
you
get
your
supper
i
tell
you
all
you
ask
me
but
i
rented
this
place
to
you
i
did
agree
to
be
a
signboard
and
almanac
all
right
old
chap
and
landon
smiled
faintly
but
do
you
get
away
till
i
see
you
now
girls
want
to
select
your
rooms
began
eve
bravely
and
then
a
glance
up
the
dark
staircase
made
her
shudder
what
we
want
is
light
and
plenty
of
it
broke
in
braye
here
you
hester
i
relieve
you
of
that
lamp
you
holding
and
you
hop
it
and
get
more
six
more
twelve
more
hear
me
we
have
that
many
in
the
house
the
woman
looked
at
him
with
that
sublime
stolidity
only
achieved
by
born
new
englanders
oh
you
have
well
bring
all
you
have
and
you
manage
to
raise
a
lot
more
how
many
have
you
all
told
four
i
think
four
for
a
party
of
nine
well
have
you
candles
half
a
dozen
and
three
candlesticks
i
suppose
bring
them
in
and
if
you
shy
of
candlesticks
bring
old
bottles
or
anything
good
for
you
braye
did
know
you
had
so
much
generalship
and
gifford
bruce
clapped
his
nephew
on
the
shoulder
i
glad
i
believe
in
ghosts
for
every
last
one
of
you
people
are
shaking
in
your
shoes
this
minute
what
the
matter
with
you
nothing
has
happened
it
was
that
awful
ride
through
the
woods
said
vernie
cuddling
into
her
uncle
arm
i
it
i
like
it
all
but
the
local
colour
is
so
so
dark
that
it
kiddie
said
braye
the
local
colour
is
about
the
murkiest
i
ever
struck
but
here
are
our
lights
hooray
hester
brought
two
more
small
hand
lamps
and
after
another
trip
to
the
kitchen
brought
six
candles
and
six
battered
but
usable
candlesticks
a
candle
was
given
to
each
of
the
four
women
and
norma
politely
selected
the
oldest
and
most
broken
holder
land
sake
exclaimed
stebbins
coming
in
you
goin
to
use
candlestick
that
the
very
one
the
murderin
woman
used
with
a
scream
norma
dropped
it
and
no
one
moved
to
pick
it
up
get
out
stebbins
roared
landon
you
queer
the
whole
business
i
take
this
one
and
bruce
picked
up
the
old
brass
affair
not
afraid
of
such
things
here
miss
cameron
take
mine
it
new
and
commonplace
i
assure
you
and
trembling
norma
took
the
cheap
crockery
thing
and
shortly
they
all
followed
hester
up
the
stairs
to
the
shadows
of
the
floor
above
the
place
was
silent
as
the
grave
hester
slippered
feet
made
no
sound
and
a
voluntary
scraping
of
tracy
shoes
stopped
as
soon
as
he
realized
its
enormous
sound
in
those
empty
halls
a
multitude
of
doors
led
to
rooms
in
all
directions
there
seemed
to
be
no
plan
or
symmetry
of
any
sort
the
candle
flames
flickered
the
small
lamps
burned
with
a
pale
sickly
light
hester
paused
midway
of
the
main
corridor
what
rooms
you
want
she
asked
uninterestedly
give
me
a
cheerful
one
wailed
milly
oh
wynne
let
us
take
a
little
cozy
one
of
course
you
shall
said
braye
kindly
hester
which
is
the
pleasantest
room
in
the
house
give
that
to
and
landon
and
then
we
put
all
you
girls
near
them
the
rest
of
us
will
camp
anywhere
let
all
pretty
much
camp
anywhere
till
suggested
the
professor
i
like
to
select
my
room
by
daylight
i
made
up
some
of
the
rooms
and
some
i
ai
volunteered
hester
then
for
heaven
sake
show
us
the
rooms
and
get
out
burst
forth
landon
i
wish
we
brought
our
maids
milly
that
woman
affects
me
like
fever
and
ague
but
after
a
time
they
were
assigned
to
various
more
or
less
inhabitable
bedrooms
and
as
quickly
as
possible
all
reappeared
in
the
great
hall
below
ready
for
supper
the
dining
room
toward
the
back
of
the
house
was
not
half
bad
after
all
the
available
lights
had
been
commandeered
for
the
table
you
knew
there
were
no
electrics
said
braye
to
eve
who
was
bewailing
the
fact
of
course
i
did
and
i
thought
candles
would
be
lovely
and
picturesque
and
all
that
and
kerosene
gives
a
good
soft
light
but
well
somehow
do
you
know
what
i
thought
as
we
came
through
that
dreadful
wood
what
only
one
sentence
rang
through
my
mind
and
that
was
the
powers
of
darkness
that
is
a
sentence
objected
the
professor
a
little
querulously
and
everybody
laughed
also
everybody
blessed
the
occasion
for
laughter
but
eve
went
on
i
do
care
if
it
a
sentence
or
a
syllogism
or
what
it
is
it
just
rang
in
my
ears
and
i
tell
you
this
whole
place
is
under
the
powers
of
darkness
do
hush
eve
pleaded
milly
i
was
just
beginning
to
pull
myself
together
and
now
you
upset
me
again
but
milly
let
up
eve
for
the
love
of
mike
let
up
you
enough
to
give
anybody
the
creeps
landon
glared
at
her
it
only
a
question
of
light
tracy
broke
in
in
his
pleasant
way
now
we
light
enough
for
the
moment
and
we
make
this
the
house
of
a
thousand
candles
and
a
hundred
lamps
and
a
few
lanterns
if
you
like
incidentally
friend
hester
makes
doughnuts
are
they
bully
chimed
in
vernie
i
eaten
six
and
here
goes
for
another
lucky
they
small
said
her
uncle
but
seven
doughnuts
are
enough
to
make
you
see
the
ghost
of
old
montgomery
himself
and
all
the
green
mountain
boys
added
tracy
who
was
determined
to
keep
conversation
away
from
fearsome
subjects
by
the
time
they
had
finished
the
meal
every
one
felt
more
at
ease
landon
had
recovered
his
poise
and
milly
her
cheerfulness
now
then
the
professor
asked
as
they
left
the
table
shall
we
explore
the
house
lord
no
cried
braye
leave
it
lay
till
daylight
also
do
quiz
old
stebbins
as
to
who
who
in
black
aspens
let
turn
on
the
victrola
and
dance
or
let
play
poker
or
sing
glees
or
anything
that
a
proper
parlour
trick
but
nothing
i
insist
pertaining
to
our
mission
up
here
that
keep
as
you
like
and
now
landon
could
smile
and
you
mollycoddles
may
pursue
those
pleasures
but
i
going
to
have
it
out
with
steb
because
i
want
to
know
some
several
laws
for
beginners
but
let
me
interfere
with
your
plans
go
ahead
and
have
play
and
seek
all
over
the
house
if
you
choose
that
used
to
be
my
favourite
indoor
game
oh
squealed
vernie
what
an
awful
suggestion
in
this
house
i
move
we
hear
the
story
of
the
house
right
now
said
eve
milly
clasped
her
hands
over
her
ears
instead
of
as
usual
over
her
mouth
and
cried
no
i
forbid
it
do
let
will
you
wynne
seems
to
me
remarked
stebbins
you
folks
do
know
your
own
minds
you
want
a
house
then
when
you
git
it
you
too
scared
to
hear
the
story
of
the
i
not
scared
asserted
norma
but
somehow
a
sounds
so
much
worse
than
a
haunt
does
it
now
it
sure
does
agreed
braye
a
is
concrete
while
a
haunt
is
abstract
good
and
hardwick
nodded
approval
now
i
suggest
that
we
look
around
a
bit
get
the
general
lay
of
the
house
and
then
all
go
to
bed
early
a
good
night
sleep
will
put
our
nerves
and
muscles
in
condition
again
i
delighted
with
the
place
and
i
foresee
a
vacation
ahead
of
us
i
wish
it
was
behind
us
and
we
were
just
starting
for
home
murmured
milly
but
eve
reprimanded
her
do
be
a
spoilsport
i
like
the
place
too
professor
and
i
going
to
investigate
a
little
what
room
is
this
eve
graceful
figure
crossed
the
great
square
hall
where
they
were
all
standing
about
and
paused
at
the
closed
door
of
a
room
just
at
the
right
hand
as
one
entered
the
house
why
it
locked
she
exclaimed
that
wo
do
stebbins
this
whole
domain
is
ours
now
you
know
open
this
door
please
eve
wore
the
light
gray
skirt
of
her
travelling
costume
and
a
thin
sheer
white
silk
blouse
whose
v
neck
fell
away
from
her
long
slender
throat
her
hand
on
the
door
knob
she
suddenly
turned
her
strange
beryl
eyes
toward
stebbins
her
face
turning
whiter
and
her
thin
lips
redder
as
she
gazed
this
is
the
room
is
it
she
breathed
and
her
hand
slowly
fell
from
the
knob
and
hung
loosely
at
her
side
yes
replied
stebbins
stolidly
how
you
know
how
could
i
help
knowing
and
eve
voice
rang
out
like
a
clarion
i
see
it
i
see
it
all
she
rushed
across
the
hall
and
fell
trembling
on
a
settee
tracy
flew
to
her
side
and
took
her
hand
there
there
miss
carnforth
brace
up
we
all
right
here
nothing
can
hurt
you
beats
all
how
she
knew
muttered
stebbins
you
see
that
the
room
a
cry
from
milly
stirred
landon
to
action
drop
it
stebbins
he
said
and
took
a
step
toward
him
none
of
that
we
do
want
your
haunted
house
but
the
long
journey
up
here
and
your
confounded
negligence
in
the
matter
of
lights
and
servants
and
general
good
will
has
got
on
the
ladies
nerves
beat
it
now
to
the
kitchen
or
wherever
your
quarters
are
but
you
stay
here
and
be
ready
to
report
in
the
morning
you
hear
me
yes
sir
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
man
disappeared
among
the
shadows
in
the
back
of
the
hall
the
great
main
hall
was
so
large
that
the
lights
they
had
were
all
insufficient
for
illumination
there
seemed
to
be
innumerable
doors
and
openings
of
side
corridors
also
a
second
staircase
far
behind
the
main
one
here
a
room
let
go
in
here
said
tracy
stepping
through
some
old
faded
draperies
to
the
room
on
the
left
of
the
hall
as
one
entered
the
house
hardwick
followed
and
the
others
with
lamps
and
candles
pushed
in
it
was
a
large
dignified
apartment
evidently
a
parlour
or
ballroom
of
the
old
mansion
the
furniture
was
of
old
carved
rosewood
its
upholstery
worn
but
fairly
decent
oil
portraits
were
on
the
walls
and
massive
ornaments
of
imitation
bronze
stood
about
showing
white
here
and
there
where
the
coating
was
chipped
off
yellowish
onyx
vases
graced
the
mantels
and
the
windows
were
hung
with
heavy
rep
curtains
which
however
veiled
no
lighter
ones
ghastly
cried
norma
what
do
you
mean
by
ghastly
began
the
professor
and
tracy
laughed
she
did
mean
it
at
all
professor
he
said
miss
cameron
meant
to
say
hideous
now
do
ask
me
what
i
mean
by
hideous
just
look
at
the
interior
decorations
here
and
draw
your
own
conclusions
as
to
my
meaning
but
though
not
to
be
called
æsthetic
this
furniture
is
fairly
comfy
the
springs
of
this
sofa
are
intact
come
sit
by
my
side
little
darling
this
last
to
vernie
who
was
and
alert
lapping
up
these
strange
new
impressions
all
right
and
she
flung
herself
down
beside
him
you
a
real
comfort
tracy
you
so
so
unministerial
thank
you
my
child
one
need
carry
one
pulpit
voice
into
social
life
oh
i
do
mean
you
do
or
say
anything
that
a
man
of
your
calling
ought
to
but
you
so
nice
about
it
i
think
so
too
chattered
milly
i
do
think
a
clergyman
with
a
sense
of
humour
makes
a
fine
combination
the
mental
atmosphere
gradually
lightened
and
when
landon
suggested
they
all
retire
it
was
a
composed
and
merry
hearted
group
that
obeyed
the
summons
when
twelve
sonorous
strokes
boomed
from
the
tall
clock
in
the
upper
hall
the
men
beneath
the
roof
of
black
aspens
were
all
sleeping
more
or
less
soundly
milly
with
only
occasional
little
quivering
shudders
slumbered
in
landon
arms
vernie
slept
with
the
sound
dreamless
sleep
of
youth
but
eve
and
norma
were
wide
awake
and
unable
to
close
their
eyes
in
adjoining
rooms
the
communicating
door
ajar
they
could
hear
one
another
toss
restlessly
but
they
said
no
words
norma
blue
eyes
were
wide
open
her
thoughts
rambling
over
the
strange
surroundings
in
which
she
found
herself
and
her
mind
leaping
forward
speculating
on
what
might
happen
eve
her
long
glittering
eyes
half
closed
listened
for
any
sound
her
nerves
alert
her
thoughts
darting
from
material
things
to
the
supernatural
every
muscle
tense
with
a
nameless
apprehension
more
hours
were
rung
out
by
the
old
clock
and
at
last
dawn
began
to
creep
in
at
the
deep
narrow
windows
of
the
old
house
with
a
shrug
and
a
stretch
vernie
awoke
drowsily
in
the
half
light
she
tried
to
make
out
her
surroundings
and
then
suddenly
remembering
where
she
was
she
dove
her
head
under
her
blanket
in
a
quick
rush
of
fear
then
curiosity
conquered
and
she
came
to
the
surface
again
and
looked
about
the
light
growing
gradually
stronger
showed
the
appointments
of
the
room
the
ugly
old
bedstead
of
light
wood
apple
or
hickory
the
heavy
rep
lambrequins
that
seemed
to
be
a
feature
of
the
house
and
the
scantily
appointed
dresser
on
which
the
night
before
she
had
set
her
extinguished
candle
shadows
still
lurked
in
the
corners
of
the
room
still
hung
round
the
draperies
and
furniture
yet
through
the
gloom
vernie
saw
something
that
made
her
eyes
stare
and
her
flesh
creep
clenching
her
hands
till
her
sharp
nails
bit
into
her
palms
she
gave
a
shriek
that
rang
through
the
silent
house
chapter
iv
the
story
of
the
house
from
their
nearby
rooms
eve
and
norma
rushed
to
vernie
room
the
child
was
huddled
beneath
the
bed
clothes
and
at
their
entrance
shot
her
head
out
crying
wildly
look
look
the
old
candlestick
milly
came
running
in
and
slippers
and
from
distant
regions
came
the
voices
of
the
men
what
the
matter
asked
gifford
bruce
was
that
vernie
voice
yes
uncle
gif
vernie
called
out
oh
did
you
do
it
do
what
and
in
his
hastily
donned
bath
robe
old
bruce
appeared
why
and
vernie
was
calm
now
there
that
old
candlestick
the
one
the
the
murderer
used
on
my
dresser
last
night
i
had
a
little
china
one
what
are
you
talking
about
a
murderer
wake
up
child
i
not
asleep
but
i
see
now
you
had
this
old
one
uncle
gif
and
you
know
you
said
you
were
going
to
fool
us
if
you
could
and
so
you
sneaked
it
in
here
to
pretend
the
haunt
did
it
what
what
nonsense
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
who
did
then
you
know
you
had
this
one
last
night
i
certainly
did
wonder
what
in
my
room
now
bruce
ran
back
to
his
room
and
returned
with
the
little
china
candlestick
vernie
had
carried
to
her
room
the
night
before
they
had
certainly
been
exchanged
during
the
night
everybody
stared
at
the
two
candles
so
worthless
in
themselves
but
so
inexplicably
transferred
if
as
he
declared
gifford
bruce
had
not
exchanged
them
of
course
i
did
do
it
he
repeated
angrily
i
did
say
in
fun
that
i
meant
to
trick
you
but
when
i
saw
how
nervous
and
wrought
up
all
you
women
were
last
night
i
would
dream
of
doing
such
a
thing
why
vernie
i
think
too
much
of
you
dear
to
add
to
your
fear
or
discomfort
in
any
way
at
last
everybody
concluded
it
was
the
work
of
some
one
of
their
number
and
there
were
varying
opinions
as
to
the
identity
of
the
perpetrator
of
what
must
have
been
meant
for
a
joke
but
at
breakfast
time
the
matter
was
discussed
very
seriously
and
each
avowed
in
all
honour
that
he
or
she
knew
nothing
of
it
i
can
speak
not
only
for
myself
said
professor
hardwick
gravely
but
for
tracy
and
braye
they
would
have
had
to
pass
my
door
to
move
around
the
halls
and
i
was
awake
all
night
looking
and
listening
and
i
know
they
did
not
leave
their
rooms
i
speak
for
myself
said
gifford
bruce
haughtily
i
declare
on
my
oath
that
i
did
not
leave
my
bed
somebody
exchanged
those
candles
but
it
was
not
i
the
landons
spoke
for
each
other
and
no
one
of
course
could
suspect
wynne
or
milly
and
naturally
the
two
girls
eve
and
norma
would
not
go
to
bruce
room
to
play
a
trick
like
that
i
do
mind
now
said
vernie
when
it
all
light
and
cheerful
and
you
all
around
me
and
the
breakfast
is
so
good
and
all
i
think
the
beginning
of
these
experiences
we
came
up
here
to
look
for
why
are
you
all
so
surprised
because
i
had
the
first
party
the
girl
was
unafraid
now
but
hardwick
shook
his
head
i
do
like
it
he
said
we
ca
investigate
if
there
a
trickster
among
us
you
did
do
it
yourself
did
you
vernie
no
professor
and
the
pure
truthful
gaze
of
the
brown
eyes
left
no
room
for
disbelief
honest
i
did
but
she
laughed
mischievously
if
i
had
i
should
i
had
vernie
this
wo
do
and
eve
glared
at
her
you
little
minx
i
believe
you
did
do
it
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
eve
carnforth
stop
it
you
scare
me
vernie
fairly
cowered
before
eve
basilisk
eyes
i
believe
did
it
there
there
girls
broke
in
tracy
with
his
gentle
smile
do
get
to
if
we
all
finished
breakfast
let
now
hear
the
story
of
the
house
and
then
we
can
tell
if
its
patron
ghost
is
the
sort
given
to
exchanging
bedroom
furniture
o
nights
yes
agreed
norma
i
crazy
to
hear
the
story
where
stebbins
does
anybody
know
i
dig
him
up
landon
assured
them
where
shall
we
congregate
in
the
drawing
room
said
milly
that
the
only
room
i
not
afraid
of
i
fearfully
afraid
of
that
said
tracy
in
mock
terror
those
rep
lambrequins
get
on
my
nerves
are
they
awful
and
norma
laughed
they
do
frighten
me
but
they
jar
my
æsthetics
terribly
no
said
elijah
stebbins
firmly
as
the
conclave
began
not
in
that
there
parlour
here
in
the
hall
you
folks
want
this
house
you
want
the
story
of
this
house
now
you
sit
here
to
hear
it
very
well
said
braye
agreeably
just
as
you
say
stebbins
now
begin
at
the
beginning
but
do
drool
too
long
a
spiel
the
whole
party
grouped
themselves
in
the
great
hall
and
for
the
first
time
began
to
take
in
the
details
of
its
appointments
though
in
disrepair
as
to
walls
and
cornices
the
lines
of
its
architecture
were
fine
and
it
was
of
noble
proportions
the
staircase
was
beautifully
planned
and
the
wonderful
bronze
doors
which
they
had
not
examined
the
night
before
were
truly
works
of
art
the
old
montgomery
who
brought
them

of

which
lord

to

had
for
the
pickin
up
here
get
along
to
the
story
steb
urged
landon
yes
sir
well
the
montgomery
that
built
this
house
though
it
was
part
built
before
he
added
on
to
his
father
house
well
he
was
a
daredevil
and
a
tyrant
little
mite
of
a
man
but
full
of
the
old
nick
and
as
those
little
men
will
do
he
married
a
hessian
of
a
woman
big
sort
o
long
and
gaunt
they
say
she
was
and
a
termagant
for
sure
she
led
him
a
life
and
also
he
led
her
one
for
he
was
a
terror
and
so
was
she
what
he
lacked
in
size
he
made
up
in
temper
and
she
had
both
well
here
the
story
he
took
sick
and
she
nursed
him
they
did
have
trained
nurses
and
specialists
in
them
days
now
some
says
he
was
jest
naturally
took
sick
and
some
says
that
she
give
him
slow
poison
but
be
that
as
it
may
one
night
she
give
him
prussic
acid
and
he
died
she
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
ran
screamin
to
the
village
for
the
doctor
i
remorse
got
her
for
she
confessed
and
said
killed
him
i
killed
him
at
four
i
killed
him
she
went
crazy
they
say
then
and
there
well
the
doctor
he
said
come
right
away
but
she
ran
home
first
and
he
followed
fast
he
could
and
when
he
come
here
was
the
woman
and
she
was
a
washin
the
dead
man
lips
she
said
to
get
the
smell
of
the
bitter
ammonds
off
you
know
prussic
acid
is
for
all
the
world
the
smell
of
bitter
almonds
the
doctor
he
found
the
man
was
really
dead
and
he
was
for
havin
her
arrested
but
she
was
so
plumb
crazy
he
decided
to
take
her
to
an
asylum
instead
he
had
to
go
off
to
get
help
and
he
left
her
here
alone
in
this
house
with
the
body
they
was
in
that
room
stebbins
pointed
to
the
room
with
the
locked
door
at
the
right
hand
of
the
hall
as
one
entered
the
room
with
the
tassels
it
called
why
is
it
called
that
broke
in
eve
whose
piercing
eyes
were
fairly
glittering
with
excitement
what
sort
of
tassels
great
heavy
tassels
on
the
curtains
and
lambaquins
want
to
see
it
not
now
ordained
landon
the
story
first
well
resumed
stebbins
they
was
in
that
room
the
dead
husband
and
the
live
wife
when
the
doctor
went
away
and
because
he
knew
she
was
out
of
her
head
he
locked
in
and
when
he
came
back
she
was
setting
there
just
where
he
left
her
still
in
a
dazed
sort
o
stupor
and
the
corpse
was
gone
gone
where
rasped
out
the
professor
nobody
knows
nobody
ever
knew
it
had
just
disappeared
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
the
doctor
and
the
village
folks
all
agreed
that
it
was
sperrited
away
that
woman
she
could
get
out
o
the
doors
to
cart
it
off
and
she
could
got
out
of
a
winder
with
it
without
showin
some
signs
and
if
she
had
what
in
the
world
could
she
done
with
it
it
was
buried
nowhere
around
and
if
she
threw
it
in
the
lake
she
got
out
a
winder
how
she
got
in
again
anyhow
that
the
story
and
they
all
said
she
was
a
witch
and
she
bewitched
the
body
away
so
the
doctor
and
sheriff
could
smell
the
prussic
acid
on
it
and
hang
her
for
murder
they
searched
and
searched
but
they
could
find
no
signs
of
her
havin
even
moved
outen
her
chair
she
sat
there
like
a
dead
woman
herself
when
the
doctor
left
her
and
likewise
when
he
come
back
the
tale
is
very
circumstantial
observed
gifford
bruce
a
bit
drily
i
tellin
it
as
i
many
a
time
heard
it
sir
said
stebbins
a
little
resentfully
this
here
story
been
common
talk
around
these
parts
a
many
years
and
i
ai
one
to
add
to
nor
take
from
it
go
on
commanded
landon
briefly
they
put
her
away
in
a
loonytic
asylum
and
she
died
in
it
they
never
found
hide
nor
hair
of
the
dead
man
and
the
place
fell
to
some
kin
that
lived
down
pennsylvania
way
they
come
up
here
for
a
while
i
but
the
scared
off
it
been
sold
some
several
times
and
at
last
it
fell
to
my
father
family
now
it
mine
and
it
a
white
elephant
to
me
i
ca
sell
or
rent
it
and
so
you
folks
may
well
believe
i
jumped
at
the
chance
to
have
you
take
it
for
a
spell
we
have
heard
about
the
haunt
yet
said
norma
she
spoke
quietly
but
her
lips
quivered
a
little
and
her
fingers
were
nervously
picking
at
her
handkerchief
that
and
stebbins
looked
even
more
sombre
than
he
had
that
my
own
experience
so
i
can
give
it
to
you
first
hand
i
come
here
to
live
ten
years
ago
and
i
was
plucky
enough
to
hoot
at
ghost
stories
and
tales
o
so
i
set
out
to
sleep
in
that
that
room
with
the
tassels
out
o
sheer
bravado
but
i
got
enough
of
it
the
man
head
fell
on
his
breast
and
he
paused
in
his
narrative
go
on
said
landon
less
brusquely
than
before
milly
stirred
nervously
do
let
him
tell
the
rest
wynne
she
said
oh
yes
dear
remember
this
is
what
we
here
for
most
of
the
men
shifted
their
positions
hardwick
leaned
forward
both
hands
on
his
knees
gifford
bruce
sat
with
one
arm
flung
carelessly
over
his
chair
back
a
slight
smile
on
his
face
braye
was
beside
norma
and
watched
alternately
her
face
and
eve
while
tracy
was
holding
vernie
hand
and
his
gentle
calm
kept
the
volatile
child
quiet
i
see
it
all
so
plainly
that
first
night
stebbins
said
slowly
night
land
there
never
was
another
not
for
me
i
sooner
died
than
slep
in
that
room
again
see
a
ghost
asked
bruce
flippantly
yes
sir
and
stebbins
looked
straight
at
him
i
seen
a
ghost
i
a
sound
sleeper
i
am
and
i
went
to
sleep
quiet
and
ca
as
a
baby
i
woke
as
the
big
clock
there
was
a
strikin
four
it
was
that
what
woke
me
i
hope
is
there
is
there
a
bed
in
that
room
asked
the
professor
lord
yes
it
was
them
folkses
bedroom
in
them
days
people
most
always
slep
downstairs
i
come
awake
suddenly
and
the
room
was
full
of
an
icy
chill
not
just
coldness
but
a
damp
chill
like
undertakers
iceboxes
vernie
shuddered
and
tracy
held
her
hand
more
firmly
landon
slipped
his
arm
round
milly
and
eve
and
norma
glanced
at
each
other
gifford
bruce
replaced
his
sneering
smile
which
had
somehow
disappeared
it
was
winter
and
plumb
dark
at
four
in
the
morning
but
the
room
was
full
of
an
unearthly
light
a
sort
of
frosty
white
glow
like
you
see
in
a
graveyard
sometimes
and
comin
toward
me
was
a
tall
gaunt
figure
with
a
shawl
over
its
head
a
white
misty
shape
that
had
a
sort
of
a
halting
step
but
was
comin
straight
and
sure
toward
that
bed
i
was
lyin
on
i
tried
to
scream
i
tried
to
move
but
i
could
i
was
paralyzed
on
and
on
came
the
thing
halting
at
every
step
but
gettin
nearer
and
nearer
as
she
oh
i
knew
it
was
that
woman
i
thought
it
was
a
man
who
was
murdered
put
in
bruce
in
his
most
sardonic
tones
so
it
was
sir
stebbins
spoke
mildly
but
it
was
the
murderess
the
i
she
ca
rest
quiet
in
her
grave
for
remorse
and
that
she
came
nearer
and
and
i
saw
her
face
and
well
and
it
was
a
skull
a
grinning
skull
and
her
long
bony
hand
held
a
glass
a
glass
of
poison
for
me
er
did
you
take
it
this
from
bruce
no
sir
i
swooned
away
or
whatever
you
may
call
it
i
lost
all
consciousness
and
when
i
come
to
the
thing
was
gone
ever
see
her
again
inquired
bruce
conversationally
no
sir
and
stebbins
eyed
him
uninterestedly
it
was
impossible
to
annoy
the
story
teller
no
i
never
her
heard
her
asked
braye
yes
many
the
time
but
i
ai
never
slept
in
that
room
since
i
should
say
not
cried
eve
but
i
will
i
brave
the
phantasm
be
glad
to
see
her
i
not
afraid
you
need
be
said
bruce
with
a
short
laugh
you
wo
see
anything
miss
carnforth
i
be
willing
to
try
it
too
what
other
manifestations
have
you
experienced
asked
braye
what
have
you
heard
mostly
groans
and
hollow
laughter
interrupted
bruce
those
are
the
regulation
sounds
i
believe
oh
hush
cried
eve
bruce
you
drive
me
frantic
i
wish
you
had
come
i
do
declared
bruce
i
think
it
most
interesting
and
do
i
understand
stebbins
that
this
charming
lady
of
large
size
and
hard
heart
carried
usually
that
candlestick
that
i
made
use
of
last
night
at
last
stebbins
resented
bruce
chaff
so
the
story
goes
sir
he
said
curtly
and
many
the
time
known
that
candlestick
to
be
moved
during
the
night
by
no
mortal
hand
look
here
uncle
gif
said
braye
you
do
want
to
get
yourself
disliked
do
you
now
let
up
on
your
quizzing
and
get
down
to
business
we
set
out
for
a
haunted
house
i
for
one
think
we
got
all
we
came
after
and
then
some
if
the
began
moving
her
candlestick
around
the
first
night
what
may
she
not
do
next
you
do
it
did
you
uncle
i
told
you
i
did
rudolph
and
i
again
repeat
my
word
but
it
was
scarcely
necessary
for
me
to
do
it
when
such
a
capable
spook
i
mean
phantasm
is
regularly
in
attendance
now
i
told
you
the
tale
and
stebbins
rose
and
shook
himself
as
if
he
had
done
his
duty
i
ai
nowise
responsible
for
your
believin
it
what
i
told
you
is
true
so
far
my
own
experience
goes
and
what
i
told
you
hearsay
is
the
old
story
that
been
told
up
in
these
parts
by
one
generation
after
another
since
old
montgomery
day
now
do
you
want
to
see
the
room
with
the
tassels
i
do
cried
milly
i
ca
stand
any
more
you
need
dear
said
landon
suppose
you
go
out
on
the
terrace
and
walk
about
in
the
sunlight
you
go
with
her
vernie
you
can
see
the
room
later
on
i
go
too
and
tracy
tactfully
offered
his
escort
the
tassels
will
keep
come
on
braye
no
i
see
the
show
through
you
can
look
after
the
ladies
tracy
so
the
others
crowded
round
stebbins
as
he
prepared
to
unlock
the
door
of
the
fatal
room
no
great
sight
he
said
almost
apologetically
but
it
the
room
slowly
he
turned
the
key
and
they
all
filed
in
the
room
was
dark
save
for
what
light
came
in
from
the
hall
all
blinds
were
closed
and
over
the
windows
hung
heavy
curtains
of
rep
that
had
once
been
red
but
was
now
a
dull
nondescript
colour
there
were
more
of
these
heavy
long
curtains
evidently
concealing
alcoves
or
cupboards
and
over
each
curtain
was
a
lambrequin
edged
with
thick
twisted
woolen
fringe
and
at
intervals
tassels
enormous
weighty
tassels
such
as
were
once
used
in
church
pulpits
and
other
upholstery
such
quantities
of
these
there
were
that
it
is
small
wonder
the
room
received
its
name
and
the
tassels
had
a
sinister
air
motionless
they
hung
dingy
faded
but
still
of
an
individuality
that
seemed
to
say
we
have
seen
unholy
deed
we
cry
out
mutely
for
vengeance
it
was
them
tassels
that
scared
me
most
stebbins
said
in
an
awed
tone
i
mean
before
come
they
sort
of
swayed
when
they
no
draught
nor
anything
i
do
wonder
said
braye
they
the
ghostliest
things
i
ever
saw
but
the
whole
room
is
awful
it
oh
i
say
put
up
a
window
i
ca
said
stebbins
simply
these
here
windows
ai
been
up
for
years
and
years
the
springs
is
all
rusted
and
wo
work
there
something
in
the
room
cried
eve
hysterically
i
mean
something
besides
us
something
alive
no
said
stebbins
solemnly
what
in
here
ai
alive
i
ai
been
in
here
myself
since
that
night
i
slep
here
and
i
would
be
now
only
to
show
you
folks
the
room
i
sort
of
feel
if
i
shifted
the
responsibility
to
you
folks
now
i
do
seem
to
feel
the
same
fear
of
the
like
i
was
here
alone
say
stop
it
and
eve
almost
shrieked
at
him
yes
ghost
but
it
is
and
it
will
be
till
the
crack
o
doom
air
ye
all
satisfied
with
your
bargain
no
one
answered
for
every
one
was
conscious
of
a
subtle
presence
and
each
glanced
fearfully
furtively
about
nerves
shaken
wills
enfeebled
vitality
low
what
is
it
whispered
eve
imagination
declared
bruce
but
he
shook
his
shoulders
as
he
spoke
as
if
ridding
himself
of
an
incubus
there
was
a
chilliness
that
was
not
like
honest
cold
there
was
a
stillness
that
was
not
an
ordinary
silence
and
there
was
an
impelling
desire
in
every
heart
to
get
out
of
that
room
and
never
return
but
all
were
game
and
when
at
last
stebbins
said
seen
enough
they
almost
tumbled
over
one
another
in
a
burst
of
relief
at
the
thought
of
exit
the
great
hall
seemed
cheerful
by
contrast
and
landon
in
a
voice
he
strove
to
make
said
thank
you
stebbins
you
have
certainly
given
us
what
we
asked
for
yes
sir
did
you
notice
it
sir
what
the
smell
the
odour
in
that
room
i
did
said
eve
i
noticed
the
odour
of
prussic
acid
yes
said
stebbins
that
what
i
meant
chapter
v
eve
experience
the
investigators
had
investigated
for
a
week
they
were
now
having
tea
in
the
great
hall
to
whose
shadowy
distances
and
shabby
appointments
they
had
become
somewhat
accustomed
kept
up
to
the
mark
by
the
landons
old
jed
thorpe
had
developed
positive
talents
as
a
butler
and
with
plenty
of
lamps
and
candles
and
a
couple
of
willing
if
ignorant
maids
the
household
machinery
ran
fairly
smoothly
supplies
were
procured
in
east
dryden
or
sent
up
from
new
york
markets
and
by
day
the
party
was
usually
a
country
house
group
every
day
at
they
recounted
any
individual
experiences
that
might
seem
mysterious
and
discussed
them
it
this
way
professor
hardwick
summed
up
the
determining
factor
is
the
dark
ghosts
and
haunted
houses
are
all
very
well
at
night
but
daylight
dispels
them
as
a
sound
breaks
silence
what
about
my
experience
when
i
slept
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
growled
gifford
bruce
braye
laughed
you
queered
yourself
uncle
gif
when
you
announced
before
we
started
that
you
were
not
bound
to
good
faith
ghost
stories
are
discounted
before
you
tell
but
i
did
see
a
shape
a
shadowy
form
like
a
tall
woman
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
you
dreamed
it
said
milly
smiling
at
him
or
else
milly
dare
say
it
laughed
eve
but
i
will
or
else
you
invented
the
yarn
if
i
to
be
called
a
tut
tut
bruce
intervened
tracy
nobody
called
you
one
playful
prevarication
is
all
right
especially
as
you
warned
us
you
fool
us
if
you
could
now
i
can
tell
an
experience
and
justly
expect
to
be
believed
but
you
have
had
any
and
eve
translucent
eyes
turned
to
him
i
have
began
tracy
slowly
but
they
been
a
bit
indefinite
unsatisfactory
to
present
only
an
impression
or
a
suggestion
where
facts
are
wanted
and
the
professor
says
truly
that
hints
and
haunts
are
convincing
at
night
but
repeated
at
a
pleasant
comfortable
tea
hour
they
sound
flimsy
and
unconvincing
what
did
you
think
you
saw
or
heard
asked
norma
with
a
reminiscent
look
in
her
eyes
every
morning
or
almost
every
morning
at
four
i
seem
to
hear
the
trailing
robes
of
a
presence
of
some
sort
i
seem
to
hear
a
faint
moaning
sound
that
is
like
nothing
human
that
imagination
said
braye
promptly
it
is
doubtless
agreed
hardwick
but
it
is
due
to
what
may
be
called
attention
if
we
had
not
connected
four
with
the
story
of
this
house
tracy
would
not
have
those
hallucinations
at
that
time
perhaps
so
the
clergyman
looked
thoughtful
but
it
seems
vivid
and
real
at
the
time
then
in
the
later
morning
it
is
merely
a
hazy
memory
you
know
stebbins
said
that
every
one
who
died
in
this
house
always
died
at
four
i
know
he
so
and
braye
looked
quizzical
oh
come
now
do
doubt
honest
old
stebbins
and
eve
frowned
we
must
believe
tales
or
we
never
get
anywhere
i
going
over
to
east
dryden
to
see
him
i
want
a
few
more
details
and
it
seems
to
me
we
getting
nowhere
with
our
imaginations
and
hallucinations
now
i
going
to
sleep
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
i
no
fear
of
it
and
i
have
a
deep
and
great
curiosity
oh
let
me
sleep
there
with
you
may
i
eve
oh
please
let
me
vernie
danced
about
in
her
eagerness
and
knelt
before
eve
pleading
no
vernie
i
forbid
it
said
her
uncle
decidedly
if
miss
carnforth
wants
to
do
this
thing
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
you
must
not
my
child
i
know
you
people
do
believe
me
but
i
surely
saw
an
apparition
the
night
i
slept
there
and
it
was
no
human
trickster
neither
was
it
hallucination
i
was
as
wideawake
as
i
am
now
we
know
the
rest
uncle
gif
and
braye
laughingly
interrupted
the
recital
stalking
ghost
hollow
groans
and
were
there
clanking
chains
there
were
not
but
in
its
shrouded
hand
the
spectre
held
a
glass
of
prussic
acid
of
which
you
smelt
the
strong
odour
yes
i
know
but
it
wo
go
down
old
chap
the
prussic
acid
wo
and
landon
chuckled
nor
the
tale
either
said
the
professor
it
too
true
the
shawled
woman
filled
the
specifications
too
accurately
to
seem
convincing
you
a
nice
crowd
grumbled
bruce
come
up
here
for
experiences
and
then
hoot
at
the
first
real
thing
that
happens
all
your
own
fault
retorted
norma
if
you
had
advertised
your
propensity
for
fooling
us
your
word
would
have
carried
weight
all
right
let
somebody
else
sleep
in
that
room
then
but
not
miss
carnforth
let
one
of
the
men
try
it
thank
you
none
for
me
said
braye
i
detest
shawled
women
waking
me
up
at
four
to
take
my
poison
i
beg
off
too
said
tracy
i
wake
at
four
every
morning
anyway
with
those
aspen
boughs
shivering
against
my
windows
i
trim
them
off
but
that
does
seem
like
playing
the
game
wynne
sha
sleep
there
and
that
settles
and
milly
grasp
on
her
husband
coat
sleeve
was
evidently
sufficiently
detaining
that
leaves
only
me
of
the
men
asserted
the
professor
i
quite
willing
to
sleep
in
that
room
indeed
i
want
to
i
only
been
waiting
till
i
felt
sure
of
the
house
the
servants
and
excuse
me
the
members
of
our
own
party
now
i
discovered
that
the
servants
quarters
can
be
securely
locked
off
so
that
they
can
not
get
in
this
part
of
the
house
i
found
that
the
outside
doors
and
the
windows
can
be
fastened
against
all
possibility
of
outside
intrusion
and
i
shall
stipulate
that
our
party
shall
so
congregate
in
a
few
rooms
that
no
one
can
ahem
haunt
my
slumbers
without
some
one
else
knowing
it
i
ask
you
three
young
ladies
to
sleep
in
one
room
and
allow
me
to
lock
you
in
or
two
adjoining
rooms
to
which
i
may
hold
all
keys
tracy
bruce
and
braye
i
shall
arrange
similarly
while
the
landons
must
also
consent
to
be
imprisoned
by
me
this
is
the
only
way
i
can
make
a
fair
test
will
you
all
agree
splendid
cried
eve
of
course
we
will
but
professor
let
me
try
it
first
if
you
should
have
a
weird
experience
it
might
scare
me
off
but
now
i
am
brave
enough
oh
please
do
that
let
me
lock
you
all
in
your
rooms
and
let
me
sleep
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
oh
please
say
yes
all
of
you
i
i
must
try
it
the
girl
looked
like
a
seeress
as
with
glittering
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
she
plead
her
cause
why
of
course
if
you
want
to
miss
carnforth
said
the
professor
looking
at
her
admiringly
i
be
glad
to
have
the
benefit
of
your
experience
before
testing
myself
and
there
is
positively
no
danger
as
i
said
the
locks
bolts
and
bars
are
absolutely
safe
against
outside
intrusion
or
visits
from
the
servants
though
we
know
are
not
to
be
suspected
and
as
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
supernatural
i
can
see
no
argument
against
your
plan
suppose
i
go
with
you
suggested
norma
her
large
blue
eyes
questioning
eve
carnforth
excited
face
no
norma
not
this
time
i
prefer
to
be
alone
i
lock
you
and
vernie
in
your
room
i
lock
milly
and
wynne
in
their
room
i
lock
you
four
men
in
two
rooms
and
then
i
know
i
that
whatever
i
see
or
hear
is
not
a
fraud
or
trick
of
and
i
think
you
can
trust
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
in
the
morning
if
there
anything
to
tell
supplemented
braye
i
think
eve
as
to
ghosts
you
cutting
off
your
source
of
supply
then
we
merely
prove
nothing
but
i
determined
to
try
again
vernie
begged
to
be
allowed
to
share
eve
experiences
but
neither
bruce
nor
eve
herself
would
consider
the
child
request
every
one
of
us
the
professor
said
musingly
has
told
of
hearing
mysterious
sounds
and
of
seeing
mysterious
shadows
but
except
for
bruce
graphic
details
all
our
observations
have
been
vague
and
uncertain
they
may
well
have
been
merely
imagination
but
miss
carnforth
is
not
imaginative
i
mean
not
so
to
the
exclusion
of
a
fair
judgment
of
what
her
senses
experience
therefore
i
shall
feel
if
she
sees
nothing
that
i
shall
see
nothing
when
i
sleep
in
that
room
night
i
am
especially
well
adapted
for
the
test
eve
said
though
in
no
way
proudly
for
i
have
a
premonition
that
the
phantasm
will
appear
to
me
more
readily
than
to
some
others
remember
i
knew
that
was
the
haunted
room
before
we
had
been
told
i
knew
it
before
we
entered
the
house
that
first
night
it
was
revealed
to
me
as
other
things
have
been
even
during
our
stay
here
you
must
realize
that
i
am
a
sensitive
and
so
better
fitted
for
these
visitations
than
a
more
phlegmatic
or
practical
person
what
else
has
been
revealed
to
you
eve
asked
braye
perhaps
revealed
is
just
the
word
rudolph
but
i
seen
more
than
most
of
you
i
heard
voices
rustling
as
of
wings
and
other
inexplicable
sounds
that
i
know
were
audible
only
to
me
lord
eve
you
give
me
the
creeps
finished
your
tea
come
out
for
a
walk
then
let
get
off
these
subjects
if
only
for
half
an
hour
that
night
eve
carnforth
carried
out
her
plans
to
the
letter
gifford
bruce
and
his
nephew
braye
in
one
room
the
professor
and
tracy
in
another
were
locked
in
by
eve
amid
much
gaiety
of
ceremony
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
braye
declared
tracy
look
after
the
professor
that
he
does
jump
out
of
the
window
and
you
professor
watch
tracy
they
ca
jump
out
the
windows
said
eve
practically
they
too
high
and
if
they
could
they
could
get
in
the
tasseled
room
those
windows
wo
open
and
too
i
know
the
professor
wo
let
tracy
out
of
his
sight
or
rudolph
you
tie
your
uncle
if
he
shows
signs
of
roving
eve
strong
nerves
gave
no
sign
of
tension
as
she
completed
all
her
precautionary
arrangements
she
locked
the
doors
that
shut
off
the
servants
quarters
she
locked
the
landons
in
their
room
she
locked
the
door
of
the
room
that
norma
and
vernie
occupied
and
at
last
with
various
gay
messages
shouted
at
her
through
the
closed
portals
she
went
downstairs
to
keep
her
lonely
vigil
she
did
not
undress
for
she
had
no
intention
of
sleeping
that
night
a
kimono
and
her
hair
comfortably
in
a
long
braid
were
her
only
concessions
to
relaxation
she
lay
down
on
the
hard
old
bed
and
gazed
about
her
a
single
lamp
lit
the
room
and
she
had
a
candle
also
in
case
she
desired
to
use
it
the
light
made
strange
shadows
the
heavy
faded
hangings
seemed
to
sway
and
move
but
whether
they
really
did
so
or
not
eve
could
determine
she
got
up
and
went
to
examine
them
the
feel
of
them
was
damp
and
unpleasant
they
seemed
to
squirm
under
her
hand
and
she
hastily
dropped
them
and
returned
to
the
bed
there
was
an
uncanny
creepy
atmosphere
that
disturbed
her
in
spite
of
her
strong
nerves
and
indomitable
will
she
had
locked
the
door
now
she
arose
and
took
the
key
out
and
laid
it
on
a
table
she
had
heard
that
a
key
in
a
lock
could
be
turned
from
the
other
side
then
on
a
sudden
impulse
she
put
out
the
lamp
feeling
utter
darkness
preferable
to
those
weird
shadows
but
the
darkness
was
too
horrible
so
she
lighted
the
candle
it
was
not
in
the
historic
old
brass
candlestick
but
in
a
gay
affair
of
red
china
and
the
homely
cheap
thing
somewhat
reassured
her
as
a
bit
of
modernity
and
real
life
she
listened
for
a
long
time
imagining
sighs
or
sounds
which
she
could
not
be
sure
she
really
heard
the
whispering
aspens
outside
were
audible
and
their
continued
soughing
was
monotonously
annoying
but
not
frightful
because
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
it
at
last
her
nerves
wearied
her
physical
nature
refused
further
strain
and
eve
slept
a
light
fitful
sleep
interspersed
with
waking
moments
and
with
sudden
swift
dreams
but
she
kept
fast
hold
of
her
perceptive
faculties
if
she
slept
and
woke
she
knew
it
she
heard
the
aspens
sounds
the
hours
struck
by
the
great
hall
clock
and
the
sound
of
her
own
quick
short
breathing
nothing
else
until
just
as
the
clock
tolled
the
last
stroke
of
four
she
heard
a
low
grating
sound
was
some
one
at
the
door
she
was
glad
she
had
taken
out
the
key
the
candle
still
burned
but
its
tiny
light
rather
accentuated
than
lifted
the
gloom
of
the
shadowy
room
slowly
and
noiselessly
the
door
swung
open
inward
into
the
room
eve
tried
to
sit
up
in
bed
but
could
not
she
felt
paralyzed
not
so
much
frightened
as
numbed
with
physical
dread
and
then
with
a
slow
gliding
motion
entered
something
tall
gaunt
and
robed
in
long
draperies
it
was
unreal
shadowy
in
its
aspect
it
was
only
dimly
visible
in
the
gloom
but
it
gave
the
impression
of
a
frightened
furtive
personality
that
hesitated
to
move
yet
was
impelled
to
a
soft
moan
as
of
despair
came
from
the
figure
and
it
put
out
a
long
white
hand
and
pinched
out
the
candle
flame
then
with
another
sigh
eve
could
in
the
utter
black
darkness
that
the
thing
was
coming
to
her
side
with
all
her
might
she
tried
to
cry
out
but
her
vocal
cords
were
dumb
she
made
no
sound
but
she
felt
with
all
her
senses
she
the
apparition
draw
nearer
at
her
bedside
it
paused
she
knew
this
by
a
sort
of
sixth
sense
for
she
heard
or
saw
nothing
then
she
was
conscious
of
a
faint
odour
of
prussic
acid
its
pungent
bitterness
unmistakable
though
slight
and
then
a
tiny
flame
as
of
a
wick
without
a
candle
flashed
for
a
second
disappeared
and
eve
almost
fainted
she
did
not
entirely
lose
consciousness
but
her
brain
reeled
her
head
seemed
to
spin
round
and
her
ears
rang
with
a
strange
buzzing
for
in
the
instant
gleam
of
that
weird
light
she
had
seen
the
face
of
the
phantom
and
it
was
the
face
of
a
skull
it
was
the
ghastly
countenance
of
a
death
head
half
conscious
but
listening
with
abnormal
sense
she
thought
she
descried
the
closing
of
the
door
but
could
hear
no
key
turn
the
knowledge
that
she
was
alone
gave
her
new
life
she
sprang
up
lighted
the
candle
lighted
the
lamp
and
looked
about
all
was
as
she
had
arranged
it
the
door
was
locked
the
key
untouched
upon
the
table
nothing
was
disturbed
but
eve
carnforth
knew
that
her
experience
whatever
its
explanation
had
not
been
a
dream
when
her
senses
had
reeled
she
had
not
lost
entire
control
of
them
through
her
physical
fear
she
had
kept
her
mental
balance
and
she
that
what
her
brain
had
registered
had
actually
occurred
alert
she
lay
for
a
long
time
thinking
it
over
she
felt
sure
there
would
be
no
return
of
the
spectre
she
felt
sure
it
had
been
a
spectre
and
she
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
curiosity
rather
than
fright
at
last
she
rose
and
unlocking
the
door
went
out
into
the
great
hall
by
the
light
of
her
lamp
she
looked
it
over
the
carved
bronze
doors
between
the
enormous
bronze
columns
were
so
elaborately
locked
and
bolted
as
to
give
almost
the
effect
of
a
fortress
the
windows
were
fastened
and
some
were
barred
but
all
these
details
had
been
looked
after
in
advance
eve
gazed
at
them
now
in
an
idle
quest
for
some
hint
of
hitherto
unsuspected
ingress
but
there
was
none
and
now
the
clock
was
striking
five
she
went
slowly
upstairs
unlocked
the
various
doors
without
opening
them
and
then
went
to
her
own
bedroom
what
about
it
cried
norma
eagerly
running
to
eve
room
a
big
story
eve
returned
wearily
but
i
tell
it
to
you
all
at
once
i
going
to
get
some
sleep
wake
me
at
eight
will
you
norma
disappointed
but
helpless
as
eve
closed
her
door
upon
the
visitor
norma
went
back
and
told
milly
who
was
waiting
and
listening
i
do
like
it
norma
said
for
by
eight
she
can
cook
up
a
story
to
scare
us
all
i
think
two
ought
to
sleep
in
that
room
at
once
go
to
bed
said
milly
sleepily
and
do
you
suspect
eve
carnforth
of
making
up
a
yarn
or
even
dressing
up
the
truth
she
is
that
sort
as
to
eve
veracity
opinions
were
divided
she
told
the
whole
story
directly
after
breakfast
to
the
whole
group
the
servants
being
well
out
of
earshot
she
told
it
simply
and
straightforwardly
just
as
it
had
happened
to
her
her
sincerity
and
accurate
statements
stood
a
fire
of
questions
a
volley
of
sarcastic
comments
and
a
few
assertions
of
unbelief
professor
hardwick
believed
implicitly
all
she
said
and
encouraged
her
to
dilate
upon
her
experiences
but
in
nowise
did
she
add
to
them
she
merely
repeated
or
emphasized
the
various
points
without
deviation
from
her
first
narrative
norma
and
braye
went
for
a
walk
and
frankly
discussed
it
of
course
eve
colours
it
without
meaning
to
declared
braye
it
could
have
happened
you
know
we
were
all
locked
in
and
lord
knows
none
of
us
could
have
put
that
stunt
over
even
if
we
had
wanted
to
of
course
not
that
locking
in
business
was
unnecessary
but
it
does
prove
that
no
human
agency
was
at
work
that
leaves
only
imagination
or
the
real
thing
it
was
the
real
thing
and
braye
shook
his
head
there
ai
no
such
animal
but
eve
imagination
is
no
braye
you
on
the
wrong
tack
eve
imagination
is
the
sort
that
conjures
up
phantoms
vernie
might
do
that
or
landon
but
not
miss
carnforth
she
is
psychic
i
know
because
i
am
myself
miss
cameron
norma
and
braye
became
suddenly
insistent
sleep
in
that
infernal
room
will
you
promise
me
you
wo
why
and
the
big
blue
eyes
looked
at
him
in
surprise
as
sentimental
tommy
used
to
say
would
fell
like
to
why
should
i
oh
i
do
want
you
to
and
braye
looked
really
distressed
promise
me
you
wo
please
why
do
you
care
i
be
carried
off
by
the
shawled
woman
ugh
and
braye
shivered
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
you
alone
down
there
i
beg
of
you
not
to
do
it
but
that
what
we
came
for
we
to
investigate
you
know
well
then
promise
you
wo
try
it
until
after
i
do
trickster
and
if
you
never
try
it
i
ca
you
see
through
me
too
well
but
at
least
promise
this
if
you
try
it
do
go
alone
say
you
and
miss
carnforth
go
together
hello
people
and
vernie
ran
round
a
corner
followed
more
slowly
by
tracy
we
had
a
great
little
old
climb
hundreds
of
thousands
of
feet
up
the
mounting
side
was
it
mr
tracy
thar
or
tharabouts
agreed
tracy
smiling
at
the
pretty
child
and
tracy
is
the
delightfullest
man
he
told
me
all
the
names
of
the
wild
flowers
weeds
rather
there
were
any
flowers
and
oh
it
exciting
about
eve
ghost
i
going
to
ballyrag
uncle
gif
till
he
lets
me
sleep
in
that
room
he
to
give
in
at
last
do
vernie
begged
braye
what
possesses
all
you
girls
i
wish
never
started
this
racket
but
you
must
do
it
kiddie
unless
that
is
you
go
with
somebody
else
but
not
alone
why
cousin
rudolph
what
are
you
afraid
of
are
you
a
mollycoddle
no
child
i
afraid
for
you
a
shock
like
that
even
an
imaginary
fright
might
upset
your
reason
and
my
reason
is
deeper
rooted
than
that
come
on
tracy
i
race
you
to
that
big
hemlock
tree
the
two
started
off
vernie
flying
legs
gaining
ground
at
first
over
tracy
steady
running
step
chapter
vi
at
four
the
game
grew
more
absorbing
most
of
the
party
managed
to
store
up
enough
courage
by
day
to
last
well
into
the
darker
and
more
mysterious
hours
it
was
at
four
in
the
morning
that
manifestations
were
oftenest
noticed
at
that
hour
vague
moanings
and
rustlings
were
reported
by
one
or
another
of
the
interested
investigators
but
no
human
agency
was
found
to
account
for
these
many
plans
were
tried
for
discovering
the
secret
of
the
room
with
the
tassels
but
all
scrutiny
failed
to
show
any
secret
panel
or
concealed
entrance
indeed
their
measurings
and
soundings
proved
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
entrance
to
that
room
save
the
door
from
the
hall
eve
and
norma
believed
thoroughly
in
the
actual
haunt
of
the
woman
who
had
poisoned
her
husband
they
had
no
difficulty
in
swallowing
whole
all
the
strange
noises
or
sights
and
attributing
them
to
supernatural
causes
not
so
gifford
bruce
he
still
held
that
it
was
all
trickery
cleverly
done
by
some
of
the
party
but
as
this
was
so
clearly
impossible
his
opinion
carried
no
weight
professor
hardwick
was
but
exceedingly
alert
of
observation
and
ready
to
suspect
anybody
who
would
give
him
the
slightest
reason
to
do
so
nobody
did
however
and
the
weird
sounds
continued
at
intervals
the
other
men
were
noncommittal
saying
they
had
yet
sufficient
data
to
base
conclusions
on
milly
was
nervous
and
hysterical
but
controlled
her
feelings
at
plea
and
awaited
developments
with
the
rest
vernie
was
merely
an
excited
child
gay
with
youthful
spirits
and
ready
to
believe
or
disbelieve
whatever
the
others
did
soon
after
eve
experience
which
no
one
unless
gifford
bruce
doubted
professor
hardwick
slept
in
the
haunted
room
he
had
no
results
of
interest
to
report
he
said
he
had
lain
awake
for
a
few
hours
and
then
fell
asleep
not
to
waken
until
daylight
if
the
shawled
woman
prowled
about
he
did
not
see
or
hear
her
this
was
disappointing
but
tracy
tried
with
little
better
success
in
the
morning
after
a
wakeful
but
uneventful
night
the
clergyman
found
the
old
battered
brass
candlestick
in
the
room
it
had
not
been
there
the
night
before
and
he
had
locked
the
door
as
the
others
had
done
this
was
inexplicable
but
of
slight
interest
compared
to
a
real
haunting
you
might
have
made
up
a
ghost
story
braye
reproached
him
as
uncle
gifford
did
and
as
miss
carnforth
did
the
last
word
was
distinctly
teasing
and
eve
frowned
gaily
at
him
but
did
not
defend
herself
she
knew
her
experience
had
occurred
just
as
she
had
told
it
and
deeply
mystified
she
was
earnestly
and
eagerly
awaiting
more
light
one
day
braye
found
it
necessary
to
go
down
to
new
york
for
a
couple
of
days
on
some
business
matters
before
leaving
he
made
vernie
promise
she
would
not
sleep
alone
in
the
haunted
room
while
he
was
gone
i
forbid
it
child
he
said
uncle
gif
is
so
that
i
no
doubt
you
could
wheedle
permission
out
of
him
but
i
beg
of
you
not
to
you
too
young
to
risk
a
nerve
shock
of
that
sort
if
you
want
to
try
it
with
miss
carnforth
or
miss
cameron
all
right
but
not
alone
promise
me
flapper
and
i
bring
you
a
pretty
present
from
town
day
after
vernie
laughingly
gave
the
required
promise
but
it
did
not
weigh
heavily
on
her
conscience
for
no
sooner
had
braye
really
gone
than
she
confided
to
tracy
her
indecision
regarding
the
keeping
of
her
word
of
course
you
keep
your
promise
and
tracy
regarded
her
seriously
nice
people
consider
a
spoken
word
inviolable
i
know
you
vernie
you
like
to
talk
at
random
but
i
think
you
an
honourable
nature
so
vernie
said
nothing
more
to
him
but
she
confided
in
eve
carnforth
her
intention
of
sleeping
in
the
tasseled
room
that
very
night
eve
did
not
discourage
her
and
promised
to
tell
no
one
the
plan
was
easily
carried
out
as
it
was
understood
no
one
was
sleeping
in
the
haunted
room
no
special
precautions
were
taken
save
the
usual
locking
up
against
outside
intruders
and
after
the
great
locks
and
bolts
were
fastened
on
doors
and
windows
it
would
have
been
a
clever
burglar
indeed
who
could
have
effected
an
entrance
to
black
aspens
the
evening
had
been
pleasantly
spent
some
trials
of
the
ouija
board
a
favourite
diversion
had
produced
no
interesting
results
and
rather
early
they
all
retired
at
midnight
vernie
softly
rose
and
went
downstairs
alone
in
the
darkness
a
night
lamp
in
the
upper
hall
gave
a
faint
glimmer
below
stairs
but
after
the
girl
turned
into
the
great
hall
the
dark
was
almost
impenetrable
feeling
her
way
she
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
softly
entered
it
and
walked
in
passing
her
hands
along
the
walls
and
the
familiar
furnishings
she
found
the
bed
and
lay
down
upon
it
her
heart
beat
fast
with
excitement
but
not
with
fear
she
felt
thrills
of
hope
that
the
ghost
would
appear
and
thrills
of
apprehension
lest
it
should
she
had
left
the
door
to
the
hall
open
and
though
it
could
scarcely
be
called
light
there
was
a
mitigation
of
the
darkness
near
the
door
a
not
unpleasant
drowsiness
overcame
her
and
she
half
slept
waking
every
time
the
clock
struck
in
the
hall
at
three
she
smiled
to
herself
realizing
that
she
was
there
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
and
felt
no
fear
i
hope
something
comes
at
four
she
thought
sleepily
and
closed
her
eyes
again
one
two
three
four
boomed
the
hall
clock
vernie
opened
her
eyes
only
half
conscious
and
yet
able
to
discern
a
strange
chill
in
the
air
between
her
and
the
open
door
stood
a
tall
gaunt
shape
merely
a
shadow
for
it
was
too
dark
to
discern
details
her
calm
forsook
her
she
shivered
violently
unable
to
control
her
muscles
her
teeth
chattered
her
knees
knocked
together
and
her
hair
seemed
to
rise
from
her
head
yet
she
could
make
no
sound
vainly
she
tried
to
scream
to
shriek
but
her
dry
throat
was
constricted
as
with
an
iron
band
her
eyes
burned
in
their
sockets
yet
she
was
powerless
to
shut
them
they
seemed
suddenly
to
possess
an
uncanny
ability
to
pierce
the
darkness
and
she
saw
the
shape
draw
slowly
nearer
to
her
clutching
the
bedclothing
she
tried
to
draw
it
over
her
head
but
her
paralyzed
arms
refused
to
move
nearer
slowly
nearer
the
thing
came
and
horror
reached
its
climax
at
sight
of
the
face
beneath
the
sheltering
shawl
it
was
the
face
of
a
skull
the
hollow
glared
at
her
and
lifting
a
deathlike
hand
with
long
white
fingers
the
spectre
told
off
one
two
three
four
on
the
digits
there
was
no
sound
but
a
final
pointing
of
the
fearsome
index
finger
at
the
stricken
girl
seemed
a
death
warrant
for
herself
the
thing
disappeared
slowly
silently
as
it
had
come
so
it
went
from
nowhere
to
nowhere
it
evolved
from
the
darkness
and
to
the
darkness
returned
vernie
did
faint
but
she
suffered
excruciatingly
her
head
was
on
fire
her
flesh
crept
and
quivered
she
was
bathed
in
a
cold
perspiration
and
her
heart
beat
madly
wildly
as
if
it
would
burst
the
vision
though
gone
remained
etched
on
her
brain
and
she
knew
that
until
that
faded
she
could
not
move
or
speak
it
seemed
to
her
hours
but
at
last
the
tension
lessened
a
little
the
first
move
was
agony
but
by
degrees
she
changed
her
position
a
trifle
and
moistened
her
dry
lips
with
the
first
faint
glimmer
of
dawn
she
dragged
herself
upstairs
and
crept
into
bed
beside
eve
carnforth
tell
me
begged
eve
and
vernie
told
her
it
was
a
warning
said
the
child
solemnly
it
means
i
shall
die
at
four
some
morning
nonsense
kiddie
now
you
come
through
so
bravely
and
have
such
an
experience
to
tell
do
spoil
it
all
by
such
croaking
but
it
true
eve
i
could
see
that
awful
thing
face
and
it
counted
four
and
then
beckoned
sort
of
shook
its
finger
you
know
and
pointed
at
me
and
oh
i
hardly
noticed
at
the
time
but
it
carried
a
glass
in
its
hand
it
seemed
to
have
two
glasses
oh
come
now
dearie
you
romancing
how
could
it
have
two
glasses
when
it
was
shaking
its
hand
at
you
but
it
did
eve
it
had
two
little
glasses
both
in
the
same
hand
i
remember
distinctly
oh
every
bit
of
it
is
printed
on
my
brain
forever
i
wish
i
had
done
it
rudolph
told
me
not
to
a
flood
of
tears
came
and
vernie
gave
way
to
great
racking
sobs
as
she
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
yes
he
was
right
too
vernie
but
you
know
he
only
wanted
you
not
to
try
it
because
he
feared
it
would
upset
your
nerves
now
if
you
going
to
square
yourself
with
braye
you
can
only
do
it
by
not
letting
your
nerves
be
upset
so
brace
up
and
control
them
cry
dear
cry
all
you
can
that
a
relief
and
will
do
you
a
heap
of
good
then
we
talk
it
over
and
by
breakfast
time
you
be
ready
to
tell
them
all
about
it
and
you
be
the
heroine
of
the
whole
crowd
it
wonderful
vernie
what
you
got
to
tell
and
you
must
be
careful
to
tell
it
truly
and
not
exaggerate
or
forget
anything
cry
away
honey
here
a
fresh
handkerchief
eve
calm
voice
and
manner
did
much
to
restore
nerves
and
as
she
looked
around
the
rational
familiar
room
bright
with
sunlight
her
spirits
revived
and
she
began
to
appreciate
her
rôle
of
heroine
her
story
was
received
with
grave
consideration
it
was
impossible
to
believe
the
honest
earnest
child
capable
of
falsehood
or
deceit
her
description
was
too
realistic
her
straightforward
narrative
too
unshakable
her
manner
too
impressively
true
to
be
doubted
in
the
least
degree
or
detail
gifford
bruce
laughed
and
complimented
her
on
her
pluck
tracy
reproved
her
for
breaking
her
word
to
her
cousin
but
as
he
was
in
no
way
responsible
for
vernie
behaviour
he
said
very
little
landon
scolded
her
roundly
while
milly
said
nothing
at
all
the
whole
affair
cast
rather
a
gloom
over
them
all
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
spectre
had
at
last
really
manifested
itself
in
earnest
an
undoubted
appearance
to
an
innocent
child
was
far
more
convincing
than
to
a
grown
person
of
avowed
psychic
tendencies
eve
carnforth
might
have
imagined
much
of
the
story
she
told
her
attention
might
have
exaggerated
the
facts
but
vernie
mind
was
like
a
page
of
white
paper
on
which
the
scene
she
passed
through
had
left
a
clear
imprint
that
night
vernie
herself
got
out
the
ouija
board
and
asked
eve
to
help
her
try
it
no
was
the
reply
i
too
broken
up
and
too
the
people
believe
get
your
uncle
or
tracy
or
some
truthful
and
honourable
person
to
help
you
it
embittered
eve
that
her
earnestness
and
her
implicit
belief
in
the
supernatural
made
it
more
difficult
for
the
others
to
look
upon
her
as
entirely
disingenuous
she
resented
this
and
was
a
little
morose
in
consequence
norma
cameron
herself
an
avowed
had
had
no
spiritistic
visitant
in
the
haunted
room
and
eve
thought
norma
had
doubted
her
word
at
last
after
trying
all
the
others
that
she
wanted
vernie
persuaded
tracy
to
move
ouija
with
her
and
the
two
sat
down
with
the
board
between
them
few
and
flippant
messages
were
forthcoming
until
just
as
vernie
had
laughingly
declared
she
would
throw
the
old
thing
out
of
the
window
a
startling
sentence
formed
itself
from
the
erratic
dartings
of
the
toy
and
vernie
turned
pale
stop
it
ordered
tracy
i
refuse
to
touch
it
again
he
removed
his
hands
and
sat
back
but
vernie
glaring
at
the
letters
held
it
a
moment
longer
it
says
she
cried
oh
eve
i
told
you
so
what
vernie
what
is
it
dear
and
eve
carnforth
came
over
to
the
excited
child
ouija
eve
ouija
said
that
at
four
two
of
us
are
to
die
oh
eve
you
know
every
death
in
this
house
has
occurred
at
four
in
the
morning
stebbins
said
so
and
now
two
of
us
are
to
die
nonsense
cried
tracy
do
listen
to
that
rubbish
the
ouija
ran
off
its
track
maybe
vernie
pushed
it
maybe
i
did
now
tracy
i
push
it
and
you
need
try
to
make
anybody
think
did
you
never
push
it
to
say
a
thing
like
that
why
it
spelled
it
all
out
as
plain
as
day
uncle
gifford
do
you
hear
two
of
us
to
die
vernie
voice
rose
to
a
hysterical
shriek
hush
vernie
hush
child
i
take
you
away
from
here
we
ought
never
to
have
brought
you
and
gifford
bruce
glowered
at
the
others
as
he
clasped
the
sobbing
child
in
his
arms
and
took
her
from
the
room
you
right
agreed
tracy
and
braye
was
right
he
said
a
fright
or
shock
would
upset
that
child
nerves
completely
but
she
must
have
pushed
the
board
herself
it
flew
round
like
lightning
and
spelled
out
the
message
just
as
she
said
i
tried
to
steer
it
off
but
she
urged
against
me
i
felt
her
doing
so
i
do
mean
she
made
up
the
message
to
create
a
sensation
but
i
think
the
ghost
last
night
affected
her
as
a
warning
and
her
mind
is
so
full
of
it
that
she
unconsciously
or
subconsciously
worked
up
that
at
any
rate
i
had
about
enough
of
this
if
she
to
be
here
it
is
right
to
frighten
a
child
so
and
vernie
is
little
more
than
a
child
that
so
said
norma
thoughtfully
i
had
enough
too
if
the
rest
of
you
want
to
stay
on
i
go
down
to
new
york
and
take
vernie
to
stay
with
me
for
a
while
we
go
to
the
seashore
and
see
to
it
that
she
has
no
psychic
or
supernatural
experiences
why
norma
and
eve
looked
surprised
i
thought
you
were
so
interested
in
these
things
so
i
am
but
not
to
the
extent
of
so
affecting
the
nervous
system
of
a
sweet
innocent
child
that
it
may
result
in
permanent
injury
she
all
right
said
gifford
bruce
returning
alone
it
hysteria
i
think
i
take
her
back
to
town
or
next
day
something
uncanny
up
here
that
certain
i
did
take
any
stock
in
the
experiences
of
you
people
but
i
ca
disbelieve
vernie
story
the
party
broke
up
and
all
went
to
their
rooms
there
was
no
volunteer
to
sleep
in
the
haunted
room
that
night
and
every
one
felt
a
shivering
dread
of
what
might
happen
at
four
the
next
morning
not
one
admitted
it
but
every
one
secretly
shuddered
at
thought
of
ouija
message
and
when
as
the
hall
clock
rung
out
its
four
strokes
the
next
morning
and
nothing
untoward
happened
every
one
drew
a
long
breath
and
soon
went
to
sleep
again
relieved
as
of
a
heavy
burden
gaily
they
gathered
at
breakfast
daylight
and
good
cheer
reviving
their
spirits
but
ouija
is
henceforth
taboo
said
tracy
shaking
his
finger
at
the
now
laughing
vernie
for
little
girls
anyway
supplemented
eve
little
girls
are
taboo
also
declared
gifford
bruce
i
ca
get
off
for
i
want
to
see
rudolph
on
his
return
but
i
pack
up
my
vernie
child
and
take
her
back
to
our
own
little
old
chicago
on
the
lake
these
aspens
are
too
black
for
us
now
uncle
i
do
want
to
go
and
vernie
pouted
prettily
and
sumpum
tells
me
i
wo
go
she
added
with
a
roguish
glance
at
her
uncle
whom
she
usually
twisted
round
her
rosy
little
finger
but
he
gave
her
a
grave
smile
in
return
and
the
subject
was
dropped
for
the
moment
soon
after
noon
braye
came
up
from
the
city
and
listened
frowning
to
the
tales
that
were
told
him
you
promised
me
vernie
he
said
reproachfully
i
know
it
cousin
rudolph
but
you
see
i
never
kept
a
promise
in
my
whole
life
and
i
did
want
to
break
my
record
naughty
flapper
i
wo
give
you
the
present
i
brought
for
you
oh
yes
you
will
and
so
wheedlesome
was
the
lovely
face
and
so
persuasive
the
soft
voice
that
vernie
after
a
short
argument
seized
upon
a
small
jeweller
packet
and
unwrapped
a
pretty
little
ring
angel
cousin
she
observed
you
just
about
the
nicest
cousin
i
possess
beside
being
the
only
one
doubtful
compliment
laughed
braye
any
way
you
the
prettiest
and
naughtiest
cousin
own
as
a
punishment
for
your
disobedience
i
challenge
you
to
a
round
with
old
ouija
i
bet
i
can
make
it
say
something
more
cheerful
than
you
wormed
out
of
it
last
evening
all
right
we
try
it
and
vernie
danced
gaily
away
to
tease
her
uncle
not
to
take
her
home
a
little
later
milly
as
housekeeper
discovered
some
serious
shortage
in
the
commissariat
department
and
braye
offered
to
drive
her
over
to
east
dryden
marketing
they
started
off
milly
calling
back
to
eve
to
preside
at
the
if
she
did
return
in
time
all
right
agreed
eve
though
vernie
vociferously
announced
her
intention
of
playing
hostess
in
milly
absence
the
shoppers
had
not
returned
when
old
thorpe
brought
in
the
you
can
pour
eve
and
i
pass
the
cakies
said
vernie
who
was
in
high
spirits
for
she
had
partially
persuaded
her
uncle
to
remain
longer
at
black
aspens
he
was
just
phrasing
certain
strong
stipulations
on
which
his
permission
was
to
be
based
when
the
tea
things
arrived
they
were
as
usual
in
the
hall
for
though
they
sometimes
suggested
the
plan
of
having
tea
out
of
doors
there
was
no
cheerful
terrace
or
pleasant
porch
the
hall
though
sombre
and
vast
had
become
more
or
less
homelike
by
virtue
of
usage
so
there
they
took
their
tea
tracy
always
graceful
in
social
matters
helped
pass
the
cups
and
plates
for
no
one
liked
to
have
the
old
thorpes
about
unnecessarily
no
tea
for
me
please
declared
norma
i
think
it
upsets
my
nerves
and
that
is
not
the
thing
to
do
in
house
laughed
landon
this
is
mighty
good
tea
though
did
know
anybody
could
brew
it
as
well
as
milly
congratulations
eve
thank
you
and
eve
long
lashes
swept
upward
as
she
gave
him
a
coquettish
glance
referring
to
that
matter
of
which
we
were
talking
hardwick
gifford
bruce
began
i
even
as
he
spoke
the
clock
chimed
four
and
as
always
they
paused
to
count
the
long
slow
strokes
then
bruce
began
again
i
think
myself
a
strange
change
passed
over
his
face
his
jaw
fell
his
eyes
stared
and
then
his
teacup
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
slumped
down
in
an
awful
a
terrifying
heap
landon
sprang
to
his
assistance
norma
ran
to
him
while
tracy
with
a
quick
glance
at
vernie
flew
to
the
child
side
what
is
it
he
cried
to
her
what
the
matter
vernie
he
slipped
an
arm
round
her
just
as
with
a
wild
look
and
a
ringing
shriek
the
head
fell
back
and
her
eyes
closed
oh
cried
eve
has
happened
i
do
know
and
tracy
voice
shook
help
me
miss
carnforth
let
us
lay
her
on
this
sofa
between
them
they
carried
the
girl
for
she
was
past
muscular
effort
and
as
they
placed
her
gently
on
the
sofa
her
eyes
fluttered
she
gave
a
gasping
sigh
and
fell
back
inert
oh
cried
eve
she
is
she
it
just
four
landon
ran
to
vernie
side
and
felt
of
her
heart
she
is
dead
he
said
solemnly
his
face
white
his
voice
shaking
and
gifford
bruce
is
dead
too
it
is
four
chapter
vii
the
mystery
in
the
moments
that
followed
the
realization
of
the
double
tragedy
the
natural
characteristics
of
all
those
present
showed
themselves
eve
carnforth
strong
and
calm
suddenly
became
dictator
lay
bruce
flat
on
his
back
she
called
out
as
she
darted
upstairs
for
her
room
and
returned
with
smelling
salts
ammonia
and
such
things
tracy
also
capable
and
took
a
vial
from
her
and
held
it
before
the
face
of
the
stricken
child
while
others
strove
to
bring
back
to
consciousness
the
motionless
figure
of
gifford
bruce
now
stretched
on
the
floor
it
no
use
declared
landon
flinging
the
beads
of
sweat
from
his
forehead
they
are
dead
both
of
them
oh
what
it
mean
norma
sat
in
a
big
chair
her
hands
clutching
its
carved
arms
and
her
face
stony
white
she
was
using
all
her
will
power
to
keep
from
utter
collapse
and
she
could
understand
how
eve
could
be
so
natural
and
brace
up
norma
eve
admonished
her
here
take
this
now
is
no
time
to
make
more
trouble
the
brusque
words
had
the
effect
of
rousing
norma
and
she
forced
herself
to
rise
what
can
i
do
she
whispered
do
cried
eve
there
everything
to
do
some
one
telephone
for
a
doctor
i
ca
norma
moaned
you
do
that
professor
wo
you
oh
i
ca
and
hardwick
fell
limply
into
a
chair
i
i
all
upset
of
course
you
are
professor
said
tracy
kindly
i
telephone
miss
carnforth
do
you
know
the
village
doctor
name
of
course
it
too
late
he
glanced
at
the
two
still
forms
but
a
physician
must
be
summoned
no
i
do
know
any
name
call
thorpe
or
hester
tracy
rang
a
bell
and
thorpe
came
shuffling
in
at
sight
of
the
tragedy
he
turned
and
ran
screaming
hester
came
and
proved
the
more
useful
of
the
two
her
stolidity
was
helpful
and
she
told
the
doctor
name
and
number
dead
ai
they
she
said
with
a
grieved
intonation
that
robbed
her
words
of
curtness
what
happened
to
the
simple
question
roused
them
all
what
had
happened
what
had
killed
two
strong
well
people
at
the
same
moment
and
that
the
very
moment
said
to
be
fatal
in
that
dread
house
i
believe
said
the
professor
dropping
his
face
in
his
hands
i
believe
now
in
the
supernatural
nothing
else
can
explain
this
thing
of
course
not
and
eve
solemnly
acquiesced
there
is
no
possibility
of
anything
else
what
could
kill
them
like
this
at
once
and
at
four
exactly
except
a
supernormal
agent
but
that
seems
so
impossible
and
tracy
practical
voice
did
indeed
make
it
seem
so
what
else
possible
broke
in
landon
it
is
suicide
it
murder
it
is
death
from
natural
causes
at
least
it
ca
be
in
vernie
case
i
suppose
bruce
might
have
died
from
heart
disease
that
why
we
want
a
doctor
said
eve
we
can
judge
nothing
until
we
know
the
immediate
cause
of
death
i
wish
we
were
in
the
city
tracy
said
the
doctor
will
be
nearly
an
hour
getting
here
i
suppose
did
you
tell
him
all
asked
eve
no
i
did
it
did
seem
wise
to
spread
the
news
in
that
way
i
told
him
to
get
here
as
soon
as
he
possibly
could
that
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
which
it
certainly
is
murmured
norma
oh
eve
what
do
you
really
think
eve
carnforth
looked
at
the
other
girl
eve
so
poised
and
collected
strength
and
will
power
written
in
every
line
of
her
face
norma
so
fragile
and
shaken
by
the
awful
scenes
about
her
i
do
know
what
to
think
eve
replied
slowly
there
only
one
thing
certain
vernie
received
a
warning
of
death
and
vernie
is
dead
bruce
received
no
definite
warning
that
i
know
of
but
he
may
have
had
one
you
know
he
said
he
was
visited
by
the
phantom
but
we
believe
him
that
so
and
tracy
looked
up
in
surprise
we
never
quite
believed
bruce
statements
because
he
scorned
all
talk
of
spirit
manifestations
if
he
really
did
see
the
ghost
that
night
that
he
said
he
did
of
course
he
did
declared
eve
believed
him
all
the
time
i
can
always
tell
when
any
one
is
speaking
the
truth
it
part
of
my
sensitive
nature
wynne
landon
stalked
about
the
hall
like
a
man
in
torment
what
shall
i
do
with
milly
he
groaned
she
and
braye
will
be
back
soon
any
minute
now
she
must
see
these
they
ought
to
be
placed
in
some
other
room
said
eve
gently
one
must
touch
a
dead
body
before
began
professor
hardwick
but
tracy
interrupted
him
that
in
case
of
murder
professor
he
said
this
is
a
different
matter
whatever
caused
these
deaths
it
was
by
the
hand
of
another
human
being
if
it
was
fright
or
nervous
apprehension
those
are
to
be
classed
among
natural
causes
i
think
we
are
wholly
justified
in
moving
the
bodies
after
some
discussion
landon
and
the
professor
agreed
with
tracy
and
with
the
help
of
thorpe
and
hester
the
stricken
forms
were
carried
out
of
the
hall
where
the
group
so
often
forgathered
it
is
better
said
eve
for
we
need
this
hall
continually
and
if
we
do
move
them
at
once
the
doctor
may
forbid
it
when
he
comes
by
common
consent
the
body
of
gifford
bruce
was
laid
in
the
drawing
room
on
a
large
sofa
and
vernie
slender
figure
was
reverently
placed
on
the
bed
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
no
spirit
shape
can
frighten
her
now
said
norma
weeping
bitterly
as
thorpe
and
hester
carried
the
dead
girl
in
then
both
doors
were
closed
shutting
off
the
silent
figures
and
those
who
were
left
felt
a
vague
sense
of
relief
now
we
can
break
it
to
milly
more
gently
said
eve
clear
away
that
broken
cup
hester
and
make
some
fresh
tea
i
sure
we
all
need
it
on
the
great
rug
the
damp
spot
remained
where
the
spilled
tea
had
fallen
and
eve
ordered
a
smaller
rug
placed
over
it
braye
and
milly
came
in
laughing
we
bought
out
the
whole
of
east
dryden
milly
exclaimed
and
what
do
you
think
we
found
some
fresh
lobsters
still
alive
and
kicking
and
we
commandeered
them
at
once
what
the
matter
with
you
people
you
look
solemn
as
owls
come
up
to
your
room
milly
to
take
off
your
wraps
and
landon
took
her
arm
to
lead
her
away
nonsense
wynne
i
throw
them
off
down
here
i
thirsty
for
tea
no
come
on
dear
come
with
me
awed
at
his
tone
milly
went
with
him
and
they
disappeared
up
the
staircase
then
professor
hardwick
told
braye
what
had
happened
the
others
had
begged
the
professor
to
do
this
and
in
a
very
few
words
the
tale
was
told
it
ca
be
and
braye
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
hall
i
wish
i
had
been
here
oh
forgive
me
all
of
you
i
know
you
did
all
you
could
but
restoratives
we
did
said
eve
i
ran
for
sal
volatile
and
such
things
but
you
do
understand
it
was
instantaneous
was
it
mr
tracy
it
was
replied
tracy
gravely
bruce
was
speaking
naturally
and
normally
he
paused
when
the
clock
struck
we
always
do
you
know
it
a
sort
of
habit
we
have
to
really
said
norma
that
clock
strikes
so
loudly
one
ca
go
on
talking
and
then
began
the
professor
he
was
talking
to
me
you
know
and
i
was
looking
straight
at
him
his
face
changed
in
an
instant
his
fingers
spread
as
if
galvanized
his
teacup
fell
from
his
hand
and
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
yes
dead
in
a
second
i
should
say
and
vernie
braye
spoke
with
difficulty
i
chanced
to
be
looking
at
vernie
said
tracy
the
outcry
concerning
bruce
made
us
all
look
toward
him
and
then
a
sudden
sound
from
vernie
drew
my
attention
to
her
she
gasped
and
her
face
looked
queer
sort
of
drawn
and
gray
so
i
sprang
to
her
side
and
held
her
up
lest
she
fall
she
was
standing
looking
at
bruce
of
course
i
felt
her
sway
her
head
fell
back
and
then
miss
carnforth
came
to
my
assistance
and
we
laid
her
quickly
down
on
the
sofa
in
an
instant
the
child
was
dead
it
is
incredible
that
it
should
have
been
a
case
of
sudden
fright
that
proved
fatal
and
yet
what
other
theory
is
there
it
could
be
heart
disease
in
a
child
of
sixteen
no
mused
braye
and
yet
what
could
it
have
been
i
wo
subscribe
to
any
supernatural
theory
now
it
too
absurd
it
the
only
thing
that
is
absurd
contradicted
eve
remember
rudolph
vernie
had
the
warning
warning
be
hanged
cried
braye
explosively
but
think
went
on
eve
gently
the
phantom
told
vernie
she
would
die
at
four
four
in
the
morning
vernie
said
if
i
had
thought
of
four
in
the
afternoon
i
would
have
gone
out
nobody
knows
that
the
message
said
four
in
the
morning
vernie
told
me
about
it
many
times
and
she
only
said
you
know
the
phantom
spoke
no
word
it
merely
designated
by
its
fingers
one
two
three
four
also
vernie
said
it
carried
two
glasses
of
poison
but
were
poisoned
no
that
was
merely
the
symbol
of
death
also
rudolph
remember
the
ouija
board
said
two
would
die
at
four
you
ca
get
away
from
these
things
that
confounded
ouija
performance
was
on
one
of
the
nights
i
was
in
new
york
i
wish
i
had
gone
but
vernie
promised
me
she
would
sleep
in
that
room
i
was
a
fool
to
believe
her
you
see
eve
i
feel
a
sort
of
responsibility
for
the
child
uncle
gif
was
so
and
indulgent
he
was
no
sort
of
a
guardian
for
her
now
she
was
growing
up
i
planned
to
have
her
put
under
the
care
of
some
right
kind
of
a
woman
this
fall
and
brought
up
properly
i
know
it
rudolph
you
were
very
fond
of
her
not
only
that
but
i
appreciated
what
she
needed
and
i
meant
to
see
that
she
got
it
oh
eve
i
ca
realize
this
thing
doctor
wayburn
came
in
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
the
man
was
scared
in
his
years
of
country
practice
he
had
never
run
up
against
anything
tragic
or
thrilling
before
and
he
was
overwhelmed
with
trembling
step
he
entered
the
room
of
death
and
first
made
examination
of
the
body
of
gifford
bruce
it
did
not
take
long
there
was
no
apparent
cause
for
death
no
symptoms
were
present
of
any
fatal
disease
nor
so
far
as
he
could
see
of
any
poison
or
wound
of
any
sort
i
can
not
say
what
an
autopsy
may
divulge
declared
the
frightened
practitioner
but
from
this
superficial
examination
i
find
no
cause
of
dissolution
then
he
crossed
the
hall
to
the
room
with
the
tassels
braye
followed
him
in
eve
also
the
professor
and
tracy
stood
in
the
doorway
but
norma
remained
in
the
hall
her
face
buried
in
some
sofa
cushions
no
apparent
cause
the
doctor
repeated
this
child
was
in
perfect
health
i
should
say
fright
have
killed
her
but
it
does
seem
credible
i
know
of
no
cause
of
any
sort
that
could
bring
about
death
in
an
instant
of
time
as
you
report
maybe
not
an
instant
corrected
the
professor
carefully
as
i
look
back
i
should
judge
there
was
at
least
a
half
a
minute
between
bruce
first
symptom
of
unease
and
his
falling
to
the
floor
so
with
vernie
said
eve
thoughtfully
i
saw
tracy
go
quickly
toward
her
i
followed
immediately
and
i
sure
there
was
nearly
a
half
minute
but
not
more
before
she
gasped
and
died
it
hard
to
judge
time
on
such
occasions
said
the
doctor
looking
sharply
at
eve
i
know
it
but
i
was
very
conscious
of
it
all
almost
clairvoyantly
so
and
i
can
assure
you
it
was
not
longer
than
a
half
minute
in
either
case
between
the
state
of
usual
health
and
death
itself
is
there
any
cause
or
agent
that
will
work
as
quickly
as
that
i
know
of
none
replied
doctor
wayburn
positively
there
is
none
eve
assured
him
these
deaths
were
caused
by
supernatural
means
they
were
the
vengeance
of
certain
powers
of
darkness
oh
come
now
eve
expostulated
braye
do
get
off
that
stuff
to
the
doctor
keep
that
for
our
own
circle
you
know
these
fatalities
have
been
caused
by
a
ghost
what
then
i
do
know
fright
perhaps
or
because
of
the
warnings
if
you
like
and
so
indirectly
the
result
of
the
spooks
but
not
the
direct
work
of
a
disembodied
spirit
it
all
the
same
and
eve
left
the
room
and
went
to
sit
by
norma
but
the
girls
were
not
in
sympathy
their
conversation
resulted
in
disagreement
and
at
last
in
norma
bursting
into
tears
and
running
upstairs
she
sought
milly
and
found
her
prostrated
by
landon
news
but
she
was
trying
to
be
brave
and
earnestly
endeavouring
to
preserve
her
i
know
every
one
thinks
i
go
to
pieces
she
said
pathetically
and
make
more
trouble
for
you
all
but
i
wo
i
promised
wynne
i
be
brave
and
if
i
ca
keep
quiet
and
composed
i
stay
in
my
room
and
not
upset
the
crowd
you
all
right
milly
norma
reassured
her
you
let
yourself
go
all
you
want
to
do
overdo
your
restraint
i
look
after
you
yes
do
norma
do
let
eve
come
near
me
i
ca
stand
her
why
you
must
be
unjust
to
eve
she
behaved
splendidly
at
that
awful
time
yes
i
know
but
if
it
had
been
for
eve
we
never
would
have
come
up
here
at
all
oh
milly
that
is
fair
we
all
agreed
to
come
here
it
was
doing
any
more
than
mine
yes
it
was
but
look
here
norma
tell
me
truly
what
do
think
killed
bruce
and
vernie
i
do
know
milly
dear
you
know
i
do
believe
in
psychics
and
in
spiritism
and
in
the
return
to
earth
of
the
souls
of
people
who
have
died
but
i
believe
that
any
such
spirit
would
kill
an
innocent
child
or
a
fine
old
man
i
ca
it
but
why
not
norma
if
you
believe
in
the
return
to
earth
of
good
spirits
why
not
bad
spirits
as
well
and
if
so
why
could
they
kill
people
if
they
want
to
you
sound
logical
milly
but
it
absurd
no
it
is
you
and
eve
believe
in
good
spirits
and
in
their
power
to
do
good
why
not
then
in
bad
spirits
and
their
power
to
do
evil
let
up
milly
begged
landon
who
stood
near
by
she
been
going
on
like
that
norma
ever
since
i
told
her
ca
you
explain
to
her
explain
what
lord
do
know
but
make
her
see
how
impossible
it
is
that
the
ghost
of
that
woman
who
killed
her
husband
here
so
long
ago
should
have
any
reason
to
do
away
with
two
modern
people
but
i
to
think
so
wynne
and
milly
eyes
stared
with
a
peculiar
light
i
rather
think
they
were
killed
by
that
ghost
than
by
a
person
would
you
what
do
you
mean
milly
murdered
yes
eve
that
what
it
must
have
been
if
not
spirits
they
had
no
mortal
disease
either
of
them
do
mention
that
before
any
one
else
admonished
eve
very
seriously
there
are
other
explanations
milly
many
deaths
have
been
brought
about
by
sudden
fright
or
by
continuous
apprehension
of
imaginary
danger
vernie
had
been
warned
twice
true
i
did
think
of
four
in
the
afternoon
but
doubtless
she
did
and
maybe
seeing
the
sudden
attack
of
bruce
so
startled
her
that
she
thought
of
the
four
doom
and
gave
way
herself
she
might
give
way
to
the
extent
of
fainting
or
a
fit
of
hysterics
admitted
milly
but
not
to
the
extent
of
dropping
dead
unthinkable
it
unbelievable
it
almost
unbelievable
that
they
should
dead
eve
said
softly
but
as
to
how
they
died
let
not
speculate
dear
i
suppose
we
must
have
a
doctor
up
from
new
york
what
do
you
think
mr
landon
eh
oh
i
do
know
i
sure
i
do
know
but
you
have
to
take
charge
wo
you
asked
eve
you
two
are
really
the
heads
of
this
house
all
i
want
is
to
get
away
moaned
milly
when
can
we
go
wynne
i
do
know
dear
say
eve
wo
you
take
milly
down
i
ca
leave
of
course
but
i
dare
keep
her
here
lest
she
go
to
pieces
you
take
her
home
there
a
train
in
about
an
hour
oh
i
ca
i
want
to
stay
here
send
norma
no
she
no
good
perhaps
tracy
will
take
milly
down
he
awfully
kind
and
ready
to
do
anything
as
milly
declared
herself
now
willing
the
three
went
downstairs
they
found
the
others
in
the
hall
the
doctor
still
there
and
the
tea
things
still
about
eve
gave
milly
some
tea
and
took
some
herself
i
have
to
call
in
the
coroner
doctor
wayburn
was
saying
it
apparently
a
murder
and
yet
it
a
mysterious
death
they
both
are
yes
the
county
physician
must
be
summoned
the
doctor
had
gotten
over
the
first
panic
of
surprise
and
began
to
feel
a
sense
of
importance
such
a
case
had
never
come
near
him
before
and
the
whole
affair
gave
him
a
pleasant
feeling
of
responsibility
and
foreshadowed
his
prominence
in
the
public
eye
the
suggestion
of
a
coroner
was
resented
by
all
who
listened
but
the
doctor
word
was
law
in
the
case
so
they
unwillingly
consented
i
think
i
better
go
down
to
new
york
said
braye
there
are
so
many
things
to
see
to
so
many
people
to
notify
the
reporters
to
look
after
and
undertaking
arrangements
to
be
made
unless
you
want
to
go
wynne
no
said
landon
it
better
for
you
rudolph
but
i
wish
you
take
milly
take
her
to
her
mother
and
let
her
get
out
of
this
atmosphere
will
you
go
milly
i
did
want
to
wynne
when
i
was
upstairs
but
now
with
people
all
about
if
norma
will
stay
here
too
i
rather
stay
with
you
when
are
going
down
wynne
i
do
know
dear
we
have
to
see
how
things
turn
out
well
you
go
ahead
rudolph
you
have
to
hustle
to
get
over
to
the
train
and
there
are
a
few
matters
i
wish
you
look
after
for
me
the
two
men
went
off
to
discuss
these
matters
and
then
doctor
wayburn
who
had
been
telephoning
announced
that
the
coroner
could
not
come
until
the
next
day
as
he
was
in
another
township
attending
to
some
duties
and
i
glad
of
it
said
eve
for
we
had
enough
excitement
for
one
day
and
so
by
ten
or
eleven
the
house
was
locked
up
and
the
members
of
the
household
gone
to
bed
all
except
old
thorpe
who
sat
in
the
great
hall
with
the
two
doors
open
into
the
rooms
where
the
still
tragic
figures
lay
before
him
on
a
table
hester
had
placed
coffee
and
sandwiches
and
the
old
man
sat
brooding
on
the
awful
events
of
the
afternoon
chapter
viii
by
what
means
the
night
was
full
of
restlessness
tracy
and
professor
hardwick
in
their
adjoining
rooms
were
the
only
ones
in
the
wing
that
had
the
night
before
also
housed
braye
and
gifford
bruce
shall
we
leave
the
door
between
open
tracy
asked
more
out
of
consideration
for
the
professor
nerves
than
his
own
yes
if
you
will
and
do
go
to
bed
yet
i
ca
sleep
i
know
and
i
must
discuss
this
thing
with
somebody
or
go
mad
all
right
sir
and
tracy
took
off
his
coat
and
donned
an
hardwick
smiled
that
the
first
ministerial
garb
i
seen
you
wear
he
said
i
pick
that
up
for
a
dominie
negligé
every
time
i
rather
attached
to
the
old
dud
and
tracy
patted
it
affectionately
queer
how
one
comes
to
love
a
worn
garment
no
i
do
wear
clerical
togs
when
off
on
a
vacation
i
used
to
till
some
one
told
me
it
cast
a
restraint
over
the
others
and
i
hate
to
feel
i
doing
that
you
never
do
that
my
friend
you
a
natural
tact
that
ought
to
carry
you
far
toward
general
popularity
but
tell
me
as
man
to
man
how
do
you
size
up
this
awful
mystery
i
do
know
professor
at
times
my
mind
a
blank
and
then
i
get
a
hint
or
well
i
ca
call
it
a
suspicion
but
a
thought
say
in
one
direction
and
it
so
fearfully
absurd
i
discard
it
at
once
then
comes
another
idea
only
to
be
dismissed
like
the
first
what
do
you
think
i
am
a
complete
convert
to
the
supernatural
you
know
sir
oliver
lodge
and
many
other
scientists
only
believed
after
they
had
had
undeniable
personal
experience
now
here
were
warnings
definite
positive
prophecies
and
they
were
fulfilled
what
more
can
any
one
ask
tracy
mused
over
this
i
know
that
he
said
at
last
but
i
quite
swallow
it
whole
like
that
do
you
mean
there
was
no
physical
cause
such
as
fright
expectant
attention
expectant
attention
is
a
fine
phrase
much
like
they
are
all
right
as
far
as
they
go
but
they
ca
go
to
the
extent
of
killing
people
then
again
suggest
even
a
theory
even
a
possible
means
of
the
death
of
those
two
by
any
human
agency
murder
is
out
of
the
question
suicide
even
more
so
and
they
had
no
desire
to
end
their
lives
a
young
girl
happily
looking
forward
to
gaiety
and
pleasure
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
hale
rich
prosperous
no
they
had
no
wish
to
die
true
enough
but
i
ca
quite
see
it
why
did
the
spirits
want
to
kill
them
if
spirits
did
kill
them
for
interfering
with
this
haunted
house
in
a
frivolous
and
flippant
way
i
always
heard
that
departed
souls
bitterly
resent
scoffing
or
merely
curious
investigation
but
why
choose
those
two
or
vernie
anyway
perhaps
bruce
was
needlessly
sarcastic
and
sceptical
so
was
the
child
oh
but
in
such
an
innocent
harmless
way
however
professor
nothing
to
offer
in
place
of
your
argument
my
creed
does
not
admit
of
my
subscribing
to
your
theory
but
i
confess
i
unable
to
suggest
any
other
as
you
say
it
could
have
been
suicide
and
there
no
possibility
of
foul
play
the
two
men
talked
on
or
sat
in
silent
thought
far
into
the
night
the
clock
struck
twelve
before
they
at
last
retired
leaving
open
their
communication
door
and
securely
locking
their
hall
doors
less
than
an
hour
later
a
slender
figure
tiptoed
from
one
of
the
bedrooms
and
looked
over
the
banisters
peering
down
through
the
darkness
the
dim
outline
of
old
thorpe
form
was
visible
he
was
huddled
in
his
chair
his
head
fallen
forward
on
the
table
softly
returning
to
her
room
for
a
wrap
eve
again
stealthily
came
to
the
staircase
and
sat
down
on
the
uppermost
step
later
still
another
door
silently
opened
and
a
pair
of
surprised
blue
eyes
saw
eve
sitting
there
suppressing
a
startled
exclamation
norma
scurried
back
to
her
room
but
eve
did
not
hear
her
milly
was
wakeful
and
restless
several
times
she
declared
she
heard
sounds
but
when
wynne
wanted
to
go
and
investigate
she
refused
to
let
him
do
so
the
house
surely
seemed
haunted
the
aspens
brushed
against
the
windows
with
their
eternal
soughing
their
leaves
whispering
hissing
creepy
secrets
and
their
branches
tapping
eerily
on
the
panes
the
halls
were
full
of
shadows
vague
indistinct
fading
to
nothingness
at
four
the
great
clock
tolled
the
hour
and
every
one
in
the
house
heard
it
no
one
was
asleep
every
heart
was
beating
fast
every
eye
wide
open
every
nerve
tense
but
nothing
happened
no
shriek
rent
the
silence
no
unusual
or
terrifying
sound
was
heard
relieved
some
went
to
sleep
again
some
tossed
restlessly
on
their
pillows
until
rising
time
at
breakfast
all
looked
haggard
and
worn
the
day
was
cool
and
pleasant
the
dining
room
bright
with
sunshine
and
old
hester
viands
most
appetizing
thorpe
had
closed
the
doors
of
the
rooms
given
over
to
the
presence
of
death
and
as
the
various
members
of
the
party
came
down
the
staircase
quick
apprehensive
glances
were
followed
by
a
look
of
relief
elijah
stebbins
came
while
breakfast
was
in
progress
and
at
invitation
took
a
seat
at
the
board
well
he
said
heavily
you
folks
wanted
spooks
i
hope
satisfied
do
use
that
tone
stebbins
landon
reproved
him
a
dreadful
thing
has
happened
i
can
not
think
it
is
by
supernatural
causes
nor
can
i
see
any
other
explanation
but
that
is
no
reason
for
you
to
speak
flippantly
of
our
investigations
of
your
haunted
house
no
offence
meant
and
stebbins
cringed
but
i
thinkin
you
folks
had
better
go
away
from
here
or
there
no
tellin
what
might
happen
do
you
know
anything
about
the
mystery
professor
hardwick
shot
out
the
question
so
suddenly
that
stebbins
jumped
no
sir
of
course
i
do
sir
how
could
i
then
why
do
you
warn
us
off
the
premises
i
do
exactly
do
that
but
i
think
you
reason
for
yourselves
that
what
happens
once
can
happen
the
dogged
look
on
the
man
face
seemed
portentous
of
evil
and
milly
began
to
cry
oh
take
me
home
wynne
she
begged
i
do
want
to
stay
here
come
with
me
milly
said
eve
and
rising
she
led
milly
from
the
room
it
was
shortly
after
that
the
coroner
arrived
i
do
want
to
see
that
man
said
stebbins
him
and
me
ai
good
friends
and
rising
quickly
the
owner
of
the
house
fled
toward
the
kitchen
quarters
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
with
the
thorpes
out
there
doctor
crawford
the
county
physician
and
coroner
was
a
man
of
slow
speech
and
dignified
manner
he
was
appalled
by
the
circumstances
in
which
he
found
himself
and
a
little
frightened
at
the
hints
he
had
heard
of
ghostly
visitations
indeed
that
had
been
the
real
reason
for
his
delay
in
arriving
he
had
not
been
willing
to
brave
the
darkness
of
the
night
before
this
was
his
secret
however
and
his
excuse
of
conflicting
duties
had
been
accepted
the
whole
party
gathered
in
the
hall
to
hear
what
the
newcomer
had
to
say
eve
and
milly
returned
the
latter
quivering
and
tearful
going
straight
to
her
husband
side
and
sitting
close
to
him
norma
was
pale
and
trembling
too
and
tracy
watchful
eye
regarded
her
sympathetically
as
he
led
her
to
a
seat
eve
and
calm
flitted
about
incessantly
she
went
to
the
kitchen
and
talked
over
household
matters
with
hester
for
milly
was
unable
to
do
this
then
returning
eve
went
into
the
drawing
room
and
after
a
few
moments
returned
closing
the
door
again
after
her
then
she
stepped
into
the
room
with
the
tassels
she
was
there
longer
but
at
last
came
out
and
locking
the
door
behind
her
retained
the
key
no
one
noticed
this
but
norma
and
she
kept
her
own
counsel
but
she
also
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
eve
even
before
he
went
to
look
at
the
bodies
of
the
two
victims
of
the
tragedy
doctor
crawford
asked
some
questions
his
slowness
was
maddening
to
the
alert
minds
of
his
listeners
but
he
methodically
arrived
at
the
facts
of
the
case
i
am
told
by
my
colleague
doctor
wayburn
he
said
that
there
is
no
mark
or
sign
on
the
remains
to
indicate
the
cause
of
death
there
will
of
course
be
need
of
autopsies
but
for
that
i
will
await
doctor
wayburn
return
he
will
be
here
shortly
meantime
i
will
inquire
concerning
this
strange
information
i
have
received
hinting
at
a
belief
in
ahem
in
spiritualism
by
some
of
the
people
here
present
is
such
belief
held
may
i
ask
perhaps
belief
is
too
strong
a
word
the
professor
volunteered
as
no
one
else
spoke
but
i
may
tell
you
that
we
came
here
to
this
house
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
the
truth
of
the
story
that
the
house
is
haunted
and
have
you
made
such
investigations
we
have
tried
to
do
so
the
results
have
been
mysterious
startling
and
now
tragic
but
i
can
not
say
we
have
proved
anything
except
that
supernatural
influences
have
most
assuredly
been
at
work
i
am
not
willing
to
accept
such
an
explanation
of
two
sudden
deaths
crawford
said
in
his
dignified
way
at
any
rate
not
without
a
most
exhaustive
investigation
into
the
possibility
of
their
having
been
brought
about
by
natural
agencies
let
me
take
up
first
the
case
of
bruce
was
this
gentleman
in
robust
health
entirely
so
said
landon
so
far
as
we
know
it
is
not
inconceivable
that
he
had
some
heart
trouble
or
other
malady
that
was
not
noticeable
but
of
that
i
can
not
say
positively
it
seems
to
me
doctor
you
would
better
look
at
him
you
might
note
some
symptom
that
would
enlighten
you
crawford
shuddered
perceptibly
but
tried
to
hide
his
disinclination
though
accustomed
to
gruesome
sights
his
dread
of
the
supernatural
was
such
that
he
feared
the
proposed
examination
however
ashamed
of
his
hesitation
he
rose
and
asked
to
be
shown
the
body
of
gifford
bruce
landon
started
to
officiate
but
milly
detaining
hand
held
him
back
the
professor
made
no
move
but
eve
and
tracy
started
simultaneously
to
rise
i
go
said
eve
a
little
officiously
and
tracy
sat
down
again
she
led
the
way
to
the
big
drawing
room
where
the
remains
of
gifford
bruce
lay
and
stood
by
while
doctor
crawford
looked
down
at
the
still
white
face
a
long
time
they
stood
there
no
word
being
spoken
then
eve
said
softly
do
let
your
disbelief
in
supernatural
powers
blind
you
to
their
possible
reality
there
are
many
matters
yet
unknown
and
spiritism
is
one
of
them
remember
that
we
who
are
here
gathered
are
sensitives
and
psychics
we
are
prepared
for
and
expect
experiences
not
vouchsafed
to
less
clairvoyant
natures
though
we
did
not
look
for
but
i
beg
of
you
sir
to
realize
that
there
are
things
of
which
you
have
no
cognizance
that
yet
are
real
and
effective
doctor
crawford
looked
at
the
speaker
in
the
partially
darkened
room
eve
strange
eyes
glittered
with
an
uncanny
light
her
face
was
pale
and
her
red
hair
like
a
flame
aureole
she
took
a
slow
step
nearer
to
the
doctor
and
he
recoiled
as
from
a
vampire
you
are
afraid
she
said
and
her
tone
was
exultant
do
not
be
afraid
the
phantasms
will
not
hurt
you
if
you
do
your
duty
unless
you
do
your
duty
she
stretched
her
hand
toward
him
and
again
he
drew
away
the
phantasms
will
haunt
you
you
her
voice
fell
to
the
merest
whisper
but
it
thrilled
through
the
room
like
a
clarion
note
to
the
shocked
ears
of
the
listening
man
against
his
will
her
eyes
held
his
against
his
will
without
his
volition
he
whispered
what
is
my
duty
to
declare
to
declare
in
accordance
with
your
own
conviction
in
proof
of
your
own
belief
that
these
two
deaths
were
the
direct
result
of
a
supernatural
power
what
power
you
know
not
but
you
do
know
remember
you
know
that
no
mortal
hand
brought
the
tragedy
about
either
the
hands
of
the
victims
themselves
or
of
any
one
else
fascinated
frightened
crawford
stared
at
this
strange
woman
he
had
never
before
encountered
such
a
face
such
a
sinuous
serpentine
form
a
personality
that
seemed
to
sway
his
very
being
that
seemed
to
dominate
and
control
his
whole
will
power
his
whole
brain
power
do
misunderstand
me
eve
went
on
do
think
for
a
moment
i
am
advising
you
wrongly
or
with
intent
to
deceive
only
i
see
you
know
nothing
of
occult
phenomena
and
moreover
you
are
even
ignorant
of
your
own
ignorance
of
them
therefore
seeing
too
your
quick
appreciation
and
perceptive
faculty
i
warn
you
not
to
ignore
or
forget
the
fact
that
these
things
exist
that
unseen
powers
hold
sway
over
us
all
and
they
be
reckoned
with
the
flattery
was
subtle
more
than
the
words
eve
glance
implied
a
keen
apprehension
on
the
part
of
the
doctor
which
as
he
did
possess
it
seemed
a
desirable
thing
to
him
and
he
gladly
assumed
that
he
had
it
and
now
eve
said
as
they
left
the
room
do
you
want
to
go
to
the
other
room
the
room
with
the
tassels
no
please
not
now
and
crawford
shuddered
for
he
had
heard
much
of
that
room
also
he
was
desirous
of
getting
back
to
more
normal
associates
than
this
strange
being
and
he
resolved
to
leave
the
examination
of
the
other
victim
until
the
return
of
his
fellow
physician
who
at
least
was
practical
and
an
unbeliever
in
spooks
shaken
by
the
whole
episode
doctor
crawford
concealed
his
disquiet
by
a
manner
even
more
slow
and
deliberate
than
usual
he
said
no
word
of
gifford
bruce
but
announced
his
desire
to
ask
a
few
general
questions
concerning
practical
matters
where
is
your
home
mr
landon
he
inquired
and
then
asked
the
same
question
of
each
he
learned
that
they
were
all
residents
of
new
york
city
except
tracy
who
had
lived
in
philadelphia
but
was
contemplating
a
move
to
new
york
i
have
had
a
call
to
a
pastorate
there
tracy
stated
and
it
seems
advisable
to
me
to
accept
it
bruce
lived
in
chicago
did
he
not
went
on
crawford
and
miss
reid
also
yes
said
landon
but
miss
reid
had
been
at
school
in
connecticut
for
the
last
three
years
she
was
graduated
in
june
and
her
uncle
and
guardian
bruce
came
east
for
the
occasion
they
concluded
to
spend
the
summer
with
us
intending
to
return
to
chicago
next
month
bruce
was
a
wealthy
man
inquired
the
questioner
yes
answered
landon
not
a
financial
magnate
but
worth
at
least
two
million
dollars
and
who
are
his
heirs
the
question
fell
like
a
bombshell
it
had
not
been
thought
of
or
at
least
not
spoken
of
by
any
of
the
party
the
bareness
of
it
the
implication
of
it
gave
a
shock
as
of
a
sudden
accusation
i
had
thought
of
that
wynne
landon
said
slowly
but
you
know
queried
crawford
of
course
i
know
unless
gifford
bruce
left
a
contradictory
will
his
estate
must
revert
to
rudolph
braye
the
son
of
why
wynne
interrupted
milly
you
a
cousin
i
am
and
landon
flushed
unaccountably
but
i
a
second
cousin
braye
would
inherit
unless
a
will
made
other
proviso
where
is
mr
braye
he
went
to
new
york
last
evening
and
has
not
yet
returned
you
expect
him
soon
this
afternoon
probably
of
course
he
has
realized
that
he
is
the
heir
of
a
great
fortune
but
naturally
he
would
not
discuss
it
last
evening
when
we
were
all
so
alarmed
and
excited
over
the
awfulness
of
the
situation
was
braye
present
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
no
landon
stopped
to
think
he
was
where
was
he
he
was
with
me
said
milly
we
went
in
his
car
to
east
dryden
we
went
to
the
markets
and
did
some
other
shopping
at
the
stores
and
when
you
returned
it
was
all
over
doctor
crawford
looked
gravely
at
her
yes
said
milly
we
were
both
away
and
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
have
stood
it
she
broke
down
and
sobbed
in
her
husband
arms
but
crawford
went
on
asking
questions
the
autopsy
will
show
he
said
but
i
will
ask
if
any
of
you
can
show
cause
to
suspect
that
a
poison
of
any
sort
could
have
been
administered
to
the
victims
of
this
disaster
not
possibly
said
professor
hardwick
we
were
at
tea
and
had
all
been
served
from
the
same
teapot
and
from
the
same
plates
of
cakes
i
can
affirm
this
for
i
thought
over
every
moment
of
the
occasion
bruce
had
taken
part
of
his
tea
and
had
eaten
part
of
his
cake
are
you
sure
of
this
the
coroner
interrupted
i
am
sure
that
he
sat
next
to
me
that
he
was
talking
to
me
and
that
he
received
his
tea
at
the
same
time
i
did
we
sat
stirring
our
cups
and
nibbling
our
cake
as
we
discussed
a
matter
in
which
we
were
both
interested
less
than
a
half
minute
before
that
man
died
he
was
as
well
as
he
had
ever
been
the
scene
is
perfectly
before
my
eyes
he
held
his
cup
and
saucer
in
one
hand
his
spoon
in
the
other
when
i
saw
his
eyes
open
queerly
his
face
change
to
a
clayey
gray
and
his
fingers
relaxed
letting
his
cup
fall
to
the
floor
i
set
down
my
cup
quickly
and
sprang
toward
him
but
in
an
instant
it
was
all
over
a
hush
fell
on
the
group
as
all
remembered
the
details
so
exactly
as
the
professor
had
related
them
and
the
young
lady
said
crawford
at
last
rousing
himself
from
thought
did
she
too
drink
tea
no
said
eve
carnforth
musingly
i
remember
i
was
just
fixing
vernie
tea
she
liked
it
sweet
and
i
was
adding
a
lump
of
sugar
when
the
commotion
began
i
noticed
miss
reid
first
i
think
offered
tracy
at
least
i
happened
to
look
toward
her
when
bruce
fell
forward
in
his
chair
she
made
a
slight
sound
as
of
horror
and
when
i
glanced
her
way
she
looked
so
stunned
i
thought
she
was
going
to
collapse
so
i
stepped
across
toward
her
as
i
did
so
she
looked
suddenly
very
strange
and
i
feared
she
was
ill
aside
from
her
shock
at
sight
of
bruce
i
grasped
her
by
the
shoulders
just
as
she
was
about
to
fall
she
cried
out
as
if
in
pain
and
then
miss
carnforth
came
to
my
assistance
and
we
laid
the
child
on
that
sofa
in
an
instant
she
too
was
gone
she
had
taken
no
tea
no
said
eve
positively
nor
any
cakes
as
a
rule
the
elders
were
served
first
and
vernie
last
so
there
is
no
chance
of
there
having
been
poison
in
the
tea
or
cakes
nor
could
it
be
possible
anyway
as
we
all
ate
them
did
we
every
one
present
affirmed
that
they
had
partaken
of
the
tea
and
the
cakes
and
declared
they
were
both
harmless
and
just
such
as
they
had
had
served
every
afternoon
since
their
arrival
that
settles
that
point
at
any
rate
and
the
coroner
nodded
his
head
there
can
be
no
question
of
poison
after
what
you
told
me
unless
either
or
both
of
them
took
poison
themselves
or
gave
it
to
the
other
intentionally
chapter
ix
conflicting
theories
in
the
kitchen
the
discussion
was
going
on
in
less
guarded
terms
it
murder
thorpe
declared
flatly
no
spooks
ever
killed
off
those
two
people
in
a
minute
just
like
that
murder
your
grandmother
snorted
stebbins
who
done
it
and
how
i
ask
you
that
those
folks
came
up
here
to
hunt
ghosts
and
i
should
say
they
found
good
and
plenty
you
know
well
i
do
this
house
has
always
been
ever
since
that
woman
killed
her
husband
in
that
very
room
where
the
little
girl
lyin
now
i
would
go
in
that
there
room
for
a
fortune
i
would
now
eli
do
be
foolish
and
thorpe
shook
his
head
how
could
a
spook
kill
two
folks
at
onct
right
out
in
the
open
as
you
may
say
for
that
matter
how
could
anybody
murder
two
people
at
once
nobody
was
around
but
their
own
crowd
and
that
lot
of
people
ai
for
each
other
i
know
that
it
was
spooks
declared
hester
with
an
air
of
settling
the
matter
i
smelled
of
late
that
smell
of
bitter
almonds
is
been
in
the
air
a
heap
and
i
ai
had
none
for
flavourin
or
anything
land
never
flavour
a
cake
with
that
i
put
vanilla
even
in
my
food
i
smelled
it
too
spoke
up
nannie
a
helper
of
the
older
woman
when
i
been
round
in
that
there
room
i
smelled
it
not
strong
you
know
but
jest
a
faint
whiff
then
i
skittled
out
fast
i
could
i
kin
tell
you
nope
you
all
wrong
insisted
old
thorpe
spooks

that
what
it
is
who
done
it
then
demanded
his
wife
that
i
dunno
but
i
have
my
how
i
dunno
either
but
neither
here
nor
there
murder
been
done
but
i
bet
that
crawford
ai
got
brains
enough
to
see
it
he
ai
got
brains
enough
to
go
in
when
it
rains
agreed
stebbins
but
you
off
thorpe
a
surmisin
murder
why
jest
instance
now
how
it
been
done
now
how
can
i
tell
that
thorpe
spoke
with
fine
scorn
i
do
know
all
the
goin
on
of
them
hifalutin
folks
but
if
you
heard
much
as
i
have
you
know
that
they
up
to
lots
of
things
such
as
us
ignorant
people
do
know
nothin
about
they
do
talk
awful
hifalutin
corroborated
hester
i
heard
say
things
that
had
no
meanin
whatsoever
to
me
and
yet
they
was
plain
english
too
well
if
you
ask
me
and
thorpe
looked
important
i
jest
say
keep
your
eye
on
one
of
them
women

mean
that
varmint
i
know

his
wife

handful

just
so
far
as
there
was
any

oh
i
kin
read
character
and
thorpe
plumed
himself
so
evidently
on
his
mental
powers
that
stebbins
snorted
outright
you
a
hummer
you
are
i
you
clairvoyant
yourself
well
let
me
advise
you
to
keep
your
trap
shut
about
miss
that
lady
you
referred
to
this
is
my
house
and
those
are
my
tenants
and
i
stand
any
talk
from
about
that
right
thorpe
admonished
his
wife
stebbins
he
right
an
he
right
about
the
ghosts
too
why
i
happen
to
know
that
the
spooks
warned
that
little
reid
girl
she
die
at
four
and
die
she
did
jest
at
four
can
you
beat
it
spooks
why
of
course
it
was
spooks
what
else
yes
and
the
message
was
that
two
of
die
and
two
of
did
added
stebbins
how
could
any
mortal
human
bein
bring
that
about
i
ask
you
land
i
do
know
i
told
you
i
did
but
and
thorpe
wagged
his
head
positively
it
was
spooks
the
same
questions
were
being
discussed
in
the
hall
by
the
ones
more
intimately
interested
doctor
wayburn
had
arrived
and
he
and
crawford
were
shut
in
the
drawing
room
endeavouring
to
wrest
from
the
unknown
the
secret
of
gifford
bruce
death
the
little
group
still
gathered
in
the
hall
were
talking
earnestly
of
the
immediate
future
it
so
pathetic
norma
was
saying
that
there
are
so
few
to
mourn
for
poor
little
vernie
that
child
had
actually
no
relatives
but
her
uncle
and
mr
braye
wynne
is
a
sort
of
a
cousin
too
put
in
milly
and
indeed
norma
i
feel
as
sorry
as
if
vernie
had
been
my
own
sister
oh
i
do
mean
that
of
course
we
all
feel
that
way
but
she
was
so
alone
in
the
world
braye
is
terribly
broken
up
he
loved
her
not
only
loved
her
said
eve
but
he
was
ambitious
for
her
he
wanted
her
put
in
care
of
a
capable
woman
this
fall
and
brought
up
properly
bruce
was
no
sort
of
a
guardian
for
the
child
i
mean
he
was
all
right
of
course
as
a
legal
guardian
but
he
was
no
man
to
have
charge
of
her
social
and
home
life
he
knew
that
said
landon
he
told
me
he
meant
to
have
vernie
properly
chaperoned
and
all
that
this
winter
she
was
a
dear
kiddie
oh
she
was
and
norma
wept
afresh
i
am
a
complete
convert
to
spiritualism
now
said
the
professor
gravely
i
thought
over
these
things
very
deeply
i
considered
every
possible
aspect
of
the
case
and
there
is
no
explanation
of
those
two
mysterious
deaths
except
supernormal
forces
it
is
no
use
to
shirk
the
supposition
of
murder
indeed
we
must
consider
it
very
carefully
but
it
is
out
of
the
question
nobody
could
have
compassed
those
two
deaths
in
an
instant
of
time
however
secret
or
subtle
the
methods
do
you
all
agree
of
course
said
eve
positively
and
tracy
added
that
is
undeniable
professor
foul
play
impossible
but
moreover
there
was
no
one
here
present
but
our
own
party
i
ca
let
the
implication
pass
that
it
could
have
been
in
the
heart
of
any
one
of
us
nonsense
interrupted
hardwick
that
absurd
tracy
when
i
speak
of
murder
it
is
in
the
abstract
and
because
it
is
right
that
we
should
consider
the
matter
from
every
angle
we
must
even
think
of
suicide
and
of
suicide
is
as
absurd
as
murder
said
landon
indignantly
but
what
other
atrocity
had
you
in
mind
do
lose
your
temper
please
the
professor
said
mildly
i
am
obliged
to
preserve
an
impersonal
attitude
or
i
ca
think
at
all
the
other
thought
is
that
one
of
the
victims
killed
himself
the
other
one
please
professor
said
eve
at
least
confine
yourself
to
rational
common
sense
but
since
you
raise
this
absurd
theory
let
settle
it
once
and
for
all
could
bruce
have
willingly
killed
himself
and
vernie
she
asked
of
them
all
no
replied
landon
bruce
was
fond
of
life
and
he
adored
that
child
cut
that
out
then
pursued
eve
could
vernie
have
killed
herself
and
her
uncle
rubbish
cried
landon
do
say
such
things
eve
professor
are
you
answered
and
remember
put
in
tracy
the
two
were
the
width
of
this
hall
apart
what
means
could
have
been
employed
what
means
were
employed
anyway
said
norma
oh
what
did
kill
those
people
the
utter
absence
of
any
material
means
proves
the
fact
that
it
was
supernatural
declared
the
professor
i
only
mentioned
those
other
theories
to
prove
their
absurdity
now
as
i
say
i
am
a
convert
to
spiritualism
in
all
its
form
and
phases
how
can
one
help
being
after
this
and
i
for
one
desire
to
stay
here
for
a
time
and
i
feel
sure
that
the
departed
spirits
of
our
friends
will
communicate
with
us
milly
shuddered
at
the
idea
but
eve
wonderful
eyes
glowed
with
a
sudden
anticipation
oh
professor
hardwick
she
exclaimed
how
splendid
will
you
really
stay
here
a
while
will
you
milly
i
ca
stay
unless
you
and
wynne
do
will
you
stay
norma
and
you
mr
tracy
oh
i
ca
milly
moaned
i
need
need
i
wynne
no
darling
not
if
you
do
want
to
i
ca
see
eve
why
you
wish
to
stay
here
it
gives
me
the
horrors
to
think
of
it
and
if
you
really
expect
spiritual
communications
from
vernie
or
bruce
you
can
receive
them
just
as
well
anywhere
else
not
just
as
well
demurred
the
professor
the
conditions
here
are
ideal
for
investigations
we
have
taken
it
up
seriously
you
know
but
miss
carnforth
ca
you
ask
some
other
friends
to
come
if
the
landons
prefer
to
return
to
new
york
i
do
doubt
you
know
the
right
ones
who
could
chaperon
you
and
also
take
an
interest
in
our
work
yes
began
eve
thoughtfully
and
then
stebbins
came
into
the
room
the
doctors
through
yet
he
asked
what
they
found
out
no
they
not
through
yet
answered
landon
sit
down
stebbins
and
talk
a
little
bit
i
wish
you
tell
us
of
anything
you
know
of
your
own
experience
not
hearsay
mind
you
that
has
happened
in
this
house
that
can
truly
be
called
supernatural
well
that
room
wait
a
minute
interrupted
landon
do
tell
us
anything
about
that
haunted
room
that
you
do
personally
to
be
a
fact
i
know
it
asserted
stebbins
doggedly
i
slept
there
and
i
seen
ghosts
spookin
around
in
it
do
you
think
there
are
really
such
things
as
ghosts
i
know
it
and
do
you
think
they
could
be
responsible
for
the
death
of
bruce
and
miss
reid
i
know
it
that
thorpe
he
says
it
murder
but
he
ca
guess
how
it
could
be
that
fool
of
a
crawford
he
do
know
nothing
of
any
sort
wayburn
now
he
a
fair
doctor
but
good
land
what
can
they
learn
from
a
those
people
was
warned
and
them
warnin
was
carried
out
what
more
is
there
to
learn
well
and
clearly
put
stebbins
commented
the
professor
no
elaboration
of
phrases
could
state
that
more
succinctly
they
were
warned
the
warnings
were
carried
out
that
is
the
whole
truth
but
granting
that
said
norma
and
i
willing
to
grant
it
why
did
the
spirits
want
to
kill
vernie
a
lovely
innocent
child
could
have
incurred
the
wrath
of
the
spirits
to
that
extent
they
ai
no
tellin
what
them
will
do
stebbins
spoke
heavily
as
if
burdened
with
fear
now
i
leave
it
to
you
folks
you
smelled
prussic
acid
around
i
have
said
norma
and
i
added
the
professor
i
know
it
was
not
brought
here
by
any
of
our
party
nor
not
by
the
cook
said
stebbins
hester
she
leery
of
that
bitter
almond
flavourin
and
she
do
never
use
it
well
do
that
smell
prove
somethin
it
is
actual
proof
and
tracy
looked
thoughtful
but
it
is
an
inexplicable
odour
to
hang
round
an
old
house
inexplicable
if
it
due
to
the
urged
stebbins
and
that
what
it
is
due
to
why
that
smell
been
said
to
be
round
here
ever
since
the
time
of
the
montgomery
murder
what
wrong
between
you
and
doctor
crawford
asked
eve
suddenly
you
say
yourself
you
are
good
friends
no
we
ai
it
a
sort
o
feud
of
long
standin
they
ai
no
special
reason
jest
a
conglomeration
of
little
things
but
one
thing
is
he
makes
fun
of
the
spooks
here
he
do
take
no
stock
in
such
things
and
nobody
can
make
him
thorpe
now
he
do
neither
he
sticks
to
it
bruce
and
miss
vernie
was
murdered
by
what
means
does
he
think
asked
eve
quickly
well
that
he
do
know
but
murder
he
says
it
was
and
that
he
sticks
to
like
a
puppy
to
a
root
get
him
in
here
said
landon
abruptly
and
thorpe
was
summoned
yes
sir
the
butler
averred
on
being
questioned
i
willin
to
go
on
record
as
a
disbeliever
in
spooks
they
ai
no
such
things
i
deny
i
been
some
scared
up
hearin
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
talk
about
such
matters
but
i
do
believe
in
and
i
never
will
them
two
pore
critters
was
done
to
death
but
i
free
to
confess
i
ca
see
how
professor
hardwick
looked
at
the
speaker
as
dooley
observed
he
said
your
remarks
is
inthrestin
but
not
convincin
my
man
if
there
is
no
possible
way
that
murder
could
have
been
done
and
we
in
here
are
agreed
on
that
point
what
is
left
but
the
inevitability
of
supernormal
agents
your
long
words
gets
me
sir
but
it
do
make
no
difference
it
spooks
he
hopeless
said
tracy
let
ask
him
other
things
thorpe
my
man
have
you
never
seen
any
circumstance
or
occurrence
in
this
house
that
you
could
explain
by
natural
means
i
ai
never
been
in
this
house
sir
except
as
i
came
here
to
buttle
for
you
folks
stebbins
he
give
the
job
to
me
and
my
wife
we
honest
people
and
he
knew
he
could
trust
us
not
to
tattle
or
tell
no
tales
of
your
goin
on
he
says
says
he
a
queer
lot
what
comin
up
here
but
they
my
tenants
and
i
do
want
bothered
none
by
gossip
and
to
the
village
ai
that
right
mr
stebbins
just
so
said
stebbins
calmly
them
just
about
my
very
words
you
told
me
landon
that
you
were
a
crowd
of
and
so
it
was
up
to
me
to
spare
you
all
the
annoyance
i
could
an
well
i
know
how
the
villagers
gossip
about
this
here
house
if
they
get
a
chance
so
with
the
thorpes
at
the
head
of
things
and
a
couple
of
good
girls
for
helpers
i
you
not
be
troubled
and
you
been
up
to
now
but
this
thing
ca
be
kept
quiet
no
longer
of
course
a
thing
like
this
is
more
or
less
public
property
and
i
can
tell
you
there
be
plenty
of
curious
villagers
up
here
to
the
inquest
and
all
that
inquest
cried
eve
what
do
you
mean
jest
that
that
coroner
or
county
physician
as
he
really
is
he
set
on
havin
an
inquest
says
he
got
to
well
i
do
know
much
about
law
but
if
they
can
ketch
and
hang
a
let
do
it
say
i
the
arrival
on
the
scene
of
the
two
doctors
cut
short
further
discussion
there
is
a
strange
condition
of
things
crawford
began
addressing
himself
to
wynne
landon
we
find
decisive
though
very
slight
evidence
that
bruce
died
from
poison
a
hush
followed
as
his
stunned
hearers
thought
over
the
grave
significance
of
this
statement
poison
repeated
landon
dazedly
what
sort
of
poison
who
administered
it
as
i
said
resumed
the
coroner
it
a
strange
case
the
poison
found
is
the
minutest
quantity
of
a
very
powerful
drug
known
among
the
profession
as
strychnine
hydrochlorate
this
is
so
deadly
that
a
half
grain
will
kill
a
man
instantly
or
in
a
few
seconds
but
my
colleague
and
i
have
agreed
that
since
it
is
impossible
for
this
to
have
been
administered
at
the
moment
of
bruce
death
it
must
be
that
he
had
taken
it
in
cumulative
doses
and
the
result
culminated
in
his
sudden
death
why
would
he
take
it
cried
milly
where
could
he
get
it
asked
the
professor
such
a
drug
is
not
available
to
the
general
public
is
it
it
is
not
sir
but
whoever
gave
it
to
him
must
have
procured
it
somehow
those
questions
are
for
the
future
we
are
just
learning
the
facts
the
results
of
our
tests
prove
positively
the
presence
of
that
particular
poison
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
but
wait
and
eve
fixed
her
compelling
eyes
on
the
coroner
face
remember
doctor
crawford
though
you
may
not
believe
in
the
occult
other
and
wiser
minds
do
i
wish
to
remind
you
therefore
that
we
who
believe
these
deaths
were
caused
by
supernatural
agency
believe
also
that
the
powers
that
compassed
the
deaths
are
able
to
make
the
deaths
seem
attributable
to
natural
causes
whether
poison
or
anything
else
eve
exclaimed
milly
that
is
going
too
far
not
at
all
said
the
professor
miss
carnforth
is
quite
right
and
indeed
logic
must
prove
that
if
a
phantasm
can
take
away
a
human
life
it
can
also
produce
effects
that
resemble
conditions
brought
about
by
human
means
i
repeat
the
coroner
interrupted
these
things
are
beside
the
question
we
are
conducting
an
autopsy
not
an
inquest
at
present
i
am
giving
you
my
report
as
a
medical
man
not
as
a
member
of
the
police
force
those
other
matters
will
be
considered
later
we
have
completed
our
examinations
in
the
one
case
we
will
now
proceed
to
the
case
of
the
other
victim
they
killed
each
other
thorpe
broke
in
nodding
his
head
in
the
positive
manner
he
affected
leastwise
one
of
killed
both
and
of
course
miss
vernie
she
was
no
murderer
wait
till
you
are
called
upon
to
testify
my
man
and
crawford
glowered
at
the
forwardness
of
the
old
butler
there
be
testifyin
on
both
sides
volunteered
stebbins
speaking
a
little
belligerently
crawford
turned
on
him
and
it
was
easily
seen
that
enmity
existed
between
these
two
you
stebbins
keep
quiet
he
admonished
there
them
that
says
you
know
too
much
about
these
doings
anyhow
what
do
you
mean
by
that
stebbins
eyes
glowed
with
anger
nothing
now
and
maybe
nothing
at
any
time
but
you
better
lie
low
you
might
be
unduly
suspected
of
your
own
house
to
the
surprise
of
all
present
stebbins
turned
a
chalky
white
and
whimpered
a
little
as
he
said
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
done
anything
see
you
do
advised
crawford
enigmatically
and
then
the
two
doctors
started
to
go
on
their
second
gruesome
errand
this
door
locked
announced
doctor
wayburn
trying
to
gain
entrance
to
the
room
with
the
tassels
i
have
the
key
said
eve
carnforth
slowly
and
with
a
white
face
she
offered
it
to
the
men
what
are
doing
with
it
asked
landon
in
amazement
i
know
and
eve
showed
great
nervousness
i
think
i
feared
some
one
would
go
in
there
the
others
looked
at
her
curiously
for
the
white
face
was
pallid
and
the
scarlet
line
of
her
lips
was
thin
and
straight
an
exclamation
from
doctor
wayburn
claimed
their
attention
and
speaking
from
the
doorway
of
the
room
with
the
tassels
he
said
there
is
no
body
here
what
cried
several
at
once
and
crowded
to
the
door
absolutely
none
repeated
the
doctor
and
professor
hardwick
pushed
his
way
past
the
two
medical
men
and
entered
the
room
it
gone
he
said
reappearing
vernie
body
is
gone
impossible
cried
landon
what
do
you
mean
why
we
all
been
right
here
all
the
morning
how
could
it
be
gone
see
for
yourself
and
hardwick
stepped
aside
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
scrutiny
of
the
whole
room
showed
no
presence
of
the
cold
still
form
that
had
been
reverently
laid
on
that
bed
everybody
entered
and
peered
around
fruitlessly
they
shook
the
heavy
hangings
and
looked
behind
them
but
to
no
avail
vernie
body
had
utterly
disappeared
chapter
x
was
it
supernatural
late
that
afternoon
braye
returned
from
new
york
he
looked
weary
and
exhausted
as
if
under
hard
and
continuous
strain
norma
and
eve
had
both
been
watching
for
him
from
different
windows
and
met
on
the
stairs
in
their
sudden
rush
to
meet
him
in
the
hall
it
was
easily
apparent
that
both
girls
desired
to
see
him
first
and
tell
him
the
further
awful
development
of
the
disappearance
of
vernie
body
what
he
exclaimed
more
horrors
wait
a
minute
till
i
get
off
this
dust
coat
before
eve
or
norma
could
say
more
the
others
hearing
braye
came
trooping
to
the
hall
and
all
began
to
talk
at
once
i
ca
understand
and
braye
wearily
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
tell
me
all
that
happened
after
i
left
last
evening
nothing
especial
said
tracy
quietly
we
all
went
to
bed
early
at
least
we
went
to
our
rooms
professor
hardwick
and
i
sat
up
half
the
night
talking
but
we
left
thorpe
on
guard
in
the
hall
here
and
of
course
it
never
occurred
to
any
of
us
there
was
need
of
further
precaution
nor
was
there
said
eve
fixing
her
great
eyes
on
braye
nobody
could
possibly
come
in
from
outside
and
take
that
child
away
the
house
is
too
securely
locked
for
that
as
we
all
know
why
should
any
one
want
to
queried
braye
his
face
blank
with
amazement
no
one
did
want
to
no
one
did
do
it
returned
eve
you
must
admit
rudolph
that
the
whole
thing
is
supernatural
that
no
eve
i
ca
do
that
braye
spoke
positively
when
i
up
here
with
you
psychists
and
in
this
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
lord
knows
aspens
is
mysterious
i
get
swayed
over
toward
spiritualism
but
when
i
go
down
to
the
city
and
talk
with
rational
men
i
realize
there
nothing
in
this
poppycock
oh
you
do
and
eve
penetrating
glance
seemed
to
bore
into
his
very
soul
then
pray
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
vernie
is
there
i
do
know
eve
i
do
know
but
some
fiend
in
human
shape
must
have
managed
to
get
into
the
house
and
get
out
again
said
tracy
and
carry
the
body
with
him
when
thorpe
sat
right
here
in
the
hall
where
was
thorpe
asked
braye
suddenly
in
a
chair
there
by
that
table
and
eve
indicated
a
position
well
back
in
the
great
hall
then
he
could
see
the
doors
of
both
rooms
began
braye
but
professor
hardwick
interrupted
nonsense
man
both
doors
were
open
if
any
move
had
been
made
thorpe
must
have
heard
it
both
doors
open
said
braye
norma
you
said
they
were
closed
when
you
came
down
to
breakfast
i
asked
thorpe
about
that
said
tracy
he
told
me
that
at
daybreak
or
soon
after
he
closed
the
doors
without
looking
in
the
rooms
he
was
scared
i
think
though
he
wo
admit
that
he
says
he
thought
the
ladies
would
be
coming
down
and
the
doors
better
be
closed
that
all
right
but
it
strange
that
he
did
glance
into
the
rooms
i
do
think
so
said
landon
thorpe
was
in
charge
but
he
had
no
reason
to
think
there
had
been
any
disturbance
and
he
is
pretty
well
scared
up
over
the
whole
matter
and
i
do
wonder
nor
i
said
braye
it
all
inexplicable
what
crawford
going
to
do
next
i
not
sure
said
tracy
but
i
think
he
hold
an
inquest
of
course
thinks
it
a
case
of
murder
how
absurd
cried
eve
what
more
does
the
man
want
in
confirmation
of
the
supernatural
first
those
two
deaths
impossible
of
human
achievement
and
now
the
taking
away
of
poor
little
vernie
in
circumstances
that
deny
any
mortal
hand
in
the
matter
if
that
true
eve
braye
spoke
in
a
tone
it
will
do
no
harm
to
let
the
coroner
proceed
along
his
own
lines
he
ca
convict
a
murderer
if
there
is
one
and
if
there
is
one
we
all
want
him
convicted
do
we
of
course
said
landon
but
suppose
they
pitch
on
an
innocent
man
it
supposition
declared
braye
i
never
heard
of
such
a
moil
i
ca
see
how
it
be
murder
or
yet
i
ca
stand
for
either
say
it
murder
where
a
motive
for
anybody
i
think
you
ought
to
know
rudolph
eve
said
slowly
that
that
crawford
person
asked
who
would
inherit
bruce
money
and
and
we
owned
up
that
you
were
the
next
of
kin
old
chap
put
in
landon
smiling
grimly
any
remarks
do
be
flippant
wynne
said
braye
seriously
of
course
thought
of
that
i
ca
very
well
be
charged
with
the
murder
as
i
was
here
at
the
time
but
i
do
feel
deeply
embarrassed
at
the
thought
that
i
am
without
a
doubt
the
next
heir
that
can
i
suppose
draw
suspicion
on
me
as
i
may
be
said
to
have
motive
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
for
there
no
possible
way
i
could
have
turned
the
trick
but
if
it
murder
if
there
the
slightest
indication
of
foul
play
ready
to
devote
all
of
uncle
gifford
money
if
need
be
in
bringing
the
criminal
to
justice
of
course
there
no
sense
in
tacking
the
crime
on
you
braye
and
landon
sighed
if
it
was
a
crime
and
if
anybody
here
committed
it
they
more
likely
suspect
me
for
i
the
next
heir
after
you
and
if
i
could
despatch
two
intervening
heirs
i
could
also
bump
you
off
i
suppose
do
talk
like
that
wynne
implored
milly
it
not
like
you
and
i
i
only
preparing
you
milly
dear
for
what
may
come
that
coroner
ca
rest
till
he
fastens
murder
on
somebody
and
it
might
as
well
be
me
i
want
to
go
home
wynne
i
want
to
go
back
to
new
york
and
milly
began
to
cry
you
may
dear
just
as
soon
as
you
like
but
i
must
stay
and
see
what
happens
up
here
for
me
to
run
away
would
be
to
say
the
least
suspicious
talk
sense
wynne
broke
in
braye
i
was
here
you
know
when
those
two
people
died
tell
me
again
just
where
were
you
all
bruce
and
professor
hardwick
sat
in
those
two
chairs
confabbing
wynne
explained
i
was
passing
things
round
so
was
tracy
eve
was
running
the
tea
things
vernie
was
jumping
about
here
and
there
and
norma
where
were
you
norma
i
was
near
bruce
and
the
professor
listening
to
their
talk
she
returned
i
was
greatly
interested
landon
had
just
given
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
i
was
sipping
it
as
i
listened
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
the
tea
of
that
i
certain
of
course
there
was
agreed
braye
who
had
heard
the
scene
rehearsed
many
times
there
nothing
wrong
anywhere
that
i
can
see
except
that
a
dreadful
thing
has
happened
and
we
must
find
out
all
we
can
about
it
i
been
to
see
uncle
gif
business
friends
he
has
a
few
in
new
york
and
they
flabbergasted
of
course
one
of
them
a
jennings
is
sure
it
a
desperate
murder
cleverly
contrived
by
some
people
in
chicago
who
are
enemies
of
uncle
and
who
he
says
are
diabolically
ingenious
enough
to
have
brought
it
about
he
holds
that
vernie
death
was
accidental
i
mean
that
they
only
intended
to
kill
uncle
gifford
i
ca
believe
in
this
talk
for
how
could
it
have
been
brought
about
but
jennings
thinks
it
was
through
the
servants
and
that
they
really
enemies
in
disguise
why
they
all
natives
of
this
section
exclaimed
the
professor
how
could
they
be
implicated
i
told
jennings
that
but
he
thinks
they
been
bought
over
or
oh
lord
i
do
know
he
thinks
i
do
know
what
to
think
myself
there
solution
do
think
now
rudolph
and
eve
came
over
to
his
side
and
took
his
hand
in
hers
you
all
tired
out
and
i
do
wonder
let
have
tea
we
must
dread
tea
because
of
its
associations
if
we
do
that
we
all
collapse
with
a
determined
air
eve
went
away
to
order
tea
served
as
usual
though
milly
had
declared
she
never
wanted
to
have
it
in
that
hall
again
but
eve
idea
found
favour
with
the
rest
and
they
gratefully
accepted
the
refreshment
which
until
that
awful
afternoon
had
been
such
a
pleasant
function
we
must
settle
some
things
braye
said
looking
at
landon
i
arranged
to
send
the
bodies
to
chicago
of
course
i
did
know
is
it
terrible
exclaimed
norma
what
shall
you
do
now
i
think
i
send
uncle
gif
body
at
once
and
hope
to
find
later
it
be
found
braye
looked
about
wildly
i
wish
i
had
been
here
last
night
oh
forgive
me
i
not
casting
any
hint
of
blame
on
you
others
but
well
you
know
i
was
here
when
when
it
happened
either
and
i
ca
sense
it
all
as
you
do
professor
hardwick
what
do
you
think
about
it
all
i
an
old
man
braye
and
i
had
wide
experience
also
i
a
hard
one
to
convince
without
strong
and
definite
proof
but
i
state
now
once
for
all
that
i
a
complete
convert
to
spiritism
and
i
believe
i
know
these
deaths
of
our
friends
were
the
acts
of
an
inimical
spirit
a
phantasm
incensed
at
our
curiosity
concerning
the
occult
and
our
frivolous
attitude
toward
the
whole
subject
you
really
believe
that
professor
i
really
do
braye
and
moreover
i
am
convinced
that
the
disappearance
of
of
little
vernie
is
the
work
of
the
evil
spirit
what
else
can
explain
it
nothing
that
i
know
of
but
i
ca
swallow
the
idea
of
a
disembodied
spirit
making
off
with
a
real
material
body
i
i
been
here
did
see
or
hear
no
declared
landon
but
norma
gave
a
quick
glance
at
eve
who
returned
it
with
a
defiant
toss
of
her
head
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
norma
she
asked
shortly
why
do
i
norma
repeated
in
a
soft
significant
tone
i
think
you
know
eve
well
i
for
one
shall
stay
up
here
for
a
time
and
see
how
matters
go
on
said
braye
with
sudden
determination
who
else
wants
to
stay
i
do
said
professor
hardwick
i
think
we
by
no
means
seen
the
last
of
the
manifestations
and
though
i
feel
there
is
a
danger
i
am
ready
to
brave
it
for
the
sake
of
investigating
further
i
do
want
to
stay
and
milly
shook
with
nervous
apprehension
we
go
home
wynne
very
soon
darling
you
can
go
at
once
and
i
follow
as
soon
as
things
are
adjusted
up
here
i
think
none
of
us
ought
to
seem
to
run
away
certainly
not
tracy
agreed
promptly
the
whole
affair
is
so
astounding
i
can
scarcely
get
my
wits
together
but
i
see
clearly
no
one
must
leave
this
house
until
we
are
all
exonerated
from
suspicion
not
even
me
asked
milly
tearfully
that
for
you
and
landon
to
decide
returned
tracy
gently
not
dictating
not
even
advising
but
i
have
strong
opinions
on
the
subject
what
say
braye
i
quite
agree
with
you
tracy
but
i
sure
if
landon
prefers
to
go
down
to
new
york
and
stay
at
her
mother
no
one
could
possibly
object
but
i
do
milly
surprised
them
all
by
saying
if
you
put
it
that
way
if
it
cowardly
to
go
away
i
do
want
to
go
i
want
to
stay
if
wynne
does
and
if
eve
and
norma
stay
that
my
brave
girl
and
landon
smiled
at
his
wife
i
guarantee
that
milly
wo
make
any
trouble
either
once
she
awake
to
a
duty
she
bold
as
a
lion
now
see
here
if
crawford
stirs
up
suspicion
of
any
of
us
we
have
to
deal
with
him
pretty
roughly
i
fear
he
a
sort
and
he
will
move
heaven
and
earth
to
gain
his
point
moreover
we
ca
expect
him
to
subscribe
to
spook
theories
any
more
than
those
men
rudolph
talked
to
in
new
york
one
has
to
go
through
some
such
experiences
as
we
have
to
believe
in
them
you
professor
would
never
have
been
convinced
by
hearsay
evidence
would
you
no
sir
i
would
not
it
took
these
otherwise
inexplicable
happenings
to
prove
to
me
that
there
is
but
one
way
to
look
even
a
coroner
produce
a
human
criminal
who
could
kill
those
two
people
the
way
they
were
killed
and
who
could
get
into
and
out
of
this
house
and
take
a
human
body
with
him
the
thing
is
preposterous
you
know
the
doors
and
windows
were
all
locked
asked
braye
thoughtfully
i
looked
after
them
myself
said
landon
i
always
do
after
the
last
one
goes
upstairs
for
the
night
i
invariably
look
after
the
locking
up
and
the
house
properly
locked
is
impregnable
the
servants
quarters
are
shut
off
and
locked
there
is
absolutely
no
way
of
getting
in
from
outside
going
back
to
jennings
theory
mused
braye
could
we
suspect
old
thorpe
not
for
a
minute
declared
landon
and
too
he
was
in
the
hall
when
they
died
no
i
trust
thorpe
as
far
as
i
would
any
of
ourselves
but
there
stebbins
i
never
felt
sure
that
he
entirely
trustworthy
even
so
said
braye
he
was
here
when
when
they
died
no
he
was
i
ca
see
any
way
he
could
have
arranged
things
unless
he
poisoned
the
cake
rubbish
wynne
cried
eve
you
know
we
all
ate
that
cake
do
be
rational
but
bruce
was
poisoned
eve
we
ca
get
away
from
that
of
course
he
was
broke
in
hardwick
and
doubtless
vernie
was
too
but
it
was
not
done
by
human
agency
well
there
we
go
reasoning
round
in
a
circle
murmured
norma
i
think
our
talk
is
useless
when
we
surmise
and
speculate
about
it
all
let
us
decide
on
our
immediate
plans
shall
you
send
bruce
body
to
chicago
and
stay
here
yourself
rudolph
yes
as
i
look
at
it
now
i
ca
see
anything
else
to
do
nor
was
there
anything
else
to
do
for
doctor
crawford
persisted
in
treating
the
case
as
a
criminal
one
and
requested
that
all
concerned
remain
at
black
aspens
for
the
present
with
a
hint
that
unless
they
did
so
the
request
might
become
a
command
then
you
think
the
two
people
were
murdered
asked
landon
of
the
county
physician
i
do
say
that
for
sure
but
when
a
man
drops
dead
and
a
trace
of
poison
is
found
in
his
stomach
it
looks
mighty
like
an
intention
of
death
on
some
one
part
maybe
the
man
himself
there
a
show
of
suicide
you
know
but
gifford
bruce
never
would
commit
suicide
if
only
those
committed
suicide
who
are
expected
to
do
so
there
be
mighty
few
of
them
now
i
hold
that
poison
was
taken
into
stomach
while
he
was
eating
that
cake
or
whatever
he
did
eat
we
agree
to
that
landon
spoke
slowly
but
some
of
us
think
the
poison
was
put
in
by
supernatural
means
now
ai
that
nonsense
for
reasonable
rational
men
and
fine
scorn
nettled
landon
professor
hardwick
does
think
it
nonsense
he
returned
the
two
were
alone
crawford
having
asked
an
interview
with
the
man
who
had
rented
the
house
professor
and
crawford
fairly
snorted
for
fool
theories
commend
me
to
a
college
professor
they
ca
see
two
inches
either
side
of
their
noses
we
have
had
reason
to
believe
in
spiritual
manifestations
went
on
braye
yes
and
who
gave
you
those
reasons
who
rented
this
house
to
you
folks
for
the
sole
purpose
of
supplying
you
with
a
house
who
knew
that
ghosts
must
be
forthcoming
if
you
folks
was
to
be
satisfied
who
performed
ghost
doings
himself
in
order
that
you
might
not
be
disappointed
what
are
you
implying
that
that
the
owner
tricked
us
that
for
you
to
find
out
you
came
up
here
to
investigate
as
i
understand
it
well
why
you
investigate
you
swallow
all
them
ghosts
and
and
never
look
around
to
see
who
fooling
you
but
doctor
crawford
what
you
insinuate
is
not
possible
all
the
strange
things
we
have
seen
or
heard
have
occurred
at
night
or
yes
occasionally
in
the
daytime
but
always
when
stebbins
was
at
his
home
in
east
dryden
how
do
you
know
he
was
why
he
has
never
been
to
the
house
at
all
except
two
or
three
times
on
commonplace
errands
since
we
been
here
the
supernatural
manifestations
we
have
observed
had
no
more
to
do
with
him
than
they
had
with
you
that
as
may
be
only
i
advise
you
to
investigate
with
a
little
common
sense
and
not
too
much
blind
faith
in
your
spook
visitors
now
landon
i
take
it
you
boss
around
here
i
responsible
for
the
house
rent
if
that
what
you
mean
well
that
do
now
sir
there
got
to
be
an
inquest
i
expected
of
course
to
hold
it
on
the
two
bodies
but
since
one
gone
we
have
to
do
what
we
can
without
it
i
do
deny
that
this
case
is
beyond
all
my
experience
i
sent
for
a
detective
from
new
york
and
i
get
all
the
other
help
i
need
but
i
all
at
sea
myself
and
i
make
no
secret
of
that
i
thought
you
suspected
eli
stebbins
not
of
murder
no
sir
eli
we
ai
good
friends
have
been
for
years
and
i
would
put
it
past
him
to
play
ghost
to
scare
you
city
people
but
murder
land
no
i
would
ever
accuse
eli
stebbins
of
goin
that
far
have
you
any
definite
suspect
i
do
say
as
i
have
and
i
do
say
as
i
ai
truth
is
i
all
afloat
i
do
know
which
way
to
turn
every
thing
so
awful
unbelievable
as
you
might
say
now
there
them
two
thorpes
good
new
england
people
they
are
and
yet
if
i
had
any
reason
to
suspect
i
can
see
myself
doing
so
but
land
there
ai
a
shred
of
evidence
that
way
why
they
was
even
in
the
room
when
the
two
of
died
wait
a
minute
doctor
crawford
nobody
was
in
the
room
at
the
time
of
those
two
deaths
but
our
own
party
you
do
suspect
one
of
us
do
you
no
landon
i
do
you
ai
a
gay
crowd
nor
yet
a
fast
or
a
common
crowd
you
all
quiet
citizens
as
i
size
you
up
to
be
sure
decent
citizens
have
committed
murder
but
i
ca
connect
up
any
one
of
you
with
crime
in
this
case
i
know
braye
will
inherit
the
money
that
old
bruce
left
and
i
know
that
related
there
too
but
i
have
seen
one
iota
of
reason
to
suspect
any
one
of
your
crowd
if
i
do
i
let
you
know
mighty
quick
nor
can
i
hang
it
on
the
thorpes
nor
yet
on
those
girls
they
have
in
to
help
and
that
what
the
inquest
for
to
bring
out
if
possible
some
evidence
against
somebody
so
we
can
get
a
start
i
fear
you
ca
get
that
evidence
doctor
for
if
there
were
any
we
would
have
found
it
ourselves
you
have
my
good
wishes
for
if
it
is
a
case
of
murder
committed
by
a
living
human
villain
we
most
assuredly
want
him
apprehended
he
will
be
landon
take
it
from
me
he
will
be
chapter
xi
the
heir
speaks
out
the
days
that
followed
were
like
an
awful
nightmare
to
the
people
most
interested
but
at
last
the
inquest
was
over
the
body
of
gifford
bruce
had
been
sent
to
chicago
for
burial
and
a
strange
quiet
had
settled
down
upon
the
household
at
black
aspens
no
new
facts
had
transpired
at
the
inquest
though
the
police
tried
hard
to
fasten
the
crime
on
some
individual
there
was
no
definite
evidence
against
any
one
all
those
who
had
been
present
at
the
mysterious
death
hour
told
their
stories
straightforwardly
and
unshakably
all
agreed
as
to
the
circumstances
all
remembered
and
related
the
story
of
the
ouija
board
which
foretold
the
death
of
two
of
the
party
at
four
who
was
pushing
that
board
the
coroner
asked
miss
reid
and
myself
tracy
spoke
up
we
had
been
playing
with
it
for
some
time
and
having
had
only
uninteresting
and
trifling
results
we
were
about
to
lay
the
thing
aside
when
the
message
came
that
two
of
us
would
die
the
next
day
at
four
miss
reid
seemed
frightened
but
i
thought
at
the
time
she
had
spelled
out
the
message
herself
to
get
up
a
little
excitement
however
i
took
the
board
away
from
her
at
once
feeling
that
she
was
carrying
a
jest
too
far
i
think
now
that
she
was
innocent
in
the
matter
well
i
do
said
the
coroner
if
that
girl
made
up
that
message
she
had
a
reason
probably
she
was
responsible
for
both
deaths
impossible
cried
tracy
shocked
at
this
theory
why
she
was
but
a
child
she
had
no
thought
of
suicide
or
or
murder
if
she
faked
the
message
it
was
merely
in
fun
and
because
she
had
tried
all
evening
to
get
some
message
of
interest
it
is
quite
possible
she
made
up
the
message
but
it
is
not
possible
that
she
did
it
otherwise
than
as
a
jest
a
gruesome
jest
as
it
turned
out
yes
indeed
but
either
it
was
in
jest
or
the
message
was
from
a
supernatural
source
tracy
eyes
were
deeply
sorrowful
and
his
face
expressed
a
sort
of
awed
wonder
that
made
many
who
were
present
think
that
after
all
there
might
be
something
in
these
occult
beliefs
but
not
so
the
coroner
he
refused
to
consider
the
ouija
message
with
any
serious
interest
and
continued
to
ply
his
witnesses
with
questions
both
pertinent
and
wide
of
the
mark
elijah
stebbins
was
put
through
a
grilling
inquiry
his
manner
was
that
of
a
guilty
man
but
no
proof
of
crime
could
be
found
in
connection
with
him
the
day
and
hour
of
the
two
deaths
he
was
proved
to
have
been
at
his
home
in
east
dryden
beyond
all
doubt
even
granting
that
the
thorpes
one
or
both
were
in
his
employ
there
was
no
reason
to
suspect
them
if
they
had
put
poison
in
the
cakes
or
in
the
tea
it
must
have
been
done
in
the
kitchen
and
therefore
would
have
affected
the
whole
supply
suspicion
must
fall
if
anywhere
on
the
members
of
the
house
party
who
were
present
at
the
hour
of
four
on
the
fatal
day
but
these
as
has
been
said
gave
so
clear
a
statement
of
the
actual
happenings
at
that
hour
that
there
was
no
loophole
for
suspicion
to
enter
moreover
the
fact
that
the
deaths
occurred
simultaneously
and
just
at
the
foretold
hour
seemed
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
any
human
means
being
employed
it
did
look
like
a
supernatural
occurrence
and
many
who
would
have
scorned
such
a
belief
were
inevitably
led
to
agree
that
no
other
theory
could
explain
it
yet
the
coroner
and
his
jury
were
unwilling
to
admit
this
and
the
verdict
was
the
one
most
frequently
heard
of
murder
by
a
person
or
persons
unknown
indeed
what
else
could
it
have
been
a
coroner
jury
ca
accuse
a
nameless
ghost
of
two
murders
by
poison
they
pinned
their
faith
to
that
poison
discovered
in
the
stomach
of
the
body
of
gifford
bruce
they
assumed
that
miss
reid
died
from
the
effects
of
the
same
poison
but
how
administered
or
by
whom
or
what
had
become
of
the
body
of
miss
reid
they
had
no
idea
but
of
one
thing
they
were
sure
that
all
these
things
and
all
parts
of
the
complicated
crime
were
the
work
of
human
hands
and
human
intelligence
and
that
for
the
reputation
of
their
village
and
their
county
and
their
state
the
murderer
must
be
discovered
and
brought
to
justice
but
how
how
find
a
criminal
who
gave
no
signs
of
existence
and
who
was
by
those
most
closely
concerned
denied
actual
existence
the
detective
one
dan
peterson
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
a
closed
mouth
implies
great
secret
wisdom
he
said
little
save
to
ask
questions
of
everybody
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
and
as
these
questions
merely
carried
him
round
in
a
circle
back
to
his
starting
point
he
made
little
progress
there
were
also
of
course
many
reporters
from
the
city
papers
and
these
wrote
up
the
story
as
their
natures
or
their
chiefs
dictated
some
played
up
the
supernatural
side
for
all
it
was
worth
and
more
others
scorned
such
foolishness
and
treated
the
affair
as
a
desperate
and
unusually
mysterious
murder
case
but
all
agreed
that
it
was
the
most
sensational
and
interesting
affair
of
its
sort
that
had
happened
in
years
and
the
eager
reporters
hung
around
and
nearly
drove
frantic
the
feminine
members
of
the
house
party
at
last
norma
and
milly
refused
to
see
them
but
eve
carnforth
continued
to
talk
with
them
and
imbued
many
of
them
more
or
less
with
her
occult
views
there
something
in
what
that
woman
says
one
reporter
opined
to
his
fellow
she
puts
it
mighty
convincing
if
you
ask
me
yes
and
why
jeered
his
friend
because
she
the
man
behind
the
ghost
what
miss
carnforth
guilty
never
i
not
so
sure
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
spook
talk
is
all
rubbish
but
she
so
bent
and
determined
to
stuff
it
down
neck
i
think
she
hiding
her
own
hand
in
the
matter
you
do
well
you
better
think
again
before
you
let
out
any
such
yarn
as
that
why
she
a
queen
that
woman
is
oho
she
subjugated
you
has
she
well
look
out
that
she
convert
you
to
spookism
you
lose
your
job
other
curious
people
journeyed
up
to
black
aspens
for
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
the
house
where
the
mystery
was
staged
if
allowed
to
enter
they
walked
about
in
admiration
or
wonder
stunning
hall
exclaimed
one
young
man
a
budding
architect
who
examined
the
old
house
with
interest
look
at
those
bronze
columns
i
never
saw
such
a
pair
i
heard
the
first
montgomery
brought
those
from
italy
or
somewhere
and
put
up
a
house
behind
volunteered
another
sightseer
ai
it
queer
the
way
they
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
front
wall
land
you
would
know
whether
you
was
going
to
school
or
coming
home
and
the
speaker
laughed
heartily
at
his
own
wit
but
at
last
the
sightseers
were
refused
admittance
to
the
house
and
the
remaining
members
of
the
party
gathered
in
conclave
to
decide
on
future
plans
professor
hardwick
was
the
one
who
showed
the
calmest
demeanour
if
there
was
a
chance
of
a
human
being
having
committed
these
crimes
he
said
i
be
the
first
one
to
want
to
track
him
down
and
send
him
straight
to
the
chair
but
nobody
who
has
thought
about
the
matter
can
present
any
theory
that
will
account
for
the
human
element
in
the
cause
of
the
tragedy
therefore
feeling
certain
as
i
do
that
our
friends
were
killed
by
supernatural
influences
i
am
ready
to
stay
here
a
short
time
longer
in
hopes
of
convincing
the
authorities
up
here
that
we
are
right
moreover
i
planned
to
stay
here
a
month
and
we
been
here
but
little
more
than
a
fortnight
i
willing
to
stay
for
the
same
reason
professor
and
eve
strange
eyes
glowed
deeply
i
too
know
that
no
living
beings
brought
about
the
deaths
of
bruce
and
little
vernie
and
i
will
stay
the
rest
of
our
proposed
month
if
the
others
will
i
am
ready
to
stay
said
milly
landon
quietly
i
gotten
all
over
my
hysterical
foolish
fears
and
i
to
stay
i
have
a
good
reason
and
if
i
had
i
be
willing
to
stay
to
keep
house
for
the
rest
of
you
let
consider
it
settled
then
said
landon
that
we
stay
a
couple
of
weeks
longer
the
astute
detective
peterson
thinks
he
can
round
up
the
villains
who
did
the
awful
things
and
if
he
can
i
ready
to
appear
against
them
we
all
ready
to
do
that
agreed
tracy
and
i
stay
a
week
or
so
but
i
want
to
get
away
by
the
middle
of
august
that
nearly
two
weeks
hence
observed
norma
i
like
to
go
home
about
that
time
too
and
all
that
to
be
discovered
which
i
suppose
will
be
nothing
ought
to
be
found
out
in
that
time
it
would
surprise
me
to
have
some
further
spiritual
manifestations
the
professor
stated
with
a
deeply
thoughtful
air
i
do
know
why
there
would
be
such
not
with
fatal
results
i
hope
and
tracy
shuddered
i
hope
not
too
and
the
professor
looked
grave
but
if
we
receive
another
warning
i
shall
go
home
at
once
i
do
think
we
will
eve
said
i
think
there
was
a
reason
for
the
wrath
of
the
phantasms
and
now
that
wrath
is
appeased
we
must
not
provoke
it
further
you
know
norma
added
the
two
who
who
died
were
scoffers
at
the
idea
of
spiritual
visitations
uncle
gif
was
said
braye
but
little
vernie
was
oh
yes
she
was
corrected
eve
she
made
fun
of
our
beliefs
all
along
and
if
she
really
made
the
ouija
write
that
message
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
it
small
wonder
that
the
vengeance
reached
her
as
well
as
bruce
who
openly
jeered
at
it
all
i
ca
think
it
mused
tracy
that
sweet
lovable
child
full
of
mischief
of
course
but
simple
harmless
mischief
but
tracy
norma
looked
and
spoke
positively
it
easier
to
think
of
a
supernatural
spirit
wanting
to
harm
the
child
than
a
living
person
what
possible
cause
could
a
human
being
have
to
wish
harm
to
little
vernie
reid
that
true
miss
cameron
but
it
inexplicable
however
you
look
at
it
at
the
same
time
braye
argued
we
must
give
both
sides
a
chance
if
there
is
any
trick
or
scheme
that
a
man
might
have
used
to
bring
about
those
deaths
at
that
moment
i
ca
conceive
of
any
but
if
there
should
have
been
such
we
must
of
course
give
all
possible
assistance
to
peterson
in
his
search
i
more
than
willing
said
tracy
i
anxious
to
help
him
for
as
you
say
braye
if
there
a
human
mind
capable
of
devising
means
to
commit
such
a
crime
it
surely
ought
to
be
within
the
province
of
some
other
human
mind
to
discover
it
suppose
we
start
out
on
that
basis
suggested
braye
i
mean
assume
that
a
live
person
did
the
deed
and
it
up
to
us
to
find
him
then
if
we
ca
do
it
fall
back
on
our
occult
theories
i
know
where
i
look
first
said
landon
grimly
where
toward
eli
stebbins
i
always
thought
he
or
the
thorpes
or
all
of
them
together
know
more
than
we
suspect
they
do
why
think
a
minute
do
you
remember
the
first
queer
inexplicable
thing
that
happened
up
here
i
do
eve
spoke
up
it
was
the
night
we
arrived
that
battered
old
candlestick
moved
itself
from
bruce
room
to
vernie
yes
eve
that
what
i
have
in
mind
well
i
thought
then
and
i
think
now
that
stebbins
moved
that
thing
himself
why
asked
several
voices
at
once
i
thought
i
saw
him
sneaking
across
the
hall
that
night
and
as
you
know
none
of
us
would
have
done
it
and
i
do
think
bruce
did
i
thought
that
at
first
but
since
bruce
death
i
know
he
never
played
any
tricks
on
us
oh
that
does
follow
objected
hardwick
i
always
suspected
bruce
would
trick
us
if
he
could
but
when
it
came
to
his
own
death
i
no
notion
that
he
compassed
that
no
agreed
braye
whatever
the
truth
may
be
there
was
no
suicide
and
so
they
talked
discussed
surmised
argued
and
theorized
without
getting
any
nearer
a
positive
belief
or
proof
of
any
sort
to
uphold
their
opinions
each
seemed
to
have
marked
out
a
certain
line
of
thought
and
doggedly
stuck
to
it
professor
hardwick
was
perhaps
the
one
most
positive
regarding
supernatural
causes
though
eve
and
norma
were
almost
equally
certain
braye
and
landon
were
not
entirely
willing
to
accept
these
beliefs
but
confessed
they
had
no
plausible
substitutes
to
suggest
tracy
as
a
clergyman
was
loth
to
accept
what
seemed
to
him
heathen
ideas
but
he
was
more
or
less
influenced
by
the
talk
of
the
professor
and
of
eve
carnforth
who
was
exceedingly
persuasive
in
manner
and
argument
milly
had
little
thought
of
her
own
about
the
matter
but
was
always
ready
to
believe
as
her
husband
did
though
she
too
was
swayed
by
the
strong
statements
and
declarations
of
eve
carnforth
but
dan
peterson
paid
no
more
heed
to
ghost
lore
of
any
sort
or
kind
than
as
if
the
words
had
not
been
spoken
miss
carnforth
glib
recital
of
wonders
she
knew
to
be
true
miss
cameron
quiet
statements
that
she
vouched
for
as
facts
the
professor
irascible
arguments
all
were
as
nothing
to
the
practical
detective
no
he
said
to
eve
it
ai
that
i
doubt
your
word
but
those
things
do
go
down
i
seen
criminals
before
try
to
get
out
by
blaming
ghosts
but
they
could
put
it
over
are
you
implying
that
one
of
us
may
be
guilty
cried
eve
really
incensed
at
the
thought
i
not
implying
anything
i
investigating
when
i
find
out
anything
i
accuse
i
wo
imply
the
man
personality
was
not
unpleasant
of
a
commonplace
type
he
went
about
his
business
cheerfully
and
in
a
practical
common
sense
fashion
he
examined
the
great
hall
where
the
deaths
had
occurred
for
a
possible
secret
entrance
nothing
doing
was
his
of
this
investigation
that
mahogany
wall
of
the
vestibule
is
as
solid
as
a
rock
and
nobody
could
get
through
those
bronze
doors
when
they
locked
and
fastened
with
those
bolts
are
you
assuming
that
some
one
entered
and
killed
the
victims
as
we
all
sat
round
drinking
tea
exclaimed
the
professor
irascibly
not
just
that
sir
returned
peterson
gravely
but
somebody
might
have
entered
in
the
night
say
and
secreted
himself
and
then
appeared
to
poison
the
cake
when
we
were
looking
jeered
london
well
and
the
detective
looked
a
little
sheepish
i
got
to
consider
all
points
you
know
and
there
do
seem
to
be
any
clues
of
any
sort
no
said
braye
no
dropped
handkerchief
or
broken
those
would
be
a
help
would
they
and
then
landon
went
on
usually
there
somebody
who
had
a
quarrel
with
the
victim
and
so
can
be
duly
suspected
but
there
nothing
of
that
sort
in
this
case
nobody
at
odds
with
bruce
was
there
asked
the
detective
hopefully
nobody
declared
landon
now
you
may
as
well
know
all
there
is
to
know
peterson
braye
here
is
the
heir
to
bruce
large
fortune
after
him
i
inherit
if
these
facts
are
of
the
nature
of
straws
to
show
you
which
way
the
wind
blows
make
the
most
of
them
but
do
it
openly
if
you
suspect
braye
or
myself
even
in
the
slightest
degree
tell
us
so
do
work
behind
our
backs
we
ready
and
willing
to
help
you
that
so
braye
rather
wynne
moreover
if
there
any
way
to
use
it
the
fortune
of
uncle
bruce
is
at
the
disposal
of
anybody
who
can
bring
the
criminal
to
justice
i
do
want
the
money
at
least
i
ca
enjoy
it
and
want
it
considering
the
way
it
has
come
to
me
i
shall
endow
a
hospital
or
something
with
it
for
truly
i
may
be
foolish
but
i
ca
seem
to
see
myself
living
luxuriously
on
money
that
has
come
to
me
as
this
has
i
do
wonder
that
to
an
outsider
it
might
look
very
much
as
if
i
had
removed
these
two
people
in
order
that
i
might
acquire
riches
or
it
would
have
looked
so
if
i
had
been
here
at
the
time
i
doubt
if
the
most
fertile
imagination
can
invent
a
way
i
could
have
been
the
criminal
when
i
was
in
east
dryden
shopping
with
mrs
landon
also
peterson
landon
resumed
remember
that
i
am
the
next
to
inherit
and
if
i
could
have
compassed
the
taking
off
of
these
two
i
could
doubtless
have
later
despatched
braye
and
so
have
come
into
the
fortune
myself
wynne
pleaded
milly
say
those
things
they
too
absurd
not
that
milly
dear
peterson
might
easily
take
up
some
such
line
of
deduction
and
while
i
willing
he
should
do
so
and
proceed
in
any
way
he
chooses
i
repeat
that
i
want
him
to
do
it
openly
and
not
try
to
convict
rudolph
or
myself
behind
our
backs
when
i
proffer
him
my
help
it
is
in
a
real
and
sincere
offer
of
assistance
and
i
want
him
to
be
equally
frank
and
outspoken
i
guess
you
pretty
safe
in
your
attitude
said
peterson
smiling
criminals
do
speak
right
out
in
meeting
like
that
and
i
suspect
you
gentlemen
if
you
heirs
to
the
property
i
think
there
others
to
be
suspected
and
i
promise
you
sir
if
i
led
toward
any
of
your
party
here
i
tell
you
what
i
up
to
that
enough
peterson
i
trust
you
to
keep
your
word
and
you
may
rely
on
us
to
help
in
any
way
we
can
and
so
life
at
black
aspens
settled
down
to
its
former
routine
at
least
in
matters
of
daily
household
affairs
but
the
actuating
principle
of
the
psychic
investigators
had
changed
those
who
thoroughly
believed
in
occultism
sought
expectantly
for
further
proofs
those
who
were
still
uncertain
awaited
developments
and
those
who
had
little
or
no
belief
in
the
supernatural
sought
some
clues
or
hints
that
might
point
to
a
human
criminal
dan
peterson
was
among
these
last
a
good
detective
though
not
of
the
transcendental
type
found
in
he
worked
diligently
at
his
problem
which
seemed
to
him
a
harder
one
than
he
had
ever
before
tackled
his
suspicions
were
all
toward
the
servants
of
the
house
and
with
these
he
included
elijah
stebbins
nor
was
he
illogical
in
his
thoughts
stebbins
was
acting
queerly
he
was
frightened
at
questions
and
was
difficult
to
get
hold
of
for
an
interview
he
answered
at
random
frequently
contradicted
himself
and
showed
a
positive
terror
of
his
own
house
since
the
tragedies
there
if
he
killed
those
two
people
with
his
own
hands
he
could
act
any
different
peterson
said
to
landon
whom
he
frequently
consulted
but
i
ca
imagine
any
way
to
connect
him
up
with
it
he
was
home
in
east
dryden
when
they
died
and
that
certain
now
if
he
could
have
made
old
thorpe
act
as
his
tool
but
lord
why
would
he
do
it
anyhow
it
too
absurd
to
think
stebbins
would
want
to
take
those
two
lives
he
wanted
you
people
should
be
scared
that
i
sure
of
he
did
all
he
could
to
scare
you
that
i
know
but
as
to
killing
any
of
you
i
sure
he
did
howsumever
somebody
committed
those
murders
and
i
going

out
who
chapter
xii
the
professor
experience
but
the
days
passed
by
and
dan
peterson
was
unable
to
make
good
his
word
everybody
outside
of
the
immediate
household
at
black
aspens
believed
the
two
mysterious
deaths
were
the
result
of
the
murderous
intent
of
one
or
more
human
beings
and
refused
absolutely
to
consider
the
spook
nonsense
offered
in
explanation
by
the
friends
and
relatives
of
the
victims
meanwhile
there
were
a
few
further
inexplicable
happenings
in
the
old
house
now
and
then
one
or
another
would
notice
the
odour
of
prussic
acid
or
would
report
a
glimpse
of
a
ghostly
figure
prowling
round
at
night
or
tell
of
hearing
low
moans
at
four
in
the
morning
but
usually
these
were
the
experiences
of
only
one
and
lacking
corroboration
could
be
set
down
to
imagination
which
was
now
especially
vivid
in
all
the
party
often
eve
or
norma
recounted
some
of
these
mysteries
but
landon
laughed
at
them
and
said
the
girls
had
been
dreaming
professor
hardwick
experienced
no
similar
illusions
though
he
longed
to
do
so
indeed
he
really
watched
and
listened
hoping
for
some
message
or
manifestation
from
his
friend
gifford
bruce
but
none
was
vouchsafed
to
him
and
though
interested
in
the
experiences
of
the
others
he
still
longed
for
a
personal
experience
and
finally
one
came
to
him
at
four
one
morning
he
lay
awake
as
often
listening
to
the
strokes
of
the
hall
clock
which
none
of
them
could
ever
hear
without
a
thrill
and
slowly
in
at
his
bedroom
door
floated
a
dim
ghostly
shape
there
was
not
sufficient
light
for
him
to
discern
more
than
the
outline
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
tall
gaunt
figure
with
a
shawl
over
its
head
nearer
to
him
the
thing
came
and
the
old
professor
felt
himself
grow
cold
with
fear
he
had
often
boasted
of
his
desire
to
see
the
ghost
and
of
his
scorn
of
fear
in
connection
therewith
but
now
that
the
spectre
had
really
appeared
to
him
the
old
man
trembled
all
over
and
tried
in
vain
to
cry
out
his
throat
contracted
his
tongue
was
powerless
and
a
sort
of
paralysis
of
terror
held
him
in
thrall
the
approaching
figure
seemed
not
to
walk
but
progressed
by
a
strange
gliding
motion
and
came
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
bed
where
the
professor
lay
shivering
with
dread
still
but
a
misty
wraith
the
awful
thing
leaned
over
the
prostrate
man
and
as
the
shawled
head
drew
near
professor
hardwick
saw
dimly
the
face
of
his
visitor
and
it
was
a
skull
the
fearsome
sight
of
hollow
and
grinning
fleshless
jaws
gave
a
sudden
strength
to
the
frightened
man
and
he
uttered
a
faint
terrorized
scream
slowly
the
spectre
raised
a
long
arm
and
hardwick
saw
a
small
glass
tumbler
in
front
of
his
face
only
for
an
instant
and
then
the
phantom
faded
away
and
vanished
into
space
again
the
professor
called
out
and
hurrying
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
hall
tracy
was
away
in
boston
and
rudolph
braye
had
gone
to
new
york
so
the
only
other
man
in
the
house
was
landon
who
came
hastily
to
the
professor
door
in
his
and
slippers
what
is
it
he
asked
did
you
call
are
you
ill
the
the
ghost
the
old
man
articulated
with
difficulty
nonsense
said
landon
you
been
dreaming
where
a
ghost
i
just
came
along
the
corridor
and
i
did
see
any
do
tell
me
i
did
see
it
babbled
the
professor
i
did
wynne
as
plain
as
i
see
you
now
landon
had
brought
his
own
bedroom
candle
and
by
its
scant
light
he
scanned
the
old
man
face
you
all
scared
up
professor
he
said
kindly
guess
i
give
you
a
nightcap
and
send
you
back
to
sleep
again
it
only
four
or
so
i
know
it
wynne
it
was
just
four
when
that
that
thing
came
i
asleep
i
have
been
for
an
hour
or
more
just
at
four
the
hall
clock
was
striking
i
saw
that
awful
thing
come
stalking
in
and
and
it
had
a
death
head
under
that
white
shawl
hold
on
there
professor
if
that
so
there
must
be
somebody
who
did
the
stalking
i
going
to
make
search
landon
called
thorpe
and
together
the
two
went
over
the
whole
house
searching
in
every
nook
and
cranny
that
could
possibly
conceal
an
intruder
but
none
was
found
every
door
and
window
was
securely
fastened
and
as
landon
had
often
observed
not
a
mouse
could
get
into
black
aspens
once
it
was
locked
up
for
the
night
nothing
doing
professor
he
reported
cheerfully
after
the
search
we
lighted
up
the
whole
place
and
we
scoured
for
burglars
or
but
nothing
human
has
entered
this
house
nor
was
your
spook
any
of
ourselves
for
milly
has
rounded
up
the
girls
and
i
made
sure
that
the
doors
that
shut
off
the
servants
quarters
have
not
been
opened
now
what
have
you
to
say
only
that
i
saw
the
thing
the
professor
had
pulled
himself
together
and
i
not
prepared
to
say
whether
i
think
it
was
a
phantom
or
a
person
pretending
to
be
one
you
sure
about
the
servants
absolutely
they
could
get
through
what
about
stebbins
could
he
have
been
concealed
in
the
house
all
night
no
and
if
he
had
how
could
he
have
got
out
all
the
doors
and
windows
are
locked
on
the
inside
just
as
they
been
all
night
he
lock
them
behind
him
thorpe
could
let
him
in
and
out
if
he
wanted
to
into
the
back
part
of
the
house
but
thorpe
himself
ca
get
into
the
main
house
the
rooms
that
we
use
after
i
lock
the
doors
between
come
now
professor
you
know
all
that
as
well
as
i
do
either
you
dreamed
your
ghost
or
it
the
real
thing
this
time
take
your
choice
landon
was
so
cheerful
and
took
the
thing
so
lightly
that
hardwick
began
to
feel
more
at
ease
and
recounted
his
story
in
further
detail
it
was
the
real
thing
he
concluded
i
wish
rudolph
or
tracy
had
been
here
they
sleep
in
this
wing
and
they
would
have
come
to
me
more
quickly
than
you
did
wynne
i
came
the
moment
i
heard
you
call
at
least
as
soon
as
i
could
slip
into
a
bathrobe
i
know
you
did
and
it
would
have
mattered
that
thing
did
walk
away
down
the
corridor
you
know
it
just
faded
away
vanished
into
the
air
i
could
see
it
how
could
you
with
no
light
i
do
know
how
i
did
it
was
exactly
luminous
and
yet
it
gave
out
a
very
faint
glow
enough
for
me
to
see
it
anyhow
oh
i
shall
never
forget
its
awful
grin
professor
hardwick
told
his
tale
to
eve
and
norma
later
in
the
day
and
in
the
afternoon
the
men
returned
tracy
said
he
had
been
to
boston
to
see
the
trustees
of
a
church
that
had
called
him
to
its
pastorate
and
braye
had
been
in
new
york
looking
after
some
of
his
late
business
affairs
both
men
were
deeply
interested
in
the
story
of
the
ghost
for
as
they
said
professor
hardwick
was
not
one
to
imagine
or
to
think
himself
awake
when
he
was
dreaming
they
listened
attentively
and
tracy
summed
it
up
by
saying
well
if
professor
hardwick
saw
that
it
makes
me
feel
like
believing
in
the
supernatural
me
too
agreed
braye
i
do
take
much
stock
in
the
stories
of
the
girls
for
eve
is
a
visionary
creature
and
norma
is
very
imaginative
but
when
a
rational
scientific
man
sees
things
i
believe
the
things
are
there
to
be
seen
at
least
i
willing
to
believe
i
would
feel
more
certain
if
i
saw
it
myself
and
yet
to
tell
the
truth
i
no
desire
to
see
it
i
take
other
people
words
for
it
how
about
you
tracy
i
do
believe
i
psychic
or
sensitive
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
the
clergyman
smiled
you
know
i
slept
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
but
no
ghostly
visitor
favoured
me
it
may
come
to
you
yet
said
hardwick
turning
grave
eyes
on
tracy
or
you
either
rudolph
you
see
it
does
visit
that
room
i
wish
some
of
you
others
could
see
it
i
feel
more
sure
of
my
own
story
are
you
sure
of
it
asked
tracy
what
do
you
mean
by
sure
queried
the
professor
a
little
petulantly
of
course
i
sure
i
saw
what
i
told
you
but
i
want
to
be
sure
it
a
ghost
and
not
a
person
tricking
me
could
it
have
been
miss
carnforth
now
no
it
was
declared
landon
milly
went
to
the
girls
as
i
went
to
you
professor
and
found
them
both
asleep
or
at
least
they
were
dozing
but
they
were
safely
in
their
beds
you
know
we
all
more
or
less
wakeful
at
four
four
is
a
more
fatal
time
said
braye
musingly
the
whole
thing
is
frightful
i
for
going
back
to
new
york
as
soon
as
we
can
if
this
should
be
the
eleventh
case
began
the
professor
what
do
you
mean
the
eleventh
case
asked
tracy
as
i
told
these
people
before
we
started
up
here
andrew
lang
has
said
in
one
of
his
books
that
ten
out
of
every
eleven
cases
of
supernatural
manifestations
are
produced
by
fraud
when
i
said
that
miss
carnforth
very
astutely
said
that
it
was
the
eleventh
case
that
was
of
interest
to
investigators
and
i
agreed
if
this
now
is
the
eleventh
case
i
do
mean
only
my
experience
of
last
night
but
all
our
experiences
up
here
if
this
is
the
eleventh
case
that
is
the
result
of
fraud
and
it
certainly
looks
like
it
why
then
we
have
something
worth
investigating
not
at
the
cost
of
any
more
lives
said
braye
sternly
if
it
is
the
eleventh
case
and
if
it
is
going
right
on
being
an
eleventh
case
had
enough
of
it
perhaps
that
apparition
of
a
glass
in
the
hand
foretells
tragedy
to
you
professor
braye
spoke
gloomily
rather
than
as
an
alarmist
but
the
professor
turned
white
i
thought
of
that
he
said
in
a
low
voice
why
i
want
to
be
sure
the
phantom
was
a
real
one
if
it
was
fraud
i
have
no
fear
but
if
it
was
really
the
disembodied
spirit
of
that
shawled
woman
appearing
in
her
own
materialized
skeleton
i
too
have
had
about
enough
investigating
what
do
you
think
norma
braye
asked
of
the
girl
as
later
in
the
afternoon
they
were
walking
round
along
the
wild
path
that
was
the
only
approach
to
the
great
portals
of
black
aspens
i
do
know
rudolph
but
i
beginning
to
think
there
a
human
hand
and
brain
back
of
it
all
i
a
sensitive
and
that
one
reason
why
these
things
appeal
to
me
as
supernatural
i
had
more
or
less
experience
with
supernormal
matters
and
i
never
known
anything
like
the
things
that
have
happened
and
are
happening
up
here
whom
do
you
suspect
norma
tell
me
for
i
too
think
there
may
be
some
trickery
and
i
wonder
if
we
look
in
the
same
direction
i
do
want
even
to
hint
it
rudolph
but
do
hesitate
to
tell
me
dear
oh
that
slipped
out
i
no
right
to
say
to
you
but
norma
after
we
get
back
to
town
after
these
horrors
are
farther
in
the
past
may
i
tell
you
then
what
i
hope
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
do
do
say
such
things
and
a
pained
look
came
into
the
blue
eyes
you
know
you
are
not
free
to
talk
like
that
not
free
why
am
i
not
what
do
you
mean
you
know
you
must
know
eve
told
me
eve
could
have
told
you
that
there
was
anything
between
her
and
me
why
norma
i
have
loved
you
from
the
very
first
moment
i
laid
eyes
on
you
i
have
kept
myself
from
telling
you
because
of
all
these
dreadful
things
that
have
been
going
on
this
atmosphere
is
no
place
for
but
dearest
just
give
me
a
gleam
of
hope
that
later
when
we
go
back
home
that
i
may
oh
rudolph
look
what
is
that
see
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
they
had
neared
the
house
on
their
return
stroll
and
from
the
window
of
the
fatal
room
peered
out
at
them
a
ghastly
grinning
skull
it
was
nearly
dusk
but
they
could
see
quite
clearly
the
hollow
and
the
awful
teeth
of
the
fleshless
face
norma
clung
to
braye
almost
fainting
he
slipped
an
arm
round
her
saying
brace
up
norma
dearest
be
brave
this
is
our
chance
let
us
dash
right
in
and
see
if
it
is
still
there
stay
here
if
you
prefer
but
i
must
go
he
hastened
toward
the
house
and
norma
kept
pace
with
him
she
felt
imbued
with
his
spirit
of
courage
and
bravery
and
together
they
hurried
and
burst
in
at
the
front
door
which
was
never
locked
save
at
night
without
stopping
braye
rushed
into
the
room
with
the
tassels
but
there
was
no
one
there
and
no
sign
of
any
occupant
either
human
or
supernatural
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
and
further
search
showed
no
one
in
the
drawing
room
nor
could
anything
unusual
be
found
in
the
house
most
of
the
people
were
in
their
rooms
eve
was
partly
ill
with
a
headache
and
milly
was
looking
after
her
the
men
appeared
as
braye
and
norma
called
out
and
soon
all
had
gathered
to
hear
the
strange
new
story
i
should
believe
it
if
you
had
both
seen
it
said
the
professor
but
i
ca
think
you
were
under
the
spell
of
imagination
i
want
to
go
home
milly
said
plaintively
i
do
want
to
see
the
thing
and
i
afraid
i
be
the
next
one
it
will
visit
we
will
go
dear
said
landon
as
soon
as
we
can
make
arrangements
we
get
off
do
you
say
so
eve
yes
she
assented
but
slowly
i
would
prefer
to
stay
a
bit
longer
myself
but
i
really
do
think
milly
ought
to
however
i
do
as
the
majority
wish
but
the
matter
of
going
away
from
black
aspens
was
not
entirely
at
their
own
disposal
the
detective
dan
peterson
had
been
exceedingly
busy
and
had
wrung
a
confession
out
of
elijah
stebbins
it
had
been
a
mild
sort
of
third
degree
but
it
had
resulted
in
a
frank
avowal
of
implication
in
some
at
least
of
the
mysterious
happenings
that
had
puzzled
the
people
at
black
aspens
stebbins
defended
himself
by
the
statement
that
he
only
rented
his
house
on
the
understanding
that
it
was
haunted
he
said
it
was
reputed
haunted
but
he
knew
that
unless
something
mysterious
occurred
the
tenants
would
feel
dissatisfied
he
said
too
that
he
saw
no
harm
in
doing
a
few
little
tricks
to
mystify
and
interest
the
investigators
but
he
swore
that
he
had
no
hand
in
the
spectral
appearances
nor
in
the
awful
tragedy
of
the
four
tea
what
he
did
confess
to
was
the
placing
of
the
old
battered
candlestick
in
miss
reid
room
the
first
night
the
party
arrived
i
done
it
sort
of
on
impulse
he
said
i
heard
talking
about
ghosts
and
just
to
amaze
them
i
sneaked
in
in
the
night
and
took
that
candlestick
offen
bruce
dresser
and
set
it
on
the
young
lady
i
did
mean
any
harm
only
to
stir
things
up
which
you
did
remarked
peterson
drily
go
on
the
confession
was
being
recorded
in
the
presence
of
police
officials
and
stebbins
was
practically
under
arrest
or
would
be
very
shortly
after
his
tale
was
told
well
then
the
first
night
bruce
slept
in
that
room
that
room
i
thought
i
wrap
a
sheet
round
me
and
give
him
a
little
scare
he
was
so
scornful
o
ghosts
you
know
an
i
did
but
nobody
would
believe
his
yarn
so
that
all
i
did
if
any
more
of
them
ghost
performances
was
cut
up
by
live
people
they
was
me
somebody
else
did
it
and
no
amount
of
further
coercion
could
budge
stebbins
from
these
statements
he
stuck
to
it
that
though
he
had
tricked
his
tenants
he
had
done
nothing
to
harm
them
and
his
intentions
were
of
the
best
as
he
merely
wanted
to
give
them
what
they
had
taken
his
house
for
you
intended
to
keep
it
up
asked
peterson
yes
i
did
but
after
they
took
things
into
their
own
hands
and
played
spooks
themselves
what
was
the
use
how
did
you
get
into
the
house
at
night
when
it
was
so
securely
locked
asked
peterson
i
managed
it
but
i
wo
tell
you
how
said
stebbins
doggedly
with
thorpe
help
suggested
peterson
or
oh
by
jinks
he
whistled
i
think
i
begin
to
see
a
glimmer
of
a
gleam
of
light
on
this
mystery
yes
i
sure
do
excuse
me
and
i
fly
over
to
the
house
and
do
a
little
questioning
officer
keep
friend
stebbins
safe
against
my
return
arrived
at
black
aspens
peterson
asked
for
rudolph
braye
and
was
closeted
with
him
for
a
secret
session
from
which
braye
came
forth
looking
greatly
worried
and
perturbed
peterson
went
away
and
braye
sought
the
others
he
found
them
listening
to
a
letter
which
professor
hardwick
had
just
received
and
which
the
old
man
was
reading
aloud
it
from
mr
wise
he
said
to
braye
as
the
latter
came
in
hearing
he
a
detective
and
he
writes
to
me
asking
permission
to
take
up
this
case
what
a
strange
thing
to
do
exclaimed
braye
yes
agreed
hardwick
and
he
seems
to
be
a
strange
man
listen
i
succeed
in
finding
a
true
solution
to
the
mystery
you
may
pay
me
whatever
you
deem
the
matter
worth
if
i
do
not
there
will
be
no
charge
of
any
sort
except
that
i
should
wish
to
live
in
the
house
with
you
all
at
black
aspens
i
know
all
of
the
affair
that
has
been
printed
in
the
newspapers
and
no
more
if
you
are
still
in
the
dark
i
should
like
prodigiously
to
get
into
the
thick
of
it
and
will
arrive
as
soon
as
you
summon
me
there
was
more
to
the
letter
but
that
was
the
gist
of
it
and
braye
listened
in
silence
i
think
he
said
as
the
professor
finished
that
we
do
want
that
detective
poking
into
our
affairs
i
agree
said
landon
there
been
quite
enough
publicity
about
all
this
already
and
i
for
one
prefer
to
go
back
to
new
york
and
forget
it
as
soon
as
we
can
we
ca
forget
it
very
soon
wynne
put
in
milly
but
i
too
want
to
go
back
to
new
york
we
ca
go
right
off
braye
told
them
we
must
wait
a
week
or
so
at
least
why
asked
eve
not
at
all
displeased
by
this
statement
for
she
frankly
admitted
a
desire
to
stay
longer
at
black
aspens
oh
lots
of
reasons
braye
put
her
off
but
let
settle
down
for
another
week
here
and
then
we
see
then
i
going
to
tell
wise
to
come
up
for
that
week
declared
the
professor
i
do
altogether
adhere
to
my
conviction
as
to
supernatural
powers
and
i
want
to
see
what
a
big
really
clever
detective
can
dig
up
in
the
way
of
clues
or
evidence
or
whatever
they
work
by
oh
cut
out
wise
urged
braye
we
do
want
any
more
detectives
than
we
are
ourselves
and
peterson
is
pretty
busy
just
now
too
it
was
after
the
confab
broke
up
that
milly
went
to
braye
why
do
you
want
mr
wise
to
come
she
said
without
preamble
why

he
stammered
in
an
embarrassed
way

agonized

i
heard
him
say
that
he
thinks

and
that

two
of
them
brought
about
all
the
mysterious
doings

chapter
xiii
pennington
wise
when
mary
pennington
married
a
man
named
wise
it
was
not
at
all
an
unusual
impulse
that
prompted
her
to
name
her
first
born
son
after
her
own
family
name
and
so
pennington
wise
came
into
being
then
of
course
it
followed
as
the
night
the
day
that
his
school
chums
should
call
him
penny
wise
which
name
stuck
to
him
through
life
whether
this
significant
name
was
the
cause
of
his
becoming
a
detective
is
not
definitely
known
but
a
detective
he
did
grow
up
to
be
and
a
good
one
too
eccentric
of
course
what
worthwhile
detective
is
not
but
clear
cut
of
brain
mind
and
intelligence
and
always
on
the
lookout
for
an
interesting
case
for
he
would
engage
in
no
others
wherefore
his
persistence
in
desiring
to
investigate
the
strange
mysteries
of
black
aspens
won
the
day
against
milly
endeavours
to
prevent
his
coming
she
had
done
all
she
could
and
most
of
the
house
party
had
aided
her
efforts
but
professor
hardwick
had
become
imbued
with
the
idea
that
there
was
human
agency
at
work
and
that
his
belief
in
spiritual
visitation
honest
though
it
had
been
was
doomed
to
a
speedy
death
unless
further
proof
could
be
shown
norma
too
was
rather
inclined
to
welcome
a
specialist
in
the
solving
of
mysterious
problems
and
in
conference
with
the
professor
agreed
to
do
all
she
could
to
help
the
wise
man
in
his
work
norma
was
still
of
the
opinion
that
the
two
tragic
deaths
were
the
work
of
evil
spirits
but
if
it
were
not
so
she
wanted
to
know
it
but
the
principal
reason
why
pennington
wise
came
to
black
aspens
was
his
own
determination
to
do
so
he
had
never
heard
of
such
an
unusual
and
weird
mystery
and
it
whetted
his
curiosity
by
its
strange
and
almost
unbelievable
details
the
opposing
party
gave
in
gracefully
when
they
found
his
advent
was
inevitable
all
but
milly
that
is
she
spent
her
time
alternately
crying
her
heart
out
in
wynne
arms
and
bracing
herself
up
for
a
calm
and
indifferent
attitude
before
the
new
investigator
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
braye
advised
her
remember
not
to
give
out
any
information
milly
let
him
find
out
all
he
can
but
do
help
him
all
right
rudolph
and
anyway
i
know
wynne
is
innocent
of
course
he
is
that
goes
without
saying
but
if
he
is
suspected
say
if
stebbins
or
thorpe
or
anybody
else
puts
wise
up
to
suspicion
it
may
mean
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
for
all
of
us
so
just
be
quiet
dignified
and
all
that
but
do
say
anything
definite
for
it
might
be
misconstrued
and
misunderstood
and
make
trouble
at
least
that
the
course
i
going
to
pursue
and
i
think
it
the
best
plan
oh
i
know
it
is
milly
agreed
in
fact
that
just
about
what
wynne
told
me
he
thinks
if
i
try
to
help
i
only
make
mistakes
so
he
too
told
me
to
keep
quiet
eve
is
awfully
angry
because
that
man
is
coming
she
not
saying
so
but
i
know
her
and
rudolph
she
afraid
of
something
i
do
know
what
exactly
but
she
fearfully
afraid
of
developments
we
all
are
milly
if
the
detective
pins
it
on
any
human
being
that
means
trouble
and
if
he
decides
it
spooks
after
all
i
think
i
be
more
afraid
of
them
than
ever
i
ca
be
any
more
afraid
of
them
than
i
am
milly
shuddered
oh
rudolph
how
i
wish
we
had
never
come
up
here
we
all
wish
that
milly
but
as
we
in
for
it
now
we
must
see
it
through
pennington
wise
arrived
the
next
afternoon
he
came
into
the
hall
like
an
army
with
banners
a
tall
well
man
of
about
or
four
thick
chestnut
hair
worn
à
la
brosse
clear
blue
eyes
a
face
and
a
manner
that
proclaimed
generalship
and
efficiency
to
the
last
degree
here
i
am
he
announced
setting
down
several
pieces
of
hand
luggage
and
whipping
off
his
soft
gray
felt
hat
you
are
the
hostess
his
eyes
had
picked
out
milly
and
he
greeted
her
as
a
distinguished
visitor
might
who
is
that
exclaimed
milly
looking
at
a
slight
girl
who
followed
quietly
in
wise
footsteps
that
oh
that
zizi
part
of
my
luggage
put
her
any
place
is
there
a
housekeeper
person
yes
well
turn
zizi
over
to
her
she
be
all
right
hester
was
peeping
in
at
a
rear
door
unable
to
restrain
her
curiosity
as
to
the
commotion
and
zizi
glided
toward
her
and
disappeared
in
the
shadows
now
said
wise
his
quick
smile
flashing
inclusively
at
all
of
them
we
must
get
acquainted
i
penny
wise
and
all
possible
jokes
on
my
name
have
already
been
made
so
that
all
right
i
know
landon
and
you
of
course
looking
at
wynne
are
her
husband
professor
hardwick
and
he
bowed
slightly
is
the
man
with
whom
i
have
had
a
short
correspondence
regarding
my
coming
here
you
sir
he
looked
inquiringly
at
braye
i
rudolph
braye
nephew
of
gifford
bruce
and
present
heir
to
his
fortune
the
quiet
sadness
of
braye
tone
precluded
any
idea
of
his
triumph
of
exultation
at
the
fact
he
stated
this
he
went
on
is
the
reverend
tracy
a
friend
of
us
all
and
these
ladies
are
miss
carnforth
and
miss
cameron
both
deeply
interested
in
the
solution
of
the
mysteries
that
confront
us
since
introductions
are
in
order
may
i
inquire
further
concerning
the
young
lady
or
child
who
accompanied
you
zizi
she
part
of
my
working
outfit
in
fact
one
of
my
principal
bits
of
paraphernalia
i
always
use
her
on
mysterious
cases
do
look
on
her
as
an
individual
please
she
a
property
in
the
theatrical
sense
i
mean
but
her
standing
in
the
household
asked
milly
does
she
belong
with
the
servants
or
in
here
with
us
she
look
after
that
herself
and
penny
wise
smiled
pay
no
more
attention
to
her
than
you
would
to
my
umbrella
or
walking
stick
now
we
know
each
others
names
let
proceed
to
the
case
itself
who
is
going
to
tell
me
all
about
it
which
of
us
would
you
rather
have
do
so
asked
eve
her
long
glittering
eyes
fixed
on
the
detective
face
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
and
then
let
his
gaze
continue
to
rest
on
her
beautiful
sibylline
countenance
not
you
he
said
you
are
too
well
i
suppose
the
word
i
must
use
is
temperamental
but
it
a
word
i
hate
why
asked
the
professor
what
do
you
mean
by
temperamental
that
the
trouble
smiled
wise
it
does
mean
anything
strictly
speaking
every
one
has
temperament
of
one
sort
or
another
but
it
has
come
to
mean
an
emotional
temperament
what
do
you
mean
by
emotional
interrupted
hardwick
there
you
go
again
and
wise
looked
amused
emotions
are
of
all
sorts
but
emotional
has
come
to
be
used
only
in
reference
to
demonstrations
of
the
affections
you
a
scholar
cried
the
professor
rarely
do
i
meet
a
man
with
such
a
fine
sense
of
terminology
glad
you
pleased
but
professor
neither
do
i
choose
you
as
historian
of
the
affairs
of
black
aspens
let
me
see
his
eyes
roved
from
one
to
another
it
seems
to
me
i
get
the
most
straightforward
uncoloured
statement
from
a
clerical
mind
i
think
tracy
can
tell
me
in
the
way
i
want
to
hear
it
a
concise
story
of
the
mysteries
and
tragedies
you
have
been
through
up
here
tracy
looked
at
the
detective
gravely
i
am
quite
willing
to
do
what
i
can
he
said
and
i
will
tell
the
happenings
as
i
know
them
for
occasions
when
i
was
not
present
or
where
my
memory
fails
the
others
will
i
trust
be
allowed
to
help
me
out
and
then
the
whole
matter
was
laid
before
the
intelligence
of
pennington
wise
and
with
a
rapt
look
of
interest
and
a
few
pointed
questions
here
and
there
the
detective
listened
to
the
history
of
his
new
case
at
last
the
account
having
been
brought
up
to
date
wise
nodded
his
head
and
sat
silent
for
a
moment
it
was
not
the
melodramatic
silence
of
one
affecting
superiority
but
the
more
impressive
quietude
of
a
mind
really
in
deep
thought
then
wise
said
simply
i
heard
nothing
yet
to
make
me
assume
any
supernatural
agency
you
zizi
no
came
a
soft
thin
voice
from
the
shadowy
depths
of
the
rear
hall
milly
jumped
has
she
been
there
all
the
time
she
said
she
always
there
returned
wise
in
a
way
now
ready
to
declare
that
the
deaths
of
your
two
friends
are
positively
not
due
to
spiritistic
wills
but
are
dastardly
murders
cleverly
accomplished
by
human
hands
and
human
brains
how
gasped
eve
carnforth
she
was
leaning
forward
her
beryl
eyes
dilated
and
staring
her
hands
clenched
her
slender
form
trembling
with
excitement
that
i
do
not
know
yet
do
you
zizi
no
came
tranquilly
from
the
distance
let
that
girl
come
here
cried
milly
pettishly
it
gets
on
my
nerves
to
have
her
speaking
from
way
back
there
come
here
zizi
directed
penny
wise
and
the
slim
young
figure
glided
toward
them
she
was
a
mere
slip
of
a
girl
a
wisp
of
humanity
in
a
flimsy
frock
of
thin
black
stuff
with
a
touch
of
chiffon
in
bodice
and
sash
the
skirt
was
short
and
her
black
silk
stockings
and
pumps
gave
her
a
chic
air
her
black
hair
was
drawn
smoothly
back
in
the
prevailing
mode
and
though
she
had
an
air
of
she
was
inconspicuous
in
effect
without
a
glance
at
the
people
personally
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
a
little
apart
yet
in
full
view
of
all
wise
paid
no
attention
to
her
and
went
on
thoughtfully
no
there
is
no
evidence
pointing
to
the
occult
but
innumerable
straws
to
show
which
way
the
camel
back
is
to
be
broken
mr
wise
said
eve
determinedly
i
do
think
it
is
fair
for
you
to
hear
the
story
only
from
tracy
i
think
he
is
opposed
to
a
belief
in
psychics
and
so
unintentionally
colours
his
narrative
to
lead
away
from
such
theories
that
may
be
so
said
tracy
himself
looking
thoughtfully
at
eve
and
i
agree
it
would
be
fairer
to
hear
the
story
or
parts
of
it
retold
by
miss
carnforth
or
some
one
who
fully
believes
in
spiritism
right
said
wise
go
ahead
miss
carnforth
tell
me
anything
that
seems
to
you
different
in
meaning
from
what
tracy
has
described
quite
willing
eve
told
of
the
ghostly
visitant
that
had
appeared
to
her
the
night
she
slept
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
and
then
described
vividly
the
ghost
that
had
appeared
to
vernie
as
vernie
had
told
it
to
her
you
see
she
concluded
there
is
no
explanation
for
these
things
other
than
supernatural
for
the
locks
and
bars
on
the
house
preclude
intrusion
of
outsiders
and
all
the
occupants
of
the
house
are
accounted
for
i
tell
you
the
things
just
as
they
happened
with
no
wish
to
be
discourteous
miss
carnforth
i
would
advise
you
to
tell
those
tales
to
the
submarines
even
the
marines
could
swallow
those
could
they
zizi
no
and
now
that
they
could
see
the
girl
all
noticed
a
slight
smile
of
amusement
on
her
young
face
it
was
quickly
followed
by
a
look
of
horror
in
her
black
eyes
as
she
murmured
what
awful
frights
you
must
have
had
and
she
glanced
at
milly
in
sympathy
then
she
turned
toward
norma
and
seemed
about
to
speak
but
thought
better
of
it
not
looking
toward
his
property
wise
went
on
talking
i
can
readily
see
how
any
one
willing
to
believe
in
the
occult
could
turn
these
weird
happenings
into
plausible
proof
but
it
is
not
so
miss
carnforth
own
story
convinces
me
even
more
strongly
that
there
has
been
diabolical
cleverness
used
but
by
a
human
being
not
a
phantom
and
you
will
discover
how
you
will
solve
the
mysteries
asked
the
professor
eagerly
i
hope
to
but
it
is
the
most
difficult
appearing
case
i
have
ever
encountered
it
is
not
an
eleventh
case
then
and
professor
hardwick
told
again
of
andrew
lang
percentage
of
proof
no
it
is
not
it
is
one
of
the
ten
that
are
the
result
of
fraud
now
to
find
the
perpetrator
of
the
fraud
at
least
you
must
admit
mr
wise
said
eve
a
little
spitefully
that
your
saying
it
is
a
case
of
fraud
does
not
make
it
so
no
agreed
wise
smiling
in
an
exasperatingly
patronizing
way
it
sure
does
not
in
fact
it
has
already
made
itself
so
and
your
discovery
of
the
means
used
is
bound
to
come
asked
tracy
with
interest
bound
to
come
repeated
the
detective
but
do
let
us
begin
by
being
at
odds
with
each
other
i
came
here
to
discover
the
truth
if
any
one
wants
the
truth
to
remain
undiscovered
now
is
the
time
to
say
so
for
it
will
soon
be
too
late
why
should
any
one
want
the
truth
to
remain
undiscovered
said
braye
abruptly
for
two
reasons
replied
wise
seriously
first
any
one
criminally
implicated
might
wish
it
to
remain
unknown
second
any
one
wishing
to
shield
another
might
also
wish
no
discoveries
made
but
you
do
think
any
of
us
are
criminally
implicated
i
hope
and
braye
looked
questioning
there
are
others
in
this
house
beside
you
people
wise
returned
and
i
tell
you
frankly
i
not
ready
yet
to
suspect
any
one
or
even
imagine
who
the
criminal
may
be
i
only
state
positively
that
disembodied
spirits
are
not
responsible
for
those
two
tragic
deaths
also
may
i
ask
you
to
remember
that
i
only
just
arrived
that
i
had
a
tiresome
journey
that
i
like
rest
and
refreshment
and
that
there
are
more
days
coming
for
my
further
work
why
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
the
professor
that
all
true
do
you
know
mr
wise
it
seems
as
if
you
always
been
here
it
seems
as
if
you
were
already
one
of
us
thank
you
sir
that
a
pleasant
compliment
to
my
personality
anyway
and
now
if
you
please
landon
may
i
be
shown
to
my
room
certainly
said
milly
and
she
rang
for
thorpe
as
landon
rose
to
escort
the
guest
himself
where
that
girl
said
norma
looking
round
after
the
detective
had
gone
off
what
became
of
her
but
there
was
no
sight
of
the
little
figure
oh
let
her
alone
said
eve
she
slid
out
to
the
kitchen
i
think
hester
will
look
after
her
that
man
said
to
pay
no
more
attention
to
her
than
to
his
hand
luggage
she
look
out
for
herself
i
no
doubt
is
she
awful
anyway
i
think
she
pretty
said
norma
in
a
weird
elfin
sort
of
way
she
knows
it
all
said
braye
i
never
saw
such
an
effect
of
old
head
on
young
shoulders
in
my
life
but
what
a
funny
way
to
treat
her
she
a
spy
declared
eve
that
what
she
is
a
spy
with
her
silent
gliding
ways
and
her
sly
soft
voice
i
hate
her
now
now
evie
do
be
unjust
and
braye
smiled
at
her
she
is
a
bit
your
style
and
temperament
but
do
be
jealous
nonsense
and
eve
laughed
back
at
him
why
she
is
a
bit
like
me
she
has
black
hair
and
eyes
i
did
notice
said
braye
but
she
impressed
me
as
being
like
you
in
lines
and
motions
a
pocket
edition
laughed
tracy
miss
carnforth
would
make
two
of
that
little
shrimp
and
miss
carnforth
is
a
sylph
herself
the
party
broke
up
into
smaller
groups
and
braye
and
norma
sauntered
off
for
their
usual
afternoon
stroll
eve
watched
them
go
her
eyes
moodily
staring
wo
i
do
said
tracy
quiet
voice
and
eve
pulled
herself
together
and
smiled
at
him
you
the
one
i
want
most
she
declared
gaily
unwilling
to
be
thought
disappointed
let
walk
down
by
the
lake
the
walk
by
the
lake
was
always
shaded
but
as
the
day
was
murky
it
was
gloomier
than
ever
you
like
this
place
asked
tracy
with
a
glance
at
the
black
grove
of
aspens
and
their
dark
reflection
in
the
still
water
of
the
deep
pool
yes
i
do
or
i
did
until
that
man
came
up
here
there
no
use
in
pursuing
our
investigations
with
him
around
all
the
more
use
declared
tracy
if
any
supernatural
things
happen
it
will
refute
his
cocksure
decisions
yes
it
would
oh
i
do
wish
a
ghost
would
appear
to
him
and
scare
him
out
of
his
wits
he
has
plenty
of
wits
miss
carnforth
and
he
take
some
scaring
i
think
but
if
a
real
phantasm
came
he
know
it
and
he
acknowledge
it
i
sure
he
strikes
me
as
an
honourable
man
and
a
decent
straightforward
sort
if
he
is
and
eve
ruminated
perhaps
he
can
help
us
to
investigate
that
what
he
here
for
i
mean
investigate
beliefs
if
he
could
be
convinced
as
we
are
of
the
existence
of
phantoms
and
of
their
visitations
he
be
a
splendid
help
would
he
perhaps
i
am
in
wrong
in
disliking
him
you
certainly
premature
why
not
one
man
out
of
a
thousand
does
believe
in
the
occult
and
not
one
in
a
million
detectives
i
daresay
meantime
braye
and
norma
were
talking
in
like
vein
i
do
believe
it
was
a
spirit
that
killed
our
dear
vernie
and
bruce
norma
declared
but
if
mr
wise
can
prove
the
contrary
we
want
him
to
do
so
do
we
rudolph
of
course
norma
we
all
feel
that
way
i
especially
for
as
heir
to
uncle
gif
money
i
in
a
peculiar
position
but
if
anybody
can
get
at
the
truth
this
wise
person
can
he
a
live
wire
i
can
see
that
shall
we
help
him
rudolph
or
hold
back
and
let
him
work
alone
help
him
of
course
why
not
but
be
careful
that
it
is
help
we
offer
him
and
not
merely
stupid
interference
what
do
you
mean
by
that
nothing
particular
but
some
of
us
are
inclined
to
be
a
bit
officious
and
oh
i
do
know
norma
i
do
want
to
say
anything
even
to
you
let
talk
of
pleasanter
subjects
what
for
instance
you
for
instance
you
enchanting
in
that
pale
blue
gown
it
makes
you
look
like
an
angel
do
they
wear
pale
blue
i
do
know
what
they
wear
and
sha
care
until
you
really
are
one
and
then
i
hope
i
be
one
too
but
you
look
like
an
angel
because

answer

could
get
chapter
xiv
zizi
where
is
she
milly
asked
of
hester
as
more
out
of
curiosity
than
hospitality
she
went
to
the
kitchen
well
mis
landon
i
never
see
such
a
thing
in
all
my
born
days
she
slid
out
here
like
she
was
on
she
says
smilin
and
with
that
she
settled
herself
for
good
and
all
she
been
born
an
brought
up
here
she
slid
to
the
cupboard
and
picked
out
the
tea
caddy
and
took
down
a
little
teapot
and
in
a
jiffy
she
snatched
up
the
teakettle
and
was
settin
at
that
there
table
drinkin
her
tea
i
got
her
out
some
cakes
and
by
then
she
was
bread
butter
never
i
seen
her
like
did
she
trouble
you
land
no
she
waits
on
herself
but
so
quick
you
think
she
was
a
witch
where
is
she
now
well
she
finished
her
tea
and
then
she
fair
scooted
up
the
back
stairs
i
heard
her
dart
into
one
or
two
rooms
and
then
she
took
the
little
south
gable
room
for
hers
i
could
hear
her
stepping
about
putting
her
things
away
i
make
no
doubt
she
looked
in
here
again
a
minute
and
said
chosen
that
little
room
with
the
lattice
wall
paper
and
then
she
disappeared
again
that
all
i
know
about
her
no
she
do
trouble
me
none
and
i
do
say
i
do
sort
o
take
to
her
but
she
a
queer
little
piece
she
is
that
milly
sighed
every
thing
queer
hester
she
said
broodingly
and
then
she
went
back
to
the
hall
wynne
landon
sat
there
alone
his
face
was
grave
and
he
sighed
deeply
as
his
wife
came
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
where
everybody
wynnsie
she
said
cheerily
traipsing
over
the
house
hunting
clues
rotten
business
milly
why
what
do
you
mean
by
that
nothing
i
hope
if
that
man
is
going
to
find
the
criminal
he
make
short
work
of
it
so
do
i
dear
then
we
can
go
home
ca
we
you
bet
here
they
are
now
they
seem
in
good
spirits
the
crowd
came
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
great
hall
laughing
at
some
quip
of
wise
ever
since
the
day
of
the
two
deaths
a
sombre
gloom
had
pervaded
the
whole
place
and
smiles
had
been
few
the
sound
of
laughter
came
as
a
shock
to
the
landons
but
the
cheery
face
of
penny
wise
betokened
only
wholesome
good
nature
and
not
flippant
heartlessness
old
montgomery
knew
how
to
build
a
house
he
commented
looking
at
the
finely
curving
staircase
and
its
elaborate
balusters
living
rooms
nowadays
are
all
very
well
but
these
great
entrance
halls
are
finer
places
to
congregate
you
spend
much
of
your
time
here
i
sure
the
worst
part
is
they
difficult
to
light
properly
by
daylight
i
mean
and
you
no
electrics
here
have
you
no
replied
landon
only
kerosene
and
candles
you
see
the
place
has
been
unoccupied
for
years
haunted
houses
are
apt
to
be
reputed
haunted
houses
corrected
the
professor
there
are
no
others
and
wise
grinned
all
reputed
haunted
houses
have
nothing
to
haunt
them
but
their
repute
i
mean
the
story
of
their
ghost
is
all
the
ghost
they
have
but
i
the
ghost
here
and
eve
spoke
with
a
quiet
dignity
that
defied
contradiction
of
course
you
did
wise
assented
the
ghost
came
purposely
to
be
seen
did
you
ever
see
one
mr
wise
i
never
did
miss
carnforth
i
never
hope
to
see
one
but
i
can
tell
you
anyhow
i
rather
see
than
be
one
oh
of
course
if
you
going
to
take
that
tone
and
eve
turned
away
decidedly
offended
sorry
and
wise
flashed
a
smile
at
her
but
you
see
a
detective
ca
afford
to
believe
in
ghosts
we
make
our
living
solving
mysteries
and
to
say
was
the
ghost
you
right
it
was
the
ghost
is
by
way
of
begging
the
question
then
you
think
the
phantoms
that
appeared
to
some
of
us
were
really
human
beings
asked
tracy
interestedly
i
sure
do
and
you
propose
to
find
out
who
and
how
said
braye
if
i
live
up
to
my
reputation
i
must
do
so
there
are
but
two
kinds
of
detectives
effective
detectives
and
defective
detectives
it
is
the
aim
of
my
life
to
belong
to
the
former
class
and
here
my
chance
to
make
good
now
i
examined
the
upper
floors
i
look
over
this
hall
and
the
ground
floor
rooms
shall
i
have
time
before
dinner
mrs
landon
his
charm
and
pleasant
personality
had
already
won
milly
liking
and
she
said
cordially
yes
indeed
mr
wise
and
if
you
wish
we
delay
dinner
to
suit
your
pleasure
not
at
all
done
in
a
few
minutes
stunning
hall
eh
zizi
yes
said
the
thin
little
voice
of
the
thin
little
girl
and
milly
suddenly
realized
that
zizi
was
present
with
the
crowd
the
graceful
little
figure
stepped
forward
and
stood
at
wise
side
as
he
looked
the
hall
over
he
tapped
at
the
panelled
walls
and
smiled
as
he
said
solid
and
intact
no
secret
passage
or
sliding
panel
of
that
sure
if
you
trying
to
find
a
secret
entrance
into
the
house
mr
wise
landon
said
you
are
wasting
your
time
i
am
more
or
less
architecturally
inclined
and
i
tapped
and
sounded
and
measured
and
calculated
and
i
can
assure
you
there
nothing
of
the
sort
good
work
that
saves
me
some
trouble
i
sure
marvellous
work
on
these
doors
eh
and
the
bronze
columns
from
abroad
i
take
it
yes
professor
hardwick
said
slapping
his
hand
against
one
of
the
fluted
bronze
pillars
i
admire
these
columns
more
than
the
doors
even
they
unique
i
do
wonder
their
owner
a
house
behind
them
i
doubt
if
their
match
is
in
america
and
the
locks
and
bolts
are
as
ponderous
as
the
doors
commented
the
detective
eh
zizi
they
are
like
that
all
over
the
house
said
the
girl
in
a
casual
tone
even
the
kitchen
quarters
are
as
securely
fastened
and
bolted
and
upstairs
any
doors
that
give
on
balconies
are
strongly
guarded
i
have
never
seen
a
house
more
carefully
looked
after
in
the
matter
of
barricades
the
girl
spoke
slowly
as
if
on
the
witness
stand
then
suddenly
her
black
eyes
twinkled
and
she
turned
sharply
toward
eve
saying
oh
do
do
that
too
do
what
cried
eve
angrily
what
do
you
mean
scribble
notes
and
pass
to
somebody
i
do
too
it
a
habit
i
ca
seem
to
break
myself
of
i
did
and
eve
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
glittered
with
a
smouldering
fire
oh
tra
la
la
trilled
zizi
and
nonchalantly
turned
away
now
for
the
room
with
the
tassels
said
wise
and
led
the
way
to
the
fateful
room
ghastly
ghostly
and
grisly
he
declared
after
a
quick
survey
but
no
entrance
except
by
door
or
windows
and
they
were
locked
every
time
the
room
was
slept
in
by
any
of
our
party
announced
the
professor
positively
that
makes
it
easier
smiled
wise
you
see
i
feared
secret
panels
and
that
sort
of
thing
not
uncommon
in
old
houses
but
you
found
none
none
asseverated
landon
if
your
theory
of
a
human
is
right
you
got
to
account
for
the
forcing
of
the
big
bolts
of
those
front
doors
or
or
suspect
some
of
your
household
concluded
wise
practically
well
i
have
suspected
any
one
as
yet
i
just
absorbing
facts
on
which
to
base
my
theories
now
for
the
drawing
room
the
long
sombre
room
received
scant
examination
nothing
doing
zizi
said
wise
briefly
only
a
bad
taste
exhibition
the
girl
remarked
making
a
wry
face
at
the
ornate
decorations
and
appointments
then
with
her
peculiar
gliding
motion
she
slid
across
the
hall
again
and
examined
the
knob
and
lock
on
the
door
of
the
room
with
the
tassels
fascinating
room
she
said
with
a
glance
round
it
but
horrible
and
her
thin
shoulders
shrugged
those
tassels
are
enough
to
make
a
hen
cross
the
road
milly
giggled
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
day
of
the
tragedies
dinner
was
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
the
detective
laying
aside
all
thought
or
talk
of
his
purpose
there
was
entertaining
and
even
merry
he
spoke
somewhat
of
himself
and
it
transpired
that
he
was
an
artist
an
illustrator
of
current
magazine
stories
and
zizi
is
my
model
he
informed
them
that
is
when
i
want
a
thin
scarecrow
type
i
do
use
her
for
the
average
peach
heroine
look
out
ziz
do
eat
too
much
of
that
potato
puff
you
see
if
she
puts
on
a
bit
of
flesh
she
runs
straight
back
to
the
movie
studios
ah
a
film
star
said
braye
not
a
star
and
wise
shook
his
head
but
a
good
little
actress
for
a
brat
part
zizi
flashed
an
amused
smile
from
her
black
eyes
and
partook
again
of
the
forbidden
potato
puff
zizi
for
the
love
of
mike
expostulated
wise
the
love
of
mike
is
the
root
of
all
evil
said
zizi
saucily
but
then
everything
is
is
what
asked
eve
interested
against
her
will
in
this
strange
child
is
the
root
of
all
evil
was
the
calm
reply
whew
this
must
be
an
evil
old
world
exclaimed
braye
and
is
it
zizi
flashed
back
her
big
eyes
sparkling
like
liquid
jet
are
you
a
pessimist
little
one
asked
the
professor
studying
the
clever
eerie
face
nay
nay
pauline
and
the
small
pointed
chin
was
raised
a
bit
not
so
but
far
otherwise
then
why
do
you
think
the
world
is
evil
ah
sir
when
one
spends
one
life
between
a
moving
picture
studio
and
a
popular
artist
studio
one
learns
much
that
one
had
better
left
unlearnt
the
child
face
suddenly
looked
ages
old
and
then
as
suddenly
broke
into
a
gay
smile
do
ask
me
these
things
she
said
ask
penny
wise
only
his
pound
foolish
you
put
on
another
foolish
pound
if
you
eat
any
more
of
that
dessert
growled
wise
scowling
at
her
all
right
i
wo
and
the
slender
little
fingers
laid
down
the
teaspoon
zizi
was
using
then
in
an
audible
aside
she
added
hester
will
give
me
more
later
and
chuckled
like
a
naughty
child
the
next
morning
pennington
wise
set
about
his
work
in
earnest
going
to
east
dryden
he
announced
i
want
to
interview
the
doctors
also
stebbins
i
do
mind
saying
frankly
this
is
the
deepest
mystery
i
have
ever
encountered
if
any
of
you
here
can
help
me
i
beg
you
will
do
so
for
the
case
looks
hopeless
ah
there
zizi
the
girl
appeared
ready
to
go
with
wise
in
the
motor
car
she
wore
a
small
black
hat
with
an
oriole
wing
in
it
and
a
black
cape
whose
flutterings
disclosed
an
lining
inconspicuous
save
when
the
cape
lining
showed
zizi
looked
distinguished
and
smartly
costumed
a
small
black
veil
delicately
adjusted
clouded
her
sharp
little
features
and
she
sprang
into
the
car
without
help
and
nestled
into
a
corner
of
the
tonneau
only
a
chauffeur
accompanied
them
and
he
could
not
hear
the
conversation
carried
on
in
low
tones
what
about
it
ziz
murmured
wise
as
they
passed
the
aspen
grove
and
the
black
lake
awful
doings
she
returned
merely
breathing
the
words
the
eve
girl
has
a
secret
too
too
yes
she
is
the
criminal
you
know
i
do
know
well
you
will
know
she
a
queer
mechanism
but
she
never
killed
anybody
sure
zizi
sure
oh
wise
guy
now
who
did
do
it
well
who
did
we
do
know
yet
and
we
must
theorize
without
data
you
know
rats
i
always
theorize
without
data
and
i
never
failed
to
corral
the
data
you
a
deuce
of
a
deducer
you
are
and
you
a
she
sherlock
i
suppose
well
oh
mine
of
wisdom
go
ahead
spill
it
to
me
ca
now
i
lost
my
place
but
after
a
few
more
interviews
with
some
few
more
interested
parties
i
may
perhaps
possibly
maybe
oh
penny
look
back
at
the
house
from
here
did
you
see
such
a
weird
wild
black
aspens
did
indeed
look
repellent
no
one
was
in
sight
and
the
grove
of
black
waving
trees
mirrored
in
the
deep
black
shadows
of
the
lake
gave
it
all
a
doomed
effect
that
the
dull
leaden
sky
intensified
the
grim
old
house
seemed
the
right
abode
for
evil
spirits
or
uneasy
wraiths
and
zizi
fascinated
by
the
still
scene
continued
to
gaze
backward
until
a
turn
of
the
road
hid
it
from
view
then
she
became
silent
and
would
vouchsafe
no
answer
to
wise
questions
or
make
any
remarks
of
her
own
during
the
interview
between
the
detective
and
elijah
stebbins
she
said
almost
nothing
her
big
eyes
staring
at
the
owner
of
black
aspens
until
the
old
man
writhed
in
discomfort
how
did
you
get
in
she
shot
at
him
as
he
frankly
admitted
his
harmless
tricks
to
give
his
tenants
their
desired
interest
in
his
house
i
in
miss
stebbins
said
nervously
twisting
his
fingers
i
staid
there
the
first
night
and
was
then
i
moved
the
old
candlestick
i
do
mean
that
and
zizi
eyes
seemed
to
bore
through
to
his
very
brain
i
mean
the
night
you
played
ghost
why
i
that
is
they
left
a
window
open
they
did
not
zizi
shot
at
him
and
you
know
it
how
did
you
get
in
but
old
stebbins
persisted
in
his
story
of
entrance
by
an
overlooked
window
there
heaps
of
windows
in
that
house
he
declared
land
i
could
get
in
any
time
i
wanted
to
sure
you
could
retorted
zizi
but
not
through
a
window
how
then
said
stebbins
that
what
i
asked
you
i
know
you
know
do
you
know
your
mama
told
my
mama
and
my
mama
told
me
zizi
mocking
laughter
so
incensed
the
old
man
that
he
shook
with
fury
you
do
know
he
cried
there
nothin
to
know
land
all
them
folks
up
there
has
hunted
the
place
for
secret
entrances
and
i
ruther
think
you
have
too
and
he
nodded
at
wise
i
have
said
wise
frankly
and
i
discovered
none
as
yet
but
listen
here
friend
stebbins
if
there
is
one
i
will
find
it
and
that
all
there
is
about
that
zizi
said
nothing
having
returned
to
her
taciturn
rôle
but
the
glance
she
threw
at
stebbins
he
said
afterward
made
his
blood
run
cold
she
a
he
declared
to
his
cronies
when
telling
the
tale
she
ai
all
human
or
a
sinner
on
their
way
to
see
dan
peterson
wise
inquired
concerning
knowledge
of
a
secret
way
to
get
into
the
house
a
small
bluff
she
said
carelessly
i
dunno
how
he
got
in
i
sure
but
i
do
believe
those
people
left
a
window
conveniently
open
unless
they
did
it
on
purpose
who
does
the
locking
up
do
you
know
landon
i
believe
quite
so
it
a
pity
is
it
pen
how
everything
appears
to
wind
around
back
to
that
nice
mr
landon
well
what
now
well
if
he
and
stebbins
were
in
cahoots
hold
up
zizi
do
run
away
with
yourself
you
a
day
ahead
of
the
fair
now
are
you
going
to
talk
in
here
at
peterson
or
sit
like
a
bump
on
a
log
smiling
at
grief
i
dunno
which
would
you
talk
said
wise
succinctly
and
zizi
talked
indeed
she
carried
on
the
main
part
of
the
conversation
which
was
exactly
what
wise
had
meant
for
her
to
do
she
charmed
peterson
with
her
bright
alert
air
and
her
pleasant
way
of
putting
things
together
they
went
over
the
known
details
and
then
she
cleverly
drew
from
peterson
his
deductions
and
decisions
at
first
inclined
to
resent
the
advent
of
this
detective
he
now
began
to
think
that
if
they
could
work
together
he
would
shine
by
reflected
glory
that
is
if
the
new
chap
succeeded
in
solving
the
mystery
which
to
him
was
inexplicable
i
ca
suspect
the
thorpes
or
stebbins
peterson
finally
declared
i
did
think
i
could
but
though
eli
did
cut
up
some
tricks
they
were
harmless
and
merely
in
fun
and
too
he
has
absolute
alibis
for
all
the
spook
appearances
after
a
certain
date
and
that
the
date
when
that
miss
carnforth
saw
a
ghost
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
that
ghost
was
stebbins
himself
but
no
spooks
after
that
was
stebbins
doings
now
i
give
you
that
straight
and
simple
mr
wise
but
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
ferret
it
out
i
suspected
it
but
i
had
hard
work
to
get
stebbins
to
admit
his
tricks
and
also
to
check
up
his
alibis
after
that
particular
night
these
perfectly
attested
alibis
are
sometimes
manufactured
very
carefully
said
zizi
fixing
her
black
eyes
on
peterson
yes
they
are
that
why
i
checked
up
eli
so
carefully
but
all
true
i
got
an
exact
list
of
the
spook
performances
from
the
people
at
the
house
i
got
the
data
from
different
ones
at
different
times
so
to
be
sure
they
were
all
there
then
i
looked
up
whereabouts
on
each
occasion
and
as
i
tell
you
after
the
night
he
owns
up
to
playing
ghost
he
never
did
it
again
then
did
he
arrange
for
the
thorpes
or
one
of
the
to
do
it
queried
zizi
that
i
ca
say
i
think
he
must
have
done
so
but
i
ca
find
a
scrap
of
proof
nor
is
there
any
motive
stebbins
is
a
good
old
sort
and
he
honestly
wanted
to
give
his
tenants
the
as
he
calls
that
they
wanted
but
why
on
this
good
green
earth
he
should
want
to
kill
two
of
them
is
unanswerable
no
take
it
from
me
eli
stebbins
is
no
murderer
i
looked
up
his
record
and
his
life
story
and
there
no
indication
that
he
knew
any
of
these
people
before
they
came
up
here
so
he
could
have
had
any
old
grudge
or
family
feud
or
anything
of
that
sort
stebbins
is
the
criminal
no
i
never
thought
he
was
said
wise
quietly
you
done
good
work
peterson
and
you
saved
me
a
heap
of
trouble
in
getting
these
facts
so
undeniably
established
i
thank
you
and
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
coöperation
in
my
further
work
good
for
you
i
be
right
down
glad
to
work
with
you
and
this
young
lady
mr
wise
is
she
one
of
us
she
us
returned
wise
simply
do
bother
about
her
peterson
she
the
sort
that
looks
after
herself
report
to
me
please
if
you
discover
anything
new
chapter
xv
tracy
story
now
i
would
say
wise
observed
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
occult
phenomena
what
do
you
mean
by
phenomena
interrupted
the
professor
not
one
person
in
ten
uses
that
word
correctly
i
that
single
and
unique
one
old
top
wise
assured
him
for
my
exact
meaning
see
webster
but
i
was
going
to
say
even
granting
the
possibility
of
the
two
deaths
being
due
to
supernatural
causes
i
not
going
to
accept
that
solution
of
the
mystery
until
i
exhausted
all
other
available
means
of
finding
a
flesh
and
blood
murderer
which
same
i
strongly
expect
to
find
he
do
it
said
zizi
addressing
the
others
while
her
black
eyes
looked
at
wise
as
at
an
inanimate
object
he
an
effective
detective
first
last
and
all
the
time
and
i
the
little
cog
that
makes
the
wheels
go
round
so
i
think
that
i
carry
out
a
plan
just
thought
of
i
move
from
the
pretty
little
bedroom
i
now
occupy
and
sleep
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
oh
do
cried
norma
something
might
happen
to
you
that
what
i
flattering
myself
and
it
nice
of
you
miss
cameron
to
speak
out
like
that
zizi
eyes
flashed
a
quizzical
glance
at
eve
who
was
nodding
satisfaction
at
the
proposed
plan
eve
coloured
and
dropped
her
eyes
and
zizi
went
on
you
see
people
mr
wise
ca
size
up
these
ghosts
of
yours
unless
he
sees
them
and
for
me
to
see
them
is
the
same
thing
so
i
going
to
take
the
haunted
room
for
my
own
and
if
the
shawled
woman
appears
i
pin
a
tag
on
her
shawl
norma
shuddered
do
talk
like
that
she
begged
you
do
know
what
risk
you
run
milly
do
let
the
child
sleep
there
but
all
objections
were
overruled
and
zizi
quietly
transferred
her
few
simple
belongings
to
the
room
with
the
tassels
at
breakfast
the
morning
after
her
first
night
in
the
haunted
room
she
declared
she
had
never
slept
better
or
more
soundly
that
there
had
been
no
disturbance
of
any
kind
and
that
she
adored
the
room
you
saw
and
heard
nothing
queried
eve
looking
at
her
intently
nixy
and
the
pert
little
face
was
all
smiles
but
the
game
is
out
till
it
played
out
you
know
i
fail
to
grasp
the
cryptic
meaning
of
that
remark
said
eve
with
an
insolent
stare
at
zizi
same
here
and
the
child
eerie
laugh
rang
out
but
when
i
do
know
exactly
what
to
say
i
sing
out
some
old
saw
like
that
zizi
laugh
was
infectious
and
milly
giggled
in
sympathy
while
the
others
smiled
too
the
experience
was
mine
last
night
said
tracy
in
his
deep
resonant
voice
i
suppose
i
better
tell
of
it
by
all
means
said
penny
wise
as
the
clergyman
hesitated
a
phantom
appeared
to
me
tracy
began
just
as
the
hall
clock
struck
four
i
was
asleep
of
that
i
sure
but
i
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
presence
in
the
room
a
tall
misty
shape
seemed
to
take
form
as
i
looked
and
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
woman
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
she
drew
near
to
me
and
i
could
see
her
face
and
it
was
that
of
a
skull
i
was
stunned
rather
than
frightened
and
when
i
tried
to
call
out
i
could
make
no
sound
the
thing
faded
away
as
gradually
as
it
had
appeared
and
after
a
time
i
regained
a
normal
state
of
nerves
i
want
to
be
an
alarmist
or
frighten
anybody
but
i
well
i
confess
i
did
enjoy
the
experience
and
i
take
occasion
to
say
now
that
i
shall
leave
here
i
going
to
boston
and
will
return
at
any
time
if
for
any
reason
my
presence
is
desired
or
my
affidavit
wanted
as
a
witness
you
all
know
what
i
thought
about
this
whole
matter
while
not
a
spiritualist
i
preserved
an
open
mind
toward
any
revelations
we
may
have
had
and
i
always
ready
to
be
convinced
and
i
may
say
the
sight
i
saw
last
night
has
gone
far
to
convince
me
but
i
do
care
to
see
it
again
tracy
shuddered
and
at
risk
of
being
thought
cowardly
i
determined
to
go
away
i
had
intended
to
go
shortly
anyway
and
i
prefer
to
go
i
do
blame
you
old
chap
said
braye
heartily
there
no
reason
why
you
should
jeopardize
your
nervous
system
by
exposing
it
to
further
shocks
let
mr
wise
take
down
the
details
of
your
story
keep
in
touch
with
us
as
to
your
whereabouts
and
where
we
can
communicate
with
you
and
go
ahead
i
do
blame
you
one
bit
in
fact
if
any
one
else
wants
to
leave
no
objections
will
be
made
how
about
you
professor
i
want
to
stay
please
i
terribly
interested
in
the
matter
and
i
think
mr
wise
is
making
progress
and
will
make
more
rapidly
anxious
to
stay
i
game
too
said
landon
in
fact
i
think
we
all
want
to
see
it
through
except
tracy
and
he
is
not
so
closely
associated
with
the
case
as
the
rest
of
us
so
tracy
went
about
noon
of
that
day
and
left
an
address
that
he
said
would
always
reach
him
wherever
he
might
be
temporarily
milly
and
norma
regretted
his
going
for
they
had
come
to
like
the
grave
kindly
man
but
eve
seemed
not
to
care
and
the
men
were
all
so
interested
in
the
work
of
penny
wise
that
they
only
gave
a
hearty
and
godspeed
to
the
departing
cleric
queer
that
spook
should
appear
to
him
said
wise
after
tracy
had
gone
he
told
me
some
time
ago
said
norma
reminiscently
that
he
often
heard
strange
sounds
at
four
in
the
morning
he
said
they
were
like
faint
moans
and
rustlings
and
sometimes
a
soft
step
along
the
halls
did
he
ever
see
anything
before
asked
zizi
i
do
think
so
he
was
not
very
communicative
about
it
anyway
i
think
he
was
nervous
on
the
subject
i
know
he
was
eve
spoke
scornfully
he
was
afraid
i
positive
no
one
ought
to
have
joined
this
party
who
was
afraid
we
only
asked
him
to
fill
in
you
know
said
milly
rather
apologizing
for
the
minister
timidity
and
goodness
knows
afraid
or
i
should
be
if
wynne
were
always
with
me
if
that
thing
appeared
to
me
well
milly
could
find
no
words
to
express
her
horror
and
landon
looked
at
her
anxiously
it
wo
said
zizi
reassuringly
it
wo
mrs
landon
how
do
you
know
said
eve
a
bit
abruptly
your
mama
told
my
mama
and
my
mama
told
me
returned
zizi
who
could
put
such
graphic
impudence
into
the
silly
phrase
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
amused
at
it
oh
do
do
that
too
she
added
as
eve
bit
her
lip
in
annoyance
so
do
i
it
such
a
hard
habit
to
break
ai
it
but
you
ought
to
it
scars
your
lips
now
penny
wise
if
you
go
for
a
walk
and
a
talk
with
your
little
otherwise
she
tell
you
sumpum
that
you
ought
to
know
look
out
ziz
wise
said
to
her
as
they
walked
off
by
themselves
and
followed
the
path
by
the
lake
you
must
be
too
saucy
to
miss
carnforth
or
there
be
trouble
have
to
honey
i
got
to
get
her
real
mad
at
me
to
find
out
her
secret
she
no
criminal
as
i
told
you
but
she
knows
who
is
do
you
not
yet
but
soon
now
listen
while
i
expound
a
few
friend
spook
did
appear
to
me
last
night
really
sure
as
shootin
i
thought
it
over
and
decided
i
better
not
admit
it
to
the
gaping
crowd
or
we
never
find
out
who
does
the
stunt
but
really
zizi
yes
really
pen
it
was
about
two
not
four
a
tall
shape
draped
in
white
breezed
in
and
toddled
around
trying
to
attract
my
attention
i
lay
there
and
looked
sort
of
as
if
i
was
awake
but
kinda
hypnotized
you
know
well
i
kept
up
that
attitude
and
the
thing
came
nearer
and
leaned
over
me
and
sure
enough
it
had
a
skull
for
a
face
but
land
penny
it
was
a
skull
a
mask
you
know
be
fine
in
the
movies
i
must
put
manager
reeves
up
to
that
dodge
go
on
ziz
well
the
thing
the
person
i
mean
for
it
was
a
real
live
person
all
right
sashayed
around
a
bit
then
gave
a
hollow
groan
i
guess
what
they
call
hollow
and
slid
out
that
all
you
a
corker
zizi
why
did
you
yell
i
wanted
to
see
the
game
then
when
the
visitor
left
i
knew
it
was
because
i
was
supposed
to
have
been
sufficiently
impressed
i
thought
it
over
and
i
decided
that
at
breakfast
i
say
i
had
seen
anything
and
see
who
looked
and
by
jiminy
nobody
did
if
any
one
around
that
table
was
my
visiting
spook
he
or
she
carried
it
off
something
marvellous
not
one
of
flickered
an
eyelash
when
i
said
i
had
a
sweet
sound
sleep
all
night
i
ca
see
how
any
one
could
be
so
now
penny
could
it
have
been
anybody
who
was
at
the
breakfast
table
meaning
stebbins
or
the
thorpes
oh
no
none
of
them
but
how
about
some
outsider
hired
you
know
by
somebody
in
the
house
how
he
get
in
there
a
secret
way
into
this
house
you
need
tell
me
there
is
just
you
have
stumbled
over
it
yet
also
who
doing
the
hiring
you
said
everything
came
around
toward
landon
there
motive
there
you
see
after
braye
landon
inherits
all
the
bruce
fortune
and
that
millions
what
the
matter
with
braye
being
the
murderer
he
inherits
first
that
just
it
if
braye
wanted
to
kill
his
relatives
to
get
the
fortune
he
would
do
it
up
here
where
he
so
liable
to
be
suspected
he
invent
some
subtler
way
or
some
less
suspicious
scheme
but
landon
could
do
it
up
here
and
feel
sure
the
suspicion
would
fall
on
braye
then
you
see
braye
gets
the
money
and
later
on
landon
puts
him
out
too
in
some
awfully
clever
way
that
ca
be
traced
to
him
see
and
too
braye
has
declared
he
give
all
the
money
if
necessary
to
discovering
the
criminal
if
there
is
one
and
he
said
he
give
what
was
left
to
build
a
hospital
no
he
does
want
the
money
that
came
to
him
in
such
an
awful
way
leastwise
not
if
it
throws
suspicion
on
him
he
going
to
be
cleared
or
he
not
going
to
use
the
money
for
himself
miss
carnforth
told
me
all
that
i
talked
a
lot
with
her
you
talked
with
all
of
them
have
you
yes
indeed
i
babbled
on
and
most
often
they
tell
me
a
lot
that
they
do
realize
landon
now
she
struggling
hard
not
to
suspect
her
own
husband
but
miss
carnforth
has
said
a
few
things
that
scare
landon
to
death
oh
penny
it
a
fearful
case
we
must
fix
it
up
we
must
we
will
zizi
there
so
much
evidence
not
to
be
denied
that
we
must
ferret
out
what
it
really
means
i
getting
a
glimmer
but
your
help
is
invaluable
that
was
a
stroke
of
genius
for
you
not
to
tell
of
your
ghost
were
you
frightened
not
a
bit
all
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
find
out
who
it
was
but
i
dare
grab
at
it
for
i
knew
it
would
get
away
i
hope
it
will
come
again
i
try
to
make
it
speak
and
maybe
i
get
a
line
on
the
voice
was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
i
could
tell
the
draperies
were
long
and
full
and
the
covered
the
face
did
you
see
the
hand
it
was
lost
in
the
draped
shawl
but
i
sure
i
have
another
visit
and
then
i
get
more
information
you
think
i
did
well
oh
wise
guy
i
do
indeed
and
the
approving
smile
that
was
zizi
most
welcome
reward
lighted
up
the
detective
face
zizi
pursued
her
plan
of
talking
to
the
various
people
separately
she
gleaned
much
this
way
and
with
her
powers
of
lightning
calculation
she
put
two
and
two
together
with
astounding
results
she
even
lured
the
old
professor
into
a
conversation
no
i
do
believe
those
deaths
were
supernatural
he
said
thoughtfully
i
did
but
it
too
incredible
however
it
no
more
unbelievable
than
that
they
could
have
been
accomplished
by
human
power
they
were
and
zizi
black
head
nodded
affirmation
how
then
by
a
diabolically
clever
genius
tell
me

sip
not
more
i
sure

was
poison
in

tea

been
but

tea
and
poured
the
cups
and
vernie
and
tracy
yes

landon
were
passing
the
things
around
it
was
all
most
informal

never
have
the
servants
in
at
i
really
say
just
who
did
give
bruce
his
cup
vernie
gave
me
mine
i
think
well
the
poison
was
put
in
bruce
cup
after
miss
carnforth
fixed
it
for
him

my
soul

you
think
so
that
lets
braye
out
then
for
he
there
you
do
suspect
braye
do
you
no
of
course
not
but
i
do
really
suspect
anybody
but
braye
is
the
heir
you
know
and
so
may
be
said
to
have
motive
that
is
true
of
landon
in
a
way
i
ca
suspect
either
of
those
two
it
impossible
go
on
professor
tell
me
about
the
little
girl
death
you
heard
it
before
i
know
but
every
little
helps
she
was
across
the
room
i
was
looking
at
bruce
of
course
when
i
heard
an
exclamation
from
whom
i
do
know
miss
carnforth
i
think
any
way
she
and
tracy
were
bending
over
vernie
they
had
laid
her
on
a
couch
and
in
a
moment
they
said
she
was
dead
at
the
same
time
bruce
breathed
his
last
it
was
all
so
fearful
so
terrible
we
were
stunned
at
least
i
was
and
one
by
one
we
pulled
ourselves
together
trying
to
realize
what
had
happened
all
right
i
know
the
rest
you
helped
me
a
little
do
you
suspect
anybody
does
mr
wise
tell
me
child
i
can
doubtless
be
of
help
if
i
know
what
to
do
no
professor
you
ca
help
it
very
awful
but
it
will
soon
be
clear
to
all
heaven
help
that
poor
miss
carnforth
nonsense
eve
did
do
it
of
that
i
certain
so
am
i
of
course
miss
carnforth
did
do
it
the
tea
was
all
right
when
she
fixed
bruce
cup
then
who
tampered
with
it
not
vernie
but
zizi
had
run
away
she
had
a
way
of
making
sudden
exits
and
entrances
and
one
never
knew
where
she
was
or
when
she
would
appear
that
night
zizi
declared
that
she
hoped
the
ghost
would
visit
her
she
said
this
openly
as
the
whole
crowd
were
preparing
to
go
to
their
rooms
for
the
night
perhaps
it
will
said
wise
looking
at
her
thoughtfully
if
it
called
on
tracy
last
night
it
may
be
here
again
and
you
may
be
favoured
are
you
not
afraid
not
of
the
ghost
said
zizi
but
i
am
afraid
that
some
of
you
people
may
play
a
trick
just
to
scare
me
will
you
double
up
so
i
can
feel
sure
there
nothing
of
that
sort
i
take
tracy
room
said
mr
wise
then
i
can
keep
my
eye
on
braye
and
professor
hardwick
though
i
no
mental
image
of
either
of
them
trailing
round
in
sheets
i
should
say
not
and
braye
shuddered
no
miss
zizi
you
nothing
to
fear
from
us
nor
us
norma
assured
her
i
was
going
to
sleep
in
the
room
with
miss
carnforth
anyway
and
that
will
preclude
either
of
us
impersonating
a
phantom
what
an
awful
idea
and
eve
glowered
at
zizi
you
do
really
think
any
of
us
would
stoop
to
such
a
despicable
thing
do
you
you
never
can
tell
said
zizi
nonchalantly
landon
you
let
your
husband
leave
your
room
will
you
no
said
milly
not
at
all
resenting
the
question
which
zizi
put
to
her
in
a
gentle
pleading
tone
very
different
from
that
she
had
used
to
the
others
and
so
the
inmates
of
the
house
being
accounted
for
and
the
doors
and
windows
looked
after
with
extra
care
and
precaution
the
household
settled
itself
to
quietness
and
the
dark
hours
passed
ticked
off
and
struck
by
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
it
was
between
two
and
three
when
zizi
watching
perceived
her
door
slowly
and
silently
swing
open
determined
to
learn
all
possible
as
to
who
the
intruder
could
be
the
girl
lay
motionless
but
breathing
deeply
as
if
asleep
her
eyes
almost
closed
yet
took
in
every
movement
of
her
silent
visitor
it
was
no
ghost
but
a
tall
figure
clad
in
a
long
black
cloak
and
wearing
a
black
mask
with
a
swift
stride
that
betokened
a
man
the
figure
approached
the
bed
having
first
softly
closed
the
door
that
led
to
the
hall
watching
covertly
for
the
next
development
zizi
was
all
unprepared
for
what
really
happened
the
man
with
a
sudden
swift
gesture
took
the
girl
chin
in
one
strong
hand
and
opened
her
mouth
while
with
the
other
he
thrust
in
a
thick
soft
cloth
saturated
with
chloroform
not
enough
to
make
her
lose
her
senses
entirely
it
partially
stupefied
her
and
the
choking
cloth
prevented
all
speech
whipping
off
the
long
dark
cloak
he
wore
the
man
flung
it
round
zizi
as
he
lifted
the
slender
form
from
the
bed
vainly
trying
to
emit
a
shriek
or
utter
a
groan
zizi
fell
back
in
the
arms
that
supported
her
after
an
unknown
interval
a
draught
of
cool
air
on
her
face
brought
her
back
to
a
dim
consciousness
and
she
realized
she
was
out
of
doors
a
struggle
of
her
arms
and
legs
resulted
in
a
firmer
grasp
of
the
strong
arms
that
carried
her
and
she
quit
moving
to
think
she
had
been
kidnapped
taken
from
her
bed
and
had
been
carried
out
of
doors
but
she
had
no
knowledge
of
who
her
captor
was
nor
by
what
means
they
had
left
the
house
her
brain
was
furiously
wide
awake
but
she
made
no
move
lest
more
chloroform
be
administered
and
she
lose
her
regained
consciousness
on
the
shore
of
the
black
lake
the
man
stopped
and
set
her
on
her
feet
her
mouth
still
filled
with
the
soft
cloth
was
strained
and
painful
but
the
first
attempt
to
raise
her
hand
resulted
in
its
being
clutched
by
the
strong
hand
of
the
man
who
swayed
her
destiny
so
slender
and
light
was
she
that
he
handled
her
as
one
might
a
child
and
in
his
strong
grasp
she
was
as
powerless
as
an
infant
working
quickly
and
deftly
he
tied
a
strong
rope
round
her
ankles
and
to
it
attached
what
was
only
too
evidently
a
bag
of
stones
or
bricks
then
without
a
word
he
flung
her
into
the
deep
dark
waters
of
the
lake
and
with
one
backward
glance
he
walked
away
chapter
xvi
what
happened
to
zizi
just
like
a
kitten
zizi
sputtered
just
like
a
little
kitten
ugh
i
as
mad
as
a
wet
hen
she
was
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
dripping
wet
daubed
with
mud
her
black
eyes
snapping
with
anger
when
she
had
been
thrown
into
the
pool
the
big
entangling
cape
had
caught
in
the
sedge
grass
that
bordered
the
water
and
clutching
this
the
girl
had
hung
on
till
she
could
manage
to
slip
her
slim
little
feet
from
the
rope
that
bound
them
a
stiff
rope
and
clumsily
tied
it
had
been
possible
to
free
herself
though
she
might
not
have
been
able
to
do
it
but
for
her
experiences
as
a
moving
picture
actress
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
been
flung
into
water
for
her
slim
agility
had
proved
useful
in
film
thrillers
and
acrobatic
feats
were
her
long
suit
able
too
to
remain
under
water
for
a
few
moments
without
breathing
she
had
freed
herself
from
the
rope
and
scrambled
up
the
bank
almost
as
rapidly
as
she
had
been
sent
to
her
intended
doom
she
had
pulled
the
cloth
from
her
mouth
and
sat
breathing
in
good
air
but
too
exhausted
to
rise
if
he
only
spoken
drat
him
she
muttered
and
yet
it
have
been
that
wretch
i
it
was
but
how
can
i
prove
it
oh
i
wish
it
was
so
dark
and
i
so
she
got
up
now
and
tried
to
wring
the
water
from
the
cloak
that
she
still
clutched
round
her
beside
that
she
had
on
her
nightdress
and
a
thin
silk
kimono
both
of
which
were
wetly
clinging
to
her
slim
little
body
throwing
the
still
soaking
wet
cloak
about
her
and
shivering
as
it
sopped
against
her
she
went
toward
the
house
it
stood
still
and
sombre
a
black
thing
amid
blacker
shadows
the
aspen
branches
soughed
eerily
but
no
other
sound
broke
the
silence
the
great
doors
were
closed
the
windows
all
shut
and
no
sign
of
life
was
visible
zizi
hesitated
should
she
whistle
beneath
penny
wise
window
or
the
alternative
she
thought
of
seemed
to
her
best
and
she
drew
her
wet
draperies
about
her
and
scuttled
off
at
a
smart
pace
toward
the
village
barefooted
as
she
was
she
chose
grassy
ground
whenever
possible
but
her
feet
were
sadly
cut
and
bruised
before
she
reached
her
destination
this
was
the
house
of
dan
peterson
and
a
ring
at
his
doorbell
brought
the
sound
of
a
hastily
window
and
a
sharp
who
there
me
said
zizi
truthfully
please
let
me
in
not
quite
certain
of
the
identity
of
his
caller
but
touched
by
the
pleading
little
voice
peterson
came
downstairs
followed
by
his
wife
a
few
words
of
explanation
resulted
in
zizi
being
put
into
warm
dry
clothes
and
tucked
into
bed
by
peterson
who
admonished
her
to
like
a
baby
till
mornin
which
nothing
loth
zizi
did
morning
at
black
aspens
brought
a
shock
of
surprise
it
was
hester
who
first
discovered
the
absence
of
zizi
from
the
room
with
the
tassels
hester
had
been
fond
of
the
child
from
the
beginning
and
in
spite
of
her
fifteen
years
and
her
even
older
zizi
was
a
child
in
many
ways
hester
mothered
her
whenever
possible
though
zizi
natural
efficiency
made
little
assistance
really
necessary
but
hester
loved
to
wait
on
her
and
so
this
morning
when
going
into
the
room
with
a
can
of
hot
water
she
found
no
sleepy
little
occupant
of
the
great
bed
she
ran
straight
upstairs
to
miss
carnforth
room
where
that
child
she
demanded
as
eve
opened
the
door
to
her
loud
knock
what
child
who
zizi
she
gone
sperrited
away
what
have
you
done
with
her
hush
hester
you
act
crazy
and
crazy
i
am
if
any
harm
come
to
that
girl
where
is
she
doors
opened
and
heads
were
thrust
out
as
the
voice
of
the
irate
hester
was
heard
about
the
house
penny
wise
in
bathrobe
and
slippers
appeared
saying
what
up
zizi
disappeared
yes
moaned
hester
her
bed
been
slept
in
but
she
ai
nowhere
to
be
found
oh
where
can
she
be
be
quiet
commanded
wise
he
ran
downstairs
and
examined
the
doors
and
windows
minutely
except
for
those
that
hester
or
thorpe
had
opened
that
morning
all
were
locked
as
they
had
been
left
the
night
before
she
may
be
in
the
house
somewhere
suggested
norma
and
tearful
not
she
said
wise
she
would
hear
our
commotion
and
come
to
us
zizi
is
not
one
to
play
mischievous
tricks
but
how
did
she
get
out
how
did
vernie
body
get
out
asked
braye
gravely
there
no
chance
for
a
human
marauder
this
time
no
and
professor
hardwick
looked
over
the
great
locks
and
bolts
on
the
front
doors
and
examined
the
window
catches
pennington
wise
looked
very
serious
do
talk
any
foolishness
about
spooks
he
said
sternly
i
want
to
hear
it
zizi
has
been
carried
off
by
mortal
hands
and
if
any
harm
has
been
done
her
it
will
go
hard
with
the
villain
who
is
responsible
who
could
have
done
it
and
why
cried
eve
those
who
know
the
most
about
it
are
often
the
loudest
in
their
lamentations
wise
returned
and
stalked
off
to
his
room
breakfast
was
eaten
in
a
silence
that
seemed
portentous
of
impending
trouble
pennington
wise
was
deep
in
thought
and
apparently
had
no
knowledge
of
what
he
was
eating
nor
any
consciousness
of
the
people
about
him
during
the
meal
a
note
was
brought
to
him
by
a
messenger
from
the
village
he
read
it
and
slipped
it
in
his
pocket
without
a
word
after
breakfast
he
requested
the
entire
household
including
the
servants
to
gather
in
the
hall
he
addressed
them
in
grave
earnest
tones
without
anger
or
undue
excitement
saying
in
part
i
have
made
considerable
progress
in
the
investigations
of
the
tragedies
that
have
occurred
in
this
house
i
have
learned
much
regarding
the
crimes
and
i
think
i
have
discovered
who
the
guilty
party
is
i
may
say
in
passing
that
there
is
not
and
has
not
been
any
supernatural
influence
at
work
any
one
who
says
that
there
has
is
either
blindly
ignorant
of
or
criminally
implicated
in
the
whole
matter
the
two
deaths
were
vile
and
wicked
murders
and
they
are
going
to
be
avenged
the
kidnapping
of
zizi
is
the
work
of
the
same
diabolical
ingenuity
that
compassed
the
deaths
of
two
innocent
victims
a
third
death
that
of
my
clever
child
assistant
was
necessary
to
prevent
discovery
hence
fate
is
she
dead
wailed
hester
oh
mr
wise
is
she
dead
i
will
tell
you
what
happened
to
her
said
wise
quietly
she
was
taken
from
her
bed
in
the
haunted
room
she
was
carried
out
of
the
house
and
a
bundle
of
bricks
was
tied
to
her
and
she
was
thrown
into
the
lake
that
what
happened
to
zizi
milly
screamed
hysterically
norma
cameron
cried
softly
and
eve
carnforth
exclaimed
with
blazing
eyes
i
do
believe
it
you
are
making
that
up
how
can
you
know
it
why
did
you
rescue
her
the
men
uttered
various
exclamations
of
incredulity
and
horror
and
the
servants
sat
aghast
pennington
wise
surveyed
rapidly
one
face
after
another
noting
the
expression
of
each
and
sighing
as
if
disappointed
she
is
not
dead
he
said
suddenly
and
watched
again
the
telltale
countenances
what
cried
wynne
landon
bricks
tied
to
her
and
thrown
in
the
lake
but
not
drowned
who
saved
her
life
she
herself
returned
wise
did
you
zizi
and
there
she
was
in
the
back
of
the
hall
behind
the
group
every
member
of
which
turned
to
see
her
peterson
was
with
her
and
the
two
came
forward
zizi
was
garbed
in
clothes
that
peterson
had
lent
her
and
though
too
large
she
had
pinned
up
the
plain
black
dress
until
it
looked
neither
grotesque
nor
unbecoming
yes
i
here
she
announced
but
only
because
a
bag
o
bones
ca
be
sunk
by
a
bag
o
bricks
your
shawled
woman
only
he
did
have
his
shawl
over
his
head
carried
me
off
about
as
easy
as
he
might
have
sneaked
off
a
then
shall
i
tell
all
pen
yes
child
tell
it
all
just
as
it
happened
well
he
stuffed
a
bale
of
cotton
into
my
mouth
which
same
was
soaked
with
chloroform
so
naturally
i
could
yell
likewise
i
did
know
just
where
i
was
at
for
a
few
minutes
who
was
he
exclaimed
braye
what
did
he
look
like
was
it
the
skull
face
asked
eve
nixy
on
the
bone
face
returned
zizi
he
was
a
plain
clothes
man
in
civilian
dress
with
a
black
mask
over
his
patrician
features
do
you
know
who
it
was
and
eve
voice
was
intense
and
strained
not
positively
zizi
answered
well
he
picked
me
up
like
i
was
a
feather
and
how
he
got
out
of
the
house
i
no
idea
but
i
felt
a
breeze
of
night
air
and
there
was
i
by
the
bank
of
the
lake
and
there
was
he
busily
engaged
in
tying
a
load
of
bricks
to
my
ankles
did
you
scream
asked
the
professor
absorbed
in
the
account
my
dear
man
how
could
i
with
my
mouth
with
a
large
and
elegant
bundle
of
gag
i
was
thankful
that
my
wits
were
workin
let
alone
my
lung
power
well
he
tossed
me
in
the
nasty
black
lake
and
that
where
he
spilled
the
beans
for
ground
and
lofty
tumbling
into
lakes
is
my
specialty
i
the
humble
disciple
of
miss
annette
kellerman
and
not
so
awful
humble
either
so
i
held
my
breath
under
water
long
enough
to
wriggle
my
feet
out
of
those
ropes
the
old
stupid
did
know
how
to
tie
anything
but
a
granny
slip
knot
and
i
scrambled
out
just
as
my
windpipe
was
beginning
to
go
back
on
me
you
make
light
of
it
zizi
but
it
was
a
narrow
squeak
said
wise
looking
at
her
gravely
you
bet
it
was
if
he
had
a
softer
rope
i
been
done
for
it
was
the
stiffness
of
that
rope
and
well
the
stiffness
of
my
upper
lip
that
rescued
your
little
ziz
from
a
watery
grave
and
horrid
dirty
old
water
too
wise
slipped
his
arm
round
the
child
and
told
her
to
go
on
with
the
story
then
she
proceeded
i
squz
out
what
wetness
i
could
from
my
few
scanty
robes
in
which
i
was
bedecked
and
i
borrowed
the
long
cloak
which
friend
kidnapper
had
kindly
wrapped
me
in
what
kind
of
a
cloak
asked
eve
nothing
very
smart
said
zizi
nonchalantly
looked
to
me
like
an
waterproof
the
kind
they
wore
before
raincoats
came
in
only
it
waterproof
not
by
several
jugs
full
but
i
wrung
it
out
all
i
could
and
then
i
tried
to
get
in
the
house
but
it
was
all
locked
up
and
as
it
seemed
a
pity
to
disturb
all
you
sound
sleepers
i
ran
to
the
village
and
begged
a
lodging
with
my
friend
peterson
he
and
his
wife
were
most
kind
and
put
me
in
a
nice
dry
little
bed
that
had
no
tassels
or
ghosts
attached
to
it
i
sent
mr
wise
a
note
as
soon
as
i
could
so
he
would
worry
that
was
the
note
i
received
at
the
breakfast
table
wise
informed
them
now
you
see
there
is
a
real
man
at
the
bottom
of
the
villainy
going
on
up
here
he
desired
to
remove
zizi
lest
she
discover
his
crime
and
i
daresay
he
planned
to
dispose
of
me
also
if
he
could
manage
it
his
seems
to
be
a
will
that
stops
at
nothing
that
is
ready
to
commit
any
crime
or
any
number
of
crimes
to
save
his
own
skin
has
anybody
present
any
idea
of
the
identity
of
this
man
any
reason
to
suspect
any
one
any
light
whatever
to
throw
on
the
situation
no
declared
landon
we
have
not
i
speak
for
myself
and
for
all
present
when
i
say
we
have
no
knowledge
of
a
wretch
answering
to
that
description
nor
did
i
suppose
that
such
existed
can
you
track
him
down
mr
wise
is
your
power
sufficient
to
discover
and
deal
death
to
this
beast
you
describe
i
hope
so
and
penny
wise
carefully
scrutinized
the
face
of
the
speaker
i
think
landon
that
with
zizi
help
with
the
enlightenment
her
awful
experience
gives
us
i
can
get
the
criminal
and
that
in
a
short
time
good
exclaimed
hardwick
i
am
not
vindictive
but
i
confess
i
never
wanted
anything
more
than
to
see
brought
to
justice
the
man
who
could
conceive
and
carry
out
such
diabolical
crimes
are
you
sure
they
are
one
and
the
same
asked
braye
i
mean
the
man
who
killed
bruce
and
vernie
and
the
one
who
carried
off
miss
zizi
yes
said
wise
thoughtfully
there
are
not
two
such
i
should
say
but
the
quest
of
one
person
is
my
immediate
business
if
i
find
there
are
others
implicated
i
shall
get
them
too
i
am
not
more
incensed
over
the
attack
on
zizi
than
on
your
two
friends
but
i
do
deny
it
has
given
me
an
added
wrong
to
avenge
but
for
the
child
strong
nerve
and
clever
quickness
of
action
she
would
now
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
where
he
stopped
abruptly
go
away
all
of
you
he
said
in
a
low
strained
voice
i
mean
go
about
your
business
but
leave
me
to
myself
for
a
time
peterson
come
in
here
he
went
into
the
room
with
the
tassels
peterson
followed
and
zizi
glided
in
beside
them
the
door
closed
and
the
group
left
in
the
hall
looked
at
one
another
in
perplexity
and
horror
i
ca
understand
wynne
said
milly
who
took
zizi
away
i
do
know
dear
what
do
you
think
professor
i
think
in
so
many
directions
that
i
sure
none
of
them
is
right
awful
things
suggest
themselves
to
my
mind
but
i
ca
believe
them
and
i
dismiss
them
half
thought
out
that
the
way
with
me
sighed
braye
it
looks
now
as
if
there
must
be
some
one
who
gets
in
from
outside
the
house
and
who
is
responsible
for
all
the
inexplicable
happenings
of
course
that
would
point
to
stebbins
we
must
all
admit
that
the
servants
had
left
the
hall
so
braye
permitted
himself
this
freedom
of
speech
i
do
say
it
stebbins
the
professor
mused
but
i
do
think
some
one
from
outside
there
may
be
a
village
inhabitant
who
is
possessed
of
a
homicidal
mania
that
the
theory
that
seems
to
me
the
only
one
possible
and
we
must
assume
now
that
there
is
a
secret
way
to
get
in
and
out
of
the
house
if
so
that
clever
detective
ought
to
find
it
argued
braye
perhaps
he
will
said
hardwick
also
perhaps
he
has
he
does
tell
all
he
knows
now
this
is
certain
all
here
present
are
i
am
thankful
to
say
free
from
any
breath
of
suspicion
for
last
night
you
braye
and
the
detective
and
i
all
slept
with
our
doors
open
and
none
of
us
could
have
left
our
rooms
without
being
observed
by
the
others
the
same
is
true
of
the
ladies
and
of
course
landon
can
vouch
for
her
husband
do
talk
that
way
said
norma
with
a
shudder
you
know
none
of
us
could
be
suspected
not
by
ourselves
agreed
the
professor
nor
by
each
other
of
course
but
by
an
outsider
or
by
the
servants
or
by
the
detectives
it
is
indeed
a
good
thing
to
have
matters
arranged
as
they
are
i
feel
a
decided
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
no
unjust
suspicion
can
attach
itself
to
any
one
of
our
party
that
so
and
braye
nodded
but
it
does
get
us
any
nearer
to
the
real
criminal
i
incline
to
the
professor
idea
of
a
man
of
homicidal
mania
in
the
village
they
say
that
a
real
disease
and
that
such
people
are
diabolically
clever
and
cunning
in
carrying
out
their
criminal
impulses
but
how
could
such
a
man
get
in
asked
eve
her
eyes
wide
with
wonder
we
do
know
said
braye
but
there
must
be
a
secret
entrance
why
stebbins
as
good
as
admitted
there
was
but
he
would
tell
where
it
was
however
it
unimportant
how
he
got
in
if
he
did
get
in
do
you
mean
that
some
such
person
acted
the
ghost
and
all
that
said
norma
dubiously
but
if
so
how
could
he
kill
bruce
and
vernie
oh
it
too
ridiculous
those
two
deaths
were
not
occasioned
by
any
crazy
man
from
east
dryden
it
impossible
come
out
for
a
little
stroll
norma
said
braye
to
her
seeing
how
nervously
excited
the
girl
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
will
do
you
good
and
we
can
do
nothing
here
they
went
out
into
the
pleasant
august
sunshine
and
strolled
toward
the
lake
not
that
way
begged
norma
it
too
horrible
oh
rudolph
who
do
you
suppose
tried
to
drown
that
poor
little
zizi
nobody
norma
she
made
up
that
yarn
oh
no
rudolph
i
do
think
so
yes
she
did
that
wise
is
trying
to
get
at
his
discoveries
in
the
theatrical
fashion
all
detectives
love
to
use
and
that
movie
actress
is
part
of
his
stock
in
trade
she
fell
in
the
lake
all
right
i
daresay
but
the
tale
about
the
bogey
man
is
fictitious
be
sure
of
that
but
how
did
she
get
out
of
the
house
and
leave
all
the
doors
locked
behind
her
perhaps
as
the
professor
suggested
wise
knows
of
the
secret
entrance
if
there
is
one
and
of
course
zizi
does
too
or
that
little
monkey
could
have
scrambled
down
from
the
window
she
as
agile
as
a
cat
anyway
norma
she
was
pitched
in
the
lake
by
the
same
villain
that
did
for
uncle
gif
and
vernie
who
could
that
have
been
who
indeed
rudolph
tell
me
one
thing
please
be
frank
do
you
think
any
one
we
know
is
is
responsible
for
those
deaths
braye
turned
a
pained
look
at
her
do
ask
such
questions
dear
he
said
i
ca
answer
you
i
do
want
to
answer
i
am
answered
said
norma
sadly
i
know
you
share
the
the
fear
i
wo
call
it
a
suspicion
that
eve
and
i
do
and
rudolph
milly
fears
it
too
she
wo
say
so
of
course
but
i
know
by
the
way
she
looks
at
wynne
when
she
thinks
no
one
notices
and
she
so
afraid
mr
wise
will
look
in
that
direction
oh
rudolph
must
we
let
that
detective
go
on
no
matter
what
he
exposes
landon
got
him
up
here
said
braye
no
the
professor
really
heard
of
him
first
but
landon
urged
his
coming
milly
did
could
wynne
have
been
prompted
by
by
bravado
i
do
know
dear
please
do
talk
of
it
norma
it
seems
i
know
it
seems
disloyal
to
wynne
for
us
even
to
hint
at
such
a
thing
but
if
we
could
help
him
how
oh
i
do
know
i
suppose
we
ought
to
condone
and
too
rudolph
if
this
should
remain
undiscovered
should
be
all
hushed
up
you
know
and
if
nobody
should
really
accuse
you
know
who
would
life
be
in
danger
hush
norma
i
wo
listen
to
such
talk
has
eve
put
you
up
to
all
this
she
and
i
have
talked
it
over
yes
she
is
so
anxious
for
you
for
me
yes
you
know
eve
cares
a
great
deal
for
you
hush
dear
you
not
yourself
and
i
do
wonder
the
awful
times
we
going
through
are
enough
to
upset
your
nerves
but
never
speak
of
eve
carnforth
and
me
in
that
tone
you
know
norma
i
love
you
and
you
only
i
want
you
for
my
own
my
darling
and
when
we
get
away
from
these
awful
scenes
i
shall
woo
and
win
you
chapter
xvii
stebbins
owns
up
now
stebbins
you
better
speak
out
in
meetin
and
tell
all
you
know
tell
your
auntie
zizi
jes
how
naughty
you
was
and
how
you
managed
it
now
it
all
out
zizi
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
in
elijah
stebbins
office
and
leaned
toward
him
her
eerie
little
face
enticingly
near
his
and
her
smile
such
as
would
charm
the
birds
off
the
trees
stebbins
looked
at
her
and
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair
i
did
do
nothin
wrong
he
began
i
played
a
silly
trick
or
two
but
it
was
only
in
fun
when
i
see
they
took
it
seriously
i
quit
yes
i
know
all
that
and
the
impatient
visitor
shook
a
prompting
little
forefinger
at
him
i
know
everything
you
said
and
did
to
scare
those
people
into
fits
and
when
they
would
scare
but
just
lapped
up
your
spook
rackets
you
quit
as
you
say
and
then
they
took
up
the
business
themselves
you
sure
of
that
i
am
certain
also
i
know
who
did
it
what
i
after
is
to
find
out
a
few
missing
ways
and
means
now
you
a
tricksy
puck
were
you
when
you
moved
the
old
battered
candlestick
that
first
night
and
it
did
no
harm
that
i
admit
it
roused
their
curiosity
and
started
the
spook
ball
rolling
then
as
a
ghost
you
appeared
to
bruce
did
you
well
i
did
stebbins
grudgingly
confessed
forced
by
the
compelling
black
eyes
i
just
wrop
a
shawl
over
my
head
and
spooked
in
but
nobody
believed
his
yarn
about
it
no
they
thought
bruce
made
up
the
story
because
he
had
said
he
would
trick
them
if
he
could
yep
i
know
that
agreed
stebbins
eagerly
then
once
again
i
played
spook
and
that
time
miss
carnforth
was
a
sleepin
in
that
room
you
see
i
expected
it
would
be
one
o
the
men
and
when
i
see
a
woman
you
were
more
scared
than
she
was
zizi
leaned
eagerly
forward
almost
spilling
off
her
chair
in
her
interested
attention
i
believe
i
was
said
stebbins
solemnly
anyways
i
went
out
never
to
do
any
more
spook
work
and
i
never
did
all
that
tallies
with
my
discoveries
so
far
zizi
nodded
now
what
after
is
the
way
you
got
in
that
a
secret
and
stebbins
squirmed
uneasily
a
secret
entrance
you
mean
yes
and
how
to
get
into
it
is
a
secret
that
has
been
known
only
to
the
owner
of
that
house
for
generations
ever
since
it
was
built
whenever
anybody
bought
it
or
inherited
it
he
was
told
the
secret
entrance
and
sworn
never
to
tell
of
it
but
look
here
stebbins
your
entrance
to
that
house
or
whatever
it
is
was
seen
by
somebody
that
somebody
used
it
afterward
and
played
ghost
and
committed
crime
and
even
stole
the
body
of
that
poor
little
girl
away
also
some
one
carried
me
if
you
please
out
by
that
secret
passage
and
tried
to
drown
me
now
do
you
think
it
is
your
duty
to
remain
silent
because
of
that
old
oath
of
secrecy
zizi
had
risen
and
stood
over
him
like
a
small
but
terrifying
avenging
angel
if
she
had
brandished
a
flaming
sword
it
could
not
have
impressed
eli
stebbins
more
than
her
burning
black
eyes
glance
her
long
thin
arms
were
outspread
her
slim
body
poised
on
tiptoe
and
her
accusing
condemning
face
was
white
and
strained
in
its
earnestness
no
i
do
and
stebbins
rose
too
come
with
me
miss
go
with
you
and
i
show
you
that
secret
entrance
nobody
could
ever
find
it
alone
and
i
own
up
to
all
i
did
wrong
or
right
i
no
murderer
and
i
not
put
a
straw
in
the
way
of
findin
out
who
is
in
triumph
zizi
entered
the
hall
of
black
aspens
leading
her
captive
though
it
must
be
admitted
stebbins
came
willingly
this
here
my
house
he
said
with
an
air
of
importance
and
so
i
responsible
for
queer
goin
on
i
confess
and
after
that
you
detective
can
find
out
who
carried
on
the
thank
you
stebbins
said
pennington
wise
gravely
suppose
we
ask
all
the
members
of
the
household
to
be
present
at
your
revelations
not
the
thorpes
or
them
servant
maids
if
you
please
they
ai
none
of
implicated
and
why
let
know
what
goin
on
that
right
said
zizi
whatever
we
learn
may
not
be
entirely
given
to
the
public
just
call
the
rest
of
the
party
pen
as
it
happened
the
men
were
all
in
the
hall
talking
with
wise
when
stebbins
arrived
so
zizi
went
in
search
of
the
women
they
were
congregated
in
milly
room
and
as
they
came
downstairs
the
detective
noted
their
expressions
a
favourite
method
with
him
of
gaining
information
milly
round
little
face
was
so
red
and
swollen
with
weeping
that
it
excited
only
compassion
in
any
observer
norma
too
was
sad
and
but
eve
was
in
a
defiant
mood
and
her
scarlet
lips
were
curved
in
a
disdainful
smile
as
we
all
at
one
in
our
search
for
the
criminal
wise
began
tactfully
i
think
it
best
that
we
should
hear
all
together
stebbins
explanation
of
how
this
house
may
be
entered
from
outside
though
apparently
locked
and
bolted
against
intrusion
i
should
think
mr
wise
said
eve
scornfully
that
if
there
were
such
a
possibility
your
detective
genius
ought
to
have
discovered
it
he
could
said
stebbins
simply
it
ai
a
means
that
any
one
could
discover
then
how
did
the
criminal
find
it
out
demanded
eve
he
must
have
seen
me
come
in
by
it
stebbins
replied
nobody
could
ever
suspect
the
real
way
oh
come
now
said
zizi
mr
wise
does
know
he
is
not
at
all
vain
glorious
or
he
would
tell
you
himself
but
he
prefers
to
let
stebbins
tell
is
that
so
mr
wise
asked
professor
hardwick
eagerly
if
you
have
discovered
the
secret
entrance
i
wish
you
would
say
so
i
feel
chagrined
that
my
own
reasoning
powers
have
given
me
no
hint
i
have
satisfied
myself
of
the
means
and
the
location
of
the
entrance
wise
returned
but
i
have
not
examined
the
place
definitely
enough
to
find
the
hidden
spring
that
must
be
there
you
know
that
much
cried
stebbins
in
amazement
yes
largely
by
elimination
there
are
no
hollow
walls
no
false
locks
no
sliding
panels
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
logical
hidden
entrance
but
through
one
of
those
columns
and
he
pointed
to
the
great
bronze
columns
that
flanked
the
doorway
by
golly
and
stebbins
stared
at
the
speaker
you
hit
it
sir
i
could
of
course
find
the
secret
spring
which
must
be
concealed
in
the
ornamentation
wise
went
on
but
i
hesitated
to
draw
attention
to
the
columns
by
working
at
them
suppose
we
let
stebbins
tell
us
and
not
try
to
find
what
we
know
must
be
cleverly
concealed
but
wait
a
minute
pleaded
hardwick
i
terribly
interested
in
this
proof
of
mr
wise
perspicacity
you
need
touch
the
column
but
tell
us
your
theory
of
its
use
is
there
a
sliding
opening
in
the
solid
bronze
i
think
not
and
wise
smiled
i
may
be
all
wrong
i
really
looked
closely
but
my
belief
is
that
one
or
both
of
those
great
columns
which
as
you
see
are
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
hall
must
swing
round
revolve
you
know
and
so
open
a
way
out
exactly
right
and
stebbins
sprang
toward
the
column
that
was
on
the
side
of
the
hall
toward
the
room
with
the
tassels
that
the
secret
nobody
ever
so
much
as
dreamed
of
it
before
see
you
merely
press
this
acorn
in
this
bronze
oak
wreath
up
press
it
pretty
hard
and
the
column
swings
round
they
crowded
closer
to
see
and
learned
that
the
column
was
made
in
two
half
sections
one
in
the
hall
and
one
outside
these
again
were
divided
horizontally
about
seven
feet
above
the
floor
and
the
joint
concealed
by
a
decorative
wreath
of
bronze
oak
boughs
the
column
was
hollow
and
one
half
the
shaft
revolved
within
the
other
which
in
turn
revolved
over
the
first
so
that
by
successive
movements
of
the
two
one
could
pass
right
through
the
vestibule
wall
and
close
the
opening
after
him
leaving
no
trace
of
his
entry
or
exit
the
vestibule
wall
of
mahogany
concealed
the
longitudinal
joint
in
the
column
when
closed
the
doors
were
hinged
to
this
wooden
wall
and
were
opened
and
closed
and
locked
quite
independently
of
the
columns
owing
to
perfectly
adjusted
ball
bearings
and
a
thoroughly
oiled
condition
the
mechanism
worked
easily
and
soundlessly
the
whole
contraption
was
brought
from
italy
stebbins
informed
them
by
the
original
montgomery
i
do
think
he
ever
used
it
for
any
wrong
doings
though
they
do
say
soldiers
was
smuggled
through
in
war
times
and
contraband
smuggling
went
on
too
but
those
is
only
rumours
and
probably
exaggerated
you
exaggerated
the
ghost
stories
too
did
you
mr
stebbins
asked
wise
i
did
need
to
sir
those
yarns
of
the
shawled
woman
have
been
told
and
retold
so
many
years
now
they
grown
way
beyond
their
first
facts
if
there
ever
was
any
truth
to
this
here
column
only
one
of
revolves
has
always
been
kept
secret
but
when
the
little
witch
child
made
me
see
it
was
my
duty
to
tell
of
it
tell
of
it
i
did
now
sir
go
ahead
and
find
who
committed
them
dastardly
murders
and
i
consider
i
did
right
to
break
my
oath
of
secrecy
no
one
will
blame
you
for
it
said
professor
hardwick
who
was
still
experimenting
with
the
revolving
column
this
is
a
marvellous
piece
of
workmanship
landon
i
never
saw
such
before
pennington
wise
was
covertly
watching
all
the
faces
as
the
various
ones
peered
into
the
opening
left
when
the
column
was
turned
he
stood
on
guard
too
and
when
eve
curiously
bent
down
to
open
a
long
box
which
stood
up
on
end
against
the
inside
of
the
bronze
cylinder
he
reached
ahead
of
her
yes
he
said
consentingly
let
us
see
what
is
in
here
in
full
view
of
all
he
opened
the
long
box
such
a
box
as
long
stemmed
roses
might
have
been
packed
in
and
took
from
it
a
voluminous
cloak
of
thin
white
material
a
flimsy
white
shawl
and
a
mask
that
represented
a
skull
the
paraphernalia
of
the
shawled
woman
the
detective
said
exhibiting
the
things
your
property
mr
stebbins
yes
they
are
and
the
man
looked
but
determined
i
made
all
my
plans
before
the
folks
came
up
here
to
the
room
with
the
tassels
i
meant
no
harm
i
vow
i
thought
they
was
a
silly
set
of
society
folks
who
believed
in
spooks
and
i
thought
i
give
what
they
come
for
i
bought
the
mask
at
a
fancy
shop
in
town
and
the
thin
stuff
too
the
shawl
is
one
my
wife
used
to
have
i
own
up
to
all
my
doin
because
while
they
was
foolish
and
maybe
mean
they
criminal
now
if
so
be
somebody
saw
me
go
in
and
out
and
used
those
ghost
which
it
seems
they
must
have
done
i
help
all
i
can
to
fasten
the
guilt
where
it
belongs
i
too
declared
rudolph
braye
it
certainly
looks
as
if
some
one
had
seen
stebbins
enter
the
house
secretly
and
watching
saw
him
leave
then
this
night
prowler
tried
the
game
himself
yes
sir
replied
stebbins
just
the
same
sort
of
spring
inside
and
out
anybody
seein
me
go
through
either
way
could
easily
work
out
the
secret
but
not
knowing
of
it
nobody
ever
suspect
of
course
not
agreed
braye
now
we
have
a
start
let
us
get
to
work
on
the
more
serious
aspect
of
the
affair
for
while
this
revelation
explains
the
entrance
of
some
midnight
marauder
with
intent
to
frighten
us
it
does
do
much
toward
lessening
the
mystery
of
those
two
deaths
you
sure
stebbins
and
eve
turned
glittering
eyes
on
him
that
you
never
after
that
night
when
you
appeared
to
me
you
know
a
ghost
appeared
to
vernie
after
that
can
we
believe
that
was
not
the
work
of
the
same
malignant
malignant
is
not
the
word
to
apply
to
stebbins
pennington
wise
interrupted
her
and
it
is
up
to
us
to
me
to
find
who
took
his
place
as
haunter
of
this
house
also
who
it
was
that
removed
the
body
of
vernie
reid
doubtless
through
the
revolving
column
and
who
kidnapped
and
tried
to
drown
zizi
those
are
secondary
problems
said
braye
thoughtfully
gazing
at
the
detective
but
they
must
be
solved
too
of
course
what
i
more
anxious
about
however
is
to
learn
how
any
one
could
compass
the
murders
if
murders
they
were
of
course
they
were
said
hardwick
now
that
i
know
as
much
as
i
do
know
i
sure
we
learn
all
mr
wise
i
of
a
detective
bent
myself
and
you
may
count
on
me
to
help
you
all
i
can
you
laugh
my
dear
professor
hardwick
i
assure
you
i
no
thought
of
laughing
or
of
belittling
the
help
you
offer
i
truly
glad
of
your
assistance
and
it
is
my
habit
to
be
frank
with
my
clients
so
we
need
have
no
reservations
on
either
side
the
assurance
we
have
received
that
an
intruder
could
and
did
enter
the
house
gives
us
new
directions
in
which
to
look
and
new
theories
to
pursue
i
sure
you
will
all
agree
with
me
that
the
body
of
miss
reid
was
carried
out
through
the
secret
column
and
not
removed
by
supernatural
means
without
doubt
said
rudolph
braye
but
eve
carnforth
looked
a
denial
i
ca
agree
she
said
that
the
discovery
of
a
secret
entrance
disproves
all
possibility
of
the
presence
of
supernatural
agencies
i
think
no
human
intruder
can
be
held
responsible
for
all
we
have
been
through
how
do
you
account
for
two
deaths
occurring
at
the
very
moment
they
were
foretold
her
question
was
evidently
addressed
to
wise
and
he
replied
i
think
miss
carnforth
that
those
two
deaths
were
murders
cleverly
accomplished
by
human
wills
and
it
is
my
immediate
duty
to
prove
this
therefore
i
am
now
going
to
endeavour
to
recover
the
missing
body
of
the
unfortunate
girl
who
was
killed
what
vernie
body
and
eve
gasped
yes
and
not
wishing
to
do
anything
to
which
you
may
not
all
agree
i
announce
frankly
that
i
am
going
to
have
the
lake
dragged
the
lake
cried
wynne
landon
why
man
it
is
miles
long
but
i
think
that
the
same
person
who
tried
to
drown
zizi
is
responsible
for
the
disappearance
of
miss
reid
body
and
i
feel
sure
that
if
we
look
in
that
same
part
of
the
lake
we
will
find
what
we
are
after
incredible
exclaimed
landon
you
will
only
waste
your
time
wise
looked
closely
at
the
face
of
the
speaker
and
then
turned
quickly
to
observe
another
face
at
any
rate
it
can
do
no
harm
to
try
he
said
finally
not
at
all
said
braye
go
ahead
but
even
the
recovery
of
body
will
get
us
no
nearer
to
her
murderer
i
wish
i
had
been
here
at
the
time
of
those
deaths
while
i
can
not
feel
i
should
have
been
of
any
help
i
do
think
i
could
have
noticed
something
or
formed
some
opinion
or
conclusion
from
the
circumstances
no
rudolph
said
the
professor
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
or
deduced
from
anything
that
happened
at
that
time
i
was
nearest
to
bruce
miss
carnforth
was
nearest
to
vernie
neither
of
us
saw
anything
suspicious
or
of
unexplainable
intent
and
yet
bruce
was
poisoned
said
wise
glancing
from
one
face
to
another
and
i
feel
positive
miss
reid
was
also
poisoned
she
must
have
been
what
else
could
have
killed
her
like
that
true
enough
and
braye
nodded
his
head
but
do
you
think
an
examination
of
her
body
after
all
this
time
could
prove
that
whether
it
could
or
not
said
wise
we
want
to
recover
the
body
if
possible
my
theory
is
that
it
must
have
been
thrown
in
the
lake
if
it
was
taken
away
through
the
revolving
column
what
else
could
have
been
done
with
it
to
bury
it
would
have
been
to
risk
discovery
and
experience
are
you
sure
mr
wise
that
zizi
experience
was
truthfully
related
may
she
not
have
been
hysterically
nervous
and
imagined
the
whole
thing
i
heard
of
such
cases
who
put
you
up
to
that
idea
miss
carnforth
said
wise
very
quietly
and
eve
flushed
and
turned
aside
remaining
silent
pennington
wise
theory
proved
the
true
one
the
men
employed
to
drag
the
lake
at
black
aspens
succeeded
in
finding
the
body
of
vernie
reid
a
bag
of
bricks
had
been
tied
to
the
ankles
in
the
same
manner
as
described
by
zizi
and
the
little
form
had
been
sunk
in
almost
the
same
place
that
zizi
had
been
flung
into
the
water
reverent
hands
carried
the
body
to
the
house
and
later
it
was
examined
by
a
skilled
physician
from
new
york
city
he
reported
that
death
had
ensued
upon
the
girl
arm
being
scratched
with
some
sharp
implement
which
had
been
previously
dipped
in
a
powerful
poison
as
this
was
the
same
physician
who
had
passed
the
final
judgment
on
the
cause
of
bruce
death
his
report
was
listened
to
with
confidence
and
belief
you
must
know
he
said
to
the
awed
group
that
about
last
march
a
plot
was
formed
against
some
high
officials
in
england
these
diabolical
plans
included
the
use
of
extremely
poisonous
drugs
by
a
most
culpable
oversight
the
names
and
descriptions
of
these
poisons
crept
into
the
public
press
and
since
then
several
attempts
at
their
use
have
been
made
mostly
i
am
glad
to
say
without
result
but
it
is
clear
to
me
that
the
murderer
of
these
two
people
bruce
and
the
child
vernie
reid
used
the
poisons
i
have
told
you
of
i
read
about
them
said
pennington
wise
they
included
a
rare
drug
only
to
be
obtained
from
south
america
that
was
the
statement
said
the
doctor
but
i
credibly
informed
there
is
a
supply
secretly
hoarded
in
this
country
however
that
may
be
i
am
convinced
that
was
the
means
used
in
miss
reid
case
this
poison
must
be
introduced
under
the
skin
by
means
of
a
cut
or
scratch
whereupon
the
effect
is
instantaneously
fatal
twenty
seconds
is
said
to
be
the
extreme
length
of
time
for
life
to
remain
in
a
body
after
the
introduction
of
the
venom
there
is
a
distinct
scratch
on
miss
upper
right
arm
so
inflamed
and
poisoned
as
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
matter
that
why
the
body
was
removed
said
the
professor
lest
that
scratch
be
discovered
yes
agreed
wise
and
the
other
victim
bruce
was
killed
by
having
the
poison
introduced
into
his
stomach
that
was
a
different
poison
said
the
doctor
that
was
strychnine
hydrochlorate
which
acts
with
equal
speed
the
evidential
point
is
that
these
two
poisons
were
both
plotted
to
be
used
in
the
case
i
mentioned
in
england
which
however
was
foiled
before
it
was
actually
attempted
the
grave
wrong
was
the
account
in
the
newspapers
which
was
so
circumstantial
and
definite
as
to
give
information
to
whoever
cared
to
use
it
can
any
one
doubt
that
the
villain
in
this
case
read
the
article
i
speak
of
which
was
in
several
of
our
american
papers
and
made
use
of
his
directions
to
achieve
his
purpose
how
did
it
get
into
bruce
stomach
demanded
braye
it
was
secretly
placed
in
his
tea
or
in
the
cake
he
was
eating
declared
the
doctor
do
ask
me
how
or
who
did
it
that
is
not
my
province
but
whoever
could
plan
these
fearsome
deeds
could
find
an
ingenious
method
of
carrying
out
his
plans
of
that
i
sure
i
wish
i
been
present
said
braye
again
as
he
sighed
deeply
chapter
xviii
another
confession
pennington
wise
and
zizi
sat
in
the
hall
talking
it
was
part
of
policy
never
to
hold
secret
conclaves
with
his
little
assistant
for
he
said
that
the
people
who
employed
him
were
entitled
to
all
his
suspicions
or
deductions
as
they
took
shape
and
grew
in
his
mind
professor
hardwick
joined
them
as
wise
was
saying
what
first
turned
your
attention
to
the
room
with
the
tassels
ziz
why
did
you
move
into
that
room
to
sleep
because
the
lock
was
oiled
zizi
replied
her
black
eyes
glistening
the
first
time
i
got
a
chance
i
looked
at
all
the
locks
in
the
house
and
only
two
were
freshly
oiled
and
they
had
been
well
looked
after
i
can
tell
you
what
did
that
prove
to
you
hardwick
asked
that
somebody
was
haunting
the
room
with
the
tassels
who
had
to
open
the
door
to
get
in
no
ghost
would
need
to
turn
a
knob
and
open
the
door
they
splash
right
through
walls
or
anything
or
they
ought
to
if
they
know
their
business
but
this
lock
as
well
as
the
knob
was
oiled
and
as
you
know
the
door
was
opened
though
locked
on
the
inside
clever
fingers
can
turn
a
key
from
the
other
side
if
they
have
a
certain
implement
used
by
burglars
also
if
the
key
was
not
in
the
door
clever
people
could
provide
a
duplicate
key
but
these
things
are
not
necessary
for
ghosts
they
just
glide
in
serenely
not
even
thinking
about
keys
or
doors
you
right
child
and
wise
nodded
approvingly
at
her
now
what
other
door
had
its
lock
oiled
not
only
the
lock
but
the
hinges
of
one
of
the
bedroom
doors
were
carefully
oiled
you
know
which
one
penny
i
do
zizi
have
you
no
suspicion
professor
i
rather
not
say
as
a
friend
of
all
the
people
in
our
party
i
simply
ca
bring
myself
to
mention
the
name
of
any
one
of
them
and
yet
if
one
of
us
is
a
criminal
it
is
the
duty
of
the
others
to
see
justice
done
well
it
must
soon
come
out
anyway
it
is
tracy
door
is
it
zizi
yes
bless
my
soul
cried
the
professor
tracy
why
he
a
minister
no
and
penny
wise
shook
his
head
tracy
is
not
a
minister
and
never
was
on
the
contrary
he
about
as
far
removed
from
piety
of
any
sort
as
any
man
on
god
green
earth
what
are
you
saying
cried
eve
carnforth
coming
swiftly
toward
them
tracy
not
a
minister
no
repeated
wise
john
tracy
is
a
notorious
criminal
known
as
smug
johnny
by
his
friends
and
also
by
the
police
i
have
just
had
returns
from
some
inquiries
i
sent
to
chicago
and
i
learn
that
this
villain
is
wanted
on
several
counts
but
never
before
has
he
been
accused
of
murder
and
did
he
kill
bruce
and
vernie
cried
eve
her
hands
clenched
in
excitement
and
her
long
eyes
narrowed
with
fear
he
did
i
am
positive
we
have
yet
to
prove
it
but
i
have
evidence
enough
where
is
he
said
hardwick
abruptly
under
strict
surveillance
returned
wise
my
men
are
at
his
heels
day
and
night
he
ca
get
away
he
stole
me
said
zizi
you
see
i
had
my
eye
on
him
of
his
oiled
door
then
when
he
came
i
thought
he
was
only
going
to
scare
me
but
he
stuffed
that
old
chloroform
in
my
mouth
so
quick
i
could
even
yell
out
if
i
had
had
some
experience
in
swimming
pools
and
movie
thrillers
i
been
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
horrid
old
lake
this
minute
but
i
ca
understand
and
eve
looked
puzzled
why
would
tracy
kill
those
people
and
how
did
he
do
it
mr
wise
you
crazy
it
an
impossible
theory
others
had
gathered
in
the
hall
now
and
pennington
wise
told
them
all
of
his
recent
advices
from
chicago
that
proved
the
supposed
clergyman
a
fraud
and
a
villain
milly
showed
the
greatest
relief
oh
she
cried
i
glad
you
found
out
who
it
was
anyway
but
it
does
seem
as
if
tracy
could
be
a
bad
man
are
you
sure
mr
wise
yes
landon
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
now
let
us
reconstruct
the
scene
of
those
two
deaths
where
was
tracy
sitting
right
here
where
i
am
now
said
norma
thinking
back
vernie
was
over
there
near
the
front
door
bruce
was
across
the
hall
by
professor
hardwick
and
eve
was
in
the
middle
of
the
room
by
the
will
you
be
so
kind
miss
carnforth
as
to
think
very
carefully
said
wise
and
see
if
you
recollect
tracy
presence
near
you
as
you
were
fixing
the
various
cups
of
tea
did
he
have
the
slightest
opportunity
to
add
anything
to
the
cup
that
was
afterward
handed
to
mr
bruce
excited
almost
hysterical
eve
obeyed
the
detective
command
and
said
after
a
moment
thought
yes
he
did
i
remember
he
passed
near
me
and
vernie
stood
at
my
side
also
they
had
a
bit
of
banter
as
to
which
should
take
the
cup
i
had
just
poured
out
and
vernie
won
and
she
laughingly
carried
it
to
bruce
i
remember
it
distinctly
then
doubtless
at
that
moment
tracy
dropped
the
small
amount
of
poison
necessary
in
the
cup
sure
that
it
would
be
given
to
bruce
had
vernie
given
it
to
any
one
else
he
would
have
intercepted
it
he
is
a
man
of
suave
manners
you
know
yes
said
norma
particularly
so
and
very
graceful
about
any
social
matters
he
always
assisted
in
passing
the
tea
things
go
on
said
penny
wise
what
happened
as
bruce
took
his
first
sip
of
tea
he
changed
countenance
at
once
said
hardwick
i
was
talking
to
him
and
a
queer
pallor
came
over
his
face
and
then
it
turned
fiery
red
he
dropped
his
cup
and
one
moment
said
wise
what
became
of
that
broken
cup
i
no
idea
said
the
professor
helplessly
looking
about
him
i
was
home
began
milly
braye
and
i
had
gone
to
east
dryden
the
tray
was
taken
out
as
usual
interposed
eve
but
norma
said
quietly
i
picked
up
the
broken
bits
and
laid
them
on
the
tray
call
in
the
servant
who
took
away
that
tray
said
wise
shortly
old
thorpe
was
called
in
and
told
his
story
i
came
in
for
the
tray
he
said
and
seein
what
i
did
see
i
was
fair
knocked
out
i
did
as
usual
and
picked
up
the
tray
to
carry
it
to
the
kitchen
tracy
was
by
the
tray
at
the
time
and
he
was
hot
water
into
the
teacups
i
do
think
the
man
knew
what
he
was
about
none
of
us
did
and
small
wonder
thorpe
knew
nothing
of
the
recent
developments
regarding
tracy
and
wise
pursued
do
you
remember
whether
tracy
poured
hot
water
over
the
broken
cup
that
just
what
he
was
doin
sir
that
why
i
thought
he
rightly
know
what
he
was
about
you
may
go
thorpe
said
wise
you
see
he
continued
after
the
old
man
had
gone
tracy
poured
boiling
hot
water
from
the
afternoon
teakettle
over
the
broken
cup
that
all
evidence
of
poison
might
be
removed
if
the
bits
of
china
were
examined
i
not
heard
of
that
being
done
however
but
a
guilty
conscience
would
naturally
fear
it
that
little
incident
shows
the
astuteness
of
his
criminal
mind
it
does
cried
professor
hardwick
what
a
depraved
a
demoniacal
nature
must
be
his
where
did
he
come
from
who
introduced
him
to
our
party
i
did
said
rudolph
braye
i
had
of
course
no
suspicion
of
his
real
nature
i
met
tracy
on
the
train
travelling
from
chicago
to
new
york
about
a
year
ago
he
was
a
pleasant
smoking
room
companion
and
i
seen
him
several
times
since
in
new
york
i
had
no
reason
to
think
him
other
than
what
he
represented
himself
a
clergyman
with
a
church
in
chicago
he
impressed
me
as
a
fine
congenial
sort
and
when
landon
asked
me
to
suggest
another
member
for
our
house
party
i
thought
of
him
at
once
his
cloth
seemed
to
me
to
be
his
adequate
credentials
and
in
fact
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
his
possible
duplicity
nor
can
i
reconcile
the
facts
even
yet
how
do
you
know
these
things
mr
wise
are
you
not
romancing
a
little
no
braye
i
am
not
even
surmising
what
i
have
stated
is
true
because
there
is
no
other
possible
deduction
from
the
facts
i
have
learned
i
have
identified
the
man
tracy
who
was
here
with
you
as
the
notorious
smug
johnny
of
chicago
do
you
need
further
knowledge
of
him
to
believe
that
he
is
the
criminal
in
this
case
rather
than
one
of
your
own
immediate
circle
no
and
milly
shuddered
it
is
bad
enough
that
it
should
have
been
tracy
but
far
better
than
to
suspect
one
of
us
here
furthermore
continued
wise
let
us
look
into
the
details
of
the
death
of
vernie
reid
who
can
give
me
the
exact
facts
as
noticed
i
said
eve
carnforth
and
now
as
i
look
back
i
see
it
all
in
a
different
light
i
was
looking
at
bruce
as
everybody
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
crashing
china
and
i
heard
tracy
say
child
what
the
matter
or
some
such
words
then
he
ran
quickly
to
her
side
and
held
her
up
in
his
arms
while
i
ran
to
them
and
helped
him
to
lay
her
on
the
sofa
see
said
wise
at
the
moment
tracy
sprang
toward
the
girl
she
was
unharmed
and
as
he
put
his
arm
round
her
he
scratched
her
arm
with
a
sharp
pointed
instrument
which
had
been
dipped
in
the
awful
poison
that
we
have
learned
of
it
is
said
to
be
similar
to
that
with
which
the
barbarians
of
south
america
tip
their
arrows
but
the
least
scratch
is
instantly
fatal
and
proved
so
in
vernie
case
the
instrument
he
used
we
have
reason
to
think
was
a
steel
pen
why
do
you
think
that
asked
professor
hardwick
because
zizi
found
a
few
new
ones
in
tracy
room
that
had
not
been
used
for
writing
purposes
there
were
five
in
a
small
paper
parcel
we
have
found
that
he
bought
these
at
a
shop
in
the
village
buying
six
at
the
time
this
is
merely
a
shred
of
evidence
but
the
fact
that
zizi
found
the
pens
became
known
to
tracy
in
fact
he
caught
her
searching
his
room
it
was
this
that
made
him
try
to
do
away
with
the
child
tracy
do
away
with
zizi
exclaimed
braye
why
he
was
gone
away
from
here
then
no
he
had
left
the
house
but
he
was
lurking
about
and
after
all
had
retired
that
night
he
came
through
the
revolving
column
and
kidnapped
zizi
and
threw
her
into
the
lake
as
he
had
previously
thrown
in
the
body
of
vernie
reid
that
he
did
lest
the
scratch
on
her
arm
be
discovered
by
the
doctors
and
he
be
suspected
then
it
was
tracy
who
discovered
the
secret
of
the
revolving
column
said
braye
thoughtfully
you
take
a
great
deal
for
granted
mr
wise
i
take
nothing
for
granted
save
what
the
facts
prove
braye
that
tracy
used
the
revolving
column
is
positive
do
you
not
all
remember
the
night
when
professor
hardwick
saw
the
apparition
of
the
shawled
woman
on
that
night
tracy
was
supposed
to
be
in
boston
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
not
he
had
left
the
house
saying
he
was
going
to
boston
but
he
remained
in
hiding
near
the
house
played
ghost
and
went
on
his
way
i
was
in
new
york
that
night
said
braye
musingly
but
look
here
mr
wise
one
afternoon
about
dusk
miss
cameron
and
i
distinctly
saw
the
apparition
of
the
shawled
woman
in
the
room
with
the
tassels
when
we
ourselves
were
out
of
doors
we
saw
it
through
the
window
do
you
remember
norma
i
do
then
that
was
tracy
doings
also
declared
wise
how
simple
for
him
to
get
the
paraphernalia
from
the
column
where
it
was
always
in
readiness
make
his
appearance
to
frighten
you
two
and
then
return
the
shawl
and
so
forth
before
you
could
enter
and
catch
him
it
would
have
been
possible
agreed
braye
and
then
hardwick
began
there
were
many
other
strange
things
to
be
accounted
for
such
as
moanings
and
rustlings
in
the
morning
at
four
and
also
occasional
odours
of
prussic
acid
without
apparent
reason
lay
them
all
to
tracy
said
wise
you
wo
be
far
out
now
who
was
running
that
ouija
board
the
night
it
said
the
two
people
would
die
at
four
vernie
and
tracy
said
norma
but
when
it
said
that
tracy
took
his
hands
off
and
said
he
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
he
said
he
believed
vernie
pushed
it
to
those
letters
he
was
a
good
actor
said
wise
looking
grave
and
sighing
he
fooled
you
all
it
would
seem
he
certainly
fooled
me
good
and
plenty
said
braye
angrily
you
say
you
have
him
in
custody
mr
wise
i
did
not
say
that
but
i
have
him
under
such
surveillance
that
he
can
not
get
away
there
are
some
other
matters
to
be
discussed
granting
tracy
guilt
what
do
you
ascribe
as
a
motive
there
was
a
profound
silence
what
could
have
been
the
motive
for
a
perfect
stranger
to
kill
with
deliberation
two
people
who
had
never
injured
him
in
any
way
and
from
whose
death
he
could
expect
no
pecuniary
advantage
look
here
said
wynne
landon
suddenly
tracy
went
away
from
here
because
the
spectre
appeared
to
him
how
do
you
account
for
that
tracy
so
returned
wise
but
that
story
of
his
ghostly
vision
was
made
up
out
of
the
whole
cloth
which
was
all
of
the
with
which
he
ever
had
to
do
he
made
up
that
yarn
then
as
an
excuse
to
get
away
said
hardwick
he
did
just
that
replied
wise
but
what
has
any
one
to
suggest
as
tracy
motive
for
the
crimes
he
committed
plain
homicidal
mania
offered
hardwick
at
last
as
no
one
else
spoke
no
said
wise
john
tracy
is
not
of
that
type
such
people
are
abnormal
they
have
special
physical
characteristics
and
they
are
easily
recognized
once
suspicion
is
attached
to
them
tracy
is
a
quiet
even
debonair
character
he
is
and
though
deeply
clever
he
hides
it
under
a
mask
of
kindliness
and
consideration
victims
of
what
is
called
homicidal
mania
are
not
at
all
like
this
they
are
difficult
to
get
along
with
they
do
queer
inexplicable
things
and
most
of
all
they
show
in
their
faces
the
traits
that
lead
them
to
their
villainous
deeds
you
all
know
tracy
is
not
of
this
type
therefore
you
must
look
further
for
his
motive
did
he
receive
any
bequest
from
bruce
will
asked
hardwick
wonderingly
certainly
not
asserted
landon
he
did
know
bruce
until
we
came
up
here
and
that
would
have
been
no
motive
for
his
killing
vernie
nor
can
there
be
any
personal
motive
mr
wise
for
that
shall
we
not
have
to
ascribe
it
to
some
form
of
degeneracy
whether
that
seems
plausible
or
not
no
decreed
wise
looking
sternly
from
one
to
another
no
john
tracy
motive
for
those
two
inhuman
murders
was
the
motive
that
is
oftenest
the
reason
for
murder
money
lust
eve
carnforth
gave
a
scream
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
milly
landon
turned
white
and
swayed
as
if
about
to
faint
but
her
husband
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
supported
her
what
can
he
mean
said
norma
turning
to
braye
how
could
tracy
have
done
it
for
money
who
would
give
him
money
hush
norma
said
braye
in
a
low
voice
and
norma
remembered
it
was
the
same
tone
he
had
used
when
she
had
before
asked
questions
of
him
she
had
thought
over
his
words
on
that
occasion
and
had
concluded
he
meant
she
must
not
say
anything
that
seemed
to
throw
suspicion
toward
wynne
landon
she
looked
at
the
sobbing
milly
and
the
pained
strained
face
of
wynne
who
was
trying
to
soothe
her
and
then
norma
turned
to
eve
eve
was
using
all
her
will
power
to
preserve
her
poise
but
norma
saw
at
once
that
she
was
having
difficulty
to
do
so
in
kindness
of
heart
norma
went
over
to
the
suffering
girl
come
with
me
eve
she
said
softly
let
us
go
off
by
ourselves
for
a
while
yes
do
said
penny
wise
looking
kindly
at
the
two
girls
zizi
perhaps
you
can
be
of
use
zizi
followed
the
other
two
and
they
went
to
eve
room
with
all
the
deftness
of
a
nurse
zizi
found
some
aromatic
cologne
and
a
fresh
handkerchief
and
in
a
moment
was
bathing
eve
temples
with
a
gentle
soothing
touch
what
a
funny
little
piece
you
are
said
eve
looking
at
the
small
sympathetic
face
and
speaking
in
a
preoccupied
way
yes
acquiesced
zizi
while
norma
sat
by
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
tell
me
said
eve
suddenly
roused
to
energy
tell
me
zizi
you
know
as
much
as
mr
wise
does
tell
me
who
paid
tracy
money
what
cried
norma
eve
hush
do
say
such
things
if
anybody
did
we
do
want
to
know
it
we
have
to
know
it
said
eve
simply
and
norma
but
norma
interrupted
her
no
eve
we
do
have
to
at
least
we
have
to
ask
about
it
or
inquire
into
it
the
detective
will
do
that
you
soon
to
know
said
zizi
quietly
indeed
you
know
now
do
you
miss
carnforth
i
asked
you
cried
eve
hysterical
again
tell
me
tell
me
at
once
girl
but
zizi
shook
her
head
and
continued
to
bathe
eve
brow
try
to
be
calm
she
whispered
there
will
be
much
for
you
to
bear
and
you
must
be
brave
to
bear
it
eve
looked
at
her
wonderingly
and
seeing
deep
compassion
in
the
black
eyes
she
ceased
questioning
and
closed
her
own
eyes
after
a
few
moments
she
opened
her
eyes
and
rose
from
her
couch
thank
you
zizi
she
said
i
am
all
right
now
i
am
going
back
to
join
the
others
will
you
come
norma
dazedly
as
one
in
a
dream
norma
rose
and
the
three
went
down
stairs
apparently
little
had
been
said
of
importance
since
they
left
there
was
a
tense
silence
and
pennington
wise
said
i
find
i
must
speak
out
and
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
hoped
for
a
confession
but
i
see
no
signs
of
it
i
was
not
strictly
speaking
employed
by
any
one
of
you
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
investigate
this
case
because
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
remarkable
one
i
had
ever
heard
of
i
wrote
to
professor
hardwick
for
information
concerning
it
and
finally
i
arranged
to
come
up
here
i
brought
zizi
because
she
is
invaluable
to
me
in
collecting
evidence
her
quick
wit
and
her
dainty
personality
can
compass
effects
that
i
can
not
i
feel
therefore
that
it
is
to
professor
hardwick
that
i
should
make
my
direct
report
but
as
you
are
all
interested
i
will
ask
any
of
you
who
choose
to
do
so
to
remain
and
listen
the
others
may
be
excused
of
course
we
all
stay
exclaimed
landon
we
all
quite
as
much
interested
as
professor
hardwick
can
possibly
be
more
so
indeed
for
the
victims
of
the
crime
are
not
relatives
of
his
very
well
returned
wise
stay
then
all
of
you
the
story
is
not
a
long
one
though
it
is
a
deeply
sad
one
john
tracy
was
hired
basely
hired
to
commit
those
two
murders
the
man
who
hired
him
is
of
course
the
greater
criminal
though
his
hands
are
unstained
with
actual
blood
the
man
who
hired
the
assassin
is
naturally
the
man
who
desired
the
large
fortune
of
gifford
bruce
and
who
realized
that
unless
two
people
were
removed
from
earth
he
could
not
inherit
need
i
say
more
you
need
not
said
rudolph
braye
i
confess
the
plan
was
tracy
the
suggestion
was
his
he
tempted
me
by
telling
me
that
he
had
read
of
a
plan
by
which
people
could
be
put
to
death
and
leave
no
possible
trace
he
said
that
i
would
eventually
inherit
the
fortune
and
that
i
ought
to
have
it
while
i
was
young
enough
to
enjoy
it
he
said
he
would
do
the
deed
and
i
need
know
nothing
about
it
nor
be
present
at
the
time
i
am
not
shifting
the
blame
i
am
merely
telling
you
the
facts
braye
spoke
in
a
monotone
his
eyes
on
the
floor
his
hands
nervously
twitching
a
hundred
times
i
regretted
our
plans
a
hundred
times
i
begged
tracy
to
give
up
the
project
but
he
held
me
to
it
and
said
if
i
petered
out
he
would
tell
the
whole
story
when
the
plan
for
coming
up
here
was
started
tracy
made
me
get
him
invited
saying
it
was
an
ideal
opportunity
i
did
think
he
would
really
carry
out
his
intentions
and
as
the
ghost
seemed
really
to
appear
i
watched
to
discover
the
means
i
did
see
stebbins
enter
through
the
revolving
column
and
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
how
it
worked
i
showed
this
to
tracy
he
made
me
do
so
and
when
i
went
to
new
york
he
played
ghost
and
appeared
to
little
vernie
again
and
again
i
plead
with
him
to
give
up
the
fearful
scheme
but
he
refused
to
do
so
the
day
i
went
to
east
dryden
with
milly
i
had
no
idea
that
he
intended
to
do
the
deed
but
he
did
i
had
promised
him
half
the
fortune
and
he
had
declared
that
there
could
be
no
suspicion
of
either
of
us
he
said
if
there
were
any
suspicion
it
would
be
directed
toward
wynne
i
make
no
excuses
i
voice
no
cry
for
forgiveness
or
for
leniency
but
i
hereby
pay
the
penalty
braye
swallowed
what
was
evidently
a
portion
of
the
same
poison
that
had
killed
gifford
bruce
and
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
a
dead
man
john
tracy
was
arrested
and
received
his
just
deserts
wynne
landon
inherited
the
fortune
and
though
it
had
painful
associations
he
and
milly
went
away
from
black
aspens
never
to
return
and
in
time
lived
down
the
sad
and
awful
memories
you
see
penny
zizi
summed
up
a
criminal
always
slips
up
on
some
minor
count
if
the
tracy
person
had
oiled
his
door
and
the
door
of
that
haunted
room
so
carefully
or
if
he
had
the
wit
to
oil
some
other
doors
too
we
might
have
overlooked
him
as
a
possible
suspect
eh
i
do
think
so
ziz
neither
do
i
penny
wise
transcriber
note
obvious
typographical
errors
were
corrected
without
note
spellings
and
dialect
were
left
unchanged
