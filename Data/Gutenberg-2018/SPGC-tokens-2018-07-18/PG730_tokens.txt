treats
of
the
place

oliver

was
born
and
of
the
circumstances
attending
his
birth
among
other
public
buildings
in
a
certain
town
which
for
many
reasons
it
will
be
prudent
to
refrain
from
mentioning
and
to
which
i
will
assign
no
fictitious
name
there
is
one
anciently
common
to
most
towns
great
or
small
to
wit
a
workhouse
and
in
this
workhouse
was
born
on
a
day
and
date
which
i
need
not
trouble
myself
to
repeat
inasmuch
as
it
can
be
of
no
possible
consequence
to
the
reader
in
this
stage
of
the
business
at
all
events
the
item
of
mortality
whose
name
is
prefixed
to
the
head
of
this
chapter
for
a
long
time
after
it
was
ushered
into
this
world
of
sorrow
and
trouble
by
the
parish
surgeon
it
remained
a
matter
of
considerable
doubt
whether
the
child
would
survive
to
bear
any
name
at
all
in
which
case
it
is
somewhat
more
than
probable
that
these
memoirs
would
never
have
appeared
or
if
they
had
that
being
comprised
within
a
couple
of
pages
they
would
have
possessed
the
inestimable
merit
of
being
the
most
concise
and
faithful
specimen
of
biography
extant
in
the
literature
of
any
age
or
country
although
i
am
not
disposed
to
maintain
that
the
being
born
in
a
workhouse
is
in
itself
the
most
fortunate
and
enviable
circumstance
that
can
possibly
befall
a
human
being
i
do
mean
to
say
that
in
this
particular
instance
it
was
the
best
thing
for
oliver
twist
that
could
by
possibility
have
occurred
the
fact
is
that
there
was
considerable
difficulty
in
inducing
oliver
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
respiration
a
troublesome
practice
but
one
which
custom
has
rendered
necessary
to
our
easy
existence
and
for
some
time
he
lay
gasping
on
a
little
flock
mattress
rather
unequally
poised
between
this
world
and
the
next
the
balance
being
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
latter
now
if
during
this
brief
period
oliver
had
been
surrounded
by
careful
grandmothers
anxious
aunts
experienced
nurses
and
doctors
of
profound
wisdom
he
would
most
inevitably
and
indubitably
have
been
killed
in
no
time
there
being
nobody
by
however
but
a
pauper
old
woman
who
was
rendered
rather
misty
by
an
unwonted
allowance
of
beer
and
a
parish
surgeon
who
did
such
matters
by
contract
oliver
and
nature
fought
out
the
point
between
them
the
result
was
that
after
a
few
struggles
oliver
breathed
sneezed
and
proceeded
to
advertise
to
the
inmates
of
the
workhouse
the
fact
of
a
new
burden
having
been
imposed
upon
the
parish
by
setting
up
as
loud
a
cry
as
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
from
a
male
infant
who
had
not
been
possessed
of
that
very
useful
appendage
a
voice
for
a
much
longer
space
of
time
than
three
minutes
and
a
quarter
as
oliver
gave
this
first
proof
of
the
free
and
proper
action
of
his
lungs
the
patchwork
coverlet
which
was
carelessly
flung
over
the
iron
bedstead
rustled
the
pale
face
of
a
young
woman
was
raised
feebly
from
the
pillow
and
a
faint
voice
imperfectly
articulated
the
words
me
see
the
child
and
die
the
surgeon
had
been
sitting
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
fire
giving
the
palms
of
his
hands
a
warm
and
a
rub
alternately
as
the
young
woman
spoke
he
rose
and
advancing
to
the
bed
head
said
with
more
kindness
than
might
have
been
expected
of
him
you
must
not
talk
about
dying
yet
bless
her
dear
heart
no
interposed
the
nurse
hastily
depositing
in
her
pocket
a
green
glass
bottle
the
contents
of
which
she
had
been
tasting
in
a
corner
with
evident
satisfaction
bless
her
dear
heart
when
she
has
lived
as
long
as
i
have
sir
and
had
thirteen
children
of
her
own
and
all
on
dead
except
two
and
them
in
the
wurkus
with
me
she
know
better
than
to
take
on
in
that
way
bless
her
dear
heart
think
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
there
a
dear
young
lamb
do
apparently
this
consolatory
perspective
of
a
mother
prospects
failed
in
producing
its
due
effect
the
patient
shook
her
head
and
stretched
out
her
hand
towards
the
child
the
surgeon
deposited
it
in
her
arms
she
imprinted
her
cold
white
lips
passionately
on
its
forehead
passed
her
hands
over
her
face
gazed
wildly
round
shuddered
fell
back
and
died
they
chafed
her
breast
hands
and
temples
but
the
blood
had
stopped
forever
they
talked
of
hope
and
comfort
they
had
been
strangers
too
long
all
over
mrs
thingummy
said
the
surgeon
at
last
poor
dear
so
it
is
said
the
nurse
picking
up
the
cork
of
the
green
bottle
which
had
fallen
out
on
the
pillow
as
she
stooped
to
take
up
the
child
dear
need
mind
sending
up
to
me
if
the
child
cries
nurse
said
the
surgeon
putting
on
his
gloves
with
great
deliberation
very
likely
it
be
troublesome
give
it
a
little
gruel
if
it
is
he
put
on
his
hat
and
pausing
by
the
on
his
way
to
the
door
added
was
a
girl
too
where
did
she
come
from
was
brought
here
last
night
replied
the
old
woman
the
overseer
order
she
was
found
lying
in
the
street
she
had
walked
some
distance
for
her
shoes
were
worn
to
pieces
but
where
she
came
from
or
where
she
was
going
to
nobody
knows
the
surgeon
leaned
over
the
body
and
raised
the
left
hand
old
story
he
said
shaking
his
head
i
see
ah
the
medical
gentleman
walked
away
to
dinner
and
the
nurse
having
once
more
applied
herself
to
the
green
bottle
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
before
the
fire
and
proceeded
to
dress
the
infant
what
an
excellent
example
of
the
power
of
dress
young
oliver
twist
was
wrapped
in
the
blanket
which
had
hitherto
formed
his
only
covering
he
might
have
been
the
child
of
a
nobleman
or
a
beggar
it
would
have
been
hard
for
the
haughtiest
stranger
to
have
assigned
him
his
proper
station
in
society
but
now
that
he
was
enveloped
in
the
old
calico
robes
which
had
grown
yellow
in
the
same
service
he
was
badged
and
ticketed
and
fell
into
his
place
at
once
a
parish
child
the
orphan
of
a
workhouse
the
humble
drudge
to
be
cuffed
and
buffeted
through
the
world
despised
by
all
and
pitied
by
none
oliver
cried
lustily
if
he
could
have
known
that
he
was
an
orphan
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
and
overseers
perhaps
he
would
have
cried
the
louder
chapter
ii
treats
of
oliver
twist
growth
education
and
board
for
the
next
eight
or
ten
months
oliver
was
the
victim
of
a
systematic
course
of
treachery
and
deception
he
was
brought
up
by
hand
the
hungry
and
destitute
situation
of
the
infant
orphan
was
duly
reported
by
the
workhouse
authorities
to
the
parish
authorities
the
parish
authorities
inquired
with
dignity
of
the
workhouse
authorities
whether
there
was
no
female
then
domiciled
in
house
who
was
in
a
situation
to
impart
to
oliver
twist
the
consolation
and
nourishment
of
which
he
stood
in
need
the
workhouse
authorities
replied
with
humility
that
there
was
not
upon
this
the
parish
authorities
magnanimously
and
humanely
resolved
that
oliver
should
be
or
in
other
words
that
he
should
be
dispatched
to
a
some
three
miles
off
where
twenty
or
thirty
other
juvenile
offenders
against
the
rolled
about
the
floor
all
day
without
the
inconvenience
of
too
much
food
or
too
much
clothing
under
the
parental
superintendence
of
an
elderly
female
who
received
the
culprits
at
and
for
the
consideration
of
per
small
head
per
week
worth
per
week
is
a
good
round
diet
for
a
child
a
great
deal
may
be
got
for
quite
enough
to
overload
its
stomach
and
make
it
uncomfortable
the
elderly
female
was
a
woman
of
wisdom
and
experience
she
knew
what
was
good
for
children
and
she
had
a
very
accurate
perception
of
what
was
good
for
herself
so
she
appropriated
the
greater
part
of
the
weekly
stipend
to
her
own
use
and
consigned
the
rising
parochial
generation
to
even
a
shorter
allowance
than
was
originally
provided
for
them
thereby
finding
in
the
lowest
depth
a
deeper
still
and
proving
herself
a
very
great
experimental
philosopher
everybody
knows
the
story
of
another
experimental
philosopher
who
had
a
great
theory
about
a
horse
being
able
to
live
without
eating
and
who
demonstrated
it
so
well
that
he
had
got
his
own
horse
down
to
a
straw
a
day
and
would
unquestionably
have
rendered
him
a
very
spirited
and
rampacious
animal
on
nothing
at
all
if
he
had
not
died
hours
before
he
was
to
have
had
his
first
comfortable
bait
of
air
unfortunately
for
the
experimental
philosophy
of
the
female
to
whose
protecting
care
oliver
twist
was
delivered
over
a
similar
result
usually
attended
the
operation
of
system
for
at
the
very
moment
when
the
child
had
contrived
to
exist
upon
the
smallest
possible
portion
of
the
weakest
possible
food
it
did
perversely
happen
in
eight
and
a
half
cases
out
of
ten
either
that
it
sickened
from
want
and
cold
or
fell
into
the
fire
from
neglect
or
got
by
accident
in
any
one
of
which
cases
the
miserable
little
being
was
usually
summoned
into
another
world
and
there
gathered
to
the
fathers
it
had
never
known
in
this
occasionally
when
there
was
some
more
than
usually
interesting
inquest
upon
a
parish
child
who
had
been
overlooked
in
turning
up
a
bedstead
or
inadvertently
scalded
to
death
when
there
happened
to
be
a
washing
though
the
latter
accident
was
very
scarce
anything
approaching
to
a
washing
being
of
rare
occurrence
in
the
farm
the
jury
would
take
it
into
their
heads
to
ask
troublesome
questions
or
the
parishioners
would
rebelliously
affix
their
signatures
to
a
remonstrance
but
these
impertinences
were
speedily
checked
by
the
evidence
of
the
surgeon
and
the
testimony
of
the
beadle
the
former
of
whom
had
always
opened
the
body
and
found
nothing
inside
which
was
very
probable
indeed
and
the
latter
of
whom
invariably
swore
whatever
the
parish
wanted
which
was
very
besides
the
board
made
periodical
pilgrimages
to
the
farm
and
always
sent
the
beadle
the
day
before
to
say
they
were
going
the
children
were
neat
and
clean
to
behold
when
went
and
what
more
would
the
people
have
it
can
not
be
expected
that
this
system
of
farming
would
produce
any
very
extraordinary
or
luxuriant
crop
oliver
twist
ninth
birthday
found
him
a
pale
thin
child
somewhat
diminutive
in
stature
and
decidedly
small
in
circumference
but
nature
or
inheritance
had
implanted
a
good
sturdy
spirit
in
oliver
breast
it
had
had
plenty
of
room
to
expand
thanks
to
the
spare
diet
of
the
establishment
and
perhaps
to
this
circumstance
may
be
attributed
his
having
any
ninth
at
all
be
this
as
it
may
however
it
was
his
ninth
birthday
and
he
was
keeping
it
in
the
with
a
select
party
of
two
other
young
gentleman
who
after
participating
with
him
in
a
sound
thrashing
had
been
locked
up
for
atrociously
presuming
to
be
hungry
when

good
lady
of

house

startled

apparition

them
two
brats
upstairs
and
wash
directly
my
heart
alive
bumble
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
now
bumble
was
a
fat
man
and
a
choleric
so
instead
of
responding
to
this
salutation
in
a
kindred
spirit
he
gave
the
little
wicket
a
tremendous
shake
and
then
bestowed
upon
it
a
kick
which
could
have
emanated
from
no
leg
but
a
beadle
only
think
said
mann
running
out
for
the
three
boys
had
been
removed
by
this
time
think
of
that
that
i
should
have
forgotten
that
the
gate
was
bolted
on
the
inside
on
account
of
them
dear
children
walk
in
sir
walk
in
pray
bumble
do
sir
although
this
invitation
was
accompanied
with
a
curtsey
that
might
have
softened
the
heart
of
a
it
by
no
means
mollified
the
beadle
you
think
this
respectful
or
proper
conduct
mann
inquired
bumble
grasping
his
cane

parish
officers

waiting

come
here
upon
porochial
business

porochial
orphans

mann
that

as
i
may
say
a
porochial
delegate
and
a
stipendiary
sure
bumble
that
i
was
only
a
telling
one
or
two
of
the
dear
children
as
is
so
fond
of
you
that
it
was
you
a
coming
replied
mann
with
great
humility
bumble
had
a
great
idea
of
his
oratorical
powers
and
his
importance
he
had
displayed
the
one
and
vindicated
the
other
he
relaxed
well
mann
he
replied
in
a
calmer
tone
may
be
as
you
say
it
may
be
lead
the
way
in
mann
for
i
come
on
business
and
have
something
to
say
mann
ushered
the
beadle
into
a
small
parlour
with
a
brick
floor
placed
a
seat
for
him
and
officiously
deposited
his
cocked
hat
and
cane
on
the
table
before
him
bumble
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
walk
had
engendered
glanced
complacently
at
the
cocked
hat
and
smiled
yes
he
smiled
beadles
are
but
men
and
bumble
smiled
do
you
be
offended
at
what
i
a
going
to
say
observed
mann
with
captivating
sweetness
had
a
long
walk
you
know
or
i
would
mention
it
now
will
you
take
a
little
drop
of
somethink

bumble

drop
said
bumble
waving
his
right
hand
in
a
dignified
but
placid
manner
think
you
will
said
mann
who
had
noticed
the
tone
of
the
refusal
and
the
gesture
that
had
accompanied
it
a
leetle
drop
with
a
little
cold
water
and
a
lump
of
sugar
bumble
coughed
just
a
leetle
drop
said
mann
persuasively
is
it
inquired
the
beadle
it
what
i
obliged
to
keep
a
little
of
in
the
house
to
put
into
the
blessed
infants
daffy
when
they

replied

she
opened
a
corner
cupboard
and
took
down
a
bottle
and
glass
gin
i
not
deceive
you
b
it
gin

mrs

inquired
bumble
following
with
his
eyes
the
interesting
process
of
mixing
bless
that
i
do
dear
as
it
is
replied
the
nurse

very
eyes

said
bumble
approvingly
you
could
not
you
are
a
humane
woman
mrs
mann
here
she
set
down
the
glass
shall
take
a
early
opportunity
of
mentioning
it
to
the
board
mrs
mann
he
drew
it
towards
him
feel
as
a
mother
mrs
mann
he
stirred
the
i
drink
your
health
with
cheerfulness
mann
and
he
swallowed
half
of
it
now
about
business
said
the
beadle
taking
out
a
leathern
child
that
was
oliver
twist
is
nine
year
old
him
interposed
mann
inflaming
her
left
eye
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
notwithstanding
a
offered
reward
of
ten
pound
which
was
afterwards
increased
to
twenty
pound
notwithstanding
the
most
superlative
and
i
may
say
exertions
on
the
part
of
this
parish
said
bumble
have
never
been
able
to
discover
who
is
his
father
or
what
was
his
mother
settlement
name
or
condition
mann
raised
her
hands
in
astonishment
but
added
after
a
reflection
comes
he
to
have
any
name
at
all
then
the
beadle
drew
himself
up
with
great
pride
and
said
inwented
it
mr
bumble
mann

name
our
fondlings
in
alphabetical
order
the
last

a

swubble

i
have
got
names
ready
made
to
the
end
of
the
alphabet
and
all
the
way
through
it
again
when
we
come
to
z
you
quite
a
literary
character
sir
said
mann
well
said
the
beadle
evidently
gratified
with
the
compliment
i
may
be
perhaps
i
may
be
mrs
mann
he
finished
the
and
added
being
now
too
old
to
remain
here
the
board
have
determined
to
have
him
back
into
the
house
i
have
come
out
myself
to
take
him
there
so
let
me
see
him
at
once
fetch
him
directly
said
mann
leaving
the
room
for
that
purpose
oliver
having
had
by
this
time
as
much
of
the
outer
coat
of
dirt
which
encrusted
his
face
and
hands
removed
as
could
be
scrubbed
off
in
one
washing
was
led
into
the
room
by
his
benevolent
protectress
a
bow
to
the
gentleman
oliver
said
mann
oliver
made
a
bow
which
was
divided
between
the
beadle
on
the
chair
and
the
cocked
hat
on
the
table
you
go
along
with
me
oliver
said
bumble
in
a
majestic
voice
oliver
was
about
to
say
that
he
would
go
along
with
anybody
with
great
readiness
when
glancing
upward
he
caught
sight
of
mann
who
had
got
behind
the
beadle
chair
and
was
shaking
her
fist
at
him
with
a
furious
countenance
he
took
the
hint
at
once
for
the
fist
had
been
too
often
impressed
upon
his
body
not
to
be
deeply
impressed
upon
his
recollection
she
go
with
me
inquired
poor
oliver
she
ca
replied
bumble
she
come
and
see
you
sometimes
this
was
no
very
great
consolation
to
the
child
young
as
he
was
however
he
had
sense
enough
to
make
a
feint
of
feeling
great
regret
at
going
away
it
was
no
very
difficult
matter
for
the
boy
to
call
tears
into
his
eyes
hunger
and
recent
are
great
assistants
if
you
want
to
cry
and
oliver
cried
very
naturally
indeed
mann
gave
him
a
thousand
embraces
and
what
oliver
wanted
a
great
deal
more
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
less
he
should
seem
too
hungry
when
he
got
to
the
workhouse
with
the
slice
of
bread
in
his
hand
and
the
little
parish
cap
on
his
head
oliver
was
then
led
away
by
bumble
from
the
wretched
home
where
one
kind
word
or
look
had
never
lighted
the
gloom
of
his
infant
years
and
yet
he
burst
into
an
agony
of
childish
grief
as
the
closed
after
him
wretched
as
were
the
little
companions
in
misery
he
was
leaving
behind
they
were
the
only
friends
he
had
ever
known
and
a
sense
of
his
loneliness
in
the
great
wide
world
sank
into
the
child
heart
for
the
first
time
bumble
walked
on
with
long
strides
little
oliver
firmly
grasping
his
cuff
trotted
beside
him
inquiring
at
the
end
of
every
quarter
of
a
mile
whether
they
were
there
to
these
interrogations
bumble
returned
very
brief
and
snappish
replies
for
the
temporary
blandness
which
awakens
in
some
bosoms
had
by
this
time
evaporated
and
he
was
once
again
a
beadle
oliver
had
not
been
within
the
walls
of
the
workhouse
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
had
scarcely
completed
the
demolition
of
a
second
slice
of
bread
when
bumble
who
had
handed
him
over
to
the
care
of
an
old
woman
returned
and
telling
him
it
was
a
board
night
informed
him
that
the
board
had
said
he
was
to
appear
before
it
forthwith
not
having
a
very
clearly
defined
notion
of
what
a
live
board
was
oliver
was
rather
astounded
by
this
intelligence
and
was
not
quite
certain
whether
he
ought
to
laugh
or
cry
he
had
no
time
to
think
about
the
matter
however
for
bumble
gave
him
a
tap
on
the
head
with
his
cane
to
wake
him
up
and
another
on
the
back
to
make
him
lively
and
bidding
him
to
follow
conducted
him
into
a
large
room
where
eight
or
ten
fat
gentlemen
were
sitting
round
a
table
at
the
top
of
the
table
seated
in
an
rather
higher
than
the
rest
was
a
particularly
fat
gentleman
with
a
very
round
red
face
to
the
board
said
bumble
oliver
brushed
away
two
or
three
tears
that
were
lingering
in
his
eyes
and
seeing
no
board
but
the
table
fortunately
bowed
to
that
your
name
boy
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
oliver
was
frightened
at
the
sight
of
so
many
gentlemen
which
made
him
tremble
and
the
beadle
gave
him
another
tap
behind
which
made
him
cry
these
two
causes
made
him
answer
in
a
very
low
and
hesitating
voice
whereupon
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
said
he
was
a
fool
which
was
a
capital
way
of
raising
his
spirits
and
putting
him
quite
at
his
ease
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
to
me
you
know
you
an
orphan
i
suppose
that
sir
inquired
poor
oliver
boy
a
fool
i
thought
he
was
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
first
know
you
got
no
father
or
mother
and
that
you
were
brought
up
by
the
parish
you
sir
replied
oliver
weeping
bitterly
are
you
crying
for
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
and
to
be
sure
it
was
very
extraordinary
what
the
boy
be
crying
for
hope
you
say
your
prayers
every
night
said
another
gentleman
in
a
gruff
voice
pray
for
the
people
who
feed
you
and
take
care
of
you
like
a
christian
sir
stammered
the
boy
the
gentleman
who
spoke
last
was
unconsciously
right
it
would
have
been
very
like
a
christian
and
a
marvellously
good
christian
too
if
oliver
had
prayed
for
the
people
who
fed
and
took
care
of
but
he
had
because
nobody
had
taught
him
you
have
come
here
to
be
educated
and
taught
a
useful
trade
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
you
begin
to
pick
oakum
morning
at
six
added
the
surly
one
in
the
white
waistcoat
for
the
combination
of
both
these
blessings
in
the
one
simple
process
of
picking
oakum
oliver
bowed
low
by
the
direction
of
the
beadle
and
was
then
hurried
away
to
a
large
ward
where
on
a
rough
hard
bed
he
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
what
a
novel
illustration
of
the
tender
laws
of
england
they
let
the
paupers
go
to
sleep
poor
oliver
he
little
thought
as
he
lay
sleeping
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
all
around
him
that
the
board
had
that
very
day
arrived
at
a
decision
which
would
exercise
the
most
material
influence
over
all
his
future
fortunes
but
they
had
and
this
was
it
the
members
of
this
board
were
very
sage
deep
philosophical
men
and
when
they
came
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
workhouse
they
found
out
at
once
what
ordinary
folks
would
never
have
discovered
the
poor
people
liked
it
it
was
a
regular
place
of
public
entertainment
for
the
poorer
classes
a
tavern
where
there
was
nothing
to
pay
a
public
breakfast
dinner
tea
and
supper
all
the
year
round
a
brick
and
mortar
elysium
where
it
was
all
play
and
no
work
said
the
board
looking
very
knowing
are
the
fellows
to
set
this
to
rights
we
stop
it
all
in
no
time
so
they
established
the
rule
that
all
poor
people
should
have
the
alternative
for
they
would
compel
nobody
not
they
of
being
starved
by
a
gradual
process
in
the
house
or
by
a
quick
one
out
of
it
with
this
view
they
contracted
with
the
to
lay
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
water
and
with
a
to
supply
periodically
small
quantities
of
oatmeal
and
issued
three
meals
of
thin
gruel
a
day
with
an
onion
twice
a
week
and
half
a
roll
of
sundays
they
made
a
great
many
other
wise
and
humane
regulations
having
reference
to
the
ladies
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
kindly
undertook
to
divorce
poor
married
people
in
consequence
of
the
great
expense
of
a
suit
in
doctors
commons
and
instead
of
compelling
a
man
to
support
his
family
as
they
had
theretofore
done
took
his
family
away
from
him
and
made
him
a
bachelor
there
is
no
saying
how
many
applicants
for
relief
under
these
last
two
heads
might
have
started
up
in
all
classes
of
society
if
it
had
not
been
coupled
with
the
workhouse
but
the
board
were
men
and
had
provided
for
this
difficulty
the
relief
was
inseparable
from
the
workhouse
and
the
gruel
and
that
frightened
people
for
the
first
six
months
after
oliver
twist
was
removed
the
system
was
in
full
operation
it
was
rather
expensive
at
first
in
consequence
of
the
increase
in
the
undertaker
bill
and
the
necessity
of
taking
in
the
clothes
of
all
the
paupers
which
fluttered
loosely
on
their
wasted
shrunken
forms
after
a
week
or
two
gruel
but
the
number
of
workhouse
inmates
got
thin
as
well
as
the
paupers
and
the
board
were
in
ecstasies
the
room
in
which
the
boys
were
fed
was
a
large
stone
hall
with
a
copper
at
one
end
out
of
which
the
master
dressed
in
an
apron
for
the
purpose
and
assisted
by
one
or
two
women
ladled
the
gruel
at
mealtimes
of
this
festive
composition
each
boy
had
one
porringer
and
no
more
except
on
occasions
of
great
public
rejoicing
when
he
had
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
besides
the
bowls
never
wanted
washing
the
boys
polished
them
with
their
spoons
till
they
shone
again
and
when
they
had
performed
this
operation
which
never
took
very
long
the
spoons
being
nearly
as
large
as
the
bowls
they
would
sit
staring
at
the
copper
with
such
eager
eyes
as
if
they
could
have
devoured
the
very
bricks
of
which
it
was
composed
employing
themselves
meanwhile
in
sucking
their
fingers
most
assiduously
with
the
view
of
catching
up
any
stray
splashes
of
gruel
that
might
have
been
cast
thereon
boys
have
generally
excellent
appetites
oliver
twist
and
his
companions
suffered
the
tortures
of
slow
starvation
for
three
months
at
last
they
got
so
voracious
and
wild
with
hunger
that
one
boy
who
was
tall
for
his
age
and
been
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
for
his
father
had
kept
a
small
hinted
darkly
to
his
companions
that
unless
he
had
another
basin
of
gruel
per
diem
he
was
afraid
he
might
some
night
happen
to
eat
the
boy
who
slept
next
him
who
happened
to
be
a
weakly
youth
of
tender
age
he
had
a
wild
hungry
eye
and
they
implicitly
believed
him
a
council
was
held
lots
were
cast
who
should
walk
up
to
the
master
after
supper
that
evening
and
ask
for
more
and
it
fell
to
oliver
twist
the
evening
arrived
the
boys
took
their
places
the
master
in
his
cook
uniform
stationed
himself
at
the
copper
his
pauper
assistants
ranged
themselves
behind
him
the
gruel
was
served
out
and
a
long
grace
was
said
over
the
short
commons
the
gruel
disappeared
the
boys
whispered
each
other
and
winked
at
oliver
while
his
next
neighbors
nudged
him
child
as
he
was
he
was
desperate
with
hunger
and
reckless
with
misery
he
rose
from
the
table
and
advancing
to
the
master
basin
and
spoon
in
hand
said
somewhat
alarmed
at
his
own
temerity
sir
i
want
some
more
the
master
was
a
fat
healthy
man
but
he
turned
very
pale
he
gazed
in
stupefied
astonishment
on
the
small
rebel
for
some
seconds
and
then
clung
for
support
to
the
copper
the
assistants
were
paralysed
with
wonder
the
boys
with
fear
said
the
master
at
length
in
a
faint
voice
sir
replied
oliver
want
some
more
the
master
aimed
a
blow
at
oliver
head
with
the
ladle
pinioned
him
in
his
arm
and
shrieked
aloud
for
the
beadle
the
board
were
sitting
in
solemn
conclave
when
bumble
rushed
into
the
room
in
great
excitement
and
addressing
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
said
limbkins
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
oliver
twist
has
asked
for
more
there
was
a
general
start
horror
was
depicted
on
every
countenance
said
limbkins
yourself
bumble
and
answer
me
distinctly
do
i
understand
that
he
asked
for
more
after
he
had
eaten
the
supper
allotted
by
the
dietary
did
sir
replied
bumble
boy
will
be
hung
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
know
that
boy
will
be
hung
nobody
controverted
the
prophetic
gentleman
opinion
an
animated
discussion
took
place
oliver
was
ordered
into
instant
confinement
and
a
bill
was
next
morning
pasted
on
the
outside
of
the
gate
offering
a
reward
of
five
pounds
to
anybody
who
would
take
oliver
twist
off
the
hands
of
the
parish
in
other
words
five
pounds
and
oliver
twist
were
offered
to
any
man
or
woman
who
wanted
an
apprentice
to
any
trade
business
or
calling
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
as
he
knocked
at
the
gate
and
read
the
bill
next
morning
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
than
i
am
that
that
boy
will
come
to
be
hung
as
i
purpose
to
show
in
the
sequel
whether
the
white
waistcoated
gentleman
was
right
or
not
i
should
perhaps
mar
the
interest
of
this
narrative
supposing
it
to
possess
any
at
all
if
i
ventured
to
hint
just
yet
whether
the
life
of
oliver
twist
had
this
violent
termination
or
no
chapter
iii
relates
how
oliver
twist
was
very
near
getting
a
place
which
would
not
have
been
a
sinecure
for
a
week
after
the
commission
of
the
impious
and
profane
offence
of
asking
for
more
oliver
remained
a
close
prisoner
in
the
dark
and
solitary
room
to
which
he
had
been
consigned
by
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
the
board
it
appears
at
first
sight
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
if
he
had
entertained
a
becoming
feeling
of
respect
for
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
he
would
have
established
that
sage
individual
prophetic
character
once
and
for
ever
by
tying
one
end
of
his
to
a
hook
in
the
wall
and
attaching
himself
to
the
other
to
the
performance
of
this
feat
however
there
was
one
obstacle
namely
that
being
decided
articles
of
luxury
had
been
for
all
future
times
and
ages
removed
from
the
noses
of
paupers
by
the
express
order
of
the
board
in
council
assembled
solemnly
given
and
pronounced
under
their
hands
and
seals
there
was
a
still
greater
obstacle
in
oliver
youth
and
childishness
he
only
cried
bitterly
all
day
and
when
the
long
dismal
night
came
on
spread
his
little
hands
before
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
darkness
and
crouching
in
the
corner
tried
to
sleep
ever
and
anon
waking
with
a
start
and
tremble
and
drawing
himself
closer
and
closer
to
the
wall
as
if
to
feel
even
its
cold
hard
surface
were
a
protection
in
the
gloom
and
loneliness
which
surrounded
him
let
it
not
be
supposed
by
the
enemies
of
system
that
during
the
period
of
his
solitary
incarceration
oliver
was
denied
the
benefit
of
exercise
the
pleasure
of
society
or
the
advantages
of
religious
consolation
as
for
exercise
it
was
nice
cold
weather
and
he
was
allowed
to
perform
his
ablutions
every
morning
under
the
pump
in
a
stone
yard
in
the
presence
of
bumble
who
prevented
his
catching
cold
and
caused
a
tingling
sensation
to
pervade
his
frame
by
repeated
applications
of
the
cane
as
for
society
he
was
carried
every
other
day
into
the
hall
where
the
boys
dined
and
there
sociably
flogged
as
a
public
warning
and
example
and
so
far
from
being
denied
the
advantages
of
religious
consolation
he
was
kicked
into
the
same
apartment
every
evening
at
and
there
permitted
to
listen
to
and
console
his
mind
with
a
general
supplication
of
the
boys
containing
a
special
clause
therein
inserted
by
authority
of
the
board
in
which
they
entreated
to
be
made
good
virtuous
contented
and
obedient
and
to
be
guarded
from
the
sins
and
vices
of
oliver
twist
whom
the
supplication
distinctly
set
forth
to
be
under
the
exclusive
patronage
and
protection
of
the
powers
of
wickedness
and
an
article
direct
from
the
manufactory
of
the
very
devil
himself
it
chanced
one
morning
while
oliver
affairs
were
in
this
auspicious
and
comfortable
state
that
gamfield
went
his
way
down
the
high
street
deeply
cogitating
in
his
mind
his
ways
and
means
of
paying
certain
arrears
of
rent
for
which
his
landlord
had
become
rather
pressing
gamfield
most
sanguine
estimate
of
his
finances
could
not
raise
them
within
full
five
pounds
of
the
desired
amount
and
in
a
species
of
arithmetical
desperation
he
was
alternately
cudgelling
his
brains
and
his
donkey
when
passing
the
workhouse
his
eyes
encountered
the
bill
on
the
gate
o
said
gamfield
to
the
donkey
the
donkey
was
in
a
state
of
profound
abstraction
wondering
probably
whether
he
was
destined
to
be
regaled
with
a
or
two
when
he
had
disposed
of
the
two
sacks
of
soot
with
which
the
little
cart
was
laden
so
without
noticing
the
word
of
command
he
jogged
onward
gamfield
growled
a
fierce
imprecation
on
the
donkey
generally
but
more
particularly
on
his
eyes
and
running
after
him
bestowed
a
blow
on
his
head
which
would
inevitably
have
beaten
in
any
skull
but
a
donkey
then
catching
hold
of
the
bridle
he
gave
his
jaw
a
sharp
wrench
by
way
of
gentle
reminder
that
he
was
not
his
own
master
and
by
these
means
turned
him
round
he
then
gave
him
another
blow
on
the
head
just
to
stun
him
till
he
came
back
again
having
completed
these
arrangements
he
walked
up
to
the
gate
to
read
the
bill
the
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
was
standing
at
the
gate
with
his
hands
behind
him
after
having
delivered
himself
of
some
profound
sentiments
in
the
having
witnessed
the
little
dispute
between
gamfield
and
the
donkey
he
smiled
joyously
when
that
person
came
up
to
read
the
bill
for
he
saw
at
once
that
gamfield
was
exactly
the
sort
of
master
oliver
twist
wanted
gamfield
smiled
too
as
he
perused
the
document
for
five
pounds
was
just
the
sum
he
had
been
wishing
for
and
as
to
the
boy
with
which
it
was
encumbered
gamfield
knowing
what
the
dietary
of
the
workhouse
was
well
knew
he
would
be
a
nice
small
pattern
just
the
very
thing
for
register
stoves
so
he
spelt
the
bill
through
again
from
beginning
to
end
and
then
touching
his
fur
cap
in
token
of
humility
accosted
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
here
boy
sir
wot
the
parish
wants
to
said
gamfield
my
man
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
with
a
condescending
smile
of
him
the
parish
vould
like
him
to
learn
a
right
pleasant
trade
in
a
good
bisness
said
gamfield
wants
a
and
i
am
ready
to
take
him
in
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
gamfield
having
lingered
behind
to
give
the
donkey
another
blow
on
the
head
and
another
wrench
of
the
jaw
as
a
caution
not
to
run
away
in
his
absence
followed
the
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
into
the
room
where
oliver
had
first
seen
him
a
nasty
trade
said
limbkins
when
gamfield
had
again
stated
his
wish
boys
have
been
smothered
in
chimneys
before
now
said
another
gentleman
acause
they
damped
the
straw
afore
they
lit
it
in
the
chimbley
to
make
come
down
again
said
gamfield
all
smoke
and
no
blaze
vereas
smoke
ai
o
no
use
at
all
in
making
a
boy
come
down
for
it
only
sinds
him
to
sleep
and
that
wot
he
likes
boys
is
wery
obstinit
and
wery
lazy
and
there
nothink
like
a
good
hot
blaze
to
make
come
down
vith
a
run
it
humane
too
acause
even
if
they
stuck
in
the
chimbley
roasting
their
feet
makes
struggle
to
hextricate
theirselves
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
appeared
very
much
amused
by
this
explanation
but
his
mirth
was
speedily
checked
by
a
look
from
limbkins
the
board
then
proceeded
to
converse
among
themselves
for
a
few
minutes
but
in
so
low
a
tone
that
the
words
of
expenditure
well
in
the
accounts
a
printed
report
published
were
alone
audible
these
only
chanced
to
be
heard
indeed
or
account
of
their
being
very
frequently
repeated
with
great
emphasis
at
length
the
whispering
ceased
and
the
members
of
the
board
having
resumed
their
seats
and
their
solemnity
limbkins
said
have
considered
your
proposition
and
we
do
approve
of
it
at
all
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
not
added
the
other
members
as
gamfield
did
happen
to
labour
under
the
slight
imputation
of
having
bruised
three
or
four
boys
to
death
already
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
board
had
perhaps
in
some
unaccountable
freak
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
this
extraneous
circumstance
ought
to
influence
their
proceedings
it
was
very
unlike
their
general
mode
of
doing
business
if
they
had
but
still
as
he
had
no
particular
wish
to
revive
the
rumour
he
twisted
his
cap
in
his
hands
and
walked
slowly
from
the
table
you
wo
let
me
have
him
said
gamfield
pausing
near
the
door
replied
limbkins
least
as
it
a
nasty
business
we
think
you
ought
to
take
something
less
than
the
premium
we
offered
gamfield
countenance
brightened
as
with
a
quick
step
he
returned
to
the
table
and
said
you
give
come
do
be
too
hard
on
a
poor
man
what
you
give
should
say
three
pound
ten
was
plenty
said
limbkins
shillings
too
much
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
said
gamfield
four
pound
say
four
pound
and
you
got
rid
of
him
for
good
and
all
there
pound
ten
repeated
limbkins
firmly
i
split
the
urged
gamfield
pound
fifteen
a
farthing
more
was
the
firm
reply
of
limbkins
desperate
hard
upon
me
said
gamfield
wavering
pooh
nonsense
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
be
cheap
with
nothing
at
all
as
a
premium
take
him
you
silly
fellow
he
just
the
boy
for
you
he
wants
the
stick
now
and
then
it
do
him
good
and
his
board
need
come
very
expensive
for
he
has
been
overfed
since
he
was
born
ha
ha
ha
gamfield
gave
an
arch
look
at
the
faces
round
the
table
and
observing
a
smile
on
all
of
them
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
himself
the
bargain
was
made
bumble
was
at
once
instructed
that
oliver
twist
and
his
indentures
were
to
be
conveyed
before
the
magistrate
for
signature
and
approval
that
very
afternoon
in
pursuance
of
this
determination
little
oliver
to
his
excessive
astonishment
was
released
from
bondage
and
ordered
to
put
himself
into
a
clean
shirt
he
had
hardly
achieved
this
very
unusual
gymnastic
performance
when
bumble
brought
him
with
his
own
hands
a
basin
of
gruel
and
the
holiday
allowance
of
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
at
this
tremendous
sight
oliver
began
to
cry
very
piteously
thinking
not
unnaturally
that
the
board
must
have
determined
to
kill
him
for
some
useful
purpose
or
they
never
would
have
begun
to
fatten
him
up
in
that
way
make
your
eyes
red
oliver
but
eat
your
food
and
be
thankful
said
bumble
in
a
tone
of
impressive
pomposity
a
going
to
be
made
a
of
oliver
prentice
sir
said
the
child
trembling
oliver
said
bumble
kind
and
blessed
gentleman
which
is
so
many
parents
to
you
oliver
when
you
have
none
of
your
own
are
a
going
to
you
and
to
set
you
up
in
life
and
make
a
man
of
you
although
the
expense
to
the
parish
is
three
pound
ten
three
pound
ten
oliver
seventy
shillins
one
hundred
and
forty
sixpences
and
all
for
a
naughty
orphan
which
nobody
ca
love
as
bumble
paused
to
take
breath
after
delivering
this
address
in
an
awful
voice
the
tears
rolled
down
the
poor
child
face
and
he
sobbed
bitterly
said
bumble
somewhat
less
pompously
for
it
was
gratifying
to
his
feelings
to
observe
the
effect
his
eloquence
had
produced
oliver
wipe
your
eyes
with
the
cuffs
of
your
jacket
and
cry
into
your
gruel
that
a
very
foolish
action
oliver
it
certainly
was
for
there
was
quite
enough
water
in
it
already
on
their
way
to
the
magistrate
bumble
instructed
oliver
that
all
he
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
look
very
happy
and
say
when
the
gentleman
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
be
apprenticed
that
he
should
like
it
very
much
indeed
both
of
which
injunctions
oliver
promised
to
obey
the
rather
as
bumble
threw
in
a
gentle
hint
that
if
he
failed
in
either
particular
there
was
no
telling
what
would
be
done
to
him
when
they
arrived
at
the
office
he
was
shut
up
in
a
little
room
by
himself
and
admonished
by
bumble
to
stay
there
until
he
came
back
to
fetch
him
there
the
boy
remained
with
a
palpitating
heart
for
half
an
hour
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
bumble
thrust
in
his
head
unadorned
with
the
cocked
hat
and
said
aloud
oliver
my
dear
come
to
the
gentleman
as
bumble
said
this
he
put
on
a
grim
and
threatening
look
and
added
in
a
low
voice
what
i
told
you
you
young
rascal
oliver
stared
innocently
in
bumble
face
at
this
somewhat
contradictory
style
of
address
but
that
gentleman
prevented
his
offering
any
remark
thereupon
by
leading
him
at
once
into
an
adjoining
room
the
door
of
which
was
open
it
was
a
large
room
with
a
great
window
behind
a
desk
sat
two
old
gentleman
with
powdered
heads
one
of
whom
was
reading
the
newspaper
while
the
other
was
perusing
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
spectacles
a
small
piece
of
parchment
which
lay
before
him
limbkins
was
standing
in
front
of
the
desk
on
one
side
and
gamfield
with
a
partially
washed
face
on
the
other
while
two
or
three
men
in
were
lounging
about
the
old
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
gradually
dozed
off
over
the
little
bit
of
parchment
and
there
was
a
short
pause
after
oliver
had
been
stationed
by
bumble
in
front
of
the
desk
is
the
boy
your
worship
said
bumble
the
old
gentleman
who
was
reading
the
newspaper
raised
his
head
for
a
moment
and
pulled
the
other
old
gentleman
by
the
sleeve
whereupon
the
old
gentleman
woke
up
is
this
the
boy
said
the
old
gentleman
is
him
sir
replied
bumble
to
the
magistrate
my
dear
oliver
roused
himself
and
made
his
best
obeisance
he
had
been
wondering
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
magistrates
powder
whether
all
boards
were
born
with
that
white
stuff
on
their
heads
and
were
boards
from
thenceforth
on
that
account
said
the
old
gentleman
suppose
he
fond
of
doats
on
it
your
worship
replied
bumble
giving
oliver
a
sly
pinch
to
intimate
that
he
had
better
not
say
he
did
he
be
a
sweep
will
he
inquired
the
old
gentleman
we
was
to
bind
him
to
any
other
trade
he
run
away
simultaneous
your
worship
replied
bumble
this
man
that
to
be
his
master
you
sir
you
treat
him
well
and
feed
him
and
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
will
you
said
the
old
gentleman
i
says
i
will
i
means
i
will
replied
gamfield
doggedly
a
rough
speaker
my
friend
but
you
look
an
honest
man
said
the
old
gentleman
turning
his
spectacles
in
the
direction
of
the
candidate
for
oliver
premium
whose
villainous
countenance
was
a
regular
stamped
receipt
for
cruelty
but
the
magistrate
was
half
blind
and
half
childish
so
he
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
discern
what
other
people
did
hope
i
am
sir
said
gamfield
with
an
ugly
leer
have
no
doubt
you
are
my
friend
replied
the
old
gentleman
fixing
his
spectacles
more
firmly
on
his
nose
and
looking
about
him
for
the
inkstand
it
was
the
critical
moment
of
oliver
fate
if
the
inkstand
had
been
where
the
old
gentleman
thought
it
was
he
would
have
dipped
his
pen
into
it
and
signed
the
indentures
and
oliver
would
have
been
straightway
hurried
off
but
as
it
chanced
to
be
immediately
under
his
nose
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
he
looked
all
over
his
desk
for
it
without
finding
it
and
happening
in
the
course
of
his
search
to
look
straight
before
him
his
gaze
encountered
the
pale
and
terrified
face
of
oliver
twist
who
despite
all
the
admonitory
looks
and
pinches
of
bumble
was
regarding
the
repulsive
countenance
of
his
future
master
with
a
mingled
expression
of
horror
and
fear
too
palpable
to
be
mistaken
even
by
a
magistrate
the
old
gentleman
stopped
laid
down
his
pen
and
looked
from
oliver
to
limbkins
who
attempted
to
take
snuff
with
a
cheerful
and
unconcerned
aspect
boy
said
the
old
gentleman
look
pale
and
alarmed
what
is
the
matter
a
little
away
from
him
beadle
said
the
other
magistrate
laying
aside
the
paper
and
leaning
forward
with
an
expression
of
interest
boy
tell
us
what
the
matter
do
be
afraid
oliver
fell
on
his
knees
and
clasping
his
hands
together
prayed
that
they
would
order
him
back
to
the
dark
room
that
they
would
starve
him
beat
him
kill
him
if
they
pleased
rather
than
send
him
away
with
that
dreadful
man
said
bumble
raising
his
hands
and
eyes
with
most
impressive
solemnity
of
all
the
artful
and
designing
orphans
that
ever
i
see
oliver
you
are
one
of
the
most
your
tongue
beadle
said
the
second
old
gentleman
when
bumble
had
given
vent
to
this
compound
adjective
beg
your
worship
pardon
said
bumble
incredulous
of
having
heard
aright
your
worship
speak
to
me
hold
your
tongue
bumble
was
stupefied
with
astonishment
a
beadle
ordered
to
hold
his
tongue
a
moral
revolution
the
old
gentleman
in
the
spectacles
looked
at
his
companion
he
nodded
significantly
refuse
to
sanction
these
indentures
said
the
old
gentleman
tossing
aside
the
piece
of
parchment
as
he
spoke
hope
stammered
limbkins
hope
the
magistrates
will
not
form
the
opinion
that
the
authorities
have
been
guilty
of
any
improper
conduct
on
the
unsupported
testimony
of
a
child
magistrates
are
not
called
upon
to
pronounce
any
opinion
on
the
matter
said
the
second
old
gentleman
sharply
the
boy
back
to
the
workhouse
and
treat
him
kindly
he
seems
to
want
it
that
same
evening
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
most
positively
and
decidedly
affirmed
not
only
that
oliver
would
be
hung
but
that
he
would
be
drawn
and
quartered
into
the
bargain
bumble
shook
his
head
with
gloomy
mystery
and
said
he
wished
he
might
come
to
good
whereunto
gamfield
replied
that
he
wished
he
might
come
to
him
which
although
he
agreed
with
the
beadle
in
most
matters
would
seem
to
be
a
wish
of
a
totally
opposite
description
the
next
morning
the
public
were
once
informed
that
oliver
twist
was
again
to
let
and
that
five
pounds
would
be
paid
to
anybody
who
would
take
possession
of
him
chapter
iv
oliver
being
offered
another
place
makes
his
first
entry
into
public
life
in
great
families
when
an
advantageous
place
can
not
be
obtained
either
in
possession
reversion
remainder
or
expectancy
for
the
young
man
who
is
growing
up
it
is
a
very
general
custom
to
send
him
to
sea
the
board
in
imitation
of
so
wise
and
salutary
an
example
took
counsel
together
on
the
expediency
of
shipping
off
oliver
twist
in
some
small
trading
vessel
bound
to
a
good
unhealthy
port
this
suggested
itself
as
the
very
best
thing
that
could
possibly
be
done
with
him
the
probability
being
that
the
skipper
would
flog
him
to
death
in
a
playful
mood
some
day
after
dinner
or
would
knock
his
brains
out
with
an
iron
bar
both
pastimes
being
as
is
pretty
generally
known
very
favourite
and
common
recreations
among
gentleman
of
that
class
the
more
the
case
presented
itself
to
the
board
in
this
point
of
view
the
more
manifold
the
advantages
of
the
step
appeared
so
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
of
providing
for
oliver
effectually
was
to
send
him
to
sea
without
delay
bumble
had
been
despatched
to
make
various
preliminary
inquiries
with
the
view
of
finding
out
some
captain
or
other
who
wanted
a
without
any
friends
and
was
returning
to
the
workhouse
to
communicate
the
result
of
his
mission
when
he
encountered
at
the
gate
no
less
a
person
than
sowerberry
the
parochial
undertaker
sowerberry
was
a
tall
gaunt
man
attired
in
a
suit
of
threadbare
black
with
darned
cotton
stockings
of
the
same
colour
and
shoes
to
answer
his
features
were
not
naturally
intended
to
wear
a
smiling
aspect
but
he
was
in
general
rather
given
to
professional
jocosity
his
step
was
elastic
and
his
face
betokened
inward
pleasantry
as
he
advanced
to
bumble
and
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
have
taken
the
measure
of
the
two
women
that
died
last
night
bumble
said
the
undertaker
make
your
fortune
sowerberry
said
the
beadle
as
he
thrust
his
thumb
and
forefinger
into
the
proffered
of
the
undertaker
which
was
an
ingenious
little
model
of
a
patent
coffin
say
you
make
your
fortune
sowerberry
repeated
bumble
tapping
the
undertaker
on
the
shoulder
in
a
friendly
manner
with
his
cane
so
said
the
undertaker
in
a
tone
which
half
admitted
and
half
disputed
the
probability
of
the
event
prices
allowed
by
the
board
are
very
small
mr
bumble
are
the
coffins
replied
the
beadle
with
precisely
as
near
an
approach
to
a
laugh
as
a
great
official
ought
to
indulge
in
sowerberry
was
much
tickled
at
this
as
of
course
he
ought
to
be
and
laughed
a
long
time
without
cessation
well
bumble
he
said
at
length
no
denying
that
since
the
new
system
of
feeding
has
come
in
the
coffins
are
something
narrower
and
more
shallow
than
they
used
to
be
but
we
must
have
some
profit
bumble
timber
is
an
expensive
article
sir
and
all
the
iron
handles
come
by
canal
from
birmingham
well
said
bumble
trade
has
its
drawbacks
a
fair
profit
is
of
course
allowable
course
of
course
replied
the
undertaker
if
i
do
get
a
profit
upon
this
or
that
particular
article
why
i
make
it
up
in
the
you
see
he
he
he
so
said
bumble
i
must
say
continued
the
undertaker
resuming
the
current
of
observations
which
the
beadle
had
interrupted
i
must
say
bumble
that
i
have
to
contend
against
one
very
great
disadvantage
which
is
that
all
the
stout
people
go
off
the
quickest
the
people
who
have
been
better
off
and
have
paid
rates
for
many
years
are
the
first
to
sink
when
they
come
into
the
house
and
let
me
tell
you
bumble
that
three
or
four
inches
over
one
calculation
makes
a
great
hole
in
one
profits
especially
when
one
has
a
family
to
provide
for
sir
as
sowerberry
said
this
with
the
becoming
indignation
of
an
man
and
as
bumble
felt
that
it
rather
tended
to
convey
a
reflection
on
the
honour
of
the
parish
the
latter
gentleman
thought
it
advisable
to
change
the
subject
oliver
twist
being
uppermost
in
his
mind
he
made
him
his
theme
the
bye
said
bumble
do
know
anybody
who
wants
a
boy
do
you
a
porochial
who
is
at
present
a
a
millstone
as
i
may
say
round
the
porochial
throat
liberal
terms
sowerberry
liberal
terms
as
bumble
spoke
he
raised
his
cane
to
the
bill
above
him
and
gave
three
distinct
raps
upon
the
words
pounds
which
were
printed
thereon
in
roman
capitals
of
gigantic
size
said
the
undertaker
taking
bumble
by
the
lappel
of
his
official
coat
just
the
very
thing
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
you
know
dear
me
what
a
very
elegant
button
this
is
bumble
i
never
noticed
it
before
i
think
it
rather
pretty
said
the
beadle
glancing
proudly
downwards
at
the
large
brass
buttons
which
embellished
his
coat
die
is
the
same
as
the
porochial
seal
the
good
samaritan
healing
the
sick
and
bruised
man
the
board
presented
it
to
me
on
morning
sowerberry
i
put
it
on
i
remember
for
the
first
time
to
attend
the
inquest
on
that
reduced
tradesman
who
died
in
a
doorway
at
midnight
recollect
said
the
undertaker
jury
brought
it
in
died
from
exposure
to
the
cold
and
want
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
did
they
bumble
nodded
they
made
it
a
special
verdict
i
think
said
the
undertaker
adding
some
words
to
the
effect
that
if
the
relieving
officer
had
foolery
interposed
the
beadle
the
board
attended
to
all
the
nonsense
that
ignorant
jurymen
talk
they
have
enough
to
do
true
said
the
undertaker
would
indeed
said
bumble
grasping
his
cane
tightly
as
was
his
wont
when
working
into
a
passion
is
ineddicated
vulgar
grovelling
wretches
they
are
said
the
undertaker
have
no
more
philosophy
nor
political
economy
about
than
that
said
the
beadle
snapping
his
fingers
contemptuously
more
they
have
acquiesced
the
undertaker
despise
said
the
beadle
growing
very
red
in
the
face
do
i
rejoined
the
undertaker
i
only
wish
we
a
jury
of
the
independent
sort
in
the
house
for
a
week
or
two
said
the
beadle
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
would
soon
bring
their
spirit
down
for
alone
for
that
replied
the
undertaker
so
saying
he
smiled
approvingly
to
calm
the
rising
wrath
of
the
indignant
parish
officer
mr
bumble
lifted
off
his
cocked
hat
took
a
handkerchief
from
the
inside
of
the
crown
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
rage
had
engendered
fixed
the
cocked
hat
on
again
and
turning
to
the
undertaker
said
in
a
calmer
voice
what
about
the
boy
replied
the
undertaker
you
know
bumble
i
pay
a
good
deal
towards
the
poor
rates
said
bumble
replied
the
undertaker
was
thinking
that
if
i
pay
so
much
towards
i
a
right
to
get
as
much
out
of
as
i
can
bumble
and
so
i
think
i
take
the
boy
myself
bumble
grasped
the
undertaker
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
the
building
sowerberry
was
closeted
with
the
board
for
five
minutes
and
it
was
arranged
that
oliver
should
go
to
him
that
evening
liking
a
phrase
which
means
in
the
case
of
a
parish
apprentice
that
if
the
master
find
upon
a
short
trial
that
he
can
get
enough
work
out
of
a
boy
without
putting
too
much
food
into
him
he
shall
have
him
for
a
term
of
years
to
do
what
he
likes
with
when
little
oliver
was
taken
before
gentlemen
that
evening
and
informed
that
he
was
to
go
that
night
as
general
to
a
and
that
if
he
complained
of
his
situation
or
ever
came
back
to
the
parish
again
he
would
be
sent
to
sea
there
to
be
drowned
or
knocked
on
the
head
as
the
case
might
be
he
evinced
so
little
emotion
that
they
by
common
consent
pronounced
him
a
hardened
young
rascal
and
ordered
bumble
to
remove
him
forthwith
now
although
it
was
very
natural
that
the
board
of
all
people
in
the
world
should
feel
in
a
great
state
of
virtuous
astonishment
and
horror
at
the
smallest
tokens
of
want
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
anybody
they
were
rather
out
in
this
particular
instance
the
simple
fact
was
that
oliver
instead
of
possessing
too
little
feeling
possessed
rather
too
much
and
was
in
a
fair
way
of
being
reduced
for
life
to
a
state
of
brutal
stupidity
and
sullenness
by
the
ill
usage
he
had
received
he
heard
the
news
of
his
destination
in
perfect
silence
and
having
had
his
luggage
put
into
his
hand
which
was
not
very
difficult
to
carry
inasmuch
as
it
was
all
comprised
within
the
limits
of
a
brown
paper
parcel
about
half
a
foot
square
by
three
inches
deep
he
pulled
his
cap
over
his
eyes
and
once
more
attaching
himself
to
coat
cuff
was
led
away
by
that
dignitary
to
a
new
scene
of
suffering
for
some
time
bumble
drew
oliver
along
without
notice
or
remark
for
the
beadle
carried
his
head
very
erect
as
a
beadle
always
should
and
it
being
a
windy
day
little
oliver
was
completely
enshrouded
by
the
skirts
of
bumble
coat
as
they
blew
open
and
disclosed
to
great
advantage
his
flapped
waistcoat
and
drab
plush
as
they
drew
near
to
their
destination
however
bumble
thought
it
expedient
to
look
down
and
see
that
the
boy
was
in
good
order
for
inspection
by
his
new
master
which
he
accordingly
did
with
a
fit
and
becoming
air
of
gracious
patronage
said
bumble
sir
replied
oliver
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
that
cap
off
your
eyes
and
hold
up
your
head
sir
although
oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
at
once
and
passed
the
back
of
his
unoccupied
hand
briskly
across
his
eyes
he
left
a
tear
in
them
when
he
looked
up
at
his
conductor
as
bumble
gazed
sternly
upon
him
it
rolled
down
his
cheek
it
was
followed
by
another
and
another
the
child
made
a
strong
effort
but
it
was
an
unsuccessful
one
withdrawing
his
other
hand
from
bumble
he
covered
his
face
with
both
and
wept
until
the
tears
sprung
out
from
between
his
chin
and
bony
fingers
exclaimed
bumble
stopping
short
and
darting
at
his
little
charge
a
look
of
intense
malignity
of
the
ungratefullest
and
boys
as
ever
i
see
oliver
you
are
the
no
sir
sobbed
oliver
clinging
to
the
hand
which
held
the
cane
no
sir
i
will
be
good
indeed
indeed
indeed
i
will
sir
i
am
a
very
little
boy
sir
and
it
is
so
so
what
inquired
bumble
in
amazement
lonely
sir
so
very
lonely
cried
the
child
hates
me
oh
sir
do
do
pray
be
cross
to
me
the
child
beat
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
looked
in
his
companion
face
with
tears
of
real
agony
bumble
regarded
oliver
piteous
and
helpless
look
with
some
astonishment
for
a
few
seconds
hemmed
three
or
four
times
in
a
husky
manner
and
after
muttering
something
about
troublesome
cough
bade
oliver
dry
his
eyes
and
be
a
good
boy
then
once
more
taking
his
hand
he
walked
on
with
him
in
silence
the
undertaker
who
had
just
put
up
the
shutters
of
his
shop
was
making
some
entries
in
his
by
the
light
of
a
most
appropriate
dismal
candle
when
bumble
entered
said
the
undertaker
looking
up
from
the
book
and
pausing
in
the
middle
of
a
word
that
you
bumble
one
else
sowerberry
replied
the
beadle
i
brought
the
boy
oliver
made
a
bow
that
the
boy
is
it
said
the
undertaker
raising
the
candle
above
his
head
to
get
a
better
view
of
oliver
sowerberry
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
come
here
a
moment
my
dear
sowerberry
emerged
from
a
little
room
behind
the
shop
and
presented
the
form
of
a
short
then
woman
with
a
vixenish
countenance
dear
said
sowerberry
deferentially
is
the
boy
from
the
workhouse
that
i
told
you
of
oliver
bowed
again
me
said
the
undertaker
wife
very
small
he
rather
small
replied
bumble
looking
at
oliver
as
if
it
were
his
fault
that
he
was
no
bigger
is
small
there
no
denying
it
but
he
grow
sowerberry

dare
say

will
replied
the
lady
pettishly
our
victuals
and
our
drink
i
see
no
saving
in
parish
children
not
i
for
they
always
cost
more
to
keep
than
they
worth
however
men
always
think
they
know
best
there
get
downstairs
little
bag
o
bones
with
this
the
undertaker
wife
opened
a
side
door
and
pushed
oliver
down
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
into
a
stone
cell
damp
and
dark
forming
the
to
the
and
denominated
wherein
sat
a
slatternly
girl
in
shoes
down
at
heel
and
blue
worsted
stockings
very
much
out
of
repair
charlotte
said
sowerberry
who
had
followed
oliver
down
this
boy
some
of
the
cold
bits
that
were
put
by
for
trip
he
has
come
home
since
the
morning
so
he
may
go
without
i
dare
say
the
boy
is
too
dainty
to
eat
are
you
boy
oliver
whose
eyes
had
glistened
at
the
mention
of
meat
and
who
was
trembling
with
eagerness
to
devour
it
replied
in
the
negative
and
a
plateful
of
coarse
broken
victuals
was
set
before
him
i
wish
some
philosopher
whose
meat
and
drink
turn
to
gall
within
him
whose
blood
is
ice
whose
heart
is
iron
could
have
seen
oliver
twist
clutching
at
the
dainty
viands
that
the
dog
had
neglected
i
wish
he
could
have
witnessed
the
horrible
avidity
with
which
oliver
tore
the
bits
asunder
with
all
the
ferocity
of
famine
there
is
only
one
thing
i
should
like
better
and
that
would
be
to
see
the
philosopher
making
the
same
sort
of
meal
himself
with
the
same
relish
said
the
undertaker
wife
when
oliver
had
finished
his
supper
which
she
had
regarded
in
silent
horror
and
with
fearful
auguries
of
his
future
appetite
you
done
there
being
nothing
eatable
within
his
reach
oliver
replied
in
the
affirmative
come
with
me
said
sowerberry
taking
up
a
dim
and
dirty
lamp
and
leading
the
way
upstairs
bed
under
the
counter
you
do
mind
sleeping
among
the
coffins
i
suppose
but
it
does
much
matter
whether
you
do
or
do
for
you
ca
sleep
anywhere
else
come
do
keep
me
here
all
night
oliver
lingered
no
longer
but
meekly
followed
his
new
mistress
chapter
v
oliver
mingles
with
new
associates
going
to
a
funeral
for
the
first
time
he
forms
an
unfavourable
notion
of
his
master
business
oliver
being
left
to
himself
in
the
undertaker
shop
set
the
lamp
down
on
a
workman
bench
and
gazed
timidly
about
him
with
a
feeling
of
awe
and
dread
which
many
people
a
good
deal
older
than
he
will
be
at
no
loss
to
understand
an
unfinished
coffin
on
black
tressels
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
looked
so
gloomy
and
that
a
cold
tremble
came
over
him
every
time
his
eyes
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
dismal
object
from
which
he
almost
expected
to
see
some
frightful
form
slowly
rear
its
head
to
drive
him
mad
with
terror
against
the
wall
were
ranged
in
regular
array
a
long
row
of
elm
boards
cut
in
the
same
shape
looking
in
the
dim
light
like
ghosts
with
their
hands
in
their
breeches
pockets
nails
and
shreds
of
black
cloth
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
and
the
wall
behind
the
counter
was
ornamented
with
a
lively
representation
of
two
mutes
in
very
stiff
neckcloths
on
duty
at
a
large
private
door
with
a
hearse
drawn
by
four
black
steeds
approaching
in
the
distance
the
shop
was
close
and
hot
the
atmosphere
seemed
tainted
with
the
smell
of
coffins
the
recess
beneath
the
counter
in
which
his
flock
mattress
was
thrust
looked
like
a
grave
nor
were
these
the
only
dismal
feelings
which
depressed
oliver
he
was
alone
in
a
strange
place
and
we
all
know
how
chilled
and
desolate
the
best
of
us
will
sometimes
feel
in
such
a
situation
the
boy
had
no
friends
to
care
for
or
to
care
for
him
the
regret
of
no
recent
separation
was
fresh
in
his
mind
the
absence
of
no
loved
and
face
sank
heavily
into
his
heart
but
his
heart
was
heavy
notwithstanding
and
he
wished
as
he
crept
into
his
narrow
bed
that
that
were
his
coffin
and
that
he
could
be
lain
in
a
calm
and
lasting
sleep
in
the
churchyard
ground
with
the
tall
grass
waving
gently
above
his
head
and
the
sound
of
the
old
deep
bell
to
soothe
him
in
his
sleep
oliver
was
awakened
in
the
morning
by
a
loud
kicking
at
the
outside
of
the
which
before
he
could
huddle
on
his
clothes
was
repeated
in
an
angry
and
impetuous
manner
about
times
when
he
began
to
undo
the
chain
the
legs
desisted
and
a
voice
began
the
door
will
yer
cried
the
voice
which
belonged
to
the
legs
which
had
kicked
at
the
door
will
directly
sir
replied
oliver
undoing
the
chain
and
turning
the
key
suppose
yer
the
new
boy
ai
yer
said
the
voice
through
the
sir
replied
oliver
old
are
yer
inquired
the
voice
sir
replied
oliver
i
whop
yer
when
i
get
in
said
the
voice
just
see
if
i
do
that
all
my
brat
and
having
made
this
obliging
promise
the
voice
began
to
whistle
oliver
had
been
too
often
subjected
to
the
process
to
which
the
very
expressive
monosyllable
just
recorded
bears
reference
to
entertain
the
smallest
doubt
that
the
owner
of
the
voice
whoever
he
might
be
would
redeem
his
pledge
most
honourably
he
drew
back
the
bolts
with
a
trembling
hand
and
opened
the
door
for
a
second
or
two
oliver
glanced
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
and
over
the
way
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
unknown
who
had
addressed
him
through
the
had
walked
a
few
paces
off
to
warm
himself
for
nobody
did
he
see
but
a
big
sitting
on
a
post
in
front
of
the
house
eating
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
which
he
cut
into
wedges
the
size
of
his
mouth
with
a
and
then
consumed
with
great
dexterity
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
oliver
at
length
seeing
that
no
other
visitor
made
his
appearance
you
knock
kicked
replied
the
you
want
a
coffin
sir
inquired
oliver
innocently
at
this
the
looked
monstrous
fierce
and
said
that
oliver
would
want
one
before
long
if
he
cut
jokes
with
his
superiors
in
that
way
do
know
who
i
am
i
suppose
said
the
in
continuation
descending
from
the
top
of
the
post
meanwhile
with
edifying
gravity
sir
rejoined
oliver
mister
noah
claypole
said
the
you
under
me
take
down
the
shutters
yer
idle
young
ruffian
with
this
claypole
administered
a
kick
to
oliver
and
entered
the
shop
with
a
dignified
air
which
did
him
great
credit
it
is
difficult
for
a
youth
of
lumbering
make
and
heavy
countenance
to
look
dignified
under
any
circumstances
but
it
is
more
especially
so
when
superadded
to
these
personal
attractions
are
a
red
nose
and
yellow
smalls
oliver
having
taken
down
the
shutters
and
broken
a
pane
of
glass
in
his
effort
to
stagger
away
beneath
the
weight
of
the
first
one
to
a
small
court
at
the
side
of
the
house
in
which
they
were
kept
during
the
day
was
graciously
assisted
by
noah
who
having
consoled
him
with
the
assurance
that
catch
it
condescended
to
help
him
sowerberry
came
down
soon
after
shortly
afterwards
sowerberry
appeared
oliver
having
it
in
fulfilment
of
prediction
followed
that
young
gentleman
down
the
stairs
to
breakfast
near
the
fire
noah
said
charlotte
saved
a
nice
little
bit
of
bacon
for
you
from
master
breakfast
oliver
shut
that
door
at
mister
noah
back
and
take
them
bits
that
i
put
out
on
the
cover
of
the
there
your
tea
take
it
away
to
that
box
and
drink
it
there
and
make
haste
for
they
want
you
to
mind
the
shop
d
hear
d
hear
said
noah
claypole
noah
said
charlotte
a
rum
creature
you
are
why
you
let
the
boy
alone
him
alone
said
noah
everybody
lets
him
alone
enough
for
the
matter
of
that
neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
will
ever
interfere
with
him
all
his
relations
let
him
have
his
own
way
pretty
well
eh
charlotte
he
he
he
you
queer
soul
said
charlotte
bursting
into
a
hearty
laugh
in
which
she
was
joined
by
noah
after
which
they
both
looked
scornfully
at
poor
oliver
twist
as
he
sat
shivering
on
the
box
in
the
coldest
corner
of
the
room
and
ate
the
stale
pieces
which
had
been
specially
reserved
for
him
noah
was
a
but
not
a
workhouse
orphan
no
was
he
for
he
could
trace
his
genealogy
all
the
way
back
to
his
parents
who
lived
hard
by
his
mother
being
a
washerwoman
and
his
father
a
drunken
soldier
discharged
with
a
wooden
leg
and
a
diurnal
pension
of
and
an
unstateable
fraction
the
in
the
neighbourhood
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
branding
noah
in
the
public
streets
with
the
ignominious
epithets
of
and
the
like
and
noah
had
bourne
them
without
reply
but
now
that
fortune
had
cast
in
his
way
a
nameless
orphan
at
whom
even
the
meanest
could
point
the
finger
of
scorn
he
retorted
on
him
with
interest
this
affords
charming
food
for
contemplation
it
shows
us
what
a
beautiful
thing
human
nature
may
be
made
to
be
and
how
impartially
the
same
amiable
qualities
are
developed
in
the
finest
lord
and
the
dirtiest
oliver
had
been
sojourning
at
the
undertaker
some
three
weeks
or
a
month
and
sowerberry
the
shop
being
shut
up
were
taking
their
supper
in
the
little
when
sowerberry
after
several
deferential
glances
at
his
wife
said
dear
he
was
going
to
say
more
but
sowerberry
looking
up
with
a
peculiarly
unpropitious
aspect
he
stopped
short
said
sowerberry
sharply
my
dear
nothing
said
sowerberry
you
brute
said
sowerberry
at
all
my
dear
said
sowerberry
humbly
thought
you
did
want
to
hear
my
dear
i
was
only
going
to
say
do
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
say
interposed
sowerberry
am
nobody
do
consult
me
pray
do
want
to
intrude
upon
your
secrets
as
sowerberry
said
this
she
gave
an
hysterical
laugh
which
threatened
violent
consequences
my
dear
said
sowerberry
want
to
ask
your
advice
no
do
ask
mine
replied
sowerberry
in
an
affecting
manner
somebody
else
here
there
was
another
hysterical
laugh
which
frightened
sowerberry
very
much
this
is
a
very
common
and
matrimonial
course
of
treatment
which
is
often
very
effective
it
at
once
reduced
sowerberry
to
begging
as
a
special
favour
to
be
allowed
to
say
what
sowerberry
was
most
curious
to
hear
after
a
short
duration
the
permission
was
most
graciously
conceded
only
about
young
twist
my
dear
said
sowerberry
very
boy
that
my
dear
need
be
for
he
eats
enough
observed
the
lady
an
expression
of
melancholy
in
his
face
my
dear
resumed
sowerberry
is
very
interesting
he
would
make
a
delightful
mute
my
love
sowerberry
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
considerable
wonderment
sowerberry
remarked
it
and
without
allowing
time
for
any
observation
on
the
good
lady
part
proceeded
do
mean
a
regular
mute
to
attend
people
my
dear
but
only
for
children
practice
it
would
be
very
new
to
have
a
mute
in
proportion
my
dear
you
may
depend
upon
it
it
would
have
a
superb
effect
sowerberry
who
had
a
good
deal
of
taste
in
the
undertaking
way
was
much
struck
by
the
novelty
of
this
idea
but
as
it
would
have
been
compromising
her
dignity
to
have
said
so
under
existing
circumstances
she
merely
inquired
with
much
sharpness
why
such
an
obvious
suggestion
had
not
presented
itself
to
her
husband
mind
before
sowerberry
rightly
construed
this
as
an
acquiescence
in
his
proposition
it
was
speedily
determined
therefore
that
oliver
should
be
at
once
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
trade
and
with
this
view
that
he
should
accompany
his
master
on
the
very
next
occasion
of
his
services
being
required
the
occasion
was
not
long
in
coming
half
an
hour
after
breakfast
next
morning
bumble
entered
the
shop
and
supporting
his
cane
against
the
counter
drew
forth
his
large
leathern
from
which
he
selected
a
small
scrap
of
paper
which
he
handed
over
to
sowerberry
said
the
undertaker
glancing
over
it
with
a
lively
countenance
order
for
a
coffin
eh
a
coffin
first
and
a
porochial
funeral
afterwards
replied
bumble
fastening
the
strap
of
the
leathern
which
like
himself
was
very
corpulent
said
the
undertaker
looking
from
the
scrap
of
paper
to
bumble
never
heard
the
name
before
bumble
shook
his
head
as
he
replied
people
sowerberry
very
obstinate
proud
too
i
afraid
sir
eh
exclaimed
sowerberry
with
a
sneer
that
too
much
it
sickening
replied
the
beadle
mr
sowerberry
it
is
acquiesced
the
undertaker
only
heard
of
the
family
the
night
before
last
said
the
beadle
we
should
have
known
anything
about
them
then
only
a
woman
who
lodges
in
the
same
house
made
an
application
to
the
porochial
committee
for
them
to
send
the
porochial
surgeon
to
see
a
woman
as
was
very
bad
he
had
gone
out
to
dinner
but
his
which
is
a
very
clever
lad
sent
some
medicine
in
a
offhand
there
promptness
said
the
undertaker
indeed
replied
the
beadle
what
the
consequence
what
the
ungrateful
behaviour
of
these
rebels
sir
why
the
husband
sends
back
word
that
the
medicine
wo
suit
his
wife
complaint
and
so
she
sha
take
it
says
she
sha
take
it
sir
good
strong
wholesome
medicine
as
was
given
with
great
success
to
two
irish
labourers
and
a
only
a
week
before
sent
for
nothing
with
a
in
and
he
sends
back
word
that
she
sha
take
it
sir
as
the
atrocity
presented
itself
to
bumble
mind
in
full
force
he
struck
the
counter
sharply
with
his
cane
and
became
flushed
with
indignation
said
the
undertaker
ne
ver
did
did
sir
ejaculated
the
beadle
nor
nobody
never
did
but
now
she
dead
we
got
to
bury
her
and
that
the
direction
and
the
sooner
it
done
the
better
thus
saying
bumble
put
on
his
cocked
hat
wrong
side
first
in
a
fever
of
parochial
excitement
and
flounced
out
of
the
shop
he
was
so
angry
oliver
that
he
forgot
even
to
ask
after
you
said
sowerberry
looking
after
the
beadle
as
he
strode
down
the
street
sir
replied
oliver
who
had
carefully
kept
himself
out
of
sight
during
the
interview
and
who
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
at
the
mere
recollection
of
the
sound
of
bumble
voice
he
need
haven
taken
the
trouble
to
shrink
from
bumble
glance
however
for
that
functionary
on
whom
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
had
made
a
very
strong
impression
thought
that
now
the
undertaker
had
got
oliver
upon
trial
the
subject
was
better
avoided
until
such
time
as
he
should
be
firmly
bound
for
seven
years
and
all
danger
of
his
being
returned
upon
the
hands
of
the
parish
should
be
thus
effectually
and
legally
overcome
said
sowerberry
taking
up
his
hat
sooner
this
job
is
done
the
better
noah
look
after
the
shop
oliver
put
on
your
cap
and
come
with
me
oliver
obeyed
and
followed
his
master
on
his
professional
mission
they
walked
on
for
some
time
through
the
most
crowded
and
densely
inhabited
part
of
the
town
and
then
striking
down
a
narrow
street
more
dirty
and
miserable
than
any
they
had
yet
passed
through
paused
to
look
for
the
house
which
was
the
object
of
their
search
the
houses
on
either
side
were
high
and
large
but
very
old
and
tenanted
by
people
of
the
poorest
class
as
their
neglected
appearance
would
have
sufficiently
denoted
without
the
concurrent
testimony
afforded
by
the
squalid
looks
of
the
few
men
and
women
who
with
folded
arms
and
bodies
half
doubled
occasionally
skulked
along
a
great
many
of
the
tenements
had
but
these
were
fast
closed
and
mouldering
away
only
the
upper
rooms
being
inhabited
some
houses
which
had
become
insecure
from
age
and
decay
were
prevented
from
falling
into
the
street
by
huge
beams
of
wood
reared
against
the
walls
and
firmly
planted
in
the
road
but
even
these
crazy
dens
seemed
to
have
been
selected
as
the
nightly
haunts
of
some
houseless
wretches
for
many
of
the
rough
boards
which
supplied
the
place
of
door
and
window
were
wrenched
from
their
positions
to
afford
an
aperture
wide
enough
for
the
passage
of
a
human
body
the
kennel
was
stagnant
and
filthy
the
very
rats
which
here
and
there
lay
putrefying
in
its
rottenness
were
hideous
with
famine
there
was
neither
knocker
nor
at
the
open
door
where
oliver
and
his
master
stopped
so
groping
his
way
cautiously
through
the
dark
passage
and
bidding
oliver
keep
close
to
him
and
not
be
afraid
the
undertaker
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
stumbling
against
a
door
on
the
landing
he
rapped
at
it
with
his
knuckles
it
was
opened
by
a
young
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
the
undertaker
at
once
saw
enough
of
what
the
room
contained
to
know
it
was
the
apartment
to
which
he
had
been
directed
he
stepped
in
oliver
followed
him
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
but
a
man
was
crouching
mechanically
over
the
empty
stove
an
old
woman
too
had
drawn
a
low
stool
to
the
cold
hearth
and
was
sitting
beside
him
there
were
some
ragged
children
in
another
corner
and
in
a
small
recess
opposite
the
door
there
lay
upon
the
ground
something
covered
with
an
old
blanket
oliver
shuddered
as
he
cast
his
eyes
toward
the
place
and
crept
involuntarily
closer
to
his
master
for
though
it
was
covered
up
the
boy
felt
that
it
was
a
corpse
the
man
face
was
thin
and
very
pale
his
hair
and
beard
were
grizzly
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
the
old
woman
face
was
wrinkled
her
two
remaining
teeth
protruded
over
her
under
lip
and
her
eyes
were
bright
and
piercing
oliver
was
afraid
to
look
at
either
her
or
the
man
they
seemed
so
like
the
rats
he
had
seen
outside
shall
go
near
her
said
the
man
starting
fiercely
up
as
the
undertaker
approached
the
recess
back
damn
you
keep
back
if
you
a
life
to
lose
my
good
man
said
the
undertaker
who
was
pretty
well
used
to
misery
in
all
its
shapes
tell
you
said
the
man
clenching
his
hands
and
stamping
furiously
on
the
floor
tell
you
i
wo
have
her
put
into
the
ground
she
could
rest
there
the
worms
would
worry
her
not
eat
her
she
is
so
worn
away
the
undertaker
offered
no
reply
to
this
raving
but
producing
a
tape
from
his
pocket
knelt
down
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
body
said
the
man
bursting
into
tears
and
sinking
on
his
knees
at
the
feet
of
the
dead
woman
down
kneel
down
kneel
round
her
every
one
of
you
and
mark
my
words
i
say
she
was
starved
to
death
i
never
knew
how
bad
she
was
till
the
fever
came
upon
her
and
then
her
bones
were
starting
through
the
skin
there
was
neither
fire
nor
candle
she
died
in
the
dark
in
the
dark
she
could
even
see
her
children
faces
though
we
heard
her
gasping
out
their
names
i
begged
for
her
in
the
streets
and
they
sent
me
to
prison
when
i
came
back
she
was
dying
and
all
the
blood
in
my
heart
has
dried
up
for
they
starved
her
to
death
i
swear
it
before
the
god
that
saw
it
they
starved
her
he
twined
his
hands
in
his
hair
and
with
a
loud
scream
rolled
grovelling
upon
the
floor
his
eyes
fixed
and
the
foam
covering
his
lips
the
terrified
children
cried
bitterly
but
the
old
woman
who
had
hitherto
remained
as
quiet
as
if
she
had
been
wholly
deaf
to
all
that
passed
menaced
them
into
silence
having
unloosened
the
cravat
of
the
man
who
still
remained
extended
on
the
ground
she
tottered
towards
the
undertaker
was
my
daughter
said
the
old
woman
nodding
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
corpse
and
speaking
with
an
idiotic
leer
more
ghastly
than
even
the
presence
of
death
in
such
a
place
lord
well
it
strange
that
i
who
gave
birth
to
her
and
was
a
woman
then
should
be
alive
and
merry
now
and
she
lying
there
so
cold
and
stiff
lord
lord
to
think
of
it
it
as
good
as
a
play
as
good
as
a
play
as
the
wretched
creature
mumbled
and
chuckled
in
her
hideous
merriment
the
undertaker
turned
to
go
away
stop
said
the
old
woman
in
a
loud
whisper
she
be
buried
or
next
day
or
i
laid
her
out
and
i
must
walk
you
know
send
me
a
large
cloak
a
good
warm
one
for
it
is
bitter
cold
we
should
have
cake
and
wine
too
before
we
go
never
mind
send
some
bread
only
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
shall
we
have
some
bread
dear
she
said
eagerly
catching
at
the
undertaker
coat
as
he
once
more
moved
towards
the
door
yes
said
the
undertaker
course
anything
you
like
he
disengaged
himself
from
the
old
woman
grasp
and
drawing
oliver
after
him
hurried
away
the
next
day
the
family
having
been
meanwhile
relieved
with
a
loaf
and
a
piece
of
cheese
left
with
them
by
bumble
himself
oliver
and
his
master
returned
to
the
miserable
abode
where
bumble
had
already
arrived
accompanied
by
four
men
from
the
workhouse
who
were
to
act
as
bearers
an
old
black
cloak
had
been
thrown
over
the
rags
of
the
old
woman
and
the
man
and
the
bare
coffin
having
been
screwed
down
was
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
and
carried
into
the
street
you
must
put
your
best
leg
foremost
old
lady
whispered
sowerberry
in
the
old
woman
ear
are
rather
late
and
it
do
to
keep
the
clergyman
waiting
move
on
my
men
as
quick
as
you
like
thus
directed
the
bearers
trotted
on
under
their
light
burden
and
the
two
mourners
kept
as
near
them
as
they
could
bumble
and
sowerberry
walked
at
a
good
smart
pace
in
front
and
oliver
whose
legs
were
not
so
long
as
his
master
ran
by
the
side
there
was
not
so
great
a
necessity
for
hurrying
as
sowerberry
had
anticipated
however
for
when
they
reached
the
obscure
corner
of
the
churchyard
in
which
the
nettles
grew
and
where
the
parish
graves
were
made
the
clergyman
had
not
arrived
and
the
clerk
who
was
sitting
by
the
fire
seemed
to
think
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
might
be
an
hour
or
so
before
he
came
so
they
put
the
bier
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
and
the
two
mourners
waited
patiently
in
the
damp
clay
with
a
cold
rain
drizzling
down
while
the
ragged
boys
whom
the
spectacle
had
attracted
into
the
churchyard
played
a
noisy
game
at
among
the
tombstones
or
varied
their
amusements
by
jumping
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
coffin
sowerberry
and
bumble
being
personal
friends
of
the
clerk
sat
by
the
fire
with
him
and
read
the
paper
at
length
after
a
lapse
of
something
more
than
an
hour
bumble
and
sowerberry
and
the
clerk
were
seen
running
towards
the
grave
immediately
afterwards
the
clergyman
appeared
putting
on
his
surplice
as
he
came
along
bumble
then
thrashed
a
boy
or
two
to
keep
up
appearances
and
the
reverend
gentleman
having
read
as
much
of
the
burial
service
as
could
be
compressed
into
four
minutes
gave
his
surplice
to
the
clerk
and
walked
away
again
bill
said
sowerberry
to
the
up
it
was
no
very
difficult
task
for
the
grave
was
so
full
that
the
uppermost
coffin
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
surface
the
shovelled
in
the
earth
stamped
it
loosely
down
with
his
feet
shouldered
his
spade
and
walked
off
followed
by
the
boys
who
murmured
very
loud
complaints
at
the
fun
being
over
so
soon
my
good
fellow
said
bumble
tapping
the
man
on
the
back
want
to
shut
up
the
yard
the
man
who
had
never
once
moved
since
he
had
taken
his
station
by
the
grave
side
started
raised
his
head
stared
at
the
person
who
had
addressed
him
walked
forward
for
a
few
paces
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
the
crazy
old
woman
was
too
much
occupied
in
bewailing
the
loss
of
her
cloak
which
the
undertaker
had
taken
off
to
pay
him
any
attention
so
they
threw
a
can
of
cold
water
over
him
and
when
he
came
to
saw
him
safely
out
of
the
churchyard
locked
the
gate
and
departed
on
their
different
ways
oliver
said
sowerberry
as
they
walked
home
do
you
like
it
well
thank
you
sir
replied
oliver
with
considerable
hesitation
very
much
sir
you
get
used
to
it
in
time
oliver
said
sowerberry
when
you
used
to
it
my
boy
oliver
wondered
in
his
own
mind
whether
it
had
taken
a
very
long
time
to
get
sowerberry
used
to
it
but
he
thought
it
better
not
to
ask
the
question
and
walked
back
to
the
shop
thinking
over
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
chapter
vi
oliver
being
goaded
by
the
taunts
of
noah
rouses
into
action
and
rather
astonishes
him
the
month
trial
over
oliver
was
formally
apprenticed
it
was
a
nice
sickly
season
just
at
this
time
in
commercial
phrase
coffins
were
looking
up
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
oliver
acquired
a
great
deal
of
experience
the
success
of
sowerberry
ingenious
speculation
exceeded
even
his
most
sanguine
hopes
the
oldest
inhabitants
recollected
no
period
at
which
measles
had
been
so
prevalent
or
so
fatal
to
infant
existence
and
many
were
the
mournful
processions
which
little
oliver
headed
in
a
reaching
down
to
his
knees
to
the
indescribable
admiration
and
emotion
of
all
the
mothers
in
the
town
as
oliver
accompanied
his
master
in
most
of
his
adult
expeditions
too
in
order
that
he
might
acquire
that
equanimity
of
demeanour
and
full
command
of
nerve
which
was
essential
to
a
finished
undertaker
he
had
many
opportunities
of
observing
the
beautiful
resignation
and
fortitude
with
which
some
people
bear
their
trials
and
losses
for
instance
when
sowerberry
had
an
order
for
the
burial
of
some
rich
old
lady
or
gentleman
who
was
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
nephews
and
nieces
who
had
been
perfectly
inconsolable
during
the
previous
illness
and
whose
grief
had
been
wholly
irrepressible
even
on
the
most
public
occasions
they
would
be
as
happy
among
themselves
as
need
be
quite
cheerful
and
contented
conversing
together
with
as
much
freedom
and
gaiety
as
if
nothing
whatever
had
happened
to
disturb
them
husbands
too
bore
the
loss
of
their
wives
with
the
most
heroic
calmness
wives
again
put
on
weeds
for
their
husbands
as
if
so
far
from
grieving
in
the
garb
of
sorrow
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
render
it
as
becoming
and
attractive
as
possible
it
was
observable
too
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
in
passions
of
anguish
during
the
ceremony
of
interment
recovered
almost
as
soon
as
they
reached
home
and
became
quite
composed
before
the
was
over
all
this
was
very
pleasant
and
improving
to
see
and
oliver
beheld
it
with
great
admiration
that
oliver
twist
was
moved
to
resignation
by
the
example
of
these
good
people
i
can
not
although
i
am
his
biographer
undertake
to
affirm
with
any
degree
of
confidence
but
i
can
most
distinctly
say
that
for
many
months
he
continued
meekly
to
submit
to
the
domination
and
of
noah
claypole
who
used
him
far
worse
than
before
now
that
his
jealousy
was
roused
by
seeing
the
new
boy
promoted
to
the
black
stick
and
hatband
while
he
the
old
one
remained
stationary
in
the
and
leathers
charlotte
treated
him
ill
because
noah
did
and
sowerberry
was
his
decided
enemy
because
sowerberry
was
disposed
to
be
his
friend
so
between
these
three
on
one
side
and
a
glut
of
funerals
on
the
other
oliver
was
not
altogether
as
comfortable
as
the
hungry
pig
was
when
he
was
shut
up
by
mistake
in
the
grain
department
of
a
brewery
and
now
i
come
to
a
very
important
passage
in
oliver
history
for
i
have
to
record
an
act
slight
and
unimportant
perhaps
in
appearance
but
which
indirectly
produced
a
material
change
in
all
his
future
prospects
and
proceedings
one
day
oliver
and
noah
had
descended
into
the
kitchen
at
the
usual
to
banquet
upon
a
small
joint
of
mutton
a
pound
and
a
half
of
the
worst
end
of
the
neck
when
charlotte
being
called
out
of
the
way
there
ensued
a
brief
interval
of
time
which
noah
claypole
being
hungry
and
vicious
considered
he
could
not
possibly
devote
to
a
worthier
purpose
than
aggravating
and
tantalising
young
oliver
twist
intent
upon
this
innocent
amusement
noah
put
his
feet
on
the
and
pulled
oliver
hair
and
twitched
his
ears
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
he
was
a
and
furthermore
announced
his
intention
of
coming
to
see
him
hanged
whenever
that
desirable
event
should
take
place
and
entered
upon
various
topics
of
petty
annoyance
like
a
malicious
and
as
he
was
but
making
oliver
cry
noah
attempted
to
be
more
facetious
still
and
in
his
attempt
did
what
many
sometimes
do
to
this
day
when
they
want
to
be
funny
he
got
rather
personal
said
noah
your
mother
dead
replied
oliver
you
say
anything
about
her
to
me
oliver
colour
rose
as
he
said
this
he
breathed
quickly
and
there
was
a
curious
working
of
the
mouth
and
nostrils
which
claypole
thought
must
be
the
immediate
precursor
of
a
violent
fit
of
crying
under
this
impression
he
returned
to
the
charge
did
she
die
of
said
noah
a
broken
heart
some
of
our
old
nurses
told
me
replied
oliver
more
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
than
answering
noah
think
i
know
what
it
must
be
to
die
of
that
de
rol
lol
lol
right
fol
lairy
said
noah
as
a
tear
rolled
down
oliver
cheek
set
you
a
snivelling
now
replied
oliver
sharply
that
enough
do
say
anything
more
to
me
about
her
you
better
not
not
exclaimed
noah
better
not
do
be
impudent
mother
too
she
was
a
nice
she
was
oh
lor
and
here
noah
nodded
his
head
expressively
and
curled
up
as
much
of
his
small
red
nose
as
muscular
action
could
collect
together
for
the
occasion
know
continued
noah
emboldened
by
oliver
silence
and
speaking
in
a
jeering
tone
of
affected
pity
of
all
tones
the
most
annoying
know
it
ca
be
helped
now
and
of
course
yer
could
help
it
then
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
and
i
sure
we
all
are
and
pity
yer
very
much
but
yer
must
know
yer
mother
was
a
regular
bad
did
you
say
inquired
oliver
looking
up
very
quickly
regular
bad
replied
noah
coolly
it
a
great
deal
better
that
she
died
when
she
did
or
else
she
have
been
hard
labouring
in
bridewell
or
transported
or
hung
which
is
more
likely
than
either
is
it
crimson
with
fury
oliver
started
up
overthrew
the
chair
and
table
seized
noah
by
the
throat
shook
him
in
the
violence
of
his
rage
till
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
and
collecting
his
whole
force
into
one
heavy
blow
felled
him
to
the
ground
a
minute
ago
the
boy
had
looked
the
quiet
child
mild
dejected
creature
that
harsh
treatment
had
made
him
but
his
spirit
was
roused
at
last
the
cruel
insult
to
his
dead
mother
had
set
his
blood
on
fire
his
breast
heaved
his
attitude
was
erect
his
eye
bright
and
vivid
his
whole
person
changed
as
he
stood
glaring
over
the
cowardly
tormentor
who
now
lay
crouching
at
his
feet
and
defied
him
with
an
energy
he
had
never
known
before
murder
me
blubbered
noah
missis
here
the
new
boy
a
murdering
of
me
help
help
oliver
gone
mad
char
lotte
noah
shouts
were
responded
to
by
a
loud
scream
from
charlotte
and
a
louder
from
sowerberry
the
former
of
whom
rushed
into
the
kitchen
by
a
while
the
latter
paused
on
the
staircase
till
she
was
quite
certain
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
human
life
to
come
further
down
you
little
wretch
screamed
charlotte
seizing
oliver
with
her
utmost
force
which
was
about
equal
to
that
of
a
moderately
strong
man
in
particularly
good
training
you
little
villain
and
between
every
syllable
charlotte
gave
oliver
a
blow
with
all
her
might
accompanying
it
with
a
scream
for
the
benefit
of
society
charlotte
fist
was
by
no
means
a
light
one
but
lest
it
should
not
be
effectual
in
calming
oliver
wrath
sowerberry
plunged
into
the
kitchen
and
assisted
to
hold
him
with
one
hand
while
she
scratched
his
face
with
the
other
in
this
favourable
position
of
affairs
noah
rose
from
the
ground
and
pommelled
him
behind
this
was
rather
too
violent
exercise
to
last
long
when
they
were
all
wearied
out
and
could
tear
and
beat
no
longer
they
dragged
oliver
struggling
and
shouting
but
nothing
daunted
into
the
and
there
locked
him
up
this
being
done
sowerberry
sunk
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears

noah
dear
make
haste
charlotte
said
sowerberry
speaking
as
well
as
she
could
through
a
deficiency
of
breath
and
a
sufficiency
of
cold
water
which
noah
had
poured
over
her
head
and
shoulders
charlotte
what
a
mercy
we
have
not
all
been
murdered
in
our
beds
mercy
indeed
was
the
reply
i
only
hope
this
teach
master
not
to
have
any
more
of
these
dreadful
creatures
that
are
born
to
be
murderers
and
robbers
from
their
very
cradle
poor
noah
he
was
all
but
killed
when
i
come
in
fellow
said
sowerberry
looking
piteously
on
the
noah
whose
top
might
have
been
somewhere
on
a
level
with
the
crown
of
oliver
head
rubbed
his
eyes
with
the
inside
of
his
wrists
while
this
commiseration
was
bestowed
upon
him
and
performed
some
affecting
tears
and
sniffs
to
be
done
exclaimed
sowerberry
master
not
at
home
there
not
a
man
in
the
house
and
he
kick
that
door
down
in
ten
minutes
oliver
vigorous
plunges
against
the
bit
of
timber
in
question
rendered
this
occurance
highly
probable
dear
i
do
know
said
charlotte
we
send
for
the
the
millingtary
suggested
claypole
no
said
sowerberry
bethinking
herself
of
oliver
old
friend
to
bumble
noah
and
tell
him
to
come
here
directly
and
not
to
lose
a
minute
never

your
cap
make
haste
you
can
hold
a
knife
to
that
black
eye
as
you
run
along

the
swelling
down
noah
stopped
to
make
no
reply
but
started
off
at
his
fullest
speed
and
very
much
it
astonished
the
people
who
were
out
walking
to
see
a
tearing
through
the
streets
with
no
cap
on
his
head
and
a
at
his
eye
chapter
vii
oliver
continues
refractory
noah
claypole
ran
along
the
streets
at
his
swiftest
pace
and
paused
not
once
for
breath
until
he
reached
the
having
rested
here
for
a
minute
or
so
to
collect
a
good
burst
of
sobs
and
an
imposing
show
of
tears
and
terror
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
wicket
and
presented
such
a
rueful
face
to
the
aged
pauper
who
opened
it
that
even
he
who
saw
nothing
but
rueful
faces
about
him
at
the
best
of
times
started
back
in
astonishment
what
the
matter
with
the
boy
said
the
old
pauper
bumble
mr
bumble
cried
noah
with
dismay
and
in
tones
so
loud
and
agitated
that
they
not
only
caught
the
ear
of
bumble
himself
who
happened
to
be
hard
by
but
alarmed
him
so
much
that
he
rushed
into
the
yard
without
his
cocked
hat
which
is
a
very
curious
and
remarkable
circumstance
as
showing
that
even
a
beadle
acted
upon
a
sudden
and
powerful
impulse
may
be
afflicted
with
a
momentary
visitation
of
loss
of
and
forgetfulness
of
personal
dignity
bumble
sir
said
noah
sir
oliver
has
what
interposed
bumble
with
a
gleam
of
pleasure
in
his
metallic
eyes
run
away
he
has
run
away
has
he
noah
sir
no
not
run
away
sir
but
he
turned
wicious
replied
noah
tried
to
murder
me
sir
and
then
he
tried
to
murder
charlotte
and
then
missis
oh
what
dreadful
pain
it
is
such
agony
please
sir
and
here
noah
writhed
and
twisted
his
body
into
an
extensive
variety
of
positions
thereby
giving
bumble
to
understand
that
from
the
violent
and
sanguinary
onset
of
oliver
twist
he
had
sustained
severe
internal
injury
and
damage
from
which
he
was
at
that
moment
suffering
the
acutest
torture
when
noah
saw
that
the
intelligence
he
communicated
perfectly
paralysed
bumble
he
imparted
additional
effect
thereunto
by
bewailing
his
dreadful
wounds
ten
times
louder
than
before
and
when
he
observed
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
crossing
the
yard
he
was
more
tragic
in
his
lamentations
than
ever
rightly
conceiving
it
highly
expedient
to
attract
the
notice
and
rouse
the
indignation
of
the
gentleman
aforesaid
the
gentleman
notice
was
very
soon
attracted
for
he
had
not
walked
three
paces
when
he
turned
angrily
round
and
inquired
what
that
young
cur
was
howling
for
and
why
bumble
did
not
favour
him
with
something
which
would
render
the
series
of
vocular
exclamations
so
designated
an
involuntary
process
a
poor
boy
from
the
sir
replied
bumble
has
been
nearly
murdered
all
but
murdered
sir
by
young
twist
jove
exclaimed
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
stopping
short
knew
it
i
felt
a
strange
presentiment
from
the
very
first
that
that
audacious
young
savage
would
come
to
be
hung
has
likewise
attempted
sir
to
murder
the
female
servant
said
bumble
with
a
face
of
ashy
paleness
his
missis
interposed
claypole
his
master
too
i
think
you
said
noah
added
bumble
he
out
or
he
would
have
murdered
him
replied
noah
said
he
wanted
to
said
he
wanted
to
did
he
my
boy
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
sir
replied
noah
please
sir
missis
wants
to
know
whether
bumble
can
spare
time
to
step
up
there
directly
and
flog
him
master
out
my
boy
certainly
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
smiling
benignly
and
patting
noah
head
which
was
about
three
inches
higher
than
his
own
a
good
boy
a
very
good
boy
here
a
penny
for
you
bumble
just
step
up
to
sowerberry
with
your
cane
and
see
what
best
to
be
done
do
spare
him
bumble
i
will
not
sir
replied
the
beadle
and
the
cocked
hat
and
cane
having
been
by
this
time
adjusted
to
their
owner
satisfaction
bumble
and
noah
claypole
betook
themselves
with
all
speed
to
the
undertaker
shop
here
the
position
of
affairs
had
not
at
all
improved
sowerberry
had
not
yet
returned
and
oliver
continued
to
kick
with
undiminished
vigour
at
the
the
accounts
of
his
ferocity
as
related
by
sowerberry
and
charlotte
were
of
so
startling
a
nature
that
bumble
judged
it
prudent
to
parley
before
opening
the
door
with
this
view
he
gave
a
kick
at
the
outside
by
way
of
prelude
and
then
applying
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
said
in
a
deep
and
impressive
tone
you
let
me
out
replied
oliver
from
the
inside
you
know
this
here
voice
oliver
said
bumble
replied
oliver
you
afraid
of
it
sir
ai
you
while
i
speak
sir
said
bumble
replied
oliver
boldly
an
answer
so
different
from
the
one
he
had
expected
to
elicit
and
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
staggered
bumble
not
a
little
he
stepped
back
from
the
keyhole
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
three
bystanders
in
mute
astonishment
you
know
bumble
he
must
be
mad
said
sowerberry
boy
in
half
his
senses
could
venture
to
speak
so
to
you
not
madness
replied
bumble
after
a
few
moments
of
deep
meditation
meat
exclaimed
sowerberry
meat
replied
bumble
with
stern
emphasis
him
you
raised
a
artificial
soul
and
spirit
in
him
unbecoming
a
person
of
his
condition
as
the
board
sowerberry
who
are
practical
philosophers
will
tell
you
what
have
paupers
to
do
with
soul
or
spirit
it
quite
enough
that
we
let
have
live
bodies
if
you
had
kept
the
boy
on
gruel
this
would
never
have
happened
dear
ejaculated
sowerberry
piously
raising
her
eyes
to
the
kitchen
ceiling
comes
of
being
liberal
the
liberality
of
sowerberry
to
oliver
had
consisted
of
a
profuse
bestowal
upon
him
of
all
the
dirty
odds
and
ends
which
nobody
else
would
eat
so
there
was
a
great
deal
of
meekness
and
in
her
voluntarily
remaining
under
bumble
heavy
accusation
of
which
to
do
her
justice
she
was
wholly
innocent
in
thought
word
or
deed
said
bumble
when
the
lady
brought
her
eyes
down
to
earth
again
only
thing
that
can
be
done
now
that
i
know
of
is
to
leave
him
in
the
cellar
for
a
day
or
so
till
he
a
little
starved
down
and
then
to
take
him
out
and
keep
him
on
gruel
all
through
the
apprenticeship
he
comes
of
a
bad
family
excitable
natures
sowerberry
both
the
nurse
and
doctor
said
that
that
mother
of
his
made
her
way
here
against
difficulties
and
pain
that
would
have
killed
any
woman
weeks
before
at
this
point
of
bumble
discourse
oliver
just
hearing
enough
to
know
that
some
allusion
was
being
made
to
his
mother
recommenced
kicking
with
a
violence
that
rendered
every
other
sound
inaudible
sowerberry
returned
at
this
juncture
oliver
offence
having
been
explained
to
him
with
such
exaggerations
as
the
ladies
thought
best
calculated
to
rouse
his
ire
he
unlocked
the
in
a
twinkling
and
dragged
his
rebellious
apprentice
out
by
the
collar
oliver
clothes
had
been
torn
in
the
beating
he
had
received
his
face
was
bruised
and
scratched
and
his
hair
scattered
over
his
forehead
the
angry
flush
had
not
disappeared
however
and
when
he
was
pulled
out
of
his
prison
he
scowled
boldly
on
noah
and
looked
quite
undismayed
you
are
a
nice
young
fellow
ai
you
said
sowerberry
giving
oliver
a
shake
and
a
box
on
the
ear
called
my
mother
names
replied
oliver
and
what
if
he
did
you
little
ungrateful
wretch
said
sowerberry
deserved
what
he
said
and
worse
did
said
oliver
did
said
sowerberry
a
lie
said
oliver
sowerberry
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
this
flood
of
tears
left
sowerberry
no
alternative
if
he
had
hesitated
for
one
instant
to
punish
oliver
most
severely
it
must
be
quite
clear
to
every
experienced
reader
that
he
would
have
been
according
to
all
precedents
in
disputes
of
matrimony
established
a
brute
an
unnatural
husband
an
insulting
creature
a
base
imitation
of
a
man
and
various
other
agreeable
characters
too
numerous
for
recital
within
the
limits
of
this
chapter
to
do
him
justice
he
was
as
far
as
his
power
went
it
was
not
very
extensive
kindly
disposed
towards
the
boy
perhaps
because
it
was
his
interest
to
be
so
perhaps
because
his
wife
disliked
him
the
flood
of
tears
however
left
him
no
resource
so
he
at
once
gave
him
a
drubbing
which
satisfied
even
sowerberry
herself
and
rendered
bumble
subsequent
application
of
the
parochial
cane
rather
unnecessary
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
was
shut
up
in
the
back
kitchen
in
company
with
a
pump
and
a
slice
of
bread
and
at
night
sowerberry
after
making
various
remarks
outside
the
door
by
no
means
complimentary
to
the
memory
of
his
mother
looked
into
the
room
and
amidst
the
jeers
and
pointings
of
noah
and
charlotte
ordered
him
upstairs
to
his
dismal
bed
it
was
not
until
he
was
left
alone
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
gloomy
workshop
of
the
undertaker
that
oliver
gave
way
to
the
feelings
which
the
day
treatment
may
be
supposed
likely
to
have
awakened
in
a
mere
child
he
had
listened
to
their
taunts
with
a
look
of
contempt
he
had
borne
the
lash
without
a
cry
for
he
felt
that
pride
swelling
in
his
heart
which
would
have
kept
down
a
shriek
to
the
last
though
they
had
roasted
him
alive
but
now
when
there
were
none
to
see
or
hear
him
he
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
floor
and
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
wept
such
tears
as
god
send
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
few
so
young
may
ever
have
cause
to
pour
out
before
him
for
a
long
time
oliver
remained
motionless
in
this
attitude
the
candle
was
burning
low
in
the
socket
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
having
gazed
cautiously
round
him
and
listened
intently
he
gently
undid
the
fastenings
of
the
door
and
looked
abroad
it
was
a
cold
dark
night
the
stars
seemed
to
the
boy
eyes
farther
from
the
earth
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
before
there
was
no
wind
and
the
sombre
shadows
thrown
by
the
trees
upon
the
ground
looked
sepulchral
and
from
being
so
still
he
softly
reclosed
the
door
having
availed
himself
of
the
expiring
light
of
the
candle
to
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
the
few
articles
of
wearing
apparel
he
had
sat
himself
down
upon
a
bench
to
wait
for
morning
with
the
first
ray
of
light
that
struggled
through
the
crevices
in
the
shutters
oliver
arose
and
again
unbarred
the
door
one
timid
look
around
one
moment
pause
of
hesitation
he
had
closed
it
behind
him
and
was
in
the
open
street
he
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
uncertain
whither
to
fly
he
remembered
to
have
seen
the
waggons
as
they
went
out
toiling
up
the
hill
he
took
the
same
route
and
arriving
at
a
footpath
across
the
fields
which
he
knew
after
some
distance
led
out
again
into
the
road
struck
into
it
and
walked
quickly
on
along
this
same
footpath
oliver
he
had
trotted
beside
bumble
when
he
first
carried
him
to
the
workhouse
from
the
farm
his
way
lay
directly
in
front
of
the
cottage
his
heart
beat
quickly
when
he
bethought
himself
of
this
and
he
half
resolved
to
turn
back
he
had
come
a
long
way
though
and
should
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
by
doing
so
besides
it
was
so
early
that
there
was
very
little
fear
of
his
being
seen
so
he
walked
on
he
reached
the
house
there
was
no
appearance
of
its
inmates
stirring
at
that
early
hour
oliver
stopped
and
peeped
into
the
garden
a
child
was
weeding
one
of
the
little
beds
as
he
stopped
he
raised
his
pale
face
and
disclosed
the
features
of
one
of
his
former
companions
oliver
felt
glad
to
see
him
before
he
went
for
though
younger
than
himself
he
had
been
his
little
friend
and
playmate
they
had
been
beaten
and
starved
and
shut
up
together
many
and
many
a
time
dick
said
oliver
as
the
boy
ran
to
the
gate
and
thrust
his
thin
arm
between
the
rails
to
greet
him
any
one
up
but
me
replied
the
child
mus
say
you
saw
me
dick
said
oliver
am
running
away
they
beat
and
me
dick
and
i
am
going
to
seek
my
fortune
some
long
way
off
i
do
know
where
how
pale
you
are
heard
the
doctor
tell
them
i
was
dying
replied
the
child
with
a
faint
smile
am
very
glad
to
see
you
dear
but
do
stop
stop
yes
i
will
to
say
to
you
replied
oliver

see
you
again
dick
i
know
i
shall
you
will
be
well
and
happy
hope
so
replied
the
child
i
am
dead
but
not
before
i
know
the
doctor
must
be
right
oliver
because
i
dream
so
much
of
heaven
and
angels
and
kind
faces
that
i
never
see
when
i
am
awake
kiss
me
said
the
child
climbing
up
the
low
gate
and
flinging
his
little
arms
round
oliver
neck
dear
god
bless
you
the
blessing
was
from
a
young
child
lips
but
it
was
the
first
that
oliver
had
ever
heard
invoked
upon
his
head
and
through
the
struggles
and
sufferings
and
troubles
and
changes
of
his
after
life
he
never
once
forgot
it
chapter
viii
oliver
walks
to
london
he
encounters
on
the
road
a
strange
sort
of
young
gentleman
oliver
reached
the
stile
at
which
the
terminated
and
once
more
gained
the
it
was
eight
now
though
he
was
nearly
five
miles
away
from
the
town
he
ran
and
hid
behind
the
hedges
by
turns
till
noon
fearing
that
he
might
be
pursued
and
overtaken
then
he
sat
down
to
rest
by
the
side
of
the
milestone
and
began
to
think
for
the
first
time
where
he
had
better
go
and
try
to
live
the
stone
by
which
he
was
seated
bore
in
large
characters
an
intimation
that
it
was
just
seventy
miles
from
that
spot
to
london
the
name
awakened
a
new
train
of
ideas
in
the
boy
mind
london
that
great
place
nobody
not
even
bumble
could
ever
find
him
there
he
had
often
heard
the
old
men
in
the
workhouse
too
say
that
no
lad
of
spirit
need
want
in
london
and
that
there
were
ways
of
living
in
that
vast
city
which
those
who
had
been
bred
up
in
country
parts
had
no
idea
of
it
was
the
very
place
for
a
homeless
boy
who
must
die
in
the
streets
unless
some
one
helped
him
as
these
things
passed
through
his
thoughts
he
jumped
upon
his
feet
and
again
walked
forward
he
had
diminished
the
distance
between
himself
and
london
by
full
four
miles
more
before
he
recollected
how
much
he
must
undergo
ere
he
could
hope
to
reach
his
place
of
destination
as
this
consideration
forced
itself
upon
him
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
and
meditated
upon
his
means
of
getting
there
he
had
a
crust
of
bread
a
coarse
shirt
and
two
pairs
of
stockings
in
his
bundle
he
had
a
penny
too
a
gift
of
sowerberry
after
some
funeral
in
which
he
had
acquitted
himself
more
than
ordinarily
well
in
his
pocket
clean
shirt
thought
oliver
a
very
comfortable
thing
and
so
are
two
pairs
of
darned
stockings
and
so
is
a
penny
but
they
are
small
helps
to
a
miles
walk
in
winter
time
but
oliver
thoughts
like
those
of
most
other
people
although
they
were
extremely
ready
and
active
to
point
out
his
difficulties
were
wholly
at
a
loss
to
suggest
any
feasible
mode
of
surmounting
them
so
after
a
good
deal
of
thinking
to
no
particular
purpose
he
changed
his
little
bundle
over
to
the
other
shoulder
and
trudged
on
oliver
walked
twenty
miles
that
day
and
all
that
time
tasted
nothing
but
the
crust
of
dry
bread
and
a
few
draughts
of
water
which
he
begged
at
the
by
the
when
the
night
came
he
turned
into
a
meadow
and
creeping
close
under
a
determined
to
lie
there
till
morning
he
felt
frightened
at
first
for
the
wind
moaned
dismally
over
the
empty
fields
and
he
was
cold
and
hungry
and
more
alone
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
being
very
tired
with
his
walk
however
he
soon
fell
asleep
and
forgot
his
troubles
he
felt
cold
and
stiff
when
he
got
up
next
morning
and
so
hungry
that
he
was
obliged
to
exchange
the
penny
for
a
small
loaf
in
the
very
first
village
through
which
he
passed
he
had
walked
no
more
than
twelve
miles
when
night
closed
in
again
his
feet
were
sore
and
his
legs
so
weak
that
they
trembled
beneath
him
another
night
passed
in
the
bleak
damp
air
made
him
worse
when
he
set
forward
on
his
journey
next
morning
he
could
hardly
crawl
along
he
waited
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
hill
till
a
came
up
and
then
begged
of
the
outside
passengers
but
there
were
very
few
who
took
any
notice
of
him
and
even
those
told
him
to
wait
till
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
then
let
them
see
how
far
he
could
run
for
a
halfpenny
poor
oliver
tried
to
keep
up
with
the
coach
a
little
way
but
was
unable
to
do
it
by
reason
of
his
fatigue
and
sore
feet
when
the
outsides
saw
this
they
put
their
halfpence
back
into
their
pockets
again
declaring
that
he
was
an
idle
young
dog
and
did
deserve
anything
and
the
coach
rattled
away
and
left
only
a
cloud
of
dust
behind
in
some
villages
large
painted
boards
were
fixed
up
warning
all
persons
who
begged
within
the
district
that
they
would
be
sent
to
jail
this
frightened
oliver
very
much
and
made
him
glad
to
get
out
of
those
villages
with
all
possible
expedition
in
others
he
would
stand
about
the
and
look
mournfully
at
every
one
who
passed
a
proceeding
which
generally
terminated
in
the
landlady
ordering
one
of
the
who
were
lounging
about
to
drive
that
strange
boy
out
of
the
place
for
she
was
sure
he
had
come
to
steal
something
if
he
begged
at
a
farmer
house
ten
to
one
but
they
threatened
to
set
the
dog
on
him
and
when
he
showed
his
nose
in
a
shop
they
talked
about
the
beadle
which
brought
oliver
heart
into
his
mouth
very
often
the
only
thing
he
had
there
for
many
hours
together
in
fact
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
and
a
benevolent
old
lady
oliver
troubles
would
have
been
shortened
by
the
very
same
process
which
had
put
an
end
to
his
mother
in
other
words
he
would
most
assuredly
have
fallen
dead
upon
the
king
highway
but
the
gave
him
a
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
and
the
old
lady
who
had
a
shipwrecked
grandson
wandering
barefoot
in
some
distant
part
of
the
earth
took
pity
upon
the
poor
orphan
and
gave
him
what
little
she
could
afford
and
more
with
such
kind
and
gentle
words
and
such
tears
of
sympathy
and
compassion
that
they
sank
deeper
into
soul
than
all
the
sufferings
he
had
ever
undergone
early
on
the
seventh
morning
after
he
had
left
his
native
place
oliver
limped
slowly
into
the
little
town
of
barnet
the
were
closed
the
street
was
empty
not
a
soul
had
awakened
to
the
business
of
the
day
the
sun
was
rising
in
all
its
splendid
beauty
but
the
light
only
served
to
show
the
boy
his
own
lonesomeness
and
desolation
as
he
sat
with
bleeding
feet
and
covered
with
dust
upon
a
by
degrees
the
shutters
were
opened
the
were
drawn
up
and
people
began
passing
to
and
fro
some
few
stopped
to
gaze
at
oliver
for
a
moment
or
two
or
turned
round
to
stare
at
him
as
they
hurried
by
but
none
relieved
him
or
troubled
themselves
to
inquire
how
he
came
there
he
had
no
heart
to
beg
and
there
he
sat
he
had
been
crouching
on
the
step
for
some
time
wondering
at
the
great
number
of
every
other
house
in
barnet
was
a
tavern
large
or
small
gazing
listlessly
at
the
coaches
as
they
passed
through
and
thinking
how
strange
it
seemed
that
they
could
do
with
ease
in
a
few
hours
what
it
had
taken
him
a
whole
week
of
courage
and
determination
beyond
his
years
to
accomplish
when
he
was
roused
by
observing
that
a
boy
who
had
passed
him
carelessly
some
minutes
before
had
returned
and
was
now
surveying
him
most
earnestly
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
he
took
little
heed
of
this
at
first
but
the
boy
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
close
observation
so
long
that
oliver
raised
his
head
and
returned
his
steady
look
upon
this
the
boy
crossed
over
and
walking
close
up
to
oliver
said
my
covey
what
the
row
the
boy
who
addressed
this
inquiry
to
the
young
wayfarer
was
about
his
own
age
but
one
of
the
queerest
looking
boys
that
oliver
had
even
seen
he
was
a
boy
enough
and
as
dirty
a
juvenile
as
one
would
wish
to
see
but
he
had
about
him
all
the
airs
and
manners
of
a
man
he
was
short
of
his
age
with
rather
and
little
sharp
ugly
eyes
his
hat
was
stuck
on
the
top
of
his
head
so
lightly
that
it
threatened
to
fall
off
every
moment
and
would
have
done
so
very
often
if
the
wearer
had
not
had
a
knack
of
every
now
and
then
giving
his
head
a
sudden
twitch
which
brought
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
he
wore
a
man
coat
which
reached
nearly
to
his
heels
he
had
turned
the
cuffs
back
up
his
arm
to
get
his
hands
out
of
the
sleeves
apparently
with
the
ultimate
view
of
thrusting
them
into
the
pockets
of
his
corduroy
trousers
for
there
he
kept
them
he
was
altogether
as
roystering
and
swaggering
a
young
gentleman
as
ever
stood
four
feet
six
or
something
less
in
the
bluchers
my
covey
what
the
row
said
this
strange
young
gentleman
to
oliver
am
very
hungry
and
tired
replied
oliver
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
have
walked
a
long
way
i
have
been
walking
these
seven
days
for
sivin
days
said
the
young
gentleman
i
see
order
eh
but
he
added
noticing
oliver
look
of
surprise
suppose
you
do
know
what
a
beak
is
my
flash
oliver
mildly
replied
that
he
had
always
heard
a
bird
mouth
described
by
the
term
in
question
eyes
how
green
exclaimed
the
young
gentleman
a
beak
a
and
when
you
walk
by
a
beak
order
it
not
straight
forerd
but
always
agoing
up
and
niver
a
coming
down
agin
was
you
never
on
the
mill
mill
inquired
oliver
mill
why
mill
the
mill
as
takes
up
so
little
room
that
it
work
inside
a
stone
jug
and
always
goes
better
when
the
low
with
people
than
when
it
high
acos
then
they
ca
get
workmen
but
come
said
the
young
gentleman
want
grub
and
you
shall
have
it
i
at
myself
only
one
bob
and
a
magpie
but
as
far
as
it
goes
i
fork
out
and
stump
up
with
you
on
your
pins
there
now
then
assisting
oliver
to
rise
the
young
gentleman
took
him
to
an
adjacent
chandler
shop
where
he
purchased
a
sufficiency
of
ham
and
a
loaf
or
as
he
himself
expressed
it
fourpenny
bran
the
ham
being
kept
clean
and
preserved
from
dust
by
the
ingenious
expedient
of
making
a
hole
in
the
loaf
by
pulling
out
a
portion
of
the
crumb
and
stuffing
it
therein
taking
the
bread
under
his
arm
the
young
gentlman
turned
into
a
small
and
led
the
way
to
a
in
the
rear
of
the
premises
here
a
pot
of
beer
was
brought
in
by
direction
of
the
mysterious
youth
and
oliver
falling
to
at
his
new
friend
bidding
made
a
long
and
hearty
meal
during
the
progress
of
which
the
strange
boy
eyed
him
from
time
to
time
with
great
attention
to
london
said
the
strange
boy
when
oliver
had
at
length
concluded
any
lodgings
the
strange
boy
whistled
and
put
his
arms
into
his
pockets
as
far
as
the
big
would
let
them
go
you
live
in
london
inquired
oliver
i
do
when
i
at
home
replied
the
boy
suppose
you
want
some
place
to
sleep
in
do
you
do
indeed
answered
oliver
have
not
slept
under
a
roof
since
i
left
the
country
fret
your
eyelids
on
that
score
said
the
young
gentleman
got
to
be
in
london
and
i
know
a
old
gentleman
as
lives
there
wot
give
you
lodgings
for
nothink
and
never
ask
for
the
change
that
is
if
any
genelman
he
knows
interduces
you
and
do
he
know
me
oh
no
not
in
the
least
by
no
means
certainly
not
the
young
gentleman
smiled
as
if
to
intimate
that
the
latter
fragments
of
discourse
were
playfully
ironical
and
finished
the
beer
as
he
did
so
this
unexpected
offer
of
shelter
was
too
tempting
to
be
resisted
especially
as
it
was
immediately
followed
up
by
the
assurance
that
the
old
gentleman
referred
to
would
doubtless
provide
oliver
with
a
comfortable
place
without
loss
of
time
this
led
to
a
more
friendly
and
confidential
dialogue
from
which
oliver
discovered
that
his
friend
name
was
jack
dawkins
and
that
he
was
a
peculiar
pet
and
protege
of
the
elderly
gentleman
before
mentioned
dawkin
appearance
did
not
say
a
vast
deal
in
favour
of
the
comforts
which
his
patron
interest
obtained
for
those
whom
he
took
under
his
protection
but
as
he
had
a
rather
flightly
and
dissolute
mode
of
conversing
and
furthermore
avowed
that
among
his
intimate
friends
he
was
better
known
by
the
sobriquet
of
artful
dodger
oliver
concluded
that
being
of
a
dissipated
and
careless
turn
the
moral
precepts
of
his
benefactor
had
hitherto
been
thrown
away
upon
him
under
this
impression
he
secretly
resolved
to
cultivate
the
good
opinion
of
the
old
gentleman
as
quickly
as
possible
and
if
he
found
the
dodger
incorrigible
as
he
more
than
half
suspected
he
should
to
decline
the
honour
of
his
farther
acquaintance
as
john
dawkins
objected
to
their
entering
london
before
nightfall
it
was
nearly
eleven
when
they
reached
the
turnpike
at
islington
they
crossed
from
the
angel
into
john
road
struck
down
the
small
street
which
terminates
at
sadler
wells
theatre
through
exmouth
street
and
coppice
row
down
the
little
court
by
the
side
of
the
workhouse
across
the
classic
ground
which
once
bore
the
name
of
thence
into
little
saffron
hill
and
so
into
saffron
hill
the
great
along
which
the
dodger
scudded
at
a
rapid
pace
directing
oliver
to
follow
close
at
his
heels
although
oliver
had
enough
to
occupy
his
attention
in
keeping
sight
of
his
leader
he
could
not
help
bestowing
a
few
hasty
glances
on
either
side
of
the
way
as
he
passed
along
a
dirtier
or
more
wretched
place
he
had
never
seen
the
street
was
very
narrow
and
muddy
and
the
air
was
impregnated
with
filthy
odours
there
were
a
good
many
small
shops
but
the
only
stock
in
trade
appeared
to
be
heaps
of
children
who
even
at
that
time
of
night
were
crawling
in
and
out
at
the
doors
or
screaming
from
the
inside
the
sole
places
that
seemed
to
prosper
amid
the
general
blight
of
the
place
were
the
and
in
them
the
lowest
orders
of
irish
were
wrangling
with
might
and
main
covered
ways
and
yards
which
here
and
there
diverged
from
the
main
street
disclosed
little
knots
of
houses
where
drunken
men
and
women
were
positively
wallowing
in
filth
and
from
several
of
the
great
fellows
were
cautiously
emerging
bound
to
all
appearance
on
no
very
or
harmless
errands
oliver
was
just
considering
whether
he
had
better
run
away
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
his
conductor
catching
him
by
the
arm
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
house
near
field
lane
and
drawing
him
into
the
passage
closed
it
behind
them
then
cried
a
voice
from
below
in
reply
to
a
whistle
from
the
dodger
and
slam
was
the
reply
this
seemed
to
be
some
watchword
or
signal
that
all
was
right
for
the
light
of
a
feeble
candle
gleamed
on
the
wall
at
the
remote
end
of
the
passage
and
a
man
face
peeped
out
from
where
a
balustrade
of
the
old
kitchen
staircase
had
been
broken
away
two
on
you
said
the
man
thrusting
the
candle
farther
out
and
shielding
his
eyes
with
his
hand
the
one
new
pal
replied
jack
dawkins
pulling
oliver
forward
did
he
come
from
is
fagin
upstairs
he
a
sortin
the
wipes
up
with
you
the
candle
was
drawn
back
and
the
face
disappeared
oliver
groping
his
way
with
one
hand
and
having
the
other
firmly
grasped
by
his
companion
ascended
with
much
difficulty
the
dark
and
broken
stairs
which
his
conductor
mounted
with
an
ease
and
expedition
that
showed
he
was
well
acquainted
with
them
he
threw
open
the
door
of
a
and
drew
oliver
in
after
him
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
room
were
perfectly
black
with
age
and
dirt
there
was
a
deal
table
before
the
fire
upon
which
were
a
candle
stuck
in
a
bottle
two
or
three
pewter
pots
a
loaf
and
butter
and
a
plate
in
a
which
was
on
the
fire
and
which
was
secured
to
the
mantelshelf
by
a
string
some
sausages
were
cooking
and
standing
over
them
with
a
in
his
hand
was
a
very
old
shrivelled
jew
whose
and
repulsive
face
was
obscured
by
a
quantity
of
matted
red
hair
he
was
dressed
in
a
greasy
flannel
gown
with
his
throat
bare
and
seemed
to
be
dividing
his
attention
between
the
and
the
over
which
a
great
number
of
silk
handkerchiefs
were
hanging
several
rough
beds
made
of
old
sacks
were
huddled
side
by
side
on
the
floor
seated
round
the
table
were
four
or
five
boys
none
older
than
the
dodger
smoking
long
clay
pipes
and
drinking
spirits
with
the
air
of
men
these
all
crowded
about
their
associate
as
he
whispered
a
few
words
to
the
jew
and
then
turned
round
and
grinned
at
oliver
so
did
the
jew
himself
in
hand
is
him
fagin
said
jack
dawkins
friend
oliver
twist
the
jew
grinned
and
making
a
low
obeisance
to
oliver
took
him
by
the
hand
and
hoped
he
should
have
the
honour
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
upon
this
the
young
gentleman
with
the
pipes
came
round
him
and
shook
both
his
hands
very
hard
especially
the
one
in
which
he
held
his
little
bundle
one
young
gentleman
was
very
anxious
to
hang
up
his
cap
for
him
and
another
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
in
order
that
as
he
was
very
tired
he
might
not
have
the
trouble
of
emptying
them
himself
when
he
went
to
bed
these
civilities
would
probably
be
extended
much
farther
but
for
a
liberal
exercise
of
the
jew
on
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
affectionate
youths
who
offered
them
are
very
glad
to
see
you
oliver
very
said
the
jew
take
off
the
sausages
and
draw
a
tub
near
the
fire
for
oliver
ah
you
at
the
eh
my
dear
there
are
a
good
many
of
ai
there
we
just
looked
out
ready
for
the
wash
that
all
oliver
that
all
ha
ha
ha
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
hailed
by
a
boisterous
shout
from
all
the
hopeful
pupils
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
in
the
midst
of
which
they
went
to
supper
oliver
ate
his
share
and
the
jew
then
mixed
him
a
glass
of
hot
telling
him
he
must
drink
it
off
directly
because
another
gentleman
wanted
the
tumbler
oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
immediately
afterwards
he
felt
himself
gently
lifted
on
to
one
of
the
sacks
and
then
he
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
chapter
ix
containing
further
particulars
concerning
the
pleasant
old
gentleman
and
his
hopeful
pupils
it
was
late
next
morning
when
oliver
awoke
from
a
sound
long
sleep
there
was
no
other
person
in
the
room
but
the
old
jew
who
was
boiling
some
coffee
in
a
saucepan
for
breakfast
and
whistling
softly
to
himself
as
he
stirred
it
round
and
round
with
an
iron
spoon
he
would
stop
every
now
and
then
to
listen
when
there
was
the
least
noise
below
and
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
he
would
go
on
whistling
and
stirring
again
as
before
although
oliver
had
roused
himself
from
sleep
he
was
not
thoroughly
awake
there
is
a
drowsy
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
when
you
dream
more
in
five
minutes
with
your
eyes
half
open
and
yourself
half
conscious
of
everything
that
is
passing
around
you
than
you
would
in
five
nights
with
your
eyes
fast
closed
and
your
senses
wrapt
in
perfect
unconsciousness
at
such
time
a
mortal
knows
just
enough
of
what
his
mind
is
doing
to
form
some
glimmering
conception
of
its
mighty
powers
its
bounding
from
earth
and
spurning
time
and
space
when
freed
from
the
restraint
of
its
corporeal
associate
oliver
was
precisely
in
this
condition
he
saw
the
jew
with
his
eyes
heard
his
low
whistling
and
recognised
the
sound
of
the
spoon
grating
against
the
saucepan
sides
and
yet
the
senses
were
mentally
engaged
at
the
same
time
in
busy
action
with
almost
everybody
he
had
ever
known
when
the
coffee
was
done
the
jew
drew
the
saucepan
to
the
hob
standing
then
in
an
irresolute
attitude
for
a
few
minutes
as
if
he
did
not
well
know
how
to
employ
himself
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
oliver
and
called
him
by
his
name
he
did
not
answer
and
was
to
all
appearances
asleep
after
satisfying
himself
upon
this
head
the
jew
stepped
gently
to
the
door
which
he
fastened
he
then
drew
forth
as
it
seemed
to
oliver
from
some
trap
in
the
floor
a
small
box
which
he
placed
carefully
on
the
table
his
eyes
glistened
as
he
raised
the
lid
and
looked
in
dragging
an
old
chair
to
the
table
he
sat
down
and
took
from
it
a
magnificent
gold
watch
sparkling
with
jewels
said
the
jew
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
and
distorting
every
feature
with
a
hideous
grin
dogs
clever
dogs
staunch
to
the
last
never
told
the
old
parson
where
they
were
never
poached
upon
old
fagin
and
why
should
they
it
would
have
loosened
the
knot
or
kept
the
drop
up
a
minute
longer
no
no
no
fine
fellows
fine
fellows
with
these
and
other
muttered
reflections
of
the
like
nature
the
jew
once
more
deposited
the
watch
in
its
place
of
safety
at
least
half
a
dozen
more
were
severally
drawn
forth
from
the
same
box
and
surveyed
with
equal
pleasure
besides
rings
brooches
bracelets
and
other
articles
of
jewellery
of
such
magnificent
materials
and
costly
workmanship
that
oliver
had
no
idea
even
of
their
names
having
replaced
these
trinkets
the
jew
took
out
another
so
small
that
it
lay
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
there
seemed
to
be
some
very
minute
inscription
on
it
for
the
jew
laid
it
flat
upon
the
table
and
shading
it
with
his
hand
pored
over
it
long
and
earnestly
at
length
he
put
it
down
as
if
despairing
of
success
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
muttered
a
fine
thing
capital
punishment
is
dead
men
never
repent
dead
men
never
bring
awkward
stories
to
light
ah
it
a
fine
thing
for
the
trade
five
of
strung
up
in
a
row
and
none
left
to
play
booty
or
turn
as
the
jew
uttered
these
words
his
bright
dark
eyes
which
had
been
staring
vacantly
before
him
fell
on
oliver
face
the
boy
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
in
mute
curiousity
and
although
the
recognition
was
only
for
an
instant
for
the
briefest
space
of
time
that
can
possibly
be
conceived
it
was
enough
to
show
the
old
man
that
he
had
been
observed
he
closed
the
lid
of
the
box
with
a
loud
crash
and
laying
his
hand
on
a
bread
knife
which
was
on
the
table
started
furiously
up
he
trembled
very
much
though
for
even
in
his
terror
oliver
could
see
that
the
knife
quivered
in
the
air
that
said
the
jew
do
you
watch
me
for
why
are
you
awake
what
have
you
seen
speak
out
boy
quick
quick
for
your
life
was
able
to
sleep
any
longer
sir
replied
oliver
meekly
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
disturbed
you
sir
were
not
awake
an
hour
ago
said
the
jew
scowling
fiercely
on
the
boy
no
indeed
replied
oliver
you
sure
cried
the
jew
with
a
still
fiercer
look
than
before
and
a
threatening
attitude
my
word
i
was
not
sir
replied
oliver
earnestly
was
not
indeed
sir
tush
my
dear
said
the
jew
abruptly
resuming
his
old
manner
and
playing
with
the
knife
a
little
before
he
laid
it
down
as
if
to
induce
the
belief
that
he
had
caught
it
up
in
mere
sport
course
i
know
that
my
dear
i
only
tried
to
frighten
you
you
a
brave
boy
ha
ha
you
a
brave
boy
oliver
the
jew
rubbed
his
hands
with
a
chuckle
but
glanced
uneasily
at
the
box
notwithstanding
you
see
any
of
these
pretty
things
my
dear
said
the
jew
laying
his
hand
upon
it
after
a
short
pause
sir
replied
oliver
said
the
jew
turning
rather
pale
they
mine
oliver
my
little
property
all
i
have
to
live
upon
in
my
old
age
the
folks
call
me
a
miser
my
dear
only
a
miser
that
all
oliver
thought
the
old
gentleman
must
be
a
decided
miser
to
live
in
such
a
dirty
place
with
so
many
watches
but
thinking
that
perhaps
his
fondness
for
the
dodger
and
the
other
boys
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
money
he
only
cast
a
deferential
look
at
the
jew
and
asked
if
he
might
get
up
my
dear
certainly
replied
the
old
gentleman
there
a
pitcher
of
water
in
the
corner
by
the
door
bring
it
here
and
i
give
you
a
basin
to
wash
in
my
dear
oliver
got
up
walked
across
the
room
and
stooped
for
an
instant
to
raise
the
pitcher
when
he
turned
his
head
the
box
was
gone
he
had
scarcely
washed
himself
and
made
everything
tidy
by
emptying
the
basin
out
of
the
window
agreeably
to
the
jew
directions
when
the
dodger
returned
accompanied
by
a
very
sprightly
young
friend
whom
oliver
had
seen
smoking
on
the
previous
night
and
who
was
now
formally
introduced
to
him
as
charley
bates
the
four
sat
down
to
breakfast
on
the
coffee
and
some
hot
rolls
and
ham
which
the
dodger
had
brought
home
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
said
the
jew
glancing
slyly
at
oliver
and
addressing
himself
to
the
dodger
hope
you
been
at
work
this
morning
my
dears
replied
the
dodger
nails
added
charley
bates
boys
good
boys
said
the
jew
have
you
got
dodger
couple
of
replied
that
young
gentlman
inquired
the
jew
with
eagerness
well
replied
the
dodger
producing
two
one
green
and
the
other
red
so
heavy
as
they
might
be
said
the
jew
after
looking
at
the
insides
carefully
very
neat
and
nicely
made
ingenious
workman
ai
he
oliver
indeed
sir
said
oliver
at
which
charles
bates
laughed
uproariously
very
much
to
the
amazement
of
oliver
who
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
anything
that
had
passed
what
have
you
got
my
dear
said
fagin
to
charley
bates
replied
master
bates
at
the
same
time
producing
four
said
the
jew
inspecting
them
closely
very
good
ones
very
you
have
marked
them
well
though
charley
so
the
marks
shall
be
picked
out
with
a
needle
and
we
teach
oliver
how
to
do
it
shall
us
oliver
eh
ha
ha
ha
you
please
sir
said
oliver
like
to
be
able
to
make
as
easy
as
charley
bates
would
you
my
dear
said
the
jew
much
indeed
if
you
teach
me
sir
replied
oliver
master
bates
saw
something
so
exquisitely
ludicrous
in
this
reply
that
he
burst
into
another
laugh
which
laugh
meeting
the
coffee
he
was
drinking
and
carrying
it
down
some
wrong
channel
very
nearly
terminated
in
his
premature
suffocation
is
so
jolly
green
said
charley
when
he
recovered
as
an
apology
to
the
company
for
his
unpolite
behaviour
the
dodger
said
nothing
but
he
smoothed
oliver
hair
over
his
eyes
and
said
he
know
better
by
and
by
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
observing
oliver
colour
mounting
changed
the
subject
by
asking
whether
there
had
been
much
of
a
crowd
at
the
execution
that
morning
this
made
him
wonder
more
and
more
for
it
was
plain
from
the
replies
of
the
two
boys
that
they
had
both
been
there
and
oliver
naturally
wondered
how
they
could
possibly
have
found
time
to
be
so
very
industrious
when
the
breakfast
was
cleared
away
the
merry
old
gentlman
and
the
two
boys
played
at
a
very
curious
and
uncommon
game
which
was
performed
in
this
way
the
merry
old
gentleman
placing
a
in
one
pocket
of
his
trousers
a
in
the
other
and
a
watch
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
with
a
round
his
neck
and
sticking
a
mock
diamond
pin
in
his
shirt
buttoned
his
coat
tight
round
him
and
putting
his
and
handkerchief
in
his
pockets
trotted
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
stick
in
imitation
of
the
manner
in
which
old
gentlemen
walk
about
the
streets
any
hour
in
the
day
sometimes
he
stopped
at
the
and
sometimes
at
the
door
making
believe
that
he
was
staring
with
all
his
might
into
at
such
times
he
would
look
constantly
round
him
for
fear
of
thieves
and
would
keep
slapping
all
his
pockets
in
turn
to
see
that
he
had
lost
anything
in
such
a
very
funny
and
natural
manner
that
oliver
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
all
this
time
the
two
boys
followed
him
closely
about
getting
out
of
his
sight
so
nimbly
every
time
he
turned
round
that
it
was
impossible
to
follow
their
motions
at
last
the
dodger
trod
upon
his
toes
or
ran
upon
his
boot
accidently
while
charley
bates
stumbled
up
against
him
behind
and
in
that
one
moment
they
took
from
him
with
the
most
extraordinary
rapidity
chain
even
the
if
the
old
gentlman
felt
a
hand
in
any
one
of
his
pockets
he
cried
out
where
it
was
and
then
the
game
began
all
over
again
when
this
game
had
been
played
a
great
many
times
a
couple
of
young
ladies
called
to
see
the
young
gentleman
one
of
whom
was
named
bet
and
the
other
nancy
they
wore
a
good
deal
of
hair
not
very
neatly
turned
up
behind
and
were
rather
untidy
about
the
shoes
and
stockings
they
were
not
exactly
pretty
perhaps
but
they
had
a
great
deal
of
colour
in
their
faces
and
looked
quite
stout
and
hearty
being
remarkably
free
and
agreeable
in
their
manners
oliver
thought
them
very
nice
girls
indeed
as
there
is
no
doubt
they
were
the
visitors
stopped
a
long
time
spirits
were
produced
in
consequence
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
complaining
of
a
coldness
in
her
inside
and
the
conversation
took
a
very
convivial
and
improving
turn
at
length
charley
bates
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
time
to
pad
the
hoof
this
it
occurred
to
oliver
must
be
french
for
going
out
for
directly
afterwards
the
dodger
and
charley
and
the
two
young
ladies
went
away
together
having
been
kindly
furnished
by
the
amiable
old
jew
with
money
to
spend
my
dear
said
fagin
a
pleasant
life
is
it
they
have
gone
out
for
the
day
they
done
work
sir
inquired
oliver
said
the
jew
is
unless
they
should
unexpectedly
come
across
any
when
they
are
out
and
they
wo
neglect
it
if
they
do
my
dear
depend
upon
it
make
your
models
my
dear
make
your
models
tapping
the
on
the
hearth
to
add
force
to
his
words
everything
they
bid
you
and
take
their
advice
in
all
matters
especially
the
dodger
my
dear
he
be
a
great
man
himself
and
will
make
you
one
too
if
you
take
pattern
by
is
my
handkerchief
hanging
out
of
my
pocket
my
dear
said
the
jew
stopping
short
sir
said
oliver
if
you
can
take
it
out
without
my
feeling
it
as
you
saw
them
do
when
we
were
at
play
this
morning
oliver
held
up
the
bottom
of
the
pocket
with
one
hand
as
he
had
seen
the
dodger
hold
it
and
drew
the
handkerchief
lightly
out
of
it
with
the
other
it
gone
cried
the
jew
it
is
sir
said
oliver
showing
it
in
his
hand
a
clever
boy
my
dear
said
the
playful
old
gentleman
patting
oliver
on
the
head
approvingly
never
saw
a
sharper
lad
here
a
shilling
for
you
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
you
be
the
greatest
man
of
the
time
and
now
come
here
and
i
show
you
how
to
take
the
marks
out
of
the
handkerchiefs
oliver
wondered
what
picking
the
old
gentleman
pocket
in
play
had
to
do
with
his
chances
of
being
a
great
man
but
thinking
that
the
jew
being
so
much
his
senior
must
know
best
he
followed
him
quietly
to
the
table
and
was
soon
deeply
involved
in
his
new
study
chapter
x
oliver
becomes
better
acquainted
with
the
characters
of
his
new
associates
and
purchases
experience
at
a
high
price
being
a
short
but
very
important
chapter
in
this
history
for
many
days
oliver
remained
in
the
jew
room
picking
the
marks
out
of
the
of
which
a
great
number
were
brought
home
and
sometimes
taking
part
in
the
game
already
described
which
the
two
boys
and
the
jew
played
regularly
every
morning
at
length
he
began
to
languish
for
fresh
air
and
took
many
occasions
of
earnestly
entreating
the
old
gentleman
to
allow
him
to
go
out
to
work
with
his
two
companions
oliver
was
rendered
the
more
anxious
to
be
actively
employed
by
what
he
had
seen
of
the
stern
morality
of
the
old
gentleman
character
whenever
the
dodger
or
charley
bates
came
home
at
night
he
would
expatiate
with
great
vehemence
on
the
misery
of
idle
and
lazy
habits
and
would
enforce
upon
them
the
necessity
of
an
active
life
by
sending
them
supperless
to
bed
on
one
occasion
indeed
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
knock
them
both
down
a
flight
of
stairs
but
this
was
carrying
out
his
virtuous
precepts
to
an
unusual
extent
at
length
one
morning
oliver
obtained
the
permission
he
had
so
eagerly
sought
there
had
been
no
handkerchiefs
to
work
upon
for
two
or
three
days
and
the
dinners
had
been
rather
meagre
perhaps
these
were
reasons
for
the
old
gentleman
giving
his
assent
but
whether
they
were
or
no
he
told
oliver
he
might
go
and
placed
him
under
the
joint
guardianship
of
charley
bates
and
his
friend
the
dodger
the
three
boys
sallied
out
the
dodger
with
his
tucked
up
and
his
hat
cocked
as
usual
master
bates
sauntering
along
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
oliver
between
them
wondering
where
they
were
going
and
what
branch
of
manufacture
he
would
be
instructed
in
first
the
pace
at
which
they
went
was
such
a
very
lazy
saunter
that
oliver
soon
began
to
think
his
companions
were
going
to
deceive
the
old
gentleman
by
not
going
to
work
at
all
the
dodger
had
a
vicious
propensity
too
of
pulling
the
caps
from
the
heads
of
small
boys
and
tossing
them
down
areas
while
charley
bates
exhibited
some
very
loose
notions
concerning
the
rights
of
property
by
pilfering
divers
apples
and
onions
from
the
stalls
at
the
kennel
sides
and
thrusting
them
into
pockets
which
were
so
surprisingly
capacious
that
they
seemed
to
undermine
his
whole
suit
of
clothes
in
every
direction
these
things
looked
so
bad
that
oliver
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
his
intention
of
seeking
his
way
back
in
the
best
way
he
could
when
his
thoughts
were
suddenly
directed
into
another
channel
by
a
very
mysterious
change
of
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
dodger
they
were
just
emerging
from
a
narrow
court
not
far
from
the
open
square
in
clerkenwell
which
is
yet
called
by
some
strange
perversion
of
terms
green
when
the
dodger
made
a
sudden
stop
and
laying
his
finger
on
his
lip
drew
his
companions
back
again
with
the
greatest
caution
and
circumspection
the
matter
demanded
oliver
replied
the
dodger
you
see
that
old
cove
at
the
old
gentleman
over
the
way
said
oliver
i
see
him
do
said
the
dodger
prime
plant
observed
master
charley
bates
oliver
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
the
greatest
surprise
but
he
was
not
permitted
to
make
any
inquiries
for
the
two
boys
walked
stealthily
across
the
road
and
slunk
close
behind
the
old
gentleman
towards
whom
his
attention
had
been
directed
oliver
walked
a
few
paces
after
them
and
not
knowing
whether
to
advance
or
retire
stood
looking
on
in
silent
amazement
the
old
gentleman
was
a
very
personage
with
a
powdered
head
and
gold
spectacles
he
was
dressed
in
a
coat
with
a
black
velvet
collar
wore
white
trousers
and
carried
a
smart
bamboo
cane
under
his
arm
he
had
taken
up
a
book
from
the
stall
and
there
he
stood
reading
away
as
hard
as
if
he
were
in
his
in
his
own
study
it
is
very
possible
that
he
fancied
himself
there
indeed
for
it
was
plain
from
his
abstraction
that
he
saw
not
the
nor
the
street
nor
the
boys
nor
in
short
anything
but
the
book
itself
which
he
was
reading
straight
through
turning
over
the
leaf
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
a
page
beginning
at
the
top
line
of
the
next
one
and
going
regularly
on
with
the
greatest
interest
and
eagerness
what
was
oliver
horror
and
alarm
as
he
stood
a
few
paces
off
looking
on
with
his
eyelids
as
wide
open
as
they
would
possibly
go
to
see
the
dodger
plunge
his
hand
into
the
old
gentleman
pocket
and
draw
from
thence
a
handkerchief
to
see
him
hand
the
same
to
charley
bates
and
finally
to
behold
them
both
running
away
round
the
corner
at
full
speed
in
an
instant
the
whole
mystery
of
the
hankerchiefs
and
the
watches
and
the
jewels
and
the
jew
rushed
upon
the
boy
mind
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
the
blood
so
tingling
through
all
his
veins
from
terror
that
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
burning
fire
then
confused
and
frightened
he
took
to
his
heels
and
not
knowing
what
he
did
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
lay
his
feet
to
the
ground
this
was
all
done
in
a
minute
space
in
the
very
instant
when
oliver
began
to
run
the
old
gentleman
putting
his
hand
to
his
pocket
and
missing
his
handkerchief
turned
sharp
round
seeing
the
boy
scudding
away
at
such
a
rapid
pace
he
very
naturally
concluded
him
to
be
the
depredator
and
shouting
thief
with
all
his
might
made
off
after
him
book
in
hand
but
the
old
gentleman
was
not
the
only
person
who
raised
the
the
dodger
and
master
bates
unwilling
to
attract
public
attention
by
running
down
the
open
street
had
merely
retired
into
the
very
first
doorway
round
the
corner
they
no
sooner
heard
the
cry
and
saw
oliver
running
than
guessing
exactly
how
the
matter
stood
they
issued
forth
with
great
promptitude
and
shouting
thief
too
joined
in
the
pursuit
like
good
citizens
although
oliver
had
been
brought
up
by
philosophers
he
was
not
theoretically
acquainted
with
the
beautiful
axiom
that
is
the
first
law
of
nature
if
he
had
been
perhaps
he
would
have
been
prepared
for
this
not
being
prepared
however
it
alarmed
him
the
more
so
away
he
went
like
the
wind
with
the
old
gentleman
and
the
two
boys
roaring
and
shouting
behind
him
thief
stop
thief
there
is
a
magic
in
the
sound
the
tradesman
leaves
his
counter
and
the
his
waggon
the
butcher
throws
down
his
tray
the
baker
his
basket
the
milkman
his
pail
the
his
parcels
the
his
marbles
the
paviour
his
pickaxe
the
child
his
battledore
away
they
run
tearing
yelling
screaming
knocking
down
the
passengers
as
they
turn
the
corners
rousing
up
the
dogs
and
astonishing
the
fowls
and
streets
squares
and
courts
with
the
sound
thief
stop
thief
the
cry
is
taken
up
by
a
hundred
voices
and
the
crowd
accumulate
at
every
turning
away
they
fly
splashing
through
the
mud
and
rattling
along
the
pavements
up
go
the
windows
out
run
the
people
onward
bear
the
mob
a
whole
audience
desert
punch
in
the
very
thickest
of
the
plot
and
joining
the
rushing
throng
swell
the
shout
and
lend
fresh
vigour
to
the
cry
thief
stop
thief
thief
stop
thief
there
is
a
passion
for
deeply
implanted
in
the
human
breast
one
wretched
breathless
child
panting
with
exhaustion
terror
in
his
looks
agony
in
his
eyes
large
drops
of
perspiration
streaming
down
his
face
strains
every
nerve
to
make
head
upon
his
pursuers
and
as
they
follow
on
his
track
and
gain
upon
him
every
instant
they
hail
his
decreasing
strength
with
joy
thief
ay
stop
him
for
god
sake
were
it
only
in
mercy
stopped
at
last
a
clever
blow
he
is
down
upon
the
pavement
and
the
crowd
eagerly
gather
round
him
each
new
comer
jostling
and
struggling
with
the
others
to
catch
a
glimpse
aside
him
a
little
air
he
do
deserve
it
the
gentleman
his
is
coming
down
the
street
room
there
for
the
gentleman
this
the
boy
sir
oliver
lay
covered
with
mud
and
dust
and
bleeding
from
the
mouth
looking
wildly
round
upon
the
heap
of
faces
that
surrounded
him
when
the
old
gentleman
was
officiously
dragged
and
pushed
into
the
circle
by
the
foremost
of
the
pursuers
said
the
gentleman
am
afraid
it
is
the
boy
murmured
the
crowd
a
good
fellow
said
the
gentleman
has
hurt
himself
did
that
sir
said
a
great
lubberly
fellow
stepping
forward
preciously
i
cut
my
knuckle
agin
his
mouth
i
stopped
him
sir
the
fellow
touched
his
hat
with
a
grin
expecting
something
for
his
pains
but
the
old
gentleman
eyeing
him
with
an
expression
of
dislike
look
anxiously
round
as
if
he
contemplated
running
away
himself
which
it
is
very
possible
he
might
have
attempted
to
do
and
thus
have
afforded
another
chase
had
not
a
police
officer
who
is
generally
the
last
person
to
arrive
in
such
cases
at
that
moment
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
seized
oliver
by
the
collar
get
up
said
the
man
roughly
was
me
indeed
sir
indeed
indeed
it
was
two
other
boys
said
oliver
clasping
his
hands
passionately
and
looking
round
are
here
somewhere
no
they
ai
said
the
officer
he
meant
this
to
be
ironical
but
it
was
true
besides
for
the
dodger
and
charley
bates
had
filed
off
down
the
first
convenient
court
they
came
to
get
up
hurt
him
said
the
old
gentleman
compassionately
no
i
wo
hurt
him
replied
the
officer
tearing
his
jacket
half
off
his
back
in
proof
thereof
i
know
you
it
wo
do
will
you
stand
upon
your
legs
you
young
devil
oliver
who
could
hardly
stand
made
a
shift
to
raise
himself
on
his
feet
and
was
at
once
lugged
along
the
streets
by
the
at
a
rapid
pace
the
gentleman
walked
on
with
them
by
the
officer
side
and
as
many
of
the
crowd
as
could
achieve
the
feat
got
a
little
ahead
and
stared
back
at
oliver
from
time
to
time
the
boys
shouted
in
triumph
and
on
they
went
chapter
xi
treats
of
fang
the
police
magistrate
and
furnishes
a
slight
specimen
of
his
mode
of
administering
justice
the
offence
had
been
committed
within
the
district
and
indeed
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
a
very
notorious
metropolitan
police
office
the
crowd
had
only
the
satisfaction
of
accompanying
oliver
through
two
or
three
streets
and
down
a
place
called
mutton
hill
when
he
was
led
beneath
a
low
archway
and
up
a
dirty
court
into
this
dispensary
of
summary
justice
by
the
back
way
it
was
a
small
paved
yard
into
which
they
turned
and
here
they
encountered
a
stout
man
with
a
bunch
of
whiskers
on
his
face
and
a
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
the
matter
now
said
the
man
carelessly
young
replied
the
man
who
had
oliver
in
charge
you
the
party
that
been
robbed
sir
inquired
the
man
with
the
keys
i
am
replied
the
old
gentleman
i
am
not
sure
that
this
boy
actually
took
the
handkerchief
i
i
would
rather
not
press
the
case
go
before
the
magistrate
now
sir
replied
the
man
worship
will
be
disengaged
in
half
a
minute
now
young
gallows
this
was
an
invitation
for
oliver
to
enter
through
a
door
which
he
unlocked
as
he
spoke
and
which
led
into
a
stone
cell
here
he
was
searched
and
nothing
being
found
upon
him
locked
up
this
cell
was
in
shape
and
size
something
like
an
area
cellar
only
not
so
light
it
was
most
intolerably
dirty
for
it
was
monday
morning
and
it
had
been
tenanted
by
six
drunken
people
who
had
been
locked
up
elsewhere
since
saturday
night
but
this
is
little
in
our
men
and
women
are
every
night
confined
on
the
most
trivial
charges
the
word
is
worth
noting
in
dungeons
compared
with
which
those
in
newgate
occupied
by
the
most
atrocious
felons
tried
found
guilty
and
under
sentence
of
death
are
palaces
let
any
one
who
doubts
this
compare
the
two
the
old
gentleman
looked
almost
as
rueful
as
oliver
when
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
he
turned
with
a
sigh
to
the
book
which
had
been
the
innocent
cause
of
all
this
disturbance
is
something
in
that
boy
face
said
the
old
gentleman
to
himself
as
he
walked
slowly
away
tapping
his
chin
with
the
cover
of
the
book
in
a
thoughtful
manner
that
touches
and
interests
me
he
be
innocent
he
looked
like
bye
the
bye
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
halting
very
abruptly
and
staring
up
into
the
sky
my
soul
where
have
i
seen
something
like
that
look
before
after
musing
for
some
minutes
the
old
gentleman
walked
with
the
same
meditative
face
into
a
back
anteroom
opening
from
the
yard
and
there
retiring
into
a
corner
called
up
before
his
mind
eye
a
vast
amphitheatre
of
faces
over
which
a
dusky
curtain
had
hung
for
many
years
said
the
old
gentleman
shaking
his
head
must
be
imagination
he
wandered
over
them
again
he
had
called
them
into
view
and
it
was
not
easy
to
replace
the
shroud
that
had
so
long
concealed
them
there
were
the
faces
of
friends
and
foes
and
of
many
that
had
been
almost
strangers
peering
intrusively
from
the
crowd
there
were
the
faces
of
young
and
blooming
girls
that
were
now
old
women
there
were
faces
that
the
grave
had
changed
and
closed
upon
but
which
the
mind
superior
to
its
power
still
dressed
in
their
old
freshness
and
beauty
calling
back
the
lustre
of
the
eyes
the
brightness
of
the
smile
the
beaming
of
the
soul
through
its
mask
of
clay
and
whispering
of
beauty
beyond
the
tomb
changed
but
to
be
heightened
and
taken
from
earth
only
to
be
set
up
as
a
light
to
shed
a
soft
and
gentle
glow
upon
the
path
to
heaven
but
the
old
gentleman
could
recall
no
one
countenance
of
which
features
bore
a
trace
so
he
heaved
a
sigh
over
the
recollections
he
awakened
and
being
happily
for
himself
an
absent
old
gentleman
buried
them
again
in
the
pages
of
the
musty
book
he
was
roused
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
and
a
request
from
the
man
with
the
keys
to
follow
him
into
the
office
he
closed
his
book
hastily
and
was
at
once
ushered
into
the
imposing
presence
of
the
renowned
fang
the
office
was
a
front
parlour
with
a
panelled
wall
fang
sat
behind
a
bar
at
the
upper
end
and
on
one
side
the
door
was
a
sort
of
wooden
pen
in
which
poor
little
oliver
was
already
deposited
trembling
very
much
at
the
awfulness
of
the
scene
fang
was
a
lean
man
with
no
great
quantity
of
hair
and
what
he
had
growing
on
the
back
and
sides
of
his
head
his
face
was
stern
and
much
flushed
if
he
were
really
not
in
the
habit
of
drinking
rather
more
than
was
exactly
good
for
him
he
might
have
brought
action
against
his
countenance
for
libel
and
have
recovered
heavy
damages
the
old
gentleman
bowed
respectfully
and
advancing
to
the
desk
said
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
is
my
name
and
address
sir
he
then
withdrew
a
pace
or
two
and
with
another
polite
and
gentlemanly
inclination
of
the
head
waited
to
be
questioned
now
it
so
happened
that
fang
was
at
that
moment
perusing
a
leading
article
in
a
newspaper
of
the
morning
adverting
to
some
recent
decision
of
his
and
commending
him
for
the
three
hundred
and
fiftieth
time
to
the
special
and
particular
notice
of
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
home
department
he
was
out
of
temper
and
he
looked
up
with
an
angry
scowl
are
you
said
fang
the
old
gentleman
pointed
with
some
surprise
to
his
card
said
fang
tossing
the
card
contemptuously
away
with
the
newspaper
is
this
fellow
name
sir
said
the
old
gentleman
speaking
a
gentleman
name
sir
is
brownlow
permit
me
to
inquire
the
name
of
the
magistrate
who
offers
a
gratuitous
and
unprovoked
insult
to
a
respectable
person
under
the
protection
of
the
bench
saying
this
brownlow
looked
around
the
office
as
if
in
search
of
some
person
who
would
afford
him
the
required
information
said
fang
throwing
the
paper
on
one
side
this
fellow
charged
with
not
charged
at
all
your
worship
replied
the
officer
appears
against
this
boy
your
worship
his
worship
knew
this
perfectly
well
but
it
was
a
good
annoyance
and
a
safe
one
against
the
boy
does
he
said
fang
surveying
brownlow
contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
him
i
am
sworn
i
must
beg
to
say
one
word
said
brownlow
that
is
that
i
really
never
without
actual
experience
could
have
believed
your
tongue
sir
said
fang
peremptorily
will
not
sir
replied
the
old
gentleman
your
tongue
this
instant
or
i
have
you
turned
out
of
the
office
said
fang
an
insolent
impertinent
fellow
how
dare
you
bully
a
magistrate
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
reddening
this
person
said
fang
to
the
clerk
not
hear
another
word
swear
him
brownlow
indignation
was
greatly
roused
but
reflecting
perhaps
that
he
might
only
injure
the
boy
by
giving
vent
to
it
he
suppressed
his
feelings
and
submitted
to
be
sworn
at
once
said
fang
the
charge
against
this
boy
what
have
you
got
to
say
sir
was
standing
at
a
bookstall
brownlow
began
your
tongue
sir
said
fang
where
the
policeman
here
swear
this
policeman
now
policeman
what
is
this
the
policeman
with
becoming
humility
related
how
he
had
taken
the
charge
how
he
had
searched
oliver
and
found
nothing
on
his
person
and
how
that
was
all
he
knew
about
it
there
any
witnesses
inquired
fang
your
worship
replied
the
policeman
fang
sat
silent
for
some
minutes
and
then
turning
round
to
the
prosecutor
said
in
a
towering
passion
you
mean
to
state
what
your
complaint
against
this
boy
is
man
or
do
you
not
you
have
been
sworn
now
if
you
stand
there
refusing
to
give
evidence
i
punish
you
for
disrespect
to
the
bench
i
will
by
by
what
or
by
whom
nobody
knows
for
the
clerk
and
jailor
coughed
very
loud
just
at
the
right
moment
and
the
former
dropped
a
heavy
book
upon
the
floor
thus
preventing
the
word
from
being
heard
accidently
of
course
with
many
interruptions
and
repeated
insults
brownlow
contrived
to
state
his
case
observing
that
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
he
had
run
after
the
boy
because
he
had
saw
him
running
away
and
expressing
his
hope
that
if
the
magistrate
should
believe
him
although
not
actually
the
thief
to
be
connected
with
the
thieves
he
would
deal
as
leniently
with
him
as
justice
would
allow
has
been
hurt
already
said
the
old
gentleman
in
conclusion
i
fear
he
added
with
great
energy
looking
towards
the
bar
really
fear
that
he
is
yes
i
dare
say
said
fang
with
a
sneer
none
of
your
tricks
here
you
young
vagabond
they
wo
do
what
your
name
oliver
tried
to
reply
but
his
tongue
failed
him
he
was
deadly
pale
and
the
whole
place
seemed
turning
round
and
round
your
name
you
hardened
scoundrel
demanded
fang
what
his
name
this
was
addressed
to
a
bluff
old
fellow
in
a
striped
waistcoat
who
was
standing
by
the
bar
he
bent
over
oliver
and
repeated
the
inquiry
but
finding
him
really
incapable
of
understanding
the
question
and
knowing
that
his
not
replying
would
only
infuriate
the
magistrate
the
more
and
add
to
the
severity
of
his
sentence
he
hazarded
a
guess
says
his
name
tom
white
your
worship
said
the
he
wo
speak
out
wo
he
said
fang
well
very
well
where
does
he
live
he
can
your
worship
replied
the
officer
again
pretending
to
receive
oliver
answer
he
any
parents
inquired
fang
says
they
died
in
his
infancy
your
worship
replied
the
officer
hazarding
the
usual
reply
at
this
point
of
the
inquiry
oliver
raised
his
head
and
looking
round
with
imploring
eyes
murmured
a
feeble
prayer
for
a
draught
of
water
and
nonsense
said
fang
try
to
make
a
fool
of
me
think
he
really
is
ill
your
worship
remonstrated
the
officer
know
better
said
fang
care
of
him
officer
said
the
old
gentleman
raising
his
hands
instinctively
fall
down
away
officer
cried
fang
him
if
he
likes
oliver
availed
himself
of
the
kind
permission
and
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
fainting
fit
the
men
in
the
office
looked
at
each
other
but
no
one
dared
to
stir
knew
he
was
shamming
said
fang
as
if
this
were
incontestable
proof
of
the
fact
him
lie
there
he
soon
be
tired
of
that
do
you
propose
to
deal
with
the
case
sir
inquired
the
clerk
in
a
low
voice
replied
fang
stands
committed
for
three
months
hard
labour
of
course
clear
the
office
the
door
was
opened
for
this
purpose
and
a
couple
of
men
were
preparing
to
carry
the
insensible
boy
to
his
cell
when
an
elderly
man
of
decent
but
poor
appearance
clad
in
an
old
suit
of
black
rushed
hastily
into
the
office
and
advanced
towards
the
bench
stop
do
take
him
away
for
heaven
sake
stop
a
moment
cried
the
new
comer
breathless
with
haste
although
the
presiding
genii
in
such
an
office
as
this
exercise
a
summary
and
arbitrary
power
over
the
liberties
the
good
name
the
character
almost
the
lives
of
her
majesty
subjects
expecially
of
the
poorer
class
and
although
within
such
walls
enough
fantastic
tricks
are
daily
played
to
make
the
angels
blind
with
weeping
they
are
closed
to
the
public
save
through
the
medium
of
the
daily
press
footnote
or
were
virtually
then
fang
was
consequently
not
a
little
indignant
to
see
an
unbidden
guest
enter
in
such
irreverent
disorder
is
this
who
is
this
turn
this
man
out
clear
the
office
cried
fang
speak
cried
the
man
will
not
be
turned
out
i
saw
it
all
i
keep
the
i
demand
to
be
sworn
i
will
not
be
put
down
fang
you
must
hear
me
you
must
not
refuse
sir
the
man
was
right
his
manner
was
determined
and
the
matter
was
growing
rather
too
serious
to
be
hushed
up
the
man
growled
fang
with
a
very
ill
grace
man
what
have
you
got
to
say
said
the
man
saw
three
boys
two
others
and
the
prisoner
here
loitering
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
when
this
gentleman
was
reading
the
robbery
was
committed
by
another
boy
i
saw
it
done
and
i
saw
that
this
boy
was
perfectly
amazed
and
stupified
by
it
having
by
this
time
recovered
a
little
breath
the
worthy
keeper
proceeded
to
relate
in
a
more
coherent
manner
the
exact
circumstances
of
the
robbery
did
you
come
here
before
said
fang
after
a
pause
had
a
soul
to
mind
the
shop
replied
the
man
who
could
have
helped
me
had
joined
in
the
pursuit
i
could
get
nobody
till
five
minutes
ago
and
i
run
here
all
the
way
prosecutor
was
reading
was
he
inquired
fang
after
another
pause
replied
the
man
very
book
he
has
in
his
hand
that
book
eh
said
fang
it
paid
for
it
is
not
replied
the
man
with
a
smile
me
i
forgot
all
about
it
exclaimed
the
absent
old
gentleman
innocently
nice
person
to
prefer
a
charge
against
a
poor
boy
said
fang
with
a
comical
effort
to
look
humane
consider
sir
that
you
have
obtained
possession
of
that
book
under
very
suspicious
and
disreputable
circumstances
and
you
may
think
yourself
very
fortunate
that
the
owner
of
the
property
declines
to
prosecute
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
man
or
the
law
will
overtake
you
yet
the
boy
is
discharged
clear
the
office
n
me
cried
the
old
gentleman
bursting
out
with
the
rage
he
had
kept
down
so
long
n
me
i
the
office
said
the
magistrate
do
you
hear
clear
the
office
the
mandate
was
obeyed
and
the
indignant
brownlow
was
conveyed
out
with
the
book
in
one
hand
and
the
bamboo
cane
in
the
other
in
a
perfect
phrenzy
of
rage
and
defiance
he
reached
the
yard
and
his
passion
vanished
in
a
moment
little
oliver
twist
lay
on
his
back
on
the
pavement
with
his
shirt
unbuttoned
and
his
temples
bathed
with
water
his
face
a
deadly
white
and
a
cold
tremble
convulsing
his
whole
frame
boy
poor
boy
said
brownlow
bending
over
him
a
coach
somebody
pray
directly
a
coach
was
obtained
and
oliver
having
been
carefully
laid
on
the
seat
the
old
gentleman
got
in
and
sat
himself
on
the
other
i
accompany
you
said
the
keeper
looking
in
me
yes
my
dear
sir
said
brownlow
quickly
forgot
you
dear
dear
i
have
this
unhappy
book
still
jump
in
poor
fellow
there
no
time
to
lose
the
keeper
got
into
the
coach
and
away
they
drove
chapter
xii
in
which
oliver
is
taken
better
care
of
than
he
ever
was
before
and
in
which
the
narrative
reverts
to
the
merry
old
gentleman
and
his
youthful
friends
the
coach
rattled
away
over
nearly
the
same
ground
as
that
which
oliver
had
traversed
when
he
first
entered
london
in
company
with
the
dodger
and
turning
a
different
way
when
it
reached
the
angel
at
islington
stopped
at
length
before
a
neat
house
in
a
quiet
shady
street
near
pentonville
here
a
bed
was
prepared
without
loss
of
time
in
which
brownlow
saw
his
young
charge
carefully
and
comfortably
deposited
and
here
he
was
tended
with
a
kindness
and
solicitude
that
knew
no
bounds
but
for
many
days
oliver
remained
insensible
to
all
the
goodness
of
his
new
friends
the
sun
rose
and
sank
and
rose
and
sank
again
and
many
times
after
that
and
still
the
boy
lay
stretched
on
his
uneasy
bed
dwindling
away
beneath
the
dry
and
wasting
heat
of
fever
the
worm
does
not
work
more
surely
on
the
dead
body
than
does
this
slow
creeping
fire
upon
the
living
frame
weak
and
thin
and
pallid
he
awoke
at
last
from
what
seemed
to
have
been
a
long
and
troubled
dream
feebly
raising
himself
in
the
bed
with
his
head
resting
on
his
trembling
arm
he
looked
anxiously
around
room
is
this
where
have
i
been
brought
to
said
oliver
is
not
the
place
i
went
to
sleep
in
he
uttered
these
words
in
a
feeble
voice
being
very
faint
and
weak
but
they
were
overheard
at
once
the
curtain
at
the
bed
head
was
hastily
drawn
back
and
a
motherly
old
lady
very
neatly
and
precisely
dressed
rose
as
she
undrew
it
from
an
close
by
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
at
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
softly
must
be
very
quiet
or
you
will
be
ill
again
and
you
have
been
very
bad
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
pretty
nigh
lie
down
again
there
a
dear
with
those
words
the
old
lady
very
gently
placed
oliver
head
upon
the
pillow
and
smoothing
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
looked
so
kindly
and
loving
in
his
face
that
he
could
not
help
placing
his
little
withered
hand
in
hers
and
drawing
it
round
his
neck
us
said
the
old
lady
with
tears
in
her
eyes
a
grateful
little
dear
it
is
pretty
creetur
what
would
his
mother
feel
if
she
had
sat
by
him
as
i
have
and
could
see
him
now
she
does
see
me
whispered
oliver
folding
his
hands
together
she
has
sat
by
me
i
almost
feel
as
if
she
had
was
the
fever
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
mildly
suppose
it
was
replied
oliver
heaven
is
a
long
way
off
and
they
are
too
happy
there
to
come
down
to
the
bedside
of
a
poor
boy
but
if
she
knew
i
was
ill
she
must
have
pitied
me
even
there
for
she
was
very
ill
herself
before
she
died
she
ca
know
anything
about
me
though
added
oliver
after
a
moment
silence
she
had
seen
me
hurt
it
would
have
made
her
sorrowful
and
her
face
has
always
looked
sweet
and
happy
when
i
have
dreamed
of
her
the
old
lady
made
no
reply
to
this
but
wiping
her
eyes
first
and
her
spectacles
which
lay
on
the
counterpane
afterwards
as
if
they
were
part
and
parcel
of
those
features
brought
some
cool
stuff
for
oliver
to
drink
and
then
patting
him
on
the
cheek
told
him
he
must
lie
very
quiet
or
he
would
be
ill
again
so
oliver
kept
very
still
partly
because
he
was
anxious
to
obey
the
kind
old
lady
in
all
things
and
partly
to
tell
the
truth
because
he
was
completely
exhausted
with
what
he
had
already
said
he
soon
fell
into
a
gentle
doze
from
which
he
was
awakened
by
the
light
of
a
candle
which
being
brought
near
the
bed
showed
him
a
gentleman
with
a
very
large
and
gold
watch
in
his
hand
who
felt
his
pulse
and
said
he
was
a
great
deal
better
a
great
deal
better
are
you
not
my
dear
said
the
gentleman
thank
you
sir
replied
oliver
i
know
you
are
said
the
gentleman
hungry
too
you
sir
answered
oliver
said
the
gentleman
i
know
you
not
he
is
not
hungry
bedwin
said
the
gentleman
looking
very
wise
the
old
lady
made
a
respectful
inclination
of
the
head
which
seemed
to
say
that
she
thought
the
doctor
was
a
very
clever
man
the
doctor
appeared
much
of
the
same
opinion
himself
feel
sleepy
do
you
my
dear
said
the
doctor
sir
replied
oliver
said
the
doctor
with
a
very
shrewd
and
satisfied
look
not
sleepy
nor
thirsty
are
you
sir
rather
thirsty
answered
oliver
as
i
expected
bedwin
said
the
doctor
very
natural
that
he
should
be
thirsty
you
may
give
him
a
little
tea
and
some
dry
toast
without
any
butter
do
keep
him
too
warm
but
be
careful
that
you
do
let
him
be
too
cold
will
you
have
the
goodness
the
old
lady
dropped
a
curtsey
the
doctor
after
tasting
the
cool
stuff
and
expressing
a
qualified
approval
of
it
hurried
away
his
boots
creaking
in
a
very
important
and
wealthy
manner
as
he
went
downstairs
oliver
dozed
off
again
soon
after
this
when
he
awoke
it
was
nearly
twelve
the
old
lady
tenderly
bade
him
shortly
afterwards
and
left
him
in
charge
of
a
fat
old
woman
who
had
just
come
bringing
with
her
in
a
little
bundle
a
small
prayer
book
and
a
large
nightcap
putting
the
latter
on
her
head
and
the
former
on
the
table
the
old
woman
after
telling
oliver
that
she
had
come
to
sit
up
with
him
drew
her
chair
close
to
the
fire
and
went
off
into
a
series
of
short
naps
chequered
at
frequent
intervals
with
sundry
tumblings
forward
and
divers
moans
and
chokings
these
however
had
no
worse
effect
than
causing
her
to
rub
her
nose
very
hard
and
then
fall
asleep
again
and
thus
the
night
crept
slowly
on
oliver
lay
awake
for
some
time
counting
the
little
circles
of
light
which
the
reflection
of
the
threw
upon
the
ceiling
or
tracing
with
his
languid
eyes
the
intricate
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
the
darkness
and
the
deep
stillness
of
the
room
were
very
solemn
as
they
brought
into
the
boy
mind
the
thought
that
death
had
been
hovering
there
for
many
days
and
nights
and
might
yet
fill
it
with
the
gloom
and
dread
of
his
awful
presence
he
turned
his
face
upon
the
pillow
and
fervently
prayed
to
heaven
gradually
he
fell
into
that
deep
tranquil
sleep
which
ease
from
recent
suffering
alone
imparts
that
calm
and
peaceful
rest
which
it
is
pain
to
wake
from
who
if
this
were
death
would
be
roused
again
to
all
the
struggles
and
turmoils
of
life
to
all
its
cares
for
the
present
its
anxieties
for
the
future
more
than
all
its
weary
recollections
of
the
past
it
had
been
bright
day
for
hours
when
oliver
opened
his
eyes
he
felt
cheerful
and
happy
the
crisis
of
the
disease
was
safely
past
he
belonged
to
the
world
again
in
three
days
time
he
was
able
to
sit
in
an
well
propped
up
with
pillows
and
as
he
was
still
too
weak
to
walk
bedwin
had
him
carried
downstairs
into
the
little
housekeeper
room
which
belonged
to
her
having
him
set
here
by
the
the
good
old
lady
sat
herself
down
too
and
being
in
a
state
of
considerable
delight
at
seeing
him
so
much
better
forthwith
began
to
cry
most
violently
mind
me
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
only
having
a
regular
good
cry
there
it
all
over
now
and
i
quite
comfortable
very
very
kind
to
me
said
oliver
never
you
mind
that
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
got
nothing
to
do
with
your
broth
and
it
full
time
you
had
it
for
the
doctor
says
brownlow
may
come
in
to
see
you
this
morning
and
we
must
get
up
our
best
looks
because
the
better
we
look
the
more
be
pleased
and
with
this
the
old
lady
applied
herself
to
warming
up
in
a
little
saucepan
a
basin
full
of
broth
strong
enough
oliver
thought
to
furnish
an
ample
dinner
when
reduced
to
the
regulation
strength
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
paupers
at
the
lowest
computation
you
fond
of
pictures
dear
inquired
the
old
lady
seeing
that
oliver
had
fixed
his
eyes
most
intently
on
a
portrait
which
hung
against
the
wall
just
opposite
his
chair
do
quite
know
said
oliver
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
canvas
have
seen
so
few
that
i
hardly
know
what
a
beautiful
mild
face
that
lady
is
said
the
old
lady
always
make
ladies
out
prettier
than
they
are
or
they
would
get
any
custom
child
the
man
that
invented
the
machine
for
taking
likenesses
might
have
known
that
would
never
succeed
it
a
deal
too
honest
a
deal
said
the
old
lady
laughing
very
heartily
at
her
own
acuteness
is
that
a
likeness
said
oliver
said
the
old
lady
looking
up
for
a
moment
from
the
broth
a
portrait
asked
oliver
really
my
dear
i
do
know
answered
the
old
lady
in
a
manner
not
a
likeness
of
anybody
that
you
or
i
know
i
expect
it
seems
to
strike
your
fancy
dear
is
so
pretty
replied
oliver
sure
you
not
afraid
of
it
said
the
old
lady
observing
in
great
surprise
the
look
of
awe
with
which
the
child
regarded
the
painting
no
no
returned
oliver
quickly
the
eyes
look
so
sorrowful
and
where
i
sit
they
seem
fixed
upon
me
it
makes
my
heart
beat
added
oliver
in
a
low
voice
if
it
was
alive
and
wanted
to
speak
to
me
but
could
save
us
exclaimed
the
old
lady
starting
talk
in
that
way
child
you
weak
and
nervous
after
your
illness
let
me
wheel
your
chair
round
to
the
other
side
and
then
you
wo
see
it
there
said
the
old
lady
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
do
see
it
now
at
all
events
oliver
see
it
in
his
mind
eye
as
distinctly
as
if
he
had
not
altered
his
position
but
he
thought
it
better
not
to
worry
the
kind
old
lady
so
he
smiled
gently
when
she
looked
at
him
and
bedwin
satisfied
that
he
felt
more
comfortable
salted
and
broke
bits
of
toasted
bread
into
the
broth
with
all
the
bustle
befitting
so
solemn
a
preparation
oliver
got
through
it
with
extraordinary
expedition
he
had
scarcely
swallowed
the
last
spoonful
when
there
came
a
soft
rap
at
the
door
in
said
the
old
lady
and
in
walked
brownlow
now
the
old
gentleman
came
in
as
brisk
as
need
be
but
he
had
no
sooner
raised
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
and
thrust
his
hands
behind
the
skirts
of
his
to
take
a
good
long
look
at
oliver
than
his
countenance
underwent
a
very
great
variety
of
odd
contortions
oliver
looked
very
worn
and
shadowy
from
sickness
and
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
stand
up
out
of
respect
to
his
benefactor
which
terminated
in
his
sinking
back
into
the
chair
again
and
the
fact
is
if
the
truth
must
be
told
that
brownlow
heart
being
large
enough
for
any
six
ordinary
old
gentlemen
of
humane
disposition
forced
a
supply
of
tears
into
his
eyes
by
some
hydraulic
process
which
we
are
not
sufficiently
philosophical
to
be
in
a
condition
to
explain
boy
poor
boy
said
brownlow
clearing
his
throat
rather
hoarse
this
morning
bedwin
i
afraid
i
have
caught
cold
hope
not
sir
said
bedwin
you
have
had
has
been
well
aired
sir
do
know
bedwin
i
do
know
said
brownlow
rather
think
i
had
a
damp
napkin
at
yesterday
but
never
mind
that
how
do
you
feel
my
dear
happy
sir
replied
oliver
very
grateful
indeed
sir
for
your
goodness
to
me
by
said
brownlow
stoutly
you
given
him
any
nourishment
bedwin
any
slops
eh
has
just
had
a
basin
of
beautiful
strong
broth
sir
replied
bedwin
drawing
herself
up
slightly
and
laying
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
to
intimate
that
between
slops
and
broth
will
compounded
there
existed
no
affinity
or
connection
whatsoever
said
brownlow
with
a
slight
shudder
couple
of
glasses
of
port
wine
would
have
done
him
a
great
deal
more
good
would
they
tom
white
eh
name
is
oliver
sir
replied
the
little
invalid
with
a
look
of
great
astonishment
said
brownlow
what
oliver
white
eh
sir
twist
oliver
twist
name
said
the
old
gentleman
made
you
tell
the
magistrate
your
name
was
white
never
told
him
so
sir
returned
oliver
in
amazement
this
sounded
so
like
a
falsehood
that
the
old
gentleman
looked
somewhat
sternly
in
oliver
face
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
him
there
was
truth
in
every
one
of
its
thin
and
sharpened
lineaments
mistake
said
brownlow
but
although
his
motive
for
looking
steadily
at
oliver
no
longer
existed
the
old
idea
of
the
resemblance
between
his
features
and
some
familiar
face
came
upon
him
so
strongly
that
he
could
not
withdraw
his
gaze
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
me
sir
said
oliver
raising
his
eyes
beseechingly
no
replied
the
old
gentleman
what
this
bedwin
look
there
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
hastily
to
the
picture
over
oliver
head
and
then
to
the
boy
face
there
was
its
living
copy
the
eyes
the
head
the
mouth
every
feature
was
the
same
the
expression
was
for
the
instant
so
precisely
alike
that
the
minutest
line
seemed
copied
with
startling
accuracy
oliver
knew
not
the
cause
of
this
sudden
exclamation
for
not
being
strong
enough
to
bear
the
start
it
gave
him
he
fainted
away
a
weakness
on
his
part
which
affords
the
narrative
an
opportunity
of
relieving
the
reader
from
suspense
in
behalf
of
the
two
young
pupils
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
and
of
recording
that
when
the
dodger
and
his
accomplished
friend
master
bates
joined
in
the
which
was
raised
at
oliver
heels
in
consequence
of
their
executing
an
illegal
conveyance
of
brownlow
personal
property
as
has
been
already
described
they
were
actuated
by
a
very
laudable
and
becoming
regard
for
themselves
and
forasmuch
as
the
freedom
of
the
subject
and
the
liberty
of
the
individual
are
among
the
first
and
proudest
boasts
of
a
englishman
so
i
need
hardly
beg
the
reader
to
observe
that
this
action
should
tend
to
exalt
them
in
the
opinion
of
all
public
and
patriotic
men
in
almost
as
great
a
degree
as
this
strong
proof
of
their
anxiety
for
their
own
preservation
and
safety
goes
to
corroborate
and
confirm
the
little
code
of
laws
which
certain
profound
and
philosophers
have
laid
down
as
the
of
all
nature
deeds
and
actions
the
said
philosophers
very
wisely
reducing
the
good
lady
proceedings
to
matters
of
maxim
and
theory
and
by
a
very
neat
and
pretty
compliment
to
her
exalted
wisdom
and
understanding
putting
entirely
out
of
sight
any
considerations
of
heart
or
generous
impulse
and
feeling
for
these
are
matters
totally
beneath
a
female
who
is
acknowledged
by
universal
admission
to
be
far
above
the
numerous
little
foibles
and
weaknesses
of
her
sex
if
i
wanted
any
further
proof
of
the
strictly
philosophical
nature
of
the
conduct
of
these
young
gentlemen
in
their
very
delicate
predicament
i
should
at
once
find
it
in
the
fact
also
recorded
in
a
foregoing
part
of
this
narrative
of
their
quitting
the
pursuit
when
the
general
attention
was
fixed
upon
oliver
and
making
immediately
for
their
home
by
the
shortest
possible
cut
although
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
it
is
usually
the
practice
of
renowned
and
learned
sages
to
shorten
the
road
to
any
great
conclusion
their
course
indeed
being
rather
to
lengthen
the
distance
by
various
circumlocutions
and
discursive
staggerings
like
unto
those
in
which
drunken
men
under
the
pressure
of
a
too
mighty
flow
of
ideas
are
prone
to
indulge
still
i
do
mean
to
say
and
do
say
distinctly
that
it
is
the
invariable
practice
of
many
mighty
philosophers
in
carrying
out
their
theories
to
evince
great
wisdom
and
foresight
in
providing
against
every
possible
contingency
which
can
be
supposed
at
all
likely
to
affect
themselves
thus
to
do
a
great
right
you
may
do
a
little
wrong
and
you
may
take
any
means
which
the
end
to
be
attained
will
justify
the
amount
of
the
right
or
the
amount
of
the
wrong
or
indeed
the
distinction
between
the
two
being
left
entirely
to
the
philosopher
concerned
to
be
settled
and
determined
by
his
clear
comprehensive
and
impartial
view
of
his
own
particular
case
it
was
not
until
the
two
boys
had
scoured
with
great
rapidity
through
a
most
intricate
maze
of
narrow
streets
and
courts
that
they
ventured
to
halt
beneath
a
low
and
dark
archway
having
remained
silent
here
just
long
enough
to
recover
breath
to
speak
master
bates
uttered
an
exclamation
of
amusement
and
delight
and
bursting
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
flung
himself
upon
a
doorstep
and
rolled
thereon
in
a
transport
of
mirth
the
matter
inquired
the
dodger
ha
ha
roared
charley
bates
your
noise
remonstrated
the
dodger
looking
cautiously
round
you
want
to
be
grabbed
stupid
ca
help
it
said
charley
ca
help
it
to
see
him
splitting
away
at
that
pace
and
cutting
round
the
corners
and
knocking
up
again
the
posts
and
starting
on
again
as
if
he
was
made
of
iron
as
well
as
them
and
me
with
the
wipe
in
my
pocket
singing
out
arter
him
oh
my
eye
the
vivid
imagination
of
master
bates
presented
the
scene
before
him
in
too
strong
colours
as
he
arrived
at
this
apostrophe
he
again
rolled
upon
the
and
laughed
louder
than
before
fagin
say
inquired
the
dodger
taking
advantage
of
the
next
interval
of
breathlessness
on
the
part
of
his
friend
to
propound
the
question
repeated
charley
bates
what
said
the
dodger
what
should
he
say
inquired
charley
stopping
rather
suddenly
in
his
merriment
for
the
dodger
manner
was
impressive
should
he
say
dawkins
whistled
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
taking
off
his
hat
scratched
his
head
and
nodded
thrice
do
you
mean
said
charley
rul
lol
loo
gammon
and
spinnage
the
frog
he
would
and
high
cockolorum
said
the
dodger
with
a
slight
sneer
on
his
intellectual
countenance
this
was
explanatory
but
not
satisfactory
master
bates
felt
it
so
and
again
said
do
you
mean
the
dodger
made
no
reply
but
putting
his
hat
on
again
and
gathering
the
skirts
of
his
coat
under
his
arm
thrust
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
slapped
the
bridge
of
his
nose
some
times
in
a
familiar
but
expressive
manner
and
turning
on
his
heel
slunk
down
the
court
master
bates
followed
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
the
noise
of
footsteps
on
the
creaking
stairs
a
few
minutes
after
the
occurrence
of
this
conversation
roused
the
merry
old
gentleman
as
he
sat
over
the
fire
with
a
saveloy
and
a
small
loaf
in
his
hand
a
in
his
right
and
a
pewter
pot
on
the
trivet
there
was
a
rascally
smile
on
his
white
face
as
he
turned
round
and
looking
sharply
out
from
under
his
thick
red
eyebrows
bent
his
ear
towards
the
door
and
listened
how
this
muttered
the
jew
changing
countenance
two
of
where
the
third
they
ca
have
got
into
trouble
hark
the
footsteps
approached
nearer
they
reached
the
landing
the
door
was
slowly
opened
and
the
dodger
and
charley
bates
entered

said
the
jew
rising
with
a
menacing
look
the
boy
the
young
thieves
eyed
their
preceptor
as
if
they
were
alarmed
at
his
violence

looked
uneasily
at

they
made
no

of
the

the

seizing
the
dodger
tightly
by
the
collar
and
threatening
him
with
horrid
imprecations
out
or
i
throttle
you
fagin
looked
so
very
much
in
earnest
that
charley
bates
who
deemed
it
prudent
in
all
cases
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
who
conceived
it
by
no

improbable
that
it
might
be
his
turn
to
be
throttled

dropped
upon
his
knees
and
raised
a
loud
and
continuous
roar
something
between
a
mad
bull
and
a
speaking
trumpet
you
speak
thundered
the
jew
shaking
the
dodger
so
much
that
his
keeping
in
the
big
coat
at
all
seemed
perfectly
miraculous
the
traps
have
got
him
and
that
all
about
it
said
the
dodger
sullenly
let
go
o
me
will
you
and
swinging
himself
at
one
jerk
clean
out
of
the
big
coat
which
he
left
in
the
jew
hands
the
dodger
snatched
up
the
toasting
fork
and
made
a
pass
at
the
merry
old
gentleman
waistcoat
which
if
it
had
taken
effect
would
have
let
a
little
more
merriment
out
than
could
have
been
easily
replaced
the
jew
stepped
back
in
this
emergency
with
more
agility
than
could
have
been
anticipated
in
a
man
of
his
apparent
decrepitude
and
seizing
up
the
pot
prepared
to
hurl
it
at
his
assailant
head
but
charley
bates
at
this
moment
calling
his
attention
by
a
perfectly
terrific
howl
he
suddenly
altered
its
destination
and
flung
it
full
at
that
young
gentleman
what
the
blazes
is
in
the
wind
now
growled
a
deep
voice
pitched
that
at
me
it
well
it
the
beer
and
not
the
pot
as
hit
me
or
i
have
settled
somebody
i
might
have
know
as
nobody
but
an
infernal
rich
plundering
thundering
old
jew
could
afford
to
throw
away
any
drink
but
water
and
not
that
unless
he
done
the
river
company
every
quarter
wot
it
all
about

if
my
a
lined
with

come
in

sneaking
warmint
wot
are
you
stopping
outside
for
as
if
you
was
ashamed
of
your
master
come
in
the
man
who
growled
out
these
words
was
a
fellow
of
about
in
a
black
velveteen
coat
very
soiled
drab
breeches
half
boots
and
grey
cotton
stockings
which
inclosed
a
bulky
pair
of
legs
with
large
swelling
calves
the
kind
of
legs
which
in
such
costume
always
look
in
an
unfinished
and
incomplete
state
without
a
set
of
fetters
to
garnish
them
he
had
a
brown
hat
on
his
head
and
a
dirty
belcher
handkerchief
round
his
neck
with
the
long
frayed
ends
of
which
he
smeared
the
beer
from
his
face
as
he
spoke
he
disclosed
when
he
had
done
so
a
broad
heavy
countenance
with
a
beard
of
three
days
growth
and
two
scowling
eyes
one
of
which
displayed
various
symptoms
of
having
been
recently
damaged
by
a
blow
in
d
hear
growled
this
engaging
ruffian
a
white
shaggy
dog
with
his
face
scratched
and
torn
in
twenty
different
places
skulked
into
the
room
did
you
come
in
afore
said
the
man
getting
too
proud
to
own
me
afore
company
are
you
lie
down
this
command
was
accompanied
with
a
kick
which
sent
the
animal
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
appeared
well
used
to
it
however
for
he
coiled
himself
up
in
a
corner
very
quietly
without
uttering
a
sound
and
winking
his
very
eyes
twenty
times
in
a
minute
appeared
to
occupy
himself
in
taking
a
survey
of
the
apartment
are
you
up
to
the

you
covetous
avaricious
old

said
the

seating
himself
deliberately

keeping
as
a
curiousity
of
ugliness
in
a
glass
bottle
and
i
suppose
they
do
blow
glass
bottles
large
enough

said
the
jew
trembling
speak
so
loud
of
your
mistering
replied
the
ruffian
always
mean
mischief
when
you
come
that
you
know
my
name
out
with
it
i
disgrace
it
when
the
time
comes
well
then
bill
sikes
said
the
jew
with
abject
humility
seem
out
of
humour
bill
i
am
replied
sikes
should
think
you
was
rather
out
of
sorts
too
unless
you
mean
as
little
harm
when
you
throw
pewter
pots
about
as
you
do
when
you
blab
and
you
mad
said
the
jew
catching
the
man
by
the
sleeve
and
pointing
towards
the
boys
sikes
contented
himself
with
tying
an
imaginary
knot
under
his
left
ear
and
jerking
his
head
over
on
the
right
shoulder
a
piece
of
dumb
show
which
the
jew
appeared
to
understand
perfectly
he
then
in
cant
terms
with
which
his
whole
conversation
was
plentifully
besprinkled
but
which
would
be
quite
unintelligible
if
they
were
recorded
here
demanded
a
glass
of
liquor
mind
you
do
poison
it
said
sikes
laying
his
hat
upon
the
table
this
was
said
in
jest
but
if
the
speaker
could
have
seen
the
evil
leer
with
which
the
jew
bit
his
pale
lip
as
he
turned
round
to
the
cupboard
he
might
have
thought
the
caution
not
wholly
unnecessary
or
the
wish
at
all
events
to
improve
upon
the
distiller
ingenuity
not
very
far
from
the
old
gentleman
merry
heart
after
swallowing
two
of
three
glasses
of
spirits
sikes
condescended
to
take
some
notice
of
the
young
gentlemen
which
gracious
act
led
to
a
conversation
in
which
the
cause
and
manner
of
capture
were
circumstantially
detailed
with
such
alterations
and
improvements
on
the
truth
as
to
the
dodger
appeared
most
advisable
under
the
circumstances
afraid
said
the
jew
he
may
say
something
which
will
get
us
into
trouble
very
likely
returned
sikes
with
a
malicious
grin
blowed
upon
fagin
i
afraid
you
see
added
the
jew
speaking
as
if
he
had
not
noticed
the
interruption
and
regarding
the
other
closely
as
he
did
so
afraid
that
if
the
game
was
up
with
us
it
might
be
up
with
a
good
many
more
and
that
it
would
come
out
rather
worse
for
you
than
it
would
for
me
my
dear
the
man
started
and
turned
round
upon
the
jew
but
the
old
gentleman
shoulders
were
shrugged
up
to
his
ears
and
his
eyes
were
vacantly
staring
on
the
opposite
wall
there
was
a
long
pause
every
member
of
the
respectable
coterie
appeared
plunged
in
his
own
reflections
not
excepting
the
dog
who
by
a
certain
malicious
licking
of
his
lips
seemed
to
be
meditating
an
attack
upon
the
legs
of
the
first
gentleman
or
lady
he
might
encounter
in
the
streets
when
he
went
out
must
find
out
wot
been
done
at
the
office
said
sikes
in
a
much
lower
tone
than
he
had
taken
since
he
came
in
the
jew
nodded
assent
he
has
peached
and
is
committed
there
no
fear
till
he
comes
out
again
said
sikes
then
he
must
be
taken
care
on
you
must
get
hold
of
him
somehow
again
the
jew
nodded
the
prudence
of
this
line
of
action
indeed
was
obvious
but
unfortunately
there
was
one
very
strong
objection
to
its
being
adopted
this
was
that
the
dodger
and
charley
bates
and
fagin
and
william
sikes
happened
one
and
all
to
entertain
a
violent
and
antipathy
to
going
near
a
on
any
ground
or
pretext
whatever
how
long
they
might
have
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
not
the
most
pleasant
of
its
kind
it
is
difficult
to
guess
it
is
not
necessary
to
make
any
guesses
on
the
subject
however
for
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
two
young
ladies
whom
oliver
had
seen
on
a
former
occasion
caused
the
conversation
to
flow
afresh
very
thing
said
the
jew
will
go
wo
you
my
dear
inquired
the
young
lady
just
up
to
the
office
my
dear
said
the
jew
coaxingly
it
is
due
to
the
young
lady
to
say
that
she
did
not
positively
affirm
that
she
would
not
but
that
she
merely
expressed
an
emphatic
and
earnest
desire
to
be
if
she
would
a
polite
and
delicate
evasion
of
the
request
which
shows
the
young
lady
to
have
been
possessed
of
that
natural
good
breeding
which
can
not
bear
to
inflict
upon
a
the
pain
of
a
direct
and
pointed
refusal
the
jew
countenance
fell
he
turned
from
this
young
lady
who
was
gaily
not
to
say
gorgeously
attired
in
a
red
gown
green
boots
and
yellow
to
the
other
female
my
dear
said
the
jew
in
a
soothing
manner
do
you
say
it
wo
do
so
it
no
use
it
on
fagin
replied
nancy
do
you
mean
by
that
said
sikes
looking
up
in
a
surly
manner
i
say
bill
replied
the
lady
collectedly
you
just
the
very
person
for
it
reasoned
sikes
about
here
knows
anything
of
you
as
i
do
want
to
neither
replied
nancy
in
the
same
composed
manner
rather
more
no
than
yes
with
me
bill
go
fagin
said
sikes
she
wo
fagin
said
nancy
she
will
fagin
said
sikes
and
sikes
was
right
by
dint
of
alternate
threats
promises
and
bribes
the
lady
in
question
was
ultimately
prevailed
upon
to
undertake
the
commission
she
was
not
indeed
withheld
by
the
same
considerations
as
her
agreeable
friend
for
having
recently
removed
into
the
neighborhood
of
field
lane
from
the
remote
but
genteel
suburb
of
ratcliffe
she
was
not
under
the
same
apprehension
of
being
recognised
by
any
of
her
numerous
acquaintances
accordingly
with
a
clean
white
apron
tied
over
her
gown
and
her
tucked
up
under
a
straw
bonnet
both
articles
of
dress
being
provided
from
the
jew
inexhaustible
stock
miss
nancy
prepared
to
issue
forth
on
her
errand
a
minute
my
dear
said
the
jew
producing
a
little
covered
basket
that
in
one
hand
it
looks
more
respectable
my
dear
her
a
to
carry
in
her
one
fagin
said
sikes
looks
real
and
genivine
like
yes
my
dear
so
it
does
said
the
jew
hanging
a
large
key
on
the
forefinger
of
the
young
lady
right
hand
very
good
very
good
indeed
my
dear
said
the
jew
rubbing
his
hands
my
brother
my
poor
dear
sweet
innocent
little
brother
exclaimed
nancy
bursting
into
tears
and
wringing
the
little
basket
and
the
key
in
an
agony
of
distress
has
become
of
him
where
have
they
taken
him
to
oh
do
have
pity
and
tell
me
what
been
done
with
the
dear
boy
gentlemen
do
gentlemen
if
you
please
gentlemen
having
uttered
those
words
in
a
most
lamentable
and
tone
to
the
immeasurable
delight
of
her
hearers
miss
nancy
paused
winked
to
the
company
nodded
smilingly
round
and
disappeared
she
a
clever
girl
my
dears
said
the
jew
turning
round
to
his
young
friends
and
shaking
his
head
gravely
as
if
in
mute
admonition
to
them
to
follow
the
bright
example
they
had
just
beheld
a
honour
to
her
sex
said
sikes
filling
his
glass
and
smiting
the
table
with
his
enormous
fist
her
health
and
wishing
they
was
all
like
her
while
these
and
many
other
encomiums
were
being
passed
on
the
accomplished
nancy
that
young
lady
made
the
best
of
her
way
to
the
whither
notwithstanding
a
little
natural
timidity
consequent
upon
walking
through
the
streets
alone
and
unprotected
she
arrived
in
perfect
safety
shortly
afterwards
entering
by
the
back
way
she
tapped
softly
with
the
key
at
one
of
the
and
listened
there
was
no
sound
within
so
she
coughed
and
listened
again
still
there
was
no
reply
so
she
spoke
dear
murmured
nancy
in
a
gentle
voice
there
was
nobody
inside
but
a
miserable
shoeless
criminal
who
had
been
taken
up
for
playing
the
flute
and
who
the
offence
against
society
having
been
clearly
proved
had
been
very
properly
committed
by
fang
to
the
house
of
correction
for
one
month
with
the
appropriate
and
amusing
remark
that
since
he
had
so
much
breath
to
spare
it
would
be
more
wholesomely
expended
on
the
treadmill
than
in
a
musical
instrument
he
made
no
answer
being
occupied
mentally
bewailing
the
loss
of
the
flute
which
had
been
confiscated
for
the
use
of
the
county
so
nancy
passed
on
to
the
next
cell
and
knocked
there
cried
a
faint
and
feeble
voice
there
a
little
boy
here
inquired
nancy
with
a
preliminary
sob
replied
the
voice
forbid
this
was
a
vagrant
of
who
was
going
to
prison
for
playing
the
flute
or
in
other
words
for
begging
in
the
streets
and
doing
nothing
for
his
livelihood
in
the
next
cell
was
another
man
who
was
going
to
the
same
prison
for
hawking
tin
saucepans
without
license
thereby
doing
something
for
his
living
in
defiance
of
the
but
as
neither
of
these
criminals
answered
to
the
name
of
oliver
or
knew
anything
about
him
nancy
made
straight
up
to
the
bluff
officer
in
the
striped
waistcoat
and
with
the
most
piteous
wailings
and
lamentations
rendered
more
piteous
by
a
prompt
and
efficient
use
of
the
key
and
the
little
basket
demanded
her
own
dear
brother
have
got
him
my
dear
said
the
old
man
is
he
screamed
nancy
in
a
distracted
manner
the
gentleman
got
him
replied
the
officer
gentleman
oh
gracious
heavens
what
gentleman
exclaimed
nancy
in
reply
to
this
incoherent
questioning
the
old
man
informed
the
deeply
affected
sister
that
oliver
had
been
taken
ill
in
the
office
and
discharged
in
consequence
of
a
witness
having
proved
the
robbery
to
have
been
committed
by
another
boy
not
in
custody
and
that
the
prosecutor
had
carried
him
away
in
an
insensible
condition
to
his
own
residence
of
and
concerning
which
all
the
informant
knew
was
that
it
was
somewhere
in
pentonville
he
having
heard
that
word
mentioned
in
the
directions
to
the
coachman
in
a
dreadful
state
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
the
agonised
young
woman
staggered
to
the
gate
and
then
exchanging
her
faltering
walk
for
a
swift
run
returned
by
the
most
devious
and
complicated
route
she
could
think
of
to
the
domicile
of
the
jew
bill
sikes
no
sooner
heard
the
account
of
the
expedition
delivered
than
he
very
hastily
called
up
the
white
dog
and
putting
on
his
hat
expeditiously
departed
without
devoting
any
time
to
the
formality
of
wishing
the
company
must
know
where
he
is
my
dears
he
must
be
found
said
the
jew
greatly
excited
do
nothing
but
skulk
about
till
you
bring
home
some
news
of
him
nancy
my
dear
i
must
have
him
found
i
trust
to
you
my
dear
to
you
and
the
artful
for
everything

added
the
jew
unlocking
a
drawer
with
a
shaking
hand
money
my
dears
i
shall
shut
up
this
shop
you
know
where
to
find
me
do
stop
here
a
minute
not
an
instant
my
dears
with
these
words
he
pushed
them
from
the
room
and
carefully
and
barring
the
door
behind
them
drew
from
its
place
of
concealment
the
box
which
he
had
unintentionally
disclosed
to
oliver
then
he
hastily
proceeded
to
dispose
the
watches
and
jewellery
beneath
his
clothing
a
rap
at
the
door
startled
him
in
this
occupation
there
he
cried
in
a
shrill
tone
replied
the
voice
of
the
dodger
through
the
now
cried
the
jew
impatiently
he
to
be
kidnapped
to
the
other
ken
nancy
says
inquired
the
dodger
replied
the
jew
she
lays
hands
on
him
find
him
find
him
out
that
all
i
shall
know
what
to
do
next
never
fear
the
boy
murmured
a
reply
of
intelligence
and
hurried
downstairs
after
his
companions
has
not
peached
so
far
said
the
jew
as
he
pursued
his
occupation
he
means
to
blab
us
among
his
new
friends
we
may
stop
his
mouth
yet
chapter
xiv
comprising
further
particulars
of
oliver
stay
at
brownlow
with
the
remarkable
prediction
which
one
grimwig
uttered
concerning
him
when
he
went
out
on
an
errand
oliver
soon
recovering
from
the
into
which
abrupt
exclamation
had
thrown
him
the
subject
of
the
picture
was
carefully
avoided
both
by
the
old
gentleman
and
bedwin
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
which
indeed
bore
no
reference
to
history
or
prospects
but
was
confined
to
such
topics
as
might
amuse
without
exciting
him
he
was
still
too
weak
to
get
up
to
breakfast
but
when
he
came
down
into
the
housekeeper
room
next
day
his
first
act
was
to
cast
an
eager
glance
at
the
wall
in
the
hope
of
again
looking
on
the
face
of
the
beautiful
lady
his
expectations
were
disappointed
however
for
the
picture
had
been
removed
said
the
housekeeper
watching
the
direction
of
oliver
eyes
is
gone
you
see
see
it
is
replied
oliver
have
they
taken
it
away
has
been
taken
down
child
because
brownlow
said
that
as
it
seemed
to
worry
you
perhaps
it
might
prevent
your
getting
well
you
know
rejoined
the
old
lady
no
indeed
it
did
worry
me
said
oliver
liked
to
see
it
i
quite
loved
it
well
said
the
old
lady
get
well
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
dear
and
it
shall
be
hung
up
again
there
i
promise
you
that
now
let
us
talk
about
something
else
this
was
all
the
information
oliver
could
obtain
about
the
picture
at
that
time
as
the
old
lady
had
been
so
kind
to
him
in
his
illness
he
endeavoured
to
think
no
more
of
the
subject
just
then
so
he
listened
attentively
to
a
great
many
stories
she
told
him
about
an
amiable
and
handsome
daughter
of
hers
who
was
married
to
an
amiable
and
handsome
man
and
lived
in
the
country
and
about
a
son
who
was
clerk
to
a
merchant
in
the
west
indies
and
who
was
also
such
a
good
young
man
and
wrote
such
dutiful
letters
home
four
times
that
it
brought
the
tears
into
her
eyes
to
talk
about
them
when
the
old
lady
had
expatiated
a
long
time
on
the
excellences
of
her
children
and
the
merits
of
her
kind
good
husband
besides
who
had
been
dead
and
gone
poor
dear
soul
just
years
it
was
time
to
have
tea
after
tea
she
began
to
teach
oliver
cribbage
which
he
learnt
as
quickly
as
she
could
teach
and
at
which
game
they
played
with
great
interest
and
gravity
until
it
was
time
for
the
invalid
to
have
some
warm
wine
and
water
with
a
slice
of
dry
toast
and
then
to
go
cosily
to
bed
they
were
happy
days
those
of
oliver
recovery
everything
was
so
quiet
and
neat
and
orderly
everybody
so
kind
and
gentle
that
after
the
noise
and
turbulence
in
the
midst
of
which
he
had
always
lived
it
seemed
like
heaven
itself
he
was
no
sooner
strong
enough
to
put
his
clothes
on
properly
than
brownlow
caused
a
complete
new
suit
and
a
new
cap
and
a
new
pair
of
shoes
to
be
provided
for
him
as
oliver
was
told
that
he
might
do
what
he
liked
with
the
old
clothes
he
gave
them
to
a
servant
who
had
been
very
kind
to
him
and
asked
her
to
sell
them
to
a
jew
and
keep
the
money
for
herself
this
she
very
readily
did
and
as
oliver
looked
out
of
the
parlour
window
and
saw
the
jew
roll
them
up
in
his
bag
and
walk
away
he
felt
quite
delighted
to
think
that
they
were
safely
gone
and
that
there
was
now
no
possible
danger
of
his
ever
being
able
to
wear
them
again
they
were
sad
rags
to
tell
the
truth
and
oliver
had
never
had
a
new
suit
before
one
evening
about
a
week
after
the
affair
of
the
picture
as
he
was
sitting
talking
to
bedwin
there
came
a
message
down
from
brownlow
that
if
oliver
twist
felt
pretty
well
he
should
like
to
see
him
in
his
study
and
talk
to
him
a
little
while
us
and
save
us
wash
your
hands
and
let
me
part
your
hair
nicely
for
you
child
said
bedwin
heart
alive
if
we
had
known
he
would
have
asked
for
you
we
would
have
put
you
a
clean
collar
on
and
made
you
as
smart
as
sixpence
oliver
did
as
the
old
lady
bade
him
and
although
she
lamented
grievously
meanwhile
that
there
was
not
even
time
to
crimp
the
little
frill
that
bordered
his
he
looked
so
delicate
and
handsome
despite
that
important
personal
advantage
that
she
went
so
far
as
to
say
looking
at
him
with
great
complacency
from
head
to
foot
that
she
really
did
think
it
would
have
been
possible
on
the
longest
notice
to
have
made
much
difference
in
him
for
the
better
thus
encouraged
oliver
tapped
at
the
study
door
on
brownlow
calling
to
him
to
come
in
he
found
himself
in
a
little
back
room
quite
full
of
books
with
a
window
looking
into
some
pleasant
little
gardens
there
was
a
table
drawn
up
before
the
window
at
which
brownlow
was
seated
reading
when
he
saw
oliver
he
pushed
the
book
away
from
him
and
told
him
to
come
near
the
table
and
sit
down
oliver
complied
marvelling
where
the
people
could
be
found
to
read
such
a
great
number
of
books
as
seemed
to
be
written
to
make
the
world
wiser
which
is
still
a
marvel
to
more
experienced
people
than
oliver
twist
every
day
of
their
lives
are
a
good
many
books
are
there
not
my
boy
said
brownlow
observing
the
curiosity
with
which
oliver
surveyed
the
shelves
that
reached
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
great
number
sir
replied
oliver
never
saw
so
many
shall
read
them
if
you
behave
well
said
the
old
gentleman
kindly
you
will
like
that
better
than
looking
at
the
outsides
that
is
some
cases
because
there
are
books
of
which
the
backs
and
covers
are
by
far
the
best
parts
suppose
they
are
those
heavy
ones
sir
said
oliver
pointing
to
some
large
quartos
with
a
good
deal
of
gilding
about
the
binding
always
those
said
the
old
gentleman
patting
oliver
on
the
head
and
smiling
as
he
did
so
are
other
equally
heavy
ones
though
of
a
much
smaller
size
how
should
you
like
to
grow
up
a
clever
man
and
write
books
eh
think
i
would
rather
read
them
sir
replied
oliver
would
you
like
to
be
a
said
the
old
gentleman
oliver
considered
a
little
while
and
at
last
said
he
should
think
it
would
be
a
much
better
thing
to
be
a
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
laughed
heartily
and
declared
he
had
said
a
very
good
thing
which
oliver
felt
glad
to
have
done
though
he
by
no
means
knew
what
it
was
well
said
the
old
gentleman
composing
his
features
be
afraid
we
wo
make
an
author
of
you
while
there
an
honest
trade
to
be
learnt
or
to
turn
to
you
sir
said
oliver
at
the
earnest
manner
of
his
reply
the
old
gentleman
laughed
again
and
said
something
about
a
curious
instinct
which
oliver
not
understanding
paid
no
very
great
attention
to
said
brownlow
speaking
if
possible
in
a
kinder
but
at
the
same
time
in
a
much
more
serious
manner
than
oliver
had
ever
known
him
assume
yet
want
you
to
pay
great
attention
my
boy
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
shall
talk
to
you
without
any
reserve
because
i
am
sure
you
are
well
able
to
understand
me
as
many
older
persons
would
be
do
tell
you
are
going
to
send
me
away
sir
pray
exclaimed
oliver
alarmed
at
the
serious
tone
of
the
old
commencement
turn
me
out
of
doors
to
wander
in
the
streets
again
let
me
stay
here
and
be
a
servant
do
send
me
back
to
the
wretched
place
i
came
from
have
mercy
upon
a
poor
boy
sir
dear
child
said
the
old
gentleman
moved
by
the
warmth
of
oliver
sudden
appeal
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
deserting
you
unless
you
give
me
cause
never
never
will
sir
interposed
oliver
hope
not
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
do
not
think
you
ever
will
i
have
been
deceived
before
in
the
objects
whom
i
have
endeavoured
to
benefit
but
i
feel
strongly
disposed
to
trust
you
nevertheless
and
i
am
more
interested
in
your
behalf
than
i
can
well
account
for
even
to
myself
the
persons
on
whom
i
have
bestowed
my
dearest
love
lie
deep
in
their
graves
but
although
the
happiness
and
delight
of
my
life
lie
buried
there
too
i
have
not
made
a
coffin
of
my
heart
and
sealed
it
up
forever
on
my
best
affections
deep
affliction
has
but
strengthened
and
refined
them
as
the
old
gentleman
said
this
in
a
low
voice
more
to
himself
than
to
his
companion
and
as
he
remained
silent
for
a
short
time
afterwards
oliver
sat
quite
still
well
said
the
old
gentleman
at
length
in
a
more
cheerful
tone
only
say
this
because
you
have
a
young
heart
and
knowing
that
i
have
suffered
great
pain
and
sorrow
you
will
be
more
careful
perhaps
not
to
wound
me
again
you
say
you
are
an
orphan
without
a
friend
in
the
world
all
the
inquiries
i
have
been
able
to
make
confirm
the
statement
let
me
hear
your
story
where
you
come
from
who
brought
you
up
and
how
you
got
into
the
company
in
which
i
found
you
speak
the
truth
and
you
shall
not
be
friendless
while
i
live
oliver
sobs
checked
his
utterance
for
some
minutes
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
beginning
to
relate
how
he
had
been
brought
up
at
the
farm
and
carried
to
the
workhouse
by
bumble
a
peculiarly
impatient
little
was
heard
at
the
and
the
servant
running
upstairs
announced
grimwig
he
coming
up
inquired
brownlow
sir
replied
the
servant
asked
if
there
were
any
muffins
in
the
house
and
when
i
told
him
yes
he
said
he
had
come
to
tea
brownlow
smiled
and
turning
to
oliver
said
that
grimwig
was
an
old
friend
of
his
and
he
must
not
mind
his
being
a
little
rough
in
his
manners
for
he
was
a
worthy
creature
at
bottom
as
he
had
reason
to
know
i
go
downstairs
sir
inquired
oliver
replied
brownlow
would
rather
you
remained
here
at
this
moment
there
walked
into
the
room
supporting
himself
by
a
thick
stick
a
stout
old
gentleman
rather
lame
in
one
leg
who
was
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
striped
waistcoat
nankeen
breeches
and
gaiters
and
a
white
hat
with
the
sides
turned
up
with
green
a
very
shirt
frill
stuck
out
from
his
waistcoat
and
a
very
long
steel
with
nothing
but
a
key
at
the
end
dangled
loosely
below
it
the
ends
of
his
white
neckerchief
were
twisted
into
a
ball
about
the
size
of
an
orange
the
variety
of
shapes
into
which
his
countenance
was
twisted
defy
description
he
had
a
manner
of
screwing
his
head
on
one
side
when
he
spoke
and
of
looking
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
at
the
same
time
which
irresistibly
reminded
the
beholder
of
a
parrot
in
this
attitude
he
fixed
himself
the
moment
he
made
his
appearance
and
holding
out
a
small
piece
of
at
arm
length
exclaimed
in
a
growling
discontented
voice
here
do
you
see
this
is
it
a
most
wonderful
and
extraordinary
thing
that
i
ca
call
at
a
man
house
but
i
find
a
piece
of
this
poor
surgeon
friend
on
the
staircase
i
been
lamed
with
once
and
i
know
will
be
my
death
or
be
content
to
eat
my
own
head
sir
this
was
the
handsome
offer
with
which
grimwig
backed
and
confirmed
nearly
every
assertion
he
made
and
it
was
the
more
singular
in
his
case
because
even
admitting
for
the
sake
of
argument
the
possibility
of
scientific
improvements
being
brought
to
that
pass
which
will
enable
a
gentleman
to
eat
his
own
head
in
the
event
of
his
being
so
disposed
grimwig
head
was
such
a
particularly
large
one
that
the
most
sanguine
man
alive
could
hardly
entertain
a
hope
of
being
able
to
get
through
it
at
a
sitting
to
put
entirely
out
of
the
question
a
very
thick
coating
of
powder
eat
my
head
sir
repeated
grimwig
striking
his
stick
upon
the
ground
what
that
looking
at
oliver
and
retreating
a
pace
or
two
is
young
oliver
twist
whom
we
were
speaking
about
said
brownlow
oliver
bowed
do
mean
to
say
that
the
boy
who
had
the
fever
i
hope
said
grimwig
recoiling
a
little
more
a
minute
do
speak
stop
continued
grimwig
abruptly
losing
all
dread
of
the
fever
in
his
triumph
at
the
discovery
the
boy
who
had
the
orange
if
that
not
the
boy
sir
who
had
the
orange
and
threw
this
bit
of
peel
upon
the
staircase
i
eat
my
head
and
his
too
no
he
has
not
had
one
said
brownlow
laughing
put
down
your
hat
and
speak
to
my
young
friend
feel
strongly
on
this
subject
sir
said
the
irritable
old
gentleman
drawing
off
his
gloves
always
more
or
less
on
the
pavement
in
our
street
and
i
it
put
there
by
the
surgeon
boy
at
the
corner
a
young
woman
stumbled
over
a
bit
last
night
and
fell
against
my
directly
she
got
up
i
saw
her
look
towards
his
infernal
red
lamp
with
the
do
go
to
him
i
called
out
of
the
window
he
an
assassin
a
so
he
is
if
he
is
not
here
the
irascible
old
gentleman
gave
a
great
knock
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
which
was
always
understood
by
his
friends
to
imply
the
customary
offer
whenever
it
was
not
expressed
in
words
then
still
keeping
his
stick
in
his
hand
he
sat
down
and
opening
a
double
which
he
wore
attached
to
a
broad
black
riband
took
a
view
of
oliver
who
seeing
that
he
was
the
object
of
inspection
coloured
and
bowed
again
the
boy
is
it
said
grimwig
at
length
the
boy
replied
brownlow
are
you
boy
said
grimwig
great
deal
better
thank
you
sir
replied
oliver
brownlow
seeming
to
apprehend
that
his
singular
friend
was
about
to
say
something
disagreeable
asked
oliver
to
step
downstairs
and
tell
bedwin
they
were
ready
for
tea
which
as
he
did
not
half
like
the
visitor
manner
he
was
very
happy
to
do
is
a
boy
is
he
not
inquired
brownlow
do
know
replied
grimwig
pettishly
know
i
do
know
i
never
see
any
difference
in
boys
i
only
knew
two
sort
of
boys
mealy
boys
and
boys
which
is
oliver
i
know
a
friend
who
has
a
boy
a
fine
boy
they
call
him
with
a
round
head
and
red
cheeks
and
glaring
eyes
a
horrid
boy
with
a
body
and
limbs
that
appear
to
be
swelling
out
of
the
seams
of
his
blue
clothes
with
the
voice
of
a
pilot
and
the
appetite
of
a
wolf
i
know
him
the
wretch
said
brownlow
are
not
the
characteristics
of
young
oliver
twist
so
he
need
excite
your
wrath
are
not
replied
grimwig
may
have
worse
here
brownlow
coughed
impatiently
which
appeared
to
afford
grimwig
the
most
exquisite
delight
may
have
worse
i
say
repeated
grimwig
does
he
come
from
who
is
he
what
is
he
he
has
had
a
fever
what
of
that
fevers
are
not
peculiar
to
good
people
are
they
bad
people
have
fevers
sometimes
have
they
eh
i
knew
a
man
who
was
hung
in
jamaica
for
murdering
his
master
he
had
had
a
fever
six
times
he
was
recommended
to
mercy
on
that
account
pooh
nonsense
now
the
fact
was
that
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
own
heart
grimwig
was
strongly
disposed
to
admit
that
oliver
appearance
and
manner
were
unusually
prepossessing
but
he
had
a
strong
appetite
for
contradiction
sharpened
on
this
occasion
by
the
finding
of
the
and
inwardly
determining
that
no
man
should
dictate
to
him
whether
a
boy
was
or
not
he
had
resolved
from
the
first
to
oppose
his
friend
when
brownlow
admitted
that
on
no
one
point
of
inquiry
could
he
yet
return
a
satisfactory
answer
and
that
he
had
postponed
any
investigation
into
oliver
previous
history
until
he
thought
the
boy
was
strong
enough
to
hear
it
grimwig
chuckled
maliciously
and
he
demanded
with
a
sneer
whether
the
housekeeper
was
in
the
habit
of
counting
the
plate
at
night
because
if
she
find
a
or
two
missing
some
sunshiny
morning
why
he
would
be
content
to
and
so
forth
all
this
brownlow
although
himself
somewhat
of
an
impetuous
gentleman
knowing
his
friend
peculiarities
bore
with
great
good
humour
as
grimwig
at
tea
was
graciously
pleased
to
express
his
entire
approval
of
the
muffins
matters
went
on
very
smoothly
and
oliver
who
made
one
of
the
party
began
to
feel
more
at
his
ease
than
he
had
yet
done
in
the
fierce
old
gentleman
presence
when
are
you
going
to
hear
a
full
true
and
particular
account
of
the
life
and
adventures
of
oliver
twist
asked
grimwig
of
brownlow
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
looking
sideways
at
oliver
as
he
resumed
his
subject
morning
replied
brownlow
would
rather
he
was
alone
with
me
at
the
time
come
up
to
me
morning
at
ten
my
dear
sir
replied
oliver
he
answered
with
some
hesitation
because
he
was
confused
by
grimwig
looking
so
hard
at
him
tell
you
what
whispered
that
gentleman
to
brownlow
wo
come
up
to
you
morning
i
saw
him
hesitate
he
is
deceiving
you
my
good
friend
swear
he
is
not
replied
brownlow
warmly
he
is
not
said
grimwig
and
down
went
the
stick
answer
for
that
boy
truth
with
my
life
said
brownlow
knocking
the
table
i
for
his
falsehood
with
my
head
rejoined
grimwig
knocking
the
table
also
shall
see
said
brownlow
checking
his
rising
anger
will
replied
grimwig
with
a
provoking
smile
will
as
fate
would
have
it
bedwin
chanced
to
bring
in
at
this
moment
a
small
parcel
of
books
which
brownlow
had
that
morning
purchased
of
the
identical
who
has
already
figured
in
this
history
having
laid
them
on
the
table
she
prepared
to
leave
the
room
the
boy
mrs
bedwin
said
brownlow
is
something
to
go
back
has
gone
sir
replied
bedwin
after
him
said
brownlow
particular
he
is
a
poor
man
and
they
are
not
paid
for
there
are
some
books
to
be
taken
back
too
the
was
opened
oliver
ran
one
way
and
the
girl
ran
another
and
bedwin
stood
on
the
step
and
screamed
for
the
boy
but
there
was
no
boy
in
sight
oliver
and
the
girl
returned
in
a
breathless
state
to
report
that
there
were
no
tidings
of
him
me
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
exclaimed
brownlow
particularly
wished
those
books
to
be
returned
oliver
with
them
said
grimwig
with
an
ironical
smile
will
be
sure
to
deliver
them
safely
you
know
do
let
me
take
them
if
you
please
sir
said
oliver
run
all
the
way
sir
the
old
gentleman
was
just
going
to
say
that
oliver
should
not
go
out
on
any
account
when
a
most
malicious
cough
from
grimwig
determined
him
that
he
should
and
that
by
his
prompt
discharge
of
the
commission
he
should
prove
to
him
the
injustice
of
his
suspicions
on
this
head
at
least
at
once
go
my
dear
said
the
old
gentleman
books
are
on
a
chair
by
my
table
fetch
them
down
oliver
delighted
to
be
of
use
brought
down
the
books
under
his
arm
in
a
great
bustle
and
waited
cap
in
hand
to
hear
what
message
he
was
to
take
are
to
say
said
brownlow
glancing
steadily
at
grimwig
are
to
say
that
you
have
brought
those
books
back
and
that
you
have
come
to
pay
the
four
pound
ten
i
owe
him
this
is
a
note
so
you
will
have
to
bring
me
back
ten
shillings
change
wo
be
ten
minutes
sir
said
oliver
eagerly
having
buttoned
up
the
in
his
jacket
pocket
and
placed
the
books
carefully
under
his
arm
he
made
a
respectful
bow
and
left
the
room
bedwin
followed
him
to
the
giving
him
many
directions
about
the
nearest
way
and
the
name
of
the
bookseller
and
the
name
of
the
street
all
of
which
oliver
said
he
clearly
understood
having
superadded
many
injunctions
to
be
sure
and
not
take
cold
the
old
lady
at
length
permitted
him
to
depart
his
sweet
face
said
the
old
lady
looking
after
him
bear
somehow
to
let
him
go
out
of
my
sight
at
this
moment
oliver
looked
gaily
round
and
nodded
before
he
turned
the
corner
the
old
lady
smilingly
returned
his
salutation
and
closing
the
door
went
back
to
her
own
room
me
see
he
be
back
in
twenty
minutes
at
the
longest
said
brownlow
pulling
out
his
watch
and
placing
it
on
the
table
will
be
dark
by
that
time
you
really
expect
him
to
come
back
do
you
inquired
grimwig
you
asked
brownlow
smiling
the
spirit
of
contradiction
was
strong
in
grimwig
breast
at
the
moment
and
it
was
rendered
stronger
by
his
friend
confident
smile
he
said
smiting
the
table
with
his
fist
do
not
the
boy
has
a
new
suit
of
clothes
on
his
back
a
set
of
valuable
books
under
his
arm
and
a
note
in
his
pocket
he
join
his
old
friends
the
thieves
and
laugh
at
you
if
ever
that
boy
returns
to
this
house
sir
i
eat
my
head
with
these
words
he
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
table
and
there
the
two
friends
sat
in
silent
expectation
with
the
watch
between
them
it
is
worthy
of
remark
as
illustrating
the
importance
we
attach
to
our
own
judgments
and
the
pride
with
which
we
put
forth
our
most
rash
and
hasty
conclusions
that
although
grimwig
was
not
by
any
means
a
man
and
though
he
would
have
been
unfeignedly
sorry
to
see
his
respected
friend
duped
and
deceived
he
really
did
most
earnestly
and
strongly
hope
at
that
moment
that
oliver
twist
might
not
come
back
it
grew
so
dark
that
the
figures
on
the
were
scarcely
discernible
but
there
the
two
old
gentlemen
continued
to
sit
in
silence
with
the
watch
between
them
chapter
xv
showing
how
very
fond
of
oliver
twist
the
merry
old
jew
and
miss
nancy
were
in
the
obscure
parlour
of
a
low
in
the
filthiest
part
of
little
saffron
hill
a
dark
and
gloomy
den
where
a
flaring
burnt
all
day
in
the
and
where
no
ray
of
sun
ever
shone
in
the
summer
there
sat
brooding
over
a
little
pewter
measure
and
a
small
glass
strongly
impregnated
with
the
smell
of
liquor
a
man
in
a
velveteen
coat
drab
shorts
and
stockings
whom
even
by
that
dim
light
no
experienced
agent
of
the
police
would
have
hesitated
to
recognise
as
william
sikes
at
his
feet
sat
a
dog
who
occupied
himself
alternately
in
winking
at
his
master
with
both
eyes
at
the
same
time
and
in
licking
a
large
fresh
cut
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
which
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
some
recent
conflict
quiet
you
warmint
keep
quiet
said
sikes
suddenly
breaking
silence
whether
his
meditations
were
so
intense
as
to
be
disturbed
by
the
dog
winking
or
whether
his
feelings
were
so
wrought
upon
by
his
reflections
that
they
required
all
the
relief
derivable
from
kicking
an
unoffending
animal
to
allay
them
is
matter
for
argument
and
consideration
whatever
was
the
cause
the
effect
was
a
kick
and
a
curse
bestowed
upon
the
dog
simultaneously
dogs
are
not
generally
apt
to
revenge
injuries
inflicted
upon
them
by
their
masters
but
sikes
dog
having
faults
of
temper
in
common
with
his
owner
and
labouring
perhaps
at
this
moment
under
a
powerful
sense
of
injury
made
no
more
ado
but
at
once
fixed
his
teeth
in
one
of
the
having
given
in
a
hearty
shake
he
retired
growling
under
a
form
just
escaping
the
pewter
measure
which
sikes
levelled
at
his
head
would
would
you
said
sikes
seizing
the
poker
in
one
hand
and
deliberately
opening
with
the
other
a
large
which
he
drew
from
his
pocket
here
you
born
devil
come
here
d
hear
the
dog
no
doubt
heard
because
sikes
spoke
in
the
very
harshest
key
of
a
very
harsh
voice
but
appearing
to
entertain
some
unaccountable
objection
to
having
his
throat
cut
he
remained
where
he
was
and
growled
more
fiercely
than
before
at
the
same
time
grasping
the
end
of
the
poker
between
his
teeth
and
biting
at
it
like
a
wild
beast
this
resistance
only
infuriated
sikes
the
more
who
dropping
on
his
knees
began
to
assail
the
animal
most
furiously
the
dog
jumped
from
right
to
left
and
from
left
to
right
snapping
growling
and
barking
the
man
thrust
and
swore
and
struck
and
blasphemed
and
the
struggle
was
reaching
a
most
critical
point
for
one
or
other
when
the
door
suddenly
opening
the
dog
darted
out
leaving
bill
sikes
with
the
poker
and
the
in
his
hands
there
must
always
be
two
parties
to
a
quarrel
says
the
old
adage
sikes
being
disappointed
of
the
dog
participation
at
once
transferred
his
share
in
the
quarrel
to
the
new
comer
the
devil
do
you
come
in
between
me
and
my
dog
for
said
sikes
with
a
fierce
gesture
did
know
my
dear
i
did
know
replied
fagin
humbly
for
the
jew
was
the
new
comer
know
you
thief
growled
sikes
you
hear
the
noise
a
sound
of
it
as
i
a
living
man
bill
replied
the
jew
no
you
hear
nothing
you
do
retorted
sikes
with
a
fierce
sneer
in
and
out
so
as
nobody
hears
how
you
come
or
go
i
wish
you
had
been
the
dog
fagin
half
a
minute
ago
inquired
the
jew
with
a
forced
smile
the
government
as
cares
for
the
lives
of
such
men
as
you
as
have
half
the
pluck
of
curs
lets
a
man
kill
a
dog
how
he
likes
replied
sikes
shutting
up
the
knife
with
a
very
expressive
look
why
the
jew
rubbed
his
hands
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
affected
to
laugh
at
the
pleasantry
of
his
friend
he
was
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
however
away
said
sikes
replacing
the
poker
and
surveying
him
with
savage
contempt
away
you
never
have
the
laugh
at
me
though
unless
it
behind
a
nightcap
i
got
the
upper
hand
over
you
fagin
and
d
me
i
keep
it
there
if
i
go
you
go
so
take
care
of
me
well
my
dear
said
the
jew
know
all
that
we
we
have
a
mutual
interest
bill
a
mutual
interest
said
sikes
as
if
he
thought
the
interest
lay
rather
more
on
the
jew
side
than
on
his
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
all
passed
safe
through
the
replied
fagin
this
is
your
share
it
rather
more
than
it
ought
to
be
my
dear
but
as
i
know
you
do
me
a
good
turn
another
time
and
that
gammon
interposed
the
robber
impatiently
is
it
hand
over
yes
bill
give
me
time
give
me
time
replied
the
jew
soothingly
it
is
all
safe
as
he
spoke
he
drew
forth
an
old
cotton
handkerchief
from
his
breast
and
untying
a
large
knot
in
one
corner
produced
a
small
packet
sikes
snatching
it
from
him
hastily
opened
it
and
proceeded
to
count
the
sovereigns
it
contained
is
all
is
it
inquired
sikes
replied
the
jew
have
opened
the
parcel
and
swallowed
one
or
two
as
you
come
along
have
you
inquired
sikes
suspiciously
put
on
an
injured
look
at
the
question
you
done
it
many
a
time
jerk
the
tinkler
these
words
in
plain
english
conveyed
an
injunction
to
ring
the
bell
it
was
answered
by
another
jew
younger
than
fagin
but
nearly
as
vile
and
repulsive
in
appearance
bill
sikes
merely
pointed
to
the
empty
measure
the
jew
perfectly
understanding
the
hint
retired
to
fill
it
previously
exchanging
a
remarkable
look
with
fagin
who
raised
his
eyes
for
an
instant
as
if
in
expectation
of
it
and
shook
his
head
in
reply
so
slightly
that
the
action
would
have
been
almost
imperceptible
to
an
observant
third
person
it
was
lost
upon
sikes
who
was
stooping
at
the
moment
to
tie
the
which
the
dog
had
torn
possibly
if
he
had
observed
the
brief
interchange
of
signals
he
might
have
thought
that
it
boded
no
good
to
him
anybody
here
barney
inquired
fagin
speaking
now
that
that
sikes
was
looking
on
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
a
shoul
replied
barney
whose
words
whether
they
came
from
the
heart
or
not
made
their
way
through
the
nose
inquired
fagin
in
a
tone
of
surprise
which
perhaps
might
mean
that
barney
was
at
liberty
to
tell
the
truth
but
biss
dadsy
replied
barney
exclaimed
sikes
strike
me
blind
if
i
do
honour
that
girl
for
her
native
talents
bid
havid
a
plate
of
boiled
beef
id
the
bar
replied
barney
her
here
said
sikes
pouring
out
a
glass
of
liquor
her
here
barney
looked
timidly
at
fagin
as
if
for
permission
the
jew
remaining
silent
and
not
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
ground
he
retired
and
presently
returned
ushering
in
nancy
who
was
decorated
with
the
bonnet
apron
basket
and
key
complete
are
on
the
scent
are
you
nancy
inquired
sikes
proffering
the
glass
i
am
bill
replied
the
young
lady
disposing
of
its
contents
tired
enough
of
it
i
am
too
the
young
brat
been
ill
and
confined
to
the
crib
and
nancy
dear
said
fagin
looking
up
now
whether
a
peculiar
contraction
of
the
jew
red
and
a
half
closing
of
his
eyes
warned
miss
nancy
that
she
was
disposed
to
be
too
communicative
is
not
a
matter
of
much
importance
the
fact
is
all
we
need
care
for
here
and
the
fact
is
that
she
suddenly
checked
herself
and
with
several
gracious
smiles
upon
sikes
turned
the
conversation
to
other
matters
in
about
ten
time
fagin
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
upon
which
nancy
pulled
her
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
declared
it
was
time
to
go
sikes
finding
that
he
was
walking
a
short
part
of
her
way
himself
expressed
his
intention
of
accompanying
her
they
went
away
together
followed
at
a
little
distant
by
the
dog
who
slunk
out
of
a
as
soon
as
his
master
was
out
of
sight
the
jew
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
room
door
when
sikes
had
left
it
looked
after
him
as
he
walked
up
the
dark
passage
shook
his
clenched
fist
muttered
a
deep
curse
and
then
with
a
horrible
grin
reseated
himself
at
the
table
where
he
was
soon
deeply
absorbed
in
the
interesting
pages
of
the
meanwhile
oliver
twist
little
dreaming
that
he
was
within
so
very
short
a
distance
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
was
on
his
way
to
the
when
he
got
into
clerkenwell
he
accidently
turned
down
a
which
was
not
exactly
in
his
way
but
not
discovering
his
mistake
until
he
had
got
down
it
and
knowing
it
must
lead
in
the
right
direction
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
turn
back
and
so
marched
on
as
quickly
as
he
could
with
the
books
under
his
arm
he
was
walking
along
thinking
how
happy
and
contented
he
ought
to
feel
and
how
much
he
would
give
for
only
one
look
at
poor
little
dick
who
starved
and
beaten
might
be
weeping
bitterly
at
that
very
moment
when
he
was
startled
by
a
young
woman
screaming
out
very
loud
my
dear
brother
and
he
had
hardly
looked
up
to
see
what
the
matter
was
when
he
was
stopped
by
having
a
pair
of
arms
thrown
tight
round
his
neck
cried
oliver
struggling
go
of
me
who
is
it
what
are
you
stopping
me
for
the
only
reply
to
this
was
a
great
number
of
loud
lamentations
from
the
young
woman
who
had
embraced
him
and
who
had
a
little
basket
and
a
key
in
her
hand
my
gracious
said
the
young
woman
have
found
him
oh
oliver
oliver
oh
you
naughty
boy
to
make
me
suffer
such
distress
on
your
account
come
home
dear
come
oh
i
found
him
thank
gracious
goodness
heavins
i
found
him
with
these
incoherent
exclamations
the
young
woman
burst
into
another
fit
of
crying
and
got
so
dreadfully
hysterical
that
a
couple
of
women
who
came
up
at
the
moment
asked
a
butcher
boy
with
a
shiny
head
of
hair
anointed
with
suet
who
was
also
looking
on
whether
he
did
think
he
had
better
run
for
the
doctor
to
which
the
butcher
boy
who
appeared
of
a
lounging
not
to
say
indolent
disposition
replied
that
he
thought
not
no
no
never
mind
said
the
young
woman
grasping
oliver
hand
better
now
come
home
directly
you
cruel
boy
come
replied
the
young
woman
ran
away
near
a
month
ago
from
his
parents
who
are
and
respectable
people
and
went
and
joined
a
set
of
thieves
and
bad
characters
and
almost
broke
his
mother
heart
wretch
said
one
woman
home

oliver

cried
the
young
woman
it
nancy
exclaimed
oliver
who
now
saw
her
face
for
the
first
time
and
started
back
in
irrepressible
astonishment
see
he
knows
me
cried
nancy
appealing
to
the
bystanders
ca
help
himself
make
him
come
home
there
good
people
or
kill
his
dear
mother
and
father
and
break
my
heart

said
a
man
bursting
out
of
a
with
a
white
dog
at
his
heels
oliver
come

your
poor
mother

oliver
struggling
in
the
man
powerful
grasp
repeated
the
man

young
rascal

been
a
stealing

here
with
these
words
the
man
tore
the
volumes
from
his
grasp
and
struck
him
on
the
head
right
cried
a
from
a
the
only
way
of
bringing
him
to
his
senses
be
sure
cried
a
carpenter
casting
an
approving
look
at
the
do
him
good
said
the
two
women
he
shall
have

too
rejoined
the
man
administering
another
blow
and
seizing
oliver
by
the
collar
on
you
young
villain
here
mind
him
boy
mind
him
weak
with
recent
illness
stupified
by
the
blows
and
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
terrified
by
the
fierce
growling
of
the
dog
and
the
brutality
of
the
man
overpowered
by
the
conviction
of
the
bystanders
that
he
really
was
the
hardened
little
wretch
he
was
described
to
be
what
could
one
poor
child
do
darkness
had
set
in
it
was
a
low
neighborhood
no
help
was
near
resistance
was
useless
in
another
moment
he
was
dragged
into
a
labyrinth
of
dark
narrow
courts
and
was
forced
along
them
at
a
pace
which
rendered
the
few
cries
he
dared
to
give
utterance
to
unintelligible
it
was
of
little
moment
indeed
whether
they
were
intelligible
or
no
for
there
was
nobody
to
care
for
them
had
they
been
ever
so
plain
the

bedwin
was
waiting
anxiously
at
the
open
door
the
servant
had
run
up
the
street
twenty
times
to
see
if
there
were
any
traces
of
oliver
and
still
the
two
old
gentlemen
sat
perseveringly
in
the
dark
parlour
with
the
watch
between
them
chapter
xvi
relates
what
became
of
oliver
twist
after
he
had
been
claimed
by
nancy
the
narrow
streets
and
courts
at
length
terminated
in
a
large
open
space
scattered
about
which
were
pens
for
beasts
and
other
indications
of
a
sikes
slackened
his
pace
when
they
reached
this
spot
the
girl
being
quite
unable
to
support
any
longer
the
rapid
rate
at
which
they
had
hitherto
walked
turning
to
oliver
he
roughly
commanded
him
to
take
hold
of
nancy
hand
you
hear
growled
sikes
as
oliver
hesitated
and
looked
round
they
were
in
a
dark
corner
quite
out
of
the
track
of
passengers
oliver
saw
but
too
plainly
that
resistance
would
be
of
no
avail
he
held
out
his
hand
which
nancy
clasped
tight
in
hers
me
the
other
said
sikes
seizing
oliver
unoccupied
hand
the
dog
looked
up
and
growled
here
boy
said
sikes
putting
his
other
hand
to
oliver
throat
he
speaks
ever
so
soft
a
word
hold
him
d
mind
the
dog
growled
again
and
licking
his
lips
eyed
oliver
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
attach
himself
to
his
windpipe
without
delay
as
willing
as
a
christian
strike
me
blind
if
he
is
said
sikes
regarding
the
animal
with
a
kind
of
grim
and
ferocious
approval
you
know
what
you
got
to
expect
master
so
call
away
as
quick
as
you
like
the
dog
will
soon
stop
that
game
get
on
wagged
his
tail
in
acknowledgment
of
this
unusually
endearing
form
of
speech
and
giving
vent
to
another
admonitory
growl
for
the
benefit
of
oliver
led
the
way
onward
it
was
smithfield
that
they
were
crossing
although
it
might
have
been
grosvenor
square
for
anything
oliver
knew
to
the
contrary
the
night
was
dark
and
foggy
the
lights
in
the
shops
could
scarecely
struggle
through
the
heavy
mist
which
thickened
every
moment
and
shrouded
the
streets
and
houses
in
gloom
rendering
the
strange
place
still
stranger
in
oliver
eyes
and
making
his
uncertainty
the
more
dismal
and
depressing
they
had
hurried
on
a
few
paces
when
a
deep
struck
the
hour
with
its
first
stroke
his
two
conductors
stopped
and
turned
their
heads
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
proceeded
o
clock
bill
said
nancy
when
the
bell
ceased
the
good
of
telling
me
that
i
can
hear
it
ca
i
replied
sikes
wonder
whether
they
can
hear
it
said
nancy
course
they
can
replied
sikes
was
bartlemy
time
when
i
was
shopped
and
there
war
a
penny
trumpet
in
the
fair
as
i
hear
the
squeaking
on
arter
i
was
locked
up
for
the
night
the
row
and
din
outside
made
the
thundering
old
jail
so
silent
that
i
could
almost
have
beat
my
brains
out
against
the
iron
plates
of
the
door
fellow
said
nancy
who
still
had
her
face
turned
towards
the
quarter
in
which
the
bell
had
sounded
bill
such
fine
young
chaps
as
them
that
all
you
women
think
of
answered
sikes
young
chaps
well
they
as
good
as
dead
so
it
do
much
matter
with
this
consolation
sikes
appeared
to
repress
a
rising
tendency
to
jealousy
and
clasping
oliver
wrist
more
firmly
told
him
to
step
out
again
a
minute
said
the
girl
would
hurry
by
if
it
was
you
that
was
coming
out
to
be
hung
the
next
time
eight
struck
bill
i
walk
round
and
round
the
place
till
i
dropped
if
the
snow
was
on
the
ground
and
i
had
a
shawl
to
cover
me
what
good
would
that
do
inquired
the
unsentimental
sikes
you
could
pitch
over
a
file
and
twenty
yards
of
good
stout
rope
you
might
as
well
be
walking
fifty
mile
off
or
not
walking
at
all
for
all
the
good
it
would
do
me
come
on
and
do
stand
preaching
there
the
girl
burst
into
a
laugh
drew
her
shawl
more
closely
round
her
and
they
walked
away
but
oliver
felt
her
hand
tremble
and
looking
up
in
her
face
as
they
passed
a
saw
that
it
had
turned
a
deadly
white
they
walked
on
by
and
dirty
ways
for
a
full
meeting
very
few
people
and
those
appearing
from
their
looks
to
hold
much
the
same
position
in
society
as
sikes
himself
at
length
they
turned
into
a
very
filthy
narrow
street
nearly
full
of
shops
the
dog
running
forward
as
if
conscious
that
there
was
no
further
occasion
for
his
keeping
on
guard
stopped
before
the
door
of
a
shop
that
was
closed
and
apparently
untenanted
the
house
was
in
a
ruinous
condition
and
on
the
door
was
nailed
a
board
intimating
that
it
was
to
let
which
looked
as
if
it
had
hung
there
for
many
years
right
cried
sikes
glancing
cautiously
about
nancy
stooped
below
the
shutters
and
oliver
heard
the
sound
of
a
bell
they
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
under
a
lamp
a
noise
as
if
a
sash
window
were
gently
raised
was
heard
and
soon
afterwards
the
door
softly
opened
sikes
then
seized
the
terrified
boy
by
the
collar
with
very
little
ceremony
and
all
three
were
quickly
inside
the
house
the
passage
was
perfectly
dark
they
waited
while
the
person
who
had
let
them
in
chained
and
barred
the
door
here
inquired
sikes
replied
a
voice
which
oliver
thought
he
had
heard
before
the
old
here
asked
the
robber
replied
the
voice
precious
down
in
the
mouth
he
has
been
wo
he
be
glad
to
see
you
oh
no
the
style
of
this
reply
as
well
as
the
voice
which
delivered
it
seemed
familiar
to
oliver
ears
but
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
even
the
form
of
the
speaker
in
the
darkness
have
a
glim
said
sikes
we
shall
go
breaking
our
necks
or
treading
on
the
dog
look
after
your
legs
if
you
do
still
a
moment
and
i
get
you
one
replied
the
voice
the
receding
footsteps
of
the
speaker
were
heard
and
in
another
minute
the
form
of
john
dawkins
otherwise
the
artful
dodger
appeared
he
bore
in
his
right
hand
a
tallow
candle
stuck
in
the
end
of
a
cleft
stick
the
young
gentleman
did
not
stop
to
bestow
any
other
mark
of
recognition
upon
oliver
than
a
humourous
grin
but
turning
away
beckoned
the
visitors
to
follow
him
down
a
flight
of
stairs
they
crossed
an
empty
kitchen
and
opening
the
door
of
a
low
room
which
seemed
to
have
been
built
in
a
small
were
received
with
a
shout
of
laughter
my
wig
my
wig
cried
master
charles
bates
from
whose
lungs
the
laughter
had
proceeded
he
is
oh
cry
here
he
is
oh
fagin
look
at
him
fagin
do
look
at
him
i
ca
bear
it
it
is
such
a
jolly
game
i
cant
bear
it
hold
me
somebody
while
i
laugh
it
out
with
this
irrepressible
ebullition
of
mirth
master
bates
laid
himself
flat
on
the
floor
and
kicked
convulsively
for
five
minutes
in
an
ectasy
of
facetious
joy
then
jumping
to
his
feet
he
snatched
the
cleft
stick
from
the
dodger
and
advancing
to
oliver
viewed
him
round
and
round
while
the
jew
taking
off
his
nightcap
made
a
great
number
of
low
bows
to
the
bewildered
boy
the
artful
meantime
who
was
of
a
rather
saturnine
disposition
and
seldom
gave
way
to
merriment
when
it
interfered
with
business
rifled
oliver
pockets
with
steady
assiduity
at
his
togs
fagin
said
charley
putting
the
light
so
close
to
his
new
jacket
as
nearly
to
set
him
on
fire
at
his
togs
superfine
cloth
and
the
heavy
swell
cut
oh
my
eye
what
a
game
and
his
books
too
nothing
but
a
gentleman
fagin
to
see
you
looking
so
well
my
dear
said
the
jew
bowing
with
mock
humility
artful
shall
give
you
another
suit
my
dear
for
fear
you
should
spoil
that
sunday
one
why
did
you
write
my
dear
and
say
you
were
coming
we
have
got
something
warm
for
supper
at
his
master
bates
roared
again
so
loud
that
fagin
himself
relaxed
and
even
the
dodger
smiled
but
as
the
artful
drew
forth
the
note
at
that
instant
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
sally
of
the
discovery
awakened
his
merriment
what
that
inquired
sikes
stepping
forward
as
the
jew
seized
the
note
mine
fagin
no
my
dear
said
the
jew
bill
mine
you
shall
have
the
books
that
ai
mine
said
bill
sikes
putting
on
his
hat
with
a
determined
air
and
nancy
that
is
i
take
the
boy
back
again
the
jew
started
oliver
started
too
though
from
a
very
different
cause
for
he
hoped
that
the
dispute
might
really
end
in
his
being
taken
back
hand
over
will
you
said
sikes
is
hardly
fair
bill
hardly
fair
is
it
nancy
inquired
the
jew
or
not
fair
retorted
sikes
over
i
tell
you
do
you
think
nancy
and
me
has
got
nothing
else
to
do
with
our
precious
time
but
to
spend
it
in
scouting
arter
and
kidnapping
every
young
boy
as
gets
grabbed
through
you
give
it
here
you
avaricious
old
skeleton
give
it
here
with
this
gentle
remonstrance
sikes
plucked
the
note
from
between
the
jew
finger
and
thumb
and
looking
the
old
man
coolly
in
the
face
folded
it
up
small
and
tied
it
in
his
neckerchief
for
our
share
of
the
trouble
said
sikes
not
half
enough
neither
you
may
keep
the
books
if
you
fond
of
reading
if
you
ai
sell
very
pretty
said
charley
bates
who
with
sundry
grimaces
had
been
affecting
to
read
one
of
the
volumes
in
question
writing
is
is
oliver
at
sight
of
the
dismayed
look
with
which
oliver
regarded
his
tormentors
master
bates
who
was
blessed
with
a
lively
sense
of
the
ludicrous
fell
into
another
ectasy
more
boisterous
than
the
first
belong
to
the
old
gentleman
said
oliver
wringing
his
hands
the
good
kind
old
gentleman
who
took
me
into
his
house
and
had
me
nursed
when
i
was
near
dying
of
the
fever
oh
pray
send
them
back
send
him
back
the
books
and
money
keep
me
here
all
my
life
long
but
pray
pray
send
them
back
he
think
i
stole
them
the
old
lady
all
of
them
who
were
so
kind
to
me
will
think
i
stole
them
oh
do
have
mercy
upon
me
and
send
them
back
with
these
words
which
were
uttered
with
all
the
energy
of
passionate
grief
oliver
fell
upon
his
knees
at
the
jew
feet
and
beat
his
hands
together
in
perfect
desperation
boy
right
remarked
fagin
looking
covertly
round
and
knitting
his
shaggy
eyebrows
into
a
hard
knot
right
oliver
right
they
will
think
you
have
stolen
ha
ha
chuckled
the
jew
rubbing
his
hands
could
have
happened
better
if
we
had
chosen
our
time
course
it
could
replied
sikes
know
that
directly
i
see
him
coming
through
clerkenwell
with
the
books
under
his
arm
it
all
right
enough
they
or
they
have
taken
him
in
at
all
and
they
ask
no
questions
after
him
fear
they
should
be
obliged
to
prosecute
and
so
get
him
lagged
he
safe
enough
oliver
had
looked
from
one
to
the
other
while
these
words
were
being
spoken
as
if
he
were
bewildered
and
could
scarecely
understand
what
passed
but
when
bill
sikes
concluded
he
jumped
suddenly
to
his
feet
and
tore
wildly
from
the
room
uttering
shrieks
for
help
which
made
the
bare
old
house
echo
to
the
roof
back
the
dog
bill
cried
nancy
springing
before
the
door
and
closing
it
as
the
jew
and
his
two
pupils
darted
out
in
pursuit
back
the
dog
he
tear
the
boy
to
pieces
him
right
cried
sikes
struggling
to
disengage
himself
from
the
girl
grasp
off
from
me
or
i
split
your
head
against
the
wall
do
care
for
that
bill
i
do
care
for
that
screamed
the
girl
struggling
violently
with
the
man
child
sha
be
torn
down
by
the
dog
unless
you
kill
me
first
he
said
sikes
setting
his
teeth
soon
do
that
if
you
do
keep
off
the
housebreaker
flung
the
girl
from
him
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
just
as
the
jew
and
the
two
boys
returned
dragging
oliver
among
them
the
matter
here
said
fagin
looking
round
girl
gone
mad
i
think
replied
sikes
savagely
she
has
said
nancy
pale
and
breathless
from
the
scuffle
she
has
fagin
do
think
it
keep
quiet
will
you
said
the
jew
with
a
threatening
look
i
wo
do
that
neither
replied
nancy
speaking
very
loud
what
do
you
think
of
that
fagin
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
that
particular
species
of
humanity
to
which
nancy
belonged
to
feel
tolerably
certain
that
it
would
be
rather
unsafe
to
prolong
any
conversation
with
her
at
present
with
the
view
of
diverting
the
attention
of
the
company
he
turned
to
oliver
you
wanted
to
get
away
my
dear
did
you
said
the
jew
taking
up
a
jagged
and
knotted
club
which
law
in
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
oliver
made
no
reply
but
he
watched
the
jew
motions
and
breathed
quickly
to
get
assistance
called
for
the
police
did
you
sneered
the
jew
catching
the
boy
by
the
arm
cure
you
of
that
my
young
master
the
jew
inflicted
a
smart
blow
on
oliver
shoulders
with
the
club
and
was
raising
it
for
a
second
when
the
girl
rushing
forward
wrested
it
from
his
hand
she
flung
it
into
the
fire
with
a
force
that
brought
some
of
the
glowing
coals
whirling
out
into
the
room
wo
stand
by
and
see
it
done
fagin
cried
the
girl
got
the
boy
and
what
more
would
you
have
let
him
be
let
him
be
or
i
shall
put
that
mark
on
some
of
you
that
will
bring
me
to
the
gallows
before
my
time
the
girl
stamped
her
foot
violently
on
the
floor
as
she
vented
this
threat
and
with
her
lips
compressed
and
her
hands
clenched
looked
alternately
at
the
jew
and
the
other
robber
her
face
quite
colourless
from
the
passion
of
rage
into
which
she
had
gradually
worked
herself
nancy
said
the
jew
in
a
soothing
tone
after
a
pause
during
which
he
and
sikes
had
stared
at
one
another
in
a
disconcerted
manner
you
more
clever
than
ever
ha
ha
my
dear
you
are
acting
beautifully
i
said
the
girl
care
i
do
overdo
it
you
will
be
the
worse
for
it
fagin
if
i
do
and
so
i
tell
you
in
good
time
to
keep
clear
of
me
there
is
something
about
a
roused
woman
especially
if
she
add
to
all
her
other
strong
passions
the
fierce
impulses
of
recklessness
and
despair
which
few
men
like
to
provoke
the
jew
saw
that
it
would
be
hopeless
to
affect
any
further
mistake
regarding
the
reality
of
miss
nancy
rage
and
shrinking
involuntarily
back
a
few
paces
cast
a
glance
half
imploring
and
half
cowardly
at
sikes
as
if
to
hint
that
he
was
the
fittest
person
to
pursue
the
dialogue
sikes
thus
mutely
appealed
to
and
possibly
feeling
his
personal
pride
and
influence
interested
in
the
immediate
reduction
of
miss
nancy
to
reason
gave
utterance
to
about
a
couple
of
score
of
curses
and
threats
the
rapid
production
of
which
reflected
great
credit
on
the
fertility
of
his
invention
as
they
produced
no
visible
effect
on
the
object
against
whom
they
were
discharged
however
he
resorted
to
more
tangible
arguments
do
you
mean
by
this
said
sikes
backing
the
inquiry
with
a
very
common
imprecation
concerning
the
most
beautiful
of
human
features
which
if
it
were
heard
above
only
once
out
of
every
fifty
thousand
times
that
it
is
uttered
below
would
render
blindness
as
common
a
disorder
as
measles
do
you
mean
by
it
burn
my
body
do
you
know
who
you
are
and
what
you
are
yes
i
know
all
about
it
replied
the
girl
laughing
hysterically
and
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
with
a
poor
assumption
of
indifference
then
keep
quiet
rejoined
sikes
with
a
growl
like
that
he
was
accustomed
to
use
when
addressing
his
dog
i
quiet
you
for
a
good
long
time
to
come
the
girl
laughed
again
even
less
composedly
than
before
and
darting
a
hasty
look
at
sikes
turned
her
face
aside
and
bit
her
lip
till
the
blood
came
a
nice
one
added
sikes
as
he
surveyed
her
with
a
contemptuous
air
take
up
the
humane
and
gen
teel
side
a
pretty
subject
for
the
child
as
you
call
him
to
make
a
friend
of
almighty
help
me
i
am
cried
the
girl
passionately
i
wish
i
had
been
struck
dead
in
the
street
or
had
changed
places
with
them
we
passed
so
near
before
i
had
lent
a
hand
in
bringing
him
here
he
a
thief
a
liar
a
devil
all
that
bad
from
this
night
forth
is
that
enough
for
the
old
wretch
without
blows
come
sikes
said
the
jew
appealing
to
him
in
a
remonstratory
tone
and
motioning
towards
the
boys
who

civil

the

whose
passion
was
frightful
to
see

you
villain
yes
you
deserve

me

thieved
for
you
when
i
was

as
old

this
pointing

been
in
the

trade
and
in
the
same
service
for
twelve
years
since
do
you
know
it

out
do
you
know
it
well
replied
the
jew
with
an
attempt
at
pacification
if
you
have
it
your
living
it
is
returned
the
girl
not
speaking
but
pouring
out
the
words
in
one
continuous
and
vehement
scream
is
my
living
and
the
cold
wet
dirty
streets
are
my
home
and
you
the
wretch
that
drove
me
to
them
long
ago
and
that
keep
me
there
day
and
night
day
and
night
till
i
die
shall
do
you
a
mischief
interposed
the
jew
goaded
by
these
reproaches
mischief
worse
than
that
if
you
say
much
more
the
girl
said
nothing
more
but
tearing
her
hair
and
dress
in
a
transport
of
passion
made
such
a
rush
at
the
jew
as
would
probably
have
left
signal
marks
of
her
revenge
upon
him
had
not
her
wrists
been
seized
by
sikes
at
the
right
moment
upon
which
she
made
a
few
ineffectual
struggles
and
fainted
all
right
now
said
sikes
laying
her
down
in
a
corner
uncommon
strong
in
the
arms
when
she
up
in
this
way
the
jew
wiped
his
forehead
and
smiled
as
if
it
were
a
relief
to
have
the
disturbance
over
but
neither
he
nor
sikes
nor
the
dog
nor
the
boys
seemed
to
consider
it
in
any
other
light
than
a
common
occurance
incidental
to
business
the
worst
of
having
to
do
with
women
said
the
jew
replacing
his
club
they
clever
and
we
ca
get
on
in
our
line
without
charley
show
oliver
to
bed
suppose
he
better
not
wear
his
best
clothes
tomorrow
fagin
had
he
inquired
charley
bates
not
replied
the
jew
reciprocating
the
grin
with
which
charley
put
the
question
master
bates
apparently
much
delighted
with
his
commission
took
the
cleft
stick
and
led
oliver
into
an
adjacent
kitchen
where
there
were
two
or
three
of
the
beds
on
which
he
had
slept
before
and
here
with
many
uncontrollable
bursts
of
laughter
he
produced
the
identical
old
suit
of
clothes
which
oliver
had
so
much
congratulated
himself
upon
leaving
off
at
brownlow
and
the
accidental
display
of
which
to
fagin
by
the
jew
who
purchased
them
had
been
the
very
first
clue
received
of
his
whereabout
off
the
smart
ones
said
charley
i
give
to
fagin
to
take
care
of
what
fun
it
is
poor
oliver
unwillingly
complied
master
bates
rolling
up
the
new
clothes
under
his
arm
departed
from
the
room
leaving
oliver
in
the
dark
and
locking
the
door
behind
him
the
noise
of
charley
laughter
and
the
voice
of
miss
betsy
who
opportunely
arrived
to
throw
water
over
her
friend
and
perform
other
feminine
offices
for
the
promotion
of
her
recovery
might
have
kept
many
people
awake
under
more
happy
circumstances
than
those
in
which
oliver
was
placed
but
he
was
sick
and
weary
and
he
soon
fell
sound
asleep
chapter
xvii
oliver
destiny
continuing
unpropitious
brings
a
great
man
to
london
to
injure
his
reputation
it
is
the
custom
on
the
stage
in
all
good
murderous
melodramas
to
present
the
tragic
and
the
comic
scenes
in
as
regular
alternation
as
the
layers
of
red
and
white
in
a
side
of
streaky
bacon
the
hero
sinks
upon
his
straw
bed
weighed
down
by
fetters
and
misfortunes
in
the
next
scene
his
faithful
but
unconscious
squire
regales
the
audience
with
a
comic
song
we
behold
with
throbbing
bosoms
the
heroine
in
the
grasp
of
a
proud
and
ruthless
baron
her
virtue
and
her
life
alike
in
danger
drawing
forth
her
dagger
to
preserve
the
one
at
the
cost
of
the
other
and
just
as
our
expectations
are
wrought
up
to
the
highest
pitch
a
whistle
is
heard
and
we
are
straightway
transported
to
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
where
a
seneschal
sings
a
funny
chorus
with
a
funnier
body
of
vassals
who
are
free
of
all
sorts
of
places
from
church
vaults
to
palaces
and
roam
about
in
company
carolling
perpetually
such
changes
appear
absurd
but
they
are
not
so
unnatural
as
they
would
seem
at
first
sight
the
transitions
in
real
life
from
boards
to
and
from
to
holiday
garments
are
not
a
whit
less
startling
only
there
we
are
busy
actors
instead
of
passive
which
makes
a
vast
difference
the
actors
in
the
mimic
life
of
the
theatre
are
blind
to
violent
transitions
and
abrupt
impulses
of
passion
or
feeling
which
presented
before
the
eyes
of
mere
spectators
are
at
once
condemned
as
outrageous
and
preposterous
as
sudden
shiftings
of
the
scene
and
rapid
changes
of
time
and
place
are
not
only
sanctioned
in
books
by
long
usage
but
are
by
many
considered
as
the
great
art
of
authorship
an
author
skill
in
his
craft
being
by
such
critics
chiefly
estimated
with
relation
to
the
dilemmas
in
which
he
leaves
his
characters
at
the
end
of
every
chapter
this
brief
introduction
to
the
present
one
may
perhaps
be
deemed
unnecessary
if
so
let
it
be
considered
a
delicate
intimation
on
the
part
of
the
historian
that
he
is
going
back
to
the
town
in
which
oliver
twist
was
born
the
reader
taking
it
for
granted
that
there
are
good
and
substantial
reasons
for
making
the
journey
or
he
would
not
be
invited
to
proceed
upon
such
an
expedition
bumble
emerged
at
early
morning
from
the
and
walked
with
portly
carriage
and
commanding
steps
up
the
high
street
he
was
in
the
full
bloom
and
pride
of
beadlehood
his
cocked
hat
and
coat
were
dazzling
in
the
morning
sun
he
clutched
his
cane
with
the
vigorous
tenacity
of
health
and
power
bumble
always
carried
his
head
high
but
this
morning
it
was
higher
than
usual
there
was
an
abstraction
in
his
eye
an
elevation
in
his
air
which
might
have
warned
an
observant
stranger
that
thoughts
were
passing
in
the
beadle
mind
too
great
for
utterance
bumble
stopped
not
to
converse
with
the
small
shopkeepers
and
others
who
spoke
to
him
deferentially
as
he
passed
along
he
merely
returned
their
salutations
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
relaxed
not
in
his
dignified
pace
until
he
reached
the
farm
where
mann
tended
the
infant
paupers
with
parochial
care
that
beadle
said
mann
hearing
the
shaking
at
the
it
is
him
at
this
time
in
the
morning
lauk
bumble
only
think
of
its
being
you
well
dear
me
it
is
a
pleasure
this
is
come
into
the
parlour
sir
please
the
first
sentence
was
addressed
to
susan
and
the
exclamations
of
delight
were
uttered
to
bumble
as
the
good
lady
unlocked
the
and
showed
him
with
great
attention
and
respect
into
the
house
mann
said
bumble
not
sitting
upon
or
dropping
himself
into
a
seat
as
any
common
jackanapes
would
but
letting
himself
gradually
and
slowly
down
into
a
chair
mann
good
morning
and
good
morning
to
sir
replied
mann
with
many
smiles
hoping
you
find
yourself
well
sir
mann
replied
the
beadle
porochial
life
is
not
a
bed
of
roses
mrs
mann
that
it
is
indeed
bumble
rejoined
the
lady
and
all
the
infant
paupers
might
have
chorussed
the
rejoinder
with
great
propriety
if
they
had
heard
it
porochial
life
continued
bumble
striking
the
table
with
his
cane
a
life
of
worrit
and
vexation
and
hardihood
but
all
public
characters
as
i
may
say
must
suffer
prosecution
mann
not
very
well
knowing
what
the
beadle
meant
raised
her
hands
with
a
look
of
sympathy
and
sighed
you
may
well
sigh
mrs
mann
said
the
beadle
finding
she
had
done
right
mann
sighed
again
evidently
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
public
character
who
repressing
a
complacent
smile
by
looking
sternly
at
his
cocked
hat
said
mann
i
am
going
to
london
mr
bumble
cried
mann
starting
back
london
resumed
the
inflexible
beadle
coach
i
and
two
paupers
mann
a
legal
action
is
a
coming
on
about
a
settlement
and
the
board
has
appointed
me
me
mann
to
dispose
to
the
matter
before
the
at
clerkinwell
and
i
very
much
question
added
bumble
drawing
himself
up
the
clerkinwell
sessions
will
not
find
themselves
in
the
wrong
box
before
they
have
done
with
me
you
must
be
too
hard
upon
them
sir
said
mann
coaxingly
clerkinwell
sessions
have
brought
it
upon
themselves
replied
bumble
if
the
clerkinwell
sessions
find
that
they
come
off
rather
worse
than
they
expected
the
clerkinwell
sessions
have
only
themselves
to
thank
there
was
so
much
determination
and
depth
of
purpose
about
the
menacing
manner
in
which
bumble
delivered
himself
of
these
words
that
mann
appeared
quite
awed
by
them
at
length
she
said
going
by
coach
sir
i
thought
it
was
always
usual
to
send
them
paupers
in
carts
when
they
ill
mann
said
the
beadle
put
the
sick
paupers
into
open
carts
in
the
rainy
weather
to
prevent
their
taking
cold
said
mann
opposition
coach
contracts
for
these
two
and
takes
them
cheap
said
bumble
are
both
in
a
very
low
state
and
we
find
it
would
come
two
pound
cheaper
to
move
than
to
bury
that
is
if
we
can
throw
upon
another
parish
which
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
do
if
they
do
die
upon
the
road
to
spite
us
ha
ha
ha
when
bumble
had
laughed
a
little
while
his
eyes
again
encountered
the
cocked
hat
and
he
became
grave
are
forgetting
business
said
the
beadle
is
your
porochial
stipend
for
the
month
bumble
produced
some
silver
money
rolled
up
in
paper
from
his
and
requested
a
receipt
which
mann
wrote
very
much
blotted
sir
said
the
farmer
of
infants
formal
enough
i
dare
say
thank
you
bumble
sir
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
sure
bumble
nodded
blandly
in
acknowledgment
of
mann
curtsey
and
inquired
how
the
children
were
their
dear
little
hearts
said
mann
with
emotion
as
well
as
can
be
the
dears
of
course
except
the
two
that
died
last
week
and
little
dick
that
boy
no
better
inquired
bumble
mann
shook
her
head
a
wicious
porochial
child
that
said
bumble
angrily
is
he
bring
him
to
you
in
one
minute
sir
replied
mann
you
dick
after
some
calling
dick
was
discovered
having
had
his
face
put
under
the
pump
and
dried
upon
mann
gown
he
was
led
into
the
awful
presence
of
bumble
the
beadle
the
child
was
pale
and
thin
his
cheeks
were
sunken
and
his
eyes
large
and
bright
the
scanty
parish
dress
the
livery
of
his
misery
hung
loosely
on
his
feeble
body
and
his
young
limbs
had
wasted
away
like
those
of
an
old
man
such
was
the
little
being
who
stood
trembling
beneath
glance
not
daring
to
lift
his
eyes
from
the
floor
and
dreading
even
to
hear
the
beadle
voice
you
look
at
the
gentleman
you
obstinate
boy
said
mann
the
child
meekly
raised
his
eyes
and
encountered
those
of
bumble
the
matter
with
you
porochial
dick
inquired
bumble
with
jocularity
sir
replied
the
child
faintly
should
think
not
said
mann
who
had
of
course
laughed
very
much
at
bumble
humour
want
for
nothing
i
sure
should
like
faltered
the
child
interposed
mann
suppose
you
going
to
say
that
you
do
want
for
something
now
why
you
little
wretch
mann
stop
said
the
beadle
raising
his
hand
with
a
show
of
authority
what
sir
eh
should
like
faltered
the
child
somebody
that
can
write
would
put
a
few
words
down
for
me
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
fold
it
up
and
seal
it
and
keep
it
for
me
after
i
am
laid
in
the
ground
what
does
the
boy
mean
exclaimed
bumble
on
whom
the
earnest
manner
and
wan
aspect
of
the
child
had
made
some
impression
accustomed
as
he
was
to
such
things
do
you
mean
sir
should
like
said
the
child
leave
my
dear
love
to
poor
oliver
twist
and
to
let
him
know
how
often
i
have
sat
by
myself
and
cried
to
think
of
his
wandering
about
in
the
dark
nights
with
nobody
to
help
him
and
i
should
like
to
tell
him
said
the
child
pressing
his
small
hands
together
and
speaking
with
great
fervour
i
was
glad
to
die
when
i
was
very
young
for
perhaps
if
i
had
lived
to
be
a
man
and
had
grown
old
my
little
sister
who
is
in
heaven
might
forget
me
or
be
unlike
me
and
it
would
be
so
much
happier
if
we
were
both
children
there
together
bumble
surveyed
the
little
speaker
from
head
to
foot
with
indescribable
astonishment
and
turning
to
his
companion
said
all
in
one
story
mann
that
oliver
had
demogalized
them
all
could
have
believed
it
sir
said
mrs
mann
holding
up
her
hands
and
looking
malignantly
at
dick
never
see
such
a
hardened
little
wretch
him
away
said
bumble
imperiously
must
be
stated
to
the
board
mann
hope
the
gentleman
will
understand
that
it
is
my
fault
sir
said
mann
whimpering
pathetically
shall
understand
that
they
shall
be
acquainted
with
the
true
state
of
the
case
said
bumble
take
him
away
i
ca
bear
the
sight
on
him
dick
was
immediately
taken
away
and
locked
up
in
the
bumble
shortly
afterwards
took
himself
off
to
prepare
for
his
journey
at
six
next
morning
bumble
having
exchanged
his
cocked
hat
for
a
round
one
and
encased
his
person
in
a
blue
with
a
cape
to
it
took
his
place
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
accompanied
by
the
criminals
whose
settlement
was
disputed
with
whom
in
due
course
of
time
he
arrived
in
london
he
experienced
no
other
crosses
on
the
way
than
those
which
originated
in
the
perverse
behaviour
of
the
two
paupers
who
persisted
in
shivering
and
complaining
of
the
cold
in
a
manner
which
bumble
declared
caused
his
teeth
to
chatter
in
his
head
and
made
him
feel
quite
uncomfortable
although
he
had
a
on
having
disposed
of
these
persons
for
the
night
bumble
sat
himself
down
in
the
house
at
which
the
coach
stopped
and
took
a
temperate
dinner
of
steaks
oyster
sauce
and
porter
putting
a
glass
of
hot
on
the
he
drew
his
chair
to
the
fire
and
with
sundry
moral
reflections
on
the
sin
of
discontent
and
complaining
composed
himself
to
read
the
paper
the
very
first
paragraph
upon
which
bumble
eye
rested
was
the
following
advertisement
guineas
reward
a
young
boy
named
oliver
twist
absconded
or
was
enticed
on
thursday
evening
last
from
his
home
at
pentonville
and
has
not
since
been
heard
of
the
above
reward
will
be
paid
to
any
person
who
will
give
such
information
as
will
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
said
oliver
twist
or
tend
to
throw
any
light
upon
his
previous
history
in
which
the
advertiser
is
for
many
reasons
warmly
interested
and
then
followed
a
full
description
of
oliver
dress
person
appearance
and
disappearance
with
the
name
and
address
of
brownlow
at
full
length
bumble
opened
his
eyes
read
the
advertisement
slowly
and
carefully
three
several
times
and
in
something
more
than
five
minutes
was
on
his
way
to
pentonville
having
actually
in
his
excitement
left
the
glass
of
hot
untasted
brownlow
at
home
inquired
bumble
of
the
girl
who
opened
the
door
to
this
inquiry
the
girl
returned
the
not
uncommon
but
rather
evasive
reply
of
do
know
where
do
you
come
from
bumble
no
sooner
uttered
oliver
name
in
explanation
of
his
errand
than
bedwin
who
had
been
listening
at
the
parlour
door
hastened
into
the
passage
in
a
breathless
state
in
come
in
said
the
old
lady
knew
we
should
hear
of
him
poor
dear
i
knew
we
should
i
was
certain
of
it
bless
his
heart
i
said
so
all
along
having
heard
this
the
worthy
old
lady
hurried
back
into
the
parlour
again
and
seating
herself
on
a
sofa
burst
into
tears
the
girl
who
was
not
quite
so
susceptible
had
run
upstairs
meanwhile
and
now
returned
with
a
request
that
bumble
would
follow
her
immediately
which
he
did
he
was
shown
into
the
little
back
study
where
sat
brownlow
and
his
friend
grimwig
with
decanters
and
glasses
before
them
the
latter
gentleman
at
once
burst
into
the
exclamation
beadle
a
parish
beadle
or
i
eat
my
head
do
interrupt
just
now
said
brownlow
a
seat
will
you
bumble
sat
himself
down
quite
confounded
by
the
oddity
of
grimwig
manner
brownlow
moved
the
lamp
so
as
to
obtain
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
beadle
countenance
and
said
with
a
little
impatience
sir
you
come
in
consequence
of
having
seen
the
advertisement
sir
said
bumble
you
are
a
beadle
are
you
not
inquired
grimwig
am
a
porochial
beadle
gentlemen
rejoined
bumble
proudly
course
observed
grimwig
aside
to
his
friend
knew
he
was
a
beadle
all
over
brownlow
gently
shook
his
head
to
impose
silence
on
his
friend
and
resumed
you
know
where
this
poor
boy
is
now
more
than
nobody
replied
bumble
what
do
you
know
of
him
inquired
the
old
gentleman
out
my
friend
if
you
have
anything
to
say
what
do
you
know
of
him
do
happen
to
know
any
good
of
him
do
you
said
grimwig
caustically
after
an
attentive
perusal
of
bumble
features
bumble
catching
at
the
inquiry
very
quickly
shook
his
head
with
portentous
solemnity
see
said
grimwig
looking
triumphantly
at
brownlow
brownlow
looked
apprehensively
at
bumble
countenance
and
requested
him
to
communicate
what
he
knew
regarding
oliver
in
as
few
words
as
possible
bumble
put
down
his
hat
unbuttoned
his
coat
folded
his
arms
inclined
his
head
in
a
retrospective
manner
and
after
a
few
reflection
commenced
his
story
it
would
be
tedious
if
given
in
the
beadle
words
occupying
as
it
did
some
twenty
minutes
in
the
telling
but
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
was
that
oliver
was
a
foundling
born
of
low
and
vicious
parents
that
he
had
from
his
birth
displayed
no
better
qualities
than
treachery
ingratitude
and
malice
that
he
had
terminated
his
brief
career
in
the
place
of
his
birth
by
making
a
sanguinary
and
cowardly
attack
on
an
unoffending
lad
and
running
away
in
the
from
his
master
house
in
proof
of
his
really
being
the
person
he
represented
himself
bumble
laid
upon
the
table
the
papers
he
had
brought
to
town
folding
his
arms
again
he
then
awaited
observations
fear
it
is
all
too
true
said
the
old
gentleman
sorrowfully
after
looking
over
the
papers
is
not
much
for
your
intelligence
but
i
would
gladly
have
given
you
treble
the
money
if
it
had
been
favourable
to
the
boy
it
is
not
improbable
that
if
bumble
had
been
possessed
of
this
information
at
an
earlier
period
of
the
interview
he
might
have
imparted
a
very
different
colouring
to
his
little
history
it
was
too
late
to
do
it
now
however
so
he
shook
his
head
gravely
and
pocketing
the
five
guineas
withdrew
brownlow
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
for
some
minutes
evidently
so
much
disturbed
by
the
beadle
tale
that
even
grimwig
forbore
to
vex
him
further
at
length
he
stopped
and
rang
the
bell
violently
bedwin
said
brownlow
when
the
housekeeper
appeared
boy
oliver
is
an
imposter
ca
be
sir
it
can
not
be
said
the
old
lady
energetically
tell
you
he
is
retorted
the
old
gentleman
do
you
mean
by
ca
be
we
have
just
heard
a
full
account
of
him
from
his
birth
and
he
has
been
a
little
villain
all
his
life
never
will
believe
it
sir
replied
the
old
lady
firmly
old
women
never
believe
anything
but
and
lying
growled
grimwig
knew
it
all
along
why
you
take
my
advise
in
the
beginning
you
would
if
he
had
had
a
fever
i
suppose
eh
he
was
interesting
was
he
interesting
bah
and
grimwig
poked
the
fire
with
a
flourish
was
a
dear
grateful
gentle
child
sir
retorted
bedwin
indignantly
know
what
children
are
sir
and
have
done
these
forty
years
and
people
who
ca
say
the
same
should
say
anything
about
them
that
my
opinion
this
was
a
hard
hit
at
grimwig
who
was
a
bachelor
as
it
extorted
nothing
from
that
gentleman
but
a
smile
the
old
lady
tossed
her
head
and
smoothed
down
her
apron
preparatory
to
another
speech
when
she
was
stopped
by
brownlow
said
the
old
gentleman
feigning
an
anger
he
was
far
from
feeling
let
me
hear
the
boy
name
again
i
rang
to
tell
you
that
never
never
on
any
pretence
mind
you
may
leave
the
room
bedwin
remember
i
am
in
earnest
there
were
sad
hearts
at
brownlow
that
night
oliver
heart
sank
within
him
when
he
thought
of
his
good
friends
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
could
not
know
what
they
had
heard
or
it
might
have
broken
outright
chapter
xviii
how
oliver
passed
his
time
in
the
improving
society
of
his
reputable
friends
about
noon
next
day
when
the
dodger
and
master
bates
had
gone
out
to
pursue
their
customary
avocations
fagin
took
the
opportunity
of
reading
oliver
a
long
lecture
on
the
crying
sin
of
ingratitude
of
which
he
clearly
demonstrated
he
had
been
guilty
to
no
ordinary
extent
in
wilfully
absenting
himself
from
the
society
of
his
anxious
friends
and
still
more
in
endeavouring
to
escape
from
them
after
so
much
trouble
and
expense
had
been
incurred
in
his
recovery
fagin
laid
great
stress
on
the
fact
of
his
having
taken
oliver
in
and
cherished
him
when
without
his
timely
aid
he
might
have
perished
with
hunger
and
he
related
the
dismal
and
affecting
history
of
a
young
lad
whom
in
his
philanthropy
he
had
succoured
under
parallel
circumstances
but
who
proving
unworthy
of
his
confidence
and
evincing
a
desire
to
communicate
with
the
police
had
unfortunately
come
to
be
hanged
at
the
old
bailey
one
morning
fagin
did
not
seek
to
conceal
his
share
in
the
catastrophe
but
lamented
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
the
and
treacherous
behaviour
of
the
young
person
in
question
had
rendered
it
necessary
that
he
should
become
the
victim
of
certain
evidence
for
the
crown
which
if
it
were
not
precisely
true
was
indispensably
necessary
for
the
safety
of
him
fagin
and
a
few
select
friends
fagin
concluded
by
drawing
a
rather
disagreeable
picture
of
the
discomforts
of
hanging
and
with
great
friendliness
and
politeness
of
manner
expressed
his
anxious
hopes
that
he
might
never
be
obliged
to
submit
oliver
twist
to
that
unpleasant
operation
little
oliver
blood
ran
cold
as
he
listened
to
the
jew
words
and
imperfectly
comprehended
the
dark
threats
conveyed
in
them
that
it
was
possible
even
for
justice
itself
to
confound
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
when
they
were
in
accidental
companionship
he
knew
already
and
that
plans
for
the
destruction
of
inconveniently
knowing
or
persons
had
been
really
devised
and
carried
out
by
the
jew
on
more
occasions
than
one
he
thought
by
no
means
unlikely
when
he
recollected
the
general
nature
of
the
altercations
between
that
gentleman
and
sikes
which
seemed
to
bear
reference
to
some
foregone
conspiracy
of
the
kind
as
he
glanced
timidly
up
and
met
the
jew
searching
look
he
felt
that
his
pale
face
and
trembling
limbs
were
neither
unnoticed
nor
unrelished
by
that
wary
old
gentleman
the
jew
smiling
hideously
patted
oliver
on
the
head
and
said
that
if
he
kept
himself
quiet
and
applied
himself
to
business
he
saw
they
would
be
very
good
friends
yet
then
taking
his
hat
and
covering
himself
with
an
old
patched
he
went
out
and
locked
the
behind
him
and
so
oliver
remained
all
that
day
and
for
the
greater
part
of
many
subsequent
days
seeing
nobody
between
early
morning
and
midnight
and
left
during
the
long
hours
to
commune
with
his
own
thoughts
which
never
failing
to
revert
to
his
kind
friends
and
the
opinion
they
must
long
ago
have
formed
of
him
were
sad
indeed
after
the
lapse
of
a
week
or
so
the
jew
left
the
unlocked
and
he
was
at
liberty
to
wander
about
the
house
it
was
a
very
dirty
place
the
rooms
upstairs
had
great
high
wooden
and
large
doors
with
panelled
walls
and
cornices
to
the
ceiling
which
although
they
were
black
with
neglect
and
dust
were
ornamented
in
various
ways
from
all
of
these
tokens
oliver
concluded
that
a
long
time
ago
before
the
old
jew
was
born
it
had
belonged
to
better
people
and
had
perhaps
been
quite
gay
and
handsome
dismal
and
dreary
as
it
looked
now
spiders
had
built
their
webs
in
the
angles
of
the
walls
and
ceilings
and
sometimes
when
oliver
walked
softly
into
a
room
the
mice
would
scamper
across
the
floor
and
run
back
terrified
to
their
holes
with
these
exceptions
there
was
neither
sight
nor
sound
of
any
living
thing
and
often
when
it
grew
dark
and
he
was
tired
of
wandering
from
room
to
room
he
would
crouch
in
the
corner
of
the
passage
by
the
to
be
as
near
living
people
as
he
could
and
would
remain
there
listening
and
counting
the
hours
until
the
jew
or
the
boys
returned
in
all
the
rooms
the
mouldering
shutters
were
fast
closed
the
bars
which
held
them
were
screwed
tight
into
the
wood
the
only
light
which
was
admitted
stealing
its
way
through
round
holes
at
the
top
which
made
the
rooms
more
gloomy
and
filled
them
with
strange
shadows
there
was
a
window
with
rusty
bars
outside
which
had
no
shutter
and
out
of
this
oliver
often
gazed
with
a
melancholy
face
for
hours
together
but
nothing
was
to
be
descried
from
it
but
a
confused
and
crowded
mass
of
housetops
blackened
chimneys
and
sometimes
indeed
a
grizzly
head
might
be
seen
peering
over
the
of
a
distant
house
but
it
was
quickly
withdrawn
again
and
as
the
window
of
oliver
observatory
was
nailed
down
and
dimmed
with
the
rain
and
smoke
of
years
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
make
out
the
forms
of
the
different
objects
beyond
without
making
any
attempt
to
be
seen
or
heard
which
he
had
as
much
chance
of
being
as
if
he
had
lived
inside
the
ball
of
paul
cathedral
one
afternoon
the
dodger
and
master
bates
being
engaged
out
that
evening
the
young
gentleman
took
it
into
his
head
to
evince
some
anxiety
regarding
the
decoration
of
his
person
to
do
him
justice
this
was
by
no
means
an
habitual
weakness
with
him
and
with
this
end
and
aim
he
condescendingly
commanded
oliver
to
assist
him
in
his
toilet
straightway
oliver
was
but
too
glad
to
make
himself
useful
too
happy
to
have
some
faces
however
bad
to
look
upon
too
desirous
to
conciliate
those
about
him
when
he
could
honestly
do
so
to
throw
any
objection
in
the
way
of
this
proposal
so
he
at
once
expressed
his
readiness
and
kneeling
on
the
floor
while
the
dodger
sat
upon
the
table
so
that
he
could
take
his
foot
in
his
laps
he
applied
himself
to
a
process
which
dawkins
designated
as
his
the
phrase
rendered
into
plain
english
signifieth
cleaning
his
boots
whether
it
was
the
sense
of
freedom
and
independence
which
a
rational
animal
may
be
supposed
to
feel
when
he
sits
on
a
table
in
an
easy
attitude
smoking
a
pipe
swinging
one
leg
carelessly
to
and
fro
and
having
his
boots
cleaned
all
the
time
without
even
the
past
trouble
of
having
taken
them
off
or
the
prospective
misery
of
putting
them
on
to
disturb
his
reflections
or
whether
it
was
the
goodness
of
the
tobacco
that
soothed
the
feelings
of
the
dodger
or
the
mildness
of
the
beer
that
mollified
his
thoughts
he
was
evidently
tinctured
for
the
nonce
with
a
spice
of
romance
and
enthusiasm
foreign
to
his
general
nature
he
looked
down
on
oliver
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
for
a
brief
space
and
then
raising
his
head
and
heaving
a
gentle
sign
said
half
in
abstraction
and
half
to
master
bates
a
pity
it
is
he
is
a
prig
said
master
charles
bates
do
know
what
good
for
him
the
dodger
sighed
again
and
resumed
his
pipe
as
did
charley
bates
they
both
smoked
for
some
seconds
in
silence
suppose
you
do
even
know
what
a
prig
is
said
the
dodger
mournfully
think
i
know
that
replied
oliver
looking
up
a
the
you
one
are
you
not
inquired
oliver
checking
himself
am
replied
the
dodger
scorn
to
be
anything
else
dawkins
gave
his
hat
a
ferocious
cock
after
delivering
this
sentiment
and
looked
at
master
bates
as
if
to
denote
that
he
would
feel
obliged
by
his
saying
anything
to
the
contrary
am
repeated
the
dodger
charley
so
fagin
so
sikes
so
nancy
so
bet
so
we
all
are
down
to
the
dog
and
he
the
downiest
one
of
the
lot
the
least
given
to
peaching
added
charley
bates
would
so
much
as
bark
in
a
for
fear
of
committing
himself
no
not
if
you
tied
him
up
in
one
and
left
him
there
without
wittles
for
a
fortnight
said
the
dodger
a
bit
of
it
observed
charley
a
rum
dog
do
he
look
fierce
at
any
strange
cove
that
laughs
or
sings
when
he
in
company
pursued
the
dodger
he
growl
at
all
when
he
hears
a
fiddle
playing
and
do
he
hate
other
dogs
as
ai
of
his
breed
oh
no
an
christian
said
charley
this
was
merely
intended
as
a
tribute
to
the
animal
abilities
but
it
was
an
appropriate
remark
in
another
sense
if
master
bates
had
only
known
it
for
there
are
a
good
many
ladies
and
gentlemen
claiming
to
be
christians
between
whom
and
sikes
dog
there
exist
strong
and
singular
points
of
resemblance
well
said
the
dodger
recurring
to
the
point
from
which
they
had
strayed
with
that
mindfulness
of
his
profession
which
influenced
all
his
proceedings
has
go
anything
to
do
with
young
green
here
more
it
has
said
charley
do
you
put
yourself
under
fagin
oliver
make
your
fortun
out
of
hand
added
the
dodger
with
a
grin
so
be
able
to
retire
on
your
property
and
do
the
as
i
mean
to
in
the
very
next
but
four
that
ever
comes
and
the
tuesday
in
said
charley
bates
do
like
it
rejoined
oliver
timidly
wish
they
would
let
me
go
i
i
would
rather
go
fagin
would
rather
not
rejoined
charley
oliver
knew
this
too
well
but
thinking
it
might
be
dangerous
to
express
his
feelings
more
openly
he
only
sighed
and
went
on
with
his
exclaimed
the
dodger
where
your
spirit
do
you
take
any
pride
out
of
yourself
would
you
go
and
be
dependent
on
your
friends
blow
that
said
master
bates
drawing
two
or
three
silk
handkerchiefs
from
his
pocket
and
tossing
them
into
a
cupboard
too
mean
that
is
could
do
it
said
the
dodger
with
an
air
of
haughty
disgust
can
leave
your
friends
though
said
oliver
with
a
half
smile
let
them
be
punished
for
what
you
did
rejoined
the
dodger
with
a
wave
of
his
pipe
was
all
out
of
consideration
for
fagin
the
traps
know
that
we
work
together
and
he
might
have
got
into
trouble
if
we
had
made
our
lucky
that
was
the
move
was
it
charley
master
bates
nodded
assent
and
would
have
spoken
but
the
recollection
of
oliver
flight
came
so
suddenly
upon
him
that
the
smoke
he
was
inhaling
got
entangled
with
a
laugh
and
went
up
into
his
head
and
down
into
his
throat
and
brought
on
a
fit
of
coughing
and
stamping
about
five
minutes
long
here
said
the
dodger
drawing
forth
a
handful
of
shillings
and
halfpence
a
jolly
life
what
the
odds
where
it
comes
from
here
catch
hold
there
plenty
more
where
they
were
took
from
you
wo
wo
you
oh
you
precious
flat
naughty
ai
it
oliver
inquired
charley
bates
come
to
be
scragged
wo
he
do
know
what
that
means
replied
oliver
in
this
way
old
feller
said
charly
as
he
said
it
master
bates
caught
up
an
end
of
his
neckerchief
and
holding
it
erect
in
the
air
dropped
his
head
on
his
shoulder
and
jerked
a
curious
sound
through
his
teeth
thereby
indicating
by
a
lively
pantomimic
representation
that
scragging
and
hanging
were
one
and
the
same
thing
what
it
means
said
charley
how
he
stares
jack
i
never
did
see
such
prime
company
as
that
boy
he
be
the
death
of
me
i
know
he
will
master
charley
bates
having
laughed
heartily
again
resumed
his
pipe
with
tears
in
his
eyes
been
brought
up
bad
said
the
dodger
surveying
his
boots
with
much
satisfaction
when
oliver
had
polished
them
will
make
something
of
you
though
or
you
be
the
first
he
ever
had
that
turned
out
unprofitable
you
better
begin
at
once
for
you
come
to
the
trade
long
before
you
think
of
it
and
you
only
losing
time
oliver
master
bates
backed
this
advice
with
sundry
moral
admonitions
of
his
own
which
being
exhausted
he
and
his
friend
dawkins
launched
into
a
glowing
description
of
the
numerous
pleasures
incidental
to
the
life
they
led
interspersed
with
a
variety
of
hints
to
oliver
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
secure
fagin
favour
without
more
delay
by
the
means
which
they
themselves
had
employed
to
gain
it
always
put
this
in
your
pipe
nolly
said
the
dodger
as
the
jew
was
heard
unlocking
the
door
above
you
do
take
fogels
and
tickers
the
good
of
talking
in
that
way
interposed
master
bates
do
know
what
you
mean
you
do
take
and
watches
said
the
dodger
reducing
his
conversation
to
the
level
of
oliver
capacity
other
cove
will
so
that
the
coves
that
lose
will
be
all
the
worse
and
you
be
all
the
worse
too
and
nobody
half
a
the
better
except
the
chaps
wot
gets
them
and
you
just
as
good
a
right
to
them
as
they
have
be
sure
to
be
sure
said
the
jew
who
had
entered
unseen
by
oliver
all
lies
in
a
nutshell
my
dear
in
a
nutshell
take
the
dodger
word
for
it
ha
ha
ha
he
understands
the
catechism
of
his
trade
the
old
man
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
together
as
he
corroborated
the
dodger
reasoning
in
these
terms
and
chuckled
with
delight
at
his
pupil
proficiency
the
conversation
proceeded
no
farther
at
this
time
for
the
jew
had
returned
home
accompanied
by
miss
betsy
and
a
gentleman
whom
oliver
had
never
seen
before
but
who
was
accosted
by
the
dodger
as
tom
chitling
and
who
having
lingered
on
the
stairs
to
exchange
a
few
gallantries
with
the
lady
now
made
his
appearance
chitling
was
older
in
years
than
the
dodger
having
perhaps
numbered
eighteen
winters
but
there
was
a
degree
of
deference
in
his
deportment
towards
that
young
gentleman
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
felt
himself
conscious
of
a
slight
inferiority
in
point
of
genius
and
professional
aquirements
he
had
small
twinkling
eyes
and
a
face
wore
a
fur
cap
a
dark
corduroy
jacket
greasy
fustian
trousers
and
an
apron
his
wardrobe
was
in
truth
rather
out
of
repair
but
he
excused
himself
to
the
company
by
stating
that
his
was
only
out
an
hour
before
and
that
in
consequence
of
having
worn
the
regimentals
for
six
weeks
past
he
had
not
been
able
to
bestow
any
attention
on
his
private
clothes
chitling
added
with
strong
marks
of
irritation
that
the
new
way
of
fumigating
clothes
up
yonder
was
infernal
unconstitutional
for
it
burnt
holes
in
them
and
there
was
no
remedy
against
the
county
the
same
remark
he
considered
to
apply
to
the
regulation
mode
of
cutting
the
hair
which
he
held
to
be
decidedly
unlawful
chitling
wound
up
his
observations
by
stating
that
he
had
not
touched
a
drop
of
anything
for
moral
long
days
and
that
he
he
might
be
busted
if
he
as
dry
as
a
do
you
think
the
gentleman
has
come
from
oliver
inquired
the
jew
with
a
grin
as
the
other
boys
put
a
bottle
of
spirits
on
the
table
i
do
know
sir
replied
oliver
that
inquired
tom
chitling
casting
a
contemptuous
look
at
oliver
young
friend
of
mine
my
dear
replied
the
jew
in
luck
then
said
the
young
man
with
a
meaning
look
at
fagin
mind
where
i
came
from
young
you
find
your
way
there
soon
enough
i
bet
a
crown
at
this
sally
the
boys
laughed
after
some
more
jokes
on
the
same
subject
they
exchanged
a
few
short
whispers
with
fagin
and
withdrew
after
some
words
apart
between
the
last
comer
and
fagin
they
drew
their
chairs
towards
the
fire
and
the
jew
telling
oliver
to
come
and
sit
by
him
led
the
conversation
to
the
topics
most
calculated
to
interest
his
hearers
these
were
the
great
advantages
of
the
trade
the
proficiency
of
the
dodger
the
amiability
of
charley
bates
and
the
liberality
of
the
jew
himself
at
length
these
subjects
displayed
signs
of
being
thoroughly
exhausted
and
chitling
did
the
same
for
the
house
of
correction
becomes
fatiguing
after
a
week
or
two
miss
betsy
accordingly
withdrew
and
left
the
party
to
their
repose
from
this
day
oliver
was
seldom
left
alone
but
was
placed
in
almost
constant
communication
with
the
two
boys
who
played
the
old
game
with
the
jew
every
day
whether
for
their
own
improvement
or
oliver
fagin
best
knew
at
other
times
the
old
man
would
tell
them
stories
of
robberies
he
had
committed
in
his
younger
days
mixed
up
with
so
much
that
was
droll
and
curious
that
oliver
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
and
showing
that
he
was
amused
in
spite
of
all
his
better
feelings
in
short
the
wily
old
jew
had
the
boy
in
his
toils
having
prepared
his
mind
by
solitude
and
gloom
to
prefer
any
society
to
the
companionship
of
his
own
sad
thoughts
in
such
a
dreary
place
he
was
now
slowly
instilling
into
his
soul
the
poison
which
he
hoped
would
blacken
it
and
change
its
hue
for
ever
chapter
xix
in
which
a
notable
plan
is
discussed
and
determined
on
it
was
a
chill
damp
windy
night
when
the
jew
buttoning
his
tight
round
his
shrivelled
body
and
pulling
the
collar
up
over
his
ears
so
as
completely
to
obscure
the
lower
part
of
his
face
emerged
from
his
den
he
paused
on
the
step
as
the
door
was
locked
and
chained
behind
him
and
having
listened
while
the
boys
made
all
secure
and
until
their
retreating
footsteps
were
no
longer
audible
slunk
down
the
street
as
quickly
as
he
could
the
house
to
which
oliver
had
been
conveyed
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
whitechapel
the
jew
stopped
for
an
instant
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
glancing
suspiciously
round
crossed
the
road
and
struck
off
in
the
direction
of
the
spitalfields
the
mud
lay
thick
upon
the
stones
and
a
black
mist
hung
over
the
streets
the
rain
fell
sluggishly
down
and
everything
felt
cold
and
clammy
to
the
touch
it
seemed
just
the
night
when
it
befitted
such
a
being
as
the
jew
to
be
abroad
as
he
glided
stealthily
along
creeping
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
walls
and
doorways
the
hideous
old
man
seemed
like
some
loathsome
reptile
engendered
in
the
slime
and
darkness
through
which
he
moved
crawling
forth
by
night
in
search
of
some
rich
offal
for
a
meal
he
kept
on
his
course
through
many
winding
and
narrow
ways
until
he
reached
bethnal
green
then
turning
suddenly
off
to
the
left
he
soon
became
involved
in
a
maze
of
the
mean
and
dirty
streets
which
abound
in
that
close
and
quarter
the
jew
was
evidently
too
familiar
with
the
ground
he
traversed
to
be
at
all
bewildered
either
by
the
darkness
of
the
night
or
the
intricacies
of
the
way
he
hurried
through
several
alleys
and
streets
and
at
length
turned
into
one
lighted
only
by
a
single
lamp
at
the
farther
end
at
the
door
of
a
house
in
this
street
he
knocked
having
exchanged
a
few
muttered
words
with
the
person
who
opened
it
he
walked
upstairs
a
dog
growled
as
he
touched
the
handle
of
a
and
a
voice
demanded
who
was
there
me
bill
only
me
my
dear
said
the
jew
looking
in
in
your
body
then
said
sikes
down
you
stupid
brute
do
you
know
the
devil
when
he
got
a
on
apparently
the
dog
had
been
somewhat
deceived
by
fagin
outer
garment
for
as
the
jew
unbuttoned
it
and
threw
it
over
the
back
of
a
chair
he
retired
to
the
corner
from
which
he
had
risen
wagging
his
tail
as
he
went
to
show
that
he
was
as
well
satisfied
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
be
said
sikes
my
dear
replied
the
nancy
the
latter
recognition
was
uttered
with
just
enough
of
embarrassment
to
imply
a
doubt
of
its
reception
for
fagin
and
his
young
friend
had
not
met
since
she
had
interfered
in
behalf
of
oliver
all
doubts
upon
the
subject
if
he
had
any
were
speedily
removed
by
the
young
behaviour
she
took
her
feet
off
the
fender
pushed
back
her
chair
and
bade
fagin
draw
up
his
without
saying
more
about
it
for
it
was
a
cold
night
and
no
mistake
is
cold
nancy
dear
said
the
jew
as
he
warmed
his
skinny
hands
over
the
fire
seems
to
go
right
through
one
added
the
old
man
touching
his
side
must
be
a
piercer
if
it
finds
its
way
through
your
heart
said
sikes
him
something
to
drink
nancy
burn
my
body
make
haste
it
enough
to
turn
a
man
ill
to
see
his
lean
old
carcase
shivering
in
that
way
like
a
ugly
ghost
just
rose
from
the
grave
nancy
quickly
brought
a
bottle
from
a
cupboard
in
which
there
were
many
which
to
judge
from
the
diversity
of
their
appearance
were
filled
with
several
kinds
of
liquids
sikes
pouring
out
a
glass
of
brandy
bade
the
jew
drink
it
off
enough
quite
thankye
bill
replied
the
jew
putting
down
the
glass
after
just
setting
his
lips
to
it
you
afraid
of
our
getting
the
better
of
you
are
you
inquired
sikes
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
jew
with
a
hoarse
grunt
of
contempt
sikes
seized
the
glass
and
threw
the
remainder
of
its
contents
into
the
ashes
as
a
preparatory
ceremony
to
filling
it
again
for
himself
which
he
did
at
once
the
jew
glanced
round
the
room
as
his
companion
tossed
down
the
second
glassful
not
in
curiousity
for
he
had
seen
it
often
before
but
in
a
restless
and
suspicious
manner
habitual
to
him
it
was
a
meanly
furnished
apartment
with
nothing
but
the
contents
of
the
closet
to
induce
the
belief
that
its
occupier
was
anything
but
a
working
man
and
with
no
more
suspicious
articles
displayed
to
view
than
two
or
three
heavy
bludgeons
which
stood
in
a
corner
and
a
that
hung
over
the
said
sikes
smacking
his
lips
i
ready
business
inquired
the
jew
business
replied
sikes
say
what
you
got
to
say
the
crib
at
chertsey
bill
said
the
jew
drawing
his
chair
forward
and
speaking
in
a
very
low
voice
wot
about
it
inquired
sikes
you
know
what
i
mean
my
dear
said
the
jew
knows
what
i
mean
nancy

sneered
sikes
he
wo
and
that
the
same
thing
speak
out
and
call
things
by
their
right
names
do
sit
there
winking
and
blinking
and
talking
to
me
in
hints
as
if
you
war
the
very
first
that
thought
about
the
robbery
wot
d
mean
bill
hush
said
the
jew
who
had
in
vain
attempted
to
stop
this
burst
of
indignation
will
hear
us
my
dear
somebody
will
hear
us
hear
said
sikes
do
care
but
as
sikes
did
care
on
reflection
he
dropped
his
voice
as
he
said
the
words
and
grew
calmer
there
said
the
jew
coaxingly
was
only
my
caution
nothing
more
now
my
dear
about
that
crib
at
chertsey
when
is
it
to
be
done
bill
eh
when
is
it
to
be
done
such
plate
my
dear
such
plate
said
the
jew
rubbing
his
hands
and
elevating
his
eyebrows
in
a
rapture
of
anticipation
at
all
replied
sikes
coldly
to
be
done
at
all
echoed
the
jew
leaning
back
in
his
chair
not
at
all
rejoined
sikes
least
it
ca
be
a
job
as
we
expected
it
has
been
properly
gone
about
said
the
jew
turning
pale
with
anger
tell
me
i
will
tell
you
retorted
sikes
are
you
that
not
to
be
told
i
tell
you
that
toby
crackit
has
been
hanging
about
the
place
for
a
fortnight
and
he
ca
get
one
of
the
servants
in
line
you
mean
to
tell
me
bill
said
the
jew
softening
as
the
other
grew
heated
neither
of
the
two
men
in
the
house
can
be
got
over
i
do
mean
to
tell
you
so
replied
sikes
old
lady
has
had
these
twenty
years
and
if
you
were
to
give
five
hundred
pound
they
would
be
in
it
do
you
mean
to
say
my
dear
remonstrated
the
jew
the
women
ca
be
got
over
a
bit
of
it
replied
sikes
by
flash
toby
crackit
said
the
jew
incredulously
what
women
are
bill
not
even
by
flash
toby
crackit
replied
sikes
says
worn
sham
whiskers
and
a
canary
waistcoat
the
whole
blessed
time
been
loitering
down
there
and
it
all
of
no
use
should
have
tried
mustachios
and
a
pair
of
military
trousers
my
dear
said
the
jew
he
did
rejoined
sikes
they
war
of
no
more
use
than
the
other
plant
the
jew
looked
blank
at
this
information
after
ruminating
for
some
minutes
with
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
he
raised
his
head
and
said
with
a
deep
sigh
that
if
flash
toby
crackit
reported
aright
he
feared
the
game
was
up
yet
said
the
old
man
dropping
his
hands
on
his
knees
a
sad
thing
my
dear
to
lose
so
much
when
we
had
set
our
hearts
upon
it
it
is
said
sikes
luck
a
long
silence
ensued
during
which
the
jew
was
plunged
in
deep
thought
with
his
face
wrinkled
into
an
expression
of
villainy
perfectly
demoniacal
sikes
eyed
him
furtively
from
time
to
time
nancy
apparently
fearful
of
irritating
the
housebreaker
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
as
if
she
had
been
deaf
to
all
that
passed
said
sikes
abruptly
breaking
the
stillness
that
prevailed
it
worth
fifty
shiners
extra
if
it
safely
done
from
the
outside
said
the
jew
as
suddenly
rousing
himself
it
a
bargain
inquired
sikes
my
dear
yes
rejoined
the
jew
his
eyes
glistening
and
every
muscle
in
his
face
working
with
the
excitement
that
the
inquiry
had
awakened
said
sikes
thrusting
aside
the
jew
hand
with
some
disdain
it
come
off
as
soon
as
you
like
toby
and
me
were
over
the
the
night
afore
last
sounding
the
panels
of
the
door
and
shutters
the
crib
barred
up
at
night
like
a
jail
but
there
one
part
we
can
crack
safe
and
softly
is
that
bill
asked
the
jew
eagerly
whispered
sikes
you
cross
the
lawn
said
the
jew
bending
his
head
forward
with
his
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
it
cried
sikes
stopping
short
as
the
girl
scarcely
moving
her
head
looked
suddenly
round
and
pointed
for
an
instant
to
the
face
mind
which
part
it
is
you
ca
do
it
without
me
i
know
but
it
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
when
one
deals
with
you

like
my
dear

replied
the
jew
there
no
help
wanted
but

sikes

a
boy

first

the
jew

panel

sikes

he
mus

a
big

said
sikes
reflectively
i
only

that
young
boy

ned
the
he
kept
him
small
on
purpose
and
let
him
out
by
the
job
but
the
father
gets
lagged
and
then
the
juvenile
delinquent
society
comes
and
takes
the
boy
away
from
a
trade
where
he
was
earning
money
teaches
him
to
read
and
write
and
in
time
makes
a
of
him
and
so
they
go
on
said
sikes
his
wrath
rising
with
the
recollection
of
his
wrongs
they
go
on
and
if
they
got
money
enough
which
it
a
providence
they
have
we
should
have
half
a
dozen
boys
left
in
the
whole
trade
in
a
year
or
two
more
we
should
acquiesced
the
jew
who
had
been
considering
during
this
speech
and
had
only
caught
the
last
sentence
now
inquired
sikes
the
jew
nodded
his
head
towards
nancy
who
was
still
gazing
at
the
fire
and
intimated
by
a
sign
that
he
would
have
her
told
to
leave
the
room
sikes
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
as
if
he
thought
the
precaution
unnecessary
but
complied
nevertheless
by
requesting
miss
nancy
to
fetch
him
a
jug
of
beer
do
want
any
beer
said
nancy
folding
her
arms
and
retaining
her
seat
very
composedly
tell
you
i
do
replied
sikes
rejoined
the
girl
coolly
on
fagin
i
know
what
going
to
say
bill
he
need
mind
me
the
jew
still
hesitated
sikes
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
some
surprise
you
do
mind
the
old
girl
do
you
fagin
he
asked
at
length
known
her
long
enough
to
trust
her
or
the
devil
in
it
she
ai
one
to
blab
are

nancy

replied
the
young
lady
drawing
her
chair
up
to
the
table
and
putting
her
elbows
upon
it
no
my
dear
i
know
you

said
the
jew
and
again
the
old
man
paused
wot
inquired
sikes
did
know
whether
she
might
be
out
of
sorts
you
know
my
dear
as
she
was
the
other
night
replied
the
jew
at
this
confession
miss
nancy
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
swallowing
a
glass
of
brandy
shook
her
head
with
an
air
of
defiance
and
burst
into
sundry
exclamations
of
the
game
say
die
and
the
like
these
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
both
gentlemen
for
the
jew
nodded
his
head
with
a
satisfied
air
and
resumed
his
seat
as
did
sikes
likewise
fagin
said
nancy
with
a
laugh
bill
at
once
about
oliver

clever
one

dear

sharpest
girl

the
jew

her
on
the
neck

about
oliver
i
was
going
to
speak
sure
enough
ha
ha
ha
about
him
demanded
sikes
the
boy
for
you
my
dear
replied
the
jew
in
a
hoarse
whisper
laying
his
finger
on
the
side
of
his
nose
and
grinning
frightfully
exclaimed
sikes
him
bill
said
nancy
would
if
i
was
in
your
place
he
may
be
so
much
up
as
any
of
the
others
but
that
not
what
you

open
a
door
for

upon
it

safe

in
good
training
these
last
few
weeks
and
it
time

began
to
work
for
his
bread

others

all
too
big
he

just

size

sikes
ruminating

do
everything

my
dear
interposed
the
jew
ca
help
himself
that
is
if
you
frighten
him
enough
him
echoed
sikes
be
no
sham
frightening
mind
you
if
there
anything
queer
about
him
when
we
once
get
into
the
work
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
you
wo
see
him
alive
again
fagin
think
of
that
before
you
send
him
mark
my
words
said
the
robber
poising
a
crowbar
which
he
had
drawn
from
under
the
bedstead
thought
of
it
all
said
the
jew
with
energy
i
had
my
eye
upon
him
my
dears
close
close
once
let
him
feel
that
he
is
one
of
us
once
fill
his
mind
with
the
idea
that
he
has
been
a
thief
and
he
ours
ours
for
his
life
oho
it
could
have
come
about
better
the
old
man
crossed
his
arms
upon
his
breast
and
drawing
his
head
and
shoulders
into
a
heap
literally
hugged
himself
for
joy
said
sikes
you
mean
i
do
my
dear
said
the
jew
with
a
shrill
chuckle
if
you
like
bill
wot
said
sikes
scowling
fiercely
on
his
agreeable
friend
makes
you
take
so
much
pains
about
one
kid
when
you
know
there
are
fifty
boys
snoozing
about
common
garden
every
night
as
you
might
pick
and
choose
from
they
of
no
use
to
me
my
dear
replied
the
jew
with
some
confusion
worth
the
taking
their
looks
convict
when
they
get
into
trouble
and
i
lose
all
with
this
boy
properly
managed
my
dears
i
could
do
what
i
could
with
twenty
of
them
besides
said
the
jew
recovering
his
has
us
now
if
he
could
only
give
us
again
and
he
must
be
in
the
same
boat
with
us
never
mind
how
he
came
there
it
quite
enough
for
my
power
over
him
that
he
was
in
a
robbery
that
all
i
want
now
how
much
better
this
is
than
being
obliged
to
put
the
poor
leetle
boy
out
of
the
way
which
would
be
dangerous
and
we
should
lose
by
it
besides
is
it
to
be
done
asked
nancy
stopping
some
turbulent
exclamation
on
the
part
of
sikes
expressive
of
the
disgust
with
which
he
received
fagin
affectation
of
humanity
to
be
sure
said
the
jew
is
it
to
be
done
bill
planned
with
toby
the
night
arter
rejoined
sikes
in
a
surly
voice
he
heerd
nothing
from
me
to
the
contrairy
said
the
jew
no
moon
rejoined
sikes
all
arranged
about
bringing
off
the
swag
is
it
asked
the
jew
sikes
nodded
about
ah
it
all
planned
rejoined
sikes
interrupting
him
mind
particulars
you
better
bring
the
boy
here
night
i
shall
get
off
the
stone
an
hour
arter
daybreak
then
you
hold
your
tongue
and
keep
the
ready
and
that
all
you
have
to
do
after
some
discussion
in
which
all
three
took
an
active
part
it
was
decided
that
nancy
should
repair
to
the
jew
next
evening
when
the
night
had
set
in
and
bring
oliver
away
with
her
fagin
craftily
observing
that
if
he
evinced
any
disinclination
to
the
task
he
would
be
more
willing
to
accompany
the
girl
who
had
so
recently
interfered
in
his
behalf
than
anybody
else
it
was
also
solemnly
arranged
that
poor
oliver
should
for
the
purposes
of
the
contemplated
expedition
be
unreservedly
consigned
to
the
care
and
custody
of
william
sikes
and
further
that
the
said
sikes
should
deal
with
him
as
he
thought
fit
and
should
not
be
held
responsible
by
the
jew
for
any
mischance
or
evil
that
might
be
necessary
to
visit
him
it
being
understood
that
to
render
the
compact
in
this
respect
binding
any
representations
made
by
sikes
on
his
return
should
be
required
to
be
confirmed
and
corroborated
in
all
important
particulars
by
the
testimony
of
flash
toby
crackit
these
preliminaries
adjusted
sikes
proceeded
to
drink
brandy
at
a
furious
rate
and
to
flourish
the
crowbar
in
an
alarming
manner
yelling
forth
at
the
same
time
most
unmusical
snatches
of
song
mingled
with
wild
execrations
at
length
in
a
fit
of
professional
enthusiasm
he
insisted
upon
producing
his
box
of
housebreaking
tools
which
he
had
no
sooner
stumbled
in
with
and
opened
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
the
nature
and
properties
of
the
various
implements
it
contained
and
the
peculiar
beauties
of
their
construction
than
he
fell
over
the
box
upon
the
floor
and
went
to
sleep
where
he
fell
nancy
said
the
jew
muffling
himself
up
as
before
their
eyes
met
and
the
jew
scrutinised
her
narrowly
there
was
no
flinching
about
the
girl
she
was
as
true
and
earnest
in
the
matter
as
toby
crackit
himself
could
be
the
jew
again
bade
her
and
bestowing
a
sly
kick
upon
the
prostrate
form
of
sikes
while
her
back
was
turned
groped
downstairs
the
way
muttered
the
jew
to
himself
as
he
turned
homeward
worst
of
these
women
is
that
a
very
little
thing
serves
to
call
up
some
feeling
and
the
best
of
them
is
that
it
never
lasts
ha
ha
the
man
against
the
child
for
a
bag
of
gold
beguiling
the
time
with
these
pleasant
reflections
fagin
wended
his
way
through
mud
and
mire
to
his
gloomy
abode
where
the
dodger
was
sitting
up
impatiently
awaiting
his
return
oliver
i
want
to
speak
to
him
was
his
first
remark
as
they
descended
the
stairs
ago
replied
the
dodger
throwing
open
a
door
he
is
the
boy
was
lying
fast
asleep
on
a
rude
bed
upon
the
floor
so
pale
with
anxiety
and
sadness
and
the
closeness
of
his
prison
that
he
looked
like
death
not
death
as
it
shows
in
shroud
and
coffin
but
in
the
guise
it
wears
when
life
has
just
departed
when
a
young
and
gentle
spirit
has
but
an
instant
fled
to
heaven
and
the
gross
air
of
the
world
has
not
had
time
to
breathe
upon
the
changing
dust
it
hallowed
now
said
the
jew
turning
softly
away
chapter
xx
wherein
oliver
is
delivered
over
to
william
sikes
when
oliver
awoke
in
the
morning
he
was
a
good
deal
surprised
to
find
that
a
new
pair
of
shoes
with
strong
thick
soles
had
been
placed
at
his
bedside
and
that
his
old
shoes
had
been
removed
at
first
he
was
pleased
with
the
discovery
hoping
that
it
might
be
the
forerunner
of
his
release
but
such
thoughts
were
quickly
dispelled
on
his
sitting
down
to
breakfast
along
with
the
jew
who
told
him
in
a
tone
and
manner
which
increased
his
alarm
that
he
was
to
be
taken
to
the
residence
of
bill
sikes
that
night
to
stop
there
sir
asked
oliver
anxiously
no
my
dear
not
to
stop
there
replied
the
jew
like
to
lose
you
do
be
afraid
oliver
you
shall
come
back
to
us
again
ha
ha
ha
we
wo
be
so
cruel
as
to
send
you
away
my
dear
oh
no
no
the
old
man
who
was
stooping
over
the
fire
toasting
a
piece
of
bread
looked
round
as
he
bantered
oliver
thus
and
chuckled
as
if
to
show
that
he
knew
he
would
still
be
very
glad
to
get
away
if
he
could
suppose
said
the
jew
fixing
his
eyes
on
oliver
want
to
know
what
you
going
to
bill
for
my
dear
oliver
coloured
involuntarily
to
find
that
the
old
thief
had
been
reading
his
thoughts
but
boldly
said
yes
he
did
want
to
know
do
you
think
inquired
fagin
parrying
the
question
i
do
know
sir
replied
oliver
said
the
jew
turning
away
with
a
disappointed
countenance
from
a
close
perusal
of
the
boy
face
till
bill
tells
you
then
the
jew
seemed
much
vexed
by
oliver
not
expressing
any
greater
curiosity
on
the
subject
but
the
truth
is
that
although
oliver
felt
very
anxious
he
was
too
much
confused
by
the
earnest
cunning
of
fagin
looks
and
his
own
speculations
to
make
any
further
inquiries
just
then
he
had
no
other
opportunity
for
the
jew
remained
very
surly
and
silent
till
night
when
he
prepared
to
go
abroad
may
burn
a
candle
said
the
jew
putting
one
upon
the
table
here
a
book
for
you
to
read
till
they
come
to
fetch
you
replied
oliver
softly
the
jew
walked
to
the
door
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
boy
as
he
went
suddenly
stopping
he
called
him
by
his
name
oliver
looked
up
the
jew
pointing
to
the
candle
motioned
him
to
light
it
he
did
so
and
as
he
placed
the
candlestick
upon
the
table
saw
that
the
jew
was
gazing
fixedly
at
him
with
lowering
and
contracted
brows
from
the
dark
end
of
the
room
heed
oliver
take
heed
said
the
old
man
shaking
his
right
hand
before
him
in
a
warning
manner
a
rough
man
and
thinks
nothing
of
blood
when
his
own
is
up
whatever
falls
out
say
nothing
and
do
what
he
bids
you
mind
placing
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
he
suffered
his
features
gradually
to
resolve
themselves
into
a
ghastly
grin
and
nodding
his
head
left
the
room
oliver
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
when
the
old
man
disappeared
and
pondered
with
a
trembling
heart
on
the
words
he
had
just
heard
the
more
he
thought
of
the
jew
admonition
the
more
he
was
at
a
loss
to
divine
its
real
purpose
and
meaning
he
could
think
of
no
bad
object
to
be
attained
by
sending
him
to
sikes
which
would
not
be
equally
well
answered
by
his
remaining
with
fagin
and
after
meditating
for
a
long
time
concluded
that
he
had
been
selected
to
perform
some
ordinary
menial
offices
for
the
housebreaker
until
another
boy
better
suited
for
his
purpose
could
be
engaged
he
was
too
well
accustomed
to
suffering
and
had
suffered
too
much
where
he
was
to
bewail
the
prospect
of
change
very
severely
he
remained
lost
in
thought
for
some
minutes
and
then
with
a
heavy
sigh
snuffed
the
candle
and
taking
up
the
book
which
the
jew
had
left
with
him
began
to
read
he
turned
over
the
leaves
carelessly
at
first
but
lighting
on
a
passage
which
attracted
his
attention
he
soon
became
intent
upon
the
volume
it
was
a
history
of
the
lives
and
trials
of
great
criminals
and
the
pages
were
soiled
and
thumbed
with
use
here
he
read
of
dreadful
crimes
that
made
the
blood
run
cold
of
secret
murders
that
had
been
committed
by
the
lonely
wayside
of
bodies
hidden
from
the
eye
of
man
in
deep
pits
and
wells
which
would
not
keep
them
down
deep
as
they
were
but
had
yielded
them
up
at
last
after
many
years
and
so
maddened
the
murderers
with
the
sight
that
in
their
horror
they
had
confessed
their
guilt
and
yelled
for
the
gibbet
to
end
their
agony
here
too
he
read
of
men
who
lying
in
their
beds
at
dead
of
night
had
been
tempted
so
they
said
and
led
on
by
their
own
bad
thoughts
to
such
dreadful
bloodshed
as
it
made
the
flesh
creep
and
the
limbs
quail
to
think
of
the
terrible
descriptions
were
so
real
and
vivid
that
the
sallow
pages
seemed
to
turn
red
with
gore
and
the
words
upon
them
to
be
sounded
in
his
ears
as
if
they
were
whispered
in
hollow
murmurs
by
the
spirits
of
the
dead
in
a
paroxysm
of
fear
the
boy
closed
the
book
and
thrust
it
from
him
then
falling
upon
his
knees
he
prayed
heaven
to
spare
him
from
such
deeds
and
rather
to
will
that
he
should
die
at
once
than
be
reserved
for
crimes
so
fearful
and
appalling
by
degrees
he
grew
more
calm
and
besought
in
a
low
and
broken
voice
that
he
might
be
rescued
from
his
present
dangers
and
that
if
any
aid
were
to
be
raised
up
for
a
poor
outcast
boy
who
had
never
known
the
love
of
friends
or
kindred
it
might
come
to
him
now
when
desolate
and
deserted
he
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
wickedness
and
guilt
he
had
concluded
his
prayer
but
still
remained
with
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
when
a
rustling
noise
aroused
him
that
he
cried
starting
up
and
catching
sight
of
a
figure
standing
by
the
door
there
only
me
replied
a
tremulous
voice
oliver
raised
the
candle
above
his
head
and
looked
towards
the
door
it
was
nancy
down
the
light
said
the
girl
turning
away
her
head
hurts
my
eyes
oliver
saw
that
she
was
very
pale
and
gently
inquired
if
she
were
ill
the
girl
threw
herself
into
a
chair
with
her
back
towards
him
and
wrung
her
hands
but
made
no
reply
forgive
me
she
cried
after
a
while
never
thought
of
this
anything
happened
asked
oliver
i
help
you
i
will
if
i
can
i
will
indeed
she
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
caught
her
throat
and
uttering
a
gurgling
sound
gasped
for
breath
cried
oliver
is
it
the
girl
beat
her
hands
upon
her
knees
and
her
feet
upon
the
ground
and
suddenly
stopping
drew
her
shawl
close
round
her
and
shivered
with
cold
oliver
stirred
the
fire
drawing
her
chair
close
to
it
she
sat
there
for
a
little
time
without
speaking
but
at
length
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
round
do
know
what
comes
over
me
sometimes
said
she
affecting
to
busy
herself
in
arranging
her
dress
this
damp
dirty
room
i
think
now
nolly
dear
are
you
ready
i
to
go
with
you
asked
oliver
i
have
come
from
bill
replied
the
girl
are
to
go
with
me
for
asked
oliver
recoiling
for
echoed
the
girl
raising
her
eyes
and
averting
them
again
the
moment
they
encountered
the
boy
face
for
no
harm
do
believe
it
said
oliver
who
had
watched
her
closely
it
your
own
way
rejoined
the
girl
affecting
to
laugh
no
good
then
oliver
could
see
that
he
had
some
power
over
the
girl
better
feelings
and
for
an
instant
thought
of
appealing
to
her
compassion
for
his
helpless
state
but
then
the
thought
darted
across
his
mind
that
it
was
barely
eleven
and
that
many
people
were
still
in
the
streets
of
whom
surely
some
might
be
found
to
give
credence
to
his
tale
as
the
reflection
occured
to
him
he
stepped
forward
and
said
somewhat
hastily
that
he
was
ready
neither
his
brief
consideration
nor
its
purport
was
lost
on
his
companion
she
eyed
him
narrowly
while
he
spoke
and
cast
upon
him
a
look
of
intelligence
which
sufficiently
showed
that
she
guessed
what
had
been
passing
in
his
thoughts
said
the
girl
stooping
over
him
and
pointing
to
the
door
as
she
looked
cautiously
round
ca
help
yourself
i
have
tried
hard
for
you
but
all
to
no
purpose
you
are
hedged
round
and
round
if
ever
you
are
to
get
loose
from
here
this
is
not
the
time
struck
by
the
energy
of
her
manner
oliver
looked
up
in
her
face
with
great
surprise
she
seemed
to
speak
the
truth
her
countenance
was
white
and
agitated
and
she
trembled
with
very
earnestness
have
saved
you
from
being
once
and
i
will
again
and
i
do
now
continued
the
girl
aloud
those
who
would
have
fetched
you
if
i
had
not
would
have
been
far
more
rough
than
me
i
have
promised
for
your
being
quiet
and
silent
if
you
are
not
you
will
only
do
harm
to
yourself
and
me
too
and
perhaps
be
my
death
see
here
i
have
borne
all
this
for
you
already
as
true
as
god
sees
me
show
it
she
pointed
hastily
to
some
livid
bruises
on
her
neck
and
arms
and
continued
with
great
rapidity
this
and
do
let
me
suffer
more
for
you
just
now
if
i
could
help
you
i
would
but
i
have
not
the
power
they
do
mean
to
harm
you
whatever
they
make
you
do
is
no
fault
of
yours
hush
every
word
from
you
is
a
blow
for
me
give
me
your
hand
make
haste
your
hand
she
caught
the
hand
which
oliver
instinctively
placed
in
hers
and
blowing
out
the
light
drew
him
after
her
up
the
stairs
the
door
was
opened
quickly
by
some
one
shrouded
in
the
darkness
and
was
as
quickly
closed
when
they
had
passed
out
a
was
in
waiting
with
the
same
vehemence
which
she
had
exhibited
in
addressing
oliver
the
girl
pulled
him
in
with
her
and
drew
the
curtains
close
the
driver
wanted
no
directions
but
lashed
his
horse
into
full
speed
without
the
delay
of
an
instant
the
girl
still
held
oliver
fast
by
the
hand
and
continued
to
pour
into
his
ear
the
warnings
and
assurances
she
had
already
imparted
all
was
so
quick
and
hurried
that
he
had
scarcely
time
to
recollect
where
he
was
or
how
he
came
there
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
house
to
which
the
jew
steps
had
been
directed
on
the
previous
evening
for
one
brief
moment
oliver
cast
a
hurried
glance
along
the
empty
street
and
a
cry
for
help
hung
upon
his
lips
but
the
girl
voice
was
in
his
ear
beseeching
him
in
such
tones
of
agony
to
remember
her
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
utter
it
while
he
hesitated
the
opportunity
was
gone
he
was
already
in
the
house
and
the
door
was
shut
way
said
the
girl
releasing
her
hold
for
the
first
time
replied
sikes
appearing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
with
a
candle
that
the
time
of
day
come
on
this
was
a
very
strong
expression
of
approbation
an
uncommonly
hearty
welcome
from
a
person
of
sikes
temperament
nancy
appearing
much
gratified
thereby
saluted
him
cordially
gone
home
with
tom
observed
sikes
as
he
lighted
them
up
have
been
in
the
way
right
rejoined
nancy
you
got
the
kid
said
sikes
when
they
had
all
reached
the
room
closing
the
door
as
he
spoke
here
he
is
replied
nancy
he
come
quiet
inquired
sikes
a
lamb
rejoined
nancy
glad
to
hear
it
said
sikes
looking
grimly
at
oliver
the
sake
of
his
young
carcase
as
would
otherways
have
suffered
for
it
come
here
young
and
let
me
read
you
a
lectur
which
is
as
well
got
over
at
once
thus
addressing
his
new
pupil
sikes
pulled
off
oliver
cap
and
threw
it
into
a
corner
and
then
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
sat
himself
down
by
the
table
and
stood
the
boy
in
front
of
him
first
do
you
know
wot
this
is
inquired
sikes
taking
up
a
which
lay
on
the
table
oliver
replied
in
the
affirmative
then
look
here
continued
sikes
is
powder
that
a
bullet
and
this
is
a
little
bit
of
a
old
hat
for
waddin
oliver
murmured
his
comprehension
of
the
different
bodies
referred
to
and
sikes
proceeded
to
load
the
pistol
with
great
nicety
and
deliberation
it
loaded
said
sikes
when
he
had
finished
i
see
it
is
sir
replied
oliver
said
the
robber
grasping
oliver
wrist
and
putting
the
barrel
so
close
to
his
temple
that
they
touched
at
which
moment
the
boy
could
not
repress
a
start
you
speak
a
word
when
you
out
with
me
except
when
i
speak
to
you
that
loading
will
be
in
your
head
without
notice
so
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
speak
without
leave
say
your
prayers
first
having
bestowed
a
scowl
upon
the
object
of
this
warning
to
increase
its
effect
sikes
continued
near
as
i
know
there
is
anybody
as
would
be
asking
very
partickler
arter
you
if
you
disposed
of
so
i
need
take
this
of
trouble
to
explain
matters
to
you
if
it
war
for
your
own
good
d
hear
me
short
and
the
long
of
what
you
mean
said
nancy
speaking
very
emphatically
and
slightly
frowning
at
oliver
as
if
to
bespeak
his
serious
attention
to
her
words
that
if
you
crossed
by
him
in
this
job
you
have
on
hand
you
prevent
his
ever
telling
tales
afterwards
by
shooting
him
through
the
head
and
will
take
your
chance
of
swinging
for
it
as
you
do
for
a
great
many
other
things
in
the
way
of
business
every
month
of
your
life
it
observed
sikes
approvingly
can
always
put
things
in
fewest
except
when
it
blowing
up
and
then
they
lengthens
it
out
and
now
that
he
thoroughly
up
to
it
let
have
some
supper
and
get
a
snooze
before
starting
in
pursuance
of
this
request
nancy
quickly
laid
the
cloth
disappearing
for
a
few
minutes
she
presently
returned
with
a
pot
of
porter
and
a
dish
of
sheep
heads
which
gave
occasion
to
several
pleasant
witticisms
on
the
part
of
sikes
founded
upon
the
singular
coincidence
of
being
a
can
name
common
to
them
and
also
to
an
ingenious
implement
much
used
in
his
profession
indeed
the
worthy
gentleman
stimulated
perhaps
by
the
immediate
prospect
of
being
on
active
service
was
in
great
spirits
and
good
humour
in
proof
whereof
it
may
be
here
remarked
that
he
humourously
drank
all
the
beer
at
a
draught
and
did
not
utter
on
a
rough
calculation
more
than
oaths
during
the
whole
progress
of
the
meal
supper
being
ended
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
oliver
had
no
great
appetite
for
it
sikes
disposed
of
a
couple
of
glasses
of
spirits
and
water
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
ordering
nancy
with
many
imprecations
in
case
of
failure
to
call
him
at
five
precisely
oliver
stretched
himself
in
his
clothes
by
command
of
the
same
authority
on
a
mattress
upon
the
floor
and
the
girl
mending
the
fire
sat
before
it
in
readiness
to
rouse
them
at
the
appointed
time
for
a
long
time
oliver
lay
awake
thinking
it
not
impossible
that
nancy
might
seek
that
opportunity
of
whispering
some
further
advice
but
the
girl
sat
brooding
over
the
fire
without
moving
save
now
and
then
to
trim
the
light
weary
with
watching
and
anxiety
he
at
length
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
the
table
was
covered
with
and
sikes
was
thrusting
various
articles
into
the
pockets
of
his
which
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
nancy
was
busily
engaged
in
preparing
breakfast
it
was
not
yet
daylight
for
the
candle
was
still
burning
and
it
was
quite
dark
outside
a
sharp
rain
too
was
beating
against
the
and
the
sky
looked
black
and
cloudy
then
growled
sikes
as
oliver
started
up
five
look
sharp
or
you
get
no
breakfast
for
it
late
as
it
is
oliver
was
not
long
in
making
his
toilet
having
taken
some
breakfast
he
replied
to
a
surly
inquiry
from
sikes
by
saying
that
he
was
quite
ready
nancy
scarcely
looking
at
the
boy
threw
him
a
handkerchief
to
tie
round
his
throat
sikes
gave
him
a
large
rough
cape
to
button
over
his
shoulders
thus
attired
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
robber
who
merely
pausing
to
show
him
with
a
menacing
gesture
that
he
had
that
same
pistol
in
a
of
his
clasped
it
firmly
in
his
and
exchanging
a
farewell
with
nancy
led
him
away
oliver
turned
for
an
instant
when
they
reached
the
door
in
the
hope
of
meeting
a
look
from
the
girl
but
she
had
resumed
her
old
seat
in
front
of
the
fire
and
sat
perfectly
motionless
before
it
chapter
xxi
the
expedition
it
was
a
cheerless
morning
when
they
got
into
the
street
blowing
and
raining
hard
and
the
clouds
looking
dull
and
stormy
the
night
had
been
very
wet
large
pools
of
water
had
collected
in
the
road
and
the
kennels
were
overflowing
there
was
a
faint
glimmering
of
the
coming
day
in
the
sky
but
it
rather
aggravated
than
relieved
the
gloom
of
the
scene
the
sombre
light
only
serving
to
pale
that
which
the
street
lamps
afforded
without
shedding
any
warmer
or
brighter
tints
upon
the
wet
and
dreary
streets
there
appeared
to
be
nobody
stirring
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
the
windows
of
the
houses
were
all
closely
shut
and
the
streets
through
which
they
passed
were
noiseless
and
empty
by
the
time
they
had
turned
into
the
bethnal
green
road
the
day
had
fairly
begun
to
break
many
of
the
lamps
were
already
extinguished
a
few
country
waggons
were
slowly
toiling
on
towards
london
now
and
then
a
covered
with
mud
rattled
briskly
by
the
driver
bestowing
as
he
passed
an
admonitory
lash
upon
the
heavy
waggoner
who
by
keeping
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
had
endangered
his
arriving
at
the
office
a
quarter
of
a
minute
after
his
time
the
with
burning
inside
were
already
open
by
degrees
other
shops
began
to
be
unclosed
and
a
few
scattered
people
were
met
with
then
came
straggling
groups
of
labourers
going
to
their
work
then
men
and
women
with
on
their
heads
laden
with
vegetables
filled
with
or
whole
carcasses
of
meat
with
pails
an
unbroken
concourse
of
people
trudging
out
with
various
supplies
to
the
eastern
suburbs
of
the
town
as
they
approached
the
city
the
noise
and
traffic
gradually
increased
when
they
threaded
the
streets
between
shoreditch
and
smithfield
it
had
swelled
into
a
roar
of
sound
and
bustle
it
was
as
light
as
it
was
likely
to
be
till
night
came
on
again
and
the
busy
morning
of
half
the
london
population
had
begun
turning
down
sun
street
and
crown
street
and
crossing
finsbury
square
sikes
struck
by
way
of
chiswell
street
into
barbican
thence
into
long
lane
and
so
into
smithfield
from
which
latter
place
arose
a
tumult
of
discordant
sounds
that
filled
oliver
twist
with
amazement
it
was
the
ground
was
covered
nearly
with
filth
and
mire
a
thick
steam
perpetually
rising
from
the
reeking
bodies
of
the
cattle
and
mingling
with
the
fog
which
seemed
to
rest
upon
the
hung
heavily
above
all
the
pens
in
the
centre
of
the
large
area
and
as
many
temporary
pens
as
could
be
crowded
into
the
vacant
space
were
filled
with
sheep
tied
up
to
posts
by
the
gutter
side
were
long
lines
of
beasts
and
oxen
three
or
four
deep
countrymen
butchers
drovers
hawkers
boys
thieves
idlers
and
vagabonds
of
every
low
grade
were
mingled
together
in
a
mass
the
whistling
of
drovers
the
barking
dogs
the
bellowing
and
plunging
of
the
oxen
the
bleating
of
sheep
the
grunting
and
squeaking
of
pigs
the
cries
of
hawkers
the
shouts
oaths
and
quarrelling
on
all
sides
the
ringing
of
bells
and
roar
of
voices
that
issued
from
every
the
crowding
pushing
driving
beating
whooping
and
yelling
the
hideous
and
discordant
dim
that
resounded
from
every
corner
of
the
market
and
the
unwashed
unshaven
squalid
and
dirty
figures
constantly
running
to
and
fro
and
bursting
in
and
out
of
the
throng
rendered
it
a
stunning
and
bewildering
scene
which
quite
confounded
the
senses
sikes
dragging
oliver
after
him
elbowed
his
way
through
the
thickest
of
the
crowd
and
bestowed
very
little
attention
on
the
numerous
sights
and
sounds
which
so
astonished
the
boy
he
nodded
twice
or
thrice
to
a
passing
friend
and
resisting
as
many
invitations
to
take
a
morning
dram
pressed
steadily
onward
until
they
were
clear
of
the
turmoil
and
had
made
their
way
through
hosier
lane
into
holborn
young
said
sikes
looking
up
at
the
clock
of
church
upon
seven
you
must
step
out
come
do
lag
behind
already
sikes
accompanied
this
speech
with
a
jerk
at
his
little
wrist
oliver
quickening
his
pace
into
a
kind
of
trot
between
a
fast
walk
and
a
run
kept
up
with
the
rapid
strides
of
the
as
well
as
he
could
they
held
their
course
at
this
rate
until
they
had
passed
hyde
park
corner
and
were
on
their
way
to
kensington
when
sikes
relaxed
his
pace
until
an
empty
cart
which
was
at
some
little
distance
behind
came
up
seeing
written
on
it
he
asked
the
driver
with
as
much
civility
as
he
could
assume
if
he
would
give
them
a
lift
as
far
as
isleworth
up
said
the
man
that
your
boy
he
my
boy
replied
sikes
looking
hard
at
oliver
and
putting
his
hand
abstractedly
into
the
pocket
where
the
pistol
was
father
walks
rather
too
quick
for
you
do
he
my
man
inquired
the
driver
seeing
that
oliver
was
out
of
breath
a
bit
of
it
replied
sikes
interposing
used
to
it
here
take
hold
of
my
hand
ned
in
with
you
thus
addressing
oliver
he
helped
him
into
the
cart
and
the
driver
pointing
to
a
heap
of
sacks
told
him
to
lie
down
there
and
rest
himself
as
they
passed
the
different
oliver
wondered
more
and
more
where
his
companion
meant
to
take
him
kensington
hammersmith
chiswick
kew
bridge
brentford
were
all
passed
and
yet
they
went
on
as
steadily
as
if
they
had
only
just
begun
their
journey
at
length
they
came
to
a
called
the
coach
and
horses
a
little
way
beyond
which
another
road
appeared
to
run
off
and
here
the
cart
stopped
sikes
dismounted
with
great
precipitation
holding
oliver
by
the
hand
all
the
while
and
lifting
him
down
directly
bestowed
a
furious
look
upon
him
and
rapped
the
with
his
fist
in
a
significant
manner
boy
said
the
man
sulky
replied
sikes
giving
him
a
shake
sulky
a
young
dog
do
mind
him
i
rejoined
the
other
getting
into
his
cart
a
fine
day
after
all
and
he
drove
away
sikes
waited
until
he
had
fairly
gone
and
then
telling
oliver
he
might
look
about
him
if
he
wanted
once
again
led
him
onward
on
his
journey
they
turned
round
to
the
left
a
short
way
past
the
and
then
taking
a
road
walked
on
for
a
long
time
passing
many
large
gardens
and
gentlemen
houses
on
both
sides
of
the
way
and
stopping
for
nothing
but
a
little
beer
until
they
reached
a
town
here
against
the
wall
of
a
house
oliver
saw
written
up
in
pretty
large
letters
they
lingered
about
in
the
fields
for
some
hours
at
length
they
came
back
into
the
town
and
turning
into
an
old
with
a
defaced
ordered
some
dinner
by
the
kitchen
fire
the
kitchen
was
an
old
room
with
a
great
beam
across
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
and
benches
with
high
backs
to
them
by
the
fire
on
which
were
seated
several
rough
men
in
drinking
and
smoking
they
took
no
notice
of
oliver
and
very
little
of
sikes
and
as
sikes
took
very
little
notice
of
them
he
and
his
young
comrade
sat
in
a
corner
by
themselves
without
being
much
troubled
by
their
company
they
had
some
cold
meat
for
dinner
and
sat
so
long
after
it
while
sikes
indulged
himself
with
three
or
four
pipes
that
oliver
began
to
feel
quite
certain
they
were
not
going
any
further
being
much
tired
with
the
walk
and
getting
up
so
early
he
dozed
a
little
at
first
then
quite
overpowered
by
fatigue
and
the
fumes
of
the
tobacco
fell
asleep
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
push
from
sikes
rousing
himself
sufficiently
to
sit
up
and
look
about
him
he
found
that
worthy
in
close
fellowship
and
communication
with
a
labouring
man
over
a
pint
of
ale
you
going
on
to
lower
halliford

inquired
sikes

replied
the
man
who
seemed
a
little
the
worse
or
better
as
the
case
might
be
for
drinking
not
slow
about
it
neither
my
horse
has
got
a
load

his
new
friend

the
man
looking
out
of
the
pot

sikes
your

as
far
as

the
other
all

becky
the
other
gentleman

the
girl

said
the
man
with
tipsy
gravity
wo
do
you
know
not
rejoined
sikes
to
accommodate
us
and
wot
to
prevent
my
standing
treat
for
a
pint
or
so
in
return
the
stranger
reflected
upon
this
argument
with
a
very
profound
face
having
done
so
he
seized
sikes
by
the
hand
and
declared
he
was
a
real
good
fellow
to
which
sikes
replied
he
was
joking
as
if
he
had
been
sober
there
would
have
been
strong
reason
to
suppose
he
was
after
the
exchange
of
a
few
more
compliments
they
bade
the
company
and
went
out
the
girl
gathering
up
the
pots
and
glasses
as
they
did
so
and
lounging
out
to
the
door
with
her
hands
full
to
see
the
party
start
the
horse
whose
health
had
been
drunk
in
his
absence
was
standing
outside
ready
harnessed
to
the
cart
oliver
and
sikes
got
in
without
any
further
ceremony
and
the
man
to
whom
he
belonged
having
lingered
for
a
minute
or
two
bear
him
up
and
to
defy
the
hostler
and
the
world
to
produce
his
equal
mounted
also
then
the
hostler
was
told
to
give
the
horse
his
head
and
his
head
being
given
him
he
made
a
very
unpleasant
use
of
it
tossing
it
into
the
air
with
great
disdain
and
running
into
the
parlour
windows
over
the
way
after
performing
those
feats
and
supporting
himself
for
a
short
time
on
his
he
started
off
at
great
speed
and
rattled
out
of
the
town
right
gallantly
the
night
was
very
dark
a
damp
mist
rose
from
the
river
and
the
marshy
ground
about
and
spread
itself
over
the
dreary
fields
it
was
piercing
cold
too
all
was
gloomy
and
black
not
a
word
was
spoken
for
the
driver
had
grown
sleepy
and
sikes
was
in
no
mood
to
lead
him
into
conversation
oliver
sat
huddled
together
in
a
corner
of
the
cart
bewildered
with
alarm
and
apprehension
and
figuring
strange
objects
in
the
gaunt
trees
whose
branches
waved
grimly
to
and
fro
as
if
in
some
fantastic
joy
at
the
desolation
of
the
scene
as
they
passed
sunbury
church
the
clock
struck
seven
there
was
a
light
in
the
window
opposite
which
streamed
across
the
road
and
threw
into
more
sombre
shadow
a
dark
with
graves
beneath
it
there
was
a
dull
sound
of
falling
water
not
far
off
and
the
leaves
of
the
old
tree
stirred
gently
in
the
night
wind
it
seemed
like
quiet
music
for
the
repose
of
the
dead
sunbury
was
passed
through
and
they
came
again
into
the
lonely
road
two
or
three
miles
more
and
the
cart
stopped
sikes
alighted
took
oliver
by
the
hand
and
they
once
again
walked
on
they
turned
into
no
house
at
shepperton
as
the
weary
boy
had
expected
but
still
kept
walking
on
in
mud
and
darkness
through
gloomy
lanes
and
over
cold
open
wastes
until
they
came
within
sight
of
the
lights
of
a
town
at
no
great
distance
on
looking
intently
forward
oliver
saw
that
the
water
was
just
below
them
and
that
they
were
coming
to
the
foot
of
a
bridge
sikes
kept
straight
on
until
they
were
close
upon
the
bridge
then
turned
suddenly
down
a
bank
upon
the
left
water
thought
oliver
turning
sick
with
fear
has
brought
me
to
this
lonely
place
to
murder
me
he
was
about
to
throw
himself
on
the
ground
and
make
one
struggle
for
his
young
life
when
he
saw
that
they
stood
before
a
solitary
house
all
ruinous
and
decayed
there
was
a
window
on
each
side
of
the
dilapidated
entrance
and
one
story
above
but
no
light
was
visible
the
house
was
dark
dismantled
and
the
all
appearance
uninhabited
sikes
with
oliver
hand
still
in
his
softly
approached
the
low
porch
and
raised
the
latch
the
door
yielded
to
the
pressure
and
they
passed
in
together
chapter

a
loud
hoarse
voice
as
soon
as
they
set

the
passage

the

the
speaker
appeared
to
throw
a
or
some
such
article
at
the
person
he
addressed
to
rouse
him
from
his
slumbers
for
the
noise
of
a
wooden
body
falling
violently
was
heard
and
then
an
indistinct
muttering
as
of
a
man
between
sleep
and
awake
you
hear
cried
the
same
voice
bill
sikes
in
the
passage
with
nobody
to
do
the
civil
to
him
and
you
sleeping
there
as
if
you
took

with
your
meals
and
nothing
stronger
are
you
any
fresher
now
or
do
you
want
the
iron

to
wake
you
thoroughly
a
pair
of
slipshod
feet
shuffled
hastily
across
the
bare
floor
of
the
room
as
this
interrogatory
was
put
and
there
issued
from
a
door
on
the
right
hand
first
a
feeble
candle
and
next
the
form
of
the
same
individual
who
has
been
heretofore
described
as
labouring
under
the
infirmity
of
speaking
through
his
nose
and
officiating
as
waiter
at
the
on
saffron
hill
sikes
exclaimed
barney
with
real
or
counterfeit
joy
id
sir
cub
id
you
get
on
first
said
sikes
putting
oliver
in
front
of
him
or
i
shall
tread
upon
your
heels
muttering
a
curse
upon
his
tardiness
sikes
pushed
oliver
before
him
and
they
entered
a
low
dark
room
with
a
smoky
fire
two
or
three
broken
chairs
a
table
and
a
very
old
couch
on
which
with
his
legs
much
higher
than
his
head
a
man
was
reposing
at
full
length
smoking
a
long
clay
pipe
he
was
dressed
in
a
coat
with
large
brass
buttons
an
orange
neckerchief
a
coarse
staring
waistcoat
and
drab
breeches
crackit
for
he
it
was
had
no
very
great
quantity
of
hair
either
upon
his
head
or
face
but
what
he
had
was
of
a
reddish
dye
and
tortured
into
long
corkscrew
curls
through
which
he
occasionally
thrust
some
very
dirty
fingers
ornamented
with
large
common
rings
he
was
a
trifle
above
the
middle
size
and
apparently
rather
weak
in
the
legs
but
this
circumstance
by
no
means
detracted
from
his
own
admiration
of
his
which
he
contemplated
in
their
elevated
situation
with
lively
satisfaction
my
boy
said
this
figure
turning
his
head
towards
the
door
glad
to
see
you
i
was
almost
afraid
you
given
it
up
in
which
case
i
should
have
made
a
personal
wentur
hallo
uttering
this
exclamation
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
as
his
eyes
rested
on
oliver
toby
crackit
brought
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
and
demanded
who
that
was
boy
only
the
boy
replied
sikes
drawing
a
chair
towards
the
fire
of
bister
fagid
lads
exclaimed
barney
with
a
grin

exclaimed
toby
looking
at
oliver
an
inwalable
boy
that

for
the
old
ladies
pockets
in
chapels
his
mug
is
a
fortin
to
him
there
enough
of
that
interposed
sikes
impatiently
and
stooping
over
his
recumbant
friend
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
at
which
crackit
laughed
immensely
and
honoured
oliver
with
a
long
stare
of
astonishment
said
sikes
as
he
resumed
his
seat
you
give
us
something
to
eat
and
drink
while
we
waiting

some
heart
in

by
the
fire
younker
and
rest
yourself
for
you
have
to
go
out
with
us
again
though
not
very
far
off
oliver
looked
at
sikes
in
mute
and
timid
wonder
and
drawing
a
stool
to
the
fire
sat
with
his
aching
head
upon
his
hands
scarecely
knowing
where
he
was
or
what
was
passing
around
him
said
toby
as
the
young
jew
placed
some
fragments
of
food
and
a
bottle
upon
the
table
to
the
crack
he
rose
to
honour
the
toast
and
carefully
depositing
his
empty
pipe
in
a
corner
advanced
to
the
table
filled
a
glass
with
spirits
and
drank
off
its
contents
sikes
did
the
same
drain
for
the
boy
said
toby
a
with
it
innocence
said
oliver
looking
piteously
up
into
the

it
echoed
toby

whole
family
of
dodgers

you
perwerse
imp
drink
it
frightened
by
the
menacing
gestures
of
the
two
men
oliver
hastily
swallowed
the
contents
of
the
glass
and
immediately
fell
into
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
which
delighted
toby
crackit
and
barney
and
even
drew
a
smile
from
the
surly
sikes
this
done
and
sikes
having
satisfied
his
appetite
oliver
could
eat
nothing
but
a
small
crust
of
bread
which
they
made
him
swallow
the
two
men
laid
themselves
down
on
chairs
for
a
short
nap
oliver
retained
his
stool
by
the
fire
barney
wrapped
in
a
blanket
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
close
outside
the
fender
they
slept
or
appeared
to
sleep
for
some
time
nobody
stirring
but
barney
who
rose
once
or
twice
to
throw
coals
on
the
fire
oliver
fell
into
a
heavy
doze
imagining
himself
straying
along
the
gloomy
lanes
or
wandering
about
the
dark
churchyard
or
retracing
some
one
or
other
of
the
scenes
of
the
past
day
when
he
was
roused
by
toby
crackit
jumping
up
and
declaring
it
was
one
in
an
instant
the
other
two
were
on
their
legs
and
all
were
actively
engaged
in
busy
preparation
sikes
and
his
companion
enveloped
their
necks
and
chins
in
large
dark
shawls
and
drew
on
their
barney
opening
a
cupboard
brought
forth
several
articles
which
he
hastily
crammed
into
the
pockets
for
me
barney
said
toby
crackit

barney
producing
a
pair
of
pistols
loaded

stowing
them
away

sikes

nothing

inquired
toby
fastening
a
small
crowbar
to
a
loop
inside
the
skirt
of
his
coat
right
rejoined
his
companion
them
bits
of
timber
barney
that
the
time
of
day
with
these
words
he
took
a
thick
stick
from
barney
hands
who
having
delivered
another
to
toby
busied
himself
in
fastening
on
oliver
cape
then
said
sikes
holding
out
his
hand
oliver
who
was
completely
stupified
by
the
unwonted
exercise
and
the
air
and
the
drink
which
had
been
forced
upon
him
put
his
hand
mechanically
into
that
which
sikes
extended
for
the
purpose
his
other
hand
toby
said
sikes
out
barney
the
man
went
to
the
door
and
returned
to
announce
that
all
was
quiet
the
two
robbers
issued
forth
with
oliver
between
them
barney
having
made
all
fast
rolled
himself
up
as
before
and
was
soon
asleep
again
it
was
now
intensely
dark
the
fog
was
much
heavier
than
it
had
been
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
and
the
atmosphere
was
so
damp
that
although
no
rain
fell
oliver
hair
and
eyebrows
within
a
few
minutes
after
leaving
the
house
had
become
stiff
with
the
moisture
that
was
floating
about
they
crossed
the
bridge
and
kept
on
towards
the
lights
which
he
had
seen
before
they
were
at
no
great
distance
off
and
as
they
walked
pretty
briskly
they
soon
arrived
at
chertsey
through
the
town
whispered
sikes
be
nobody
in
the
way
to
see
us
toby
acquiesced
and
they
hurried
through
the
main
street
of
the
little
town
which
at
that
late
hour
was
wholly
deserted
a
dim
light
shone
at
intervals
from
some
window
and
the
hoarse
barking
of
dogs
occasionally
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
but
there
was
nobody
abroad
they
had
cleared
the
town
as
the
struck
two
quickening
their
pace
they
turned
up
a
road
upon
the
left
hand
after
walking
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
they
stopped
before
a
detached
house
surrounded
by
a
wall
to
the
top
of
which
toby
crackit
scarcely
pausing
to
take
breath
climbed
in
a
twinkling
boy
next
said
toby
him
up
i
catch
hold
of
him
before
oliver
had
time
to
look
round
sikes
had
caught
him
under
the
arms
and
in
three
or
four
seconds
he
and
toby
were
lying
on
the
grass
on
the
other
side
sikes
followed
directly
and
they
stole
cautiously
towards
the
house
and
now
for
the
first
time
oliver
mad
with
grief
and
terror
saw
that
housebreaking
and
robbery
if
not
murder
were
the
objects
of
the
expedition
he
clasped
his
hands
together
and
involuntarily
uttered
a
subdued
exclamation
of
horror
a
mist
came
before
his
eyes
the
cold
sweat
stood
upon
his
ashy
face
his
limbs
failed
him
and
he
sank
upon
his
knees
up
murmured
sikes
trembling
with
rage
and
drawing
the
pistol
from
his
pocket
up
or
i
strew
your
brains
upon
the
grass
for
god
sake
let
me
go
cried
oliver
me
run
away
and
die
in
the
fields
i
will
never
come
near
london
never
never
oh
pray
have
mercy
on
me
and
do
not
make
me
steal
for
the
love
of
all
the
bright
angels
that
rest
in
heaven
have
mercy
upon
me
the
man
to
whom
this
appeal
was
made
swore
a
dreadful
oath
and
had
cocked
the
pistol
when
toby
striking
it
from
his
grasp
placed
his
hand
upon
the
boy
mouth
and
dragged
him
to
the
house
cried
the
man
wo
answer
here
say
another
word
and
i
do
your
business
myself
with
a
crack
on
the
head
that
makes
no
noise
and
is
quite
as
certain
and
more
genteel
here
bill
wrench
the
shutter
open
he
game
enough
now
i
engage
i
seen
older
hands
of
his
age
took
the
same
way
for
a
minute
or
two
on
a
cold
night
sikes
invoking
terrific
imprecations
upon
fagin
head
for
sending
oliver
on
such
an
errand
plied
the
crowbar
vigorously
but
with
little
noise
after
some
delay
and
some
assistance
from
toby
the
shutter
to
which
he
had
referred
swung
open
on
its
hinges
it
was
a
little
lattice
window
about
five
feet
and
a
half
above
the
ground
at
the
back
of
the
house
which
belonged
to
a
scullery
or
small
at
the
end
of
the
passage
the
aperture
was
so
small
that
the
inmates
had
probably
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
defend
it
more
securely
but
it
was
large
enough
to
admit
a
boy
of
oliver
size
nevertheless
a
very
brief
exercise
of
sike
art
sufficed
to
overcome
the
fastening
of
the
lattice
and
it
soon
stood
wide
open
also
listen
you
young
limb
whispered
sikes
drawing
a
dark
lantern
from
his
pocket
and
throwing
the
glare
full
on
oliver
face
a
going
to
put
you
through
there
take
this
light
go
softly
up
the
steps
straight
afore
you
and
along
the
little
hall
to
the
street

unfasten
it
and
let
us
in
a
bolt
at
the
top
you
wo
be
able
to
reach

toby
upon
one
of
the
hall
chairs
there
are
three

with
a
jolly
large
blue
unicorn
and
gold
pitchfork
on
which
is
the
old

quiet
ca
you
replied
sikes
with
a
threatening
look
is
open
is
it
replied
toby
after
peeping
in
to
satisfy
himself
game
of
that
is
that
they
always
leave
it
open
with
a
catch
so
that
the
dog
who
got
a
bed
in
here
may
walk
up
and
down
the
passage
when
he
feels
wakeful
ha
ha
barney
him
away
so
neat
although
crackit
spoke
in
a
scarcely
audible
whisper
and
laughed
without
noise
sikes
imperiously
commanded
him
to
be
silent
and
to
get
to
work
toby
complied
by
first
producing
his
lantern
and
placing
it
on
the
ground
then
by
planting
himself
firmly
with
his
head
against
the
wall
beneath
the
window
and
his
hands
upon
his
knees
so
as
to
make
a
step
of
his
back
this
was
no
sooner
done
than
sikes
mounting
upon
him
put
oliver
gently
through
the
window
with
his
feet
first
and
without
leaving
hold
of
his
collar
planted
him
safely
on
the
floor
inside
this
lantern
said
sikes
looking
into
the
room
see
the
stairs
afore
you
oliver
more
dead
than
alive
gasped
out
sikes
pointing
to
the
with
the
briefly
advised
him
to
take
notice
that
he
was
within
shot
all
the
way
and
that
if
he
faltered
he
would
fall
dead
that
instant
done
in
a
minute
said
sikes
in
the
same
low
whisper
i
leave
go
of
you
do
your
work
hark
that
whispered
the
other
man
they
listened
intently
said
sikes
releasing
his
hold
of
oliver
in
the
short
time
he
had
had
to
collect
his
senses
the
boy
had
firmly
resolved
that
whether
he
died
in
the
attempt
or
not
he
would
make
one
effort
to
dart
upstairs
from
the
hall
and
alarm
the
family
filled
with
this
idea
he
advanced
at
once
but
stealthily
back
suddenly
cried
sikes
aloud
back
scared
by
the
sudden
breaking
of
the
dead
stillness
of
the
place
and
by
a
loud
cry
which
followed
it
oliver
let
his
lantern
fall
and
knew
not
whether
to
advance
or
fly
the
cry
was
repeated
a
light
appeared
a
vision
of
two
terrified
men
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
swam
before
his
eyes
a
flash
a
loud
noise
a
smoke
a
crash
somewhere
but
where
he
knew
not
and
he
staggered
back
sikes
had
disappeared
for
an
instant
but
he
was
up
again
and
had
him
by
the
collar
before
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
he
fired
his
own
pistol
after
the
men
who
were
already
retreating
and
dragged
the
boy
up
your
arm
tighter
said
sikes
as
he
drew
him
through
the
window
me
a
shawl
here
they
hit
him
quick
how
the
boy
bleeds
then
came
the
loud
ringing
of
a
bell
mingled
with
the
noise
of
and
the
shouts
of
men
and
the
sensation
of
being
carried
over
uneven
ground
at
a
rapid
pace
and
then
the
noises
grew
confused
in
the
distance
and
a
cold
deadly
feeling
crept
over
the
boy
heart
and
he
saw
or
heard
no
more
chapter
xxiii
which
contains
the
substance
of
a
pleasant
conversation
between
bumble
and
a
lady
and
shows
that
even
a
beadle
may
be
susceptible
on
some
points
the
night
was
bitter
cold
the
snow
lay
on
the
ground
frozen
into
a
hard
thick
crust
so
that
only
the
heaps
that
had
drifted
into
byways
and
corners
were
affected
by
the
sharp
wind
that
howled
abroad
which
as
if
expending
increased
fury
on
such
prey
as
it
found
caught
it
savagely
up
in
clouds
and
whirling
it
into
a
thousand
misty
eddies
scattered
it
in
air
bleak
dark
and
piercing
cold
it
was
a
night
for
the
and
fed
to
draw
round
the
bright
fire
and
thank
god
they
were
at
home
and
for
the
homeless
starving
wretch
to
lay
him
down
and
die
many
outcasts
close
their
eyes
in
our
bare
streets
at
such
times
who
let
their
crimes
have
been
what
they
may
can
hardly
open
them
in
a
more
bitter
world
such
was
the
aspect
of
affairs
when
corney
the
matron
of
the
workhouse
to
which
our
readers
have
been
already
introduced
as
the
birthplace
of
oliver
twist
sat
herself
down
before
a
cheerful
fire
in
her
own
little
room
and
glanced
with
no
small
degree
of
complacency
at
a
small
round
table
on
which
stood
a
tray
of
corresponding
size
furnished
with
all
necessary
materials
for
the
most
grateful
meal
that
matrons
enjoy
in
fact
corney
was
about
to
solace
herself
with
a
cup
of
tea
as
she
glanced
from
the
table
to
the
fireplace
where
the
smallest
of
all
possible
kettles
was
singing
a
small
song
in
a
small
voice
her
inward
satisfaction
evidently
increased
so
much
so
indeed
that
corney
smiled
said
the
matron
leaning
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
looking
reflectively
at
the
fire
sure
we
have
all
on
us
a
great
deal
to
be
grateful
for
a
great
deal
if
we
did
but
know
it
ah
corney
shook
her
head
mournfully
as
if
deploring
the
mental
blindness
of
those
paupers
who
did
not
know
it
and
thrusting
a
silver
spoon
private
property
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
a
tin
proceeded
to
make
the
tea
how
slight
a
thing
will
disturb
the
equanimity
of
our
frail
minds
the
black
teapot
being
very
small
and
easily
filled
ran
over
while
corney
was
moralising
and
the
water
slightly
scalded
hand
the
pot
said
the
worthy
matron
setting
it
down
very
hastily
on
the
hob
little
stupid
thing
that
only
holds
a
couple
of
cups
what
use
is
it
of
to
anybody
except
said
corney
pausing
to
a
poor
desolate
creature
like
me
oh
dear
with
these
words
the
matron
dropped
into
her
chair
and
once
more
resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
thought
of
her
solitary
fate
the
small
teapot
and
the
single
cup
had
awakened
in
her
mind
sad
recollections
of
corney
who
had
not
been
dead
more
than
years
and
she
was
overpowered
shall
never
get
another
said
corney
pettishly
shall
never
get
another
like
him
whether
this
remark
bore
reference
to
the
husband
or
the
teapot
is
uncertain
it
might
have
been
the
latter
for
corney
looked
at
it
as
she
spoke
and
took
it
up
afterwards
she
had
just
tasted
her
first
cup
when
she
was
disturbed
by
a
soft
tap
at
the
come
in
with
you
said
corney
sharply
of
the
old
women
dying
i
suppose
they
always
die
when
i
at
meals
do
stand
there
letting
the
cold
air
in
do
what
amiss
now
eh
nothing
replied
a
man
voice
me
exclaimed
the
matron
in
a
much
sweeter
tone
that
mr
bumble
your
service
said
bumble
who
had
been
stopping
outside
to
rub
his
shoes
clean
and
to
shake
the
snow
off
his
coat
and
who
now
made
his
appearance
bearing
the
cocked
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
bundle
in
the
other
i
shut
the
door
the
lady
modestly
hesitated
to
reply
lest
there
should
be
any
impropriety
in
holding
an
interview
with
bumble
with
closed
doors
bumble
taking
advantage
of
the
hesitation
and
being
very
cold
himself
shut
it
without
permission
weather
bumble
said
the
matron
indeed
replied
the
beadle
weather
this
we
have
given
away
corney
we
have
given
away
a
matter
of
twenty
quartern
loaves
and
a
cheese
and
a
half
this
very
blessed
afternoon
and
yet
them
paupers
are
not
contented
course
not
when
would
they
be
mr
bumble
said
the
matron
sipping
her
tea
indeed
rejoined
bumble
here
one
man
that
in
consideration
of
his
wife
and
large
family
has
a
quartern
loaf
and
a
good
pound
of
cheese
full
weight
is
he
grateful
is
he
grateful
not
a
copper
farthing
worth
of
it
what
does
he
do
but
ask
for
a
few
coals
if
it
only
a
pocket
handkerchief
full
he
says
coals
what
would
he
do
with
coals
toast
his
cheese
with
and
then
come
back
for
more
that
the
way
with
these
people
give
a
apron
full
of
coals
and
they
come
back
for
another
the
day
after
as
brazen
as
alabaster
the
matron
expressed
her
entire
concurrence
in
this
intelligible
simile
and
the
beadle
went
on
never
said
bumble
anything
like
the
pitch
it
got
to
the
day
afore
yesterday
a
man
you
have
been
a
married
woman
and
i
may
mention
it
to
you
a
man
with
hardly
a
rag
upon
his
back
here
corney
looked
at
the
floor
goes
to
our
overseer
door
when
he
has
got
company
coming
to
dinner
and
says
he
must
be
relieved
corney
as
he
would
go
away
and
shocked
the
company
very
much
our
overseer
sent
him
out
a
pound
of
potatoes
and
half
a
pint
of
oatmeal
my
heart
says
the
ungrateful
villain
what
the
use
of
to
me
you
might
as
well
give
me
a
pair
of
iron
spectacles
very
good
says
our
overseer
taking
away
again
you
wo
get
anything
else
here
then
i
die
in
the
streets
says
the
vagrant
oh
no
you
wo
says
our
overseer
ha
that
was
very
good
so
like
grannett
was
it
interposed
the
matron
mr
bumble
rejoined
the
beadle
went
away
and
he
die
in
the
streets
there
a
obstinate
pauper
for
you
beats
anything
i
could
have
believed
observed
the
matron
emphatically
do
you
think
relief
a
very
bad
thing
any
way
bumble
you
a
gentleman
of
experience
and
ought
to
know
come
corney
said
the
beadle
smiling
as
men
smile
who
are
conscious
of
superior
information
relief
properly
managed
properly
managed
is
the
porochial
safeguard
the
great
principle
of
relief
is
to
give
the
paupers
exactly
what
they
do
want
and
then
they
get
tired
of
coming
me
exclaimed
corney
that
is
a
good
one
too
betwixt
you
and
me
returned
bumble
the
great
principle
and
that
the
reason
why
if
you
look
at
any
cases
that
get
into
them
owdacious
newspapers
you
always
observe
that
sick
families
have
been
relieved
with
slices
of
cheese
that
the
rule
now
corney
all
over
the
country
but
however
said
the
beadle
stopping
to
unpack
his
bundle
are
official
secrets
not
to
be
spoken
of
except
as
i
may
say
among
the
porochial
officers
such
as
ourselves
this
is
the
port
wine
that
the
board
ordered
for
the
infirmary
real
fresh
genuine
port
wine
only
out
of
the
cask
this
forenoon
clear
as
a
bell
and
no
sediment
having
held
the
first
bottle
up
to
the
light
and
shaken
it
well
to
test
its
excellence
bumble
placed
them
both
on
top
of
a
chest
of
drawers
folded
the
handkerchief
in
which
they
had
been
wrapped
put
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
and
took
up
his
hat
as
if
to
go
have
a
very
cold
walk
bumble
said
the
matron
blows
replied
bumble
turning
up
his
to
cut
one
ears
off
the
matron
looked
from
the
little
kettle
to
the
beadle
who
was
moving
towards
the
door
and
as
the
beadle
coughed
preparatory
to
bidding
her
bashfully
inquired
whether
whether
he
take
a
cup
of
tea
bumble
instantaneously
turned
back
his
collar
again
laid
his
hat
and
stick
upon
a
chair
and
drew
another
chair
up
to
the
table
as
he
slowly
seated
himself
he
looked
at
the
lady
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
little
teapot
bumble
coughed
again
and
slightly
smiled
corney
rose
to
get
another
cup
and
saucer
from
the
closet
as
she
sat
down
her
eyes
once
again
encountered
those
of
the
gallant
beadle
she
coloured
and
applied
herself
to
the
task
of
making
his
tea
again
bumble
coughed
louder
this
time
than
he
had
coughed
yet
mr
bumble
inquired
the
matron
taking
up
the
sweet
indeed
replied
bumble
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
corney
as
he
said
this
and
if
ever
a
beadle
looked
tender
bumble
was
that
beadle
at
that
moment
the
tea
was
made
and
handed
in
silence
bumble
having
spread
a
handkerchief
over
his
knees
to
prevent
the
crumbs
from
sullying
the
splendour
of
his
shorts
began
to
eat
and
drink
varying
these
amusements
occasionally
by
fetching
a
deep
sigh
which
however
had
no
injurious
effect
upon
his
appetite
but
on
the
contrary
rather
seemed
to
facilitate
his
operations
in
the
tea
and
toast
department
have
a
cat
i
see
said
bumble
glancing
at
one
who
in
the
centre
of
her
family
was
basking
before
the
fire
kittens
too
i
declare
am
so
fond
of
them
bumble
you
ca
think
replied
the
matron
happy
frolicsome
and
cheerful
that
they
are
quite
companions
for
me
nice
animals
replied
bumble
approvingly
very
domestic
yes
rejoined
the
matron
with
enthusiasm
fond
of
their
home
too
that
it
quite
a
pleasure
i
sure
corney
said
bumble
slowly
and
marking
the
time
with
his
teaspoon
mean
to
say
this
that
any
cat
or
kitten
that
could
live
with
you
and
be
fond
of
its
home
must
be
a
ass
mr
bumble
remonstrated
corney
of
no
use
disguising
facts
said
bumble
slowly
flourishing
the
teaspoon
with
a
kind
of
amorous
dignity
which
made
him
doubly
impressive
would
drown
it
myself
with
pleasure
you
a
cruel
man
said
the
matron
vivaciously
as
she
held
out
her
hand
for
the
beadle
cup
a
very
man
besides
said
bumble
bumble
resigned
his
cup
without
another
word
squeezed
corney
little
finger
as
she
took
it
and
inflicting
two
slaps
upon
his
laced
waistcoat
gave
a
mighty
sigh
and
hitched
his
chair
a
very
little
morsel
farther
from
the
fire
it
was
a
round
table
and
as
corney
and
bumble
had
been
sitting
opposite
each
other
with
no
great
space
between
them
and
fronting
the
fire
it
will
be
seen
that
bumble
in
receding
from
the
fire
and
still
keeping
at
the
table
increased
the
distance
between
himself
and
corney
which
proceeding
some
prudent
readers
will
doubtless
be
disposed
to
admire
and
to
consider
an
act
of
great
heroism
on
bumble
part
he
being
in
some
sort
tempted
by
time
place
and
opportunity
to
give
utterance
to
certain
soft
nothings
which
however
well
they
may
become
the
lips
of
the
light
and
thoughtless
do
seem
immeasurably
beneath
the
dignity
of
judges
of
the
land
members
of
parliament
ministers
of
state
lord
mayors
and
other
great
public
functionaries
but
more
particularly
beneath
the
stateliness
and
gravity
of
a
beadle
who
as
is
well
known
should
be
the
sternest
and
most
inflexible
among
them
all
whatever
were
bumble
intentions
however
and
no
doubt
they
were
of
the
best
it
unfortunately
happened
as
has
been
twice
before
remarked
that
the
table
was
a
round
one
consequently
bumble
moving
his
chair
by
little
and
little
soon
began
to
diminish
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
matron
and
continuing
to
travel
round
the
outer
edge
of
the
circle
brought
his
chair
in
time
close
to
that
in
which
the
matron
was
seated
indeed
the
two
chairs
touched
and
when
they
did
so
bumble
stopped
now
if
the
matron
had
moved
her
chair
to
the
right
she
would
have
been
scorched
by
the
fire
and
if
to
the
left
she
must
have
fallen
into
bumble
arms
so
being
a
discreet
matron
and
no
doubt
foreseeing
these
consequences
at
a
glance
she
remained
where
she
was
and
handed
bumble
another
cup
of
tea
mrs
corney
said
bumble
stirring
his
tea
and
looking
up
into
the
matron
face
mrs
corney
me
exclaimed
the
matron
a
very
curious
question
from
a
single
man
what
can
you
want
to
know
for
mr
bumble
the
beadle
drank
his
tea
to
the
last
drop
finished
a
piece
of
toast
whisked
the
crumbs
off
his
knees
wiped
his
lips
and
deliberately
kissed
the
matron
bumble
cried
that
discreet
lady
in
a
whisper
for
the
fright
was
so
great
that
she
had
quite
lost
her
voice
bumble
i
shall
scream
bumble
made
no
reply
but
in
a
slow
and
dignified
manner
put
his
arm
round
the
matron
waist
as
the
lady
had
stated
her
intention
of
screaming
of
course
she
would
have
screamed
at
this
additional
boldness
but
that
the
exertion
was
rendered
unnecessary
by
a
hasty
knocking
at
the
door
which
was
no
sooner
heard
than
bumble
darted
with
much
agility
to
the
wine
bottles
and
began
dusting
them
with
great
violence
while
the
matron
sharply
demanded
who
was
there
it
is
worthy
of
remark
as
a
curious
physical
instance
of
the
efficacy
of
a
sudden
surprise
in
counteracting
the
effects
of
extreme
fear
that
her
voice
had
quite
recovered
all
its
official
asperity
you
please
mistress
said
a
withered
old
female
pauper
hideously
ugly
putting
her
head
in
at
the
door
sally
is
fast
what
that
to
me
angrily
demanded
the
matron
ca
keep
her
alive
can
i
no
mistress
replied
the
old
woman
can
she
far
beyond
the
reach
of
help
i
seen
a
many
people
die
little
babes
and
great
strong
men
and
i
know
when
death
well
enough
but
she
troubled
in
her
mind
and
when
the
fits
are
not
on
her
and
that
not
often
for
she
is
dying
very
hard
she
says
she
has
got
something
to
tell
which
you
must
hear
she
never
die
quiet
till
you
come
mistress
at
this
intelligence
the
worthy
corney
muttered
a
variety
of
invectives
against
old
women
who
could
even
die
without
purposely
annoying
their
betters
and
muffling
herself
in
a
thick
shawl
which
she
hastily
caught
up
briefly
requested
bumble
to
stay
till
she
came
back
lest
anything
particular
should
occur
bidding
the
messenger
walk
fast
and
not
be
all
night
hobbling
up
the
stairs
she
followed
her
from
the
room
with
a
very
ill
grace
scolding
all
the
way
bumble
conduct
on
being
left
to
himself
was
rather
inexplicable
he
opened
the
closet
counted
the
teaspoons
weighed
the
closely
inspected
a
silver
to
ascertain
that
it
was
of
the
genuine
metal
and
having
satisfied
his
curiosity
on
these
points
put
on
his
cocked
hat
and
danced
with
much
gravity
four
distinct
times
round
the
table
having
gone
through
this
very
extraordinary
performance
he
took
off
the
cocked
hat
again
and
spreading
himself
before
the
fire
with
his
back
towards
it
seemed
to
be
mentally
engaged
in
taking
an
exact
inventory
of
the
furniture
chapter
xxiv
treats
on
a
very
poor
subject
but
is
a
short
one
and
may
be
found
of
importance
in
this
history
it
was
no
unfit
messenger
of
death
who
had
disturbed
the
quiet
of
the
matron
room
her
body
was
bent
by
age
her
limbs
trembled
with
palsy
her
face
distorted
into
a
mumbling
leer
resembled
more
the
grotesque
shaping
of
some
wild
pencil
than
the
work
of
nature
hand
alas
how
few
of
nature
faces
are
left
alone
to
gladden
us
with
their
beauty
the
cares
and
sorrows
and
hungerings
of
the
world
change
them
as
they
change
hearts
and
it
is
only
when
those
passions
sleep
and
have
lost
their
hold
for
ever
that
the
troubled
clouds
pass
off
and
leave
heaven
surface
clear
it
is
a
common
thing
for
the
countenances
of
the
dead
even
in
that
fixed
and
rigid
state
to
subside
into
the
expression
of
sleeping
infancy
and
settle
into
the
very
look
of
early
life
so
calm
so
peaceful
do
they
grow
again
that
those
who
knew
them
in
their
happy
childhood
kneel
by
the
coffin
side
in
awe
and
see
the
angel
even
upon
earth
the
old
crone
tottered
along
the
passages
and
up
the
stairs
muttering
some
indistinct
answers
to
the
chidings
of
her
companion
being
at
length
compelled
to
pause
for
breath
she
gave
the
light
into
her
hand
and
remained
behind
to
follow
as
she
might
while
the
more
nimble
superior
made
her
way
to
the
room
where
the
sick
woman
lay
it
was
a
bare
with
a
dim
light
burning
at
the
farther
end
there
was
another
old
woman
watching
by
the
bed
the
parish
apothecary
apprentice
was
standing
by
the
fire
making
a
toothpick
out
of
a
quill
night
corney
said
this
young
gentleman
as
the
matron
entered
cold
indeed
sir
replied
the
mistress
in
her
most
civil
tones
and
dropping
a
curtsey
as
she
spoke
should
get
better
coals
out
of
your
contractors
said
the
apothecary
deputy
breaking
a
lump
on
the
top
of
the
fire
with
the
rusty
poker
are
not
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
for
a
cold
night
the
board
choosing
sir
returned
the
matron
least
they
could
do
would
be
to
keep
us
pretty
warm
for
our
places
are
hard
enough
the
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
a
moan
from
the
sick
woman
said
the
young
mag
turning
his
face
towards
the
bed
as
if
he
had
previously
quite
forgotten
the
patient
all
there
mrs
corney
is
is
it
sir
asked
the
matron
she
lasts
a
couple
of
hours
i
shall
be
surprised
said
the
apothecary
apprentice
intent
upon
the
toothpick
point
a
of
the
system
altogether
is
she
dozing
old
lady
the
attendant
stooped
over
the
bed
to
ascertain
and
nodded
in
the
affirmative
perhaps
she
go
off
in
that
way
if
you
do
make
a
row
said
the
young
man
the
light
on
the
floor
she
wo
see
it
there
the
attendant
did
as
she
was
told
shaking
her
head
meanwhile
to
intimate
that
the
woman
would
not
die
so
easily
having
done
so
she
resumed
her
seat
by
the
side
of
the
other
nurse
who
had
by
this
time
returned
the
mistress
with
an
expression
of
impatience
wrapped
herself
in
her
shawl
and
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
apothecary
apprentice
having
completed
the
manufacture
of
the
toothpick
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
fire
and
made
good
use
of
it
for
ten
minutes
or
so
when
apparently
growing
rather
dull
he
wished
corney
joy
of
her
job
and
took
himself
off
on
tiptoe
when
they
had
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
the
two
old
women
rose
from
the
bed
and
crouching
over
the
fire
held
out
their
withered
hands
to
catch
the
heat
the
flame
threw
a
ghastly
light
on
their
shrivelled
faces
and
made
their
ugliness
appear
terrible
as
in
this
position
they
began
to
converse
in
a
low
voice
she
say
any
more
anny
dear
while
i
was
gone
inquired
the
messenger
a
word
replied
the
other
plucked
and
tore
at
her
arms
for
a
little
time
but
i
held
her
hands
and
she
soon
dropped
off
she
has
much
strength
in
her
so
i
easily
kept
her
quiet
i
ai
so
weak
for
an
old
woman
although
i
am
on
parish
allowance
no
no
she
drink
the
hot
wine
the
doctor
said
she
was
to
have
demanded
the
first
tried
to
get
it
down
rejoined
the
other
her
teeth
were
tight
set
and
she
clenched
the
mug
so
hard
that
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
get
it
back
again
so
i
drank
it
and
it
did
me
good
looking
cautiously
round
to
ascertain
that
they
were
not
overheard
the
two
hags
cowered
nearer
to
the
fire
and
chuckled
heartily
mind
the
time
said
the
first
speaker
she
would
have
done
the
same
and
made
rare
fun
of
it
afterwards
that
she
would
rejoined
the
other
had
a
merry
heart
many
many
beautiful
corpses
she
laid
out
as
nice
and
neat
as
waxwork
my
old
eyes
have
seen
them
ay
and
those
old
hands
touched
them
too
for
i
have
helped
her
scores
of
times
stretching
forth
her
trembling
fingers
as
she
spoke
the
old
creature
shook
them
exultingly
before
her
face
and
fumbling
in
her
pocket
brought
out
an
old
tin
from
which
she
shook
a
few
grains
into
the
outstretched
palm
of
her
companion
and
a
few
more
into
her
own
while
they
were
thus
employed
the
matron
who
had
been
impatiently
watching
until
the
dying
woman
should
awaken
from
her
stupor
joined
them
by
the
fire
and
sharply
asked
how
long
she
was
to
wait
long
mistress
replied
the
second
woman
looking
up
into
her
face
have
none
of
us
long
to
wait
for
death
patience
patience
he
be
here
soon
enough
for
us
all
your
tongue
you
doting
idiot
said
the
matron
sternly
martha
tell
me
has
she
been
in
this
way
before
answered
the
first
woman
will
never
be
again
added
the
second
one
is
she
never
wake
again
but
once
and
mind
mistress
that
wo
be
for
long
or
short
said
the
matron
snappishly
wo
find
me
here
when
she
does
wake
take
care
both
of
you
how
you
worry
me
again
for
nothing
it
no
part
of
my
duty
to
see
all
the
old
women
in
the
house
die
and
i
wo
that
more
mind
that
you
impudent
old
harridans
if
you
make
a
fool
of
me
again
i
soon
cure
you
i
warrant
you
she
was
bouncing
away
when
a
cry
from
the
two
women
who
had
turned
towards
the
bed
caused
her
to
look
round
the
patient
had
raised
herself
upright
and
was
stretching
her
arms
towards
them
that
she
cried
in
a
hollow
voice
hush
said
one
of
the
women
stooping
over
her
down
lie
down
never
lie
down
again
alive
said
the
woman
struggling
tell
her
come
here
nearer
let
me
whisper
in
your
ear
she
clutched
the
matron
by
the
arm
and
forcing
her
into
a
chair
by
the
bedside
was
about
to
speak
when
looking
round
she
caught
sight
of
the
two
old
women
bending
forward
in
the
attitude
of
eager
listeners
them
away
said
the
woman
drowsily
haste
make
haste
the
two
old
crones
chiming
in
together
began
pouring
out
many
piteous
lamentations
that
the
poor
dear
was
too
far
gone
to
know
her
best
friends
and
were
uttering
sundry
protestations
that
they
would
never
leave
her
when
the
superior
pushed
them
from
the
room
closed
the
door
and
returned
to
the
bedside
on
being
excluded
the
old
ladies
changed
their
tone
and
cried
through
the
keyhole
that
old
sally
was
drunk
which
indeed
was
not
unlikely
since
in
addition
to
a
moderate
dose
of
opium
prescribed
by
the
apothecary
she
was
labouring
under
the
effects
of
a
final
taste
of
which
had
been
privily
administered
in
the
openness
of
their
hearts
by
the
worthy
old
ladies
themselves
listen
to
me
said
the
dying
woman
aloud
as
if
making
a
great
effort
to
revive
one
latent
spark
of
energy
this
very
room
in
this
very
bed
i
once
nursed
a
pretty
young
creetur
that
was
brought
into
the
house
with
her
feet
cut
and
bruised
with
walking
and
all
soiled
with
dust
and
blood
she
gave
birth
to
a
boy
and
died
let
me
think
what
was
the
year
again
mind
the
year
said
the
impatient
auditor
about
her
murmured
the
sick
woman
relapsing
into
her
former
drowsy
state
about
her
what
about
i
know
she
cried
jumping
fiercely
up
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
starting
from
her
head
robbed
her
so
i
did
she
was
cold
i
tell
you
she
was
cold
when
i
stole
it
what
for
god
sake
cried
the
matron
with
a
gesture
as
if
she
would
call
for
help
replied
the
woman
laying
her
hand
over
the
other
mouth
only
thing
she
had
she
wanted
clothes
to
keep
her
warm
and
food
to
eat
but
she
had
kept
it
safe
and
had
it
in
her
bosom
it
was
gold
i
tell
you
rich
gold
that
might
have
saved
her
life
echoed
the
matron
bending
eagerly
over
the
woman
as
she
fell
back
on
go
on
yes
what
of
it
who
was
the
mother
when
was
it
charged
me
to
keep
it
safe
replied
the
woman
with
a
groan
trusted
me
as
the
only
woman
about
her
i
stole
it
in
my
heart
when
she
first
showed
it
me
hanging
round
her
neck
and
the
child
death
perhaps
is
on
me
besides
they
would
have
treated
him
better
if
they
had
known
it
all
what
asked
the
other
boy
grew
so
like
his
mother
said
the
woman
rambling
on
and
not
heeding
the
question
i
could
never
forget
it
when
i
saw
his
face
poor
girl
poor
girl
she
was
so
young
too
such
a
gentle
lamb
wait
there
more
to
tell
i
have
not
told
you
all
have
i
no
replied
the
matron
inclining
her
head
to
catch
the
words
as
they
came
more
faintly
from
the
dying
woman
quick
or
it
may
be
too
late
mother
said
the
woman
making
a
more
violent
effort
than
before
mother
when
the
pains
of
death
first
came
upon
her
whispered
in
my
ear
that
if
her
baby
was
born
alive
and
thrived
the
day
might
come
when
it
would
not
feel
so
much
disgraced
to
hear
its
poor
young
mother
named
and
oh
kind
heaven
she
said
folding
her
thin
hands
together
whether
it
be
boy
or
girl
raise
up
some
friends
for
it
in
this
troubled
world
and
take
pity
upon
a
lonely
desolate
child
abandoned
to
its
mercy
boy
name
demanded
the
matron
him
oliver
replied
the
woman
feebly
gold
i
stole
was
yes
what
cried
the
other
she
was
bending
eagerly
over
the
woman
to
hear
her
reply
but
drew
back
instinctively
as
she
once
again
rose
slowly
and
stiffly
into
a
sitting
posture
then
clutching
the
coverlid
with
both
hands
muttered
some
indistinct
sounds
in
her
throat
and
fell
lifeless
on
the
bed
dead
said
one
of
the
old
women
hurrying
in
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
nothing
to
tell
after
all
rejoined
the
matron
walking
carelessly
away
the
two
crones
to
all
appearance
too
busily
occupied
in
the
preparations
for
their
dreadful
duties
to
make
any
reply
were
left
alone
hovering
about
the
body

in

the

from

over

he
had

to
rouse

he
had
fallen
into

with
his

on
them

his

peculiarly
intelligent
at
all
times
acquired
great
additional
interest
from
his
close
observance
of
the
game
and
his
attentive
perusal
of
chitling
hand
upon
which
from
time
to
time
as
occasion
served
he
bestowed
a
variety
of
earnest
glances
wisely
regulating
his
own
play
by
the
result
of
his
observations
upon
his
neighbour
cards
it
being
a
cold
night
the
dodger
wore
his
hat
as
indeed
was
often
his
custom
within
doors
he
also
sustained
a
clay
pipe
between
his
teeth
which
he
only
removed
for
a
brief
space
when
he
deemed
it
necessary
to
apply
for
refreshment
to
a
quart
pot
upon
the
table
which
stood
ready
filled
with
for
the
accommodation
of
the
company
master
bates
was
also
attentive
to
the
play
but
being
of
a
more
excitable
nature
than
his
accomplished
friend
it
was
observable
that
he
more
frequently
applied
himself
to
the
and
moreover
indulged
in
many
jests
and
irrelevant
remarks
all
highly
unbecoming
a
scientific
rubber
indeed
the
artful
presuming
upon
their
close
attachment
more
than
once
took
occasion
to
reason
gravely
with
his
companion
upon
these
improprieties
all
of
which
remonstrances
master
bates
received
in
extremely
good
part
merely
requesting
his
friend
to
be
or
to
insert
his
head
in
a
sack
or
replying
with
some
other
witticism
of
a
similar
kind
the
happy
application
of
which
excited
considerable
admiration
in
the
mind
of
chitling
it
was
remarkable
that
the
latter
gentleman
and
his
partner
invariably
lost
and
that
the
circumstance
so
far
from
angering
master
bates
appeared
to
afford
him
the
highest
amusement
inasmuch
as
he
laughed
most
uproariously
at
the
end
of
every
deal
and
protested
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
jolly
game
in
all
his
born
days
two
doubles
and
the
rub
said
chitling
with
a
very
long
face
as
he
drew
from
his
never
see
such
a
feller
as
you
jack
you
win
everything
even
when
we
good
cards
charley
and
i
ca
make
nothing
of
either
the
master
or
the
manner
of
this
remark
which
was
made
very
ruefully
delighted
charley
bates
so
much
that
his
consequent
shout
of
laughter
roused
the
jew
from
his
reverie
and
induced
him
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
fagin
cried
charley
wish
you
had
watched
the
play
tommy
chitling
has
won
a
point
and
i
went
partners
with
him
against
the
artfull
and
dumb
ay
said
the
jew
with
a
grin
which
sufficiently
demonstrated
that
he
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
the
reason
again
tom
try
again
more
of
it
for
me
thank
fagin
replied
chitling
had
enough
that
dodger
has
such
a
run
of
luck
that
there
no
standing
again
him
ha
my
dear
replied
the
jew
must
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
to
win
against
the
dodger
said
charley
bates
must
put
your
boots
on
and
have
a
telescope
at
each
eye
and
a
between
your
shoulders
if
you
want
to
come
over
him
dawkins
received
these
handsome
compliments
with
much
philosophy
and
offered
to
cut
any
gentleman
in
company
for
the
first
at
a
shilling
at
a
time
nobody
accepting
the
challenge
and
his
pipe
being
by
this
time
smoked
out
he
proceeded
to
amuse
himself
by
sketching
a
of
newgate
on
the
table
with
the
piece
of
chalk
which
had
served
him
in
lieu
of
counters
whistling
meantime
with
peculiar
shrillness
precious
dull
you
are
tommy
said
the
dodger
stopping
short
when
there
had
been
a
long
silence
and
addressing
chitling
do
you
think
he
thinking
of
fagin
should
i
know
my
dear
replied
the
jew
looking
round
as
he
plied
the
bellows
his
losses
maybe
or
the
little
retirement
in
the
country
that
he
just
left
eh
ha
ha
is
that
it
my
dear
a
bit
of
it
replied
the
dodger
stopping
the
subject
of
discourse
as
chitling
was
about
to
reply
do
say
charley
should
say
replied
master
bates
with
a
grin
he
was
uncommon
sweet
upon
betsy
see
how
he
oh
my
eye
here
a
tommy
chitling
in
love
oh
fagin
fagin
what
a
spree
thoroughly
overpowered
with
the
notion
of
chitling
being
the
victim
of
the
tender
passion
master
bates
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
with
such
violence
that
he
lost
his
balance
and
pitched
over
upon
the
floor
where
the
accident
abating
nothing
of
his
merriment
he
lay
at
full
length
until
his
laugh
was
over
when
he
resumed
his
former
position
and
began
another
laugh
mind
him
my
dear
said
the
jew
winking
at
dawkins
and
giving
master
bates
a
reproving
tap
with
the
nozzle
of
the
bellows
a
fine
girl
stick
up
to
her
tom
stick
up
to
her
i
mean
to
say

replied
chitling
very
red
in
the
face
that
that
is
anything
to
anybody
here
more
it
is
replied
the
jew
will
talk

a
fine
girl
do
as
she
bids
you

and
you
will
make
your
fortune
i
do
as
she
bids
me
replied
chitling
should
have
been
milled
if
it
had
been
for
her
advice
but
it
turned
out
a
good
job
for
you
did
it
fagin
and
what
six
weeks
of
it
it
must
come
some
time
or
another
and
why
not
in
the
winter
time
when
you
do
want
to
go
out
so
much
eh
fagin
to
be
sure
my
dear
replied
the
jew
would
mind
it
again
tom
would
you
asked
the
dodger
winking
upon
charley
and
the
jew
bet
was
all
right
mean
to
say
that
i
should
replied
tom
angrily
now
ah
who
say
as
much
as
that
i
should
like
to
know
eh
fagin
my
dear
replied
the
jew
a
soul
tom
i
do
know
one
of
that
would
do
it
besides
you
not
one
of
my
dear
might
have
got
clear

if
i
split
upon
her
might
i
fagin
angrily
pursued
the
poor
dupe
word
from
me
would
have
done
it
would
it
fagin
be
sure
it
would
my
dear
replied
the
jew
i
did
blab
it
did
i
fagin
demanded
tom
pouring
question
upon
question
with
great
volubility
no
to
be
sure
replied
the
jew
were
too
for
that
a
deal
too
stout
my
dear
i
was
rejoined
tom
looking
round
if
i
was
what
to
laugh
at
in
that
eh
fagin
the
jew
perceiving
that
chitling
was
considerably
roused
hastened
to
assure
him
that
nobody
was
laughing
and
to
prove
the
gravity
of
the
company
appealed
to
master
bates
the
principal
offender
but
unfortunately
charley
in
opening
his
mouth
to
reply
that
he
was
never
more
serious
in
his
life
was
unable
to
prevent
the
escape
of
such
a
violent
roar
that
the
abused
chitling
without
any
preliminary
ceremonies
rushed
across
the
room
and
aimed
a
blow
at
the
offender
who
being
skilful
in
evading
pursuit
ducked
to
avoid
it
and
chose
his
time
so
well
that
it
lighted
on
the
chest
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
and
caused
him
to
stagger
to
the
wall
where
he
stood
panting
for
breath
while
chitling
looked
on
in
intense
dismay
cried
the
dodger
at
this
moment
heard
the
tinkler
catching
up
the
light
he
crept
softly
upstairs
the
bell
was
rung
again
with
some
impatience
while
the
party
were
in
darkness
after
a
short
pause
the
dodger
reappeared
and
whispered
fagin
mysteriously
cried
the
jew
the
dodger
nodded
in
the
affirmative
and
shading
the
flame
of
the
candle
with
his
hand
gave
charley
bates
a
private
intimation
in
dumb
show
that
he
had
better
not
be
funny
just
then
having
performed
this
friendly
office
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
jew
face
and
awaited
his
directions
the
old
man
bit
his
yellow
fingers
and
meditated
for
some
seconds
his
face
working
with
agitation
the
while
as
if
he
dreaded
something
and
feared
to
know
the
worst
at
length
he
raised
his
head
is
he
he
asked
the
dodger
pointed
to
the
floor
above
and
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
leave
the
room
said
the
jew
answering
the
mute
inquiry
him
down
hush
quiet
charley
gently
tom
scarce
scarce
this
brief
direction
to
charley
bates
and
his
recent
antagonist
was
softly
and
immediately
obeyed
there
was
no
sound
of
their
whereabout
when
the
dodger
descended
the
stairs
bearing
the
light
in
his
hand
and
followed
by
a
man
in
a
coarse
who
after
casting
a
hurried
glance
round
the
room
pulled
off
a
large
wrapper
which
had
concealed
the
lower
portion
of
his
face
and
disclosed
all
haggard
unwashed
and
unshorn
the
features
of
flash
toby
crackit
are
you
faguey
said
this
worthy
nodding
to
the
jew
that
shawl
away
in
my
castor
dodger
so
that
i
may
know
where
to
find
it
when
i
cut
that
the
time
of
day
you
be
a
fine
young
cracksman
afore
the
old
file
now
with
these
words
he
pulled
up
the
and
winding
it
round
his
middle
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
placed
his
feet
upon
the
hob
there
faguey
he
said
pointing
disconsolately
to
his
top
boots
a
drop
of
day
and
martin
since
you
know
when
not
a
bubble
of
blacking
by
jove
but
do
look
at
me
in
that
way
man
all
in
good
time
i
ca
talk
about
business
till
i
eat
and
drank
so
produce
the
sustainance
and
let
have
a
quiet
for
the
first
time
these
three
days
the
jew
motioned
to
the
dodger
to
place
what
eatables
there
were
upon
the
table
and
seating
himself
opposite
the
housebreaker
waited
his
leisure
to
judge
from
appearances
toby
was
by
no
means
in
a
hurry
to
open
the
conversation
at
first
the
jew
contented
himself
with
patiently
watching
his
countenance
as
if
to
gain
from
its
expression
some
clue
to
the
intelligence
he
brought
but
in
vain
he
looked
tired
and
worn
but
there
was
the
same
complacent
repose
upon
his
features
that
they
always
wore
and
through
dirt
and
beard
and
whisker
there
still
shone
unimpaired
the
smirk
of
flash
toby
crackit
then
the
jew
in
an
agony
of
impatience
watched
every
morsel
he
put
into
his
mouth
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
meanwhile
in
irrepressible
excitement
it
was
all
of
no
use
toby
continued
to
eat
with
the
utmost
outward
indifference
until
he
could
eat
no
more
then
ordering
the
dodger
out
he
closed
the
door
mixed
a
glass
of
spirits
and
water
and
composed
himself
for
talking
and
foremost
faguey
said
toby
yes
interposed
the
jew
drawing
up
his
chair
crackit
stopped
to
take
a
draught
of
spirits
and
water
and
to
declare
that
the
gin
was
excellent
then
placing
his
feet
against
the
low
mantelpiece
so
as
to
bring
his
boots
to
about
the
level
of
his
eye
he
quietly
resumed
and
foremost
faguey
said
the
housebreaker
bill
screamed
the
jew
starting
from
his
seat
you
do
mean
to
say
began
toby
turning
pale
cried
the
jew
stamping
furiously
on
the
ground
are
they
sikes
and
the
boy
where

where
have
they
been
where
are
they
hiding

said
toby
faintly

it
replied
the
jew
tearing
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
and
pointing
to
it
more
fired
and
hit
the
boy
we
cut
over
the
fields
at
the
back
with
him
between
us
straight
as
the
crow
flies
through
hedge
and
ditch
they
gave
chase
damme
the
whole
country
was
awake
and
the
dogs
upon
us
boy
had
him
on
his
back
and
scudded
like
the
wind
we
stopped
to
take
him
between
us
his
head
hung
down
and
he
was
cold
they
were
close
upon
our
heels
every
man
for
himself
and
each
from
the
gallows
we
parted
company
and
left
the
youngster
lying
in
a
ditch
alive
or
dead
that
all
i
know
about
him
the
jew
stopped
to
hear
no
more
but
uttering
a
loud
yell
and
twining
his
hands
in
his
hair
rushed
from
the
room
and
from
the
house
chapter
xxvi
in
which
a
mysterious
character
appears
upon
the
scene
and
many
things
inseparable
from
this
history
are
done
and
performed
the
old
man
had
gained
the
street
corner
before
he
began
to
recover
the
effect
of
toby
crackit
intelligence
he
had
relaxed
nothing
of
his
unusual
speed
but
was
still
pressing
onward
in
the
same
wild
and
disordered
manner
when
the
sudden
dashing
past
of
a
carriage
and
a
boisterous
cry
from
the
foot
passengers
who
saw
his
danger
drove
him
back
upon
the
pavement
avoiding
as
much
as
was
possible
all
the
main
streets
and
skulking
only
through
the
and
alleys
he
at
length
emerged
on
snow
hill
here
he
walked
even
faster
than
before
nor
did
he
linger
until
he
had
again
turned
into
a
court
when
as
if
conscious
that
he
was
now
in
his
proper
element
he
fell
into
his
usual
shuffling
pace
and
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
near
to
the
spot
on
which
snow
hill
and
holborn
hill
meet
opens
upon
the
right
hand
as
you
come
out
of
the
city
a
narrow
and
dismal
alley
leading
to
saffron
hill
in
its
filthy
shops
are
exposed
for
sale
huge
bunches
of
silk
handkerchiefs
of
all
sizes
and
patterns
for
here
reside
the
traders
who
purchase
them
from
hundreds
of
these
handkerchiefs
hang
dangling
from
pegs
outside
the
windows
or
flaunting
from
the
and
the
shelves
within
are
piled
with
them
confined
as
the
limits
of
field
lane
are
it
has
its
barber
its
its
and
its
warehouse
it
is
a
commercial
colony
of
itself
the
emporium
of
petty
larceny
visited
at
early
morning
and
of
dusk
by
silent
merchants
who
traffic
in
dark
and
who
go
as
strangely
as
they
come
here
the
clothesman

and
the
display
their
goods
as

the
petty
thief
here
stores
of
old
iron
and
bones
and
heaps
of
mildewy
fragments
of
and
linen
rust
and
rot
in
the
grimy
cellars
it
was
into
this
place
that
the
jew
turned
he
was
well
known
to
the
sallow
denizens
of
the
lane
for
such
of
them
as
were
on
the
to
buy
or
sell
nodded
familiarly
as
he
passed
along
he
replied
to
their
salutations
in
the
same
way
but
bestowed
no
closer
recognition
until
he
reached
the
further
end
of
the
alley
when
he
stopped
to
address
a
salesman
of
small
stature
who
had
squeezed
as
much
of
his
person
into
a
child
chair
as
the
chair
would
hold
and
was
smoking
a
pipe
at
his
warehouse
door
the
sight
of
you
fagin
would
cure
the
hoptalmy
said
this
respectable
trader
in
acknowledgment
of
the
jew
inquiry
after
his
health
neighbourhood
was
a
little
too
hot
lively
said
fagin
elevating
his
eyebrows
and
crossing
his
hands
upon
his
shoulders
i
heerd
that
complaint
of
it
once
or
twice
before
replied
the
trader
it
soon
cools
down
again
do
you
find
it
so
fagin
nodded
in
the
affirmative
pointing
in
the
direction
of
saffron
hill
he
inquired
whether
any
one
was
up
yonder
the
cripples
inquired
the
man
the
jew
nodded
me
see
pursued
the
merchant
reflecting
there
some
of
gone
in
that
i
knows
i
think
your
friend
there
is
not
i
suppose
inquired
the
jew
with
a
disappointed
countenance
as
the
lawyers
say
replied
the
little
man
shaking
his
head
and
looking
amazingly
sly
you
got
anything
in
my
line
said
the
jew
turning
away
you
going
up
to
the
cripples
fagin
cried
the
little
man
calling
after
him
i
do
mind
if
i
have
a
drop
there
with
you
but
as
the
jew
looking
back
waved
his
hand
to
intimate
that
he
preferred
being
alone
and
moreover
as
the
little
man
could
not
very
easily
disengage
himself
from
the
chair
the
sign
of
the
cripples
was
for
a
time
bereft
of
the
advantage
of
lively
presence
by
the
time
he
had
got
upon
his
legs
the
jew
had
disappeared
so
lively
after
ineffectually
standing
on
tiptoe
in
the
hope
of
catching
sight
of
him
again
forced
himself
into
the
little
chair
and
exchanging
a
shake
of
the
head
with
a
lady
in
the
opposite
shop
in
which
doubt
and
mistrust
were
plainly
mingled
resumed
his
pipe
with
a
grave
demeanour
the
three
cripples
or
rather
the
cripples
which
was
the
sign
by
which
the
establishment
was
familiarly
known
to
its
patrons
was
the
in
which
sikes
and
his
dog
have
already
figured
merely
making
a
sign
to
a
man
at
the
bar
fagin
walked
straight
upstairs
and
opening
the
door
of
a
room
and
softly
insinuating
himself
into
the
chamber
looked
anxiously
about
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
if
in
search
of
some
particular
person
the
room
was
illuminated
by
two
the
glare
of
which
was
prevented
by
the
barred
shutters
and
curtains
of
faded
red
from
being
visible
outside
the
ceiling
was
blackened
to
prevent
its
colour
from
being
injured
by
the
flaring
of
the
lamps
and
the
place
was
so
full
of
dense
tobacco
smoke
that
at
first
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
discern
anything
more
by
degrees
however
as
some
of
it
cleared
away
through
the
open
door
an
assemblage
of
heads
as
confused
as
the
noises
that
greeted
the
ear
might
be
made
out
and
as
the
eye
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
scene
the
spectator
gradually
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
numerous
company
male
and
female
crowded
round
a
long
table
at
the
upper
end
of
which
sat
a
chairman
with
a
hammer
of
office
in
his
hand
while
a
professional
gentleman
with
a
bluish
nose
and
his
face
tied
up
for
the
benefit
of
a
toothache
presided
at
a
jingling
piano
in
a
remote
corner
as
fagin
stepped
softly
in
the
professional
gentleman
running
over
the
keys
by
way
of
prelude
occasioned
a
general
cry
of
order
for
a
song
which
having
subsided
a
young
lady
proceeded
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
ballad
in
four
verses
between
each
of
which
the
accompanyist
played
the
melody
all
through
as
loud
as
he
could
when
this
was
over
the
chairman
gave
a
sentiment
after
which
the
professional
gentleman
on
the
chairman
right
and
left
volunteered
a
duet
and
sang
it
with
great
applause
it
was
curious
to
observe
some
faces
which
stood
out
prominently
from
among
the
group
there
was
the
chairman
himself
the
landlord
of
the
house
a
coarse
rough
heavy
built
fellow
who
while
the
songs
were
proceeding
rolled
his
eyes
hither
and
thither
and
seeming
to
give
himself
up
to
joviality
had
an
eye
for
everything
that
was
done
and
an
ear
for
everything
that
was
said
and
sharp
ones
too
near
him
were
the
singers
receiving
with
professional
indifference
the
compliments
of
the
company
and
applying
themselves
in
turn
to
a
dozen
proffered
glasses
of
spirits
and
water
tendered
by
their
more
boisterous
admirers
whose
countenances
expressive
of
almost
every
vice
in
almost
every
grade
irresistibly
attracted
the
attention
by
their
very
repulsiveness
cunning
ferocity
and
drunkeness
in
all
its
stages
were
there
in
their
strongest
aspect
and
women
some
with
the
last
lingering
tinge
of
their
early
freshness
almost
fading
as
you
looked
others
with
every
mark
and
stamp
of
their
sex
utterly
beaten
out
and
presenting
but
one
loathsome
blank
of
profligacy
and
crime
some
mere
girls
others
but
young
women
and
none
past
the
prime
of
life
formed
the
darkest
and
saddest
portion
of
this
dreary
picture
fagin
troubled
by
no
grave
emotions
looked
eagerly
from
face
to
face
while
these
proceedings
were
in
progress
but
apparently
without
meeting
that
of
which
he
was
in
search
succeeding
at
length
in
catching
the
eye
of
the
man
who
occupied
the
chair
he
beckoned
to
him
slightly
and
left
the
room
as
quietly
as
he
had
entered
it
can
i
do
for
you
mr
fagin
inquired
the
man
as
he
followed
him
out
to
the
landing
you
join
us
they
be
delighted
every
one
of
the
jew
shook
his
head
impatiently
and
said
in
a
whisper
here
replied
the
man
no
news
of
barney
inquired
fagin
replied
the
landlord
of
the
cripples
for
it
was
he
stir
till
it
all
safe
depend
on
it
they
on
the
scent
down
there
and
that
if
he
moved
he
blow
upon
the
thing
at
once
all
right
enough

else
i
should
have
heard
of
him
pound
it
that
barney
managing
properly
let
him
alone
for
that
be
here
asked
the
jew
laying
the
same
emphasis
on
the
pronoun
as
before
do
you
mean
inquired
the
landlord
hesitating
said
the
jew
replied
the
man
drawing
a
gold
watch
from
his
fob
expected
him
here
before
now
if
you
wait
ten
minutes
he
be
no
said
the
jew
hastily
as
though
however
desirous
he
might
be
to
see
the
person
in
question
he
was
nevertheless
relieved
by
his
absence
him
i
came
here
to
see
him
and
that
he
must
come
to
me
no
say
as
he
is
not
here
will
be
time
enough
said
the
man
more
a
word
now
said
the
jew
descending
the
stairs
say
said
the
other
looking
over
the
rails
and
speaking
in
a
hoarse
whisper
a
time
this
would
be
for
a
sell
i
got
phil
barker
here
so
drunk
that
a
boy
might
take
him
but
it
not
phil
barker
time
said
the
jew
looking
up
has
something
more
to
do
before
we
can
afford
to
part
with
him
so
go
back
to
the
company
my
dear
and
tell
them
to
lead
merry
lives
they
ha
ha
ha
the
landlord
reciprocated
the
old
man
laugh
and
returned
to
his
guests
the
jew
was
no
sooner
alone
than
his
countenance
resumed
its
former
expression
of
anxiety
and
thought
after
a
brief
reflection
he
called
a
and
bade
the
man
drive
towards
bethnal
green
he
dismissed
him
within
some
quarter
of
a
mile
of
residence
and
performed
the
short
remainder
of
the
distance
on
foot
muttered
the
jew
as
he
knocked
at
the
door
there
is
any
deep
play
here
i
shall
have
it
out
of
you
my
girl
cunning
as
you
are
she
was
in
her
room
the
woman
said
fagin
crept
softly
upstairs
and
entered
it
without
any
previous
ceremony
the
girl
was
alone
lying
with
her
head
upon
the
table
and
her
hair
straggling
over
it
has
been
drinking
thought
the
jew
cooly
perhaps
she
is
only
miserable
the
old
man
turned
to
close
the
door
as
he
made
this
reflection
the
noise
thus
occasioned
roused
the
girl
she
eyed
his
crafty
face
narrowly
as
she
inquired
to
his
recital
of
toby
crackit
story
when
it
was
concluded
she
sank
into
her
former
attitude
but
spoke
not
a
word
she
pushed
the
candle
impatiently
away
and
once
or
twice
as
she
feverishly
changed
her
position
shuffled
her
feet
upon
the
ground
but
this
was
all
during
the
silence
the
jew
looked
restlessly
about
the
room
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
there
were
no
appearances
of
sikes
having
covertly
returned
apparently
satisfied
with
his
inspection
he
coughed
twice
or
thrice
and
made
as
many
efforts
to
open
a
conversation
but
the
girl
heeded
him
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
made
of
stone
at
length
he
made
another
attempt
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
said
in
his
most
conciliatory
tone
where
should
you
think
bill
was
now
my
dear
the
girl
moaned
out
some
half
intelligible
reply
that
she
could
not
tell
and
seemed
from
the
smothered
noise
that
escaped
her
to
be
crying
the
boy
too
said
the
jew
straining
his
eyes
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
face
leetle
child
left
in
a
ditch
nance
only
think
child
said
the
girl
suddenly
looking
up
better
where
he
is
than
among
us
and
if
no
harm
comes
to
bill
from
it
i
hope
he
lies
dead
in
the
ditch
and
that
his
young
bones
may
rot
there
cried
the
jew
in
amazement
i
do
returned
the
girl
meeting
his
gaze
shall
be
glad
to
have
him
away
from
my
eyes
and
to
know
that
the
worst
is
over
i
ca
bear
to
have
him
about
me
the
sight
of
him
turns
me
against
myself
and
all
of
you
said
the
jew
scornfully
drunk
i
cried
the
girl
bitterly
no
fault
of
yours
if
i
am
not
you
never
have
me
anything
else
if
you
had
your
will
except
now
the
humour
does
suit
you
does
it
rejoined
the
jew
furiously
does
not
it
then
responded
the
girl
with
a
laugh
it
exclaimed
the
jew
exasperated
beyond
all
bounds
by
his
companion
unexpected
obstinacy
and
the
vexation
of
the
night
change
it
listen
to
me
you
drab
listen
to
me
who
with
six
words
can
strangle
sikes
as
surely
as
if
i
had
his
bull
throat
between
my
fingers
now
if
he
comes
back
and
leaves
the
boy
behind
him
if
he
gets
off
free
and
dead
or
alive
fails
to
restore
him
to
me
murder
him
yourself
if
you
would
have
him
escape
jack
ketch
and
do
it
the
moment
he
sets
foot
in
this
room
or
mind
me
it
will
be
too
late
is
all
this
cried
the
girl
involuntarily
is
it
pursued
fagin
mad
with
rage
the
boy
worth
hundreds
of
pounds
to
me
am
i
to
lose
what
chance
threw
me
in
the
way
of
getting
safely
through
the
whims
of
a
drunken
gang
that
i
could
whistle
away
the
lives
of
and
me
bound
too
to
a
born
devil
that
only
wants
the
will
and
has
the
power
to
to
panting
for
breath
the
old
man
stammered
for
a
word
and
in
that
instant
checked
the
torrent
of
his
wrath
and
changed
his
whole
demeanour
a
moment
before
his
clenched
hands
had
grasped
the
air
his
eyes
had
dilated
and
his
face
grown
livid
with
passion
but
now
he
shrunk
into
a
chair
and
cowering
together
trembled
with
the
apprehension
of
having
himself
disclosed
some
hidden
villainy
after
a
short
silence
he
ventured
to
look
round
at
his
companion
he
appeared
somewhat
reassured
on
beholding
her
in
the
same
listless
attitude
from
which
he
had
first
roused
her
dear
croaked
the
jew
in
his
usual
voice
you
mind
me
dear
worry
me
now
fagin
replied
the
girl
raising
her
head
languidly
bill
has
not
done
it
this
time
he
will
another
he
has
done
many
a
good
job
for
you
and
will
do
many
more
when
he
can
and
when
he
ca
he
wo
so
no
more
about
that
this
boy
my
dear
said
the
jew
rubbing
the
palms
of
his
hands
nervously
together
boy
must
take
his
chance
with
the
rest
interrupted
nancy
hastily
i
say
again
i
hope
he
is
dead
and
out
of
harm
way
and
out
of
yours
that
is
if
bill
comes
to
no
harm
and
if
toby
got
clear
off
bill
pretty
sure
to
be
safe
for
bill
worth
two
of
toby
any
time
about
what
i
was
saying
my
dear
observed
the
jew
keeping
his
glistening
eye
steadily
upon
her
must
say
it
all
over
again
if
it
anything
you
want
me
to
do
rejoined
nancy
if
it
is
you
had
better
wait
till
you
put
me
up
for
a
minute
but
now
i
stupid
again
fagin
put
several
other
questions
all
with
the
same
drift
of
ascertaining
whether
the
girl
had
profited
by
his
unguarded
hints
but
she
answered
them
so
readily
and
was
withal
so
utterly
unmoved
by
his
searching
looks
that
his
original
impression
of
her
being
more
than
a
trifle
in
liquor
was
confirmed
nancy
indeed
was
not
exempt
from
a
failing
which
was
very
common
among
the
jew
female
pupils
and
in
which
in
their
tenderer
years
they
were
rather
encouraged
than
checked
her
disordered
appearance
and
a
wholesale
perfume
of
geneva
which
pervaded
the
apartment
afforded
strong
confirmatory
evidence
of
the
justice
of
the
jew
supposition
and
when
after
indulging
in
the
temporary
display
of
violence
above
described
she
subsided
first
into
dullness
and
afterwards
into
a
compound
of
feelings
under
the
influence
of
which
she
shed
tears
one
minute
and
in
the
next
gave
utterance
to
various
exclamations
of
say
die
and
divers
calculations
as
to
what
might
be
the
amount
of
the
odds
so
long
as
a
lady
or
gentleman
was
happy
fagin
who
had
had
considerable
experience
of
such
matters
in
his
time
saw
with
great
satisfaction
that
she
was
very
far
gone
indeed
having
eased
his
mind
by
this
discovery
and
having
accomplished
his
twofold
object
of
imparting
to
the
girl
what
he
had
that
night
heard
and
of
ascertaining
with
his
own
eyes
that
sikes
had
not
returned
fagin
again
turned
his
face
homeward
leaving
his
young
friend
asleep
with
her
head
upon
the
table
it
was
within
an
hour
of
midnight
the
weather
being
dark
and
piercing
cold
he
had
no
great
temptation
to
loiter
the
sharp
wind
that
scoured
the
streets
seemed
to
have
cleared
them
of
passengers
as
of
dust
and
mud
for
few
people
were
abroad
and
they
were
to
all
appearance
hastening
fast
home
it
blew
from
the
right
quarter
for
the
jew
however
and
straight
before
it
he
went
trembling
and
shivering
as
every
fresh
gust
drove
him
rudely
on
his
way
he
had
reached
the
corner
of
his
own
street
and
was
already
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
the
when
a
dark
figure
emerged
from
a
projecting
entrance
which
lay
in
deep
shadow
and
crossing
the
road
glided
up
to
him
unperceived
whispered
a
voice
close
to
his
ear
said
the
jew
turning
quickly
round
that
interrupted
the
stranger
have
been
lingering
here
these
two
hours
where
the
devil
have
you
been
your
business
my
dear
replied
the
jew
glancing
uneasily
at
his
companion
and
slackening
his
pace
as
he
spoke
your
business
all
night
of
course
said
the
stranger
with
a
sneer
and
come
of
it
good
said
the
jew
bad
i
hope
said
the
stranger
stopping
short
and
turning
a
startled
look
on
his
companion
the
jew
shook
his
head
and
was
about
to
reply
when
the
stranger
interrupting
him
motioned
to
the
house
before
which
they
had
by
this
time
arrived
remarking
that
he
had
better
say
what
he
had
got
to
say
under
cover
for
his
blood
was
chilled
with
standing
about
so
long
and
the
wind
blew
through
him
fagin
looked
as
if
he
could
have
willingly
excused
himself
from
taking
home
a
visitor
at
that
unseasonable
hour
and
indeed
muttered
something
about
having
no
fire
but
his
companion
repeating
his
request
in
a
peremptory
manner
he
unlocked
the
door
and
requested
him
to
close
it
softly
while
he
got
a
light
as
dark
as
the
grave
said
the
man
groping
forward
a
few
steps
haste
the
door
whispered
fagin
from
the
end
of
the
passage
as
he
spoke
it
closed
with
a
loud
noise
was
my
doing
said
the
other
man
feeling
his
way
wind
blew
it
to
or
it
shut
of
its
own
accord
one
or
the
other
look
sharp
with
the
light
or
i
shall
knock
my
brains
out
against
something
in
this
confounded
hole
fagin
stealthily
descended
the
kitchen
stairs
after
a
short
absence
he
returned
with
a
lighted
candle
and
the
intelligence
that
toby
crackit
was
asleep
in
the
back
room
below
and
that
the
boys
were
in
the
front
one
beckoning
the
man
to
follow
him
he
led
the
way
upstairs
can
say
the
few
words
we
got
to
say
in
here
my
dear
said
the
jew
throwing
open
a
door
on
the
first
floor
as
there
are
holes
in
the
shutters
and
we
never
show
lights
to
our
neighbours
we
set
the
candle
on
the
stairs
there
with
those
words
the
jew
stooping
down
placed
the
candle
on
an
upper
flight
of
stairs
exactly
opposite
to
the
room
door
this
done
he
led
the
way
into
the
apartment
which
was
destitute
of
all
movables
save
a
broken
and
an
old
couch
or
sofa
without
covering
which
stood
behind
the
door
upon
this
piece
of
furniture
the
stranger
sat
himself
with
the
air
of
a
weary
man
and
the
jew
drawing
up
the
opposite
they
sat
face
to
face
it
was
not
quite
dark
the
door
was
partially
open
and
the
candle
outside
threw
a
feeble
reflection
on
the
opposite
wall
they
conversed
for
some
time
in
whispers
though
nothing
of
the
conversation
was
distinguishable
beyond
a
few
disjointed
words
here
and
there
a
listener
might
easily
have
perceived
that
fagin
appeared
to
be
defending
himself
against
some
remarks
of
the
stranger
and
that
the
latter
was
in
a
state
of
considerable
irritation
they
might
have
been
talking
thus
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
when
monks
by
which
name
the
jew
had
designated
the
strange
man
several
times
in
the
course
of
their
colloquy
said
raising
his
voice
a
little
tell
you
again
it
was
badly
planned
why
not
have
kept
him
here
among
the
rest
and
made
a
sneaking
snivelling
pickpocket
of
him
at
once
hear
him
exclaimed
the
jew
shrugging
his
shoulders
do
you
mean
to
say
you
could
have
done
it
if
you
had
chosen
demanded
monks
sternly
you
done
it
with
other
boys
scores
of
times
if
you
had
had
patience
for
a
twelvemonth
at
most
you
have
got
him
convicted
and
sent
safely
out
of
the
kingdom
perhaps
for
life
turn
would
that
have
served
my
dear
inquired
the
jew
humbly
replied
monks
not
mine
said
the
jew
submissively
might
have
become
of
use
to
me
when
there
are
two
parties
to
a
bargain
it
is
only
reasonable
that
the
interests
of
both
should
be
consulted
is
it
my
good
friend
then
demanded
monks
saw
it
was
not
easy
to
train
him
to
the
business
replied
the
jew
was
not
like
other
boys
in
the
same
circumstances
him
no
muttered
the
man
he
would
have
been
a
thief
long
ago
had
no
hold
upon
him
to
make
him
worse
pursued
the
jew
anxiously
watching
the
countenance
of
his
companion
hand
was
not
in
i
had
nothing
to
frighten
him
with
which
we
always
must
have
in
the
beginning
or
we
labour
in
vain
what
could
i
do
send
him
out
with
the
dodger
and
charley
we
had
enough
of
that
at
first
my
dear
i
trembled
for
us
all
was
not
my
doing
observed
monks
no
my
dear
renewed
the
jew
i
do
quarrel
with
it
now
because
if
it
had
never
happened
you
might
never
have
clapped
eyes
on
the
boy
to
notice
him
and
so
led
to
the
discovery
that
it
was
him
you
were
looking
for
well
i
got
him
back
for
you
by
means
of
the
girl
and
then
begins
to
favour
him
the
girl
said
monks
impatiently
we
ca
afford
to
do
that
just
now
my
dear
replied
the
jew
smiling
besides
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
in
our
way
or
one
of
these
days
i
might
be
glad
to
have
it
done
i
know
what
these
girls
are
monks
well
as
soon
as
the
boy
begins
to
harden
care
no
more
for
him
than
for
a
block
of
wood
you
want
him
made
a
thief
if
he
is
alive
i
can
make
him
one
from
this
time
and
if
if
said
the
jew
drawing
nearer
to
the
other
not
likely
mind
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
and
he
is
dead
no
fault
of
mine
if
he
is
interposed
the
other
man
with
a
look
of
terror
and
clasping
the
jew
arm
with
trembling
hands
that
fagin
i
had
no
hand
in
it
anything
but
his
death
i
told
you
from
the
first
i
wo
shed
blood
it
always
found
out
and
haunts
a
man
besides
if
they
shot
him
dead
i
was
not
the
cause
do
you
hear
me
fire
this
infernal
den
what
that
cried
the
jew
grasping
the
coward
round
the
body
with
both
arms
as
he
sprung
to
his
feet
replied
the
man
glaring
at
the
opposite
wall
shadow
i
saw
the
shadow
of
a
woman
in
a
cloak
and
bonnet
pass
along
the
wainscot
like
a
breath
the
jew
released
his
hold
and
they
rushed
tumultuously
from
the
room
the
candle
wasted
by
the
draught
was
standing
where
it
had
been
placed
it
showed
them
only
the
empty
staircase
and
their
own
white
faces
they
listened
intently
a
profound
silence
reigned
throughout
the
house
your
fancy
said
the
jew
taking
up
the
light
and
turning
to
his
companion
swear
i
saw
it
replied
monks
trembling
was
bending
forward
when
i
saw
it
first
and
when
i
spoke
it
darted
away
the
jew
glanced
contemptuously
at
the
pale
face
of
his
associate
and
telling
him
he
could
follow
if
he
pleased
ascended
the
stairs
they
looked
into
all
the
rooms
they
were
cold
bare
and
empty
they
descended
into
the
passage
and
thence
into
the
cellars
below
the
green
damp
hung
upon
the
low
walls
the
tracks
of
the
snail
and
slug
glistened
in
the
light
of
the
candle
but
all
was
still
as
death
do
you
think
now
said
the
jew
when
they
had
regained
the
passage
ourselves
there
not
a
creature
in
the
house
except
toby
and
the
boys
and
they
safe
enough
see
here
as
a
proof
of
the
fact
the
jew
drew
forth
two
keys
from
his
pocket
and
explained
that
when
he
first
went
downstairs
he
had
locked
them
in
to
prevent
any
intrusion
on
the
conference
this
accumulated
testimony
effectually
staggered
monks
his
protestations
had
gradually
become
less
and
less
vehement
as
they
proceeded
in
their
search
without
making
any
discovery
and
now
he
gave
vent
to
several
very
grim
laughs
and
confessed
it
could
only
have
been
his
excited
imagination
he
declined
any
renewal
of
the
conversation
however
for
that
night
suddenly
remembering
that
it
was
past
one
and
so
the
amiable
couple
parted
chapter
xxvii
atones
for
the
unpoliteness
of
a
former
chapter
which
deserted
a
lady
most
unceremoniously
as
it
would
be
by
no
means
seemly
in
a
humble
author
to
keep
so
mighty
a
personage
as
a
beadle
waiting
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
the
skirts
of
his
coat
gathered
up
under
his
arms
until
such
time
as
it
might
suit
his
pleasure
to
relieve
him
and
as
it
would
still
less
become
his
station
or
his
gallantry
to
involve
in
the
same
neglect
a
lady
on
whom
that
beadle
had
looked
with
an
eye
of
tenderness
and
affection
and
in
whose
ear
he
had
whispered
sweet
words
which
coming
from
such
a
quarter
might
well
thrill
the
bosom
of
maid
or
matron
of
whatsoever
degree
the
historian
whose
pen
traces
these
words
trusting
that
he
knows
his
place
and
that
he
entertains
a
becoming
reverence
for
those
upon
earth
to
whom
high
and
important
authority
is
delegated
hastens
to
pay
them
that
respect
which
their
position
demands
and
to
treat
them
with
all
that
duteous
ceremony
which
their
exalted
rank
and
by
consequence
great
virtues
imperatively
claim
at
his
hands
towards
this
end
indeed
he
had
purposed
to
introduce
in
this
place
a
dissertation
touching
the
divine
right
of
beadles
and
elucidative
of
the
position
that
a
beadle
can
do
no
wrong
which
could
not
fail
to
have
been
both
pleasurable
and
profitable
to
the
reader
but
which
he
is
unfortunately
compelled
by
want
of
time
and
space
to
postpone
to
some
more
convenient
and
fitting
opportunity
on
the
arrival
of
which
he
will
be
prepared
to
show
that
a
beadle
properly
constituted
that
is
to
say
a
parochial
beadle
attached
to
a
parochial
workhouse
and
attending
in
his
official
capacity
the
parochial
church
is
in
right
and
virtue
of
his
office
possessed
of
all
the
excellences
and
best
qualities
of
humanity
and
that
to
none
of
those
excellences
can
mere
companies
beadles
or
beadles
or
even
beadles
save
the
last
and
they
in
a
very
lowly
and
inferior
degree
lay
the
remotest
sustainable
claim
bumble
had
the
teaspoons
the
made
a
closer
inspection
of
the
and
ascertained
to
a
nicety
the
exact
condition
of
the
furniture
down
to
the
very
seats
of
the
chairs
and
had
repeated
each
process
full
half
a
dozen
times
before
he
began
to
think
that
it
was
time
for
corney
to
return
thinking
begets
thinking
as
there
were
no
sounds
of
approach
it
occured
to
bumble
that
it
would
be
an
innocent
and
virtuous
way
of
spending
the
time
if
he
were
further
to
allay
his
curiousity
by
a
cursory
glance
at
the
interior
of
corney
chest
of
drawers
having
listened
at
the
keyhole
to
assure
himself
that
nobody
was
approaching
the
chamber
bumble
beginning
at
the
bottom
proceeded
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
three
long
drawers
which
being
filled
with
various
garments
of
good
fashion
and
texture
carefully
preserved
between
two
layers
of
old
newspapers
speckled
with
dried
lavender
seemed
to
yield
him
exceeding
satisfaction
arriving
in
course
of
time
at
the
corner
drawer
in
which
was
the
key
and
beholding
therein
a
small
padlocked
box
which
being
shaken
gave
forth
a
pleasant
sound
as
of
the
chinking
of
coin
bumble
returned
with
a
stately
walk
to
the
fireplace
and
resuming
his
old
attitude
said
with
a
grave
and
determined
air
do
it
he
followed
up
this
remarkable
declaration
by
shaking
his
head
in
a
waggish
manner
for
ten
minutes
as
though
he
were
remonstrating
with
himself
for
being
such
a
pleasant
dog
and
then
he
took
a
view
of
his
legs
in
profile
with
much
seeming
pleasure
and
interest
he
was
still
placidly
engaged
in
this
latter
survey
when
corney
hurrying
into
the
room
threw
herself
in
a
breathless
state
on
a
chair
by
the
fireside
and
covering
her
eyes
with
one
hand
placed
the
other
over
her
heart
and
gasped
for
breath
corney
said
bumble
stooping
over
the
matron
is
this
has
anything
happened
pray
answer
me
on
on
bumble
in
his
alarm
could
not
immediately
think
of
the
word
so
he
said
bottles
mr
bumble
cried
the
lady
have
been
so
dreadfully
put
out
out
exclaimed
bumble
has
dared
to
i
know
said
bumble
checking
himself
with
native
majesty
is
them
wicious
paupers
dreadful
to
think
of
said
the
lady
shuddering
think
of
it
rejoined
bumble
ca
help
it
whimpered
the
lady
take
something
said
bumble
soothingly
little
of
the
wine
for
the
world
replied
corney
could
oh
the
top
shelf
in
the
corner
oh
uttering
these
words
the
good
lady
pointed
distractedly
to
the
cupboard
and
underwent
a
convulsion
from
internal
spasms
bumble
rushed
to
the
closet
and
snatching
a
pint
bottle
from
the
shelf
thus
incoherently
indicated
filled
a
with
its
contents
and
held
it
to
the
lady
lips
better
now
said
corney
falling
back
after
drinking
half
of
it
bumble
raised
his
eyes
piously
to
the
ceiling
in
thankfulness
and
bringing
them
down
again
to
the
brim
of
the
cup
lifted
it
to
his
nose
exclaimed
corney
in
a
faint
voice
smiling
gently
on
the
beadle
as
she
spoke
it
there
a
little
a
little
something
else
in
it
bumble
tasted
the
medicine
with
a
doubtful
look
smacked
his
lips
took
another
taste
and
put
the
cup
down
empty
very
comforting
said
corney
much
so
indeed
said
the
beadle
as
he
spoke
he
drew
a
chair
beside
the
matron
and
tenderly
inquired
what
had
happened
to
distress
her
replied
corney
am
a
foolish
excitable
weak
creetur
weak
retorted
bumble
drawing
his
chair
a
little
closer
you
a
weak
creetur
mrs
corney
are
all
weak
creeturs
said
corney
laying
down
a
general
principle
we
are
said
the
beadle
nothing
was
said
on
either
side
for
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
by
the
expiration
of
that
time
bumble
had
illustrated
the
position
by
removing
his
left
arm
from
the
back
of
corney
chair
where
it
had
previously
rested
to
corney
round
which
it
gradually
became
entwined
are
all
weak
creeturs
said
bumble
corney
sighed
sigh
corney
said
bumble
ca
help
it
said
corney
and
she
sighed
again
is
a
very
comfortable
room
said
bumble
looking
round
room
and
this
would
be
a
complete
thing
would
be
too
much
for
one
murmured
the
lady
not
for
two
rejoined
bumble
in
soft
accents
mrs
corney
corney
drooped
her
head
when
the
beadle
said
this
the
beadle
drooped
his
to
get
a
view
of
corney
face
corney
with
great
propriety
turned
her
head
away
and
released
her
hand
to
get
at
her
but
insensibly
replaced
it
in
that
of
bumble
board
allows
you
coals
do
they
mrs
corney
inquired
the
beadle
affectionately
pressing
her
hand
candles
replied
corney
slightly
returning
the
pressure
candles
and
free
said
bumble
corney
what
an
angel
you
are
the
lady
was
not
proof
against
this
burst
of
feeling
she
sank
into
bumble
arms
and
that
gentleman
in
his
agitation
imprinted
a
passionate
kiss
upon
her
chaste
nose
porochial
perfection
exclaimed
bumble
rapturously
know
that
slout
is
worse
my
fascinator
replied
corney
bashfully
ca
live
a
week
the
doctor
says
pursued
bumble
is
the
master
of
this
establishment
his
death
will
cause
a
wacancy
that
wacancy
must
be
filled
up
oh
corney
what
a
prospect
this
opens
what
a
opportunity
for
a
jining
of
hearts
and
housekeepings
corney
sobbed
little
word
said
bumble
bending
over
the
bashful
beauty
one
little
little
little
word
my
blessed
corney
ye
yes
sighed
out
the
matron
more
pursued
the
beadle
your
darling
feelings
for
only
one
more
when
is
it
to
come
off
corney
twice
essayed
to
speak
and
twice
failed
at
length
summoning
up
courage
she
threw
her
arms
around
bumble
neck
and
said
it
might
be
as
soon
as
ever
he
pleased
and
that
he
was
irresistible
duck
matters
being
thus
amicably
and
satisfactorily
arranged
the
contract
was
solemnly
ratified
in
another
teacupful
of
the
peppermint
mixture
which
was
rendered
the
more
necessary
by
the
flutter
and
agitation
of
the
lady
spirits
while
it
was
being
disposed
of
she
acquainted
bumble
with
the
old
woman
decease
good
said
that
gentleman
sipping
his
peppermint
call
at
sowerberry
as
i
go
home
and
tell
him
to
send
morning
was
it
that
as
frightened
you
love
was
anything
particular
dear
said
the
lady
evasively
must
have
been
something
love
urged
bumble
you
tell
your
own
now
rejoined
the
lady
of
these
days
after
we
married
dear
we
married
exclaimed
bumble
was
any
impudence
from
any
of
them
male
paupers
as
no
love
interposed
the
lady
hastily
i
thought
it
was
continued
bumble
i
thought
as
any
one
of
had
dared
to
lift
his
wulgar
eyes
to
that
lovely
countenance
would
have
dared
to
do
it
love
responded
the
lady
had
better
not
said
bumble
clenching
his
fist
me
see
any
man
porochial
or
as
would
presume
to
do
it
and
i
can
tell
him
that
he
would
do
it
a
second
time
unembellished
by
any
violence
of
gesticulation
this
might
have
seemed
no
very
high
compliment
to
the
lady
charms
but
as
bumble
accompanied
the
threat
with
many
warlike
gestures
she
was
much
touched
with
this
proof
of
his
devotion
and
protested
with
great
admiration
that
he
was
indeed
a
dove
the
dove
then
turned
up
his
and
put
on
his
cocked
hat
and
having
exchanged
a
long
and
affectionate
embrace
with
his
future
partner
once
again
braved
the
cold
wind
of
the
night
merely
pausing
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
male
paupers
ward
to
abuse
them
a
little
with
the
view
of
satisfying
himself
that
he
could
fill
the
office
of
with
needful
acerbity
assured
of
his
qualifications
bumble
left
the
building
with
a
light
heart
and
bright
visions
of
his
future
promotion
which
served
to
occupy
his
mind
until
he
reached
the
shop
of
the
undertaker
now
and
sowerberry
having
gone
out
to
tea
and
supper
and
noah
claypole
not
being
at
any
time
disposed
to
take
upon
himself
a
greater
amount
of
physical
exertion
than
is
necessary
to
a
convenient
performance
of
the
two
functions
of
eating
and
drinking
the
shop
was
not
closed
although
it
was
past
the
usual
hour
of
bumble
tapped
with
his
cane
on
the
counter
several
times
but
attracting
no
attention
and
beholding
a
light
shining
through
the
of
the
little
parlour
at
the
back
of
the
shop
he
made
bold
to
peep
in
and
see
what
was
going
forward
and
when
he
saw
what
was
going
forward
he
was
not
a
little
surprised
the
cloth
was
laid
for
supper
the
table
was
covered
with
bread
and
butter
plates
and
glasses
a
and
a
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
noah
claypole
lolled
negligently
in
an
with
his
legs
thrown
over
one
of
the
arms
an
open
in
one
hand
and
a
mass
of
buttered
bread
in
the
other
close
beside
him
stood
charlotte
opening
oysters
from
a
barrel
which
claypole
condescended
to
swallow
with
remarkable
avidity
a
more
than
ordinary
redness
in
the
region
of
the
young
gentleman
nose
and
a
kind
of
fixed
wink
in
his
right
eye
denoted
that
he
was
in
a
slight
degree
intoxicated
these
symptoms
were
confirmed
by
the
intense
relish
with
which
he
took
his
oysters
for
which
nothing
but
a
strong
appreciation
of
their
cooling
properties
in
cases
of
internal
fever
could
have
sufficiently
accounted
a
delicious
fat
one
noah
dear
said
charlotte
him
do
only
this
one
a
delicious
thing
is
a
oyster
remarked
claypole
after
he
had
swallowed
it
a
pity

a
number

uncomfortable

it
charlotte

bursting
into
the
room
that
again
sir
charlotte
uttered
a
scream
and
hid
her
face
in
her
apron
claypole
without
making
any
further
change
in
his
position
than
suffering
his
legs
to
reach
the
ground
gazed
at
the
beadle
in
drunken
terror
it
again

sir

cried
bumble
holding
up
his
hands
sin
and
wickedness
of
the
lower
orders
in
this
porochial
district
is
frightful
if
parliament
do
take
their
abominable
courses
under
consideration
this
country
ruined
and
the
character
of
the
peasantry
gone
for
ever
with
these
words
the
beadle
strode
with
a
lofty
and
gloomy
air
from
the
premises
and
now
that
we
have
accompanied
him
so
far
on
his
road
home
and
have
made
all
necessary
preparations
for
the
old
woman
funeral
let
us
set
on
foot
a
few
inquires
after
young
oliver
twist
and
ascertain
whether
he
be
still
lying
in
the
ditch
where
toby

left
him
chapter

looks
after

with
his
adventures
tear
your
throats
muttered
sikes
grinding
his
teeth
wish
i
was
among
some
of
you
you
howl
the
hoarser
for
it
as
sikes
growled
forth
this
imprecation
with
the
most
desperate
ferocity
that
his
desperate
nature
was
capable
of
he
rested
the
body
of
the
wounded
boy
across
his
bended
knee
and
turned
his
head
for
an
instant
to
look
back
at
his
pursuers
there
was
little
to
be
made
out
in
the
mist
and
darkness
but
the
loud
shouting
of
men
vibrated
through
the
air
and
the
barking
of
the
neighbouring
dogs
roused
by
the
sound
of
the
alarm
bell
resounded
in
every
direction
you
hound
cried
the
robber
shouting
after
toby
crackit
who
making
the
best
use
of
his
long
legs
was
already
ahead
the
repetition
of
the
word
brought
toby
to
a
dead
for
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
that
he
was
beyond
the
range
of
and
sikes
was
in
no
mood
to
be
played
with
a
hand
with
the
boy
cried
sikes
beckoning
furiously
to
his
confederate
back
toby
made
a
show
of
returning
but
ventured
in
a
low
voice
broken
for
want
of
breath
to
intimate
considerable
reluctance
as
he
came
slowly
along
cried
sikes
laying
the
boy
in
a
dry
ditch
at
his
feet
and
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
play
booty
with
me
at
this
moment
the
noise
grew
louder
sikes
again
looking
round
could
discern
that
the
men
who
had
given
chase
were
already
climbing
the
gate
of
the
field
in
which
he
stood
and
that
a
couple
of
dogs
were
some
paces
in
advance
of
them
all
up
bill
cried
toby
the
kid
and
show
your
heels
with
this
parting
advice
crackit
preferring
the
chance
of
being
shot
by
his
friend
to
the
certainty
of
being
taken
by
his
enemies
fairly
turned
tail
and
darted
off
at
full
speed
sikes
clenched
his
teeth
took
one
look
around
threw
over
the
prostrate
form
of
oliver
the
cape
in
which
he
had
been
hurriedly
muffled
ran
along
the
front
of
the
hedge
as
if
to
distract
the
attention
of
those
behind
from
the
spot
where
the
boy
lay
paused
for
a
second
before
another
hedge
which
met
it
at
right
angles
and
whirling
his
pistol
high
into
the
air
cleared
it
at
a
bound
and
was
gone
ho
there
cried
a
tremulous
voice
in
the
rear
neptune
come
here
come
here
the
dogs
who
in
common
with
their
masters
seemed
to
have
no
particular
relish
for
the
sport
in
which
they
were
engaged
readily
answered
to
the
command
three
men
who
had
by
this
time
advanced
some
distance
into
the
field
stopped
to
take
counsel
together
advice
or
leastways
i
should
say
my
is
said
the
fattest
man
of
the
party
we
go
home
again
am
agreeable
to
anything
which
is
agreeable
to
giles
said
a
shorter
man
who
was
by
no
means
of
a
slim
figure
and
who
was
very
pale
in
the
face
and
very
polite
as
frightened
men
frequently
are
should
wish
to
appear
gentlemen
said
the
third
who
had
called
the
dogs
back
giles
ought
to
know
replied
the
shorter
man
whatever
giles
says
it
is
our
place
to
contradict
him
no
no
i
know
my
sitiwation
thank
my
stars
i
know
my
sitiwation
to
tell
the
truth
the
little
man
seem
to
know
his
situation
and
to
know
perfectly
well
that
it
was
by
no
means
a
desirable
one
for
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
as
he
spoke
are
afraid
brittles
said
giles
a
said
brittles
are
said
giles
a
falsehood
giles
said
brittles
a
lie
brittles
said
giles
now
these
four
retorts
arose
from
giles
taunt
and
taunt
had
arisen
from
his
indignation
at
having
the
responsibility
of
going
home
again
imposed
upon
himself
under
cover
of
a
compliment
the
third
man
brought
the
dispute
to
a
close
most
philosophically
tell
you
what
it
is
gentlemen
said
he
all
afraid
for
yourself
sir
said
giles
who
was
the
palest
of
the
party
i
do
replied
the
man
natural
and
proper
to
be
afraid
under
such
circumstances
i
am
am
i
said
brittles
there
no
call
to
tell
a
man
he
is
so
bounceably
these
frank
admissions
softened
giles
who
at
once
owned
that
was
afraid
upon
which
they
all
three
faced
about
and
ran
back
again
with
the
completest
unanimity
until
giles
who
had
the
shortest
wind
of
the
party
as
was
encumbered
with
a
pitchfork
most
handsomely
insisted
on
stopping
to
make
an
apology
for
his
hastiness
of
speech
it
wonderful
said
giles
when
he
had
explained
a
man
will
do
when
his
blood
is
up
i
should
have
committed
murder
i
know
i
should
if
we
caught
one
of
them
rascals
as
the
other
two
were
impressed
with
a
similar
presentiment
and
as
their
blood
like
his
had
all
gone
down
again
some
speculation
ensued
upon
the
cause
of
this
sudden
change
in
their
temperament
know
what
it
was
said
giles
was
the
gate
should
wonder
if
it
was
exclaimed
brittles
catching
at
the
idea
may
depend
upon
it
said
giles
that
gate
stopped
the
flow
of
the
excitement
i
felt
all
mine
suddenly
going
away
as
i
was
climbing
over
it
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
the
other
two
had
been
visited
with
the
same
unpleasant
sensation
at
that
precise
moment
it
was
quite
obvious
therefore
that
it
was
the
gate
especially
as
there
was
no
doubt
regarding
the
time
at
which
the
change
had
taken
place
because
all
three
remembered
that
they
had
come
in
sight
of
the
robbers
at
the
instant
of
its
occurance
this
dialogue
was
held
between
the
two
men
who
had
surprised
the
burglars
and
a
travelling
tinker
who
had
been
sleeping
in
an
outhouse
and
who
had
been
roused
together
with
his
two
mongrel
curs
to
join
in
the
pursuit
giles
acted
in
the
double
capacity
of
butler
and
steward
to
the
old
lady
of
the
mansion
brittles
was
a
lad
of
who
having
entered
her
service
a
mere
child
was
treated
as
a
promising
young
boy
still
though
he
was
something
past
thirty
encouraging
each
other
with
such
converse
as
this
but
keeping
very
close
together
notwithstanding
and
looking
apprehensively
round
whenever
a
fresh
gust
rattled
through
the
boughs
the
three
men
hurried
back
to
a
tree
behind
which
they
had
left
their
lantern
lest
its
light
should
inform
the
thieves
in
what
direction
to
fire
catching
up
the
light
they
made
the
best
of
their
way
home
at
a
good
round
trot
and
long
after
their
dusky
forms
had
ceased
to
be
discernible
the
light
might
have
been
seen
twinkling
and
dancing
in
the
distance
like
some
exhalation
of
the
damp
and
gloomy
atmosphere
through
which
it
was
swiftly
borne
the
air
grew
colder
as
day
came
slowly
on
and
the
mist
rolled
along
the
ground
like
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
the
grass
was
wet
the
pathways
and
low
places
were
all
mire
and
water
the
damp
breath
of
an
unwholesome
wind
went
languidly
by
with
a
hollow
moaning
still
oliver
lay
motionless
and
insensible
on
the
spot
where
sikes
had
left
him
morning
drew
on
apace
the
air
become
more
sharp
and
piercing
as
its
first
dull
hue
the
death
of
night
rather
than
the
birth
of
day
glimmered
faintly
in
the
sky
the
objects
which
had
looked
dim
and
terrible
in
the
darkness
grew
more
and
more
defined
and
gradually
resolved
into
their
familiar
shapes
the
rain
came
down
thick
and
fast
and
pattered
noisily
among
the
leafless
bushes
but
oliver
felt
it
not
as
it
beat
against
him
for
he
still
lay
stretched
helpless
and
unconscious
on
his
bed
of
clay
at
length
a
low
cry
of
pain
broke
the
stillness
that
prevailed
and
uttering
it
the
boy
awoke
his
left
arm
rudely
bandaged
in
a
shawl
hung
heavy
and
useless
at
his
side
the
bandage
was
saturated
with
blood
he
was
so
weak
that
he
could
scarcely
raise
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
when
he
had
done
so
he
looked
feebly
round
for
help
and
groaned
with
pain
trembling
in
every
joint
from
cold
and
exhaustion
he
made
an
effort
to
stand
upright
but
shuddering
from
head
to
foot
fell
prostrate
on
the
ground
after
a
short
return
of
the
stupor
in
which
he
had
been
so
long
plunged
oliver
urged
by
a
creeping
sickness
at
his
heart
which
seemed
to
warn
him
that
if
he
lay
there
he
must
surely
die
got
upon
his
feet
and
essayed
to
walk
his
head
was
dizzy
and
he
staggered
to
and
fro
like
a
drunken
man
but
he
kept
up
nevertheless
and
with
his
head
drooping
languidly
on
his
breast
went
stumbling
onward
he
knew
not
whither
and
now
hosts
of
bewildering
and
confused
ideas
came
crowding
on
his
mind
he
seemed
to
be
still
walking
between
sikes
and
crackit
who
were
angrily
disputing
for
the
very
words
they
said
sounded
in
his
ears
and
when
he
caught
his
own
attention
as
it
were
by
making
some
violent
effort
to
save
himself
from
falling
he
found
that
he
was
talking
to
them
then
he
was
alone
with
sikes
plodding
on
as
on
the
previous
day
and
as
shadowy
people
passed
them
he
felt
the
grasp
upon
his
wrist
suddenly
he
started
back
at
the
report
of
firearms
there
rose
into
the
air
loud
cries
and
shouts
lights
gleamed
before
his
eyes
all
was
noise
and
tumult
as
some
unseen
hand
bore
him
hurriedly
away
through
all
these
rapid
visions
there
ran
an
undefined
uneasy
consciousness
of
pain
which
wearied
and
tormented
him
incessantly
thus
he
staggered
on
creeping
almost
mechanically
between
the
bars
of
gates
or
through
as
they
came
in
his
way
until
he
reached
a
road
here
the
rain
began
to
fall
so
heavily
that
it
roused
him
he
looked
about
and
saw
that
at
no
great
distance
there
was
a
house
which
perhaps
he
could
reach
pitying
his
condition
they
might
have
compassion
on
him
and
if
they
did
not
it
would
be
better
he
thought
to
die
near
human
beings
than
in
the
lonely
open
fields
he
summoned
up
all
his
strength
for
one
last
trial
and
bent
his
faltering
steps
towards
it
as
he
drew
nearer
to
this
house
a
feeling
come
over
him
that
he
had
seen
it
before
he
remembered
nothing
of
its
details
but
the
shape
and
aspect
of
the
building
seemed
familiar
to
him
that
garden
wall
on
the
grass
inside
he
had
fallen
on
his
knees
last
night
and
prayed
the
two
men
mercy
it
was
the
very
house
they
had
attempted
to
rob
oliver
felt
such
fear
come
over
him
when
he
recognised
the
place
that
for
the
instant
he
forgot
the
agony
of
his
wound
and
thought
only
of
flight
flight
he
could
scarcely
stand
and
if
he
were
in
full
possession
of
all
the
best
powers
of
his
slight
and
youthful
frame
whither
could
he
fly
he
pushed
against
the
it
was
unlocked
and
swung
open
on
its
hinges
he
tottered
across
the
lawn
climbed
the
steps
knocked
faintly
at
the
door
and
his
whole
strength
failing
him
sunk
down
against
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
little
portico
it
happened
that
about
this
time
giles
brittles
and
the
tinker
were
recruiting
themselves
after
the
fatigues
and
terrors
of
the
night
with
tea
and
sundries
in
the
kitchen
not
that
it
was
giles
habit
to
admit
to
too
great
familiarity
the
humbler
servants
towards
whom
it
was
rather
his
wont
to
deport
himself
with
a
lofty
affability
which
while
it
gratified
could
not
fail
to
remind
them
of
his
superior
position
in
society
but
death
fires
and
burglary
make
all
men
equals
so
giles
sat
with
his
legs
stretched
out
before
the
kitchen
fender
leaning
his
left
arm
on
the
table
while
with
his
right
he
illustrated
a
circumstantial
and
minute
account
of
the
robbery
to
which
his
bearers
but
especially
the
cook
and
housemaid
who
were
of
the
party
listened
with
breathless
interest
was
about
two
said
giles
i
would
swear
that
it
might
have
been
a
little
nearer
three
when
i
woke
up
and
turning
round
in
my
bed
as
it
might
be
so
here
giles
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
pulled
the
corner
of
the
over
him
to
imitate
i
fancied
i
heerd
a
noise
at
this
point
of
the
narrative
the
cook
turned
pale
and
asked
the
housemaid
to
shut
the
door
who
asked
brittles
who
asked
the
tinker
who
pretended
not
to
heerd
a
noise
continued
giles
says
at
first
this
is
illusion
and
was
composing
myself
off
to
sleep
when
i
heerd
the
noise
again
distinct
sort
of
a
noise
asked
the
cook
kind
of
a
busting
noise
replied
giles
looking
round
him
like
the
noise
of
powdering
a
iron
bar
on
a
suggested
brittles
was
when
heerd
it
sir
rejoined
giles
at
this
time
it
had
a
busting
sound
i
turned
down
the
clothes
continued
giles
rolling
back
the
up
in
bed
and
listened
the
cook
and
housemaid
simultaneously
ejaculated
and
drew
their
chairs
closer
together
heerd
it
now
quite
apparent
resumed
giles
somebody
i
says
is
forcing
of
a
door
or
window
what
to
be
done
i
call
up
that
poor
lad
brittles
and
save
him
from
being
murdered
in
his
bed
or
his
throat
i
says
may
be
cut
from
his
right
ear
to
his
left
without
his
ever
knowing
it
here
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
brittles
who
fixed
his
upon
the
speaker
and
stared
at
him
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
face
expressive
of
the
most
unmitigated
horror
tossed
off
the
clothes
said
giles
throwing
away
the
and
looking
very
hard
at
the
cook
and
housemaid
softly
out
of
bed
drew
on
a
pair
of
present
giles
murmured
the
of
sir
said
giles
turning
upon
him
and
laying
great
emphasis
on
the
word
the
loaded
pistol
that
always
goes
upstairs
with
the
and
walked
on
tiptoes
to
his
room
brittles
i
says
when
i
had
woke
him
do
be
frightened
you
did
observed
brittles
in
a
low
voice
we
dead
men
i
think
brittles
i
says
continued
giles
but
do
be
frightened
he
frightened
asked
the
cook
a
bit
of
it
replied
giles
was
as
firm
ah
pretty
near
as
firm
as
i
was
should
have
died
at
once
i
sure
if
it
had
been
me
observed
the
housemaid
a
woman
retorted
brittles
plucking
up
a
little
is
right
said
giles
nodding
his
head
approvingly
a
woman
nothing
else
was
to
be
expected
we
being
men
took
a
dark
lantern
that
was
standing
on
brittle
hob
and
groped
our
way
downstairs
in
the
pitch
dark
as
it
might
be
so
giles
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
taken
two
steps
with
his
eyes
shut
to
accompany
his
description
with
appropriate
action
when
he
started
violently
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
company
and
hurried
back
to
his
chair
the
cook
and
housemaid
screamed
was
a
knock
said
giles
assuming
perfect
serenity
the
door
somebody
nobody
moved
seems
a
strange
sort
of
a
thing
a
knock
coming
at
such
a
time
in
the
morning
said
giles
surveying
the
pale
faces
which
surrounded
him
and
looking
very
blank
himself
the
door
must
be
opened
do
you
hear
somebody
giles
as
he
spoke
looked
at
brittles
but
that
young
man
being
naturally
modest
probably
considered
himself
nobody
and
so
held
that
the
inquiry
could
not
have
any
application
to
him
at
all
events
he
tendered
no
reply
giles
directed
an
appealing
glance
at
the
tinker
but
he
had
suddenly
fallen
asleep
the
women
were
out
of
the
question
brittles
would
rather
open
the
door
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
said
giles
after
a
short
silence
am
ready
to
make
one
am
i
said
the
tinker
waking
up
as
suddenly
as
he
had
fallen
asleep
brittles
capitulated
on
these
terms
and
the
party
being
somewhat
by
the
discovery
made
on
throwing
open
the
shutters
that
it
was
now
broad
day
took
their
way
upstairs
with
the
dogs
in
front
the
two
women
who
were
afraid
to
stay
below
brought
up
the
rear
by
the
advice
of
giles
they
all
talked
very
loud
to
warn
any
person
outside
that
they
were
strong
in
numbers
and
by
a
of
policy
originating
in
the
brain
of
the
same
ingenious
gentleman
the
dogs
tails
were
well
pinched
in
the
hall
to
make
them
bark
savagely
these
precautions
having
been
taken
giles
held
on
fast
by
the
tinker
arm
to
prevent
his
running
away
as
he
pleasantly
said
and
gave
the
word
of
command
to
open
the
door
brittles
obeyed
the
group
peeping
timorously
over
each
other
shoulders
beheld
no
more
formidable
object
than
poor
little
oliver
twist
speechless
and
exhausted
who
raised
his
heavy
eyes
and
mutely
solicited
their
compassion
boy
exclaimed
giles
valiantly
pushing
the
tinker
into
the
background
the
matter
with
the
eh
why
brittles
look
here
do
you
know
brittles
who
had
got
behind
the
door
to
open
it
no
sooner
saw
oliver
than
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
giles
seizing
the
boy
by
one
leg
and
one
arm
fortunately
not
the
broken
limb
lugged
him
straight
into
the
hall
and
deposited
him
at
full
length
on
the
floor
thereof
he
is
bawled
giles
calling
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
up
the
staircase
one
of
the
thieves
here
a
thief
miss
wounded
miss
i
shot
him
miss
and
brittles
held
the
light
in
a
lantern
miss
cried
brittles
applying
one
hand
to
the
side
of
his
mouth
so
that
his
voice
might
travel
the
better
the
two
ran
upstairs
to
carry
the
intelligence
that
giles
had
captured
a
robber
and
the
tinker
busied
himself
in
endeavouring
to
restore
oliver
lest
he
should
die
before
he
could
be
hanged
in
the
midst
of
all
this
noise
and
commotion
there
was
heard
a
sweet
female
voice
which
quelled
it
in
an
instant
whispered
the
voice
from
the
here
miss
replied
giles
be
frightened
miss
i
ai
much
injured
he
did
make
a
very
desperate
resistance
miss
i
was
soon
too
many
for
him
replied
the
young
lady
frighten
my
aunt
as
much
as
the
thieves
did
is
the
poor
creature
much
hurt
desperate
miss
replied
giles
with
indescribable
complacency
looks
as
if
he
was
miss
bawled
brittles
in
the
same
manner
as
before
you
like
to
come
and
look
at
him
miss
in
case
he
should
pray
there
a
good
man
rejoined
the
lady
quietly
only
one
instant
while
i
speak
to
aunt
with
a
footstep
as
soft
and
gentle
as
the
voice
the
speaker
tripped
away
she
soon
returned
with
the
direction
that
the
wounded
person
was
to
be
carried
carefully
upstairs
to
giles
room
and
that
brittles
was
to
saddle
the
pony
and
betake
himself
instantly
to
chertsey
from
which
place
he
was
to
despatch
with
all
speed
a
constable
and
doctor
wo
you
take
one
look
at
him
first
miss
asked
giles
with
as
much
pride
as
if
oliver
were
some
bird
of
rare
plumage
that
he
had
skilfully
brought
down
one
little
peep
miss
now
for
the
world
replied
the
young
lady
fellow
oh
treat
him
kindly
giles
for
my
sake
the
old
servant
looked
up
at
the
speaker
as
she
turned
away
with
a
glance
as
proud
and
admiring
as
if
she
had
been
his
own
child
then
bending
over
oliver
he
helped
to
carry
him
upstairs
with
the
care
and
solicitude
of
a
woman
chapter
xxix
has
an
introductory
account
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
to
which
oliver
resorted
in
a
handsome
room
though
its
furniture
had
rather
the
air
of
comfort
than
of
modern
elegance
there
sat
two
ladies
at
a
giles
dressed
with
scrupulous
care
in
a
full
suit
of
black
was
in
attendance
upon
them
he
had
taken
his
station
some
between
the
and
the
and
with
his
body
drawn
up
to
its
full
height
his
head
thrown
back
and
inclined
the
merest
trifle
on
one
side
his
left
leg
advanced
and
his
right
hand
thrust
into
his
while
his
left
hung
down
by
his
side
grasping
a
waiter
looked
like
one
who
laboured
under
a
very
agreeable
sense
of
his
own
merits
and
importance
of
the
two
ladies
one
was
well
advanced
in
years
but
the
oaken
chair
in
which
she
sat
was
not
more
upright
than
she
dressed
with
the
utmost
nicety
and
precision
in
a
quaint
mixture
of
costume
with
some
slight
concessions
to
the
prevailing
taste
which
rather
served
to
point
the
old
style
pleasantly
than
to
impair
its
effect
she
sat
in
a
stately
manner
with
her
hands
folded
on
the
table
before
her
her
eyes
and
age
had
dimmed
but
little
of
their
brightness
were
attentively
upon
her
young
companion
the
younger
lady
was
in
the
lovely
bloom
and
of
womanhood
at
that
age
when
if
ever
angels
be
for
god
good
purposes
enthroned
in
mortal
forms
they
may
be
without
impiety
supposed
to
abide
in
such
as
hers
she
was
not
past
seventeen
cast
in
so
slight
and
exquisite
a
mould
so
mild
and
gentle
so
pure
and
beautiful
that
earth
seemed
not
her
element
nor
its
rough
creatures
her
fit
companions
the
very
intelligence
that
shone
in
her
deep
blue
eye
and
was
stamped
upon
her
noble
head
seemed
scarcely
of
her
age
or
of
the
world
and
yet
the
changing
expression
of
sweetness
and
good
humour
the
thousand
lights
that
played
about
the
face
and
left
no
shadow
there
above
all
the
smile
the
cheerful
happy
smile
were
made
for
home
and
fireside
peace
and
happiness
she
was
busily
engaged
in
the
little
offices
of
the
table
chancing
to
raise
her
eyes
as
the
elder
lady
was
regarding
her
she
playfully
put
back
her
hair
which
was
simply
braided
on
her
forehead
and
threw
into
her
beaming
look
such
an
expression
of
affection
and
artless
loveliness
that
blessed
spirits
might
have
smiled
to
look
upon
her
brittles
has
been
gone
upwards
of
an
hour
has
he
asked
the
old
lady
after
a
pause
hour
and
twelve
minutes
replied
giles
referring
to
a
silver
watch
which
he
drew
forth
by
a
black
ribbon
is
always
slow
remarked
the
old
lady
always
was
a
slow
boy
replied
the
attendant
and
seeing
by
the
bye
that
brittles
had
been
a
slow
boy
for
upwards
of
thirty
years
there
appeared
no
great
probability
of
his
ever
being
a
fast
one
gets
worse
instead
of
better
i
think
said
the
elder
lady
is
very
inexcusable
in
him
if
he
stops
to
play
with
any
other
boys
said
the
young
lady
smiling
giles
was
apparently
considering
the
propriety
of
indulging
in
a
respectful
smile
himself
when
a
gig
drove
up
to
the
out
of
which
there
jumped
a
fat
gentleman
who
ran
straight
up
to
the
door
and
who
getting
quickly
into
the
house
by
some
mysterious
process
burst
into
the
room
and
nearly
overturned
giles
and
the
together
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
exclaimed
the
fat
gentleman
dear
maylie
bless
my
soul
in
the
silence
of
the
night
too
i
heard
of
such
a
thing
with
these
expressions
of
condolence
the
fat
gentleman
shook
hands
with
both
ladies
and
drawing
up
a
chair
inquired
how
they
found
themselves
ought
to
be
dead
positively
dead
with
the
fright
said
the
fat
gentleman
did
you
send
bless
me
my
man
should
have
come
in
a
minute
and
so
would
i
and
my
assistant
would
have
been
delighted
or
anybody
i
sure
under
such
circumstances
dear
dear
so
unexpected
in
the
silence
of
the
night
too
the
doctor
seemed
expecially
troubled
by
the
fact
of
the
robbery
having
been
unexpected
and
attempted
in
the
as
if
it
were
the
established
custom
of
gentlemen
in
the
housebreaking
way
to
transact
business
at
noon
and
to
make
an
appointment
by
post
a
day
or
two
previous
you
miss
rose
said
the
doctor
turning
to
the
young
lady
very
much
so
indeed
said
rose
interrupting
him
there
is
a
poor
creature
upstairs
whom
aunt
wishes
you
to
see
to
be
sure
replied
the
doctor
there
is
that
was
your
handiwork
giles
i
understand
giles
who
had
been
feverishly
putting
the
to
rights
blushed
very
red
and
said
that
he
had
had
that
honour
eh
said
the
doctor
i
do
know
perhaps
it
as
honourable
to
hit
a
thief
in
a
back
kitchen
as
to
hit
your
man
at
twelve
paces
fancy
that
he
fired
in
the
air
and
you
fought
a
duel
giles
giles
who
thought
this
light
treatment
of
the
matter
an
unjust
attempt
at
diminishing
his
glory
answered
respectfully
that
it
was
not
for
the
like
of
him
to
judge
about
that
but
he
rather
thought
it
was
no
joke
to
the
opposite
party
that
true
said
the
doctor
is
he
show
me
the
way
i
look
in
again
as
i
come
down
maylie
that
the
little
window
that
he
got
in
at
eh
well
i
could
have
believed
it
talking
all
the
way
he
followed
giles
upstairs
and
while
he
is
going
upstairs
the
reader
may
be
informed
that
losberne
a
surgeon
in
the
neighbourhood
known
through
a
circuit
of
ten
miles
round
as
doctor
had
grown
fat
more
from
than
from
good
living
and
was
as
kind
and
hearty
and
withal
as
eccentric
an
old
bachelor
as
will
be
found
in
five
times
that
space
by
any
explorer
alive
the
doctor
was
absent
much
longer
than
either
he
or
the
ladies
had
anticipated
a
large
flat
box
was
fetched
out
of
the
gig
and
a
bedroom
bell
was
rung
very
often
and
the
servants
ran
up
and
down
stairs
perpetually
from
which
tokens
it
was
justly
concluded
that
something
important
was
going
on
above
at
length
he
returned
and
in
reply
to
an
anxious
inquiry
after
his
patient
looked
very
mysterious
and
closed
the
door
carefully
is
a
very
extraordinary
thing
maylie
said
the
doctor
standing
with
his
back
to
the
door
as
if
to
keep
it
shut
is
not
in
danger
i
hope
said
the
old
lady
that
would
be
an
extraordinary
thing
under
the
circumstances
replied
the
doctor
i
do
think
he
is
have
you
seen
the
thief
rejoined
the
old
lady
heard
anything
about
him
beg
your
pardon
interposed
giles
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
him
when
doctor
losberne
came
in
the
fact
was
that
giles
had
not
at
first
been
able
to
bring
his
mind
to
the
avowal
that
he
had
only
shot
a
boy
such
commendations
had
been
bestowed
upon
his
bravery
that
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
help
postponing
the
explanation
for
a
few
delicious
minutes
during
which
he
had
flourished
in
the
very
zenith
of
a
brief
reputation
for
undaunted
courage
wished
to
see
the
man
said
maylie
i
would
hear
of
it
rejoined
the
doctor
is
nothing
very
alarming
in
his
appearance
have
you
any
objection
to
see
him
in
my
presence
it
be
necessary
replied
the
old
lady
not
i
think
it
is
necessary
said
the
doctor
all
events
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
would
deeply
regret
not
having
done
so
if
you
postponed
it
he
is
perfectly
quiet
and
comfortable
now
allow
me
miss
rose
will
you
permit
me
not
the
slightest
fear
i
pledge
you
my
honour
chapter
xxx
relates
what
oliver
new
visitors
thought
of
him
with
many
loquacious
assurances
that
they
would
be
agreeably
surprised
in
the
aspect
of
the
criminal
the
doctor
drew
the
young
lady
arm
through
one
of
his
and
offering
his
disengaged
hand
to
maylie
led
them
with
much
ceremony
and
stateliness
upstairs
said
the
doctor
in
a
whisper
as
he
softly
turned
the
handle
of
a
us
hear
what
you
think
of
him
he
has
not
been
shaved
very
recently
but
he
do
look
at
all
ferocious
notwithstanding
stop
though
let
me
first
see
that
he
is
in
visiting
order
stepping
before
them
he
looked
into
the
room
motioning
them
to
advance
he
closed
the
door
when
they
had
entered
and
gently
drew
back
the
curtains
of
the
bed
upon
it
in
lieu
of
the
dogged
ruffian
they
had
expected
to
behold
there
lay
a
mere
child
worn
with
pain
and
exhaustion
and
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
his
wounded
arm
bound
and
splintered
up
was
crossed
upon
his
breast
his
head
reclined
upon
the
other
arm
which
was
half
hidden
by
his
long
hair
as
it
streamed
over
the
pillow
the
honest
gentleman
held
the
curtain
in
his
hand
and
looked
on
for
a
minute
or
so
in
silence
whilst
he
was
watching
the
patient
thus
the
younger
lady
glided
softly
past
and
seating
herself
in
a
chair
by
the
bedside
gathered
oliver
hair
from
his
face
as
she
stooped
over
him
her
tears
fell
upon
his
forehead
the
boy
stirred
and
smiled
in
his
sleep
as
though
these
marks
of
pity
and
compassion
had
awakened
some
pleasant
dream
of
a
love
and
affection
he
had
never
known
thus
a
strain
of
gentle
music
or
the
rippling
of
water
in
a
silent
place
or
the
odour
of
a
flower
or
the
mention
of
a
familiar
word
will
sometimes
call
up
sudden
dim
remembrances
of
scenes
that
never
were
in
this
life
which
vanish
like
a
breath
which
some
brief
memory
of
a
happier
existence
long
gone
by
would
seem
to
have
awakened
which
no
voluntary
exertion
of
the
mind
can
ever
recall
can
this
mean
exclaimed
the
elder
lady
poor
child
can
never
have
been
the
pupil
of
robbers
said
the
surgeon
replacing
the
curtain
up
her
abode
in
many
temples
and
who
can
say
that
a
fair
outside
shell
not
enshrine
her
at
so
early
an
age
urged
rose
dear
young
lady
rejoined
the
surgeon
mournfully
shaking
his
head
like
death
is
not
confined
to
the
old
and
withered
alone
the
youngest
and
fairest
are
too
often
its
chosen
victims
can
you
oh
can
you
really
believe
that
this
delicate
boy
has
been
the
voluntary
associate
of
the
worst
outcasts
of
society
said
rose
the
surgeon
shook
his
head
in
a
manner
which
intimated
that
he
feared
it
was
very
possible
and
observing
that
they
might
disturb
the
patient
led
the
way
into
an
adjoining
apartment
even
if
he
has
been
wicked
pursued
rose
how
young
he
is
think
that
he
may
never
have
known
a
mother
love
or
the
comfort
of
a
home
that
and
blows
or
the
want
of
bread
may
have
driven
him
to
herd
with
men
who
have
forced
him
to
guilt
aunt
dear
aunt
for
mercy
sake
think
of
this
before
you
let
them
drag
this
sick
child
to
a
prison
which
in
any
case
must
be
the
grave
of
all
his
chances
of
amendment
oh
as
you
love
me
and
know
that
i
have
never
felt
the
want
of
parents
in
your
goodness
and
affection
but
that
i
might
have
done
so
and
might
have
been
equally
helpless
and
unprotected
with
this
poor
child
have
pity
upon
him
before
it
is
too
late
dear
love
said
the
elder
lady
as
she
folded
the
weeping
girl
to
her
bosom
you
think
i
would
harm
a
hair
of
his
head
no
replied
rose
eagerly
surely
said
the
old
lady
days
are
drawing
to
their
close
and
may
mercy
be
shown
to
me
as
i
show
it
to
others
what
can
i
do
to
save
him
sir
me
think
said
the
doctor
me
think
losberne
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
took
several
turns
up
and
down
the
room
often
stopping
and
balancing
himself
on
his
toes
and
frowning
frightfully
after
various
exclamations
of
got
it
now
and
i
have
and
as
many
renewals
of
the
walking
and
frowning
he
at
length
made
a
dead
halt
and
spoke
as
follows
think
if
you
give
me
a
full
and
unlimited
commission
to
bully
giles
and
that
little
boy
brittles
i
can
manage
it
giles
is
a
faithful
fellow
and
an
old
servant
i
know
but
you
can
make
it
up
to
him
in
a
thousand
ways
and
reward
him
for
being
such
a
good
shot
besides
you
do
object
to
that
there
is
some
other
way
of
preserving
the
child
replied
maylie
is
no
other
said
the
doctor
other
take
my
word
for
it
my
aunt
invests
you
with
full
power
said
rose
smiling
through
her
tears
pray
do
be
harder
upon
the
poor
fellows
than
is
indispensably
necessary
seem
to
think
retorted
the
doctor
everybody
is
disposed
to
be
except
yourself
miss
rose
i
only
hope
for
the
sake
of
the
rising
male
sex
generally
that
you
may
be
found
in
as
vulnerable
and
a
mood
by
the
first
eligible
young
fellow
who
appeals
to
your
compassion
and
i
wish
i
were
a
young
fellow
that
i
might
avail
myself
on
the
spot
of
such
a
favourable
opportunity
for
doing
so
as
the
present
are
as
great
a
boy
as
poor
brittles
himself
returned
rose
blushing
said
the
doctor
laughing
heartily
is
no
very
difficult
matter
but
to
return
to
this
boy
the
great
point
of
our
agreement
is
yet
to
come
he
will
wake
in
an
hour
or
so
i
dare
say
and
although
i
have
told
that
downstairs
that
he
mus
be
moved
or
spoken
to
on
peril
of
his
life
i
think
we
may
converse
with
him
without
danger
now
i
make
this
stipulation
that
i
shall
examine
him
in
your
presence
and
that
if
from
what
he
says
we
judge
and
i
can
show
to
the
satisfaction
of
your
cool
reason
that
he
is
a
real
and
thorough
bad
one
which
is
more
than
possible
he
shall
be
left
to
his
fate
without
any
farther
interference
on
my
part
at
all
events
no
aunt
entreated
rose
yes
aunt
said
the
doctor
is
a
bargain
can
not
be
hardened
in
vice
said
rose
is
impossible
good
retorted
the
doctor
so
much
the
more
reason
for
acceding
to
my
proposition
finally
the
treaty
was
entered
into
and
the
parties
thereunto
sat
down
to
wait
with
some
impatience
until
oliver
should
awake
the
patience
of
the
two
ladies
was
destined
to
undergo
a
longer
trial
than
losberne
had
led
them
to
expect
for
hour
after
hour
passed
on
and
still
oliver
slumbered
heavily
it
was
evening
indeed
before
the
doctor
brought
them
the
intelligence
that
he
was
at
length
sufficiently
restored
to
be
spoken
to
the
boy
was
very
ill
he
said
and
weak
from
the
loss
of
blood
but
his
mind
was
so
troubled
with
anxiety
to
disclose
something
that
he
deemed
it
better
to
give
him
the
opportunity
than
to
insist
upon
his
remaining
quiet
until
next
morning
which
he
should
otherwise
have
done
the
conference
was
a
long
one
oliver
told
them
all
his
simple
history
and
was
often
compelled
to
stop
by
pain
and
want
of
strength
it
was
a
solemn
thing
to
hear
in
the
darkened
room
the
feeble
voice
of
the
sick
child
recounting
a
weary
catalogue
of
evils
and
calamities
which
hard
men
had
brought
upon
him
oh
if
when
we
oppress
and
grind
our
we
bestowed
but
one
thought
on
the
dark
evidences
of
human
error
which
like
dense
and
heavy
clouds
are
rising
slowly
it
is
true
but
not
less
surely
to
heaven
to
pour
their
on
our
heads
if
we
heard
but
one
instant
in
imagination
the
deep
testimony
of
dead
men
voices
which
no
power
can
stifle
and
no
pride
shut
out
where
would
be
the
injury
and
injustice
the
suffering
misery
cruelty
and
wrong
that
each
life
brings
with
it
oliver
pillow
was
smoothed
by
gentle
hands
that
night
and
loveliness
and
virtue
watched
him
as
he
slept
he
felt
calm
and
happy
and
could
have
died
without
a
murmur
the
momentous
interview
was
no
sooner
concluded
and
oliver
composed
to
rest
again
than
the
doctor
after
wiping
his
eyes
and
condemning
them
for
being
weak
all
at
once
betook
himself
downstairs
to
open
upon
giles
and
finding
nobody
about
the
parlours
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
perhaps
originate
the
proceedings
with
better
effect
in
the
kitchen
so
into
the
kitchen
he
went
there
were
assembled
in
that
lower
house
of
the
domestic
parliament
the
brittles
giles
the
tinker
who
had
received
a
special
invitation
to
regale
himself
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
consideration
of
his
services
and
the
constable
the
latter
gentleman
had
a
large
staff
a
large
head
large
features
and
large
and
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
taking
a
proportionate
allowance
of
ale
as
indeed
he
had
the
adventures
of
the
previous
night
were
still
under
discussion
for
giles
was
expatiating
upon
his
presence
of
mind
when
the
doctor
entered
brittles
with
a
mug
of
ale
in
his
hand
was
corroborating
everything
before
his
superior
said
it
still
said
the
doctor
waving
his
hand
you
sir
said
giles
wished
some
ale
to
be
given
out
sir
and
as
i
felt
no
ways
inclined
for
my
own
little
room
sir
and
was
disposed
for
company
i
am
taking
mine
among
here
brittles
headed
a
low
murmur
by
which
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
generally
were
understood
to
express
the
gratification
they
derived
from
giles
condescension
giles
looked
round
with
a
patronising
air
as
much
as
to
say
that
so
long
as
they
behaved
properly
he
would
never
desert
them
is
the
patient
sir
asked
giles
returned
the
doctor
am
afraid
you
have
got
yourself
into
a
scrape
there
mr
giles
hope
you
do
mean
to
say
sir
said
giles
trembling
he
going
to
die
if
i
thought
it
i
should
never
be
happy
again
i
would
cut
a
boy
off
no
not
even
brittles
here
not
for
all
the
plate
in
the
county
sir
not
the
point
said
the
doctor
mysteriously
giles
are
you
a
protestant
sir
i
hope
so
faltered
giles
who
had
turned
very
pale
what
are
boy
said
the
doctor
turning
sharply
upon
brittles
bless
me
sir
replied
brittles
starting
violently
the
same
as
giles
sir
tell
me
this
said
the
doctor
of
you
both
of
you
are
you
going
to
take
upon
yourselves
to
swear
that
that
boy
upstairs
is
the
boy
that
was
put
through
the
little
window
last
night
out
with
it
come
we
are
prepared
for
you
the
doctor
who
was
universally
considered
one
of
the
creatures
on
earth
made
this
demand
in
such
a
dreadful
tone
of
anger
that
giles
and
brittles
who
were
considerably
muddled
by
ale
and
excitement
stared
at
each
other
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
attention
to
the
reply
constable
will
you
said
the
doctor
shaking
his
forefinger
with
great
solemnity
of
manner
and
tapping
the
bridge
of
his
nose
with
it
to
bespeak
the
exercise
of
that
utmost
acuteness
may
come
of
this
before
long
the
constable
looked
as
wise
as
he
could
and
took
up
his
staff
of
office
which
had
been
reclining
indolently
in
the
a
simple
question
of
identity
you
will
observe
said
the
doctor
what
it
is
sir
replied
the
constable
coughing
with
great
violence
for
he
had
finished
his
ale
in
a
hurry
and
some
of
it
had
gone
the
wrong
way
the
house
broken
into
said
the
doctor
a
couple
of
men
catch
one
moment
glimpse
of
a
boy
in
the
midst
of
gunpowder
smoke
and
in
all
the
distraction
of
alarm
and
darkness
here
a
boy
comes
to
that
very
same
house
next
morning
and
because
he
happens
to
have
his
arm
tied
up
these
men
lay
violent
hands
upon
him
by
doing
which
they
place
his
life
in
great
danger
and
swear
he
is
the
thief
now
the
question
is
whether
these
men
are
justified
by
the
fact
if
not
in
what
situation
do
they
place
themselves
the
constable
nodded
profoundly
he
said
if
that
was
law
he
would
be
glad
to
know
what
was
ask
you
again
thundered
the
doctor
you
on
your
solemn
oaths
able
to
identify
that
boy
brittles
looked
doubtfully
at
giles
giles
looked
doubtfully
at
brittles
the
constable
put
his
hand
behind
his
ear
to
catch
the
reply
the
two
women
and
the
tinker
leaned
forward
to
listen
the
doctor
glanced
keenly
round
when
a
ring
was
heard
at
the
gate
and
at
the
same
moment
the
sound
of
wheels
the
runners
cried
brittles
to
all
appearance
much
relieved
what
exclaimed
the
doctor
aghast
in
his
turn
bow
street
officers
sir
replied
brittles
taking
up
a
candle
and
giles
sent
for
this
morning
cried
the
doctor
replied
brittles
sent
a
message
up
by
the
coachman
and
i
only
wonder
they
were
here
before
sir
did
did
you
then
confound
your
slow
coaches
down
here
all
said
the
doctor
walking
away
chapter
xxxi
involves
a
critical
position
that
inquired
brittles
opening
the
door
a
little
way
with
the
chain
up
and
peeping
out
shading
the
candle
with
his
hand
the
door
replied
a
man
outside
the
officers
from
bow
street
as
was
sent
to
much
comforted
by
this
assurance
brittles
opened
the
door
to
its
full
width
and
confronted
a
portly
man
in
a
who
walked
in
without
saying
anything
more
and
wiped
his
shoes
on
the
mat
as
coolly
as
if
he
lived
there
send
somebody
out
to
relieve
my
mate
will
you
young
man
said
the
officer
in
the
gig
the
prad
have
you
got
a
coach
here
that
you
could
put
it
up
in
for
five
or
ten
minutes
brittles
replying
in
the
affirmative
and
pointing
out
the
building
the
portly
man
stepped
back
to
the
and
helped
his
companion
to
put
up
the
gig
while
brittles
lighted
them
in
a
state
of
great
admiration
this
done
they
returned
to
the
house
and
being
shown
into
a
parlour
took
off
their
and
hats
and
showed
like
what
they
were
the
man
who
had
knocked
at
the
door
was
a
stout
personage
of
middle
height
aged
about
fifty
with
shiny
black
hair
cropped
pretty
close
a
round
face
and
sharp
eyes
the
other
was
a
bony
man
in
with
a
rather
countenance
and
a
nose
your
governor
that
blathers
and
duff
is
here
will
you
said
the
stouter
man
smoothing
down
his
hair
and
laying
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
the
table
master
can
i
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
in
private
if
you
please
this
was
addressed
to
losberne
who
now
made
his
appearance
that
gentleman
motioning
brittles
to
retire
brought
in
the
two
ladies
and
shut
the
door
is
the
lady
of
the
house
said
losberne
motioning
towards
maylie
blathers
made
a
bow
being
desired
to
sit
down
he
put
his
hat
on
the
floor
and
taking
a
chair
motioned
to
duff
to
do
the
same
the
latter
gentleman
who
did
not
appear
quite
so
much
accustomed
to
good
society
or
quite
so
much
at
his
ease
in
it
one
of
the
two
seated
himself
after
undergoing
several
muscular
affections
of
the
limbs
and
the
head
of
his
stick
into
his
mouth
with
some
embarrassment
with
regard
to
this
here
robbery
master
said
blathers
are
the
circumstances
losberne
who
appeared
desirous
of
gaining
time
recounted
them
at
great
length
and
with
much
circumlocution
blathers
and
duff
looked
very
knowing
meanwhile
and
occasionally
exchanged
a
nod
ca
say
for
certain
till
i
see
the
work
of
course
said
blathers
my
opinion
at
once
is
i
do
mind
committing
myself
to
that
extent
that
this
was
done
by
a
yokel
eh
duff
not
replied
duff
translating
the
word
yokel
for
the
benefit
of
the
ladies
i
apprehend
your
meaning
to
be
that
this
attempt
was
not
made
by
a
countryman
said
losberne
with
a
smile
it
master
replied
blathers
is
all
about
the
robbery
is
it
replied
the
doctor
what
is
this
about
this
here
boy
that
the
servants
are
on
said
blathers
at
all
replied
the
doctor
of
the
frightened
servants
chose
to
take
it
into
his
head
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
this
attempt
to
break
into
the
house
but
it
nonsense
sheer
absurdity
easy
disposed
of
if
it
is
remarked
duff
he
says
is
quite
correct
observed
blathers
nodding
his
head
in
a
confirmatory
way
and
playing
carelessly
with
the
handcuffs
as
if
they
were
a
pair
of
castanets
is
the
boy
what
account
does
he
give
of
himself
where
did
he
come
from
he
did
drop
out
of
the
clouds
did
he
master
course
not
replied
the
doctor
with
a
nervous
glance
at
the
two
ladies
know
his
whole
history
but
we
can
talk
about
that
presently
you
would
like
first
to
see
the
place
where
the
thieves
made
their
attempt
i
suppose
rejoined
blathers
had
better
inspect
the
premises
first
and
examine
the
servants
afterwards
that
the
usual
way
of
doing
business
lights
were
then
procured
and
blathers
and
duff
attended
by
the
native
constable
brittles
giles
and
everybody
else
in
short
went
into
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
looked
out
at
the
window
and
afterwards
went
round
by
way
of
the
lawn
and
looked
in
at
the
window
and
after
that
had
a
candle
handed
out
to
inspect
the
shutter
with
and
after
that
a
lantern
to
trace
the
footsteps
with
and
after
that
a
pitchfork
to
poke
the
bushes
with
this
done
amidst
the
breathless
interest
of
all
beholders
they
came
in
again
and
giles
and
brittles
were
put
through
a
melodramatic
representation
of
their
share
in
the
previous
night
adventures
which
they
performed
some
six
times
over
contradicting
each
other
in
not
more
than
one
important
respect
the
first
time
and
in
not
more
than
a
dozen
the
last
this
consummation
being
arrived
at
blathers
and
duff
cleared
the
room
and
held
a
long
council
together
compared
with
which
for
secrecy
and
solemnity
a
consultation
of
great
doctors
on
the
knottiest
point
in
medicine
would
be
mere
child
play
meanwhile
the
doctor
walked
up
and
down
the
next
room
in
a
very
uneasy
state
and
maylie
and
rose
looked
on
with
anxious
faces
my
word
he
said
making
a
halt
after
a
great
number
of
very
rapid
turns
hardly
know
what
to
do
said
rose
poor
child
story
faithfully
repeated
to
these
men
will
be
sufficient
to
exonerate
him
doubt
it
my
dear
young
lady
said
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
do
think
it
would
exonerate
him
either
with
them
or
with
legal
functionaries
of
a
higher
grade
what
is
he
after
all
they
would
say
a
runaway
judged
by
mere
worldly
considerations
and
probabilities
his
story
is
a
very
doubtful
one
believe
it
surely
interrupted
rose
believe
it
strange
as
it
is
and
perhaps
i
may
be
an
old
fool
for
doing
so
rejoined
the
doctor
i
do
think
it
is
exactly
the
tale
for
a
practical
nevertheless
not
demanded
rose
my
pretty
replied
the
doctor
viewed
with
their
eyes
there
are
many
ugly
points
about
it
he
can
only
prove
the
parts
that
look
ill
and
none
of
those
that
look
well
confound
the
fellows
they
have
the
why
and
the
wherefore
and
will
take
nothing
for
granted
on
his
own
showing
you
see
he
has
been
the
companion
of
thieves
for
some
time
past
he
has
been
carried
to
a
on
a
charge
of
picking
a
gentleman
pocket
he
has
been
taken
away
forcibly
from
that
gentleman
house
to
a
place
which
he
can
not
describe
or
point
out
and
of
the
situation
of
which
he
has
not
the
remotest
idea
he
is
brought
down
to
chertsey
by
men
who
seem
to
have
taken
a
violent
fancy
to
him
whether
he
will
or
no
and
is
put
through
a
window
to
rob
a
house
and
then
just
at
the
very
moment
when
he
is
going
to
alarm
the
inmates
and
so
do
the
very
thing
that
would
set
him
all
to
rights
there
rushes
into
the
way
a
blundering
dog
of
a
butler
and
shoots
him
as
if
on
purpose
to
prevent
his
doing
any
good
for
himself
do
you
see
all
this
see
it
of
course
replied
rose
smiling
at
the
impetuosity
still
i
do
not
see
anything
in
it
to
criminate
the
poor
child
replied
the
doctor
course
not
bless
the
bright
eyes
of
your
sex
they
never
see
whether
for
good
or
bad
more
than
one
side
of
any
question
and
that
is
always
the
one
which
first
presents
itself
to
them
having
given
vent
to
this
result
of
experience
the
doctor
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
even
greater
rapidity
than
before
more
i
think
of
it
said
the
doctor
more
i
see
that
it
will
occasion
endless
trouble
and
difficulty
if
we
put
these
men
in
possession
of
the
boy
real
story
i
am
certain
it
will
not
be
believed
and
even
if
they
can
do
nothing
to
him
in
the
end
still
the
dragging
it
forward
and
giving
publicity
to
all
the
doubts
that
will
be
cast
upon
it
must
interfere
materially
with
your
benevolent
plan
of
rescuing
him
from
misery
what
is
to
be
done
cried
rose
dear
why
did
they
send
for
these
people
indeed
exclaimed
maylie
would
not
have
had
them
here
for
the
world
i
know
is
said
losberne
at
last
sitting
down
with
a
kind
of
desperate
calmness
we
must
try
and
carry
it
off
with
a
bold
face
the
object
is
a
good
one
and
that
must
be
our
excuse
the
boy
has
strong
symptoms
of
fever
upon
him
and
is
in
no
condition
to
be
talked
to
any
more
that
one
comfort
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
and
if
bad
be
the
best
it
is
no
fault
of
ours
come
in
master
said
blathers
entering
the
room
followed
by
his
colleague
and
making
the
door
fast
before
he
said
any
more
war
a
thing
what
the
devil
a
thing
demanded
the
doctor
impatiently
call
it
a
robbery
ladies
said
blathers
turning
to
them
as
if
he
pitied
their
ignorance
but
had
a
contempt
for
the
doctor
the
servants
is
in
it
suspected
them
in
this
case
said
maylie
likely
not
replied
blathers
they
might
have
been
in
it
for
all
that
likely
on
that
wery
account
said
duff
find
it
was
a
town
hand
said
blathers
continuing
his
report
the
style
of
work
is
pretty
indeed
it
is
remarked
duff
in
an
undertone
was
two
of
in
it
continued
blathers
they
had
a
boy
with
that
plain
from
the
size
of
the
window
that
all
to
be
said
at
present
we
see
this
lad
that
you
got
upstairs
at
once
if
you
please
they
will
take
something
to
drink
first
mrs
maylie
said
the
doctor
his
face
brightening
as
if
some
new
thought
had
occurred
to
him
to
be
sure
exclaimed
rose
eagerly
shall
have
it
immediately
if
you
will
thank
you
miss
said
blathers
drawing
his
across
his
mouth
dry
work
this
sort
of
duty
anythink
that
handy
miss
do
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
on
our
accounts
shall
it
be
asked
the
doctor
following
the
young
lady
to
the
sideboard
little
drop
of
spirits
master
if
it
all
the
same
replied
blathers
a
cold
ride
from
london
and
i
always
find
that
spirits
comes
home
warmer
to
the
feelings
this
interesting
communication
was
addressed
to
maylie
who
received
it
very
graciously
while
it
was
being
conveyed
to
her
the
doctor
slipped
out
of
the
room
said
blathers
not
holding
his
by
the
stem
but
grasping
the
bottom
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
and
placing
it
in
front
of
his
chest
have
seen
a
good
many
pieces
of
business
like
this
in
my
time
ladies
crack
down
in
the
back
lane
at
edmonton
blathers
said
duff
assisting
his
colleague
memory
was
something
in
this
way
war
it
rejoined
blathers
was
done
by
conkey
chickweed
that
was
always
gave
that
to
him
replied
duff
was
the
family
pet
i
tell
you
conkey
had
any
more
to
do
with
it
than
i
had
out
retorted
blathers
know
better
do
you
mind
that
time
when
conkey
was
robbed
of
his
money
though
what
a
start
that
was
better
than
any
ever
see
was
that
inquired
rose
anxious
to
encourage
any
symptoms
of
in
the
unwelcome
visitors
was
a
robbery
miss
that
hardly
anybody
would
have
been
down
upon
said
blathers
here
conkey
chickweed
means
nosey
interposed
duff
course
the
lady
knows
that
do
she
demanded
blathers
interrupting
you
are
partner
this
here
conkey
chickweed
miss
kept
a
over
battlebridge
way
and
he
had
a
cellar
where
a
good
many
young
lords
went
to
see
and
and
that
and
a
wery
intellectual
manner
the
sports
was
conducted
in
for
i
seen
he
war
one
of
the
family
at
that
time
and
one
night
he
was
robbed
of
three
hundred
and
guineas
in
a
canvas
bag
that
was
stole
out
of
his
bedroom
in
the
dead
of
night
by
a
tall
man
with
a
black
patch
over
his
eye
who
had
concealed
himself
under
the
bed
and
after
committing
the
robbery
jumped
slap
out
of
window
which
was
only
a
story
high
he
was
wery
quick
about
it
but
conkey
was
quick
too
for
he
fired
a
blunderbuss
arter
him
and
roused
the
neighbourhood
they
set
up
a
directly
and
when
they
came
to
look
about
found
that
conkey
had
hit
the
robber
for
there
was
traces
of
blood
all
the
way
to
some
palings
a
good
distance
off
and
there
they
lost
however
he
had
made
off
with
the
blunt
and
consequently
the
name
of
chickweed
licensed
witler
appeared
in
the
gazette
among
the
other
bankrupts
and
all
manner
of
benefits
and
subscriptions
and
i
know
what
all
was
got
up
for
the
poor
man
who
was
in
a
wery
low
state
of
mind
about
his
loss
and
went
up
and
down
the
streets
for
three
or
four
days
a
pulling
his
hair
off
in
such
a
desperate
manner
that
many
people
was
afraid
he
might
be
going
to
make
away
with
himself
one
day
he
came
up
to
the
office
all
in
a
hurry
and
had
a
private
interview
with
the
magistrate
who
after
a
deal
of
talk
rings
the
bell
and
orders
jem
spyers
in
jem
was
a
active
officer
and
tells
him
to
go
and
assist
chickweed
in
apprehending
the
man
as
robbed
his
house
i
see
him
spyers
said
chickweed
pass
my
house
yesterday
morning
why
did
you
up
and
collar
him
says
spyers
i
was
so
struck
all
of
a
heap
that
you
might
have
fractured
my
skull
with
a
toothpick
says
the
poor
man
but
we
sure
to
have
him
for
between
ten
and
eleven
at
night
he
passed
again
spyers
no
sooner
heard
this
than
he
put
some
clean
linen
and
a
comb
in
his
pocket
in
case
he
should
have
to
stop
a
day
or
two
and
away
he
goes
and
sets
himself
down
at
one
of
the
windows
behind
the
little
red
curtain
with
his
hat
on
all
ready
to
bolt
out
at
a
moment
notice
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
here
late
at
night
when
all
of
a
sudden
chickweed
roars
out
here
he
is
stop
thief
murder
jem
spyers
dashes
out
and
there
he
sees
chickweed
down
the
street
full
cry
away
goes
spyers
on
goes
chickweed
round
turns
the
people
everybody
roars
out
thieves
and
chickweed
himself
keeps
on
shouting
all
the
time
like
mad
spyers
loses
sight
of
him
a
minute
as
he
turns
a
corner
shoots
round
sees
a
little
crowd
dives
in
which
is
the
man
d
me
says
chickweed
i
lost
him
again
it
was
a
remarkable
occurrence
but
he
war
to
be
seen
nowhere
so
they
went
back
to
the
next
morning
spyers
took
his
old
place
and
looked
out
from
behind
the
curtain
for
a
tall
man
with
a
black
patch
over
his
eye
till
his
own
two
eyes
ached
again
at
last
he
could
help
shutting
to
ease
a
minute
and
the
very
moment
he
did
so
he
hears
chickweed
out
here
he
is
off
he
starts
once
more
with
chickweed
down
the
street
ahead
of
him
and
after
twice
as
long
a
run
as
the
yesterday
one
the
man
lost
again
this
was
done
once
or
twice
more
till
the
neighbours
gave
out
that
chickweed
had
been
robbed
by
the
devil
who
was
playing
tricks
with
him
arterwards
and
the
other
half
that
poor
chickweed
had
gone
mad
with
grief
did
jem
spyers
say
inquired
the
doctor
who
had
returned
to
the
room
shortly
after
the
commencement
of
the
story
spyers
resumed
the
officer
a
long
time
said
nothing
at
all
and
listened
to
everything
without
seeming
to
which
showed
he
understood
his
business
but
one
morning
he
walked
into
the
bar
and
taking
out
his
snuffbox
says
chickweed
i
found
out
who
done
this
here
robbery
have
you
said
chickweed
oh
my
dear
spyers
only
let
me
have
wengeance
and
i
shall
die
contented
oh
my
dear
spyers
where
is
the
villain
come
said
spyers
offering
him
a
pinch
of
snuff
none
of
that
gammon
you
did
it
yourself
so
he
had
and
a
good
bit
of
money
he
had
made
by
it
too
and
nobody
would
never
have
found
it
out
if
he
had
been
so
precious
anxious
to
keep
up
appearances
said
blathers
putting
down
his
and
clinking
the
handcuffs
together
curious
indeed
observed
the
doctor
if
you
please
you
can
walk
upstairs
please
sir
returned
blathers
closely
following
losberne
the
two
officers
ascended
to
oliver
bedroom
giles
preceding
the
party
with
a
lighted
candle
oliver
had
been
dozing
but
looked
worse
and
was
more
feverish
than
he
had
appeared
yet
being
assisted
by
the
doctor
he
managed
to
sit
up
in
bed
for
a
minute
or
so
and
looked
at
the
strangers
without
at
all
understanding
what
was
going
forward
in
fact
without
seeming
to
recollect
where
he
was
or
what
had
been
passing
said
losberne
speaking
softly
but
with
great
vehemence
notwithstanding
is
the
lad
who
being
accidently
wounded
by
a
in
some
boyish
trespass
on
grounds
at
the
back
here
comes
to
the
house
for
assistance
this
morning
and
is
immediately
laid
hold
of
and
maltreated
by
that
ingenious
gentleman
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
who
has
placed
his
life
in
considerable
danger
as
i
can
professionally
certify
blathers
and
duff
looked
at
giles
as
he
was
thus
recommended
to
their
notice
the
bewildered
butler
gazed
from
them
towards
oliver
and
from
oliver
towards
losberne
with
a
most
ludicrous
mixture
of
fear
and
perplexity
do
mean
to
deny
that
i
suppose
said
the
doctor
laying
oliver
gently
down
again
was
all
done
for
the
for
the
best
sir
answered
giles
am
sure
i
thought
it
was
the
boy
or
i
would
have
meddled
with
him
i
am
not
of
an
inhuman
disposition
sir
it
was
what
boy
inquired
the
senior
officer
housebreaker
boy
sir
replied
giles
they
certainly
had
a
boy
do
you
think
so
now
inquired
blathers
what
now
replied
giles
looking
vacantly
at
his
questioner
it
the
same
boy
rejoined
blathers
impatiently
do
know
i
really
do
know
said
giles
with
a
rueful
countenance
could
swear
to
him
do
you
think
asked
blathers
do
know
what
to
think
replied
poor
giles
do
think
it
is
the
boy
indeed
i
almost
certain
that
it
is
you
know
it
be
this
man
been
sir
inquired
blathers
turning
to
the
doctor
a
precious
chap
you
are
said
duff
addressing
giles
with
supreme
contempt
losberne
had
been
feeling
the
patient
pulse
during
this
short
dialogue
but
he
now
rose
from
the
chair
by
the
bedside
and
remarked
that
if
the
officers
had
any
doubts
upon
the
subject
they
would
perhaps
like
to
step
into
the
next
room
and
have
brittles
before
them
acting
upon
this
suggestion
they
adjourned
to
a
neighbouring
apartment
where
brittles
being
called
in
involved
himself
and
his
respected
superior
in
such
a
wonderful
maze
of
fresh
contradictions
and
impossibilities
as
tended
to
throw
no
particular
light
on
anything
but
the
fact
of
his
own
strong
mystification
except
indeed
his
declarations
that
he
should
know
the
real
boy
if
he
were
put
before
him
that
instant
that
he
had
only
taken
oliver
to
be
he
because
giles
had
said
he
was
and
that
giles
had
five
minutes
previously
admitted
in
the
kitchen
that
he
began
to
be
very
much
afraid
he
had
been
a
little
too
hasty
among
other
ingenious
surmises
the
question
was
then
raised
whether
giles
had
really
hit
anybody
and
upon
examination
of
the
fellow
pistol
to
that
which
he
had
fired
it
turned
out
to
have
no
more
destructive
loading
than
gunpowder
and
brown
paper
a
discovery
which
made
a
considerable
impression
on
everybody
but
the
doctor
who
had
drawn
the
ball
about
ten
minutes
before
upon
no
one
however
did
it
make
a
greater
impression
than
on
giles
himself
who
after
labouring
for
some
hours
under
the
fear
of
having
mortally
wounded
a
eagerly
caught
at
this
new
idea
and
favoured
it
to
the
utmost
finally
the
officers
without
troubling
themselves
very
much
about
oliver
left
the
chertsey
constable
in
the
house
and
took
up
their
rest
for
that
night
in
the
town
promising
to
return
the
next
morning
with
the
next
morning
there
came
a
rumour
that
two
men
and
a
boy
were
in
the
cage
at
kingston
who
had
been
apprehended
over
night
under
suspicious
circumstances
and
to
kingston
blathers
and
duff
journeyed
accordingly
the
suspicious
circumstances
however
resolving
themselves
on
investigation
into
the
one
fact
that
they
had
been
discovered
sleeping
under
a
haystack
which
although
a
great
crime
is
only
punishable
by
imprisonment
and
is
in
the
merciful
eye
of
the
english
law
and
its
comprehensive
love
of
all
the
king
subjects
held
to
be
no
satisfactory
proof
in
the
absence
of
all
other
evidence
that
the
sleeper
or
sleepers
have
committed
burglary
accompanied
with
violence
and
have
therefore
rendered
themselves
liable
to
the
punishment
of
death
blathers
and
duff
came
back
again
as
wise
as
they
went
in
short
after
some
more
examination
and
a
great
deal
more
conversation
a
neighbouring
magistrate
was
readily
induced
to
take
the
joint
bail
of
maylie
and
losberne
for
oliver
appearance
if
he
should
ever
be
called
upon
and
blathers
and
duff
being
rewarded
with
a
couple
of
guineas
returned
to
town
with
divided
opinions
on
the
subject
of
their
expedition
the
latter
gentleman
on
a
mature
consideration
of
all
the
circumstances
inclining
to
the
belief
that
the
burglarious
attempt
had
originated
with
the
family
pet
and
the
former
being
equally
disposed
to
concede
the
full
merit
of
it
to
the
great
conkey
chickweed
meanwhile
oliver
gradually
throve
and
prospered
under
the
united
care
of
maylie
rose
and
the
losberne
if
fervent
prayers
gushing
from
hearts
overcharged
with
gratitude
be
heard
in
heaven
and
if
they
be
not
what
prayers
are
the
blessings
which
the
orphan
child
called
down
upon
them
sunk
into
their
souls
diffusing
peace
and
happiness
chapter
xxxii
of
the
happy
life
oliver
began
to
lead
with
his
kind
friends
oliver
ailings
were
neither
slight
nor
few
in
addition
to
the
pain
and
delay
attendant
on
a
broken
limb
his
exposure
to
the
wet
and
cold
had
brought
on
fever
and
ague
which
hung
about
him
for
many
weeks
and
reduced
him
sadly
but
at
length
he
began
by
slow
degrees
to
get
better
and
to
be
able
to
say
sometimes
in
a
few
tearful
words
how
deeply
he
felt
the
goodness
of
the
two
sweet
ladies
and
how
ardently
he
hoped
that
when
he
grew
strong
and
well
again
he
could
do
something
to
show
his
gratitude
only
something
which
would
let
them
see
the
love
and
duty
with
which
his
breast
was
full
something
however
slight
which
would
prove
to
them
that
their
gentle
kindness
had
not
been
cast
away
but
that
the
poor
boy
whom
their
charity
had
rescued
from
misery
or
death
was
eager
to
serve
them
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
fellow
said
rose
when
oliver
had
been
one
day
feebly
endeavouring
to
utter
the
words
of
thankfulness
that
rose
to
his
pale
lips
shall
have
many
opportunities
of
serving
us
if
you
will
we
are
going
into
the
country
and
my
aunt
intends
that
you
shall
accompany
us
the
quiet
place
the
pure
air
and
all
the
pleasure
and
beauties
of
spring
will
restore
you
in
a
few
days
we
will
employ
you
in
a
hundred
ways
when
you
can
bear
the
trouble
trouble
cried
oliver
dear
lady
if
i
could
but
work
for
you
if
i
could
only
give
you
pleasure
by
watering
your
flowers
or
watching
your
birds
or
running
up
and
down
the
whole
day
long
to
make
you
happy
what
would
i
give
to
do
it
shall
give
nothing
at
all
said
miss
maylie
smiling
as
i
told
you
before
we
shall
employ
you
in
a
hundred
ways
and
if
you
only
take
half
the
trouble
to
please
us
that
you
promise
now
you
will
make
me
very
happy
indeed
cried
oliver
kind
of
you
to
say
so
will
make
me
happier
than
i
can
tell
you
replied
the
young
lady
think
that
my
dear
good
aunt
should
have
been
the
means
of
rescuing
any
one
from
such
sad
misery
as
you
have
described
to
us
would
be
an
unspeakable
pleasure
to
me
but
to
know
that
the
object
of
her
goodness
and
compassion
was
sincerely
grateful
and
attached
in
consequence
would
delight
me
more
than
you
can
well
imagine
do
you
understand
me
she
inquired
watching
oliver
thoughtful
face
yes
yes
replied
oliver
eagerly
i
was
thinking
that
i
am
ungrateful
now
whom
inquired
the
young
lady
the
kind
gentleman
and
the
dear
old
nurse
who
took
so
much
care
of
me
before
rejoined
oliver
they
knew
how
happy
i
am
they
would
be
pleased
i
am
sure
am
sure
they
would
rejoined
oliver
benefactress
losberne
has
already
been
kind
enough
to
promise
that
when
you
are
well
enough
to
bear
the
journey
he
will
carry
you
to
see
them
he
cried
oliver
his
face
brightening
with
pleasure
do
know
what
i
shall
do
for
joy
when
i
see
their
kind
faces
once
again
in
a
short
time
oliver
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
undergo
the
fatigue
of
this
expedition
one
morning
he
and
losberne
set
out
accordingly
in
a
little
carriage
which
belonged
to
maylie
when
they
came
to
chertsey
bridge
oliver
turned
very
pale
and
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
the
matter
with
the
boy
cried
the
doctor
as
usual
all
in
a
bustle
you
see
anything
hear
anything
feel
anything
eh
sir
cried
oliver
pointing
out
of
the
carriage
window
house
well
what
of
it
stop
coachman
pull
up
here
cried
the
doctor
of
the
house
my
man
eh
thieves
the
house
they
took
me
to
whispered
oliver
devil
it
is
cried
the
doctor
there
let
me
out
but
before
the
coachman
could
dismount
from
his
box
he
had
tumbled
out
of
the
coach
by
some
means
or
other
and
running
down
to
the
deserted
tenement
began
kicking
at
the
door
like
a
madman
said
a
little
ugly
man
opening
the
door
so
suddenly
that
the
doctor
from
the
very
impetus
of
his
last
kick
nearly
fell
forward
into
the
passage
the
matter
here
exclaimed
the
other
collaring
him
without
a
reflection
good
deal
robbery
is
the
matter
be
murder
the
matter
too
replied
the
man
coolly
you
do
take
your
hands
off
do
you
hear
me
hear
you
said
the
doctor
giving
his
captive
a
hearty
shake
confound
the
fellow
what
his
rascally
name
sikes
it
where
sikes
you
thief
the
man
stared
as
if
in
excess
of
amazement
and
indignation
then
twisting
himself
dexterously
from
the
grasp
growled
forth
a
volley
of
horrid
oaths
and
retired
into
the
house
before
he
could
shut
the
door
however
the
doctor
had
passed
into
the
parlour
without
a
word
of
parley
he
looked
anxiously
round
not
an
article
of
furniture
not
a
vestige
of
anything
animate
or
inanimate
not
even
the
position
of
the
cupboards
answered
oliver
description
said
the
man
who
had
watched
him
keenly
do
you
mean
by
coming
into
my
house
in
this
violent
way
do
you
want
to
rob
me
or
to
murder
me
which
is
it
you
ever
know
a
man
come
out
to
do
either
in
a
chariot
and
pair
you
ridiculous
old
vampire
said
the
irritable
doctor
do
you
want
then
demanded
the
hunchback
you
take
yourself
off
before
i
do
you
a
mischief
curse
you
soon
as
i
think
proper
said
losberne
looking
into
the
other
parlour
which
like
the
first
bore
no
resemblance
whatever
to
oliver
account
of
it
shall
find
you
out
some
day
my
friend
you
sneered
the
cripple
you
ever
want
me
i
here
i
have
lived
here
mad
and
all
alone
for
years
to
be
scared
by
you
you
shall
pay
for
this
you
shall
pay
for
this
and
so
saying
the
little
demon
set
up
a
yell
and
danced
upon
the
ground
as
if
wild
with
rage
enough
this
muttered
the
doctor
to
himself
boy
must
have
made
a
mistake
here
put
that
in
your
pocket
and
shut
yourself
up
again
with
these
words
he
flung
the
hunchback
a
piece
of
money
and
returned
to
the
carriage
the
man
followed
to
the
chariot
door
uttering
the
wildest
imprecations
and
curses
all
the
way
but
as
losberne
turned
to
speak
to
the
driver
he
looked
into
the
carriage
and
eyed
oliver
for
an
instant
with
a
glance
so
sharp
and
fierce
and
at
the
same
time
so
furious
and
vindictive
that
waking
or
sleeping
he
could
not
forget
it
for
months
afterwards
he
continued
to
utter
the
most
fearful
imprecations
until
the
driver
had
resumed
his
seat
and
when
they
were
once
more
on
their
way
they
could
see
him
some
distance
behind
beating
his
feet
upon
the
ground
and
tearing
his
hair
in
transports
of
real
or
pretended
rage
am
an
ass
said
the
doctor
after
a
long
silence
you
know
that
before
oliver
sir
do
forget
it
another
time
ass
said
the
doctor
again
after
a
further
silence
of
some
minutes
if
it
had
been
the
right
place
and
the
right
fellows
had
been
there
what
could
i
have
done
and
if
i
had
had
assistance
i
see
no
good
that
i
should
have
done
except
leading
to
my
own
exposure
and
an
unavoidable
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
i
have
hushed
up
this
business
that
would
have
served
me
right
though
i
am
always
involving
myself
in
some
scrape
or
other
by
acting
on
impulse
it
might
have
done
me
good
now
the
fact
was
that
the
excellent
doctor
had
never
acted
upon
anything
but
impulse
all
through
his
life
and
it
was
no
bad
compliment
to
the
nature
of
the
impulses
which
governed
him
that
so
far
from
being
involved
in
any
peculiar
troubles
or
misfortunes
he
had
the
warmest
respect
and
esteem
of
all
who
knew
him
if
the
truth
must
be
told
he
was
a
little
out
of
temper
for
a
minute
or
two
at
being
disappointed
in
procuring
corroborative
evidence
of
oliver
story
on
the
very
first
occasion
on
which
he
had
a
chance
of
obtaining
any
he
soon
came
round
again
however
and
finding
that
oliver
replies
to
his
questions
were
still
as
straightforward
and
consistent
and
still
delivered
with
as
much
apparent
sincerity
and
truth
as
they
had
ever
been
he
made
up
his
mind
to
attach
full
credence
to
them
from
that
time
forth
as
oliver
knew
the
name
of
the
street
in
which
brownlow
resided
they
were
enabled
to
drive
straight
thither
when
the
coach
turned
into
it
his
heart
beat
so
violently
that
he
could
scarcely
draw
his
breath
my
boy
which
house
is
it
inquired
losberne
that
replied
oliver
pointing
eagerly
out
of
the
window
white
house
oh
make
haste
pray
make
haste
i
feel
as
if
i
should
die
it
makes
me
tremble
so
come
said
the
good
doctor
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
will
see
them
directly
and
they
will
be
overjoyed
to
find
you
safe
and
well
i
hope
so
cried
oliver
were
so
good
to
me
so
very
very
good
to
me
the
coach
rolled
on
it
stopped
no
that
was
the
wrong
house
the
next
door
it
went
on
a
few
paces
and
stopped
again
oliver
looked
up
at
the
windows
with
tears
of
happy
expectation
coursing
down
his
face
alas
the
white
house
was
empty
and
there
was
a
bill
in
the
window
let
at
the
next
door
cried
losberne
taking
oliver
arm
in
his
has
become
of
brownlow
who
used
to
live
in
the
adjoining
house
do
you
know
the
servant
did
not
know
but
would
go
and
inquire
she
presently
returned
and
said
that
brownlow
had
sold
off
his
goods
and
gone
to
the
west
indies
six
weeks
before
oliver
clasped
his
hands
and
sank
feebly
backward
his
housekeeper
gone
too
inquired
losberne
after
a
pause
sir
replied
the
servant
old
gentleman
the
housekeeper
and
a
gentleman
who
was
a
friend
of
brownlow
all
went
together
turn
towards
home
again
said
losberne
to
the
driver
do
stop
to
bait
the
horses
till
you
get
out
of
this
confounded
london
keeper
sir
said
oliver
know
the
way
there
see
him
pray
sir
do
see
him
poor
boy
this
is
disappointment
enough
for
one
day
said
the
doctor
enough
for
both
of
us
if
we
go
to
the
keeper
we
shall
certainly
find
that
he
is
dead
or
has
set
his
house
on
fire
or
run
away
no
home
again
straight
and
in
obedience
to
the
doctor
impulse
home
they
went
this
bitter
disappointment
caused
oliver
much
sorrow
and
grief
even
in
the
midst
of
his
happiness
for
he
had
pleased
himself
many
times
during
his
illness
with
thinking
of
all
that
brownlow
and
bedwin
would
say
to
him
and
what
delight
it
would
be
to
tell
them
how
many
long
days
and
nights
he
had
passed
in
reflecting
on
what
they
had
done
for
him
and
in
bewailing
his
cruel
separation
from
them
the
hope
of
eventually
clearing
himself
with
them
too
and
explaining
how
he
had
been
forced
away
had
buoyed
him
up
and
sustained
him
under
many
of
his
recent
trials
and
now
the
idea
that
they
should
have
gone
so
far
and
carried
with
them
the
belief
that
he
was
an
impostor
and
a
robber
a
belief
which
might
remain
uncontradicted
to
his
dying
day
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
the
circumstance
occasioned
no
alteration
however
in
the
behaviour
of
his
benefactors
after
another
fortnight
when
the
fine
warm
weather
had
fairly
begun
and
every
tree
and
flower
was
putting
forth
its
young
leaves
and
rich
blossoms
they
made
preparations
for
quitting
the
house
at
chertsey
for
some
months
sending
the
plate
which
had
so
excited
fagin
cupidity
to
the
banker
and
leaving
giles
and
another
servant
in
care
of
the
house
they
departed
to
a
cottage
at
some
distance
in
the
country
and
took
oliver
with
them
who
can
describe
the
pleasure
and
delight
the
peace
of
mind
and
soft
tranquillity
the
sickly
boy
felt
in
the
balmy
air
and
among
the
green
hills
and
rich
woods
of
an
inland
village
who
can
tell
how
scenes
of
peace
and
quietude
sink
into
the
minds
of
dwellers
in
close
and
noisy
places
and
carry
their
own
freshness
deep
into
their
jaded
hearts
men
who
have
lived
in
crowded
streets
through
lives
of
toil
and
who
have
never
wished
for
change
men
to
whom
custom
has
indeed
been
second
nature
and
who
have
come
almost
to
love
each
brick
and
stone
that
formed
the
narrow
boundaries
of
their
daily
walks
even
they
with
the
hand
of
death
upon
them
have
been
known
to
yearn
at
last
for
one
short
glimpse
of
nature
face
and
carried
far
from
the
scenes
of
their
old
pains
and
pleasures
have
seemed
to
pass
at
once
into
a
new
state
of
being
crawling
forth
from
day
to
day
to
some
green
sunny
spot
they
have
had
such
memories
wakened
up
within
them
by
the
sight
of
the
sky
and
hill
and
plain
and
glistening
water
that
a
foretaste
of
heaven
itself
has
soothed
their
quick
decline
and
they
have
sunk
into
their
tombs
as
peacefully
as
the
sun
whose
setting
they
watched
from
their
lonely
chamber
window
but
a
few
hours
before
faded
from
their
dim
and
feeble
sight
the
memories
which
peaceful
country
scenes
call
up
are
not
of
this
world
nor
of
its
thoughts
and
hopes
their
gentle
influence
may
teach
us
how
to
weave
fresh
garlands
for
the
graves
of
those
we
loved
may
purify
our
thoughts
and
bear
down
before
it
old
enmity
and
hatred
but
beneath
all
this
there
lingers
in
the
least
reflective
mind
a
vague
and
consciousness
of
having
held
such
feelings
long
before
in
some
remote
and
distant
time
which
calls
up
solemn
thoughts
of
distant
times
to
come
and
bends
down
pride
and
worldliness
beneath
it
it
was
a
lovely
spot
to
which
they
repaired
oliver
whose
days
had
been
spent
among
squalid
crowds
and
in
the
midst
of
noise
and
brawling
seemed
to
enter
on
a
new
existence
there
the
rose
and
honeysuckle
clung
to
the
cottage
walls
the
ivy
crept
round
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
the
perfumed
the
air
with
delicious
odours
hard
by
was
a
little
churchyard
not
crowded
with
tall
unsightly
gravestones
but
full
of
humble
mounds
covered
with
fresh
turf
and
moss
beneath
which
the
old
people
of
the
village
lay
at
rest
oliver
often
wandered
here
and
thinking
of
the
wretched
grave
in
which
his
mother
lay
would
sometimes
sit
him
down
and
sob
unseen
but
when
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
deep
sky
overhead
he
would
cease
to
think
of
her
as
lying
in
the
ground
and
would
weep
for
her
sadly
but
without
pain
it
was
a
happy
time
the
days
were
peaceful
and
serene
the
nights
brought
with
them
neither
fear
nor
care
no
languishing
in
a
wretched
prison
or
associating
with
wretched
men
nothing
but
pleasant
and
happy
thoughts
every
morning
he
went
to
a
old
gentleman
who
lived
near
the
little
church
who
taught
him
to
read
better
and
to
write
and
who
spoke
so
kindly
and
took
such
pains
that
oliver
could
never
try
enough
to
please
him
then
he
would
walk
with
maylie
and
rose
and
hear
them
talk
of
books
or
perhaps
sit
near
them
in
some
shady
place
and
listen
whilst
the
young
lady
read
which
he
could
have
done
until
it
grew
too
dark
to
see
the
letters
then
he
had
his
own
lesson
for
the
next
day
to
prepare
and
at
this
he
would
work
hard
in
a
little
room
which
looked
into
the
garden
till
evening
came
slowly
on
when
the
ladies
would
walk
out
again
and
he
with
them
listening
with
such
pleasure
to
all
they
said
and
so
happy
if
they
wanted
a
flower
that
he
could
climb
to
reach
or
had
forgotten
anything
he
could
run
to
fetch
that
he
could
never
be
quick
enough
about
it
when
it
became
quite
dark
and
they
returned
home
the
young
lady
would
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
play
some
pleasant
air
or
sing
in
a
low
and
gentle
voice
some
old
song
which
it
pleased
her
aunt
to
hear
there
would
be
no
candles
lighted
at
such
times
as
these
and
oliver
would
sit
by
one
of
the
windows
listening
to
the
sweet
music
in
a
perfect
rapture
and
when
sunday
came
how
differently
the
day
was
spent
from
any
way
in
which
he
had
ever
spent
it
yet
and
how
happily
too
like
all
the
other
days
in
that
most
happy
time
there
was
the
little
church
in
the
morning
with
the
green
leaves
fluttering
at
the
windows
the
birds
singing
without
and
the
air
stealing
in
at
the
low
porch
and
filling
the
homely
building
with
its
fragrance
the
poor
people
were
so
neat
and
clean
and
knelt
so
reverently
in
prayer
that
it
seemed
a
pleasure
not
a
tedious
duty
their
assembling
there
together
and
though
the
singing
might
be
rude
it
was
real
and
sounded
more
musical
to
oliver
ears
at
least
than
any
he
had
ever
heard
in
church
before
then
there
were
the
walks
as
usual
and
many
calls
at
the
clean
houses
of
the
labouring
men
and
at
night
oliver
read
a
chapter
or
two
from
the
bible
which
he
had
been
studying
all
the
week
and
in
the
performance
of
which
duty
he
felt
more
proud
and
pleased
than
if
he
had
been
the
clergyman
himself
in
the
morning
oliver
would
be
by
six
roaming
the
fields
and
plundering
the
hedges
far
and
wide
for
nosegays
of
wild
flowers
with
which
he
would
return
laden
home
and
which
it
took
great
care
and
consideration
to
arrange
to
the
best
advantage
for
the
embellishment
of
the
there
was
fresh
groundsel
too
for
miss
maylie
birds
with
which
oliver
who
had
been
studying
the
subject
under
the
able
tuition
of
the
village
clerk
would
decorate
the
cages
in
the
most
approved
taste
when
the
birds
were
made
all
spruce
and
smart
for
the
day
there
was
usually
some
little
commission
of
charity
to
execute
in
the
village
or
failing
that
there
was
rare
sometimes
on
the
green
or
failing
that
there
was
always
something
to
do
in
the
garden
or
about
the
plants
to
which
oliver
who
had
studied
this
science
also
under
the
same
master
who
was
a
gardener
by
trade
applied
himself
with
hearty
until
miss
rose
made
her
appearance
when
there
were
a
thousand
commendations
to
be
bestowed
on
all
he
had
done
so
three
months
glided
away
three
months
which
in
the
life
of
the
most
blessed
and
favoured
of
mortals
might
have
been
unmingled
happiness
and
which
in
oliver
were
true
felicity
with
the
purest
and
most
amiable
generosity
on
one
side
and
the
truest
warmest
gratitude
on
the
other
it
is
no
wonder
that
by
the
end
of
that
short
time
oliver
twist
had
become
completely
domesticated
with
the
old
lady
and
her
niece
and
that
the
fervent
attachment
of
his
young
and
sensitive
heart
was
repaid
by
their
pride
in
and
attachment
to
himself
chapter
xxxiii
wherein
the
happiness
of
oliver
and
his
friends
experiences
a
sudden
check
spring
flew
swiftly
by
and
summer
came
if
the
village
had
been
beautiful
at
first
it
was
now
in
the
full
glow
and
luxuriance
of
its
richness
the
great
trees
which
had
looked
shrunken
and
bare
in
the
earlier
months
had
now
burst
into
strong
life
and
health
and
stretching
forth
their
green
arms
over
the
thirsty
ground
converted
open
and
naked
spots
into
choice
nooks
where
was
a
deep
and
pleasant
shade
from
which
to
look
upon
the
wide
prospect
steeped
in
sunshine
which
lay
stretched
beyond
the
earth
had
donned
her
mantle
of
brightest
green
and
shed
her
richest
perfumes
abroad
it
was
the
prime
and
vigour
of
the
year
all
things
were
glad
and
flourishing
still
the
same
quiet
life
went
on
at
the
little
cottage
and
the
same
cheerful
serenity
prevailed
among
its
inmates
oliver
had
long
since
grown
stout
and
healthy
but
health
or
sickness
made
no
difference
in
his
warm
feelings
of
a
great
many
people
he
was
still
the
same
gentle
attached
affectionate
creature
that
he
had
been
when
pain
and
suffering
had
wasted
his
strength
and
when
he
was
dependent
for
every
slight
attention
and
comfort
on
those
who
tended
him
one
beautiful
night
when
they
had
taken
a
longer
walk
than
was
customary
with
them
for
the
day
had
been
unusually
warm
and
there
was
a
brilliant
moon
and
a
light
wind
had
sprung
up
which
was
unusually
refreshing
rose
had
been
in
high
spirits
too
and
they
had
walked
on
in
merry
conversation
until
they
had
far
exceeded
their
ordinary
bounds
maylie
being
fatigued
they
returned
more
slowly
home
the
young
lady
merely
throwing
off
her
simple
bonnet
sat
down
to
the
piano
as
usual
after
running
abstractedly
over
the
keys
for
a
few
minutes
she
fell
into
a
low
and
very
solemn
air
and
as
she
played
it
they
heard
a
sound
as
if
she
were
weeping
my
dear
said
the
elder
lady
rose
made
no
reply
but
played
a
little
quicker
as
though
the
words
had
roused
her
from
some
painful
thoughts
my
love
cried
maylie
rising
hastily
and
bending
over
her
is
this
in
tears
my
dear
child
what
distresses
you
aunt
nothing
replied
the
young
lady
do
know
what
it
is
i
ca
describe
it
but
i
feel
ill
my
love
interposed
maylie
no
oh
not
ill
replied
rose
shuddering
as
though
some
deadly
chillness
were
passing
over
her
while
she
spoke
shall
be
better
presently
close
the
window
pray
oliver
hastened
to
comply
with
her
request
the
young
lady
making
an
effort
to
recover
her
cheerfulness
strove
to
play
some
livelier
tune
but
her
fingers
dropped
powerless
over
the
keys
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
sank
upon
a
sofa
and
gave
vent
to
the
tears
which
she
was
now
unable
to
repress
child
said
the
elderly
lady
folding
her
arms
about
her
never
saw
you
so
before
would
not
alarm
you
if
i
could
avoid
it
rejoined
rose
indeed
i
have
tried
very
hard
and
can
not
help
this
i
fear
i
ill
aunt
she
was
indeed
for
when
candles
were
brought
they
saw
that
in
the
very
short
time
which
had
elapsed
since
their
return
home
the
hue
of
her
countenance
had
changed
to
a
marble
whiteness
its
expression
had
lost
nothing
of
its
beauty
but
it
was
changed
and
there
was
an
anxious
haggard
look
about
the
gentle
face
which
it
had
never
worn
before
another
minute
and
it
was
suffused
with
a
crimson
flush
and
a
heavy
wildness
came
over
the
soft
blue
eye
again
this
disappeared
like
the
shadow
thrown
by
a
passing
cloud
and
she
was
once
more
deadly
pale
oliver
who
watched
the
old
lady
anxiously
observed
that
she
was
alarmed
by
these
appearances
and
so
in
truth
was
he
but
seeing
that
she
affected
to
make
light
of
them
he
endeavoured
to
do
the
same
and
they
so
far
succeeded
that
when
rose
was
persuaded
by
her
aunt
to
retire
for
the
night
she
was
in
better
spirits
and
appeared
even
in
better
health
assuring
them
that
she
felt
certain
she
should
rise
in
the
morning
quite
well
hope
said
oliver
when
maylie
returned
nothing
is
the
matter
she
do
look
well
but
the
old
lady
motioned
to
him
not
to
speak
and
sitting
herself
down
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
remained
silent
for
some
time
at
length
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
hope
not
oliver
i
have
been
very
happy
with
her
for
some
years
too
happy
perhaps
it
may
be
time
that
i
should
meet
with
some
misfortune
but
i
hope
it
is
not
this
inquired
oliver
heavy
blow
said
the
old
lady
losing
the
dear
girl
who
has
so
long
been
my
comfort
and
happiness
god
forbid
exclaimed
oliver
hastily
to
that
my
child
said
the
old
lady
wringing
her
hands
there
is
no
danger
of
anything
so
dreadful
said
oliver
hours
ago
she
was
quite
well
is
very
ill
now
rejoined
maylies
will
be
worse
i
am
sure
my
dear
dear
rose
oh
what
shall
i
do
without
her
she
gave
way
to
such
great
grief
that
oliver
suppressing
his
own
emotion
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
and
to
beg
earnestly
that
for
the
sake
of
the
dear
young
lady
herself
she
would
be
more
calm
consider
said
oliver
as
the
tears
forced
themselves
into
his
eyes
despite
of
his
efforts
to
the
contrary
consider
how
young
and
good
she
is
and
what
pleasure
and
comfort
she
gives
to
all
about
her
i
am
sure
certain
quite
certain
that
for
your
sake
who
are
so
good
yourself
and
for
her
own
and
for
the
sake
of
all
she
makes
so
happy
she
will
not
die
heaven
will
never
let
her
die
so
young
said
maylie
laying
her
hand
on
oliver
head
think
like
a
child
poor
boy
but
you
teach
me
my
duty
notwithstanding
i
had
forgotten
it
for
a
moment
oliver
but
i
hope
i
may
be
pardoned
for
i
am
old
and
have
seen
enough
of
illness
and
death
to
know
the
agony
of
separation
from
the
objects
of
our
love
i
have
seen
enough
too
to
know
that
it
is
not
always
the
youngest
and
best
who
are
spared
to
those
that
love
them
but
this
should
give
us
comfort
in
our
sorrow
for
heaven
is
just
and
such
things
teach
us
impressively
that
there
is
a
brighter
world
than
this
and
that
the
passage
to
it
is
speedy
god
will
be
done
i
love
her
and
he
knows
how
well
oliver
was
surprised
to
see
that
as
maylie
said
these
words
she
checked
her
lamentations
as
though
by
one
effort
and
drawing
herself
up
as
she
spoke
became
composed
and
firm
he
was
still
more
astonished
to
find
that
this
firmness
lasted
and
that
under
all
the
care
and
watching
which
ensued
maylie
was
ever
ready
and
collected
performing
all
the
duties
which
had
devolved
upon
her
steadily
and
to
all
external
appearances
even
cheerfully
but
he
was
young
and
did
not
know
what
strong
minds
are
capable
of
under
trying
circumstances
how
should
he
when
their
possessors
so
seldom
know
themselves
an
anxious
night
ensued
when
morning
came
maylie
predictions
were
but
too
well
verified
rose
was
in
the
first
stage
of
a
high
and
dangerous
fever
must
be
active
oliver
and
not
give
way
to
useless
grief
said
maylie
laying
her
finger
on
her
lip
as
she
looked
steadily
into
his
face
letter
must
be
sent
with
all
possible
expedition
to
losberne
it
must
be
carried
to
the
which
is
not
more
than
four
miles
off
by
the
footpath
across
the
field
and
thence
dispatched
by
an
express
on
horseback
straight
to
chertsey
the
people
at
the
inn
will
undertake
to
do
this
and
i
can
trust
to
you
to
see
it
done
i
know
oliver
could
make
no
reply
but
looked
his
anxiety
to
be
gone
at
once
is
another
letter
said
maylie
pausing
to
reflect
whether
to
send
it
now
or
wait
until
i
see
how
rose
goes
on
i
scarcely
know
i
would
not
forward
it
unless
i
feared
the
worst
it
for
chertsey
too
inquired
oliver
impatient
to
execute
his
commission
and
holding
out
his
trembling
hand
for
the
letter
replied
the
old
lady
giving
it
to
him
mechanically
oliver
glanced
at
it
and
saw
that
it
was
directed
to
harry
maylie
esquire
at
some
great
lord
house
in
the
country
where
he
could
not
make
out
it
go
asked
oliver
looking
up
impatiently
think
not
replied
maylie
taking
it
back
will
wait
until
with
these
words
she
gave
oliver
her
purse
and
he
started
off
without
more
delay
at
the
greatest
speed
he
could
muster
swiftly
he
ran
across
the
fields
and
down
the
little
lanes
which
sometimes
divided
them
now
almost
hidden
by
the
high
corn
on
either
side
and
now
emerging
on
an
open
field
where
the
mowers
and
haymakers
were
busy
at
their
work
nor
did
he
stop
once
save
now
and
then
for
a
few
seconds
to
recover
breath
until
he
came
in
a
great
heat
and
covered
with
dust
on
the
little
of
the
here
he
paused
and
looked
about
for
the
inn
there
were
a
white
bank
and
a
red
brewery
and
a
yellow
and
in
one
corner
there
was
a
large
house
with
all
the
wood
about
it
painted
green
before
which
was
the
sign
of
george
to
this
he
hastened
as
soon
as
it
caught
his
eye
he
spoke
to
a
postboy
who
was
dozing
under
the
gateway
and
who
after
hearing
what
he
wanted
referred
him
to
the
ostler
who
after
hearing
all
he
had
to
say
again
referred
him
to
the
landlord
who
was
a
tall
gentleman
in
a
blue
neckcloth
a
white
hat
drab
breeches
and
boots
with
tops
to
match
leaning
against
a
pump
by
the
picking
his
teeth
with
a
silver
toothpick
this
gentleman
walked
with
much
deliberation
into
the
bar
to
make
out
the
bill
which
took
a
long
time
making
out
and
after
it
was
ready
and
paid
a
horse
had
to
be
saddled
and
a
man
to
be
dressed
which
took
up
ten
good
minutes
more
meanwhile
oliver
was
in
such
a
desperate
state
of
impatience
and
anxiety
that
he
felt
as
if
he
could
have
jumped
upon
the
horse
himself
and
galloped
away
full
tear
to
the
next
stage
at
length
all
was
ready
and
the
little
parcel
having
been
handed
up
with
many
injunctions
and
entreaties
for
its
speedy
delivery
the
man
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rattling
over
the
uneven
paving
of
the
was
out
of
the
town
and
galloping
along
the
in
a
couple
of
minutes
as
it
was
something
to
feel
certain
that
assistance
was
sent
for
and
that
no
time
had
been
lost
oliver
hurried
up
the
with
a
somewhat
lighter
heart
he
was
turning
out
of
the
gateway
when
he
accidently
stumbled
against
a
tall
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
who
was
at
that
moment
coming
out
of
the
inn
door
cried
the
man
fixing
his
eyes
on
oliver
and
suddenly
recoiling
the
devil
this
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
oliver
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
home
and
did
see
you
were
coming
muttered
the
man
to
himself
glaring
at
the
boy
with
his
large
dark
eyes
would
have
thought
it
grind
him
to
ashes
he
start
up
from
a
stone
coffin
to
come
in
my
way
am
sorry
stammered
oliver
confused
by
the
strange
man
wild
look
hope
i
have
not
hurt
you
you
murmured
the
man
in
a
horrible
passion
between
his
clenched
teeth
i
had
only
had
the
courage
to
say
the
word
i
might
have
been
free
of
you
in
a
night
curses
on
your
head
and
black
death
on
your
heart
you
imp
what
are
you
doing
here
the
man
shook
his
fist
as
he
uttered
these
words
incoherently
he
advanced
towards
oliver
as
if
with
the
intention
of
aiming
a
blow
at
him
but
fell
violently
on
the
ground
writhing
and
foaming
in
a
fit
oliver
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
struggles
of
the
madman
for
such
he
supposed
him
to
be
and
then
darted
into
the
house
for
help
having
seen
him
safely
carried
into
the
hotel
he
turned
his
face
homewards
running
as
fast
as
he
could
to
make
up
for
lost
time
and
recalling
with
a
great
deal
of
astonishment
and
some
fear
the
extraordinary
behaviour
of
the
person
from
whom
he
had
just
parted
the
circumstance
did
not
dwell
in
his
recollection
long
however
for
when
he
reached
the
cottage
there
was
enough
to
occupy
his
mind
and
to
drive
all
considerations
of
self
completely
from
his
memory
rose
maylie
had
rapidly
grown
worse
before
she
was
delirious
a
medical
practitioner
who
resided
on
the
spot
was
in
constant
attendance
upon
her
and
after
first
seeing
the
patient
he
had
taken
maylie
aside
and
pronounced
her
disorder
to
be
one
of
a
most
alarming
nature
fact
he
said
would
be
little
short
of
a
miracle
if
she
recovered
how
often
did
oliver
start
from
his
bed
that
night
and
stealing
out
with
noiseless
footstep
to
the
staircase
listen
for
the
slightest
sound
from
the
sick
chamber
how
often
did
a
tremble
shake
his
frame
and
cold
drops
of
terror
start
upon
his
brow
when
a
sudden
trampling
of
feet
caused
him
to
fear
that
something
too
dreadful
to
think
of
had
even
then
occurred
and
what
had
been
the
fervency
of
all
the
prayers
he
had
ever
muttered
compared
with
those
he
poured
forth
now
in
the
agony
and
passion
of
his
supplication
for
the
life
and
health
of
the
gentle
creature
who
was
tottering
on
the
deep
grave
verge
oh
the
suspense
the
fearful
acute
suspense
of
standing
idly
by
while
the
life
of
one
we
dearly
love
is
trembling
in
the
balance
oh
the
racking
thoughts
that
crowd
upon
the
mind
and
make
the
heart
beat
violently
and
the
breath
come
thick
by
the
force
of
the
images
they
conjure
up
before
it
the
desperate
anxiety
be
doing
to
relieve
the
pain
or
lessen
the
danger
which
we
have
no
power
to
alleviate
the
sinking
of
soul
and
spirit
which
the
sad
remembrance
of
our
helplessness
produces
what
tortures
can
equal
these
what
reflections
or
endeavours
can
in
the
full
tide
and
fever
of
the
time
allay
them
morning
came
and
the
little
cottage
was
lonely
and
still
people
spoke
in
whispers
anxious
faces
appeared
at
the
gate
from
time
to
time
women
and
children
went
away
in
tears
all
the
livelong
day
and
for
hours
after
it
had
grown
dark
oliver
paced
softly
up
and
down
the
garden
raising
his
eyes
every
instant
to
the
sick
chamber
and
shuddering
to
see
the
darkened
window
looking
as
if
death
lay
stretched
inside
late
that
night
losberne
arrived
is
hard
said
the
good
doctor
turning
away
as
he
spoke
young
so
much
beloved
but
there
is
very
little
hope
another
morning
the
sun
shone
brightly
as
brightly
as
if
it
looked
upon
no
misery
or
care
and
with
every
leaf
and
flower
in
full
bloom
about
her
with
life
and
health
and
sounds
and
sights
of
joy
surrounding
her
on
every
side
the
fair
young
creature
lay
wasting
fast
oliver
crept
away
to
the
old
churchyard
and
sitting
down
on
one
of
the
green
mounds
wept
and
prayed
for
her
in
silence
there
was
such
peace
and
beauty
in
the
scene
so
much
of
brightness
and
mirth
in
the
sunny
landscape
such
blithesome
music
in
the
songs
of
the
summer
birds
such
freedom
in
the
rapid
flight
of
the
rook
careering
overhead
so
much
of
life
and
joyousness
in
all
that
when
the
boy
raised
his
aching
eyes
and
looked
about
the
thought
instinctively
occurred
to
him
that
this
was
not
a
time
for
death
that
rose
could
surely
never
die
when
humbler
things
were
all
so
glad
and
gay
that
graves
were
for
cold
and
cheerless
winter
not
for
sunlight
and
fragrance
he
almost
thought
that
shrouds
were
for
the
old
and
shrunken
and
that
they
never
wrapped
the
young
and
graceful
form
in
their
ghastly
folds
a
knell
from
the
church
bell
broke
harshly
on
these
youthful
thoughts
another
again
it
was
tolling
for
the
funeral
service
a
group
of
humble
mourners
entered
the
gate
wearing
white
favours
for
the
corpse
was
young
they
stood
uncovered
by
a
grave
and
there
was
a
mother
a
mother
once
among
the
weeping
train
but
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
the
birds
sang
on
oliver
turned
homeward
thinking
on
the
many
kindnesses
he
had
received
from
the
young
lady
and
wishing
that
the
time
could
come
again
that
he
might
never
cease
showing
her
how
grateful
and
attached
he
was
he
had
no
cause
for
on
the
score
of
neglect
or
want
of
thought
for
he
had
been
devoted
to
her
service
and
yet
a
hundred
little
occasions
rose
up
before
him
on
which
he
fancied
he
might
have
been
more
zealous
and
more
earnest
and
wished
he
had
been
we
need
be
careful
how
we
deal
with
those
about
us
when
every
death
carries
to
some
small
circle
of
survivors
thoughts
of
so
much
omitted
and
so
little
done
of
so
many
things
forgotten
and
so
many
more
which
might
have
been
repaired
there
is
no
remorse
so
deep
as
that
which
is
unavailing
if
we
would
be
spared
its
tortures
let
us
remember
this
in
time
when
he
reached
home
maylie
was
sitting
in
the
little
parlour
oliver
heart
sank
at
sight
of
her
for
she
had
never
left
the
bedside
of
her
niece
and
he
trembled
to
think
what
change
could
have
driven
her
away
he
learnt
that
she
had
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
from
which
she
would
waken
either
to
recovery
and
life
or
to
bid
them
farewell
and
die
they
sat
listening
and
afraid
to
speak
for
hours
the
untasted
meal
was
removed
with
looks
which
showed
that
their
thoughts
were
elsewhere
they
watched
the
sun
as
he
sank
lower
and
lower
and
at
length
cast
over
sky
and
earth
those
brilliant
hues
which
herald
his
departure
their
quick
ears
caught
the
sound
of
an
approaching
footstep
they
both
involuntarily
darted
to
the
door
as
losberne
entered
of
rose
cried
the
old
lady
me
at
once
i
can
bear
it
anything
but
suspense
oh
tell
me
in
the
name
of
heaven
must
compose
yourself
said
the
doctor
supporting
her
calm
my
dear
pray
me
go
in
god
name
my
dear
child
she
is
dead
she
is
dying
cried
the
doctor
passionately
he
is
good
and
merciful
she
will
live
to
bless
us
all
for
years
to
come
the
lady
fell
upon
her
knees
and
tried
to
fold
her
hands
together
but
the
energy
which
had
supported
her
so
long
fled
up
to
heaven
with
her
first
thanksgiving
and
she
sank
into
the
friendly
arms
which
were
extended
to
receive
her
chapter
xxxiv
contains
some
introductory
particulars
relative
to
a
young
gentleman
who
now
arrives
upon
the
scene
and
a
new
adventure
which
happened
to
oliver
it
was
almost
too
much
happiness
to
bear
oliver
felt
stunned
and
stupefied
by
the
unexpected
intelligence
he
could
not
weep
or
speak
or
rest
he
had
scarcely
the
power
of
understanding
anything
that
had
passed
until
after
a
long
ramble
in
the
quiet
evening
air
a
burst
of
tears
came
to
his
relief
and
he
seemed
to
awaken
all
at
once
to
a
full
sense
of
the
joyful
change
that
had
occurred
and
the
almost
insupportable
load
of
anguish
which
had
been
taken
from
his
breast
the
night
was
fast
closing
in
when
he
returned
homeward
laden
with
flowers
which
he
had
culled
with
peculiar
care
for
the
adornment
of
the
sick
chamber
as
he
walked
briskly
along
the
road
he
heard
behind
him
the
noise
of
some
vehicle
approaching
at
a
furious
pace
looking
round
he
saw
that
it
was
a
driven
at
great
speed
and
as
the
horses
were
galloping
and
the
road
was
narrow
he
stood
leaning
against
a
gate
until
it
should
have
passed
him
as
it
dashed
on
oliver
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
man
in
a
white
nightcap
whose
face
seemed
familiar
to
him
although
his
view
was
so
brief
that
he
could
not
identify
the
person
in
another
second
or
two
the
nightcap
was
thrust
out
of
the
and
a
stentorian
voice
bellowed
to
the
driver
to
stop
which
he
did
as
soon
as
he
could
pull
up
his
horses
then
the
nightcap
once
again
appeared
and
the
same
voice
called
oliver
by
his
name
cried
the
voice
what
the
news
miss
rose
master
it
you
giles
cried
oliver
running
up
to
the
giles
popped
out
his
nightcap
again
preparatory
to
making
some
reply
when
he
was
suddenly
pulled
back
by
a
young
gentleman
who
occupied
the
other
corner
of
the
chaise
and
who
eagerly
demanded
what
was
the
news
a
word
cried
the
gentleman
or
worse
much
better
replied
oliver
hastily
heaven
exclaimed
the
gentleman
are
sure
sir
replied
oliver
change
took
place
only
a
few
hours
ago
and
losberne
says
that
all
danger
is
at
an
end
the
gentleman
said
not
another
word
but
opening
the
leaped
out
and
taking
oliver
hurriedly
by
the
arm
led
him
aside
are
quite
certain
there
is
no
possibility
of
any
mistake
on
your
part
my
boy
is
there
demanded
the
gentleman
in
a
tremulous
voice
not
deceive
me
by
awakening
hopes
that
are
not
to
be
fulfilled
would
not
for
the
world
sir
replied
oliver
you
may
believe
me
losberne
words
were
that
she
would
live
to
bless
us
all
for
many
years
to
come
i
heard
him
say
so
the
tears
stood
in
oliver
eyes
as
he
recalled
the
scene
which
was
the
beginning
of
so
much
happiness
and
the
gentleman
turned
his
face
away
and
remained
silent
for
some
minutes
oliver
thought
he
heard
him
sob
more
than
once
but
he
feared
to
interrupt
him
by
any
fresh
remark
for
he
could
well
guess
what
his
feelings
were
and
so
stood
apart
feigning
to
be
occupied
with
his
nosegay
all
this
time
giles
with
the
white
nightcap
on
had
been
sitting
on
the
steps
of
the
chaise
supporting
an
elbow
on
each
knee
and
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
blue
cotton
dotted
with
white
spots
that
the
honest
fellow
had
not
been
feigning
emotion
was
abundantly
demonstrated
by
the
very
red
eyes
with
which
he
regarded
the
young
gentleman
when
he
turned
round
and
addressed
him
think
you
had
better
go
on
to
my
mother
in
the
chaise
giles
said
he
would
rather
walk
slowly
on
so
as
to
gain
a
little
time
before
i
see
her
you
can
say
i
am
coming
beg
your
pardon
harry
said
giles
giving
a
final
polish
to
his
ruffled
countenance
with
the
handkerchief
if
you
would
leave
the
postboy
to
say
that
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
it
would
be
proper
for
the
maids
to
see
me
in
this
state
sir
i
should
never
have
any
more
authority
with
them
if
they
did
rejoined
harry
maylie
smiling
can
do
as
you
like
let
him
go
on
with
the
luggage
if
you
wish
it
and
do
you
follow
with
us
only
first
exchange
that
nightcap
for
some
more
appropriate
covering
or
we
shall
be
taken
for
madmen
giles
reminded
of
his
unbecoming
costume
snatched
off
and
pocketed
his
nightcap
and
substituted
a
hat
of
grave
and
sober
shape
which
he
took
out
of
the
chaise
this
done
the
postboy
drove
off
giles
maylie
and
oliver
followed
at
their
leisure
as
they
walked
along
oliver
glanced
from
time
to
time
with
much
interest
and
curiosity
at
the
new
comer
he
seemed
about
years
of
age
and
was
of
the
middle
height
his
countenance
was
frank
and
handsome
and
his
demeanor
easy
and
prepossessing
notwithstanding
the
difference
between
youth
and
age
he
bore
so
strong
a
likeness
to
the
old
lady
that
oliver
would
have
had
no
great
difficulty
in
imagining
their
relationship
if
he
had
not
already
spoken
of
her
as
his
mother
maylie
was
anxiously
waiting
to
receive
her
son
when
he
reached
the
cottage
the
meeting
did
not
take
place
without
great
emotion
on
both
sides
whispered
the
young
man
did
you
not
write
before
did
replied
maylie
on
reflection
i
determined
to
keep
back
the
letter
until
i
had
heard
losberne
opinion
why
said
the
young
man
run
the
chance
of
that
occurring
which
so
nearly
happened
if
rose
had
i
can
not
utter
that
word
now
if
this
illness
had
terminated
differently
how
could
you
ever
have
forgiven
yourself
how
could
i
ever
have
know
happiness
again
that
been
the
case
harry
said
maylie
fear
your
happiness
would
have
been
effectually
blighted
and
that
your
arrival
here
a
day
sooner
or
a
day
later
would
have
been
of
very
very
little
import
who
can
wonder
if
it
be
so
mother
rejoined
the
young
man
why
should
i
say
it
is
it
is
you
know
it
mother
you
must
know
it
know
that
she
deserves
the
best
and
purest
love
the
heart
of
man
can
offer
said
maylie
know
that
the
devotion
and
affection
of
her
nature
require
no
ordinary
return
but
one
that
shall
be
deep
and
lasting
if
i
did
not
feel
this
and
know
besides
that
a
changed
behaviour
in
one
she
loved
would
break
her
heart
i
should
not
feel
my
task
so
difficult
of
performance
or
have
to
encounter
so
many
struggles
in
my
own
bosom
when
i
take
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
strict
line
of
duty
is
unkind
mother
said
harry
you
still
suppose
that
i
am
a
boy
ignorant
of
my
own
mind
and
mistaking
the
impulses
of
my
own
soul
think
my
dear
son
returned
maylie
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
youth
has
many
generous
impulses
which
do
not
last
and
that
among
them
are
some
which
being
gratified
become
only
the
more
fleeting
above
all
i
think
said
the
lady
fixing
her
eyes
on
her
son
face
if
an
enthusiastic
ardent
and
ambitious
man
marry
a
wife
on
whose
name
there
is
a
stain
which
though
it
originate
in
no
fault
of
hers
may
be
visited
by
cold
and
sordid
people
upon
her
and
upon
his
children
also
and
in
exact
proportion
to
his
success
in
the
world
be
cast
in
his
teeth
and
made
the
subject
of
sneers
against
him
he
may
no
matter
how
generous
and
good
his
nature
one
day
repent
of
the
connection
he
formed
in
early
life
and
she
may
have
the
pain
of
knowing
that
he
does
so
said
the
young
man
impatiently
would
be
a
selfish
brute
unworthy
alike
of
the
name
of
man
and
of
the
woman
you
describe
who
acted
thus
think
so
now
harry
replied
his
mother
ever
will
said
the
young
man
mental
agony
i
have
suffered
during
the
last
two
days
wrings
from
me
the
avowal
to
you
of
a
passion
which
as
you
well
know
is
not
one
of
yesterday
nor
one
i
have
lightly
formed
on
rose
sweet
gentle
girl
my
heart
is
set
as
firmly
as
ever
heart
of
man
was
set
on
woman
i
have
no
thought
no
view
no
hope
in
life
beyond
her
and
if
you
oppose
me
in
this
great
stake
you
take
my
peace
and
happiness
in
your
hands
and
cast
them
to
the
wind
mother
think
better
of
this
and
of
me
and
do
not
disregard
the
happiness
of
which
you
seem
to
think
so
little
said
maylie
is
because
i
think
so
much
of
warm
and
sensitive
hearts
that
i
would
spare
them
from
being
wounded
but
we
have
said
enough
and
more
than
enough
on
this
matter
just
now
it
rest
with
rose
then
interposed
harry
will
not
press
these
overstrained
opinions
of
yours
so
far
as
to
throw
any
obstacle
in
my
way
will
not
rejoined
maylie
i
would
have
you
consider
considered
was
the
impatient
reply
i
have
considered
years
and
years
i
have
considered
ever
since
i
have
been
capable
of
serious
reflection
my
feelings
remain
unchanged
as
they
ever
will
and
why
should
i
suffer
the
pain
of
a
delay
in
giving
them
vent
which
can
be
productive
of
no
earthly
good
no
before
i
leave
this
place
rose
shall
hear
me
shall
said
maylie
is
something
in
your
manner
which
would
almost
imply
that
she
will
hear
me
coldly
mother
said
the
young
man
coldly
rejoined
the
old
lady
from
it
then
urged
the
young
man
has
formed
no
other
attachment
indeed
replied
his
mother
have
or
i
mistake
too
strong
a
hold
on
her
affections
already
what
i
would
say
resumed
the
old
lady
stopping
her
son
as
he
was
about
to
speak
this
before
you
stake
your
all
on
this
chance
before
you
suffer
yourself
to
be
carried
to
the
highest
point
of
hope
reflect
for
a
few
moments
my
dear
child
on
rose
history
and
consider
what
effect
the
knowledge
of
her
doubtful
birth
may
have
on
her
decision
devoted
as
she
is
to
us
with
all
the
intensity
of
her
noble
mind
and
with
that
perfect
sacrifice
of
self
which
in
all
matters
great
or
trifling
has
always
been
her
characteristic
do
you
mean
i
leave
you
to
discover
replied
maylie
must
go
back
to
her
god
bless
you
shall
see
you
again
said
the
young
man
eagerly
and
by
replied
the
lady
i
leave
rose
will
tell
her
i
am
here
said
harry
course
replied
maylie
say
how
anxious
i
have
been
and
how
much
i
have
suffered
and
how
i
long
to
see
her
you
will
not
refuse
to
do
this
mother
said
the
old
lady
will
tell
her
all
and
pressing
her
hand
affectionately
she
hastened
from
the
room
losberne
and
oliver
had
remained
at
another
end
of
the
apartment
while
this
hurried
conversation
was
proceeding
the
former
now
held
out
his
hand
to
harry
maylie
and
hearty
salutations
were
exchanged
between
them
the
doctor
then
communicated
in
reply
to
multifarious
questions
from
his
young
friend
a
precise
account
of
his
situation
which
was
quite
as
consolatory
and
full
of
promise
as
oliver
statement
had
encouraged
him
to
hope
and
to
the
whole
of
which
giles
who
affected
to
be
busy
about
the
luggage
listened
with
greedy
ears
you
shot
anything
particular
lately
giles
inquired
the
doctor
when
he
had
concluded
particular
sir
replied
giles
colouring
up
to
the
eyes
catching
any
thieves
nor
identifying
any
said
the
doctor
at
all
sir
replied
giles
with
much
gravity
said
the
doctor
am
sorry
to
hear
it
because
you
do
that
sort
of
thing
admirably
pray
how
is
brittles
boy
is
very
well
sir
said
giles
recovering
his
usual
tone
of
patronage
sends
his
respectful
duty
sir
well
said
the
doctor
you
here
reminds
me
giles
that
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
i
was
called
away
so
hurriedly
i
executed
at
the
request
of
your
good
mistress
a
small
commission
in
your
favour
just
step
into
this
corner
a
moment
will
you
giles
walked
into
the
corner
with
much
importance
and
some
wonder
and
was
honoured
with
a
short
whispering
conference
with
the
doctor
on
the
termination
of
which
he
made
a
great
many
bows
and
retired
with
steps
of
unusual
stateliness
the
subject
matter
of
this
conference
was
not
disclosed
in
the
parlour
but
the
kitchen
was
speedily
enlightened
concerning
it
for
giles
walked
straight
thither
and
having
called
for
a
mug
of
ale
announced
with
an
air
of
majesty
which
was
highly
effective
that
it
had
pleased
his
mistress
in
consideration
of
his
gallant
behaviour
on
the
occasion
of
that
attempted
robbery
to
deposit
in
the
local
the
sum
of
pounds
for
his
sole
use
and
benefit
at
this
the
two
lifted
up
their
hands
and
eyes
and
supposed
that
giles
pulling
out
his
replied
no
and
that
if
they
observed
that
he
was
at
all
haughty
to
his
inferiors
he
would
thank
them
to
tell
him
so
and
then
he
made
a
great
many
other
remarks
no
less
illustrative
of
his
humility
which
were
received
with
equal
favour
and
applause
and
were
withal
as
original
and
as
much
to
the
purpose
as
the
remarks
of
great
men
commonly
are
above
stairs
the
remainder
of
the
evening
passed
cheerfully
away
for
the
doctor
was
in
high
spirits
and
however
fatigued
or
thoughtful
harry
maylie
might
have
been
at
first
he
was
not
proof
against
the
worthy
gentleman
good
humour
which
displayed
itself
in
a
great
variety
of
sallies
and
professional
recollections
and
an
abundance
of
small
jokes
which
struck
oliver
as
being
the
drollest
things
he
had
ever
heard
and
caused
him
to
laugh
proportionately
to
the
evident
satisfaction
of
the
doctor
who
laughed
immoderately
at
himself
and
made
harry
laugh
almost
as
heartily
by
the
very
force
of
sympathy
so
they
were
as
pleasant
a
party
as
under
the
circumstances
they
could
well
have
been
and
it
was
late
before
they
retired
with
light
and
thankful
hearts
to
take
that
rest
of
which
after
the
doubt
and
suspense
they
had
recently
undergone
they
stood
much
in
need
oliver
rose
next
morning
in
better
heart
and
went
about
his
usual
occupations
with
more
hope
and
pleasure
than
he
had
known
for
many
days
the
birds
were
once
more
hung
out
to
sing
in
their
old
places
and
the
sweetest
wild
flowers
that
could
be
found
were
once
more
gathered
to
gladden
rose
with
their
beauty
the
melancholy
which
had
seemed
to
the
sad
eyes
of
the
anxious
boy
to
hang
for
days
past
over
every
object
beautiful
as
all
were
was
dispelled
by
magic
the
dew
seemed
to
sparkle
more
brightly
on
the
green
leaves
the
air
to
rustle
among
them
with
a
sweeter
music
and
the
sky
itself
to
look
more
blue
and
bright
such
is
the
influence
which
the
condition
of
our
own
thoughts
exercise
even
over
the
appearance
of
external
objects
men
who
look
on
nature
and
their
and
cry
that
all
is
dark
and
gloomy
are
in
the
right
but
the
sombre
colours
are
reflections
from
their
own
jaundiced
eyes
and
hearts
the
real
hues
are
delicate
and
need
a
clearer
vision
it
is
worthy
of
remark
and
oliver
did
not
fail
to
note
it
at
the
time
that
his
morning
expeditions
were
no
longer
made
alone
harry
maylie
after
the
very
first
morning
when
he
met
oliver
coming
laden
home
was
seized
with
such
a
passion
for
flowers
and
displayed
such
a
taste
in
their
arrangement
as
left
his
young
companion
far
behind
if
oliver
were
behindhand
in
these
respects
he
knew
where
the
best
were
to
be
found
and
morning
after
morning
they
scoured
the
country
together
and
brought
home
the
fairest
that
blossomed
the
window
of
the
young
lady
chamber
was
opened
now
for
she
loved
to
feel
the
rich
summer
air
stream
in
and
revive
her
with
its
freshness
but
there
always
stood
in
water
just
inside
the
lattice
one
particular
little
bunch
which
was
made
up
with
great
care
every
morning
oliver
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
withered
flowers
were
never
thrown
away
although
the
little
vase
was
regularly
replenished
nor
could
he
help
observing
that
whenever
the
doctor
came
into
the
garden
he
invariably
cast
his
eyes
up
to
that
particular
corner
and
nodded
his
head
most
expressively
as
he
set
forth
on
his
morning
walk
pending
these
observations
the
days
were
flying
by
and
rose
was
rapidly
recovering
nor
did
oliver
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
although
the
young
lady
had
not
yet
left
her
chamber
and
there
were
no
evening
walks
save
now
and
then
for
a
short
distance
with
maylie
he
applied
himself
with
redoubled
assiduity
to
the
instructions
of
the
old
gentleman
and
laboured
so
hard
that
his
quick
progress
surprised
even
himself
it
was
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
pursuit
that
he
was
greatly
startled
and
distressed
by
a
most
unexpected
occurrence
the
little
room
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
sit
when
busy
at
his
books
was
on
the
at
the
back
of
the
house
it
was
quite
a
with
a
around
which
were
clusters
of
jessamine
and
honeysuckle
that
crept
over
the
casement
and
filled
the
place
with
their
delicious
perfume
it
looked
into
a
garden
whence
a
opened
into
a
small
paddock
all
beyond
was
fine
and
wood
there
was
no
other
dwelling
near
in
that
direction
and
the
prospect
it
commanded
was
very
extensive
one
beautiful
evening
when
the
first
shades
of
twilight
were
beginning
to
settle
upon
the
earth
oliver
sat
at
this
window
intent
upon
his
books
he
had
been
poring
over
them
for
some
time
and
as
the
day
had
been
uncommonly
sultry
and
he
had
exerted
himself
a
great
deal
it
is
no
disparagement
to
the
authors
whoever
they
may
have
been
to
say
that
gradually
and
by
slow
degrees
he
fell
asleep
there
is
a
kind
of
sleep
that
steals
upon
us
sometimes
which
while
it
holds
the
body
prisoner
does
not
free
the
mind
from
a
sense
of
things
about
it
and
enable
it
to
ramble
at
its
pleasure
so
far
as
an
overpowering
heaviness
a
prostration
of
strength
and
an
utter
inability
to
control
our
thoughts
or
power
of
motion
can
be
called
sleep
this
is
it
and
yet
we
have
a
consciousness
of
all
that
is
going
on
about
us
and
if
we
dream
at
such
a
time
words
which
are
really
spoken
or
sounds
which
really
exist
at
the
moment
accommodate
themselves
with
surprising
readiness
to
our
visions
until
reality
and
imagination
become
so
strangely
blended
that
it
is
afterwards
almost
matter
of
impossibility
to
separate
the
two
nor
is
this
the
most
striking
phenomenon
incidental
to
such
a
state
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
although
our
senses
of
touch
and
sight
be
for
the
time
dead
yet
our
sleeping
thoughts
and
the
visionary
scenes
that
pass
before
us
will
be
influenced
and
materially
influenced
by
the
silent
of
some
external
object
which
may
not
have
been
near
us
when
we
closed
our
eyes
and
of
whose
vicinity
we
have
had
no
waking
consciousness
oliver
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
in
his
own
little
room
that
his
books
were
lying
on
the
table
before
him
that
the
sweet
air
was
stirring
among
the
creeping
plants
outside
and
yet
he
was
asleep
suddenly
the
scene
changed
the
air
became
close
and
confined
and
he
thought
with
a
glow
of
terror
that
he
was
in
the
jew
house
again
there
sat
the
hideous
old
man
in
his
accustomed
corner
pointing
at
him
and
whispering
to
another
man
with
his
face
averted
who
sat
beside
him
my
dear
he
thought
he
heard
the
jew
say
is
he
sure
enough
come
away
the
other
man
seemed
to
answer
i
mistake
him
think
you
if
a
crowd
of
ghosts
were
to
put
themselves
into
his
exact
shape
and
he
stood
amongst
them
there
is
something
that
would
tell
me
how
to
point
him
out
if
you
buried
him
fifty
feet
deep
and
took
me
across
his
grave
i
fancy
i
should
know
if
there
was
a
mark
above
it
that
he
lay
buried
there
the
man
seemed
to
say
this
with
such
dreadful
hatred
that
oliver
awoke
with
the
fear
and
started
up
good
heaven
what
was
that
which
sent
the
blood
tingling
to
his
heart
and
deprived
him
of
his
voice
and
of
power
to
move
there
there
at
the
window
close
before
him
so
close
that
he
could
have
almost
touched
him
before
he
started
back
with
his
eyes
peering
into
the
room
and
meeting
his
there
stood
the
jew
and
beside
him
white
with
rage
or
fear
or
both
were
the
scowling
features
of
the
man
who
had
accosted
him
in
the
it
was
but
an
instant
a
glance
a
flash
before
his
eyes
and
they
were
gone
but
they
had
recognised
him
and
he
them
and
their
look
was
as
firmly
impressed
upon
his
memory
as
if
it
had
been
deeply
carved
in
stone
and
set
before
him
from
his
birth
he
stood
transfixed
for
a
moment
then
leaping
from
the
window
into
the
garden
called
loudly
for
help
chapter
xxxv
containing
the
unsatisfactory
result
of
oliver
adventure
and
a
conversation
of
some
importance
between
harry
maylie
and
rose
when
the
inmates
of
the
house
attracted
by
oliver
cries
hurried
to
the
spot
from
which
they
proceeded
they
found
him
pale
and
agitated
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
meadows
behind
the
house
and
scarcely
able
to
articulate
the
words
jew
the
jew
giles
was
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
what
this
outcry
meant
but
harry
maylie
whose
perceptions
were
something
quicker
and
who
had
heard
oliver
history
from
his
mother
understood
it
at
once
direction
did
he
take
he
asked
catching
up
a
heavy
stick
which
was
standing
in
a
corner
replied
oliver
pointing
out
the
course
the
man
had
taken
missed
them
in
an
instant
they
are
in
the
ditch
said
harry
and
keep
as
near
me
as
you
can
so
saying
he
sprang
over
the
hedge
and
darted
off
with
a
speed
which
rendered
it
matter
of
exceeding
difficulty
for
the
others
to
keep
near
him
giles
followed
as
well
as
he
could
and
oliver
followed
too
and
in
the
course
of
a
minute
or
two
losberne
who
had
been
out
walking
and
just
then
returned
tumbled
over
the
hedge
after
them
and
picking
himself
up
with
more
agility
than
he
could
have
been
supposed
to
possess
struck
into
the
same
course
at
no
contemptible
speed
shouting
all
the
while
most
prodigiously
to
know
what
was
the
matter
on
they
all
went
nor
stopped
they
once
to
breathe
until
the
leader
striking
off
into
an
angle
of
the
field
indicated
by
oliver
began
to
search
narrowly
the
ditch
and
hedge
adjoining
which
afforded
time
for
the
remainder
of
the
party
to
come
up
and
for
oliver
to
communicate
to
losberne
the
circumstances
that
had
led
to
so
vigorous
a
pursuit
the
search
was
all
in
vain
there
were
not
even
the
traces
of
recent
footsteps
to
be
seen
they
stood
now
on
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
commanding
the
open
fields
in
every
direction
for
three
or
four
miles
there
was
the
village
in
the
hollow
on
the
left
but
in
order
to
gain
that
after
pursuing
the
track
oliver
had
pointed
out
the
men
must
have
made
a
circuit
of
open
ground
which
it
was
impossible
they
could
have
accomplished
in
so
short
a
time
a
thick
wood
skirted
the
in
another
direction
but
they
could
not
have
gained
that
covert
for
the
same
reason
must
have
been
a
dream
oliver
said
harry
maylie
no
indeed
sir
replied
oliver
shuddering
at
the
very
recollection
of
the
old
wretch
countenance
saw
him
too
plainly
for
that
i
saw
them
both
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
now
was
the
other
inquired
harry
and
losberne
together
very
same
man
i
told
you
of
who
came
so
suddenly
upon
me
at
the
inn
said
oliver
had
our
eyes
fixed
full
upon
each
other
and
i
could
swear
to
him
took
this
way
demanded
harry
you
sure
i
am
that
the
men
were
at
the
window
replied
oliver
pointing
down
as
he
spoke
to
the
hedge
which
divided
the
from
the
meadow
tall
man
leaped
over
just
there
and
the
jew
running
a
few
paces
to
the
right
crept
through
that
gap
the
two
gentlemen
watched
oliver
earnest
face
as
he
spoke
and
looking
from
him
to
each
other
seemed
to
feel
satisfied
of
the
accuracy
of
what
he
said
still
in
no
direction
were
there
any
appearances
of
the
trampling
of
men
in
hurried
flight
the
grass
was
long
but
it
was
trodden
down
nowhere
save
where
their
own
feet
had
crushed
it
the
sides
and
brinks
of
the
ditches
were
of
damp
clay
but
in
no
one
place
could
they
discern
the
print
of
men
shoes
or
the
slightest
mark
which
would
indicate
that
any
feet
had
pressed
the
ground
for
hours
before
is
strange
said
harry
echoed
the
doctor
and
duff
themselves
could
make
nothing
of
it
notwithstanding
the
evidently
useless
nature
of
their
search
they
did
not
desist
until
the
coming
on
of
night
rendered
its
further
prosecution
hopeless
and
even
then
they
gave
it
up
with
reluctance
giles
was
dispatched
to
the
different
in
the
village
furnished
with
the
best
description
oliver
could
give
of
the
appearance
and
dress
of
the
strangers
of
these
the
jew
was
at
all
events
sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
remembered
supposing
he
had
been
seen
drinking
or
loitering
about
but
giles
returned
without
any
intelligence
calculated
to
dispel
or
lessen
the
mystery
on
the
next
day
fresh
search
was
made
and
the
inquiries
renewed
but
with
no
better
success
on
the
day
following
oliver
and
maylie
repaired
to
the
in
the
hope
of
seeing
or
hearing
something
of
the
men
there
but
this
effort
was
equally
fruitless
after
a
few
days
the
affair
began
to
be
forgotten
as
most
affairs
are
when
wonder
having
no
fresh
food
to
support
it
dies
away
of
itself
meanwhile
rose
was
rapidly
recovering
she
had
left
her
room
was
able
to
go
out
and
mixing
once
more
with
the
family
carried
joy
into
the
hearts
of
all
but
although
this
happy
change
had
a
visible
effect
on
the
little
circle
and
although
cheerful
voices
and
merry
laughter
were
once
more
heard
in
the
cottage
there
was
at
times
an
unwonted
restraint
upon
some
there
even
upon
rose
herself
which
oliver
could
not
fail
to
remark
maylie
and
her
son
were
often
closeted
together
for
a
long
time
and
more
than
once
rose
appeared
with
traces
of
tears
upon
her
face
after
losberne
had
fixed
a
day
for
his
departure
to
chertsey
these
symptoms
increased
and
it
became
evident
that
something
was
in
progress
which
affected
the
peace
of
the
young
lady
and
of
somebody
else
besides
at
length
one
morning
when
rose
was
alone
in
the
harry
maylie
entered
and
with
some
hesitation
begged
permission
to
speak
with
her
for
a
few
moments
few
a
very
few
will
suffice
rose
said
the
young
man
drawing
his
chair
towards
her
i
shall
have
to
say
has
already
presented
itself
to
your
mind
the
most
cherished
hopes
of
my
heart
are
not
unknown
to
you
though
from
my
lips
you
have
not
heard
them
stated
rose
had
been
very
pale
from
the
moment
of
his
entrance
but
that
might
have
been
the
effect
of
her
recent
illness
she
merely
bowed
and
bending
over
some
plants
that
stood
near
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
proceed
i
ought
to
have
left
here
before
said
harry
should
indeed
replied
rose
me
for
saying
so
but
i
wish
you
had
was
brought
here
by
the
most
dreadful
and
agonising
of
all
apprehensions
said
the
young
man
fear
of
losing
the
one
dear
being
on
whom
my
every
wish
and
hope
are
fixed
you
had
been
dying
trembling
between
earth
and
heaven
we
know
that
when
the
young
the
beautiful
and
good
are
visited
with
sickness
their
pure
spirits
insensibly
turn
towards
their
bright
home
of
lasting
rest
we
know
heaven
help
us
that
the
best
and
fairest
of
our
kind
too
often
fade
in
blooming
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
girl
as
these
words
were
spoken
and
when
one
fell
upon
the
flower
over
which
she
bent
and
glistened
brightly
in
its
cup
making
it
more
beautiful
it
seemed
as
though
the
outpouring
of
her
fresh
young
heart
claimed
kindred
naturally
with
the
loveliest
things
in
nature
creature
continued
the
young
man
passionately
creature
as
fair
and
innocent
of
guile
as
one
of
god
own
angels
fluttered
between
life
and
death
oh
who
could
hope
when
the
distant
world
to
which
she
was
akin
half
opened
to
her
view
that
she
would
return
to
the
sorrow
and
calamity
of
this
rose
rose
to
know
that
you
were
passing
away
like
some
soft
shadow
which
a
light
from
above
casts
upon
the
earth
to
have
no
hope
that
you
would
be
spared
to
those
who
linger
here
hardly
to
know
a
reason
why
you
should
be
to
feel
that
you
belonged
to
that
bright
sphere
whither
so
many
of
the
fairest
and
the
best
have
winged
their
early
flight
and
yet
to
pray
amid
all
these
consolations
that
you
might
be
restored
to
those
who
loved
you
these
were
distractions
almost
too
great
to
bear
they
were
mine
by
day
and
night
and
with
them
came
such
a
rushing
torrent
of
fears
and
apprehensions
and
selfish
regrets
lest
you
should
die
and
never
know
how
devotedly
i
loved
you
as
almost
bore
down
sense
and
reason
in
its
course
you
recovered
day
by
day
and
almost
hour
by
hour
some
drop
of
health
came
back
and
mingling
with
the
spent
and
feeble
stream
of
life
which
circulated
languidly
within
you
swelled
it
again
to
a
high
and
rushing
tide
i
have
watched
you
change
almost
from
death
to
life
with
eyes
that
turned
blind
with
their
eagerness
and
deep
affection
do
not
tell
me
that
you
wish
i
had
lost
this
for
it
has
softened
my
heart
to
all
mankind
did
not
mean
that
said
rose
weeping
only
wish
you
had
left
here
that
you
might
have
turned
to
high
and
noble
pursuits
again
to
pursuits
well
worthy
of
you
is
no
pursuit
more
worthy
of
me
more
worthy
of
the
highest
nature
that
exists
than
the
struggle
to
win
such
a
heart
as
yours
said
the
young
man
taking
her
hand
my
own
dear
rose
for
years
for
years
i
have
loved
you
hoping
to
win
my
way
to
fame
and
then
come
proudly
home
and
tell
you
it
had
been
pursued
only
for
you
to
share
thinking
in
my
daydreams
how
i
would
remind
you
in
that
happy
moment
of
the
many
silent
tokens
i
had
given
of
a
boy
attachment
and
claim
your
hand
as
in
redemption
of
some
old
mute
contract
that
had
been
sealed
between
us
that
time
has
not
arrived
but
here
with
not
fame
won
and
no
young
vision
realised
i
offer
you
the
heart
so
long
your
own
and
stake
my
all
upon
the
words
with
which
you
greet
the
offer
behaviour
has
ever
been
kind
and
noble
said
rose
mastering
the
emotions
by
which
she
was
agitated
you
believe
that
i
am
not
insensible
or
ungrateful
so
hear
my
answer
is
that
i
may
endeavour
to
deserve
you
it
is
dear
rose
is
replied
rose
you
must
endeavour
to
forget
me
not
as
your
old
and
companion
for
that
would
wound
me
deeply
but
as
the
object
of
your
love
look
into
the
world
think
how
many
hearts
you
would
be
proud
to
gain
are
there
confide
some
other
passion
to
me
if
you
will
i
will
be
the
truest
warmest
and
most
faithful
friend
you
have
there
was
a
pause
during
which
rose
who
had
covered
her
face
with
one
hand
gave
free
vent
to
her
tears
harry
still
retained
the
other
your
reasons
rose
he
said
at
length
in
a
low
voice
reasons
for
this
decision
have
a
right
to
know
them
rejoined
rose
can
say
nothing
to
alter
my
resolution
it
is
a
duty
that
i
must
perform
i
owe
it
alike
to
others
and
to
myself
yourself
harry
i
owe
it
to
myself
that
i
a
friendless
portionless
girl
with
a
blight
upon
my
name
should
not
give
your
friends
reason
to
suspect
that
i
had
sordidly
yielded
to
your
first
passion
and
fastened
myself
a
clog
on
all
your
hopes
and
projects
i
owe
it
to
you
and
yours
to
prevent
you
from
opposing
in
the
warmth
of
your
generous
nature
this
great
obstacle
to
your
progress
in
the
world
your
inclinations
chime
with
your
sense
of
duty
harry
began
do
not
replied
rose
colouring
deeply
you
return
my
love
said
harry
but
that
dear
rose
say
but
that
and
soften
the
bitterness
of
this
hard
disappointment
i
could
have
done
so
without
doing
heavy
wrong
to
him
i
loved
rejoined
rose
could
have
received
this
declaration
very
differently
said
harry
not
conceal
that
from
me
at
least
rose
could
said
rose
she
added
disengaging
her
hand
should
we
prolong
this
painful
interview
most
painful
to
me
and
yet
productive
of
lasting
happiness
notwithstanding
for
it
be
happiness
to
know
that
i
once
held
the
high
place
in
your
regard
which
i
now
occupy
and
every
triumph
you
achieve
in
life
will
animate
me
with
new
fortitude
and
firmness
farewell
harry
as
we
have
met
we
meet
no
more
but
in
other
relations
than
those
in
which
this
conversation
have
placed
us
we
may
be
long
and
happily
entwined
and
may
every
blessing
that
the
prayers
of
a
true
and
earnest
heart
can
call
down
from
the
source
of
all
truth
and
sincerity
cheer
and
prosper
you
word
rose
said
harry
reason
in
your
own
words
from
your
own
lips
let
me
hear
it
prospect
before
you
answered
rose
firmly
a
brilliant
one
all
the
honours
to
which
great
talents
and
powerful
connections
can
help
men
in
public
life
are
in
store
for
you
but
those
connections
are
proud
and
i
will
neither
mingle
with
such
as
may
hold
in
scorn
the
mother
who
gave
me
life
nor
bring
disgrace
or
failure
on
the
son
of
her
who
has
so
well
supplied
that
mother
place
in
a
word
said
the
young
lady
turning
away
as
her
temporary
firmness
forsook
her
is
a
stain
upon
my
name
which
the
world
visits
on
innocent
heads
i
will
carry
it
into
no
blood
but
my
own
and
the
reproach
shall
rest
alone
on
me
word
more
rose
dearest
rose
one
more
cried
harry
throwing
himself
before
her
i
had
been
less
less
fortunate
the
world
would
call
it
if
some
obscure
and
peaceful
life
had
been
my
destiny
if
i
had
been
poor
sick
helpless
would
you
have
turned
from
me
then
or
has
my
probable
advancement
to
riches
and
honour
given
this
scruple
birth
not
press
me
to
reply
answered
rose
question
does
not
arise
and
never
will
it
is
unfair
almost
unkind
to
urge
it
your
answer
be
what
i
almost
dare
to
hope
it
is
retorted
harry
will
shed
a
gleam
of
happiness
upon
my
lonely
way
and
light
the
path
before
me
it
is
not
an
idle
thing
to
do
so
much
by
the
utterance
of
a
few
brief
words
for
one
who
loves
you
beyond
all
else
oh
rose
in
the
name
of
my
ardent
and
enduring
attachment
in
the
name
of
all
i
have
suffered
for
you
and
all
you
doom
me
to
undergo
answer
me
this
one
question
if
your
lot
had
been
differently
cast
rejoined
rose
you
had
been
even
a
little
but
not
so
far
above
me
if
i
could
have
been
a
help
and
comfort
to
you
in
any
humble
scene
of
peace
and
retirement
and
not
a
blot
and
drawback
in
ambitious
and
distinguished
crowds
i
should
have
been
spared
this
trial
i
have
every
reason
to
be
happy
very
happy
now
but
then
harry
i
own
i
should
have
been
happier
busy
recollections
of
old
hopes
cherished
as
a
girl
long
ago
crowded
into
the
mind
of
rose
while
making
this
avowal
but
they
brought
tears
with
them
as
old
hopes
will
when
they
come
back
withered
and
they
relieved
her
can
not
help
this
weakness
and
it
makes
my
purpose
stronger
said
rose
extending
her
hand
must
leave
you
now
indeed
ask
one
promise
said
harry
and
only
once
more
say
within
a
year
but
it
may
be
much
sooner
i
may
speak
to
you
again
on
this
subject
for
the
last
time
to
press
me
to
alter
my
right
determination
replied
rose
with
a
melancholy
smile
will
be
useless
said
harry
hear
you
repeat
it
if
you
will
finally
repeat
it
i
will
lay
at
your
feet
whatever
of
station
of
fortune
i
may
possess
and
if
you
still
adhere
to
your
present
resolution
will
not
seek
by
word
or
act
to
change
it
let
it
be
so
rejoined
rose
is
but
one
pang
the
more
and
by
that
time
i
may
be
enabled
to
bear
it
better
she
extended
her
hand
again
but
the
young
man
caught
her
to
his
bosom
and
imprinting
one
kiss
on
her
beautiful
forehead
hurried
from
the
room
chapter
xxxvi
is
a
very
short
one
and
may
appear
of
no
great
importance
in
its
place
but
it
should
be
read
notwithstanding
as
a
sequel
to
the
last
and
a
key
to
one
that
will
follow
when
its
time
arrives
so
you
are
resolved
to
be
my
travelling
companion
this
morning
eh
said
the
doctor
as
harry
maylie
joined
him
and
oliver
at
the
you
are
not
in
the
same
mind
or
intention
two
together
will
tell
me
a
different
tale
one
of
these
days
said
harry
colouring
without
any
perceptible
reason
hope
i
may
have
good
cause
to
do
so
replied
losberne
i
confess
i
do
think
i
shall
but
yesterday
morning
you
had
made
up
your
mind
in
a
great
hurry
to
stay
here
and
to
accompany
your
mother
like
a
dutiful
son
to
the
before
noon
you
announce
that
you
are
going
to
do
me
the
honour
of
accompanying
me
as
far
as
i
go
on
your
road
to
london
and
at
night
you
urge
me
with
great
mystery
to
start
before
the
ladies
are
stirring
the
consequence
of
which
is
that
young
oliver
here
is
pinned
down
to
his
breakfast
when
he
ought
to
be
ranging
the
meadows
after
botanical
phenomena
of
all
kinds
too
bad
is
it
oliver
should
have
been
very
sorry
not
to
have
been
at
home
when
you
and
maylie
went
away
sir
rejoined
oliver
a
fine
fellow
said
the
doctor
shall
come
and
see
me
when
you
return
but
to
speak
seriously
harry
has
any
communication
from
the
great
nobs
produced
this
sudden
anxiety
on
your
part
to
be
gone
great
nobs
replied
harry
which
designation
i
presume
you
include
my
most
stately
uncle
have
not
communicated
with
me
at
all
since
i
have
been
here
nor
at
this
time
of
the
year
is
it
likely
that
anything
would
occur
to
render
necessary
my
immediate
attendance
among
them
said
the
doctor
are
a
queer
fellow
but
of
course
they
will
get
you
into
parliament
at
the
election
before
christmas
and
these
sudden
shiftings
and
changes
are
no
bad
preparation
for
political
life
there
something
in
that
good
training
is
always
desirable
whether
the
race
be
for
place
cup
or
sweepstakes
harry
maylie
looked
as
if
he
could
have
followed
up
this
short
dialogue
by
one
or
two
remarks
that
would
have
staggered
the
doctor
not
a
little
but
he
contented
himself
with
saying
shall
see
and
pursued
the
subject
no
farther
the
drove
up
to
the
door
shortly
afterwards
and
giles
coming
in
for
the
luggage
the
good
doctor
bustled
out
to
see
it
packed
said
harry
maylie
in
a
low
voice
me
speak
a
word
with

into
the

which
maylie
beckoned

surprised
at
the
mixture
of
sadness
and
boisterous
spirits

his
whole
behaviour
displayed

harry
laying
his
hand
upon
his
arm

sir
quite
replied
oliver
would
rather
you
did
not
mention
it
to
them
said
harry
hurrying
over
his
words
it
might
make
my
mother
anxious
to
write
to
me
oftener
and
it
is
a
trouble
and
worry
to
her
let
it
be
a
secret
between
you
and
me
and
mind
you
tell
me
everything
i
depend
upon
you
oliver
quite
elated
and
honoured
by
a
sense
of
his
importance
faithfully
promised
to
be
secret
and
explicit
in
his
communications
maylie
took
leave
of
him
with
many
assurances
of
his
regard
and
protection
the
doctor
was
in
the
chaise
giles
who
it
had
been
arranged
should
be
left
behind
held
the
door
open
in
his
hand
and
the
were
in
the
garden
looking
on
harry
cast
one
slight
glance
at
the
latticed
window
and
jumped
into
the
carriage
on
he
cried
fast
full
gallop
nothing
short
of
flying
will
keep
pace
with
me
cried
the
doctor
letting
down
the
front
glass
in
a
great
hurry
and
shouting
to
the
postillion
very
short
of
flying
will
keep
pace
with
do
you
hear
jingling
and
clattering
till
distance
rendered
its
noise
inaudible
and
its
rapid
progress
only
perceptible
to
the
eye
the
vehicle
wound
its
way
along
the
road
almost
hidden
in
a
cloud
of
dust
now
wholly
disappearing
and
now
becoming
visible
again
as
intervening
objects
or
the
intricacies
of
the
way
permitted
it
was
not
until
even
the
dusty
cloud
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
that
the
gazers
dispersed
and
there
was
one
who
remained
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
spot
where
the
carriage
had
disappeared
long
after
it
was
many
miles
away
for
behind
the
white
curtain
which
had
shrouded
her
from
view
when
harry
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
window
sat
rose
herself
seems
in
high
spirits
and
happy
she
said
at
length
feared
for
a
time
he
might
be
otherwise
i
was
mistaken
i
am
very
very
glad
tears
are
signs
of
gladness
as
well
as
grief
but
those
which
coursed
down
rose
face
as
she
sat
pensively
at
the
window
still
gazing
in
the
same
direction
seemed
to
tell
more
of
sorrow
than
of
joy
chapter
xxxvii
in
which
the
reader
may
perceive
a
contrast
not
uncommon
in
matrimonial
cases
bumble
sat
in
the
workhouse
parlour
with
his
eyes
moodily
fixed
on
the
cheerless
grate
whence
as
it
was
summer
time
no
brighter
gleam
proceeded
than
the
reflection
of
certain
sickly
rays
of
the
sun
which
were
sent
back
from
its
cold
and
shining
surface
a
paper
dangled
from
the
ceiling
to
which
he
occasionally
raised
his
eyes
in
gloomy
thought
and
as
the
heedless
insects
hovered
round
the
gaudy
bumble
would
heave
a
deep
sigh
while
a
more
gloomy
shadow
overspread
his
countenance
bumble
was
meditating
it
might
be
that
the
insects
brought
to
mind
some
painful
passage
in
his
own
past
life
nor
was
bumble
gloom
the
only
thing
calculated
to
awaken
a
pleasing
melancholy
in
the
bosom
of
a
spectator
there
were
not
wanting
other
appearances
and
those
closely
connected
with
his
own
person
which
announced
that
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
the
position
of
his
affairs
the
laced
coat
and
the
cocked
hat
where
were
they
he
still
wore
and
dark
cotton
stockings
on
his
nether
limbs
but
they
were
not
breeches
the
coat
was
and
in
that
respect
like
coat
but
oh
how
different
the
mighty
cocked
hat
was
replaced
by
a
modest
round
one
bumble
was
no
longer
a
beadle
there
are
some
promotions
in
life
which
independent
of
the
more
substantial
rewards
they
offer
require
peculiar
value
and
dignity
from
the
coats
and
waistcoats
connected
with
them
a
has
his
uniform
a
bishop
his
silk
apron
a
counsellor
his
silk
gown
a
beadle
his
cocked
hat
strip
the
bishop
of
his
apron
or
the
beadle
of
his
hat
and
lace
what
are
they
men
mere
men
dignity
and
even
holiness
too
sometimes
are
more
questions
of
coat
and
waistcoat
than
some
people
imagine
bumble
had
married
corney
and
was
master
of
the
workhouse
another
beadle
had
come
into
power
on
him
the
cocked
hat
coat
and
staff
had
all
three
descended
two
months
it
was
done
said
bumble
with
a
sigh
seems
a
age
bumble
might
have
meant
that
he
had
concentrated
a
whole
existence
of
happiness
into
the
short
space
of
eight
weeks
but
the
sigh
there
was
a
vast
deal
of
meaning
in
the
sigh
sold
myself
said
bumble
pursuing
the
same
train
of
relection
six
teaspoons
a
pair
of
and
a
with
a
small
quantity
of
furniture
and
twenty
pound
in
money
i
went
very
reasonable
cheap
dirt
cheap
cried
a
shrill
voice
in
bumble
ear
would
have
been
dear
at
any
price
and
dear
enough
i
paid
for
you
lord
above
knows
that
bumble
turned
and
encountered
the
face
of
his
interesting
consort
who
imperfectly
comprehending
the
few
words
she
had
overheard
of
his
complaint
had
hazarded
the
foregoing
remark
at
a
venture
bumble
said
bumble
with
a
sentimental
sternness
cried
the
lady
the
goodness
to
look
at
me
said
bumble
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
if
she
stands
such
a
eye
as
that
said
bumble
to
himself
can
stand
anything
it
is
a
eye
i
never
knew
to
fail
with
paupers
if
it
fails
with
her
my
power
is
gone
whether
an
exceedingly
small
expansion
of
eye
be
sufficient
to
quell
paupers
who
being
lightly
fed
are
in
no
very
high
condition
or
whether
the
late
corney
was
particularly
proof
against
eagle
glances
are
matters
of
opinion
the
matter
of
fact
is
that
the
matron
was
in
no
way
overpowered
by
bumble
scowl
but
on
the
contrary
treated
it
with
great
disdain
and
even
raised
a
laugh
thereat
which
sounded
as
though
it
were
genuine
on
hearing
this
most
unexpected
sound
bumble
looked
first
incredulous
and
afterwards
amazed
he
then
relapsed
into
his
former
state
nor
did
he
rouse
himself
until
his
attention
was
again
awakened
by
the
voice
of
his
partner
you
going
to
sit
snoring
there
all
day
inquired
bumble
am
going
to
sit
here
as
long
as
i
think
proper
rejoined
bumble
although
i
was
snoring
i
shall
snore
gape
sneeze
laugh
or
cry
as
the
humour
strikes
me
such
being
my
prerogative
prerogative
sneered
bumble
with
ineffable
contempt
said
the
word
said
bumble
prerogative
of
a
man
is
to
command
what
the
prerogative
of
a
woman
in
the
name
of
goodness
cried
the
relict
of
corney
deceased
obey
thundered
bumble
late
unfortunate
husband
should
have
taught
it
you
and
then
perhaps
he
might
have
been
alive
now
i
wish
he
was
poor
man
bumble
seeing
at
a
glance
that
the
decisive
moment
had
now
arrived
and
that
a
blow
struck
for
the
mastership
on
one
side
or
other
must
necessarily
be
final
and
conclusive
no
sooner
heard
this
allusion
to
the
dead
and
gone
than
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
with
a
loud
scream
that
bumble
was
a
brute
fell
into
a
paroxysm
of
tears
but
tears
were
not
the
things
to
find
their
way
to
bumble
soul
his
heart
was
waterproof
like
washable
beaver
hats
that
improve
with
rain
his
nerves
were
rendered
stouter
and
more
vigorous
by
showers
of
tears
which
being
tokens
of
weakness
and
so
far
tacit
admissions
of
his
own
power
pleased
and
exalted
him
he
eyed
his
good
lady
with
looks
of
great
satisfaction
and
begged
in
an
encouraging
manner
that
she
should
cry
her
hardest
the
exercise
being
looked
upon
by
the
faculty
as
strongly
conducive
to
health
opens
the
lungs
washes
the
countenance
exercises
the
eyes
and
softens
down
the
temper
said
bumble
cry
away
as
he
discharged
himself
of
this
pleasantry
bumble
took
his
hat
from
a
peg
and
putting
it
on
rather
rakishly
on
one
side
as
a
man
might
who
felt
he
had
asserted
his
superiority
in
a
becoming
manner
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
sauntered
towards
the
door
with
much
ease
and
waggishness
depicted
in
his
whole
appearance
now
corney
that
was
had
tried
the
tears
because
they
were
less
troublesome
than
a
manual
assault
but
she
was
quite
prepared
to
make
trial
of
the
latter
mode
of
proceeding
as
bumble
was
not
long
in
discovering
the
first
proof
he
experienced
of
the
fact
was
conveyed
in
a
hollow
sound
immediately
succeeded
by
the
sudden
flying
off
of
his
hat
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
this
preliminary
proceeding
laying
bare
his
head
the
expert
lady
clasping
him
tightly
round
the
throat
with
one
hand
inflicted
a
shower
of
blows
dealt
with
singular
vigour
and
dexterity
upon
it
with
the
other
this
done
she
created
a
little
variety
by
scratching
his
face
and
tearing
his
hair
and
having
by
this
time
inflicted
as
much
punishment
as
she
deemed
necessary
for
the
offence
she
pushed
him
over
a
chair
which
was
luckily
well
situated
for
the
purpose
and
defied
him
to
talk
about
his
prerogative
again
if
he
dared
up
said
bumble
in
a
voice
of
command
take
yourself
away
from
here
unless
you
want
me
to
do
something
desperate
bumble
rose
with
a
very
rueful
countenance
wondering
much
what
something
desperate
might
be
picking
up
his
hat
he
looked
towards
the
door
you
going
demanded
bumble
my
dear
certainly
rejoined
bumble
making
a
quicker
motion
towards
the
door
did
intend
to
i
going
my
dear
you
are
so
very
violent
that
really
i
at
this
instant
bumble
stepped
hastily
forward
to
replace
the
carpet
which
had
been
kicked
up
in
the
scuffle
bumble
immediately
darted
out
of
the
room
without
bestowing
another
thought
on
his
unfinished
sentence
leaving
the
late
corney
in
full
possession
of
the
field
bumble
was
fairly
taken
by
surprise
and
fairly
beaten
he
had
a
decided
propensity
for
bullying
derived
no
inconsiderable
pleasure
from
the
exercise
of
petty
cruelty
and
consequently
was
it
is
needless
to
say
a
coward
this
is
by
no
means
a
disparagement
to
his
character
for
many
official
personages
who
are
held
in
high
respect
and
admiration
are
the
victims
of
similar
infirmities
the
remark
is
made
indeed
rather
in
his
favour
than
otherwise
and
with
a
view
of
impressing
the
reader
with
a
just
sense
of
his
qualifications
for
office
but
the
measure
of
his
degradation
was
not
yet
full
after
making
a
tour
of
the
house
and
thinking
for
the
first
time
that
the
really
were
too
hard
on
people
and
that
men
who
ran
away
from
their
wives
leaving
them
chargeable
to
the
parish
ought
in
justice
to
be
visited
with
no
punishment
at
all
but
rather
rewarded
as
meritorious
individuals
who
had
suffered
much
bumble
came
to
a
room
where
some
of
the
female
paupers
were
usually
employed
in
washing
the
parish
linen
when
the
sound
of
voices
in
conversation
now
proceeded
said
bumble
summoning
up
all
his
native
dignity
women
at
least
shall
continue
to
respect
the
prerogative
hallo
hallo
there
what
do
you
mean
by
this
noise
you
hussies
with
these
words
bumble
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
with
a
very
fierce
and
angry
manner
which
was
at
once
exchanged
for
a
most
humiliated
and
cowering
air
as
his
eyes
unexpectedly
rested
on
the
form
of
his
lady
wife
dear
said
bumble
did
know
you
were
here
know
i
was
here
repeated
bumble
do
do
here
thought
they
were
talking
rather
too
much
to
be
doing
their
work
properly
my
dear
replied
bumble
glancing
distractedly
at
a
couple
of
old
women
at
the
who
were
comparing
notes
of
admiration
at
the
humility
thought
they
were
talking
too
much
said
bumble
business
is
it
of
yours
my
dear
urged
bumble
submissively
business
is
it
of
yours
demanded
bumble
again
very
true
you
matron
here
my
dear
submitted
bumble
i
thought
you
might
be
in
the
way
just
then
tell
you
what
bumble
returned
his
lady
do
want
any
of
your
interference
you
a
great
deal
too
fond
of
poking
your
nose
into
things
that
do
concern
you
making
everybody
in
the
house
laugh
the
moment
your
back
is
turned
and
making
yourself
look
like
a
fool
every
hour
in
the
day
be
off
come
bumble
seeing
with
excruciating
feelings
the
delight
of
the
two
old
paupers
who
were
tittering
together
most
rapturously
hesitated
for
an
instant
bumble
whose
patience
brooked
no
delay
caught
up
a
bowl
of
and
motioning
him
towards
the
door
ordered
him
instantly
to
depart
on
pain
of
receiving
the
contents
upon
his
portly
person
what
could
bumble
do
he
looked
dejectedly
round
and
slunk
away
and
as
he
reached
the
door
the
titterings
of
the
paupers
broke
into
a
shrill
chuckle
of
irrepressible
delight
it
wanted
but
this
he
was
degraded
in
their
eyes
he
had
lost
caste
and
station
before
the
very
paupers
he
had
fallen
from
all
the
height
and
pomp
of
beadleship
to
the
lowest
depth
of
the
most
snubbed
in
two
months
said
bumble
filled
with
dismal
thoughts
months
no
more
than
two
months
ago
i
was
not
only
my
own
master
but
everybody
else
so
far
as
the
porochial
workhouse
was
concerned
and
now
it
was
too
much
bumble
boxed
the
ears
of
the
boy
who
opened
the
gate
for
him
for
he
had
reached
the
portal
in
his
reverie
and
walked
distractedly
into
the
street
he
walked
up
one
street
and
down
another
until
exercise
had
abated
the
first
passion
of
his
grief
and
then
the
revulsion
of
feeling
made
him
thirsty
he
passed
a
great
many
but
at
length
paused
before
one
in
a
whose
parlour
as
he
gathered
from
a
hasty
peep
over
the
blinds
was
deserted
save
by
one
solitary
customer
it
began
to
rain
heavily
at
the
moment
this
determined
him
bumble
stepped
in
and
ordering
something
to
drink
as
he
passed
the
bar
entered
the
apartment
into
which
he
had
looked
from
the
street
the
man
who
was
seated
there
was
tall
and
dark
and
wore
a
large
cloak
he
had
the
air
of
a
stranger
and
seemed
by
a
certain
haggardness
in
his
look
as
well
as
by
the
dusty
soils
on
his
dress
to
have
travelled
some
distance
he
eyed
bumble
askance
as
he
entered
but
scarcely
deigned
to
nod
his
head
in
acknowledgment
of
his
salutation
bumble
had
quite
dignity
enough
for
two
supposing
even
that
the
stranger
had
been
more
familiar
so
he
drank
his
in
silence
and
read
the
paper
with
great
show
of
pomp
and
circumstance
it
so
happened
however
as
it
will
happen
very
often
when
men
fall
into
company
under
such
circumstances
that
bumble
felt
every
now
and
then
a
powerful
inducement
which
he
could
not
resist
to
steal
a
look
at
the
stranger
and
that
whenever
he
did
so
he
withdrew
his
eyes
in
some
confusion
to
find
that
the
stranger
was
at
that
moment
stealing
a
look
at
him
bumble
awkwardness
was
enhanced
by
the
very
remarkable
expression
of
the
stranger
eye
which
was
keen
and
bright
but
shadowed
by
a
scowl
of
distrust
and
suspicion
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
observed
before
and
repulsive
to
behold
when
they
had
encountered
each
other
glance
several
times
in
this
way
the
stranger
in
a
harsh
deep
voice
broke
silence
you
looking
for
me
he
said
you
peered
in
at
the
window
that
i
am
aware
of
unless
you
here
bumble
stopped
short
for
he
was
curious
to
know
the
stranger
name
and
thought
in
his
impatience
he
might
supply
the
blank
see
you
were
not
said
the
stranger
an
expression
of
quiet
sarcasm
playing
about
his
mouth
you
have
known
my
name
you
do
know
it
i
would
recommend
you
not
to
ask
for
it
meant
no
harm
young
man
observed
bumble
majestically
have
done
none
said
the
stranger
another
silence
succeeded
this
short
dialogue
which
was
again
broken
by
the
stranger
have
seen
you
before
i
think
said
he
were
differently
dressed
at
that
time
and
i
only
passed
you
in
the
street
but
i
should
know
you
again
you
were
beadle
here
once
were
you
not
was
said
bumble
in
some
surprise
beadle
so
rejoined
the
other
nodding
his
head
was
in
that
character
i
saw
you
what
are
you
now
of
the
workhouse
rejoined
bumble
slowly
and
impressively
to
check
any
undue
familiarity
the
stranger
might
otherwise
assume
of
the
workhouse
young
man
have
the
same
eye
to
your
own
interest
that
you
always
had
i
doubt
not
resumed
the
stranger
looking
keenly
into
eyes
as
he
raised
them
in
astonishment
at
the
question
scruple
to
answer
freely
man
i
know
you
pretty
well
you
see
suppose
a
married
man
replied
bumble
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
surveying
the
stranger
from
head
to
foot
in
evident
perplexity
not
more
averse
to
turning
an
honest
penny
when
he
can
than
a
single
one
porochial
officers
are
not
so
well
paid
that
they
can
afford
to
refuse
any
little
extra
fee
when
it
comes
to
them
in
a
civil
and
proper
manner
the
stranger
smiled
and
nodded
his
head
again
as
much
to
say
he
had
not
mistaken
his
man
then
rang
the
bell
this
glass
again
he
said
handing
bumble
empty
tumbler
to
the
landlord
it
be
strong
and
hot
you
like
it
so
i
suppose
too
strong
replied
bumble
with
a
delicate
cough
understand
what
that
means
landlord
said
the
stranger
drily
the
host
smiled
disappeared
and
shortly
afterwards
returned
with
a
steaming
jorum
of
which
the
first
gulp
brought
the
water
into
bumble
eyes
listen
to
me
said
the
stranger
after
closing
the
door
and
window
came
down
to
this
place
to
find
you
out
and
by
one
of
those
chances
which
the
devil
throws
in
the
way
of
his
friends
sometimes
you
walked
into
the
very
room
i
was
sitting
in
while
you
were
uppermost
in
my
mind
i
want
some
information
from
you
i
ask
you
to
give
it
for
nothing
slight
as
it
is
put
up
that
to
begin
with
as
he
spoke
he
pushed
a
couple
of
sovereigns
across
the
table
to
his
companion
carefully
as
though
unwilling
that
the
chinking
of
money
should
be
heard
without
when
bumble
had
scrupulously
examined
the
coins
to
see
that
they
were
genuine
and
had
put
them
up
with
much
satisfaction
in
his
he
went
on
your
memory
back
let
me
see
twelve
years
last
winter
a
long
time
said
bumble
good
i
done
it
scene
the
workhouse
the
time
night
the
place
the
crazy
hole
wherever
it
was
in
which
miserable
drabs
brought
forth
the
life
and
health
so
often
denied
to
themselves
gave
birth
to
puling
children
for
the
parish
to
rear
and
hid
their
shame
rot
in
the
grave
room
i
suppose
said
bumble
not
quite
following
the
stranger
excited
description
said
the
stranger
boy
was
born
there
many
boys
observed
bumble
shaking
his
head
despondingly
murrain
on
the
young
devils
cried
the
stranger
speak
of
one
a
boy
who
was
apprenticed
down
here
to
a
i
wish
he
had
made
his
coffin
and
screwed
his
body
in
it
and
who
afterwards
ran
away
to
london
as
it
was
supposed
you
mean
oliver
young
twist
said
bumble
remember
him
of
course
there
was
a
obstinater
young
rascal
not
of
him
i
want
to
hear
i
heard
enough
of
him
said
the
stranger
stopping
bumble
in
the
outset
of
a
tirade
on
the
subject
of
poor
oliver
vices
of
a
woman
the
hag
that
nursed
his
mother
where
is
she
is
she
said
bumble
whom
the
had
rendered
facetious
would
be
hard
to
tell
there
no
midwifery
there
whichever
place
she
gone
to
so
i
suppose
she
out
of
employment
anyway
do
you
mean
demanded
the
stranger
sternly
she
died
last
winter
rejoined
bumble
the
man
looked
fixedly
at
him
when
he
had
given
this
information
and
although
he
did
not
withdraw
his
eyes
for
some
time
afterwards
his
gaze
gradually
became
vacant
and
abstracted
and
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
for
some
time
he
appeared
doubtful
whether
he
ought
to
be
relieved
or
disappointed
by
the
intelligence
but
at
length
he
breathed
more
freely
and
withdrawing
his
eyes
observed
that
it
was
no
great
matter
with
that
he
rose
as
if
to
depart
but
bumble
was
cunning
enough
and
he
at
once
saw
that
an
opportunity
was
opened
for
the
lucrative
disposal
of
some
secret
in
the
possession
of
his
better
half
he
well
remembered
the
night
of
old
sally
death
which
the
occurrences
of
that
day
had
given
him
good
reason
to
recollect
as
the
occasion
on
which
he
had
proposed
to
corney
and
although
that
lady
had
never
confided
to
him
the
disclosure
of
which
she
had
been
the
solitary
witness
he
had
heard
enough
to
know
that
it
related
to
something
that
had
occurred
in
the
old
attendance
as
workhouse
nurse
upon
the
young
mother
of
oliver
twist
hastily
calling
this
circumstance
to
mind
he
informed
the
stranger
with
an
air
of
mystery
that
one
woman
had
been
closeted
with
the
old
harridan
shortly
before
she
died
and
that
she
could
as
he
had
reason
to
believe
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
of
his
inquiry
can
i
find
her
said
the
stranger
thrown
off
his
guard
and
plainly
showing
that
all
his
fears
whatever
they
were
were
aroused
afresh
by
the
intelligence
through
me
rejoined
bumble
cried
the
stranger
hastily
rejoined
bumble
nine
in
the
evening
said
the
stranger
producing
a
scrap
of
paper
and
writing
down
upon
it
an
obscure
address
by
the
in
characters
that
betrayed
his
agitation
nine
in
the
evening
bring
her
to
me
there
i
need
tell
you
to
be
secret
it
your
interest
with
these
words
he
led
the
way
to
the
door
after
stopping
to
pay
for
the
liquor
that
had
been
drunk
shortly
remarking
that
their
roads
were
different
he
departed
without
more
ceremony
than
an
emphatic
repetition
of
the
hour
of
appointment
for
the
following
night
on
glancing
at
the
address
the
parochial
functionary
observed
that
it
contained
no
name
the
stranger
had
not
gone
far
so
he
made
after
him
to
ask
it
do
you
want
cried
the
man
turning
quickly
round
as
bumble
touched
him
on
the
arm
me
to
ask
a
question
said
the
other
pointing
to
the
scrap
of
paper
name
am
i
to
ask
for
rejoined
the
man
and
strode
hastily
away
chapter
xxxviii
containing
an
account
of
what
passed
between
and
bumble
and
monks
at
their
nocturnal
interview
it
was
a
dull
close
overcast
summer
evening
the
clouds
which
had
been
threatening
all
day
spread
out
in
a
dense
and
sluggish
mass
of
vapour
already
yielded
large
drops
of
rain
and
seemed
to
presage
a
violent
when
and
bumble
turning
out
of
the
main
street
of
the
town
directed
their
course
towards
a
scattered
little
colony
of
ruinous
houses
distant
from
it
some
mile
and
or
thereabouts
and
erected
on
a
low
unwholesome
swamp
bordering
upon
the
river
they
were
both
wrapped
in
old
and
shabby
outer
garments
which
might
perhaps
serve
the
double
purpose
of
protecting
their
persons
from
the
rain
and
sheltering
them
from
observation
the
husband
carried
a
lantern
from
which
however
no
light
yet
shone
and
trudged
on
a
few
paces
in
front
as
though
the
way
being
dirty
to
give
his
wife
the
benefit
of
treading
in
his
heavy
footprints
they
went
on
in
profound
silence
every
now
and
then
bumble
relaxed
his
pace
and
turned
his
head
as
if
to
make
sure
that
his
helpmate
was
following
then
discovering
that
she
was
close
at
his
heels
he
mended
his
rate
of
walking
and
proceeded
at
a
considerable
increase
of
speed
towards
their
place
of
destination
this
was
far
from
being
a
place
of
doubtful
character
for
it
had
long
been
known
as
the
residence
of
none
but
low
ruffians
who
under
various
pretences
of
living
by
their
labour
subsisted
chiefly
on
plunder
and
crime
it
was
a
collection
of
mere
hovels
some
hastily
built
with
loose
bricks
others
of
old
jumbled
together
without
any
attempt
at
order
or
arrangement
and
planted
for
the
most
part
within
a
few
feet
of
the
river
bank
a
few
leaky
boats
drawn
up
on
the
mud
and
made
fast
to
the
dwarf
wall
which
skirted
it
and
here
and
there
an
oar
or
coil
of
rope
appeared
at
first
to
indicate
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
miserable
cottages
pursued
some
avocation
on
the
river
but
a
glance
at
the
shattered
and
useless
condition
of
the
articles
thus
displayed
would
have
led
a
without
much
difficulty
to
the
conjecture
that
they
were
disposed
there
rather
for
the
preservation
of
appearances
than
with
any
view
to
their
being
actually
employed
in
the
heart
of
this
cluster
of
huts
and
skirting
the
river
which
its
upper
stories
overhung
stood
a
large
building
formerly
used
as
a
manufactory
of
some
kind
it
had
in
its
day
probably
furnished
employment
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
tenements
but
it
had
long
since
gone
to
ruin
the
rat
the
worm
and
the
action
of
the
damp
had
weakened
and
rotted
the
piles
on
which
it
stood
and
a
considerable
portion
of
the
building
had
already
sunk
down
into
the
water
while
the
remainder
tottering
and
bending
over
the
dark
stream
seemed
to
wait
a
favourable
opportunity
of
following
its
old
companion
and
involving
itself
in
the
same
fate
it
was
before
this
ruinous
building
that
the
worthy
couple
paused
as
the
first
peal
of
distant
thunder
reverberated
in
the
air
and
the
rain
commenced
pouring
violently
down
place
should
be
somewhere
here
said
bumble
consulting
a
scrap
of
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
there
cried
a
voice
from
above
following
the
sound
bumble
raised
his
head
and
descried
a
man
looking
out
of
a
door
on
the
second
story
still
a
minute
cried
the
voice
be
with
you
directly
with
which
the
head
disappeared
and
the
door
closed
that
the
man
asked
bumble
good
lady
bumble
nodded
in
the
affirmative
mind
what
i
told
you
said
the
matron
be
careful
to
say
as
little
as
you
can
or
you
betray
us
at
once
bumble
who
had
eyed
the
building
with
very
rueful
looks
was
apparently
about
to
express
some
doubts
relative
to
the
advisability
of
proceeding
any
further
with
the
enterprise
just
then
when
he
was
prevented
by
the
appearance
of
monks
who
opened
a
small
door
near
which
they
stood
and
beckoned
them
inwards
in
he
cried
impatiently
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
ground
keep
me
here
the
woman
who
had
hesitated
at
first
walked
boldly
in
without
any
other
invitation
bumble
who
was
ashamed
or
afraid
to
lag
behind
followed
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
and
with
scarcely
any
of
that
remarkable
dignity
which
was
usually
his
chief
characteristic
the
devil
made
you
stand
lingering
there
in
the
wet
said
monks
turning
round
and
addressing
bumble
after
he
had
bolted
the
door
behind
them
we
were
only
cooling
ourselves
stammered
bumble
looking
apprehensively
about
him
yourselves
retorted
monks
all
the
rain
that
ever
fell
or
ever
will
fall
will
put
as
much
of
hell
fire
out
as
a
man
can
carry
about
with
him
you
wo
cool
yourself
so
easily
think
it
with
this
agreeable
speech
monks
turned
short
upon
the
matron
and
bent
his
gaze
upon
her
till
even
she
who
was
not
easily
cowed
was
fain
to
withdraw
her
eyes
and
turn
them
towards
the
ground
is
the
woman
is
it
demanded
monks
that
is
the
woman
replied
bumble
mindful
of
his
caution
think
women
never
can
keep
secrets
i
suppose
said
the
matron
interposing
and
returning
as
she
spoke
the
searching
look
of
monks
know
they
will
always
keep
till
it
found
out
said
monks
what
may
that
be
asked
the
matron
loss
of
their
own
good
name
replied
monks
by
the
same
rule
if
a
woman
a
party
to
a
secret
that
might
hang
or
transport
her
i
not
afraid
of
her
telling
it
to
anybody
not
i
do
you
understand
mistress
rejoined
the
matron
slightly
colouring
as
she
spoke
course
you
do
said
monks
should
you
bestowing
something
between
a
smile
and
a
frown
upon
his
two
companions
and
again
beckoning
them
to
follow
him
the
man
hastened
across
the
apartment
which
was
of
considerable
extent
but
low
in
the
roof
he
was
preparing
to
ascend
a
steep
staircase
or
rather
ladder
leading
to
another
floor
of
warehouses
above
when
a
bright
flash
of
lightning
streamed
down
the
aperture
and
a
peal
of
thunder
followed
which
shook
the
crazy
building
to
its
centre
it
he
cried
shrinking
back
it
rolling
and
crashing
on
as
if
it
echoed
through
a
thousand
caverns
where
the
devils
were
hiding
from
it
i
hate
the
sound
he
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
removing
his
hands
suddenly
from
his
face
showed
to
the
unspeakable
discomposure
of
bumble
that
it
was
much
distorted
and
discoloured
fits
come
over
me
now
and
then
said
monks
observing
his
alarm
thunder
sometimes
brings
them
on
do
mind
me
now
all
over
for
this
once
thus
speaking
he
led
the
way
up
the
ladder
and
hastily
closing
the
of
the
room
into
which
it
led
lowered
a
lantern
which
hung
at
the
end
of
a
rope
and
pulley
passed
through
one
of
the
heavy
beams
in
the
ceiling
and
which
cast
a
dim
light
upon
an
old
table
and
three
chairs
that
were
placed
beneath
it
said
monks
when
they
had
all
three
seated
themselves
sooner
we
come
to
our
business
the
better
for
all
the
woman
know
what
it
is
does
she
the
question
was
addressed
to
bumble
but
his
wife
anticipated
the
reply
by
intimating
that
she
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
it
is
right
in
saying
that
you
were
with
this
hag
the
night
she
died
and
that
she
told
you
something
the
mother
of
the
boy
you
named
replied
the
matron
interrupting
him
first
question
is
of
what
nature
was
her
communication
said
monks
the
second
observed
the
woman
with
much
deliberation
first
is
what
may
the
communication
be
worth
the
devil
can
tell
that
without
knowing
of
what
kind
it
is
asked
monks
better
than
you
i
am
persuaded
answered
bumble
who
did
not
want
for
spirit
as
her
could
abundantly
testify
said
monks
significantly
and
with
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
may
be
money
worth
to
get
eh
there
may
was
the
composed
reply
that
was
taken
from
her
said
monks
that
she
wore
something
that
had
better
bid
interrupted
bumble
have
heard
enough
already
to
assure
me
that
you
are
the
man
i
ought
to
talk
to
bumble
who
had
not
yet
been
admitted
by
his
better
half
into
any
greater
share
of
the
secret
than
he
had
originally
possessed
listened
to
this
dialogue
with
outstretched
neck
and
distended
eyes
which
he
directed
towards
his
wife
and
monks
by
turns
in
undisguised
astonishment
increased
if
possible
when
the
latter
sternly
demanded
what
sum
was
required
for
the
disclosure
it
worth
to
you
asked
the
woman
as
collectedly
as
before
may
be
nothing
it
may
be
twenty
pounds
replied
monks
out
and
let
me
know
which
five
pounds
to
the
sum
you
have
named
give
me
pounds
in
gold
said
the
woman
i
tell
you
all
i
know
not
before
pounds
exclaimed
monks
drawing
back
spoke
as
plainly
as
i
could
replied
bumble
not
a
large
sum
either
a
large
sum
for
a
paltry
secret
that
may
be
nothing
when
told
cried
monks
impatiently
which
has
been
lying
dead
for
twelve
years
past
or
more
matters
keep
well
and
like
good
wine
often
double
their
value
in
course
of
time
answered
the
matron
still
preserving
the
resolute
indifference
she
had
assumed
to
lying
dead
there
are
those
who
will
lie
dead
for
twelve
thousand
years
to
come
or
twelve
million
for
anything
you
or
i
know
who
will
tell
strange
tales
at
last
if
i
pay
it
for
nothing
asked
monks
hesitating
can
easily
take
it
away
again
replied
the
matron
am
but
a
woman
alone
here
and
unprotected
alone
my
dear
nor
unprotected
neither
submitted
bumble
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
fear
am
here
my
dear
and
besides
said
bumble
his
teeth
chattering
as
he
spoke
monks
is
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
attempt
any
violence
on
porochial
persons
monks
is
aware
that
i
am
not
a
young
man
my
dear
and
also
that
i
am
a
little
run
to
seed
as
i
may
say
bu
he
has
heerd
i
say
i
have
no
doubt
monks
has
heerd
my
dear
that
i
am
a
very
determined
officer
with
very
uncommon
strength
if
i
once
roused
i
only
want
a
little
rousing
that
all
as
bumble
spoke
he
made
a
melancholy
feint
of
grasping
his
lantern
with
fierce
determination
and
plainly
showed
by
the
alarmed
expression
of
every
feature
that
he
want
a
little
rousing
and
not
a
little
prior
to
making
any
very
warlike
demonstration
unless
indeed
against
paupers
or
other
person
or
persons
trained
down
for
the
purpose
are
a
fool
said
bumble
in
reply
had
better
hold
your
tongue
had
better
have
cut
it
out
before
he
came
if
he
ca
speak
in
a
lower
tone
said
monks
grimly
he
your
husband
eh
my
husband
tittered
the
matron
parrying
the
question
thought
as
much
when
you
came
in
rejoined
monks
marking
the
angry
glance
which
the
lady
darted
at
her
spouse
as
she
spoke
much
the
better
i
have
less
hesitation
in
dealing
with
two
people
when
i
find
that
there
only
one
will
between
them
i
in
earnest
see
here
he
thrust
his
hand
into
a
and
producing
a
canvas
bag
told
out
sovereigns
on
the
table
and
pushed
them
over
to
the
woman
he
said
them
up
and
when
this
cursed
peal
of
thunder
which
i
feel
is
coming
up
to
break
over
the
is
gone
hear
your
story
the
thunder
which
seemed
in
fact
much
nearer
and
to
shiver
and
break
almost
over
their
heads
having
subsided
monks
raising
his
face
from
the
table
bent
forward
to
listen
to
what
the
woman
should
say
the
faces
of
the
three
nearly
touched
as
the
two
men
leant
over
the
small
table
in
their
eagerness
to
hear
and
the
woman
also
leant
forward
to
render
her
whisper
audible
the
sickly
rays
of
the
suspended
lantern
falling
directly
upon
them
aggravated
the
paleness
and
anxiety
of
their
countenances
which
encircled
by
the
deepest
gloom
and
darkness
looked
ghastly
in
the
extreme
this
woman
that
we
called
old
sally
died
the
matron
began
and
i
were
alone
there
no
one
by
asked
monks
in
the
same
hollow
whisper
sick
wretch
or
idiot
in
some
other
bed
no
one
who
could
hear
and
might
by
possibility
understand
a
soul
replied
the
woman
were
alone
stood
alone
beside
the
body
when
death
came
over
it
said
monks
regarding
her
attentively
on
spoke
of
a
young
creature
resumed
the
matron
had
brought
a
child
into
the
world
some
years
before
not
merely
in
the
same
room
but
in
the
same
bed
in
which
she
then
lay
dying
said
monks
with
quivering
lip
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
how
things
come
about
child
was
the
one
you
named
to
him
last
night
said
the
matron
nodding
carelessly
towards
her
husband
mother
this
nurse
had
robbed
life
asked
monks
death
replied
the
woman
with
something
like
a
shudder
stole
from
the
corpse
when
it
had
hardly
turned
to
one
that
which
the
dead
mother
had
prayed
her
with
her
last
breath
to
keep
for
the
infant
sake
sold
it
cried
monks
with
desperate
eagerness
she
sell
it
where
when
to
whom
how
long
before
she
told
me
with
great
difficulty
that
she
had
done
this
said
the
matron
fell
back
and
died
saying
more
cried
monks
in
a
voice
which
from
its
very
suppression
seemed
only
the
more
furious
a
lie
i
not
be
played
with
she
said
more
i
tear
the
life
out
of
you
both
but
i
know
what
it
was
did
utter
another
word
said
the
woman
to
all
appearance
unmoved
as
bumble
was
very
far
from
being
by
the
strange
violence
she
clutched
my
gown
violently
with
one
hand
which
was
partly
closed
and
when
i
saw
that
she
was
dead
and
so
removed
the
hand
by
force
i
found
it
clasped
a
scrap
of
dirty
paper
contained
interposed
monks
stretching
forward
replied
the
woman
was
a
pawnbroker
duplicate
what
demanded
monks
good
time
i
tell
you
said
the
woman
judge
that
she
had
kept
the
trinket
for
some
time
in
the
hope
of
turning
it
to
better
account
and
then
had
pawned
it
and
had
saved
or
scraped
together
money
to
pay
the
pawnbroker
interest
year
by
year
and
prevent
its
running
out
so
that
if
anything
came
of
it
it
could
still
be
redeemed
nothing
had
come
of
it
and
as
i
tell
you
she
died
with
the
scrap
of
paper
all
worn
and
tattered
in
her
hand
the
time
was
out
in
two
days
i
thought
something
might
one
day
come
of
it
too
and
so
redeemed
the
pledge
is
it
now
asked
monks
quickly
replied
the
woman
and
as
if
glad
to
be
relieved
of
it
she
hastily
threw
upon
the
table
a
small
kid
bag
scarcely
large
enough
for
a
french
watch
which
monks
pouncing
upon
tore
open
with
trembling
hands
it
contained
a
little
gold
locket
in
which
were
two
locks
of
hair
and
a
plain
gold
has
the
word
agnes
engraved
on
the
inside
said
the
woman
is
a
blank
left
for
the
surname
and
then
follows
the
date
which
is
within
a
year
before
the
child
was
born
i
found
out
that
this
is
all
said
monks
after
a
close
and
eager
scrutiny
of
the
contents
of
the
little
packet
replied
the
woman
bumble
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
he
were
glad
to
find
that
the
story
was
over
and
no
mention
made
of
taking
the
pounds
back
again
and
now
he
took
courage
to
wipe
the
perspiration
which
had
been
trickling
over
his
nose
unchecked
during
the
whole
of
the
previous
dialogue
know
nothing
of
the
story
beyond
what
i
can
guess
at
said
his
wife
addressing
monks
after
a
short
silence
i
want
to
know
nothing
for
it
safer
not
but
i
may
ask
you
two
questions
may
i
may
ask
said
monks
with
some
show
of
surprise
whether
i
answer
or
not
is
another
question
which
makes
three
observed
bumble
essaying
a
stroke
of
facetiousness
that
what
you
expected
to
get
from
me
demanded
the
matron
is
replied
monks
other
question
do
you
propose
to
do
with
it
can
it
be
used
against
me
rejoined
monks
against
me
either
see
here
but
move
a
step
forward
or
your
life
is
not
worth
a
bulrush
with
these
words
he
suddenly
wheeled
the
table
aside
and
pulling
an
iron
ring
in
the
boarding
threw
back
a
large
which
opened
close
at
bumble
feet
and
caused
that
gentleman
to
retire
several
paces
backward
with
great
precipitation
down
said
monks
lowering
the
lantern
into
the
gulf
fear
me
i
could
have
let
you
down
quietly
enough
when
you
were
seated
over
it
if
that
had
been
my
game
thus
encouraged
the
matron
drew
near
to
the
brink
and
even
bumble
himself
impelled
by
curiousity
ventured
to
do
the
same
the
turbid
water
swollen
by
the
heavy
rain
was
rushing
rapidly
on
below
and
all
other
sounds
were
lost
in
the
noise
of
its
plashing
and
eddying
against
the
green
and
slimy
piles
there
had
once
been
a
beneath
the
tide
foaming
and
chafing
round
the
few
rotten
stakes
and
fragments
of
machinery
that
yet
remained
seemed
to
dart
onward
with
a
new
impulse
when
freed
from
the
obstacles
which
had
unavailingly
attempted
to
stem
its
headlong
course
you
flung
a
man
body
down
there
where
would
it
be
morning
said
monks
swinging
the
lantern
to
and
fro
in
the
dark
well
miles
down
the
river
and
cut
to
pieces
besides
replied
bumble
recoiling
at
the
thought
monks
drew
the
little
packet
from
his
breast
where
he
had
hurriedly
thrust
it
and
tying
it
to
a
leaden
weight
which
had
formed
a
part
of
some
pulley
and
was
lying
on
the
floor
dropped
it
into
the
stream
it
fell
straight
and
true
as
a
die
clove
the
water
with
a
scarcely
audible
splash
and
was
gone
the
three
looking
into
each
other
faces
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
said
monks
closing
the
which
fell
heavily
back
into
its
former
position
the
sea
ever
gives
up
its
dead
as
books
say
it
will
it
will
keep
its
gold
and
silver
to
itself
and
that
trash
among
it
we
have
nothing
more
to
say
and
may
break
up
our
pleasant
party
all
means
observed
bumble
with
great
alacrity
keep
a
quiet
tongue
in
your
head
will
you
said
monks
with
a
threatening
look
am
not
afraid
of
your
wife
may
depend
upon
me
young
man
answered
bumble
bowing
himself
gradually
towards
the
ladder
with
excessive
politeness
everybody
account
young
man
on
my
own
you
know
mr
monks
am
glad
for
your
sake
to
hear
it
remarked
monks
your
lantern
and
get
away
from
here
as
fast
as
you
can
it
was
fortunate
that
the
conversation
terminated
at
this
point
or
bumble
who
had
bowed
himself
to
within
six
inches
of
the
ladder
would
infallibly
have
pitched
headlong
into
the
room
below
he
lighted
his
lantern
from
that
which
monks
had
detached
from
the
rope
and
now
carried
in
his
hand
and
making
no
effort
to
prolong
the
discourse
descended
in
silence
followed
by
his
wife
monks
brought
up
the
rear
after
pausing
on
the
steps
to
satisfy
himself
that
there
were
no
other
sounds
to
be
heard
than
the
beating
of
the
rain
without
and
the
rushing
of
the
water
they
traversed
the
lower
room
slowly
and
with
caution
for
monks
started
at
every
shadow
and
bumble
holding
his
lantern
a
foot
above
the
ground
walked
not
only
with
remarkable
care
but
with
a
marvellously
light
step
for
a
gentleman
of
his
figure
looking
nervously
about
him
for
hidden
the
gate
at
which
they
had
entered
was
softly
unfastened
and
opened
by
monks
merely
exchanging
a
nod
with
their
mysterious
acquaintance
the
married
couple
emerged
into
the
wet
and
darkness
outside
they
were
no
sooner
gone
than
monks
who
appeared
to
entertain
an
invincible
repugnance
to
being
left
alone
called
to
a
boy
who
had
been
hidden
somewhere
below
bidding
him
go
first
and
bear
the
light
he
returned
to
the
chamber
he
had
just
quitted
chapter
xxxix
introduces
some
respectable
characters
with
whom
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
and
shows
how
monks
and
the
jew
laid
their
worthy
heads
together
on
the
evening
following
that
upon
which
the
three
worthies
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
disposed
of
their
little
matter
of
business
as
therein
narrated
william
sikes
awakening
from
a
nap
drowsily
growled
forth
an
inquiry
what
time
of
night
it
was
the
room
in
which
sikes
propounded
this
question
was
not
one
of
those
he
had
tenanted
previous
to
the
chertsey
expedition
although
it
was
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
town
and
was
situated
at
no
great
distance
from
his
former
lodgings
it
was
not
in
appearance
so
desirable
a
habitation
as
his
old
quarters
being
a
mean
and
apartment
of
very
limited
size
lighted
only
by
one
small
window
in
the
shelving
roof
and
abutting
on
a
close
and
dirty
lane
nor
were
there
wanting
other
indications
of
the
good
having
gone
down
in
the
world
of
late
for
a
great
scarcity
of
furniture
and
total
absence
of
comfort
together
with
the
disappearance
of
all
such
small
moveables
as
spare
clothes
and
linen
bespoke
a
state
of
extreme
poverty
while
the
meagre
and
attenuated
condition
of
sikes
himself
would
have
fully
confirmed
these
symptoms
if
they
had
stood
in
any
need
of
corroboration
the
housebreaker
was
lying
on
the
bed
wrapped
in
his
white
by
way
of
and
displaying
a
set
of
features
in
no
degree
improved
by
the
cadaverous
hue
of
illness
and
the
addition
of
a
soiled
nightcap
and
a
stiff
black
beard
of
a
week
growth
the
dog
sat
at
the
bedside
now
eyeing
his
master
with
a
wistful
look
and
now
pricking
his
ears
and
uttering
a
low
growl
as
some
noise
in
the
street
or
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
attracted
his
attention
seated
by
the
window
busily
engaged
in
patching
an
old
waistcoat
which
formed
a
portion
of
the
robber
ordinary
dress
was
a
female
so
pale
and
reduced
with
watching
and
privation
that
there
would
have
been
considerable
difficulty
in
recognising
her
as
the
same
nancy
who
has
already
figured
in
this
tale
but
for
the
voice
in
which
she
replied
to
sikes
question
long
gone
seven
said
the
girl
do
you
feel
bill
weak
as
water
replied
sikes
with
an
imprecation
on
his
eyes
and
limbs
lend
us
a
hand
and
let
me
get
off
this
thundering
bed
anyhow
illness
had
not
improved
sikes
temper
for
as
the
girl
raised
him
up
and
led
him
to
a
chair
he
muttered
various
curses
on
her
awkwardness
and
struck
her
are
you
said
sikes
do
stand
snivelling
there
if
you
ca
do
anything
better
than
that
cut
off
altogether
d
hear
me
hear
you
replied
the
girl
turning
her
face
aside
and
forcing
a
laugh
fancy
have
you
got
in
your
head
now
you
thought
better
of
it
have
you
growled
sikes
marking
the
tear
which
trembled
in
her
eye
the
better
for
you
you
have
you
do
mean
to
say
you
be
hard
upon
me
bill
said
the
girl
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
cried
sikes
not
a
number
of
nights
said
the
girl
with
a
touch
of
tenderness
which
communicated
something
like
sweetness
of
tone
even
to
her
voice
a
number
of
nights
as
i
been
patient
with
you
nursing
and
caring
for
you
as
if
you
had
been
a
child
and
this
the
first
that
i
seen
you
like
yourself
you
would
have
served
me
as
you
did
just
now
if
you
thought
of
that
would
you
come
come
say
you
would
then
rejoined
sikes
would
why
damme
now
the
girls
whining
again
nothing
said
the
girl
throwing
herself
into
a
chair
you
seem
to
mind
me
it
soon
be
over
be
over
demanded
sikes
in
a
savage
voice
foolery
are
you
up
to
now
again
get
up
and
bustle
about
and
do
come
over
me
with
your
woman
nonsense
at
any
other
time
this
remonstrance
and
the
tone
in
which
it
was
delivered
would
have
had
the
desired
effect
but
the
girl
being
really
weak
and
exhausted
dropped
her
head
over
the
back
of
the
chair
and
fainted
before
sikes
could
get
out
a
few
of
the
appropriate
oaths
with
which
on
similar
occasions
he
was
accustomed
to
garnish
his
threats
not
knowing
very
well
what
to
do
in
this
uncommon
emergency
for
miss
nancy
hysterics
were
usually
of
that
violent
kind
which
the
patient
fights
and
struggles
out
of
without
much
assistance
sikes
tried
a
little
blasphemy
and
finding
that
mode
of
treatment
wholly
ineffectual
called
for
assistance
the
matter
here
my
dear
said
fagin
looking
in
a
hand
to
the
girl
ca
you
replied
sikes
impatiently
stand
chattering
and
grinning
at
me
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
fagin
hastened
to
the
assistance
while
john
dawkins
otherwise
the
artful
dodger
who
had
followed
his
venerable
friend
into
the
room
hastily
deposited
on
the
floor
a
bundle
with
which
he
was
laden
and
snatching
a
bottle
from
the
grasp
of
master
charles
bates
who
came
close
at
his
heels
uncorked
it
in
a
twinkling
with
his
teeth
and
poured
a
portion
of
its
contents
down
the
patient
throat
previously
taking
a
taste
himself
to
prevent
mistakes

whiff
of
fresh
air

the
bellows

slap
her
hands

while
bill
undoes
the
petticuts
these
united
restoratives
administered
with
great
energy
especially
that
department
consigned
to
master
bates
who
appeared
to
consider
his
share
in
the
proceedings
a
piece
of
unexampled
pleasantry
were
not
long
in
producing
the
desired
effect
the
girl
gradually
recovered
her
senses
and
staggering
to
a
chair
by
the
bedside
hid
her
face
upon
the
pillow
leaving
sikes
to
confront
the
new
comers
in
some
astonishment
at
their
appearance
what
evil
wind
has
blowed
you
here
he
asked
fagin
evil
wind
at
all
my
dear
for
evil
winds

nobody
any
good
and
i
brought
something
good
with
me
that
you
be
glad
to
see
dodger
my
dear
open
the
bundle
and
give
bill
the
little
trifles
that
we
spent
all
our
money
on
this
morning
in
compliance
with
fagin
request
the
artful
untied
this
bundle
which
was
of
large
size
and
formed
of
an
old
and
handed
the
articles
it
contained
one
by
one
to
charley
bates
who
placed
them
on
the
table
with
various
encomiums
on
their
rarity
and
excellence
a
rabbit
pie

exclaimed
that
young
gentleman
disclosing
to

a
huge
pasty
delicate

with
sitch
tender
limbs
bill
that
the
wery
bones
melt
in
your
mouth
and
there

precious

if

with

to
blow
the
lid
of

a
half
of

of

ever
lushed
uttering
this
last
panegyric
master
bates
produced
from
one
of
his
extensive
pockets
a
carefully
corked
while
dawkins
at
the
same
instant
poured
out
a
of
raw
spirits
from
the
bottle
he
carried
which
the
invalid
tossed
down
his
throat
without
a
moment
hesitation
said
fagin
rubbing
his
hands
with
great
satisfaction

exclaimed
sikes

for
twenty
times
over
afore

fagin
shrugging
his
shoulders

to
bring

all
these
things
things
is
well
enough
in
their
way
observed
sikes
a
little
soothed
as
he
glanced
over
the
table
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
why
you
should
leave
me
here
down
in
the
mouth
health
blunt
and
everything
else
and
take
no
more
notice
of

all
this
mortal
time
than

make
his
fortun
on
the
stage
that
dog
would
and
rewive
the
drayma
besides
your
din
cried
sikes
as
the
dog
retreated
under
the
bed
still
growling
angrily

you
got
to
say
for
yourself
you
withered
old
fence
eh
was
away
from
london
a
week
and
more
my
dear
on
a
plant
replied
the
jew
what
about
the
other
fortnight
demanded
sikes
about
the
other
fortnight
that
you
left
me
lying
here
like
a
sick
rat
in
his
hole
could
help
it
bill
i
ca
go
into
a
long
explanation
before
company
but
i
could
help
it
upon
my
honour
your
what
growled
sikes
with
excessive
disgust
cut
me
off
a
piece
of
that
pie
one
of
you
boys
to
take
the
taste
of
that
out
of
my
mouth
or

out
of

my
dear
urged
fagin
submissively
have
never
forgot
you
bill
never
once
i
pound
it
that
you
ha
replied
sikes
with
a
bitter
grin
been
scheming
and
plotting
away
every
hour
that
i
have
laid
shivering
and
burning
here
and
bill
was
to
do
this
and
bill
was
to
do
that
and
bill
was
to
do
it
all
dirt
cheap
as
soon
as
he
got
well
and
was
quite
poor
enough
for
your
work
if
it
had
been
for
the
girl
i
might
have
died
now
bill
remonstrated
fagin
eagerly
catching
at
the
word
it
had
been
for
the
girl
who
but
poor
ould
fagin
was
the
means
of
your
having
such
a
handy
girl
about
you
says
true
enough
there
said
nancy
coming
hastily
forward
him

let
him
be
nancy
appearance
gave
a
new
turn
to
the
conversation
for
the
boys
receiving
a
sly
wink
from
the
wary
old
jew
began
to
ply
her
with
liquor
of
which
however
she
took
very
sparingly
while
fagin
assuming
an
unusual
flow
of
spirits
gradually
brought
sikes
into
a
better
temper
by
affecting
to
regard
his
threats
as
a
little
pleasant
banter
and
moreover
by
laughing
very
heartily
at
one
or
two
rough
jokes
which
after
repeated
applications
to
the
he
condescended
to
make
all
very
well
said
sikes
i
must
have
some
blunt
from
you
have
a
piece
of
coin
about
me
replied
the
jew
you
got
lots
at
home
retorted
sikes
i
must
have
some
from
there
cried
fagin
holding
up
is
hands
have
so
much
as
would
do
know
how
much
you
got
and
i
dare
say
you
hardly
know
yourself
as
it
would
take
a
pretty
long
time
to
count
it
said
sikes
i
must
have
some
and
that
flat
well
said
fagin
with
a
sigh
send
the
artful
round
presently
wo
do
nothing
of
the
kind
rejoined
sikes
artful
a
deal
too
artful
and
would
forget
to
come
or
lose
his
way
or
get
dodged
by
traps
and
so
be
perwented
or
anything
for
an
excuse
if
you
put
him
up
to
it
nancy
shall
go
to
the
ken
and
fetch
it
to
make
all
sure
and
i
lie
down
and
have
a
snooze
while
she
gone
after
a
great
deal
of
haggling
and
squabbling
fagin
beat
down
the
amount
of
the
required
advance
from
five
pounds
to
three
pounds
four
and
sixpence
protesting
with
many
solemn
asseverations
that
that
would
only
leave
him
to
keep
house
with
sikes
sullenly
remarking
that
if
he
could
get
any
more
he
must
accompany
him
home
with
the
dodger
and
master
bates
put
the
eatables
in
the
cupboard
the
jew
then
taking
leave
of
his
affectionate
friend
returned
homeward
attended
by
nancy
and
the
boys
sikes
meanwhile
flinging
himself
on
the
bed
and
composing
himself
to
sleep
away
the
time
until
the
young
lady
return
in
due
course
they
arrived
at
fagin
abode
where
they
found
toby
crackit
and
chitling
intent
upon
their
fifteenth
game
at
cribbage
which
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
the
latter
gentleman
lost
and
with
it
his
fifteenth
and
last
sixpence
much
to
the
amusement
of
his
young
friends
crackit
apparently
somewhat
ashamed
at
being
found
relaxing
himself
with
a
gentleman
so
much
his
inferior
in
station
and
mental
endowments
yawned
and
inquiring
after
sikes
took
up
his
hat
to
go
nobody
been
toby
asked
fagin
a
living
leg
answered
crackit
pulling
up
his
collar
been
as
dull
as
swipes
you
ought
to
stand
something
handsome
fagin
to
recompense
me
for
keeping
house
so
long
damme
i
as
flat
as
a
juryman
and
should
have
gone
to
sleep
as
fast
as
newgate
if
i
had
the
good
natur
to
amuse
this
youngster
horrid
dull
i
blessed
if
i
a
with
these
and
other
ejaculations
of
the
same
kind
toby
crackit
swept
up
his
winnings
and
crammed
them
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
with
a
haughty
air
as
though
such
small
pieces
of
silver
were
wholly
beneath
the
consideration
of
a
man
of
his
figure
this
done
he
swaggered
out
of
the
room
with
so
much
elegance
and
gentility
that
chitling
bestowing
numerous
admiring
glances
on
his
legs
and
boots
till
they
were
out
of
sight
assured
the
company
that
he
considered
his
acquaintance
cheap
at
fifteen
sixpences
an
interview
and
that
he
did
value
his
losses
the
snap
of
his
little
finger
a
rum
chap
you
are
tom
said
master
bates
highly
amused
by
this
declaration
a
bit
of
it
replied
chitling
i
fagin
very
clever
fellow
my
dear
said
fagin
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
and
winking
to
his
other
pupils
crackit
is
a
heavy
swell
a
he
fagin
asked
tom
doubt
at
all
of
that
my
dear
it
is
a
creditable
thing
to
have
his
acquaintance
a
it
fagin
pursued
tom
much
so
indeed
my
dear
they
only
jealous
tom
because
he
wo
give
it
to
them
cried
tom
triumphantly
where
it
is
he
has
cleaned
me
out
but
i
can
go
and
earn
some
more
when
i
like
ca
i
fagin
be
sure
you
can
and
the
sooner
you
go
the
better
tom
so
make
up
your
loss
at
once
and
do
lose
any
more
time
dodger
charley
it
time
you
were
on
the
lay
come
it
near
ten
and
nothing
done
yet
in
obedience
to
this
hint
the
boys
nodding
to
nancy
took
up
their
hats
and
left
the
room
the
dodger
and
his
vivacious
friend
indulging
as
they
went
in
many
witticisms
at
the
expense
of
chitling
in
whose
conduct
it
is
but
justice
to
say
there
was
nothing
very
conspicuous
or
peculiar
inasmuch
as
there
are
a
great
number
of
spirited
young
bloods
upon
town
who
pay
a
much
higher
price
than
chitling
for
being
seen
in
good
society
and
a
great
number
of
fine
gentlemen
composing
the
good
society
aforesaid
who
established
their
reputation
upon
very
much
the
same
footing
as
flash
toby
crackit
said
fagin
when
they
had
left
the
room
go
and
get
you
that
cash
nancy
this
is
only
the
key
of
a
little
cupboard
where
i
keep
a
few
odd
things
the
boys
get
my
dear
i
never
lock
up
my
money
for
i
got
none
to
lock
up
my
dear
ha
ha
ha
none
to
lock
up
it
a
poor
trade
nancy
and
no
thanks
but
i
fond
of
seeing
the
young
people
about
me
and
i
bear
it
all
i
bear
it
all
hush
he
said
hastily
concealing
the
key
in
his
breast
that
listen
the
girl
who
was
sitting
at
the
table
with
her
arms
folded
appeared
in
no
way
interested
in
the
arrival
or
to
care
whether
the
person
whoever
he
was
came
or
went
until
the
murmur
of
a
man
voice
reached
her
ears
the
instant
she
caught
the
sound
she
tore
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
and
thrust
them
under
the
table
the
jew
turning
round
immediately
afterwards
she
muttered
a
complaint
of
the
heat
in
a
tone
of
languor
that
contrasted
very
remarkably
with
the
extreme
haste
and
violence
of
this
action
which
however
had
been
unobserved
by
fagin
who
had
his
back
towards
her
at
the
time
he
whispered
as
though
nettled
by
the
interruption
the
man
i
expected
before
he
coming
downstairs
not
a
word
about
the
money
while
he
here
nance
he
wo
stop
long
not
ten
minutes
my
dear
laying
his
skinny
forefinger
upon
his
lip
the
jew
carried
a
candle
to
the
door
as
a
man
step
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
without
he
reached
it
at
the
same
moment
as
the
visitor
who
coming
hastily
into
the
room
was
close
upon
the
girl
before
he
observed
her
it
was
monks
one
of
my
young
people
said
fagin
observing
that
monks
drew
back
on
beholding
a
stranger
move
nancy
the
girl
drew
closer
to
the
table
and
glancing
at
monks
with
an
air
of
careless
levity
withdrew
her
eyes
but
as
he
turned
towards
fagin
she
stole
another
look
so
keen
and
searching
and
full
of
purpose
that
if
there
had
been
any
bystander
to
observe
the
change
he
could
hardly
have
believed
the
two
looks
to
have
proceeded
from
the
same
person
news
inquired
fagin
and
good
asked
fagin
hesitating
as
though
he
feared
to
vex
the
other
man
by
being
too
sanguine
bad
any
way
replied
monks
with
a
smile
have
been
prompt
enough
this
time
let
me
have
a
word
with
you
the
girl
drew
closer
to
the
table
and
made
no
offer
to
leave
the
room
although
she
could
see
that
monks
was
pointing
to
her
the
jew
perhaps
fearing
she
might
say
something
aloud
about
the
money
if
he
endeavoured
to
get
rid
of
her
pointed
upward
and
took
monks
out
of
the
room
that
infernal
hole
we
were
in
before
she
could
hear
the
man
say
as
they
went
upstairs
fagin
laughed
and
making
some
reply
which
did
not
reach
her
seemed
by
the
creaking
of
the
boards
to
lead
his
companion
to
the
second
story
before
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
had
ceased
to
echo
through
the
house
the
girl
had
slipped
off
her
shoes
and
drawing
her
gown
loosely
over
her
head
and
muffling
her
arms
in
it
stood
at
the
door
listening
with
breathless
interest
the
moment
the
noise
ceased
she
glided
from
the
room
ascended
the
stairs
with
incredible
softness
and
silence
and
was
lost
in
the
gloom
above
the
room
remained
deserted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
the
girl
glided
back
with
the
same
unearthly
tread
and
immediately
afterwards
the
two
men
were
heard
descending
monks
went
at
once
into
the
street
and
the
jew
crawled
upstairs
again
for
the
money
when
he
returned
the
girl
was
adjusting
her
shawl
and
bonnet
as
if
preparing
to
be
gone
nance
exclaimed
the
jew
starting
back
as
he
put
down
the
candle
pale
you
are
echoed
the
girl
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hands
as
if
to
look
steadily
at
him
horrible
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
that
i
know
of
except
sitting
in
this
close
place
for
i
know
how
long
and
all
replied
the
girl
carelessly
let
me
get
back
that
a
dear
with
a
sigh
for
every
piece
of
money
fagin
told
the
amount
into
her
hand
they
parted
without
more
conversation
merely
interchanging
a
when
the
girl
got
into
the
open
street
she
sat
down
upon
a
doorstep
and
seemed
for
a
few
moments
wholly
bewildered
and
unable
to
pursue
her
way
suddenly
she
arose
and
hurrying
on
in
a
direction
quite
opposite
to
that
in
which
sikes
was
awaiting
her
returned
quickened
her
pace
until
it
gradually
resolved
into
a
violent
run
after
completely
exhausting
herself
she
stopped
to
take
breath
and
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
herself
and
deploring
her
inability
to
do
something
she
was
bent
upon
wrung
her
hands
and
burst
into
tears
it
might
be
that
her
tears
relieved
her
or
that
she
felt
the
full
hopelessness
of
her
condition
but
she
turned
back
and
hurrying
with
nearly
as
great
rapidity
in
the
contrary
direction
partly
to
recover
lost
time
and
partly
to
keep
pace
with
the
violent
current
of
her
own
thoughts
soon
reached
the
dwelling
where
she
had
left
the
housebreaker
if
she
betrayed
any
agitation
when
she
presented
herself
to
sikes
he
did
not
observe
it
for
merely
inquiring
if
she
had
brought
the
money
and
receiving
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
he
uttered
a
growl
of
satisfaction
and
replacing
his
head
upon
the
pillow
resumed
the
slumbers
which
her
arrival
had
interrupted
it
was
fortunate
for
her
that
the
possession
of
money
occasioned
him
so
much
employment
next
day
in
the
way
of
eating
and
drinking
and
withal
had
so
beneficial
an
effect
in
smoothing
down
the
asperities
of
his
temper
that
he
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
be
very
critical
upon
her
behaviour
and
deportment
that
she
had
all
the
abstracted
and
nervous
manner
of
one
who
is
on
the
eve
of
some
bold
and
hazardous
step
which
it
has
required
no
common
struggle
to
resolve
upon
would
have
been
obvious
to
the
fagin
who
would
most
probably
have
taken
the
alarm
at
once
but
sikes
lacking
the
niceties
of
discrimination
and
being
troubled
with
no
more
subtle
misgivings
than
those
which
resolve
themselves
into
a
dogged
roughness
of
behaviour
towards
everybody
and
being
furthermore
in
an
unusually
amiable
condition
as
has
been
already
observed
saw
nothing
unusual
in
her
demeanor
and
indeed
troubled
himself
so
little
about
her
that
had
her
agitation
been
far
more
perceptible
than
it
was
it
would
have
been
very
unlikely
to
have
awakened
his
suspicions
as
that
day
closed
in
the
girl
excitement
increased
and
when
night
came
on
and
she
sat
by
watching
until
the
housebreaker
should
drink
himself
asleep
there
was
an
unusual
paleness
in
her
cheek
and
a
fire
in
her
eye
that
even
sikes
observed
with
astonishment
sikes
being
weak
from
the
fever
was
lying
in
bed
taking
hot
water
with
his
gin
to
render
it
less
inflammatory
and
had
pushed
his
glass
towards
nancy
to
be
replenished
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
when
these
symptoms
first
struck
him
burn
my
body
said
the
man
raising
himself
on
his
hands
as
he
stared
the
girl
in
the
face
look
like
a
corpse
come
to
life
again
what
the
matter
replied
the
girl
what
do
you
look
at
me
so
hard
for
foolery
is
this
demanded
sikes
grasping
her
by
the
arm
and
shaking
her
roughly
is
it
what
do
you
mean
what
are
you
thinking
of
many
things
bill
replied
the
girl
shivering
and
as
she
did
so
pressing
her
hands
upon
her
eyes
lord
what
odds
in
that
the
tone
of
forced
gaiety
in
which
the
last
words
were
spoken
seemed
to
produce
a
deeper
impression
on
sikes
than
the
wild
and
rigid
look
which
had
preceded
them
tell
you
wot
it
is
said
sikes
you
have
caught
the
fever
and
got
it
comin
on
now
there
something
more
than
usual
in
the
wind
and
something
dangerous
too
you
not
to
no
damme
you
would
do
that
what
asked
the
girl
ai
said
sikes
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
and
muttering
the
words
to
himself
ai
a
gal
going
or
have
cut
her
throat
three
months
ago
she
got
the
fever
coming
on
that
it
fortifying
himself
with
this
assurance
sikes
drained
the
glass
to
the
bottom
and
then
with
many
grumbling
oaths
called
for
his
physic
the
girl
jumped
up
with
great
alacrity
poured
it
quickly
out
but
with
her
back
towards
him
and
held
the
vessel
to
his
lips
while
he
drank
off
the
contents
said
the
robber
and
sit
aside
of
me
and
put
on
your
own
face
or
i
alter
it
so
that
you
wo
know
it
agin
when
you
do
want
it
the
girl
obeyed
sikes
locking
her
hand
in
his
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
turning
his
eyes
upon
her
face
they
closed
opened
again
closed
once
more
again
opened
he
shifted
his
position
restlessly
and
after
dozing
again
and
again
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
as
often
springing
up
with
a
look
of
terror
and
gazing
vacantly
about
him
was
suddenly
stricken
as
it
were
while
in
the
very
attitude
of
rising
into
a
deep
and
heavy
sleep
the
grasp
of
his
hand
relaxed
the
upraised
arm
fell
languidly
by
his
side
and
he
lay
like
one
in
a
profound
trance
laudanum
has
taken
effect
at
last
murmured
the
girl
as
she
rose
from
the
bedside
may
be
too
late
even
now
she
hastily
dressed
herself
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
looking
fearfully
round
from
time
to
time
as
if
despite
the
sleeping
draught
she
expected
every
moment
to
feel
the
pressure
of
sikes
heavy
hand
upon
her
shoulder
then
stooping
softly
over
the
bed
she
kissed
the
robber
lips
and
then
opening
and
closing
the
with
noiseless
touch
hurried
from
the
house
a
watchman
was
crying
nine
down
a
dark
passage
through
which
she
had
to
pass
in
gaining
the
main
thoroughfare
it
long
gone
the
asked
the
girl
strike
the
hour
in
another
quarter
said
the
man
raising
his
lantern
to
her
face
i
can
not
get
there
in
less
than
an
hour
or
more
muttered
nancy
brushing
swiftly
past
him
and
gliding
rapidly
down
the
street
many
of
the
shops
were
already
closing
in
the
back
lanes
and
avenues
through
which
she
tracked
her
way
in
making
from
spitalfields
towards
the
of
london
the
clock
struck
ten
increasing
her
impatience
she
tore
along
the
narrow
pavement
elbowing
the
passengers
from
side
to
side
and
darting
almost
under
the
heads
crossed
crowded
streets
where
clusters
of
persons
were
eagerly
watching
their
opportunity
to
do
the
like
woman
is
mad
said
the
people
turning
to
look
after
her
as
she
rushed
away
when
she
reached
the
more
wealthy
quarter
of
the
town
the
streets
were
comparatively
deserted
and
here
her
headlong
progress
excited
a
still
greater
curiosity
in
the
stragglers
whom
she
hurried
past
some
quickened
their
pace
behind
as
though
to
see
whither
she
was
hastening
at
such
an
unusual
rate
and
a
few
made
head
upon
her
and
looked
back
surprised
at
her
undiminished
speed
but
they
fell
off
one
by
one
and
when
she
neared
her
place
of
destination
she
was
alone
it
was
a
family
hotel
in
a
quiet
but
handsome
street
near
hyde
park
as
the
brilliant
light
of
the
lamp
which
burnt
before
its
door
guided
her
to
the
spot
the
clock
struck
eleven
she
had
loitered
for
a
few
paces
as
though
irresolute
and
making
up
her
mind
to
advance
but
the
sound
determined
her
and
she
stepped
into
the
hall
the
porter
seat
was
vacant
she
looked
round
with
an
air
of
incertitude
and
advanced
towards
the
stairs
young
woman
said
a
female
looking
out
from
a
door
behind
her
do
you
want
here
lady
who
is
stopping
in
this
house
answered
the
girl
lady
was
the
reply
accompanied
with
a
scornful
look
lady
maylie
said
nancy
the
young
woman
who
had
by
this
time
noted
her
appearance
replied
only
by
a
look
of
virtuous
disdain
and
summoned
a
man
to
answer
her
to
him
nancy
repeated
her
request
name
am
i
to
say
asked
the
waiter
of
no
use
saying
any
replied
nancy
business
said
the
man
nor
that
neither
rejoined
the
girl
must
see
the
lady
said
the
man
pushing
her
towards
the
door
of
this
take
yourself
off
shall
be
carried
out
if
i
go
said
the
girl
violently
i
can
make
that
a
job
that
two
of
you
wo
like
to
do
is
there
anybody
here
she
said
looking
round
will
see
a
simple
message
carried
for
a
poor
wretch
like
me
this
appeal
produced
an
effect
on
a
who
with
some
of
the
other
servants
was
looking
on
and
who
stepped
forward
to
interfere
it
up
for
her
joe
ca
you
said
this
person
the
good
replied
the
man
do
suppose
the
young
lady
will
see
such
as
her
do
you
this
allusion
to
nancy
doubtful
character
raised
a
vast
quantity
of
chaste
wrath
in
the
bosoms
of
four
housemaids
who
remarked
with
great
fervour
that
the
creature
was
a
disgrace
to
her
sex
and
strongly
advocated
her
being
thrown
ruthlessly
into
the
kennel
what
you
like
with
me
said
the
girl
turning
to
the
men
again
do
what
i
ask
you
first
and
i
ask
you
to
give
this
message
for
god
almighty
sake
the
cook
added
his
intercession
and
the
result
was
that
the
man
who
had
first
appeared
undertook
its
delivery
it
to
be
said
the
man
with
one
foot
on
the
stairs
a
young
woman
earnestly
asks
to
speak
to
miss
maylie
alone
said
nancy
that
if
the
lady
will
only
hear
the
first
word
she
has
to
say
she
will
know
whether
to
hear
her
business
or
to
have
her
turned
out
of
doors
as
an
impostor
say
said
the
man
coming
it
strong
give
the
message
said
the
girl
firmly
let
me
hear
the
answer
the
man
ran
upstairs
nancy
remained
pale
and
almost
breathless
listening
with
quivering
lip
to
the
very
audible
expressions
of
scorn
of
which
the
chaste
housemaids
were
very
prolific
and
of
which
they
became
still
more
so
when
the
man
returned
and
said
the
young
woman
was
to
walk
upstairs
no
good
being
proper
in
this
world
said
the
first
housemaid
can
do
better
than
the
gold
what
has
stood
the
fire
said
the
second
the
third
contented
herself
with
wondering
ladies
was
made
of
and
the
fourth
took
the
first
in
a
quartette
of
with
which
the
dianas
concluded
regardless
of
all
this
for
she
had
weightier
matters
at
heart
nancy
followed
the
man
with
trembling
limbs
to
a
small
lighted
by
a
lamp
from
the
ceiling
here
he
left
her
and
retired
chapter
xl
a
strange
interview
which
is
a
sequel
to
the
last
chamber
the
girl
life
had
been
squandered
in
the
streets
and
among
the
most
noisome
of
the
stews
and
dens
of
london
but
there
was
something
of
the
woman
original
nature
left
in
her
still
and
when
she
heard
a
light
step
approaching
the
door
opposite
to
that
by
which
she
had
entered
and
thought
of
the
wide
contrast
which
the
small
room
would
in
another
moment
contain
she
felt
burdened
with
the
sense
of
her
own
deep
shame
and
shrunk
as
though
she
could
scarcely
bear
the
presence
of
her
with
whom
she
had
sought
this
interview
but
struggling
with
these
better
feelings
was
pride
the
vice
of
the
lowest
and
most
debased
creatures
no
less
than
of
the
high
and
the
miserable
companion
of
thieves
and
ruffians
the
fallen
outcast
of
low
haunts
the
associate
of
the
scourings
of
the
jails
and
hulks
living
within
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
itself
even
this
degraded
being
felt
too
proud
to
betray
a
feeble
gleam
of
the
womanly
feeling
which
she
thought
a
weakness
but
which
alone
connected
her
with
that
humanity
of
which
her
wasting
life
had
obliterated
so
many
many
traces
when
a
very
child
she
raised
her
eyes
sufficiently
to
observe
that
the
figure
which
presented
itself
was
that
of
a
slight
and
beautiful
girl
then
bending
them
on
the
ground
she
tossed
her
head
with
affected
carelessness
as
she
said
a
hard
matter
to
get
to
see
you
lady
if
i
had
taken
offence
and
gone
away
as
many
would
have
done
you
have
been
sorry
for
it
one
day
and
not
without
reason
either
am
very
sorry
if
any
one
has
behaved
harshly
to
you
replied
rose
not
think
of
that
tell
me
why
you
wished
to
see
me
i
am
the
person
you
inquired
for
the
kind
tone
of
this
answer
the
sweet
voice
the
gentle
manner
the
absence
of
any
accent
of
haughtiness
or
displeasure
took
the
girl
completely
by
surprise
and
she
burst
into
tears
lady
lady
she
said
clasping
her
hands
passionately
before
her
face
there
was
more
like
you
there
would
be
fewer
like
me
there
would
there
would
down
said
rose
earnestly
you
are
in
poverty
or
affliction
i
shall
be
truly
glad
to
relieve
you
if
i
can
i
shall
indeed
sit
down
me
stand
lady
said
the
girl
still
weeping
do
not
speak
to
me
so
kindly
till
you
know
me
better
it
is
growing
late
is
is
that
door
shut
said
rose
recoiling
a
few
steps
as
if
to
be
nearer
assistance
in
case
she
should
require
it
said
the
girl
am
about
to
put
my
life
and
the
lives
of
others
in
your
hands
i
am
the
girl
that
dragged
little
oliver
back
to
old
fagin
on
the
night
he
went
out
from
the
house
in
pentonville
said
rose
maylie
lady
replied
the
girl
am
the
infamous
creature
you
have
heard
of
that
lives
among
the
thieves
and
that
never
from
the
first
moment
i
can
recollect
my
eyes
and
senses
opening
on
london
streets
have
known
any
better
life
or
kinder
words
than
they
have
given
me
so
help
me
god
do
not
mind
shrinking
openly
from
me
lady
i
am
younger
than
you
would
think
to
look
at
me
but
i
am
well
used
to
it
the
poorest
women
fall
back
as
i
make
my
way
along
the
crowded
pavement
dreadful
things
are
these
said
rose
involuntarily
falling
from
her
strange
companion
heaven
upon
your
knees
dear
lady
cried
the
girl
you
had
friends
to
care
for
and
keep
you
in
your
childhood
and
that
you
were
never
in
the
midst
of
cold
and
hunger
and
riot
and
drunkenness
and
and
something
worse
than
all
as
i
have
been
from
my
cradle
i
may
use
the
word
for
the
alley
and
the
gutter
were
mine
as
they
will
be
my
deathbed
pity
you
said
rose
in
a
broken
voice
wrings
my
heart
to
hear
you
bless
you
for
your
goodness
rejoined
the
girl
you
knew
what
i
am
sometimes
you
would
pity
me
indeed
but
i
have
stolen
away
from
those
who
would
surely
murder
me
if
they
knew
i
had
been
here
to
tell
you
what
i
have
overheard
do
you
know
a
man
named
monks
said
rose
knows
you
replied
the
girl
knew
you
were
here
for
it
was
by
hearing
him
tell
the
place
that
i
found
you
out
never
heard
the
name
said
rose
he
goes
by
some
other
amongst
us
rejoined
the
girl
i
more
than
thought
before
some
time
ago
and
soon
after
oliver
was
put
into
your
house
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
i
suspecting
this
man
listened
to
a
conversation
held
between
him
and
fagin
in
the
dark
i
found
out
from
what
i
heard
that
monks
the
man
i
asked
you
about
you
know
said
rose
understand
that
monks
pursued
the
girl
seen
him
accidently
with
two
of
our
boys
on
the
day
we
first
lost
him
and
had
known
him
directly
to
be
the
same
child
that
he
was
watching
for
though
i
could
make
out
why
a
bargain
was
struck
with
fagin
that
if
oliver
was
got
back
he
should
have
a
certain
sum
and
he
was
to
have
more
for
making
him
a
thief
which
this
monks
wanted
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
what
purpose
asked
rose
caught
sight
of
my
shadow
on
the
wall
as
i
listened
in
the
hope
of
finding
out
said
the
girl
there
are
not
many
people
besides
me
that
could
have
got
out
of
their
way
in
time
to
escape
discovery
but
i
did
and
i
saw
him
no
more
till
last
night
what
occurred
then
tell
you
lady
last
night
he
came
again
again
they
went
upstairs
and
i
wrapping
myself
up
so
that
my
shadow
would
not
betray
me
again
listened
at
the
door
the
first
words
i
heard
monks
say
were
these
so
the
only
proofs
of
the
boy
identity
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
the
old
hag
that
received
them
from
the
mother
is
rotting
in
her
coffin
they
laughed
and
talked
of
his
success
in
doing
this
and
monks
talking
on
about
the
boy
and
getting
very
wild
said
that
though
he
had
got
the
young
devil
money
safely
now
rather
have
had
it
the
other
way
for
what
a
game
it
would
have
been
to
have
brought
down
the
boast
of
the
father
will
by
driving
him
through
every
jail
in
town
and
then
hauling
him
up
for
some
capital
felony
which
fagin
could
easily
manage
after
having
made
a
good
profit
of
him
besides
is
all
this
said
rose
truth
lady
though
it
comes
from
my
lips
replied
the
girl
he
said
with
oaths
common
enough
in
my
ears
but
strange
to
yours
that
if
he
could
gratify
his
hatred
by
taking
the
boy
life
without
bringing
his
own
neck
in
danger
he
would
but
as
he
could
he
be
upon
the
watch
to
meet
him
at
every
turn
in
life
and
if
he
took
advantage
of
his
birth
and
history
he
might
harm
him
yet
in
short
fagin
he
says
jew
as
you
are
you
never
laid
such
snares
as
i
contrive
for
my
young
brother
oliver
brother
exclaimed
rose
were
his
words
said
nancy
glancing
uneasily
round
as
she
had
scarcely
ceased
to
do
since
she
began
to
speak
for
a
vision
of
sikes
haunted
her
perpetually
more
when
he
spoke
of
you
and
the
other
lady
and
said
it
seemed
contrived
by
heaven
or
the
devil
against
him
that
oliver
should
come
into
your
hands
he
laughed
and
said
there
was
some
comfort
in
that
too
for
how
many
thousands
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
would
you
not
give
if
you
had
them
to
know
who
your
spaniel
was
do
not
mean
said
rose
turning
very
pale
tell
me
that
this
was
said
in
earnest
spoke
in
hard
and
angry
earnest
if
a
man
ever
did
replied
the
girl
shaking
her
head
is
an
earnest
man
when
his
hatred
is
up
i
know
many
who
do
worse
things
but
i
rather
listen
to
them
all
a
dozen
times
than
to
that
monks
once
it
is
growing
late
and
i
have
to
reach
home
without
suspicion
of
having
been
on
such
an
errand
as
this
i
must
get
back
quickly
what
can
i
do
said
rose
what
use
can
i
turn
this
communication
without
you
back
why
do
you
wish
to
return
to
companions
you
paint
in
such
terrible
colors
if
you
repeat
this
information
to
a
gentleman
whom
i
can
summon
in
an
instant
from
the
next
room
you
can
be
consigned
to
some
place
of
safety
without
half
an
hour
delay
wish
to
go
back
said
the
girl
must
go
back
because
how
can
i
tell
such
things
to
an
innocent
lady
like
you
because
among
the
men
i
have
told
you
of
there
is
one
the
most
desperate
among
them
all
that
i
ca
leave
no
not
even
to
be
saved
from
the
life
i
am
leading
now
having
interfered
in
this
dear
boy
behalf
before
said
rose
coming
here
at
so
great
a
risk
to
tell
me
what
you
have
heard
your
manner
which
convinces
me
of
the
truth
of
what
you
say
your
evident
contrition
and
sense
of
shame
all
lead
me
to
believe
that
you
might
yet
be
reclaimed
oh
said
the
earnest
girl
folding
her
hands
as
the
tears
coursed
down
her
face
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
entreaties
of
one
of
your
own
sex
the
first
the
first
i
do
believe
who
ever
appealed
to
you
in
the
voice
of
pity
and
compassion
do
hear
my
words
and
let
me
save
you
yet
for
better
things
cried
the
girl
sinking
on
her
knees
sweet
angel
lady
you
the
first
that
ever
blessed
me
with
such
words
as
these
and
if
i
had
heard
them
years
ago
they
might
have
turned
me
from
a
life
of
sin
and
sorrow
but
it
is
too
late
it
is
too
late
is
never
too
late
said
rose
penitence
and
atonement
is
cried
the
girl
writhing
in
agony
of
her
mind
can
not
leave
him
now
i
could
not
be
his
death
should
you
be
asked
rose
could
save
him
cried
the
girl
i
told
others
what
i
have
told
you
and
led
to
their
being
taken
he
would
be
sure
to
die
he
is
the
boldest
and
has
been
so
cruel
it
possible
cried
rose
for
such
a
man
as
this
you
can
resign
every
future
hope
and
the
certainty
of
immediate
rescue
it
is
madness
do
know
what
it
is
answered
the
girl
only
know
that
it
is
so
and
not
with
me
alone
but
with
hundreds
of
others
as
bad
and
wretched
as
myself
i
must
go
back
whether
it
is
god
wrath
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
drawn
back
to
him
through
every
suffering
and
ill
usage
and
i
should
be
i
believe
if
i
knew
that
i
was
to
die
by
his
hand
at
last
am
i
to
do
said
rose
should
not
let
you
depart
from
me
thus
should
lady
and
i
know
you
will
rejoined
the
girl
rising
will
not
stop
my
going
because
i
have
trusted
in
your
goodness
and
forced
no
promise
from
you
as
i
might
have
done
what
use
then
is
the
communication
you
have
made
said
rose
mystery
must
be
investigated
or
how
will
its
disclosure
to
me
benefit
oliver
whom
you
are
anxious
to
serve
must
have
some
kind
gentleman
about
you
that
will
hear
it
as
a
secret
and
advise
you
what
to
do
rejoined
the
girl
where
can
i
find
you
again
when
it
is
necessary
asked
rose
do
not
seek
to
know
where
these
dreadful
people
live
but
where
will
you
be
walking
or
passing
at
any
settled
period
from
this
time
you
promise
me
that
you
will
have
my
secret
strictly
kept
and
come
alone
or
with
the
only
other
person
that
knows
it
and
that
i
shall
not
be
watched
or
followed
asked
the
girl
promise
you
solemnly
answered
rose
sunday
night
from
eleven
until
the
clock
strikes
twelve
said
the
girl
without
hesitation
will
walk
on
london
bridge
if
i
am
alive
another
moment
interposed
rose
as
the
girl
moved
hurriedly
towards
the
door
once
again
on
your
own
condition
and
the
opportunity
you
have
of
escaping
from
it
you
have
a
claim
on
me
not
only
as
the
voluntary
bearer
of
this
intelligence
but
as
a
woman
lost
almost
beyond
redemption
will
you
return
to
this
gang
of
robbers
and
to
this
man
when
a
word
can
save
you
what
fascination
is
it
that
can
take
you
back
and
make
you
cling
to
wickedness
and
misery
oh
is
there
no
chord
in
your
heart
that
i
can
touch
is
there
nothing
left
to
which
i
can
appeal
against
this
terrible
infatuation
ladies
as
young
and
good
and
beautiful
as
you
are
replied
the
girl
steadily
away
your
hearts
love
will
carry
you
all
lengths
even
such
as
you
who
have
home
friends
other
admirers
everything
to
fill
them
when
such
as
i
who
have
no
certain
roof
but
the
coffinlid
and
no
friend
in
sickness
or
death
but
the
hospital
nurse
set
our
rotten
hearts
on
any
man
and
let
him
fill
the
place
that
has
been
a
blank
through
all
our
wretched
lives
who
can
hope
to
cure
us
pity
us
lady
pity
us
for
having
only
one
feeling
of
the
woman
left
and
for
having
that
turned
by
a
heavy
judgment
from
a
comfort
and
a
pride
into
a
new
means
of
violence
and
suffering
will
said
rose
after
a
pause
some
money
from
me
which
may
enable
you
to
live
without
dishonesty
at
all
events
until
we
meet
again
a
penny
replied
the
girl
waving
her
hand
not
close
your
heart
against
all
my
efforts
to
help
you
said
rose
stepping
gently
forward
wish
to
serve
you
indeed
would
serve
me
best
lady
replied
the
girl
wringing
her
hands
you
could
take
my
life
at
once
for
i
have
felt
more
grief
to
think
of
what
i
am
than
i
ever
did
before
and
it
would
be
something
not
to
die
in
the
hell
in
which
i
have
lived
god
bless
you
sweet
lady
and
send
as
much
happiness
on
your
head
as
i
have
brought
shame
on
mine
thus
speaking
and
sobbing
aloud
the
unhappy
creature
turned
away
while
rose
maylie
overpowered
by
this
extraordinary
interview
which
had
more
the
semblance
of
a
rapid
dream
than
an
actual
occurrence
sank
into
a
chair
and
endeavoured
to
collect
her
wandering
thoughts
chapter
xli
containing
fresh
discoveries
and
showing
that
suprises
like
misfortunes
seldom
come
alone
her
situation
was
indeed
one
of
no
common
trial
and
difficulty
while
she
felt
the
most
eager
and
burning
desire
to
penetrate
the
mystery
in
which
oliver
history
was
enveloped
she
could
not
but
hold
sacred
the
confidence
which
the
miserable
woman
with
whom
she
had
just
conversed
had
reposed
in
her
as
a
young
and
guileless
girl
her
words
and
manner
had
touched
rose
maylie
heart
and
mingled
with
her
love
for
her
young
charge
and
scarcely
less
intense
in
its
truth
and
fervour
was
her
fond
wish
to
win
the
outcast
back
to
repentance
and
hope
they
purposed
remaining
in
london
only
three
days
prior
to
departing
for
some
weeks
to
a
distant
part
of
the
coast
it
was
now
midnight
of
the
first
day
what
course
of
action
could
she
determine
upon
which
could
be
adopted
in
hours
or
how
could
she
postpone
the
journey
without
exciting
suspicion
losberne
was
with
them
and
would
be
for
the
next
two
days
but
rose
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
excellent
impetuosity
and
foresaw
too
clearly
the
wrath
with
which
in
the
first
explosion
of
his
indignation
he
would
regard
the
instrument
of
oliver
recapture
to
trust
him
with
the
secret
when
her
representations
in
the
girl
behalf
could
be
seconded
by
no
experienced
person
these
were
all
reasons
for
the
greatest
caution
and
most
circumspect
behaviour
in
communicating
it
to
maylie
whose
first
impulse
would
infallibly
be
to
hold
a
conference
with
the
worthy
doctor
on
the
subject
as
to
resorting
to
any
legal
adviser
even
if
she
had
known
how
to
do
so
it
was
scarcely
to
be
thought
of
for
the
same
reason
once
the
thought
occurred
to
her
of
seeking
assistance
from
harry
but
this
awakened
the
recollection
of
their
last
parting
and
it
seemed
unworthy
of
her
to
call
him
back
when
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
as
she
pursued
this
train
of
reflection
he
might
have
by
this
time
learnt
to
forget
her
and
to
be
happier
away
disturbed
by
these
different
reflections
inclining
now
to
one
course
and
then
to
another
and
again
recoiling
from
all
as
each
successive
consideration
presented
itself
to
her
mind
rose
passed
a
sleepless
and
anxious
night
after
more
communing
with
herself
next
day
she
arrived
at
the
desperate
conclusion
of
consulting
harry
it
be
painful
to
him
she
thought
come
back
here
how
painful
it
will
be
to
me
but
perhaps
he
will
not
come
he
may
write
or
he
may
come
himself
and
studiously
abstain
from
meeting
me
he
did
when
he
went
away
i
hardly
thought
he
would
but
it
was
better
for
us
both
and
here
rose
dropped
the
pen
and
turned
away
as
though
the
very
paper
which
was
to
be
her
messenger
should
not
see
her
weep
she
had
taken
up
the
same
pen
and
laid
it
down
again
fifty
times
and
had
considered
and
reconsidered
the
first
line
of
her
letter
without
writing
the
first
word
when
oliver
who
had
been
walking
in
the
streets
with
giles
for
a
entered
the
room
in
such
breathless
haste
and
violent
agitation
as
seemed
to
betoken
some
new
cause
of
alarm
makes
you
look
so
flurried
asked
rose
advancing
to
meet
him
hardly
know
how
i
feel
as
if
i
should
be
choked
replied
the
boy
dear
to
think
that
i
should
see
him
at
last
and
you
should
be
able
to
know
that
i
have
told
you
the
truth
never
thought
you
had
told
us
anything
but
the
truth
said
rose
soothing
him
what
is
this
of
whom
do
you
speak
have
seen
the
gentleman
replied
oliver
scarcely
able
to
articulate
gentleman
who
was
so
good
to
me
brownlow
that
we
have
so
often
talked
about
asked
rose
out
of
a
coach
replied
oliver
shedding
tears
of
delight
going
into
a
house
i
did
speak
to
him
i
could
speak
to
him
for
he
did
see
me
and
i
trembled
so
that
i
was
not
able
to
go
up
to
him
but
giles
asked
for
me
whether
he
lived
there
and
they
said
he
did
look
here
said
oliver
opening
a
scrap
of
paper
it
is
here
where
he
lives
i
going
there
directly
oh
dear
me
dear
me
what
shall
i
do
when
i
come
to
see
him
and
hear
him
speak
again
with
her
attention
not
a
little
distracted
by
these
and
a
great
many
other
incoherent
exclamations
of
joy
rose
read
the
address
which
was
craven
street
in
the
strand
she
very
soon
determined
upon
turning
the
discovery
to
account
she
said
them
to
fetch
a
and
be
ready
to
go
with
me
i
will
take
you
there
directly
without
a
minute
loss
of
time
i
will
only
tell
my
aunt
that
we
are
going
out
for
an
hour
and
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
oliver
needed
no
prompting
to
despatch
and
in
little
more
than
five
minutes
they
were
on
their
way
to
craven
street
when
they
arrived
there
rose
left
oliver
in
the
coach
under
pretence
of
preparing
the
old
gentleman
to
receive
him
and
sending
up
her
card
by
the
servant
requested
to
see
brownlow
on
very
pressing
business
the
servant
soon
returned
to
beg
that
she
would
walk
upstairs
and
following
him
into
an
upper
room
miss
maylie
was
presented
to
an
elderly
gentleman
of
benevolent
appearance
in
a
coat
at
no
great
distance
from
whom
was
seated
another
old
gentleman
in
nankeen
breeches
and
gaiters
who
did
not
look
particularly
benevolent
and
who
was
sitting
with
his
hands
clasped
on
the
top
of
a
thick
stick
and
his
chin
propped
thereupon
me
said
the
gentleman
in
the
coat
hastily
rising
with
great
politeness
beg
your
pardon
young
lady
i
imagined
it
was
some
importunate
person
who
i
beg
you
will
excuse
me
be
seated
pray
brownlow
i
believe
sir
said
rose
glancing
from
the
other
gentleman
to
the
one
who
had
spoken
is
my
name
said
the
old
gentleman
is
my
friend
grimwig
grimwig
will
you
leave
us
for
a
few
minutes
believe
interposed
miss
maylie
at
this
period
of
our
interview
i
need
not
give
that
gentleman
the
trouble
of
going
away
if
i
am
correctly
informed
he
is
cognizant
of
the
business
on
which
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
brownlow
inclined
his
head
grimwig
who
had
made
one
very
stiff
bow
and
risen
from
his
chair
made
another
very
stiff
bow
and
dropped
into
it
again
shall
surprise
you
very
much
i
have
no
doubt
said
rose
naturally
embarrassed
you
once
showed
great
benevolence
and
goodness
to
a
very
dear
young
friend
of
mine
and
i
am
sure
you
will
take
an
interest
in
hearing
of
him
again
said
brownlow
twist
you
knew
him
as
replied
rose
the
words
no
sooner
escaped
her
lips
than
grimwig
who
had
been
affecting
to
dip
into
a
large
book
that
lay
on
the
table
upset
it
with
a
great
crash
and
falling
back
in
his
chair
discharged
from
his
features
every
expression
but
one
of
unmitigated
wonder
and
indulged
in
a
prolonged
and
vacant
stare
then
as
if
ashamed
of
having
betrayed
so
much
emotion
he
jerked
himself
as
it
were
by
a
convulsion
into
his
former
attitude
and
looking
out
straight
before
him
emitted
a
long
deep
whistle
which
seemed
at
last
not
to
be
discharged
on
empty
air
but
to
die
away
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
stomach
browlow
was
no
less
surprised
although
his
astonishment
was
not
expressed
in
the
same
eccentric
manner
he
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
miss
maylie
and
said
me
the
favour
my
dear
young
lady
to
leave
entirely
out
of
the
question
that
goodness
and
benevolence
of
which
you
speak
and
of
which
nobody
else
knows
anything
and
if
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
produce
any
evidence
which
will
alter
the
unfavourable
opinion
i
was
once
induced
to
entertain
of
that
poor
child
in
heaven
name
put
me
in
possession
of
it
bad
one
i
eat
my
head
if
he
is
not
a
bad
one
growled
grimwig
speaking
by
some
ventriloquial
power
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
is
a
child
of
a
noble
nature
and
a
warm
heart
said
rose
colouring
that
power
which
has
thought
fit
to
try
him
beyond
his
years
has
planted
in
his
breast
affections
and
feelings
which
would
do
honour
to
many
who
have
numbered
his
days
six
times
over
only
said
grimwig
with
the
same
rigid
face
as
the
devil
in
it
if
this
oliver
is
not
twelve
years
old
at
least
i
do
see
the
application
of
that
remark
not
heed
my
friend
miss
maylie
said
brownlow
does
not
mean
what
he
says
he
does
growled
grimwig
he
does
not
said
brownlow
obviously
rising
in
wrath
as
he
spoke
eat
his
head
if
he
does
growled
grimwig
would
deserve
to
have
it
knocked
off
if
he
does
said
brownlow
he
uncommonly
like
to
see
any
man
offer
to
do
it
responded
grimwig
knocking
his
stick
upon
the
floor
having
gone
thus
far
the
two
old
gentlemen
severally
took
snuff
and
afterwards
shook
hands
according
to
their
invariable
custom
miss
maylie
said
brownlow
return
to
the
subject
in
which
your
humanity
is
so
much
interested
will
you
let
me
know
what
intelligence
you
have
of
this
poor
child
allowing
me
to
promise
that
i
exhausted
every
means
in
my
power
of
discovering
him
and
that
since
i
have
been
absent
from
this
country
my
first
impression
that
he
had
imposed
upon
me
and
had
been
persuaded
by
his
former
associates
to
rob
me
has
been
considerably
shaken
rose
who
had
had
time
to
collect
her
thoughts
at
once
related
in
a
few
natural
words
all
that
had
befallen
oliver
since
he
left
brownlow
house
reserving
nancy
information
for
that
private
ear
and
concluding
with
the
assurance
that
his
only
sorrow
for
some
months
past
had
been
not
being
able
to
meet
with
his
former
benefactor
and
friend
god
said
the
old
gentleman
is
great
happiness
to
me
great
happiness
but
you
have
not
told
me
where
he
is
now
miss
maylie
you
must
pardon
my
finding
fault
with
you
but
why
not
have
brought
him
is
waiting
in
a
coach
at
the
door
replied
rose
this
door
cried
the
old
gentleman
with
which
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
down
the
stairs
up
the
coachsteps
and
into
the
coach
without
another
word
when
the
closed
behind
him
grimwig
lifted
up
his
head
and
converting
one
of
the
hind
legs
of
his
chair
into
a
pivot
described
three
distinct
circles
with
the
assistance
of
his
stick
and
the
table
sitting
in
it
all
the
time
after
performing
this
evolution
he
rose
and
limped
as
fast
as
he
could
up
and
down
the
room
at
least
a
dozen
times
and
then
stopping
suddenly
before
rose
kissed
her
without
the
slightest
preface
he
said
as
the
young
lady
rose
in
some
alarm
at
this
unusual
proceeding
be
afraid
i
old
enough
to
be
your
grandfather
you
a
sweet
girl
i
like
you
here
they
are
in
fact
as
he
threw
himself
at
one
dexterous
dive
into
his
former
seat
brownlow
returned
accompanied
by
oliver
whom
grimwig
received
very
graciously
and
if
the
gratification
of
that
moment
had
been
the
only
reward
for
all
her
anxiety
and
care
in
oliver
behalf
rose
maylie
would
have
been
well
repaid
is
somebody
else
who
should
not
be
forgotten
by
the
bye
said
brownlow
ringing
the
bell
bedwin
here
if
you
please
the
old
housekeeper
answered
the
summons
with
all
dispatch
and
dropping
a
curtsey
at
the
door
waited
for
orders
you
get
blinder
every
day
bedwin
said
brownlow
rather
testily
that
i
do
sir
replied
the
old
lady
eyes
at
my
time
of
life
do
improve
with
age
sir
could
have
told
you
that
rejoined
brownlow
put
on
your
glasses
and
see
if
you
ca
find
out
what
you
were
wanted
for
will
you
the
old
lady
began
to
rummage
in
her
pocket
for
her
spectacles
but
oliver
patience
was
not
proof
against
this
new
trial
and
yielding
to
his
first
impulse
he
sprang
into
her
arms
be
good
to
me
cried
the
old
lady
embracing
him
is
my
innocent
boy
dear
old
nurse
cried
oliver
would
come
back
i
knew
he
would
said
the
old
lady
holding
him
in
her
arms
well
he
looks
and
how
like
a
gentleman
son
he
is
dressed
again
where
have
you
been
this
long
long
while
ah
the
same
sweet
face
but
not
so
pale
the
same
soft
eye
but
not
so
sad
i
have
never
forgotten
them
or
his
quiet
smile
but
have
seen
them
every
day
side
by
side
with
those
of
my
own
dear
children
dead
and
gone
since
i
was
a
lightsome
young
creature
running
on
thus
and
now
holding
oliver
from
her
to
mark
how
he
had
grown
now
clasping
him
to
her
and
passing
her
fingers
fondly
through
his
hair
the
good
soul
laughed
and
wept
upon
his
neck
by
turns
leaving
her
and
oliver
to
compare
notes
at
leisure
brownlow
led
the
way
into
another
room
and
there
heard
from
rose
a
full
narration
of
her
interview
with
nancy
which
occasioned
him
no
little
surprise
and
perplexity
rose
also
explained
her
reasons
for
not
confiding
in
her
friend
losberne
in
the
first
instance
the
old
gentleman
considered
that
she
had
acted
prudently
and
readily
undertook
to
hold
solemn
conference
with
the
worthy
doctor
himself
to
afford
him
an
early
opportunity
for
the
execution
of
this
design
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
call
at
the
hotel
at
eight
that
evening
and
that
in
the
meantime
maylie
should
be
cautiously
informed
of
all
that
had
occurred
these
preliminaries
adjusted
rose
and
oliver
returned
home
rose
had
by
no
means
overrated
the
measure
of
the
good
doctor
wrath
nancy
history
was
no
sooner
unfolded
to
him
than
he
poured
forth
a
shower
of
mingled
threats
and
execrations
threatened
to
make
her
the
first
victim
of
the
combined
ingenuity
of
blathers
and
duff
and
actually
put
on
his
hat
preparatory
to
sallying
forth
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
those
worthies
and
doubtless
he
would
in
this
first
outbreak
have
carried
the
intention
into
effect
without
a
consideration
of
the
consequences
if
he
had
not
been
restrained
in
part
by
corresponding
violence
on
the
side
of
brownlow
who
was
himself
of
an
irascible
temperament
and
party
by
such
arguments
and
representations
as
seemed
best
calculated
to
dissuade
him
from
his
hotbrained
purpose
what
the
devil
is
to
be
done
said
the
impetuous
doctor
when
they
had
rejoined
the
two
ladies
we
to
pass
a
vote
of
thanks
to
all
these
vagabonds
male
and
female
and
beg
them
to
accept
a
hundred
pounds
or
so
apiece
as
a
trifling
mark
of
our
esteem
and
some
slight
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
to
oliver
exactly
that
rejoined
brownlow
laughing
we
must
proceed
gently
and
with
great
care
and
care
exclaimed
the
doctor
send
them
one
and
all
to
mind
where
interposed
brownlow
reflect
whether
sending
them
anywhere
is
likely
to
attain
the
object
we
have
in
view
object
asked
the
doctor
the
discovery
of
oliver
parentage
and
regaining
for
him
the
inheritance
of
which
if
this
story
be
true
he
has
been
fraudulently
deprived
said
losberne
cooling
himself
with
his
almost
forgot
that
see
pursued
brownlow
this
poor
girl
entirely
out
of
the
question
and
supposing
it
were
possible
to
bring
these
scoundrels
to
justice
without
compromising
her
safety
what
good
should
we
bring
about
a
few
of
them
at
least
in
all
probability
suggested
the
doctor
transporting
the
rest
good
replied
brownlow
smiling
no
doubt
they
will
bring
that
about
for
themselves
in
the
fulness
of
time
and
if
we
step
in
to
forestall
them
it
seems
to
me
that
we
shall
be
performing
a
very
quixotic
act
in
direct
opposition
to
our
own
interest
or
at
least
to
oliver
which
is
the
same
thing
inquired
the
doctor
it
is
quite
clear
that
we
shall
have
extreme
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
unless
we
can
bring
this
man
monks
upon
his
knees
that
can
only
be
done
by
stratagem
and
by
catching
him
when
he
is
not
surrounded
by
these
people
for
suppose
he
were
apprehended
we
have
no
proof
against
him
he
is
not
even
so
far
as
we
know
or
as
the
facts
appear
to
us
concerned
with
the
gang
in
any
of
their
robberies
if
he
were
not
discharged
it
is
very
unlikely
that
he
could
receive
any
further
punishment
than
being
committed
to
prison
as
a
rogue
and
vagabond
and
of
course
ever
afterwards
his
mouth
would
be
so
obstinately
closed
that
he
might
as
well
for
our
purposes
be
deaf
dumb
blind
and
an
idiot
said
the
doctor
impetuously
put
it
to
you
again
whether
you
think
it
reasonable
that
this
promise
to
the
girl
should
be
considered
binding
a
promise
made
with
the
best
and
kindest
intentions
but
really
not
discuss
the
point
my
dear
young
lady
pray
said
brownlow
interrupting
rose
as
she
was
about
to
speak
promise
shall
be
kept
i
do
think
it
will
in
the
slightest
degree
interfere
with
our
proceedings
but
before
we
can
resolve
upon
any
precise
course
of
action
it
will
be
necessary
to
see
the
girl
to
ascertain
from
her
whether
she
will
point
out
this
monks
on
the
understanding
that
he
is
to
be
dealt
with
by
us
and
not
by
the
law
or
if
she
will
not
or
can
not
do
that
to
procure
from
her
such
an
account
of
his
haunts
and
description
of
his
person
as
will
enable
us
to
identify
him
she
can
not
be
seen
until
next
sunday
night
this
is
tuesday
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
meantime
we
remain
perfectly
quiet
and
keep
these
matters
secret
even
from
oliver
himself
although
losberne
received
with
many
wry
faces
a
proposal
involving
a
delay
of
five
whole
days
he
was
fain
to
admit
that
no
better
course
occurred
to
him
just
then
and
as
both
rose
and
maylie
sided
very
strongly
with
brownlow
that
gentleman
proposition
was
carried
unanimously
should
like
he
said
call
in
the
aid
of
my
friend
grimwig
he
is
a
strange
creature
but
a
shrewd
one
and
might
prove
of
material
assistance
to
us
i
should
say
that
he
was
bred
a
lawyer
and
quitted
the
bar
in
disgust
because
he
had
only
one
brief
and
a
motion
of
course
in
twenty
years
though
whether
that
is
recommendation
or
not
you
must
determine
for
yourselves
have
no
objection
to
your
calling
in
your
friend
if
i
may
call
in
mine
said
the
doctor
must
put
it
to
the
vote
replied
brownlow
may
he
be
lady
son
and
this
young
lady
very
old
friend
said
the
doctor
motioning
towards
maylie
and
concluding
with
an
expressive
glance
at
her
niece
rose
blushed
deeply
but
she
did
not
make
any
audible
objection
to
this
motion
possibly
she
felt
in
a
hopeless
minority
and
harry
maylie
and
grimwig
were
accordingly
added
to
the
committee
stay
in
town
of
course
said
maylie
there
remains
the
slightest
prospect
of
prosecuting
this
inquiry
with
a
chance
of
success
i
will
spare
neither
trouble
nor
expense
in
behalf
of
the
object
in
which
we
are
all
so
deeply
interested
and
i
am
content
to
remain
here
if
it
be
for
twelve
months
so
long
as
you
assure
me
that
any
hope
remains
rejoined
brownlow
as
i
see
on
the
faces
about
me
a
disposition
to
inquire
how
it
happened
that
i
was
not
in
the
way
to
corroborate
oliver
tale
and
had
so
suddenly
left
the
kingdom
let
me
stipulate
that
i
shall
be
asked
no
questions
until
such
time
as
i
may
deem
it
expedient
to
forestall
them
by
telling
my
own
story
believe
me
i
make
this
request
with
good
reason
for
i
might
otherwise
excite
hopes
destined
never
to
be
realised
and
only
increase
difficulties
and
disappointments
already
quite
numerous
enough
come
supper
has
been
announced
and
young
oliver
who
is
all
alone
in
the
next
room
will
have
begun
to
think
by
this
time
that
we
have
wearied
of
his
company
and
entered
into
some
dark
conspiracy
to
thrust
him
forth
upon
the
world
with
these
words
the
old
gentleman
gave
his
hand
to
maylie
and
escorted
her
into
the
losberne
followed
leading
rose
and
the
council
was
for
the
present
effectually
broken
up
chapter
xlii
an
old
acquaintance
of
oliver
exhibiting
decided
marks
of
genius
becomes
a
public
character
in
the
metropolis
upon
the
night
when
nancy
having
lulled
sikes
to
sleep
hurried
on
her
mission
to
rose
maylie
there
advanced
towards
london
by
the
great
north
road
two
persons
upon
whom
it
is
expedient
that
this
history
should
bestow
some
attention
they
were
a
man
and
woman
or
perhaps
they
would
be
better
described
as
a
male
and
female
for
the
former
was
one
of
those
shambling
bony
people
to
whom
it
is
difficult
to
assign
any
precise
age
looking
as
they
do
when
they
are
yet
boys
like
undergrown
men
and
when
they
are
almost
men
like
overgrown
boys
the
woman
was
young
but
of
a
robust
and
hardy
make
as
she
need
have
been
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
heavy
bundle
which
was
strapped
to
her
back
her
companion
was
not
encumbered
with
much
luggage
as
there
merely
dangled
from
a
stick
which
he
carried
over
his
shoulder
a
small
parcel
wrapped
in
a
common
handkerchief
and
apparently
light
enough
this
circumstance
added
to
the
length
of
his
legs
which
were
of
unusual
extent
enabled
him
with
much
ease
to
keep
some
paces
in
advance
of
his
companion
to
whom
he
occasionally
turned
with
an
impatient
jerk
of
the
head
as
if
reproaching
her
tardiness
and
urging
her
to
greater
exertion
thus
they
had
toiled
along
the
dusty
road
taking
little
heed
of
any
object
within
sight
save
when
they
stepped
aside
to
allow
a
wider
passage
for
the
which
were
whirling
out
of
town
until
they
passed
through
highgate
archway
when
the
foremost
traveller
stopped
and
called
impatiently
to
his
companion
on
ca
yer
what
a
lazybones
yer
are
charlotte
a
heavy
load
i
can
tell
you
said
the
female
coming
up
almost
breathless
with
fatigue
what
are
yer
talking
about
what
are
yer
made
for
rejoined
the
male
traveller
changing
his
own
little
bundle
as
he
spoke
to
the
other
shoulder
there
yer
are
resting
again
well
if
yer
enough
to
tire
anybody
patience
out
i
do
know
what
is
it
much
farther
asked
the
woman
resting
herself
against
a
bank
and
looking
up
with
the
perspiration
streaming
from
her
face
farther
yer
as
good
as
there
said
the
tramper
pointing
out
before
him
there
those
are
the
lights
of
london
a
good
two
mile
off
at
least
said
the
woman
despondingly
mind
whether
they
two
mile
off
or
twenty
said
noah
claypole
for
he
it
was
get
up
and
come
on
or
i
kick
yer
and
so
i
give
yer
notice
as
noah
red
nose
grew
redder
with
anger
and
as
he
crossed
the
road
while
speaking
as
if
fully
prepared
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
the
woman
rose
without
any
further
remark
and
trudged
onward
by
his
side
do
you
mean
to
stop
for
the
night
noah
she
asked
after
they
had
walked
a
few
hundred
yards
should
i
know
replied
noah
whose
temper
had
been
considerably
impaired
by
walking
i
hope
said
charlotte
not
near
replied
claypole
not
near
so
think
it
not
i
tell
yer
that
i
do
mean
to
do
a
thing
that
enough
without
any
why
or
because
either
replied
claypole
with
dignity
you
need
be
so
cross
said
his
companion
pretty
thing
it
would
be
would
it
to
go
and
stop
at
the
very
first
outside
the
town
so
that
sowerberry
if
he
come
up
after
us
might
poke
in
his
old
nose
and
have
us
taken
back
in
a
cart
with
handcuffs
on
said
claypole
in
a
jeering
tone
i
shall
go
and
lose
myself
among
the
narrowest
streets
i
can
find
and
not
stop
till
we
come
to
the
very
house
i
can
set
eyes
on
yer
may
thanks
yer
stars
i
got
a
head
for
if
we
had
gone
at
first
the
wrong
road
a
purpose
and
come
back
across
country
have
been
locked
up
hard
and
fast
a
week
ago
my
lady
and
serve
yer
right
for
being
a
fool
know
i
ai
as
cunning
as
you
are
replied
charlotte
put
all
the
blame
on
me
and
say
i
should
have
been
locked
up
you
would
have
been
if
i
had
been
any
way
took
the
money
from
the
till
yer
know
yer
did
said
claypole
took
it
for
you
noah
dear
rejoined
charlotte
i
keep
it
asked
claypole
you
trusted
in
me
and
let
me
carry
it
like
a
dear
and
so
you
are
said
the
lady
chucking
him
under
the
chin
and
drawing
her
arm
through
his
this
was
indeed
the
case
but
as
it
was
not
claypole
habit
to
repose
a
blind
and
foolish
confidence
in
anybody
it
should
be
observed
in
justice
to
that
gentleman
that
he
had
trusted
charlotte
to
this
extent
in
order
that
if
they
were
pursued
the
money
might
be
found
on
her
which
would
leave
him
an
opportunity
of
asserting
his
innocence
of
any
theft
and
would
greatly
facilitate
his
chances
of
escape
of
course
he
entered
at
this
juncture
into
no
explanation
of
his
motives
and
they
walked
on
very
lovingly
together
in
pursuance
of
this
cautious
plan
claypole
went
on
without
halting
until
he
arrived
at
the
angel
at
islington
where
he
wisely
judged
from
the
crowd
of
passengers
and
numbers
of
vehicles
that
london
began
in
earnest
just
pausing
to
observe
which
appeared
the
most
crowded
streets
and
consequently
the
most
to
be
avoided
he
crossed
into
saint
john
road
and
was
soon
deep
in
the
obscurity
of
the
intricate
and
dirty
ways
which
lying
between
gray
inn
lane
and
smithfield
render
that
part
of
the
town
one
of
the
lowest
and
worst
that
improvement
has
left
in
the
midst
of
london
through
these
streets
noah
claypole
walked
dragging
charlotte
after
him
now
stepping
into
the
kennel
to
embrace
at
a
glance
the
whole
external
character
of
some
small
now
jogging
on
again
as
some
fancied
appearance
induced
him
to
believe
it
too
public
for
his
purpose
at
length
he
stopped
in
front
of
one
more
humble
in
appearance
and
more
dirty
than
any
he
had
yet
seen
and
having
crossed
over
and
surveyed
it
from
the
opposite
pavement
graciously
announced
his
intention
of
putting
up
there
for
the
night
give
us
the
bundle
said
noah
unstrapping
it
from
the
shoulders
and
slinging
it
over
his
own
do
yer
speak
except
when
yer
spoke
to
what
the
name
of
the
house
three
what
said
charlotte
cripples
repeated
noah
a
very
good
sign
too
now
then
keep
close
at
my
heels
and
come
along
with
these
injunctions
he
pushed
the
rattling
door
with
his
shoulder
and
entered
the
house
followed
by
his
companion
there
was
nobody
in
the
bar
but
a
young
jew
who
with
his
two
elbows
on
the
counter
was
reading
a
dirty
newspaper
he
stared
very
hard
at
noah
and
noah
stared
very
hard
at
him
if
noah
had
been
attired
in
his
dress
there
might
have
been
some
reason
for
the
jew
opening
his
eyes
so
wide
but
as
he
had
discarded
the
coat
and
badge
and
wore
a
short
over
his
leathers
there
seemed
no
particular
reason
for
his
appearance
exciting
so
much
attention
in
a
this
the
three
cripples
asked
noah
is
the
dabe
of
this
replied
the
jew
gentleman
we
met
on
the
road
coming
up
from
the
country
recommended
us
here
said
noah
nudging
charlotte
perhaps
to
call
her
attention
to
this
most
ingenious
device
for
attracting
respect
and
perhaps
to
warn
her
to
betray
no
surprise
want
to
sleep
here
dot
certaid
you
cad
said
barney
who
was
the
attendant
sprite
i
idquire
us
the
tap
and
give
us
a
bit
of
cold
meat
and
a
drop
of
beer
while
yer
inquiring
will
yer
said
noah
barney
complied
by
ushering
them
into
a
small
and
setting
the
required
viands
before
them
having
done
which
he
informed
the
travellers
that
they
could
be
lodged
that
night
and
left
the
amiable
couple
to
their
refreshment
now
this
was
immediately
behind
the
bar
and
some
steps
lower
so
that
any
person
connected
with
the
house
undrawing
a
small
curtain
which
concealed
a
single
pane
of
glass
fixed
in
the
wall
of
the
apartment
about
five
feet
from
its
flooring
could
not
only
look
down
upon
any
guests
in
the
without
any
great
hazard
of
being
observed
the
glass
being
in
a
dark
angle
of
the
wall
between
which
and
a
large
upright
beam
the
observer
had
to
thrust
himself
but
could
by
applying
his
ear
to
the
partition
ascertain
with
tolerable
distinctness
their
subject
of
conversation
the
landlord
of
the
house
had
not
withdrawn
his
eye
from
this
place
of
espial
for
five
minutes
and
barney
had
only
just
returned
from
making
the
communication
above
related
when
fagin
in
the
course
of
his
evening
business
came
into
the
bar
to
inquire
after
some
of
his
young
pupils
said
barney
id
the
next
roob
repeated
the
old
man
in
a
whisper
ad
rub
uds
too
added
barney
the
cuttry
but
subthig
in
your
way
or
bistaked
fagin
appeared
to
receive
this
communication
with
great
interest
mounting
a
stool
he
cautiously
applied
his
eye
to
the
pane
of
glass
from
which
secret
post
he
could
see
claypole
taking
cold
beef
from
the
dish
and
porter
from
the
pot
and
administering
homeopathic
doses
of
both
to
charlotte
who
sat
patiently
by
eating
and
drinking
at
his
pleasure
he
whispered
looking
round
to
barney
like
that
looks
he
be
of
use
to
us
he
knows
how
to
train
the
girl
already
do
make
as
much
noise
as
a
mouse
my
dear
and
let
me
hear
talk
let
me
hear
he
again
applied
his
eye
to
the
glass
and
turning
his
ear
to
the
partition
listened
attentively
with
a
subtle
and
eager
look
upon
his
face
that
might
have
appertained
to
some
old
goblin
i
mean
to
be
a
gentleman
said
claypole
kicking
out
his
legs
and
continuing
a
conversation
the
commencement
of
which
fagin
had
arrived
too
late
to
hear
more
jolly
old
coffins
charlotte
but
a
gentleman
life
for
me
and
if
yer
like
yer
shall
be
a
lady
should
like
that
well
enough
dear
replied
charlotte
tills
ai
to
be
emptied
every
day
and
people
to
get
clear
off
after
it
be
blowed
said
claypole
more
things
besides
tills
to
be
emptied
do
you
mean
asked
his
companion
women
ridicules
houses
banks
said
claypole
rising
with
the
porter
you
ca
do
all
that
dear
said
charlotte
shall
look
out
to
get
into
company
with
them
as
can
replied
noah
be
able
to
make
us
useful
some
way
or
another
why
you
yourself
are
worth
fifty
women
i
never
see
such
a
precious
sly
and
deceitful
creetur
as
yer
can
be
when
i
let
yer
how
nice
it
is
to
hear
yer
say
so
exclaimed
charlotte
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
his
ugly
face
that
do
do
yer
be
too
affectionate
in
case
i
cross
with
yer
said
noah
disengaging
himself
with
great
gravity
should
like
to
be
the
captain
of
some
band
and
have
the
whopping
of
and
follering
about
unbeknown
to
themselves
that
would
suit
me
if
there
was
good
profit
and
if
we
could
only
get
in
with
some
gentleman
of
this
sort
i
say
it
would
be
cheap
at
that
note
you
got
especially
as
we
do
very
well
know
how
to
get
rid
of
it
ourselves
after
expressing
this
opinion
claypole
looked
into
the
with
an
aspect
of
deep
wisdom
and
having
well
shaken
its
contents
nodded
condescendingly
to
charlotte
and
took
a
draught
wherewith
he
appeared
greatly
refreshed
he
was
meditating
another
when
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
and
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
interrupted
him
the
stranger
was
fagin
and
very
amiable
he
looked
and
a
very
low
bow
he
made
as
he
advanced
and
setting
himself
down
at
the
nearest
table
ordered
something
to
drink
of
the
grinning
barney
pleasant
night
sir
but
cool
for
the
time
of
year
said
fagin
rubbing
his
hands
the
country
i
see
sir
do
yer
see
that
asked
noah
claypole
have
not
so
much
dust
as
that
in
london
replied
fagin
pointing
from
noah
shoes
to
those
of
his
companion
and
from
them
to
the
two
bundles
a
sharp
feller
said
noah
ha
only
hear
that
charlotte
one
need
be
sharp
in
this
town
my
dear
replied
the
jew
sinking
his
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
that
the
truth
fagin
followed
up
this
remark
by
striking
the
side
of
his
nose
with
his
right
forefinger
a
gesture
which
noah
attempted
to
imitate
though
not
with
complete
success
in
consequence
of
his
own
nose
not
being
large
enough
for
the
purpose
however
fagin
seemed
to
interpret
the
endeavour
as
expressing
a
perfect
coincidence
with
his
opinion
and
put
about
the
liquor
which
barney
reappeared
with
in
a
very
friendly
manner
stuff
that
observed
claypole
smacking
his
lips
said
fagin
man
need
be
always
emptying
a
till
or
a
pocket
or
a
woman
reticule
or
a
house
or
a
or
a
bank
if
he
drinks
it
regularly
claypole
no
sooner
heard
this
extract
from
his
own
remarks
than
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
from
the
jew
to
charlotte
with
a
countenance
of
ashy
paleness
and
excessive
terror
mind
me
my
dear
said
fagin
drawing
his
chair
closer
ha
it
was
lucky
it
was
only
me
that
heard
you
by
chance
it
was
very
lucky
it
was
only
me
did
take
it
stammered
noah
no
longer
stretching
out
his
legs
like
an
independent
gentleman
but
coiling
them
up
as
well
as
he
could
under
his
chair
was
all
her
doing
yer
got
it
now
charlotte
yer
know
yer
have
matter
who
got
it
or
who
did
it
my
dear
replied
fagin
glancing
nevertheless
with
a
hawk
eye
at
the
girl
and
the
two
bundles
in
that
way
myself
and
i
like
you
for
it
what
way
asked
claypole
a
little
recovering
that
way
of
business
rejoined
fagin
so
are
the
people
of
the
house
you
hit
the
right
nail
upon
the
head
and
are
as
safe
here
as
you
could
be
there
is
not
a
safer
place
in
all
this
town
than
is
the
cripples
that
is
when
i
like
to
make
it
so
and
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
you
and
the
young
woman
so
i
said
the
word
and
you
may
make
your
minds
easy
noah
claypole
mind
might
have
been
at
ease
after
this
assurance
but
his
body
certainly
was
not
for
he
shuffled
and
writhed
about
into
various
uncouth
positions
eyeing
his
new
friend
meanwhile
with
mingled
fear
and
suspicion
tell
you
more
said
fagin
after
he
had
reassured
the
girl
by
dint
of
friendly
nods
and
muttered
encouragements
have
got
a
friend
that
i
think
can
gratify
your
darling
wish
and
put
you
in
the
right
way
where
you
can
take
whatever
department
of
the
business
you
think
will
suit
you
best
at
first
and
be
taught
all
the
others
speak
as
if
yer
were
in
earnest
replied
noah
advantage
would
it
be
to
me
to
be
anything
else
inquired
fagin
shrugging
his
shoulders
let
me
have
a
word
with
you
outside
no
occasion
to
trouble
ourselves
to
move
said
noah
getting
his
legs
by
gradual
degrees
abroad
again
take
the
luggage
upstairs
the
while
charlotte
see
to
them
bundles
this
mandate
which
had
been
delivered
with
great
majesty
was
obeyed
without
the
slightest
demur
and
charlotte
made
the
best
of
her
way
off
with
the
packages
while
noah
held
the
door
open
and
watched
her
out
kept
tolerably
well
under
ai
she
he
asked
as
he
resumed
his
seat
in
the
tone
of
a
keeper
who
had
tamed
some
wild
animal
perfect
rejoined
fagin
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
a
genius
my
dear
i
suppose
if
i
was
i
should
be
here
replied
noah
i
say
she
be
back
if
yer
lose
time
what
do
you
think
said
fagin
you
was
to
like
my
friend
could
you
do
better
than
join
him
he
in
a
good
way
of
business
that
where
it
is
responded
noah
winking
one
of
his
little
eyes
top
of
the
tree
employs
a
power
of
hands
has
the
very
best
society
in
the
profession
asked
claypole
a
countryman
among
and
i
do
think
he
take
you
even
on
my
recommendation
if
he
did
run
rather
short
of
assistants
just
now
replied
fagin
i
have
to
hand
over
said
noah
slapping
his
could
possibly
be
done
without
replied
fagin
in
a
most
decided
manner
pound
though
it
a
lot
of
money
when
it
in
a
note
you
ca
get
rid
of
retorted
fagin
and
date
taken
i
suppose
payment
stopped
at
the
bank
ah
it
not
worth
much
to
him
it
have
to
go
abroad
and
he
could
sell
it
for
a
great
deal
in
the
market
could
i
see
him
asked
noah
doubtfully
morning
said
noah
the
wages
like
a
gentleman
board
and
lodging
pipes
and
spirits
free
half
of
all
you
earn
and
half
of
all
the
young
woman
earns
replied
fagin
whether
noah
claypole
whose
rapacity
was
none
of
the
least
comprehensive
would
have
acceded
even
to
these
glowing
terms
had
he
been
a
perfectly
free
agent
is
very
doubtful
but
as
he
recollected
that
in
the
event
of
his
refusal
it
was
in
the
power
of
his
new
acquaintance
to
give
him
up
to
justice
immediately
and
more
unlikely
things
had
come
to
pass
he
gradually
relented
and
said
he
thought
that
would
suit
him
yer
see
observed
noah
she
will
be
able
to
do
a
good
deal
i
should
like
to
take
something
very
light
little
fancy
work
suggested
fagin
something
of
that
sort
replied
noah
do
you
think
would
suit
me
now
something
not
too
trying
for
the
strength
and
not
very
dangerous
you
know
that
the
sort
of
thing
heard
you
talk
of
something
in
the
spy
way
upon
the
others
my
dear
said
fagin
friend
wants
somebody
who
would
do
that
well
very
much
i
did
mention
that
and
i
should
mind
turning
my
hand
to
it
sometimes
rejoined
claypole
slowly
it
would
pay
by
itself
you
know
true
observed
the
jew
ruminating
or
pretending
to
ruminate
it
might
not
do
you
think
then
asked
noah
anxiously
regarding
him
in
the
sneaking
way
where
it
was
pretty
sure
work
and
not
much
more
risk
than
being
at
home
do
you
think
of
the
old
ladies
asked
fagin
a
good
deal
of
money
made
in
snatching
their
bags
and
parcels
and
running
round
the
corner
they
holler
out
a
good
deal
and
scratch
sometimes
asked
noah
shaking
his
head
do
think
that
would
answer
my
purpose
there
any
other
line
open
said
fagin
laying
his
hand
on
noah
knee
kinchin
lay
that
demanded
claypole
kinchins
my
dear
said
fagin
the
young
children
that
sent
on
errands
by
their
mothers
with
sixpences
and
shillings
and
the
lay
is
just
to
take
their
money
away
they
always
got
it
ready
in
their
hands
then
knock
into
the
kennel
and
walk
off
very
slow
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
the
matter
but
a
child
fallen
down
and
hurt
itself
ha
ha
ha
ha
roared
claypole
kicking
up
his
legs
in
an
ecstasy
that
the
very
thing
be
sure
it
is
replied
fagin
you
can
have
a
few
good
beats
chalked
out
in
camden
town
and
battle
bridge
and
neighborhoods
like
that
where
they
always
going
errands
and
you
can
upset
as
many
kinchins
as
you
want
any
hour
in
the
day
ha
ha
ha
with
this
fagin
poked
claypole
in
the
side
and
they
joined
in
a
burst
of
laughter
both
long
and
loud
that
all
right
said
noah
when
he
had
recovered
himself
and
charlotte
had
returned
time
shall
we
say
ten
do
asked
fagin
adding
as
claypole
nodded
assent
name
shall
i
tell
my
good
friend
bolter
replied
noah
who
had
prepared
himself
for
such
emergency
morris
bolter
this
is
mrs
bolter
bolter
humble
servant
said
fagin
bowing
with
grotesque
politeness
hope
i
shall
know

claypole
noah

replied
bolter
extending
her
hand
calls
me
noah
as
a
sort
of
fond
way
of
talking
said
morris
bolter
late
claypole
turning
to
fagin
understand
yes
i
understand
perfectly
replied
fagin
telling
the
truth
for
once
with
many
adieus
and
good
wishes
fagin
went
his
way
noah
claypole
bespeaking
his
good
lady
attention
proceeded
to
enlighten
her
relative
to
the
arrangement
he
had
made
with
all
that
haughtiness
and
air
of
superiority
becoming
not
only
a
member
of
the
sterner
sex
but
a
gentleman
who
appreciated
the
dignity
of
a
special
appointment
on
the
kinchin
lay
in
london
and
its
vicinity
chapter
xliii
wherein
is
shown
how
the
artful
dodger
got
into
trouble
so
it
was
you
that
was
your
own
friend
was
it
asked
claypole
otherwise
bolter
when
by
virtue
of
the
compact
entered
into
between
them
he
had
removed
next
day
to
fagin
house
i
thought
as
much
last
night
man
his
own
friend
my
dear
replied
fagin
with
his
most
insinuating
grin
has
as
good
a
one
as
himself
anywhere
sometimes
replied
morris
bolter
assuming
the
air
of
a
man
of
the
world
people
are
nobody
enemies
but
their
own
yer
know
believe
that
said
fagin
a
man
his
own
enemy
only
because
he
too
much
his
own
friend
not
because
he
careful
for
everybody
but
himself
pooh
pooh
there
ai
such
a
thing
in
nature
ough
to
be
if
there
is
replied
bolter
stands
to
reason
some
conjurers
say
that
number
three
is
the
magic
number
and
some
say
number
seven
it
neither
my
friend
neither
it
number
one
ha
cried
bolter
one
for
ever
a
little
community
like
ours
my
dear
said
fagin
who
felt
it
necessary
to
qualify
this
position
have
a
general
number
one
without
considering
me
too
as
the
same
and
all
the
other
young
people
the
devil
exclaimed
bolter
see
pursued
fagin
affecting
to
disregard
this
interruption
are
so
mixed
up
together
and
identified
in
our
interests
that
it
must
be
so
for
instance
it
your
object
to
take
care
of
number
one
meaning
yourself
replied
bolter
about
right
there
you
ca
take
care
of
yourself
number
one
without
taking
care
of
me
number
one
two
you
mean
said
bolter
who
was
largely
endowed
with
the
quality
of
selfishness
i
do
retorted
fagin
of
the
same
importance
to
you
as
you
are
to
yourself
say
interrupted
bolter
a
very
nice
man
and
i
very
fond
of
yer
but
we
ai
quite
so
thick
together
as
all
that
comes
to
think
said
fagin
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
stretching
out
his
hands
consider
you
done
what
a
very
pretty
thing
and
what
i
love
you
for
doing
but
what
at
the
same
time
would
put
the
cravat
round
your
throat
that
so
very
easily
tied
and
so
very
difficult
to
unloose
in
plain
english
the
halter
bolter
put
his
hand
to
his
neckerchief
as
if
he
felt
it
inconveniently
tight
and
murmured
an
assent
qualified
in
tone
but
not
in
substance
gallows
continued
fagin
gallows
my
dear
is
an
ugly
which
points
out
a
very
short
and
sharp
turning
that
has
stopped
many
a
bold
fellow
career
on
the
broad
highway
to
keep
in
the
easy
road
and
keep
it
at
a
distance
is
object
number
one
with
you
course
it
is
replied
bolter
do
yer
talk
about
such
things
for
to
show
you
my
meaning
clearly
said
the
jew
raising
his
eyebrows
be
able
to
do
that
you
depend
upon
me
to
keep
my
little
business
all
snug
i
depend
upon
you
the
first
is
your
number
one
the
second
my
number
one
the
more
you
value
your
number
one
the
more
careful
you
must
be
of
mine
so
we
come
at
last
to
what
i
told
you
at
first
that
a
regard
for
number
one
holds
us
all
together
and
must
do
so
unless
we
would
all
go
to
pieces
in
company
true
rejoined
bolter
thoughtfully
yer
a
cunning
old
codger
fagin
saw
with
delight
that
this
tribute
to
his
powers
was
no
mere
compliment
but
that
he
had
really
impressed
his
recruit
with
a
sense
of
his
wily
genius
which
it
was
most
important
that
he
should
entertain
in
the
outset
of
their
acquaintance
to
strengthen
an
impression
so
desirable
and
useful
he
followed
up
the
blow
by
acquainting
him
in
some
detail
with
the
magnitude
and
extent
of
his
operations
blending
truth
and
fiction
together
as
best
served
his
purpose
and
bringing
both
to
bear
with
so
much
art
that
respect
visibly
increased
and
became
tempered
at
the
same
time
with
a
degree
of
wholesome
fear
which
it
was
highly
desirable
to
awaken
this
mutual
trust
we
have
in
each
other
that
consoles
me
under
heavy
losses
said
fagin
best
hand
was
taken
from
me
yesterday
morning
do
mean
to
say
he
died
cried
bolter
no
replied
fagin
so
bad
as
that
not
quite
so
bad
i
suppose
he
was
interposed
fagin
he
was
wanted
particular
inquired
bolter
replied
fagin
very
he
was
charged
with
attempting
to
pick
a
pocket
and
they
found
a
silver
on
him
his
own
my
dear
his
own
for
he
took
snuff
himself
and
was
very
fond
of
it
they
remanded
him
till
for
they
thought
they
knew
the
owner
ah
he
was
worth
fifty
boxes
and
i
give
the
price
of
as
many
to
have
him
back
you
should
have
known
the
dodger
my
dear
you
should
have
known
the
dodger
but
i
shall
know
him
i
hope
do
yer
think
so
said
bolter
doubtful
about
it
replied
fagin
with
a
sigh
they
get
any
fresh
evidence
it
only
be
a
summary
conviction
and
we
shall
have
him
back
again
after
six
weeks
or
so
but
if
they
do
a
case
of
lagging
they
know
what
a
clever
lad
he
is
he
be
a
lifer
they
make
the
artful
nothing
less
than
a
lifer
do
you
mean
by
lagging
and
a
lifer
demanded
bolter
the
good
of
talking
in
that
way
to
me
why
do
yer
speak
so
as
i
can
understand
yer
fagin
was
about
to
translate
these
mysterious
expressions
into
the
vulgar
tongue
and
being
interpreted
bolter
would
have
been
informed
that
they
represented
that
combination
of
words
for
life
when
the
dialogue
was
cut
short
by
the
entry
of
master
bates
with
his
hands
in
his
and
his
face
twisted
into
a
look
of
woe
all
up
fagin
said
charley
when
he
and
his
new
companion
had
been
made
known
to
each
other
do
you
mean
found
the
gentleman
as
owns
the
box
two
or
three
more
a
coming
to
him
and
the
artful
booked
for
a
passage
out
replied
master
bates
must
have
a
full
suit
of
mourning
fagin
and
a
hatband
to
wisit
him
in
afore
he
sets
out
upon
his
travels
to
think
of
jack
dawkins
lummy
jack
the
dodger
the
artful
dodger
going
abroad
for
a
common
i
never
thought
he
a
done
it
under
a
gold
watch
chain
and
seals
at
the
lowest
oh
why
did
he
rob
some
rich
old
gentleman
of
all
his
walables
and
go
out
as
a
gentleman
and
not
like
a
common
prig
without
no
honour
nor
glory
with
this
expression
of
feeling
for
his
unfortunate
friend
master
bates
sat
himself
on
the
nearest
chair
with
an
aspect
of
chagrin
and
despondency
do
you
talk
about
his
having
neither
honour
nor
glory
for
exclaimed
fagin
darting
an
angry
look
at
his
pupil
he
always
the
among
you
all
is
there
one
of
you
that
could
touch
him
or
come
near
him
on
any
scent
eh
one
replied
master
bates
in
a
voice
rendered
husky
by
regret
one
what
do
you
talk
of
replied
fagin
angrily
are
you
blubbering
for
it
is
on
the
is
it
said
charley
chafed
into
perfect
defiance
of
his
venerable
friend
by
the
current
of
his
regrets
it
ca
come
out
in
the
nobody
will
never
know
half
of
what
he
was
how
will
he
stand
in
the
newgate
calendar
not
be
there
at
all
oh
my
eye
my
eye
wot
a
blow
it
is
ha
cried
fagin
extending
his
right
hand
and
turning
to
bolter
in
a
fit
of
chuckling
which
shook
him
as
though
he
had
the
palsy
what
a
pride
they
take
in
their
profession
my
dear
it
beautiful
bolter
nodded
assent
and
fagin
after
contemplating
the
grief
of
charley
bates
for
some
seconds
with
evident
satisfaction
stepped
up
to
that
young
gentleman
and
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
mind
charley
said
fagin
soothingly
come
out
it
be
sure
to
come
out
they
all
know
what
a
clever
fellow
he
was
show
it
himself
and
not
disgrace
his
old
pals
and
teachers
think
how
young
he
is
too
what
a
distinction
charley
to
be
lagged
at
his
time
of
life
it
is
a
honour
that
is
said
charley
a
little
consoled
shall
have
all
he
wants
continued
the
jew
shall
be
kept
in
the
stone
jug
charley
like
a
gentleman
like
a
gentleman
with
his
beer
every
day
and
money
in
his
pocket
to
pitch
and
toss
with
if
he
ca
spend
it
shall
he
though
cried
charley
bates
that
he
shall
replied
fagin
we
have
a
charley
one
that
got
the
greatest
gift
of
the
gab
to
carry
on
his
defence
and
he
shall
make
a
speech
for
himself
too
if
he
likes
and
we
read
it
all
in
the
papers
artful
dodger
shrieks
of
laughter
here
the
court
was
convulsed
eh
charley
eh
ha
laughed
master
bates
a
lark
that
would
be
it
fagin
i
say
how
the
artful
would
bother
would
he
cried
fagin
shall
he
will
to
be
sure
so
he
will
repeated
charley
rubbing
his
hands
think
i
see
him
now
cried
the
jew
bending
his
eyes
upon
his
pupil
do
i
cried
charley
bates
ha
ha
so
do
i
see
it
all
afore
me
upon
my
soul
i
do
fagin
what
a
game
what
a
regular
game
all
the
trying
to
look
solemn
and
jack
dawkins
addressing
of
as
intimate
and
comfortable
as
if
he
was
the
judge
own
son
making
a
speech
arter
dinner
ha
ha
ha
in
fact
fagin
had
so
well
humoured
his
young
friend
eccentric
disposition
that
master
bates
who
had
at
first
been
disposed
to
consider
the
imprisoned
dodger
rather
in
the
light
of
a
victim
now
looked
upon
him
as
the
chief
actor
in
a
scene
of
most
uncommon
and
exquisite
humour
and
felt
quite
impatient
for
the
arrival
of
the
time
when
his
old
companion
should
have
so
favourable
an
opportunity
of
displaying
his
abilities
must
know
how
he
gets
on
by
some
handy
means
or
other
said
fagin
me
think
i
go
asked
charley
for
the
world
replied
fagin
you
mad
my
dear
stark
mad
that
you
walk
into
the
very
place
where
no
charley
no
one
is
enough
to
lose
at
a
time
do
mean
to
go
yourself
i
suppose
said
charley
with
a
humorous
leer
would
quite
fit
replied
fagin
shaking
his
head
why
do
you
send
this
new
cove
asked
master
bates
laying
his
hand
on
noah
arm
knows
him
if
he
did
mind
observed
fagin
interposed
charley
should
he
have
to
mind
nothing
my
dear
said
fagin
turning
to
bolter
nothing
i
dare
say
about
that
yer
know
observed
noah
backing
towards
the
door
and
shaking
his
head
with
a
kind
of
sober
alarm
no
none
of
that
it
not
in
my
department
that
ai
department
has
he
got
fagin
inquired
master
bates
surveying
noah
lank
form
with
much
disgust
cutting
away
when
anything
wrong
and
the
eating
all
the
wittles
when
there
everything
right
is
that
his
branch
mind
retorted
bolter
do
yer
take
liberties
with
yer
superiors
little
boy
or
yer
find
yerself
in
the
wrong
shop
master
bates
laughed
so
vehemently
at
this
magnificent
threat
that
it
was
some
time
before
fagin
could
interpose
and
represent
to
bolter
that
he
incurred
no
possible
danger
in
visiting
the
that
inasmuch
as
no
account
of
the
little
affair
in
which
he
had
engaged
nor
any
description
of
his
person
had
yet
been
forwarded
to
the
metropolis
it
was
very
probable
that
he
was
not
even
suspected
of
having
resorted
to
it
for
shelter
and
that
if
he
were
properly
disguised
it
would
be
as
safe
a
spot
for
him
to
visit
as
any
in
london
inasmuch
as
it
would
be
of
all
places
the
very
last
to
which
he
could
be
supposed
likely
to
resort
of
his
own
free
will
persuaded
in
part
by
these
representations
but
overborne
in
a
much
greater
degree
by
his
fear
of
fagin
bolter
at
length
consented
with
a
very
bad
grace
to
undertake
the
expedition
by
directions
he
immediately
substituted
for
his
own
attire
a
frock
velveteen
breeches
and
leather
leggings
all
of
which
articles
the
jew
had
at
hand
he
was
likewise
furnished
with
a
felt
hat
well
garnished
with
turnpike
tickets
and
a
carter
whip
thus
equipped
he
was
to
saunter
into
the
office
as
some
country
fellow
from
covent
garden
market
might
be
supposed
to
do
for
the
gratification
of
his
curiousity
and
as
he
was
as
awkward
ungainly
and
a
fellow
as
need
be
fagin
had
no
fear
but
that
he
would
look
the
part
to
perfection
these
arrangements
completed
he
was
informed
of
the
necessary
signs
and
tokens
by
which
to
recognise
the
artful
dodger
and
was
conveyed
by
master
bates
through
dark
and
winding
ways
to
within
a
very
short
distance
of
bow
street
having
described
the
precise
situation
of
the
office
and
accompanied
it
with
copious
directions
how
he
was
to
walk
straight
up
the
passage
and
when
he
got
into
the
side
and
pull
off
his
hat
as
he
went
into
the
room
charley
bates
bade
him
hurry
on
alone
and
promised
to
bide
his
return
on
the
spot
of
their
parting
noah
claypole
or
morris
bolter
as
the
reader
pleases
punctually
followed
the
directions
he
had
received
which
master
bates
being
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
locality
were
so
exact
that
he
was
enabled
to
gain
the
magisterial
presence
without
asking
any
question
or
meeting
with
any
interruption
by
the
way
he
found
himself
jostled
among
a
crowd
of
people
chiefly
women
who
were
huddled
together
in
a
dirty
frowsy
room
at
the
upper
end
of
which
was
a
raised
platform
railed
off
from
the
rest
with
a
dock
for
the
prisoners
on
the
left
hand
against
the
wall
a
box
for
the
witnesses
in
the
middle
and
a
desk
for
the
magistrates
on
the
right
the
awful
locality
last
named
being
screened
off
by
a
partition
which
concealed
the
bench
from
the
common
gaze
and
left
the
vulgar
to
imagine
if
they
could
the
full
majesty
of
justice
there
were
only
a
couple
of
women
in
the
dock
who
were
nodding
to
their
admiring
friends
while
the
clerk
read
some
depositions
to
a
couple
of
policemen
and
a
man
in
plain
clothes
who
leant
over
the
table
a
jailer
stood
reclining
against
the
tapping
his
nose
listlessly
with
a
large
key
except
when
he
repressed
an
undue
tendency
to
conversation
among
the
idlers
by
proclaiming
silence
or
looked
sternly
up
to
bid
some
woman
that
baby
out
when
the
gravity
of
justice
was
disturbed
by
feeble
cries
in
the
mother
shawl
from
some
meagre
infant
the
room
smelt
close
and
unwholesome
the
walls
were
and
the
ceiling
blackened
there
was
an
old
smoky
bust
over
the
and
a
dusty
clock
above
the
dock
the
only
thing
present
that
seemed
to
go
on
as
it
ought
for
depravity
or
poverty
or
an
habitual
acquaintance
with
both
had
left
a
taint
on
all
the
animate
matter
hardly
less
unpleasant
than
the
thick
greasy
scum
on
every
inanimate
object
that
frowned
upon
it
noah
looked
eagerly
about
him
for
the
dodger
but
although
there
were
several
women
who
would
have
done
very
well

more
than

might
be

to
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
father
nobody
at
all
answering
the
description
given
him
of
dawkins
was
to
be
seen
he
waited
in
a
state
of
much
suspense
and
uncertainty
until
the
women
being
committed
for
trial
went
flaunting
out
and
then
was
quickly
relieved
by
the
appearance
of
another
prisoner
who
he
felt
at
once
could
be
no
other
than
the
object
of
his
visit
it
was
indeed
dawkins
who
shuffling
into
the
office
with
the
big
coat
sleeves
tucked
up
as
usual
his
left
hand
in
his
pocket
and
his
hat
in
his
right
hand
preceded
the
jailer
with
a
rolling
gait
altogether
indescribable
and
taking
his
place
in
the
dock
requested
in
an
audible
voice
to
know
what
he
was
placed
in
that
disgraceful
sitivation
for
your
tongue
will
you
said
the
jailer
an
englishman
ai
i
rejoined
the
dodger

my
priwileges

your
privileges
soon
enough
retorted
the
jailer
pepper
with
see
wot
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
home
affairs
has
got
to
say
to
the
beaks
if
i

replied
dawkins
then

this
here
business
i
shall
thank

here
little
affair
and
not
to
keep
me
while
they
read
the
paper
for

got
an
appointment
with
a
genelman
in
the
city
and
as
i

a
man
of
my

if

ai

to
my
time
and
then
ther
wo
be
an
action
for
damage
against
them
as
kep
me
away
oh
no
certainly
not
at
this
point
the
dodger
with
a
show
of
being
very
particular
with
a
view
to
proceedings
to
be
had
thereafter
desired
the
jailer
to
communicate
names
of
them
two
files
as
was
on
the
bench
which
so
tickled
the
spectators
that
they
laughed
almost
as
heartily
as
master
bates
could
have
done
if
he
had
heard
the
request
there
cried
the
jailer
is
this
inquired
one
of
the
magistrates
case
your
worship
the
boy
ever
been
here
before
ought
to
have
been
a
many
times
replied
the
jailer
has
been
pretty
well
everywhere
else
know
him
well
your
worship
you
know
me
do
you
cried
the
artful
making
a
note
of
the
statement
good
that
a
case
of
deformation
of
character
any
way
here
there
was
another
laugh
and
another
cry
of
silence
then
where
are
the
witnesses
said
the
clerk
that
right
added
the
dodger
are
they
i
should
like
to
see
this
wish
was
immediately
gratified
for
a
policeman
stepped
forward
who
had
seen
the
prisoner
attempt
the
pocket
of
an
unknown
gentleman
in
a
crowd
and
indeed
take
a
handkerchief
therefrom
which
being
a
very
old
one
he
deliberately
put
back
again
after
trying
it
on
his
own
countenance
for
this
reason
he
took
the
dodger
into
custody
as
soon
as
he
could
get
near
him
and
the
said
dodger
being
searched
had
upon
his
person
a
silver
with
the
owner
name
engraved
upon
the
lid
this
gentleman
had
been
discovered
on
reference
to
the
court
guide
and
being
then
and
there
present
swore
that
the
was
his
and
that
he
had
missed
it
on
the
previous
day
the
moment
he
had
disengaged
himself
from
the
crowd
before
referred
to
he
had
also
remarked
a
young
gentleman
in
the
throng
particularly
active
in
making
his
way
about
and
that
young
gentleman
was
the
prisoner
before
him
you
anything
to
ask
this
witness
boy
said
the
magistrate
would
abase
myself
by
descending
to
hold
no
conversation
with
him
replied
the
dodger
you
anything
to
say
at
all
you
hear
his
worship
ask
if
you
anything
to
say
inquired
the
jailer
nudging
the
silent
dodger
with
his
elbow
beg
your
pardon
said
the
dodger
looking
up
with
an
air
of
abstraction
you
redress
yourself
to
me
my
man
never
see
such
an
young
wagabond
your
worship
observed
the
officer
with
a
grin
you
mean
to
say
anything
you
young
shaver
replied
the
dodger
here
for
this
ai
the
shop
for
justice
besides
which
my
attorney
is
this
morning
with
the
wice
president
of
the
house
of
commons
but
i
shall
have
something
to
say
elsewhere
and
so
will
he
and
so
will
a
wery
numerous
and
circle
of
acquaintance
as
make
them
beaks
wish
never
been
born
or
that
they
got
their
footmen
to
hang
up
to
their
own
afore
they
let
come
out
this
morning
to
try
it
on
upon
me
i
he
fully
committed
interposed
the
clerk
him
away
on
said
the
jailer
ah
i
come
on
replied
the
dodger
brushing
his
hat
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
to
the
bench
it
no
use
your
looking
frightened
i
wo
show
you
no
mercy
not
a
of
it
pay
for
this
my
fine
fellers
i
would
be
you
for
something
i
would
go
free
now
if
you
was
to
fall
down
on
your
knees
and
ask
me
here
carry
me
off
to
prison
take
me
away
with
these
last
words
the
dodger
suffered
himself
to
be
led
off
by
the
collar
threatening
till
he
got
into
the
yard
to
make
a
parliamentary
business
of
it
and
then
grinning
in
the
officer
face
with
great
glee
and
having
seen
him
locked
up
by
himself
in
a
little
cell
noah
made
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
where
he
had
left
master
bates
after
waiting
here
some
time
he
was
joined
by
that
young
gentleman
who
had
prudently
abstained
from
showing
himself
until
he
had
looked
carefully
abroad
from
a
snug
retreat
and
ascertained
that
his
new
friend
had
not
been
followed
by
any
impertinent
person
the
two
hastened
back
together
to
bear
to
fagin
the
animating
news
that
the
dodger
was
doing
full
justice
to
his
and
establishing
for
himself
a
glorious
reputation
chapter
xliv
the
time
arrives
for
nancy
to
redeem
her
pledge
to
rose
maylie
she
fails
adept
as
she
was
in
all
the
arts
of
cunning
and
dissimulation
the
girl
nancy
could
not
wholly
conceal
the
effect
which
the
knowledge
of
the
step
she
had
taken
wrought
upon
her
mind
she
remembered
that
both
the
crafty
jew
and
the
brutal
sikes
had
confided
to
her
schemes
which
had
been
hidden
from
all
others
in
the
full
confidence
that
she
was
trustworthy
and
beyond
the
reach
of
their
suspicion
vile
as
those
schemes
were
desperate
as
were
their
originators
and
bitter
as
were
her
feelings
towards
fagin
who
had
led
her
step
by
step
deeper
and
deeper
down
into
an
abyss
of
crime
and
misery
whence
was
no
escape
still
there
were
times
when
even
towards
him
she
felt
some
relenting
lest
her
disclosure
should
bring
him
within
the
iron
grasp
he
had
so
long
eluded
and
he
should
fall
at
last
richly
as
he
merited
such
a
fate
by
her
hand
but
these
were
the
mere
wanderings
of
a
mind
unable
wholly
to
detach
itself
from
old
companions
and
associations
though
enabled
to
fix
itself
steadily
on
one
object
and
resolved
not
to
be
turned
aside
by
any
consideration
her
fears
for
sikes
would
have
been
more
powerful
inducements
to
recoil
while
there
was
yet
time
but
she
had
stipulated
that
her
secret
should
be
rigidly
kept
she
had
dropped
no
clue
which
could
lead
to
his
discovery
she
had
refused
even
for
his
sake
a
refuge
from
all
the
guilt
and
wretchedness
that
encompasses
her
and
what
more
could
she
do
she
was
resolved
though
all
her
mental
struggles
terminated
in
this
conclusion
they
forced
themselves
upon
her
again
and
again
and
left
their
traces
too
she
grew
pale
and
thin
even
within
a
few
days
at
times
she
took
no
heed
of
what
was
passing
before
her
or
no
part
in
conversations
where
once
she
would
have
been
the
loudest
at
other
times
she
laughed
without
merriment
and
was
noisy
without
a
moment
afterwards
she
sat
silent
and
dejected
brooding
with
her
head
upon
her
hands
while
the
very
effort
by
which
she
roused
herself
told
more
forcibly
than
even
these
indications
that
she
was
ill
at
ease
and
that
her
thoughts
were
occupied
with
matters
very
different
and
distant
from
those
in
the
course
of
discussion
by
her
companions
it
was
sunday
night
and
the
bell
of
the
nearest
church
struck
the
hour
sikes
and
the
jew
were
talking
but
they
paused
to
listen
the
girl
looked
up
from
the
low
seat
on
which
she
crouched
and
listened
too
eleven
hour
this
side
of
midnight
said
sikes
raising
the
blind
to
look
out
and
returning
to
his
seat
and
heavy
it
is
too
a
good
night
for
business
this
replied
fagin
a
pity
bill
my
dear
that
there
none
quite
ready
to
be
done
right
for
once
replied
sikes
gruffly
is
a
pity
for
in
the
humour
too
fagin
sighed
and
shook
his
head
despondingly
must
make
up
for
lost
time
when
we
got
things
into
a
good
train
that
all
i
know
said
sikes
the
way
to
talk
my
dear
replied
fagin
venturing
to
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
does
me
good
to
hear
you
you
good
does
it
cried
sikes
so
be
it
ha
ha
laughed
fagin
as
if
he
were
relieved
by
even
this
concession
like
yourself
bill
quite
like
yourself
do
feel
like
myself
when
you
lay
that
withered
old
claw
on
my
shoulder
so
take
it
away
said
sikes
casting
off
the
jew
hand
make
you
nervous
bill
reminds
you
of
being
nabbed
does
it
said
fagin
determined
not
to
be
offended
me
of
being
nabbed
by
the
devil
returned
sikes
never
was
another
man
with
such
a
face
as
yours
unless
it
was
your
father
and
i
suppose
is
singeing
his
grizzled
red
beard
by
this
time
unless
you
came
straight
from
the
old
without
any
father
at
all
betwixt
you
which
i
should
wonder
at
a
bit
fagin
offered
no
reply
to
this
compliment
but
pulling
sikes
by
the
sleeve
pointed
his
finger
towards
nancy
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
foregoing
conversation
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
was
now
leaving
the
room
cried
sikes
where
the
gal
going
to
at
this
time
of
night
far
answer
that
retorted
sikes
you
hear
me
do
know
where
replied
the
girl
i
do
said
sikes
more
in
the
spirit
of
obstinacy
than
because
he
had
any
real
objection
to
the
girl
going
where
she
listed
sit
down
not
well
i
told
you
that
before
rejoined
the
girl
want
a
breath
of
air
your
head
out
of
the
winder
replied
sikes
not
enough
there
said
the
girl
want
it
in
the
street
you
wo
have
it
replied
sikes
with
which
assurance
he
rose
locked
the
door
took
the
key
out
and
pulling
her
bonnet
from
her
head
flung
it
up
to
the
top
of
an
old
press
said
the
robber
stop
quietly
where
you
are
will
you
not
such
a
matter
as
a
bonnet
would
keep
me
said
the
girl
turning
very
pale
do
you
mean
bill
do
you
know
what
doing
what
i
oh
cried
sikes
turning
to
fagin
out
of
her
senses
you
know
or
she
dare
talk
to
me
in
that
way
drive
me
on
the
something
desperate
muttered
the
girl
placing
both
hands
upon
her
breast
as
though
to
keep
down
by
force
some
violent
outbreak
me
go
will
you
this
minute
this
instant
said
sikes
him
to
let
me
go
fagin
he
had
better
it
be
better
for
him
do
you
hear
me
cried
nancy
stamping
her
foot
upon
the
ground
you
repeated
sikes
turning
round
in
his
chair
to
confront
her
and
if
i
hear
you
for
half
a
minute
longer
the
dog
shall
have
such
a
grip
on
your
throat
as
tear
some
of
that
screaming
voice
out
wot
has
come
over
you
you
jade
wot
is
it
me
go
said
the
girl
with
great
earnestness
then
sitting
herself
down
on
the
floor
before
the
door
she
said
let
me
go
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
you
do
indeed
for
only
one
hour
do
do
my
limbs
off
one
by
one
cried
sikes
seizing
her
roughly
by
the
arm
i
do
think
the
gal
stark
raving
mad
get
up
till
you
let
me
go
not
till
you
let
me
go
never
never
screamed
the
girl
sikes
looked
on
for
a
minute
watching
his
opportunity
and
suddenly
pinioning
her
hands
dragged
her
struggling
and
wrestling
with
him
by
the
way
into
a
small
room
adjoining
where
he
sat
himself
on
a
bench
and
thrusting
her
into
a
chair
held
her
down
by
force
she
struggled
and
implored
by
turns
until
twelve
had
struck
and
then
wearied
and
exhausted
ceased
to
contest
the
point
any
further
with
a
caution
backed
by
many
oaths
to
make
no
more
efforts
to
go
out
that
night
sikes
left
her
to
recover
at
leisure
and
rejoined
fagin
said
the
housebreaker
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
a
precious
strange
gal
that
is
may
say
that
bill
replied
fagin
thoughtfully
may
say
that
did
she
take
it
into
her
head
to
go
out
for
do
you
think
asked
sikes
you
should
know
her
better
than
me
wot
does
it
mean
woman
obstinacy
i
suppose
my
dear
i
suppose
it
is
growled
sikes
thought
i
had
tamed
her
but
she
as
bad
as
ever
said
fagin
thoughtfully
never
knew
her
like
this
for
such
a
little
cause
i
said
sikes
think
she
got
a
touch
of
that
fever
in
her
blood
yet
and
it
wo
come
out
eh
enough
let
her
a
little
blood
without
troubling
the
doctor
if
took
that
way
again
said
sikes
fagin
nodded
an
expressive
approval
of
this
mode
of
treatment
was
hanging
about
me
all
day
and
night
too
when
i
was
stretched
on
my
back
and
you
like
a
blackhearted
wolf
as
you
are
kept
yourself
aloof
said
sikes
was
poor
too
all
the
time
and
i
think
one
way
or
other
it
worried
and
fretted
her
and
that
being
shut
up
here
so
long
has
made
her
restless
eh
it
my
dear
replied
the
jew
in
a
whisper
as
he
uttered
these
words
the
girl
herself
appeared
and
resumed
her
former
seat
her
eyes
were
swollen
and
red
she
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
tossed
her
head
and
after
a
little
time
burst
out
laughing
now
she
on
the
other
tack
exclaimed
sikes
turning
a
look
of
excessive
surprise
on
his
companion
fagin
nodded
to
him
to
take
no
further
notice
just
then
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
girl
subsided
into
her
accustomed
demeanour
whispering
sikes
that
there
was
no
fear
of
her
relapsing
fagin
took
up
his
hat
and
bade
him
he
paused
when
he
reached
the
and
looking
round
asked
if
somebody
would
light
him
down
the
dark
stairs
him
down
said
sikes
who
was
filling
his
pipe
a
pity
he
should
break
his
neck
himself
and
disappoint
the
show
him
a
light
nancy
followed
the
old
man
downstairs
with
a
candle
when
they
reached
the
passage
he
laid
his
finger
on
his
lip
and
drawing
close
to
the
girl
said
in
a
whisper
is
it
nancy
dear
do
you
mean
replied
the
girl
in
the
same
tone
reason
of
all
this
replied
fagin
he
pointed
with
his
skinny
up
the
stairs
so
hard
with
you
he
a
brute
nance
a
why
do
you
said
the
girl
as
fagin
paused
with
his
mouth
almost
touching
her
ear
and
his
eyes
looking
into
hers
matter
just
now
we
talk
of
this
again
you
have
a
friend
in
me
nance
a
staunch
friend
i
have
the
means
at
hand
quiet
and
close
if
you
want
revenge
on
those
that
treat
you
like
a
dog
like
a
dog
worse
than
his
dog
for
he
humours
him
sometimes
come
to
me
i
say
come
to
me
he
is
the
mere
hound
of
a
day
but
you
know
me
of
old
nance
know
you
well
replied
the
girl
without
manifesting
the
least
emotion
she
shrank
back
as
fagin
offered
to
lay
his
hand
on
hers
but
said
again
in
a
steady
voice
and
answering
his
parting
look
with
a
nod
of
intelligence
closed
the
door
between
them
fagin
walked
towards
his
home
intent
upon
the
thoughts
that
were
working
within
his
brain
he
had
conceived
the
idea
not
from
what
had
just
passed
though
that
had
tended
to
confirm
him
but
slowly
and
by
degrees
that
nancy
wearied
of
the
housebreaker
brutality
had
conceived
an
attachment
for
some
new
friend
her
altered
manner
her
repeated
absences
from
home
alone
her
comparative
indifference
to
the
interests
of
the
gang
for
which
she
had
once
been
so
zealous
and
added
to
these
her
desperate
impatience
to
leave
home
that
night
at
a
particular
hour
all
favoured
the
supposition
and
rendered
it
to
him
at
least
almost
matter
of
certainty
the
object
of
this
new
liking
was
not
among
his
myrmidons
he
would
be
a
valuable
acquisition
with
such
an
assistant
as
nancy
and
must
thus
fagin
argued
be
secured
without
delay
there
was
another
and
a
darker
object
to
be
gained
sikes
knew
too
much
and
his
ruffian
taunts
had
not
galled
fagin
the
less
because
the
wounds
were
hidden
the
girl
must
know
well
that
if
she
shook
him
off
she
could
never
be
safe
from
his
fury
and
that
it
would
be
surely
wreaked
to
the
maiming
of
limbs
or
perhaps
the
loss
of
life
on
the
object
of
her
more
recent
fancy
a
little
persuasion
thought
fagin
more
likely
than
that
she
would
consent
to
poison
him
women
have
done
such
things
and
worse
to
secure
the
same
object
before
now
there
would
be
the
dangerous
villain
the
man
i
hate
gone
another
secured
in
his
place
and
my
influence
over
the
girl
with
a
knowledge
of
this
crime
to
back
it
unlimited
these
things
passed
through
the
mind
of
fagin
during
the
short
time
he
sat
alone
in
the
housebreaker
room
and
with
them
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
afterwards
afforded
him
of
sounding
the
girl
in
the
broken
hints
he
threw
out
at
parting
there
was
no
expression
of
surprise
no
assumption
of
an
inability
to
understand
his
meaning
the
girl
clearly
comprehended
it
her
glance
at
parting
showed
but
perhaps
she
would
recoil
from
a
plot
to
take
the
life
of
sikes
and
that
was
one
of
the
chief
ends
to
be
attained
thought
fagin
as
he
crept
homeward
i
increase
my
influence
with
her
what
new
power
can
i
acquire
such
brains
are
fertile
in
expedients
if
without
extracting
a
confession
from
herself
he
laid
a
watch
discovered
the
object
of
her
altered
regard
and
threatened
to
reveal
the
whole
history
to
sikes
of
whom
she
stood
in
no
common
fear
unless
she
entered
into
his
designs
could
he
not
secure
her
compliance
can
said
fagin
almost
aloud
durst
not
refuse
me
then
not
for
her
life
not
for
her
life
i
have
it
all
the
means
are
ready
and
shall
be
set
to
work
i
shall
have
you
yet
he
cast
back
a
dark
look
and
a
threatening
motion
of
the
hand
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
left
the
bolder
villain
and
went
on
his
way
busying
his
bony
hands
in
the
folds
of
his
tattered
garment
which
he
wrenched
tightly
in
his
grasp
as
though
there
were
a
hated
enemy
crushed
with
every
motion
of
his
fingers

the
old

was
up
betimes
next
morning
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
appearance
of
his
new
associate
who
after
a
delay
that
seemed
interminable
at
length
presented
himself
and
commenced
a
voracious
assault
on

there

indeed
no

of

heartily
and
bolter
having
had
his
laugh
out
took
a

of
large
bites

much
as

what

said
fagin
keep
ready
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
that
night
and
the
next
and
the
next
again
the
spy
sat
booted
and
equipped
in
his
carter
dress
ready
to
turn
out
at
a
word
from
fagin
six
nights
passed
six
long
weary
nights
and
on
each
fagin
came
home
with
a
disappointed
face
and
briefly
intimated
that
it
was
not
yet
time
on
the
seventh
he
returned
earlier
and
with
an
exultation
he
could
not
conceal
it
was
sunday
goes
abroad
said
fagin
on
the
right
errand
sure
for
she
has
been
alone
all
day
and
the
man
she
is
afraid
of
will
not
be
back
much
before
daybreak
come
with
me
quick
noah
started
up
without
saying
a
word
for
the
jew
was
in
a
state
of
such
intense
excitement
that
it
infected
him
they
left
the
house
stealthily
and
hurrying
through
a
labyrinth
of
streets
arrived
at
length
before
a
which
noah
recognised
as
the
same
in
which
he
had
slept
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
in
london
it
was
past
eleven
and
the
door
was
closed
it
opened
softly
on
its
hinges
as
fagin
gave
a
low
whistle
they
entered
without
noise
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
scarcely
venturing
to
whisper
but
substituting
dumb
show
for
words
fagin
and
the
young
jew
who
had
admitted
them
pointed
out
the
pane
of
glass
to
noah
and
signed
to
him
to
climb
up
and
observe
the
person
in
the
adjoining
room
that
the
woman
he
asked
scarcely
above
his
breath
fagin
nodded
yes
ca
see
her
face
well
whispered
noah
is
looking
down
and
the
candle
is
behind
her
there
whispered
fagin
he
signed
to
barney
who
withdrew
in
an
instant
the
lad
entered
the
room
adjoining
and
under
pretence
of
snuffing
the
candle
moved
it
in
the
required
position
and
speaking
to
the
girl
caused
her
to
raise
her
face
see
her
now
cried
the
spy
should
know
her
among
a
thousand
he
hastily
descended
as
the
opened
and
the
girl
came
out
fagin
drew
him
behind
a
small
partition
which
was
curtained
off
and
they
held
their
breaths
as
she
passed
within
a
few
feet
of
their
place
of
concealment
and
emerged
by
the
door
at
which
they
had
entered
cried
the
lad
who
held
the
door
noah
exchanged
a
look
with
fagin
and
darted
out
the
left
whispered
the
lad
the
left
had
and
keep
od
the
other
side
he
did
so
and
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
saw
the
girl
retreating
figure
already
at
some
distance
before
him
he
advanced
as
near
as
he
considered
prudent
and
kept
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
the
better
to
observe
her
motions
she
looked
nervously
round
twice
or
thrice
and
once
stopped
to
let
two
men
who
were
following
close
behind
her
pass
on
she
seemed
to
gather
courage
as
she
advanced
and
to
walk
with
a
steadier
and
firmer
step
the
spy
preserved
the
same
relative
distance
between
them
and
followed
with
his
eye
upon
her
chapter
xlvi
the
appointment
kept
the
church
clocks
chimed
three
quarters
past
eleven
as
two
figures
emerged
on
london
bridge
one
which
advanced
with
a
swift
and
rapid
step
was
that
of
a
woman
who
looked
eagerly
about
her
as
though
in
quest
of
some
expected
object
the
other
figure
was
that
of
a
man
who
slunk
along
in
the
deepest
shadow
he
could
find
and
at
some
distance
accommodated
his
pace
to
hers
stopping
when
she
stopped
and
as
she
moved
again
creeping
stealthily
on
but
never
allowing
himself
in
the
ardour
of
his
pursuit
to
gain
upon
her
footsteps
thus
they
crossed
the
bridge
from
the
middlesex
to
the
surrey
shore
when
the
woman
apparently
disappointed
in
her
anxious
scrutiny
of
the
turned
back
the
movement
was
sudden
but
he
who
watched
her
was
not
thrown
off
his
guard
by
it
for
shrinking
into
one
of
the
recesses
which
surmount
the
piers
of
the
bridge
and
leaning
over
the
parapet
the
better
to
conceal
his
figure
he
suffered
her
to
pass
on
the
opposite
pavement
when
she
was
about
the
same
distance
in
advance
as
she
had
been
before
he
slipped
quietly
down
and
followed
her
again
at
nearly
the
centre
of
the
bridge
she
stopped
the
man
stopped
too
it
was
a
very
dark
night
the
day
had
been
unfavourable
and
at
that
hour
and
place
there
were
few
people
stirring
such
as
there
were
hurried
quickly
past
very
possibly
without
seeing
but
certainly
without
noticing
either
the
woman
or
the
man
who
kept
her
in
view
their
appearance
was
not
calculated
to
attract
the
importunate
regards
of
such
of
london
destitute
population
as
chanced
to
take
their
way
over
the
bridge
that
night
in
search
of
some
cold
arch
or
doorless
hovel
wherein
to
lay
their
heads
they
stood
there
in
silence
neither
speaking
nor
spoken
to
by
any
one
who
passed
a
mist
hung
over
the
river
deepening
the
red
glare
of
the
fires
that
burnt
upon
the
small
craft
moored
off
the
different
wharfs
and
rendering
darker
and
more
indistinct
the
murky
buildings
on
the
banks
the
old
storehouses
on
either
side
rose
heavy
and
dull
from
the
dense
mass
of
roofs
and
gables
and
frowned
sternly
upon
water
too
black
to
reflect
even
their
lumbering
shapes
the
tower
of
old
saint
saviour
church
and
the
spire
of
saint
magnus
so
long
the
of
the
ancient
bridge
were
visible
in
the
gloom
but
the
forest
of
shipping
below
bridge
and
the
thickly
scattered
spires
of
churches
above
were
nearly
all
hidden
from
sight
the
girl
had
taken
a
few
restless
turns
to
and
fro
closely
watched
meanwhile
by
her
hidden
observer
when
the
heavy
bell
of
tolled
for
the
death
of
another
day
midnight
had
come
upon
the
crowded
city
the
palace
the
the
jail
the
madhouse
the
chambers
of
birth
and
death
of
health
and
sickness
the
rigid
face
of
the
corpse
and
the
calm
sleep
of
the
child
midnight
was
upon
them
all
the
hour
had
not
struck
two
minutes
when
a
young
lady
accompanied
by
a
gentleman
alighted
from
a
within
a
short
distance
of
the
bridge
and
having
dismissed
the
vehicle
walked
straight
towards
it
they
had
scarcely
set
foot
upon
its
pavement
when
the
girl
started
and
immediately
made
towards
them
they
walked
onward
looking
about
them
with
the
air
of
persons
who
entertained
some
very
slight
expectation
which
had
little
chance
of
being
realised
when
they
were
suddenly
joined
by
this
new
associate
they
halted
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
but
suppressed
it
immediately
for
a
man
in
the
garments
of
a
countryman
came
close
up
brushed
against
them
indeed
at
that
precise
moment
here
said
nancy
hurriedly
am
afraid
to
speak
to
you
here
come
away
out
of
the
public
road
down
the
steps
yonder
as
she
uttered
these
words
and
indicated
with
her
hand
the
direction
in
which
she
wished
them
to
proceed
the
countryman
looked
round
and
roughly
asking
what
they
took
up
the
whole
pavement
for
passed
on
the
steps
to
which
the
girl
had
pointed
were
those
which
on
the
surrey
bank
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
bridge
as
saint
church
form
a
from
the
river
to
this
spot
the
man
bearing
the
appearance
of
a
countryman
hastened
unobserved
and
after
a
moment
survey
of
the
place
he
began
to
descend
these
stairs
are
a
part
of
the
bridge
they
consist
of
three
flights
just
below
the
end
of
the
second
going
down
the
stone
wall
on
the
left
terminates
in
an
ornamental
pilaster
facing
towards
the
thames
at
this
point
the
lower
steps
widen
so
that
a
person
turning
that
angle
of
the
wall
is
necessarily
unseen
by
any
others
on
the
stairs
who
chance
to
be
above
him
if
only
a
step
the
countryman
looked
hastily
round
when
he
reached
this
point
and
as
there
seemed
no
better
place
of
concealment
and
the
tide
being
out
there
was
plenty
of
room
he
slipped
aside
with
his
back
to
the
pilaster
and
there
waited
pretty
certain
that
they
would
come
no
lower
and
that
even
if
he
could
not
hear
what
was
said
he
could
follow
them
again
with
safety
so
tardily
stole
the
time
in
this
lonely
place
and
so
eager
was
the
spy
to
penetrate
the
motives
of
an
interview
so
different
from
what
he
had
been
led
to
expect
that
he
more
than
once
gave
the
matter
up
for
lost
and
persuaded
himself
either
that
they
had
stopped
far
above
or
had
resorted
to
some
entirely
different
spot
to
hold
their
mysterious
conversation
he
was
on
the
point
of
emerging
from
his
and
regaining
the
road
above
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
directly
afterwards
of
voices
almost
close
at
his
ear
he
drew
himself
straight
upright
against
the
wall
and
scarcely
breathing
listened
attentively
is
far
enough
said
a
voice
which
was
evidently
that
of
the
gentleman
will
not
suffer
the
young
lady
to
go
any
farther
many
people
would
have
distrusted
you
too
much
to
have
come
even
so
far
but
you
see
i
am
willing
to
humour
you
humour
me
cried
the
voice
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
followed
considerate
indeed
sir
to
humour
me
well
well
it
no
matter
for
what
said
the
gentleman
in
a
kinder
tone
what
purpose
can
you
have
brought
us
to
this
strange
place
why
not
have
let
me
speak
to
you
above
there
where
it
is
light
and
there
is
something
stirring
instead
of
bringing
us
to
this
dark
and
dismal
hole
told
you
before
replied
nancy
i
was
afraid
to
speak
to
you
there
i
do
know
why
it
is
said
the
girl
shuddering
i
have
such
a
fear
and
dread
upon
me
that
i
can
hardly
stand
fear
of
what
asked
the
gentleman
who
seemed
to
pity
her
scarcely
know
of
what
replied
the
girl
wish
i
did
horrible
thoughts
of
death
and
shrouds
with
blood
upon
them
and
a
fear
that
has
made
me
burn
as
if
i
was
on
fire
have
been
upon
me
all
day
i
was
reading
a
book
to
wile
the
time
away
and
the
same
things
came
into
the
print
said
the
gentleman
soothing
her
imagination
replied
the
girl
in
a
hoarse
voice
swear
i
saw
coffin
written
in
every
page
of
the
book
in
large
black
letters
aye
and
they
carried
one
close
to
me
in
the
streets
is
nothing
unusual
in
that
said
the
gentleman
have
passed
me
often
rejoined
the
girl
was
not
there
was
something
so
uncommon
in
her
manner
that
the
flesh
of
the
concealed
listener
crept
as
he
heard
the
girl
utter
these
words
and
the
blood
chilled
within
him
he
had
never
experienced
a
greater
relief
than
in
hearing
the
sweet
voice
of
the
young
lady
as
she
begged
her
to
be
calm
and
not
allow
herself
to
become
the
prey
of
such
fearful
fancies
to
her
kindly
said
the
young
lady
to
her
companion
creature
she
seems
to
need
it
haughty
religious
people
would
have
held
their
heads
up
to
see
me
as
i
am
and
preached
of
flames
and
vengeance
cried
the
girl
dear
lady
why
those
who
claim
to
be
god
own
folks
as
gentle
and
as
kind
to
us
poor
wretches
as
you
who
having
youth
and
beauty
and
all
that
they
have
lost
might
be
a
little
proud
instead
of
so
much
humbler
said
the
gentleman
turk
turns
his
face
after
washing
it
well
to
the
east
when
he
says
his
prayers
these
good
people
after
giving
their
faces
such
a
rub
against
the
world
as
to
take
the
smiles
off
turn
with
no
less
regularity
to
the
darkest
side
of
heaven
between
the
mussulman
and
the
pharisee
commend
me
to
the
first
these
words
appeared
to
be
addressed
to
the
young
lady
and
were
perhaps
uttered
with
the
view
of
affording
nancy
time
to
recover
herself
the
gentleman
shortly
afterwards
addressed
himself
to
her
were
not
here
last
sunday
night
he
said
could
come
replied
nancy
was
kept
by
force
whom
that
i
told
the
young
lady
of
before
were
not
suspected
of
holding
any
communication
with
anybody
on
the
subject
which
has
brought
us
here
i
hope
asked
the
old
gentleman
replied
the
girl
shaking
her
head
not
very
easy
for
me
to
leave
him
unless
he
knows
why
i
could
give
him
a
drink
of
laudanum
before
i
came
away
he
awake
before
you
returned
inquired
the
gentleman
and
neither
he
nor
any
of
them
suspect
me
said
the
gentleman
listen
to
me
am
ready
replied
the
girl
as
he
paused
for
a
moment
young
lady
the
gentleman
began
communicated
to
me
and
to
some
other
friends
who
can
be
safely
trusted
what
you
told
her
nearly
a
fortnight
since
i
confess
to
you
that
i
had
doubts
at
first
whether
you
were
to
be
implicitly
relied
upon
but
now
i
firmly
believe
you
are
am
said
the
girl
earnestly
repeat
that
i
firmly
believe
it
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
disposed
to
trust
you
i
tell
you
without
reserve
that
we
propose
to
extort
the
secret
whatever
it
may
be
from
the
fear
of
this
man
monks
but
if
if
said
the
gentleman
can
not
be
secured
or
if
secured
can
not
be
acted
upon
as
we
wish
you
must
deliver
up
the
jew
cried
the
girl
recoiling
man
must
be
delivered
up
by
you
said
the
gentleman
will
not
do
it
i
will
never
do
it
replied
the
girl
that
he
is
and
worse
than
devil
as
he
has
been
to
me
i
will
never
do
that
will
not
said
the
gentleman
who
seemed
fully
prepared
for
this
answer
returned
the
girl
me
why
one
reason
rejoined
the
girl
firmly
one
reason
that
the
lady
knows
and
will
stand
by
me
in
i
know
she
will
for
i
have
her
promise
and
for
this
other
reason
besides
that
bad
life
as
he
has
led
i
have
led
a
bad
life
too
there
are
many
of
us
who
have
kept
the
same
courses
together
and
i
not
turn
upon
them
who
might
any
of
them
have
turned
upon
me
but
did
bad
as
they
are
said
the
gentleman
quickly
as
if
this
had
been
the
point
he
had
been
aiming
to
attain
monks
into
my
hands
and
leave
him
to
me
to
deal
with
if
he
turns
against
the
others
promise
you
that
in
that
case
if
the
truth
is
forced
from
him
there
the
matter
will
rest
there
must
be
circumstances
in
little
history
which
it
would
be
painful
to
drag
before
the
public
eye
and
if
the
truth
is
once
elicited
they
shall
go
scot
free
if
it
is
not
suggested
the
girl
pursued
the
gentleman
fagin
shall
not
be
brought
to
justice
without
your
consent
in
such
a
case
i
could
show
you
reasons
i
think
which
would
induce
you
to
yield
it
i
the
lady
promise
for
that
asked
the
girl
have
replied
rose
true
and
faithful
pledge
would
never
learn
how
you
knew
what
you
do
said
the
girl
after
a
short
pause
replied
the
gentleman
intelligence
should
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
that
he
could
never
even
guess
have
been
a
liar
and
among
liars
from
a
little
child
said
the
girl
after
another
interval
of
silence
i
will
take
your
words
after
receiving
an
assurance
from
both
that
she
might
safely
do
so
she
proceeded
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
was
often
difficult
for
the
listener
to
discover
even
the
purport
of
what
she
said
to
describe
by
name
and
situation
the
whence
she
had
been
followed
that
night
from
the
manner
in
which
she
occasionally
paused
it
appeared
as
if
the
gentleman
were
making
some
hasty
notes
of
the
information
she
communicated
when
she
had
thoroughly
explained
the
localities
of
the
place
the
best
position
from
which
to
watch
it
without
exciting
observation
and
the
night
and
hour
on
which
monks
was
most
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
it
she
seemed
to
consider
for
a
few
moments
for
the
purpose
of
recalling
his
features
and
appearances
more
forcibly
to
her
recollection
is
tall
said
the
girl
a
strongly
made
man
but
not
stout
he
has
a
lurking
walk
and
as
he
walks
constantly
looks
over
his
shoulder
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
do
forget
that
for
his
eyes
are
sunk
in
his
head
so
much
deeper
than
any
other
man
that
you
might
almost
tell
him
by
that
alone
his
face
is
dark
like
his
hair
and
eyes
and
although
he
ca
be
more
than
six
or
eight
and
twenty
withered
and
haggard
his
lips
are
often
discoloured
and
disfigured
with
the
marks
of
teeth
for
he
has
desperate
fits
and
sometimes
even
bites
his
hands
and
covers
them
with
wounds
why
did
you
start
said
the
girl
stopping
suddenly
the
gentleman
replied
in
a
hurried
manner
that
he
was
not
conscious
of
having
done
so
and
begged
her
to
proceed
of
this
said
the
girl
have
drawn
out
from
other
people
at
the
house
i
tell
you
of
for
i
have
only
seen
him
twice
and
both
times
he
was
covered
up
in
a
large
cloak
i
think
that
all
i
can
give
you
to
know
him
by
stay
though
she
added
his
throat
so
high
that
you
can
see
a
part
of
it
below
his
neckerchief
when
he
turns
his
face
there
is
broad
red
mark
like
a
burn
or
scald
cried
the
gentleman
this
said
the
girl
know
him
the
young
lady
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
for
a
few
moments
they
were
so
still
that
the
listener
could
distinctly
hear
them
breathe
think
i
do
said
the
gentleman
breaking
silence
should
by
your
description
we
shall
see
many
people
are
singularly
like
each
other
it
may
not
be
the
same
as
he
expressed
himself
to
this
effect
with
assumed
carelessness
he
took
a
step
or
two
nearer
the
concealed
spy
as
the
latter
could
tell
from
the
distinctness
with
which
he
heard
him
mutter
must
be
he
he
said
returning
so
it
seemed
by
the
sound
to
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
before
have
given
us
most
valuable
assistance
young
woman
and
i
wish
you
to
be
the
better
for
it
what
can
i
do
to
serve
you
replied
nancy
will
not
persist
in
saying
that
rejoined
the
gentleman
with
a
voice
and
emphasis
of
kindness
that
might
have
touched
a
much
harder
and
more
obdurate
heart
now
tell
me
sir
rejoined
the
girl
weeping
can
do
nothing
to
help
me
i
am
past
all
hope
indeed
put
yourself
beyond
its
pale
said
the
gentleman
past
has
been
a
dreary
waste
with
you
of
youthful
energies
and
such
priceless
treasures
lavished
as
the
creator
bestows
but
once
and
never
grants
again
but
for
the
future
you
may
hope
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
in
our
power
to
offer
you
peace
of
heart
and
mind
for
that
must
come
as
you
seek
it
but
a
quiet
asylum
either
in
england
or
if
you
fear
to
remain
here
in
some
foreign
country
it
is
not
only
within
the
compass
of
our
ability
but
our
most
anxious
wish
to
secure
you
before
the
dawn
of
morning
before
this
river
wakes
to
the
first
glimpse
of
you
shall
be
placed
as
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
your
former
associates
and
leave
as
utter
an
absence
of
all
trace
behind
you
as
if
you
were
to
disappear
from
the
earth
this
moment
come
i
would
not
have
you
go
back
to
exchange
one
word
with
any
old
companion
or
take
one
look
at
any
old
haunt
or
breathe
the
very
air
which
is
pestilence
and
death
to
you
quit
them
all
while
there
is
time
and
opportunity
will
be
persuaded
now
cried
the
young
lady
hesitates
i
am
sure
fear
not
my
dear
said
the
gentleman
sir
i
do
not
replied
the
girl
after
a
short
struggle
am
chained
to
my
old
life
i
loathe
and
hate
it
now
but
i
can
not
leave
it
i
must
have
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
and
yet
i
do
know
for
if
you
had
spoken
to
me
so
some
time
ago
i
should
have
laughed
it
off
but
she
said
looking
hastily
round
fear
comes
over
me
again
i
must
go
home
repeated
the
young
lady
with
great
stress
upon
the
word
lady
rejoined
the
girl
such
a
home
as
i
have
raised
for
myself
with
the
work
of
my
whole
life
let
us
part
i
shall
be
watched
or
seen
go
go
if
i
have
done
you
any
service
all
i
ask
is
that
you
leave
me
and
let
me
go
my
way
alone
is
useless
said
the
gentleman
with
a
sigh
compromise
her
safety
perhaps
by
staying
here
we
may
have
detained
her
longer
than
she
expected
already
yes
urged
the
girl
have
cried
the
young
lady
be
the
end
of
this
poor
life
repeated
the
girl
before
you
lady
look
at
that
dark
water
how
many
times
do
you
read
of
such
as
i
who
spring
into
the
tide
and
leave
no
living
thing
to
care
for
or
bewail
them
it
may
be
years
hence
or
it
may
be
only
months
but
i
shall
come
to
that
at
last
not
speak
thus
pray
returned
the
young
lady
sobbing
will
never
reach
your
ears
dear
lady
and
god
forbid
such
horrors
should
replied
the
girl
the
gentleman
turned
away
purse
cried
the
young
lady
it
for
my
sake
that
you
may
have
some
resource
in
an
hour
of
need
and
trouble
replied
the
girl
have
not
done
this
for
money
let
me
have
that
to
think
of
and
yet
give
me
something
that
you
have
worn
i
should
like
to
have
something
no
no
not
a
ring
your
gloves
or
handkerchief
anything
that
i
can
keep
as
having
belonged
to
you
sweet
lady
there
bless
you
god
bless
you
the
violent
agitation
of
the
girl
and
the
apprehension
of
some
discovery
which
would
subject
her
to
and
violence
seemed
to
determine
the
gentleman
to
leave
her
as
she
requested
the
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
were
audible
and
the
voices
ceased
the
two
figures
of
the
young
lady
and
her
companion
soon
afterwards
appeared
upon
the
bridge
they
stopped
at
the
summit
of
the
stairs
cried
the
young
lady
listening
she
call
i
thought
i
heard
her
voice
my
love
replied
brownlow
looking
sadly
back
has
not
moved
and
will
not
till
we
are
gone
rose
maylie
lingered
but
the
old
gentleman
drew
her
arm
through
his
and
led
her
with
gentle
force
away
as
they
disappeared
the
girl
sunk
down
nearly
at
her
full
length
upon
one
of
the
stone
stairs
and
vented
the
anguish
of
her
heart
in
bitter
tears
after
a
time
she
arose
and
with
feeble
and
tottering
steps
ascended
the
street
the
astonished
listener
remained
motionless
on
his
post
for
some
minutes
afterwards
and
having
ascertained
with
many
cautious
glances
round
him
that
he
was
again
alone
crept
slowly
from
his
and
returned
stealthily
and
in
the
shade
of
the
wall
in
the
same
manner
as
he
had
descended
peeping
out
more
than
once
when
he
reached
the
top
to
make
sure
that
he
was
unobserved
noah
claypole
darted
away
at
his
utmost
speed
and
made
for
the
jew
house
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
chapter
xlvii
fatal
consequences
it
was
nearly
two
hours
before
that
time
which
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
may
be
truly
called
the
dead
of
night
when
the
streets
are
silent
and
deserted
when
even
sounds
appear
to
slumber
and
profligacy
and
riot
have
staggered
home
to
dream
it
was
at
this
still
and
silent
hour
that
fagin
sat
watching
in
his
old
lair
with
face
so
distorted
and
pale
and
eyes
so
red
and
that
he
looked
less
like
a
man
than
like
some
hideous
phantom
moist
from
the
grave
and
worried
by
an
evil
spirit
he
sat
crouching
over
a
cold
hearth
wrapped
in
an
old
torn
coverlet
with
his
face
turned
towards
a
wasting
candle
that
stood
upon
a
table
by
his
side
his
right
hand
was
raised
to
his
lips
and
as
absorbed
in
thought
he
hit
his
long
black
nails
he
disclosed
among
his
toothless
gums
a
few
such
fangs
as
should
have
been
a
dog
or
rat
stretched
upon
a
mattress
on
the
floor
lay
noah
claypole
fast
asleep
towards
him
the
old
man
sometimes
directed
his
eyes
for
an
instant
and
then
brought
them
back
again
to
the
candle
which
with
a
wick
drooping
almost
double
and
hot
grease
falling
down
in
clots
upon
the
table
plainly
showed
that
his
thoughts
were
busy
elsewhere
indeed
they
were
mortification
at
the
overthrow
of
his
notable
scheme
hatred
of
the
girl
who
had
dared
to
palter
with
strangers
and
utter
distrust
of
the
sincerity
of
her
refusal
to
yield
him
up
bitter
disappointment
at
the
loss
of
his
revenge
on
sikes
the
fear
of
detection
and
ruin
and
death
and
a
fierce
and
deadly
rage
kindled
by
all
these
were
the
passionate
considerations
which
following
close
upon
each
other
with
rapid
and
ceaseless
whirl
shot
through
the
brain
of
fagin
as
every
evil
thought
and
blackest
purpose
lay
working
at
his
heart
he
sat
without
changing
his
attitude
in
the
least
or
appearing
to
take
the
smallest
heed
of
time
until
his
quick
ear
seemed
to
be
attracted
by
a
footstep
in
the
street
last
he
muttered
wiping
his
dry
and
fevered
mouth
last
the
bell
rang
gently
as
he
spoke
he
crept
upstairs
to
the
door
and
presently
returned
accompanied
by
a
man
muffled
to
the
chin
who
carried
a
bundle
under
one
arm
sitting
down
and
throwing
back
his
outer
coat
the
man
displayed
the
burly
frame
of
sikes
he
said
laying
the
bundle
on
the
table
care
of
that
and
do
the
most
you
can
with
it
it
been
trouble
enough
to
get
i
thought
i
should
have
been
here
three
hours
ago
fagin
laid
his
hand
upon
the
bundle
and
locking
it
in
the
cupboard
sat
down
again
without
speaking
but
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
robber
for
an
instant
during
this
action
and
now
that
they
sat
over
against
each
other
face
to
face
he
looked
fixedly
at
him
with
his
lips
quivering
so
violently
and
his
face
so
altered
by
the
emotions
which
had
mastered
him
that
the
housebreaker
involuntarily
drew
back
his
chair
and
surveyed
him
with
a
look
of
real
affright
now
cried
sikes
do
you
look
at
a
man
so
for
fagin
raised
his
right
hand
and
shook
his
trembling
forefinger
in
the
air
but
his
passion
was
so
great
that
the
power
of
speech
was
for
the
moment
gone
said
sikes
feeling
in
his
breast
with
a
look
of
alarm
gone
mad
i
must
look
to
myself
here
no
rejoined
fagin
finding
his
voice
not
you
not
the
person
bill
i
no
no
fault
to
find
with
you
you
have
have
you
said
sikes
looking
sternly
at
him
and
ostentatiously
passing
a
pistol
into
a
more
convenient
pocket
lucky
for
one
of
us
which
one
that
is
do
matter
got
that
to
tell
you
bill
said
fagin
drawing
his
chair
nearer
make
you
worse
than
me
returned
the
robber
with
an
incredulous
air
away
look
sharp
or
nance
will
think
i
lost
cried
fagin
has
pretty
well
settled
that
in
her
own
mind
already
sikes
looked
with
an
aspect
of
great
perplexity
into
the
jew
face
and
reading
no
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
riddle
there
clenched
his
coat
collar
in
his
huge
hand
and
shook
him
soundly
will
you
he
said
if
you
do
it
shall
be
for
want
of
breath
open
your
mouth
and
say
wot
you
got
to
say
in
plain
words
out
with
it
you
thundering
old
cur
out
with
it
that
lad
that
laying
there
fagin
began
sikes
turned
round
to
where
noah
was
sleeping
as
if
he
had
not
previously
observed
him
he
said
resuming
his
former
position
that
lad
pursued
fagin
to
peach
to
blow
upon
us
all
first
seeking
out
the
right
folks
for
the
purpose
and
then
having
a
meeting
with
in
the
street
to
paint
our
likenesses
describe
every
mark
that
they
might
know
us
by
and
the
crib
where
we
might
be
most
easily
taken
suppose
he
was
to
do
all
this
and
besides
to
blow
upon
a
plant
we
all
been
in
more
or
less
of
his
own
fancy
not
grabbed
trapped
tried
earwigged
by
the
parson
and
brought
to
it
on
bread
and
water
but
of
his
own
fancy
to
please
his
own
taste
stealing
out
at
nights
to
find
those
most
interested
against
us
and
peaching
to
them
do
you
hear
me
cried
the
jew
his
eyes
flashing
with
rage
he
did
all
this
what
then
then
replied
sikes
with
a
tremendous
oath
he
was
left
alive
till
i
came
i
grind
his
skull
under
the
iron
heel
of
my
boot
into
as
many
grains
as
there
are
hairs
upon
his
head
if
i
did
it
cried
fagin
almost
in
a
yell
that
knows
so
much
and
could
hang
so
many
besides
myself
do
know
replied
sikes
clenching
his
teeth
and
turning
white
at
the
mere
suggestion
do
something
in
the
jail
that
get
me
put
in
irons
and
if
i
was
tried
along
with
you
i
fall
upon
you
with
them
in
the
open
court
and
beat
your
brains
out
afore
the
people
i
should
have
such
strength
muttered
the
robber
poising
his
brawny
arm
i
could
smash
your
head
as
if
a
loaded
waggon
had
gone
over
it
would
i
said
the
housebreaker
me
it
was
charley
or
the
dodger
or
bet
or
do
care
who
replied
sikes
impatiently
it
was
serve
them
the
same
fagin
looked
hard
at
the
robber
and
motioning
him
to
be
silent
stooped
over
the
bed
upon
the
floor
and
shook
the
sleeper
to
rouse
him
sikes
leant
forward
in
his
chair
looking
on
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
as
if
wondering
much
what
all
this
questioning
and
preparation
was
to
end
in
bolter
poor
lad
said
fagin
looking
up
with
an
expression
of
devilish
anticipation
and
speaking
slowly
and
with
marked
emphasis
tired
tired
with
watching
for
her
so
long
watching
for
bill
d
mean
asked
sikes
drawing
back
fagin
made
no
answer
but
bending
over
the
sleeper
again
hauled
him
into
a
sitting
posture
when
his
assumed
name
had
been
repeated
several
times
noah
rubbed
his
eyes
and
giving
a
heavy
yawn
looked
sleepily
about
him
me
that
again
once
again
just
for
him
to
hear
said
the
jew
pointing
to
sikes
as
he
spoke
yer
what
asked
the
sleepy
noah
shaking
himself
pettishly
about
said
fagin
clutching
sikes
by
the
wrist
as
if
to
prevent
his
leaving
the
house
before
he
had
heard
enough
followed
her
london
bridge
she
met
two
people
she
did
gentleman
and
a
lady
that
she
had
gone
to
of
her
own
accord
before
who
asked
her
to
give
up
all
her
pals
and
monks
first
which
she
did
and
to
describe
him
which
she
did
and
to
tell
her
what
house
it
was
that
we
meet
at
and
go
to
which
she
did
and
where
it
could
be
best
watched
from
which
she
did
and
what
time
the
people
went
there
which
she
did
she
did
all
this
she
told
it
all
every
word
without
a
threat
without
a
murmur
she
did
did
she
not
cried
fagin
half
mad
with
fury
right
replied
noah
scratching
his
head
just
what
it
was
did
they
say
about
last
sunday
last
sunday
replied
noah
considering
i
told
yer
that
before
tell
it
again
cried
fagin
tightening
his
grasp
on
sikes
and
brandishing
his
other
hand
aloft
as
the
foam
flew
from
his
lips
asked
her
said
noah
who
as
he
grew
more
wakeful
seemed
to
have
a
dawning
perception
who
sikes
was
asked
her
why
she
come
last
sunday
as
she
promised
she
said
she
could
why
tell
him
that
she
was
forcibly
kept
at
home
by
bill
the
man
she
had
told
them
of
before
replied
noah
more
of
him
cried
fagin
more
of
the
man
she
had
told
them
of
before
tell
him
that
tell
him
that
that
she
could
very
easily
get
out
of
doors
unless
he
knew
where
she
was
going
to
said
noah
so
the
first
time
she
went
to
see
the
lady
she
ha
ha
ha
it
made
me
laugh
when
she
said
it
that
it
did
she
gave
him
a
drink
of
laudanum
fire
cried
sikes
breaking
fiercely
from
the
jew
me
go
flinging
the
old
man
from
him
he
rushed
from
the
room
and
darted
wildly
and
furiously
up
the
stairs
bill
cried
fagin
following
him
hastily
word
only
a
word
the
word
would
not
have
been
exchanged
but
that
the
housebreaker
was
unable
to
open
the
door
on
which
he
was
expending
fruitless
oaths
and
violence
when
the
jew
came
panting
up
me
out
said
sikes
speak
to
me
it
not
safe
let
me
out
i
say
me
speak
a
word
rejoined
fagin
laying
his
hand
upon
the
lock
wo
be
replied
the
other
wo
be
too
violent
bill
the
day
was
breaking
and
there
was
light
enough
for
the
men
to
see
each
other
faces
they
exchanged
one
brief
glance
there
was
a
fire
in
the
eyes
of
both
which
could
not
be
mistaken
mean
said
fagin
showing
that
he
felt
all
disguise
was
now
useless
too
violent
for
safety
be
crafty
bill
and
not
too
bold
sikes
made
no
reply
but
pulling
open
the
door
of
which
fagin
had
turned
the
lock
dashed
into
the
silent
streets
without
one
pause
or
moment
consideration
without
once
turning
his
head
to
the
right
or
left
or
raising
his
eyes
to
the
sky
or
lowering
them
to
the
ground
but
looking
straight
before
him
with
savage
resolution
his
teeth
so
tightly
compressed
that
the
strained
jaw
seemed
starting
through
his
skin
the
robber
held
on
his
headlong
course
nor
muttered
a
word
nor
relaxed
a
muscle
until
he
reached
his
own
door
he
opened
it
softly
with
a
key
strode
lightly
up
the
stairs
and
entering
his
own
room
the
door
and
lifting
a
heavy
table
against
it
drew
back
the
curtain
of
the
bed
the
girl
was
lying
upon
it
he
had
roused
her
from
her
sleep
for
she
raised
herself
with
a
hurried
and
startled
look
up
said
the
man
is
you
bill
said
the
girl
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
at
his
return
is
was
the
reply
up
there
was
a
candle
burning
but
the
man
hastily
drew
it
from
the
candlestick
and
hurled
it
under
the
grate
seeing
the
faint
light
of
early
day
without
the
girl
rose
to
undraw
the
curtain
it
be
said
sikes
thrusting
his
hand
before
her
enough
light
for
wot
i
got
to
do
said
the
girl
in
the
low
voice
of
alarm
do
you
look
like
that
at
me
the
robber
sat
regarding
her
for
a
few
seconds
with
dilated
nostrils
and
heaving
breast
and
then
grasping
her
by
the
head
and
throat
dragged
her
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looking
once
towards
the
door
placed
his
heavy
hand
upon
her
mouth
bill
gasped
the
girl
wrestling
with
the
strength
of
mortal
fear
i
wo
scream
or
cry
not
once
hear
me
speak
to
me
tell
me
what
i
have
done

she
devil
returned
the
robber
suppressing
his
breath
were
watched
every
word
you
said
was
heard
spare
my
life
for
the
love
of
heaven
as
i
spared
yours
rejoined
the
girl
clinging
to
him
dear
bill
you
can
not
have
the
heart
to
kill
me
oh
think
of
all
i
have
given
up
only
this
one
night
for
you
you
have
time
to
think
and
save
yourself
this
crime
i
will
not
loose
my
hold
you
can
not
throw
me
off
bill
bill
for
dear
god
sake
for
your
own
for
mine
stop
before
you
spill
my
blood
i
have
been
true
to
you
upon
my
guilty
soul
i
have
the
man
struggled
violently
to
release
his
arms
but
those
of
the
girl
were
clasped
round
his
and
tear
her
as
he
would
he
could
not
tear
them
away
cried
the
girl
striving
to
lay
her
head
upon
his
breast
gentleman
and
that
dear
lady
told
me
of
a
home
in
some
foreign
country
where
i
could
end
my
days
in
solitude
and
peace
let
me
see
them
again
and
beg
them
on
my
knees
to
show
the
same
mercy
and
goodness
to
you
and
let
us
both
leave
this
dreadful
place
and
far
apart
lead
better
lives
and
forget
how
we
have
lived
except
in
prayers
and
never
see
each
other
more
it
is
never
too
late
to
repent
they
told
me
so
i
feel
it
now
but
we
must
have
time
a
little
little
time
the
housebreaker
freed
one
arm
and
grasped
his
pistol
the
certainty
of
immediate
detection
if
he
fired
flashed
across
his
mind
even
in
the
midst
of
his
fury
and
he
beat
it
twice
with
all
the
force
he
could
summon
upon
the
upturned
face
that
almost
touched
his
own
she
staggered
and
fell
nearly
blinded
with
the
blood
that
rained
down
from
a
deep
gash
in
her
forehead
but
raising
herself
with
difficulty
on
her
knees
drew
from
her
bosom
a
white
handkerchief
rose
own
and
holding
it
up
in
her
folded
hands
as
high
towards
heaven
as
her
feeble
strength
would
allow
breathed
one
prayer
for
mercy
to
her
maker
it
was
a
ghastly
figure
to
look
upon
the
murderer
staggering
backward
to
the
wall
and
shutting
out
the
sight
with
his
hand
seized
a
heavy
club
and
struck
her
down
chapter
xlviii
the
flight
of
sikes
of
all
bad
deeds
that
under
cover
of
the
darkness
had
been
committed
within
wide
london
bounds
since
night
hung
over
it
that
was
the
worst
of
all
the
horrors
that
rose
with
an
ill
scent
upon
the
morning
air
that
was
the
foulest
and
most
cruel
the
sun
the
bright
sun
that
brings
back
not
light
alone
but
new
life
and
hope
and
freshness
to
man
burst
upon
the
crowded
city
in
clear
and
radiant
glory
through
glass
and
window
through
cathedral
dome
and
rotten
crevice
it
shed
its
equal
ray
it
lighted
up
the
room
where
the
murdered
woman
lay
it
did
he
tried
to
shut
it
out
but
it
would
stream
in
if
the
sight
had
been
a
ghastly
one
in
the
dull
morning
what
was
it
now
in
all
that
brilliant
light
he
had
not
moved
he
had
been
afraid
to
stir
there
had
been
a
moan
and
motion
of
the
hand
and
with
terror
added
to
rage
he
had
struck
and
struck
again
once
he
threw
a
rug
over
it
but
it
was
worse
to
fancy
the
eyes
and
imagine
them
moving
towards
him
than
to
see
them
glaring
upward
as
if
watching
the
reflection
of
the
pool
of
gore
that
quivered
and
danced
in
the
sunlight
on
the
ceiling
he
had
plucked
it
off
again
and
there
was
the
body
mere
flesh
and
blood
no
more
but
such
flesh
and
so
much
blood
he
struck
a
light
kindled
a
fire
and
thrust
the
club
into
it
there
was
hair
upon
the
end
which
blazed
and
shrunk
into
a
light
cinder
and
caught
by
the
air
whirled
up
the
chimney
even
that
frightened
him
sturdy
as
he
was
but
he
held
the
weapon
till
it
broke
and
then
piled
it
on
the
coals
to
burn
away
and
smoulder
into
ashes
he
washed
himself
and
rubbed
his
clothes
there
were
spots
that
would
not
be
removed
but
he
cut
the
pieces
out
and
burnt
them
how
those
stains
were
dispersed
about
the
room
the
very
feet
of
the
dog
were
bloody
all
this
time
he
had
never
once
turned
his
back
upon
the
corpse
no
not
for
a
moment
such
preparations
completed
he
moved
backward
towards
the
door
dragging
the
dog
with
him
lest
he
should
soil
his
feet
anew
and
carry
out
new
evidence
of
the
crime
into
the
streets
he
shut
the
door
softly
locked
it
took
the
key
and
left
the
house
he
crossed
over
and
glanced
up
at
the
window
to
be
sure
that
nothing
was
visible
from
the
outside
there
was
the
curtain
still
drawn
which
she
would
have
opened
to
admit
the
light
she
never
saw
again
it
lay
nearly
under
there
knew
that
god
how
the
sun
poured
down
upon
the
very
spot
the
glance
was
instantaneous
it
was
a
relief
to
have
got
free
of
the
room
he
whistled
on
the
dog
and
walked
rapidly
away
he
went
through
islington
strode
up
the
hill
at
highgate
on
which
stands
the
stone
in
honour
of
whittington
turned
down
to
highgate
hill
unsteady
of
purpose
and
uncertain
where
to
go
struck
off
to
the
right
again
almost
as
soon
as
he
began
to
descend
it
and
taking
the
across
the
fields
skirted
caen
wood
and
so
came
on
hampstead
heath
traversing
the
hollow
by
the
vale
of
heath
he
mounted
the
opposite
bank
and
crossing
the
road
which
joins
the
villages
of
hampstead
and
highgate
made
along
the
remaining
portion
of
the
heath
to
the
fields
at
north
end
in
one
of
which
he
laid
himself
down
under
a
hedge
and
slept
soon
he
was
up
again
and
away
not
far
into
the
country
but
back
towards
london
by
the
then
back
again
then
over
another
part
of
the
same
ground
as
he
already
traversed
then
wandering
up
and
down
in
fields
and
lying
on
ditches
brinks
to
rest
and
starting
up
to
make
for
some
other
spot
and
do
the
same
and
ramble
on
again
where
could
he
go
that
was
near
and
not
too
public
to
get
some
meat
and
drink
hendon
that
was
a
good
place
not
far
off
and
out
of
most
people
way
thither
he
directed
his
steps
running
sometimes
and
sometimes
with
a
strange
perversity
loitering
at
a
snail
pace
or
stopping
altogether
and
idly
breaking
the
hedges
with
a
stick
but
when
he
got
there
all
the
people
he
met
the
very
children
at
the
doors
seemed
to
view
him
with
suspicion
back
he
turned
again
without
the
courage
to
purchase
bit
or
drop
though
he
had
tasted
no
food
for
many
hours
and
once
more
he
lingered
on
the
heath
uncertain
where
to
go
he
wandered
over
miles
and
miles
of
ground
and
still
came
back
to
the
old
place
morning
and
noon
had
passed
and
the
day
was
on
the
wane
and
still
he
rambled
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
and
round
and
round
and
still
lingered
about
the
same
spot
at
last
he
got
away
and
shaped
his
course
for
hatfield
it
was
nine
at
night
when
the
man
quite
tired
out
and
the
dog
limping
and
lame
from
the
unaccustomed
exercise
turned
down
the
hill
by
the
church
of
the
quiet
village
and
plodding
along
the
little
street
crept
into
a
small
whose
scanty
light
had
guided
them
to
the
spot
there
was
a
fire
in
the
and
some
were
drinking
before
it
they
made
room
for
the
stranger
but
he
sat
down
in
the
furthest
corner
and
ate
and
drank
alone
or
rather
with
his
dog
to
whom
he
cast
a
morsel
of
food
from
time
to
time
the
conversation
of
the
men
assembled
here
turned
upon
the
neighbouring
land
and
farmers
and
when
those
topics
were
exhausted
upon
the
age
of
some
old
man
who
had
been
buried
on
the
previous
sunday
the
young
men
present
considering
him
very
old
and
the
old
men
present
declaring
him
to
have
been
quite
young
not
older
one
grandfather
said
than
he
was
with
ten
or
fifteen
year
of
life
in
him
at
least
if
he
had
taken
care
if
he
had
taken
care
there
was
nothing
to
attract
attention
or
excite
alarm
in
this
the
robber
after
paying
his
reckoning
sat
silent
and
unnoticed
in
his
corner
and
had
almost
dropped
asleep
when
he
was
half
wakened
by
the
noisy
entrance
of
a
new
comer
this
was
an
antic
fellow
half
pedlar
and
half
mountebank
who
travelled
about
the
country
on
foot
to
vend
hones
strops
razors
washballs
medicine
for
dogs
and
horses
cheap
perfumery
cosmetics
and
wares
which
he
carried
in
a
case
slung
to
his
back
his
entrance
was
the
signal
for
various
homely
jokes
with
the
countrymen
which
slackened
not
until
he
had
made
his
supper
and
opened
his
box
of
treasures
when
he
ingeniously
contrived
to
unite
business
with
amusement
what
be
that
stoof
good
to
eat
harry
asked
a
grinning
countryman
pointing
to
some
in
one
corner
said
the
fellow
producing
one
is
the
infallible
and
invaluable
composition
for

all
sorts
of

with
the
infallible

invaluable
composition
if
a
lady
stains
her
honour
she
has
only
need
to
swallow
one
cake
and
she
cured
at
once
for
it
poison
if
a
gentleman
wants
to
prove
this
he
has
only
need
to
bolt
one
little
square
and
he
has
put
it
beyond
question
for
it
quite
as
satisfactory
as
a
and
a
great
deal
nastier
in
the
flavour
consequently
the
more
credit
in
taking
it
one
penny
a
square
with
all
these
virtues
one
penny
a
square
there
were
two
buyers
directly
and
more
of
the
listeners
plainly
hesitated
the
vendor
observing
this
increased
in
loquacity
all
bought
up
as
fast
as
it
can
be
made
said
the
fellow
are
fourteen
six
and
a
galvanic
battery
always
upon
it
and
they
ca
make
it
fast
enough
though
the
men
work
so
hard
that
they
die
off
and
the
widows
is
pensioned
directly
with
twenty
pound
for
each
of
the
children
and
a
premium
of
fifty
for
twins
one
penny
a
square
two
is
all
the
same
and
four
farthings
is
received
with
joy
one
penny
a
square
here
is
a
stain
upon
the
hat
of
a
gentleman
in
company
that
i
take
clean
out
before
he
can
order
me
a
pint
of
ale
cried
sikes
starting
up
that
back

it
clean
out
sir
replied
the
man
winking
to
the
company
you
can
come
across
the
room
to
get
it
gentlemen
all
observe
the
dark
stain
upon
this
gentleman
hat
no
wider
than
a
shilling
but
thicker
than
a
whether
it
is
a
or
the
man
got
no
further
for
sikes
with
a
hideous
imprecation
overthrew
the
table
and
tearing
the
hat
from
him
burst
out
of
the
house
with
the
same
perversity
of
feeling
and
irresolution
that
had
fastened
upon
him
despite
himself
all
day
the
murderer
finding
that
he
was
not
followed
and
that
they
most
probably
considered
him
some
drunken
sullen
fellow
turned
back
up
the
town
and
getting
out
of
the
glare
of
the
lamps
of
a
that
was
standing
in
the
street
was
walking
past
when
he
recognised
the
mail
from
london
and
saw
that
it
was
standing
at
the
little
he
almost
knew
what
was
to
come
but
he
crossed
over
and
listened
the
guard
was
standing
at
the
door
waiting
for
the
a
man
dressed
like
a
came
up
at
the
moment
and
he
handed
him
a
basket
which
lay
ready
on
the
pavement
for
your
people
said
the
guard
look
alive
in
there
will
you
damn
that
bag
it
war
ready
night
afore
last
this
wo
do
you
know
new
up
in
town
ben
asked
the
drawing
back
to
the
the
better
to
admire
the
horses
nothing
that
i
knows
on
replied
the
man
pulling
on
his
gloves
up
a
little
i
heerd
talk
of
a
murder
too
down
spitalfields
way
but
i
do
reckon
much
upon
it
that
quite
true
said
a
gentleman
inside
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
a
dreadful
murder
it
was
it
sir
rejoined
the
guard
touching
his
hat
or
woman
pray
sir
woman
replied
the
gentleman
is
supposed
ben
replied
the
coachman
impatiently
that
bag
said
the
guard
you
gone
to
sleep
in
there
cried
the
office
keeper
running
out
growled
the
guard
and
so
the
young
of
property
that
going
to
take
a
fancy
to
me
but
i
do
know
when
here
give
hold
all
ri
ight
the
horn
sounded
a
few
cheerful
notes
and
the
coach
was
gone
sikes
remained
standing
in
the
street
apparently
unmoved
by
what
he
had
just
heard
and
agitated
by
no
stronger
feeling
than
a
doubt
where
to
go
at
length
he
went
back
again
and
took
the
road
which
leads
from
hatfield
to
albans
he
went
on
doggedly
but
as
he
left
the
town
behind
him
and
plunged
into
the
solitude
and
darkness
of
the
road
he
felt
a
dread
and
awe
creeping
upon
him
which
shook
him
to
the
core
every
object
before
him
substance
or
shadow
still
or
moving
took
the
semblance
of
some
fearful
thing
but
these
fears
were
nothing
compared
to
the
sense
that
haunted
him
of
that
morning
ghastly
figure
following
at
his
heels
he
could
trace
its
shadow
in
the
gloom
supply
the
smallest
item
of
the
outline
and
note
how
stiff
and
solemn
it
seemed
to
stalk
along
he
could
hear
its
garments
rustling
in
the
leaves
and
every
breath
of
wind
came
laden
with
that
last
low
cry
if
he
stopped
it
did
the
same
if
he
ran
it
followed
not
running
too
that
would
have
been
a
relief
but
like
a
corpse
endowed
with
the
mere
machinery
of
life
and
borne
on
one
slow
melancholy
wind
that
never
rose
or
fell
at
times
he
turned
with
desperate
determination
resolved
to
beat
this
phantom
off
though
it
should
look
him
dead
but
the
hair
rose
on
his
head
and
his
blood
stood
still
for
it
had
turned
with
him
and
was
behind
him
then
he
had
kept
it
before
him
that
morning
but
it
was
behind
now
always
he
leaned
his
back
against
a
bank
and
felt
that
it
stood
above
him
visibly
out
against
the
cold
he
threw
himself
upon
the
road
on
his
back
upon
the
road
at
his
head
it
stood
silent
erect
and
still
a
living
with
its
epitaph
in
blood
let
no
man
talk
of
murderers
escaping
justice
and
hint
that
providence
must
sleep
there
were
twenty
score
of
violent
deaths
in
one
long
minute
of
that
agony
of
fear
there
was
a
shed
in
a
field
he
passed
that
offered
shelter
for
the
night
before
the
door
were
three
tall
poplar
trees
which
made
it
very
dark
within
and
the
wind
moaned
through
them
with
a
dismal
wail
he
walk
on
till
daylight
came
again
and
here
he
stretched
himself
close
to
the
wall
to
undergo
new
torture
for
now
a
vision
came
before
him
as
constant
and
more
terrible
than
that
from
which
he
had
escaped
those
widely
staring
eyes
so
lustreless
and
so
glassy
that
he
had
better
borne
to
see
them
than
think
upon
them
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
light
in
themselves
but
giving
light
to
nothing
there
were
but
two
but
they
were
everywhere
if
he
shut
out
the
sight
there
came
the
room
with
every
object
some
indeed
that
he
would
have
forgotten
if
he
had
gone
over
its
contents
from
memory
each
in
its
accustomed
place
the
body
was
in
place
and
its
eyes
were
as
he
saw
them
when
he
stole
away
he
got
up
and
rushed
into
the
field
without
the
figure
was
behind
him
he
the
shed
and
shrunk
down
once
more
the
eyes
were
there
before
he
had
laid
himself
along
and
here
he
remained
in
such
terror
as
none
but
he
can
know
trembling
in
every
limb
and
the
cold
sweat
starting
from
every
pore
when
suddenly
there
arose
upon
the
the
noise
of
distant
shouting
and
the
roar
of
voices
mingled
in
alarm
and
wonder
any
sound
of
men
in
that
lonely
place
even
though
it
conveyed
a
real
cause
of
alarm
was
something
to
him
he
regained
his
strength
and
energy
at
the
prospect
of
personal
danger
and
springing
to
his
feet
rushed
into
the
open
air
the
broad
sky
seemed
on
fire
rising
into
the
air
with
showers
of
sparks
and
rolling
one
above
the
other
were
sheets
of
flame
lighting
the
atmosphere
for
miles
round
and
driving
clouds
of
smoke
in
the
direction
where
he
stood
the
shouts
grew
louder
as
new
voices
swelled
the
roar
and
he
could
hear
the
cry
of
fire
mingled
with
the
ringing
of
an
the
fall
of
heavy
bodies
and
the
crackling
of
flames
as
they
twined
round
some
new
obstacle
and
shot
aloft
as
though
refreshed
by
food
the
noise
increased
as
he
looked
there
were
people
there
men
and
women
light
bustle
it
was
like
new
life
to
him
he
darted
onward
straight
headlong
dashing
through
brier
and
brake
and
leaping
gate
and
fence
as
madly
as
his
dog
who
careered
with
loud
and
sounding
bark
before
him
he
came
upon
the
spot
there
were
figures
tearing
to
and
fro
some
endeavouring
to
drag
the
frightened
horses
from
the
stables
others
driving
the
cattle
from
the
yard
and
and
others
coming
laden
from
the
burning
pile
amidst
a
shower
of
falling
sparks
and
the
tumbling
down
of
beams
the
apertures
where
doors
and
windows
stood
an
hour
ago
disclosed
a
mass
of
raging
fire
walls
rocked
and
crumbled
into
the
burning
well
the
molten
lead
and
iron
poured
down
white
hot
upon
the
ground
women
and
children
shrieked
and
men
encouraged
each
other
with
noisy
shouts
and
cheers
the
clanking
of
the
and
the
spirting
and
hissing
of
the
water
as
it
fell
upon
the
blazing
wood
added
to
the
tremendous
roar
he
shouted
too
till
he
was
hoarse
and
flying
from
memory
and
himself
plunged
into
the
thickest
of
the
throng
hither
and
thither
he
dived
that
night
now
working
at
the
pumps
and
now
hurrying
through
the
smoke
and
flame
but
never
ceasing
to
engage
himself
wherever
noise
and
men
were
thickest
up
and
down
the
ladders
upon
the
roofs
of
buildings
over
floors
that
quaked
and
trembled
with
his
weight
under
the
lee
of
falling
bricks
and
stones
in
every
part
of
that
great
fire
was
he
but
he
bore
a
charmed
life
and
had
neither
scratch
nor
bruise
nor
weariness
nor
thought
till
morning
dawned
again
and
only
smoke
and
blackened
ruins
remained
this
mad
excitement
over
there
returned
with
force
the
dreadful
consciousness
of
his
crime
he
looked
suspiciously
about
him
for
the
men
were
conversing
in
groups
and
he
feared
to
be
the
subject
of
their
talk
the
dog
obeyed
the
significant
beck
of
his
finger
and
they
drew
off
stealthily
together
he
passed
near
an
engine
where
some
men
were
seated
and
they
called
to
him
to
share
in
their
refreshment
he
took
some
bread
and
meat
and
as
he
drank
a
draught
of
beer
heard
the
firemen
who
were
from
london
talking
about
the
murder
has
gone
to
birmingham
they
say
said
one
have
him
yet
for
the
scouts
are
out
and
by
night
be
a
cry
all
through
the
country
he
hurried
off
and
walked
till
he
almost
dropped
upon
the
ground
then
lay
down
in
a
lane
and
had
a
long
but
broken
and
uneasy
sleep
he
wandered
on
again
irresolute
and
undecided
and
oppressed
with
the
fear
of
another
solitary
night
suddenly
he
took
the
desperate
resolution
to
going
back
to
london
somebody
to
speak
to
there
at
all
event
he
thought
good
too
they
never
expect
to
nab
me
there
after
this
country
scent
why
ca
i
lie
by
for
a
week
or
so
and
forcing
blunt
from
fagin
get
abroad
to
france
damme
i
risk
it
he
acted
upon
this
impulse
without
delay
and
choosing
the
least
frequented
roads
began
his
journey
back
resolved
to
lie
concealed
within
a
short
distance
of
the
metropolis
and
entering
it
at
dusk
by
a
circuitous
route
to
proceed
straight
to
that
part
of
it
which
he
had
fixed
on
for
his
destination
the
dog
though
if
any
description
of
him
were
out
it
would
not
be
forgotten
that
the
dog
was
missing
and
had
probably
gone
with
him
this
might
lead
to
his
apprehension
as
he
passed
along
the
streets
he
resolved
to
drown
him
and
walked
on
looking
about
for
a
pond
picking
up
a
heavy
stone
and
tying
it
to
his
handkerchief
as
he
went
the
animal
looked
up
into
his
master
face
while
these
preparations
were
making
whether
his
instinct
apprehended
something
of
their
purpose
or
the
robber
sidelong
look
at
him
was
sterner
than
ordinary
he
skulked
a
little
farther
in
the
rear
than
usual
and
cowered
as
he
came
more
slowly
along
when
his
master
halted
at
the
brink
of
a
pool
and
looked
round
to
call
him
he
stopped
outright
you
hear
me
call
come
here

the
animal
came
up
from
the
very
force
of
habit
but
as
sikes
stooped
to
attach
the
handkerchief
to
his
throat
he
uttered
a
low
growl
and
started

the

the
dog
wagged
his
tail
but
moved

sikes
made
a
running
noose
and
called
him
again
the
dog
advanced
retreated
paused
an
instant
and
scoured
away
at
his
hardest
speed
the
man
whistled
again
and
again
and
sat
down
and
waited
in
the
expectation
that
he
would
return
but
no

appeared

at

he
resumed
his
journey
chapter
xlix
monks
and
brownlow
at
length
meet
their
conversation
and
the
intelligence
that
interrupts
it
the
twilight
was
beginning
to
close
in
when
brownlow
alighted
from
a
at
his
own
door
and
knocked
softly
the
door
being
opened
a
sturdy
man
got
out
of
the
coach
and
stationed
himself
on
one
side
of
the
steps
while
another
man
who
had
been
seated
on
the
box
dismounted
too
and
stood
upon
the
other
side
at
a
sign
from
brownlow
they
helped
out
a
third
man
and
taking
him
between
them
hurried
him
into
the
house
this
man
was
monks
they
walked
in
the
same
manner
up
the
stairs
without
speaking
and
brownlow
preceding
them
led
the
way
into
a
at
the
door
of
this
apartment
monks
who
had
ascended
with
evident
reluctance
stopped
the
two
men
looked
at
the
old
gentleman
as
if
for
instructions
knows
the
alternative
said
browlow
he
hesitates
or
moves
a
finger
but
as
you
bid
him
drag
him
into
the
street
call
for
the
aid
of
the
police
and
impeach
him
as
a
felon
in
my
name
dare
you
say
this
of
me
asked
monks
dare
you
urge
me
to
it
young
man
replied
brownlow
confronting
him
with
a
steady
look
you
mad
enough
to
leave
this
house
unhand
him
there
sir
you
are
free
to
go
and
we
to
follow
but
i
warn
you
by
all
i
hold
most
solemn
and
most
sacred
that
instant
will
have
you
apprehended
on
a
charge
of
fraud
and
robbery
i
am
resolute
and
immoveable
if
you
are
determined
to
be
the
same
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
what
authority
am
i
kidnapped
in
the
street
and
brought
here
by
these
dogs
asked
monks
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
men
who
stood
beside
him
mine
replied
brownlow
persons
are
indemnified
by
me
if
you
complain
of
being
deprived
of
your
liberty
you
had
power
and
opportunity
to
retrieve
it
as
you
came
along
but
you
deemed
it
advisable
to
remain
quiet
i
say
again
throw
yourself
for
protection
on
the
law
i
will
appeal
to
the
law
too
but
when
you
have
gone
too
far
to
recede
do
not
sue
to
me
for
leniency
when
the
power
will
have
passed
into
other
hands
and
do
not
say
i
plunged
you
down
the
gulf
into
which
you
rushed
yourself
monks
was
plainly
disconcerted
and
alarmed
besides
he
hesitated
will
decide
quickly
said
brownlow
with
perfect
firmness
and
composure
you
wish
me
to
prefer
my
charges
publicly
and
consign
you
to
a
punishment
the
extent
of
which
although
i
can
with
a
shudder
foresee
i
can
not
control
once
more
i
say
for
you
know
the
way
if
not
and
you
appeal
to
my
forbearance
and
the
mercy
of
those
you
have
deeply
injured
seat
yourself
without
a
word
in
that
chair
it
has
waited
for
you
two
whole
days
monks
muttered
some
unintelligible
words
but
wavered
still
will
be
prompt
said
brownlow
word
from
me
and
the
alternative
has
gone
for
ever
still
the
man
hesitated
have
not
the
inclination
to
parley
said
brownlow
as
i
advocate
the
dearest
interests
of
others
i
have
not
the
right
there
demanded
monks
with
a
faltering
tongue
there
no
middle
course
monks
looked
at
the
old
gentleman
with
an
anxious
eye
but
reading
in
his
countenance
nothing
but
severity
and
determination
walked
into
the
room
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
sat
down
the
door
on
the
outside
said
brownlow
to
the
attendants
come
when
i
ring
the
men
obeyed
and
the
two
were
left
alone
together
is
pretty
treatment
sir
said
monks
throwing
down
his
hat
and
cloak
my
father
oldest
friend
is
because
i
was
your
father
oldest
friend
young
man
returned
brownlow
is
because
the
hopes
and
wishes
of
young
and
happy
years
were
bound
up
with
him
and
that
fair
creature
of
his
blood
and
kindred
who
rejoined
her
god
in
youth
and
left
me
here
a
solitary
lonely
man
it
is
because
he
knelt
with
me
beside
his
only
when
he
was
yet
a
boy
on
the
morning
that
would
but
heaven
willed
otherwise
have
made
her
my
young
wife
it
is
because
my
seared
heart
clung
to
him
from
that
time
forth
through
all
his
trials
and
errors
till
he
died
it
is
because
old
recollections
and
associations
filled
my
heart
and
even
the
sight
of
you
brings
with
it
old
thoughts
of
him
it
is
because
of
all
these
things
that
i
am
moved
to
treat
you
gently
now
yes
edward
leeford
even
now
and
blush
for
your
unworthiness
who
bear
the
name
has
the
name
to
do
with
it
asked
the
other
after
contemplating
half
in
silence
and
half
in
dogged
wonder
the
agitation
of
his
companion
is
the
name
to
me
replied
brownlow
to
you
but
it
was
and
even
at
this
distance
of
time
brings
back
to
me
an
old
man
the
glow
and
thrill
which
i
once
felt
only
to
hear
it
repeated
by
a
stranger
i
am
very
glad
you
have
changed
it
very
very
is
all
mighty
fine
said
monks
to
retain
his
assumed
designation
after
a
long
silence
during
which
he
had
jerked
himself
in
sullen
defiance
to
and
fro
and
brownlow
had
sat
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
what
do
you
want
with
me
have
a
brother
said
brownlow
rousing
himself
brother
the
whisper
of
whose
name
in
your
ear
when
i
came
behind
you
in
the
street
was
in
itself
almost
enough
to
make
you
accompany
me
hither
in
wonder
and
alarm
have
no
brother
replied
monks
know
i
was
an
only
child
why
do
you
talk
to
me
of
brothers
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
to
what
i
do
know
and
you
may
not
said
brownlow
shall
interest
you
by
and
by
i
know
that
of
the
wretched
marriage
into
which
family
pride
and
the
most
sordid
and
narrowest
of
all
ambition
forced
your
unhappy
father
when
a
mere
boy
you
were
the
sole
and
most
unnatural
issue
do
care
for
hard
names
interrupted
monks
with
a
jeering
laugh
know
the
fact
and
that
enough
for
me
i
also
know
pursued
the
old
gentleman
misery
the
slow
torture
the
protracted
anguish
of
that
union
i
know
how
listlessly
and
wearily
each
of
that
wretched
pair
dragged
on
their
heavy
chain
through
a
world
that
was
poisoned
to
them
both
i
know
how
cold
formalities
were
succeeded
by
open
taunts
how
indifference
gave
place
to
dislike
dislike
to
hate
and
hate
to
loathing
until
at
last
they
wrenched
the
clanking
bond
asunder
and
retiring
a
wide
space
apart
carried
each
a
galling
fragment
of
which
nothing
but
death
could
break
the
rivets
to
hide
it
in
new
society
beneath
the
gayest
looks
they
could
assume
your
mother
succeeded
she
forgot
it
soon
but
it
rusted
and
cankered
at
your
father
heart
for
years
they
were
separated
said
monks
what
of
that
they
had
been
separated
for
some
time
returned
brownlow
your
mother
wholly
given
up
to
continental
frivolities
had
utterly
forgotten
the
young
husband
ten
good
years
her
junior
who
with
prospects
blighted
lingered
on
at
home
he
fell
among
new
friends
this
circumstance
at
least
you
know
already
i
said
monks
turning
away
his
eyes
and
beating
his
foot
upon
the
ground
as
a
man
who
is
determined
to
deny
everything
i
manner
no
less
than
your
actions
assures
me
that
you
have
never
forgotten
it
or
ceased
to
think
of
it
with
bitterness
returned
brownlow
speak
of
fifteen
years
ago
when
you
were
not
more
than
eleven
years
old
and
your
father
but
for
he
was
i
repeat
a
boy
when
father
ordered
him
to
marry
must
i
go
back
to
events
which
cast
a
shade
upon
the
memory
of
your
parent
or
will
you
spare
it
and
disclose
to
me
the
truth
have
nothing
to
disclose
rejoined
monks
must
talk
on
if
you
will
new
friends
then
said
brownlow
a
naval
officer
retired
from
active
service
whose
wife
had
died
some
before
and
left
him
with
two
children
there
had
been
more
but
of
all
their
family
happily
but
two
survived
they
were
both
daughters
one
a
beautiful
creature
of
nineteen
and
the
other
a
mere
child
of
two
or
three
years
old
this
to
me
asked
monks
resided
said
brownlow
without
seeming
to
hear
the
interruption
a
part
of
the
country
to
which
your
father
in
his
wandering
had
repaired
and
where
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
acquaintance
intimacy
friendship
fast
followed
on
each
other
your
father
was
gifted
as
few
men
are
he
had
his
sister
soul
and
person
as
the
old
officer
knew
him
more
and
more
he
grew
to
love
him
i
would
that
it
had
ended
there
his
daughter
did
the
same
the
old
gentleman
paused
monks
was
biting
his
lips
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
seeing
this
he
immediately
resumed
end
of
a
year
found
him
contracted
solemnly
contracted
to
that
daughter
the
object
of
the
first
true
ardent
only
passion
of
a
guileless
girl
tale
is
of
the
longest
observed
monks
moving
restlessly
in
his
chair
is
a
true
tale
of
grief
and
trial
and
sorrow
young
man
returned
brownlow
such
tales
usually
are
if
it
were
one
of
unmixed
joy
and
happiness
it
would
be
very
brief
at
length
one
of
those
rich
relations
to
strengthen
whose
interest
and
importance
your
father
had
been
sacrificed
as
others
are
often
it
is
no
uncommon
case
died
and
to
repair
the
misery
he
had
been
instrumental
in
occasioning
left
him
his
panacea
for
all
griefs
money
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
immediately
repair
to
rome
whither
this
man
had
sped
for
health
and
where
he
had
died
leaving
his
affairs
in
great
confusion
he
went
was
seized
with
mortal
illness
there
was
followed
the
moment
the
intelligence
reached
paris
by
your
mother
who
carried
you
with
her
he
died
the
day
after
her
arrival
leaving
no
will
so
that
the
whole
property
fell
to
her
and
you
at
this
part
of
the
recital
monks
held
his
breath
and
listened
with
a
face
of
intense
eagerness
though
his
eyes
were
not
directed
towards
the
speaker
as
brownlow
paused
he
changed
his
position
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
experienced
a
sudden
relief
and
wiped
his
hot
face
and
hands
he
went
abroad
and
as
he
passed
through
london
on
his
way
said
brownlow
slowly
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
other
face
came
to
me
never
heard
of
that
interrupted
monks
in
a
tone
intended
to
appear
incredulous
but
savouring
more
of
disagreeable
surprise
came
to
me
and
left
with
me
among
some
other
things
a
picture
a
portrait
painted
by
himself
a
likeness
of
this
poor
girl
which
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
behind
and
could
not
carry
forward
on
his
hasty
journey
he
was
worn
by
anxiety
and
remorse
almost
to
a
shadow
talked
in
a
wild
distracted
way
of
ruin
and
dishonour
worked
by
himself
confided
to
me
his
intention
to
convert
his
whole
property
at
any
loss
into
money
and
having
settled
on
his
wife
and
you
a
portion
of
his
recent
acquisition
to
fly
the
country
i
guessed
too
well
he
would
not
fly
alone
and
never
see
it
more
even
from
me
his
old
and
early
friend
whose
strong
attachment
had
taken
root
in
the
earth
that
covered
one
most
dear
to
both
even
from
me
he
withheld
any
more
particular
confession
promising
to
write
and
tell
me
all
and
after
that
to
see
me
once
again
for
the
last
time
on
earth
alas
was
the
last
time
i
had
no
letter
and
i
never
saw
him
more
went
said
brownlow
after
a
short
pause
went
when
all
was
over
to
the
scene
of
his
i
will
use
the
term
the
world
would
freely
use
for
worldly
harshness
or
favour
are
now
alike
to
him
of
his
guilty
love
resolved
that
if
my
fears
were
realised
that
erring
child
should
find
one
heart
and
home
to
shelter
and
compassionate
her
the
family
had
left
that
part
a
week
before
they
had
called
in
such
trifling
debts
as
were
outstanding
discharged
them
and
left
the
place
by
night
why
or
whither
none
can
tell
monks
drew
his
breath
yet
more
freely
and
looked
round
with
a
smile
of
triumph
your
brother
said
brownlow
drawing
nearer
to
the
chair
your
brother
a
feeble
ragged
neglected
child
was
cast
in
my
way
by
a
stronger
hand
than
chance
and
rescued
by
me
from
a
life
of
vice
and
infamy
cried
monks
me
said
brownlow
told
you
i
should
interest
you
before
long
i
say
by
me
i
see
that
your
cunning
associate
suppressed
my
name
although
for
ought
he
knew
it
would
be
quite
strange
to
your
ears
when
he
was
rescued
by
me
then
and
lay
recovering
from
sickness
in
my
house
his
strong
resemblance
to
this
picture
i
have
spoken
of
struck
me
with
astonishment
even
when
i
first
saw
him
in
all
his
dirt
and
misery
there
was
a
lingering
expression
in
his
face
that
came
upon
me
like
a
glimpse
of
some
old
friend
flashing
on
one
in
a
vivid
dream
i
need
not
tell
you
he
was
snared
away
before
i
knew
his
history
not
asked
monks
hastily
you
know
it
well
to
me
is
vain
replied
brownlow
shall
show
you
that
i
know
more
than
that
you
ca
prove
anything
against
me
stammered
monks
defy
you
to
do
it
shall
see
returned
the
old
gentleman
with
a
searching
glance
lost
the
boy
and
no
efforts
of
mine
could
recover
him
your
mother
being
dead
i
knew
that
you
alone
could
solve
the
mystery
if
anybody
could
and
as
when
i
had
last
heard
of
you
you
were
on
your
own
estate
in
the
west
indies
whither
as
you
well
know
you
retired
upon
your
mother
death
to
escape
the
consequences
of
vicious
courses
here
i
made
the
voyage
you
had
left
it
months
before
and
were
supposed
to
be
in
london
but
no
one
could
tell
where
i
returned
your
agents
had
no
clue
to
your
residence
you
came
and
went
they
said
as
strangely
as
you
had
ever
done
sometimes
for
days
together
and
sometimes
not
for
months
keeping
to
all
appearance
the
same
low
haunts
and
mingling
with
the
same
infamous
herd
who
had
been
your
associates
when
a
fierce
ungovernable
boy
i
wearied
them
with
new
applications
i
paced
the
streets
by
night
and
day
but
until
two
hours
ago
all
my
efforts
were
fruitless
and
i
never
saw
you
for
an
instant
now
you
do
see
me
said
monks
rising
boldly
then
fraud
and
robbery
are
words
justified
you
think
by
a
fancied
resemblance
in
some
young
imp
to
an
idle
daub
of
a
dead
man
brother
you
do
even
know
that
a
child
was
born
of
this
maudlin
pair
you
do
even
know
that
replied
brownlow
rising
too
within
the
last
fortnight
i
have
learnt
it
all
you
have
a
brother
you
know
it
and
him
there
was
a
will
which
your
mother
destroyed
leaving
the
secret
and
the
gain
to
you
at
her
own
death
it
contained
a
reference
to
some
child
likely
to
be
the
result
of
this
sad
connection
which
child
was
born
and
accidentally
encountered
by
you
when
your
suspicions
were
first
awakened
by
his
resemblance
to
your
father
you
repaired
to
the
place
of
his
birth
there
existed
proofs
proofs
long
suppressed
of
his
birth
and
parentage
those
proofs
were

you

you
whose

brought
a
violent
death
upon
the
head
of
one
worth
millions
such
as
you
you
who
from
your

were
gall
and
bitterness
to
your
own
heart
and
in
whom
all
evil
passions
vice
and
profligacy
festered
till
they
found
a
vent
in
a
hideous
disease
which
had
made
your

you
edward

do
you
still

no
no

the
coward
overwhelmed
by
these

the

this
detested
villain
is
known
to
me
shadows
on
the
wall
have
caught
your
whispers
and
brought
them
to
my
ear
the
sight
of
the
persecuted
child
has
turned
vice
itself
and
given
it
the
courage
and
almost
the
attributes
of
virtue
murder
has
been
done
to
which
you
were
morally
if
not
really
a
party
no
interposed
monks
i
knew
nothing
of
that
i
was
going
to
inquire
the
truth
of
the
story
when
you
overtook
me
i
did
know
the
cause
i
thought
it
was
a
common
quarrel
was
the
partial
disclosure
of
your
secrets
replied
brownlow
you
disclose
the
whole
i
will
your
hand
to
a
statement
of
truth
and
facts
and
repeat
it
before
witnesses
i
promise
too
quietly
here
until
such
a
document
is
drawn
up
and
proceed
with
me
to
such
a
place
as
i
may
deem
most
advisable
for
the
purpose
of
attesting
it
you
insist
upon
that
i
do
that
also
replied
monks
must
do
more
than
that
said
brownlow
restitution
to
an
innocent
and
unoffending
child
for
such
he
is
although
the
offspring
of
a
guilty
and
most
miserable
love
you
have
not
forgotten
the
provisions
of
the
will
carry
them
into
execution
so
far
as
your
brother
is
concerned
and
then
go
where
you
please
in
this
world
you
need
meet
no
more
while
monks
was
pacing
up
and
down
meditating
with
dark
and
evil
looks
on
this
proposal
and
the
possibilities
of
evading
it
torn
by
his
fears
on
the
one
hand
and
his
hatred
on
the
other
the
door
was
hurriedly
unlocked
and
a
gentleman
losberne
entered
the
room
in
violent
agitation
man
will
be
taken
he
cried
will
be
taken
murderer
asked
brownlow
yes
replied
the
other
dog
has
been
seen
lurking
about
some
old
haunt
and
there
seems
little
doubt
that
his
master
either
is
or
will
be
there
under
cover
of
the
darkness
spies
are
hovering
about
in
every
direction
i
have
spoken
to
the
men
who
are
charged
with
his
capture
and
they
tell
me
he
can
not
escape
a
reward
of
a
hundred
pounds
is
proclaimed
by
government
will
give
fifty
more
said
brownlow
proclaim
it
with
my
own
lips
upon
the
spot
if
i
can
reach
it
where
is
mr
maylie
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
your
friend
here
safe
in
a
coach
with
you
he
hurried
off
to
where
he
heard
this
replied
the
doctor
mounting
his
horse
sallied
forth
to
join
the
first
party
at
some
place
in
the
outskirts
agreed
upon
between
them
said
brownlow
of
him
i
last
heard
he
had
not
been
taken
but
he
will
be
or
is
by
this
time
they
sure
of
him
you
made
up
your
mind
asked
brownlow
in
a
low
voice
of
monks
he
replied
you
will
be
secret
with
me
will
remain
here
till
i
return
it
is
your
only
hope
of
safety
they
left
the
room
and
the
door
was
again
locked
have
you
done
asked
the
doctor
in
a
whisper
that
i
could
hope
to
do
and
even
more
coupling
the
poor
intelligence
with
my
previous
knowledge
and
the
result
of
our
good
friend
inquiries
on
the
spot
i
left
him
no
loophole
of
escape
and
laid
bare
the
whole
villainy
which
by
these
lights
became
plain
as
day
write
and
appoint
the
evening
after
at
seven
for
the
meeting
we
shall
be
down
there
a
few
hours
before
but
shall
require
rest
especially
the
young
lady
who
have
greater
need
of
firmness
than
either
you
or
i
can
quite
foresee
just
now
but
my
blood
boils
to
avenge
this
poor
murdered
creature
which
way
have
they
taken
straight
to
the
office
and
you
will
be
in
time
replied
losberne
will
remain
here
the
two
gentlemen
hastily
separated
each
in
a
fever
of
excitement
wholly
uncontrollable
chapter
l
the
pursuit
and
escape
near
to
that
part
of
the
thames
on
which
the
church
at
rotherhithe
abuts
where
the
buildings
on
the
banks
are
dirtiest
and
the
vessels
on
the
river
blackest
with
the
dust
of
colliers
and
the
smoke
of
houses
there
exists
the
filthiest
the
strangest
the
most
extraordinary
of
the
many
localities
that
are
hidden
in
london
wholly
unknown
even
by
name
to
the
great
mass
of
its
inhabitants
to
reach
this
place
the
visitor
has
to
penetrate
through
a
maze
of
close
narrow
and
muddy
streets
thronged
by
the
roughest
and
poorest
of
waterside
people
and
devoted
to
the
traffic
they
may
be
supposed
to
occasion
the
cheapest
and
least
delicate
provisions
are
heaped
in
the
shops
the
coarsest
and
commonest
articles
of
wearing
apparel
dangle
at
the
salesman
door
and
stream
from
the
and
windows
jostling
with
unemployed
labourers
of
the
lowest
class
brazen
women
ragged
children
and
the
raff
and
refuse
of
the
river
he
makes
his
way
with
difficulty
along
assailed
by
offensive
sights
and
smells
from
the
narrow
alleys
which
branch
off
on
the
right
and
left
and
deafened
by
the
clash
of
ponderous
waggons
that
bear
great
piles
of
merchandise
from
the
stacks
of
warehouses
that
rise
from
every
corner
arriving
at
length
in
streets
remoter
and
than
those
through
which
he
has
passed
he
walks
beneath
tottering
projecting
over
the
pavement
dismantled
walls
that
seem
to
totter
as
he
passes
chimneys
half
crushed
half
hesitating
to
fall
windows
guarded
by
rusty
iron
bars
that
time
and
dirt
have
almost
eaten
away
every
imaginable
sign
of
desolation
and
neglect
in
such
a
neighborhood
beyond
dockhead
in
the
borough
of
southwark
stands
jacob
island
surrounded
by
a
muddy
ditch
six
or
eight
feet
deep
and
fifteen
or
twenty
wide
when
the
tide
is
in
once
called
mill
pond
but
known
in
the
days
of
this
story
as
folly
ditch
it
is
a
creek
or
inlet
from
the
thames
and
can
always
be
filled
at
high
water
by
opening
the
sluices
at
the
lead
mills
from
which
it
took
its
old
name
at
such
times
a
stranger
looking
from
one
of
the
wooden
bridges
thrown
across
it
at
mill
lane
will
see
the
inhabitants
of
the
houses
on
either
side
lowering
from
their
back
doors
and
windows
buckets
pails
domestic
utensils
of
all
kinds
in
which
to
haul
the
water
up
and
when
his
eye
is
turned
from
these
operations
to
the
houses
themselves
his
utmost
astonishment
will
be
excited
by
the
scene
before
him
crazy
wooden
galleries
common
to
the
backs
of
half
a
dozen
houses
with
holes
from
which
to
look
upon
the
slime
beneath
windows
broken
and
patched
with
poles
thrust
out
on
which
to
dry
the
linen
that
is
never
there
rooms
so
small
so
filthy
so
confined
that
the
air
would
seem
too
tainted
even
for
the
dirt
and
squalor
which
they
shelter
wooden
chambers
thrusting
themselves
out
above
the
mud
and
threatening
to
fall
into
it
as
some
have
done
walls
and
decaying
foundations
every
repulsive
lineament
of
poverty
every
loathsome
indication
of
filth
rot
and
garbage
all
these
ornament
the
banks
of
folly
ditch
in
jacob
island
the
warehouses
are
roofless
and
empty
the
walls
are
crumbling
down
the
windows
are
windows
no
more
the
doors
are
falling
into
the
streets
the
chimneys
are
blackened
but
they
yield
no
smoke
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
before
losses
and
chancery
suits
came
upon
it
it
was
a
thriving
place
but
now
it
is
a
desolate
island
indeed
the
houses
have
no
owners
they
are
broken
open
and
entered
upon
by
those
who
have
the
courage
and
there
they
live
and
there
they
die
they
must
have
powerful
motives
for
a
secret
residence
or
be
reduced
to
a
destitute
condition
indeed
who
seek
a
refuge
in
jacob
island
in
an
upper
room
of
one
of
these
houses
a
detached
house
of
fair
size
ruinous
in
other
respects
but
strongly
defended
at
door
and
window
of
which
house
the
back
commanded
the
ditch
in
manner
already
described
there
were
assembled
three
men
who
regarding
each
other
every
now
and
then
with
looks
expressive
of
perplexity
and
expectation
sat
for
some
time
in
profound
and
gloomy
silence
one
of
these
was
toby
crackit
another
chitling
and
the
third
a
robber
of
fifty
years
whose
nose
had
been
almost
beaten
in
in
some
old
scuffle
and
whose
face
bore
a
frightful
scar
which
might
probably
be
traced
to
the
same
occasion
this
man
was
a
returned
transport
and
his
name
was
kags
wish
said
toby
turning
to
chitling
you
had
picked
out
some
other
crib
when
the
two
old
ones
got
too
warm
and
had
not
come
here
my
fine
feller
did
you
said
kags
i
thought
you
have
been
a
little
more
glad
to
see
me
than
this
replied
chitling
with
a
melancholy
air
young
gentleman
said
toby
a
man
keeps
himself
so
very
as
i
have
done
and
by
that
means
has
a
snug
house
over
his
head
with
nobody
a
prying
and
smelling
about
it
it
rather
a
startling
thing
to
have
the
honour
of
a
wisit
from
a
young
gentleman
however
respectable
and
pleasant
a
person
he
may
be
to
play
cards
with
at
conweniency
circumstanced
as
you
are
when
the
exclusive
young
man
has
got
a
friend
stopping
with
him
that
arrived
sooner
than
was
expected
from
foreign
parts
and
is
too
modest
to
want
to
be
presented
to
the
judges
on
his
return
added
kags
there
was
a
short
silence
after
which
toby
crackit
seeming
to
abandon
as
hopeless
any
further
effort
to
maintain
his
usual
swagger
turned
to
chitling
and
said
was
fagin
took
then
at
two
this
afternoon
charley
and
i
made
our
lucky
up
the
chimney
and
bolter
got
into
the
empty
head
downwards
but
his
legs
were
so
precious
long
that
they
stuck
out
at
the
top
and
so
they
took
him
too
bet
bet
she
went
to
see
the
body
to
speak
to
who
it
was
replied
chitling
his
countenance
falling
more
and
more
went
off
mad
screaming
and
raving
and
beating
her
head
against
the
boards
so
they
put
a
on
her
and
took
her
to
the
hospital
and
there
she
is
come
of
young
bates
demanded
kags
hung
about
not
to
come
over
here
afore
dark
but
he
be
here
soon
replied
chitling
nowhere
else
to
go
to
now
for
the
people
at
the
cripples
are
all
in
custody
and
the
bar
of
the
ken
i
went
up
there
and
see
it
with
my
own
eyes
is
filled
with
traps
is
a
smash
observed
toby
biting
his
lips
more
than
one
will
go
with
this
sessions
are
on
said
kags
they
get
the
inquest
over
and
bolter
turns
king
evidence
as
of
course
he
will
from
what
said
already
they
can
prove
fagin
an
accessory
before
the
fact
and
get
the
trial
on
on
friday
and
he
swing
in
six
days
from
this
by
g
should
have
heard
the
people
groan
said
chitling
officers
fought
like
devils
or
they
have
torn
him
away
he
was
down
once
but
they
made
a
ring
round
him
and
fought
their
way
along
you
should
have
seen
how
he
looked
about
him
all
muddy
and
bleeding
and
clung
to
them
as
if
they
were
his
dearest
friends
i
can
see
now
not
able
to
stand
upright
with
the
pressing
of
the
mob
and
draggin
him
along
amongst
i
can
see
the
people
jumping
up
one
behind
another
and
snarling
with
their
teeth
and
making
at
him
i
can
see
the
blood
upon
his
hair
and
beard
and
hear
the
cries
with
which
the
women
worked
themselves
into
the
centre
of
the
crowd
at
the
street
corner
and
swore
they
tear
his
heart
out
the
witness
of
this
scene
pressed
his
hands
upon
his
ears
and
with
his
eyes
closed
got
up
and
paced
violently
to
and
fro
like
one
distracted
while
he
was
thus
engaged
and
the
two
men
sat
by
in
silence
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
a
pattering
noise
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
sikes
dog
bounded
into
the
room
they
ran
to
the
window
downstairs
and
into
the
street
the
dog
had
jumped
in
at
an
open
window
he
made
no
attempt
to
follow
them
nor
was
his
master
to
be
seen
the
meaning
of
this
said
toby
when
they
had
returned
ca
be
coming
here
i
i
hope
not
he
was
coming
here
he
have
come
with
the
dog
said
kags
stooping
down
to
examine
the
animal
who
lay
panting
on
the
floor
give
us
some
water
for
him
he
has
run
himself
faint
drunk
it
all
up
every
drop
said
chitling
after
watching
the
dog
some
time
in
silence
with
mud
lame
half
blind
he
must
have
come
a
long
way
can
he
have
come
from
exclaimed
toby
been
to
the
other
kens
of
course
and
finding
them
filled
with
strangers
come
on
here
where
he
been
many
a
time
and
often
but
where
can
he
have
come
from
first
and
how
comes
he
here
alone
without
the
other
none
of
them
called
the
murderer
by
his
old
name
have
made
away
with
himself
what
do
you
think
said
chitling
toby
shook
his
head
he
had
said
kags
dog
want
to
lead
us
away
to
where
he
did
it
no
i
think
he
got
out
of
the
country
and
left
the
dog
behind
he
must
have
given
him
the
slip
somehow
or
he
would
be
so
easy
this
solution
appearing
the
most
probable
one
was
adopted
as
the
right
the
dog
creeping
under
a
chair
coiled
himself
up
to
sleep
without
more
notice
from
anybody
it
being
now
dark
the
shutter
was
closed
and
a
candle
lighted
and
placed
upon
the
table
the
terrible
events
of
the
last
two
days
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
all
three
increased
by
the
danger
and
uncertainty
of
their
own
position
they
drew
their
chairs
closer
together
starting
at
every
sound
they
spoke
little
and
that
in
whispers
and
were
as
silent
and
as
if
the
remains
of
the
murdered
woman
lay
in
the
next
room
they
had
sat
thus
some
time
when
suddenly
was
heard
a
hurried
knocking
at
the
door
below
bates
said
kags
looking
angrily
round
to
check
the
fear
he
felt
himself
the
knocking
came
again
no
it
was
he
he
never
knocked
like
that
crackit
went
to
the
window
and
shaking
all
over
drew
in
his
head
there
was
no
need
to
tell
them
who
it
was
his
pale
face
was
enough
the
dog
too
was
on
the
alert
in
an
instant
and
ran
whining
to
the
door
must
let
him
in
he
said
taking
up
the
candle
there
any
help
for
it
asked
the
other
man
in
a
hoarse
voice
he
come
in
leave
us
in
the
dark
said
kags
taking
down
a
candle
from
the
and
lighting
it
with
such
a
trembling
hand
that
the
knocking
was
twice
repeated
before
he
had
finished
crackit
went
down
to
the
door
and
returned
followed
by
a
man
with
the
lower
part
of
his
face
buried
in
a
handkerchief
and
another
tied
over
his
head
under
his
hat
he
drew
them
slowly
off
blanched
face
sunken
eyes
hollow
cheeks
beard
of
three
days
growth
wasted
flesh
short
thick
breath
it
was
the
very
ghost
of
sikes
he
laid
his
hand
upon
a
chair
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
but
shuddering
as
he
was
about
to
drop
into
it
and
seeming
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
dragged
it
back
close
to
the
wall
as
close
as
it
would
go
and
ground
it
against
it
and
sat
down
not
a
word
had
been
exchanged
he
looked
from
one
to
another
in
silence
if
an
eye
were
furtively
raised
and
met
his
it
was
instantly
averted
when
his
hollow
voice
broke
silence
they
all
three
started
they
seemed
never
to
have
heard
its
tones
before
came
that
dog
here
he
asked
three
hours
ago
paper
says
that
fagin
took
is
it
true
or
a
lie
they
were
silent
again
you
all
said
sikes
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
there
was
an
uneasy
movement
among
them
but
nobody
spoke
that
keep
this
house
said
sikes
turning
his
face
to
crackit
you
mean
to
sell
me
or
to
let
me
lie
here
till
this
hunt
is
over
may
stop
here
if
you
think
it
safe
returned
the
person
addressed
after
some
hesitation
sikes
carried
his
eyes
slowly
up
the
wall
behind
him
rather
trying
to
turn
his
head
than
actually
doing
it
and
said
it
the
body
is
it
buried
they
shook
their
heads
is
it
he
retorted
with
the
same
glance
behind
him
do
they
keep
such
ugly
things
above
the
ground
for
who
that
knocking
crackit
intimated
by
a
motion
of
his
hand
as
he
left
the
room
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
and
directly
came
back
with
charley
bates
behind
him
sikes
sat
opposite
the
door
so
that
the
moment
the
boy
entered
the
room
he
encountered
his
figure
said
the
boy
falling
back
as
sikes
turned
his
eyes
towards
him
did
you
tell
me
this
downstairs
there
had
been
something
so
tremendous
in
the
shrinking
off
of
the
three
that
the
wretched
man
was
willing
to
propitiate
even
this
lad
accordingly
he
nodded
and
made
as
though
he
would
shake
hands
with
him
me
go
into
some
other
room
said
the
boy
retreating
still
farther
said
sikes
stepping
forward
you
do
you
know
me
come
nearer
me
answered
the
boy
still
retreating
and
looking
with
horror
in
his
eyes
upon
the
murderer
face
monster
the
man
stopped
and
they
looked
at
each
other
but
eyes
sunk
gradually
to
the
ground
you
three
cried
the
boy
shaking
his
clenched
fist
and
becoming
more
and
more
excited
as
he
spoke
you
three
i
not
afraid
of
him
if
they
come
here
after
him
i
give
him
up
i
will
i
tell
you
out
at
once
he
may
kill
me
for
it
if
he
likes
or
if
he
dares
but
if
i
am
here
i
give
him
up
i
give
him
up
if
he
was
to
be
boiled
alive
murder
help
if
there
the
pluck
of
a
man
among
you
three
you
help
me
murder
help
down
with
him
pouring
out
these
cries
and
accompanying
them
with
violent
gesticulation
the
boy
actually
threw
himself
upon
the
strong
man
and
in
the
intensity
of
his
energy
and
the
suddenness
of
his
surprise
brought
him
heavily
to
the
ground
the
three
spectators
seemed
quite
stupefied
they
offered
no
interference
and
the
boy
and
man
rolled
on
the
ground
together
the
former
heedless
of
the
blows
that
showered
upon
him
wrenching
his
hands
tighter
and
tighter
in
the
garments
about
the
murderer
breast
and
never
ceasing
to
call
for
help
with
all
his
might
the
contest
however
was
too
unequal
to
last
long
sikes
had
him
down
and
his
knee
was
on
his
throat
when
crackit
pulled
him
back
with
a
look
of
alarm
and
pointed
to
the
window
there
were
lights
gleaming
below
voices
in
loud
and
earnest
conversation
the
tramp
of
hurried
footsteps
endless
they
seemed
in
number
crossing
the
nearest
wooden
bridge
one
man
on
horseback
seemed
to
be
among
the
crowd
for
there
was
the
noise
of
hoofs
rattling
on
the
uneven
pavement
the
gleam
of
lights
increased
the
footsteps
came
more
thickly
and
noisily
on
then
came
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
and
then
a
hoarse
murmur
from
such
a
multitude
of
angry
voices
as
would
have
made
the
boldest
quail
shrieked
the
boy
in
a
voice
that
rent
the
air
here
break
down
the
door
the
king
name
cried
the
voices
without
and
the
hoarse
cry
arose
again
but
louder
down
the
door
screamed
the
boy
tell
you
they
never
open
it
run
straight
to
the
room
where
the
light
is
break
down
the
door
strokes
thick
and
heavy
rattled
upon
the
door
and
lower
as
he
ceased
to
speak
and
a
loud
huzzah
burst
from
the
crowd
giving
the
listener
for
the
first
time
some
adequate
idea
of
its
immense
extent
the
door
of
some
place
where
i
can
lock
this
screeching
cried
sikes
fiercely
running
to
and
fro
and
dragging
the
boy
now
as
easily
as
if
he
were
an
empty
sack
door
quick
he
flung
him
in
bolted
it
and
turned
the
key
the
downstairs
door
fast
and
chained
replied
crackit
who
with
the
other
two
men
still
remained
quite
helpless
and
bewildered
panels
are
they
strong
with
the
windows
too
and
the
windows
you
cried
the
desperate
ruffian
throwing
up
the
sash
and
menacing
the
crowd
your
worst
i
cheat
you
yet
of
all
the
terrific
yells
that
ever
fell
on
mortal
ears
none
could
exceed
the
cry
of
the
infuriated
throng
some
shouted
to
those
who
were
nearest
to
set
the
house
on
fire
others
roared
to
the
officers
to
shoot
him
dead
among
them
all
none
showed
such
fury
as
the
man
on
horseback
who
throwing
himself
out
of
the
saddle
and
bursting
through
the
crowd
as
if
he
were
parting
water
cried
beneath
the
window
in
a
voice
that
rose
above
all
others
guineas
to
the
man
who
brings
a
ladder
the
nearest
voices
took
up
the
cry
and
hundreds
echoed
it
some
called
for
ladders
some
for
some
ran
with
torches
to
and
fro
as
if
to
seek
them
and
still
came
back
and
roared
again
some
spent
their
breath
in
impotent
curses
and
execrations
some
pressed
forward
with
the
ecstasy
of
madmen
and
thus
impeded
the
progress
of
those
below
some
among
the
boldest
attempted
to
climb
up
by
the
and
crevices
in
the
wall
and
all
waved
to
and
fro
in
the
darkness
beneath
like
a
field
of
corn
moved
by
an
angry
wind
and
joined
from
time
to
time
in
one
loud
furious
roar
tide
cried
the
murderer
as
he
staggered
back
into
the
room
and
shut
the
faces
out
tide
was
in
as
i
came
up
give
me
a
rope
a
long
rope
they
all
in
front
i
may
drop
into
the
folly
ditch
and
clear
off
that
way
give
me
a
rope
or
i
shall
do
three
more
murders
and
kill
myself
the
men
pointed
to
where
such
articles
were
kept
the
murderer
hastily
selecting
the
longest
and
strongest
cord
hurried
up
to
the
all
the
window
in
the
rear
of
the
house
had
been
long
ago
bricked
up
except
one
small
trap
in
the
room
where
the
boy
was
locked
and
that
was
too
small
even
for
the
passage
of
his
body
but
from
this
aperture
he
had
never
ceased
to
call
on
those
without
to
guard
the
back
and
thus
when
the
murderer
emerged
at
last
on
the
by
the
door
in
the
roof
a
loud
shout
proclaimed
the
fact
to
those
in
front
who
immediately
began
to
pour
round
pressing
upon
each
other
in
an
unbroken
stream
he
planted
a
board
which
he
had
carried
up
with
him
for
the
purpose
so
firmly
against
the
door
that
it
must
be
matter
of
great
difficulty
to
open
it
from
the
inside
and
creeping
over
the
tiles
looked
over
the
low
parapet
the
water
was
out
and
the
ditch
a
bed
of
mud
the
crowd
had
been
hushed
during
these
few
moments
watching
his
motions
and
doubtful
of
his
purpose
but
the
instant
they
perceived
it
and
knew
it
was
defeated
they
raised
a
cry
of
triumphant
execration
to
which
all
their
previous
shouting
had
been
whispers
again
and
again
it
rose
those
who
were
at
too
great
a
distance
to
know
its
meaning
took
up
the
sound
it
echoed
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
city
had
poured
its
population
out
to
curse
him
on
pressed
the
people
from
the
front
on
on
on
in
a
strong
struggling
current
of
angry
faces
with
here
and
there
a
glaring
torch
to
lighten
them
up
and
show
them
out
in
all
their
wrath
and
passion
the
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
ditch
had
been
entered
by
the
mob
sashes
were
thrown
up
or
torn
bodily
out
there
were
tiers
and
tiers
of
faces
in
every
window
cluster
upon
cluster
of
people
clinging
to
every
each
little
bridge
and
there
were
three
in
sight
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
the
crowd
upon
it
still
the
current
poured
on
to
find
some
nook
or
hole
from
which
to
vent
their
shouts
and
only
for
an
instant
see
the
wretch
have
him
now
cried
a
man
on
the
nearest
bridge
the
crowd
grew
light
with
uncovered
heads
and
again
the
shout
uprose
will
give
fifty
pounds
cried
an
old
gentleman
from
the
same
quarter
the
man
who
takes
him
alive
i
will
remain
here
till
he
come
to
ask
me
for
it
there
was
another
roar
at
this
moment
the
word
was
passed
among
the
crowd
that
the
door
was
forced
at
last
and
that
he
who
had
first
called
for
the
ladder
had
mounted
into
the
room
the
stream
abruptly
turned
as
this
intelligence
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
the
people
at
the
windows
seeing
those
upon
the
bridges
pouring
back
quitted
their
stations
and
running
into
the
street
joined
the
concourse
that
now
thronged
to
the
spot
they
had
left
each
man
crushing
and
striving
with
his
neighbor
and
all
panting
with
impatience
to
get
near
the
door
and
look
upon
the
criminal
as
the
officers
brought
him
out
the
cries
and
shrieks
of
those
who
were
pressed
almost
to
suffocation
or
trampled
down
and
trodden
under
foot
in
the
confusion
were
dreadful
the
narrow
ways
were
completely
blocked
up
and
at
this
time
between
the
rush
of
some
to
regain
the
space
in
front
of
the
house
and
the
unavailing
struggles
of
others
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
mass
the
immediate
attention
was
distracted
from
the
murderer
although
the
universal
eagerness
for
his
capture
was
if
possible
increased
the
man
had
shrunk
down
thoroughly
quelled
by
the
ferocity
of
the
crowd
and
the
impossibility
of
escape
but
seeing
this
sudden
change
with
no
less
rapidity
than
it
had
occurred
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
determined
to
make
one
last
effort
for
his
life
by
dropping
into
the
ditch
and
at
the
risk
of
being
stifled
endeavouring
to
creep
away
in
the
darkness
and
confusion
roused
into
new
strength
and
energy
and
stimulated
by
the
noise
within
the
house
which
announced
that
an
entrance
had
really
been
effected
he
set
his
foot
against
the
stack
of
chimneys
fastened
one
end
of
the
rope
tightly
and
firmly
round
it
and
with
the
other
made
a
strong
running
noose
by
the
aid
of
his
hands
and
teeth
almost
in
a
second
he
could
let
himself
down
by
the
cord
to
within
a
less
distance
of
the
ground
than
his
own
height
and
had
his
knife
ready
in
his
hand
to
cut
it
then
and
drop
at
the
very
instant
when
he
brought
the
loop
over
his
head
previous
to
slipping
it
beneath
his
and
when
the
old
gentleman
who
had
clung
so
tight
to
the
railing
of
the
bridge
as
to
resist
the
force
of
the
crowd
and
retain
his
position
earnestly
warned
those
about
him
that
the
man
was
about
to
lower
himself
down
at
that
very
instant
the
murderer
looking
behind
him
on
the
roof
threw
his
arms
above
his
head
and
uttered
a
yell
of
terror
eyes
again
he
cried
in
an
unearthly
screech
staggering
as
if
struck
by
lightning
he
lost
his
balance
and
tumbled
over
the
parapet
the
noose
was
on
his
neck
it
ran
up
with
his
weight
tight
as
a
and
swift
as
the
arrow
it
speeds
he
fell
for
feet
there
was
a
sudden
jerk
a
terrific
convulsion
of
the
limbs
and
there
he
hung
with
the
open
knife
clenched
in
his
stiffening
hand
the
old
chimney
quivered
with
the
shock
but
stood
it
bravely
the
murderer
swung
lifeless
against
the
wall
and
the
boy
thrusting
aside
the
dangling
body
which
obscured
his
view
called
to
the
people
to
come
and
take
him
out
for
god
sake
a
dog
which
had
lain
concealed
till
now
ran
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
parapet
with
a
dismal
howl
and
collecting
himself
for
a
spring
jumped
for
the
dead
man
shoulders
missing
his
aim
he
fell
into
the
ditch
turning
completely
over
as
he
went
and
striking
his
head
against
a
stone
dashed
out
his
brains
chapter
li
affording
an
explanation
of
more
mysteries
than
one
and
comprehending
a
proposal
of
marriage
with
no
word
of
settlement
or
the
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
were
yet
but
two
days
old
when
oliver
found
himself
at
three
in
the
afternoon
in
a
rolling
fast
towards
his
native
town
maylie
and
rose
and
bedwin
and
the
good
doctor
were
with
him
and
brownlow
followed
in
a
accompanied
by
one
other
person
whose
name
had
not
been
mentioned
they
had
not
talked
much
upon
the
way
for
oliver
was
in
a
flutter
of
agitation
and
uncertainty
which
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
collecting
his
thoughts
and
almost
of
speech
and
appeared
to
have
scarcely
less
effect
on
his
companions
who
shared
it
in
at
least
an
equal
degree
he
and
the
two
ladies
had
been
very
carefully
made
acquainted
by
brownlow
with
the
nature
of
the
admissions
which
had
been
forced
from
monks
and
although
they
knew
that
the
object
of
their
present
journey
was
to
complete
the
work
which
had
been
so
well
begun
still
the
whole
matter
was
enveloped
in
enough
of
doubt
and
mystery
to
leave
them
in
endurance
of
the
most
intense
suspense
the
same
kind
friend
had
with
losberne
assistance
cautiously
stopped
all
channels
of
communication
through
which
they
could
receive
intelligence
of
the
dreadful
occurrences
that
so
recently
taken
place
was
quite
true
he
said
they
must
know
them
before
long
but
it
might
be
at
a
better
time
than
the
present
and
it
could
not
be
at
a
worse
so
they
travelled
on
in
silence
each
busied
with
reflections
on
the
object
which
had
brought
them
together
and
no
one
disposed
to
give
utterance
to
the
thoughts
which
crowded
upon
all
but
if
oliver
under
these
influences
had
remained
silent
while
they
journeyed
towards
his
by
a
road
he
had
never
seen
how
the
whole
current
of
his
recollections
ran
back
to
old
times
and
what
a
crowd
of
emotions
were
wakened
up
in
his
breast
when
they
turned
into
that
which
he
had
traversed
on
foot
a
poor
houseless
wandering
boy
without
a
friend
to
help
him
or
a
roof
to
shelter
his
head
there
there
cried
oliver
eagerly
clasping
the
hand
of
rose
and
pointing
out
at
the
carriage
window
the
stile
i
came
over
there
are
the
hedges
i
crept
behind
for
fear
any
one
should
overtake
me
and
force
me
back
yonder
is
the
path
across
the
fields
leading
to
the
old
house
where
i
was
a
little
child
oh
dick
dick
my
dear
old
friend
if
i
could
only
see
you
now
will
see
him
soon
replied
rose
gently
taking
his
folded
hands
between
her
own
shall
tell
him
how
happy
you
are
and
how
rich
you
have
grown
and
that
in
all
your
happiness
you
have
none
so
great
as
the
coming
back
to
make
him
happy
too
yes
said
oliver
we
we
take
him
away
from
here
and
have
him
clothed
and
taught
and
send
him
to
some
quiet
country
place
where
he
may
grow
strong
and
well
shall
we
rose
nodded
for
the
boy
was
smiling
through
such
happy
tears
that
she
could
not
speak
will
be
kind
and
good
to
him
for
you
are
to
every
one
said
oliver
will
make
you
cry
i
know
to
hear
what
he
can
tell
but
never
mind
never
mind
it
will
be
all
over
and
you
will
smile
again
i
know
that
too
to
think
how
changed
he
is
you
did
the
same
with
me
he
said
god
bless
you
to
me
when
i
ran
away
cried
the
boy
with
a
burst
of
affectionate
emotion
i
will
say
god
bless
you
now
and
show
him
how
i
love
him
for
it
as
they
approached
the
town
and
at
length
drove
through
its
narrow
streets
it
became
matter
of
no
small
difficulty
to
restrain
the
boy
within
reasonable
bounds
there
was
sowerberry
the
undertaker
just
as
it
used
to
be
only
smaller
and
less
imposing
in
appearance
than
he
remembered
it
there
were
all
the
shops
and
houses
with
almost
every
one
of
which
he
had
some
slight
incident
connected
there
was
gamfield
cart
the
very
cart
he
used
to
have
standing
at
the
old
door
there
was
the
workhouse
the
dreary
prison
of
his
youthful
days
with
its
dismal
windows
frowning
on
the
street
there
was
the
same
lean
porter
standing
at
the
gate
at
sight
of
whom
oliver
involuntarily
shrunk
back
and
then
laughed
at
himself
for
being
so
foolish
then
cried
then
laughed
again
there
were
scores
of
faces
at
the
doors
and
windows
that
he
knew
quite
well
there
was
nearly
everything
as
if
he
had
left
it
but
yesterday
and
all
his
recent
life
had
been
but
a
happy
dream
but
it
was
pure
earnest
joyful
reality
they
drove
straight
to
the
door
of
the
chief
hotel
which
oliver
used
to
stare
up
at
with
awe
and
think
a
mighty
palace
but
which
had
somehow
fallen
off
in
grandeur
and
size
and
here
was
grimwig
all
ready
to
receive
them
kissing
the
young
lady
and
the
old
one
too
when
they
got
out
of
the
coach
as
if
he
were
the
grandfather
of
the
whole
party
all
smiles
and
kindness
and
not
offering
to
eat
his
head
no
not
once
not
even
when
he
contradicted
a
very
old
postboy
about
the
nearest
road
to
london
and
maintained
he
knew
it
best
though
he
had
only
come
that
way
once
and
that
time
fast
asleep
there
was
dinner
prepared
and
there
were
bedrooms
ready
and
everything
was
arranged
as
if
by
magic
notwithstanding
all
this
when
the
hurry
of
the
first
was
over
the
same
silence
and
constraint
prevailed
that
had
marked
their
journey
down
brownlow
did
not
join
them
at
dinner
but
remained
in
a
separate
room
the
two
other
gentlemen
hurried
in
and
out
with
anxious
faces
and
during
the
short
intervals
when
they
were
present
conversed
apart
once
maylie
was
called
away
and
after
being
absent
for
nearly
an
hour
returned
with
eyes
swollen
with
weeping
all
these
things
made
rose
and
oliver
who
were
not
in
any
new
secrets
nervous
and
uncomfortable
they
sat
wondering
in
silence
or
if
they
exchanged
a
few
words
spoke
in
whispers
as
if
they
were
afraid
to
hear
the
sound
of
their
own
voices
at
length
when
nine
had
come
and
they
began
to
think
they
were
to
hear
no
more
that
night
losberne
and
grimwig
entered
the
room
followed
by
brownlow
and
a
man
whom
oliver
almost
shrieked
with
surprise
to
see
for
they
told
him
it
was
his
brother
and
it
was
the
same
man
he
had
met
at
the
and
seen
looking
in
with
fagin
at
the
window
of
his
little
room
monks
cast
a
look
of
hate
which
even
then
he
could
not
dissemble
at
the
astonished
boy
and
sat
down
near
the
door
brownlow
who
had
papers
in
his
hand
walked
to
a
table
near
which
rose
and
oliver
were
seated
is
a
painful
task
said
he
these
declarations
which
have
been
signed
in
london
before
many
gentlemen
must
be
in
substance
repeated
here
i
would
have
spared
you
the
degradation
but
we
must
hear
them
from
your
own
lips
before
we
part
and
you
know
why
on
said
the
person
addressed
turning
away
his
face
i
have
almost
done
enough
i
think
do
keep
me
here
child
said
brownlow
drawing
oliver
to
him
and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
head
your
the
illegitimate
son
of
your
father
my
dear
friend
edwin
leeford
by
poor
young
agnes
fleming
who
died
in
giving
him
birth
said
monks
scowling
at
the
trembling
boy
the
beating
of
whose
heart
he
might
have
heard
is
the
bastard
child
term
you
use
said
brownlow
sternly
a
reproach
to
those
long
since
passed
beyond
the
feeble
censure
of
the
world
it
reflects
disgrace
on
no
one
living
except
you
who
use
it
let
that
pass
he
was
born
in
this
town
the
workhouse
of
this
town
was
the
sullen
reply
have
the
story
there
he
pointed
impatiently
to
the
papers
as
he
spoke
must
have
it
here
too
said
brownlow
looking
round
upon
the
listeners
then
you
returned
monks
father
being
taken
ill
at
rome
was
joined
by
his
wife
my
mother
from
whom
he
had
been
long
separated
who
went
from
paris
and
took
me
with
her
to
look
after
his
property
for
what
i
know
for
she
had
no
great
affection
for
him
nor
he
for
her
he
knew
nothing
of
us
for
his
senses
were
gone
and
he
slumbered
on
till
next
day
when
he
died
among
the
papers
in
his
desk
were
two
dated
on
the
night
his
illness
first
came
on
directed
to
yourself
he
addressed
himself
to
brownlow
enclosed
in
a
few
short
lines
to
you
with
an
intimation
on
the
cover
of
the
package
that
it
was
not
to
be
forwarded
till
after
he
was
dead
one
of
these
papers
was
a
letter
to
this
girl
agnes
the
other
a
will
of
the
letter
asked
brownlow
letter
a
sheet
of
paper
crossed
and
crossed
again
with
a
penitent
confession
and
prayers
to
god
to
help
her
he
had
palmed
a
tale
on
the
girl
that
some
secret
mystery
to
be
explained
one
day
prevented
his
marrying
her
just
then
and
so
she
had
gone
on
trusting
patiently
to
him
until
she
trusted
too
far
and
lost
what
none
could
ever
give
her
back
she
was
at
that
time
within
a
few
months
of
her
confinement
he
told
her
all
he
had
meant
to
do
to
hide
her
shame
if
he
had
lived
and
prayed
her
if
he
died
not
to
curse
his
memory
or
think
the
consequences
of
their
sin
would
be
visited
on
her
or
their
young
child
for
all
the
guilt
was
his
he
reminded
her
of
the
day
he
had
given
her
the
little
locket
and
the
ring
with
her
christian
name
engraved
upon
it
and
a
blank
left
for
that
which
he
hoped
one
day
to
have
bestowed
upon
her
prayed
her
yet
to
keep
it
and
wear
it
next
her
heart
as
she
had
done
before
and
then
ran
on
wildly
in
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
as
if
he
had
gone
distracted
i
believe
he
had
will
said
brownlow
as
oliver
tears
fell
fast
monks
was
silent
will
said
brownlow
speaking
for
him
in
the
same
spirit
as
the
letter
he
talked
of
miseries
which
his
wife
had
brought
upon
him
of
the
rebellious
disposition
vice
malice
and
premature
bad
passions
of
you
his
only
son
who
had
been
trained
to
hate
him
and
left
you
and
your
mother
each
an
annuity
of
eight
hundred
pounds
the
bulk
of
his
property
he
divided
into
two
equal
portions
one
for
agnes
fleming
and
the
other
for
their
child
if
it
should
be
born
alive
and
ever
come
of
age
if
it
were
a
girl
it
was
to
inherit
the
money
unconditionally
but
if
a
boy
only
on
the
stipulation
that
in
his
minority
he
should
never
have
stained
his
name
with
any
public
act
of
dishonour
meanness
cowardice
or
wrong
he
did
this
he
said
to
mark
his
confidence
in
the
other
and
his
conviction
only
strengthened
by
approaching
death
that
the
child
would
share
her
gentle
heart
and
noble
nature
if
he
were
disappointed
in
this
expectation
then
the
money
was
to
come
to
you
for
then
and
not
till
then
when
both
children
were
equal
would
he
recognise
your
prior
claim
upon
his
purse
who
had
none
upon
his
heart
but
had
from
an
infant
repulsed
him
with
coldness
and
aversion
mother
said
monks
in
a
louder
tone
what
a
woman
should
have
done
she
burnt
this
will
the
letter
never
reached
its
destination
but
that
and
other
proofs
she
kept
in
case
they
ever
tried
to
lie
away
the
blot
the
girl
father
had
the
truth
from
her
with
every
aggravation
that
her
violent
hate
i
love
her
for
it
now
could
add
goaded
by
shame
and
dishonour
he
fled
with
his
children
into
a
remote
corner
of
wales
changing
his
very
name
that
his
friends
might
never
know
of
his
retreat
and
here
no
great
while
afterwards
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
the
girl
had
left
her
home
in
secret
some
weeks
before
he
had
searched
for
her
on
foot
in
every
town
and
village
near
it
was
on
the
night
when
he
returned
home
assured
that
she
had
destroyed
herself
to
hide
her
shame
and
his
that
his
old
heart
broke
there
was
a
short
silence
here
until
brownlow
took
up
the
thread
of
the
narrative
after
this
he
said
man
edward
leeford
mother
came
to
me
he
had
left
her
when
only
eighteen
robbed
her
of
jewels
and
money
gambled
squandered
forged
and
fled
to
london
where
for
two
years
he
had
associated
with
the
lowest
outcasts
she
was
sinking
under
a
painful
and
incurable
disease
and
wished
to
recover
him
before
she
died
inquiries
were
set
on
foot
and
strict
searches
made
they
were
unavailing
for
a
long
time
but
ultimately
successful
and
he
went
back
with
her
to
france
she
died
said
monks
a
lingering
illness
and
on
her
she
bequeathed
these
secrets
to
me
together
with
her
unquenchable
and
deadly
hatred
of
all
whom
they
involved
though
she
need
not
have
left
me
that
for
i
had
inherited
it
long
before
she
would
not
believe
that
the
girl
had
destroyed
herself
and
the
child
too
but
was
filled
with
the
impression
that
a
male
child
had
been
born
and
was
alive
i
swore
to
her
if
ever
it
crossed
my
path
to
hunt
it
down
never
to
let
it
rest
to
pursue
it
with
the
bitterest
and
most
unrelenting
animosity
to
vent
upon
it
the
hatred
that
i
deeply
felt
and
to
spit
upon
the
empty
vaunt
of
that
insulting
will
by
draggin
it
if
i
could
to
the
very
she
was
right
he
came
in
my
way
at
last
i
began
well
and
but
for
babbling
drabs
i
would
have
finished
as
i
began
as
the
villain
folded
his
arms
tight
together
and
muttered
curses
on
himself
in
the
impotence
of
baffled
malice
brownlow
turned
to
the
terrified
group
beside
him
and
explained
that
the
jew
who
had
been
his
old
accomplice
and
confidant
had
a
large
reward
for
keeping
oliver
ensnared
of
which
some
part
was
to
be
given
up
in
the
event
of
his
being
rescued
and
that
a
dispute
on
this
head
had
led
to
their
visit
to
the
country
house
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
him
locket
and
ring
said
brownlow
turning
to
monks
bought
them
from
the
man
and
woman
i
told
you
of
who
stole
them
from
the
nurse
who
stole
them
from
the
corpse
answered
monks
without
raising
his
eyes
know
what
became
of
them
brownlow
merely
nodded
to
grimwig
who
disappearing
with
great
alacrity
shortly
returned
pushing
in
bumble
and
dragging
her
unwilling
consort
after
him
my
hi
deceive
me
cried
bumble
with
enthusiasm
is
that
little
oliver
oh
if
you
know
how
i
been
for
you
your
tongue
fool
murmured
bumble
natur
natur
mrs
bumble
remonstrated
the
workhouse
master
i
be
supposed
to
feel
as
brought
him
up
porochially
when
i
see
him
here
among
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
very
affablest
description
i
always
loved
that
boy
as
if
he
been
my
my
my
own
grandfather
said
bumble
halting
for
an
appropriate
comparison
oliver
my
dear
you
remember
the
blessed
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
ah
he
went
to
heaven
last
week
in
a
oak
coffin
with
plated
handles
oliver
sir
said
grimwig
tartly
your
feelings
will
do
my
endeavours
sir
replied
bumble
do
you
do
sir
i
hope
you
are
very
well
this
salutation
was
addressed
to
brownlow
who
had
stepped
up
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
respectable
couple
he
inquired
as
he
pointed
to
monks
you
know
that
person
replied
bumble
flatly
do
said
brownlow
addressing
her
spouse
never
saw
him
in
all
my
life
said
bumble
sold
him
anything
perhaps
replied
bumble
never
had
perhaps
a
certain
gold
locket
and
ring
said
brownlow
not
replied
the
matron
are
we
brought
here
to
answer
to
such
nonsense
as
this
again
brownlow
nodded
to
grimwig
and
again
that
gentleman
limped
away
with
extraordinary
readiness
but
not
again
did
he
return
with
a
stout
man
and
wife
for
this
time
he
led
in
two
palsied
women
who
shook
and
tottered
as
they
walked
shut
the
door
the
night
old
sally
died
said
the
foremost
one
raising
her
shrivelled
hand
you
could
shut
out
the
sound
nor
stop
the
chinks
no
said
the
other
looking
round
her
and
wagging
her
toothless
jaws
no
no
heard
her
try
to
tell
you
what
she
done
and
saw
you
take
a
paper
from
her
hand
and
watched
you
too
next
day
to
the
shop
said
the
first
added
the
second
it
was
a
locket
and
gold
ring
we
found
out
that
and
saw
it
given
you
we
were
by
oh
we
were
by
we
know
more
than
that
resumed
the
first
she
told
us
often
long
ago
that
the
young
mother
had
told
her
that
feeling
she
should
never
get
over
it
she
was
on
her
way
at
the
time
that
she
was
taken
ill
to
die
near
the
grave
of
the
father
of
the
child
you
like
to
see
the
pawnbroker
himself
asked
grimwig
with
a
motion
towards
the
door
replied
the
woman
he
she
pointed
to
monks
been
coward
enough
to
confess
as
i
see
he
has
and
you
have
sounded
all
these
hags
till
you
have
found
the
right
ones
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
i
sell
them
and
they
where
you
never
get
them
what
then
replied
brownlow
that
it
remains
for
us
to
take
care
that
neither
of
you
is
employed
in
a
situation
of
trust
again
you
may
leave
the
room
hope
said
bumble
looking
about
him
with
great
ruefulness
as
grimwig
disappeared
with
the
two
old
women
hope
that
this
unfortunate
little
circumstance
will
not
deprive
me
of
my
porochial
office
it
will
replied
brownlow
may
make
up
your
mind
to
that
and
think
yourself
well
off
besides
was
all
bumble
she
do
it
urged
bumble
first
looking
round
to
ascertain
that
his
partner
had
left
the
room
is
no
excuse
replied
brownlow
were
present
on
the
occasion
of
the
destruction
of
these
trinkets
and
indeed
are
the
more
guilty
of
the
two
in
the
eye
of
the
law
for
the
law
supposes
that
your
wife
acts
under
your
direction
the
law
supposes
that
said
bumble
squeezing
his
hat
emphatically
in
both
hands
law
is
a
ass
a
idiot
if
that
the
eye
of
the
law
the
law
is
a
bachelor
and
the
worst
i
wish
the
law
is
that
his
eye
may
be
opened
by
experience
by
experience
laying
great
stress
on
the
repetition
of
these
two
words
bumble
fixed
his
hat
on
very
tight
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets

to

the
few
remaining
words
we
have
to

how
they

but
if
they
have
any
reference
to
me
said
rose
let
me
hear
them
at
some
other
time
i
have
not
strength
or
spirits

the
old
gentlman

her
arm

his

fortitude
than
this
i
am
sure

you
know
this
young
lady

father
of
the
unhappy
agnes
had
daughters
said
brownlow
was
the
fate
of
the
other
the
child
child
replied
monks
her
father
died
in
a
strange
place
in
a
strange
name
without
a
letter
book
or
scrap
of
paper
that
yielded
the
faintest
clue
by
which
his
friends
or
relatives
could
be
traced
the
child
was
taken
by
some
wretched
cottagers
who
reared
it
as
their
own
on
said
brownlow
signing
to
maylie
to
approach
on
could
find
the
spot
to
which
these
people
had
repaired
said
monks
where
friendship
fails
hatred
will
often
force
a
way
my
mother
found
it
after
a
year
of
cunning
search
ay
and
found
the
child
took
it
did
she
the
people
were
poor
and
began
to
sicken
at
least
the
man
did
of
their
fine
humanity
so
she
left
it
with
them
giving
them
a
small
present
of
money
which
would
not
last
long
and
promised
more
which
she
never
meant
to
send
she
did
quite
rely
however
on
their
discontent
and
poverty
for
the
child
unhappiness
but
told
the
history
of
the
sister
shame
with
such
alterations
as
suited
her
bade
them
take
good
heed
of
the
child
for
she
came
of
bad
blood
and
told
them
she
was
illegitimate
and
sure
to
go
wrong
at
one
time
or
other
the
circumstances
countenanced
all
this
the
people
believed
it
and
there
the
child
dragged
on
an
existence
miserable
enough
even
to
satisfy
us
until
a
widow
lady
residing
then
at
chester
saw
the
girl
by
chance
pitied
her
and
took
her
home
there
was
some
cursed
spell
i
think
against
us
for
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
she
remained
there
and
was
happy
i
lost
sight
of
her
two
or
three
years
ago
and
saw
her
no
more
until
a
few
months
back
you
see
her
now
leaning
on
your
arm
not
the
less
my
niece

maylie
folding
the
fainting
girl

her
arms

would
not

fell

broken

were
exchanged
in
the
long
close
embrace
between
the
orphans
be
sacred
a
father
sister
and
mother
were
gained
and
lost
in
that
one
moment
joy
and
grief
were
mingled
in
the
cup
but
there
were
no
bitter
tears
for
even
grief
itself
arose
so
softened
and
clothed
in
such
sweet
and
tender
recollections
that
it
became
a
solemn
pleasure
and
lost
all
character
of
pain
they
were
a
long
long
time
alone
a
soft
tap
at
the
door

length

that

whatever
of
station

might
possess
at
your

and
if
you
still
adhered
to
your
former
determination
i
pledged
myself
by
no
word
or
act
to
seek
to
change
it
same
reasons
which
influenced
me
then
will
influence
me
now
said
rose
firmly
i
ever
owed
a
strict
and
rigid
duty
to
her
whose
goodness
saved
me
from
a
life
of
indigence
and
suffering
when
should
i
ever
feel
it
as
i
should
it

a
struggle

a
pang
but

the
young
lady
bursting
into

spare
myself
this

said
harry
taking
her
hand
dear

what
you

i

cried
rose
a
sense
of
his
deep
disgrace
so
worked
upon
my
own
father
that
he
shunned
all
there
we

said
enough
harry

my
love

offer
you
now
no
distinction
among
a
bustling
crowd
no
mingling
with
a
world
of
malice
and
detraction
where
the
blood
is
called
into
honest
cheeks
by
aught
but
real
disgrace
and
shame
but
a
home
a
heart
and
home
yes
dearest
rose
and
those
and
those
alone

all
i

to
offer

you

but
this
that
when
i
left
you
last
i
left
you
with
a
firm
determination
to
level
all
fancied
barriers
between
yourself
and
me
resolved
that
if
my
world
could
not
be
yours
i
would
make
yours
mine
that
no
pride
of
birth
should
curl
the
lip
at
you
for
i
would
turn
from
it
this
i
have
done
those
who
have
shrunk
from
me
because
of
this
have
shrunk
from
you
and
proved
you
so
far
right
such
power
and
patronage
such
relatives
of
influence
and
rank
as
smiled
upon
me
then
look
coldly
now
but
there
are
smiling
fields
and
waving
trees
in
england
richest
county
and
by
one
village
church
mine
rose
my
own
there
stands
a
rustic
dwelling
which
you
can
make
me
prouder
of
than
all
the
hopes
i
have
renounced
measured
a
thousandfold
this
is
my
rank
and
station
now
and
here
i
lay
it
down
a
trying
thing
waiting
supper
for
lovers
said
grimwig
waking
up
and
pulling
his
from
over
his
head
truth
to
tell
the
supper
had
been
waiting
a
most
unreasonable
time
neither
maylie
nor
harry
nor
rose
who
all
came
in
together
could
offer
a
word
in
extenuation
had
serious
thoughts
of
eating
my
head
said
grimwig
i
began
to
think
i
should
get
nothing
else
i
take
the
liberty
if
you
allow
me
of
saluting
the
bride
that
is
to
be
grimwig
lost
no
time
in
carrying
this
notice
into
effect
upon
the
blushing
girl
and
the
example
being
contagious
was
followed
both
by
the
doctor
and
brownlow
some
people
affirm
that
harry
maylie
had
been
observed
to
set
it
originally
in
a
dark
room
adjoining
but
the
best
authorities
consider
this
downright
scandal
he
being
young
and
a
clergyman
my
child
said
maylie
have
you
been
and
why
do
you
look
so
sad
there
are
tears
stealing
down
your
face
at
this
moment
what
is
the
matter
it
is
a
world
of
disappointment
often
to
the
hopes
we
most
cherish
and
hopes
that
do
our
nature
the
greatest
honour
poor
dick
was
dead
chapter
lii
fagin
last
night
alive
the
court
was
paved
from
floor
to
roof
with
human
faces
inquisitive
and
eager
eyes
peered
from
every
inch
of
space
from
the
rail
before
the
dock
away
into
the
sharpest
angle
of
the
smallest
corner
in
the
galleries
all
looks
were
fixed
upon
one
man
fagin
before
him
and
behind
above
below
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
he
seemed
to
stand
surrounded
by
a
firmament
all
bright
with
gleaming
eyes
he
stood
there
in
all
this
glare
of
living
light
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
wooden
slab
before
him
the
other
held
to
his
ear
and
his
head
thrust
forward
to
enable
him
to
catch
with
greater
distinctness
every
word
that
fell
from
the
presiding
judge
who
was
delivering
his
charge
to
the
jury
at
times
he
turned
his
eyes
sharply
upon
them
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
slightest
featherweight
in
his
favour
and
when
the
points
against
him
were
stated
with
terrible
distinctness
looked
towards
his
counsel
in
mute
appeal
that
he
would
even
then
urge
something
in
his
behalf
beyond
these
manifestations
of
anxiety
he
stirred
not
hand
or
foot
he
had
scarcely
moved
since
the
trial
began
and
now
that
the
judge
ceased
to
speak
he
still
remained
in
the
same
strained
attitude
of
close
attention
with
his
gaze
bent
on
him
as
though
he
listened
still
a
slight
bustle
in
the
court
recalled
him
to
himself
looking
round
he
saw
that
the
juryman
had
turned
together
to
consider
their
verdict
as
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
gallery
he
could
see
the
people
rising
above
each
other
to
see
his
face
some
hastily
applying
their
glasses
to
their
eyes
and
others
whispering
their
neighbours
with
looks
expressive
of
abhorrence
a
few
there
were
who
seemed
unmindful
of
him
and
looked
only
to
the
jury
in
impatient
wonder
how
they
could
delay
but
in
no
one
face
not
even
among
the
women
of
whom
there
were
many
there
could
he
read
the
faintest
sympathy
with
himself
or
any
feeling
but
one
of
interest
that
he
should
be
condemned
as
he
saw
all
this
in
one
bewildered
glance
the
deathlike
stillness
came
again
and
looking
back
he
saw
that
the
jurymen
had
turned
towards
the
judge
hush
they
only
sought
permission
to
retire
he
looked
wistfully
into
their
faces
one
by
one
when
they
passed
out
as
though
to
see
which
way
the
greater
number
leant
but
that
was
fruitless
the
jailer
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
followed
mechanically
to
the
end
of
the
dock
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
the
man
pointed
it
out
or
he
would
not
have
seen
it
he
looked
up
into
the
gallery
again
some
of
the
people
were
eating
and
some
fanning
themselves
with
handkerchiefs
for
the
crowded
place
was
very
hot
there
was
one
young
man
sketching
his
face
in
a
little
he
wondered
whether
it
was
like
and
looked
on
when
the
artist
broke
his
and
made
another
with
his
knife
as
any
idle
spectator
might
have
done
in
the
same
way
when
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
judge
his
mind
began
to
busy
itself
with
the
fashion
of
his
dress
and
what
it
cost
and
how
he
put
it
on
there
was
an
old
fat
gentleman
on
the
bench
too
who
had
gone
out
some
half
an
hour
before
and
now
come
back
he
wondered
within
himself
whether
this
man
had
been
to
get
his
dinner
what
he
had
had
and
where
he
had
had
it
and
pursued
this
train
of
careless
thought
until
some
new
object
caught
his
eye
and
roused
another
not
that
all
this
time
his
mind
was
for
an
instant
free
from
one
oppressive
overwhelming
sense
of
the
grave
that
opened
at
his
feet
it
was
ever
present
to
him
but
in
a
vague
and
general
way
and
he
could
not
fix
his
thoughts
upon
it
thus
even
while
he
trembled
and
turned
burning
hot
at
the
idea
of
speedy
death
he
fell
to
counting
the
iron
spikes
before
him
and
wondering
how
the
head
of
one
had
been
broken
off
and
whether
they
would
mend
it
or
leave
it
as
it
was
then
he
thought
of
all
the
horrors
of
the
gallows
and
the
scaffold
and
stopped
to
watch
a
man
sprinkling
the
floor
to
cool
it
and
then
went
on
to
think
again
at
length
there
was
a
cry
of
silence
and
a
breathless
look
from
all
towards
the
door
the
jury
returned
and
passed
him
close
he
could
glean
nothing
from
their
faces
they
might
as
well
have
been
of
stone
perfect
stillness
ensued
not
a
rustle
not
a
breath
guilty
the
building
rang
with
a
tremendous
shout
and
another
and
another
and
then
it
echoed
loud
groans
that
gathered
strength
as
they
swelled
out
like
angry
thunder
it
was
a
peal
of
joy
from
the
populace
outside
greeting
the
news
that
he
would
die
on
monday
the
noise
subsided
and
he
was
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say
why
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
passed
upon
him
he
had
resumed
his
listening
attitude
and
looked
intently
at
his
questioner
while
the
demand
was
made
but
it
was
twice
repeated
before
he
seemed
to
hear
it
and
then
he
only
muttered
that
he
was
an
old
man
an
old
man
and
so
dropping
into
a
whisper
was
silent
again
the
judge
assumed
the
black
cap
and
the
prisoner
still
stood
with
the
same
air
and
gesture
a
woman
in
the
gallery
uttered
some
exclamation
called
forth
by
this
dread
solemnity
he
looked
hastily
up
as
if
angry
at
the
interruption
and
bent
forward
yet
more
attentively
the
address
was
solemn
and
impressive
the
sentence
fearful
to
hear
but
he
stood
like
a
marble
figure
without
the
motion
of
a
nerve
his
haggard
face
was
still
thrust
forward
his
hanging
down
and
his
eyes
staring
out
before
him
when
the
jailer
put
his
hand
upon
his
arm
and
beckoned
him
away
he
gazed
stupidly
about
him
for
an
instant
and
obeyed
they
led
him
through
a
paved
room
under
the
court
where
some
prisoners
were
waiting
till
their
turns
came
and
others
were
talking
to
their
friends
who
crowded
round
a
grate
which
looked
into
the
open
yard
there
was
nobody
there
to
speak
to
but
as
he
passed
the
prisoners
fell
back
to
render
him
more
visible
to
the
people
who
were
clinging
to
the
bars
and
they
assailed
him
with
opprobrious
names
and
screeched
and
hissed
he
shook
his
fist
and
would
have
spat
upon
them
but
his
conductors
hurried
him
on
through
a
gloomy
passage
lighted
by
a
few
dim
lamps
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
here
he
was
searched
that
he
might
not
have
about
him
the
means
of
anticipating
the
law
this
ceremony
performed
they
led
him
to
one
of
the
condemned
cells
and
left
him
there
alone
he
sat
down
on
a
stone
bench
opposite
the
door
which
served
for
seat
and
bedstead
and
casting
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
after
awhile
he
began
to
remember
a
few
disjointed
fragments
of
what
the
judge
had
said
though
it
had
seemed
to
him
at
the
time
that
he
could
not
hear
a
word
these
gradually
fell
into
their
proper
places
and
by
degrees
suggested
more
so
that
in
a
little
time
he
had
the
whole
almost
as
it
was
delivered
to
be
hanged
by
the
neck
till
he
was
dead
that
was
the
end
to
be
hanged
by
the
neck
till
he
was
dead
as
it
came
on
very
dark
he
began
to
think
of
all
the
men
he
had
known
who
had
died
upon
the
scaffold
some
of
them
through
his
means
they
rose
up
in
such
quick
succession
that
he
could
hardly
count
them
he
had
seen
some
of
them
die
and
had
joked
too
because
they
died
with
prayers
upon
their
lips
with
what
a
rattling
noise
the
drop
went
down
and
how
suddenly
they
changed
from
strong
and
vigorous
men
to
dangling
heaps
of
clothes
some
of
them
might
have
inhabited
that
very
cell
sat
upon
that
very
spot
it
was
very
dark
why
did
they
bring
a
light
the
cell
had
been
built
for
many
years
scores
of
men
must
have
passed
their
last
hours
there
it
was
like
sitting
in
a
vault
strewn
with
dead
bodies
the
cap
the
noose
the
pinioned
arms
the
faces
that
he
knew
even
beneath
that
hideous
light
light
at
length
when
his
hands
were
raw
with
beating
against
the
heavy
door
and
walls
two
men
appeared
one
bearing
a
candle
which
he
thrust
into
an
iron
candlestick
fixed
against
the
wall
the
other
dragging
in
a
mattress
on
which
to
pass
the
night
for
the
prisoner
was
to
be
left
alone
no
more
then
came
the
night
dark
dismal
silent
night
other
watchers
are
glad
to
hear
this
strike
for
they
tell
of
life
and
coming
day
to
him
they
brought
despair
the
boom
of
every
iron
bell
came
laden
with
the
one
deep
hollow
sound
death
what
availed
the
noise
and
bustle
of
cheerful
morning
which
penetrated
even
there
to
him
it
was
another
form
of
knell
with
mockery
added
to
the
warning
the
day
passed
off
day
there
was
no
day
it
was
gone
as
soon
as
come
and
night
came
on
again
night
so
long
and
yet
so
short
long
in
its
dreadful
silence
and
short
in
its
fleeting
hours
at
one
time
he
raved
and
blasphemed
and
at
another
howled
and
tore
his
hair
venerable
men
of
his
own
persuasion
had
come
to
pray
beside
him
but
he
had
driven
them
away
with
curses
they
renewed
their
charitable
efforts
and
he
beat
them
off
saturday
night
he
had
only
one
night
more
to
live
and
as
he
thought
of
this
the
day
broke
sunday
it
was
not
until
the
night
of
this
last
awful
day
that
a
withering
sense
of
his
helpless
desperate
state
came
in
its
full
intensity
upon
his
blighted
soul
not
that
he
had
ever
held
any
defined
or
positive
hope
of
mercy
but
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
consider
more
than
the
dim
probability
of
dying
so
soon
he
had
spoken
little
to
either
of
the
two
men
who
relieved
each
other
in
their
attendance
upon
him
and
they
for
their
parts
made
no
effort
to
rouse
his
attention
he
had
sat
there
awake
but
dreaming
now
he
started
up
every
minute
and
with
gasping
mouth
and
burning
skin
hurried
to
and
fro
in
such
a
paroxysm
of
fear
and
wrath
that
even
they
used
to
such
sights
recoiled
from
him
with
horror
he
grew
so
terrible
at
last
in
all
the
tortures
of
his
evil
conscience
that
one
man
could
not
bear
to
sit
there
eyeing
him
alone
and
so
the
two
kept
watch
together
he
cowered
down
upon
his
stone
bed
and
thought
of
the
past
he
had
been
wounded
with
some
missiles
from
the
crowd
on
the
day
of
his
capture
and
his
head
was
bandaged
with
a
linen
cloth
his
red
hair
hung
down
upon
his
bloodless
face
his
beard
was
torn
and
twisted
into
knots
his
eyes
shone
with
a
terrible
light
his
unwashed
flesh
crackled
with
the
fever
that
burnt
him
up
eight
nine
then
if
it
was
not
a
trick
to
frighten
him
and
those
were
the
real
hours
treading
on
each
other
heels
where
would
he
be
when
they
came
round
again
eleven
another
struck
before
the
voice
of
the
previous
hour
had
ceased
to
vibrate
at
eight
he
would
be
the
only
mourner
in
his
own
funeral
train
at
eleven
those
dreadful
walls
of
newgate
which
have
hidden
so
much
misery
and
such
unspeakable
anguish
not
only
from
the
eyes
but
too
often
and
too
long
from
the
thoughts
of
men
never
held
so
dread
a
spectacle
as
that
the
few
who
lingered
as
they
passed
and
wondered
what
the
man
was
doing
who
was
to
be
hanged
would
have
slept
but
ill
that
night
if
they
could
have
seen
him
from
early
in
the
evening
until
nearly
midnight
little
groups
of
two
and
three
presented
themselves
at
the
and
inquired
with
anxious
faces
whether
any
reprieve
had
been
received
these
being
answered
in
the
negative
communicated
the
welcome
intelligence
to
clusters
in
the
street
who
pointed
out
to
one
another
the
door
from
which
he
must
come
out
and
showed
where
the
scaffold
would
be
built
and
walking
with
unwilling
steps
away
turned
back
to
conjure
up
the
scene
by
degrees
they
fell
off
one
by
one
and
for
an
hour
in
the
dead
of
night
the
street
was
left
to
solitude
and
darkness
the
space
before
the
prison
was
cleared
and
a
few
strong
barriers
painted
black
had
been
already
thrown
across
the
road
to
break
the
pressure
of
the
expected
crowd
when
brownlow
and
oliver
appeared
at
the
wicket
and
presented
an
order
of
admission
to
the
prisoner
signed
by
one
of
the
sheriffs
they
were
immediately
admitted
into
the
lodge
the
young
gentleman
to
come
too
sir
said
the
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
conduct
them
not
a
sight
for
children
sir
is
not
indeed
my
friend
rejoined
brownlow
my
business
with
this
man
is
intimately
connected
with
him
and
as
this
child
has
seen
him
in
the
full
career
of
his
success
and
villainy
i
think
it
as
well
even
at
the
cost
of
some
pain
and
fear
that
he
should
see
him
now
these
few
words
had
been
said
apart
so
as
to
be
inaudible
to
oliver
the
man
touched
his
hat
and
glancing
at
oliver
with
some
curiousity
opened
another
gate
opposite
to
that
by
which
they
had
entered
and
led
them
on
through
dark
and
winding
ways
towards
the
cells
said
the
man
stopping
in
a
gloomy
passage
where
a
couple
of
workmen
were
making
some
preparations
in
profound
silence
is
the
place
he
passes
through
if
you
step
this
way
you
can
see
the
door
he
goes
out
at
he
led
them
into
a
stone
kitchen
fitted
with
coppers
for
dressing
the
prison
food
and
pointed
to
a
door
there
was
an
open
grating
above
it
through
which
came
the
sound
of
men
voices
mingled
with
the
noise
of
hammering
and
the
throwing
down
of
boards
they
were
putting
up
the
scaffold
from
this
place
they
passed
through
several
strong
gates
opened
by
other
turnkeys
from
the
inner
side
and
having
entered
an
open
yard
ascended
a
flight
of
narrow
steps
and
came
into
a
passage
with
a
row
of
strong
doors
on
the
left
hand
motioning
them
to
remain
where
they
were
the
turnkey
knocked
at
one
of
these
with
his
bunch
of
keys
the
two
attendants
after
a
little
whispering
came
out
into
the
passage
stretching
themselves
as
if
glad
of
the
temporary
relief
and
motioned
the
visitors
to
follow
the
jailer
into
the
cell
they
did
so
the
condemned
criminal
was
seated
on
his
bed
rocking
himself
from
side
to
side
with
a
countenance
more
like
that
of
a
snared
beast
than
the
face
of
a
man
his
mind
was
evidently
wandering
to
his
old
life
for
he
continued
to
mutter
without
appearing
conscious
of
their
presence
otherwise
than
as
a
part
of
his
vision
boy
charley
well
done
he
mumbled
too
ha
ha
ha
oliver
too
quite
the
gentleman
now
quite
the
take
that
boy
away
to
bed
the
jailer
took
the
disengaged
hand
of
oliver
and
whispering
him
not
to
be
alarmed
looked
on
without
speaking
him
away
to
bed
cried
fagin
you
hear
me
some
of
you
he
has
been
the
the
somehow

the
girl

as
deep
as

can
cut
saw
his
head

said
the
jailer
me
cried
the
jew
falling
instantly
into
the
attitude
of
listening
he
had
assumed
upon
his
trial
old
man
my
lord
a
very
old
old
man
said
the
turnkey
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
to
keep
him
down

to
see
you
to
ask
you
some
questions
i
suppose
fagin
fagin
are
you
a
man
sha
be
one
long
he
replied
looking
up
with
a
face
retaining
no
human
expression
but
rage
and
terror
them
all
dead
what
right
have
they
to
butcher
me
as
he
spoke
he
caught
sight
of
oliver
and
brownlow
shrinking
to
the
furthest
corner
of
the
seat
he
demanded
to
know
what
they
wanted
there
said
the
turnkey
still
holding
him
down
sir

him
what
you
want
quick
if
you
please
for
he
grows
worse
as
the
time

on

brownlow
advancing
were
placed
in
your
hands
for
better
security
by
a
man
called
monks
all
a
lie
together
replied
fagin
have
one

love

brownlow
solemnly

upon
the
very
verge
of
death
but

fagin
beckoning
to
him
here
let
me
whisper
to
you

not
afraid
said
oliver
in
a
low
voice
as
he
relinquished
brownlow
hand
papers
said
fagin
drawing
oliver
towards
him
in
a
canvas
bag
in
a
hole
a
little
way
up
the
chimney
in
the
top
i

upon
your
knees

replied
fagin
pushing
the
boy
before
him
towards
the
door
and
looking
vacantly
over
his
head
i
gone
to
sleep
they
believe
you
you
can
get
me
out
if
you
take
me
so
now
then

wretched

cried
the
boy
with
a
burst
of
tears

said
fagin

on
this
door
first
if

shake
and
tremble
as

the
gallows

you
mind
but
hurry
on
now
now
now

else
to
ask
him
sir
inquired
the
turnkey
other
question
replied
brownlow
i
hoped
we
could
recall
him
to
a
sense
of
his
position
will
do
that
sir
replied
the
man
shaking
his
head
had
better
leave
him
the
door
of
the
cell
opened
and
the
attendants
returned
on
press
on
cried
fagin
but
not
so
slow
faster
faster
the
men
laid
hands
upon
him
and
disengaging
oliver
from
his
grasp
held
him
back
he
struggled
with
the
power
of
desperation
for
an
instant
and
then
sent
up
cry
upon
cry
that
penetrated
even
those
massive
walls
and
rang
in
their
ears
until
they
reached
the
open
yard
it
was
some
time
before
they
left
the
prison
oliver
nearly
swooned
after
this
frightful
scene
and
was
so
weak
that
for
an
hour
or
more
he
had
not
the
strength
to
walk
day
was
dawning
when
they
again
emerged
a
great
multitude
had
already
assembled
the
windows
were
filled
with
people
smoking
and
playing
cards
to
beguile
the
time
the
crowd
were
pushing
quarrelling
joking
everything
told
of
life
and
animation
but
one
dark
cluster
of
objects
in
the
centre
of
all
the
black
stage
the
the
rope
and
all
the
hideous
apparatus
of
death
chapter
liii
and
last
the
fortunes
of
those
who
have
figured
in
this
tale
are
nearly
closed
the
little
that
remains
to
their
historian
to
relate
is
told
in
few
and
simple
words
before
three
months
had
passed
rose
fleming
and
harry
maylie
were
married
in
the
village
church
which
was
henceforth
to
be
the
scene
of
the
young
clergyman
labours
on
the
same
day
they
entered
into
possession
of
their
new
and
happy
home
maylie
took
up
her
abode
with
her
son
and
to
enjoy
during
the
tranquil
remainder
of
her
days
the
greatest
felicity
that
age
and
worth
can
know
the
contemplation
of
the
happiness
of
those
on
whom
the
warmest
affections
and
tenderest
cares
of
a
life
have
been
unceasingly
bestowed
it
appeared
on
full
and
careful
investigation
that
if
the
wreck
of
property
remaining
in
the
custody
of
monks
which
had
never
prospered
either
in
his
hands
or
in
those
of
his
mother
were
equally
divided
between
himself
and
oliver
it
would
yield
to
each
little
more
than
three
thousand
pounds
by
the
provisions
of
his
father
will
oliver
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
whole
but
brownlow
unwilling
to
deprive
the
elder
son
of
the
opportunity
of
retrieving
his
former
vices
and
pursuing
an
honest
career
proposed
this
mode
of
distribution
to
which
his
young
charge
joyfully
acceded
monks
still
bearing
that
assumed
name
retired
with
his
portion
to
a
distant
part
of
the
new
world
where
having
quickly
squandered
it
he
once
more
fell
into
his
old
courses
and
after
undergoing
a
long
confinement
for
some
fresh
act
of
fraud
and
knavery
at
length
sunk
under
an
attack
of
his
old
disorder
and
died
in
prison
as
far
from
home
died
the
chief
remaining
members
of
his
friend
fagin
gang
brownlow
adopted
oliver
as
his
son
removing
with
him
and
the
old
housekeeper
to
within
a
mile
of
the
where
his
dear
friends
resided
he
gratified
the
only
remaining
wish
of
oliver
warm
and
earnest
heart
and
thus
linked
together
a
little
society
whose
condition
approached
as
nearly
to
one
of
perfect
happiness
as
can
ever
be
known
in
this
changing
world
soon
after
the
marriage
of
the
young
people
the
worthy
doctor
returned
to
chertsey
where
bereft
of
the
presence
of
his
old
friends
he
would
have
been
discontented
if
his
temperament
had
admitted
of
such
a
feeling
and
would
have
turned
quite
peevish
if
he
had
known
how
for
two
or
three
months
he
contented
himself
with
hinting
that
he
feared
the
air
began
to
disagree
with
him
then
finding
that
the
place
really
no
longer
was
to
him
what
it
had
been
he
settled
his
business
on
his
assistant
took
a
bachelor
cottage
outside
the
village
of
which
his
young
friend
was
pastor
and
instantaneously
recovered
here
he
took
to
gardening
planting
fishing
carpentering
and
various
other
pursuits
of
a
similar
kind
all
undertaken
with
his
characteristic
impetuosity
in
each
and
all
he
has
since
become
famous
throughout
the
neighborhood
as
a
most
profound
authority
before
his
removal
he
had
managed
to
contract
a
strong
friendship
for
grimwig
which
that
eccentric
gentleman
cordially
reciprocated
he
is
accordingly
visited
by
grimwig
a
great
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
year
on
all
such
occasions
grimwig
plants
fishes
and
carpenters
with
great
ardour
doing
everything
in
a
very
singular
and
unprecedented
manner
but
always
maintaining
with
his
favourite
asseveration
that
his
mode
is
the
right
one
on
sundays
he
never
fails
to
criticise
the
sermon
to
the
young
clergyman
face
always
informing
losberne
in
strict
confidence
afterwards
that
he
considers
it
an
excellent
performance
but
deems
it
as
well
not
to
say
so
it
is
a
standing
and
very
favourite
joke
for
brownlow
to
rally
him
on
his
old
prophecy
concerning
oliver
and
to
remind
him
of
the
night
on
which
they
sat
with
the
watch
between
them
waiting
his
return
but
grimwig
contends
that
he
was
right
in
the
main
and
in
proof
thereof
remarks
that
oliver
did
not
come
back
after
all
which
always
calls
forth
a
laugh
on
his
side
and
increases
his
good
humour

informer
in
which
calling
he
realises
a
genteel
subsistence
his
plan
is
to
walk
out
once
a
week
during
church
time
attended
by
charlotte
in
respectable
attire
the
lady
faints
away
at
the
doors
of
charitable
publicans
and
the
gentleman
being
accommodated
with
worth
of
brandy
to
restore
her
lays
an
information
next
day
and
pockets
half
the
penalty
sometimes
claypole
faints
himself
but
the
result
is
the
same
and
bumble
deprived
of
their
situations
were
gradually
reduced
to
great
indigence
and
misery
and
finally
became
paupers
in
that
very
same
workhouse
in
which
they
had
once
lorded
it
over
others
bumble
has
been
heard
to
say
that
in
this
reverse
and
degradation
he
has
not
even
spirits
to
be
thankful
for
being
separated
from
his
wife
as
to
giles
and
brittles
they
still
remain
in
their
old
posts
although
the
former
is
bald
and
the
boy
quite
grey
they
sleep
at
the
parsonage
but
divide
their
attentions
so
equally
among
its
inmates
and
oliver
and
brownlow
and
losberne
that
to
this
day
the
villagers
have
never
been
able
to
discover
to
which
establishment
they
properly
belong
master
charles
bates
appalled
by
sikes
crime
fell
into
a
train
of
reflection
whether
an
honest
life
was
not
after
all
the
best
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
it
certainly
was
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
scenes
of
the
past
resolved
to
amend
it
in
some
new
sphere
of
action
he
struggled
hard
and
suffered
much
for
some
time
but
having
a
contented
disposition
and
a
good
purpose
succeeded
in
the
end
and
from
being
a
farmer
drudge
and
a
carrier
lad
he
is
now
the
merriest
young
grazier
in
all
northamptonshire
and
now
the
hand
that
traces
these
words
falters
as
it
approaches
the
conclusion
of
its
task
and
would
weave
for
a
little
longer
space
the
thread
of
these
adventures
i
would
fain
linger
yet
with
a
few
of
those
among
whom
i
have
so
long
moved
and
share
their
happiness
by
endeavouring
to
depict
it
i
would
show
rose
maylie
in
all
the
bloom
and
grace
of
early
womanhood
shedding
on
her
secluded
path
in
life
soft
and
gentle
light
that
fell
on
all
who
trod
it
with
her
and
shone
into
their
hearts
i
would
paint
her
the
life
and
joy
of
the
circle
and
the
lively
summer
group
i
would
follow
her
through
the
sultry
fields
at
noon
and
hear
the
low
tones
of
her
sweet
voice
in
the
moonlit
evening
walk
i
would
watch
her
in
all
her
goodness
and
charity
abroad
and
the
smiling
untiring
discharge
of
domestic
duties
at
home
i
would
paint
her
and
her
dead
sister
child
happy
in
their
love
for
one
another
and
passing
whole
hours
together
in
picturing
the
friends
whom
they
had
so
sadly
lost
i
would
summon
before
me
once
again
those
joyous
little
faces
that
clustered
round
her
knee
and
listen
to
their
merry
prattle
i
would
recall
the
tones
of
that
clear
laugh
and
conjure
up
the
sympathising
tear
that
glistened
in
the
soft
blue
eye
these
and
a
thousand
looks
and
smiles
and
turns
of
thought
and
speech
i
would
fain
recall
them
every
one
how
brownlow
went
on
from
day
to
day
filling
the
mind
of
his
adopted
child
with
stores
of
knowledge
and
becoming
attached
to
him
more
and
more
as
his
nature
developed
itself
and
showed
the
thriving
seeds
of
all
he
wished
him
to
become
how
he
traced
in
him
new
traits
of
his
early
friend
that
awakened
in
his
own
bosom
old
remembrances
melancholy
and
yet
sweet
and
soothing
how
the
two
orphans
tried
by
adversity
remembered
its
lessons
in
mercy
to
others
and
mutual
love
and
fervent
thanks
to
him
who
had
protected
and
preserved
them
these
are
all
matters
which
need
not
to
be
told
i
have
said
that
they
were
truly
happy
and
without
strong
affection
and
humanity
of
heart
and
gratitude
to
that
being
whose
code
is
mercy
and
whose
great
attribute
is
benevolence
to
all
things
that
breathe
happiness
can
never
be
attained
within
the
altar
of
the
old
village
church
there
stands
a
white
marble
tablet
which
bears
as
yet
but
one
word
there
is
no
coffin
in
that
tomb
and
may
it
be
many
many
years
before
another
name
is
placed
above
it
but
if
the
spirits
of
the
dead
ever
come
back
to
earth
to
visit
spots
hallowed
by
the
love
the
love
beyond
the
grave
of
those
whom
they
knew
in
life
i
believe
that
the
shade
of
agnes
sometimes
hovers
round
that
solemn
nook
i
believe
it
none
the
less
because
that
nook
is
in
a
church
and
she
was
weak
and
erring
