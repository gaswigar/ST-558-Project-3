mine
to
children

observes
this
volume
in

and
trembles
for
the
darling
nerves
must
please
to
clearly
understand
if
baby
suffers
the
artist
is
to
blame
not
but
should
the
little
brat
survive
and
fatten
on
the
ruthless
rhyme
to
raise
a
heartless
home
and
thrive
through
a
successful
life
of

bluebeard
yes
i
am
bluebeard
and
my
name
is
one
that
children
can
not
stand
yet
once
i
used
to
be
so
tame
i
eat
out
of
a
person
hand
so
gentle
was
i
wont
to
be
a
curate
might
have
played
with
me
people
accord
me
little
praise
yet
i
am
not
the
least
alarming
i
can
recall
in
bygone
days
a
maid
once
said
she
thought
me
charming
she
was
my
friend
no
more
i
vow
and
she
in
an
asylum
now
girls
used
to
clamour
for
my
hand
girls
i
refused
in
simple
dozens
i
said
i
be
their
brother
and
they
promised
they
would
be
my
cousins
one
i
accepted
more
or
less
but
i
forgotten
her
address
they
worried
me
like
anything
by
their
proposals
day
until
at
last
i
had
to
ring
the
bell
and
have
them
cleared
away
i
often
pondered
on
the
cost
of
getting
them
completely
lost
to
share
my
somewhat
lofty
rank
was
what
they
panted
for
like
mad
you
see
my
balance
at
the
bank
was
not
so
small
and
i
may
add
a
castle
gothic
and
immense
is
my
official
residence
it
overlooks
a
many
a
mile
of
park
of
gardens
and
domains
i
staying
now
in
lodgings
while
they
doing
up
the
well
the
drains
for
they
began
to
give
offence
at
my
official
residence
and
when
i
entertain
at
home
i
hardly
ever
fail
to
please
the
upper
tens
alone
may
come
to
join
in
my
recherché
teas
i
am
a
king
in
sense
at
my
official
residence
my
dances
on
a
parquet
floor
my
royal
dinners
which
consist
of
fifteen
courses
sometimes
more
are
things
that
are
not
lightly
missed
in
fact
i
do
not
spare
expense
at
my
official
residence
my
hospitality
to
those
whom
i
invite
to
come
and
stay
is
famed
my
wine
like
water
flows
exactly
like
some
people
say
but
this
is
mere
impertinence
at
my
official
residence
when
through
the
streets
i
walk
about
my
subjects
stand
and
kiss
their
hands
raise
a
refined
metallic
shout
wave
flags
and
warble
tunes
on
bands
while
bunting
hangs
on
front
with
my
commands
to
let
it
bunt
when
i
come
home
again
of
course
retainers
are
employed
to
cheer
my
paid
domestics
get
quite
hoarse
acclaiming
me
and
you
can
hear
the
welkin
ringing
to
the
sky
aye
aye
and
let
it
welk
say
i
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
there
are
some
persons
who
at
times
because
i
am
so
popular
accuse
me
of
most
awful
crimes
a
girl
once
said
i
was
a
flirt
oh
my
how
the
expression
hurt
i
flirted
in
the
least
never
for
very
long
i
mean
ask
any
lady
now
deceased
who
partner
of
my
life
has
been
oh
well
of
course
sometimes
perhaps
i
meet
a
girl
like
other
chaps
and
if
i
like
her
very
much
and
if
she
cares
for
me
a
bit
where
is
the
harm
of
look
or
touch
if
neither
of
us
mentions
it
it
is
right
i
do
suppose
but
no
one
hurt
if
no
one
knows
and
if
i
placed
my
hand
below
her
chin
and
raised
her
face
an
inch
and
then
proceeded
well
you
know
excuse
the
vulgarism
to
clinch
it
would
be
wrong
without
a
doubt
that
is
if
anyone
found
out
but
then
remember
life
is
short
and
woman
arts
are
very
long
and
sometimes
when
one
did
ought
one
knowingly
commits
a
wrong
well
speaking
for
myself
of
course
i
almost
always
feel
remorse
one
should
not
break
one
self
fast
of
little
habits
of
this
sort
which
may
be
definitely
classed
with
gambling
or
a
taste
for
port
they
should
be
dropped
until
the
heart
is
subject
to
the
will
i
knew
a
man
on
seventh
street
who
at
a
very
slight
expense
by
persevering
was
ly
cured
of
total
abstinence
an
altered
life
he
has
begun
and
takes
a
horn
with
anyone
i
knew
another
man
whose
wife
was
an
suicide
she
daily
strove
to
take
her
life
and
naturally
nearly
died
but
some
such
system
she
essayed
and
now
she
eighty
in
the
shade
ah
the
new
leaves
i
try
to
turn
but
like
so
many
men
in
town
i
seem
as
with
regret
i
learn
merely
to
turn
the
corner
down
a
habit
which
i
fear
alack
makes
it
more
easy
to
turn
back
i
have
been
criticised
a
lot
i
venture
to
enquire
what
for
because
forsooth
i
have
not
got
the
instincts
of
a
bachelor
just
hear
my
story
you
will
find
how
grossly
i
have
been
maligned
i
was
unlucky
with
my
wives
so
are
the
most
of
married
men
undoubtedly
they
lost
their
lives
of
course
but
even
so
what
then
i
loved
them
dearly
understand
and
i
love
to
beat
the
band
my
first
was
little
emmeline
more
beautiful
than
day
was
she
her
proud
aristocratic
mien
was
what
at
once
attracted
me
i
naturally
did
not
know
that
i
should
soon
dislike
her
so
but
there
it
was
and
you
infer
i
had
not
very
long
to
wait
before
my
love
for
her
turned
to
unutterable
hate
so
when
this
state
of
things
i
found
i
naturally
had
her
drowned
my
next
was
sarah
sweet
but
shy
and
quite
inordinately
meek
yes
even
now
i
wonder
why
i
had
her
hanged
within
the
week
perhaps
i
felt
a
bit
upset
or
else
she
bored
me
i
forget
then
came
evangeline
my
third
and
when
i
chanced
to
be
away
she
so
i
subsequently
heard
was
wont
i
deeply
grieve
to
say
with
my
small
retinue
to
flirt
i
strangled
her
i
hope
it
hurt
isabel
was
i
think
my
next
that
is
if
i
remember
right
and
i
was
really
very
vexed
to
find
her
hair
come
off
at
night
to
falsehood
i
could
not
connive
and
so
i
had
her
boiled
alive
then
came
sophia
i
believe
her
coiffure
was
at
least
her
own
alas
she
fancied
to
deceive
her
friends
by
altering
its
tone
she
dyed
her
locks
a
flaming
red
i
suffocated
her
in
bed
susannah
maud
was
number
six
but
she
did
not
survive
a
day
poor
sue
she
had
no
parlour
tricks
and
hardly
anything
to
say
a
little
strychnine
in
her
tea
finished
her
off
and
i
was
free
yet
i
did
not
despair
and
soon
in
spite
of
failures
started
off
upon
my
seventh
honeymoon
with
jane
but
could
not
stand
her
cough
was
chronic
kindness
was
in
vain
i
pushed
her
underneath
the
train
well
after
her
i
married
kate
a
most
unpleasant
woman
oh
i
caught
her
at
the
garden
gate
kissing
a
man
i
did
know
and
as
that
did
suit
me
quite
i
blew
her
up
with
dynamite
most
married
men
so
sorely
tried
as
this
would
have
been
rather
bored
not
i
but
chose
another
bride
and
married
ruth
alas
she
snored
i
served
her
just
the
same
as
kate
and
so
she
joined
the
other
eight
my
last
was
grace
i
am
not
clear
i
she
did
like
me
much
she
used
to
scream
when
i
came
near
and
shuddered
at
my
lightest
touch
she
seemed
to
wish
to
keep
aloof
and
so
i
threw
her
off
the
roof
this
is
the
point
i
wish
to
make
from
all
the
wives
for
whom
i
grieve
whose
lives
i
had
perforce
to
take
not
one
complaint
did
i
receive
and
no
expense
was
spared
to
please
my
spouses
at
their
obsequies
my
habits
i
would
have
you
know
are
perfect
as
they
always
been
you
ask
if
i
am
good
and
go
to
church
and
keep
my
fingers
clean
i
do
i
mean
to
say
i
am
i
have
the
morals
of
a
lamb
in
my
domains
there
is
no
sin
virtue
is
rampant
all
the
time
since
i
so
thoughtfully
brought
in
a
bill
which
legalizes
crime
committing
things
that
are
not
wrong
must
pall
before
so
very
long
and
if
what
you
imagine
vice
is
not
considered
so
at
all
crime
does
seem
the
least
bit
nice
there
no
temptation
then
to
fall
for
half
the
charm
of
things
we
do
is
knowing
that
we
ought
to
believe
me
then
i
am
not
bad
though
in
my
youth
i
had
to
trek
because
i
happened
to
have
had
some
difficulties
with
a
cheque
what
forgery
in
some
might
be
is
absentmindedness
in
me
i
know
that
i
was
much
abused
no
doubt
when
i
was
young
and
rash
but
i
should
not
have
been
accused
of
misappropriating
cash
i
may
have
sneaked
