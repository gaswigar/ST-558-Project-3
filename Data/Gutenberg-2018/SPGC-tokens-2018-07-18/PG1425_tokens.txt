the
clock
of
the
little
town
of
menda
had
just
struck
midnight
at
that
moment
a
young
french
officer
leaning
on
the
parapet
of
a
long
terrace
which
bordered
the
gardens
of
the
chateau
de
menda
seemed
buried
in
thoughts
that
were
deeper
than
comported
with
the
carelessness
of
military
life
though
it
must
be
said
that
never
were
hour
scene
or
night
more
propitious
for
meditation
the
beautiful
sky
of
spain
spread
its
dome
of
azure
above
his
head
the
scintillation
of
the
stars
and
the
soft
light
of
the
moon
illumined
the
delightful
valley
that
lay
at
his
feet
resting
partly
against
an
in
bloom
the
young
major
could
see
three
hundred
feet
below
him
the
town
of
menda
at
the
base
of
the
rock
on
which
the
castle
is
built
turning
his
head
he
looked
down
upon
the
sea
the
sparkling
waters
of
which
encircled
the
landscape
with
a
sheet
of
silver
the
chateau
was
illuminated
the
joyous
uproar
of
a
ball
the
sounds
of
an
orchestra
the
laughter
of
the
dancers
came
to
him
mingling
with
the
distant
murmur
of
the
waves
the
coolness
of
the
night
gave
fresh
energy
to
his
body
that
was
tired
with
the
heat
of
the
day
besides
which
the
gardens
were
planted
with
trees
so
balmy
and
flowers
so
sweet
that
the
young
man
felt
as
if
plunged
in
a
perfumed
bath
the
chateau
de
menda
belonged
to
a
grandee
of
spain
who
was
at
this
time
living
there
with
his
family
during
the
whole
evening
the
eldest
daughter
had
looked
at
the
young
officer
with
an
interest
expressing
extreme
sadness
and
such
implied
compassion
on
the
part
of
a
spaniard
might
well
have
caused
the
reverie
of
the
frenchman
clara
was
beautiful
and
though
she
had
three
brothers
and
one
sister
the
wealth
of
the
marquis
de
leganes
seemed
sufficient
to
justify
victor
marchand
in
believing
that
the
young
lady
would
be
richly
dowered
but
could
he
dare
to
believe
that
the
daughter
of
the
proudest
noble
in
spain
would
be
given
to
the
son
of
a
parisian
grocer
besides
frenchmen
were
hated
the
marquis
having
been
suspected
by
general
g
t
r
who
governed
the
province
of
preparing
an
insurrection
in
favor
of
ferdinand
the
battalion
commanded
by
victor
marchand
was
quartered
in
the
little
town
of
menda
to
hold
in
check
the
neighboring
districts
which
were
under
the
control
of
the
marquis
de
leganes
a
recent
despatch
from
marechal
ney
made
it
seem
probable
that
the
english
would
soon
land
a
force
upon
the
coast
and
he
mentioned
the
marquis
as
the
man
who
was
believed
to
be
in
communication
with
the
cabinet
of
london
thus
in
spite
of
the
cordial
welcome
which
that
spaniard
had
given
to
victor
marchand
and
his
soldiers
the
young
officer
held
himself
perpetually
on
his
guard
as
he
came
from
the
ballroom
to
the
terrace
intending
to
cast
his
eye
upon
the
state
of
the
town
and
the
outlying
districts
confided
to
his
care
he
asked
himself
how
he
ought
to
interpret
the
good
will
which
the
marquis
never
failed
to
show
him
and
whether
the
fears
of
his
general
were
warranted
by
the
apparent
tranquillity
of
the
region
but
no
sooner
had
he
reached
the
terrace
than
these
thoughts
were
driven
from
his
mind
by
a
sense
of
prudence
and
also
by
natural
curiosity
he
saw
in
the
town
a
great
number
of
lights
although
it
was
the
feast
of
saint
james
he
had
that
very
morning
ordered
that
all
lights
should
be
put
out
at
the
hour
prescribed
in
the
army
regulations
those
of
the
chateau
alone
excepted
he
saw
it
is
true
the
bayonets
of
his
soldiers
gleaming
here
and
there
at
their
appointed
posts
but
the
silence
was
solemn
and
nothing
indicated
that
the
spaniards
were
disregarding
his
orders
in
the
intoxication
of
a
fete
endeavoring
to
explain
to
himself
this
culpable
and
deliberate
infraction
of
rules
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
it
struck
him
as
the
more
incomprehensible
because
he
had
left
a
number
of
officers
in
charge
of
patrols
who
were
to
make
their
rounds
during
the
night
and
enforce
the
regulations
with
the
impetuosity
of
youth
he
was
about
to
spring
through
an
opening
in
the
terrace
wall
and
descend
by
the
rocks
more
rapidly
than
by
the
usual
road
to
a
little
outpost
which
he
had
placed
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
on
the
side
toward
the
chateau
when
a
slight
noise
arrested
him
he
fancied
he
heard
the
light
step
of
a
woman
on
the
gravelled
path
behind
him
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
no
one
but
his
eyes
were
caught
by
an
extraordinary
light
upon
the
ocean
suddenly
he
beheld
a
sight
so
alarming
that
he
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
with
surprise
fancying
that
his
senses
were
mistaken
the
white
rays
of
the
moonlight
enabled
him
to
distinguish
sails
at
some
distance
he
tried
to
convince
himself
that
this
vision
was
an
optical
delusion
caused
by
the
caprices
of
the
waves
and
the
moon
at
that
moment
a
hoarse
voice
uttered
his
name
he
looked
toward
the
opening
in
the
wall
and
saw
the
head
of
the
orderly
who
had
accompanied
him
to
the
chateau
rising
cautiously
through
it
is
it
you
commander
yes
what
is
it
replied
the
young
man
in
a
low
voice
a
sort
of
presentiment
warning
him
to
act
mysteriously
those
rascals
are
squirming
like
worms
said
the
man
and
i
have
come
if
you
please
to
tell
you
my
little
observations
speak
out
i
have
just
followed
from
the
chateau
a
man
with
a
lantern
who
is
coming
this
way
a
lantern
is
mightily
suspicious
i
do
believe
that
christian
has
any
call
to
go
and
light
the
church
tapers
at
this
time
of
night
they
want
to
murder
us
said
i
to
myself
so
i
followed
his
heels
and
i
discovered
commander
close
by
here
on
a
pile
of
rock
a
great
heap
of
fagots
he
after
lighting
a
beacon
of
some
kind
up
here
i
be
bound
a
terrible
cry
echoing
suddenly
through
the
town
stopped
the
speech
a
brilliant
light
illuminated
the
young
officer
the
poor
orderly
was
shot
in
the
head
and
fell
a
fire
of
straw
and
dry
wood
blazed
up
like
a
conflagration
not
thirty
feet
distant
from
the
young
commander
the
music
and
the
laughter
ceased
in
the
ballroom
the
silence
of
death
broken
only
by
moans
succeeded
to
the
joyous
sounds
of
a
festival
a
single
echoed
along
the
plain
of
the
ocean
a
cold
sweat
rolled
from
the
officer
brow
he
wore
no
sword
he
was
confident
that
his
soldiers
were
murdered
and
that
the
english
were
about
to
disembark
he
saw
himself
dishonored
if
he
lived
summoned
before
a
council
of
war
to
explain
his
want
of
vigilance
then
he
measured
with
his
eye
the
depths
of
the
descent
and
was
springing
towards
it
when
clara
hand
seized
his
fly
she
said
my
brothers
are
following
me
to
kill
you
your
soldiers
are
killed
escape
yourself
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
over
there
see
you
will
find
juanito
barb
go
go
she
pushed
him
but
the
stupefied
young
man
looked
at
her
motionless
for
a
moment
then
obeying
the
instinct
of
which
never
abandons
any
man
even
the
strongest
he
sprang
through
the
park
in
the
direction
indicated
running
among
the
rocks
where
goats
alone
had
hitherto
made
their
way
he
heard
clara
calling
to
her
brothers
to
pursue
him
he
heard
the
steps
of
his
murderers
he
heard
the
balls
of
several
muskets
whistling
about
his
ears
but
he
reached
the
valley
found
the
horse
mounted
him
and
disappeared
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
a
few
hours
later
the
young
officer
reached
the
headquarters
of
general
g
t
r
whom
he
found
at
dinner
with
his
staff
i
bring
you
my
head
cried
the
commander
of
the
lost
battalion
as
he
entered
pale
and
overcome
he
sat
down
and
related
the
horrible
occurrence
an
awful
silence
followed
his
tale
i
think
you
were
more
unfortunate
than
criminal
replied
the
terrible
general
when
at
last
he
spoke
you
are
not
responsible
for
the
crime
of
those
spaniards
and
unless
the
marshal
should
think
otherwise
i
absolve
you
these
words
gave
but
a
feeble
consolation
to
the
unhappy
officer
but
when
the
emperor
hears
of
it
he
cried
he
will
want
to
have
you
shot
said
the
general
but
we
will
see
about
that
now
he
added
in
a
stern
tone
not
another
word
of
this
except
to
turn
it
into
a
vengeance
which
shall
impress
with
salutary
terror
a
people
who
make
war
like
savages
an
hour
later
a
whole
regiment
a
detachment
of
cavalry
and
a
battery
of
artillery
were
on
their
way
to
menda
the
general
and
victor
marched
at
the
head
of
the
column
the
soldiers
informed
of
the
massacre
of
their
comrades
were
possessed
by
fury
the
distance
which
separated
the
town
of
menda
from
general
headquarters
was
marched
with
marvellous
rapidity
on
the
way
the
general
found
all
the
villages
under
arms
each
of
the
wretched
hamlets
was
surrounded
and
the
inhabitants
decimated
by
one
of
those
fatalities
which
are
inexplicable
the
british
ships
lay
to
without
advancing
it
was
known
later
that
these
vessels
carried
the
artillery
and
had
outsailed
the
rest
of
the
transports
thus
the
town
of
menda
deprived
of
the
support
it
expected
and
which
the
appearance
of
the
british
fleet
in
the
offing
had
led
the
inhabitants
to
suppose
was
at
hand
was
surrounded
by
french
troops
almost
without
a
blow
being
struck
the
people
of
the
town
seized
with
terror
offered
to
surrender
at
discretion
with
a
spirit
of
devotion
not
rare
in
the
peninsula
the
slayers
of
the
french
soldiery
fearing
from
the
cruelty
of
their
commander
that
menda
would
be
given
to
the
flames
and
the
whole
population
put
to
the
sword
proposed
to
the
general
to
denounce
themselves
he
accepted
their
offer
making
a
condition
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
chateau
from
the
marquis
to
the
lowest
valet
should
be
delivered
into
his
hands
this
condition
being
agreed
to
the
general
proceeded
to
pardon
the
rest
of
the
population
and
to
prevent
his
soldiers
from
pillaging
the
town
or
setting
fire
to
it
an
enormous
tribute
was
levied
and
the
wealthiest
inhabitants
held
prisoner
to
secure
payment
of
it
which
payment
was
to
be
made
within
hours
the
general
took
all
precautions
necessary
for
the
safety
of
his
troops
and
provided
for
the
defence
of
the
region
from
outside
attack
refusing
to
allow
his
soldiers
to
be
billeted
in
the
houses
after
putting
them
in
camp
he
went
up
to
the
chateau
and
took
possession
of
it
the
members
of
the
leganes
family
and
their
servants
were
bound
and
kept
under
guard
in
the
great
hall
where
the
ball
had
taken
place
the
windows
of
this
room
commanded
the
terrace
which
overhung
the
town
headquarters
were
established
in
one
of
the
galleries
where
the
general
held
in
the
first
place
a
council
as
to
the
measures
that
should
be
taken
to
prevent
the
landing
of
the
british
after
sending
an
to
marechal
ney
and
having
ordered
batteries
to
certain
points
along
the
shore
the
general
and
his
staff
turned
their
attention
to
the
prisoners
two
hundred
spaniards
who
had
delivered
themselves
up
were
immediately
shot
after
this
military
execution
the
general
ordered
as
many
gibbets
planted
on
the
terrace
as
there
were
members
of
the
family
of
leganes
and
he
sent
for
the
executioner
of
the
town
victor
marchand
took
advantage
of
the
hour
before
dinner
to
go
and
see
the
prisoners
before
long
he
returned
to
the
general
i
have
come
he
said
in
a
voice
full
of
feeling
to
ask
for
mercy
you
said
the
general
in
a
tone
of
bitter
irony
alas
replied
victor
it
is
only
a
sad
mercy
the
marquis
who
has
seen
those
gibbets
set
up
hopes
that
you
will
change
that
mode
of
execution
he
asks
you
to
behead
his
family
as
befits
nobility
so
be
it
replied
the
general
they
also
ask
for
religious
assistance
and
to
be
released
from
their
bonds
they
promise
in
return
to
make
no
attempt
to
escape
i
consent
said
the
general
but
i
make
you
responsible
for
them
the
marquis
offers
you
his
whole
fortune
if
you
will
consent
to
pardon
one
of
his
sons
really
exclaimed
the
general
his
property
belongs
already
to
king
joseph
he
stopped
a
thought
a
contemptuous
thought
wrinkled
his
brow
and
he
said
presently
i
will
surpass
his
wishes
i
comprehend
the
importance
of
his
last
request
well
he
shall
buy
the
continuance
of
his
name
and
lineage
but
spain
shall
forever
connect
with
it
the
memory
of
his
treachery
and
his
punishment
i
will
give
life
and
his
whole
fortune
to
whichever
of
his
sons
will
perform
the
office
of
executioner
on
the
rest
go
not
another
word
to
me
on
the
subject
dinner
was
served
the
officers
satisfied
an
appetite
sharpened
by
exertion
a
single
one
of
them
victor
marchand
was
not
at
the
feast
after
hesitating
long
he
returned
to
the
hall
where
the
proud
family
of
leganes
were
prisoners
casting
a
mournful
look
on
the
scene
now
presented
in
that
apartment
where
only
two
nights
before
he
had
seen
the
heads
of
the
two
young
girls
and
the
three
young
men
turning
giddily
in
the
waltz
he
shuddered
as
he
thought
how
soon
they
would
fall
struck
off
by
the
sabre
of
the
executioner
bound
in
their
gilded
chairs
the
father
and
mother
the
three
sons
and
the
two
daughters
sat
rigid
in
a
state
of
complete
immobility
eight
servants
stood
near
them
their
arms
bound
behind
their
backs
these
fifteen
persons
looked
at
one
another
gravely
their
eyes
scarcely
betraying
the
sentiments
that
filled
their
souls
the
sentinels
also
motionless
watched
them
but
respected
the
sorrow
of
those
cruel
enemies
an
expression
of
inquiry
came
upon
the
faces
of
all
when
victor
appeared
he
gave
the
order
to
unbind
the
prisoners
and
went
himself
to
unfasten
the
cords
that
held
clara
in
her
chair
she
smiled
sadly
the
officer
could
not
help
touching
softly
the
arms
of
the
young
girl
as
he
looked
with
sad
admiration
at
her
beautiful
hair
and
her
supple
figure
she
was
a
true
spaniard
having
the
spanish
complexion
the
spanish
eyes
with
their
curved
lashes
and
their
large
pupils
blacker
than
a
wing
have
you
succeeded
she
said
with
one
of
those
funereal
smiles
in
which
something
of
girlhood
lingers
victor
could
not
keep
himself
from
groaning
he
looked
in
turn
at
the
three
brothers
and
then
at
clara
one
brother
the
eldest
was
thirty
years
of
age
though
small
and
somewhat
with
an
air
that
was
haughty
and
disdainful
he
was
not
lacking
in
a
certain
nobility
of
manner
and
he
seemed
to
have
something
of
that
delicacy
of
feeling
which
made
the
spanish
chivalry
of
other
days
so
famous
he
was
named
juanito
the
second
son
felipe
was
about
twenty
years
of
age
he
resembled
clara
the
youngest
was
eight
a
painter
would
have
seen
in
the
features
of
manuelo
a
little
of
that
roman
constancy
that
david
has
given
to
children
in
his
republican
pages
the
head
of
the
old
marquis
covered
with
flowing
white
hair
seemed
to
have
escaped
from
a
picture
of
murillo
as
he
looked
at
them
the
young
officer
shook
his
head
despairing
that
any
one
of
those
four
beings
would
accept
the
dreadful
bargain
of
the
general
nevertheless
he
found
courage
to
reveal
it
to
clara
the
girl
shuddered
for
a
moment
then
she
recovered
her
calmness
and
went
to
her
father
kneeling
at
his
feet
oh
she
said
to
him
make
juanito
swear
that
he
will
obey
faithfully
the
orders
that
you
will
give
him
and
our
wishes
will
be
fulfilled
the
marquise
quivered
with
hope
but
when
leaning
against
her
husband
she
heard
the
horrible
confidence
that
clara
now
made
to
him
the
mother
fainted
juanito
on
hearing
the
offer
bounded
like
a
lion
in
his
cage
victor
took
upon
himself
to
send
the
guard
away
after
obtaining
from
the
marquis
a
promise
of
absolute
submission
the
servants
were
delivered
to
the
executioner
who
hanged
them
when
the
family
were
alone
with
no
one
but
victor
to
watch
them
the
old
father
rose
juanito
he
said
juanito
answered
only
with
a
motion
of
his
head
that
signified
refusal
falling
back
into
his
chair
and
looking
at
his
parents
with
dry
and
awful
eyes
clara
went
up
to
him
with
a
cheerful
air
and
sat
upon
his
knee
dear
juanito
she
said
passing
her
arm
around
his
neck
and
kissing
his
eyelids
if
you
knew
how
sweet
death
would
seem
to
me
if
given
by
you
think
i
should
be
spared
the
odious
touch
of
an
executioner
you
would
save
me
from
all
the
woes
that
await
me
and
oh
dear
juanito
you
would
not
have
me
belong
to
any
one
therefore
her
velvet
eyes
cast
gleams
of
fire
at
victor
as
if
to
rouse
in
the
heart
of
juanito
his
hatred
of
the
french
have
courage
said
his
brother
felipe
otherwise
our
race
our
almost
royal
race
must
die
extinct
suddenly
clara
rose
the
group
that
had
formed
about
juanito
separated
and
the
son
rebellious
with
good
reason
saw
before
him
his
old
father
standing
erect
who
said
in
solemn
tones
juanito
i
command
you
to
obey
the
young
count
remained
immovable
then
his
father
knelt
at
his
feet
involuntarily
clara
felipe
and
manuelo
imitated
his
action
they
all
stretched
out
their
hands
to
him
who
was
to
save
the
family
from
extinction
and
each
seemed
to
echo
the
words
of
the
father
my
son
can
it
be
that
you
would
fail
in
spanish
energy
and
true
feeling
will
you
leave
me
longer
on
my
knees
why
do
you
consider
life
sufferings
only
is
this
my
son
he
added
turning
to
his
wife
he
consents
cried
the
mother
in
despair
seeing
a
motion
of
juanito
eyelids
the
meaning
of
which
was
known
to
her
alone
mariquita
the
second
daughter
was
on
her
knees
pressing
her
mother
in
her
feeble
arms
and
as
she
wept
hot
tears
her
little
brother
scolded
her
at
this
moment
the
chaplain
of
the
chateau
entered
the
hall
the
family
instantly
surrounded
him
and
led
him
to
juanito
victor
unable
to
endure
the
scene
any
longer
made
a
sign
to
clara
and
went
away
determined
to
make
one
more
attempt
upon
the
general
he
found
him
in
fine
in
the
midst
of
a
banquet
drinking
with
his
officers
who
were
growing
hilarious
an
hour
later
one
hundred
of
the
leading
inhabitants
of
menda
assembled
on
the
terrace
according
to
the
orders
of
the
general
to
witness
the
execution
of
the
leganes
family
a
detachment
of
soldiers
were
posted
to
restrain
the
spaniards
stationed
beneath
the
gallows
on
which
the
servants
had
been
hanged
the
heads
of
the
burghers
almost
touched
the
feet
of
these
martyrs
thirty
feet
from
this
group
was
a
block
and
on
it
glittered
a
scimitar
an
executioner
was
present
in
case
juanito
refused
his
obedience
at
the
last
moment
soon
the
spaniards
heard
in
the
midst
of
the
deepest
silence
the
steps
of
many
persons
the
measured
sound
of
the
march
of
soldiers
and
the
slight
rattle
of
their
accoutrements
these
noises
mingled
with
the
gay
laughter
of
the
officers
as
a
few
nights
earlier
the
dances
of
a
ball
had
served
to
mask
the
preparations
for
a
bloody
treachery
all
eyes
turned
to
the
chateau
and
saw
the
noble
family
advancing
with
inconceivable
composure
their
faces
were
serene
and
calm
one
member
alone
pale
undone
leaned
upon
the
priest
who
spent
his
powers
of
religious
consolation
upon
this
man
the
only
one
who
was
to
live
the
executioner
knew
as
did
all
present
that
juanito
had
agreed
to
accept
his
place
for
that
one
day
the
old
marquis
and
his
wife
clara
mariquita
and
the
two
younger
brothers
walked
forward
and
knelt
down
a
few
steps
distant
from
the
fatal
block
juanito
was
led
forward
by
the
priest
when
he
reached
the
place
the
executioner
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
gave
him
probably
a
few
instructions
the
confessor
meantime
turned
the
victims
so
that
they
might
not
see
the
fatal
blows
but
like
true
spaniards
they
stood
erect
without
faltering
clara
was
the
first
to
come
forward
juanito
she
said
have
pity
on
my
want
of
courage
begin
with
me
at
this
instant
the
hurried
steps
of
a
man
were
heard
and
victor
marchand
appeared
on
the
terrace
clara
was
already
on
her
knees
her
white
neck
bared
for
the
scimitar
the
officer
turned
pale
but
he
ran
with
all
his
might
the
general
grants
your
life
if
you
will
marry
me
he
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
the
spanish
girl
cast
upon
the
officer
a
look
of
pride
and
contempt
go
on
juanito
she
said
in
a
deep
voice
and
her
head
rolled
at
victor
feet
the
marquise
de
leganes
made
one
convulsive
movement
as
she
heard
that
sound
it
was
the
only
sign
she
gave
of
sorrow
am
i
placed
right
this
way
my
good
juanito
asked
the
little
manuelo
of
his
brother
ah
you
are
weeping
mariquita
said
juanito
to
his
sister
yes
she
said
i
think
of
you
my
poor
juanito
how
lonely
you
will
be
without
us
soon
the
grand
figure
of
the
marquis
came
forward
he
looked
at
the
blood
of
his
children
he
turned
to
the
mute
and
motionless
spectators
and
said
in
a
strong
voice
stretching
his
hands
toward
juanito
spaniards
i
give
my
son
my
fatherly
blessing
now
strike
without
fear
you
are
without
reproach
but
when
juanito
saw
his
mother
approach
him
supported
by
the
priest
he
cried
out
she
bore
me
a
cry
of
horror
broke
from
all
present
the
noise
of
the
feast
and
the
jovial
laughter
of
the
officers
ceased
at
that
terrible
clamor
the
marquise
comprehended
that
juanito
courage
was
exhausted
and
springing
with
one
bound
over
the
parapet
she
was
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
below
a
sound
of
admiration
rose
juanito
had
fallen
senseless
general
said
an
officer
who
was
half
drunk
marchand
has
just
told
me
the
particulars
of
that
execution
down
there
i
will
bet
you
never
ordered
it
do
you
forget
messieurs
cried
general
g
t
r
that
five
hundred
french
families
are
plunged
in
affliction
and
that
we
are
now
in
spain
do
you
wish
to
leave
our
bones
in
its
soil
after
that
allocution
no
one
not
even
a
had
the
courage
to
empty
his
glass
in
spite
of
the
respect
with
which
he
is
surrounded
in
spite
of
the
title
el
verdugo
the
executioner
which
the
king
of
spain
bestowed
as
a
title
of
nobility
on
the
marquis
de
leganes
he
is
a
prey
to
sorrow
he
lives
in
solitude
and
is
seldom
seen
overwhelmed
with
the
burden
of
his
noble
crime
he
seems
to
await
with
impatience
the
birth
of
a
second
son
which
will
give
him
the
right
to
rejoin
the
shades
who
ceaselessly
accompany
him
