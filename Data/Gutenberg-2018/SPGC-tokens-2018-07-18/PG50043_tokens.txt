preface
i
once
in
a
generation
an
author
surpasses
the
bounds
of
nationality
of
such
cosmopolitan
artists
maurice
maeterlinck
is
perhaps
the
most
shining
example
twenty
years
ago
i
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
interest
english
publishers
in
his
plays
i
am
asked
to
produce
a
version
of
one
of
his
earlier
and
less
familiar
works
because
the
time
is
approaching
for
that
monument
to
his
fame
which
so
few
writers
enjoy
in
their
lifetime
namely
the
complete
edition
he
is
not
a
belgian
writer
merely
or
chiefly
above
all
he
is
an
english
an
american
author
his
readers
in
england
and
the
united
states
far
outnumber
those
who
read
the
original
french
his
books
are
published
in
england
and
america
almost
as
soon
as
they
appear
in
france
and
belgium
and
in
at
least
one
case
the
english
publication
was
the
earlier
more
and
more
do
his
lovers
demand
every
word
that
his
pen
has
formed
sooner
or
later
therefore
it
was
inevitable
that
these
poems
should
appear
in
translation
ii
the
poems
contained
in
this
volume
form
part
of
a
movement
long
defunct
the
belgian
symbolist
movement
an
offshoot
of
that
belgian
renascence
which
produced
so
remarkable
a
body
of
great
and
noble
poetry
i
can
not
say
however
that
perusal
of
the
other
poets
of
the
period
will
assist
the
reader
to
appreciate
the
volume
in
hand
eekhoud
elskamp
gilkin
rodenbach
verhaeren
none
of
these
wrote
verse
which
could
possibly
be
confounded
with
that
of
maeterlinck
twenty
years
ago
the
latter
was
no
less
original
than
he
is
many
poets
of
the
late
nineteenth
century
were
without
being
symbolists
affected
by
the
symbolist
movement
a
movement
very
loosely
named
since
the
actual
symbolists
connected
with
it
could
be
counted
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
more
particularly
were
they
influenced
by
the
tendency
to
put
music
before
matter
beauty
before
sense
which
is
expressed
by
the
so
familiar
lines
of
verlaine
de
la
musique
avant
toute
chose
et
pour
cela
préfère
plus
vague
et
plus
soluble
dans
sans
rien
en
lui
qui
pèse
ou
pose
de
la
musique
encor
et
toujours
but
musical
as
maeterlinck
verses
are
and
rich
in
sheer
beauty
we
are
very
seldom
in
doubt
as
to
what
the
poet
says
however
little
we
may
in
some
cases
understand
what
he
means
his
statements
are
concrete
and
lucid
it
is
the
inner
meaning
the
soul
of
his
verse
that
sometimes
threatens
to
elude
us
had
this
volume
been
cast
upon
the
late
victorian
world
this
preface
would
perhaps
have
been
longer
but
i
can
not
believe
that
these
poems
will
present
any
difficulties
to
a
generation
which
has
degustated
such
phenomena
as
cubism
and
its
kindred
manifestations
iii
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
the
writer
of
these
poems
had
read
his
verlaine
his
rimbaud
his
mallarmé
and
his
baudelaire
and
of
poets
emerson
poe
perhaps
rossetti
and
above
all
whitman
but
he
is
no
disciple
and
his
essential
originality
and
the
keynote
of
his
aesthetics
is
a
system
of
symbolism
now
here
at
once
we
are
on
dangerous
ground
when
a
poet
makes
use
of
a
symbol
it
is
because
that
symbol
enables
him
to
say
something
that
he
can
not
say
so
well
or
so
beautifully
or
perhaps
at
all
in
plain
language
he
is
a
rash
man
therefore
who
will
attempt
to
elucidate
another
symbolism
however
i
have
already
been
rash
in
venturing
to
translate
not
a
few
selected
lyrics
but
an
entire
volume
of
verse
from
cover
to
cover
than
which
there
is
no
more
appalling
task
in
literature
but
i
am
not
therefore
disposed
to
court
disaster
by
attempting
any
detailed
or
positive
explanation
i
could
indeed
have
asked
maeterlinck
for
such
but
at
the
moment
of
writing
his
country
is
being
crucified
by
the
powers
of
darkness
and
he
has
other
and
sterner
matters
to
think
of
this
machinery
of
hospitals
and
what
not
what
are
we
to
make
of
it
i
do
not
think
we
shall
go
far
wrong
in
supposing
the
the
the
the
hospital
to
typify
the
isolation
and
insulation
caused
by
a
false
civilization
and
an
unreal
religion
so
productive
of
hypocrisy
fear
and
confusion
that
each
man
is
a
prisoner
within
himself
unable
to
reach
his
fellow
and
the
inmates
of
the
the
strange
growths
the
fantastic
visions
the
violent
antitheses
and
incongruities
these
we
may
take
it
are
the
morbidities
fostered
by
a
life
which
protects
us
and
them
from
the
agencies
by
which
nature
makes
her
own
children
perfect
in
strength
and
beauty
and
service
that
is
my
reading
of
it
the
reader
is
perfectly
free
to
differ
from
me
and
will
lose
little
by
so
doing
if
i
have
succeeded
in
preserving
a
tithe
of
the
original
beauty
of
the
verse
if
here
and
there
more
particularly
in
the
unrhymed
pieces
the
violent
and
intentional
incongruities
and
antitheses
seem
startling
and
incomprehensible
and
a
little
apt
to
tickle
the
risibility
of
the
frivolous
let
us
remember
that
to
read
a
symbolic
poem
literally
is
as
foolish
as
to
seek
for
a
cipher
in
shakespeare
or
to
set
about
interpreting
a
melody
in
terms
of
its
notation
in
the
hope
of
spelling
out
a
message
one
peculiarity
of
maeterlinck
which
may
at
first
confuse
the
english
reader
is
only
a
simple
convention
all
poetry
is
full
of
similes
the
simile
confuses
no
one
if
a
poet
tells
us
that
his
heart
is
like
a
we
do
not
seriously
suppose
him
to
mean
that
his
heart
has
feathers
and
two
legs
but
merely
that
it
possesses
some
other
essential
quality
of
a
now
maeterlinck
constantly
in
his
verse
uses
what
is
merely
a
modification
of
the
simile
which
has
precisely
the
same
significance
but
which
takes
the
form
of
a
positive
assertion
of
identity
he
would
say
my
heart
a
or
a
plant
in
a
or
anything
else
that
seemed
to
be
illuminating
and
this
apparent
literalness
of
statement
which
is
carried
very
far
is
and
must
always
be
understood
as
a
mere
variant
of
the
familiar
simile
iv
a
word
as
to
the
work
of
translation
most
of
the
lyrics
in
are
written
in
the
metre
familiar
to
english
readers
as
that
of
in
memoriam
it
is
in
english
rather
a
dull
metre
the
stanza
being
in
reality
no
stanza
at
all
but
merely
a
line
of
syllables
with
interior
rhymes
it
is
greatly
improved
and
enlivened
by
the
omission
of
four
syllables
or
rather
by
their
replacement
by
pauses
of
one
syllable
value
this
change
i
have
sometimes
made
and
in
one
case
i
have
in
order
to
avoid
a
verbal
obscurity
extended
the
line
to
ten
syllables
apart
from
these
exceptions
all
the
poems
in
this
volume
are
translated
into
their
original
metres
and
it
has
always
been
my
first
object
to
produce
a
literal
almost
a
word
for
word
translation
whatever
the
faults
of
my
version
it
is
strictly
faithful
if
i
am
deemed
to
have
also
preserved
something
of
the
beauty
of
the
original
i
shall
feel
more
than
rewarded
for
a
task
that
has
presented
many
difficulties

unborn

languid
light

the
house

o
blue
monotony
of
my
heart

with
languor
are
my
dreams

mournful
moonlight
seems
clearer
vision
to
impart
blue
as
is
the
house
of
shade
close
within
whose
lofty
green
casements
whose
pellucid
screen
seems
of
crystal
moonlight
made
mighty
vegetations
rise
whose
nocturnal
shadow
deep
silent
as
a
charmed
sleep
over
passion
roses
lies
where
waters
gleam
mingling
moon

throb

eternal
glaucous
sob
monotonously
as
in

temptations
green
as

entwined

ejaculations
leap
stems

coil

thrust
in

unhallowed
glow
and
the
autumnal
shadows
throw
of
their
auguries
of
lust
and
the
moon
may
hardly
shine
through
their
fevered
fast
embrace
limb
and
slimy
limb
enlace
emerald
and
serpentine
sacrilegiously
they
grow
and
their
secret
will
reveal
dismal
as
regrets
that
steal
men
dying
in
the
snow
and
their
mournful
shadows
hide
tangled
wounds
that
mark
the
thrust
of
the
azure
swords
of
lust
in
the
crimson
flesh
of
pride
when
will
the
dreams
of
earth
alas
find
in
my
heart
their
final
tomb
o
let
thy
glory
lord
illume
this
dark
and
evil
house
of
glass

that
oblivion
nought
may
win
the
dead
leaves
of
their
fevers
fall
the
stars
between
their
lips
and
all
the
visceræ
of
woe
and
sin
o
domes
of
crystal
o
curious
plants
forever
sheltered
while
the
wind
stirs
my
senses
here
without
a
valley
of
the
soul
forever
undisturbed

humid
warmth

noon
o
shifting

crystal
walls

upon

pools

through

prisoned
foliage
there
you
may
see
a
beggar
upon
a
throne

maybe
pirates

upon
a
pond

antediluvian
beasts
about
to
invade

cities

have
been

on
ancient
drifts

some
on
pools

rain

fallen

imprisoned
air

hear
them
keeping
carnival
on
a
sabbath
in
time
of
famine
i
see
an
ambulance
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
of
harvest
and
all
the
king
daughters
on
a
day
of
fast
are
wandering
through
the
meadows

especially
those
on
the
horizon
carefully
they
cover
the
tempests
of
long
ago
somewhere
i
think
you
will
see
a
great
armada
sailing
across
a
swamp
and
there
the
brooding
swans
have
hatched
a
nest
of
crows
it
is
hard
to
see
through
the
veil
of
moisture
and
a
maiden
is
watering
the
heath
with
steaming
water
a
troop
of
little
girls
is
watching
the
hermit
in
his
cell
and
i
see
my
sisters
asleep
in
the
depth
of
a
poisonous
cavern
wait
until
the
moonlight
wait
until
the
winter
shall
cover
these
domes
of
crystal
set
amid
ice
and
snow
the
humble
offering
i
bring
my
piteous
work
in
form
like
the
dreaming
of
a
corse
and
the
moon
illumes
the
storm
the
creatures
of
remorse
there
the
purple
snakes
of
dream
writhing
twine
till
sleep
be
done
crowned
with
swords
my
longings

lions
are
whelmed
in
the
sun
lilies
in
waters
desolate
clenched
hands
that
may
not
move
and
the
ruddy
stems
of
hate
bearing
verdant
woes
of
love
lord
pity
our
mortal
speech
o
that
my
prayers
morose
and
dim
with
the
dishevelled
moon
may
reach
and
reap

night
to
the
world

air
fills
with
glimmering
light

helpless

soul
beholds
with
dread

bitter
musings

my
lips
amid

crowding
o
that
this
wavering
heart
were
dead
the
soul
my
soul
o
my
soul
verily
too
closely
sheltered
and
the
flocks
of
my
desires
imprisoned
in
a
house
of
glass
waiting
until
the
tempest
break
upon
the
meadows
come
first
of
all
to
these
so
sick
and
fragile
from
these
a
strange
effluvium
rises
and
lo
it
seems
i
am
with
my
mother
crossing
a
field
of
battle
they
are
burying
a
at
noon
while
the
sentinels
are
snatching
a
meal
now
let
us
go
to
the
feeblest
these
are
covered
with
a
strange
sweat
here
is
an
ailing
bride
and
an
act
of
treachery
done
upon
a
sabbath
and
little
children
in
prison
and
yonder
yonder
through
the
mist
do
i
see
there
a
woman
dying
at
the
door
of
a
kitchen
or
a
sister
of
charity
shelling
peas
at
the
bedside
of
a
dying
patient
last
of
all
let
us
go
to
the
saddest
last
of
all
for
these
are
venom
o
my
lips
are
pressed
by
the
kisses
of
a
wounded
man
in
the
castles
of
my
soul
this
summer
all
the
chatelaines
have
died
of
hunger
now
it
is
twilight
on
the
morning

a
day

catch
a
glimpse
of
sheep
along
the
quays
and
there
is
a
sail
by
the
windows
of
the
hospital
the
road
is
long
from
my
heart
to
my
soul
and
all
the
sentinels
have
died
at
their
posts
one
day
there
was
a
poor
little
festival
in
the
suburbs
of
my
soul
they
were
mowing
the
hemlock
there
one
sunday
morning
and
all
the
maiden
women
of
the
convent
were
watching
the
passing
vessels
on
the
canal
one
sunny
but
the
swans
were
ailing
in
the
shadow
of
the
rotting
bridge
they
were
lopping
the
trees
about
the
prison
they
were
bringing
remedies
on
an
afternoon
of
june
and
on
every
hand
there
were
sick
folk
feasting
alas
my
soul
and
alas
the
sadness
of
all
these
things
lassitude
these
lips
have
long
forgotten
to
bestow
their
kiss
on
blind
eyes
chiller
than
the
snow
henceforth
absorbed
in
their
magnificent
dream
drowsy
as
hounds
deep
in
the
grass
they
seem
they
watch
the
grey
flocks
on
the
pass
browsing
on
moonlight
scattered
the
grass
by
skies
as
vague
as
their
own
life
caressed
they
see
unvexed
by
envy
or
unrest
the
roses
of
joy
that
open
on
every
hand
the
long
green
peace
they
can
not
understand
the
weary
hunting
my
soul
is
sick
in
an
evil
mood
stricken
with
many
a
lack
it
lies
stricken
with
silence
and
mine
eyes
illume
it
with
their
lassitude
arrested
visions
of
the
chase
obsess
me
memory
whips
them
on
the
of
desire
are
gone
on
fading
scents
a
weary
race
in
misty
woods
the
hunt
is
met
the
questing
packs
of
dreams
depart
toward
the
white
stags
of
falsehood
dart
the
jaundiced
arrows
of
regret
ah
my
desires
for
breath
they
swoon
the
wearied
longings
of
mine
eyes
have
clouded
with
their
azure
sighs
within
my
soul
the
flooding
moon
the
passions
narrow
paths
my
passions
tread
laughter
rings
there
sorrow
cries
sick
and
sad
with
eyes
thro
the
leaves
the
woods
have
shed
my
sins
like
yellow
mongrels
slink
uncouth
hyænas
my
hates
complain
and
on
the
pale
and
listless
plain
couching
low
love
lions
blink
powerless
deep
in
a
dream
of
peace
sunk
in
a
languid
spell
they
lie
under
a
colourless
desolate
sky
there
they
gaze
and
never
cease
where
like
sheep
temptations
graze
one
by
one
departing
slow
in
the
moon
unchanging
glow
my
unchanging
passions
gaze
prayer
a
woman
fears
my
heart
control
what
have
i
done
with
these
my
part
my
hands
the
lilies
of
my
soul
mine
eyes
the
heavens
of
my
heart
o
lord
have
pity
on
my
grief
i
have
lost
the
palm
and
ring
alas
pity
my
prayers
my
poor
relief
cut
flowers
and
fragile
in
a
glass
pity
the
trespass
of
my
mouth
and
things
undone
and
words
unsaid
shed
lilies
on
my
fever
drouth
and
roses
on
the
marshes
shed
o
god
the
doves
whose
flights
are
gold
on
heavens
remembered
pity
too
these
garments
that
my
loins
enfold
that
rustle
round
me
dimly
blue
stagnant
hours
here
are
the
old
desires
that
pass
the
dreams
of
weary
men
that
die
the
dreams
that
faint
and
fail
alas
and
there
the
days
of
hope
gone
by
where
to
fly
shall
we
find
a
place
never
a
star
shines
late
or
soon
weariness
only
with
frozen
face
and
sheets
of
blue
in
the
icy
moon
behold
the
fireless
sick
and
lo
the
sobbing
victims
of
the
snare
lambs
whose
pasture
is
only
snow
pity
them
all
o
lord
my
prayer
for
me
i
wait
the
awakening
call
i
pray
that
slumber
leave
me
soon
i
wait
until
the
sunlight
fall
on
hands
yet
frozen
by
the
moon
the
white
birds
proud
indifferent
slow
they
have
fled
they
have
flown
away
the
peacocks
white
as
snow
lest
weariness
awake
i
see
the
birds
of
snow
the
white
birds
of
the
birds
that
fly
away
before
my
slumber
break
proud
indifferent
slow
the
white
birds
of
winning
with
indolent
flight
the
shores
of
the
sunless
lake
the
birds
of
listless
thought
i
hear
them
on
their
way
indolently
waiting
for
the
sunless
day
to
break
the
hospital
the
hospital
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
the
hospital
and
the
month
july
they
are
lighting
a
fire
in
the
ward
while
the
atlantic
steamers
are
whistling
on
the
canal
do
not
go
near
the
windows
here
are
emigrants
loitering
through
a
palace
and
i
see
a
yacht
in
a
tempest
and
herds
of
cattle
on
all
the
ships
it
is
better
to
keep
the
windows
fastened
then
we
are
all
but
safe
from
the
outside
world
one
thinks
of
a
placed
upon
a
or
a
woman
being
churched
on
a
day
of
thunder
one
catches
a
glimpse
of
plants
scattered
over
a
blanket
and
a
conflagration
on
a
sunny
day
and
i
pass
through
a
forest
full
of
wounded
men
o
here
at
last
is
the
moonlight
a
fountain
is
playing
in
the
middle
of
the
ward
and
a
troop
of
little
girls
has
opened
the
door
and
lo
a
glimpse
of
lambs
in
an
isle
of
meadows
and
beautiful
plants
on
a
glacier
and
lilies
in
a
hall
of
marble
there
is
a
banquet
in
a
virgin
forest
and
the
vegetation
of
the
tropics
in
a
cavern
of
ice
listen
they
are
opening
the
locks
and
the
ocean
steamers
are
churning
the
waters
of
the
canal
but
see
the
sister
of
charity
is
making
up
the
fire
all
the
lovely
green
rushes
of
the
banks
are
in
flames
and
a
boat
full
of
wounded
men
is
tossing
in
the
moonlight
all
the
king
daughters
are
out
in
a
boat
in
the
storm
and
the
princesses
are
dying
in
a
field
of
hemlock
oh
do
not
unfasten
the
windows
listen
the
ocean
steamers
are
still
hooting
on
the
horizon
they
are
poisoning
someone
in
a
garden
they
are
holding
a
splendid
festival
in
the
houses
of
the
enemy
there
are
deer
in
a
beleaguered
city
and
a
menagerie
in
a
garden
of
lilies
and
the
jungle
of
the
tropics
in
the
depths
of
a
a
flock
of
sheep
is
crossing
an
iron
bridge
and
the
lambs
have
come
from
the
meadows
and
are
mournfully
entering
the
ward
now
the
sister
of
charity
is
lighting
the
lamps
now
she
is
bringing
the
patients
their
supper
she
has
closed
the
windows
upon
the
canal
and
all
the
doors
to
the
light
of
the
moon
night
prayer
below
the
somnolence
of
prayer
under
languid
visions
i
hear
the
passions
surge
and
cry
lust
with
lust
is
warring
there
thro
the
lassitude
of
dreams
shines
the
moon
as
thro
a
mesh
and
the
wandering
joy
of
flesh
still
on
pestilent
beaches
gleams
under
skies
thirsting
for
their
starry
fires
thro
my
veins
i
hear
desires
toward
the
green
horizon
rise
evil
fondnesses
i
hear
blackly
surging
through
my
mind
phantom
marshes
vanish
blind
sudden
on
the
drear
o
lord
thy
wrath
will
slay
me
soon
have
pity
on
me
lord
i
pray
sweating
and
sick
o
let
me
stray
thro
pastures
glimmering
in
the
moon
for
now
o
lord
the
time
is
nigh
to
rase
the
hemlock
with
the
steel
whose
moon
my
secret
hopes
reveal
green
as
a
serpent
in
the
sky
and
the
plague
of
dreams
mine
eyes
smites
and
all
its
sins
subdue
and
the
rustling
fountains
blue
toward
the
sovereign
moon
arise
wintry
desires
i
mourn
the
lips
of
yesterday
lips
whose
kisses
are
yet
unborn
and
the
old
desires
outworn
under
sorrows
hid
away
always
rain
on
the
far
always
snow
on
the
beaches
gleams
while
by
the
bolted
gate
of
dreams
crouching
wolves
in
the
grasses
whine
into
my
listless
soul
i
gaze
with
clouded
eyes
i
search
the
past
at
all
the
blood
aghast
of
lambs
that
died
in
wintry
ways
only
the
moon
its
mournful
fires
enkindles
and
a
desolate
light
falls
where
the
autumn
frosts
are
white
over
my
famishing
desires
listlessness
i
sing
the
pale
ballades
of
eld
of
kisses
lost
without
reward
and
lo
on
love
luxurious
sward
the
nuptials
of
the
sick
are
held
voices
thro
my
slumber
sound
listlessly
they
gather
near
lilies
bloom
in
closes
where
star
nor
sun
hath
blessed
the
ground
and
lo
these
ghosts
of
old
desire
these
lagging
throbs
of
impulse
crost
are
paupers
in
a
palace
lost
sick
tapers
in
the
auroral
fire
when
shall
the
moon
my
vision
bathe
that
seeks
to
plume
the
eternal
streams
of
darkness
and
about
my
dreams
her
slow
cerulean
raiment
swathe
amen
at
length
the
consecrating
hour
is
here
that
sains
the
slave
extenuated
sleep
and
i
who
wait
shall
see
its
hands
appear
full
of
white
roses
in
these
caverns
deep
i
wait
at
length
to
feel
its
cooling
wind
strike
on
my
heart
impregnable
to
lies
a
paschal
lamb
lost
amid
marshes
blind
a
wound
which
the
surging
waters
rise
i
wait
for
nights
no
morrow
shall
defy
i
wait
for
weakness
nothing
shall
avail
to
feel
upon
my
hands
its
shadow
lie
to
see
in
peaceful
tides
its
image
pale
i
wait
until
those
nights
of
thine
shall
show
all
my
desires
with
cleansed
eyes
go
by
for
then
my
dreams
shall
bathe
in
evening
glow
and
then
within
their
crystal
castle
die
the
diving
bell
lo
the
diver
forever
within
his
bell
and
a
whole
sea
of
glass
a
sea
eternally
warm
a
whole
motionless
world
a
world
of
slow
green
rhythms
so
many
curious
creatures
beyond
those
walls
of
glass
and
any
contact
eternally
prohibited
and
yet
there
is
so
much
life
in
those
bright
waters
yonder
look
the
shadows
of
great
they
glide
over
the
flowers
the
dahlias
of
the
submarine
forest
and
i
stand
for
a
moment
in
the
shadow
of
whales
that
are
voyaging
to
the
pole
and
at
this
very
moment
i
doubt
not
my
in
the
harbour
are
discharging
the
vessels
that
sail
hither
laden
with
ice
a
glacier
was
there
in
the
midst
of
the
july
meadows
and
men
are
swimming
and
floating
in
the
green
waters
of
the
creek
and
at
noon
they
enter
shadowy
caverns
and
the
breezes
of
ocean
are
fanning
the
roofs
and
balconies
lo
the
flaming
tongues
of
the
take
heed
lest
their
kisses
touch
the
walls
of
lassitude
they
have
ceased
to
lay
ice
on
the
brows
of
the
fevered
and
the
patients
have
lit
a
bonfire
and
are
casting
great
handfuls
of
green
lilies
into
the
flames
lean
your
brows
upon
the
cooler
panes
while
waiting
for
the
moonlight
to
enter
the
bell
from
above
and
close
your
eyes
tightly
to
the
forest
of
colour
the
pendulous
blues
and
albuminous
violets
and
close
your
ears
to
the
suggestions
of
the
tepid
water
dry
the
brows
of
your
desires
they
are
weak
with
sweat
go
firstly
to
those
on
the
point
of
swooning
they
have
the
air
of
people
celebrating
a
wedding
in
a
dungeon
or
of
people
entering
at
a
long
avenue
underground
in
festival
procession
they
are
passing
thro
a
landscape
like
an
orphaned
childhood
go
now
to
those
about
to
die
they
move
like
virgins
who
have
wandered
far
in
the
sun
on
a
day
of
fast
they
are
pale
as
patients
who
placidly
listen
to
the
rain
in
the
gardens
of
the
hospital
they
have
the
look
of
survivors
breaking
their
fast
on
a
they
are
like
prisoners
who
know
that
all
their
gaolers
are
bathing
in
the
river
and
who
hear
men
mowing
the
grass
in
the
garden
of
the
prison
aquarium
now
my
desires
no
more
alas
summon
my
soul
to
my
eyelids
brink
for
with
its
prayers
that
ebb
and
pass
it
too
must
sink
to
lie
in
the
depth
of
my
closed
eyes
only
the
flowers
of
its
weary
breath
like
icy
blooms
to
the
surface
rise
lilies
of
death
its
lips
are
sealed
in
the
depths
of
woe
and
a
world
away
in
the
gloom
they
sing
of
azure
stems
that
grow
a
mystic
bloom
but
lo
its
fingers
i
have
grown
pallid
beholding
them
i
who
perceive
them
trace
the
marks
its
poor
unblown
lost
lilies
leave
i
know
it
must
die
for
its
hour
is
folding
its
impotent
hands
at
last
hands
too
weary
to
pluck
any
more
the
flowers
of
the
past
the
i
watch
the
hours
of
long
ago
their
blue
and
secret
depths
i
set
under
the
regret
and
watch
a
happier
flora
blow
hold
up
the
glass
my
desires
behold
them
through
my
soul
a
glass
at
memory
touch
the
withered
grass
breaks
forth
into
devouring
fires
now
above
my
thoughts
i
hold
the
azure
crystal
in
whose
heart
suddenly
unfolding
start
the
leaves
of
agonies
borne
of
old
until
those
nights
remote
i
see
even
to
memory
dead
so
long
that
their
sullen
tears
do
wrong
to
the
green
soul
of
hopes
to
be
reflections
under
the
brimming
tide
of
dreams
o
my
soul
is
full
of
fear
in
my
heart
the
moon
is
clear
deep
it
lies
in
the
tide
of
dreams
under
the
listless
reeds
asleep
only
the
deep
reflection
shows
of
palm
of
lily
and
of
rose
weeping
yet
in
the
waters
deep
and
the
flowers
late
and
soon
fall
upon
the
mirrored
sky
to
sink
and
sink
eternally
thro
dreamy
waters
and
the
moon
visions
all
the
tears
that
i
have
shed
all
my
kisses
lo
they
pass
thro
my
mind
as
in
a
glass
all
my
kisses
whose
joy
is
dead
there
are
flowers
without
a
hue
lilies
that
under
the
moonlight
fade
moonlight
over
the
meadows
laid
fountains
far
on
the
blue
weary
and
heavy
with
slumber
i
see
thro
the
lids
that
slumber
closes
crows
that
gather
amid
the
roses
sick
folk
under
a
sunbright
sky
of
these
vague
loves
the
weary
smart
shines
unchanging
late
and
soon
like
a
pale
moon
sadly
into
my
indolent
heart
prayer
thou
o
lord
my
spirit
dearth
thou
the
worth
of
what
i
bring
the
evil
blossoms
of
the
earth
the
light
upon
a
perished
thing
thou
my
sick
and
weary
mood
the
moon
is
dark
the
dawn
is
slain
thy
glory
on
my
solitude
shed
thou
like
fructifying
rain
light
thou
o
lord
beneath
my
feet
the
way
my
weary
soul
should
pass
for
now
the
pain
of
all
things
sweet
is
piteous
as
the
grass
glances
o
all
these
poor
weary
glances
and
yours
and
mine
and
those
that
are
no
more
and
those
to
be
and
those
that
will
never
be
and
yet
exist
there
are
those
that
seem
to
visit
the
poor
on
a
sabbath
there
are
some
like
sick
folk
who
are
houseless
there
are
some
like
lambs
in
a
meadow
full
of
bleaching
linen
and
o
these
strange
unwonted
glances
under
the
vaults
of
some
we
behold
a
maiden
being
put
to
death
in
a
chamber
with
closed
doors
and
some
make
us
dream
of
unknown
sorrows
of
peasants
at
the
windows
of
a
factory
of
a
gardener
turned
weaver
of
a
summer
afternoon
in
a
show
of
the
thoughts
of
a
queen
on
beholding
sick
man
in
a
garden
of
an
odour
of
camphor
in
the
forest
of
a
princess
locked
in
a
tower
on
a
day
of
rejoicing
of
men
sailing
all
the
week
on
the
stagnant
waters
of
a
canal
have
pity
on
those
that
come
creeping
forth
like
convalescents
at
have
pity
on
those
that
have
the
air
of
children
who
have
lost
their
way
at
have
pity
on
the
glances
of
the
wounded
man
at
the
surgeon
like
tents
stricken
by
a
hurricane
have
pity
on
the
glances
of
the
virgin
tempted
rivers
of
milk
are
flowing
away
in
the
darkness
and
the
swans
have
died
in
the
midst
of
serpents
and
the
gaze
of
the
virgin
who
surrenders
there
are
princesses
deserted
in
swamps
that
have
no
issue
and
lo
those
eyes
in
which
you
may
see
ships
in
full
sail
lit
up
by
flashes
of
the
storm
and
how
pitiful
are
all
those
glances
which
suffer
because
they
are
not
elsewhere
and
so
much
suffering
so
indistinguishable
and
yet
so
various
and
those
glances
which
no
one
will
ever
understand
and
those
poor
glances
which
are
all
but
dumb
and
those
poor
whispering
glances
and
those
poor
stifled
glances
amid
some
of
these
you
might
think
yourself
in
a
mansion
serving
as
hospital
and
many
others
have
the
air
of
tents
lilies
of
war
on
the
little
lawn
of
the
convent
and
many
others
have
the
air
of
wounded
men
tended
in
a
or
sisters
of
charity
on
an
ocean
devoid
of
patients
oh
to
have
encountered
all
these
glances
to
have
admitted
them
all
and
to
have
exhausted
mine
thereby
and
henceforth
to
be
unable
to
close
mine
eyes
vigil
my
soul
her
unused
hands
to
pray
folds
that
hide
the
world
away
lord
my
broken
dreams
complete
that
thine
angels
lips
repeat
while
beneath
my
wearied
eyes
she
breathes
the
prayers
that
in
her
rise
prayers
that
find
my
lids
a
tomb
and
whose
lilies
may
not
bloom
while
in
dreams
her
barren
breast
hushes
my
gaze
to
rest
still
her
eyes
from
perils
cower
such
as
wake
by
falsehood
power
afternoon
mine
eyes
have
snared
my
soul
but
o
grant
me
o
lord
my
one
desire
let
fall
thy
leaves
upon
the
snow
let
fall
thy
rain
upon
the
fire
the
sun
upon
my
pillow
plays
the
hours
they
sound
again
and
always
falls
my
questing
gaze
on
dying
men
that
harvest
grain
my
hands
they
pluck
the
withered
grass
mine
eyes
with
sleep
are
all
undone
are
sick
folk
in
a
springless
pass
or
flowers
of
darkness
in
the
sun
when
will
my
dreams
unchanging
know
the
rain
and
when
the
meadows
brown
along
the
far
horizon
lo
the
lambs
are
herded
toward
the
town
the
soul
dreams
within
mine
eyes
remain
and
beneath
its
crystal
dome
lights
my
soul
it
somewhile
home
taps
upon
the
azure
pane
houses
of
the
listless
soul
up
the
panes
the
lilies
creep
reeds
unfold
in
waters
deep
longings
nought
shall
make
whole
closing
eyes
it
all
but
seems
past
oblivion
i
could
hold
all
the
rosy
flowers
of
old
of
my
dreams
their
leaves
are
dead
and
scattered
far
shall
i
not
see
them
verdant
soon
when
with
her
azure
hands
the
moon
in
silence
sets
the
gates
ajar
intentions
have
pity
on
the
eyes
morose
wherein
the
soul
its
hope
reveals
on
fated
things
that
unclose
and
all
that
wait
what
night
conceals
ripples
that
rock
the
spirit
lake
lilies
that
sway
beneath
the
tide
to
threads
the
eternal
rhythms
shake
o
powers
that
close
to
vision
hide
behold
o
lord
unwonted
flowers
among
the
white
dim
hands
of
thine
angelic
powers
trouble
the
waters
of
my
sight
at
mystic
signs
the
buds
unroll
shed
on
the
waters
from
the
skies
and
as
the
swans
take
flight
my
soul
spreads
the
white
pinions
of
its
eyes
contacts
the
sense
of
contact
darkness
lies
between
your
fingers
the
cries
of
brazen
instruments
in
a
tempest
the
music
of
organs
in
the
sunlight
all
the
flocks
of
the
soul
in
the
depths
of
a
night
of
eclipse
all
the
salt
of
the
sea
on
the
grass
of
the
meadows
and
the
blaze
of
blue
lightning
on
every
horizon
have
pity
on
this
human
sense
but
o
these
sadder
wearier
contacts
o
the
touch
of
your
poor
moist
hands
i
hear
your
pure
fingers
as
they
glide
between
mine
and
flocks
of
lambs
are
departing
by
moonlight
along
the
banks
of
a
misty
river
i
can
remember
all
the
hands
that
have
touched
my
hands
and
again
i
see
all
that
was
protected
by
those
hands
and
i
see
what
i
was
protected
by
those
cool
hands
i
was
often
the
beggar
who
gnaws
his
crust
on
the
steps
of
a
throne
i
was
sometimes
the
diver
who
can
not
evade
the
surging
waters
i
was
often
a
whole
people
no
longer
able
to
escape
from
the
town
and
some
hands
were
like
a
convent
without
a
garden
and
some
confined
me
like
a
group
of
invalids
in
a
on
a
rainy
day
until
other
cooler
hands
should
come
to
set
the
doors
ajar
and
sprinkle
a
little
water
upon
the
threshold
o
i
have
known
strange
contacts
and
here
they
surround
me
forever
some
were
wont
to
give
alms
on
a
day
of
some
gathered
a
harvest
in
the
depths
of
a
cavern
and
the
music
of
mountebanks
was
heard
outside
the
prison
there
were
figures
in
the
summer
woods
and
elsewhere
the
moon
had
swept
the
whole
oasis
and
at
times
i
found
a
virgin
flushed
and
sweating
in
a
grotto
of
ice
pity
these
strange
hands
these
hands
contain
the
secrets
of
all
the
kings
pity
these
hands
too
pale
they
seem
to
have
emerged
from
the
caverns
of
the
moon
they
are
worn
with
spinning
threads
from
the
distaffs
of
fountains
pity
these
hands
too
white
too
moist
they
are
like
princesses
that
slumber
at
noon
all
the
summer
through
avoid
these
hard
harsh
hands
they
seem
to
have
issued
from
the
rocks
but
pity
these
cold
hands
i
see
a
heart
bleeding
under
ribs
of
ice
and
pity
these
evil
hands
for
these
have
poisoned
the
springs
they
have
set
young
cygnets
in
a
nest
of
hemlock
i
have
seen
the
angels
of
evil
open
the
gates
at
noon
here
are
only
madmen
on
a
pestilent
river
here
are
black
sheep
only
in
starless
pastures
and
lambs
hasting
away
to
graze
in
darkness
but
o
these
cool
faithful
hands
they
come
to
offer
ripe
fruits
to
the
dying
they
bring
clear
cold
water
in
their
palms
they
water
the
battlefields
with
milk
they
have
surely
come
from
wonderful
and
eternally
virgin
forests
night
my
soul
is
sick
at
the
end
of
all
sick
and
sad
being
weary
too
weary
of
being
so
vain
so
vain
weary
and
sad
at
the
end
of
all
and
o
i
long
for
the
touch
of
you
i
long
for
your
hands
upon
my
face
as
spirits
they
will
be
i
wait
until
they
bring
the
ring
i
wait
for
their
coolness
over
my
face
like
a
treasure
deep
in
the
sea
i
wait
to
know
their
healing
spell
lest
in
the
desolate
sun
i
die
so
that
i
die
not
out
in
the
sun
o
bathe
mine
eyes
and
make
them
well
where
things
unhappy
slumbering
lie
where
many
swans
upon
the
sea
swans
that
wander
over
the
sea
stretch
forth
their
mournful
throats
in
vain
in
wintry
gardens
by
the
sea
sick
men
pluck
roses
in
their
pain
i
long
for
your
hands
upon
my
face
as
spirits
they
will
be
and
soothe
my
aching
sight
alas
my
vision
like
the
withered
grass
where
listless
lambs
irresolute
pass
fifteen
songs

a
mystic
sign

gushes
gold

of

any

might

he
be
in
pain
if
he
ask
where
you
are
gone

him

my
golden

him

smouldered
lamp

the

in
sister
beatrice
i
hold
to
every
sin
to
every
soul
that
weeps
my
hands
with
pardon
filled
out
of
the
starry
deeps
there
is
no
sin
that
lives
when
love
hath
vigil
kept
there
is
no
soul
that
mourns
when
love
but
once
hath
wept
and
tho
on
many
paths
of
earth
love
lose
its
way
its
tears
will
find
me
out
and
shall
not
go
astray
