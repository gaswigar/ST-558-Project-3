the

bringing

and
turning
history
into
incredible
myth
in
a
single
generation
pa
had
sent
me
out
to
get
an
extra
pail
of
air
i
just
about
scooped
it
full
and
most
of
the
warmth
had
leaked
from
my
fingers
when
i
saw
the
thing
you
know
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
young
lady
yes
a
beautiful
young
lady
face
all
glowing
in
the
dark
and
looking
at
me
from
the
fifth
floor
of
the
opposite
apartment
which
hereabouts
is
the
floor
just
above
the
white
blanket
of
frozen
air
i
never
seen
a
live
young
lady
before
except
in
the
old
magazines
sis
is
just
a
kid
and
ma
is
pretty
sick
and
miserable
and
it
gave
me
such
a
start
that
i
dropped
the
pail
who
would
knowing
everyone
on
earth
was
dead
except
pa
and
ma
and
sis
and
you
even
at
that
i
do
suppose
i
should
have
been
surprised
we
all
see
things
now
and
then
ma
has
some
pretty
bad
ones
to
judge
from
the
way
she
bugs
her
eyes
at
nothing
and
just
screams
and
screams
and
huddles
back
against
the
blankets
hanging
around
the
nest
pa
says
it
is
natural
we
should
react
like
that
sometimes
when
i
recovered
the
pail
and
could
look
again
at
the
opposite
apartment
i
got
an
idea
of
what
ma
might
be
feeling
at
those
times
for
i
saw
it
was
a
young
lady
at
all
but
simply
a
light
a
tiny
light
that
moved
stealthily
from
window
to
window
just
as
if
one
of
the
cruel
little
stars
had
come
down
out
of
the
airless
sky
to
investigate
why
the
earth
had
gone
away
from
the
sun
and
maybe
to
hunt
down
something
to
torment
or
terrify
now
that
the
earth
did
have
the
sun
protection
i
tell
you
the
thought
of
it
gave
me
the
creeps
i
just
stood
there
shaking
and
almost
froze
my
feet
and
did
frost
my
helmet
so
solid
on
the
inside
that
i
could
have
seen
the
light
even
if
it
had
come
out
of
one
of
the
windows
to
get
me
then
i
had
the
wit
to
go
back
inside
pretty
soon
i
was
feeling
my
familiar
way
through
the
thirty
or
so
blankets
and
rugs
pa
has
got
hung
around
to
slow
down
the
escape
of
air
from
the
nest
and
i
was
quite
so
scared
i
began
to
hear
the
of
the
clocks
in
the
nest
and
knew
i
was
getting
back
into
air
because
there
no
sound
outside
in
the
vacuum
of
course
but
my
mind
was
still
crawly
and
uneasy
as
i
pushed
through
the
last
blankets
pa
got
them
faced
with
aluminum
foil
to
hold
in
the
heat
and
came
into
the
nest
let
me
tell
you
about
the
nest
it
low
and
snug
just
room
for
the
four
of
us
and
our
things
the
floor
is
covered
with
thick
woolly
rugs
three
of
the
sides
are
blankets
and
the
blankets
roofing
it
touch
pa
head
he
tells
me
it
inside
a
much
bigger
room
but
never
seen
the
real
walls
or
ceiling
against
one
of
the
is
a
big
set
of
shelves
with
tools
and
books
and
other
stuff
and
on
top
of
it
a
whole
row
of
clocks
very
fussy
about
keeping
them
wound
he
says
we
must
never
forget
time
and
without
a
sun
or
moon
that
would
be
easy
to
do
the
fourth
wall
has
blankets
all
over
except
around
the
fireplace
in
which
there
is
a
fire
that
must
never
go
out
it
keeps
us
from
freezing
and
does
a
lot
more
besides
one
of
us
must
always
watch
it
some
of
the
clocks
are
alarm
and
we
can
use
them
to
remind
us
in
the
early
days
there
was
only
ma
to
take
turns
with
pa
i
think
of
that
when
she
gets
difficult
but
now
there
me
to
help
and
sis
too
it
pa
who
is
the
chief
guardian
of
the
fire
though
i
always
think
of
him
that
way
a
tall
man
sitting
frowning
anxiously
at
the
fire
his
lined
face
golden
in
its
light
and
every
so
often
carefully
placing
on
it
a
piece
of
coal
from
the
big
heap
beside
it
pa
tells
me
there
used
to
be
guardians
of
the
fire
sometimes
in
the
very
old
days
vestal
virgins
he
calls
them
although
there
was
unfrozen
air
all
around
then
and
you
did
really
need
one
he
was
sitting
just
that
way
now
though
he
got
up
quick
to
take
the
pail
from
me
and
bawl
me
out
for
loitering
he
spotted
my
frozen
helmet
right
off
that
roused
ma
and
she
joined
in
picking
on
me
always
trying
to
get
the
load
off
her
feelings
pa
explains
he
shut
her
up
pretty
fast
sis
let
off
a
couple
of
silly
squeals
too
pa
handled
the
pail
of
air
in
a
twist
of
cloth
now
that
it
was
inside
the
nest
you
could
really
feel
its
coldness
it
just
seemed
to
suck
the
heat
out
of
everything
even
the
flames
cringed
away
from
it
as
pa
put
it
down
close
by
the
fire
yet
it
that
glimmery
white
stuff
in
the
pail
that
keeps
us
alive
it
slowly
melts
and
vanishes
and
refreshes
the
nest
and
feeds
the
fire
the
blankets
keep
it
from
escaping
too
fast
pa
like
to
seal
the
whole
place
but
he
ca
building
too
and
besides
he
has
to
leave
the
chimney
open
for
smoke
pa
says
air
is
tiny
molecules
that
fly
away
like
a
flash
if
there
something
to
stop
them
we
have
to
watch
sharp
not
to
let
the
air
run
low
pa
always
keeps
a
big
reserve
supply
of
it
in
buckets
behind
the
first
blankets
along
with
extra
coal
and
cans
of
food
and
other
things
such
as
pails
of
snow
to
melt
for
water
we
have
to
go
way
down
to
the
bottom
floor
for
that
stuff
which
is
a
mean
trip
and
get
it
through
a
door
to
outside
you
see
when
the
earth
got
cold
all
the
water
in
the
air
froze
first
and
made
a
blanket
ten
feet
thick
or
so
everywhere
and
then
down
on
top
of
that
dropped
the
crystals
of
frozen
air
making
another
white
blanket
sixty
or
seventy
feet
thick
maybe
of
course
all
the
parts
of
the
air
did
freeze
and
snow
down
at
the
same
time
first
to
drop
out
was
the
carbon
dioxide
when
you
shoveling
for
water
you
have
to
make
sure
you
do
go
too
high
and
get
any
of
that
stuff
mixed
in
for
it
would
put
you
to
sleep
maybe
for
good
and
make
the
fire
go
out
next
there
the
nitrogen
which
does
count
one
way
or
the
other
though
it
the
biggest
part
of
the
blanket
on
top
of
that
and
easy
to
get
at
which
is
lucky
for
us
there
the
oxygen
that
keeps
us
alive
pa
says
we
live
better
than
kings
ever
did
breathing
pure
oxygen
but
we
used
to
it
and
do
notice
finally
at
the
very
top
there
a
slick
of
liquid
helium
which
is
funny
stuff
all
of
these
gases
in
neat
separate
layers
like
a
pussy
caffay
pa
laughingly
says
whatever
that
is
i
was
busting
to
tell
them
all
about
what
i
seen
and
so
as
soon
as
i
ducked
out
of
my
helmet
and
while
i
was
still
climbing
out
of
my
suit
i
cut
loose
right
away
ma
got
nervous
and
began
making
eyes
at
the
in
the
blankets
and
wringing
her
hands
together
the
hand
where
she
lost
three
fingers
from
frostbite
inside
the
good
one
as
usual
i
could
tell
that
pa
was
annoyed
at
me
scaring
her
and
wanted
to
explain
it
all
away
quickly
yet
could
see
i
was
fooling
and
you
watched
this
light
for
some
time
son
he
asked
when
i
finished
i
had
said
anything
about
first
thinking
it
was
a
young
lady
face
somehow
that
part
embarrassed
me
long
enough
for
it
to
pass
five
windows
and
go
to
the
next
floor
and
it
did
look
like
stray
electricity
or
crawling
liquid
or
starlight
focused
by
a
growing
crystal
or
anything
like
that
he
was
just
making
up
those
ideas
odd
things
happen
in
a
world
that
about
as
cold
as
can
be
and
just
when
you
think
matter
would
be
frozen
dead
it
takes
on
a
strange
new
life
a
slimy
stuff
comes
crawling
toward
the
nest
just
like
an
animal
snuffing
for
heat
that
the
liquid
helium
and
once
when
i
was
little
a
bolt
of
lightning
not
even
pa
could
figure
where
it
came
from
hit
the
nearby
steeple
and
crawled
up
and
down
it
for
weeks
until
the
glow
finally
died
not
like
anything
i
ever
saw
i
told
him
he
stood
for
a
moment
frowning
then
i
go
out
with
you
and
you
show
it
to
me
he
said
ma
raised
a
howl
at
the
idea
of
being
left
alone
and
sis
joined
in
too
but
pa
quieted
them
we
started
climbing
into
our
outside
clothes
mine
had
been
warming
by
the
fire
pa
made
them
they
have
plastic
headpieces
that
were
once
big
transparent
food
cans
but
they
keep
heat
and
air
in
and
can
replace
the
air
for
a
little
while
long
enough
for
our
trips
for
water
and
coal
and
food
and
so
on
ma
started
moaning
again
i
always
known
there
was
something
outside
there
waiting
to
get
us
i
felt
it
for
years
something
that
part
of
the
cold
and
hates
all
warmth
and
wants
to
destroy
the
nest
it
been
watching
us
all
this
time
and
now
it
coming
after
us
it
get
you
and
then
come
for
me
do
go
harry
pa
had
everything
on
but
his
helmet
he
knelt
by
the
fireplace
and
reached
in
and
shook
the
long
metal
rod
that
goes
up
the
chimney
and
knocks
off
the
ice
that
keeps
trying
to
clog
it
once
a
week
he
goes
up
on
the
roof
to
check
if
it
working
all
right
that
our
worst
trip
and
pa
wo
let
me
make
it
alone
sis
pa
said
quietly
come
watch
the
fire
keep
an
eye
on
the
air
too
if
it
gets
low
or
does
seem
to
be
boiling
fast
enough
fetch
another
bucket
from
behind
the
blanket
but
mind
your
hands
use
the
cloth
to
pick
up
the
bucket
sis
quit
helping
ma
be
frightened
and
came
over
and
did
as
she
was
told
ma
quieted
down
pretty
suddenly
though
her
eyes
were
still
kind
of
wild
as
she
watched
pa
fix
on
his
helmet
tight
and
pick
up
a
pail
and
the
two
of
us
go
out
pa
led
the
way
and
i
took
hold
of
his
belt
it
a
funny
thing
i
not
afraid
to
go
by
myself
but
when
pa
along
i
always
want
to
hold
on
to
him
habit
i
guess
and
then
there
no
denying
that
this
time
i
was
a
bit
scared
you
see
it
this
way
we
know
that
everything
is
dead
out
there
pa
heard
the
last
radio
voices
fade
away
years
ago
and
had
seen
some
of
the
last
folks
die
who
were
as
lucky
or
as
us
so
we
knew
that
if
there
was
something
groping
around
out
there
it
be
anything
human
or
friendly
besides
that
there
a
feeling
that
comes
with
it
always
being
night
night
pa
says
there
used
to
be
some
of
that
feeling
even
in
the
old
days
but
then
every
morning
the
sun
would
come
and
chase
it
away
i
have
to
take
his
word
for
that
not
ever
remembering
the
sun
as
being
anything
more
than
a
big
star
you
see
i
had
been
born
when
the
dark
star
snatched
us
away
from
the
sun
and
by
now
it
dragged
us
out
beyond
the
orbit
of
the
planet
pluto
pa
says
and
taking
us
farther
out
all
the
time
i
found
myself
wondering
whether
there
might
be
something
on
the
dark
star
that
wanted
us
and
if
that
was
why
it
had
captured
the
earth
just
then
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
i
followed
pa
out
on
the
balcony
i
do
know
what
the
city
looked
like
in
the
old
days
but
now
beautiful
the
starlight
lets
you
see
it
pretty
well
there
quite
a
bit
of
light
in
those
steady
points
speckling
the
blackness
above
pa
says
the
stars
used
to
twinkle
once
but
that
was
because
there
was
air
we
are
on
a
hill
and
the
shimmery
plain
drops
away
from
us
and
then
flattens
out
cut
up
into
neat
squares
by
the
troughs
that
used
to
be
streets
i
sometimes
make
my
mashed
potatoes
look
like
it
before
i
pour
on
the
gravy
some
taller
buildings
push
up
out
of
the
feathery
plain
topped
by
rounded
caps
of
air
crystals
like
the
fur
hood
ma
wears
only
whiter
on
those
buildings
you
can
see
the
darker
squares
of
windows
underlined
by
white
dashes
of
air
crystals
some
of
them
are
on
a
slant
for
many
of
the
buildings
are
pretty
badly
twisted
by
the
quakes
and
all
the
rest
that
happened
when
the
dark
star
captured
the
earth
here
and
there
a
few
icicles
hang
water
icicles
from
the
first
days
of
the
cold
other
icicles
of
frozen
air
that
melted
on
the
roofs
and
dripped
and
froze
again
sometimes
one
of
those
icicles
will
catch
the
light
of
a
star
and
send
it
to
you
so
brightly
you
think
the
star
has
swooped
into
the
city
that
was
one
of
the
things
pa
had
been
thinking
of
when
i
told
him
about
the
light
but
i
had
thought
of
it
myself
first
and
known
it
was
so
he
touched
his
helmet
to
mine
so
we
could
talk
easier
and
he
asked
me
to
point
out
the
windows
to
him
but
there
was
any
light
moving
around
inside
them
now
or
anywhere
else
to
my
surprise
pa
bawl
me
out
and
tell
me
i
been
seeing
things
he
looked
all
around
quite
a
while
after
filling
his
pail
and
just
as
we
were
going
inside
he
whipped
around
without
warning
as
if
to
take
some
peeping
thing
off
guard
i
could
feel
it
too
the
old
peace
was
gone
there
was
something
lurking
out
there
watching
waiting
getting
ready
inside
he
said
to
me
touching
helmets
if
you
see
something
like
that
again
son
do
tell
the
others
your
ma
sort
of
nervous
these
days
and
we
owe
her
all
the
feeling
of
safety
we
can
give
her
once
it
was
when
your
sister
was
born
i
was
ready
to
give
up
and
die
but
your
mother
kept
me
trying
another
time
she
kept
the
fire
going
a
whole
week
all
by
herself
when
i
was
sick
nursed
me
and
took
care
of
the
two
of
you
too
you
know
that
game
we
sometimes
play
sitting
in
a
square
in
the
nest
tossing
a
ball
around
courage
is
like
a
ball
son
a
person
can
hold
it
only
so
long
and
then
he
got
to
toss
it
to
someone
else
when
it
tossed
your
way
you
got
to
catch
it
and
hold
it
tight
and
hope
there
be
someone
else
to
toss
it
to
when
you
get
tired
of
being
brave
his
talking
to
me
that
way
made
me
feel
and
good
but
it
did
wipe
away
the
thing
outside
from
the
back
of
my
mind
or
the
fact
that
pa
took
it
seriously
it
hard
to
hide
your
feelings
about
such
a
thing
when
we
got
back
in
the
nest
and
took
off
our
outside
clothes
pa
laughed
about
it
all
and
told
them
it
was
nothing
and
kidded
me
for
having
such
an
imagination
but
his
words
fell
flat
he
did
convince
ma
and
sis
any
more
than
he
did
me
it
looked
for
a
minute
like
we
were
all
fumbling
the
something
had
to
be
done
and
almost
before
i
knew
what
i
was
going
to
say
i
heard
myself
asking
pa
to
tell
us
about
the
old
days
and
how
it
all
happened
he
sometimes
does
mind
telling
that
story
and
sis
and
i
sure
like
to
listen
to
it
and
he
got
my
idea
so
we
were
all
settled
around
the
fire
in
a
wink
and
ma
pushed
up
some
cans
to
thaw
for
supper
and
pa
began
before
he
did
though
i
noticed
him
casually
get
a
hammer
from
the
shelf
and
lay
it
down
beside
him
it
was
the
same
old
story
as
always
i
think
i
could
recite
the
main
thread
of
it
in
my
sleep
though
pa
always
puts
in
a
new
detail
or
two
and
keeps
improving
it
in
spots
he
told
us
how
the
earth
had
been
swinging
around
the
sun
ever
so
steady
and
warm
and
the
people
on
it
fixing
to
make
money
and
wars
and
have
a
good
time
and
get
power
and
treat
each
other
right
or
wrong
when
without
warning
there
comes
charging
out
of
space
this
dead
star
this
burned
out
sun
and
upsets
everything
you
know
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
in
the
way
those
people
felt
any
more
than
i
can
believe
in
the
swarming
number
of
them
imagine
people
getting
ready
for
the
horrible
sort
of
war
they
were
cooking
up
wanting
it
even
or
at
least
wishing
it
were
over
so
as
to
end
their
nervousness
as
if
all
folks
did
have
to
hang
together
and
pool
every
bit
of
warmth
just
to
keep
alive
and
how
can
they
have
hoped
to
end
danger
any
more
than
we
can
hope
to
end
the
cold
sometimes
i
think
pa
exaggerates
and
makes
things
out
too
black
cross
with
us
once
in
a
while
and
was
probably
cross
with
all
those
folks
still
some
of
the
things
i
read
in
the
old
magazines
sound
pretty
wild
he
may
be
right
the
dark
star
as
pa
went
on
telling
it
rushed
in
pretty
fast
and
there
was
much
time
to
get
ready
at
the
beginning
they
tried
to
keep
it
a
secret
from
most
people
but
then
the
truth
came
out
what
with
the
earthquakes
and
floods
imagine
oceans
of
water
and
people
seeing
stars
blotted
out
by
something
on
a
clear
night
first
off
they
thought
it
would
hit
the
sun
and
then
they
thought
it
would
hit
the
earth
there
was
even
the
start
of
a
rush
to
get
to
a
place
called
china
because
people
thought
the
star
would
hit
on
the
other
side
but
then
they
found
it
was
going
to
hit
either
side
but
was
going
to
come
very
close
to
the
earth
most
of
the
other
planets
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
sun
and
get
involved
the
sun
and
the
newcomer
fought
over
the
earth
for
a
little
while
pulling
it
this
way
and
that
like
two
dogs
growling
over
a
bone
pa
described
it
this
time
and
then
the
newcomer
won
and
carried
us
off
the
sun
got
a
consolation
prize
though
at
the
last
minute
he
managed
to
hold
on
to
the
moon
that
was
the
time
of
the
monster
earthquakes
and
floods
twenty
times
worse
than
anything
before
it
was
also
the
time
of
the
big
jerk
as
pa
calls
it
when
all
earth
got
yanked
suddenly
just
as
pa
has
done
to
me
once
or
twice
grabbing
me
by
the
collar
to
do
it
when
i
been
sitting
too
far
from
the
fire
you
see
the
dark
star
was
going
through
space
faster
than
the
sun
and
in
the
opposite
direction
and
it
had
to
wrench
the
world
considerably
in
order
to
take
it
away
the
big
jerk
did
last
long
it
was
over
as
soon
as
the
earth
was
settled
down
in
its
new
orbit
around
the
dark
star
but
it
was
pretty
terrible
while
it
lasted
pa
says
that
all
sorts
of
cliffs
and
buildings
toppled
oceans
slopped
over
swamps
and
sandy
deserts
gave
great
sliding
surges
that
buried
nearby
lands
earth
was
almost
jerked
out
of
its
atmosphere
blanket
and
the
air
got
so
thin
in
spots
that
people
keeled
over
and
fainted
though
of
course
at
the
same
time
they
were
getting
knocked
down
by
the
big
jerk
and
maybe
their
bones
broke
or
skulls
cracked
we
often
asked
pa
how
people
acted
during
that
time
whether
they
were
scared
or
brave
or
crazy
or
stunned
or
all
four
but
he
sort
of
leery
of
the
subject
and
he
was
again
tonight
he
says
he
was
mostly
too
busy
to
notice
you
see
pa
and
some
scientist
friends
of
his
had
figured
out
part
of
what
was
going
to
happen
they
known
we
get
captured
and
our
air
would
freeze
and
they
been
working
like
mad
to
fix
up
a
place
with
airtight
walls
and
doors
and
insulation
against
the
cold
and
big
supplies
of
food
and
fuel
and
water
and
bottled
air
but
the
place
got
smashed
in
the
last
earthquakes
and
all
pa
friends
were
killed
then
and
in
the
big
jerk
so
he
had
to
start
over
and
throw
the
nest
together
quick
without
any
advantages
just
using
any
stuff
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
i
guess
he
telling
pretty
much
the
truth
when
he
says
he
did
have
any
time
to
keep
an
eye
on
how
other
folks
behaved
either
then
or
in
the
big
freeze
that
followed
followed
very
quick
you
know
both
because
the
dark
star
was
pulling
us
away
very
fast
and
because
rotation
had
been
slowed
in
the
so
that
the
nights
were
ten
old
nights
long
still
i
got
an
idea
of
some
of
the
things
that
happened
from
the
frozen
folk
i
seen
a
few
of
them
in
other
rooms
in
our
building
others
clustered
around
the
furnaces
in
the
basements
where
we
go
for
coal
in
one
of
the
rooms
an
old
man
sits
stiff
in
a
chair
with
an
arm
and
a
leg
in
splints
in
another
a
man
and
woman
are
huddled
together
in
a
bed
with
heaps
of
covers
over
them
you
can
just
see
their
heads
peeking
out
close
together
and
in
another
a
beautiful
young
lady
is
sitting
with
a
pile
of
wraps
huddled
around
her
looking
hopefully
toward
the
door
as
if
waiting
for
someone
who
never
came
back
with
warmth
and
food
they
all
still
and
stiff
as
statues
of
course
but
just
like
life
pa
showed
them
to
me
once
in
quick
winks
of
his
flashlight
when
he
still
had
a
fair
supply
of
batteries
and
could
afford
to
waste
a
little
light
they
scared
me
pretty
bad
and
made
my
heart
pound
especially
the
young
lady
now
with
pa
telling
his
story
for
the
umpteenth
time
to
take
our
minds
off
another
scare
i
got
to
thinking
of
the
frozen
folk
again
all
of
a
sudden
i
got
an
idea
that
scared
me
worse
than
anything
yet
you
see
i
just
remembered
the
face
i
thought
i
seen
in
the
window
forgotten
about
that
on
account
of
trying
to
hide
it
from
the
others
what
i
asked
myself
if
the
frozen
folk
were
coming
to
life
what
if
they
were
like
the
liquid
helium
that
got
a
new
lease
on
life
and
started
crawling
toward
the
heat
just
when
you
thought
its
molecules
ought
to
freeze
solid
forever
or
like
the
electricity
that
moves
endlessly
when
it
just
about
as
cold
as
that
what
if
the
cold
with
the
temperature
creeping
down
the
last
few
degrees
to
the
last
zero
had
mysteriously
wakened
the
frozen
folk
to
life
not
life
but
something
icy
and
horrible
that
was
a
worse
idea
than
the
one
about
something
coming
down
from
the
dark
star
to
get
us
or
maybe
i
thought
both
ideas
might
be
true
something
coming
down
from
the
dark
star
and
making
the
frozen
folk
move
using
them
to
do
its
work
that
would
fit
with
both
things
i
seen
the
beautiful
young
lady
and
the
moving
starlike
light
the
frozen
folk
with
minds
from
the
dark
star
behind
their
unwinking
eyes
creeping
crawling
snuffing
their
way
following
the
heat
to
the
nest
i
tell
you
that
thought
gave
me
a
very
bad
turn
and
i
wanted
very
badly
to
tell
the
others
my
fears
but
i
remembered
what
pa
had
said
and
clenched
my
teeth
and
did
speak
we
were
all
sitting
very
still
even
the
fire
was
burning
silently
there
was
just
the
sound
of
pa
voice
and
the
clocks
and
then
from
beyond
the
blankets
i
thought
i
heard
a
tiny
noise
my
skin
tightened
all
over
me
pa
was
telling
about
the
early
years
in
the
nest
and
had
come
to
the
place
where
he
philosophizes
so
i
asked
myself
then
he
said
what
the
use
of
going
on
the
use
of
dragging
it
out
for
a
few
years
why
prolong
a
doomed
existence
of
hard
work
and
cold
and
loneliness
the
human
race
is
done
the
earth
is
done
why
not
give
up
i
asked
myself
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
got
the
answer
again
i
heard
the
noise
louder
this
time
a
kind
of
uncertain
shuffling
tread
coming
closer
i
could
breathe
life
always
been
a
business
of
working
hard
and
fighting
the
cold
pa
was
saying
the
earth
always
been
a
lonely
place
millions
of
miles
from
the
next
planet
and
no
matter
how
long
the
human
race
might
have
lived
the
end
would
have
come
some
night
those
things
matter
what
matters
is
that
life
is
good
it
has
a
lovely
texture
like
some
rich
cloth
or
fur
or
the
petals
of
flowers
you
seen
pictures
of
those
but
i
ca
describe
how
they
feel
or
the
glow
it
makes
everything
else
worth
while
and
that
as
true
for
the
last
man
as
the
first
and
still
the
steps
kept
shuffling
closer
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
inmost
blanket
trembled
and
bulged
a
little
just
as
if
they
were
burned
into
my
imagination
i
kept
seeing
those
peering
frozen
eyes
so
right
then
and
there
pa
went
on
and
now
i
could
tell
that
he
heard
the
steps
too
and
was
talking
loud
so
we
maybe
would
hear
them
right
then
and
there
i
told
myself
that
i
was
going
on
as
if
we
had
all
eternity
ahead
of
us
i
have
children
and
teach
them
all
i
could
i
get
them
to
read
books
i
plan
for
the
future
try
to
enlarge
and
seal
the
nest
i
do
what
i
could
to
keep
everything
beautiful
and
growing
i
keep
alive
my
feeling
of
wonder
even
at
the
cold
and
the
dark
and
the
distant
stars
but
then
the
blanket
actually
did
move
and
lift
and
there
was
a
bright
light
somewhere
behind
it
pa
voice
stopped
and
his
eyes
turned
to
the
widening
slit
and
his
hand
went
out
until
it
touched
and
gripped
the
handle
of
the
hammer
beside
him
in
through
the
blanket
stepped
the
beautiful
young
lady
she
stood
there
looking
at
us
the
strangest
way
and
she
carried
something
bright
and
unwinking
in
her
hand
and
two
other
faces
peered
over
her
shoulders
men
faces
white
and
staring
well
my
heart
could
have
been
stopped
for
more
than
four
or
five
beats
before
i
realized
she
was
wearing
a
suit
and
helmet
like
homemade
ones
only
fancier
and
that
the
men
were
too
and
that
the
frozen
folk
certainly
would
be
wearing
those
also
i
noticed
that
the
bright
thing
in
her
hand
was
just
a
kind
of
flashlight
the
silence
kept
on
while
i
swallowed
hard
a
couple
of
times
and
after
that
there
was
all
sorts
of
jabbering
and
commotion
they
were
simply
people
you
see
we
had
been
the
only
ones
to
survive
we
just
thought
so
for
natural
enough
reasons
these
three
people
had
survived
and
quite
a
few
others
with
them
and
when
we
found
out
they
survived
pa
let
out
the
biggest
whoop
of
joy
they
were
from
los
alamos
and
they
were
getting
their
heat
and
power
from
atomic
energy
just
using
the
uranium
and
plutonium
intended
for
bombs
they
had
enough
to
go
on
for
thousands
of
years
they
had
a
regular
little
airtight
city
with
and
all
they
even
generated
electric
light
and
grew
plants
and
animals
by
it
at
this
pa
let
out
a
second
whoop
waking
ma
from
her
faint
but
if
we
were
flabbergasted
at
them
they
were
at
us
one
of
the
men
kept
saying
but
it
impossible
i
tell
you
you
ca
maintain
an
air
supply
without
hermetic
sealing
it
simply
impossible
that
was
after
he
had
got
his
helmet
off
and
was
using
our
air
meanwhile
the
young
lady
kept
looking
around
at
us
as
if
we
were
saints
and
telling
us
we
done
something
amazing
and
suddenly
she
broke
down
and
cried
they
been
scouting
around
for
survivors
but
they
never
expected
to
find
any
in
a
place
like
this
they
had
rocket
ships
at
los
alamos
and
plenty
of
chemical
fuel
as
for
liquid
oxygen
all
you
had
to
do
was
go
out
and
shovel
the
air
blanket
at
the
top
so
after
got
things
going
smoothly
at
los
alamos
which
had
taken
years
decided
to
make
some
trips
to
likely
places
where
there
might
be
other
survivors
no
good
trying
radio
signals
of
course
since
there
was
no
atmosphere
to
carry
them
around
the
curve
of
the
earth
well
they
found
other
colonies
at
argonne
and
brookhaven
and
way
around
the
world
at
harwell
and
tanna
tuva
and
now
they
been
giving
our
city
a
look
not
really
expecting
to
find
anything
but
they
had
an
instrument
that
noticed
the
faintest
heat
waves
and
it
had
told
them
there
was
something
warm
down
here
so
they
landed
to
investigate
of
course
we
had
heard
them
land
since
there
was
no
air
to
carry
the
sound
and
they
had
to
investigate
around
quite
a
while
before
finding
us
their
instruments
had
given
them
a
wrong
steer
and
wasted
some
time
in
the
building
across
the
street
by
now
all
five
adults
were
talking
like
sixty
pa
was
demonstrating
to
the
men
how
he
worked
the
fire
and
got
rid
of
the
ice
in
the
chimney
and
all
that
ma
had
perked
up
wonderfully
and
was
showing
the
young
lady
her
cooking
and
sewing
stuff
and
even
asking
about
how
the
women
dressed
at
los
alamos
the
strangers
marveled
at
everything
and
praised
it
to
the
skies
i
could
tell
from
the
way
they
wrinkled
their
noses
that
they
found
the
nest
a
bit
smelly
but
they
never
mentioned
that
at
all
and
just
asked
bushels
of
questions
in
fact
there
was
so
much
talking
and
excitement
that
pa
forgot
about
things
and
it
was
until
they
were
all
getting
groggy
that
he
looked
and
found
the
air
had
all
boiled
away
in
the
pail
he
got
another
bucket
of
air
quick
from
behind
the
blankets
of
course
that
started
them
all
laughing
and
jabbering
again
the
newcomers
even
got
a
little
drunk
they
were
used
to
so
much
oxygen
funny
thing
though
i
did
do
much
talking
at
all
and
sis
hung
on
to
ma
all
the
time
and
hid
her
face
when
anybody
looked
at
her
i
felt
pretty
uncomfortable
and
disturbed
myself
even
about
the
young
lady
glimpsing
her
outside
there
i
had
all
sorts
of
mushy
thoughts
but
now
i
was
just
embarrassed
and
scared
of
her
even
though
she
tried
to
be
nice
as
anything
to
me
i
sort
of
wished
they
all
quit
crowding
the
nest
and
let
us
be
alone
and
get
our
feelings
straightened
out
and
when
the
newcomers
began
to
talk
about
our
all
going
to
los
alamos
as
if
that
were
taken
for
granted
i
could
see
that
something
of
the
same
feeling
struck
pa
and
ma
too
pa
got
very
silent
all
of
a
sudden
and
ma
kept
telling
the
young
lady
but
i
would
know
how
to
act
there
and
i
have
any
clothes
the
strangers
were
puzzled
like
anything
at
first
but
then
they
got
the
idea
as
pa
kept
saying
it
just
does
seem
right
to
let
this
fire
go
out
well
the
strangers
are
gone
but
they
coming
back
it
has
been
decided
yet
just
what
will
happen
maybe
the
nest
will
be
kept
up
as
what
one
of
the
strangers
called
a
survival
school
or
maybe
we
will
join
the
pioneers
who
are
going
to
try
to
establish
a
new
colony
at
the
uranium
mines
at
great
slave
lake
or
in
the
congo
of
course
now
that
the
strangers
are
gone
i
been
thinking
a
lot
about
los
alamos
and
those
other
tremendous
colonies
i
have
a
hankering
to
see
them
for
myself
you
ask
me
pa
wants
to
see
them
too
he
been
getting
pretty
thoughtful
watching
ma
and
sis
perk
up
it
different
now
that
we
know
others
are
alive
he
explains
to
me
your
mother
does
feel
so
hopeless
any
more
neither
do
i
for
that
matter
not
having
to
carry
the
whole
responsibility
for
keeping
the
human
race
going
so
to
speak
it
scares
a
person
i
looked
around
at
the
blanket
walls
and
the
fire
and
the
pails
of
air
boiling
away
and
ma
and
sis
sleeping
in
the
warmth
and
the
flickering
light
it
not
going
to
be
easy
to
leave
the
nest
i
said
wanting
to
cry
kind
of
it
so
small
and
there
just
the
four
of
us
i
get
scared
at
the
idea
of
big
places
and
a
lot
of
strangers
he
nodded
and
put
another
piece
of
coal
on
the
fire
then
he
looked
at
the
little
pile
and
grinned
suddenly
and
put
a
couple
of
handfuls
on
just
as
if
it
was
one
of
our
birthdays
or
christmas
you
quickly
get
over
that
feeling
son
he
said
the
trouble
with
the
world
was
that
it
kept
getting
smaller
and
smaller
till
it
ended
with
just
the
nest
now
it
be
good
to
have
a
real
huge
world
again
the
way
it
was
in
the
beginning
i
guess
he
right
you
think
the
beautiful
young
lady
will
wait
for
me
till
i
grow
up
i
be
twenty
in
only
ten
years
