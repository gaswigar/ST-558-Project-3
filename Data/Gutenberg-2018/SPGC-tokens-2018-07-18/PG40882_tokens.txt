felix

the
radical
introduction
years
ago
the
glory
had
not
yet
departed
from
the
old
coach
roads
the
great
roadside
inns
were
still
brilliant
with
tankards
the
smiling
glances
of
pretty
barmaids
and
the
repartees
of
jocose
hostlers
the
mail
still
announced
itself
by
the
merry
notes
of
the
horn
the
or
the
might
still
know
the
exact
hour
by
the
unfailing
yet
otherwise
meteoric
apparition
of
the
or
the
yellow
independent
and
elderly
gentlemen
in
quartering
nervously
to
make
way
for
the
rolling
swinging
swiftness
had
not
ceased
to
remark
that
times
were
finely
changed
since
they
used
to
see
the
and
hear
the
tinkling
of
their
bells
on
this
very
highway
in
those
days
there
were
pocket
boroughs
a
birmingham
unrepresented
in
parliament
and
compelled
to
make
strong
representations
out
of
it
unrepealed
letters
a
brawny
and
pauperism
and
other
departed
evils
but
there
were
some
pleasant
things
too
which
have
also
departed

says
the
wise
goddess
you
have
not
the
best
of
it
in
all
things
o
youngsters
the
elderly
man
has
his
enviable
memories
and
not
the
least
of
them
is
the
memory
of
a
long
journey
in
or
autumn
on
the
outside
of
a
stage
coach
posterity
may
be
shot
like
a
bullet
through
a
tube
by
atmospheric
pressure
from
winchester
to
newcastle
that
is
a
fine
result
to
have
among
our
hopes
but
the
slow
old
fashioned
way
of
getting
from
one
end
of
our
country
to
the
other
is
the
better
thing
to
have
in
the
memory
the
can
never
lend
much
to
picture
and
narrative
it
is
as
barren
as
an
exclamatory
o
whereas
the
happy
outside
passenger
seated
on
the
box
from
the
dawn
to
the
gloaming
gathered
enough
stories
of
english
life
enough
of
english
labors
in
town
and
country
enough
aspects
of
earth
and
sky
to
make
episodes
for
a
modern
odyssey
suppose
only
that
his
journey
took
him
through
that
central
plain
watered
at
one
extremity
by
the
avon
at
the
other
by
the
trent
as
the
morning
silvered
the
meadows
with
their
long
lines
of
bushy
willows
marking
the
or
burnished
the
golden
clustered
near
the
long
roofs
of
some
midland
homestead
he
saw
the
cows
driven
from
their
pasture
to
the
early
milking
perhaps
it
was
the
shepherd
of
the
farm
who
drove
them
his
following
with
a
heedless
unofficial
air
as
of
a
beadle
in
undress
the
shepherd
with
a
slow
and
slouching
walk
timed
by
the
walk
of
grazing
beasts
moved
aside
as
if
unwillingly
throwing
out
a
monosyllabic
hint
to
his
cattle
his
glance
accustomed
to
rest
on
things
very
near
the
earth
seemed
to
lift
itself
with
difficulty
to
the
coachman
mail
or
stage
coach
for
him
belonged
to
the
mysterious
distant
system
of
things
called
which
whatever
it
might
be
was
no
business
of
his
any
more
than
the
most
outlying
nebula
or
the
of
the
southern
hemisphere
his
solar
system
was
the
parish
the
master
temper
and
the
casualties
of
were
his
region
of
storms
he
cut
his
bread
and
bacon
with
his
and
felt
no
bitterness
except
in
the
matter
of
pauper
laborers
and
the
that
sent
contrarious
seasons
and
the
he
and
his
cows
were
soon
left
behind
and
the
homestead
too
with
its
pond
overhung
by
its
untidy
and
arbor
but
everywhere
the
bushy
hedgerows
wasted
the
land
with
their
straggling
beauty
shrouded
the
grassy
borders
of
the
pastures
with
catkined
hazels
and
tossed
their
long
blackberry
branches
on
the
perhaps
they
were
white
with
may
or
starred
with
pale
pink
perhaps
the
urchins
were
already
nutting
among
them
or
gathering
the
plenteous
crabs
it
was
worth
the
journey
only
to
see
those
hedgerows
the
liberal
homes
of
unmarketable
beauty
of
the
purple
blossomed
nightshade
of
the
wild
convolvulus
climbing
and
spreading
in
tendriled
strength
till
it
made
a
great
curtain
of
hearts
and
white
trumpets
of
the
which
in
its
most
delicate
fragrance
hid
a
charm
more
subtle
and
penetrating
than
beauty
even
if
it
were
winter
the
hedgerows
showed
their
coral
the
scarlet
haws
the
hips
with
lingering
brown
leaves
to
make
a
for
the
jewels
of
the
such
hedgerows
were
often
as
tall
as
the
cottages
dotted
along
the
lanes
or
clustered
into
a
small
hamlet
their
little
dingy
windows
telling
like
eyes
of
nothing
but
the
darkness
within
the
passenger
on
the
bowled
along
above
such
a
hamlet
saw
chiefly
the
roofs
of
it
probably
it
turned
its
back
on
the
road
and
seemed
to
lie
away
from
everything
but
its
own
patch
of
earth
and
sky
away
from
the
parish
church
by
long
fields
and
green
lanes
away
from
all
intercourse
except
that
of
tramps
if
its
face
could
be
seen
it
was
most
likely
dirty
but
the
dirt
was
protestant
dirt
and
the
big
bold
tramps
were
protestant
tramps
there
was
no
sign
of
superstition
near
no
crucifix
or
image
to
indicate
a
misguided
reverence
the
inhabitants
were
probably
so
free
from
superstition
that
they
were
in
much
less
awe
of
the
parson
than
of
the
overseer
yet
they
were
saved
from
the
excess
of
protestantism
by
not
knowing
how
to
read
and
by
the
absence
of
handlooms
and
mines
to
be
the
pioneers
of
dissent
they
were
kept
safely
in
the
of
indifference
and
could
have
registered
themselves
in
the
census
by
a
big
black
mark
as
members
of
the
church
of
england
but
there
were
trim
cheerful
villages
too
with
a
neat
or
handsome
parsonage
and
gray
church
set
in
the
midst
there
was
the
pleasant
tinkle
of
the
blacksmith
anvil
the
patient
cart
horses
waiting
at
his
door
the
peeling
his
willow
wands
in
the
sunshine
the
wheelwright
putting
his
last
touch
to
a
blue
cart
with
red
wheels
here
and
there
a
cottage
with
bright
transparent
windows
showing
pots
full
of
blooming
balsams
or
geraniums
and
little
gardens
in
front
all
double
daisies
or
dark
wallflowers
at
the
well
clean
and
comely
women
carrying
yoked
buckets
and
toward
the
free
school
small
britons
dawdling
on
and
handling
their
marbles
in
the
pockets
of
unpatched
corduroys
adorned
with
brass
buttons
the
land
around
was
rich
and
marly
great
stood
in
the
for
the
had
not
found
their
way
hither
the
homesteads
were
those
of
rich
farmers
who
paid
no
rent
or
had
the
rare
advantage
of
a
lease
and
could
afford
to
keep
the
corn
till
prices
had
risen
the
coach
would
be
sure
to
overtake
some
of
them
on
their
way
to
their
outlying
fields
or
to
the
sitting
heavily
on
their
horses
or
weighing
down
one
side
of
an
gig
they
probably
thought
of
the
coach
with
some
contempt
as
an
accommodation
for
people
who
had
not
their
own
gigs
or
who
wanting
to
travel
to
london
and
such
distant
places
belonged
to
the
trading
and
less
solid
part
of
the
nation
the
passenger
on
the
box
could
see
that
this
was
the
district
of
protuberant
optimists
sure
that
old
england
was
the
best
of
all
possible
countries
and
that
if
there
were
any
facts
which
had
not
fallen
under
their
own
observation
they
were
facts
not
worth
observing
the
district
of
clean
little
without
manufactures
of
fat
livings
an
aristocratic
clergy
and
low
but
as
the
day
wore
on
the
scene
would
change
the
land
would
begin
to
be
blackened
with
the
rattle
of
handlooms
to
be
heard
in
hamlets
and
villages
here
were
powerful
men
walking
queerly
with
knees
bent
outward
from
squatting
in
the
mine
going
home
to
throw
themselves
down
in
their
blackened
flannel
and
sleep
through
the
daylight
then
rise
and
spend
much
of
their
high
wages
at
the
with
their
fellows
of
the
benefit
club
here
the
pale
eager
faces
of
the
men
and
women
haggard
from
sitting
up
late
at
night
to
finish
the
week
work
hardly
begun
till
the
wednesday
everywhere
the
cottages
and
the
small
children
were
dirty
for
the
languid
mothers
gave
their
strength
to
the
loom
pious
dissenting
women
perhaps
who
took
life
patiently
and
thought
that
salvation
depended
chiefly
on
predestination
and
not
at
all
on
cleanliness
the
gables
of
dissenting
chapels
now
made
a
visible
sign
of
religion
and
of
a
to
counterbalance
the
even
in
the
hamlets
but
if
a
couple
of
old
termagants
were
seen
tearing
each
other
caps
it
was
a
safe
conclusion
that
if
they
had
not
received
the
sacraments
of
the
church
they
had
not
at
least
given
in
to
schismatic
rites
and
were
free
from
the
errors
of
voluntaryism
the
breath
of
the
manufacturing
town
which
made
a
cloudy
day
and
a
red
gloom
by
night
on
the
horizon
diffused
itself
over
all
the
surrounding
country
filling
the
air
with
eager
unrest
here
was
a
population
not
convinced
that
old
england
was
as
good
as
possible
here
were
multitudinous
men
and
women
aware
that
their
religion
was
not
exactly
the
religion
of
their
rulers
who
might
therefore
be
better
than
they
were
and
who
if
better
might
alter
many
things
which
now
made
the
world
perhaps
more
painful
than
it
need
be
and
certainly
more
sinful
yet
there
were
the
gray
steeples
too
and
the
churchyards
with
their
grassy
mounds
and
venerable
headstones
sleeping
in
the
sunlight
there
were
broad
fields
and
homesteads
and
fine
old
woods
covering
a
rising
ground
or
stretching
far
by
the
roadside
allowing
only
peeps
at
the
park
and
mansion
which
they
shut
in
from
the
world
in
these
midland
districts
the
traveller
passed
rapidly
from
one
phase
of
english
life
to
another
after
looking
down
on
a
village
dingy
with
noisy
with
the
shaking
of
looms
he
might
skirt
a
parish
all
of
fields
high
hedges
and
deep
rutted
lanes
after
the
coach
had
rattled
over
the
pavement
of
a
manufacturing
town
the
scenes
of
riots
and
meetings
it
would
take
him
in
another
ten
minutes
into
a
rural
region
where
the
neighborhood
of
the
town
was
only
felt
in
the
advantages
of
a
near
market
for
corn
cheese
and
hay
and
where
men
with
a
considerable
banking
account
were
accustomed
to
say
that
they
never
meddled
with
politics
themselves
the
busy
scenes
of
the
shuttle
and
the
wheel
of
the
roaring
furnace
of
the
shaft
and
the
pulley
seemed
to
make
but
crowded
nests
in
the
midst
of
the
life
of
homesteads
and
cottages
and
parks
looking
at
the
dwellings
scattered
amongst
the
woody
flats
and
the
plowed
uplands
under
the
low
gray
sky
which
overhung
them
with
an
unchanging
stillness
as
if
time
itself
were
pausing
it
was
easy
for
the
traveller
to
conceive
that
town
and
country
had
no
pulse
in
common
except
where
the
handlooms
made
a
straggling
fringe
about
the
great
centres
of
manufacture
that
till
the
agitation
about
the
catholics
in
rural
englishmen
had
hardly
known
more
of
catholics
than
of
the
fossil
mammals
and
that
their
notion
of
reform
was
a
confused
combination
of
nottingham
riots
and
in
general
whatever
required
the
calling
out
of
the
yeomanry
it
was
still
easier
to
see
that
for
the
most
part
they
resisted
the
rotation
of
crops
and
stood
by
their
fallows
and
the
coachman
would
perhaps
tell
how
in
one
parish
an
innovating
farmer
who
talked
of
sir
humphrey
davy
had
been
fairly
driven
out
by
popular
dislike
as
if
he
had
been
a
confounded
radical
and
how
the
parson
having
one
sunday
preached
from
the
words
break
up
your
the
people
thought
he
had
made
the
text
out
of
his
own
head
otherwise
it
would
never
have
come
so
pat
on
a
matter
of
business
but
when
they
found
it
in
the
bible
at
home
some
said
it
was
an
argument
for
fallows
else
why
should
the
bible
mention
fallows
but
a
few
of
the
weaker
sort
were
shaken
and
thought
it
was
an
argument
that
fallows
should
be
done
away
with
else
the
bible
would
have
said
let
your
fallows
lie
and
the
next
morning
the
parson
had
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
which
as
coincident
with
a
dispute
about
fallows
so
set
the
parish
against
the
innovating
farmer
and
the
rotation
of
crops
that
he
could
stand
his
ground
no
longer
and
transferred
his
lease
the
coachman
was
an
excellent
travelling
companion
and
commentator
on
the
landscape
he
could
tell
the
names
of
sites
and
persons
and
explain
the
meaning
of
groups
as
well
as
the
shade
of
virgil
in
a
more
memorable
journey
he
had
as
many
stories
about
parishes
and
the
men
and
women
in
them
as
the
wanderer
in
the
excursion
only
his
style
was
different
his
view
of
life
had
originally
been
genial
such
as
became
a
man
who
was
well
warmed
within
and
without
and
held
a
position
of
easy
undisputed
authority
but
the
recent
initiation
of
railways
had
embittered
him
he
now
as
in
a
perpetual
vision
saw
the
ruined
country
strewn
with
shattered
limbs
and
regarded
huskisson
death
as
a
proof
of
god
anger
against
stephenson
why
every
inn
on
the
road
would
be
shut
up
and
at
that
word
the
coachman
looked
before
him
with
the
blank
gaze
of
one
who
had
driven
his
coach
to
the
outermost
edge
of
the
universe
and
saw
his
leaders
plunging
into
the
abyss
still
he
would
soon
relapse
from
the
high
prophetic
strain
to
the
familiar
one
of
narrative
he
knew
whose
the
land
was
wherever
he
drove
what
noblemen
had
themselves
by
gambling
who
made
handsome
returns
of
rent
and
who
was
at
with
his
eldest
son
he
perhaps
remembered
the
fathers
of
actual
baronets
and
knew
stories
of
their
extravagant
or
stingy
housekeeping
whom
they
had
married
whom
they
had
horsewhipped
whether
they
were
particular
about
preserving
their
game
and
whether
they
had
had
much
to
do
with
canal
companies
about
any
actual
landed
proprietor
he
could
also
tell
whether
he
was
a
reformer
or
an
that
was
a
distinction
which
had
turned
up
in
latter
times
and
along
with
it
the
paradox
very
puzzling
to
the
mind
that
there
were
men
of
old
family
and
large
estate
who
voted
for
the
bill
he
did
not
grapple
with
the
paradox
he
let
it
pass
with
all
the
discreetness
of
an
experienced
theologian
or
learned
scholiast
preferring
to
point
his
whip
at
some
object
which
could
raise
no
questions
no
such
paradox
troubled
our
coachman
when
leaving
the
town
of
treby
magna
behind
him
he
drove
between
the
hedges
for
a
mile
or
so
crossed
the
queer
long
bridge
over
the
river
lapp
and
then
put
his
horses
to
a
swift
gallop
up
the
hill
by
the
village
of
little
treby
till
they
were
on
the
fine
level
road
skirted
on
one
side
by
grand
larches
oaks
and
wych
elms
which
sometimes
opened
so
far
as
to
let
the
traveller
see
that
there
was
a
park
behind
them
how
many
times
in
the
year
as
the
coach
rolled
past
the
lodges
which
interrupted
the
screen
of
trees
and
showed
the
river
winding
through
a
park
had
the
coachman
answered
the
same
questions
or
told
the
same
things
without
being
questioned
that
oh
that
was
transome
court
a
place
there
had
been
a
fine
sight
of
lawsuits
about
generations
back
the
heir
of
the
transome
name
had
somehow
bargained
away
the
estate
and
it
fell
to
the
durfeys
very
distant
connections
who
only
called
themselves
transomes
because
they
had
got
the
estate
but
the
durfeys
claim
had
been
disputed
over
and
over
again
and
the
coachman
if
he
had
been
asked
would
have
said
though
he
might
have
to
fall
down
dead
the
next
minute
that
property
did
always
get
into
the
right
hands
however
the
lawyers
had
found
their
luck
in
it
and
people
who
inherited
estates
that
were
lawed
about
often
lived
in
them
as
poorly
as
a
mouse
in
a
hollow
cheese
and
by
what
he
could
make
out
that
had
been
the
way
with
these
present
durfeys
or
transomes
as
they
called
themselves
as
for
transome
he
was
as
poor
a
fellow
as
you
wish
to
see
but
was
master
had
come
of
a
high
family
and
had
a
spirit
you
might
see
it
in
her
eye
and
the
way
she
sat
her
horse
forty
years
ago
when
she
came
into
this
country
they
said
she
was
a
pictur
but
her
family
was
poor
and
so
she
took
up
with
a
fellow
like
this
transome
and
the
eldest
son
had
been
just
such
another
as
his
father
only
worse
a
wild
sort
of
who
got
into
bad
company
they
said
his
mother
hated
him
and
wished
him
dead
for
got
another
son
quite
of
a
different
cut
who
had
gone
to
foreign
parts
when
he
was
a
youngster
and
she
wanted
her
favorite
to
be
heir
but
heir
or
no
heir
lawyer
jermyn
had
had
picking
out
of
the
estate
not
a
door
in
his
big
house
but
what
was
the
finest
polished
oak
all
got
off
the
transome
estate
if
anybody
liked
to
believe
he
paid
for
it
they
were
welcome
however
lawyer
jermyn
had
sat
on
that
many
and
many
a
time
he
had
made
the
wills
of
most
people
thereabout
the
coachman
would
not
say
that
lawyer
jermyn
was
not
the
man
he
would
choose
to
make
his
own
will
some
day
it
was
not
so
well
for
a
lawyer
to
be
else
he
might
not
be
up
to
other
people
tricks
and
as
for
the
transome
business
there
had
been
ins
and
outs
in
time
gone
by
so
that
you
could
look
into
it
straight
backward
at
this
sampson
everybody
in
north
loamshire
knew
sampson
coach
would
screw
his
features
into
a
grimace
expressive
of
entire
neutrality
and
appear
to
aim
his
whip
at
a
particular
spot
on
the
horse
flank
if
the
passenger
was
curious
for
further
knowledge
concerning
the
transome
affairs
sampson
would
shake
his
head
and
say
there
had
been
fine
stories
in
his
time
but
he
never
condescended
to
state
what
the
stories
were
some
attributed
this
reticence
to
a
wise
incredulity
others
to
a
want
of
memory
others
to
simple
ignorance
but
at
least
sampson
was
right
in
saying
that
there
had
been
fine
stories
meaning
ironically
stories
not
altogether
creditable
to
the
parties
concerned
and
such
stories
often
come
to
be
fine
in
a
sense
that
is
not
ironical
for
there
is
seldom
any
which
does
not
carry
along
with
it
some
downfall
of
hopes
some
hard
entail
of
suffering
some
desire
that
survives
with
the
life
in
death
of
old
paralytic
vice
to
see
itself
cursed
by
its
woeful
progeny
some
tragic
mark
of
kinship
in
the
one
brief
life
to
the
life
that
went
before
and
to
the
life
that
is
to
come
after
such
as
has
raised
the
pity
and
terror
of
men
ever
since
they
began
to
discern
between
will
and
destiny
but
these
things
are
often
unknown
to
the
world
for
there
is
much
pain
that
is
quite
noiseless
and
vibrations
that
make
human
agonies
are
often
a
mere
whisper
in
the
roar
of
hurrying
existence
there
are
glances
of
hatred
that
stab
and
raise
no
cry
of
murder
robberies
that
leave
man
or
woman
forever
beggared
of
peace
and
joy
yet
kept
secret
by
the
sufferer
committed
to
no
sound
except
that
of
low
moans
in
the
night
seen
in
no
writing
except
that
made
on
the
face
by
the
slow
months
of
suppressed
anguish
and
early
morning
tears
many
an
inherited
sorrow
that
has
marred
a
life
has
been
breathed
into
no
human
ear
the
poets
have
told
us
of
a
dolorous
enchanted
forest
in
the
under
world
the
there
and
the
stems
have
human
histories
hidden
in
them
the
power
of
unuttered
cries
dwells
in
the
branches
and
the
red
warm
blood
is
darkly
feeding
the
quivering
nerves
of
a
sleepless
memory
that
watches
through
all
dreams
these
things
are
a
parable

and
he
on
the
first
of
september
in
the
memorable
year
some
one
was
expected
at
transome
court
as
early
as
two
in
the
afternoon
the
aged
had
opened
the
heavy
gate
green
as
the
tree
trunks
were
green
with
nature
powdery
paint
deposited
year
after
year
already
in
the
village
of
little
treby
which
lay
on
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
not
far
off
the
the
elder
matrons
sat
in
their
best
gowns
at
the
few
cottage
doors
bordering
the
road
that
they
might
be
ready
to
get
up
and
make
their
courtesy
when
a
travelling
carriage
should
come
in
sight
and
beyond
the
village
several
small
boys
were
stationed
on
the
intending
to
run
a
race
to
the
old
church
where
the
sexton
waited
in
the
belfry
ready
to
set
the
one
bell
in
joyful
agitation
just
at
the
right
moment
the
old
had
opened
the
gate
and
left
it
in
the
charge
of
his
lame
wife
because
he
was
wanted
at
the
court
to
sweep
away
the
leaves
and
perhaps
to
help
in
the
stables
for
though
transome
court
was
a
large
mansion
built
in
the
fashion
of
queen
anne
time
with
a
park
and
grounds
as
fine
as
any
to
be
seen
in
loamshire
there
were
very
few
servants
about
it
especially
it
seemed
there
must
be
a
lack
of
gardeners
for
except
on
the
terrace
surrounded
with
a
stone
parapet
in
front
of
the
house
where
there
was
a
parterre
kept
with
some
neatness
grass
had
spread
itself
over
the
gravel
walks
and
over
all
the
low
mounds
once
carefully
cut
as
black
beds
for
the
shrubs
and
larger
plants
many
of
the
windows
had
the
shutters
closed
and
under
the
grand
scotch
fir
that
stooped
toward
one
corner
the
brown
of
many
years
lay
in
a
small
stone
balcony
in
front
of
two
such
darkened
windows
all
round
both
near
and
far
there
were
grand
trees
motionless
in
the
still
sunshine
and
like
all
large
motionless
things
seemed
to
add
to
the
stillness
here
and
there
a
leaf
fluttered
down
petals
fell
in
a
silent
shower
a
heavy
moth
fluttered
by
and
when
it
settled
seemed
to
fall
wearily
the
tiny
birds
alighted
on
the
walks
and
hopped
about
in
perfect
tranquillity
even
a
stray
rabbit
sat
nibbling
a
leaf
that
was
to
its
liking
in
the
middle
of
a
grassy
space
with
an
air
that
seemed
quite
impudent
in
so
timid
a
creature
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
louder
than
a
sleepy
hum
and
the
soft
monotony
of
running
water
hurrying
on
to
the
river
that
divided
the
park
standing
on
the
south
or
east
side
of
the
house
you
would
never
have
guessed
that
an
arrival
was
expected
but
on
the
west
side
where
the
carriage
entrance
was
the
gates
under
the
stone
archway
were
thrown
open
and
so
was
the
double
door
of
the
letting
in
the
warm
light
on
the
scagliola
pillars
the
marble
statues
and
the
broad
stone
staircase
with
its
matting
worn
into
large
holes
and
stronger
sign
of
expectation
than
all
from
one
of
the
doors
that
surrounded
the
there
came
forth
from
time
to
time
a
lady
who
walked
lightly
over
the
polished
stone
floor
and
stood
on
the
and
watched
and
listened
she
walked
lightly
for
her
figure
was
slim
and
finely
formed
though
she
was
between
fifty
and
sixty
she
was
a
tall
woman
with
abundant
gray
hair
dark
eyes
and
eyebrows
and
a
somewhat
yet
not
unfeminine
face
her
black
dress
was
much
worn
the
fine
lace
of
her
cuffs
and
collar
and
of
the
small
veil
that
fell
backward
over
her
high
comb
was
visibly
mended
but
rare
jewels
flashed
on
her
hands
which
lay
on
her
folded
arms
like
onyx
cameos
meantime
transome
went
to
the
watching
and
listening
in
vain
each
time
she
returned
to
the
same
room
it
was
a
comfortable
room
with
low
ebony
bookshelves
round
it
and
it
formed
an
to
a
large
library
of
which
a
glimpse
could
be
seen
through
an
open
doorway
partly
obstructed
by
a
heavy
tapestry
curtain
drawn
on
one
side
there
was
a
great
deal
of
tarnished
gilding
and
dinginess
on
the
walls
and
furniture
of
this
smaller
room
but
the
pictures
above
the
bookcases
were
all
of
a
cheerful
kind
portraits
in
pastel
of
ladies
with
blue
ribbons
and
low
bodices
a
splendid
portrait
in
oils
of
a
transome
in
the
gorgeous
dress
of
the
restoration
another
of
a
transome
in
his
boyhood
with
his
hand
on
the
neck
of
a
small
pony
and
a
large
flemish
where
war
seemed
only
a
picturesque
accident
in
a
vast
sunny
expanse
of
plain
and
sky
probably
such
cheerful
pictures
had
been
chosen
because
this
was
transome
usual
it
was
certainly
for
this
reason
that
near
the
chair
in
which
she
seated
herself
each
time
she
there
hung
a
picture
of
a
youthful
face
which
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
her
own
a
beardless
but
masculine
face
with
rich
brown
hair
hanging
low
on
the
forehead
and
undulating
beside
each
cheek
down
to
the
loose
white
cravat
near
this
same
chair
were
her
writing
table
with
on
it
the
cabinet
in
which
she
kept
her
drugs
her
basket
for
her
embroidery
a
folio
volume
of
architectural
engravings
from
which
she
took
her
a
number
of
the
north
loamshire
herald
and
the
cushion
for
her
fat
blenheim
which
was
too
old
and
sleepy
to
notice
its
restlessness
for
just
now
transome
could
not
abridge
the
sunny
tedium
of
the
day
by
the
feeble
interest
of
her
usual
indoor
occupations
her
consciousness
was
absorbed
by
memories
and
prospects
and
except
that
she
walked
to
the
to
look
out
she
sat
motionless
with
folded
arms
involuntarily
from
time
to
time
turning
toward
the
portrait
close
by
her
and
as
often
when
its
young
brown
eyes
met
hers
turning
away
again
with
resolution
at
last
prompted
by
some
sudden
thought
or
by
some
sound
she
rose
and
went
hastily
beyond
the
tapestry
curtain
into
the
library
she
paused
near
the
door
without
speaking
apparently
she
only
wished
to
see
that
no
harm
was
being
done
a
man
nearer
seventy
than
sixty
was
in
the
act
of
ranging
on
a
large
a
series
of
shallow
drawers
some
of
them
containing
dried
insects
others
mineralogical
specimens
his
pale
mild
eyes
receding
lower
jaw
and
slight
frame
could
never
have
expressed
much
vigor
either
bodily
or
mental
but
he
had
now
the
unevenness
of
gait
and
feebleness
of
gesture
which
tell
of
a
past
paralytic
seizure
his
threadbare
clothes
were
thoroughly
brushed
his
soft
white
hair
was
carefully
parted
and
arranged
he
was
not
a
old
man
and
at
his
side
a
fine
black
retriever
also
old
sat
on
its
haunches
and
watched
him
as
he
went
to
and
fro
but
when
transome
appeared
within
the
doorway
her
husband
paused
in
his
work
and
shrank
like
a
timid
animal
looked
at
in
a
cage
where
flight
was
impossible
he
was
conscious
of
a
troublesome
intention
for
which
he
had
been
rebuked
before
that
of
disturbing
all
his
specimens
with
a
view
to
a
new
arrangement
after
an
interval
in
which
his
wife
stood
perfectly
still
observing
him
he
began
to
put
back
the
drawers
in
their
places
in
the
row
of
cabinets
which
extended
under
the
bookshelves
at
one
end
of
the
library
when
they
were
all
put
back
and
closed
transome
turned
away
and
the
frightened
old
man
seated
himself
with
nimrod
the
retriever
on
an
ottoman
peeping
at
him
again
a
few
minutes
after
she
saw
that
he
had
his
arm
round
nimrod
neck
and
was
uttering
his
thoughts
to
the
dog
in
a
loud
whisper
as
little
children
do
to
any
object
near
them
when
they
believe
themselves
unwatched
at
last
the
sound
of
the
reached
transome
ear
and
she
knew
that
before
long
the
sound
of
wheels
must
be
within
hearing
but
she
did
not
at
once
start
up
and
walk
to
the
she
sat
still
quivering
and
listening
her
lips
became
pale
her
hands
were
cold
and
trembling
was
her
son
really
coming
she
was
far
beyond
fifty
and
since
her
early
gladness
in
this
boy
the
harvest
of
her
life
had
been
scanty
could
it
be
that
now
when
her
hair
was
gray
when
sight
had
become
one
of
the
day
fatigues
when
her
young
accomplishments
seemed
almost
ludicrous
like
the
tone
of
her
first
harpsichord
and
the
words
of
the
song
long
browned
with
age
she
was
going
to
reap
an
assured
joy
to
feel
that
the
doubtful
deeds
of
her
life
were
justified
by
the
result
since
a
kind
providence
had
sanctioned
them
to
be
no
longer
tacitly
pitied
by
her
neighbors
for
her
lack
of
money
her
imbecile
husband
her
graceless
and
the
loneliness
of
her
life
but
to
have
at
her
side
a
rich
clever
possibly
a
tender
son
yes
but
there
were
the
fifteen
years
of
separation
and
all
that
had
happened
in
that
long
time
to
throw
her
into
the
background
of
her
son
memory
and
affection
and
yet
did
not
men
sometimes
become
more
filial
in
their
feeling
when
experience
had
mellowed
them
and
they
had
themselves
become
fathers
still
if
transome
had
expected
only
her
son
she
would
have
trembled
less
she
expected
a
little
grandson
also
and
there
were
reasons
why
she
had
not
been
enraptured
when
her
son
had
written
to
her
only
when
he
was
on
the
eve
of
returning
that
he
already
had
an
heir
born
to
him
but
the
facts
must
be
accepted
as
they
stood
and
after
all
the
chief
thing
was
to
have
her
son
back
again
such
pride
such
affection
such
hopes
as
she
cherished
in
this
year
of
her
life
must
find
their
gratification
in
him
or
nowhere
once
more
she
glanced
at
the
portrait
the
young
brown
eyes
seemed
to
dwell
on
her
pleasantly
but
turning
from
it
with
a
sort
of
impatience
and
saying
aloud
of
course
he
will
be
altered
she
rose
almost
with
difficulty
and
walked
more
slowly
than
before
across
the
hall
to
the
already
the
sound
of
wheels
was
loud
upon
the
gravel
the
momentary
surprise
of
seeing
that
it
was
only
a
without
a
servant
or
much
luggage
that
was
passing
under
the
stone
archway
and
then
wheeling
round
against
the
flight
of
stone
steps
was
at
once
merged
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
dark
face
under
a
red
looking
at
her
from
the
window
she
saw
nothing
else
she
was
not
even
conscious
that
the
small
group
of
her
own
servants
had
mustered
or
that
old
hickes
the
butler
had
come
forward
to
open
the
chaise
door
she
heard
herself
called
mother
and
felt
a
light
kiss
on
each
cheek
but
stronger
than
all
that
sensation
was
the
consciousness
which
no
previous
thought
could
prepare
her
for
that
this
son
who
had
come
back
to
her
was
a
stranger
three
minutes
before
she
had
fancied
that
in
spite
of
all
changes
wrought
by
fifteen
years
of
separation
she
should
clasp
her
son
again
as
she
had
done
at
their
parting
but
in
the
moment
when
their
eyes
met
the
sense
of
strangeness
came
upon
her
like
a
terror
it
was
not
hard
to
understand
that
she
was
agitated
and
the
son
led
her
across
the
hall
to
the
closing
the
door
behind
them
then
he
turned
toward
her
and
said
smiling
you
would
not
have
known
me
eh
mother
it
was
perhaps
the
truth
if
she
had
seen
him
in
a
crowd
she
might
have
looked
at
him
without
recognition
not
however
without
startled
wonder
for
though
the
likeness
to
herself
was
no
longer
striking
the
years
had
overlaid
it
with
another
likeness
which
would
have
arrested
her
before
she
answered
him
his
eyes
with
a
keen
restlessness
as
unlike
as
possible
to
the
lingering
gaze
of
the
portrait
had
travelled
quickly
over
the
room
alighting
on
her
as
she
said
everything
is
changed
harold
i
am
an
old
woman
you
see
but
straighter
and
more
upright
than
some
of
the
young
ones
said
harold
inwardly
however
feeling
that
age
had
made
his
mother
face
very
anxious
and
eager
the
old
women
at
smyrna
are
like
sacks
not
got
clumsy
and
shapeless
how
is
it
i
have
the
trick
of
getting
fat
here
harold
lifted
his
arm
and
spread
out
his
plump
hand
i
remember
my
father
was
as
thin
as
a
herring
how
is
my
father
where
is
he
transome
just
pointed
to
the
curtained
doorway
and
let
her
son
pass
through
it
alone
she
was
not
given
to
tears
but
now
under
the
pressure
of
emotion
that
could
find
no
other
vent
they
burst
forth
she
took
care
that
they
should
be
silent
tears
and
before
harold
came
out
of
the
library
again
they
were
dried
transome
had
not
the
feminine
tendency
to
seek
influence
through
pathos
she
had
been
used
to
rule
in
virtue
of
acknowledged
superiority
the
consciousness
that
she
had
to
make
her
son
acquaintance
and
that
her
knowledge
of
the
youth
of
nineteen
might
help
her
little
in
interpreting
the
man
of
had
fallen
like
lead
on
her
soul
but
in
this
new
acquaintance
of
theirs
she
cared
especially
that
her
son
who
had
seen
a
strange
world
should
feel
that
he
was
come
home
to
a
mother
who
was
to
be
consulted
on
all
things
and
who
could
supply
his
lack
of
the
local
experience
necessary
to
an
english
landholder
her
part
in
life
had
been
that
of
the
clever
sinner
and
she
was
equipped
with
the
views
the
reasons
and
the
habits
which
belonged
to
that
character
life
would
have
little
meaning
for
her
if
she
were
to
be
gently
thrust
aside
as
a
harmless
elderly
woman
and
besides
there
were
secrets
which
her
son
must
never
know
so
by
the
time
harold
came
from
the
library
again
the
traces
of
tears
were
not
discernible
except
to
a
very
careful
observer
and
he
did
not
observe
his
mother
carefully
his
eyes
only
glanced
at
her
on
their
way
to
the
loamshire
lying
on
the
table
near
her
which
he
took
up
with
his
left
hand
as
he
said
gad
what
a
wreck
poor
father
is
paralysis
eh
terribly
shrunk
and
shaken
crawls
about
among
his
books
and
beetles
as
usual
though
well
it
a
slow
and
easy
death
but
he
not
much
over
is
he
counting
by
birthdays
but
your
father
was
born
old
i
think
said
transome
a
little
flushed
with
the
determination
not
to
show
any
unasked
for
feeling
her
son
did
not
notice
her
all
the
time
he
had
been
speaking
his
eyes
had
been
running
down
the
columns
of
the
newspaper
but
your
little
boy
harold
where
is
he
how
is
it
he
has
not
come
with
you
oh
i
left
him
behind
in
town
said
harold
still
looking
at
the
paper
my
man
dominic
will
bring
him
with
the
rest
of
the
luggage
ah
i
see
it
is
young
debarry
and
not
my
old
friend
sir
maximus
who
is
offering
himself
as
candidate
for
north
loamshire
yes
you
did
not
answer
me
when
i
wrote
to
you
to
london
about
your
standing
there
is
no
other
tory
candidate
spoken
of
and
you
would
have
all
the
debarry
interest
i
hardly
think
that
said
harold
significantly
why
jermyn
says
a
tory
candidate
can
never
be
got
in
without
it
but
i
shall
not
be
a
tory
candidate
transome
felt
something
like
an
electric
shock
what
then
she
said
almost
sharply
you
will
not
call
yourself
a
whig
god
forbid
i
a
radical
transome
limbs
tottered
she
sank
into
a
chair
here
was
a
distinct
confirmation
of
the
vague
but
strong
feeling
that
her
son
was
a
stranger
to
her
here
was
a
revelation
to
which
it
seemed
almost
as
impossible
to
adjust
her
hopes
and
notions
of
a
dignified
life
as
if
her
son
had
said
that
he
had
been
converted
to
mahometanism
at
smyrna
and
had
four
wives
instead
of
one
son
shortly
to
arrive
under
the
care
of
dominic
for
the
moment
she
had
a
sickening
feeling
that
it
was
of
no
use
that
the
good
fortune
had
come
at
last
all
of
no
use
though
the
unloved
durfey
was
dead
and
buried
and
though
harold
had
come
home
with
plenty
of
money
there
were
rich
radicals
she
was
aware
as
there
were
rich
jews
and
dissenters
but
she
had
never
thought
of
them
as
county
people
sir
francis
burdett
had
been
generally
regarded
as
a
madman
it
was
better
to
ask
no
questions
but
silently
to
prepare
herself
for
anything
else
there
might
be
to
come
will
you
go
to
your
rooms
harold
and
see
if
there
is
anything
you
would
like
to
have
altered
yes
let
us
go
said
harold
throwing
down
the
newspaper
in
which
he
had
been
rapidly
reading
almost
every
advertisement
while
his
mother
had
been
going
through
her
sharp
inward
struggle
uncle
lingon
is
on
the
bench
still
i
see
he
went
on
as
he
followed
her
across
the
hall
is
he
at
home
will
he
be
here
this
evening
he
says
you
must
go
to
the
rectory
when
you
want
to
see
him
you
must
remember
you
have
come
back
to
a
family
with
notions
your
uncle
thought
i
ought
to
have
you
to
myself
in
the
first
hour
or
two
he
remembered
that
i
had
not
seen
my
son
for
fifteen
years
ah
by
jove
fifteen
years
so
it
is
said
harold
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
it
under
his
arm
for
he
had
perceived
that
her
words
were
charged
with
an
intention
and
you
are
as
straight
as
an
arrow
still
you
will
carry
the
shawls
i
have
brought
you
as
well
as
ever
they
walked
up
the
broad
stone
steps
together
in
silence
under
the
shock
of
discovering
her
son
radicalism
transome
had
no
impulse
to
say
one
thing
rather
than
another
as
in
a
man
who
had
just
been
branded
on
the
forehead
all
wonted
motives
would
be
uprooted
harold
on
his
side
had
no
wish
opposed
to
filial
kindness
but
his
busy
thoughts
were
determined
by
habits
which
had
no
reference
to
any
feelings
and
even
if
he
could
have
conceived
what
his
mother
feeling
was
his
mind
after
that
momentary
arrest
would
have
darted
forward
on
its
usual
course
i
have
given
you
the
south
rooms
harold
said
transome
as
they
passed
along
a
corridor
lit
from
above
and
lined
with
old
family
pictures
i
thought
they
would
suit
you
best
as
they
all
open
into
each
other
and
this
middle
one
will
make
a
pleasant
for
you
gad
the
furniture
is
in
a
bad
state
said
harold
glancing
around
at
the
middle
room
which
they
had
just
entered
the
moths
seem
to
have
got
into
the
carpets
and
hangings
i
had
no
choice
except
moths
or
tenants
who
would
pay
rent
said
transome
we
have
been
too
poor
to
keep
servants
for
uninhabited
rooms
what
you
been
rather
pinched
eh
you
find
us
living
as
we
have
been
living
these
twelve
years
ah
you
had
durfey
debts
as
well
as
the
lawsuits
confound
them
it
will
make
a
hole
in
sixty
thousand
pounds
to
pay
off
the
mortgages
however
he
gone
now
poor
fellow
and
i
suppose
i
should
have
spent
more
in
buying
an
english
estate
some
time
or
other
i
always
meant
to
be
an
englishman
and
thrash
a
lord
or
two
who
thrashed
me
at
eton
i
hardly
thought
you
could
have
meant
that
harold
when
i
found
you
had
married
a
foreign
wife
would
you
have
had
me
wait
for
a
consumptive
lackadaisical
englishwoman
who
would
have
hung
all
her
relations
around
my
neck
i
hate
english
wives
they
want
to
give
their
opinion
about
everything
they
interfere
with
a
man
life
i
shall
not
marry
again
transome
bit
her
lip
and
turned
away
to
draw
up
a
blind
she
would
not
reply
to
words
which
showed
how
completely
any
conception
of
herself
and
her
feelings
was
excluded
from
her
son
inward
world
as
she
turned
round
again
she
said
i
suppose
you
have
been
used
to
great
luxury
these
rooms
look
miserable
to
you
but
you
can
soon
make
any
alterations
you
like
oh
i
must
have
a
private
fitted
up
for
myself
and
the
rest
are
bedrooms
i
suppose
he
went
on
opening
a
ah
i
can
sleep
here
a
night
or
two
but
there
a
bedroom
with
an
i
remember
that
would
do
for
my
man
dominic
and
the
little
boy
i
should
like
to
have
that
your
father
has
slept
there
for
years
he
will
be
like
a
distracted
insect
and
never
know
where
to
go
if
you
alter
the
track
he
has
to
walk
in
that
a
pity
i
hate
going
there
is
the
steward
room
it
is
not
used
and
might
be
turned
into
a
bedroom
i
ca
offer
you
my
room
for
i
sleep
transome
tongue
could
be
a
whip
upon
occasion
but
the
lash
had
not
fallen
on
a
sensitive
spot
no
i
determined
not
to
sleep
we
see
about
the
steward
room
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
find
a
closet
of
some
sort
for
dominic
it
a
nuisance
he
had
to
stay
behind
for
i
shall
have
nobody
to
cook
for
me
ah
there
the
old
river
i
used
to
fish
in
i
often
thought
when
i
was
at
smyrna
that
i
would
buy
a
park
with
a
river
through
it
as
much
like
the
lapp
as
possible
gad
what
fine
oaks
those
are
opposite
some
of
them
must
come
down
though
i
held
every
tree
sacred
on
the
demesne
as
i
told
you
harold
i
trusted
to
your
getting
the
estate
some
time
and
releasing
it
and
i
determined
to
keep
it
worth
releasing
a
park
without
fine
timber
is
no
better
than
a
beauty
without
teeth
and
hair
bravo
mother
said
harold
putting
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
ah
you
had
to
worry
yourself
about
things
that
do
properly
belong
to
a
woman
my
father
being
weakly
we
set
all
that
right
you
shall
have
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
be
grandmamma
on
satin
cushions
you
must
excuse
me
from
the
satin
cushions
that
is
a
part
of
the
old
woman
duty
i
am
not
prepared
for
i
am
used
to
be
chief
bailiff
and
to
sit
in
the
saddle
two
or
three
hours
every
day
there
are
two
farms
on
our
hands
besides
the
home
farm
jermyn
manages
the
estate
badly
then
that
will
not
last
under
reign
said
harold
turning
on
his
heel
and
feeling
in
his
pockets
for
the
keys
of
his
portmanteaus
which
had
been
brought
up
perhaps
when
you
been
in
england
a
little
longer
said
transome
coloring
as
if
she
had
been
a
girl
you
will
understand
better
the
difficulty
there
is
in
letting
farms
these
times
i
understand
the
difficulty
perfectly
mother
to
let
farms
a
man
must
have
the
sense
to
see
what
will
make
them
inviting
to
farmers
and
to
get
sense
supplied
on
demand
is
just
the
most
difficult
transaction
i
know
of
i
suppose
if
i
ring
there
some
fellow
who
can
act
as
valet
and
learn
to
attend
to
my
hookah
there
is
hickes
the
butler
and
there
is
jabez
the
footman
those
are
all
the
men
in
the
house
they
were
here
when
you
left
oh
i
remember
jabez
he
was
a
dolt
i
have
old
hickes
he
was
a
neat
little
machine
of
a
butler
his
words
used
to
come
like
the
clicks
of
an
engine
he
must
be
an
old
machine
now
though
you
seem
to
remember
some
things
about
home
wonderfully
well
harold
never
forget
places
and
people
how
they
look
and
what
can
be
done
with
them
all
the
country
round
here
lies
like
a
map
in
my
brain
a
deuced
pretty
country
too
but
the
people
were
a
stupid
set
of
old
whigs
and
tories
i
suppose
they
are
much
as
they
were
i
am
at
least
harold
you
are
the
first
of
your
family
that
ever
talked
of
being
a
radical
i
did
not
think
i
was
taking
care
of
our
old
oaks
for
that
i
always
thought
radicals
houses
stood
staring
above
poor
sticks
of
young
trees
and
iron
hurdles
yes
but
the
radical
sticks
are
growing
mother
and
half
the
tory
oaks
are
rotting
said
harold
with
gay
carelessness
you
arranged
for
jermyn
to
be
early
he
will
be
here
to
breakfast
at
nine
but
i
leave
you
to
hickes
now
we
dine
in
an
hour
transome
went
away
and
shut
herself
in
her
own
it
had
come
to
pass
now
this
meeting
with
the
son
who
had
been
the
object
of
so
much
longing
whom
she
had
longed
for
before
he
was
born
for
whom
she
had
sinned
from
whom
she
had
wrenched
herself
with
pain
at
their
parting
and
whose
coming
again
had
been
the
one
great
hope
of
her
years
the
moment
was
gone
by
there
had
been
no
ecstasy
no
gladness
even
hardly
half
an
hour
had
passed
and
few
words
had
been
spoken
yet
with
that
quickness
in
weaving
new
futures
which
belongs
to
women
whose
actions
have
kept
them
in
habitual
fear
of
consequences
transome
thought
she
saw
with
all
the
clearness
of
demonstration
that
her
son
return
had
not
been
a
good
for
her
in
the
sense
of
making
her
any
happier
she
stood
before
a
tall
mirror
going
close
to
it
and
looking
at
her
face
with
hard
scrutiny
as
if
it
were
unrelated
to
herself
no
elderly
face
can
be
handsome
looked
at
in
that
way
every
little
detail
is
startlingly
prominent
and
the
effect
of
the
whole
is
lost
she
saw
the
complexion
and
the
deep
lines
of
bitter
discontent
about
the
mouth
i
am
a
hag
she
said
to
herself
she
was
accustomed
to
give
her
thoughts
a
very
sharp
outline
an
ugly
old
woman
who
happens
to
be
his
mother
that
is
what
he
sees
in
me
as
i
see
a
stranger
in
him
i
shall
count
for
nothing
i
was
foolish
to
expect
anything
else
she
turned
away
from
the
mirror
and
walked
up
and
down
her
room
what
a
likeness
she
said
in
a
loud
whisper
yet
perhaps
no
one
will
see
it
besides
me
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
and
sat
with
a
fixed
look
seeing
nothing
that
was
actually
present
but
inwardly
seeing
with
painful
vividness
what
had
been
present
with
her
a
little
more
than
thirty
years
ago
the
little
creature
that
had
been
leaning
against
her
knees
and
stamping
tiny
feet
and
looking
up
at
her
with
gurgling
laughter
she
had
thought
that
the
possession
of
this
child
would
give
unity
to
her
life
and
make
some
gladness
through
the
changing
years
that
would
grow
as
fruit
out
of
these
early
maternal
caresses
but
nothing
had
come
just
as
she
had
wished
the
mother
early
raptures
had
lasted
but
a
short
time
and
even
while
they
lasted
there
had
grown
up
in
the
midst
of
them
a
hungry
desire
like
a
black
poisonous
plant
feeding
in
the
sunlight
the
desire
that
her
first
rickety
ugly
imbecile
child
should
die
and
leave
room
for
her
darling
of
whom
she
could
be
proud
such
desires
make
life
a
hideous
lottery
where
everyday
may
turn
up
a
blank
where
men
and
women
who
have
the
softest
beds
and
the
most
delicate
eating
who
have
a
very
large
share
of
that
sky
and
earth
which
some
are
born
to
have
no
more
of
than
the
fraction
to
be
got
in
a
crowded
entry
yet
grow
haggard
fevered
and
restless
like
those
who
watch
in
other
lotteries
day
after
day
year
after
year
had
yielded
blanks
new
cares
had
come
bringing
other
desires
for
results
quite
beyond
her
grasp
which
must
also
be
watched
for
in
the
lottery
and
all
the
while
the
pet
had
been
growing
into
a
strong
youth
who
liked
many
things
better
than
his
mother
caresses
and
who
had
a
much
keener
consciousness
of
his
independent
existence
than
of
his
relation
to
her
the
lizard
egg
that
white
rounded
passive
prettiness
had
become
a
brown
darting
determined
lizard
the
love
is
at
first
an
absorbing
delight
blunting
all
other
sensibilities
it
is
an
expansion
of
the
animal
existence
it
enlarges
the
imagined
range
for
self
to
move
in
but
in
after
years
it
can
only
continue
to
be
joy
on
the
same
terms
as
other
love
that
is
by
much
suppression
of
self
and
power
of
living
in
the
experience
of
another
transome
had
darkly
felt
the
pressure
of
that
unchangeable
fact
yet
she
had
clung
to
the
belief
that
somehow
the
possession
of
this
son
was
the
best
thing
she
lived
for
to
believe
otherwise
would
have
made
her
memory
too
ghastly
a
companion
some
time
or
other
by
some
means
the
estate
she
was
struggling
to
save
from
the
grasp
of
the
law
would
be
harold
somehow
the
hated
durfey
the
imbecile
eldest
who
seemed
to
have
become
tenacious
of
a
despicable
squandering
life
would
be
got
rid
of
vice
might
kill
him
meanwhile
the
estate
was
burdened
there
was
no
good
prospect
for
any
heir
harold
must
go
and
make
a
career
for
himself
and
this
was
what
he
was
bent
on
with
a
precocious
clearness
of
perception
as
to
the
conditions
on
which
he
could
hope
for
any
advantages
in
life
like
most
energetic
natures
he
had
a
strong
faith
in
his
luck
he
had
been
gay
at
their
parting
and
had
promised
to
make
his
fortune
and
in
spite
of
past
disappointments
harold
possible
fortune
still
made
some
ground
for
his
mother
to
plant
her
hopes
in
his
luck
had
not
failed
him
yet
nothing
had
turned
out
according
to
her
expectations
her
life
had
been
like
a
spoiled
shabby
in
which
the
music
and
the
processions
are
all
missed
and
nothing
is
left
at
evening
but
the
weariness
of
striving
after
what
has
been
failed
of
harold
had
gone
with
the
embassy
to
constantinople
under
the
patronage
of
a
high
relative
his
mother
cousin
he
was
to
be
diplomatist
and
work
his
way
upward
in
public
life
but
his
luck
had
taken
another
shape
he
had
saved
the
life
of
an
armenian
banker
who
in
gratitude
had
offered
him
a
prospect
which
his
practical
mind
had
preferred
to
the
problematic
promises
of
diplomacy
and
cousinship
harold
had
become
a
merchant
and
banker
at
smyrna
and
let
the
years
pass
without
caring
to
find
the
possibility
of
visiting
his
early
home
and
had
shown
no
eagerness
to
make
his
life
at
all
familiar
to
his
mother
asking
for
letters
about
england
but
writing
scantily
about
himself
transome
had
kept
up
the
habit
of
writing
to
her
son
but
gradually
the
unfruitful
years
had
dulled
her
hopes
and
yearnings
increasing
anxieties
about
money
had
worried
her
and
she
was
more
sure
of
being
fretted
by
bad
news
about
her
dissolute
eldest
son
than
of
hearing
anything
to
cheer
her
from
harold
she
had
begun
to
live
merely
in
small
immediate
cares
and
occupations
and
like
all
women
who
advance
in
life
without
any
activity
of
tenderness
or
any
large
sympathy
she
had
contracted
small
rigid
habits
of
thinking
and
acting
she
had
her
ways
which
must
not
be
crossed
and
had
learned
to
fill
up
the
great
void
of
life
with
giving
small
orders
to
tenants
insisting
on
medicines
for
infirm
cottagers
winning
small
triumphs
in
bargains
and
personal
economies
and
parrying
remarks
of
lady
by
epigrams
so
her
life
had
gone
on
till
more
than
a
year
ago
when
that
desire
which
had
been
so
hungry
when
she
was
a
blooming
young
mother
was
at
last
fulfilled
at
last
when
her
hair
was
gray
and
her
face
looked
bitter
restless
and
unenjoying
like
her
life
the
news
came
from
jersey
that
durfey
the
imbecile
son
was
dead
harold
was
heir
to
the
estate
now
the
wealth
he
had
gained
could
release
the
land
from
its
burdens
now
he
would
think
it
worth
while
to
return
home
a
change
had
come
over
her
life
and
the
sunlight
breaking
the
clouds
at
evening
was
pleasant
though
the
sun
must
sink
before
long
hopes
affections
the
sweeter
part
of
her
memories
started
from
their
wintry
sleep
and
it
once
more
seemed
a
great
good
to
have
had
a
second
son
who
in
some
ways
had
cost
her
dearly
but
again
there
were
conditions
she
had
not
reckoned
on
when
the
good
tidings
had
been
sent
to
harold
and
he
had
announced
that
he
would
return
so
soon
as
he
could
wind
up
his
affairs
he
had
for
the
first
time
informed
his
mother
that
he
had
been
married
that
his
greek
wife
was
no
longer
living
but
that
he
should
bring
home
a
little
boy
the
finest
and
most
desirable
of
heirs
and
grandsons
harold
seated
in
his
distant
smyrna
home
considered
that
he
was
taking
a
rational
view
of
what
things
must
have
become
by
this
time
at
the
old
place
in
england
when
he
figured
his
mother
as
a
good
elderly
lady
who
would
necessarily
be
delighted
with
the
possession
on
any
terms
of
a
healthy
grandchild
and
would
not
mind
much
about
the
particulars
of
a
marriage
transome
had
torn
up
that
letter
in
a
rage
but
in
the
months
which
had
elapsed
before
harold
could
actually
arrive
she
had
prepared
herself
as
well
as
she
could
to
suppress
all
reproaches
or
queries
which
her
son
might
resent
and
to
acquiesce
in
his
evident
wishes
the
return
was
still
looked
for
with
longing
affection
and
satisfied
pride
would
again
warm
her
later
years
she
was
ignorant
what
sort
of
man
harold
had
become
now
and
of
course
he
must
be
changed
in
many
ways
but
though
she
told
herself
this
still
the
image
that
she
knew
the
image
fondness
clung
to
necessarily
prevailed
over
the
negatives
insisted
on
by
her
reason
and
so
it
was
that
when
she
had
moved
to
the
door
to
meet
him
she
had
been
sure
that
she
should
clasp
her
son
again
and
feel
that
he
was
the
same
who
had
been
her
boy
her
little
one
the
loved
child
of
her
passionate
youth
an
hour
seemed
to
have
changed
everything
for
her
a
woman
hopes
are
woven
of
sunbeams
a
shadow
annihilates
them
the
shadow
which
had
fallen
over
transome
in
this
first
interview
with
her
son
was
the
presentiment
of
her
powerlessness
if
things
went
wrong
if
harold
got
unpleasantly
disposed
in
a
certain
direction
where
her
chief
dread
had
always
lain
she
seemed
to
foresee
that
her
words
would
be
of
no
avail
the
keenness
of
her
anxiety
in
this
matter
had
served
as
insight
and
harold
rapidity
decision
and
indifference
to
any
impressions
in
others
which
did
not
further
or
impede
his
own
purposes
had
made
themselves
felt
by
her
as
much
as
she
would
have
felt
the
unmanageable
strength
of
a
great
bird
which
had
alighted
near
her
and
allowed
her
to
stroke
its
wing
for
a
moment
because
food
lay
near
her
under
the
cold
weight
of
these
thoughts
transome
shivered
that
physical
reaction
roused
her
from
her
reverie
and
she
could
now
hear
the
gentle
knocking
at
the
door
to
which
she
had
been
deaf
before
notwithstanding
her
activity
and
the
fewness
of
her
servants
she
had
never
dressed
herself
without
aid
nor
would
that
small
neat
exquisitely
clean
old
woman
who
now
presented
herself
have
wished
that
her
labor
should
be
saved
at
the
expense
of
such
a
sacrifice
on
her
lady
part
the
small
old
woman
was
hickes
the
butler
wife
who
acted
as
housekeeper
and
superintendent
of
the
kitchen
the
large
stony
scene
of
inconsiderable
cooking
forty
years
ago
she
had
entered
transome
service
when
that
lady
was
beautiful
miss
lingon
and
her
mistress
still
called
her
denner
as
she
had
done
in
the
old
days
the
bell
has
rung
then
denner
without
my
hearing
it
said
transome
rising
yes
madam
said
denner
reaching
from
a
wardrobe
an
old
black
velvet
dress
trimmed
with
point
in
which
transome
was
wont
to
look
queenly
of
an
evening
denner
had
still
strong
eyes
of
that
kind
which
sees
through
the
narrowest
chink
between
the
eyelashes
the
physical
contrast
between
the
tall
lady
and
the
little
peering
waiting
woman
who
had
been
and
of
pale
mealy
complexion
from
her
youth
up
had
doubtless
had
a
strong
influence
in
determining
denner
feeling
toward
her
mistress
which
was
of
that
worshipful
sort
paid
to
a
goddess
in
ages
when
it
was
not
thought
necessary
or
likely
that
a
goddess
should
be
very
moral
there
were
different
orders
of
beings
so
ran
denner
creed
and
she
belonged
to
another
order
than
that
to
which
her
mistress
belonged
she
had
a
mind
as
sharp
as
a
needle
and
would
have
seen
through
and
through
the
ridiculous
pretensions
of
a
born
servant
who
did
not
submissively
accept
the
rigid
fate
which
had
given
her
born
superiors
she
would
have
called
such
pretensions
the
wrigglings
of
a
worm
that
tried
to
walk
on
its
tail
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
that
denner
knew
all
her
secrets
and
her
speech
was
plain
and
unflattering
yet
with
wonderful
subtlety
of
instinct
she
never
said
anything
which
transome
could
feel
humiliated
by
as
by
familiarity
from
a
servant
who
knew
too
much
denner
identified
her
own
dignity
with
that
of
her
mistress
she
was
a
godless
little
woman
but
with
a
character
to
be
reckoned
on
as
you
reckon
on
the
qualities
of
iron
peering
into
transome
face
she
saw
clearly
that
the
meeting
with
the
son
had
been
a
disappointment
in
some
way
she
spoke
with
a
refined
accent
in
a
low
quick
monotonous
tone
harold
is
dressed
he
shook
me
by
the
hand
in
the
corridor
and
was
very
pleasant
what
an
alteration
denner
no
likeness
to
me
now
handsome
though
spite
of
his
being
so
browned
and
stout
there
a
fine
presence
about
harold
i
remember
you
used
to
say
madam
there
were
some
people
you
would
always
know
were
in
the
room
though
they
stood
round
a
corner
and
others
you
might
never
see
till
you
ran
against
them
that
as
true
as
truth
and
as
for
likenesses
and
sixty
are
not
much
alike
only
to
people
memories
transome
knew
perfectly
that
denner
had
divined
her
thoughts
i
do
know
how
things
will
go
on
now
but
it
seems
something
too
good
to
happen
that
they
will
go
on
well
i
am
afraid
of
ever
expecting
anything
good
again
that
weakness
madam
things
do
happen
because
they
bad
or
good
else
all
eggs
would
be
addled
or
none
at
all
and
at
the
most
it
is
but
six
to
the
dozen
there
good
chances
and
bad
chances
and
nobody
luck
is
pulled
only
by
one
string
what
a
woman
you
are
denner
you
talk
like
a
french
infidel
it
seems
to
me
you
are
afraid
of
nothing
i
have
been
full
of
fears
all
my
life
always
seeing
something
or
other
hanging
over
me
that
i
bear
to
happen
well
madam
put
a
good
face
on
it
and
do
seem
to
be
on
the
for
crows
else
you
set
other
people
watching
here
you
have
a
rich
son
come
home
and
the
debts
will
all
be
paid
and
you
have
your
health
and
can
ride
about
and
you
such
a
face
and
figure
and
will
have
if
you
live
to
be
eighty
that
everybody
is
cap
in
hand
to
you
before
they
know
you
who
are
let
me
fasten
up
your
veil
a
little
higher
there
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
in
life
for
you
yet
nonsense
there
no
pleasure
for
old
women
unless
they
get
it
out
of
tormenting
other
people
what
are
your
pleasures
denner
besides
being
a
slave
to
me
oh
there
pleasure
in
knowing
one
not
a
fool
like
half
the
people
one
sees
about
and
managing
one
husband
is
some
pleasure
and
doing
all
one
business
well
why
if
i
only
got
some
orange
flowers
to
candy
i
should
like
to
die
till
i
see
them
all
right
then
the
sunshine
now
and
then
i
like
that
as
the
cats
do
i
look
upon
it
life
is
like
our
game
at
whist
when
banks
and
his
wife
come
to
the
of
an
evening
i
do
enjoy
the
game
much
but
i
like
to
play
my
cards
well
and
see
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
and
i
want
to
see
you
make
the
best
of
your
hand
madam
for
your
luck
has
been
mine
these
forty
years
now
but
i
must
go
and
see
how
kitty
dishes
up
the
dinner
unless
you
have
any
more
commands
no
denner
i
am
going
down
immediately
as
transome
descended
the
stone
staircase
in
her
old
black
velvet
and
point
her
appearance
justified
denner
personal
compliment
she
had
that
imperious
air
which
would
have
marked
her
as
an
object
of
hatred
and
reviling
by
a
revolutionary
mob
her
person
was
too
typical
of
social
distinctions
to
be
passed
by
with
indifference
by
any
one
it
would
have
fitted
an
empress
in
her
own
right
who
had
had
to
rule
in
spite
of
faction
to
dare
the
violation
of
treaties
and
dread
retributive
invasions
to
grasp
after
new
territories
to
be
defiant
in
desperate
circumstances
and
to
feel
a
woman
hunger
of
the
heart
forever
unsatisfied
yet
transome
cares
and
occupations
had
not
been
at
all
of
an
imperial
sort
for
thirty
years
she
had
led
the
monotonous
narrowing
life
which
used
to
be
the
lot
of
our
poorer
gentry
who
never
went
to
town
and
were
probably
not
on
speaking
terms
with
two
out
of
the
five
families
whose
parks
lay
within
the
distance
of
a
drive
when
she
was
young
she
had
been
thought
wonderfully
clever
and
accomplished
and
had
been
rather
ambitious
of
intellectual
superiority
had
secretly
picked
out
for
private
reading
the
higher
parts
of
dangerous
french
authors
and
in
company
had
been
able
to
talk
of
burke
style
or
of
chateaubriand
eloquence
had
laughed
at
the
lyrical
ballads
and
admired
southey
thalaba
she
always
thought
that
the
dangerous
french
writers
were
wicked
and
that
her
reading
of
them
was
a
sin
but
many
sinful
things
were
highly
agreeable
to
her
and
many
things
which
she
did
not
doubt
to
be
good
and
true
were
dull
and
meaningless
she
found
ridicule
of
biblical
characters
very
amusing
and
she
was
interested
in
stories
of
illicit
passion
but
she
believed
all
the
while
that
truth
and
safety
lay
in
due
attendance
on
prayers
and
sermons
in
the
admirable
doctrines
and
ritual
of
the
church
of
england
equally
remote
from
puritanism
and
popery
in
fact
in
such
a
view
of
this
world
and
the
next
as
would
preserve
the
existing
arrangements
of
english
society
quite
unshaken
keeping
down
the
obtrusiveness
of
the
vulgar
and
the
discontent
of
the
poor
the
history
of
the
jews
she
knew
ought
to
be
preferred
to
any
profane
history
the
pagans
of
course
were
vicious
and
their
religions
quite
nonsensical
considered
as

classical
learning
came
from
the
pagans
the
greeks
were
famous
for

the

for

the

were

though
a

and

in
foreign
countries
in
our
favored
land
was
clearly
seen
to
be
carried
forward
on

principles
sustained
by
the
succession
of
the
house
of
brunswick
and
by
sound
english
divines
for
miss
lingon
had
had
a
superior
governess
who
held
that
a
woman
should
be
able
to
write
a
good
letter
and
to
express
herself
with
propriety
on
general
subjects
and
it
is
astonishing
how
effective
this
education
appeared
in
a
handsome
girl
who
sat
supremely
well
on
horseback
sang
and
played
a
little
painted
small
figures
in
had
a
naughty
sparkle
in
her
eyes
when
she
made
a
daring
quotation
and
an
air
of
serious
dignity
when
she
recited
something
from
her
store
of
correct
opinions
but
however
such
a
stock
of
ideas
may
be
made
to
tell
in
elegant
society
and
during
a
few
seasons
in
town
no
amount
of
bloom
and
beauty
can
make
them
a
perennial
source
of
interest
in
things
not
personal
and
the
notion
that
what
is
true
and
in
general
good
for
mankind
is
stupid
and
is
not
a
safe
theoretic
basis
in
circumstances
of
temptation
and
difficulty
transome
had
been
in
her
bloom
before
this
century
began
and
in
the
long
painful
years
since
then
what
she
had
once
regarded
as
her
knowledge
and
accomplishments
had
become
as
valueless
as
stucco
ornaments
of
which
the
substance
was
never
worth
anything
while
the
form
is
no
longer
to
the
taste
of
any
living
mortal
crosses
mortifications
conscious
had
changed
the
aspect
of
the
world
for
her
there
was
anxiety
in
the
morning
sunlight
there
was
unkind
triumph
or
disapproving
pity
in
the
glances
of
greeting
neighbors
there
was
advancing
age
and
a
contracting
prospect
in
the
changing
seasons
as
they
came
and
went
and
what
could
then
sweeten
the
days
to
a
hungry
self
like
transome
under
protracted
ill
every
living
creature
will
find
something
that
makes
a
comparative
ease
and
even
when
life
seems
woven
of
pain
will
convert
the
fainter
pang
into
a
desire
transome
whose
imperious
will
had
availed
little
to
ward
off
the
great
evils
of
her
life
found
the
opiate
for
her
discontent
in
the
exertion
of
her
will
about
smaller
things
she
was
not
cruel
and
could
not
enjoy
thoroughly
what
she
called
the
old
woman
pleasure
of
tormenting
but
she
liked
every
little
sign
of
power
her
lot
had
left
her
she
liked
that
a
tenant
should
stand
bareheaded
below
her
as
she
sat
on
horseback
she
liked
to
insist
that
work
done
without
her
orders
should
be
undone
from
beginning
to
end
she
liked
to
be
courtesied
and
bowed
to
by
all
the
congregation
as
she
walked
up
the
little
barn
of
a
church
she
liked
to
change
a
laborer
medicine
fetched
from
the
doctor
and
substitute
a
prescription
of
her
own
if
she
had
only
been
more
haggard
and
less
majestic
those
who
had
glimpses
of
her
outward
life
might
have
said
she
was
a
tyrannical
griping
harridan
with
a
tongue
like
a
razor
no
one
said
exactly
that
but
they
never
said
anything
like
the
full
truth
about
her
or
divined
what
was
hidden
under
that
outward
life
a
woman
keen
sensibility
and
dread
which
lay
screened
behind
all
her
petty
habits
and
narrow
notions
as
some
quivering
thing
with
eyes
and
throbbing
heart
may
lie
crouching
behind
withered
rubbish
the
sensibility
and
dread
had
palpitated
all
the
faster
in
the
prospect
of
her
son
return
and
now
that
she
had
seen
him
she
said
to
herself
in
her
bitter
way
it
is
a
lucky
eel
that
escapes

the
best
happiness

chapter
ii
a
jolly
parson
of
the
good
old
stock
by
birth
a
gentleman
yet
homely
too
suiting
his
phrase
to
hodge
and
margery
whom
he
once
christened
and
has
married
since
a
little
lax
in
doctrine
and
in
life
not
thinking
god
was
captious
in
such
things
as
what
a
man
might
drink
on
holidays
but
holding
true
religion
was
to
do
as
you
be
done
by
which
could
never
mean
that
he
should
preach
three
sermons
in
a
week
harold
transome
did
not
choose
to
spend
the
whole
evening
with
his
mother
it
was
his
habit
to
compress
a
great
deal
of
effective
conversation
into
a
short
space
of
time
asking
rapidly
all
the
questions
he
wanted
to
get
answered
and
diluting
no
subject
with
irrelevancies
paraphrase
or
repetitions
he
volunteered
no
information
about
himself
and
his
past
life
at
smyrna
but
answered
pleasantly
enough
though
briefly
whenever
his
mother
asked
for
any
detail
he
was
evidently
as
to
his
palate
trying
red
pepper
to
everything
then
asking
if
there
were
any
relishing
sauces
in
the
house
and
when
hickes
brought
various
bottles
trying
several
finding
them
failures
and
finally
falling
back
from
his
plate
in
despair
yet
he
remained
saying
something
to
his
father
now
and
then
for
the
sake
of
being
kind
and
looking
on
with
a
pitying
shrug
as
he
saw
him
watch
hickes
cutting
his
food
transome
thought
with
some
bitterness
that
harold
showed
more
feeling
for
her
feeble
husband
who
had
never
cared
in
the
least
about
him
than
for
her
who
had
given
him
more
than
the
usual
share
of
mother
love
an
hour
after
dinner
harold
who
had
already
been
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
mother
said
i
shall
just
cross
the
park
to
the
parsonage
to
see
my
uncle
lingon
very
well
he
can
answer
more
questions
for
you
yes
said
harold
quite
deaf
to
the
innuendo
and
accepting
the
words
as
a
simple
statement
of
the
fact
i
want
to
hear
all
about
the
game
and
the
north
loamshire
hunt
i
fond
of
sport
we
had
a
great
deal
of
it
at
smyrna
and
it
keeps
down
my
fat
the
reverend
john
lingon
became
very
talkative
over
his
second
bottle
of
port
which
was
opened
on
his
nephew
arrival
he
was
not
curious
about
the
manners
of
smyrna
or
about
harold
experience
but
he
unbosomed
himself
very
freely
as
to
what
he
himself
liked
and
disliked
which
of
the
farmers
he
suspected
of
killing
the
foxes
what
game
he
had
bagged
that
very
morning
what
spot
he
would
recommend
as
a
new
cover
and
the
comparative
flatness
of
all
existing
sport
compared
with
under
which
old
england
had
been
prosperous
and
glorious
while
so
far
as
he
could
see
it
had
gained
little
by
the
abolition
of
a
practice
which
sharpened
the
faculties
of
men
gratified
the
instincts
of
the
fowl
and
carried
out
the
designs
of
heaven
in
its
admirable
device
of
spurs
from
these
main
topics
which
made
his
points
of
departure
and
return
he
rambled
easily
enough
at
any
new
suggestion
or
query
so
that
when
harold
got
home
at
a
late
hour
he
was
conscious
of
having
gathered
from
amidst
the
pompous
triviality
of
his
uncle
chat
some
impressions
which
were
of
practical
importance
among
the
dislikes
it
appeared
was
matthew
jermyn
a
fellow
with
a
scented
cambric
handkerchief
one
of
your
educated
fellows
a
foundling
who
got
his
latin
for
nothing
at
christ
hospital
one
of
your
upstarts
who
want
to
rank
with
gentlemen
and
think
they
do
it
with
kid
gloves
and
new
furniture
but
since
harold
meant
to
stand
for
the
county
lingon
was
equally
emphatic
as
to
the
necessity
of
his
not
quarrelling
with
jermyn
till
the
election
was
over
jermyn
must
be
his
agent
harold
must
wink
hard
till
he
found
himself
safely
returned
and
even
then
it
might
be
well
to
let
jermyn
drop
gently
and
raise
no
scandal
he
himself
had
no
quarrel
with
the
fellow
a
clergyman
should
have
no
quarrels
and
he
made
it
a
point
to
be
able
to
take
wine
with
any
man
he
met
at
table
and
as
to
the
estate
and
his
sister
going
too
much
by
jermyn
advice
he
never
meddled
with
business
it
was
not
his
duty
as
a
clergyman
that
he
considered
was
the
meaning
of
melchisedec
and
the
tithe
a
subject
into
which
he
had
gone
to
some
depth
thirty
years
ago
when
he
preached
the
visitation
sermon
the
discovery
that
harold
meant
to
stand
on
the
liberal
side
nay
that
he
boldly
declared
himself
a
radical
was
rather
startling
but
to
his
uncle
beatified
by
the
sipping
of
nothing
could
seem
highly
objectionable
provided
it
did
not
disturb
that
operation
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
he
had
brought
himself
to
see
that
anything
really
worthy
to
be
called
british
toryism
had
been
entirely
extinct
since
the
duke
of
wellington
and
sir
robert
peel
had
passed
the
catholic
emancipation
bill
that
whiggery
with
its
rights
of
man
stopping
short
at
householders
and
its
policy
of
pacifying
a
wild
beast
with
a
bite
was
a
ridiculous
monstrosity
that
therefore
since
an
honest
man
could
not
call
himself
a
tory
which
it
was
in
fact
as
impossible
to
be
now
as
to
fight
for
the
old
pretender
and
could
still
less
become
that
execrable
monstrosity
a
whig
there
remained
but
one
course
open
to
him
why
lad
if
the
world
was
turned
into
a
swamp
i
suppose
we
should
leave
off
shoes
and
stockings
and
walk
about
like
cranes
whence
it
followed
plainly
enough
that
in
these
hopeless
times
nothing
was
left
to
men
of
sense
and
good
family
but
to
retard
the
national
ruin
by
declaring
themselves
radicals
and
take
the
inevitable
process
of
changing
everything
out
of
the
hands
of
beggarly
demagogues
and
tradesmen
it
is
true
the
rector
was
helped
to
this
chain
of
reasoning
by
harold
remarks
but
he
soon
became
quite
ardent
in
asserting
the
conclusion
if
the
mob
ca
be
turned
back
a
man
of
family
must
try
and
head
the
mob
and
save
a
few
homes
and
hearths
and
keep
the
country
up
on
its
last
legs
as
long
as
he
can
and
you
a
man
of
family
my
lad
dash
it
you
a
lingon
whatever
else
you
may
be
and
i
stand
by
you
i
no
great
interest
i
a
poor
parson
i
been
forced
to
give
up
hunting
my
pointers
and
a
glass
of
good
wine
are
the
only
decencies
becoming
my
station
that
i
can
allow
myself
but
i
give
you
my
countenance
i
stick
to
you
as
my
nephew
there
no
need
for
me
to
change
sides
exactly
i
was
born
a
tory
and
i
shall
never
be
a
bishop
but
if
anybody
says
you
in
the
wrong
i
shall
say
nephew
is
in
the
right
he
has
turned
radical
to
save
his
country
if
william
pitt
had
been
living
now
he
have
done
the
same
for
what
did
he
say
when
he
was
dying
not
save
my
party
but
save
my
country
heaven
that
was
what
they
dinned
in
our
ears
about
peel
and
the
duke
and
now
i
turn
it
round
upon
them
they
shall
be
hoist
with
their
own
petard
yes
yes
i
stand
by
you
harold
did
not
feel
sure
that
his
uncle
would
thoroughly
retain
this
satisfactory
thread
of
argument
in
the
uninspired
hours
of
the
morning
but
the
old
gentleman
was
sure
to
take
the
facts
easily
in
the
end
and
there
was
no
fear
of
family
coolness
or
quarrelling
on
this
side
harold
was
glad
of
it
he
was
not
to
be
turned
aside
from
any
course
he
had
chosen
but
he
disliked
all
quarrelling
as
an
unpleasant
expenditure
of
energy
that
could
have
no
good
practical
result
he
was
at
once
active
and
luxurious
fond
of
mastery
and
enough
to
wish
that
every
one
about
him
should
like
his
mastery
not
caring
greatly
to
know
other
people
thoughts
and
ready
to
despise
them
as
blockheads
if
their
thoughts
differed
from
his
and
yet
solicitous
that
they
should
have
no
colorable
reason
for
slight
thoughts
about
the
blockheads
must
be
forced
to
respect
him
hence
in
proportion
as
he
foresaw
his
equals
in
the
neighborhood
would
be
indignant
with
him
for
his
political
choice
he
cared
keenly
about
making
a
good
figure
before
them
in
every
other
way
his
conduct
as
a
landholder
was
to
be
judicious
his
establishment
was
to
be
kept
up
generously
his
imbecile
father
treated
with
careful
regard
his
family
relations
entirely
without
scandal
he
knew
that
affairs
had
been
unpleasant
in
his
youth
that
there
had
been
ugly
lawsuits
and
that
his
scapegrace
brother
durfey
had
helped
to
lower
still
farther
the
depressed
condition
of
the
family
all
this
must
be
retrieved
now
that
events
had
made
harold
the
head
of
the
transome
name
jermyn
must
be
used
for
the
election
and
after
that
if
he
must
be
got
rid
of
it
would
be
well
to
shake
him
loose
quietly
his
uncle
was
probably
right
on
both
these
points
but
harold
expectation
that
he
should
want
to
get
rid
of
jermyn
was
founded
on
other
reasons
than
his
scented
handkerchief
and
his
latin
if
the
lawyer
had
been
presuming
on
transome
ignorance
as
a
woman
and
on
the
stupid
rakishness
of
the
original
heir
the
new
heir
would
prove
to
him
that
he
had
calculated
rashly
otherwise
harold
had
no
prejudice
against
him
in
his
boyhood
and
youth
he
had
seen
jermyn
frequenting
transome
court
but
had
regarded
him
with
that
total
indifference
with
which
youngsters
are
apt
to
view
those
who
neither
deny
them
pleasure
nor
give
them
any
jermyn
used
to
smile
at
him
and
speak
to
him
affably
but
harold
half
proud
half
shy
got
away
from
such
patronage
as
soon
as
possible
he
knew
jermyn
was
a
man
of
business
his
father
his
uncle
and
sir
maximus
debarry
did
not
regard
him
as
a
gentleman
and
their
equal
he
had
known
no
evil
of
the
man
but
he
saw
now
that
if
he
were
really
a
covetous
upstart
there
had
been
a
temptation
for
him
in
the
management
of
the
transome
affairs
and
it
was
clear
that
the
estate
was
in
a
bad
condition
when
jermyn
was
ushered
into
the
the
next
morning
harold
found
him
surprisingly
little
altered
by
the
fifteen
years
he
was
gray
but
still
remarkably
handsome
fat
but
tall
enough
to
bear
that
trial
to
man
dignity
there
was
as
strong
a
suggestion
of
toilette
about
him
as
if
he
had
been
instead
of
nearly
sixty
he
chose
always
to
dress
in
black
and
was
especially
addicted
to
black
satin
waistcoats
which
carried
out
the
general
sleekness
of
his
appearance
and
this
together
with
his
white
fat
but
hands
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
rubbing
gently
on
his
entrance
into
a
room
gave
him
very
much
the
air
of
a
physician
harold
remembered
with
some
amusement
his
uncle
dislike
of
those
conspicuous
hands
but
as
his
own
were
soft
and
dimpled
and
as
he
too
was
given
to
the
innocent
practice
of
rubbing
those
members
his
suspicions
were
not
yet
deepened
i
congratulate
you
transome
said
jermyn
with
a
soft
and
deferential
smile
all
the
more
he
added
turning
toward
harold
now
i
have
the
pleasure
of
actually
seeing
your
son
i
am
glad
to
perceive
that
an
eastern
climate
has
not
been
unfavorable
to
him
no
said
harold
shaking
jermyn
hand
carelessly
and
speaking
with
more
than
his
usual
brusqueness
the
question
is
whether
the
english
climate
will
agree
with
me
it
deuced
shifting
and
damp
and
as
for
the
food
it
would
be
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
for
this
country
if
the
southern
cooks
would
change
their
religion
get
persecuted
and
fly
to
england
as
the
old
did
there
are
plenty
of
foreign
cooks
for
those
who
are
rich
enough
to
pay
for
them
i
suppose
said
transome
but
they
are
unpleasant
people
to
have
about
one
house
gad
i
do
think
so
said
harold
the
old
servants
are
sure
to
quarrel
with
them
that
no
concern
of
mine
the
old
servants
will
have
to
put
up
with
my
man
dominic
who
will
show
them
how
to
cook
and
do
everything
else
in
a
way
that
will
rather
astonish
them
old
people
are
not
so
easily
taught
to
change
all
their
ways
harold
well
they
can
give
up
and
watch
the
young
ones
said
harold
thinking
only
at
that
moment
of
old
hickes
and
dominic
but
his
mother
was
not
thinking
of
them
only
you
have
a
valuable
servant
it
seems
said
jermyn
who
understood
transome
better
than
her
son
did
and
wished
to
smoothen
the
current
of
their
dialogue
oh
one
of
those
wonderful
southern
fellows
that
make
one
life
easy
he
of
no
country
in
particular
i
do
know
whether
he
most
of
a
jew
a
greek
an
italian
or
a
spaniard
he
speaks
five
or
six
languages
one
as
well
as
another
he
cook
valet
and
secretary
all
in
one
and
what
more
he
an
affectionate
fellow
i
can
trust
to
his
attachment
that
a
sort
of
human
specimen
that
does
grow
here
in
england
i
fancy
i
should
have
been
badly
off
if
i
could
not
have
brought
dominic
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
such
slight
talk
as
this
going
on
each
of
the
party
was
preoccupied
and
uneasy
harold
mind
was
busy
constructing
probabilities
about
what
he
should
discover
of
mismanagement
or
dubious
application
of
funds
and
the
sort
of
he
must
in
the
worst
case
exercise
in
order
to
use
the
man
as
long
as
he
wanted
him
jermyn
was
closely
observing
harold
with
an
unpleasant
sense
that
there
was
an
expression
of
acuteness
and
determination
about
him
which
would
make
him
formidable
he
would
certainly
have
preferred
at
that
moment
that
there
had
been
no
second
heir
of
the
transome
name
to
come
back
upon
him
from
the
east
transome
was
not
observing
the
two
men
rather
her
hands
were
cold
and
her
whole
person
shaken
by
their
presence
she
seemed
to
hear
and
see
what
they
said
and
did
with
preternatural
acuteness
and
yet
she
was
also
seeing
and
hearing
what
had
been
said
and
done
many
years
before
and
feeling
a
dim
terror
about
the
future
there
were
piteous
sensibilities
in
this
faded
woman
who
years
ago
in
the
splendor
of
her
bloom
had
been
imperious
to
one
of
these
men
and
had
rapturously
pressed
the
other
as
an
infant
to
her
bosom
and
now
knew
that
she
was
of
little
consequence
to
either
of
them
well
what
are
the
prospects
about
election
said
harold
as
the
breakfast
was
advancing
there
are
two
whigs
and
one
conservative
likely
to
be
in
the
field
i
know
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
chances
jermyn
had
a
copious
supply
of
words
which
often
led
him
into
periphrase
but
he
cultivated
a
hesitating
stammer
which
with
a
handsome
impassiveness
of
face
except
when
he
was
smiling
at
a
woman
or
when
the
latent
savageness
of
his
nature
was
thoroughly
roused
he
had
found
useful
in
many
relations
especially
in
business
no
one
could
have
found
out
that
he
was
not
at
his
ease
my
opinion
he
replied
is
in
a
state
of
balance
at
present
this
division
of
the
county
you
are
aware
contains
one
manufacturing
town
of
the
first
magnitude
and
several
smaller
ones
the
manufacturing
interest
is
widely
dispersed
so
far
a
there
is
a
presumption
a
in
favor
of
the
two
liberal
candidates
still
with
a
careful
canvass
of
the
agricultural
districts
such
as
those
we
have
round
us
at
treby
magna
i
think
a
the
auguries
a
would
not
be
unfavorable
to
the
return
of
a
conservative
a
fourth
candidate
of
good
position
who
should
coalesce
with
debarry
a
here
jermyn
hesitated
for
the
third
time
and
harold
broke
in
that
will
not
be
my
line
of
action
so
we
need
not
discuss
it
if
i
put
up
it
will
be
as
a
radical
and
i
fancy
in
any
county
that
would
return
whigs
there
would
be
plenty
of
voters
to
be
combed
off
by
a
radical
who
offered
himself
with
good
pretensions
there
was
the
slightest
possible
quiver
discernible
across
face
otherwise
he
sat
as
he
had
done
before
with
his
eyes
fixed
abstractedly
on
the
frill
of
a
ham
before
him
and
his
hand
trifling
with
his
fork
he
did
not
answer
immediately
but
when
he
did
he
looked
round
steadily
at
harold
i
delighted
to
perceive
that
you
have
kept
yourself
so
thoroughly
acquainted
with
english
politics
oh
of
course
said
harold
impatiently
i
aware
how
things
have
been
going
on
in
england
i
always
meant
to
come
back
ultimately
i
suppose
i
know
the
state
of
europe
as
well
as
if
i
been
stationary
at
little
treby
for
the
last
fifteen
years
if
a
man
goes
to
the
east
people
seem
to
think
he
gets
turned
into
something
like
the
calender
in
the
nights
yet
i
should
think
there
are
some
things
which
people
who
have
been
stationary
at
little
treby
could
tell
you
harold
said
transome
it
did
not
signify
about
your
holding
radical
opinions
at
smyrna
but
you
seem
not
to
imagine
how
your
putting
up
as
a
radical
will
affect
your
position
here
and
the
position
of
your
family
no
one
will
visit
you
and
then
the
sort
of
people
who
will
support
you
you
really
have
no
idea
what
an
impression
it
conveys
when
you
say
you
are
a
radical
there
are
none
of
our
equals
who
will
not
feel
that
you
have
disgraced
yourself
pooh
said
harold
rising
and
walking
along
the
room
but
transome
went
on
with
growing
anger
in
her
voice
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
owes
something
to
his
birth
and
station
and
has
no
right
to
take
up
this
notion
or
other
just
as
it
suits
his
fancy
still
less
to
work
at
the
overthrow
of
his
class
that
was
what
every
one
said
of
lord
grey
and
my
family
at
least
is
as
good
as
lord
grey
you
have
wealth
now
and
might
distinguish
yourself
in
the
county
and
if
you
had
been
true
to
your
colors
as
a
gentleman
you
would
have
had
all
the
greater
opportunity
because
the
times
are
so
bad
the
debarrys
and
lord
wyvern
would
have
set
all
the
more
store
by
you
for
my
part
i
conceive
what
good
you
propose
to
yourself
i
only
entreat
you
to
think
again
before
you
take
any
decided
step
mother
said
harold
not
angrily
or
with
any
raising
of
his
voice
but
in
a
quick
impatient
manner
as
if
the
scene
must
be
got
through
as
quickly
as
possible
it
is
natural
that
you
should
think
in
this
way
women
very
properly
do
change
their
views
but
keep
to
the
notions
in
which
they
have
been
brought
up
it
does
signify
what
they
think
they
are
not
called
upon
to
judge
or
to
act
you
must
leave
me
to
take
my
own
course
in
these
matters
which
properly
belong
to
men
beyond
that
i
will
gratify
any
wish
you
may
choose
to
mention
you
shall
have
a
new
carriage
and
a
pair
of
bays
all
to
yourself
you
shall
have
the
house
done
up
in
style
and
i
am
not
thinking
of
marrying
but
let
us
understand
that
there
shall
be
no
further
collision
between
us
on
subjects
on
which
i
must
be
master
of
my
own
actions
and
you
will
put
the
crown
to
the
mortifications
of
my
life
harold
i
do
know
who
would
be
a
mother
if
she
could
foresee
what
a
slight
thing
she
will
be
to
her
son
when
she
is
old
transome
here
walked
out
of
the
room
by
the
nearest
way
the
glass
door
open
toward
the
terrace
jermyn
had
risen
too
and
his
hands
were
on
the
back
of
his
chair
he
looked
quite
impassive
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
seen
transome
angry
but
now
for
the
first
time
he
thought
the
outburst
of
her
temper
would
be
useful
to
him
she
poor
woman
knew
quite
well
that
she
had
been
unwise
and
that
she
had
been
making
herself
disagreeable
to
harold
to
no
purpose
but
half
the
sorrows
of
women
would
be
averted
if
they
could
repress
the
speech
they
know
to
be
useless
nay
the
speech
they
have
resolved
not
to
utter
harold
continued
his
walking
a
moment
longer
and
then
said
to
jermyn
you
smoke
no
i
always
defer
to
the
ladies
jermyn
is
peculiarly
sensitive
in
such
matters
and
does
like
tobacco
harold
who
underneath
all
the
tendencies
which
had
made
him
a
liberal
had
intense
personal
pride
thought
confound
the
fellow
with
his
jermyn
does
he
think
we
are
on
a
footing
for
me
to
know
anything
about
his
wife
well
i
took
my
hookah
before
breakfast
he
said
aloud
so
if
you
like
we
go
into
the
library
my
father
never
gets
up
till
midday
i
find
sit
down
sit
down
said
harold
as
they
entered
the
handsome
spacious
library
but
he
himself
continued
to
stand
before
a
map
of
the
county
which
he
had
opened
from
a
series
of
rollers
occupying
a
compartment
among
the
bookshelves
the
first
question
jermyn
now
you
know
my
intentions
is
whether
you
will
undertake
to
be
my
agent
in
this
election
and
help
me
through
there
no
time
to
be
lost
and
i
do
want
to
lose
my
chance
as
i
may
not
have
another
for
seven
years
i
understand
he
went
on
flashing
a
look
straight
at
jermyn
that
you
have
not
taken
any
conspicuous
course
in
politics
and
i
know
that
labron
is
agent
for
the
debarrys
oh
a
my
dear
sir
a
man
necessarily
has
his
political
convictions
but
of
what
use
is
it
for
a
professional
man
a
of
some
education
to
talk
of
them
in
a
little
country
town
there
really
is
no
comprehension
of
public
questions
in
such
places
party
feeling
indeed
was
quite
asleep
here
before
the
agitation
about
the
catholic
relief
bill
it
is
true
that
i
concurred
with
our
incumbent
in
getting
up
a
petition
against
the
reform
bill
but
i
did
not
state
my
reasons
the
weak
points
in
that
bill
are
a
too
palpable
and
i
fancy
you
and
i
should
not
differ
much
on
that
head
the
fact
is
when
i
knew
that
you
were
to
come
back
to
us
i
kept
myself
in
reserve
though
i
was
much
pressed
by
the
friends
of
sir
james
clement
the
ministerial
candidate
who
is
however
you
will
act
for
me
that
settled
said
harold
certainly
said
jermyn
inwardly
irritated
by
harold
rapid
manner
of
cutting
him
short
which
of
the
liberal
candidates
as
they
call
themselves
has
the
better
chance
eh
i
was
going
to
observe
that
sir
james
clement
has
not
so
good
a
chance
as
garstin
supposing
that
a
third
liberal
candidate
presents
himself
there
are
two
senses
in
which
a
politician
can
be
liberal
here
jermyn
smiled
sir
james
clement
is
a
poor
baronet
hoping
for
an
appointment
and
ca
be
expected
to
be
liberal
in
that
wider
sense
which
commands
majorities
i
wish
this
man
were
not
so
much
of
a
talker
thought
harold
bore
me
we
shall
see
he
said
aloud
what
can
be
done
in
the
way
of
combination
i
come
down
to
your
office
after
one
if
it
will
suit
you
perfectly
ah
and
you
have
all
the
lists
and
papers
and
necessary
information
ready
for
me
there
i
must
get
up
a
dinner
for
the
tenants
and
we
can
invite
whom
we
like
besides
the
tenants
just
now
i
going
over
one
of
the
farms
on
hand
with
the
bailiff
by
the
way
that
a
desperately
bad
business
having
three
farms
unlet
how
comes
that
about
eh
that
is
precisely
what
i
wanted
to
say
a
few
words
about
to
you
you
have
observed
already
how
strongly
transome
takes
certain
things
to
heart
you
can
imagine
that
she
has
been
severely
tried
in
many
ways
transome
want
of
health
durfey
habits
a
yes
yes
she
is
a
woman
for
whom
i
naturally
entertain
the
highest
respect
and
she
has
had
hardly
any
gratification
for
many
years
except
the
sense
of
having
affairs
to
a
certain
extent
in
her
own
hands
she
objects
to
changes
she
will
not
have
a
new
style
of
tenants
she
likes
the
old
stock
of
farmers
who
milk
their
own
cows
and
send
their
younger
daughters
out
to
service
all
this
makes
it
difficult
to
do
the
best
with
the
estate
i
am
aware
things
are
not
as
they
ought
to
be
for
in
point
of
fact
improved
agricultural
management
is
a
matter
in
which
i
take
considerable
interest
and
the
farm
which
i
myself
hold
on
the
estate
you
will
see
i
think
to
be
in
a
superior
condition
but
transome
is
a
woman
of
strong
feeling
and
i
would
urge
you
my
dear
sir
to
make
the
changes
which
you
have
but
which
i
had
not
the
right
to
insist
on
as
little
painful
to
her
as
possible
i
shall
know
what
to
do
sir
never
fear
said
harold
much
offended
you
will
pardon
i
hope
a
perhaps
undue
freedom
of
suggestion
from
a
man
of
my
age
who
has
been
so
long
in
a
close
connection
with
the
family
affairs
a
i
have
never
considered
that
connection
simply
in
a
light
of
business
a
damn
him
i
soon
let
him
know
that
do
thought
harold
but
in
proportion
as
he
found
jermyn
manners
annoying
he
felt
the
necessity
of
controlling
himself
he
despised
all
persons
who
defeated
their
own
projects
by
the
indulgence
of
momentary
impulses
i
understand
i
understand
he
said
aloud
you
had
more
awkward
business
on
your
hands
than
usually
falls
to
the
share
of
a
family
lawyer
we
shall
set
everything
right
by
degrees
but
now
as
to
the
canvassing
i
made
arrangements
with
a
man
in
london
who
understands
these
matters
thoroughly
a
solicitor
of
course
he
has
carried
no
end
of
men
into
parliament
i
engage
him
to
meet
us
at
duffield
say
when
the
conversation
after
this
was
driven
carefully
clear
of
all
angles
and
ended
with
determined
amicableness
when
harold
in
his
ride
an
hour
or
two
afterward
encountered
his
uncle
shouldering
a
gun
and
followed
by
one
black
and
one
pointer
his
muscular
person
with
its
red
eagle
face
set
off
by
a
velveteen
jacket
and
leather
leggings
lingon
first
question
was
well
lad
how
have
you
got
on
with
jermyn
oh
i
do
think
i
shall
like
the
fellow
he
a
sort
of
amateur
gentleman
but
i
must
make
use
of
him
i
expect
whatever
i
get
out
of
him
will
only
be
something
short
of
fair
pay
for
what
he
has
got
out
of
us
but
i
shall
see
ay
ay
use
his
gun
to
bring
down
your
game
and
after
that
beat
the
thief
with
the
butt
end
that
wisdom
and
justice
and
pleasure
all
in
one
talking
between
ourselves
as
uncle
and
nephew
but
i
say
harold
i
was
going
to
tell
you
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
this
is
rather
a
nasty
business
your
calling
yourself
a
radical
i
been
turning
it
over
in
speeches
but
it
looks
awkward
it
not
what
people
are
used
to
it
wants
a
good
deal
of
latin
to
make
it
go
down
i
shall
be
worried
about
it
at
the
sessions
and
i
can
think
of
nothing
neat
enough
to
carry
about
in
my
pocket
by
way
of
answer
nonsense
uncle
i
remember
what
a
good
speechifier
you
always
were
you
never
be
at
a
loss
you
only
want
a
few
more
evenings
to
think
of
it
but
you
not
be
attacking
the
church
and
the
institutions
of
the
country
you
not
be
going
those
lengths
you
keep
up
the
bulwarks
and
so
on
eh
no
i
sha
attack
the
church
only
the
incomes
of
the
bishops
perhaps
to
make
them
eke
out
the
incomes
of
the
poor
clergy
well
well
i
have
no
objection
to
that
nobody
likes
our
bishop
all
greek
and
greediness
too
proud
to
dine
with
his
own
father
you
may
pepper
the
bishops
a
little
but
you
respect
the
constitution
handed
down
and
you
rally
round
the
throne
and
the
king
god
bless
him
and
the
usual
toasts
eh
of
course
of
course
i
am
a
radical
only
in
rooting
out
abuses
that
the
word
i
wanted
my
lad
said
the
vicar
slapping
knee
that
a
spool
to
wind
a
speech
on
abuses
is
the
very
word
and
if
anybody
shows
himself
offended
he
put
the
cap
on
for
himself
i
remove
the
rotten
timbers
said
harold
inwardly
amused
and
substitute
fresh
oak
that
all
well
done
my
boy
by
george
you
be
a
speaker
but
i
say
harold
i
hope
you
got
a
little
latin
left
this
young
debarry
is
a
tremendous
fellow
at
the
classics
and
walks
on
stilts
to
any
length
he
one
of
the
new
conservatives
old
sir
maximus
does
understand
him
at
all
that
wo
do
at
the
hustings
said
harold
he
get
knocked
off
his
stilts
pretty
quickly
there
bless
me
it
astonishing
how
well
you
up
in
the
affairs
of
the
country
my
boy
but
rub
up
a
few
quotations
turpe
bonis
decebat
and
that
sort
of
thing
just
to
show
debarry
what
you
could
do
if
you
liked
but
you
want
to
ride
on
yes
i
have
an
appointment
at
treby
he
a
cleverish
chap
muttered
the
vicar
as
harold
rode
away
when
he
had
plenty
of
english
exercise
and
brought
out
his
knuckle
a
bit
he
be
a
lingon
again
as
he
used
to
be
i
must
go
and
see
how
arabella
takes
his
being
a
radical
it
a
little
awkward
but
a
clergyman
must
keep
peace
in
a
family
confound
it
i
not
bound
to
love
toryism
better
than
my
own
flesh
and
blood
and
the
manor
i
shoot
over
that
a
heathenish
sort
of
thing
as
if
providence
could
take
care
of
the
country
without
my
quarrelling
with
my
own
sister

chapter
iii
was
town
yet
country
too
you
felt
the
warmth
of
clustering
houses
in
the
wintry
time
supped
with
a
friend
and
went
by
lantern
home
yet
from
your
chamber
window
you
could
hear
the
tiny
bleat
of
lambs
or
see
the
children
bend
beside
the
hedgerow
banks
to
pluck
the
primroses
treby
magna
on
which
the
reform
bill
had
thrust
the
new
honor
of
being
a
had
been
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
quite
a
typical
old
lying
in
pleasant
sleepiness
among
green
pastures
with
a
river
meandering
through
them
its
principal
street
had
various
handsome
and
brick
houses
with
walled
gardens
behind
them
and
at
the
end
where
it
widened
into
the
there
was
the
cheerful
front
of
that
excellent
inn
the
marquis
of
granby
where
the
farmers
put
up
their
gigs
not
only
on
fair
and
market
days
but
on
exceptional
sundays
when
they
came
to
church
and
the
church
was
one
of
those
fine
old
english
structures
worth
travelling
to
see
standing
in
a
broad
churchyard
with
a
line
of
solemn
beside
it
and
lifting
a
majestic
tower
and
spire
far
above
the
roofs
of
the
town
it
was
not
large
enough
to
hold
all
the
parishioners
of
a
parish
which
stretched
over
distant
villages
and
hamlets
but
then
they
were
never
so
unreasonable
as
to
wish
to
be
all
in
at
once
and
had
never
complained
that
the
space
of
a
large
was
taken
up
by
the
tombs
of
the
debarrys
and
shut
in
by
a
handsome
iron
screen
for
when
the
black
benedictines
ceased
to
pray
and
chant
in
this
church
when
the
blessed
virgin
and
gregory
were
expelled
the
debarrys
as
lords
of
the
manor
naturally
came
next
to
providence
and
took
the
place
of
the
saints
long
before
that
time
indeed
there
had
been
a
sir
maximus
debarry
who
had
been
at
the
fortifying
of
the
old
castle
which
now
stood
in
ruins
in
the
midst
of
the
green
pastures
and
with
its
sheltering
wall
toward
the
north
made
an
excellent
strawyard
for
the
pigs
of
wace
brewers
of
the
celebrated
treby
beer
wace
did
not
stand
alone
in
the
town
as
prosperous
traders
on
a
large
scale
to
say
nothing
of
those
who
had
retired
from
business
and
in
no
country
town
of
the
same
small
size
as
treby
was
there
a
larger
proportion
of
families
who
had
handsome
sets
of
china
without
handles
hereditary
and
large
silver
ladles
with
a
queen
anne
guinea
in
the
centre
such
people
naturally
took
tea
and
supped
together
frequently
and
as
there
was
no
professional
man
or
tradesman
in
treby
who
was
not
connected
by
business
if
not
by
blood
with
the
farmers
of
the
district
the
richer
sort
of
these
were
much
invited
and
gave
invitations
in
their
turn
they
played
at
whist
ate
and
drank
generously
praised
pitt
and
the
war
as
keeping
up
prices
and
religion
and
were
very
humorous
about
each
other
property
having
much
the
same
coy
pleasure
in
allusions
to
their
secret
ability
to
purchase
as
blushing
lasses
sometimes
have
in
jokes
about
their
secret
preferences
the
rector
was
always
of
the
debarry
family
associated
only
with
county
people
and
was
much
respected
for
his
affability
a
clergyman
who
would
have
taken
tea
with
the
townspeople
would
have
given
a
dangerous
shock
to
the
mind
of
a
treby
churchman
such
was
the
grazing
brewing
life
of
treby
magna
until
there
befell
new
conditions
complicating
its
relation
with
the
rest
of
the
world
and
gradually
awakening
in
it
that
higher
consciousness
which
is
known
to
bring
higher
pains
first
came
the
canal
next
the
working
of
the
at
sproxton
two
miles
off
the
town
and
thirdly
the
discovery
of
a
saline
spring
which
suggested
to
a
too
constructive
brain
the
possibility
of
turning
treby
magna
into
a
fashionable
so
daring
an
idea
was
not
originated
by
a
native
trebian
but
by
a
young
lawyer
who
came
from
a
distance
knew
the
dictionary
by
heart
and
was
probably
an
illegitimate
son
of
somebody
or
other
the
idea
although
it
promised
an
increase
of
wealth
to
the
town
was
not
well
received
at
first
ladies
objected
to
seeing
objects
drawn
about
in
the
doctor
foresaw
the
advent
of
unsound
practitioners
and
most
retail
tradesmen
concurred
with
him
that
new
doings
were
usually
for
the
advantage
of
new
people
the
more
unanswerable
reasoners
urged
that
treby
had
prospered
without
baths
and
it
was
yet
to
be
seen
how
it
would
prosper
with
them
while
a
report
that
the
proposed
name
for
them
was
bethesda
spa
threatened
to
give
the
whole
affair
a
blasphemous
aspect
even
sir
maximus
debarry
who
was
to
have
an
unprecedented
return
for
the
thousands
he
would
lay
out
on
a
and
hotel
regarded
the
thing
as
a
little
too
new
and
held
back
for
some
time
but
the
persuasive
powers
of
the
young
lawyer
matthew
jermyn
together
with
the
opportune
opening
of
a
triumphed
at
last
the
handsome
buildings
were
erected
an
excellent
and
descriptive
cards
surmounted
by
vignettes
were
printed
and
treby
magna
became
conscious
of
certain
facts
in
its
own
history
of
which
it
had
previously
been
in
contented
ignorance
but
it
was
all
in
vain
the
spa
for
some
mysterious
reason
did
not
succeed
some
attributed
the
failure
to
the
and
the
canal
others
to
the
peace
which
had
had
ruinous
effects
on
the
country
and
others
who
disliked
jermyn
to
the
original
folly
of
the
plan
among
these
last
was
sir
maximus
himself
who
never
forgave
the
too
persuasive
attorney
it
was
jermyn
fault
not
only
that
a
useless
hotel
had
been
built
but
that
he
sir
maximus
being
straitened
for
money
had
at
last
let
the
building
with
the
adjacent
land
lying
on
the
river
on
a
long
lease
on
the
supposition
that
it
was
to
be
turned
into
a
tape
manufactory
a
bitter
thing
to
any
gentleman
and
especially
to
the
representative
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
england
in
this
way
it
happened
that
treby
magna
gradually
passed
from
being
simply
a
respectable
market
town
the
heart
of
a
great
rural
district
where
the
trade
was
only
such
as
had
close
relations
with
the
local
landed
interest
and
took
on
the
more
complex
life
brought
by
mines
and
manufactures
which
belong
more
directly
to
the
great
circulating
system
of
the
nation
than
to
the
local
system
to
which
they
had
been
superadded
and
in
this
way
it
was
that
trebian
dissent
gradually
altered
its
character
formerly
it
had
been
of
a
quiescent
kind
represented
architecturally
by
a
small
venerable
chapel
built
by
presbyterians
but
long
occupied
by
a
sparse
congregation
of
independents
who
were
as
little
moved
by
doctrinal
zeal
as
their
neighbors
and
did
not
feel
themselves
deficient
in
religious
liberty
inasmuch
as
they
were
not
hindered
from
occasionally
slumbering
in
their
pews
and
were
not
obliged
to
go
regularly
to
the
weekly
but
when
and
made
new
hamlets
that
threatened
to
spread
up
to
the
very
town
when
the
came
with
their
inspectors
and
the
independent
chapel
began
to
be
filled
with
eager
men
and
women
to
whom
the
exceptional
possession
of
religious
truth
was
the
condition
which
reconciled
them
to
a
meagre
existence
and
made
them
feel
in
secure
alliance
with
the
unseen
but
supreme
rule
of
a
world
in
which
their
own
visible
part
was
small
there
were
dissenters
in
treby
now
who
could
not
be
regarded
by
the
church
people
in
the
light
of
old
neighbors
to
whom
the
habit
of
going
to
chapel
was
an
innocent
unenviable
inheritance
along
with
a
particular
house
and
garden
a
or
a
grocery
business
dissenters
who
in
their
turn
without
meaning
to
be
in
the
least
abusive
spoke
of
the
rector
as
a
blind
leader
of
the
blind
and
dissent
was
not
the
only
thing
that
the
times
had
altered
prices
had
fallen
had
risen
rent
and
tithe
were
not
elastic
enough
and
the
farmer
fat
sorrow
had
become
lean
he
began
to
speculate
on
causes
and
to
trace
things
back
to
that
causeless
mystery
the
cessation
of
notes
thus
when
political
agitation
swept
in
a
current
through
the
country
treby
magna
was
prepared
to
vibrate
the
catholic
emancipation
bill
opened
the
eyes
of
neighbors
and
made
them
aware
how
very
injurious
they
were
to
each
other
and
to
the
welfare
of
mankind
generally
tiliot
the
church
knew
now
that
nuttwood
the
obliging
grocer
was
one
of
those
dissenters
deists
socinians
papists
and
radicals
who
were
in
league
to
destroy
the
constitution
a
retired
old
london
tradesman
who
was
believed
to
understand
politics
said
that
thinking
people
must
wish
george
iii
were
alive
again
in
all
his
early
vigor
of
mind
and
even
the
farmers
became
less
materialistic
in
their
view
of
causes
and
referred
much
to
the
agency
of
the
devil
and
the
irish
romans
the
rector
the
reverend
augustus
debarry
really
a
fine
specimen
of
the
aristocratic
clergyman
preaching
short
sermons
understanding
business
and
acting
liberally
about
his
tithe
had
never
before
found
himself
in
collision
with
dissenters
but
now
he
began
to
feel
that
these
people
were
a
nuisance
in
the
parish
that
his
brother
sir
maximus
must
take
care
lest
they
should
get
land
to
build
more
chapels
and
that
it
might
not
have
been
a
bad
thing
if
the
law
had
furnished
him
as
a
magistrate
with
a
power
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
political
sermons
of
the
independent
preacher
which
in
their
way
were
as
pernicious
sources
of
intoxication
as
the
beerhouses
the
dissenters
on
their
side
were
not
disposed
to
sacrifice
the
cause
of
truth
and
freedom
to
a
temporizing
mildness
of
language
but
they
defended
themselves
from
the
charge
of
religious
indifference
and
solemnly
disclaimed
any
lax
expectations
that
catholics
were
likely
to
be
saved
urging
on
the
contrary
that
they
were
not
too
hopeful
about
protestants
who
adhered
to
a
bloated
and
worldly
prelacy
thus
treby
magna
which
had
lived
quietly
through
the
great
earthquakes
of
the
french
revolution
and
the
napoleonic
wars
which
had
remained
unmoved
by
the
rights
of
man
and
saw
little
in
cobbett
weekly
register
except
that
he
held
eccentric
views
about
potatoes
began
at
last
to
know
the
higher
pains
of
a
dim
political
consciousness
and
the
development
had
been
greatly
helped
by
the
recent
agitation
about
the
reform
bill
tory
whig
and
radical
did
not
perhaps
become
clearer
in
their
definition
of
each
other
but
the
names
seemed
to
acquire
so
strong
a
stamp
of
honor
or
infamy
that
definitions
would
only
have
weakened
the
impression
as
to
the
short
and
easy
method
of
judging
opinions
by
the
personal
character
of
those
who
held
them
it
was
liable
to
be
much
frustrated
in
treby
it
so
happened
in
that
particular
town
that
the
reformers
were
not
all
of
them
patriots
or
ardent
lovers
of
justice
indeed
one
of
them
in
the
very
midst
of
the
agitation
was
detected
in
using
unequal
scales
a
fact
to
which
many
tories
pointed
with
disgust
as
showing
plainly
enough
without
further
argument
that
the
cry
for
a
change
in
the
representative
system
was
hollow
trickery
again
the
tories
were
far
from
being
all
oppressors
disposed
to
grind
down
the
working
classes
into
serfdom
and
it
was
undeniable
that
the
inspector
at
the
tape
manufactory
who
spoke
with
much
eloquence
on
the
extension
of
the
suffrage
was
a
more
tyrannical
personage
than
wace
whose
chief
political
tenet
was
that
it
was
all
nonsense
to
give
men
votes
when
they
had
no
stake
in
the
country
on
the
other
hand
there
were
some
tories
who
gave
themselves
a
great
deal
of
leisure
to
abuse
hypocrites
radicals
dissenters
and
atheism
generally
but
whose
inflamed
faces
theistic
swearing
and
frankness
in
expressing
a
wish
to
borrow
certainly
did
not
mark
them
out
strongly
as
holding
opinions
likely
to
save
society
the
reformers
had
triumphed
it
was
clear
that
the
wheels
were
going
whither
they
were
pulling
and
they
were
in
fine
spirits
for
exertion
but
if
they
were
pulling
toward
the
country
ruin
there
was
the
more
need
for
others
to
hang
on
behind
and
get
the
wheels
to
stick
if
possible
in
treby
as
elsewhere
people
were
told
they
must
rally
at
the
coming
election
but
there
was
now
a
large
number
of
waverers
men
of
flexible
practical
minds
who
were
not
such
bigots
as
to
cling
to
any
views
when
a
good
tangible
reason
could
be
urged
against
them
while
some
regarded
it
as
the
most
neighborly
thing
to
hold
a
little
with
both
sides
and
were
not
sure
that
they
should
rally
or
vote
at
all
it
seemed
an
invidious
thing
to
vote
for
one
gentleman
rather
than
another
these
social
changes
in
treby
parish
are
comparatively
public
matters
and
this
history
is
chiefly
concerned
with
the
private
lot
of
a
few
men
and
women
but
there
is
no
private
life
which
has
not
been
determined
by
a
wider
public
life
from
the
time
when
the
primeval
milkmaid
had
to
wander
with
the
wanderings
of
her
clan
because
the
cow
she
milked
was
one
of
a
herd
which
had
made
the
pastures
bare
even
in
that
conservatory
existence
where
the
fair
camellia
is
sighed
for
by
the
noble
young
neither
of
them
needing
to
care
about
the
frost
or
rain
outside
there
is
a
nether
apparatus
of
hot
water
pipes
liable
to
cool
down
on
a
strike
of
the
gardeners
or
a
scarcity
of
coal
and
the
lives
we
are
about
to
look
back
upon
do
not
belong
to
those
conservatory
species
they
are
rooted
in
the
common
earth
having
to
endure
all
the
ordinary
chances
of
past
and
present
weather
as
to
the
weather
of
the
zadkiel
of
that
time
had
predicted
that
the
electrical
condition

in
the
political
hemisphere
would
produce
unusual
perturbations
in
organic
existence
and
he
would
perhaps
have
seen
a
fulfillment
of
his
remarkable
prophecy
in
that
mutual
influence
of
dissimilar
destinies
which
we
shall
see
gradually
unfolding
itself
for
if
the
mixed
political
conditions
of
treby

had
not
been
acted
on
by
the
passing
of

reform
bill

transome
would
not

himself
as

matthew
jermyn
would
not
have
been
on
affable
terms
with
a
dissenting
preacher
and
his
flock
and
the
venerable
town
would
not
have
been
placarded
with
handbills
more
or
less
complimentary
and
retrospective
conditions
in
this
case
essential
to
the
where
and
the
what
without
which
as
the
learned
know
there
can
be
no
event
whatever
for
example
it
was
through
these
conditions
that
a
young
man
named
felix
holt
made
a
considerable
difference
in
the
life
of
harold
transome
though
nature
and
fortune
seemed
to
have
done
what
they
could
to
keep
the
lots
of
the
two
men
quite
aloof
from
each
other
felix
was
heir
to
nothing
better
than
a
quack
medicine
his
mother
lived
up
a
back
street
in
treby
magna
and
her
was
ornamented
with
her
best
and
several
framed
testimonials
to
the
virtues
of
cathartic
lozenges
and
holt
restorative
elixir
there
could
hardly
have
been
a
lot
less
like
harold
transome
than
this
of
the
quack
doctor
son
except
in
the
superficial
facts
that
he
called
himself
a
radical
that
he
was
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
that
he
had
lately
returned
to
his
home
with
ideas
and
resolves
not
a
little
disturbing
to
that
mother
mind
but
holt
unlike
transome
was
much
disposed
to
reveal
her
troubles
and
was
not
without
a
counsellor
into
whose
ear
she
could
pour
them
on
this
second
of
september
when
harold
transome
had
had
his
first
interview
with
jermyn
and
when
the
attorney
went
back
to
his
office
with
new
views
of
canvassing
in
his
mind
holt
had
put
on
her
bonnet
as
early
as
nine
in
the
morning
and
had
gone
to
see
the
reverend
rufus
lyon
minister
of
the
independent
chapel
usually
spoken
of
as
malthouse
yard
chapter
iv
a
pious
and
painful
fuller
lyon
lived
in
a
small
house
not
quite
so
good
as
the
parish
clerk
adjoining
the
entry
which
led
to
the
chapel
yard
the
new
prosperity
of
dissent
at
treby
had
led
to
an
enlargement
of
the
chapel
which
absorbed
all
extra
funds
and
left
none
for
the
enlargement
of
the
minister
income
he
sat
this
morning
as
usual
in
a
low
room
called
his
study
which
by
means
of
a
closet
capable
of
holding
his
bed
served
also
as
a
the
bookshelves
did
not
suffice
for
his
store
of
old
books
which
lay
about
him
in
piles
so
arranged
as
to
leave
narrow
lanes
between
them
for
the
minister
was
much
given
to
walking
about
during
his
hours
of
meditation
and
very
narrow
passages
would
serve
for
his
small
legs
unencumbered
by
any
other
drapery
than
his
black
silk
stockings
and
the
flexible
though
prominent
bows
of
black
ribbon
that
tied
his
he
was
walking
about
now
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
an
attitude
in
which
his
body
seemed
to
bear
about
the
same
proportion
to
his
head
as
the
lower
part
of
a
stone
hermes
bears
to
the
carven
image
that
crowns
it
his
face
looked
old
and
worn
yet
the
curtain
of
hair
that
fell
from
his
bald
crown
and
hung
about
his
neck
retained
much
of
its
original
auburn
tint
and
his
large
brown
eyes
were
still
clear
and
bright
at
the
first
glance
every
one
thought
him
a
very
rusty
old
man
the
boys
often
hooted
after
him
and
called
him
revelations
and
to
many
respectable
church
people
old
lyon
little
legs
and
large
head
seemed
to
make
dissent
additionally
preposterous
but
he
was
too
to
notice
those
who
tittered
at
him
too
absent
from
the
world
of
small
facts
and
petty
impulses
in
which
titterers
live
with
satan
to
argue
against
on
matters
of
vital
experience
as
well
as
of
church
government
with
great
texts
to
meditate
on
which
seemed
to
get
deeper
as
he
tried
to
fathom
them
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
reflect
what
sort
of
image
his
small
person
made
on
the
retina
of
a
beholder
the
good
rufus
had
his
ire
and
his
egoism
but
they
existed
only
as
the
red
heat
which
gave
force
to
his
belief
and
his
teaching
he
was
susceptible
concerning
the
true
office
of
deacons
in
the
primitive
church
and
his
small
nervous
body
was
jarred
from
head
to
foot
by
the
concussion
of
an
argument
to
which
he
saw
no
answer
in
fact
the
only
moments
when
he
could
be
said
to
be
really
conscious
of
his
body
were
when
he
trembled
under
the
pressure
of
some
agitating
thought
he
was
meditating
on
the
text
for
his
sunday
morning
sermon
and
all
the
people
said
amen
a
mere
of
a
text
which
had
split
at
first
only
into
two
divisions
what
was
said
and
who
said
it
but
these
were
growing
into
a
discourse
and
the
preacher
eyes
dilated
and
a
smile
played
about
his
mouth
till
as
his
manner
was
when
he
felt
happily
inspired
he
had
begun
to
utter
his
thoughts
aloud
in
the
varied
measure
and
cadence
habitual
to
him
changing
from
a
rapid
but
distinct
undertone
to
a
loud
emphatic
my
brethren
do
you
think
that
great
shout
was
raised
in
israel
by
each
man
waiting
to
say
till
his
neighbors
had
said
amen
do
you
think
there
will
be
a
great
shout
for
the
right
the
shout
of
a
nation
as
of
one
man
rounded
and
whole
like
the
voice
of
the
archangel
that
bound
together
all
the
listeners
of
earth
and
heaven
if
every
christian
of
you
peeps
round
to
see
what
his
neighbors
in
good
coats
are
doing
or
else
puts
his
hat
before
his
face
that
he
may
shout
and
never
be
heard
but
this
is
what
you
do
when
the
servant
of
god
stands
up
to
deliver
his
message
do
you
lay
your
souls
beneath
the
word
as
you
set
out
your
plants
beneath
the
falling
rain
no
one
of
you
sends
his
eyes
to
all
corners
he
smothers
his
soul
with
small
questions
does
brother
y
think
this
doctrine
high
enough
for
brother
the
church
members
be
pleased
and
another
here
the
door
was
opened
and
old
lyddy
the
minister
servant
put
in
her
head
to
say
in
a
tone
of
despondency
finishing
with
a
groan
here
is
holt
wanting
to
speak
to
you
she
says
she
comes
out
of
season
but
she
in
trouble
lyddy
said
lyon
falling
at
once
into
a
quiet
conversational
tone
if
you
are
wrestling
with
the
enemy
let
me
refer
you
to
ezekiel
the
thirteenth
and
and
beg
of
you
not
to
groan
it
is
a
and
offence
to
my
daughter
she
would
take
no
broth
yesterday
because
she
said
you
had
cried
into
it
thus
you
cause
the
truth
to
be
lightly
spoken
of
and
make
the
enemy
rejoice
if
your
faceache
gives
him
an
advantage
take
a
little
warm
ale
with
your
meat
i
do
not
grudge
the
money
if
i
thought
my
drinking
warm
ale
would
hinder
poor
dear
miss
esther
from
speaking
light
but
she
hates
the
smell
of
it
answer
not
again
lyddy
but
send
up
mistress
holt
to
me
lyddy
closed
the
door
immediately
i
lack
grace
to
deal
with
these
weak
sisters
said
the
minister
again
thinking
aloud
and
walking
their
needs
lie
too
much
out
of
the
track
of
my
meditations
and
take
me
often
unawares
mistress
holt
is
another
who
darkens
counsel
by
words
without
knowledge
and
angers
the
reason
of
the
natural
man
lord
give
me
patience
my
sins
were
heavier
to
bear
than
this
woman
folly
come
in
holt
come
in
he
hastened
to
disencumber
a
chair
of
matthew
henry
commentary
and
begged
his
visitor
to
be
seated
she
was
a
tall
elderly
woman
dressed
in
black
with
a
front
and
a
black
band
over
her
forehead
she
moved
the
chair
a
little
and
seated
herself
in
it
with
some
emphasis
looking
fixedly
at
the
opposite
wall
with
a
hurt
and
argumentative
expression
lyon
had
placed
himself
in
the
chair
against
his
desk
and
waited
with
the
resolute
resignation
of
a
patient
who
is
about
to
undergo
an
operation
but
his
visitor
did
not
speak
you
have
something
on
your
mind
mrs
holt
he
said
at
last
indeed
i
have
sir
else
i
should
be
here
speak
freely
it
well
known
to
you
lyon
that
my
husband
holt
came
from
the
north
and
was
a
member
in
malthouse
yard
long
before
began
to
be
pastor
of
it
which
was
seven
year
ago
last
michaelmas
it
the
truth
lyon
and
i
not
that
woman
to
sit
here
and
say
it
if
it
was
true
certainly
it
is
true
and
if
my
husband
had
been
alive
when
you
come
to
preach
upon
trial
he
have
been
as
good
a
judge
of
your
gifts
as
nuttwood
or
muscat
though
whether
he
have
agreed
with
some
that
your
doctrine
was
high
enough
i
ca
say
for
myself
i
my
opinion
about
high
doctrine
was
it
my
preaching
you
came
to
speak
about
said
the
minister
hurrying
in
the
question
no
lyon
i
not
that
woman
but
this
i
say
for
my
husband
died
before
your
time
that
he
had
a
wonderful
gift
in
prayer
as
the
old
members
well
know
if
anybody
likes
to
ask
not
believing
my
words
and
he
believed
himself
that
the
receipt
for
the
cancer
cure
which
i
sent
out
in
bottles
till
this
very
last
april
before
september
as
now
is
and
have
bottles
standing
by
me
he
believed
it
was
sent
to
him
in
answer
to
prayer
and
nobody
can
deny
it
for
he
prayed
most
regular
and
read
out
of
the
green
baize
bible
holt
paused
appearing
to
think
that
lyon
had
been
successfully
confuted
and
should
show
himself
convinced
has
any
one
been
aspersing
your
husband
character
said
lyon
with
a
slight
initiative
toward
that
relief
of
groaning
for
which
he
had
reproved
lyddy
sir
they
dared
for
though
he
was
a
man
of
prayer
he
did
want
skill
and
knowledge
to
find
things
out
for
himself
and
that
what
i
used
to
say
to
friends
when
they
wondered
at
my
marrying
a
man
from
lancashire
with
no
trade
nor
fortune
but
what
he
got
in
his
head
but
my
husband
tongue
have
been
a
fortune
to
anybody
and
there
was
many
a
one
said
it
was
as
good
as
a
dose
of
physic
to
hear
him
talk
not
but
what
that
got
him
into
trouble
in
lancashire
but
he
always
said
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
he
could
go
and
preach
to
the
blacks
but
he
did
better
than
that
lyon
for
he
married
me
and
this
i
will
say
that
for
age
and
conduct
and
managing
mistress
holt
interrupted
the
minister
these
are
not
the
things
whereby
we
may
edify
one
another
let
me
beg
of
you
to
be
as
brief
as
you
can
my
time
is
not
my
own
well
lyon
i
a
right
to
my
own
character
and
i
one
of
your
congregation
though
i
not
a
church
member
for
i
was
born
in
the
general
baptist
connection
and
as
for
being
saved
without
works
there
a
many
i
dare
say
ca
do
without
that
doctrine
but
i
thank
the
lord
i
never
needed
to
put
on
a
level
with
the
thief
on
the
cross
i
done
duty
and
more
if
anybody
comes
to
that
for
gone
without
my
bit
of
meat
to
make
broth
for
a
sick
neighbor
and
if
there
any
of
the
church
members
say
they
done
the
same
i
ask
them
if
they
had
the
sinking
at
the
stomach
as
i
have
for
i
ever
strove
to
do
the
right
thing
and
more
for
i
always
was
and
i
little
thought
after
being
respected
by
everybody
i
should
come
to
be
reproached
by
my
own
son
and
my
husband
said
when
he
was
he
said
elixir
and
the
pills
and
the
cure
will
support
you
for
they
a
great
name
in
all
the
country
round
and
you
pray
for
a
blessing
on
them
and
so
i
done
lyon
and
to
say
they
not
good
medicines
when
they
been
taken
for
fifty
miles
round
by
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
and
nobody
speaking
against
but
lukin
it
seems
to
me
it
a
flying
in
the
face
of
heaven
for
if
it
was
wrong
to
take
the
medicines
could
the
blessed
lord
have
stopped
it
holt
was
not
given
to
tears
she
was
much
sustained
by
conscious
unimpeachableness
and
by
an
argumentative
tendency
which
usually
checks
the
too
great
activity
of
the
lachrymal
gland
nevertheless
her
eyes
had
become
moist
her
fingers
played
on
her
knee
in
an
agitated
manner
and
she
finally
plucked
a
bit
of
her
gown
and
held
it
with
great
nicety
between
her
thumb
and
finger
lyon
however
by
listening
attentively
had
begun
partly
to
divine
the
source
of
her
trouble
am
i
wrong
in
gathering
from
what
you
say
mistress
holt
that
your
son
has
objected
in
some
way
to
your
sale
of
your
late
husband
medicines
lyon
he
masterful
beyond
everything
and
he
talks
more
than
his
father
did
i
got
my
reason
lyon
and
if
anybody
talks
sense
i
can
follow
him
but
felix
talks
so
wild
and
contradicts
his
mother
and
what
do
you
think
he
says
after
giving
up
his
and
going
off
to
study
at
glasgow
and
getting
through
all
the
bit
of
money
his
father
saved
for
his
what
has
all
his
learning
come
to
he
says
i
better
never
open
my
bible
for
it
as
bad
poison
to
me
as
the
pills
are
to
half
the
people
as
swallow
you
not
speak
of
this
again
lyon
i
do
think
ill
enough
of
you
to
believe
for
i
suppose
a
christian
can
understand
the
word
o
god
without
going
to
glasgow
and
there
texts
upon
texts
about
ointment
and
medicine
and
there
one
as
might
have
been
for
a
receipt
of
my
husband
it
just
as
if
it
was
a
riddle
and
holt
elixir
was
the
answer
your
son
uses
rash
words
mistress
holt
said
the
minister
but
it
is
quite
true
that
we
may
err
in
giving
a
too
private
interpretation
to
the
scripture
the
word
of
god
has
to
satisfy
the
larger
needs
of
his
people
like
the
rain
and
the
sunshine
which
no
man
must
think
to
be
meant
for
his
own
patch
of
solely
will
it
not
be
well
that
i
should
see
your
son
and
talk
with
him
on
these
matters
he
was
at
chapel
i
observe
and
i
suppose
i
am
to
be
his
pastor
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
lyon
for
perhaps
he
listen
to
you
and
not
talk
you
down
as
he
does
his
poor
mother
for
after
been
to
chapel
he
spoke
better
of
you
than
he
does
of
most
he
said
you
was
a
fine
old
fellow
and
an
puritan
he
uses
dreadful
language
lyon
but
i
saw
he
did
mean
you
ill
for
all
that
he
calls
most
folks
religion
rottenness
and
yet
another
time
he
tell
me
i
ought
to
feel
myself
a
sinner
and
do
god
will
and
not
my
own
but
it
my
belief
he
says
first
one
thing
and
then
another
only
to
abuse
his
mother
or
else
he
going
off
his
head
and
must
be
sent
to
a
but
if
he
writes
to
the
loamshire
first
to
tell
everybody
the
medicines
are
good
for
nothing
how
can
i
ever
keep
him
and
myself
tell
him
i
shall
feel
favored
if
he
will
come
and
see
me
this
evening
said
lyon
not
without
a
little
prejudice
in
favor
of
the
young
man
whose
language
about
the
preacher
in
malthouse
yard
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
altogether
dreadful
meanwhile
my
friend
i
counsel
you
to
send
up
a
supplication
which
i
shall
not
fail
to
offer
also
that
you
may
receive
a
spirit
of
humility
and
submission
so
that
you
may
not
be
hindered
from
seeing
and
following
the
divine
guidance
in
this
matter
by
any
false
lights
of
pride
and
obstinacy
of
this
more
when
i
have
spoken
with
your
son
i
not
proud
or
obstinate
lyon
i
never
did
say
i
was
everything
that
was
bad
and
i
never
will
and
why
this
trouble
should
be
sent
on
me
above
everybody
else
for
i
have
told
you
all
he
made
himself
a
journeyman
to
prowd
the
watchmaker
after
all
this
learning
and
he
says
he
go
with
patches
on
his
knees
and
he
shall
like
himself
the
better
and
as
for
him
having
little
boys
to
teach
they
come
in
all
weathers
with
dirty
shoes
if
it
madness
lyon
it
no
use
your
talking
to
him
we
shall
see
perhaps
it
may
even
be
the
disguised
working
of
grace
within
him
we
must
not
judge
rashly
many
eminent
servants
of
god
have
been
led
by
ways
as
strange
then
i
sorry
for
their
mothers
that
all
lyon
and
all
the
more
if
they
been
women
for
not
my
biggest
enemy
whether
it
he
or
she
if
they
speak
the
truth
can
turn
round
and
say
i
deserved
this
trouble
and
when
everybody
gets
their
due
and
people
doings
are
spoke
of
on
the
as
the
bible
says
they
will
be
it
be
known
what
i
gone
through
with
those
medicines
the
pounding
and
the
pouring
and
the
letting
stand
and
the
weighing
up
early
and
down
late
there
nobody
knows
yet
but
one
that
worthy
to
know
and
the
pasting
o
the
printed
labels
right
side
upwards
few
women
would
have
gone
through
with
it
and
it
reasonable
to
think
it
be
made
up
to
me
for
if
there
promised
and
purchased
blessings
i
should
think
this
trouble
is
purchasing
for
if
my
son
felix
does
have
a
put
on
him
he
have
his
way
but
i
say
no
more
i
wish
you
lyon
and
thank
you
though
i
well
know
it
your
duty
to
act
as
you
doing
and
i
never
troubled
you
about
my
own
soul
as
some
do
who
look
down
on
me
for
not
being
a
church
member
farewell
mistress
holt
farewell
i
pray
that
a
more
powerful
teacher
than
i
am
may
instruct
you
the
door
was
closed
and
the
rufus
walked
about
again
saying
aloud
groaningly
this
woman
has
sat
under
the
gospel
all
her
life
and
she
is
as
blind
as
a
heathen
and
as
proud
and
as
a
pharisee
yet
she
is
one
of
the
souls
i
watch
for
is
true
that
even
sara
the
chosen
mother
of
god
people
showed
a
spirit
of
unbelief
and
perhaps
of
selfish
anger
and
it
is
a
passage
that
bears
the
unmistakable
signet
honor
to
the
wife
or
woman
as
unto
the
weaker
vessel
for
therein
is
the
greatest
check
put
on
the
ready
scorn
of
the
natural
man
chapter
citizen
sir
there
a
hurry
in
the
veins
of
youth
that
makes
a
vice
of
virtue
by
excess
citizen
what
if
the
coolness
of
our
tardier
veins
be
loss
of
virtue
citizen
all
things
cool
with
time
the
sun
itself
they
say
till
heat
shall
find
a
general
level
nowhere
in
excess
citizen
is
a
poor
climax
to
my
weaker
thought
that
future
middlingness
in
the
evening
when
lyon
was
expecting
the
knock
at
the
door
that
would
announce
felix
holt
he
occupied
his
cushionless
in
the
and
was
skimming
rapidly
in
his
way
by
the
light
of
one
candle
the
pages
of
a
missionary
report
emitting
occasionally
a
slight
that
appeared
to
be
expressive
of
criticism
rather
than
of
approbation
the
room
was
dismally
furnished
the
only
objects
indicating
an
intention
of
ornament
being
a
bookcase
a
map
of
the
holy
land
an
engraved
portrait
of
doddridge
and
a
black
bust
with
a
colored
face
which
for
some
reason
or
other
was
covered
with
green
gauze
yet
any
one
whose
attention
was
quite
awake
must
have
been
aware
even
on
entering
of
certain
things
that
were
incongruous
with
the
general
air
of
sombreness
and
privation
there
was
a
delicate
scent
of
dried
the
light
by
which
the
minister
was
reading
was
a
in
a
white
earthenware
and
the
table
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fireplace
held
a
dainty
frilled
with
blue
satin
felix
holt
when
he
entered
was
not
in
an
observant
mood
and
when
after
seating
himself
at
the
minister
invitation
near
the
little
table
which
held
the
he
stared
at
the
opposite
to
him
he
did
so
without
any
wonder
or
consciousness
that
the
candle
was
not
of
tallow
but
the
minister
sensitiveness
gave
another
interpretation
to
the
gaze
which
he
divined
rather
than
saw
and
in
alarm
lest
this
inconsistent
extravagance
should
obstruct
his
usefulness
he
hastened
to
say
you
are
doubtless
amazed
to
see
me
with
a
my
young
friend
but
this
undue
luxury
is
paid
for
with
the
earnings
of
my
daughter
who
is
so
delicately
framed
that
the
smell
of
tallow
is
loathsome
to
her
i
heeded
not
the
candle
sir
i
thank
heaven
i
am
not
a
mouse
to
have
a
nose
that
takes
note
of
wax
or
tallow
the
loud
abrupt
tones
made
the
old
man
vibrate
a
little
he
had
been
stroking
his
chin
gently
before
with
a
sense
that
he
must
be
very
quiet
and
deliberate
in
his
treatment
of
the
eccentric
young
man
but
now
quite
unreflectingly
he
drew
forth
a
pair
of
spectacles
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
using
when
he
wanted
to
observe
his
interlocutor
more
closely
than
usual
and
i
myself
in
fact
am
equally
indifferent
he
said
as
he
opened
and
adjusted
his
glasses
so
that
i
have
a
sufficient
light
on
my
book
here
his
large
eyes
looked
discerningly
through
the
spectacles
is
the
quality
of
the
page
you
care
about
not
of
the
candle
said
felix
smiling
pleasantly
enough
at
his
inspector
you
thinking
that
you
have
a
page
before
you
now
that
was
true
the
minister
accustomed
to
the
respectable
air
of
provincial
townsmen
and
especially
to
the
sleek
gravity
of
his
own
male
congregation
felt
a
slight
shock
as
his
glasses
made
perfectly
clear
to
him
the
person
of
this
questionable
young
man
without
waistcoat
or
cravat
but
the
possibility
supported
by
some
of
holt
words
that
a
disguised
work
of
grace
might
be
going
on
in
the
son
of
whom
she
complained
so
bitterly
checked
any
hasty
interpretations
i
abstain
from
judging
by
the
outward
appearance
only
he
answered
with
his
usual
simplicity
i
myself
have
experienced
that
when
the
spirit
is
much
exercised
it
is
difficult
to
remember
and
strings
and
such
small
accidents
of
our
vesture
which
are
nevertheless
decent
and
needful
so
long
as
we
sojourn
in
the
flesh
and
you
too
my
young
friend
as
i
gather
from
your
mother
troubled
and
confused
report
are
undergoing
some
travail
of
mind
you
will
not
i
trust
object
to
open
yourself
fully
to
me
as
to
an
aged
pastor
who
has
himself
had
much
inward
wrestling
and
has
especially
known
much
temptation
from
doubt
as
to
doubt
said
felix
loudly
and
brusquely
as
before
if
it
is
those
absurd
medicines
and
gulling
advertisements
that
my
mother
has
been
talking
of
to
you
and
i
suppose
it
is
i
no
more
doubt
about
than
i
have
about
i
know
there
a
stage
of
speculation
in
which
a
man
may
doubt
whether
a
pickpocket
is
blameworthy
but
i
not
one
of
your
subtle
fellows
who
keep
looking
at
the
world
through
their
own
legs
if
i
allowed
the
sale
of
those
medicines
to
go
on
and
my
mother
to
live
out
of
the
proceeds
when
i
can
keep
her
by
the
honest
labor
of
my
hands
i
not
the
least
doubt
that
i
should
be
a
rascal
i
would
fain
enquire
more
particularly
into
your
objection
to
these
medicines
said
lyon
gravely
notwithstanding
his
conscientiousness
and
a
certain
originality
in
his
own
mental
disposition
he
was
too
little
used
to
high
principle
quite
dissociated
from
sectarian
phraseology
to
be
as
immediately
in
sympathy
with
it
as
he
would
otherwise
have
been
i
know
they
have
been
well
reported
of
and
many
wise
persons
have
tried
remedies
providentially
discovered
by
those
who
are
not
regular
physicians
and
have
found
a
blessing
in
the
use
of
them
i
may
mention
the
eminent
wesley
who
though
i
hold
not
altogether
with
his
arminian
doctrine
nor
with
the
usages
of
his
institutions
was
nevertheless
a
man
of
god
and
the
journals
of
various
christians
whose
names
have
left
a
sweet
savor
might
be
cited
in
the
same
sense
moreover
your
father
who
originally
concocted
these
medicines
and
left
them
as
a
provision
for
your
mother
was
as
i
understand
a
man
whose
walk
was
not
unfaithful
my
father
was
ignorant
said
felix
bluntly
he
knew
neither
the
complication
of
the
human
system
nor
the
way
in
which
drugs
counteract
each
other
ignorance
is
not
so
damnable
as
humbug
but
when
it
prescribes
pills
it
may
happen
to
do
more
harm
i
know
something
about
these
things
i
was
for
five
miserable
years
to
a
stupid
brute
of
a
country
apothecary
my
poor
father
left
money
for
that
he
thought
nothing
could
be
finer
for
me
no
matter
i
know
that
the
cathartic
pills
are
a
drastic
compound
which
may
be
as
bad
as
poison
to
half
the
people
who
swallow
them
that
the
elixir
is
an
absurd
farrago
of
a
dozen
incompatible
things
and
that
the
cancer
cure
might
as
well
be
bottled
lyon
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
his
simplicity
was
strongly
mixed
with
sagacity
as
well
as
sectarian
prejudice
and
he
did
not
rely
at
once
on
a
integrity
satan
might
have
flavored
it
with
ostentation
presently
he
asked
in
a
rapid
low
tone
how
long
have
you
known
this
young
man
well
put
sir
said
felix
i
known
it
a
good
deal
longer
than
i
have
acted
upon
it
like
plenty
of
other
things
but
you
believe
in
conversion
yea
verily
so
do
i
was
converted
by
six
weeks
debauchery
the
minister
started
young
man
he
said
solemnly
going
up
close
to
felix
and
laying
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
speak
not
lightly
of
the
divine
operations
and
restrain
unseemly
words
i
not
speaking
lightly
said
felix
if
i
had
not
seen
that
i
was
making
a
hog
of
myself
very
fast
and
that
even
if
i
could
have
got
plenty
of
it
was
a
poor
sort
of
thing
i
should
never
have
looked
life
fairly
in
the
face
to
see
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
i
laughed
out
loud
at
last
to
think
that
a
poor
devil
like
me
in
a
scotch
garret
with
my
stockings
out
at
heel
and
a
shilling
or
two
to
be
dissipated
upon
with
a
smell
of
raw
haggis
mounting
from
below
and
old
women
breathing
gin
as
they
passed
me
on
the
stairs
wanting
to
turn
my
life
into
easy
pleasure
then
i
began
to
see
what
else
it
could
be
turned
into
not
much
perhaps
this
world
is
not
a
very
fine
place
for
a
good
many
of
the
people
in
it
but
i
made
up
my
mind
it
sha
be
the
worse
for
me
if
i
can
help
it
they
may
tell
me
i
ca
alter
the
world
that
there
must
be
a
certain
number
of
sneaks
and
robbers
in
it
and
if
i
do
lie
and
filch
somebody
else
will
well
then
somebody
else
shall
for
i
wo
that
the
upshot
of
my
conversion
lyon
if
you
want
to
know
it
lyon
removed
his
hand
from
felix
shoulder
and
walked
about
again
did
you
sit
under
any
preacher
at
glasgow
young
man
no
i
heard
most
of
the
preachers
once
but
i
never
wanted
to
hear
them
twice
the
good
rufus
was
not
without
a
slight
rising
of
resentment
at
this
young
man
want
of
reverence
it
was
not
yet
plain
whether
he
wanted
to
hear
twice
the
preacher
in
malthouse
yard
but
the
resentful
feeling
was
carefully
repressed
a
soul
in
so
peculiar
a
condition
must
be
dealt
with
delicately
and
now
may
i
ask
he
said
what
course
you
mean
to
take
after
hindering
your
mother
from
making
and
selling
these
drugs
i
speak
no
more
in
their
favor
after
what
you
have
said
god
forbid
that
i
should
strive
to
hinder
you
from
seeking
whatsoever
things
are
honest
and
honorable
but
your
mother
is
advanced
in
years
she
needs
comfortable
sustenance
you
have
doubtless
considered
how
you
may
make
her
amends
that
provideth
not
for
his
own
i
trust
you
respect
the
authority
that
so
speaks
and
i
will
not
suppose
that
after
being
tender
of
conscience
toward
strangers
you
will
be
careless
toward
your
mother
there
be
indeed
some
who
taking
a
mighty
charge
on
their
shoulder
must
perforce
leave
their
households
to
providence
and
to
the
care
of
humbler
brethren
but
in
such
a
case
the
call
must
be
clear
i
shall
keep
my
mother
as
well
nay
better
than
she
has
kept
herself
she
has
always
been
frugal
with
my
watch
and
clock
cleaning
and
teaching
one
or
two
little
chaps
that
i
got
to
come
to
me
i
can
earn
enough
as
for
me
i
can
live
on
bran
porridge
i
have
the
stomach
of
a
rhinoceros
but
for
a
young
man
so
well
furnished
as
you
who
can
questionless
write
a
good
hand
and
keep
books
were
it
not
well
to
seek
some
higher
situation
as
clerk
or
assistant
i
could
speak
to
brother
muscat
who
is
well
acquainted
with
all
such
openings
any
place
in
pendrell
bank
i
fear
is
now
closed
against
such
as
are
not
churchmen
it
used
not
to
be
so
but
a
year
ago
he
discharged
brother
bodkin
although
he
was
a
valuable
servant
still
something
might
be
found
there
are
ranks
and
degrees
and
those
who
can
serve
in
the
higher
must
not
unadvisedly
change
what
seems
to
be
a
providential
appointment
your
poor
mother
is
not
altogether
excuse
me
lyon
i
had
all
that
out
with
my
mother
and
i
may
as
well
save
you
any
trouble
by
telling
you
that
my
mind
has
been
made
up
about
that
a
long
while
ago
i
take
no
employment
that
obliges
me
to
prop
up
my
chin
with
a
high
cravat
and
wear
straps
and
pass
the
livelong
day
with
a
set
of
fellows
who
spend
their
spare
money
on
shirt
pins
that
sort
of
work
is
really
lower
than
many
handicrafts
it
only
happens
to
be
paid
out
of
proportion
that
why
i
set
myself
to
learn
the
watchmaking
trade
my
father
was
a
weaver
first
of
all
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
he
had
remained
a
weaver
i
came
home
through
lancashire
and
saw
an
uncle
of
mine
who
is
a
weaver
still
i
mean
to
stick
to
the
class
i
belong
to
people
who
do
follow
the
fashions
lyon
was
silent
a
few
moments
this
dialogue
was
far
from
plain
sailing
he
was
not
certain
of
his
latitude
and
longitude
if
the
despiser
of
glasgow
preachers
had
been
arguing
in
favor
of
gin
and
lyon
course
would
have
been
clearer
well
well
he
said
deliberately
it
is
true
that
paul
exercised
the
trade
of
though
he
was
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
rabbis
paul
was
a
wise
man
said
felix
why
should
i
want
to
get
into
the
middle
class
because
i
have
some
learning
the
most
of
the
middle
class
are
as
ignorant
as
the
working
people
about
everything
that
does
belong
to
their
own
brummagem
life
that
how
the
workingmen
are
left
to
foolish
devices
and
keep
worsening
themselves
the
best
heads
among
them
forsake
their
boon
comrades
and
go
in
for
a
house
with
a
high
and
a
brass
knocker
lyon
stroked
his
mouth
and
chin
perhaps
because
he
felt
some
disposition
to
smile
and
it
would
not
be
well
to
smile
too
readily
at
what
seemed
but
a
weedy
resemblance
of
christian
unworldliness
on
the
contrary
there
might
be
a
dangerous
snare
in
an
unsanctified
outstepping
of
average
christian
practice
nevertheless
he
observed
gravely
it
is
by
such
that
many
have
been
enabled
to
do
good
service
to
the
cause
of
liberty
and
to
the
public
the
ring
and
the
robe
of
joseph
were
no
objects
for
a
good
man
ambition
but
they
were
the
signs
of
that
credit
which
he
won
by
his
skill
and
which
enabled
him
to
act
as
a
saviour
to
his
brethren
oh
yes
your
ringed
and
scented
men
of
the
people
i
wo
be
one
of
them
let
a
man
once
throttle
himself
with
a
satin
stock
and
he
get
new
wants
and
new
motives
metamorphosis
will
have
begun
at
his
and
it
will
go
on
till
it
has
changed
his
likings
first
and
then
his
reasoning
which
will
follow
his
likings
as
the
feet
of
a
hungry
dog
follow
his
nose
i
have
none
of
your
clerkly
gentility
i
might
end
by
collecting
greasy
pence
from
poor
men
to
buy
myself
a
fine
coat
and
a
glutton
dinner
on
pretence
of
serving
the
poor
men
sooner
be
paley
fat
pigeon
than
a
demagogue
all
tongue
and
stomach
though
here
felix
changed
his
voice
a
little
i
should
like
well
enough
to
be
another
sort
of
demagogue
if
i
could
then
you
have
a
strong
interest
in
the
great
political
movements
of
these
times
said
lyon
with
a
perceptible
flashing
of
the
eyes
i
should
think
so
i
despise
every
man
who
has
not
or
having
it
does
try
to
rouse
it
in
other
men
right
my
young
friend
right
said
the
minister
in
a
deep
cordial
tone
inevitably
his
mind
was
drawn
aside
from
the
immediate
consideration
of
felix
holt
spiritual
interest
by
the
prospect
of
political
sympathy
in
those
days
so
many
instruments
of
god
cause
in
the
fight
for
religious
and
political
liberty
held
creeds
that
were
painfully
wrong
and
indeed
irreconcilable
with
salvation
that
is
my
own
view
which
i
maintain
in
the
face
of
some
opposition
from
brethren
who
contend
that
a
share
in
public
movements
is
a
hindrance
to
the
closer
walk
and
that
the
pulpit
is
no
place
for
teaching
men
their
duties
as
members
of
the
commonwealth
i
have
had
much
puerile
blame
cast
upon
me
because
i
have
uttered
such
names
as
brougham
and
wellington
in
the
pulpit
why
not
wellington
as
well
as
rabshakeh
and
why
not
brougham
as
well
as
balaam
does
god
know
less
of
men
than
he
did
in
the
days
of
hezekiah
and
moses
is
his
arm
shortened
and
is
the
world
become
too
wide
for
his
providence
but
they
say
there
are
no
politics
in
the
new
testament
well
they
right
enough
there
said
felix
with
his
usual
unceremoniousness
what
you
are
of
those
who
hold
that
a
christian
minister
should
not
meddle
with
public
matters
in
the
pulpit
said
lyon
coloring
i
am
ready
to
join
issue
on
that
point
not
i
sir
said
felix
i
should
say
teach
any
truth
you
can
whether
it
in
the
testament
or
out
of
it
it
little
enough
anybody
can
get
hold
of
and
still
less
what
he
can
drive
into
the
skulls
of
a
generation
such
as
mostly
fill
your
chapels
young
man
said
lyon
pausing
in
front
of
felix
he
spoke
rapidly
as
he
always
did
except
when
his
words
were
specially
weighted
with
emotion
he
overflowed
with
matter
and
in
his
mind
matter
was
always
completely
organized
into
words
i
speak
not
on
my
own
behalf
for
not
only
have
i
no
desire
that
any
man
should
think
of
me
above
that
which
he
seeth
me
to
be
but
i
am
aware
of
much
that
should
make
me
patient
under
a
disesteem
resting
even
on
too
hasty
a
construction
i
speak
not
as
claiming
reverence
for
my
own
age
and
office
not
to
shame
you
but
to
warn
you
it
is
good
that
you
should
use
plainness
of
speech
and
i
am
not
of
those
who
would
enforce
a
submissive
silence
on
the
young
that
they
themselves
being
elders
may
be
heard
at
large
but
elihu
was
the
youngest
of
job
friends
yet
was
there
a
wise
rebuke
in
his
words
and
the
aged
eli
was
taught
by
a
revelation
to
the
boy
samuel
i
have
to
keep
a
special
watch
over
myself
in
this
matter
inasmuch
as
i
have
need
of
utterance
which
makes
the
thought
within
me
seem
as
a
fire
until
i
have
shot
it
forth
as
it
were
in
arrowy
words
each
one
hitting
its
mark
therefore
i
pray
for
a
listening
spirit
which
is
a
great
mark
of
grace
nevertheless
my
young
friend
i
am
bound
as
i
said
to
warn
you
the
temptations
that
most
beset
those
who
have
great
natural
gifts
and
are
wise
after
the
flesh
are
pride
and
scorn
more
particularly
toward
those
weak
things
of
the
world
which
have
been
chosen
to
confound
the
things
which
are
mighty
the
scornful
nostril
and
the
high
head
gather
not
the
odors
that
lie
on
the
track
of
truth
the
mind
that
is
too
ready
at
contempt
and
reprobation
is
here
the
door
opened
and
lyon
paused
to
look
around
but
seeing
only
lyddy
with
the
he
went
on
is
i
may
say
as
a
clenched
fist
that
can
give
blows
but
is
shut
up
from
receiving
and
holding
aught
that
is
precious
though
it
were
manna
i
understand
you
sir
said
felix
putting
out
his
hand
to
the
little
man
who
had
come
close
to
him
as
he
delivered
the
last
sentence
with
sudden
emphasis
and
slowness
but
i
not
inclined
to
clench
my
fist
at
you
well
well
said
lyon
shaking
the
proffered
hand
we
shall
see
more
of
each
other
and
i
trust
shall
have
much
profitable
communing
you
will
stay
and
have
a
dish
of
tea
with
us
we
take
the
meal
late
on
thursdays
because
my
daughter
is
detained
by
giving
a
lesson
in
the
french
tongue
but
she
is
doubtless
returned
now
and
will
presently
come
and
pour
out
tea
for
us
thank
you
i
stay
said
felix
not
from
any
curiosity
to
see
the
minister
daughter
but
from
a
liking
for
the
society
of
the
minister
himself
for
his
quaint
looks
and
ways
and
the
transparency
of
his
talk
which
gave
a
charm
even
to
his
weakness
the
daughter
was
probably
some
prim
miss
neat
sensible
pious
but
all
in
a
small
feminine
way
in
which
felix
was
no
more
interested
than
in
dorcas
meetings
biographies
of
devout
women
and
that
amount
of
ornamental
knitting
which
was
not
inconsistent
with
seriousness
i
perhaps
a
little
too
fond
of
banging
and
smashing
he
went
on
a
phrenologist
at
glasgow
told
me
i
had
large
veneration
another
man
there
who
knew
me
laughed
out
and
said
i
was
the
most
blasphemous
iconoclast
living
says
my
phrenologist
because
of
his
large
ideality
which
prevents
him
from
finding
anything
perfect
enough
to
be
venerated
of
course
i
put
my
ears
down
and
wagged
my
tail
at
that
stroking
yes
yes
i
have
had
my
own
head
explored
with
somewhat
similar
results
it
is
i
fear
but
a
vain
show
of
fulfilling
the
heathen
precept
thyself
and
too
often
leads
to
a
which
will
subsist
in
the
absence
of
that
fruit
by
which
alone
the
quality
of
the
tree
is
made
evident
nevertheless
esther
my
dear
this
is
holt
whose
acquaintance
i
have
now
been
making
with
more
than
ordinary
interest
he
will
take
tea
with
us
esther
bowed
slightly
as
she
walked
across
the
room
to
fetch
the
candle
and
place
it
near
her
tray
felix
rose
and
bowed
also
with
an
air
of
indifference
which
was
perhaps
exaggerated
by
the
fact
that
he
was
inwardly
surprised
the
minister
daughter
was
not
the
sort
of
person
he
expected
she
was
quite
incongruous
with
his
notion
of
daughters
in
general
and
though
he
had
expected
something
nowise
delightful
the
incongruity
repelled
him
a
very
delicate
scent
the
faint
suggestion
of
a
garden
was
wafted
as
she
went
he
would
not
observe
her
but
he
had
a
sense
of
an
elastic
walk
the
tread
of
small
feet
a
long
neck
and
a
high
crown
of
shining
brown
plaits
and
curls
that
floated
backward
things
in
short
that
suggested
a
fine
lady
to
him
and
determined
him
to
notice
her
as
little
as
possible
a
fine
lady
was
always
a
sort
of
affair
not
natural
and
with
no
beauty
for
him
as
art
but
a
fine
lady
as
the
daughter
of
this
rusty
old
puritan
was
especially
offensive
nevertheless
continued
lyon
who
rarely
let
drop
any
thread
of
discourse
that
phrenological
science
is
not
irreconcilable
with
the
revealed
dispensations
and
it
is
undeniable
that
we
have
our
varying
native
dispositions
which
even
grace
will
not
obliterate
i
myself
from
my
youth
up
have
been
given
to
question
too
curiously
concerning
the
truth
to
examine
and
sift
the
medicine
of
the
soul
rather
than
to
apply
it
if
your
truth
happens
to
be
such
medicine
as
holt
pills
and
elixir
the
less
you
swallow
of
it
the
better
said
felix
but
and
usually
recommend
swallowing
when
a
man
sees
his
livelihood
in
a
pill
or
a
proposition
he
likes
to
have
orders
for
the
dose
and
not
curious
enquiries
this
speech
verged
on
rudeness
but
it
was
delivered
with
a
brusque
openness
that
implied
the
absence
of
any
personal
intention
the
minister
daughter
was
now
for
the
first
time
startled
into
looking
at
felix
but
her
survey
of
this
unusual
speaker
was
soon
made
and
she
relieved
her
father
from
the
need
to
reply
by
saying
the
tea
is
poured
out
father
that
was
the
signal
for
lyon
to
advance
toward
the
table
raise
his
right
hand
and
ask
a
blessing
at
sufficient
length
for
esther
to
glance
at
the
visitor
again
there
seemed
to
be
no
danger
of
his
looking
at
her
he
was
observing
her
father
she
had
time
to
remark
that
he
was
a
peculiar
looking
person
but
not
insignificant
which
was
the
quality
that
most
hopelessly
consigned
a
man
to
perdition
he
was
massively
built
the
striking
points
in
his
face
were
large
clear
gray
eyes
and
full
lips
will
you
draw
up
to
the
table
mr
holt
said
the
minister
in
the
act
of
rising
felix
pushed
back
his
chair
too
suddenly
against
the
rickety
table
close
by
him
and
down
went
the
flying
open
and
dispersing
on
the
floor
reels
thimble
a
small
sealed
bottle
of
attar
of
rose
and
something
heavier
than
these
a
duodecimo
volume
which
fell
near
him
between
the
table
and
the
fender
oh
my
stars
said
felix
i
beg
your
pardon
esther
had
already
started
up
and
with
wonderful
quickness
had
picked
up
half
the
small
rolling
things
while
felix
was
lifting
the
basket
and
the
book
this
last
had
opened
and
had
its
leaves
crushed
in
falling
and
with
the
instinct
of
a
bookish
man
he
saw
nothing
more
pressing
to
be
done
than
to
flatten
the
corners
of
the
leaves
byron
poems
he
said
in
a
tone
of
disgust
while
esther
was
recovering
all
the
other
articles
dream
he
better
have
been
asleep
and
snoring
what
do
you
stuff
your
memory
with
byron
miss
lyon
felix
on
his
side
was
led
at
last
to
look
straight
at
esther
but
it
was
with
a
strong
denunciatory
and
pedagogic
intention
of
course
he
saw
more
clearly
than
ever
that
she
was
a
fine
lady
she
reddened
drew
up
her
long
neck
and
said
as
she
retreated
to
her
chair
again
i
have
a
great
admiration
for
byron
lyon
had
paused
in
the
act
of
drawing
his
chair
to
the
tea
table
and
was
looking
on
at
this
scene
wrinkling
the
corners
of
his
eyes
with
a
perplexed
smile
esther
would
not
have
wished
him
to
know
anything
about
the
volume
of
byron
but
she
was
too
proud
to
show
any
concern
he
is
a
worldly
and
vain
writer
i
fear
said
lyon
he
knew
scarcely
anything
of
the
poet
whose
books
embodied
the
faith
and
ritual
of
many
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
a
misanthropic
debauchee
said
felix
lifting
a
chair
with
one
hand
and
holding
the
book
open
in
the
other
whose
notion
of
a
hero
was
that
he
should
disorder
his
stomach
and
despise
mankind
his
corsairs
and
renegades
his
alps
and
manfreds
are
the
most
paltry
puppets
that
were
ever
pulled
by
the
strings
of
lust
and
pride
hand
the
book
to
me
said
lyon
let
me
beg
of
you
to
put
it
aside
till
after
tea
father
said
esther
however
objectionable
holt
may
find
its
pages
they
would
certainly
be
made
worse
by
being
greased
with
that
is
true
my
dear
said
lyon
laying
down
the
book
on
the
small
table
behind
him
he
saw
that
his
daughter
was
angry
ho
ho
thought
felix
her
father
is
frightened
at
her
how
came
he
to
have
such
a
peacock
for
his
daughter
but
she
shall
see
that
i
am
not
frightened
then
he
said
aloud
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
will
justify
your
admiration
for
such
a
writer
miss
lyon
i
should
not
attempt
it
with
you
holt
said
esther
you
have
such
strong
words
at
command
that
they
make
the
smallest
argument
seem
formidable
if
i
had
ever
met
the
giant
cormoran
i
should
have
made
a
point
of
agreeing
with
him
in
his
literary
opinions
esther
had
that
excellent
thing
in
woman
a
soft
voice
with
clear
fluent
utterance
her
sauciness
was
always
charming
because
it
was
without
emphasis
and
was
accompanied
with
graceful
little
turns
of
the
head
felix
laughed
at
her
thrust
with
young
heartiness
my
daughter
is
a
critic
of
words
holt
said
the
minister
smiling
complacently
and
often
corrects
mine
on
the
ground
of
niceties
which
i
profess
are
as
dark
to
me
as
if
they
were
the
reports
of
a
sixth
sense
which
i
possess
not
i
am
an
eager
seeker
for
precision
and
would
fain
find
language
subtle
enough
to
follow
the
utmost
intricacies
of
the
soul
pathways
but
i
see
not
why
a
round
word
that
means
some
object
made
and
blessed
by
the
creator
should
be
branded
and
banished
as
a
malefactor
oh
your
niceties
i
know
what
they
are
said
felix
in
his
usual
they
go
on
your
system
of
may
suggest
what
is
unpleasant
so
you
better
say
or
something
else
such
a
long
way
off
the
fact
that
nobody
is
obliged
to
think
of
it
those
are
your
roundabout
euphuisms
that
dress
up
swindling
till
it
looks
as
well
as
honesty
and
shoot
with
boiled
peas
instead
of
bullets
i
hate
your
gentlemanly
speakers
then
you
would
not
like
jermyn
i
think
said
esther
that
reminds
me
father
that
when
i
was
giving
miss
louisa
jermyn
her
lesson
jermyn
came
in
and
spoke
to
me
with
grand
politeness
and
asked
me
at
what
times
you
were
likely
to
be
disengaged
because
he
wished
to
make
your
better
acquaintance
and
consult
you
on
matters
of
importance
he
never
took
the
least
notice
of
me
before
can
you
guess
the
reason
of
his
sudden
ceremoniousness
nay
child
said
the
minister
ponderingly
politics
of
course
said
felix
he
on
some
committee
an
election
is
coming
universal
peace
is
declared
and
the
foxes
have
a
sincere
interest
in
prolonging
the
lives
of
the
poultry
eh
lyon
that
it
nay
not
so
he
is
the
close
ally
of
the
transome
family
who
are
blind
hereditary
tories
like
the
debarrys
and
will
drive
their
tenants
to
the
poll
as
if
they
were
sheep
and
it
has
even
been
hinted
that
the
heir
who
is
coming
from
the

it

said
that
he
has
enormous
wealth
and

that

said
esther
i
heard
miss
jermyn
tell
her
sister
that
she
had
seen
him
going
out
of
her
father
room
is
strange
said
lyon
something
extraordinary
must
have
happened
said
esther
for
jermyn
to
intend
courting
us
miss
jermyn
said
to
me
only
the
other
day
that
she
could
not
think
how
i
came
to
be
so
well
educated
and
ladylike
she
always
thought
dissenters
were
ignorant
vulgar
people
i
said
so
they
were
usually
and
church
people
also
in
small
towns
she
considers
herself
a
judge
of
what
is
ladylike
and
she
is
vulgarity
personified
with
large
feet
and
the
most
odious
scent
on
her
handkerchief
and
a
bonnet
that
looks
like
fashion
printed
in
capital
letters
one
sort
of
is
as
good
as
another
said
felix
no
indeed
pardon
me
said
esther
a
real
does
not
wear
clothes
that
flare
in
people
eyes
or
use
importunate
scents
or
make
a
noise
as
she
moves
she
is
something
refined
and
graceful
and
charming
and
never
obtrusive
oh
yes
said
felix
contemptuously
and
she
reads
byron
also
and
admires
childe
harold
gentlemen
of
unspeakable
woes
who
employ
a
hairdresser
and
look
seriously
at
themselves
in
the
glass
esther
reddened
and
gave
a
little
toss
felix
went
on
triumphantly
a
is
a
thing
with
small
airs
and
small
notions
about
as
applicable
to
the
business
of
life
as
a
pair
of
tweezers
to
the
clearing
of
a
forest
ask
your
father
what
those
old
persecuted
emigrant
puritans
would
have
done
with
wives
and
daughters
oh
there
is
no
danger
of
such
said
esther
men
who
are
unpleasant
companions
and
make
frights
of
themselves
are
sure
to
get
wives
tasteless
enough
to
suit
them
esther
my
dear
said
lyon
let
not
your
playfulness
betray
you
into
disrespect
toward
those
venerable
pilgrims
they
struggled
and
endured
in
order
to
cherish
and
plant
anew
the
seeds
of
a
scriptural
doctrine
and
of
a
pure
discipline
yes
i
know
said
esther
hastily
dreading
a
discourse
on
the
pilgrim
fathers
oh
they
were
an
ugly
lot
felix
burst
in
making
lyon
start
miss
medora
would
have
minded
if
they
had
all
been
put
into
the
pillory
and
lost
their
ears
she
would
have
said
ears
did
stick
out
so
i
should
wonder
if
that
a
bust
of
one
of
them
here
felix
with
sudden
keenness
of
observation
nodded
at
the
black
bust
with
the
gauze
over
its
colored
face
no
said
lyon
that
is
the
eminent
george
whitfield
who
you
well
know
had
a
gift
of
oratory
as
of
one
on
whom
the
tongue
of
flame
had
rested
visibly
but
providence
doubtless
for
wise
ends
in
relation
to
the
inner
man
for
i
would
not
enquire
too
closely
into
minutiæ
which
carry
too
many
plausible
interpretations
for
any
one
of
them
to
be
stable
providence
i
say
ordained
that
the
good
man
should
squint
and
my
daughter
has
not
yet
learned
to
bear
with
his
infirmity
she
has
put
a
veil
over
it
suppose
you
had
squinted
yourself
said
felix
looking
at
esther
then
doubtless
you
could
have
been
more
polite
to
me
holt
said
esther
rising
and
placing
herself
at
her
you
seem
to
prefer
what
is
unusual
and
ugly
a
peacock
thought
felix
i
should
like
to
come
and
scold
her
every
day
and
make
her
cry
and
cut
her
fine
hair
off
felix
rose
to
go
and
said
i
will
not
take
up
any
more
of
your
valuable
time
lyon
i
know
that
you
have
not
many
spare
evenings
that
is
true
my
young
friend
for
i
now
go
to
sproxton
one
evening
in
the
week
i
do
not
despair
that
we
may
some
day
need
a
chapel
there
though
the
hearers
do
not
multiply
save
among
the
women
and
there
is
no
work
as
yet
begun
among
the
miners
themselves
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
in
my
walk
thither
at
five
if
you
would
like
to
see
how
that
population
has
grown
of
late
years
oh
i
been
to
sproxton
already
several
times
i
had
a
congregation
of
my
own
there
last
sunday
evening
what
do
you
preach
said
lyon
with
brightened
glance
not
exactly
i
went
to
the
lyon
started
i
trust
you
are
putting
a
riddle
to
me
young
man
even
as
samson
did
to
his
companions
from
what
you
said
but
lately
it
can
not
be
that
you
are
given
to
tippling
and
to
taverns
oh
i
do
drink
much
i
order
a
pint
of
beer
and
i
get
into
talk
with
the
fellows
over
their
pots
and
pipes
somebody
must
take
a
little
knowledge
and
to
them
in
this
way
else
how
are
they
to
get
it
i
go
for
educating
the
so
i
put
myself
in
the
way
of
my
pupils
my
academy
is
the
i
walk
with
you
with
pleasure
do
so
do
so
said
lyon
shaking
hands
with
his
odd
acquaintance
we
shall
understand
each
other
better
i
doubt
not
i
wish
you
miss
lyon
esther
bowed
very
slightly
without
speaking
that
is
a
singular
young
man
esther
said
the
minister
walking
about
after
felix
was
gone
i
discern
in
him
a
love
for
whatsoever
things
are
honest
and
true
which
i
would
fain
believe
to
be
an
earnest
of
further
endowment
with
the
wisdom
that
is
from
on
high
it
is
true
that
as
the
traveller
in
the
desert
is
often
lured
by
a
false
vision
of
water
and
freshness
to
turn
aside
from
the
track
which
leads
to
the
tried
and
established
fountains
so
the
evil
one
will
take
advantage
of
a
natural
yearning
toward
the
better
to
delude
the
soul
with
a
belief
in
a
visionary
virtue
higher
than
the
ordinary
fruits
of
the
spirit
but
i
trust
it
is
not
so
here
i
feel
a
great
enlargement
in
this
young
man
presence
notwithstanding
a
certain
license
in
his
language
which
i
shall
use
my
efforts
to
correct
i
think
he
is
very
coarse
and
rude
said
esther
with
a
touch
of
temper
in
her
voice
but
he
speaks
better
english
than
most
of
our
visitors
what
is
his
occupation
watch
and
clock
making
by
which
together
with
a
little
teaching
as
i
understand
he
hopes
to
maintain
his
mother
not
thinking
it
right
that
he
should
live
by
the
sale
of
medicines
whose
virtues
he
distrusts
it
is
no
common
scruple
dear
me
said
esther
i
thought
he
was
something
higher
than
that
she
was
disappointed
felix
on
his
side
as
he
strolled
out
in
the
evening
air
said
to
himself
now
by
what
fine
meshes
of
circumstance
did
that
queer
devout
old
man
with
his
awful
creed
which
makes
this
world
a
vestibule
with
double
doors
to
hell
and
a
narrow
stair
on
one
side
whereby
the
thinner
sort
may
mount
to
heaven
by
what
subtle
play
of
flesh
and
spirit
did
he
come
to
have
a
daughter
so
little
in
his
own
likeness
married
foolishly
i
suppose
i
never
marry
though
i
should
have
to
live
on
raw
turnips
to
subdue
my
flesh
i
never
look
back
and
say
had
a
fine
purpose
once
i
meant
to
keep
my
hands
clean
and
my
soul
upright
and
to
look
truth
in
the
face
but
pray
excuse
me
i
have
a
wife
and
children
i
must
lie
and
simper
a
little
else
they
starve
or
wife
is
nice
she
must
have
her
bread
well
buttered
and
her
feelings
will
be
hurt
if
she
is
not
thought
genteel
that
is
the
lot
miss
esther
is
preparing
for
some
man
or
other
i
could
grind
my
teeth
at
such
minxes
who
think
they
can
tell
everybody
what
is
the
correct
thing
and
the
utmost
stretch
of
their
ideas
will
not
place
them
on
a
level
with
the
intelligent
fleas
i
should
like
to
see
if
she
could
be
made
ashamed
of
herself
chapter
vi
though
she
be
dead
yet
let
me
think
she
lives
and
feed
my
mind
that
dies
for
want
of
her
marlowe
the
hardly
any
one
in
treby
who
thought
at
all
of
lyon
and
his
daughter
had
not
felt
the
same
sort
of
wonder
about
esther
as
felix
felt
she
was
not
much
liked
by
her
father
church
and
congregation
the
less
serious
observed
that
she
had
too
many
airs
and
graces
and
held
her
head
much
too
high
the
stricter
sort
feared
greatly
that
lyon
had
not
been
sufficiently
careful
in
placing
his
daughter
among
people
and
that
being
led
astray
by
the
melancholy
vanity
of
giving
her
exceptional
accomplishments
he
had
sent
her
to
a
french
school
and
allowed
her
to
take
situations
where
she
had
contracted
notions
not
only
above
her
own
rank
but
of
too
worldly
a
kind
to
be
safe
in
any
rank
but
no
one
knew
what
sort
of
woman
her
mother
had
been
for
lyon
never
spoke
of
his
past
domesticities
when
he
was
chosen
as
pastor
at
treby
in
it
was
understood
that
he
had
been
a
widower
many
years
and
he
had
no
companion
but
the
tearful
and
lyddy
his
daughter
being
still
at
school
it
was
only
two
years
ago
that
esther
had
come
home
to
live
permanently
with
her
father
and
take
pupils
in
the
town
within
that
time
she
had
excited
a
passion
in
two
young
dissenting
breasts
that
were
clad
in
the
best
style
of
treby
waistcoat
a
garment
which
at
that
period
displayed
much
design
both
in
the
stuff
and
the
wearer
and
she
had
secured
an
astonished
admiration
of
her
cleverness
from
the
girls
of
various
ages
who
were
her
pupils
indeed
her
knowledge
of
french
was
generally
held
to
give
a
distinction
to
treby
itself
as
compared
with
other
but
she
had
won
little
regard
of
any
other
kind
wise
dissenting
matrons
were
divided
between
fear
lest
their
sons
should
want
to
marry
her
and
resentment
that
she
should
treat
those
undeniable
young
men
with
a
distant
scorn
which
was
hardly
to
be
tolerated
in
a
minister
daughter
not
only
because
that
parentage
appeared
to
entail
an
obligation
to
show
an
exceptional
degree
of
christian
humility
but
because
looked
at
from
a
secular
point
of
view
a
poor
minister
must
be
below
the
substantial
householders
who
keep
him
for
at
that
time
the
preacher
who
was
paid
under
the
voluntary
system
was
regarded
by
his
flock
with
feelings
not
less
mixed
than
the
spiritual
person
who
still
took
his
or
his
his
gifts
were
admired
and
tears
were
shed
under
best
bonnets
at
his
sermons
but
the
weaker
tea
was
thought
good
enough
for
him
and
even
when
he
went
to
preach
a
charity
sermon
in
a
strange
town
he
was
treated
with
wine
and
the
smaller
bedroom
as
the
good
churchman
reverence
was
often
mixed
with
growling
and
was
apt
to
be
given
chiefly
to
an
abstract
parson
who
was
what
a
parson
ought
to
be
so
the
good
dissenter
sometimes
mixed
his
approval
of
ministerial
gifts
with
considerable
criticism
and
cheapening
of
the
human
vessel
which
contained
those
treasures
muscat
and
nuttwood
applied
the
principle
of
christian
equality
by
remarking
that
lyon
had
his
oddities
and
that
he
ought
not
to
allow
his
daughter
to
indulge
in
such
unbecoming
expenditure
on
her
gloves
shoes
and
hosiery
even
if
she
did
pay
for
them
out
of
her
earnings
as
for
the
church
people
who
engaged
miss
lyon
to
give
lessons
in
their
families
their
imaginations
were
altogether
prostrated
by
the
incongruity
between
accomplishments
and
dissent
between
weekly
and
a
conversance
with
so
lively
and
altogether
worldly
a
language
as
the
french
esther
own
mind
was
not
free
from
a
sense
of
irreconcilableness
between
the
objects
of
her
taste
and
the
conditions
of
her
lot
she
knew
that
dissenters
were
looked
down
upon
by
those
whom
she
regarded
as
the
most
refined
classes
her
favorite
companions
both
in
france
and
at
an
english
school
where
she
had
been
a
junior
teacher
had
thought
it
quite
ridiculous
to
have
a
father
who
was
a
dissenting
preacher
and
when
an
ardently
admiring
induced
her
parents
to
take
esther
as
a
governess
to
the
younger
children
all
her
native
tendencies
toward
luxury
fastidiousness
and
scorn
of
mock
gentility
were
strengthened
by
witnessing
the
habits
of
a
and
wealthy
family
yet
the
position
of
servitude
was
irksome
to
her
and
she
was
glad
at
last
to
live
at
home
with
her
father
for
though
throughout
her
girlhood
she
had
wished
to
avoid
this
lot
a
little
experience
had
taught
her
to
prefer
its
comparative
independence
but
she
was
not
contented
with
her
life
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
surrounded
with
ignoble
uninteresting
conditions
from
which
there
was
no
issue
for
even
if
she
had
been
unamiable
enough
to
give
her
father
pain
deliberately
it
would
have
been
no
satisfaction
to
her
to
go
to
treby
church
and
visibly
turn
her
back
on
dissent
it
was
not
religious
differences
but
social
differences
that
esther
was
concerned
about
and
her
ambitious
taste
would
have
been
no
more
gratified
in
the
society
of
the
waces
than
in
that
of
the
muscats
the
waces
spoke
imperfect
english
and
played
whist
the
muscats
spoke
the
same
dialect
and
took
in
the
evangelical
magazine
esther
liked
neither
of
these
amusements
she
had
one
of
those
exceptional
organizations
which
are
quick
and
sensitive
without
being
in
the
least
morbid
she
was
alive
to
the
finest
shades
of
manner
to
the
nicest
distinctions
of
tone
and
accent
she
had
a
little
code
of
her
own
about
scents
and
colors
textures
and
behavior
by
which
she
secretly
condemned
or
sanctioned
all
things
and
persons
and
she
was
well
satisfied
with
herself
for
her
fastidious
taste
never
doubting
that
hers
was
the
highest
standard
she
was
proud
that
the
and
handsomest
girls
at
school
had
always
said
that
she
might
be
taken
for
a
born
lady
her
own
pretty
instep
clad
in
a
silk
stocking
her
little
heel
just
rising
from
a
kid
slipper
her
irreproachable
nails
and
delicate
wrist
were
the
objects
of
delighted
consciousness
to
her
and
she
felt
that
it
was
her
superiority
which
made
her
unable
to
use
without
disgust
any
but
the
finest
cambric
handkerchiefs
and
freshest
gloves
her
money
all
went
in
the
gratification
of
these
nice
tastes
and
she
saved
nothing
from
her
earnings
i
can
not
say
that
she
had
pangs
of
conscience
on
this
score
for
she
felt
sure
that
she
was
generous
she
hated
all
meanness
would
empty
her
purse
impulsively
on
some
sudden
appeal
to
her
pity
and
if
she
found
out
that
her
father
had
a
want
she
would
supply
it
with
some
pretty
device
of
a
surprise
but
then
the
good
man
so
seldom
had
a
want
except
the
perpetual
desire
which
she
could
never
gratify
of
seeing
her
under
convictions
and
fit
to
become
a
member
of
the
church
as
for
little
lyon
he
loved
and
admired
this
unregenerate
child
more
he
feared
than
was
consistent
with
the
due
preponderance
of
impersonal
and
ministerial
regards
he
prayed
and
pleaded
for
her
with
tears
humbling
himself
for
her
spiritual
deficiencies
in
the
privacy
of
his
study
and
then
came
down
stairs
to
find
himself
in
timorous
subjection
to
her
wishes
lest
as
he
inwardly
said
he
should
give
his
teaching
an
ill
savor
by
mingling
it
with
outward
crossing
there
will
be
queens
in
spite
of
salic
or
other
laws
of
later
date
than
adam
and
eve
and
here
in
this
small
dingy
house
of
the
minister
in
malthouse
yard
there
was
a
queen
esther
the
stronger
will
always
rule
say
some
with
an
air
of
confidence
which
is
like
a
lawyer
flourish
forbidding
exceptions
or
additions
but
what
is
strength
is
it
blind
wilfulness
that
sees
no
terrors
no
consequences
no
bruises
and
wounds
of
those
whose
cords
it
tightens
is
it
the
narrowness
of
a
brain
that

esther
had
affection
for
her
father
she
recognized
the
purity
of
his
character
and
a
quickness
of
intellect
in
him
which
responded
to
her
own
liveliness
in
spite
of
what
seemed
a
dreary
piety
which
selected
everything
that
was
least
interesting
and
romantic
in
life
and
history
but
his
old
clothes
had
a
smoky
odor
and
she
did
not
like
to
walk
with
him
because
when
people
spoke
to
him
in
the
street
it
was
his
wont
instead
of
remarking
on
the
weather
and
passing
on
to
pour
forth
in
an
absent
manner
some
reflections
that
were
occupying
his
mind
about
the
traces
of
the
divine
government
or
about
a
peculiar
incident
narrated
in
the
life
of
the
eminent
richard
baxter
esther
had
a
horror
of
appearing
ridiculous
even
in
the
eyes
of
vulgar
trebians
she
fancied
that
she
should
have
loved
her
mother
better
than
she
was
able
to
love
her
father
and
she
wished
she
could
have
remembered
that
mother
more
thoroughly
but
she
had
no
more
than
a
broken
vision
of
the
time
before
she
was
five
years
old
the
time
when
the
word
oftenest
on
her
lips
was
mamma
when
a
low
voice
spoke
caressing
french
words
to
her
and
she
in
her
turn
repeated
the
words
to
her
rag
doll
when
a
very
small
white
hand
different
from
any
that
came
after
used
to
pat
her
and
stroke
her
and
tie
on
her
frock
and
pinafore
and
when
at
last
there
was
nothing
but
sitting
with
a
doll
on
a
bed
where
mamma
was
lying
till
her
father
once
carried
her
away
where
distinct
memory
began
there
was
no
longer
the
low
caressing
voice
and
the
small
white
hand
she
knew
that
her
mother
was
a
frenchwoman
that
she
had
been
in
want
and
distress
and
that
her
maiden
name
was
annette
ledru
her
father
had
told
her
no
more
than
this
and
once
he
had
said
my
esther
until
you
are
a
woman
we
will
only
think
of
your
mother
when
you
are
about
to
be
married
and
leave
me
we
will
speak
of
her
and
i
will
deliver
to
you
her
ring
and
all
that
was
hers
but
without
a
great
command
laid
upon
me
i
can
not
pierce
my
heart
by
speaking
of
that
which
was
and
is
not
esther
had
never
forgotten
these
words
and
the
older
she
became
the
more
impossible
she
felt
it
that
she
should
urge
her
father
with
questions
about
the
past
his
inability
to
speak
of
that
past
to
her
depended
on
manifold
causes
partly
it
came
from
an
initial
concealment
he
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
esther
that
he
was
not
really
her
father
he
had
not
the
courage
to
renounce
that
hold
on
her
tenderness
which
the
belief
in
his
natural
fatherhood
must
help
to
give
him
or
to
incur
any
resentment
that
her
quick
spirit
might
feel
at
having
been
brought
up
under
a
false
supposition
but
there
were
other
things
yet
more
difficult
for
him
to
be
quite
open
about
deep
sorrows
of
his
life
as
a
christian
minister
that
were
hardly
to
be
told
to
a
girl
years
ago
when
rufus
lyon
was
no
more
than
years
old
he
was
the
admired
pastor
of
a
large
independent
congregation
in
one
of
our
southern
seaport
towns
he
was
unmarried
and
had
met
all
exhortations
of
friends
who
represented
to
him
that
a
bishop
the
overseer
of
an
independent
church
and
congregation
should
be
the
husband
of
one
wife
by
saying
that
paul
meant
this
particular
as
a
limitation
and
not
as
an
injunction
that
a
minister
was
permitted
to
have
one
wife
but
that
he
rufus
lyon
did
not
wish
to
avail
himself
of
that
permission
finding
his
studies
and
other
labors
of
his
vocation
and
seeing
that
mothers
in
israel
were
sufficiently
provided
by
those
who
had
not
been
set
apart
for
a
more
special
work
his
church
and
congregation
were
proud
of
him
he
was
put
forward
on
platforms
was
made
a
deputation
and
was
requested
to
preach
anniversary
sermons
in
towns
wherever
noteworthy
preachers
were
discussed
rufus
lyon
was
almost
sure
to
be
mentioned
as
one
who
did
honor
to
the
independent
body
his
sermons
were
said
to
be
full
of
fire
and
while
he
had
more
of
human
knowledge
than
many
of
his
brethren
he
showed
in
an
eminent
degree
the
marks
of
a
true
ministerial
vocation
but
on
a
sudden
this
burning
and
shining
light
seemed
to
be
quenched
lyon
voluntarily
resigned
his
charge
and
withdrew
from
the
town
a
terrible
crisis
had
come
upon
him
a
moment
in
which
religious
doubt
and
passion
had
rushed
together
in
a
common
flood
and
had
paralyzed
his
ministerial
gifts
his
years
had
been
a
story
of
purely
religious
and
studious
fervor
his
passion
had
been
for
doctrines
for
argumentative
conquest
on
the
side
of
right
the
sins
he
had
chiefly
to
pray
against
had
been
those
of
personal
ambition
under
such
forms
as
ambition
takes
in
the
mind
of
a
man
who
has
chosen
the
career
of
an
independent
preacher
and
those
of
a
too
restless
intellect
ceaselessly
urging
questions
concerning
the
mystery
of
that
which
was
assuredly
revealed
and
thus
hindering
the
due
nourishment
of
the
soul
on
the
substance
of
the
truth
delivered
even
at
that
time
of
comparative
youth
his
unworldliness
and
simplicity
in
small
matters
for
he
was
keenly
awake
to
the
larger
affairs
of
this
world
gave
a
certain
oddity
to
his
manners
and
appearance
and
though
his
sensitive
face
had
much
beauty
his
person
altogether
seemed
so
irrelevant
to
a
fashionable
view
of
things
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
usually
laughed
at
him
as
they
probably
did
at
john
milton
after
the
restoration
and
ribbons
had
come
in
and
still
more
at
that
apostle
of
weak
bodily
presence
who
preached
in
the
back
streets
of
ephesus
and
elsewhere
a
new
view
of
a
religion
that
hardly
anybody
believed
in
rufus
lyon
was
the
apostle
of
the
meeting
in
lane
was
it
likely
that
any
romance
should
befall
such
a
man
perhaps
not
but
romance
did
befall
him
one
winter
evening
in
lyon
was
returning
from
a
village
preaching
he
walked
at
his
usual
rapid
rate
with
busy
thoughts
undisturbed
by
any
sight
more
distinct
than
the
bushes
and
the
hedgerow
trees
black
beneath
a
faint
moonlight
until
something
suggested
to
him
that
he
had
perhaps
omitted
to
bring
away
with
him
a
thin
in
which
he
recorded
certain
subscriptions
he
paused
unfastened
his
outer
coat
and
felt
in
all
his
pockets
then
he
took
off
his
hat
and
looked
inside
it
the
book
was
not
to
be
found
and
he
was
about
to
walk
on
when
he
was
startled
by
hearing
a
low
sweet
voice
say
with
a
strong
foreign
accent
have
pity
on
me
sir
searching
with
his
eyes
he
perceived
some
one
on
a
and
approaching
he
found
a
young
woman
with
a
baby
on
her
lap
she
spoke
again
more
faintly
than
before
sir
i
die
with
hunger
in
the
name
of
god
take
the
little
one
there
was
no
distrusting
the
pale
face
and
the
sweet
low
voice
without
pause
lyon
took
the
baby
in
his
arms
and
said
can
you
walk
by
my
side
young
woman
she
rose
but
seemed
tottering
lean
on
me
said
lyon
and
so
they
walked
slowly
on
the
minister
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
carrying
a
baby
nothing
better
occurred
to
him
than
to
take
his
charge
to
his
own
house
it
was
the
simplest
way
of
relieving
the
woman
wants
and
finding
out
how
she
could
be
helped
further
and
he
thought
of
no
other
possibilities
she
was
too
feeble
for
more
words
to
be
spoken
between
them
till
she
was
seated
by
his
fireside
his
elderly
servant
was
not
easily
amazed
at
anything
her
master
did
in
the
way
of
charity
and
at
once
took
the
baby
while
lyon
unfastened
the
mother
damp
bonnet
and
shawl
and
gave
her
something
warm
to
drink
then
waiting
by
her
till
it
was
time
to
offer
her
more
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
notice
the
loveliness
of
her
face
which
seemed
to
him
as
that
of
an
angel
with
a
benignity
in
its
repose
that
carried
a
more
assured
sweetness
than
any
smile
gradually
she
revived
lifted
up
her
delicate
hands
between
her
face
and
the
firelight
and
looked
at
the
baby
which
lay
opposite
to
her
on
the
old
servant
lap
taking
in
spoonfuls
with
much
content
and
stretching
out
naked
feet
toward
the
warmth
then
as
her
consciousness
of
relief
grew
into
contrasting
memory
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
to
lyon
who
stood
close
by
her
and
said
in
her
pretty
broken
way
i
knew
you
had
a
good
heart
when
you
took
your
hat
off
you
seemed
to
me
as
the
image
of
the
saint
the
grateful
glance
of
those
eyes
with
their
long
eyelashes
was
a
new
kind
of
good
to
rufus
lyon
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
woman
had
never
really
looked
at
him
before
yet
this
poor
thing
was
apparently
a
blind
french
catholic
of
delicate
nurture
surely
judging
from
her
hands
he
was
in
a
tremor
he
felt
that
it
would
be
rude
to
question
her
and
he
only
urged
her
now
to
take
a
little
food
she
accepted
it
with
evident
enjoyment
looking
at
the
child
continually
and
then
with
a
fresh
burst
of
gratitude
leaning
forward
to
press
the
servant
hand
and
say
oh
you
are
good
then
she
looked
up
at
lyon
again
and
said
is
there
in
the
world
a
prettier
the
evening
passed
a
bed
was
made
up
for
the
strange
woman
and
lyon
had
not
asked
her
so
much
as
her
name
he
never
went
to
bed
himself
that
night
he
spent
it
in
misery
enduring
a
horrible
assault
of
satan
he
thought
a
frenzy
had
seized
him
wild
visions
of
an
impossible
future
thrust
themselves
upon
him
he
dreaded
lest
the
woman
had
a
husband
he
wished
that
he
might
call
her
his
own
that
he
might
worship
her
beauty
that
she
might
love
and
caress
him
and
what
to
the
mass
of
men
would
have
been
only
one
of
many
allowable
follies
a
transient
fascination
to
be
dispelled
by
daylight
and
contact
with
those
common
facts
of
which
is
the
reflex
was
to
him
a
spiritual
convulsion
he
was
as
one
who
raved
and
knew
that
he
raved
these
mad
wishes
were
irreconcilable
with
what
he
was
and
must
be
as
a
christian
minister
nay
penetrating
his
soul
as
tropic
heat
penetrates
the
frame
and
changes
for
it
all
aspects
and
all
flavors
they
were
irreconcilable
with
that
conception
of
the
world
which
made
his
faith
all
the
busy
doubt
which
had
before
been
mere
impish
shadows
flitting
around
a
belief
that
was
strong
with
the
strength
of
an
unswerving
moral
bias
had
now
gathered
blood
and
substance
the
questioning
spirit
had
become
suddenly
bold
and
blasphemous
it
no
longer
insinuated
scepticism
it
prompted
defiance
it
no
longer
expressed
cool
inquisitive
thought
but
was
the
voice
of
a
passionate
mood
yet
he
never
ceased
to
regard
it
as
the
voice
of
the
tempter
the
conviction
which
had
been
the
law
of
his
better
life
remained
within
him
as
a
conscience
the
struggle
of
that
night
was
an
abridgment
of
all
the
struggles
that
came
after
quick
souls
have
their
intensest
life
in
the
first
anticipatory
sketch
of
what
may
or
will
be
and
the
pursuit
of
their
wish
is
the
pursuit
of
that
paradisiacal
vision
which
only
impelled
them
and
is
left
farther
and
farther
behind
vanishing
forever
even
out
of
hope
in
the
moment
which
is
called
success
the
next
morning
lyon
heard
his
guest
history
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
french
officer
of
considerable
rank
who
had
fallen
in
the
russian
campaign
she
had
escaped
from
france
to
england
with
much
difficulty
in
order
to
rejoin
her
husband
a
young
englishman
to
whom
she
had
become
attached
during
his
detention
as
a
prisoner
of
war
on
parole
at
vesoul
where
she
was
living
under
the
charge
of
some
relatives
and
to
whom
she
had
been
married
without
the
consent
of
her
family
her
husband
had
served
in
the
hanoverian
army
had
obtained
his
discharge
in
order
to
visit
england
on
some
business
with
the
nature
of
which
she
was
not
acquainted
and
had
been
taken
prisoner
as
a
suspected
spy
a
short
time
after
their
marriage
he
and
his
had
been
moved
to
a
town
nearer
the
coast
and
she
had
remained
in
wretched
uncertainty
about
him
until
at
last
a
letter
had
come
from
him
telling
her
that
an
exchange
of
prisoners
had
occurred
that
he
was
in
england
that
she
must
use
her
utmost
effort
to
follow
him
and
that
on
arriving
on
english
ground
she
must
send
him
word
under
a
cover
which
he
enclosed
bearing
an
address
in
london
fearing
the
opposition
of
her
friends
she
started
unknown
to
them
with
a
very
small
supply
of
money
and
after
enduring
much
discomfort
and
many
fears
in
waiting
for
a
passage
which
she
at
last
got
in
a
small
trading
smack
she
arrived
at
southampton
before
she
was
able
to
write
her
baby
was
born
and
before
her
husband
answer
came
she
had
been
obliged
to
pawn
some
clothes
and
trinkets
he
desired
her
to
travel
to
london
where
he
would
meet
her
at
the
belle
sauvage
adding
that
he
was
himself
in
distress
and
unable
to
come
to
her
when
once
she
was
in
london
they
would
take
ship
and
quit
the
country
arrived
at
the
belle
sauvage
the
poor
thing
waited
three
days
in
vain
for
her
husband
on
the
fourth
a
letter
came
in
a
strange
hand
saying
that
in
his
last
moments
he
had
desired
this
letter
to
be
written
to
inform
her
of
his
death
and
recommend
her
to
return
to
her
friends
she
could
choose
no
other
course
but
she
had
soon
been
reduced
to
walking
that
she
might
save
her
pence
to
buy
bread
with
and
on
the
evening
when
she
made
her
appeal
to
lyon
she
had
pawned
the
last
thing
over
and
above
needful
clothing
that
she
could
persuade
herself
to
part
with
the
things
she
had
not
borne
to
part
with
were
her
and
a
locket
containing
her
husband
hair
and
bearing
his
baptismal
name
this
locket
she
said
exactly
resembled
one
worn
by
her
husband
on
his
only
that
his
bore
the
name
annette
and
contained
a
lock
of
her
hair
the
precious
trifle
now
hung
round
her
neck
by
a
cord
for
she
had
sold
the
small
gold
chain
which
formerly
held
it
the
only
guarantee
of
this
story
besides
the
exquisite
candor
of
her
face
was
a
small
packet
of
papers
which
she
carried
in
her
pocket
consisting
of
her
husband
few
letters
the
letter
which
announced
his
death
and
her
marriage
certificate
it
was
not
so
probable
a
story
as
that
of
many
an
inventive
vagrant
but
lyon
did
not
doubt
it
for
a
moment
it
was
impossible
to
him
to
suspect
this
woman
but
he
had
strong
suspicions
concerning
her
husband
he
could
not
help
being
glad
that
she
had
not
retained
the
address
he
had
desired
her
to
send
to
in
london
as
that
removed
any
obvious
means
of
learning
particulars
about
him
but
enquiries
might
have
been
made
at
vesoul
by
letter
and
her
friends
there
might
have
been
appealed
to
a
consciousness
not
to
be
quite
silenced
told
lyon
that
this
was
the
course
he
ought
to
take
but
it
would
have
required
an
energetic
and
he
was
excused
from
it
by
annette
own
disinclination
to
return
to
her
relatives
if
any
other
acceptable
possibility
could
be
found
he
dreaded
with
a
violence
of
feeling
which
surmounted
all
struggles
lest
anything
should
take
her
away
and
place
such
barriers
between
them
as
would
make
it
unlikely
or
impossible
that
she
should
ever
love
him
well
enough
to
become
his
wife
yet
he
saw
with
perfect
clearness
that
unless
he
tore
up
his
mad
passion
by
the
roots
his
ministerial
usefulness
would
be
frustrated
and
the
repose
of
his
soul
would
be
destroyed
this
woman
was
an
unregenerate
catholic
ten
listening
to
her
artless
talk
made
that
plain
to
him
even
if
her
position
had
been
less
equivocal
to
unite
himself
to
such
a
woman
was
nothing
less
than
a
spiritual
fall
it
was
already
a
fall
that
he
had
wished
there
was
no
high
purpose
to
which
he
owed
an
allegiance
that
he
had
longed
to
fly
to
some
backwoods
where
there
was
no
church
to
reproach
him
and
where
he
might
have
this
sweet
woman
to
wife
and
to
know
the
joys
of
tenderness
those
sensibilities
which
in
most
lives
are
diffused
equally
through
the
youthful
years
were
aroused
suddenly
in
lyon
as
some
men
have
their
special
genius
revealed
to
them
by
a
tardy
concurrence
of
conditions
his
love
was
the
first
love
of
a
fresh
young
heart
full
of
wonder
and
worship
but
what
to
one
man
is
the
virtue
which
he
has
sunk
below
the
possibility
of
aspiring
to
is
to
another
the
backsliding
by
which
he
forfeits
his
spiritual
crown
the
end
was
that
annette
remained
in
his
house
he
had
striven
against
himself
so
far
as
to
represent
her
position
to
some
chief
matrons
in
his
congregation
praying
and
yet
dreading
that
they
would
so
take
her
by
the
hand
as
to
impose
on
him
that
denial
of
his
own
longing
not
to
let
her
go
out
of
his
sight
which
he
found
it
too
hard
to
impose
on
himself
but
they
regarded
the
case
coldly
the
woman
was
after
all
a
vagrant
lyon
was
observed
to
be
surprisingly
weak
on
the
subject
his
eagerness
seemed
disproportionate
and
unbecoming
and
this
young
frenchwoman
unable
to
express
herself
very
clearly
was
no
more
interesting
to
those
matrons
and
their
husbands
than
other
pretty
young
women
suspiciously
circumstanced
they
were
willing
to
subscribe
something
to
carry
her
on
her
way
or
if
she
took
some
lodgings
they
would
give
her
a
little
sewing
and
endeavor
to
convert
her
from
papistry
if
however
she
was
a
respectable
person
as
she
said
the
only
proper
thing
for
her
was
to
go
back
to
her
own
country
and
friends
in
spite
of
himself
lyon
exulted
there
seemed
a
reason
now
that
he
should
keep
annette
under
his
own
eyes
he
told
himself
that
no
real
object
would
be
served
by
his
providing
food
and
lodging
for
her
elsewhere
an
expense
which
he
could
ill
afford
and
she
was
apparently
so
helpless
except
as
to
the
one
task
of
attending
to
her
baby
that
it
would
have
been
folly
to
think
of
her
exerting
herself
for
her
own
support
but
this
course
of
his
was
severely
disapproved
by
his
church
there
were
various
signs
that
the
minister
was
under
some
evil
influence
his
preaching
wanted
its
old
fervor
he
seemed
to
shun
the
intercourse
of
his
brethren
and
very
mournful
suspicions
were
entertained
a
formal
remonstrance
was
presented
to
him
but
he
met
it
as
if
he
had
already
determined
to
act
in
anticipation
of
it
he
admitted
that
external
circumstances
conjoined
with
a
peculiar
state
of
mind
were
likely
to
hinder
the
fruitful
exercise
of
his
ministry
and
he
resigned
it
there
was
much
sorrowing
much
expostulation
but
he
declared
that
for
the
present
he
was
unable
to
unfold
himself
more
fully
he
only
wished
to
state
solemnly
that
annette
ledru
though
blind
in
spiritual
things
was
in
a
worldly
sense
a
pure
and
virtuous
woman
no
more
was
to
be
said
and
he
departed
to
a
distant
town
here
he
maintained
himself
annette
and
the
child
with
the
remainder
of
his
stipend
and
with
the
wages
he
earned
as
a
printer
reader
annette
was
one
of
those
helpless
women
who
take
all
things
as
manna
from
heaven
the
good
image
of
the
saint
john
wished
her
to
stay
with
him
and
there
was
nothing
else
that
she
wished
for
except
the
unattainable
yet
for
a
whole
year
lyon
never
dared
to
tell
annette
that
he
loved
her
he
trembled
before
this
woman
he
saw
that
the
idea
of
his
being
her
lover
was
too
remote
from
her
mind
for
her
to
have
any
idea
that
she
ought
not
to
live
with
him
she
had
never
known
never
asked
the
reason
why
he
gave
up
his
ministry
she
seemed
to
entertain
as
little
concern
about
the
strange
world
in
which
she
lived
as
a
bird
in
its
nest
an
avalanche
had
fallen
over
the
past
but
she
sat
warm
and
uncrushed
there
was
food
for
many
morrows
and
her
baby
flourished
she
did
not
seem
even
to
care
about
a
priest
or
about
having
her
child
baptized
and
on
the
subject
of
religion
lyon
was
as
timid
and
shrank
as
much
from
speaking
to
her
as
on
the
subject
of
his
love
he
dreaded
anything
that
might
cause
her
to
feel
a
sudden
repulsion
toward
him
he
dreaded
disturbing
her
simple
gratitude
and
content
in
these
days
his
religious
faith
was
not
slumbering
it
was
awake
and
achingly
conscious
of
having
fallen
in
a
struggle
he
had
had
a
great
treasure
committed
to
him
and
had
flung
it
away
he
held
himself
a
backslider
his
unbelieving
thoughts
never
gained
the
full
ear
and
consent
of
his
soul
his
prayers
had
been
stifled
by
the
sense
that
there
was
something
he
preferred
to
complete
obedience
they
had
ceased
to
be
anything
but
intermittent
cries
and
confessions
and
a
submissive
presentiment
rising
at
times
even
to
an
entreaty
that
some
great
discipline
might
come
that
the
dull
spiritual
sense
might
be
roused
to
full
vision
and
hearing
as
of
old
and
the
supreme
facts
become
again
supreme
in
his
soul
lyon
will
perhaps
seem
a
very
simple
personage
with
pitiably
narrow
theories
but
none
of
our
theories
are
quite
large
enough
for
all
the
disclosures
of
time
and
to
the
end
of
men
struggles
a
penalty
will
remain
for
those
who
sink
from
the
ranks
of
the
heroes
into
the
crowd
for
whom
the
heroes
fight
and
die
one
day
however
annette
learned
lyon
secret
the
baby
had
a
tooth
coming
and
being
large
and
strong
now
was
noisily
fretful
lyon
though
he
had
been
working
extra
hours
and
was
much
in
need
of
repose
took
the
child
from
its
mother
immediately
on
entering
the
house
and
walked
about
with
it
patting
and
talking
soothingly
to
it
the
stronger
grasp
the
new
sensations
were
a
successful
anodyne
and
baby
went
to
sleep
on
his
shoulder
but
fearful
lest
any
movement
should
disturb
it
he
sat
down
and
endured
the
bondage
of
holding
it
still
against
his
shoulder
you
do
nurse
baby
well
said
annette
approvingly
yet
you
never
nursed
before
i
came
no
said
lyon
i
had
no
brothers
and
sisters
why
were
you
not
married
annette
had
never
thought
of
asking
that
question
before
because
i
never
loved
any
woman
till
now
i
thought
i
should
never
marry
now
i
wish
to
marry
annette
started
she
did
not
see
at
once
that
she
was
the
woman
he
wanted
to
marry
what
had
flashed
on
her
mind
was
that
there
might
be
a
great
change
in
lyon
life
it
was
as
if
the
lightning
had
entered
into
her
dream
and
half
awaked
her
do
you
think
it
foolish
annette
that
i
should
wish
to
marry
i
did
not
expect
it
she
said
doubtfully
i
did
not
know
you
thought
about
it
you
know
the
woman
i
should
like
to
marry
i
know
her
she
said
interrogatively
blushing
deeply
it
is
you
annette
you
whom
i
have
loved
better
than
my
duty
i
forsook
everything
for
you
lyon
paused
he
was
about
to
do
what
he
felt
would
be
ignoble
to
urge
what
seemed
like
a
claim
can
you
love
me
annette
will
you
be
my
wife
annette
trembled
and
looked
miserable
do
not
speak
forget
it
said
lyon
rising
suddenly
and
speaking
with
loud
energy
no
no
i
do
not
want
it
i
do
not
wish
it
the
baby
awoke
as
he
started
up
he
gave
the
child
into
annette
arms
and
left
her
his
work
took
him
away
early
the
next
morning
and
the
next
again
they
did
not
need
to
speak
much
to
each
other
the
third
day
lyon
was
too
ill
to
go
to
work
his
frame
had
been
overwrought
he
had
been
too
poor
to
have
sufficiently
nourishing
food
and
under
the
shattering
of
his
long
deferred
hope
his
health
had
given
away
they
had
no
regular
servant
only
occasional
help
from
an
old
woman
who
lit
the
fires
and
put
on
the
kettles
annette
was
forced
to
be
the
and
this
sudden
demand
on
her
shook
away
some
of
her
torpor
the
illness
was
a
serious
one
and
the
medical
man
one
day
hearing
lyon
in
his
delirium
raving
with
an
astonishing
fluency
in
biblical
language
suddenly
looked
round
with
increased
curiosity
at
annette
and
asked
if
she
were
the
sick
man
wife
or
some
other
relative
no
no
relation
said
annette
shaking
her
head
he
has
been
good
to
me
how
long
have
you
lived
with
him
more
than
a
year
was
he
a
preacher
once
yes
when
did
he
leave
off
being
a
preacher
soon
after
he
took
care
of
me
is
that
his
child
sir
said
annette
coloring
indignantly
i
am
a
widow
the
doctor
she
thought
looked
at
her
oddly
but
he
asked
no
more
questions
when
the
sick
man
was
getting
better
and
able
to
enjoy
invalid
food
he
observed
one
day
while
he
was
taking
some
broth
that
annette
was
looking
at
him
he
paused
to
look
at
her
in
return
and
was
struck
with
a
new
expression
in
her
face
quite
distinct
from
the
merely
passive
sweetness
which
usually
characterized
it
she
laid
her
little
hand
on
his
which
was
now
transparently
thin
and
said
i
am
getting
very
wise
i
have
sold
some
of
the
books
to
make
money
the
doctor
told
me
where
and
i
have
looked
into
the
shops
where
they
sell
caps
and
bonnets
and
pretty
things
and
i
can
do
all
that
and
get
more
money
to
keep
us
and
when
you
are
well
enough
to
get
up
we
will
go
out
and
be
married
shall
we
not
see
and
the
baby
had
never
been
named
anything
else
shall
call
you
papa
and
then
we
shall
never
part
lyon
trembled
this
illness
something
else
perhaps
had
made
a
great
change
in
annette
a
fortnight
after
that
they
were
married
the
day
before
he
had
ventured
to
ask
her
if
she
felt
any
difficulty
about
her
religion
and
if
she
would
consent
to
have
baptized
and
brought
up
as
a
protestant
she
shook
her
head
and
said
very
simply
no
in
france
in
other
days
i
would
have
minded
but
all
is
changed
i
never
was
fond
of
religion
but
i
knew
it
was
right
les
fleurs
les
bals
la
musique
et
mon
mari
qui
était
but
all
that
is
gone
away
there
is
nothing
of
my
religion
in
this
country
but
the
good
god
must
be
here
for
you
are
good
i
leave
all
to
you
it
was
clear
that
annette
regarded
her
present
life
as
a
sort
of
death
to
the
world
an
existence
on
a
remote
island
where
she
had
been
saved
from
wreck
she
was
too
indolent
mentally
too
little
interested
to
acquaint
herself
with
any
secrets
of
the
isle
the
transient
energy
the
more
vivid
consciousness
and
sympathy
which
had
been
stirred
in
her
during
lyon
illness
had
soon
subsided
into
the
old
apathy
to
everything
except
her
child
she
withered
like
a
plant
in
strange
air
and
the
three
years
of
life
that
remained
were
but
a
slow
and
gentle
death
those
three
years
were
to
lyon
a
period
of
such
and
life
in
another
as
few
men
know
strange
that
the
passion
for
this
woman
which
he
felt
to
have
drawn
him
aside
from
the
right
as
much
as
if
he
had
broken
the
most
solemn
vows
for
that
only
was
right
to
him
which
he
held
the
best
and
highest
the
passion
for
a
being
who
had
no
glimpse
of
his
thoughts
induced
a
more
thorough
renunciation
than
he
had
ever
known
in
the
time
of
his
complete
devotion
to
his
ministerial
career
he
had
no
flattery
now
either
from
himself
or
the
world
he
knew
that
he
had
fallen
and
world
had
forgotten
him
or
shook
their
heads
at
his
memory
the
only
satisfaction
he
had
was
the
satisfaction
of
his
tenderness
which
meant
untiring
work
untiring
patience
untiring
wakefulness
even
to
the
dumb
signs
of
feeling
in
a
creature
whom
he
alone
cared
for
the
day
of
parting
came
and
he
was
left
with
little
esther
as
the
one
visible
sign
of
that
four
years
break
in
his
life
a
year
afterward
he
entered
the
ministry
again
and
lived
with
the
utmost
sparingness
that
esther
might
be
so
educated
as
to
be
able
to
get
her
own
bread
in
case
of
his
death
her
probable
facility
in
acquiring
french
naturally
suggested
his
sending
her
to
a
french
school
which
would
give
her
a
special
advantage
as
a
teacher
it
was
a
protestant
school
and
french
protestantism
had
the
high
recommendation
of
being
it
was
understood
that
esther
would
contract
no
papistical
superstitions
and
this
was
perfectly
true
but
she
contracted
as
we
see
a
good
deal
of
vanity
lyon
reputation
as
a
preacher
and
devoted
pastor
had
revived
but
some
dissatisfaction
beginning
to
be
felt
by
his
congregation
at
a
certain
laxity
detected
by
them
in
his
views
as
to
the
limits
of
salvation
which
he
had
in
one
sermon
even
hinted
might
extend
to
unconscious
recipients
of
mercy
he
had
found
it
desirable
seven
years
ago
to
quit
this
ten
years
pastorate
and
accept
a
call
from
the
less
important
church
in
malthouse
yard
treby
magna
this
was
rufus
lyon
history
at
that
time
unknown
in
its
fullness
to
any
human
being
besides
himself
we
can
perhaps
guess
what
memories
they
were
that
relaxed
the
stringency
of
his
doctrine
on
the
point
of
salvation
in
the
deepest
of
all
senses
his
heart
said
though
she
be
dead
yet
let
me
think
she
lives
and
feed
my
mind
that
dies
for
want
of
her
chapter
vii
it
was
but
yesterday
you
spoke
him
well
you
changed
your
mind
so
soon
not
i
is
he
that
changing
to
my
thought
has
changed
my
mind
no
man
puts
rotten
apples
in
his
pouch
because
their
upper
side
looked
fair
to
him
constancy
in
mistake
is
constant
folly
the
news
that
the
rich
heir
of
the
transomes
was
actually
come
back
and
had
been
seen
at
treby
was
carried
to
some
one
else
who
had
more
reasons
for
being
interested
in
it
than
the
reverend
rufus
lyon
was
yet
conscious
of
having
it
was
owing
to
this
that
at
three
two
days
afterward
a
carriage
and
pair
with
coachman
and
footman
in
crimson
and
drab
passed
through
the
lodge
gates
at
transome
court
inside
there
was
a
hale
man
of
sixty
whose
hands
rested
on
a
knotted
stick
held
between
his
knees
and
a
lady
fat
and
a
mountain
of
satin
lace
and
exquisite
muslin
embroidery
they
were
not
persons
of
a
highly
remarkable
appearance
but
to
most
trebians
they
seemed
absolutely
unique
and
likely
to
be
known
anywhere
if
you
had
looked
down
upon
them
from
the
box
of
sampson
coach
he
would
have
said
after
lifting
his
hat
sir
maximus
and
his
lady
did
you
see
thinking
it
needless
to
add
the
surname
we
shall
find
her
greatly
elated
doubtless
lady
debarry
was
saying
she
has
been
in
the
shade
so
long
ah
poor
thing
said
sir
maximus
a
fine
woman
she
was
in
her
bloom
i
remember
the
first
county
ball
she
attended
we
were
all
ready
to
fight
for
the
sake
of
dancing
with
her
i
always
liked
her
from
that
time
i
never
swallowed
the
scandal
about
her
myself
if
we
are
to
be
intimate
with
her
said
lady
debarry
i
wish
you
would
avoid
making
such
allusions
sir
maximus
i
should
not
like
selina
and
harriet
to
hear
them
my
dear
i
should
have
forgotten
all
about
the
scandal
only
you
remind
me
of
it
sometimes
retorted
the
baronet
smiling
and
taking
out
his
these
sudden
turns
of
fortune
are
often
dangerous
to
an
excitable
constitution
said
lady
debarry
not
choosing
to
notice
her
epigram
poor
lady
alicia
methurst
got
from
a
sudden
piece
of
luck
the
death
of
her
uncle
you
know
if
transome
was
wise
she
would
go
to
town
she
can
afford
it
now
and
consult
truncheon
i
should
say
myself
he
would
order
her
digitalis
i
have
often
guessed
exactly
what
a
prescription
would
be
but
it
certainly
was
one
of
her
weak
points
to
think
she
understood
medicine
better
than
other
people
she
a
healthy
woman
enough
surely
see
how
upright
she
is
and
she
rides
about
like
a
girl
of
twenty
she
is
so
thin
that
she
makes
me
shudder
pooh
she
slim
and
active
women
are
not
bid
for
by
the
pound
pray
do
be
so
coarse
sir
maximus
laughed
and
showed
his
good
teeth
which
made
his
laughter
very
becoming
the
carriage
stopped
and
they
were
soon
ushered
to
transome
where
she
was
working
at
her
worsted
embroidery
a
little
daily
embroidery
had
been
a
constant
element
in
transome
life
but
that
soothing
occupation
of
taking
stitches
to
produce
what
neither
she
nor
any
one
else
wanted
was
then
the
resource
of
many
a
and
unhappy
woman
she
received
much
warm
congratulation
and
pressure
of
her
hand
with
perfect
composure
of
manner
but
she
became
paler
than
usual
and
her
hands
turned
quite
cold
the
debarrys
did
not
yet
know
what
politics
were
well
our
lucky
youngster
is
come
in
the
nick
of
time
said
sir
maximus
if
he
stand
he
and
philip
can
run
in
harness
together
and
keep
out
both
the
whigs
it
is
really
quite
a
providential
thing
his
returning
just
now
said
lady
debarry
i
could
help
thinking
that
something
would
occur
to
prevent
philip
from
having
such
a
man
as
peter
garstin
for
his
colleague
i
call
my
friend
harold
a
youngster
said
sir
maximus
for
you
know
i
remember
him
only
as
he
was
when
that
portrait
was
taken
that
is
a
long
while
ago
said
transome
my
son
is
much
altered
as
you
may
imagine
there
was
a
confused
sound
of
voices
in
the
library
while
this
talk
was
going
on
transome
chose
to
ignore
that
noise
but
her
face
from
being
pale
began
to
flush
a
little
yes
yes
on
the
outside
i
dare
say
but
he
was
a
fine
fellow
i
always
liked
him
and
if
anybody
should
ask
me
what
i
should
choose
for
the
good
of
the
country
i
could
have
thought
of
anything
better
than
having
a
young
transome
for
a
neighbor
who
will
take
an
active
part
the
transomes
and
the
debarrys
were
always
on
the
right
side
together
in
old
days
of
course
he
stand
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
it
the
need
for
an
answer
to
this
embarrassing
question
was
deferred
by
the
increase
of
inarticulate
sounds
accompanied
by
a
bark
from
the
library
and
the
sudden
appearance
at
the
doorway
of
old
transome
with
a
cord
around
his
waist
playing
a
very
horse
for
a
little
boy
about
three
years
old
who
was
urging
him
on
with
loud
encouraging
noises
and
occasional
thumps
from
a
stick
which
he
wielded
with
difficulty
the
old
man
paused
with
a
vague
smile
at
the
doorway
while
the
baronet
got
up
to
speak
to
him
nimrod
snuffed
at
his
master
legs
to
ascertain
that
he
was
not
hurt
and
the
little
boy
finding
something
new
to
be
looked
at
let
go
the
cord
and
came
round
in
front
of
the
company
dragging
his
stick
and
standing
at
a
safe
distance
as
he
fixed
his
great
black
eyes
on
lady
debarry
dear
me
what
a
splendid
little
boy
transome
why
it
can
not
be
can
it
be
that
you
have
the
happiness
to
be
a
grandmamma
yes
that
is
my
son
little
boy
indeed
said
lady
debarry
really
amazed
i
never
heard
you
speak
of
his
marriage
he
has
brought
you
home
a
then
no
said
transome
coldly
she
is
dead
o
o
oh
said
lady
debarry
in
a
tone
ludicrously
undecided
between
condolence
satisfaction
and
general
mistiness
how
very
singular
i
mean
that
we
should
not
have
heard
of
harold
marriage
but
he
a
charming
little
fellow
come
to
me
you
cherub
the
black
eyes
continued
fixed
as
if
by
a
sort
of
fascination
on
lady
debarry
face
and
her
affable
invitation
was
unheeded
at
last
putting
his
head
forward
and
pouting
his
lips
the
cherub
gave
forth
with
marked
intention
the
sounds
many
times
repeated
apparently
they
summed
up
his
opinion
of
lady
debarry
and
may
perhaps
have
meant
naughty
old
woman
but
his
speech
was
a
broken
lisping
polyglot
of
hazardous
interpretation
then
he
turned
to
pull
at
the
blenheim
spaniel
which
being
old
and
peevish
gave
a
little
snap
go
go
harry
let
poor
puff
alone
he
bite
you
said
transome
stooping
to
release
her
aged
pet
her
words
were
too
suggestive
for
harry
immediately
laid
hold
of
her
arm
with
his
teeth
and
bit
with
all
his
might
happily
the
stuffs
upon
it
were
some
protection
but
the
pain
forced
transome
to
give
a
low
cry
and
sir
maximus
who
had
now
turned
to
reseat
himself
shook
the
little
rascal
off
whereupon
he
burst
away
and
trotted
into
the
library
again
i
fear
you
are
hurt
said
lady
debarry
with
sincere
concern
what
a
little
savage
do
have
your
arm
attended
to
my
dear
i
recommend
fomentation
do
think
of
me
oh
thank
you
it
is
nothing
said
transome
biting
her
lip
and
smiling
alternately
it
will
soon
go
off
the
pleasures
of
being
a
grandmamma
you
perceive
the
child
has
taken
a
dislike
to
me
but
he
makes
quite
a
new
life
for
transome
they
were
playfellows
at
once
bless
my
heart
said
sir
maximus
it
is
odd
to
think
of
harold
having
been
a
family
man
so
long
i
made
up
my
mind
he
was
a
young
bachelor
what
an
old
stager
i
am
to
be
sure
and
whom
has
he
married
i
hope
we
shall
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
harold
transome
sir
maximus
occupied
with
old
transome
had
not
overheard
the
previous
conversation
on
that
subject
she
is
no
longer
living
lady
debarry
hastily
interposed
but
now
my
dear
sir
maximus
we
must
not
hinder
transome
from
attending
to
her
arm
i
am
sure
she
is
in
pain
do
say
another
word
my
dear
we
shall
see
you
again
you
and
harold
will
come
and
dine
with
us
on
thursday
say
yes
only
yes
sir
maximus
is
longing
to
see
him
and
philip
will
be
down
yes
yes
said
sir
maximus
he
must
lose
no
time
in
making
acquaintance
tell
him
philip
is
a
fine
fellow
carried
everything
before
him
at
oxford
and
your
son
must
be
returned
along
with
him
for
north
loamshire
you
said
he
meant
to
stand
i
will
write
and
let
you
know
if
harold
has
any
engagement
for
thursday
he
would
of
course
be
happy
otherwise
said
transome
evading
the
question
if
not
thursday
the
next
day
the
very
first
day
he
can
the
visitors
left
and
transome
was
almost
glad
of
the
painful
bite
which
had
saved
her
from
being
questioned
further
about
politics
this
is
the
last
visit
i
shall
receive
from
them
she
said
to
herself
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
she
rang
for
denner
that
poor
creature
is
not
happy
sir
maximus
said
lady
debarry
as
they
drove
along
something
annoys
her
about
her
son
i
hope
there
is
nothing
unpleasant
in
his
character
either
he
kept
his
marriage
a
secret
from
her
or
she
was
ashamed
of
it
he
is
at
least
by
this
time
after
living
in
the
east
so
long
he
may
have
become
a
sort
of
person
one
would
not
care
to
be
intimate
with
and
that
savage
boy
he
does
look
like
a
lady
child
pooh
my
dear
said
sir
maximus
women
think
so
much
of
those
minutiæ
in
the
present
state
of
the
country
it
is
our
duty
to
look
at
a
man
position
and
politics
philip
and
my
brother
are
both
of
that
opinion
and
i
think
they
know
what
right
if
any
man
does
we
are
bound
to
regard
every
man
of
our
party
as
a
public
instrument
and
to
pull
all
together
the
transomes
have
always
been
a
good
tory
family
but
it
has
been
a
cipher
of
late
years
this
young
fellow
coming
back
with
a
fortune
to
give
the
family
a
head
and
a
position
is
a
clear
gain
to
the
county
and
with
philip
he
get
into
the
right
hands
of
course
he
wants
guiding
having
been
out
of
the
country
so
long
all
we
have
to
ask
is
whether
a
man
a
tory
and
will
make
a
stand
for
the
good
of
the
country
that
the
plain
english
of
the
matter
and
i
do
beg
of
you
my
dear
to
set
aside
all
these
gossiping
niceties
and
exert
yourself
like
a
woman
of
sense
and
spirit
as
you
are
to
bring
the
right
people
together
here
sir
maximus
gave
a
deep
cough
took
out
his
and
tapped
it
he
had
made
a
serious
marital
speech
an
exertion
to
which
he
was
rarely
urged
by
anything
smaller
than
a
matter
of
conscience
and
this
outline
of
the
whole
duty
of
a
tory
was
a
matter
of
conscience
with
him
though
the
had
pointed
expressly
to
sir
maximus
debarry
amongst
others
in
branding
the
of
the
tories
as
a
conscious
selfishness
and
reckless
immorality
which
however
would
be
defeated
by
the
of
all
the
friends
of
truth
and
liberty
who
the
trusted
would
subordinate
all
differences
in
order
to
return
representatives
pledged
to
support
the
present
government
i
am
sure
sir
maximus
lady
debarry
answered
you
could
not
have
observed
that
anything
was
wanting
in
my
manners
to
mrs
transome
no
no
my
dear
but
i
say
this
by
way
of
caution
never
mind
what
was
done
at
smyrna
or
whether
transome
likes
to
sit
with
his
heels
tucked
up
we
may
surely
wink
at
a
few
things
for
the
sake
of
the
public
interest
if
god
almighty
does
and
if
he
did
i
do
know
what
would
have
become
of
the
country
government
could
never
have
been
carried
on
and
many
a
good
battle
would
have
been
lost
that
the
philosophy
of
the
matter
and
too
good
sir
maximus
gave
a
deep
cough
and
tapped
his
box
again
inwardly
remarking
that
if
he
had
not
been
such
a
lazy
fellow
he
might
have
made
as
good
a
figure
as
his
son
philip
but
at
this
point
the
carriage
which
was
rolling
by
a
turn
toward
treby
magna
passed
a
man
who
raised
his
hat
to
sir
maximus
and
called
to
the
coachman
to
stop
excuse
me
sir
maximus
said
this
personage
standing
uncovered
at
the
but
i
have
just
learned
something
of
importance
at
treby
which
i
thought
you
would
like
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
ah
what
that
something
about
garstin
or
clement
said
sir
maximus
seeing
the
other
draw
a
poster
from
his
pocket
no
rather
worse
i
fear
you
will
think
a
new
radical
candidate
i
got
this
by
a
stratagem
from
the
printer
boy
they
not
posted
yet
a
radical
said
sir
maximus
in
a
tone
of
incredulous
disgust
as
he
took
the
folded
bill
what
fool
is
he
he
have
no
chance
they
say
he
richer
than
garstin
harold
transome
shouted
sir
maximus
as
he
read
the
name
in
letters
i
do
believe
it
it
a
trick
it
a
squib
why
why
we
just
been
to
his
place
eh
do
you
know
any
more
speak
sir
speak
do
deal
out
your
story
like
a
damned
mountebank
who
wants
to
keep
people
gaping
sir
maximus
pray
do
give
way
so
said
lady
debarry
i
afraid
there
no
doubt
about
it
sir
said
christian
after
getting
the
bill
i
met
labron
clerk
and
he
said
he
had
just
had
the
whole
story
from
jermyn
clerk
the
ram
inn
is
engaged
already
and
a
committee
is
being
made
up
he
says
jermyn
goes
like
a
steam
engine
when
he
has
a
mind
although
he
makes
such
speeches
jermyn
be
hanged
for
a
rascal
tell
mitchell
to
drive
on
it
of
no
use
to
stay
chattering
here
jump
up
on
the
box
and
go
home
with
us
i
may
want
you
you
see
i
was
right
sir
maximus
said
the
baronet
wife
i
had
an
instinct
that
we
should
find
him
an
unpleasant
person
fudge
if
you
had
such
a
fine
instinct
why
did
you
let
us
go
to
transome
court
and
make
fools
of
ourselves
would
you
have
listened
to
me
but
of
course
you
will
not
have
him
to
dine
with
you
dine
with
me
i
should
think
not
i
sooner
he
should
dine
off
me
i
see
how
it
is
clearly
enough
he
has
become
a
regular
beast
among
those
mahometans
he
got
neither
religion
nor
morals
left
he
ca
know
any
thing
about
english
politics
he
go
and
cut
his
own
nose
off
as
a
landholder
and
never
know
however
he
wo
get
in
he
spend
his
money
for
nothing
i
fear
he
is
a
very
licentious
man
said
lady
debarry
we
know
now
why
his
mother
seemed
so
uneasy
i
should
think
she
reflects
a
little
poor
creature
it
a
confounded
nuisance
we
did
meet
christian
on
our
way
instead
of
coming
back
but
better
now
than
later
he
an
uncommonly
adroit
useful
fellow
that
factotum
of
philip
i
wish
phil
would
take
my
man
and
give
me
christian
i
make
him
he
might
reduce
the
accounts
a
little
perhaps
sir
maximus
would
not
have
been
so
sanguine
as
to
christian
economical
virtues
if
he
had
seen
that
gentleman
relaxing
himself
the
same
evening
among
the
other
distinguished
dependents
of
the
family
and
frequenters
of
the
steward
room
but
a
man
of
sir
rank
is
like
those
antediluvian
animals
whom
the
system
of
things
condemned
to
carry
such
a
huge
bulk
that
they
really
could
not
inspect
their
bodily
appurtenance
and
had
no
conception
of
their
own
tails
their
parasites
doubtless
had
a
merry
time
of
it
and
often
did
extremely
well
when
the
saurian
himself
was
ill
at
ease
treby
manor
measured
from
the
front
saloon
to
the
remotest
shed
was
as
large
as
a
village
and
there
were
certainly
more
lights
burning
in
it
every
evening
more
wine
spirits
and
ale
drunk
more
waste
and
more
folly
than
could
be
found
in
some
large
villages
there
was
fast
revelry
in
the
steward
room
and
slow
revelry
in
the
scotch
bailiff
room
short
whist
costume
and
flirtation
in
the
housekeeper
room
and
the
same
at
a
lower
price
in
the
servants
hall
a
select
olympian
feast
in
the
private
apartment
of
the
cook
who
was
a
much
grander
person
than
her
ladyship
and
wore
gold
and
jewelry
to
a
vast
amount
of
suet
a
gambling
group
in
the
stables
and
the
coachman
perhaps
the
most
innocent
member
of
the
establishment
tippling
in
majestic
solitude
by
a
fire
in
the

sir
maximus
as
every
one
said
was
a
gentleman
of
the
right
sort
condescended
to
no
mean
enquiries
greeted
his
with
a
gentlemen
when
he
met
them
in
the
park
and
only
snarled
in
a
subdued
way
when
he
looked
over
the
accounts
willing
to
endure
some
personal
inconvenience
in
order
to
keep
up
the
institutions
of
the
country
to
maintain
his
hereditary
establishment
and
do
his
duty
in
that
station
of
life
the
station
of
the
saurian
to
which
it
had
pleased
providence
to
call
him
the
focus
of
brilliancy
at
treby
manor
that
evening
was
in
no
way
the
where
sir
maximus
sipped
his
port
under
some
mental
depression
as
he
discussed
with
his
brother
the
reverend
augustus
the
sad
fact
that
one
of
the
oldest
names
in
the
county
was
to
be
on
the
wrong
side
not
in
the
where
miss
debarry
and
miss
selina
quietly
elegant
in
their
dress
and
manners
were
feeling
rather
dull
than
otherwise
having
finished
bulwer
eugene
aram
and
being
thrown
back
on
the
last
great
prose
work
of
southey
while
their
mamma
slumbered
a
little
on
the
sofa
no
the
centre
of
eager
talk
and
enjoyment
was
the
steward
room
where
scales
and
a
man
most
solicitous
about
his
boots
wristbands
the
roll
of
his
whiskers
and
other
attributes
of
a
gentleman
distributed
cigars
cognac
and
whiskey
to
various
colleagues
and
guests
who
were
discussing
with
that
freedom
of
conjecture
which
is
one
of
our
inalienable
privileges
as
britons
the
probable
amount
of
harold
transome
fortune
concerning
which
fame
had
already
been
busy
long
enough
to
have
acquired
vast
magnifying
power
the
chief
part
in
this
scene
was
undoubtedly
christian
although
he
had
hitherto
been
comparatively
silent
but
he
occupied
two
chairs
with
so
much
grace
throwing
his
right
leg
over
the
seat
of
the
second
and
resting
his
right
hand
on
the
back
he
held
his
cigar
and
displayed
a
splendid
with
such
becoming
nonchalance
and
had
his
gray
hair
arranged
with
so
much
taste
that
experienced
eyes
would
at
once
have
seen
even
the
great
scales
himself
to
be
but
a
secondary
character
why
said
crowder
an
old
respectable
tenant
though
much
in
arrear
as
to
his
rent
who
condescended
frequently
to
drink
in
the
steward
room
for
the
sake
of
the
conversation
why
i
suppose
they
get
money
so
fast
in
the
east
it
wonderful
why
he
went
on
with
a
hesitating
look
toward
scales
this
transome
got
a
matter
of
a
hundred
thousand
a
hundred
thousand
my
dear
sir
end
of
a
hundred
thousand
said
scales
with
a
contempt
very
painful
to
be
borne
by
a
modest
man
well
said
crowder
giving
way
under
torture
as
the
butler
puffed
and
stared
at
him
perhaps
not
so
much
as
that
not
so
much
sir
i
tell
you
that
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
is
a
bagatelle
well
i
know
it
a
big
sum
said
crowder
deprecatingly
here
there
was
a
general
laugh
all
the
other
intellects
present
were
more
cultivated
than
crowder
bagatelle
is
the
french
for
trifle
my
friend
said
christian
do
talk
over
people
heads
so
scales
i
shall
have
hard
work
to
understand
you
myself
soon
come
that
a
good
one
said
the
who
was
a
ready
admirer
i
should
like
to
hear
the
thing
you
do
understand
christian
he
a
hand
at
sneering
said
scales
rather
nettled
do
be
waspie
man
i
ring
the
bell
for
lemons
and
make
some
punch
that
the
thing
for
putting
people
up
to
the
unknown
tongues
said
christian
starting
up
and
slapping
scales
shoulder
as
he
passed
him
what
i
mean
crowder
is
this
here
scales
paused
to
puff
and
pull
down
his
waistcoat
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
and
drink
he
was
wont
in
this
way
to
give
his
hearers
time
for
meditation
come
then
speak
english
i
not
against
being
taught
said
the
reasonable
crowder
what
i
mean
is
that
in
a
large
way
of
trade
a
man
turns
his
capital
over
almost
as
soon
as
he
can
turn
himself
bless
your
soul
i
know
something
about
these
matters
eh
brent
to
be
sure
you
do
few
men
more
said
the
gardener
who
was
the
person
appealed
to
not
that
i
had
anything
to
do
with
commercial
families
myself
those
feelings
that
i
look
to
other
things
besides
lucre
but
i
say
that
i
not
been
intimate
with
parties
who
have
been
less
nice
than
i
am
myself
and
knowing
what
i
know
i
should
wonder
if
transome
had
as
much
as
five
hundred
thousand
bless
your
soul
sir
people
who
get
their
money
out
of
land
are
as
long
scraping
five
pounds
together
as
your
trading
men
are
in
turning
five
pounds
into
a
hundred
that
a
wicked
thing
though
said
crowder
meditatively
however
he
went
on
retreating
from
this
difficult
ground
trade
or
no
trade
the
transomes
have
been
poor
enough
this
many
a
long
year
i
a
brother
a
tenant
on
their
estate
i
ought
to
know
a
little
bit
about
that
they
kept
up
no
establishment
at
all
said
scales
with
disgust
they
even
let
their
kitchen
gardens
i
suppose
it
was
the
son
gambling
i
seen
something
of
that
a
man
who
has
always
lived
in
families
is
likely
to
know
a
thing
or
two
on
that
subject
ah
but
it
was
gambling
did
the
first
mischief
said
crowder
with
a
slight
smile
feeling
that
it
was
his
turn
to
have
some
superiority
do
know
what
happened
in
this
country
twenty
and
thirty
years
ago
i
turned
fifty
myself
and
my
father
lived
under
sir
maximus
father
but
if
anybody
from
london
can
tell
me
more
than
i
know
about
this
i
willing
to
listen
what
was
it
then
if
it
was
gambling
said
scales
with
some
impatience
do
pretend
to
know
it
was
law
law
that
what
it
was
not
but
what
the
transomes
always
won
and
always
lost
said
the
scales
yes
yes
i
think
we
all
know
the
nature
of
law
there
was
the
last
suit
of
all
made
the
most
noise
as
i
understood
continued
crowder
but
it
was
tried
hereabout
they
said
there
was
a
deal
o
false
swearing
some
young
man
pretended
to
be
the
true
heir
let
me
see
i
ca
justly
remember
the
names
he
got
two
swore
he
was
one
man
and
swore
he
was
another
however
lawyer
jermyn
won
it
they
say
he
win
a
game
against
the
old
one
himself
and
the
young
fellow
turned
out
to
be
a
scamp
stop
a
bit
his
name
was
scaddon
henry
scaddon
christian
here
let
a
lemon
slip
from
his
hand
into
the
with
a
splash
which
sent
some
of
the
nectar
into
the
company
faces
hallo
what
a
bungler
i
am
he
said
looking
as
if
he
were
quite
jarred
by
this
unusual
awkwardness
of
his
go
on
with
your
tale
crowder
a
scamp
named
henry
scaddon
well
that
the
tale
said
crowder
he
was
never
seen
nothing
of
anymore
it
was
a
deal
talked
of
at
the
time
and
i
sat
by
and
my
father
used
to
shake
his
head
and
always
when
this
transome
was
talked
of
he
used
to
shake
his
head
and
say
she
carried
things
with
a
high
hand
once
but
lord
it
was
before
the
battle
of
waterloo
and
a
poor
hand
at
tales
i
do
see
much
good
in
myself
but
if
anybody
tell
me
a
cure
for
the
i
thank
him
here
crowder
relapsed
into
smoking
and
silence
a
little
discomfited
that
the
knowledge
of
which
he
had
been
delivered
had
turned
out
rather
a
shapeless
and
insignificant
birth
well
well
bygones
should
be
bygones
there
are
secrets
in
most
good
families
said
scales
winking
and
this
young
transome
coming
back
with
a
fortune
to
keep
up
the
establishment
and
have
things
done
in
a
decent
and
gentlemanly
way
it
would
all
have
been
right
if
not
been
this
sort
of
radical
madman
but
now
he
done
for
himself
i
heard
sir
maximus
say
at
dinner
that
he
would
be
excommunicated
and
that
a
pretty
strong
word
i
take
it
what
does
it
mean
scales
said
christian
who
loved
tormenting
ay
what
the
meaning
insisted
crowder
encouraged
by
finding
that
even
christian
was
in
the
dark
well
it
a
law
term
speaking
in
a
figurative
sort
of
way
meaning
that
a
radical
was
no
gentleman
perhaps
it
partly
accounted
for
by
his
getting
his
money
so
fast
and
in
foreign
countries
said
crowder
tentatively
it
reasonable
to
think
he
be
against
the
land
and
this
country
eh
sircome
sircome
was
an
eminent
miller
who
had
considerable
business
transactions
at
the
manor
and
appreciated
scales
merits
at
a
handsome
percentage
on
the
yearly
account
he
was
a
highly
honorable
tradesman
but
in
this
and
in
other
matters
submitted
to
the
institutions
of
his
country
for
great
houses
as
he
observed
must
have
great
butlers
he
replied
to
his
friend
crowder
sententiously
i
say
nothing
before
i
bring
words
to
market
i
should
like
to
see
a
bit
scarcer
there
the
land
and
there
trade
i
hold
with
both
i
swim
with
the
stream
sircome
that
a
radical
maxim
said
christian
who
knew
that
sircome
last
sentence
was
his
favorite
formula
i
advise
you
to
give
it
up
else
it
will
injure
the
quality
of
your
flour
a
radical
maxim
said
sircome
in
a
tone
of
angry
astonishment
i
should
like
to
hear
you
prove
that
it
as
old
as
my
grandfather
anyhow
i
prove
it
in
one
minute
said
the
glib
christian
reform
has
set
in
by
the
will
of
the
majority
that
the
rabble
you
know
and
the
respectability
and
good
sense
of
the
country
which
are
in
the
minority
are
afraid
of
reform
running
on
too
fast
so
the
stream
must
be
running
toward
reform
and
radicalism
and
if
you
swim
with
it
sircome
you
a
reformer
and
a
radical
and
your
flour
is
objectionable
and
not
full
weight
and
being
tried
by
scales
will
be
found
wanting
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
this
pun
upon
scales
was
highly
appreciated
by
every
one
except
the
miller
and
butler
the
latter
pulled
down
his
waistcoat
and
puffed
and
stared
in
rather
an
excited
manner
christian
wit
in
general
seemed
to
him
a
poor
kind
of
quibbling
what
a
fellow
you
are
for
fence
christian
said
the
gardener
hang
me
if
i
do
think
you
up
to
everything
that
a
compliment
you
might
pay
old
nick
if
you
come
to
that
said
sircome
who
was
in
the
painful
position
of
a
man
deprived
of
his
formula
yes
yes
said
scales
i
no
fool
myself
and
could
parry
a
thrust
if
i
liked
but
i
should
like
it
to
be
said
of
me
that
i
was
up
to
everything
i
keep
a
little
principle
if
you
please
to
be
sure
said
christian
ladling
out
the
punch
what
would
justice
be
without
scales
the
laughter
was
not
quite
so
as
before
such
excessive
cleverness
a
little
satanic
a
joke
a
joke
among
gentlemen
said
the
butler
getting
exasperated
i
think
there
has
been
quite
liberties
enough
taken
with
my
name
but
if
you
must
talk
about
names
i
heard
of
a
party
before
now
calling
himself
a
christian
and
being
anything
it
come
that
beyond
a
joke
said
the
surgeon
assistant
a
fast
man
whose
chief
scene
of
dissipation
was
the
manor
let
it
drop
scales
yes
i
dare
say
it
beyond
a
joke
i
not
a
harlequin
to
talk
nothing
but
jokes
i
leave
that
to
other
christians
who
are
up
to
everything
and
have
been
everywhere
to
the
hulks
for
what
i
know
and
more
than
that
they
come
from
nobody
knows
where
and
try
to
worm
themselves
into
gentlemen
confidence
to
the
prejudice
of
their
betters
there
was
a
stricter
sequence
in
scales
angry
eloquence
than
was
apparent
some
chief
links
being
confined
to
his
own
breast
as
is
often
the
case
in
energetic
discourse
the
company
were
in
a
state
of
expectation
there
was
something
behind
worth
knowing
and
something
before
them
worth
seeing
in
the
general
decay
of
other
fine
british
pugnacious
sports
a
quarrel
between
gentlemen
was
all
the
more
exciting
and
though
no
one
would
himself
have
liked
to
turn
on
scales
no
one
was
sorry
for
the
chance
of
seeing
him
put
down
but
the
amazing
christian
was
unmoved
he
had
taken
out
his
handkerchief
and
was
rubbing
his
lips
carefully
after
a
slight
pause
he
spoke
with
perfect
coolness
i
do
intend
to
quarrel
with
you
scales
such
talk
as
this
is
not
profitable
to
either
of

it
makes
you
purple
in

you
apoplectic

it
spoils
good

tell
a
few
fibs
about

it
will
heat

do
me
more

i
leave
you
to

i
shall
go
and
have
a
game
of
whist
with
the
ladies
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
questionable
christian
scales
was
in
a
state
of
frustration
that
prevented
speech
every
one
was
rather
embarrassed
that
an
uncommon
sort
o
fellow
said
crowder
in
an
undertone
to
his
next
neighbor
the
gardener
why
philip
picked
him
up
in
foreign
parts
did
he
he
was
a
courier
said
the
gardener
he
had
a
deal
of
experience
and
i
believe
by
what
i
can
make
out
for
he
been
pretty
free
with
me
sometimes
there
was
a
time
when
he
was
in
that
rank
of
life
that
he
fought
a
duel
ah
that
makes
him
such
a
cool
chap
said
crowder
he
what
i
call
an
overbearing
fellow
said
sircome
also
to
his
next
neighbor
filmore
the
surgeon
assistant
he
runs
you
down
with
a
sort
of
talk
that
neither
here
nor
there
got
a
deal
too
many

in
his
pocket
for
me
all
i
know
is
he
a
wonderful

at
cards
said
filmore
whose
whiskers
and
were
quite
above

i
wish
i
could
play
as
he
does
it
beautiful
to
see
him
he
can
make
a

look
pretty
blue
he
empty
his

for
him
in
no
time
that
none
to
his
credit
said
sircome
the
conversation
had
in
this
way
broken
up
into
and
the
hilarity
of
the
evening
might
be
considered
a
failure
still
the
punch
was
drunk
the
accounts
were
duly
swelled
and
notwithstanding
the
innovating
spirit
of
the
time

kept
up
in

hereditary
british

chapter

rumor
doth
double
like
the

and
echo
the
mind
of
a

as
a
country
which
was
once
open
to
squatters
who
have
bred
and
multiplied
and
become
masters
of
the
land
but
then
happeneth
a
time
when
new
and
hungry
comers
dispute
the
land
and
there
is
trial
of
strength
and
the
stronger
wins
nevertheless
the
first
squatters
be
they
who
have
prepared
the
ground
and
the
crops
to
the
end
will
be
sequent
though
chiefly
on
the
nature
of
the
soil
as
of
light
sand
mixed

or
heavy
clay
yet
somewhat
on
the
primal
labor

that
talkative

above

through

trumpet
is
in
fact
a
very
old
maid
who
puckers
her
silly
face
by
the
fireside
and
really
does
no
more
than
chirp
a
wrong
guess
or
a
lame
story
into
the
ear
of
a
fellow

all
the
rest
of

done
by
the
ordinary
working
of
those

pray
in

litany
with
the
help
of
a
plentiful

against

we
have
never

had
any
authorized

strong

to

an
impressive
figure
in

together
with
his
very
slight
need
of
any
other
premise
than
his
own
sense
of
his
wide
general
knowledge

probable
infallibility
led

of
harold
transome
fortune
it
was
not
fair
to
put
this
down
to
poor
old
miss
rumor
who
had
only
told
scales
that
the
fortune
was
considerable
and
again
when
the
curt
sircome
found
occasion
at
treby
to
mention
the
five
hundred
thousand
as
a
fact
that
folks
seemed
pretty
sure
about
this
expansion
of
the
butler
into
folks
was
entirely
due
to
sircome
habitual
preference
for
words
which
could
not
be
laid
hold
of
or
give
people
a
handle
over
him
it
was
in
this
simple
way
that
the
report
of
harold
transome
fortune
spread
and
was
magnified
adding
much
lustre
to
his
opinion
in
the
eyes
of
liberals
and
compelling
even
men
of
the
opposite
party
to
admit
that
it
increased
his
eligibility
as
a
member
for
north
loamshire
it
was
observed
by
a
sound
thinker
in
these
parts
that
property
was
ballast
and
when
once
the
aptness
of
that
metaphor
had
been
perceived
it
followed
that
a
man
was
not
fit
to
navigate
the
sea
of
politics
without
a
great
deal
of
such
ballast
and
that
rightly
understood
whatever
increased
the
expense
of
election
inasmuch
as
it
virtually
raised
the
property
qualification
was
an
unspeakable
boon
to
the
country
meanwhile
the
fortune
that
was
getting
larger
in
the
imagination
of
constituents
was
shrinking
a
little
in
the
imagination
of
its
owner
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
there
were
not
only
the
heavy
mortgages
to
be
paid
off
but
also
a
large
amount
of
capital
was
needed
in
order
to
repair
the
all
over
the
estate
to
carry
out
extensive
drainage
and
make
allowances
to
tenants
which
might
remove
the
difficulties
of
newly
letting
the
farms
in
a
time
of
agricultural
depression
the
farms
actually
tenanted
were
held
by
men
who
had
begged
hard
to
succeed
their
fathers
in
getting
a
little
poorer
every
year
on
land
which
was
also
getting
poorer
where
the
highest
rate
of
increase
was
in
the
arrears
of
rent
and
where
the
master
in
crushed
hat
and
corduroys
looked
pitiably
lean
and
by
the
side
of
pauper
laborers
who
showed
that
superior
assimilating
power
often
observed
to
attend
nourishment
by
the
public
money
goffe
of
rabbit
end
had
never
had
it
explained
to
him
that
according
to
the
true
theory
of
rent
land
must
inevitably
be
given
up
when
it
would
not
yield
a
profit
equal
to
the
ordinary
rate
of
interest
so
that
from
want
of
knowing
what
was
inevitable
and
not
from
a
titanic
spirit
of
opposition
he
kept
on
his
land
he
often
said
to
himself
with
a
melancholy
wipe
of
his
sleeve
across
his
brow
that
he
did
know
to
turn
and
he
would
have
been
still
more
at
a
loss
on
the
subject
if
he
had
quitted
rabbit
end
with
a
wagonful
of
furniture
and
utensils
a
file
of
receipts
a
wife
with
five
children
and
a
shepherd
dog
in
low
spirits
it
took
no
long
time
for
harold
transome
to
discover
this
state
of
things
and
to
see
moreover
that
except
on
the
demesne
immediately
around
the
house
the
timber
had
been
mismanaged
the
woods
had
been
recklessly
thinned
and
there
had
been
insufficient
planting
he
had
not
yet
thoroughly
investigated
the
various
accounts
kept
by
his
mother
by
jermyn
and
by
banks
the
bailiff
but
what
had
been
done
with
the
large
sums
which
had
been
received
for
timber
was
a
suspicious
mystery
to
him
he
observed
that
the
farm
held
by
jermyn
was
in
order
that
a
good
deal
had
been
spent
on
the
buildings
and
that
the
rent
had
stood
unpaid
transome
had
taken
an
opportunity
of
saying
that
jermyn
had
had
some
of
the
mortgage
deeds
transferred
to
him
and
that
his
rent
was
set
against
so
much
interest
harold
had
only
said
in
his
careless
yet
decisive
way
oh
jermyn
be
hanged
it
seems
to
me
if
durfey
died
and
made
room
for
me
jermyn
would
have
ended
by
coming
to
live
here
and
you
would
have
had
to
keep
the
lodge
and
open
the
gate
for
his
carriage
but
i
shall
pay
him
off
mortgages
and
all
owe
him
nothing
not
even
a
curse
transome
said
no
more
harold
did
not
care
to
enter
fully
into
the
subject
with
his
mother
the
fact
that
she
had
been
active
in
the
management
of
the
estate
had
ridden
about
it
continually
had
busied
herself
with
accounts
had
been
of
the
vacant
farms
and
had
yet
allowed
things
to
go
wrong
was
set
down
by
him
simply
to
the
general
futility
of
attempts
to
transact
men
business
he
did
not
want
to
say
anything
to
annoy
her
he
was
only
determined
to
let
her
understand
as
quietly
as
possible
that
she
had
better
cease
all
interference
transome
did
understand
this
and
it
was
very
little
that
she
dared
to
say
on
business
though
there
was
a
fierce
struggle
of
her
anger
and
pride
with
a
dread
which
was
nevertheless
supreme
as
to
the
old
tenants
she
only
observed
on
hearing
harold
burst
forth
about
their
wretched
condition
that
with
the
estate
so
burdened
the
yearly
loss
by
arrears
could
better
be
borne
than
the
outlay
and
sacrifice
necessary
in
order
to
let
the
farms
anew
i
was
really
capable
of
calculating
harold
she
ended
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
it
seems
easy
to
deal
with
farmers
and
their
affairs
when
you
only
see
them
in
print
i
dare
say
but
it
not
quite
so
easy
when
you
live
among
them
you
have
only
to
look
at
sir
maximus
estate
you
will
see
plenty
of
the
same
thing
the
times
have
been
dreadful
and
old
families
like
to
keep
their
old
tenants
but
i
dare
say
that
is
toryism
it
a
hash
of
odds
and
ends
if
that
is
toryism
my
dear
mother
however
i
wish
you
had
kept
three
more
old
tenants
for
then
i
should
have
had
three
more
voters
and
in
a
hard
run
one
may
be
beaten
by
a
head
but
harold
added
smiling
and
handing
her
a
ball
of
worsted
which
had
fallen
a
woman
ought
to
be
a
tory
and
graceful
and
handsome
like
you
i
should
hate
a
woman
who
took
up
my
opinions
and
talked
for
me
i
an
oriental
you
know
i
say
mother
shall
we
have
this
room
furnished
with
i
notice
that
it
suits
your
bright
gray
hair
harold
thought
it
was
only
natural
that
his
mother
should
have
been
in
a
sort
of
subjection
to
jermyn
throughout
the
awkward
circumstances
of
the
family
it
was
the
way
of
women
and
all
weak
minds
to
think
that
what
they
had
been
used
to
was
unalterable
and
any
quarrel
with
a
man
who
managed
private
affairs
was
necessarily
a
formidable
thing
he
himself
was
proceeding
very
cautiously
and
preferred
not
even
to
know
too
much
just
at
present
lest
a
certain
personal
antipathy
he
was
conscious
of
toward
jermyn
and
an
occasional
liability
to
exasperation
should
get
the
better
of
a
calm
and
resolve
not
to
quarrel
with
the
man
while
he
could
be
of
use
harold
would
have
been
disgusted
with
himself
if
he
had
helped
to
frustrate
his
own
purpose
and
his
strongest
purpose
now
was
to
get
returned
for
parliament
to
make
a
figure
there
as
a
liberal
member
and
to
become
on
all
grounds
a
personage
of
weight
in
north
loamshire
how
howard
transome
came
to
be
a
liberal
in
opposition
to
all
the
traditions
of
his
family
was
a
more
subtle
enquiry
than
he
had
ever
cared
to
follow
out
the
newspapers
undertook
to
explain
it
the
loamshire
witnessed
with
a
grief
and
disgust
certain
to
be
shared
by
all
persons
who
were
actuated
by
wholesome
british
feeling
an
example
of
defection
in
the
inheritor
of
a
family
name
which
in
times
past
had
been
associated
with
attachment
to
right
principle
and
with
the
maintenance
of
our
constitution
in
church
and
state
and
pointed
to
it
as
an
additional
proof
that
men
who
had
passed
any
large
portion
of
their
lives
beyond
the
limits
of
our
favored
country
usually
contracted
not
only
a
laxity
of
feeling
toward
protestantism
nay
toward
religion
itself
a
latitudinarian
spirit
hardly
distinguishable
from
atheism
but
also
a
levity
of
disposition
inducing
them
to
tamper
with
those
institutions
by
which
alone
great
britain
had
risen
to
her
among
the
nations
such
men
infected
with
outlandish
habits
intoxicated
with
vanity
grasping
at
momentary
power
by
flattery
of
the
multitude
fearless
because
godless
liberal
because
were
ready
to
pull
one
stone
from
under
another
in
the
national
edifice
till
the
great
structure
tottered
to
its
fall
on
the
other
hand
the
saw
in
this
signal
instance
of
from
the
trammels
of
prejudice
a
decisive
guarantee
of
intellectual
united
with
a
generous
sensibility
to
the
claims
of
man
as
man
which
had
burst
asunder
and
cast
off
by
a
spontaneous
exertion
of
energy
the
cramping
shell
of
hereditary
bias
and
class
interest
but
these
guides
of
public
opinion
argued
from
wider
data
than
could
be
furnished
by
any
knowledge
of
the
particular
case
concerned
harold
transome
was
neither
the
dissolute
cosmopolitan
so
vigorously
sketched
by
the
tory
nor
the
intellectual
giant
and
moral
lobster
suggested
by
the
liberal
imagination
of
the
twenty
years
ago
he
had
been
a
bright
active
lad
with
sharp
eyes
and
a
good
aim
he
delighted
in
success
and
in
predominance
but
he
did
not
long
for
an
impossible
predominance
and
become
sour
and
sulky
because
it
was
impossible
he
played
at
the
games
he
was
clever
in
and
usually
won
all
other
games
he
let
alone
and
thought
them
of
little
worth
at
home
and
at
eton
he
had
been
side
by
side
with
his
stupid
elder
brother
durfey
whom
he
despised
and
he
very
early
began
to
reflect
that
since
this
caliban
in
miniature
was
older
than
himself
he
must
carve
out
his
own
fortune
that
was
a
nuisance
and
on
the
whole
the
world
seemed
rather
at
eton
especially
where
there
were
many
reasons
why
harold
made
no
great
figure
he
was
not
sorry
the
money
was
wanting
to
send
him
to
oxford
he
did
not
see
the
good
of
oxford
he
had
been
surrounded
by
many
things
during
his
short
life
of
which
he
had
distinctly
said
to
himself
that
he
did
not
see
the
good
and
he
was
not
disposed
to
venerate
on
the
strength
of
any
good
that
others
saw
he
turned
his
back
on
home
very
cheerfully
though
he
was
rather
fond
of
his
mother
and
very
fond
of
transome
court
and
the
river
where
he
had
been
used
to
fish
but
he
said
to
himself
as
he
passed
the
i
get
rich
somehow
and
have
an
estate
of
my
own
and
do
what
i
like
with
it
this
determined
aiming
at
something
not
easy
but
clearly
possible
marked
the
direction
in
which
nature
was
strong
he
had
the
energetic
will
and
muscle
the
the
quick
perception
and
the
narrow
imagination
which
make
what
is
admiringly
called
the
practical
mind
since
then
his
character
had
been
ripened
by
a
various
experience
and
also
by
much
knowledge
which
he
had
set
himself
deliberately
to
gain
but
the
man
was
no
more
than
the
boy
writ
large
with
an
extensive
commentary
the
years
had
nourished
an
inclination
to
as
much
opposition
as
would
enable
him
to
assert
his
own
independence
and
power
without
throwing
himself
into
that
tabooed
condition
which
robs
power
of
its
triumph
and
this
inclination
had
helped
his
shrewdness
in
forming
judgments
which
were
at
once
innovating
and
moderate
he
was
addicted
at
once
to
rebellion
and
to
conformity
and
only
an
intimate
personal
knowledge
could
enable
any
one
to
predict
where
his
conformity
would
begin
the
limit
was
not
defined
by
theory
but
was
drawn
in
an
irregular
zigzag
by
early
disposition
and
association
and
his
resolution
of
which
he
had
never
lost
hold
to
be
a
thorough
englishman
again
some
day
had
kept
up
the
habit
of
considering
all
his
conclusions
with
reference
to
english
politics
and
english
social
conditions
he
meant
to
stand
up
for
every
change
that
the
economical
condition
of
the
country
required
and
he
had
an
angry
contempt
for
men
with
coronets
on
their
coaches
but
too
small
a
share
of
brains
to
see
when
they
had
better
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
his
respect
was
rather
for
men
who
had
no
coronets
but
who
achieved
a
just
influence
by
furthering
all
measures
which
the
of
the
country
and
the
increasing
of
the
majority
peremptorily
demanded
he
could
be
such
a
man
himself
in
fact
harold
transome
was
a
clever
frank
egoist
not
stringently
consistent
but
without
any
disposition
to
falsity
but
with
a
pride
that
was
moulded
in
an
individual
rather
than
an
hereditary
form
unspeculative
unsentimental
unsympathetic
fond
of
sensual
pleasures
but
disinclined
to
all
vice
and
attached
as
a
healthy
person
to
all
conventional
morality
construed
with
a
certain
freedom
like
doctrinal
articles
to
which
the
public
order
may
require
subscription
a
character
is
apt
to
look
but
indifferently
written
out
in
this
way
reduced
to
a
map
our
premises
seem
insignificant
but
they
make
nevertheless
a
very
pretty
freehold
to
live
in
and
walk
over
and
so
if
harold
transome
had
been
among
your
acquaintances
and
you
had
observed
his
qualities
through
the
medium
of
his
agreeable
person
bright
smile
and
a
certain
easy
charm
which
accompanies
sensuousness
when
unsullied
by
coarseness
through
the
medium
also
of
the
many
opportunities
in
which
he
would
have
made
himself
useful
or
pleasant
to
you
you
would
have
thought
him
a
good
fellow
highly
acceptable
as
a
guest
a
colleague
or
a
whether
all
mothers
would
have
liked
him
as
a
son
is
another
question
it
is
a
fact
perhaps
kept
a
little
too
much
in
the
background
that
mothers
have
a
self
larger
than
their
maternity
and
that
when
their
sons
have
become
taller
than
themselves
and
are
gone
from
them
to
college
or
into
the
world
there
are
wide
spaces
of
their
time
which
are
not
filled
with
praying
for
their
boys
reading
old
letters
and
envying
yet
blessing
those
who
are
attending
to
their
transome
was
certainly
not
one
of
those
bland
adoring
and
gently
tearful
women
after
sharing
the
common
dream
that
when
a
beautiful
was
born
to
her
her
cup
of
happiness
would
be
full
she
had
travelled
through
long
years
apart
from
that
child
to
find
herself
at
last
in
the
presence
of
a
son
of
whom
she
was
afraid
who
was
utterly
unmanageable
by
her
and
to
whose
sentiments
in
any
given
case
she
possessed
no
key
yet
harold
was
a
kind
son
he
kissed
his
brow
offered
her
his
arm
let
her
choose
what
she
liked
for
the
house
and
garden
asked
her
whether
she
would
have
bays
or
grays
for
her
new
carriage
and
was
bent
on
seeing
her
make
as
good
a
figure
in
the
neighborhood
as
any
other
woman
of
her
rank
she
trembled
under
this
kindness
it
was
not
enough
to
satisfy
her
still
if
it
should
ever
cease
and
give
place
to
something
else
she
was
too
uncertain
about
harold
feelings
to
imagine
clearly
what
that
something
would
be
the
finest
threads
such
as
no
eye
sees
if
bound
cunningly
about
the
sensitive
flesh
so
that
the
movement
to
break
them
would
bring
torture
may
make
a
worse
bondage
than
any
fetters
transome
felt
the
fatal
thread
about
her
and
the
bitterness
of
this
helpless
bondage
mingled
itself
with
the
new
elegancies
of
the
dining
and
and
all
the
household
changes
which
harold
had
ordered
to
be
brought
about
with
magical
quickness
nothing
was
as
she
had
once
expected
it
would
be
if
harold
had
shown
the
least
care
to
have
her
stay
in
the
room
with
him
if
he
had
really
cared
for
her
opinion
if
he
had
been
what
she
had
dreamed
he
would
be
in
the
eyes
of
those
people
who
had
made
her
world
if
all
the
past
could
be
dissolved
and
leave
no
solid
trace
of
itself
mighty
that
were
all
impossible
she
would
have
tasted
some
joy
but
now
she
began
to
look
back
with
regret
to
the
days
when
she
sat
in
loneliness
among
the
old
drapery
and
still
longed
for
something
that
might
happen
yet
save
in
a
bitter
little
speech
or
in
a
deep
sigh
heard
by
no
one
besides
denner
she
kept
all
these
things
hidden
in
her
heart
and
went
out
in
the
autumn
sunshine
to
overlook
the
alterations
in
the
very
much
as
a
happy
woman
might
have
done
one
day
however
when
she
was
occupied
in
this
way
an
occasion
came
on
which
she
chose
to
express
indirectly
a
part
of
her
inward
care
she
was
standing
on
the
broad
gravel
in
the
afternoon
the
long
shadows
lay
on
the
grass
the
light
seemed
the
more
glorious
because
of
the
reddened
and
golden
trees
the
gardeners
were
busy
at
their
pleasant
work
the
soil
gave
out
an
agreeable
fragrance
and
little
harry
was
playing
with
nimrod
round
old
transome
who
sat
placidly
on
a
low
the
scene
would
have
made
a
charming
picture
of
english
domestic
life
and
the
handsome
majestic
woman
obviously
grandmamma
would
have
been
especially
admired
but
the
artist
would
have
felt
it
requisite
to
turn
her
face
toward
her
husband
and
little
grandson
and
to
have
given
her
an
elderly
amiability
of
expression
which
would
have
divided
remark
with
his
exquisite
rendering
of
her
indian
shawl
transome
face
was
turned
the
other
way
and
for
this
reason
she
only
heard
an
approaching
step
and
did
not
see
whose
it
was
yet
it
startled
her
it
was
not
quick
enough
to
be
her
son
step
and
besides
harold
was
away
at
duffield
it
was
jermyn
chapter
ix
a
woman
naturally
born
to
fears
methinks
some
unborn
sorrow
ripe
in
fortune
womb
is
coming
toward
me
and
my
inward
soul
with
nothing
trembles
richard
matthew
jermyn
approached
transome
taking
off
his
hat
and
smiling
she
did
not
smile
but
said
you
knew
harold
was
not
at
home
yes
i
came
to
see
you
to
know
if
you
had
any
wishes
that
i
could
further
since
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
of
consulting
you
since
he
came
home
let
us
walk
toward
the
rookery
then
they
turned
together
jermyn
still
keeping
his
hat
off
and
holding
it
behind
him
the
air
was
so
soft
and
agreeable
that
transome
had
nothing
but
a
large
veil
over
her
head
they
walked
for
a
little
while
in
silence
till
they
were
out
of
sight
under
tall
trees
and
treading
noiselessly
on
falling
leaves
what
jermyn
was
really
most
anxious
about
was
to
learn
from
transome
whether
anything
had
transpired
that
was
significant
of
disposition
toward
him
which
he
suspected
to
be
very
far
from
friendly
jermyn
was
not
naturally
at
he
had
written
verses
and
had
got
himself
wet
through
in
order
not
to
disappoint
a
woman
whom
he
was
proud
to
believe
in
love
with
him
but
a
family
man
with
grown
up
sons
and
daughters
a
man
with
a
professional
position
and
complicated
affairs
that
make
it
hard
to
ascertain
the
exact
relation
between
property
and
liabilities
necessarily
thinks
of
himself
and
what
may
be
impending
harold
is
remarkably
acute
and
clever
he
began
at
last
since
transome
did
not
speak
if
he
gets
into
parliament
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
distinguish
himself
he
has
a
quick
eye
for
business
of
all
kinds
that
is
no
comfort
to
me
said
transome
she
was
more
conscious
than
usual
of
that
bitterness
which
was
always
in
her
mind
in
jermyn
presence
but
which
was
carefully
suppressed
suppressed
because
she
could
not
endure
that
the
degradation
she
inwardly
felt
should
ever
become
visible
or
audible
in
acts
or
words
of
her
own
should
ever
be
reflected
in
any
word
or
look
of
his
for
years
there
had
been
a
deep
silence
about
the
past
between
them
on
her
side
because
she
remembered
on
his
because
he
more
and
more
forgot
i
trust
he
is
not
unkind
to
you
in
any
way
i
know
his
opinions
pain
you
but
i
trust
you
find
him
in
everything
else
disposed
to
be
a
good
son
oh
to
be
sure
good
as
men
are
disposed
to
be
to
women
giving
them
cushions
and
carriages
and
recommending
them
to
enjoy
themselves
and
then
expecting
them
to
be
contented
under
contempt
and
neglect
i
have
no
power
over
him
remember
that
none
jermyn
turned
to
look
in
transome
face
it
was
long
since
he
had
heard
her
speak
to
him
as
if
she
were
losing
her
has
he
shown
any
unpleasant
feeling
about
your
management
of
affairs
management
transome
said
with
concentrated
rage
flashing
a
fierce
look
at
jermyn
she
checked
herself
she
felt
as
if
she
were
lighting
a
torch
to
flare
on
her
own
past
folly
and
misery
it
was
a
resolve
which
had
become
a
habit
that
she
would
never
quarrel
with
this
man
never
tell
him
what
she
saw
him
to
be
she
had
kept
her
pride
and
sensibility
intact
through
all
her
life
there
had
vibrated
the
maiden
need
to
have
her
hand
kissed
and
be
the
object
of
chivalry
and
so
she
sank
into
silence
again
trembling
jermyn
felt
annoyed
nothing
more
there
was
nothing
in
his
mind
corresponding
to
the
intricate
meshes
of
sensitiveness
in
transome
he
was
anything
but
stupid
yet
he
always
blundered
when
he
wanted
to
be
delicate
or
magnanimous
he
constantly
sought
to
soothe
others
by
praising
himself
moral
vulgarity
cleaved
to
him
like
an
hereditary
odor
he
blundered
now
my
dear
transome
he
said
in
a
tone
of
bland
kindness
you
are
agitated
you
appear
angry
with
me
yet
i
think
if
you
consider
you
will
see
that
you
have
nothing
to
complain
of
in
me
unless
you
will
complain
of
the
inevitable
course
of
man
life
i
have
always
met
your
wishes
both
in
happy
circumstances
and
in
unhappy
ones
i
should
be
ready
to
do
so
now
if
it
were
possible
every
sentence
was
as
pleasant
to
her
as
if
it
had
been
cut
in
her
bared
arm
some
men
kindness
and
are
more
exasperating
more
humiliating
than
others
derision
but
the
pitiable
woman
who
has
once
made
herself
secretly
dependent
on
a
man
who
is
beneath
her
in
feeling
must
bear
that
humiliation
for
fear
of
worse
coarse
kindness
is
at
least
better
than
coarse
anger
and
in
all
private
quarrels
the
duller
nature
is
triumphant
by
reason
of
its
dullness
transome
knew
in
her
inmost
soul
that
those
relations
which
had
sealed
her
lips
on
jermyn
conduct
in
business
matters
had
been
with
him
a
ground
for
presuming
that
he
should
have
impunity
in
any
lax
dealing
into
which
circumstances
had
led
him
she
knew
that
she
herself
had
endured
all
the
more
privation
because
of
his
dishonest
selfishness
and
now
heirship
and
his
return
with
startlingly
unexpected
penetration
activity
and
assertion
of
mastery
had
placed
them
both
in
the
full
presence
of
a
difficulty
which
had
been
prepared
by
the
years
of
vague
uncertainty
as
to
issues
in
this
position
with
a
great
dread
hanging
over
her
which
jermyn
knew
and
ought
to
have
felt
that
he
had
caused
her
she
was
inclined
to
lash
him
with
indignation
to
scorch
him
with
the
words
that
were
just
the
fit
names
for
his
doings
inclined
all
the
more
when
he
spoke
with
an
insolent
blandness
ignoring
all
that
was
truly
in
her
heart
but
no
sooner
did
the
words
you
have
brought
it
on
me
rise
within
her
than
she
heard
within
also
the
retort
you
brought
it
on
yourself
not
for
all
the
world
beside
could
she
bear
to
hear
that
retort
uttered
from
without
what
did
she
do
with
strange
sequence
to
all
that
rapid
tumult
after
a
few
moments
silence
she
said
let
me
take
your
arm
he
gave
it
immediately
putting
on
his
hat
and
wondering
for
more
than
twenty
years
transome
had
never
chosen
to
take
his
arm
i
have
but
one
thing
to
ask
make
me
a
promise
what
is
it
that
you
will
never
quarrel
with
harold
you
must
know
that
it
is
my
wish
not
to
quarrel
with
him
but
make
a
vow
fix
it
in
your
mind
as
a
thing
not
to
be
done
bear
anything
from
him
rather
than
quarrel
with
him
a
man
ca
make
a
vow
not
to
quarrel
said
jermyn
who
was
already
a
little
irritated
by
the
implication
that
harold
might
be
disposed
to
use
him
roughly
a
man
temper
may
get
the
better
of
him
at
any
moment
i
am
not
prepared
to
bear
good
god
said
transome
taking
her
hand
from
his
arm
is
it
possible
you
do
feel
how
horrible
it
would
be
as
she
took
away
her
hand
jermyn
let
his
arm
fall
put
both
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
said
i
shall
use
him
as
he
uses
me
jermyn
had
turned
round
his
savage
side
and
the
blandness
was
out
of
sight
it
was
this
that
had
always
frightened
transome
there
was
a
possibility
of
fierce
insolence
in
this
man
who
was
to
pass
with
those
nearest
to
her
as
her
indebted
servant
but
whose
brand
she
secretly
bore
she
was
as
powerless
with
him
as
she
was
with
her
own
son
this
woman
who
loved
rule
dared
not
speak
another
word
of
attempted
persuasion
they
were
both
silent
taking
the
nearest
way
into
the
sunshine
again
there
was
a
wish
in
both
their
minds
even
in
the
mother
that
harold
transome
had
never
been
born
we
are
working
hard
for
the
election
said
jermyn
recovering
himself
as
they
turned
into
the
sunshine
again
i
think
we
shall
get
him
returned
and
in
that
case
he
will
be
in
high
everything
will
be
more
propitious
than
you
are
apt
to
think
you
must
persuade
yourself
he
added
smiling
at
her
that
it
is
better
for
a
man
of
his
position
to
be
in
parliament
on
the
wrong
side
than
not
to
be
in
at
all
never
said
transome
i
am
too
old
to
learn
to
call
bitter
sweet
and
sweet
bitter
but
what
i
may
think
or
feel
is
of
no
consequence
now
i
am
as
unnecessary
as
a
chimney
ornament
and
in
this
way
they
parted
on
the
gravel
in
that
pretty
scene
where
they
had
met
transome
shivered
as
she
stood
alone
all
around
her
where
there
had
once
been
brightness
and
warmth
there
were
white
ashes
and
the
sunshine
looked
dreary
as
it
fell
on
them
jermyn
heaviest
reflections
in
riding
homeward
turned
on
the
possibility
of
incidents
between
himself
and
harold
transome
which
would
have
disagreeable
results
requiring
him
to
raise
money
and
perhaps
causing
scandal
which
in
its
way
might
also
help
to
create
a
monetary
deficit
a
man
of
sixty
with
a
wife
whose
duffield
connections
were
of
the
highest
respectability
with
a
family
of
tall
daughters
an
expensive
establishment
and
a
large
professional
business
owed
a
great
deal
more
to
himself
as
the
mainstay
of
all
those
solidities
than
to
feelings
and
ideas
which
were
quite
unsubstantial
there
were
many
unfortunate
coincidences
which
placed
jermyn
in
an
uncomfortable
position
just
now
he
had
not
been
much
to
blame
he
considered
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
sudden
turn
of
affairs
no
one
would
have
complained
he
defied
any
man
to
say
that
he
had
intended
to
wrong
people
he
was
able
to
refund
to
make
reprisals
if
they
could
be
fairly
demanded
only
he
would
certainly
have
preferred
that
they
should
not
be
demanded
a
german
poet
was
entrusted
with
a
particularly
fine
sausage
which
he
was
to
convey
to
the
donor
friend
at
paris
in
the
course
of
a
long
journey
he
smelled
the
sausage
he
got
hungry
and
desired
to
taste
it
he
pared
a
morsel
off
then
another
and
another
in
successive
moments
of
temptation
till
at
last
the
sausage
was
humanly
speaking
at
an
end
the
offence
had
not
been
premeditated
the
poet
had
never
loved
meanness
but
he
loved
sausage
and
the
result
was
undeniably
awkward
so
it
was
with
matthew
jermyn
he
was
far
from
liking
that
ugly
abstraction
rascality
but
he
had
liked
other
things
which
had
suggested
nibbling
he
had
to
do
many
things
in
law
and
in
daily
life
which
in
the
abstract
he
would
have
condemned
and
indeed
he
had
never
been
tempted
by
them
in
the
abstract
here
in
fact
was
the
inconvenience
he
had
sinned
for
the
sake
of
particular
concrete
things
and
particular
concrete
consequences
were
likely
to
follow
but
he
was
a
man
of
resolution
who
having
made
out
what
was
the
best
course
to
take
under
a
difficulty
went
straight
to
his
work
the
election
must
be
won
that
would
put
harold
in
give
him
something
to
do
and
leave
himself
more
time
to
prepare
for
any
crisis
he
was
in
anything
but
low
spirits
that
evening
it
was
his
eldest
daughter
birthday
and
the
young
people
had
a
dance
papa
was
delightful
stood
up
for
a
quadrille
and
a
told
stories
at
supper
and
made
humorous
quotations
from
his
early
readings
if
these
were
latin
he
apologized
and
translated
to
the
ladies
so
that
a
deaf
from
duffield
kept
her
trumpet
up
continually
lest
she
should
lose
any
of
jermyn
conversation
and
wished
that
her
niece
maria
had
been
present
who
was
young
and
had
a
good
memory
still
the
party
was
smaller
than
usual
for
some
families
in
treby
refused
to
visit
jermyn
now
that
he
was
concerned
for
a
radical
candidate
chapter
x
he
made
love
neither
with
roses
nor
with
apples
nor
with
locks
of
theocritus
one
sunday
afternoon
felix
holt
rapped
at
the
door
of
lyon
house
although
he
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
minister
preaching
in
the
chapel
he
stood
with
a
book
under
his
arm
apparently
confident
that
there
was
someone
in
the
house
to
open
the
door
for
him
in
fact
esther
never
went
to
chapel
in
the
afternoon
that
exercise
made
her
head
ache
in
these
september
weeks
felix
had
got
rather
intimate
with
lyon
they
shared
the
same
political
sympathies
and
though
to
liberals
who
had
neither
freehold
nor
copyhold
nor
leasehold
the
share
in
a
county
election
consisted
chiefly
of
that
prescriptive
amusement
of
the
majority
known
as
looking
on
there
was
still
something
to
be
said
on
the
occasion
if
not
to
be
done
perhaps
the
most
delightful
friendships
are
those
in
which
there
is
much
agreement
much
disputation
and
yet
more
personal
liking
and
the
advent
of
the
contradictory
yet
affectionate
felix
into
treby
life
had
made
a
welcome
epoch
to
the
minister
to
talk
with
this
young
man
who
though
hopeful
had
a
singularity
which
some
might
at
once
have
pronounced
heresy
but
which
lyon
persisted
in
regarding
as
orthodoxy
in
the
making
was
like
a
good
bite
to
strong
teeth
after
a
too
plentiful
allowance
of
spoon
meat
to
cultivate
his
society
with
a
view
to
checking
his
erratic
tendencies
was
a
laudable
purpose
but
perhaps
if
felix
had
been
rapidly
subdued
and
reduced
to
conformity
little
lyon
would
have
found
the
conversation
much
flatter
esther
had
not
seen
so
much
of
their
new
acquaintance
as
her
father
had
but
she
had
begun
to
find
him
amusing
and
also
rather
irritating
to
her
woman
love
of
conquest
he
always
opposed
and
criticised
her
and
besides
that
he
looked
at
her
as
if
he
never
saw
a
single
detail
about
her
person
quite
as
if
she
were
a
woman
in
a
cap
she
did
not
believe
that
he
had
ever
admired
her
hands
or
her
long
neck
or
her
graceful
movements
which
had
made
all
the
girls
at
school
call
her
calypso
doubtless
from
their
familiarity
with
telémaque
felix
ought
properly
to
have
been
a
little
in
love
with
her
never
mentioning
it
of
course
because
that
would
have
been
disagreeable
and
his
being
a
regular
lover
was
out
of
the
question
but
it
was
quite
clear
that
instead
of
feeling
any
disadvantage
on
his
own
side
he
held
himself
to
be
immeasurably
her
superior
and
what
was
worse
esther
had
a
secret
consciousness
that
he
was
her
superior
she
was
all
the
more
vexed
at
the
suspicion
that
he
thought
slightly
of
her
and
wished
in
her
vexation
that
she
could
have
found
more
fault
with
him
that
she
had
not
been
obliged
to
admire
more
and
more
the
varying
expressions
of
his
open
face
and
his
deliciously
laugh
always
loud
at
a
joke
against
himself
besides
she
could
not
help
having
her
curiosity
roused
by
the
unusual
combinations
both
in
his
mind
and
in
his
outward
position
and
she
had
surprised
herself
as
well
as
her
father
one
day
by
suddenly
starting
up
and
proposing
to
walk
with
him
when
he
was
going
to
pay
an
afternoon
visit
to
holt
to
try
and
soothe
her
concerning
felix
what
a
mother
he
has
she
said
to
herself
when
they
came
away
again
but
rude
and
queer
as
he
is
i
can
not
say
there
is
anything
vulgar
about
him
yet
i
do
know
if
i
saw
him
by
the
side
of
a
finished
gentleman
esther
wished
that
finished
gentleman
were
among
her
acquaintances
he
would
certainly
admire
her
and
make
her
aware
of
felix
inferiority
on
this
particular
sunday
afternoon
when
she
heard
the
knock
at
the
door
she
was
seated
in
the
kitchen
corner
between
the
fire
and
the
window
reading
réné
certainly
in
her
dress
she
almost
always
wore
some
shade
of
blue
with
her
delicate
sandaled
slipper
stretched
toward
the
fire
her
little
gold
watch
which
had
cost
her
nearly
a
quarter
earnings
visible
at
her
side
her
slender
fingers
playing
with
a
shower
of
brown
curls
and
a
coronet
of
shining
plaits
at
the
summit
of
her
head
she
was
a
remarkable
cinderella
when
the
rap
came
she
colored
and
was
going
to
shut
her
book
and
put
it
out
of
the
way
on
the
window
ledge
behind
her
but
she
desisted
with
a
little
toss
laid
it
open
on
the
table
beside
her
and
walked
to
the
outer
door
which
opened
into
the
kitchen
there
was
rather
a
mischievous
gleam
in
her
face
the
rap
was
not
a
small
one
it
came
probably
from
a
large
personage
with
a
vigorous
arm
good
afternoon
miss
lyon
said
felix
taking
off
his
cloth
cap
he
resolutely
declined
the
expensive
ugliness
of
a
hat
and
in
a
poked
cap
and
without
a
cravat
made
a
figure
at
which
his
mother
cried
every
sunday
and
thought
of
with
a
slow
shake
of
the
head
at
several
passages
in
the
minister
prayer
dear
me
it
is
you
holt
i
fear
you
will
have
to
wait
some
time
before
you
can
see
my
father
the
sermon
is
not
ended
yet
and
there
will
be
the
hymn
and
the
prayer
and
perhaps
other
things
to
detain
him
well
will
you
let
me
sit
down
in
the
kitchen
i
do
want
to
be
a
bore
oh
no
said
esther
with
her
pretty
light
laugh
i
always
give
you
credit
for
not
meaning
it
pray
come
in
if
you
do
mind
waiting
i
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
the
kettle
is
singing
quite
prettily
it
is
much
nicer
than
the
parlor
not
half
so
ugly
there
i
agree
with
you
how
very
extraordinary
but
if
you
prefer
the
kitchen
and
do
want
to
sit
with
me
i
can
go
into
the
parlor
i
came
on
purpose
to
sit
with
you
said
felix
in
his
blunt
way
but
i
thought
it
likely
you
might
be
vexed
at
seeing
me
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
but
i
got
nothing
pleasant
to
say
as
your
father
would
have
it
i
not
given
to
prophesy
smooth
things
to
prophesy
deceit
i
understand
said
esther
sitting
down
pray
be
seated
you
thought
i
had
no
afternoon
sermon
so
you
came
to
give
me
one
yes
said
felix
seating
himself
sideways
in
a
chair
not
far
off
her
and
leaning
over
the
back
to
look
at
her
with
his
large
clear
gray
eyes
and
my
text
is
something
you
said
the
other
day
you
said
you
did
mind
about
people
having
right
opinions
so
that
they
had
good
taste
now
i
want
you
to
see
what
shallow
stuff
that
is
oh
i
do
doubt
it
if
you
say
so
i
know
you
are
a
person
of
right
opinions
but
by
opinions
you
mean
men
thoughts
about
great
subjects
and
by
taste
you
mean
their
thoughts
about
small
ones
dress
behavior
amusements
ornaments
well
yes
or
rather
their
sensibilities
about
those
things
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
thoughts
opinions
knowledge
are
only
a
sensibility
to
facts
and
ideas
if
i
understand
a
geometrical
problem
it
is
because
i
have
a
sensibility
to
the
way
in
which
lines
and
figures
are
related
to
each
other
and
i
want
you
to
see
that
the
creature
who
has
the
sensibilities
that
you
call
taste
and
not
the
sensibilities
that
you
call
opinions
is
simply
a
lower
pettier
sort
of
thing
an
insect
that
notices
the
shaking
of
the
table
but
never
notices
the
thunder
very
well
i
am
an
insect
yet
i
notice
that
you
are
thundering
at
me
no
you
are
not
an
insect
that
is
what
exasperates
me
at
your
making
a
boast
of
littleness
you
have
enough
understanding
to
make
it
wicked
that
you
should
add
one
more
to
the
women
who
hinder
men
lives
from
having
any
nobleness
in
them
esther
colored
deeply
she
resented
this
speech
yet
she
disliked
it
less
than
many
felix
had
addressed
to
her
what
is
my
horrible
guilt
she
said
rising
and
standing
as
she
was
wont
with
one
foot
on
the
fender
and
looking
at
the
fire
if
it
had
been
any
one
but
felix
who
was
near
her
it
might
have
occurred
to
her
that
this
attitude
showed
her
to
advantage
but
she
had
only
a
mortified
sense
that
he
was
quite
indifferent
to
what
others
praised
her
for
why
do
you
read
this
mawkish
stuff
on
a
sunday
for
example
he
said
snatching
up
réné
and
running
his
eye
over
the
pages
why
do
you
always
go
to
chapel
holt
and
read
howe
temple
and
join
the
church
there
just
the
difference
between
us
i
know
why
i
do
do
those
things
i
distinctly
see
that
i
can
do
something
better
i
have
other
principles
and
should
sink
myself
by
doing
what
i
do
recognize
as
the
best
i
understand
said
esther
as
lightly
as
she
could
to
conceal
her
bitterness
i
am
a
lower
kind
of
being
and
could
not
so
easily
sink
myself
not
by
entering
into
your
father
ideas
if
a
woman
really
believes
herself
to
be
a
lower
kind
of
being
she
should
place
herself
in
subjection
she
should
be
ruled
by
the
thoughts
of
her
father
or
husband
if
not
let
her
show
her
power
of
choosing
something
better
you
must
know
that
your
father
principles
are
greater
and
worthier
than
what
guides
your
life
you
have
no
reason
but
idle
fancy
and
selfish
inclination
for
shirking
his
teaching
and
giving
your
soul
up
to
trifles
you
are
kind
enough
to
say
so
but
i
am
not
aware
that
i
have
ever
confided
my
reasons
to
you
why
what
worth
calling
a
reason
could
make
any
mortal
hang
over
this
trash
idiotic
immorality
dressed
up
to
look
fine
with
a
little
bit
of
doctrine
tacked
to
it
like
a
hare
foot
on
a
dish
to
make
believe
the
mess
is
not
cat
flesh
look
here
ma
faute
si
je
trouve
partout
les

si
ce
qui

fini
pour

yes
sir
distinctly
your
fault
because
you
an
ass
your
dunce
who
do
his
sums
always
has
a
taste
for
the
infinite
sir
do
you
know
what
a
rhomboid
is
oh
no
i
do
value
these
things
with

la
monotonie
des

de
la
vie
et
si
encore
la
folie
de
croire
au

oh
pray
holt
do
go
on
reading
with
that
dreadful
accent
it
sets
one
teeth
on
edge
esther
smarting
helplessly
under
the
previous
lashes
was
relieved
by
this
diversion
of
criticism
there
it
is
said
felix
throwing
the
book
on
the
table
and
getting
up
to
walk
about
you
are
only
happy
when
you
can
spy
a
tag
or
a
tassel
loose
to
turn
the
talk
and
get
rid
of
any
judgment
that
must
carry
grave
action
after
it
i
think
i
have
borne
a
great
deal
of
talk
without
turning
it
not
enough
miss
lyon
not
all
that
i
came
to
say
i
want
you
to
change
of
course
i
am
a
brute
to
say
so
i
ought
to
say
you
are
perfect
another
man
would
perhaps
but
i
say
i
want
you
to
change
how
am
i
to
oblige
you
by
joining
the
church
no
but
by
asking
yourself
whether
life
is
not
as
solemn
a
thing
as
your
father
takes
it
to
be
in
which
you
may
be
either
a
blessing
or
a
curse
to
many
you
know
you
have
never
done
that
you
do
care
to
be
better
than
a
bird
trimming
its
feathers
and
pecking
about
after
what
pleases
it
you
are
discontented
with
the
world
because
you
ca
get
just
the
small
things
that
suit
your
pleasure
not
because
it
a
world
where
myriads
of
men
and
women
are
ground
by
wrong
and
misery
and
tainted
with
pollution
esther
felt
her
heart
swelling
with
mingled
indignation
at
this
liberty
wounded
pride
at
this
depreciation
and
acute
consciousness
that
she
could
not
contradict
what
felix
said
he
was
outrageously
but
she
felt
that
she
should
be
lowering
herself
by
telling
him
so
and
manifesting
her
anger
in
that
way
she
would
be
confirming
his
accusation
of
a
littleness
that
shrank
from
severe
truth
and
besides
through
all
her
mortification
there
pierced
a
sense
that
this
exasperation
of
felix
against
her
was
more
complimentary
than
anything
in
his
previous
behavior
she
had
enough
to
speak
with
her
usual
silvery
voice
pray
go
on
holt
relieve
yourself
of
these
burning
truths
i
am
sure
they
must
be
troublesome
to
carry
unuttered
yes
they
are
said
felix
pausing
and
standing
not
far
off
her
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
going
the
way
of
the
foolish
women
who
spoil
lives
men
ca
help
loving
them
and
so
they
make
themselves
slaves
to
the
petty
desires
of
petty
creatures
that
the
way
those
who
might
do
better
spend
their
lives
for
nought
get
checked
in
every
great
effort
toil
with
brain
and
limb
for
things
that
have
no
more
to
do
with
a
manly
life
than
tarts
and
confectionery
that
what
makes
women
a
curse
and
life
is
stunted
to
suit
their
littleness
that
why
never
love
if
i
can
help
it
and
if
i
love
i
bear
it
and
never
marry
the
tumult
of
feeling
in
esther
mind
mortification
anger
the
sense
of
a
terrible
power
over
her
that
felix
seemed
to
have
as
his
angry
words
vibrated
through
her
was
getting
almost
too
much
for
her
she
felt
her
lips
quivering
but
her
pride
which
feared
nothing
so
much
as
the
betrayal
of
her
emotion
helped
her
to
a
desperate
effort
she
pinched
her
own
hand
hard
to
overcome
her
tremor
and
said
in
a
tone
of
scorn
i
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
giving
me
your
confidence
so
freely
ah
now
you
are
offended
with
me
and
disgusted
with
me
i
expected
it
would
be
so
a
woman
does
like
a
man
who
tells
her
the
truth
i
think
you
boast
a
little
too
much
of
your
holt
said
esther
flashing
out
at
last
that
virtue
is
apt
to
be
easy
to
people
when
they
only
wound
others
and
not
themselves
telling
the
truth
often
means
no
more
than
taking
a
liberty
yes
i
suppose
i
should
have
been
taking
a
liberty
if
i
had
tried
to
drag
you
back
by
the
skirt
when
i
saw
you
running
into
a
pit
you
should
really
found
a
sect
preaching
is
your
vocation
it
is
a
pity
you
should
ever
have
an
audience
of
only
one
i
see
i
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
i
thought
you
had
a
more
generous
mind
that
you
might
be
kindled
to
a
better
ambition
but
i
set
your
vanity
aflame
nothing
else
i
going
said
esther
not
looking
at
him
he
did
not
open
the
door
immediately
he
seemed
to
be
adjusting
his
cap
and
pulling
it
down
esther
longed
to
be
able
to
throw
a
lasso
round
him
and
compel
him
to
stay
that
she
might
say
what
she
chose
to
him
her
very
anger
made
this
departure
irritating
especially
as
he
had
the
last
word
and
that
a
very
bitter
one
but
soon
the
latch
was
lifted
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
she
ran
up
to
her
bedroom
and
burst
into
tears
poor
maiden
there
was
a
strange
contradiction
of
impulses
in
her
mind
in
those
first
moments
she
could
not
bear
that
felix
should
not
respect
her
yet
she
could
not
bear
that
he
should
see
her
bend
before
his
denunciation
she
revolted
against
his
assumption
of
superiority
yet
she
felt
herself
in
a
new
kind
of
subjection
to
him
he
was
he
was
rude
he
had
taken
an
unwarrantable
liberty
yet
his
indignant
words
were
a
tribute
to
her
he
thought
she
was
worth
more
pains
than
the
women
of
whom
he
took
no
notice
it
was
excessively
impertinent
in
him
to
tell
her
of
his
resolving
not
to
love
not
to
marry
as
if
she
cared
about
that
as
if
he
thought
himself
likely
to
inspire
an
affection
that
would
incline
any
woman
to
marry
him
after
such
eccentric
steps
as
he
had
taken
had
he
ever
for
a
moment
imagined
that
she
had
thought
of
him
in
the
light
of
a
man
who
would
make
love
to
her
but
did
he
love
her
one
little
bit
and
was
that
the
reason
why
he
wanted
her
to
change
esther
felt
less
angry
at
that
form
of
freedom
though
she
was
quite
sure
that
she
did
not
love
him
and
that
she
could
never
love
any
one
who
was
so
much
of
a
pedagogue
and
master
to
say
nothing
of
his
oddities
but
he
wanted
her
to
change
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
esther
felt
herself
seriously
shaken
in
her
she
knew
there
was
a
mind
to
which
she
appeared
trivial
narrow
selfish
every
word
felix
had
said
to
her
seemed
to
have
burned
itself
into
her
memory
she
felt
as
if
she
should
forevermore
be
haunted
by
and
never
do
anything
to
satisfy
those
fancies
on
which
she
had
simply
piqued
herself
before
without
being
dogged
by
inward
questions
her
father
desire
for
her
conversion
had
never
moved
her
she
saw
that
he
adored
her
all
the
while
and
he
never
checked
her
unregenerate
acts
as
if
they
degraded
her
on
earth
but
only
mourned
over
them
as
unfitting
her
for
heaven
unfitness
for
heaven
spoken
of
as
jerusalem
and
glory
the
prayers
of
a
good
little
father
whose
thoughts
and
motives
seemed
to
her
like
the
life
of
doddridge
which
she
was
content
to
leave
unread
did
not
attack
her
and
but
now
she
had
been
stung
stung
even
into
a
new
consciousness
concerning
her
father
was
it
true
that
his
life
was
so
much
worthier
than
her
own
she
could
not
change
for
anything
felix
said
but
she
told
herself
he
was
mistaken
if
he
supposed
her
incapable
of
generous
thoughts
she
heard
her
father
coming
into
the
house
she
dried
her
tears
tried
to
recover
herself
hurriedly
and
went
down
to
him
you
want
your
tea
father
how
your
forehead
burns
she
said
gently
kissing
his
brow
and
then
putting
her
cool
hand
on
it
lyon
felt
a
little
surprise
such
spontaneous
tenderness
was
not
quite
common
with
her
it
reminded
him
of
her
mother
my
sweet
child
he
said
gratefully
thinking
with
wonder
of
the
treasures
still
left
in
our
fallen
nature
chapter
xi
truth
is
the
precious
harvest
of
the
earth
but
once
when
harvest
waved
upon
a
land
the
noisome
cankerworm
and
caterpillar
locusts
and
all
the
swarming
broods
fastened
upon
it
with
swift
greedy
jaws
and
turned
the
harvest
into
pestilence
until
men
said
what
profits
it
to
sow
felix
was
going
to
sproxton
that
sunday
afternoon
he
always
enjoyed
his
walk
to
that
outlying
hamlet
it
took
him
by
a
short
cut
through
a
corner
of
sir
maximus
debarry
park
then
across
a
piece
of
common
broken
here
and
there
into
red
ridges
below
dark
masses
of
furze
and
for
the
rest
of
the
way
alongside
of
the
canal
where
the
sunday
peacefulness
that
seemed
to
rest
on
the
bordering
meadows
and
pastures
was
hardly
broken
if
a
horse
pulled
into
sight
along
the
and
a
boat
with
a
little
curl
of
blue
smoke
issuing
from
its
tin
chimney
came
slowly
gliding
behind
felix
retained
something
of
his
boyish
impression
that
the
days
in
a
were
all
like
sundays
but
the
horse
if
it
had
been
put
to
him
would
probably
have
preferred
a
more
judaic
or
scotch
rigor
with
regard
to
or
at
least
that
the
sunday
towing
should
be
done
by
asses
as
a
lower
order
this
canal
was
only
a
branch
of
the
grand
trunk
and
ended
among
the
where
felix
crossing
a
network
of
black
soon
came
to
his
destination
that
public
institute
of
sproxton
known
to
its
frequenters
chiefly
as
chubb
but
less
familiarly
as
the
sugar
loaf
or
the
new
pits
this
last
being
the
name
for
the
more
modern
and
lively
nucleus
of
the
sproxton
hamlet
the
other
nucleus
known
as
the
old
pits
also
supported
its
public
but
it
had
something
of
the
forlorn
air
of
an
abandoned
capital
and
the
company
at
the
blue
cow
was
of
an
inferior
kind
equal
of
course
in
the
fundamental
attributes
of
humanity
such
as
desire
for
beer
but
not
equal
in
ability
to
pay
for
it
when
felix
arrived
the
great
chubb
was
standing
at
the
door
chubb
was
a
remarkable
publican
none
of
your
stock
bonifaces
red
bloated
jolly
and
joking
he
was
thin
and
sallow
and
was
never
as
his
constant
guests
observed
seen
to
be
the
worse
or
the
better
for
liquor
indeed
as
among
soldiers
an
eminent
general
was
held
to
have
a
charmed
life
chubb
was
held
by
the
members
of
the
benefit
club
to
have
a
charmed
sobriety
a
vigilance
over
his
own
interest
that
resisted
all
narcotics
his
very
dreams
as
stated
by
himself
had
a
method
in
them
beyond
the
waking
thoughts
of
other
men
pharaoh
dream
he
observed
was
nothing
to
them
and
as
lying
so
much
out
of
ordinary
experience
they
were
held
particularly
suitable
for
narration
on
sunday
evenings
when
the
listening
colliers
well
washed
and
in
their
best
coats
shook
their
heads
with
a
sense
of
peculiar
edification
which
belongs
to
the
inexplicable
chubb
reasons
for
becoming
landlord
of
the
sugar
loaf
were
founded
on
the
severest
calculation
having
an
active
mind
and
being
averse
to
bodily
labor
he
had
thoroughly
considered
what
calling
would
yield
him
the
best
livelihood
with
the
least
possible
exertion
and
in
that
sort
of
line
he
had
seen
that
a
public
amongst
miners
who
earned
high
wages
was
a
fine
opening
he
had
prospered
according
to
the
merits
of
such
judicious
calculation
was
already
a
freeholder
and
was
conscious
of
a
vote
for
the
county
he
was
not
one
of
those
men
who
found
the
franchise
embarrassing
and
would
rather
have
been
without
it
he
regarded
his
vote
as
part
of
his
investment
and
meant
to
make
the
best
of
it
he
called
himself
a
man
and
at
suitable
moments
expressed
his
views
freely
in
fact
he
was
known
to
have
one
fundamental
division
for
all
opinion
my
idee
and
humbug
when
felix
approached
chubb
was
standing
as
usual
with
his
hands
nervously
busy
in
his
pockets
his
eyes
glancing
around
with
a
detective
expression
at
the
black
landscape
and
his
lipless
mouth
compressed
yet
in
constant
movement
on
a
superficial
view
it
might
be
supposed
that
so
a
personality
was
unsuited
to
the
publican
business
but
in
fact
it
was
a
great
provocative
to
drinking
like
the
shrill
biting
talk
of
a
vixenish
wife
it
would
have
compelled
you
to
take
a
little
something
by
way
of
dulling
your
sensibility
hitherto
notwithstanding
felix
drank
so
little
ale
the
publican
treated
him
with
high
civility
the
coming
election
was
a
great
opportunity
for
applying
his
political
idee
which
was
that
society
existed
for
the
sake
of
the
individual
and
that
the
name
of
that
individual
was
chubb
now
for
a
conjunction
of
absurd
circumstances
inconsistent
with
that
idea
it
happened
that
sproxton
hereto
had
been
somewhat
neglected
in
the
canvass
the
head
member
of
the
company
that
worked
the
mines
was
peter
garstin
and
the
same
company
received
the
rent
from
the
sugar
loaf
hence
as
the
person
who
had
the
most
power
of
annoying
chubb
and
being
of
detriment
to
him
garstin
was
naturally
the
candidate
for
whom
he
had
reserved
his
vote
but
where
there
is
this
intention
of
ultimately
gratifying
a
gentleman
by
voting
for
him
in
an
open
british
manner
on
the
day
of
the
poll
a
man
whether
publican
or
pharisee
chubb
used
this
generic
classification
of
mankind
as
one
that
was
sanctioned
by
scripture
is
all
the
freer
in
his
relation
with
those
deluded
persons
who
take
him
for
what
he
is
not
and
imagine
him
to
be
a
waverer
but
for
some
time
opportunity
had
seemed
barren
there
were
but
three
dubious
votes
besides
in
the
small
district
of
which
the
sugar
loaf
could
be
regarded
as
the
centre
of
intelligence
and
inspiration
the
colliers
of
course
had
no
votes
and
did
not
need
political
conversion
consequently
the
interests
of
sproxton
had
only
been
tacitly
cherished
in
the
breasts
of
candidates
but
ever
since
it
had
been
known
that
a
radical
candidate
was
in
the
field
that
in
consequence
of
this
debarry
had
coalesced
with
garstin
and
that
sir
james
clement
the
poor
baronet
had
retired
chubb
had
been
occupied
with
the
most
ingenious
mental
combinations
in
order
to
ascertain
what
possibilities
of
profit
to
the
sugar
loaf
might
lie
in
this
altered
state
of
the
canvass
he
had
a
cousin
in
another
county
also
a
publican
but
in
a
larger
way
and
resident
in
a
borough
and
from
him
chubb
had
gathered
more
detailed
political
information
than
he
could
find
in
the
loamshire
newspapers
he
was
now
enlightened
enough
to
know
that
there
was
a
way
of
using
voteless
miners
and
navvies
at
nominations
and
elections
he
approved
of
that
it
entered
into
his
political
idee
and
indeed
he
would
have
been
for
extending
the
franchise
to
this
class
at
least
in
sproxton
if
any
one
had
observed
that
you
must
draw
a
line
somewhere
chubb
would
have
concurred
at
once
and
would
have
given
permission
to
draw
it
at
a
radius
of
two
miles
from
his
own
tap
from
the
first
sunday
evening
when
felix
had
appeared
at
the
sugar
loaf
chubb
had
made
up
his
mind
that
this
man
who
kept
himself
sober
was
an
electioneering
agent
that
he
was
hired
for
some
purpose
or
other
there
was
not
a
doubt
a
man
did
come
and
drink
nothing
without
a
good
reason
in
proportion
as
felix
purpose
was
not
obvious
to
chubb
mind
it
must
be
deep
and
this
growing
conviction
had
even
led
the
publican
on
the
last
sunday
evening
privately
to
urge
his
mysterious
visitor
to
let
a
little
ale
be
chalked
up
for
him
it
was
of
no
consequence
felix
knew
his
man
and
had
taken
care
not
to
betray
too
soon
that
his
real
object
was
so
to
win
the
ear
of
the
best
fellows
about
him
as
to
induce
them
to
meet
him
on
a
saturday
evening
in
the
room
where
lyon
or
one
of
his
deacons
habitually
held
his
wednesday
preachings
only
women
and
children
three
old
men
a
journeyman
tailor
and
a
consumptive
youth
attended
those
preachings
not
a
collier
had
been
won
from
the
strong
ale
of
the
sugar
loaf
not
even
a
navvy
from
the
muddier
drink
of
the
blue
cow
felix
was
sanguine
he
saw
some
pleasant
faces
among
the
miners
when
they
were
washed
on
sundays
they
might
be
taught
to
spend
their
wages
better
at
all
events
he
was
going
to
try
he
had
great
confidence
in
his
powers
of
appeal
and
it
was
quite
true
that
he
never
spoke
without
arresting
attention
there
was
nothing
better
than
a
dame
school
in
the
hamlet
he
thought
that
if
he
could
move
the
fathers
whose
blackened
persons
and
flannel
caps
ornamented
with
tallow
candles
by
way
of
plume
were
a
badge
of
hard
labor
for
which
he
had
a
more
sympathetic
fibre
than
for
any
ribbon
in
the
buttonhole
if
he
could
move
these
men
to
save
something
from
their
drink
and
pay
a
for
their
boys
a
greater
service
would
be
done
them
than
if
garstin
and
his
company
were
persuaded
to
establish
a
school
i
lay
hold
of
them
by
their
fatherhood
said
felix
i
take
one
of
their
little
fellows
and
set
him
in
the
midst
till
they
can
show
there
something
they
love
better
than
swilling
themselves
with
ale
extension
of
the
suffrage
can
never
mean
anything
for
them
but
extension
of
boozing
one
must
begin
somewhere
i
begin
at
what
is
under
my
nose
i
begin
at
sproxton
that
what
a
man
would
do
if
he
had
a
superstition
ca
one
work
for
sober
truth
as
hard
as
for
megrims
felix
holt
had
his
illusions
like
other
young
men
though
they
were
not
of
a
fashionable
sort
referring
neither
to
the
impression
his
costume
and
horsemanship
might
make
on
beholders
nor
to
the
ease
with
which
he
would
pay
the
jews
when
he
gave
a
loose
to
his
talents
and
applied
himself
to
work
he
had
fixed
his
choice
on
a
certain
mike
brindle
not
that
brindle
was
his
real
name
each
collier
had
his
as
the
man
whom
he
would
induce
to
walk
part
of
the
way
home
with
him
this
very
evening
and
get
to
invite
some
of
his
comrades
for
the
next
saturday
brindle
was
one
of
the
head
miners
he
had
a
bright
face
and
had
given
especial
attention
to
certain
performances
with
a
magnet
which
felix
carried
in
his
pocket
chubb
who
had
also
his
illusions
smiled
graciously
as
the
enigmatic
customer
came
up
to
the
well
sir
sunday
seems
to
be
your
day
i
begin
to
look
for
you
on
a
sunday
now
yes
i
a
workingman
sunday
is
my
holiday
said
felix
pausing
at
the
door
since
the
host
seemed
to
expect
this
ah
sir
there
many
ways
of
working
i
look
at
it
you
one
of
those
as
work
with
your
brains
that
what
i
do
myself
one
may
do
a
good
deal
of
that
and
work
with
one
hands
too
ah
sir
said
chubb
with
a
certain
bitterness
in
his
smile
that
sort
of
head
that
i
often
wished
i
was
stupider
i
use
things
up
sir
i
see
into
things
a
deal
too
quick
i
eat
my
dinner
as
you
may
say
at
that
why
i
hardly
ever
smoke
a
pipe
no
sooner
do
i
stick
a
pipe
in
my
mouth
than
i
puff
and
puff
till
it
gone
before
other
folks
are
well
lit
and
then
where
am
i
i
might
as
well
have
let
it
alone
in
this
world
it
better
not
to
be
too
quick
but
you
know
what
it
is
sir
not
i
said
felix
rubbing
the
back
of
his
head
with
a
grimace
i
generally
feel
myself
rather
a
blockhead
the
world
a
largish
place
and
i
have
turned
everything
inside
out
yet
ah
that
your
deepness
i
think
we
understand
one
another
and
about
this
here
election
i
lay
two
to
one
we
should
agree
if
we
was
to
come
to
talk
about
it
ah
said
felix
with
an
air
of
caution
you
none
of
a
tory
eh
sir
you
wo
go
to
vote
for
debarry
that
was
what
i
said
at
the
very
first
says
i
he
no
tory
i
think
i
was
right
sir
eh
certainly
i
no
tory
no
no
you
do
catch
me
wrong
in
a
hurry
well
between
you
and
me
i
care
no
more
for
the
debarrys
than
i
care
for
johnny
groats
i
live
on
none
o
their
land
and
not
a
did
they
ever
send
to
the
sugar
loaf
i
not
frightened
at
the
debarrys
there
no
man
more
independent
than
me
i
plump
or
i
split
for
them
as
treat
me
the
handsomest
and
are
the
most
of
what
i
call
gentlemen
that
my
idee
and
in
the
way
of
hatching
for
any
man
them
are
fools
that
do
employ
me
we
mortals
sometimes
cut
a
pitiable
figure
in
our
attempts
at
display
we
may
be
sure
of
our
own
merits
yet
fatally
ignorant
of
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
are
regarded
by
our
neighbor
our
fine
patterns
in
tattooing
may
be
far
from
throwing
him
into
a
swoon
of
admiration
though
we
turn
ourselves
all
round
to
show
them
thus
it
was
with
chubb
yes
said
felix
dryly
i
should
think
there
are
some
sorts
of
work
for
which
you
are
just
fitted
ah
you
see
that
well
we
understand
one
another
you
no
tory
no
more
am
i
and
if
i
got
four
hands
to
show
at
a
nomination
the
debarrys
should
have
one
of
my
idee
is
there
a
deal
too
much
of
their
scutchins
and
their
moniments
in
treby
church
what
their
scutchins
mean
they
a
sign
with
little
liquor
behind
that
how
i
take
it
there
nobody
can
give
account
of
as
i
ever
heard
chubb
was
hindered
from
further
explaining
his
views
as
to
the
historical
element
in
society
by
the
arrival
of
new
guests
who
approached
in
two
groups
the
foremost
group
consisted
of
colliers
in
their
good
sunday
beavers
and
colored
handkerchiefs
serving
as
cravats
with
the
long
ends
floating
the
second
group
was
a
more
unusual
one
and
caused
chubb
to
compress
his
mouth
and
agitate
the
muscles
about
it
in
rather
an
excited
manner
first
came
a
personage
on
horseback
with
a
conspicuous
expansive
and
figured
satin
stock
he
was
a
stout
man
and
gave
a
strong
sense
of
broadcloth
a
wild
idea
shot
through
brain
could
this
grand
visitor
be
harold
transome
excuse
him
he
had
been
given
to
understand
by
his
cousin
from
the
distant
borough
that
a
radical
candidate
in
the
condescension
of
canvassing
had
even
gone
the
length
of
eating
with
the
children
of
an
honest
freeman
and
declaring
his
preference
for
that
simple
fare
notion
of
a
radical
was
that
he
was
a
new
and
agreeable
kind
of
who
fawned
on
the
poor
instead
of
on
the
rich
and
so
was
likely
to
send
customers
to
a
public
so
that
he
argued
well
enough
from
the
premises
at
his
command
the
mounted
man
of
broadcloth
had
followers
several
men
and
sproxton
boys
of
all
sizes
whose
curiosity
had
been
stimulated
by
unexpected
largesse
a
stranger
on
horseback
scattering
on
a
sunday
was
so
unprecedented
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
he
might
do
next
and
the
smallest
hindmost
fellows
in
sealskin
caps
were
not
without
hope
that
an
entirely
new
order
of
things
had
set
in
everyone
waited
outside
for
the
stranger
to
dismount
and
chubb
advanced
to
take
the
bridle
well
chubb
were
the
first
words
when
the
great
man
was
safely
out
of
the
saddle
i
often
heard
of
your
fine
tap
and
i
come
to
taste
it
walk
in
sir
pray
walk
in
said
chubb
giving
the
horse
to
the
i
shall
be
proud
to
draw
for
you
if
anybody
been
praising
me
i
think
my
ale
will
back
him
all
entered
in
the
rear
of
the
stranger
except
the
boys
who
peeped
in
at
the
window
wo
you
please
to
walk
into
the
parlor
sir
said
chubb
obsequiously
no
no
i
sit
down
here
this
is
what
i
like
to
see
said
the
stranger
looking
round
at
the
colliers
who
eyed
him
rather
shyly
a
bright
hearth
where
workingmen
can
enjoy
themselves
however
i
step
into
the
other
room
for
three
minutes
just
to
speak
half
a
dozen
words
with
you
chubb
threw
open
the
parlor
door
and
then
stepping
back
took
the
opportunity
of
saying
in
a
low
tone
to
felix
do
you
know
this
gentleman
not
i
no
chubb
opinion
of
felix
holt
sank
from
that
moment
the
parlor
door
was
closed
but
no
one
sat
down
or
ordered
beer
i
say
master
said
mike
brindle
going
up
to
felix

think
that
one
o
the
men
very
likely
i
heared
a
chap
say

brindle
and
now
the
time
they
say
when
a
man

get
beer
for
nothing
ay
that
sin
the
reform

a
big
man
called
dredge
that
brought

and
the
drink

these
parts
for
afore

it
was
all

a
but

brindle
with
some
contempt
well
i
do
folks

o
their
own
pickaxes
you
drive
nothing
into
not
if
you
split
their
skulls
i
know
for
certain
sure
from
a
chap
in
the
cartin
way
as
he
got
money
and
drink
too
only
for
hollering
eh
master
what
do
say
brindle
ended
turning
with
some
deference
to
felix
should
you
like
to
know
all
about
the
reform
said
felix
using
his
opportunity
if
you
would
i
can
tell
you
ay
ay
tell
you

be
bound
said
several
voices
at
once

little
time
and
we
must
be
quiet
the
cleverest
of
you

the
club

black

i
make

brindle
with
some
disgust

poor
crawling
thing

no
more
i
did
beat

and
square
at
me
a
good
un
if
i
set
him
on
there
you
go
blatherin
said
brindle
intending
a
mild
rebuke
this
dialogue
which
was
in
danger
of
becoming
too
personal
was
interrupted
by
the
reopening
of
the
parlor
door
and
the
reappearance
of
the
impressive
stranger
with
chubb
whose
countenance
seemed
unusually
radiant
sit
you
down
here
johnson
said
chubb
moving
an
this
gentleman
is
kind
enough
to
treat
the
company
he
added
looking
round
and
what
more
he
take
a
cup
with
and
i
think
there
no
man
but
what
say
that
a
honor
the
company
had
nothing
equivalent
to
a
hear
hear
at
command
but
they
perhaps
felt
the
more
as
they
seated
themselves
with
an
expectation
unvented
by
utterance
there
was
a
general
satisfactory
sense
that
the
hitherto
shadowy
reform
had
at
length
come
to
sproxton
in
a
good
round
shape
with
broadcloth
and
pockets
felix
did
not
intend
to
accept
the
treating
but
he
chose
to
stay
and
hear
taking
his
pint
as
usual
capital
ale
capital
ale
said
johnson
as
he
set
down
his
glass
speaking
in
a
quick
smooth
treble
now
he
went
on
with
a
certain
pathos
in
his
voice
looking
at
chubb
who
sat
opposite
some
satisfaction
to
me
in
finding
an
establishment
like
this
at
the
pits
for
what
would
higher
wages
do
for
the
workingman
if
he
get
a
good
article
for
his
money
why
gentlemen
here
he
looked
round
i
been
into
where
i
seen
a
fine
fellow
of
a
miner
or
a
come
in
and
have
to
lay
down
money
for
beer
that
i
should
be
sorry
to
give
to
my
pigs
here
johnson
leaned
forward
with
squared
elbows
hands
placed
on
his
knees
and
a
defiant
shake
of
the
head
aw
like
at
the
blue
cow
fell
in
the
irrepressible
dredge
in
a
deep
bass
but
he
was
rebuked
by
a
severe
nudge
from
brindle
yes
yes
you
know
what
it
is
my
friend
said
johnson
looking
at
dredge
and
restoring
his
but
it
wo
last
much
longer
that
one
good
thing
bad
liquor
will
be
swept
away
with
other
bad
articles
trade
will
prosper
and
what
trade
now
without
steam
and
what
is
steam
without
coal
and
mark
you
this
gentlemen
there
no
man
and
no
government
can
make
coal
a
loud
haw
haw
showed
that
this
fact
was
appreciated
nor
freeston
nayther
said
a
wiry
man
called
gills
who
wished
for
an
exhaustive
treatment
of
the
subject
being
a
nor
freestone
as
you
say
else
i
think
if
coal
could
be
made
honest
fellows
who
are
the
pith
of
our
population
would
not
have
to
bend
their
backs
and
sweat
in
a
pit
six
days
out
of
the
seven
no
no
i
say
as
this
country
prospers
it
has
more
and
more
need
of
you
sirs
it
can
do
without
a
pack
of
lazy
lords
and
ladies
but
it
can
never
do
without
brave
colliers
and
the
country
prosper
i
pledge
you
my
word
sirs
this
country
will
rise
to
the
tiptop
of
everything
and
there
is
a
man
in
it
but
what
shall
have
his
joint
in
the
pot
and
his
spare
money
jingling
in
his
pocket
if
we
only
exert
ourselves
to
send
the
right
men
to
parliament
men
who
will
speak
up
for
the
collier
and
the
and
the
navvy
johnson
waved
his
hand
liberally
and
will
stand
no
nonsense
this
is
a
crisis
and
we
must
exert
ourselves
we
got
reform
gentlemen
but
now
the
thing
is
to
make
reform
work
it
a
crisis
i
pledge
you
my
word
it
a
crisis
johnson
threw
himself
back
as
if
from
the
concussion
of
that
great
noun
he
did
not
suppose
that
one
of
his
audience
knew
what
a
crisis
meant
but
he
had
large
experience
in
the
effect
of
uncomprehended
words
and
in
this
case
the
colliers
were
thrown
into
a
state
of
conviction
concerning
they
did
not
know
what
which
was
a
fine
preparation
for
hitting
out
or
any
other
act
carrying
a
due
sequence
to
such
a
conviction
felix
felt
himself
in
danger
of
getting
into
a
rage
there
is
hardly
any
mental
misery
worse
than
that
of
having
our
own
serious
phrases
our
own
rooted
beliefs
caricatured
by
a
charlatan
or
a
hireling
he
began
to
feel
the
sharp
lower
edge
of
his
tin
and
to
think
it
a
tempting
missile
johnson
certainly
had
some
qualifications
as
an
orator
after
this
impressive
pause
he
leaned
forward
again
and
said
in
a
lowered
tone
looking
round
i
think
you
all
know
the
good
news
there
was
a
movement
of
on
the
quarried
floor
and
a
scrape
of
some
chair
legs
but
no
other
answer
the
good
news
i
mean
is
that
a
man
transome
of
transome
court
has
offered
himself
to
represent
you
in
parliament
sirs
i
say
you
in
particular
for
what
he
has
at
heart
is
the
welfare
of
the
workingman
of
the
brave
fellows
that
wield
the
pickaxe
and
the
saw
and
the
hammer
he
rich
has
more
money
than
garstin
but
he
does
want
to
keep
it
to
himself
what
he
wants
is
to
make
a
good
use
of
it
gentlemen
he
come
back
from
foreign
parts
with
his
pockets
full
of
gold
he
could
buy
up
the
debarrys
if
they
were
worth
buying
but
he
got
something
better
to
do
with
his
money
he
means
to
use
it
for
the
good
of
the
workingmen
in
these
parts
i
know
there
are
some
men
who
put
up
for
parliament
and
talk
a
little
too
big
they
may
say
they
want
to
befriend
the
colliers
for
example
but
i
should
like
to
put
a
question
to
them
i
should
like
to
ask
them
colliers
there
are
colliers
up
at
newcastle
and
there
are
colliers
down
in
wales
will
it
do
any
good
to
honest
tom
who
is
hungry
in
sproxton
to
hear
that
jack
at
newcastle
has
his
belly
full
of
beef
and
pudding
it
ought
to
do
him
good
felix
burst
in
with
his
loud
abrupt
voice
in
odd
contrast
with
glib
johnson
if
he
knows
it
a
bad
thing
to
be
hungry
and
not
have
enough
to
eat
he
ought
to
be
glad
that
another
fellow
who
is
not
idle
is
not
suffering
in
the
same
way
every
one
was
startled
the
audience
was
much
impressed
with
the
grandeur
the
knowledge
and
the
power
of
johnson
his
brilliant
promises
confirmed
the
impression
that
reform
had
at
length
reached
the
new
pits
and
reform
if
it
were
good
for
anything
must
at
last
resolve
itself
into
spare
money
meaning
sport
and
drink
and
keeping
away
from
work
for
several
days
in
the
week
these
brave
men
of
sproxton
liked
felix
as
one
of
themselves
only
much
more
knowing
as
a
workingman
who
had
seen
many
distant
parts
but
who
must
be
very
poor
since
he
never
drank
more
than
a
pint
or
so
they
were
quite
inclined
to
hear
what
he
had
got
to
say
on
another
occasion
but
they
were
rather
irritated
by
his
interruption
at
the
present
moment
johnson
was
annoyed
but
he
spoke
with
the
same
glib
quietness
as
before
though
with
an
expression
of
contempt
i
call
it
a
thing
to
take
up
a
man
words
and
twist
them
what
i
meant
to
say
was
plain
enough
that
no
man
can
be
saved
from
starving
by
looking
on
while
others
eat
i
think
that
eh
sirs
there
was
again
an
approving
haw
haw
to
hear
anything
said
and
understand
it
was
a
stimulus
that
had
the
effect
of
wit
chubb
cast
a
suspicious
and
viperous
glance
at
felix
who
felt
that
he
had
been
a
simpleton
for
his
pains
well
then
continued
johnson
i
suppose
i
may
go
on
but
if
there
is
any
one
here
better
able
to
inform
the
company
than
i
am
i
give
way
i
give
way
sir
said
chubb
magisterially
no
man
shall
take
the
words
out
of
mouth
in
this
house
and
he
added
looking
pointedly
at
felix
company
that
got
no
more
orders
to
give
and
wants
to
turn
up
rusty
to
them
that
has
had
better
be
making
room
than
filling
it
love
an
the
word
on
our
club
flag
an
love
an
the
meaning
of
sugar
loaf
william
chubb
folks
of
a
different
mind
had
better
seek
another
house
of
call
very
good
said
felix
laying
down
his
money
and
taking
his
cap
going
he
saw
clearly
enough
that
if
he
said
more
there
would
be
a
disturbance
which
could
have
no
desirable
end
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
johnson
said
what
is
that
person
name
does
anybody
know
it
said
chubb
a
few
noes
were
heard
i
heard
him
speak
like
a
downright
reformer
else
i
should
have
looked
a
little
sharper
after
him
but
you
may
see
he
nothing
it
looks
rather
bad
that
no
one
knows
his
name
said
johnson
he
most
likely
a
tory
in
disguise
a
tory
spy
you
must
be
careful
sirs
of
men
who
come
to
you
and
say
they
radicals
and
yet
do
nothing
for
you
they
stuff
you
with
words
no
lack
of
words
but
words
are
wind
now
a
man
like
transome
comes
forward
and
says
to
the
workingmen
of
this
country
i
am
ready
to
serve
you
and
speak
for
you
in
parliament
and
to
get
the
laws
made
all
right
for
you
and
in
the
meanwhile
if
there
any
of
you
who
are
my
neighbors
who
want
a
day
holiday
or
a
cup
to
drink
with
friends
or
a
copy
of
the
likeness
why
i
your
man
i
not
a
paper
handbill
all
words
and
no
substance
nor
a
man
with
land
and
nothing
else
i
got
bags
of
gold
as
well
as
land
i
think
you
know
what
i
mean
by
the
king
likeness
here
johnson
took
a
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
the
head
toward
the
company
well
sirs
there
are
some
men
who
like
to
keep
this
pretty
picture
a
great
deal
too
much
to
themselves
i
do
know
whether
i
right
but
i
think
i
heard
of
such
a
one
not
a
hundred
miles
from
here
i
think
his
name
was
spratt
and
he
managed
some
company
haw
haw
spratt
spratt
his
name
was
rolled
forth
to
an
accompaniment
of
scraping
a
screwing
fellow
by
what
i
understand
a
domineering
fellow
who
would
expect
men
to
do
as
he
liked
without
paying
them
for
it
i
think
there
not
an
honest
man
would
like
to
disappoint
such
an
upstart
there
was
a
murmur
which
was
interpreted
by
chubb
i
answer
for
sir
now
listen
to
me
here
garstin
he
one
of
the
company
you
work
under
what
garstin
to
you
who
sees
him
and
when
they
do
see
him
they
see
a
thin
miserly
fellow
who
keeps
his
pockets
buttoned
he
calls
himself
a
whig
yet
he
split
votes
with
a
tory
he
drive
with
the
debarrys
now
gentlemen
if
i
said
i
got
a
vote
and
anybody
asked
me
what
i
should
do
with
it
i
should
say
plump
for
transome
you
got
no
votes
and
that
a
shame
but
you
have
some
day
if
such
men
as
transome
are
returned
and
then
you
be
on
a
level
with
the
first
gentleman
in
the
land
and
if
he
wants
to
sit
in
parliament
he
must
take
off
his
hat
and
ask
your
leave
but
though
you
have
got
a
vote
you
can
give
a
cheer
for
the
right
man
and
transome
not
a
man
like
garstin
if
you
lost
a
day
wages
by
giving
a
cheer
for
transome
he
make
you
amends
that
the
way
a
man
who
has
no
vote
can
serve
himself
and
his
country
he
can
lift
up
his
hand
and
shout
forever
for
transome
let
the
workingmen
let
the
colliers
and
navvies
and
who
between
you
and
me
have
a
good
deal
too
much
the
worst
of
it
as
things
are
now
let
them
join
together
and
give
their
hands
and
voices
for
the
right
man
and
they
make
the
great
people
shake
in
their
shoes
a
little
and
when
you
shout
for
transome
remember
you
shout
for
more
wages
and
more
of
your
rights
and
you
shout
to
get
rid
of
rats
and
and
such
small
animals
who
are
the
tools
the
rich
make
use
of
to
squeeze
the
blood
out
of
the
poor
man
i
wish
there
be
a
row
i
pommel
him
said
dredge
who
was
generally
felt
to
be
speaking
to
the
question
no
no
my
friend
there
you
a
little
wrong
no
pommelling
no
striking
first
there
you
have
the
law
and
the
constable
against
you
a
little
rolling
in
the
dust
and
knocking
hats
off
a
little
pelting
with
soft
things
that
stick
and
not
bruise
all
that
does
spoil
the
fun
if
a
man
is
to
speak
when
you
do
like
to
hear
him
it
is
but
fair
you
should
give
him
something
he
does
like
in
return
and
the
same
if
he
got
a
vote
and
does
use
it
for
the
good
of
the
country
i
see
no
harm
in
splitting
his
coat
in
a
quiet
way
a
man
must
be
taught
what
right
if
he
does
know
it
but
no
kicks
no
knocking
down
no
pommelling
it
be
good
fun
though
if
said
old
sleck
allowing
himself
an
imaginative
pleasure
well
well
if
a
spratt
wants
you
to
say
garstin
it
some
pleasure
to
think
you
can
say
transome
now
my
notion
is
this
you
are
men
who
can
put
two
and
two
together
i
do
know
a
more
solid
lot
of
fellows
than
you
are
and
what
i
say
is
let
the
honest
men
in
this
country
got
no
vote
show
themselves
in
a
body
when
they
have
got
the
chance
why
sirs
for
every
tory
sneak
that
got
a
vote
there
fellows
who
must
stand
by
and
be
expected
to
hold
their
tongues
but
i
say
let
hiss
the
sneaks
let
groan
at
the
sneaks
and
the
sneaks
will
be
ashamed
of
themselves
the
men
who
got
votes
do
know
how
to
use
them
there
many
a
fool
with
a
vote
who
is
not
sure
in
his
mind
whether
he
shall
poll
say
for
debarry
or
garstin
or
transome
whether
he
plump
or
whether
he
split
a
straw
will
turn
him
let
him
know
your
mind
if
he
does
know
his
own
what
the
reason
debarry
gets
returned
because
people
are
frightened
at
the
debarrys
what
that
to
you
you
do
care
for
the
debarrys
if
people
are
frightened
at
the
tories
we
turn
round
and
frighten
you
know
what
a
tory
is
one
who
wants
to
drive
the
workingman
as
he
drive
cattle
that
what
a
tory
is
and
a
whig
is
no
better
if
he
like
garstin
a
whig
wants
to
knock
the
tory
down
and
get
the
whip
all
but
transome
neither
whig
nor
tory
he
the
workingman
friend
the
collier
friend
the
friend
of
the
honest
navvy
and
if
he
gets
into
parliament
let
me
tell
you
it
will
be
better
for
you
i
do
say
it
will
be
the
better
for
overlookers
and
screws
and
rats
and
but
it
will
be
the
better
for
every
good
fellow
who
takes
his

johnson

the
political

of
the
sproxton

did
not
stop
here
which
was
the
more
disinterested
in
him
as
he
did
not
expect
to
see
them
again
and
could
only
set
on
foot
an
organization
by
which
their
instruction
could
be
continued
without

in
this
he
was
quite
successful
a

known
among
the

already
been

joined

had
a
private
audience
of

he
might
be
instituted
as
the

much
resemblance
to

spreads
its

but
shows
you
the
wrong
side
of
the
ornament
liking
admiration
but
knowing
not
what
is
admirable
this
sunday
evening
which
promised
to
be
so
memorable
in
the
experience
of
the
sproxton
miners
had
its
drama
also
for
those
unsatisfactory
objects
to
johnson
moral
sense
the
debarrys
certain
incidents
occurring
at
treby
manor
caused
an
excitement
there
which
spread
from
the
to
the
stables
but
no
one
underwent
such
agitating
transitions
of
feeling
as
scales
at
six
that
superior
butler
was
chuckling
in
triumph
at
having
played
a
fine
and
original
practical
joke
on
his
rival
christian
some
two
hours
after
that
time
he
was
frightened
sorry
and
even
meek
he
was
on
the
brink
of
a
humiliating
confession
his
cheeks
were
almost
livid
his
hair
was
flattened
for
want
of
due
attention
from
his
fingers
and
the
fine
roll
of
his
whiskers
which
was
too
firm
to
give
way
seemed
only
a
sad
reminiscence
of
past
splendor
and
felicity
his
sorrow
came
about
in
this
wise
after
service
on
that
sunday
morning
philip
debarry
had
left
the
rest
of
the
family
to
go
home
in
the
carriage
and
had
remained
at
the
rectory
to
lunch
with
his
uncle
augustus
that
he
might
consult
him
touching
some
letters
of
importance
he
had
returned
the
letters
to
his
but
had
not
returned
the
book
to
his
pocket
and
he
finally
walked
away
leaving
the
enclosure
of
private
papers
and
on
his
uncle
escritoire
after
his
arrival
at
home
he
was
reminded
of
his
omission
and
immediately
dispatched
christian
with
a
note
begging
his
uncle
to
seal
up
the
and
send
it
by
the
bearer
this
commission
which
was
given
between
three
and
four
happened
to
be
very
unwelcome
to
the
courier
the
fact
was
that
christian
who
had
been
remarkable
through
life
for
that
power
of
adapting
himself
to
circumstances
which
enables
a
man
to
fall
safely
on
in
the
most
hurried
expulsions
and
escapes
was
not
exempt
from
bodily
suffering
a
circumstance
to
which
there
is
no
known
way
of
adapting
one
self
so
as
to
be
perfectly
comfortable
under
it
or
to
push
it
off
on
to
other
people
shoulders
he
did
what
he
could
he
took
doses
of
opium
when
he
had
an
access
of
nervous
pains
and
he
consoled
himself
as
to
future
possibilities
by
thinking
that
if
the
pains
ever
became
intolerably
frequent
a
considerable
increase
in
the
dose
might
put
an
end
to
them
altogether
he
was
neither
cato
nor
hamlet
and
though
he
had
learned
their
soliloquies
at
his
first
he
would
probably
have
increased
his
dose
without
reciting
those
next
to
the
pain
itself
he
disliked
that
any
one
should
know
of
it
defective
health
diminished
a
man
market
value
he
did
not
like
to
be
the
object
of
the
sort
of
pity
he
himself
gave
to
a
poor
devil
who
was
forced
to
make
a
wry
face
or
give
in
altogether
he
had
felt
it
expedient
to
take
a
slight
dose
this
afternoon
and
still
he
was
not
altogether
relieved
at
the
time
he
set
off
for
the
rectory
on
returning
with
the
valuable
case
safely
deposited
in
his
hind
pocket
he
felt
increasing
bodily
uneasiness
and
took
another
dose
thinking
it
likely
that
he
looked
rather
pitiable
he
chose
not
to
proceed
to
the
house
by
the
the
servants
often
walked
in
the
park
on
a
sunday
and
he
wished
to
avoid
any
meeting
he
would
make
a
circuit
get
into
the
house
privately
and
after
delivering
his
packet
to
debarry
shut
himself
up
till
the
ringing
of
the
bell
but
when
he
reached
an
elbowed
seat
under
some
sycamores
he
felt
so
ill
at
ease
that
he
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
throwing
himself
on
it
to
rest
a
little
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
but
five
he
had
done
his
errand
quickly
hitherto
and
debarry
had
not
urged
haste
but
in
less
than
ten
minutes
he
was
in
a
sound
sleep
certain
conditions
of
his
system
had
determined
a
stronger
effect
than
usual
from
the
opium
as
he
had
expected
there
were
servants
strolling
in
the
park
but
they
did
not
all
choose
the
most
frequented
part
scales
in
pursuit
of
a
light
flirtation
with
the
younger
lady
maid
had
preferred
a
more
sequestered
walk
in
the
company
of
that
agreeable
nymph
and
it
happened
to
be
this
pair
of
all
others
who
alighted
on
the
sleeping
christian
a
sight
which
at
the
very
first
moment
caused
scales
a
vague
pleasure
as
at
an
incident
that
must
lead
to
something
clever
on
his
part
to
play
a
trick
and
make
some
one
or
other
look
foolish
was
held
the
most
pointed
form
of
wit
throughout
the
back
regions
of
the
manor
and
served
as
a
constant
substitute
for
theatrical
entertainment
what
the
farce
wanted
in
costume
or
make
up
it
gained
in
the
reality
of
the
mortification
which
excited
the
general
laughter
and
lo
here
was
the
offensive
the
exasperatingly
cool
and
superior
christian
caught
comparatively
helpless
with
his
head
hanging
on
his
shoulder
and
one
hanging
out
heavily
below
the
elbow
of
the
rustic
seat
it
was
this
which
served
as
a
suggestion
to
genius
putting
his
finger
up
in
warning
to
cherry
and
saying
hush
be
quiet
i
see
a
fine
bit
of
fun
he
took
a
knife
from
his
pocket
stepped
behind
the
unconscious
christian
and
quickly
cut
off
the
pendent
scales
knew
nothing
of
the
errand
to
the
rectory
and
as
he
noticed
that
there
was
something
in
the
pocket
thought
it
was
probably
a
large
so
much
the
better
he
had
no
time
to
pause
he
threw
the
as
far
as
he
could
and
noticed
that
it
fell
among
the
elms
under
which
they
had
been
walking
then
beckoning
to
mrs
cherry
he
hurried
away
with
her
toward
the
more
open
part
of
the
park
not
daring
to
explode
in
laughter
until
it
was
safe
from
the
chance
of
waking
the
sleeper
and
then
the
vision
of
the
graceful
christian
who
sneered
at
scales
about
his
get
up
having
to
walk
back
to
the
house
with
only
one
tail
to
his
coat
was
a
source
of
so
much
enjoyment
to
the
butler
that
the
fair
cherry
began
to
be
quite
jealous
of
the
joke
still
she
admitted
that
it
really
was
funny
tittered
intermittently
and
pledged
herself
to
secrecy
scales
explained
to
her
that
christian
would
try
to
creep
in
unobserved
but
that
this
must
be
made
impossible
and
he
requested
her
to
imagine
the
figure
this
interloping
fellow
would
cut
when
everybody
was
asking
what
had
happened
hallo
christian
where
your
coat
tail
would
become
a
proverb
at
the
manor
where
jokes
kept
remarkably
well
without
the
aid
of
salt
and
christian
comb
would
be
cut
so
effectually
that
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
grow
again
exit
scales
laughing
and
presenting
a
fine
example
of
dramatic
irony
to
any
one
in
the
secret
of
fate
when
christian
awoke
he
was
shocked
to
find
himself
in
the
twilight
he
started
up
shook
himself
missed
something
and
soon
became
aware
what
it
was
he
missed
he
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
been
robbed
and
he
at
once
foresaw
that
the
consequences
would
be
highly
unpleasant
in
no
way
could
the
cause
of
the
accident
be
so
represented
to
philip
debarry
as
to
prevent
him
from
viewing
his
hitherto
unimpeachable
factotum
in
a
new
and
unfavorable
light
and
though
christian
did
not
regard
his
present
position
as
brilliant
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
anything
better
a
man
nearly
fifty
who
is
not
always
quite
well
is
seldom
ardently
hopeful
he
is
aware
that
this
is
a
world
in
which
merit
is
often
overlooked
with
the
idea
of
robbery
in
full
possession
of
his
mind
to
peer
about
and
search
in
the
dimness
even
if
it
had
occurred
to
him
would
have
seemed
a
preposterous
waste
of
time
and
energy
he
knew
it
was
likely
that
debarry
had
important
and
valuable
contents
and
that
he
should
deepen
his
offence
by
deferring
his
announcement
of
the
unfortunate
fact
he
hastened
back
to
the
house
relieved
by
the
obscurity
from
that
mortification
of
his
vanity
on
which
the
butler
had
counted
indeed
to
scales
himself
the
affair
had
already
begun
to
appear
less
thoroughly
jocose
than
he
had
anticipated
for
he
observed
that
christian
before
dinner
had
caused
debarry
some
consternation
and
he
had
gathered
that
the
courier
had
been
sent
on
a
commission
to
the
rectory
my
uncle
must
have
detained
him
for
some
reason
or
other
he
heard
philip
say
but
it
is
odd
if
he
were
less
trusty
about
commissions
or
had
ever
seemed
to
drink
too
much
i
should
be
uneasy
altogether
the
affair
was
not
taking
the
turn
scales
had
intended
at
last
when
dinner
had
been
removed
and
the
butler
chief
duties
were
at
an
end
it
was
understood
that
christian
had
entered
without
his
coat
tail
looking
serious
and
even
agitated
that
he
had
asked
leave
at
once
to
speak
to
debarry
and
that
he
was
even
then
in
parley
with
the
gentleman
in
the
scales
was
in
alarm
it
must
have
been
some
property
of
that
had
weighted
the
pocket
he
took
a
lantern
got
a
groom
to
accompany
him
with
another
lantern
and
with
the
utmost
practical
speed
reached
the
fatal
spot
in
the
park
he
searched
under
the
elms
he
was
certain
that
the
pocket
had
fallen
there
and
he
found
the
pocket
but
he
found
it
empty
and
in
spite
of
further
search
did
not
find
the
contents
though
he
had
first
consoled
himself
with
thinking
that
they
had
fallen
out
and
would
be
lying
not
far
off
he
returned
with
the
lanterns
and
the
coat
tail
and
a
most
uncomfortable
consciousness
in
that
great
seat
of
a
butler
emotion
the
stomach
he
had
no
sooner
than
he
was
met
by
cherry
pale
and
anxious
who
drew
him
aside
to
say
that
if
he
did
tell
everything
she
would
that
the
constables
were
to
be
sent
for
that
there
had
been
no
end
of
and
letters
and
things
in
debarry
which
christian
was
carrying
in
that
very
pocket
scales
had
cut
off
that
the
rector
was
sent
for
the
constable
was
coming
and
they
should
all
be
hanged
scales
own
intellect
was
anything
but
clear
as
to
the
possible
issues
and
with
the
in
his
hands
as
an
attestation
that
he
was
innocent
of
anything
more
than
a
joke
he
went
and
made
his
confession
his
story
relieved
christian
a
little
but
did
not
relieve
debarry
who
was
more
annoyed
at
the
loss
of
the
letters
and
the
chance
of
their
getting
into
hands
that
might
make
use
of
them
than
at
the
loss
of
the
nothing
could
be
done
for
the
present
but
that
the
rector
who
was
a
magistrate
should
instruct
the
constables
and
that
the
spot
in
the
park
indicated
by
scales
should
again
be
carefully
searched
this
was
done
but
in
vain
and
many
of
the
family
at
the
manor
had
disturbed
sleep
that
night

awhile
to

to
this
submission
meanwhile
felix
holt
had
been
making
his
way
back
from
sproxton
to
treby
in
some
irritation
and
bitterness
of
spirit
for
a
little
while
he
walked
slowly
along
the
direct
road
hoping
that
johnson
would
overtake
him
in
which
case
he
would
have
the
pleasure
of
quarrelling
with
him
and
telling
him
what
he
thought
of
his
intentions
in
coming
to
cant
at
the
sugar
loaf
but
he
presently
checked
himself
in
this
folly
and
turned
off
again
toward
the
canal
that
he
might
avoid
the
temptation
of
getting
into
a
passion
to
no
purpose
where
the
good
he
thought
of
pulling
at
such
a
tangled
skein
as
this
electioneering
trickery
as
long
as
of
the
men
in
this
country
see
nothing
in
an
election
but
and
nothing
in
but
some
form
of
greed

might
as
well
try
to
purify
the
proceedings

to
a
hungry
good
friend
abstain
do
goggle
your
eyes
so
or
show
such
a
stupid
gluttonous
mouth
or

the
little
fishes
are

in

inside
he
be
open
to
no
argument
short
of
crimping
him
i
should
get
into
a
rage
with
this
fellow
and
perhaps
end
by
thrashing
him
there
some
reason
in
me
as
long
as
i
keep
my
temper
but
my
rash
humor
is
drunkenness
without
wine
i
should
wonder
if
he
upsets
all
my
plans
with
these
colliers
of
course
he
going
to
treat
them
for
the
sake
of
getting
up
a
posse
at
the
nomination
and
speechifyings
they
drink
double
and
never
come
near
me
on
a
saturday
evening
i
do
know
what
sort
of
man
transome
really
is
no
use
my
speaking
to
anybody
else
but
if
i
could
get
at
him
he
might
put
a
veto
on
this
thing
though
when
once
the
men
have
been
promised
and
set
the
mischief
is
likely
to
be
past
mending
hang
the
liberal
i
should
have
minded
so
much
if
he
been
a
tory
felix
went
along
in
the
twilight
struggling
in
this
way
with
the
intricacies
of
life
which
would
certainly
be
greatly
simplified
if
corrupt
practices
were
the
invariable
mark
of
wrong
opinions
when
he
had
crossed
the
common
and
had
entered
the
park
the
overshadowing
trees
deepened
the
gray
gloom
of
the
evening
it
was
useless
to
try
and
keep
the
blind
path
and
he
could
only
be
careful
that
his
steps
should
be
bent
in
the
direction
of
the
park
gate
he
was
striding
along
rapidly
now
whistling
bannockburn
in
a
subdued
way
as
an
accompaniment
to
his
inward
discussion
when
something
smooth
and
soft
on
which
his
foot
alighted
arrested
him
with
an
unpleasant
startling
sensation
and
made
him
stoop
to
examine
the
object
he
was
treading
on
he
found
it
to
be
a
large
leather
swelled
by
its
contents
and
fastened
with
a
sealed
ribbon
as
well
as
a
clasp
in
stooping
he
saw
about
a
yard
off
something
whitish
and
square
lying
on
the
dark
grass
this
was
an
ornamental
of
pale
leather
stamped
with
gold
apparently
it
had
burst
open
in
falling
and
out
of
the
pocket
formed
by
the
cover
there
protruded
a
small
gold
chain
about
four
inches
long
with
various
seals
and
other
trifles
attached
to
it
by
a
ring
at
the
end
felix
thrust
the
chain
back
and
finding
that
the
clasp
of
the
was
broken
he
closed
it
and
thrust
it
into
his
walking
along
under
some
annoyance
that
fortune
had
made
him
the
finder
of
articles
belonging
most
probably
to
one
of
the
family
at
treby
manor
he
was
much
too
proud
a
man
to
like
any
contact
with
the
aristocracy
and
he
could
still
less
endure
coming
within
speech
of
their
servants
some
plan
must
be
devised
by
which
he
could
avoid
carrying
these
things
up
to
the
manor
himself
he
thought
at
first
of
leaving
them
at
the
lodge
but
he
had
a
scruple
against
placing
property
of
which
the
ownership
was
after
all
uncertain
in
the
hands
of
persons
unknown
to
him
it
was
possible
that
the
large
contained
papers
of
high
importance
and
that
it
did
not
belong
to
any
of
the
debarry
family
he
resolved
at
last
to
carry
his
findings
to
lyon
who
would
perhaps
be
enough
to
save
him
from
the
necessary
transactions
with
the
people
at
the
manor
by
undertaking
those
transactions
himself
with
this
determination
he
walked
straight
to
malthouse
yard
and
waited
outside
the
chapel
until
the
congregation
was
dispersing
when
he
passed
along
the
aisle
to
the
vestry
in
order
to
speak
to
the
minister
in
private
but
lyon
was
not
alone
when
felix
entered
nuttwood
the
grocer
who
was
one
of
the
deacons
was
complaining
to
him
about
the
obstinate
demeanor
of
the
singers
who
had
declined
to
change
the
tunes
in
accordance
with
a
change
in
the
selection
of
hymns
and
had
stretched
short
metre
into
long
out
of
pure
wilfulness
and
defiance
irreverently
adapting
the
most
sacred
monosyllables
to
a
multitude
of
quavers
arranged
it
was
to
be
feared
by
some
musician
who
was
inspired
by
conceit
rather
than
by
the
true
spirit
of
psalmody
come
in
my
friend
said
lyon
smiling
at
felix
and
then
continuing
in
a
faint
voice
while
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
bald
crown
brother
nuttwood
we
must
be
content
to
carry
a
thorn
in
our
sides
while
the
necessities
of
our
imperfect
state
demand
that
there
should
be
a
body
set
apart
and
called
a
choir
whose
special
office
it
is
to
lead
the
singing
not
because
they
are
more
disposed
to
the
devout
uplifting
of
praise
but
because
they
are
endowed
with
better
vocal
organs
and
have
attained
more
of
the
musician
art
for
all
office
unless
it
be
accompanied
by
peculiar
grace
becomes
as
it
were
a
diseased
organ
seeking
to
make
itself
too
much
of
a
centre
singers
specially
so
called
are
it
must
be
confessed
an
anomaly
among
us
who
seek
to
reduce
the
church
to
its
primitive
simplicity
and
to
cast
away
all
that
may
obstruct
the
direct
communion
of
spirit
with
spirit
they
are
so
headstrong
said
nuttwood
in
a
tone
of
sad
perplexity
that
if
we
dealt
not
warily
with
them
they
might
end
in
dividing
the
church
even
now
that
we
have
had
the
chapel
enlarged
brother
kemp
would
side
with
them
and
draw
the
half
part
of
the
members
after
him
i
can
not
but
think
it
a
snare
when
a
professing
christian
has
a
bass
voice
like
brother
kemp
it
makes
him
desire
to
be
heard
of
men
but
the
weaker
song
of
the
humble
may
have
more
power
in
the
ear
of
god
do
you
think
it
any
better
vanity
to
flatter
yourself
that
god
likes
to
hear
you
though
men
do
said
felix
with
unwarrantable
bluntness
the
civil
grocer
was
prepared
to
be
scandalized
by
anything
that
came
from
felix
in
common
with
many
hearers
in
malthouse
yard
he
already
felt
an
objection
to
a
young
man
who
was
notorious
for
having
interfered
in
a
question
of
wholesale
and
retail
which
should
have
been
left
to
providence
old
holt
being
a
church
member
had
probably
had
leadings
which
were
more
to
be
relied
on
than
his
son
boasted
knowledge
in
any
case
a
little
visceral
disturbance
and
inward
chastisement
to
the
consumers
of
questionable
medicines
would
tend
less
to
obscure
the
divine
glory
than
a
show
of
punctilious
morality
in
one
who
was
not
a
professor
besides
how
was
it
to
be
known
that
the
medicines
would
not
be
blessed
if
taken
with
due
trust
in
a
higher
influence
a
christian
must
consider
not
the
medicines
alone
in
their
relation
to
our
frail
bodies
which
are
dust
but
the
medicines
with
omnipotence
behind
them
hence
a
pious
vendor
will
look
for
leadings
and
he
is
likely
to
find
them
in
the
cessation
of
demand
and
the
disproportion
of
expenses
and
returns
the
grocer
was
thus
on
his
guard
against
the
presumptuous
disputant
lyon
may
understand
you
sir
he
replied
he
seems
to
be
fond
of
your
conversation
but
you
have
too
much
of
the
pride
of
human
learning
for
me
i
follow
no
new
lights
then
follow
an
old
one
said
felix
mischievously
disposed
toward
a
sleek
tradesman
follow
the
light
of
the
presbyterians
that
i
heard
sing
at
glasgow
the
preacher
gives
out
the
psalm
and
then
everybody
sings
a
different
tune
as
it
happens
to
turn
up
in
their
throats
it
a
domineering
thing
to
set
a
tune
and
expect
everybody
else
to
follow
it
it
a
denial
of
private
judgment
hush
hush
my
young
friend
said
lyon
hurt
by
this
levity
which
glanced
at
himself
as
well
as
at
the
deacon
play
not
with
paradoxes
that
caustic
which
you
handle
in
order
to
scorch
others
may
happen
to
sear
your
own
fingers
and
make
them
dead
to
the
quality
of
things
is
difficult
enough
to
see
our
way
and
keep
our
torch
steady
in
this
dim
labyrinth
to
whirl
the
torch
and
dazzle
the
eyes
of
our
is
a
poor
daring
and
may
end
in
total
darkness
you
yourself
are
a
lover
of
freedom
and
a
bold
rebel
against
usurping
authority
but
the
right
to
rebellion
is
the
right
to
seek
a
higher
rule
and
not
to
wander
in
mere
lawlessness
wherefore
i
beseech
you
seem
not
to
say
that
liberty
is
license
and
i
apprehend
though
i
am
not
endowed
with
an
ear
to
seize
those
earthly
harmonies
which
to
some
devout
souls
have
seemed
as
it
were
the
broken
echoes
of
the
heavenly
choir
i
apprehend
that
there
is
a
law
in
music
disobedience
whereunto
would
bring
us
in
our
singing
to
the
level
of
shrieking
maniacs
or
howling
beasts
so
that
herein
we
are
well
instructed
how
true
liberty
can
be
nought
but
the
transfer
of
obedience
from
the
will
of
one
or
of
a
few
men
to
that
will
which
is
the
norm
or
rule
for
all
men
and
though
the
transfer
may
sometimes
be
but
an
erroneous
direction
of
search
yet
is
the
search
good
and
necessary
to
the
ultimate
finding
and
even
as
in
music
where
all
obey
and
concur
to
one
end
so
that
each
has
the
joy
of
contributing
to
a
whole
whereby
he
is
ravished
and
lifted
up
into
the
courts
of
heaven
so
will
it
be
in
that
crowning
time
of
the
millennial
reign
when
our
daily
prayer
will
be
fulfilled
and
one
law
shall
be
written
on
all
hearts
and
be
the
very
structure
of
all
thought
and
be
the
principle
of
all
action
tired
even
exhausted
as
the
minister
had
been
when
felix
holt
entered
the
gathering
excitement
of
speech
gave
more
and
more
energy
to
his
voice
and
manner
he
walked
away
from
the
vestry
table
he
paused
and
came
back
to
it
he
walked
away
again
then
came
back
and
ended
with
his
deepest
toned
largo
keeping
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
while
his
brown
eyes
were
bright
with
the
lasting
youthfulness
of
enthusiastic
thought
and
love
but
to
any
one
who
had
no
share
in
the
energies
that
were
thrilling
his
little
body
he
would
have
looked
queer
enough
no
sooner
had
he
finished
his
eager
speech
than
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
deacon
and
said
in
his
former
faint
tone
of
fatigue
god
be
with
you
brother
we
shall
meet
and
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
to
subdue
these
refractory
spirits
when
the
deacon
was
gone
felix
said
forgive
me
lyon
i
was
wrong
and
you
are
right
yes
yes
my
friend
you
have
that
mark
of
grace
within
you
that
you
are
ready
to
acknowledge
the
justice
of
a
rebuke
sit
down
you
have
something
to
say
some
packet
there
they
sat
down
at
a
corner
of
the
small
table
and
felix
drew
the
from
his
pocket
to
lay
it
down
with
the
saying
i
had
the
to
be
the
finder
of
these
things
in
the
park
most
likely
they
belong
to
one
of
the
family
at
the
manor
or
to
some
grandee
who
is
staying
there
i
hate
having
anything
to
do
with
such
people
they
think
me
a
poor
rascal
and
offer
me
money
you
are
a
known
man
and
i
thought
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
relieve
me
by
taking
charge
of
these
things
and
writing
to
debarry
not
mentioning
me
and
asking
him
to
send
some
one
for
them
i
found
them
on
the
grass
in
the
park
this
evening
about
seven
in
the
corner
we
cross
going
to
sproxton
stay
said
lyon
this
little
book
is
open
we
may
venture
to
look
in
it
for
some
sign
of
ownership
there
be
others
who
possess
property
and
might
be
crossing
that
end
of
the
park
besides
the
debarrys
as
he
lifted
the
close
to
his
eyes
the
chain
again
slipped
out
he
arrested
it
and
held
it
in
his
hand
while
he
examined
some
writing
which
appeared
to
be
a
name
on
the
inner
leather
he
looked
long
as
if
he
were
trying
to
decipher
something
that
was
partly
rubbed
out
and
his
hands
began
to
tremble
noticeably
he
made
a
movement
in
an
agitated
manner
as
if
he
were
going
to
examine
the
chain
and
seals
which
he
held
in
his
hand
but
he
checked
himself
closed
his
hand
again
and
rested
it
on
the
table
while
with
the
other
hand
he
pressed
the
sides
of
the
together
felix
observed
his
agitation
and
was
much
surprised
but
with
a
delicacy
of
which
he
was
capable
under
all
his
abruptness
he
said
you
are
overcome
with
fatigue
sir
i
was
thoughtless
to
tease
you
with
these
matters
at
the
end
of
sunday
when
you
have
been
preaching
three
sermons
lyon
did
not
speak
for
a
few
moments
but
at
last
he
said
it
is
true
i
am
overcome
it
was
a
name
i
saw
a
name
that
called
up
a
past
sorrow
fear
not
i
will
do
what
is
needful
with
these
things
you
may
trust
them
to
me
with
trembling
fingers
he
replaced
the
chain
and
tied
both
the
large
and
the
in
his
handkerchief
he
was
evidently
making
a
great
effort
over
himself
but
when
he
had
gathered
the
knot
of
the
handkerchief
in
his
hand
he
said
give
me
your
arm
to
the
door
my
friend
i
feel
ill
doubtless
i
am
the
door
was
already
open
and
lyddy
was
watching
for
her
return
felix
therefore
said
and
passed
on
sure
that
this
was
what
lyon
would
prefer
the
minister
supper
of
warm
porridge
was
ready
by
the
where
he
always
took
it
on
a
sunday
evening
and
afterward
smoked
his
weekly
pipe
up
the
broad
chimney
the
one
great
relaxation
he
allowed
himself
smoking
he
considered
was
a
recreation
of
the
travailled
spirit
which
if
indulged
in
might
endear
this
world
to
us
by
the
ignoble
bonds
of
mere
sensuous
ease
daily
smoking
might
be
lawful
but
it
was
not
expedient
and
in
this
esther
concurred
with
a
doctrinal
eagerness
that
was
unusual
in
her
it
was
her
habit
to
go
to
her
own
room
professedly
to
bed
very
early
on
sundays
immediately
on
her
return
from
chapel
that
she
might
avoid
her
father
pipe
but
this
evening
she
had
remained
at
home
under
a
true
plea
of
not
feeling
well
and
when
she
heard
him
enter
she
ran
out
of
the
parlor
to
meet
him
father
you
are
ill
she
said
as
he
tottered
to
the
while
lyddy
stood
by
shaking
her
head
no
my
dear
he
answered
feebly
as
she
took
off
his
hat
and
looked
in
his
face
enquiringly
i
am
weary
let
me
lay
these
things
down
for
you
said
esther
touching
the
bundle
in
the
handkerchief
no
they
are
matters
which
i
have
to
examine
he
said
laying
them
on
the
table
and
putting
his
arm
across
them
go
you
to
bed
lyddy
not
me
sir
if
ever
a
man
looked
as
if
he
was
struck
with
death
you
this
very
night
as
here
is
nonsense
lyddy
said
esther
angrily
go
to
bed
when
my
father
desires
it
i
will
stay
with
him
lyddy
was
electrified
by
surprise
at
this
new
behavior
of
miss
esther
she
took
her
candle
silently
and
went
go
you
too
my
dear
said
lyon
tenderly
giving
his
hand
to
esther
when
lyddy
was
gone
it
is
your
wont
to
go
early
why
are
you
up
let
me
lift
your
porridge
from
before
the
fire
and
stay
with
you
father
you
think
i
so
naughty
that
i
do
like
doing
anything
for
you
said
esther
smiling
rather
sadly
at
him
child
what
has
happened
you
have
become
the
image
of
your
mother
said
the
minister
in
a
loud
whisper
the
tears
came
and
relieved
him
while
esther
who
had
stooped
to
lift
the
porridge
from
the
fender
paused
on
one
knee
and
looked
up
at
him
she
was
very
good
to
you
asked
esther
softly
yes
dear
she
did
not
reject
my
affection
she
thought
not
scorn
of
my
love
she
would
have
forgiven
me
if
i
had
erred
against
her
from
very
tenderness
could
you
forgive
me
child
father
i
have
not
been
good
to
you
but
i
will
be
i
will
be
said
esther
laying
her
head
on
his
knee
he
kissed
her
head
go
to
bed
dear
i
would
be
alone
when
esther
was
lying
down
that
night
she
felt
as
if
the
little
incidents
between
herself
and
her
father
on
this
sunday
had
made
it
an
epoch
very
slight
words
and
deeds
may
have
a
sacramental
efficacy
if
we
can
cast
our
behind
us
in
order
to
say
or
do
them
and
it
has
been
well
believed
through
many
ages
that
the
beginning
of
compunction
is
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
that
the
mind
which
sees
itself
blameless
may
be
called
dead
in
trespasses
in
trespasses
on
the
love
of
others
in
trespasses
on
their
weakness
in
trespasses
on
all
those
great
claims
which
are
the
image
of
our
own
need
but
esther
persisted
in
assuring
herself
that
she
was
not
bending
to
any
criticism
from
felix
she
was
full
of
resentment
against
his
rudeness
and
yet
more
against
his
too
harsh
conception
of
her
character
she
was
determined
to
keep
as
much
at
a
distance
from
him
as
possible

this

at
a
sudden
blow
his
soul
rings
hard
i
can
not
lay
my
palm
trembling
with
life
upon
that
jointed
brass
i
shudder
at
the
cold

but
if
it
press
me
in

bruised
the
next
morning
when
the
debarrys
including
the
rector
who
had
ridden
over
to
the
manor
early
were
still
seated
at
breakfast
christian
came
in
with
a
letter
saying
that
it
had
been
brought
by
a
man
employed
at
the
chapel
in
malthouse
yard
who
had
been
ordered
by
the
minister
to
use
all
speed
and
care
in
the
delivery
the
letter
was
addressed
to
sir
maximus
stay
christian
it
may
possibly
refer
to
the
lost
said
philip
debarry
who
was
beginning
to
feel
rather
sorry
for
his
factotum
as
a
reaction
from
previous
suspicions
and
indignation
sir
maximus
opened
the
letter
and
felt
for
his
glasses
but
then
said
here
you
read
it
phil
the
man
writes
a
hand
like
small
print
philip
cast
his
eyes
over
it
and
then
read
aloud
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
sir
i
send
this
letter
to
apprise
you
that
i
have
now
in
my
possession
certain
articles
which
last
evening
at
about
seven
were
found
lying
on
the
grass
at
the
western
extremity
of
your
park
the
articles
are
a
of
brown
leather
fastened
with
a
black
ribbon
and
with
a
seal
of
red
wax
a
small
covered
with
gilded
vellum
whereof
the
clasp
was
burst
and
from
out
whereof
had
partly
escaped
a
small
chain
with
seals
and
a
locket
attached
the
locket
bearing
on
the
back
a
device
and
round
the
face
a
female
name
whereof
i
request
that
you
will
further
my
effort
to
place
these
articles
in
the
right
hands
by
ascertaining
whether
any
person
within
your
walls
claims
them
as
his
property
and
by
sending
that
person
to
me
if
such
be
found
for
i
will
on
no
account
let
them
pass
from
my
care
save
into
that
of
one
who
declaring
himself
to
be
the
owner
can
state
to
me
what
is
the
impression
on
the
seal
and
what
the
device
and
name
upon
the
locket
i
am
sir
yours
to
command
in
all
right
dealing

rufus
lyon
well
done
old
lyon
said
the
rector
i
did
think
that
any
composition
of
his
would
ever
give
me
so
much
pleasure
what
an
old
fox
it
is
said
sir
maximus
why
could
he
send
the
things
to
me
at
once
along
with
the
letter
no
no
max
he
uses
a
justifiable
caution
said
the
rector
a
refined
and
rather
severe
likeness
of
his
brother
with
a
ring
of
fearlessness
and
decision
in
his
voice
which
startled
all
flaccid
men
and
unruly
boys
what
are
you
going
to
do
phil
he
added
seeing
his
nephew
rise
to
write
of
course
those
other
matters
are
yours
i
suppose
said
debarry
looking
at
christian
yes
sir
i
shall
send
you
with
a
letter
to
the
preacher
you
can
describe
your
own
property
and
the
seal
uncle
was
it
your
no
it
was
this
head
of
achilles
here
i
can
take
it
off
the
ring
and
you
can
carry
it
christian
but
do
lose
that
for
i
had
it
ever
since
eighteen
hundred
i
should
like
to
send
my
compliments
with
it
the
rector
went
on
looking
at
his
brother
and
beg
that
since
he
has
so
much
wise
caution
at
command
he
would
exercise
a
little
in
more
public
matters
instead
of
making
himself
a
firebrand
in
my
parish
and
teaching
hucksters
and
that
it
their
business
to
dictate
to
statesmen
how
did
dissenters
and
methodists
and
quakers
and
people
of
that
sort
first
come
up
uncle
said
miss
selina
a
radiant
girl
of
twenty
who
had
given
much
time
to
the
harp
dear
me
selina
said
her
elder
sister
harriet
whose
forte
was
general
knowledge
do
you
remember
they
were
in
cromwell
time
oh
holdenough
and
those
people
yes
but
they
preached
in
the
churches
they
had
no
chapels
tell
me
uncle
gus
i
like
to
be
wise
said
selina
looking
up
at
the
face
which
was
smiling
down
on
her
with
a
sort
of
severe
benignity
phil
says
i
an
ignorant
puss
the
seeds
of
nonconformity
were
sown
at
the
reformation
my
dear
when
some
obstinate
man
made
scruples
about
surplices
and
the
place
of
the
and
other
trifles
of
that
sort
but
the
quakers
came
up
about
cromwell
time
and
the
methodists
only
in
the
last
century
the
first
methodists
were
regular
clergymen
the
more
the
pity
but
all
those
wrong
things
why
did
government
put
them
down
ah
to
be
sure
fell
in
sir
maximus
in
a
cordial
tone
of
corroboration
because
error
is
often
strong
and
government
is
often
weak
my
dear
well
phil
have
you
finished
your
letter
yes
i
will
read
it
to
you
said
philip
turning
and
leaning
over
the
back
of
his
chair
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
there
is
a
portrait
of
philip
debarry
still
to
be
seen
at
treby
manor
and
a
very
fine
bust
of
him
at
rome
where
he
died
fifteen
years
later
a
convert
to
catholicism
his
face
would
have
been
plain
but
for
the
exquisite
setting
of
his
hazel
eyes
which
fascinated
even
the
dogs
of
the
household
the
other
features
though
slight
and
irregular
were
redeemed
from
triviality
by
the
stamp
of
gravity
and
intellectual
preoccupation
in
his
face
and
bearing
as
he
read
aloud
his
voice
was
what
his
uncle
might
have
been
if
it
had
been
modulated
by
delicate
health
and
a
visitation
of
sir
in
reply
to
the
letter
with
which
you
have
favored
me
this
morning
i
beg
to
state
that
the
articles
you
describe
were
lost
from
the
pocket
of
my
servant
who
is
the
bearer
of
this
letter
to
you
and
is
the
claimant
of
the
vellum
and
the
gold
chain
the
large
leathern
is
my
own
property
and
the
impression
on
the
wax
a
helmeted
head
of
achilles
was
made
by
my
uncle
the
reverend
augustus
debarry
who
allows
me
to
forward
this
seal
to
you
in
proof
that
i
am
not
making
a
mistaken
claim
i
feel
myself
under
deep
obligation
to
you
sir
for
the
care
and
trouble
you
have
taken
in
order
to
restore
to
its
right
owner
a
piece
of
property
which
happens
to
be
of
particular
importance
to
me
and
i
shall
consider
myself
doubly
fortunate
if
at
any
time
you
can
point
out
to
me
some
method
by
which
i
may
procure
you
as
lively
a
satisfaction
as
i
am
now
feeling
in
that
full
and
speedy
relief
from
anxiety
which
i
owe
to
your
considerate
conduct
i
remain
sir
your
obliged
and
faithful
servant
philip
debarry
you
know
best
phil
of
course
said
sir
maximus
pushing
his
plate
from
him
by
way
of
interjection
but
it
seems
to
me
you
exaggerate
preposterously
every
little
service
a
man
happens
to
do
for
you
why
should
you
make
a
general
offer
of
that
sort
how
do
you
know
what
he
will
be
asking
you
to
do
stuff
and
nonsense
tell
willis
to
send
him
a
few
head
of
game
you
should
think
twice
before
you
give
a
blank
check
of
that
sort
to
one
of
these
quibbling
meddlesome
radicals
you
are
afraid
of
my
committing
myself
to
bottomless
perjury
of
an
et
cetera
said
philip
smiling
as
he
turned
to
fold
his
letter
but
i
think
i
am
not
doing
any
mischief
at
all
events
i
could
not
be
content
to
say
less
and
i
have
a
notion
that
he
would
regard
a
present
of
game
just
now
as
an
insult
i
should
in
his
place
yes
yes
you
but
you
do
make
yourself
a
measure
of
dissenting
preachers
i
hope
said
sir
maximus
rather
wrathfully
what
do
you
say
gus
phil
is
right
said
the
rector
in
an
absolute
tone
i
would
not
deal
with
a
dissenter
or
put
profits
into
the
pocket
of
a
radical
which
i
might
put
into
the
pocket
of
a
good
churchman
and
a
quiet
subject
but
if
the
greatest
scoundrel
in
the
world
made
way
for
me
or
picked
my
hat
up
i
would
thank
him
so
would
you
max
pooh
i
did
mean
that
one
should
behave
like
a
gentleman
said
sir
maximus
in
some
vexation
he
had
great
pride
in
his
superiority
even
to
himself
but
he
did
not
quite
trust
the
dim
vision
opened
by
phil
new
words
and
new
notions
he
could
only
submit
in
silence
while
the
letter
was
delivered
to
christian
with
the
order
to
start
for
malthouse
yard
immediately
meanwhile
in
that
somewhat
dim
locality
the
possible
claimant
of
the
and
the
chain
was
thought
of
and
expected
with
palpitating
agitation
lyon
was
seated
in
his
study
looking
haggard
and
already
aged
from
a
sleepless
night
he
was
so
afraid
lest
his
emotion
should
deprive
him
of
the
presence
of
mind
necessary
to
the
due
attention
to
particulars
in
the
coming
interview
that
he
continued
to
occupy
his
sight
and
touch
with
the
objects
which
had
stirred
the
depths
not
only
of
memory
but
of
dread
once
again
he
unlocked
a
small
box
which
stood
beside
his
desk
and
took
from
it
a
little
oval
locket
and
compared
this
with
one
which
hung
with
the
seals
on
the
stray
gold
chain
there
was
the
same
device
in
enamel
on
the
back
of
both
clasped
hands
surrounded
with
blue
flowers
both
had
round
the
face
a
name
in
gold
italics
on
a
blue
ground
the
name
on
the
locket
taken
from
the
drawer
was
the
name
on
the
locket
which
hung
with
the
seals
was
and
within
the
circle
of
this
name
there
was
a
lover
knot
of
light
brown
hair
which
matched
a
curl
that
lay
in
the
box
the
hair
in
the
locket
which
bore
the
name
of
maurice
was
of
a
very
dark
brown
and
before
returning
it
to
the
drawer
lyon
noted
the
color
and
quality
of
this
hair
more
carefully
than
ever
then
he
recurred
to
the
undoubtedly
there
had
been
something
probably
a
third
name
beyond
the
names
which
had
themselves
been
rubbed
and
slightly
smeared
as
if
by
accident
and
from
the
very
first
examination
in
the
vestry
lyon
could
not
prevent
himself
from
transferring
the
mental
image
of
the
third
name
in
faint
lines
to
the
rubbed
leather
the
leaves
of
the
seemed
to
have
been
recently
inserted
they
were
of
fresh
white
paper
and
only
bore
some
abbreviations
in
pencil
with
a
notation
of
small
sums
nothing
could
be
gathered
from
the
comparison
of
the
writing
in
the
book
with
that
of
the
yellow
letters
which
lay
in
the
box
the
smeared
name
had
been
carefully
printed
and
so
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
signature
of
those
letters
and
the
pencil
abbreviations
and
figures
had
been
made
too
hurriedly
to
bear
any
decisive
witness
i
will
ask
him
to
write
to
write
a
description
of
the
locket
had
been
one
of
lyon
thoughts
but
he
faltered
in
that
intention
his
power
of
fulfilling
it
must
depend
on
what
he
saw
in
this
visitor
of
whose
coming
he
had
a
horrible
dread
at
the
very
time
he
was
writing
to
demand
it
in
that
demand
he
was
obeying
the
voice
of
his
rigid
conscience
which
had
never
left
him
perfectly
at
rest
under
his
one
act
of
deception
the
concealment
from
esther
that
he
was
not
her
natural
father
the
assertion
of
a
false
claim
upon
her
let
my
path
be
henceforth
simple
he
had
said
to
himself
in
the
anguish
of
that
night
let
me
seek
to
know
what
is
and
if
possible
to
declare
it
if
he
was
really
going
to
find
himself
face
to
face
with
the
man
who
had
been
annette
husband
and
who
was
esther
father
if
that
wandering
of
his
from
the
light
had
brought
the
punishment
of
a
blind
sacrilege
as
the
issue
of
a
conscious
transgression
he
prayed
that
he
might
be
able
to
accept
all
consequences
of
pain
to
himself
but
he
saw
other
possibilities
concerning
the
claimant
of
the
book
and
chain
his
ignorance
and
suspicions
as
to
the
history
and
character
of
annette
husband
made
it
credible
that
he
had
laid
a
plan
for
convincing
her
of
his
death
as
a
means
of
freeing
himself
from
a
burdensome
tie
but
it
seemed
equally
probable
that
he
was
really
dead
and
that
these
articles
of
property
had
been
a
bequest
or
a
payment
or
even
a
sale
to
their
present
owner
indeed
in
all
these
years
there
was
no
knowing
into
how
many
hands
such
pretty
trifles
might
have
passed
and
the
claimant
might
after
all
have
no
connection
with
the
debarrys
he
might
not
come
on
this
day
or
the
next
there
might
be
more
time
left
for
reflection
and
prayer
all
these
possibilities
which
would
remove
the
pressing
need
for
difficult
action
lyon
represented
to
himself
but
he
had
no
effective
belief
in
them
his
belief
went
with
his
strongest
feeling
and
in
these
moments
his
strongest
feeling
was
dead
he
trembled
under
the
weight
that
seemed
already
added
to
his
own
sin
he
felt
himself
already
confronted
by
annette
husband
and
esther
father
perhaps
the
father
was
a
gentleman
on
a
visit
to
the
debarrys
there
was
no
hindering
the
pang
with
which
the
old
man
said
to
himself
the
child
will
not
be
sorry
to
leave
this
poor
home
and
i
shall
be
guilty
in
her
sight
he
was
walking
about
among
the
rows
of
books
when
there
came
a
loud
rap
at
the
outer
door
the
rap
shook
him
so
that
he
sank
into
his
chair
feeling
almost
powerless
lyddy
presented
herself
here
ever
such
a
fine
man
from
the
manor
wants
to
see
you
sir
dear
heart
dear
heart
shall
i
tell
him
you
too
bad
to
see
him
show
him
up
said
lyon
making
an
effort
to
rally
when
christian
appeared
the
minister
half
rose
leaning
on
an
arm
of
his
chair
and
said
be
seated
sir
seeing
nothing
but
that
a
tall
man
was
entering
i
brought
you
a
letter
from
debarry
said
christian
in
an
manner
the
rusty
little
man
in
his
dismal
chamber
seemed
to
the
ulysses
of
the
steward
room
a
pitiable
sort
of
human
curiosity
to
whom
a
man
of
the
world
would
speak
rather
loudly
in
accommodation
to
an
eccentricity
which
was
likely
to
be
accompanied
with
deafness
one
can
not
be
eminent
in
everything
and
if
christian
had
dispersed
his
faculties
in
study
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
share
unconventional
points
of
view
he
might
have
worn
a
mistaken
kind
of
boot
and
been
less
competent
to
win
at
or
at
betting
or
in
any
other
contest
suitable
to
a
person
of
figure
as
he
seated
himself
lyon
opened
the
letter
and
held
it
close
to
his
eyes
so
that
his
face
was
hidden
but
at
the
word
servant
he
could
not
avoid
starting
and
looking
off
the
letter
toward
the
bearer
christian
knowing
what
was
in
the
letter
conjectured
that
the
old
man
was
amazed
to
learn
that
so
a
personage
was
a
servant
he
leaned
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
balanced
his
cane
on
his
fingers
and
began
a
whispering
whistle
the
minister
checked
himself
finished
the
reading
of
the
letter
and
then
slowly
and
nervously
put
on
his
spectacles
to
survey
this
man
between
whose
fate
and
his
own
there
might
be
a
terrible
collision
the
word
servant
had
been
a
fresh
caution
to
him
he
must
do
nothing
rashly
esther
lot
was
deeply
concerned
here
is
the
seal
mentioned
in
the
letter
said
christian
lyon
drew
the
from
his
desk
and
after
comparing
the
seal
with
the
impression
said
it
is
right
sir
i
deliver
the
to
you
he
held
it
out
with
the
seal
and
christian
rose
to
take
them
saying
carelessly
the
other
things
the
chain
and
the
little
book
are
mine
your
name
then
is
maurice
christian
a
spasm
shot
through
lyon
it
had
seemed
possible
that
he
might
hear
another
name
and
be
freed
from
the
worse
half
of
his
anxiety
his
next
words
were
not
wisely
chosen
but
escaped
him
impulsively
and
you
have
no
other
name
what
do
you
mean
said
christian
sharply
be
so
good
as
to
reseat
yourself
christian
did
not
comply
i
rather
in
a
hurry
sir
he
said
recovering
his
coolness
if
it
suits
you
to
restore
to
me
those
small
articles
of
mine
i
shall
be
glad
but
i
would
rather
leave
them
behind
than
be
detained
he
had
reflected
that
the
minister
was
simply
a
punctilious
old
bore
the
question
meant
nothing
else
but
lyon
had
wrought
himself
up
to
the
task
of
finding
out
then
and
there
if
possible
whether
or
not
this
were
annette
husband
how
could
he
lay
himself
and
his
sin
before
god
if
he
wilfully
declined
to
learn
the
truth
nay
sir
i
will
not
detain
you
unreasonably
he
said
in
a
firmer
tone
than
before
how
long
have
these
articles
been
your
property
oh
for
more
than
twenty
years
said
christian
carelessly
he
was
not
altogether
easy
under
the
minister
persistence
but
for
that
very
reason
he
showed
no
more
impatience
you
have
been
in
france
and
in
germany
i
have
been
in
most
countries
on
the
continent
be
so
good
as
to
write
me
your
name
said
lyon
dipping
a
pen
in
ink
and
holding
it
out
with
a
piece
of
paper
christian
was
much
surprised
but
not
now
greatly
alarmed
in
his
rapid
conjectures
as
to
the
explanation
of
the
minister
curiosity
he
had
alighted
on
one
which
might
carry
advantage
rather
than
inconvenience
but
he
was
not
going
to
commit
himself
before
i
oblige
you
there
sir
he
said
laying
down
the
pen
and
looking
straight
at
lyon
i
must
know
exactly
the
reasons
you
have
for
putting
these
questions
to
me
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
an
excellent
person
i
dare
say
but
i
have
no
concern
about
you
farther
than
to
get
from
you
those
small
articles
do
you
still
doubt
that
they
are
mine
you
wished
i
think
that
i
should
tell
you
what
the
locket
is
like
it
has
a
pair
of
hands
and
blue
flowers
on
one
side
and
the
name
annette
round
the
hair
on
the
other
side
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
if
you
wish
for
anything
more
from
me
you
will
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
why
you
wish
it
now
then
sir
what
is
your
concern
with
me
the
cool
stare
the
hard
challenging
voice
with
which
these
words
were
uttered
made
them
fall
like
the
beating
cutting
chill
of
heavy
hail
on
lyon
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
in
utter
irresolution
and
helplessness
how
was
it
possible
to
lay
bare
the
sad
and
sacred
past
in
answer
to
such
a
call
as
this
the
dread
with
which
he
had
thought
of
this
man
coming
the
suspicion
that
he
was
really
annette
husband
intensified
the
antipathy
created
by
his
gestures
and
glances
the
sensitive
little
minister
knew
instinctively
that
words
which
would
cost
him
efforts
as
painful
as
the
obedient
footsteps
of
a
wounded
bleeding
hound
that
wills
a
foreseen
throe
would
fall
on
this
man
as
the
pressure
of
tender
fingers
falls
on
a
brazen
glove
and
esther
if
this
man
was
her
father
every
additional
word
might
help
to
bring
down
irrevocable
perhaps
cruel
consequences
on
her
a
thick
mist
seemed
to
have
fallen
where
lyon
was
looking
for
the
track
of
duty
the
difficult
question
how
far
he
was
to
care
for
consequences
in
seeking
and
avowing
the
truth
seemed
anew
obscured
all
these
things
like
the
vision
of
a
coming
calamity
were
compressed
into
a
moment
of
consciousness
nothing
could
be
done
everything
must
be
deferred
he
answered
christian
in
a
low
apologetic
tone
it
is
true
sir
you
have
told
me
all
i
can
demand
i
have
no
sufficient
reason
for
detaining
your
property
further
he
handed
the
and
chain
to
christian
who
had
been
observing
him
narrowly
and
now
said
in
a
tone
of
indifference
as
he
pocketed
the
articles
very
good
sir
i
wish
you
a
said
lyon
feeling
while
the
door
closed
behind
his
guest
that
mixture
of
uneasiness
and
relief
which
all
procrastination
of
difficulty
produces
in
minds
capable
of
strong
forecast
the
work
was
still
to
be
done
he
had
still
before
him
the
task
of
learning
everything
that
could
be
learned
about
this
man
relation
to
himself
and
esther
christian
as
he
made
his
way
back
along
malthouse
lane
was
thinking
this
old
fellow
has
got
some
secret
in
his
head
it
not
likely
he
can
know
anything
about
me
it
must
be
about
bycliffe
but
bycliffe
was
a
gentleman
how
should
he
ever
have
had
anything
to
do
with
such
a
seedy
old
ranter
as
that
chapter
xv
and
doubt
shall
be
as
lead
upon
the
feet
of
thy
most
anxious
will
lyon
was
careful
to
look
in
at
felix
as
soon
as
possible
after
christian
departure
to
tell
him
that
his
trust
was
discharged
during
the
rest
of
the
day
he
was
somewhat
relieved
from
agitating
reflections
by
the
necessity
of
attending
to
his
ministerial
duties
the
rebuke
of
rebellious
singers
being
one
of
them
and
on
his
return
from
the
monday
evening
he
was
so
overcome
with
weariness
that
he
went
to
bed
without
taking
note
of
any
objects
in
his
study
but
when
he
rose
the
next
morning
his
mind
once
more
eagerly
active
was
arrested
by
philip
debarry
letter
which
still
lay
open
on
his
desk
and
was
arrested
by
precisely
that
portion
which
had
been
unheeded
the
day
before
shall
consider
myself
doubly
fortunate
if
at
any
time
you
can
point
out
to
me
some
method
by
which
i
may
procure
you
as
lively
a
satisfaction
as
i
am
now
feeling
in
that
full
and
speedy
relief
from
anxiety
which
i
owe
to
your
considerate
to
understand
how
these
words
could
carry
the
suggestion
they
actually
had
for
the
minister
in
a
crisis
of
peculiar
personal
anxiety
and
struggle
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
for
many
years
he
had
walked
through
life
with
the
sense
of
having
for
a
space
been
unfaithful
to
what
he
esteemed
the
highest
trust
ever
committed
to
man
the
ministerial
vocation
in
a
mind
of
any
nobleness
a
lapse
into
transgression
against
an
object
still
regarded
as
supreme
issues
in
a
new
and
purer
devotedness
chastised
by
humility
and
watched
over
by
a
passionate
regret
so
it
was
with
that
ardent
spirit
which
animated
the
little
body
of
rufus
lyon
once
in
his
life
he
had
been
blinded
defeated
hurried
along
by
rebellious
impulse
he
had
gone
astray
after
his
own
desires
and
had
let
the
fire
die
out
on
the
altar
and
as
the
true
penitent
hating
his
error
asks
from
all
coming
life
duty
instead
of
joy
and
service
instead
of
ease
so
rufus
was
perpetually
on
the
watch
lest
he
should
ever
again
postpone
to
some
private
affection
a
great
public
opportunity
which
to
him
was
equivalent
to
a
command
now
here
was
an
opportunity
brought
by
a
combination
of
that
unexpected
incalculable
kind
which
might
be
regarded
as
the
divine
emphasis
invoking
especial
attention
to
trivial
events
an
opportunity
of
securing
what
rufus
lyon
had
often
wished
for
as
a
means
of
honoring
truth
and
exhibiting
error
in
the
character
of
a
stammering
halting
usurper
of
office
and
dignity
what
was
more
exasperating
to
a
zealous
preacher
with
whom
copious
speech
was
not
a
difficulty
but
a
relief
who
never
lacked
argument
but
only
combatants
and
listeners
than
to
reflect
that
there
were
thousands
on
thousands
of
pulpits
in
this
kingdom
supplied
with
handsome
and
occupying
an
advantageous
position
in
buildings
far
larger
than
the
chapel
in
malthouse
yard
buildings
sure
to
be
places
of
resort
even
as
the
markets
were
if
only
from
habit
and
interest
and
that
these
pulpits
were
filled
or
rather
made
vacuous
by
men
whose
privileged
education
in
the
ancient
centres
of
instruction
issued
in
twenty
minutes
formal
reading
of
tepid
exhortation
or
probably
infirm
deductions
from
premises
based
on
rotten
scaffolding
and
it
is
in
the
nature
of
exasperation
gradually
to
concentrate
itself
the
sincere
antipathy
of
a
dog
toward
cats
in
general
necessarily
takes
the
form
of
indignant
barking
at
the
neighbor
black
cat
which
makes
daily
trespass
the
bark
at
imagined
cats
though
a
frequent
exercise
of
the
canine
mind
is
yet
comparatively
feeble
lyon
sarcasm
was
not
without
an
edge
when
he
dilated
in
general
on
an
elaborate
education
for
teachers
which
issued
in
the
minimum
of
teaching
but
it
found
a
whetstone
in
the
particular
example
of
that
bad
system
known
as
the
rector
of
treby
magna
there
was
nothing
positive
to
be
said
against
the
rev
augustus
debarry
his
life
could
not
be
pronounced
blameworthy
except
for
its
negatives
and
the
good
rufus
was
too
not
to
be
glad
of
that
he
had
no
delight
in
vice
as
discrediting
wicked
opponents
he
shrank
from
dwelling
on
the
images
of
cruelty
or
grossness
and
his
indignation
was
habitually
inspired
only
by
those
moral
and
intellectual
mistakes
which
darken
the
soul
but
do
not
injure
or
degrade
the
temple
of
the
body
if
the
rector
had
been
a
less
respectable
man
rufus
would
have
more
reluctantly
made
him
an
object
of
antagonism
but
as
an
incarnation
of
error
dissociated
from
those
baser
sins
which
have
no
good
repute
even
with
the
worldly
it
would
be
an
argumentative
luxury
to
get
into
close
quarters
with
him
and
fight
with
a
dialectic
in
the
eyes
of
the
treby
world
sending
also
a
written
account
thereof
to
the
chief
organs
of
dissenting
opinion
vice
was
essentially
stupid
a
deaf
and
eyeless
monster
insusceptible
to
demonstration
the
spirit
might
work
on
it
by
unseen
ways
and
the
unstudied
sallies
of
sermons
were
often
as
the
arrows
which
pierced
and
awakened
the
brutified
conscience
but
illuminated
thought
finely
divided
speech
were
the
choicer
weapons
of
the
divine
armory
which
whoso
could
wield
must
be
careful
not
to
leave
idle
here
then
was
the
opportunity
here
was
an
engagement
an
expression
of
a
strong
wish
on
the
part
of
philip
debarry
if
it
were
in
his
power
to
procure
a
satisfaction
to
rufus
lyon
how
had
that
man
of
god
and
exemplary
independent
minister
ainsworth
of
persecuted
sanctity
conducted
himself
when
a
similar
occasion
had
befallen
him
at
amsterdam
he
had
thought
of
nothing
but
the
glory
of
the
highest
cause
and
had
converted
the
offer
of
recompense
into
a
public
debate
with
a
jew
on
the
chief
mysteries
of
the
faith
here
was
a
model
the
case
was
nothing
short
of
a
heavenly
indication
and
he
rufus
lyon
would
seize
the
occasion
to
demand
a
public
debate
with
the
rector
on
the
constitution
of
the
true
church
what
if
he
were
inwardly
torn
by
doubt
and
anxiety
concerning
his
own
private
relations
and
the
facts
of
his
past
life
that
danger
of
absorption
within
the
narrow
bounds
of
self
only
urged
him
the
more
toward
action
which
had
a
wider
bearing
and
might
tell
on
the
welfare
of
england
at
large
it
was
decided
before
the
minister
went
down
to
breakfast
that
morning
he
had
written
the
following
letter
to
philip
debarry
sir
referring
to
your
letter
of
yesterday
i
find
the
following
words
i
shall
consider
myself
doubly
fortunate
if
at
any
time
you
can
point
out
to
me
some
method
by
which
i
may
procure
you
as
lively
a
satisfaction
as
i
am
now
feeling
in
that
full
and
speedy
relief
from
anxiety
which
i
owe
to
your
considerate
conduct
i
am
not
unaware
sir
that
in
the
usage
of
the
world
there
are
words
of
courtesy
so
called
which
are
understood
by
those
amongst
whom
they
are
current
to
have
no
precise
meaning
and
to
constitute
no
bond
of
obligation
i
will
not
now
insist
that
this
is
an
abuse
of
language
wherein
our
fallible
nature
requires
the
strictest
safeguards
against
laxity
and
misapplication
for
i
do
not
apprehend
that
in
writing
the
words
i
have
above
quoted
you
were
open
to
the
reproach
of
using
phrases
which
while
seeming
to
carry
a
specific
meaning
were
really
no
more
than
what
is
called
a
polite
form
i
believe
sir
that
you
used
these
words
advisedly
sincerely
and
with
an
honorable
intention
of
acting
on
them
as
a
pledge
should
such
action
be
demanded
no
other
supposition
on
my
part
would
correspond
to
the
character
you
bear
as
a
young
man
who
aspires
albeit
mistakenly
to
engraft
the
finest
fruits
of
public
virtue
on
a
creed
and
institutions
whereof
the
sap
is
composed
rather
of
human
than
of
everlasting
truth
wherefore
i
act
on
this
my
belief
in
the
integrity
of
your
written
word
i
beg
you
to
procure
for
me
as
it
is
doubtless
in
your
power
that
i
may
be
allowed
a
public
discussion
with
your
near
relative
the
rector
of
this
parish
the
reverend
augustus
debarry
to
be
held
in
the
large
room
of
the
free
school
or
in
the
assembly
room
of
the
marquis
of
granby
these
being
the
largest
covered
spaces
at
our
command
for
i
presume
he
would
neither
allow
me
to
speak
within
his
church
nor
would
consent
himself
to
speak
within
my
chapel
and
the
probable
inclemency
of
the
approaching
season
forbids
an
assured
expectation
that
we
could
discourse
in
the
open
air
the
subjects
i
desire
to
discuss
are
first
the
constitution
of
the
true
church
and
secondly
the
bearing
thereupon
of
the
english
reformation
confidently
expecting
that
you
will
comply
with
this
request
which
is
the
sequence
of
your
expressed
desire
i
remain
sir
yours
with
the
respect
offered
to
a
sincere
withstander
rufus
lyon
malthouse
yard
after
writing
this
letter
the
good
rufus
felt
that
serenity
and
elevation
of
mind
which
is
infallibly
brought
by
a
preoccupation
with
the
wider
relations
of
things
already
he
was
beginning
to
sketch
the
course
his
argument
might
most
judiciously
take
in
the
coming
debate
his
thoughts
were
running
into
sentences
and
marking
off
careful
exceptions
in
parentheses
and
he
had
come
down
and
seated
himself
at
the
quite
automatically
without
expectation
of
toast
or
coffee
when
esther
voice
and
touch
recalled
to
him
an
inward
debate
of
another
kind
in
which
he
felt
himself
much
weaker
again
there
arose
before
him
the
image
of
that
cool
worldly
man
who
might
be
this
dear
child
father
and
one
against
whose
rights
he
had
himself
grievously
offended
always
as
the
image
recurred
to
him
heart
sent
forth
a
prayer
for
guidance
but
no
definite
guidance
had
yet
made
itself
visible
for
him
it
could
not
be
guidance
it
was
a
temptation
that
said
let
the
matter
rest
seek
to
know
no
more
know
only
what
is
thrust
upon
you
the
remembrance
that
in
his
time
of
wandering
he
had
wilfully
remained
in
ignorance
of
facts
which
he
might
have
enquired
after
deepened
the
impression
that
it
was
now
an
imperative
duty
to
seek
the
fullest
attainable
knowledge
and
the
enquiry
might
possibly
issue
in
a
blessed
repose
by
putting
a
negative
on
all
his
suspicions
but
the
more
vividly
all
the
circumstances
became
present
to
him
the
more
unfit
he
felt
himself
to
set
about
any
investigation
concerning
this
man
who
called
himself
maurice
christian
he
could
seek
no
confidant
or
helper
among
the
brethren
he
was
obliged
to
admit
to
himself
that
the
members
of
his
church
with
whom
he
hoped
to
go
to
heaven
were
not
easy
to
converse
with
on
earth
touching
the
deeper
secrets
of
his
experience
and
were
still
less
able
to
advise
him
as
to
the
wisest
procedure
in
a
case
of
high
delicacy
with
a
worldling
who
had
a
whisker
and
a
fashionable
costume
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
occurred
to
the
minister
that
he
should
be
glad
of
an
adviser
who
had
more
worldly
than
spiritual
experience
and
that
it
might
not
be
inconsistent
with
his
principles
to
seek
some
light
from
one
who
had
studied
human
law
but
it
was
a
thought
to
be
paused
upon
and
not
followed
out
rashly
some
other
guidance
might
intervene
esther
noticed
that
her
father
was
in
a
fit
of
abstraction
that
he
seemed
to
swallow
his
coffee
and
toast
quite
unconsciously
and
that
he
vented
from
time
to
time
a
low
guttural
interjection
which
was
habitual
with
him
when
he
was
absorbed
by
an
inward
discussion
she
did
not
disturb
him
by
remarks
and
only
wondered
whether
anything
unusual
had
occurred
on
sunday
evening
but
at
last
she
thought
it
needful
to
say
you
recollect
what
i
told
you
yesterday
father
nay
child
what
said
lyon
rousing
himself
that
jermyn
asked
me
if
you
would
probably
be
at
home
this
morning
before
one
esther
was
surprised
to
see
her
father
start
and
change
color
as
if
he
had
been
shaken
by
some
sudden
collision
before
he
answered
assuredly
i
do
not
intend
to
move
from
my
study
after
i
have
once
been
out
to
hand
this
letter
to
zachary
shall
i
tell
lyddy
to
take
him
up
at
once
to
your
study
if
he
comes
if
not
i
shall
have
to
stay
in
my
own
room
because
i
shall
be
at
home
all
this
morning
and
it
is
rather
cold
now
to
sit
without
a
fire
yes
my
dear
let
him
come
up
to
me
unless
indeed
he
should
bring
a
second
person
which
might
happen
seeing
that
in
all
likelihood
he
is
coming
as
hitherto
on
electioneering
business
and
i
could
not
well
accommodate
two
visitors
when
lyon
went
out
to
zachary
the
to
give
him
a
second
time
the
commission
of
carrying
a
letter
to
treby
manor
esther
gave
her
injunction
to
lyddy
that
if
one
gentleman
came
he
was
to
be
shown
if
two
they
were
to
be
shown
into
the
parlor
but
she
had
to
resolve
several
questions
before
lyddy
clearly
saw
what
was
before
her
as
that
if
it
was
the
gentleman
as
came
on
thursday
in
the
coat
was
he
to
be
shown
and
the
gentleman
from
the
manor
yesterday
as
went
out
whistling
had
miss
esther
heard
about
him
there
seemed
no
end
of
these
great
folks
coming
to
malthouse
yard
since
there
was
talk
of
the
election
but
they
might
be
poor
lost
creatures
the
most
of
whereupon
lyddy
shook
her
head
and
groaned
under
an
edifying
despair
as
to
the
future
lot
of
gentlemen
callers
esther
always
avoided
asking
questions
of
lyddy
who
found
an
answer
as
she
found
a
key
by
pouring
out
a
pocketful
of
miscellanies
but
she
had
remarked
so
many
indications
that
something
had
happened
to
cause
her
father
unusual
excitement
and
mental
preoccupation
that
she
could
not
help
connecting
with
them
the
fact
of
this
visit
from
the
manor
which
he
had
not
mentioned
to
her
she
sat
down
in
the
dull
parlor
and
took
up
her
netting
for
since
sunday
she
had
felt
unable
to
read
when
she
was
alone
being
obliged
in
spite
of
herself
to
think
of
felix
holt
to
imagine
what
he
would
like
her
to
be
and
what
sort
of
views
he
took
of
life
so
as
to
make
it
seem
valuable
in
the
absence
of
all
elegance
luxury
gayety
or
romance
had
he
yet
reflected
that
he
had
behaved
very
rudely
to
her
on
sunday
perhaps
not
perhaps
he
had
dismissed
her
from
his
mind
with
contempt
and
at
that
thought
esther
eyes
smarted
unpleasantly
she
was
fond
of
netting
because
it
showed
to
advantage
both
her
hand
and
her
foot
and
across
this
image
of
felix
holt
indifference
and
contempt
there
passed
the
vaguer
image
of
a
possible
somebody
who
would
admire
her
hands
and
feet
and
delight
in
looking
at
their
beauty
and
long
yet
not
dare
to
kiss
them
life
would
be
much
easier
in
the
presence
of
such
a
love
but
it
was
precisely
this
longing
after
her
own
satisfaction
that
felix
had
reproached
her
with
did
he
want
her
to
be
heroic
that
seemed
impossible
without
some
great
occasion
her
life
was
a
heap
of
fragments
and
so
were
her
thoughts
some
great
energy
was
needed
to
bind
them
together
esther
was
beginning
to
lose
her
complacency
at
her
own
wit
and
criticism
to
lose
the
sense
of
superiority
in
an
awakening
need
of
reliance
on
one
whose
vision
was
wider
whose
nature
was
purer
and
stronger
than
her
own
but
then
she
said
to
herself
that
one
must
be
tender
to
her
not
rude
and
predominating
in
his
manners
a
man
with
any
chivalry
in
him
could
never
adopt
a
scolding
tone
toward
a
woman
that
is
toward
a
charming
woman
but
felix
had
no
chivalry
in
him
he
loved
lecturing
and
opinion
too
well
ever
to
love
any
woman
in
this
way
esther
strove
to
see
that
felix
was
thoroughly
in
the
wrong
at
least
if
he
did
not
come
again
expressly
to
show
that
he
was
sorry
chapter
xvi
these
men
have
no
votes
why
should
i
court
them
no
votes
but
power
what
over
charities
no
over
brains
which
disturbs
the
canvass
in
a
natural
state
of
things
the
average
price
of
a
vote
at
paddlebrook
is
throwing
the
fifty
pound
tenants
who
cost
nothing
into
the
divisor
but
these
talking
men
cause
an
artificial
rise
of
prices
the
expected
important
knock
at
the
door
came
about
twelve
and
esther
could
hear
that
there
were
two
visitors
immediately
the
parlor
door
was
opened
and
the
cravatless
image
of
felix
holt
which
was
just
then
full
in
the
mirror
of
esther
mind
was
displaced
by
the
appearance
of
a
personage
whose
name
she
guessed
before
jermyn
had
announced
it
the
perfect
morning
costume
of
that
day
differed
much
from
our
present
ideal
it
was
essential
that
a
gentleman
chin
should
be
well
propped
that
his
collar
should
have
a
voluminous
roll
that
his
waistcoat
should
imply
much
discrimination
and
that
his
buttons
should
be
arranged
in
a
manner
which
would
now
expose
him
to
general
contempt
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
at
the
distant
period
when
treby
magna
first
knew
the
excitements
of
an
election
there
existed
many
other
anomalies
now
obsolete
besides
coats
and
broad
stiffeners
but
we
have
some
notions
of
beauty
and
fitness
which
withstand
the
centuries
and
quite
irrespective
of
dates
it
would
be
pronounced
that
at
the
age
of
harold
transome
was
a
striking
and
handsome
man
he
was
one
of
those
people
as
denner
remarked
to
whose
presence
in
the
room
you
could
not
be
indifferent
if
you
do
not
hate
or
dread
them
you
must
find
the
touch
of
their
hands
nay
their
very
shadows
agreeable
esther
felt
a
pleasure
quite
new
to
her
as
she
saw
his
face
and
full
bright
eyes
turned
toward
her
with
an
air
of
deference
by
which
gallantry
must
commend
itself
to
a
refined
woman
who
is
not
absolutely
free
from
vanity
harold
transome
regarded
women
as
slight
things
but
he
was
fond
of
slight
things
in
the
intervals
of
business
and
he
held
it
among
the
chief
arts
of
life
to
keep
these
pleasant
diversions
within
such
bounds
that
they
should
never
interfere
with
the
course
of
his
serious
ambition
esther
was
perfectly
aware
as
he
took
a
chair
near
her
that
he
was
under
some
admiring
surprise
at
her
appearance
and
manner
how
could
it
be
otherwise
she
believed
that
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
no
young
lady
in
treby
could
equal
her
she
felt
a
glow
of
delight
at
the
sense
that
she
was
being
looked
at
my
father
expected
you
she
said
to
jermyn
i
delivered
your
letter
to
him
yesterday
he
will
be
down
immediately
she
disentangled
her
foot
from
her
netting
and
wound
it
up
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
let
us
disturb
you
said
harold
noticing
her
action
we
come
to
discuss
election
affairs
and
we
particularly
desire
to
interest
the
ladies
i
have
no
interest
with
any
one
who
is
not
already
on
the
right
side
said
esther
smiling
i
am
happy
to
see
at
least
that
you
wear
the
liberal
colors
i
fear
i
must
confess
that
it
is
more
from
love
of
blue
than
from
love
of
liberalism
yellow
opinions
could
only
have
brunettes
on
their
side
esther
spoke
with
her
usual
pretty
fluency
but
she
had
no
sooner
uttered
the
words
than
she
thought
how
angry
they
would
have
made
felix
if
my
cause
is
to
be
recommended
by
the
becomingness
of
my
colors
then
i
am
sure
you
are
acting
in
my
interest
by
wearing
them
esther
rose
to
leave
the
room
must
you
really
go
said
harold
preparing
to
open
the
door
for
her
yes
i
have
an
engagement
a
lesson
at
half
past
twelve
said
esther
bowing
and
floating
out
like
a
naïad
but
not
without
a
suffused
blush
as
she
passed
through
the
doorway
it
was
a
pity
the
room
was
so
small
harold
transome
thought
this
girl
ought
to
walk
in
a
house
where
there
were
halls
and
corridors
but
he
had
soon
dismissed
this
chance
preoccupation
with
esther
for
before
the
door
was
closed
again
lyon
had
entered
and
harold
was
entirely
bent
on
what
had
been
the
object
of
his
visit
the
minister
though
no
elector
himself
had
considerable
influence
over
liberal
electors
and
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
in
a
candidate
to
cement
all
political
adhesion
by
a
little
personal
regard
if
possible
garstin
was
a
harsh
and
wiry
fellow
he
seemed
to
suggest
that
sour
whey
which
some
say
was
the
original
meaning
of
whig
in
the
scottish
and
it
might
suggest
the
theoretic
advantages
of
radicalism
if
it
could
be
associated
with
a
more
generous
presence
what
would
conciliate
the
personal
regard
of
old
lyon
became
a
curious
problem
to
harold
now
the
little
man
made
his
appearance
but
canvassing
makes
a
gentleman
acquainted
with
many
strange
animals
together
with
the
ways
of
catching
and
taming
them
and
thus
the
knowledge
of
natural
history
advances
amongst
the
aristocracy
and
wealthy
commoners
of
our
land
i
am
very
glad
to
have
secured
this
opportunity
of
making
your
personal
acquaintance
lyon
said
harold
putting
out
his
hand
to
the
minister
when
jermyn
had
mentioned
his
name
i
am
to
address
the
electors
here
in
the
and
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
do
so
without
first
paying
my
respects
privately
to
my
chief
friends
as
there
may
be
points
on
which
they
particularly
wish
me
to
explain
myself
you
speak
civilly
sir
and
reasonably
said
lyon
with
a
vague
gaze
in
which
a
candidate
appearance
evidently
went
for
nothing
pray
be
seated
gentlemen
it
is
my
habit
to
stand
he
placed
himself
at
a
right
angle
with
his
visitors
his
worn
look
of
intellectual
eagerness
slight
frame
and
rusty
attire
making
an
odd
contrast
with
their
flourishing
persons
unblemished
costume
and
comfortable
freedom
from
excitement
the
group
was
fairly
typical
of
the
difference
between
the
men
who
are
animated
by
ideas
and
the
men
who
are
expected
to
apply
them
then
he
drew
forth
his
spectacles
and
began
to
rub
them
with
the
thin
end
of
his
coat
tail
he
was
inwardly
exercising
great
suppressing
the
thought
of
his
personal
needs
which
jermyn
presence
tended
to
suggest
in
order
that
he
might
be
equal
to
the
larger
duties
of
this
occasion
i
am
aware
jermyn
has
told
me
said
harold
what
good
service
you
have
done
me
already
lyon
the
fact
is
a
man
of
intellect
like
you
was
especially
needed
in
my
case
the
race
i
am
running
is
really
against
garstin
only
who
calls
himself
a
liberal
though
he
cares
for
nothing
and
understands
nothing
except
the
interests
of
the
wealthy
traders
and
you
have
been
able
to
explain
the
difference
between
liberal
and
liberal
which
as
you
and
i
know
is
something
like
the
difference
between
fish
and
fish
your
comparison
is
not
unapt
sir
said
lyon
still
holding
his
spectacles
in
his
hand
at
this
epoch
when
the
mind
of
the
nation
has
been
strained
on
the
passing
of
one
measure
where
a
great
weight
has
to
be
moved
we
require
not
so
much
selected
instruments
as
abundant
but
it
is
an
unavoidable
evil
of
these
massive
achievements
that
they
encourage
a
coarse
undiscriminatingness
obstructive
of
more
results
and
an
exaggerated
expectation
inconsistent
with
the
intricacies
of
our
fallen
and
struggling
condition
i
say
not
that
compromise
is
unnecessary
but
it
is
an
evil
attendant
on
our
imperfection
and
i
would
pray
every
one
to
mark
that
where
compromise
broadens
intellect
and
conscience
are
thrust
into
narrower
room
wherefore
it
has
been
my
object
to
show
our
people
that
there
are
many
who
have
helped
to
draw
the
car
of
reform
whose
ends
are
but
partial
and
who
forsake
not
the
ungodly
principle
of
selfish
alliances
but
would
only
substitute
syria
for
egypt
thinking
chiefly
of
their
own
share
in
peacocks
gold
and
ivory
just
so
said
harold
who
was
quick
at
new
languages
and
still
quicker
at
translating
other
men
generalities
into
his
own
special
and
immediate
purposes
men
who
will
be
satisfied
if
they
can
only
bring
in
a
plutocracy
buy
up
the
land
and
stick
the
old
crests
on
their
new
gateways
now
the
practical
point
to
secure
against
these
false
liberals
at
present
is
that
our
electors
should
not
divide
their
votes
as
it
appears
that
many
who
vote
for
debarry
are
likely
to
split
their
votes
in
favor
of
garstin
it
is
of
the
first
consequence
that
my
voters
should
give
me
plumpers
if
they
divide
their
votes
they
ca
keep
out
debarry
and
they
may
help
to
keep
out
me
i
feel
some
confidence
in
asking
you
to
use
your
influence
in
this
direction
lyon
we
candidates
have
to
praise
ourselves
more
than
is
graceful
but
you
are
aware
that
while
i
belong
by
my
birth
to
the
classes
that
have
their
roots
in
tradition
and
all
the
old
loyalties
my
experience
has
lain
chiefly
among
those
who
make
their
own
career
and
depend
on
the
new
rather
than
the
old
i
have
had
the
advantage
of
considering
the
national
welfare
under
varied
lights
i
have
wider
views
than
those
of
a
mere
cotton
lord
on
questions
connected
with
religious
liberty
i
would
stop
short
at
no
measure
that
was
not
thorough
i
hope
not
sir
i
hope
not
said
lyon
gravely
finally
putting
on
his
spectacles
and
examining
the
face
of
the
candidate
whom
he
was
preparing
to
turn
into
a
catechumen
for
the
good
rufus
conscious
of
his
political
importance
as
an
organ
of
persuasion
felt
it
his
duty
to
catechise
a
little
and
also
to
do
his
part
toward
impressing
a
probable
legislator
with
a
sense
of
his
responsibility
but
the
latter
branch
of
duty
somewhat
obstructed
the
catechising
for
his
mind
was
so
urged
by
considerations
which
he
held
in
danger
of
being
overlooked
that
the
questions
and
answers
bore
a
very
slender
proportion
to
his
exposition
it
was
impossible
to
leave
the
question
of
without
noting
the
grounds
of
their
injustice
and
without
a
brief
enumeration
of
reasons
why
lyon
for
his
own
part
would
not
present
that
passive
resistance
to
a
legal
imposition
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
friends
whose
heroism
in
this
regard
was
nevertheless
worthy
of
all
honor
comprehensive
talkers
are
apt
to
be
tiresome
when
we
are
not
athirst
for
information
but
to
be
quite
fair
we
must
admit
that
superior
reticence
is
a
good
deal
due
to
the
lack
of
matter
speech
is
often
barren
but
silence
also
does
not
necessarily
brood
over
a
full
nest
your
still
fowl
blinking
at
you
without
remark
may
all
the
while
be
sitting
on
one
addled
and
when
it
takes
to
cackling
will
have
nothing
to
announce
but
that
addled
delusion
harold
transome
was
not
at
all
a
patient
man
but
in
matters
of
business
he
was
quite
awake
to
his
cue
and
in
this
case
it
was
perhaps
easier
to
listen
than
to
answer
questions
but
jermyn
who
had
plenty
of
work
on
his
hands
took
an
opportunity
of
rising
and
saying
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
must
really
be
at
the
office
in
five
minutes
you
will
find
me
there
transome
you
have
probably
still
many
things
to
say
to
mr
lyon
i
beseech
you
sir
said
the
minister
changing
color
and
by
a
quick
movement
laying
his
hand
on
jermyn
arm
i
beseech
you
to
favor
me
with
an
interview
on
some
private
business
this
evening
if
it
were
possible
lyon
like
others
who
are
habitually
occupied
with
impersonal
subjects
was
liable
to
this
impulsive
sort
of
action
he
snatched
at
the
details
of
life
as
if
they
were
darting
past
him
as
if
they
were
like
the
ribbons
at
his
knees
which
would
never
be
tied
all
day
if
they
were
not
tied
on
the
instant
through
these
spasmodic
leaps
out
of
his
abstractions
into
real
life
it
constantly
happened
that
he
suddenly
took
a
course
which
had
been
the
subject
of
too
much
doubt
with
him
ever
to
have
been
determined
on
by
continuous
thought
and
if
jermyn
had
not
startled
him
by
threatening
to
vanish
just
when
he
was
plunged
in
politics
he
might
never
have
made
up
his
mind
to
confide
in
a
worldly
attorney
an
odd
man
as
muscat
observed
to
have
such
a
gift
in
the
pulpit
but
there
one
knows
better
than
we
do
which
in
a
lady
who
rarely
felt
her
judgment
at
a
loss
was
a
concession
that
showed
much
piety
jermyn
was
surprised
at
the
little
man
eagerness
by
all
means
he
answered
quite
cordially
could
you
come
to
my
office
at
eight
for
several
reasons
i
must
beg
you
to
come
to
me
oh
very
good
i
walk
out
and
see
you
this
evening
if
possible
i
shall
have
much
pleasure
in
being
of
any
use
to
you
jermyn
felt
that
in
the
eyes
of
harold
he
was
appearing
all
the
more
valuable
when
his
services
were
thus
in
request
he
went
out
and
lyon
easily
relapsed
into
politics
for
he
had
been
on
the
brink
of
a
favorite
subject
on
which
he
was
at
issue
with
his
at
that
time
when
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
political
change
was
at
in
ardent
reformers
many
measures
which
men
are
still
discussing
with
little
confidence
on
either
side
were
then
talked
about
and
disposed
of
like
property
in
near
reversion
crying
abuses
bloated
paupers
bloated
pluralists
and
other
corruptions
hindering
men
from
being
wise
and
happy
had
to
be
fought
against
and
slain
such
a
time
is
a
time
of
hope
afterward
when
the
corpses
of
those
monsters
have
been
held
up
to
the
public
wonder
and
abhorrence
and
yet
wisdom
and
happiness
do
not
follow
but
rather
a
more
abundant
breeding
of
the
foolish
and
unhappy
comes
a
time
of
doubt
and
despondency
but
in
the
great
hope
was
mighty
the
prospect
of
reform
had
even
served
the
voters
instead
of
drink
and
in
one
place
at
least
there
had
been
a
dry
election
and
now
the
speakers
at
reform
banquets
were
exuberant
in
congratulation
and
promise
liberal
clergymen
of
the
establishment
toasted
liberal
catholic
clergymen
without
any
allusion
to
scarlet
and
catholic
clergymen
replied
with
a
like
tender
reserve
some
dwelt
on
the
abolition
of
all
abuses
and
on
millennial
blessedness
generally
others
whose
imaginations
were
less
suffused
with
exhalations
of
the
dawn
insisted
chiefly
on
the
now
on
this
question
of
the
ballot
the
minister
strongly
took
the
negative
side
our
pet
opinions
are
usually
those
which
place
us
in
a
minority
of
a
minority
amongst
our
own
party
very
happily
else
those
poor
opinions
born
with
no
silver
spoon
in
their
mouths
how
would
they
get
nourished
and
fed
so
it
was
with
lyon
and
his
objection
to
the
ballot
but
he
had
thrown
out
a
remark
on
the
subject
which
was
not
quite
clear
to
his
hearer
who
interpreted
it
according
to
his
best
calculation
of
probabilities
i
have
no
objection
to
the
ballot
said
harold
but
i
think
that
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
we
have
to
work
at
just
now
we
should
get
it
and
other
questions
are
imminent
then
sir
you
would
vote
for
the
ballot
said
lyon
stroking
his
chin
certainly
if
the
point
came
up
i
have
too
much
respect
for
the
freedom
of
the
voter
to
oppose
anything
which
offers
a
chance
of
making
that
freedom
more
complete
lyon
looked
at
the
speaker
with
a
pitying
smile
and
a
subdued
h
m
m
which
harold
took
for
a
sign
of
satisfaction
he
was
soon
undeceived
you
grieve
me
sir
you
grieve
me
much
and
i
pray
you
to
reconsider
this
question
for
it
will
take
you
to
the
root
as
i
think
of
political
morality
i
engage
to
show
to
any
impartial
mind
duly
furnished
with
the
principles
of
public
and
private
rectitude
that
the
ballot
would
be
pernicious
and
that
if
it
were
not
pernicious
it
would
still
be
futile
i
will
show
first
that
it
would
be
futile
as
a
preservative
from
bribery
and
illegitimate
influence
and
secondly
that
it
would
be
in
the
worst
kind
pernicious
as
shutting
the
door
against
those
influences
whereby
the
soul
of
a
man
and
the
character
of
a
citizen
are
duly
educated
for
their
great
functions
be
not
alarmed
if
i
detain
you
sir
it
is
well
worth
the
while
confound
this
old
man
thought
harold
i
never
make
a
canvassing
call
on
a
preacher
again
unless
he
has
lost
his
voice
from
a
cold
he
was
going
to
excuse
himself
as
prudently
as
he
could
by
deferring
the
subject
till
the
morrow
and
inviting
lyon
to
come
to
him
in
the
before
the
time
appointed
for
his
public
speech
but
he
was
relieved
by
the
opening
of
the
door
lyddy
put
in
her
head
to
say
if
you
please
sir
here
holt
wants
to
know
if
he
may
come
in
and
speak
to
the
gentleman
he
begs
your
pardon
but
you
to
say
if
you
do
like
him
to
come
nay
show
him
in
at
once
lyddy
a
young
man
lyon
went
on
speaking
to
harold
whom
a
representative
ought
to
know
no
voter
but
a
man
of
ideas
and
study
he
is
thoroughly
welcome
said
harold
truthfully
enough
though
he
felt
little
interest
in
the
voteless
man
of
ideas
except
as
a
diversion
from
the
subject
of
the
ballot
he
had
been
standing
for
the
last
minute
or
two
feeling
less
of
a
victim
in
that
attitude
and
more
able
to
calculate
on
means
of
escape
holt
sir
said
the
minister
as
felix
entered
is
a
young
friend
of
mine
whose
opinions
on
some
points
i
hope
to
see
altered
but
who
has
a
zeal
for
public
justice
which
i
trust
he
will
never
lose
i
am
glad
to
see
holt
said
harold
bowing
he
perceived
from
the
way
in
which
felix
bowed
to
him
and
turned
to
the
most
distant
spot
in
the
room
that
the
candidate
shake
of
the
hand
would
not
be
welcome
here
a
formidable
fellow
he
thought
capable
of
mounting
a
cart
in
the
and
me
if
i
say
anything
that
does
please
him
lyon
said
felix
i
have
taken
a
liberty
with
you
in
asking
to
see
transome
when
he
is
engaged
with
you
but
i
have
to
speak
to
him
on
a
matter
which
i
should
care
to
make
public
at
present
and
it
is
one
on
which
i
am
sure
you
will
back
me
i
heard
that
transome
was
here
so
i
ventured
to
come
i
hope
you
will
both
excuse
me
as
my
business
refers
to
some
electioneering
measures
which
are
being
taken
by
transome
agents
pray
go
on
said
harold
expecting
something
unpleasant
i
not
going
to
speak
against
treating
voters
said
felix
i
suppose
buttered
ale
and
grease
of
that
sort
to
make
the
wheels
go
belong
to
the
necessary
humbug
of
representation
but
i
wish
to
ask
you
transome
whether
it
is
with
your
knowledge
that
agents
of
yours
are
bribing
rough
fellows
who
are
no
voters
the
colliers
and
navvies
at
sproxton
with
the
chance
of
extra
drunkenness
that
they
may
make
a
posse
on
your
side
at
the
nomination
and
polling
certainly
not
said
harold
you
are
aware
my
dear
sir
that
a
candidate
is
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
his
agents
as
to
the
means
by
which
he
is
returned
especially
when
many
years
absence
has
made
him
a
stranger
to
the
men
actually
conducting
business
but
are
you
sure
of
your
facts
as
sure
as
my
senses
can
make
me
said
felix
who
then
briefly
described
what
had
happened
on
sunday
i
believed
that
you
were
ignorant
of
all
this
transome
he
ended
and
that
was
why
i
thought
some
good
might
be
done
by
speaking
to
you
if
not
i
should
be
tempted
to
expose
the
whole
affair
as
a
disgrace
to
the
radical
party
i
a
radical
myself
and
mean
to
work
all
my
life
long
against
privilege
monopoly
and
oppression
but
i
would
rather
be
a
proud
of
my
master
title
than
i
would
seem
to
make
common
cause
with
scoundrels
who
turn
the
best
hopes
of
men
into
for
cant
and
dishonesty
your
energetic
protest
is
needless
here
sir
said
harold
offended
at
what
sounded
like
a
threat
and
was
certainly
premature
enough
to
be
in
bad
taste
in
fact
this
error
of
behavior
in
felix
proceeded
from
a
repulsion
which
was
mutual
it
was
a
constant
source
of
irritation
to
him
that
the
public
men
on
his
side
were
on
the
whole
not
conspicuously
better
than
the
public
men
on
the
other
side
that
the
spirit
of
innovation
which
with
him
was
a
part
of
religion
was
in
many
of
its
mouthpieces
no
more
of
a
religion
than
the
faith
in
rotten
boroughs
and
he
was
thus
predisposed
to
distrust
harold
transome
harold
in
his
turn
disliked
impracticable
notions
of
loftiness
and
purity
disliked
all
enthusiasm
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
very
troublesome
vigorous
incorporation
of
that
nonsense
in
felix
but
it
would
be
foolish
to
exasperate
him
in
any
way
if
you
choose
to
accompany
me
to
jermyn
office
he
went
on
the
matter
shall
be
enquired
into
in
your
presence
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
lyon
that
this
will
be
the
most
satisfactory
course
doubtless
said
the
minister
who
liked
the
candidate
very
well
and
believed
that
he
would
be
amenable
to
argument
and
i
would
caution
my
young
friend
against
a
too
great
hastiness
of
words
and
action
cause
against
saul
was
a
righteous
one
nevertheless
not
all
who
clave
unto
david
were
righteous
men
the
more
was
the
pity
sir
said
felix
especially
if
he
winked
at
their
malpractices
lyon
smiled
shook
his
head
and
stroked
his
favorite
arm
deprecatingly
it
is
rather
too
much
for
any
man
to
keep
the
consciences
of
all
his
party
said
harold
if
you
had
lived
in
the
east
as
i
have
you
would
be
more
tolerant
for
example
of
an
active
industrious
selfishness
such
as
we
have
here
though
it
may
not
always
be
quite
scrupulous
you
would
see
how
much
better
it
is
than
an
idle
selfishness
i
have
heard
it
said
a
bridge
is
a
good
thing
worth
helping
to
make
though
half
the
men
who
worked
at
it
were
rogues
oh
yes
said
felix
scornfully
give
me
a
handful
of
generalities
and
analogies
and
i
undertake
to
justify
burke
and
hare
and
prove
them
benefactors
of
their
species
i
tolerate
no
nuisances
but
such
as
i
ca
help
and
the
question
now
is
not
whether
we
can
do
away
with
all
the
nuisances
in
the
world
but
with
a
particular
nuisance
under
our
noses
then
we
had
better
cut
the
matter
short
as
i
propose
by
going
at
once
to
jermyn
said
harold
in
that
case
i
must
bid
you
mr
lyon
i
would
fain
said
the
minister
looking
uneasy
i
would
fain
have
had
a
further
opportunity
of
considering
that
question
of
the
ballot
with
you
the
reasons
against
it
need
not
be
urged
lengthily
they
only
require
complete
enumeration
to
prevent
any
seeming
hiatus
where
an
opposing
fallacy
might
trust
itself
in
never
fear
sir
said
harold
shaking
lyon
hand
cordially
there
will
be
opportunities
shall
i
not
see
you
in
the
i
think
not
said
lyon
rubbing
his
brow
with
a
sad
remembrance
of
his
personal
anxieties
but
i
will
send
you
if
you
will
permit
me
a
brief
writing
on
which
you
can
meditate
at
your
leisure
i
shall
be
delighted
harold
and
felix
went
out
together
and
the
minister
going
up
to
his
dull
study
asked
himself
whether
under
the
pressure
of
conflicting
experience
he
had
faithfully
discharged
the
duties
of
the
past
interview
if
a
cynical
sprite
were
present
riding
on
one
of
the
motes
in
that
dusty
room
he
may
have
made
himself
merry
at
the
illusions
of
the
little
minister
who
brought
so
much
conscience
on
the
production
of
so
slight
an
effect
i
confess
to
smiling
myself
being
sceptical
as
to
the
effect
of
ardent
appeals
and
nice
distinctions
on
gentlemen
who
are
got
up
both
inside
and
out
as
candidates
in
the
style
of
the
period
but
i
never
smiled
at
lyon
trustful
energy
without
falling
to
penitence
and
veneration
immediately
after
for
what
we
call
illusions
are
often
in
truth
a
wider
vision
of
past
and
recent
realities
a
willing
movement
of
a
man
soul
with
the
larger
sweep
of
the
world
forces
a
movement
toward
a
more
assured
end
than
the
chances
of
a
single
life
we
see
human
heroism
broken
into
units
and
say
this
unit
did
little
might
as
well
not
have
been
but
in
this
way
we
might
break
up
a
great
army
into
units
in
this
way
we
might
break
the
sunlight
into
fragments
and
think
that
this
and
the
other
might
be
cheaply
parted
with
let
us
rather
raise
a
monument
to
the
soldiers
whose
brave
hearts
only
kept
the
ranks
unbroken
and
met
death
a
monument
to
the
faithful
who
were
not
famous
and
who
are
precious
as
the
continuity
of
the
sunbeams
is
precious
though
some
of
them
fall
unseen
and
on
barrenness
at
present
looking
back
on
that
day
at
treby
it
seem
to
me
that
the
sadder
illusion
lay
with
harold
transome
who
was
trusting
in
his
own
skill
to
shape
the
success
of
his
own
morrows
ignorant
of
what
many
yesterdays
had
determined
for
him
beforehand
chapter

it

jermyn
was
not
particularly
pleased
that
some
chance
had
apparently
hindered
harold
transome
from
making
other
canvassing
visits
immediately
after
leaving
lyon
and
so
had
sent
him
back
to
the
office
earlier
than
he
had
been
expected
to
come
the
inconvenient
chance
he
guessed
at
once
to
be
represented
by
felix
holt
whom
he
knew
very
well
by
trebian
report
to
be
a
young
man
with
so
little
of
the
ordinary
christian
motives
as
to
making
an
appearance
and
getting
on
in
the
world
that
he
presented
no
handle
to
any
judicious
and
respectable
person
who
might
be
willing
to
make
use
of
him
harold
transome
on
his
side
was
a
great
deal
annoyed
at
being
worried
by
felix
in
an
enquiry
about
electioneering
details
the
real
dignity
and
honesty
there
was
in
him
made
him
shrink
from
this
necessity
of
satisfying
a
man
with
a
troublesome
tongue
it
was
as
if
he
were
to
show
indignation
at
the
discovery
of
one
barrel
with
a
false
bottom
when
he
had
invested
his
money
in
a
manufactory
where
a
larger
or
smaller
number
of
such
barrels
had
always
been
made
a
practical
man
must
seek
a
good
end
by
the
only
possible
means
that
is
to
say
if
he
is
to
get
into
parliament
he
must
not
be
too
particular
it
was
not
disgraceful
to
be
neither
a
quixote
nor
a
theorist
aiming
to
correct
the
moral
rules
of
the
world
but
whatever
actually
was
or
might
prove
to
be
disgraceful
harold
held
in
detestation
in
this
mood
he
pushed
on
unceremoniously
to
the
inner
office
without
waiting
to
ask
questions
and
when
he
perceived
that
jermyn
was
not
alone
he
said
with
haughty
quickness
a
question
about
the
electioneering
at
sproxton
can
you
give
your
attention
to
it
at
once
here
is
holt
who
has
come
to
me
about
the
business
a
yes
a
certainly
said
jermyn
who
as
usual
was
the
more
cool
and
deliberate
because
he
was
vexed
he
was
standing
and
as
he
turned
round
his
broad
figure
concealed
the
person
who
was
seated
writing
at
the
bureau
holt
a
will
doubtless
a
make
a
point
of
saving
a
busy
man
time
you
can
speak
at
once
this
gentleman
here
jermyn
made
a
slight
backward
movement
of
the
head
is
one
of
ourselves
he
is
a
i
have
simply
to
complain
said
felix
that
one
of
your
agents
has
been
sent
on
a
bribing
expedition
to
sproxton
with
what
purpose
you
sir
may
know
better
than
i
do
transome
it
appears
was
ignorant
of
the
affair
and
does
not
approve
it
jermyn
looking
gravely
and
steadily
at
felix
while
he
was
speaking
at
the
same
time
drew
forth
a
small
sheaf
of
papers
from
his
side
pocket
and
then
as
he
turned
his
eyes
slowly
on
harold
felt
in
his
for
his
i
do
approve
of
it
at
all
said
harold
who
hated
calculated
slowness
and
conceit
in
his
own
impenetrability
be
good
enough
to
put
a
stop
to
it
will
you
holt
i
know
is
an
excellent
liberal
said
jermyn
just
inclining
his
head
to
harold
and
then
alternately
looking
at
felix
and
docketing
his
bills
but
he
is
perhaps
too
inexperienced
to
be
aware
that
no
canvass
a
can
be
conducted
without
the
action
of
able
men
who
must
a
be
trusted
and
not
interfered
with
and
as
to
any
possibility
of
promising
to
put
a
stop
a
to
any
procedure
a
that
depends
if
he
had
ever
held
the
coachman
ribbons
in
his
hands
as
i
have
in
my
younger
days
a
he
would
know
that
stopping
is
not
always
easy
i
know
very
little
about
holding
ribbons
said
felix
but
i
saw
clearly
enough
at
once
that
more
mischief
had
been
done
than
could
be
well
mended
though
i
believe
if
it
were
heartily
tried
the
treatment
might
be
reduced
and
something
might
be
done
to
hinder
the
men
from
turning
out
in
a
body
to
make
a
noise
which
might
end
in
worse
they
might
be
hindered
from
making
a
noise
on
our
side
said
jermyn
smiling
that
is
perfectly
true
but
if
they
made
a
noise
on
the
other
would
your
purpose
be
answered
better
sir
harold
was
moving
about
in
an
irritated
manner
while
felix
and
jermyn
were
speaking
he
preferred
leaving
the
talk
to
the
attorney
of
whose
talk
he
himself
liked
to
keep
as
clear
as
possible
i
can
only
say
answered
felix
that
if
you
make
use
of
those
heavy
fellows
when
the
drink
is
in
them
i
should
like
your
responsibility
you
might
as
well
drive
bulls
to
roar
on
our
side
as
bribe
a
set
of
colliers
and
navvies
to
shout
and
groan
a
lawyer
may
well
envy
your
command
of
language
holt
said
jermyn
pocketing
his
bills
again
and
shutting
up
his
pencil
but
he
would
not
be
satisfied
with
the
accuracy
a
of
your
terms
you
must
permit
me
to
check
your
use
of
the
word
the
essence
of
bribery
is
that
it
should
be
legally
proved
there
is
not
such
a
thing
a
rerum
a
as
unproved
bribery
there
has
been
no
such
thing
as
bribery
at
sproxton
i
answer
for
it
the
presence
of
a
body
of
stalwart
fellows
on
a
the
liberal
side
will
tend
to
preserve
order
for
we
know
that
the
benefit
clubs
from
the
pitchley
district
will
show
for
debarry
indeed
the
gentleman
who
has
conducted
the
canvass
at
sproxton
is
experienced
in
parliamentary
affairs
and
would
not
exceed
a
the
necessary
measures
that
a
rational
judgment
would
dictate
what
you
mean
the
man
who
calls
himself
johnson
said
felix
in
a
tone
of
disgust
before
jermyn
chose
to
answer
harold
broke
in
saying
quickly
and
peremptorily
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
this
holt
i
shall
desire
and
insist
that
whatever
can
be
done
by
way
of
remedy
shall
be
done
will
that
satisfy
you
you
see
now
some
of
the
difficulties
said
harold
breaking
into
his
most
agreeable
smile
i
hope
you
will
have
some
pity
for
me
i
suppose
i
must
be
content
said
felix
not
thoroughly
propitiated
i
bid
you
gentlemen
when
he
was
gone
out
and
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
harold
turning
round
and
flashing
in
spite
of
himself
an
angry
look
at
jermyn
said
and
who
is
johnson
an
i
suppose
it
seems
you
are
fond
of
the
name
jermyn
turned
perceptibly
paler
but
disagreeables
of
this
sort
between
himself
and
harold
had
been
too
much
in
his
anticipations
of
late
for
him
to
be
taken
by
surprise
he
turned
quietly
round
and
just
touched
the
shoulder
of
the
person
seated
at
the
bureau
who
now
rose
on
the
contrary
jermyn
answered
the
johnson
in
question
is
this
gentleman
whom
i
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
to
you
as
one
of
my
most
active
helpmates
in
electioneering
business
johnson
of
bedford
row
london
i
am
comparatively
a
novice
a
in
these
matters
but
he
was
engaged
with
james
putty
in
two
elections
and
there
could
scarcely
be
a
better
initiation
putty
is
one
of
the
first
men
of
the
country
as
an
agent
a
on
the
liberal
side
a
eh
johnson
i
think
makepiece
is
a
not
altogether
a
match
for
him
not
quite
of
the
same
calibre
a
consimili
a
in
tactics
a
and
in
experience
makepiece
is
a
wonderful
man
and
so
is
putty
said
the
glib
johnson
too
vain
not
to
be
pleased
with
an
opportunity
of
speaking
even
when
the
situation
was
rather
awkward
makepiece
for
scheming
but
putty
for
management
putty
knows
men
sir
he
went
on
turning
to
harold
a
thousand
pities
that
you
have
not
had
his
talents
employed
in
your
service
he
beyond
any
man
for
saving
a
candidate
money
does
half
the
work
with
his
tongue
he
talk
of
anything
from
the
areopagus
and
that
sort
of
thing
down
to
the
joke
about
are
you
going
paddy
you
know
what
i
mean
sir
again
says
paddy
an
excellent
electioneering
joke
putty
understands
these
things
he
has
said
to
me
bear
in
mind
there
are
two
ways
of
speaking
an
audience
will
always
like
one
is
to
tell
them
what
they
understand
and
the
other
is
to
tell
them
what
they
used
to
i
shall
never
be
the
man
to
deny
that
i
owe
a
great
deal
to
putty
i
always
say
it
was
a
most
providential
thing
in
the
mugham
election
last
year
that
putty
was
not
on
the
tory
side
he
managed
the
women
and
if
you
believe
me
sir
of
the
men
would
never
have
voted
if
their
wives
had
driven
them
to
it
for
the
good
of
their
families
and
as
for
speaking
it
currently
reported
in
our
london
circles
that
putty
writes
regularly
for
the
he
has
that
kind
of
language
and
i
need
tell
you
transome
that
it
the
apex
which
i
take
it
means
the
tiptop
and
nobody
can
get
higher
than
that
i
think
belonged
to
a
political
debating
society
myself
i
heard
a
little
language
in
my
time
but
when
jermyn
first
spoke
to
me
about
having
the
honor
to
assist
in
your
canvass
of
north
loamshire
here
johnson
played
with
his
and
balanced
himself
a
moment
on
his
toes
the
very
first
thing
i
said
was
there
garstin
has
got
putty
no
whig
could
stand
against
a
whig
i
said
had
putty
on
his
side
i
hope
transome
goes
in
for
something
of
a
deeper
color
i
do
say
that
as
a
general
rule
opinions
go
for
much
in
a
return
transome
it
depends
on
who
are
in
the
field
before
you
and
on
the
skill
of
your
agents
but
as
a
radical
and
a
moneyed
radical
you
are
in
a
fine
position
sir
and
with
care
and
judgment
with
care
and
judgment
it
had
been
impossible
to
interrupt
johnson
before
without
the
most
impolitic
rudeness
jermyn
was
not
sorry
that
he
should
talk
even
if
he
made
a
fool
of
himself
for
in
that
solid
shape
exhibiting
the
average
amount
of
human
foibles
he
seemed
less
of
the
which
harold
had
insinuated
him
to
be
and
had
all
the
additional
plausibility
of
a
lie
with
a
circumstance
harold
had
thrown
himself
with
contemptuous
resignation
into
a
chair
had
drawn
off
one
of
his
buff
gloves
and
was
looking
at
his
hand
but
when
johnson
gave
his
iteration
with
a
slightly
slackened
pace
harold
looked
up
at
him
and
broke
in
well
then
johnson
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
use
your
care
and
judgment
in
putting
an
end
as
well
as
you
can
to
this
sproxton
affair
else
it
may
turn
out
an
ugly
business
excuse
me
sir
i
must
beg
you
to
look
at
the
matter
a
little
more
closely
you
will
see
that
it
is
impossible
to
take
a
single
step
backward
at
sproxton
it
was
a
matter
of
necessity
to
get
the
sproxton
men
else
i
know
to
a
certainty
the
other
side
would
have
laid
hold
of
them
first
and
now
i
undermined
garstin
people
they
use
their
authority
and
give
a
little
shabby
treating
but
i
taken
all
the
wind
out
of
their
sails
but
if
by
your
orders
i
or
jermyn
here
were
to
break
promise
with
the
honest
fellows
and
offend
chubb
the
publican
what
would
come
of
it
chubb
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
against
you
sir
he
would
egg
on
his
customers
against
you
the
colliers
and
navvies
would
be
at
the
nomination
and
the
election
all
the
same
or
rather
not
all
the
same
for
they
would
be
there
against
us
and
instead
of
hustling
people
by
way
of
a
joke
and
counterbalancing
debarry
cheers
they
help
to
kick
the
cheering
and
voting
out
of
our
men
and
instead
of
being
let
us
say
ahead
of
garstin
you
be
behind
him
that
all
i
speak
plain
english
to
you
transome
though
i
the
highest
respect
for
you
as
a
gentleman
of
talents
and
position
but
sir
to
judge
of
these
things
a
man
must
know
the
english
voter
and
the
english
publican
and
it
would
be
a
poor
tale
indeed
here
johnson
mouth
took
an
expression
at
once
bitter
and
pathetic
that
a
gentleman
like
you
to
say
nothing
of
the
good
of
the
country
should
have
gone
to
the
expense
and
trouble
of
a
canvass
for
nothing
but
to
find
himself
out
of
parliament
at
the
end
of
it
i
seen
it
again
and
again
it
looks
bad
in
the
cleverest
man
to
have
to
sing
small
johnson
argument
was
not
the
less
stringent
because
his
idioms
were
vulgar
it
requires
a
conviction
and
resolution
amounting
to
heroism
not
to
wince
at
phrases
that
class
our
foreshadowed
endurance
among
those
common
and
ignominious
troubles
which
the
world
is
more
likely
to
sneer
at
than
to
pity
harold
remained
a
few
minutes
in
angry
silence
looking
at
the
floor
with
one
hand
on
his
knee
and
the
other
on
his
hat
as
if
he
were
preparing
to
start
up
as
to
undoing
anything
that
been
done
down
there
said
johnson
throwing
in
this
observation
as
something
into
the
bargain
i
must
wash
my
hands
of
it
sir
i
could
work
knowingly
against
your
interest
and
that
young
man
who
is
just
gone
out
you
do
believe
that
he
need
be
listened
to
i
hope
chubb
the
publican
hates
him
chubb
would
guess
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
your
having
the
treating
stopped
and
set
of
the
colliers
to
duck
him
in
the
canal
or
break
his
head
by
mistake
i
an
experienced
man
sir
i
hope
i
put
it
clear
enough
certainly
the
exposition
befits
the
subject
said
harold
scornfully
his
dislike
of
the
man
johnson
personality
being
stimulated
by
causes
which
jermyn
more
than
conjectured
it
a
damned
unpleasant
ravelled
business
that
you
and
jermyn
have
knit
up
between
you
i
no
more
to
say
then
sir
if
you
no
more
commands
i
do
wish
to
intrude
i
shall
wish
you
sir
said
johnson
passing
out
quickly
harold
knew
that
he
was
indulging
his
temper
and
he
would
probably
have
restrained
it
as
a
foolish
move
if
he
had
thought
there
was
great
danger
in
it
but
he
was
beginning
to
drop
much
of
his
caution
and
where
jermyn
was
concerned
under
the
growing
conviction
that
the
attorney
had
very
strong
reasons
for
being
afraid
of
him
reasons
which
would
only
be
reinforced
by
any
action
hostile
to
the
transome
interest
as
for
a
sneak
like
this
johnson
a
gentleman
had
to
pay
him
not
to
please
him
harold
had
smiles
at
command
in
the
right
place
but
he
was
not
going
to
smile
when
it
was
neither
necessary
nor
agreeable
he
was
one
of
those
yet
energetic
men
who
have
the
gift
of
anger
hatred
and
scorn
upon
occasion
though
they
are
too
healthy
and
for
such
feelings
to
get
generated
in
them
without
external
occasion
and
in
relation
to
jermyn
the
gift
was
coming
into
fine
exercise
a
pardon
me
harold
said
jermyn
speaking
as
soon
as
johnson
went
out
but
i
am
sorry
a
you
should
behave
disobligingly
to
a
man
who
has
it
in
his
power
to
do
much
service
who
in
fact
holds
many
threads
in
his
hands
i
admit
that
a
mortalium
omnibus
horis
as
we
say
a
speak
for
yourself
said
harold
i
do
talk
in
tags
of
latin
which
might
be
learned
by
a
i
find
the
english
expresses
my
meaning
better
in
the
king
english
then
said
jermyn
who
could
be
idiomatic
enough
when
he
was
stung
a
candidate
should
keep
his
kicks
till
he
a
member
oh
i
suppose
johnson
will

handsome

he
hardly
ever
wore
his
worst
expression
in
the
presence
of
others
and
but
seldom
when
he
was
alone
for
he
was
not
given
to
believe
that
any
game
would
ultimately
go
against
him
his
luck
had
been
good
new
conditions
might
always
turn
up
to
give
him
new
chances
and
if
affairs
threatened
to
come
to
an
extremity
between
harold
and
himself
he
trusted
to
finding
some
sure
resource
he
means
to
see
to
the
bottom
of
everything
if
he
can
that
quite
plain
said
jermyn
to
himself
i
believe
he
has
been
getting
another
opinion
he
has
some

about
those

that
are

he
has
inherited

there
no
denying
that
but
i
shall
beg
leave
to
tell
him
that
i
propped
up
the
family
i
do
know
where
they
would
have
been
without
me
and
if
it
comes
to
balancing
i
know
into
which
scale
the
gratitude
ought
to
go
not
that
he
likely
to
feel
any
but
he
can
feel
something
else
and
if
he
makes
signs
of
setting
the
dogs
on
me
i
shall
make
him
feel
it
the
people
named

owe
me
a
good
deal
more
than
i
owe
them
in
this
way
jermyn
inwardly
appealed
against
an
unjust
construction
which
he
foresaw
that
his
old
acquaintance
the
law
might
put
on
certain
items
in
his
history
i
have
known
persons
who
have
been
suspected
of
gratitude
and
excluding
it
from
the
list
of
virtues
but
on
closer
observation
it
has
been
seen
that
if
they
have
never
felt
grateful
it
has
been
for
want
of
an
opportunity
and
that
far
from
despising
gratitude
they
regard
it
as
the
virtue
most
of
all
incumbent
on
others
toward
them

wordsworth
jermyn
did
not
forget
to
pay
his
visit
to
the
minister
in
malthouse
yard
that
evening
the
mingled
irritation
dread
and
defiance
which
he
was
feeling
toward
harold
transome
in
the
middle
of
the
day
depended
on
too
many
and
causes
to
be
dissipated
by
eight
but
when
he
left
lyon
house
he
was
in
a
state
of
comparative
triumph
in
the
belief
that
he
and
he
alone
was
now
in
possession
of
facts
which
once
grouped
together
made
a
secret
that
gave
him
new
power
over
harold
lyon
in
his
need
for
help
from
one
who
had
that
wisdom
of
the
serpent
which
he
argued
is
not
forbidden
but
is
only
of
hard
acquirement
to
dovelike
innocence
had
been
gradually
led
to
pour
out
to
the
attorney
all
the
reasons
which
made
him
desire
to
know
the
truth
about
the
man
who
called
himself
maurice
christian
he
had
shown
all
the
precious
relics
the
locket
the
letters
and
the
marriage
certificate
and
jermyn
had
comforted
him
by
confidently
promising
to
ascertain
without
scandal
or
premature
betrayals
whether
this
man
were
really
annette
husband
or
maurice
christian
bycliffe
jermyn
was
not
rash
in
making
this
promise
since
he
had
excellent
reasons
for
believing
that
he
had
already
come
to
a
true
conclusion
on
the
subject
but
he
wished
both
to
know
a
little
more
of
this
man
himself
and
to
keep
lyon
in
ignorance
not
a
difficult
precaution
in
an
affair
which
it
cost
the
minister
so
much
pain
to
speak
of
an
easy
opportunity
of
getting
an
interview
with
christian
was
sure
to
offer
itself
before
long
might
even
offer
itself
jermyn
had
seen
him
more
than
once
though
hitherto
without
any
reason
for
observing
him
with
interest
he
had
heard
that
philip
courier
was
often
busy
in
the
town
and
it
seemed
specially
likely
that
he
would
be
seen
there
when
the
market
was
to
be
agitated
by
politics
and
the
new
candidate
was
to
show
his
paces
the
world
of
which
treby
magna
was
the
centre
was
naturally
curious
to
see
the
young
transome
who
had
come
from
the
east
was
as
rich
as
a
jew
and
called
himself
a
radical
characteristics
all
equally
vague
in
the
minds
of
various
excellent
ratepayers
who
drove
to
market
in
their
taxed
carts
or
in
their
hereditary
gigs
places
at
convenient
windows
had
been
secured
beforehand
for
a
few
best
bonnets
but
in
general
a
radical
candidate
excited
no
ardent
feminine
partisanship
even
among
the
dissenters
in
treby
if
they
were
of
the
prosperous
and
class
some
ladies
were
fond
of
remembering
that
their
family
had
been
church
others
objected
to
politics
altogether
as
having
spoiled
old
neighborliness
and
sundered
friends
who
had
kindred
views
as
to
cowslip
wine
and
michaelmas
cleaning
others
of
the
melancholy
sort
said
it
would
be
well
if
people
would
think
less
of
reforming
parliament
and
more
of
pleasing
god
irreproachable
dissenting
matrons
like
muscat
whose
youth
had
been
passed
in
a
bodice
and
tight
skirt
had
never
been
animated
by
the
struggle
for
liberty
and
had
a
timid
suspicion
that
religion
was
desecrated
by
being
applied
to
the
things
of
this
world
since
lyon
had
been
in
malthouse
yard
there
had
been
far
too
much
mixing
up
of
politics
with
religion
but
at
any
rate
these
ladies
had
never
yet
been
to
hear
speechifying
in
the
and
they
were
not
going
to
begin
that
practice
esther
however
had
heard
some
of
her
feminine
acquaintances
say
that
they
intended
to
sit
at
the
druggist
upper
window
and
she
was
inclined
to
ask
her
father
if
he
could
think
of
a
suitable
place
where
she
also
might
see
and
hear
two
inconsistent
motives
urged
her
she
knew
that
felix
cared
earnestly
for
public
questions
and
she
supposed
that
he
held
it
one
of
her
deficiencies
not
to
care
about
them
well
she
would
try
to
learn
the
secret
of
this
ardor
which
was
so
strong
in
him
that
it
animated
what
she
thought
the
dullest
form
of
life
she
was
not
too
stupid
to
find
it
out
but
this
motive
was
presently
displaced
by
a
motive
of
a
different
sort
it
had
been
a
pleasant
variety
in
her
monotonous
days
to
see
a
man
like
harold
transome
with
a
distinguished
appearance
and
polished
manners
and
she
would
like
to
see
him
again
he
suggested
to
her
that
brighter
and
more
luxurious
life
on
which
her
imagination
dwelt
without
the
painful
effort
it
required
to
conceive
the
mental
condition
which
would
place
her
in
complete
sympathy
with
felix
holt
it
was
this
less
unaccustomed
prompting
of
which
she
was
chiefly
conscious
when
she
awaited
her
father
coming
down
to
breakfast
why
indeed
should
she
trouble
herself
so
much
about
felix
lyon
more
serene
now
that
he
had
unbosomed
his
anxieties
and
obtained
a
promise
of
help
was
already
swimming
so
happily
in
the
deep
water
of
polemics
in
expectation
of
philip
debarry
answer
to
his
challenge
that
in
the
occupation
of
making
a
few
notes
lest
certain
felicitous
inspirations
should
be
wasted
he
had
forgotten
to
come
down
to
breakfast
esther
suspecting
his
abstraction
went
up
to
his
study
and
found
him
at
his
desk
looking
up
with
wonder
at
her
interruption
come
father
you
have
forgotten
your
breakfast
it
is
true
child
i
will
come
he
said
lingering
to
make
some
final
strokes
oh
you
naughty
father
said
esther
as
he
got
up
from
his
chair
your
is
twisted
your
waistcoat
is
buttoned
all
wrong
and
you
have
not
brushed
your
hair
sit
down
and
let
me
brush
it
again
as
i
did
yesterday
he
sat
down
obediently
while
esther
took
a
towel
which
she
threw
over
his
shoulders
and
then
brushed
the
thick
long
fringe
of
soft
auburn
hair
this
very
trifling
act
which
she
had
brought
herself
to
for
the
first
time
yesterday
meant
a
great
deal
in
esther
little
history
it
had
been
her
habit
to
leave
the
mending
of
her
father
clothes
to
lyddy
she
had
not
liked
even
to
touch
his
cloth
garments
still
less
had
it
seemed
a
thing
she
would
willingly
undertake
to
correct
his
toilette
and
use
a
brush
for
him
but
having
once
done
this
under
her
new
sense
of
faulty
omission
the
affectionateness
that
was
in
her
flowed
so
pleasantly
as
she
saw
how
much
her
father
was
moved
by
what
he
thought
a
great
act
of
tenderness
that
she
quite
longed
to
repeat
it
this
morning
as
he
sat
under
her
hands
his
face
had
such
a
calm
delight
in
it
that
she
could
not
help
kissing
the
top
of
his
bald
head
and
afterward
when
they
were
seated
at
breakfast
she
said
merrily
father
i
shall
make
a
of
you
your
hair
looks
so
pretty
and
silken
when
it
is
well
brushed
nay
child
i
trust
that
while
i
would
willingly
depart
from
my
evil
habit
of
a
somewhat
slovenly
forgetfulness
in
my
attire
i
shall
never
arrive
at
the
opposite
extreme
for
though
there
is
that
in
apparel
which
pleases
the
eye
and
i
deny
not
that
your
neat
gown
and
the
color
thereof
which
is
that
of
certain
little
flowers
that
spread
themselves
in
the
hedgerows
and
make
a
blueness
there
as
of
the
sky
when
it
is
deepened
in
the
water
i
deny
not
i
say
that
these
minor
strivings
after
a
perfection
which
is
as
it
were
an
irrecoverable
yet
haunting
memory
are
a
good
in
their
proportion
nevertheless
the
brevity
of
our
life
and
the
hurry
and
crush
of
the
great
battle
with
error
and
sin
often
oblige
us
to
an
advised
neglect
of
what
is
less
momentous
this
i
conceive
is
the
principle
on
which
my
friend
felix
holt
acts
and
i
can
not
but
think
the
light
comes
from
the
true
fount
though
it
shines
through
obstructions
you
have
not
seen
holt
since
sunday
have
you
father
yes
he
was
here
yesterday
he
sought
transome
having
a
matter
of
some
importance
to
speak
upon
with
him
and
i
saw
him
afterward
in
the
street
when
he
agreed
that
i
should
call
for
him
this
morning
before
i
go
into
the
he
will
have
it
lyon
went
on
smiling
that
i
must
not
walk
about
in
the
crowd
without
him
to
act
as
my
special
constable
esther
felt
vexed
with
herself
that
her
heart
was
suddenly
beating
with
unusual
quickness
and
that
her
last
resolution
not
to
trouble
herself
about
what
felix
thought
had
transformed
itself
with
magic
swiftness
into
mortification
that
he
evidently
avoided
coming
to
the
house
when
she
was
there
though
he
used
to
come
on
the
slightest
occasion
he
knew
that
she
was
always
at
home
until
the
afternoon
on
that
was
the
reason
why
he
would
not
call
for
her
father
of
course
it
was
because
he
attributed
such
littleness
to
her
that
he
supposed
she
would
retain
nothing
else
than
a
feeling
of
offence
toward
him
for
what
he
had
said
to
her
such
distrust
of
any
good
in
others
such
arrogance
of
immeasurable
superiority
was
extremely
ungenerous
but
presently
she
said
i
should
have
liked
to
hear
transome
speak
but
i
suppose
it
is
too
late
to
get
a
place
now
i
am
not
sure
i
would
fain
have
you
go
if
you
desire
it
my
dear
said
lyon
who
could
not
bear
to
deny
esther
any
lawful
wish
walk
with
me
to
holt
and
we
will
learn
from
felix
who
will
doubtless
already
have
been
out
whether
or
not
he
could
lead
you
in
safety
to
friend
lambert
esther
was
glad
of
the
proposal
because
if
it
answered
no
other
purpose
it
would
be
an
easy
way
of
obliging
felix
to
see
her
and
of
showing
him
that
it
was
not
she
who
cherished
offence
but
when
later
in
the
morning
she
was
walking
toward
holt
with
her
father
they
met
jermyn
who
stopped
them
to
ask
in
his
most
affable
manner
whether
miss
lyon
intended
to
hear
the
candidate
and
whether
she
had
secured
a
suitable
place
and
he
ended
by
insisting
that
his
daughters
who
were
presently
coming
in
an
open
carriage
should
call
for
her
if
she
would
permit
them
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
this
civility
and
esther
turned
back
to
await
the
carriage
pleased
with
the
certainty
of
hearing
and
seeing
yet
sorry
to
miss
felix
there
was
another
day
for
her
to
think
of
him
with
unsatisfied
resentment
mixed
with
some
longings
for
a
better
understanding
and
in
our
every
day
has
its
hidden
growths
in
the
mind
as
it
has
in
the
earth

little
folded
blades
are
getting

a

each

backward

forward

the

hustings

of
the
ram
inn
which
showed
its
more
plebeian
sign
at
right
angles
with

sometimes
there
were

sometimes
a

sometimes

fitful
and

sounds
the
fine

which
looked
down
from

helped
to
mark

out

attention

the
most
striking
of

group

was

as

have
been
welcomed
again
the
rector
of
little
treby
had
been
a
favorite
in
the
neighborhood
since
the
beginning
of
the
century
a
clergyman
thoroughly
unclerical
in
his
habits
had
a
piquancy
about
him
which
made
him
a
sort
of
practical
joke
he
had
always
been
called
jack
lingon
or
parson
jack
sometimes
in
older
and
less
serious
days
even
jack
he
swore
a
little
when
the
point
of
a
joke
seemed
to
demand
it
and
was
fond
of
wearing
a
colored
bandana
tied
loosely
over
his
cravat
together
with
large
brown
leather
leggings
he
spoke
in
a
pithy
familiar
way
that
people
could
understand
and
had
none
of
that
frigid
mincingness
called
dignity
which
some
have
thought
a
peculiar
clerical
disease
in
fact
he
was
a
charicter
something
cheerful
to
think
of
not
entirely
out
of
connection
with
sunday
and
sermons
and
it
seemed
in
keeping
that
he
should
have
turned
sharp
round
in
politics
his
opinions
being
only
part
of
the
excellent
joke
called
parson
jack
when
his
red
eagle
face
and
white
hair
were
seen
on
the
platform
the
dissenters
hardly
cheered
this
questionable
radical
but
to
make
amends
all
the
tory
farmers
gave
him
a
friendly
hurray
let
hear
what
old
jack
will
say
for
himself
was
the
predominant
feeling
among
them
he
have
something
funny
to
say
i
bet
a
penny
it
was
only
lawyer
labron
young
clerks
and
their
who
were
sufficiently
dead
to
trebian
traditions
to
assail
the
parson
with
various
interjections
such
as
broken
shells
and
cries
of
come
now
my
lads
he
began
in
his
full
pompous
yet
jovial
tones
thrusting
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
greatcoat
tell
you
what
i
a
parson
you
know
i
ought
to
return
good
for
evil
so
here
are
some
good
nuts
for
you
to
crack
in
return
for
your
shells
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
and
cheering
as
he
threw
handfuls
of
nuts
and
filberts
among
the
crowd
come
now
you
say
i
used
to
be
a
tory
and
some
of
you
whose
faces
i
know
as
well
as
i
know
the
head
of
my
own
will
say
why
i
a
good
fellow
but
now
i
tell
you
something
else
it
for
that
very
reason
that
i
used
to
be
a
tory
and
am
a
good
fellow
that
i
go
along
with
my
nephew
here
who
is
a
liberal
for
will
anybody
here
come
forward
and
say
good
fellow
has
no
need
to
tack
about
and
change
his
road
no
there
not
one
of
you
such
a
what
good
for
one
time
is
bad
for
another
if
anybody
contradicts
that
ask
him
to
eat
pickled
pork
when
he
thirsty
and
to
bathe
in
the
lapp
there
when
the
spikes
of
ice
are
shooting
and
that
the
reason
why
the
men
who
are
the
best
liberals
now
are
the
very
men
who
used
to
be
the
best
tories
there
is
a
nastier
horse
than
your
horse
jib
and
back
and
turn
round
when
there
is
but
one
road
for
him
to
go
and
that
the
road
before
him
and
my
nephew
here
he
comes
of
a
tory
breed
you
know
i
answer
for
the
lingons
in
the
old
tory
times
there
was
never
a
pup
belonged
to
a
lingon
but
would
howl
if
a
whig
came
near
him
the
lingon
blood
is
good
rich
old
tory
blood
like
good
rich
milk
and
that
why
when
the
right
time
comes
it
throws
up
a
liberal
cream
the
best
sort
of
tory
turns
to
the
best
sort
of
radical
there
plenty
of
radical
scum
i
say
beware
of
the
scum
and
look
but
for
the
cream
and
here
my
nephew
some
of
the
cream
if
there
is
any
none
of
your
whigs
none
of
your
painted
water
that
looks
as
if
it
ran
and
it
standing
still
all
the
while
none
of
your
fellows
a
gentleman
but
up
to
all
sorts
of
business
i
no
fool
myself
i
forced
to
wink
a
good
deal
for
fear
of
seeing
too
much
for
a
neighborly
man
must
let
himself
be
cheated
a
little
but
though
i
never
been
out
of
my
own
country
i
know
less
about
it
than
my
nephew
does
you
may
tell
what
he
is
and
only
look
at
him
there
one
sort
of
fellow
sees
nothing
but
the
end
of
his
own
nose
and
another
sort
that
sees
nothing
but
the
hinder
side
of
the
moon
but
my
nephew
harold
is
of
another
sort
he
sees
everything
at
hitting
distance
and
he
not
one
to
miss
his
mark
a
man
in
his
prime
not
a
greenhorn
not
a
shrivelled
old
fellow
come
to
speak
to
you
and
find
he
left
his
teeth
at
home
by
mistake
harold
transome
will
do
you
credit
if
anybody
says
the
radicals
are
a
set
of
sneaks
brummagem
scamps
who
want
to
play
with
the
property
of
the
country
you
can
say
at
the
member
for
north
loamshire
and
mind
what
you
hear
him
say
he
go
in
for
making
everything
right
and
charities
and
church
he
wants
to
reform
all
perhaps
you
say
that
parson
lingon
talking
about
church
reform
why
he
belongs
to
the
church
himself
he
wants
reforming
too
well
well
wait
a
bit
and
hear
that
old
parson
lingon
is
reformed
shoots
no
more
cracks
his
joke
no
more
has
drunk
his
last
bottle
the
dogs
the
old
pointers
will
be
sorry
but
you
hear
that
the
parson
at
little
treby
is
a
new
man
that
what
church
reform
is
sure
to
come
to
before
long
so
now
here
are
some
more
nuts
for
you
lads
and
i
leave
you
to
listen
to
your
candidate
here
he
is
give
him
a
good
hurray
wave
your
hats
and
i
begin
hurray
harold
had
not
been
quite
confident
beforehand
as
to
the
good
effect
of
his
uncle
introduction
but
he
was
soon
reassured
there
was
no
acrid
partisanship
among
the
tories
who
mustered
strong
about
the
marquis
of
granby
and
parson
jack
had
put
them
in
a
good
humor
harold
only
interruption
came
from
his
own
party
the
oratorical
clerk
at
the
factory
acting
as
the
tribune
of
the
dissenting
interest
and
feeling
bound
to
put
questions
might
have
been
troublesome
but
his
voice
being
unpleasantly
sharp
while
harold
was
full
and
penetrating
the
questioning
was
cried
down
harold
speech
did
it
was
not
of
the
sort
not
ponderous
not
hesitating
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
it
was
remarkable
among
british
speeches
read
in
print
the
next
day
perhaps
it
would
be
neither
pregnant
nor
conclusive
which
is
saying
no
more
than
that
its
excellence
was
not
of
an
abnormal
kind
but
such
as
is
usually
found
in
the
best
efforts
of
eloquent
candidates
accordingly
the
applause
drowned
the
opposition
and
content
predominated
but
perhaps
the
moment
of
most
diffusive
pleasure
from
public
speaking
is
that
in
which
the
speech
ceases
and
the
audience
can
turn
to
commenting
on
it
the
one
speech
sometimes
uttered
under
great
responsibility
as
to
missiles
and
other
consequences
has
given
a
text
to
twenty
speakers
who
are
under
no
responsibility
even
in
the
days
of
duelling
a
man
was
not
challenged
for
being
a
bore
nor
does
this
quality
apparently
hinder
him
from
being
much
invited
to
dinner
which
is
the
great
index
of
social
responsibility
in
a
less
barbarous
age
certainly
the
crowd
in
the
seemed
to
experience
this
culminating
enjoyment
when
the
speaking
on
the
platform
in
front
of
the
ram
had
ceased
and
there
were
no
less
than
three
orators
holding
forth
from
the
elevation
of
chance
vehicles
not
at
all
to
the
prejudice
of
the
talking
among
those
who
were
on
a
level
with
their
neighbors
there
was
little
among
the
listeners
for
queen
bess
was
striking
the
last
quarter
before
two
and
a
savory
smell
from
the
inn
kitchens
inspired
them
with
an
agreeable
consciousness
that
the
speakers
were
helping
to
trifle
away
the
brief
time
before
dinner
two
or
three
of
harold
committee
had
lingered
talking
to
each
other
on
the
platform
instead
of
and
jermyn
after
coming
out
to
speak
to
one
of
them
had
turned
to
the
corner
near
which
the
carriages
were
standing
that
he
might
tell
the
transome
coachman
to
drive
round
to
the
side
door
and
signal
to
his
own
coachman
to
follow
but
a
dialogue
which
was
going
on
below
induced
him
to
pause
and
instead
of
giving
the
order
to
assume
the
air
of
a
careless
gazer
christian
whom
the
attorney
had
already
observed
looking
out
of
a
window
at
the
marquis
of
granby
was
talking
to
dominic
the
meeting
appeared
to
be
one
of
new
recognition
for
christian
was
saying
you
not
got
gray
as
i
have
lenoni
you
not
a
day
older
for
the
sixteen
years
but
no
wonder
you
did
know
me
i
bleached
like
a
dried
bone
not
so
it
is
true
i
was
confused
a
meenute
i
could
put
your
face
nowhere
but
after
that
naples
came
behind
it
and
i
said
creesstian
and
so
you
reside
at
the
manor
and
i
am
at
transome
court
ah
it
a
thousand
pities
you
not
on
our
side
else
we
might
have
dined
together
at
the
marquis
said
christian
eh
could
you
manage
it
he
added
languidly
knowing
there
was
no
chance
of
a
yes
no
much
obliged
could
leave
the
leetle
boy
ahi
arry
arry
pinch
not
poor
moro
while
dominic
was
answering
christian
had
stared
about
him
as
his
manner
was
when
he
was
being
spoken
to
and
had
had
his
eyes
arrested
by
esther
who
was
leaning
forward
to
look
at
harold
extraordinary
little
gypsy
of
a
son
but
happening
to
meet
stare
she
felt
annoyed
drew
back
and
turned
away
her
head
coloring
who
are
those
ladies
said
christian
in
a
low
tone
to
dominic
as
if
he
had
been
startled
into
a
sudden
wish
for
this
information
they
are
meester
jermyn
daughters
said
dominic
who
knew
nothing
either
of
the
lawyer
family
or
of
esther
christian
looked
puzzled
a
moment
or
two
and
was
silent
oh
well
he
said
kissing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
as
the
coachman
having
had
jermyn
order
began
to
urge
on
the
horses
does
he
see
some
likeness
in
the
girl
thought
jermyn
as
he
turned
away
i
wish
i
had
invited
her
to
come
in
the
carriage
as
it
happens
chapter

good

sir
of
an
excellent
quaint
pattern
and
sober
color
the
market
dinner
at
the
marquis
was
in
high
repute
in
treby
and
its
neighborhood
the
frequenters
of
this
ordinary
liked
to
allude
to
it
as
men
allude
to
anything
which
implies
that
they
move
in
good
society
and
habitually
converse
with
those
who
are
in
the
secret
of
the
highest
affairs
the
guests
were
not
only
such
rural
residents
as
had
driven
to
market
but
some
of
the
most
substantial
townsmen
who
had
always
assured
their
wives
that
business
required
this
weekly
sacrifice
of
domestic
pleasure
the
poorer
farmers
who
put
up
at
the
ram
or
the
seven
stars
where
there
was
no
fish
felt
their
disadvantage
bearing
it
modestly
or
bitterly
as
the
case
might
be
and
although
the
marquis
was
a
tory
house
devoted
to
debarry
it
was
too
much
to
expect
that
such
tenants
of
the
transomes
as
had
always
been
used
to
dine
there
should
consent
to
eat
a
worse
dinner
and
sit
with
worse
company
because
they
suddenly
found
themselves
under
a
radical
landlord
opposed
to
the
political
party
known
as
sir
maxim
hence
the
recent
political
divisions
had
not
reduced
the
handsome
length
of
the
table
at
the
marquis
and
the
many
gradations
of
dignity
from
wace
the
brewer
to
the
rich
butcher
from
leek
malton
who
always
modestly
took
the
lowest
seat
though
without
the
reward
of
being
asked
to
come
up
higher
had
not
been
abbreviated
by
any
secessions
there
was
an
extra
table
spread
for
expected
supernumeraries
and
it
was
at
this
that
christian
took
his
place
with
some
of
the
younger
farmers
who
had
almost
a
sense
of
dissipation
in
talking
to
a
man
of
his
questionable
station
and
unknown
experience
the
provision
was
especially
liberal
and
on
the
whole
the
presence
of
a
minority
destined
to
vote
for
transome
was
a
ground
for
joking
which
added
to
the
good
humor
of
the
chief
talkers
a
respectable
old
acquaintance
turned
radical
rather
against
his
will
was
rallied
with
even
greater
gusto
than
if
his
wife
had
had
twins
twice
over
the
best
trebian
tories
were
far
too
to
turn
against
such
old
friends
and
to
make
no
distinction
between
them
and
the
radical
dissenting
papistical
deistical
set
with
whom
they
never
dined
and
probably
never
saw
except
in
their
imagination
but
the
talk
was
necessarily
in
abeyance
until
the
more
serious
business
of
dinner
was
ended
and
the
wine
spirits
and
tobacco
raised
mere
satisfaction
into
beatitude
among
the
frequent
though
not
regular
guests
whom
every
one
was
glad
to
see
was
nolan
the
retired
london
hosier
a
wiry
old
gentleman
past
seventy
whose
square
tight
forehead
with
its
rigid
hedge
of
gray
hair
whose
bushy
eyebrows
sharp
dark
eyes
and
remarkable
hooked
nose
gave
a
handsome
distinction
to
his
face
in
the
midst
of
rural
physiognomies
he
had
married
a
miss
pendrell
early
in
life
when
he
was
a
poor
young
londoner
and
the
match
had
been
thought
as
bad
as
ruin
by
her
family
but
fifteen
years
ago
he
had
had
the
satisfaction
of
bringing
his
wife
to
settle
amongst
her
own
friends
and
of
being
received
with
pride
as
a
retired
from
business
possessed
of
unknown
thousands
and
of
a
most
agreeable
talent
for
anecdote
and
conversation
generally
no
question
had
ever
been
raised
as
to
nolan
extraction
on
the
strength
of
his
hooked
nose
or
of
his
name
being
baruch
hebrew
names
ran
in
the
best
saxon
families
the
bible
accounted
for
them
and
no
one
among
the
uplands
and
hedgerows
of
that
district
was
suspected
of
having
an
oriental
origin
unless
he
carried
a
peddler
certainly
whatever
genealogical
research
might
have
discovered
the
worthy
baruch
nolan
was
so
free
from
any
distinctive
marks
of
religious
persuasion
he
went
to
church
with
so
ordinary
an
irregularity
and
so
often
grumbled
at
the
sermon
that
there
was
no
ground
for
classing
him
otherwise
than
with
good
trebian
churchmen
he
was
generally
regarded
as
a
old
gentleman
and
a
certain
thin
eagerness
in
his
aspect
was
attributed
to
the
life
of
the
metropolis
where
narrow
space
had
the
same
sort
of
effect
on
men
as
on
trees
nolan
always
ordered
his
pint
of
port
which
after
he
had
sipped
it
a
little
was
wont
to
animate
his
recollections
of
the
royal
family
and
the
various
ministries
which
had
been
contemporary
with
the
successive
stages
of
his
prosperity
he
was
always
listened
to
with
interest
a
man
who
had
been
born
in
the
year
when
good
old
king
george
came
to
the
throne
who
had
been
acquainted
with
the
nude
leg
of
the
prince
regent
and
hinted
at
private
reasons
for
believing
that
the
princess
charlotte
ought
not
to
have
died
had
conversational
matter
as
special
to
his
auditors
as
marco
polo
could
have
had
on
his
return
from
his
asiatic
travel
my
good
sir
he
said
to
wace
as
he
crossed
his
knees
and
spread
his
silk
handkerchief
over
them
transome
may
be
returned
or
he
may
not
be
returned
that
a
question
for
north
loamshire
but
it
makes
little
difference
to
the
kingdom
i
do
want
to
say
things
which
may
put
younger
men
out
of
spirits
but
i
believe
this
country
has
seen
best
days
i
do
indeed
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
from
one
of
your
experience
nolan
said
the
brewer
a
large
man
i
make
a
good
fight
myself
before
i
leave
a
worse
world
for
my
boys
than
i
found
for
myself
there
is
a
greater
pleasure
than
doing
a
bit
of
planting
and
improving
one
buildings
and
investing
one
money
in
some
pretty
acres
of
land
and
when
it
turns
up
here
and
there
land
you
known
from
a
boy
a
nasty
thought
that
these
radicals
are
to
turn
things
round
so
as
one
can
calculate
on
nothing
one
does
like
it
for
one
self
and
one
does
like
it
for
one
neighbors
but
somehow
i
believe
it
do
if
we
ca
trust
the
government
just
now
there
providence
and
the
good
sense
of
the
country
and
there
a
right
in
things
what
i
always
said
there
a
right
in
things
the
heavy
end
will
get
downmost
and
if
church
and
king
and
every
man
being
sure
of
his
own
are
things
good
for
this
country
there
a
god
above
will
take
care
of
it
wo
do
my
dear
sir
said
nolan
it
wo
do
when
peel
and
the
duke
turned
round
about
the
catholics
in
i
saw
it
was
all
over
with
us
we
could
never
trust
ministers
any
more
it
was
to
keep
off
a
rebellion
they
said
but
i
say
it
was
to
keep
their
places
monstrously
fond
of
place
both
of
them
that
i
know
here
nolan
changed
the
crossing
of
his
legs
and
gave
a
deep
cough
conscious
of
having
made
a
point
then
he
went
on
what
we
want
is
a
king
with
a
good
will
of
his
own
if
we
had
that
we
should
have
heard
what
we
heard
reform
would
never
have
come
to
this
pass
when
our
good
old
king
george
iii
heard
his
ministers
talking
about
catholic
emancipation
he
boxed
their
ears
all
round
ah
poor
soul
he
did
indeed
gentlemen
ended
nolan
shaken
by
a
deep
laugh
of
admiration
well
now
that
something
like
a
king
said
crowder
who
was
an
eager
listener
it
was
uncivil
though
how
did
they
take
it
said
timothy
rose
a
gentleman
farmer
from
leek
malton
against
whose
independent
position
nature
had
provided
the
safeguard
of
a
spontaneous
servility
his
large
porcine
cheeks
round
twinkling
eyes
and
thumbs
habitually
twirling
expressed
a
concentrated
effort
not
to
get
into
trouble
and
to
speak
everybody
fair
except
when
they
were
safely
out
of
hearing
take
it
they
be
obliged
to
take
it
said
the
impetuous
young
joyce
a
farmer
of
superior
information
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
prerogative
i
do
say
but
what
i
have
said
rose
retreating
i
nothing
against
it
nothing
at
all
no
but
the
radicals
have
said
young
joyce
winking
the
prerogative
is
what
they
want
to
clip
close
they
want
us
to
be
governed
by
delegates
from
the
who
are
to
dictate
to
everybody
and
make
everything
square
to
their
mastery
they
a
pretty
set
now
these
delegates
said
wace
with
disgust
i
once
heard
two
of
spouting
away
they
a
sort
of
fellow
i
never
employ
in
my
brewery
or
anywhere
else
i
seen
it
again
and
again
if
a
man
takes
to
it
all
over
with
him
wrong
says
he
that
a
big
text
but
does
he
want
to
make
everything
right
not
he
he
lose
his
text
want
every
good
say
they
why
they
never
knew
yet
what
a
man
good
is
how
should
they
it
working
for
his
victual
not
getting
a
slice
of
other
people
ay
ay
said
young
joyce
cordially
i
should
just
have
liked
all
the
delegates
in
the
country
mustered
for
our
yeomanry
to
go
into
all
they
see
where
the
strength
of
old
england
lay
then
you
may
tell
what
it
is
for
a
country
to
trust
to
trade
when
it
breeds
such
spindling
fellows
as
those
that
is
the
fault
of
trade
my
good
sir
said
nolan
who
was
often
a
little
pained
by
the
defects
of
provincial
culture
trade
properly
conducted
is
good
for
a
man
constitution
i
could
have
shown
you
in
my
time
weavers
past
seventy
with
all
their
faculties
as
sharp
as
a
doing
without
spectacles
it
the
new
system
of
trade
that
to
blame
a
country
ca
have
too
much
trade
if
it
properly
managed
plenty
of
sound
tories
have
made
their
fortune
by
trade
heard
of
calibut
everybody
has
heard
of
calibut
well
sir
i
knew
old
calibut
as
well
as
i
know
you
he
was
once
a
crony
of
mine
in
a
city
warehouse
and
now
i
answer
for
it
he
has
a
larger
rent
roll
than
lord
wyvern
bless
your
soul
his
subscriptions
to
charities
would
make
a
fine
income
for
a
nobleman
and
he
as
good
a
tory
as
i
am
and
as
for
his
town
establishment
why
how
much
butter
do
you
think
is
consumed
there
annually
nolan
paused
and
then
his
face
glowed
with
triumph
as
he
answered
his
own
question
why
gentlemen
not
less
than
two
thousand
pounds
of
butter
during
the
few
months
the
family
is
in
town
trade
makes
property
my
good
sir
and
property
is
conservative
as
they
say
now
calibut
is
lord
fortinbras
he
paid
me
a
large
debt
on
his
marriage
it
all
one
web
sir
the
prosperity
of
the
country
is
one
web
to
be
sure
said
christian
who
smoking
his
cigar
with
his
chair
turned
away
from
the
table
was
willing
to
make
himself
agreeable
in
the
conversation
we
ca
do
without
nobility
look
at
france
when
they
got
rid
of
the
old
nobles
they
were
obliged
to
make
new
true
very
true
said
nolan
who
thought
christian
a
little
too
wise
for
his
position
but
could
not
resist
the
rare
gift
of
an
instance
in
point
it
the
french
revolution
that
has
done
us
harm
here
it
was
the
same
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
but
the
war
kept
it
off
pitt
saved
us
i
knew
pitt
i
had
a
particular
interview
with
him
once
he
joked
me
about
getting
the
length
of
his
foot
nolan
said
he
are
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
whose
name
begins
with
who
would
be
glad
to
know
what
you
know
i
was
recommended
to
send
an
account
of
that
to
the
newspapers
after
his
death
poor
man
but
i
not
fond
of
that
kind
of
show
myself
nolan
swung
his
upper
leg
a
little
and
pinched
his
lip
between
his
thumb
and
finger
naturally
pleased
with
his
own
moderation
no
no
very
right
said
wace
cordially
but
you
never
said
a
truer
word
than
that
about
property
if
a
man
got
a
bit
of
property
a
stake
in
the
country
he
want
to
keep
things
square
where
jack
safe
tom
in
danger
but
that
what
makes
it
such
an
uncommonly
nasty
thing
that
a
man
like
transome
should
take
up
with
these
radicals
my
belief
he
does
it
only
to
get
into
parliament
he
turn
round
when
he
gets
there
come
dibbs
there
something
to
put
you
in
spirits
added
wace
raising
his
voice
a
little
and
looking
at
a
guest
lower
down
you
got
to
vote
for
a
radical
with
one
side
of
your
mouth
and
make
a
wry
face
with
the
other
but
he
turn
round
as
parson
jack
says
he
got
the
right
sort
of
blood
in
him
i
do
care
two
straws
who
i
vote
for
said
dibbs
sturdily
i
not
going
to
make
a
wry
face
it
stands
to
reason
a
man
should
vote
for
his
landlord
my
farm
in
good
condition
and
i
got
the
best
pasture
on
the
estate
the
rot
never
come
nigh
me
let
them
grumble
as
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
hedge
i
wonder
if
jermyn
bring
him
in
though
said
sircome
the
great
miller
he
an
uncommon
fellow
for
carrying
things
through
i
know
he
brought
me
through
that
suit
about
my
weir
it
cost
a
pretty
penny
but
he
brought
me
through
it
a
bit
of
a
pill
for
him
too
having
to
turn
radical
said
wace
they
say
he
counted
on
making
friends
with
sir
maximus
by
this
young
one
coming
home
and
joining
with
mr
philip
but
i
bet
a
penny
he
brings
transome
in
said
sircome
folks
say
he
has
got
many
votes
hereabout
but
toward
duffield
and
all
there
where
the
radicals
are
everybody
for
him
eh
christian
come
you
at
the
what
do
they
say
about
it
now
at
the
manor
when
general
attention
was
called
to
christian
young
joyce
looked
down
at
his
own
legs
and
touched
the
curves
of
his
own
hair
as
if
measuring
his
own
approximation
to
that
correct
copy
of
a
gentleman
wace
turned
his
head
to
listen
for
christian
answer
with
that
tolerance
of
inferiority
which
becomes
men
in
places
of
public
resort
they
think
it
will
be
a
hard
run
between
transome
and
garstin
said
christian
it
depends
on
transome
getting
plumpers
well
i
know
i
shall
not
split
for
garstin
said
wace
nonsense
for
debarry
voters
to
split
for
a
whig
a
man
either
a
tory
or
not
a
tory
it
seems
reasonable
there
should
be
one
of
each
side
said
timothy
rose
i
do
like
showing
favor
either
way
if
one
side
ca
lower
the
poor
rates
and
take
off
the
tithe
let
the
other
try
but
there
this
in
it
wace
said
sircome
i
not
altogether
against
the
whigs
for
they
do
want
to
go
so
far
as
the
radicals
do
and
when
they
find
they
slipped
a
bit
too
far
they
hold
on
all
the
tighter
and
the
whigs
have
got
the
upper
hand
now
and
it
no
use
fighting
with
the
current
i
run
with
the
sircome
checked
himself
looked
furtively
at
christian
and
to
divert
criticisms
ended
with
eh
mr
nolan
there
have
been
eminent
whigs
sir
fox
was
a
whig
said
nolan
fox
was
a
great
orator
he
was
very
intimate
with
the
prince
of
wales
i
seen
him
and
the
duke
of
york
too
go
home
by
daylight
with
their
hats
crushed
fox
was
a
great
leader
of
opposition
government
requires
an
opposition
the
whigs
should
always
be
in
opposition
and
the
tories
on
the
ministerial
side
that
what
the
country
used
to
like
whigs
for
salt
and
mustard
the
tories
for
meat
gottlib
the
banker
used
to
say
to
me
gottlib
was
a
worthy
man
when
there
was
a
great
run
on
gottlib
bank
in
i
saw
a
gentleman
come
in
with
bags
of
gold
and
say
gottlib
there
plenty
more
where
that
came
from
it
stopped
the
run
gentlemen
it
did
indeed
this
anecodote
was
received
with
great
admiration
but
sircome
returned
to
the
previous
question
there
now
you
see
wace
it
right
there
should
be
whigs
as
well
as
tories
pitt
and
fox
i
always
heard
them
go
together
well
i
do
like
garstin
said
the
brewer
i
did
like
his
conduct
about
the
canal
company
of
the
two
i
like
transome
best
if
a
nag
is
to
throw
me
i
say
let
him
have
some
blood
as
for
blood
wace
said
salt
the
a
bilious
man
who
only
spoke
when
there
was
a
good
opportunity
of
contradicting
ask
my
labron
a
little
about
that
these
transomes
are
not
the
old
blood
well
they
the
oldest
that
forthcoming
i
suppose
said
wace
laughing
unless
you
believe
in
mad
old
tommy
trounsem
i
wonder
where
that
old
poaching
fellow
is
now
i
saw
him
the
other
day
said
young
joyce
he
got
a
with
handbills
in
it
over
his
shoulder
i
thought
the
old
fellow
was
dead
said
wace
hey
why
jermyn
he
went
on
merrily
as
he
turned
round
and
saw
the
attorney
entering
you
radical
how
dare
you
show
yourself
in
this
tory
house
come
this
is
going
a
bit
too
far
we
do
mind
old
harry
managing
our
law
for
us
that
his
proper
business
from
time
immemorial
but
but
a
said
jermyn
smiling
always
ready
to
carry
on
a
joke
to
which
his
slow
manner
gave
the
piquancy
of
surprise
if
he
meddles
with
politics
he
must
be
a
tory
jermyn
was
not
afraid
to
show
himself
anywhere
in
treby
he
knew
many
people
were
not
exactly
fond
of
him
but
a
man
can
do
without
that
if
he
is
prosperous
a
provincial
lawyer
in
those
days
was
as
independent
of
personal
esteem
as
if
he
had
been
a
lord
chancellor
there
was
a
laugh
at
this
upper
end
of
the
room
as
jermyn
seated
himself
at
about
an
equal
angle
between
wace
and
christian
we
were
talking
about
old
tommy
trounsem
you
remember
him
they
say
he
turned
up
again
said
wace
ah
said
jermyn
indifferently
but
a
wace
i
very
busy
but
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
that
bit
of
land
of
yours
at
the
corner
of
pod
end
i
had
a
handsome
offer
for
you
i
not
at
liberty
to
say
from
whom
but
an
offer
that
ought
to
tempt
you
it
wo
tempt
me
said
wace
peremptorily
if
i
got
a
bit
of
land
i
keep
it
it
hard
enough
to
get
hereabouts
then
i
to
understand
that
you
refuse
all
negotiation
said
jermyn
who
had
ordered
a
glass
of
sherry
and
was
looking
around
slowly
as
he
sipped
it
till
his
eyes
seemed
to
rest
for
the
first
time
on
christian
though
he
had
seen
him
at
once
on
entering
the
room
unless
one
of
the
confounded
railways
should
come
but
then
i
stand
out
and
make
bleed
for
it
there
was
a
murmur
of
approbation
the
railways
were
a
public
wrong
much
denunciated
in
treby
a
philip
debarry
at
the
manor
now
said
jermyn
suddenly
questioning
christian
in
a
haughty
tone
of
superiority
which
he
often
chose
to
use
no
said
christian
he
is
expected
morning
ah
jermyn
paused
a
moment
or
two
and
then
said
you
are
sufficiently
in
his
confidence
i
think
to
carry
a
message
to
him
with
a
small
document
debarry
has
often
trusted
me
so
far
said
christian
with
much
coolness
but
if
the
business
is
yours
you
can
probably
find
some
one
you
know
better
there
was
a
little
winking
and
grimacing
among
those
of
the
company
who
heard
this
answer
a
true
a
said
jermyn
not
showing
any
offence
if
you
decline
but
i
think
if
you
will
do
me
the
favor
to
step
round
to
my
residence
on
your
way
back
and
learn
the
business
you
will
prefer
carrying
it
yourself
at
my
residence
if
you
please
not
my
office
oh
very
well
said
christian
i
shall
be
very
happy
christian
never
allowed
himself
to
be
treated
as
a
servant
by
anyone
but
his
master
and
his
master
treated
a
servant
more
deferentially
than
an
equal
will
it
be
five
what
hour
shall
we
say
said
jermyn
christian
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
about
five
i
can
be
there
very
good
said
jermyn
finishing
his
sherry
well
a
wace
a
so
you
will
hear
nothing
about
pod
end
not
i
a
mere
not
enough
to
swear
here
face
broke
into
a
smile
without
a
never
mind
it
mine
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
up
to
the
sky
i
can
build
the
tower
of
babel
on
it
if
i
like
eh
mr
nolan
a
bad
investment
my
good
sir
said
nolan
who
enjoyed
a
certain
flavor
of
infidelity
in
this
smart
reply
and
laughed
much
at
it
in
his
inward
way
see
now
how
blind
you
tories
are
said
jermyn
rising
if
i
had
been
your
lawyer
i
have
had
you
make
another
freeholder
with
that
land
and
all
in
time
for
this
election
but
a
the
verbum
sapientibus
comes
a
little
too
late
now
jermyn
was
moving
away
as
he
finished
speaking
but
wace
called
out
after
him
we
not
so
badly
off
for
votes
as
you
are
good
sound
votes
that
stand
the
revising
barrister
debarry
at
the
top
of
the
poll
the
lawyer
was
already
out
of
the
doorway
chapter
xxi
is
grievous
that
with
all
amplification
of
travel
both
by
sea
and
land
a
man
can
never
separate
himself
from
his
past
history
jermyn
handsome
house
stood
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
surrounded
by
garden
and
lawn
and
plantations
of
hopeful
trees
as
christian
approached
it
he
was
in
a
perfectly
easy
state
of
mind
the
business
he
was
going
on
was
none
of
his
otherwise
than
as
he
was
well
satisfied
with
any
opportunity
of
making
himself
valuable
to
philip
debarry
as
he
looked
at
jermyn
length
of
wall
and
iron
railing
he
said
to
himself
these
lawyers
are
the
fellows
for
getting
on
in
the
world
with
the
least
expense
of
civility
with
this
cursed
conjuring
secret
of
theirs
called
law
they
think
everybody
is
frightened
at
them
my
lord
jermyn
seems
to
have
his
insolence
as
ready
as
his
soft
sawder
he
as
sleek
as
a
rat
and
has
as
vicious
a
tooth
i
know
the
sort
of
vermin
well
enough
i
helped
to
fatten
one
or
two
in
this
mood
of
conscious
contemptuous
penetration
christian
was
shown
by
the
footman
into
jermyn
private
room
where
the
attorney
sat
surrounded
with
massive
oaken
bookcases
and
other
furniture
to
correspond
from
the
to
the
calendar
frame
and
it
was
the
sort
of
a
room
a
man
prepares
for
himself
when
he
feels
sure
of
a
long
and
respectable
future
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
leather
chair
against
the
broad
window
opening
on
the
lawn
and
had
just
taken
off
his
spectacles
and
let
the
newspaper
fall
on
his
knees
in
despair
of
reading
by
the
fading
light
when
the
footman
opened
the
door
and
said
christian
jermyn
said
good
evening
christian
be
seated
pointing
to
a
chair
opposite
himself
and
the
window
light
the
candles
on
the
shelf
john
but
leave
the
blinds
alone
he
did
not
speak
again
till
the
man
was
gone
out
but
appeared
to
be
referring
to
a
document
which
lay
on
the
bureau
before
him
when
the
door
was
closed
he
drew
himself
up
again
began
to
rub
his
hands
and
turned
toward
his
visitor
who
seemed
perfectly
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
the
attorney
was
in
shadow
and
that
the
light
fell
on
himself
a
your
name
a
is
henry
scaddon
there
was
a
start
through
christian
frame
which
he
was
quick
enough
almost
simultaneously
to
try
and
disguise
as
a
change
of
position
he
uncrossed
his
legs
and
unbuttoned
his
coat
but
before
he
had
time
to
say
anything
jermyn
went
on
with
slow
emphasis
you
were
born
on
the
sixteenth
of
december
at
blackheath
your
father
was
a
in
london
he
died
when
you
were
barely
of
age
leaving
an
extensive
business
before
you
were
you
had
run
through
the
greater
part
of
the
property
and
had
compromised
your
safety
by
an
attempt
to
defraud
your
creditors
subsequently
you
forged
a
check
on
your
father
elder
brother
who
had
intended
to
make
you
his
heir
here
jermyn
paused
a
moment
and
referred
to
the
document
christian
was
silent
in
you
found
it
expedient
to
leave
this
country
in
a
military
disguise
and
were
taken
prisoner
by
the
french
on
the
occasion
of
an
exchange
of
prisoners
you
had
the
opportunity
of
returning
to
your
own
country
and
to
the
bosom
of
your
own
family
you
were
generous
enough
to
sacrifice
that
prospect
in
favor
of
a
of
about
your
own
age
and
figure
who
had
more
pressing
reasons
than
yourself
for
wishing
to
be
on
this
side
of
the
water
you
exchanged
dress
luggage
and
names
with
him
and
he
passed
to
england
instead
of
you
as
henry
scaddon
almost
immediately
afterward
you
escaped
from
your
imprisonment
after
feigning
an
illness
which
prevented
your
exchange
of
names
from
being
discovered
and
it
was
reported
that
you
that
is
you
under
the
name
of
your
were
drowned
in
an
open
boat
trying
to
reach
a
neapolitan
vessel
bound
for
malta
nevertheless
i
have
to
congratulate
you
on
the
falsehood
of
that
report
and
on
the
certainty
that
you
are
now
after
the
lapse
of
more
than
twenty
years
seated
here
in
perfect
safety
jermyn
paused
so
long
that
he
was
evidently
awaiting
some
answer
at
last
christian
replied
in
a
dogged
tone
well
sir
i
heard
much
longer
stories
than
that
told
quite
as
solemnly
when
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
them
suppose
i
deny
the
very
peg
you
hang
your
statement
on
suppose
i
say
i
am
not
henry
scaddon
a
in
that
case
a
said
jermyn
with
wooden
indifference
you
would
lose
the
advantage
which
a
may
attach
to
your
possession
of
henry
scaddon
knowledge
and
at
the
same
time
if
it
were
in
the
least
a
inconvenient
to
you
that
you
should
be
recognized
as
henry
scaddon
your
denial
would
not
prevent
me
from
holding
the
knowledge
and
evidence
which
i
possess
on
that
point
it
would
only
prevent
us
from
pursuing
the
present
conversation
well
sir
suppose
we
admit
for
the
sake
of
the
conversation
that
your
account
of
the
matter
is
the
true
one
what
advantage
have
you
to
offer
the
man
named
henry
scaddon
the
advantage
a
is
problematical
but
it
may
be
considerable
it
might
in
fact
release
you
from
the
necessity
of
acting
as
courier
or
a
valet
or
whatever
other
office
you
may
occupy
which
prevents
you
from
being
your
own
master
on
the
other
hand
my
acquaintance
with
your
secret
is
not
necessarily
a
disadvantage
to
you
to
put
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
i
am
not
inclined
a
gratuitously
to
do
you
any
harm
and
i
may
be
able
to
do
you
a
considerable
service
which
you
want
me
to
earn
somehow
said
christian
you
offer
me
a
turn
in
a
lottery
precisely
the
matter
in
question
is
of
no
earthly
interest
to
you
except
a
as
it
may
yield
you
a
prize
we
lawyers
have
to
do
with
complicated
questions
and
a
legal
subtleties
which
are
never
a
fully
known
even
to
the
parties
immediately
interested
still
less
to
the
witnesses
shall
we
agree
then
that
you
continue
to
retain
of
the
name
which
you
gained
by
exchange
and
that
you
oblige
me
by
answering
certain
questions
as
to
the
experience
of
henry
scaddon
very
good
go
on
what
articles
of
property
once
belonging
to
your
maurice
christian
bycliffe
do
you
still
retain
this
ring
said
christian
twirling
round
the
fine
on
his
finger
his
watch
and
the
little
matters
that
hung
with
it
and
a
case
of
papers
i
got
rid
of
a
gold
once
when
i
was
hard
up
the
clothes
are
all
gone
of
course
we
exchanged
everything
it
was
all
done
in
a
hurry
bycliffe
thought
we
should
meet
again
in
england
before
long
and
he
was
mad
to
get
there
but
that
was
impossible
i
mean
that
we
should
meet
soon
after
i
do
know
what
become
of
him
else
i
would
give
him
up
his
papers
and
the
watch
and
so
on
though
you
know
it
was
i
who
did
the
service
and
he
felt
that
you
were
at
vesoul
together
before
being
moved
to
verdun
yes
what
else
do
you
know
about
bycliffe
oh
nothing
very
particular
said
christian
pausing
and
rapping
his
boot
with
his
cane
he
been
in
the
hanoverian
army
a
fellow
took
nothing
easily
not
in
health
he
made
a
fool
of
himself
with
marrying
at
vesoul
and
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
with
the
girl
relations
and
then
when
the
prisoners
were
ordered
off
they
had
to
part
whether
they
ever
got
together
again
i
do
know
was
the
marriage
all
right
then
oh
all
on
the
square
civil
marriage
church
everything
bycliffe
was
a
fool
a
proud
headstrong
fellow
how
long
did
the
marriage
take
place
before
you
left
vesoul
about
three
months
i
was
witness
to
the
marriage
and
you
know
no
more
about
the
wife
not
afterward
i
knew
her
very
well
before
pretty
annette
annette
ledru
was
her
name
she
was
of
a
good
family
and
they
had
made
up
a
fine
match
for
her
but
she
was
one
of
your
meek
little
diablesses
who
have
a
will
of
their
own
once
in
their
lives
the
will
to
choose
their
own
master
bycliffe
was
not
open
to
you
about
his
other
affairs
oh
no
a
fellow
you
would
dare
to
ask
a
question
of
people
told
him
everything
but
he
told
nothing
in
return
if
madame
annette
ever
found
him
again
she
found
her
lord
and
master
with
a
vengeance
but
she
was
a
regular
lapdog
however
her
family
shut
her
up
made
a
prisoner
of
her
to
prevent
her
running
away
ah
good
much
of
what
you
have
been
so
obliging
as
to
say
is
irrelevant
to
any
possible
purpose
of
mine
which
in
fact
has
only
to
do
with
a
mouldy
that
might
be
aired
some
day
you
will
doubtless
on
your
own
account
maintain
perfect
silence
on
what
has
passed
between
us
and
with
that
condition
duly
preserved
a
it
is
possible
that
a
the
lottery
you
have
put
into
as
you
observe
may
turn
up
a
prize
this
then
is
all
the
business
you
have
with
me
said
christian
rising
all
you
will
of
course
preserve
carefully
all
the
papers
and
other
articles
which
have
so
many
a
recollections
a
attached
to
them
oh
yes
if
there
any
chance
of
bycliffe
turning
up
again
i
shall
be
sorry
to
have
parted
with
the
but
i
was
at
naples
in
fact
as
you
see
i
was
obliged
at
last
to
turn
courier
an
exceedingly
agreeable
life
for
a
man
of
some
a
accomplishments
and
a
no
income
said
jermyn
rising
and
reaching
a
candle
which
he
placed
against
his
desk
christian
knew
this
was
a
sign
that
he
was
expected
to
go
but
he
lingered
standing
with
one
hand
on
the
back
of
his
chair
at
last
he
said
rather
sulkily
i
think
you
too
clever
jermyn
not
to
perceive
that
i
not
a
man
to
be
made
a
fool
of
well
a
it
may
perhaps
be
a
still
better
guarantee
for
you
said
jermyn
smiling
that
i
see
no
use
in
attempting
that
a
metamorphosis
the
old
gentleman
who
ought
never
to
have
felt
himself
injured
is
dead
now
and
i
not
afraid
of
creditors
after
more
than
twenty
years
certainly
not
a
there
may
indeed
be
claims
which
ca
assert
themselves
a
legally
which
yet
are
molesting
to
a
man
of
some
reputation
but
you
may
perhaps
be
happily
free
from
such
fears
jermyn
drew
round
his
chair
toward
the
bureau
and
christian
too
acute
to
persevere
uselessly
said
and
left
the
room
after
leaning
back
in
his
chair
to
reflect
a
few
minutes
jermyn
wrote
the
following
letter
dear
johnson
i
learn
from
your
letter
received
this
morning
that
you
intend
returning
to
town
on
saturday
while
you
are
there
be
so
good
as
to
see
medwin
who
used
to
be
with
batt
cowley
and
ascertain
from
him
indirectly
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
on
other
topics
whether
in
that
old
business
in
scaddon
bycliffe
or
bycliffe
scaddon
before
his
imprisonment
gave
batt
cowley
any
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
married
and
expected
to
have
a
child
the
question
as
you
know
is
of
no
practical
importance
but
i
wish
to
draw
up
an
abstract
of
the
bycliffe
case
and
the
exact
position
in
which
it
stood
before
the
suit
was
closed
by
the
death
of
the
plaintiff
in
order
that
if
harold
transome
desires
it
he
may
see
how
the
failure
of
the
last
claim
has
secured
the
title
and
whether
there
is
a
hair
breadth
of
chance
that
another
claim
should
be
set
up
of
course
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
such
a
chance
for
even
if
batt
cowley
were
to
suppose
that
they
had
alighted
on
a
surviving
representative
of
the
bycliffes
it
would
not
enter
their
heads
to
set
up
a
new
claim
since
they
brought
evidence
that
the
last
life
which
suspended
the
bycliffe
remainder
was
extinct
before
the
case
was
closed
a
good
twenty
years
ago
still
i
want
to
show
the
present
heir
of
the
the
exact
condition
of
the
family
title
to
the
estates
so
get
me
an
answer
from
medwin
on
the
above
mentioned
point
i
shall
meet
you
at
duffield
next
week
we
must
get
transome
returned
never
mind
his
having
been
a
little
rough
the
other
day
but
go
on
doing
what
you
know
is
necessary
for
his
interest
his
interest
is
mine
which
i
need
not
say
is
john
johnson
yours
faithfully
matthew
jermyn
when
the
attorney
had
sealed
this
letter
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
again
he
was
inwardly
saying
now
harold
i
shall
shut
up
this
affair
in
a
private
drawer
till
you
choose
to
take
any
extreme
measures
which
will
force
me
to
bring
it
out
i
have
the
matter
entirely
in
my
own
power
no
one
but
old
lyon
knows
about
the
girl
birth
no
one
but
scaddon
can
clench
the
evidence
about
bycliffe
and
i
got
scaddon
under
my
thumb
no
soul
except
myself
and
johnson
who
is
a
limb
of
myself
knows
that
there
is
one
life
which
may
presently
leave
the
girl
a
new
claim
to
the
bycliffe
heirship
i
shall
learn
through
methurst
whether
batt
cowley
knew
through
bycliffe
of
this
woman
having
come
to
england
i
shall
hold
all
the
threads
between
my
thumb
and
finger
i
can
use
the
evidence
or
i
can
nullify
it
and
so
if
harold
pushes
me
to
extremity
and
threatens
me
with
chancery
and
ruin
i
have
an
opposing
threat
which
will
either
save
me
or
turn
into
a
punishment
for
him
he
rose
put
out
his
candles
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
looking
out
on
the
dim
lawn
with
its
black
twilight
fringe
of
shrubs
still
meditating
quick
thought
was
gleaming
over
years
filled
with
devices
more
or
less
clever
more
or
less
desirable
to
be
avowed
those
which
might
be
avowed
with
impunity
were
not
always
to
be
distinguished
as
innocent
by
comparison
with
those
which
it
was
advisable
to
conceal
in
a
profession
where
much
that
is
noxious
may
be
done
without
disgrace
is
a
conscience
likely
to
be
without
balm
when
circumstances
have
urged
a
man
to
overstep
the
line
where
his
good
technical
information
makes
him
aware
that
with
discovery
disgrace
is
likely
to
begin
with
regard
to
the
transome
affairs
the
family
had
been
in
pressing
need
of
money
and
it
had
lain
with
him
to
get
it
for
them
was
it
to
be
expected
that
he
would
not
consider
his
own
advantage
where
he
had
rendered
services
such
as
are
never
fully
paid
if
it
came
to
a
question
of
right
and
wrong
instead
of
law
the
least
justifiable
things
he
had
ever
done
had
been
done
on
behalf
of
the
transomes
it
had
been
a
deucedly
unpleasant
thing
for
him
to
get
bycliffe
arrested
and
thrown
into
prison
as
henry
scaddon
perhaps
hastening
the
man
death
in
that
way
but
if
it
had
not
been
done
by
dint
of
his
jermyn
exertions
and
tact
he
would
like
to
know
where
the
might
have
been
by
this
time
as
for
right
or
wrong
if
the
truth
were
known
the
very
possession
of
the
estate
by
the
was
owing
to
that
took
place
nearly
a
century
ago
when
the
original
old
durfey
got
his
base
fee
but
inward
argument
of
this
sort
now
as
always
was
merged
in
anger
in
exasperation
that
harold
precisely
harold
transome
should
have
turned
out
to
be
the
probable
instrument
of
a
visitation
which
would
be
bad
luck
not
justice
for
is
there
any
justice
where
out
of
every
hundred
escape
he
felt
himself
beginning
to
hate
harold
as
he
had
never
just
then
jermyn
third
daughter
a
tall
slim
girl
wrapped
in
a
white
woollen
shawl
which
she
had
hung
over
her
skipped
across
the
lawn
toward
the
greenhouse
to
get
a
flower
jermyn
was
startled
and
did
not
identify
the
figure
or
rather
he
identified
it
falsely
with
another
tall
figure
which
had
sometimes
set
his
heart
beating
quickly
more
than
thirty
years
before
for
a
moment
he
was
fully
back
in
those
distant
years
when
he
and
another
person
had
seen
no
reason
why
they
should
not
indulge
their
passion
and
their
vanity
and
determine
for
themselves
how
their
lives
should
be
made
delightful
in
spite
of
unalterable
external
conditions
the
reasons
had
been
unfolding
themselves
gradually
ever
since
through
all
the
years
which
had
converted
the
handsome
slim
young
jermyn
with
a
touch
of
sentiment
into
a
portly
lawyer
of
sixty
for
whom
life
had
resolved
itself
into
the
means
of
keeping
up
his
head
among
his
professional
brethren
and
maintaining
an
establishment
into
a
husband
and
father
whose
third
affectionate
and
expensive
daughter
now
rapped
at
the
window
and
called
to
him
papa
papa

ready
for
dinner
do
you
remember
that
the
lukyns

had
not
looked
in
at
malthouse
yard
to
talk
over
the
public
events
with
lyon
when
esther
was
dressing
the
next
morning
she
had
reached
a
point
of
irritated
anxiety
to
see
felix
at
which
she
found
herself
devising
little
schemes
for
attaining
that
end
in
some
way
that
would
be
so
elaborate
as
to
seem
perfectly
natural
her
watch
had
a
ailment
of
losing
possibly
it
wanted
cleaning
felix
would
tell
her
if
it
merely
wanted
regulating
whereas
prowd
might
detain
it
unnecessarily
and
cause
her
useless
inconvenience
or
could
she
not
get
a
valuable
hint
from
holt
about
the
bread
which
was
something
as
sad
as
lyddy
herself
or
if
she
came
home
that
way
at
twelve
felix
might
be
going
out
she
might
meet
him
and
not
be
obliged
to
call
or
but
it
would
be
very
much
beneath
her
to
take
any
steps
of
this
sort
her
watch
had
been
losing
for
the
last
two
months
why
should
it
not
go
on
losing
a
little
longer
she
could
think
of
no
devices
that
were
not
so
transparent
as
to
be
undignified
all
the
more
undignified
because
felix
chose
to
live
in
a
way
that
would
prevent
any
one
from
classing
him
according
to
his
education
and
mental
refinement
which
certainly
are
very
high
said
esther
inwardly
coloring
as
if
in
answer
to
some
contrary
allegation
else
i
should
not
think
his
opinion
of
any
consequence
but
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
could
not
possibly
call
at
holt
it
followed
that
up
to
a
few
minutes
past
twelve
when
she
reached
the
turning
toward
holt
she
believed
that
she
should
go
home
the
other
way
but
at
the
last
moment
there
is
always
a
reason
not
existing
before
namely
the
impossibility
of
further
vacillation
esther
turned
the
corner
without
any
visible
pause
and
in
another
minute
was
knocking
at
holt
door
not
without
an
inward
flutter
which
she
was
bent
on
disguising
it
never
you
miss
lyon
who
have
thought
of
seeing
you
at
this
time
is
the
minister
ill
i
thought
he
looked
creechy
if
you
want
help
i
put
my
bonnet
on
do
keep
miss
lyon
at
the
door
mother
ask
her
to
come
in
said
the
ringing
voice
of
felix
surmounting
various
small
shufflings
and
babbling
voices
within
it
my
wish
for
her
to
come
in
i
sure
said
holt
making
way
but
what
is
there
for
her
to
come
in
to
a
floor
worse
than
any
public
but
step
in
pray
if
you
so
inclined
when
i
been
forced
to
take
my
bit
of
carpet
up
and
have
benches
i
do
see
why
i
need
mind
nothing
no
more
i
only
came
to
ask
holt
if
he
would
look
at
my
watch
for
me
said
esther
entering
and
blushing
a
general
he
do
that
fast
enough
said
holt
with
emphasis
that
one
of
the
things
he
do
excuse
my
rising
miss
lyon
said
felix
i
binding
up
finger
job
was
a
small
fellow
about
five
with
a
germinal
nose
large
round
blue
eyes
and
red
hair
that
curled
close
to
his
head
like
the
wool
on
the
back
of
an
infantine
lamb
he
had
evidently
been
crying
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
still
dolorous
felix
held
him
on
his
knee
as
he
bound
and
tied
up
very
cleverly
a
tiny
forefinger
there
was
a
table
in
front
of
felix
and
against
the
window
covered
with
his
watchmaking
implements
and
some
open
books
two
benches
stood
at
right
angles
on
the
sanded
floor
and
six
or
seven
boys
of
various
ages
up
to
twelve
were
getting
their
caps
and
preparing
to
go
home
they
huddled
themselves
together
and
stood
still
when
esther
entered
felix
could
not
look
up
till
he
had
finished
his
surgery
but
he
went
on
speaking
this
is
a
hero
miss
lyon
this
is
job
tudge
a
bold
briton
whose
finger
hurts
him
but
who
does
mean
to
cry
boys
lose
your
time
get
out
into
the
air
esther
seated
herself
on
the
end
of
the
bench
near
felix
much
relieved
that
job
was
the
immediate
object
of
attention
and
the
other
boys
rushed
out
behind
her
with
a
brief
chant
of
did
you
ever
see
said
holt
standing
to
look
on
how
wonderful
felix
is
at
that
small
work
with
his
large
fingers
and
that
because
he
learned
doctoring
it
is
for
want
of
cleverness
he
looks
like
a
poor
man
miss
lyon
i
left
off
speaking
else
i
should
say
it
a
sin
and
a
shame
illustration
felix
holt
and
job
tudge
mother
said
felix
who
often
amused
himself
and
kept
by
giving
his
mother
answers
that
were
unintelligible
to
her
you
have
an
astonishing
readiness
in
the
ciceronian
antiphrasis
considering
you
have
never
studied
oratory
there
job
thou
patient
man
sit
still
if
thou
wilt
and
now
we
can
look
at
miss
lyon
esther
had
taken
off
her
watch
and
was
holding
it
in
her
hand
but
he
looked
at
her
face
or
rather
at
her
eyes
as
he
said
you
want
me
to
doctor
your
watch
esther
expression
was
appealing
and
timid
as
it
had
never
been
before
in
felix
presence
but
when
she
saw
the
perfect
calmness
which
to
her
seemed
coldness
of
his
clear
gray
eyes
as
if
he
saw
no
reason
for
attaching
any
emphasis
to
this
first
meeting
a
pang
swift
as
an
electric
shock
darted
through
her
she
had
been
very
foolish
to
think
so
much
of
it
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
inferiority
to
felix
made
a
gulf
between
them
she
could
not
at
once
rally
her
pride
and
but
let
her
glance
fall
on
her
watch
and
said
rather
tremulously
it
loses
it
is
very
troublesome
it
has
been
losing
a
long
while
felix
took
the
watch
from
her
hand
then
looking
round
and
seeing
that
his
mother
was
gone
out
of
the
room
he
said
very
gently
you
look
distressed
miss
lyon
i
hope
there
is
no
trouble
at
home
felix
was
thinking
of
the
minister
agitation
on
the
previous
sunday
but
i
ought
perhaps
to
beg
your
pardon
for
saying
so
much
poor
esther
was
quite
helpless
the
mortification
which
had
come
like
a
bruise
to
all
the
sensibilities
that
had
been
in
keen
activity
insisted
on
some
relief
her
eyes
filled
instantly
and
a
great
tear
rolled
down
while
she
said
in
a
loud
sort
of
whisper
as
involuntary
as
her
tears
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
was
not
offended
that
i
am
not
ungenerous
i
thought
you
might
think
but
you
have
not
thought
of
it
was
there
ever
more
awkward
speaking
or
any
behavior
less
like
that
of
the
graceful
miss
lyon
whose
phrases
were
usually
so
well
turned
and
whose
repartees
were
so
ready
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
esther
had
her
two
little
hands
clasped
on
the
table
the
next
moment
she
felt
one
hand
of
felix
covering
them
both
and
pressing
them
firmly
but
he
did
not
speak
the
tears
were
both
on
her
cheeks
now
and
she
could
look
up
at
him
his
eyes
had
an
expression
of
sadness
in
them
quite
new
to
her
suddenly
little
job
who
had
his
mental
exercises
on
the
occasion
called
out
impatiently
she
tut
her
finger
felix
and
esther
laughed
and
drew
their
hands
away
and
as
esther
took
her
handkerchief
to
wipe
the
tears
from
her
cheeks
she
said
you
see
job
i
am
a
naughty
coward
i
ca
help
crying
when
i
hurt
myself
zoo
sood
kuy
said
job
energetically
being
much
impressed
with
a
moral
doctrine
which
had
come
to
him
after
a
sufficient
transgression
of
it
job
is
like
me
said
felix
fonder
of
preaching
than
of
practice
but
let
us
look
at
this
same
watch
he
went
on
opening
and
examining
it
these
little
geneva
toys
are
cleverly
constructed
to
go
always
a
little
wrong
but
if
you
wind
them
up
and
set
them
regularly
every
night
you
may
know
at
least
that
it
not
noon
when
the
hand
points
there
felix
chatted
that
esther
might
recover
herself
but
now
holt
came
back
and
apologized
you
excuse
my
going
away
i
know
miss
lyon
but
there
were
the
dumplings
to
see
to
and
what
little
i
got
left
on
my
hands
now
i
like
to
do
well
not
but
what
i
more
cleaning
to
do
than
ever
i
had
in
my
life
before
as
you
may
tell
soon
enough
if
you
look
at
this
floor
but
when
you
been
used
to
doing
things
and
they
been
taken
away
from
you
it
as
if
your
hands
had
been
cut
off
and
you
felt
the
fingers
as
are
of
no
use
to
you
that
a
great
image
mother
said
felix
as
he
snapped
the
watch
together
and
handed
it
to
esther
i
never
heard
you
use
such
an
image
before
yes
i
know
you
always
some
fault
to
find
with
what
your
mother
says
but
if
ever
there
was
a
woman
could
talk
with
the
open
bible
before
her
and
not
be
afraid
it
me
i
never
did
tell
stories
and
i
never
will
though
i
know
it
done
miss
lyon
and
by
church
members
too
when
they
have
candles
to
sell
as
i
could
bring
you
to
the
proof
but
i
never
was
one
of
let
felix
say
what
he
will
about
the
printing
on
the
tickets
his
father
believed
it
was
gospel
truth
and
it
presumptuous
to
say
it
was
for
as
for
curing
how
can
anybody
know
there
no
physic
cure
without
a
blessing
and
a
blessing
i
know
i
seen
a
mustard
plaister
work
when
there
was
no
more
smell
nor
strength
in
the
mustard
than
so
much
flour
and
reason
good
for
the
mustard
had
lain
in
paper
nobody
knows
how
long
so
leave
you
to
guess
holt
looked
hard
out
of
the
window
and
gave
a
slight
inarticulate
sound
of
scorn
felix
had
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
resigned
smile
and
was
pinching
job
ears
esther
said
i
think
i
had
better
go
now
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
yet
not
wishing
to
go
immediately
lest
she
should
seem
to
be
running
away
from
holt
she
felt
keenly
how
much
endurance
there
must
be
for
felix
and
she
had
often
been
discontented
with
her
father
and
called
him
tiresome
where
does
job
tudge
live
she
said
still
sitting
and
looking
at
the
droll
little
figure
set
off
by
a
ragged
jacket
with
a
tail
about
two
inches
deep
sticking
out
above
the
funniest
of
corduroys
job
has
two
mansions
said
felix
he
lives
here
chiefly
but
he
has
another
home
where
his
grandfather
tudge
the
lives
my
mother
is
very
good
to
job
miss
lyon
she
has
made
him
a
little
bed
in
a
cupboard
and
she
gives
him
sweetened
porridge
the
exquisite
goodness
implied
in
these
words
of
felix
impressed
esther
the
more
because
in
her
hearing
his
talk
had
usually
been
pungent
and
denunciatory
looking
at
holt
she
saw
that
her
eyes
had
lost
their
bleak
expression
and
were
shining
with
some
mildness
on
little
job
who
had
turned
round
toward
her
propping
his
head
against
felix
well
why
should
i
be
motherly
to
the
child
miss
lyon
said
holt
whose
strong
powers
of
argument
required
the
file
of
an
imagined
contradiction
if
there
were
no
real
one
at
hand
i
never
was
and
i
never
will
be
it
was
felix
picked
the
child
up
and
took
to
him
you
may
be
sure
for
there
nobody
else
master
where
he
is
but
i
was
going
to
beat
the
orphan
child
and
abuse
him
because
of
that
and
him
as
straight
as
an
arrow
when
he
stripped
and
me
so
fond
of
children
and
only
had
one
of
my
own
to
live
i
three
babies
miss
lyon
but
the
blessed
lord
only
spared
felix
and
him
the
masterfulest
and
brownest
of
all
but
i
did
my
duty
by
him
and
i
said
have
more
schooling
than
his
father
and
he
grow
up
a
doctor
and
marry
a
woman
with
money
to
furnish
as
i
was
myself
spoons
and
everything
and
i
shall
have
the
grandchildren
to
look
up
to
me
and
be
drove
out
in
the
gig
sometimes
like
old
lukyn
and
you
see
what
it
all
come
to
miss
lyon
here
felix
made
a
common
man
of
himself
and
says
he
never
be
married
which
is
the
most
unreasonable
thing
and
him
never
easy
but
when
he
got
the
child
on
his
lap
or
when
stop
stop
mother
felix
burst
in
pray
do
use
that
limping
argument
again
that
a
man
should
marry
because
he
fond
of
children
that
a
reason
for
not
marrying
a
bachelor
children
are
always
young
they
immortal
children
always
lisping
waddling
helpless
and
with
a
chance
of
turning
out
good
the
lord
above
may
know
what
you
mean
and
have
other
children
a
chance
of
turning
out
good
oh
they
grow
out
of
it
very
fast
here
job
tudge
now
said
felix
turning
the
little
one
round
on
his
knee
and
holding
his
head
by
the
back
job
limbs
will
get
lanky
this
little
fist
that
looks
like
a
and
can
hide
nothing
bigger
than
a
gooseberry
will
get
large
and
bony
and
perhaps
want
to
clutch
more
than
its
share
these
wide
blue
eyes
that
tell
me
more
truth
than
job
knows
will
narrow
and
narrow
and
try
to
hide
truth
that
job
would
be
better
without
knowing
this
little
negative
nose
will
become
long
and
and
this
little
tongue
put
out
thy
tongue

job
under
this
ceremony
put
out

timidly

and
thick

and

and
cut
as
cruelly
for
all
its
clumsiness
as
if
it
were
a
blade
big
job
will
perhaps
be
naughty
as
felix
speaking
with
the
loud
emphatic
distinctness
habitual
to
him
brought
out
this
terribly
familiar
word
job
sense
of
mystification
became
too
painful
he
hung
his
lip
and
began
to
cry
see
here
said
holt
you
frightening
the
innocent
child
with
such
talk
and
it
enough
to
frighten
them
that
think
themselves
the
safest
look
here
job
my
man
said
felix
setting
the
boy
down
and
turning
him
toward
esther
go
to
miss
lyon
ask
her
to
smile
at
you
and
that
will
dry
up
your
tears
like
the
sunshine
job
put
his
two
brown
fists
on
esther
lap
and
she
stooped
to
kiss
him
then
holding
his
face
between
her
hands
she
said
tell
holt
we
do
mean
to
be
naughty
job
he
should
believe
in
us
more
but
now
i
must
really
go
home
esther
rose
and
held
out
her
hand
to
holt
who
kept
it
while
she
said
a
little
to
esther
confusion
i
very
glad
it
took
your
fancy
to
come
here
sometimes
miss
lyon
i
know
you
thought
to
hold
your
head
high
but
i
speak
of
people
as
i
find
and
i
sure
anybody
had
need
be
humble
that
comes
where
there
a
floor
like
this
for
i
put
by
my
best
they
so
out
of
all
character
i
must
look
above
for
comfort
now
but
i
do
say
i
not
worthy
to
be
called
on
for
all
that
felix
had
risen
and
moved
toward
the
door
that
he
might
open
it
and
shield
esther
from
more
last
words
on
his
mother
part
mr
holt
will
lyon
like
for
me
to
sit
with
him
an
hour
this
evening
do
you
think
why
not
he
always
likes
to
see
you
then
i
will
come
she
a
very
straight
figure
said
holt
how
she
carries
herself
but
i
doubt
there
some
truth
in
what
our
people
say
if
she
wo
look
at
young
muscat
it
the
better
for
he
need
have
a
big
fortune
that
marries
her
that
true
mother
said
felix
sitting
down
snatching
up
little
job
and
finding
a
vent
for
some
unspeakable
feeling
in
the
pretence
of
worrying
him
esther
was
rather
melancholy
as
she
went
home
yet
happier
withal
than
she
had
been
for
many
days
before
she
thought
i
need
not
mind
having
shown
so
much
anxiety
about
his
opinion
he
is
too
to
mistake
our
mutual
position
he
is
quite
above
putting
a
false
interpretation
on
what
i
have
done
besides
he
had
not
thought
of
me
at
all
i
saw
that
plainly
enough
yet
he
was
very
kind
there
is
something
greater
and
better
in
him
than
i
had
imagined
his
behavior
to
his
mother
and
me
too
i
should
call
it
the
highest
gentlemanliness
only
it
seems
in
him
to
be
something
deeper
but
he
has
chosen
an
intolerable
life
though
i
suppose
if
i
had
a
mind
equal
to
his
and
if
he
loved
me
very
dearly
i
should
choose
the
same
life
esther
felt
that
she
had
prefixed
an
impossible
if
to
that
result
but
now
she
had
known
felix
her
conception
of
what
a
happy
love
must
be
had
become
like
a
dissolving
view
in
which
the
images
were
gradually
melting
into
new
forms
and
new
colors
the
favorite
byronic
heroes
were
beginning
to
look
like
last
night
decorations
seen
in
the
sober
dawn
so
fast
does
a
little
leaven
spread
within
us
so
incalculable
is
one
personality
on
another
behind
all
thoughts
like
an
unacknowledged
yet
constraining
presence
there
was
the
sense
that
if
felix
holt
were
to
love
her
her
life
would
be
exalted
into
something
quite
new
into
a
sort
of
difficult
blessedness
such
as
one
may
imagine
in
beings
who
are
conscious
of
painfully
growing
into
possession
of
higher
powers
it
was
quite
true
that
felix
had
not
thought
the
more
of
esther
because
of
that
sunday
afternoon
interview
which
had
shaken
her
mind
to
the
very
roots
he
had
avoided
intruding
on
lyon
without
special
reason
because
he
believed
the
minister
to
be
preoccupied
with
some
private
care
he
had
thought
a
great
deal
of
esther
with
a
mixture
of
strong
disapproval
and
strong
liking
which
both
together
made
a
feeling
the
reverse
of
indifference
but
he
was
not
going
to
let
her
have
any
influence
on
his
life
even
if
his
determination
had
not
been
fixed
he
would
have
believed
that
she
would
utterly
scorn
him
in
any
other
light
than
that
of
an
acquaintance
and
the
emotion
she
had
shown
did
not
change
that
belief
but
he
was
deeply
touched
by
this
manifestation
of
her
better
qualities
and
felt
that
there
was
a
new
tie
of
friendship
between
them
that
was
the
brief
history
felix
would
have
given
of
his
relation
to
esther
and
he
was
accustomed
to
observe
himself
but
very
close
and
diligent
looking
at
living
creatures
even
through
the
best
microscope
will
leave
room
for
new
and
contradictory
discoveries
felix
found
lyon
particularly
glad
to
talk
to
him
the
minister
had
never
yet
disburdened
himself
about
his
letter
to
philip
debarry
concerning
the
public
conference
and
as
by
this
time
he
had
all
the
heads
of
his
discussion
thoroughly
in
his
mind
it
was
agreeable
to
recite
them
as
well
as
to
express
his
regret
that
time
had
been
lost
by
debarry
absence
from
the
manor
which
had
prevented
the
immediate
fulfillment
of
his
pledge
i
do
see
how
he
can
fulfill
it
if
the
rector
refuses
said
felix
thinking
it
well
to
moderate
the
little
man
confidence
the
rector
is
of
a
spirit
that
will
not
incur
earthly
impeachment
and
he
can
not
refuse
what
is
necessary
to
his
nephew
honorable
discharge
of
an
obligation
said
lyon
my
young
friend
it
is
a
case
wherein
the
prearranged
conditions
tend
by
such
a
beautiful
fitness
to
the
issue
i
have
sought
that
i
should
have
forever
held
myself
a
traitor
to
my
charge
had
i
neglected
the
indication
chapter
xxiii
i
will
not
excuse
you
you
shall
not
be
excused
excuses
shall
not
be
admitted
there
no
excuse
shall
serve
you
shall
not
be
excused
when
philip
debarry
had
come
home
that
morning
and
read
the
letters
which
had
not
been
forwarded
to
him
he
laughed
so
heartily
at
lyon
that
he
congratulated
himself
on
being
in
his
private
room
otherwise
his
laughter
would
have
awakened
the
curiosity
of
sir
maximus
and
philip
did
not
wish
to
tell
any
one
the
contents
of
the
letter
until
he
had
shown
them
to
his
uncle
he
determined
to
ride
over
to
the
rectory
to
lunch
for
as
lady
mary
was
away
he
and
his
uncle
might
be
the
rectory
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
close
to
the
church
of
which
it
was
the
fitting
companion
a
fine
old
house
with
a
great
opening
from
the
library
on
to
the
lawn
one
fat
dog
sleeping
on
the
another
fat
dog
waddling
on
the
gravel
the
autumn
leaves
duly
swept
away
the
lingering
chrysanthemums
cherished
tall
trees
stooping
or
soaring
in
the
most
picturesque
variety
and
a
virginian
creeper
turning
a
little
rustic
hut
into
a
scarlet
pavilion
it
was
one
of
those
rectories
which
are
among
the
bulwarks
of
our
venerable
institutions
which
arrest
disintegrating
doubt
serve
as
a
double
embankment
against
popery
and
dissent
and
rally
feminine
instinct
and
affection
to
reinforce
the
decisions
of
masculine
thought
what
makes
you
look
so
merry
phil
said
the
rector
as
his
nephew
entered
the
pleasant
library
something
that
concerns
you
said
philip
taking
out
the
letter
a
clerical
challenge
here
an
opportunity
for
you
to
emulate
the
divines
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
have
a
theological
duel
read
this
letter
what
answer
have
you
sent
the
crazy
little
fellow
said
the
rector
keeping
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
running
over
it
again
and
again
with
brow
knit
but
eyes
gleaming
without
any
malignity
oh
i
sent
no
answer
i
awaited
yours
mine
said
the
rector
throwing
down
the
letter
on
the
table
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
hold
a
public
debate
with
a
schismatic
of
that
sort
i
should
have
an
infidel
shoemaker
next
expecting
me
to
answer
blasphemies
delivered
in
bad
grammar
but
you
see
how
he
puts
it
said
philip
with
all
his
gravity
of
nature
he
could
not
resist
a
slightly
mischievous
prompting
though
he
had
a
serious
feeling
that
he
should
not
like
to
be
regarded
as
failing
to
fulfill
his
pledge
i
think
if
you
refuse
i
shall
be
obliged
to
offer
myself
nonsense
tell
him
he
is
himself
acting
a
dishonorable
part
in
interpreting
your
words
as
a
pledge
to
do
any
preposterous
thing
that
suits
his
fancy
suppose
he
had
asked
you
to
give
him
land
to
build
a
chapel
on
doubtless
that
would
have
given
him
a
satisfaction
a
man
who
puts
a
strained
sense
on
a
promise
is
no
better
than
a
robber
but
he
has
not
asked
for
land
i
dare
say
he
thinks
you
wo
object
to
his
proposal
i
confess
there
a
simplicity
and
quaintness
about
the
letter
that
rather
pleases
me
let
me
tell
you
phil
he
a
crazy
little
firefly
that
does
a
great
deal
of
harm
in
my
parish
he
inflames
the
dissenters
minds
on
politics
there
no
end
to
the
mischief
done
by
these
busy
prating
men
they
make
the
ignorant
multitude
the
judges
of
the
largest
questions
both
political
and
religious
till
we
shall
soon
have
no
institution
left
that
is
not
on
a
level
with
the
comprehension
of
a
huckster
or
a
drayman
there
can
be
nothing
more
retrograde
losing
all
the
results
of
civilization
all
the
lessons
of
providence
letting
the
windlass
run
down
after
men
have
been
turning
at
it
painfully
for
generations
if
the
instructed
are
not
to
judge
for
the
uninstructed
why
let
us
set
dick
stubbs
to
make
our
almanacs
and
have
a
president
of
the
royal
society
elected
by
universal
suffrage
the
rector
had
risen
placed
himself
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
ready
to
insist
further
on
this
wide
argument
philip
sat
nursing
one
leg
listening
respectfully
as
he
always
did
though
often
listening
to
the
sonorous
echo
of
his
own
statements
which
suited
his
uncle
needs
so
exactly
that
he
did
not
distinguish
them
from
his
own
impressions
true
said
philip
but
in
special
cases
we
have
to
do
with
special
conditions
you
know
i
defend
the
casuists
and
it
may
happen
that
for
the
honor
of
the
church
in
treby
and
a
little
also
for
my
honor
circumstances
may
demand
a
concession
even
to
some
notions
of
a
dissenting
preacher
not
at
all
i
should
be
making
a
figure
which
my
brother
clergy
might
well
take
as
an
affront
to
themselves
the
character
of
the
establishment
has
suffered
enough
already
through
the
evangelicals
with
their
extempore
incoherence
and
their
piety
look
at
wimple
the
man
who
is
vicar
of
shuttleton
without
his
gown
and
bands
anybody
would
take
him
for
a
grocer
in
mourning
well
i
shall
cut
a
still
worse
figure
and
so
will
you
in
the
dissenting
magazines
and
newspapers
it
will
go
the
round
of
the
kingdom
there
will
be
a
paragraph
headed
falsehood
and
clerical
cowardice
or
else
meanness
of
the
aristocracy
and
the
incompetence
of
the
beneficed
clergy
there
would
be
a
worse
paragraph
if
i
were
to
consent
to
the
debate
of
course
it
would
be
said
that
i
was
beaten
hollow
and
that
now
the
question
had
been
cleared
up
at
treba
magna
the
church
had
not
a
sound
leg
to
stand
on
besides
the
rector
went
on
frowning
and
smiling
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
phil
but
this
debating
is
not
so
easy
when
a
man
close
upon
sixty
what
one
writes
or
says
must
be
something
good
and
scholarly
and
after
all
had
been
done
this
little
lyon
would
buzz
about
one
like
a
wasp
and
and
rejoin
let
me
tell
you
a
plain
truth
may
be
so
worried
and
mauled
by
fallacies
as
to
get
the
worst
of
it
there
no
such
thing
as
tiring
a
like
lyon
then
you
absolutely
refuse
yes
i
do
you
remember
that
when
i
wrote
my
letter
of
thanks
to
lyon
you
approved
my
offer
to
serve
him
if
possible
certainly
i
remember
it
but
suppose
he
had
asked
you
to
vote
for
civil
marriage
or
to
go
and
hear
him
preach
every
sunday
but
he
has
not
asked
that
something
as
unreasonable
though
well
said
philip
taking
up
lyon
letter
and
looking
graver
looking
even
vexed
it
is
rather
an
unpleasant
business
for
me
i
really
felt
obliged
to
him
i
think
there
a
sort
of
worth
in
the
man
beyond
his
class
whatever
may
be
the
reason
of
the
case
i
shall
disappoint
him
instead
of
doing
him
the
service
i
offered
well
that
a
misfortune
we
ca
help
it
the
worst
of
it
is
i
should
be
insulting
him
to
say
will
do
anything
else
but
not
just
this
that
you
want
he
evidently
feels
himself
in
company
with
luther
and
zwingle
and
calvin
and
considers
our
letters
part
of
the
history
of
protestantism
yes
yes
i
know
it
rather
an
unpleasant
thing
phil
you
are
aware
that
i
would
have
done
anything
in
reason
to
prevent
you
from
becoming
unpopular
here
i
consider
your
character
a
possession
to
all
of
us
i
think
i
must
call
on
him
forthwith
and
explain
and
apologize
no
sit
still
i
thought
of
something
said
the
rector
with
a
sudden
revival
of
spirits
i
just
seen
sherlock
coming
in
he
is
to
lunch
with
me
it
would
do
no
harm
for
him
to
hold
the
debate
a
curate
and
a
young
man
he
gain
by
it
and
it
would
release
you
from
any
awkwardness
phil
sherlock
is
not
going
to
stay
here
long
you
know
he
soon
have
his
title
i
put
the
thing
to
him
he
object
if
i
wish
it
it
a
capital
idea
it
will
do
sherlock
good
a
clever
fellow
but
he
wants
confidence
philip
had
not
time
to
object
before
sherlock
appeared
a
young
divine
of
good
birth
and
figure
of
sallow
complexion
and
bashful
address
sherlock
you
have
come
in
most
opportunely
said
the
rector
a
case
has
turned
up
in
the
parish
in
which
you
can
be
of
eminent
use
i
know
that
is
what
you
have
desired
ever
since
you
have
been
with
me
but
about
so
much
myself
that
there
really
has
not
been
sphere
enough
for
you
you
are
a
studious
man
i
know
i
dare
say
you
have
all
the
necessary
matter
prepared
at
your
if
not
on
paper
sherlock
smiled
with
rather
a
trembling
lip
willing
to
distinguish
himself
but
hoping
that
the
rector
only
alluded
to
a
dialogue
on
baptism
by
aspersion
or
some
other
pamphlet
suited
to
the
purposes
of
the
christian
knowledge
society
but
as
the
rector
proceeded
to
unfold
the
circumstances
under
which
his
eminent
service
was
to
be
rendered
he
grew
more
and
more
nervous
you
oblige
me
very
much
sherlock
the
rector
ended
by
going
into
this
thing
zealously
can
you
guess
what
time
you
will
require
because
it
will
rest
with
us
to
fix
the
day
i
should
be
rejoiced
to
oblige
you
debarry
but
i
really
think
i
am
not
competent
to
that
your
modesty
sherlock
do
let
me
hear
any
more
of
that
i
know
filmore
of
corpus
said
you
might
be
a
man
if
your
diffidence
did
do
you
injustice
and
you
can
refer
anything
to
me
you
know
come
you
will
set
about
the
thing
at
once
but
phil
you
must
tell
the
preacher
to
send
a
scheme
of
the
debate
all
the
different
heads
and
he
must
agree
to
keep
rigidly
within
the
scheme
there
sit
down
at
my
desk
and
write
the
letter
now
thomas
shall
carry
it
philip
sat
down
to
write
and
the
rector
with
his
firm
ringing
voice
went
on
at
his
ease
giving
indications
to
his
agitated
curate
but
you
can
begin
at
once
preparing
a
good
cogent
clear
statement
and
considering
the
probable
points
of
assault
you
can
look
into
jewel
hall
hooker
whitgift
and
the
rest
you
find
them
all
here
my
library
wants
nothing
in
english
divinity
sketch
the
lower
ground
taken
by
usher
and
those
men
but
bring
all
your
force
to
bear
on
marking
out
the
true
doctrine
expose
the
wretched
cavils
of
the
noncomformists
and
the
noisy
futility
that
belongs
to
schismatics
generally
i
will
give
you
a
telling
passage
from
burke
on
the
dissenters
and
some
good
quotations
which
i
brought
together
in
two
sermons
of
my
own
on
the
position
of
the
english
church
in
christendom
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
take
you
to
bring
your
thoughts
together
you
can
throw
them
afterward
into
the
form
of
an
essay
we
have
the
thing
printed
it
will
do
you
good
with
the
bishop
with
all
sherlock
timidity
there
was
fascination
for
him
in
this
distinction
he
reflected
that
he
could
take
coffee
and
sit
up
late
and
perhaps
produce
something
rather
fine
it
might
be
a
first
step
toward
that
eminence
which
it
was
no
more
than
his
duty
to
aspire
to
even
a
polemical
fame
like
that
of
a
philpotts
must
have
had
a
beginning
sherlock
was
not
insensible
to
the
pleasure
of
turning
sentences
successfully
and
it
was
a
pleasure
not
always
unconnected
with
preferment
a
diffident
man
likes
the
idea
of
doing
something
remarkable
which
will
create
belief
in
him
without
any
immediate
display
of
brilliancy
celebrity
may
blush
and
be
silent
and
win
a
grace
the
more
thus
sherlock
was
constrained
trembling
all
the
while
and
much
wishing
that
his
essay
were
already
in
print
i
think
i
could
hardly
be
ready
under
a
fortnight
very
good
just
write
that
phil
and
tell
him
to
fix
the
precise
day
and
place
and
then
we
go
to
lunch
the
rector
was
quite
satisfied
he
had
talked
himself
into
thinking
that
he
should
like
to
give
sherlock
a
few
useful
hints
look
up
his
own
earlier
sermons
and
benefit
the
curate
by
his
criticism
when
the
argument
had
been
got
into
shape
he
was
a
man
but
that
was
not
at
all
a
reason
why
he
should
not
have
those
sensibilities
to
the
odor
of
authorship
which
belong
to
almost
everybody
who
is
not
expected
to
be
a
writer
and
especially
to
that
form
of
authorship
which
is
called
suggestion
and
consists
in
telling
another
man
that
he
might
do
a
great
deal
with
a
given
subject
by
bringing
a
sufficient
amount
of
knowledge
reasoning
and
wit
to
bear
upon
it
philip
would
have
had
some
twinges
of
conscience
about
the
curate
if
he
had
not
guessed
that
the
honor
thrust
upon
him
was
not
altogether
disagreeable
the
church
might
perhaps
have
had
a
stronger
supporter
but
for
himself
he
had
done
what
he
was
bound
to
do
he
had
done
his
best
toward
fulfilling
lyon
desire
chapter
xxiv
if
he
come
not
the
play
is
night
rufus
lyon
was
very
happy
on
that
mild
november
morning
appointed
for
the
great
conference
in
the
larger
room
at
the
free
school
between
himself
and
the
reverend
theodore
sherlock
the
disappointment
of
not
contending
with
the
rector
in
person
which
had
at
first
been
bitter
had
been
gradually
lost
sight
of
in
the
positive
enjoyment
of
an
opportunity
for
debating
on
any
terms
lyon
had
two
grand
elements
of
pleasure
on
such
occasions
confidence
in
the
strength
of
his
case
and
confidence
in
his
own
power
of
advocacy
not
to
use
his
own
phrase
not
that
he
glorified
himself
herein
for
speech
and
exposition
were
so
easy
to
him
that
if
he
argued
forcibly
he
believed
it
to
be
simply
because
the
truth
was
forcible
he
was
not
proud
of
moving
easily
in
his
native
medium
a
panting
man
thinks
of
himself
as
a
clever
swimmer
but
a
fish
swims
much
better
and
takes
his
performance
as
a
matter
of
course
whether
sherlock
were
that
panting
man
remained
a
secret
philip
debarry
much
occupied
with
his
electioneering
affairs
had
only
once
had
an
opportunity
of
asking
his
uncle
how
sherlock
got
on
and
the
rector
had
said
curtly
i
think
he
do
i
supplied
him
well
with
references
i
advise
him
to
read
only
and
decline
everything
else
as
out
of
order
lyon
will
speak
to
a
point
and
then
sherlock
will
read
it
will
be
all
the
more
telling
it
will
give
variety
but
on
this
particular
morning
peremptory
business
connected
with
the
magistracy
called
the
rector
away
due
notice
had
been
given
and
the
feminine
world
of
treby
magna
was
much
more
agitated
by
the
prospect
than
by
that
of
any
speech
pendrell
at
the
bank
tiliot
and
the
church
ladies
generally
felt
bound
to
hear
the
curate
who
was
known
apparently
by
an
intuition
concerning
the
nature
of
curates
to
be
a
very
clever
young
man
and
he
would
show
them
what
learning
had
to
say
on
the
right
side
one
or
two
dissenting
ladies
were
not
without
emotion
at
the
thought
that
seated
on
the
front
benches
they
should
be
brought
near
to
old
church
friends
and
have
a
longer
greeting
than
had
taken
place
since
the
catholic
emancipation
muscat
who
had
been
a
beauty
and
was
as
nice
in
her
millinery
as
any
trebian
lady
belonging
to
the
establishment
reflected
that
she
should
put
on
her
best
embroidered
collar
and
that
she
should
ask
tiliot
where
it
was
in
duffield
that
she
once
got
her
dyed
so
beautifully
when
tiliot
was
mary
salt
the
two
ladies
had
been
bosom
friends
but
tiliot
looked
higher
and
higher
since
his
gin
had
become
so
famous
and
in
the
year
he
had
in
muscat
hearing
spoken
of
dissenters
as
sneaks
a
personality
which
could
not
be
overlooked
the
debate
was
to
begin
at
eleven
for
the
rector
would
not
allow
the
evening
to
be
chosen
when
low
men
and
boys
might
want
to
be
admitted
out
of
mere
mischief
this
was
one
reason
why
the
female
part
of
the
audience
outnumbered
the
males
but
some
chief
trebians
were
there
even
men
whose
means
made
them
as
independent
of
theory
as
pendrell
and
wace
encouraged
by
reflecting
that
they
were
not
in
a
place
of
worship
and
would
not
be
obliged
to
stay
longer
than
they
chose
there
was
a
muster
of
all
dissenters
who
could
spare
the
morning
time
and
on
the
back
benches
were
all
the
aged
churchwomen
who
shared
the
remnants
of
the
sacrament
wine
and
who
were
humbly
anxious
to
neglect
nothing
ecclesiastical
or
connected
with
going
to
a
better
place
at
eleven
the
arrival
of
listeners
seemed
to
have
ceased
lyon
was
seated
on
the
school
tribune
or
dais
at
his
particular
round
table
another
round
table
with
a
chair
awaited
the
curate
with
whose
superior
position
it
was
quite
in
keeping
that
he
should
not
be
the
first
on
the
ground
a
couple
of
extra
chairs
were
placed
farther
back
and
more
than
one
important
personage
had
been
requested
to
act
as
chairman
but
no
churchman
would
place
himself
in
a
position
so
equivocal
as
to
dignity
of
aspect
and
so
unequivocal
as
to
the
obligation
of
sitting
out
the
discussion
and
the
rector
had
beforehand
put
a
veto
on
any
dissenting
chairman
lyon
sat
patiently
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
with
his
notes
in
minute
handwriting
lying
before
him
seeming
to
look
at
the
audience
but
not
seeing
them
every
one
else
was
contented
that
there
should
be
an
interval
in
which
there
could
be
a
little
neighborly
talk
esther
was
particularly
happy
seated
on
a
near
her
side
of
the
tribune
with
felix
close
behind
her
so
that
she
could
turn
her
head
and
talk
to
him
he
had
been
very
kind
ever
since
that
morning
when
she
had
called
at
his
home
more
disposed
to
listen
indulgently
to
what
she
had
to
say
and
less
blind
to
her
looks
and
movements
if
he
had
never
railed
at
her
or
ignored
her
she
would
have
been
less
sensitive
to
the
attention
he
gave
her
but
as
it
was
the
prospect
of
seeing
him
seemed
to
light
up
her
life
and
to
disperse
the
old
dullness
she
looked
unusually
charming
from
the
very
fact
that
she
was
not
vividly
conscious
of
anything
but
of
having
a
mind
near
her
that
asked
her
to
be
something
better
than
she
actually
was
the
consciousness
of
her
own
superiority
amongst
the
people
around
her
was
superseded
and
even
a
few
brief
weeks
had
given
a
softened
expression
to
her
eyes
a
more
feminine
beseechingness
and
to
her
manners
perhaps
however
a
little
new
defiance
was
rising
in
place
of
the
old
contempt
defiance
of
the
trebian
views
about
felix
holt
what
a
very
young
woman
your
minister
daughter
is
said
tiliot
in
an
undertone
to
muscat
who
as
she
had
hoped
had
found
a
seat
next
her
quondam
friend
quite
the
lady
rather
too
much
so
considering
said
muscat
she
thought
proud
and
that
is
not
pretty
in
a
girl
even
if
there
was
anything
to
back
it
up
but
now
she
seems
to
be
encouraging
that
young
holt
who
scoffs
at
everything
as
you
may
judge
by
his
appearance
she
has
despised
his
betters
before
now
but
i
leave
you
to
judge
whether
a
young
man
who
has
taken
to
low
ways
of
getting
a
living
can
pay
for
fine
cambric
handkerchiefs
and
light
kid
gloves
muscat
lowered
her
blonde
eyelashes
and
swayed
her
neat
head
just
perceptibly
from
side
to
side
with
a
sincere
desire
to
be
moderate
in
her
expressions
notwithstanding
any
shock
that
facts
might
have
given
her
dear
dear
said
tiliot
what
that
is
young
holt
leaning
forward
now
without
a
cravat
i
never
seen
him
before
to
notice
him
but
i
heard
tiliot
talking
about
him
they
say
he
a
dangerous
character
and
goes
stirring
up
the
workingmen
at
sproxton
and
well
to
be
sure
such
great
eyes
and
such
a
great
head
of
hair
it
is
enough
to
frighten
one
what
can
she
see
in
him
quite
below
her
yes
and
brought
up
a
governess
said
muscat
you
have
thought
she
knowed
better
how
to
choose
but
the
minister
has
let
her
get
the
upper
hand
sadly
too
much
it
a
pity
in
a
man
of
god
i
do
deny
he
well
i
am
sorry
said
tiliot
for
i
meant
her
to
give
my
girls
lessons
when
they
came
from
school
wace
and
pendrell
meanwhile
were
standing
up
and
looking
round
at
the
audience
nodding
to
their
with
the
affability
due
from
men
in
their
position
it
time
he
came
now
said
wace
looking
at
his
watch
and
comparing
it
with
the
schoolroom
clock
this
debating
is
a
sort
of
thing
but
the
rector
would
never
have
given
in
to
it
if
there
had
been
good
reasons
nolan
said
he
would
come
he
says
this
debating
is
an
atheistical
sort
of
thing
the
atheists
are
very
fond
of
it
theirs
is
a
bad
book
to
take
a
leaf
out
of
however
we
shall
hear
nothing
but
what
good
from
sherlock
he
preaches
a
capital
sermon
for
such
a
young
man
well
it
was
our
duty
to
support
him
not
to
leave
him
alone
among
the
dissenters
said
pendrell
you
see
everybody
has
felt
that
labron
might
have
shown
himself
if
not
lukyn
i
could
have
alleged
business
myself
if
i
had
thought
proper
here
he
comes
i
think
said
wace
turning
round
on
hearing
a
movement
near
the
small
door
on
a
level
with
the
platform
by
george
it
debarry
come
now
this
is
handsome
wace
and
pendrell
clapped
their
hands
and
the
example
was
followed
even
by
most
of
the
dissenters
philip
was
aware
that
he
was
doing
a
popular
thing
of
a
kind
that
treby
was
not
used
to
from
the
elder
debarrys
but
his
appearance
had
not
been
long
premeditated
he
was
driving
through
the
town
toward
an
engagement
at
some
distance
but
on
calling
at
labron
office
he
had
found
that
the
affair
which
demanded
his
presence
had
been
deferred
and
so
had
driven
round
to
the
free
school
christian
came
in
behind
him
lyon
was
now
roused
from
his
abstraction
and
stepping
from
his
slight
elevation
begged
debarry
to
act
as
moderator
or
president
on
the
occasion
with
all
my
heart
said
philip
but
sherlock
has
not
arrived
apparently
he
tarries
somewhat
unduly
said
lyon
nevertheless
there
may
be
a
reason
of
which
we
know
not
shall
i
collect
the
thoughts
of
the
assembly
by
a
brief
introductory
address
in
the
interval
no
no
no
said
wace
who
saw
a
limit
to
his
powers
of
endurance
sherlock
is
sure
to
be
here
in
a
minute
or
two
christian
said
philip
debarry
who
felt
a
slight
misgiving
just
be
so
good
but
stay
i
go
myself
excuse
me
gentlemen
i
drive
round
to
sherlock
lodgings
he
may
be
under
a
little
mistake
as
to
the
time
studious
men
are
sometimes
rather
you
come
with
me
christian
as
debarry
went
out
rufus
lyon
stepped
on
to
the
tribune
again
in
rather
an
uneasy
state
of
mind
a
few
ideas
had
occurred
to
him
eminently
fitted
to
engage
the
audience
profitably
and
so
to
wrest
some
edification
out
of
an
unforeseen
delay
but
his
native
delicacy
made
him
feel
that
in
this
assembly
the
church
people
might
fairly
decline
any
deliverance
on
his
part
which
exceeded
the
programme
and
negative
had
been
energetic
but
the
little
man
suffered
from
imprisoned
ideas
and
was
as
restless
as
a
racer
held
in
he
could
not
sit
down
again
but
walked
backward
and
forward
stroking
his
chin
emitting
his
low
guttural
interjections
under
the
pressure
of
clauses
and
sentences
which
he
longed
to
utter
aloud
as
he
would
have
done
in
his
own
study
there
was
a
low
buzz
in
the
room
which
helped
to
deepen
the
sense
that
the
thoughts
within
him
were
as
divine
messengers
unheeded
or
rejected
by
a
trivial
generation
many
of
the
audience
were
standing
all
except
the
old
churchwomen
on
the
back
seats
and
a
few
devout
dissenters
who
kept
their
eyes
shut
and
gave
their
bodies
a
gentle
oscillating
motion
were
interested
in
chat
your
father
is
uneasy
said
felix
to
esther
yes
and
now
i
think
he
is
feeling
for
his
spectacles
i
hope
he
has
not
left
them
at
home
he
will
not
be
able
to
see
anything
two
yards
before
him
without
them
and
it
makes
him
so
unconscious
of
what
people
expect
or
want
i
go
and
ask
him
whether
he
has
them
said
felix
striding
over
the
form
in
front
of
him
and
approaching
lyon
whose
face
showed
a
gleam
of
pleasure
at
this
relief
from
his
abstracted
isolation
miss
lyon
is
afraid
that
you
are
at
a
loss
for
your
spectacles
sir
said
felix
my
dear
young
friend
said
lyon
laying
his
hand
on
felix
which
was
about
on
a
level
with
the
minister
shoulder
it
is
a
very
glorious
truth
albeit
made
somewhat
painful
to
me
by
the
circumstances
of
the
present
moment
that
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
brevity
of
our
mortal
life
wherein
as
i
apprehend
our
powers
are
being
trained
not
only
for
the
transmission
of
an
improved
heritage
as
i
have
heard
you
insist
but
also
for
our
own
entrance
into
a
higher
initiation
in
the
divine
scheme
it
is
i
say
a
very
glorious
truth
that
even
in
what
are
called
the
waste
minutes
of
our
time
like
those
of
expectation
the
soul
may
soar
and
range
as
in
some
of
our
dreams
which
are
brief
as
a
broken
rainbow
in
duration
yet
seem
to
comprise
a
long
history
of
terror
or
joy
and
again
each
moment
may
be
a
beginning
of
a
new
spiritual
energy
and
our
pulse
would
doubtless
be
a
coarse
and
clumsy
notation
of
the
passage
from
that
which
was
not
to
that
which
is
even
in
the
finer
processes
of
the
material
world
and
how
much
more
esther
was
watching
her
father
and
felix
and
though
she
was
not
within
hearing
of
what
was
being
said
she
guessed
the
actual
state
of
the
case
that
the
enquiry
about
the
spectacles
had
been
unheeded
and
that
her
father
was
losing
himself
and
embarrassing
felix
in
the
intricacies
of
a
dissertation
there
was
not
the
stillness
around
her
that
would
have
made
a
movement
on
her
part
seem
conspicuous
and
she
was
impelled
by
her
anxiety
to
step
on
the
tribune
and
walk
up
to
her
father
who
paused
a
little
startled
pray
see
whether
you
have
forgotten
your
spectacles
father
if
so
i
will
go
home
at
once
and
look
for
them
lyon
was
automatically
obedient
to
esther
and
he
began
immediately
to
feel
in
his
pockets
how
is
it
that
miss
jermyn
is
so
friendly
with
the
dissenting
parson
said
christian
to
quorlen
the
tory
printer
who
was
an
intimate
of
his
those
grand
jermyns
are
not
dissenters
surely
miss
jermyn
why
do
you
see
that
fine
girl
who
is
talking
to
him
miss
jermyn
why
that
the
little
parson
daughter
his
daughter
christian
gave
a
low
brief
whistle
which
seemed
a
natural
expression
of
surprise
that
the
rusty
old
ranter
should
have
a
daughter
of
such
distinguished
appearance
meanwhile
the
search
for
the
spectacles
had
proved
vain
is
a
grievous
fault
in
me
my
dear
said
the
little
man
humbly
i
become
thereby
sadly
burdensome
to
you
i
will
go
at
once
said
esther
refusing
to
let
felix
go
instead
of
her
but
she
had
scarcely
stepped
off
the
tribune
when
debarry
and
there
was
a
commotion
which
made
her
wait
after
a
conversation
with
pendrell
and
wace
philip
debarry
stepped
on
to
the
tribune
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
said
with
an
air
of
much
concern
and
annoyance
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
that
doubtless
owing
to
some
accidental
cause
which
i
trust
will
soon
be
explained
as
nothing
serious
sherlock
is
absent
from
his
residence
and
is
not
to
be
found
he
went
out
early
his
landlady
informs
me
to
refresh
himself
by
a
walk
on
this
agreeable
morning
as
is
his
habit
she
tells
me
when
he
has
been
kept
up
late
by
study
and
he
has
not
returned
do
not
let
us
be
too
anxious
i
shall
cause
enquiry
to
be
made
in
the
direction
of
his
walk
it
is
easy
to
imagine
many
accidents
not
of
a
grave
character
by
which
he
might
nevertheless
be
absolutely
detained
against
his
will
under
these
circumstances
lyon
continued
philip
turning
to
the
minister
i
presume
that
the
debate
must
be
adjourned
the
debate
doubtless
began
lyon
but
his
farther
speech
was
drowned
by
a
general
rising
of
the
church
people
from
their
seats
many
of
them
feeling
that
even
if
the
cause
were
lamentable
the
adjournment
was
not
altogether
disagreeable
good
gracious
me
said
tiliot
as
she
took
her
husband
arm
i
hope
the
poor
young
man
has
fallen
into
the
river
or
broken
his
leg
but
some
of
the
more
acrid
dissenters
whose
temper
was
not
controlled
by
the
habits
of
retail
business
had
begun
to
hiss
implying
that
in
their
interpretation
the
curate
absence
had
not
depended
on
any
injury
to
life
or
limb
he
turned
tail
sure
enough
said
muscat
to
the
neighbor
behind
him
lifting
his
eyebrows
and
shoulders
and
laughing
in
a
way
that
showed
that
deacon
as
he
was
he
looked
at
the
affair
in
an
entirely
secular
light
but
muscat
thought
it
would
be
nothing
but
right
to
have
all
the
waters
dragged
agreeing
in
this
with
the
majority
of
the
church
ladies
i
regret
sincerely
lyon
said
philip
debarry
addressing
the
minister
with
politeness
that
i
must
say
to
you
with
the
sense
that
i
have
not
been
able
at
present
to
contribute
to
your
satisfaction
as
i
had
wished
speak
not
of
it
in
the
way
of
apology
sir
said
lyon
in
a
tone
of
depression
i
doubt
not
that
you
yourself
have
acted
in
good
faith
nor
will
i
open
any
door
of
egress
to
constructions
such
as
anger
often
deems
ingenious
but
which
the
disclosure
of
the
simple
truth
may
expose
as
erroneous
and
uncharitable
fabrications
i
wish
you
sir
when
the
room
was
cleared
of
the
church
people
lyon
wished
to
soothe
his
own
spirit
and
that
of
his
flock
by
a
few
reflections
introductory
to
a
parting
prayer
but
there
was
a
general
resistance
to
this
effort
the
men
mustered
round
the
minister
and
declared
their
opinion
that
the
whole
thing
was
disgraceful
to
the
church
some
said
that
the
curate
absence
had
been
contrived
from
the
first
others
more
than
hinted
that
it
had
been
a
folly
in
lyon
to
set
on
foot
any
procedure
in
common
with
tories
and
clergymen
who
if
they
ever
aped
civility
to
dissenters
would
never
do
anything
but
laugh
at
them
in
their
sleeves
brother
kemp
urged
in
his
heavy
bass
that
lyon
should
lose
no
time
in
sending
an
account
of
the
affair
to
the
and
brother
hawkins
in
his
high
tenor
observed
that
it
was
an
occasion
on
which
some
stinging
things
might
be
said
with
all
the
extra
effect
of
an
the
position
of
receiving
a
lecture
from
the
members
of
his
church
was
familiar
to
lyon
but
now
he
felt
weary
frustrated
and
doubtful
of
his
own
temper
felix
who
stood
by
and
saw
that
this
man
of
sensitive
fibre
was
suffering
from
talkers
whose
noisy
superficiality
cost
them
nothing
got
exasperated
it
seems
to
me
sirs
he
burst
in
with
his
predominant
voice
that
lyon
has
hitherto
had
the
hard
part
of
the
business
while
you
of
his
congregation
have
had
the
easy
one
punish
the
church
clergy
if
you
like
they
can
take
care
of
themselves
but
do
punish
your
own
minister
it
no
business
of
mine
perhaps
except
so
far
as
is
everybody
business
but
it
seems
to
me
the
time
to
ask
lyon
to
take
a
little
rest
instead
of
setting
on
him
like
so
many
wasps
by
this
speech
felix
raised
a
displeasure
which
fell
on
the
minister
as
well
as
on
himself
but
he
gained
his
immediate
end
the
talkers
dropped
off
after
a
slight
show
of
persistence
and
lyon
quitted
the
field
of
no
combat
with
a
small
group
of
his
less
imperious
friends
to
whom
he
confided
his
intention
of
committing
his
argument
fully
to
paper
and
forwarding
it
to
a
discriminating
editor
but
regarding
personalities
he
added
i
have
not
the
same
clear
showing
for
say
that
this
young
man
was
pusillanimous
i
were
but
with
arguments
if
i
took
my
stand
even
for
a
moment
on
so
poor
an
irrelevancy
as
that
because
one
curate
is
ill
furnished
therefore
episcopacy
is
false
if
i
held
up
any
one
to
just
obloquy
it
would
be
the
incumbent
of
this
parish
who
calling
himself
one
of
the
church
militant
sends
a
young
and
substitute
to
take
his
place
in
the
fight
philip
debarry
did
not
neglect
to
make
industrious
enquiry
concerning
the
accidents
which
had
detained
the
reverend
theodore
sherlock
on
his
morning
walk
that
young
divine
was
seen
no
more
in
treby
magna
but
the
river
was
not
dragged
for
by
the
evening
coach
the
rector
received
an
explanatory
letter
the
reverend
theodore
agitation
had
increased
so
much
during
his
walk
that
the
passing
coach
had
been
a
means
of
deliverance
not
to
be
resisted
and
literally
at
the
eleventh
hour
he
had
hailed
and
mounted
the
cheerful
and
carried
away
his
portion
of
the
debate
in
his
pocket
but
the
rector
had
subsequently
the
satisfaction
of
receiving
sherlock
painstaking
production
in
print
with
a
dedication
to
the
reverend
augustus
debarry
a
motto
from
chrysostom
and
other
additions
the
fruit
of
ripening
leisure
he
was
sorry
for
poor
sherlock
who
wanted
confidence
but
he
was
convinced
that
for
his
own
part
he
had
taken
the
course
which
under
the
circumstances
was
the
least
compromising
to
the
church
sir
maximus
however
observed
to
his
son
and
brother
that
he
had
been
right
and
they
had
been
wrong
as
to
the
danger
of
vague
enormous
expressions
of
gratitude
to
a
dissenting
preacher
and
on
any
differences
of
opinion
seldom
failed
to
remind
them
of
that
precedent
chapter
xxv
your
divide
the
epithet
say
rather
you
the
fellow
he
the
man
when
christian
quitted
the
free
school
with
the
discovery
that
the
young
lady
whose
appearance
had
first
startled
him
with
an
indefinable
impression
in
the
was
the
daughter
of
the
old
dissenting
preacher
who
had
shown
so
much
agitated
curiosity
about
his
name
he
felt
very
much
like
an
uninitiated
who
sees
that
the
pieces
are
in
a
peculiar
position
on
the
board
and
might
open
the
way
for
him
to
give
checkmate
if
he
only
knew
how
ever
since
his
interview
with
jermyn
his
mind
had
been
occupied
with
the
charade
it
offered
to
his
ingenuity
what
was
the
real
meaning
of
the
lawyer
interest
in
him
and
in
his
relations
with
maurice
christian
bycliffe
here
was
a
secret
and
secrets
were
often
a
source
of
profit
of
that
agreeable
kind
which
involved
little
labor
jermyn
had
hinted
at
profit
which
might
possibly
come
through
him
but
christian
said
inwardly
with
that
he
was
not
so
pitiable
a
nincompoop
as
to
trust
jermyn
on
the
contrary
the
only
problem
before
him
was
to
find
out
by
what
combination
of
independent
knowledge
he
could
outwit
jermyn
elude
any
purchase
the
attorney
had
on
him
through
his
past
history
and
get
a
handsome
bonus
by
which
a
somewhat
shattered
man
of
pleasure
might
live
well
without
a
master
christian
having
early
exhausted
the
more
impulsive
delights
of
life
had
become
a
sober
calculator
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
for
a
man
who
had
long
ago
run
through
his
own
money
servitude
in
a
great
family
was
the
best
kind
of
retirement
after
that
of
a
pensioner
but
if
a
better
chance
offered
a
person
of
talent
must
not
let
it
slip
through
his
fingers
he
held
various
ends
of
threads
but
there
was
danger
of
pulling
at
them
too
impatiently
he
had
not
forgotten
the
surprise
which
had
made
him
drop
the
when
crowder
talking
in
the
steward
room
had
said
that
a
scamp
named
henry
scaddon
had
been
concerned
in
a
lawsuit
about
the
transome
estate
again
jermyn
was
the
family
lawyer
of
the
transomes
he
knew
of
the
exchange
of
names
between
scaddon
and
bycliffe
he
clearly
wanted
to
know
as
much
as
he
could
about
history
the
conclusion
was
not
remote
that
bycliffe
had
had
some
claim
on
the
transome
property
and
that
a
difficulty
had
arisen
from
his
being
confounded
with
henry
scaddon
but
hitherto
the
other
incident
which
had
been
apparently
connected
with
the
interchange
of
names
lyon
demand
that
he
should
write
down
the
name
maurice
christian
accompanied
with
the
question
whether
that
were
his
whole
name
had
had
no
visible
link
with
the
inferences
arrived
at
through
crowder
and
jermyn
the
discovery
made
this
morning
at
the
free
school
that
esther
was
the
daughter
of
the
dissenting
preacher
at
last
suggested
a
possible
link
until
then
christian
had
not
known
why
esther
face
had
impressed
him
so
peculiarly
but
the
minister
chief
association
for
him
was
with
bycliffe
and
that
association
served
as
a
flash
to
show
him
that
esther
features
and
expression
and
still
more
her
bearing
now
she
stood
and
walked
revived
bycliffe
image
daughter
there
were
various
ways
of
being
a
daughter
suppose
this
were
a
case
of
adoption
suppose
bycliffe
were
known
to
be
dead
or
thought
to
be
dead
begad
if
the
old
parson
had
fancied
the
original
father
was
come
to
life
again
it
was
enough
to
frighten
him
a
little
slow
and
steady
christian
said
to
himself
i
get
some
talk
with
the
old
man
again
he
safe
enough
one
can
handle
him
without
cutting
one
self
i
tell
him
i
knew
bycliffe
and
was
his
i
worm
out
the
truth
about
this
daughter
could
pretty
annette
have
married
again
and
married
this
little
there
no
knowing
what
a
woman
will
not
do
christian
could
see
no
distinct
result
for
himself
from
his
industry
but
if
there
were
to
be
any
such
result
it
must
be
reached
by
following
out
every
clue
and
to
the
mind
there
are
dim
possibilities
in
law
and
heirship
which
prevent
any
issue
from
seeming
too
miraculous
the
consequence
of
these
meditations
was
that
christian
hung
about
treby
more
than
usual
in
his
leisure
time
and
that
on
the
first
opportunity
he
accosted
lyon
in
the
street
with
suitable
civility
stating
that
since
the
occasion
which
had
brought
them
together
some
weeks
before
he
had
often
wished
to
renew
their
conversation
and
with
lyon
permission
would
now
ask
to
do
so
after
being
assured
as
he
had
been
by
jermyn
that
this
courier
who
had
happened
by
some
accident
to
possess
the
memorable
locket
and
was
certainly
not
annette
husband
and
was
ignorant
whether
maurice
christian
bycliffe
were
living
or
dead
the
minister
mind
had
become
easy
again
his
habitual
lack
of
interest
in
personal
details
rendering
him
gradually
oblivious
of
jermyn
precautionary
statement
that
he
was
pursuing
enquiries
and
that
if
anything
of
interest
turned
up
lyon
should
be
made
acquainted
with
it
hence
when
christian
addressed
him
the
minister
taken
by
surprise
and
shaken
by
the
recollections
of
former
anxieties
said
helplessly
if
it
is
business
sir
you
would
perhaps
do
better
to
address
yourself
to
mr
jermyn
he
could
not
have
said
anything
that
was
a
more
valuable
hint
to
christian
he
inferred
that
the
minister
had
made
a
confidant
of
jermyn
and
it
was
needful
to
be
wary
on
the
contrary
sir
he
answered
it
may
be
of
the
utmost
importance
to
you
that
what
passes
between
us
should
not
be
known
to
mr
jermyn
lyon
was
perplexed
and
felt
at
once
that
he
was
no
more
in
clear
daylight
concerning
jermyn
than
concerning
christian
he
dared
not
neglect
the
possible
duty
of
hearing
what
this
man
had
to
say
and
he
invited
him
to
proceed
to
malthouse
yard
where
they
could
converse
in
private
once
in
lyon
study
christian
opened
the
dialogue
by
saying
that
since
he
was
in
this
room
before
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
the
anxiety
he
had
observed
in
lyon
might
be
owing
to
some
acquaintance
with
maurice
christian
bycliffe
a
in
france
whom
he
christian
had
assisted
in
getting
freed
from
his
imprisonment
and
who
in
fact
had
been
the
owner
of
the
trifles
which
lyon
had
recently
had
in
his
possession
and
had
restored
christian
hastened
to
say
that
he
knew
nothing
of
bycliffe
history
since
they
had
parted
in
france
but
that
he
knew
of
his
marriage
with
annette
ledru
and
had
been
acquainted
with
annette
herself
he
would
be
very
glad
to
know
what
became
of
bycliffe
if
he
could
for
he
liked
him
uncommonly
here
christian
paused
but
lyon
only
sat
changing
color
and
trembling
this
man
bearing
and
tone
of
mind
were
made
repulsive
to
him
by
being
brought
in
contact
with
memories
and
he
could
not
readily
summon
the
courage
to
give
answers
or
ask
questions
may
i
ask
if
you
knew
my
friend
bycliffe
said
christian
trying
a
more
direct
method
no
sir
i
never
saw
him
ah
well
you
have
seen
a
very
striking
likeness
of
him
wonderful
unaccountable
but
when
i
saw
miss
lyon
at
the
free
school
the
other
day
i
could
have
sworn
she
was
bycliffe
daughter
sir
said
lyon
in
his
deepest
tone
half
rising
and
holding
by
the
arms
of
his
chair
these
subjects
touch
me
with
too
sharp
a
point
for
you
to
be
justified
in
thrusting
them
on
me
out
of
mere
levity
is
there
any
good
you
seek
or
any
injury
you
fear
in
relation
to
them
precisely
sir
we
shall
come
to
an
understanding
suppose
i
believed
that
the
young
lady
who
goes
by
the
name
of
miss
lyon
was
the
daughter
of
bycliffe
lyon
moved
his
lips
silently
and
suppose
i
had
reason
to
suspect
that
there
would
be
some
great
advantage
for
her
if
the
law
knew
who
was
her
father
sir
said
lyon
shaken
out
of
all
reticence
i
would
not
conceal
it
she
believes
herself
to
be
my
daughter
but
i
will
bear
all
things
rather
than
deprive
her
of
a
right
nevertheless
i
appeal
to
the
pity
of
any
not
to
thrust
himself
between
her
and
me
but
to
let
me
disclose
the
truth
to
her
myself
all
in
good
time
said
christian
we
must
do
nothing
rash
then
miss
lyon
is
annette
child
the
minister
shivered
as
if
the
edge
of
a
knife
had
been
drawn
across
his
hand
but
the
tone
of
this
question
by
the
fact
that
it
intensified
his
antipathy
to
christian
enabled
him
to
collect
himself
for
what
must
be
simply
the
endurance
of
a
painful
operation
after
a
moment
or
two
he
said
more
coolly
it
is
true
sir
her
mother
became
my
wife
proceed
with
any
statement
which
may
concern
my
duty
i
have
no
more
to
say
than
this
if
there
a
prize
that
the
law
might
hand
over
to
bycliffe
daughter
i
am
much
mistaken
if
there
is
a
lawyer
who
take
precious
good
care
to
keep
the
law
hoodwinked
and
that
lawyer
is
mat
jermyn
why
my
good
sir
if
you
been
taking
jermyn
into
your
confidence
you
been
setting
the
fox
to
keep
off
the
weasel
it
strikes
me
that
when
you
were
made
a
little
anxious
about
those
articles
of
poor
bycliffe
you
put
jermyn
on
making
enquiries
of
me
eh
i
think
i
am
right
i
do
not
deny
it
ah
it
was
very
well
you
did
for
by
that
means
i
found
that
got
hold
of
some
secrets
about
bycliffe
which
he
means
to
stifle
now
sir
if
you
desire
any
justice
for
your
daughter
i
should
say
do
so
much
as
wink
to
yourself
before
jermyn

that
one
fact

concealing
from

the

to

of

perhaps
too

might

down

aloud
in

the
constraint

i
will
not

shakespeare
the
next
morning
after
much
prayer
for
the
needful
strength
and
wisdom
lyon
came
down
stairs
with
the
resolution
that
another
day
should
not
pass
without
the
fulfillment
of
the
task
he
had
laid
on
himself
but
what
hour
he
should
choose
for
this
solemn
disclosure
to
esther
must
depend
on
their
mutual
occupations
perhaps
he
must
defer
it
till
they
sat
up
alone
together
after
lyddy
was
gone
to
bed
but
at
breakfast
esther
said
is
a
holiday
father
my
pupils
are
all
going
to
duffield
to
see
the
wild
beasts
what
have
you
got
to
do
come
you
are
eating
no
breakfast
oh
lyddy
lyddy
the
eggs
are
hard
again
i
wish
you
would
not
read
alleyne
before
breakfast
it
makes
you
cry
and
forget
the
eggs
they
hard
and
that
the
truth
but
there
hearts
as
are
harder
miss
esther
said
lyddy
i
think
not
said
esther
this
is
leathery
enough
for
the
heart
of
the
most
obdurate
jew
pray
give
it
little
zachary
for
a
football
dear
dear
do
you
be
so
light
miss
we
may
all
be
dead
before
night
you
speak
out
of
season
my
good
lyddy
said
lyon
wearily
depart
into
the
kitchen
what
have
you
got
to
do
father
persisted
esther
i
have
a
holiday
lyon
felt
as
if
this
were
a
fresh
summons
not
to
delay
i
have
something
of
great
moment
to
do
my
dear
and
since
you
are
not
otherwise
demanded
i
will
ask
you
to
come
and
sit
with
me
esther
wondered
what
there
could
be
on
her
father
mind
more
pressing
than
his
morning
studies
soon
she
knew
motionless
but
mentally
stirred
as
she
had
never
been
before
esther
listened
to
her
mother
story
and
to
the
outpouring
of
her
experience
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
which
fell
athwart
the
books
the
sense
of
the
beginning
day
had
deepened
the
solemnity
more
than
night
would
have
done
all
knowledge
which
alters
our
lives
penetrates
us
more
when
it
comes
in
the
early
morning
the
day
that
has
to
be
travelled
with
something
new
and
perhaps
forever
sad
in
its
light
is
an
image
of
the
life
that
spreads
beyond
but
at
night
the
time
of
rest
is
near
lyon
regarded
his
narrative
as
a
confession
as
a
revelation
to
this
beloved
child
of
his
own
miserable
weakness
and
error
but
to
her
it
seemed
a
revelation
of
another
sort
her
mind
seemed
suddenly
enlarged
by
a
vision
of
passion
and
struggle
of
delight
and
renunciation
in
the
lot
of
beings
who
had
hitherto
been
a
dull
enigma
to
her
and
in
the
act
of
unfolding
to
her
that
he
was
not
her
real
father
but
had
only
striven
to
cherish
her
as
a
father
had
only
longed
to
be
loved
as
a
father
the
odd
unworldly
man
became
the
object
of
a
new
sympathy
in
which
esther
exulted
perhaps
this
knowledge
would
have
been
less
powerful
within
her
but
for
the
mental
preparation
that
had
come
during
the
last
two
months
from
her
acquaintance
with
felix
holt
which
had
taught
her
to
doubt
the
infallibility
of
her
own
standard
and
raised
a
presentiment
of
moral
depths
that
were
hidden
from
her
esther
had
taken
her
place
opposite
to
her
father
and
had
not
moved
even
her
clasped
hands
while
he
was
speaking
but
after
the
long
outpouring
in
which
he
seemed
to
lose
the
sense
of
everything
but
the
memories
he
was
giving
utterance
to
he
paused
a
little
while
and
then
said
timidly
this
is
a
late
retrieval
of
a
long
error
esther
i
make
not
excuses
for
myself
for
we
ought
to
strive
that
our
affections
be
rooted
in
the
truth
nevertheless
you
esther
had
risen
and
had
glided
on
to
the
wooden
stool
on
a
level
with
her
father
chair
where
he
was
accustomed
to
lay
books
she
wanted
to
speak
but
the
could
not
be
opened
for
words
alone
she
threw
her
arms
round
the
old
man
neck
and
sobbed
out
with
a
passionate
cry
father
father
forgive
me
if
i
have
not
loved
you
enough
i
will
i
will
the
old
man
little
delicate
frame
was
shaken
by
a
surprise
and
joy
that
was
almost
painful
in
their
intensity
he
had
been
going
to
ask
forgiveness
of
her
who
asked
it
for
herself
in
that
moment
of
supreme
complex
emotion
one
ray
of
the
minister
joy
was
the
thought
surely
the
work
of
grace
is
begun
in
her
surely
here
is
a
heart
that
the
lord
hath
touched
they
sat
so
enclasped
in
silence
while
esther
relieved
her
full
heart
when
she
raised
her
head
she
sat
quite
still
for
a
minute
or
two
looking
fixedly
before
her
and
keeping
one
little
hand
in
the
minister
presently
she
looked
at
him
and
said
then
you
lived
like
a
workingman
father
you
were
very
very
poor
yet
my
mother
had
been
used
to
luxury
she
was
well
born
she
was
a
lady
it
is
true
my
dear
it
was
a
poor
life
that
i
could
give
her
lyon
answered
in
utter
dimness
as
to
the
course
esther
mind
was
taking
he
had
anticipated
before
his
disclosure
from
his
discernment
of
tendencies
in
her
which
were
often
the
cause
of
silent
grief
to
him
that
the
discovery
likely
to
have
the
keenest
interest
for
her
would
be
that
her
parents
had
a
higher
rank
than
that
of
the
poor
dissenting
preacher
but
she
had
shown
that
other
and
better
sensibilities
were
predominant
he
rebuked
himself
now
for
a
hasty
and
shallow
judgment
concerning
the
child
inner
life
and
waited
for
new
clearness
but
that
must
be
the
best
life
father
said
esther
suddenly
rising
with
a
flush
across
her
paleness
and
standing
with
her
head
thrown
a
little
backward
as
if
some
illumination
had
given
her
a
new
decision
that
must
be
the
best
life
what
life
my
dear
child
why
that
where
one
bears
and
does
everything
because
of
some
great
and
strong
feeling
so
that
this
and
that
in
one
circumstances
signify
yea
verily
but
the
feeling
that
should
be
thus
supreme
is
devotedness
to
the
divine
will
esther
did
not
speak
her
father
words
did
not
fit
on
to
the
impressions
wrought
in
her
by
what
he
had
told
her
she
sat
down
again
and
said
more
quietly
mamma
did
not
speak
much
of
my
first
father
not
much
dear
she
said
he
was
beautiful
to
the
eye
and
good
and
generous
and
that
his
family
was
of
those
who
had
been
long
privileged
among
their
fellows
but
now
i
will
deliver
to
you
the
letters
which
together
with
the
ring
and
locket
are
the
only
visible
memorials
she
retained
of
him
lyon
reached
and
delivered
to
esther
the
box
containing
the
relics
take
them
and
examine
them
in
privacy
my
dear
and
that
i
may
no
more
err
by
concealment
i
will
tell
you
some
late
occurrences
that
bear
on
these
memorials
though
to
my
present
apprehension
doubtfully
and
confusedly
he
then
narrated
to
esther
all
that
had
passed
between
himself
and
christian
the
possibility
to
which
lyon
alarms
had
pointed
that
her
real
father
might
still
be
living
was
a
new
shock
she
could
not
speak
about
it
to
her
present
father
but
it
was
registered
in
silence
as
a
painful
addition
to
the
uncertainties
which
she
suddenly
saw
hanging
over
her
life
i
have
little
confidence
in
this
man
allegations
lyon
ended
i
confess
his
presence
and
speech
are
to
me
as
the
jarring
of
metal
he
bears
the
stamp
of
one
who
has
never
conceived
aught
of
more
sanctity
than
the
lust
of
the
eye
and
the
pride
of
life
he
hints
at
some
possible
inheritance
for
you
and
denounces
mysteriously
the
devices
of
jermyn
all
this
may
or
may
not
have
a
true
foundation
but
it
is
not
my
part
to
move
in
this
matter
save
on
a
clear
showing
certainly
not
father
said
esther
eagerly
a
little
while
ago
these
problematic
prospects
might
have
set
her
dreaming
pleasantly
but
now
for
some
reasons
that
she
could
not
have
put
distinctly
into
words
they
affected
her
with
dread
chapter

and

be
too
highly
heaped
for

to
in
the
afternoon
lyon
went
out
to
see
the
sick
amongst
his
flock
and
esther
who
had
been
passing
the
morning
in
dwelling
on
the
memories
and
the
few
remaining
relics
of
her
parents
was
left
alone
in
the
parlor
amidst
the
lingering
odors
of
the
early
dinner
not
easily
got
rid
of
in
that
small
house
rich
people
who
know
nothing
of
these
vulgar
details
can
hardly
imagine
their
significance
in
the
history
of
multitudes
of
human
lives
in
which
the
sensibilities
are
never
adjusted
to
the
external
conditions
esther
always
felt
so
much
discomfort
from
those
odors
that
she
usually
seized
any
possibility
of
escaping
from
them
and
they
oppressed
her
the
more
because
she
was
weary
with
agitation
why
did
she
not
put
on
her
bonnet
as
usual
and
get
out
into
the
open
air
it
was
one
of
those
pleasant
november
afternoons
pleasant
in
the
wide
country
when
the
sunshine
is
on
the
clinging
brown
leaves
of
the
young
oaks
and
the
last
yellow
leaves
of
the
elms
flutter
down
in
the
fresh
but
not
eager
breeze
but
esther
sat
still
on
the
sofa
pale
and
with
reddened
eyelids
her
curls
all
pushed
back
carelessly
and
her
elbow
resting
on
the
ridgy
black
horsehair
which
usually
almost
set
her
teeth
on
edge
if
she
pressed
it
even
through
her
sleeve
while
her
eyes
rested
blankly
on
the
dull
street
lyddy
had
said
miss
you
look
sadly
if
you
ca
take
a
walk
go
and
lie
down
she
had
never
seen
the
curls
in
such
disorder
and
she
reflected
that
there
had
been
a
death
from
typhus
recently
but
the
obstinate
miss
only
shook
her
head
esther
was
waiting
for
the
sake
of
not
a
probability
but
a
mere
possibility
which
made
the
brothy
odors
endurable
apparently
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
possibility
came
to
pass
for
she
changed
her
attitude
almost
started
from
her
seat
sat
down
again
and
listened
eagerly
if
lyddy
should
send
him
away
could
she
herself
rush
out
and
call
him
back
why
not
such
things
were
permissible
where
it
was
understood
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
that
there
was
only
friendship
but
lyddy
opened
the
door
and
said
here
holt
miss
wants
to
know
if
you
give
him
leave
to
come
in
i
told
him
you
was
sadly
oh
yes
lyddy
beg
him
to
come
in
i
should
not
have
persevered
said
felix
as
they
shook
hands
only
i
know
lyddy
dismal
way
but
you
do
look
ill
he
went
on
as
he
seated
himself
at
the
other
end
of
the
sofa
or
rather
for
that
a
false
way
of
putting
it
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
very
much
distressed
do
you
mind
about
my
taking
notice
of
it
he
spoke
very
kindly
and
looked
at
her
more
persistently
than
he
had
ever
done
before
when
her
hair
was
perfect
you
are
quite
right
i
am
not
at
all
ill
but
i
have
been
very
much
agitated
this
morning
my
father
has
been
telling
me
things
i
never
heard
before
about
my
mother
and
giving
me
things
that
belonged
to
her
she
died
when
i
was
a
very
little
creature
then
it
is
no
new
pain
or
trouble
for
you
and
lyon
i
could
not
help
being
anxious
to
know
that
esther
passed
her
hand
over
her
brow
before
she
answered
i
hardly
know
whether
it
is
pain
or
something
better
than
pleasure
it
has
made
me
see
things
i
was
blind
to
before
depths
in
my
father
nature
as
she
said
this
she
looked
at
felix
and
their
eyes
met
very
gravely
it
is
such
a
beautiful
day
he
said
it
would
do
you
good
to
go
into
the
air
let
me
take
you
along
the
river
toward
little
treby
will
you
i
will
put
my
bonnet
on
said
esther
unhesitatingly
though
they
had
never
walked
out
together
before
it
is
true
that
to
get
into
the
fields
they
had
to
pass
through
the
street
and
when
esther
saw
some
acquaintances
she
reflected
that
her
walking
alone
with
felix
might
be
a
subject
of
remark
all
the
more
because
of
his
cap
patched
boots
no
cravat
and
thick
stick
esther
was
a
little
amazed
herself
at
what
she
had
come
to
so
our
lives
glide
on
the
river
ends
we
do
know
where
and
the
sea
begins
and
there
is
no
more
jumping
ashore
when
they
were
in
the
streets
esther
hardly
spoke
felix
talked
with
his
usual
readiness
as
easily
as
if
he
were
not
doing
it
solely
to
divert
her
thoughts
first
about
job
tudge
delicate
chest
and
the
probability
that
the
little
monkey
would
not
live
long
and
then
about
a
miserable
beginning
of
a
which
was
all
he
could
get
together
at
sproxton
and
the
dismalness
of
that
hamlet
which
was
a
sort
of
lip
to
the
coalpit
on
one
side
and
the
public
on
the
other
and
yet
a
paradise
compared
with
the
wynds
of
glasgow
where
there
was
little
more
than
a
chink
of
daylight
to
show
the
hatred
in
women
faces
but
soon
they
got
into
the
fields
where
there
was
a
right
of
way
toward
little
treby
now
following
the
course
of
the
river
now
crossing
toward
a
lane
and
now
turning
into
a
through
a
plantation
here
we
are
said
felix
when
they
had
crossed
the
wooden
bridge
and
were
treading
on
the
slanting
shadows
made
by
the
i
think
this
is
delicious
i
never
feel
less
unhappy
than
in
these
late
autumn
afternoons
when
they
are
sunny
less
unhappy
there
now
said
esther
smiling
at
him
with
some
of
her
habitual
sauciness
i
have
caught
you
in
i
have
heard
you
quite
furious
against
puling
melancholy
people
if
i
had
said
what
you
have
just
said
you
would
have
given
me
a
long
lecture
and
told
me
to
go
home
and
interest
myself
in
the
reason
of
the
very
likely
said
felix
beating
the
weeds
according
to
the
foible
of
our
common
humanity
when
it
has
a
stick
in
its
hand
but
i
do
think
myself
a
fine
fellow
because
i
melancholy
i
do
measure
my
force
by
the
negations
in
me
and
think
my
soul
must
be
a
mighty
one
because
it
is
more
given
to
idle
suffering
than
to
beneficent
activity
that
what
your
favorite
gentlemen
do
of
the
style
i
do
admit
that
those
are
my
favorite
gentlemen
i
heard
you
defend
them
gentlemen
like
your
rénés
who
have
no
particular
talent
for
the
finite
but
a
general
sense
that
the
infinite
is
the
right
thing
for
them
they
might
as
well
boast
of
nausea
as
a
proof
of
a
strong
inside
stop
stop
you
run
on
in
that
way
to
get
out
of
my
reach
i
convicted
you
of
confessing
that
you
are
melancholy
yes
said
felix
thrusting
his
left
hand
into
his
pocket
with
a
shrug
as
i
could
confess
to
a
great
many
other
things
i
not
proud
of
the
fact
is
there
are
not
many
easy
lots
to
be
drawn
in
the
world
at
present
and
such
as
they
are
i
am
not
envious
of
them
i
do
say
life
is
not
worth
having
to
a
man
who
has
some
sparks
of
sense
and
feeling
and
bravery
in
him
and
the
finest
fellow
of
all
would
be
the
one
who
could
be
glad
to
have
lived
because
the
world
was
chiefly
miserable
and
his
life
had
come
to
help
some
one
who
needed
it
he
would
be
the
man
who
had
the
most
powers
and
the
fewest
selfish
wants
but
i
not
up
to
the
level
of
what
i
see
to
be
best
i
often
a
hungry
discontented
fellow
why
have
you
made
your
life
so
hard
then
said
esther
rather
frightened
as
she
asked
the
question
it
seems
to
me
you
have
tried
to
find
just
the
most
difficult
task
not
at
all
said
felix
with
curt
decision
my
course
was
a
very
simple
one
it
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
conditions
that
i
saw
as
clearly
as
i
see
the
bars
of
this
stile
it
a
difficult
stile
too
added
felix
striding
over
shall
i
help
you
or
will
you
be
left
to
yourself
i
can
do
without
help
thank
you
it
was
simple
enough
continued
felix
as
they
walked
on
if
i
meant
to
put
a
stop
to
the
sale
of
those
drugs
i
must
keep
my
mother
and
of
course
at
her
age
she
would
not
leave
the
place
she
had
been
used
to
and
i
had
made
up
my
mind
against
what
they
call
genteel
business
but
suppose
every
one
did
as
you
do
please
to
forgive
me
for
saying
so
but
i
can
not
see
why
you
could
not
have
lived
as
honorably
with
some
employment
that
presupposes
education
and
refinement
because
you
ca
see
my
history
or
my
nature
said
felix
bluntly
i
have
to
determine
for
myself
and
not
for
other
men
i
do
blame
them
or
think
i
am
better
than
they
their
circumstances
are
different
i
would
never
choose
to
withdraw
myself
from
the
labor
and
common
burden
of
the
world
but
i
do
choose
to
withdraw
myself
from
the
push
and
the
scramble
for
money
and
position
any
man
is
at
liberty
to
call
me
a
fool
and
say
that
mankind
are
benefited
by
the
push
and
the
scramble
in
the
but
i
care
for
the
people
who
live
now
and
will
not
be
living
when
the
comes
as
it
is
i
prefer
going
shares
with
the
unlucky
esther
did
not
speak
and
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
minute
or
two
till
they
passed
through
a
gate
into
a
plantation
where
there
was
no
large
timber
but
only
trees
and
underwood
so
that
the
sunlight
fell
on
the
mossy
spaces
which
lay
open
here
and
there
see
how
beautiful
those
stooping
are
with
the
light
on
them
said
felix
here
is
an
old
felled
trunk
they
have
not
thought
worth
carrying
away
shall
we
sit
down
a
little
while
yes
the
mossy
ground
with
the
dry
leaves
sprinkled
over
it
is
delightful
to
one
feet
esther
sat
down
and
took
off
her
bonnet
that
the
light
breeze
might
fall
on
her
head
felix
too
threw
down
his
cap
and
stick
lying
on
the
ground
with
his
back
against
the
felled
trunk
i
wish
i
felt
more
as
you
do
she
said
looking
at
the
point
of
her
foot
which
was
playing
with
a
tuft
of
moss
i
ca
help
caring
very
much
what
happens
to
me
and
you
seem
to
care
so
little
about
yourself
you
are
thoroughly
mistaken
said
felix
it
is
just
because
i
a
very
ambitious
fellow
with
very
hungry
passions
wanting
a
great
deal
to
satisfy
me
that
i
have
chosen
to
give
up
what
people
call
worldly
good
at
least
that
has
been
one
determining
reason
it
all
depends
on
what
a
man
gets
into
his
consciousness
what
life
thrusts
into
his
mind
so
that
it
becomes
present
to
him
as
remorse
is
present
to
the
guilty
or
a
mechanical
problem
to
an
inventive
genius
there
are
two
things
i
got
present
in
that
way
one
of
them
is
the
picture
of
what
i
should
hate
to
be
i
determined
never
to
go
about
making
my
face
simpering
or
solemn
and
telling
professional
lies
for
profit
or
to
get
tangled
in
affairs
where
i
must
wink
at
dishonesty
and
pocket
the
proceeds
and
justify
that
knavery
as
part
of
a
system
that
i
alter
if
i
once
went
into
that
sort
of
struggle
for
success
i
should
want
to
win
i
should
defend
the
wrong
that
i
had
once
identified
myself
with
i
should
become
everything
that
i
see
now
beforehand
to
be
detestable
and
what
more
i
should
do
this
as
men
are
doing
it
every
day
for
a
ridiculously
small
prize
perhaps
for
none
at
all
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
two
parlors
a
rank
eligible
for
the
churchwardenship
a
discontented
wife
and
several
unhopeful
children
esther
felt
a
terrible
pressure
on
her
heart
the
certainty
of
her
remoteness
from
felix
the
sense
that
she
was
utterly
trivial
to
him
the
other
thing
that
got
into
my
mind
like
a
splinter
said
felix
after
a
pause
is
the
life
of
the
miserable
the
spawning
life
of
vice
and
hunger
i
never
be
one
of
the
sleek
dogs
the
old
catholics
are
right
with
their
higher
rule
and
their
lower
some
are
called
to
subject
themselves
to
a
harder
discipline
and
renounce
things
voluntarily
which
are
lawful
for
others
it
is
the
old
word
is
laid
upon
me
it
seems
to
me
you
are
stricter
than
my
father
is
no
i
quarrel
with
no
delight
that
is
not
base
or
cruel
but
one
must
sometimes
accommodate
one
self
to
a
small
share
that
is
the
lot
of
the
majority
i
would
wish
the
minority
joy
only
they
do
want
my
wishes
again
there
was
silence
esther
cheeks
were
hot
in
spite
of
the
breeze
that
sent
her
hair
floating
backward
she
felt
an
inward
strain
a
demand
on
her
to
see
things
in
a
light
that
was
not
easy
or
soothing
when
felix
had
asked
her
to
walk
he
seemed
so
kind
so
alive
to
what
might
be
her
feelings
that
she
had
thought
herself
nearer
to
him
than
she
had
ever
been
before
but
since
they
had
come
out
he
had
appeared
to
forget
all
that
and
yet
she
was
conscious
that
this
impatience
of
hers
was
very
petty
battling
in
this
way
with
her
own
little
impulses
and
looking
at
the
opposite
till
her
gaze
was
too
wide
for
her
to
see
anything
distinctly
she
was
unaware
how
long
they
had
remained
without
speaking
she
did
not
know
that
felix
had
changed
his
attitude
a
little
and
was
resting
his
elbow
on
the
while
he
supported
his
head
which
was
turned
toward
her
suddenly
he
said
in
a
lower
tone
than
was
habitual
to
him
you
are
very
beautiful
she
started
and
looked
round
at
him
to
see
whether
his
face
would
give
some
help
to
the
interpretation
of
this
novel
speech
he
was
looking
up
at
her
quite
calmly
very
much
as
a
reverential
protestant
might
look
at
a
picture
of
the
virgin
with
a
devoutness
suggested
by
the
type
rather
than
by
the
image
esther
vanity
was
not
in
the
least
gratified
she
felt
that
somehow
or
other
felix
was
going
to
reproach
her
i
wonder
he
went
on
still
looking
at
her
whether
the
subtle
measuring
of
forces
will
ever
come
to
measuring
the
force
there
would
be
in
one
beautiful
woman
whose
mind
was
as
noble
as
her
face
was
beautiful
who
made
a
man
passion
for
her
rush
in
one
current
with
all
the
great
aims
of
his
life
esther
eyes
got
hot
and
smarting
it
was
no
use
trying
to
be
dignified
she
had
turned
away
her
head
and
now
said
rather
bitterly
it
is
difficult
for
a
woman
ever
to
try
to
be
anything
good
when
she
is
not
believed
in
when
it
is
always
supposed
that
she
must
be
contemptible
no
dear
esther
it
was
the
first
time
felix
had
been
prompted
to
call
her
by
her
christian
name
and
as
he
did
so
he
laid
his
large
hand
on
her
two
little
hands
which
were
clasped
on
her
knees
you
believe
that
i
think
you
contemptible
when
i
first
saw
you
i
know
i
know
said
esther
interrupting
him
impetuously
but
still
looking
away
you
mean
you
did
think
me
contemptible
then
but
it
was
very
narrow
of
you
to
judge
me
in
that
way
when
my
life
had
been
so
different
from
yours
i
have
great
faults
i
know
i
am
selfish
and
think
too
much
of
my
own
small
tastes
and
too
little
of
what
affects
others
but
i
am
not
stupid
i
am
not
unfeeling
i
can
see
what
is
better
but
i
have
not
done
you
injustice
since
i
knew
more
of
you
said
felix
gently
yes
you
have
said
esther
turning
and
smiling
at
him
through
her
tears
you
talk
to
me
like
an
angry
pedagogue
were
always
wise
remember
the
time
when
you
were
foolish
or
naughty
that
is
not
far
off
said
felix
curtly
taking
away
his
hand
and
clasping
it
with
the
other
at
the
back
of
his
head
the
talk
which
seemed
to
be
introducing
a
mutual
understanding
such
as
had
not
existed
before
seemed
to
have
undergone
some
check
shall
we
get
up
and
walk
back
now
said
esther
after
a
few
moments
no
said
felix
entreatingly
do
move
yet
i
dare
say
we
shall
never
walk
together
or
sit
here
again
why
not
because
i
am
a
man
who
am
warned
by
visions
those
old
stories
of
visions
and
dreams
guiding
men
have
their
truth
we
are
saved
by
making
the
future
present
to
ourselves
i
wish
i
could
get
visions
then
said
esther
smiling
at
him
with
an
effort
of
playfulness
in
resistance
to
something
vaguely
mournful
within
her
that
is
what
i
want
said
felix
looking
at
her
very
earnestly
turn
your
head
do
look
at
me
and
then
i
shall
know
if
i
may
go
on
speaking
i
do
believe
in
you
but
i
want
you
to
have
such
a
vision
of
the
future
that
you
may
never
lose
your
best
self
some
charm
or
other
may
be
flung
about
you
some
of
your
fascinations
and
nothing
but
a
good
strong
terrible
vision
will
save
you
and
if
it
did
save
you
you
might
be
that
woman
i
was
thinking
of
a
little
while
ago
when
i
looked
at
your
face
the
woman
whose
beauty
makes
a
great
task
easier
to
men
instead
of
turning
them
away
from
it
i
am
not
likely
to
see
such
fine
issues
but
they
may
come
where
a
woman
spirit
is
finely
touched
i
should
like
to
be
sure
they
would
come
to
you
why
are
you
not
likely
to
know
what
becomes
of
me
said
esther
turning
away
her
eyes
in
spite
of
his
command
why
should
you
not
always
be
my
father
friend
and
mine
oh
i
shall
go
away
as
soon
as
i
can
to
some
large
town
said
felix
in
his
more
usual
tone
some
ugly
wicked
miserable
place
i
want
to
be
a
demagogue
of
a
new
sort
an
honest
one
if
possible
who
will
tell
the
people
they
are
blind
and
foolish
and
neither
flatter
them
nor
fatten
on
them
i
have
my
heritage
an
order
i
belong
to
i
have
the
blood
of
a
line
of
handicraftsmen
in
my
veins
and
i
want
to
stand
up
for
the
lot
of
the
handicraftsman
as
a
good
lot
in
which
a
man
may
be
better
trained
to
all
the
best
functions
of
his
nature
than
if
he
belonged
to
the
grimacing
set
who
have
and
are
proud
to
be
thought
richer
than
their
neighbors
would
nothing
ever
make
it
seem
right
to
you
to
change
your
mind
said
esther
she
had
rapidly
woven
some
possibilities
out
of
the
new
uncertainties
in
her
own
lot
though
she
would
not
for
the
world
have
had
felix
know
of
her
weaving
suppose
by
some
means
or
other
a
fortune
might
come
to
you
honorably
by
marriage
or
in
any
other
unexpected
way
would
you
see
no
change
in
your
course
no
said
felix
peremptorily
i
will
never
be
rich
i
do
count
that
as
any
peculiar
virtue
some
men
do
well
to
accept
riches
but
that
is
not
my
inward
vocation
i
have
no
with
the
rich
as
a
class
the
habits
of
their
lives
are
odious
to
me
thousands
of
men
have
wedded
poverty
because
they
expect
to
go
to
heaven
for
it
i
expect
to
go
to
heaven
for
it
but
i
wed
it
because
it
enables
me
to
do
what
i
most
want
to
do
on
earth
whatever
the
hopes
for
the
world
may
be
whether
great
or
small
i
am
a
man
of
this
generation
i
will
try
to
make
life
less
bitter
for
a
few
within
my
reach
it
is
held
reasonable
enough
to
toil
for
the
fortunes
of
a
family
though
it
may
turn
to
imbecility
in
the
third
generation
i
choose
a
family
with
more
chances
in
it
esther
looked
before
her
dreamily
till
she
said
that
seems
a
hard
lot
yet
it
is
a
great
one
she
rose
to
walk
back
then
you
do
think
i
a
fool
said
felix
loudly
starting
to
his
feet
and
then
stooping
to
gather
up
his
cap
and
stick
of
course
you
suspected
me
of
that
stupidity
well
women
unless
they
are
saint
theresas
or
elizabeth
frys
generally
think
this
sort
of
thing
madness
unless
when
they
read
of
it
in
the
bible
a
woman
can
hardly
ever
choose
in
that
way
she
is
dependent
on
what
happens
to
her
she
must
take
meaner
things
because
only
meaner
things
are
within
her
reach
why
can
you
imagine
yourself
choosing
hardship
as
the
better
lot
said
felix
looking
at
her
with
a
sudden
question
in
his
eyes
yes
i
can
she
said
flushing
over
neck
and
brow
their
words
were
charged
with
a
meaning
dependent
entirely
on
the
secret
consciousness
of
each
nothing
had
been
said
which
was
necessarily
personal
they
walked
a
few
yards
along
the
road
by
which
they
had
come
without
further
speech
till
felix
said
gently
take
my
arm
she
took
it
and
they
walked
home
so
entirely
without
conversation
felix
was
struggling
as
a
firm
man
struggles
with
a
temptation
seeing
beyond
it
and
disbelieving
its
lying
promise
esther
was
struggling
as
a
woman
struggles
with
the
yearning
for
some
expression
of
love
and
with
vexation
under
that
subjection
to
a
yearning
which
is
not
likely
to
be
satisfied
each
was
conscious
of
a
silence
which
each
was
unable
to
break
till
they
entered
malthouse
lane
and
were
within
a
few
yards
of
the
minister
door
it
is
getting
dusk
felix
then
said
will
lyon
be
anxious
about
you
no
i
think
not
lyddy
would
tell
him
that
i
went
out
with
you
and
that
you
carried
a
large
stick
said
esther
with
a
light
laugh
felix
went
in
with
esther
to
take
tea
but
the
conversation
was
entirely
between
him
and
lyon
about
the
tricks
of
canvassing
the
foolish
personality
of
the
placards
and
the
probabilities
of
transome
return
as
to
which
felix
declared
himself
to
have
become
indifferent
this
scepticism
made
the
minister
uneasy
he
had
great
belief
in
the
old
political
watchwords
had
preached
that
universal
suffrage
and
no
ballot
were
agreeable
to
the
will
of
god
and
liked
to
believe
that
a
visible
instrument
was
forthcoming
in
the
radical
candidate
who
had
pronounced
emphatically
against
whig
finality
felix
being
in
a
perverse
mood
contended
that
universal
suffrage
would
be
equally
agreeable
to
the
devil
that
he
would
change
his
politics
a
little
have
a
larger
traffic
and
see
himself
more
fully
represented
in
parliament
nay
my
friend
said
the
minister
you
are
again
sporting
with
paradox
for
you
will
not
deny
that
you
glory
in
the
name
of
radical
or
man
as
they
said
in
the
great
times
when
nonconformity
was
in
its
giant
youth
a
radical
yes
but
i
want
to
go
to
some
roots
a
good
deal
lower
down
than
the
franchise
truly
there
is
a
work
within
which
can
not
be
dispensed
with
but
it
is
our
preliminary
work
to
free
men
from
the
stifled
life
of
political
nullity
and
bring
them
into
what
milton
calls
liberal
air
wherein
alone
can
be
wrought
the
final
triumphs
of
the
spirit
with
all
my
heart
but
while
caliban
is
caliban
though
you
multiply
him
by
a
million
he
worship
every
trinculo
that
carries
a
bottle
i
forget
though
you
do
read
shakespeare
mr
lyon
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
i
have
so
far
looked
into
a
volume
of
esther
as
to
conceive
your
meaning
but
the
fantasies
therein
were
so
little
to
be
reconciled
with
a
steady
contemplation
of
that
divine
economy
which
is
hidden
from
sense
and
revealed
to
faith
that
i
forbore
the
reading
as
likely
to
perturb
my
ministrations
esther
sat
by
in
unusual
silence
the
conviction
that
felix
willed
her
exclusion
from
his
life
was
making
it
plain
that
something
more
than
friendship
between
them
was
not
so
thoroughly
out
of
the
question
as
she
had
always
inwardly
asserted
in
her
pain
that
his
choice
lay
aloof
from
her
she
was
compelled
frankly
to
admit
to
herself
the
longing
that
it
had
been
otherwise
and
that
he
had
entreated
her
to
share
his
difficult
life
he
was
like
no
one
else
to
her
he
had
seemed
to
bring
at
once
a
law
and
the
love
that
gave
strength
to
obey
the
law
yet
the
next
moment
stung
by
his
independence
of
her
she
denied
that
she
loved
him
she
had
only
longed
for
a
moral
support
under
the
negations
of
her
life
if
she
were
not
to
have
that
support
all
effort
seemed
useless
esther
had
been
so
long
used
to
hear
the
formulas
of
her
father
belief
without
feeling
or
understanding
them
that
they
had
lost
all
power
to
touch
her
the
first
religious
experience
of
her
life
the
first
the
first
voluntary
subjection
the
first
longing
to
acquire
the
strength
of
greater
motives
and
obey
the
more
strenuous
rule
had
come
to
her
through
felix
holt
no
wonder
that
she
felt
as
if
the
loss
of
him
were
inevitable
backsliding
but
was
it
certain
that
she
should
lose
him
she
did
not
believe
that
he
was
really
indifferent
to
her
chapter
xxviii
but
what
says
jupiter
i
ask
thee
alas
sir
i
know
not
jupiter
i
never
drank
with
him
in
all
my
life
the
multiplication
of
uncomplimentary
placards
noticed
by
lyon
and
felix
holt
was
one
of
several
signs
that
the
days
of
nomination
and
election
were
approaching
the
presence
of
the
revising
barrister
in
treby
was
not
only
an
opportunity
for
all
persons
not
otherwise
busy
to
show
their
zeal
for
the
purification
of
the
but
also
to
reconcile
private
ease
and
public
duty
by
standing
about
the
streets
and
lounging
at
doors
it
was
no
light
business
for
trebians
to
form
an
opinion
the
mere
fact
of
a
public
functionary
with
an
unfamiliar
title
was
enough
to
give
them
pause
as
a
premise
that
was
not
to
be
quickly
started
from
to
mr
pink
the
saddler
for
example
until
some
distinct
injury
or
benefit
had
accrued
to
him
the
existence
of
the
revising
barrister
was
like
the
existence
of
the
young
giraffe
which
wombwell
had
lately
brought
into
those
parts
it
was
to
be
contemplated
and
not
criticised
mr
pink
professed
a
toryism
but
he
regarded
all
as
radical
and
somewhat
impious
as
disturbing
to
trade
and
likely
to
offend
the
gentry
or
the
servants
through
whom
their
harness
was
ordered
there
was
a
nemesis
in
things
which
made
objection
unsafe
and
even
the
reform
bill
was
a
sort
of
electric
eel
which
a
thriving
tradesman
had
better
leave
alone
it
was
only
the
papists
who
lived
far
enough
off
to
be
spoken
of
uncivilly
but
mr
pink
was
fond
of
news
which
he
collected
and
retailed
with
perfect
impartiality
noting
facts
and
rejecting
comments
hence
he
was
well
pleased
to
have
his
shop
so
constant
a
place
of
resort
for
loungers
that
to
many
trebians
there
was
a
strong
association
between
the
pleasures
of
gossip
and
the
smell
of
leather
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
chalking
and
cutting
and
of
keeping
his
journeymen
close
at
work
at
the
very
time
that
he
learned
from
his
visitors
who
were
those
whose
votes
had
been
called
in
question
before
his
honor
how
lawyer
jermyn
had
been
too
much
for
lawyer
labron
about
todd
cottages
and
how
in
the
opinion
of
some
townsmen
this
looking
into
the
value
of
people
property
and
swearing
it
down
below
a
certain
sum
was
a
nasty
inquisitorial
kind
of
thing
while
others
observed
that
being
nice
to
a
few
pounds
was
all
nonsense
they
should
put
the
figure
high
enough
and
then
never
mind
if
a
voter
qualification
was
thereabouts
but
said
sims
the
auctioneer
everything
was
done
for
the
sake
of
the
lawyers
mr
pink
suggested
impartially
that
lawyers
must
live
but
sims
having
a
ready
auctioneering
wit
did
not
see
that
so
many
of
them
need
live
or
that
babies
were
born
lawyers
mr
pink
felt
that
this
speculation
was
complicated
by
the
ordering
of
for
daughters
and
returning
to
the
firm
ground
of
fact
stated
that
it
was
getting
dusk
the
dusk
seemed
deepened
the
next
moment
by
a
tall
figure
obstructing
the
doorway
at
sight
of
whom
mr
pink
rubbed
his
hands
and
smiled
and
bowed
more
than
once
with
evident
solicitude
to
show
honor
where
honor
was
due
while
he
said
christian
sir
how
do
you
do
sir
christian
answered
with
the
condescending
familiarity
of
a
superior
very
badly
i
can
tell
you
with
these
confounded
braces
that
you
were
to
make
such
a
fine
job
of
see
old
fellow
they
burst
out
again
very
sorry
sir
can
you
leave
them
with
me
oh
yes
i
leave
them
what
the
news
eh
said
christian
half
seating
himself
on
a
high
stool
and
beating
his
boot
with
a
well
sir
we
look
to
you
to
tell
us
that
said
mr
pink
with
a
knowing
smile
you
at
headquarters
eh
sir
that
was
what
i
said
to
scales
the
other
day
he
came
up
for
some
straps
scales
did
and
he
asked
that
question
in
pretty
near
the
same
terms
that
done
sir
and
i
answered
him
as
i
may
say
ditto
not
meaning
any
disrespect
to
you
sir
but
a
way
of
speaking
come
that
gammon
pink
said
christian
you
know
everything
you
can
tell
me
if
you
will
who
is
the
fellow
employed
to
paste
up
transome
handbills
what
do
say
mr
sims
said
pink
looking
at
the
auctioneer
why
you
know
and
i
know
well
enough
it
tommy
trounsem
an
old
crippling
fellow
most
people
know
tommy
i
employed
him
myself
for
charity
where
shall
i
find
him
said
christian
at
the
in
pollard
end
most
likely
said
sims
i
do
know
where
he
puts
himself
when
he
is
at
the
public
he
was
a
stoutish
fellow
fifteen
year
ago
when
he
carried
pots
said
mr
pink
ay
and
has
snared
many
a
hare
in
his
time
said
sims
but
he
was
always
a
little
cracked
lord
bless
you
he
used
to
swear
he
had
a
right
to
the
transome
estate
why
what
put
that
notion
into
his
head
said
christian
who
had
learned
more
than
he
expected
the
lawing
sir
nothing
but
the
lawing
about
the
estate
there
was
a
deal
of
it
twenty
year
ago
said
mr
pink
tommy
happened
to
turn
up
hereabout
at
that
time
a
big
lungeous
fellow
who
would
speak
disrespectfully
of
hanybody
oh
he
meant
no
harm
said
sims
he
was
fond
of
a
drop
to
drink
and
not
quite
right
in
the
upper
story
and
he
could
hear
no
difference
between
trounsem
and
transome
it
an
odd
way
of
speaking
they
have
in
that
part
where
he
was
born
a
little
you
hear
it
in
his
tongue
now
if
you
talk
to
him
at
the
i
shall
find
him
eh
said
christian
getting
off
his
stool
pink
christian
went
straight
from
the
saddler
to
quorlen
the
tory
printer
with
whom
he
had
contrived
a
political
spree
quorlen
was
a
new
man
in
treby
who
had
so
reduced
the
trade
of
dow
the
old
hereditary
printer
that
dow
had
lapsed
to
whiggery
and
radicalism
and
opinions
in
general
so
far
as
they
were
contented
to
express
themselves
in
a
small
stock
of
types
quorlen
had
brought
his
duffield
wit
with
him
and
insisted
that
religion
and
joking
were
the
handmaids
of
politics
on
which
principle
he
and
christian
undertook
the
joking
and
left
the
religion
to
the
rector
the
joke
at
present
in
question
was
a
practical
one
christian
turning
into
the
shop
merely
said
found
him
out
give
me
the
placards
and
tucking
a
thickish
flat
bundle
wrapped
in
a
black
glazed
cotton
bag
under
his
arm
walked
out
into
the
dusk
again
suppose
now
he
said
to
himself
as
he
strode
along
suppose
there
should
be
some
secret
to
be
got
out
of
this
old
scamp
or
some
notion
that
as
good
as
a
secret
to
those
who
know
how
to
use
it
that
would
be
virtue
rewarded
but
i
afraid
the
old
tosspot
is
not
likely
to
be
good
for
much
there
truth
in
wine
and
there
may
be
some
in
gin
and
muddy
beer
but
whether
it
truth
worth
my
knowing
is
another
question
i
got
plenty
of
truth
but
never
any
that
was
worth
a
sixpence
to
me
the
was
a
very
public
its
bar
was
a
big
rambling
kitchen
with
an
undulating
brick
floor
the
windows
threw
an
interesting
obscurity
over
the
dresser
garnished
with
pewter
and
tin
and
with
large
dishes
that
seemed
to
speak
of
better
times
the
two
settles
were
half
pushed
under
the
chimney
and
the
grate
with
its
brick
hobs
massive
iron
crane
and
various
pothooks
suggested
a
generous
plenty
possibly
existent
in
all
moods
and
tenses
except
the
indicative
present
one
way
of
getting
an
idea
of
our
miseries
is
to
go
and
look
at
their
pleasures
the
had
a
landlord
and
a
yellow
sickly
landlady
with
a
large
white
kerchief
bound
round
her
cap
as
if
her
head
had
recently
required
surgery
it
had
doctored
ale
an
odor
of
bad
tobacco
and
remarkably
strong
cheese
it
was
not
what
astræa
when
come
back
might
be
expected
to
approve
as
the
scene
of
ecstatic
enjoyment
for
the
beings
whose
special
prerogative
it
is
to
lift
their
sublime
faces
toward
heaven
still
there
was
ample
space
on
the
hearth
accommodation
for
narrative
bagmen
or
boxmen
room
for
a
man
to
stretch
his
legs
his
brain
was
not
pressed
upon
by
a
white
wall
within
a
yard
of
him
and
the
light
did
not
stare
in
mercilessly
on
bare
ugliness
turning
the
fire
to
ashes
compared
with
some
beerhouses
of
this
more
advanced
period
the
of
that
day
presented
a
high
standard
of
pleasure
but
though
this
venerable
public
had
not
failed
to
share
in
the
recent
political
excitement
of
drinking
the
pleasures
it
offered
were
not
at
this
hour
of
the
evening
sought
by
a
numerous
company
there
were
only
three
or
four
pipes
being
smoked
by
the
firelight
but
it
was
enough
for
christian
when
he
found
that
one
of
these
was
being
smoked
by
the
whose
large
flat
basket
stuffed
with
placards
leaned
near
him
against
the
settle
so
splendid
an
apparition
as
christian
was
not
a
little
startling
at
the
and
was
gazed
at
in
expectant
silence
but
he
was
a
stranger
in
pollard
end
and
was
taken
for
the
highest
style
of
traveller
when
he
declared
that
he
was
deucedly
thirsty
ordered
sixpenny
worth
of
gin
and
a
large
jug
of
water
and
putting
a
few
drops
of
the
spirit
into
his
own
glass
invited
tommy
trounsem
who
sat
next
him
to
help
himself
tommy
was
not
slower
than
a
shaking
hand
obliged
him
to
be
in
accepting
this
invitation
he
was
a
tall
old
fellow
who
had
once
been
but
his
cheeks
and
chest
were
both
hollow
now
and
his
limbs
were
shrunken
you
got
some
bills
there
master
eh
said
christian
pointing
to
the
basket
is
there
an
auction
coming
on
auction
no
said
tommy
with
a
gruff
hoarseness
which
was
the
remnant
of
a
jovial
bass
and
with
an
accent
which
differed
from
the
trebian
fitfully
as
an
early
habit
is
wont
to
reassert
itself
nought
to
do
wi
auctions
i
a
charicter
it
me
am
getting
trounsem
into
trounsem
said
he
the
landlord
observed
taking
out
his
pipe
with
a
low
laugh
it
transome
sir
maybe
you
do
belong
to
this
part
it
the
candidate
do
most
for
the
workingmen
and
proved
it
too
in
the
way
o
being
and
wishing
to
enjoy
themselves
if
i
twenty
votes
i
give
one
for
transome
and
i
do
care
who
hears
me
the
landlord
peered
out
from
his
fungous
cluster
of
features
with
a
beery
confidence
that
the
high
figure
of
twenty
had
somehow
raised
the
hypothetic
value
of
his
vote
spilkins
now
said
tommy
waving
his
hand
to
the
landlord
you
let
one
gentelman
speak
to
another
will
you
this
genelman
wants
to
know
about
my
bills
does
he
or
does
he
what
then
i
spoke
according
said
the
landlord
mildly
holding
his
own
you
all
very
well
spilkins
returned
tommy
but
me
i
know
what
the
bills
are
it
public
business
i
none
o
your
common
master
i
left
off
sticking

guineas

low
stuff
like

bills
and

rightful
family
and
so
i
give

a
lift

and
if
old
nick

to
lay
hold
on
me

poaching

say

hanged
for
a
lawyer
old
nick
every

and
billsons
but
i
a
trounsem
i
am
what
do
you
say
to
that
master
this
appeal
accompanied
by
a
blow
on
the
table
while
the
landlord
winked
at
the
company
was
addressed
to
christian
who
answered
with
severe
gravity
i
say
there
is
any
work
more
honorable
than
no
no
said
tommy
wagging
his
head
from
side
to
side
i
thought
you
come
in
to
that
i
thought
you
know
better
than
say
contrairy
but
i
shake
hands
wi
you
i
do
want
to
knock
any
man
head
off
i
a
good
chap
a
sound
crock
an
old
family
kep
out
o
my
rights
i
shall
go
to
heaven
for
all
old
nick
as
these
celestial
prospects
might
imply
that
a
little
extra
gin
was
beginning
to
tell
on
the
christian
wanted
to
lose
no
time
in
arresting
his
attention
he
laid
his
hand
on
tommy
and
spoke
emphatically
but
i
tell
you
what
you
are
not
up
to
you
should
be
on
the
when
debarry
side
have
stuck
up
fresh
bills
and
go
and
paste
yours
over
them
i
know
where
there
a
lot
of
debarry
bills
now
come
along
with
me
and
i
show
you
we
paste
them
over
and
then
we
come
back
and
treat
the
company
hooray
said
tommy
let
be
off
then
he
was
one
of
the
thoroughly
inured
originally
hale
drunkards
and
did
not
easily
lose
his
head
or
legs
or
the
ordinary
amount
of
method
in
his
talk
strangers
often
supposed
that
tommy
was
tipsy
when
he
had
only
taken
what
he
called
one
blessed
pint
chiefly
from
that
glorious
contentment
with
himself
and
his
adverse
fortunes
which
is
not
usually
characteristic
of
the
sober
briton
he
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
seized
his
and
his
basket
and
prepared
to
start
with
a
satisfactory
promise
that
he
could
know
what
he
was
about
the
landlord
and
some
others
had
confidently
concluded
that
they
understood
all
about
christian
now
he
was
a
transome
man
come
to
see
after
the
in
transome
interest
the
landlord
telling
his
yellow
wife
snappishly
to
open
the
door
for
the
gentleman
hoped
soon
to
see
him
again
this
is
a
transome
house
sir
he
observed
in
respect
of
entertaining
customers
of
that
color
i
do
my
duty
as
a
publican
which
if
i
know
it
is
to
turn
back
no
genelman
money
i
say
give
every
genelman
a
chance
and
the
more
the
merrier
in
and
out
of
it
and
if
anybody
says
they
want
but
two
men
i
say
it
be
better
for
trade
if
there
was
six
of
and
voters
according
ay
ay
said
christian
you
a
sensible
man
landlord
you
mean
to
vote
for
debarry
then
eh
not
nohow
said
the
landlord
thinking
that
where
negatives
were
good
the
more
you
had
of
them
the
better
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
christian
and
his
new
companion
tommy
said
now
master
if
you
to
be
my
lantern
do
you
be
a
jacky
lantern
which
i
take
to
mean
one
as
leads
you
the
wrong
way
for
i
tell
you
what
if
you
had
the
luck
to
fall
in
wi
tommy
trounsem
do
you
let
him
drop
no
no
to
be
sure
not
said
christian

here

to
the
back
brewery

a
man

lived
up
there
at
trounsem
park
and
snared
his
own
game
which
i

tommy
wagging
his
head
at
christian

the
dimness
undisturbed
by
gas

o
your
shooting

me
it
two
to

if

fishes
to
come
that
nothing
again
the
sporting
genelman
and
that
what
i
say
by
snaring
but
if
you
a
right
to
the
transome
estate
how
was
it
you
were
kept
out
of
it
old
boy
it
was
some
foul
shame
or
other
eh
it
the
law
that
what
it
is
you
a
good
sort
of
chap
i
mind
telling
you
there
folks
born
to
property
and
there
folks
catch
hold
on
it
and
the
law
made
for
them
to
catch
hold
i
pretty
deep
i
see
a
good
deal
further
than
spilkins
there
was
ned
patch
the
peddler
used
to
say
to
me
canna
read
tommy
says
he
thank
you
says
i
not
going
to
crack
my
headpiece
to
make
myself
as
big
a
fool
as
you
i
was
fond
o
ned
many
the
pot
we
had
together
i
see
well
enough
you
deep
tommy
how
came
you
to
know
you
were
born
to
property
it
was
the
regester
the
parish
regester
said
tommy
with
his
knowing
wag
of
the
head
that
shows
as
you
was
born
i
allays
felt
it
inside
me
as
i
was
somebody
and
i
could
see
other
chaps
thought
it
on
me
too
and
so
one
day
at
littleshaw
where
i
kep
ferrets
and
a
little
bit
of
a
public
there
come
a
fine
man
looking
after
me
and
walking
me
up
and
down
wi
questions
and
i
made
out
from
the
clerk
as
he
been
at
the
regester
and
i
gave
the
clerk
a
pot
or
two
and
he
got
it
off
our
parson
as
the
name
o
trounsem
was
a
great
name
hereabout
and
i
waits
a
bit
for
my
fine
man
to
come
again
thinks
i
if
there
property
wants
a
right
owner
i
shall
be
called
for
for
i
did
know
the
law
then
and
i
waited
and
waited
till
i
see
no
fun
i
waiting
so
i
parted
with
my
public
and
my
ferrets
for
she
was
dead
a
ready
my
wife
was
and
i
had
no
cumbrance
and
off
i
started
a
pretty
long
walk
to
this
for
i
could
walk
for
a
wager
in
them
days
ah
well
here
we
are
at
the
back
brewery
wall
put
down
your
paste
and
your
basket
now
old
boy
and
i
help
you
you
paste
and
i
give
you
the
bills
and
then
you
can
go
on
talking
tommy
obeyed
automatically
for
he
was
now
carried
away
by
the
rare
opportunity
of
talking
to
a
new
listener
and
was
only
eager
to
go
on
with
his
story
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
and
he
was
stooping
over
his
christian
with
quick
adroitness
exchanged
the
placards
in
his
own
bag
for
those
in
tommy
basket
christian
placards
had
not
been
printed
at
treby
but
were
a
new
lot
which
had
been
sent
from
duffield
that
very
day
highly
spiced
quorlen
had
said
coming
from
a
pen
that
was
up
to
that
sort
of
thing
christian
had
read
the
first
of
the
sheaf
and
supposed
they
were
all
alike
he
proceeded
to
hand
one
to
tommy
and
said
here
old
boy
paste
this
over
the
other
and
so
when
you
got
into
this
what
did
you
do
why
i
put
up
at
a
good
public
and
ordered
the
best
for
i
a
bit
money
in
my
pocket
and
i
axed
about
and
they
said
to
me
if
trounsem
business
you
after
you
go
to
lawyer
jermyn
and
i
went
and
says
i
going
along
he
maybe
the
fine
man
as
walked
me
up
and
down
but
no
such
thing
i
tell
you
what
lawyer
jermyn
was
he
stands
you
there
and
holds
you
away
from
him
wi
a
pole
three
yard
long
he
stares
at
you
and
says
nothing
till
you
feel
like
a
tomfool
and
then
he
threats
you
to
set
the
justice
on
you
and
then
he
sorry
for
you
and
hands
you
money
and
preaches
you
a
sarmint
and
tells
you
you
a
poor
man
and
he
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
and
you
better
not
be
meddling
wi
things
belonging
to
the
law
else
you
be
catched
up
in
a
big
wheel
and
fly
to
bits
and
i
went
of
a
cold
sweat
and
i
wished
i
might
never
come
i
sight
o
lawyer
jermyn
again
but
he
says
if
you
keep
i
this
neighborhood
behave
yourself
well
and
i
pertect
you
i
were
deep
enough
but
it
no
use
being
deep
you
can
never
know
the
law
and
there
times
when
the
deepest
fellow
most
frightened
yes
yes
there
now
for
another
placard
and
so
that
was
all
all
said
tommy
turning
round
and
holding
the
in
suspense
do
you
be
running
too
quick
thinks
i
meddle
no
more
got
a
bit
o
money
i
buy
a
basket
and
be
a
it
a
pleasant
life
i
shall
live
at
publics
and
see
the
world
and
pick
and
get
a
chance
penny
but
when
i
turned
into
the
red
lion
and
got
myself
warm
again
wi
a
drop
o
hot
something
jumps
into
my
head
thinks
i
tommy
you
done
finely
for
yourself
you
a
rat
as
has
broke
up
your
house
to
take
a
journey
and
show
yourself
to
a
ferret
and
then
it
jumps
into
my
head
i
once
two
ferrets
as
turned
on
one
another
and
the
little
un
killed
the
big
un
says
i
to
the
landlady
could
you
tell
me
of
a
lawyer
says
i
very
big
or
fine
but
a
a
like
i
can
says
she
one
now
in
the
bar
parlor
so
kind
as
bring
us
together
says
i
and
she
cries
out
i
think
i
hear
her
now
johnson
and
what
do
you
think
at
this
crisis
in
tommy
story
the
gray
clouds
which
had
been
gradually
thinning
opened
sufficiently
to
let
down
the
sudden
moonlight
and
show
his
poor
battered
old
figure
and
face
in
the
attitude
and
with
the
expression
of
a
narrator
sure
of
the
coming
effect
on
his
auditor
his
body
and
neck
stretched
a
little
on
one
side
and
his
held
out
with
an
alarming
intention
of
tapping
christian
at
the
right
moment
christian
started
to
a
safe
distance
and
said
it
wonderful
i
ca
tell
what
to
think
then
never
do
you
deny
old
nick
said
tommy
with
solemnity
believed
in
him
more
ever
since
who
was
johnson
why
johnson
was
the
fine
man
as
had
walked
me
up
and
down
with
questions
and
i
out
with
it
to
him
then
and
there
and
he
speaks
me
civil
and
says
away
me
my
good
fellow
and
he
told
me
a
deal
o
law
and
he
says
you
a
tommy
trounsem
or
no
it
no
good
to
you
but
only
to
them
as
have
got
hold
o
the
property
if
you
was
a
tommy
trounsem
twenty
times
over
it
be
no
good
for
the
law
bought
you
out
and
your
no
good
only
to
them
as
have
catched
hold
o
the
property
the
more
you
live
the
more
they
stick
in
not
as
they
want
you
now
says
he
no
good
to
anybody
and
you
might
howl
like
a
dog
foriver
and
the
law
take
no
notice
on
you
says
johnson
doing
a
kind
thing
by
you
to
tell
you
for
that
the
law
and
if
you
want
to
know
the
law
master
you
ask
johnson
i
heard
say
after
as
he
was
an
understrapper
at
jermyn
i
never
forgot
it
from
that
day
to
this
but
i
saw
clear
enough
as
if
the
law
had
been
again
me
the
trounsem
estate
ha
been
mine
but
folks
are
fools
hereabouts
and
i
left
off
talking
the
more
you
tell
the
truth
the
more
niver
believe
you
and
i
went
and
bought
my
basket
and
the
pots
and
come
then
fire
away
said
christian
here
another
placard
i
getting
a
bit
dry
master
well
then
make
haste
and
you
have
something
to
drink
all
the
sooner
tommy
turned
to
his
work
again
and
christian
continuing
his
help
said
and
how
long
has
jermyn
been
employing
you
oh
no
particular
time
off
and
on
but
a
week
or
two
ago
he
sees
me
upo
the
road
and
speaks
to
me
uncommon
civil
and
tells
me
to
go
up
to
his
office
and
he
give
me
employ
and
i
was
noways
unwilling
to
stick
the
bills
to
get
the
family
into
for
there
no
man
can
help
the
law
and
the
family
the
family
whether
you
carry
pots
or
no
master
i
uncommon
dry
my
head
round
it
talking
so
long
on
end
the
unwonted
excitement
of
poor
tommy
memory
was
producing
a
reaction
well
tommy
said
christian
who
had
just
made
a
discovery
among
the
placards
which
altered
the
bent
of
his
thoughts
you
may
go
back
to
the
now
if
you
like
here
a
for
you
to
spend
handsomely
i
ca
go
back
there
myself
just
yet
but
you
may
give
my
respects
to
spilkins
and
mind
you
paste
the
rest
of
the
bills
early
morning
ay
ay
but
do
you
believe
too
much
i
spilkins
said
tommy
pocketing
the
and
showing
his
gratitude
by
giving
this
advice
he
no
harm
much
but
weak
he
thinks
he
at
the
bottom
things
because
he
scores
you
up
but
i
bear
him
no
tommy
trounsem
a
good
chap
and
any
day
you
like
to
give
me
i
tell
you
the
same
story
over
again
not
now
i
dry
come
help
me
up
wi
these
things
you
a
younger
chap
than
me
well
i
tell
spilkins
you
come
again
another
day
the
moonlight
which
had
lit
up
poor
tommy
oratorical
attitude
had
served
to
light
up
for
christian
the
print
of
the
placards
he
had
expected
the
copies
to
be
various
and
had
turned
them
half
over
at
different
depths
of
the
sheaf
before
drawing
out
those
he
offered
to
the
suddenly
the
clearer
light
had
shown
him
on
one
of
them
a
name
which
was
just
then
especially
interesting
to
him
and
all
the
more
when
occurring
in
a
placard
intended
to
dissuade
the
electors
of
north
loamshire
from
voting
for
the
heir
of
the
transomes
he
hastily
turned
over
the
bills
that
preceded
and
succeeded
that
he
might
draw
out
and
carry
away
all
of
this
pattern
for
it
might
turn
out
to
be
wiser
for
him
not
to
contribute
to
the
publicity
of
handbills
which
contained
allusions
to
bycliffe
transome
there
were
about
a
dozen
of
them
he
pressed
them
together
and
thrust
them
into
his
pocket
returning
all
the
rest
to
tommy
basket
to
take
away
this
dozen
might
not
be
to
prevent
similar
bills
from
being
posted
up
elsewhere
but
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
these
were
all
of
the
same
kind
which
had
been
sent
to
treby
from
duffield
christian
interest
in
his
practical
joke
had
died
out
like
a
morning
rushlight
apart
from
this
discovery
in
the
placards
old
tommy
story
had
some
indications
in
it
that
were
worth
pondering
over
where
was
that
johnson
now
was
he
still
an
understrapper
of
jermyn
with
this
matter
in
his
thoughts
christian
only
turned
in
hastily
at
quorlen
threw
down
the
black
bag
which
contained
the
captured
radical
handbills
said
he
had
done
the
job
and
hurried
back
to
the
manor
that
he
might
study
his
problem
chapter
xxix
i
doe
believe
that
as
the
gall
has
severall
receptacles
in
several
creatures
soe
there
scarce
any
creature
but
hath
that
emunctorye
sir
thomas
browne
fancy
what
a
game
at
chess
would
be
if
all
the
chessmen
had
passions
and
intellects
more
or
less
small
and
cunning
if
you
were
not
only
uncertain
about
your
adversary
men
but
a
little
uncertain
about
your
own
if
your
knight
could
shuffle
himself
on
to
a
new
square
by
the
sly
if
your
bishop
in
disgust
at
your
castling
could
wheedle
your
pawns
out
of
their
places
and
if
your
pawns
hating
you
because
they
are
pawns
could
make
away
from
their
appointed
posts
that
you
might
get
checkmate
on
a
sudden
you
might
be
the
of
deductive
reasoners
and
yet
you
might
be
beaten
by
your
own
pawns
you
would
be
especially
likely
to
be
beat
if
you
depended
arrogantly
on
your
mathematical
imagination
and
regarded
your
passionate
pieces
with
contempt
yet
this
imaginary
chess
is
easy
compared
with
the
game
a
man
has
to
play
against
his
with
other
for
his
instruments
he
thinks
himself
sagacious
perhaps
because
he
trusts
no
bond
except
that
of
but
the
only
he
can
safely
rely
on
is
what
seems
to
be
such
to
the
mind
he
would
use
or
govern
can
he
ever
be
sure
of
knowing
this
matthew
jermyn
was
under
no
misgivings
as
to
the
fealty
of
johnson
he
had
been
the
making
of
johnson
and
this
seems
to
many
men
as
a
reason
for
expecting
devotion
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
themselves
though
very
fond
of
their
own
persons
and
lives
are
not
at
all
devoted
to
the
maker
they
believe
in
johnson
was
a
most
serviceable
subordinate
being
a
man
who
aimed
at
respectability
a
family
man
who
had
a
good
subscribed
for
engravings
of
banquet
pictures
where
there
were
portraits
of
political
celebrities
and
wished
his
children
to
be
more
unquestionably
genteel
than
their
father
he
presented
all
the
more
numerous
handles
of
worldly
motive
by
which
a
judicious
superior
might
get
a
hold
on
him
but
this
useful
regard
to
respectability
had
its
inconvenience
in
relation
to
such
a
superior
it
was
a
mark
of
some
vanity
and
some
pride
which
if
they
were
not
touched
just
in
the
right
were
liable
to
become
raw
and
sensitive
jermyn
was
aware
of
johnson
weaknesses
and
thought
he
had
flattered
them
sufficiently
but
on
the
point
of
knowing
when
we
are
disagreeable
our
human
nature
is
fallible
our
our
smiles
our
compliments
and
other
polite
falsities
are
constantly
offensive
when
in
the
very
nature
of
them
they
can
only
be
meant
to
attract
admiration
and
regard
jermyn
had
often
been
unconsciously
disagreeable
to
johnson
over
and
above
the
constant
offence
of
being
an
ostentatious
patron
he
would
never
let
johnson
dine
with
his
wife
and
daughters
he
would
not
himself
dine
at
johnson
house
when
he
was
in
town
he
often
did
what
was
equivalent
to
poohpoohing
his
conversation
by
not
even
appearing
to
listen
and
by
suddenly
cutting
it
short
with
a
query
on
a
new
subject
jermyn
was
able
and
politic
enough
to
have
commanded
a
great
deal
of
success
in
his
life
but
he
could
not
help
being
handsome
arrogant
fond
of
being
heard
indisposed
to
any
kind
of
comradeship
amorous
and
bland
toward
women
cold
and
toward
men
you
will
hear
very
strong
denials
that
an
attorney
being
handsome
could
enter
into
the
dislike
he
excited
but
conversation
consists
a
good
deal
in
the
denial
of
what
is
true
from
the
british
point
of
view
masculine
beauty
is
regarded
very
much
as
it
is
in
the
drapery
business
as
good
solely
for
the
fancy
department
for
young
noblemen
artists
poets
and
the
clergy
some
one
who
like
lingon
was
disposed
to
revile
jermyn
perhaps
it
was
sir
maximus
had
called
him
a
cursed
sleek
handsome
overbearing
sycophant
epithets
which
expressed
rather
confusedly
the
mingled
character
of
the
dislike
he
excited
and
serviceable
john
johnson
himself
sleek
and
mindful
about
his
broadcloth
and
his
cambric
fronts
had
what
he
considered
spirit
enough
within
him
to
feel
that
dislike
of
jermyn
gradually
gathering
force
through
years
of
obligation
and
subjection
till
it
had
become
an
actuating
motive
disposed
to
use
an
opportunity
if
it
did
not
watch
for
one
it
was
not
this
motive
however
but
rather
the
ordinary
course
of
business
which
accounted
for
johnson
playing
a
double
part
as
an
electioneering
agent
what
men
do
in
elections
is
not
to
be
classed
either
among
sins
or
marks
of
grace
it
would
be
profane
to
include
business
in
religion
and
conscience
refers
to
failure
not
to
success
still
the
sense
of
being
galled
by
jermyn
harness
was
an
additional
reason
for
cultivating
all
relations
that
were
independent
of
him
and
pique
at
harold
transome
behavior
to
him
in
jermyn
office
perhaps
gave
all
the
more
zest
to
johnson
use
of
his
pen
and
ink
when
he
wrote
a
handbill
in
the
service
of
garstin
and
garstin
incomparable
agent
putty
full
of
innuendoes
against
harold
transome
as
a
descendant
of
the
it
is
a
natural
subject
of
to
a
man
when
special
knowledge
gained
long
ago
without
any
forecast
turns
out
to
afford
a
special
inspiration
in
the
present
and
johnson
felt
a
new
pleasure
in
the
consciousness
that
he
of
all
people
in
the
world
next
to
jermyn
had
the
most
intimate
knowledge
of
the
transome
affairs
still
better
some
of
these
affairs
were
secrets
of
jermyn
if
in
an
uncomplimentary
spirit
he
might
have
been
called
jermyn
man
of
straw
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
know
that
the
unreality
of
the
man
john
johnson
was
confined
to
his
appearance
in
annuity
deeds
and
that
elsewhere
he
was
solid
locomotive
and
capable
of
remembering
anything
for
his
own
pleasure
and
benefit
to
act
with
doubleness
towards
a
man
whose
conduct
was
double
was
so
near
an
approach
to
virtue
that
it
deserved
to
be
called
by
no
meaner
name
than
diplomacy
by
such
causes
it
came
to
pass
that
christian
held
in
his
hands
a
bill
in
which
jermyn
was
playfully
alluded
to
as
german
cozen
who
won
games
by
clever
shuffling
and
odd
tricks
without
any
honor
and
backed
durfey
crib
against
bycliffe
in
which
it
was
adroitly
implied
that
the
head
of
the
transomes
was
only
the
tail
of
the
durfeys
and
that
some
said
the
durfeys
would
have
died
out
and
left
their
nest
empty
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
german
cozen
johnson
had
not
dared
to
use
any
recollections
except
such
as
might
credibly
exist
in
other
minds
besides
his
own
in
the
truth
of
the
case
no
one
but
himself
had
the
prompting
to
recall
these
scandals
but
it
was
likely
enough
that
such
things
should
be
revived
by
election
heats
for
johnson
to
escape
all
suspicion
christian
could
gather
only
dim
and
uncertain
inferences
from
this
flat
irony
and
heavy
joking
but
one
chief
thing
was
clear
to
him
he
had
been
right
in
his
conjecture
that
jermyn
interest
about
bycliffe
had
its
source
in
some
claim
of
bycliffe
on
the
transome
property
and
then
there
was
that
story
of
the
old
which
closely
considered
indicated
that
the
right
of
the
present
transomes
depended
or
at
least
had
depended
on
the
continuance
of
some
other
lives
christian
in
his
time
had
gathered
enough
legal
notions
to
be
aware
that
possession
by
one
man
sometimes
depended
on
the
life
of
another
that
a
man
might
sell
his
own
interest
in
property
and
the
interest
of
his
descendants
while
a
claim
on
that
property
would
still
remain
to
some
one
else
than
the
purchaser
supposing
the
descendants
became
extinct
and
the
interests
they
had
sold
were
at
an
end
but
under
what
conditions
the
claim
might
be
valid
or
void
in
any
particular
case
was
all
darkness
to
him
suppose
bycliffe
had
any
such
claim
on
the
transome
estates
how
was
christian
to
know
whether
at
the
present
moment
it
was
worth
anything
more
than
a
bit
of
rotten
parchment
old
tommy
trounsem
had
said
that
johnson
knew
all
about
it
but
even
if
johnson
were
still
and
all
johnsons
are
mortal
he
might
still
be
an
understrapper
of
jermyn
in
which
case
his
knowledge
would
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
hedge
for
the
purposes
of
henry
scaddon
his
immediate
care
must
be
to
find
out
all
he
could
about
johnson
he
blamed
himself
for
not
having
questioned
tommy
further
while
he
had
him
at
command
but
on
this
head
the
could
hardly
know
more
than
the
less
dilapidated
denizens
of
treby
now
it
had
happened
that
during
the
weeks
in
which
christian
had
been
at
work
trying
to
solve
the
enigma
of
jermyn
interest
about
bycliffe
johnson
mind
also
had
been
somewhat
occupied
with
suspicion
and
conjecture
as
to
new
information
on
the
subject
of
the
old
bycliffe
claims
which
jermyn
intended
to
conceal
from
him
the
letter
which
after
his
interview
with
christian
jermyn
had
written
with
a
sense
of
perfect
safety
to
his
faithful
ally
johnson
was
as
we
know
written
to
a
johnson
who
had
found
his
incompatible
with
that
faithfulness
of
which
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
foundation
anything
that
the
patron
felt
it
inconvenient
for
his
obliged
friend
and
servant
to
know
became
by
that
very
fact
an
object
of
peculiar
curiosity
the
obliged
friend
and
servant
secretly
doted
on
his
patron
inconvenience
provided
that
he
himself
did
not
share
it
and
conjecture
naturally
became
active
johnson
legal
imagination
being
very
differently
furnished
from
christian
was
at
no
loss
to
conceive
conditions
under
which
there
might
arise
a
new
claim
on
the
transome
estates
he
had
before
him
the
whole
history
of
the
settlement
of
those
estates
made
a
hundred
years
ago
by
john
justus
transome
entailing
them
whilst
in
his
possession
on
his
son
thomas
and
his
with
remainder
to
the
bycliffes
in
fee
he
knew
that
thomas
son
of
john
justus
proving
a
prodigal
had
without
the
knowledge
of
his
father
the
tenant
in
possession
sold
his
own
and
his
descendants
rights
to
a
named
durfey
that
therefore
the
title
of
the
in
spite
of
that
old
durfey
tricks
to
show
the
contrary
depended
solely
on
the
purchase
of
the
base
fee
thus
created
by
thomas
transome
and
that
the
bycliffes
were
the
remainder
men
who
might
fairly
oust
the
if
ever
the
issue
of
the
prodigal
thomas
went
clean
out
of
existence
and
ceased
to
represent
a
right
which
he
had
bargained
away
from
them
johnson
as
jermyn
subordinate
had
been
closely
cognizant
of
the
details
concerning
the
suit
instituted
by
successive
bycliffes
of
whom
maurice
christian
bycliffe
was
the
last
on
the
plea
that
the
extinction
of
thomas
transome
line
had
actually
come
to
pass
a
weary
suit
which
had
eaten
into
the
fortunes
of
two
families
and
had
only
made
the
cankerworms
fat
the
suit
had
closed
with
the
death
of
maurice
christian
bycliffe
in
prison
but
before
his
death
jermyn
exertions
to
get
evidence
that
there
was
still
issue
of
thomas
transome
line
surviving
as
a
security
of
the
durfey
title
had
issued
in
the
discovery
of
a
thomas
transome
at
littleshaw
in
stonyshire
who
was
the
representative
of
the
pawned
inheritance
the
death
of
maurice
had
made
this
discovery
useless
had
made
it
seem
the
wiser
part
to
say
nothing
about
it
and
the
fact
had
remained
a
secret
known
only
to
jermyn
and
johnson
no
other
bycliffe
was
known
or
believed
to
exist
and
the
might
be
considered
safe
unless
yes
there
was
an
unless
which
johnson
could
conceive
an
heir
or
heiress
of
the
bycliffes
if
such
a
personage
turned
out
to
be
in
existence
might
sometime
raise
a
new
and
valid
claim
when
once
informed
that
wretched
old
tommy
trounsem
the
tottering
drunkenly
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
was
the
last
issue
remaining
from
that
dissolute
thomas
who
played
his
esau
part
a
century
before
while
the
poor
old
breathed
the
could
legally
keep
their
possession
in
spite
of
a
possible
bycliffe
proved
real
but
not
when
the
parish
had
buried
the
still
it
is
one
thing
to
conceive
conditions
and
another
to
see
any
chance
of
proving
their
existence
johnson
at
present
had
no
glimpse
of
such
a
chance
and
even
if
he
ever
gained
the
glimpse
he
was
not
sure
that
he
should
ever
make
any
use
of
it
his
enquiries
of
medwin
in
obedience
to
jermyn
letter
had
extracted
only
a
negative
as
to
any
information
possessed
by
the
lawyers
of
bycliffe
concerning
a
marriage
or
expectation
of
offspring
on
his
part
but
johnson
felt
not
the
less
stung
by
curiosity
to
know
what
jermyn
had
found
out
that
he
had
found
something
in
relation
to
a
possible
bycliffe
johnson
felt
pretty
sure
and
he
thought
with
satisfaction
that
jermyn
could
not
hinder
him
from
knowing
what
he
already
knew
about
thomas
transome
issue
many
things
might
occur
to
alter
his
policy
and
give
a
new
value
to
facts
was
it
certain
that
jermyn
would
always
be
fortunate
when
greed
and
unscrupulousness
exhibit
themselves
on
a
grand
historical
scale
and
there
is
a
question
of
peace
or
war
or
amicable
partition
it
often
occurs
that
gentlemen
of
high
diplomatic
talents
have
their
minds
bent
on
the
same
object
from
different
points
of
view
each
perhaps
is
thinking
of
a
certain
duchy
or
province
with
a
view
to
arranging
the
ownership
in
such
a
way
as
shall
best
serve
the
purposes
of
the
gentleman
with
high
diplomatic
talents
in
whom
each
is
more
especially
interested
but
these
select
minds
in
high
office
can
never
miss
their
aims
from
ignorance
of
each
other
existence
or
whereabouts
their
high
titles
may
be
learned
even
by
common
people
from
every
pocket
almanac
but
with
meaner
diplomats
who
might
be
mutually
useful
such
ignorance
is
often
obstructive
john
johnson
and
christian
otherwise
scaddon
might
have
had
a
concentration
of
purpose
and
an
ingenuity
of
device
fitting
them
to
make
a
figure
in
the
parcelling
of
europe
and
yet
they
might
never
have
met
simply
because
johnson
knew
nothing
of
christian
and
because
christian
did
not
know
where
to
find
johnson
chapter
xxx
his
nature
is
too
noble
for
the
world
he
would
not
flatter
neptune
for
his
trident
or
jove
for
his
power
to
thunder
his
heart
his
mouth
what
his
breast
forges
that
his
tongue
must
vent
and
being
angry
doth
forget
that
ever
he
heard
the
name
of
christian
and
johnson
did
meet
however
by
means
that
were
quite
incalculable
the
incident
which
brought
them
into
communication
was
due
to
felix
holt
who
of
all
men
in
the
world
had
the
least
affinity
either
for
the
industrious
or
the
idle
parasite
lyon
had
urged
felix
to
go
to
duffield
on
the
fifteenth
of
december
to
witness
the
nomination
of
the
candidates
for
north
loamshire
the
minister
wished
to
hear
what
took
place
and
the
pleasure
of
gratifying
him
helped
to
outweigh
some
opposing
reasons
i
shall
get
into
a
rage
at
something
or
other
felix
had
said
told
you
one
of
my
weak
points
where
i
have
any
particular
business
i
must
incur
the
risks
my
nature
brings
but
i
no
particular
business
at
duffield
however
i
make
a
holiday
and
go
by
dint
of
seeing
folly
i
shall
get
lessons
in
patience
the
weak
point
to
which
felix
referred
was
his
liability
to
be
carried
completely
out
of
his
own
mastery
by
indignant
anger
his
strong
health
his
renunciation
of
selfish
claims
his
habitual
preoccupation
with
large
thoughts
and
with
purposes
independent
of
everyday
casualties
secured
him
a
fine
and
even
temper
free
from
moodiness
or
irritability
he
was
full
of
toward
his
unwise
mother
who
pressed
him
daily
with
her
words
and
urged
him
so
that
his
soul
was
vexed
he
had
chosen
to
fill
his
days
in
a
way
that
required
the
utmost
exertion
of
patience
that
required
those
little
outflowings
of
goodness
which
in
minds
of
great
energy
must
be
fed
from
deep
sources
of
thought
and
passionate
devotedness
in
this
way
his
energies
served
to
make
him
gentle
and
now
in
this
year
of
his
life
they
had
ceased
to
make
him
angry
except
in
the
presence
of
something
that
roused
his
deep
indignation
when
once
exasperated
the
passionateness
of
his
nature
threw
off
the
yoke
of
a
consciousness
in
which
thought
and
emotion
had
been
more
and
more
completely
mingled
and
concentrated
itself
in
a
rage
as
ungovernable
as
that
of
boyhood
he
was
thoroughly
aware
of
the
liability
and
knew
that
in
such
circumstances
he
could
not
answer
for
himself
sensitive
people
with
feeble
frames
have
often
the
same
sort
of
fury
within
them
but
they
are
themselves
shattered
and
shatter
nothing
felix
had
a
terrible
arm
he
knew
that
he
was
dangerous
and
he
avoided
the
conditions
that
might
cause
him
exasperation
as
he
would
have
avoided
intoxicating
drinks
if
he
had
been
in
danger
of
intemperance
the
was
a
great
epoch
of
successful
trickery
or
to
speak
in
a
more
parliamentary
manner
of
on
the
part
of
skilful
agents
and
johnson
had
his
share
of
inward
chuckling
and
as
one
who
might
justly
expect
increasing
renown
and
be
some
day
in
as
general
request
as
the
great
putty
himself
to
have
the
pleasure
and
the
praise
of
electioneering
ingenuity
and
also
to
get
paid
for
it
without
too
much
anxiety
whether
the
ingenuity
will
achieve
its
ultimate
end
perhaps
gives
to
some
select
persons
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
their
superiority
to
their
more
agitated
that
is
worthy
to
be
classed
with
those
generous
enjoyments
of
having
the
truth
chiefly
to
yourself
and
of
seeing
others
in
danger
of
drowning
while
you
are
high
and
dry
which
seem
to
have
been
regarded
as
unmixed
privileges
by
lucretius
and
lord
bacon
one
of
johnson
great
successes
was
this
spratt
the
hated
manager
of
the
sproxton
colliery
in
careless
confidence
that
the
colliers
and
other
laborers
under
him
would
follow
his
orders
had
provided
carts
to
carry
some
loads
of
voteless
enthusiasm
to
duffield
on
behalf
of
garstin
enthusiasm
which
being
already
paid
for
by
the
recognized
benefit
of
garstin
existence
as
a
capitalist
with
a
share
in
the
sproxton
mines
was
not
to
cost
much
in
the
form
of
treating
a
capitalist
was
held
worthy
of
pious
honor
as
the
cause
why
workingmen
existed
but
spratt
did
not
sufficiently
consider
that
a
cause
which
was
to
be
proved
by
argument
or
testimony
is
not
an
object
of
passionate
devotion
to
colliers
a
visible
cause
of
beer
acts
on
them
much
more
strongly
and
even
if
there
had
been
any
love
of
the
garstin
hatred
of
the
too
immediate
spratt
would
have
been
the
stronger
motive
hence
johnson
calculations
made
long
ago
with
chubb
the
remarkable
publican
had
been
well
founded
and
there
had
been
diligent
care
to
supply
treating
at
duffield
in
the
name
of
transome
after
the
election
was
over
it
was
not
improbable
that
there
would
be
much
friendly
joking
between
putty
and
johnson
as
to
the
success
of
this
trick
against
putty
employer
and
johnson
would
be
conscious
of
rising
in
the
opinion
of
his
celebrated
senior
for
the
show
of
hands
and
the
cheering
the
hustling
and
the
pelting
the
roaring
and
the
hissing
the
hard
hits
with
small
missiles
and
the
soft
hits
with
small
jokes
were
strong
enough
on
the
side
of
transome
to
balance
the
similar
demonstrations
for
garstin
even
with
the
debarry
interest
in
his
favor
and
the
inconvenient
presence
of
spratt
was
easily
got
rid
of
by
a
accident
which
sent
him
bruised
and
limping
from
the
scene
of
action
chubb
had
never
before
felt
so
thoroughly
that
the
occasion
was
up
to
a
level
with
his
talents
while
the
clear
daylight
in
which
his
virtue
would
appear
when
at
the
election
he
voted
as
his
duty
to
himself
bound
him
for
garstin
only
gave
him
thorough
repose
of
conscience
felix
holt
was
the
only
person
looking
on
at
the
senseless
exhibitions
of
this
who
knew
from
the
beginning
the
history
of
the
trick
with
the
sproxton
men
he
had
been
aware
all
along
that
the
treating
at
chubb
had
been
continued
and
that
so
far
harold
transome
promise
had
produced
no
good
fruits
and
what
he
was
observing
as
he
watched
the
uproarious
crowd
convinced
him
that
the
whole
scheme
would
be
carried
out
just
as
if
he
had
never
spoken
about
it
he
could
be
fair
enough
to
transome
to
allow
that
he
might
have
wished
and
yet
have
been
unable
with
his
notions
of
success
to
keep
his
promise
and
his
bitterness
toward
the
candidate
only
took
the
form
of
contemptuous
pity
for
felix
was
not
sparing
in
his
contempt
for
men
who
put
their
inward
honor
in
pawn
by
seeking
the
prizes
of
the
world
his
scorn
fell
too
readily
on
the
fortunate
but
when
he
saw
johnson
passing
to
and
fro
and
speaking
to
jermyn
on
the
hustings
he
felt
himself
getting
angry
and
jumped
off
the
wheel
of
the
stationary
cart
on
which
he
was
mounted
that
he
might
no
longer
be
in
sight
of
this
man
whose
vitiating
cant
had
made
his
blood
hot
and
his
fingers
tingle
on
the
first
day
of
encountering
him
at
sproxton
it
was
a
little
too
exasperating
to
look
at
this
rotund
specimen
of
prosperity
to
witness
the
power
for
evil
that
lay
in
his
vulgar
cant
backed
by
another
man
money
and
to
know
that
such
stupid
iniquity
flourished
the
flags
of
reform
and
liberalism
and
justice
to
the
needy
while
the
roaring
and
the
scuffling
were
still
going
on
felix
with
his
thick
stick
in
his
hand
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
walked
on
through
the
duffield
streets
till
he
came
out
on
a
grassy
suburb
where
the
houses
surrounded
a
small
common
here
he
walked
about
in
the
breezy
air
and
ate
his
bread
and
apples
telling
himself
that
this
angry
haste
of
his
about
evils
that
could
only
be
remedied
slowly
could
be
nothing
else
than
obstructive
and
might
some
day
he
saw
it
so
clearly
that
the
thought
seemed
like
a
presentiment
be
obstructive
of
his
own
work
not
to
waste
energy
to
apply
force
where
it
would
tell
to
do
small
work
close
at
hand
not
waiting
for
speculative
chances
of
heroism
but
preparing
for
them
these
were
the
rules
he
had
been
constantly
urging
on
himself
but
what
could
be
a
greater
waste
than
to
beat
a
scoundrel
who
had
law
and
opodeldoc
at
command
after
this
meditation
felix
felt
cool
and
wise
enough
to
return
into
the
town
not
however
intending
to
deny
himself
the
satisfaction
of
a
few
pungent
words
wherever
there
was
place
for
them
blows
are
sarcasms
turned
stupid
wit
is
a
form
of
force
that
leaves
the
limbs
at
rest
anything
that
could
be
called
a
crowd
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
the
show
of
hands
having
been
pronounced
to
be
in
favor
of
debarry
and
transome
and
a
poll
having
been
demanded
for
garstin
the
business
of
the
day
might
be
considered
at
an
end
but
in
the
street
where
the
hustings
were
erected
and
where
the
great
hotels
stood
there
were
many
groups
as
well
as
strollers
and
steady
walkers
to
and
fro
men
in
superior
greatcoats
and
hats
were
awaiting
with
more
or
less
impatience
an
important
dinner
either
at
the
crown
which
was
house
or
at
the
three
cranes
which
was
garstin
or
at
the
fox
and
hounds
which
was
transome
knots
of
sober
retailers
who
had
already
dined
were
to
be
seen
at
some
men
in
very
shabby
coats
and
miscellaneous
inhabitants
of
duffield
and
not
county
voters
were
lounging
about
in
dull
silence
or
listening
some
to
a
grimy
man
in
a
flannel
shirt
hatless
and
with
turbid
red
hair
who
was
insisting
on
political
points
with
much
more
ease
than
had
seemed
to
belong
to
the
gentlemen
speakers
on
the
hustings
and
others
to
a
scotch
vendor
of
articles
useful
to
sell
whose
unfamiliar
accent
seemed
to
have
a
guarantee
of
truth
in
it
wanting
as
an
association
with
everyday
english
some
or
distinguished
chose
to
walk
up
and
down
in
isolation
and
silence
but
the
majority
of
those
who
had
shown
a
burning
interest
in
the
nomination
had
disappeared
and
cockades
no
longer
studded
a
crowd
like
and
also
very
unlike
among
the
grass
the
street
pavement
was
strangely
painted
with
fragments
of
perishable
missiles
ground
flat
under
heavy
feet
but
the
workers
were
resting
from
their
toil
and
the
buzz
and
tread
and
the
fitfully
discernible
voices
seemed
like
stillness
to
felix
after
the
roar
with
which
the
wide
space
had
been
filled
when
he
left
it
the
group
round
the
speaker
in
the
flannel
shirt
stood
at
the
corner
of
a
and
the
speaker
himself
was
elevated
by
the
head
and
shoulders
above
his
hearers
not
because
he
was
tall
but
because
he
stood
on
a
projecting
stone
at
the
opposite
corner
of
the
turning
was
the
great
inn
of
the
fox
and
hounds
and
this
was
the
quarter
of
the
high
street
felix
was
at
once
attracted
by
this
group
he
liked
the
look
of
the
speaker
whose
bare
arms
were
powerfully
muscular
though
he
had
the
pallid
complexion
of
a
man
who
lives
chiefly
amidst
the
heat
of
furnaces
he
was
leaning
against
the
dark
stone
building
behind
him
with
folded
arms
the
grimy
paleness
of
his
shirt
and
skin
standing
out
in
high
relief
against
the
dark
stone
building
behind
him
he
lifted
up
one
forefinger
and
marked
his
emphasis
with
it
as
he
spoke
his
voice
was
high
and
not
strong
but
felix
recognized
the
fluency
and
the
method
of
an
habitual
preacher
or
lecturer
it
the
fallacy
of
all
monopolists
he
was
saying
we
know
what
monopolists
are
men
who
want
to
keep
a
trade
all
to
themselves
under
the
pretence
that
they
furnish
the
public
with
a
better
article
we
know
what
that
comes
to
in
some
countries
a
poor
man
ca
afford
to
buy
a
spoonful
of
salt
and
yet
there
salt
enough
in
the
world
to
pickle
every
living
thing
in
it
that
the
sort
of
benefit
monopolists
do
to
mankind
and
these
are
the
men
who
tell
us
we
to
let
politics
alone
they
govern
us
better
without
our
knowing
anything
about
it
we
must
mind
our
business
we
are
ignorant
we
no
time
to
study
great
questions
but
i
tell
them
this
the
greatest
question
in
the
world
is
how
to
give
every
man
a
man
share
in
what
goes
on
in
life
hear
hear
said
felix
in
his
sonorous
voice
which
seemed
to
give
a
new
impressiveness
to
what
the
speaker
had
said
every
one
looked
at
him
the
face
and
its
educated
expression
along
with
a
dress
more
careless
than
that
of
most
workmen
on
a
holiday
made
his
appearance
strangely
arresting
not
a
pig
share
the
speaker
went
on
not
a
horse
not
the
share
of
a
machine
fed
with
oil
only
to
make
it
work
and
nothing
else
it
is
a
man
share
just
to
mind
your
or
your
and
higgle
about
your
own
wages
and
bring
up
your
family
to
be
ignorant
sons
of
ignorant
fathers
and
no
better
prospect
that
a
share
we
want
a
freeman
share
and
that
is
to
think
and
speak
and
act
about
what
concerns
us
all
and
see
whether
these
fine
gentlemen
who
undertake
to
govern
us
are
doing
the
best
they
can
for
us
they
got
the
knowledge
say
they
very
well
we
got
the
wants
there
many
a
one
would
be
idle
if
hunger
did
pinch
him
but
the
stomach
sets
us
to
work
there
a
fable
told
where
the
nobles
are
the
belly
and
the
people
the
members
but
i
make
another
sort
of
fable
i
say
we
are
the
belly
that
feels
the
pinches
and
we
set
these
aristocrats
these
great
people
who
call
themselves
our
brains
to
work
at
some
way
of
satisfying
us
a
bit
better
the
aristocrats
are
pretty
sure
to
try
and
govern
for
their
own
benefit
but
how
are
we
to
be
sure
they
try
and
govern
for
ours
they
must
be
looked
after
i
think
like
other
workmen
we
must
have
what
we
call
inspectors
to
see
whether
the
work
well
done
for
us
we
want
to
send
our
inspectors
to
parliament
well
they
say
got
the
reform
bill
what
more
can
you
want
send
your
inspectors
but
i
say
the
reform
bill
is
a
trick
it
nothing
but
special
constables
to
keep
the
aristocrats
safe
in
their
monopoly
it
bribing
some
of
the
people
with
votes
to
make
them
hold
their
tongues
about
giving
votes
to
the
rest
i
say
if
a
man
does
beg
or
steal
but
works
for
his
bread
the
poorer
and
the
more
miserable
he
is
the
more
he
need
have
a
vote
to
send
an
inspector
to
parliament
else
the
man
who
is
worst
off
is
likely
to
be
forgotten
and
i
say
he
the
man
who
ought
to
be
first
remembered
else
what
does
their
religion
mean
why
do
they
build
churches
and
endow
them
that
their
sons
may
get
paid
well
for
preaching
a
saviour
and
making
themselves
as
little
like
him
as
can
be
if
i
want
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
i
must
shut
my
eyes
for
fear
i
should
see
a
parson
and
what
a
bishop
a
bishop
a
person
dressed
up
who
sits
in
the
house
of
lords
to
help
and
throw
out
reform
bills
and
because
it
hard
to
get
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
man
to
dress
himself
up
like
that
and
do
such
work
they
have
to
give
him
a
palace
for
it
and
plenty
of
thousands
and
then
they
cry
out
church
is
in
danger
poor
man
church
and
why
is
it
the
poor
man
church
because
he
can
have
a
seat
for
nothing
i
think
it
for
nothing
for
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
what
he
gets
by
it
if
the
poor
man
had
a
vote
in
the
matter
i
think
he
choose
a
different
sort
of
church
to
what
that
is
but
do
you
think
the
aristocrats
will
ever
alter
it
if
the
belly
does
pinch
them
not
they
it
part
of
their
monopoly
they
supply
us
with
our
religion
like
everything
else
and
get
a
profit
on
it
they
give
us
plenty
of
heaven
we
may
have
land
that
the
sort
of
religion
they
like
a
religion
that
gives
us
workingmen
heaven
and
nothing
else
but
we
offer
to
change
with
them
we
give
them
back
some
of
their
heaven
and
take
it
out
in
something
for
us
and
our
children
in
this
world
they
do
seem
to
care
so
much
about
heaven
themselves
till
they
feel
the
gout
very
bad
but
you
wo
get
them
to
give
up
anything
else
if
you
do
pinch
for
it
and
to
pinch
them
enough
we
must
get
the
suffrage
we
must
get
votes
that
we
may
send
the
men
to
parliament
who
will
do
our
work
for
us
and
we
must
have
parliament
dissolved
every
year
that
we
may
change
our
man
if
he
does
do
what
we
want
him
to
do
and
we
must
have
the
country
divided
so
that
the
little
kings
of
the
counties
ca
do
as
they
like
but
must
be
shaken
up
in
one
bag
with
us
i
say
if
we
workingmen
are
ever
to
get
a
man
share
we
must
have
universal
suffrage
and
annual
parliaments
and
the
vote
by
ballot
and
electoral
districts
no
something
else
before
all
that
said
felix
again
startling
the
audience
into
looking
at
him
but
the
speaker
glanced
coldly
at
him
and
went
on
that
what
sir
francis
burdett
went
in
for
fifteen
years
ago
and
the
right
thing
for
us
if
it
was
tomfool
who
went
in
for
it
you
must
lay
hold
of
such
handles
as
you
can
i
do
believe
much
in
liberal
aristocrats
but
if
there
any
fine
carved
stick
of
an
aristocrat
will
make
a
broomstick
of
himself
i
lose
no
time
but
sweep
with
him
and
that
what
i
think
about
transome
and
if
any
of
you
have
acquaintance
among
county
voters
give
a
hint
that
you
wish
to
vote
for
transome
at
the
last
word
the
speaker
stepped
down
from
his
slight
eminence
and
walked
away
rapidly
like
a
man
whose
leisure
was
exhausted
and
who
must
go
about
his
business
but
he
had
left
an
appetite
in
his
audience
for
further
oratory
and
one
of
them
seemed
to
express
a
general
sentiment
as
he
hurried
immediately
to
felix
and
said
come
sir
what
do
you
say
felix
did
at
once
what
he
would
very
likely
have
done
without
being
asked
he
stepped
on
the
stone
and
took
off
his
cap
by
an
instinctive
prompting
that
always
led
him
to
speak
uncovered
the
effect
of
his
figure
in
relief
against
the
stone
background
was
unlike
that
of
the
previous
speaker
he
was
considerably
taller
his
head
and
neck
were
more
massive
and
the
expression
of
his
mouth
and
eyes
was
something
very
different
from
the
mere
acuteness
and
rather
antagonism
of
the
man
felix
holt
face
had
the
look
of
habitual
meditative
abstraction
from
objects
of
mere
personal
vanity
or
desire
which
is
the
peculiar
stamp
of
culture
and
makes
a
very
face
worthy
to
be
called
the
human
face
divine
even
lions
and
dogs
know
a
distinction
between
men
glances
and
doubtless
those
duffield
men
in
the
expectation
with
which
they
looked
up
at
felix
were
unconsciously
influenced
by
the
grandeur
of
his
full
yet
firm
mouth
and
the
calm
clearness
of
his
gray
eyes
which
were
somehow
unlike
what
they
were
accustomed
to
see
along
with
an
old
brown
velveteen
coat
and
an
absence
of
when
he
began
to
speak
the
contrast
of
voice
was
still
stronger
than
that
of
appearance
the
man
in
the
flannel
shirt
had
not
been
heard
had
probably
not
cared
to
be
heard
beyond
the
immediate
group
of
listeners
but
felix
at
once
drew
the
attention
of
persons
comparatively
at
a
distance
in
my
opinion
he
said
almost
the
moment
after
he
was
addressed
that
was
a
true
word
spoken
by
your
friend
when
he
said
the
great
question
was
how
to
give
every
man
a
man
share
in
life
but
i
think
he
expects
voting
to
do
more
toward
it
than
i
do
i
want
the
workingmen
to
have
power
i
a
workingman
myself
and
i
do
want
to
be
anything
else
but
there
are
two
sorts
of
power
there
a
power
to
do
mischief
to
undo
what
has
been
done
with
great
expense
and
labor
to
waste
and
destroy
to
be
cruel
to
the
weak
to
lie
and
quarrel
and
to
talk
poisonous
nonsense
that
the
sort
of
power
that
ignorant
numbers
have
it
never
made
a
joint
stool
or
planted
a
potato
do
you
think
likely
to
do
much
toward
governing
a
great
country
and
making
wise
laws
and
giving
shelter
food
and
clothes
to
millions
of
men
ignorant
power
comes
in
the
end
to
the
same
thing
as
wicked
power
it
makes
misery
it
another
sort
of
power
that
i
want
us
workingmen
to
have
and
i
can
see
plainly
enough
that
our
all
having
votes
will
do
little
toward
it
at
present
i
hope
we
or
the
children
that
come
after
us
will
get
plenty
of
political
power
some
time
i
tell
everybody
plainly
i
hope
there
will
be
great
changes
and
that
some
time
whether
we
live
to
see
it
or
not
men
will
have
come
to
be
ashamed
of
things
proud
of
now
but
i
should
like
to
convince
you
that
votes
would
never
give
you
political
power
worth
having
while
things
are
as
they
are
now
and
that
if
you
go
the
right
way
to
work
you
may
get
power
sooner
without
votes
perhaps
all
you
who
hear
me
are
sober
men
who
try
to
learn
as
much
of
the
nature
of
things
as
you
can
and
to
be
as
little
like
fools
as
possible
a
fool
or
idiot
is
one
who
expects
things
to
happen
that
never
can
happen
he
pours
milk
into
a
can
without
a
bottom
and
expects
the
milk
to
stay
there
the
more
of
such
vain
expectations
a
man
has
the
more
he
is
a
fool
or
idiot
and
if
any
working
man
expects
a
vote
to
do
for
him
what
it
never
can
do
he
foolish
to
that
amount
if
no
more
i
think
that
clear
enough
eh
hear
hear
said
several
voices
but
they
were
not
those
of
the
original
group
they
belonged
to
some
strollers
who
had
been
attracted
by
felix
holt
vibrating
voice
and
were
tories
from
the
crown
among
them
was
christian
who
was
smoking
a
cigar
with
a
pleasure
he
always
felt
in
being
among
people
who
did
not
know
him
and
doubtless
took
him
to
be
something
higher
than
he
really
was
hearers
from
the
fox
and
hounds
also
were
slowly
adding
themselves
to
the
nucleus
felix
accessible
to
the
pleasure
of
being
listened
to
went
on
with
more
and
more
animation
the
way
to
get
rid
of
folly
is
to
get
rid
of
vain
expectations
and
of
thoughts
that
do
agree
with
the
nature
of
things
the
men
who
have
had
true
thoughts
about
water
and
what
it
will
do
when
it
is
turned
into
steam
and
under
all
sorts
of
circumstances
have
made
themselves
a
great
power
in
the
world
they
are
turning
the
wheels
of
engines
that
will
help
to
change
most
things
but
no
engines
would
have
done
if
there
had
been
false
notions
about
the
way
water
would
act
now
all
the
schemes
about
voting
and
districts
and
annual
parliaments
and
the
rest
are
engines
and
the
water
or
steam
the
force
that
is
to
work
them
must
come
out
of
human
nature
out
of
passions
feelings
desires
whether
the
engines
will
do
good
work
or
bad
depends
on
these
feelings
and
if
we
have
false
expectations
about
men
characters
we
are
very
much
like
the
idiot
who
thinks
he
carry
milk
in
a
can
without
a
bottom
in
my
opinion
the
notions
about
what
mere
voting
will
do
are
very
much
of
that
sort
that
very
fine
said
a
man
in
dirty
fustian
with
a
scornful
laugh
but
how
are
we
to
get
the
power
without
votes
i
tell
you
what
the
greatest
power
under
heaven
said
felix
and
that
is
public
opinion
the
ruling
belief
in
society
about
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
what
is
honorable
and
what
is
shameful
that
the
steam
that
is
to
work
the
engines
how
can
political
freedom
make
us
better
any
more
than
a
religion
we
do
believe
in
if
people
laugh
and
wink
when
they
see
men
abuse
and
defile
it
and
while
public
opinion
is
what
it
is
while
men
have
no
better
beliefs
about
public
duty
while
corruption
is
not
felt
to
be
a
damning
disgrace
while
men
are
not
ashamed
in
parliament
and
out
of
it
to
make
public
questions
which
concern
the
welfare
of
millions
a
mere
screen
for
their
own
petty
private
ends
i
say
no
fresh
scheme
of
voting
will
much
mend
our
condition
for
take
us
workingmen
of
all
sorts
suppose
out
of
every
hundred
who
had
a
vote
there
were
thirty
who
had
some
soberness
some
sense
to
choose
with
some
good
feeling
to
make
them
wish
the
right
thing
for
all
and
suppose
there
were
seventy
out
of
the
hundred
who
were
half
of
them
not
sober
who
had
no
sense
to
choose
one
thing
in
politics
more
than
another
and
who
had
so
little
good
feeling
in
them
that
they
wasted
on
their
own
drinking
the
money
that
should
have
helped
to
feed
and
clothe
their
wives
and
children
and
another
half
of
them
who
if
they
did
drink
were
too
ignorant
or
stupid
to
see
any
good
for
themselves
better
than
pocketing
a
piece
when
it
was
offered
them
where
would
be
the
political
power
of
the
thirty
sober
men
the
power
would
lie
with
the
seventy
drunken
and
stupid
votes
and
i
tell
you
what
sort
of
men
would
get
the
power
what
sort
of
men
would
end
by
returning
whom
they
pleased
to
parliament
felix
had
seen
every
face
around
him
and
had
particularly
noticed
a
recent
addition
to
his
audience
but
now
he
looked
about
him
without
appearing
to
fix
his
glance
on
any
one
in
spite
of
his
cooling
meditations
an
hour
ago
his
pulse
was
getting
quickened
by
indignation
and
the
desire
to
crush
what
he
hated
was
likely
to
vent
itself
in
articulation
his
tone
became
more
biting
they
would
be
men
who
would
undertake
to
do
the
business
for
a
candidate
and
return
him
men
who
have
no
real
opinions
but
who
pilfer
the
words
of
every
opinion
and
turn
them
into
a
cant
which
will
serve
their
purpose
at
the
moment
men
who
look
out
for
dirty
work
to
make
their
fortunes
by
because
dirty
work
wants
little
talent
and
no
conscience
men
who
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
bribery
because
there
is
not
a
cranny
in
their
own
souls
where
a
bribe
ca
enter
such
men
as
these
will
be
the
masters
wherever
there
a
majority
of
voters
who
care
more
for
money
for
drink
more
for
some
mean
little
end
which
is
their
own
and
nobody
else
than
for
anything
that
has
ever
been
called
right
in
the
world
for
suppose
there
a
poor
voter
named
jack
who
has
seven
children
and
twelve
or
fifteen
shillings
wages
perhaps
less
jack
ca
read
i
do
say
whose
fault
that
is
he
never
had
the
chance
to
learn
he
knows
so
little
that
he
perhaps
thinks
god
made
the
and
if
anybody
said
the
pattern
of
the
was
laid
down
in
the
testament
he
would
be
able
to
contradict
them
what
is
poor
jack
likely
to
do
when
he
sees
a
smart
stranger
coming
to
him
who
happens
to
be
just
one
of
these
men
that
i
say
will
be
the
masters
till
public
opinion
gets
too
hot
for
them
he
a
man
say
stout
with
coat
upon
coat
of
fine
broadcloth
open
enough
to
show
a
fine
gold
chain
none
of
your
dark
scowling
men
but
one
with
an
innocent
skin
and
very
smooth
light
hair
a
most
respectable
man
who
calls
himself
a
good
sound
english
name
as
green
or
baker
or
wilson
or
let
us
say
johnson
felix
was
interrupted
by
an
explosion
of
laughter
from
a
majority
of
the
bystanders
some
eyes
had
been
turned
on
johnson
who
stood
on
the
right
hand
of
felix
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
description
and
these
were
gradually
followed
by
others
till
at
last
every
hearer
attention
was
fixed
on
him
and
the
first
burst
of
laughter
from
the
two
or
three
who
knew
the
attorney
name
let
every
one
sufficiently
into
the
secret
to
make
the
amusement
common
johnson
who
had
kept
his
ground
till
his
name
was
mentioned
now
turned
away
looking
unusually
white
after
being
unusually
red
and
feeling
by
an
attorney
instinct
for
his
as
if
he
felt
it
was
a
case
for
taking
down
the
names
of
witnesses
all
the
hearers
turned
away
too
thinking
they
had
had
the
cream
of
the
speech
in
the
joke
against
johnson
which
as
a
thing
worth
telling
helped
to
recall
them
to
the
scene
of
dinner
who
is
this
johnson
said
christian
to
a
young
man
who
had
been
standing
near
him
and
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
laugh
curiosity
had
naturally
been
awakened
by
what
might
prove
a
golden
opportunity
oh
a
london
attorney
he
acts
for
transome
that
tremendous
fellow
at
the
corner
there
is
some
radical
demagogue
and
johnson
has
offended
him
i
suppose
else
he
would
have
turned
in
that
way
on
a
man
of
their
own
party
i
had
heard
there
was
a
johnson
who
was
an
understrapper
of
jermyn
said
christian
well
so
this
man
may
have
been
for
what
i
know
but
he
a
london
man
now
a
very
busy
fellow
on
his
own
legs
in
bedford
row
ha
ha
capital
though
when
these
liberals
get
a
slap
in
the
face
from
the
workingmen
they
so
very
fond
of
another
turn
along
the
street
enabled
christian
to
come
to
a
resolution
having
seen
jermyn
drive
away
an
hour
before
he
was
in
no
fear
he
walked
at
once
to
the
fox
and
hounds
and
asked
to
speak
to
johnson
a
brief
interview
in
which
christian
ascertained
that
he
had
before
him
the
johnson
mentioned
by
the
issued
in
the
appointment
of
a
longer
one
at
a
later
hour
and
before
they
left
duffield
they
had
come
not
exactly
to
a
mutual
understanding
but
to
an
exchange
of
information
mutually
welcome
christian
had
been
very
cautious
in
the
commencement
only
intimating
that
he
knew
something
important
which
some
chance
hints
had
induced
him
to
think
might
be
interesting
to
johnson
but
that
this
entirely
depended
on
how
far
he
had
a
common
interest
with
jermyn
johnson
replied
that
he
had
much
business
in
which
that
gentleman
was
not
concerned
but
that
to
a
certain
extent
they
had
a
common
interest
probably
then
christian
observed
the
affairs
of
the
transome
estate
were
part
of
the
business
in
which
jermyn
and
johnson
might
be
understood
to
represent
each
other
in
which
case
he
need
not
detain
johnson
at
this
hint
johnson
could
not
conceal
that
he
was
becoming
eager
he
had
no
idea
what
christian
information
was
but
there
were
many
grounds
on
which
johnson
desired
to
know
as
much
as
he
could
about
the
transome
affairs
independently
of
jermyn
by
little
and
little
an
understanding
was
arrived
at
christian
told
of
his
interview
with
tommy
trounsem
and
stated
that
if
johnson
could
show
him
whether
the
knowledge
could
have
any
legal
value
he
could
bring
evidence
that
a
legitimate
child
of
bycliffe
existed
he
felt
certain
of
his
fact
and
of
his
proof
johnson
explained
that
in
this
case
the
death
of
the
old
would
give
the
child
the
first
valid
claim
to
the
bycliffe
heirship
that
for
his
own
part
he
should
be
glad
to
further
a
true
claim
but
that
caution
would
have
to
be
observed
how
did
christian
know
that
jermyn
was
informed
on
this
subject
christian
more
and
more
convinced
that
johnson
would
be
glad
to
counteract
jermyn
at
length
became
explicit
about
esther
but
still
withheld
his
own
real
name
and
the
nature
of
his
relations
with
bycliffe
he
said
he
would
bring
the
rest
of
his
information
when
johnson
took
the
case
up
seriously
and
place
it
in
the
hands
of
bycliffe
old
lawyers
of
course
he
would
do
that
johnson
replied
that
he
would
certainly
do
that
but
that
there
were
legal
niceties
which
christian
was
probably
not
acquainted
with
that
esther
claim
had
not
yet
accrued
and
that
hurry
was
useless
the
two
men
parted
each
in
distrust
of
the
other
but
each
well
pleased
to
have
learned
something
johnson
was
not
at
all
sure
how
he
should
act
but
thought
it
likely
that
events
would
soon
guide
him
christian
was
beginning
to
meditate
a
way
of
securing
his
own
ends
without
depending
in
the
least
on
johnson
procedure
it
was
enough
for
him
that
he
was
now
assured
of
esther
legal
claim
on
the
transome
estates
chapter
xxxi
in
the
copia
of
the
factious
language
the
word
tory
was
entertained
and
being
a
vocal
word
readily
pronounced
it
kept
its
hold
and
took
possession
of
the
foul
mouths
of
the
the
loyalists
began
to
cheer
up
and
to
take
heart
of
grace
and
in
the
working
of
this
crisis
according
to
the
common
law
of
scolding
they
considered
which
way
to
make
payment
for
so
much
of
tory
as
they
had
been
treated
with
to
clear
immediately
the
train
took
and
ran
like
wildfire
and
became
general
and
so
the
account
of
tory
was
balanced
and
soon
began
to
run
up
a
sharp
score
on
the
other
side
at
last
the
great
epoch
of
the
election
for
north
loamshire
had
arrived
the
roads
approaching
treby
were
early
traversed
by
a
larger
number
of
vehicles
horsemen
and
also
than
were
ever
seen
at
the
annual
fair
treby
was
the
for
many
voters
whose
faces
were
quite
strange
in
the
town
and
if
there
were
some
strangers
who
did
not
come
to
poll
though
they
had
business
not
unconnected
with
the
election
they
were
not
liable
to
be
regarded
with
suspicion
or
especial
curiosity
it
was
understood
that
no
division
of
a
county
had
ever
been
more
thoroughly
canvassed
and
that
there
would
be
a
hard
run
between
garstin
and
transome
johnson
headquarters
were
at
duffield
but
it
was
a
maxim
which
he
repeated
after
the
great
putty
that
a
capable
agent
makes
himself
omnipresent
and
quite
apart
from
the
express
between
him
and
jermyn

presence
in
the
universe
had
potent
effects
on
this
december
day
at
treby
magna
a
slight
drizzling
rain
which
was
observed
by
some
tories
who
looked
out
of
their
bedroom
windows
before
six
made
them
hope
that
after
all
the
day
might
pass
off
better
than
alarmists
had
expected
the
rain
was
felt
to
be
somehow
on
the
side
of
quiet
and
conservatism
but
soon
the
breaking
of
the
clouds
and
the
mild
gleams
of
a
december
sun
brought
back
previous
apprehensions
as
there
were
already
precedents
for
riot
at
a
reformed
election
and
as
the
trebian
district
had
had
its
confidence
in
the
natural
course
of
things
somewhat
shaken
by
a
landed
proprietor
with
an
old
name
offering
himself
as
a
radical
candidate
the
election
had
been
looked
forward
to
by
many
with
a
vague
sense
that
it
would
be
an
occasion
something
like
a
fighting
match
when
bad
characters
would
probably
assemble
and
there
might
be
struggles
and
alarms
for
respectable
men
which
would
make
it
expedient
for
them
to
take
a
little
neat
brandy
as
a
precaution
beforehand
and
a
restorative
afterward
the
tenants
on
the
transome
estate
were
comparatively
fearless
poor
goffe
of
rabbit
end
considered
that
one
thing
was
as
mauling
as
the
other
and
that
an
election
was
no
worse
than
the
while
dibbs
taking
the
more
cheerful
view
of
a
prosperous
man
reflected
that
if
the
radicals
were
dangerous
it
was
safer
to
be
on
their
side
it
was
the
voters
for
debarry
and
garstin
who
considered
that
they
alone
had
the
right
to
regard
themselves
as
targets
for
men
and
crowder
if
he
could
have
got
his
ideas
countenanced
would
have
recommended
a
muster
of
with
defensive
pitchforks
on
the
side
of
church
and
king
but
the
bolder
men
were
rather
gratified
by
the
prospect
of
being
groaned
at
so
that
they
might
face
about
and
groan
in
return
crow
the
high
constable
of
treby
inwardly
rehearsed
a
brief
address
to
a
riotous
crowd
in
case
it
should
be
wanted
having
been
warned
by
the
rector
that
it
was
a
primary
duty
on
these
occasions
to
keep
a
watch
against
provocation
as
well
as
violence
the
rector
with
a
brother
magistrate
who
was
on
the
spot
had
thought
it
desirable
to
swear
in
some
special
constables
but
the
presence
of
loyal
men
not
absolutely
required
for
the
polling
was
not
looked
at
in
the
light
of
a
provocation
the
benefit
clubs
from
various
quarters
made
a
show
some
with
the
ribbons
and
streamers
of
the
true
tory
candidate
some
with
the
mazarine
of
the
whig
the
bands
played
auld
lang
syne
and
a
louder
mazarine
band
came
across
them
with
oh
whistle
and
i
will
come
to
thee
my
lad
probably
as
the
tune
the
most
symbolical
of
liberalism
which
their
repertory
would
furnish
there
was
not
a
single
club
bearing
the
radical
blue
the
sproxton
club
members
wore
the
mazarine
and
chubb
wore
so
much
of
it
that
he
looked
at
a
sufficient
distance
like
a
very
large
gentianella
it
was
generally
understood
that
these
brave
fellows
representing
the
fine
institution
of
benefit
clubs
holding
aloft
the
motto
let
brotherly
love
continue
were
a
civil
force
calculated
to
encourage
voters
of
sound
opinions
and
keep
up
their
spirits
but
a
considerable
number
of
unadorned
heavy
navvies
colliers
and
men
who
used
their
freedom
as
british
subjects
to
be
present
in
treby
on
this
great
occasion
looked
like
a
possible
uncivil
force
whose
politics
were
dubious
until
it
was
clearly
seen
for
whom
they
cheered
and
for
whom
they
groaned
thus
the
way
up
to
the
was
variously
lined
and
those
who
walked
it
to
whatever
side
they
belonged
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
from
the
opposite
side
what
were
the
most
marked
defects
or
excesses
in
their
personal
appearance
for
the
trebians
of
that
day
held
without
being
aware
that
they
had
cicero
authority
for
it
that
the
bodily
blemishes
of
an
opponent
were
a
legitimate
ground
for
ridicule
but
if
the
voter
frustrated
wit
by
being
handsome
he
was
groaned
at
and
satirized
according
to
a
formula
in
which
the
adjective
was
tory
whig
or
radical
as
the
case
might
be
and
the
substantive
a
blank
to
be
filled
up
after
the
taste
of
the
speaker
some
of
the
more
timid
had
chosen
to
go
through
this
ordeal
as
early
as
possible
in
the
morning
one
of
the
earliest
was
timothy
rose
the
from
leek
malton
he
had
left
home
with
some
foreboding
having
swathed
his
more
vital
parts
in
layers
of
flannel
and
put
on
two
greatcoats
as
a
soft
kind
of
armor
but
reflecting
with
some
trepidation
that
there
were
no
resources
for
protecting
his
head
he
once
more
wavered
in
his
intention
to
vote
he
once
more
observed
to
rose
that
these
were
hard
times
when
a
man
of
independent
property
was
expected
to
vote
but
finally
coerced
by
the
sense
that
he
should
be
looked
ill
on
in
these
times
if
he
did
not
stand
by
the
gentlemen
round
about
he
set
out
in
his
gig
taking
with
him
a
powerful
wagoner
whom
he
ordered
to
keep
him
in
sight
as
he
went
to
the
it
was
hardly
more
than
nine
when
rose
having
thus
come
up
to
the
level
of
his
times
cheered
himself
with
a
little
at
the
marquis
drove
away
in
a
much
more
courageous
spirit
and
got
down
at
nolan
just
outside
the
town
the
retired
londoner
he
considered
was
a
man
of
experience
who
would
estimate
properly
the
judicious
course
he
had
taken
and
could
make
it
known
to
others
nolan
was
superintending
the
removal
of
some
shrubs
in
his
garden
well
nolan
said
rose
twinkling
a
look
over
the
red
prominence
of
his
cheeks
have
you
been
to
give
your
vote
yet
no
all
in
good
time
i
shall
go
presently
well
i
would
lose
an
hour
i
would
i
said
to
myself
if
got
to
do
gentlemen
a
favor
i
do
it
at
once
you
see
i
got
no
landlord
nolan
i
in
that
position
o
life
that
i
can
be
independent
just
so
my
dear
sir
said
the
nolan
pinching
his
between
his
thumb
and
finger
and
giving
one
of
those
wonderful
universal
shrugs
by
which
he
seemed
to
be
recalling
all
his
garments
from
a
tendency
to
disperse
themselves
come
in
and
see
mrs
nolan
no
no
thankye
rose
expects
me
back
but
as
i
was
saying
i
a
independent
man
and
i
consider
it
not
my
part
to
show
favor
to
one
more
than
another
but
to
make
things
as
even
as
i
can
if
i
been
a
tenant
to
anybody
well
in
course
i
must
have
voted
for
my
landlord
that
stands
to
sense
but
i
wish
everybody
well
and
if
returned
to
parliament
more
than
another
nobody
can
say
it
my
doing
for
when
you
can
vote
for
two
you
can
make
things
even
so
i
gave
one
to
debarry
and
one
to
transome
and
i
wish
garstin
no
ill
but
i
help
the
odd
number
and
he
hangs
on
to
debarry
they
say
god
bless
me
sir
said
nolan
coughing
down
a
laugh
do
you
perceive
that
you
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
and
not
voted
at
all
unless
you
would
rather
send
a
radical
to
parliament
than
a
sober
whig
well
i
sorry
you
should
have
anything
to
say
against
what
i
done
nolan
said
rose
rather
crestfallen
though
sustained
by
inward
warmth
i
thought
you
agree
with
me
as
you
a
sensible
man
but
the
most
a
independent
man
can
do
is
to
try
and
please
all
and
if
he
has
the
luck
here
wishing
i
may
do
it
another
time
added
rose
apparently
confounding
a
toast
with
a
salutation
for
he
put
out
his
hand
for
a
passing
shake
and
then
stepped
into
his
gig
again
at
the
time
that
timothy
rose
left
the
town
the
crowd
in
king
street
and
in
the
where
the
stood
was
fluctuating
voters
as
yet
were
scanty
and
brave
fellows
who
had
come
from
any
distance
this
morning
or
who
had
sat
up
late
drinking
the
night
before
required
some
reinforcement
of
their
strength
and
spirits
every
public
house
in
treby
not
excepting
the
venerable
and
sombre
was
lively
with
changing
and
numerous
company
not
of
course
that
there
was
any
treating
treating
necessarily
had
stopped
from
moral
scruples
when
once
the
wits
were
out
but
there
was
drinking
which
did
equally
well
under
any
name
poor
tommy
trounsem
breakfasting
here
on
falstaff
proportion
of
bread
and
something
which
for
gentility
sake
i
will
call
sack
was
more
than
usually
victorious
over
the
ills
of
life
and
felt
himself
one
of
the
heroes
of
the
day
he
had
an
immense
cockade
in
his
hat
and
an
amount
of
silver
in
a
dirty
little
canvas
bag
which
astonished
himself
for
some
reason
at
first
inscrutable
to
him
he
had
been
paid
for
his
with
great
liberality
at
office
in
spite
of
his
having
been
the
victim
of
a
trick
by
which
he
had
once
lost
his
own
bills
and
pasted
up
debarry
but
he
soon
saw
that
this
was
simply
a
recognition
of
his
merit
as
an
old
family
kept
out
of
its
rights
and
also
of
his
peculiar
share
in
an
occasion
when
the
family
was
to
get
into
parliament
under
these
circumstances
it
was
due
from
him
that
he
should
show
himself
prominently
where
business
was
going
forward
and
give
additional
value
by
his
presence
to
every
vote
for
transome
with
this
view
he
got
a
bottle
filled
with
his
peculiar
kind
of
sack
and
hastened
back
to
the
feeling
and
patronizing
toward
all
political
parties
and
only
so
far
partial
as
his
family
bound
him
to
be
but
a
disposition
to
concentrate
at
that
extremity
of
king
street
which
issued
in
the
was
not
universal
among
the
increasing
crowd
some
of
them
seemed
attracted
toward
another
nucleus
at
the
other
extremity
of
king
street
near
the
seven
stars
this
was
garstin
chief
house
where
his
committee
sat
and
it
was
also
a
point
which
must
necessarily
be
passed
by
many
voters
entering
the
town
on
the
eastern
side
it
seemed
natural
that
the
mazarine
colors
should
be
visible
here
and
that
pack
the
tall
shepherd
of
the
sproxton
men
should
be
seen
moving
to
and
fro
where
there
would
be
a
frequent
opportunity
of
cheering
the
voters
for
a
gentleman
who
had
the
chief
share
in
the
sproxton
mines
but
the
side
lanes
and
entries
out
of
king
street
were
numerous
enough
to
relieve
any
pressure
if
there
was
need
to
make
way
the
lanes
had
a
distinguished
reputation
two
of
them
had
odors
of
brewing
one
had
a
side
entrance
to
tiliot
wine
and
spirit
vaults
up
another
muscat
cheeses
were
frequently
being
unloaded
and
even
some
of
the
entries
had
those
cheerful
suggestions
of
plentiful
provision
which
were
among
the
characteristics
of
treby
between
ten
and
eleven
the
voters
came
in
more
rapid
succession
and
the
whole
scene
became
spirited
cheers
sarcasms
and
oaths
which
seemed
to
have
a
flavor
of
wit
for
many
hearers
were
beginning
to
be
reinforced
by
more
practical
demonstrations
dubiously
jocose
there
was
a
disposition
in
the
crowd
to
close
and
hem
in
the
way
for
voters
either
going
or
coming
until
they
had
paid
some
kind
of
toll
it
was
difficult
to
see
who
set
the
example
in
the
transition
from
words
to
deeds
some
thought
it
was
due
to
jacob
cuff
a
tory
who
was
a
ornament
of
the
pothouse
and
gave
his
mind
much
leisure
for
amusing
devices
but
questions
of
origination
in
stirring
periods
are
notoriously
hard
to
settle
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
in
human
things
that
there
should
be
only
one
beginner
this
however
is
certain
that
chubb
who
wished
it
to
be
noticed
that
he
voted
for
garstin
solely
was
one
of
the
first
to
get
rather
more
notice
than
he
wished
and
that
he
had
his
hat
knocked
off
and
crushed
in
the
interest
of
debarry
by
tories
opposed
to
coalition
on
the
other
hand
some
said
it
was
at
the
same
time
that
mr
pink
the
saddler
being
stopped
on
his
way
and
made
to
declare
that
he
was
going
to
vote
for
debarry
got
himself
well
chalked
as
to
his
coat
and
pushed
up
an
entry
where
he
remained
the
prisoner
of
terror
combined
with
the
want
of
any
back
outlet
and
never
gave
his
vote
that
day
the
second
tory
joke
was
performed
with
much
gusto
the
majority
of
the
transome
tenants
came
in
a
body
from
the
ram
inn
with
banks
the
bailiff
leading
them
poor
goffe
was
the
last
of
them
and
his
worn
melancholy
look
and
gait
gave
the
jocose
cuff
the
notion
that
the
farmer
was
not
what
he
called
compus
goffe
was
cut
off
from
his
companions
and
hemmed
in
asked
by
voices
with
hot
breath
close
to
his
ear
how
many
horses
he
had
how
many
cows
how
many
fat
pigs
then
jostled
from
one
to
another
who
made
trumpets
with
their
hands
and
deafened
him
by
telling
him
to
vote
for
debarry
in
this
way
the
melancholy
goffe
was
hustled
on
till
he
was
at
the
filled
with
confused
alarms
the
immediate
alarm
being
that
of
having
to
go
back
in
still
worse
fashion
than
he
had
come
arriving
in
this
way
after
the
other
tenants
had
left
he
astonished
all
hearers
who
knew
him
for
a
tenant
of
the
transomes
by
saying
debarry
and
was
jostled
back
trembling
amid
shouts
of
laughter
by
stages
of
this
kind
the
fun
grew
faster
and
was
in
danger
of
getting
rather
serious
the
tories
began
to
feel
that
their
jokes
were
returned
by
others
of
a
heavier
sort
and
that
the
main
strength
of
the
crowd
was
not
on
the
side
of
sound
opinion
but
might
come
to
be
on
the
side
of
sound
cudgelling
and
kicking
the
navvies
and
pitmen
in
dishabille
seemed
to
be
multiplying
and
to
be
clearly
not
belonging
to
the
party
of
order
the
shops
were
freely
resorted
to
for
various
forms
of
playful
missiles
and
weapons
and
news
came
to
the
magistrates
watching
from
the
large
window
of
the
marquis
that
a
gentleman
coming
in
on
horseback
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
to
vote
for
garstin
had
had
his
horse
turned
round
and
frightened
into
a
headlong
gallop
out
of
it
again
crow
and
his
subordinates
and
all
the
special
constables
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
some
energetic
effort
or
else
every
voter
would
be
intimidated
and
the
poll
must
be
adjourned
the
rector
determined
to
get
on
horseback
and
go
amidst
the
crowd
with
the
constables
and
he
sent
a
message
to
lingon
who
was
at
the
ram
calling
on
him
to
do
the
same
sporting
jack
was
sure
the
good
fellows
meant
no
harm
but
he
was
courageous
enough
to
face
any
bodily
dangers
and
rode
out
in
his
brown
leggings
and
colored
bandana
speaking
persuasively
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
this
sally
was
made
the
constables
and
magistrates
tried
the
most
pacific
measures
and
they
seemed
to
succeed
there
was
a
rapid
thinning
of
the
crowd
the
most
boisterous
disappeared
or
seemed
to
do
so
by
becoming
quiet
missiles
ceased
to
fly
and
a
sufficient
way
was
cleared
for
voters
along
king
street
the
magistrates
returned
to
their
quarters
and
the
constables
took
convenient
posts
of
observation
wace
who
was
one
of
committee
had
suggested
to
the
rector
that
it
might
be
wise
to
send
for
the
military
from
duffield
with
orders
that
they
should
station
themselves
at
hathercote
three
miles
off
there
was
so
much
property
in
the
town
that
it
would
be
better
to
make
it
secure
against
risks
but
the
rector
felt
that
this
was
not
the
part
of
a
moderate
and
wise
magistrate
unless
the
signs
of
riot
recurred
he
was
a
brave
man
and
fond

felix
holt
seated
at
his
work
without
his
pupils
who
had
asked
for
a
holiday
with
a
notion
that
the
wooden
booths
promised
some
sort
of
show
noticed
about
eleven
that
the
noises
which
reached
him
from
the
main
street
were
getting
more
and
more
tumultuous
he
had
long
seen
bad
auguries
for
this
election
but
like
all
people
who
dread
the
prophetic
wisdom
that
ends
in
desiring
the
fulfillment
of
its
own
evil
forebodings
he
had
checked
himself
with
remembering
that
though
many
conditions
were
possible
which
might
bring
on
violence
there
were
just
as
many
which
might
avert
it
there
would
perhaps
be
no
other
mischief
than
what
he
was
already
certain
of
with
these
thoughts
he
sat
down
quietly
to
his
work
meaning
not
to
vex
his
soul
by
going
to
look
on
at
things
he
would
fain
have
made
different
if
he
could
but
he
was
of
a
fiber
that
vibrated
too
strongly
to
the
life
around
him
to
shut
himself
away
in
quiet
even
from
suffering
and
irremediable
wrong
as
the
noises
grew
louder
and
wrought
more
and
more
strongly
on
his
imagination
he
was
obliged
to
lay
down
his
delicate
his
mother
came
from
her
in
the
kitchen
where
little
job
was
her
companion
to
observe
that
they
must
be
killing
everybody
in
the
high
street
and
that
the
election
which
had
never
been
before
at
treby
must
have
come
for
a
judgment
that
there
were
mercies
where
you
did
look
for
them
and
that
she
thanked
god
in
his
wisdom
for
making
her
live
up
a
back
street
felix
snatched
his
cap
and
rushed
out
but
when
he
got
to
the
turning
into
the
the
magistrates
were
already
on
horseback
there
the
constables
were
moving
about
and
felix
observed
that
there
was
no
strong
spirit
of
resistance
to
them
he
stayed
long
enough
to
see
the
partial
dispersion
of
the
crowd
and
the
restoration
of
tolerable
quiet
and
then
went
back
to
holt
to
tell
her
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
now
he
was
going
out
again
and
she
must
not
be
in
any
anxiety
at
his
absence
she
might
set
by
his
dinner
for
him
felix
had
been
thinking
of
esther
and
her
probable
alarm
at
the
noises
that
must
have
reached
her
more
distinctly
than
they
had
reached
him
for
malthouse
yard
was
removed
but
a
little
way
from
the
main
street
lyon
was
away
from
home
having
been
called
to
preach
charity
sermons
and
attend
meetings
in
a
distant
town
and
esther
with
the
plaintive
lyddy
for
her
sole
companion
was
not
cheerfully
circumstanced
felix
had
not
been
to
see
her
yet
since
her
departure
but
he
gave
way
to
new
reasons
miss
esther
was
in
the
garret
lyddy
said
trying
to
see
what
was
going
on
but
before
she
was
fetched
she
came
running
down
the
stairs
drawn
by
the
knock
at
the
door
which
had
shaken
the
small
dwelling
i
am
so
thankful
to
see
you
she
said
eagerly
pray
come
in
when
she
had
shut
the
parlor
door
behind
them
felix
said
i
suspected
that
you
might
have
been
made
anxious
by
the
noises
i
came
to
tell
you
that
things
are
quiet
now
though
indeed
you
can
hear
that
they
are
i
frightened
said
esther
the
shouting
and
roaring
of
rude
men
is
so
hideous
it
is
a
relief
to
me
that
my
father
is
not
at
home
that
he
is
out
of
the
reach
of
any
danger
he
might
have
fallen
into
if
he
had
been
here
but
i
gave
you
credit
for
being
in
the
midst
of
the
danger
she
added
smiling
with
a
determination
not
to
show
much
feeling
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
has
happened
they
sat
down
at
the
extremities
of
the
old
black
sofa
and
felix
said
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
shut
myself
up
and
tried
to
be
as
indifferent
to
the
election
as
if
i
been
one
of
the
fishes
in
the
lapp
till
the
noises
got
too
strong
for
me
but
i
only
saw
the
tail
end
of
the
disturbance
the
poor
noisy
simpletons
seemed
to
give
way
before
the
magistrates
and
the
constables
i
hope
nobody
has
been
much
hurt
the
fear
is
that
they
may
turn
out
again
their
giving
way
so
soon
may
not
be
altogether
a
good
sign
there
a
great
number
of
heavy
fellows
in
the
town
if
they
go
and
drink
more
the
last
end
may
be
worse
than
the
first
however
felix
broke
off
as
if
this
talk
was
futile
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
leaning
backward
looked
at
esther
who
was
looking
at
him
may
i
stay
here
a
little
while
he
said
after
a
moment
which
seemed
long
pray
do
said
esther
coloring
to
relieve
herself
she
took
some
work
and
bowed
her
head
over
her
stitching
it
was
in
reality
a
little
heaven
to
her
that
felix
was
there
but
she
saw
beyond
it
saw
that
he
would
be
gone
and
that
they
should
be
farther
on
their
way
not
toward
meeting
but
parting
his
will
was
impregnable
he
was
a
rock
and
she
was
no
more
to
him
than
the
white
clinging
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
that
you
see
things
just
as
i
do
he
said
abruptly
after
a
minute
silence
i
am
sure
you
see
them
much
more
wisely
than
i
do
said
esther
almost
bitterly
without
looking
up
there
are
some
people
one
must
wish
to
judge
truly
not
to
wish
it
would
be
mere
hardness
i
know
you
think
i
am
a
man
without
feeling
at
least
without
strong
affections
you
think
i
love
nothing
but
my
own
resolutions
suppose
i
reply
in
the
same
sort
of
strain
said
esther
with
a
little
toss
of
the
head
how
why
that
you
think
me
a
shallow
woman
incapable
of
believing
what
is
best
in
you
setting
down
everything
that
is
too
high
for
me
as
a
deficiency
do
parry
what
i
say
answer
me
there
was
an
expression
of
painful
beseeching
in
the
tone
with
which
felix
said
this
esther
let
her
work
fall
on
her
lap
and
looked
at
him
but
she
was
unable
to
speak
i
want
you
to
tell
me
once
that
you
know
it
would
be
easier
to
me
to
give
myself
up
to
loving
and
being
loved
as
other
men
do
when
they
can
than
to
this
in
speech
was
something
quite
new
in
felix
for
the
first
time
he
had
lost
his
and
turned
his
eyes
away
he
was
at
variance
with
himself
he
had
begun
what
he
felt
he
ought
not
to
finish
esther
like
a
woman
as
she
was
a
woman
waiting
for
love
never
able
to
ask
for
it
had
her
joy
in
these
signs
of
her
power
but
they
made
her
generous
not
chary
as
they
might
have
done
if
she
had
had
a
pettier
disposition
she
said
with
deep
yet
timid
earnestness
what
you
have
chosen
to
do
has
only
convinced
me
that
your
love
would
be
the
better
worth
having
all
the
finest
part
of
esther
nature
trembled
in
those
words
to
be
right
in
great
memorable
moments
is
perhaps
the
thing
we
need
most
desire
for
ourselves
felix
as
quick
as
lightning
turned
his
look
upon
her
again
and
leaning
forward
took
her
sweet
hand
and
held
it
to
his
lips
some
moments
before
he
let
it
fall
again
and
raised
his
head
we
shall
always
be
the
better
for
thinking
of
each
other
he
said
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
supporting
his
head
as
he
looked
at
her
with
calm
sadness
this
thing
can
never
come
to
me
twice
over
it
is
my
knighthood
that
was
always
a
business
of
great
cost
he
smiled
at
her
but
she
sat
biting
her
inner
lip
and
pressing
her
hands
together
she
desired
to
be
worthy
of
what
she
reverenced
in
felix
but
the
inevitable
renunciation
was
too
difficult
she
saw
herself
wandering
through
the
future
weak
and
forsaken
the
charming
sauciness
was
all
gone
from
her
face
but
the
memory
of
it
made
this
childlike
dependent
sorrow
all
the
more
touching
tell
me
what
you
would
felix
burst
out
leaning
nearer
to
her
but
the
next
instant
he
started
up
went
to
the
table
took
his
cap
in
his
hand
and
came
in
front
of
her
he
said
very
gently
not
daring
to
put
out
his
hand
but
esther
put
up
hers
instead
of
speaking
he
just
pressed
it
and
then
went
away
she
heard
the
doors
close
behind
him
and
felt
free
to
be
miserable
she
cried
bitterly
if
she
might
have
married
felix
holt
she
could
have
been
a
good
woman
she
felt
no
trust
that
she
could
ever
be
good
without
him
felix
reproached
himself
he
would
have
done
better
not
to
speak
in
that
way
but
the
prompting
to
which
he
had
chiefly
listened
had
been
the
desire
to
prove
to
esther
that
he
set
a
high
value
on
her
feelings
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
he
was
very
important
to
her
and
he
was
too
simple
and
sincere
a
man
to
ape
a
sort
of
humility
which
would
not
have
made
him
any
the
better
if
he
had
possessed
it
such
pretences
turn
our
lives
into
sorry
dramas
and
felix
wished
esther
to
know
that
her
love
was
dear
to
him
as
the
beloved
dead
are
dear
he
felt
that
they
must
not
marry
that
they
would
ruin
each
other
lives
but
he
had
longed
for
her
to
know
fully
that
his
will
to
be
always
apart
from
her
was
renunciation
not
an
easy
preference
in
this
he
was
thoroughly
generous
and
yet
now
some
subtle
mysterious
conjuncture
of
impressions
and
circumstances
had
made
him
speak
he
questioned
the
wisdom
of
what
he
had
done
express
confessions
give
definiteness
to
memories
that
might
more
easily
melt
away
without
and
felix
felt
for
esther
pain
as
the
strong
soldier
who
can
march
on
hungering
without
fear
that
he
shall
faint
feels
for
the
young
brother
the
conscript
whose
load
is
too
heavy
for
him
chapter
xxxiii
mischief
thou
art
felix
could
not
go
home
again
immediately
after
quitting
esther
he
got
out
of
the
town
skirted
it
a
little
while
looking
across
the
december
stillness
of
the
fields
and
then
it
by
the
main
road
into
the
thinking
that
after
all
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
look
at
the
busy
doings
of
men
than
to
listen
in
solitude
to
the
voices
within
him
and
he
wished
to
know
how
things
were
going
on
it
was
now
nearly
one
and
felix
perceived
that
the
street
was
filling
with
more
than
the
previous
crowd
by
the
time
he
got
in
front
of
the
booths
he
was
himself
so
surrounded
by
men
who
were
being
thrust
hither
and
thither
that
retreat
would
have
been
impossible
and
he
went
where
he
was
obliged
to
go
although
his
height
and
strength
were
above
the
average
even
in
a
crowd
where
there
were
so
many
workmen
used
to
the
pickaxe
almost
all
trebians
must
have
been
there
but
the
entries
and
back
streets
of
the
town
did
not
supply
the
mass
of
the
crowd
and
besides
the
rural
incomers
both
of
the
more
decent
and
the
rougher
sort
felix
as
he
was
pushed
along
thought
he
discerned
here
and
there
men
of
that
keener
aspect
which
is
only
common
in
manufacturing
towns
but
at
present
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
distinctly
mischievous
design
there
was
only
evidence
that
the
majority
of
the
crowd
were
excited
with
drink
and
that
their
action
could
hardly
be
calculated
on
more
than
those
of
the
oxen
and
pigs
congregated
amidst
hootings
and
pushings
the
confused
deafening
shouts
the
incidental
fighting
the
knocking
over
pulling
and
scuffling
seemed
to
increase
every
moment
such
of
the
constables
as
were
mixed
with
the
crowd
were
quite
helpless
and
if
an
official
staff
was
seen
above
the
heads
it
moved
about
fitfully
showing
as
little
sign
of
a
guiding
hand
as
the
summit
of
a
buoy
on
the
waves
doubtless
many
hurts
and
bruises
had
been
received
but
no
one
could
know
the
amount
of
injuries
that
were
widely
scattered
it
was
clear
that
no
more
voting
could
be
done
and
the
poll
had
been
adjourned
the
probabilities
of
serious
mischief
had
grown
strong
enough
to
prevail
over
the
rector
objection
to
getting
military
aid
within
reach
and
when
felix
the
town
a
galloping
messenger
had
already
been
dispatched
to
duffield
the
rector
wished
to
ride
out
again
and
read
the
riot
act
from
a
point
where
he
could
be
better
heard
than
from
the
window
of
the
marquis
but
crow
the
high
constable
who
had
returned
from
closer
observation
insisted
that
the
risk
would
be
too
great
new
special
constables
had
been
sworn
in
but
crow
said
prophetically
that
if
once
mischief
began
the
mob
was
past
caring
for
constables
but
the
rector
voice
was
ringing
and
penetrating
and
when
he
appeared
on
the
narrow
balcony
and
read
the
formula
commanding
all
men
to
go
to
their
homes
or
about
their
lawful
business
there
was
a
strong
transient
effect
every
one
within
hearing
listened
and
for
a
few
moments
after
the
final
words
god
save
the
king
the
comparative
silence
continued
then
the
people
began
to
move
the
buzz
rose
again
and
grew
and
grew
till
it
turned
to
shouts
and
roaring
as
before
the
movement
was
that
of
a
flood
hemmed
in
it
carried
nobody
away
whether
the
crowd
would
obey
the
order
to
disperse
themselves
within
an
hour
was
a
doubt
that
approached
nearer
to
a
negative
certainty
presently
crow
who
called
himself
a
tactician
took
a
step
which
went
far
to
fulfill
his
own
prophecy
he
had
arrived
with
the
magistrates
by
a
back
way
at
the
seven
stars
and
here
again
the
riot
act
was
read
from
a
window
with
much
the
same
result
as
before
the
rector
had
returned
by
the
same
way
to
the
marquis
as
the
headquarters
most
suited
for
administration
but
crow
remained
at
the
other
extremity
of
king
street
where
some
presence
was
certainly
needed
seeing
that
the
time
was
passing
and
all
effect
from
the
voice
of
law
had
disappeared
he
showed
himself
at
an
upper
window
and
addressed
the
crowd
telling
them
that
the
soldiers
had
been
sent
for
and
that
if
they
did
not
disperse
they
would
have
cavalry
upon
them
instead
of
constables
crow
like
some
other
high
constables
more
celebrated
in
history
enjoyed
a
bad
reputation
that
is
to
say
he
enjoyed
many
things
which
caused
his
reputation
to
be
bad
and
he
was
anything
but
popular
in
treby
it
is
probable
that
a
pleasant
message
would
have
lost
something
from
his
lips
and
what
he
actually
said
was
so
unpleasant
that
instead
of
persuading
the
crowd
it
appeared
to
enrage
them
some
one
snatching
a
raw
potato
from
a
sack
in
the
shop
behind
him
threw
it
at
the
constable
and
hit
him
on
the
mouth
straightway
raw
potatoes
and
turnips
were
flying
by
twenties
at
the
windows
of
the
seven
stars
and
the
panes
were
smashed
felix
who
was
up
the
street
heard
the
voices
turning
to
a
savage
roar
and
saw
a
rush
toward
the
hardware
shop
which
furnished
more
effective
weapons
and
missiles
than
turnips
and
potatoes
then
a
cry
ran
along
that
the
tories
had
sent
for
the
soldiers
and
if
those
among
the
mob
who
called
themselves
tories
as
willingly
as
anything
else
were
disposed
to
take
whatever
called
itself
the
tory
side
they
only
helped
the
main
result
of
reckless
disorder
but
there
were
proofs
that
the
predominant
will
of
the
crowd
was
against
debarry
men
and
in
favor
of
transome
several
shops
were
invaded
and
they
were
all
of
them
tory
shops
the
tradesmen
who
could
do
so
now
locked
their
doors
and
barricaded
their
windows
within
there
was
a
panic
among
the
householders
of
this
hitherto
peaceful
town
and
a
general
anxiety
for
the
military
to
arrive
the
rector
was
in
painful
anxiety
on
this
head
he
had
sent
out
two
messengers
as
secretly
as
he
could
toward
hathercote
to
order
the
soldiers
to
ride
straight
to
the
town
but
he
feared
that
these
messengers
had
been
somehow
intercepted
it
was
three
more
than
an
hour
had
elapsed
since
the
reading
of
the
riot
act
the
rector
of
treby
magna
wrote
an
indignant
message
and
sent
it
to
the
ram
to
lingon
the
rector
of
little
treby
saying
that
there
was
evidently
a
radical
animus
in
the
mob
and
that
transome
party
should
hold
themselves
peculiarly
responsible
where
was
jermyn
lingon
replied
that
he
was
going
himself
out
toward
duffield
to
see
after
the
soldiers
as
for
jermyn
he
was
not
that
attorney
sponsor
he
believed
that
jermyn
was
gone
away
somewhere
on
business
to
fetch
voters
a
serious
effort
was
now
being
made
by
all
the
civil
force
at
command
the
december
day
would
soon
be
passing
into
evening
and
all
disorder
would
be
aggravated
by
obscurity
the
horrors
of
fire
were
as
likely
to
happen
as
any
minor
evil
the
constables
as
many
of
them
as
could
do
so
armed
themselves
with
carbines
and
sabres
all
the
respectable
inhabitants
who
had
any
courage
prepared
themselves
to
struggle
for
order
and
many
felt
with
wace
and
tiliot
that
the
nearest
duty
was
to
defend
the
breweries
and
the
spirit
and
wine
vaults
where
the
property
was
of
a
sort
at
once
most
likely
to
be
threatened
and
most
dangerous
in
its
effects
the
rector
with
fine
determination
got
on
horseback
again
as
the
best
mode
of
leading
the
constables
who
could
only
act
efficiently
in
a
close
body
by
his
direction
the
column
of
armed
men
avoided
the
main
street
and
made
their
way
along
a
back
road
that
they
might
occupy
the
two
chief
lanes
leading
into
the
of
the
brewery
and
bear
down
on
the
crowd
from
these
openings
which
it
was
especially
desirable
to
guard
meanwhile
felix
holt
had
been
hotly
occupied
in
king
street
after
the
first
at
the
seven
stars
there
was
a
sufficient
reason
for
damaging
that
inn
to
the
utmost
the
destructive
spirit
tends
toward
completeness
and
any
object
once
maimed
or
otherwise
injured
is
as
readily
doomed
by
unreasoning
men
as
by
unreasoning
boys
also
the
seven
stars
sheltered
spratt
and
to
some
sproxton
men
in
front
of
that
inn
it
was
exasperating
that
spratt
should
be
safe
and
sound
on
a
day
when
blows
were
going
and
justice
might
be
rendered
and
again
there
was
the
general
desirableness
of
being
inside
a
public
house
felix
had
at
last
been
willingly
urged
on
to
this
spot
hitherto
swayed
by
the
crowd
he
had
been
able
to
do
nothing
but
defend
himself
and
keep
on
his
legs
but
he
foresaw
that
the
people
would
burst
into
the
inn
he
heard
cries
of
spratt
fetch
him
out
we
pitch
him
out
pummel
him
it
was
not
unlikely
that
lives
might
be
sacrificed
and
it
was
intolerable
to
felix
to
be
witnessing
the
blind
outrages
of
this
mad
crowd
and
yet
be
doing
nothing
to
counteract
them
even
some
vain
effort
would
satisfy
him
better
than
mere
gazing
within
the
walls
of
the
inn
he
might
save
some
one
he
went
in
with
a
miscellaneous
set
who
dispersed
themselves
with
different
objects
some
to
the
and
to
search
for
the
cellar
some
to
search
in
all
the
rooms
for
spratt
or
any
one
else
perhaps
as
a
temporary
scapegoat
for
spratt
guided
by
the
screams
of
women
felix
at
last
got
to
a
high
passage
where
the
landlady
and
some
of
her
servants
were
running
away
in
helpless
terror
from
two
or
three
men
who
had
been
emptying
a
spirit
decanter
in
the
bar
assuming
the
tone
of
a
he
cried
out
here
boys
here
better
fun
this
way
come
with
me
and
drew
the
men
back
with
him
along
the
passage
they
reached
the
lower
staircase
in
time
to
see
the
unhappy
spratt
being
dragged
coatless
and
screaming
down
the
steps
no
one
at
present
was
striking
or
kicking
him
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
being
reserved
for
punishment
on
some
wider
area
where
the
satisfaction
might
be
more
generally
shared
felix
followed
close
determined
if
he
could
to
rescue
both
assailers
and
assaulted
from
the
worst
consequences
his
mind
was
busy
with
possible
devices
down
the
stairs
out
along
the
stones
through
the
gateway
spratt
was
dragged
as
a
mere
heap
of
linen
and
cloth
rags
when
he
was
got
outside
the
gateway
there
was
an
immense
hooting
and
roaring
though
many
there
had
no
grudge
against
him
and
only
guessed
that
others
had
the
grudge
but
this
was
the
narrower
part
of
the
street
it
widened
as
it
went
onward
and
spratt
was
dragged
on
his
enemies
crying
we
make
a
ring
we
see
how
frightened
he
looks
kick
him
and
have
done
with
him
felix
heard
another
say
let
go
to
tiliot
vaults
there
more
gin
there
here
were
two
hideous
threats
in
dragging
spratt
onward
the
people
were
getting
very
near
to
the
lane
leading
up
to
tiliot
felix
kept
as
close
as
he
could
to
the
threatened
victim
he
had
thrown
away
his
own
stick
and
carried
a
bludgeon
which
had
escaped
from
the
hands
of
an
invader
at
the
seven
stars
his
head
was
bare
he
looked
to
undiscerning
eyes
like
a
leading
spirit
of
the
mob
in
this
condition
he
was
observed
by
several
persons
looking
anxiously
from
their
upper
windows
and
finally
observed
to
push
himself
by
violent
efforts
close
behind
the
dragged
man
meanwhile
the
foremost
among
the
constables
who
coming
by
the
back
way
had
now
reached
the
opening
of
tiliot
lane
discerned
that
the
crowd
had
a
victim
amongst
them
one
spirited
fellow
named
tucker
who
was
a
regular
constable
feeling
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
meditation
called
on
his
neighbor
to
follow
him
and
with
a
sabre
that
happened
to
be
his
weapon
got
away
for
himself
where
he
was
not
expected
by
dint
of
quick
resolution
at
this
moment
spratt
had
been
let
go
had
been
dropped
in
fact
almost
lifeless
with
terror
on
the
street
stones
and
the
men
round
him
had
retreated
for
a
little
space
as
if
to
amuse
themselves
with
looking
at
him
felix
had
taken
his
opportunity
and
seeing
the
first
step
toward
a
plan
he
was
bent
on
he
sprang
forward
close
to
the
cowering
spratt
as
he
did
this
tucker
had
cut
his
way
to
the
spot
and
imagining
felix
to
be
the
destined
executioner
of
spratt
for
any
discrimination
of
tucker
lay
in
his
muscles
rather
than
his
eyes
he
rushed
up
to
felix
meaning
to
collar
him
and
throw
him
down
but
felix
had
rapid
senses
and
quick
thoughts
he
discerned
the
situation
he
chose
between
two
evils
quick
as
lightning
he
frustrated
the
constable
fell
upon
him
and
tried
to
master
his
weapon
in
the
struggle
which
was
watched
without
interference
the
constable
fell
undermost
and
felix
got
his
weapon
he
started
up
with
the
bare
sabre
in
his
hand
the
crowd
round
him
cried
hurray
with
a
sense
that
he
was
on
their
side
against
the
constable
tucker
did
not
rise
immediately
but
felix
did
not
imagine
that
he
was
much
hurt
do
touch
him
said
felix
let
him
go
here
bring
spratt
and
follow
me
felix
was
perfectly
conscious
that
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
tangled
business
but
he
had
chiefly
before
his
imagination
the
horrors
that
might
come
if
the
mass
of
wild
chaotic
desires
and
impulses
around
him
were
not
diverted
from
any
further
attacks
on
places
where
they
would
get
in
the
midst
of
intoxicating
and
inflammable
materials
it
was
not
a
moment
in
which
a
spirit
like
his
could
calculate
the
effect
of
misunderstanding
as
to
himself
nature
never
makes
men
who
are
at
once
energetically
sympathetic
and
minutely
calculating
he
believed
he
had
the
power
and
was
resolved
to
try
to
carry
the
dangerous
mass
out
of
mischief
till
the
military
came
to
awe
them
which
he
supposed
from
crow
announcement
a
long
time
ago
must
be
a
near
event
he
was
followed
the
more
willingly
because
tiliot
lane
was
seen
by
the
hindmost
to
be
now
defended
by
constables
some
of
whom
had
firearms
and
where
there
is
no
strong
any
proposition
to
do
something
that
is
unspecified
stimulates
stupid
curiosity
to
many
of
the
sproxton
men
who
were
within
sight
of
him
felix
was
known
personally
and
vaguely
believed
to
be
a
man
who
meant
many
queer
things
not
at
all
of
an
everyday
kind
pressing
along
like
a
leader
with
the
sabre
in
his
hand
and
inviting
them
to
bring
on
spratt
there
seemed
a
better
reason
for
following
him
than
for
doing
anything
else
a
man
with
a
definite
will
and
an
energetic
personality
acts
as
a
sort
of
flag
to
draw
and
bind
together
the
foolish
units
of
a
mob
it
was
on
this
sort
of
influence
over
men
whose
mental
state
was
a
mere
medley
of
appetites
and
confused
impressions
that
felix
had
dared
to
count
he
hurried
them
along
with
words
of
invitation
telling
them
to
hold
up
spratt
and
not
drag
him
and
those
behind
followed
him
with
a
growing
belief
that
he
had
some
design
worth
knowing
while
those
in
front
were
urged
along
partly
by
the
same
notion
partly
by
the
sense
that
there
was
a
motive
in
those
behind
them
not
knowing
what
the
motive
was
it
was
that
mixture
of
pushing
forward
and
being
pushed
forward
which
is
a
brief
history
of
most
human
things
what
felix
really
intended
to
do
was
to
get
the
crowd
by
the
nearest
way
out
of
the
town
and
induce
them
to
skirt
it
on
the
north
side
with
him
keeping
up
in
them
the
idea
that
he
was
leading
them
to
execute
some
stratagem
by
which
they
would
surprise
something
worth
attacking
and
circumvent
the
constables
who
were
defending
the
lanes
in
the
meantime
he
trusted
that
the
soldiers
would
have
arrived
and
with
this
sort
of
mob
which
was
animated
by
no
real
political
passion
or
fury
against
social
distinctions
it
was
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
that
there
would
be
any
resistance
to
a
military
force
the
presence
of
fifty
soldiers
would
probably
be
enough
to
scatter
the
rioting
hundreds
how
numerous
the
mob
was
no
one
ever
knew
many
inhabitants
afterward
were
ready
to
swear
that
there
must
have
been
at
least
two
thousand
rioters
felix
knew
he
was
incurring
great
risks
but
his
blood
was
up
we
hardly
allow
enough
in
common
life
for
the
results
of
that
enkindled
passionate
enthusiasm
which
under
other
conditions
makes
deeds
he
was
making
for
a
point
where
the
street
branched
off
on
one
side
toward
a
speedy
opening
between
hedgerows
on
the
other
toward
the
shabby
wideness
of
pollard
end
at
this
forking
of
the
street
there
was
a
large
space
in
the
centre
of
which
there
was
a
small
stone
platform
mounting
by
three
steps
with
an
old
green
upon
it
felix
went
straight
to
this
platform
and
stepped
upon
it
crying
halt
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
men
behind
and
before
him
and
calling
to
those
who
held
spratt
to
bring
him
there
all
came
to
a
stand
with
faces
toward
the
and
perhaps
for
the
first
time
the
extremities
of
the
crowd
got
a
definite
idea
that
a
man
with
a
sabre
in
his
hand
was
taking
the
command
now
said
felix
when
spratt
had
been
brought
to
the
stone
platform
faint
and
trembling
has
anybody
got
cord
if
not
handkerchiefs
knotted
fast
give
them
to
me
he
drew
out
his
own
handkerchief
and
two
or
three
others
were
mustered
and
handed
to
him
he
ordered
them
to
be
knotted
together
while
curious
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
was
he
going
to
have
spratt
hanged
felix
kept
fast
hold
of
his
weapon
and
ordered
others
to
act
now
put
it
round
his
waist
wind
his
arms
in
draw
them
a
little
backward
so
and
tie
it
fast
on
the
other
side
of
the
post
when
that
was
done
felix
said
imperatively
leave
him
there
we
shall
come
back
to
him
let
us
make
haste
march
along
lads
up
park
street
and
down
hobb
lane
it
was
the
best
chance
he
could
think
of
for
saving
spratt
life
and
he
succeeded
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
helpless
man
tied
up
sufficed
for
the
moment
if
there
were
any
who
had
ferocity
enough
to
count
much
on
coming
back
to
him
nobody
imagination
represented
the
certainty
that
some
one
out
of
the
houses
at
hand
would
soon
come
and
untie
him
when
he
was
left
alone
and
the
rioters
pushed
up
park
street
a
noisy
stream
with
felix
still
in
the
midst
of
them
though
he
was
laboring
hard
to
get
his
way
to
the
front
he
wished
to
determine
the
course
of
the
crowd
along
a
called
hobb
lane
which
would
have
taken
them
to
the
other
the
duffield
end
of
the
town
he
urged
several
of
the
men
round
him
one
of
whom
was
no
less
a
person
than
the
big
dredge
our
old
sproxton
acquaintance
to
get
forward
and
be
sure
that
all
the
fellows
would
go
down
the
lane
else
they
would
spoil
sport
hitherto
felix
had
been
successful
and
he
had
gone
along
with
an
unbroken
impulse
but
soon
something
occurred
which
brought
with
a
terrible
shock
the
sense
that
his
plan
might
turn
out
to
be
as
mad
as
all
bold
projects
are
seen
to
be
when
they
have
failed
mingled
with
the
more
headlong
and
crowd
there
were
some
men
who
loved
the
irrationality
of
riots
for
something
else
than
its
own
sake
and
who
at
present
were
not
so
much
the
richer
as
they
desired
to
be
for
the
pains
they
had
taken
in
coming
to
the
treby
election
induced
by
certain
prognostics
gathered
at
duffield
on
the
that
there
might
be
the
conditions
favorable
to
that
confusion
which
was
always
a
it
was
known
to
some
of
these
sharp
men
that
park
street
led
out
toward
the
grand
house
of
treby
manor
which
was
as
good
nay
better
for
their
purpose
than
the
bank
while
felix
was
entertaining
his
ardent
purpose
these
other
sons
of
adam
were
entertaining
another
ardent
purpose
of
their
peculiar
sort
and
the
moment
had
come
when
they
were
to
have
their
triumph
from
the
front
ranks
backward
toward
felix
there
ran
a
new
summons
a
new
invitation
let
us
go
to
treby
manor
from
that
moment
felix
was
powerless
a
new
definite
suggestion
overrode
his
vaguer
influence
there
was
a
determined
rush
past
hobb
lane
and
not
down
it
felix
was
carried
along
too
he
did
not
know
whether
to
wish
the
contrary
once
on
the
road
out
of
town
with
openings
into
fields
and
with
the
wide
park
at
hand
it
would
have
been
easy
to
liberate
himself
from
the
crowd
at
first
it
seemed
to
him
the
better
part
to
do
this
and
to
get
back
to
the
town
as
fast
as
he
could
in
the
hope
of
finding
the
military
and
getting
a
detachment
to
come
and
save
the
manor
but
he
reflected
that
the
course
of
the
mob
had
been
sufficiently
seen
and
that
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
park
street
to
carry
the
information
faster
than
he
could
it
seemed
more
necessary
that
he
should
secure
the
presence
of
some
help
for
the
family
at
the
manor
by
going
there
himself
the
debarrys
were
not
of
the
class
of
people
he
was
wont
to
be
anxious
about
but
felix
holt
conscience
was
alive
to
the
accusation
that
any
danger
they
might
be
in
now
was
brought
on
by
a
deed
of
his
in
these
moments
of
bitter
vexation
and
disappointment
it
did
occur
to
him
that
very
unpleasant
consequences
might
be
hanging
over
him
of
a
kind
quite
different
from
inward
dissatisfaction
but
it
was
useless
now
to
think
of
averting
such
consequences
as
he
was
pressed
along
with
the
multitude
into
treby
park
his
very
movement
seemed
to
him
only
an
image
of
the
fatalities
in
which
the
multitudinous
small
wickednesses
of
small
selfish
ends
really
undirected
toward
any
larger
result
had
issued
in
mischief
that
might
yet
be
hideous
illustration
felix
wounded
in
the
riot
the
light
was
declining
already
the
candles
shone
through
many
windows
of
the
manor
already
the
foremost
part
of
the
crowd
had
burst
into
the
offices
and
adroit
men
were
busy
in
the
right
places
to
find
plate
after
setting
others
to
force
the
butler
into
unlocking
the
cellars
and
felix
had
only
just
been
able
to
force
his
way
on
to
the
front
terrace
with
the
hope
of
getting
to
the
rooms
where
he
would
find
the
ladies
of
the
household
and
comfort
them
with
the
assurance
that
rescue
must
soon
come
when
the
sound
of
horses
feet
convinced
him
that
the
rescue
was
nearer
than
he
had
expected
just
as
he
heard
the
horses
he
had
approached
the
large
window
of
a
room
where
a
brilliant
light
suspended
from
the
ceiling
showed
him
a
group
of
women
clinging
together
in
terror
others
of
the
crowd
were
pushing
their
way
up
the
and
at
various
points
hearing
the
horses
he
kept
his
post
in
front
of
the
window
and
motioning
with
his
sabre
cried
out
to
the
oncomers
keep
back
i
hear
the
soldiers
coming
some
scrambled
back
some
paused
automatically
the
louder
and
louder
sound
of
the
hoofs
changed
its
pace
and
distribution
halt
fire
bang
bang
bang
came
deafening
the
ears
of
the
men
on
the
terrace
before
they
had
time
or
nerve
to
move
there
was
a
rushing
sound
closer
to
them
again
fire
a
bullet
whizzed
and
passed
through
felix
shoulder
the
shoulder
of
the
arm
that
held
the
naked
weapon
which
shone
in
the
light
from
the
window
felix
fell
the
rioters
ran
confusedly
like
terrified
sheep
some
of
the
soldiers
turning
drove
them
along
with
the
flat
of
their
swords
the
greater
difficulty
was
to
clear
the
invaded
offices
the
rector
who
with
another
magistrate
and
several
other
gentlemen
on
horseback
had
accompanied
the
soldiers
now
jumped
on
to
the
terrace
and
hurried
to
the
ladies
of
the
family
presently
there
was
a
group
round
felix
who
had
fainted
and
reviving
had
fainted
again
he
had
had
little
food
during
the
day
and
had
been
overwrought
two
of
the
group
were
civilians
but
only
one
of
them
knew
felix
the
other
being
a
magistrate
not
resident
in
treby
the
one
who
knew
felix
was
john
johnson
whose
zeal
for
the
public
peace
had
brought
him
from
duffield
when
he
heard
that
the
soldiers
were
summoned
i
know
this
man
very
well
said
johnson
he
is
a
dangerous
character
quite
revolutionary
it
was
a
weary
night
and
the
next
day
felix
whose
wound
was
declared
trivial
was
lodged
in
loamford
jail
there
were
three
charges
against
him
that
he
had
assaulted
a
constable
that
he
had
committed
manslaughter
tucker
was
dead
from
spinal
concussion
and
that
he
had
led
a
riotous
onslaught
on
a
four
other
men
were
committed
one
of
them
for
possessing
himself
of
a
gold
cup
with
the
debarry
arms
on
it
the
three
others
one
of
whom
was
the
collier
dredge
for
riot
and
assault
that
morning
treby
town
was
no
longer
in
terror
but
it
was
in
much
sadness
other
men
more
innocent
than
the
hated
spratt
were
groaning
under
severe
bodily
injuries
and
poor
tucker
corpse
was
not
the
only
one
that
had
been
lifted
from
the
pavement
it
is
true
that
none
grieved
much
for
the
other
dead
man
unless
it
be
grief
to
say
poor
old
fellow
he
had
been
trampled
upon
doubtless
where
he
fell
drunkenly
near
the
entrance
of
the
seven
stars
this
second
corpse
was

xxxiv
the
fields
are
hoary
with
december
frost
i
too
am
hoary
with
the
chills
of
age
but
through
the
fields
and
through
the
untrodden
woods
is
rest
and
stillness
only
in
my
heart
the
pall
of
winter
shrouds
a
throbbing
life
a
week
after
that
treby
riot
harold
transome
was
at
transome
court
he
had
returned
from
a
hasty
visit
to
town
to
keep
his
christmas
at
this
delightful
country
home
not
in
the
best
christmas
spirits
he
had
lost
the
election
but
if
that
had
been
his
only
annoyance
he
had
good
humor
and
good
sense
enough
to
have
borne
it
as
well
as
most
men
and
to
have
paid
the
eight
or
nine
thousand
which
had
been
the
price
of
ascertaining
that
he
was
not
to
sit
in
the
next
parliament
without
useless
grumbling
but
the
disappointments
of
life
can
never
any
more
than
its
pleasures
be
estimated
singly
and
the
healthiest
and
most
agreeable
of
men
is
exposed
to
that
coincidence
of
various
vexations
each
heightening
the
effect
of
the
other
which
may
produce
in
him
something
corresponding
to
the
spontaneous
and
externally
unaccountable
moodiness
of
the
morbid
and
disagreeable
harold
might
not
have
grieved
much
at
a
small
riot
in
treby
even
if
it
had
caused
some
expenses
to
fall
on
the
county
but
the
turn
which
the
riot
had
actually
taken
was
a
bitter
morsel
for
rumination
on
more
grounds
than
one
however
the
disturbances
had
arisen
and
been
aggravated
and
probably
no
one
knew
the
whole
truth
on
these
points
the
conspicuous
gravest
incidents
had
all
tended
to
throw
the
blame
on
the
radical
party
that
is
to
say
on
transome
and
on
transome
agents
and
so
far
the
candidateship
and
its
results
had
done
harold
dishonor
in
the
county
precisely
the
opposite
effect
to
that
which
was
a
dear
object
of
his
ambition
more
than
this
conscience
was
active
enough
to
be
very
unpleasantly
affected
by
what
had
befallen
felix
holt
his
memory
always
good
was
particularly
vivid
in
its
retention
of
felix
holt
complaint
to
him
about
the
treating
of
the
sproxton
men
and
of
the
subsequent
irritating
scene
in
office
when
the
personage
with
the
inauspicious
name
of
johnson
had
expounded
to
him
the
impossibility
of
revising
an
electioneering
scheme
once
begun
and
of
turning
your
vehicle
back
when
it
had
already
begun
to
roll
downhill
remembering
felix
holt
words
of
indignant
warning
about
hiring
men
with
drink
in
them
to
make
a
noise
harold
could
not
resist
the
urgent
impression
that
the
offences
for
which
felix
was
committed
were
fatalities
not
brought
about
by
any
willing
of
his
with
the
noisy
rioters
but
arising
probably
from
some
rather
efforts
to
counteract
their
violence
and
this
urgent
impression
which
insisted
on
growing
into
a
conviction
became
in
one
of
its
phases
an
uneasy
sense
that
he
held
evidence
which
would
at
once
tend
to
exonerate
felix
and
to
place
himself
and
his
agents
in
anything
but
a
desirable
light
it
was
likely
that
some
one
else
could
give
equivalent
evidence
in
favor
of
felix
the
little
talkative
dissenting
preacher
for
example
but
anyhow
the
affair
with
the
sproxton
men
would
be
ripped
open
and
made
the
worst
of
by
the
opposite
parties
the
man
who
has
failed
in
the
use
of
some
indirectness
is
helped
very
little
by
the
fact
that
his
rivals
are
men
to
whom
that
indirectness
is
a
something
human
very
far
from
being
alien
there
remains
this
grand
distinction
that
he
has
failed
and
that
the
jet
of
light
is
thrown
entirely
on
his
misdoings
in
this
matter
harold
felt
himself
a
victim
could
he
hinder
the
tricks
of
his
agents
in
this
particular
case
he
had
tried
to
hinder
them
and
had
tried
in
vain
he
had
not
loved
the
two
agents
in
question
to
begin
with
and
now
at
this
later
stage
of
events
he
was
more
innocent
than
ever
of
bearing
them
anything
but
the
most
sincere
he
was
more
utterly
exasperated
with
them
than
he
would
probably
have
been
if
his
one
great
passion
had
been
for
public
virtue
jermyn
with
his
john
johnson
had
added
this
ugly
dirty
business
of
the
treby
election
to
all
the
list
of
offences
which
harold
was
resolved
to
visit
on
him
to
the
utmost
he
had
seen
some
handbills
carrying
the
insinuation
that
there
was
a
discreditable
indebtedness
to
jermyn
on
the
part
of
the
transomes
if
any
such
notions
existed
apart
from
electioneering
slander
there
was
all
the
more
reason
for
letting
the
world
see
jermyn
severely
punished
for
abusing
his
power
over
the
family
affairs
and
tampering
with
the
family
property
and
the
world
certainly
should
see
this
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
the
cool
confident
assuming
fellow
should
be
bled
to
the
last
drop
in
compensation
and
all
connection
with
him
be
finally
got
rid
of
now
that
the
election
was
done
with
harold
meant
to
devote
himself
to
private
affairs
till
everything
lay
in
complete
order
under
his
supervision
this
morning
he
was
seated
as
usual
in
his
private
room
which
had
now
been
handsomely
fitted
up
for
him
it
was
but
the
third
morning
after
the
first
christmas
he
had
spent
in
his
english
home
for
fifteen
years
and
the
home
looked
like
an
eminently
desirable
one
the
white
frost
was
now
lying
on
the
broad
lawn
on
the
leaves
of
the
evergreens
and
on
the
giant
trees
at
a
distance
logs
of
dry
oak
blazed
on
the
hearth
the
carpet
was
like
warm
moss
under
his
feet
he
had
breakfasted
just
according
to
his
taste
and
he
had
the
interesting
occupations
of
a
large
proprietor
to
fill
the
morning
all
through
the
house
now
steps
were
noiseless
on
carpets
or
on
fine
matting
there
was
warmth
in
hall
and
corridors
there
were
servants
enough
to
do
everything
and
to
do
it
at
the
right
time
skilful
dominic
was
always
at
hand
to
meet
his
master
demands
and
his
bland
presence
diffused
itself
like
a
smile
over
the
household
infecting
the
gloomy
english
mind
with
the
belief
that
life
was
easy
and
making
his
real
predominance
seem
as
soft
and
light
as
a
down
quilt
old
transome
had
gathered
new
courage
and
strength
since
little
harry
and
dominic
had
come
and
since
harold
had
insisted
on
his
taking
drives
transome
herself
was
seen
on
a
fresh
background
with
a
gown
of
rich
new
stuff
and
if
in
spite
of
this
she
did
not
seem
happy
harold
either
did
not
observe
it
or
kindly
ignored
it
as
the
necessary
frailty
of
elderly
women
whose
lives
have
had
too
much
of
dullness
and
privation
our
minds
get
tricks
and
attitudes
as
our
bodies
do
thought
harold
and
age
stiffens
them
into
unalterableness
poor
mother
i
confess
i
should
not
like
to
be
an
elderly
woman
myself
one
requires
a
good
deal
of
the
purring
cat
for
that
or
else
of
the
loving
i
wish
she
would
take
more
to
little
harry
i
suppose
she
has
her
suspicions
about
the
lad
mother
and
is
as
rigid
in
those
matters
as
in
her
toryism
however
i
do
what
i
can
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
what
there
is
wanting
to
her
in
the
way
of
indulgence
and
luxury
to
make
up
for
the
old
niggardly
life
and
certainly
transome
court
was
now
such
a
home
as
many
women
would
covet
yet
even
harold
own
satisfaction
in
the
midst
of
its
elegant
comfort
needed
at
present
to
be
sustained
by
the
expectation
of
gratified
resentment
he
was
obviously
less
bright
and
enjoying
than
usual
and
his
mother
who
watched
him
closely
without
daring
to
ask
questions
had
gathered
hints
and
drawn
inferences
enough
to
make
her
feel
sure
that
there
was
some
storm
gathering
between
him
and
jermyn
she
did
not
dare
to
ask
questions
and
yet
she
had
not
resisted
the
temptation
to
say
something
bitter
about
harold
failure
to
get
returned
as
a
radical
helping
with
feminine
to
exclude
herself
more
completely
from
any
consultation
by
him
in
this
way
poor
women
whose
power
lies
solely
in
their
influence
make
themselves
like
music
out
of
tune
and
only
move
men
to
run
away
this
morning
harold
had
ordered
his
letters
to
be
brought
to
him
at
the
which
was
not
his
usual
practice
his
mother
could
see
that
there
were
london
business
letters
about
which
he
was
eager
and
she
had
found
out
that
the
letter
brought
by
a
clerk
the
day
before
was
to
make
an
appointment
with
harold
for
jermyn
to
come
to
transome
court
at
eleven
this
morning
she
observed
harold
swallow
his
coffee
and
push
away
his
plate
with
an
early
abstraction
from
the
business
of
breakfast
which
was
not
at
all
after
his
usual
manner
she
herself
ate
nothing
her
sips
of
tea
seemed
to
excite
her
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
hands
were
cold
she
was
still
young
and
ardent
in
her
terrors
the
passions
of
the
past
were
living
in
her
dread
when
harold
left
the
table
she
went
into
the
long
where
she
might
relieve
her
restlessness
by
walking
up
and
down
and
catch
the
sound
of
jermyn
entrance
into
harold
room
which
was
close
by
here
she
moved
to
and
fro
amongst
the
satin
of
chairs
and
curtains
the
great
story
of
this
world
reduced
for
her
to
the
little
tale
of
her
own
existence
dull
obscurity
everywhere
except
where
the
keen
light
fell
on
the
narrow
track
of
her
own
lot
wide
only
for
a
woman
anguish
at
last
she
heard
the
expected
ring
and
footstep
and
the
opening
and
closing
door
unable
to
walk
about
any
longer
she
sank
into
a
large
cushioned
chair
helpless
and
prayerless
she
was
not
thinking
of
god
anger
or
mercy
but
of
her
son
she
was
thinking
of
what
might
be
brought
not
by
death
but
by
life

check
to
your
queen
nay
your
own
king
is
bare
and
moving
so
you
give
yourself
checkmate
when
jermyn
entered
the
room
harold
who
was
seated
at
his
library
table
examining
papers
with
his
back
toward
the
light
and
his
face
toward
the
door
moved
his
head
coldly
jermyn
said
an
ungracious
as
little
as
possible
like
a
salutation
to
one
who
might
regard
himself
as
a
patron
on
the
attorney
handsome
face
there
was
a
black
cloud
of
defiant
determination
slightly
startling
to
harold
who
had
expected
to
feel
that
the
overpowering
weight
of
temper
in
the
interview
was
on
his
own
side
nobody
was
ever
prepared
beforehand
for
this
expression
of
jermyn
face
which
seemed
as
strongly
contrasted
with
the
cold
impenetrableness
which
he
preserved
under
the
ordinary
annoyance
of
business
as
with
the
bland
radiance
of
his
lighter
moments
harold
himself
did
not
look
amiable
just
then
but
his
anger
was
of
the
sort
that
seeks
a
vent
without
waiting
to
give
a
fatal
blow
it
was
that
of
a
nature
more
subtly
mixed
than
jermyn
less
animally
forcible
less
unwavering
in
selfishness
and
with
more
of
pride
he
looked
at
jermyn
with
increased
disgust
and
secret
wonder
sit
down
he
said
curtly
jermyn
seated
himself
in
silence
opened
his
greatcoat
and
took
some
papers
from
a
side
pocket
i
have
written
to
makepeace
said
harold
to
tell
him
to
take
the
entire
management
of
the
election
expenses
so
you
will
transmit
your
accounts
to
him
very
well
i
am
come
this
morning
on
other
business
if
it
about
the
riot
and
the
prisoners
i
have
only
to
say
that
i
shall
enter
into
no
plans
if
i
am
called
on
i
shall
say
what
i
know
about
that
young
fellow
felix
holt
people
may
prove
what
they
can
about
johnson
damnable
tricks
or
yours
either
i
am
not
come
to
speak
about
the
riot
i
agree
with
you
in
thinking
that
quite
a
subordinate
subject
when
jermyn
had
the
black
cloud
over
his
face
he
never
hesitated
or
drawled
and
made
no
latin
quotations
be
so
good
then
as
to
open
your
business
at
once
said
harold
in
a
tone
of
imperious
indifference
that
is
precisely
what
i
wish
to
do
i
have
here
information
from
a
london
correspondent
that
you
are
about
to
file
a
bill
against
me
in
chancery
jermyn
as
he
spoke
laid
his
hand
on
the
papers
before
him
and
looked
straight
at
harold
in
that
case
the
question
for
you
is
how
far
your
conduct
as
the
family
solicitor
will
bear
investigation
but
it
is
a
question
which
you
will
consider
quite
apart
from
me
doubtless
but
prior
to
that
there
is
a
question
which
we
must
consider
together
the
tone
in
which
jermyn
said
this
gave
an
unpleasant
shock
to
sense
of
mastery
was
it
possible
that
he
should
have
the
weapon
wrenched
out
of
his
hand
i
shall
know
what
to
think
of
that
he
replied
as
haughtily
as
ever
when
you
have
stated
what
the
question
is
simply
whether
you
will
choose
to
retain
the
family
estates
or
lay
yourself
open
to
be
forthwith
legally
deprived
of
them
i
presume
you
refer
to
some
underhand
scheme
of
your
own
on
a
par
with
the
annuities
you
have
drained
us
by
in
the
name
of
johnson
said
harold
feeling
a
new
movement
of
anger
if
so
you
had
better
state
your
scheme
to
my
lawyers
dymock
and
halliwell
no
i
think
you
will
approve
of
my
stating
in
your
own
ear
first
of
all
that
it
depends
on
my
will
whether
you
remain
an
important
landed
proprietor
in
north
loamshire
or
whether
you
retire
from
the
country
with
the
remainder
of
the
fortune
you
have
acquired
in
trade
jermyn
paused
as
if
to
leave
time
for
this
morsel
to
be
tasted
what
do
you
mean
said
harold
sharply
not
any
scheme
of
mine
but
a
state
of
the
facts
resulting
from
the
settlement
of
the
estate
made
in
state
of
the
facts
which
renders
your
father
title
and
your
own
title
to
the
family
estates
utterly
worthless
as
soon
as
the
claimant
is
made
aware
of
his
right
and
you
intend
to
inform
him
that
depends
i
am
the
only
person
who
has
the
requisite
knowledge
it
rests
with
you
to
decide
whether
i
shall
use
that
knowledge
against
you
or
whether
i
shall
use
it
in
your
favor
by
putting
an
end
to
the
evidence
that
would
serve
to
oust
you
in
spite
of
your
title
of
occupancy
jermyn
paused
again
he
had
been
speaking
slowly
but
without
the
least
hesitation
and
with
a
bitter
definiteness
of
enunciation
there
was
a
moment
or
two
before
harold
answered
and
then
he
said
abruptly
i
do
believe
you
i
thought
you
were
more
shrewd
said
jermyn
with
a
touch
of
scorn
i
thought
you
understood
that
i
had
had
too
much
experience
to
waste
my
time
in
telling
fables
to
persuade
a
man
who
has
put
himself
into
the
attitude
of
my
deadly
enemy
well
then
say
at
once
what
your
proofs
are
said
harold
shaking
in
spite
of
himself
and
getting
nervous
i
have
no
inclination
to
be
lengthy
it
is
not
more
than
a
few
weeks
since
i
ascertained
that
there
is
in
existence
an
heir
of
the
bycliffes
the
old
adversaries
of
your
family
more
curiously
it
is
only
a
few
days
ago
in
fact
only
since
the
day
of
the
riot
that
the
bycliffe
claim
has
become
valid
and
that
the
right
of
remainder
accrues
to
the
heir
in
question
and
how
pray
said
harold
rising
from
his
chair
and
making
a
turn
in
the
room
with
his
hands
thrust
in
his
pockets
jermyn
rose
too
and
stood
near
the
hearth
facing
harold
as
he
moved
to
and
fro
by
the
death
of
an
old
fellow
who
got
drunk
and
was
trampled
to
death
in
the
riot
he
was
the
last
of
that
thomas
transome
line
by
the
purchase
of
whose
interest
your
family
got
its
title
to
the
estate
your
title
died
with
him
it
was
supposed
that
the
line
had
become
extinct
before
and
on
that
supposition
the
old
bycliffes
founded
their
claim
but
i
hunted
up
this
man
just
about
the
time
the
last
suit
was
closed
his
death
would
have
been
of
no
consequence
to
you
if
there
had
not
been
a
bycliffe
in
existence
but
i
happen
to
know
that
there
is
and
that
the
fact
can
be
legally
proved
for
a
minute
or
two
harold
did
not
speak
but
continued
to
pace
the
room
while
jermyn
kept
his
position
holding
his
hands
behind
him
at
last
harold
said
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
speaking
in
a
scornful
tone
that
sounds
alarming
but
it
is
not
to
be
proved
simply
by
your
statement
clearly
i
have
here
a
document
with
a
copy
which
will
back
my
statement
it
is
the
opinion
given
on
the
case
more
than
twenty
years
ago
and
it
bears
the
signature
of
the
and
the
first
conveyancer
of
the
day
jermyn
took
up
the
papers
he
had
laid
on
the
table
opening
them
slowly
and
coolly
as
he
went
on
speaking
and
as
harold
advanced
toward
him
you
may
suppose
that
we
spared
no
pains
to
ascertain
the
state
of
the
title
in
the
last
suit
against
maurice
christian
bycliffe
which
threatened
to
be
a
hard
run
this
document
is
the
result
of
a
consultation
it
gives
an
opinion
which
must
be
taken
as
a
final
authority
you
may
cast
your
eyes
over
that
if
you
please
i
will
wait
your
time
or
you
may
read
the
here
jermyn
ended
holding
out
one
of
the
papers
to
harold
and
pointing
to
a
final
passage
harold
took
the
paper
with
a
slight
gesture
of
impatience
he
did
not
choose
to
obey
jermyn
indication
and
confine
himself
to
the
he
ran
through
the
document
but
in
truth
he
was
too
much
excited
really
to
follow
the
details
and
was
rather
acting
than
reading
till
at
once
he
threw
himself
into
his
chair
and
consented
to
bend
his
attention
on
the
passage
to
which
jermyn
had
pointed
the
attorney
watched
him
as
he
read
and
twice
to
sum
up
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
title
of
the
present
possessors
of
the
transome
estate
can
be
strictly
proved
to
rest
solely
upon
a
base
fee
created
under
the
original
settlement
of
and
to
be
good
so
long
only
as
issue
exists
of
the
tenant
in
tail
by
whom
that
base
fee
was
created
we
feel
satisfied
by
the
evidence
that
such
issue
exists
in
the
person
of
thomas
transome
otherwise
trounsem
of
littleshaw
but
upon
his
decease
without
issue
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
right
in
remainder
of
the
bycliffe
family
will
arise
which
right
would
not
be
barred
by
any
statute
of
limitation
when
harold
eyes
were
on
the
signatures
to
this
document
for
the
third
time
jermyn
said
as
it
turned
out
the
case
being
closed
by
the
death
of
the
claimant
we
had
no
occasion
for
producing
thomas
transome
who
was
the
old
fellow
i
told
you
of
the
enquiries
about
him
set
him
agog
and
after
they
were
dropped
he
came
into
this
neighborhood
thinking
there
was
something
fine
in
store
for
him
here
if
you
like
to
take
it
is
a
memorandum
about
him
i
repeat
that
he
died
in
the
riot
the
proof
is
ready
and
i
repeat
that
to
my
knowledge
and
mine
only
there
is
a
bycliffe
in
existence
and
that
i
know
how
the
proof
can
be
made
out
harold
rose
from
his
chair
again
and
again
paced
the
room
he
was
not
prepared
with
any
defiance
and
where
is
he
this
bycliffe
he
said
at
last
stopping
in
his
walk
and
facing
round
toward
jermyn
i
decline
to
say
more
till
you
promise
to
suspend
proceedings
against
me
harold
turned
again
and
looked
out
of
the
window
without
speaking
for
a
moment
or
two
it
was
impossible
that
there
should
not
be
a
conflict
within
him
and
at
present
it
was
a
very
confused
one
at
last
he
said
this
person
is
in
ignorance
of
his
claim
yes
has
been
brought
up
in
an
inferior
station
yes
said
jermyn
keen
enough
to
guess
part
of
what
was
going
on
in
harold
mind
there
is
no
harm
in
leaving
him
in
ignorance
the
question
is
a
purely
legal
one
and
as
i
said
before
the
complete
knowledge
of
the
case
as
one
of
evidence
lies
exclusively
with
me
i
can
nullify
the
evidence
or
i
can
make
it
tell
with
certainty
against
you
the
choice
lies
with
you
i
must
have
time
to
think
of
this
said
harold
conscious
of
a
terrible
pressure
i
can
give
you
no
time
unless
you
promise
me
to
suspend
proceedings
and
then
when
i
ask
you
you
will
lay
the
details
before
me
not
without
a
thorough
understanding
beforehand
if
i
engage
not
to
use
my
knowledge
against
you
you
must
engage
in
writing
that
on
being
satisfied
by
the
details
you
will
cancel
all
hostile
proceedings
against
me
and
will
not
institute
fresh
ones
on
the
strength
of
any
occurrences
now
past
well
i
must
have
time
said
harold
more
than
ever
inclined
to
thrash
the
attorney
but
feeling
bound
hand
and
foot
with
knots
that
he
was
not
sure
he
could
ever
unfasten
that
is
to
say
said
jermyn
with
his
persistence
you
will
write
to
suspend
proceedings
again
harold
paused
he
was
more
than
ever
exasperated
but
he
was
threatened
mortified
and
confounded
by
the
necessity
for
an
immediate
decision
between
alternatives
almost
equally
hateful
to
him
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
could
prevail
on
himself
to
speak
any
conclusive
words
he
walked
as
far
as
he
could
from
jermyn
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
then
walked
back
to
his
chair
and
threw
himself
into
it
at
last
he
said
without
looking
at
jermyn
i
agree
i
must
have
time
very
well
it
is
a
bargain
no
further
than
this
said
harold
hastily
flashing
a
look
at
jermyn
no
further
than
this
that
i
require
time
and
therefore
i
give
it
to
you
of
course
you
require
time
to
consider
whether
the
pleasure
of
trying
to
ruin
me
me
to
whom
you
are
really
indebted
is
worth
the
loss
of
the
transome
estates
i
shall
wish
you
harold
did
not
speak
to
him
or
look
at
him
again
and
jermyn
walked
out
of
the
room
as
he
appeared
outside
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
him
transome
showed
her
white
face
at
another
door
which
opened
on
a
level
with
harold
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
just
possible
for
jermyn
not
to
see
her
he
availed
himself
of
that
possibility
and
walked
straight
across
the
hall
where
there
was
no
servant
in
attendance
to
let
him
out
as
if
he
believed
that
no
one
was
looking
at
him
who
could
expect
recognition
he
did
not
want
to
speak
to
transome
at
present
he
had
nothing
to
ask
from
her
and
one
disagreeable
interview
had
been
enough
for
him
this
morning
she
was
convinced
that
he
had
avoided
her
and
she
was
too
proud
to
arrest
him
she
was
as
insignificant
now
in
his
eyes
as
in
her
son
men
have
no
memories
in
their
hearts
she
said
to
herself
bitterly
and
then
turning
into
her
she
heard
the
voices
of
transome
and
little
harry
at
play
together
she
would
have
given
a
great
deal
at
this
moment
if
her
feeble
husband
had
not
always
lived
in
dread
of
her
temper
and
her
tyranny
so
that
he
might
have
been
fond
of
her
now
she
felt
herself
loveless
if
she
was
important
to
any
one
it
was
only
to
her
old
denner
chapter
xxxvi
are
these
things
then
necessities
then
let
us
meet
them
like
necessities
shakespeare
see
now
the
virtue
living
in
a
word
hobson
will
think
of
swearing
it
was
noon
when
he
saw
dobson
at
the
fair
to
prove
poor
dobson
did
not
rob
the
mail
is
neighborly
to
save
a
neighbor
neck
what
harm
in
lying
when
you
mean
no
harm
but
say
is
perjury
then
hobson
quakes
he
none
of
perjury
thus
words
embalm
the
conscience
of
mankind
and
roman
laws
bring
still
a
conscience
to
poor
hobson
aid
few
men
would
have
felt
otherwise
than
harold
transome
felt
if
having
a
reversion
tantamount
to
possession
of
a
fine
estate
carrying
an
association
with
an
old
name
and
considerable
social
importance
they
were
suddenly
informed
that
there
was
a
person
who
had
a
legal
right
to
deprive
them
of
these
advantages
that
person
right
having
never
been
contemplated
by
any
one
as
more
than
a
chance
and
being
quite
unknown
to
himself
in
ordinary
cases
a
shorter
possession
than
harold
family
had
enjoyed
was
allowed
by
the
law
to
constitute
an
indefeasible
right
and
if
in
rare
and
peculiar
instances
the
law
left
the
possessor
of
a
long
inheritance
exposed
to
deprivation
as
the
consequence
of
old
obscure
transactions
the
moral
reasons
for
giving
legal
validity
to
the
title
of
long
occupancy
were
not
the
less
strong
nobody
would
have
said
that
harold
was
bound
to
hunt
out
this
alleged
and
urge
his
rights
upon
him
on
the
contrary
all
the
world
would
have
laughed
at
such
conduct
and
he
would
have
been
thought
an
interesting
patient
for
a
the
unconscious
was
probably
much
better
off
left
in
his
original
station
harold
would
not
have
been
called
upon
to
consider
his
existence
if
it
had
not
been
presented
to
him
in
the
shape
of
a
threat
from
one
who
had
power
to
execute
the
threat
in
fact
what
he
would
have
done
had
the
circumstances
been
different
was
much
clearer
than
what
he
should
choose
to
do
or
feel
himself
compelled
to
do
in
the
actual
crisis
he
would
not
have
been
disgraced
if
on
a
valid
claim
being
urged
he
had
got
his
lawyers
to
fight
it
out
for
him
on
the
chance
of
eluding
the
claim
by
some
adroit
technical
management
nobody
off
the
stage
could
be
sentimental
about
these
things
or
pretend
to
shed
tears
of
joy
because
an
estate
was
handed
over
from
a
gentleman
to
a
mendicant
sailor
with
a
wooden
leg
and
this
chance
was
perhaps
some
such
specimen
of
inheritance
as
the
drunken
fellow
killed
in
the
riot
all
the
world
would
think
the
actual
transomes
in
the
right
to
contest
any
adverse
claim
to
the
utmost
but
then
it
was
not
certain
that
they
would
win
in
the
contest
and
not
winning
they
would
incur
other
losses
besides
that
of
the
estate
there
had
been
a
little
too
much
of
such
loss
already
but
why
if
it
were
not
wrong
to
contest
the
claim
should
he
feel
the
most
uncomfortable
scruples
about
robbing
the
claim
of
its
sting
by
getting
rid
of
its
evidence
it
was
a
mortal
disappointment
it
was
a
sacrifice
of
indemnification
to
abstain
from
punishing
jermyn
but
even
if
he
brought
his
mind
to
contemplate
that
as
the
wiser
course
he
still
shrank
from
what
looked
like
complicity
with
jermyn
he
still
shrank
from
the
secret
nullification
of
a
just
legal
claim
if
he
had
only
known
the
details
if
he
had
known
who
this
alleged
heir
was
he
might
have
seen
his
way
to
some
course
that
would
not
have
grated
on
his
sense
of
honor
and
dignity
but
jermyn
had
been
too
acute
to
let
harold
know
this
he
had
even
carefully
kept
to
the
masculine
pronoun
and
he
believed
that
there
was
no
one
besides
himself
who
would
or
could
make
harold
any
wiser
he
went
home
persuaded
that
between
this
interview
and
the
next
which
they
would
have
together
harold
would
be
left
to
an
inward
debate
founded
entirely
on
the
information
he
himself
had
given
and
he
had
not
much
doubt
that
the
result
would
be
what
he
desired
harold
was
no
fool
there
were
many
good
things
he
liked
better
in
life
than
an
irrational
vindictiveness
and
it
did
happen
that
after
writing
to
london
in
fulfillment
of
his
pledge
harold
spent
many
hours
over
that
inward
debate
which
was
not
very
different
from
what
jermyn
imagined
he
took
it
everywhere
with
him
on
foot
and
on
horseback
and
it
was
his
companion
through
a
great
deal
of
the
night
his
nature
was
not
of
a
kind
given
to
internal
conflict
and
he
had
never
before
been
long
undecided
and
puzzled
this
unaccustomed
state
of
mind
was
so
painfully
irksome
to
him
he
rebelled
so
impatiently
against
the
oppression
of
circumstances
in
which
his
quick
temperament
and
habitual
decision
could
not
help
him
that
it
added
tenfold
to
his
hatred
of
jermyn
who
was
the
cause
of
it
and
thus
as
the
temptation
to
avoid
all
risk
of
losing
the
estate
grew
and
grew
till
scruples
looked
minute
by
the
side
of
it
the
difficulty
of
bringing
himself
to
make
a
compact
with
jermyn
seemed
more
and
more
insurmountable
but
we
have
seen
that
the
attorney
was
much
too
confident
in
his
calculations
and
while
harold
was
being
gulled
by
his
subjection
to
jermyn
knowledge
independent
information
was
on
its
way
to
him
the
messenger
was
christian
who
after
as
complete
a
survey
of
probabilities
as
he
was
capable
of
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
most
profitable
investment
he
could
make
of
his
peculiar
experience
and
testimony
in
relation
to
bycliffe
and
bycliffe
daughter
was
to
place
them
at
the
disposal
of
harold
transome
he
was
afraid
of
jermyn
he
utterly
distrusted
johnson
but
he
thought
he
was
secure
in
relying
on
harold
transome
care
for
his
own
interest
and
he
preferred
above
all
issues
the
prospect
of
forthwith
leaving
the
country
with
a
sum
that
at
least
for
a
good
while
would
put
him
at
his
ease
when
only
three
mornings
after
the
interview
with
jermyn
dominic
opened
the
door
of
harold
and
said
that
meester
chreestian
philip
debarry
courier
and
an
acquaintance
of
his
own
at
naples
requested
to
be
admitted
on
business
of
importance
immediate
thought
was
that
the
business
referred
to
the
political
affairs
which
were
just
now
his
chief
association
with
the
name
of
debarry
though
it
seemed
an
oddness
requiring
explanation
that
a
servant
should
be
personally
an
intermediary
he
assented
expecting
something
rather
disagreeable
than
otherwise
christian
wore
this
morning
those
perfect
manners
of
a
subordinate
who
is
not
servile
which
he
always
adopted
toward
his
unquestionable
superiors
debarry
who
preferred
having
some
one
about
him
with
as
little
resemblance
as
possible
to
a
regular
servant
had
a
singular
liking
for
the
adroit
christian
and
would
have
been
amazed
to
see
the
insolent
assumption
he
was
capable
of
in
the
presence
of
people
like
lyon
who
were
of
no
account
in
society
christian
had
that
sort
of
cleverness
which
is
said
to
know
the
world
that
is
to
say
he
knew
the
of
most
things
aware
that
he
was
looked
at
as
a
messenger
while
he
remained
standing
near
the
door
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
said
with
respectful
ease
you
will
probably
be
surprised
sir
at
my
coming
to
speak
to
you
on
my
own
account
and
in
fact
i
could
not
have
thought
of
doing
so
if
my
business
did
not
happen
to
be
something
of
more
importance
to
you
than
to
any
one
else
you
do
come
from
debarry
then
said
harold
with
some
surprise
no
sir
my
business
is
a
secret
and
if
you
please
must
remain
so
is
it
a
pledge
you
are
demanding
from
me
said
harold
rather
suspiciously
having
no
ground
for
confidence
in
a
man
of
position
yes
sir
i
am
obliged
to
ask
no
less
than
that
you
will
pledge
yourself
not
to
take
jermyn
into
confidence
concerning
what
passes
between
us
with
all
my
heart
said
harold
something
like
a
gleam
passing
over
his
face
his
circulation
had
become
more
rapid
but
what
have
you
had
to
do
with
jermyn
he
has
not
mentioned
me
to
you
then
has
he
sir
no
certainly
not
never
christian
thought
aha
jermyn
you
are
keeping
the
secret
well
are
you
he
said
aloud
then
jermyn
has
never
mentioned
to
you
sir
what
i
believe
he
is
aware
of
that
there
is
danger
of
a
new
suit
being
raised
against
you
on
the
part
of
a
bycliffe
to
get
the
estate
ah
said
harold
starting
up
and
placing
himself
with
his
back
against
the
mantelpiece
he
was
electrified
by
surprise
at
the
quarter
from
which
this
information
was
coming
any
fresh
alarm
was
counteracted
by
the
flashing
thought
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
act
independently
of
jermyn
and
in
the
rush
of
feelings
he
could
utter
no
more
than
an
interjection
christian
concluded
that
harold
had
no
previous
hint
it
is
this
fact
that
i
came
to
tell
you
of
from
some
other
motive
than
kindness
to
me
i
presume
said
harold
with
a
slight
approach
to
a
smile
certainly
said
christian
as
quietly
as
if
he
had
been
stating
yesterday
weather
i
should
not
have
the
folly
to
use
any
affectation
with
you
transome
i
lost
considerable
property
early
in
life
and
am
now
in
the
receipt
of
a
salary
simply
in
the
affair
i
have
just
mentioned
to
you
i
can
give
evidence
which
will
turn
the
scale
against
you
i
have
no
wish
to
do
so
if
you
will
make
it
worth
my
while
to
leave
the
country
harold
listened
as
if
he
had
been
a
legendary
hero
selected
for
peculiar
solicitation
by
the
evil
one
here
was
temptation
in
a
more
alluring
form
than
before
because
it
was
sweetened
by
the
prospect
of
eluding
jermyn
but
the
desire
to
gain
time
served
all
the
purposes
of
caution
and
resistance
and
his
indifference
to
the
speaker
in
this
case
helped
him
to
preserve
perfect
you
are
aware
he
said
coolly
that
silence
is
not
a
commodity
worth
purchasing
unless
it
is
loaded
there
are
many
persons
i
dare
say
who
would
like
me
to
pay
their
travelling
expenses
for
them
but
they
might
hardly
be
able
to
show
me
that
it
was
worth
my
while
you
wish
me
to
state
what
i
know
well
that
is
a
necessary
preliminary
to
any
further
conversation
i
think
you
will
see
transome
that
as
a
matter
of
justice
the
knowledge
i
can
give
is
worth
something
quite
apart
from
my
future
appearance
or
as
a
witness
i
must
take
care
of
my
own
interest
and
if
anything
should
hinder
you
from
choosing
to
satisfy
me
for
taking
an
essential
witness
out
of
the
way
i
must
at
least
be
paid
for
bringing
you
the
information
can
you
tell
me
who
and
where
this
bycliffe
is
i
can
give
me
a
notion
of
the
whole
affair
yes
i
have
talked
to
a
lawyer
not
jermyn
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
law
in
the
affair
you
must
not
count
on
any
wish
of
mine
to
suppress
evidence
or
remove
a
witness
but
name
your
price
for
the
information
in
that
case
i
must
be
paid
the
higher
for
my
information
say
two
thousand
pounds
two
thousand
devils
burst
out
harold
throwing
himself
into
his
chair
again
and
turning
his
shoulder
toward
christian
new
thoughts
crowded
upon
him
this
fellow
may
want
to
decamp
for
some
reason
or
other
he
said
to
himself
more
people
besides
jermyn
know
about
his
evidence
it
seems
the
whole
thing
may
look
black
for
me
if
it
comes
out
i
shall
be
believed
to
have
bribed
him
to
run
away
whether
or
not
thus
the
outside
conscience
came
in
aid
of
the
inner
i
will
not
give
you
one
sixpence
for
your
information
he
said
resolutely
until
time
has
made
it
clear
that
you
do
not
intend
to
decamp
but
will
be
forthcoming
when
you
are
called
for
on
those
terms
i
have
no
objection
to
give
you
a
note
specifying
that
after
the
fulfilment
of
that
condition
that
is
after
the
occurrence
of
a
suit
or
the
understanding
that
no
suit
is
to
occur
i
will
pay
you
a
certain
sum
in
consideration
of
the
information
you
now
give
me
christian
felt
himself
caught
in
a
vise
in
the
first
instance
he
had
counted
confidently
on
harold
ready
seizure
of
his
offer
to
disappear
and
after
some
words
had
seemed
to
cast
a
doubt
on
this
presupposition
he
had
inwardly
determined
to
go
away
whether
harold
wished
it
or
not
if
he
could
get
a
sufficient
sum
he
did
not
reply
immediately
and
harold
waited
in
silence
inwardly
anxious
to
know
what
christian
could
tell
but
with
a
vision
at
present
so
far
cleared
that
he
was
determined
not
to
risk
incurring
the
imputation
of
having
anything
to
do
with
scoundrelism
we
are
very
much
indebted
to
such
a
linking
of
events
as
makes
a
doubtful
action
look
wrong
christian
was
reflecting
that
if
he
stayed
and
faced
some
possible
inconveniences
of
being
known
publicly
as
henry
scaddon
for
the
sake
of
what
he
might
get
from
esther
it
would
at
least
be
wise
to
be
certain
of
some
money
from
harold
transome
since
he
turned
out
to
be
of
so
peculiar
a
disposition
as
to
insist
on
a
punctilious
honesty
to
his
own
disadvantage
did
he
think
of
making
a
bargain
with
the
other
side
if
so
he
might
be
content
to
wait
for
the
knowledge
till
it
came
in
some
other
way
christian
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
lest
he
should
get
nothing
by
this
clever
move
of
coming
to
transome
court
at
last
he
said
i
think
sir
two
thousand
would
not
be
an
unreasonable
sum
on
those
conditions
i
will
not
give
two
thousand
allow
me
to
say
sir
you
must
consider
that
there
is
no
one
whose
interest
it
is
to
tell
you
as
much
as
i
shall
even
if
they
could
since
jermyn
who
knows
it
has
not
thought
fit
to
tell
you
there
may
be
use
you
do
think
of
in
getting
the
information
at
once
well
i
think
a
gentleman
should
act
liberally
under
such
circumstances
so
i
will
i
could
not
take
less
than
a
thousand
pounds
it
really
would
not
be
worth
my
while
if
jermyn
knew
i
gave
you
the
information
he
would
endeavor
to
injure
me
i
will
give
you
a
thousand
said
harold
immediately
for
christian
had
unconsciously
touched
a
sure
spring
at
least
i
give
you
a
note
to
the
effect
i
spoke
of
he
wrote
as
he
had
promised
and
gave
the
paper
to
christian
now
do
be
circuitous
said
harold
you
seem
to
have
a
gift
of
speech
who
and
where
is
this
bycliffe
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
sir
that
she
is
supposed
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
old
preacher
lyon
in
malthouse
yard
good
god
how
can
that
be
said
harold
at
once
the
first
occasion
on
which
he
had
seen
esther
rose
in
his
memory
the
little
dark
parlor
the
graceful
girl
in
blue
with
the
surprisingly
distinguished
manners
and
appearance
in
this
way
old
lyon
by
some
strange
means
or
other
married
bycliffe
widow
when
this
girl
was
a
baby
and
the
preacher
did
want
the
girl
to
know
that
he
was
not
her
real
father
he
told
me
that
himself
but
she
is
the
image
of
bycliffe
whom
i
knew
well
an
uncommonly
fine
woman
steps
like
a
queen
i
have
seen
her
said
harold
more
than
ever
glad
to
have
purchased
this
knowledge
but
now
go
on
christian
proceeded
to
tell
all
he
knew
including
his
conversation
with
jermyn
except
so
far
as
it
had
an
unpleasant
relation
to
himself
then
said
harold
as
the
details
seemed
to
have
come
to
a
close
you
believe
that
miss
lyon
and
her
supposed
father
are
at
present
unaware
of
the
claims
that
might
be
urged
for
her
on
the
strength
of
her
birth
i
believe
so
but
i
need
not
tell
you
that
where
the
lawyers
are
on
the
scent
you
can
never
be
sure
of
anything
long
together
i
must
remind
you
sir
that
you
have
promised
to
protect
me
from
jermyn
by
keeping
my
confidence
never
fear
depend
upon
it
i
shall
betray
nothing
to
mr
jermyn
christian
was
dismissed
with
a
and
while
he
cultivated
some
friendly
reminiscences
with
dominic
harold
sat
chewing
the
cud
of
his
new
knowledge
and
finding
it
not
altogether
so
bitter
as
he
had
expected
from
the
first
after
his
interview
with
jermyn
the
recoil
of
mind
from
the
idea
of
strangling
a
legal
right
threw
him
on
the
alternative
of
attempting
a
compromise
some
middle
course
might
be
possible
which
would
be
a
less
evil
than
a
costly
lawsuit
or
than
the
total
renunciation
of
the
estates
and
now
he
had
learned
that
the
new
claimant
was
a
woman
a
young
woman
brought
up
under
circumstances
that
would
make
the
fourth
of
the
transome
property
seem
to
her
an
immense
fortune
both
the
sex
and
the
social
condition
were
of
the
sort
that
lies
open
to
many
softening
influences
and
having
seen
esther
it
was
inevitable
that
amongst
the
various
issues
agreeable
and
disagreeable
depicted
by
harold
imagination
there
should
present
itself
a
possibility
that
would
unite
the
two
claims
his
own
which
he
felt
to
be
the
rational
and
esther
which
apparently
was
the
legal
claim
harold
as
he
had
constantly
said
to
his
mother
was
not
a
marrying
man
he
did
not
contemplate
bringing
a
wife
to
transome
court
for
many
years
to
come
if
at
all
having
little
harry
as
an
heir
he
preferred
freedom
western
women
were
not
to
his
taste
they
showed
a
transition
from
the
feebly
animal
to
the
thinking
being
which
was
simply
troublesome
harold
preferred
a
woman
silent
and
affectionate
with
a
load
of
black
hair
weighing
much
more
heavily
than
her
brains
he
had
seen
no
such
woman
in
england
except
one
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
east
therefore
harold
did
not
care
to
be
married
until
or
unless
some
surprising
chance
presented
itself
and
now
that
such
a
chance
had
occurred
to
suggest
marriage
to
him
he
would
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
contemplated
marrying
esther
as
a
plan
he
was
only
obliged
to
see
that
such
an
issue
was
not
inconceivable
he
was
not
going
to
take
any
step
expressly
directed
toward
that
end
what
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
as
the
course
most
satisfactory
to
his
nature
under
present
urgencies
was
to
behave
to
esther
with
a
frank
gentle
manliness
which
must
win
her
good
will
and
incline
her
to
save
his
family
interest
as
much
as
possible
he
was
helped
to
this
determination
by
the
pleasure
of
frustrating
jermyn
contrivance
to
shield
himself
from
punishment
and
his
most
distinct
and
cheering
prospect
was
that
within
a
very
short
space
of
time
he
should
not
only
have
effected
a
satisfactory
compromise
with
esther
but
should
have
made
jermyn
aware
by
a
very
disagreeable
form
of
announcement
that
harold
transome
was
no
longer
afraid
of
him
jermyn
should
bite
the
dust
at
the
end
of
these
meditations
he
felt
satisfied
with
himself
and
he
had
rejected
two
dishonest
propositions
and
he
was
going
to
do
something
that
seemed
eminently
graceful
but
he
needed
his
mother
assistance
and
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
both
confide
in
her
and
persuade
her
within
two
hours
after
christian
left
him
harold
begged
his
mother
to
come
into
his
private
room
and
there
he
told
her
the
strange
and
startling
story
omitting
however
any
particulars
which
would
involve
the
identification
of
christian
as
his
informant
harold
felt
that
his
engagement
demanded
his
reticence
and
he
told
his
mother
that
he
was
bound
to
conceal
the
source
of
that
knowledge
which
he
had
got
independently
of
jermyn
transome
said
little
in
the
course
of
the
story
she
made
no
exclamations
but
she
listened
with
close
attention
and
asked
a
few
questions
so
much
to
the
point
as
to
surprise
harold
when
he
showed
her
the
copy
of
the
legal
opinion
which
jermyn
had
left
with
him
she
said
she
knew
it
very
well
she
had
a
copy
herself
the
particulars
of
that
last
lawsuit
were
too
well
engraven
on
her
mind
it
happened
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
one
to
supersede
her
and
she
was
the
virtual
head
of
the
family
affairs
she
was
prepared
to
understand
how
the
estate
might
be
in
danger
but
nothing
had
prepared
her
for
the
strange
details
for
the
way
in
which
the
new
claimant
had
been
reared
and
brought
within
the
range
of
converging
motives
that
had
led
to
this
revelation
least
of
all
for
the
part
jermyn
had
come
to
play
in
the
revelation
transome
saw
these
things
through
the
medium
of
certain
dominant
emotions
that
made
them
seem
like
a
retribution
harold
perceived
that
she
was
painfully
agitated
that
she
trembled
and
that
her
white
lips
would
not
readily
lend
themselves
to
speech
and
this
was
hardly
more
than
he
expected
he
had
not
liked
the
revelation
himself
when
it
had
first
come
to
him
but
he
did
not
guess
what
it
was
in
his
narrative
which
had
most
pierced
his
mother
it
was
something
that
made
the
threat
about
the
estate
only
a
secondary
alarm
now
for
the
first
time
she
heard
of
the
intended
proceedings
against
jermyn
harold
had
not
chosen
to
speak
of
them
before
but
having
at
last
called
his
mother
into
consultation
there
was
nothing
in
his
mind
to
hinder
him
from
speaking
without
reserve
of
his
determination
to
visit
on
the
attorney
his
shameful
maladministration
of
the
family
affairs
harold
went
through
the
whole
narrative
of
what
he
called
scheme
to
catch
him
in
a
vise
and
his
power
of
triumphantly
frustrating
that
scheme
in
his
usual
rapid
way
speaking
with
a
final
decisiveness
of
tone
and
his
mother
felt
that
if
she
urged
any
at
all
she
could
only
do
so
when
he
had
no
more
to
say
now
what
i
want
you
to
do
mother
if
you
can
see
this
matter
as
i
see
it
harold
said
in
conclusion
is
to
go
with
me
to
call
on
this
girl
in
malthouse
yard
i
will
open
the
affair
to
her
it
appears
she
is
not
likely
to
have
been
informed
yet
and
you
will
invite
her
to
visit
you
here
at
once
that
all
scandal
all
hatching
of
may
be
avoided
and
the
thing
may
be
brought
to
an
amicable
conclusion
it
seems
almost
incredible
extraordinary
a
girl
in
her
position
said
transome
with
difficulty
it
would
have
seemed
the
bitterest
humiliating
penance
if
another
sort
of
suffering
had
left
any
room
in
her
heart
i
assure
you
she
is
a
lady
i
saw
her
when
i
was
canvassing
and
was
amazed
at
the
time
you
will
be
quite
struck
with
her
it
is
no
indignity
for
you
to
invite
her
oh
said
transome
with
bitterness
i
must
put
up
with
all
things
as
they
are
determined
for
me
when
shall
we
go
well
said
harold
looking
at
his
watch
it
is
hardly
two
yet
we
could
really
go
when
you
have
lunched
it
is
better
to
lose
no
time
i
order
the
carriage
stay
said
transome
with
a
desperate
effort
there
is
plenty
of
time
i
shall
not
lunch
i
have
a
word
to
say
harold
withdrew
his
hand
from
the
bell
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
to
listen
you
see
i
comply
with
your
wish
at
once
harold
yes
mother
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
making
no
difficulties
you
ought
to
listen
to
me
in
return
pray
go
on
said
harold
expecting
to
be
annoyed
what
is
the
good
of
having
these
chancery
proceedings
against
jermyn
good
this
good
that
fellow
has
burdened
the
estate
with
annuities
and
mortgages
to
the
extent
of
three
thousand
a
year
and
the
bulk
of
them
i
am
certain
he
holds
himself
under
the
name
of
another
man
and
the
advances
this
yearly
interest
represents
have
not
been
much
more
than
twenty
thousand
of
course
he
has
hoodwinked
you
and
my
father
never
gave
attention
to
these
things
he
has
been
up
to
all
sorts
of
work
with
the
deeds
he
did
count
on
my
coming
back
from
smyrna
to
fill
poor
durfey
place
he
shall
feel
the
difference
and
the
good
will
be
that
i
shall
save
almost
all
the
annuities
for
the
rest
of
my
father
life
which
may
be
ten
years
or
more
and
i
shall
get
back
some
of
the
money
and
i
shall
punish
a
scoundrel
that
is
the
good
he
will
be
ruined
that
what
i
intend
said
harold
sharply
he
exerted
himself
a
great
deal
for
us
in
the
old
suits
everyone
said
he
had
wonderful
zeal
and
ability
said
transome
getting
courage
and
warmth
as
she
went
on
her
temper
was
rising
what
he
did
he
did
for
his
own
sake
you
may
depend
on
that
said
harold
with
a
scornful
laugh
there
were
very
painful
things
in
that
last
suit
you
seem
anxious
about
this
young
woman
to
avoid
all
further
scandal
and
contests
in
the
family
why
do
you
wish
to
do
it
in
this
case
jermyn
might
be
willing
to
arrange
things
amicably
to
make
restitution
as
far
as
he
can
if
he
has
done
anything
wrong
i
will
arrange
nothing
amicably
with
him
said
harold
decisively
if
he
has
ever
done
anything
scandalous
as
our
agent
let
him
bear
the
infamy
and
the
right
way
to
throw
the
infamy
on
him
is
to
show
the
world
that
he
has
robbed
us
and
that
i
mean
to
punish
him
why
do
you
wish
to
shield
such
a
fellow
mother
it
has
been
chiefly
through
him
that
you
have
had
to
lead
such
a
thrifty
miserable
life
you
who
used
to
make
as
brilliant
a
figure
as
a
woman
need
wish
transome
rising
temper
was
turned
into
a
horrible
sensation
as
painful
as
a
sudden
concussion
from
something
hard
and
immovable
when
we
have
struck
out
with
our
fist
intending
to
hit
something
warm
soft
and
breathing
like
ourselves
poor
transome
strokes
were
sent
jarring
back
on
her
by
a
hard
unalterable
past
she
did
not
speak
in
answer
to
harold
but
rose
from
the
chair
as
if
she
gave
up
the
debate
women
are
frightened
at
everything
i
know
said
harold
kindly
feeling
that
he
had
been
a
little
harsh
after
his
mother
compliance
and
you
have
been
used
for
so
many
years
to
think
jermyn
a
law
of
nature
come
mother
he
went
on
looking
at
her
gently
and
resting
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
look
cheerful
we
shall
get
through
all
these
difficulties
and
this
girl
i
dare
say
she
will
be
quite
an
interesting
visitor
for
you
you
have
not
had
any
young
girl
about
you
for
a
long
while
who
knows
she
may
fall
deeply
in
love
with
me
and
i
may
be
obliged
to
marry
her
he
spoke
laughingly
only
thinking
how
he
could
make
his
mother
smile
but
she
looked
at
him
seriously
and
said
do
you
mean
that
harold
am
i
not
capable
of
making
a
conquest
not
too
fat
yet
a
handsome
youth
of
she
was
forced
to
look
straight
at
the
beaming
face
with
its
rich
dark
color
just
bent
a
little
over
her
why
could
she
not
be
happy
in
this
son
whose
future
she
had
once
dreamed
of
and
who
had
been
as
fortunate
as
she
had
ever
hoped
the
tears
came
not
plenteously
but
making
her
dark
eyes
as
large
and
bright
as
youth
had
once
made
them
without
tears
there
there
said
harold
coaxingly
do
be
afraid
you
shall
not
have
a
unless
she
is
a
pearl
now
we
will
get
ready
to
go
in
half
an
hour
from
that
time
transome
came
down
looking
majestic
in
sables
and
velvet
ready
to
call
on
the
girl
in
malthouse
yard
she
had
composed
herself
to
go
through
this
task
she
saw
there
was
nothing
better
to
be
done
after
the
resolutions
harold
had
taken
some
sort
of
compromise
with
this
heiress
was
the
result
most
to
be
hoped
for
if
the
compromise
turned
out
to
be
a
marriage
well
she
had
no
reason
to
care
much
she
was
already
powerless
it
remained
to
be
seen
what
this
girl
was
the
carriage
was
to
be
driven
round
the
back
way
to
avoid
too
much
observation
but
the
late
election
affairs
might
account
for
receiving
a
visit
from
the
unsuccessful
radical
candidate
chapter
xxxvii
i
also
could
speak
as
ye
do
if
your
soul
were
in
my
soul
stead
i
could
heap
up
words
against
you
and
shake
mine
head
at
of
in
the
interval
since
esther
parted
with
felix
holt
on
the
day
of
the
riot
she
had
gone
through
so
much
emotion
and
had
already
had
so
strong
a
shock
of
surprise
that
she
was
prepared
to
receive
any
new
incident
of
an
unwonted
kind
with
comparative
equanimity
when
lyon
had
got
home
again
from
his
preaching
excursion
felix
was
already
on
his
way
to
loamford
jail
the
little
minister
was
terribly
shaken
by
the
news
he
saw
no
clear
explanation
of
felix
holt
conduct
for
the
statements
esther
had
heard
were
so
conflicting
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
gather
distinctly
what
had
come
out
in
the
examination
by
the
magistrates
but
lyon
felt
confident
that
felix
was
innocent
of
any
wish
to
abet
a
riot
or
the
infliction
of
injuries
what
he
chiefly
feared
was
that
in
the
fatal
encounter
with
tucker
he
had
been
moved
by
a
rash
temper
not
sufficiently
guarded
against
by
a
prayerful
and
humble
spirit
my
poor
young
friend
is
being
taught
with
mysterious
severity
the
evil
of
a
too
confident
he
said
to
esther
as
they
sat
opposite
to
each
other
listening
and
speaking
sadly
you
will
go
and
see
him
father
verily
will
i
but
i
must
straightway
go
and
see
that
poor
afflicted
woman
whose
soul
is
doubtless
whirled
about
in
this
trouble
like
a
shapeless
and
unstable
thing
driven
by
divided
winds
lyon
rose
and
took
his
hat
hastily
ready
to
walk
out
with
his
greatcoat
flying
open
and
exposing
his
small
person
to
the
keen
air
stay
father
pray
till
you
have
had
some
food
said
esther
putting
her
hand
on
his
arm
you
look
quite
weary
and
shattered
child
i
can
not
stay
i
can
neither
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
till
i
have
learned
more
about
this
young
man
deeds
what
can
be
proved
and
what
can
not
be
proved
against
him
i
fear
he
has
none
to
stand
by
him
in
this
town
for
even
by
the
friends
of
our
church
i
have
been
ofttimes
rebuked
because
he
seemed
dear
to
me
but
esther
my
beloved
child
here
lyon
grasped
her
arm
and
seemed
in
the
need
of
speech
to
forget
his
previous
haste
i
bear
in
mind
this
the
lord
knoweth
them
that
are
his
but
we
we
are
left
to
judge
by
uncertain
signs
that
so
we
may
learn
to
exercise
hope
and
faith
toward
one
another
and
in
this
uncertainty
i
cling
with
awful
hope
to
those
whom
the
world
loves
not
because
their
conscience
albeit
mistakenly
is
at
war
with
the
habits
of
the
world
our
great
faith
my
esther
is
the
faith
of
martyrs
i
will
not
lightly
turn
away
from
any
man
who
endures
harshness
because
he
will
not
lie
nay
though
i
would
not
wantonly
grasp
at
ease
of
mind
through
an
arbitrary
choice
of
doctrine
i
can
not
but
believe
that
the
merits
of
the
divine
sacrifice
are
wider
than
our
utmost
charity
i
once
believed
otherwise
but
not
now
not
now
the
minister
paused
and
seemed
to
be
abstractedly
gazing
at
some
memory
he
was
always
liable
to
be
snatched
away
by
thoughts
from
the
pursuit
of
a
purpose
which
had
seemed
pressing
esther
seized
the
opportunity
and
prevailed
on
him
to
fortify
himself
with
some
of
porridge
before
he
went
out
on
his
tiring
task
of
seeking
definite
trustworthy
knowledge
from
the
lips
of
various
witnesses
beginning
with
that
feminine
darkener
of
counsel
poor
holt
she
regarding
all
her
trouble
about
felix
in
the
light
of
a
fulfilment
of
her
own
prophecies
treated
the
sad
history
with
a
preference
for
edification
above
accuracy
and
for
mystery
above
relevance
worthy
of
a
commentator
on
the
apocalypse
she
insisted
chiefly
not
on
the
important
facts
that
felix
had
sat
at
his
work
till
after
eleven
like
a
deaf
man
had
rushed
out
in
surprise
and
alarm
had
come
back
to
report
with
satisfaction
that
things
were
quiet
and
had
asked
her
to
set
by
his
dinner
for
him
facts
which
would
tell
as
evidence
that
felix
was
disconnected
with
any
project
of
disturbances
and
was
averse
to
them
these
things
came
out
incidentally
in
her
long
plaint
to
the
minister
but
what
holt
felt
it
essential
to
state
was
that
long
before
michaelmas
was
turned
sitting
in
her
chair
she
had
said
to
felix
that
there
would
be
a
judgment
on
him
for
being
so
certain
sure
about
the
pills
and
the
elixir
and
now
lyon
said
the
poor
woman
who
had
dressed
herself
in
a
gown
previously
cast
off
a
front
all
out
of
curl
and
a
cap
with
no
starch
in
it
while
she
held
little
coughing
job
on
her
knee
and
now
you
see
my
words
have
come
true
sooner
than
i
thought
they
would
felix
may
contradict
me
if
he
will
but
there
he
is
in
prison
and
here
am
i
with
nothing
in
the
world
to
bless
myself
with
but
as
i
saved
by
my
own
scraping
and
this
house
i
got
to
pay
rent
for
it
not
me
has
done
wrong
lyon
there
nobody
can
say
it
of
me
not
the
orphan
child
on
my
knee
is
more
innicent
o
riot
and
murder
and
anything
else
as
is
bad
but
when
you
got
a
son
so
masterful
and
stopping
medicines
as
providence
has
sent
and
his
betters
have
been
taking
up
and
down
the
country
since
before
he
was
a
baby
it
o
no
use
being
good
here
below
but
he
a
baby
lyon
and
i
gave
him
the
breast
here
poor
holt
motherly
love
her
expository
eagerness
and
she
fell
more
and
more
to
crying
as
she
spoke
and
to
think
there
folks
saying
now
as
he
be
transported
and
his
hair
shaved
off
and
the
treadmill
and
everything
oh
dear
as
holt
broke
off
into
sobbing
little
job
also
who
had
got
a
confused
yet
profound
sense
of
sorrow
and
of
felix
being
hurt
and
gone
away
set
up
a
little
wail
of
wondering
misery
nay
mistress
holt
said
the
minister
soothingly
enlarge
not
your
grief
by
more
than
warrantable
grounds
i
have
good
hope
that
my
young
friend
your
son
will
be
delivered
from
any
severe
consequences
beyond
the
death
of
the
man
tucker
which
i
fear
will
ever
be
a
sore
burden
on
his
memory
i
feel
confident
that
a
jury
of
his
will
discern
between
misfortune
or
it
may
be
misjudgment
and
an
evil
will
and
that
he
will
be
acquitted
of
any
grave
offence
he
never
stole
anything
in
his
life
lyon
said
holt
reviving
nobody
can
throw
it
in
my
face
as
my
son
ran
away
with
money
like
the
young
man
at
the
bank
though
he
looked
most
respectable
and
far
different
on
a
sunday
to
what
felix
ever
did
and
i
know
it
very
hard
fighting
with
constables
but
they
say
tucker
wife
be
a
deal
better
off
than
she
was
before
for
the
great
folks
pension
her
and
she
be
put
on
all
the
charities
and
her
children
at
the
free
school
and
everything
your
trouble
easy
borne
when
everybody
gives
it
a
lift
for
you
and
if
judge
and
jury
wants
to
do
right
by
felix
they
think
of
his
poor
mother
with
the
bread
took
out
of
her
mouth
all
but
and
furniture
which
to
be
sure
is
most
excellent
and
of
my
own
buying
and
got
to
keep
this
orphin
child
as
felix
himself
brought
on
me
and
i
might
send
him
back
to
his
old
grandfather
on
parish
pay
but
i
not
that
woman
lyon
i
a
tender
heart
and
here
his
little
feet
and
toes
like
marbil
do
but
look
here
holt
drew
off
job
sock
and
shoe
and
showed
a
little
foot
and
you
perhaps
say
i
might
take
a
lodger
but
it
easy
talking
it
is
everybody
at
a
wants
a
parlor
and
a
bedroom
and
if
anything
bad
happens
to
felix
i
may
as
well
go
and
sit
in
the
parish
pound
and
nobody
to
buy
me
out
for
it
beyond
everything
how
the
church
members
find
fault
with
my
son
but
i
think
they
might
leave
his
mother
to
find
fault
for
queer
and
masterful
he
might
be
and
flying
in
the
face
of
the
very
scripture
about
the
physic
but
he
was
most
clever
beyond
anything
that
i
say
and
was
his
own
lawful
child
and
me
his
mother
that
was
mary
wall
thirty
years
before
ever
i
married
his
father
here
holt
feelings
again
became
too
much
for
her
but
she
struggled
on
to
say
sobbingly
and
if
they
to
transport
him
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
prison
and
take
the
orphin
child
for
he
was
most
fond
of
having
him
on
his
lap
and
said
never
marry
and
there
was
one
above
overheard
him
for
he
been
took
at
his
word
lyon
listened
with
low
groans
and
then
tried
to
comfort
her
by
saying
that
he
would
himself
go
to
loamford
as
soon
as
possible
and
would
give
his
soul
no
rest
till
he
had
done
all
he
could
do
for
felix
on
one
point
holt
plaint
tallied
with
his
own
forebodings
and
he
found
them
verified
the
state
of
feeling
in
treby
among
the
liberal
dissenting
flock
was
unfavorable
to
felix
none
who
had
observed
his
conduct
from
the
windows
saw
anything
tending
to
excuse
him
and
his
own
account
of
his
motives
given
on
his
examination
was
spoken
of
with
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
habit
of
always
thinking
himself
wiser
than
other
people
he
would
never
have
entertained
such
a
wild
scheme
he
had
set
himself
up
for
something
extraordinary
and
had
spoken
ill
of
respectable
he
had
put
a
stop
to
the
making
of
saleable
drugs
contrary
to
the
nature
of
buying
and
selling
and
to
a
due
reliance
on
what
providence
might
effect
in
the
human
inside
through
the
instrumentality
of
remedies
unsuitable
to
the
stomach
looked
at
in
a
merely
secular
light
and
the
result
was
what
might
have
been
expected
he
had
brought
his
mother
to
poverty
and
himself
into
trouble
and
what
for
he
had
done
no
good
to
the
cause
if
he
had
fought
about
or
had
been
worsted
in
some
struggle
in
which
he
was
distinctly
the
champion
of
dissent
and
liberalism
his
case
would
have
been
one
for
gold
silver
and
copper
subscriptions
in
order
to
procure
the
best
defence
sermons
might
have
been
preached
on
him
and
his
name
might
have
floated
on
flags
from
newcastle
to
dorchester
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
edification
in
what
had
befallen
felix
the
riot
at
treby
turn
it
which
way
you
would
as
muscat
observed
was
no
great
credit
to
liberalism
and
what
lyon
had
to
testify
as
to
felix
holt
conduct
in
the
matter
of
the
sproxton
men
only
made
it
clear
that
the
defence
of
felix
was
the
accusation
of
his
party
the
whole
affair
nuttwood
said
was
dark
and
inscrutable
and
seemed
not
to
be
one
in
which
the
interference
of
god
servants
would
tend
to
give
the
glory
where
the
glory
was
due
that
a
candidate
for
whom
the
richer
church
members
had
all
voted
should
have
his
name
associated
with
the
encouragement
of
drunkenness
riot
and
plunder
was
an
occasion
for
the
enemy
to
blaspheme
and
it
was
not
clear
how
the
enemy
mouth
would
be
stopped
by
exertions
in
favor
of
a
rash
young
man
whose
interference
had
made
things
worse
instead
of
better
lyon
was
warned
lest
his
human
partialities
should
blind
him
to
the
interests
of
truth
it
was
god
cause
that
was
endangered
in
this
matter
the
little
minister
soul
was
bruised
he
himself
was
keenly
alive
to
the
complication
of
public
and
private
regards
in
this
affair
and
suffered
a
good
deal
at
the
thought
of
tory
triumph
in
the
demonstration
that
excepting
the
attack
on
the
seven
stars
which
called
itself
a
whig
house
all
damage
to
property
had
been
borne
by
tories
he
cared
intensely
for
his
opinions
and
would
have
liked
events
to
speak
for
them
in
a
sort
of
that
everybody
could
understand
the
enthusiasms
of
the
world
are
not
to
be
stimulated
by
a
commentary
in
small
and
subtle
characters
which
alone
can
tell
the
whole
truth
and
the
picture
writing
in
felix
holt
troubles
was
of
an
entirely
puzzling
kind
if
he
were
a
martyr
neither
side
wanted
to
claim
him
yet
the
minister
as
we
have
seen
found
in
his
christian
faith
a
reason
for
clinging
the
more
to
one
who
had
not
a
large
party
to
back
him
that
little
man
heart
was
heroic
he
was
not
one
of
those
liberals
who
make
their
anxiety
for
the
cause
of
liberalism
a
plea
for
cowardly
desertion
besides
himself
he
believed
there
was
no
one
who
could
bear
testimony
to
the
remonstrances
of
felix
concerning
the
treating
of
the
sproxton
men
except
jermyn
johnson
and
harold
transome
though
he
had
the
vaguest
idea
of
what
could
be
done
in
the
case
he
fixed
his
mind
on
the
probability
that
transome
would
be
moved
to
the
utmost
exertion
if
only
as
an
atonement
but
he
dared
not
take
any
step
until
he
had
consulted
felix
who
he
foresaw
was
likely
to
have
a
very
strong
determination
as
to
the
help
he
would
accept
or
not
accept
this
last
expectation
was
fulfilled
lyon
returned
to
esther
after
his
day
journey
to
loamford
and
back
with
less
of
trouble
and
perplexity
in
his
mind
he
had
at
least
got
a
definite
course
marked
out
to
which
he
must
resign
himself
felix
had
declared
that
he
would
receive
no
aid
from
harold
transome
except
the
aid
he
might
give
as
an
honest
witness
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
him
but
what
was
perfectly
simple
and
direct
even
if
the
pleading
of
counsel
had
been
permitted
and
at
that
time
it
was
not
on
behalf
of
a
prisoner
on
trial
for
felony
felix
would
have
declined
it
he
would
in
any
case
have
spoken
in
his
own
defence
he
had
a
perfectly
simple
account
to
give
and
needed
not
to
avail
himself
of
any
legal
adroitness
he
consented
to
accept
the
services
of
a
respectable
solicitor
in
loamford
who
offered
to
conduct
his
case
without
any
fees
the
work
was
plain
and
easy
felix
said
the
only
witnesses
who
had
to
be
hunted
up
at
all
were
some
who
could
testify
that
he
had
tried
to
take
the
crowd
down
hobb
lane
and
that
they
had
gone
to
the
manor
in
spite
of
him
then
he
is
not
so
much
cast
down
as
you
feared
father
said
esther
no
child
albeit
he
is
pale
and
much
shaken
for
one
so
stalwart
he
hath
no
grief
he
says
save
for
the
poor
man
tucker
and
for
his
mother
otherwise
his
heart
is
without
a
burden
we
discoursed
greatly
on
the
sad
effect
of
all
this
for
his
mother
and
on
the
perplexed
condition
of
human
things
whereby
even
right
action
seems
to
bring
evil
consequences
if
we
have
respect
only
to
our
own
brief
lives
and
not
to
that
larger
rule
whereby
we
are
stewards
of
the
eternal
dealings
and
not
contrivers
of
our
own
success
did
he
say
nothing
about
me
father
said
esther
trembling
a
little
but
unable
to
repress
her
egoism
yes
he
asked
if
you
were
well
and
sent
his
affectionate
regards
nay
he
bade
me
say
something
which
appears
to
refer
to
your
discourse
together
when
i
was
not
present
her
he
said
they
sentence
me
to
she
knows
they
ca
rob
me
of
my
vocation
with
poverty
for
my
bride
and
preaching
and
pedagoguy
for
my
business
i
am
sure
of
a
handsome
establishment
he
laughed
doubtless
bearing
in
mind
some
playfulness
of
thine
lyon
seemed
to
be
looking
at
esther
as
he
smiled
but
she
was
not
near
enough
for
him
to
discern
the
expression
of
her
face
just
then
it
seemed
made
for
melancholy
rather
than
for
playfulness
hers
was
not
a
childish
beauty
and
when
the
sparkle
of
mischief
wit
and
vanity
was
out
of
her
eyes
and
the
large
look
of
abstracted
sorrow
was
there
you
would
have
been
surprised
by
a
certain
grandeur
which
the
smiles
had
hidden
that
changing
face
was
the
perfect
symbol
of
her
mixed
susceptible
nature
in
which
battle
was
inevitable
and
the
side
of
victory
uncertain
she
began
to
look
on
all
that
had
passed
between
herself
and
felix
as
something
not
buried
but
embalmed
and
kept
as
a
relic
in
a
private
sanctuary
the
very
entireness
of
her
preoccupation
about
him
the
perpetual
repetition
in
her
memory
of
all
that
had
passed
between
them
tended
to
produce
this
effect
she
lived
with
him
in
the
past
in
the
future
she
seemed
shut
out
from
him
he
was
an
influence
above
her
life
rather
than
a
part
of
it
some
time
or
other
perhaps
he
would
be
to
her
as
if
he
belonged
to
the
solemn
admonishing
skies
checking
her
pettiness
with
the
suggestion
of
a
wider
life
but
not
yet
not
while
her
trouble
was
so
fresh
for
it
was
still
trouble
and
not
felix
holt
perhaps
it
was
a
subtraction
from
his
power
over
her
that
she
could
never
think
of
him
with
pity
because
he
always
seemed
to
her
too
great
and
strong
to
be
pitied
he
wanted
nothing
he
evaded
calamity
by
choosing
privation
the
best
part
of
a
woman
love
is
worship
but
it
is
hard
to
her
to
be
sent
away
with
her
precious
spikenard
rejected
and
her
long
tresses
too
that
were
let
fall
ready
to
soothe
the
wearied
feet
while
esther
was
carrying
these
things
in
her
heart
the
january
days
were
beginning
to
pass
by
with
their
wonted
wintry
monotony
except
that
there
was
rather
more
of
good
cheer
than
usual
remaining
from
the
feast
of
twelfth
night
among
the
triumphant
tories
and
rather
more
scandal
than
usual
excited
among
the
mortified
dissenters
by
the
wilfulness
of
their
minister
he
had
actually
mentioned
felix
holt
by
name
in
his
evening
sermon
and
offered
up
a
petition
for
him
in
the
evening
prayer
also
by
name
not
as
a
young
ishmaelite
whom
he
would
fain
see
brought
back
from
the
lawless
life
of
the
desert
and
seated
in
the
same
fold
even
with
the
sons
of
judah
and
of
benjamin
a
suitable
periphrasis
which
brother
kemp
threw
off
without
any
effort
and
with
all
the
felicity
of
a
suggestive
critic
poor
holt
indeed
even
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
experienced
a
proud
satisfaction
that
though
she
was
not
a
church
member
she
was
now
an
object
of
congregational
remark
and
ministerial
allusion
feeling
herself
a
spotless
character
standing
out
in
relief
on
a
dark
background
of
affliction
and
a
practical
contradiction
to
that
extreme
doctrine
of
human
depravity
which
she
had
never
given
in
to
she
was
naturally
gratified
and
soothed
by
a
notice
which
must
be
a
recognition
but
more
influential
hearers
were
of
opinion
that
in
a
man
who
had
so
many
long
sentences
at
command
as
lyon
so
many
parentheses
and
modifying
clauses
this
naked
use
of
a
treby
name
in
an
address
to
the
almighty
was
all
the
more
offensive
in
a
low
unlettered
local
preacher
of
the
wesleyan
persuasion
such
things
might
pass
but
a
certain
style
in
prayer
was
demanded
from
independents
the
most
educated
body
in
the
ranks
of
orthodox
dissent
to
lyon
such
notions
seemed
painfully
perverse
and
the
next
morning
he
was
declaring
to
esther
his
resolution
stoutly
to
withstand
them
and
to
count
nothing
common
or
unclean
on
which
a
blessing
could
be
asked
when
the
tenor
of
his
thoughts
was
completely
changed
by
a
great
shock
of
surprise
which
made
both
himself
and
esther
sit
looking
at
each
other
in
speechless
amazement
the
cause
was
a
letter
brought
by
a
special
messenger
from
duffield
a
heavy
letter
addressed
to
esther
in
a
manner
quite
unexampled
in
her
correspondence
and
the
contents
of
the
letter
were
more
startling
than
its
exterior
it
began
madam
herewith
we
send
you
a
brief
abstract
of
evidence
which
has
come
within
our
knowledge
that
the
right
of
remainder
whereby
the
lineal
issue
of
edward
bycliffe
can
claim
possession
of
the
estates
of
which
the
entail
was
settled
by
john
justus
transome
in
now
first
accrues
to
you
as
the
sole
and
lawful
issue
of
maurice
christian
bycliffe
we
are
confident
of
success
in
the
prosecution
of
this
claim
which
will
result
to
you
in
the
possession
of
estates
to
the
value
at
the
lowest
of
from
five
to
six
thousand
per
annum
it
was
at
this
point
that
esther
who
was
reading
aloud
let
her
hand
fall
with
the
letter
on
her
lap
and
with
a
palpitating
heart
looked
at
her
father
who
looked
again
in
silence
that
lasted
for
two
or
three
minutes
a
certain
terror
was
upon
them
both
though
the
thoughts
that
laid
that
weight
on
the
tongue
of
each
were
different
it
was
lyon
who
spoke
first
this
then
is
what
the
man
named
christian
referred
to
i
distrusted
him
yet
it
seems
he
spoke
truly
but
said
esther
whose
imagination
ran
necessarily
to
those
conditions
of
wealth
which
she
could
best
appreciate
do
they
mean
that
the
transomes
would
be
turned
out
of
transome
court
and
that
i
should
go
and
live
there
it
seems
quite
an
impossible
thing
nay
child
i
know
not
i
am
ignorant
in
these
things
and
the
thought
of
worldly
grandeur
for
you
hath
more
of
terror
than
of
gladness
for
me
nevertheless
we
must
duly
weigh
all
things
not
considering
aught
that
befalls
us
as
a
bare
event
but
rather
as
an
occasion
for
faithful
stewardship
let
us
go
to
my
study
and
consider
this
writing
further
how
this
announcement
which
to
esther
seemed
as
unprepared
as
if
it
had
fallen
from
the
skies
came
to
be
made
to
her
by
solicitors
other
than
batt
cowley
the
old
lawyers
of
the
bycliffes
was
by
a
sequence
as
natural
that
is
to
say
as
legally
natural
as
any
in
the
world
the
secret
worker
of
the
apparent
wonder
was
johnson
who
on
the
very
day
when
he
wrote
to
give
his
patron
jermyn
the
serious
warning
that
a
bill
was
likely
to
be
filed
in
chancery
against
him
had
carried
forward
with
added
zeal
the
business
already
commenced
of
arranging
with
another
firm
his
share
in
the
profits
likely
to
result
from
the
prosecution
of
esther
bycliffe
claim
jermyn
star
was
certainly
going
down
and
johnson
did
not
feel
an

a

it
was

to
think

a
nut
that
jermyn
had
intended
to
keep
for
his
own
particular
cracking
and
which
would
be
rather
a
severe
astonishment
to
harold

whose
manners
towards
respectable
agents
were
such
as
leave
a
smart
in
a
man
of
spirit
under
the
stimulus
of

chapter
xxxviii
the
down
we
rest
on
in
our
aëry
dreams
has
not
been
plucked
from
birds
that
live
and
smart
is
but
warm
snow
that
melts
not
the
story
and
the
prospect
revealed
to
esther
by
the
lawyer
letter
which
she
and
her
father
studied
together
had
made
an
impression
on
her
very
different
from
what
she
had
been
used
to
figure
to
herself
in
her
many
as
to
the
effect
of
a
sudden
elevation
in
rank
and
fortune
in
her
she
had
not
traced
out
the
means
by
which
such
a
change
could
be
brought
about
in
fact
the
change
had
seemed
impossible
to
her
except
in
her
little
private
utopia
which
like
other
utopias
was
filled
with
delightful
results
independent
of
processes
but
her
mind
had
fixed
itself
habitually
on
the
signs
and
luxuries
of
ladyhood
for
which
she
had
the
keenest
perception
she
had
seen
the
very
mat
in
her
carriage
had
scented
the
dried
in
her
corridors
had
felt
the
soft
carpet
under
her
pretty
feet
and
seen
herself
as
she
rose
from
her
sofa
cushions
in
the
crystal
panel
that
reflected
a
long
where
the
conservatory
flowers
and
the
pictures
of
fair
women
left
her
still
with
the
supremacy
of
charm
she
had
trodden
the
gravel
of
her
and
the
soft
deep
turf
of
her
lawn
she
had
had
her
servants
about
her
filled
with
adoring
respect
because
of
her
kindness
as
well
as
her
grace
and
beauty
but
she
had
had
several
accomplished
cavaliers
all
at
once
sueing
for
her
hand
one
of
whom
uniting
very
high
birth
with
long
dark
eyelashes
and
the
most
distinguished
talents
she
secretly
preferred
though
his
pride
and
hers
hindered
an
avowal
and
supplied
the
inestimable
interest
of
retardation
the
glimpses
she
had
had
in
her
brief
life
as
a
family
governess
supplied
her
ready
faculty
with
details
enough
of
delightful
still
life
to
furnish
her
and
no
one
who
has
not
like
esther
a
strong
natural
prompting
and
susceptibility
toward
such
things
and
has
at
the
same
time
suffered
from
the
presence
of
opposite
conditions
can
understand
how
powerfully
those
minor
accidents
of
rank
which
please
the
fastidious
sense
can
preoccupy
the
imagination
it
seemed
that
almost
everything
in
her
cavaliers
apart
must
be
found
at
transome
court
but
now
that
fancy
was
becoming
real
and
the
impossible
appeared
possible
esther
found
the
balance
of
her
attention
reversed
now
that
her
ladyhood
was
not
simply
in
utopia
she
found
herself
arrested
and
painfully
grasped
by
the
means
through
which
the
ladyhood
was
to
be
obtained
to
her
inexperience
this
strange
story
of
an
alienated
inheritance
of
such
a
last
representative
of
lineage
as
old
thomas
transome
the
above
all
of
the
dispossession
hanging
over
those
who
actually
held
and
had
expected
always
to
hold
the
wealth
and
position
which
were
suddenly
announced
to
be
rightly
hers
all
these
things
made
a
picture
not
for
her
own
tastes
and
fancies
to
float
in
with
elysian
indulgence
but
in
which
she
was
compelled
to
gaze
on
the
degrading
hard
experience
of
other
human
beings
and
on
a
humiliating
loss
which
was
the
obverse
of
her
own
proud
gain
even
in
her
times
of
most
untroubled
egoism
esther
shrank
from
anything
ungenerous
and
the
fact
that
she
had
a
very
lively
image
of
harold
transome
and
his
boy
in
her
mind
gave
additional
distinctness
to
the
thought
that
if
she
entered
they
must
depart
of
the
elder
transomes
she
had
a
dimmer
vision
and
they
were
necessarily
in
the
background
to
her
sympathy
she
and
her
father
sat
with
their
hands
locked
as
they
might
have
done
if
they
had
been
listening
to
a
solemn
oracle
in
the
days
of
old
revealing
unknown
kinship
and
rightful
heirdom
it
was
not
that
esther
had
any
thought
of
renouncing
her
fortune
she
was
incapable
in
these
moments
of
condensing
her
vague
ideas
and
feelings
into
any
distinct
plan
of
action
nor
indeed
did
it
seem
that
she
was
called
upon
to
act
with
any
promptitude
it
was
only
that
she
was
conscious
of
being
strangely
awed
by
something
that
was
called
good
fortune
and
the
awe
shut
out
any
scheme
of
rejection
as
much
as
any
triumphant
joy
in
acceptance
her
father
she
learned
had
died
disappointed
and
in
wrongful
imprisonment
and
an
undefined
sense
of
nemesis
seemed
half
to
sanctify
her
inheritance
and
counteract
its
apparent
arbitrariness
felix
holt
was
present
in
her
mind
throughout
what
he
would
say
was
an
imaginary
commentary
that
she
was
constantly
framing
and
the
words
that
she
most
frequently
gave
him
for
she
dramatized
under
the
inspiration
of
a
sadness
slightly
bitter
were
of
this
kind
that
is
clearly
your
destiny
to
be
aristocratic
to
be
rich
i
always
saw
that
our
lots
lay
widely
apart
you
are
not
fit
for
poverty
or
any
work
of
difficulty
but
remember
what
i
once
said
to
you
about
a
vision
of
consequences
take
care
where
your
fortune
leads
you
her
father
had
not
spoken
since
they
had
ended
their
study
and
discussion
of
the
story
and
the
evidence
as
it
was
presented
to
them
into
this
he
had
entered
with
his
usual
penetrating
activity
but
he
was
so
accustomed
to
the
impersonal
study
of
narrative
that
even
in
these
exceptional
moments
the
habit
of
half
a
century
asserted
itself
and
he
seemed
sometimes
not
to
distinguish
the
case
of
esther
inheritance
from
a
story
in
ancient
history
until
some
detail
recalled
him
to
the
profound
feeling
that
a
great
great
change
might
be
coming
over
the
life
of
this
child
who
was
so
close
to
him
at
last
he
relapsed
into
total
silence
and
for
some
time
esther
was
not
moved
to
interrupt
it
he
had
sunk
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hand
locked
in
hers
and
was
pursuing
a
sort
of
prayerful
meditation
he
lifted
up
no
formal
petition
but
it
was
as
if
his
soul
travelled
again
over
the
facts
he
had
been
considering
in
the
company
of
a
guide
ready
to
inspire
and
correct
him
he
was
striving
to
purify
his
feeling
in
this
matter
from
selfish
or
worldly
dross
a
striving
which
is
that
prayer
without
ceasing
sure
to
wrest
an
answer
by
its
sublime
importunity
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
they
might
have
sat
in
this
way
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
inevitable
lyddy
reminding
them
dismally
of
dinner
yes
lyddy
we
come
said
esther
and
then
before
moving
is
there
any
advice
you
have
in
your
mind
for
me
father
the
sense
of
awe
was
growing
in
esther
her
intensest
life
was
no
longer
in
her
dreams
where
she
made
things
to
her
own
mind
she
was
moving
in
a
world
charged
with
forces
not
yet
my
dear
save
this
that
you
will
seek
special
illumination
in
this
juncture
and
above
all
be
watchful
that
your
soul
be
not
lifted
up
within
you
by
what
rightly
considered
is
rather
an
increase
of
charge
and
a
call
upon
you
to
walk
along
a
path
which
is
indeed
easy
to
the
flesh
but
dangerous
to
the
spirit
you
would
always
live
with
me
father
esther
said
under
a
strong
impulse
partly
affection
partly
the
need
to
grasp
at
some
moral
help
but
she
had
no
sooner
uttered
the
words
than
they
raised
a
vision
showing
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
the
incongruity
of
that
past
which
had
created
the
sanctities
and
affections
of
her
life
with
that
future
which
was
coming
to
her
the
little
rusty
old
minister
with
the
one
luxury
of
his
sunday
evening
pipe
smoked
up
the
kitchen
chimney
coming
to
live
in
the
midst
of
grandeur
but
no
her
father
with
the
grandeur
of
his
past
sorrow
and
his
long
struggling
labors
forsaking
his
vocation
and
vulgarly
accepting
an
existence
unsuited
to
esther
face
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
this
vision
and
its
reversed
interpretation
which
five
months
ago
she
would
have
been
incapable
of
seeing
her
question
to
her
father
seemed
like
a
mockery
she
was
ashamed
he
answered
slowly
touch
not
that
chord
yet
my
child
i
must
learn
to
think
of
thy
lot
according
to
the
demands
of
providence
we
will
rest
a
while
from
the
subject
and
i
will
seek
calmness
in
my
ordinary
duties
the
next
morning
nothing
more
was
said
lyon
was
absorbed
in
his
for
it
was
near
the
end
of
the
week
and
esther
was
obliged
to
attend
to
her
pupils
holt
came
by
invitation
with
little
job
to
share
their
dinner
of
and
after
much
of
what
the
minister
called
unprofitable
discourse
she
was
quitting
the
house
when
she
hastened
back
with
an
astonished
face
to
tell
lyon
and
esther
who
were
already
in
wonder
at
crashing
thundering
sounds
on
the
pavement
that
there
was
a
carriage
stopping
and
stamping
at
the
entry
into
malthouse
yard
with
all
sorts
of
fine
liveries
and
a
lady
and
gentleman
inside
lyon
and
esther
looked
at
each
other
both
having
the
same
name
in
their
minds
if
it
transome
or
somebody
else
as
is
great
lyon
urged
holt
you
remember
my
son
and
say
he
got
a
mother
with
a
character
they
may
enquire
into
as
much
as
they
like
and
never
mind
what
felix
says
for
he
so
masterful
he
stay
in
prison
and
be
transported
whether
or
no
only
to
have
his
own
way
for
it
not
to
be
thought
but
what
the
great
people
could
get
him
off
if
they
would
and
it
very
hard
with
a
king
in
the
country
and
all
the
texts
in
proverbs
about
the
king
countenance
and
solomon
and
the
live
baby
lyon
lifted
up
his
hand
deprecatingly
and
holt
retreated
from
the
to
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
the
outer
doorway
being
occupied
by
dominic
who
was
enquiring
if
and
miss
lyon
were
at
home
and
could
receive
transome
and
harold
transome
while
dominic
went
back
to
the
carriage
holt
escaped
with
her
tiny
companion
to
zachary
the
new
observing
to
lyddy
that
she
knew
herself
and
was
not
that
woman
to
stay
where
she
might
not
be
wanted
whereupon
lyddy
differing
fundamentally
admonished
her
parting
ear
that
it
was
well
if
she
knew
herself
to
be
dust
and
ashes
silently
extending
the
application
of
this
remark
to
transome
as
she
saw
the
tall
lady
sweep
in
arrayed
in
her
rich
black
and
fur
with
that
fine
gentleman
behind
her
whose
thick
of
wavy
hair
sparkling
ring
dark
complexion
and
general
air
of
worldly
exaltation
unconnected
with
chapel
were
painfully
suggestive
to
lyddy
of
herod
pontius
pilate
or
the
gallio
harold
transome
greeting
esther
gracefully
presented
his
mother
whose
glance
fixed
on
her
from
the
first
moment
of
entering
seemed
to
esther
to
pierce
her
through
transome
hardly
noticed
lyon
not
from
studied
haughtiness
but
from
sheer
mental
inability
to
consider
him
as
a
person
ignorant
of
natural
history
is
unable
to
consider
a
polyp
otherwise
than
as
a
sort
of
animated
weed
certainly
not
fit
for
table
but
harold
saw
that
his
mother
was
agreeably
struck
by
esther
who
indeed
showed
to
much
advantage
she
was
not
at
all
taken
by
surprise
and
maintained
a
dignified
quietude
but
her
previous
knowledge
and
reflection
about
the
possible
dispossession
of
these
transomes
gave
her
a
softened
feeling
toward
them
which
tinged
her
manners
very
agreeably
harold
was
carefully
polite
to
the
minister
throwing
out
a
word
to
make
him
understand
that
he
had
an
important
part
in
the
important
business
which
had
brought
this
unannounced
visit
and
the
four
made
a
group
seated
not
far
off
each
other
near
the
window
transome
and
esther
being
on
the
sofa
you
must
be
astonished
at
a
visit
from
me
miss
lyon
transome
began
i
seldom
come
to
treby
magna
now
i
see
you
the
visit
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
but
the
cause
of
my
coming
is
business
of
a
serious
nature
which
my
son
will
communicate
to
you
i
ought
to
begin
by
saying
that
what
i
have
to
announce
to
you
is
the
reverse
of
disagreeable
miss
lyon
said
harold
with
lively
ease
i
do
suppose
the
world
would
consider
it
very
good
news
for
me
but
a
rejected
candidate
lyon
harold
went
on
turning
graciously
to
the
minister
begins
to
be
inured
to
loss
and
misfortune
truly
sir
said
lyon
with
a
rather
sad
solemnity
your
allusion
hath
a
grievous
bearing
for
me
but
i
will
not
retard
your
present
purpose
by
further
remark
you
will
never
guess
what
i
have
to
disclose
said
harold
again
looking
at
esther
unless
indeed
you
have
already
had
some
previous
intimation
of
it
does
it
refer
to
law
and
inheritance
said
esther
with
a
smile
she
was
already
brightened
by
harold
manner
the
news
seemed
to
be
losing
its
chillness
and
to
be
something
really
belonging
to
warm
comfortable
interesting
life
then
you
have
already
heard
of
it
said
harold
inwardly
vexed
but
sufficiently
prepared
not
to
seem
so
only
yesterday
said
esther
quite
simply
i
received
a
letter
from
some
lawyers
with
a
statement
of
many
surprising
things
showing
that
i
was
an
heiress
here
she
turned
very
prettily
to
address
transome
which
as
you
may
imagine
is
one
of
the
last
things
i
could
have
supposed
myself
to
be
my
dear
said
transome
with
elderly
grace
just
laying
her
hand
for
an
instant
on
esther
it
is
a
lot
that
would
become
you
admirably
esther
blushed
and
said
playfully
oh
i
know
what
to
buy
with
fifty
pounds
but
i
know
the
price
of
nothing
beyond
that
her
father
sat
looking
at
her
through
his
spectacles
stroking
his
chin
it
was
amazing
to
herself
that
she
was
taking
so
lightly
now
what
had
caused
her
such
deep
emotion
yesterday
i
daresay
then
said
harold
you
are
more
fully
possessed
of
particulars
than
i
am
so
that
my
mother
and
i
need
only
tell
you
what
no
one
else
can
tell
you
that
is
what
are
her
and
my
feelings
and
wishes
under
these
new
and
unexpected
circumstances
i
am
most
anxious
said
esther
with
a
grave
beautiful
look
of
respect
to
transome
most
anxious
on
that
point
indeed
being
of
course
in
uncertainty
about
it
i
have
not
yet
known
whether
i
could
rejoice
transome
glance
had
softened
she
liked
esther
to
look
at
her
our
chief
anxiety
she
said
knowing
what
harold
wished
her
to
say
is
that
there
may
be
no
contest
no
useless
expenditure
of
money
of
course
we
will
surrender
what
can
be
rightfully
claimed
my
mother
expresses
our
feeling
precisely
miss
lyon
said
harold
and
i
sure
lyon
you
will
understand
our
desire
assuredly
sir
my
daughter
would
in
any
case
have
had
my
advice
to
seek
a
conclusion
which
would
involve
no
strife
we
endeavor
sir
in
our
body
to
hold
to
the
apostolic
rule
that
one
christian
brother
should
not
go
to
law
with
another
and
i
for
my
part
would
extend
this
rule
to
all
my
apprehending
that
the
practice
of
our
courts
is
little
consistent
with
the
simplicity
that
is
in
christ
if
it
is
to
depend
on
my
will
said
esther
there
is
nothing
that
would
be
more
repugnant
to
me
than
any
struggle
on
such
a
subject
but
ca
the
lawyers
go
on
doing
what
they
will
in
spite
of
me
it
seems
that
this
is
what
they
mean
not
exactly
said
harold
smiling
of
course
they
live
by
such
struggles
as
you
dislike
but
we
can
thwart
them
by
determining
not
to
quarrel
it
is
desirable
that
we
should
consider
the
affair
together
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
honorable
solicitors
i
assure
you
we
transomes
will
not
contend
for
what
is
not
our
own
and
this
is
what
i
have
come
to
beg
of
you
said
transome
it
is
that
you
will
come
to
transome
court
and
let
us
take
full
time
to
arrange
matters
do
oblige
me
you
shall
not
be
teased
more
than
you
like
by
an
old
woman
you
shall
do
just
as
you
please
and
become
acquainted
with
your
future
home
since
it
is
to
be
yours
i
can
tell
you
a
world
of
things
that
you
will
want
to
know
and
the
business
can
proceed
properly
do
consent
said
harold
with
winning
brevity
esther
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
bright
it
was
impossible
for
her
not
to
feel
that
the
proposal
was
a
more
tempting
step
toward
her
change
of
condition
than
she
could
have
thought
of
beforehand
she
had
forgotten
that
she
was
in
any
trouble
but
she
looked
toward
her
father
who
was
again
stroking
his
chin
as
was
his
habit
when
he
was
doubting
or
deliberating
i
hope
you
do
not
disapprove
of
miss
lyon
granting
us
this
favor
said
harold
to
the
minister
i
have
nothing
to
oppose
to
it
sir
if
my
daughter
own
mind
is
clear
as
to
her
course
you
will
come
now
with
us
said
transome
persuasively
you
will
go
back
with
us
now
in
the
carriage
harold
was
highly
gratified
with
the
perfection
of
his
mother
manner
on
this
occasion
which
he
had
looked
forward
to
as
difficult
since
he
had
come
home
again
he
had
never
seen
her
so
much
at
her
ease
or
with
so
much
benignancy
in
her
face
the
secret
lay
in
the
charm
of
sweet
young
deference
a
sort
of
charm
that
had
not
before
entered
into
transome
elderly
life
esther
pretty
behavior
it
must
be
confessed
was
not
fed
entirely
from
lofty
moral
sources
over
and
above
her
really
generous
feeling
she
enjoyed
transome
accent
the
quietness
of
her
speech
the
delicate
odor
of
her
drapery
she
had
always
thought
that
life
must
be
particularly
easy
if
one
could
pass
it
among
refined
people
and
so
it
seemed
at
this
moment
she
wished
unmixedly
to
go
to
transome
court
since
my
father
has
no
objection
she
said
and
you
urge
me
so
kindly
but
i
must
beg
for
time
to
pack
up
a
few
clothes
by
all
means
said
transome
we
are
not
at
all
pressed
when
esther
had
left
the
room
harold
said
apart
from
our
immediate
reason
for
coming
lyon
i
could
have
wished
to
see
you
about
these
unhappy
consequences
of
the
election
contest
but
you
will
understand
that
i
have
been
much
preoccupied
with
private
affairs
you
have
well
said
that
the
consequences
are
unhappy
sir
and
but
for
a
reliance
on
something
more
than
human
calculation
i
know
not
which
i
should
most
bewail
the
scandal
which
has
brought
on
right
principles
or
the
snares
which
it
laid
for
the
feet
of
a
young
man
who
is
dear
to
me
soweth
and
another
reapeth
is
a
verity
that
applies
to
evil
as
well
as
good
you
are
referring
to
felix
holt
i
have
not
neglected
steps
to
secure
the
best
legal
help
for
the
prisoners
but
i
am
given
to
understand
that
holt
refuses
any
aid
from
me
i
hope
he
will
not
go
rashly
to
work
in
speaking
in
his
own
defence
without
any
legal
instruction
it
is
an
opprobrium
of
our
law
that
no
counsel
is
allowed
to
plead
for
the
prisoner
in
cases
of
felony
a
ready
tongue
may
do
a
man
as
much
harm
as
good
in
a
court
of
justice
he
piques
himself
on
making
a
display
and
displays
a
little
too
much
sir
you
know
him
not
said
the
little
minister
in
his
deeper
tone
he
would
not
accept
even
if
it
were
accorded
a
defense
wherein
the
truth
was
screened
or
avoided
not
from
a
vainglorious
spirit
of
for
he
hath
a
singular
directness
and
simplicity
of
speech
but
from
an
averseness
to
a
profession
wherein
a
man
may
without
shame
seek
to
justify
the
wicked
for
reward
and
take
away
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
from
him
it
a
pity
a
fine
young
fellow
should
do
himself
harm
by
fanatical
notions
of
that
sort
i
could
at
least
have
procured
the
advantage
of
consultation
he
did
look
to
me
like
a
dreamy
personage
nor
is
he
dreamy
rather
his
excess
lies
in
being
too
practical
well
i
hope
you
will
not
encourage
him
in
such
irrationality
the
question
is
not
one
of
misrepresentation
but
of
adjusting
fact
so
as
to
raise
it
to
the
power
of
evidence
do
you
see
that
i
do
i
do
but
i
distrust
not
felix
holt
discernment
in
regard
to
his
own
case
he
builds
not
on
doubtful
things
and
hath
no
illusory
hopes
on
the
contrary
he
is
of
a
incredulity
where
i
would
fain
see
a
more
childlike
faith
but
he
will
hold
no
belief
without
action
corresponding
thereto
and
the
occasion
of
his
return
to
this
his
native
place
at
a
time
which
has
proved
fatal
was
no
other
than
his
resolve
to
hinder
the
sale
of
some
drugs
which
had
chiefly
supported
his
mother
but
which
his
better
knowledge
showed
him
to
be
pernicious
to
the
human
frame
he
undertook
to
support
her
by
his
own
labor
but
sir
i
pray
you
to
mark
and
old
as
i
am
i
will
not
deny
that
this
young
man
instructs
me
herein
i
pray
you
to
mark
the
poisonous
confusion
of
good
and
evil
which
is
the
effect
of
vicious
practices
through
the
use
of
undue
electioneering
means
concerning
which
however
i
do
not
accuse
you
farther
than
of
having
acted
the
part
of
him
who
washes
his
hands
when
he
delivers
up
to
others
the
exercise
of
an
iniquitous
power
felix
holt
is
i
will
not
scruple
to
say
the
innocent
victim
of
a
riot
and
that
deed
of
strict
honesty
whereby
he
took
on
himself
the
charge
of
his
aged
mother
seems
now
to
have
deprived
her
of
sufficient
bread
and
is
even
an
occasion
of
reproach
to
him
from
the
weaker
brethren
i
shall
be
proud
to
supply
her
as
amply
as
you
think
desirable
said
harold
not
enjoying
this
lecture
i
will
pray
you
to
speak
of
this
question
with
my
daughter
who
it
appears
may
herself
have
large
means
at
command
and
would
desire
to
minister
to
holt
needs
with
all
friendship
and
delicacy
for
the
present
i
can
take
care
that
she
lacks
nothing
essential
as
lyon
was
speaking
esther
equipped
for
her
drive
she
laid
her
hand
on
her
father
arm
and
said
you
will
let
my
pupils
know
at
once
will
you
father
doubtless
my
dear
said
the
old
man
trembling
a
little
under
the
feeling
that
this
departure
of
esther
was
a
crisis
nothing
again
would
be
as
it
had
been
in
their
mutual
life
but
he
feared
that
he
was
being
mastered
by
a
too
tender
and
struggled
to
keep
himself
calm
transome
and
harold
had
both
risen
if
you
are
quite
ready
miss
lyon
said
harold
divining
that
the
father
and
daughter
would
like
to
have
an
unobserved
moment
i
will
take
my
mother
to
the
carriage
and
come
back
for
you
when
they
were
alone
esther
put
her
hands
on
her
father
shoulders
and
kissed
him
this
will
not
be
a
grief
to
you
i
hope
father
you
think
it
is
better
that
i
should
go
nay
child
i
am
weak
but
i
would
fain
be
capable
of
a
joy
quite
apart
from
the
accidents
of
my
aged
earthly
existence
which
indeed
is
a
petty
and
almost
fountain
whereas
to
the
receptive
soul
the
river
of
life
pauses
not
nor
is
diminished
perhaps
you
will
see
felix
holt
again
and
tell
him
all
shall
i
say
aught
to
him
for
you
oh
no
only
that
job
tudge
has
a
little
flannel
shirt
and
a
box
of
lozenges
said
esther
smiling
ah
i
hear
transome
coming
back
i
must
say
to
lyddy
else
she
will
cry
over
my
hard
heart
in
spite
of
all
the
grave
thoughts
that
had
been
esther
felt
it
a
very
pleasant
as
well
as
new
experience
to
be
led
to
the
carriage
by
harold
transome
to
be
seated
on
soft
cushions
and
bowled
along
looked
at
admiringly
and
deferentially
by
a
person
opposite
whom
it
was
agreeable
to
look
at
in
return
and
talked
to
with
suavity
and
liveliness
toward
what
prospect
was
that
easy
carriage
really
leading
her
she
could
not
be
always
asking
herself
questions
her
young
bright
nature
was
rather
weary
of
the
sadness
that
had
grown
heavier
in
these
last
weeks
like
a
chill
white
mist
hopelessly
veiling
the
day
her
fortune
was
beginning
to
appear
worthy
of
being
called
good
fortune
she
had
come
to
a
new
stage
in
her
journey
a
new
day
had
arisen
on
new
scenes
and
her
young
untired
spirit
was
full
of
curiosity
chapter

no
man
believes
that
knowledge
and
skill
as
a
just
idea
of
the
solar
system
or
the
power
of
painting
flesh
or
of
reading
written
harmonies
can
come
late
and
of
a
sudden
yet
many
will
not
stick
at
believing
that
happiness
can
come
at
any
day
and
hour
solely
by
a
new
disposition
of
events
though
there
is
naught
less
capable
of
a
magical
production
than
a
mortal
happiness
which
is
mainly
a
complex
of
habitual
relations
and
dispositions
not
to
be
wrought
by
news
from
foreign
parts
or
any
whirling
of
fortune
wheel
for
one
on
whose
brow
time
has
written
legibly
some
days
after
esther
arrival
at
transome
court
denner
coming
to
dress
transome
before
dinner
a
labor
of
love
for
which
she
had
ample
leisure
now
found
her
mistress
seated
with
more
than
ever
of
a
marble
aspect
of
suffering
which
to
the
keen
observation
had
been
gradually
intensifying
itself
during
the
past
week
she
had
tapped
at
the
door
without
having
been
summoned
and
she
had
ventured
to
enter
though
she
had
heard
no
voice
saying
come
in
transome
had
on
a
dark
warm
hanging
in
thick
folds
about
her
and
she
was
seated
before
a
mirror
which
filled
a
panel
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
the
room
was
bright
with
the
light
of
the
fire
and
of
wax
candles
for
some
reason
contrary
to
her
usual
practice
transome
had
herself
unfastened
her
abundant
gray
hair
which
rolled
backward
in
a
pale
sunless
stream
over
her
dark
dress
she
was
seated
before
the
mirror
apparently
looking
at
herself
her
brow
knit
in
one
deep
furrow
and
her
jewelled
hands
laid
one
above
the
other
on
her
knee
probably
she
had
ceased
to
see
the
reflection
in
the
mirror
for
her
eyes
had
the
fixed
look
that
belongs
not
to
examination
but
to
reverie
motionless
in
that
way
her
features
keeping
distinct
record
of
past
beauty
she
looked
like
an
image
faded
dried
and
bleached
by
uncounted
suns
rather
than
a
breathing
woman
who
had
numbered
the
years
as
they
passed
and
had
a
consciousness
within
her
which
was
the
slow
deposit
of
those
ceaseless
roiling
years
denner
with
all
her
ingrained
and
systematic
reserve
could
not
help
showing
signs
that
she
was
startled
when
peering
from
between
her
eyelids
she
saw
the
motionless
image
in
the
mirror
opposite
to
her
as
she
entered
her
gentle
opening
of
the
door
had
not
roused
her
mistress
to
whom
the
sensations
produced
by
denner
presence
were
as
little
disturbing
as
those
of
a
favorite
cat
but
the
slight
cry
and
the
start
reflected
in
the
glass
were
unusual
enough
to
break
the
reverie
transome
moved
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
said
so
you
come
at
last
denner
yes
madam
it
is
not
late
i
sorry
you
should
have
undone
your
hair
yourself
i
undid
it
to
see
what
an
old
hag
i
am
these
fine
clothes
you
put
on
me
denner
are
only
a
smart
shroud
pray
do
talk
so
madam
if
there
anybody
does
think
it
pleasant
to
look
at
you
so
much
the
worse
for
them
for
my
part
i
seen
no
young
ones
fit
to
hold
up
your
train
look
at
your
likeness
down
below
and
though
you
older
now
what
signifies
i
would
be
letty
in
the
scullery
because
she
got
red
cheeks
she
may
know
she
a
poor
creature
but
i
know
it
and
that
enough
for
me
i
know
what
sort
of
a
dowdy
draggletail
she
be
in
ten
years
time
i
would
change
with
nobody
madam
and
if
troubles
were
put
up
to
market
i
sooner
buy
old
than
new
it
something
to
have
seen
the
worst
a
woman
never
has
seen
the
worst
till
she
is
old
denner
said
transome
bitterly
the
keen
little
was
not
clear
as
to
the
cause
of
her
mistress
added
bitterness
but
she
rarely
brought
herself
to
ask
questions
when
transome
did
not
authorize
them
by
beginning
to
give
her
information
banks
the
bailiff
and
the
had
nodded
and
winked
a
good
deal
over
the
certainty
that
harold
was
none
so
fond
of
jermyn
but
this
was
a
subject
on
which
transome
had
never
made
up
her
mind
to
speak
and
denner
knew
nothing
definite
again
she
felt
quite
sure
that
there
was
some
important
secret
connected
with
esther
presence
in
the
house
she
suspected
that
the
close
dominic
knew
the
secret
and
was
more
trusted
than
she
was
in
spite
of
her
forty
years
service
but
any
resentment
on
this
ground
would
have
been
an
entertained
reproach
against
her
mistress
inconsistent
with
creed
and
character
she
inclined
to
the
belief
that
esther
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
new
discontent
if
there
anything
worse
coming
to
you
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
is
madam
she
said
after
a
moment
silence
speaking
always
in
the
same
low
quick
way
and
keeping
up
her
quiet
labors
when
i
awake
at
i
sooner
have
one
real
grief
on
my
mind
than
twenty
false
it
better
to
know
one
robbed
than
to
think
one
going
to
be
murdered
i
believe
you
are
the
creature
in
the
world
that
loves
me
best
denner
yet
you
will
never
understand
what
i
suffer
it
of
no
use
telling
you
there
no
folly
in
you
and
no
heartache
you
are
made
of
iron
you
have
never
had
any
trouble
i
had
some
of
your
trouble
madam
yes
you
good
thing
but
as
a
that
never
caught
the
fever
you
never
even
had
a
child
i
can
feel
for
things
i
never
went
through
i
used
to
be
sorry
for
the
poor
french
queen
when
i
was
young
i
have
lain
cold
for
her
to
lie
warm
i
know
people
have
feelings
according
to
their
birth
and
station
and
you
always
took
things
to
heart
madam
beyond
anybody
else
but
i
hope
there
nothing
new
to
make
you
talk
of
the
worst
yes
denner
there
is
there
is
said
transome
speaking
in
a
low
tone
of
misery
while
she
bent
for
her
to
be
pinned
on
is
it
this
young
lady
why
what
do
you
think
about
her
denner
said
transome
in
a
tone
of
more
spirit
rather
curious
to
hear
what
the
old
woman
would
say
i
do
deny
she
graceful
and
she
has
a
pretty
smile
and
very
good
manners
it
quite
unaccountable
by
what
banks
says
about
her
father
i
know
nothing
of
those
treby
townsfolk
myself
but
for
my
part
puzzled
i
fond
of
harold
i
always
shall
be
madam
i
was
at
his
bringing
into
the
world
and
nothing
but
his
doing
wrong
by
you
would
turn
me
against
him
but
the
servants
all
say
he
in
love
with
miss
lyon
i
wish
it
were
true
denner
said
transome
energetically
i
wish
he
were
in
love
with
her
so
that
she
could
master
him
and
make
him
do
what
she
pleased
then
it
is
not
true
what
they
say
not
true
that
she
will
ever
master
him
no
woman
ever
will
he
will
make
her
fond
of
him
and
afraid
of
him
that
one
of
the
things
you
have
never
gone
through
denner
a
woman
love
is
always
freezing
into
fear
she
wants
everything
she
is
secure
of
nothing
this
girl
has
a
fine
spirit
plenty
of
fire
and
pride
and
wit
men
like
such
captives
as
they
like
horses
that
champ
the
bit
and
paw
the
ground
they
feel
more
triumph
in
their
mastery
what
is
the
use
of
a
woman
will
if
she
tries
she
does
get
it
and
she
ceases
to
be
loved
god
was
cruel
when
he
made
women
denner
was
used
to
such
outbursts
as
this
her
mistress
rhetoric
and
temper
belonged
to
her
superior
rank
her
grand
person
and
her
piercing
black
eyes
transome
had
a
sense
of
impiety
in
her
words
which
made
them
all
the
more
tempting
to
her
impotent
anger
the
had
none
of
that
awe
which
could
be
turned
into
defiance
the
sacred
grove
was
a
common
thicket
to
her
it
may
be
good
luck
to
be
a
woman
she
said
but
one
begins
with
it
from
a
baby
one
gets
used
to
it
and
i
should
like
to
be
a
man
to
cough
so
loud
and
stand
straddling
about
on
a
wet
day
and
be
so
wasteful
with
meat
and
drink
they
a
coarse
lot
i
think
then
i
need
make
a
trouble
of
this
young
lady
madam
she
added
after
a
moment
pause
no
denner
i
like
her
if
that
were
all
i
should
like
harold
to
marry
her
it
would
be
the
best
thing
if
the
truth
were
known
and
it
will
be
known
soon
the
estate
is
hers
by
law
such
law
as
it
is
it
a
strange
story
she
a
bycliffe
really
denner
did
not
look
amazed
but
went
on
fastening
her
mistress
dress
as
she
said
well
madam
i
was
sure
there
was
something
wonderful
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
turning
the
old
lawsuits
and
everything
else
over
in
my
mind
i
thought
the
law
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
then
she
is
a
born
lady
yes
she
has
good
blood
in
her
veins
we
talked
that
over
in
the
housekeeper
room
what
a
hand
and
an
instep
she
has
and
how
her
head
is
set
on
her
shoulders
almost
like
your
own
madam
but
her
lightish
complexion
spoils
her
to
my
thinking
and
dominic
said
harold
never
admired
that
sort
of
woman
before
there
nothing
that
smooth
fellow
could
tell
you
if
he
would
he
knows
the
answer
to
riddles
before
they
made
however
he
knows
how
to
hold
his
tongue
i
say
that
for
him
and
so
do
i
madam
yes
yes
you
will
not
talk
of
it
till
other
people
are
talking
of
it
and
so
if
harold
married
her
it
would
save
all
fuss
and
mischief
yes
about
the
estate
and
he
seems
inclined
and
she
not
refuse
him
i
answer
for
it
and
you
like
her
madam
there
everything
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
denner
was
putting
the
to
transome
dress
by
throwing
an
indian
scarf
over
her
shoulders
and
so
completing
the
contrast
between
the
majestic
lady
in
costume
and
the
dishevelled
woman
whom
she
had
found
half
an
hour
before
i
am
not
at
rest
transome
said
with
slow
distinctness
moving
from
the
mirror
to
the
window
where
the
blind
was
not
drawn
down
and
she
could
see
the
chill
white
landscape
and
the
unheeding
stars
denner
more
distressed
by
her
mistress
suffering
than
she
could
have
been
by
anything
else
took
up
with
the
instinct
of
affection
a
gold
vinaigrette
which
transome
often
liked
to
carry
with
her
and
going
up
to
her
put
it
into
her
hand
gently
transome
grasped
the
little
woman
hand
hard
and
held
it
so
denner
she
said
in
a
low
tone
if
i
could
choose
at
this
moment
i
would
choose
that
harold
should
never
have
been
born
nay
my
dear
denner
had
only
once
before
in
her
life
said
my
dear
to
her
mistress
it
was
a
happiness
to
you
then
i
do
believe
i
felt
the
happiness
then
as
i
feel
the
misery
now
it
is
foolish
to
say
people
ca
feel
much
when
they
are
getting
old
not
pleasure
perhaps
little
comes
but
they
can
feel
they
are
forsaken
why
every
fibre
in
me
seems
to
be
a
memory
that
makes
a
pang
they
can
feel
that
all
the
love
in
their
lives
is
turned
to
hatred
or
contempt
not
mine
madam
not
mine
let
what
would
be
i
should
want
to
live
for
your
sake
for
fear
you
should
have
nobody
to
do
for
you
as
i
would
ah
then
you
are
a
happy
woman
denner
you
have
loved
somebody
for
forty
years
who
is
old
and
weak
now
and
ca
do
without
you
the
sound
of
the
resounded
below
and
transome
let
the
faithful
hand
fall
again
chapter
xl
she
beautiful
and
therefore
to
be
wooed
she
is
a
woman
therefore
to
be
won
if
denner
had
had
a
suspicion
that
esther
presence
at
transome
court
was
not
agreeable
to
her
mistress
it
was
impossible
to
entertain
such
a
suspicion
with
regard
to
the
other
members
of
the
family
between
her
and
little
harry
there
was
an
extraordinary
fascination
this
creature
with
the
soft
broad
brown
cheeks
low
forehead
great
black
eyes
tiny
nose
fierce
biting
tricks
toward
every
person
and
thing
he
disliked
and
insistence
on
entirely
occupying
those
he
liked
was
a
human
specimen
such
as
esther
had
never
seen
before
and
she
seemed
to
be
equally
original
in
harry
experience
at
first
sight
her
light
complexion
and
her
blue
gown
probably
also
her
sunny
smile
and
her
hands
stretched
out
toward
him
seemed
to
make
a
show
for
him
as
of
a
new
sort
of
bird
he
threw
himself
backward
against
his
gappa
as
he
called
old
transome
and
stared
at
this
new
comer
with
the
gravity
of
a
wild
animal
but
she
had
no
sooner
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
library
than
he
climbed
up
to
her
and
began
to
treat
her
as
an
attractive
object
in
natural
history
snatched
up
her
curls
with
his
brown
fist
and
discovering
that
there
was
a
little
ear
under
them
pinched
it
and
blew
into
it
pulled
at
her
coronet
of
plaits
and
seemed
to
discover
with
satisfaction
that
it
did
not
grow
at
the
summit
of
her
head
but
could
be
dragged
down
and
altogether
undone
then
finding
that
she
laughed
tossed
him
back
kissed
and
pretended
to
bite
him
in
fact
was
an
animal
that
understood
fun
he
rushed
off
and
made
dominic
bring
a
small
menagerie
of
white
mice
squirrels
and
birds
with
moro
the
black
spaniel
to
make
her
acquaintance
whomsoever
harry
liked
it
followed
that
transome
must
like
gappa
along
with
nimrod
the
retriever
was
part
of
the
menagerie
and
perhaps
endured
more
than
all
the
other
live
creatures
in
the
way
of
being
tumbled
about
seeing
that
esther
bore
having
her
hair
pulled
down
quite
merrily
and
that
she
was
willing
to
be
harnessed
and
beaten
the
old
man
began
to
confide
to
her
in
his
feeble
smiling
and
rather
jerking
fashion
harry
remarkable
feats
how
he
had
one
day
when
gappy
was
asleep
unpinned
a
whole
drawerful
of
beetles
to
see
if
they
would
fly
away
then
disgusted
with
their
stupidity
was
about
to
throw
them
all
on
the
ground
and
stamp
on
them
when
dominic
came
in
and
rescued
these
valuable
specimens
also
how
he
had
subtly
watched
transome
at
the
cabinet
where
she
kept
her
medicines
and
when
she
had
left
it
for
a
little
while
without
locking
it
had
gone
to
the
drawers
and
scattered
half
the
contents
on
the
floor
but
what
old
transome
thought
the
most
wonderful
proof
of
an
almost
preternatural
cleverness
was
that
harry
would
hardly
ever
talk
but
preferred
making
inarticulate
noises
or
combining
syllables
after
a
method
of
his
own
he
can
talk
well
enough
if
he
likes
said
gappa
evidently
thinking
that
harry
like
the
monkeys
had
deep
reasons
for
his
reticence
you
mind
him
he
added
nodding
at
esther
and
shaking
with
laughter
you
hear
he
knows
the
right
names
of
things
well
enough
but
he
likes
to
make
his
own
he
give
you
one
all
to
yourself
before
long
and
when
harry
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
distinctly
that
name
was
boo
transome
nodded
at
her
with
triumphant
satisfaction
and
then
told
her
in
a
low
whisper
looking
round
cautiously
beforehand
that
harry
would
never
call
transome
gamma
but
always
bite
it
wonderful
said
he
laughing
slyly
the
old
man
seemed
so
happy
now
in
the
new
world
created
for
him
by
dominic
and
harry
that
he
would
perhaps
have
made
a
holocaust
of
his
flies
and
beetles
if
it
had
been
necessary
in
order
to
keep
this
living
lively
kindness
about
him
he
no
longer
confined
himself
to
the
library
but
shuffled
along
from
room
to
room
staying
and
looking
on
at
what
was
going
forward
whenever
he
did
not
find
transome
alone
to
esther
the
sight
of
this
timid
paralytic
man
who
had
long
abdicated
all
mastery
over
the
things
that
were
his
was
something
piteous
certainly
this
had
never
been
part
of
the
furniture
she
had
imagined
for
the
delightful
aristocratic
dwelling
in
her
utopia
and
the
sad
irony
of
such
a
lot
impressed
her
the
more
because
in
her
father
she
was
accustomed
to
age
accompanied
with
mental
acumen
and
activity
her
thoughts
went
back
in
conjecture
over
the
past
life
of
and
transome
a
couple
so
strangely
different
from
each
other
she
found
it
impossible
to
arrange
their
existence
in
the
seclusion
of
this
fine
park
and
in
this
lofty
house
where
it
seemed
quite
ridiculous
to
be
anything
so
small
as
a
human
being
without
finding
it
rather
dull
transome
had
always
had
his
beetles
but
transome
it
was
not
easy
to
conceive
that
the
husband
and
wife
had
ever
been
very
fond
of
each
other
esther
felt
at
her
ease
with
transome
she
was
gratified
by
the
consciousness
for
on
this
point
esther
was
very
quick
that
transome
admired
her
and
looked
at
her
with
satisfied
eyes
but
when
they
were
together
in
the
early
days
of
her
stay
the
conversation
turned
chiefly
on
what
happened
in
transome
youth
what
she
wore
when
she
was
presented
at
court
who
were
the
most
distinguished
and
beautiful
women
at
that
time
the
terrible
excitement
of
the
french
revolution
the
emigrants
she
had
known
and
the
history
of
various
titled
members
of
the
lingon
family
and
esther
from
native
delicacy
did
not
lead
to
more
recent
topics
of
a
personal
kind
she
was
copiously
instructed
that
the
lingon
family
was
better
than
that
even
of
the
elder
transomes
and
was
privileged
with
an
explanation
of
the
various
quarterings
which
proved
that
the
lingon
blood
had
been
continually
enriched
poor
transome
with
her
secret
bitterness
and
dread
still
found
a
flavor
in
this
sort
of
pride
none
the
less
because
certain
deeds
of
her
own
life
had
been
in
fatal
inconsistency
with
it
besides
genealogies
entered
into
her
stock
of
ideas
and
her
talk
on
such
subjects
was
as
necessary
as
the
notes
of
the
linnet
or
the
blackbird
she
had
no
ultimate
analysis
of
things
that
went
beyond
blood
and
family
the
herons
of
fenshore
or
the
badgers
of
hillbury
she
had
never
seen
behind
the
canvas
with
which
her
life
was
hung
in
the
dim
background
there
was
the
burning
mount
and
the
tables
of
the
law
in
the
foreground
there
was
lady
debarry
privately
gossipping
about
her
and
lady
wyvern
finally
deciding
not
to
send
her
invitations
to
dinner
unlike
that
semiramis
who
made
laws
to
suit
her
practical
license
she
lived
poor
soul
in
the
midst
of
desecrated
sanctities
and
of
honors
that
looked
tarnished
in
the
light
of
monotonous
and
weary
suns
glimpses
of
the
lingon
heraldry
in
their
freshness
were
interesting
to
esther
but
it
occurred
to
her
that
when
she
had
known
about
them
a
good
while
they
would
cease
to
be
succulent
themes
of
converse
or
meditation
and
transome
having
known
them
all
along
might
have
felt
a
vacuum
in
spite
of
them
nevertheless
it
was
entertaining
at
present
to
be
seated
on
soft
cushions
with
her
netting
before
her
while
transome
went
on
with
her
embroidery
and
told
in
that
easy
phrase
and
with
that
refined
tone
and
accent
which
she
possessed
in
perfection
family
stories
that
to
esther
were
like
so
many
novelettes
what
diamonds
were
in
the
earl
family
own
cousins
to
transome
how
poor
lady
husband
went
off
into
jealous
madness
only
a
month
after
their
marriage
and
dragged
that
sweet
thing
by
the
hair
and
how
the
brilliant
fanny
having
married
a
country
parson
became
so
niggardly
that
she
had
gone
about
almost
begging
for
fresh
eggs
from
the
wives
though
she
had
done
very
well
with
her
six
sons
as
there
was
a
bishop
and
no
end
of
interest
in
the
family
and
two
of
them
got
appointments
in
india
at
present
transome
did
not
touch
at
all
on
her
own
time
of
privation
or
her
troubles
with
her
eldest
son
or
on
anything
that
lay
very
close
to
her
heart
she
conversed
with
esther
and
acted
the
part
of
hostess
as
she
performed
her
toilet
and
went
on
with
her
embroidery
these
things
were
to
be
done
whether
one
were
happy
or
miserable
even
the
patriarch
job
if
he
had
been
a
gentleman
of
the
modern
west
would
have
avoided
picturesque
disorder
and
poetical
laments
and
the
friends
who
called
on
him
though
not
less
disposed
than
bildad
the
shuhite
to
hint
that
their
unfortunate
friend
was
in
the
wrong
would
have
sat
on
chairs
and
held
their
hats
in
their
hands
the
harder
problems
of
our
life
have
changed
less
than
our
manners
we
wrestle
with
the
old
sorrows
but
more
decorously
esther
inexperience
prevented
her
from
divining
much
about
this
fine
woman
whom
she
could
not
help
perceiving
to
stand
apart
from
the
family
group
as
if
there
were
some
cause
of
isolation
for
her
both
within
and
without
to
her
young
heart
there
was
a
peculiar
interest
in
transome
an
elderly
woman
whose
beauty
position
and
graceful
kindness
toward
herself
made
deference
to
her
spontaneous
was
a
new
figure
in
esther
experience
her
quick
light
movement
was
always
ready
to
anticipate
what
transome
wanted
her
bright
apprehension
and
silvery
speech
were
always
ready
to
cap
transome
narratives
or
instructions
even
about
doses
and
liniments
with
some
lively
commentary
she
must
have
behaved
charmingly
for
one
day
when
she
had
tripped
across
the
room
to
put
the
screen
just
in
the
right
place
transome
said
taking
her
hand
my
dear
you
make
me
wish
i
had
a
daughter
that
was
pleasant
and
so
it
was
to
be
decked
by
transome
own
hands
in
a
set
of
turquoise
ornaments
which
became
her
wonderfully
worn
with
a
white
cashmere
dress
which
was
also
insisted
on
esther
never
reflected
that
there
was
a
double
intention
in
these
pretty
ways
toward
her
with
young
generosity
she
was
rather
preoccupied
by
the
desire
to
prove
that
she
herself
entertained
no
low
triumph
in
the
fact
that
she
had
rights
prejudicial
to
this
family
whose
life
she
was
learning
and
besides
through
all
transome
perfect
manners
there
pierced
some
undefinable
indications
of
a
hidden
anxiety
much
deeper
than
anything
she
could
feel
about
this
affair
of
the
estate
to
which
she
often
alluded
slightly
as
a
reason
for
informing
esther
of
something
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
her
for
a
happy
woman
and
young
speculation
is
always
stirred
by
discontent
for
which
there
is
no
obvious
cause
when
we
are
older
we
take
the
uneasy
eyes
and
the
bitter
lips
more
as
a
matter
of
course
but
harold
transome
was
more
communicative
about
recent
years
than
his
mother
was
he
thought
it
well
that
esther
should
know
how
the
fortune
of
his
family
had
been
drained
by
law
expenses
owing
to
suits
mistakenly
urged
by
her
family
he
spoke
of
his
mother
lonely
life
and
pinched
circumstances
of
her
lack
of
comfort
in
her
elder
son
and
of
the
habit
she
had
consequently
acquired
of
looking
at
the
gloomy
side
of
things
he
hinted
that
she
had
been
accustomed
to
dictate
and
that
as
he
had
left
her
when
he
was
a
boy
she
had
perhaps
indulged
the
dream
that
he
would
come
back
a
boy
she
was
still
sore
on
the
point
of
his
politics
these
things
could
not
be
helped
but
so
far
as
he
could
he
wished
to
make
the
rest
of
her
life
as
cheerful
as
possible
esther
listened
eagerly
and
took
these
things
to
heart
the
claim
to
an
inheritance
the
sudden
discovery
of
a
right
to
a
fortune
held
by
others
was
acquiring
a
very
distinct
and
unexpected
meaning
for
her
every
day
she
was
getting
more
clearly
into
her
imagination
what
it
would
be
to
abandon
her
own
past
and
what
she
would
enter
into
in
exchange
for
it
what
it
would
be
to
disturb
a
long
possession
and
how
difficult
it
was
to
fix
a
point
at
which
the
disturbance
might
begin
so
as
to
be
contemplated
without
pain
harold
transome
thoughts
turned
on
the
same
subject
but
accompanied
by
a
different
state
of
feeling
and
with
more
definite
resolutions
he
saw
a
mode
of
reconciling
all
difficulties
which
looked
pleasanter
to
him
the
longer
he
looked
at
esther
when
she
had
been
hardly
a
week
in
the
house
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
and
it
had
never
entered
into
that
mind
that
the
decision
did
not
rest
entirely
with
his
inclination
it
was
not
that
he
thought
slightly
of
esther
demands
he
saw
that
she
would
require
considerable
attractions
to
please
her
and
that
there
were
difficulties
to
be
overcome
she
was
clearly
a
girl
who
must
be
wooed
but
harold
did
not
despair
of
presenting
the
requisite
attractions
and
the
difficulties
gave
more
interest
to
the
wooing
than
he
could
have
believed
when
he
had
said
that
he
would
not
marry
an
englishwoman
he
had
always
made
a
mental
reservation
in
favor
of
peculiar
circumstances
and
now
the
peculiar
circumstances
were
come
to
be
deeply
in
love
was
a
catastrophe
not
likely
to
happen
to
him
but
he
was
readily
amorous
no
woman
could
make
him
miserable
but
he
was
sensitive
to
the
presence
of
women
and
was
kind
to
them
not
with
grimaces
like
a
man
of
mere
gallantry
but
beamingly
easily
like
a
man
of
genuine
and
each
day
he
was
near
esther
the
solution
of
all
difficulties
by
marriage
became
a
more
pleasing
prospect
though
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
the
difficulties
did
not
diminish
on
a
nearer
view
in
spite
of
the
flattering
sense
that
she
brightened
at
his
approach
harold
was
not
one
to
fail
in
a
purpose
for
want
of
assiduity
after
an
hour
or
two
devoted
to
business
in
the
morning
he
went
to
look
for
esther
and
if
he
did
not
find
her
at
play
with
harry
and
old
transome
or
chatting
with
his
mother
he
went
into
the
where
she
was
usually
either
seated
with
a
book
on
her
knee
and
making
a
bed
for
her
cheek
with
one
little
hand
while
she
looked
out
of
the
window
or
else
standing
in
front
of
one
of
the
family
portraits
with
an
air
of
rumination
esther
found
it
impossible
to
read
in
these
days
her
life
was
a
book
which
she
seemed
herself
to
be
constructing
trying
to
make
character
clear
before
her
and
looking
into
the
ways
of
destiny
the
active
harold
had
almost
always
something
definite
to
propose
by
way
of
filling
the
time
if
it
were
fine
she
must
walk
out
with
him
and
see
the
grounds
and
when
the
snow
melted
and
it
was
no
longer
slippery
she
must
get
on
horseback
and
learn
to
ride
if
they
staid
indoors
she
must
learn
to
play
at
billiards
or
she
must
go
over
the
house
and
see
the
pictures
he
had
had
hung
anew
or
the
costumes
he
had
brought
from
the
east
or
come
into
his
study
and
look
at
the
map
of
the
estate
and
hear
what
if
it
had
remained
in
his
family
he
had
intended
to
do
in
every
corner
of
it
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
its
capabilities
about
a
certain
time
in
the
morning
esther
had
learned
to
expect
him
let
every
wooer
make
himself
strongly
expected
he
may
succeed
by
dint
of
being
absent
but
hardly
in
the
first
instance
one
morning
harold
found
her
in
the
leaning
against
a
and
looking
at
the
portrait
of
a
certain
lady
betty
transome
who
had
lived
a
century
and
a
half
before
and
had
the
usual
charm
of
ladies
in
sir
peter
lely
style
do
move
pray
he
said
on
entering
you
look
as
if
you
were
standing
for
your
own
portrait
i
take
that
as
an
insinuation
said
esther
laughing
and
moving
toward
her
seat
on
an
ottoman
near
the
fire
for
i
notice
almost
all
the
portraits
are
in
a
conscious
affected
attitude
that
fair
lady
betty
looks
as
if
she
had
been
drilled
into
that
posture
and
had
not
will
enough
of
her
own
ever
to
move
again
unless
she
had
a
little
push
given
to
her
she
brightens
up
that
panel
well
with
her
long
satin
skirt
said
harold
as
he
followed
esther
but
alive
i
dare
say
she
would
have
been
less
cheerful
company
one
would
certainly
think
that
she
had
just
been
unpacked
from
silver
paper
ah
how
chivalrous
you
are
said
esther
as
harold
kneeling
on
one
knee
held
her
silken
for
her
to
put
her
foot
through
she
had
often
fancied
pleasant
scenes
in
which
such
homage
was
rendered
to
her
and
the
homage
was
not
disagreeable
now
it
was
really
come
but
strangely
enough
a
little
darting
sensation
at
that
moment
was
accompanied
by
the
vivid
remembrance
of
some
one
who
had
never
paid
the
least
attention
to
her
foot
there
had
been
a
slight
blush
such
as
often
came
and
went
rapidly
and
she
was
silent
a
moment
harold
naturally
believed
that
it
was
he
himself
who
was
filling
the
field
of
vision
he
would
have
liked
to
place
himself
on
the
ottoman
near
esther
and
behave
very
much
more
like
a
lover
but
he
took
a
chair
opposite
to
her
at
a
circumspect
distance
he
dared
not
do
otherwise
along
with
esther
playful
charm
she
conveyed
an
impression
of
personal
pride
and
high
spirit
which
warned
harold
acuteness
that
in
the
delicacy
of
their
present
position
he
might
easily
make
a
false
move
and
offend
her
a
woman
was
likely
to
be
credulous
about
adoration
and
to
find
no
difficulty
in
referring
it
to
her
intrinsic
attractions
but
esther
was
too
dangerously
quick
and
critical
not
to
discern
the
least
awkwardness
that
looked
like
offering
her
marriage
as
a
convenient
compromise
for
himself
beforehand
he
might
have
said
that
such
characteristics
as
hers
were
not
loveable
in
a
woman
but
as
it
was
he
found
that
the
hope
of
pleasing
her
had
a
piquancy
quite
new
to
him
i
wonder
said
esther
breaking
the
silence
in
her
usual
light
silvery
tones
i
wonder
whether
the
women
who
looked
in
that
way
ever
felt
any
troubles
i
see
there
are
two
old
ones
in
the
who
have
only
got
fat
the
expression
of
their
faces
is
just
of
the
same
sort
a
woman
ought
never
to
have
any
trouble
there
should
always
be
a
man
to
guard
her
from
it
harold
transome
was
masculine
and
fallible
he
had
incautiously
sat
down
this
morning
to
pay
his
addresses
by
talk
about
nothing
in
particular
and
clever
experienced
man
as
he
was
he
fell
into
nonsense
but
suppose
the
man
himself
got
into
trouble
you
would
wish
her
to
mind
about
that
or
suppose
added
esther
suddenly
looking
up
merrily
at
harold
the
man
himself
was
troublesome
oh
you
must
not
strain
probabilities
in
that
way
the
generality
of
men
are
perfect
take
me
for
example
you
are
a
perfect
judge
of
sauces
said
esther
who
had
her
triumphs
in
letting
harold
know
that
she
was
capable
of
taking
notes
that
is
perfection
number
one
pray
go
on
oh
the
catalogue
is
too
long
i
should
be
tired
before
i
got
to
your
magnificent
ruby
ring
and
your
gloves
always
of
the
right
color
if
you
would
let
me
tell
you
your
perfections
i
should
not
be
tired
that
is
not
complimentary
it
means
that
the
list
is
short
no
it
means
that
the
list
is
pleasant
to
dwell
upon
pray
do
begin
said
esther
with
her
pretty
toss
of
the
head
it
would
be
dangerous
to
our
good
understanding
the
person
i
liked
best
in
the
world
was
one
who
did
nothing
but
scold
me
and
tell
me
of
my
faults
when
esther
began
to
speak
she
meant
to
do
no
more
than
make
a
remote
unintelligible
allusion
feeling
it
must
be
owned
a
naughty
will
to
flirt
and
be
saucy
and
thwart
harold
attempts
to
be
felicitous
in
compliment
but
she
had
no
sooner
uttered
the
words
than
they
seemed
to
her
like
a
confession
a
deep
flush
spread
itself
over
her
face
and
neck
and
the
sense
that
she
was
blushing
went
on
deepening
her
color
harold
felt
himself
unpleasantly
illuminated
as
to
a
possibility
that
had
never
yet
occurred
to
him
his
surprise
made
an
uncomfortable
pause
in
which
esther
had
time
to
feel
much
vexation
you
speak
in
the
past
tense
said
harold
at
last
yet
i
am
rather
envious
of
that
person
i
shall
never
be
able
to
win
your
regard
in
the
same
way
is
it
anyone
at
treby
because
in
that
case
i
can
enquire
about
your
faults
oh
you
know
i
have
always
lived
among
grave
people
said
esther
more
able
to
recover
herself
now
she
was
spoken
to
before
i
came
home
to
be
with
my
father
i
was
nothing
but
a
first
and
then
a
teacher
in
different
stages
of
growth
people
in
those
circumstances
are
not
usually
flattered
but
there
are
varieties
in
at
our
paris
school
the
master
i
liked
best
was
an
old
man
who
stormed
at
me
terribly
when
i
read
racine
but
yet
showed
that
he
was
proud
of
me
esther
was
getting
quite
cool
again
but
harold
was
not
entirely
satisfied
if
there
was
any
obstacle
in
his
way
he
wished
to
know
exactly
what
it
was
that
must
have
been
a
wretched
life
for
you
at
treby
he
said
a
person
of
your
accomplishments
i
used
to
be
dreadfully
discontented
said
esther
much
occupied
with
mistakes
she
had
made
in
her
netting
but
i
was
becoming
less
so
i
have
had
time
to
get
rather
wise
you
know
i
am
yes
said
harold
rising
and
walking
a
few
paces
backward
and
forward
you
are
past
your
majority
you
are
empress
of
your
own
fortunes
and
more
besides
dear
me
said
esther
letting
her
work
fall
and
leaning
back
against
the
cushions
i
do
think
i
know
very
well
what
to
do
with
my
empire
well
said
harold
pausing
in
front
of
her
leaning
one
arm
on
the
mantelpiece
and
speaking
very
gravely
i
hope
that
in
any
case
since
you
appear
to
have
no
near
relative
who
understands
affairs
you
will
confide
in
me
and
trust
me
with
all
your
intentions
as
if
i
had
no
other
personal
concern
in
the
matter
than
a
regard
for
you
i
hope
you
believe
me
capable
of
acting
as
the
guardian
of
your
interest
even
where
it
turns
out
to
be
inevitably
opposed
to
my
own
i
am
sure
you
have
given
me
reason
to
believe
it
said
esther
with
seriousness
putting
out
her
hand
to
harold
she
had
not
been
left
in
ignorance
that
he
had
had
opportunities
twice
offered
of
stifling
her
claims
harold
raised
the
hand
to
his
lips
but
dared
not
retain
it
more
than
an
instant
still
the
sweet
reliance
in
esther
manner
made
an
irresistible
temptation
to
him
after
standing
still
a
moment
or
two
while
she
bent
over
her
work
he
glided
to
the
ottoman
and
seated
himself
close
by
her
looking
at
her
busy
hands
i
see
you
have
made
mistakes
in
your
work
he
said
bending
still
nearer
for
he
saw
that
she
was
conscious
yet
not
angry
nonsense
you
know
nothing
about
it
said
esther
laughing
and
crushing
up
the
soft
silk
under
her
palms
those
blunders
have
a
design
in
them
she
looked
round
and
saw
a
handsome
face
very
near
her
harold
was
looking
as
he
felt
thoroughly
enamored
of
this
bright
woman
who
was
not
at
all
to
his
preconceived
taste
perhaps
a
touch
of
hypothetic
jealousy
now
helped
to
heighten
the
effect
but
he
mastered
all
indiscretion
and
only
looked
at
her
as
he
said
i
am
wondering
whether
you
have
any
deep
wishes
and
secrets
that
i
ca
guess
pray
do
speak
of
my
wishes
said
esther
quite
overmastered
by
this
new
and
apparently
involuntary
manifestation
in
harold
i
could
not
possibly
tell
you
one
at
this
moment
i
think
i
shall
never
find
them
out
again
oh
yes
she
said
abruptly
struggling
to
relieve
herself
from
the
oppression
of
unintelligible
feelings
i
do
know
one
wish
distinctly
i
want
to
go
and
see
my
father
he
writes
me
word
that
all
is
well
with
him
but
still
i
want
to
see
him
you
shall
be
driven
there
when
you
like
may
i
go
now
i
mean
as
soon
as
it
is
convenient
said
esther
rising
i
will
give
the
order
immediately
if
you
wish
it
said
harold
understanding
that
the
audience
was
broken
up
chapter
xli
he
rates
me
as
the
merchant
does
the
wares
he
will
not
purchase
quality
not
high
lose
its
color
opened
to
the
sun
has
no
aroma
and
in
fine
is
naught
i
barter
not
for
such
commodities
there
is
no
ratio
betwixt
sands
and
gems
is
wicked
judgment
for
the
soul
can
grow
as
embryos
that
live
and
move
but
blindly
burst
from
the
dark
emerge
regenerate
and
lead
a
life
of
vision
and
of
choice
esther
did
not
take
the
carriage
into
malthouse
lane
but
left
it
to
wait
for
her
outside
the
town
and
when
she
entered
the
house
she
put
her
finger
on
her
lip
to
lyddy
and
ran
lightly
she
wished
to
surprise
her
father
by
this
visit
and
she
succeeded
the
little
minister
was
just
then
almost
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
books
with
merely
his
head
peeping
above
them
being
much
embarrassed
to
find
a
substitute
for
tables
and
desks
on
which
to
arrange
the
volumes
he
kept
open
for
reference
he
was
absorbed
in
mastering
all
those
painstaking
interpretations
of
the
book
of
daniel
which
are
by
this
time
well
gone
to
the
limbo
of
mistaken
criticism
and
esther
as
she
opened
the
door
softly
heard
him
rehearsing
aloud
a
passage
in
which
he
declared
with
some
parenthetic
provisoes
that
he
conceived
not
how
a
perverse
ingenuity
could
blunt
the
edge
of
prophetic
explicitness
or
how
an
open
mind
could
fail
to
see
in
the
chronology
of
the
little
horn
the
resplendent
lamp
of
an
inspired
symbol
searching
out
the
germinal
growth
of
an
power
you
will
not
like
me
to
interrupt
you
father
said
esther
slyly
ah
my
beloved
child
he
exclaimed
upsetting
a
pile
of
books
and
thus
unintentionally
making
a
convenient
breach
in
his
wall
through
which
esther
could
get
up
to
him
and
kiss
him
thy
appearing
is
as
a
joy
despaired
of
i
had
thought
of
thee
as
the
blinded
think
of
the
daylight
which
indeed
is
a
thing
to
rejoice
in
like
all
other
good
though
we
see
it
not
nigh
are
you
sure
you
have
been
as
well
and
comfortable
as
you
said
you
were
in
your
letters
said
esther
seating
herself
close
in
front
of
her
father
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
wrote
truly
my
dear
according
to
my
knowledge
at
the
time
but
to
an
old
memory
like
mine
the
present
days
are
but
as
a
little
water
poured
on
the
deep
it
seems
now
that
all
has
been
as
usual
except
my
studies
which
have
gone
somewhat
curiously
into
prophetic
history
but
i
fear
you
will
rebuke
me
for
my
negligent
apparel
said
the
little
man
feeling
in
front
of
esther
brightness
like
a
bat
overtaken
by
the
morning
that
is
lyddy
fault
who
sits
crying
over
her
want
of
christian
assurance
instead
of
brushing
your
clothes
and
putting
out
your
clean
cravat
she
is
always
saying
her
righteousness
is
filthy
rags
and
really
i
do
think
that
is
a
very
strong
expression
for
it
i
sure
it
is
dusty
clothes
and
furniture
nay
my
dear
your
playfulness
glances
too
severely
on
our
faithful
lyddy
doubtless
i
am
myself
deficient
in
that
i
do
not
aid
her
infirm
memory
by
admonition
but
now
tell
me
aught
that
you
have
left
untold
about
yourself
your
heart
has
gone
out
somewhat
toward
this
family
the
old
man
and
the
child
whom
i
had
not
reckoned
of
yes
father
it
is
more
and
more
difficult
to
me
to
see
how
i
can
make
up
my
mind
to
disturb
these
people
at
all
something
should
doubtless
be
devised
to
lighten
the
loss
and
the
change
to
the
aged
father
and
mother
i
would
have
you
in
any
case
seek
to
temper
a
vicissitude
which
is
nevertheless
a
providential
arrangement
not
to
be
wholly
set
aside
do
you
think
father
do
you
feel
assured
that
a
case
of
inheritance
like
this
of
mine
is
a
sort
of
providential
arrangement
that
makes
a
command
i
have
so
held
it
said
lyon
solemnly
in
all
my
meditations
i
have
so
held
it
for
you
have
to
consider
my
dear
that
you
have
been
led
by
a
peculiar
path
and
into
experience
which
is
not
ordinarily
the
lot
of
those
who
are
seated
in
high
places
and
what
i
have
hinted
to
you
already
in
my
letters
on
this
head
i
shall
wish
on
a
future
opportunity
to
enter
into
more
at
large
esther
was
uneasily
silent
on
this
great
question
of
her
lot
she
saw
doubts
and
difficulties
in
which
it
seemed
as
if
her
father
could
not
help
her
there
was
no
illumination
for
her
in
this
theory
of
providential
arrangement
she
said
suddenly
what
she
had
not
thought
of
at
all
suddenly
have
you
been
again
to
see
felix
holt
father
you
have
not
mentioned
him
in
your
letters
i
have
been
since
i
last
wrote
my
dear
and
i
took
his
mother
with
me
who
i
fear
made
the
time
heavy
to
him
with
her
plaints
but
afterward
i
carried
her
away
to
the
house
of
a
brother
minister
at
loamford
and
returned
to
felix
and
then
we
had
much
discourse
did
you
tell
him
of
everything
that
has
happened
i
mean
about
me
about
the
transomes
assuredly
i
told
him
and
he
listened
as
one
astonished
for
he
had
much
to
hear
knowing
naught
of
your
birth
and
that
you
had
any
other
father
than
rufus
lyon
is
a
narrative
i
trust
i
shall
not
be
called
on
to
give
to
others
but
i
was
not
without
satisfaction
in
unfolding
the
truth
to
this
young
man
who
hath
wrought
himself
into
my
affection
strangely
i
would
fain
hope
for
ends
that
will
be
a
visible
good
in
his
less
life
when
mine
shall
be
no
longer
and
you
told
him
how
the
transomes
had
come
and
that
i
was
staying
at
transome
court
yes
i
told
these
things
with
some
particularity
as
is
my
wont
concerning
what
hath
imprinted
itself
on
my
mind
what
did
felix
say
truly
my
dear
nothing
desirable
to
recite
said
lyon
rubbing
his
hand
over
his
brow
dear
father
he
did
say
something
and
you
always
remember
what
people
say
pray
tell
me
i
want
to
know
it
was
a
hasty
remark
and
rather
escaped
him
than
was
consciously
framed
he
said
she
will
marry
transome
that
is
what
transome
means
that
was
all
said
esther
turning
rather
pale
and
biting
her
lip
with
the
determination
that
the
tears
should
not
start
yes
we
did
not
go
further
into
that
branch
of
the
subject
i
apprehend
there
is
no
warrant
for
his
seeming
prognostic
and
i
should
not
be
without
disquiet
if
i
thought
otherwise
for
i
confess
that
in
your
accession
to
this
great
position
and
property
i
contemplate
with
hopeful
satisfaction
your
remaining
attached
to
that
body
of
congregational
dissent
which
as
i
hold
hath
retained
most
of
pure
and
primitive
discipline
your
education
and
peculiar
history
would
thus
be
seen
to
have
coincided
with
a
long
train
of
events
in
making
this
family
property
a
means
of
honoring
and
illustrating
a
purer
form
of
christianity
than
that
which
hath
unhappily
obtained
the
in
this
land
i
speak
my
child
as
you
know
always
in
the
hope
that
you
will
fully
join
our
communion
and
this
dear
wish
of
my
heart
nay
this
urgent
prayer
would
seem
to
be
frustrated
by
your
marriage
with
a
man
of
whom
there
is
at
least
no
visible
indication
that
he
would
unite
himself
to
our
body
if
esther
had
been
less
agitated
she
would
hardly
have
helped
smiling
at
the
picture
her
father
words
suggested
of
harold
transome
joining
the
church
in
malthouse
yard
but
she
was
too
seriously
preoccupied
with
what
felix
had
said
which
hurt
her
in
a
fashion
that
was
highly
significant
first
she
was
very
angry
with
him
for
daring
to
say
positively
whom
she
would
marry
and
secondly
she
was
angry
at
the
implication
that
there
was
from
the
first
a
cool
deliberate
design
in
harold
transome
to
marry
her
esther
said
to
herself
that
she
was
quite
capable
of
discerning
harold
transome
disposition
and
judging
of
his
conduct
she
felt
sure
he
was
generous
and
open
it
did
not
lower
him
in
her
opinion
that
since
circumstances
had
brought
them
together
he
evidently
admired
her
was
in
love
with
her
in
short
desired
to
marry
her
and
she
thought
that
she
discerned
the
delicacy
which
hindered
him
from
being
more
explicit
there
is
no
point
on
which
young
women
are
more
easily
piqued
than
this
of
their
sufficiency
to
judge
the
men
who
make
love
to
them
and
esther
generous
nature
delighted
to
believe
in
generosity
all
these
thoughts
were
making
a
tumult
in
her
mind
while
her
father
was
suggesting
the
radiance
her
lot
might
cast
on
the
cause
of
congregational
dissent
she
heard
what
he
said
and
remembered
it
afterward
but
she
made
no
reply
at
present
and
chose
rather
to
start
up
in
search
of
a
brush
an
action
which
would
seem
to
her
father
quite
a
usual
sequence
with
her
it
served
the
purpose
of
diverting
him
from
a
lengthy
subject
have
you
yet
spoken
with
transome
concerning
holt
my
dear
he
said
as
esther
was
moving
about
the
room
i
hinted
to
him
that
you
would
best
decide
how
assistance
should
be
tendered
to
her
no
father
we
have
not
approached
the
subject
transome
may
have
forgotten
it
and
for
several
reasons
i
would
rather
not
talk
of
this
of
money
matters
to
him
at
present
there
is
money
due
to
me
from
the
lukyns
and
the
pendrells
they
have
paid
it
said
lyon
opening
his
desk
i
have
it
here
ready
to
deliver
to
you
keep
it
father
and
pay
holt
rent
with
it
and
do
anything
else
that
is
wanted
for
her
we
must
consider
everything
temporary
now
said
esther
enveloping
her
father
in
a
towel
and
beginning
to
brush
his
auburn
fringe
of
hair
while
he
shut
his
eyes
in
preparation
for
this
pleasant
passivity
everything
is
uncertain
what
may
become
of
felix
what
may
become
of
us
all
oh
dear
she
went
on
changing
suddenly
to
laughing
merriment
i
am
beginning
to
talk
like
lyddy
i
think
truly
said
lyon
smiling
the
uncertainty
of
things
is
a
text
rather
too
wide
and
obvious
for
fruitful
application
and
to
discourse
of
it
is
as
one
may
say
to
bottle
up
the
air
and
make
a
present
of
it
to
those
who
are
already
standing
out
of
doors
do
you
think
said
esther
in
the
course
of
their
chat
that
the
treby
people
know
at
all
about
the
reasons
of
my
being
at
transome
court
i
have
had
no
sign
thereof
and
indeed
there
is
no
one
as
it
appears
who
could
make
the
story
public
the
man
christian
is
away
in
london
with
debarry
parliament
now
beginning
and
jermyn
would
doubtless
respect
the
confidence
of
the
transomes
i
have
not
seen
him
lately
i
know
nothing
of
his
movements
and
so
far
as
my
own
speech
is
concerned
and
my
strict
command
to
lyddy
i
have
withheld
the
means
of
information
even
as
to
your
having
returned
to
transome
court
in
the
carriage
not
wishing
to
give
any
occasion
to
solicitous
questioning
till
time
hath
somewhat
inured
me
but
it
hath
got
abroad
that
you
are
there
and
is
the
subject
of
conjectures
whereof
i
imagine
the
chief
is
that
you
are
gone
as
companion
to
mistress
transome
for
some
of
our
friends
have
already
hinted
a
rebuke
to
me
that
i
should
permit
your
taking
a
position
so
little
likely
to
further
your
spiritual
welfare
now
father
i
think
i
shall
be
obliged
to
run
away
from
you
not
to
keep
the
carriage
too
long
said
esther
as
she
finished
her
reforms
on
the
minister
toilet
you
look
beautiful
now
and
i
must
give
lyddy
a
little
lecture
before
i
go
yes
my
dear
i
would
not
detain
you
seeing
that
my
duties
demand
me
but
take
with
you
this
treatise
which
i
have
purposely
selected
it
concerns
all
the
main
questions
between
ourselves
and
the
establishment
government
discipline
it
is
seasonable
that
you
should
give
a
nearer
attention
to
these
polemics
lest
you
be
drawn
aside
by
the
fallacious
association
of
a
state
church
with
elevated
rank
esther
chose
to
take
the
volume
submissively
rather
than
to
adopt
the
ungraceful
sincerity
of
saying
that
she
was
unable
at
present
to
give
her
mind
to
the
original
functions
of
a
bishop
or
the
comparative
merit
of
endowments
and
voluntaryism
but
she
did
not
run
her
eyes
over
the
pages
during
her
solitary
drive
to
get
a
foretaste
of
the
argument
for
she
was
entirely
occupied
with
felix
holt
prophecy
that
she
would
marry
harold
transome
chapter
xlii
thou
sayst
it
and
not
i
for
thou
hast
done
the
ugly
deed
that
made
these
ugly
words
sophocles
yea
it
becomes
a
man
to
cherish
memory
where
he
had
delight
for
kindness
is
the
natural
birth
of
kindness
whose
soul
records
not
the
great
debt
of
joy
is
stamped
for
ever
an
ignoble
man
sophocles
it
so
happened
that
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
esther
went
to
see
her
father
jermyn
had
not
yet
heard
of
her
presence
at
transome
court
one
fact
conducing
to
keep
him
in
this
ignorance
was
that
some
days
after
his
critical
interview
with
harold
days
during
which
he
had
been
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
harold
made
up
his
mind
to
sacrifice
the
luxury
of
satisfied
anger
for
the
solid
advantage
of
securing
fortune
and
position
he
was
peremptorily
called
away
by
business
to
the
south
of
england
and
was
obliged
to
inform
harold
by
letter
of
his
absence
he
took
care
also
to
notify
his
return
but
harold
made
no
sign
in
reply
the
days
passed
without
bringing
him
any
gossip
concerning
esther
visit
for
such
gossip
was
almost
confined
to
lyon
congregation
her
church
pupils
miss
louisa
jermyn
among
them
having
been
satisfied
by
her
father
written
statement
that
she
was
gone
on
a
visit
of
uncertain
duration
but
on
this
day
of
call
in
malthouse
yard
the
miss
jermyns
in
their
walk
saw
her
getting
into
the
transomes
carriage
which
they
had
previously
observed
to
be
waiting
and
which
they
now
saw
bowled
along
on
the
road
toward
little
treby
it
followed
that
only
a
few
hours
later
the
news
reached
the
astonished
ears
of
matthew
jermyn
entirely
ignorant
of
those
converging
indications
and
small
links
of
incident
which
had
raised
christian
conjectures
and
had
gradually
contributed
to
put
him
in
possession
of
the
facts
ignorant
too
of
some
busy
motives
in
the
mind
of
his
obliged
servant
johnson
jermyn
was
not
likely
to
see
at
once
how
the
momentous
information
that
esther
was
the
surviving
bycliffe
could
possibly
have
reached
harold
his
daughters
naturally
leaped
as
others
had
done
to
the
conclusion
that
the
transomes
seeking
a
governess
for
little
harry
had
had
their
choice
directed
to
esther
and
observed
that
they
must
have
attracted
her
by
a
high
salary
to
induce
her
to
take
charge
of
such
a
small
pupil
though
of
course
it
was
important
that
his
english
and
french
should
be
carefully
attended
to
from
the
first
jermyn
hearing
this
suggestion
was
not
without
a
momentary
hope
that
it
might
be
true
and
that
harold
was
still
safely
unconscious
of
having
under
the
same
roof
with
him
the
legal
claimant
of
the
family
estate
but
a
mind
in
the
grasp
of
a
terrible
anxiety
is
not
credulous
of
easy
solutions
the
one
stay
that
bears
up
our
hopes
is
sure
to
appear
frail
and
if
looked
at
long
will
seem
to
totter
too
much
depended
on
that
unconsciousness
of
harold
and
although
jermyn
did
not
see
the
course
of
things
that
could
have
disclosed
and
combined
the
various
items
of
knowledge
which
he
had
imagined
to
be
his
own
secret
and
therefore
his
safeguard
he
saw
quite
clearly
what
was
likely
to
be
the
result
of
the
disclosure
not
only
would
harold
transome
be
no
longer
afraid
of
him
but
also
by
marrying
esther
and
jermyn
at
once
felt
sure
of
this
issue
would
be
triumphantly
freed
from
any
unpleasant
consequences
and
could
pursue
much
at
his
ease
the
gratification
of
ruining
matthew
jermyn
the
prevision
of
an
enemy
triumphant
ease
is
in
any
case
sufficiently
irritating
to
hatred
and
there
were
reasons
why
it
was
peculiarly
exasperating
here
but
jermyn
had
not
the
leisure
now
for
mere
fruitless
emotion
he
had
to
think
of
a
possible
device
which
might
save
him
from
imminent
ruin
not
an
indefinite
adversity
but
a
ruin
in
detail
which
his
thoughts
painted
out
with
the
sharpest
ugliest
intensity
a
man
of
sixty
with
an
unsuspicious
wife
and
daughters
capable
of
shrieking
and
fainting
at
a
sudden
revelation
and
of
looking
at
him
reproachfully
in
their
daily
misery
under
a
shabby
lot
to
which
he
had
reduced
them
with
a
mind
and
with
habits
dried
hard
by
the
years
with
no
glimpse
of
an
endurable
except
where
he
could
domineer
and
be
prosperous
according
to
the
ambitions
of
pushing
gentility
such
a
man
is
likely
to
find
the
prospect
of
worldly
ruin
ghastly
enough
to
drive
him
to
the
most
uninviting
means
of
escape
he
will
probably
prefer
any
private
scorn
that
will
save
him
from
public
infamy
or
that
will
leave
him
with
money
in
his
pocket
to
the
humiliation
and
hardship
of
new
servitude
in
old
age
a
shabby
hat
and
a
melancholy
hearth
where
the
firing
must
be
used
charily
and
the
women
look
sad
but
though
a
man
may
be
willing
to
escape
through
a
sewer
a
sewer
with
an
outlet
into
the
dry
air
is
not
always
at
hand
running
away
especially
when
spoken
of
as
absconding
seems
at
a
distance
to
offer
a
good
modern
substitute
for
the
right
of
sanctuary
but
seen
closely
it
is
often
found
inconvenient
and
scarcely
possible
jermyn
on
thoroughly
considering
his
position
saw
that
he
had
no
very
agreeable
resources
at
command
but
he
soon
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
next
he
wrote
to
transome
requesting
her
to
appoint
an
hour
in
which
he
could
see
her
privately
he
knew
she
would
understand
that
it
was
to
be
an
hour
when
harold
was
not
at
home
as
he
sealed
the
letter
he
indulged
a
faint
hope
that
in
this
interview
he
might
be
assured
of
esther
birth
being
unknown
at
transome
court
but
in
the
worst
case
perhaps
some
help
might
be
found
in
transome
to
such
uses
may
tender
relations
come
when
they
have
ceased
to
be
tender
the
hazaels
of
our
world
who
are
pushed
on
quickly
against
their
preconceived
confidence
in
themselves
to
do
doglike
actions
by
the
sudden
suggestion
of
a
wicked
ambition
are
much
fewer
than
those
who
are
led
on
through
the
years
by
the
gradual
demands
of
a
selfishness
which
has
spread
its
fibres
far
and
wide
through
the
intricate
vanities
and
sordid
cares
of
an
everyday
existence
in
consequence
of
that
letter
to
transome
jermyn
was
two
days
afterward
ushered
into
the
smaller
at
transome
court
it
was
a
charming
little
room
in
its
refurbished
condition
it
had
two
pretty
inlaid
cabinets
great
china
vases
with
contents
that
sent
forth
odors
of
paradise
groups
of
flowers
in
oval
frames
on
the
walls
and
transome
own
portrait
in
the
evening
costume
of
with
a
garden
in
the
background
that
brilliant
young
woman
looked
smilingly
down
on
jermyn
as
he
passed
in
front
of
the
fire
and
at
present
hers
was
the
only
gaze
in
the
room
he
could
not
help
meeting
the
gaze
as
he
waited
holding
his
hat
behind
him
could
not
help
seeing
many
memories
lit
up
by
it
but
the
strong
bent
of
his
mind
was
to
go
on
arguing
each
memory
into
a
claim
and
to
see
in
the
regard
others
had
for
him
a
merit
of
his
own
there
had
been
plenty
of
roads
open
to
him
when
he
was
a
young
man
perhaps
if
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
be
determined
chiefly
of
course
by
the
feelings
of
others
for
of
what
effect
would
his
own
feelings
have
been
without
them
into
the
road
he
actually
took
he
might
have
done
better
for
himself
at
any
rate
he
was
likely
at
last
to
get
the
worst
of
it
and
it
was
he
who
had
most
reason
to
complain
the
fortunate
jason
as
we
know
from
euripides
piously
thanked
the
goddess
and
saw
clearly
that
he
was
not
at
all
obliged
to
medea
jermyn
was
perhaps
not
aware
of
the
precedent
but
thought
out
his
own
freedom
from
obligation
and
the
indebtedness
of
others
toward
him
with
a
native
faculty
not
inferior
to
jason
before
three
minutes
had
passed
however
as
if
by
some
sorcery
the
brilliant
smiling
young
woman
above
the
mantelpiece
seemed
to
be
appearing
at
the
doorway
withered
and
frosted
by
many
winters
and
with
lips
and
eyes
from
which
the
smile
had
departed
jermyn
advanced
and
they
shook
hands
but
neither
of
them
said
anything
by
way
of
greeting
transome
seated
herself
and
pointed
to
a
chair
opposite
and
near
her
harold
has
gone
to
loamford
she
said
in
a
subdued
tone
you
had
something
particular
to
say
to
me
yes
said
jermyn
with
his
soft
and
deferential
air
the
last
time
i
was
here
i
could
not
take
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
but
i
am
anxious
to
know
whether
you
are
aware
of
what
has
passed
between
me
and
harold
yes
he
has
told
me
everything
about
his
proceedings
against
me
and
the
reason
he
stopped
them
yes
have
you
had
notice
that
he
has
begun
them
again
no
said
jermyn
with
a
very
unpleasant
sensation
of
course
he
will
now
said
transome
there
is
no
reason
in
his
mind
why
he
should
not
has
he
resolved
to
risk
the
estate
then
he
feels
in
no
danger
on
that
score
and
if
there
were
the
danger
does
depend
on
you
the
most
likely
thing
is
that
he
will
marry
this
girl
he
knows
everything
then
said
jermyn
the
expression
of
his
face
getting
clouded
everything
it
of
no
use
for
you
to
think
of
mastering
him
you
do
it
i
used
to
wish
harold
to
be
fortunate
and
he
is
fortunate
said
transome
with
intense
bitterness
it
not
my
star
that
he
inherits
do
you
know
how
he
came
by
the
information
about
this
girl
no
but
she
knew
it
all
before
we
spoke
to
her
it
no
secret
jermyn
was
confounded
by
this
hopeless
frustration
to
which
he
had
no
key
though
he
thought
of
christian
the
thought
shed
no
light
but
the
more
fatal
point
was
clear
he
held
no
secret
that
could
help
him
you
are
aware
that
these
chancery
proceedings
may
ruin
me
he
told
me
they
would
but
if
you
are
imagining
i
can
do
anything
pray
dismiss
the
notion
i
have
told
him
as
plainly
as
i
dare
that
i
wish
him
to
drop
all
public
quarrel
with
you
and
that
you
could
make
an
arrangement
without
scandal
i
can
do
no
more
he
will
not
listen
to
me
he
does
mind
about
my
feelings
he
cares
more
for
transome
than
he
does
for
me
he
will
not
listen
to
me
any
more
than
if
i
were
an
old
it
very
hard
on
me
i
know
said
jermyn
in
the
tone
with
which
a
man
flings
out
a
reproach
i
besought
you
three
months
ago
to
bear
anything
rather
than
quarrel
with
him
i
have
not
quarrelled
with
him
it
is
he
who
has
been
always
seeking
a
quarrel
with
me
i
have
borne
a
great
deal
more
than
any
one
else
would
he
set
his
teeth
against
me
from
the
first
he
saw
things
that
annoyed
him
and
men
are
not
like
women
said
transome
there
was
bitter
innuendo
in
that
truism
it
very
hard
on
me
i
know
that
said
jermyn
with
an
intensification
of
his
previous
tone
rising
and
walking
a
step
or
two
then
turning
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
of
course
the
law
in
this
case
ca
in
the
least
represent
the
justice
of
the
matter
i
made
a
good
many
sacrifices
in
times
past
i
gave
up
a
great
deal
of
fine
business
for
the
sake
of
attending
to
the
family
affairs
and
in
that
lawsuit
they
would
have
gone
to
rack
and
ruin
if
it
been
for
me
he
moved
away
again
laid
down
his
hat
which
he
had
been
previously
holding
and
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
as
he
returned
transome
sat
motionless
as
marble
and
almost
as
pale
her
hands
lay
crossed
on
her
knees
this
man
young
slim
and
graceful
with
a
selfishness
which
then
took
the
form
of
homage
to
her
had
at
one
time
kneeled
to
her
and
kissed
those
hands
fervently
and
she
had
thought
there
was
a
poetry
in
such
passion
beyond
any
to
be
found
in
everyday
domesticity
i
stretched
my
conscience
a
good
deal
in
that
affair
of
bycliffe
as
you
know
perfectly
well
i
told
you
everything
at
the
time
i
told
you
i
was
very
uneasy
about
those
witnesses
and
about
getting
him
thrown
into
prison
i
know
it
the
blackest
thing
anybody
could
charge
me
with
if
they
knew
my
life
from
beginning
to
end
and
i
should
never
have
done
it
if
i
had
not
been
under
an
infatuation
such
as
makes
a
man
do
anything
what
did
it
signify
to
me
about
the
loss
of
the
lawsuit
i
was
a
young
bachelor
i
had
the
world
before
me
yes
said
transome
in
a
low
tone
it
was
a
pity
you
did
make
another
choice
what
would
have
become
of
you
said
jermyn
carried
along
a
climax
like
other
i
had
to
think
of
you
you
would
not
have
liked
me
to
make
another
choice
then
clearly
said
transome
with
concentrated
bitterness
but
still
quietly
the
greater
mistake
was
mine
egoism
is
usually
stupid
in
a
dialogue
but
jermyn
did
not
make
him
so
stupid
that
he
did
not
feel
the
edge
of
transome
words
they
increased
his
irritation
i
hardly
see
that
he
replied
with
a
slight
laugh
of
scorn
you
had
an
estate
and
a
position
to
save
to
go
no
farther
i
remember
very
well
what
you
said
to
me
clever
lawyer
can
do
anything
if
he
has
the
will
if
it
impossible
he
will
make
it
possible
and
the
property
is
sure
to
be
harold
some
day
he
was
a
baby
then
i
remember
most
things
a
little
too
well
you
had
better
say
at
once
what
is
your
object
in
recalling
them
an
object
that
is
nothing
more
than
justice
with
the
relation
i
stood
in
it
was
not
likely
i
should
think
myself
bound
by
all
the
forms
that
are
made
to
bind
strangers
i
had
often
immense
trouble
to
raise
the
money
necessary
to
pay
off
debts
and
carry
on
the
affairs
and
as
i
said
before
i
had
given
up
other
lines
of
advancement
which
would
have
been
open
to
me
if
i
had
not
stayed
in
this
neighborhood
at
a
critical
time
when
i
was
fresh
to
the
world
anybody
who
knew
the
whole
circumstances
would
say
that
my
being
hunted
and
run
down
on
the
score
of
my
past
transactions
with
regard
to
the
family
affairs
is
an
abominably
unjust
and
unnatural
thing
jermyn
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
at
my
time
of
life
and
with
a
family
about
me
and
after
what
has
passed
i
should
have
thought
there
was
nothing
you
would
care
more
to
prevent
i
do
care
it
makes
me
miserable
that
is
the
extent
of
my
power
to
feel
miserable
no
it
is
not
the
extent
of
your
power
you
could
save
me
if
you
would
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
harold
would
go
on
against
me
if
he
knew
the
whole
truth
jermyn
had
sat
down
before
he
uttered
the
last
words
he
had
lowered
his
voice
slightly
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
thought
that
he
had
prepared
the
way
for
an
understanding
that
a
man
with
so
much
sharpness
with
so
much
suavity
at
command
a
man
who
piqued
himself
on
his
persuasiveness
toward
women
should
behave
just
as
jermyn
did
on
this
occasion
would
be
surprising
but
for
the
constant
experience
that
temper
and
selfish
insensibility
will
defeat
excellent
gifts
will
make
a
sensible
person
shout
when
shouting
is
out
of
place
and
will
make
a
polished
man
rude
when
his
polish
might
be
of
eminent
use
to
him
as
jermyn
sitting
down
and
leaning
forward
with
an
elbow
on
his
knee
uttered
his
last
words
if
he
knew
the
whole
truth
a
slight
shock
seemed
to
pass
through
transome
hitherto
motionless
body
followed
by
a
sudden
light
in
her
eyes
as
in
an
animal
about
to
spring
and
you
expect
me
to
tell
him
she
said
not
loudly
but
yet
with
a
clear
metallic
ring
in
her
voice
would
it
not
be
right
for
him
to
know
said
jermyn
in
a
more
bland
and
persuasive
tone
than
he
had
yet
used
perhaps
some
of
the
most
terrible
irony
of
the
human
lot
is
this
of
a
deep
truth
coming
to
be
uttered
by
lips
that
have
no
right
to
it
i
will
never
tell
him
said
transome
starting
up
her
whole
frame
thrilled
with
a
passion
that
seemed
almost
to
make
her
young
again
her
hands
hung
beside
her
clenched
tightly
her
eyes
and
lips
lost
the
helpless
repressed
bitterness
of
discontent
and
seemed
suddenly
fed
with
energy
you
reckon
up
your
sacrifices
for
me
you
have
kept
a
good
account
of
them
and
it
is
needful
they
are
some
of
them
what
no
one
else
could
guess
or
find
out
but
you
made
your
sacrifices
when
they
seemed
pleasant
to
you
when
you
told
me
they
were
your
happiness
when
you
told
me
that
it
was
i
who
stooped
and
i
who
bestowed
favors
jermyn
rose
too
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
he
had
grown
visibly
paler
but
seemed
about
to
speak
do
speak
transome
said
peremptorily
do
open
your
lips
again
you
have
said
enough
i
will
speak
now
i
have
made
sacrifices
too
but
it
was
when
i
knew
that
they
were
not
my
happiness
it
was
after
i
saw
that
i
had
stooped
after
i
saw
that
your
tenderness
had
turned
into
calculation
after
i
saw
that
you
cared
for
yourself
only
and
not
for
me
i
heard
your
explanations
of
your
duty
in
life
of
our
mutual
reputation
of
a
virtuous
young
lady
attached
to
you
i
bore
it
i
let
everything
go
i
shut
my
eyes
i
might
almost
have
let
myself
starve
rather
than
have
scenes
of
quarrel
with
the
man
i
had
loved
in
which
i
must
accuse
him
of
turning
my
love
into
a
good
bargain
there
was
a
slight
tremor
in
transome
voice
in
the
last
words
and
for
a
moment
she
paused
but
when
she
spoke
again
it
seemed
as
if
the
tremor
had
frozen
into
a
cutting
icicle
i
suppose
if
a
lover
picked
pocket
there
no
woman
would
like
to
own
it
i
do
say
i
was
not
afraid
of
you
i
was
afraid
of
you
and
i
know
now
i
was
right
transome
said
jermyn
white
to
the
lips
it
is
needless
to
say
more
i
withdraw
any
words
that
have
offended
you
you
ca
withdraw
them
can
a
man
apologize
for
being
a
dastard
and
i
have
caused
you
to
strain
your
conscience
have
i
it
is
i
who
have
sullied
your
purity
i
should
think
the
demons
have
more
honor
they
are
not
so
impudent
to
one
another
i
would
not
lose
the
misery
of
being
a
woman
now
i
see
what
can
be
the
baseness
of
a
man
one
must
be
a
man
first
to
tell
a
woman
that
her
love
has
made
her
your
debtor
and
then
ask
her
to
pay
you
by
breaking
the
last
poor
threads
between
her
and
her
son
i
do
not
ask
it
said
jermyn
with
a
certain
asperity
he
was
beginning
to
find
this
intolerable
the
mere
brute
strength
of
a
masculine
creature
rebelled
he
felt
almost
inclined
to
throttle
the
voice
out
of
this
woman
you
do
ask
it
it
is
what
you
would
like
i
have
had
a
terror
on
me
lest
evil
should
happen
to
you
from
the
first
after
harold
came
home
i
had
a
terrible
dread
it
seemed
as
if
murder
might
come
between
you
i
did
know
what
i
felt
the
horror
of
his
not
knowing
the
truth
i
might
have
been
dragged
at
last
by
my
own
feeling
by
my
own
memory
to
tell
him
all
and
make
him
as
well
as
myself
miserable
to
save
you
again
there
was
a
slight
tremor
as
if
at
the
remembrance
of
womanly
tenderness
and
pity
but
immediately
she
launched
forth
again
but
now
you
have
asked
me
i
will
never
tell
him
be
ruined
no
do
something
more
dastardly
to
save
yourself
if
i
sinned
my
judgment
went
beforehand
that
i
should
sin
for
a
man
like
you
swiftly
upon
those
last
words
transome
passed
out
of
the
room
the
softly
padded
door
closed
behind
her
making
no
noise
and
jermyn
found
himself
alone
for
a
brief
space
he
stood
still
human
beings
in
moments
of
passionate
reproach
and
denunciation
especially
when
their
anger
is
on
their
own
account
are
never
so
wholly
in
the
right
that
the
person
who
has
to
wince
can
not
possibly
protest
against
some
unreasonableness
or
unfairness
in
their
outburst
and
if
jermyn
had
been
capable
of
feeling
that
he
had
thoroughly
merited
this
infliction
he
would
not
have
uttered
the
words
that
drew
it
down
on
him
men
do
not
become
penitent
and
learn
to
abhor
themselves
by
having
their
backs
cut
open
with
the
lash
rather
they
learn
to
abhor
the
lash
what
jermyn
felt
about
transome
when
she
disappeared
was
that
she
was
a
furious
woman
who
would
not
do
what
he
wanted
her
to
do
and
he
was
supported
as
to
his
justifiableness
by
the
inward
repetition
of
what
he
had
already
said
to
her
it
was
right
that
harold
should
know
the
truth
he
did
not
take
into
account
how
should
he
the
exasperation
and
loathing
excited
by
his
daring
to
urge
the
plea
of
right
a
man
who
had
stolen
the
pyx
and
got
frightened
when
justice
was
at
his
heels
might
feel
the
sort
of
penitence
which
would
induce
him
to
run
back
in
the
dark
and
lay
the
pyx
where
the
sexton
might
find
it
but
if
in
doing
so
he
whispered
to
the
blessed
virgin
that
he
was
moved
by
considering
the
sacredness
of
all
property
and
the
peculiar
sacredness
of
the
pyx
it
is
not
to
be
believed
that
she
would
like
him
the
better
for
it
indeed
one
often
seems
to
see
why
the
saints
should
prefer
candles
to
words
especially
from
penitents
whose
skin
is
in
danger
some
salt
of
generosity
would
have
made
jermyn
conscious
that
he
had
lost
the
citizenship
which
authorized
him
to
plead
the
right
still
more
that
his
to
transome
would
be
like
the
exhibition
of
a
and
only
show
that
he
was
there
is
heroism
even
in
the
circles
of
hell
for
who
cling
to
each
other
in
the
fiery
whirlwind
and
never
recriminate
but
these
things
which
are
easy
to
discern
when
they
are
painted
for
us
on
the
large
canvas
of
poetic
story
become
confused
and
obscure
even
for
gentlemen
when
their
affection
for
themselves
is
alarmed
by
pressing
details
of
actual
experience
if
their
comparison
of
instances
is
active
at
such
times
it
is
chiefly
in
showing
them
that
their
own
case
has
subtle
distinctions
from
all
other
cases
which
should
free
them
from
unmitigated
condemnation
and
it
was
in
this
way
with
matthew
jermyn
so
many
things
were
more
distinctly
visible
to
him
and
touched
him
more
acutely
than
the
effect
of
his
acts
or
words
on
transome
feelings
in
fact
he
asked
with
a
touch
of
something
that
makes
us
all
akin
was
it
not
preposterous
this
excess
of
feeling
on
points
which
he
himself
did
not
find
powerfully
moving
she
had
treated
him
most
unreasonably
it
would
have
been
right
for
her
to
do
what
he
had
not
asked
but
only
hinted
at
in
a
mild
and
interrogatory
manner
but
the
clearest
and
most
unpleasant
result
of
the
interview
was
that
this
right
thing
which
he
desired
so
much
would
certainly
not
be
done
for
him
by
transome
as
he
was
moving
his
arm
from
the
and
turning
to
take
his
hat
there
was
a
boisterous
noise
in
the
the
door
of
the
which
had
closed
without
latching
was
pushed
open
and
old
transome
appeared
with
a
face
of
feeble
delight
playing
horse
to
little
harry
who
roared
and
flogged
behind
him
while
moro
yapped
in
a
puppy
voice
at
their
heels
but
when
transome
saw
jermyn
in
the
room
he
stood
still
in
the
doorway
as
if
he
did
not
know
whether
entrance
was
permissible
the
majority
of
his
thoughts
were
but
ravelled
threads
of
the
past
the
attorney
came
forward
to
shake
hands
with
due
politeness
but
the
old
man
said
with
a
bewildered
look
and
in
a
hesitating
way
mr
jermyn
why
why
where
is
mrs
transome
jermyn
smiled
his
way
out
past
the
unexpected
group
and
little
harry
thinking
he
had
an
eligible
opportunity
turned
round
to
give
a
parting
stroke
on
the
stranger
chapter
xliii
whichever
way
my
days
decline
i
felt
and
feel
though
left
alone
his
being
working
in
mine
own
the
footsteps
of
his
life
in
mine
dear
friend
far
off
my
lost
desire
so
far
so
near
in
woe
and
weal
oh
loved
the
most
when
most
i
feel
there
is
a
lower
and
a
higher
tennyson
after
that
morning
on
which
esther
found
herself
reddened
and
confused
by
the
sense
of
having
made
a
distant
allusion
to
felix
holt
she
felt
it
impossible
that
she
should
even
as
she
had
sometimes
intended
speak
of
him
explicitly
to
harold
in
order
to
discuss
probabilities
as
to
the
issue
of
his
trial
she
was
certain
she
could
not
do
it
without
betraying
emotion
and
there
were
very
complex
reasons
in
esther
mind
why
she
could
not
bear
that
harold
should
detect
her
sensibility
on
this
subject
it
was
not
only
all
the
fibres
of
maidenly
pride
and
reserve
of
a
bashfulness
undefinably
peculiar
toward
this
man
who
while
much
older
than
herself
and
bearing
the
stamp
of
an
experience
quite
hidden
from
her
imagination
was
taking
strongly
the
aspect
of
a
lover
it
was
not
only
this
exquisite
kind
of
shame
which
was
at
work
within
her
there
was
another
sort
of
susceptibility
in
esther
which
her
present
circumstances
tended
to
encourage
though
she
had
come
to
regard
it
as
not
at
all
lofty
but
rather
as
something
which
condemned
her
to
littleness
in
comparison
with
a
mind
she
had
learned
to
venerate
she
knew
quite
well
that
to
harold
transome
felix
holt
was
one
of
the
common
people
who
could
come
into
question
in
no
other
than
a
public
light
she
had
a
native
capability
for
discerning
that
the
sense
of
ranks
and
degrees
has
its
repulsions
corresponding
to
the
repulsions
dependent
on
difference
of
race
and
color
and
she
remembered
her
own
impressions
too
well
not
to
foresee
that
it
would
come
on
harold
transome
as
a
shock
if
he
suspected
there
had
been
any
between
her
and
this
young
man
who
to
him
was
of
course
no
more
than
any
other
intelligent
member
of
the
working
class
to
him
said
esther
to
herself
with
a
reaction
of
her
newer
better
pride
who
has
not
had
the
sort
of
intercourse
in
which
felix
holt
cultured
nature
would
have
asserted
its
superiority
and
in
her
fluctuations
on
this
matter
she
found
herself
mentally
protesting
that
whatever
harold
might
think
there
was
a
light
in
which
he
was
vulgar
compared
with
felix
felix
had
ideas
and
motives
which
she
did
not
believe
harold
could
understand
more
than
all
there
was
this
test
she
herself
had
no
sense
of
inferiority
and
just
subjection
when
she
was
with
harold
transome
there
were
even
points
in
him
for
which
she
felt
a
touch
not
of
anger
but
of
playful
scorn
whereas
with
felix
she
had
always
a
sense
of
dependence
and
possible
illumination
in
those
large
grave
candid
gray
eyes
of
his
love
seemed
something
that
belonged
to
the
high
enthusiasm
of
life
such
as
now
might
be
forever
shut
out
from
her
all
the
same
her
vanity
winced
at
the
idea
that
harold
should
discern
what
from
his
point
of
view
would
seem
like
a
degradation
of
her
taste
and
refinement
she
could
not
help
being
gratified
by
all
the
manifestations
from
those
around
her
that
she
was
thought
thoroughly
fitted
for
a
high
position
could
not
help
enjoying
with
more
or
less
keenness
a
rehearsal
of
that
demeanor
amongst
luxuries
and
dignities
which
had
often
been
a
part
of
her
and
the
rehearsal
included
the
reception
of
more
and
more
emphatic
attentions
from
harold
and
of
an
effusiveness
in
his
manners
which
in
proportion
as
it
would
have
been
offensive
if
it
had
appeared
earlier
became
flattering
as
the
effect
of
a
growing
acquaintance
and
daily
contact
it
comes
in
so
many
forms
in
this
life
of
ours
the
knowledge
that
there
is
something
sweetest
and
noblest
of
which
we
despair
and
the
sense
of
something
present
that
solicits
us
with
an
immediate
and
easy
indulgence
and
there
is
a
pernicious
falsity
in
the
pretence
that
a
woman
love
lies
above
the
range
of
such
temptations
day
after
day
esther
had
an
arm
offered
her
had
very
beaming
looks
upon
her
had
opportunities
for
a
great
deal
of
light
airy
talk
in
which
she
knew
herself
to
be
charming
and
had
the
attractive
interest
of
noticing
harold
practical
cleverness
the
masculine
ease
with
which
he
governed
everybody
and
administered
everything
about
him
without
the
least
harshness
and
with
a
facile
which
yet
was
not
weak
in
the
background
too
there
was
the
consideration
that
if
harold
transome
wished
to
marry
her
and
she
accepted
him
the
problem
of
her
lot
would
be
more
easily
solved
than
in
any
other
way
it
was
difficult
by
any
theory
of
providence
or
consideration
of
results
to
see
a
course
which
she
could
call
duty
if
something
would
come
and
urge
itself
strongly
as
pleasure
and
save
her
from
the
effort
to
find
a
clue
of
principle
amid
the
labyrinthine
confusions
of
right
and
possession
the
promise
could
not
but
seem
alluring
and
yet
this
life
at
transome
court
was
the
life
of
her
there
was
dullness
already
in
its
ease
and
in
the
absence
of
high
demand
and
there
was
a
vague
consciousness
that
the
love
of
this
not
unfascinating
man
who
hovered
about
her
gave
an
air
of
moral
mediocrity
to
all
her
prospects
she
would
not
have
been
able
perhaps
to
define
this
impression
but
somehow
or
other
by
this
elevation
of
fortune
it
seemed
that
the
higher
ambition
which
had
begun
to
spring
in
her
was
forever
nullified
all
life
seemed
cheapened
as
it
might
seem
to
a
young
student
who
having
believed
that
to
gain
a
certain
degree
he
must
write
a
thesis
in
which
he
would
bring
his
powers
to
bear
with
memorable
effect
suddenly
ascertained
that
no
thesis
was
expected
but
the
sum
in
english
money
of
pounds
ten
shillings
and
sixpence
after
all
she
was
a
woman
and
could
not
make
her
own
lot
as
she
had
once
said
to
felix
a
woman
must
choose
meaner
things
because
only
meaner
things
are
offered
to
her
her
lot
is
made
for
her
by
the
love
she
accepts
and
esther
began
to
think
that
her
lot
was
being
made
for
her
by
the
love
that
was
surrounding
her
with
the
influence
of
a
garden
on
a
summer
morning
harold
on
his
side
was
conscious
that
the
interest
of
his
wooing
was
not
standing
still
he
was
beginning
to
think
it
a
conquest
in
which
it
would
be
disappointing
to
fail
even
if
this
fair
nymph
had
no
claim
to
the
estate
he
would
have
liked
and
yet
he
would
not
have
liked
that
just
a
slight
shadow
of
doubt
as
to
his
success
should
be
removed
there
was
something
about
esther
that
he
did
not
altogether
understand
she
was
clearly
a
woman
that
could
be
governed
she
was
too
charming
for
him
to
fear
that
she
would
ever
be
obstinate
or
interfering
yet
there
was
a
lightning
that
shot
out
of
her
now
and
then
which
seemed
the
sign
of
a
dangerous
judgment
as
if
she
inwardly
saw
something
more
admirable
than
harold
transome
now
to
be
perfectly
charming
a
woman
should
not
see
this
one
fine
february
day
when
already
the
golden
and
purple
crocuses
were
out
on
the
terrace
one
of
those
flattering
days
which
sometimes
precede
the
winds
of
march
and
make
believe
that
the
coming
spring
will
be
enjoyable
a
very
striking
group
of
whom
esther
and
harold
made
a
part
came
out
at
midday
to
walk
upon
the
gravel
at
transome
court
they
did
not
as
usual
go
toward
the
pleasure
grounds
on
the
eastern
side
because
lingon
who
was
one
of
them
was
going
home
and
his
road
lay
through
the
stone
gateway
into
the
park
uncle
lingon
who
disliked
painful
confidences
and
preferred
knowing
no
mischief
of
anybody
had
not
objected
to
be
let
into
the
important
secret
about
esther
and
was
sure
at
once
that
the
whole
affair
instead
of
being
a
misfortune
was
a
piece
of
excellent
luck
for
himself
he
did
not
profess
to
be
a
judge
of
women
but
she
seemed
to
have
all
the
points
and
to
carry
herself
as
well
as
arabella
did
which
was
saying
a
good
deal
honest
jack
lingon
first
impressions
quickly
became
traditions
which
no
subsequent
evidence
could
disturb
he
was
fond
of
his
sister
and
seemed
never
to
be
conscious
of
any
change
for
the
worse
in
her
since
their
early
time
he
considered
that
man
a
beast
who
said
anything
unpleasant
about
the
persons
to
whom
he
was
attached
it
was
not
that
he
winked
his
eyes
saw
nothing
but
what
his
easy
disposition
inclined
him
to
see
harold
was
a
good
fellow
a
clever
chap
and
esther
peculiar
fitness
for
him
under
all
the
circumstances
was
extraordinary
it
reminded
him
of
something
in
the
classics
though
he
could
think
exactly
what
in
fact
a
memory
was
a
nasty
uneasy
thing
esther
was
always
glad
when
the
old
rector
came
with
an
odd
contrariety
to
her
former
niceties
she
liked
his
rough
attire
and
careless
frank
speech
they
were
something
not
point
device
that
seemed
to
connect
the
life
of
transome
court
with
that
rougher
commoner
world
where
her
home
had
been
she
and
harold
were
walking
a
little
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
the
party
who
were
retarded
by
various
causes
old

wrapped
in
a
cloth
cloak
trimmed
with
sable
and
with
a
soft
warm
cap
also
trimmed
with

head
had
a
shuffling
uncertain
walk
little
harry
was
dragging
a
toy
vehicle
on
the
seat
of
which
he
had
insisted
on
tying
moro
with
a
piece
of
scarlet
drapery
round
him
making
him
look
like
a
barbaric
prince
in
a
chariot
moro
having
little
imagination
objected
to
this
and
barked
with
feeble
snappishness
as
the
tyrannous
lad
ran
forward
then
whirled
the
chariot
round
and
ran
back
to
gappa
then
came
to
a
dead
stop
which
overset
the
chariot
that
he
might
watch
uncle
lingon
run
for
the
hurled
stick
and
bring
it
in
his
mouth

close
to

glancing
with
much
indifference
at

youthful
ardor
about

had
gone
through
all
that

by
looking
on
blandly
and
taking
care
both
of
young
and
old

esther
lyon
and
harold
transome
looking
back
and
seeing
that
they
were
a
good
deal
in
advance
of
the
rest
esther
and
harold
paused
what
do
you
think
about
thinning
the
trees
over
there
said
harold
pointing
with
his
stick
i
have
a
bit
of
a
notion
that
if
they
were
divided
into
clumps
so
as
to
show
the
oaks
beyond
it
would
be
a
great
improvement
it
would
give
an
idea
of
extent
that
is
lost
now
and
there
might
be
some
very
pretty
clumps
got
out
of
those
mixed
trees
what
do
you
think
i
should
think
it
would
be
an
improvement
one
likes
a
everywhere
but
i
never
heard
you
express
yourself
so
dubiously
said
esther
looking
at
him
rather
archly
you
generally
see
things
so
clearly
and
are
so
convinced
that
i
shall
begin
to
feel
quite
tottering
if
i
find
you
in
uncertainty
pray
do
begin
to
be
doubtful
it
is
infectious
you
think
me
a
great
deal
too
sure
too
confident
said
harold
not
at
all
it
is
an
immense
advantage
to
know
your
own
will
when
you
always
mean
to
have
it
but
suppose
i
could
get
it
in
spite
of
meaning
said
harold
with
a
beaming
inquiry
in
his
eyes
oh
then
said
esther
turning
her
head
aside
carelessly
as
if
she
were
considering
the
distant
you
would
bear
it
quite
easily
as
you
did
your
not
getting
into
parliament
you
would
know
you
could
get
it
another
time
or
get
something
else
as
good
the
fact
is
said
harold
moving
on
a
little
as
if
he
did
not
want
to
be
quite
overtaken
by
the
others
you
consider
me
a
fat
fatuous
fellow
oh
there
are
degrees
said
esther
with
a
silvery
laugh
you
have
just
as
much
of
those
qualities
as
is
becoming
there
are
different
styles
you
are
perfect
in
your
own
but
you
prefer
another
style
i
suspect
a
more
submissive
tearful
devout
worshipper
who
would
offer
his
incense
with
more
trembling
you
are
quite
mistaken
said
esther
still
lightly
i
find
i
am
very
wayward
when
anything
is
offered
to
me
it
seems
that
i
prize
it
less
and
do
want
to
have
it
here
was
a
very
baulking
answer
but
in
spite
of
it
harold
could
not
help
believing
that
esther
was
very
far
from
objecting
to
the
sort
of
incense
he
had
been
offering
just
then
i
have
often
read
that
that
is
in
human
nature
she
went
on
yet
it
takes
me
by
surprise
in
myself
i
suppose
she
added
smiling
i
did
think
of
myself
as
human
nature
i
do
confess
to
the
same
waywardness
said
harold
i
am
very
fond
of
things
that
i
can
get
and
i
never
longed
much
for
anything
out
of
my
reach
whatever
i
feel
sure
of
getting
i
like
all
the
better
i
think
half
those
priggish
maxims
about
human
nature
in
the
lump
are
no
more
to
be
relied
on
than
universal
remedies
there
are
different
sorts
of
human
nature
some
are
given
to
discontent
and
longing
others
to
securing
and
enjoying
and
let
me
tell
you
the
discontented
longing
style
is
unpleasant
to
live
with
harold
nodded
with
a
meaning
smile
at
esther
oh
i
assure
you
i
have
abjured
all
admiration
for
it
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
in
return
she
was
remembering
the
schooling
felix
had
given
her
about
her
byronic
heroes
and
was
inwardly
adding
a
third
sort
of
human
nature
to
those
varieties
which
harold
had
mentioned
he
naturally
supposed
that
he
might
take
the
abjuration
to
be
entirely
in
his
own
favor
and
his
face
did
look
very
pleasant
she
could
not
help
liking
him
although
he
was
certainly
too
particular
about
sauces
gravies
and
wines
and
had
a
way
of
virtually
measuring
the
value
of
everything
by
the
contribution
it
made
to
his
own
pleasure
his
very
was
unsympathetic
it
never
came
from
any
thorough
understanding
or
deep
respect
for
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
person
he
obliged
or
indulged
it
was
like
his
kindness
to
his
mother
an
arrangement
of
his
for
the
happiness
of
others
which
if
they
were
sensible
ought
to
succeed
and
an
inevitable
comparison
which
haunted
her
showed
her
the
same
quality
in
his
political
views
the
utmost
enjoyment
of
his
own
advantages
was
the
solvent
that
blended
pride
in
his
family
and
position
with
the
adhesion
to
changes
that
were
to
obliterate
tradition
and
melt
down
enchased
gold
heirlooms
into
plating
for
the
of
the
people
it
is
terrible
the
keen
bright
eye
of
a
woman
when
it
has
once
been
turned
with
admiration
on
what
is
severely
true
but
then
the
severely
true
rarely
comes
within
its
range
of
vision
esther
had
had
an
unusual
illumination
harold
did
not
know
how
but
he
discerned
enough
of
the
effect
to
make
him
more
cautious
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
before
that
caution
would
have
prevented
him
just
then
from
following
up
the
question
as
to
the
style
of
person
esther
would
think
pleasant
to
live
with
even
if
uncle
lingon
had
not
joined
them
as
he
did
to
talk
about
soughing
tiles
saying
presently
that
he
should
turn
across
the
grass
and
get
on
to
the
home
farm
to
have
a
look
at
the
improvements
that
harold
was
making
with
such
racing
speed
but
you
know
lad
said
the
rector
as
they
paused
at
the
expected
parting
you
ca
do
everything
in
a
hurry
the
wheat
must
have
time
to
grow
even
when
you
reformed
all
us
old
tories
off
the
face
of
the
ground
dash
it
now
the
election
over
i
an
old
tory
again
you
see
harold
a
radical
wo
do
for
the
county
at
another
election
you
must
be
on
the
for
a
borough
where
they
want
a
bit
of
blood
i
should
have
liked
you
uncommonly
to
stand
for
the
county
and
a
radical
of
good
family
squares
well
enough
with
a
tory
like
young
debarry
but
you
see
these
riots
it
been
a
nasty
business
i
shall
have
my
hair
combed
at
the
sessions
for
a
year
to
come
but
heyday
what
dame
is
this
with
a
small
boy
not
one
of
my
parishioners
harold
and
esther
turned
and
saw
an
elderly
woman
advancing
with
a
tiny
boy
scantily
attired
as
to
his
jacket
which
merged
into
a
small
a
little
higher
than
his
waist
but
muffled
as
to
his
throat
with
a
blue
woollen
comforter
esther
recognized
the
pair
too
well
and
felt
very
uncomfortable
we
are
so
pitiably
in
subjection
to
all
sorts
of
vanity
even
the
very
vanities
we
are
practically
renouncing
and
in
spite
of
the
almost
solemn
memories
connected
with
holt
esther
first
shudder
was
raised
by
the
idea
of
what
things
this
woman
would
say
and
by
the
mortification
of
having
felix
in
any
way
represented
by
his
mother
as
holt
advanced
into
closer
observation
it
became
more
evident
that
she
was
attired
with
a
view
not
to
charm
the
eye
but
rather
to
afflict
it
with
all
that
expression
of
woe
which
belongs
to
very
rusty
bombazine
and
the
limpest
state
of
false
hair
still
she
was
not
a
woman
to
lose
the
sense
of
her
own
value
or
become
abject
in
her
manners
under
any
circumstances
of
depression
and
she
had
a
peculiar
sense
on
the
present
occasion
that
she
was
justly
relying
on
the
force
of
her
own
character
and
judgment
in
independence
of
anything
that
lyon
or
the
masterful
felix
would
have
said
if
she
had
thought
them
worthy
to
know
of
her
undertaking
she
courtesied
once
as
if
to
the
entire
group
now
including
even
the
dogs
who
showed
various
degrees
of
curiosity
especially
as
to
what
kind
of
game
the
smaller
animal
job
might
prove
to
be
after
due
investigation
and
then
she
proceeded
at
once
toward
esther
who
in
spite
of
her
annoyance
took
her
arm
from
harold
said
how
do
you
do
mrs
holt
very
kindly
and
stooped
to
pat
little
job
yes
you
know
him
miss
lyon
said
holt
in
that
tone
which
implies
that
the
conversation
is
intended
for
the
edification
of
the
company
generally
you
know
the
orphin
child
as
felix
brought
home
for
me
that
am
his
mother
to
take
care
of
and
it
what
i
done
nobody
more
so
though
it
trouble
is
my
reward
esther
had
raised
herself
again
to
stand
in
helpless
endurance
of
whatever
might
be
coming
but
by
this
time
young
harry
struck
even
more
than
the
dogs
by
the
appearance
of
job
tudge
had
come
round
dragging
his
chariot
and
placed
himself
close
to
the
pale
child
whom
he
exceeded
in
height
and
breadth
as
well
as
in
depth
of
coloring
he
looked
into
job
eyes
peeped
round
at
the
tail
of
his
jacket
and
pulled
it
a
little
and
then
taking
off
the
tiny
observed
with
much
interest
the
tight
red
curls
which
had
been
hidden
underneath
it
job
looked
at
his
inspector
with
the
round
blue
eyes
of
astonishment
until
harry
purely
by
way
of
experiment
took
a
from
a
fantastic
wallet
which
hung
over
his
shoulder
and
applied
the
test
to
job
lips
the
result
was
satisfactory
to
both
every
one
had
been
watching
this
small
comedy
and
when
job
crunched
the
while
harry
looked
down
at
him
inquiringly
and
patted
his
back
there
was
general
laughter
except
on
the
part
of
holt
who
was
shaking
her
head
slowly
and
slapping
the
back
of
her
left
hand
with
the
painful
patience
of
a
tragedian
whose
part
is
in
abeyance
to
an
introduction
of
the
humorous
i
hope
job
cough
has
been
better
lately
said
esther
in
mere
uncertainty
as
to
what
it
would
be
desirable
to
say
or
do
i
dare
say
you
hope
so
miss
lyon
said
holt
looking
at
the
distant
landscape
i
no
reason
to
disbelieve
but
what
you
wish
well
to
the
child
and
to
felix
and
to
me
i
sure
nobody
has
any
occasion
to
wish
me
otherways
my
character
will
bear
enquiry
and
what
you
as
are
young
do
know
others
can
tell
you
that
was
what
i
said
to
myself
when
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
here
and
see
you
and
ask
you
to
get
me
the
freedom
to
speak
to
transome
i
said
whatever
miss
lyon
may
be
now
in
the
way
of
being
lifted
up
among
great
people
she
our
minister
daughter
and
was
not
above
coming
to
my
house
and
walking
with
my
son
felix
though
i
not
deny
he
made
that
figure
on
the
lord
day
that
perhaps
go
against
him
with
the
judge
if
anybody
thinks
well
to
tell
him
here
holt
paused
a
moment
as
with
a
mind
arrested
by
the
painful
image
it
had
called
up
esther
face
was
glowing
when
harold
glanced
at
her
and
seeing
this
he
was
considerate
enough
to
address
holt
instead
of
her
you
are
then
the
mother
of
the
unfortunate
young
man
who
is
in
prison
indeed
i
am
sir
said
holt
feeling
that
she
was
now
in
deep
water
it
not
likely
i
should
claim
him
if
he
was
my
own
though
it
not
by
my
will
nor
my
advice
sir
that
he
ever
walked
for
i
gave
him
none
but
good
but
if
everybody
son
was
guided
by
their
mothers
the
world
be
different
my
son
is
not
worse
than
many
another
woman
son
and
that
in
treby
whatever
they
may
say
as
have
got
their
sons
in
prison
and
as
to
his
giving
up
the
doctoring
and
then
stopping
his
father
medicines
i
know
it
bad
that
i
know
but
me
has
had
to
suffer
and
it
me
a
king
and
parliament
consider
if
they
meant
to
do
the
right
thing
and
had
anybody
to
make
it
known
to
and
as
for
the
rioting
and
killing
the
constable
my
son
said
most
plain
to
me
he
never
meant
it
and
there
was
his
bit
of
for
dinner
getting
dry
by
the
fire
the
whole
blessed
time
as
i
sat
and
never
knew
what
was
coming
on
me
and
it
my
opinion
as
if
great
people
make
elections
to
get
themselves
into
parliament
and
there
riot
and
murder
to
do
it
they
ought
to
see
as
the
widow
and
the
widow
son
does
suffer
for
it
i
well
know
my
duty
and
i
read
my
bible
and
i
know
in
jude
where
it
been
stained
with
the
dried
this
many
a
year
as
you
told
not
to
rail
at
your
betters
if
they
was
the
devil
himself
nor
will
i
but
this
i
do
say
if
it
three
transomes
instead
of
one
as
is
listening
to
me
as
there
them
ought
to
go
to
the
king
and
get
him
to
let
off
my
son
felix
this
speech
in
its
chief
points
had
been
deliberately
prepared
holt
had
set
her
face
like
a
flint
to
make
the
gentry
know
their
duty
as
she
knew
hers
her
defiant
defensive
tone
was
due
to
the
consciousness
not
only
that
she
was
braving
a
powerful
audience
but
that
she
was
daring
to
stand
on
the
strong
basis
of
her
own
judgment
in
opposition
to
her
son
her
proposals
had
been
waived
off
by
mr
lyon
and
felix
but
she
had
long
had
the
feminine
conviction
that
if
she
could
get
to
speak
in
the
right
quarter
things
might
be
different
the
daring
bit
of
impromptu
about
the
three
transomes
was
immediately
suggested
by
a
movement
of
old
transome
to
the
foreground
in
a
line
with
lingon
and
harold
his
furred
and
unusual
costume
appearing
to
indicate
a
mysterious
dignity
which
she
must
hasten
to
include
in
her
appeal
and
there
were
reasons
that
none
could
have
foreseen
which
made
holt
remonstrance
immediately
effective
while
old
transome
stared
very
much
like
a
waxen
image
in
which
the
expression
is
a
failure
and
the
rector
accustomed
to
female
parishioners
and
complainants
looked
on
with
a
smile
in
his
eyes
harold
said
at
once
with
cordial
kindness
i
think
you
are
quite
right
holt
and
for
my
part
i
am
determined
to
do
my
best
for
your
son
both
in
the
and
elsewhere
take
comfort
if
it
is
necessary
the
king
shall
be
appealed
to
and
rely
upon
it
i
shall
bear
you
in
mind
as
felix
holt
mother
rapid
thoughts
had
convinced
harold
that
in
this
way
he
was
best
commending
himself
to
esther
well
sir
said
holt
who
was
not
going
to
pour
forth
disproportionate
thanks
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
speak
so
becoming
and
if
you
had
been
the
king
himself
i
should
have
made
free
to
tell
you
my
opinion
for
the
bible
says
the
king
favor
is
toward
a
wise
servant
and
it
reasonable
to
think
he
make
all
the
more
account
of
them
as
have
never
been
in
service
or
took
wage
which
i
never
did
and
never
thought
of
my
son
doing
and
his
father
left
money
meaning
otherways
so
as
he
might
have
been
a
doctor
on
horseback
at
this
very
minute
instead
of
being
in
prison
what
was
he
regularly
apprenticed
to
a
doctor
said
lingon
who
had
not
understood
this
before
sir
he
was
and
most
clever
like
his
father
before
him
only
he
turned
contrary
but
as
for
harming
anybody
felix
never
meant
to
harm
anybody
but
himself
and
his
mother
which
he
certainly
did
in
respect
of
his
clothes
and
taking
to
be
a
low
workingman
and
stopping
my
living
respectable
more
particular
by
the
pills
which
had
a
sale
as
you
may
be
sure
they
suited
people
insides
and
what
folks
can
never
have
boxes
enough
of
to
swallow
i
should
think
you
have
a
right
to
sell
and
there
many
and
many
a
text
for
it
as
i
opened
on
without
ever
thinking
for
if
it
true
and
you
shall
have
i
should
think
it
truer
when
you
willing
to
pay
for
what
you
have
this
was
a
little
too
much
for
lingon
gravity
he
exploded
and
harold
could
not
help
following
him
holt
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
distance
and
slapped
the
back
of
her
left
hand
again
it
might
be
that
this
kind
of
mirth
was
the
peculiar
effect
produced
by
forcible
truth
on
high
and
worldly
people
who
were
neither
in
the
independent
nor
the
general
baptist
connection
i
sure
you
must
be
tired
with
your
long
walk
and
little
job
too
said
esther
by
way
of
breaking
this
awkward
scene
are
you
job
she
added
stooping
to
caress
the
child
who
was
timidly
shrinking
from
harry
invitation
to
him
to
pull
the
little
chariot
harry
view
being
that
job
would
make
a
good
horse
for
him
to
beat
and
would
run
faster
than
gappa
it
well
you
can
feel
for
the
orphin
child
miss
lyon
said
holt
choosing
an
indirect
answer
rather
than
to
humble
herself
by
confessing
fatigue
before
gentlemen
who
seemed
to
be
taking
her
too
lightly
i
did
believe
but
what
you
behave
pretty
as
you
always
did
to
me
though
everybody
said
you
held
yourself
high
but
i
sure
you
never
did
to
felix
for
you
let
him
sit
by
you
at
the
free
school
before
all
the
town
and
him
with
never
a
bit
of
stock
round
his
neck
and
it
shows
you
saw
in
him
worth
taking
notice
of
and
it
is
but
right
if
you
know
my
words
are
true
as
you
should
speak
for
him
to
the
gentlemen
i
assure
you
holt
said
harold
coming
to
the
rescue
i
assure
you
that
enough
has
been
said
to
make
me
use
my
best
efforts
for
your
son
and
now
pray
go
on
to
the
house
with
the
little
boy
and
take
some
rest
dominic
show
holt
the
way
and
ask
hickes
to
make
her
comfortable
and
see
that
somebody
takes
her
back
to
treby
in
the
buggy
i
will
go
back
with
holt
said
esther
making
an
effort
against
herself
no
pray
said
harold
with
that
kind
of
entreaty
which
is
really
a
decision
let
holt
have
time
to
rest
we
shall
have
returned
and
you
can
see
her
before
she
goes
we
will
say
for
the
present
mrs
holt
the
poor
woman
was
not
sorry
to
have
the
prospect
of
rest
and
food
especially
for
the
orphin
child
of
whom
she
was
tenderly
careful
like
many
women
who
appear
to
others
to
have
a
masculine
decisiveness
of
tone
and
to
themselves
to
have
a
masculine
force
of
mind
and
who
come
into
severe
collision
with
sons
arrived
at
the
masterful
stage
she
had
the
maternal
cord
vibrating
strongly
within
her
toward
all
tiny
children
and
when
she
saw
dominic
pick
up
job
and
hoist
him
on
his
arm
for
a
little
while
by
way
of
making
acquaintance
she
regarded
him
with
an
approval
which
she
had
not
thought
it
possible
to
extend
to
a
foreigner
since
dominic
was
going
harry
and
old
transome
chose
to
follow
uncle
lingon
shook
hands
and
turned
off
across
the
grass
and
thus
esther
was
left
alone
with
harold
but
there
was
a
new
consciousness
between
them
harold
quick
perception
was
least
likely
to
be
slow
in
seizing
indications
of
anything
that
might
affect
his
position
with
regard
to
esther
some
time
before
his
jealousy
had
been
awakened
to
the
possibility
that
before
she
had
known
him
she
had
been
deeply
interested
in
some
one
else
jealousy
of
all
sorts
whether
for
our
fortune
or
our
love
is
ready
at
combinations
and
likely
even
to
outstrip
the
fact
and
esther
renewed
confusion
united
with
her
silence
about
felix
which
now
first
seemed
noteworthy
and
with
holt
graphic
details
as
to
her
walking
with
him
and
letting
him
sit
by
her
before
all
the
town
were
grounds
not
merely
for
a
suspicion
but
for
a
conclusion
in
harold
mind
the
effect
of
this
which
he
at
once
regarded
as
a
discovery
was
rather
different
from
what
esther
had
anticipated
it
seemed
to
him
that
felix
was
the
least
formidable
person
that
he
could
have
found
as
an
object
of
interest
antecedent
to
himself
a
young
workman
who
had
got
himself
thrown
into
prison
whatever
recommendations
he
might
have
had
for
a
girl
at
a
romantic
age
in
the
dreariness
of
dissenting
society
at
treby
could
hardly
be
considered
by
harold
in
the
light
of
a
rival
esther
was
too
clever
and
tasteful
a
woman
to
make
a
ballad
heroine
of
herself
by
bestowing
her
beauty
and
her
lands
on
this
lowly
lover
besides
harold
cherished
the
belief
that
at
the
present
time
esther
was
more
wisely
disposed
to
bestow
these
things
on
another
lover
in
every
way
eligible
but
in
two
directions
this
discovery
had
a
determining
effect
on
him
his
curiosity
was
stirred
to
know
exactly
what
the
relation
with
felix
had
been
and
he
was
solicitous
that
his
behavior
with
regard
to
this
young
man
should
be
such
as
to
enhance
his
own
merit
in
esther
eyes
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
inclined
to
any
euphemisms
that
would
seem
to
bring
felix
into
the
lists
with
himself
naturally
when
they
were
left
alone
it
was
harold
who
spoke
first
i
should
think
there
a
good
deal
of
worth
in
this
young
fellow
this
holt
notwithstanding
the
mistakes
he
has
made
a
little
queer
and
conceited
perhaps
but
that
is
usually
the
case
with
men
of
his
class
when
they
are
at
all
superior
to
their
fellows
felix
holt
is
a
highly
cultivated
man
he
is
not
at
all
conceited
said
esther
the
different
kinds
of
pride
within
her
were
coalescing
now
she
was
aware
that
there
had
been
a
betrayal
ah
said
harold
not
quite
liking
the
tone
of
this
answer
this
eccentricity
is
a
sort
of
fanaticism
then
this
giving
up
being
a
doctor
on
horseback
as
the
old
woman
calls
it
and
taking
to
let
me
see
watchmaking
is
it
if
it
is
eccentricity
to
be
very
much
better
than
other
men
he
is
certainly
eccentric
and
fanatical
too
if
it
is
fanatical
to
renounce
all
small
selfish
motives
for
the
sake
of
a
great
and
unselfish
one
i
never
knew
what
nobleness
of
character
really
was
before
i
knew
felix
holt
it
seemed
to
esther
as
if
in
the
excitement
of
this
moment
her
own
words
were
bringing
her
a
clearer
revelation
god
bless
me
said
harold
in
a
tone
of
surprised
yet
thorough
belief
and
looking
in
esther
face
i
wish
you
had
talked
to
me
about
this
before
esther
at
that
moment
looked
perfectly
beautiful
with
an
expression
which
harold
had
never
hitherto
seen
all
the
confusion
which
had
depended
on
personal
feeling
had
given
way
before
the
sense
that
she
had
to
speak
the
truth
about
the
man
whom
she
felt
to
be
admirable
i
think
i
did
see
the
meaning
of
anything
fine
i
did
even
see
the
value
of
my
father
character
until
i
had
been
taught
a
little
by
hearing
what
felix
holt
said
and
seeing
that
his
life
was
like
his
words
harold
looked
and
listened
and
felt
his
slight
jealousy
allayed
rather
than
heightened
this
is
not
like
love
he
said
to
himself
with
some
satisfaction
with
all
due
regard
to
harold
transome
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
liable
to
make
the
greater
mistakes
about
a
particular
woman
feelings
because
they
pique
themselves
on
a
power
of
interpretation
derived
from
much
experience
experience
is
enlightening
but
with
a
difference
experiments
on
live
animals
may
go
on
for
a
long
period
and
yet
the
fauna
on
which
they
are
made
may
be
limited
there
may
be
a
passion
in
the
mind
of
a
woman
which
precipitates
her
not
along
the
path
of
easy
beguilement
but
into
a
great
leap
away
from
it
harold
experience
had
not
taught
him
this
and
esther
enthusiasm
about
felix
holt
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
dangerous
he
quite
an
apostolic
sort
of
fellow
then
was
the
answer
he
gave
to
her
last
words
he
did
look
like
that
but
i
had
only
a
short
interview
with
him
and
i
was
given
to
understand
that
he
refused
to
see
me
in
prison
i
believe
he
not
very
well
inclined
toward
me
but
you
saw
a
great
deal
of
him
i
suppose
and
your
testimony
to
any
one
is
enough
for
me
said
harold
lowering
his
voice
rather
tenderly
now
i
know
what
your
opinion
is
i
shall
spare
no
effort
on
behalf
of
such
a
young
man
in
fact
i
had
come
to
the
same
resolution
before
but
your
wish
would
make
difficult
things
easy
after
that
energetic
speech
of
esther
as
often
happens
the
tears
had
just
suffused
her
eyes
it
was
nothing
more
than
might
have
been
expected
in
a
woman
considering
felix
circumstances
and
the
tears
only
made
more
lovely
the
look
with
which
she
met
harold
when
he
spoke
so
kindly
she
felt
pleased
with
him
she
was
open
to
the
fallacious
delight
of
being
assured
that
she
had
power
over
him
to
make
him
do
what
she
liked
and
quite
forgot
the
many
impressions
which
had
convinced
her
that
harold
had
a
padded
yoke
ready
for
the
neck
of
every
man
woman
and
child
that
depended
on
him
after
a
short
silence
they
were
getting
near
the
stone
gateway
and
harold
said
with
an
air
of
intimate
consultation
what
could
we
do
for
this
young
man
supposing
he
were
let
off
i
shall
send
a
letter
with
fifty
pounds
to
the
old
woman
i
ought
to
have
done
it
before
but
it
really
slipped
my
memory
amongst
the
many
things
that
have
occupied
me
lately
but
this
young
man
what
do
you
think
would
be
the
best
thing
we
could
do
for
him
if
he
gets
at
large
again
he
should
be
put
in
a
position
where
his
qualities
could
be
more
telling
esther
was
recovering
her
liveliness
a
little
and
was
disposed
to
encourage
it
for
the
sake
of
veiling
other
feelings
about
which
she
felt
renewed
reticence
now
that
the
overpowering
influence
of
her
enthusiasm
was
past
she
was
rather
wickedly
amused
and
scornful
at
harold
misconceptions
and
intentions
of
patronage
you
are
hopelessly
in
the
dark
she
said
with
a
light
laugh
and
toss
of
her
head
what
would
you
offer
felix
holt
a
place
in
the
excise
you
might
as
well
think
of
offering
it
to
john
the
baptist
felix
has
chosen
his
lot
he
means
always
to
be
a
poor
man
means
yes
said
harold
slightly
piqued
but
what
a
man
means
usually
depends
on
what
happens
i
mean
to
be
a
commoner
but
a
peerage
might
present
itself
under
acceptable
circumstances
oh
there
is
no
sum
in
proportion
to
be
done
there
said
esther
again
gaily
as
you
are
to
a
peerage
so
is
not
felix
holt
to
any
offer
of
advantage
that
you
could
imagine
for
him
you
must
think
him
fit
for
any
position
the
first
in
the
county
no
i
do
said
esther
shaking
her
head
mischievously
i
think
him
too
high
for
it
i
see
you
can
be
ardent
in
your
admiration
yes
it
is
my
champagne
you
know
i
do
like
the
other
kind
that
would
be
satisfactory
if
one
were
sure
of
getting
your
admiration
said
harold
leading
her
up
to
the
terrace
and
amongst
the
crocuses
from
whence
they
had
a
fine
view
of
the
park
and
river
they
stood
still
near
the
east
parapet
and
saw
the
dash
of
light
on
the
water
and
the
pencilled
shadows
of
the
trees
on
the
grassy
lawn
would
it
do
as
well
to
admire
you
instead
of
being
worthy
to
be
admired
said
harold
turning
his
eyes
from
that
landscape
to
face
it
would
be
a
thing
to
be
put
up
with
said
esther
smiling
at
him
rather
roguishly
but
you
are
not
in
that
state
of
well
i
am
conscious
of
not
having
those
severe
virtues
that
you
have
been
praising
that
is
true
you
are
quite
in
another
a
woman
would
not
find
me
a
tragic
hero
oh
no
she
must
dress
for
general
comedy
such
as
your
mother
once
described
to
me
where
the
most
thrilling
event
is
the
drawing
of
a
handsome
check
you
are
a
naughty
fairy
said
harold
daring
to
press
esther
hand
a
little
more
closely
to
him
and
drawing
her
down
the
eastern
steps
into
the
as
if
he
were
unwilling
to
give
up
the
conversation
confess
that
you
are
disgusted
with
my
want
of
romance
i
shall
not
confess
to
being
disgusted
i
shall
ask
you
to
confess
that
you
are
not
a
romantic
figure
i
am
a
little
too
stout
for
romance
yes
at
least
you
must
find
security
for
not
getting
stouter
and
i
do
look
languishing
enough
oh
yes
rather
too
much
so
at
a
fine
cigar
and
i
am
not
in
danger
of
committing
suicide
no
you
are
a
widower
harold
did
not
reply
immediately
to
this
last
thrust
of
esther
she
had
uttered
it
with
innocent
thoughtlessness
from
the
playful
suggestions
of
the
moment
but
it
was
a
fact
that
harold
previous
married
life
had
entered
strongly
in
her
impressions
about
him
the
presence
of
harry
made
it
inevitable
harold
took
this
allusion
of
esther
as
an
indication
that
his
quality
of
widower
was
a
point
that
made
against
him
and
after
a
brief
silence
he
said
in
an
altered
more
serious
tone
you
do
suppose
i
hope
that
any
other
woman
has
ever
held
the
place
that
you
could
hold
in
my
life
esther
began
to
tremble
a
little
as
she
always
did
when
the
between
them
seemed
getting
serious
she
only
gave
the
rather
stumbling
answer
how
so
harry
mother
had
been
a
slave
was
bought
in
fact
it
was
impossible
for
harold
to
preconceive
the
effect
this
had
on
esther
his
natural
disqualification
for
judging
of
a
girl
feelings
was
heightened
by
the
blinding
effect
of
an
exclusive
object
which
was
to
assure
her
that
her
own
place
was
peculiar
and
supreme
hitherto
esther
acquaintance
with
oriental
love
was
derived
chiefly
from
byronic
poems
and
this
had
not
sufficed
to
adjust
her
mind
to
a
new
story
where
the
giaour
concerned
was
giving
her
his
arm
she
was
unable
to
speak
and
harold
went
on
though
i
am
close
on
i
never
met
with
a
woman
at
all
like
you
before
there
are
new
eras
in
one
life
that
are
equivalent
to
youth
are
something
better
than
youth
i
was
never
an
aspirant
till
i
knew
you
esther
was
still
silent
not
that
i
dare
to
call
myself
that
i
am
not
so
confident
a
personage
as
you
imagine
i
am
necessarily
in
a
painful
position
for
a
man
who
has
any
feeling
here
at
last
harold
had
stirred
the
right
fibre
esther
generosity
seized
at
once
the
whole
meaning
implied
in
that
last
sentence
she
had
a
fine
sensibility
to
the
line
at
which
flirtation
must
cease
and
she
was
now
pale
and
shaken
with
feelings
she
had
not
yet
defined
for
herself
do
not
let
us
speak
of
difficult
things
any
more
now
she
said
with
gentle
seriousness
i
am
come
into
a
new
world
of
late
and
have
to
learn
life
all
over
again
let
us
go
in
i
must
see
poor
holt
again
and
my
little
friend
job
she
paused
at
the
glass
door
that
opened
on
the
terrace
and
entered
there
while
harold
went
round
to
the
stables
when
esther
had
been
and
descended
again
into
the
large
she
found
its
stony
capaciousness
made
lively
by
human
figures
extremely
unlike
the
statues
since
harry
insisted
on
playing
with
job
again
holt
and
her
orphan
after
dining
had
just
been
brought
to
this
delightful
scene
for
a
game
at
and
for
exhibiting
the
climbing
powers
of
the
two
pet
squirrels
holt
sat
on
a
stool
in
singular
relief
against
the
pedestal
of
the
apollo
while
dominic
and
denner
otherwise
hickes
bore
her
company
harry
in
his
bright
red
and
purple
flitted
about
like
a
great
tropic
bird
after
the
job
who
hid
himself
with
much
intelligence
behind
the
scagliola
pillars
and
the
pedestals
while
one
of
the
squirrels
perched
itself
on
the
head
of
the
tallest
statue
and
the
other
was
already
peeping
down
from
among
the
heavy
stuccoed
angels
on
the
ceiling
near
the
summit
of
a
pillar
holt
held
on
her
lap
a
basket
filled
with
good
things
for
job
and
seemed
much
soothed
by
pleasant
company
and
excellent
treatment
as
esther
descending
softly
and
unobserved
leaned
over
the
stone
banisters
and
looked
at
the
scene
for
a
minute
or
two
she
saw
that
holt
attention
having
been
directed
to
the
squirrel
which
had
scampered
on
to
the
head
of
the
silenus
carrying
the
infant
bacchus
had
been
drawn
downward
to
the
tiny
babe
looked
at
with
so
much
affection
by
the
rather
ugly
and
hairy
gentleman
of
whom
she
nevertheless
spoke
with
reserve
as
of
one
who
possibly
belonged
to
the
transome
family
it
most
pretty
to
see
its
little
limbs
and
the
gentleman
holding
it
i
should
think
he
was
amiable
by
his
look
but
it
was
odd
he
should
have
his
likeness
took
without
any
clothes
was
he
transome
by
name
holt
suspected
that
there
might
be
a
mild
madness
in
the
family
denner
peering
and
smiling
quietly
was
about
to
reply
when
she
was
prevented
by
the
appearance
of
old
transome
who
since
his
walk
had
been
having
forty
winks
on
the
sofa
in
the
library
and
now
came
out
to
look
for
harry
he
had
doffed
his
fur
cap
and
cloak
but
in
lying
down
to
sleep
he
had
thrown
over
his
shoulders
a
soft
oriental
scarf
which
harold
had
given
him
and
this
still
hung
over
his
scanty
white
hair
and
down
to
his
knees
held
fast
by
his
arms
and
hands
which
fell
in
front
of
him
this
singular
appearance
of
an
undoubted
transome
fitted
exactly
into
holt
thought
at
the
moment
it
lay
in
the
probabilities
of
things
that
gentry
intellects
should
be
peculiar
since
they
had
not
to
get
their
own
living
the
good
lord
might
have
economized
in
their
case
that
which
others
were
so
much
more
in
need
of
and
in
the
shuffling
figure
before
her
she
saw
a
descendant
of
the
gentleman
who
had
chosen
to
be
represented
without
his
clothes
all
the
more
eccentric
where
there
were
the
means
of
buying
the
best
but
these
oddities
said
nothing
in
great
folks
who
were
powerful
in
high
quarters
all
the
same
and
holt
rose
and
courtesied
with
a
proud
respect
precisely
as
she
would
have
done
if
transome
had
looked
as
wise
as
lord
burleigh
i
hope
i
in
no
way
taking
a
liberty
sir
she
began
while
the
old
gentleman
looked
at
her
with
bland
feebleness
i
not
that
woman
to
sit
anywhere
out
of
my
own
home
without
inviting
and
pressing
to
but
i
was
brought
here
to
wait
because
the
little
gentleman
wanted
to
play
with
the
orphin
child
very
glad
my
good
woman
sit
down
sit
down
said
transome
nodding
and
smiling
between
his
clauses
nice
little
boy
your
grandchild
indeed
sir
no
said
holt
continuing
to
stand
quite
apart
from
any
awe
of
transome
sitting
down
she
felt
would
be
a
too
great
familiarity
with
her
own
pathetic
importance
on
this
extra
and
occasion
it
not
me
has
any
grandchild
nor
ever
shall
have
though
most
fit
but
with
my
only
son
saying
he
never
be
married
and
in
prison
besides
and
some
saying
he
be
transported
you
may
see
yourself
though
a
gentleman
as
there
is
much
chance
of
my
having
grandchildren
of
my
own
and
this
is
old
master
grandchild
as
my
own
felix
took
to
for
pity
because
he
was
sickly
and
clemm
and
i
was
noways
against
it
being
of
a
tender
heart
for
i
a
widow
myself
and
my
son
felix
though
big
is
fatherless
and
i
know
my
duty
in
consequence
and
it
to
be
wished
sir
as
others
should
know
it
as
are
more
in
power
and
live
in
great
houses
and
can
ride
in
a
carriage
where
they
will
and
if
you
the
gentleman
as
is
the
head
of
everything
and
it
not
to
be
thought
you
give
up
to
your
son
as
a
poor
widow
been
forced
to
do
it
behooves
you
to
take
the
part
of
them
as
are
deserving
for
the
bible
says
gray
hairs
should
speak
yes
yes
poor
woman
what
shall
i
say
said
old
transome
feeling
himself
scolded
and
as
usual
desirous
of
mollifying
displeasure
sir
i
can
tell
you
what
to
say
fast
enough
for
it
what
i
should
say
myself
if
i
could
get
to
speak
to
the
king
for
i
asked
them
that
know
and
they
say
it
the
truth
both
out
of
the
bible
and
in
as
the
king
can
pardon
anything
and
anybody
and
judging
by
his
countenance
on
the
new
signs
and
the
talk
there
was
a
while
ago
about
his
being
the
people
friend
as
the
minister
once
said
it
from
the
very
pulpit
if
there
any
meaning
in
words
he
do
the
right
thing
by
me
and
my
son
if
he
asked
proper
yes
a
very
good
man
he
do
anything
right
said
transome
whose
own
ideas
about
the
king
just
then
were
somewhat
misty
consisting
chiefly
in
broken
reminiscences
of
george
iii
i
ask
him
anything
you
like
he
added
with
a
pressing
desire
to
satisfy
holt
who
alarmed
him
slightly
then
sir
if
you
go
in
your
carriage
and
say
this
young
man
felix
holt
by
name
as
his
father
was
known
the
country
round
and
his
mother
most
respectable
he
never
meant
harm
to
anybody
and
so
far
from
bloody
murder
and
fighting
would
part
with
his
victual
to
them
that
needed
it
more
and
if
you
get
other
gentlemen
to
say
the
same
and
if
not
satisfied
to
enquire
i
not
believe
but
what
the
king
let
my
son
out
of
prison
or
if
it
true
he
must
stand
his
trial
the
king
take
care
no
mischief
happened
to
him
i
got
my
senses
and
never
believe
as
in
a
country
where
there
a
god
above
and
a
king
below
the
right
thing
ca
be
done
if
great
people
was
willing
to
do
it
holt
like
all
orators
had
waxed
louder
and
more
energetic
ceasing
to
propel
her
arguments
and
being
propelled
by
them
poor
old
transome
getting
more
and
more
frightened
at
this
woman
who
had
the
horrible
possibility
to
his
mind
of
being
a
novelty
that
was
to
become
permanent
seemed
to
be
fascinated
by
fear
and
stood
helplessly
forgetful
that
if
he
liked
he
might
turn
round
and
walk
away
little
harry
alive
to
anything
that
had
relation
to
gappa
had
paused
in
his
game
and
discerning
what
he
thought
a
hostile
aspect
in
this
naughty
black
old
woman
rushed
toward
her
and
proceeded
first
to
beat
her
with
his
mimic
jockey
whip
and
then
suspecting
that
her
bombazine
was
not
sensitive
to
set
his
teeth
in
her
arm
while
dominic
rebuked
him
and
pulled
him
off
nimrod
began
to
bark
anxiously
and
the
scene
was
become
alarming
even
to
the
squirrels
which
scrambled
as
far
off
as
possible
esther
who
had
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
of
intervention
now
came
up
to
holt
to
speak
some
soothing
words
and
old
transome
seeing
a
sufficient
screen
between
himself
and
his
formidable
suppliant
at
last
gathered
courage
to
turn
round
and
shuffle
away
with
unusual
swiftness
into
the
library
dear
holt
said
esther
do
rest
comforted
i
assure
you
you
have
done
the
utmost
that
can
be
done
by
your
words
your
visit
has
not
been
thrown
away
see
how
the
children
have
enjoyed
it
i
saw
little
job
actually
laughing
i
think
i
never
saw
him
do
more
than
smile
before
then
turning
round
to
dominic
she
said
will
the
buggy
come
round
to
this
door
this
hint
was
sufficient
dominic
went
to
see
if
the
vehicle
was
ready
and
denner
remarking
that
holt
would
like
to
mount
it
in
the
inner
court
invited
her
to
go
back
into
the
housekeeper
room
but
there
was
a
fresh
resistance
raised
in
harry
by
the
threatened
departure
of
job
who
had
seemed
an
invaluable
addition
to
the
menagerie
of
tamed
creatures
and
it
was
barely
in
time
that
esther
had
the
relief
of
seeing
the
entrance
hall
cleared
so
as
to
prevent
any
further
encounter
of
holt
with
harold
who
was
now
coming
up
the
flight
of
steps
at
the
entrance
chapter
xliv
i
sick
at
heart
the
eye
of
day
the
insistent
summer
noon
seems
pitiless
shining
in
all
the
barren
crevices
of
weary
life
leaving
no
shade
no
dark
where
i
may
dream
that
hidden
waters
lie
shortly
after
holt
striking
presentation
of
herself
at
transome
court
esther
went
on
a
second
visit
to
her
father
the
loamford
assizes
were
approaching
it
was
expected
that
in
about
ten
days
felix
trial
would
come
on
and
some
hints
in
her
father
letters
had
given
esther
the
impression
that
he
was
taking
a
melancholy
view
of
the
result
harold
transome
had
once
or
twice
mentioned
the
subject
with
a
facile
hopefulness
as
to
the
young
fellow
coming
off
easily
which
in
her
anxious
mind
was
not
a
counterpoise
to
disquieting
suggestions
and
she
had
not
chosen
to
introduce
another
conversation
about
felix
holt
by
questioning
harold
concerning
the
probabilities
he
relied
on
since
those
moments
on
the
terrace
harold
had
daily
become
more
of
the
solicitous
and
indirectly
beseeching
lover
and
esther
from
the
very
fact
that
she
was
weighed
on
by
thoughts
that
were
painfully
bewildering
to
her
by
thoughts
which
in
their
newness
to
her
young
mind
seemed
to
shake
her
belief
that
life
could
be
anything
else
than
a
compromise
with
things
repugnant
to
the
moral
taste
had
become
more
passive
to
his
attentions
at
the
very
time
that
she
had
begun
to
feel
more
profoundly
that
in
accepting
harold
transome
she
left
the
high
mountain
air
the
passionate
serenity
of
perfect
love
forever
behind
her
and
must
adjust
her
wishes
to
a
life
of
middling
delights
overhung
with
the
languorous
haziness
of
motiveless
ease
where
poetry
was
only
literature
and
the
fine
ideas
had
to
be
taken
down
from
the
shelves
of
the
library
when
her
husband
back
was
turned
but
it
seemed
as
if
all
outward
conditions
concurred
along
with
her
generous
sympathy
for
the
transomes
and
with
those
native
tendencies
against
which
she
had
once
begun
to
struggle
to
make
this
middling
lot
the
best
she
could
attain
to
she
was
in
this
resignation
to
something
like
what
is
called
worldly
wisdom
when
she
went
to
see
her
father
and
learn
what
she
could
from
him
about
felix
the
little
minister
was
much
depressed
unable
to
resign
himself
to
the
dread
which
had
begun
to
haunt
him
that
felix
might
have
to
endure
the
odious
penalty
of
transportation
for
the
manslaughter
which
was
the
offence
that
no
evidence
in
his
favor
could
disprove
i
had
been
encouraged
by
the
assurances
of
men
instructed
in
this
regard
said
lyon
while
esther
sat
on
the
stool
near
him
and
listened
anxiously
that
though
he
were
pronounced
guilty
in
regard
to
this
deed
whereunto
he
hath
calamitously
fallen
yet
that
a
judge
mildly
disposed
and
with
a
due
sense
of
that
invisible
activity
of
the
soul
whereby
the
deeds
which
are
the
same
in
outward
appearance
and
effect
yet
differ
as
the
of
the
surgeon
even
though
it
kill
differs
from
the
of
a
wanton
mutilater
might
use
his
discretion
in
tempering
the
punishment
so
that
it
would
not
be
very
evil
to
bear
but
now
it
is
said
that
the
judge
who
cometh
is
a
severe
man
and
one
nourishing
a
prejudice
against
the
bolder
spirits
who
stand
not
in
the
old
paths
i
am
going
to
be
present
at
the
trial
father
said
esther
who
was
preparing
the
way
to
express
a
wish
which
she
was
timid
about
even
with
her
father
i
mentioned
to
transome
that
i
should
like
to
do
so
and
she
said
that
she
used
in
old
days
always
to
attend
the
assizes
and
that
she
would
take
me
you
will
be
there
father
assuredly
i
shall
be
there
having
been
summoned
to
bear
witness
to
felix
character
and
to
his
having
uttered
remonstrances
and
warnings
long
beforehand
whereby
he
proved
himself
an
enemy
to
riot
in
our
ears
who
know
him
it
sounds
strangely
that
aught
else
should
be
credible
but
he
hath
few
to
speak
for
him
though
i
trust
that
harold
transome
testimony
will
go
far
if
as
you
say
he
is
disposed
to
set
aside
minor
regards
and
not
to
speak
the
truth
grudgingly
and
reluctantly
for
the
very
truth
hath
a
color
from
the
disposition
of
the
utterer
he
is
kind
he
is
capable
of
being
generous
said
esther
it
is
well
for
i
verily
believe
that
men
have
been
at
work
against
felix
the
hath
written
continually
in
allusion
to
him
as
one
of
those
mischievous
men
who
seek
to
elevate
themselves
through
the
dishonor
of
their
party
and
as
one
of
those
who
go
not
heart
and
soul
with
the
needs
of
the
people
but
seek
only
to
get
a
hearing
for
themselves
by
raising
their
voices
in
crotchety
discord
it
is
these
things
that
cause
me
heaviness
of
spirit
the
dark
secret
of
this
young
man
lot
is
a
cross
i
carry
daily
father
said
esther
timidly
while
the
eyes
of
both
were
filling
with
tears
i
should
like
to
see
him
again
before
his
trial
might
i
will
you
ask
him
will
you
take
me
the
minister
raised
his
suffused
eyes
to
hers
and
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
a
new
thought
had
visited
him
but
his
delicate
tenderness
shrank
even
from
an
inward
enquiry
that
was
too
curious
that
seemed
like
an
effort
to
peep
at
sacred
secrets
i
see
naught
against
it
my
dear
child
if
you
arrived
early
enough
and
would
take
the
elderly
lady
into
your
confidence
so
that
you
might
descend
from
the
carriage
at
some
suitable
place
the
house
of
the
independent
minister
for
example
where
i
could
meet
and
accompany
you
i
would
forewarn
felix
who
would
doubtless
delight
to
see
your
face
again
seeing
that
he
may
go
away
and
be
as
it
were
buried
from
you
even
though
it
may
be
only
in
prison
and
not
this
was
too
much
for
esther
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
and
sobbed
like
a
child
it
was
an
unspeakable
relief
to
her
after
all
the
stifling
experience
all
the
inward
incommunicable
debate
of
the
last
few
weeks
the
old
man
was
deeply
moved
too
and
held
his
arm
close
round
the
dear
child
praying
silently
no
word
was
spoken
for
some
minutes
till
esther
raised
herself
dried
her
eyes
and
with
an
action
that
seemed
playful
though
there
was
no
smile
on
her
face
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
father
cheeks
then
when
she
had
put
her
hand
in
his
he
said
solemnly
is
a
great
and
mysterious
gift
this
clinging
of
the
heart
my
esther
whereby
it
hath
often
seemed
to
me
that
even
in
the
very
moment
of
suffering
our
souls
have
the
keenest
foretaste
of
heaven
i
speak
not
lightly
but
as
one
who
hath
endured
and
is
a
strange
truth
that
only
in
the
agony
of
parting
we
look
into
the
depths
of
love
so
the
interview
ended
without
any
question
from
lyon
concerning
what
esther
contemplated
as
the
ultimate
arrangement
between
herself
and
the
transomes
after
this
conversation
which
showed
him
that
what
happened
to
felix
touched
esther
more
closely
than
he
had
supposed
the
minister
felt
no
impulse
to
raise
the
images
of
a
future
so
unlike
anything
that
felix
would
share
and
esther
would
have
been
unable
to
answer
any
such
questions
the
successive
weeks
instead
of
bringing
her
nearer
to
clearness
and
decision
had
only
brought
that
state
of
disenchantment
belonging
to
the
actual
presence
of
things
which
have
long
dwelt
in
the
imagination
with
all
the
factitious
charms
of
arbitrary
arrangement
her
imaginary
mansion
had
not
been
inhabited
just
as
transome
court
was
her
imaginary
fortune
had
not
been
attended
with
circumstances
which
she
was
unable
to
sweep
away
she
herself
in
her
utopia
had
never
been
what
she
was
now
a
woman
whose
heart
was
divided
and
oppressed
the
first
spontaneous
offering
of
her
woman
devotion
the
first
great
inspiration
of
her
life
was
a
sort
of
vanished
ecstasy
which
had
left
its
wounds
it
seemed
to
her
a
cruel
misfortune
of
her
young
life
that
her
best
feeling
her
most
precious
dependence
had
been
called
forth
just
where
the
conditions
were
hardest
and
that
all
the
easy
invitations
of
circumstance
were
toward
something
which
that
previous
consecration
of
her
longing
had
made
a
moral
descent
for
her
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
she
scarcely
at
all
entertained
the
alternative
of
such
a
compromise
as
would
have
given
her
the
larger
portion
of
the
fortune
to
which
she
had
a
legal
claim
and
yet
have
satisfied
her
sympathy
by
leaving
the
transomes
in
possession
of
their
old
home
her
domestication
with
this
family
had
brought
them
into
the
foreground
of
her
imagination
the
gradual
wooing
of
harold
had
acted
on
her
with
a
constant
immediate
influence
that
predominated
over
all
indefinite
prospects
and
a
solitary
elevation
to
wealth
which
out
of
utopia
she
had
no
notion
how
she
should
manage
looked
as
chill
and
dreary
as
the
offer
of
dignities
in
an
unknown
country
in
the
ages
since
adam
marriage
it
has
been
good
for
some
men
to
be
alone
and
for
some
women
also
but
esther
was
not
one
of
these
women
she
was
intensely
of
the
feminine
type
verging
neither
toward
the
saint
nor
the
angel
she
was
a
fair
divided
excellence
whose
fullness
of
perfection
must
be
in
marriage
and
like
all
youthful
creatures
she
felt
as
if
the
present
conditions
of
choice
were
final
it
belonged
to
the
freshness
of
her
heart
that
having
had
her
emotions
strongly
stirred
by
real
objects
she
never
speculated
on
possible
relations
yet
to
come
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
stood
at
the
first
and
last
parting
of
the
ways
and
in
one
sense
she
was
under
no
illusion
it
is
only
in
that
freshness
of
our
time
that
the
choice
is
possible
which
gives
unity
to
life
and
makes
the
memory
a
temple
where
all
relics
and
all
votive
offerings
all
worship
and
all
grateful
joy
are
an
unbroken
history
sanctified
by
one
religion
chapter

we
may
not
make
this
world
a
paradise
by
walking
it
together
with
clasped
hands
and
eyes
that
meeting
feed
a
double
strength
we
must
be
only
joined
by
pains
divine
of
spirits
blent
in
mutual
memories
it
was
a
consequence
of
that
interview
with
her
father
that
when
esther
stepped
early
on
a
gray
march
morning
into
the
carriage
with
transome
to
go
to
the
loamford
assizes
she
was
full
of
an
expectation
that
held
her
lips
in
trembling
silence
and
gave
her
eyes
that
sightless
beauty
which
tells
that
the
vision
is
all
within
transome
did
not
disturb
her
with
unnecessary
speech
of
late
esther
anxious
observation
had
been
drawn
to
a
change
in
transome
shown
in
many
small
ways
which
only
women
notice
it
was
not
only
that
when
they
sat
together
the
talk
seemed
more
of
an
effort
to
her
that
might
have
come
from
the
gradual
draining
away
of
matter
for
discourse
pertaining
to
most
sorts
of
companionship
in
which
repetition
is
not
felt
to
be
as
desirable
as
novelty
but
while
transome
was
dressed
just
as
usual
took
her
seat
as
usual
trifled
with
her
drugs
and
had
her
embroidery
before
her
as
usual
and
still
made
her
morning
greetings
with
that
finished
easy
politeness
and
consideration
of
tone
which
to
rougher
people
seems
like
affectation
esther
noticed
a
strange
fitfulness
in
her
movements
sometimes
the
stitches
of
her
embroidery
went
on
with
silent
unbroken
swiftness
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
as
if
she
had
to
work
out
her
deliverance
from
bondage
by
finishing
a
border
then
her
hands
dropped
suddenly
and
her
gaze
fell
blankly
on
the
table
before
her
and
she
would
sit
in
that
way
motionless
as
a
seated
statue
apparently
unconscious
of
presence
till
some
thought
darting
within
her
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
an
external
shock
and
rouse
her
with
a
start
when
she
looked
around
hastily
like
a
person
ashamed
of
having
slept
esther
touched
with
wondering
pity
at
signs
of
unhappiness
that
were
new
in
her
experience
took
the
most
delicate
care
to
appear
inobservant
and
only
tried
to
increase
the
gentle
attention
that
might
help
to
soothe
or
gratify
this
uneasy
woman
but
one
morning
transome
had
said
breaking
a
rather
long
silence
my
dear
i
shall
make
this
house
dull
for
you
you
sit
with
me
like
an
embodied
patience
i
am
unendurable
i
am
getting
into
a
melancholy
dotage
a
fidgety
old
woman
like
me
is
as
unpleasant
to
see
as
a
rook
with
its
wing
broken
do
mind
me
my
dear
run
away
from
me
without
ceremony
every
one
else
does
you
see
i
am
part
of
the
old
furniture
with
new
drapery
dear
transome
said
esther
gliding
to
the
low
ottoman
close
by
the
basket
of
embroidery
do
you
dislike
my
sitting
with
you
only
for
your
own
sake
my
fairy
said
transome
smiling
faintly
and
putting
her
hand
under
esther
chin
does
it
make
you
shudder
to
look
at
me
why
will
you
say
such
naughty
things
said
esther
affectionately
if
you
had
had
a
daughter
she
would
have
desired
to
be
with
you
most
when
you
most
wanted
cheering
and
surely
every
young
woman
has
something
of
a
daughter
feeling
toward
an
older
one
who
has
been
kind
to
her
i
should
like
you
to
be
really
my
daughter
said
transome
rousing
herself
to
look
a
little
brighter
that
is
something
still
for
an
old
woman
to
hope
for
esther
blushed
she
had
not
foreseen
this
application
of
words
that
came
from
pitying
tenderness
to
divert
the
train
of
thought
as
quickly
as
possible
she
at
once
asked
what
she
had
previously
had
in
her
mind
to
ask
before
her
blush
had
disappeared
she
said
oh
you
are
so
good
i
shall
ask
you
to
indulge
me
very
much
it
is
to
let
us
set
out
very
early
to
loamford
on
wednesday
and
put
me
down
at
a
particular
house
that
i
may
keep
an
appointment
with
my
father
it
is
a
private
matter
that
i
wish
no
one
to
know
about
if
possible
and
he
will
bring
me
back
to
you
wherever
you
appoint
in
that
way
esther
won
her
end
without
needing
to
betray
it
and
as
harold
was
already
away
at
loamford
she
was
the
more
secure
the
independent
minister
house
at
which
she
was
set
down
and
where
she
was
received
by
her
father
was
in
a
quiet
street
not
far
from
the
jail
esther
had
thrown
a
dark
cloak
over
the
handsomer
coverings
which
denner
had
assured
her
were
absolutely
required
of
ladies
who
sat
anywhere
near
the
judge
at
a
great
trial
and
as
the
bonnet
of
that
day
did
not
throw
the
face
into
high
relief
but
rather
into
perspective
a
veil
drawn
down
gave
her
a
sufficiently
inconspicuous
appearance
i
have
arranged
all
things
my
dear
said
lyon
and
felix
expects
us
we
will
lose
no
time
they
walked
away
at
once
esther
not
asking
a
question
she
had
no
consciousness
of
the
road
along
which
they
passed
she
could
never
remember
anything
but
a
dim
sense
of
entering
within
high
walls
and
going
along
passages
till
they
were
ushered
into
a
larger
space
than
she
had
expected
and
her
father
said
it
is
here
that
we
are
permitted
to
see
felix
my
esther
he
will
presently
appear
esther
automatically
took
off
her
gloves
and
bonnet
as
if
she
had
entered
the
house
after
a
walk
she
had
lost
the
complete
consciousness
of
everything
except
that
she
was
going
to
see
felix
she
trembled
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
he
too
would
look
altered
after
her
new
life
as
if
even
the
past
would
change
for
her
and
be
no
longer
a
steadfast
remembrance
but
something
she
had
been
mistaken
about
as
she
had
been
about
the
new
life
perhaps
she
was
growing
out
of
that
childhood
to
which
common
things
have
rareness
and
all
objects
look
larger
perhaps
from
henceforth
the
whole
world
was
to
be
meaner
for
her
the
dread
concentrated
in
those
few
moments
seemed
worse
than
anything
she
had
known
before
it
was
what
the
dread
of
the
pilgrim
might
be
who
has
it
whispered
to
him
that
the
holy
places
are
a
delusion
or
that
he
will
see
them
with
a
soul
unstirred
and
unbelieving
every
minute
that
passes
may
be
charged
with
some
such
crisis
in
the
little
inner
world
of
man
or
woman
but
soon
the
door
opened
slightly
someone
looked
in
then
it
opened
wide
and
felix
holt
entered
miss
lyon
esther
and
her
hand
was
in
his
grasp
he
was
just
the
same
no
something
inexpressibly
better
because
of
the
distance
and
separation
and
the
novelties
which
made
him
like
the
return
of
the
morning
take
no
heed
of
me
children
said
lyon
i
have
some
notes
to
make
and
my
time
is
precious
we
may
remain
here
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
old
man
sat
down
at
a
window
with
his
back
to
them
writing
with
his
head
bent
close
to
the
paper
you
are
very
pale
you
look
ill
compared
with
your
old
self
said
esther
she
had
taken
her
hand
away
but
they
stood
still
near
each
other
she
looking
up
at
him
the
fact
is
i
not
fond
of
prison
said
felix
smiling
but
i
suppose
the
best
i
can
hope
for
is
to
have
a
good
deal
more
of
it
it
is
thought
that
in
the
worst
case
a
pardon
may
be
obtained
said
esther
avoiding
harold
transome
name
i
do
rely
on
that
said
felix
shaking
his
head
my
wisest
course
is
to
make
up
my
mind
to
the
very
ugliest
penalty
they
can
condemn
me
to
if
i
can
face
that
anything
less
will
seem
easy
but
you
know
he
went
on
smiling
at
her
brightly
i
never
went
in
for
fine
company
and
cushions
i
ca
be
very
heavily
disappointed
in
that
way
do
you
see
things
just
as
you
used
to
do
said
esther
turning
pale
as
she
said
it
i
mean
about
poverty
and
the
people
you
will
live
among
has
all
the
misunderstanding
and
sadness
left
you
just
as
obstinate
she
tried
to
smile
but
could
not
succeed
what
about
the
sort
of
life
i
should
lead
if
i
were
free
again
said
felix
yes
i
ca
help
being
discouraged
for
you
by
all
these
things
that
have
happened
see
how
you
may
fail
esther
spoke
timidly
she
saw
a
peculiar
smile
which
she
knew
well
gathering
in
his
eyes
ah
i
dare
say
i
am
silly
she
said
deprecatingly
no
you
are
dreadfully
inspired
said
felix
when
the
wicked
tempter
is
tired
of
snarling
that
word
failure
in
a
man
cell
he
sends
a
voice
like
a
thrush
to
say
it
for
him
see
now
what
a
messenger
of
darkness
you
are
he
smiled
and
took
her
two
hands
between
his
pressed
together
as
children
hold
them
up
in
prayer
both
of
them
felt
too
solemnly
to
be
bashful
they
looked
straight
into
each
other
eyes
as
angels
do
when
they
tell
some
truth
and
they
stood
in
that
way
while
he
went
on
speaking
but
i
proof
against
that
word
failure
i
seen
behind
it
the
only
failure
a
man
ought
to
fear
is
failure
in
cleaving
to
the
purpose
he
sees
to
be
best
as
to
just
the
amount
of
result
he
may
see
from
his
particular
work
that
a
tremendous
uncertainty
the
universe
has
not
been
arranged
for
the
gratification
of
his
feelings
as
long
as
a
man
sees
and
believes
in
some
great
good
he
prefer
working
toward
that
in
the
way
he
best
fit
for
come
what
may
i
put
effects
at
their
minimum
but
i
rather
have
the
maximum
of
effect
if
it
of
the
sort
i
care
for
than
the
maximum
of
effect
i
do
care
for
a
lot
of
fine
things
that
are
not
to
my
taste
and
if
they
were
the
conditions
of
holding
them
while
the
world
is
what
it
is
are
such
as
would
jar
on
me
like
grating
metal
yes
said
esther
in
a
lone
tone
i
think
i
understand
that
now
better
than
i
used
to
do
the
words
of
felix
at
last
seemed
strangely
to
fit
her
own
experience
but
she
said
no
more
though
he
seemed
to
wait
for
it
a
moment
or
two
looking
at
her
but
then
he
went
on
i
do
mean
to
be
illustrious
you
know
and
make
a
new
era
else
it
would
be
kind
of
you
to
get
a
raven
and
teach
it
to
croak
in
my
ears
where
great
things
ca
happen
i
care
for
very
small
things
such
as
will
never
be
known
beyond
a
few
garrets
and
workshops
and
then
as
to
one
thing
i
believe
in
i
do
think
i
can
altogether
fail
if
there
anything
our
people
want
convincing
of
it
is
that
some
dignity
and
happiness
for
a
man
other
than
changing
his
station
that
one
of
the
beliefs
i
choose
to
consecrate
my
life
to
if
anybody
could
demonstrate
to
me
that
i
was
a
flat
for
it
i
should
think
it
would
follow
that
i
must
borrow
money
to
set
up
genteelly
and
order
new
clothes
that
not
a
rigorous
consequence
to
my
understanding
they
smiled
at
each
other
with
the
old
sense
of
amusement
they
had
so
often
had
together
you
are
just
the
same
said
esther
and
you
said
felix
my
affairs
have
been
settled
long
ago
but
yours
a
great
change
has
come
in
them
magic
at
work
yes
said
esther
rather
falteringly
well
said
felix
looking
at
her
gravely
again
it
a
case
of
fitness
that
seems
to
give
a
chance
sanction
to
that
musty
law
the
first
time
i
saw
you
your
birth
was
an
immense
puzzle
to
me
however
the
appropriate
conditions
are
come
at
last
these
words
seemed
cruel
to
esther
but
felix
could
not
know
all
the
reasons
for
their
seeming
so
she
could
not
speak
she
was
turning
cold
and
feeling
her
heart
beat
painfully
all
your
tastes
are
gratified
now
he
went
on
innocently
but
remember
the
old
pedagogue
and
his
lectures
one
thought
in
the
mind
of
felix
was
that
esther
was
sure
to
marry
harold
transome
men
readily
believe
these
things
of
the
women
who
love
them
but
he
could
not
allude
to
the
marriage
more
directly
he
was
afraid
of
this
destiny
for
her
without
having
any
very
distinct
knowledge
by
which
to
justify
his
fear
to
the
mind
of
another
it
did
not
satisfy
him
that
esther
should
marry
harold
transome
my
children
said
lyon
at
this
moment
not
looking
round
but
only
looking
close
at
his
watch
we
have
just
two
minutes
more
then
he
went
on
writing
esther
did
not
speak
but
felix
could
not
help
observing
now
that
her
hands
had
turned
to
a
deathly
coldness
and
that
she
was
trembling
he
believed
he
knew
that
whatever
prospects
she
had
this
feeling
was
for
his
sake
an
overpowering
impulse
from
mingled
love
gratitude
and
anxiety
urged
him
to
say
i
had
a
horrible
struggle
esther
but
you
see
i
was
right
there
was
a
fitting
lot
in
reserve
for
you
but
remember
you
have
cost
a
great
price
do
throw
what
is
precious
away
i
shall
want
the
news
that
you
have
a
happiness
worthy
of
you
esther
felt
too
miserable
for
tears
to
come
she
looked
helplessly
at
felix
for
a
moment
then
took
her
hands
from
his
and
turning
away
mutely
walked
dreamily
toward
her
father
and
said
father
i
am
ready
there
is
no
more
to
say
she
turned
back
again
toward
the
chair
where
her
bonnet
lay
with
a
face
quite
above
her
dark
garments
esther
she
heard
felix
say
the
word
with
an
entreating
cry
and
went
toward
him
with
the
swift
movement
of
a
frightened
child
toward
its
protector
he
clasped
her
and
they
kissed
each
other
she
never
could
recall
anything
else
that
happened
till
she
was
in
the
carriage
again
with
transome
chapter
xlvi
why
there
are
maidens
of
heroic
touch
and
yet
they
seem
like
things
of
gossamer
you
pinch
the
life
out
of
as
out
of
moths
oh
it
is
not
loud
tones
and
mouthingness
is
not
the
arms
akimbo
and
large
strides
that
make
a
woman
force
the
tiniest
birds
with
softest
downy
breasts
have
passions
in
them
and
are
brave
with
love
esther
was
so
placed
in
the
court
under
transome
wing
as
to
see
and
hear
everything
without
effort
harold
had
received
them
at
the
hotel
and
had
observed
that
esther
looked
ill
and
was
unusually
abstracted
in
her
manner
but
this
seemed
to
be
sufficiently
accounted
for
by
her
sympathetic
anxiety
about
the
result
of
a
trial
in
which
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
was
a
friend
and
in
which
both
her
father
and
himself
were
important
witnesses
transome
had
no
reluctance
to
keep
a
small
secret
from
her
son
and
no
betrayal
was
made
of
that
previous
engagement
of
esther
with
her
father
harold
was
particularly
delicate
and
unobtrusive
in
his
attentions
he
had
the
consciousness
that
he
was
going
to
behave
in
a
way
that
would
gratify
esther
and
win
her
admiration
and
we
are
all
of
us
made
more
graceful
by
the
inward
presence
of
what
we
believe
to
be
a
generous
purpose
our
actions
move
to
a
hidden
music
a
melody
that
sweetly
played
in
tune
if
esther
had
been
less
absorbed
by
supreme
feelings
she
would
have
been
aware
that
she
was
an
object
of
special
notice
in
the
bare
squareness
of
a
public
hall
where
there
was
not
one
jutting
angle
to
hang
a
guess
or
a
thought
upon
not
an
image
or
a
bit
of
color
to
stir
the
fancy
and
where
the
only
objects
of
speculation
of
admiration
or
of
any
interest
whatever
were
human
beings
that
occupied
positions
indicating
some
importance
the
notice
bestowed
on
esther
would
not
have
been
surprising
even
if
it
had
been
merely
a
tribute
to
her
youthful
charm
which
was
well
championed
by
transome
elderly
majesty
but
it
was
due
also
to
whisperings
that
she
was
an
hereditary
claimant
of
the
transome
estates
whom
harold
transome
was
about
to
marry
harold
himself
had
of
late
not
cared
to
conceal
either
the
fact
or
the
probability
they
both
tended
rather
to
his
honor
than
his
dishonor
and
when
there
was
a
good
proportion
of
trebians
present
the
whisperings
spread
rapidly
the
court
was
still
more
crowded
than
on
the
previous
day
when
our
poor
acquaintance
dredge
and
his
two
collier
companions
were
sentenced
to
a
year
imprisonment
with
hard
labor
and
the
more
enlightened
prisoner
who
stole
the
debarry
plate
to
transportation
for
life
poor
dredge
had
cried
had
wished
he
never
heared
of
and
in
spite
of
sermons
from
the
jail
chaplain
fell
back
on
the
explanation
that
this
was
a
world
in
which
spratt
and
old
nick
were
sure
to
get
the
best
of
it
so
that
in
dredge
case
at
least
most
observers
must
have
had
the
melancholy
conviction
that
there
had
been
no
enhancement
of
public
spirit
and
faith
in
progress
from
that
wave
of
political
agitation
which
had
reached
the
sproxton
pits
but
curiosity
was
necessarily
at
a
higher
pitch
when
the
character
of
the
prisoner
and
the
circumstances
of
his
offence
were
of
a
highly
unusual
kind
soon
as
felix
appeared
at
the
bar
a
murmur
rose
and
spread
into
a
loud
buzz
which
continued
until
there
had
been
repeated
authoritative
calls
for
silence
in
the
court
rather
singularly
it
was
now
for
the
first
time
that
esther
had
a
feeling
of
pride
in
him
on
the
ground
simply
of
his
appearance
at
this
moment
when
he
was
the
centre
of
a
multitudinous
gaze
which
seemed
to
act
on
her
own
vision
like
a
broad
unmitigated
daylight
she
felt
that
there
was
something
in
him
notwithstanding
the
vicinity
of
numerous
gentlemen
no
would
have
admired
him
not
only
to
feminine
minds
like
tiliot
but
to
many
minds
in
coat
and
waistcoat
there
was
something
dangerous
and
perhaps
unprincipled
in
his
bare
throat
and
great
gothic
head
and
his
somewhat
massive
person
would
doubtless
have
come
out
very
oddly
from
the
hands
of
a
fashionable
tailor
of
that
time
but
as
esther
saw
his
large
gray
eyes
looking
round
calmly
and
undefiantly
first
at
the
audience
generally
and
then
with
a
more
observant
expression
at
the
lawyers
and
other
persons
immediately
around
him
she
felt
that
he
bore
the
outward
stamp
of
a
distinguished
nature
forgive
her
if
she
needed
this
satisfaction
all
of
us
whether
men
or
women
are
liable
to
this
weakness
of
liking
to
have
our
preference
justified
before
others
as
well
as
ourselves
esther
said
inwardly
with
a
certain
triumph
that
felix
holt
looked
as
worthy
to
be
chosen
in
the
midst
of
this
large
assembly
as
he
had
ever
looked
in
their
under
the
sombre
light
of
the
little
parlor
in
malthouse
yard
esther
had
felt
some
relief
in
hearing
from
her
father
that
felix
had
insisted
on
doing
without
his
mother
presence
and
since
to
holt
imagination
notwithstanding
her
general
desire
to
have
her
character
enquired
into
there
was
no
greatly
consolatory
difference
between
being
a
witness
and
a
criminal
and
an
appearance
of
any
kind
before
the
judge
could
hardly
be
made
to
suggest
anything
definite
that
would
overcome
the
dim
sense
of
unalleviated
disgrace
she
had
been
less
inclined
than
usual
to
complain
of
her
son
decision
esther
had
shuddered
beforehand
at
the
inevitable
farce
there
would
be
in
holt
testimony
but
surely
felix
would
lose
something
for
want
of
a
witness
who
could
testify
to
his
behavior
in
the
morning
before
he
became
involved
in
the
tumult
he
is
really
a
fine
young
fellow
said
harold
coming
to
speak
to
esther
after
a
colloquy
with
the
prisoner
solicitor
i
hope
he
will
not
make
a
blunder
in
defending
himself
he
is
not
likely
to
make
a
blunder
said
esther
she
had
recovered
her
color
a
little
and
was
brighter
than
she
had
been
all
the
morning
before
felix
had
seemed
to
include
her
in
his
general
glance
but
had
avoided
looking
at
her
particularly
she
understood
how
delicate
feeling
for
her
would
prevent
this
and
that
she
might
safely
look
at
him
and
toward
her
father
whom
she
could
see
in
the
same
direction
turning
to
harold
to
make
an
observation
she
saw
that
he
was
looking
toward
the
same
point
but
with
an
expression
on
his
face
that
surprised
her
dear
me
she
said
prompted
to
speak
without
any
reflection
how
angry
you
look
i
never
saw
you
look
so
angry
before
it
is
not
my
father
you
are
looking
at
oh
no
i
am
angry
at
something
i
looking
away
from
said
harold
making
an
effort
to
drive
back
the
troublesome
demon
who
would
stare
out
at
window
it
that
jermyn
he
added
glancing
at
his
mother
as
well
as
esther
he
will
thrust
himself
under
my
eyes
everywhere
since
i
refused
him
an
interview
and
returned
his
letter
i
determined
never
to
speak
to
him
directly
again
if
i
can
help
it
transome
heard
with
a
changeless
face
she
had
for
some
time
been
watching
and
had
taken
on
her
marble
look
of
immobility
she
said
an
inward
bitter
of
course
to
everything
that
was
unpleasant
after
this
esther
soon
became
impatient
of
all
speech
her
attention
was
rivetted
on
the
proceedings
of
the
court
and
on
the
mode
in
which
felix
bore
himself
in
the
case
for
the
prosecution
there
was
nothing
more
than
a
reproduction
with
irrelevancies
added
by
witnesses
of
the
facts
already
known
to
us
spratt
had
retained
consciousness
enough
in
the
midst
of
his
terror
to
swear
that
when
he
was
tied
to
the
felix
was
presiding
over
the
actions
of
the
mob
the
landlady
of
the
seven
stars
who
was
indebted
to
felix
for
rescue
from
pursuit
by
some
drunken
rioters
gave
evidence
that
went
to
prove
his
assumption
of
leadership
prior
to
the
assault
on
spratt
remembering
only
that
he
had
called
away
her
pursuers
to
better
sport
various
respectable
witnesses
swore
to
felix
encouragement
of
the
rioters
who
were
dragging
spratt
in
king
street
to
his
fatal
assault
on
tucker
and
to
his
attitude
in
front
of
the
window
at
the
manor
three
other
witnesses
gave
evidence
of
expressions
used
by
the
prisoner
tending
to
show
the
character
of
the
acts
with
which
he
was
charged
two
were
treby
tradesmen
the
third
was
a
clerk
from
duffield
the
clerk
had
heard
felix
speak
at
duffield
the
treby
men
had
frequently
heard
him
declare
himself
on
public
matters
and
they
all
quoted
expressions
which
tended
to
show
that
he
had
a
virulent
feeling
against
the
respectable
shopkeeping
class
and
that
nothing
was
likely
to
be
more
congenial
to
him
than
the
gutting
of
retailer
shops
no
one
else
knew
the
witnesses
themselves
did
not
know
fully
how
far
their
strong
perception
and
memory
on
these
points
was
due
to
a
fourth
mind
namely
that
of
john
johnson
the
attorney
who
was
nearly
related
to
one
of
the
treby
witnesses
and
a
familiar
acquaintance
of
the
duffield
clerk
man
can
not
be
defined
as
an
animal
and
in
the
difficulty
of
getting
up
evidence
on
any
subject
there
is
room
for
much
unrecognized
action
of
diligent
persons
who
have
the
extra
stimulus
of
some
private
motive
johnson
was
present
in
court
but
in
a
modest
retired
situation
he
had
come
down
to
give
information
to
jermyn
and
to
gather
information
in
other
quarters
which
was
well
illuminated
by
the
appearance
of
esther
in
company
with
the
transomes
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
closed
all
strangers
thought
that
it
looked
very
black
for
the
prisoner
in
two
instances
only
felix
had
chosen
to
put
a
question
the
first
was
to
ask
spratt
if
he
did
not
believe
that
his
having
been
tied
to
the
post
had
saved
him
from
a
probably
mortal
injury
the
second
was
to
ask
the
tradesman
who
swore
to
his
having
heard
felix
tell
the
rioters
to
leave
tucker
alone
and
come
along
with
him
whether
he
had
not
shortly
before
heard
cries
among
the
mob
summoning
to
an
attack
on
the
and
brewery
esther
had
hitherto
listened
closely
but
calmly
she
knew
that
there
would
be
this
strong
adverse
testimony
and
all
her
hopes
and
fears
were
bent
on
what
was
to
come
beyond
it
it
was
when
the
prisoner
was
asked
what
he
had
to
adduce
in
reply
that
she
felt
herself
in
the
grasp
of
that
tremor
which
does
not
disable
the
mind
but
rather
gives
keener
consciousness
of
a
mind
having
a
penalty
of
body
attached
to
it
there
was
a
silence
as
of
night
when
felix
holt
began
to
speak
his
voice
was
firm
and
clear
he
spoke
with
simple
gravity
and
evidently
without
any
enjoyment
of
the
occasion
esther
had
never
seen
his
face
look
so
weary
my
lord
i
am
not
going
to
occupy
the
time
of
the
court
with
unnecessary
words
i
believe
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
have
spoken
the
truth
as
far
as
a
superficial
observation
would
enable
them
to
do
it
and
i
see
nothing
that
can
weigh
with
the
jury
in
my
favor
unless
they
believe
my
statement
of
my
own
motives
and
the
testimony
that
certain
witnesses
will
give
to
my
character
and
purposes
as
being
inconsistent
with
my
willingly
abetting
disorder
i
will
tell
the
court
in
as
few
words
as
i
can
how
i
got
entangled
in
the
mob
how
i
came
to
attack
the
constable
and
how
i
was
led
to
take
a
course
which
seems
rather
mad
to
myself
now
i
look
back
upon
it
felix
then
gave
a
concise
narrative
of
his
motives
and
conduct
on
the
day
of
the
riot
from
the
moment
when
he
was
startled
into
quitting
his
work
by
the
earlier
uproar
of
the
morning
he
omitted
of
course
his
visit
to
malthouse
yard
and
merely
said
that
he
went
out
to
walk
again
after
returning
to
quiet
his
mother
mind
he
got
warmed
by
the
story
of
his
experience
which
moved
him
more
strongly
than
ever
now
he
recalled
it
in
vibrating
words
before
a
large
audience
of
his
the
sublime
delight
of
truthful
speech
to
one
who
has
the
great
gift
of
uttering
it
will
make
itself
felt
even
through
the
pangs
of
sorrow
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
for
myself
my
lord
i
pleaded
to
the
charge
of
manslaughter
because
i
know
that
word
may
carry
a
meaning
which
would
not
fairly
apply
to
my
act
when
i
threw
tucker
down
i
did
not
see
the
possibility
that
he
would
die
from
a
sort
of
attack
which
ordinarily
occurs
in
fighting
without
any
fatal
effect
as
to
my
assaulting
a
constable
it
was
a
quick
choice
between
two
evils
i
should
else
have
been
disabled
and
he
attacked
me
under
a
mistake
about
my
intentions
i
not
prepared
to
say
i
never
would
assault
a
constable
where
i
had
more
chance
of
deliberation
i
certainly
should
assault
him
if
i
saw
him
doing
anything
that
made
my
blood
boil
i
reverence
the
law
but
not
where
it
is
a
pretext
for
wrong
which
it
should
be
the
very
object
of
law
to
hinder
i
consider
that
i
should
be
making
an
unworthy
defence
if
i
let
the
court
infer
from
what
i
say
myself
or
from
what
is
said
by
my
witnesses
that
because
i
am
a
man
who
hates
drunken
motiveless
disorder
or
any
wanton
harm
therefore
i
am
a
man
who
would
never
fight
against
authority
i
hold
it
blasphemy
to
say
that
a
man
ought
not
to
fight
against
authority
there
is
no
great
religion
and
no
great
freedom
that
has
not
done
it
in
the
beginning
it
would
be
impertinent
for
me
to
speak
of
this
now
if
i
did
not
need
to
say
in
my
own
defence
that
i
should
hold
myself
the
worst
sort
of
traitor
if
i
put
my
hand
to
either
fighting
or
disorder
which
must
mean
to
injure
somebody
if
i
were
not
urged
to
it
by
what
i
hold
to
be
sacred
feelings
making
a
sacred
duty
either
to
my
own
manhood
or
to
my
and
certainly
felix
ended
with
a
strong
ring
of
scorn
in
his
voice
i
never
held
it
a
sacred
duty
to
try
and
get
a
radical
candidate
returned
for
north
loamshire
by
willingly
heading
a
drunken
howling
mob
whose
public
action
must
consist
in
breaking
windows
destroying
produce
and
endangering
the
lives
of
men
and
women
i
have
no
more
to
say
my
lord
i
foresaw
he
would
make
a
blunder
said
harold
in
a
low
voice
to
esther
then
seeing
her
shrink
a
little
he
feared
she
might
suspect
him
of
being
merely
stung
by
the
allusion
to
himself
i
do
mean
what
he
said
about
the
radical
candidate
he
added
hastily
in
correction
i
do
mean
the
last
sentence
i
mean
that
whole
peroration
of
his
which
he
ought
to
have
left
unsaid
it
has
done
him
harm
with
the
jury
they
wo
understand
it
or
rather
will
misunderstand
it
and
i
answer
for
it
it
has
soured
the
judge
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
we
witnesses
can
say
for
him
to
nullify
the
effect
of
what
he
has
said
for
himself
i
hope
the
attorney
has
done
his
best
in
collecting
the
evidence
i
understand
the
expense
of
the
witnesses
is
undertaken
by
some
liberals
at
glasgow
and
in
lancashire
friends
of
holt
but
i
suppose
your
father
has
told
you
the
first
witness
called
to
the
defence
was
lyon
the
gist
of
his
statements
was
that
from
the
beginning
of
september
last
till
the
day
of
the
election
he
was
in
very
frequent
intercourse
with
the
prisoner
that
he
had
become
intimately
acquainted
with
his
character
and
views
of
life
and
his
conduct
with
respect
to
the
election
and
that
these
were
totally
inconsistent
with
any
other
supposition
than
his
being
involved
in
the
riot
and
his
fatal
encounter
with
the
constable
were
due
to
the
calamitous
failure
of
a
bold
but
good
purpose
he
stated
further
that
he
had
been
present
when
an
interview
had
occurred
in
his
own
house
between
the
prisoner
and
harold
transome
who
was
then
canvassing
for
the
representation
of
north
loamshire
that
the
object
of
the
prisoner
in
seeking
this
interview
had
been
to
inform
transome
of
treating
given
in
his
name
to
the
workmen
in
the
pits
and
on
the
canal
at
sproxton
and
to
remonstrate
against
its
continuance
the
prisoner
fearing
that
disturbance
and
mischief
might
result
from
what
he
believed
to
be
the
end
toward
which
this
treating
was
directed
namely
the
presence
of
these
men
on
the
occasions
of
the
nomination
and
polling
several
times
after
this
interview
lyon
said
he
had
heard
felix
holt
recur
to
the
subject
therein
discussed
with
expressions
of
grief
and
anxiety
he
himself
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
sproxton
in
his
ministerial
capacity
he
knew
fully
what
the
prisoner
had
done
there
in
order
to
found
a
night
school
and
was
certain
that
the
prisoner
interest
in
the
workingmen
of
that
district
turned
entirely
on
the
possibility
of
converting
them
somewhat
to
habits
of
soberness
and
to
a
due
care
for
the
instruction
of
their
children
finally
he
stated
that
the
prisoner
in
compliance
with
his
request
had
been
present
at
duffield
on
the
day
of
the
nomination
and
had
on
his
return
expressed
himself
with
strong
indignation
concerning
the
employment
of
the
sproxton
men
on
that
occasion
and
what
he
called
the
wickedness
of
hiring
blind
violence
the
quaint
appearance
and
manner
of
the
little
dissenting
minister
could
not
fail
to
stimulate
the
peculiar
wit
of
the
bar
he
was
subjected
to
a
troublesome
which
he
bore
with
quietude
and
absorption
in
the
duty
of
truthful
response
on
being
asked
rather
sneeringly
if
the
prisoner
was
not
one
of
his
flock
he
answered
in
that
deeper
tone
which
made
one
of
the
most
effective
transitions
of
his
varying
voice
nay
would
to
god
he
were
i
should
then
feel
that
the
great
virtues
and
the
pure
life
i
have
beheld
in
him
were
a
witness
to
the
efficacy
of
the
faith
i
believe
in
and
the
discipline
of
the
church
whereunto
i
belong
perhaps
it
required
a
larger
power
of
comparison
than
was
possessed
by
any
of
that
audience
to
appreciate
the
moral
elevation
of
an
independent
minister
who
could
utter
those
words
nevertheless
there
was
a
murmur
which
was
clearly
one
of
sympathy
the
next
witness
and
the
one
on
whom
the
interest
of
the
spectators
was
chiefly
concentrated
was
harold
transome
there
was
a
decided
predominance
of
tory
feeling
in
the
court
and
the
human
disposition
to
enjoy
the
infliction
of
a
little
punishment
on
an
opposite
party
was
in
this
instance
of
a
tory
complexion
harold
was
keenly
alive
to
this
and
to
everything
else
that
might
prove
disagreeable
to
him
in
his
having
to
appear
in
the
but
he
was
not
likely
to
lose
his
or
to
fail
in
adjusting
himself
gracefully
under
conditions
which
most
men
would
find
it
difficult
to
carry
without
awkwardness
he
had
generosity
and
candor
enough
to
bear
felix
proud
rejection
of
his
advances
without
any
petty
resentment
he
had
all
the
susceptibilities
of
a
gentleman
and
these
moral
qualities
gave
the
right
direction
to
his
acumen
in
judging
of
the
behavior
that
would
best
secure
his
dignity
everything
requiring
was
easier
to
him
because
of
esther
presence
for
her
admiration
was
just
then
the
object
which
this
man
of
the
world
had
it
most
at
heart
to
secure
when
he
entered
the
he
was
much
admired
by
the
ladies
amongst
the
audience
many
of
whom
sighed
a
little
at
the
thought
of
his
wrong
course
in
politics
he
certainly
looked
like
a
handsome
portrait
by
sir
thomas
lawrence
in
which
that
remarkable
artist
had
happily
omitted
the
usual
excess
of
honeyed
blandness
mixed
with
alert
intelligence
which
is
hardly
compatible
with
the
state
of
man
out
of
paradise
he
stood
not
far
off
felix
and
the
two
radicals
certainly
made
a
striking
contrast
felix
might
have
come
from
the
hands
of
a
sculptor
in
the
later
roman
period
when
the
plastic
impulse
was
stirred
by
the
grandeur
of
barbaric
forms
when
rolled
collars
were
not
yet
conceived
and
satin
stocks
were
not
harold
transome
declared
he
had
had
only
one
interview
with
the
prisoner
it
was
the
interview
referred
to
by
the
previous
witness
in
whose
presence
and
in
whose
house
it
was
begun
the
interview
however
was
continued
beyond
the
observation
of
lyon
the
prisoner
and
himself
quitted
the
dissenting
minister
house
in
malthouse
yard
together
and
proceeded
to
the
office
of
jermyn
who
was
then
conducting
electioneering
business
on
his
behalf
his
object
was
to
comply
with
holt
remonstrance
by
enquiring
into
the
alleged
proceedings
at
sproxton
and
if
possible
to
put
a
stop
to
them
language
both
in
the
malthouse
yard
and
in
the
attorney
office
was
strong
he
was
evidently
indignant
and
his
indignation
turned
on
the
danger
of
employing
ignorant
men
excited
by
drink
on
an
occasion
of
popular
concourse
he
believed
that
holt
sole
motive
was
the
prevention
of
disorder
and
what
he
considered
the
demoralization
of
the
workmen
by
treating
the
event
had
certainly
justified
his
remonstrances
he
had
not
had
any
subsequent
opportunities
of
observing
the
prisoner
but
if
any
reliance
was
to
be
placed
on
a
rational
conclusion
it
must
he
thought
be
plain
that
the
anxiety
thus
manifested
by
holt
was
a
guarantee
of
the
statement
he
had
made
as
to
his
motives
on
the
day
of
the
riot
his
entire
impression
from
manner
in
that
single
interview
was
that
he
was
a
moral
and
political
enthusiast
who
if
he
sought
to
coerce
others
would
seek
to
coerce
them
into
a
difficult
and
perhaps
impracticable
scrupulosity
harold
spoke
with
as
noticeable
directness
and
emphasis
as
if
what
he
said
could
have
no
reaction
on
himself
he
had
of
course
not
entered
unnecessarily
into
what
occurred
in
jermyn
office
but
now
he
was
subjected
to
a
on
this
subject
which
gave
rise
to
some
subdued
shrugs
smiles
and
winks
among
county
gentlemen
the
questions
were
directed
so
as
to
bring
out
if
possible
some
indication
that
felix
holt
was
moved
to
his
remonstrance
by
personal
resentment
against
the
political
agents
concerned
in
setting
on
foot
the
treating
at
sproxton
but
such
questioning
is
a
sort
of
that
sometimes
hits
about
widely
the
counsel
had
close
connections
among
the
tories
of
loamshire
and
enjoyed
his
business
under
the
fire
of
various
questions
about
jermyn
and
the
agent
employed
by
him
at
sproxton
harold
got
warm
and
in
one
of
his
replies
said
with
rapid
sharpness
jermyn
was
my
agent
then
not
now
i
have
no
longer
any
but
hostile
relations
with
him
the
sense
that
he
had
shown
a
slight
heat
would
have
vexed
harold
more
if
he
had
not
got
some
satisfaction
out
of
the
thought
that
jermyn
heard
those
words
he
recovered
his
good
temper
quickly
and
when
subsequently
the
question
came
you
acquiesced
in
the
treating
of
the
sproxton
men
as
necessary
to
the
efficient
working
of
the
reformed
constituency
harold
replied
with
quiet
fluency
yes
on
my
return
to
england
before
i
put
up
for
north
loamshire
i
got
the
best
advice
from
practised
agents
both
whig
and
tory
they
all
agreed
as
to
electioneering
measures
the
next
witness
was
michael
brincey
otherwise
mike
brindle
who
gave
evidence
of
the
sayings
and
doings
of
the
prisoner
among
the
sproxton
men
mike
declared
that
felix
went
uncommon
again
drink
and
and
quarrelling
and
sich
and
was
all
for
schooling
and
bringing
up
the
little
chaps
but
on
being
he
admitted
that
he
could
give
much
account
that
felix
did
talk
again
idle
folks
whether
poor
or
rich
and
that
most
like
he
meant
the
rich
who
had
a
rights
to
be
idle
which
was
what
he
mike
liked
himself
sometimes
though
for
the
most
part
he
was
a
butty
on
being
checked
for
this
superfluous
allegation
of
his
own
theory
and
practice
mike
became
timidly
conscious
that
answering
was
a
great
mystery
beyond
the
reach
of
a
butty
soul
and
began
to
err
from
defect
instead
of
excess
however
he
reasserted
that
what
felix
most
wanted
was
to
get
to
set
up
a
school
for
the
little
chaps
with
the
two
succeeding
witnesses
who
swore
to
the
fact
that
felix
had
tried
to
lead
the
mob
along
hobb
lane
instead
of
toward
the
manor
and
to
the
violently
threatening
character
of
tucker
attack
on
him
the
case
for
the
defence
was
understood
to
close
meanwhile
esther
had
been
looking
on
and
listening
with
growing
misery
in
the
sense
that
all
had
not
been
said
which
might
have
been
said
on
behalf
of
felix
if
it
was
the
jury
who
were
to
be
acted
on
she
argued
to
herself
there
might
have
been
an
impression
made
on
their
feelings
which
would
determine
their
verdict
was
it
not
constantly
said
and
seen
that
juries
pronounced
guilty
or
not
guilty
from
sympathy
for
or
against
the
accused
she
was
too
inexperienced
to
check
her
own
argument
by
thoroughly
representing
to
herself
the
course
of
things
how
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
would
reply
and
how
the
judge
would
sum
up
with
the
object
of
cooling
down
sympathy
into
deliberation
what
she
had
painfully
pressing
on
her
inward
vision
was
that
the
trial
was
coming
to
an
end
and
that
the
voice
of
right
and
truth
had
not
been
strong
enough
when
a
woman
feels
purely
and
nobly
that
ardor
of
hers
which
breaks
through
formulas
too
rigorously
urged
on
men
by
daily
practical
needs
makes
one
of
her
most
precious
influences
she
is
the
added
impulse
that
shatters
the
stiffening
crust
of
cautious
experience
her
inspired
ignorance
gives
a
sublimity
to
actions
so
incongruously
simple
that
otherwise
they
would
make
men
smile
some
of
that
ardor
which
has
flashed
out
and
illuminated
all
poetry
and
history
was
burning
in
the
bosom
of
sweet
esther
lyon
in
this
at
least
her
woman
lot
was
perfect
that
the
man
she
loved
was
her
hero
that
her
woman
passion
and
her
reverence
for
rarest
goodness
rushed
together
in
an
undivided
current
and
they
were
making
one
danger
one
terror
one
irresistible
impulse
for
her
heart
her
feelings
were
growing
into
a
necessity
for
action
rather
than
a
resolve
to
act
she
could
not
support
the
thought
that
the
trial
would
come
to
an
end
that
sentence
would
be
passed
on
felix
and
that
all
the
while
something
had
been
omitted
which
might
have
been
said
for
him
there
had
been
no
witness
to
tell
what
had
been
his
behavior
and
state
of
mind
just
before
the
riot
she
must
do
it
it
was
possible
there
was
time
but
not
too
much
time
all
other
agitation
became
merged
in
eagerness
not
to
let
the
moment
escape
the
last
witness
was
being
called
harold
transome
had
not
been
able
to
get
back
to
her
on
leaving
the
but
lingon
was
close
by
her
with
firm
quickness
she
said
to
him
pray
tell
the
attorney
that
i
have
evidence
to
give
for
the
prisoner
lose
no
time
do
you
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
my
dear
said
lingon
looking
at
her
in
astonishment
yes
i
entreat
you
for
god
sake
said
esther
in
that
low
tone
of
urgent
beseeching
which
is
equivalent
to
a
cry
and
with
a
look
of
appeal
more
penetrating
still
i
would
rather
die
than
not
do
it
the
old
rector
always
leaning
to
the
view
of
things
felt
chiefly
that
there
seemed
to
be
an
additional
chance
for
the
poor
fellow
who
had
got
himself
into
trouble
he
disputed
no
farther
but
went
to
the
attorney
before
harold
was
aware
of
esther
intention
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
when
she
appeared
there
it
was
as
if
a
vibration
quick
as
light
had
gone
through
the
court
and
had
shaken
felix
himself
who
had
hitherto
seemed
impassive
a
sort
of
a
gleam
seemed
to
shoot
across
his
face
and
any
one
close
to
him
would
have
seen
that
his
hand
which
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
dock
trembled
at
the
first
moment
harold
was
startled
and
alarmed
the
next
he
felt
delight
in
esther
beautiful
aspect
and
in
the
admiration
of
the
court
there
was
no
blush
on
her
face
she
stood
divested
of
all
personal
considerations
whether
of
vanity
or
shyness
her
clear
voice
sounded
as
it
might
have
done
if
she
had
been
making
a
confession
of
faith
she
began
and
went
on
without
query
or
interruption
every
face
looked
grave
and
respectful
i
am
esther
lyon
the
daughter
of
lyon
the
independent
minister
at
treby
who
has
been
one
of
the
witnesses
for
the
prisoner
i
know
felix
holt
well
on
the
day
of
the
election
at
treby
when
i
had
been
much
alarmed
by
the
noises
that
reached
me
from
the
main
street
felix
holt
came
to
call
upon
me
he
knew
that
my
father
was
away
and
he
thought
that
i
should
be
alarmed
by
the
sounds
of
disturbance
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
day
and
he
came
to
tell
me
that
the
disturbance
was
quieted
and
that
the
streets
were
nearly
emptied
but
he
said
he
feared
that
the
men
would
collect
again
after
drinking
and
that
something
worse
might
happen
later
in
the
day
and
he
was
in
much
sadness
at
this
thought
he
stayed
a
little
while
and
then
he
left
me
he
was
very
melancholy
his
mind
was
full
of
great
resolutions
that
came
from
his
kind
feeling
toward
others
it
was
the
last
thing
he
would
have
done
to
join
in
riot
or
to
hurt
any
man
if
he
could
have
helped
it
his
nature
is
very
noble
he
is
he
could
never
have
had
any
intention
that
was
not
brave
and
good
there
was
something
so
naive
and
beautiful
in
this
action
of
esther
that
it
conquered
every
low
or
petty
suggestion
even
in
the
commonest
minds
the
three
men
in
that
assembly
who
knew
her
best
even
her
father
and
felix
holt
felt
a
thrill
of
surprise
mingling
with
their
admiration
this
bright
delicate
thing
that
seemed
most
like
a
toy
or
ornament
some
hand
had
touched
the
chords
and
there
came
forth
music
that
brought
tears
half
a
year
before
esther
dread
of
being
ridiculous
spread
over
the
surface
of
her
life
but
the
depth
below
was
sleeping
harold
transome
was
ready
to
give
her
his
hand
and
lead
her
back
to
her
place
when
she
was
there
felix
for
the
first
time
could
not
help
looking
toward
her
and
their
eyes
met
in
one
solemn
glance
afterward
esther
found
herself
unable
to
listen
so
as
to
form
any
judgment
on
what
she
heard
the
acting
out
of
that
strong
impulse
had
exhausted
every
energy
there
was
a
brief
pause
filled
with
a
murmur
a
buzz
and
much
coughing
the
audience
generally
felt
as
if
dull
weather
was
setting
in
again
and
under
those
auspices
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
got
up
to
make
his
reply
esther
deed
had
its
effect
beyond
the
momentary
one
but
the
effect
was
not
visible
in
the
rigid
necessities
of
legal
procedure
the
counsel
duty
of
restoring
all
unfavorable
facts
to
due
prominence
in
the
minds
of
the
jurors
had
its
effect
altogether
reinforced
by
the
of
the
judge
even
the
bare
discernment
of
facts
much
more
their
arrangement
with
a
view
to
inferences
must
carry
a
bias
human
impartiality
whether
judicial
or
not
can
hardly
escape
being
more
or
less
loaded
it
was
not
that
the
judge
had
severe
intentions
it
was
only
that
he
saw
with
severity
the
conduct
of
felix
was
not
such
as
inclined
him
to
indulgent
consideration
and
in
his
directions
to
the
jury
that
mental
attitude
necessarily
told
on
the
light
in
which
he
placed
the
homicide
even
to
many
in
the
court
who
were
not
constrained
by
judicial
duty
it
seemed
that
though
this
high
regard
felt
for
the
prisoner
by
his
friends
and
especially
by
a
woman
was
very
pretty
such
conduct
as
his
was
not
the
less
dangerous
and
foolish
and
assaulting
and
killing
a
constable
was
not
the
less
an
offence
to
be
regarded
without
leniency
esther
seemed
now
so
tremulous
and
looked
so
ill
that
harold
begged
her
to
leave
the
court
with
his
mother
and
lingon
he
would
come
and
tell
her
the
issue
but
she
said
quietly
that
she
would
rather
stay
she
was
only
a
little
overcome
by
the
exertion
of
speaking
she
was
inwardly
resolved
to
see
felix
to
the
last
moment
before
he
left
the
court
though
she
could
not
follow
the
address
of
the
counsel
or
the
judge
she
had
a
keen
ear
for
what
was
brief
and
decisive
she
heard
the
verdict
guilty
of
manslaughter
and
every
word
uttered
by
the
judge
in
pronouncing
sentence
fell
upon
her
like
an
unforgetable
sound
that
would
come
back
in
dreaming
and
in
waking
she
had
her
eyes
on
felix
and
at
the
words
imprisonment
for
four
years
she
saw
his
lip
tremble
but
otherwise
he
stood
firm
and
calm
esther
gave
a
start
from
her
seat
her
heart
swelled
with
a
horrible
sensation
of
pain
but
alarmed
lest
she
should
lose
her
she
grasped
transome
hand
getting
some
strength
from
that
human
contact
esther
saw
that
felix
had
turned
she
could
no
longer
see
his
face
yes
she
said
drawing
down
her
veil
let
us
go
chapter
xlvii
the
devil
tempts
us
not
is
we
tempt
him
beckoning
his
skill
with
opportunity
the
more
permanent
effect
of
esther
action
in
the
trial
was
visible
in
a
meeting
which
took
place
the
next
day
in
the
principal
room
of
the
white
hart
of
loamford
to
the
magistrates
and
other
county
gentlemen
who
were
drawn
together
about
noon
some
of
the
necessary
impulse
might
have
been
lacking
but
for
that
stirring
of
heart
in
certain
men
and
good
fathers
among
them
which
had
been
raised
to
a
high
pitch
of
emotion
by
esther
maidenly
fervor
among
these
one
of
the
foremost
was
sir
maximus
debarry
who
had
come
to
the
assizes
with
a
mind
as
usual
slightly
rebellious
under
an
influence
which
he
never
ultimately
resisted
the
influence
of
his
son
philip
debarry
himself
was
detained
in
london
but
in
his
correspondence
with
his
father
he
had
urged
him
as
well
as
his
uncle
augustus
to
keep
eyes
and
interest
awake
on
the
subject
of
felix
holt
whom
from
all
the
knowledge
of
the
case
he
had
been
able
to
obtain
he
was
inclined
to
believe
peculiarly
unfortunate
rather
than
guilty
philip
had
said
he
was
the
more
anxious
that
his
family
should
intervene
benevolently
in
this
affair
if
it
were
possible
because
he
understood
that
lyon
took
the
young
man
case
particularly
to
heart
and
he
should
always
regard
himself
as
obliged
to
the
old
preacher
at
this
superfineness
of
consideration
sir
maximus
had
vented
a
few
pshaws
and
in
relation
to
the
whole
affair
had
grumbled
that
phil
was
always
setting
him
to
do
he
did
know
what
always
seeming
to
turn
nothing
into
something
by
dint
of
words
which
had
so
much
substance
as
a
mote
behind
them
nevertheless
he
was
coerced
and
in
reality
he
was
willing
to
do
anything
fair
or
which
had
a
handle
that
his
understanding
could
lay
hold
of
his
brother
the
rector
desired
to
be
rigorously
just
but
he
had
come
to
loamford
with
a
severe
opinion
concerning
felix
thinking
that
some
sharp
punishment
might
be
a
wholesome
check
on
the
career
of
a
young
man
disposed
to
rely
too
much
on
his
own
crude
devices
before
the
trial
commenced
sir
maximus
had
naturally
been
one
of
those
who
had
observed
esther
with
curiosity
owing
to
the
report
of
her
inheritance
and
her
probable
marriage
to
his
once
welcome
but
now
exasperating
neighbor
harold
transome
and
he
had
made
the
emphatic
comment
a
fine
girl
something
thoroughbred
in
the
look
of
her
too
good
for
a
radical
that
all
i
have
to
say
but
during
the
trial
sir
maximus
was
wrought
into
a
state
of
sympathetic
ardor
that
needed
no
fanning
as
soon
as
he
could
take
his
brother
by
the
buttonhole
he
said
i
tell
you
what
gus
we
must
exert
ourselves
to
get
a
pardon
for
this
young
fellow
confound
it
what
the
use
of
mewing
him
up
for
four
years
example
nonsense
will
there
be
a
man
knocked
down
the
less
for
it
that
girl
made
me
cry
depend
upon
it
whether
she
going
to
marry
transome
or
not
she
been
fond
of
holt
in
her
poverty
you
know
she
a
modest
brave
beautiful
woman
i
ride
a
old
as
i
am
to
gratify
her
feelings
hang
it
the
fellow
a
good
fellow
if
she
thinks
so
and
he
threw
out
a
fine
sneer
i
thought
at
the
radical
candidate
depend
upon
it
he
a
good
fellow
at
bottom
the
rector
had
not
exactly
the
same
kind
of
ardor
nor
was
he
open
too
precisely
that
process
of
proof
which
appeared
to
have
convinced
sir
maximus
but
he
had
been
so
far
influenced
as
to
be
inclined
to
unite
in
an
effort
on
the
side
of
mercy
observing
also
that
he
knew
phil
would
be
on
that
side
and
by
the
of
similar
movements
in
the
minds
of
other
men
whose
names
were
of
weight
a
meeting
had
been
determined
on
to
consult
about
getting
up
a
memorial
to
the
home
secretary
on
behalf
of
felix
holt
his
case
had
never
had
the
sort
of
significance
that
could
rouse
political
partisanship
and
such
interest
as
was
now
felt
in
him
was
still
more
unmixed
with
that
inducement
the
gentlemen
who
gathered
in
the
room
at
the
white
hart
were
not
as
the
large
imagination
of
the
suggested
of
all
shades
of
political
opinion
but
of
as
many
shades
as
were
to
be
found
among
the
gentlemen
of
that
county
harold
transome
had
been
energetically
active
in
bringing
about
this
meeting
over
and
above
the
stings
of
conscience
and
a
determination
to
act
up
to
the
level
of
all
recognized
honorableness
he
had
the
powerful
motive
of
desiring
to
do
what
would
satisfy
esther
his
gradually
heightened
perception
that
she
had
a
strong
feeling
toward
felix
holt
had
not
made
him
uneasy
harold
had
a
conviction
that
might
have
seemed
like
fatuity
if
it
had
not
been
that
he
saw
the
effect
he
produced
on
esther
by
the
light
of
his
opinions
about
women
in
general
the
conviction
was
that
felix
holt
could
not
be
his
rival
in
any
formidable
sense
esther
admiration
for
this
eccentric
young
man
was
he
thought
a
moral
enthusiasm
a
romantic
fervor
which
was
one
among
those
many
attractions
quite
novel
in
his
own
experience
her
distress
about
the
trouble
of
one
who
had
been
a
familiar
object
in
her
former
home
was
no
more
than
naturally
followed
from
a
tender
woman
compassion
the
place
young
holt
had
held
in
her
regard
had
necessarily
changed
its
relations
now
that
her
lot
was
so
widely
changed
it
is
undeniable
that
what
most
conduced
to
the
quieting
nature
of
harold
conclusions
was
the
influence
on
his
imagination
of
the
more
or
less
detailed
reasons
that
felix
holt
was
a
watchmaker
that
his
home
and
dress
were
of
a
certain
quality
that
his
person
and
manners
that
in
short
for
harold
like
the
rest
of
us
had
many
impressions
which
saved
him
the
trouble
of
distinct
ideas
felix
holt
was
not
the
sort
of
a
man
a
woman
would
be
in
love
with
when
she
was
wooed
by
harold
transome
thus
he
was
sufficiently
at
rest
on
this
point
not
to
be
exercising
any
painful
in
acting
as
the
zealous
advocate
of
felix
cause
with
all
persons
worth
influencing
but
it
was
by
no
direct
intercourse
between
him
and
sir
maximus
that
they
found
themselves
in
for
the
old
baronet
would
not
recognize
harold
by
more
than
the
faintest
bow
and
harold
was
not
a
man
to
expose
himself
to
a
rebuff
whatever
he
in
his
inmost
soul
regarded
as
nothing
more
than
a
narrow
prejudice
he
could
defy
not
with
airs
of
importance
but
with
easy
indifference
he
could
bear
most
things
where
he
felt
that
he
had
the
superiority
the
object
of
the
meeting
was
discussed
and
the
memorial
agreed
upon
without
any
clashing
lingon
was
gone
home
but
it
was
expected
that
his
concurrence
and
signature
would
be
given
as
well
as
those
of
other
gentlemen
who
were
absent
the
business
gradually
reached
that
stage
at
which
the
concentration
of
interest
ceases
when
the
attention
of
all
but
a
few
who
are
more
practically
concerned
drops
off
and
disperses
itself
in
private
chat
and
there
is
no
longer
any
particular
reason
why
everybody
stays
except
that
everybody
is
there
the
room
was
rather
a
long
one
and
invited
to
a
little
movement
one
gentleman
drew
another
aside
to
speak
in
an
undertone
about
scotch
bullocks
another
had
something
to
say
about
the
north
loamshire
hunt
to
a
friend
who
was
the
reverse
of
but
who
nevertheless
while
listening
showed
his
strength
of
mind
by
giving
a
severe
attention
also
to
his
reflection
in
the
handsome
tall
mirror
that
filled
the
space
between
two
windows
and
in
this
way
the
groups
were
continually
shifting
but
in
the
meantime
there
were
moving
toward
this
room
at
the
white
hart
the
footsteps
of
a
person
whose
presence
had
not
been
invited
and
who
very
far
from
being
drawn
thither
by
the
belief
that
he
would
be
welcome
knew
well
that
his
entrance
would
to
one
person
at
least
be
bitterly
disagreeable
they
were
the
footsteps
of
jermyn
whose
appearance
that
morning
was
not
less
comely
and
less
carefully
tended
than
usual
but
who
was
suffering
the
torment
of
a
compressed
rage
which
if
not
impotent
to
inflict
pain
on
another
was
impotent
to
avert
evil
from
himself
after
his
interview
with
transome
there
had
been
for
some
reasons
a
delay
of
positive
procedures
against
him
by
harold
of
which
delay
jermyn
had
twice
availed
himself
first
to
seek
an
interview
with
harold
and
then
to
send
him
a
letter
the
interview
had
been
refused
and
the
letter
had
been
returned
with
the
statement
that
no
communication
could
take
place
except
through
harold
lawyers
and
yesterday
johnson
had
brought
jermyn
the
information
that
he
would
quickly
hear
of
the
proceedings
in
chancery
being
resumed
the
watch
johnson
kept
in
town
had
given
him
secure
knowledge
on
this
head
a
doomed
animal
with
every
issue
earthed
up
except
that
where
its
enemy
stands
must
if
it
has
teeth
and
fierceness
try
its
one
chance
without
delay
and
a
man
may
reach
a
point
in
his
life
in
which
his
impulses
are
not
distinguished
from
those
of
a
hunted
brute
by
any
capability
of
scruples
our
selfishness
is
so
robust
and
that
well
encouraged
it
easily
devours
all
sustenance
away
from
our
poor
little
scruples
since
harold
would
not
give
jermyn
access
to
him
that
vigorous
attorney
was
resolved
to
take
it
he
knew
all
about
the
meeting
at
the
white
hart
and
he
was
going
thither
with
the
determination
of
accosting
harold
he
thought
he
knew
what
he
should
say
and
the
tone
in
which
he
should
say
it
it
would
be
a
vague
intimation
carrying
the
effect
of
a
threat
which
should
compel
harold
to
give
him
a
private
interview
to
any
that
presented
itself
in
his
mind
to
anything
that
an
imagined
voice
might
say
the
imagined
answer
arose
that
all
very
fine
but
i
not
going
to
be
ruined
if
i
can
help
it
least
of
all
ruined
in
that
way
shall
we
call
it
degeneration
or
gradual
development
this
effect
of
thirty
additional
winters
on
the
versifying
young
jermyn
when
jermyn
entered
the
room
at
the
white
hart
he
did
not
immediately
see
harold
the
door
was
at
the
extremity
of
the
room
and
the
view
was
obstructed
by
groups
of
gentlemen
with
figures
broadened
by
overcoats
his
entrance
excited
no
particular
observation
several
persons
had
come
in
late
only
one
or
two
who
knew
jermyn
well
were
not
too
much
preoccupied
to
have
a
glancing
remembrance
of
what
had
been
chatted
about
freely
the
day
before
harold
irritated
reply
about
his
agent
from
the
witness
box
receiving
and
giving
a
slight
nod
here
and
there
jermyn
pushed
his
way
looking
round
keenly
until
he
saw
harold
standing
near
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
solicitor
who
had
acted
for
felix
was
just
then
speaking
to
him
but
having
put
a
paper
into
his
hand
turned
away
and
harold
standing
isolated
though
at
no
great
distance
from
others
bent
his
eyes
on
the
paper
he
looked
brilliant
that
morning
his
blood
was
flowing
prosperously
he
had
come
in
after
a
ride
and
was
additionally
brightened
by
rapid
talk
and
the
excitement
of
seeking
to
impress
himself
favorably
or
at
least
powerfully
on
the
minds
of
neighbors
nearer
or
more
remote
he
had
just
that
amount
of
flush
which
indicates
that
life
is
more
enjoyable
than
usual
and
as
he
stood
with
his
left
hand
caressing
his
whisker
and
his
right
holding
the
paper
and
his
his
dark
eyes
running
rapidly
along
the
written
lines
and
his
lips
reposing
in
a
curve
of
which
had
more
happiness
in
it
than
a
smile
all
beholders
might
have
seen
that
his
mind
was
at
ease
jermyn
walked
quickly
and
quietly
close
up
to
him
the
two
men
were
of
the
same
height
and
before
harold
looked
round
jermyn
voice
was
saying
close
to
his
ear
not
in
a
whisper
but
in
a
hard
incisive
disrespectful
and
yet
not
loud
tone
transome
i
must
speak
to
you
in
private
the
sound
jarred
through
harold
with
a
sensation
all
the
more
insufferable
because
of
the
revulsion
from
the
satisfied
almost
elated
state
in
which
it
had
seized
him
he
started
and
looked
round
into
jermyn
eyes
for
an
instant
which
seemed
long
there
was
no
sound
between
them
but
only
angry
hatred
gathering
in
the
two
faces
harold
felt
himself
going
to
crush
this
insolence
jermyn
felt
that
he
had
words
within
him
that
were
fangs
to
clutch
this
obstinate
strength
and
wring
forth
the
blood
and
compel
submission
and
jermyn
impulse
was
the
more
urgent
he
said
in
a
tone
that
was
rather
lower
but
yet
harder
and
more
biting
you
will
repent
else
for
your
mother
sake
at
that
sound
quick
as
a
leaping
flame
harold
had
struck
jermyn
across
the
face
with
his
whip
the
brim
of
the
hat
had
been
a
defense
jermyn
a
powerful
man
had
instantly
thrust
out
his
hand
and
clutched
harold
hard
by
the
clothes
just
below
the
throat
pushing
him
slightly
so
as
to
make
him
stagger
by
this
time
everybody
attention
had
been
called
to
this
end
of
the
room
but
both
jermyn
and
harold
were
beyond
being
arrested
by
any
consciousness
of
spectators
let
me
go
you
scoundrel
said
harold
fiercely
or
i
be
the
death
of
you
do
said
jermyn
in
a
grating
voice
am
your
in
the
thrust
by
which
harold
had
been
made
to
stagger
backward
a
little
the
two
men
had
got
very
near
the
long
mirror
they
were
both
white
both
had
anger
and
hatred
in
their
faces
the
hands
of
both
were
upraised
as
harold
heard
the
last
terrible
words
he
started
at
a
leaping
throb
that
went
through
him
and
in
the
start
turned
his
eyes
away
from
jermyn
face
he
turned
them
on
the
same
face
in
the
glass
with
his
own
beside
it
and
saw
the
hated
fatherhood
reasserted
the
strong
man
reeled
with
a
sick
faintness
but
in
the
same
moment
jermyn
released
his
hold
and
harold
felt
himself
supported
by
the
arm
it
was
sir
maximus
debarry
who
had
taken
hold
of
him
leave
the
room
sir
the
baronet
said
to
jermyn
in
a
voice
of
imperious
scorn
this
is
a
meeting
of
gentlemen
come
harold
he
said
in
the
old
friendly
voice
come
away
with
me
chapter
xlviii
is
law
as
steadfast
as
the
throne
of
zeus
our
days
are
heritors
of
days
gone
by
æschylus
a
little
after
five
that
day
harold
arrived
at
transome
court
as
he
was
winding
along
the
broad
road
of
the
park
some
parting
gleams
of
the
march
sun
pierced
the
trees
here
and
there
and
threw
on
the
grass
a
long
shadow
of
himself
and
the
groom
riding
and
illuminated
a
window
or
two
of
the
home
he
was
approaching
but
the
bitterness
in
his
mind
made
these
sunny
gleams
almost
as
odious
as
an
artificial
smile
he
wished
he
had
never
come
back
to
this
pale
english
sunshine
in
the
course
of
his
eighteen
miles
drive
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
he
understood
now
as
he
had
never
understood
before
the
neglected
solitariness
of
his
mother
life
the
allusions
and
innuendoes
which
had
come
out
during
the
election
but
with
a
proud
insurrection
against
the
hardship
of
an
ignominy
which
was
not
of
his
own
making
he
inwardly
said
that
if
the
circumstances
of
his
birth
were
such
as
to
warrant
any
man
in
regarding
his
character
of
gentleman
with
ready
suspicion
that
character
should
be
the
more
strongly
asserted
in
his
conduct
no
one
should
be
able
to
allege
with
any
show
of
proof
that
he
had
inherited
meanness
as
he
stepped
from
the
carriage
and
entered
the
hall
there
were
the
voice
and
the
trotting
feet
of
little
harry
as
usual
and
the
rush
to
clasp
his
father
leg
and
make
his
joyful
noises
harold
just
touched
the
boy
head
and
then
said
to
dominic
in
a
weary
voice
take
the
child
away
ask
where
my
mother
is
transome
dominic
said
was
he
had
seen
her
go
up
after
coming
in
from
her
walk
with
miss
lyon
and
she
had
not
come
down
again
harold
throwing
off
his
hat
and
greatcoat
went
straight
to
his
there
was
still
a
hope
in
his
mind
he
might
be
suffering
simply
from
a
lie
there
is
much
misery
created
in
the
world
by
mere
mistake
or
slander
and
he
might
have
been
stunned
by
a
lie
suggested
by
such
slander
he
rapped
at
his
mother
door
her
voice
said
immediately
come
in
transome
was
resting
in
her
as
she
often
did
between
an
afternoon
walk
and
dinner
she
had
taken
off
her
and
wrapped
herself
in
a
soft
she
was
neither
more
nor
less
empty
of
joy
than
usual
but
when
she
saw
harold
a
dreadful
certainty
took
possession
of
her
it
was
as
if
a
long
expected
letter
with
a
black
seal
had
come
at
last
harold
face
told
her
what
to
fear
the
more
decisively
because
she
had
never
before
seen
it
express
a
man
deep
agitation
since
the
time
of
its
pouting
childhood
and
careless
youth
she
had
seen
only
the
confident
strength
and
imperiousness
of
maturity
the
last
five
hours
had
made
a
change
as
great
as
illness
makes
harold
looked
as
if
he
had
been
wrestling
and
had
had
some
terrible
blow
his
eyes
had
that
sunken
look
which
because
it
is
unusual
seems
to
intensify
expression
he
looked
at
his
mother
as
he
entered
and
her
eyes
followed
him
as
he
moved
till
he
came
and
stood
in
front
of
her
she
looking
up
at
him
with
white
lips
mother
he
said
speaking
with
a
distinct
slowness
in
strange
contrast
with
his
habitual
manner
tell
me
the
truth
that
i
may
know
how
to
act
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
who
is
my
father
she
was
mute
her
lips
only
trembled
harold
stood
silent
for
a
few
moments
as
if
waiting
then
he
spoke
again
has
said
said
it
before
others
that
is
my
father
he
looked
still
at
his
mother
she
seemed
as
if
age
were
striking
her
with
a
sudden
wand
as
if
her
trembling
face
were
getting
haggard
before
him
she
was
mute
but
her
eyes
had
not
fallen
they
looked
up
in
helpless
misery
at
her
son
her
son
turned
away
his
eyes
from
her
and
left
her
in
that
moment
harold
felt
hard
he
could
show
no
pity
all
the
pride
of
his
nature
rebelled
against
his
sonship
chapter

nay

not
is
an
assured
good
to
seek
the
noblest
is
your
only
good
now
you
have
seen
it
for
that
higher
vision
poisons
all
meaner
choice
forevermore
that
day
esther
dined
with
old
transome
only
harold
sent
word
that
he
was
engaged
and
had
already
dined
and
transome
that
she
was
feeling
esther
was
much
disappointed
that
any
tidings
harold
might
have
brought
relating
to
felix
were
deferred
in
this
way
and
her
anxiety
making
her
fearful
she
was
haunted
by
the
thought
that
if
there
had
been
anything
cheering
to
tell
he
would
have
found
time
to
tell
it
without
delay
old
transome
went
as
usual
to
his
sofa
in
the
library
to
sleep
after
dinner
and
esther
had
to
seat
herself
in
the
small
in
a
solitude
that
was
unusually
dispiriting
to
her
pretty
as
this
room
was
she
did
not
like
it
portrait
being
the
only
picture
there
urged
itself
too
strongly
on
her
attention
the
youthful
brilliancy
it
represented
saddened
esther
by
its
inevitable
association
with
what
she
daily
saw
had
come
instead
of
it
a
joyless
embittered
age
the
sense
that
transome
was
unhappy
affected
esther
more
and
more
deeply
as
the
growing
familiarity
which
relaxed
the
efforts
of
the
hostess
revealed
more
and
more
the
threadbare
tissue
of
this
majestic
lady
life
even
the
flowers
and
the
pure
sunshine
and
the
sweet
waters
of
paradise
would
have
been
spoiled
for
a
young
heart
if
the
bowered
walks
had
been
haunted
by
an
eve
gone
gray
with
bitter
memories
of
an
adam
who
had
complained
the
woman
she
gave
me
of
the
tree
and
i
did
eat
and
many
of
us
know
how
even
in
our
childhood
some
blank
discontented
face
on
the
background
of
our
home
has
marred
our
summer
mornings
why
was
it
when
the
birds
were
singing
when
the
fields
were
a
garden
and
when
we
were
clasping
another
little
hand
just
larger
than
our
own
there
was
somebody
who
found
it
hard
to
smile
esther
had
got
far
beyond
that
childhood
to
a
time
and
circumstances
when
this
daily
presence
of
elderly
dissatisfaction
amidst
such
outward
things
as
she
had
always
thought
must
greatly
help
to
satisfy
awaked
not
merely
vague
questioning
emotion
but
strong
determining
thought
and
now
in
these
hours
since
her
return
from
loamford
her
mind
was
in
that
state
of
activity
that
large
discourse
in
which
we
seem
to
stand
aloof
from
our
own
life
weighing
impartially
our
own
temptations
and
the
weak
desires
that
most
habitually
solicit
us
i
think
i
am
getting
that
power
felix
wished
me
to
have
i
shall
soon
see
strong
visions
she
said
to
herself
with
a
melancholy
smile
flitting
across
her
face
as
she
put
out
her
wax
lights
that
she
might
get
rid
of
the
oppressive
urgency
of
walls
and
upholstery
and
that
portrait
smiling
with
deluded
brightness
unwitting
of
the
future
just
then
dominic
came
to
say
that
harold
sent
his
compliments
and
begged
that
she
would
grant
him
an
interview
in
his
study
he
disliked
the
small
if
she
would
oblige
him
by
going
to
the
study
at
once
he
would
join
her
very
soon
esther
went
in
some
wonder
and
anxiety
what
she
most
feared
or
hoped
in
these
moments
related
to
felix
holt
and
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
harold
could
have
anything
special
to
say
to
her
that
evening
on
other
subjects
certainly
the
study
was
pleasanter
than
the
small
a
quiet
light
shone
on
nothing
but
greenness
and
dark
wood
and
dominic
had
placed
a
delightful
chair
for
her
opposite
to
his
master
which
was
still
empty
all
the
little
objects
of
luxury
around
indicated
habitual
occupancy
and
as
esther
sat
opposite
all
these
things
along
with
the
empty
chair
which
suggested
the
coming
presence
the
expectation
of
his
beseeching
homage
brought
with
it
an
impatience
and
repugnance
which
she
had
never
felt
before
while
these
feelings
were
strongly
upon
her
the
door
opened
and
harold
appeared
he
had
recovered
his
since
his
interview
with
his
mother
he
had
dressed
and
was
perfectly
calm
he
had
been
occupied
with
resolute
thoughts
determining
to
do
what
he
knew
that
perfect
honor
demanded
let
it
cost
him
what
it
would
it
is
true
he
had
a
tacit
hope
behind
that
it
might
not
cost
him
what
he
prized
most
highly
it
is
true
he
had
a
glimpse
even
of
reward
but
it
was
not
less
true
that
he
would
have
acted
as
he
did
without
that
hope
or
glimpse
it
was
the
most
serious
moment
in
harold
transome
life
for
the
first
time
the
iron
had
entered
into
his
soul
and
he
felt
the
hard
pressure
of
our
common
lot
the
yoke
of
that
mighty
resistless
destiny
laid
upon
us
by
the
acts
of
other
men
as
well
as
our
own
when
esther
looked
at
him
she
relented
and
felt
ashamed
of
her
gratuitous
impatience
she
saw
that
his
mind
was
in
some
way
burdened
but
then
immediately
sprang
the
dread
that
he
had
to
say
something
hopeless
about
felix
they
shook
hands
in
silence
esther
looking
at
him
with
anxious
surprise
he
released
her
hand
but
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
sit
down
and
they
both
continued
standing
on
the
hearth
do
let
me
alarm
you
said
harold
seeing
that
her
face
gathered
solemnity
from
his
i
suppose
i
carry
the
marks
of
a
past
agitation
it
relates
entirely
to
troubles
of
my
own
of
my
own
family
no
one
beyond
is
involved
in
them
esther
wondered
still
more
and
felt
still
more
relenting
but
said
harold
after
a
slight
pause
and
in
a
voice
that
was
weighted
with
new
feeling
it
involves
a
difference
in
my
position
with
regard
to
you
and
it
is
on
this
point
that
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
at
once
when
a
man
sees
what
ought
to
be
done
he
had
better
do
it
forthwith
he
ca
answer
for
himself
while
esther
continued
to
look
at
him
with
eyes
widened
by
anxious
expectation
harold
turned
a
little
leaned
on
the
mantelpiece
and
ceased
to
look
at
her
as
he
spoke
my
feelings
drag
me
another
way
i
need
not
tell
you
that
your
regard
has
become
very
important
to
me
that
if
our
mutual
position
had
been
different
that
in
short
you
must
have
seen
if
it
had
not
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
worldly
interest
i
should
have
told
you
plainly
already
that
i
loved
you
and
that
my
happiness
could
be
complete
only
if
you
would
consent
to
marry
me
esther
felt
her
heart
beginning
to
beat
painfully
harold
voice
and
words
moved
her
so
much
that
her
own
task
seemed
more
difficult
than
she
had
before
imagined
it
seemed
as
if
the
silence
unbroken
by
anything
but
the
clicking
of
the
fire
had
been
long
before
harold
turned
round
toward
her
again
and
said
but
i
have
heard
something
that
affects
my
own
position
i
can
not
tell
you
what
it
is
there
is
no
need
it
is
not
any
culpability
of
my
own
but
i
have
not
just
the
same
unsullied
name
and
fame
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
around
us
as
i
believed
that
i
had
when
i
allowed
myself
to
entertain
that
wish
about
you
you
are
very
young
entering
on
a
fresh
life
with
bright
prospects
you
are
worthy
of
everything
that
is
best
i
may
be
too
vain
in
thinking
it
was
at
all
necessary
but
i
take
this
precaution
against
myself
i
shut
myself
out
from
the
chance
of
trying
after
to
induce
you
to
accept
anything
which
others
may
regard
as
specked
and
stained
by
any
obloquy
however
slight
esther
was
keenly
touched
with
a
paradoxical
longing
such
as
often
happens
to
us
she
wished
at
that
moment
that
she
could
have
loved
this
man
with
her
whole
heart
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
did
not
speak
but
with
an
angel
tenderness
in
her
face
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
harold
commanded
himself
strongly
and
said
what
is
to
be
done
now
is
that
we
should
proceed
at
once
to
the
necessary
legal
measures
for
putting
you
in
possession
of
your
own
and
arranging
mutual
claims
after
that
i
shall
probably
leave
england
esther
was
oppressed
by
an
overpowering
difficulty
her
sympathy
with
harold
at
this
moment
was
so
strong
that
it
spread
itself
like
a
mist
over
all
previous
thought
and
resolve
it
was
impossible
now
to
wound
him
afresh
with
her
hand
still
resting
on
his
arm
she
said
timidly
should
you
be
urged
obliged
to
go
in
any
case
not
in
every
case
perhaps
harold
said
with
an
evident
movement
of
the
blood
toward
his
face
at
least
not
for
long
not
for
always
esther
was
conscious
of
the
gleam
in
his
eyes
with
terror
at
herself
she
said
in
difficult
haste
i
ca
speak
i
ca
say
anything
a
great
decision
has
to
be
made
i
must
wait
till
she
was
moving
her
hand
from
his
arm
when
harold
took
it
reverentially
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
she
turned
toward
her
chair
and
as
he
released
her
hand
she
sank
down
on
the
seat
with
a
sense
that
she
needed
that
support
she
did
not
want
to
go
away
from
harold
yet
all
the
while
there
was
something
she
needed
to
know
and
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
ask
it
she
must
resign
herself
to
depend
entirely
on
his
recollection
of
anything
beyond
his
own
immediate
trial
she
sat
helpless
under
contending
sympathies
while
harold
stood
at
some
distance
from
her
feeling
more
harassed
by
weariness
and
uncertainty
now
that
he
had
fulfilled
his
resolve
and
was
no
longer
under
the
excitement
of
actually
fulfilling
it
esther
last
words
had
forbidden
his
revival
of
the
subject
that
was
necessarily
supreme
with
him
but
still
she
sat
there
and
his
mind
busy
as
to
the
probabilities
of
her
feeling
glanced
over
all
she
had
done
and
said
in
the
later
days
of
their
intercourse
it
was
this
retrospect
that
led
him
to
say
at
last
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
we
shall
get
a
very
powerfully
signed
memorial
to
the
home
secretary
about
young
holt
i
think
your
speaking
for
him
helped
a
great
deal
you
made
all
the
men
wish
what
you
wished
this
was
what
esther
had
been
yearning
to
hear
and
dared
not
ask
as
well
from
respect
for
harold
absorption
in
his
own
sorrow
as
from
the
shrinking
that
belongs
to
our
dearest
need
the
intense
relief
of
hearing
what
she
longed
to
hear
affected
her
whole
frame
her
color
her
expression
changed
as
if
she
had
been
suddenly
freed
from
some
torturing
constraint
but
we
interpret
signs
of
emotion
as
we
interpret
other
signs
often
quite
erroneously
unless
we
have
the
right
key
to
what
they
signify
harold
did
not
gather
that
this
was
what
esther
had
waited
for
or
that
the
change
in
her
indicated
more
than
he
had
expected
her
to
feel
at
this
allusion
to
an
unusual
act
which
she
had
done
under
a
strong
impulse
besides
the
introduction
of
a
new
subject
after
very
momentous
words
have
passed
and
are
still
dwelling
on
the
mind
is
necessarily
a
sort
of
concussion
shaking
us
into
a
new
adjustment
of
ourselves
it
seemed
natural
that
soon
afterward
esther
put
out
her
hand
and
said
harold
went
to
his
bedroom
on
the
same
level
with
his
study
thinking
of
the
morning
with
an
uncertainty
that
dipped
on
the
side
of
hope
this
sweet
woman
for
whom
he
felt
a
passion
newer
than
any
he
had
expected
to
feel
might
possibly
make
some
hard
things
more
bearable
if
she
loved
him
if
not
well
he
had
acted
so
that
he
could
defy
anyone
to
say
he
was
not
a
gentleman
esther
went
to
her
bedroom
thinking
that
she
should
not
sleep
that
night
she
set
her
light
on
a
high
stand
and
did
not
touch
her
dress
what
she
desired
to
see
with
undisturbed
clearness
were
things
not
present
the
rest
she
needed
was
the
rest
of
a
final
choice
it
was
difficult
on
each
side
there
was
renunciation
she
drew
up
her
blinds
liking
to
see
the
gray
sky
where
there
were
some
veiled
glimmerings
of
moonlight
and
the
lines
of
the
forever
running
river
and
the
bending
movement
of
the
black
trees
she
wanted
the
largeness
of
the
world
to
help
her
thought
this
young
creature
who
trod
lightly
backward
and
forward
and
leaned
against
the
and
shook
back
her
brown
curls
as
she
looked
at
something
not
visible
had
lived
hardly
more
than
six
months
since
she
saw
felix
holt
for
the
first
time
but
life
is
measured
by
the
rapidity
of
change
the
succession
of
influences
that
modify
the
being
and
esther
had
undergone
something
little
short
of
an
inward
revolution
the
revolutionary
struggle
however
was
not
quite
at
an
end
there
was
something
which
she
now
felt
profoundly
to
be
the
best
thing
that
life
could
give
her
but
if
it
was
to
be
had
at
all
it
was
not
to
be
had
without
paying
a
heavy
price
for
it
such
as
we
must
pay
for
all
that
is
greatly
good
a
supreme
love
a
motive
that
gives
a
sublime
rhythm
to
a
woman
life
and
exalts
habit
into
partnership
with
the
soul
highest
needs
is
not
to
be
had
where
and
how
she
wills
to
know
that
high
initiation
she
must
often
tread
where
it
is
hard
to
tread
and
feel
the
chill
air
and
watch
through
darkness
it
is
not
true
that
love
makes
all
things
easy
it
makes
us
choose
what
is
difficult
esther
previous
life
had
brought
her
into
close
acquaintance
with
many
negations
and
with
many
positive
ills
too
not
of
the
acutely
painful
but
of
the
distasteful
sort
what
if
she
chose
the
hardship
and
had
to
bear
it
alone
with
no
strength
to
lean
upon
no
other
better
self
to
make
a
place
for
trust
and
joy
her
past
experience
saved
her
from
illusions
she
knew
the
dim
life
of
the
back
street
the
contact
with
sordid
vulgarity
the
lack
of
refinement
for
the
senses
the
summons
to
a
daily
task
and
the
gain
that
was
to
make
that
life
of
privation
something
on
which
she
dreaded
to
turn
her
back
as
if
it
were
heaven
the
presence
and
the
love
of
felix
holt
was
only
a
quivering
hope
not
a
certainty
it
was
not
in
her
woman
nature
that
the
hope
should
not
spring
within
her
and
make
a
strong
impulse
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
had
he
not
said
how
a
woman
might
help
a
man
if
she
were
worthy
and
if
she
proved
herself
worthy
but
still
there
was
the
dread
that
after
all
she
might
find
herself
on
the
stony
road
alone
and
faint
and
be
weary
even
with
the
fulfillment
of
her
hope
she
knew
that
she
pledged
herself
to
meet
high
demands
and
on
the
other
side
there
was
a
lot
where
everything
seemed
easy
but
for
the
fatal
absence
of
those
feelings
which
now
she
had
once
known
them
it
seemed
nothing
less
than
a
fall
and
degradation
to
do
without
with
a
terrible
prescience
which
a
multitude
of
impressions
during
her
stay
at
transome
court
had
contributed
to
form
she
saw
herself
in
a
silken
bondage
that
arrested
all
motive
and
was
nothing
better
than
a
despair
to
be
restless
amidst
ease
to
be
languid
among
all
appliances
for
pleasure
was
a
possibility
that
seemed
to
haunt
the
rooms
of
this
house
and
wander
with
her
under
the
oaks
and
elms
of
the
park
and
harold
transome
love
no
longer
a
hovering
fancy
with
which
she
played
but
become
a
serious
fact
seemed
to
threaten
her
with
a
stifling
oppression
the
homage
of
a
man
may
be
delightful
until
he
asks
straight
for
love
by
which
a
woman
renders
homage
since
she
and
felix
had
kissed
each
other
in
the
prison
she
felt
as
if
she
had
vowed
herself
away
as
if
memory
lay
on
her
lips
like
a
seal
of
possession
yet
what
had
happened
that
very
evening
had
strengthened
her
liking
for
harold
and
her
care
for
all
that
regarded
him
it
had
increased
her
repugnance
to
turning
him
out
of
anything
he
had
expected
to
be
his
or
to
snatching
anything
from
him
on
the
ground
of
an
arbitrary
claim
it
had
even
made
her
dread
as
a
coming
pain
the
task
of
saying
anything
to
him
that
was
not
a
promise
of
the
utmost
comfort
under
this
trouble
of
his
it
was
already
near
midnight
but
with
these
thoughts
succeeding
and
returning
in
her
mind
like
scenes
through
which
she
was
living
esther
had
a
more
intense
wakefulness
than
any
she
had
known
by
day
all
had
been
stillness
hitherto
except
the
fitful
wind
outside
but
her
ears
now
caught
a
sound
within
slight
but
sudden
she
moved
near
her
door
and
heard
the
sweep
of
something
on
the
matting
outside
it
came
closer
and
paused
then
it
began
again
and
seemed
to
sweep
away
from
her
then
it
approached
and
paused
as
it
had
done
before
esther
listened
wondering
the
same
thing
happened
again
and
again
till
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
opened
the
door
and
in
the
dim
light
of
the
corridor
where
the
glass
above
seemed
to
make
a
glimmering
sky
she
saw
transome
tall
figure
pacing
slowly
with
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
chapter
the
great
question
in
life
is
the
suffering
we
cause
and
the
utmost
ingenuity
of
metaphysics
can
not
justify
the
man
who
has
pierced
the
heart
that
loved
him
benjamin
constant
when
denner
had
gone
up
to
her
mistress
room
to
dress
her
for
dinner
she
had
found
her
seated
just
as
harold
had
found
her
only
with
eyelids
drooping
and
trembling
over
tears
nay
with
a
face
in
which
every
sensitive
feature
every
muscle
seemed
to
be
quivering
with
a
silent
endurance
of
some
agony
denner
went
and
stood
by
the
chair
a
minute
without
speaking
only
laying
her
hand
gently
on
transome
at
last
she
said
beseechingly
pray
speak
madam
what
has
happened
the
worst
denner
the
worst
you
are
let
me
undress
you
and
put
you
to
bed
no
i
am
not
ill
i
am
not
going
to
die

shall
live
i
shall
live
what
may
i
do
go
and
say
i
shall
not
dine
then
you
may
come
back
if
you
will
the
patient
came
back
and
sat
by
her
mistress
in
motionless
silence
transome
would
not
let
her
dress
be
touched
and
waved
away
all
proffers
with
a
slight
movement
of
her
hand
denner
dared
not
even
light
a
candle
without
being
told
at
last
when
the
evening
was
far
gone
transome
said
go
down
denner
and
find
out
where
harold
is
and
come
back
and
tell
me
shall
i
ask
him
to
come
to
you
madam
no
do

to
do
it
if
you
love

denner
brought
word
that
harold
was
in
his
study
and
that
miss
lyon
was
with
him
he
had
not
dined
but
had
sent
later
to
ask
miss
lyon
to
go
into
his
study
light
the
candles
and
leave
me
may
i
come
again
no
it
may
be
that
my
son

the
little
bed
in
your
bedroom

that
the
hardest
word
of
all
madam
the
time
will
come
but
not
now
kiss
me
now
go
the
small
quiet
old
woman
obeyed
as
she
had
always
done
she
shrank
from
seeming
to
claim
an
equal
share
in
her
mistress
sorrow
for
two
hours
transome
mind
hung
on
what
was
hardly
a
hope
hardly
more
than
the
listening
for
a
bare
possibility
she
began
to
create
the
sounds
that
her
anguish
craved
to
hear
began
to
imagine
a
footfall
and
a
hand
upon
the
door
then
checked
by
continual
disappointment
she
tried
to
rouse
a
truer
consciousness
by
rising
from
her
seat
and
walking
to
her
window
where
she
saw
streaks
of
light
moving
and
disappearing
on
the
grass
and
heard
the
sound
of
bolts
and
closing
doors
she
hurried
away
and
threw
herself
into
her
seat
again
and
buried
her
head
in
the
deafening
down
of
the
cushions
there
was
no
sound
of
comfort
to
her
then
her
heart
cried
out
within
her
against
the
cruelty
of
this
son
when
he
turned
from
her
in
the
first
moment
he
had
not
had
time
to
feel
anything
but
the
blow
that
had
fallen
on
himself
but
afterward
was
it
possible
that
he
should
not
be
touched
with
a
son
pity
was
it
possible
that
he
should
not
have
been
visited
by
some
thought
of
the
long
years
through
which
she
had
suffered
the
memory
of
those
years
came
back
to
her
now
with
a
protest
against
the
cruelty
that
had
all
fallen
on
she
started
up
with
a
new
restlessness
from
this
spirit
of
resistance
she
was
not
penitent
she
had
borne
too
hard
a
punishment
always
the
edge
of
calamity
had
fallen
on
who
had
felt
for
her
she
was
desolate
god
had
no
pity
else
her
son
would
not
have
been
so
hard
what
dreary
future
was
there
after
this
dreary
past
she
too
looked
out
into
the
dim
night
but
the
black
boundary
of
trees
and
the
long
line
of
the
river
seemed
only
part
of
the
loneliness
and
monotony
of
her
life
suddenly
she
saw
a
light
on
the
stone
balustrades
of
the
balcony
that
projected
in
front
of
esther
window
and
the
flash
of
a
moving
candle
falling
on
a
shrub
below
esther
was
still
awake
and
up
what
had
harold
told
her
what
had
passed
between
them
harold
was
fond
of
this
young
creature
who
had
been
always
sweet
and
reverential
to
her
there
was
mercy
in
her
young
heart
she
might
be
a
daughter
who
had
no
impulse
to
punish
and
to
strike
her
whom
fate
had
stricken
on
the
dim
loneliness
before
her
she
seemed
to
see
esther
gentle
look
it
was
possible
still
that
the
misery
of
this
night
might
be
broken
by
some
comfort
the
proud
woman
yearned
for
the
caressing
pity
that
must
dwell
in
that
young
bosom
she
opened
her
door
gently
but
when
she
had
reached
esther
she
hesitated
she
had
never
yet
in
her
life
asked
for
compassion
had
never
thrown
herself
in
faith
on
an
unproffered
love
and
she
might
have
gone
on
pacing
the
corridor
like
an
uneasy
spirit
without
a
goal
if
thought
leaping
toward
her
had
not
saved
her
from
the
need
to
ask
admission
transome
was
walking
toward
the
door
when
it
opened
as
esther
saw
that
image
of
restless
misery
it
blent
itself
by
a
rapid
flash
with
all
that
harold
had
said
in
the
evening
she
divined
that
the
son
new
trouble
must
be
one
with
the
mother
long
sadness
but
there
was
no
waiting
in
an
instant
transome
felt
esther
arm
round
her
neck
and
a
voice
saying
softly
oh
why
did
you
call
me
before
they
turned
hand
and
hand
into
the
room
and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
disordered
gray
hair
the
haggard
face
the
reddened
eyelids
under
which
the
tears
seemed
to
be
coming
again
with
pain
pierced
esther
to
the
heart
a
passionate
desire
to
soothe
this
suffering
woman
came
over
her
she
clung
round
her
again
and
kissed
her
poor
quivering
lips
and
eyelids
and
laid
her
young
cheek
against
the
pale
and
haggard
one
words
could
not
be
quick
or
strong
enough
to
utter
her
yearning
as
transome
felt
that
soft
clinging
she
said
god
has
some
pity
on
me
rest
on
my
bed
said
esther
you
are
so
tired
i
will
cover
you
up
warmly
and
then
you
will
sleep
no
tell
me
dear
tell
me
what
harold
said
that
he
has
had
some
new
trouble
he
said
nothing
hard
about
me
no
nothing
he
did
not
mention
you
i
have
been
an
unhappy
woman
dear
i
feared
it
said
esther
pressing
her
gently
men
are
selfish
they
are
selfish
and
cruel
what
they
care
for
is
their
own
pleasure
and
their
own
pride
not
all
said
esther
on
whom
these
words
fell
with
a
painful
jar
all
i
have
ever
loved
said
transome
she
paused
a
moment
or
two
and
then
said
for
more
than
twenty
years
i
have
not
had
an
happiness
harold
knows
it
and
yet
he
is
hard
to
me
he
will
not
be
he
will
not
be
i
am
sure
he
will
be
good
said
esther
pleadingly
remember
he
said
to
me
his
trouble
was
new
he
has
not
had
time
it
is
too
hard
to
bear
dear
transome
said
a
new
sob
rising
as
she
clung
fast
to
esther
in
return
i
am
old
and
expect
so
little
now
a
very
little
thing
would
seem
great
why
should
i
be
punished
any
more
esther
found
it
difficult
to
speak
the
tragedy
of
this
woman
life
the
dreary
waste
of
years
empty
of
sweet
trust
and
affection
afflicted
her
even
to
horror
it
seemed
to
have
come
as
a
last
vision
to
urge
her
toward
the
life
where
the
draughts
of
joy
sprang
from
the
unchanging
fountains
of
reverence
and
devout
love
but
all
the
more
she
longed
to
still
the
pain
of
this
heart
that
beat
against
hers
do
let
me
go
to
your
own
room
with
you
and
let
me
undress
you
and
let
me
tend
upon
you
she
said
with
a
woman
gentle
instinct
it
will
be
a
very
great
thing
to
me
i
shall
seem
to
have
a
mother
again
do
let
me
transome
yielded
at
last
and
let
esther
soothe
her
with
a
daughter
tendance
she
was
undressed
and
went
to
bed
and
at
last
dozed
fitfully
with
frequent
starts
but
esther
watched
by
her
till
the
chills
of
morning
came
and
then
she
only
wrapped
more
warmth
around
her
and
slept
fast
in
the
chair
till
denner
movement
in
the
room
roused
her
she
started
out
of
a
dream
in
which
she
was
telling
felix
what
had
happened
to
her
that
night
transome
was
now
in
the
sounder
morning
sleep
which
sometimes
comes
after
a
long
night
of
misery
esther
beckoned
denner
into
the
and
said
it
is
late
hickes
do
you
think
harold
is
out
of
his
room
yes
a
long
while
he
was
out
earlier
than
usual
will
you
ask
him
to
come
up
here
say
i
begged
you
when
harold
entered
esther
was
leaning
against
the
back
of
the
empty
chair
where
yesterday
he
had
seen
his
mother
sitting
he
was
in
a
state
of
wonder
and
suspense
and
when
esther
approached
him
and
gave
him
her
hand
he
said
in
a
startled
way
good
god
how
ill
you
look
have
you
been
sitting
up
with
my
mother
yes
she
is
asleep
now
said
esther
they
had
merely
pressed
hands
by
way
of
greeting
and
now
stood
apart
looking
at
each
other
solemnly
has
she
told
you
anything
said
harold
no
only
that
she
is
wretched
oh
i
think
i
would
bear
a
great
deal
of
unhappiness
to
save
her
from
having
any
more
a
painful
thrill
passed
through
harold
and
showed
itself
in
his
face
with
that
pale
rapid
flash
which
can
never
be
painted
esther
pressed
her
hands
together
and
said
timidly
though
it
was
from
an
urgent
prompting
there
is
nothing
in
all
this
place
nothing
since
ever
i
came
here
i
could
care
for
so
much
as
that
you
should
sit
down
by
her
now
and
that
she
should
see
you
when
she
wakes
then
with
delicate
instinct
she
added
just
laying
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
i
know
you
would
have
come
i
know
you
meant
it
but
she
is
asleep
now
go
gently
before
she
wakes
harold
just
laid
his
right
hand
for
an
instant
on
the
back
of
as
it
rested
on
his
sleeve
and
then
stepped
softly
to
his
bedside
an
hour
afterward
when
harold
had
laid
his
mother
pillow
afresh
and
sat
down
again
by
her
she
said
if
that
dear
thing
will
marry
you
harold
it
will
make
up
to
you
for
a
great
deal
but
before
the
day
closed
harold
knew
that
this
was
not
to
be
that
young
presence
which
had
flitted
like
a
white
dove
over
all
the
saddening
relics
and
new
finery
of
transome
court
could
not
find
its
home
there
harold
heard
from
esther
lips
that
she
loved
some
one
else
and
that
she
resigned
all
claim
to
the
transome
estates
she
wished
to
go
back
to
her
father

the
maiden
said
i
wis
the
londe
is
very
fair
to
see
but
my
that
is
in
bonde
is
fairer
still
to
me
one
april
day
when
the
sun
shone
on
the
lingering
raindrops
lyddy
was
gone
out
and
esther
chose
to
sit
in
the
kitchen
in
the
against
the
white
table
between
the
fire
and
the
window
the
kettle
was
singing
and
the
clock
was
ticking
steadily
toward
four
she
was
not
reading
but
stitching
and
as
her
fingers
moved
nimbly
something
played
about
her
parted
lips
like
a
ray
suddenly
she
laid
down
her
work
pressed
her
hands
together
on
her
knees
and
bent
forward
a
little
the
next
moment
there
came
a
loud
rap
at
the
door
she
started
up
and
opened
it
but
kept
herself
hidden
behind
it
lyon
at
home
said
felix
in
his
firm
tones
no
sir
said
esther
from
behind
her
screen
but
miss
lyon
is
if
you
please
to
walk
in
esther
exclaimed
felix
amazed
they
held
each
other
by
both
hands
and
looked
into
each
other
faces
with
delight
you
are
out
of
prison
yes
till
i
do
something
bad
again
but
you
how
is
it
all
oh
it
is
said
esther
smiling
brightly
as
she
moved
toward
the
wicker
chair
and
seated
herself
again
that
everything
is
as
usual
my
father
is
gone
to
see
the
sick
lyddy
is
gone
in
deep
despondency
to
buy
the
grocery
and
i
am
sitting
here
with
some
vanity
in
me
needing
to
be
scolded
felix
had
seated
himself
on
a
chair
that
happened
to
be
near
her
at
the
corner
of
the
table
he
looked
at
her
still
with
questioning
eyes
he
grave
she
mischievously
smiling
are
you
come
back
to
live
here
then
yes
you
are
not
going
to
be
married
to
harold
transome
or
to
be
rich
no
something
made
esther
take
up
her
work
again
and
begin
to
stitch
the
smiles
were
dying
into
a
tremor
why
said
felix
in
rather
a
low
tone
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
while
he
looked
at
her
i
did
not
wish
to
marry
him
or
to
be
rich
you
have
given
it
all
up
said
felix
leaning
forward
a
little
and
speaking
in
a
still
lower
tone
esther
did
not
speak
they
heard
the
kettle
singing
and
the
clock
loudly
ticking
there
was
no
knowing
how
it
was
esther
work
fell
their
eyes
met
and
the
next
instant
their
arms
were
round
each
other
necks
and
once
more
they
kissed
each
other
when
their
hands
fell
again
their
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
felix
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
could
you
share
the
life
of
a
poor
man
then
esther
if
i
thought
well
enough
of
him
she
said
the
smile
coming
again
with
the
pretty
saucy
movement
of
her
head
have
you
considered
well
what
it
would
be
that
it
would
be
a
very
bare
and
simple
life
yes
without
atta
of
rose
felix
suddenly
removed
his
hand
from
her
shoulder
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
a
step
or
two
then
he
turned
round
and
said
with
deep
gravity
and
the
people
i
shall
live
among
esther
they
have
not
just
the
same
follies
and
vices
as
the
rich
but
they
have
their
own
forms
of
folly
and
vice
and
they
have
not
what
are
called
the
refinements
of
the
rich
to
make
their
faults
more
bearable
i
do
say
more
bearable
to
me
not
fond
of
those
refinements
but
you
are
felix
paused
an
instant
and
then
added
it
is
very
serious
esther
i
know
it
is
serious
said
esther
looking
up
at
him
since
i
have
been
at
transome
court
i
have
seen
many
things
very
seriously
if
i
had
not
i
should
not
have
left
what
i
did
leave
i
made
a
deliberate
choice
felix
stood
a
moment
or
two
dwelling
on
her
with
a
face
where
the
gravity
gathered
tenderness
and
these
curls
he
said
with
a
sort
of
relenting
seating
himself
again
and
putting
his
hand
on
them
they
cost
nothing
they
are
natural
you
are
such
a
delicate
creature
i
am
very
healthy
poor
women
i
think
are
healthier
than
the
rich
besides
esther
went
on
with
a
mischievous
meaning
i
think
of
having
some
wealth
how
said
felix
with
an
anxious
start
what
do
you
mean
i
think
even
of
two
pounds
a
week
one
need
live
up
to
the
splendor
of
all
that
you
know
we
might
live
as
simply
as
you
liked
there
would
be
money
to
spare
and
you
could
do
wonders
and
be
obliged
to
work
too
only
not
if
sickness
came
and
then
i
think
of
a
little
income
for
your
mother
enough
for
her
to
live
as
she
has
been
used
to
live
and
a
little
income
for
my
father
to
save
him
from
being
dependent
when
he
is
no
longer
able
to
preach
esther
said
all
this
in
a
playful
tone
but
she
ended
with
a
grave
look
of
appealing
submission
i
mean
if
you
approve
i
wish
to
do
what
you
think
it
will
be
right
to
do
felix
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
again
and
reflected
a
little
while
looking
on
the
hearth
then
he
said
lifting
up
his
eyes
with
a
smile
at
her
why
i
shall
be
able
to
set
up
a
great
library
and
lend
the
books
to
be
and
marked
with
esther
said
laughing
you
think
you
are
to
be
everything
you
know
how
clever
i
am
i
mean
to
go
on
teaching
a
great
many
things
teaching
me
oh
yes
she
said
with
a
little
toss
i
shall
improve
your
french
accent
you
wo
want
me
to
wear
a
stock
said
felix
with
a
defiant
shake
of
the
head
no
and
you
will
not
attribute
stupid
thoughts
to
me
before
uttered
them
they
laughed
merrily
each
holding
the
other
arms
like
girl
and
boy
there
was
the
ineffable
sense
of
youth
in
common
then
felix
leaned
forward
that
their
lips
might
meet
again
and
after
that
his
eyes
roved
tenderly
over
her
face
and
curls
i
a
rough
severe
fellow
esther
shall
you
never
repent
never
be
inwardly
reproaching
me
that
i
was
not
a
man
who
could
have
shared
your
wealth
are
you
quite
sure
quite
sure
said
esther
shaking
her
head
for
then
i
should
have
honored
you
less
i
am
weak
my
husband
must
be
greater
and
nobler
than
i
am
oh
i
tell
you
what
though
said
felix
starting
up
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
creasing
his
brow
playfully
if
you
take
me
in
that
way
i
shall
be
forced
to
be
a
much
better
fellow
than
i
ever
thought
of
being
i
call
that
retribution
said
esther
with
a
laugh
as
sweet
as
the
morning
thrush
epilogue
our
finest
hope
is
finest
memory
and
those
who
love
in
age
think
youth
is
happy
because
it
has
a
life
to
fill
with
love
the
very
next
may
felix
and
esther
were
married
every
one
in
those
days
was
married
at
the
parish
church
but
lyon
was
not
satisfied
without
an
additional
private
solemnity
wherein
there
was
no
bondage
to
questionable
forms
so
that
he
might
have
a
more
enlarged
utterance
of
joy
and
supplication
it
was
a
very
simple
wedding
but
no
wedding
even
the
gayest
ever
raised
so
much
interest
and
debate
in
treby
magna
even
very
great
people
like
sir
maximus
and
his
family
went
to
the
church
to
look
at
this
bride
who
had
renounced
wealth
and
chosen
to
be
the
wife
of
a
man
who
said
he
would
always
be
poor
some
few
shook
their
heads
could
not
quite
believe
it
and
thought
there
was
more
behind
but
the
majority
of
honest
trebians
were
affected
somewhat
in
the
same
way
as
wace
was
who
observed
to
his
wife
as
they
walked
from
under
the
churchyard
chestnuts
it
wonderful
how
things
go
through
you
you
do
know
how
i
feel
somehow
as
if
i
believed
more
in
everything
that
good
holt
that
day
said
she
felt
herself
to
be
receiving
some
reward
implying
that
justice
certainly
had
much
more
in
reserve
little
job
tudge
had
an
entirely
new
suit
of
which
he
fingered
every
separate
brass
button
in
a
way
that
threatened
an
arithmetical
mania
and
holt
had
out
her
best
and
put
down
her
carpet
again
with
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
there
would
no
more
be
boys
coming
in
all
weathers
with
dirty
shoes
for
felix
and
esther
did
not
take
up
their
abode
in
treby
magna
and
after
a
while
lyon
left
the
town
too
and
joined
them
where
they
dwelt
on
his
resignation
the
church
in
malthouse
yard
chose
a
successor
to
him
whose
doctrine
was
rather
higher
there
were
other
departures
from
treby
jermyn
establishment
was
broken
up
and
he
was
understood
to
have
gone
to
reside
at
a
great
distance
some
said
abroad
that
large
home
of
ruined
reputations
johnson
continued
blonde
and
sufficiently
prosperous
till
he
got
gray
and
rather
more
prosperous
some
persons
who
did
not
think
highly
of
him
held
that
his
prosperity
was
a
fact
to
be
kept
in
the
background
as
being
dangerous
to
the
morals
of
the
young
judging
that
it
was
not
altogether
creditable
to
the
divine
providence
that
anything
but
virtue
should
be
rewarded
by
a
front
and
back
in
bedford
row
as
for
christian
he
had
no
more
profitable
secrets
at
his
disposal
but
he
got
his
thousand
pounds
from
harold
transome
the
transome
family
were
absent
some
time
from
transome
court
the
place
was
kept
up
and
shown
to
visitors
but
not
by
denner
who
was
away
with
her
mistress
after
a
while
the
family
came
back
and
transome
died
there
sir
maximus
was
at
her
funeral
and
throughout
that
neighborhood
there
was
silence
about
the
past
uncle
lingon
continued
to
watch
over
the
shooting
on
the
manor
and
the
covers
until
that
event
occurred
which
he
had
predicted
as
a
part
of
church
reform
sure
to
come
little
treby
had
a
new
rector
but
others
were
sorry
besides
the
old
pointers
as
to
all
that
wide
parish
of
treby
magna
it
has
since
prospered
as
the
rest
of
england
has
prospered
doubtless
there
is
more
enlightenment
now
whether
the
farmers
are
all
the
shopkeepers
nobly
independent
the
sproxton
men
entirely
sober
and
judicious
the
dissenters
quite
without
narrowness
or
asperity
in
religion
and
politics
and
the
publicans
all
fit
like
gaius
to
be
the
friends
of
an
apostle
these
things
i
have
not
heard
not
having
correspondence
in
those
parts
whether
any
presumption
may
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
north
loamshire
does
not
yet
return
a
radical
candidate
i
leave
to
the
i
mean
the
newspapers
as
to
the
town
in
which
felix
holt
now
resides
i
will
keep
that
a
secret
lest
he
should
be
troubled
by
any
visitor
having
the
insufferable
motive
of
curiosity
i
will
only
say
that
esther
has
never
repented
felix
however
grumbles
a
little
that
she
has
made
his
life
too
easy
and
that
if
it
were
not
for
much
walking
he
should
be
a
sleek
dog
there
is
a
young
felix

has
