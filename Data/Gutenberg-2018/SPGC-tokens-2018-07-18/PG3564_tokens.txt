the

napoleon
was
scarcely
reseated
on
his
throne
when
he
found
he
could
not
resume
that
absolute
power
he
had
possessed
before
his
abdication
at
fontainebleau
he
was
obliged
to
submit
to
the
curb
of
a
representative
government
but
we
may
well
believe
that
he
only
yielded
with
a
mental
reservation
that
as
soon
as
victory
should
return
to
his
standards
and
his
army
be
reorganised
he
would
send
the
representatives
of
the
people
back
to
their
departments
and
make
himself
as
absolute
as
he
had
ever
been
his
temporary
submission
was
indeed
obligatory
the
republicans
and
constitutionalists
who
had
assisted
or
not
opposed
his
return
with
carnot
fouche
benjamin
constant
and
his
own
brother
lucien
a
lover
of
constitutional
liberty
at
their
head
would
support
him
only
on
condition
of
his
reigning
as
a
constitutional
sovereign
he
therefore
proclaimed
a
constitution
under
the
title
of
acte
additionnel
aux
constitutions
de
which
greatly
resembled
the
charter
granted
by
louis
xviii
the
year
before
an
hereditary
chamber
of
peers
was
to
be
appointed
by
the
emperor
a
chamber
of
representatives
chosen
by
the
electoral
colleges
to
be
renewed
every
five
years
by
which
all
taxes
were
to
be
voted
ministers
were
to
be
responsible
judges
irremovable
the
right
of
petition
was
acknowledged
and
property
was
declared
inviolable
lastly
the
french
nation
was
made
to
declare
that
they
would
never
recall
the
bourbons
even
before
reaching
paris
and
while
resting
on
his
journey
from
elba
at
lyons
the
second
city
in
france
and
the
ancient
capital
of
the
franks
napoleon
arranged
his
ministry
and
issued
sundry
decrees
which
show
how
little
his
mind
was
prepared
for
proceeding

to
the
majority
of
votes

a
boon
to
the
revolutionists
davoust
appointed
minister
of
war
decrees
upon
decrees
were
issued
with
a
rapidity
which
showed
how
laboriously
bonaparte
had
employed
those
studious
hours
at
elba
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
dedicated
to
the
composition
of
his
memoirs
they
were
couched
in
the
name
of
napoleon
by
the
grace
of
god
emperor
of
france
and
were
dated
on
the
of
march
although
not
promulgated
until
the
of
that
month
the
first
of
these
decrees
abrogated
all
changes
in
the
courts
of
justice
and
tribunals
which
had
taken
place
during
the
absence
of
napoleon
the
second
banished
anew
all
emigrants
who
had
returned
to
france
before
without
proper
authority
and
displaced
all
officers
belonging
to
the
class
of
emigrants
introduced
into
the
army
by
the
king
the
third
suppressed
the
order
of
louis
the
white
flag
cockade
and
other
royal
emblems
and
restored
the
banner
and
the
imperial
symbols
of
bonaparte
authority
the
same
decree
abolished
the
swiss
guard
and
the
household
troops
of
the
king
the
fourth
sequestered
the
effects
of
the
bourbons
a
similar
ordinance
sequestered
the
restored
property
of
emigrant
families
the
fifth
decree
of
lyons
suppressed
the
ancient
nobility
and
feudal
titles
and
formally
confirmed
proprietors
of
national
domains
in
their
possessions
this
decree
was
very
acceptable
to
the
majority
of
frenchmen
the
sixth
declared
sentence
of
exile
against
all
emigrants
not
erased
by
napoleon
from
the
list
previously
to
the
accession
of
the
bourbons
to
which
was
added
confiscation
of
their
property
the
seventh
restored
the
legion
of
honour
in
every
respect
as
it
had
existed
under
the
emperor
uniting
to
its
funds
the
confiscated
revenues
of
the
bourbon
order
of
louis
the
eighth
and
last
decree
was
the
most
important
of
all
under
pretence
that
emigrants
who
had
borne
arms
against
france
had
been
introduced
into
the
chamber
of
peers
and
that
the
chamber
of
deputies
had
already
sat
for
the
legal
time
it
dissolved
both
chambers
and
convoked
the
electoral
colleges
of
the
empire
in
order
that
they
might
hold
in
the
ensuing
month
of
may
an
extraordinary
assembly
the
this
national
convocation
for
which
napoleon
claimed
a
precedent
in
the
history
of
the
ancient
franks
was
to
have
two
objects
first
to
make
such
alterations
and
reforms
in
the
constitution
of
the
empire
as
circumstances
should
render
advisable
secondly
to
assist
at
the
coronation
of
the
empress
maria
louisa
her
presence
and
that
of
her
son
was
spoken
of
as
something
that
admitted
of
no
doubt
though
bonaparte
knew
there
was
little
hope
of
their
return
from
vienna
these
various
enactments
were
well
calculated
to
serve
napoleon
cause
they
flattered
the
army
and
at
the
same
time
stimulated
their
resentment
against
the
emigrants
by
insinuating
that
they
had
been
sacrificed
by
louis
to
the
interest
of
his
followers
they
held
out
to
the
republicans
a
prospect
of
confiscation
proscription
and
revolution
of
government
while
the
imperialists
were
gratified
with
a
view
of
ample
funds
for
pensions
offices
and
honorary
decorations
to
proprietors
of
the
national
domains
security
was
promised
to
the
parisians
the
grand
spectacle
of
the
and
to
france
peace
and
tranquillity
since
the
arrival
of
the
empress
and
her
son
confidently
asserted
to
be
at
hand
was
taken
as
a
pledge
of
the
friendship
of
austria
napoleon
at
the
same
time
endeavoured
to
make
himself
popular
with
the
common
people
the
mob
of
the
faubourg
antoine
and
other
obscure
quarters
of
paris
on
the
first
evening
of
his
return
as
he
walked
round
the
glittering
circle
met
to
welcome
him
in
the
state
apartments
of
the
tuileries
he
kept
repeating
gentlemen
it
is
to
the
poor
and
disinterested
mass
of
the
people
that
i
owe
everything
it
is
they
who
have
brought
me
back
to
the
capita
it
is
the
poor
subaltern
officers
and
common
soldiers
that
have
done
all
this
i
owe
everything
to
the
common
people
and
the
ranks
of
the
army
remember
that
i
owe
everything
to
the
army
and
the
people
some
time
after
he
took
occasional
rides
through
the
faubourg
antoine
but
the
demonstrations
of
the
mob
gave
him
little
pleasure
and
it
was
easy
to
detect
a
sneer
in
his
addresses
to
them
he
had
some
slight
intercourse
with
the
men
of
the
revolution
the
fierce
bloodthirsty
jacobins
but
even
now
he
could
not
conceal
his
abhorrence
of
them
and
be
it
said
to
his
honour
he
had
as
little
to
do
with
them
as
possible
when
napoleon
departed
for
the
summer
campaign
he
took
care
beforehand
to
leave
large
sums
of
money
for
the
in
the
hands
of
the
devoted
real
under
whose
management
the
mob
was
placed
these
sums
were
to
be
distributed
at
appropriate
seasons
to
make
the
people
cry
in
the
streets
of
paris
napoleon
or
death
he
also
left
in
the
hands
of
davoust
a
written
authority
for
the
publication
of
his
bulletins
many
clauses
of
which
were
written
long
before
the
battles
were
fought
that
they
were
to
describe
he
gave
to
the
same
marshal
a
plan
of
his
campaign
which
he
had
arranged
for
the
defensive
this
was
not
confided
to
him
without
an
injunction
of
the
strictest
secrecy
but
it
is
said
that
davoust
communicated
the
plan
to
fouche
considering
character
this
is
very
unlikely
but
if
so
it
is
far
from
improbable
that
fouche
communicated
the
plan
to
the
allies
with
whom
and
more
particularly
with
prince
metternich
he
is
well
known
to
have
been
corresponding
at
the
time
shortly
after
the
emperor
arrival
in
paris
benjamin
constant
a
moderate
and
candid
man
was
deputed
by
the
constitutional
party
to
ascertain
napoleon
sentiments
and
intentions
constant
was
a
lover
of
constitutional
liberty
and
an
old
opponent
of
napoleon
whose
headlong
career
of
despotism
cut
out
by
the
sword
he
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
check
by
the
eloquence
of
his
pen
the
interview
took
place
at
the
tuileries
the
emperor
as
was
his
wont
began
the
conversation
and
kept
it
nearly
all
to
himself
during
the
rest
of
the
audience
he
did
not
affect
to
disguise
either
his
past
actions
or
present
dispositions
the
nation
he
said
has
had
a
respite
of
twelve
years
from
every
kind
of
political
agitation
and
for
one
year
has
enjoyed
a
respite
from
war
this
double
repose
has
created
a
craving
after
activity
it
requires
or
fancies
it
requires
a
tribune
and
popular
assemblies
it
did
not
always
require
them
the
people
threw
themselves
at
my
feet
when
i
took
the
reins
of
government
you
ought
to
recollect
this
who
made
a
trial
of
opposition
where
was
your
support
your
strength
nowhere
i
assumed
less
authority
than
i
was
invited
to
assume
now
all
is
changed
a
feeble
government
opposed
to
the
national
interests
has
given
to
these
interests
the
habit
of
standing
on
the
defensive
and
evading
authority
the
taste
for
constitutions
for
debates
for
harangues
appears
to
have
revived
nevertheless
it
is
but
the
minority
that
wishes
all
this
be
assured
the
people
or
if
you
like
the
phrase
better
the
multitude
wish
only
for
me
you
would
say
so
if
you
had
only
seen
this
multitude
pressing
eagerly
on
my
steps
rushing
down
from
the
tops
of
the
mountains
calling
on
me
seeking
me
out
saluting
me
on
my
way
from
cannes
hither
i
have
not
conquered
i
have
administered
i
am
not
only
as
has
been
pretended
the
emperor
of
the
soldiers
i
am
that
of
the
peasants
of
the
plebeians
of
france
accordingly
in
spite
of
all
that
has
happened
you
see
the
people
come
back
to
me
there
is
sympathy
between
us
it
is
not
as
with
the
privileged
classes
the
noblesse
have
been
in
my
service
they
thronged
in
crowds
into
my
antechambers
there
is
no
place
that
they
have
not
accepted
or
solicited
i
have
had
the
montmorencys
the
noailles
the
rohans
the
beauveaus
the
montemarts
in
my
train
but
there
never
was
any
cordiality
between
us
the
steed
made
his
curvets
he
was
well
broken
in
but
i
felt
him
quiver
under
me
with
the
people
it
is
another
thing
the
popular
fibre
responds
to
mine
i
have
risen
from
the
ranks
of
the
people
my
voice
seta
mechanically
upon
them
look
at
those
conscripts
the
sons
of
peasants
i
never
flattered
them
i
treated
them
roughly
they
did
not
crowd
round
me
the
less
they
did
not
on
that
account
cease
to
cry
it
is
that
between
them
and
me
there
is
one
and
the
same
nature
they
look
to
me
as
their
support
their
safeguard
against
the
nobles
i
have
but
to
make
a
sign
or
even
to
look
another
way
and
the
nobles
would
be
massacred
in
every
province
so
well
have
they
managed
matters
in
the
last
ten
months
but
i
do
not
desire
to
be
the
king
of
a
mob
if
there
are
the
means
to
govern
by
a
constitution
well
and
good
i
wished
for
the
empire
of
the
world
and
to
ensure
it
complete
liberty
of
action
was
necessary
to
me
to
govern
france
merely
it
is
possible
that
a
constitution
may
be
better
i
wished
for
the
empire
of
the
world
as
who
would
not
have
done
in
my
place
the
world
invited
me
to
rule
over
it
sovereigns
and
subjects
alike
emulously
bowed
the
neck
under
my
sceptre
i
have
seldom
met
with
opposition
in
france
but
still
i
have
encountered
more
of
it
from
some
obscure
and
unarmed
frenchmen
than
from
all
these
kings
so
resolute
just
now
no
longer
to
have
a
man
of
the
people
for
their
equal
see
then
what
appears
to
you
possible
let
me
know
your
ideas
public
discussion
free
elections
responsible
ministers
the
liberty
of
the
press
i
have
no
objection
to
all
that
the
liberty
of
the
press
especially
to
stifle
it
is
absurd
i
am
convinced
on
this
point
i
am
the
man
of
the
people
if
the
people
really
wish
for
liberty
let
them
have
it
i
have
acknowledged
their
sovereignty
it
is
just
that
i
should
lend
an
ear
to
their
will
nay
even
to
their
caprices
i
have
never
been
disposed
to
oppress
them
for
my
pleasure
i
conceived
great
designs
but
fate
been
against
me
i
am
no
longer
a
conqueror
nor
can
i
be
one
i
know
what
is
possible
and
what
is
i
have
no
further
object
than
to
raise
up
france
and
bestow
on
her
a
government
suitable
to
her
i
have
no
hatred
to
liberty
i
have
set
it
aside
when
it
obstructed
my
path
but
i
understand
what
it
means
i
was
brought
up
in
its
school
besides
the
work
of
fifteen
years
is
overturned
and
it
is
not
possible
to
recommence
it
it
would
take
twenty
years
and
the
lives
of
of
men
to
be
sacrificed
to
it
as
for
the
rest
i
desire
peace
but
i
can
only
obtain
it
by
means
of
victory
i
would
not
inspire
you
with
false
expectations
i
permit
it
to
be
said
that
negotiations
are
going
on
there
are
none
i
foresee
a
hard
struggle
a
long
war
to
support
it
i
must
be
seconded
by
the
nation
but
in
return
i
believe
they
will
expect
liberty
they
shall
have
it
the
circumstances
are
new
all
i
desire
is
to
be
informed
of
the
truth
i
am
getting
old
a
man
is
no
longer
at
what
he
was
at
thirty
the
repose
enjoyed
by
a
constitutional
king
may
suit
me
it
will
still
more
certainly
be
the
best
thing
for
my
son
from
this
remarkable
address
benjamin
constant
concluded
that
no
change
had
taken
place
in
bonaparte
views
or
feelings
in
matters
of
government
but
being
convinced
that
circumstances
had
changed
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
conform
to
them
he
says
and
we
can
not
doubt
it
that
he
listened
to
napoleon
with
the
deepest
interest
that
there
was
a
breadth
and
grandeur
of
manner
as
be
spoke
and
a
calm
serenity
seated
on
a
brow
covered
with
immortal
laurels
whilst
believing
the
utter
incompatibility
of
napoleon
and
constitutional
government
we
can
not
in
fairness
omit
mentioning
that
the
causes
which
repelled
him
from
the
altar
and
sanctuary
of
freedom
were
strong
the
real
lovers
of
a
rational
and
feasible
liberty
the
constitutional
monarchy
men
were
few
the
mad
the
jacobins
the
refuse
of
one
revolution
and
the
provokers
of
another
were
numerous
active
loud
and
in
pursuing
different
ends
these
two
parties
the
respectable
and
the
disreputable
the
good
and
the
bad
got
mixed
and
confused
with
one
another
on
the
of
may
when
the
were
marshalled
in
processional
order
and
treated
with
what
was
called
a
solemn
festival
as
they
moved
along
the
boulevards
to
the
court
of
the
tuileries
they
coupled
the
name
of
napoleon
with
jacobin
curses
and
revolutionary
songs
the
airs
and
the
words
that
had
made
paris
tremble
to
her
very
centre
during
the
reign
of
terror
the
marseillaise
the
carmagnole
the
jour
du
depart
the
execrable
ditty
the
burden
of
which
is
and
with
the
entrails
of
the
last
of
the
priests
let
us
strangle
the
last
of
the
kings
were
all
roared
out
in
fearful
chorus
by
a
drunken
filthy
and
furious
mob
many
a
day
had
elapsed
since
they
had
dared
to
sing
these
blasphemous
and
antisocial
songs
in
public
napoleon
himself
as
soon
as
he
had
power
enough
suppressed
them
and
he
was
as
proud
of
this
feat
and
his
triumph
over
the
dregs
of
the
jacobins
as
he
was
of
any
of
his
victories
and
in
this
he
was
right
in
this
he
proved
himself
the
friend
of
humanity
as
the
tumultuous
mass
approached
the
triumphal
arch
and
the
grand
entrance
to
the
palace
he
could
not
conceal
his
abhorrence
his
guards
were
drawn
up
under
arms
and
numerous
pieces
of
artillery
already
loaded
were
turned
out
on
the
place
du
carrousel
he
hastily
dismissed
these
dangerous
partisans
with
some
praise
some
money
and
some
drink
on
coming
into
close
contact
with
such
a
mob
he
did
not
feel
his
fibre
respond
to
that
of
the
populace
like
frankenstein
he
loathed
and
was
afraid
of
the
mighty
monster
he
had
put
together
but
it
was
not
merely
the
mob
that
checked
the
liberalism
or
constitution
of
napoleon
a
delicate
and
doubtful
plant
in
itself
that
required
the
most
cautious
treatment
to
make
it
really
take
root
and
grow
up
in
such
a
soil
some
of
his
councillors
who
called
themselves
philosophical
statesmen
advised
him
to
lay
aside
the
style
of
emperor
and
assume
that
of
high
president
or
lord
general
of
the
republic
annoyed
with
such
puerilities
while
the
enemy
was
every
day
drawing
nearer
the
frontiers
he
withdrew
from
the
tuileries
to
the
comparatively
small
and
retired
palace
of
the
elysee
where
he
escaped
these
and
felt
himself
again
a
sovereign
shut
up
with
benjamin
constant
and
a
few
other
reasonable
politicians
he
drew
up
the
sketch
of
a
new
constitution
which
was
neither
much
better
nor
much
worse
than
the
royal
charter
of
louis
xviii
we
give
an
epitome
of
its
main
features
the
emperor
was
to
have
executive
power
and
to
exercise
legislative
power
in
concurrence
with
the
two
chambers
the
chamber
of
peers
was
to
be
hereditary
and
nominated
by
the
emperor
and
its
number
was
unlimited
the
second
chamber
was
to
be
elected
by
the
people
and
to
consist
of
members
none
to
be
under
the
age
of
the
president
was
to
be
appointed
by
the
members
but
approved
of
by
the
emperor
members
were
to
be
paid
at
the
rate
settled
by
the
constituent
assembly
which
was
to
be
renewed
every
five
years
the
emperor
might
prorogue
adjourn
or
dissolve
the
house
of
representatives
whose
sittings
were
to
be
public
the
electoral
colleges
were
maintained
land
tax
and
direct
taxes
were
to
be
voted
only
for
a
year
indirect
taxes
might
be
imposed
for
several
years
no
levy
of
men
for
the
army
nor
any
exchange
of
territory
was
to
be
made
but
by
a
law
taxes
were
to
be
proposed
by
the
chamber
of
representatives
ministers
to
be
responsible
judges
to
be
irremovable
juries
to
be
established
right
of
petition
freedom
of
worship
inviolability
of
property
were
recognised
liberty
of
the
press
was
given
under
legal
responsibility
and
press
offences
were
to
be
judged
with
a
jury
no
place
or
part
of
the
territory
could
be
placed
in
a
state
of
siege
except
in
case
of
foreign
invasion
or
civil
troubles
finally
the
french
people
declared
that
in
the
delegation
it
thus
made
of
its
powers
it
was
not
to
be
taken
as
giving
the
right
to
propose
the
of
the
bourbons
or
of
any
prince
of
that
family
on
the
throne
even
in
case
of
the
extinction
of
the
imperial
dynasty
any
such
proposal
was
formally
interdicted
to
the
chambers
or
to
the
citizens
as
well
as
any
of
the
following
measures
the
of
the
former
feudal
nobility
of
the
feudal
and
seignorial
rights
of
tithes
of
any
privileged
and
dominant
religion
as
well
as
of
the
power
of
making
any
attack
on
the
irrevocability
of
the
sale
of
the
national
goods
shortly
after
the
return
of
napoleon
from
elba
believing
it
to
be
impossible
to
make
the
emperor
of
austria
consent
to
his
wife
rejoining
him
and
maria
louisa
had
no
inclination
to
a
renewal
of
conjugal
intercourse
napoleon
had
not
been
many
days
in
paris
when
he
concocted
a
plan
for
carrying
off
from
vienna
both
his
wife
and
his
son
in
this
project
force
was
no
less
necessary
than
stratagem
a
number
of
french
of
both
sexes
much
devoted
to
the
emperor
who
had
given
them
rank
and
fortune
had
accompanied
maria
louisa
in
from
paris
to
blois
and
thence
to
vienna
a
correspondence
was
opened
with
these
persons
who
embarked
heart
and
soul
in
the
plot
they
forged
passports
relays
of
horses
and
altogether
arranged
matters
so
well
that
but
a
for
a
single
individual
one
who
revealed
the
whole
project
a
few
days
previously
to
that
fixed
upon
for
carrying
it
into
effect
there
is
little
room
to
doubt
that
the
plan
would
have
succeeded
and
that
the
daughter
of
austria
and
the
titular
king
of
home
would
have
given
such
prestige
as
their
presence
could
give
at
the
tuileries
and
he
mai
no
sooner
had
the
emperor
of
austria
discovered
this
plot
which
had
it
been
successful
would
have
placed
him
in
a
very
awkward
predicament
than
he
dismissed
all
the
french
people
about
his
daughter
compelled
her
to
lay
aside
the
armorial
bearings
and
liveries
of
napoleon
and
even
to
relinquish
the
title
of
empress
of
the
french
no
force
no
art
no
police
could
conceal
these
things
from
the
people
of
paris
who
moreover
and
at
nearly
the
same
time
were
made
very
uneasy
by
the
failure
of
murat
attempt
in
italy
which
greatly
increased
the
power
and
political
influence
of
austria
murat
being
disposed
of
the
emperor
francis
was
enabled
to
concentrate
all
his
forces
in
italy
and
to
hold
them
in
readiness
for
the
of
france
napoleon
says
lavallette
had
undoubtedly
expected
that
the
empress
and
his
son
would
be
restored
to
him
he
had
published
his
wishes
as
a
certainty
and
to
prevent
it
was
in
fact
the
worst
injury
the
emperor
of
austria
could
have
done
him
his
hope
was
however
soon
destroyed
one
evening
i
was
summoned
to
the
palace
i
found
the
emperor
in
a
closet
warming
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
and
appearing
to
suffer
already
from
the
complaint
which
never
afterwards
left
him
is
a
letter
he
said
the
courier
from
vienna
says
is
meant
for
you
read
it
on
first
casting
my
eyes
on
the
letter
i
thought
i
knew
the
handwriting
but
as
it
was
long
i
read
it
slowly
and
came
at
last
to
the
principal
object
the
writer
said
that
we
ought
not
to
reckon
upon
the
empress
as
she
did
not
even
attempt
to
conceal
her
dislike
of
the
emperor
and
was
disposed
to
approve
all
the
measures
that
could
be
taken
against
him
that
her
return
was
not
to
be
thought
of
as
she
herself
would
raise
the
greatest
obstacles
in
the
way
of
it
in
case
it
should
be
proposed
finally
that
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
dissemble
his
indignation
that
the
empress
wholly
enamoured
of
did
not
even
take
pains
to
hide
her
ridiculous
partiality
for
him
the
handwriting
of
the
letter
was
disguised
yet
not
so
much
but
that
i
was
able
to
discover
whose
it
was
i
found
however
in
the
manner
in
which
the
secret
was
expressed
a
warmth
of
zeal
and
a
picturesque
style
that
did
not
belong
to
the
author
of
the
letter
while
reading
it
i
all
of
a
sudden
suspected
it
was
a
counterfeit
and
intended
to
mislead
the
emperor
i
communicated
ms
idea
to
him
and
the
danger
i
perceived
in
this
fraud
as
i
grew
more
and
more
animated
i
found
plausible
reasons
enough
to
throw
the
emperor
himself
into
some
uncertainty
is
it
possible
i
said
should
have
been
imprudent
enough
to
write
such
things
to
me
who
am
not
his
friend
and
who
have
had
so
little
connection
with
him
how
can
one
suppose
that
the
empress
should
forget
herself
in
such
circumstances
so
far
as
to
manifest
aversion
to
you
and
still
more
to
cast
herself
away
upon
a
man
who
undoubtedly
still
possesses
some
power
to
please
but
who
is
no
longer
young
whose
face
is
disfigured
and
whose
person
altogether
has
nothing
agreeable
in
it
answered
the
emperor
is
attached
to
me
and
though
he
is
not
your
friend
the
postscript
sufficiently
explains
the
motive
of
the
confidence
he
places
in
you
the
following
words
were
in
fact
written
at
the
bottom
of
the
letter
do
not
think
you
ought
to
mention
the
truth
to
the
emperor
but
make
whatever
use
of
it
you
think
proper
i
persisted
however
in
maintaining
that
the
letter
was
a
counterfeit
and
the
emperor
then
said
to
me
to
caulaincourt
he
possesses
a
great
many
others
in
the
same
handwriting
let
the
comparison
decide
between
your
opinion
and
mine
i
went
to
caulaincourt
who
said
eagerly
to
me
am
sure
the
letter
is
from
and
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
particulars
it
contains
the
best
thing
the
emperor
can
do
is
to
be
comforted
there
is
no
help
to
be
expected
from
that
side
so
sad
a
discovery
was
very
painful
to
the
emperor
for
he
was
sincerely
attached
to
the
empress
and
still
hoped
again
to
see
his
son
whom
he
loved
most
tenderly
fouche
had
been
far
from
wishing
the
return
of
the
emperor
he
was
long
tired
of
obeying
and
had
besides
undertaken
another
plan
which
napoleon
arrival
had
broken
off
the
emperor
however
put
him
again
at
the
head
of
the
police
because
savary
was
worn
out
in
that
employment
and
a
skillful
man
was
wanted
there
fouche
accepted
the
office
but
without
giving
up
his
plan
of
deposing
the
emperor
to
put
in
his
place
either
his
son
or
a
republic
under
a
president
he
had
never
ceased
to
correspond
with
prince
metternich
and
if
he
is
to
be
believed
he
tried
to
persuade
the
emperor
to
abdicate
in
favour
of
his
son
that
was
also
my
opinion
but
coming
from
such
a
quarter
the
advice
was
not
without
danger
for
the
person
to
whom
it
was
given
besides
that
advice
having
been
rejected
it
was
the
duty
of
the
minister
either
to
think
no
more
of
his
plan
or
to
resign
his
office
fouche
however
remained
in
the
cabinet
and
continued
his
correspondence
the
emperor
who
placed
but
little
confidence
in
him
kept
a
careful
eye
upon
him
one
evening
the
emperor
had
a
great
deal
of
company
at
the
elysee
he
told
me
not
to
go
home
because
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
when
everybody
was
gone
the
emperor
stopped
with
fouche
in
the
apartment
next
to
the
one
i
was
in
the
door
remained
half
open
they
walked
up
and
down
together
talking
very
calmly
i
was
therefore
greatly
astonished
when
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
heard
the
emperor
say
to
him
gravely
are
a
traitor
why
do
you
remain
minister
of
the
police
if
you
wish
to
betray
me
it
rests
with
me
to
have
you
hanged
and
everybody
would
rejoice
at
your
death
i
did
not
hear
fouche
reply
but
the
conversation
lasted
above
half
an
hour
longer
the
parties
all
the
time
walking
up
and
down
when
fouche
went
away
he
bade
me
cheerfully
and
said
that
the
emperor
had
gone
back
to
his
apartments
the
next
day
the
emperor
spoke
to
me
of
the
previous
conversation
suspected
he
said
the
wretch
was
in
correspondence
with
vienna
i
have
had
a
banker
clerk
arrested
on
his
return
from
that
city
he
has
acknowledged
that
he
brought
a
letter
for
fouche
from
metternich
and
that
the
answer
was
to
be
sent
at
a
fixed
time
to
bale
where
a
man
was
to
wait
for
the
bearer
on
the
bridge
i
sent
for
fouche
a
few
days
ago
and
kept
him
three
hours
long
in
my
garden
hoping
that
in
the
course
of
a
friendly
conversation
he
would
mention
that
letter
to
me
but
he
said
nothing
at
last
yesterday
evening
i
myself
opened
the
subject
here
the
emperor
repeated
to
me
the
words
i
had
heard
the
night
before
are
a
traitor
etc
he
acknowledged
in
fact
continued
the
emperor
he
had
received
such
a
letter
but
that
it
was
not
signed
and
that
he
had
looked
upon
it
as
a
mystification
he
showed
it
me
now
that
letter
was
evidently
an
answer
in
which
the
writer
again
declared
that
he
would
listen
to
nothing
more
concerning
the
emperor
but
that
his
person
excepted
it
would
be
easy
to
agree
to
all
the
rest
i
expected
that
the
emperor
would
conclude
his
narrative
by
expressing
his
anger
against
fouche
but
our
conversation
turned
on
some
other
subject
and
he
talked
no
more
of
him
two
days
afterwards
i
went
to
fouche
to
solicit
the
return
to
paris
of
an
officer
of
musqueteers
who
had
been
banished
far
from
his
family
i
found
him
at
breakfast
and
sat
down
next
to
him
facing
him
sat
a
stranger
you
see
this
man
he
said
to
me
pointing
with
his
spoon
to
the
stranger
is
an
aristocrat
a
bourbonist
a
chouan
it
is
the
abbe
one
of
the
editors
of
the
journal
des
debats
a
sworn
enemy
to
napoleon
a
fanatic
partisan
of
the
bourbons
he
is
one
of
our
men
i
looked
at
him
at
every
fresh
epithet
of
the
minister
the
abbe
bowed
his
head
down
to
his
plate
with
a
smile
of
cheerfulness
and
complacency
and
with
a
sort
of
leer
i
never
saw
a
more
ignoble
countenance
fouche
explained
to
me
on
leaving
the
breakfast
table
in
what
manner
all
these
valets
of
literature
were
men
of
his
and
while
i
acknowledged
to
myself
that
the
system
might
be
necessary
i
scarcely
knew
who
were
really
more
despicable
the
wretches
who
thus
sold
themselves
to
the
highest
bidder
or
the
minister
who
boasted
of
having
bought
them
as
if
their
acquisition
were
a
glorious
conquest
judging
that
the
emperor
had
spoken
to
me
of
the
scene
i
have
described
above
fouche
said
to
me
emperor
temper
is
soured
by
the
resistance
he
finds
and
he
thinks
it
is
my
fault
he
does
not
know
that
i
have
no
power
but
by
public
opinion
to
morrow
i
might
hang
before
my
door
twenty
persons
obnoxious
to
public
opinion
though
i
should
not
be
able
to
imprison
for
hours
any
individual
favoured
by
it
as
i
am
never
in
a
hurry
to
speak
i
remained
silent
but
reflecting
on
what
the
emperor
had
said
concerning
fouche
i
found
the
comparison
of
their
two
speeches
remarkable
the
master
could
have
his
minister
hanged
with
public
applause
and
the
minister
could
hang
whom
perhaps
the
master
himself
and
with
the
same
approbation
what
a
singular
situation
and
i
believe
they
were
both
in
the
right
so
far
public
opinion
equitable
in
regard
to
fouche
had
swerved
concerning
the
emperor
the
wrath
of
napoleon
was
confined
to
the
lower
house
the
peers
from
the
nature
of
their
composition
being
complacent
and
passive
enough
the
vast
majority
of
them
were
in
fact
mere
shadows
gathered
round
the
solid
persons
of
joseph
lucien
louis
and
jerome
bonaparte
and
sieyes
carnot
and
the
military
men
of
the
revolution
as
a
political
body
napoleon
despised
them
himself
and
yet
he
wanted
the
nation
to
respect
them
but
respect
was
impossible
and
the
volatile
parisians
made
the
peers
a
constant
object
of
their
witticisms
the
punsters
of
paris
made
the
following
somewhat
ingenious
play
upon
words
lallemand
labedogure
drouot
and
ney
they
called
las
quatre
pairs
fides
perfides
which
in
pronunciation
may
equally
mean
the
four
faithful
peers
or
the
four
perfidious
men
the
infamous
vandamme
and
another
were
called
siffles
the
biased
peers
or
the
biased
pair
or
persiffles
men
made
objects
of
derision
it
was
thus
the
lower
orders
behaved
while
the
existence
of
france
was
at
stake
by
this
time
the
of
war
had
gathered
and
was
ready
to
burst
short
as
the
time
at
his
disposal
was
napoleon
prepared
to
meet
it
with
his
accustomed
energy
firearms
formed
one
of
the
most
important
objects
of
attention
there
were
sufficient
sabres
but
muskets
were
wanting
the
imperial
factories
could
in
ordinary
times
furnish
monthly
stands
of
new
arms
by
the
extraordinary
activity
and
inducements
offered
this
number
was
doubled
workmen
were
also
employed
in
repairing
the
old
muskets
there
was
displayed
at
this
momentous
period
the
same
activity
in
the
capital
as
in
and
better
directed
though
without
the
same
ultimate
success
the
clothing
of
the
army
was
another
difficulty
and
this
was
got
over
by
advancing
large
sums
of
money
to
the
cloth
manufacturers
beforehand
the
contractors
delivered
cavalry
horses
before
the
of
june
trained
horses
had
been
furnished
by
the
dismounted
gendarmerie
twelve
thousand
artillery
horses
were
also
delivered
by
the
of
june
in
addition
to
which
the
army
already
had
the
facility
with
which
the
ministers
of
finance
and
of
the
treasury
provided
for
all
these
expenses
astonished
everybody
as
it
was
necessary
to
pay
for
everything
in
ready
money
the
system
of
public
works
was
at
the
same
time
resumed
throughout
france
it
is
easy
to
see
said
the
workmen
that
great
contractor
is
returned
all
was
dead
now
everything
revives
we
have
just
learnt
says
a
writer
who
was
at
brussels
at
this
time
that
napoleon
had
left
the
capital
of
france
on
the
on
the
the
frequent
arrival
of
couriers
excited
extreme
anxiety
and
towards
evening
general
muffing
presented
himself
at
the
hotel
of
the
duke
of
wellington
with
despatches
from
blucher
we
were
all
aware
that
the
enemy
was
in
movement
and
the
ignorant
could
not
solve
the
enigma
of
the
duke
going
tranquilly
to
the
ball
at
the
duke
of
richmond
his
coolness
was
above
their
comprehension
had
he
remained
at
his
own
hotel
a
panic
would
have
probably
ensued
amongst
the
inhabitants
which
would
have
embarrassed
the
intended
movement
of
the
british
division
of
the
army
i
returned
home
late
and
we
were
still
talking
over
our
uneasiness
when
we
heard
the
trumpets
sound
before
the
sun
had
risen
in
full
splendour
i
heard
martial
music
approaching
and
soon
beheld
from
my
windows
the
reserve
of
the
british
army
passing
the
highland
brigade
were
the
first
in
advance
led
by
their
noble
thanes
the
bagpipes
playing
their
several
pibrochs
they
were
succeeded
by
the
their
bugles
note
falling
more
blithely
upon
the
ear
each
regiment
passed
in
succession
with
its
band
playing
the
gallant
duke
of
brunswick
was
at
a
ball
at
the
in
the
rue
ducale
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
when
the
french
guns
which
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
hear
were
clearly
distinguished
at
brussels
upon
receiving
the
information
that
a
powerful
french
force
was
advancing
in
the
direction
of
charleroi
it
is
high
time
for
me
to
be
off
he
exclaimed
and
immediately
quitted
the
at
four
the
whole
disposable
force
under
the
duke
off
wellington
was
collected
together
but
in
such
haste
that
many
of
the
officers
had
no
time
to
change
their
silk
stockings
and
and
some
quite
overcome
by
drowsiness
were
seen
lying
asleep
about
the
ramparts
still
holding
however
with
a
firm
hand
the
reins
of
their
horses
which
were
grazing
by
their
sides
about
five
the
word
march
was
heard
in
ail
directions
and
instantly
the
whole
mass
appeared
to
move
simultaneously
i
conversed
with
several
of
the
officers
previous
to
their
departure
and
not
one
appeared
to
have
the
slightest
idea
of
an
approaching
engagement
the
duke
of
wellington
and
his
staff
did
not
quit
brussels
till
past
eleven
and
it
was
not
till
some
time
after
they
were
gone
that
it
was
generally
known
the
whole
french
army
including
a
strong
corps
of
cavalry
was
within
a
few
miles
of

appeared
in

and
is
not
from
the
pen
of
de
bourrienne
the
battles
of
ligny
and
quatre
bras
the
moment
for
striking
a
decisive
blow
had
now
come
and
accordingly
early
on
the
morning
of
the
the
whole
of
the
french
army
was
in
motion
the
corps
proceeded
to
marchiennes
to
attack
the
prussian
outposts
at
thuin
and
lobes
in
order
to
secure
the
communication
across
the
sambre
between
those
places
the
corps
covered
by
general
pajol
cavalry
advanced
upon
charleroi
followed
by
the
imperial
guard
and
the
corps
with
the
necessary
detachments
of
pontoniers
the
remainder
of
the
cavalry
under
grouchy
also
advanced
upon
charleroi
on
the
flanks
of
the
and
corps
the
corps
was
ordered
to
march
upon
the
bridge
of
chatelet
on
the
approach
of
the
french
advanced
guards
an
incessant
skirmish
was
maintained
during
the
whole
morning
with
the
prussians
who
after
losing
many
men
were
compelled
to
yield
to
superior
numbers
general
zieten
finding
it
impossible
from
the
extent
of
frontier
he
had
to
cover
to
cheek
the
advance
of
the
french
fell
back
towards
fleurus
by
the
road
to
charleroi
resolutely
contesting
the
advance
of
the
enemy
wherever
it
was
possible
in
the
repeated
attacks
sustained
by
him
he
suffered
considerable
loss
it
was
nearly
before
a
passage
through
charleroi
was
secured
by
the
french
army
and
general
zieten
continued
his
retreat
upon
fleurus
where
he
took
up
his
position
for
the
night
upon
zieten
abandoning
in
the
course
of
his
retreat
the
chaussee
which
leads
to
brussels
through
quatre
bras
marshal
ney
who
had
only
just
been
put
in
command
on
the
left
of
the
french
army
was
ordered
to
advance
by
this
road
upon
gosselies
and
found
at
frasnes
part
of
the
duke
of
wellington
army
composed
of
nassau
troops
under
the
command
of
prince
bernard
of
who
after
some
skirmishing
maintained
his
position
notwithstanding
all
the
exertions
of
the
french
at
a
moment
when
time
was
of
such
importance
they
had
only
been
able
to
advance
about
fifteen
english
miles
during
the
day
with
nearly
fifteen
hours
of
daylight
it
was
the
intention
of
napoleon
during
his
operations
on
this
day
to
effect
a
separation
between
the
english
and
prussian
armies
in
which
he
had
nearly
succeeded
napoleon
plan
for
this
purpose
and
the
execution
of
it
by
his
army
were
alike
admirable
but
it
is
hardly
probable
that
the
allied
generals
were
taken
by
surprise
as
it
was
the
only
likely
course
which
napoleon
could
have
taken
his
line
of
operation
was
on
the
direct
road
to
brussels
and
there
were
no
fortified
works
to
impede
his
progress
while
from
the
nature
of
the
country
his
numerous
and
excellent
cavalry
could
be
employed
with
great
effect
in
the
french
accounts
marshal
ney
was
much
blamed
for
not
occupying
quatre
bras
with
the
whole
of
his
force
on
the
evening
of
the
ney
might
probably
have
driven
back
the
nassau
troops
at
quatre
bras
and
occupied
that
important
position
but
hearing
a
heavy
cannonade
on
his
right
flank
where
general
zieten
had
taken
up
his
position
he
thought
it
necessary
to
halt
and
detach
a
division
in
the
direction
of
fleurus
he
was
severely
censured
by
napoleon
for
not
having
literally
followed
his
orders
and
pushed
on
to
quatre
bras
this
accusation
forms
a
curious
contrast
with
that
made
against
grouchy
upon
whom
napoleon
threw
the
blame
of
the
defeat
at
waterloo
because
he
strictly
fulfilled
his
orders
by
pressing
the
prussians
at
wavre
unheeding
the
cannonade
on
his
left
which
might
have
led
him
to
conjecture
that
the
more
important
contest
between
the
emperor
and
wellington
was
at
that
moment
raging
it
was
at
six
in
the
evening
of
the
that
the
drake
of
wellington
received
the
first
information
of
the
advance
of
the
french
army
but
it
was
not
however
until
ten
that
positive
news
reached
him
that
the
french
army
had
moved
upon
the
line
of
the
sambre
this
information
induced
him
to
push
forward
reinforcements
on
quatre
bras
at
which
place
he
himself
arrived
at
an
early
hour
on
the
and
immediately
proceeded
to
bry
to
devise
measures
with
marshal
blucher
in
order
to
combine
their
efforts
from
the
movement
of
considerable
masses
of
the
french
in
front
of
the
prussians
it
was
evident
that
their
first
grand
attack
would
be
directed
against
them
that
this
was
object
on
the
maybe
seen
by
his
orders
to
ney
and
grouchy
to
turn
the
right
of
the
prussians
and
drive
the
british
from
their
position
at
quatre
bras
and
then
to
march
down
the
chaussee
upon
bry
in
order
effectually
to
separate
the
two
armies
ney
was
accordingly
detached
for
this
purpose
with
men
in
the
event
of
the
success
of
marshal
ney
he
would
have
been
enabled
to
detach
a
portion
of
his
forces
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
flank
attack
upon
the
prussians
in
the
rear
of

chapter
ix
the
battle
of
waterloo
one
of
the
most
important
struggles
of
modern
times
was
now
about
to
commence
a
struggle
which
for
many
years
was
to
decide
the
fate
of
europe
napoleon
and
wellington
at
length
stood
opposite
one
another
they
had
never
met
the
military
reputation
of
each
was
of
the
highest
kind
for
full
details
of
the
waterloo
campaign
see
siborne
history
of
the
war
in
france
and
belgium
in
giving
the
english
contemporary
account
chesney
waterloo
lectures
the
best
english
modern
account
which
has
been
accepted
by
the
prussians
as
pretty
nearly
representing
their
view
and
waterloo
by
prince
edouard
de
la
tour
paris
plon
which
may
be
taken
as
the
french
modern
account
in
judging
this
campaign
the
reader
must
guard
himself
from
looking
on
it
as
fought
by
two
different
english
and
the
achievements
are
to
be
weighed
against
one
another
wellington
and
blucher
were
acting
in
a
complete
unison
rare
even
when
two
different
corps
of
the
same
nation
are
concerned
but
practically
unexampled
in
the
case
of
two
armies
of
different
nations
thus
the
two
forces
became
one
army
divided
into
two
wings
one
the
left
or
prussian
wing
having
been
defeated
by
the
main
body
of
the
french
at
ligny
on
the
of
june
the
right
or
english
wing
retreated
to
hold
the
position
at
waterloo
where
the
left
or
prussian
wing
was
to
join
it
and
the
united
force
was
to
crash
the
enemy
thus
there
is
no
question
as
to
whether
the
prussian
army
saved
the
english
by
their
arrival
or
whether
the
english
saved
the
prussians
by
their
resistance
at
waterloo
each
army
executed
well
and
gallantly
its
part
in
a
concerted
operation
the
english
would
never
have
fought
at
waterloo
if
they
had
not
relied
on
the
arrival
of
the
prussians
had
the
prussians
not
come
up
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
june
the
english
would
have
been
exposed
to
the
same
great
peril
of
having
alone
to
deal
with
the
mass
of
the
french
army
as
the
prussians
would
have
had
to
face
if
they
had
found
the
english
in
full
retreat
to
investigate
the
relative
performances
of
the
two
armies
is
lunch
the
same
as
to
decide
the
respective
merits
of
the
two
prussian
armies
at
sadowa
where
one
held
the
austrians
until
the
other
arrived
also
in
reading
the
many
interesting
personal
accounts
of
the
campaign
it
most
be
remembered
that
opinions
about
the
chance
of
success
in
a
defensive
struggle
are
apt
to
warp
with
the
observer
position
as
indeed
general
grant
has
remarked
in
answer
to
criticisms
on
his
army
state
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
of
the
battle
of
shiloh
or
landing
the
man
placed
in
the
front
rank
or
fighting
line
sees
attack
after
attack
beaten
off
he
sees
only
part
of
his
own
losses
am
most
of
the
wounded
disappear
and
he
also
knows
something
of
the
enemy
loss
by
seeing
the
dead
in
front
of
him
warmed
by
the
contest
he
thus
believes
in
success
the
man
placed
in
rear
or
advancing
with
reinforcements
having
nothing
of
the
excitement
of
the
struggle
sees
only
the
long
and
increasing
column
of
wounded
stragglers
and
perhaps
of
fliers
he
sees
his
companion
fall
without
being
able
to
answer
the
fire
he
sees
nothing
of
the
corresponding
loss
of
the
enemy
and
he
is
apt
to
take
a
most
desponding
view
of
the
situation
thus
englishmen
reading
the
accounts
of
men
who
fought
at
waterloo
are
too
ready
to
disbelieve
representations
of
what
was
taking
place
in
the
rear
of
the
army
and
to
think
thackeray
picture
in
vanity
fair
of
the
state
of
brussels
must
be
overdrawn
indeed
in
this
very
battle
of
waterloo
zieten
began
to
retreat
when
his
help
was
most
required
because
one
of
his
aides
de
camp
told
him
that
the
right
wing
of
the
english
was
in
full
retreat
this
inexperienced
young
man
says
muffling
had
mistaken
the
great
number
of
wounded
going
or
being
taken
to
the
rear
to
be
dressed
for
fugitives
and
accordingly
made
a
false
report
further
reserves
do
not
say
much
of
their
part
or
sometimes
no
part
of
the
fight
and
few
people
know
that
at
least
two
english
regiments
actually
present
on
the
field
of
waterloo
hardly
fired
a
shot
till
the
last
advance
the
duke
described
the
army
as
the
worst
he
ever
commanded
and
said
that
if
he
had
had
his
peninsular
men
the
fight
would
have
been
over
much
sooner
but
the
duke
sticking
to
ideas
now
obsolete
had
no
picked
corps
each
man
trusting
in
and
trusted
by
his
comrades
fought
under
his
own
officers
and
under
his
own
regimental
colours
whatever
they
did
not
know
the
men
knew
how
to
die
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
heap
of
dead
told
where
each
regiment
and
battery
had
stood
the
career
of
both
had
been
marked
by
signal
victory
napoleon
had
carried
his
triumphant
legions
across
the
stupendous
alps
over
the
north
of
italy
throughout
prussia
austria
russia
and
even
to
the
foot
of
the
pyramids
while
wellington
who
had
been
early
distinguished
in
india
had
won
immortal
renown
in
the
peninsula
where
he
had
defeated
one
after
another
the
favourite
generals
of
napoleon
he
was
now
to
make
trial
of
his
prowess
against
their
master
among
the
most
critical
events
of
modern
times
the
battle
of
waterloo
stands
conspicuous
this
sanguinary
encounter
at
last
stopped
the
torrent
of
the
ruthless
and
predatory
ambition
of
the
french
by
which
so
many
countries
had
been
desolated
with
the
peace
which
immediately
succeeded
it

was

misfortune
what
will
become
of
poor
france
i
have
done
all
i
could
for
her
he
then
heaved
a
deep
sigh
somebody
asked
to
speak
to
him
and
i
left
him
with
a
direction
to
come
back
at
a
later
hour
i
passed
the
day
in
seeking
information
among
all
my
friends
and
acquaintances
i
found
in
all
of
them
either
the
greatest
dejection
or
an
extravagant
joy
which
they
disguised
by
feigned
alarm
and
pity
for
myself
which
i
repulsed
with
great
indignation
nothing
favourable
was
to
be
expected
from
the
chamber
of
representatives
they
all
said
they
wished
for
liberty
but
between
two
enemies
who
appeared
ready
to
destroy
it
they
preferred
the
foreigners
the
friends
of
the
bourbons
to
napoleon
who
might
still
have
prolonged
the
struggle
but
that
he
alone
would
not
find
means
to
save
them
and
erect
the
edifice
of
liberty
the
chamber
of
peers
presented
a
much
sadder
spectacle
except
the
intrepid
thibaudeau
who
till
the
last
moment
expressed
himself
with
admirable
energy
against
the
bourbons
almost
all
the
others
thought
of
nothing
else
but
getting
out
of
the
dilemma
with
the
least
loss
they
could
some
took
no
pains
to
hide
their
wish
of
bending
again
under
the
bourbon
yoke
on
the
evening
of
napoleon
return
to
paris
he
sent
for
benjamin
constant
to
come
to
him
at
the
elysee
about
seven
the
chambers
had
decreed
their
permanence
and
proposals
for
abdication
had
reached
the
emperor
he
was
serious
but
calm
in
reply
to
some
words
on
the
disaster
of
waterloo
he
said
the
question
no
longer
concerns
me
but
france
they
wish
me
to
abdicate
have
they
calculated
upon
the
inevitable
consequences
of
this
abdication
it
is
round
me
round
my
name
that
the
army
rallies
to
separate
me
from
it
is
to
disband
it
if
i
abdicate
in
two
days
time
you
will
no
longer
have
an
army
these
poor
fellows
do
not
understand
all
your
subtleties
is
it
believed
that
axioms
in
metaphysics
declarations
of
right
harangues
from
the
tribune
will
put
a
stop
to
the
disbanding
of
an
army
to
reject
me
when
i
landed
at
cannes
i
can
conceive
possible
to
abandon
me
now
is
what
i
do
not
understand
it
is
not
when
the
enemy
is
at
distance
that
any
government
can
be
overturned
with
impunity
does
any
one
imagine
that
the
foreign
powers
will
be
won
over
by
fine
words
if
they
had
dethroned
me
fifteen
days
ago
there
would
have
been
some
spirit
in
it
but
as
it
is
i
make
part
of
what
strangers
attack
i
make
part
then
of
what
france
is
bound
to
defend
in
giving
me
up
she
gives
up
herself
she
avows
her
weakness
she
acknowledges
herself
conquered
she
courts
the
insolence
of
the
conqueror
it
is
not
the
love
of
liberty
which
deposes
me
but
waterloo
it
is
fear
and
a
fear
of
which
your
enemies
will
take
advantage
and
then
what
title
has
the
chamber
to
demand
my
abdication
it
goes
out
of
its
lawful
sphere
in
doing
so
it
has
no
authority
it
is
my
right
it
is
my
duty
to
dissolve
it
he
then
hastily
ran
over
the
possible
consequences
of
such
a
step
separated
from
the
chambers
he
could
only
be
considered
as
a
military
chief
but
the
army
would
be
for
him
that
would
always
join
him
who
can
lead
it
against
foreign
banners
and
to
this
might
be
added
all
that
part
of
the
population
which
is
equally
powerful
and
easily
led
in
such
a
state
of
things
as
if
chance
intended
to
strengthen
napoleon
in
this
train
of
thought
while
he
was
speaking
the
avenue
of
marigny
resounded
with
the
cries
of
a
crowd
of
men
chiefly
of
the
poor
and
labouring
class
pressed
forward
into
the
avenue
full
of
wild
enthusiasm
and
trying
to
scale
the
walls
to
make
an
offer
to
napoleon
to
rally
round
and
defend
him
bonaparte
for
some
time
looked
attentively
at
this
group
see
it
is
so
said
he
those
are
not
the
men
whom
i
have
loaded
with
honours
and
riches
what
do
these
people
owe
me
i
found
them
i
left
them
poor
the
instinct
of
necessity
enlightens
them
the
voice
of
the
country
speaks
by
their
months
and
if
i
choose
if
i
permit
it
in
an
hour
the
refractory
chambers
will
have
ceased
to
exist
but
the
life
of
a
man
is
not
worth
purchasing
at
such
a
price
i
did
not
return
from
the
isle
of
elba
that
paris
should
be
inundated
with
blood
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
flight
should
i
not
stay
here
he
repeated
do
you
suppose
they
would
do
to
a
man
disarmed
like
me
i
will
go
to
malmaison
i
can
live
there
in
retirement
with
some
friends
who
most
certainly
will
come
to
see
me
only
for
my
own
sake
he
then
described
with
complacency
and
even
with
a
sort
of
gaiety
this
new
kind
of
life
afterwards
discarding
an
idea
which
sounded
like
mere
irony
he
went
on
they
do
not
like
me
to
remain
in
france
where
am
i
to
go
to
england
my
abode
there
would
be
ridiculous
or
disquieting
i
should
be
tranquil
no
one
would
believe
it
every
fog
would
be
suspected
of
concealing
my
landing
on
the
coast
at
the
first
sign
of
a
green
coat
getting
out
of
a
boat
one
party
would
fly
from
france
the
other
would
put
france
out
of
the
pale
of
the
law
i
should
compromise
everybody
and
by
dint
of
the
repeated
behold
he
comes
i
should
feel
the
temptation
to
set
out
america
would
be
more
suitable
i
could
live
there
with
dignity
but
once
more
what
is
there
to
fear
what
sovereign
can
without
injuring
himself
persecute
me
to
one
i
have
restored
half
his
dominions
how
often
has
the
other
pressed
my
hand
calling
me
a
great
man
and
as
to
the
third
can
he
find
pleasure
or
honour
in
humiliation
of
his
would
they
wish
to
proclaim
in
the
face
of
the
world
that
all
they
did
was
through
fear
as
to
the
rest
i
shall
see
i
do
not
wish
to
employ
open
force
i
came
in
the
hope
of
combining
our
last
resources
they
abandoned
me
they
do
so
with
the
same
facility
with
which
they
received
me
back
well
then
let
them
efface
if
possible
this
double
stain
of
weakness
and
levity
let
them
cover
it
over
with
some
sacrifice
with
some
glory
let
them
do
for
the
country
what
they
will
not
do
for
me
i
doubt
it
those
who
deliver
up
bonaparte
say
that
it
is
to
save
france
by
delivering
up
france
they
will
prove
that
it
was
to
save
their
own
heads
the
humiliating
scenes
which
rapidly
succeeded
one
another
and
which
ended
in
napoleon
unconditional
surrender
may
be
briefly
told
as
soon
as
possible
after
his
arrival
at
paris
he
assembled
his
counsellors
when
he
declared
himself
in
favour
of
still
resisting
the
question
however
was
whether
the
chambers
would
support
him
and
lafayette
being
treacherously
informed
it
is
said
by
fouche
that
it
was
intended
to
dissolve
the
chambers
used
his
influence
to
get
the
chambers
to
adopt
the
propositions
he
laid
before
them
by
these
the
independence
of
the
nation
was
asserted
to
be
in
danger
the
sittings
of
the
chamber
were
declared
permanent
and
all
attempts
to
dissolve
it
were
pronounced
treasonable
the
propositions
were
adopted
and
being
communicated
to
the
chamber
of
peers
that
body
also
declared
itself
permanent
whatever
might
have
been
the
intentions
of
bonaparte
it
was
now
manifest
that
there
were
no
longer
any
hopes
of
his
being
able
to
make
his
will
the
law
of
the
nation
after
some
vacillation
therefore
on
june
he
published
the
following
declaration
to
the
french
people
frenchmen
in
commencing
war
for
maintaining
the
national
independence
i
relied
on
the
union
of
all
efforts
of
all
wills
and
the
concurrence
of
all
the
national
authorities
i
had
reason
to
hope
for
success
and
i
braved
all
the
declarations
of
the
powers
against
me
circumstances
appear
to
me
changed
i
offer
myself
a
sacrifice
to
the
hatred
of
the
enemies
of
france
may
they
prove
sincere
in
their
declarations
and
really
have
directed
them
only
against
my
power
my
political
life
is
terminated
and
i
proclaim
my
son
under
the
title
of
napoleon
emperor
of
the
french
the
present
ministers
will
provisionally
form
the
council
of
the
government
the
interest
which
i
take
in
my
son
induces
me
to
invite
the
chambers
to
form
without
delay
the
regency
by
a
law
unite
all
for
the
public
safety
that
you
may
continue
an
independent
nation
signed
napoleon
this
declaration
was
conveyed
to
both
the
chambers
which
voted
deputations
to
the
late
emperor
accepting
this
abdication
but
in
their
debates
the
nomination
of
his
son
to
the
succession
was
artfully
eluded
the
chamber
of
representatives
voted
the
nomination
of
a
commission
of
five
persons
three
to
be
chosen
from
that
chamber
and
two
from
the
chamber
of
peers
for
the
purpose
of
provisionally
exercising
the
functions
of
government
and
also
that
the
ministers
should
continue
their
respective
functions
under
the
authority
of
this
commission
the
persons
chosen
by
the
chamber
of
representatives
were
carnot
fouche
and
grenier
those
nominated
by
the
peers
were
the
duke
of
vicenza
caulaincourt
and
baron
quinette
the
commission
nominated
five
persons
to
the
allied
army
for
the
purpose
of
proposing
peace
these
proceedings
were
however
rendered
of
little
importance
by
the
resolution
of
the
victors
to
advance
to
paris
napoleon
behaviour
just
before
and
immediately
after
the
crisis
is
well
described
by
lavallette
the
next
day
he
observes
i
returned
to
the
emperor
he
had
received
the
most
positive
accounts
of
the
state
of
feeling
in
the
chamber
of
representatives
the
reports
had
however
been
given
to
him
with
some
little
reserve
for
he
did
not
seem
to
me
convinced
that
the
resolution
was
really
formed
to
pronounce
his
abdication
i
was
better
informed
on
the
matter
and
i
came
to
him
without
having
the
least
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
only
thing
he
could
do
was
to
descend
once
more
from
the
throne
i
communicated
to
him
all
the
particulars
i
had
just
received
and
i
did
not
hesitate
to
advise
him
to
follow
the
only
course
worthy
of
him
he
listened
to
me
with
a
sombre
air
and
though
he
was
in
some
measure
master
of
himself
the
agitation
of
his
mind
and
the
sense
of
his
position
betrayed
themselves
in
his
face
and
in
all
his
motions
know
said
i
your
majesty
may
still
keep
the
sword
drawn
but
with
whom
and
against
whom
defeat
has
chilled
the
courage
of
every
one
the
army
is
still
in
the
greatest
confusion
nothing
is
to
be
expected
from
paris
and
the
coup
of
the
brumaire
can
not
be
renewed
thought
he
replied
stopping
far
from
my
mind
i
will
hear
nothing
more
about
myself
but
poor
france
at
that
moment
savary
and
caulaincourt
entered
and
having
drawn
a
faithful
picture
of
the
exasperation
of
the
deputies
they
persuaded
him
to
assent
to
abdication
some
words
he
uttered
proved
to
us
that
he
would
have
considered
death
preferable
to
that
step
but
still
he
took
it
the
great
act
of
abdication
being
performed
he
remained
calm
during
the
whole
day
giving
his
advice
on
the
position
the
army
should
take
and
on
the
manner
in
which
the
negotiations
with
the
enemy
ought
to
be
conducted
he
insisted
especially
on
the
necessity
of
proclaiming
his
son
emperor
not
so
much
for
the
advantage
of
the
child
as
with
a
view
to
concentrate
all
the
power
of
sentiments
and
affections
unfortunately
nobody
would
listen
to
him
some
men
of
sense
and
courage
rallied
found
that
proposition
in
the
two
chambers
but
fear
swayed
the
majority
and
among
those
who
remained
free
from
it
many
thought
that
a
public
declaration
of
liberty
and
the
resolution
to
defend
it
at
any
price
would
make
the
enemy
and
the
bourbons
turn
back
strange
delusion
of
weakness
and
want
of
experience
it
must
however
be
respected
for
it
had
its
source
in
love
of
their
country
but
while
we
excuse
it
can
it
be
justified
the
population
of
the
metropolis
had
resumed
its
usual
appearance
which
was
that
of
complete
indifference
with
a
resolution
to
cry
live
the
king
provided
the
king
arrived
well
escorted
for
one
must
not
judge
of
the
whole
capital
by
about
part
of
the
inhabitants
who
called
for
arms
and
declared
themselves
warmly
against
the
return
of
the
exiled
family
on
the
i
returned
to
the
elysee
the
emperor
had
been
for
two
hours
in
his
bath
he
himself
turned
the
discourse
on
the
retreat
he
ought
to
choose
and
spoke
of
the
united
states
i
rejected
the
idea
without
reflection
and
with
a
degree
of
vehemence
that
surprised
him
not
america
he
asked
i
answered
moreau
retired
there
the
observation
was
harsh
and
i
should
never
have
forgiven
myself
for
having
expressed
it
if
i
had
not
retracted
my
advice
a
few
days
afterwards
he
heard
it
without
any
apparent
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
must
have
made
an
unfavourable
impression
on
his
mind
i
strongly
urged
on
his
choosing
england
for
his
asylum
the
emperor
went
to
malmaison
he
was
accompanied
thither
by
the
duchesse
de
leu
bertrand
and
his
family
and
the
duc
de
bassano
the
day
that
he
arrived
there
he
proposed
to
me
to
accompany
him
abroad
drouot
he
said
in
france
i
see
the
minister
of
war
wishes
him
not
to
be
lost
to
his
country
i
dare
not
complain
but
it
is
a
great
loss
for
me
i
never
met
with
a
better
head
or
a
more
upright
heart
that
man
was
formed
to
be
a
prime
minister
anywhere
i
declined
to
accompany
him
at
the
time
saying
wife
is
enceinte
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
leave
her
allow
me
some
time
and
i
will
join
you
wherever
you
may
be
i
have
remained
faithful
to
your
majesty
in
better
times
and
you
may
reckon
upon
me
now
nevertheless
if
my
wife
did
not
require
all
my
attention
i
should
do
better
to
go
with
you
for
i
have
sad
forebodings
respecting
my
fate
the
emperor
made
no
answer
but
i
saw
by
the
expression
of
his
countenance
that
he
had
no
better
augury
of
my
fate
than
i
had
however
the
enemy
was
approaching
and
for
the
last
three
days
he
had
solicited
the
provisional
government
to
place
a
frigate
at
his
disposal
with
which
he
might
proceed
to
america
it
had
been
promised
him
he
was
even
pressed
to
set
off
but
he
wanted
to
be
the
bearer
of
the
order
to
the
captain
to
convey
him
to
the
united
states
and
that
order
did
not
arrive
we
all
felt
that
the
delay
of
a
single
hour
might
put
his
freedom
in
jeopardy
after
we
had
talked
the
subject
over
among
ourselves
i
went
to
him
and
strongly
pointed
out
to
him
how
dangerous
it
might
be
to
prolong
his
stay
he
observed
that
he
could
not
go
without
the
order
nevertheless
i
replied
your
presence
on
board
the
ship
will
still
have
a
great
influence
over
frenchmen
cut
the
cables
promise
money
to
the
crew
and
if
the
captain
resist
have
him
put
on
shore
and
hoist
your
sails
i
have
no
doubt
but
fouche
has
sold
you
to
the
allies
believe
it
also
but
go
and
make
the
last
effort
with
the
minister
of
marine
i
went
off
immediately
to
decres
he
was
in
bed
and
listened
to
me
with
an
indifference
that
made
my
blood
boil
he
said
to
me
am
only
a
minister
go
to
fouche
speak
to
the
government
as
for
me
i
can
do
nothing
and
so
saying
he
covered
himself
up
again
in
his
blankets
i
left
him
but
i
could
not
succeed
in
speaking
either
to
fouche
or
to
any
of
the
others
it
was
two
in
the
morning
when
i
returned
to
malmaison
the
emperor
was
in
bed
i
was
admitted
to
his
chamber
where
i
gave
him
an
account
of
the
result
of
my
mission
and
renewed
my
entreaties
he
listened
to
me
but
made
no
answer
he
got
up
however
and
spent
a
part
of
the
night
in
walking
up
and
down
the
room
the
following
day
was
the
last
of
that
sad
drama
the
emperor
had
gone
to
bed
again
and
slept
a
few
hours
i
entered
his
cabinet
at
about
twelve
i
had
known
you
were
here
he
said
would
have
had
you
called
in
he
then
gave
me
on
a
subject
that
interested
him
personally
some
instructions
which
it
is
needless
for
me
to
repeat
soon
after
i
left
him
full
of
anxiety
respecting
his
fate
my
heart
oppressed
with
grief
but
still
far
from
suspecting
the
extent
to
which
both
the
rigour
of
fortune
and
the
cruelty
of
his
enemies
would
be
carried
all
the
morning
of
the
of
june
the
great
road
from
germain
rung
with
the
cries
of
vive
proceeding
from
the
troops
who
passed
under
the
walls
of
malmaison
about
general
becker
sent
by
the
provisional
government
arrived
he
had
been
appointed
to
attend
napoleon
fouche
knew
that
general
becker
had
grievances
against
the
emperor
and
thought
to
find
in
him
willing
agent
he
was
greatly
deceived
for
the
general
paid
to
the
emperor
a
degree
of
respect
highly
to
his
honour
time
now
became
pressing
the
emperor
at
the
moment
of
departure
sent
a
message
by
general
becker
himself
to
the
provisional
government
offering
to
march
as
a
private
citizen
at
the
head
of
the
troops
he
promised
to
repulse
blucher
and
afterwards
to
continue
his
route
upon
the
refusal
of
the
provisional
government
he
quitted
malmaison
on
the
napoleon
and
part
of
his
suite
took
the
road
to
rochefort
he
slept
at
rambouillet
on
the
of
june
on
the
at
tours
on
the
of
july
he
arrived
at
niort
and
on
the
reached
rochefort
on
the
western
coast
of
france
with
the
intention
of
escaping
to
america
but
the
whole
western
seaboard
was
so
vigilantly
watched
by
british
that
after
various
plans
and
devices
he
was
obliged
to
abandon
the
attempt
in
despair
he
was
lodged
at
the
house
of
the
prefect
at
the
balcony
of
which
he
occasionally
showed
himself
to
acknowledge
the
acclamations
of
the
people
during
his
stay
here
a
french
naval
officer
commanding
a
danish
merchant
vessel
generously
offered
to
some
of
napoleon
adherents
to
further
his
escape
he
proposed
to
take
napoleon
alone
and
undertook
to
conceal
his
person
so
effectually
as
to
defy
the
most
rigid
scrutiny
and
offered
to
sail
immediately
to
the
united
states
of
america
he
required
no
other
compensation
than
a
small
sum
to
indemnify
the
owners
of
his
ship
for
the
loss
this
enterprise
might
occasion
them
this
was
agreed
to
by
bertrand
upon
certain
stipulations
on
the
evening
of
the
of
july
napoleon
reached
fouras
receiving
everywhere
testimonies
of
attachment
he
proceeded
on
board
the
saale
one
of
the
two
frigates
appointed
by
the
provisional
government
to
convey
him
to
the
united
states
and
slept
on
board
that
night
very
early
on
the
following
morning
he
visited
the
fortifications
of
that
place
and
returned
to
the
frigate
for
dinner
on
the
evening
of
the
of
july
he
despatched
count
las
cases
and
the
duke
of
rovigo
to
the
commander
of
the
english
squadron
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
the
passports
promised
by
the
provisional
government
to
enable
him
to
proceed
to
america
had
been
received
a
negative
answer
was
returned
it
was
at
the
same
time
signified
that
the
emperor
would
be
attacked
by
the
english
squadron
if
he
attempted
to
sail
under
a
flag
of
truce
and
it
was
intimated
that
every
neutral
vessel
would
be
examined
and
probably
sent
into
an
english
port
las
cases
affirms
that
napoleon
was
recommended
to
proceed
to
england
by
captain
maitland
who
assured
him
that
he
would
experience
no
there
the
english
ship
then
anchored
in
the
basque
roads
within
sight
of
the
french
vessels
of
war
the
coast
being
as
we
have
stated
entirely
blockaded
by
the
english
squadron
the
emperor
was
undecided
as
to
the
course
he
should
pursue
neutral
vessels
and
manned
by
young
naval
officers
were
proposed
and
many
other
plans
were
devised
napoleon
disembarked
on
the
at
the
isle
of
aix
with
acclamations
ringing
on
every
side
he
had
quitted
the
frigates
because
they
refused
to
sail
owing
either
to
the
weakness
of
character
of
the
commandant
or
in
consequence
of
his
receiving
fresh
orders
from
the
provisional
government
many
persons
thought
that
the
enterprise
might
be
undertaken
with
some
probability
of
success
the
wind
however
remained
constantly
in
the
wrong
quarter
las
cases
returned
to
the
bellerophon
at
four
in
the
morning
of
the
to
inquire
whether
any
reply
had
been
received
to
the
communication
made
by
napoleon
captain
maitland
stated
that
he
expected
to
receive
it
every
moment
and
added
that
if
the
emperor
would
then
embark
for
england
he
was
authorized
to
convey
him
thither
he
added
moreover
that
in
his
own
opinion
and
many
other
officers
present
concurred
with
him
be
had
no
doubt
napoleon
would
be
treated
in
england
with
attention
and
respect
that
in
england
neither
the
king
nor
ministers
exercised
the
same
arbitrary
power
as
on
the
continent
that
the
english
indeed
possessed
generosity
of
sentiment
and
a
liberality
of
opinions
superior
even
to
those
of
the
king
las
cases
replied
that
he
would
make
napoleon
acquainted
with
captain
offer
and
added
that
he
thought
the
emperor
would
not
hesitate
to
proceed
to
england
so
as
to
be
able
to
continue
his
voyage
to
the
united
states
he
described
france
south
of
the
loire
to
be
in
commotion
the
hopes
of
the
people
resting
on
napoleon
as
long
as
he
was
present
the
propositions
everywhere
made
to
him
and
at
every
moment
his
decided
resolution
not
to
become
the
pretest
of
a
civil
war
the
generosity
he
had
exhibited
in
abdicating
in
order
to
render
the
conclusion
of
a
peace
more
practicable
and
his
settled
determination
to
banish
himself
in
order
to
render
that
peace
more
prompt
and
more
lasting
the
messengers
returned
to
their
master
who
after
some
doubt
and
hesitation
despatched
general
gourgaud
with
the
following
letter
to
the
prince
regent
rochefort
july
royal
highness
a
victim
to
the
factions
which
divide
my
country
and
to
the
hostility
of
the
greatest
powers
of
europe
i
have
terminated
my
political
career
and
come
like
themistocles
to
share
the
hospitality
of
the
british
people
i
place
myself
under
the
protection
of
their
laws
and
i
claim
that
from
your
royal
highness
as
the
most
powerful
the
most
constant
and
the
most
generous
of
my
enemies
signed
napoleon
about
four
las
cases
and
savory
returned
to
the
where
they
had
a
long
conversation
with
captain
maitland
in
the
presence
of
captains
sartorius
and
gambler
who
both
declare
that
maitland
repeatedly
warned
napoleon
adherents
not
to
entertain
the
remotest
idea
that
he
was
enabled
to
offer
any
pledge
whatever
to
their
master
beyond
the
simple
assurance
that
he
would
convey
him
in
safety
to
the
english
coast
there
to
await
the
determination
of
the
british
government
napoleon
had
begun
to
prepare
for
his
embarkation
before
daylight
on
the
it
was
time
that
he
did
so
for
a
messenger
charged
with
orders
to
arrest
him
had
already
arrived
at
rochefort
from
the
new
government
the
execution
of
this
order
was
delayed
by
general
becker
for
a
few
hours
in
order
to
allow
napoleon
sufficient
time
to
escape
at
daybreak
he
quitted
the
and
was
enthusiastically
cheered
by
the
company
so
long
as
the
boat
was
within
hearing
soon
after
six
he
was
received
on
board
the
with
respectful
silence
but
without
those
honours
generally
paid
to
persons
of
high
rank
bonaparte
was
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
the
a
cheval
of
the
imperial
guard
and
wore
the
grand
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
on
entering
the
vessel
he
took
off
his
hat
and
addressing
captain
maitland
said
i
am
come
to
throw
myself
on
the
protection
of
the
laws
of
england
napoleon
manner
was
well
calculated
to
make
a
favourable
impression
on
those
with
whom
he
conversed
he
requested
to
be
introduced
to
the
officers
of
the
ship
and
put
various
questions
to
each
he
then
went
round
the
ship
although
he
was
informed
that
the
men
were
cleaning
and
scouring
and
remarked
upon
anything
which
struck
him
as
differing
from
what
he
had
seen
on
french
vessels
the
clean
appearance
of
the
men
surprised
him
he
then
observed
says
captain
maitland
to
whose
interesting
narrative
we
refer
can
see
no
sufficient
reason
why
your
ships
should
beat
the
french
ones
with
so
much
ease
the
finest
in
your
service
are
french
a
french
ship
is
heavier
in
every
respect
than
one
of
yours
she
carries
more
guns
and
those
guns
are
of
a
larger
calibre
and
she
has
a
great
many
more
men
his
inquiries
which
were
minute
proved
that
he
had
directed
much
attention
to
the
french
navy
on
the
first
morning
napoleon
took
breakfast
in
the
english
fashion
but
observing
that
his
distinguished
prisoner
did
not
eat
much
captain
maitland
gave
direction
that
for
the
future
a
hot
breakfast
should
be
served
up
after
the
french
manner
superb
the
admiral
ship
which
had
been
seen
in
the
morning
was
now
approaching
immediately
on
her
anchoring
captain
maitland
went
on
board
to
give
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
and
received
the
admiral
approbation
of
what
he
had
done
in
the
afternoon
admiral
sir
henry
hotham
was
introduced
to
napoleon
and
invited
by
him
to
dinner
this
was
arranged
in
order
to
make
it
more
agreeable
to
him
by
bonaparte
maitre
on
dinner
being
announced
napoleon
led
the
way
and
seated
himself
in
the
centre
at
one
side
of
the
table
desiring
sir
henry
hotham
to
take
the
seat
on
his
right
and
madame
bertrand
that
on
his
left
hand
on
this
day
captain
maitland
took
his
seat
at
the
end
of
the
table
but
on
the
following
day
by
napoleon
request
he
placed
himself
on
his
right
hand
whilst
general
bertrand
took
the
top
two
of
the
ship
officers
dined
with
the
emperor
daily
by
express
invitation
the
conversation
of
napoleon
was
animated
he
made
many
inquiries
as
to
the
family
and
connections
of
captain
maitland
and
in
alluding
to
lord
lauderdale
who
was
sent
as
ambassador
to
paris
during
the
administration
of
fox
paid
that
nobleman
some
compliments
and
said
of
the
then
premier
had
fox
lived
it
never
would
have
come
to
this
but
his
death
put
an
end
to
all
hopes
of
peace
on
one
occasion
he
ordered
his
to
be
displayed
for
the
inspection
of
the
english
officers
in
two
small
leather
packages
were
comprised
the
couch
of
the
once
mighty
ruler
of
the
continent
the
steel
bedstead
which
when
folded
up
was
only
two
feet
long
and
eighteen
inches
wide
occupied
one
case
while
the
other
contained
the
mattress
and
curtains
the
whole
was
so
contrived
as
to
be
ready
for
use
in
three
minutes
napoleon
spoke
in
terms
of
high
praise
of
the
marines
on
duty
in
the
bellerophon
and
on
going
through
their
ranks
exclaimed
to
bertrand
how
much
might
be
done
with
a
hundred
thousand
such
soldiers
as
these
in
putting
them
through
their
exercise
he
drew
a
contrast
between
the
charge
of
the
bayonet
as
made
by
the
english
and
the
french
and
observed
that
the
english
method
of
fixing
the
bayonet
was
faulty
as
it
might
easily
be
twisted
off
when
in
close
action
in
visiting
admiral
the
he
manifested
the
same
active
curiosity
as
in
former
instances
and
made
the
same
minute
inquiries
into
everything
by
which
he
was
surrounded
during
breakfast
one
of
napoleon
suite
colonel
planat
was
much
affected
and
even
wept
on
witnessing
the
humiliation
of
his
master
on
the
return
of
bonaparte
from
the
superb
to
the
the
latter
ship
was
got
under
weigh
and
made
sail
for
england
when
passing
within
a
cable
length
of
the
napoleon
inquired
of
captain
maitland
if
he
thought
that
distance
was
sufficient
for
action
the
reply
of
the
english
officer
was
characteristic
he
told
the
emperor
that
half
the
distance
or
even
less
would
suit
much
better
speaking
of
sir
sidney
smith
bonaparte
repeated
the
anecdote
connected
with
his
quarrel
at
jean
with
that
officer
which
has
already
been
related
in
one
of
the
notes
earlier
in
these
volumes
patting
captain
maitland
on
the
shoulder
he
observed
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
english
navy
he
would
have
been
emperor
of
the
east
but
that
wherever
he
went
he
was
sure
to
find
english
ships
in
the
way
the
with
bonaparte
on
board
sighted
the
coast
of
england
on
sunday
the
of
july
and
at
daybreak
on
the
the
vessel
approached
dartmouth
no
sooner
had
the
ship
anchored
than
an
order
from
loral
keith
was
delivered
to
captain
maitland
from
which
the
following
is
an
extract

of
an
order
from
admiral
viscount
keith
addressed
to
captain
maitland
of
bellerophon
dated
ville
de
paris
hamoaze
july
captain
sartorius
of
his
majesty
ship
delivered
to
me
last
night
at
eleven
your
despatch
of
the
instant
acquainting
me
that
bonaparte
had
proposed
to
embark
on
board
the
ship
you
command
and
that
you
had
acceded
thereto
with
the
intention
of
proceeding
to
torbay
there
to
wait
for
further
orders
i
lost
no
time
in
forwarding
your
letter
by
captain
sartorius
to
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
in
order
that
their
lordships
might
through
him
be
acquainted
with
every
circumstance
that
had
occurred
on
an
occasion
of
so
much
importance
and
you
may
expect
orders
from
their
lordships
for
your
further
guidance
you
are
to
remain
in
torbay
until
you
receive
such
orders
and
in
the
meantime
in
addition
to
the
directions
already
in
your
possession
you
are
most
positively
ordered
to
prevent
every
person
whatever
from
coming
on
board
the
ship
you
command
except
the
officers
and
men
who
compose
her
crew
nor
is
any
person
whatever
whether
in
his
majesty
service
or
not
who
does
not
belong
to
the
ship
to
be
suffered
to
come
on
board
either
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
officers
or
on
any
pretence
whatever
without
express
permission
either
from
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
or
from
me
as
i
understand
from
captain
sartorius
that
general
gourgaud
refused
to
deliver
the
letter
with
which
he
was
charged
for
the
prince
regent
to
any
person
except
his
royal
highness
you
are
to
take
him
out
of
the
into
the
ship
you
command
until
you
receive
directions
from
the
admiralty
on
the
subject
and
order
that
ship
back
to
plymouth
sound
when
captain
sartorius
returns
from
london
it
was
stated
about
this
time
in
some
of
the
english
newspapers
that
helena
would
be
the
place
of
exile
of
the
the
bare
report
of
which
evidently
caused
great
pain
to
napoleon
and
his
suite
general
gourgaud
was
obliged
to
return
to
the
not
having
been
suffered
to
go
on
shore
to
deliver
the
letter
from
bonaparte
to
the
prince
regent
with
which
be
had
been
entrusted
the
ship
which
bore
the
modern
alexander
soon
became
a
natural
object
of
attraction
to
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
was
constantly
surrounded
by
crowds
of
boats
napoleon
frequently
showed
himself
to
the
people
from
shore
with
a
view
of
gratifying
their
curiosity
on
the
of
july
the
number
of
boats
which
surrounded
the
vessel
was
greatly
increased
and
the
alarm
of
the
captives
became
greater
as
the
report
was
strengthened
as
to
the
intention
of
conveying
bonaparte
to
helena
in
conversation
with
captain
maitland
napoleon
who
seemed
to
be
aware
that
the
english
fishermen
united
the
occupation
of
smugglers
to
their
usual
trade
stated
that
many
of
them
had
been
bribed
by
him
and
had
assisted
in
the
escape
of
french
prisoners
of
war
they
had
even
proposed
to
deliver
louis
xviii
into
his
power
but
as
they
would
answer
for
the
safety
of
his
life
napoleon
refused
the
offer
upon
the
arrival
of
despatches
from
london
the
got
under
weigh
for
plymouth
sound
on
the
of
july
this
movement
tended
still
further
to
disconcert
the
and
his
followers
in
passing
the
breakwater
bonaparte
could
not
withhold
his
admiration
of
that
work
which
he
considered
highly
honourable
to
the
public
spirit
of
the
nation
and
alluding
to
his
own
improvements
at
cherbourg
expressed
his
apprehensions
that
they
would
now
be
suffered
to
fall
into
decay
captain
maitland
was
directed
by
lord
keith
to
observe
the
utmost
vigilance
to
prevent
the
escape
of
his
prisoners
and
with
this
view
no
boat
was
permitted
to
approach
the
bellerophon
the
and
were
ordered
to
take
up
an
anchorage
on
each
side
of
the
ship
and
further
precautions
were
adopted
at
night
on
the
of
july
captain
maitland
proceeded
to
lord
keith
taking
with
him
bonaparte
original
letter
to
the
prince
regent
which
as
general
gourgaud
had
not
been
permitted
to
deliver
it
personally
napoleon
now
desired
to
be
transmitted
through
the
hands
of
the
admiral
as
lord
keith
had
now
received
instructions
from
his
government
as
to
the
manner
in
which
napoleon
was
to
be
treated
he
lost
no
time
in
paying
his
respects
to
the
fallen
chief
on
the
of
july
the
order
of
the
english
government
arrived
in
this
document
wherein
the
was
styled
general
bonaparte
it
was
notified
that
he
was
to
be
exiled
to
helena
the
place
of
all
others
most
dreaded
by
him
and
his
devoted
adherents
it
was
moreover
specified
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
take
with
him
three
officers
and
his
surgeon
and
twelve
servants
to
his
own
selection
was
conceded
the
choice
of
these
followers
with
the
exclusion
however
of
savary
and
lallemand
who
were
on
no
account
to
be
permitted
any
further
to
share
his
fortunes
this
prohibition
gave
considerable
alarm
to
those
individuals
who
became
excessively
anxious
as
to
their
future
disposal
and
declared
that
to
deliver
them
up
to
the
vengeance
of
the
bourbons
would
be
a
violation
of
faith
and
honour
napoleon
himself
complained
bitterly
on
the
subject
of
his
destination
and
said
the
idea
of
it
is
horrible
to
me
to
be
placed
for
life
on
an
island
within
the
tropics
at
an
immense
distance
from
any
land
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
world
and
everything
that
i
hold
dear
in
it
pis
que
la
cage
de
fer
de
tamerlan
i
would
prefer
being
delivered
up
to
the
bourbons
among
other
insults
said
he
but
that
is
a
mere
bagatelle
a
very
secondary
consideration
they
style
me
general
they
can
have
no
right
to
call
me
general
they
may
as
well
call
me
for
i
was
head
of
the
church
as
well
as
of
the
army
if
they
do
not
acknowledge
me
as
emperor
they
ought
as
first
counsul
they
have
sent
ambassadors
to
me
as
such
and
your
king
in
his
letters
styled
me
had
they
confined
me
in
the
tower
of
london
or
one
of
the
fortresses
in
england
though
not
what
i
had
hoped
from
the
generosity
of
the
english
people
i
should
not
have
so
much
cause
of
complaint
but
to
banish
me
to
an
island
within
the
tropics
they
might
as
well
have
signed
my
at
once
for
it
is
impossible
a
man
of
my
habit
of
body
can
live
long
in
such
a
climate
having
so
expressed
himself
he
wrote
a
second
letter
to
the
prince
regent
which
was
forwarded
through
lord
keith
it
was
the
opinion
of
generals
montholon
and
gourgaud
that
bonaparte
would
sooner
kill
himself
than
go
to
helena
this
idea
arose
from
his
having
been
heard
emphatically
to
exclaim
i
will
not
go
to
st
helena
the
generals
indeed
declared
that
were
he
to
give
his
own
consent
to
be
so
exiled
they
would
themselves
prevent
him
in
consequence
of
this
threat
captain
maitland
was
instructed
by
lord
keith
to
tell
those
gentlemen
that
as
the
english
law
awarded
death
to
murderers
the
crime
they
meditated
would
inevitably
conduct
them
to
the
gallows
early
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
the
was
ordered
to
be
ready
at
a
moment
notice
for
sea
the
reason
of
this
was
traced
to
a
circumstance
which
is
conspicuous
among
the
many
remarkable
incidents
by
which
bonaparte
arrival
near
the
english
coast
was
characterised
a
rumour
reached
lord
keith
that
a
corpus
had
been
procured
with
a
view
of
delivering
napoleon
from
the
custody
he
was
then
in
this
however
turned
out
to
be
a
subpoena
for
bonaparte
as
a
witness
at
a
trial
in
the
court
of
king
bench
and
indeed
a
person
attempted
to
get
on
board
the
bellerophon
to
serve
the
document
but
he
was
foiled
in
his
intention
though
had
he
succeeded
the
subpoena
would
in
the
situation
wherein
the
then
stood
have
been
without
avail
on
the
captain
maitland
having
been
summoned
to
the
of
lord
keith
acquainted
general
bertrand
that
he
would
convey
to
the
admiral
anything
which
bonaparte
who
had
expressed
an
urgent
wish
to
see
his
lordship
might
desire
to
say
to
him
bertrand
requested
the
captain
to
delay
his
departure
until
a
document
then
in
preparation
should
be
completed
the
protest
of
his
majesty
the
late
emperor
of
the
french
etc
captain
maitland
denied
that
any
snare
was
laid
for
bonaparte
either
by
himself
or
by
the
english
government
and
stated
that
the
precautions
for
preventing
the
escape
of
napoleon
from
rochefort
were
so
well
ordered
that
it
was
impossible
to
evade
them
and
that
the
fugitive
was
compelled
to
surrender
himself
to
the
english
ship
on
the
of
august
bonaparte
with
the
suite
he
had
selected
was
transferred
from
the
to
the
lord
barge
was
prepared
for
his
conveyance
to
the
latter
vessel
and
his
lordship
was
present
on
the
occasion
a
captain
guard
was
turned
out
and
as
napoleon
left
the
the
marines
presented
arms
and
the
drum
was
beaten
as
usual
in
saluting
a
general
officer
when
he
arrived
on
board
the
northumberland
the
squadron
got
under
weigh
and
napoleon
sailed
for
the
place
of
his
final
exile
and
grave
for
the
continuation
of
napoleon
voyage
