during
the
last
days
of
may
one
of
the
parisian
battalions
introduced
into
brittany
by
santerre
was
reconnoitring
the
formidable
la
saudraie
woods
in
astillé
decimated
by
this
cruel
war
the
battalion
was
reduced
to
about
three
hundred
men
this
was
at
the
time
when
after
argonne
jemmapes
and
valmy
of
the
first
battalion
of
paris
which
had
numbered
six
hundred
volunteers
only
men
remained
of
the
second
and
of
the
third
a
time
of
epic
combats
the
battalion
sent
from
paris
into
la
vendée
numbered
nine
hundred
and
twelve
men
each
regiment
had
three
pieces
of
cannon
they
had
been
quickly
mustered
on
the
of
april
gohier
being
minister
of
justice
and
bouchotte
minister
of
war
the
section
of
bon
conseil
had
offered
to
send
volunteer
battalions
into
la
vendée
the
report
was
made
by
lubin
a
member
of
the
commune
on
the
of
may
santerre
was
ready
to
send
off
twelve
thousand
men
thirty
and
one
battalion
of
gunners
these
battalions
notwithstanding
they
were
so
quickly
formed
serve
as
models
even
at
the
present
day
and
regiments
of
the
line
are
formed
on
the
same
plan
they
altered
the
former
proportion
between
the
number
of
soldiers
and
that
of
officers
on
the
of
april
the
paris
commune
had
given
to
the
volunteers
of
santerre
the
following
order
no
mercy
no
quarter
of
the
twelve
thousand
that
had
left
paris
at
the
end
of
may
eight
thousand
were
dead
the
battalion
which
was
engaged
in
la
saudraie
held
itself
on
its
guard
there
was
no
hurrying
every
man
looked
at
once
to
right
and
to
left
before
him
behind
him
kléber
has
said
the
soldier
has
an
eye
in
his
back
they
had
been
marching
a
long
time
what
could
it
be
what
time
of
the
day
was
it
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
for
there
is
always
a
sort
of
dusk
in
these
wild
thickets
and
it
was
never
light
in
that
wood
the
forest
of
la
saudraie
was
a
tragic
one
it
was
in
this
coppice
that
from
the
month
of
november
civil
war
began
its
crimes
mousqueton
the
fierce
cripple
had
come
forth
from
those
fatal
thickets
the
number
of
murders
that
had
been
committed
there
made
one
hair
stand
on
end
no
spot
was
more
terrible
the
soldiers
forced
cautiously
everything
was
in
full
bloom
they
were
surrounded
by
a
quivering
wall
of
branches
whose
leaves
diffused
a
delicious
freshness
here
and
there
sunbeams
pierced
these
green
shades
at
their
feet
the
gladiolus
the
german
iris
the
wild
narcissus
the
that
tiny
flower
forerunner
of
the
warm
weather
the
spring
crocus
all
these
embroidered
and
adorned
a
thick
carpet
of
vegetation
abounding
in
every
variety
of
moss
from
the
kind
that
looks
like
a
caterpillar
to
that
resembling
a
star
the
soldiers
advanced
silently
step
by
step
gently
pushing
aide
the
underbrush
the
birds
twittered
above
the
bayonets
la
saudraie
was
one
of
those
thickets
where
formerly
in
time
of
peace
they
had
pursued
the
houicheba
the
the
hunting
of
birds
by
night
now
it
was
a
place
for
hunting
men
the
coppice
consisted
entirely
of
beeches
and
oaks
the
ground
was
level
the
moss
and
the
thick
grass
deadened
the
noise
of
footsteps
no
paths
at
all
or
paths
no
sooner
found
than
lost
holly
wild
sloe
brakes
hedges
of
and
tall
brambles
it
was
impossible
to
see
a
man
ten
paces
distant
now
and
then
a
heron
or
a
flew
through
the
branches
showing
the
vicinity
of
a
swamp
they
marched
along
at
haphazard
uneasy
and
fearing
lest
they
might
find
what
they
sought
from
time
to
time
they
encountered
traces
of
encampments
a
burnt
place
trampled
grass
sticks
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
cross
or
branches
spattered
with
blood
here
soup
had
been
made
there
mass
had
been
said
yonder
wounds
had
been
dressed
but
whoever
had
passed
that
way
had
vanished
where
were
they
far
away
perhaps
and
yet
they
might
be
very
near
hiding
blunderbuss
in
hand
the
wood
seemed
deserted
the
battalion
redoubled
its
precaution
solitude
therefore
distrust
no
one
was
to
be
seen
all
the
more
reason
to
fear
some
one
they
had
to
do
with
a
forest
of
illustration
an
ambush
was
probable
thirty
grenadiers
detached
as
scouts
and
commanded
by
a
sergeant
marched
ahead
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
main
body
the
vivandière
of
the
battalion
accompanied
them
the
vivandières
like
to
join
the
vanguard
they
run
risks
but
then
they
stand
a
chance
of
seeing
something
curiosity
is
one
of
the
forms
of
feminine
courage
suddenly
the
soldiers
of
this
little
advanced
guard
received
that
shock
familiar
to
hunters
which
shows
them
that
they
are
close
upon
the
lair
of
their
prey
they
heard
something
like
breathing
in
the
middle
of
the
thicket
and
it
seemed
as
if
they
caught
sight
of
some
commotion
among
the
leaves
the
soldiers
made
signs
to
each
other
when
this
mode
of
watching
and
reconnoitring
is
confided
to
the
scouts
officers
have
no
need
to
interfere
what
has
to
be
done
is
done
instinctively
in
less
than
a
minute
the
spot
where
the
movement
had
been
observed
was
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
levelled
muskets
aimed
simultaneously
from
every
side
at
the
dusky
centre
of
the
thicket
and
the
soldiers
with
finger
on
trigger
and
eye
on
the
suspected
spot
awaited
only
the
sergeant
command
to
fire
meanwhile
the
vivandière
ventured
to
peer
through
the
underbush
and
just
as
the
sergeant
was
about
to
cry
fire
this
woman
cried
halt
and
turning
to
the
soldiers
do
not
fire
she
cried
and
rushed
into
the
thicket
followed
by
the
men
there
was
indeed
some
one
there
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
copse
on
the
edge
of
one
of
those
small
circular
clearings
made
in
the
woods
by
the
that
are
used
to
burn
the
roots
of
trees
in
a
sort
of
hole
formed
by
the
branches
a
bower
of
foliage
so
to
speak
like
an
alcove
sat
a
woman
on
the
moss
with
a
nursing
child
at
her
breast
and
the
fair
heads
of
two
sleeping
children
resting
against
her
knees
illustration
this
was
the
ambush
what
are
you
doing
here
called
out
the
vivandière
the
woman
raised
her
head
and
the
former
added
angrily
are
you
insane
to
remain
there
she
went
on
a
little
more
and
you
would
have
been
blown
to
atoms
then
addressing
the
soldiers
she
said
it
a
woman
pardieu
that
plain
to
be
seen
replied
a
grenadier
the
vivandière
continued
to
come
into
the
woods
to
get
oneself
massacred
can
you
conceive
of
any
one
so
stupid
as
that
the
woman
surprised
bewildered
and
stunned
was
gazing
around
as
though
in
a
dream
at
these
muskets
sabres
bayonets
and
savage
faces
the
two
children
awoke
and
began
to
cry
i
am
hungry
said
one
i
am
afraid
said
the
other
the
baby
went
on
nursing
the
vivandière
addressed
it
you
are
the
wise
one
she
said
the
mother
was
dumb
with
terror
do
be
afraid
exclaimed
the
sergeant
we
are
the
battalion
of
the
bonnet
rouge
the
woman
trembled
from
head
to
foot
she
looked
at
the
sergeant
of
whose
rough
face
she
could
see
only
the
eyebrows
moustache
and
eyes
like
two
coals
of
fire
the
battalion
formerly
known
as
the
added
the
vivandière
the
sergeant
continued
who
are
you
madam
the
woman
looked
at
him
in
terror
she
was
thin
young
pale
and
in
tatters
she
wore
the
large
hood
and
woollen
cloak
of
the
breton
peasants
fastened
by
a
string
around
her
neck
she
left
her
bosom
exposed
with
the
indifference
of
an
animal
her
feet
without
shoes
or
stockings
were
bleeding
it
a
beggar
said
the
sergeant
the
vivandière
continued
in
her
martial
yet
womanly
voice
a
gentle
voice
withal
what
is
your
name
the
woman
stammered
in
a
scarce
audible
whisper
michelle
fléchard
meanwhile
the
vivandière
stroked
the
little
head
of
the
nursing
baby
with
her
large
hand
how
old
is
this
midget
she
asked
the
mother
did
not
understand
the
vivandière
repeated
i
ask
you
how
old
it
is
oh
eighteen
months
said
the
mother
that
quite
old
said
the
vivandière
it
ought
not
to
nurse
any
longer
you
must
wean
it
we
will
give
him
soup
the
mother
began
to
feel
more
at
ease
the
two
little
ones
who
had
awakened
were
rather
interested
than
frightened
they
admired
the
plumes
of
the
soldiers
ah
they
are
very
hungry
said
the
mother
and
she
added
i
have
no
more
milk
we
will
give
them
food
cried
the
sergeant
and
you
also
but
there
is
something
more
to
be
settled
what
are
your
political
opinions
the
woman
looked
at
him
and
made
no
reply
do
you
understand
my
question
she
stammered
i
was
put
into
a
convent
when
i
was
quite
young
but
i
married
i
am
not
a
nun
the
sisters
taught
me
to
speak
french
the
village
was
set
on
fire
we
escaped
in
such
haste
that
i
had
no
time
to
put
my
shoes
on
i
ask
you
what
are
your
political
opinions
i
do
know
anything
about
that
the
sergeant
continued
there
are
female
spies
that
kind
of
person
we
shoot
come
speak
you
are
not
a
gypsy
are
you
what
is
your
native
land
she
still
looked
at
him
as
though
unable
to
comprehend
the
sergeant
repeated
what
is
your
native
land
i
do
not
know
she
said
how
is
that
you
do
not
know
your
country
ah
do
you
mean
my
country
i
know
that
well
what
is
your
country
the
woman
replied
it
is
the
farm
of
siscoignard
in
the
parish
of
azé
it
was
the
sergeant
turn
to
be
surprised
he
paused
for
a
moment
lost
in
thought
then
he
went
on
what
was
it
you
said
siscoignard
you
can
not
call
that
your
native
land
that
is
my
country
then
after
a
minute
consideration
she
added
i
understand
you
sir
you
are
from
france
but
i
am
from
brittany
well
it
is
not
the
same
country
but
it
is
the
same
native
land
exclaimed
the
sergeant
the
woman
only
replied
i
am
from
siscoignard
let
it
be
siscoignard
then
said
the
sergeant
your
family
belong
there
i
suppose
yes
what
is
their
business
they
are
all
dead
i
have
no
one
left
the
sergeant
who
was
quite
loquacious
continued
to
question
her
devil
take
it
every
one
has
relations
or
one
has
had
them
who
are
you
speak
the
woman
listened
bewildered
this
or
one
has
had
them
sounded
more
like
the
cry
of
a
wild
beast
than
the
speech
of
a
human
being
the
vivandière
felt
obliged
to
interfere
she
began
to
caress
the
nursing
child
and
patted
the
other
two
on
the
cheeks
what
is
the
baby
name
it
a
little
girl
is
it
the
mother
replied
georgette
and
the
oldest
one
for
he
is
a
man
the
rogue
and
the
younger
one
for
he
is
a
man
too
and
a
chubby
one
into
the
bargain
replied
the
mother
they
are
pretty
children
said
the
vivandière
they
look
already
as
if
they
were
somebody
meanwhile
the
sergeant
persisted
come

you
a
house

had
one
once
where

it
at
azé
why

blues
or
the
whites
which

on

children
there
was
a
pause
the
vivandière
spoke
for
my
part
i
never
had
any
children
i
have
not
had
time
the
sergeant
began
again
but

facts
about

my

these
fléchards
of
yours
they
were
laborers
my
father
was
feeble
and
could
not
work
on
account
of
a
beating
which
the
lord
his
lord
our
lord
gave
him
it
was
really
a
mercy
for
my
father
had
poached
a
rabbit
a
crime
of
which
the
penalty
is
death
but
the
lord
was
merciful
and
said
may
give
him
only
a
hundred
blows
with
a
stick
and
my
father
was
left
a
cripple
and
then
my
grandfather
was
a
huguenot
the
curé
had
him
sent
to
the
galleys
i
was
very
young
then
and
then
my
husband
father
was
a
salt
smuggler
the
king
had
him
hung
and
what
did
your
husband
do
he
used
to
fight
in
those
times
for
whom
for
the
king
and
after
that
ah
for
his
lord
and
then
for
the
curé
by
all
the
names
of
beasts
cried
the
grenadier
the
woman
jumped
in
terror
you
see
madam
we
are
parisians
said
the
vivandière
affably
the
woman
clasped
her
hands
exclaiming
oh
my
god
and
lord
jesus
no
superstitions
here
rejoined
the
sergeant
the
vivandière
sat
down
beside
the
woman
and
drew
the
oldest
child
between
her
knees
he
yielded
readily
children
are
quite
as
easily
reassured
as
they
are
frightened
with
no
apparent
reason
they
seem
to
possess
instinctive
perceptions
my
poor
worthy
woman
of
this
neighborhood

pretty
little
children

all
events

little
rascal

to
join

battalion

i
do
my
name
is
housarde
it
a
nickname
but
i
had
rather
be
called
housarde
than
mamzelle
bicorneau
like
my
mother
i
am
the
canteen
woman
which
is
the
same
as
saying
she

the
men
to
drink

and
killing

devil

all
his
train

about
the
same
size
i
will
give

a
pair
of
my
shoes
i
was
in
paris
on
the
of
august
i
gave
westerman
a
drink
everything
went
with
a
rush
in
those
days
i
saw
louis
xvi
guillotined
louis
capet
as
they
call
him
i
tell
you
he
did
like
it
you
just
listen
now
to
think
that
on
the
of
january
he
was
roasting
chestnuts
and
enjoying
himself
with
his
family
when
he
was
made
to
lie
down
on
what
is
called
the
he
wore
neither
coat
nor
shoes
only
a
shirt
a
quilted
waistcoat
gray
cloth
breeches
and
gray
silk
stockings
i
saw
all
that
with
my
own
eyes
the
fiacre
which
he
rode
in
was
painted
green
now
then
you
come
with
us
they
are
kind
lads
in
the
battalion

will
be
canteen
number
two
i
will
teach
you
the
trade
oh
it
very
simple
you
will
have
a
can
and
a
bell
you
are
right
in
the
racket
amid
the
firing
of
the
platoons
and
the
cannons
in
all
that
hubbub
calling
out
wants
a
drink
my
children
it
is
no
harder
task
than
that
i
offer
a
drink
to
all
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
to
the
whites
as
well
as
to
the
blues
although
i
am
a
blue
and
a
true
blue
at
that
but
i
serve
them
all
alike
wounded
men
are
thirsty
people
die
without
difference
of
opinions
dying
men
ought
to
shake
hands
how
foolish
to
fight
come
with
us
if
i
am
killed
you
will
fill
my
place
you
see
i
am
not
much
to
look
at
but
i
am
a
kind
woman
and
a
good
fellow
do
be
afraid
when
the
vivandière
ceased
speaking
the
woman
muttered
to
herself
our
neighbor
name
was
and
it
was
our
servant
who
was
meanwhile
sergeant
radoub
was
reprimanding
the
grenadier
silence
you
frighten
madam
a
man
should
not
swear
before
ladies
i
say
this
is
a
downright
butchery
for
an
honest
man
to
hear
about
replied
the
grenadier
and
to
see
chinese
iroquois
whose
was
crippled
by
the
lord
whose
grandfather
was
sent
to
the
galleys
by
the
curé
and
whose
father
was
hung
by
the
king
and
who
fight
zounds
and
who
get
entangled
in
revolts
and
are
crushed
for
the
sake
of
the
lord
the
curé
and
the
king
silence
in
the
ranks
exclaimed
the
sergeant
one
may
be
silent
sergeant
continued
the
grenadier
but
it
is
all
the
same
provoking
to
see
a
pretty
woman
like
that
running
the
risk
of
getting
her
neck
broken
for
the
sake
of
a
calotin
grenadier
said
the
sergeant
we
are
not
in
the
pike
club
save
your
eloquence
and
turning
to
the
woman
and
your
husband
madam
what
does
he
do
what
has
become
of
him
nothing
since
he
was
killed
where
was
that
in
the
hedge
when
three
days
ago
who
killed
him
i
do
not
know
how
is
that
you
do
know
who
killed
your
husband
no
was
it
a
blue
or
a
white
it
was
a
bullet
was
that
three
days
ago
yes
in
what
direction
towards
ernée
my
husband
fell
that
was
all
and
since
your
husband
died
what
have
you
been
doing
i
have
been
taking
my
little
ones
along
where
are
you
taking
them
straight
along
where
do
you
sleep
on
the
ground
what
do
you
eat
nothing
the
sergeant
made
that
military
grimace
which
elevates
the
moustache
to
the
nose
nothing
well
nothing
but
sloes
blackberries
when
i
found
any
left
over
from
last
year
and
yes
you
may
well
call
it
nothing
the
oldest
child
who
seemed
to
understand
said
i
am
hungry
the
sergeant
pulled
from
his
pocket
a
piece
of
ration
bread
and
handed
it
to
the
mother
taking
the
bread
she
broke
it
in
two
and
gave
it
to
the
children
who
bit
into
it
greedily
she
has
not
saved
any
for
herself
growled
the
sergeant
because
she
is
not
hungry
remarked
a
soldier
because
she
is
a
mother
said
the
sergeant
the
children
broke
in
give
me
something
to
drink
said
one
to
drink
repeated
the
other
is
there
no
brook
in
this
cursed
wood
said
the
sergeant
the
vivandière
took
the
copper
goblet
suspended
at
her
belt
together
with
a
bell
turned
the
cock
of
the
can
that
was
strapped
across
her
shoulder
and
pouring
several
drops
into
the
goblet
held
it
to
the
children
lips
the
first
drank
and
made
a
grimace
the
second
drank
and
spit
it
out
it
is
good
all
the
same
said
the
vivandière
is
that
some
of
the
old
asked
the
sergeant
yes
some
of
the
best
but
they
are
peasants
she
wiped
the
goblet
and
so
madam
you
are
running
away
resumed
the
sergeant
i
could
help
it
across
the
fields
with
no
particular
object
sometimes
i
run
with
all
my
might
and
then
i
walk
and
once
in
a
while
i
fall
poor
countrywoman
said
the
vivandière
they
were
fighting
stammered
the
woman
i
was
in
the
middle
of
the
firing
i
do
know
what
they
want
they
killed
my
husband
that
was
all
i
know
about
it
the
sergeant
banged
the
butt
of
his
musket
on
the
ground
exclaiming
what
a
beast
of
a
war
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
idiotic
the
woman
continued
last
night
we
went
to
bed
in
an
all
four
of
you
all
four
went
to
bed
went
to
bed
then
you
must
have
gone
to
bed
standing
and
he
turned
to
the
soldiers
comrades
a
dead
tree
old
and
hollow
wherein
a
man
can
sheathe
himself
like
a
sword
in
a
scabbard
is
what
these
savages
call
an
but
what
would
you
have
all
are
not
obliged
to
be
parisians
the
idea
of
sleeping
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
and
with
three
children
exclaimed
the
vivandière
and
when
the
little
one
bawled
it
must
have
seemed
queer
to
the
who
could
see
nothing
to
hear
the
tree
calling
out
mamma
fortunately
it
is
said
the
woman
with
a
sigh
she
looked
down
resigned
with
an
expression
in
her
eyes
of
one
who
had
known
surprising
calamities
the
silent
soldiers
surrounded
this
wretched
group
a
widow
three
orphans
flight
desolation
solitude
the
rumblings
of
war
on
the
horizon
hunger
thirst
no
food
but
herbs
no
roof
but
the
sky
the
sergeant
drew
near
the
woman
and
gazed
upon
the
nursing
infant
the
baby
left
the
breast
turned
her
head
and
looked
with
her
lovely
blue
eyes
on
the
dreadful
hairy
face
bristling
and
fierce
that
was
bending
over
her
and
began
to
smile
the
sergeant
drew
back
and
a
large
tear
was
seen
to
roll
down
his
cheek
clinging
to
the
end
of
his
moustache
like
a
pearl
he
raised
his
voice
comrades
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
battalion
is
about
to
become
a
father
are
you
willing
we
adopt
these
three
children
hurrah
for
the
republic
shouted
the
grenadiers
so
be
it
exclaimed
the
sergeant
and
he
stretched
out
both
hands
over
the
mother
and
the
children
behold
the
children
of
the
battalion
of
the
he
said
the
vivandière
jumped
for
joy
three
heads
under
one
cap
she
cried
then
she
burst
out
sobbing
and
embraced
the
widow
excitedly
saying
she
looks
like
a
rogue
already
that
little
girl
hurrah
for
the
republic
repeated
the
soldiers
come
citizeness
said
the
sergeant
to
the
mother
footnote
the
sergeant
makes
a
pun
on
the
name
fléchard
which
is
untranslatable
flèche
means
arrow

he
asks

england
and
france
united
in
the
spring
of
when
france
attacked
at
one
and
the
same
time
on
all
her
frontiers
experienced
the
pathetic
diversion
of
the
downfall
of
the
girondists
the
following
events
were
taking
place
in
the
channel
islands
in
jersey
one
evening
on
the
first
of
june
about
an
hour
before
sunset
from
the
lovely
little
bay
of
bonnenuit
a
corvette
set
sail
in
that
foggy
kind
of
weather
dangerous
for
navigation
and
for
that
very
reason
better
suited
for
escape
than
for
pursuit
the
ship
although
it
was
manned
by
a
french
crew
belonged
to
the
english
squadron
which
had
been
stationed
to
watch
the
eastern
point
of
the
island
the
prince
of
tour
of
the
house
of
bouillon
commanded
the
english
fleet
and
it
was
by
his
order
and
for
a
special
and
pressing
service
that
the
corvette
had
been
detached
this
corvette
entered
at
the
trinity
house
under
the
name
of
the
claymore
and
apparently
a
freight
vessel
was
in
point
of
fact
a
she
looked
like
a
heavy
and
peaceable
but
it
would
not
have
been
wise
to
trust
to
that
for
she
had
been
built
to
serve
two
purposes
cunning
and
strength
to
deceive
if
possible
to
fight
if
necessary
for
the
service
on
hand
that
night
the
freight
between
decks
had
been
replaced
by
thirty
carronades
of
heavy
caliber
either
for
the
sake
of
giving
the
ship
a
peaceable
appearance
or
possibly
because
a
storm
was
anticipated
these
thirty
carronades
were
housed
that
is
they
were
firmly
fastened
inside
by
triple
chains
with
their
muzzles
tightly
braced
against
the
nothing
could
be
seen
from
the
outside
the
were
closed
it
was
as
though
the
corvette
wore
a
mask
these
guns
were
mounted
on
bronzed
wheels
called
the
radiating
model
the
regular
naval
corvettes
carry
their
guns
on
the
upper
deck
but
this
ship
built
for
surprise
and
ambush
had
its
decks
clear
having
been
arranged
as
we
have
just
seen
to
carry
a
masked
battery
between
decks
the
claymore
although
built
in
a
heavy
and
clumsy
fashion
was
nevertheless
a
good
sailer
her
hull
being
one
of
the
strongest
in
the
english
navy
and
in
an
engagement
she
was
almost
equal
to
a
frigate
although
her
was
only
a
small
one
with
a
fore
and
aft
rig
her
rudder
of
an
odd
and
scientific
shape
had
a
curved
frame
quite
unique
which
had
cost
fifty
pounds
sterling
in
the
southampton
shipyards
the
crew
entirely
french
was
composed
of
refugee
officers
and
sailors
who
were
deserters
they
were
experienced
men
there
was
not
one
among
them
who
was
not
a
good
sailor
a
good
soldier
and
a
good
royalist
a
threefold
fanaticism
possessed
them
for
the
ship
the
sword
and
the
king
half
a
battalion
of
marines
which
could
in
case
of
necessity
be
disembarked
was
added
to
the
crew
the
captain
of
the
claymore
was
a
chevalier
of
count
boisberthelot
one
of
the
best
officers
of
the
old
royal
navy
the
first
officer
was
the
chevalier
de
la
vieuville
who
had
commanded
in
the
french
guards
the
company
of
which
hoche
was
sergeant
and
the
pilot
philip
gacquoil
was
one
of
the
most
experienced
in
jersey
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
the
ship
had
some
unusual
work
to
do
in
fact
a
man
had
just
stepped
on
board
who
had
the
look
of
one
starting
out
for
an
adventure
he
was
an
old
man
tall
upright
and
strong
with
a
severe
countenance
a
man
whose
age
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
determine
for
he
seemed
both
young
and
old
advanced
in
years
yet
abounding
in
vigor
one
of
those
men
whose
eyes
flash
lightning
though
the
hair
is
white
judging
from
his
energy
he
was
about
forty
years
old
his
air
of
authority
was
that
of
a
man
of
eighty
at
the
moment
when
he
stepped
on
board
the
corvette
his
was
revealing
beneath
wide
breeches
called
high
boots
and
a
waistcoat
embroidered
with
silk
on
the
right
side
while
the
rough
and
bristling
fur
was
left
on
the
wrong
side
the
complete
costume
of
a
breton
peasant
these
breton
answered
two
purposes
being
worn
both
on
holidays
and
and
could
be
reversed
at
the
option
of
the
wearer
with
either
the
hairy
or
the
smooth
side
out
fur
on
a
and
gala
attire
for
holidays
and
as
if
to
increase
a
carefully
studied
resemblance
the
peasant
dress
worn
by
the
old
man
was
well
worn
on
the
knees
and
elbows
showing
signs
of
long
usage
and
his
cloak
made
of
coarse
cloth
looked
like
the
garb
of
a
fisherman
he
wore
the
round
hat
of
the
period
tall
and
which
when
turned
down
looks
countrified
but
when
caught
up
on
one
side
by
a
loop
and
a
cockade
has
quite
a
military
effect
he
wore
it
turned
down
country
fashion
with
neither
loop
nor
cockade

the
name
by

called
their
passenger
in

short
dialogues
which
sailors
hold
among
themselves

without
further
information
on

subject
they
understood
that

stopping
at
granville
received
by
a
secret
emissary
the
following
message
in
the
same
handwriting
as
the
previous
one
citizen
representative
the
of
june
at
high
tide
the
war
corvette
with
a
masked
battery
will
set
sail
to

on
the
coast
of
france
a
man
who
answers
to
the
following
description
tall
aged
dressed
like
a
peasant
and
with
the
hands
of
an
aristocrat
i
will
send
you
further
details

will
land
on
the
morning
of

the

and
the
passenger

the
corvette
instead
of
sailing
south
in
the
direction
of
catherine
headed
to
the
north
then
veering
towards
the
west
had
boldly
entered
that
arm
of
the
sea
between
sark
and
jersey
called
the
passage
of
the
déroute
there
was
then
no
lighthouse
at
any
point
on
either
coast
it
had
been
a
clear
sunset
the
night
was
darker
than
summer
nights
usually
are
it
was
moonlight
but
large
clouds
rather
of
the
equinox
than
of
the
solstice
overspread
the
sky
and
judging
by
appearances
the
moon
would
not
be
visible
until
she
reached
the
horizon
at
the
moment
of
setting
a
few
clouds
hung
low
near
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
covered
it
with
vapor
all
this
darkness
was
favorable
gacquoil
the
pilot
intended
to
leave
jersey
on
the
left
guernsey
on
the
right
and
by
boldly
sailing
between
hanois
and
dover
to
reach
some
bay
on
the
coast
near
malo
a
longer
but
safer
route
than
the
one
through
minquiers
for
the
french
coaster
had
standing
orders
to
keep
an
unusually
sharp
lookout
between
hélier
and
granville
if
the
wind
were
favorable
and
nothing
happened
by
dint
of
setting
all
sail
gacquoil
hoped
to
reach
the
coast
of
france
at
daybreak
all
went
well
the
corvette
had
just
passed
gros
nez
towards
nine
the
weather
looked
sullen
as
the
sailors
express
it
both
wind
and
sea
rising
but
the
wind
was
favorable
and
the
sea
was
rough
yet
not
heavy
waves
now
and
then
dashing
over
the
bow
of
the
corvette
the
peasant
whom
lord
balcarras
had
called
general
and
whom
the
prince
de
la
tour
had
addressed
as
cousin
was
a
good
sailor
and
paced
the
deck
of
the
corvette
with
calm
dignity
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
that
she
rocked
considerably
from
time
to
time
he
took
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
cake
of
chocolate
and
breaking
off
a
piece
munched
it
though
his
hair
was
gray
his
teeth
were
sound
he
spoke
to
no
one
except
that
from
time
to
time
he
made
a
few
concise
remarks
in
an
undertone
to
the
captain
who
listened
to
him
deferentially
apparently
regarding
his
passenger
as
the
commander
rather
than
himself
unobserved
in
the
fog
and
skilfully
piloted
the
claymore
coasted
along
the
steep
shore
to
the
north
of
jersey
hugging
the
land
to
avoid
the
formidable
reef
of
which
lies
in
the
middle
of
the
strait
between
jersey
and
sark
gacquoil
at
the
helm
sighting
in
turn
grove
de
leeq
gros
nez
and
plémont
making
the
corvette
glide
in
among
those
chains
of
reefs
felt
his
way
along
to
a
certain
extent
but
with
the
of
one
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
sea
the
corvette
had
no
light
forward
fearing
to
betray
its
passage
through
these
guarded
waters
they
congratulated
themselves
on
the
fog
the
grande
étape
was
reached
the
mist
was
so
dense
that
the
lofty
outlines
of
the
pinnacle
were
scarcely
visible
they
heard
it
strike
ten
from
the
belfry
of
a
sign
that
the
wind
was
still
aft
all
was
going
well
the
sea
grew
rougher
because
they
were
drawing
near
la
corbière
a
little
after
ten
the
count
boisberthelot
and
the
chevalier
de
la
vieuville
escorted
the
man
in
the
peasant
garb
to
the
door
of
his
cabin
which
was
the
captain
own
room
as
he
was
about
to
enter
he
remarked
lowering
his
voice
you
understand
the
importance
of
keeping
the
secret
gentlemen
silence
up
to
the
moment
of
explosion
you
are
the
only
ones
here
who
know
my
name
we
will
carry
it
to
the
grave
replied
boisberthelot
and
for
my
part
i
would
not
reveal
it
were
i
face
to
face
with
death
remarked
the
old
man
and
he
entered
his
iii
patrician
and
plebeian
united
the
commander
and
the
first
officer
returned
on
deck
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
side
by
side
talking
as
they
walked
the
theme
was
evidently
their
passenger
and
this
was
the
substance
of
the
conversation
which
the
wind
wafted
through
the
darkness
boisberthelot
grumbled
half
audibly
to
la
vieuville
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
or
no
he
is
a
leader
la
vieuville
replied
meanwhile
he
is
a
prince
almost
a
nobleman
in
france
but
a
prince
in
brittany
like
the
trémoilles
and
the
rohans
with
whom
he
is
connected
boisberthelot
resumed
in
france
and
in
the
carriages
of
the
king
he
is
a
marquis
as
i
am
a
count
and
you
a
chevalier
the
carriages
are
far
away
exclaimed
vieuville
we
are
living
in
the
time
of
the
tumbril
a
silence
ensued
boisberthelot
went
on
for
lack
of
a
french
prince
we
take
one
from
brittany
for
lack
of
thrushes
no
since
an
eagle
is
not
to
be
found
we
take
a
crow
i
should
prefer
a
vulture
remarked
boisberthelot
la
vieuville
replied
yes
indeed
with
a
beak
and
talons
we
shall
see
yes
replied
vieuville
it
is
time
there
was
a
leader
i
agree
with
tinténiac
a
leader
and
see
here
commander
i
know
nearly
all
the
possible
and
impossible
leaders
those
of
yesterday
those
of
and
those
of
not
one
of
them
has
the
head
required
for
war
in
this
cursed
vendée
a
general
is
needed
who
would
be
a
lawyer
as
well
as
a
leader
he
must
harass
the
enemy
dispute
every
bush
ditch
and
stone
he
must
force
unlucky
quarrels
upon
him
and
take
advantage
of
everything
vigilant
and
pitiless
he
must
watch
incessantly
slaughter
freely
and
make
examples
now
in
this
army
of
peasants
there
are
heroes
but
no
captains
is
a
nonentity
lescure
an
invalid
bonchamps
is
merciful
he
is
kind
and
that
implies
folly
la
rochejaquelein
is
a
superb
silz
is
an
officer
good
for
the
open
field
but
not
suited
for
a
war
that
needs
a
man
of
expedients
cathelineau
is
a
simple
teamster
stofflet
is
a
crafty
bérard
is
inefficient
boulainvilliers
is
absurd
charette
is
horrible
i
make
no
mention
of
gaston
the
barber
mordemonbleu
what
is
the
use
of
opposing
revolution
and
what
is
the
difference
between
ourselves
and
the
republicans
if
we
set
barbers
over
the
heads
of
noblemen
the
fact
is
that
this
beastly
revolution
has
contaminated
all
of
us
it
is
the
itch
of
france
it
is
the
itch
of
the
tiers
état
rejoined
boisberthelot
england
alone
can
help
us
and
she
will
captain
undoubtedly
meanwhile
it
is
an
ugly
state
of
affairs
yes
rustics
everywhere
a
monarchy
that
has
stofflet
the
of
de
maulevrier
for
a
commander
has
no
reason
to
envy
a
republic
whose
minister
is
pache
the
son
of
the
duke
de
porter
what
men
this
vendean
war
brings
face
to
face
one
side
santerre
the
brewer
on
the
other
gaston
the
hairdresser
my
dear
la
vieuville
i
feel
some
respect
for
this
gaston
he
behaved
well
in
his
command
of
guéménée
he
had
three
hundred
blues
neatly
shot
after
making
them
dig
their
own
graves
well
enough
done
but
i
could
have
done
quite
as
well
as
he
pardieu
to
be
sure
and
i
too
the
great
feats
of
war
said
vieuville
require
noble
blood
in
those
who
perform
them
these
are
matters
for
knights
and
not
for
hairdressers
but
yet
there
are
estimable
men
in
this
estate
rejoined
vieuville
take
that
watchmaker
joly
for
instance
he
was
formerly
a
sergeant
in
a
flanders
regiment
he
becomes
a
vendean
chief
and
commander
of
a
coast
band
he
has
a
son
a
republican
and
while
the
father
serves
in
the
ranks
of
the
whites
the
son
serves
in
those
of
the
blues
an
encounter
a
battle
the
father
captures
the
son
and
blows
out
his
brains
illustration
he
did
well
said
la
vieuville
a
royalist
brutus
answered
boisberthelot
nevertheless
it
is
unendurable
to
be
under
the
command
of
a
coquereau
a
a
moulin
a
focart
a
bouju
a
chouppes
my
dear
chevalier
the
opposite
party
is
quite
as
indignant
we
are
crowded
with
plebeians
they
have
an
excess
of
nobles
do
you
think
the
like
to
be
commanded
by
the
count
de
canclaux
the
viscount
de
miranda
the
viscount
de
beauharnais
the
count
de
valence
the
marquis
de
custine
and
the
duke
de
biron
what
a
combination
and
the
duke
de
chartres
son
of
égalité
by
the
way
when
will
he
be
king
never
he
aspires
to
the
throne
and
his
very
crimes
serve
to
promote
his
interests
and
his
vices
will
injure
his
cause
said
boisberthelot
then
after
another
pause
he
continued
nevertheless
he
was
anxious
to
be
reconciled
he
came
to
see
the
king
i
was
at
versailles
when
some
one
spit
on
his
back
from
the
top
of
the
grand
staircase
yes
i
am
glad
of
it
we
called
him
bourbon
le
bourbeux
he
is
he
has
pimples
he
is
a
regicide
poh
and
la
vieuville
added
i
was
with
him
at
ouessant
on
the
esprit
yes
had
he
obeyed
admiral
signal
to
keep
to
the
windward
he
would
have
prevented
the
english
from
passing
true
was
he
really
hidden
in
the
bottom
of
the
hold
no
but
we
must
say
so
all
the
same
and
la
vieuville
burst
out
laughing
boisberthelot
continued
fools
are
plentiful
look
here
i
have
known
this
boulainvilliers
of
whom
you
were
speaking
i
knew
him
well
at
first
the
peasants
were
armed
with
pikes
would
you
believe
it
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
form
them
into
he
wanted
to
drill
them
in
crossing
pikes
and
repelling
a
charge
he
dreamed
of
transforming
these
barbarians
into
regular
soldiers
he
undertook
to
teach
them
how
to
round
in
the
corners
of
their
squares
and
to
mass
battalions
with
hollow
squares
he
jabbered
the
antiquated
military
dialect
to
them
he
called
the
chief
of
a
squad
a
which
was
what
corporals
under
louis
xiv
were
called
he
persisted
in
forming
a
regiment
of
all
those
poachers
he
had
regular
companies
whose
sergeants
ranged
themselves
in
a
circle
every
evening
and
receiving
the
sign
and
countersign
from
the
colonel
sergeant
repeated
it
in
a
whisper
to
the
lieutenant
sergeant
who
repeated
it
to
his
next
neighbor
who
in
his
turn
transmitted
it
to
the
next
man
and
so
on
from
ear
to
ear
until
it
reached
the
last
man
he
cashiered
an
officer
for
not
standing
bareheaded
to
receive
the
watchword
from
the
sergeant
you
may
imagine
how
he
succeeded
this
simpleton
could
not
understand
that
peasants
have
to
be
led
peasant
fashion
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
transform
rustics
into
soldiers
yes
i
have
known
boulainvilliers
they
walked
along
a
few
steps
each
one
engrossed
in
his
own
thoughts
then
the
conversation
was
resumed
by
the
way
has
the
report
of
dampierre
death
been
confirmed
yes
commander
before
condé
at
the
camp
of
pamars
he
was
hit
by
a
boisberthelot
sighed
count
dampierre
another
of
our
men
who
took
sides
with
them
may
he
prosper
wherever
he
may
be
said
vieuville
and
the
ladies
where
are
they
at
trieste
still
there
yes
ah
this
republic
exclaimed
la
vieuville
what
havoc
from
so
slight
a
cause
to
think
that
this
revolution
was
the
result
of
a
deficit
of
only
a
few
millions
insignificant
beginnings
are
not
always
to
be
trusted
everything
goes
wrong
replied
la
vieuville
yes
la
rouarie
is
dead
du
dresnay
is
an
idiot
what
wretched
leaders
are
all
those
bishops
this
coucy
bishop
of
la
rochelle
beaupoil
bishop
of
poitiers
mercy
bishop
of
luzon
a
lover
of
madame
de
whose
name
is
servanteau
you
know
commander
eschasserie
is
the
name
of
an
estate
and
that
false
bishop
of
agra
who
is
a
curé
of
i
know
not
what
of
dol
his
name
is
guillot
de
folleville
but
then
he
is
brave
and
knows
how
to
fight
priests
when
one
needs
soldiers
bishops
who
are
no
bishops
at
all
generals
who
are
no
generals
la
vieuville
interrupted
boisberthelot
have
you
the
in
your
commander
yes
what
are
they
giving
now
in
paris
and
pauline
and
caverne
i
should
like
to
see
that
you
may
we
shall
be
in
paris
in
a
month
boisberthelot
thought
a
moment
and
then
added
at
the
latest
so
windham
told
lord
hood
then
commander
i
take
it
affairs
are
not
going
so
very
badly
all
would
go
well
provided
that
the
breton
war
were
well
managed
de
vieuville
shook
his
head
commander
he
said
are
we
to
land
the
marines
certainly
if
the
coast
is
friendly
but
not
otherwise
in
some
cases
war
must
force
the
gates
in
others
it
can
slip
through
them
civil
war
must
always
keep
a
false
key
in
its
pocket
we
will
do
all
we
can
but
one
must
have
a
chief
and
boisberthelot
added
thoughtfully
what
do
you
think
of
the
chevalier
de
dieuzie
la
vieuville
do
you
mean
the
younger
yes
for
a
commander
yes
he
is
only
good
for
a
pitched
battle
in
the
open
field
it
is
only
the
peasant
who
knows
the
underbrush
in
that
case
you
may
as
well
resign
yourself
to
generals
stofflet
and
cathelineau
la
vieuville
meditated
for
a
moment
then
he
said
what
we
need
is
a
prince
a
french
prince
a
prince
of
the
blood
a
real
prince
how
can
that
be
he
who
says
says
i
know
it
commander
but
we
need
him
for
the
impression
he
would
produce
upon
the
herd
my
dear
chevalier
the
princes
do
care
to
come
we
will
do
without
them
boisberthelot
pressed
his
hand
mechanically
against
his
forehead
as
if
striving
to
evoke
an
idea
he
resumed
then
let
us
try
this
general
he
is
a
great
nobleman
do
you
think
he
will
do
if
he
is
one
of
the
right
sort
said
la
vieuville
you
mean
relentless
said
boisberthelot
the
count
and
the
chevalier
looked
at
each
other
monsieur
boisberthelot
you
have
defined
the
meaning
of
the
word
relentless
yes
that
what
we
need
this
is
a
war
that
shows
no
mercy
the
bloodthirsty
are
in
the
ascendant
the
regicides
have
beheaded
louis
xvi
we
will
quarter
the
regicides
yes
the
general
we
need
is
general
relentless
in
anjou
and
upper
poitou
the
leaders
play
the
magnanimous
they
trifle
with
generosity
and
they
are
always
defeated
in
the
marais
and
the
country
of
retz
where
the
leaders
are
ferocious
everything
goes
bravely
forward
it
is
because
charette
is
fierce
that
he
stands
his
ground
against
parrein
hyena
pitted
against
hyena
boisberthelot
had
no
time
to
answer
vieuville
words
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
a
desperate
cry
and
at
the
same
instant
they
heard
a
noise
unlike
all
other
sounds
this
cry
and
the
unusual
sounds
came
from
the
interior
of
the
vessel
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
rushed
to
the
but
were
unable
to
enter
all
the
gunners
came
running
up
beside
themselves
with
terror
a
frightful
thing
had
just
happened
iv
tormentum
belli
illustration
one
of
the
carronades
of
the
battery
a
pound
cannon
had
become
loose
this
is
perhaps
the
most
dreadful
thing
that
can
take
place
at
sea
nothing
more
terrible
can
happen
to
a
under
full
sail
a
cannon
that
breaks
loose
from
its
fastenings
is
suddenly
transformed
into
a
supernatural
beast
it
is
a
monster
developed

one
might

that
this

wreaking
its
vengeance
it
would
seem
as
though
the
evil
in
what
we
call
inanimate

had
found
vent
and
suddenly
burst
forth
it
has
the
air
of
having
lost
its

of
taking
a
mysterious
dull
revenge
nothing
is
so
inexorable
as
the
rage
of

leaps
like

what

with
this
enormous

how

you
can
reason
with

take

there
is
no

with
the
monster
known
as
a

you
can
not

it
it
is
already
dead

it

it
breathes
a
sinister
life
bestowed
on
it
by
the
infinite

how
can

guard
against
these
terrible
gyrations
one
has
to
do
with
a
projectile
that
reflects
that
has
ideas
and
changes
its

at
any

how

illustration
the
extreme
danger
of
the
situation
comes
from
the
unsteadiness
of
the
deck
how
is
one
to
cope
with
the
caprices
of
an
inclined
plane
the
ship
had
within
its
depths
so
to
speak
imprisoned
lightning
struggling
for
escape
something
like
the
rumbling
of
thunder
during
an
earthquake
in
an
instant
the
crew
was
on
its
feet
it
was
the
chief
gunner
fault
who
had
neglected
to
fasten
the
of
the
breeching
chain
and
had
not
thoroughly
chocked
the
four
trucks
of
the
carronade
which
allowed
play
to
the
frame
and
bottom
of
the
thereby
disarranging
the
two
platforms
and
parting
the
breeching
the
lashings
were
broken
so
that
the
gun
was
no
longer
firm
on
its
carriage
the
stationary
breeching
which
prevents
the
recoil
was
not
in
use
at
that
time
as
a
wave
struck
the
ship
side
the
cannon
insufficiently
secured
had
receded
and
having
broken
its
chain
began
to
wander
threatningly
over
the
deck
in
order
to
get
an
idea
of
this
strange
sliding
fancy
a
drop
of
water
sliding
down
a
pane
of
glass
when
the
fastening
broke
the
gunners
were
in
the
battery
singly
and
in
groups
clearing
the
ship
for
action
the
carronade
thrown
forward
by
the
pitching
dashed
into
a
group
of
men
killing
four
of
them
at
the
first
blow

hurled
back
by

cut
in
two
an
unfortunate
fifth
man
and
struck
and
dismounted
one
of
the
guns
of
the

hence
the
cry
of
distress
which
had
been
heard
all
the
men
rushed
to
the
ladder
the
was
empty
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
monstrous
gun
was
left
to
itself
it
was
its
own
mistress
and
mistress
of
the
ship
it
could
do
with
it
whatsoever
it
wished
this
crew
accustomed
to
laugh
in
battle
now
trembled

would
be
impossible
to
describe
their
terror

brave
men
though
they
were
paused
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
silent
pale
and
undecided
looking
down
on
the
deck
some
one
pushed
them
aside
with
his
elbow
and
descended
it
was
their
passenger
the
peasant
the
man
about
whom
they
were
talking
a
moment
ago
having
reached
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
he
halted

illustration
the
cannon
was
rolling
to
and
fro
on
the
deck
it
might
have
been
called
the
living
chariot
of
the
apocalypse
a
dim
wavering
of
lights
and
shadows
was
added
to
this
spectacle
by
the
marine
lantern
swinging
under
the
deck
the
outlines
of
the
cannon
were
indistinguishable
by
reason
of
the
rapidity
of
its
motion
sometimes
it
looked
black
when
the
light
shone
upon
it
then
again
it
would
cast
pale
glimmering
reflections
in
the
darkness
it
was
still
pursuing
its
work
of
destruction
it
had
already
shattered
four
other
pieces
and
made
two
breaches
in
the
ship
side
fortunately
above
the
but
which
would
leak
in
case
of
rough
weather
it
rushed
frantically
against
the
timbers
the
stout
riders
resisted
curved
timbers
have
great
strength
but
one
could
hear
them
crack
under
this
tremendous
assault
brought
to
bear
simultaneously
on
every
side
with
a
certain
omnipresence
truly
appalling
a
bullet
shaken
in
a
bottle
could
not
produce
sharper
or
more
rapid
sounds
the
four
wheels
were
passing
and
repassing
over
the
dead
bodies
cutting
and
tearing
them
to
pieces
and
the
five
corpses
had
become
five
trunks
rolling
hither
and
thither
the
heads
seemed
to
cry
out
streams
of
blood
flowed
over
the
deck
following
the
motion
of
the
ship
the
ceiling
damaged
in
several
places
had
begun
to
give
way
the
whole
ship
was
filled
with
a
dreadful
tumult
the
captain
who
had
rapidly
recovered
his
had
given
orders
to
throw
down
the
hatchway
all
that
could
abate
the
rage
and
check
the
mad
onslaught
of
this
infuriated
gun
mattresses
hammocks
spare
sails
coils
of
rope
the
bags
of
the
crew
and
bales
of
false
assignats
with
which
the
corvette
was
laden
that
infamous
stratagem
of
english
origin
being
considered
a
fair
trick
in
war
but
what
availed
these
rags
no
one
dared
to
go
down
to
arrange
them
and
in
a
few
moments
they
were
reduced
to
lint
there
was
just
sea
enough
to
render
this
accident
as
complete
as
possible
a
tempest
would
have
been
welcome
it
might
have
upset
the
cannon
and
with
its
four
wheels
once
in
the
air
it
could
easily
have
been
mastered
meanwhile
the
havoc
increased
there
were
even
incisions
and
fractures
in
the
masts
that
stood
like
pillars
grounded
firmly
in
the
keel
and
piercing
the
several
decks
of
the
vessel
the
was
split
and
even
the
was
damaged
by
the
convulsive
blows
of
the
cannon
the
destruction
of
the
battery
still
went
on
ten
out
of
the
thirty
pieces
were
useless
the
fractures
in
the
side
increased
and
the
corvette
began
to
leak
the
old
passenger
who
had
descended
to
the
looked
like
one
carved
in
stone
as
he
stood
motionless
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
glanced
sternly
over
the
devastation
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
move
a
step
upon
the
deck
each
bound
of
the
liberated
carronade
seemed
to
threaten
the
destruction
of
the
ship
but
a
few
moments
longer
and
shipwreck
would
be
inevitable
they
must
either
overcome
this
calamity
or
perish
some
decisive
action
must
be
taken
but
what
what
a
combatant
was
this
carronade
here
was
this
mad
creature
to
be
arrested
this
flash
of
lightning
to
be
seized
this
thunderbolt
to
be
crushed

yes

replied
la

in
a

yes
and
in
moments
like
these
truly
god
alone
can
save
us
said
boisberthelot
all
were
silent
leaving
the
carronade
to
its
horrible
uproar
the
waves
beating
the
ship
from
without
answered
the
blows
of
the
cannon
within
very
much
like
a
couple
of
hammers
striking
in
turn
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
this
inaccessible
circus
where
the
escaped
cannon
was
tossing
from
side
to
side
a
man
appeared
grasping
an
iron
bar
it
was
the
author
of
the
catastrophe
the
chief
gunner
whose
criminal
negligence
had
caused
the
accident
the
captain
of
the
gun
having
brought
about
the
evil
his
intention
was
to
repair
it
holding
a
handspike
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
tiller
rope
with
the
in
it
he
had
jumped
through
the
hatchway
to
the
deck
below
then
began
a
terrible
struggle
a
titanic
spectacle
a
combat
between
cannon
and
cannoneer
a
contest
between
mind
and
matter
a
duel
between
man
and
the
inanimate
the
man
stood
in
one
corner
in
an
attitude
of
expectancy
leaning
on
the
rider
and
holding
in
his
hands
the
bar
and
the
rope
calm
livid
and
tragic
he
stood
firmly
on
his
legs
that
were
like
two
pillars
of
steel
he
was
waiting
for
the
cannon
to
approach
him
the
gunner
knew
his
piece
and
he
felt
as
though
it
must
know
him
they
had
lived
together
a
long
time
how
often
had
he
put
his
hand
in
its
mouth
it
was
his
domestic
monster
he
began
to
talk
to
it
as
he
would
to
a
dog
come
said
he
possibly
he
loved
it
he
seemed
to
wish
for
its
coming
and
yet
its
approach
meant
sure
destruction
for
him
how
to
avoid
being
crushed
was
the
question
all
looked
on
in
terror
not
a
breath
was
drawn
freely
except
perhaps
by
the
old
man
who
remained
on
the
gazing
sternly
on
the
two
combatants
he
himself
was
in
danger
of
being
crushed
by
the
piece
still
he
did
not
move
beneath
them
the
blind
sea
had
command
of
the
battle
when
in
the
act
of
accepting
this
awful
struggle
the
gunner
approached
to
challenge
the
cannon
it
happened
that
the
surging
sea
held
the
gun
motionless
for
an
instant
as
though
stupefied
come
on
said
the
man
it
seemed
to
listen
suddenly
it
leaped
towards
him
the
man
dodged
then
the
struggle
began
a
contest
unheard
of
the
fragile
wrestling
with
the
invulnerable
the
human
warrior
attacking
the
brazen
beast
blind
force
on
the
one
side
soul
on
the
other
all
this
was
in
the
shadow
it
was
like
an
indistinct
vision
of
a
miracle
a
soul
strangely
enough
it
seemed
as
if
a
soul
existed
within
the
cannon
but
one
consumed
with
hate
and
rage
the
blind
thing
seemed
to
have
eyes
it
appeared
as
though
the
monster
were
watching
the
man
there
was
or
at
least
one
might
have
supposed
it
cunning
in
this
mass
it
also
chose
its
opportunity
it
was
as
though
a
gigantic
insect
of
iron
was
endowed
with
the
will
of
a
demon
now
and
then
this
colossal
grasshopper
would
strike
the
low
ceiling
of
the
then
falling
back
on
its
four
wheels
like
a
tiger
on
all
fours
rush
upon
the
man
he
supple
agile
adroit
writhed
like
a
serpent
before
these
lightning
movements
he
avoided
encounters
but
the
blows
from
which
he
escaped
fell
with
destructive
force
upon
the
vessel
a
piece
of
broken
chain
remained
attached
to
the
carronade
this
bit
of
chain
had
twisted
in
some
incomprehensible
way
around
the
one
end
of
the
chain
was
fastened
to
the
the
other
end
thrashed
wildly
around
aggravating
the
danger
with
every
bound
of
the
cannon
the
screw
held
it
as
in
a
clenched
hand
and
this
chain
multiplying
the
strokes
of
the
by
those
of
the
thong
made
a
terrible
whirlwind
around
the
gun
a
lash
of
iron
in
a
fist
of
brass
this
chain
complicated
the
combat
despite
all
this
the
man
fought
he
even
attacked
the
cannon
at
times
crawling
along
by
the
side
of
the
ship
and
clutching
his
handspike
and
the
rope
the
cannon
seemed
to
understand
his
movements
and
fled
as
though
suspecting
a
trap
the
man
nothing
daunted
pursued
his
chase
such
a
struggle
must
necessarily
be
brief
suddenly
the
cannon
seemed
to
say
to
itself
now
then
there
must
be
an
end
to
this
and
it
stopped
a
crisis
was
felt
to
be
at
hand
the
cannon
as
if
in
suspense
seemed
to
meditate
or
for
to
all
intents
and
purposes
it
was
a
living
creature
it
really
did
meditate
some
furious
design
all
at
once
it
rushed
on
the
gunner
who
sprang
aside
with
a
laugh
crying
out
try
it
again
as
the
cannon
passed
him
the
gun
in
its
fury
smashed
one
of
the
larboard
carronades
then
by
the
invisible
sling
in
which
it
seemed
to
be
held
it
was
thrown
to
the
starboard
towards
the
man
who
escaped
three
carronades
were
crushed
by
its
onslaught
then
as
though
blind
and
beside
itself
it
turned
from
the
man
and
rolled
from
stern
to
stem
splintering
the
latter
and
causing
a
breach
in
the
walls
of
the
prow
the
gunner
took
refuge
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
a
short
distance
from
the
old
man
who
stood
watching
he
held
his
handspike
in
readiness
the
cannon
seemed
aware
of
it
and
without
taking
the
trouble
to
turn
it
rushed
backward
on
the
man
as
swift
as
the
blow
of
an
axe
the
gunner
if
driven
up
against
the
side
of
the
ship
would
be
lost
one
cry
arose
from
the
crew
the
old
passenger
who
until
this
moment
had
stood
motionless
sprang
forward
more
swiftly
than
all
those
mad
whirls
he
had
seized
a
bale
of
the
false
assignats
and
at
the
risk
of
being
crushed
succeeded
in
throwing
it
between
the
wheels
of
the
carronade
this
decisive
and
perilous
manoeuvre
could
not
have
been
executed
with
more
precision
and
adroitness
by
an
adept
in
all
the
exercises
given
in
the
work
of
durosel
manual
of
naval
gunnery
the
bale
had
the
effect
of
a
plug
a
pebble
may
block
a
log
a
branch
sometimes
changes
the
course
of
an
avalanche
the
carronade
stumbled
and
the
gunner
availing
himself
of
the
perilous
opportunity
thrust
his
iron
bar
between
the
spokes
of
the
back
wheels
pitching
forward
the
cannon
stopped
and
the
man
using
his
bar
for
a
lever
rocked
it
backward
and
forward
the
heavy
mass
upset
with
the
resonant
sound
of
a
bell
that
crashes
in
its
fall
the
man
reeking
with
perspiration
threw
himself
upon
it
and
passed
the
of
the
around
the
neck
of
the
defeated
monster
the
combat
was
ended
the
man
had
conquered
the
ant
had
overcome
the
mastodon
the
pygmy
had
imprisoned
the
thunderbolt
the
soldiers
and
sailors
applauded
the
crew
rushed
forward
with
chains
and
cables
and
in
an
instant
the
cannon
was
secured
saluting
the
passenger
the
gunner
exclaimed
sir
you
have
saved
my
life
the
old
man
had
resumed
his
impassible
attitude
and
made
no
reply
vi
the
two
ends
of
the
scale
the
man
had
conquered
but
it
might
be
affirmed
that
the
cannon
also
had
gained
a
victory
immediate
shipwreck
was
averted
but
the
corvette
was
still
in
danger
the
injuries
the
ship
had
sustained
seemed
irreparable
there
were
five
breaches
in
the
sides
one
of
them
a
very
large
one
in
the
bow
and
twenty
carronades
out
of
thirty
lay
shattered
in
their
frames
the
recaptured
gun
which
had
been
secured
by
a
chain
was

disabled
the
screw
of
the
being
wrenched
it
would
consequently
be
impossible
to
level
the
cannon
the
battery
was
reduced
to
nine
guns
there
was
a
leakage
in
the
hold
all
these
damages
must
be
repaired
without
loss
of
time
and
the
pumps
set
in
operation
now
that
the

become
visible
it
was
frightful
to
look
upon
the
interior
of
a
mad
elephant
cage
could
not
have
been
more
thoroughly
devastated
however
important
it
might
be
for
the
corvette
to
avoid
observation
the
care
for
its
immediate
safety
was
still
more
imperative
they
were
obliged
to
light
the
deck
with
lanterns
placed
at
intervals
along
the
sides
in
the
mean
time
while
this
tragic
entertainment
had
lasted
the
crew
entirely
absorbed
by
a
question
of
life
and
death
had
not
noticed
what
was
going
on
outside
of
the
ship
the
fog
had
thickened
the
weather
had
changed
the
wind
had
driven
the
vessel
at
will
they
were
out
of
their
course
in
full
sight
of
jersey
and
guernsey
much
farther
to
the
south
than
they
ought
to
have
been
and
confronting
a
tumultuous
sea
the
big
waves
kissed
the
wounded
sides
of
the
corvette
with
kisses
that
savored
of
danger
the
heaving
of
the
sea
grew
threatening
the
wind
had
risen
to
a
gale
a
squall
perhaps
a
tempest
was
brewing
one
could
not
see
four
oars
length
before
one
while
the
crew
made
haste
with
their
temporary
repairs
on
the
stopping
the
leaks
and
setting
up
the
cannons
that
had
escaped
uninjured
the
old
passenger
returned
to
the
deck
he
stood
leaning
against
the
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
ship
the
chevalier
de
la
vieuville
had
drawn
up
the
marines
on
either
side
of
the
and
at
a
of
the
boatswain
the
sailors
who
had
been
busy
in
the
rigging
stood
up
on
the
yards
count
boisberthelot
approached
the
passenger
the
captain
was
followed
by
a
man
who
haggard
and
panting
with
his
dress
in
disorder
still
wore
on
his
countenance
an
expression
of
content
it
was
the
gunner
who
had
so
opportunely
displayed
his
power
as
a
tamer
of
monsters
and
gained
the
victory
over
the
cannon
the
count
made
a
military
salute
to
the
old
man
in
the
peasant
garb
and
said
to
him
here
is
the
man
general
the
gunner
with
downcast
eyes
stood
erect
in
a
military
attitude
general
resumed
count
boisberthelot
considering
what
this
man
has
done
do
you
not
think
that
his
superiors
have
a
duty
to
perform
i
think
so
replied
the
old
man
be
so
good
as
to
give
your
orders
resumed
boisberthelot
it
is
for
you
to
give
them
you
are
the
captain
but
you
are
the
general
answered
boisberthelot
the
old
man
looked
at
the
gunner
step
forward
he
said
the
gunner
advanced
a
step
turning
to
count
boisberthelot
the
old
man
removed
the
cross
of
saint
louis
from
the
captain
breast
and
fastened
it
on
the
jacket
of
the
gunner
the
sailors
cheered
and
the
marines
presented
arms
then
pointing
to
the
bewildered
gunner
he
added
now
let
the
man
be
shot
stupor
took
the
place
of
applause
then
amid
a
silence
the
old
man
raising
his
voice
said
illustration
the
ship
has
been
endangered
by
an
act
of
carelessness
and
may
even
yet
be
lost
it
is
all
the
same
whether
one
be
at
sea
or
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
a
ship
at
sea
is
like
an
army
in
battle
the
tempest
though
unseen
is
ever
present
the
sea
is
an
ambush
death
is
the
fit
penalty
for
every
fault
committed
when
facing
the
enemy
there
is
no
fault
that
can
be
retrieved
courage
must
be
rewarded
and
negligence
punished
these
words
fell
one
after
the
other
slowly
and
gravely
with
a
certain
implacable
rhythm
like
the
strokes
of
the
axe
upon
an
looking
at
the
soldiers
the
old
man
added
do
your
duty
the
man
on
whose
breast
shone
the
cross
of
saint
louis
bowed
his
head
and
at
a
sign
of
count
boisberthelot
two
sailors
went
down
to
the
and
presently
returned
bringing
the
the
two
sailors
were
accompanied
by
the
ship
chaplain
who
since
the
departure
had
been
engaged
in
saying
prayers
in
the
officers
quarters
a
sergeant
detached
from
the
ranks
twelve
soldiers
whom
he
arranged
in
two
rows
six
men
in
a
row
the
gunner
placed
himself
between
the
two
lines
the
chaplain
holding
a
crucifix
advanced
and
took
his
place
beside
the
man
march
came
from
the
lips
of
the
sergeant
and
the
platoon
slowly
moved
towards
the
bow
followed
by
two
sailors
canning
the
shroud
a
gloomy
silence
fell
on
the
corvette
in
the
distance
a
hurricane
was
blowing
a
few
moments
later
a
report
echoed
through
the
gloom
one
flash
and
all
was
still
then
came
the
splash
of
a
body
falling
into
the
water
the
old
passenger
still
leaning
against
the
his
hands
crossed
on
his
breast
seemed
lost
in
thought
boisberthelot
pointing
towards
him
with
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
remarked
in
an
undertone
to
la
vieuville
the
vendée
has
found
a
leader
vii
he
who
sets
sail
invests
in
a
lottery
but
what
was
to
become
of
the
corvette
the
clouds
that
had
mingled
all
night
with
the
waves
had
now
fallen
so
low
that
they
overspread
the
sea
like
a
mantle
and
completely
shut
out
the
horizon
nothing
but
fog
always
a
dangerous
situation
even
for
a
seaworthy
vessel
a
heavy
swell
was
added
to
the
mist
they
had
improved
their
time
the
corvette
had
been
lightened
by
throwing
into
the
sea
everything
that
they
had
been
able
to
clear
away
after
the
havoc
caused
by
the
carronade
dismantled
cannons
twisted
or
loosened
timbers
splintered
pieces
of
wood
and
iron
the
were
opened
and
the
corpses
and
parts
of
human
bodies
wrapped
in
tarpaulin
were
slid
down
on
planks
into
the
sea
the
sea
was
running
high
not
that
the
tempest
was
imminent
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
as
if
the
hurricane
that
was
rumbling
afar
off
on
the
horizon
and
the
wind
were
both
decreasing
and
moving
northward
but
the
waves
were
still
high
showing
an
angry
sea
and
the
corvette
in
its
disabled
condition
could
with
difficulty
resist
the
shocks
so
that
the
high
waves
might
prove
fatal
to
it
gacquoil
absorbed
in
thought
remained
at
the
helm
to
show
a
bold
front
in
the
presence
of
danger
is
the
habit
of
commanders
la
vieuville
whose
spirits
rose
in
time
of
trouble
addressed
gacquoil
well
pilot
he
said
the
squall
has
subsided
its
came
to
naught
we
shall
pull
through
we
shall
get
some
wind
and
nothing
more
we
ca
have
wind
without
waves
a
true
sailor
neither
gay
nor
sad
and
his
reply
was
charged
with
an
anxious
significance
for
a
leaking
ship
a
high
sea
means
a
rapid
sinking
gacquoil
had
emphasized
this
prediction
by
frowning
perhaps
he
thought
that
after
the
catastrophe
with
the
cannon
and
the
gunner
la
vieuville
had
been
too
quick
to
use
almost
cheerful
words
certain
things
bring
at
sea
the
sea
is
reticent
one
never
knows
its
intentions
and
it
is
well
to
be
on
one
guard
la
vieuville
felt
obliged
to
resume
his
gravity
where
are
we
pilot
he
asked
in
the
hands
of
god
replied
the
pilot
a
pilot
is
a
master
he
must
always
be
allowed
to
do
what
pleases
him
and
often
to
say
what
he
chooses
that
kind
of
man
is
not
apt
to
be
loquacious
la
vieuville
left
him
after
asking
a
question
to
which
the
horizon
soon
replied
the
sea
had
suddenly
cleared
the
trailing
fogs
were
rent
the
dusky
heaving
waves
stretched
as
far
as
the
eye
could
penetrate
into
the
dim
twilight
and
this
was
the
sight
that
lay
before
them
the
sky
was
shut
in
by
clouds
although
they
no
longer
touched
the
water
the
dawn
had
begun
to
illumine
the
east
while
in
the
west
the
setting
moon
still
cast
a
pale
glimmering
light
these
two
pallid
presences
in
opposite
quarters
of
the
sky
outlined
the
horizon
in
two
narrow
bands
of
light
between
the
dark
sea
and
the
gloomy
sky
black
silhouettes
were
sketched
against
them
upright
and
motionless
in
the
west
against
the
moonlit
sky
three
high
cliffs
stood
forth
like
celtic
cromlechs
in
the
east
against
the
pale
horizon
of
the
morning
eight
sails
drawn
up
in
a
row
in
formidable
array
came
in
view
the
three
cliffs
were
a
reef
the
eight
sails
a
squadron
behind
them
was
minquiers
a
cliff
of
and
in
front
were
the
french
cruisers
with
an
abyss
on
the
left
hand
and
carnage
on
the
right
they
had
to
choose
between
shipwreck
and
a
battle
the
corvette
must
either
encounter
the
cliffs
with
a
damaged
hull
a
shattered
rigging
and
broken
masts
or
face
a
battle
knowing
that
twenty
out
of
the
thirty
cannons
of
which
her
artillery
consisted
were
disabled
and
the
best
of
her
gunners
dead
the
dawn
was
still
feint
and
the
night
not
yet
ended
this
darkness
might
possibly
last
for
quite
a
long
time
as
it
was
caused
mostly
by
the
clouds
that
hung
high
in
the
air
thick
and
dense
looking
like
a
solid
vault
the
wind
had
scattered
the
driving
the
corvette
on
minquiers
in
her
extreme
weakness
and
dilapidated
as
she
was
she
hardly
obeyed
the
helm
as
she
rolled
helplessly
along
lashed
onward
by
the
force
of
the
waves
the
minquiers
that
tragic
reef
was
more
dangerous
at
that
time
than
it
is
now
several
of
the
turrets
of
this
marine
fortress
have
been
worn
away
by
the
incessant
action
of
the
sea
the
form
of
reefs
changes
waves
are
fitly
likened
unto
swords
each
tide
is
like
the
stroke
of
a
saw
at
that
time
to
be
stranded
on
the
minquiers
meant
certain
death
the
cruisers
composed
the
squadron
of
cancale
the
one
that
afterwards
became
so
famous
under
the
command
of
captain
duchesne
called
by
lequinio
père
duchesne
the
situation
was
critical
during
the
struggle
with
the
carronade
the
ship
had
wandered
unconsciously
from
her
course
sailing
more
in
the
direction
of
granville
than
of
malo
even
had
her
sailing
power
been
unimpaired
the
minquiers
would
have
barred
her
return
to
jersey
while
the
cruisers
hindered
her
passage
towards
france
although
there
was
no
storm
yet
as
the
pilot
had
said
the
sea
was
rough
rolled
by
the
heavy
wind
over
a
rocky
bottom
it
had
grown
savage
the
sea
never
tells
what
it
wants
at
the
first
onset
everything
lies
concealed
in
its
abyss
even
trickery
one
might
almost
affirm
that
it
has
a
scheme
it
advances
and
recedes
it
offers
and
refuses
it
arranges
for
a
storm
and
suddenly
gives
up
its
intention
it
promises
an
abyss
and
fails
to
keep
its
agreement
it
threatens
the
north
and
strikes
the
south
all
night
long
the
corvette
claymore
labored
with
the
fog
and
feared
the
storm
the
sea
had
disappointed
them
in
a
savage
sort
of
way
it
had
drawn
a
storm
in
outline
and
filled
in
the
picture
with
a
reef
illustration
it
was
to
be
a
shipwreck
in
any
event
but
it
had
assumed
another
form
and
with
one
enemy
to
supplement
the
work
of
the
other
it
was
to
combine
a
wreck
on
the
surf
with
destruction
by
battle
a
shipwreck
on
the
one
hand
and
a
fight
on
the
other
exclaimed
vieuville
amid
his
gallant
laughter
we
have
thrown
double
fives
on
both
sides
viii
illustration
the
corvette
was
little
better
than
a
wreck
a
sepulchral
solemnity
pervaded
the
dim
twilight
the
darkness
of
the
clouds
the
confused
changes
of
the
horizon
and
the
mysterious
sullenness
of
the
waves
there
was
no
sound
except
the
hostile
blasts
of
the
wind
the
catastrophe
rose
majestic
from
the
abyss
it
looked
more
like
an
apparition
than
an
attack
no
stir
on
the
rocks
no
stir
on
the
ships
the
silence
was
overpowering
beyond
description
were
they
dealing
with
reality
it
was
like
a
dream
passing
over
the
sea
there
are
legends
that
tell
of
such
visions
the
corvette
lay
so
to
speak
between
a
demon
reef
and
a
phantom
fleet
count
boisberthelot
in
a
low
voice
gave
orders
to
la
vieuville
who
went
down
to
the
while
the
captain
seizing
his
telescope
stationed
himself
behind
the
pilot
gacquoil
sole
effort
was
to
keep
up
the
corvette
to
the
wind
for
if
struck
on
her
side
by
the
sea
and
the
wind
she
would
inevitably
capsize
pilot
where
are
we
said
the
captain
on
the
minquiers
on
which
side
on
the
worst
one
what
kind
of
bottom
small
rocks
can
we
turn
broadside
on
we
can
always
die
the
captain
turned
his
towards
the
west
and
examined
the
minquiers
then
turning
it
to
the
east
he
watched
the
sails
that
were
in
sight
the
pilot
went
on
as
though
speaking
to
himself
yonder
is
the
minquiers
that
is
where
the
laughing
and
the
great
gull
stop
to
rest
when
they
migrate
from
holland
meanwhile
the
captain
had
counted
the
sails
there
were
indeed
eight
ships
drawn
up
in
line
their
warlike
profiles
rising
above
the
water
in
the
centre
was
seen
the
stately
outline
of
a
the
captain
questioned
the
pilot
do
you
know
those
ships
of
course
i
do
what
are
they
that
the
squadron
of
the
french
of
the
devil
a
silence
ensued
and
again
the
captain
resumed
his
questions
are
all
the
cruisers
there
no
not
all
in
fact
on
the
of
april
valazé
had
reported
to
the
convention
that
ten
frigates
and
six
ships
of
the
line
were
cruising
in
the
channel
the
captain
remembered
this
you
are
right
he
said
the
squadron
numbers
sixteen
ships
and
only
eight
are
here
the
others
are
straggling
along
the
coast
down
below
on
the
lookout
said
gacquoil
still
gazing
through
his
the
captain
murmured
one
two
and
five
frigates
i
too
have
seen
them
close
at
hand
muttered
gacquoil
i
know
them
too
well
to
mistake
one
for
the
other
the
captain
passed
his
glass
to
the
pilot
pilot
can
you
make
out
distinctly
the
largest
ship
yes
commander
it
is
the
they
have
given
it
a
new
name
it
used
to
be
the
de
bourgogne
a
new
ship
of
a
hundred
and
cannon
he
took
a
and
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
wrote
down
the
number
pilot
what
is
the
first
ship
on
the
port
the
a
frigate
of
the
first
class
guns
she
was
fitting
out
at
brest
two
months
ago
the
captain
put
down
on
his
the
number
what
is
the
second
ship
to
port
pilot
the
a
frigate
of
the
first
class
forty
she
has
been
in
india
and
has
a
glorious
military
record
and
below
the
he
wrote
the
number
then
raising
his
head
he
said
now
on
the
starboard
they
are
all
frigates
commander
there
are
five
of
them
which
is
the
first
one
from
the
ship
the
the
second
the
same
next
the
a
queer
name
to
sail
under
next
the
next
the
five
frigates
each
of
guns
the
captain
wrote
under
the
first
numbers
you
are
sure
you
recognize
them
pilot
he
asked
you
also
know
them
well
commander
it
is
something
to
recognize
them
but
it
is
better
to
know
them
the
captain
with
his
eyes
on
the
was
adding
up
the
column
to
himself
one
hundred
and
forty
one
hundred
and
sixty
just
then
la
vieuville
came
up
on
deck
chevalier
exclaimed
the
captain
we
are
facing
three
hundred
and
eighty
cannon
so
be
it
replied
la
vieuville
you
have
just
been
making
an
inspection
la
vieuville
how
many
guns
have
we
fit
for
service
nine
so
be
it
responded
boisberthelot
in
his
turn
and
taking
the
telescope
from
the
pilot
he
scanned
the
horizon
the
eight
black
and
silent
ships
though
they
appeared
immovable
continued
to
increase
in
size
they
were
gradually
drawing
nearer
la
vieuville
saluted
the
captain
commander
he
said
here
is
my
report
i
mistrusted
this
corvette
it
is
never
pleasant
to
be
suddenly
ordered
on
board
a
ship
that
neither
knows
nor
loves
you
an
english
ship
is
a
traitor
to
the
french
that
slut
of
a
carronade
proved
this
i
have
made
the
inspection
the
anchors
are
good
they
are
not
made
of
inferior
iron
but
hammered
out
of
solid
bars
the
flukes
are
solid
the
cables
are
excellent
easy
to
pay
out
and
have
the
requisite
length
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
fathoms
plenty
of
ammunition
six
gunners
dead
each
gun
has
one
hundred
and
rounds
because
there
are
only
nine
cannon
left
grumbled
the
captain
boisberthelot
levelled
his
glass
to
the
horizon
the
squadron
continued
its
slow
approach
carronades
have
one
advantage
three
men
are
sufficient
to
man
them
but
they
also
have
a
disadvantage
they
do
not
carry
as
far
and
shoot
with
less
precision
than
cannon
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
let
the
squadron
approach
within
the
range
of
the
carronades
the
captain
gave
his
orders
in
a
low
voice
silence
reigned
on
the
ship
no
signal
to
clear
the
decks
for
action
had
been
given
but
still
it
had
been
done
the
corvette
was
as
helpless
to
cope
with
men
as
with
the
sea
they
did
their
best
with
this
remnant
of
a
near
the
on
the
gangway
were
piled
spare
hawsers
and
cables
to
strengthen
the
mast
in
case
of
need
the
quarters
for
the
wounded
were
put
in
order
according
to
the
naval
practice
of
those
days
they
barricaded
the
deck
which
is
a
protection
against
balls
but
not
against
bullets
the
were
brought
although
it
was
rather
late
to
ascertain
the
caliber
but
they
had
not
anticipated
so
many
incidents
were
distributed
among
the
sailors
and
each
one
secured
a
pair
of
pistols
and
a
dirk
in
his
belt
hammocks
were
stowed
away
guns
were
pointed
and
muskets
axes
and
grapplings
prepared
the
cartridge
and
bullet
stores
were
put
in
readiness
the
was
opened
every
man
stood
at
his
post
not
a
word
was
spoken
while
these
preparations
went
on
amid
haste
and
gloom
and
it
seemed
like
the
room
of
a
dying
person
then
the
corvette
was
turned
broadside
on
she
carried
six
anchors
like
a
frigate
and
all
of
them
were
cast
the
spare
anchor
forward
the
kedger
aft
the
towards
the
open
the
towards
the
breakers
the
to
starboard
and
the
to
port
the
nine
uninjured
carronades
were
placed
as
a
battery
on
the
side
towards
the
enemy
the
squadron
equally
silent
had
also
finished
its
evolutions
the
eight
ships
now
stood
in
a
semicircle
of
which
minquiers
formed
the
chord
the
claymore
enclosed
within
this
semicircle
and
held
furthermore
by
its
own
anchors
was
backed
by
the
reef
signifying
shipwreck
it
was
like
a
pack
of
hounds
surrounding
a
wild
boar
not
giving
tongue
but
showing
its
teeth
it
seemed
as
if
each
side
were
waiting
for
something
the
gunners
of
the
claymore
stood
to
their
guns
boisberthelot
said
to
la
vieuville
i
should
like
to
be
the
first
to
open
fire
a
coquette
fancy
replied
la
vieuville
ix
some
one
escapes
the
passenger
had
not
left
the
deck
he
watched
all
that
was
going
on
with
his
customary
impassibility
boisberthelot
went
up
to
him
sir
he
said
the
preparations
are
completed
we
are
now
clinging
to
our
grave
we
shall
not
relax
our
hold
we
must
succumb
either
to
the
squadron
or
to
the
reef
the
alternative
is
before
us
either
shipwreck
among
the
breakers
or
surrender
to
the
enemy
but
the
resource
of
death
is
still
left
better
to
fight
than
be
wrecked
i
would
rather
be
shot
than
drowned
fire
before
water
if
the
choice
be
left
to
me
but
where
it
is
our
duty
to
die
it
is
not
yours
you
are
the
man
chosen
by
princes
you
have
an
important
mission
that
of
directing
the
vendean
war
your
death
might
result
in
the
failure
of
monarchy
therefore
you
must
live
while
honor
requires
us
to
stand
by
the
ship
it
calls
on
you
to
escape
you
must
leave
us
general
i
will
provide
you
with
a
boat
and
a
man
you
may
succeed
in
reaching
the
shore
by
making
a
détour
it
is
not
yet
daylight
the
waves
are
high
and
the
sea
dark
you
will
probably
escape
there
are
occasions
when
to
flee
means
to
conquer
the
old
man
bent
his
stately
head
in
token
of
acquiescence
count
boisberthelot
raised
his
voice
soldiers
and
sailors
he
called
every
movement
ceased
and
from
all
sides
faces
were
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
captain
he
continued
this
man
who
is
among
us
represents
the
king
he
has
been
intrusted
to
our
care
we
must
save
him
he
is
needed
for
the
throne
of
france
as
we
have
no
prince
he
is
to
be
at
least
we
hope
so
the
leader
of
the
vendée
he
is
a
great
general
he
was
to
land
with
us
in
france
now
he
must
land
without
us
if
we
save
the
head
we
save
all
yes
yes
yes
cried
the
voices
of
all
the
crew
the
captain
went
on
he
too
is
about
to
face
a
serious
danger
it
is
not
easy
to
reach
the
coast
the
boat
must
be
large
enough
to
live
in
this
sea
and
small
enough
to
escape
the
cruisers
he
must
land
at
some
safe
point
and
it
will
be
better
to
do
so
nearer
fougères
than
coutances
we
want
a
hardy
sailor
a
good
and
a
strong
swimmer
a
man
from
that
neighborhood
and
one
who
knows
the
straits
it
is
still
so
dark
that
a
boat
can
put
off
from
the
corvette
without
attracting
attention
and
later
there
will
be
smoke
enough
to
hide
it
from
view
its
size
will
be
an
advantage
in
the
shallows
where
the
panther
is
caught
the
weasel
escapes
although
there
is
no
outlet
for
us
there
may
be
for
a
small
rowboat
the
enemy
ships
will
not
see
it
and
what
is
more
about
that
time
we
shall
be
giving
them
plenty
of
diversion
is
it
decided
yes
yes
yes
cried
the
crew
then
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
continued
the
captain
is
there
a
man
among
you
willing
to
undertake
the
business
in
the
darkness
a
sailor
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
and
said
i
am
the
man

does

escape
illustration
a
few
minutes
later
one
of
those
small
boats
called
a
gig
which
are
always
devoted
to
the
use
of
the
captain
pushed
off
from
the
ship
there
were
two
men
in
this
boat
the
passenger
in
the
stern
and
the
volunteer
sailor
in
the
bow
the
night
was
still
very
dark
the
sailor
according
to
the
captain
instructions
rowed
energetically
towards
the
minquiers
for
that
matter
it
was
the
only
direction
in
which
he
could
row
some
provisions
had
been
placed
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
a
bag
of
biscuits
a
smoked
tongue
and
a
barrel
of
water
just
as
they
were
lowering
the
gig
la
vieuville
a
very
scoffer
in
the
presence
of
destruction
leaning
over
the
of
the
corvette
cried
out
in
his
cool
sneering
voice
a
parting
word
very
good
for
escaping
and
still
better
for
drowning
sir
let
us
joke
no
more
said
the
pilot
they
pushed
off
rapidly
and
soon
left
the
corvette
far
behind
both
wind
and
tide
were
in
the
favor
and
the
small
skiff
flew
rapidly
along
wavering
to
and
fro
in
the
twilight
and
hidden
by
the
high
crests
of
the
waves
a
gloomy
sense
of
expectation
brooded
over
the
sea
suddenly
amid
this
illimitable
tumultuous
silence
a
voice
was
heard
exaggerated
by
the
as
by
the
brazen
mask
of
ancient
tragedy
it
seemed
almost
superhuman
it
was
captain
boisberthelot
speaking
royal
marines
he
exclaimed
nail
the
white
flag
to
the
we
are
about
to
look
upon
our
last
sunrise
and
the
corvette
fired
a
shot
long
live
the
king
shouted
the
crew
then
from
the
verge
of
the
horizon
was
heard
another
shout
stupendous
remote
confused
and
yet
distinct
long
live
the
republic
and
a
din
like
unto
the
roar
of
three
hundred
thunderbolts
exploded
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
the
conflict
began
the
sea
was
covered
with
fire
and
smoke
jets
of
spray
thrown
up
by
the
balls
as
they
struck
the
water
rose
from
the
sea
on
all
sides
the
claymore
was
pouring
forth
flame
on
the
eight
vessels
the
squadron
ranged
in
a
semicircle
around
her
opened
fire
from
all
its
batteries
the
horizon
was
in
a
blaze
a
volcano
seemed
to
have
sprung
from
the
sea
the
wind
swept
to
and
fro
this
stupendous
crimson
drapery
of
battle
through
which
the
vessels
appeared
and
disappeared
like
phantoms
against
the
red
sky
in
the
foreground
were
sketched
the
outlines
of
the
corvette
the
flag
could
be
seen
floating
from
the
the
two
men
in
the
boat
were
silent
the
triangular
shoal
of
the
minquiers
a
kind
of
submarine
trinacrium
is
larger
than
the
isle
of
jersey
the
sea
covers
it
its
culminating
point
is
a
plateau
that
is
never
submerged
even
at
the
highest
tide
and
from
which
rise
towards
the
northeast
six
mighty
rocks
standing
in
a
line
producing
the
effect
of
a
massive
wall
which
has
crumbled
here
and
there
the
strait
between
the
plateau
and
the
six
reefs
is
accessible
only
to
vessels
drawing
very
little
water
beyond
this
strait
is
the
open
sea
illustration
the
sailor
who
had
volunteered
to
manage
the
boat
headed
for
the
strait
thus
he
had
put
minquiers
between
the
boat
and
the
battle
he
navigated
skilfully
in
the
narrow
channel
avoiding
rocks
to
starboard
and
port
the
cliff
now
hid
the
battle
from
their
view
the
flaming
horizon
and
the
furious
din
of
the
cannonade
were
growing
less
distinct
by
reason
of
the
increased
distance
but
judging
from
the
continued
explosions
one
could
guess
that
the
corvette
still
held
its
own
and
that
it
meant
to
use
its
hundred
and
rounds
to
the
very
last
the
boat
soon
found
itself
in
smooth
waters
beyond
the
cliffs
and
the
battle
and
out
of
the
reach
of
missiles
gradually
the
surface
of
the
sea
lost
something
of
its
gloom
the
rays
of
light
that
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
shadows
began
to
widen
the
curling
foam
leaped
forth
in
jets
of
light
and
the
broken
waves
sent
back
their
pale
reflections
daylight
appeared
the
boat
was
beyond
reach
of
the
enemy
but
the
principal
difficulty
still
remained
to
be
overcome
it
was
safe
from
but
the
danger
of
shipwreck
was
not
yet
past
it
was
on
the
open
sea
a
mere
shell
with
neither
deck
sail
mast
nor
compass
entirely
dependent
on
its
oars
face
to
face
with
the
ocean
and
the
hurricane
a
pygmy
at
the
mercy
of
giants
then
amid
this
infinite
solitude
his
face
whitened
by
the
morning
light
the
man
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
raised
his
head
and
gazed
steadily
at
the
man
in
the
stern
as
he
said
i
am
the
brother
of
him
whom
you
ordered
to
be
shot

the
old
man
slowly
lifted
his
head
he
who
had
addressed
him
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
the
tan
of
the
sea
was
upon
his
brow
there
was
something
unusual
about
his
eyes
as
if
the
simple
pupils
of
the
peasant
had
taken
on
the
keen
expression
of
the
sailor
he
held
his
oars
firmly
in
his
hands
he
looked
gentle
enough
in
his
belt
he
wore
a
dirk
two
pistols
and
a
rosary
who
are
you
said
the
old
man
i
have
just
told
you
what
do
you
wish
the
man
dropped
the
oars
folded
his
arms
and
replied
to
kill
you
as
you
please
replied
the
old
man
the
man
raised
his
voice
prepare
yourself
for
what
to
die
why
inquired
the
old
man
a
silence
followed
for
a
moment
the
question
seemed
to
abash
the
man
he
continued
i
tell
you
that
i
mean
to
kill
you
and
i
ask
of
you
the
reason
the
sailor
eyes
flashed
because
you
killed
my
brother
the
old
man
answered
quietly
i
saved
his
life
at
first
true
you
saved
him
first
but
you
killed
him
afterwards
it
was
not
i
who
killed
him
who
was
it
then
his
own
fault
the
sailor
gazed
on
the
old
man
then
once
more
his
brows
contracted
savagely
what
is
your
name
asked
the
old
man
my
name
is
halmalo
but
i
can
kill
you
all
the
same
whether
you
know
my
name
or
not
just
then
the
sun
rose
a
ray
struck
the
sailor
full
in
the
face
vividly
illumining
that
wild
countenance
the
old
man
studied
it
closely
the
cannonading
though
not
yet
ended
was
no
longer
continuous
a
dense
smoke
had
settled
upon
the
horizon
the
boat
left
to
itself
was
drifting
to
leeward
with
his
right
hand
the
sailor
seized
one
of
the
pistols
at
his
belt
while
in
his
left
he
held
his
rosary
the
old
man
rose
to
his
feet
do
you
believe
in
god
he
asked
father
who
art
in
heaven
replied
the
sailor
then
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
have
you
a
mother
he
crossed
himself
again
saying
i
have
said
all
i
have
to
say
i
give
you
one
minute
longer
my
lord
and
he
cocked
the
pistol
why
do
you
call
me
lord
because
you
are
one
that
is
evident
enough
have
you
a
lord
yourself
yes
and
a
grand
one
too
is
one
likely
to
be
without
a
lord
where
is
he
i
do
not
know
he
has
left
the
country
his
name
is
marquis
de
lantenac
viscount
de
fontenay
prince
in
brittany
he
is
lord
of
the
i
never
saw
him
but
he
is
my
master
all
the
same
if
you
were
to
see
him
would
you
obey
him
of
course
i
should
be
a
heathen
were
i
not
to
obey
him
we
owe
obedience
to
god
and
after
that
to
the
king
who
is
like
unto
god
and
then
to
the
lord
who
is
like
the
king
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
you
have
killed
my
brother
and
i
must
kill
you
the
old
man
replied
let
us
say
then
that
i
did
kill
your
brother
i
did
well
the
sailor
had
closed
more
firmly
upon
his
pistol
come
he
said
so
be
it
said
the
old
man
and
he
added
composedly
where
is
the
priest
the
sailor
looked
at
him
the
priest
yes
i
gave
your
brother
a
priest
therefore
it
is
your
duty
to
provide
one
for
me
but
i
have
none
replied
the
sailor
and
he
continued
how
do
you
expect
to
find
a
priest
here
on
the
open
sea
the
convulsive
explosions
of
the
battle
sounded
more
and
more
distant
those
who
are
dying
yonder
have
their
priest
said
the
old
man
i
know
it
muttered
the
sailor
they
have
the
chaplain
the
old
man
went
on
if
you
make
me
lose
my
soul
it
will
be
a
serious
matter
the
sailor
thoughtfully
bent
his
head
and
if
my
soul
is
lost
continued
the
old
man
yours
will
be
lost
also
listen
to
me
i
feel
pity
for
you
you
shall
do
as
you
like
for
my
part
i
only
fulfilled
my
duty
when
i
first
saved
your
life
and
afterwards
took
it
from
him
and
at
the
present
moment
i
am
doing
my
duty
in
trying
to
save
your
soul
reflect
for
it
is
a
matter
that
concerns
you
do
you
hear
the
men
are
dying
over
yonder
desperate
men
in
their
last
agony
husbands
who
will
never
see
their
wives
fathers
who
will
never
see
their
children
brothers
who
like
yourself
will
never
see
their
brothers
and
who
is
to
blame
for
it
your
own
brother
you
believe
in
god
do
you
not
if
so
you
know
that
god
is
suffering
now
he
is
suffering
in
the
person
of
his
son
the
most
christian
king
of
france
who
is
a
child
like
the
child
jesus
and
who
is
now
imprisoned
in
the
temple
god
is
suffering
in
his
church
of
brittany
in
his
desecrated
cathedrals
in
his
gospels
torn
to
fragments
in
his
violated
houses
of
prayer
in
his
murdered
priests
what
were
we
about
to
do
with
that
ship
which
is
perishing
at
this
moment
we
were
going
to
the
relief
of
the
lord
if
your
brother
had
been
a
trustworthy
servant
if
he
had
performed
his
duties
faithfully
like
a
good
and
useful
man
no
misfortune
would
have
happened
to
the
carronade
the
corvette
would
not
have
been
disabled
she
would
not
have
got
out
of
her
course
and
fallen
into
the
hands
of
that
cursed
fleet
and
we
should
all
now
be
landing
in
france
brave
sailors
and
soldiers
as
we
were
sword
in
hand
with
our
white
banner
unfurled
a
multitude
of
contented
happy
men
advancing
to
the
rescue
of
the
brave
vendean
peasants
on
our
way
to
save
france
the
king
and
almighty
god
that
is
what
we
were
intending
to
do
what
we
should
have
done
and
what
i
the
only
one
remaining
still
propose
to
do
but
you
intend
to
prevent
me
in
this
struggle
of
impious
men
against
priests
in
this
conflict
of
regicides
against
the
king
of
satan
against
god
you
range
yourself
in
the
ranks
of
satan
your
brother
was
the
first
assistant
you
are
his
second
what
he
began
you
mean
to
finish
you
are
for
the
regicides
against
the
throne
you
take
sides
with
the
impious
against
the
church
you
take
away
the
lord
last
resource
for
as
i
shall
not
be
there
i
who
represent
the
king
villages
will
continue
to
burn
families
to
mourn
priests
to
bleed
brittany
to
suffer
the
king
to
remain
imprisoned
and
jesus
christ
to
grieve
over
his
people
and
who
will
have
caused
all
this
you
well
you
are
carrying
out
your
own
plans
i
expected
far
different
things
from
you
but
i
was
mistaken
it
is
true
that
i
killed
your
brother
he
played
a
brave
part
for
that
i
rewarded
him
he
was
guilty
therefore
i
punished
him
he
failed
in
his
duty
i
have
not
failed
in
mine
what
i
did
i
would
do
again
and
i
swear
by
the
great
saint
anne
of
auray
who
looks
down
on
us
that
under
like
circumstances
i
would
shoot
my
own
son
just
as
i
shot
your
brother
now
you
are
the
master
indeed
i
pity
you
you
have
broken
your
word
to
the
captain
you
christian
without
faith
you
breton
without
honor
i
was
intrusted
to
your
loyalty
and
you
accepted
the
trust
meaning
to
betray
it
you
offer
my
death
to
those
to
whom
you
have
promised
my
life
do
you
realize
whom
you
are
destroying
here
it
is
your
own
self
you
rob
the
king
of
my
life
and
you
consign
yourself
forever
to
the
devil
go
on
commit
your
crime
you
set
a
low
value
on
your
share
in
paradise
thanks
to
you
the
devil
will
conquer
thanks
to
you
the
churches
will
fall
thanks
to
you
the
heathen
will
go
on
turning
bells
into
cannon
men
will
be
shot
with
the
very
instrument
that
once
brought
to
mind
the
salvation
of
their
souls
perhaps
at
this
moment
while
i
still
speak
to
you
the
same
bell
that
pealed
for
your
baptism
is
killing
your
mother
go
on
with
the
devil
work
do
not
pause
yes
i
have
condemned
your
brother
but
learn
this
i
am
but
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
god
ah
i
you
pretend
to
judge
god
ways
you
will
next
sit
in
judgment
on
the
thunderbolt
in
the
heavens
wretched
man
you
will
be
judged
by
it
beware
what
you
do
do
you
even
know
whether
i
am
in
a
state
of
grace
no
never
mind
go
on
do
your
will
you
have
the
power
to
hurl
me
to
perdition
and
yourself
likewise
your
own
damnation
as
well
as
mine
rests
in
your
hands
you
will
be
answerable
before
god
we
are
alone
face
to
face
with
the
abyss
complete
your
work
make
an
end
of
it
i
am
old
and
you
are
young
i
have
no
weapons
you
are
armed
kill
me
while
the
old
man
standing
erect
was
uttering
these
words
in
a
voice
that
rang
above
the
tumult
of
the
sea
the
undulations
of
the
waves
showed
him
now
in
shadow
now
in
light
the
sailor
had
turned
ghostly
pale
large
drops
of
moisture
fell
from
his
brow
he
trembled
like
a
leaf
now
and
then
he
kissed
his
rosary
when
the
old
man
finished
he
threw
away
his
pistol
and
fell
on
his
knees
pardon
my
lord
forgive
me
he
cried
you
speak
like
our
lord
himself
i
have
been
wrong
my
brother
was
guilty
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
make
amends
for
his
crime
dispose
of
me
command
me
i
will
obey
i
forgive
you
said
the
old
man
ii
a
peasant
memory
is
worth
as
much
as
the
captain
science
the
provisions
with
which
the
boat
had
been
stocked
were
far
from
superfluous
for
the
two
fugitives
were
forced
to
make
long
détours
and
were
hours
in
reaching
the
coast
they
passed
the
night
at
sea
but
the
night
was
fine
with
more
moonlight
than
is
pleasing
to
people
who
wish
to
escape
observation
at
first
they
were
obliged
to
keep
away
from
the
french
coast
and
gain
the
open
sea
in
the
direction
of
jersey
they
heard
the
final
volley
from
the
unfortunate
corvette
and
it
sounded
like
the
roar
of
a
lion
whom
the
hunters
are
killing
in
the
forest
then
a
silence
fell
upon
the
sea
the
corvette
claymore
perished
like
the
vengeur
but
glory
has
kept
no
record
of
its
deeds
one
can
win
no
laurels
who
fights
against
his
native
land
halmalo
was
a
remarkable
sailor
he
performed
miracles
of
skill
and
sagacity
the
route
that
he
improvised
amid
the
reefs
the
waves
and
the
vigilance
of
the
enemy
was
a
masterpiece
the
wind
had
abated
and
the
struggle
with
the
sea
was
over
halmalo
had
avoided
the
caux
des
minquiers
and
having
rounded
the
chaussée
aux
boeufs
took
refuge
there
so
as
to
get
a
few
hours
of
rest
in
the
little
creek
formed
by
the
sea
at
low
tide
then
rowing
southward
he
continued
to
pass
between
granville
and
the
chausey
islands
without
being
noticed
by
the
lookout
either
of
chausey
or
granville
he
entered
the
bay
of
a
daring
feat
considering
that
the
cruising
squadron
was
anchored
at
cancale
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
about
an
hour
before
sunset
he
passed
the
hill
of
and
landed
on
a
shore
that
is
always
avoided
on
account
of
the
danger
from
its
shifting
sand
illustration
fortunately
the
tide
was
high
halmalo
pushed
the
boat
as
far
as
he
could
tried
the
sand
and
finding
it
firm
grounded
the
boat
and
jumped
ashore
the
old
man
following
with
eyes
turned
anxiously
towards
the
horizon
my
lord
said
halmalo
this
is
the
mouth
of
the
couesnon
we
have
beauvoir
to
starboard
and
huisnes
to
port
the
belfry
before
us
is
ardevon
the
old
man
bent
over
the
boat
took
from
it
a
biscuit
which
he
put
in
his
pocket
and
said
to
halmalo
you
may
take
the
rest
halmalo
put
what
remained
of
meat
and
biscuit
in
the
bag
and
hoisted
it
on
his
shoulder
having
done
this
he
said
my
lord
am
i
to
lead
the
way
or
to
follow
you
you
will
do
neither
halmalo
looked
at
the
old
man
in
amazement
the
latter
went
on
we
are
about
to
separate
halmalo
two
men
are
of
no
use
whatever
unless
they
are
a
thousand
it
is
better
for
one
man
to
be
alone
he
stopped
and
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
knot
of
green
silk
resembling
a
cockade
with
a
embroidered
in
gold
in
the
centre
can
you
read
he
asked
no
that
is
fortunate
a
man
who
knows
how
to
read
is
embarrassing
have
you
a
good
memory
yes
very
well
listen
halmalo
you
will
follow
the
road
on
the
right
and
i
the
one
on
the
left
you
are
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
bazouges
and
i
shall
go
towards
fougères
keep
your
bag
because
it
makes
you
look
like
a
peasant
hide
your
weapons
cut
yourself
a
stick
from
the
hedge
creep
through
the
tall
rye
glide
behind
the
hedges
climb
over
fences
and
cross
the
fields
you
will
thus
avoid
the
as
well
as
roads
and
bridges
do
not
enter
pontorson
ah
you
will
have
to
cross
the
couesnon
how
will
you
manage
that
i
shall
swim
across
excellent
then
you
will
come
to
a
ford
do
you
know
where
it
is
between
nancy
and
correct
you
are
evidently
familiar
with
the
country
but
night
is
coming
on
where
will
my
lord
sleep
i
can
take
care
of
myself
and
where
will
you
sleep
there
are
plenty
of
i
was
a
peasant
before
i
was
a
sailor
throw
away
your
sailor
hat
it
would
betray
you
you
can
surely
find
some
worsted
oh
a
cap
is
easily
found
the
first
fisherman
i
meet
will
sell
me
his
very
well
now
listen
you
are
familiar
with
the
woods
all
of
them
throughout
this
entire
neighborhood
from
noirmoutier
to
laval
do
you
know
their
names
too
i
know
the
woods
and
their
names
i
know
all
about
them
you
will
forget
nothing
nothing
good
now
mind
how
many
leagues
can
you
walk
in
a
day
ten
fifteen
eighteen
twenty
if
need
be
it
will
have
to
be
done
do
not
miss
a
word
of
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
you
will
go
to
the
woods
of
near
lamballe
yes
on
the
edge
of
a
ravine
between
and
plédéliac
there
is
a
large
you
will
stop
there
no
one
will
be
in
sight
but
a
man
will
be
there
nevertheless
on
that
i
can
depend
you
will
give
the
call
do
you
know
it
halmalo
puffed
out
his
cheeks
turned
towards
the
sea
and
there
rang
the
of
the
owl
one
would
have
supposed
it
came
from
the
depths
of
a
forest
so
and
sinister
was
the
sound
good
said
the
old
man
you
have
it
he
extended
to
halmalo
the
green
silk
knot
this
is
my
commander
badge
take
it
no
one
must
know
my
name
at
present
but
this
knot
is
sufficient
the
was
embroidered
by
madame
royale
in
the
temple
prison
halmalo
knelt
trembling
with
awe
he
received
the
knot
embroidered
with
the
and
in
the
act
of
raising
it
to
his
lips
he
paused
as
if
in
fear
may
i
he
asked
yes
since
you
kiss
the
crucifix
halmalo
kissed
the
rise
said
the
old
man
halmalo
obeyed
him
placing
the
knot
in
his
bosom
listen
carefully
to
what
i
am
about
to
say
this
is
the
order
give
no
quarter
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
of
you
will
give
the
call
repeating
it
three
times
after
the
third
time
you
will
see
a
man
rise
from
the
ground
i
know
from
a
hole
under
the
trees
that
man
will
be
planchenault
sometimes
called
to
him
you
will
show
this
knot
he
will
know
what
it
means
then
you
are
to
go
by
ways
that
you
must
discover
for
yourself
to
the
woods
of
astillé
where
you
will
see
a
cripple
surnamed
mousqueton
a
man
who
shows
mercy
to
no
human
being
you
are
to
tell
him
that
i
love
him
and
that
he
must
stir
up
the
parishes
in
his
neighborhood
thence
you
will
go
to
the
wood
of
couesbon
which
is
one
mile
from
ploërmel
when
you
give
the
a
man
will
come
out
of
a
hole
that
will
be
thuault
seneschal
of
ploërmel
who
formerly
belonged
to
the
constitutional
assembly
but
on
the
royalist
side
you
will
direct
him
to
fortify
the
castle
of
couesbon
that
belongs
to
the
marquis
de
guer
a
refugee
ravines
woods
of
moderate
extent
uneven
soil
a
good
spot
thuault
is
an
able
and
upright
man
from
there
you
will
go
to
and
speak
to
jean
chouan
whom
i
look
upon
as
the
actual
leader
and
then
to
the
woods
of
where
you
will
see
guitter
called
you
will
tell
him
to
keep
his
eye
on
a
certain
courmesnil
of
the
old
goupil
de
préfeln
and
who
is
the
head
of
the
jacobins
of
argentan
remember
all
this
i
write
nothing
because
writing
must
be
avoided
la
rouarie
made
out
a
list
which
ruined
everything
thence
you
will
go
to
the
wood
of
rougefeu
where
miélette
lives
he
who
leaps
across
ravines
by
the
help
of
a
long
pole
they
call
it
a
do
you
know
how
to
use
it
am
i
not
a
breton
peasant
the
is
our
friend
it
makes
our
arms
bigger
our
legs
longer
that
is
to
say
it
reduces
the
enemy
and
shortens
the
way
an
excellent
machine
illustration
once
with
my
i
stood
my
ground
against
three
men
armed
with
sabres
when
was
that
ten
years
ago
under
the
king
certainly
against
whom
i
really
do
not
know
i
was
a
very
good
it
was
called
fighting
against
the
collectors
of
the
is
the
tax
on
salt
the
same
thing
as
the
king
yes
and
no
but
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
understand
this
i
ask
monseigneur
pardon
for
having
put
a
question
to
monseigneur
let
us
go
on
do
you
know
the
tourgue
do
i
know
it
i
came
from
there
how
is
that
why
because
i
come
from
parigné
to
be
sure
the
tourgue
borders
on
parigné
do
i
know
the
tourgue
the
great
round
castle
belongs
to
the
family
of
my
lords
a
large
iron
door
separates
the
old
building
from
the
new
part
which
a
cannon
could
not
destroy
in
the
new
building
they
keep
the
famous
book
on
which
people
come
to
see
as
a
curiosity
the
grass
is
full
of
frogs
when
i
was
a
boy
i
used
to
play
with
those
frogs
and
the
underground
passage
too
perhaps
i
am
the
only
one
left
who
knows
about
that
what
underground
passage
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
that
was
in
old
times
when
the
tourgue
was
besieged
the
people
inside
could
escape
through
an
underground
passage
which
opened
into
the
woods
i
know
there
are
subterranean
passages
of
that
kind
in
the
châteaux
of
jupellière
and
hunaudaye
and
in
the
tower
of
champéon
but
there
is
nothing
like
it
in
the
tourgue
but
indeed
there
is
monseigneur
i
do
not
know
the
passages
of
which
monseigneur
speaks
i
only
know
the
one
in
the
tourgue
because
i
belong
in
the
neighborhood
and
besides
i
am
the
only
one
who
does
know
of
it
it
was
never
spoken
of
it
was
forbidden
because
this
passage
had
been
used
in
the
wars
of
de
rohan
my
father
knew
the
secret
and
showed
it
to
me
i
know
both
the
secret
entrance
and
the
outlet
if
i
am
in
the
forest
i
can
go
into
the
tower
and
if
i
am
in
the
tower
i
can
go
into
the
forest
without
being
seen
so
that
when
the
enemies
enter
there
is
no
one
to
be
found
that
is
the
passage
of
the
tourgue
oh
i
know
it
well
the
old
man
remained
silent
for
a
moment
you
must
be
mistaken
if
there
had
been
any
such
secret
i
should
have
known
it
monseigneur
i
am
sure
of
it
there
is
a
stone
that
turns
oh
yes
you
peasants
believe
in
in
and
in
stones
that
go
by
night
down
to
a
neighboring
brook
to
drink
a
pack
of
idle
tales
but
when
i
turned
the
stone
myself
yes
just
as
others
have
heard
it
sing
my
friend
the
tourgue
is
a
bastille
safe
and
strong
and
easily
defended
but
he
would
be
a
simpleton
indeed
who
depended
for
escape
on
a
subterranean
passage
but
monseigneur
the
old
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
let
us
waste
no
more
time
but
speak
of
business
this
peremptory
tone
checked
halmalo
persistence
the
old
man
resumed
let
us
go
on
listen
from
rougefeu
you
are
to
go
into
the
wood
of
montchevrier
where
you
will
find
bénédicité
the
leader
of
the
twelve
he
is
another
good
man
he
recites
his
while
he
has
people
shot
there
is
no
room
for
sensibility
in
warfare
from
montchevrier
you
will
go
he
broke
off
i
had
forgotten
about
the
money
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
purse
and
a
which
he
put
into
halmalo
hands
in
this
you
will
find
thirty
thousand
francs
in
paper
money
which
is
worth
about
three
livres
and
ten
sous
the
assignats
are
false
to
be
sure
but
the
real
ones
are
no
more
valuable
and
in
this
purse
mind
you
will
find
one
hundred
louis
i
give
you
all
i
have
because
i
have
no
need
of
anything
here
and
it
is
better
that
no
money
should
be
found
on
me
now
i
will
go
on
from
montchevrier

will
have
to
go
to
places
where
there
are
mountaineers
and
you
will
disguise

that
is
an
easy
matter
since
the
republicans
are
so
stupid
that
with
a
blue
coat
a
hat
and
a
cockade

may
go
anywhere
the
day

go
to
the
cantonment
of
parné
where
all
the
men
have
swarthy
faces
they
put
gravel
in
their
muskets
and
use
a
double
charge
of
powder
to
make
more
noise
they
do
well
but
be
sure
and
tell
them
to
kill
kill
and
kill
you
will
go
to
the
camp
of
the
which
is
an
elevation
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
of
la
charnie
from
to
the
camp
of
then
to
the
camp
vert
and
afterwards
to
the
camp
of
the
fourmis
you
will
go
to
also
called
where
lives
the
widow
whose
daughter
married
treton
the
englishman
that
is
in
the
parish
of
quelaines
you
will
visit
guillaume
parannes
and
all
the
men
in
hiding
throughout
the
woods
you
will
make
friends
and
you
will
send
them
to
the
borders
of
upper
and
lower
maine
you
will
see
jean
treton
in
the
parish
of
vaisges
in
bignon
chambord
in
bonchamps
the
corbin
brothers
at
maisoncelles
and
at
he
is
the
one
who
is
called
bourdoiseau
having
done
this
and
uttered
the
watchwords
quarter
in
all
these
places
you
will
join
the
royal
and
catholic
grand
army
wherever
it
may
be
you
will
see
de
lescure
de
la
rochejaquelein
and
such
leaders
as
may
still
be
living
you
will
show
them
my
commander
knot
they
know
what
it
means
you
are
only
a
sailor
but
cathelineau
is
nothing
but
a
teamster
you
will
give
them
this
message
from
me
it
is
time
to
join
the
two
wars
the
great
and
the
small
the
great
one
makes
more
noise
but
the
small
one
does
the
work
the
vendée
does
fairly
well
but
chouannerie
goes
farther
and
in
civil
war
cruelty
is
a
powerful
agent
the
success
of
a
war
depends
on
the
amount
of
evil
that
it
causes
he
broke
off
halmalo
i
tell
you
all
this
not
that
you
can
understand
the
words
but
because
your
perceptions
are
keen
and
you
will
comprehend
the
matters
themselves
i
have
trusted
you
since
i
saw
you
managing
that
boat
without
knowing
anything
of
geometry
you
execute
wonderful
sea
manoeuvres
he
who
can
pilot
a
boat
can
guide
an
insurrection
judging
from
the
way
in
which
you
managed
our
affair
at
sea
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
execute
my
instructions
equally
well
but
to
resume
so
you
will
repeat
to
the
chiefs
all
that
i
have
told
you
or
words
to
the
same
effect
as
near
as
you
can
remember
i
am
confident
that
you
will
convey
to
them
my
meaning
i
prefer
the
warfare
of
the
forest
to
that
of
the
open
field
i
have
no
intention
of
exposing
one
hundred
thousand
peasants
to
the
of
the
soldiers
in
blue
and
the
artillery
of
carnot
in
a
month
time
i
expect
to
have
five
hundred
hidden
in
the
woods
the
republican
army
is
my
game
poaching
is
one
method
of
warfare
the
strategy
of
the
thickets
for
me
ah
that
is
probably
another
word
which
you
will
not
understand
but
never
mind
you
know
what
i
mean
when
i
say
no
quarter
and
ambushes
on
every
side
give
me
more
chouannerie
rather
than
the
regular
vendean
warfare
you
will
add
that
the
english
are
on
our
side
let
us
catch
the
republic
between
two
fires
europe
helps
us
let
us
put
down
revolution
kings
are
waging
a
war
of
kingdoms
we
will
wage
a
war
of
parishes
you
will
say
all
this
do
you
understand
me
yes
put
all
to
fire
and
sword
that
is
it
no
quarter
none
whatever
you
understand
i
will
go
everywhere
and
be
always
on
your
guard
for
in
these
parts
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
lose
one
life
death
i
have
no
fear
of
he
who
takes
his
first
step
may
be
wearing
his
last
shoes
you
are
a
brave
fellow
and
if
i
am
asked
monseigneur
name
it
is
not
to
be
made
known
yet
you
are
to
say
that
you
do
not
know
it
and
you
will
say
the
truth
where
shall
i
see
monseigneur
again
at
the
place
where
i
am
going
how
shall
i
know
where
that
is
all
the
world
will
know
it
before
eight
days
have
gone
by
you
will
hear
of
me
i
shall
make
examples
i
shall
avenge
the
king
and
religion
and
you
will
know
well
enough
that
it
is
i
of
whom
they
are
speaking
i
understand
do
not
forget
anything
you
may
rest
assured
of
that
now
go
and
may
god
guide
you
go
i
will
do
all
you
bid
me
i
will
go
i
will
speak
i
will
obey
i
will
command
good
and
if
i
succeed
i
will
make
you
a
knight
of
like
my
brother
and
if
i
fail
you
will
have
me
shot
like
your
brother
so
be
it
monseigneur
the
old
man
bent
his
head
and
seemed
to
fall
into
a
gloomy
reverie
when
he
raised
his
eyes
he
was
alone
halmalo
was
only
a
black
speck
vanishing
on
the
horizon
the
sun
had
just
set
the
and
hooded
gulls
were
flying
homeward
from
the
ocean
and
the
atmosphere
was
charged
with
that
restlessness
that
precedes
the
night
the
croaked
the
kingfishers
flew
whistling
from
the
pools
the
gulls
and
rooks
kept
up
their
usual
evening
clamor
and
the
called
to
each
other
but
not
a
human
sound
was
to
be
heard
it
was
absolute
solitude
not
a
sail
on
the
bay
not
a
peasant
in
the
fields
only
a
bleak
expanse
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
tall
quivered
the
pale
twilight
sky
shed
a
livid
light
over
all
the
shore
and
the
ponds

away
on

on

the
old
man
waited
until
halmalo
was
out
of
sight
then
drawing
his
more
closely
around
him
he
started
walking
slowly
wrapt
in
thought
he
took
the
direction
of
huisnes
halmalo
had
gone
towards
beauvoir
behind
him
rose
the
enormous
triangle
of
mont
with
its
cathedral
tiara
and
its
fortress
whose
two
great
eastern
towers
the
one
round
the
other
square
help
the
mountain
to
bear
up
under
the
burden
of
the
church
and
the
village

the
pyramid

is

a

to

the
quicksands
in
the
bay
of
mont
act
imperceptibly
upon
the
dunes
at
that
time
between
huisnes
and
ardevon
there
was
a
very
high
one
which
is
no
longer
in
existence
this
dune
levelled
by
an
equinoctial
gale
was
unusually
old
and
on
its
summit
stood
a
milestone
erected
in
the
twelfth
century
in
memory
of
the
council
held
at
avranches
against
the
assassins
of
saint
thomas
of
canterbury
from
its
top
one
could
see
all
the
surrounding
country
and
ascertain
the
points
of
the
compass
the
old
man
directed
his
steps
to
this
dune
and
ascended
it
when
he
reached
the
summit
he
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
four
projecting
stones
and
leaning
back
against
the
monument
began
to
examine
the
land
that
lay
spread
out
like
a
geographical
map
at
his
feet
he
seemed
to
be
looking
for
a
route
in
a
country
that
had
once
been
familiar
to
him
in
this
broad
landscape
obscured
by
the
twilight
nothing
was
distinctly
visible
but
the
dark
line
of
the
horizon
against
the
pale
sky
one
could
see
the
clustered
roofs
of
eleven
hamlets
and
villages
and
all
the
belfries
of
the
coast
were
visible
several
miles
away
standing
high
that
they
might
serve
as
beacons
to
the
sailors
in
time
of
need
some
minutes
later
the
old
man
seemed
to
have
found
what
he
was
looking
for
in
this
dim
light
his
eye
rested
on
an
enclosure
of
trees
walls
and
roofs
partially
visible
between
the
valley
and
the
wood
it
was
a
farm
he
nodded
his
head
with
an
expression
of
satisfaction
like
one
who
says
to
himself
there
it
is
and
began
to
trace
with
his
finger
the
outlines
of
a
route
across
the
hedges
and
the
fields
from
time
to
time
he
gazed
intently
at
a
shapeless
and
somewhat
indistinct
object
that
was
moving
above
the
principal
roof
of
the
farm
and
seemed
to
ask
himself
what
it
could
be
it
was
colorless
and
dim
in
consequence
of
the
time
of
day
it
was
not
a
because
it
was
floating
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
it
should
be
a
flag
he
felt
weary
and
grateful
to
rest
on
the
stone
where
he
was
sitting
he
yielded
to
that
vague
sense
of
oblivion
which
the
first
moment
of
repose
brings
to
weary
men
there
is
one
hour
of
the
day
which
may
be
called
noiseless
the
peaceful
hour
of
early
evening
that
hour
had
come
and
he
was
enjoying
it
he
gazed
he
listened
to
what
to
perfect
tranquillity
even
savage
natures
have
their
moments
of
melancholy
suddenly
this
tranquillity
was
not
exactly
disturbed
but
sharply
defined
by
the
voices
of
those
who
were
passing
below
they
were
the
voices
of
women
and
children
it
was
like
a
joyous
chime
of
bells
heard
unexpectedly
in
the
darkness
the
group
from
which
the
voices
came
could
not
be
distinguished
on
account
of
the
underbrush
but
it
was
evident
that
the
persons
were
walking
along
the
foot
of
the
dune
in
the
direction
of
the
plain
and
the
forest
as
those
clear
fresh
voices
reached
the
old
man
where
he
sat
absorbed
in
thought
they
were
so
near
that
he
lost
not
a
word
a
woman
voice
said
let
us
hurry
flécharde
is
this
the
way
no
it
is
over
yonder
and
the
dialogue
went
on
between
the
two
voices
the
one
high
and
shrill
the
other
low
and
timid
what
is
the
name
of
this
farm
where
we
are
living
now
are
we
still
far
from
it
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
let
us
make
haste
and
get
there
in
time
for
the
soup
yes
i
know
we
are
late
we
ought
to
run
but
your
mites
are
tired
we
are
only
two
women
and
can
not
carry
three
brats
and
then
you
flécharde
you
are
carrying
one
as
it
is
a
perfect
lump
of
lead
you
have
weaned
that
little
gormandizer
and
you
still
carry
it
that
is
a
bad
habit
you
had
better
make
it
walk
well
the
soup
will
be
cold
worse
luck
ah
what
good
shoes
you
gave
me
they
fit
as
though
they
were
made
for
me
it
better
than
going
barefooted
do
hurry
he
is
the
one
who
makes
us
late
he
has
had
to
stop
and
speak
to
all
the
little
village
girls
that
we
meet
he
behaves
like
a
man
already
of
course
he
does
he
is
going
on
five
years
old
tell
us
why
did
you
speak
to
that
little
girl
in
the
village
a
child
voice
that
of
a
boy
replied
because
i
know
her
how
is
that
you
know
her
said
the
woman
yes
answered
the
boy
because
we
played
games
this
morning
illustration
well
i
must
say
exclaimed
the
woman
we
have
been
here
only
three
days
a
boy
no
bigger
than
your
fist
and
he
has
found
a
sweetheart
already
and
the
voices
grew
fainter
in
the
distance
and
every
sound
died
away
ii
aures
habet
et
non
audiet
the
old
man
sat
motionless
he
was
not
consciously
thinking
nor
yet
was
he
dreaming
around
him
was
peace
repose
assurance
of
safety
solitude
although
night
had
shut
down
upon
the
woods
and
in
the
valley
below
it
was
nearly
dark
broad
daylight
still
rested
on
the
dune
the
moon
was
rising
in
the
east
and
several
stars
pricked
the
pale
blue
of
the
zenith
this
man
although
intensely
absorbed
in
his
own
interests
surrendered
himself
to
the
unutterable
peacefulness
of
nature
he
felt
the
vague
dawn
of
hope
rising
in
his
breast
if
the
word
hope
may
fitly
be
applied
to
projects
of
civil
warfare
for
the
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
escaping
from
the
inexorable
sea
he
had
left
all
danger
behind
him
no
one
knew
his
name
he
was
alone
lost
as
far
as
concerned
the
enemy
he
had
left
no
traces
behind
him
for
the
surface
of
the
sea
preserves
no
trace
all
is
hidden
ignored
and
never
even
suspected
he
felt
unspeakably
calm
a
little
more
and
he
would
have
fallen
asleep
it
was
the
deep
silence
pervading
both
heaven
and
earth
that
lent
to
the
hour
a
subtle
charm
to
soothe
the
imagination
of
this
man
stirred
as
he
was
by
inward
and
outward
agitations
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
but
the
wind
blowing
in
from
the
sea
a
prolonged
monotonous
bass
to
which
the
ear
becomes
so
used
that
it
almost
ceases
to
be
noticed
as
a
sound
all
at
once
he
rose
to
his
feet
his
attention
was
suddenly
awakened
an
object
on
the
horizon
seemed
to
arrest
his
glance
he
was
gazing
at
the
belfry
of
cormeray
at
the
farther
end
of
the
valley
something
unusual
was
going
on
in
this
belfry
its
dark
silhouette
was
clearly
defined
against
the
sky
the
tower
surmounted
by
the
spire
could
be
seen
distinctly
and
between
the
tower
and
the
spire
was
the
square
cage
for
the
bell
without
a
penthouse
and
open
on
the
four
sides
after
the
fashion
of
breton
belfries
now
this
cage
seemed
to
open
and
shut
by
turns
and
at
regular
intervals
its
lofty
aperture
looked
now
perfectly
white
and
the
next
moment
black
the
sky
constantly
appearing
and
vanishing
eclipse
following
the
light
as
the
opening
and
shutting
succeeded
each
other
with
the
regularity
of
a
hammer
striking
an
anvil
this
belfry
of
cormeray
lay
before
him
at
a
distance
of
some
two
leagues
he
looked
towards
the
right
in
the
direction
of
the
belfry
of
which
also
rose
straight
against
the
horizon
and
the
cage
of
that
belfry
was
opening
and
closing
like
the
belfry
of
cormeray
he
looked
towards
the
left
at
the
belfry
of
tanis
the
cage
of
tanis
opened
and
closed
like
that
of
he
examined
all
the
belfries
on
the
horizon
one
after
another
the
belfries
of
courtils
of
précey
of
crollon
and
of
on
his
right
hand
those
of
of
mordray
and
of
the
pas
on
his
left
and
before
him
the
belfry
of
pontorson
every
belfry
cage
was
changing
alternately
from
white
to
black
what
could
it
mean
it
meant
that
all
the
bells
were
ringing
and
they
must
be
ringing
violently
to
cause
the
light
to
change
so
rapidly
what
was
it
then
the
tocsin
beyond
a
doubt
they
were
ringing
and
frantically
too
from
all
the
belfries
in
every
parish
and
in
every
village
and
yet
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
this
was
owing
to
the
distance
combined
with
the
which
blowing
from
the
opposite
direction
carried
all
sounds
from
the
shore
away
beyond
the
horizon
all
these
frantic
bells
ringing
on
every
side
and
at
the
same
time
this
silence
what
could
be
more
appalling
the
old
man
looked
and
listened
he
could
not
hear
the
tocsin
but
he
could
see
it
seeing
the
tocsin
is
rather
a
strange
sensation
against
whom
was
this
fury
directed
against
whom
was
the
tocsin
ringing
iii
the
usefulness
of
big
letters
some
one
was
surely
caught
in
a
trap
who
could
it
be
a
shudder
shook
this
man
of
steel
it
could
not
be
he
his
arrival
could
not
have
been
discovered
it
was
impossible
for
the
representatives
to
have
learned
it
already
for
he
had
but
just
stepped
on
shore
the
corvette
had
surely
foundered
with
all
on
board
and
even
on
the
corvette
boisberthelot
and
la
vieuville
were
the
only
men
who
knew
his
name
the
bells
kept
up
their
savage
sport
he
counted
them
mechanically
and
in
the
abrupt
transition
from
the
assurance
of
perfect
safety
to
a
terrible
sense
of
danger
his
thoughts
wandered
restlessly
from
one
conjecture
to
another
however
after
all
this
ringing
might
be
accounted
for
in
many
different
ways
and
he
finally
reassured
himself
by
repeating
in
short
no
one
knows
of
my
arrival
here
or
even
my
name
for
several
minutes
there
had
been
a
slight
noise
overhead
and
behind
him
a
sound
resembling
the
rustling
of
a
leaf
at
first
he
took
no
notice
of
it
but
as
it
continued
persisted
one
might
almost
say
he
finally
turned
it
was
really
a
leaf
a
leaf
of
paper
the
wind
was
struggling
to
tear
off
a
large
placard
that
was
pasted
on
the
milestone
above
his
head
the
placard
had
but
just
been
pasted
for
it
was
still
moist
and
had
become
a
prey
to
the
wind
which
in
its
sport
had
partly
detached
it
the
old
man
had
not
perceived
it
because
he
had
ascended
the
dune
on
the
opposite
side
he
stepped
up
on
the
stone
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
placed
his
hand
on
the
corner
of
the
placard
that
fluttered
in
the
wind
the
sky
was
clear
in
june
the
twilight
lasts
a
long
time
and
although
it
was
dark
at
the
foot
of
the
dune
the
summit
was
still
light
a
part
of
the
notice
was
printed
in
large
letters
it
was
yet
sufficiently
light
to
read
it
and
this
was
what
he
read
the
french
republic
one
and
indivisible
we
prieur
of
the
marne
representative
of
the
people
in
command
of
the
army
on
the
coast
of
cherbourg
give
notice
that
the
marquis
of
lantenac
viscount
of
fontenay
calling
himself
a
breton
prince
and
who
has
secretly
landed
on
the
coast
of
granville
is
outlawed
a
price
has
been
set
upon
his
head
whoever
captures
him
dead
or
alive
will
receive
sixty
thousand
livres
this
sum
will
be
paid
in
gold
and
not
in
paper
money
a
battalion
of
the
army
of
the
coast
guards
of
cherbourg
will
be
at
once
despatched
for
the
apprehension
of
the
former
marquis
of
lantenac
the
inhabitants
of
the
parishes
are
ordered
to
lend
their
aid
given
at
the
town
hall
of
granville
the
second
of
june
signed
prieur
de
la
marne
below
this
name
there
was
another
signature
written
in
smaller
characters
which
the
fading
light
prevented
him
from
deciphering
pulling
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
muffling
himself
in
his
up
to
his
chin
the
old
man
hastily
descended
the
dune
evidently
it
was
not
safe
to
tarry
any
longer
on
this
lighted
summit
perhaps
he
had
stayed
there
too
long
already
the
top
of
the
dune
was
the
only
point
of
the
landscape
that
still
remained
visible
when
he
had
descended
and
found
himself
in
the
darkness
he
slackened
his
pace
he
took
the
road
leading
to
the
farm
which
he
had
traced
out
evidently
believing
himself
safe
in
that
direction
it
was
absolute
solitude
there
were
no
at
this
hour
stopping
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
he
unfastened
his
cloak
turned
his
waistcoat
with
the
hairy
side
out
refastened
his
cloak
that
was
but
a
rag
held
by
a
string
around
his
neck
and
resumed
his
journey
it
was
bright
moonlight
he
came
to
a
place
where
two
roads
forked
and
on
the
pedestal
of
the
old
stone
cross
which
stood
there
a
white
square
could
be
distinguished
undoubtedly
another
placard
like
the
one
he
had
lately
read
as
he
drew
near
to
it
he
heard
a
voice
illustration
where
are
you
going
it
said
and
turning
he
beheld
a
man
in
the
tall
like
himself
and
of
about
the
same
age
with
hair
as
white
and
garments
even
more
ragged
than
his
own
almost
his
very
double
the
man
stood
leaning
on
a
long
staff
i
asked
you
where
you
were
going
he
repeated
in
the
first
place
tell
me
where
i
am
was
the
reply
uttered
in
tones
of
almost
haughty
composure
and
the
man
answered
you
are
in
the
seigneury
of
tanis
of
which
i
am
the
beggar
and
you
the
lord
i
yes
you
monsieur
le
marquis
de
lantenac
iv
the
caimand
the
marquis
de
lantenac
henceforth
we
shall
call
him
by
his
name
replied
gravely
very
well
then
deliver
me
up
the
man
continued
we
are
both
at
home
here
you
in
the
castle
i
in
the
bushes
let
us
put
an
end
to
this
do
what
you
have
to
do
deliver
me
to
the
authorities
said
the
marquis
the
man
went
on
you
were
going
to
the
farm
were
you
not
yes
do
go
there
why
not
because
the
blues
are
there
how
long
have
they
been
there
these
three
days
past
did
the
inhabitants
of
the
farm
and
village
resist
no
they
opened
all
the
doors
ah
said
the
marquis
the
man
indicated
with
his
finger
the
roof
of
the
farm
which
was
visible
in
the
distance
above
the
trees
do
you
see
that
roof
marquis
yes
do
you
see
what
there
is
above
it
something
waving
yes
it
is
a
flag
the
tricolor
said
the
man
it
was
the
object
that
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
marquis
when
he
stood
on
the
top
of
the
dune
is
the
tocsin
ringing
inquired
the
marquis
yes
on
what
account
evidently
on
yours
but
one
can
not
hear
it
the
wind
prevents
it
from
being
heard
the
man
continued
did
you
see
that
notice
about
yourself
yes
they
are
searching
for
you
then
glancing
towards
the
farm
he
added
they
have
a
over
there
of
republicans
of
parisians
well
said
the
marquis
let
us
go
on
and
he
made
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
farm
the
man
seized
him
by
the
arm
do
go
there
where
would
you
have
me
go
with
me
the
marquis
looked
at
the
beggar
listen
to
me
marquis
my
home
is
not
a
fine
one
but
it
is
safe
a
hut
lower
than
a
cellar
seaweed
for
a
floor
and
for
a
ceiling
a
roof
of
branches
and
of
grass
come
they
would
shoot
you
at
the
farm
and
at
my
house
you
will
have
a
chance
to
sleep
you
must
be
weary
the
blues
start
out
again
and
you
can
go
where
you
choose
the
marquis
studied
the
man
on
which
side
are
you
then
asked
the
marquis
are
you
a
royalist
or
a
republican
i
am
a
beggar
neither
royalist
nor
republican
i
believe
not
are
you
for
or
against
the
king
i
have
no
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
what
do
you
think
of
what
is
transpiring
i
think
that
i
have
not
enough
to
live
on
yet
you
come
to
my
aid
i
knew
that
you
were
outlawed
what
is
this
law
then
that
one
can
be
outside
of
it
i
do
not
understand
am
i
inside
the
law
or
outside
of
it
i
have
no
idea
does
dying
of
hunger
mean
being
inside
the
law
how
long
have
you
been
dying
of
hunger
all
my
life
and
you
propose
to
save
me
yes
why
because
i
said
to
myself
is
a
man
who
is
poorer
than
i
for
he
has
not
even
the
right
to
breathe
true
and
so
you
mean
to
save
me
certainly
now
we
are
brothers
my
lord
beggars
both
i
for
bread
and
you
for
life
but
do
you
know
there
is
a
price
set
on
my
head
yes
how
did
you
know
it
i
have
read
the
notice
then
you
can
read
yes
and
write
also
did
you
think
i
was
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
but
since
you
can
read
and
have
seen
the
notice
you
must
know
that
he
who
delivers
me
up
will
receive
sixty
thousand
francs
i
know
it
not
in
assignats
yes
i
know
in
gold
you
realize
that
sixty
thousand
francs
is
a
fortune
yes
and
that
the
man
who
arrests
me
will
make
his
fortune
yes
and
what
then
his
fortune
that
is
exactly
what
i
thought
when
i
saw
you
i
said
to
myself
think
that
whoever
arrests
this
man
will
earn
sixty
thousand
francs
and
make
his
fortune
let
us
make
haste
to
hide
him
the
marquis
followed
the
beggar
they
entered
a
thicket
there
was
the
beggar
den
a
sort
of
chamber
in
which
a
large
and
ancient
oak
had
allowed
the
man
to
take
up
his
abode
it
was
hollowed
out
under
its
roots
and
covered
with
its
branches
dark
low
hidden
actually
invisible
and
in
it
there
was
room
for
two
i
foresaw
that
i
might
have
a
guest
said
the
beggar
this
kind
of
subterranean
lodging
less
rare
in
brittany
than
one
might
imagine
is
called
a
the
same
name
is
also
given
to
built
in
thick
walls
the
place
was
furnished
with
a
few
jugs
a
bed
of
straw
or
washed
and
dried
a
coarse
kersey
blanket
and
a
few
tallow
dips
together
with
a
flint
and
steel
and
twigs
of
furze
to
be
used
as
matches
they
stooped
crawling
for
a
moment
and
penetrated
into
a
chamber
divided
by
the
thick
roots
of
the
tree
into
fantastic
compartments
and
seated
themselves
on
the
heap
of
dry
that
served
as
a
bed
the
space
between
the
two
roots
through
which
they
had
entered
and
which
served
as
a
door
admitted
a
certain
amount
of
light
night
had
fallen
but
the
human
eye
adapts
itself
to
the
change
of
light
and
even
in
the
darkness
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
the
daylight
lingered
still
the
reflection
of
a
moonbeam
illumined
the
entrance
in
the
corner
was
a
jug
of
water
a
loaf
of
buckwheat
bread
and
some
chestnuts
let
us
sup
said
the
beggar
they
divided
the
chestnuts
the
marquis
gave
his
bit
of
they
ate
of
the
same
black
loaf
and
drank
in
turn
out
of
the
same
jug
of
water
meanwhile
conversing
illustration
the
marquis
questioned
the
man
so
it
is
all
one
to
you
whatever
happens
pretty
much
it
is
for
you
who
are
lords
to
look
out
for
that
sort
of
business
but
then
what
is
going
on
now
for
instance
it
is
all
going
on
over
my
head
the
beggar
added
besides
there
are
things
happening
still
higher
the
sun
rises
the
moon
waxes
and
wanes
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
interests
me
he
took
a
swallow
from
the
jug
and
said
good
fresh
water
then
he
continued
how
do
you
like
this
water
my
lord
what
is
your
name
asked
the
marquis
my
name
is
tellmarch
but
they
call
me
the
caimand
i
understand
is
a
local
word
which
means
beggar
i
am
also
called
le
vieux
he
went
on
i
have
been
called
le
vieux
for
forty
years
forty
years
but
you
must
have
been
young
then
i
was
never
young
you
are
young
still
marquis
you
have
the
legs
of
a
man
of
twenty
you
can
climb
the
great
dune
while
i
can
hardly
walk
a
quarter
of
a
mile
tires
me
out
yet
we
are
of
the
same
age
but
the
rich
have
an
advantage
over
us
they
eat
every
day
eating
keeps
up
one
strength
after
a
silence
the
beggar
went
on
wealth
and
poverty
there
the
mischief
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
cause
of
all
these
catastrophes
the
poor
want
to
be
rich
and
the
rich
do
not
want
to
become
poor
i
think
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
but
i
do
not
trouble
myself
about
such
matters
let
come
what
may
i
am
neither
for
the
creditor
nor
for
the
debtor
i
know
that
there
is
a
debt
and
somebody
is
paying
it
that
is
all
i
would
rather
they
had
not
killed
the
king
and
yet
i
hardly
know
why
and
then
one
says
to
me
how
they
used
to
hang
people
for
nothing
at
all
think
of
it
for
a
miserable
shot
fired
at
one
of
the
king
deer
i
once
saw
a
man
hung
he
had
a
wife
and
seven
children
there
is
something
to
be
said
on
both
sides
he
was
silent
again
then
resumed
of
course
you
understand
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
just
how
matters
stand
men
go
to
and
fro
changes
take
place
while
i
live
beneath
the
stars
again
tellmarch
became
thoughtful
then
went
on
i
know
something
of
and
medicine
i
am
familiar
with
herbs
and
the
use
of
plants
the
peasants
see
me
preoccupied
for
no
apparent
reason
and
so
i
pass
for
a
wizard
because
i
dream
they
think
that
i
am
wise
do
you
belong
to
the
neighborhood
asked
the
marquis
i
have
never
left
it
do
you
know
me
certainly
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
were
passing
through
this
part
of
the
country
on
your
way
to
england
that
was
two
years
ago
just
now
i
saw
a
man
on
the
top
of
the
dune
a
tall
man
tall
men
are
not
common
hereabouts
brittany
is
a
country
of
short
men
i
looked
more
closely
i
had
read
the
notice
and
i
said
to
myself
here
and
when
you
came
down
the
moon
was
up
and
i
recognized
you
but
i
do
not
know
you
you
have
looked
at
me
but
you
never
saw
me
and
tellmarch
the
caimand
added
i
saw
you
the
and
the
beggar
look
with
different
eyes
have
i
ever
met
you
before
often
for
i
am
your
beggar
i
used
to
beg
on
the
road
below
your
castle
sometimes
you
gave
me
alms
he
who
gives
takes
no
notice
but
he
who
receives
looks
anxiously
and
observes
well
a
beggar
is
a
born
spy
but
though
i
am
often
sad
i
try
not
to
be
a
malicious
spy
i
used
to
hold
out
my
hand
and
you
saw
nothing
but
that
into
which
you
threw
the
alms
that
i
needed
in
the
morning
to
keep
me
from
dying
of
hunger
at
night
frequently
i
went
hours
without
food
sometimes
a
penny
means
life
itself
i
am
paying
you
now
for
the
life
i
owe
you
true
you
are
saving
my
life
yes
i
am
saving
your
life
monseigneur
the
voice
of
tellmarch
grew
solemn
on
one
condition
what
is
that
that
you
have
not
come
here
to
do
harm
i
have
come
here
to
do
good
let
us
sleep
said
the
beggar
they
lay
down
side
by
side
on
the
bed
of
the
beggar
dropped
to
sleep
at
once
the
marquis
although
much
fatigued
remained
awake
for
some
time
thinking
and
watching
his
companion
in
the
darkness
finally
he
lay
back
lying
upon
the
bed
was
equivalent
to
lying
on
the
earth
and
he
took
advantage
of
this
to
put
his
ear
to
the
ground
and
listen
he
could
hear
a
hollow
subterranean
rumbling
it
is
a
fact
that
sound
is
transmitted
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
he
could
hear
the
ringing
of
the
bells
the
tocsin
continued
the
marquis
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
it
was
daylight
the
beggar
was
standing
up
not
in
his
den
for
it
was
impossible
to
stand
erect
there
but
outside
on
the
threshold
he
was
leaning
on
his
staff
and
the
sunshine
fell
upon
his
face
monseigneur
said
tellmarch
it
has
just
struck
four
from
the
belfry
of
tanis
i
heard
it
strike
therefore
the
wind
has
changed
it
comes
from
the
land
and
as
i
heard
no
other
sound
the
tocsin
must
have
ceased
all
is
quiet
at
the
farm
and
in
the
village
of
the
blues
are
either
sleeping
or
gone
the
worst
of
the
danger
is
over
it
will
be
prudent
for
us
to
separate
this
is
my
time
for
going
out
he
indicated
a
point
in
the
horizon
i
am
going
this
way
then
pointing
in
the
opposite
direction
he
said
you
are
to
go
that
way
the
beggar
gravely
waved
his
hand
to
the
marquis
take
those
chestnuts
with
you
if
you
are
hungry
he
added
pointing
to
the
remains
of
the
supper
a
moment
after
he
had
disappeared
among
the
trees
the
marquis
rose
and
went
in
the
direction
indicated
by
tellmarch
it
was
that
charming
hour
called
in
the
old
norman
peasant
dialect
the
peep
of
day
the
chirping
of
the
finches
and
of
the
was
heard
the
marquis
followed
the
path
that
they
had
traversed
the
day
before
and
as
he
emerged
from
the
thicket
he
found
himself
at
the
fork
of
the
roads
marked
by
the
stone
cross
the
placard
was
still
there
looking
white
and
almost
festive
in
the
rising
sun
he
remembered
that
there
was
something
at
the
foot
of
this
notice
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
read
the
evening
before
on
account
of
the
small
characters
and
the
fading
light
he
went
up
to
the
pedestal
of
the
cross
below
the
signature
prieur
de
la
marne
the
notice
ended
with
the
following
lines
in
small
characters
the
identity
of
the
marquis
of
lantenac
having
been
established
he
will
be
executed
without
delay
signed
gauvain
of
battalion
in
command
of
exploring
gauvain
said
the
marquis
he
paused
wrapt
in
deep
thought
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
placard
gauvain
he
repeated
he
started
once
more
turned
looked
at
the
cross
came
back
and
read
the
placard
over
again
then
he
slowly
walked
away
had
any
one
been
near
he
might
have
heard
him
mutter
to
himself
in
an
undertone
gauvain
the
roofs
of
the
farm
on
his
left
were
not
visible
from
the
sunken
paths
through
which
he
was
stealing
he
skirted
a
precipitous
hill
covered
with
blossoming
furze
of
the
species
known
as
the
thorny
furze
this
eminence
was
crowned
by
one
of
those
points
of
land
called
in
this
district
a
and
at
its
base
the
trees
cut
off
the
view
at
once
the
foliage
seemed
bathed
in
light
all
nature
felt
the
deep
joy
of
morning
suddenly
this
landscape
became
terrible
it
was
like
the
explosion
of
an
ambuscade
an
indescribable
tornado
of
wild
cries
and
fell
upon
these
fields
and
woods
all
radiant
with
the
morning
light
and
from
the
direction
of
the
farm
rose
a
dense
smoke
mingled
with
bright
flames
as
though
the
village
and
the
farm
were
but
a
truss
of
burning
straw
it
was
not
only
startling
but
awful
this
sudden
change
from
peace
to
wrath
like
an
explosion
of
hell
in
the
very
midst
of
dawn
a
horror
without
transition
a
fight
was
going
on
in
the
direction
of
the
marquis
paused
no
man
in
a
case
like
this
could
have
helped
feeling
as
he
did
curiosity
is
more
powerful
than
fear
one
must
find
out
what
is
going
on
even
at
the
risk
of
life
he
climbed
the
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
lay
the
sunken
path
from
there
although
the
chances
were
that
he
would
be
discovered
he
could
at
least
see
what
was
taking
place
in
a
few
moments
he
stood
on
the
and
looked
about
him
in
fact
there
was
both
a
fusillade
and
a
fire
one
could
hear
the
cries
and
see
the
fire
the
farm
was
evidently
the
centre
of
some
mysterious
catastrophe
what
could
it
be
was
it
attacked
and
if
so
by
whom
could
it
be
a
battle
was
it
not
more
likely
to
be
a
military
execution
by
the
orders
of
a
revolutionary
decree
the
blues
frequently
punished
refractory
farms
and
villages
by
setting
them
on
fire
for
instance
every
farm
and
hamlet
which
had
neglected
to
fell
the
trees
as
prescribed
by
law
and
had
not
opened
roads
in
the
thickets
for
the
passage
of
republican
cavalry
was
burned
it
was
not
long
since
the
parish
of
bourgon
near
ernée
had
been
thus
punished
was
a
case
in
point
it
was
evident
that
none
of
those
strategic
openings
ordered
by
the
decree
had
been
cut
either
in
the
thickets
or
in
the
environs
of
tanis
and
was
this
the
punishment
thereof
had
an
order
been
received
by
the
advanced
guard
occupying
the
farm
did
not
this
advanced
guard
form
a
part
of
one
of
those
exploring
columns
called
the
eminence
on
which
the
marquis
had
stationed
himself
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
wild
and
bristling
thicket
called
the
grove
of
it
was
about
as
large
as
a
forest
however
and
extended
to
the
farm
concealing
as
all
breton
thickets
do
a
network
of
ravines
paths
and
sunken
roads
labyrinths
wherein
the
republican
armies
frequently
went
astray
this
execution
if
execution
it
were
must
have
been
a
fierce
one
for
it
had
been
rapid
like
all
brutal
deeds
it
had
been
done
like
a
flash
the
atrocity
of
civil
war
admits
of
these
savage
deeds
while
the
marquis
vainly
conjecturing
and
hesitating
whether
to
descend
or
to
remain
listened
and
watched
this
crash
of
extermination
ceased
or
to
speak
more
accurately
vanished
the
marquis
could
see
the
fierce
and
jubilant
troop
as
it
scattered
through
the
grove
there
was
a
dreadful
rushing
to
and
fro
beneath
the
trees
from
the
farm
they
had
entered
the
woods
drums
beat
an
attack
but
there
was
no
more
firing
it
was
like
a
they
seemed
to
be
following
a
scent
they
were
evidently
looking
for
some
one
the
noise
was
and
there
were
confused
outcries
of
wrath
and
triumph
a
clamor
of
indistinct
sounds
suddenly
as
an
outline
is
revealed
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
one
sound
became
clearly
defined
and
audible
in
this
tumult
it
was
a
name
repeated
by
thousands
of
voices
and
the
marquis
distinctly
heard
the
cry
lantenac
lantenac
the
marquis
of
lantenac
they
were
looking
for
him
vi
the
vicissitudes
of
civil
war
around
him
suddenly
from
all
directions
the
thicket
was
filled
with
muskets
bayonets
and
sabres
a
tricolored
banner
was
unfurled
in
the
dim
light
and
the
cry
lantenac
burst
forth
on
his
ears
while
at
his
feet
through
the
brambles
and
branches
savage
faces
appeared
the
marquis
was
standing
alone
on
the
top
of
the
height
visible
from
every
part
of
the
wood
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
those
who
shouted
his
name
but
he
could
be
seen
by
all
had
there
been
a
thousand
muskets
in
the
wood
he
offered
them
a
target
he
could
distinguish
nothing
in
the
coppice
but
the
fiery
eyes
of
all
were
directed
upon
him
he
took
off
his
hat
turned
back
the
brim
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
a
white
cockade
he
pulled
out
a
long
dry
thorn
from
a
with
which
he
fastened
the
cockade
to
the
brim
of
his
hat
then
replaced
it
on
his
head
the
upturned
brim
revealing
his
forehead
and
the
cockade
and
in
a
loud
voice
as
though
addressing
the
wide
forest
he
said
i
am
the
man
you
seek
i
am
the
marquis
de
lantenac
viscount
de
fontenay
breton
prince
of
the
armies
of
the
king
make
an
end
of
it
aim
fire
and
opening
with
both
hands
his
waistcoat
he
bared
his
breast
lowering
his
eyes
to
see
the
levelled
guns
he
beheld
himself
surrounded
by
kneeling
men
a
great
shout
went
up
long
live
lantenac
long
live
our
lord
long
live
the
general
at
the
same
time
hats
were
thrown
up
and
sabres
whirled
joyously
while
from
all
sides
brown
woollen
caps
hoisted
on
long
poles
were
waving
in
the
air
a
vendean
band
surrounded
him
illustration
at
the
sight
of
him
they
fell
on
their
knees
legends
tell
us
that
the
ancient
thuringian
forests
were
inhabited
by
strange
beings
a
race
of
giants
at
once
superior
and
inferior
to
men
whom
the
romans
regarded
as
horrible
beasts
and
the
germans
as
divine
incarnations
and
who
might
chance
to
be
exterminated
or
worshipped
according
to
the
race
they
encountered
a
sensation
similar
to
that
which
may
have
been
felt
by
one
of
those
beings
was
experienced
by
the
marquis
when
expecting
to
be
treated
like
a
monster
he
was
suddenly
worshipped
as
a
deity
all
those
flashing
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him
with
a
kind
of
savage
love
the
crowd
were
armed
with
guns
sabres
scythes
poles
and
sticks
all
wore
large
felt
hats
or
brown
caps
with
white
cockades
a
profusion
of
rosaries
and
charms
wide
breeches
left
open
at
the
knee
jackets
of
skin
and
leather
gaiters
the
calves
of
their
legs
were
bare
and
they
wore
their
hair
long
some
looked
fierce
but
all
had
frank
and
open
countenances
a
young
man
of
noble
bearing
passed
through
the
crowd
of
kneeling
men
and
hastily
approached
the
marquis
he
wore
a
felt
hat
with
an
upturned
brim
a
white
cockade
and
a
skin
jacket
like
the
peasants
but
his
hands
were
delicate
and
his
linen
was
fine
and
over
his
waistcoat
was
a
white
silk
scarf
from
which
hung
a
sword
with
a
golden
hilt
having
reached
the
he
threw
aside
his
hat
unfastened
his
scarf
and
kneeling
presented
to
the
marquis
both
scarf
and
sword
indeed
we
were
seeking
for
you
he
said
and
we
have
found
you
receive
the
sword
of
command
these
men
are
yours
now
i
was
their
commander
now
am
i
promoted
since
i
become
your
soldier
accept
our
devotion
my
lord
general
give
me
your
orders
at
a
sign
from
him
men
carrying
the
tricolored
banner
came
forth
from
the
woods
and
going
up
to
the
marquis
placed
it
at
his
feet
it
was
the
one
he
had
seen
through
the
trees
general
said
the
young
man
who
presented
the
sword
and
the
scarf
this
is
the
flag
which
we
took
from
the
blues
who
held
the
farm
my
name
is
gavard
my
lord
i
was
with
the
marquis
de
la
rouarie
very
well
said
the
marquis
illustration
and
calm
and
composed
he
girded
on
the
scarf
then
he
pulled
out
his
sword
and
waving
it
above
his
head
he
cried
rise
and
long
live
the
king
all
started
to
their
feet
then
from
the
depth
of
the
woods
arose
a
tumultuous
and
triumphant
cry
long
live
the
king
long
live
our
marquis
long
live
lantenac
the
marquis
turned
towards
gavard
how
many
are
you
seven
thousand
while
they
were
descending
the
hill
the
peasants
clearing
away
the
to
make
a
path
for
the
marquis
de
lantenac
gavard
continued
all
this
may
be
explained
in
a
word
my
lord
nothing
could
be
more
simple
it
needed
but
a
spark
the
republican
placard
in
revealing
your
presence
has
roused
the
country
for
the
king
besides
we
have
been
secretly
notified
by
the
mayor
of
granville
who
is
one
of
us
the
same
who
saved
the
abbé
ollivier
they
rang
the
tocsin
last
night
for
whom
for
you
ah
said
the
marquis
and
here
we
are
continued
gavard
and
you
number
seven
thousand
but
we
shall
be
fifteen
thousand
it
is
the
breton
contingent
when
monsieur
henri
de
la
rochejaquelein
went
to
join
the
catholic
army
they
sounded
the
tocsin
and
in
one
night
six
parishes
isernay
corqueux
échaubroignes
aubiers
sainte
aubin
and
nueil
sent
him
ten
thousand
men
they
had
no
munitions
of
war
but
having
found
at
a
quarryman
house
sixty
pounds
of
monsieur
de
la
rochejaquelein
took
his
departure
with
that
we
felt
sure
you
must
be
somewhere
in
these
woods
and
we
were
looking
for
you
and
you
attacked
the
blues
at
the
farm
the
wind
prevented
them
from
hearing
the
tocsin
and
they
mistrusted
nothing
the
population
of
the
hamlet
a
set
of
clowns
received
them
well
this
morning
we
invested
the
farm
while
the
blues
were
sleeping
and
the
thing
was
over
in
a
trice
i
have
a
horse
here
will
you
deign
to
accept
it
general
yes
a
peasant
led
up
a
white
horse
with
military
housings
the
marquis
mounted
him
without
accepting
gavard
proffered
assistance
hurrah
cried
the
peasants
the
english
fashion
of
cheering
is
much
in
vogue
on
the
breton
coast
for
the
people
have
continual
dealings
with
the
channel
islands
gavard
made
the
military
salute
asking
as
he
did
so
where
will
you
establish
your
headquarters
my
lord
at
first
in
the
forest
of
fougères
it
is
one
of
the
seven
forests
belonging
to

one
who

the
curate
of
the

know
him
he
has
made
the
trip
to

a
priest
stepped
out
from
the
ranks
and
said
three
times
the
marquis
turned
his
head
good
morning
monsieur
le
curé
there

work
in
store
for
you
so
much

better
monsieur
le
marquis

services

forced
marquis
said
the
priest
at
guéménée
gaston
compels
the
republicans
to
confess
he
is
a
hairdresser
the
dying
should
be
allowed
free
choice
in
such
a
matter
gavard
who
had
gone
away
to
give
certain
orders

i

the

were
friendly
to
the
blues
yes
general

the
farm

did
you

the
hamlet

the
blues
tried
to
defend
themselves
but
they
numbered
one
hundred
and
fifty
while
we
were
seven
thousand
what
blues

they
those
of

and
the
marquis
spurred
his
horse
forward
vii
no
mercy
no
quarter
while
these
events
were
transpiring
in
the
vicinity
of
tanis
the
beggar
had
gone
towards
crollon
he
plunged
into
the
ravines
under
wide
leafy
bowers
heedless
of
all
things
noticing
nothing
as
he
himself
had
expressed
it
dreaming
rather
than
thinking
for
the
thinker
has
an
object
but
the
dreamer
has
none
wandering
rambling
pausing
munching
here
and
there
a
sprig
of
wild
sorrel
drinking
at
the
springs
raising
his
head
from
time
to
time
as
distant
sounds
attracted
his
attention
then
yielding
again
to
the
irresistible
fascination
of
nature
presenting
his
rags
to
the
sunlight
hearing
human
sounds
by
chance
but
listening
to
the
singing
of
birds
he
was
old
and
slow
as
he
told
the
marquis
of
lantenac
he
could
not
go
far
a
quarter
of
a
mile
fatigued
him
he
made
a
short
circuit
towards
and
it
was
evening
when
he
returned
a
little
beyond
macey
the
path
he
followed
led
him
to
a
sort
of
elevation
destitute
of
trees
which
commanded
a
wide
expanse
of
country
including
the
entire
horizon
from
the
west
as
far
as
the
sea
a
smoke
attracted
his
attention
there
is
nothing
more
delightful
than
a
smoke
and
nothing
more
alarming
there
are
smokes
signifying
peace
and
smokes
that
mean
mischief
in
the
density
and
color
of
a
column
of
smoke
lies
all
the
difference
between
war
and
peace
brotherly
love
and
hatred
hospitality
and
the
grave
life
and
death
a
smoke
rising
among
the
trees
may
mean
the
sweetest
thing
in
all
the
world
the
family
hearth
or
the
most
dreadful
of
calamities
a
conflagration
and
the
entire
happiness
or
misery
of
a
human
being
is
sometimes
centred
in
a
vapor
scattered
by
the
wind
the
smoke
which
tellmarch
saw
was
of
a
kind
to
excite
anxiety
it
was
black
with
sudden
flashes
of
red
light
as
though
the
furnace
from
whence
it
sprung
burned
fitfully
and
was
gradually
dying
out
and
it
rose
above
tellmarch
hurried
along
walking
towards
the
smoke
he
was
tired
but
he
wanted
to
know
what
it
meant
he
reached
the
top
of
a
hillock
behind
which
nestled
a
hamlet
and
the
farm
neither
farm
nor
hamlet
was
to
be
seen
a
heap
of
ruins
was
still
burning
all
that
remained
of
it
is
much
more
to
see
a
cottage
burn
than
a
palace
a
cottage
in
flames
is
a
pitiful
sight
devastation
swooping
down
on
poverty
a
vulture
pouncing
upon
an
there
is
a
sense
of
repugnance
about
it
that
makes
one
shudder
if
we
believe
the
biblical
legend
the
sight
of
a
conflagration
once
turned
a
human
being
into
a
statue
for
an
instant
a
similar
change
came
over
tellmarch
the
sight
before
his
eyes
transfixed
him
to
the
spot
the
work
of
destruction
went
on
in
silence
not
a
cry
was
heard
not
a
human
sigh
mingled
with
the
smoke
that
furnace
pursued
its
task
of
devouring
the
village
with
no
other
sound
than
the
splitting
of
timbers
and
the
crackling
of
thatch
from
time
to
time
the
clouds
of
smoke
were
rent
the
falling
roofs
revealed
the
gaping
chambers
the
fiery
furnace
displayed
all
its
rubies
the
poor
rags
turned
scarlet
and
the
wretched
old
furniture
tinged
with
purple
stood
out
amid
these
dull
red
interiors
tellmarch
was
dazed
by
the
terrible
calamity
several
trees
of
a
neighboring
had
caught
fire
and
were
in
a
blaze
he
listened
trying
to
hear
a
voice
a
call
or
some
kind
of
a
noise
nothing
stirred
but
the
flames
all
was
still
save
the
fire
had
all
the
inhabitants
fled
where
was
the
community
that
lived
and
labored
at
what
had
become
of
this
little
family
tellmarch
descended
the
hillock
a
gloomy
enigma
lay
before
him
he
approached
it
slowly
gazing
at
it
steadily
he
advanced
towards
the
ruin
with
the
deliberation
of
a
shadow
feeling
like
a
ghost
in
this
tomb
having
reached
what
had
formerly
been
the
door
of
the
farm
he
looked
into
the
yard
whose
ruined
walls
no
longer
separated
it
from
the
surrounding
hamlet
what
he
had
seen
before
was
nothing
as
compared
with
what
he
now
beheld
from
afar
he
had
seen
the
terror
of
it
now
all
its
horrors
lay
before
him
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
was
a
dark
mass
vaguely
outlined
on
one
side
by
the
flames
and
on
the
other
by
the
moonlight
it
was
a
heap
of
men
and
these
men
were
dead
around
this
mound
lay
a
wide
pool
still
smoking
whose
surface
reflected
the
flames
but
it
needed
not
the
fire
to
redden
it
it
was
of
blood
tellmarch
went
up
to
it
he
examined
one
after
another
these
prostrate
bodies
all
were
corpses
both
the
moon
and
the
conflagration
lighted
up
the
scene
the
dead
bodies
were
those
of
soldiers
every
man
had
bare
feet
both
their
shoes
and
their
weapons
had
been
taken
from
them
but
they
still
wore
their
blue
uniforms
here
and
there
one
could
distinguish
amid
the
confusion
of
the
limbs
and
heads
hats
bearing
the
tricolor
cockades
riddled
with
bullets
they
were
republicans
the
same
parisians
who
the
previous
evening
had
been
living
active
men
garrisoned
at
the
farm
the
symmetrical
arrangement
of
the
fallen
bodies
proved
the
affair
to
have
been
an
execution
they
had
been
shot
on
the
spot
and
with
precision
they
were
all
dead
not
a
sound
came
from
the
mass
tellmarch
examined
each
individual
corpse
and
every
man
was
riddled
with
shot
their
executioners
doubtless
in
haste
to
depart
had
not
taken
time
to
bury
them
just
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
place
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
sight
of
four
feet
protruding
beyond
the
corner
of
a
low
wall
in
the
yard
these
feet
were
smaller
than
those
which
he
had
previously
seen
there
were
shoes
upon
them
and
as
he
drew
near
he
perceived
that
they
were
the
feet
of
women
two
women
were
lying
side
by
side
behind
the
wall
also
shot
tellmarch
stooped
over
them
one
of
them
wore
a
kind
of
uniform
beside
her
was
a
jug
broken
and
empty
she
was
a
vivandière
she
had
four
balls
in
her
head
she
was
dead
illustration
tellmarch
examined
the
other
who
was
a
peasant
woman
her
eyes
were
closed
her
mouth
open
her
face
discolored
but
there
were
no
wounds
in
her
head
her
dress
undoubtedly
worn
to
shreds
by
long
marches
was
rent
by
her
fall
exposing
her
bosom
tellmarch
pushed
it
still
further
aside
and
discovered
on
her
shoulder
a
round
wound
made
by
a
ball
the
was
broken
he
gazed
upon
her
livid
breast
a
nursing
mother
he
murmured
he
touched
her
she
was
not
cold
the
broken
bone
and
the
wound
in
the
shoulder
were
her
only
injuries
he
placed
his
hand
on
her
breast
and
felt
a
faint
throb
she
was
not
dead
tellmarch
raised
himself
and
cried
out
in
a
terrible
voice
is
there
no
one
here
is
that
you
caimand
replied
a
voice
so
low
that
it
could
scarcely
be
heard
at
the
same
time
a
head
emerged
from
a
hole
in
the
ruin
and
the
next
moment
a
second
one
peered
forth
from
another
aperture
these
were
the
sole
survivors
two
peasants
who
had
managed
to
hide
themselves
and
who
now
reassured
by
the
familiar
voice
of
the
caimand
crept
out
of
the
where
they
had
been
crouching
they
approached
tellmarch
still
trembling
violently
the
latter
had
found
strength
to
utter
his
cry
but
he
could
not
speak
deep
emotions
always
produce
this
effect
he
pointed
to
the
woman
lying
at
his
feet
is
she
still
alive
asked
one
of
the
peasants
tellmarch
nodded
and
the
other
woman
is
she
living
too
asked
the
second
peasant
tellmarch
shook
his
head
the
peasant
who
had
been
the
first
to
show
himself
continued

tellmarch
nodded
the
woods
were
near
the
farm
they
quickly
made
a
litter
with
branches
and
ferns
and
placing
the
woman
still
motionless
upon
it
they
started
towards
the
grove
the
two
peasants
bearing
the
litter
one
at
the
head
the
other
at
the
foot

tellmarch
supported
the
arm
and
constantly
felt
her
pulse

way
the
two
peasants
talked
and
over
the
body
of
the
bleeding
woman
whose
pale
face
was
lighted
by
the
moon
they
exchanged
their
frightened
exclamations
to
kill

by

every

had
to
watch

in

the
imposing
and
fierce
aspect
of
the
beginning
they
had
their
orators
like
varlot
for
instance
who
travelled
about
in

harangued

cimourdain
ii
cimourdain
illustration
cimourdain
had
a
pure
but
gloomy
soul
there
was
something
of
the
absolute
within
him
he
had
been
a
priest
which
is
a
serious
matter
a
man
may
like
the
heavens
enjoy
a
gloomy
serenity
it
needs
only
an
influence
powerful
enough
to
create
night
within
his
soul
and
the
priesthood
had
done
this
thing
for
cimourdain
to
be
once
a
priest
is
to
be
a
priest
forever
though
there
be
night
within
us
we
may
still
possess
the
stars
cimourdain
was
a
man
of
many
virtues
and
truths
but
they
shone
amid
the
darkness
his
story
may
be
told
in
a
few
words
he
had
been
a
village
curate
and
tutor
in
an
influential
family
but
falling
heir
to
a
small
legacy
he
had
thereby
gained
his
freedom
he
was
obstinate
to
the
last
degree
he
employed
meditation
as
the
artisan
uses
his
pincers
he
believed
it
wrong
to
abandon
an
idea
until
he
had
fully
developed
it
his
method
of
thought
was
intense
he
was
familiar
with
all
the
european
languages
and
had
some
acquaintance
with
other
tongues
his
devotion
to
study
was
a
great
help
towards
the
preservation
of
his
chastity
but
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
such
a
system
of
repression
either
from
pride
circumstances
or
loftiness
of
soul
he
had
been
true
to
his
priestly
vows
but
his
faith
he
had
not
been
able
to
keep
science
had
crushed
it
all
his
dogmas
had
gone
from
him
then
looking
into
his
own
soul
he
saw
therein
a
mutilated
being
and
having
no
power
to
rid
himself
of
his
priesthood
he
tried
after
an
austere
fashion
to
remould
the
man
for
want
of
a
family
he
adopted
his
country
a
wife
had
been
refused
him
he
had
wedded
humanity
there
is
a
certain
sense
of
emptiness
in
this
zeal
his
parents
who
were
peasants
had
thought
to
lift
him
above
the
common
people
by
consecrating
him
to
the
priesthood
he
had
returned
among
them
of
his
own
accord
and
with
a
feeling
of
passionate
devotion
watched
the
suffering
with
intense
sympathy
from
a
priest
he
had
become
a
philosopher
and
from
a
philosopher
an
athlete
even
during
the
life
of
louis
cimourdain
had
vaguely
fancied
himself
a
republican
but
of
what
republic
perhaps
of
the
republic
of
plato
and
it
might
be
of
draco
also
forbidden
to
love
he
devoted
himself
to
hating
he
detested
lies
monarchy
theocracy
and
his
priestly
garb
he
hated
the
present
and
eagerly
invoked
the
future
he
had
a
presentiment
of
what
it
would
be
he
foresaw
it
he
pictured
it
both
terrible
and
grand
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
this
deplorable
human
misery
he
felt
the
need
of
a
leader
who
would
appear
not
only
as
an
avenger
but
also
as
a
liberator
he
worshipped
the
catastrophe
from
afar
in
this
catastrophe
came
and
found
him
ready
cimourdain
flung
himself
into
that
gigantic
scheme
for
human
regeneration
on
logical
principles
which
for
a
mind
constituted
like
his
is
equivalent
to
saying
with
inexorable
determination
logic
is
not
a
softening
influence
he
had
survived
the
great
revolutionary
years
and
had
been
shaken
by
the
blasts
thereof
in
the
fall
of
the
bastille
the
end
of
the
martyrdom
of
people
in
on
the
of
june
the
end
of
the
feudal
system
in
varennes
and
the
end
of
royalty
in
the
birth
of
the
republic
he
had
seen
the
rise
of
revolution
he
was
not
the
man
to
fear
that
giant
on
the
contrary
the
universal
growth
had
given
him
new
life
and
though
already
advanced
in
years
for
he
was
fifty
and
a
priest
ages
faster
than
other
men
he
too
began
to
develop
from
year
to
year
he
had
watched
and
kept
pace
with
the
progress
of
events
at
first
he
had
feared
lest
revolution
might
fail
he
watched
it
since
it
had
both
logic
and
justice
on
its
side
he
expected
its
success
and
his
confidence
increased
in
proportion
to
the
fear
it
inspired
he
would
have
this
minerva
crowned
with
the
stars
of
the
future
a
pallas
likewise
bearing
the
gorgon
head
for
her
buckler
in
case
of
need
he
would
have
wished
an
infernal
glare
to
flash
from
her
divine
eyes
upon
the
demons
paying
them
back
in
their
own
coin
thus
he
reached
is
the
war
of
europe
against
france
and
of
france
against
paris
what
then
is
revolution
it
is
the
victory
of
france
over
europe
and
of
paris
over
france
hence
the
immensity
of
that
terrible
moment
grander
than
all
the
rest
of
the
century
nothing
could
be
more
tragic
europe
attacking
france
and
france
attacking
paris
a
drama
with
the
proportions
of
an
epic
is
a
year
of
intense
action
the
tempest
is
there
in
all
its
wrath
and
grandeur
cimourdain
felt
himself
in
his
element
this
scene
of
distraction
wild
and
magnificent
suited
the
compass
of
his
outspread
wings
like
a
he
united
a
profound
inward
calm
with
a
relish
for
external
danger
certain
winged
natures
souls
of
the
tempest
ferocious
yet
tranquil
seem
eminently
fitted
for
combatting
the
storms
of
life
his
sense
of
pity
was
never
kindled
save
in
behalf
of
the
wretched
he
devoted
himself
to
those
forms
of
suffering
that
are
most
repulsive
for
him
nothing
was
abhorrent
that
was
his
kind
of
goodness
he
was
divine
in
his
zeal
to
relieve
the
most
loathsome
sufferers
he
searched
for
ulcers
that
he
might
kiss
them
those
noble
actions
which
are
hideous
to
look
upon
are
the
most
difficult
to
perform
for
such
he
had
a
preference
one
day
at
the
a
man
was
at
the
point
of
death
suffocating
with
a
tumor
in
the
throat
a
putrid
malignant
and
perhaps
contagious
abscess
which
must
be
opened
at
once
cimourdain
was
there
he
put
his
lips
to
the
abscess
sucked
it
spitting
it
out
as
his
mouth
filled
emptied
the
tumor
and
saved
the
man
as
he
still
was
wearing
his
priestly
garb
at
the
time
some
one
said
to
him
had
you
done
that
for
the
king
you
would
be
made
a
bishop
i
would
not
do
it
for
the
king
replied
cimourdain
the
act
and
the
answer
made
him
popular
in
the
gloomy
quarters
of
paris
to
a
degree
that
won
for
him
unbounded
influence
over
the
classes
that
suffer
weep
and
struggle
for
vengeance
when
the
public
indignation
that
fruitful
source
of
blunders
rose
high
against
the
monopolists
it
was
cimourdain
who
by
a
word
prevented
the
sacking
of
a
boat
laden
with
soap
at
the
quay
and
who
dispersed
the
furious
crowds
that
were
stopping
the
carriages
at

barrier

it
was

ten
days
after
the
of

marshalled

with

round

round

was
rotting
alive
in

bidding

prophesied
to
him

would
fall

warrant
and
that
nothing
would
be
left
of
this
monarch
of
clay
save
his
brazen
arm
cimourdain
was
one
of
those
men
who
possess
an
inward
monitor
and
who
when
they
appear
are
simply
listening
to
its
voice
cimourdain
was
both
learned
and
ignorant
he
was
versed
in
science
and
knew
nothing
whatever
of
life
hence
his
severity
his
eyes
were
bandaged
like
those
of
homer
themis
he
possessed
the
blind
certainty
of
an
arrow
that
seeing
naught
besides
flies
straight
to
the
goal
in
revolution
there
is
nothing
so
formidable
as
the
straight
line
cimourdain
went
straight
ahead
with
fatal
results
he
believed
that
in
these
social
geneses
the
farthest
point
is
solid
ground
an
error
common
to
minds
in
which
logic
occupies
the
place
of
reason
he
went
beyond
the
convention
beyond
the
commune
he
belonged
to
the
évêché
the
society
called
the
évêché
because
it
held
its
meetings
in
a
hall
of
the
old
episcopal
palace
was
rather
a
medley
of
men
than
a
society
there
were
present
as
in
the
commune
those
silent
but
important
spectators
who
as
garat
expressed
it
had
about
them
as
many
pistols
as
they
had
pockets
the
évêché
was
a
queer
mixture
both
cosmopolitan
and
parisian
no
contradiction
in
terms
since
paris
is
the
place
where
throbs
the
heart
of
all
nations
there
at
the
évêché
was
the
great
plebeian
incandescence
as
compared
with
the
évêché
the
convention
was
cold
and
the
commune
lukewarm
it
was
one
of
those
revolutionary
formations
which
partake
of
the
nature
of
a
volcano
the
évêché
combined
everything
ignorance
stupidity
honesty
heroism
wrath
and
policy
brunswick
had
agents
therein
it
held
men
worthy
of
sparta
and
others
fit
only
for
the
galleys
the
greater
number
of
them
were
mad
and
honest
the
gironde
speaking
in
the
person
of
isnard
temporary
president
of
the
convention
had
uttered
this
appalling
prophecy
parisians
beware
for
in
your
city
not
one
stone
shall
be
left
resting
upon
another
and
the
day
will
come
when
men
will
search
for
the
place
where
paris
once
stood
this
speech
had
given
birth
to
the
évêché
certain
men
and
as
we
have
just
said
men
of
all
nations
had
felt
the
need
of
drawing
closer
to
paris
cimourdain
joined
this
group
the
party
reacted
against
the
reactionists
it
sprang
from
that
public
necessity
for
violence
which
constitutes
the
formidable
and
mysterious
side
of
revolutions
strong
in
this
strength
the
évêché
at
once
defined
its
position
in
the
disturbances
of
paris
it
was
the
commune
that
fired
the
cannon
and
the
évêché
that
sounded
the
alarm
in
his
inexorable
sincerity
cimourdain
believed
that
all
means
are
fair
when
devoted
to
the
service
of
truth
a
conviction
which
eminently
fitted
him
for
the
control
of
extremists
of
all
parties
scoundrels
perceived
him
to
be
honest
and
were
satisfied
crime
is
flattered
to
feel
that
virtue
has
taken
it
in
charge
it
is
rather
embarrassing
but
pleasing
nevertheless
palloy
the
architect
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
destruction
of
the
bastille
to
sell
the
stones
for
his
own
benefit
and
who
being
appointed
to
paint
the
cell
of

had
in
his
zeal
covered
the
wall
with
bars
chains
and
iron
collars
gonchon
the
suspected
orator
of
the
faubourg
whose
receipts
were
found
later
the
american
fournier
who
on
the
of
july
fired
a
at
lafayette
an
act
for
which
they
said
lafayette
himself
had
paid
henriot
who
had
come
from
bicêtre
and
who
had
been
a
lackey
a
juggler
a
thief
and
a
spy
before
he
turned
general
and
levelled
his
guns
on
the
convention
la
reynie
formerly
of
chartres
who
had
substituted
père
duchesne
for
his
breviary
all
these
men
were
respected
by
cimourdain
and
all
that
was
needed
to
keep
the
worst
of
them
from
stumbling
occasionally
was
to
feel
that
really
formidable
and
determined
candor
like
a
judgment
before
them
it
was
thus
that
terrified
schneider
at
the
same
time
the
majority
in
the
évêché
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
poor
and
violent
men
sincere
in
their
purposes
believed
in
cimourdain
and
followed
him
his
vicar
or
whichever
you
choose
to
call
him
was
danjou
that
other
republican
priest
whose
lofty
stature
endeared
him
to
the
people
who
called
him
the
abbé
cimourdain
could
have
led
whithersoever
he
chose
that
fearless
chief
called
général
la
pique
and
the
bold
truchon
surnamed
who
tried
to
save
madame
de
lamballe
offering
her
his
arm
to
assist
her
in
leaping
over
the
corpses
an
attempt
which
would
have
proved
successful
had
it
not
been
for
the
barbarous
joke
of
chariot
the
barber
the
commune
kept
watch
over
the
convention
and
the
évêché
over
the
commune
cimourdain
an
upright
man
despising
intrigues
had
broken
more
than
one
mysterious
thread
in
the
hands
of
pache
whom
beurnonville
called
the
black
man
at
the
évêché
cimourdain
was
on
good
terms
with
all
he
was
consulted
by
dobsent
and
momoro
he
spoke
spanish
to
gusman
italian
to
pio
english
to
arthur
flemish
to
pereyra
german
to
the
austrian
proly
the
bastard
of
a
prince
he
reconciled
all
these
discordant
elements
hence
his
strong
though
obscure
position
hébert
feared
him
in
those
times
and
over
those
tragic
assemblies
cimourdain
possessed
the
power
of
the
inexorable
he
was
a
faultless
man
who
believed
himself
to
be
infallible
he
had
never
been
seen
to
weep
his
was
an
inaccessible
and
frigid
virtue
a
just
but
awful
man
there
are
no
half
measures
possible
for
a
revolutionary
priest
a
priest
who
embarks
in
an
adventure
so
portentous
in
its
aims
is
influenced
either
by
the
highest
or
the
lowest
motives
he
must
be
either
infamous
or
sublime
cimourdain
was
sublime
but
isolated
in
rugged
inaccessibility
inhospitably
repellent
sublime
in
his
surrounding
of
precipices
lofty
mountains
possess
this
forbidding
purity
cimourdain
looked
like
an
ordinary
man
clothed
in
whatever
happened
to
be
convenient
rather
poor
in
aspect
in
his
youth
he
had
received
the
tonsure
and
later
in
life
had
become
bald
his
few
remaining
locks
were
gray
looking
upon
his
forehead
expansive
as
it
was
an
observing
eye
could
read
his
character
cimourdain
had
an
abrupt
way
of
speaking
at
once
passionate
and
solemn
his
utterance
was
rapid
his
tone
peremptory
the
expression
of
his
mouth
sad
and
bitter
his
eyes
were
clear
and
deep
and
his
whole
face
bore
the
impress
of
an
unspeakable
indignation
such
was
cimourdain
his
name
is
unknown
history
possesses
these
terrible
incognitos
iii
a
corner
not
dipped
into
the
styx
was
such
a
man
in
very
deed
a
man
could
the
servant
of
all
men
feel
a
personal
affection
was
he
not
too
much
of
a
soul
to
possess
a
heart
that
vast
embrace
enfolding
everything
and
everybody
could
it
be
limited
to
one
could
cimourdain
love
we
answer
yes
in
his
youth
when
he
was
a
tutor
in
an
almost
princely
family
he
had
a
pupil
the
son
and
heir
of
the
house
whom
he
loved
it
is
easy
to
love
a
child
what
is
there
that
one
can
not
forgive
a
child
one
forgives
him
for
being
a
lord
a
prince
a
king
his
innocent
age
and
his
weakness
make
one
forget
the
crimes
of
his
race
and
the
arrogance
of
his
rank
he
is
so
little
that
one
pardons
him
for
being
great
the
slave
forgives
him
for
being
the
master
the
old
negro
idolizes
the
white
nursling
cimourdain
had
conceived
a
passionate
love
for
his
pupil
childhood
is
so
ineffably
charming
it
absorbs
all
love
all
the
power
of
loving
in
cimourdain
nature
had
so
to
speak
concentrated
itself
upon
that
child
the
heart
condemned
to
solitude
fed
upon
this
sweet
and
innocent
creature
which
it
loved
with
the
combined
tenderness
of
a
father
a
brother
a
friend
and
a
creator
to
him
he
was
indeed
a
son
not
of
the
flesh
but
of
the
soul
he
was
not
his
father
the
author
of
his
being
but
he
was
his
master
and
this
was
his
masterpiece
he
had
made
a
man
of
this
little
lord
possibly
a
great
man
who
knows
thus
run
our
dreams
without
the
knowledge
of
the
family
for
does
one
require
permission
to
create
an
intelligence
a
will
and
an
upright
character
he
had
communicated
to
the
young
viscount
his
pupil
all
the
advanced
ideas
that
he
himself
held
he
had
inoculated
him
with
the
dread
virus
of
his
own
virtue
he
had
infused
into
his
veins
his
belief
his
conscience
his
ideal
into
the
brain
of
this
aristocrat
as
into
a
mould
he
had
poured
the
soul
of
the
people
mind
seeks
nourishment
intelligence
is
a
breast
there
is
an
analogy
between
the
nurse
who
gives
her
milk
and
the
tutor
who
gives
his
thought
sometimes
the
tutor
is
more
of
a
father
than
the
actual
father
himself
just
as
the
nurse
is
more
like
a
mother
than
the
natural
mother
cimourdain
was
closely
bound
to
his
pupil
by
the
profound
paternity
of
the
soul
the
very
sight
of
the
child
touched
him
let
us
add
this
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
replace
the
father
since
the
child
had
none
he
was
an
orphan
his
father
and
mother
were
both
dead
there
was
only
a
blind
grandmother
and
a
who
did
not
live
at
home
to
watch
over
him
the
grandmother
died
the
who
was
the
head
of
the
family
was
a
military
man
a
member
of
the
high
nobility
who
held
various
appointments
at
court
he
avoided
the
old
family
dungeon
living
at
versailles
changing
his
quarters
with
the
army
and
leaving
the
orphan
alone
in
the
solitary
castle
thus
the
preceptor
was
the
master
in
every
sense
of
the
word
furthermore
let
us
add
cimourdain
had
witnessed
the
birth
of
his
pupil
when
almost
a
baby
the
child
had
a
serious
illness
during
the
crisis
cimourdain
had
watched
over
him
night
and
day
the
doctor
prescribes
but
it
is
the
nurse
who
saves
and
cimourdain
had
saved
the
child
not
only
was
his
pupil
indebted
to
him
for
his
instruction
his
education
and
his
knowledge
he
also
owed
him
his
convalescence
and
his
health
over
and
above
the
development
of
his
mind
he
owed
him
his
very
life
we
worship
those
who
are
indebted
to
us
for
everything
hence
cimourdain
worshipped
the
child
in
the
course
of
time
the
natural
separation
between
them
took
place
having
finished
his
education
cimourdain
was
obliged
to
leave
the
child
who
had
now
become
a
young
man
with
what
cold
and
careless
cruelty
such
separations
are
planned
how
calmly
do
families
discharge
the
tutor
who
leaves
his
soul
behind
him
with
the
child
and
the
nurse
who
leaves
her
heart
blood
cimourdain
having
received
his
salary
and
his
dismissal
had
left
the
higher
for
the
lower
sphere
the
partition
that
separates
the
great
from
the
little
had
closed
once
more
the
young
lord
an
officer
by
birth
received
a
commission
at
the
outset
and
had
departed
to
join
some
garrison
the
humble
tutor
already
a
rebellious
priest
in
his
secret
heart
had
lost
no
time
in
returning
to
the
obscure
of
the
church
among
the
inferior
clergy
and
thus
lost
sight
of
his
pupil
revolution
came
the
recollection
still
brooding
within
him
of
that
creature
whom
he
had
transformed
into
a
man
was
by
no
means
lost
although
buried
beneath
the
immense
accumulation
of
public
affairs
it
is
a
noble
deed
to
model
a
statue
and
breathe
into
it
the
breath
of
life
but
to
mould
an
intelligence
and
inspire
it
with
the
spirit
of
truth
is
far
nobler
cimourdain
was
the
pygmalion
of
a
soul
the
mind
may
possess
its
offspring
the
only
being
on
earth
whom
he
loved
was
this
pupil
child
and
orphan
as
he
was
is
such
a
man
vulnerable
to
the
influence
of
any
affection
whatsoever

so
closely

not

during

night
when
after
having
placed

in

in

he
stopped
his
carriage
on
the
to
listen
to
the
tocsin
on
the
of
june
in
this
three
men
were
gathered
around
a
table
their
chairs
did
not
touch
each
man
occupied
one
of
the
three
sides
of
the
table
leaving
the
fourth
one
vacant
it
was
about
eight
in
the
evening
although
it
was
still
light
in
the
street
the
was
dark
and
a
lamp
a
luxury
in
those
times
hanging
from
the
ceiling
threw
its
light
upon
the
table
the
first
of
those
men
was
pale
young
and
grave
with
thin
lips
and
a
cold
unsympathetic
expression
there
was
a
nervous
twitching
in
his
cheek
which
must
have
been
a
drawback
to
the
act
of
smiling
he
was
powdered
and
gloved
and
his
and
coat
fitted
him
without
a
wrinkle
he
wore
nankeen
breeches
white
stockings
a
high
cravat
a
plaited
and
silver
buckles
on
his
shoes
of
the
two
other
men
one
was
so
to
speak
a
giant
the
other
a
dwarf
the
tall
man
was
negligently
dressed
in
a
loose
coat
of
scarlet
with
his
neck
bare
and
a
cravat
hanging
carelessly
below
his
his
waistcoat
was
unfastened
for
want
of
buttons
he
wore
and
his
hair
although
dishevelled
and
bristling
still
showed
signs
of
former
dressing
his
wig
looked
very
much
like
a
mane
and
his
face
was
marked
by
the
between
his
eyebrows
was
a
line
betokening
a
fierce
temper
and
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
another
rather
suggestive
of
a
kindly
nature
his
lips
were
thick
his
teeth
large
he
had
the
fist
of
a
porter
and
flashing
eyes
the
short
personage
was
a
man
who
when
seated
had
the
effect
of
one
deformed
his
head
was
thrown
back
his
eyes
livid
patches
covered
his
face
a
handkerchief
was
tied
over
his
straight
greasy
hair
no
forehead
to
speak
of
but
a
monstrous
and
terrible
mouth
he
wore
long
trousers
slippers
a
waistcoat
that
seemed
originally
to
have
been
made
of
white
satin
and
over
it
a
loose
jacket
in
the
folds
of
which
a
hard
straight
line
revealed
the
presence
of
a
poniard
the
first
of
these
men
was
robespierre
the
second
danton
the

were

pint
of

a
cup
of

before

near

stood

of

round
heavy
ridged
leaden
inkstands
which
will
be
remembered
by
all
who
were
schoolboys
at
the
beginning
of

century

a
pen
had
been
thrown
down
beside
it
a
large
brass
seal
bearing
the
words

representing

brought
by
his
master
to
the
café
of
the
rue
du
paon
he
was
ordered
to
keep
the
room
closed
where
marat
danton
and
robespierre
were
seated
and
to
admit
no
one
unless
it
were
some
person
from
the
committee
of
public
safety
the
commune
or
the
évêché
robespierre
would
not
have
it
closed
against
neither
would
danton
refuse
admittance
to
pache
or
marat
to
gusman
the
subject
of
the
conference
which
had
already
lasted
a
long
time
lay
in
the
papers
spread
out
on
the
table
which
robespierre
had
been
reading
aloud
the
voices
were
gradually
rising
higher
and
higher
something
very
like
anger
was
developing
between
these
three
men
from
without
one
could
catch
from
time
to
time
fragments
of
excited
speech
in
those
days
the
custom
of
public
tribunals
seemed
to
have
created
a
certain
right
to
listen
it
was
at
the
time
when
the
copying
clerk
fabricius
pâris
watched
through
the
the
proceedings
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
not
an
act
of
supererogation
be
it
observed
for
it
was
this
very
pâris
who
notified
danton
on
the
night
of
the
of
march
laurent
basse
had
his
ear
at
the
door
of
the
in
which
danton
marat
and
robespierre
were
seated
he
served
marat
but
he
belonged
to
the
évêché
ii
magna

voce
per
umbras
danton
had
just
risen
pushing
back
his
chair
impetuously
listen
he
cried
there
is
but
one
urgent
business
the
republic
is
in
danger
i
have
but
a
single
purpose
that
is
to
deliver
france
from
the
enemy
and
to
accomplish
this
all
means
are
fair
all
all
all
i
have
to
deal
with
every
form
of
danger
i
employ
every
variety
of
expedient
and
when
all
is
to
be
feared
then
i
venture
all
my
thought
is
a
lioness
no
half
measures
no
squeamishness
in
revolution
nemesis
is
not
a
haughty
prude
let
us
make
ourselves
terrible
and
likewise
useful
does
the
elephant
stop
to
see
where
he
puts
his
foot
let
us
crush
the
enemy
robespierre
replied
mildly
i
am
willing
then
he
added
the
question
is
to
learn
the
whereabouts
of
the
enemy
he
is
without
and
it
is
i
who
have
driven
him
there
said
danton
he
is
within
and
i
am
watching
him
said
robespierre
i
will
drive
him
out
again
replied
danton
one
can
not
so
easily
expel
an
internal
enemy
what
then
is
to
be
done
he
must
be
exterminated
i
agree
to
that
said
danton
in
his
turn
and
he
continued
but
i
tell
you
he
is
outside
robespierre
and
i
tell
you
that
he
is
within
danton
robespierre
he
is
on
the
frontier
he
is
in
the
vendée
danton
calm
yourselves
remarked
a
third
voice
he
is
everywhere
and
you
are
lost
it
was
marat
who
spoke
robespierre
looked
at
marat
and
quietly
retorted
a
truce
to
generalizations
let
us
come
to
particulars
here
are
the
facts
pedant
growled
marat
placing
his
hand
on
the
paper
spread
out
before
him
robespierre
continued
i
have
just
read
you
the
despatches
of
prieur
de
la
marne
and
also
communicated
the
information
given
by
gélambre
listen
danton
foreign
war
is
as
nothing
compared
with
the
dangers
of
civil
war
a
foreign
war
is
like
a
scratch
on
the
elbow
but
civil
war
is
an
ulcer
which
eats
away
your
liver
here
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
all
that
i
have
just
read
to
you
the
vendée
which
has
hitherto
been
divided
among
many
chiefs
is
about
to
concentrate
its
forces
henceforth
it
is
to
have
one
leader
a
sort
of
central
brigand
muttered
danton
it
is
the
man
who
landed
near
pontorson
on
the
of
june
you
have
seen
what
he
is
observe
that
this
landing
was
contemporary
with
the
arrest
of
the
representatives
prieur
de
la
côte
and
romme
at
bayeux
by
that
treacherous
district
of
calvados
which
took
place
on
the
very
same
day
the
of
june
and
their
transfer
to
the
castle
of
caen
said
danton
robespierre
replied
i
will
proceed
to
sum
up
the
despatches
they
are
organizing
the
warfare
of
the
forest
on
a
vast
scale
at
the
same
time
an
english
invasion
is
in
preparation
vendeans
and
englishmen
brittany
joining
hands
with
britain
the
hurons
of
finistère
speak
the
same
language
as
the
topinambes
of
cornwall
i
showed
you
an
intercepted
letter
of
puisaye
where
he
says
that
thousand
red
coats
distributed
among
the
insurgents
will
be
the
means
of
raising
one
hundred
thousand
more
when
the
peasant
insurrection
is
fully
organized
the
english
descent
will
take
place
here
is
the
plan
follow
it
on
the
map
and
putting
his
finger
on
the
map
robespierre
continued
the
english
have
the
choice
of
landing
place
from
cancale
to
paimpol
craig
would
prefer
the
bay
of
cornwallis
the
bay
of
but
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
detail
the
left
shore
of
the
loire
is
guarded
by
the
rebel
vendean
army
and
as
to
the
miles
of
open
country
between
ancenis
and
pontorson
forty
norman
parishes
have
promised
their
assistance
the
descent
will
be
made
at
three
points
plérin
iffiniac
and
pléneuf
from
plérin
they
will
go
to
and
from
pléneuf
to
lamballe
on
the
second
day
they
intend
to
reach
dinan
where
there
are
nine
hundred
english
prisoners
thus
simultaneously
occupying
and
where
they
are
to
leave
the
cavalry
on
the
third
day
two
columns
will
march
one
to
jouan
on
bédée
the
other
to
dinan
on
becherel
a
natural
fortress
and
where
they
propose
to
set
up
two
batteries
on
the
fourth
day
they
expect
to
be
at
rennes
which
is
the
key
to
brittany
whoever
has
rennes
is
master
of
the
situation
rennes
once
taken
châteauneuf
and
are
sure
to
fall
there
are
one
million
cartridges
and
fifty
at
rennes
which
they
will
sweep
away
muttered
danton
robespierre
continued
to
conclude
from
rennes
three
columns
will
descend
one
upon
fougères
and
the
second
and
third
upon
vitré
and
redon
as
the
bridges
are
destroyed
the
enemy
will
be
provided
as
has
already
been
stated
with
pontoons
and
planks
and
they
will
also
have
guides
for
such
places
as
are
fordable
by
cavalry
from
fougères
they
will
diverge
to
avranches
from
redon
to
ancenis
from
vitré
to
laval
nantes
will
surrender
brest
likewise
redon
opens
the
way
to
vilaine
as
fougères
to
normandy
and
vitré
to
paris
in
fifteen
days
they
will
have
a
brigand
army
of
three
hundred
thousand
men
and
the
whole
of
brittany
will
belong
to
the
king
of
france
you
mean
to
the
king
of
england
said
danton
no
to
the
king
of
france
replied
robespierre
adding
the
king
of
france
is
worse
it
takes
fifteen
days
to
expel
a
foreign
foe
and
eighteen
hundred
years
to
destroy
a
monarchy
danton
who
had
reseated
himself
with
his
elbows
resting
on
the
table
supported
hip
head
on
his
hands
and
remained
buried
in
thought
you
perceive
the
danger
said
robespierre
vitré
opens
for
the
english
the
way
to
paris
raising
his
head
danton
brought
his
two
clenched
fists
down
upon
the
map
as
though
it
were
an
anvil
robespierre
did
not
verdun
open
the
way
to
paris
for
the
prussians
what
then
well
we
will
drive
the
english
as
we
drove
the
prussians
and
danton
rose
again
robespierre
placed
his
cold
hand
on
danton
burning
wrist
danton
champagne
did
not
take
sides
with
the
prussians
as
brittany
does
with
the
english
retaking
verdun
was
foreign
war
but
to
recapture
vitré
will
be
civil
war
and
robespierre
murmured
in
a
cold
sepulchral
tone
a
serious
difference
then
he
continued
sit
down
danton
and
look
at
the
map
instead
of
battering
it
with
your
fists
but
danton
was
wholly
carried
away
with
his
own
ideas
well
this
goes
beyond
everything
he
exclaimed
to
be
on
the
alert
for
a
catastrophe
in
the
west
when
it
is
actually
in
the
east
i
grant
you

that
england
looms
up
on
the

but
spain
rises
from

italy
from

germany
from

the

danton

danton

yours
robespierre

i
will
also
mention
a
few
facts
you
do
not
see
the
real
danger
which
is
centred
in

a
perpetual
racket

at

buzzing
all
this
is
a
serious
matter

danton
no
longer
laughed

what
the

neither

you
need
a

and
some
one
to
dot
your
for
you
this
is
the
meaning

what
i
told
you
you
are
both
mistaken
the
danger
comes
neither
from
london
nor
from
berlin
as
you
two
believe
it
is
in

it
is
in
the
absence

unity
in
the
right
of
every

with
you
yourselves

anarchy

is
it

not
yourself

to
pick
it
up
the
danger
comes
from
the
and
the
monopolists
fine
progress
we
have
made
when
we
hoist
the
black
flag
over
the
hôtel
de
ville
you
have
arrested
baron
trenck
but
that
is
not
sufficient
i
want
to
see
you
wring
the
neck
of
that
old
prison
intriguer
do
you
think
that
the
business
is
accomplished
because
the
president
of
the
convention
places
a
civic
crown
on
the
head
of
labertèche
who
received
at
jemmapes
and
of
whom
chénier
makes
himself
the
showman
comedies
and
idle
shows
ah
you
take
no
heed
of
paris
you
are
looking
for
danger
at
a
distance
when
it
is
close
at
hand
of
what
use
are
your
police
robespierre
you
have
your
spies
payan
in
the
commune
coffinhal
at
the
revolutionary
tribunal
david
in
the
committee
of
public
safety
couthon
in
the
committee
of
public
you
perceive
that
i
am
well
informed
now
then
learn
this
the
danger
is
hanging
over
your
heads
and
rising
beneath
your
feet
conspiracies
conspiracies
conspiracies
the
people
passing
along
the
streets
read
the
papers
to
one
another
and
nod
their
heads
significantly
six
thousand
men
having
no
civic
papers
the
returned
émigrés
muscadins
and
mathevons
are
hidden
in
the
cellars
and
garrets
and
in
the
wooden
galleries
of
the
palais
royal
they
are
ranged
in
files
in
front
of
the
women
stand
on
the
and
clasping
their
hands
cry
shall
we
have
peace
it
is
of
no
use
to
close
the
doors
of
the
executive
committee
against
the
public
every
word
you
utter
is
known
and
as
a
proof
robespierre
i
will
repeat
the
words
you
spoke
last
night
to
paunch
grows
apace
that
will
inconvenience
him
in
his
flight
danger
i
tell
you
lurks
on
every
side
but
chiefly
in
the
centre
in
paris
while
the
are
weaving
their
plots
the
patriots
go
barefoot
the
aristocrats
arrested
on
the
of
march
are
already
released
the
fine
private
horses
that
bespatter
us
with
mud
in
the
streets
ought
to
be
harnessed
to
the
cannons
on
the
frontier
a
loaf
of
bread
weighing
four
pounds
is
sold
for
three
francs
and
twelve
sous
indecent
plays
are
given
on
the
stage
and
robespierre
will
sooner
or
later
send
danton
to
the
guillotine
phew
exclaimed
danton
robespierre
was
attentively
studying
the
map
what
we
need
is
a
dictator
cried
marat
fiercely
you
know
robespierre
that
i
want
a
dictator
robespierre
raised
his
head
yes
i
know
marat
it
must
be
either
you
or
i
i
or
you
you
mean
retorted
marat
the
dictatorship
i
advise
you
to
try
it
grumbled
danton
between
his
closed
teeth
marat
perceived
danton
frown
stop
he
said
let
us
make
one
last
effort
to
come
to
an
agreement
the
situation
is
well
worth
it
was
there
not
an
understanding
for
the
of
may
the
question
of
mutual
agreement
is
even
more
important
than
girondism
which
is
a
matter
of
detail
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
truth
in
your
statements
but
truth
itself
the
whole
truth
the
real
truth
lies
in
i
say
federalism
in
the
south
royalism
in
the
west
a
deadly
struggle
between
the
convention
and
the
commune
in
paris
and
on
the
frontier
the
backsliding
of
custine
and
the
treason
of
dumouriez
what
will
be
the
result
the
end
will
be
nothing
less
than
dismemberment
and
what
do
we
require
unity
therein
lies
our
salvation
but
we
have
no
time
to
lose
paris
must
undertake
the
control
of
the
revolution
if
we
waste
one
hour
the
vendeans
may
be
in
orleans
and
the
prussians
in
paris
i
grant
one
thing
to
you
danton
and
another
to
robespierre
so
be
it
and
the
conclusion
must
be
dictatorship
let
us
we
three
who
represent
the
revolution
grasp
the
dictatorship
we
are
the
three
heads
of
cerberus
one
is
a
talking
head
and
that
is
you
robespierre
the
second
head
does
the
roaring
and
that
is
you
danton
and
the
other
bites
and
that
is
you
marat
said
danton
all
three
bite
said
robespierre
for
a
time
there
was
silence
then
this
dialogue
full
of
gloomy
and
violent
utterances
proceeded
listen
marat
people
should
know
each
other
before
they
marry
how
did
you
find
out
what
i
said
to
yesterday
that
is
my
affair
robespierre
marat
it
is
my
duty
to
gain
information
marat
i
like
to
know
what
is
going
on
marat
robespierre
i
know
what
you
say
to
as
i
know
what
danton
says
to
lacroix
i
know
what
happens
on
the
quay
of
the
théatins
at
the
hôtel
labriffe
a
den
frequented
by
the
nymphs
of
the
emigration
as
well
as
i
know
what
is
going
on
at
the
house
of
thilles
near
gonesse
which
now
belongs
to
valmerange
the
former
administrator
of
the
postal
service
where
maury
and
cazalès
were
in
the
habit
of
going
a
house
which
sieyès
and
vergniaud
have
since
frequented
and
where
at
the
present
time
a
certain
person
goes
once
a
week
in
saying
a
certain
person
marat
looked
significantly
at
danton
if
i
had
but
two
farthings
worth
of
power
this
would
be
terrible
cried
danton
illustration
i
know
what
you
say
robespierre
continued
marat
just
as
i
knew
what
was
going
on
in
the
tower
of
the
temple
when
they
were
fattening
louis
xvi
and
the
wolf
the
and
the
cubs
during
the
month
of
september
alone
devoured
baskets
of
peaches
at
that
time
the
nation
was
starving
i
know
it
as
i
know
that
roland
was
concealed
in
a
lodging
looking
out
on
a
in
the
rue
de
la
harpe
as
i
know
that
six
hundred
pikes
used
on
the
of
july
were
manufactured
by
faure
the
locksmith
of
the
duke
of
orleans
as
i
know
what
they
do
at
the
house
of
the
mistress
of
sillery
on
the
days
when
there
is
to
be
a
ball
old
sillery
himself
chalks
the
parquet
floors
of
the
yellow
salon
in
the
rue
buzot
and
kersaint
dined
there
saladin
dined
there
on
the
and
with
whom
do
you
guess
robespierre
with
your
friend
lasource
idle
talk
muttered
robespierre
lasource
is
not
my
friend
he
added
thoughtfully
in
the
mean
time
there
are
eighteen
manufactories
of
false
assignats
in
london
marat
went
on
in
a
voice
calm
but
somewhat
tremulous
an
ominous
sign
with
him
you
are
the
faction
of
the
yes
i
know
everything
in
spite
of
what
calls
the
silence
of
state
marat
emphasized
this
word
looked
at
robespierre
and
continued
i
know
the
conversation
that
takes
place
at
your
table
on
the
days
when
lebas
invites
david
to
eat
the
food
prepared
by
his
betrothed
élisabeth
duplay
your
future
robespierre
i
am
the
eye
of
the
people
and
from
the
depths
of
my
cave
i
observe
yes
i
hear
i
see
and
i
know
you
are
contented
with
small
things
you
admire
yourself
robespierre
shows
himself
off
before
his
madame
de
chalabre
the
daughter
of
the
marquis
who
played
whist
with
louis
xv
on
the
evening
of
damiens
execution
yes
heads
are
carried
high
in
these
days
never
unbends
legendre
is
a
scrupulous
devotee
to
fashion
with
his
new
and
white
waistcoat
and
a
frill
that
people
may
forget
his
apron
robespierre
imagines
that
history
will
be
interested
to
know
that
he
wore
an
coat
la
and
a
coat
la
he
hangs
his
portrait
on
every
wall
around
his
room
robespierre
interrupted
him
in
a
voice
even
more
quiet
than
that
of
marat
himself
and
you
drag
yours
through
all
the
sewers
marat
they
continued
this
conversation
in
tones
whose
very
deliberation
emphasized
the
violence
of
the
attacks
and
retorts
and
added
a
certain
irony
to
the
implied
threats
robespierre
you
called
those
who
are
in
favor
of
the
abolition
of
monarchy
the
don
quixotes
of
mankind
and
you
marat
after
the
of
august
in
no
of
your
du
peuple
you
see
i
remember
the
number
a
useful
item
you
requested
to
have
the
titles
of
the
nobles
restored
to
them
you
said
a
duke
always
a
duke
robespierre
in
the
session
of
the
of
december
you
defended
roland
wife
against
viard
just
as
my
brother
defended
you
marat
when
you
were
attacked
at
the
jacobins
what
does
that
prove
nothing
at
all
robespierre
we
all
know
the
cabinet
at
the
tuileries
where
you
said
to
garas
am
tired
of
the
revolution
marat
in
this
very
on
the
of
october
you
embraced
barbaroux
and
you
said
to
buzot
robespierre
does
the
republic
signify
marat
you
invited
three
men
from
marseilles
to
breakfast
with
you
here
in
this
robespierre
you
go
about
escorted
by
a
strong
fellow
from
the
market
armed
with
a
club
and
you
marat
on
the
eve
of
the
of
august
you
asked
buzot
to
assist
you
in
escaping
to
marseilles
disguised
as
a
jockey
during
the
prosecutions
of
september
you
took
good
care
to
hide
yourself
robespierre
and
you
marat
were
not
backward
in
making
a
display
of
yourself
robespierre
you
flung
the
red
cap
on
the
ground
yes
when
a
traitor
hoisted
it
dumouriez
defiles
robespierre
robespierre
you
refused
to
throw
a
veil
over
the
head
of
louis
xvi
when
chateauvieux
soldiers
were
passing
i
did
better
than
veil
his
head
i
cut
it
off
danton
interposed
but
it
was
like
pouring
oil
upon
the
flames
robespierre
marat
calm
yourselves
he
said
marat
did
not
like
to
be
mentioned
in
the
second
place
he
turned
round
what
affair
is
this
of
danton
what
affair
of
mine
i
will
tell
you
there
must
be
no
fratricides
we
must
have
no
strife
between
two
men
both
of
whom
serve
the
people
it
is
enough
to
have
to
deal
with
foreign
and
civil
wars
and
it
would
be
too
much
if
we
were
to
have
a
family
conflict
it
is
i
who
made
the
revolution
and
i
do
not
choose
to
have
it
destroyed
this
is
why
i
feel
called
upon
to
interfere
marat
replied
without
raising
his
voice
you
had
better
be
attending
to
the
settlement
of
your
own
accounts
my
accounts
cried
danton
go
ask
for
them
in
the
passes
of
argonne
in
champagne
delivered
in
belgium
conquered
in
the
armies
where
i
have
exposed
my
breast
four
times
already
to
the
inquire
in
the
place
de
la
révolution
on
the
scaffold
of
the
of
january
of
the
throne
lying
on
the
ground
of
the
guillotine
that
widow
here
marat
broke
forth
interrupting
danton
the
guillotine
is
a
virgin
who
gives
death
unto
men
but
not
life
what
do
you
know
about
it
i
will
make
her
fruitful
we
shall
see
and
he
smiled
danton
saw
the
smile
marat
he
cried
you
are
the
man
who
prefers
to
hide
i
am
a
man
who
rejoices
in
broad
daylight
in
the
open
air
i
despise
the
life
of
a
reptile
it
would
not
suit
me
to
be
a
woodlouse
you
live
in
a
cave
i
live
in
the
street
you
hold
no
communication
with
mankind
the
chance
may
see
and
speak
with
me
handsome
youth
will
you
ascend
to
my
abode
growled
marat
and
no
longer
smiling
he
continued
in
a
peremptory
tone
danton
give
an
account
of
the
thousand
crowns
cash
that
were
paid
you
by
that
montmorin
in
the
name
of
the
king
under
the
pretext
of
indemnifying
you
for
the
post
of
solicitor
of
the
châtelet
i
belonged
to
the
of
july
said
danton
haughtily
and
the
and
the
crown
diamonds
i
was
also
of
the
of
october
and
the
thefts
of
your
lacroix
in
belgium
i
was
of
the
of
june
and
the
loans
to
montansier
i
influenced
the
people
to
bring
about
the
return
from
varennes
and
the
opera
house
built
with
the
money
that
you
furnished
i
armed
the
sections
of
paris
and
the
hundred
thousand
livres
in
secret
funds
of
the
ministère
de
la
justice
the
of
august
was
my
work
and
the
two
millions
secret
expenses
of
the
assembly
a
quarter
of
which
fell
to
your
share
i
arrested
the
progress
of
the
enemy
and
barred
the
road
to
the
allied
kings
prostitute
cried
marat
danton
was
terrible
in
his
wrath
yes
he
cried
you
have
spoken
the
word
i
have
sold
my
virtue
but
i
saved
the
world
robespierre
meanwhile
continued
to
bite
his
nails
he
could
neither
laugh
nor
smile
he
possessed
not
the
laughter
of
danton
nor
the
sting
of
marat
smile
danton
continued
i
am
like
the
ocean
i
have
my
flood
and
ebb
when
the
tide
is
low
you
can
see
the
shoals
but
at
high
tide
you
see
only
the
waves
what
one
might
call
your
froth
said
marat
my
tempest
rather
replied
danton
they
both
sprang
to
their
feet
and
marat
burst
forth
the
adder
suddenly
assumed
the
shape
of
a
dragon
ah
robespierre
ah
danton
he
exclaimed
you
will
not
listen
to
me
i
tell
you
you
are
lost
your
policy
brings
you
up
against
a
wall
every
issue
is
closed
to
you
and
you
go
on
committing
deeds
that
will
finally
leave
you
with
no
outlet
save
that
of
the
grave
in
that
lies
the
very
essence
of
our
greatness
said
danton
shrugging
his
shoulders
marat
went
on
danton
beware
vergniaud
has
a
wide
mouth
thick
lips
and
frowning
brows
like
yourself
he
is
also
pitted
like
you
and
mirabeau
yet
this
did
not
prevent
the
of
may
ah
you
shrug
your
shoulders
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
has
been
known
to
cost
a
man
his
head
i
tell
you
danton
your
loud
voice
your
loose
cravat
your
your
late
suppers
your
ample
pockets
louisette
will
have
something
to
say
about
all
that
louisette
was
marat
pet
name
for
the
guillotine
he
continued
and
as
for
you
robespierre
you
are
a
moderate
but
that
will
avail
you
nothing
go
on
powder
and
dress
your
hair
brush
your
clothes
play
the
coxcomb
wear
fine
linen
be
a
model
of
propriety
frizzed
and
bedizened
sooner
or
later
you
will
go
to
the
place
de
grève
read
brunswick
proclamation
and
make
up
your
mind
to
be
treated
like
the
regicide
damiens
and
you
are
arrayed
in
fine
style
to
be
drawn
and
quartered
echo
of
coblentz
muttered
robespierre
between
his
teeth
robespierre
i
echo
no
one
i
am
the
cry
of
the
whole
world
ah
you
are
young
both
of
you
how
old
are
you
danton
and
you
robespierre
well
as
for
myself
i
have
lived
from
the
beginning
of
time
i
am
the
embodiment
of
the
ancient
misery
of
mankind
i
am
six
thousand
years
old
that
is
true
replied
danton
for
six
thousand
years
cain
has
been
preserved
in
hatred
like
a
toad
in
a
stone
the
stone
breaks
and
cain
leaps
forth
among
men
to
be
known
as
marat
danton
cried
marat
and
a
livid
glare
shone
in
his
eyes
well
what
is
it
said
danton
thus
conversed
these
three
terrible
men
conflicting
thunderbolts
iii
a
quivering
of
the
inmost
fibres
illustration
the
conversation
ceased
for
a
time
each
titan
betook
himself
to
his
own
reflections
lions
are
disturbed
by
hydras
robespierre
had
grown
very
pale
and
danton
very
much
flushed
both
shuddered
marat
wild
glare
had
died
out
calmness
imperious
calmness
now
rested
on
the
face
of
that
man
feared
by
those
who
were
themselves
objects
of
awe
danton
felt
himself
conquered
but
was
unwilling
to
yield
he
continued
marat
talks
loudly
of
dictatorship
and
unity
possessing
all
the
while
a
talent
for
destroying
robespierre
opened
his
thin
lips
and
by
way
of
supplementing
speech
remarked
i
agree
with
anacharsis
cloots
give
me
neither
roland
nor
marat
and
i
said
marat
i
say
neither
danton
nor
robespierre
he
gazed
steadily
at
the
two
men
and
then
added
let
me
advise
you
danton
you
are
in
love
and
think
of
marrying
again
let
politics
alone
be
wise
and
taking
a
step
towards
the
door
he
was
about
to
take
his
departure
with
the
ominous
salutation
farewell
gentlemen
danton
and
robespierre
shuddered
at
that
moment
a
voice
was
heard
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
saying
you
are
wrong
marat
all
turned
during
marat
outbreak
some
one
had
entered
unperceived
through
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
room
is
that
you
citizen
cimourdain
said
marat
it
was
cimourdain
i
tell
you
that
you
are
wrong
marat
he
repeated
marat
turned
green
which
was
his
way
of
growing
pale
and
cimourdain
added
you
are
useful
but
robespierre
and
danton
are
indispensable
why
do
you
threaten
them
let
us
have
union
citizens
the
people
wish
us
to
be
united
this
entrance
was
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
or
the
arrival
of
a
stranger
upon
the
scene
of
a
family
quarrel
it
produced
a
calming
effect
upon
the
surface
if
it
did
not
reach
the
depths
cimourdain
advanced
towards
the
table
both
danton
and
robespierre
knew
him
they
had
often
noticed
in
the
public
tribunals
of
the
convention
this
obscure
but
influential
man
whom
the
people
greeted
with
respect
robespierre
however
always
ceremonious
inquired
how
did
you
get
in
citizen
he
belongs
to
the
évêché
replied
marat
in
an
unusually
meek
tone
of
voice
marat
braved
the
convention
and
led
the
commune
but
he
feared
the
évêché
this
is
a
law
mirabeau
in
some
mysterious
depth
is
conscious
of
the
existence
of
robespierre
marat
too
is
aware
of
hébert
hébert
of
babeuf
so
long
as
the
subterranean
strata
remain
quiet
the
politician
can
move
at
his
ease
but
there
is
a
under
the
most
revolutionary
and
the
boldest
men
will
quail
when
they
feel
beneath
their
feet
the
movement
which
they
themselves
have
started
overhead
illustration
to
be
able
to
distinguish
between
the
disturbance
that
springs
from
covetousness
and
that
which
is
founded
on
principle
to
combat
the
one
and
to
aid
the
other
constitutes
the
genius
and
merit
of
great
revolutionists
oh
citizen
cimourdain
is
not
unwelcome
he
said
as
he
extended
his
hand
to
cimourdain
adding
parbleu
let
us
explain
the
situation
to
citizen
cimourdain
he
comes
in
just
in
time
i
represent
the
mountain
robespierre
the
committee
of
public
safety
marat
the
commune
and
cimourdain
represents
the
évêché
he
will
give
us
the
casting
vote
so
be
it
replied
cimourdain
in
his
serious
and
simple
manner
what
is
the
subject
under
consideration
the
vendée
replied
robespierre
the
vendée
echoed
cimourdain
then
went
on
there
lies
the
great
danger
if
revolution
expires
the
vendée
will
have
given
it
its
one
vendée
is
more
to
be
feared
than
ten
germanys
if
france
is
to
be
saved
we
must
destroy
the
vendée
these
words
won
robespierre
to
his
side
but
still
the
latter
put
the
question
were
you
not
formerly
a
priest
for
the
priestly
aspect
had
not
escaped
his
observation
he
recognized
in
another
what
he
had
within
himself
yes
citizen
replied
cimourdain
what
does
that
matter
cried
danton
when
priests
are
good
they
are
better
than
other
men
in
time
of
revolution
priests
are
melted
into
citizens
just
as
bells
are
melted
into
sous
and
cannon
danjou
and
danon
are
both
priests

the

motion
seconded

they

did
the
business
the
priest
overturned
the
throne
the
comedian
deposed
the
king
let
us
return
to
the
vendée
said
robespierre
well
what
is
it
asked
cimourdain
what
is
the
vendée
doing
now
this
replied
robespierre
it
has
found
a
leader
it
will
become
terrible
who
is
this
leader
citizen
robespierre
he
is
a
marquis
de
lantenac
who
styles
himself
a
breton
prince
cimourdain
made
a
movement
i
know
him
he
said
i
was
chaplain
at
his
house
he
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
he
was
fond
of
women
before
he
became
active
in
military
affairs
like
biron
who
was
a
lauzun
said
danton
cimourdain
added
thoughtfully
yes
formerly
a
man
devoted
to
pleasure
he
must
be
terrible
frightful
said
robespierre
he
burns
villages
kills
the
wounded
massacres
prisoners
and
shoots
women
women
yes
among
others
he
ordered
a
woman
to
be
shot
who
was
the
mother
of
three
children
no
one
knows
what
became
of
the
children
moreover
he
is
really
a
leader
he
understands
the
art
of
warfare
true
replied
cimourdain
when
he
was
in
the
hanoverian
war
the
soldiers
used
to
say
above
lantenac
below
but
the
latter
was
the
actual
general
ask
your
colleague
dussaulx
about
it
robespierre
remained
for
a
moment
absorbed
in
thought
then
the
conversation
between
cimourdain
and
himself
was
renewed
well
citizen
cimourdain
this
man
is
in
the
vendée
how
long
since
three
weeks
ago
he
must
be
outlawed
that
has
been
done
a
price
must
be
set
upon
his
head
that
also
has
been
done
a
large
sum
of
money
must
be
offered
for
his
capture
the
offer
has
been
made
it
must
not
be
in
assignats
certainly
not
but
in
gold
it
has
been
so
promised
and
he
must
be
guillotined
that
shall
be
done
by
whom
by
you
by
me
yes
you
will
be
delegated
by
the
committee
of
public
safety
with
ample
powers
i
accept
said
cimourdain
robespierre
was
rapid
in
his
decisions
a
quality
he
took
from
the
portfolio
that
lay
before
him
a
sheet
of
white
paper
at
the
head
of
which
the
following
words
were
printed
french
republic
one
and
indivisible
committee
of
public
safety
i
accept
continued
cimourdain
let
the
terrible
encounter
the
terrible
lantenac
is
ferocious
i
will
be
equally
so
it
shall
be
war
unto
death
with
that
man
i
shall
rid
the
republic
of
him
if
it
be
god
will
he
stopped
then
continued
i
am
a
priest
i
believe
in
god
god
has
grown
antiquated
said
danton
i
believe
in
god
repeated
cimourdain
unmoved
robespierre
gloomily
nodded
his
approval
and
cimourdain
continued
to
whom
shall
i
be
delegated
robespierre
replied
to
the
commandant
of
the
exploring
division
sent
against
lantenac
but
i
give
you
warning
that
he
is
a
nobleman
that
is
another
thing
that
excites
my
contempt
cried
danton
a
nobleman
well
what
of
that
it
is
all
the
same
whether
a
man
be
a
priest
or
a
nobleman
if
he
is
a
good
man
he
is
excellent
nobility
is
a
prejudice
but
we
ought
to
deal
impartially
with
it
granting
both
its
merits
and
its
demerits
is
not
a
nobleman
robespierre
florelle
de
parbleu
anacharsis
cloots
is
a
baron
our
friend
charles
hesse
who
never
misses
a
single
session
of
the
cordeliers
is
a
prince
brother
to
the
reigning
landgrave
of
montaut
marat
intimate
friend
is
marquis
de
montaut
in
the
revolutionary
tribunal
there
is
one
juror
vilate
who
is
a
priest
and
another
leroy
marquis
de
montflabert
both
are
trustworthy
men
and
you
forget
added
robespierre
the
foreman
of
the
revolutionary
jury
antonelle
marquis
antonelle
corrected
robespierre
and
that
dampierre
who
was
lately
killed
before
condé
by
the
republic
rejoined
danton
was
a
nobleman
and
beaurepaire
too
who
blew
his
brains
out
rather
than
open
the
gates
of
verdun
to
the
prussians
and
in
spite
of
all
that
grumbled
marat
on
the
day
when
condorcet
exclaimed
gracchi
were
nobles
danton
cried
out
nobles
are
traitors
beginning
with
mirabeau
and
ending
with
thee
here
the
serious
voice
of
cimourdain
rose
above
the
others
citizen
danton
citizen
robespierre
you
may
perhaps
be
justified
in
your
confidence
but
the
nation
distrusts
and
it
has
reason
to
do
so
when
a
priest
is
charged
with
the
surveillance
of
a
nobleman
the
responsibility
is
a
double
one
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
priest
to
be
inflexible
that
is
true
said
robespierre
and
inexorable
added
cimourdain
well
said
citizen
cimourdain
rejoined
robespierre
it
is
a
young
man
with
whom
you
will
have
to
deal
and
you
will
have
the
advantage
over
him
from
the
fact
that
you
are
twice
his
age
he
must
be
guided
but
with
the
utmost
discretion
that
he
may
not
suspect
it
it
seems
that
he
has
military
ability
all
reports
are
unanimous
on
that
point
he
forms
part
of
a
corps
which
has
been
detached
from
the
army
of
the
rhine
and
sent
into
the
vendée
he
has
lately
returned
from
the
frontier
where
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
bravery
and
intelligence
and
is
now
in
command
of
the
exploring
division
which
he
handles
like
an
expert
for
fifteen
days
he
has
held
the
old
marquis
de
lantenac
in
check
he
restrains
him
and
at
the
same
time
compels
him
to
give
way
he
will
end
by
forcing
him
to
the
sea
and
pitching
him
into
it
lantenac
has
the
cunning
of
an
old
general
while
his
opponent
possesses
the
boldness
of
a
young
captain
this
young
man
has
already
won
for
himself
enemies
and
detractors
who
are
envious
of
him
léchelle
is
jealous
of
him
this
léchelle
wants
to
be
interrupted
danton
he
has
only
a
pun
in
his
favor
it
needs
a
ladder
to
mount
into
a
cart
meanwhile
charette
defeats
him
and
he
is
not
willing
that
any
one
else
should
defeat
lantenac
added
robespierre
the
misfortune
of
the
vendean
war
is
the
existence
of
these
rivalries
our
soldiers
are
heroes
led
by
inferior
commanders
chérin
a
mere
captain
of
hussars
enters
saumur
with
trumpets
playing
he
takes
saumur
he
might
go
on
and
take
cholet
but
having
received
no
orders
he
pauses
every
position
of
command
in
the
vendée
ought
to
be
reconstructed
the
garrisons
are
scattered
the
forces
dispersed
an
army
that
is
scattered
is
paralyzed
it
is
like
a
rock
crumbling
into
dust
nothing
but
tents
are
left
at
camp
de
paramé
between
tréguier
and
dinan
there
are
a
hundred
useless
little
encampments
out
of
which
a
division
could
be
formed
to
cover
the
entire
coast
léchelle
supported
by
parrein
robs
the
northern
coast
under
the
pretext
of
protecting
the
southern
and
thus
exposes
france
to
the
english
half
a
million
of
peasants
in
revolt
and
a
descent
of
england
upon
france
such
is
lantenac
plan
the
young
commander
of
the
exploring
column
presses
his
resistless
sword
against
lantenac
loins
until
he
forces
him
to
yield
and
this
without
asking
leave
of
léchelle
now
léchelle
is
his
chief
therefore
he
denounces
him
opinions
are
divided
regarding
this
young
man
léchelle
would
like
to
have
him
shot
and
prieur
de
la
marne
wishes
to
make
him
he
seems
to
me
to
possess
great
qualities
observed
cimourdain
but
he
has
one
defect
this
interruption
came
from
marat
and
what
is
that
asked
cimourdain
clemency
replied
marat
and
he
went
on
he
is
firm
in
the
assault
but
after
the
victory
he
shows
his
weakness
he
grants
indulgences
he
is
too
merciful
and
forgiving
he
protects
and
nuns
he
saves
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
aristocrats
he
releases
prisoners
and
lets
the
priests
go
free
a
grave
fault
murmured
cimourdain
a
crime
you
would
do
better
to
call
it
said
marat
sometimes
said
danton
often
said
robespierre
almost
always
insisted
marat
yes
when
one
has
to
deal
with
the
enemies
of
one
country
it
may
always
be
called
a
crime
said
cimourdain
marat
turned
towards
the
latter
and
what
then
would
you
do
with
a
republican
chief
who
would
set
a
royalist
leader
at
liberty
he
inquired
i
should
agree
with
léchelle
i
would
have
him
shot
or
guillotined
said
marat
he
might
take
his
choice
said
cimourdain
danton
began
to
laugh
the
one
seems
to
me
as
good
as
the
other
you
are
quite
sure
to
have
one
or
the
other
muttered
marat
and
averting
his
eyes
from
danton
he
fixed
them
again
on
cimourdain
so
citizen
cimourdain
if
you
caught
a
republican
chief
stumbling
you
would
have
him
beheaded
within
hours
well
resumed
marat
i
agree
with
robespierre
citizen
cimourdain
must
be
sent
as
a
delegate
from
the
committee
of
public
safety
to
the
commander
of
the
exploring
division
of
the
coast
army
what
is
this
commander
name
by
the
way
robespierre
beginning
to
turn
over
his
papers
replied
he
is
a
nobleman
it
is
an
excellent
plan
to
set
a
priest
to
guard
a
nobleman
said
danton
either
one
of
them
singly
and
alone
i
am
inclined
to
distrust
but
when
taken
together
i
have
no
fear
of
them
they
keep
a
mutual
watch
over
each
other
and
go
on
very
well
the
expression
of
indignation
peculiar
to
cimourdain
face
grew
more
pronounced
but
doubtless
aware
that
the
observation
was
based
upon
truth
he
did
not
turn
towards
danton
as
he
lifted
his
severe
voice
if
the
republican
commander
intrusted
to
my
care
makes
a
false
step
he
will
suffer
the
penalty
of
death
robespierre
with
his
eyes
still
resting
on
his
portfolio
said
here
is
the
name
the
commander
in
charge
of
whom
you
will
be
placed
to
conduct
yourself
in
his
regard
at
your
own
discretion
is
a
former
viscount
called
gauvain
cimourdain
turned
pale
gauvain
he
exclaimed
marat
observed
cimourdain
pallor
the
viscount
gauvain
repeated
cimourdain
yes
said
robespierre
well
exclaimed
marat
gazing
steadfastly
at
cimourdain
there
was
a
brief
silence
broken
by
marat
citizen
cimourdain
do
you
accept
the
appointment
of
commissioner
delegate
to
the
commander
gauvain
with
the
condition
which
you
yourself
have
laid
down
is
it
agreed
it
is
replied
cimourdain
with
increasing
pallor
robespierre
took
the
pen
that
lay
beside
him
and
in
his
slow
and
regular
handwriting
traced
four
lines
on
the
sheet
of
paper
headed
committee
of
public
safety
after
signing
it
he
passed
the
pen
and
paper
to
danton
who
signed
and
the
signature
of
marat
who
had
not
once
removed
his
eyes
from
the
pale
face
of
cimourdain
was
added
to
the
others
robespierre
taking
back
the
sheet
dated
it
and
gave
it
to
cimourdain
who
read
on
it
the
following

only
adopted
by
the
convention
on
the
of
october
in
response
to
the
proposition
of
romme
while
cimourdain
was
reading
marat
continued
to
watch
him
then
in
a
tone
as
though
speaking
to
himself
he
said
all
this
must
be
confirmed
by
a
decree
from
the
convention
or
by
a
special
resolution
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
something
still
remains
to
be
done
citizen
cimourdain
where
do
you
live
asked
robespierre
cour
du
commerce
indeed
then
you
are
a
neighbor
of

said
danton
robespierre
continued
there

to
lose

said
cimourdain

they
separated

the
convention
i
we
are
approaching
the
summit
the
convention
is
before
our
eyes
and
in
the
presence
of
this
lofty
eminence
the
gaze
grows
steady
nothing
more
towering
ever
rose
above
the
human
horizon
there
is
but
one
himalaya
but
one
convention
the
convention
may
perhaps
be
called
the
culminating
point
in
history
during
its
lifetime
an
assembly
actually
lives
one
did
not
realize
what
it
was
its
supreme
grandeur
was
not
appreciated
by
its
contemporaries
who
were
too
much
terrified
to
be
dazzled
mediocrities
and
moderate
hills
levy
no
severe
tax
on
one
admiration
but
the
majestic
inspires
a
holy
horror
whether
it
be
the
majesty
of
genius
or
of
a
mountain
an
assembly
or
a
masterpiece
too
close
proximity
excites
alarm
every
peak
seems
exaggerated
the
ascent
is
fatiguing
and
one
loses
breath
in
climbing
its
sharp
acclivities
misses
his
footing
on
the
slopes
and
is
wounded
by
the
cragged
surfaces
which
in
themselves
are
beauties
the
foaming
torrent
indicates
the
presence
of
the
chasm
the
summit
is
veiled
in
clouds
whether
ascending
or
descending
it
is
equally
frightful
hence
one
feels
the
influence
of
terror
rather
than
of
admiration
a
kind
of
aversion
to
grandeur
which
is
a
strange
enough
sensation
while
gazing
on
the
abyss
one
can
not
always
appreciate
its
sublimity
the
monster
is
more
evident
than
the
miracle
it
was
thus
that
men
first
judged
the
convention
the
purblind
undertook
to
fathom
an
abyss
whose
depths
could
only
be
sounded
by
the
eagle
we
behold
it
in
the
perspective
outlining
the
granite
profile
of
the
french
revolution
against
the
calm
and
tragic
background
of
the
heavens
ii
the
of
july
set
the
nation
free
the
of
august
hurled
its
thunderbolts
the
of
september
founded
a
new
era
for
the
of
september
was
the
equinox
the
equilibrium
the
of
justice
according
to
the
remark
of
romme
the
republic
was
proclaimed
beneath
this
sign
of
equality
and
justice
heralded
so
to
speak
by
a
constellation
the
convention
is
the
first
avatar
of
the
people
it
was
the
convention
that
turned
the
new
and
glorious
page
introducing
the
future
of
every
idea
requires
a
visible
embodiment
every
principle
needs
a
habitation
a
church
means
the
four
walls
within
which
the
almighty
has
his
every
dogma
must
have
its
temple
when
the
convention
became
a
fact
the
first
problem
was
to
locate
it
at
first
it
was
established
in
the
manège
but
afterwards
at
the
tuileries
here
they
raised
a
platform
and
arranged
scenery
painted
in
gray
by
david
also
rows
of
benches
and
a
square
tribune
there
were
parallel
pilasters
with
massive
plinths
and
long
rectangular
stems
and
square
enclosures
into
which
the
multitude
crowded
and
which
were
called
public
tribunes
a
roman
velarium
and
grecian
draperies
and
amid
these
right
angles
and
straight
lines
the
convention
was
installed
a
tempest
confined
within
geometrical
limits
on
the
tribune
the
red
cap
was
painted
in
gray
at
first
the
royalists
ridiculed
this
gray
this
artificial
hall
this
pasteboard
monument
this
sanctuary
of
this
pantheon
of
mud
and
spittle
how
quickly
it
was
destined
to
vanish
the
pillars
were
made
of
the
arches
of
thin
deal
boards
the
were
mastic
the
entablature
was
of
pine
the
statues
were
of
plaster
the
marble
was
painted
the
walls
were
of
canvas
and
in
this
provisional
shelter
france
has
recorded
deeds
that
can
never
be
forgotten
during
the
early
sessions
of
the
convention
the
walls
of
the
hall
of
the
manège
were
covered
with
the
advertisements
with
which
paris
swarmed
at
the
time
of
the
return
from
varennes
on
one
might
be
read
the
king
returns
whoever
applauds
him
will
be
chastised
whoever
insults
him
will
be
hung
on
another
peace
keep
your
hats
on
your
heads
he
is
about
to
pass
before
his
judges
on
another
the
king
took
aim
at
the
nation
but
his
weapon
hung
fire
now
the
nation
has
its
turn
on
another
the
law
the
law
it
was
within
these
walls
that
the
convention
sat
in
judgment
on
louis
xvi
at
the
tuileries
now
called
the
palais
national
where
the
convention
had
held
its
sessions
from
the
of
may
the
assembly
hall
occupied
the
space
between
the
pavillon
de
called
pavillon
unité
and
the
pavillon
marsan
called
pavillon
liberté
the
pavillon
de
flore
was
now
called
the
assembly
hall
was
accessible
by
the
grand
staircase
of
jean
bullant
the
entire
of
the
palace
below
the
first
story
occupied
by
the
assembly
was
a
kind
of
long
guardroom
littered
with
the
luggage
and
of
the
various
troops
mounting
guard
over
the
convention
the
assembly
had
a
special
guard
of
honor
called
the
grenadiers
of
the
convention
a
tricolored
ribbon
divided
the
palace
occupied
by
the
assembly
from
the
garden
where
the
people
passed
in
and
out
iii
let
us
finish
our
description
of
the
assembly
hall
everything
concerning
this
terrible
place
is
of
interest
the
first
object
to
attract
one
attention
on
entering
was
a
tall
statue
of
liberty
placed
between
two
large
windows
this
hall
which
was
formerly
the
king
theatre
had
now
become
the
stage
of
revolution
it
was
metres
long
ten
metres
in
width
and
eleven
in
height
this
elegant
and
superb
hall
built
by
vigarani
for
the
use
of
the
courtiers
was
hidden
beneath
the
rude
which
served
to
support
the
weight
of
the
people
in
the
only
point
of
support
upon
which
this
of
the
public
tribunes
rested
was
a
single
post
which
well
deserves
honorable
mention
this
post
consisted
of
one
solid
piece
ten
metres
in
circumference
and
few
caryatides
have
done
an
equal
amount
of
work
for
years
it
bore
the
severe
pressure
of
revolution
it
has
supported
applause
enthusiasm
insult
clamors
and
tumults
the
tremendous
chaos
of
wrath
the
fury
of
insurrection
and
never
given
way
beneath
its
burden
after
the
convention
it
witnessed
the
council
of
the
ancients
on
the
brumaire
it
was
relieved
at
that
time
percier
replaced
this
wooden
pillar
by
columns
of
marble
that
did
not
last
so
long
an
architect
ideal
is
sometimes
peculiar
that
of
the
architect
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
was
the
curved
path
of
a
in
its
flight
the
architect
of
carlsruhe
conceived
the
ideal
of
a
fan
and
the
conception
of
the
architect
who
built
the
hall
where
the
convention
established
itself
on
the
of
may
was
apparently
a
huge
bureau
drawer
for
it
was
long
as
well
as
high
and
flat
a
great
semicircle
had
been
added
to
one
of
the
long
sides
of
the
parallelogram
this
was
the
amphitheatre
with
seats
for
the
representatives
but
neither
tables
nor
desks
who
wrote
a
great
deal
used
to
write
resting
his
paper
on
his
knee
facing
the
benches
was
the
tribune
before
it
the
bust
of
and
behind
it
the
president
the
head
of
the
bust
projected
slightly
above
the
edge
of
the
tribune
which
afterwards
was
the
cause
of
its
removal
the
amphitheatre
consisted
of
nineteen
semicircular
benches
rising
one
above
the
other
some
of
which
had
been
lengthened
in
order
to
fit
into
the
corners
by
means
of
other
benches
cut
off
for
the
purpose
in
the
semicircle
beneath
at
the
foot
of
the
tribunal
were
the
places
of
the
ushers
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
tribune
hung
a
placard
nine
feet
high
set
in
a
black
wooden
frame
and
bearing
on
its
two
pages
separated
by
a
kind
of
sceptre
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
on
the
other
side
was
an
empty
space
which
was
afterwards
occupied
by
a
similar
frame
containing
the
constitution
of
the
year
with
the
two
pages
separated
by
a
sword
above
the
tribune
over
the
head
of
the
orator
from
a
deep
loge
divided
into
two
compartments
and
filled
with
people
floated
three
immense
tricolored
banners
arranged
in
a
horizontal
position
resting
on
an
altar
upon
which
could
be
read
the
following
words
the
law
behind
this
altar
rose
like
the
sentinel
of
freedom
of
speech
an
enormous
roman
fasces
as
tall
as
a
column
two
colossal
statues
placed
erect
against
the
wall
faced
the
representatives
lycurgus
on
the
president
right
hand
solon
on
his
left
with
plato
towering
above
the
mountain
the
statues
stood
on
simple
wooden
blocks
resting
on
a
long
projecting
cornice
that
encircled
the
hall
separating
the
people
from
the
assembly
the
spectators
leaned
their
elbows
on
this
cornice
the
black
wooden
frame
enclosing
the
proclamation
of
the
rights
of
man
reached
to
the
cornice
interfering
with
the
symmetry
of
the
entablature
an
infraction
of
the
straight
line
that
made
chabot
growl
it
is
ugly
he
said
to
vadier
the
heads
of
the
statues
were
decorated
with
wreaths
of
oak
and
laurel
green
curtains
on
which
similar
wreaths
were
painted
in
a
deeper
shade
of
the
same
color
fell
in
heavy
folds
from
the
surrounding
cornice
draping
the
entire
lower
floor
of
the
hall
occupied
by
the
assembly
above
this
drapery
the
wall
was
white
and
bare
in
this
wall
as
if
carved
by
a
chisel
without
moulding
or
ornament
were
two
stories
of
public
tribunes
the
square
ones
below
the
round
ones
above
according
to
the
the
influence
of
vitruvius
was
still
acknowledge
the
archivolts
were
superimposed
upon
the
architraves
there
were
ten
tribunes
on
each
of
the
long
sides
of
the
hall
and
two
huge
boxes
at
both
ends
in
all
there
sat
the
assembled
crowd
the
spectators
in
the
lower
tribunes
overflowed
their
bounds
grouping
themselves
on
every
projection
along
the
cornice
a
long
iron
bar
firmly
fastened
at
the
point
of
support
served
as
a
rail
to
the
upper
tribunes
and
protected
the
spectators
from
the
pressure
of
the
crowds
that
ascended
the
stairs
once
however
a
man
who
was
pitched
suddenly
into
the
assembly
below
escaped
death
by
falling
partly
upon
massieu
bishop
of
beauvais
whereupon
he
exclaimed
really
a
bishop
has
his
use
then
after
all
the
hall
of
the
convention
was
large
enough
to
contain
two
thousand
persons
and
on
the
days
of
insurrections
even
three
thousand
the
convention
held
two
sessions
one
during
the
day
and
one
in
the
evening
the
back
of
the
president
chair
was
round
studded
with
gilt
nails
his
table
was
supported
by
four
winged
monsters
with
a
single
foot
who
might
have
been
supposed
to
have
come
forth
from
the
apocalypse
to
witness
the
revolution
they
seemed
to
have
been
unharnessed
from
ezekiel
chariot
to
drag
the
tumbril
of
samson
on
the
president
table
stood
a
huge
bell
almost
as
large
as
a
a
big
copper
inkstand
and
a
parchment
portfolio
which
contained
the
record
of
proceedings
the
blood
from
many
a
severed
head
borne
aloft
on
the
end
of
a
pike
has
dripped
upon
this
table
nine
steps
led
to
the
tribune
these
steps
were
high
steep
and
difficult
of
ascent
gensonné
once

in
the
act
of

to
serve
your
apprenticeship
cried
carrier
in
the
corners
of
the
hall
where
the
walls
seemed
rather
bare
the
architect
had
placed
roman
fasces
as
ornaments
with
the
axe
bound
on
the
outside
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
tribune
pedestals
supported
two
candelabra
twelve
feet
high
each
bearing
four
pairs
of
argand
lamps
for
each
public
box
there
was
a
similar
candelabra
and
on
the
pedestals
of
these
candelabra
circles
were
carved
which
the
people
called
guillotine
collars
the
seats
of
the
assembly
rising
almost
to
the
cornice
of
the
tribunes
gave
the
representatives
and
the
people
an
opportunity
to
chat
with
one
another
the
exits
of
the
tribunes
opened
into
a
labyrinth
of
corridors
often
echoing
with
wild
and
tumultuous
sounds
the
convention
outgrowing
the
limits
of
the
palace
ace
overflowed
into

neighboring
hotels
of
longueville
and
coigny

we
may
credit

letter
it
was
to
the
hôtel
coigny
that
the
royal
furniture
was
removed
after
the
of
august
it
took
two
entire
months
to
empty
the
tuileries
the
committees
were
lodged
in
the
vicinity
of
the
hall
those
of
legislation
agriculture
and
commerce
at
the
those
of
the

the

at
the
the
lodgings
of
the
committee
of
general
safety
were
accessible
to
those
of
the
public
safety
through
a
dark
corridor
lighted
night
and
day
by
a
lantern
a
for
the
spies
of
all
parties
who
came
and
went
talking
in
whispers
the
bar
of
the
convention
had
been
changed
several
times
usually
it
was
at
the
right
hand
of
the
president
at
both
ends
of
the
hall
the
two
vertical
partitions
that
shut
off
the
concentric
semicircles
of
the
amphitheatre
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
allowed
space
enough
between
partition
and
wall
for
two
long
and
narrow
passages
closed
at
either
end
by
square
doors
which
afforded
entrance
and
exit
a
door
opening
upon
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
and
leading
directly
into
the
hall
served
for
the
admittance
of
the
representatives
this
hall
ineffectually
lighted
during
the
day
by
windows
whose
insufficient
glimmer
was
replaced
by
livid
torches
when
twilight
fell
seemed
ever
shrouded
in
night
the
lamplight
sessions
were
lugubrious
the
artificial
light
seeming
really
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
the
darkness
no
man
could
see
his
neighbor
from
all
parts
of
the
hall
indistinct
groups
of
faces
seemed
to
be
mocking
each
other
people
passed
one
another
without
recognition
one
day
laignelot
hastening
to
the
tribune
jostled
some
one
in
the
descending
passage
i
beg
pardon

he
said
for
whom
do
you
take
me
replied
a
hoarse
voice

me
marat
said
laignelot
below
one
tribune
on
either
bide
of
the
president
was
reserved
for
strange
to
say
privileged
spectators
were
admitted
to
the
convention
the
draperies
of
these
tribunes
the
only
ones
thus
adorned
were
caught
back
to
the
middle
of
the
architrave
by
golden
cords
and
tassels
the
tribunes
of
the
people
were
bare
the
general
effect
was
stern
unconventional
and
yet
correct
the
union
of
propriety
and
fierceness
is
the
essence
of
a
revolutionary
life
the
hall
of
the
convention
presented
a
perfect
example
of
what
artists
have
since
called
the
messidor
architecture
it
was
at
once
massive
and
frail
the
builders
of
that
period
mistook
symmetry
for
beauty
the
renaissance
had
said
its
last
word
under
louis
and
a
reaction
had
set
in
the
standards
of
nobility
and
purity
had
been
so
exaggerated
that
that
which
was
really
noble
had
degenerated
into
insipidity
and
purity
itself
had
become
inexpressibly
wearisome
prudery
may
exist
in
architecture
after
the
dazzling
orgies
of
form
and
color
of
the
eighteenth
century
art
had
begun
a
system
of
diet
and
allowed
itself
only
a
straight
line
this
style
of
improvement
resulted
in
ugliness
and
art
was
thereby
reduced
to
a
skeleton
a
phenomenal
condition
which
is
the
drawback
to
this
kind
of
wisdom
and
abstinence
the
style
is
so
strict
that
it
becomes
meagre
apart
from
all
political
emotion
the
mere
sight
of
this
architecture
made
one
shiver
dimly
recalling
the
old
theatre
with
its
garlanded
boxes
its
ceiling
of
azure
and
crimson
its
chandelier
and
girandoles
with
their
prismatic
reflections
glittering
like
diamonds
its
upholstery
the
profusion
of
cupids
and
nymphs
on
its
curtain
and
draperies
all
that
royal
and
amorous
idyl
painted
sculptured
and
gilded
which
once
irradiated
this
gloomy
place
with
its
smile
and
then
casting
one
eyes
upon
these
severe
rectangular
lines
cold
and
sharp
as
steel
made
one
think
of
boucher
guillotined
by
david
iv
he
who
looked
upon
the
assembly
utterly
forgot
the
hall
he
who
witnessed
the
drama
was
oblivious
to
the
theatre
nothing
more
misshapen
and
at
the
same
time
sublime
a
crowd
of
heroes
a
herd
of
cowards
wild
beasts
on
the
mountain
reptiles
in
the
swamp
there
all
those
combatants
the
ghosts
of
swarmed
elbowed
each
other
quarrelling
threatening
fighting
and
living
out
their
lives
a
convocation
of
titans

the
ocean
the
impetus
came
from
above
there
was
an
inherent
force
in
the
convention
which
might
be
called
a
will
not
in
the
sense
of
an
individual
quality
but
belonging
to
the
assembly
as
a
body
and
this
will
was
an
idea
indomitable
and
boundless
which
from
the
heavens
above
descended
into
the
darkness
below
men
called
it
revolution
and
wherever
it
passed
some
men
were
overthrown
and
others
exalted
one
would
be
scattered
like
foam
while
another
was
dashed
to
pieces
against
the
rocks
it
kept
its
goal
well
in
mind
as
it
drove
the
maelstrom
before
it
to
impute
revolution
to
men
is
like
attributing
the
tides
to
the
waves
revolution
is
a
manifestation
of
the
unknown
you
may
call
it
good
or
evil
according
as
you
aspire
to
the
future
or
cling
to
the
past
but
leave
it
to
its
authors
it
would
seem
to
be
the
joint
product
of
great
events
and
great
individualities
but
is
in
reality
the
result
of
events
alone
events
plan
the
expenditures
for
which
men
pay
the
bills
events

the

was
signed
by

desmoulins
the
of

by

the

by

the
of

by

and
the

but
desmoulins
danton
marat
grégoire

are
merely
clerks
the
majestic
and
mysterious
compiler
of
those
grand
pages
was
almighty
god
wearing
the
mask
of
destiny
robespierre
believed
in
god
he
did
indeed
revolution
is
one
form
of
the
eternal
phenomenon
that
circumscribes
us
on
all
sides
and
which
we
call
necessity
in
the
presence
of
this
mysterious
complication
of
benefits
and
wretchedness
rises
the
wherefore
of
history
this
answer
may
be
the
reply
of
one
who
knows
nothing
as
well
as
that
of
one
who
knows
all
in
the
presence
of
these
monstrous
catastrophes
which
both
devastate
and
revivify
civilization
one
hesitates
to
sit
in
judgment
on
the
details
to
blame
or
to
praise
men
on
account
of
the
result
is
very
much
like
praising
or
criticising
the
ciphers
on
account
of
the
sum
total
the
inevitable
is
sure
to
happen
if
the
wind
is
to
blow
it
will
blow
but
the
eternal
serenity
remains
untouched
by
these
blasts
like
the
starlit
sky
above
the
tempest
truth
and
justice
sit
enthroned
above
all
revolutions
xii
such
was
this
immeasurable
convention
like
an
intrenched
encampment
of
the
human
race
attacked
simultaneously
by
all
the
powers
of
darkness
the
of
an
army
of
ideas
besieged
by
its
foes
an
immense
bivouac
of
human
intellect
on
the
slope
of
a
precipice
nothing
in
history
can
be
compared
to
this
assembly
which
contained
within
itself
senate
and
people
conclave
and
areopagus
and
public
square
tribunal
and
accused
the
convention
always
yielded
to
the
wind
but
this
wind
came
from
the
mouth
of
the
people
and
it
was
the
breath
of
god
and
after
the
lapse
of
eighty
years
every
time
the
convention
presents
itself
to
the
mind
of
any
man
whomsoever
whether
philosopher
or
historian
he
can
not
but
pause
and
meditate
since
no
man
can
be
indifferent
to
that
grand
procession
of
shadows

following
the

in

rue

marat
according
to
the
intention
which
he
had
announced
to
simonne
évrard
went
to
the
convention
there
chanced
to
be
present
a
certain
marquis
louis
de
montaut
an
admirer
of
marat
the
same
who
afterwards
presented
to
the
convention
a
decimal
clock
surmounted
by
a
bust
of
marat
just
as
marat
entered
chabot
approached
montant
he
said
montaut
looked
up
why
do
you
call
me
because
that
what
you
are
i
of
course
since
you
were
once
a
marquis
never
nonsense
my
father
was
a
soldier
my
grandfather
was
a
weaver
what
folly
is
this
montaut
my
name
is
not
montaut
what
is
it
then
my
name
is
maribon
very
well
declared
chabot
it
is
all
one
to
me
and
he
added
between
his
teeth
every
man
nowadays
pretends
that
he
is
no
marquis
marat
stopped
in
the
corridor
and
looked
at
montaut
and
chabot
whenever
he
came
in
a
murmur
would
pass
through
the
crowd
but
always
at
a
respectful
distance
it
was
quiet
in
his
immediate
vicinity
marat
paid
no
attention
whatever
he
scorned
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
in
this
dim
shadow
obscuring

probably
he
is
since
he
is
here
in

certainly
what
liberties
he
allows
himself
that
he
should
dare
to
come
to
the
convention
in
such
a
garb
since
he
came
one
day
crowned
with
laurels

not

him
that
on

they
pretended
not

continued
to
talk
of
other
matters

have
you
heard
dussaulx
what
the

yes
i
knew
them
both
what
about
them
you
know
they
were
so
frightened
that
they
saluted
all
the
red
caps
of
the
turnkeys
and
one
day
refused
to
take
a
hand
at
because
a
pack
of
cards
with
kings
and
queens
was
offered
them
well
they
were
guillotined
yesterday
both
of
them
yes

how
did
they
behave
in

like

what

did
they
cut

whereupon
dussaulx
exclaimed

had
begun
to
read
a
report
on
the
subject
of
the

from

had
started
with

to

by

with

had
taken

a

from

ending
with

repulsed
them
and
they
retreated
leaving

in

interrupted

went
on
postscript

have
no

we
have
ceased
to
take

marat
as
usual
stood
motionless
paying
no
attention
to
what
was
going
on
apparently
absorbed
in
deep
preoccupation
he
held
a
paper
in
his
hand
crumpling
it
between
his
fingers
had
it
been
unfolded
certain
words
in
the
handwriting
of

in
answer
no
doubt
to
some
question
of
marat
might
have
been
read
nothing
can
be
done
in
opposition
to
the
supreme
authority
of
the
delegated
commissioners
especially
those
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
although
génissieux
said
in
the
session
of

is
more

a

a
marat
ceased
crumpling
the
paper
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
walked
slowly
towards
montaut
and
chabot
who
had
continued
their
conversation
and
had
not
seen
him
enter
chabot
was
just
saying
maribon
or
montaut
listen
to
this
i
have
just
left
the
committee
of
public
safety
and
what
are
they
doing
there
they
are
setting
a
priest
to
watch
a
noble
ah
a
noble
like
yourself
i
am
not
a
noble
said
montaut
to
be
watched
by
a
priest
like
you
i
am
not
a
priest
said
chabot
and
both
men
began
to
laugh
please
give
us
a
more
definite
account
well
here
is
the
tale
a
priest
cimourdain
by
name
has
been
delegated
with
full
powers
to
a
viscount
gauvain
who
is
in
command
of
the
exploring
division
of
the
army
of
the
coast
now
the
difficulty
is
to
prevent
the
nobleman
from
cheating
and
the
priest
from
betraying
there
will
be
no
trouble
about
that
you
have
only
to
make
death
the
third
party
that
is
what
i
came
for
said
marat
they
looked
up
marat
said
chabot
we
seldom
see
you
at
our
sessions
my
doctor
has
ordered
baths
replied
marat
ah
you
had
better
beware
of
baths
continued
chabot
seneca
died
in
a
bath
marat
smiled
there
is
no
nero
here
chabot
i
should
say
there
was
since
you
are
here
said
a
gruff
voice
it
was
danton
who
was
passing
on
his
way
towards
his
seat
marat
did
not
turn
round
he
thrust
his
head
in
between
the
faces
of
montaut
and
chabot
listen
i
have
come
on
serious
business
one
of
us
three
must
propose
the
draft
of
a
decree
to
the
convention
i
am
not
the
man
said
montaut
they
pay
no
attention
to
me
i
am
a
marquis
neither
will
they
listen
to
me
i
am
a
capuchin
said
chabot
nor
to
me
for
i
am
marat
a
silence
ensued
marat
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
was
not
accessible
to
questions
still
montaut
ventured
upon
one
what
decree
would
you
like
the
assembly
to
pass
marat
a
decree
inflicting
the
penalty
of
death
on
any
military
chief
who
allows
a
rebel
prisoner
to
escape
chabot
interposed
there
is
such
a
decree
already
it
was
made
a
law
at
the
end
of
april
that
amounts
to
nothing
whatever
said
marat
everywhere
throughout
the
vendée
prisoners
are
helped
to
escape
and
any
man
may
shelter
them
with
impunity
that
is
because
the
decree
is
no
longer
in
force
marat
it
must
be
revived
chabot
no
doubt
it
needs
to
be
revived
and
to
accomplish
this
we
must
address
the
convention
there
will
be
no
need
to
do
that
marat
the
committee
of
public
safety
will
suffice
the
object
will
be
attained
added
montaut
if
the
committee
of
public
safety
order
the
decree
to
be
placarded
in
every
commune
of
the
vendée
and
make
two
or
three
suitable
examples
of
men
in
authority
rejoined
chabot
of
the
generals
marat
mumbled
between
his
teeth
yes
i
suppose
that
will
answer
marat
continued
chabot
go
and
say
that
to
the
committee
of
public
safety
yourself
marat
gazed
steadily
at
him
which
was
not
pleasant
even
for
a
chabot
chabot
he
said
the
committee
of
public
safety
meets
at
robespierre
house
i
do
not
visit
robespierre
then
i
will
go
myself
said
montaut
very
well
replied
marat
the
next
day
a
mandate
from
the
committee
of
public
safety
was
sent
in
all
directions
ordering
the
authorities
of
the
cities
and
villages
of
the
vendée
not
only
to
publish
but
also
strictly
to
execute
a
decree
awarding
the
penalty
of
death
to
all
who
were
known
to
aid
and
abet
the
escape
of
brigands
and
rebel
prisoners
this
decree
was
but
the
first
step
the
convention
was
to
go
still
farther
than
that
several
months
later
on
the
brumaire
in
the
year
ii
november
when
laval
opened
its
gates
to
the
vendean
fugitives
it
decreed
that
every
city
that
sheltered
rebels
should
be
demolished
and
destroyed
the
princes
of
europe
on
their
side
in
the
manifesto
of
the
duke
of
brunswick
suggested
by
the
émigrés
and
drawn
up
by
the
marquis
of
linnon
steward
to
the
duke
of
orleans
declared
that
every
frenchman
taken
with
arms
in
his
hand
should
be
shot
and
if
but
a
hair
fell
from
the
head
of
the
king
paris
should
be
razed
to
the
ground

the

the

its

describe

we
can
not
refuse
to
acknowledge
that
the
vendée
is
well
worth
the
trouble
for
it
is
a
prodigy
that
war
of
the
ignorant
so
dull
and
yet
so
splendid
so
detestable
and
at
the
same
time
so
magnificent
was
at
once
the
despair
and
the
pride
of
the
nation
in
the
act
of
wounding
france
the
vendée
covered
her
with
glory
there
are
times
when
human
society
presents
enigmas
whose
meaning
becomes
evident
to
the
wise
while
for
the
ignorant
it
remains
obscure
signifying
nothing
more
than
violence
and
barbarism
a
philosopher
is
slow
to
accuse
he
takes
into
consideration
the
disturbances
caused
by
these
problems
which
never
pass
without
casting
a
shadow
like
a
cloud
he
who
would
understand
the
vendée
must
picture
the
antagonism
of
the
french
revolution
on
the
one
hand
and
the
breton
peasant
on
the
other
face
to
face
with
these
unparalleled
events
this
tremendous
promise
of
every
advantage
at
once
this
fit
of
rage
on
the
part
of
civilization
this
excess
of
infuriated
progress
to
be
accompanied
by
an
improvement
that
could
neither
be
measured
nor
understood
stands
this
serious
and
peculiar
savage
this
man
with
the
keen
eyes
and
long
hair
who
lives
on
milk
and
chestnuts
whose
ideas
are
bounded
by
his
roof
by
his
hedge
and
by
his
ditch
who
can
distinguish
each
village
by
the
sound
of
its
bells
who
drinks
nothing
but
water
yet
wears
a
leather
waistcoat
worked
with
silken
arabesques
a
man
uncultivated
dressed
in
embroidered
garments
who
tattoes
his
clothes
as
his
ancestors
the
celts
used
to
tattoo
their
faces
who
respects
his
master
in
the
person
of
his
executioner
who
speaks
a
dead
language
which
is
equivalent
to
keeping
his
mind
in
a
tomb
goading
his
oxen
sharpening
his
scythe
hoeing

mood
often
standing
motionless
for
hours
on
the
wide

gloomily
to

it

this

failed
to

the
peasant
has
confidence
in
the
field
that
nourishes
him
no
less
than
in
the
wood
that
serves
to
hide
him
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
conceive
an
idea
of
the
forests
of
brittany
they
were
cities
in
themselves
nothing
could
be
more
secret
more
silent
or
more
impenetrable
than
those
tangled
thickets
of
briers
and
branches
offering
shelter
repose
and
silence
no
solitude
could
seem
more
and
sepulchral
if
one
could
like
a
flash
of
lightning
have
felled
the
entire
forest
at
a
single
stroke
a
swarm
of
human
beings
would
have
stood
forth
revealed
within
those
shades
concealed
on
the
outside
by
coverings
of
stones
and
branches
were
wells
round
and
narrow
sinking
at
first
vertically
and
then
horizontally
widening
under
the
ground
like
funnels
and
ending
in
dark
chambers
wells
like
these
discovered
by
westermann
in
brittany
were
also
found
in
egypt
by
cambyses
with
this
difference
that
while
the
egyptian
caves
in
the
desert
held
dead
men
only
those
in
the
forests
of
brittany
contained
living
human
beings
one
of
the
wildest
glades
in
the
woods
of
misdon
intersected
by
subterranean
passages
and
cells
wherein
a
mysterious
population
moved
to
and
fro
was
called
la
grande
ville
another
glade
just
as
deserted
above
ground
and
no
less
populous
below
was
called
la
place
royale
this
subterranean
life
in
brittany
had
existed
from
time
immemorial
man
had
there
sought
refuge
from
his
brother
man
hence
these
like
the
dens
of
reptiles
hollowed
out
under
the
trees
they
dated
from
the
times
of
the
druids
and
some
of
the
crypts
were
as
old
as
the
dolmens
all
the
evil

the

thousand

trained

in

during
this
wild
trampling
the
people
made
up
their
minds
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
disappear
one
after
the
other
the
troglodytes
seeking
to
escape
from
the
celts
the
celts
from
the
romans
the
bretons
from
the
normans
the
huguenots
from
the
catholics
and
the
smugglers
from
the
excise
officers
had
sought
refuge
first
in
the
forests
then
underground
it
is
thus
that
tyranny
forces
the
nations
to
the
last
resource
of
the
hunted
beast
for
two
thousand
years
had
despotism
in
all
its
varied
forms
of
conquest
vassalage
fanaticism
and
taxation
hunted
down
this
unfortunate
and
distracted
brittany
it
was
like
an
inexorable
constantly
changing
its
method
of
attack
men
disappeared
underground
while
that
terror
which
is
a
sort
of
rage
was
brooding
in
human
souls
and
the
dens
in
the
forests
were
in
waiting
for
them
the
french
republic
sprang
into
existence
brittany
thinking
this
compulsory
deliverance
but
a
new
form
of
oppression
broke
into
open
rebellion
a
mistake
usually
made
by
enslaved
peoples
iii
connivance
of
men
and
forests
thus
the
tragic
forests
of
brittany
once
more
resumed
their
ancient
rôle
of
servant
and
accomplice
to
revolution
the
subsoil
of
such
a
forest
was
like
a
madrepore
pierced
and
intersected
in
all
directions
by
a
secret
labyrinth
of
mines
cells
and
galleries
each
of
these
hidden
cells
was
large
enough
to
shelter
five
or
six
men
the
only
difficulty
was
in
breathing
certain
mysterious
ciphers
have
been
preserved
that
give
us
a
clew
to
this
powerful
organization
of
the
peasant
rebellion
in
in
the
forest
of
pertre
where
the
prince
de
talmont
had
taken
refuge
not
a
breath
could
be
heard
not
a
trace
of
human
life
was
visible
and
yet
focard
had
there
mustered
six
thousand
men
in
morbihan
in
the
forest
of
meulac
not
a
man
of
all
the
eight
thousand
there
was
to
be
seen
these
two
forests
le
pertre
and
meulac
are
not
however
to
be
reckoned
among
the
great
breton
forests
it
would
have
been
dangerous
walking
over
their
explosive
soil
these
treacherous
copses
with
their
multitudes
of
combatants
lurking
in
a
sort
of
subterranean
labyrinth
were
like
great
black
sponges
from
which
beneath
the
pressure
of
revolution
giant
foot
civil
war
gushed
forth
invisible
battalions
were
lying
in
wait
this
army
unknown
to
the
world
wound
its
way
along
under
the
feet
of
the
republican
armies
leaping
out
of
the
ground
at
times
in
vast
numbers
and
disappearing
as
suddenly
possessing
the
power
of
vanishing
at
will
no
less
than
the
gift
of
ubiquity
it
was
like
the
descending
avalanche
that
leaves
but
a
cloud
of
dust
behind
colossi
with
a
marvellous
genius
for
contraction
giants
in
warfare
dwarfs
in
flight
jaguars
with
the
habits
of
moles
moreover
there
were
woods
as
well
as
forests
as
the
village
ranks
below
the
city
so
the
woods
bear
a
similar
relation
to
the
forests
which
they
serve
to
connect
after
the
fashion
of
a
labyrinth
old
castles
fortresses
once
upon
a
time
hamlets
that
had
been
camps
farms
covered
with
ambushes
and
snares
divided
by
ditches
and
fenced
in
by
trees
formed
the
meshes
of
the
net
in
which
the
republican
armies
were
caught
all
this
was
called
the
bocage
there
was
the
wood
of

and
when

captured
the
grenadiers
from
the

of

in
a
encounter
the

which
the
reader
will
remember
was
reconnoitred
by
the
paris
battalion
and
many
others
besides
in
several
of
these
forests
and
woods
there
were
not
only
subterranean
villages
grouped
around
the
headquarters
of
the
chief
but
actual
hamlets
composed
of
low
cabins
hidden
under
the
trees
in
such
numbers
that
the
forest
was
often
filled
with
them
sometimes
the
smoke
betrayed
their
presence
two
among
these
hamlets
in
the
forest
of
misdon
have
become
famous
lorrière
near
létang
and
the
group
of
huts
called

the
women
lived
in
the
huts
and
the
men
in
the
caves
the
galleries
of
the
fairies
and
the
old
celtic
mines

utilized
for
purposes
of
warfare
food
was
conveyed
to
the
dwellers
underground
and
some
there
were
who
forgotten
died
of
hunger
they
however
were
awkward
fellows
who
had
not
sense
enough
to
uncover
their
wells
this
cover
usually
made
of
moss
and
branches
and
arranged
so
skilfully
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
it
on
the
outside
from
the
surrounding
grass
was
yet
easily
opened
and
closed
from
the
inside
a
den
like
this
known
under
the
name
of
la
loge
was
hollowed
out
with
great
care
and
the
earth
taken
therefrom
thrown
into
some
neighboring
pond
the
inside
walls
and
the
floor
were
afterwards
lined
with
ferns
and
moss
it
was
fairly
comfortable
save
for
the
lack
of
light
fire
bread
and
air
to
rise
from
underground
and
appear
among
the
living
without
due
precaution
possibly
to
disinter
themselves
at
an
inappropriate
moment
would
be
a
serious
business
they
might
chance
to
encounter
an
army
on
the
march
those
were
dangerous
woods
snares
with
a
double
trap
the
blues
dared
not
enter
and
the
whites
dared
not
come
out
iv
their
life
under
ground
the
men
wearied
of
living
in
these
beasts
lairs
would
sometimes
venture
to
come
out
by
night
and
dance
on
the
neighboring
moor
or
else
they
said
prayers
by
way
of
killing
time
jean
chouan
made
us
say
our
beads
from
morning
till
night
says
bourdoiseau
it
was
almost
impossible
when
the
season
arrived
to
prevent
the
men
of
from
going
to
the
fête
de
la
gerbe
they
clung
to
their
own
ideas
says
that
denys
disguised
himself
as
a
woman
to
go
to
the
play
at
laval
after
which
he
returned
to
his
den
all
at
once
they
would
rush
out
in
search
of
death
changing
one
tomb
for
another
sometimes
they
would
lift
the
cover
of
their
grave
and
listen
for
any
chance
sounds
of
battle
in
the
distance
following
it
with
their
ears
guided
by
the
steady
fire
of
the
republicans
and
the
intermittent
shots
of
the
royalists
when
the
suddenly
ceased
they
knew
that
the
royalists
had
lost
the
day
but
if
the
scattering
shots
continued
receding
into
the
distance
it
was
a
sign
that
the
victory
was
theirs
the
whites
always
pursued
the
blues
never
did
so
because
the
country
was
against
them
these
underground
belligerents
were
wonderfully
nothing
could
be
more
rapid
or
more
mysterious
than
their
means
of
communication
the
bridges
and
wagons
had
all
been
destroyed
yet
they
found
means
to
keep
one
another
informed
of
all
that
went
on

to
send
timely
warning
of
danger

established

with

they
made

they
forced
the

to
retreat
to

at
that

they
were
in
the
height
of
their

later
when
chalbos
defeated

the

left
behind
them
on
the
dishonored
battlefield
two
cannon
bearing
the

at

the

as

it

puysaye

several

saved
the

again
he
says
that

refrained

to
avoid
the

called
the
who
joined
the

the
jacobin
herd
and
exterminated
them
more
fiercely
than
they
did
their
other
foes
they
enjoyed
carnage
like
soldiers
and
revelled
in
massacre
like
brigands
to
shoot
the
was
their
delight
they
called
it
breaking
their
fast
at
fontenay
one
of
their
priests
named
barbotin
killed
an
old
man
with
a
blow
from
his
sabre
at
one
of
their
captains
a
nobleman
shot
the
solicitor
of
the
commune
and
took
his
watch
at
machecoul
for
the
space
of
five
weeks
they
made
a
practice
of
slaughtering
the
republicans
at
the
rate
of
thirty
a
day
each
string
of
thirty
they
called
a
rosary
behind
this
row
of
men
there
was
a
trench
prepared
into
which
the
men
fell
back
as
they
were
shot
and
when
as
sometimes
happened
a
man
was
still
alive
he
was
buried
as
if
he
were
dead
such
acts
have
been
witnessed
in
our
own
times
joubert
president
of
the
district
had
his
wrists
sawed
off
they
had
handcuffs
for
the
blues
made
expressly
to
cut
the
flesh
they
slaughtered
them
in
the
public
squares
sounding
the

signed
himself

who
like

knotted
around

burned

of
pornic
with
the
inhabitants
in
their
dwellings
meanwhile
carrier
was

answered

the
breton

looked
very

the

on

ten

into

thus
without

of

captured
the
very

besieged
by

they
valued
a
cartridge
far
beyond
a
gold
louis
they
burst
into
tears
whenever
they
lost
sight
of
their
village
belfry
to
run
away
seemed
to
them
the
simplest
affair
in
the
world
at
such
times
their
leaders
would
exclaim
throw
away
your
sabots
but
keep
your
guns
when
munitions
failed
they
said
their
beads
and
proceeded
to
take
the
powder
from
the
caissons
of
the
republican
artillery
and
afterwards
demanded
powder
from
the
english
on
the
approach
of
the
enemy
they
concealed
their
wounded
in
the
tall
grain
or
among

the
summer
of
had
been
a
very
rainy
one
but
that
of
was
so
extremely
warm
that
although
the
civil
war
had
gone
far
towards
ruining
the
roads
in
brittany
the
people
thanks
to
the
fine
weather
were
able
to
travel
from
place
to
place
for
a
dry
soil
makes
the
best
road
at
the
close
of
a
clear
july
day
about
an
hour
after
sunset
a
man
on
horseback
riding
from
the
direction
of
avranches
stopped
before
the
little
inn
called
the
situated
at
the
entrance
of
pontorson
for
some
years
its
sign
had
borne
the
following
inscription
good
cider
obtained
here
the
day
had
been
a
very
warm
one
but
now
the
wind
was
beginning
to
rise
the
traveller
was
wrapped
in
an
ample
cloak
that
fell
over
his
back
he
wore
a
hat
ornamented
with
a
tricolored
cockade
which
was
rather
a
bold
thing
to
do
in
a
country
like
this
with
its
hedges
and
sharpshooting
for
which
a
cockade
offered
an
excellent
target
the
cloak
fastened
around
his
neck
was
pushed
back
leaving
his
arms
free
and
revealing
at
the
same
time
a
tricolored
belt
and
the
butts
of
two
pistols
protruding
from
it
while
a
sabre
hung
down
below
the
cloak
at
the
sound
of
the
horses
hoofs
stopping
before
the
inn
the
door
opened
and
the
landlord
came
out
holding
a
lantern
in
his
hand
it
was
just
at
twilight
when
it
is
still
light
out
of
doors
although
dark
within
the
host
glanced
at
the
cockade
do
you
mean
to
stop
here
citizen
no
where
are
you
going
then
to
dol
in
that
case
you
would
do
better
to
return
to
avranches
or
else
remain
at
pontorson
why
so
because
they
are
fighting
at
dol
ah
said
the
rider
then
he
continued
give
my
horse
some
oats
the
host
having
brought
the
trough
and
poured
the
oats
into
it
proceeded
to
unbridle
the
horse
which
began
at
once
snuffing
and
champing
while
the
dialogue
went
on
is
this
one
of
the
requisition
horses
citizen
no
does
it
belong
to
you
yes
i
bought
him
and
paid
for
him
where
do
you
come
from
from
paris
not
directly
no
i
should
say
not
the
roads
are
blocked
but
the
post
still
runs
as
far
as
alençon
i
left
it
there
ah
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
shall
have
no
more
posts
in
france
the
horses
are
all
gone
one
worth
three
hundred
francs
costs
six
hundred
and
the
price
of
fodder
is
beyond
all
reason
i
used
to
be
a
postmaster
and
now
you
see
i
keep
a
tavern
out
of
thirteen
hundred
and
thirteen
postmasters
two
hundred
have
resigned
have
you
been
travelling
according
to
the
new
tariff
citizen
you
mean
the
tariff
of
the
of
may
yes
twenty
sous
a
post
for
a
carriage
twelve
for
a
gig
five
for
a
van
did
you
not
buy
this
horse
at
alençon
yes
and
you
have
been
travelling
all
day
yes
since
dawn
and
yesterday
and
the
day
before
i
should
think
so
you
came
by
the
way
of
domfront
and
mortain
and
avranches
you
had
better
take
my
advice
and
rest
citizen
are
you
not
tired
your
horse
certainly
is
horses
may
be
tired
but
men
have
no
right
to
give
way
to
fatigue
again
the
host
gazed
at
the
traveller
whose
face
grave
calm
and
severe
was
framed
by
gray
hair
casting
a
glance
along
the
road
that
was
deserted
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
he
said
and
so
you
are
travelling
alone
i
have
an
escort
where
is
it
my
sabre
and
pistols
the
innkeeper
went
for
a
pail
of
water
and
while
he
was
watering
the
horse
he
contemplated
the
traveller
saying
to
himself
he
looks
like
a
priest
all
the
same
the
rider
continued
you
say
there
is
fighting
at
dol
yes
they
are
just
about
ready
to
begin
who
is
fighting
one
against
another
how
is
that
i
mean
that
the
who
is
a
republican
is
fighting
against
another
who
takes
sides
with
the
king
but
there
is
no
longer
a
king
there
is
the
little
fellow
but
the
strangest
part
is
that
the
two
are
related
to
each
other
here
the
rider
listened
attentively
while
the
innkeeper
continued
one
is
a
young
man
and
the
other
an
old
one
it
is
the
fighting
against
his
the
uncle
is
a
royalist
while
the
nephew
is
a
patriot
the
uncle
commands
the
whites
the
nephew
the
blues
ah
they
will
show
no
mercy
to
each
other
you
may
be
sure
it
is
a
war
to
death
death
yes
citizen
perhaps
you
might
like
to
see
the
polite
speeches
they
fling
at
each
other
head
here
is
a
placard
which
the
old
man
has
managed
to
post
on
all
the
houses
and
trees
and
which
i
found
had
been
stuck
on
my
very
door
the
host
held
up
his
lantern
to
a
square
bit
of
paper
glued
upon
one
of
the
panels
of
his
door
and
as
it
was
written
in
very
large
characters
the
rider
was
able
to
read
it
as
he
sat
in
his
saddle
the
marquis
de
lantenac
has
the
honor
to
inform
his
the
viscount
gauvain
that
if
the
marquis
is
so
fortunate
as
to
take
him
prisoner
le
viscount
may
rest
assured
that
he
will
be
speedily
shot
and
here
is
the
reply
continued
the
innkeeper
he
turned
so
as
to
throw
the
light
of
his
lantern
upon
a
second
placard
on
the
other
panel
of
the
door
directly
opposite
the
first
one
gauvain
warns
lantenac
that
if
he
catches
him
he
will
have
him
shot
yesterday
the
first
placard
was
posted
on
my
door
said
the
host
and
this
morning
came
the
second
he
was
not
kept
waiting
for
his
answer
the
traveller
in
an
undertone
as
though
speaking
to
himself
uttered
certain
words
which
the
innkeeper
caught
without
fully
understanding
their
meaning
yes
this
is
more
than
waging
war
against
one
native
land
it
is
carrying
it
into
the
family
and
it
must
needs
be
done
great
regenerations
are
only
to
be
purchased
at
this
price
and
the
traveller
with
his
eyes
still
riveted
to
the
second
placard
lifted
his
hand
to
his
hat
and
saluted
it
the
host
continued
you
see
citizen
this
is
the
way
matters
stand
in
the
cities
and
in
larger
towns
we
are
in
favor
of
revolution
but
in
the
country
they
are
opposed
to
it
which
amounts
to
saying
that
we
are
frenchmen
in
the
cities
and
bretons
in
the
villages
it
is
a
war
between
the
peasants
and
the
townspeople
they
call
us
and
we
call
them
they
have
the
nobles
and
the
priests
on
their
side
not
all
of
them
interrupted
the
rider
that
is
true
citizen
for
here
we
have
a
viscount
fighting
against
a
marquis
and
i
verily
believe
he
added
aside
that
i
am
speaking
to
a
priest
at
this
minute
which
of
the
two
is
likely
to
gain
the
day
i
should
say
the
viscount
so
far
but
he
has
a
hard
time
of
it
the
old
man
is
a
tough
customer
they
belong
to
the
gauvains
a
noble
family
in
these
parts
of
which
there
are
two
branches
the
marquis
de
lantenac
is
the
head
of
the
older
and
the
viscount
gauvain
of
the
younger
branch
the
two
branches
are
fighting
each
other
you
never
see
this
among
trees
but
often
among
men
this
marquis
de
lantenac
is
in
brittany
the
peasants
regard
him
as
a
prince
on
the
very
day
he
landed
he
rallied
eight
thousand
men
in
a
week
three
hundred
parishes
had
risen
if
he
had
only
been
able
to
establish
a
foothold
on
the
coast
the
english
would
have
made
a
descent
luckily
gauvain
who
strange
to
say
is
his
was
on
the
spot
he
is
a
republican
commander
and
has
got
the
upper
hand
of
his
and
then
as
good
luck
would
have
it
this
lantenac
at
the
time
of
his
arrival
when
he
was
massacring
a
multitude
of
prisoners
gave
orders
to
have
two
women
shot
one
of
whom
had
three
children
who
had
been
adopted
by
a
paris
battalion
this
roused
the
rage
of
the
battalion
which
is
called
the
there
are
but
few
of
the
original
parisians
left
but
they
are
desperate
fighters
they
have
been
incorporated
into
commandant
gauvain
division
nothing
can
resist
them
their
great
object
is
to
avenge
the
women
and
recapture
the
children
no
one
knows
what
the
old
marquis
did
with
the
little
ones
and
that
is
what
infuriates
the
parisian
grenadiers
had
not
these
children
been
mixed
up
in
it
this
war
would
not
have
been
what
it
is
the
viscount
is
a
good
and
brave
young
fellow
but
the
old
man
is
a
terrible
marquis
the
peasants
call
this
the
war
of
saint
michel
against
beelzebub
you
know
maybe
that
saint
michel
is
the
patron
of
these
parts
there
is
a
mountain
named
after
him
in
the
middle
of
the
bay
they
give
him
credit
for
conquering
the
devil
and
burying
him
under
another
hill
not
far
away
called
tombelaine
yes
murmured
the
rider
tumba
beleni
the
tomb
of
belenus
belus
bel
belial
beelzebub
i
see
that
you
are
well
informed
and
the
host
said
to
himself
he
knows
latin
surely
he
must
be
a
priest
then
he
added
well
citizen
this
war
is
beginning
all
over
again
for
the
peasants
no
doubt
they
think
the
royalist
general
is
saint
michel
and
the
patriot
commander
beelzebub
but
if
there
is
a
devil
it
is
lantenac
and
gauvain
is
an
angel
if
there
ever
was
one
will
you
take
nothing
citizen
i
have
my
gourd
and
a
bit
of
bread
but
you
have
not
told
me
what
is
going
on
at
dol
to
be
sure
well
gauvain
is
in
command
of
the
exploring
division
of
the
coast
now
lantenac
plan
was
to
stir
up
a
general
insurrection
to
bring
lower
normandy
to
the
aid
of
lower
brittany
to
throw
open
the
door
to
pitt
and
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
the
great
vendean
army
in
the
shape
of
twenty
thousand
english
and
two
hundred
thousand
peasants
gauvain
has
checkmated
this
plan
he
holds
the
coast
and
drives
lantenac
back
into
the
interior
and
the
english
into
the
sea
lantenac
was
here
but
gauvain
dislodged
him
recaptured
drove
him
out
from
avranches
and
villedieu
and
prevented
him
from
reaching
granville
he
is
manoeuvring
now
to
force
him
to
retreat
into
the
forest
of
fougères
and
there
to
surround
him
yesterday
everything
was
favorable
and
gauvain
was
here
with
his
division
all
at
once
mind
you
the
old
man
who
is
a
shrewd
one
made
a
point
the
news
came
that
he
had
marched
on
dol
if
he
should
take
it
and
succeeds
in
establishing
a
battery
on
for
he
has
artillery
that
will
give
the
english
a
chance
to
land
and
then
all
is
lost
that
is
the
reason
why
gauvain
who
has
a
head
on
his
shoulders
knowing
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
consulted
no
one
nor
did
he
wait
for
orders
but
giving
the
signal
to
saddle
and
harnessing
his
artillery
he
collected
his
troops
drew
his
sabre
and
while
lantenac
is
hurrying
towards
dol
gauvain
is
all
ready
to
pounce
upon
lantenac
and
dol
is
to
be
the
place
where
these
two
breton
heads
will
clash
and
a
famous
crash
it
will
be
they
are
at
it
now
how
long
does
it
take
to
reach
dol
for
troops
with
artillery
carriages
at
least
three
hours
but
they
are
there
now
the
traveller
as
he
listened
said
you
are
right
i
think
i
can
hear
the
cannon
the
host
too
was
listening
yes
citizen
and
the
firing
is
steady
you
had
better
spend
the
night
here
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
going
over
there
i
can
not
stop
i
must
continue
my
journey
you
are
wrong
i
do
not
know
anything
about
your
business
but
the
risk
is
great
and
unless
all
that
you
hold
dearest
in
the
world
is
at
stake
that
is
precisely
the
state
of
things
replied
the
rider
now
supposing
your
son
you
are
very
near
the
truth
said
the
rider
the
innkeeper
raised
his
head
as
he
said
to
himself
and
yet
i
thought
this
citizen
was
a
priest
then
after
a
reflection
he
added
but
a
priest
may
have
children
after
all
put
the
bridle
back
on
my
horse
said
the
traveller
how
much
do
i
owe
you
after
receiving
his
pay
the
host
put
the
trough
and
bucket
against
the
wall
and
came
back
to
the
traveller
since
you
are
determined
to
go
take
my
advice
you
must
be
going
to
now
then
do
not
go
by
the
way
of
dol
there
are
two
roads
one
leading
through
dol
and
the
other
along
the
coast
there
is
very
little
difference
in
their
length
the
road
along
the
coast
passes
through
cherrueix
and
you
leave
dol
to
the
south
and
cancale
to
the
north
and
at
the
end
of
this
street
citizen
you
will
come
to
a
place
where
the
two
roads
fork
that
of
dol
to
the
left
that
of
to
the
right
mark
my
words
if
you
go
to
dol
you
will
plunge
headlong
into
the
massacre
so
do
not
take
the
turning
but
keep
to
the
right
thank
you
said
the
traveller
and
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
as
it
was
now
quite
dark
he
soon
vanished
in
the
gloom
and
the
innkeeper
lost
sight
of
him
when
the
traveller
reached
the
end
of
the
street
where
the
two
roads
forked
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
innkeeper
calling
to
him
from
the
distance
turn
to
your
right
he
turned
to
the
left
ii
dol
illustration
dol
a
city
in
brittany
as
the
old
records
call
it
is
not
really
a
city
it
is
a
street
a
grand
old
gothic
street
with
rows
of
houses
supported
by
pillars
on
both
sides
of
it
these
houses
are
not
built
in
straight
lines
but
stand
irregularly
now
and
then
elbowing
into
the
street
which
is
to
be
sure
a
very
wide
one
the
rest
of
the
town
is
a
mere
network
of
lanes
all
leading
into
this
great
diametrical
street
emptying
into
it
one
might
say
like
streams
into
a
river
with
towering
above
it
the
city
with
neither
gates
nor
walls
could
not
have
withstood
a
siege
but
the
street
was
quite
capable
of
sustaining
one
the
houses
like
promontories
which
but
fifty
years
ago
were
still
standing
and
the
two
pillared
galleries
bordering
the
street
made
it
a
strong
and
impregnable
redoubt
each
of
the
houses
was
a
fortress
in
itself
and
the
enemy
would
have
found
himself
forced
to
capture
them
one
by
one
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
street
stood
the
old
market
the
innkeeper
of
the
had
told
the
truth
a
furious
battle
was
raging
in
dol
even
while
he
was
speaking
a
nocturnal
duel
between
the
whites
who
arrived
in
the
morning
and
the
blues
who
appeared
at
night
had
burst
suddenly
upon
the
town
the
forces
were
unequal
the
whites
numbering
six
thousand
while
the
blues
were
only
fifteen
hundred
but
they
fought
with
equal
fury
surprising
as
it
may
seem
it
was
the
fifteen
hundred
who
attacked
the
six
thousand
a
mob
pitted
against
a
phalanx
on
one
side
were
six
thousand
peasants
with
images
of
the
sacred
heart
upon
their
leathern
waistcoats
white
ribbons
on
their
round
hats
christian
emblems
on
their
leather
cuffs
rosaries
hanging
from
their
belts
carrying
pitchforks
oftener
than
sabres
and
carbines
without
bayonets
dragging
along
cannon
by
means
of
ropes
wretchedly
equipped
undisciplined
with
no
suitable
weapons
yet
mad
with
rage
on
the
other
side
were
fifteen
thousand
soldiers
wearing
hats
with
the
tricolored
cockade
coats
with
broad
lapels
and
crossed
short
sabres
with
copper
hilts
muskets
with
long
bayonets
and
disciplined
obedient
though
savage
knowing
how
to
obey
like
men
who
could
at
need
command
volunteers
like
the
others
but
patriots
withal
although
barefooted
and
in
rags
paladins
in
the
shape
of
peasants
fighting
in
defence
of
monarchy
barefooted
heroes
in
the
ranks
of
the
revolution
while
the
life
and
soul
of
both
royalists
and
republicans
was
centred
in
their
leaders
lantenac
the
man
advanced
in
years
and
the
young
gauvain
standing
side
by
side
in
the
revolution
with
young
giants
like
danton
and
robespierre
were
the
ideal
and
youthful
forms
of
hoche
and
marceau
and
like
unto
them
was
gauvain
gauvain
was
thirty
years
of
age
with
the
chest
of
hercules
the
solemn
eye
of
a
prophet
and
the
laugh
of
a
child
he
never
smoked
he
neither
drank
nor
swore
he
carried
a
with
him
throughout
the
entire
war
and
took
great
care
of
his
nails
his
teeth
and
his
luxuriant
brown
hair
whenever
they
halted
it
was
his
habit
carefully
to
shake
his
commander
uniform
riddled
with
balls
and
whitened
with
dust
as
it
was
though
always
rushing
headlong
into
the
thickest
of
the
fray
he
had
never
been
wounded
his
voice
unusually
melodious
could
assume
at
need
the
imperative
ring
of
command
he
set
the
example
of
sleeping
on
the
ground
in
the
wind
the
rain
and
the
snow
wrapped
in
his
cloak
with
his
charming
head
resting
on
a
stone
his
was
a
heroic
and
innocent
soul
let
him
but
take
a
sabre
in
his
hand
he
was
straightway
transformed
he
had
that
effeminate
aspect
that
changes
to
something
formidable
in
battle
a
thinker
and
philosopher
withal
in
short
a
youthful
sage
beautiful
to
look
upon
as
alcibiades
his
speech
showed
the
wisdom
of
socrates
in
that
grand
improvisation
which
men
called
the
french
revolution
this
young
man
at
once
became
a
leader
the
division
which
he
had
formed
was
like
a
roman
legion
an
army
on
a
small
scale
complete
in
itself
it
consisted
of
infantry
and
cavalry
it
had
its
scouts
its
pioneers
its
sappers
its
engineers
and
as
the
roman
legion
had
its
catapults
this
army
had
its
cannon
three
pieces
strengthened
the
division
while
leaving
it
easy
to
handle
lantenac
was
also
a
military
leader
but
a
more
accomplished
one
more
cautious
and
at
the
same
time
more
daring
the
veritable
old
hero
is
cooler
than
a
younger
man
because
he
is
farther
removed
from
the
heyday
of
life
and
more
daring
from
the
consciousness
that
he
is
nearer
death
what
has
he
to
lose
so
slight
a
matter
this
explains
the
bold
and
yet
scientific
manoeuvres
of
lantenac
yet
on
the
whole
in
this
obstinate
between
the
old
and
the
young
gauvain
almost
always
had
the
advantage
and
he
owed
this
rather
to
chance
than
to
anything
in
himself
every
sort
of
even
though
it
may
be
terrible
falls
to
the
lot
of
youth
victory
has
something
feminine
in
its
nature
lantenac
was
exasperated
with
gauvain
first
because
his
nephew
had
defeated
him
and
second
because
he
was
his
nephew
what
possessed
him
to
be
jacobin
a
gauvain
unruly
youngster
that
he
was
his
heir
for
the
marquis
had
no
children
a
almost
a
grandchild
ah
cried
this
quasi
grandfather
if
he
falls
into
my
hands
i
will
kill
him
like
a
dog
the
republic
moreover
had
good
reason
to
feel
uneasy
about
this
marquis
de
lantenac
he
had
no
sooner
landed
than
its
terror
began
the
mere
utterance
of
his
name
was
like
a
spread
through
the
vendean
insurrection
of
which
he
straightway
became
the
centre
in
a
revolt
of
this
kind
where
each
one
is
jealous
of
his
neighbor
where
each
has
his
bush
or
his
ravine
if
a
superior
leader
appears
the
separate
chiefs
who
have
been
on
a
level
will
rally
round
him
and
submit
themselves
to
his
authority
nearly
all
the
forest
captains
had
joined
lantenac
and
whether
near
or
remote
they
all
obeyed
him
only
gavard
who
had
been
the
first
to
join
him
had
departed
and
why
was
this
because
he
had
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
the
republic
and
been
in
a
position
of
authority
gavard
had
held
all
the
secrets
and
had
adopted
the
system
of
civil
war
which
lantenac
had
come
to
change
and
replace
a
successor
can
hardly
agree
with
a
man
of
that
stamp
the
shoe
of
la
rouarie
was
not
a
fit
for
lantenac
and
so
gavard
had
gone
to
join
bonchamp
lantenac
belonged
to
the
military
school
of
frederic
ii
he
understood
the
art
of
warfare
which
consists
of
combining
the
greater
with
the
lesser
he
favored
neither
the
great
catholic
and
royal
army
that
mass
of
confusion
destined
to
be
crushed
nor
the
guerilla
troops
scattered
through
the
thickets
and
hedges
useful
to
harass
but
powerless
to
crush
there
is
either
no
end
to
guerilla
warfare
or
else
it
comes
to
an
unfortunate
one
it
begins
by
attacking
the
republic
and
ends
by
robbing
a
diligence
lantenac
did
not
propose
to
carry
on
the
breton
war
altogether
in
the
open
country
like
la
rochejaquelein
nor
yet
in
the
forest
like
chouan
he
neither
approved
of
the
vendée
nor
of
the
chouannerie
he
believed
in
real
warfare
he
was
willing
to
use
the
peasant
but
he
wished
to
support
him
by
the
soldier
he
required
bands
for
strategy
and
regiments
for
tactics
the
village
armies
so
easily
disbanded
he
considered
excellent
for
an
attack
an
ambush
or
a
surprise
but
he
felt
that
they
lacked
solidity
they
were
like
water
in
his
hands
he
sought
a
solid
foundation
for
this
unstable
and
diffusive
warfare
to
the
savage
army
of
the
forest
he
proposed
to
add
regular
troops
as
a
sort
of
pivot
about
which
to
manoeuvre
the
peasants
had
this
scheme
and
terrible
as
it
was
proved
successful
the
vendée
would
never
have
been
conquered
but
where
could
regular
troops
be
found
where
look
for
soldiers
where
seek
for
regiments
and
find
a
army
in
england
hence
lantenac
determination
that
the
english
should
effect
a
landing
thus
do
parties
compromise
with
their
consciences
he
quite
lost
sight
of
the
red
coat
eclipsed
as
it
was
by
the
white
cockade
lantenac
had
but
one
idea
first
to
seize
upon
some
point
on
the
coast
and
then
to
deliver
it
into
the
hands
of
pitt
it
was
with
this
object
that
seeing
dol
unprotected
he
had
thrown
himself
upon
it
knowing
that
once
in
possession
of
dol
he
could
readily
gain
and
by
means
of
the
latter
gain
a
footing
on
the
coast
the
spot
was
well
chosen
from
the
cannon
would
sweep
fresnois
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
would
keep
the
fleet
of
cancale
at
a
distance
and
leave
the
whole
beach
from
to
open
to
an
attack
in
order
to
insure
success
lantenac
had
brought
with
him
six
thousand
of
the
most
active
men
in
the
regiment
at
his
disposal
together
with
all
his
artillery
ten
culverins
one
and
one
he
proposed
to
establish
a
strong
battery
on
on
the
principle
that
a
thousand
shots
fired
from
ten
cannon
do
more
execution
than
fifteen
hundred
fired
from
five
cannon
with
six
thousand
men
he
felt
sure
of
success
in
the
direction
of
avranches
they
had
nothing
to
fear
but
gauvain
with
his
fifteen
hundred
men
towards
dina
there
was
léchelle
to
be
sure
with
thousand
but
he
was
twenty
leagues
away
in
regard
to
the
latter
lantenac
felt
quite
safe
the
distance
offsetting
the
numbers
and
as
for
gauvain
though
he
was
quite
near
his
force
was
very
small
we
may
here
remark
that
léchelle
was
a
fool
who
afterwards
allowed
his
thousand
men
to
be
slaughtered
on
the
moors
of
a
mistake
for
which
he
strove
to
atone
by
suicide
so
lantenac
felt
quite
safe
his
entrance
into
dol
had
been
sudden
and
stern
the
marquis
de
lantenac
enjoyed
a
hard
reputation
and
knowing
him
to
be
merciless
the
terrified
inhabitants
shut
themselves
up
in
their
houses
without
attempting
resistance
and
the
six
thousand
vendeans
installed
themselves
in
the
city
after
the
disorderly
fashion
of
a
band
of
rustics
it
was
almost
like
a
in
default
of
quartermasters
they
chose
their
own
quarters
camping
at
haphazard
cooking
in
the
open
air
dispersing
hither
and
yonder
through
the
churches
dropping
their
muskets
to
take
up
their
rosaries
lantenac
accompanied
by
a
few
artillery
officers
proceeded
without
delay
to
reconnoitre
leaving
whom
he
had
appointed
in
command
this
has
left
but
an
indistinct
trace
in
history
he
had
two
nicknames
in
token
of
his
massacre
of
the
patriots
and
because
there
was
something
indescribably
horrible
about
him
is
derived
from
and
old
word
which
expresses
a
superhuman
degree
of
ugliness
almost
godlike
in
its
terror
a
demon
a
satyr
an
ogre
an
old
manuscript
says
with
my
own
eyes
i
beheld
imânus
the
old
people
in
brittany
no
longer
know
who
was
nor
what
means
but
they
have
a
vague
idea
of
the
imânus
whose
name
is
interwoven
with
all
the
local
superstitions
he
still
is
spoken
of
in
trémorel
and
plumaugat
the
two
villages
where
has
left
the
impress
of
his
footstep
in
the
vendée
where
all
the
inhabitants
were
savages
was
the
barbarian
he
was
a
sort
of
cacique
tattooed
all
over
with
crucifixes
and
upon
his
face
was
the
hideous
almost
supernatural
glow
of
a
soul
unlike
that
of
any
other
human
being
he
was
as
brave
in
battle
as
satan
himself
and
atrociously
cruel
when
the
battle
was
over
his
heart
full
of
mysterious
determinations
now
urged
him
to
acts
of
devotion
now
to
deeds
of
wildest
fury
did
he
use
his
reason
yes
after
a
serpentine
fashion
heroism
was
his
murder
his
goal
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
how
his
resolutions
often
grand
in
their
very
monstrosity
could
have
entered
his
mind
he
was
capable
of
any
horror
when
least
expected
his
ferocity
was
on
a
scale
of
epic
grandeur
hence
his
peculiar
surname
imânus
the
marquis
de
lantenac
relied
upon
his
cruelty
but
while
none
could
dispute
the
fact
that
he
excelled
in
cruelty
in
matters
of
strategy
and
tactics
he
was
less
efficient
and
it
may
perhaps
have
been
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
marquis
when
he
made
him
his
but
however
that
may
be
he
left
him
behind
in
charge
with
the
injunction
to
look
after
matters
in
general
was
more
of
a
fighter
than
a
soldier
and
guarding
a
town
was
not
so
much
in
his
line
as
massacring
a
clan
would
have
been
still
he
posted
sentries
when
at
nightfall
the
marquis
having
decided
upon
the
position
of
his
battery
was
returning
to
dol
he
suddenly
caught
the
sound
of
cannon
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
he
saw
a
red
smoke
rising
from
the
street
this
meant
a
surprise
an
invasion
an
attack
fighting
was
going
on
in
the
town
although
not
easily
taken
by
surprise
he
was
now
utterly
amazed
for
he
had
anticipated
nothing
of
the
sort
what
could
it
mean
evidently
not
gauvain
for
a
man
would
hardly
attack
an
enemy
outnumbering
him
four
to
one
could
it
be
léchelle
but
was
it
possible
for
him
to
have
made
such
a
forced
march
léchelle
was
improbable
gauvain
impossible
lantenac
urged
on
his
horse
on
the
way
he
met
some
of
the
inhabitants
in
the
act
of
flight
but
when
he
questioned
them
they
seemed
beside
themselves
with
terror
crying
the
blues
the
blues
and
on
his
arrival
he
found
the
situation
a
bad
one
this
is
what
had
happened
iii
small
armies
and
great
battles
illustration
on
their
arrival
at
dol
the
peasants
as
we
have
seen
had
dispersed
through
town
each
man
guided
by
his
own
fancy
as
it
often
happens
when
on
obéit
as
the
vendeans
expressed
it
a
form
of
obedience
that
may
produce
heroes
but
not
soldiers
they
had
stored
their
artillery
together
with
the
baggage
under
the
arches
of
the
old
market
and
feeling
weary
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
said
their
beads
they
stretched
themselves
out
in
the
middle
of
the
principal
street
that
was
encumbered
rather
than
guarded
as
night
came
on
most
of
them
fell
asleep
pillowing
their
heads
on
their
knapsacks
some
having
their
wives
beside
them
for
it
often
happened
that
the
peasant
women
followed
the
men
in
the
vendée
women
about
to
become
mothers
frequently
acted
as
spies
it
was
a
mild
july
night
the
constellations
shone
forth
against
the
sky
the
entire
bivouac
which
might
have
been
mistaken
for
the
halt
of
a
caravan
rather
than
for
a
military
encampment
gave
itself
up
to
quiet
slumber
suddenly
by
the
glimmering
twilight
those
who
were
still
awake
perceived
three
cannon
levelled
at
the
entrance
of
the
principal
street
it
was
gauvain
he
had
surprised
the
guard
had
entered
the
town
and
with
his
division
held
the
entrance
of
the
street
a
peasant
started
up
crying
who
goes
there
and
fired
off
his
musket
a
followed
by
a
terrific
volley
of
musketry
was
the
reply
the
whole
sleeping
crowd
sprang
up
with
a
start
it
was
a
rude
shock
to
be
roused
by
a
volley
of
from
a
peaceful
sleep
beneath
the
stars
the
first
moment
was
terrific
there
is
nothing
more
tragic
than
the
confusion
of
a
crowd
they
snatched
their
weapons
many
fell
as
they
ran
yelling
to
and
fro
confused
by
the
unexpected
assault
the
lads
lost
their
heads
and
fired
madly
at
one
another
the
townspeople
bewildered
by
all
this
confusion
rushed
in
and
out
of
their
houses
shouting
to
each
other
as
they
wandered
helplessly
about
a
dismal
struggle
in
which
women
and
children
played
a
part
the
balls
whistling
through
the
air
left
streaks
of
light
in
the
darkness
behind
them
amid
the
smoke
and
tumult
a
constant
firing
issued
from
every
dark
corner
the
entanglement
of
the
and
was
added
to
the
general
confusion
the
horses
rearing
trampled
upon
the
wounded
whose
groans
could
be
heard
on
every
side
some
were
others
stupefied
officers
were
looking
for
their
men
and
soldiers
for
their
officers
in
the
midst
of
all
this
some
there
were
who
displayed
a
stolid
indifference
one
woman
seated
on
the
fragment
of
a
wall
was
nursing
her
babe
while
her
husband
with
bleeding
wounds
and
a
broken
leg
leaned
against
it
as
he
calmly
loaded
his
musket
and
fired
at
random
in
the
darkness
killing
or
not
as
it
happened
men
lying
flat
on
the
ground
fired
between
the
spokes
of
the
at
times
there
rose
a
hideous
din
of
clamors
and
again
the
thundering
voice
of
the
cannon
would
overwhelm
all
it
was
frightful
like
the
felling
of
trees
when
one
falls
upon
the
other
illustration
gauvain
from
his
ambush
aimed
with
precision
and
lost
but
few
men
but
at
last
the
peasants
intrepid
in
spite
of
the
disaster
ended
by
taking
the
defensive
they
fell
back
on
the
market
which
was
like
a
great
dark
fortress
with
its
forest
of
stone
pillars
there
they
made
a
stand
anything
that
resembled
a
forest
inspired
them
with
courage
the
imânus
did
his
best
to
atone
for
the
absence
of
lantenac
they
had
cannon
but
to
the
great
surprise
of
gauvain
they
made
no
use
of
them
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
artillery
officers
had
gone
with
the
marquis
to
reconnoitre
and
the
peasants
did
not
know
how
to
manage
the
culverins
and
but
they
riddled
with
balls
the
blues
who
cannonaded
them
the
peasants
answered
the
by
a
volley
of
musketry
they
now
had
the
advantage
of
a
shelter
having
heaped
up
the
drays
the
carts
the
baggage
and
all
the
small
casks
that
were
lying
about
in
the
old
market
thus
improvising
a
high
barricade
with
openings
through
which
they
could
pass
their
muskets
and
from
which
they
opened
a
deadly
fire
so
rapidly
had
they
worked
that
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
market
presented
an
impregnable
front
matters
were
beginning
to
look
serious
for
gauvain
the
sudden
transformation
of
a
market
into
a
fortress
and
the
peasants
assembled
in
a
solid
mass
within
was
a
condition
of
affairs
which
he
had
not
anticipated
he
had
taken
them
by
surprise
it
is
true
but
he
had
not
succeeded
in
routing
them
he
had
dismounted
and
holding
his
sword
by
the
hilt
he
stood
with
folded
arms
gazing
steadfastly
into
the
gloom
his
own
figure
distinctly
revealed
by
the
flame
of
the
torch
that
lighted
the
battery
a
target
for
the
men
of
the
barricade
of
which
fact
he
took
no
heed
as
he
stood
there
lost
in
thought
while
a
shower
of
balls
from
the
barricade
fell
around
him
he
set
his
cannon
against
their
rifles
and
victory
is
ever
on
the
side
of
the
he
who
has
artillery
is
sure
to
win
the
day
and
his
battery
gave
him
the
advantage
suddenly
a
flash
of
lightning
burst
forth
from
the
dark
market
there
came
a
report
like
a
peal
of
thunder
and
a
bullet
went
crashing
through
a
house
over
gauvain
head
the
barricade
was
paying
him
back
in
his
own
coin
what
was
going
on
this
was
a
new
development
the
artillery
was
no
longer
confined
to
one
side
a
second
ball
followed
the
first
embedding
itself
in
the
wall
close
to
gauvain
and
a
third
ball
knocked
off
his
hat
these
balls
were
of
a
calibre
so
heavy
that
they
must
have
been
fired
from
a
they
are
aiming
at
you
commander
cried
the
gunners
as
they
put
out
the
torch
and
gauvain
still
absorbed
in
his
reverie
stooped
to
pick
up
his
hat
some
one
was
indeed
aiming
at
gauvain
and
it
was
lantenac
the
marquis
had
just
reached
the
barricade
from
the
opposite
side
the
imânus
hastened
to
meet
him
monseigneur
we
have
been
taken
by
surprise
by
whom
i
do
not
know
is
the
road
to
dinan
open
i
believe
so
we
must
begin
to
retreat
we
have
done
so
many
have
already
fled
i
am
not
speaking
of
flight
but
of
retreat
why
did
you
not
use
the
artillery
the
men
were
beside
themselves
and
then
the
officers
were
absent
i
was
to
be
here
monseigneur
i
sent
everything
i
could
on
to
fougères
the
women
the
baggage
and
all
useless
incumbrances
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
three
little
prisoners
do
you
mean
the
children
yes
they
are
our
hostages
send
them
on
to
the
tourgue
so
saying
the
marquis
started
for
the
barricade
and
directly
after
his
arrival
things
took
on
another
aspect
the
barricade
was
not
well
constructed
for
artillery
there
was
room
for
but
two
cannon
the
marquis
placed
in
position
the
two
for
which
embrasures
were
made
as
he
was
leaning
on
one
of
the
cannon
watching
the
enemy
battery
through
the
embrasure
he
caught
sight
of
gauvain
it
is
he
he
cried
then
taking
the
swab
and
the
ramrod
he
loaded
the
piece
adjusted
the
sight
and
took
aim
three
times
he
aimed
at
gauvain
and
missed
him
but
the
third
shot
knocked
off
his
hat
bungler
murmured
lantenac
a
little
lower
and
i
should
have
had
his
head
suddenly
the
torch
went
out
and
he
had
only
darkness
before
him
well
let
it
go
he
said
and
turning
to
the
peasant
gunners
he
exclaimed
let
them
have
the
gauvain
for
his
part
was
also
in
deadly
earnest
the
situation
had
become
a
serious
one
since
the
development
of
this
new
phase
of
the
conflict
and
the
barricade
was
now
cannonading
him
who
could
tell
how
soon
it
might
pass
from
the
defensive
to
the
offensive
the
enemy
numbered
at
least
five
thousand
even
allowing
for
the
dead
and
the
fugitives
while
he
had
no
more
than
twelve
hundred
men
at
his
command
what
would
happen
to
the
republicans
if
the
enemy
should
become
aware
of
their
limited
number
their
rôles
would
soon
be
reversed
from
playing
the
part
of
assailants
he
would
become
the
object
of
assault
if
the
barricade
were
to
make
a
sortie
all
would
be
lost
what
was
to
be
done
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
think
of
attacking
the
barricade
in
front
an
attempt
to
capture
it
by
main
strength
would
be
folly
twelve
hundred
men
could
not
dislodge
five
thousand
imperative
as
it
was
to
make
an
end
of
it
knowing
as
he
did
that
delay
was
fatal
still
he
realized
that
to
force
the
enemy
hand
would
be
impossible
what
was
he
to
do
gauvain
belonged
to
this
neighborhood
he
was
familiar
with
the
town
and
knew
that
behind
the
old
market
where
the
vendeans
were
intrenched
was
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
and
crooked
streets
he
turned
to
his
lieutenant
the
brave
captain
guéchamp
who
afterwards
became
famous
for
clearing
the
forest
of
concise
where
jean
chouan
was
born
and
who
prevented
the
capture
of
bourgneuf
by
cutting
the
rebels
off
from
the
highway
that
led
to
the
pond
of
la
chaine
guéchamp
said
gauvain
i
intrust
you
with
the
command
fire
as
rapidly
as
possible
riddle
the
barricade
with
and
keep
them
busy
over
yonder
i
understand
said
guéchamp
mass
the
whole
column
with
their
guns
loaded
and
hold
them
in
readiness
for
an
attack
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
guéchamp
ear
it
shall
be
done
said
the
latter
gauvain
continued
are
all
our
drummers
ready
yes
we
have
nine
keep
two
and
give
me
seven
the
seven
drummers
silently
ranged
themselves
in
front
of
gauvain
step
forward
battalion
of
the
exclaimed
gauvain
twelve
soldiers
one
of
whom
was
a
sergeant
stepped
from
the
ranks
i
called
for
the
whole
battalion
said
gauvain
here
it
is
replied
the
sergeant
are
there
but
twelve
only
twelve
of
us
left
very
well
said
gauvain
this
sergeant
was
that
very
radoub
the
rough
and
kindly
soldier
who
in
the
name
of
the
battalion
had
adopted
the
three
children
found
in
the
forest
of
la
saudraie
it
will
be
remarked
that
only
half
that
battalion
was
massacred
at
and
radoub
by
good
luck
was
not
among
them
a
was
standing
near
and
gauvain
pointed
it
out
to
the
sergeant
let
your
men
weave
ropes
of
straw
and
bind
them
around
their
muskets
to
deaden
the
noise
when
they
clash
against
each
other
a
minute
went
by
the
order
was
silently
executed
in
the
darkness
it
is
done
said
the
sergeant
take
off
your
shoes
soldiers
continued
gauvain
we
have
none
replied
the
sergeant
including
the
drummers
they
numbered
nineteen
men
gauvain
was
the
twentieth
follow
me
in
single
file
cried
gauvain
let
the
drummers
go
before
the
battalion
you
will
command
the
battalion
sergeant
he
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
this
column
and
while
the
cannonading
still
continued
on
both
sides
these
twenty
men
glided
along
like
shadows
and
plunged
into
the
deserted
lanes
thus
they
proceeded
for
some
time
skirting
along
the
fronts
of
the
houses
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
town
were
dead
the
citizens
had
taken
refuge
in
their
cellars
every
door
was
barred
and
every
shutter
closed
not
a
light
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
but
through
this
silence
they
still
heard
the
awful
din
on
the
principal
street
the
cannonading
went
on
the
republican
battery
and
the
royal
barricade
spit
out
their
with
unabated
fury
illustration
after
marching
twenty
minutes
winding
in
and
out
gauvain
who
had
led
the
way
unerringly
through
this
darkness
reached
the
end
of
a
lane
that
led
into
the
principal
street
they
were
now
however
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
the
position
was
changed
on
that
side
there
was
no
intrenchment
a
common
mistake
of
barricade
builders
the
market
was
open
and
one
could
walk
in
under
the
pillars
where
several
stood
ready
to
leave
gauvain
and
his
nineteen
men
were
in
the
presence
of
the
five
thousand
vendeans
as
before
only
instead
of
facing
them
they
found
themselves
in
their
rear
gauvain
whispered
to
the
sergeant
the
straw
was
unwound
from
the
muskets
and
the
twelve
grenadiers
ranged
themselves
in
a
line
behind
the
corner
of
the
lane
while
the
seven
drummers
with
uplifted
drumstick
waited
for
the
signal
the
artillery
firing
was
intermittent
when
suddenly
during
the
interval
between
two
discharges
gauvain
raised
his
sword
and
in
a
voice
that
rang
out
like
a
clarion
upon
the
silence
exclaimed
two
hundred
men
to
the
right
two
hundred
to
the
left
the
rest
in
the
centre
the
drums
beat
and
the
twelve
were
fired
then
gauvain
uttered
the
formidable
of
the
blues
charge
bayonets
the
effect
was
wonderful
all
this
crowd
of
peasants
finding
themselves
assailed
in
the
rear
imagined
that
another
army
had
come
up
from
behind
at
the
same
time
on
hearing
the
beating
of
the
drums
the
column
which
held
the
upper
part
of
the
street
and
was
commanded
by
guéchamp
began
to
move
sounding
the
charge
in
its
turn
and
starting
on
the
run
attacked
the
barricade
the
peasants
saw
themselves
between
two
fires
a
panic
magnifies
and
at
such
moments
a
sounds
like
the
report
of
a
cannon
imagination
distorts
every
sound
and
the
barking
of
a
dog
seems
like
the
roar
of
a
lion
let
us
add
moreover
that
the
peasant
takes
fright
as
easily
as
a
thatch
catches
fire
and
as
quickly
as
a
burning
thatch
becomes
a
conflagration
a
panic
among
peasants
grows
into
a
rout
and
on
this
occasion
the
flight
was
beyond
description
in
a
few
moments
the
market
was
deserted
the
terrified
lads
scattered
in
all
directions
and
the
officers
were
helpless
the
imânus
killed
two
or
three
of
the
fugitives
but
it
was
of
no
avail
nothing
could
be
heard
save
the
cry
sauve
qui
peut
and
with
the
rapidity
of
a
cloud
driven
onward
by
a
hurricane
the
entire
army
scattered
through
the
streets
as
through
the
meshes
of
a
sieve
and
vanished
into
the
country
some
fled
towards
châteauneuf
some
towards
plerguer
and
others
in
the
direction
of
antrain
the
marquis
de
lantenac
who
was
the
last
man
to
leave
the
scene
spiked
the
guns
with
his
own
hands
and
then
quietly
and
calmly
took
his
departure
saying
as
he
went
it
is
evident
that
the
peasants
can
not
be
depended
upon
to
stand
their
ground
we
need
the
english
illustration
iv
a
second
time
illustration
they
had
won
the
victory
and
turning
to
the
men
of
the
battalion
of
the
gauvain
exclaimed
though
you
are
but
twelve
you
are
equal
to
a
thousand
one
word
from
the
chief
in
times
like
these
was
as
good
as
the
cross
of
honor
guéchamp
who
had
been
sent
by
gauvain
outside
the
city
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
captured
many
of
them
torches
were
lighted
and
the
town
was
searched
all
those
who
had
not
been
able
to
escape
surrendered
themselves
the
principal
street
illuminated
by
was
strewn
with
the
dead
and
the
wounded
the
fierce
struggle
that
always
terminates
a
battle
was
still
continued
by
a
few
groups
of
desperate
fighters
who
however
on
being
surrounded
threw
down
their
arms
and
surrendered
gauvain
had
observed
amid
the
wild
tumult
of
the
flight
a
fearless
man
vigorous
and
agile
as
a
faun
who
stood
his
own
ground
while
covering
the
flight
of
the
others
this
peasant
after
handling
his
musket
like
an
expert
alternately
firing
and
rising
the
butt
as
a
club
until
he
had
broken
it
now
stood
grasping
a
pistol
in
one
hand
and
a
sabre
in
the
other
and
no
man
dared
approach
him
suddenly
gauvain
saw
him
reel
and
lean
against
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
principal
street
he
was
evidently
wounded
but
he
still
held
his
sabre
and
his
pistols
gauvain
put
his
sword
under
his
arm
and
came
up
to
him
as
he
called
upon
him
to
surrender
the
man
gazed
steadily
at
him
while
the
blood
oozing
from
his
wound
formed
a
pool
at
his
feet
you
are
my
prisoner
said
gauvain
what
is
your
name
was
the
reply
you
are
a
brave
fellow
said
gauvain
extending
his
hand
long
live
the
king
cried
the
man
then
gathering
all
his
strength
and
raising
both
hands
simultaneously
he
fired
his
pistol
at
gauvain
heart
at
the
same
time
aiming
a
blow
at
his
head
with
the
sabre
this
movement
in
its
rapidity
was
yet
forestalled
by
the
action
of
another
a
horseman
had
appeared
on
the
scene
he
had
been
there
for
some
moments
without
attracting
attention
and
when
he
saw
the
vendean
lift
his
sabre
and
pistol
he
threw
himself
between
the
latter
and
gauvain
intercepting
the
by
his
own
person
while
his
horse
was
struck
by
the
and
both
horse
and
rider
fell
to
the
ground
thus
gauvain
life
was
saved
all
this
took
place
as
quickly
as
one
would
utter
a
cry
the
vendean
also
sank
to
the
pavement
the
blow
from
the
sabre
struck
the
man
full
in
the
face
he
lay
on
the
ground
in
a
swoon
the
horse
was
killed
illustration
gauvain
drew
near
asking
as
he
approached
if
any
could
tell
who
he
was
on
looking
at
him
more
closely
he
saw
that
the
blood
was
gushing
over
the
face
of
the
wounded
man
covering
it
as
with
a
red
mask
and
rendering
it
impossible
to
distinguish
his
features
one
could
see
that
his
hair
was
gray
he
has
saved
my
life
said
gauvain
does
any
one
here
know
him
commander
said
a
soldier
he
has
but
just
arrived
in
town
i
saw
him
coming
from
the
direction
of
pontorson
the
of
the
division
hurried
up
with
his
the
wounded
man
was
still
unconscious
but
after
examining
him
the
surgeon
said
oh
this
is
nothing
but
a
simple
cut
it
can
be
sewed
and
in
eight
days
he
will
be
on
his
feet
again
that
was
a
fine
the
wounded
man
wore
a
cloak
and
a
tricolored
belt
with
pistols
and
a
sabre
they
placed
him
on
a
stretcher
and
after
undressing
him
a
bucket
of
water
was
brought
and
the
surgeon
washed
the
wound
as
the
face
began
to
appear
gauvain
studied
it
attentively
has
he
any
papers
about
him
he
asked
the
surgeon
felt
in
his
side
pocket
and
drew
out
a
which
he
handed
to
gauvain
meanwhile
the
wounded
man
revived
by
the
cold
water
was
regaining
his
consciousness
his
eyelids
quivered
slightly
gauvain
was
looking
over
the
in
which
he
discovered
a
sheet
of
paper
folded
four
times
he
opened
it
and
read
committee
of
public
safety
citizen
cimourdain
cimourdain
he
cried
whereupon
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
gauvain
was
beside
himself
it
is
you
cimourdain
for
the
second
time
you
have
saved
my
life
cimourdain
looked
at
gauvain
while
a
sudden
burst
of
joy
impossible
to
describe
lit
up
his
bleeding
face
gauvain
fell
on
his
knees
before
him
exclaiming
my
master
thy
father
said
cimourdain
a
drop
of
cold
water
it
was
many
a
year
since
last
they
met
but
their
hearts
had
never
been
separated
and
they
knew
each
other
again
as
if
they
had
parted
but
yesterday
a
hospital
had
been
improvised
in
the
town
hall
of
dol
and
cimourdain
was
placed
on
a
bed
in
a
small
room
adjoining
the
large
hall
devoted
to
the
other
wounded
men
the
surgeon
who
had
sewed
up
his
wound
put
a
stop
to
all
exciting
conversation
between
the
two
men
considering
it
wiser
to
leave
cimourdain
to
sleep
besides
gauvain
was
called
away
by
the
thousand
duties
and
cares
incident
to
victory
cimourdain
was
left
alone
but
he
could
not
sleep
excited
as
he
was
by
the
double
fever
of
his
wound
and
of
his
joy
he
knew
he
was
not
sleeping
and
yet
he
hardly
felt
sure
that
he
was
awake
could
it
be
possible
that
his
dream
had
come
to
pass
cimourdain
was
one
of
those
men
who
have
no
faith
in
good
luck
and
yet
it
had
fallen
to
his
lot
he
had
found
gauvain
he
had
left
him
a
child
he
found
him
a
man
a
grand
brave
conqueror
and
that
in
the
cause
of
the
people
in
the
vendée
gauvain
was
the
pillar
of
the
revolution
and
it
was
really
cimourdain
himself
who
had
bestowed
this
support
upon
the
republic
this
conqueror
was
his
pupil
cimourdain
beheld
his
own
thought
illumining
the
youthful
countenance
of
this
man
for
whom
a
niche
in
the
republican
pantheon
was
perhaps
reserved
his
disciple
the
child
of
his
mind
was
a
hero
from
this
time
forth
and
would
soon
become
famous
it
seemed
to
cimourdain
like
seeing
his
own
soul
transformed
into
a
genius
as
he
watched
gauvain
in
the
battle
he
had
felt
like
chiron
watching
achilles
there
is
a
certain
analogy
between
the
priest
and
the
centaur
since
a
priest
is
but
half
a
man
the
incidents
of
this
day
adventure
added
to
the
sleeplessness
caused
by
his
wound
filled
cimourdain
with
a
strange
sort
of
intoxication
he
seemed
to
see
a
youthful
destiny
rising
before
him
in
all
its
splendor
and
the
knowledge
of
his
own
absolute
control
of
this
destiny
contributed
to
increase
his
deep
joy
it
needed
but
one
more
triumph
like
that
which
he
had
just
witnessed
and
at
a
word
from
cimourdain
the
republic
would
place
gauvain
at
the
head
of
an
army
nothing
dazzles
one
so
much
as
an
unexpected
success
this
was
the
epoch
of
military
dreams
every
man
had
a
longing
to
create
a
general
westermann
was
the
hero
of
danton
dream
rossignol
of
marat
ronsin
of
hébert
and
robespierre
would
have
liked
to
ruin
them
all
so
why
not
gauvain
cimourdain
asked
himself
and
thereupon
he
proceeded
to
lose
himself
in
dreams
there
were
no
limits
to
his
imaginings
as
he
passed
from
one
hypothesis
to
another
all
obstacles
vanished
before
him
for
this
is
a
ladder
on
which
having
once
set
foot
one
never
pauses
the
ascent
is
a
long
one
starting
from
man
and
ending
at
the
stars
a
great
general
is
only
the
commander
of
an
army
a
great
captain
is
also
a
leader
of
thought
cimourdain
pictured
gauvain
as
a
great
captain
it
seemed
to
him
for
fancies
travel
fast
that
he
saw
him
on
the
sea
pursuing
the
english
on
the
rhine
driving
before
him
the
kings
of
the
north
in
the
pyrenees
repulsing
spain
on
the
alps
setting
the
signal
for
insurrection
before
the
eyes
of
rome
cimourdain
was
a
man
who
possessed
two
distinct
natures
the
one
tender
the
other
gloomy
both
of
which
were
satisfied
for
since
the
inexorable
was
his
ideal
it
gratified
him
to
see
gauvain
at
once
glorious
and
terrible
cimourdain
thought
of
all
he
had
to
pull
down
before
he
could
build
up
and
certainly
he
said
to
himself
this
is
no
time
to
indulge
in
tender
emotions
gauvain
will
be
up
la
an
expression
of
the
day
cimourdain
pictured
gauvain
to
himself
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
girded
in
light
a
flaming
meteor
on
his
brow
spreading
the
grand
ideal
wings
of
justice
right
and
progress
and
like
an
angel
of
extermination
crushing
the
darkness
beneath
his
heel
just
at
the
crisis
of
this
reverie
which
one
might
almost
have
called
an
ecstasy
through
the
door
he
heard
men
talking
in
the
great
adjoining
his
room
and
he
recognized
voice
which
in
spite
of
years
of
absence
had
always
rung
in
his
ears
for
the
voice
of
the
man
often
retains
something
of
its
childish
tones
he
listened
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
and
he
heard
the
soldiers
saying
here
is
the
man
who
fired
at
you
commander
he
had
crawled
into
a
cellar
when
no
one
was
watching
but
we
found
him
and
here
he
is
then
cimourdain
heard
the
following
conversation
between
gauvain
and
the
man
are
you
wounded
i
am
well
enough
to
be
shot
put
this
man
to
bed
dress
his
wounds
take
good
care
of
him
until
he
recovers
i
want
to
die
but
you
are
going
to
live
you
tried
to
kill
me
in
the
name
of
the
king
i
pardon
you
in
the
name
of
the
republic
a
shadow
crossed
cimourdain
brow
he
seemed
to
wake
as
with
a
start
and
whispered
to
himself
in
a
tone
of
gloomy
dejection
yes
he
has
a
merciful
nature
there
can
be
no
doubt
vi
a
healed
breast
but
a
bleeding
heart
a
gash
is
quickly
healed
but
there
was
elsewhere
one
more
seriously
wounded
than
cimourdain
this
was
the
woman
who
had
been
shot
and
whom
the
beggar
tellmarch
had
rescued
from
the
great
pool
of
blood
at
the
farm
michelle
fléchard
was
in
a
more
critical
condition
than
tellmarch
had
supposed
there
was
a
wound
in
the
corresponding
to
that
above
her
breast
one
ball
had
broken
her
while
another
had
entered
her
shoulder
but
as
the
lung
was
uninjured
she
might
recover
tellmarch
was
what
in
peasant
language
is
called
a
philosopher
that
is
to
say
a
combination
of
doctor
surgeon
and
wizard
upon
the
bed
of
seaweed
in
his
underground
den
he
nursed
the
wounded
woman
using
those
mysterious
remedies
called
simples
end
thanks
to
his
care
she
lived
the
knitted
together
the
wounds
in
the
breast
and
the
shoulder
closed
and
after
a
few
weeks
the
wounded
woman
became
convalescent
one
morning
she
was
able
to
walk
out
of
the
leaning
on
tellmarch
she
seated
herself
under
the
trees
in
the
sun
tellmarch
knew
very
little
about
her
for
a
wound
in
the
breast
necessitates
silence
and
during
the
agony
which
preceded
her
recovery
she
had
hardly
spoken
a
word
whenever
she
seemed
about
to
open
her
lips
tellmarch
would
prevent
her
but
he
could
not
control
her
thoughts
and
he
observed
by
the
expression
in
her
eyes
the
nature
of
her
fancies
this
morning
she
felt
strong
and
could
almost
walk
alone
the
doctor
who
has
cured
his
patient
enjoys
a
sense
of
fatherhood
and
as
he
watched
her
tellmarch
felt
happy
the
good
old
man
began
to
smile
as
he
addressed
her
well
it
seems
we
are
up
our
wounds
are
healed
all
but
those
of
the
heart
and
presently
she
added
then
you
do
know
where
they
are
whom
do
you
mean
asked
tellmarch
my
children
the
word
then
revealed
a
whole
world
of
meaning
it
seemed
to
say
since
you
do
not
speak
of
them
to
me
since
you
have
been
with
me
for
so
many
days
without
opening
your
lips
to
me
on
the
subject
since
you
silence
me
every
time
i
try
to
speak
since
you
seem
to
fear
that
i
am
going
to
talk
about
them
it
must
mean
that
you
have
nothing
to
tell
me
during
the
course
of
her
fever
she
had
often
noticed
that
whenever
in
her
delirious
ramblings
she
had
called
for
her
children
the
perceptions
of
delirium
are
sometimes
acute
the
old
man
would
make
no
reply
the
truth
was
that
tellmarch
did
not
know
what
to
tell
her
it
is
not
easy
to
speak
to
a
mother
of
her
lost
children
and
besides
what
did
he
know
nothing
at
all
in
fact
that
a
mother
had
been
shot
that
he
had
found
this
mother
on
the
ground
that
when
he
had
lifted
her
up
she
was
nearly
dead
that
this
dying
woman
had
three
children
and
lastly
that
the
marquis
de
lantenac
after
ordering
the
mother
to
be
shot
had
carried
away
the
children
and
here
his
information
ceased
what
had
become
of
the
children
were
they
still
living
having
made
inquiries
he
had
learned
that
there
were
two
boys
and
a
little
girl
barely
weaned
and
this
was
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
he
asked
himself
more
questions
than
he
could
answer
in
regard
to
this
unhappy
family
but
the
neighbors
whom
he
had
asked
only
shook
their
heads
de
lantenac
was
a
man
of
whom
no
one
cared
to
talk
they
were
equally
reluctant
either
to
speak
about
lantenac
or
to
talk
to
tellmarch
peasants
have
their
own
peculiar
superstitions
they
disliked
tellmarch
tellmarch
le
caimand
was
a
perplexing
man
why
was
he
always
looking
up
at
the
sky
what
was
he
doing
what
could
he
be
thinking
about
when
he
stood
motionless
for
hours
at
a
time
surely
he
must
be
a
very
odd
sort
of
man
while
the
district
was
in
a
state
of
combustion
and
conflagration
when
warfare
devastation
and
carnage
were
the
sole
occupations
of
life
when
every
man
was
doing
his
best
to
burn
houses
murder
families
massacre
outposts
and
plunder
villages
thinking
of
nothing
but
setting
ambushes
and
traps
and
killing
one
another
here
was
this
hermit
absorbed
in
nature
enjoying
absolute
peace
of
mind
gathering
plants
and
herbs
interested
only
in
flowers
birds
and
stars
of
course
he
was
a
dangerous
character
he
must
be
insane
he
never
hid
behind
a
bush
to
fire
at
his
the
man
is
mad
said
the
hence
he
inspired
a
certain
awe
and
men
avoided
him
thus
increasing
the
isolation
of
his
life
illustration
they
asked
him
no
questions
and
seldom
vouchsafed
replies
therefore
he
had
been
unable
to
get
the
information
he
wanted
the
conflict
had
been
transferred
to
other
districts
and
the
fighting
was
more
remote
the
marquis
de
lantenac
had
vanished
from
the
horizon
and
war
must
set
its
foot
on
a
man
of
tellmarch
character
before
he
becomes
aware
of
its
existence
after
hearing
these
words
my
children
tellmarch
ceased
to
smile
and
the
mother
sank
into
deep
thought
what
was
passing
in
her
soul
she
seemed
to
have
plunged
into
the
depths
suddenly
she
looked
up
at
tellmarch
and
repeated
her
demand
almost
angrily
my
children
tellmarch
bent
his
head
like
a
culprit
he
was
thinking
of
the
marquis
de
lantenac
who
so
far
from
returning
his
thought
had
probably
forgotten
his
very
existence
he
realized
the
fact
as
he
said
to
himself
when
a
nobleman
is
in
danger
he
reckons
you
among
his
acquaintance
but
let
the
danger
pass
and
he
forgets
that
he
ever
saw
you
and
he
asked
himself
why
then
did
i
save
him
to
which
question
he
made
reply
because
he
was
a
man
for
some
moments
he
dwelt
upon
this
thought
then
he
resumed
the
thread
of
his
meditations
am
i
sure
of
this
and
presently
he
repeated
those
bitter
words
had
i
but
known
this
whole
experience
gave
him
a
sense
of
oppression
for
his
own
action
in
the
affair
was
enigmatical
to
him
his
thoughts
were
sad
since
a
sense
of
guilt
had
crept
into
them
a
kindly
act
may
prove
in
the
end
to
have
been
an
evil
one
he
who
saves
the
wolf
kills
the
sheep
he
who
sets
the
vulture
wing
is
responsible
for
his
talons
the
unreasoning
anger
of
this
mother
was
therefore
justified
still
he
felt
a
certain
consolation
in
the
knowledge
that
he
had
saved
the
mother
which
partly
balanced
his
regret
for
having
saved
the
marquis
but
the
children
the
mother
was
also
thinking
and
these
two
currents
of
thoughts
moved
side
by
side
perhaps
to
mingle
unawares
in
the
shadowy
land
of
reverie
meanwhile
her
eyes
gloomy
as
the
night
rested
again
on
tellmarch
we
can
not
go
on
like
this
she
said
hush
rejoined
tellmarch
putting
his
finger
on
his
lips
she
continued
i
am
angry
with
you
for
saving
me
you
did
wrong
i
would
rather
have
died
for
then
i
should
surely
see
them
and
know
where
they
are
they
would
not
see
me
but
i
should
be
near
them
the
dead
must
have
power
to
protect
he
took
her
by
the
arm
and
felt
her
pulse
you
must
calm
yourself
or
you
will
have
a
relapse
she
asked
him
almost
harshly
when
can
i
go
away
go
away
yes
when
shall
i
be
fit
for
tramping
never
if
you
are
unreasonable
if
you
are
good
what
do
you
call
being
good
trusting
in
god
god
what
has
he
done
with
my
children
she
seemed
to
be
wandering
her
voice
had
grown
very
gentle
you
must
see
she
went
on
to
say
that
i
can
not
stay
like
this
you
never
had
any
children
but
i
am
a
mother
that
makes
a
difference
one
can
not
judge
of
a
thing
unless
he
knows
what
it
is
like
did
you
ever
have
any
children
no
replied
tellmarch
but
i
have
can
i
live
without
my
children
i
should
like
to
be
told
why
my
children
are
not
here
something
is
happening
but
what
it
is
i
can
not
understand
come
said
tellmarch
you
are
feverish
again
you
must
talk
any
more
she
looked
at
him
and
was
silent
and
from
that
day
she
kept
silence
again
this
implicit
obedience
was
more
than
tellmarch
desired
she
spent
hour
after
hour
crouching
at
the
foot
of
the
old
tree
like
one
stupefied
she
pondered
in
silence
that
refuge
of
simple
souls
who
have
sounded
the
gloomy
depths
of
woe
she
seemed
to
give
up
trying
to
understand
after
a
certain
point
despair
becomes
unintelligible
to
the
despairing
as
tellmarch
watched
her
his
sympathy
increased
the
sight
of
her
suffering
excited
in
this
old
man
thoughts
such
as
a
woman
might
have
known
she
may
close
her
lips
he
said
to
himself
but
her
eyes
will
speak
and
i
see
what
ails
her
she
has
but
one
idea
she
can
not
be
resigned
to
the
thought
that
she
is
no
longer
a
mother
her
mind
dwells
constantly
on
the
image
of
her
youngest
whom
she
was
nursing
not
long
ago
how
charming
it
must
be
to
feel
a
tiny
rosy
mouth
drawing
ones
soul
from
out
one
body
feeding
its
own
little
life
on
the
life
of
its
mother
he
too
was
silent
realizing
the
impotence
of
speech
in
the
presence
of
such
sorrow
there
is
something
really
terrible
in
the
silence
of
an
unchanging
thought
and
how
can
one
expect
that
a
mother
will
listen
to
reason
maternity
sees
but
one
side
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
it
one
sublime
characteristic
of
a
mother
is
her
resemblance
to
a
wild
animal
the
maternal
instinct
is
divine
animalism
the
mother
ceases
to
be
a
woman
she
becomes
a
female
and
her
children
are
her
cubs
hence
we
find
in
the
mother
something
above
reason
and
at
the
same
time
below
it
a
something
which
we
call
instinct
guided
as
she
is
by
the
infinite
and
mysterious
will
of
the
universe
her
very
blindness
is
charged
with
penetration
however
anxious
to
make
this
unfortunate
woman
speak
tellmarch
could
not
succeed
one
day
he
said
to
her
unfortunately
i
am
old
and
can
no
longer
walk
my
strength
is
exhausted
before
i
reach
my
journey
end
i
would
go
with
you
only
that
my
legs
give
out
in
about
fifteen
minutes
and
i
have
to
stop
and
rest
however
it
may
be
just
as
well
for
you
that
i
can
not
walk
far
as
my
company
might
be
more
dangerous
than
useful
here
i
am
tolerated
but
the
blues
suspect
me
because
i
am
a
peasant
and
the
peasants
because
they
believe
me
to
be
a
wizard
he
waited
for
an
answer
but
she
did
not
even
raise
her
eyes
a
fixed
idea
ends
either
in
madness
or
heroism
but
what
heroism
can
be
expected
from
a
poor
peasant
woman
none
whatever
she

that
is
all
each
day
she
grew
more
and
more
absorbed
in
her
reverie
tellmarch
was
watching
her
he
tried
to
keep
her
busy
he
bought
her
needles
thread
and
a
thimble
and
to
the
delight
of
the
poor
caimand
she
really
began
to
busy
herself
with
sewing
she
still
dreamed
it
is
true
but
she
worked
also
a
sure
sign
of
health
and
by
degrees
her
strength
returned
she
mended
her
underwear
her
dress
and
her
shoes
her
eyes
all
the
while
preserving
a
strange
look
as
she
sewed
she
hummed
to
herself
unintelligible
songs
she
would
mutter
names
probably
children
names
but
not
distinctly
enough
for
tellmarch
to
understand
sometimes
she
paused
and
listened
to
the
birds
as
though
she
expected
a
message
from
them
she
watched
the
weather
and
he
could
see
her
lips
move
as
she
talked
to
herself
in
a
low
voice
she
had
made
a
bag
and
filled
it
with
chestnuts
and
one
morning
tellmarch
found
her
gazing
vaguely
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
he
saw
that
she
was
all
ready
to
start
where
are
you
going

asked
and
she
replied
i
am
going
to
look
for

the
two
poles
of
truth
after
a
few
weeks
crowded
with
the
vicissitudes
of
civil
war
throughout
the
district
of
fougères
the
talk
ran
for
the
most
part
upon
two
men
wholly
unlike
in
character
who
were
nevertheless
engaged
in
the
same
work
fighting
side
by
side
in
the
great
revolutionary
struggle
the
savage
duel
still
continued
but
the
vendée
was
losing
ground
especially
in
where
thanks
to
the
young
commander
who
at
dol
had
so
opportunely
confronted
the
audacity
of
six
thousand
royalists
with
that
of
fifteen
hundred
patriots
the
insurrection
if
not
suppressed
was
at
least
far
less
active
and
restricted
to
certain
limits
several
successful
attacks
had
followed
that
exploit
and
from
these
repeated
victories
a
new
state
of
affairs
had
sprung
into
existence
matters
had
assumed
a
different
aspect
but
a
singular
complication
had
arisen
that
the
republic
was
in
the
ascendant
throughout
this
region
of
the
vendée
was
beyond
a
doubt
but
which
republic
amidst
the
dawning
of
triumph
two
republics
confronted
each
other
that
of
terror
determined
to
conquer
by
severity
and
that
of
mercy
striving
to
win
the
victory
by
mildness
which
was
to
prevail
the
visible
representatives
of
these
two
forms
one
of
which
was
conciliatory
and
the
other
implacable
were
two
men
each
possessing
influence
and
authority
one
a
military
commander
the
other
a
civil
delegate
which
of
the
two
would
win
the
day
the
delegate
was
supported
by
a
tremendous
influence
he
came
bringing
with
him
the
threatening
watchword
from
the
paris
commune
to
the
battalion
of
santerre
no
mercy
no
quarter
as
a
means
of
compelling
implicit
obedience
to
his
authority
he
had
the
decree
of
the
convention
reading
as
follows
penalty
of
death
to
whomsoever
shall
set
at
liberty
or
connive
at
the
escape
of
a
rebel
chief
and
also
full
powers
from
the
committee
of
public
safety
with
an
injunction
commanding
obedience
to
him
as
a
delegate
signed
by
robespierre
danton
and
marat
the
soldier
for
his
part
had
but
the
power
that
is
born
of
pity
his
weapons
of
defence
were
his
right
arm
to
chastise
the
enemy
and
his
heart
to
pardon
them
as
a
conqueror
he
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
spare
the
conquered
hence
a
conflict
deep
but
as
yet
unacknowledged
between
these
two
men
they
lived
in
different
atmospheres
both
wrestling
with
rebellion
the
one
armed
with
the
thunderbolts
of
victory
the
other
with
those
of
terror
throughout
the
bocage
men
talked
of
nothing
else
and
the
extreme
intimacy
of
two
men
of
such
utterly
opposite
natures
contributed
to
increase
the
anxiety
of
those
who
were
watching
them
on
every
side
these
two
antagonists
were
friends
never
were
two
hearts
drawn
together
by
a
deeper
or
a
nobler
sympathy
the
man
of
ungentle
nature
had
saved
the
life
of
him
who
was
merciful
the
scar
on
his
face
bore
witness
to
the
fact
these
men
represented
in
their
own
persons
the
images
of
death
and
of
life
embodying
the
principle
of
destruction
and
that
of
peace
and
they
loved
each
other
conceive
if
you
can
orestes
merciful
and
pylades
pitiless
try
to
imagine
arimanes
the
brother
of
ormus
let
us
also
add
that
of
these
two
men
the
one
who
was
called
ferocious
showed
himself
at
the
same
time
the
most
brotherly
of
men
he
dressed
wounds
nursed
the
sick
spent
his
days
and
nights
in
the
ambulances
and
hospitals
took
pity
on
the
barefooted
children
kept
nothing
for
himself
but
gave
all
he
had
to
the
poor
he
never
missed
a
battle
always
marching
at
the
head
of
the
columns
was
ever
in
the
thickest
of
the
fight
armed
it
is
true
for
he
always
wore
in
his
belt
a
sabre
and
two
pistols
yet
practically
unarmed
for
no
one
had
ever
seen
him
draw
his
sword
or
raise
his
pistols
he
faced
blows
but
never
returned
them
it
was
said
that
he
had
been
a
priest
these
two
men
were
gauvain
and
cimourdain
at
variance
in
principles
though
united
in
friendship
it
was
like
a
soul
cleft
in
twain
and
gauvain
had
in
truth
received
the
gentler
half
of
cimourdain
nature
one
might
say
that
the
latter
has
bestowed
the
white
ray
upon
gauvain
and
kept
the
black
one
for
himself
hence
a
secret
discord
sooner
or
later
this
suppressed
disagreement
could
hardly
fail
to
explode
and
one
morning
the
contest
began
as
follows
cimourdain
said
to
gauvain
what
have
we
accomplished
to
which
the
latter
replied
you
know
as
well
as
i
have
dispersed
lantenac
bands
he
has
but
a
few
men
left
and
has
been
driven
to
the
forest
of
fougères
in
eight
days
he
will
be
surrounded
and
in
fifteen
he
will
be
captured
and
then
you
have
seen
my
notice
yes
and
what
then
he
is
to
be
shot
a
truce
to
clemency
he
must
be
guillotined
i
approve
of
a
military
death
and
i
of
a
revolutionary
one
looking
gauvain
full
in
the
face
cimourdain
said
why
did
you
order
those
nuns
of
the
convent
of
to
be
set
at
liberty
i
do
not
wage
war
against
women
replied
gauvain
those
women
hate
the
people
and
when
there
is
a
question
of
hatred
one
woman
is
equal
to
ten
men
why
did
you
refuse
to
send
that
band
of
fanatical
old
priests
whom
you
took
at
louvigné
before
the
revolutionary
tribunal
neither
do
i
wage
war
against
old
men
an
old
priest
is
worse
than
a
young
one
the
rebellion
that
is
advocated
by
white
hair
is
so
much
the
more
dangerous
people
have
faith
in
wrinkles
do
not
indulge
in
false
pity
gauvain
the
regicide
is
the
true
liberator
keep
your
eye
on
the
tower
of
the
temple
the
temple
tower
i
would
have
the
dauphin
out
of
it
i
am
not
making
war
against
children
cimourdain
eye
grew
stern
learn
then
gauvain
that
one
must
make
war
on
a
woman
when
her
name
is
on
an
old
man
if
he
happens
to
be
pope
pius
and
upon
a
child
who
goes
by
the
name
of
louis
capet
i
am
no
politician
master
try
then
not
to
be
a
dangerous
man
why
was
it
that
during
the
attack
of
the
post
of
cossé
when
the
rebel
jean
treton
repulsed
and
defeated
rushed
alone
sabre
in
hand
against
your
entire
division
you
cried
the
ranks
let
him
pass
through
because
it
is
not
fit
that
fifteen
hundred
men
should
be
allowed
to
kill
one
man
and
why
at
cailleterie
when
you
saw
that
your
soldiers
were
about
to
kill
the
vendean
joseph
bézier
who
was
wounded
and
just
able
to
drag
himself
along
did
you
cry
leave
this
man
to
me
and
directly
afterwards
fire
your
pistol
in
the
air
because
one
shrinks
from
killing
a
fallen
enemy
there
you
were
wrong
both
of
these
men
are
leaders
at
this
present
moment
joseph
bézier
is
known
as
moustache
and
jean
treton
as
by
saving
their
lives
you
presented
the
republic
with
two
enemies
illustration
i
should
prefer
to
make
friends
for
her
rather
than
enemies
after
the
victory
of
landéan
why
did
you
not
shoot
the
three
hundred
peasant
prisoners
because
bonchamp
pardoned
the
republican
prisoners
and
i
wished
it
to
be
known
that
the
republic
pardons
the
royalist
prisoners
then
i
suppose
you
will
pardon
lantenac
if
you
take
him
no
why
not
since
you
pardoned
three
hundred
peasants
the
peasants
are
only
ignorant
men
lantenac
knows
what
he
is
about
but
lantenac
is
your
kinsman
and
france
nearer
than
he
lantenac
is
an
old
man
to
me
lantenac
is
a
stranger
he
has
no
age
he
is
ready
to
summon
the
english
he
represents
invasion
he
is
the
country
enemy
and
the
duel
between
us
can
only
be
ended
by
his
death
or
mine
remember
these
words
gauvain
i
have
said
them
for
a
while
both
men
remained
silent
gazing
at
each
other
then
gauvain
continued
this
will
be
a
bloody
year
this
tate
care
cried
cimourdain
there
are
terrible
duties
to
be
performed
and
we
must
beware
of
accusing
the
innocent
instrument
how
long
since
we
have
blamed
the
doctor
for
his
patient
illness
yes
the
chief
characteristic
of
this
stupendous
year
is
its
pitiless
severity
and
why
is
this
because
it
is
the
great
revolutionary
year
the
year
which
is
the
very
incarnation
of
revolution
revolution
feels
no
more
pity
for
its
enemy
the
old
world
than
the
surgeon
feels
for
the
gangrene
against
which
he
is
fighting
the
business
of
revolution
is
to
extirpate
royalty
in
the
person
of
the
king
aristocracy
in
that
of
the
nobleman
despotism
in
that
of
the
soldier
and
superstition
and
barbarism
in
the
persons
of
the
priest
and
the
judge
in
one
word
of
every
form
of
tyranny
in
the
image
of
the
tyrant
the
operation
is
a
fearful
one
but
revolution
performs
it
with
a
steady
hand
as
to
the
amount
of
sound
flesh
that
must
be
sacrificed
ask
a
boerhave
what
he
thinks
of
it
do
you
suppose
it
possible
to
remove
a
tumor
without
loss
of
blood
can
a
conflagration
be
extinguished
without
violent
efforts
these
terrible
necessities
are
the
very
condition
of
success
a
surgeon
may
be
compared
to
a
butcher
or
a
healer
may
seem
like
an
executioner
revolution
is
devoted
to
its
fatal
work
it
mutilates
that
it
may
save
what
can
you
expect
it
to
take
pity
on
the
virus
would
you
have
it
merciful
to
poison
it
will
not
listen
it
holds
the
past
within
its
grasp
and
it
means
to
make
an
end
of
it
it
cuts
deeply
into
civilization
that
it
may
promote
the
health
of
mankind
you
suffer
no
doubt
but
consider
for
how
short
a
time
it
will
endure
only
so
long
as
the
operation
requires
and
after
that
is
over
you
will
live
revolution
is
amputating
the
world
hence
this
hemorrhage
a
surgeon
is
calm
said
gauvain
and
the
men
i
see
are
violent
revolution
requires
the
aid
of
savage
workmen
replied
cimourdain
it
repulses
all
trembling
hands
it
trusts
only
such
as
are
inexorable
danton
is
the
impersonation
of
the
terrible
robespierre
of
the
inflexible
of
the
immovable
and
marat
of
the
implacable
take
note
of
it
gauvain
we
need
these
names
they
are
worth
as
much
as
armies
to
us
they
will
terrify
europe
and
possibly
the
future
also
replied
gauvain
he
paused
and
then
continued
but
really
master
you
are
mistaken
i
accuse
no
one
my
idea
of
revolution
is
that
it
shall
be
irresponsible
we
ought
not
to
say
this
man
is
innocent
or
that
one
is
guilty
louis
xvi
is
like
a
sheep
cast
among
lions
he
wishes
to
escape
and
in
trying
to
defend
himself
he
would
bite
if
he
could
but
one
can
not
turn
into
a
lion
at
will
his
weakness
is
regarded
as
a
crime
and
when
the
angry
sheep
shows
his
teeth
the
traitor
cry
the
lions
and
they
proceed
straightway
to
devour
him
and
afterwards
fall
to
fighting
among
themselves
the
sheep
is
a
brute
and
what
are
the
lions
this
answer
set
cimourdain
thinking
the
lions
he
replied
represent
the
human
conscience
principles
ideas
it
is
they
who
have
caused
the
reign
of
terror
some
day
the
revolution
will
justify
all
that
take
care
lest
terror
should
prove
the
calumny
of
the
revolution
gauvain
continued
liberty
equality
fraternity
these
are
the
dogmas
of
peace
and
harmony
why
give
them
so
terrible
an
aspect
what
are
we
striving
to
accomplish
to
bring
all
nations
under
one
universal
republic
well
then
let
us
not
terrify
them
of
what
use
is
intimidation
neither
nations
nor
birds
can
be
attracted
by
fear
we
must
not
do
evil
that
good
may
come
we
have
not
overturned
the
throne
to
leave
the
scaffold
standing
death
to
the
king
and
life
to
the
nations
let
us
strike
off
the
crowns
but
spare
the
heads
revolution
means
concord
and
not
terror
schemes
of
benevolence
are
but
poorly
served
by
merciless
men
amnesty
is
to
me
the
grandest
word
in
human
language
i
am
opposed
to
the
shedding
of
blood
save
as
i
risk
my
own
still
i
am
but
a
soldier
i
can
do
no
more
than
fight
yet
if
we
are
to
lose
the
privilege
of
pardoning
of
what
use
is
it
to
conquer
let
us
be
enemies
if
you
will
in
battle
but
when
victory
is
ours
then
is
the
time
to
be
brothers
take
care
repeated
cimourdain
for
the
third
time
take
care
gauvain
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
a
son
and
he
added
thoughtfully
in
times
like
these
pity
may
be
nothing
less
than
treason
in
another
form
listening
to
these
two
men
one
might
have
fancied
himself
hearing
a
dialogue
between
a
sword
and
all

meanwhile
the
mother
was
searching
for
her
little
ones
walking
straight
onward
and
how
she
subsisted
we
can
not
tell
since
she
did
not
know
herself
she
walked
day
and
night
begging
as
she
went
often
living
on
herbs

sleeping
upon
the
ground
in
the
open

among
the
bushes
under
the
stars

sometimes
mid

the

thus
she
wandered
from
village
to

from
farm
to

making
inquiries
as
she
went
along

tattered
and
torn
as
she
was
never
venturing
beyond
the
threshold
sometimes
she
found
a
welcome
sometimes
she
was
turned
away

when
they
refused
to

her
come
in

would
go
into

woods
unfamiliar
as
she
was
with
the
country
beyond
siscoignard
and
the
parish
of
azé
and
having
nothing
to
serve
as
guide
she
would
retrace
her
steps
going
over
and
over
the
same
ground
thus
wasting
both
time
and
strength
sometimes
she
followed
the
highway
sometimes
the
and
then
again
she
would
turn
into
the
paths
in
the
woods
in
this
wandering
life
she
had
worn
out
her
wretched
garments
at
first
she
had
her
shoes
then
she
went
barefoot

it
was
not

before
her

she
travelled
on

bloodshed

and
that
was
all
perceiving
that
she
was
not
understood
she
would
explain
it
is
because
they
are
mine
that
is
the
reason
and
then
seeing
the
continue
their
way
she
would
stand
speechless
tearing
her
breast
with
her
nails
one
day
however
a
peasant
stopped
to
listen
to
her
the
worthy
man
set
his
wits
at
work
let
us
see
did
you
say
three
children
he
asked
yes
two
boys
and
a
girl
and
you
are
looking
for
them
yes
i
was
told
that
a
nobleman
had
carried
off
three
little
children
and
keeps
them
with
him
where
is
that
man
where
are
they
she
cried
yon
must
go
to
the
tourgue
answered
the
peasant
and
shall
i
find
my
children
there
very
likely
you
will
what
did
you
say
the
name
was
the
tourgue
what
is
the
tourgue
it
is
a
place
is
it
a
village
a
castle
or
a
farm
i
never
was
there
is
it
far
i
should
say
so
in
what
direction
in
the
direction
of
fougères
which
way
shall
i
go
you
are
now
at
ventortes
replied
the
peasant
you
will
leave
ernée
on
your
left
and
coxelles
on
your
right
you
must
pass
through
longchamps
and
cross
the
leroux
the
peasant
raised
his
hand
and
pointed
westward
keep
straight
ahead
facing
the
sunset
she
had
already
started
before
he
had
time
to
lower
his
arm
he
called
out
to
her
you
must
be
careful
they
are
fighting
over
there
she
never
turned
to
reply
but
walked
straight
ahead
without
pausing

i
la
tourgue
the
traveller
who
forty
years
ago
entered
the
forest
of
fougères
from
the
direction
of
laignelet
and
came
out
towards
parigné
might
have
beheld
on
the
edge
of
this
dense
forest
a
sinister
sight
for
emerging
from
the
thicket
he
would
come
directly
upon
the
tourgue
and
not
the
living
tourgue
but
the
dead
one
the
tourgue
cracked
battered
scarred
dismantled
a
ruin
may
be
called
the
ghost
of
an
edifice
nothing
could
be
more
lugubrious
than
the
aspect
of
the
tourgue
a
high
circular
tower
stood
alone
like
a
malefactor
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
rising
as
it
did
from
a
precipitous
rock
its
severe
and
solid
architecture
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
roman
structure
combining
within
itself
the
elements
of
power
and
of
decay
in
fact
it
might
in
one
sense
be
called
roman
since
it
was
romance
it
was
begun
in
the
ninth
century
and
finished
in
the
twelfth
after
the
time
of
the
third
crusade
the
style
of
the
imposts
of
its
embrasures
indicated
its
period
if
one
approached
it
and
cared
to
climb
the
slope
he
might
perceive
a
breach
in
the
wall
and
if
he
ventured
to
enter
in
he
would
find
a
vacant
space
and
nothing
more
it
was
not
unlike
the
inside
of
a
stone
trumpet
set
upright
on
the
ground
from
top
to
bottom
there
were
no
partitions
and
neither
ceilings
nor
floors
here
and
there
arches
and
chimneys
had
evidently
been
torn
away
and
falconet
embrasures
were
still
seen
at
different
heights
rows
of
granite
corbels
and
a
few
covered
with
the
ordure
of
the
night
birds
marked
the
separate
stories
a
colossal
wall
fifteen
feet
thick
at
its
base
and
twelve
at
its
summit
cracks
here
and
there
and
holes
which
once
were
doors
and
through
which
one
caught
glimpses
of
staircases
within
the
gloomy
walls
one
who
passing
by
at
evening
might
venture
in
would
hear
the
cry
of
the
the
and
the
would
find
brambles
stones
and
reptiles
beneath
his
feet
and
overhead
through
a
dark
circular
opening
at
the
top
of
the
tower
which
looked
like
the
mouth
of
an
enormous
well
he
might
see
the
stars
local
tradition
relates
that
there
were
secret
doors
in
the
upper
stories
of
this
tower
like
those
in
the
tombs
of
the
kings
of
judah
composed
of
one
large
stone
turning
on
a
pivot
which
when
closed
could
not
be
distinguished
from
the
wall
itself
a
fashion
in
architecture
brought
home
by
the
crusaders
together
with
the
pointed
arch
when
these
doors
were
closed
it
was
impossible
to
discover
them
so
skilfully
were
they
fitted
into
the
rest
of
the
stones
such
doors
can
be
found
in
those
mysterious
libyan
cities
which
escaped
the
earthquakes
that
buried
the
twelve
cities
in
the
time
of
tiberius
ii
the
breach
the
breach
by
which
one
gained
access
to
the
ruin
was
the
opening
of
a
mine
a
connoisseur
familiar
with
errard
sardi
and
pagan
would
have
appreciated
the
skill
with
which
this
mine
was
planned
the
in
the
shape
of
a
biretta
was
of
a
size
accurately
proportioned
to
the
strength
of
the
keep
which
it
was
intended
to
destroy
it
was
capable
of
containing
at
least
two
of
powder
the
winding
passage
which
led
to
it
was
more
effective
than
a
straight
one
the
saucisse
laid
bare
among
the
broken
stones
as
the
result
of
the
crumbling
caused
by
the
mine

seen
to
have
the
requisite
diameter
of
a
the
explosion
had
made
a
deep
rent
in
the
wall
by
which
the
assailants
were
enabled
to
enter
it
was
evident
that
this
tower
must
have
sustained
formal
sieges
from
time
to
time
it
was
riddled
with
balls
and
these
were
not
all
of
the
same
epoch
every
missile
has
its
own
special
way
of
marking
a
rampart
and
each
one
from
the
stone
bullets
of
the
fourteenth
century
to
the
iron
ones
of
the
eighteenth
had
left
a
scar
upon
this
the
breach
opened
into
what
must
have
been
the
and
directly
opposite
in
the
wall
of
the
tower
was
the
gateway
of
a
crypt
cut
in
the
rock
and
extending
under
the
hall
of
the
lower
floor
throughout
the
foundation
of
the
tower
this
crypt
filled
up
was
cleared
out
in
under
the
direction
of

iii
the
oubliette
this
crypt
was
the
oubliette
every
keep
possessed
one
and
this
like
many
other
penal
dungeons
of
the
same
period
had
two
stories
the
first
story
accessible
through
the
gate
consisted
of
a
vaulted
chamber
on
a
level
with
the
hall
of
the
on
the
walls
of
this
room
might
be
seen
two
vertical
furrows
parallel
with
each
other
reaching
from
wall
to
wall
and
passing
along
the
vault
where
they
had
left
a
deep
rut
reminding
one
of
and
such
in
fact
they
were
for
these
two
furrows
were
hollowed
out
by
two
wheels
in
old
feudal
times
men
had
been
torn
limb
from
limb
here
in
this
very
room
by
a
process
less
noisy
than
that
of
being
drawn
and
quartered
they
had
a
pair
of
wheels
so
large
and
powerful
that
they
filled
the
entire
room
touching
both
walls
and
ceiling
and
to
each
wheel
was
attached
an
arm
and
a
leg
of
the
victim
and
when
these
wheels
were
turned
in
opposite
directions
the
man
was
torn
asunder
it
required
great
power
hence
the
ruts
worn
in
the
stone
by
the
grazing
of
the
wheels
a
room
of
this
kind
may
be
seen
at
vianden
illustration
above
this
room
there
was
another
the
actual
oubliette
whose
only
entrance
was
a
hole
which
served
the
purpose
of
a
door
the
victim
stripped
of
his
clothes
was
let
down
by
means
of
a
rope
tied
under
his
armpits
into
the
room
below
through
an
opening
made
in
the
middle
of
the
flagging
of
the
upper
room
if
he
persisted
in
living
food
was
thrown
to
him
through
this
aperture
a
similar
hole
may
still
be
seen
at
bouillon
this
chamber
below
excavated
under
the
hall
of
the
to
such
a
depth
that
it
reached
water
and
constantly
swept
by
an
icy
wind
was
more
like
a
well
than
a
room
but
the
wind
so
fatal
to
the
prisoner
in
the
depths
was
on
the
other
hand
favorable
to
the
one
overhead
groping
about
beneath
the
vault
who
could
breathe
the
easier
on
account
of
it
indeed
all
the
air
he
had
came
up
through
this
hole
but
then
any
man
who
entered
or
rather
fell
into
this
tomb
never
came
out
again
it
behooved
the
prisoner
to
look
out
for
himself
in
the
darkness
for
it
needed
but
one
false
step
to
change
the
scene
of
his
sufferings
that
however
was
his
own
affair
if
he
were
tenacious
of
life
this
hole
was
his
danger
but
if
he
were
weary
of
it
it
was
his
resource
the
upper
story
was
the
dungeon
the
lower
one
the
tomb
a
superposition
not
unlike
that
of
the
society
of
the
period
this
is
what
our
ancestors
called
a
but
since
the
thing
itself
has
disappeared
the
name
has
no
longer
any
meaning
for
us
thanks
to
the
revolution
we
can
listen
with
indifference
to
the
sound
of
these
words
on
the
outside
of
the
tower
and
above
the
breach
which
forty
years
ago
was
its
only
entrance
might
be
seen
an
embrasure
somewhat
wider
than
the
other
loopholes
from
which
hung
an
iron
grating
loosened
and
broken
iv
the
a
stone
bridge
whose
three
arches
were
but
slightly
damaged
was
connected
with
this
tower
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
breach
this
bridge
had
once
supported
a
building
whose
few
remaining
fragments
bore
the
traces
of
a
conflagration
it
was
only
the
framework
that
was
left
standing
and
as
the
light
shone
through
its
interstices
as
it
rose
side
by
side
with
the
tower
it
had
the
effect
of
a
skeleton
beside
a
phantom
this
ruin
is
utterly
demolished
leaving
no
trace
whatever
behind
a
single
peasant
can
destroy
in
one
day
structures
that
kings
have
labored
for
centuries
to
erect
la
tourgue
a
peasant
abbreviation
signifies
la
just
as
la
jupelle
stands
for
la
jupellière
and
pinson
le
tort
the
name
of
a
hunchback
leader
for
pinson
le
tortu
la
tourgue
which
even
forty
years
ago
was
a
ruin
and
which
is
but
a
shadow
was
a
fortress
in
it
was
the
old
bastile
of
the
gauvains
and
served
to
guard
towards
the
west
the
entrance
of
the
forest
of
fougères
which
is
now
little
more
than
a
grove
this
fortress
was
built
on
one
of
those
great
blocks
of
slate
which
are
found
in
abundance
between
mayence
and
dinan
scattered
in
all
directions
among
the
copses
and
along
the
heath
like
the
missiles
of
some
titanic
combat
the
tower
composed
the
entire
fortress
and
below
the
tower
stood
the
rock
at
whose
base
flowed
one
of
those
which
swells
into
a
torrent
in
january
and
dries
up
in
june
simple
as
were
its
means
of
defence
this
tower
was
almost
impregnable
in
the
middle
ages
but
the
bridge
had
proved
a
source
of
weakness
the
gauvains
of
gothic
times
had
built
it
without
a
bridge
it
was
formerly
accessible
by
means
of
one
of
those
swinging
bridges
that
could
be
instantly
severed
by
the
stroke
of
an
axe
so
long
as
the
gauvains
remained
viscounts
it
pleased
them
just
as
it
was
and
they
were
satisfied
with
it
but
when
they
became
marquises
and
exchanged
the
keep
for
the
court
they
spanned
the
stream
with
three
arches
and
thus
offered
access
in
the
direction
of
the
plain
very
much
as
they
had
yielded
to
the
advances
of
the
king
the
marquises
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
marchionesses
of
the
seventeenth
no
longer
prided
themselves
on
their
impregnability
they
abandoned
the
traditions
of
their
ancestors
to
follow
the
fashions
of
versailles
facing
the
tower
towards
the
west
was
a
somewhat
elevated
plateau
adjoining
two
plains
this
plateau
was
very
near
the
tower
only
separated
from
it
by
a
deep
ravine
through
which
flowed
a
stream
tributary
to
the
couesnon
the
bridge
that
connected
the
fortress
with
the
plateau
stood
on
lofty
piles
and
on
these
piles
was
constructed
as
at
chenonceaux
a
building
in
the
mansard
style
of
architecture
but
more
comfortable
than
the
tower
customs
were
still
very
rude
and
the
lords
continued
to
occupy
chambers
in
the
keep
that
were
more
like
dungeons
than
bedrooms
as
to
the
building
on
the
bridge
which
was
a
diminutive
kind
of
castle
a
long
corridor
had
been
added
to
it
by
way
of
entrance
which
was
called
the
hall
of
the
guards
over
this
hall
which
was
like
an
entresol
was
the
library
and
above
that
a
granary
separated
by
pillars
stood
the
long
windows
with
their
small
panes
of
bohemian
glass
medallions
were
sculptured
on
the
walls
the
fortress
was
three
stories
high
halberds
and
muskets
were
to
be
found
below
books
in
the
middle
and
over
all
the
bags
of
oats
a
somewhat
barbarous
arrangement
but
princely
to
the
last
degree
the
tower
loomed
above
this
coquettish
building
presenting
a
stern
and
gloomy
contrast
the
platform
offered
a
point
of
attack
from
which
the
bridge
could
be
destroyed
between
these
two
buildings
there
was
no
harmony
whatsoever
the
roughness
of
the
one
jarred
against
the
elegance
of
the
other
it
would
seem
as
if
two
semicircles
ought
to
be
identical
yet
no
two
styles
have
less
in
common
than
that
of
a
roman
semicircle
and
a
classic
archivolt
that
tower
a
worthy
companion
for
the
forest
was
a
strange
neighbor
for
the
bridge
which
might
have
come
from
versailles
fancy
louis
xiv
leaning
on
the
arm
of
alain
there
was
something
appalling
in
this
juxtaposition
an
inexpressible
spirit
of
terror
pervaded
the
combined
majesty
of
these
structures
let
us
repeat
that
from
a
military
point
of
view
the
bridge
went
far
towards
betraying
the
tower
for
while
it
added
to
its
beauty
it
diminished
its
strength
ornamenting
it
on
the
one
hand
and
weakening
it
on
the
other
by
placing
it
on
a
level
with
the
plateau
it
had
exposed
it
to
attacks
from
that
direction
although
it
still
remained
impregnable
in
the
direction
of
the
forest
formerly
it
had
commanded
the
plateau
but
matters
were
now
reversed
an
enemy
installed
on
the
plain
would
speedily
become
master
of
the
bridge
the
library
and
the
granary
were
advantageous
to
the
besiegers
rather
than
to
the
besieged
since
the
contents
of
both
are
of
a
combustible
nature
for
an
assailant
who
knows
how
to
avail
himself
of
fire
as
a
means
of
assault
it
matters
but
little
whether
it
be
a
homer
or
a
bundle
of
hay
provided
it
burns
the
french
offered
a
proof
of
this
fact
to
the
germans
when
they
burned
the
library
at
heidelberg
as
did
the
germans
in
burning
that
of
strasbourg
in
short
this
bridge
built
on
to
the
tourgue
was
a
strategic
mistake
but
in
the
seventeenth
century
under
colbert
and
louvois
the
princes
gauvain
like
the
princes
de
rohan
or
la
tremoille
believed
themselves
henceforth
safe
from
assault
still
the
builders
of
the
bridge
had
taken
certain
precautions
in
the
first
place
anticipating
the
chances
of
fire
they
had
fastened
crosswise
below
the
three
windows
looking
towards
the
stream
by
iron
clamps
which
no
longer
than
fifty
years
ago
were
still
to
be
seen
a
strong
ladder
equal
in
length
to
the
height
of
the
first
two
stories
of
the
bridge
a
height
surpassing
that
of
three
ordinary
stories
secondly
foreseeing
the
possibility
of
a
siege
they
had
isolated
the
bridge
from
the
tower
by
means
of
a
low
and
heavy
iron
door
arched
at
the
top
and
locked
with
a
large
key
whose
was
known
to
the
master
alone
once
closed
it
could
defy
the
and
almost
brave
the
one
must
cross
the
bridge
to
reach
this
door
which
was
the
only
means
of
access
to
the
tower
the
iron
door
as
a
result
of
the
elevation
of
this
castle
on
the
bridge
by
means
of
piles
its
second
story
was
on
a
level
with
the
corresponding
story
of
the
tower
and
here
for
greater
safety
the
iron
door
had
been
placed
this
iron
door
led
from
the
bridge
into
the
library
and
from
the
tower
into
a
large
vaulted
hall
with
a
pillar
in
the
centre
as
already
stated
this
hall
was
in
the
second
story
of
the
keep
like
the
tower
itself
it
was
circular
in
its
form
and
was
lighted
by
deep
embrasures
overlooking
the
fields
the
stones
of
its
rough
and
naked
walls
unhidden
from
the
view
were
however
symmetrically
adjusted
this
hall
was
reached
by
a
spiral
staircase
built
in
the
wall
quite
a
simple
matter
when
walls
are
fifteen
feet
thick
in
the
middle
ages
they
used
to
capture
a
city
by
streets
a
street
by
houses
and
a
house
by
rooms
and
thus
a
fortress
was
besieged
story
by
story
in
this
respect
la
tourgue
was
very
skilfully
arranged
and
very
difficult
to
cope
with
an
uncomfortable
staircase
connected
one
story
with
another
the
doors
were
sloping
and
not
high
enough
to
admit
a
man
unless
he
bent
his
head
and
where
at
every
door
the
besieged
stood
in
waiting
for
their
assailants
a
bowed
head
was
certain
death
below
the
circular
hall
with
the
pillar
were
two
similar
rooms
composing
the
first
story
and
the
and
above
these
three
more
the
tower
was
closed
so
to
speak
by
a
platform
which
rested
on
these
six
rooms
like
a
stone
cover
and
a
narrow
led
up
to
the
platform
as
they
were
obliged
to
pierce
this
wall
in
which
the
iron
door
was
sealed
to
a
depth
of
fifteen
feet
it
was
thereby
framed
in
a
deep
archway
which
when
the
door
was
closed
formed
a
porch
six
or
seven
feet
deep
towards
the
bridge
as
well
as
towards
the
tower
and
when
it
was
open
these
two
porches
united
to
form
the
entrance
arch
set
in
the
wall
under
the
porch
towards
the
bridge
was
a
low
gate
with
a
bolt
leading
into
the
corridor
of
the
first
story
under
the
library
this
was
another
difficulty
for
the
besiegers
that
side
of
the
castle
on
the
bridge
looking
towards
the
plateau
ended
in
a
perpendicular
wall
and
there
the
bridge
was
severed
the
drawbridge
set
up
against
a
low
gate
to
connect
it
with
the
plateau
and
which
on
account
of
the
height
of
the
latter
could
only
be
lowered
like
an
inclined
plane
led
into
the
long
corridor
called
the
the
besiegers
who
found
themselves
in
possession
of
this
corridor
would
have
been
obliged
to
carry
by
main
force
the
winding
stairway
that
led
to
the
second
story
in
order
to
reach
the
iron
gate
vi
the
library
as
to
the
library
it
was
an
oblong
room
of
the
same
length
and
width
as
the
bridge
with
a
single
door
and
that
the
iron
one
a
false
covered
with
green
cloth
which
only
needed
to
be
pushed
concealed
within
the
entrance
arch
of
the
tower
the
walls
of
the
library
were
lined
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
glass
bookcases
in
the
fine
taste
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
lighted
by
six
large
windows
three
on
a
side
that
is
one
over
each
arch
through
these
windows
the
interior
of
the
room
was
visible
from
the
height
of
the
platform
between
the
windows
stood
six
marble

anachalus
who
for
that
matter
was
no
more
a
chancellor
than
clovis
was
a
king
there
were
various
books
in
the
library
one
has
remained
famous
it
was
an
ancient
quarto
enriched
with
prints
with
the
title
saint
bartholomew
in
large
letters
together
with
the
gospel
according
to
saint
bartholomew
preceded
by
a
dissertation
by
pantoenus
christian
philosopher
on
the
question
as
to
whether
this
gospel
should
be
considered
apocryphal
and
whether
saint
bartholomew
is
identical
with
nathanal
this
book
supposed
to
be
a
unique
copy
was
placed
on
a
in
the
middle
of
the
library
in
the
last
century
people
came
to
see
it
as
a
curiosity

this

by

at

on

first
day
of

as
a
retaliation
for
these
acts

the
cruelties

later
the

of

the

were
eager

a

were
to

and

of

here
was
a
crisis
without
parallel
war
was
suspended
in
one
direction
only
to
break
out
in
another
no
mercy
no
prisoners
was
the
of
both
parties
dark
and
terrible
shadows
fall
across
the
pages
of
history
in
these
times
in
this
very
month
of
august
the
tourgue
was
besieged
one
evening
just
as
the
stars
were
rising
in
the
calm
twilight
peculiar
to
weather
when
not
a
leaf
stirred
in
the
woods
nor
a
blade
of
grass
quivered
on
the
plain
the
sound
of
a
horn
was
heard
through
the
silence
of
the
approaching
night
it
came
from
the
summit
of
the
tower
this
peal
was
answered
by
the
ring
of
a
clarion
from
below
on
the
top
of
the
tower
stood
an
armed
man
and
in
the
shadow
below
lay
a
camp
in
the
obscurity
around
the
one
could
dimly
distinguish
the
moving
to
and
fro
of
dark
figures
this
was
the
bivouac
a
few
fires
had
been
kindled
beneath
the
and
among
the
heather
of
the
plateau
their
shining
points
of
light
pricking
through
the
darkness
here
and
there
as
if
earth
as
well
as
sky
would
deck
itself
out
with
stars
though
it
were
but
with
the
lurid
stars
of
war
towards
the
plateau
the
bivouac
stretched
as
far
as
the
plain
and
in
the
direction
of
the
forest
it
extended
into
the
thicket
the
tourgue
was
invested
the
extent
of
the
besiegers
bivouac
indicated
a
numerous
force
the
camp
pressed
hard
upon
the
fortress
reaching
to
the
rock
in
the
direction
of
the
tower
and
as
far
as
the
ravine
on
the
side
of
the
bridge
another
peal
from
the
horn
was
heard
followed
by
a
second
blast
from
the
clarion
the
horn
asked
the
question
and
the
clarion
made
reply
the
horn
was
the
voice
of
the
tower
asking
the
camp
may
we
speak
with
you
to
which
the
clarion
speaking
for
the
camp
answered
yes
at
that
time
the
convention
did
not
regard
the
vendeans
in
the
light
of
belligerents
and
it
being
forbidden
by
a
decree
to
exchange
flags
of
truce
with
the
brigands
they
supplemented
as
best
they
could
the
usual
means
of
communication
which
international
law
authorizes
in
ordinary
warfare
but
interdicts
in
civil
conflicts
consequently
in
time
of
need
a
certain
understanding
existed
between
the
peasant
horn
and
the
military
clarion
the
first
call
simply
broached
the
subject
the
second
asked
the
question
will
you
listen
if
the
clarion
made
no
reply
to
the
second
question
it
meant
refusal
if
on
the
other
hand
the
clarion
replied
it
was
consent
and
signified
a
truce
for
a
few
minutes
when
the
clarion
answered
this
second
call
the
man
who
stood
on
the
top
of
the
tower
spoke
and
these
were
his
words
be
it
known
to
all
ye
who
hear
me
i
am
surnamed
because
i
have
killed
many
of
your
people
and
also
surnamed
the
imânus
because
i
mean
to
kill
many
more
in
the
attack
at
granville
while
my
finger
rested
on
the
barrel
of
my
gun
it
was
chopped
off
by
a
at
laval
you
guillotined
my
father
my
mother
and
my
sister
jacqueline
and
now
you
know
me
i
speak
to
you
in
the
name
of
my
master
monseigneur
le
marquis
gauvain
de
lantenac
vicomte
de
fontenay
breton
prince
and
owner
of
the
seven
forests
it
is
well
for
you
to
learn
that
before
shutting
himself
up
in
this
tower
where
you
hold
him
blockaded
monsieur
le
marquis
distributed
the
command
among
six
chiefs
his
lieutenants
to
delière
he
assigned
the
country
between
the
woods
of
brest
and
erneé
to
treton
that
which
lies
between
the
roë
and
laval
to
jacquet
called
taillefer

border
of
the
to
gaulier
called
to
lecomte
craon
to
monsieur
fougères
and
to
monsieur
de
rochambeau
all
mayenne
so
that
the
capture
of
this
fortress
by
no
means
ends
the
war
for
you
and
even
were
monsieur
le
marquis
to
die
the
vendée
of
god
and
the
king
will
still
live
i
say
this
for
your
information
monseigneur
is
here
beside
me
i
am
but
his
mouthpiece
silence
besiegers
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
consider
my
words
remember
that
the
war
you
are
waging
against
us
is
unjust
we
are
men
living
in
our
own
land
and
fighting
honestly
submissive
to
the
will
of
god
we
are
as
simple
and
upright
as
the
grass
beneath
the
dew
it
is
the
republic
who
has
attacked
us
she
comes
to
trouble
us
in
our
fields
she
has
burned
our
houses
and
our
harvests
and
destroyed
our
farms
and
our
women
and
children
have
been
forced
to
run
barefoot
in
the
woods
while
the
was
still
singing
you
who
are
down
there
listening
to
me
you
have
pursued
us
through
the
forest
and
surrounded
us
in
this
tower
you
have
killed
or
scattered
our
allies
you
have
cannon
and
you
have
added
to
your
division
the
garrisons
and
the
posts
of
mortain
barenton
teilleul
landivy
evran
tinténiac
and
vitré
which
gives
you
four
thousand
five
hundred
men
with
which
to
attack
us
we
who
are
nineteen
for
the
defence
are
supplied
with
provisions
and
munitions
you
have
succeeded
in
undermining
and
blowing
up
a
part
of
our
rock
and
wall
thus
making
a
breach
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
through
which
you
can
enter
although
it
is
not
open
while
the
tower
stands
strong
and
upright
forming
an
arch
above
it
now
you
are
preparing
for
the
assault
and
we
first
of
all
monseigneur
le
marquis
who
is
a
breton
prince
and
the
secular
prior
of
the
abbey
of
de

where
a
daily
mass
was
instituted
by
queen

and
the
other
defenders
of
this
tower
who

and
myself

peasant
born
in
the
town
of
daon
through
which
runs
the
brook
moriandre
we
have
one
thing
to
tell
you
listen
now
ye
men
at
the
foot
of
this
tower
we
hold
three
prisoners
the
same
children
who
were
adopted
by
one
of
your
battalions
and
they
are
yours
we
offer
to
give
them
back
to
you
on
one
condition
that
we
be
allowed
to
go
free
if
you
refuse
listen
to
this
there
are
but
two
points
of
attack
either
the
breach
or
the
bridge
according
as
you
advance
from
the
fortress
or
the
plateau
there
are
three
stories
in
the
building
on
the
bridge
in
the
lower
one
i
the
imânus
who
speak
to
you
have
placed
six
casks
of
tar
and
one
hundred
bundles
of
dry
heather
there
is
straw
in
the
upper
and
there
are
books
and
papers
in
the
middle
story
the
iron
door
communicating
with
the
tower
is
closed
and
monseigneur
carries
the
key
on
his
person
i
have
made
a
hole
under
the
door
through
which
is
passed
a
sulphur
one
end
of
it
is
in
a
cask
of
tar
and
the
other
within
reach
of
my
hand
inside
the
tower
i
can
set
it
on
fire
whenever
i
choose
if
you
refuse
to
let
us
go
free
the
children
will
be
placed
on
the
second
floor
of
the
bridge
between
the
story
where
the
ends
in
the
barrel
and
the
one
which
is
filled
with
straw
and
the
iron
door
will
be
closed
on
them
if
you
attack
us
by
way
of
the
bridge
you
will
be
the
ones
to
set
the
building
on
fire
if
by
the
breach
it
will
be
left
to
us
and
if
you
attack
us
from
both
sides
at
once
we
shall
both
be
kindling
the
fire
at
the
same
instant
at
all
events
the
three
children
will
perish
it
rests
with
you
now
either
to
accept
or
refuse
if
you
accept
we
depart
if
you
refuse
the
children
die
i
have
finished
and
the
man
who
had
been
speaking
from
the
top
of
the
tower
was
silent
we
refuse
cried
a
voice
from
below
in
tones
abrupt
and
severe
another
voice
quite
as
firm
although
less
harsh
added
we
give
you
hours
to
surrender
at
discretion
a
silence
ensued
and
then
the
same
voice
continued
if
at
this
hour
you
have
not
surrendered
we
begin
the
assault
and
give
no
quarter
resumed
the
first
speaker
and
then
a
voice
from
the
top
of
the
tower
made
reply
to
the
savage
one
between
two
battlements
a
tall
figure
in
which
by
the
light
of
the
stars
one
might
have
recognized
the
form
of
the
marquis
de
lantenac
leaned
forward
his
glance
piercing
the
shadows
seemed
searching
for
some
one
ah
it
is
thou
priest
he
cried
yes
it
is
i
traitor
replied
the
harsh
voice
from
below
xi
terrible
as
the
antique
this
implacable
voice
was
in
truth
the
voice
of
cimourdain
the
younger
and
less
imperative
one
was
that
of
gauvain
the
marquis
de
lantenac
had
not
been
mistaken
in
his
recognition
of
the
abbé
cimourdain
in
this
district
ensanguined
by
civil
war
cimourdain
as
we
have
said
had
in
a
few
weeks
become
famous
no
man
had
won
a
more
baleful
notoriety
men
would
say
marat
in
paris
châlier
at
lyons
cimourdain
in
the
vendée
all
the
veneration
which
the
abbé
cimourdain
had
formerly
enjoyed
was
now
turned
to
his
dishonor
this
is
what
a
priest
who
unfrocks
himself
may
fairly
expect
cimourdain
excited
a
feeling
of
horror
the
austere
are
unfortunate
inasmuch
as
their
own
acts
seem
to
condemn
them
could
their
consciences
be
revealed
men
might
perhaps
absolve
them
a
lycurgus
misunderstood
may
seem
like
a
tiberius
however
the
fact
remains
that
these
two
men
the
marquis
de
lantenac
and
the
abbé
cimourdain
were
equally
matched
in
regard
to
the
hatred
they
inspired
the
maledictions
hurled
at
cimourdain
by
the
royalists
were
counterbalanced
by
the
execrations
which
the
republicans
heaped
upon
lantenac
each
of
those
men
seemed
a
monster
in
the
eyes
of
the
opposite
camp
in
fact
by
a
singular
coincidence
it
chanced
that
while
prieur
de
la
marne
at
granville
had
set
a
price
on
the
head
of
lantenac
charette
at
noirmoutier
had
likewise
set
one
on
that
of
cimourdain
we
may
observe
that
these
two
men
the
marquis
and
the
priest
represented
in
a
certain
degree
one
and
the
same
man
the
bronze
mask
of
civil
war
has
a
double
profile
one
of
which
looks
towards
the
past
the
other
towards
the
future
lantenac
wore
the
former
cimourdain
the
latter
only
the
bitter
sneer
of
lantenac
was
shrouded
in
darkness
whereas
on
cimourdain
fatal
brow
might
be
discerned
a
glimmer
of
the
dawn
meanwhile
the
besieged
tourgue
was
enjoying
a
respite
thanks
to
the
intervention
of
gauvain
they
had
agreed
upon
a
sort
of
truce
for
hours
the
imânus
had
indeed
been
well
informed
in
consequence
of
cimourdain
requisitions
gauvain
was
now
in
command
of
four
thousand
five
hundred
men
national
guards
as
well
as
troops
of
the
line
with
which
he
surrounded
lantenac
in
the
tourgue
and
could
moreover
bring
to
bear
against
the
fortress
a
masked
battery
of
six
cannon
planted
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
towards
the
tower
together
with
an
open
battery
of
six
on
the
plateau
towards
the
bridge
he
had
succeeded
in
springing
the
mine
and
a
breach
had
been
made
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
thus
on
the
expiration
of
the
hours
truce
the
struggle
would
begin
again
under
the
following
conditions
on
the
plateau
and
in
the
forest
were
four
thousand
five
hundred
men
against
nineteen
in
the
tower
history
may
find
the
names
of
the
nineteen
besieged
in
the
placards
posted
against
outlaws
we
may
possibly
come
across
them
it
would
have
pleased
cimourdain
had
gauvain
consented
to
accept
the
rank
of
in
order
to
command
these
four
thousand
five
hundred
men
which
was
practically
an
army
but
the
latter
refused
saying
we
will
consider
that
matter
after
lantenac
is
taken
i
have
won
no
promotion
as
yet
these
important
commands
held
by
officers
of
subordinate
rank
were
moreover
in
accordance
with
republican
customs
bonaparte
later
on
while
as
yet
only
a
colonel
of
artillery
was
at
the
same
time
of
the
army
of
italy
it
was
a
strange
fate
for
the
to
be
attacked
by
one
gauvain
while
defended
by
another
member
of
the
same
family
hence
a
certain
reluctance
in
the
attack
but
none
in
the
defence
for
de
lantenac
was
a
man
who
spared
nothing
accustomed
as
he
had
been
to
live
at
versailles
he
had
no
feeling
of
regard
for
the
tourgue
which
he
scarcely
knew
he
had
sought
refuge
there
simply
because
he
had
no
other
resource
but
he
would
have
destroyed
it
without
a
scruple
gauvain
felt
more
respect
for
it
the
bridge
was
the
weak
point
of
the
fortress
but
in
the
library
above
it
were
the
family
records
now
if
the
assault
began
there
the
burning
of
the
bridge
would
be
inevitable
and
it
seemed
to
gauvain
that
to
burn
the
records
would
be
like
attacking
his
ancestors
the
tourgue
was
the
ancestral
manor
of
the
gauvain
family
from
this
tower
started
all
their
fiefs
of
brittany
as
those
of
france
from
the
tower
of
the
louvre
it
was
the
centre
round
which
clustered
the
family
associations
of
the
gauvains
he
himself
was
born
there
and
now
led
by
the
tortuous
chances
of
fate
the
grown
man
had
come
to
attack
the
venerable
walls
that
had
protected
his
childhood
illustration
was
it
an
impious
act
to
lay
this
dwelling
in
ashes
perhaps
his
own
cradle
was
stored
away
in
some
corner
of
the
granary
over
the
library
certain
trains
of
thought
assume
the
nature
of
emotions
before
the
old
family
mansion
gauvain
felt
himself
deeply
moved
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
feeling
that
he
had
spared
the
bridge
contenting
himself
with
making
it
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
sally
forth
or
attempt
an
escape
at
this
point
of
egress
he
held
the
bridge
in
check
by
a
battery
and
chose
the
opposite
side
for
the
attack
hence
the
mining
and
sapping
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
cimourdain
had
allowed
him
to
take
his
own
course
meanwhile
reproaching
himself
for
these
gothic
antiquities
were
odious
to
his
severe
soul
and
he
was
no
more
indulgent
towards
buildings
than
towards
human
beings
sparing
a
castle
was
the
first
step
in
the
direction
of
mercy
and
he
knew
that
mercy
was
gauvain
weak
point
cimourdain
as
we
are
aware
kept
watch
over
him
and
arrested
his
progress
down
this
slope
so
fatal
in
his
eyes
and
yet
even
he
and
he
acknowledged
it
to
himself
with
a
sort
of
indignation
had
been
unable
to
see
the
tourgue
again
without
a
secret
emotion
he
was
affected
by
the
sight
of
that
schoolroom
containing
the
first
books
in
which
he
had
taught
gauvain
to
read
he
had
been
the
curé
of
the
neighboring
village
parigné
had
occupied
an
upper
room
in
the
castle
on
the
bridge
it
was
in
the
library
that
he
held
little
gauvain
between
his
knees
and
taught
him
the
alphabet
within
these
four
old
walls
he
had
seen
his
beloved
pupil
the
child
of
his
soul
growing
up
to
manhood
and
watched
the
development
of
his
mind
was
he
about
to
burn
and
destroy
this
library
this
castle
these
walls
wherein
he
had
so
often
blessed
the
child
he
had
spared
them
but
it
had
not
been
done
without
compunction
he
had
allowed
gauvain
to
begin
the
siege
from
the
opposite
point
the
tower
might
have
been
called
the
savage
side
of
the
tourgue
and
the
library
its
civilized
side
cimourdain
had
allowed
gauvain
to
make
the
breach
only
in
the
former
this
ancient
castle
in
the
midst
of
the
revolution
had
after
all
only
resumed
its
feudal
customs
in
being
at
the
same
time
attacked
and
defended
by
a
gauvain
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
is
but
a
record
of
wars
between
kinsmen
étéocles
and
polynices
are
gothic
as
well
as
grecian
and
hamlet
but
repeats
in
elsinore
what
orestes
did
in
argos
xii
the
rescue
planned
the
entire
night
was
spent
by
both
parties
in
preparations
as
soon
as
the
gloomy
parley
to
which
we
lately
listened
was
over
gauvain
first
act
was
to
summon
his
lieutenant
guéchamp
with
whom
we
must
become
acquainted
was
a
man
of
the
secondary
order
honest
brave
commonplace
a
better
soldier
than
commander
strictly
intelligent
up
to
the
point
when
it
becomes
a
duty
not
to
understand
never
moved
to
tenderness
proof
against
corruption
in
whatsoever
shape
it
might
present
itself
whether
in
the
form
of
bribery
that
taints
the
conscience
or
in
that
of
pity
that
corrupts
justice
as
the
eyes
of
a
horse
are
shaded
by
his
blinders
so
were
his
heart
and
soul
protected
by
the
two
screens
of
discipline
and
the
order
of
command
and
he
walked
straight
ahead
in
the
space
they
allowed
him
to
see
his
course
was
direct
but
his
path
was
narrow
a
man
to
be
depended
on
withal
stern
in
command
exact
in
obedience
gauvain
spoke
in
rapid
tones
we
need
a
ladder
guéchamp
we
have
none
commander
one
must
be
found
for
scaling
no
for
rescue
after
a
moments
reflection
guéchamp
replied
i
understand
but
to
serve
your
purpose
a
very
long
one
is
needed
the
length
of
three
stories
yes
commander
that
about
the
height
it
ought
to
be
longer
than
that
for
we
must
be
sure
of
success
certainly
how
is
it
that
you
have
no
ladder
illustration
commander
you
did
not
think
it
best
to
besiege
the
tourgue
from
the
plateau
you
were
satisfied
to
blockade
it
on
that
side
you
planned
the
attack
by
way
of
the
tower
and
not
from
the
bridge
so
we
gave
our
attention
to
the
mine
and
thought
no
more
about
the
scaling
that
is
why
we
have
no
ladder
have
one
made
at
once
a
ladder
of
the
length
of
three
stories
can
not
be
made
at
once
then
fasten
several
short
ones
together
but
we
must
first
get
our
ladders
find
them
there
are
none
to
be
found
all
through
the
country
the
peasants
destroy
ladders
just
as
they
break
up
the
carts
and
cut
the
bridges
true
they
intend
to
paralyze
the
republic
they
mean
that
we
shall
neither
transport
baggage
cross
a
river
nor
scale
a
wall
but
i
must
have
a
ladder
in
spite
of
all
that
i
was
thinking
commander
that
at
javené
near
fougères
there
is
a
large
carpenter
shop
we
might
get
one
there
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
when
do
you
want
the
ladder
by
this
time
at
the
latest
i
will
send
a
messenger
at
full
speed
to
javené
to
carry
the
order
for
a
requisition
a
post
of
cavalry
stationed
there
will
furnish
an
escort
the
ladder
may
be
here
before
sunset
very
well
that
will
answer
said
gauvain
only
be
quick
about
it
go
ten
minutes
later
guéchamp
returned
and
said
to
gauvain
the
messenger
has
started
for
javené
gauvain
ascended
the
plateau
and
for
a
long
time
stood
gazing
intently
on
the
across
the
ravine
the
gable
of
the
castle
with
no
other
opening
than
the
low
entrance
closed
by
the
raised
drawbridge
faced
the
escarpment
of
the
ravine
in
order
to
reach
the
plateau
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
one
roust
climb
down
the
face
of
the
ravine
which
might
be
accomplished
by
clinging
to
the
bushes
but
once
in
the
moat
the
assailants
would
be
exposed
to
a
shower
of
missiles
from
the
three
stories
gauvain
became
convinced
that
at
this
stage
of
the
siege
the
proper
way
to
attack
was
through
the
breach
of
the
tower
he
took
every
precaution
to
render
flight
impossible
he
perfected
the
strict
blockade
of
the
tourgue
drawing
the
meshes
of
his
battalions
more
and
more
closely
so
that
nothing
could
pass
between
them
gauvain
and
cimourdain
divided
the
investment
of
the
fortress
between
them
the
former
reserving
for
himself
the
forest
side
and
leaving
the
plateau
to
cimourdain
it
was
agreed
that
while
gauvain
aided
by
guéchamp
should
conduct
the
assault
through
the
mine
cimourdain
with
all
the
matches
of
the
upper
battery
lighted
should
watch
the
bridge
and
the
ravine
xiii
what
the
marquis
is
doing
while
all
these
preparations
for
the
attack
were
going
on
outside
they
were
also
making
ready
for
resistance
inside
the
tower
a
tower
may
be
entered
by
a
mine
as
a
cask
is
bored
by
an
auger
hence
a
tower
is
sometimes
called
a
and
it
was
the
fate
of
the
tourgue
to
have
its
walls
pierced
by
a
the
powerful
boring
of
two
or
three
of
powder
had
driven
a
hole
through
the
mighty
wall
from
one
side
to
the
other
beginning
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
it
had
made
a
breach
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
wall
in
a
sort
of
shapeless
arch
in
the
lower
story
of
the
fortress
and
in
order
to
make
this
hole
more
practicable
for
assault
from
without
the
besiegers
had
enlarged
it
by
the
where
this
breach
had
penetrated
was
a
large
empty
hall
of
a
circular
form
with
a
pillar
in
the
centre
supporting
the
keystone
of
the
vaulted
ceiling
the
hall
which
was
the
largest
in
the
keep
was
no
less
than
forty
feet
in
diameter
each
story
of
the
tower
had
a
similar
room
only
on
a
smaller
scale
with
guards
to
the
embrasures
of
the
the
hall
on
the
had
neither
embrasures
ventilators
nor
dormer
windows
there
was
about
as
much
air
and
light
in
it
as
in
a
tomb
the
door
of
the
oubliettes
the
greater
part
of
which
was
iron
was
in
the
lower
hall
another
door
opened
on
a
staircase
leading
to
the
upper
rooms
all
the
staircases
were
built
in
the
wall
itself
it
was
to
the
lower
hall
that
the
besieged
had
gained
access
by
the
breach
they
had
made
but
even
after
gaining
possession
of
it
the
tower
would
still
remain
to
be
taken
one
could
scarcely
breathe
in
this
lower
hall
and
formerly
no
one
could
remain
in
it
hours
without
suffocating
but
now
thanks
to
the
breach
one
could
exist
there
for
this
reason
the
besieged
had
not
closed
the
breach
besides
what
purpose
would
it
have
served
the
guns
would
have
reopened
it
they
had
fastened
an
iron
into
the
wall
wherein
they
set
a
torch
and
that
lighted
the
lower
floor
but
how
were
they
to
defend
themselves
to
stop
up
the
hole
would
have
been
easy
enough
but
useless
a
would
be
more
effective
a

an
intrenchment
with
a
retreating
angle
a
kind
of
barricade
composed
of
rafters
by
means
of
which
the
fire
may
be
concentrated
on
the
assailants
and
which
while
leaving
the
breach
open
from
without
closes
it
from
within
there
was
no
lack
of
materials
and
they
proceeded
to
construct

barricade

places

a
terrible
spirit
lantenac
was
one
of
those
soldiers
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
save
cities
at
the
age
of
eighty
he
resembled
the
count
who
when
almost
a
centenarian
drove
the
king
of
poland
from
riga
courage
friends
he
said
in

the
beginning
of

century

with
three
hundred
swedes
held

thousand

they
barricaded
the
two
lower
stories
fortified
the
chambers
converted
the
alcoves
into
battlements
supported
the
doors
with
beams
driven
in
by
a
mallet
thus
forming
buttresses
but
the
spiral
staircase
connecting
the
different
stories
they
were
obliged
to
leave
free
since
if
they
blockaded
it
against
the
besieger
their
own
passage
would
be
obstructed
thus
a
fortification
always
has
its
weak
point
the

as

putting
his

by

so
that

could
neither

way
the

windows
which
were
high
had
no

the
imânus
was
accompanied
by
three
men
as
resolute
and
daring
as
himself
these
men
were
hoisnard
called
and
the
two
brothers
taking

him

opened
the

as
implacable
as

the

filled
with
hay
and
straw
as
well
as
the
lower
one
into
which
he
had
several

which
he
placed
near
the

ordered
bundles
of
dry
heather
to
be
so
arranged
that
they
would
touch
the
after
which
he
made
sure
that
the
one
end
of
which
was
on
the
bridge
and
the
other
in
the
tower
was
in
good
working
order
over
the
floor
under
the
casks
and
the
bundles
he
poured
a
pool
of
tar
into
which
he
dipped
the
end
of
the
then
he
ordered
his
men
to
bring
into
the
library
between
the
and
the
attic
with
tar
beneath
and
straw
overhead
three
cradles
containing
and
georgette
who
were
all
sound
asleep
the
cradles
were
brought
in
very
gently
that
the
children
might
not
be
roused
they
were
simple
little
village
cribs
something
like
an
osier
basket
which
when
placed
on
the
floor
were
low
enough
for
a
child
to
climb
in
and
out
without
help
beside
each
cradle
the
imânus
ordered
them
to
place
a
porringer
of
soup
together
with
a
wooden
spoon
the
taken
off
its
hooks
was
laid
on
the
floor
against
the
wall
and
the
three
cradles
were
placed
end
to
end
along
the
opposite
wall
facing
the
ladder
then
thinking
that
a
current
of
air
might
be
useful
he
flung
wide
open
the
six
windows
of
the
library
it
was
a
warm
and
clear
summer
night
he
sent
the
brothers
to
open
the
windows
in
the
stories
above
and
below
on
the
eastern
façade
of
the
building
he
had
observed
a
large
ivy
old
and
withered
about
the
color
of
tinder
which
entirely
covered
one
side
of
the
bridge
framing
the
windows
of
the
three
stories
and
thought
that
this
ivy
would
do
no
harm
after
bestowing
a
last
glance
on
everything
the
imânus
and
his
men
left
the
châtelet
and
returned
into
the
keep
double
locking
the
heavy
iron
door
he
examined
attentively
this
immense
and
lock
nodded
approvingly
at
the
passed
through
the
hole
he
had
drilled
which
was
henceforth
the
only
channel
of
communication
between
the
tower
and
the
bridge
this
match
starting
from
the
round
room
passed
beneath
the
iron
door
and
entered
under
the
arch
coiled
over
the
spiral
stairs
crept
across
the
floor
of
the
corridor
below
and
ended
in
the
pool
of
tar
under
the
dry
heath
the
imânus
had
calculated
that
it
would
take
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
the
time
this
was
lighted
from
the
interior
of
the
tower
to
set
on
fire
the
pool
of
tar
under
the
library
having
completed
and
reviewed
all
these
preparations
he
carried
the
key
of
the
iron
door
to
the
marquis
de
lantenac
who
put
it
in
his
pocket
every
movement
of
the
besiegers
must
be

with
his

horn
in
his

he
stood
sentinel
in
the
of
the
platform
on
the
summit
of
the
tower

keeping
his
eye
on

the
forest

a

he
tore
up

the

rose
it
revealed
in
the
forest
eight
battalions
with
sabres
at
their
sides
on
their
backs
and
fixed
bayonets
ready
for

he
lay
there
on

fast
asleep
with
his
two

in

thrust
his

outside
his

were
in

the
clothes
given

by
the

in
tatters
they
had
not
even
a

between

the
two
boys
were
almost
naked
and
georgette
was
bundled
up
in
a
rag
which
had
formerly
been
a
petticoat
but
which
now
served
the
purpose
of
a
jacket
who
had
taken
care
of
these
little
ones
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
certainly
not

those
savage
peasants
who
had
carried
them
along

they
fought
their
way
from

gave
them
their

of

and
nothing

the
little

lived
as
best
they
could
they
had
masters
in
plenty
but
no

childhood
is
enveloped
by
an
atmosphere
of
enchantment
that
lends
a
charm
to
its
very
rags
and
these
three
tiny
beings
were
delightful
georgette
chattered
away
the
child
prattles
as
the
bird
sings
but
it
is
always
the
same
hymn
indistinct
inarticulate
and
yet
full
of
deep
meaning
only
the
child
unlike
the
bird
has
the
dark
fate
of
humanity
before
it
none
can
listen
to
the
joyous
song
of
a
child
without
a
sense
of
sadness
the
lisping
of
a
human
soul
from
the
lips
of
childhood
may
well
be
called
the
most
sublime
of
earthly
songs
this
confused
murmuring
of
thought
which
is
as
yet
mere
instinct
contains
an
unconscious
appeal
to
eternal
justice
perhaps
it
is
a
protest
uttered
on
the
threshold
of
life
an
unconscious
protest
distressing
to
hear
ignorance
smiling
on
the
infinite
seems
to
make
all
creation
responsible
for
the
fate
allotted
to
a
weak
and
defenceless
being
should
misfortune
befall
it
would
seem
like
an
abuse
of
confidence
the
prattle
of
a
child
is
more
and
less
than
speech
it
is
a
song
without
notes
a
language
without
syllables
a
murmur
that
begins
in
heaven
but
is
not
to
end
on
earth
as
it
began
before
birth
so
it
will
go
on
after
death
as
the
lispings
are
the
continuance
of
what
the
child
said
when
he
was
an
angel
they
are
likewise
a
foreshadowing
of
what
he
will
say
in
eternity
the
cradle
has
its
yesterday
as
the
grave
has
its
morrow
and
the
double
mystery
of
both
mingles
with
this
unintelligible
babble
there
is
no
such
proof
of
god
of
eternity
of
responsibility
and
of
the
duality
of
destiny
as
is
this
shadow
which
we
see
resting
upon
a
bright
young
soul
still
there
was
nothing
melancholy
about
georgette
chatter
for
her
sweet
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
her
mouth
her
eyes
the
dimples
in
her
cheeks
all
smiled
in
concert
and
by
this
smile
she
seemed
to
show
her
delight
in
the
morning
the
human
soul
believes
in
sunshine
the
sky
was
blue
the
weather
warm
and
beautiful
and
this
frail
creature
neither
knowing
nor
comprehending
the
meaning
of
life
living
in
a
dream
as
it
were
felt
safe
amid
the
loveliness
of
nature
with
its
friendly
trees
and
its
pure
verdure
the
serene

noises

above
all
the
intense
purity

sunshine
the
oldest
of
the
children
a
boy
over
four
years
old
was
the
next
one
to
wake
he
stood
up
jumped
out
of
his
cradle
like
a
little
man
discovered
his
porringer
as
the
most
natural
thing
that
could
happen
seated
himself
on
the
floor
and
began
to
eat
his
soup
georgette
prattle
had
not
roused
but
at
the
sound
of
the
spoon
in
the
porringer
he
started
and
opened
his
eyes
was
the
boy
he
too
saw
his
bowl
and
as
it
was
within
reach
of
his
arm
he
seized
it
and
without
getting
out
of
bed
with
his
dish
on
his
knees
and
his
spoon
in
his
fist
he
straightway
followed
the
example
of
georgette
did
not
hear
them
the
modulations
of
her
voice
seemed
to
keep
time
with
the
cradling
of
a
dream
her
large
eyes
gazing
upward
were
divine
however
gloomy
may
be
the
vault
over
a
child
head
heaven
is
always
reflected
in
its
eyes
when
had
finished
he
scraped
the
bottom
of
the
porringer
with
the
spoon
sighed
and
remarked
with
dignity
i
have
eaten
my
soup
this
roused
georgette
from
her
dreaming
thoup
said
she
and
seeing
that
had
finished
his
and
that
was
still
eating
she
took
the
bowl
of
soup
which
stood
beside
her
and
began
to
eat
carding
the
spoon
quite
as
often
to
her
ear
as
she
did
to
her
mouth
from
time
to
time
she
renounced
civilization
and
ate
with
her
fingers
when
had
scraped
the
bottom
of
his
porringer
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
trotted
after
his
brother
ii
suddenly
from
below
rang
the
blast
of
a
clarion
stern
and
loud
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
forest
to
which
a
trumpet
from
the
summit
of
the
tower
made
reply
this
time
the
clarion
called
and
the
trumpet
answered
and
again
came
the
summons
from
the
clarion
followed
by
the
reply
of
the
trumpet
then
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
rose
a
voice
distant
but
clear
shouting
distinctly
brigands
a
summons
if
by
sunset
you
have
not
surrendered
at
discretion
we
shall
begin
the
assault
a
voice
that
sounded
like
the
roar
of
a
wild
beast
answered
from
the
top
of
the
tower
attack
the
voice
from
below
replied
a
cannon
will
be
fired
as
a
last
warning
half
an
hour
before
the
assault
and
the
voice
from
above
repeated
attack
the
children
did
not
hear
these
voices
but
the
clarion
and
the
horn
echoed
louder
and
more
distinctly
and
at
the
first
sound
georgette
craned
her
neck
and
ceased
eating
she
had
dropped
her
spoon
into
the
porringer
and
at
the
second
blast
from
the
clarion
she
lifted
the
tiny
forefinger
of
her
right
hand
and
alternately
raising
and
letting
it
fall
she
marked
the
time
of
the
trumpet
that
was
prolonged
by
the
second
call
of
the
horn
when
the
horn
and
the
clarion
were
silent
with
her
finger
still
uplifted
she
paused
dreamily
and
then
murmured
to
herself
muthic
she
probably
meant
music
the
two
older
ones
and
had
paid
no
attention
to
the
horn
and
the
clarion
they
were
absorbed
by
another
object
who
had
spied
a
woodlouse
in
the
act
of
crawling
across
the
library
floor
exclaimed
a
creature
ran
up
to
him
it
pricks
continued
do
hurt
it
said
and
both
the
children
set
themselves
to
watch
the
traveller
meanwhile
georgette
having
finished
her
soup
was
looking
about
for
her
brothers
who
crouching
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
hung
gravely
over
the
woodlouse
their
heads
so
close
together
that
their
hair
intermingled
holding
their
breath
they
gazed
in
astonishment
at
the
creature
which
far
from
appreciating
so
much
admiration
had
stopped
crawling
and
no
longer
attempted
to
move
georgette
seeing
that
her
brothers
were
watching
something
desired
to
know
what
it
might
be
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
reach
them
but
she
undertook
it
nevertheless
the
journey
fairly
bristled
with
difficulties
all
sorts
of
things
were
scattered
over
the
floor
stools
turned
upside
down
bundles
of
papers
which
had
been
opened
and
left
empty
trunks
all
sorts
of
rubbish
around
which
she
had
to
make
her
way
a
very
archipelago
of
reefs
but
georgette
took
the
risk
her
first
achievement
was
to
crawl
out
of
the
crib
then
she
plunged
among
the
reefs
winding
her
way
through
the
straits
and
pushing
aside
a
footstool
she
crawled
between
two
boxes
and
over
a
bundle
of
papers
climbing
up
on
one
side
rolling
down
on
the
other
innocently
exposing
her
poor
little
naked
body
and
finally
reached
what
a
sailor
would
call
the
open
sea
that
is
to
say
quite
an
expanse
of
floor
unencumbered
by
rubbish
and
free
from
perils
here
she
made
a
rush
and
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
she
crept
across
the
room
on
all
fours
as
far
as
the
window
where
she
encountered
a
formidable
obstacle
in
the
shape
of
the
long
ladder
which
lying
against
the
wall
ended
at
this
window
reaching
a
little
beyond
the
corner
of
the
embrasure
thus
forming
a
sort
of
promontory
between
georgette
and
her
brothers
she
paused
and
seemed
to
consider
the
subject
and
when
she
had
solved
the
problem
to
her
satisfaction
she
resolutely
clasped
her
rosy
fingers
about
one
of
the
rungs
which
as
the
ladder
rested
on
its
side
were
not
horizontal
but
vertical
and
tried
to
pull
herself
up
on
to
her
feet
and
when
after
two
unsuccessful
attempts
she
at
last
succeeded
she
walked
the
entire
length
of
the
ladder
catching
one
rung
after
the
other
on
reaching
the
end
her
support
failed
she
stumbled
and
fell
but
nothing
daunted
she
caught
at
the
end
of
one
of
its
enormous
poles
with
her
tiny
hands
pulled
herself
up

said
georgette
and
all
three
watched
the
swallows
then
a
bee
flew
in
nothing
reminds
one
of
the
human
soul
more
than
the
bee
which
goes
from
flower
to
flower
as
a
soul
from
star
to
star
gathering
honey
as
the
soul
absorbs
the
light
this
one
came
buzzing
in
with
an
air
of
great
stir
as
if
it
said
here
i
am
i
have
just
seen
the
roses
and
now
i
have
come
to
see
the
children
what
is
going
on
here
i
should
like
to
know
a
bee
is
a
housekeeper
scolding
as
it
hums
as
long
as
the
bee
stayed
the
children
never
once
moved
their
eyes
from
it
it
explored
the
entire
library
rummaging
in
every
corner
flying
about
quite
as
if
it
were
at
home
in
its
hive
winged
and
melodious
it
darted
from
case
to
case
peering
through
the
glass
at
the
titles
of
the
books
just
as
if
it
had
a
brain
and
having
paid
its
visit
it
flew
away
it
has
gone
home
said
it
is
an
animal
remarked
no
replied
it
is
a
fly
a
said
georgette
then
who
had
just
found
a
string
on
the
floor
with
a
knot
in
the
end
took
the
other
end
between
his
thumb
and
his
forefinger
and
having
made
a
sort
of
windmill
of
the
string
he
was
deeply
absorbed
in
watching
its
whirling
georgette
on
her
part
having
returned
to
her
former
character
of
quadruped
and
started
again
on
her
capricious
journeys
across
the
floor
had
discovered
a
venerable
with
upholstery
from
which
the
was
falling
out
in
several
places
she
had
stopped
before
this
and
was
carefully
enlarging
the
holes
and
pulling
out
the
suddenly
she
raised
her
finger
to
attract
her
brothers
attention
and
make
them
listen
they
turned
their
heads
a
vague
sound
could
be
heard
outside
probably
the
attacking
camp
executing
some
strategic
manoeuvre
in
the
forest
there
was
a
neighing
of
horses
a
beating
of
drums
a
rolling
to
and
fro
of
caissons
a
clanking
of
chains
and
military
calls
and
responses
echoed
on
every
side
a
confusion
of
wild
sounds
whose
combination
resulted
in
a
sort
of
harmony
the
children
listened
in
delight
it
is
the
good
god
who
does
that
said
iv
the
noise
ceased
had
fallen
into
a
dream
how
are
ideas
formed
and
scattered
in
those
little
minds
what
is
the
mysterious
action
of
those
memories
so
faint
and
evanescent
in
this
dreamy
little
head
there
was
a
confused
vision
of
the
good
god
of
prayer
of
clasped
hands
of
a
certain
tender
smile
that
had
once
rested
on
him
and
which
now
he
missed
and
whispered
mamma
mamma
said
mma
repeated
georgette
thereupon
began
to
jump
and
lost
no
time
in
following
his
example
imitating
all
the
movements
and
gestures
of
his
brother
not
so
georgette
three
years
may
copy
four
but
twenty
months
preserves
its
independence
georgette
remained
seated
uttering
a
word
now
and
then
she
had
as
yet
achieved
no
success
in
sentences
she
was
a
thinker
and
only
uttered
monosyllabic
apothegms
after
a
few
moments
however
she
succumbed
to
the
influence
of
example
and
began
her
attempts
to
imitate
her
brothers
and
these
three
pairs
of
naked
little
feet
began
to
dance
run
and
totter
about
in
the
dust
that
covered
the
old
oaken
floor
under
the
serious
eyes
of
the
marble
busts
towards
which
georgette
from
to
time
threw
an
uneasy
glance
whispering
the
momommes
in
the
language
of
georgette
a
momomme
was
anything
that
looked
like
a
man
without
really
being
one
living
beings
are
strangely
confused
with
ghosts
in
the
minds
of
children
as
georgette
tottered
along
after
her
brothers
she
was
always
on
the
verge
of
descending
to
all
fours
suddenly
who
had
gone
near
the
window
raised
his
head
but
dropped
it
the
next
moment
and
ran
to
hide
in
a
corner
formed
by
the
embrasure
of
the
window
he
had
caught
sight
of
some
one
looking
at
him
it
was
one
of
the
blues
a
soldier
from
the
encampment
on
the
plateau
who
taking
advantage
of
the
armistice
and
perhaps
somewhat
infringing
thereon
had
ventured
to
the
edge
of
the
escarpment
from
whence
he
had
gained
a
view
of
the
interior
of
the
library
seeing
hide
hid
also
he
cuddled
down
close
by
his
brother
side
and
georgette
hid
herself
behind
them
and
there
they
stayed
silent
and
motionless
georgette
laying
her
finger
on
her
lips
after
a
few
moments
ventured
to
put
out
his
head
but
finding
the
soldier
still
there
he
quickly
drew
it
back
and
the
three
children
hardly
dared
to
breathe
this
lasted
for
quite
a
long
time
but
finally
georgette
grew
tired
of
it
she
plucked
up
the
courage
to
look
out
and
behold
the
soldier
had
gone
and
once
more
they
began
to
run
and
play
illustration
although
an
imitator
and
admirer
of
possessed
a
talent
peculiarly
his
own
that
of
making
discoveries
and
his
brother
and
sister
now
beheld
him
prancing
in
wild
delight
dragging
along
a
little
cart
which
he
had
unexpectedly
discovered
this
had
been
lying
there
for
years
forgotten
in
the
dust
side
by
side
with
works
of
genius
and
the
busts
of
sages
perhaps
gauvain
may
have
played
with
it
when
he
was
a
child
had
converted
his
bit
of
string
into
a
whip
which
he
cracked
with
great
exultation
thus
it
is
with
discoverers
if
one
can
not
discover
america
one
can
at
least
find
a
small
cart
it
amounts
to
much
the
same
thing
but
he
must
share
his
treasure
was
eager
to
harness
himself
to
the
wagon
and
georgette
tried
to
get
in
and
sit
down
was
the
horse
the
coachman
but
the
coachman
did
not
know
his
business
and
the
horse
felt
obliged
to
give
him
a
few
lessons
say
up
cried
up
repeated
the
carriage
upset
and
georgette
fell
out
whereupon
she
proceeded
to
make
it
known
that
angels
can
shriek
and
after
that
she
had
half
a
mind
to
cry
you
are
too
big
missy
said
i
big
stammered
georgette
and
her
vanity
seemed
to
console
her
for
her
fall
the
cornice
under
the
windows
was
very
wide
and
the
dust
of
the
fields
from
the
plateau
had
collected
there
after
the
rains
had
changed
this
dust
into
soil
among
the
seeds
wafted
thither
by
the
wind
was
a
bramble
which
making
the
most
of
this
shallow
soil
had
taken
root
therein
it
was
of
the
hardy
variety
known
as
the
and
now
in
august
it
was
covered
with
berries
and
one
of
its
branches
pushing
its
way
through
the
window
hung
down
almost
to
the
floor
to
the
discovery
of
the
string
and
the
cart
added
that
of
the
he
went
up
to
it
picked
off
a
berry
and
ate
it
i
am
hungry
said
and
georgette
galloping
on
her
hands
and
knees
lost
no
time
in
making
her
appearance
on
the
scene
the
three
together
soon
stripped
the
branch
and
devoured
all
the
fruit
staining
their
faces
and
hands
with
the
purple
juices
and
laughing
aloud
in
their
glee
these
three
little
seraphs
were
speedily
turned
into
three
little
fauns
who
would
have
horrified
dante
and
charmed
virgil
occasionally
the
thorns
pricked
their
fingers
every
pleasure
has
its
price
pointing
to
the
bush
and
holding
out
her
finger
on
which
stood
a
tiny
drop
of
blood
georgette
said
to
prick
who
had
also
pricked
himself
looked
suspiciously
at
the
bush
and
cried
out
it
is
a
beast
no
it
a
stick
replied
sticks
are
wicked
then
remarked
again
georgette
would
have
liked
to
cry
but
she
decided
to
laugh
illustration
meanwhile
jealous
perhaps
of
the
discoveries
of
his
younger
brother
had
conceived
a
grand
project
for
some
time
past
while
he
had
been
gathering
the
berries
and
pricking
his
fingers
his
eyes
had
turned
frequently
towards
the
which
raised
on
a
pivot
stood
alone
like
a
monument
in
the
middle
of
the
library
on
this
desk
was
displayed
the
famous
volume
of
saint
bartholomew
it
was
really
a
magnificent
and
remarkable
quarto
it
had
been
published
at
cologne
by
bloeuw
or
coesius
as
he
was
called
in
latin
the
famous
publisher
of
the
bible
of
it
was
printed
not
on
dutch
paper
but
on
that
fine
arabian
paper
so
much
admired
by
édrisi
manufactured
from
silk
and
cotton
which
always
retains
its
whiteness
the
binding
was
of
gilded
leather
and
the
clasps
of
silver
the
were
of
that
parchment
which
the
parisian
swore
to
buy
at
the
hall
and
nowhere
else
this
volume
was
full
of
engravings
on
copper
and
geographical
maps
of
many
countries
it
contained
a
preface
consisting
of
a
protest
from
the
printers
and
against
the
edict
of
which
imposed
a
tax
on
leather
beer
animals
and
paper
and
on
the
back
of
the
frontispiece
was
a
dedication
to
the
gryphs
who
rank
in
lyons
with
the
elzévirs
in
amsterdam
and
all
this
had
combined
to
produce
a
famous
copy
almost
as
rare
as
the
apostol
of
moscow
it
was
a
beautiful
book
and
for
that
reason
gazed
at
it
too
long
perhaps
the
volume
lay
open
just
at
the
large
engraving
which
represented
saint
bartholomew
carrying
his
skin
on
his
arm
this
print
could
be
seen
from
below
and
when
the
berries
were
eaten
gazed
steadily
at
it
with
all
his
longing
and
greedy
eyes
and
georgette
whose
eyes
had
taken
the
same
direction
spied
the
engraving
and
exclaimed
picsure
this
word
seemed
to
decide
then
to
the
unbounded
surprise
of
a
most
remarkable
proceeding
took
place
in
one
corner
of
the
library
stood
a
large
oaken
chair
went
up
to
this
chair
seized
it
and
dragged
it
across
the
room
all
alone
by
himself
to
the
desk
then
pushing
it
close
up
to
the
latter
he
climbed
upon
it
and
put
both
his
fists
on
the
book
having
reached
the
height
of
his
ambition
he
felt
that
it
behooved
him
to
be
generous
so
taking
the
picsure
by
the
upper
corner
he
carefully
tore
it
in
two
the
tear
crossing
the
saint
diagonally
which
was
a
pity
but
that
was
no
fault
of
the
entire
left
side
one
eye
and
a
fragment
of
the
halo
of
this
old
apocryphal
evangelist
were
left
in
the
book
he
offered
georgette
the
other
half
of
the
saint
and
the
whole
of
his
skin
georgette
as
she
received
it
remarked
momomme
me
too
cried
the
tearing
out
of
the
first
page
is
like
the
first
shedding
of
blood
in
battle
it
decides
the
carnage
turned
over
the
page
next
to
the
saint
came
the
commentator
pantoenus
he
bestowed
pantoenus
upon
meanwhile
georgette
had
torn
her
large
piece
into
two
smaller
ones
and
then
the
two
into
four
thus
it
might
have
been
recorded
in
history
that
after
being
flayed
in
armenia
was
quartered
in
brittany
vi
the
execution
finished
georgette
held
out
her
hand
to
for
more
after
the
saint
and
his
commentator
came
the
frowning
portraits
of
the
glossarists
first
came
gavantus
tore
him
out
and
placed
him
in
georgettes
hand
a
similar
fate
befell
all
the
commentators
of
the
act
of
giving
imparts
a
sense
of
superiority
kept
nothing
for
himself
he
knew
that
and
georgette
were
watching
him
and
that
was
enough
for
him
he
was
satisfied
with
the
admiration
of
his
audience
inexhaustible
in
his
magnificent
generosity
offered
fabricius
and
pignatelli
to
and
father
stilting
to
georgette
alphonse
tostat
to
a
to
georgette
had
henry
hammond
and
georgette
father
roberti
together
with
an
old
view
of
the
city
of
douai
where
the
latter
was
born
in
received
the
protest
of
the
while
georgette
obtained
the
dedication
to
the
gryphs
and
then
came
the
maps
which
also
distributed
he
gave
ethiopia
to
and
lycaonia
to
georgette
after
which
he
threw
the
book
on
the
floor
this
was
an
awful
moment
with
mingled
feelings
of
ecstasy
and
awe
and
georgette
saw
frown
stiffen
his
limbs
clench
his
fists
and
push
the
massive
quarto
off
the
desk
it
is
really
quite
tragical
to
see
a
stably
old
book
treated
with
such
disrespect
the
heavy
volume
pushed
from
its
hung
a
moment
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
hesitating
as
if
it
were
trying
to
keep
its
balance
then
it
fell
crumpled
and
torn
with
disjointed
clasps
and
loosened
from
its
binding
all
flattened
out
upon
the
floor
luckily
it
did
not
fall
on
the
children
they
were
startled
but
not
crushed
the
results
of
conquest
have
sometimes
proved
more
fatal
like
all
glories
it
was
accompanied
by
a
loud
noise
and
a
cloud
of
dust
having
upset
the
book
now
came
down
from
the
chair
for
a
moment
silence
and
dismay
prevailed
for
victory
has
its
terrors
the
three
children
clung
to
one
another
hands
and
gazed
from
a
distance
upon
the
ruins
of
this
monstrous
volume
after
a
brief
pause
however
went
up
to
it
with
an
air
of
determination
and
gave
it
a
kick
this
was
quite
enough
the
appetite
for
destruction
is
never
sated
gave
it
a
kick
too
and
georgette
gave
it
another
which
landed
her
on
the
floor
but
in
a
sitting
position
of
which
she
at
once
took
advantage
to
throw
herself
on
saint
bartholomew
all
respect
was
now
at
an
end
and
pounced
upon
it
jubilant
wild
with
excitement
triumphant
and
pitiless
tearing
the
prints
slashing
the
leaves
tearing
out
the
markers
scratching
the
binding
detaching
the
gilded
leather
pulling
the
nails
from
the
silver
corners
breaking
the
parchment
defacing
the
noble
text
working
with
hands
feet
nails
and
teeth
rosy
laughing
and
fierce
they
fell
upon
the
defenceless
evangelist
like
three
angels
of
prey
they
annihilated
armenia
judea
and
benevento
where
the
relics
of
the
saint
are
to
be
found
nathanael
who
is
supposed
by
some
authorities
to
be
the
same
as
bartholomew
pope
gelasius
who
declared
the
gospel
of
apocryphal
and
every
portrait
and
map
indeed
they
were
so
utterly
engrossed
in
their
pitiless
destruction
of
the
old
book
that
a
mouse
ran
by
unobserved
it
might
well
be
called
extermination
to
cut
to
pieces
history
legend
science
miracles
true
or
false
ecclesiastical
latin
superstition
fanaticism
and
mysteries
thus
to
tear
a
whole
religion
to
tatters
might
be
considered
a
work
of
time
for
three
giants
and
even
for
three
children
it
was
no
small
matter
they
labored
for
hours
but
at
last
they
conquered
and
nothing
remained
of
when
they
came
to
the
end
when
the
last
page
was
detached
and
the
last
print
thrown
on
the
floor
when
all
that
was
left
in
the
skeleton
binding
were
fragments
of
text
and
tattered
portraits
rose
to
his
feet
looked
at
the
floor
all
strewn
with
scattered
leaves
and
clapped
his
hands
in
triumph
immediately
did
the
same
georgette
rose
picked
up
a
leaf
from
the
floor
leaned
against
the
that
was
just
on
a
level
with
her
chin
and
began
to
tear
the
big
page
into
tiny
bits
and
throw
them
out
of
the
window
when
and
saw
what
she
was
doing
they
were
at
once
eager
to
follow
her
example
and
picking
up
the
pages
they
tore
them
over
and
over
again
page
by
page
and
threw
the
fragments
outside
the
window
as
she
had
done
thus
almost
the
whole
of
that
ancient
book
torn
by
those
destructive
little
fingers
went
flying
to
the
winds
georgette
dreamily
watched
the
fluttering
groups
of
tiny
white
papers
blown
about
by
every
wind
and
cried
butterflies
and
here
ended
the
massacre
its
last
traces
vanishing
in
thin
air
illustration
vii
thus
for
the
second
time
was
saint
bartholomew
put
to
death
he
who
had
already
suffered
martyrdom
in
the
year
of
our
lord
meanwhile
the
evening
was
drawing
on
and
as
the
heat
increased
a
certain
drowsiness
pervaded
the
atmosphere
georgette
eyes
were
growing
heavy
went
to
his
crib
pulled
out
the
sack
of
straw
that
served
him
for
a
mattress
dragged
it
to
the
window
and
stretching
himself
out
upon
it
said
let
us
go
to
bed
leaned
his
head
against
georgette
laid
hers
on
and
thus
the
three
culprits
fell
sound
asleep
warm
breezes
stole
in
at
the
open
windows
the
scent
of
borne
upon
the
wind
from
the
ravines
and
hills
mingled
with
the
breath
of
evening
nature
lay
calm
and
sympathetic
radiance
peace
and
love
pervaded
the
world
the
sunlight
touched
each
object
with
a
soft
caress
and
one
felt
in
every
pore
of
his
being
the
harmony
that
springs
from
the
profound
tenderness
of
inanimate
things
infinity
holds
within
itself
the
essence
of
motherhood
creation
is
a
miracle
in
full
bloom
whose
magnitude
is
perfected
by
its
benevolence
one
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
an
invisible
presence
exercising
its
mysterious
influence
in
the
dread
conflict
between
created
beings
protecting
the
helpless
against
the
powerful
beauty
meanwhile
on
every
side
its
splendor
only
to
be
equalled
by
its
tenderness
the
landscape
calm
and
peaceful
displayed
the
enchanting
hazy
effects
of
light
and
shade
over
the
fields
and
river
the
smoke
rose
upwards
to
the
clouds
like
reveries
melting
into
dreams
flocks
of
birds
circled
above
the
tourgue
the
swallows
peeped
in
at
the
windows
as
much
as
to
say
we
have
come
to
see
if
the
children
are
sleeping
comfortably
and
pure
and
lovable
they
looked
as
they
lay
motionless
prettily
grouped
like
little
cupids
their
united
ages
amounting
to
less
than
nine
years
vague
smiles
hovered
round
their
lips
reflecting
dreams
of
paradise
perchance
almighty
god
was
whispering
in
their
ears
since
they
were
of
those
whom
all
human
tongues
unite
to
call
the
weak
and
the
blessed
theirs
was
the
innocence
that
commands
veneration
all
was
silent
as
if
the
breath
that
stirred
those
tender
bosoms
were
the
business
of
the
universe
and
all
creation
paused
to
listen
not
a
leaf
rustled
not
a
blade
of
grass
quivered
it
seemed
as
if
the
wide
starry
universe
held
its
breath
lest
these
three
lowly
but
angelic
slumberers
should
be
disturbed
and
nothing
could
be
more
sublime
than
the
impressive
reverence
of
nature
in
the
presence
of
this
insignificance
the
declining
sun
had
nearly
reached
the
horizon
when
suddenly
amid
this
profound
peace
lightning
flashed
from
the
forest
followed
by
a
savage
report
a
cannon
had
just
been
fired
the
echoes
seized
this
sound
and
magnified
it
to
a
dreadful
din
and
so
frightful
was
the
prolonged
reverberation
from
hill
to
hill
that
it
roused
georgette
she
raised
her
head
a
little
lifted
her
finger
listened
then
said
boom
the
noise
ceased
and
silence
returned
again
georgette
put
her
head
back
on
and
fell
asleep
again

that
evening
the
mother
whom
we
have
seen
wandering
onward
with
no
settled
plan
had
walked
all
day
long
this
was
to
be
sure
a
matter
of
occurrence
she
kept
on
her
way
without
pause
or
rest
for
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
in
some
chance
corner
could
no
more
be
called
rest
than
could
the
stray
crumbs
that
she
picked
up
here
and
there
like
the
birds
be
considered
nourishment
she
ate
and
slept
just
enough
to
keep
her
alive
she
had
spent
the
previous
night
in
a
forsaken
barn
a
wreck
such
as
civil
wars
leave
behind
them
in
a
deserted
field
she
had
found
four
walls
an
open
door
a
little
straw
and
the
remains
of
a
roof
and
on
this
straw
beneath
the
roof
she
threw
herself
down
feeling
the
rats
glide
under
as
she
lay
there
and
watching
the
stars
rise
through
the
roof
she
slept
several
hours
then
waking
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
resumed
her
journey
so
as
to
get
over
as
much
ground
as
possible
before
the
excessive
heat
of
the
day
came
on
for
the
summer
pedestrian
midnight
is
more
favorable
than
noon
she
followed
as
best
she
could
the
brief
directions
given
her
by
the
vautortes
peasant
and
kept
as
far
as
possible
toward
the
west
had
there
been
any
one
near
he
might
have
heard
her
incessantly
muttering
half
aloud
la
tourgue
she
seemed
to
know
no
other
word
save
the
names
of
her
children
and
as
she
walked
she
dreamed
she
thought
of
the
adventures
that
had
befallen
her
of
all
she
had
suffered
and
endured
of
the
encounters
the
indignities
the
conditions
imposed
the
bargains
offered
and
accepted
now
for
a
shelter
now
for
a
bit
of
bread
or
simply
to
be
directed
on
her
way
a
wretched
woman
is
more
unfortunate
than
a
wretched
man
inasmuch
as
she
is
the
instrument
of
pleasure
terrible
indeed
was
this
wandering
journey
but
all
this
would
count
for
nothing
if
she
could
but
find
her
children
on
that
day
her
first
adventure
was
in
a
village
through
which
her
route
lay
the
dawn
was
barely
breaking
and
the
dusk
of
night
still
shrouded
all
the
surrounding
objects
but
in
the
principal
village
street
a
few
doors
were
half
open
and
curious
faces
peeped
out
of
the
windows
the
inhabitants
seemed
restless
like
a
startled
hive
of
bees
a
disturbance
due
to
the
noise
of
wheels
and
the
clanking
of
iron
which
had
reached
their
ears
on
the
square
in
front
of
the
church
a
frightened
group
was
staring
at
some
object
that
was
descending
the
hill
towards
the
village
it
was
a
wagon
drawn
by
five
horses
whose
harness
was
composed
of
chains
and
upon
which
could
be
seen
something
that
looked
like
a
pile
of
long
joists
in
the
middle
of
which
lay
an
object
whose
vague
outlines
were
hidden
by
a
large
canvas
resembling
a
pall
ten
horsemen
rode
in
front
of
the
wagon
and
ten
behind
they
wore
hats
and
above
their
shoulders
rose
what
seemed
like
the
points
of
naked
sabres
the
whole
procession
advanced
slowly
its
dark
outlines
sharply
defined
against
the
horizon
everything
looked
black
the
wagon
the
harness
and
the
riders
on
entering
the
village
they
approached
the
square
with
the
pale
glimmer
of
the
dawn
behind
them
it
had
grown
somewhat
lighter
while
the
wagon
was
descending
the
hill
and
now
the
escort
was
plainly
to
be
seen
a
procession
of
ghosts
to
ail
intents
for
no
man
uttered
a
word
the
horsemen
were
gendarmes
they
really
were
carrying
drawn
sabres
and
the
canvas
that
covered
the
wagon
was
black
the
wretched
wandering
mother
entering
the
village
from
the
opposite
direction
just
as
the
wagon
and
the
gendarmes
reached
the
square
approached
the
crowd
of
peasants
and
heard
voices
whispering
the
following
questions
and
answers
what
is
that
it
the
guillotine
where
does
it
come
from
from
fougères
where
is
it
going
i
do
know
they
say
it
is
going
to
some
castle
near
parigné
parigné
let
it
go
wherever
it
will
so
that
it
does
not
stop
here
there
was
something
ghostlike
in
the
combination
of
this
great
wagon
with
its
shrouded
burden
the
gendarmes
the
clanking
chains
of
the
team
and
the
silent
men
in
the
early
dawn
the
group
crossed
the
square
and
passed
out
from
the
village
which
lay
in
a
hollow
between
two
hills
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
peasants
who
had
stood
there
like
men
petrified
saw
the
funereal
procession
reappear
on
the
summit
of
the
western
hill
the
great
wheels
jolted
in
the
ruts
the
chains
of
the
harness
rattled
as
they
were
shaken
by
the
early
morning
wind
the
sabres
shone
the
sun
was
rising
and
at
a
bend
of
the
road
all
vanished
from
the
sight
it
was
at
this
very
moment
that
georgette
woke
up
in
the
library
beside
her
still
sleeping
brothers
and
wished
her
rosy
feet
ii
death
speaks
the
mother
had
watched
this
dark
object
as
it
passed
by
but
she
neither
understood
nor
tried
to
understand
it
absorbed
as
she
was
in
the
vision
that
pictured
her
children
lost
in
the
darkness
she
too
left
the
village
soon
after
the
procession
which
had
just
passed
and
followed
the
same
road
at
some
distance
behind
the
second
squad
of
gendarmes
suddenly
the
word
guillotine
came
back
to
her
and
she
repeated
it
to
herself
now
this
untaught
peasant
woman
michelle
fléchard
had
no
idea
of
its
meaning
but
her
instinct
warned
her
she
shuddered
involuntarily
and
it
seemed
dreadful
to
her
to
be
walking
behind
it
so
she
turned
to
the
left
quitting
the
highway
and
entered
a
wood
which
was
the
forest
of
fougères
after
roaming
about
for
some
time
she
spied
a
belfry
and
the
roofs
of
houses
evidently
a
village
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
she
went
towards
it
for
she
was
hungry
it
was
one
of
those
hamlets
where
the
republicans
had
established
a
military
outpost
she
went
as
far
as
the
square
in
front
of
the
here
too
there
was
agitation
and
anxiety
a
crowd
had
gathered
in
front
of
the
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
hall
and
here
standing
on
one
of
these
steps
was
a
man
accompanied
by
soldiers
who
held
in
his
hand
a
large
unfolded
placard
a
drummer
stood
on
his
right
and
on
his
left
a
with
his
brush
and
upon
the
balcony
over
the
door
stood
the
mayor
wearing
a
tricolored
scarf
over
his
peasant
dress
illustration
the
man
with
the
placard
was
a
public
crier
he
wore
a
from
which
hung
a
small
wallet
in
token
that
he
was
going
from
village
to
village
proclaiming
certain
news
throughout
the
district
just
as
michelle
fléchard
arrived
he
had
unfolded
the
placard
and
was
beginning
to
read
in
a
loud
voice
the
french
republic
one
and
indivisible
the
drum
beat
there
was
a
stir
in
the
crowd
a
few
took
off
their
caps
others
jammed
their
hats
more
firmly
on
their
heads
in
those
times
one
could
almost
recognize
a
man
political
views
throughout
that
district
by
the
fashion
of
his
hats
were
worn
by
royalists
caps
by
republicans
the
confused
murmur
of
voices
ceased
and
all
listened
as
the
crier
proceeded
to
read
by
virtue
of
the
orders
given
to
as
and
of
the
authority
vested
in
us
by
the
committee
of
public
safety
again
the
drum
beat
and
again
the
crier
continued
and
in
execution
of
the
decree
of
the
national
convention
that
outlaws
all
rebels

with

in
their

and

that
capital
punishment

be
inflicted
on
any
man
who
harbors
them
or
aids
and
abets
in
their
escape
one
peasant
whispered
to
his
neighbor
what
does
capital
punishment
mean
i
do
know
the
neighbor
replied
the
crier
waved
the
placard
in
accordance
with
article
of
the
law
of
the
of
april
that
gives
to
the
delegates
and
full
authority
over

he
made
a
pause
then
resumed
the
individuals

under
the
following
names
and
surnames

declared

the
audience
listened
with
a
close
attention

mutterings
among
the
peasants
michelle
fléchard
had
mingled
with
the
crowd
she
had
not
listened
but
some
things
one
may
hear
without
listening
she
had
heard
the
word
tourgue
and
raised
her
head
what
that
did
he
say
la
tourgue
people
looked
at
her
the
ragged
woman
seemed
like
one
dazed
voices
were
heard
to
murmur
she
looks
like
a
brigand
a
peasant
woman
carrying
a
basket
of
buckwheat
cakes
went
up
to
her
and
whispered

michelle
fléchard
stared
stupidly
again
she
had
lost
all
power
of
comprehension
that
name
la
tourgue
passed
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
night
closed
once
more
had
she
no
right
to
ask
for
information

so
strangely

went
back
into

for

village
and
the
crowd
dispensed
one
group
was
still
standing
in

of
the
notice
michelle

drew
near
they
were
commenting
on
the

thing
to
say
as
if
a
living
woman
were
to
call
herself
dead
people
looked
at
her
suspiciously
and
truly
she
was
a
startling
object
trembling
at
every
sound
shivering
with
an
fear
so
terrified
was
she
that
she
frightened
other
people
there
is
a
certain
weakness
in
the
despair
of
a
woman
that
is
dreadful
to
witness
it
is
like
looking
upon
a
being
against
whom
destiny
has
done
its
worst
but
peasants
are
not
analytical
they
see
nothing
below
the
surface
one
of
them
muttered
she
might
be
a
spy
keep
still
and
go
away
whispered
the
woman
who
had
spoken
to
her
before
i
am
doing
no
harm
replied
michelle
fléchard
i
am
only
looking
for
my
children
the
kind
woman
winked
at
those
who
were
starring
at
michelle
fléchard
and
touching
her
forehead
with
her
finger
said
she
is
a
simpleton
then
drawing
her
aside
she
gave
her
a
buckwheat
cake
without
even
stopping
to
thank
her
michelle
fléchard
began
to
devour
the
cake
like
one
ravenous
for
food
you
see
she
eats
just
like
an
animal
she
must
be
a
simpleton
and
one
by
one
the
crowd
gradually
dispersed
after
she
had
eaten
michelle
fléchard
said
to
the
peasant
woman
well
i
have
finished
my
cake
now
where
is
the
tourgue
there
she
is
at
it
again
cried
the
peasant
woman
i
must
go

tourgue

me
the
road

la
tourgue
never
cried
the
peasant
woman

would

the
way

surely
be
insane

me
my
poor
woman

tired

come
to
my
house
and
rest
i
never
test
replied
the
mother
and
her
feet
are
all
torn
muttered
the
peasant
woman
did
you
hear
me
telling
you
that
my
children
were
stolen
from
me
one
little
girl
and
two
little
boys
i
came
from
the
in
the
forest
you
can
ask
tellmarch
le
caimand
about
me
and
also
the
man
i
met
in
the
field
down
yonder
the
caimand
cared
me

seems
i
had
something
broken
all
those
things
really
happened
besides
there
is
sergeant
radoub
you

ask
him

will
tell
you
for
it
was
he
who

the
forest

i

three
children

the
oldest
one

prove
it
to
you
and

georgette

the
two
others
my
husband

dead
they
killed
him
he
was
a
farmer
at
siscoignard
you
look
like
a
kind
woman
show
me
the
way
i
am
not
mad
i
am
a
mother
i
have
lost
my
children
and
am
looking
for
them
i
do
not
know
exactly
where
i
came
from
i
slept
last
night
on
the
straw
in
a
barn
i
am
going
to
the
tourgue
i
am
not
a
thief

that
i
am
telling
you
the
truth

ought
to
help
me
to
find
my
children
i
do
belong
to
this
neighborhood
i
have
been
shot
but
i
do
not
know
where
it
happened
the
peasant
woman
shook
her
head
saying
listen
traveller
in
times
of
revolution
you
must
not
say
things
that
can
not
be
understood
for
you
might
be
arrested
but
the
tourgue
cried
the
mother
madam
for
the
love
of
the
infant
jesus
and
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
paradise
i
pray
you
i
beg
of
you
i
beseech
you
madam
tell
me
how
i
can
find
the
road
to
the
tourgue
then
the
peasant
woman
grew
angry
i
do
know
and
if
i
did
i
would
not
tell
you
it
is
a
bad
place
people
do
go
there
but
i
am
going
there
said
the
mother
and
once
more
she
started
on
her
way
the
woman
as
she
watched
her
depart
muttered
to
herself
she
must
have
something
to
eat
whatever
she
does
and
running
after
michelle
fléchard
she
put
a
cake
in
her
hand
saying
there
is
something
for
your
supper
michelle
fléchard
took
the
but
she
neither
turned
nor
made
reply
as
she
pursued
her
way
she
went
forth
from
the
village
and
just
as
she
reached
the
last
houses
she
met
three
little
ragged
and
barefooted
children
trotting
along
she
went
up
to
them
and
said
here
are
two
boys
and
a
girl
and
when
she
saw
them
looking
at
her
bread
she
gave
it
to
them
the
children
took
the
bread
but
they
were
evidently
frightened
she
entered
the
forest
iv
a
mistake
meanwhile
on
this
very
day
before
dawn
amid
the
dim
shadows
of
the
forest
the
following
scene
took
place
on
the
bit
of
road
that
leads
from
javené
to
lécousse
all
the
roads
of
the
bocage
are
shut
in
between
high
banks
and
those
enclosing
the
one
that
runs
from
javené
to
parigné
by
way
of
lécousse
are
even
higher
than
usual
indeed
the
road
winding
as
it
does
might
well
be
called
a
ravine
it
leads
from
vitré
and
has
had
the
honor
of
jolting
madame
de
sévigné
carriage
shut
in
as
it
is
by
hedges
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
no
better
spot
for
an
ambush
could
well
be
found
that
morning
one
hour
before
michelle
fléchard
starting
from
a
different
part
of
the
forest
had
reached
the
first
village
where
she
beheld
the
funereal
apparition
of
the
wagon
escorted
by
the
gendarmes
a
crowd
of
unseen
men
concealed
by
the
branches
crouched
in
the
thickets
through
which
the
road
from
javené
runs
after
it
crosses
the
bridge
over
the
couesnon
they
were
peasants
dressed
in
coats
of
skin
such
as
were
worn
by
the
kings
of
brittany
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
by
the
peasants
in
the
eighteenth
some
were
armed
with
muskets
others
with
axes
those
who
had
axes
had
just
built
in
a
glade
a
kind
of
funeral
pile
of
dry
fagots
and
logs
which
was
only
waiting
to
be
set
on
fire
those
who
had
muskets
were
posted
on
both
sides
of
the
road
in
the
attitude
of
expectancy
could
one
have
seen
through
the
leaves
he
might
have
discovered
on
every
side
fingers
resting
on
triggers
and
guns
aimed
through
the
openings
made
by
the
interlacing
of
the
branches
these
men
were
lying
in
wait
all
the
muskets
converged
towards
the
road
which
had
begun
to
whiten
in
the
rising
dawn
amid
this
twilight
low
voices
were
carrying
on
a
dialogue
are
you
sure
of
this
well
that
what
they
say
she
is
about
to
go
by
they
say
she
is
in
this
neighborhood
she
must
not
leave
it
she
must
be
burned
we
three
villages
have
come
out
for
that
very
purpose
and
how
about
the
escort
it
is
to
be
killed
but
will
she
come
by
this
road
so
they
say
then
she
is
coming
from
vitré
and
why
should
she
because
they
said
she
was
coming
from
fougères
whether
she
comes
from
fougères
or
from
vitré
she
certainly
comes
from
the
devil
that
is
true
and
she
must
go
back
to
him
i
agree
to
that
then
she
is
going
to
parigné
so
it
seems
she
will
not
get
there
no
no
no
no
attention
it
was
the
part
of
prudence
to
be
silent
now
since
it
was
growing
quite
light
suddenly
these
men
lurking
in
ambush
held
their
breath
as
they
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
and
horses
feet
peering
through
the
branches
they
caught
an
indistinct
glimpse
of
a
long
wagon
a
mounted
escort
and
something
on
the
top
of
the
wagon
all
of
which
was
coming
towards
them
along
the
hollow
road
there
she
is
cried
the
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
leader
yes
and
the
escort
too
said
one
of
the
men
who
lay
in
wait
how
many
are
there
twelve
it
was
said
that
there
were
to
be
twenty
twelve
or
twenty
let
us
kill
them
all
wait
till
they
are
within
our
reach
illustration
a
little
later
and
the
wagon
with
its
escort
appeared
at
a
turn
of
the
road
long
live
the
king
cried
the
peasant
leader
and
as
he
spoke
a
hundred
muskets
were
fired
at
the
same
instant
when
the
smoke
scattered
the
escort
was
scattered
likewise
seven
horsemen
had
fallen
and
the
other
five
had
made
their
escape
the
peasants
rushed
to
the
wagon
hallo
this
is
not
the
guillotine
cried
the
leader
it
a
ladder
in
fact
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
the
wagon
but
a
long
ladder
the
two
wounded
horses
had
fallen
and
the
driver
had
been
killed
by
accident
there
is
something
suspicious
about
a
ladder
with
an
escort
all
the
same
said
the
leader
it
was
going
in
the
direction
of
parigné
no
doubt
it
was
intended
for
scaling
the
tourgue
let
us
burn
the
ladder
cried
the
peasants
as
to
the
funereal
wagon
for
which
they
were
watching
it
had
taken
another
road
and
was
already
two
miles
farther
away
in
the
village
where
michelle
fléchard
had
seen
it
pass
at
sunrise
vox
in
deserto
after
leaving
the
three
children
to
whom
she
had
given
her
bread
michelle
fléchard
started
at
random
through
the
woods
since
no
one
would
show
her
the
way
she
must
find
it
without
help
from
time
to
time
she
paused
and
sat
down
to
rest
then
up
and
away
again
she
was
overcome
by
that
intense
weariness
which
one
feels
first
in
the
muscles
then
in
the
bones
like
the
fatigue
of
a
slave
and
a
slave
indeed
she
was
the
slave
of
her
lost
children
they
must
be
found
each
passing
moment
might
be
fatal
to
them
a
duty
like
this
debars
one
from
the
right
to
breathe
freely
yet
she
was
very
weary
when
one
has
reached
this
stage
of
fatigue
it
becomes
a
question
whether
another
step
can
be
taken
could
she
do
it
she
had
been
walking
since
morning
without
finding
either
a
village
or
a
house
when
she
first
started
she
had
followed
the
right
path
but
soon
wandered
into
the
wrong
one
and
at
last
quite
lost
her
way
among
the
thick
branches
where
one
tree
looked
just
like
another
was
she
drawing
near
her
goal
were
her
sufferings
almost
over
she
was
following
the
way
of
the
cross
and
felt
all
the
languor
and
exhaustion
of
the
final
station
was
she
doomed
to
fall
dead
on
the
road
at
one
time
it
seemed
to
her
impossible
to
take
another
step
the
sun
was
low
the
forest
dark
the
paths
no
longer
visible
in
the
grass
and
god
only
knew
what
was
to
become
of
her
she
began
to
call
but
there
was
no
reply
looking
around
she
perceived
an
opening
among
the
branches
and
no
sooner
had
she
started
in
that
direction
than
she
found
herself
out
of
the
wood
before
her
lay
a
valley
no
wider
than
a
trench
across
whose
stony
bottom
flowed
a
slender
stream
of
clear
water
then
she
realized
that
she
was
excessively
thirsty
and
approaching
it
knelt
to
drink
and
while
thus
kneeling
she
thought
she
would
say
her
prayers
when
she
rose
she
tried
to
get
her
bearings
and
crossed
the
brook
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
on
the
farther
side
of
the
little
valley
stretched
a
limitless
plain
overgrown
with
a
stubbly
underbrush
which
rose
from
the
brook
like
an
inclined
plane
occupying
the
entire
horizon
if
the
forest
were
a
solitude
this
plateau
might
be
called
a
desert
in
the
forest
there
was
a
chance
that
one
might
encounter
a
human
being
behind
any
bush
but
across
the
plateau
not
an
object
could
be
descried
within
reach
of
human
vision
a
few
birds
were
flying
across
the
heather
as
if
making
an
effort
to
escape
then
in
the
presence
of
this
utter
desolation
feeling
her
knees
give
way
beneath
her
the
poor
bewildered
mother
cried
out
amid
the
solitude
like
one
suddenly
gone
mad
is
there
no
one
here
she
paused
for
an
answer
and
the
answer
came
a
deep
and
muffled
voice
burst
forth
from
the
distant
horizon
caught
and
repeated
by
echo
upon
echo
it
was
like
a
thunderbolt
but
it
might
have
been
the
firing
of
a
cannon
or
a
voice
answering
the
question
and
replying
yes
then
silence
reigned
once
more
the
mother
rose
with
renewed
energy
she
felt
reassured
by
a
sense
of
companionship
having
quenched
her
thirst
and
said
her
prayers
her
strength
returned
and
she
began
to
climb
the
plateau
in
the
direction
from
whence
the
voice
of
distant
thunder
had
reached
her
ears
suddenly
she
caught
sight
of
a
lofty
tower
looming
up
against
the
horizon
it
stood
alone
amid
this
wild
landscape
and
a
ray
of
the
setting
sun
cast
a
crimson
glow
across
it
it
was
more
than
a
league
away
beyond
it
stretched
the
forest
of
fougères
its
vast
expanse
of
verdure
half
hidden
by
the
mist
could
it
have
been
this
tower
that
made
the
noise
for
it
seemed
to
her
to
stand
on
the
very
spot
whence
came
the
thundering
sound
that
had
rung
in
her
ears
like
a
call
michelle
fléchard
had
now
reached
the
summit
of
the
plateau
and
the
plain
alone
lay
before
her
vi
the
situation
the
moment
had
finally
come
when
cimourdain
held
lantenac
in
his
grasp
the
inexorable
had
conquered
the
pitiless
the
old
rebel
royalist
was
caught
in
his
own
lair
with
no
possible
chance
of
escape
and
cimourdain
had
determined
to
behead
the
marquis
in
the
home
of
his
ancestors
on
his
own
estate
upon
his
very
hearthstone
so
to
speak
that
the
feudal
mansion
might
look
upon
the
downfall
of
its
feudal
lord
and
thus
present
an
example
not
soon
to
be
forgotten
for
this
reason
he
sent
to
fougères
for
the
guillotine
which
we
saw
on
its
way
to
kill
lantenac
was
to
kill
the
vendée
the
death
of
the
vendée
meant
safety
for
france
cimourdain
was
a
man
utterly
calm
in
the
performance
of
duty
however
ferocious
it
might
be
and
not
for
a
moment
did
he
hesitate
illustration
in
regard
to
the
ruin
of
the
marquis
he
felt
quite
at
ease
but
he
had
another
cause
for
anxiety
the
struggle
would
no
doubt
be
a
fearful
one
gauvain
would
direct
the
assault
and
perhaps
take
part
in
it
this
young
chief
had
all
the
fire
of
a
soldier
he
was
the
very
man
to
throw
himself
headlong
into
this
encounter
and
what
if
he
were
killed
gauvain
his
child
the
only
being
on
earth
whom
he
loved
gauvain
had
been
fortunate
thus
far
but
fortune
sometimes
grows
weary
cimourdain
trembled
strange
enough
was
his
destiny
thus
placed
between
these
two
gauvains
longing
for
the
death
of
the
one
and
praying
for
the
life
of
the
other
the
cannon
that
had
started
georgette
in
her
cradle
and
summoned
the
mother
from
the
depths
of
the
woods
did
more
than
that
whether
by
accident
or
intentionally
on
the
part
of
the
man
who
pointed
the
gun
the
ball
though
intended
only
as
a
warning
struck
broke
and
partly
wrenched
away
the
iron
bars
that
defended
and
closed
the
great
on
the
first
floor
of
the
tower
and
the
besieged
had
had
no
time
to
repair
this
damage
the
truth
was
that
in
spite
of
their
loud
boasting
their
ammunition
was
nearly
exhausted
and
their
situation
let
it
be
remembered
was
more
critical
than
the
besiegers
suspected
their
dream
had
been
to
blow
up
the
tourgue
when
the
enemy
was
once
fairly
within
the
walls
but
their
store
of
powder
was
running
low
not
more
than
thirty
rounds
left
for
each
man
they
had
plenty
of
muskets
blunderbusses
and
pistols
but
few
cartridges
all
the
guns
were
loaded
that
they
might
keep
up
a
steady
fire
but
how
long
could
this
last
to
keep
up
the
firing
and
economize
their
resources
at
one
and
the
same
time
would
be
a
somewhat
difficult
combination
fortunately
a
gloomy
kind
of
fortune
it
would
be
for
the
most
part
a
encounter
in
which
the
cold
steel
of
sabre
and
dagger
would
take
the
place
of
firearms
they
would
have
a
chance
to
hack
the
enemy
in
pieces
and
therein
lay
their
chief
hope
the
interior
of
the
tower
seemed
impregnable
in
the
low
hall
where
the
breach
had
been
made
the
entrance
was
defended
by
that
barricade
so
skilfully
constructed
by
lantenac
called
that
behind
it
stood
a
long
table
covered
with
loaded
weapons
blunderbusses
carbines
muskets
sabres
hatchets
and
daggers
having
been
unable
to
make
use
of
the
oubliette
prison
communicating
with
the
lower
hall
for
the
purpose
of
blowing
up
the
tower
the
marquis
had
ordered
the
door
of
this
dungeon
to
be
closed
above
the
hall
was
the
round
chamber
of
the
first
story
which
could
only
be
reached
by
a
very
narrow
spiral
staircase
this
room
provided
like
the
lower
hall
with
a
table
covered
with
weapons
ready
for
use
was
lighted
by
the
wide
embrasure
whose
grating
had
just
been
crushed
by
a
below
this
room
the
spiral
staircase
led
to
the
round
chamber
on
the
second
story
from
which
the
iron
door
opened
into
the
this
room
on
the
second
floor
was
called
indiscriminately
the
room
with
the
iron
door
or
the
mirror
room
on
account
of
the
numerous
little
mirrors
hung
from
rusty
old
nails
against
the
naked
stone
walls
an
odd
medley
of
elegance
and
barbarism
as
there
were
no
means
by
which
the
upper
rooms
could
be
successfully
defended
this
was
what
the
authority
on
fortifications
calls
the
last
post
where
the
besieged
may
capitulate
the
object
was
as
we
have
already
stated
to
prevent
the
besiegers
from
reaching
it
this
round
chamber
on
the
second
floor
was
lighted
by
embrasures
but
a
torch
was
burning
there
also
this
torch
stuck
in
an
iron
like
the
one
in
the
lower
hall
had
been
lighted
by
the
imânus
and
placed
quite
near
the
end
of
the
appalling
solicitude
at
the
end
of
the
hall
on
a
long
board
raised
on
trestles
food
had
been
placed
as
in
a
homeric
cavern
great
dishes
of
rice
a
porridge
of
some
kind
of
dark
grain
hashed
veal
a
boiled
pudding
made
of
flour
and
fruit
and
jugs
of
cider
whoever
wished
to
eat
and
drink
could
do
so
the
cannon
had
set
them
all
on
the
alert
and
now
they
had
but
half
an
hour
of
repose
before
them
from
the
top
of
the
tower
the
imânus
kept
watch
of
the
approach
lantenac
had
given
orders
that
the
besiegers
should
be
allowed
to
advance
unmolested
they
are
four
thousand
five
hundred
he
said
it
would
be
useless
to
kill
them
outside
wait
till
they
are
within
the
walls
where
we
shall
be
equal
to
them
and
he
added
laughing
equality
fraternity
it
had
been
agreed
that
when
the
enemy
began
to
advance
the
imânus
should
give
warning
on
his
horn
posted
behind
the
and
on
the
steps
of
the
staircase
they
waited
in
silence
with
a
musket
in
one
hand
and
a
rosary
in
the
other
the
situation
might
be
summed
up
as
follows
on
one
side
of
the
besiegers
a
breach
to
scale
a
barricade
to
carry
three
rooms
in
succession
one
above
the
other
to
be
taken
by
main
force
two
spiral
staircases
to
be
climbed
step
by
step
under
a
shower
of
bullets

besieged

gauvain
on
his
side
was
preparing
for
the
attack
he
had
given
his
last
instructions
to
cimourdain
who
it
will
be
remembered
was
to
guard
the
plateau
taking
no
part
in
the
action
as
well
as
to
guéchamp
who
with
the
main
body
of
the
army
was
to
be
stationed
in
the
forest
camp
it
was
agreed
that
neither
the
lower
battery
of
the
wood
nor
the
higher
one
of
the
plateau
was
to
fire
unless
a
sortie
or
an
attempt
to
escape
were
made
gauvain
reserved
for
himself
the
command
of
the
storming
column
and
this
it
was
that
troubled
cimourdain
the
sun
had
just
set
a
tower
in
the
open
country
is
like
a
ship
in
and
must
be
attacked
in
the
same
way
it
is
more
like
boarding
than
assaulting
cannon
is
of
no
avail
for
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
cannonade
walls
fifteen
feet
thick
a
through
which
men
struggle
to
force
a
way
while
others
defend
the
entrance
with
axes
knives
pistols
fists
and
teeth
this
was
the
kind
of
combat
that
might
be
expected
and
gauvain
knew
that
by
no
other
means
could
the
tourgue
be
taken
nothing
can
be
more
deadly
than
an
attack
where
the
combatants
can
look
into
one
another
eyes
he
was
familiar
with
the
formidable
interior
of
the
tower
having
lived
there
as
a
child
he
stood
wrapped
in
deep
thought
a
few
paces
from
him
his
lieutenant
guéchamp
with
a
in
his
hand
was
scanning
the
horizon
in
the
direction
of
parigné
suddenly
he
cried
ah
at
last
this
exclamation
roused
gauvain
from
his
reverie
what
is
it
guéchamp
the
ladder
is
coming
commander
the
yes
is
it
possible
that
it
has
not
arrived
till
now
no
commander
and
i
felt
anxious
about
it
the
courier
whom
i
sent
to
javené
returned
i
am
aware
of
that
he
reported
that
he
had
found
in
a
at
javené
a
ladder
of
the
required
dimensions
that
he
had
taken
possession
of
it
and
having
had
it
put
on
a
wagon
demanded
an
escort
of
twelve
horsemen
that
he
had
waited
to
see
them
set
out
for
parigné
the
wagon
the
escort
and
the
ladder
and
had
then
started
for
home
at
full
speed
and
reported
the
same
to
us
adding
that
the
team
was
a
good
one
and
had
started
about
two
in
the
morning
and
would
therefore
be
here
before
sunset
yes
i
know
all
that
what
else
well
commander
the
sun
has
just
set
and
the
wagon
that
is
to
bring
the
ladder
has
not
yet
arrived
is
it
possible
but
we
must
begin
the
attack
the
hour
has
come
if
we
are
late
the
besieged
will
think
that
we
have
retreated
we
can
attack
commander
but
we
must
have
the
certainly
but
we
have
not
got
it
yes
we
have
how
is
that
that
what
made
me
say
at
last
as
the
wagon
had
not
arrived
i
took
my
and
have
been
watching
the
road
from
parigné
to
the
tourgue
and
now
i
am
content
for
the
wagon
and
the
escort
are
yonder
descending
the
hill
you
can
see
them
gauvain
took
the
and
looked
yes
there
it
is
it
is
hardly
light
enough
to
see
it
all
distinctly
but
i
can
distinguish
the
escort
it
is
certainly
that
only
it
seems
to
me
larger
than
you
said
guéchamp
yes
it
does
they
are
about
a
quarter
of
a
league
distant
the
will
be
here
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
commander
then
we
can
attack
it
was
indeed
a
wagon
approaching
but
not
the
one
they
supposed
it
to
be
as
he
turned
gauvain
saw
behind
him
sergeant
radoub
standing
with
downcast
eyes
in
the
attitude
of
military
salute
what
is
it
sergeant
radoub
citizen
commander
we
the
men
of
the
battalion
of
the
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
what
is
it
to
be
killed
ah
exclaimed
gauvain
will
you
grant
us
this
favor
well
that
depends
said
gauvain
it
is
just
this
commander
since
the
affair
at
dol
you
have
been
too
careful
of
us
there
are
twelve
of
us
still
well
it
humiliates
us
you
are
the
reserved
force
we
would
rather
be
in
the
vanguard
i
need
you
to
insure
success
at
the
close
of
the
engagement
that
is
why
i
keep
you
back
there
is
too
much
of
this
keeping
back
it
is
all
the
same
you
are
in
the
column
you
march
in
the
rear
paris
has
a
right
to
march
at
the
head
i
will
consider
the
matter
sergeant
radoub
consider
it
commander
the
occasion
is
at
hand
hard
knocks
will
be
given
on
both
sides
it
will
be
lively
work
he
who
lays
a
finger
on
the
tourgue
will
get
himself
burned
we
request
the
favor
of
being
in
the
thick
of
it
the
sergeant
paused
twisted
his
moustache
and
continued
in
a
changed
voice
and
then
you
know
commander
our
little
ones
are
in
this
tower
our
children
are
there
the
children
of
the
battalion
our
three
children
that
abominable
wretch
called
the
imânus
that
that
thundering
devil
of
a
man
threatens
our
children
our
children
our
puppets
commander
no
harm
must
come
to
them
whatever
convulsion
shakes
the
tourgue
do
you
understand
that
commander
we
will
not
endure
it
just
now
i
took
advantage
of
the
truce
and
climbing
up
the
plateau
i
looked
at
them
through
the
window
yes
they
are
certainly
there
you
can
see
them
from
the
edge
of
the
ravine
i
saw
them
and
frightened
the
darlings
commander
if
a
single
hair
falls
from
the
heads
of
those
little
cherubs
i
swear
it
by
the
thousand
names
of
all
that
is
sacred
i
sergeant
radoub
will
demand
an
account
of
god
almighty
and
this
is
what
the
battalion
says
we
want
the
babies
to
be
saved
or
else
we
all
want
to
be
killed
we
have
a
right
to
ask
it
yes
that
every
man
of
us
be
killed
and
now
i
salute
you
and
present
my
respects
gauvain
held
out
his
hand
to
radoub
as
he
exclaimed
you
are
brave
fellows
you
will
join
the
attacking
column
i
shall
divide
you
into
two
parties
six
of
you
i
shall
place
in
the
vanguard
to
insure
the
advance
and
six
in
the
to
prevent
a
retreat
and
am
i
still
to
command
the
twelve
of
course
thank
you
commander
in
that
case
i
join
the
vanguard
radoub
made
the
military
salute
and
returned
to
the
ranks
gauvain
drew
out
his
watch
whispered
a
few
words
to
guéchamp
and
the
attacking
column
began
to
form
viii
the
speech
and
the
roar
illustration
meanwhile
cimourdain
who
had
not
yet
taken
his
position
on
the
plateau
and
who
stood
beside
gauvain
approached
a
trumpeter
sound
the
trumpet
he
said
to
him
the
clarion
sounded
the
horn
replied
again
the
clarion
and
the
trumpet
exchanged
calls
what
does
that
mean
asked
gauvain
of
guéchamp
what
does
cimourdain
want
cimourdain
with
a
white
handkerchief
in
his
hand
approached
the
tower
and
as
he
drew
near
he
cried
aloud
you
men
in
the
tower
do
you
know
me
and
the
voice
of
the
imânus
made
answer
from
the
heights
we
do
these
two
voices
were
now
heard
exchanging
question
and
reply
as
follows
i
am
the
ambassador
of
the
republic
you
are
the
former
curé
of
parigné
i
am
a
delegate
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
you
are
a
priest
i
am
a
representative
of
the
law
you
are
a
renegade
i
am
a
commissioner
of
the
revolution
you
are
an
apostate
i
am
cimourdain
you
are
a
demon
do
you
know
me
we
abominate
you
would
you
like
to
have
me
in
your
power
there
are
eighteen
of
us
here
who
would
give
our
heads
to
have
yours
well
then
i
have
come
to
give
myself
up
to
you
a
burst
of
savage
laughter
rang
out
from
the
top
of
the
tower
with
the
derisive
cry
come
a
deep
silence
of
expectancy
reigned
in
the
camp
cimourdain
continued
on
one
condition
what
is
that
listen
speak
you
hate
me
yes
and
i
love
you
i
am
your
brother
the
voice
from
above
replied
yes
our
brother
cain
cimourdain
went
on
with
a
peculiar
inflection
of
voice
soft
but
penetrating
insult
me
if
you
will
but
listen
to
my
words
i
come
here
protected
by
a
flag
of
truce
poor
misguided
men
you
are
in
very
truth
my
brothers
and
i
am
your
friend
i
am
the
light
trying
to
illumine
your
ignorance
light
is
the
essence
of
brotherhood
moreover
have
we
not
all
one
common
mother
our
native
land
then
listen
to
me
sooner
or
later
you
or
at
least
your
children
or
grandchildren
will
know
that
every
event
of
this
present
time
is
the
result
of
the
higher
law
and
that
this
revolution
is
the
work
of
god
himself
but
while
we
wait
for
the
time
when
to
the
inner
sense
of
every
man
even
unto
yours
all
these
things
will
be
made
plain
and
when
all
fanaticisms
including
our
own
will
vanish
before
the
powerful
light
that
is
to
dawn
is
there
none
to
take
pity
on
your
ignorance
behold
i
come
to
you
and
i
offer
you
my
head
more
than
this
i
hold
out
my
hand
i
beg
of
you
to
take
my
life
and
spare
your
own
all
power
is
vested
in
me
and
what
i
promise
i
can
fulfil
i
make
one
final
effort
in
this
decisive
moment
he
who
speaks
to
you
is
both
citizen
and
priest
the
citizen
contends
with
you
but
the
priest
implores
you
i
beseech
you
to
hear
me
many
among
you
have
wives
and
children
it
is
in
their
behalf
that
i
entreat
you
oh
my
brothers
go
on
with
your
preaching
sneered
the
imânus
cimourdain
continued
my
brethren
avert
this
fatal
hour
there
will
be
frightful
slaughter
here
many
of
us
who
stand
before
you
will
not
see
sun
yes
many
indeed
will
perish
and
you
you
will
all
die
have
mercy
on
yourselves
why
shed
all
this
blood
to
no
avail
why
kill
so
many
men
when
two
would
suffice
two
asked
the
imânus
yes
two
who
are
they
lantenac
and
myself
here
cimourdain
raised
his
voice
we
are
the
two
men
whose
deaths
would
be
most
pleasing
to
our
respective
parties
this
is
my
offer
accept
it
and
you
are
saved
give
lantenac
to
us
and
take
me
in
his
place
he
will
be
guillotined
and
with
me
you
may
do
what
you
will
priest
howled
the
imânus
if
we
but
had
you
we
would
roast
you
over
a
slow
fire
so
be
it
said
cimourdain
and
he
went
on
illustration
you
the
condemned
who
are
in
this
tower
in
one
hour
may
all
be
safe
and
free
i
offer
you
salvation
will
you
accept
the
imânus
burst
out
you
are
a
fool
as
well
as
a
villain
why
do
you
interfere
with
us
who
invited
you
to
come
here
with
your
speeches
you
expect
us
to
deliver
up
monseigneur
do
you
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
him
i
want
his
head
and
i
offer
you
your
skin
for
we
would
flay
you
like
a
dog
curé
but
no
your
skin
is
not
worth
his
head
begone
the
slaughter
will
be
terrible
once
more
i
beseech
you
to
reflect
night
had
come
on
during
the
progress
of
this
gloomy
conference
which
had
been
heard
both
within
and
without
the
tower
the
marquis
de
lantenac
listened
in
silence
letting
the
affair
take
its
course
leaders
sometimes
exhibit
this
indifference
as
a
kind
of
prerogative
of
responsibility
the
imânus
raised
his
voice
above
that
of
cimourdain
exclaiming
you
men
who
are
about
to
attack
us
we
have
declared
our
intentions
you
have
heard
our
offers
we
shall
make
no
change
in
them
and
woe
be
unto
you
if
you
refuse
them
but
if
you
consent
we
will
give
you
back
the
three
children
whom
we
now
hold
on
condition
that
each
one
of
us
is
allowed
to
depart
in
safety
you
may
all
go
free
save
one
replied
cimourdain
who
is
that
lantenac
monseigneur
deliver
monseigneur
never
we
must
have
lantenac
never
we
can
treat
with
you
on
no
other
condition
then
you
had
better
begin
the
attack
silence
ensued
the
imânus
having
given
the
signal
on
his
horn
came
down
the
marquis
grasped
his
sword
the
nineteen
besieged
silently
gathered
in
the
lower
hall
behind
the
and
fell
upon
their
knees
they
heard
the
measured
tread
of
the
attacking
column
as
it
advanced
towards
the
tower
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
in
the
darkness
until
suddenly
the
sound
was
close
upon
them
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
breach
then
every
man
knelt
and
adjusted
his
musket
or
blunderbuss
in
an
opening
of
the
retirade
while
one
of
their
number
the
former
priest
turmeau
rose
and
holding
in
his
right
hand
a
drawn
sabre
and
in
his
left
a
crucifix
solemnly
uttered
the
blessing
in
the
name
of
the
father
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
all
fired
at
once
and
the
conflict
began
illustration
illustration
ix
titans
against
giants
illustration
it
was
indeed
a
fearful
scene
this
struggle
surpassed
all
conception
to
find
its
parallel
one
must
have
recourse
to
the
great
duels
of
æschylus
or
to
the
butcheries
of
old
feudal
times
to
those
attacks
with
short
arms
that
continued
in
vogue
until
the
seventeenth
century
when
men
penetrated
into
fortified
places
by
way
of
concealed
breaches
tragic
assaults
where
says
an
old
sergeant
of
the
province
of
alentejo
the
mines
having
done
their
work
the
besiegers
will
now
advance
carrying
boards
covered
with
sheets
of
tin
armed
with
round
shields
and
bucklers
and
supplied
with
an
abundance
of
grenades
and
as
they
force
those
who
hold
the
intrenchments
and
to
give
way
they
will
take
possession
of
them
vigorously
expelling
the
besieged
the
scene
of
the
attack
was
terrible
it
was
one
of
those
breaches
technically
termed
a
covered
breach
and
was
it
must
be
remembered
not
a
wide
breach
opened
to
daylight
but
a
mere
crack
traversing
the
wall
from
side
to
side
the
powder
had
worked
like
an
auger
the
effect
of
the
explosion
had
been
so
tremendous
that
the
tower
was
cracked
for
more
than
forty
feet
above
the
chamber
of
the
mine
but
it
was
only
a
fissure
and
the
practicable
rent
that
served
as
a
breach
and
afforded
an
entrance
into
the
lower
hall
had
the
effect
of
having
been
pierced
by
the
thrust
of
a
lance
rather
than
cleft
by
a
blow
from
an
axe
it
was
a
puncture
in
the
side
of
the
tower
a
long
deep
cut
not
unlike
a
well
horizontal
with
the
ground
a
narrow
passage
twisting
and
turning
like
an
intestine
through
a
wall
fifteen
feet
thick
a
shapeless
cylinder
abounding
in
obstacles
pitfalls
and
all
the
débris
of
past
explosions
where
a
man
blinded
by
the
darkness
and
stumbling
over
the
rubbish
beneath
his
feet
would
surely
dash
his
head
against
the
granite
rock
before
the
assailants
yawned
this
black
portal
like
a
cavernous
mouth
whose
upper
and
lower
jaws
closely
set
with
jagged
rocks
rivalled
a
shark
mouth
in
the
number
of
its
teeth
this
cavity
was
the
only
means
of
entrance
or
exit
and
while
the
was
raining
within
on
the
other
side
that
is
to
say
in
the
lower
hall
of
the
rose
the
the
ferocity
of
the
encounter
can
only
be
compared
with
the
encounters
of
sappers
in
underground
passages
when
a
has
just
cut
across
a
mine
or
with
the
cutlass
butcheries
that
take
place
when
in
a
naval
battle
a
is
boarded
fighting
in
the
depths
of
a
grave
reaches
the
very
climax
of
all
that
is
dreadful
the
fact
that
a
ceiling
is
overhead
seems
to
increase
the
horror
of
human
slaughter
just
as
the
first
of
the
assailants
came
surging
in
the
was
wrapped
in
a
sheet
of
lightning
and
it
seemed
like
the
bursting
of
a
subterranean
report
answering
report
as
the
besiegers
returned
the
thunder
of
the
ambuscade
above
the
uproar
rose
the
voice
of
gauvain
shouting
break
them
in
then
lantenac
cry
stand
firm
against
the
enemy
then
the
cry
of
the
imânus
stand
by
me
men
of
maine
then
the
clang
of
sabres
clashing
one
against
the
other
and
terrible
discharges
following
in
swift
succession
dealing
death
on
every
hand
the
torch
fastened
to
the
wall
but
dimly
lighted
this
scene
of
horror
a
lurid
glare
enveloped
all
objects
amid
which
nothing
could
be
clearly
distinguished
and
those
who
entered
were
straightway
struck
deaf
and
blind
deafened
by
the
uproar
blinded
by
the
smoke
the
disabled
lay
here
and
there
among
the
rubbish
while
the
combatants
trampled
upon
the
corpses
crushing
the
wounds
and
bruising
the
broken
limbs
of
the
injured
men
who
groaned
aloud
in
their
wild
agony
and
sometimes
set
their
teeth
in
the
feet
of
those
who
were
torturing
them
now
and
then
a
silence
more
appalling
than
sound
would
settle
over
all
men
seized
each
other
by
the
throat
and
then
were
heard
fierce
pantings
followed
by
gnashings
of
teeth
and
imprecations
and
directly
all
the
din
returned
again
a
stream
of
blood
flowed
through
the
breach
in
the
tower
and
spreading
in
the
gloom
formed
a
dark
smoking
pool
outside
upon
the
grass
illustration
one
might
have
said
that
the
tower
herself
was
bleeding
like
a
wounded
giantess
surprising
to
relate
all
this
tumult
was
hardly
audible
on
the
outside
the
night
was
very
dark
and
around
the
besieged
fortress
an
almost
funereal
sense
of
peace
rested
on
forest
and
plain
hell
was
within
a
sepulchre
without
this
struggle
in
the
darkness
these
volleys
of
musketry
this
clamor
and
fury
all
this
tumult
and
confusion
was
subdued
by
the
massive
walls
and
arches
there
was
not
air
enough
for
reverberation
and
a
sense
of
suffocation
was
added
to
the
carnage
outside
the
tower
the
noise
was
scarcely
audible
and
meanwhile
the
three
little
children
still
slumbered
the
fury
of
the
combat
deepened
the
held
its
own
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
to
force
than
this
kind
of
barricade
with
a
angle
if
the
besieged
were
at
a
disadvantage
in
numbers
their
position
was
in
their
favor
the
attacking
column
had
suffered
serious
loss
of
men
formed
in
a
long
line
outside
the
tower
it
gradually
worked
its
way
through
the
breach
shortening
as
it
disappeared
like
a
snake
twisting
itself
into
its
hole
gauvain
with
the
rashness
peculiar

a
youthful
leader

in
the
lower
hall
in
the
thickest
of
the
mêlée
with
the
bullets
flying
in
all
directions
let
us
add
however
that
he
felt
all
the
confidence
of
a
man
who
had
never
been
wounded
as
he
turned
to
give
an
order
the
flash
from
a
volley
of
musketry
lighted
up
a
face
close
beside
him
cimourdain
why
are
you
here
i
came
to
be
near
you
replied
the
man
who
was
indeed
cimourdain
but
you
will
be
killed
what
of
that
are
you
not
in
the
same
danger
but
i
am
needed
here
and
you
are
not
since
you
are
here
my
place
is
by
your
side
no
my
master
yes
my
child
and
cimourdain
remained
near
gauvain
the
dead
lay
in
heaps
on
the
pavement
of
the
lower
hall
although
the
had
not
as
yet
been
carried
the
majority
would
sooner
or
later
gain
the
day
the
assailants
it
is
true
were
not
protected
while
the
assailed
were
under
cover
and
ten
of
the
besiegers
fell
to
one
of
the
besieged
but
the
latter
were
constantly
replaced
in
proportion
as
the
besieged
diminished
the
besiegers
increased
the
nineteen
besieged
were
collected
behind
the
since
that
was
the
centre
of
attack
and
among
them
were
their
dead
and
wounded
not
more
than
fifteen
of
them
were
in
fighting
condition
one
of
the
fiercest
had
been
mutilated
he
was
a
breton
with
curling
hair
and
short
of
stature
but
full
of
life
and
energy
although
his
jaw
was
broken
and
one
of
his
eyes
blown
out
he
could
still
walk
and
he
dragged
himself
up
the
winding
staircase
into
the
room
on
the
first
story
hoping
there
to
be
able
to
say
his
prayers
and
die
he
leaned
against
the
wall
near
the
trying
to
get
a
breath
of
air
the
butchery
down
below
in
front
of
the
had
grown
more
and
more
horrible
once
when
there
was
a
pause
between
two
volleys
cimourdain
raised
his
voice
besieged
he
cried
why
continue
this
bloodshed
you
are
conquered
surrender
remember
we
are
four
thousand
five
hundred
against
nineteen
which
is
over
two
hundred
to
one
surrender
let
us
put
an
end
to
that
idle
babble
replied
the
marquis
de
lantenac
and
twenty
balls
responded
to
cimourdain
appeal
the
did
not
reach
as
high
as
the
vaulted
ceiling
thus
the
besieged
were
enabled
to
fire
over
it
but
at
the
same
time
it
presented
to
the
besiegers
an
opportunity
for
an
escalade
an
assault
on
the
cried
gauvain
is
there
a
man
among
you
who
will
volunteer
to
scale
it
i
replied
sergeant
radoub
radoub
a
sudden
stupor
fell
upon
the
assailants
radoub
had
been
the
sixth
to
enter
the
breach
at
the
head
of
the
attacking
column
and
of
these
six
men
of
the
parisian
battalion
four
had
already
fallen
after
uttering
the
exclamation
i
he
was
seen
to
draw
back
instead
of
advancing
and
bending
over
in
a
crouching
attitude
he
crawled
between
the
legs
of
the
combatants
until
reaching
the
opening
of
the
breach
he
rushed
out
was
this
flight
was
it
possible
for
such
a
man
to
flee
what
could
it
mean
having
escaped
from
the
breach
radoub
still
blinded
by
the
smoke
rubbed
his
eyes
as
though
to
dispel
the
horror
and
gloom
of
the
night
and
by
the
faint
glimmer
of
the
stars
began
to
scrutinize
the
wall
of
the
tower
he
nodded
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
as
much
as
to
say
so
i
was
not
mistaken
radoub
had
noticed
that
the
deep
fissure
caused
by
the
explosion
of
the
mine
extended
from
the
breach
to
that
on
the
first
story
whose
iron
grating
had
been
shattered
and
partially
torn
off
by
a
and
thus
hanging
the
network
of
broken
bars
left
just
room
enough
for
a
man
to
pass
through
provided
he
could
climb
up
to
it
and
that
was
the
question
possibly
it
might
be
done
by
following
the
crack
supposing
the
man
to
be
a
cat
and
radoub
was
precisely
like
a
cat
he
was
of
the
race
which
pindar
calls
the
agile
athletes
although
a
man
may
be
an
old
soldier
it
by
no
means
follows
that
he
is
no
longer
young
radoub
who
had
been
in
the
french
guards
was
not
yet
forty
years
of
age
and
he
was
as
active
as
hercules
laying
his
musket
on
the
ground
he
removed
his
threw
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
keeping
only
his
two
pistols
which
he
stuck
in
the
belt
of
his
trousers
and
his
drawn
sabre
which
he
held
between
his
teeth
the
butts
of
his
pistols
projected
from
above
his
belt
thus
burdened
by
no
unnecessary
weight
and
followed
in
the
darkness
by
the
eyes
of
all
those
of
the
attacking
column
who
had
not
as
yet
entered
the
breach
he
began
the
ascent
climbing
the
stones
of
the
cracked
wall
as
though
they
had
been
the
steps
of
a
staircase
it
was
an
advantage
to
him
that
he
wore
no
shoes
there
is
nothing
like
a
naked
foot
for
clinging
and
he
twisted
his
toes
into
the
holes
between
the
stones
while
hoisting
himself
by
means
of
his
fists
he
used
his
knees
for
support
it
was
a
hard
pull
not
unlike
climbing
up
the
teeth
of
a
saw
luckily
he
thought
to
himself
there
is
no
one
in
the
room
on
the
first
story
for
if
there
were
i
should
never
have
been
allowed
to
climb
up
in
this
way
he
had
about
forty
feet
to
climb
after
this
fashion
and
as
he
advanced
somewhat
inconvenienced
by
the
projecting
butts
of
his
pistols
the
crack
grew
narrower
and
the
ascent
more
and
more
difficult
the
increasing
depth
of
the
precipice
beneath
his
feet
added
constantly
to
the
danger
of
a
fall
but
at
last
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
and
on
pushing
aside
the
twisted
and
broken
grating
he
found
that
he
had
ample
room
to
pass
through
then
raising
himself
by
a
powerful
effort
he
braced
his
knees
against
the
cornices
of
the
ledge
caught
hold
of
a
fragment
of
the
grating
on
either
hand
and
holding
his
sabre
between
his
teeth
he
drew
himself
up
as
high
as
his
waist
in
front
of
the
embrasure
of
the
there
with
his
entire
weight
resting
on
his
two
fists
he
hung
suspended
over
the
abyss
now
with
a
single
bound
he
had
but
to
leap
into
the
hall
of
the
first
story
suddenly
he
beheld
in
the
gloom
a
horrible
object
a
face
appeared
in
the
embrasure
like
a
bleeding
mask
with
its
jaw
crushed
and
one
eye
torn
out
and
this
mask
was
gazing
steadily
at
him
the
two
hands
belonging
to
this
mask
were
seen
to
reach
forth
from
the
darkness
in
the
direction
of
radoub
one
of
them
instantly
caught
the
pistols
from
his
belt
and
the
other
pulled
the
sabre
from
his
teeth
and
thus
radoub
was
disarmed
he
felt
his
knee
slipping
from
the
sloping
cornice
the
grasp
of
his
hands
on
fragments
of
the
grating
barely
sufficed
to
support
him
while
behind
him
yawned
an
abyss
of
forty
feet
illustration
that
mask
and
those
hands
belonged
to
suffocated
by
the
smoke
that
rose
from
below
had
made
his
way
into
the
embrasure
of
this
where
the
air
had
revived
him
the
freshness
of
the
night
had
checked
the
bleeding
of
his
wounds
and
he
had
begun
to
feel
somewhat
stronger
when
suddenly
in
the
opening
before
him
appeared
the
form
of
radoub
then
while
the
latter
hung
there
clinging
with
both
hands
to
the
railing
with
no
choice
but
to
drop
or
suffer
himself
to
be
disarmed
with
an
awful
calmness
snatched
the
two
pistols
from
big
belt
and
the
sabre
from
his
teeth
whereupon
ensued
a
duel
between
the
unarmed
and
the
wounded
a
duel
without
a
parallel
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
dying
man
would
come
off
victorious
one
shot
would
be
enough
to
hurl
radoub
into
the
yawning
gulf
below
luckily
for
radoub
in
consequence
of
holding
the
two
pistols
in
one
hand
was
unable
to
fire
either
and
was
forced
to
use
the
sabre
with
which
he
gave
radoub
a
thrust
in
the
shoulder
a
blow
which
wounded
him
and
at
the
same
time
saved
his
life
although
unarmed
radoub
in
full
possession
of
his
strength
and
heedless
of
his
injury
which
was
simply
a
suddenly
swung
himself
forward
and
releasing
his
hold
on
the
bars
leaped
into
the
embrasure
where
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
who
had
thrown
the
sabre
behind
him
as
he
knelt
clutching
a
pistol
in
either
hand
as
he
took
aim
at
radoub
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
was
so
close
as
nearly
to
touch
him
but
his
enfeebled
arm
trembled
and
a
minute
passed
before
he
could
fire
radoub
availed
himself
of
this
respite
to
burst
out
laughing
look
here
you
hideous
object
he
cried
do
you
think
you
can
frighten
me
with
your
jaw
like
beef
la
mode
sapristi
how
they
have
spoiled
your
face
for
you
was
aiming
at
him
i
suppose
it
is
rather
rude
to
say
so
continued
radoub
but
the
has
made
a
pretty
ragged
piece
of
work
of
your
head
bellona
spoiled
your
beauty
my
poor
fellow
come
come
spit
out
your
little
my
friend
the
pistol
went
off
and
the
ball
grazing
radoub
head
tore
away
half
his
ear
still
grasping
the
second
pistol
raised
his
other
arm
but
radoub
gave
him
no
time
to
take
aim
it
quite
enough
to
lose
one
ear
he
cried
you
have
wounded
me
twice
and
now
my
turn
has
come
throwing
himself
on
he
gave
his
arm
so
powerful
a
blow
that
the
pistol
went
off
in
the
air
then
seizing
him
by
his
wounded
jaw
he
twisted
it
until
uttered
a
howl
of
agony
and
fainted
radoub
stepped
over
his
prostrate
form
and
left
him
lying
in
the
embrasure
now
that
i
have
made
known
to
you
my
ultimatum
do
you
dare
to
stir
he
said
lie
there
base
reptile
that
you
are
you
may
be
very
sure
that
i
shall
not
amuse
myself
at
present
by
killing
you
crawl
at
your
leisure
over
the
ground
under
my
feet
you
will
have
to
die
anyhow
and
then
you
will
find
out
what
nonsense
your
curé
has
been
telling
you
away
with
you
into
the
great
mystery
peasant
and
he
sprang
into
the
hall
of
the
lower
story
one
ca
see
his
hand
before
him
he
grumbled
was
convulsively
writhing
and
moaning
in
his
agony
radoub
looked
back
silence
will
you
please
to
keep
still
citizen
without
knowing
it
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
for
i
should
scorn
to
put
an
end
to
your
life
now
leave
me
in
peace
and
as
he
stood
watching
he
plunged
his
hands
restlessly
into
his
hair
what
am
i
to
do
this
is
all
very
well
but
here
i
am
disarmed
i
had
two
shots
to
fire
and
you
have
wasted
them
animal
that
you
are
and
besides
the
smoke
is
so
thick
that
it
makes
my
eyes
water
and
accidentally
touching
his
tom
ear
he
cried
out
with
pain
you
have
not
gained
much
by
getting
my
ear
he
continued
in
fact
i
would
rather
lose
that
than
any
other
member
it
only
an
ornament
any
way
you
have
scratched
my
shoulder
too
but
that
of
no
consequence
you
may
die
in
peace
rustic
i
forgive
you
he
listened
the
noise
in
the
lower
hall
was
frightful
the
fight
was
raging
more
wildly
than
ever
things
are
progressing
downstairs
hear
them
yelling
live
the
king
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
they
die
nobly
he
stumbled
over
his
sabre
that
lay
on
the
floor
and
as
he
picked
it
up
he
said
to
who
had
ceased
to
moan
and
who
might
very
possibly
be
dead
you
see
man
of
the
woods
my
sabre
is
not
of
the
slightest
use
for
what
i
intended
to
do
however
i
take
it
as
a
keepsake
from
you
but
i
needed
my
pistols
devil
take
you
savage
what
am
i
to
do
here
i
am
of
no
use
at
all
as
he
advanced
into
the
hall
tiding
to
see
where
he
was
and
to
get
his
bearings
he
suddenly
discovered
in
the
shadow
behind
the
central
pillar
a
long
table
and
upon
this
table
something
faintly
gleaming
he
felt
of
the
objects
they
were
muskets
pistols
and
carbines
a
whole
row
of
arranged
in
order
and
apparently
only
waiting
for
hands
to
seize
them
this
was
the
reserve
prepared
by
the
besieged
for
the
second
stage
of
the
assault
indeed
it
was
a
complete
arsenal
this
is
a
treasure
indeed
exclaimed
radoub
and
half
dazed
with
joy
he
flung
himself
upon
them
illustration
then
it
was
that
he
became
formidable
near
the
table
covered
with
could
be
seen
the
door
of
the
staircase
leading
to
the
upper
and
lower
stories
radoub
dropped
his
sabre
seized
a
pistol
in
each
hand
and
instantly
fired
at
random
through
the
door
leading
to
the
spiral
staircase
then
he
grasped
a
blunderbuss
firing
that
also
and
directly
afterwards
a
gun
loaded
with
buckshot
whose
fifteen
balls
made
as
much
noise
as
a
volley
of
after
which
pausing
to
take
breath
he
shouted
in
thundering
tones
down
the
staircase
long
live
paris
seizing
another
blunderbuss
bigger
than
the
first
he
aimed
it
towards
the
vault
of
the
winding
staircase
and
paused
again
the
uproar
that
ensued
in
the
lower
hall
baffles
description
resistance
is
shattered
by
such
unlooked
for
surprises
two
of
the
balls
of
radoub
triple
discharge
had
taken
effect
killing
the
older
of
the
brothers
and
houzard
who
was
de
quélen
they
are
upstairs
cried
the
marquis
at
this
exclamation
the
men
determined
to
abandon
the
and
no
flock
of
birds
could
have
surpassed
the
rapidity
of
their
flight
as
they
rushed
towards
the
staircase
the
marquis
urging
them
onward
make
haste
he
cried
now
we
must
show
our
courage
by
flight
let
us
all
go
up
to
the
second
floor
and
there
begin
anew
he
himself
was
the
last
man
to
leave
the
and
to
this
act
of
bravery
he
owed
his
life
radoub
with
his
finger
on
the
trigger
was
concealed
on
the
first
landing
of
the
staircase
watching
the
rout
the
first
men
who
appeared
at
the
turn
of
the
staircase
received
the
discharge
full
in
their
faces
and
fell
and
if
the
marquis
had
been
among
them
he
would
have
been
a
dead
man
before
radoub
had
time
to
seize
another
weapon
they
had
all
passed
and
the
marquis
moving
more
deliberately
than
the
others
brought
up
the
rear
supposing
as
they
did
that
the
room
on
the
first
story
was
filled
with
the
besiegers
they
never
paused
until
they
reached
the
mirror
room
on
the
second
story
the
room
with
the
iron
door
and
the
sulphur
match
where
they
must
either
capitulate
or
die
gauvain
quite
as
much
surprised
as
any
one
of
the
besieged
at
the
sound
of
the
shots
from
the
staircase
and
having
no
idea
of
the
source
of
this
unexpected
assistance
but
availing
himself
of
it
without
trying
to
understand
had
leaped
over
the
followed
by
his
men
and
sword
in
hand
had
driven
the
fugitives
to
the
first
story
there
he
found
radoub
who
with
a
military
salute
said
to
him
one
moment
commander
it
was
i
who
did
that
i
had
not
forgotten
dol
so
i
followed
your
example
and
took
the
enemy
between
two
fires
you
are
a
clever
scholar
replied
gauvain
with
a
smile
one
eyes
like
those
of
night
birds
grow
accustomed
to
a
dim
light
after
a
certain
time
and
gauvain
discovered
that
radoub
was
covered
with
blood
but
you
are
wounded
comrade
oh
that
is
nothing
commander
what
is
an
ear
more
or
less
i
got
a
too
but
i
do
mind
it
when
one
breaks
a
pane
of
glass
of
course
one
gets
a
few
cuts
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
little
blood
in
the
room
in
the
first
story
conquered
by
radoub
the
men
halted
a
lantern
was
brought
and
cimourdain
rejoined
gauvain
whereupon
they
both
took
counsel
together
and
well
they
might
the
besiegers
were
not
in
the
confidence
of
the
besieged
they
had
no
means
of
knowing
their
scarcity
of
ammunition
nor
their
want
of
powder
the
second
story
was
their
very
last
intrenchment
and
the
assailants
thought
it
not
unlikely
that
the
staircase
might
be
mined
one
thing
was
certain
the
enemy
could
not
escape
those
who
were
not
killed
were
like
men
locked
in
a
prison
lantenac
was
caught
in
the
trap
resting
upon
this
assurance
they
felt
that
it
would
be
well
to
devote
a
short
time
to
considering
the
matter
of
bringing
the
affair
to
a
crisis
many
of
their
men
had
already
been
killed
they
must
take
measures
to
prevent
too
great
a
loss
of
life
in
the
final
assault
there
would
be
serious
danger
in
this
last
attack
at
the
first
onset
they
would
no
doubt
find
themselves
exposed
to
a
heavy
fire
hostilities
had
ceased
the
besiegers
in
possession
of
the
and
the
first
story
waited
for
orders
from
their
chief
to
renew
the
fight
while
gauvain
and
cimourdain
held
counsel
together
radoub
listened
in
silence
to
their
deliberations
at
last
he
timidly
ventured
another
military
salute
commander
what
is
it
radoub
have
i
earned
a
small
reward
certainly
ask
what
you
will
then
i
ask
to
be
the
first
one
to
go
up
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
him
besides
he
would
have
gone
without
permission
xi
the
desperate
while
these
deliberations
were
in
progress
on
the
first
floor
a
barricade
was
going
up
overhead
if
success
inspires
fury
defeat
fills
men
with
rage
the
two
stories
were
about
to
clash
in
wild
frenzy
there
is
a
sense
of
intoxication
in
the
assurance
of
victory
the
assailants
below
were
buoyed
up
by
hope
that
most
powerful
incentive
to
human
effort
when
it
is
not
counteracted
by
despair
all
the
despair
was
above
calm
cold
and
gloomy
despair
when
they
reached
this
hall
of
refuge
their
last
resource
they
proceeded
first
of
all
to
bar
the
entrance
and
in
order
to
accomplish
this
object
they
decided
that
the
blockading
of
the
staircase
would
be
more
effectual
than
barring
the
door
under
such
circumstances
an
obstacle
through
which
one
can
both
see
what
is
going
on
and
fight
at
the
same
time
is
a
better
defence
than
a
closed
door
all
the
light
they
had
came
from
the
torch
which
imânus
had
stuck
in
the
holder
on
the
wall
near
the
sulphur
match
one
of
those
great
heavy
oaken
chests
such
as
formerly
served
the
purpose
of
holding
clothing
and
linen
before
the
invention
of
chests
of
drawers
stood
in
the
hall
and
this
trunk
they
dragged
out
and
set
up
on
end
in
the
doorway
of
the
staircase
it
fitted
so
closely
into
the
space
that
it
blocked
up
the
entrance
leaving
just
room
enough
for
the
passage
of
a
single
man
thus
affording
them
an
excellent
chance
to
kill
their
assailants
one
by
one
it
seemed
somewhat
doubtful
whether
any
of
them
would
attempt
to
enter
meanwhile
the
obstructed
entrance
gave
them
a
respite
during
which
they
counted
the
men
of
the
original
nineteen
but
seven
remained
including
the
imânus
and
he
and
the
marquis
were
the
only
ones
who
had
not
been
wounded
the
five
wounded
men
who
were
still
active
for
in
the
excitement
of
battle
no
man
would
succumb
to
anything
less
than
a
mortal
wound
were
chatenay
called
robi
guinoiseau
hoisnard
and
all
the
others
were
dead
their
ammunition
was
exhausted
and
their
were
empty
on
counting
the
cartridges
they
found
that
there
were
just
four
rounds
apiece
among
the
seven
men
death
was
now
their
only
resource
behind
them
yawned
the
dreadful
precipice
they
could
hardly
have
been
nearer
to
the
edge
meanwhile
the
attack
had
just
begun
again
slowly
it
is
true
but
none
the
less
determined
as
the
assailants
advanced
they
could
hear
the
of
their
muskets
strike
on
each
stair
by
way
of
testing
its
security
all
means
of
escape
were
cut
off
by
way
of
the
library
six
guns
stood
on
the
plateau
with
matches
lighted
through
the
rooms
overhead
to
what
avail
opening
on
to
the
platform
as
they
did
they
simply
offered
an
opportunity
to
hurl
themselves
from
the
summit
of
the
tower
into
the
depths
below
and
now
the
seven
survivors
of
this
epic
band
realized
the
hopelessness
of
their
position
within
that
solid
wall
which
though
protecting
for
the
moment
would
in
the
end
betray
they
were
practically
prisoners
although
not
as
yet
really
captured
the
voice
of
the
marquis
broke
the
silence
my
friends
all
is
over
he
said
then
after
a
pause
he
added
will
for
the
time
being
resume
the
duties
of
the
abbé
turmeau
all
knelt
rosary
in
hand
the
sounds
of
the
of
the
besiegers
guns
came
nearer
and
nearer
bleeding
from
a
gunshot
wound
which
had
grazed
his
skull
and
torn
away
his
hairy
leathern
cap
raised
a
crucifix
in
his
right
hand
the
marquis
a
thorough
sceptic
knelt
on
one
knee
let
each
one
confess
his
sins
aloud
speak
monseigneur
and
the
marquis
replied
i
have
killed
my
and
i
the
same
said
hoisnard
and
i
said
guinoiseau
and
i
said
and
i
said
chatenay
and
i
said
the
imânus
then
repeated
in
the
name
of
the
most
holy
trinity
i
absolve
you
may
your
souls
depart
in
peace
amen
replied
all
the
voices
the
marquis
rose
now
let
us
die
he
said
and
kill
as
well
said
the
imânus
the
blows
from
the
of
the
muskets
already
shook
the
chest
that
stood
within
the
door
barring
the
entrance
turn
your
thoughts
to
god
said
the
priest
earth
no
longer
exists
for
you
yes
rejoined
the
marquis
we
are
in
the
tomb
all
bowed
their
heads
and
smote
their
breasts
the
priest
and
the
marquis
alone
remained
standing
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
the
priest
and
the
peasants
absorbed
in
prayer
the
marquis
buried
in
his
own
thoughts
the
chest
under
the
strokes
of
the
guns
sent
forth
its
dismal
reverberations
at
that
moment
a
powerful
resonant
voice
suddenly
rang
out
behind
them
exclaiming
i
told
you
so
monseigneur
all
the
heads
turned
in
amazement
a
hole
had
just
opened
in
the
wall
a
stone
fitting
perfectly
with
the
others
but
left
without
cement
and
provided
with
a
pivot
above
and
below
had
revolved
on
itself
like
a
turnstile
and
as
it
turned
had
opened
the
wall
in
revolving
on
its
axis
it
opened
a
double
passage
to
the
right
and
left
narrow
it
is
true
yet
wide
enough
to
allow
a
man
to
pass
and
through
this
unexpected
door
could
be
seen
the
first
steps
of
a
spiral
staircase
a
man
face
appeared
in
the
opening
and
the
marquis
recognized
halmalo
illustration
xii
the
deliverer
is
that
you
halmalo
it
is
i
monseigneur
you
see
i
was
right
about
the
turning
stones
and
that
there
is
a
way
of
escape
i
have
come
just
in
time
but
you
must
make
haste
ten
minutes
more
and
you
will
be
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
god
is
great
said
the
priest
save
yourself
monseigneur
cried
the
men
not
until
i
have
seen
every
one
of
you
in
safety
said
the
marquis
but
you
must
lead
the
way
monseigneur
said
the
abbé
turmeau
not
so
replied
the
marquis
i
shall
be
the
last
man
to
leave
and
in
a
severe
tone
he
continued
let
there
be
no
strife
in
this
matter
of
generosity
we
have
no
time
for
a
display
of
magnanimity
your
only
chance
for
life
is
in
escape
you
hear
my
commands
make
haste
now
and
take
advantage
of
this
outlet
for
which
i
thank
you
halmalo
are
we
then
to
separate
monsieur
le
marquis
asked
the
abbé
turmeau
certainly
after
we
have
left
the
tower
otherwise
there
would
be
small
chance
for
escape
will
monseigneur
appoint
some
place
of
yes
a
glade
in
the
forest
the
do
you
know
the
spot
we
all
know
it
all
those
who
are
able
to
walk
will
find
me
there
at
noonday
every
man
will
be
on
the
spot
and
then
we
will
begin
the
war
over
again
said
the
marquis
meanwhile
halmalo
bringing
all
his
strength
to
bear
on
the
turning
stone
found
that
it
would
not
stir
and
therefore
the
opening
could
not
be
closed
let
us
make
haste
monseigneur
he
cried
the
stone
will
not
move
i
managed
to
open
the
passage
but
now
i
can
not
close
it
in
fact
the
stone
from
a
long
disuse
had
stiffened
so
to
speak
in
its
groove
and
it
was
impossible
to
start
it
again
monseigneur
said
halmalo
i
hoped
to
close
the
passage
so
that
when
the
blues
came
in
and
found
no
one
here
they
would
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
and
might
imagine
that
you
had
all
vanished
in
smoke
but
the
stone
is
not
to
be
moved
and
the
enemy
will
find
the
outlet
and
probably
pursue
us
so
let
us
lose
not
a
minute
but
reach
the
staircase
as
quickly
as
we
can
the
imânus
laid
his
hand
on
halmalo
shoulder
comrade
he
said
how
long
will
it
take
to
go
through
this
passage
and
reach
the
woods
in
safety
are
any
of
the
men
seriously
wounded
asked
halmalo
none
they
answered
in
that
case
a
quarter
of
an
hour
will
be
sufficient
so
if
the
enemy
does
not
get
in
here
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
rejoined
the
imânus
he
might
pursue
but
he
could
not
overtake
us
but
they
will
be
upon
us
in
five
minutes
said
the
marquis
that
old
chest
can
not
keep
them
out
much
longer
a
few
blows
from
their
muskets
will
settle
the
affair
a
quarter
of
an
hour
who
could
hold
them
at
bay
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
said
the
imânus
you
yes
i
monseigneur
listen
out
of
six
men
five
of
us
are
wounded
i
have
not
even
a
scratch
nor
i
either
said
the
marquis
yes
but
you
are
the
chief
monseigneur
i
am
a
soldier
the
chief
and
the
soldier
are
two
different
persons
our
duties
are
not
alike
it
is
true
monseigneur
at
this
moment
we
have
but
one
duty
between
us
and
that
is
to
save
your
life
the
imânus
turned
to
his
companions
comrades
he
said
we
must
hold
the
enemy
in
check
and
delay
pursuit
until
the
last
moment
listen
i
have
not
lost
a
drop
of
blood
not
having
been
wounded
i
am
as
strong
as
ever
and
can
hold
out
longer
than
any
of
the
others
go
now
but
leave
me
your
weapons
and
i
promise
to
make
good
use
of
them
i
will
undertake
to
keep
the
enemy
at
bay
a
good
how
many
loaded
pistols
are
there
four
put
them
down
on
the
floor
they
did
as
he
required
that
is
well
i
remain
here
and
they
will
find
some
one
to
entertain
them
now
get
away
as
fast
as
you
can
in
moments
of
imminent
peril
gratitude
finds
but
brief
expression
hardly
had
they
time
to
press
his
hand
we
shall
soon
meet
again
said
the
marquis
i
hope
not
monseigneur
not
quite
at
once
for
i
am
about
to
die
one
by
one
they
made
their
way
down
the
narrow
staircase
the
wounded
in
advance
and
as
they
went
the
marquis
drew
a
pencil
from
his
and
wrote
a
few
words
on
the
stone
that
refusing
to
turn
had
thus
left
an
open
come
monseigneur
you
are
the
only
one
left
said
halmalo
as
he
went
down
the
marquis
followed
him
and
imânus
remained
alone
xiii
the
executioner
upon
the
flagstones
which
formed
the
only
floor
of
the
hall
the
four
pistols
had
been
placed
and
the
imânus
taking
two
of
them
one
in
each
hand
advanced
stealthily
towards
the
entrance
of
the
staircase
obstructed
and
concealed
by
the
chest
the
assailants
evidently
suspected
a
snare
they
might
be
on
the
verge
of
one
of
those
decisive
explosions
that
overwhelm
both
conquerer
and
conquered
in
one
common
ruin
in
proportion
as
the
first
attack
had
been
impetuous
the
last
was
cautious
and
deliberate
they
could
not
or
perhaps
did
not
care
to
batter
down
the
chest
by
main
force
they
had
destroyed
the
bottom
of
it
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
and
pierced
its
lid
with
their
bayonets
and
now
through
these
holes
they
attempted
to
see
the
interior
of
the
hall
before
venturing
within
it
the
glimmer
of
the
lanterns
by
means
of
which
the
staircase
was
lighted
fell
through
these
chinks
and
the
imânus
catching
sight
of
an
eye
peering
through
one
of
them
instantly
adjusted
the
barrel
of
his
pistol
to
the
spot
and
pulled
the
trigger
no
sooner
had
he
fired
than
to
his
great
joy
he
heard
a
terrible
cry
the
ball
passed
through
the
head
by
way
of
the
eye
and
the
soldier
interrupted
in
his
gazing
fell
backward
down
the
staircase
the
assailants
had
broken
open
the
lower
part
of
the
lid
in
two
places
forming
something
not
unlike
and
the
imânus
availing
himself
of
one
of
these
apertures
thrust
his
arm
in
it
and
fired
his
second
pistol
at
random
among
the
mass
of
the
besiegers
the
ball
probably
rebounded
for
several
cries
were
heard
as
though
three
or
four
had
been
killed
or
wounded
and
a
great
tumult
ensued
as
the
men
losing
their
footing
fell
back
in
confusion
the
imânus
threw
down
the
two
pistols
which
he
had
discharged
and
caught
up
the
remaining
ones
grasping
one
in
each
hand
he
peered
through
the
holes
in
the
chest
and
beheld
the
result
of
his
first
assault
the
besiegers
had
retreated
down
the
stairs
and
the
dying
lay
writhing
in
agony
upon
the
steps
the
form
of
the
spiral
staircase
prevented
him
from
seeing
beyond
three
or
four
steps
he
paused
so
much
time
gained
he
thought
to
himself
meanwhile
he
saw
a
man
crawling
up
the
steps
flat
on
his
stomach
and
just
at
that
moment
a
little
farther
down
the
head
of
a
soldier
emerged
from
behind
the
central
pillar
of
the
winding
stairs
the
imânus
aimed
at
this
head
and
fired
the
soldier
fell
back
with
a
cry
and
as
the
imânus
was
transferring
his
last
pistol
from
his
left
hand
into
his
right
he
himself
felt
a
horrible
pain
and
in
his
turn
uttered
a
yell
of
agony
some
tone
had
thrust
a
sabre
into
his
vitals
and
it
was
the
very
man
whom
he
had
seen
crawling
along
the
stair
whose
hand
entering
the
other
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
chest
had
plunged
a
sabre
into
the
body
of
the
imânus
the
wound
was
frightful
the
abdomen
was
pierced
through
and
through
the
imânus
did
not
fall
he
ground
his
teeth
as
he
muttered
that
is
good
then
tottering
and
with
great
effort
he
dragged
himself
back
to
the
torch
still
burning
near
the
iron
door
this
he
seized
after
putting
down
his
pistol
and
then
supporting
with
his
left
hand
the
protruding
intestines
with
his
right
he
lowered
the
torch
until
it
touched
the
which
caught
fire
and
the
wick
blazed
up
in
an
instant
dropping
the
still
burning
torch
upon
the
ground
he
grasped
his
pistol
and
although
he
had
fallen
on
the
flags
he
lifted
himself
and
used
the
scanty
breath
that
was
left
him
to
fan
the
flame
which
starting
ran
along
until
it
passed
under
the
iron
door
and
reached
the
when
he
beheld
the
triumph
of
his
villanous
scheme
taking
to
himself
more
credit
for
this
crime
than
for
his
the
man
who
had
acted
the
part
of
a
hero
and
who
now
degraded
himself
to
the
level
of
an
assassin
smiled
as
he
was
about
to
die
and
muttered
they
will
remember
me
i
take
vengeance
on
their
little
ones
in
behalf
of
our
own
little
king
shut
up
in
the
temple
illustration
xiv
the
imânus
also
escapes
illustration
at
that
moment
a
loud
voice
was
heard
and
the
chest
violently
hurled
aside
was
shattered
into
fragments
giving
passage
to
a
man
who
sabre
in
hand
rushed
into
the
hall
it
is
i
radoub
he
cried
who
wants
to
fight
me
i
am
bored
to
death
with
waiting
and
i
must
run
the
risk
i
do
care
what
happens
at
all
events
i
have
disembowelled
one
of
you
and
now
i
come
to
attack
you
all
follow
me
or
not
as
you
like
but
here
i
am
how
many
are
you
it
was
indeed
radoub
himself
and
he
alone
after
the
slaughter
that
the
imânus
had
made
on
the
staircase
gauvain
suspecting
some
hidden
mine
had
withdrawn
his
men
and
was
taking
counsel
with
cimourdain
amid
the
darkness
where
the
expiring
torch
cast
but
a
feeble
glimmer
radoub
sabre
in
hand
stood
on
the
threshold
and
repeated
his
question
i
am
alone
how
many
are
you
receiving
no
reply
he
advanced
just
then
one
of
those
sudden
flashes
emitted
from
time
to
time
by
a
dying
fire
a
kind
of
throbbing
light
which
might
be
compared
with
a
human
sob
burst
from
the
torch
and
illuminated
the
entire
hall
radoub
caught
sight
of
one
of
the
little
mirrors
hung
on
the
wall
and
approaching
it
inspected
his
bloody
face
and
lacerated
ear
saying
as
he
did
so
what
a
horrible
mutilation
then
he
turned
surprised
to
see
the
hall
empty
and
cried
no
one
here
not
a
soul
his
eyes
lighted
on
the
revolving
stone
the
passage
and
the
staircase
ah
i
understand
they
have
taken
to
their
heels
come
on
comrades
come
on
they
have
all
run
away
they
have
gone
evaporated
dissolved
vanished
there
was
a
crack
in
this
old
jug
of
a
tower
there
is
the
hole
through
which
they
got
out
the
rascals
how
are
we
ever
to
get
the
better
of
pitt
and
coburg
when
men
play
tricks
like
these
the
devil
himself
must
have
come
to
their
aid
there
is
no
one
here
a
was
fired
and
a
ball
grazing
his
elbow
flattened
itself
against
the
wall
ah
some
one
is
here
then
to
whom
do
i
owe
this
delicate
attention
to
me
replied
a
voice
radoub
peering
through
the
shadows
at
last
descried
the
form
of
imânus
aha
he
cried
i
have
got
one
of
you
the
others
have
escaped
but
you
will
not
get
off
is
that
your
opinion
replied
the
imânus
radoub
made
one
step
forward
and
paused
hey
i
who
are
you
lying
on
the
ground
there
i
am
a
man
on
the
ground
who
laughs
at
those
who
are
on
the
feet
what
is
that
in
your
right
hand
a
pistol
and
in
your
left
hand
my
intestines
i
take
you
prisoner
i
defy
you
to
do
it
and
the
imânus
stooping
over
the
burning
wick
blew
feebly
upon
its
flame
and
with
that
breath
expired
a
few
moments
later
gauvain
and
cimourdain
followed
by
the
others
entered
the
hall
they
all
saw
the
opening
and
after
searching
every
corner
and
exploring
the
staircase
which
led
down
into
the
ravine
they
felt
very
sure
that
the
enemy
had
escaped
they
shook
the
imânus
but
he
was
dead
gauvain
with
lantern
in
hand
examined
the
stone
which
had
furnished
the
fugitives
with
a
means
of
escape
he
had
heard
of
this
revolving
stone
but
he
too
had
always
regarded
it
as
a
fable
while
he
was
examining
the
stone
he
noticed
certain
words
written
with
a
pencil
and
holding
the
lantern
nearer
he
read
as
follows
au
revoir
monsieur
le
vicomte
lantenac
guéchamp
had
joined
gauvain
pursuit
was
manifestly
out
of
the
question
the
escape
had
been
successful
everything
was
in
favor
of
the
fugitives
the
entire
country
the
underbrush
the
ravines
the
copses
and
even
the
inhabitants
themselves
no
doubt
they
were
far
enough
away
by
this
time
there
was
no
possibility
of
finding
them
and
the
entire
forest
of
fougères
was
one
vast
what
was
to
be
done
they
saw
themselves
forced
to
begin
the
whole
affair
over
again
gauvain
and
guéchamp
exchanged
their
regrets
and
conjectures
cimourdain
listened
gravely
without
uttering
a
word
by
the
way
guéchamp
how
was
it
about
the
ladder
it
has
not
come
commander
but
we
saw
a
wagon
with
an
escort
of
gendarmes
it
was
not
bringing
the
ladder
replied
guéchamp
what
then
was
it
bringing
the
guillotine
said
cimourdain
xv
never
put
a
watch
and
key
in
the
same
pocket
the
marquis
de
lantenac
was
not
so
far
away
as
they
supposed
although
he
was
in
perfect
safety
and
beyond
their
reach
he
had
followed
halmalo
the
staircase
by
which
they
had
descended
following
the
other
fugitives
ended
in
a
narrow
passage
quite
near
the
ravine
and
the
arches
of
the
bridge
this
passage
led
into
a
deep
natural
fissure
in
the
ground
which
formed
a
connecting
link
between
the
ravine
and
the
forest
in
this
fissure
twisting
and
turning
as
it
did
through
impenetrable
thickets
and
utterly
hidden
from
the
human
eye
no
man
could
ever
have
been
captured
he
had
but
to
follow
the
example
of
a
snake
and
his
safety
was
assured
the
entrance
to
this
secret
passage
was
so
overgrown
with
brambles
that
its
constructors
had
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
provide
it
with
any
other
screen
the
marquis
had
now
no
further
need
even
to
consider
the
matter
of
disguise
since
his
arrival
in
brittany
he
had
continued
to
wear
the
peasant
dress
feeling
himself
to
be
more
truly
a
grand
seigneur
when
thus
attired
he
had
contented
himself
with
taking
off
his
sword
unfastening
and
throwing
aside
the
belt
when
halmalo
and
the
marquis
emerged
from
the
passage
into
the
fissure
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
the
five
others
guinoiseau
hoisnard
brin
chatenay
and
the
abbé
turmeau
they
have
lost
no
time
said
halmalo
follow
their
example
replied
the
marquis
does
monseigneur
wish
me
to
leave
him
of
course
i
have
told
you
so
already
a
man
who
is
trying
to
escape
must
remain
alone
if
he
would
insure
success
one
man
can
often
pass
where
two
would
find
it
impossible
were
we
together
we
should
attract
attention
and
imperil
each
other
does
monseigneur
know
the
neighborhood
yes
and
the
is
still
to
be
the
same
at
the
at
noon
i
will
be
there
we
shall
all
be
there
halmalo
paused
ah
monseigneur
when
i
remember
the
time
we
were
alone
together
on
the
open
sea
when
i
wanted
to
kill
you
you
who
were
my
lord
and
master
and
might
have
told
me
but
did
not
what
a
man
you
are
the
sole
reply
of
the
marquis
was
england
is
our
only
resource
in
fifteen
days
the
english
must
be
in
france
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
tell
monseigneur
i
have
given
all
his
messages
we
will
attend
to
all
that
farewell
till
then
monseigneur
by
the
way
are
you
hungry
perhaps
i
am
monseigneur
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
here
that
i
have
forgotten
whether
i
had
anything
to
eat
or
not
the
marquis
drew
from
his
pocket
a
cake
of
chocolate
broke
it
in
two
and
giving
one
half
to
halmalo
he
began
to
eat
the
other
himself
monseigneur
said
halmalo
you
will
find
the
ravine
on
your
right
and
the
forest
on
your
left
very
well
leave
me
now
go
your
own
way
halmalo
obeyed
and
was
at
once
lost
in
the
darkness
at
first
there
was
a
rustling
of
the
underbrush
soon
followed
by
silence
and
in
a
few
moments
every
trace
of
his
passage
had
disappeared
this
land
of
the
bocage
bristling
with
forests
and
labyrinths
was
the
best
ally
men
vanished
before
one
very
eyes
it
was
this
facility
for
rapid
disappearance
that
made
our
armies
pause
before
this
vendée
and
rendered
its
combatants
so
formidable
in
their
flight
illustration
the
marquis
stood
motionless
although
he
was
a
man
who
kept
his
feelings
under
perfect
control
he
was
not
insensible
to
the
joy
of
breathing
the
fresh
air
after
having
lived
so
long
in
an
atmosphere
of
blood
and
carnage
to
be
rescued
at
a
moment
when
all
seemed
utterly
lost
to
find
one
self
in
safety
after
gazing
into
one
own
grave
to
be
snatched
from
death
to
life
is
a
severe
shock
even
for
such
a
man
as
lantenac
and
although
this
was
by
no
means
his
only
experience
of
the
kind
he
could
not
at
once
subdue
his
agitation
for
a
moment
he
admitted
to
himself
his
own
satisfaction
but
straightway
suppressed
an
emotion
that
was
akin
to
joy
drawing
out
his
watch
he
struck
the
hour
he
wondered
what
time
it
might
be
and
to
his
great
surprise
discovered
that
it
was
but
ten
when
one
has
just
passed
through
some
terrible
crisis
wherein
life
and
death
have
hung
in
the
balance
it
is
always
astonishing
to
discover
that
those
minutes
so
crowded
with
action
were
no
longer
than
any
others
the
warning
cannon
had
been
fired
shortly
before
sunset
and
half
an
hour
later
just
at
dusk
between
seven
and
eight
the
assault
on
the
tourgue
began
hence
this
tremendous
combat
beginning
at
eight
and
ending
at
ten
this
epic
as
one
might
call
it
had
consumed
just
one
hundred
and
twenty
minutes
catastrophes
often
descend
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
events
are
marvellously
and
when
one
pauses
to
reflect
it
would
be
surprising
were
it
otherwise
two
hours
resistance
offered
by
so
small
a
band
against
a
force
vastly
superior
to
itself
was
extraordinary
and
this
struggle
of
nineteen
against
four
thousand
could
not
be
called
a
brief
one
but
it
was
time
to
go
halmalo
must
by
this
time
be
far
away
and
the
marquis
felt
that
prudence
no
longer
required
him
to
remain
there
he
put
his
watch
back
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
but
not
into
the
one
from
which
he
had
taken
it
for
he
noticed
that
in
that
one
it
came
in
contact
with
the
key
of
the
iron
door
which
the
imânus
had
brought
him
and
there
was
danger
of
breaking
the
crystal
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
taking
the
turning
towards
the
forest
he
fancied
he
saw
a
feint
ray
of
light
he
turned
and
through
the
underbrush
which
all
at
once
stood
out
against
a
red
background
thus
revealing
its
minutest
details
with
absolute
distinctness
he
beheld
a
bright
glare
along
the
ravine
very
near
the
spot
where
he
was
standing
at
first
he
turned
in
that
direction
then
changed
his
mind
as
the
folly
of
exposing
himself
to
that
light
occurred
to
him
whatever
it
might
be
it
was
really
no
affair
of
his
in
any
event
once
more
he
started
to
follow
directions
and
advanced
several
steps
towards
the
forest
all
at
once
buried
and
hidden
by
the
brambles
as
he
was
he
heard
above
his
head
a
terrible
cry
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
very
edge
of
the
plateau
above
the
ravine
the
marquis
raised
his
eyes
and
paused

deus
i
found
but
lost
illustration
when
michelle
fléchard
first
perceived
the
tower
reddened
by
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
it
was
more
than
a
league
away
and
this
woman
nothing
daunted
by
the
distance
though
scarcely
able
to
put
one
foot
before
the
other
kept
bravely
on
her
way
women
may
be
weak
but
mothers
are
strong
the
sun
had
set
twilight
came
on
followed
by
the
darkness
of
night
as
she
walked
along
far
away
in
the
distance
from
some
invisible
belfry
probably
that
of
parigné
she
heard
the
clock
strike
eight
then
nine
from
time
to
time
she
paused
to
listen
to
something
that
sounded
like
heavy
blows
but
it
might
have
been
only
the
uncertain
noises
peculiar
to
the
night
she
walked
straight
onward
crushing
the
furze
and
prickly
heather
beneath
her
bleeding
feet
she
was
guided
by
a
faint
light
issuing
from
the
distant
keep
which
bathed
the
tower
in
a
mysterious
glow
while
it
defined
its
outlines
against
the
surrounding
gloom
this
light
changed
in
measure
as
the
sounds
grew
loud
or
faint
the
vast
plateau
across
which
michelle
fléchard
made
her
way
was
completely
covered
with
grass
and
heather
neither
house
nor
tree
was
to
be
seen
its
rise
was
almost
imperceptible
and
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
its
long
line
was
clearly
defined
against
the
dark
horizon
dotted
with
stars
she
was
supported
as
she
climbed
by
the
sight
of
the
tower
constantly
before
her
eyes
and
as
she
drew
nearer
it
gradually
increased
in
size
as
we
have
just
remarked
the
muffled
reports
and
the
pallid
gleams
of
light
that
issued
from
the
tower
were
intermittent
dying
away
and
then
returning
as
they
did
it
seemed
to
the
wretched
mother
in
her
distress
like
some
agonizing
enigma
suddenly
they
ceased
and
with
the
sound
the
light
too
died
away
there
was
a
moment
of
absolute
silence
an
appalling
tranquillity
and
then
it
was
that
michelle
fléchard
reached
the
edge
of
the
plateau
she
saw
beneath
her
feet
a
ravine
whose
depths
were
hidden
by
the
dim
shadows
of
night
at
a
short
distance
on
the
top
of
the
plateau
the
confused
mass
of
wheels
slopes
and
embrasures
which
formed
the
battery
and
before
her
indistinctly
lighted
by
the
burning
matches
of
the
guns
an
enormous
edifice
that
seemed
built
of
shadows
blacker
than
those
that
surrounded
it
this
building
consisted
of
a
bridge
whose
arches
rested
in
the
ravine
together
with
a
kind
of
castle
erected
on
the
bridge
both
castle
and
bridge
supported
by
a
round
and
lofty
mass
of
masonry
this
was
the
tower
which
had
been
that
mother
distant
goal
one
could
see
the
lights
moving
to
and
fro
behind
the
of
the
tower
and
it
was
evident
from
the
noise
issuing
therefrom
that
it
was
crowded
with
men
whose
shadows
were
projected
even
as
high
as
platform
michelle
fléchard
could
distinguish
the
vedettes
of
the
camp
near
the
battery
but
the
darkness
and
the
underbrush
concealed
her
from
their
view
she
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
was
so
close
to
the
bridge
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
almost
touch
it
with
her
hand
the
deep
ravine
alone
separated
her
from
it
she
could
distinguish
even
in
the
darkness
the
three
stories
of
the
she
knew
not
how
long
she
had
been
standing
there
having
lost
all
consciousness
of
time
absorbed
in
a
silent
contemplation
of
that
yawning
chasm
and
the
gloomy
building
what
was
it
that
was
going
on
within
was
this
the
tourgue
she
felt
that
restless
sense
of
expectation
peculiar
to
travellers
who
have
either
just
arrived
or
are
on
the
eve
of
departure
as
she
stood
listening
and
gazing
around
she
tried
to
think
why
she
was
there
suddenly
all
objects
vanished
before
her
eyes
a
veil
of
smoke
had
suddenly
obscured
the
object
she
was
watching
a
sharp
pain
forced
her
to
close
her
eyes
but
she
had
no
sooner
done
so
than
a
light
flashed
upon
them
so
intensely
brilliant
that
her
eyelids
seemed
transparent
and
when
she
opened
them
again
the
night
had
changed
into
day
but
the
light
of
that
day
dreadful
to
look
upon
was
born
of
fire
what
she
saw
was
the
outburst
of
a
conflagration
the
smoke
had
changed
from
black
to
scarlet
from
which
at
times
a
mighty
flame
leaped
forth
with
those
fierce
contortions
peculiar
to
the
lightning
and
the
serpent
it
darted
forth
like
a
tongue
from
some
monstrous
jaw
but
it
was
really
a
window
filled
with
fire
whose
iron
bars
were
already
red
hot
a
casement
in
the
lower
story
of
the
and
the
only
part
of
the
entire
building
that
could
now
be
seen
even
the
plateau
was
shrouded
in
the
smoke
and
the
edge
of
the
ravine
alone
could
be
distinguished
against
the
crimson
flames
michelle
fléchard
looked
on
in
amazement
smoke
is
a
cloud
dreams
come
from
the
clouds
hardly
realizing
what
she
saw
she
knew
not
what
to
do
should
she
stay
or
try
to
make
her
escape
she
almost
felt
herself
transported
beyond
the
actual
world
there
came
a
gust
of
wind
that
rent
the
curtain
of
smoke
and
revealed
through
this
gap
the
tragic
bastile
in
all
its
grandeur
with
its
keep
its
bridge
and
its
castle
dazzling
and
terrible
magnificently
gilded
by
the
light
of
the
flames
which
were
reflected
upon
it
from
summit
to
base
michelle
fléchard
could
see
everything
by
the
awful
glare
of
the
flames
only
the
lower
story
of
the
was
as
yet
burning
above
it
could
be
seen
the
two
other
stories
still
intact
though
resting
as
it
were
upon
a
bed
of
flames
from
the
edge
of
the
plateau
where
she
stood
through
the
smoke
and
fire
michelle
fléchard
caught
an
occasional
glimpse
of
the
interior
all
the
windows
were
open
through
those
of
the
second
story
which
were
very
large
she
could
see
cases
along
the
walls
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
filled
with
books
and
in
front
of
one
of
the
windows
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
shadow
she
noticed
a
little
group
whose
outline
had
no
definite
form
it
lay
in
a
heap
like
a
nest
or
brood
of
young
birds
and
from
time
to
time
she
thought
she
saw
it
stir
she
watched
it
what
could
this
little
group
of
shadows
be
sometimes
she
fancied
it
was
composed
of
living
forms
she
was
feverish
and
exhausted
for
she
had
not
eaten
a
mouthful
since
morning
had
walked
incessantly
and
she
felt
as
if
she
were
the
victim
of
some
sort
of
hallucination
which
she
instinctively
mistrusted
but
her
eyes
were
now
riveted
upon
this
dark
group
of
objects
whatsoever
they
might
be
doubtless
it
was
something
inanimate
lying
there
upon
the
floor
in
the
hall
directly
over
the
conflagration
suddenly
as
though
inspired
by
a
will
of
its
own
the
fire
flung
forth
a
jet
of
flame
upon
the
dead
ivy
that
mantled
the
very
wall
on
which
michelle
fléchard
stood
gazing
it
was
as
if
it
had
just
discovered
this
network
of
withered
branches
a
spark
greedily
seized
upon
it
and
the
fire
began
to
rise
from
twig
to
twig
with
the
frightful
rapidity
of
a
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
flame
reached
the
second
story
and
from
thence
a
light
was
thrown
into
the
one
below
a
vivid
glare
brought
into
instantaneous
relief
three
little
sleeping
children
it
was
a
charming
group
their
little
legs
and
arms
intertwined
their
eyelids
closed
their
faces
sweetly
smiling
the
mother
knew
her
children
she
uttered
a
terrible
cry
that
cry
of
inexpressible
anguish
is
given
only
to
mothers
no
sound
can
be
more
savage
and
yet
pathetic
uttered
by
a
woman
it
is
like
the
cry
of
a
and
when
one
hears
it
from
a
wolf
it
might
well
come
from
a
woman
this
cry
of
michelle
fléchard
was
a
howl
hecuba
howled
homer
tells
us
and
this
was
the
cry
just
heard
by
the
marquis
de
lantenac
we
saw
him
pause
to
listen
he
was
between
the
outlet
of
the
passage
through
which
halmalo
had
guided
him
in
his
escape
and
the
ravine
through
the
tangled
wildwood
about
him
he
saw
the
burning
bridge
and
the
tourgue
reddened
by
the
reflection
he
pushed
aside
the
branches
and
discovered
on
the
opposite
side
above
his
head
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
in
front
of
the
burning
castle
and
in
the
full
light
of
the
conflagration
the
haggard
and
woful
face
of
a
woman
bending
over
the
ravine
this
face
was
no
longer
the
face
of
michelle
fléchard
it
was
a
medusa
there
is
something
formidable
in
intense
agony
this
peasant
woman
had
changed
into
one
of
the
eumenides
the
unknown
rustic
low
ignorant
stupid
had
suddenly
taken
on
the
epic
proportions
of
despair
great
sorrows
expand
the
soul
to
gigantic
proportions
this
mother
was
the
embodiment
of
maternity
a
summary
of
humanity
rises
to
the
superhuman
she
stood
towering
above
the
edge
of
the
ravine
within
sight
of
the
conflagration
in
presence
of
that
crime
like
a
power
from
beyond
the
grave
moaning
like
a
wild
beast
she
stood
in
the
attitude
of
a
goddess
with
a
countenance
like
a
flaming
mask
hurling
forth
imprecations
nothing
could
have
been
more
imperious
than
the
lightning
that
flashed
from
those
eyes
drowned
in
tears
her
look
was
like
a
thunderbolt
hurled
against
the
conflagration
the
marquis
listened
these
reproaches
fell
upon
his
head
he
heard
her
inarticulate
cries
more
like
sobs
than
words
my
children
oh
my
lord
they
are
my
children
help
fire
fire
fire
you
must
be
brigands
is
there
no
one
here
but
my
children
will
be
burned
to
death
such
doings
georgette
my
children
what
can
this
mean
who
put
my
children
there
they
are
sleeping
i
am
mad
oh
this
is
impossible
help
meanwhile
a
great
commotion
was
going
on
in
the
tourgue
and
on
the
plateau
the
whole
camp
had
rushed
to
the
fire
which
had
just
broken
out
the
besiegers
after
encountering
the
had
now
to
struggle
against
the
fire
gauvain
cimourdain
and
guéchamp
were
giving
orders
what
could
be
done
a
few
buckets
of
water
might
possibly
be
drawn
from
the
slender
stream
in
the
ravine
the
edge
of
the
plateau
was
covered
with
terrified
faces
gazing
at
the
sight
with
distress
and
it
was
an
awful
scene
illustration
there
they
stood
looking
on
but
none
could
lend
a
helping
hand
by
way
of
the
ivy
the
flames
had
risen
to
the
upper
story
and
finding
there
a
granary
filled
with
straw
had
rushed
upon
it
and
that
entire
granary
was
now
on
fire
the
flames
merrily
dancing
a
dreadful
sight
is
the
glee
of
a
fire
it
was
like
the
breath
of
fiends
fanning
a
funereal
pile
one
could
fancy
that
the
terrible
imânus
was
in
person
there
metamorphosed
into
a
whirlwind
of
sparks
living
in
this
cruel
life
of
flame
and
that
his
horrible
soul
had
been
transformed
into
a
conflagration
the
flames
had
not
yet
reached
the
library
story
its
lofty
ceiling
and
massive
walls
had
retarded
the
fatal
moment
that
was
now
drawing
near
the
flames
like
tongues
of
fire
darted
upward
from
the
story
below
while
the
flames
from
above
touched
the
stones
as
if
carressing
them
with
the
dread
kiss
of
death
beneath
it
lay
a
cave
of
lava
above
an
arch
of
fiery
coals
were
the
floor
to
cave
in
all
would
be
precipitated
into
a
bed
of
ashes
were
the
ceiling
to
give
way
they
would
be
buried
beneath
the
glowing
coals
and
georgette
had
not
yet
waked
they
were
sleeping
the
sound
and
innocent
sleep
of
childhood
and
through
the
sheets
of
flame
and
smoke
which
now
hid
now
revealed
the
windows
they
could
be
seen
in
this
fiery
grotto
against
a
background
of
meteoric
light
calm
graceful
and
motionless
like
three
heavenly
cherubs
confidingly
slumbering
in
hell
a
tiger
might
have
wept
to
see
such
blossoms
in
that
furnace
their
cradles
in
the
grave
illustration
meanwhile
the
mother
wrung
her
hands
fire
fire
i
am
crying
fire
are
they
all
deaf
that
no
one
comes
they
arc
burning
up
my
children
come
you
men
over
yonder
to
think
of
the
days
and
days
i
have
walked
and
to
find
them
like
this
fire
help
they
are
angels
nothing
short
of
angels
what
have
those
innocents
done
they
shot
me
and
now
they
are
burning
them
who
does
such
things
as
these
help
save
my
children
do

me
if
i
were
a
dog
you
would
have
pity
on
me
my
children

are
asleep

see
her
dear
little
body
those
are
their
names
you
can
see
well
enough
that
i
am
their
mother
such
abominable
doings
go
on
in
these
days
i
have
walked
for
days
and
nights
why
i
talked
about
them
this
very
morning
to
a
woman
help
help
fire
they
must
be
monsters
this
is
horrible
the
oldest
one

not
five
years
old
and
the
baby
not
two
i
can
see
their
little
naked
legs
they
are
asleep
holy
virgin
heaven
gives
them
to
me
and
hell
snatches
them
back
again
just
think
how
far
i
have
walked
the
children
that
i
fed
with
my
milk
i
who
felt
so
wretched
because
i
could
find
them
have
pity
on
me
i
want
my
children
i
must
have
them
and
to
think
of
them
there
in
the
fire
see
my
poor
bleeding
feet
help
it
can
not
be
that
there
are
men
on
earth
who
would
let
those
poor
little
creatures
die
like
that
help
murder
who
ever
saw
the
like
ah
the
brigands
what
is
that
dreadful
house
they
stole
them
from
me
to
murder
them
merciful
jesus
i
want
my
children
oh
i
do
know
what
to
do
they
must
not
die
help
help
help
oh
i
shall
curse
heaven
if
they
die
like
that
simultaneously
with
the
mother
entreaty
other
voices
rang
out
on
the
plateau
and
the
ravine
a
ladder
there
is
none
water
none
to
be
had
up
in
the
tower
there
in
the
second
story
there
is
a
door
it
is
iron
break
it
in
impossible
here
the
mother
redoubled
her
desperate
appeals
fire
help
make
haste
or
kill
me
at
once
my
children
my
children
oh
that
terrible
fire
throw
me
into
the
fire
but
save
their
lives
in
the
intervals
between
her
cries
could
be
heard
the
constant
crackling
of
the
flames
the
marquis
felt
in
his
pocket
and
his
hand
met
the
key
to
the
iron
door
then
stooping
below
the
arch
through
which
he
had
just
escaped
he
the
passage
from
which
he
had
so
lately
emerged
ii
from
the
door
of
stone
to
that
of
iron
illustration
a
whole
army
driven
half
wild
by
its
enforced
inaction
in
the
presence
of
danger
four
thousand
men
unable
to
save
three
children
such
was
the
situation
in
point
of
fact
they
had
no
ladder
the
one
sent
from
javené
had
not
arrived
the
flames
spread
as
from
a
yawning
crater
it
was
simply
absurd
to
attempt
to
extinguish
them
with
the
water
from
the
brook
in
the
ravine
one
might
as
well
empty
a
glass
of
water
into
a
volcano
cimourdain
guéchamp
and
radoub
had
gone
down
into
the
ravine
gauvain
had
returned
to
the
hall
on
the
second
story
of
the
tourgue
where
the
turning
stone
the
secret
passage
and
the
iron
door
of
the
library
were
to
be
found
it
was
there
that
the
sulphur
match
had
been
lighted
by
the
imânus
and
there
the
fire
had
originated
gauvain
had
brought
with
him
twenty
sappers
their
last
resource
was
to
force
open
the
iron
door
its
fastenings
were
terribly
strong
they
went
at
it
with
their
axes
dealing
violent
blows
the
axes
broke
one
of
the
sappers
exclaimed
steel
shivers
like
glass
against
that
iron
in
fact
the
door
was
composed
of
double
sheets
of
bolted
together
each
sheet
three
inches
thick
then
they
took
iron
bars
and
tried
to
pry
the
door
open
from
below
the
iron
bars
broke
one
would
think
they
were
matches
said
the
sapper
nothing
less
than
a
could
open
that
door
muttered
gauvain
gloomily
we
should
have
to
mount
a
up
here
but
even
then
replied
the
sapper
for
a
moment
they
stood
in
despair
and
their
arms
fell
helpless
by
their
sides
with
a
sense
of
defeat
these
men
stood
in
speechless
dismay
gazing
upon
that
door
so
awful
in
its
immobility
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
red
reflection
from
beneath
it
behind
them
the
fire
was
spreading
the
frightful
body
of
the
imânus
was
there
dread
victor
that
he
was
but
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
entire
building
might
fall
into
ruins
what
could
they
do
the
last
ray
of
hope
was
gone
gauvain
whose
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
revolving
stone
and
the
opening
through
which
the
escape
had
been
made
cried
in
the
bitterness
of
his
exasperation
and
yet
the
marquis
de
lantenac
escaped
through
that
door
and
returns
said
a
voice
against
the
stone
setting
of
the
secret
passage
appeared
a
white
head
it
was
the
marquis
it
was
many
a
year
since
gauvain
had
seen
him
so
close
at
hand
he
drew
back
every
man
present
stood
as
if
petrified
the
marquis
held
a
large
key
in
his
hand
with
one
haughty
glance
he
compelled
the
sappers
who
stood
in
his
path
to
make
way
for
him
walked
at
once
to
the
iron
door
stooped
beneath
the
arch
and
put
the
key
into
the
lock
it
creaked
in
the
lock
the
door
opened
they
saw
the
fiery
gulf
the
marquis
entered
it
with
head
erect
and
steady
step
he
strode
forward
and
those
who
looked
on
shuddered
as
their
eyes
followed
his
receding
form
he
had
barely
taken
a
few
steps
in
the
burning
hall
before
the
inlaid
floor
undermined
by
the
fire
and
shaken
by
his
tread
gave
way
behind
him
setting
a
chasm
between
him
and
the
door
the
marquis
pursued
his
way
never
once
turning
his
head
and
vanished
in
the
smoke
nothing
more
was
seen
had
he
succeeded
in
making
his
way
or
had
another
fiery
chasm
opened
under
his
feet
or
had
he
but
ended
his
own
life
no
one
could
tell
a
wall
of
smoke
and
flames
rose
before
them
whether
dead
or
alive
the
marquis
was
on
the
other
side
iii
where
the
sleeping
children
wake
meanwhile
the
little
ones
had
at
last
opened
their
eyes
the
fire
although
it
had
not
yet
reached
the
library
cast
a
red
reflection
on
the
ceiling
it
was
not
the
kind
of
dawn
the
children
knew
they
were
gazing
at
it
georgette
utterly
absorbed
the
conflagration
showed
forth
all
its
glories
the
black
hydra
and
the
scarlet
dragon
appeared
amid
the
in
all
their
sombre
and
vermilion
hues
great
sparks
shot
out
into
the
distance
lighting
up
the
gloom
like
contending
comets
pursuing
one
another
fire
is
a
prodigal
its
furnaces
abound
in
jewels
which
they
scatter
to
the
winds
and
it
is
to
some
purpose
that
charcoal
is
identical
with
the
diamond
from
the
fissures
opened
in
the
wall
of
the
third
story
the
embers
were
showering
down
into
the
ravine
like
cascades
of
jewels
the
heaps
of
straw
and
oats
burning
in
the
granary
began
to
pour
in
a
stream
through
the
windows
like
avalanches
of
the
oats
changing
to
amethysts
and
the
straw
to
carbuncles
pretty
cried
georgette
all
three
were
now
sitting
up
ah
cried
the
mother
they
are
awake
when
rose
then
rose
also
and
georgette
followed
stretched
himself
and
going
towards
the
window
exclaimed
i
am
hot
me
hot
repeated
georgette
the
mother
called
them
children
rené
alain
georgette
the
children
looked
round
they
were
trying
to
find
out
what
it
all
meant
where
men
feel
terrified
children
are
simply
curious
he
who
is
open
to
surprise
is
not
easily
alarmed
ignorance
is
closely
allied
to
intrepidity
children
have
so
little
claim
upon
hell
that
were
they
to
behold
it
it
would
but
excite
their
admiration
the
mother
kept
repeating
rené
alain
georgette
turned
that
voice
roused
him
from
his
reverie
children
have
short
memories
but
their
recollections
are
swift
the
entire
past
is
for
them
but
as
yesterday
when
saw
his
mother
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
natural
thing
that
could
happen
surrounded
as
he
was
by
strange
things
and
with
a
dim
consciousness
of
needing
support
he
called
mamma
mamma
said
repeated
georgette
and
she
stretched
out
her
little
arms
the
mother
shrieked
my
children
the
three
children
came
to
the
fortunately
the
conflagration
was
not
on
this
side
i
am
too
warm
said
then
added
it
burns
and
he
looked
for
his
mother
why
do
you
come
mamma
he
said
tum
repeated
georgette
the
mother
with
her
hair
streaming
torn
and
bleeding
as
she
was
let
herself
roll
from
bush
to
bush
down
into
the
ravine
there
stood
cimourdain
and
guéchamp
as
powerless
in
their
position
as
gauvain
was
in
his
the
soldiers
in
despair
at
their
helplessness
were
swarming
around
them
the
heat
would
have
seemed
unbearable
had
any
one
noticed
it
they
were
discussing
the
escarpment
of
the
bridge
the
height
of
the
arches
and
of
the
different
stories
the
inaccessible
windows
and
the
necessity
for
speedy
action
three
stories
to
climb
with
no
means
of
access
radoub
wounded
by
a
in
the
shoulder
his
ear
lacerated
dripping
with
sweat
and
blood
had
appeared
upon
the
scene
he
saw
michelle
fléchard
what
have
we
here
the
woman
who
was
shot
come
to
life
again
my
children
cried
the
mother
you
are
right
replied
radoub
this
is
no
time
to
inquire
about
ghosts
and
he
started
to
scale
the
bridge
a
useless
attempt
he
dug
his
nails
into
the
stone
clung
thus
for
a
few
seconds
but
the
smooth
layers
of
stone
offered
neither
cleft
nor
projection
they
were
as
accurately
fitted
one
upon
the
other
as
if
the
wall
had
just
been
built
and
radoub
fell
back
the
fire
was
still
increasing
terrible
to
behold
they
could
see
the
three
fair
heads
framed
in
the
window
lighted
by
the
glowing
flames
then
radoub
shook
his
fist
towards
heaven
as
though
he
beheld
some
one
and
exclaimed
has
almighty
god
no
mercy
the
mother
kneeling
clasped
her
arms
around
one
of
the
piers
of
the
bridge
crying
mercy
the
hollow
sound
of
crashing
timbers
mingled
with
the
crackling
of
the
flames
the
glass
doors
of
the
bookcases
in
the
library
cracked
and
fell
with
a
crash
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
woodwork
was
giving
way
human
strength
was
of
no
avail
one
moment
and
the
entire
building
would
be
swallowed
up
in
the
abyss
they
were
only
waiting
for
the
final
catastrophe
the
little
voices
could
be
heard
repeating
mamma
mamma
they
were
in
paroxysms
of
terror
suddenly
against
the
crimson
background
of
the
flames
a
tall
figure
came
into
view
standing
in
the
window
next
to
the
one
where
the
children
stood
all
heads
were
raised
all
eyes
were
riveted
upon
the
spot
a
man
up
there
in
the
hall
of
the
library
a
man
in
that
furnace
his
face
looked
black
against
the
flames
but
his
hair
was
white
they
recognized
the
marquis
de
lantenac
he
vanished
but
only
to
appear
again
illustration
this
appalling
old
man
stood
in
the
window
managing
an
enormous
ladder
it
was
the
which
had
been
lying
along
the
library
wall
and
which
he
had
dragged
to
the
window
he
seized
one
end
of
it
and
with
the
masterly
agility
of
an
athlete
he
let
it
slip
out
of
the
window
over
the
outer
ledge
down
into
the
depths
of
the
ravine
radoub
standing
below
wild
with
excitement
received
the
ladder
in
his
outstretched
arms
and
clasping
it
to
his
breast
cried
long
live
the
republic
long
live
the
king
replied
the
marquis
you
may
cry
what
you
please
muttered
radoub
and
talk
all
the
nonsense
you
like
you
are
a
very
angel
of
mercy
the
ladder
was
firmly
planted
and
communication
thereby
established
between
the
burning
hall
and
the
ground
twenty
men
led
by
radoub
rushed
forward
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
grouped
themselves
on
the
ladder
from
top
to
bottom
leaning
back
against
the
rungs
like
masons
carrying
stones
up
and
down
thus
forming
a
human
ladder
over
the
wooden
one
radoub
standing
on
the
uppermost
rung
facing
towards
the
fire
was
just
on
a
level
with
the
window
the
little
army
dispersed
across
the
heath
and
along
the
slopes
overcome
by
contending
emotions
hastened
towards
the
plateau
down
into
the
ravine
and
up
to
the
platform
of
the
tower
again
they
lost
sight
of
the
marquis
but
he
reappeared
carrying
a
child
in
his
arms
the
applause
was
tremendous
he
had
caught
up
the
first
child
that
came
within
his
reach
and
it
chanced
to
be
who
cried
out
i
am
frightened
the
marquis
handed
him
to
radoub
who
passed
him
on
to
a
soldier
standing
just
behind
him
a
little
farther
down
who
in
his
turn
delivered
him
to
the
next
one
and
while
screaming
with
terror
was
thus
transferred
from
hand
to
hand
until
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
the
marquis
disappearing
for
a
moment
returned
to
the
window
with
who
struggling
and
crying
slapped
radoub
just
as
the
marquis
handed
him
to
the
sergeant
again
the
marquis
went
back
into
the
burning
room
georgette
was
the
only
one
left
she
smiled
and
this
man
of
granite
felt
the
tears
spring
to
his
eyes
what
is
your
name
he
asked
she
said
he
took
her
still
smiling
in
his
arms
and
as
he
gave
her
to
radoub
his
conscience
austerely
pure
albeit
darkened
succumbed
to
the
overpowering
charm
of
innocence
and
the
old
man
kissed
the
child
it
is
the
little
midget
exclaimed
the
soldiers
and
so
georgette
in
her
turn
amid
the
cries
of
admiration
was
also
passed
from
hand
to
hand
till
she
reached
the
ground
the
soldiers
clapped
their
hands
and
stamped
their
feet
the
old
grenadiers
sobbed
aloud
as
she
smiled
upon
them
the
mother
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
panting
frantic
intoxicated
by
this
sudden
transition
from
hell
to
paradise
excess
of
joy
tears
the
heart
in
a
fashion
of
its
own
she
held
out
her
arms
first
receiving
then
then
georgette
she
covered
them
with
frenzied
kisses
then
bursting
into
a
laugh
she
fell
swooning
to
the
ground
then
rose
a
loud
cry
all
are
saved
and
so
indeed
they
were
except
the
old
man
but
no
one
thought
of
him
not
even
he
himself
perhaps
for
several
instants
he
stood
dreamily
near
the
as
though
he
would
give
the
fiery
abyss
time
to
make
up
its
mind
then
deliberately
slowly
and
proudly
he
stepped
over
the
and
without
turning
holding
himself
upright
and
perfectly
erect
with
his
back
towards
the
rungs
the
conflagration
behind
and
the
precipice
before
and
beneath
him
with
all
the
majesty
of
a
supernatural
being
he
proceeded
to
descend
the
ladder
in
silence
those
who
were
on
the
ladder
rushed
down
a
thrill
ran
through
the
witnesses
and
they
drew
back
in
holy
horror
before
this
man
who
was
approaching
them
like
a
vision
but
stately
and
grave
he
continued
his
descent
into
the
darkness
before
him
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
as
they
recoiled
before
his
approach
his
marble
pallor
revealed
not
a
wrinkle
his
eyes
cold
as
steel
neither
glittered
nor
flashed
as
he
drew
near
these
men
whose
startled
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
in
the
darkness
he
seemed
to
grow
at
every
step
the
ladder
shook
and
echoed
beneath
his
ominous
tread
he
might
have
been
compared
to
the
statue
of
the
commander
returning
to
his
tomb
when
he
reached
the
bottom
and
had
stepped
from
the
last
rung
of
the
ladder
to
the
ground
a
hand
seized
him
by
the
collar

turned

they
led
him
away
the

dungeon
on
the
of
the

was
forthwith
reopened
under
cimourdain
severe
superintendence
a
lamp
was
placed
there
a
jug
of
water
and
a
loaf
of
soldier
bread
a
bundle
of
straw
was
flung
in
and
in
less
than
a
quarter

the
the

gauvain
made
no

and
cimourdain
preoccupied
with
the
important
business
that
lay
before
him
departed
he
now
had
to
appoint
the
hour
and
select
the
place
like
lequinio
at
granville
talien
at
bordeaux
châlier
at
lyons
and
at
strasbourg
he
had
made
a
practice
of
superintending
executions
in
person
it
was
regarded
as
an
excellent
example
this
supervision
on
the
part
of
the
judge
of
the
work
a
custom
borrowed
by
the
terror
of
from
the
parliaments
of
france
and
the
spanish
inquisition
gauvain
himself
was
preoccupied
a
cold
wind
blew
from
the
forest
he
left
guéchamp
to
give
the
necessary
orders
went
into
his
tent
which
was
in
the
meadow
on
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
at
the
foot
of
the
tourgue
and
taking
his
hooded
cloak
wrapped
himself
in
it
this
cloak
was
trimmed
with
that
simple
galoon
which
in
accordance
with
the
republican
fashion
averse
to
decoration
designated
the
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
this
bloody
field
where
the
assault
was
begun
there
he
was
alone
the
fire
though
scarcely
heeded
had
not
yet
ceased
to
bum
radoub
was
with
the
mother
and
children
almost
as
motherly
as
she
herself
the
was

consumed

completing
the
work

flames
they
dug
ditches
buried
the
dead
cared
for
the
wounded
demolished
the

removed
the
dead
bodies
from
the
rooms
and
the
staircases
the
men
were
at
work
purifying
the
scene
of
carnage
sweeping
away
the
mass
of
horrible
filth
and
setting
matters
in
order
after
the
battle
with
military
rapidity
gauvain
took
no
note
of
all
this
activity
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
hardly
glanced
at
the
sentries
guarding
the
breach
doubled
by
the
order
of
cimourdain
he
could
distinguish
this
breach
amid
the
darkness
about
two
hundred
paces
from
that
part
of
the
field
in
which
he
had
found
refuge
he
saw
that
black
opening
there
the
attack
began
three
hours
ago
this
was
the
breach
through
which
gauvain
had
made
his
way
into
the
tower
there
was
the
with
the
the
marquis
opened
on
to
that
floor
the
sentries
posted
near
the
breach
guarded
the
dungeon
while
thus
he
gazed
absently
upon
it
these
words
returned
confusedly
to
his
ears
like
the
tolling
of
a
funeral
knell
the
the
guillotine
the
day
after
the
fire
which
had
been
isolated
and
upon
which
the
sappers
had
dashed
all
the
water
that
they
could
obtain
still
resisted
their
efforts
to
extinguish
it
and
continued
to
shoot
forth
occasional
jets
of
flame
now
and
then
was
heard
the
cracking
of
the
ceilings
and
the
crashing
of
the
stories
as
they
fell
one
upon
another
then
showers
of
sparks
flew
about
as
from
a
whirling
torch
revealing
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
extreme
limit
of
the
horizon
and
the
shadow
cast
by
the
tourgue
would
grow
to
colossal
size
extending
to
the
very
edge
of
the
forest
gauvain
walked
slowly
back
and
forth
in
this
shadow
in
front
of
the
breach
now
and
then
he
clasped
both
his
hands
behind
his
head
covered
by
his
military
hood
he
was
thinking
illustration
ii
gauvain
meditating
his
reverie
was
fathomless
an
unheard
of
change
had
taken
place
the
marquis
de
lantenac
had
been
transfigured
and
gauvain
had
seen
it
with
his
own
eyes
he
would
never
have
believed
it
possible
that
such
a
state
of
things
could
have
come
to
pass
from
any
complication
of
events
whatsoever
even
in
a
dream
he
could
not
have
imagined
such
a
condition
of
affairs
the
unforeseen
that
inexplicable
force
that
makes
a
man
the
plaything
of
its
capricious
will
had
seized
gauvain
and
held
him
fast
before
his
eyes
he
beheld
the
realization
of
the
impossible
visible
palpable
inevitable
inexorable
and
what
did
he
think
of
it
this
was
no
time
for
evasion
he
must
make
up
his
mind
a
question
had
been
presented
to
him
he
must
meet
it
fairly
who
had
asked
this
question
it
had
come
to
him
in
the
course
of
events
but
not
through
events
alone
for
when
events
which
are
ever
changing
ask
us
a
question
immutable
justice
summons
us
to
answer
behind
the
cloud
that
casts
the
shadow
is
the
star
that
sheds
the
light
we
can
no
more
escape
the
light
than
the
shadow
gauvain
was
undergoing
an
interrogatory
he
had
been
arraigned
before
a
judge
an
presence
his
own
conscience
his
entire
being
was
vacillating
within
him
his
firmest
resolutions
his
most
solemn
promises
his
most
irrevocable
determinations
were
all
shaken
to
their
foundations
the
soul
has
its
earthquakes
the
more
he
reflected
upon
what
he
had
just
witnessed
the
more
confused
he
grew
gauvain
republican
as
he
was
believed
himself
to
be
and
was
just
but
a
superior
law
had
been
revealed
human
law
takes
a
higher
stand
than
the
law
of
revolutions
this
affair
now
in
progress
could
not
be
evaded
it
was
a
serious
matter
and
gauvain
formed
a
part
of
it
he
was
involved
in
it
and
could
not
extricate
himself
and
however
much
cimourdain
might
say
this
matter
no
longer
concerns
you
he
felt
all
the
sensations
of
a
tree
torn
up
by
its
roots
every
man
has
a
basis
a
shock
to
this
basis
produces
a
serious
disturbance
and
this
was
what
gauvain
now
felt
he
pressed
his
head
between
his
hands
as
if
to
express
from
it
the
truth
it
was
no
easy
task
to
gain
a
clear
idea
of
a
situation
like
his
nothing
could
be
more
uncomfortable
he
saw
before
him
a
formidable
array
of
ciphers
to
be
added
up
to
add
up
the
columns
of
human
destiny
the
bare
thought
made
him
dizzy
and
yet
he
was
endeavoring
to
do
this
he
was
trying
to
explain
matters
to
himself
to
collect
his
ideas
to
subdue
the
resistance
that
he
felt
within
him
and
to
review
the
facts
he
revolved
them
again
and
again
in
his
mind
is
there
one
among
us
who
has
not
been
called
upon
to
consider
some
important
subject
in
all
its
bearings
or
has
not
asked
himself
at
a
serious
crisis
which
road
to
follow
whether
to
advance
or
to
retreat
gauvain
had
been
witness
to
a
miracle
while
the
earthly
combat
was
still
in
progress
a
celestial
one
had
begun
a
contest
between
good
and
evil
a
merciless
heart
had
just
been
conquered
in
the
man
before
him
with
all
the
evil
inherent
to
his
nature
violence
error
blindness
an
unwholesome
obstinacy
selfishness
and
pride
gauvain
had
witnessed
a
miracle
a
victory
won
by
humanity
over
the
man
the
human
victorious
over
the
inhuman
and
by
what
means
how
was
it
achieved
how
had
it
overthrown
a
colossus
of
anger
and
hatred
what
weapons
had
it
used
what
machinery
of
warfare
simply
the
cradle
to
gauvain
it
was
positively
bewildering
to
the
very
midst
of
civil
war
at
the
climax
of
hostility
and
vengeance
in
the
darkest
and
fiercest
moment
of
the
tumult
when
crime
lent
all
its
fires
and
hatred
all
its
blackness
at
the
very
crisis
of
the
struggle
when
anything
may
serve
for
a
missile
when
the
mêlée
is
so
direful
that
man
is
lost
to
every
sense
of
justice
honesty
and
truth
suddenly
from
the
unknown
that
mysterious
monitor
of
the
human
soul
overpowering
all
the
lights
and
shadows
of
humanity
came
one
broad
flash
of
the
everlasting
light
above
that
fatal
duel
between
falsehood
and
comparative
truth
the
face
of
absolute
truth
had
suddenly
risen
from
the
depths
the
strength
of
the
weak
had
suddenly
intervened
the
triumph
of
three
poor
little
beings
but
lately
born
into
the
world
unconscious
of
wrong
orphans
forsaken
and
alone
lisping
and
smiling
with
all
the
gorgons
of
civil
war
retaliation
the
terrible
logic
of
reprisals
murder
carnage
fratricide
wrath
and
malice
had
just
been
witnessed
together
with
the
failure
and
defeat
of
an
infamous
conflagration
kindled
with
criminal
intent
cruelty
had
been
frustrated
and
baffled
ancient
feudal
ferocity
inexorable
disdain
the
professed
experience
of
the
necessities
of
war
reasons
of
state
all
the
arrogant
resolves
of
savage
old
age
vanished
before
the
innocent
blue
eyes
of
infant
life
and
what
could
be
more
simple
the
infant
whose
little
life
has
just
begun
has
done
no
evil
it
is
the
embodiment
of
justice
truth
and
innocence
the
highest
angels
of
heaven
dwell
in
little
children
and
truly
it
was
an
edifying
sight
these
frenzied
combatants
in
a
merciless
war
had
in
the
face
of
all
their
evil
deeds
their
crimes
fanaticism
and
murder
vengeance
fanning
the
funeral
piles
death
advancing
torch
in
hand
suddenly
seen
innocence
rise
in
its
omnipotence
above
this
countless
legion
of
crimes
and
innocence
had
won
the
day
one
might
well
say
no
civil
war
has
no
existence
there
are
no
such
evils
as
barbarism
hatred
or
crime
there
is
no
darkness
the
divine
dawn
of
infancy
has
but
to
rise
and
all
these
spectres
will
straightway
vanish
never
in
any
struggle
had
the
presence
of
satan
and
of
almighty
god
been
more
plainly
visible
a
conscience
had
furnished
the
arena
for
this
combat
it
was
the
conscience
of
lantenac
and
again
it
was
renewed
more
desperate
and
possibly
more
decisively
than
ever
in
another
conscience
in
the
conscience
of
gauvain
what
a
is
the
mind
of
man
our
thoughts
like
gods
monsters
or
giants
hold
us
in
their
power
sometimes
those
terrible
wrestlers
trample
our
very
soul
beneath
their
feet
gauvain
was
thinking
the
marquis
de
lantenac
hemmed
in
blockaded
condemned
outlawed
confined
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
circus
held
like
a
nail
in
a
vice
immured
in
his
own
home
that
had
changed
into
a
prison
encompassed
on
every
side
by
a
wall
of
iron
and
fire
had
eluded
his
enemies
and
stolen
away
he
had
effected
a
miraculous
escape
he
had
achieved
a
masterpiece
the
most
difficult
of
all
accomplishments
in
a
war
like
this
flight
he
had
regained
possession
of
the
forest
to
intrench
himself
therein
of
the
district
where
he
would
renew
the
combat
and
of
the
impenetrable
shadows
among
which
he
might
vanish
from
sight
once
more
he
had
become
formidable
ever
on
the
wing
a
whose
presence
boded
evil
the
captain
of
invisible
forces
the
leader
of
men
who
dwell
beneath
the
ground
the
master
of
the
woods
gauvain
was
victorious
but
lantenac
was
free
henceforth
lantenac
was
safe
his
career
unfettered
asylums
without
number
from
which
to
choose
he
was
intangible
unapproachable
inaccessible
this
lion
caught
in
a
snare
had
forced
his
way
out
and
now
behold
he
had
come
back
to
it
the
marquis
de
lantenac
had
voluntarily
impelled
only
by
his
free
will
left
the
shades
of
the
forest
where
safety
and
freedom
awaited
him
to
return
to
the
most
frightful
danger
first
gauvain
had
seen
it
himself
rushing
with
fearless
spirit
into
the
flames
that
threatened
to
engulf
him
and
again
descending
that
ladder
that
was
to
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
same
ladder
that
offered
escape
to
others
but
to
him
absolute
ruin
and
why
had
he
done
this
to
save
three
children
and
what
were
they
now
about
to
do
with
this
man
guillotine
him
and
so
this
man
for
the
sake
of
three
children
his
own
no
of
his
kin
perhaps
not
at
all
belonging
to
his
own
rank
in
life
by
no
means
for
three
little
beggars
chance
children
foundlings
unknown
to
him
ragged
and
barefooted
this
nobleman
this
prince
this
old
man
who
had
made
his
escape
who
was
both
a
free
man
and
a
victor
for
escape
is
a
triumph
in
itself
had
risked
everything
compromised
his
own
safety
imperilled
the
cause
and
while
restoring
the
children
he
offered
up
his
own
head
this
head
hitherto
terrible
but
now
august
and
what
were
they
about
to
do
with
it
to
accept
it
the
marquis
de
lantenac
had
had
the
opportunity
to
choose
between
the
life
of
others
and
his
own
and
when
this
splendid
option
lay
before
him
he
chose
his
death
and
it
was
to
be
granted
him
they
would
put
him
to
death
what
a
reward
for
heroism
to
return
a
generous
action
by
a
deed
of
barbarity
to
cast
this
reproach
upon
the
revolution
thus
to
humiliate
the
republic
while
he
a
man
still
in
the
bondage
of
prejudices
and
slavery
suddenly
assumed
another
form
and
the
lists
of
humanity
they
the
champions
of
deliverance
and
freedom
would
still
remain
plunged
in
civil
war
with
its
routine
of
blood
and
fratricide
and
they
who
fought
on
the
side
of
error
respected
the
supreme
law
of
divine
forgiveness
of
abnegation
of
redemption
and
of
sacrifice
while
for
the
soldiers
of
truth
it
had
apparently
ceased
to
exist
what
was
there
to
be
no
rivalry
in
magnanimity
were
they
who
were
now
in
the
ascendant
to
resign
themselves
to
defeat
to
acknowledge
their
weakness
to
take
advantage
of
their
victory
to
commit
murder
and
to
allow
men
to
say
that
while
the
defenders
of
monarchy
save
little
children
republicans
kill
old
men
this
grand
soldier
this
powerful
octogenarian
this
disarmed
warrior
betrayed
rather
than
captured
seized
in
the
very
act
of
doing
a
good
deed
bound
by
his
own
consent
with
the
moisture
of
a
superb
devotion
still
upon
his
brow
would
be
seen
mounting
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
as
if
borne
upward
in
an
apotheosis
and
they
would
offer
to
the
knife
that
head
round
which
the
three
souls
of
the
little
angels
he
had
saved
would
hover
in
supplication
and
standing
face
to
face
with
a
death
so
infamous
for
the
executioners
a
smile
would
be
seen
on
the
face
of
that
man
while
a
blush
of
shame
would
overspread
that
of
the
republic
and
that
was
to
take
place
in
the
presence
of
gauvain
the
chief
and
he
possessing
the
power
to
prevent
this
was
he
to
hold
his
peace
was
he
to
content
himself
with
that
haughty
dismissal
you
have
no
further
concern
in
this
matter
and
not
to
realize
that
in
a
case
like
this
abdication
of
authority
was
equivalent
to
complicity
and
could
he
not
see
that
in
a
deed
so
outrageous
the
coward
who
allows
the
act
is
worse
than
the
man
who
commits
it
but
had
he
not
promised
that
this
death
should
take
place
had
not
he
gauvain
the
merciful
declared
that
lantenac
was
to
be
excluded
from
mercy
and
that
he
would
deliver
him
to
cimourdain
this
head
was
a
debt
which
he
owed
and
he
paid
it
that
was
all
but
was
this
indeed
the
same
head
hitherto
gauvain
had
seen
in
lantenac
nothing
but
a
barbarous
warrior
enslaved
by
the
fanaticisms
of
royalty
and
feudality
the
murderer
of
prisoners
an
assassin
let
loose
by
war
a
man
of
blood
and
of
that
man
he
felt
no
fear
this
proscriber
of
others
he
would
himself
proscribe
this
relentless
man
would
find
him
relentless
also
nothing
could
be
more
simple
the
road
was
already
mapped
out
and
terribly
plain
to
follow
all
had
been
anticipated
he
who
had
killed
others
was
now
to
suffer
the
same
fate
they
were
in
the
direct
path
of
the
horrible
suddenly
this
straight
line
changed
an
unlooked
for
turn
revealed
a
new
horizon
a
transformation
had
been
effected
lantenac
had
appeared
on
the
scene
in
an
unexpected
character
a
hero
had
come
forth
from
the
monster
yea
one
greater
than
a
hero
a
man
something
higher
than
a
mind
a
heart
he
stood
before
gauvain
no
longer
a
murderer
but
a
saviour
gauvain
was
overwhelmed
by
a
flood
of
celestial
light
lantenac
had
felled
him
to
the
ground
by
a
thunderbolt
of
virtue
and
had
not
this
transfigured
lantenac
in
his
turn
the
power
to
transfigure
gauvain
what
was
this
flood
of
light
to
meet
with
no
responsive
flash
was
the
man
of
the
past
to
lead
the
van
of
progress
and
the
man
of
the
future
to
fall
back
to
the
rear
was
the
man
of
barbarism
and
superstition
suddenly
to
spread
his
wings
and
soar
upward
all
the
while
gazing
down
at
the
man
with
the
lofty
ideal
groping
below
him
in
the
mire
amid
the
murky
shadows
of
the
night
gauvain
would
lie
prostrate
in
the
savage
old
rut
while
lantenac
soared
higher
and
higher
in
his
new
career
and
another
thing
must
be
considered
the
family
this
blood
that
he
was
about
to
shed
for
to
allow
its
shedding
amounted
to
the
same
as
shedding
it
himself
was
not
this
his
own
blood
his
grandfather
was
dead
it
is
true
but
his
still
lived
in
the
person
of
the
marquis
de
lantenac
would
not
he
who
already
rested
in
the
grave
rise
to
bar
the
entrance
against
his
brother
would
he
not
lay
his
command
upon
his
grandson
henceforth
to
pay
the
same
veneration
to
that
crown
of
white
hair
as
to
his
own
halo
would
not
the
indignant
glance
of
a
departed
spirit
rise
between
gauvain
and
lantenac
was
it
then
the
object
of
revolution
to
destroy
the
natural
affections
to
sever
all
family
ties
and
to
stifle
every
sense
of
humanity
far
from
it
the
dawn
of
came
to
affirm
those
higher
truths
and
not
to
deny
them
the
destruction
of
bastilles
signified
the
deliverance
of
humanity
the
overthrow
of
feudalism
was
the
signal
for
the
building
up
of
the
family
since
authority
takes
rise
from
and
is
centred
in
its
author
there
can
be
no
real
authority
save
in
fatherhood
thus
we
see
the
legitimacy
of
the
who
gives
birth
to
her
subjects
and
combines
the
mother
with
the
queen
and
also
the
absurdity
of
the
who
not
being
the
father
has
no
right
to
be
the
master
hence
the
suppression
of
the
king
and
the
rise
of
the
republic
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
it
is
family
humanity
revolution
revolution
is
the
accession
of
the
people
and
in
reality
the
people
is
man
it
had
now
become
important
to
ascertain
whether
since
lantenac
had
returned
to
humanity
gauvain
would
return
to
the
family
the
question
was
whether
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
would
meet
again
in
the
higher
light
or
whether
the
decline
of
the
nephew
would
correspond
to
the
progress
of
the
uncle
in
this
pathetic
struggle
between
gauvain
and
his
conscience
the
question
thus
presented
itself
and
the
answer
seemed
instinctive
lantenac
must
be
saved
yes
but
france
here
the
puzzling
problem
suddenly
assumed
a
different
aspect
what
france
at
the
last
extremity
betrayed
exposed
to
attack
on
all
sides
dismantled
her
moat
was
gone
germany
could
cross
the
rhine
her
walls
were
overthrown
italy
might
leap
over
the
alps
and
spain
over
the
pyrenees
all
that
was
left
to
her
was
the
ocean
whose
infinite
abyss
was
on
her
side
she
could
lean
against
it
and
giantess
as
she
was
supported
by
the
expanse
of
the
sea
fight
the
whole
world
an
invincible
position
one
might
well
call
it
but
no
she
was
on
the
point
of
losing
this
position
the
ocean
was
no
longer
her
own
england
lay
in
this
sea
though
she
knew
not
how
to
cross
it
well
there
stood
a
man
ready
to
throw
a
bridge
across
to
lend
her
a
helping
hand
a
man
who
was
about
to
say
to
pitt
to
cornwallis
to
dundas
to
the
pirates
come
a
man
who
would
cry
out
england
come
over
and
seize
upon
france
and
this
man
was
the
marquis
de
lantenac
whom
they
now
held
in
their
grasp
after
three
months
of
an
eager
passionate
chase
they
had
finally
seized
him
the
hand
of
revolution
had
swooped
down
upon
the
accursed
one
the
clenched
fist
of
grasped
the
royalist
murderer
by
the
collar
and
by
one
of
those
mysterious
dispensations
of
providence
which
enter
into
human
affairs
it
was
in
his
own
family
dungeon
that
the
parricide
now
awaited
his
punishment
the
feudal
lord
lay
in
the
feudal
oubliette
the
stones
of
his
own
castle
had
risen
and
closed
upon
him
thus
he
who
would
have
betrayed
his
country
was
himself
betrayed
by
his
own
castle
god
had
visibly
ordained
all
this
the
hour
of
doom
had
struck
and
revolution
had
turned
the
key
upon
the
public
enemy
he
could
no
longer
fight
neither
could
he
struggle
nor
work
further
harm
of
that
vendée
where
there
was
no
lack
of
arms
his
alone
was
the
brain
his
death
would
be
the
signal
for
the
close
of
the
war
tragic
climax
ardently
desired
after
all
the
massacre
and
carnage
he
had
caused
the
murderer
was
in
their
power
and
doomed
in
his
turn
to
die
and
was
there
a
man
who
could
wish
to
save
him
cimourdain
in
the
person
of
held
lantenac
or
as
one
might
call
him
the
spirit
of
monarchy
and
could
a
man
be
found
to
snatch
that
prey
from
these
brazen
talons
lantenac
around
whose
name
was
bound
that
sheaf
of
scourges
which
men
call
the
past
the
marquis
de
lantenac
was
in
the
tomb
the
heavy
door
of
eternity
had
closed
upon
him
and
would
one
appear
from
without
to
draw
back
the
bolt
this
social
malefactor
was
dead
and
with
him
had
perished
revolt
the
fratricidal
struggle
the
brutal
war
and
conceive
of
a
man
who
would
bring
him
back
to
life
oh
how
that
would
laugh
the
spectre
would
exclaim
good
i
am
still
alive
you
fools
with
what
zeal
he
would
begin
his
hideous
work
all
over
again
with
what
implacable
rejoicing
would
he
plunge
again
into
the
abyss
of
hatred
and
war
not
a
day
would
pass
before
houses
would
be
in
flames
prisoners
massacred
the
wounded
slain
women
shot
and
after
all
was
it
not
possible
that
gauvain
exaggerated
the
deed
that
so
fascinated
his
imagination
three
children
were
in
danger
of
death
lantenac
had
saved
them
but
who
had
imperilled
their
lives
was
it
not
lantenac
who
had
put
their
cradles
in
the
fire
was
it
not
the
imânus
who
was
the
imânus
the
lieutenant
of
the
marquis
it
is
the
chief
who
bears
the
responsibility
hence
lantenac
was
both
the
incendiary
and
the
assassin
why
then
was
his
deed
so
admirable
he
had
simply
desisted
from
evil
nothing
more
having
conceived
the
crime
he
had
recoiled
before
its
presence
he
was
horrified
at
himself
the
mother
shriek
had
stirred
within
him
the
dregs
of
human
pity
the
deposit
of
universal
life
which
exists
in
every
soul
even
in
the
most
cruel
at
this
cry
he
had
retraced
his
steps
from
the
darkness
towards
which
he
was
plunging
he
had
turned
back
towards
the
light
having
committed
the
crime
he
made
haste
to
retrieve
it
he
had
not
continued
a
monster
to
the
very
end
herein
lay
all
his
merit
and
in
return
for
so
small
a
thing
was
all
to
be
restored
to
him
his
liberty
the
fields
and
plains
the
open
air
daylight
the
forest
which
he
would
use
for
brigandage
his
own
freedom
that
he
might
use
it
to
plunge
others
into
slavery
his
own
life
which
he
would
devote
to
the
death
of
his
as
for
trying
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
as
for
attempting
to
treat
with
this
arrogant
soul
offering
to
save
his
life
under
conditions
to
ask
him
whether
he
would
agree
provided
his
life
were
spared
to
abstain
henceforth
from
hostility
and
revolt
what
a
mistake
would
such
an
offer
be
what
an
advantage
it
would
give
him
with
what
scorn
would
he
greet
the
proposal
how
he
would
scourge
the
question
by
the
answer
hear
him
exclaim
keep
such
indignities
for
yourselves
for
my
part
give
me
death
nothing
could
be
done
with
such
a
man
he
must
either
be
set
free
or
put
to
death
his
was
a
rugged
inaccessible
nature
ready
for
flight
ready
for
sacrifice
it
mattered
not
which
his
strange
soul
displayed
the
characteristics
of
the
eagle
as
well
as
of
the
precipice
to
kill
him
dreadful
to
contemplate
to
set
him
free
what
a
responsibility
suppose
lantenac
were
saved
it
would
simply
be
a
return
to
the
beginning
of
the
vendée
like
a
struggle
with
a
hydra
whose
head
is
not
yet
severed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
like
the
flash
of
a
meteor
all
the
flames
which
expired
when
this
man
vanished
would
be
rekindled
lantenac
would
never
rest
until
he
had
effected
his
detestable
plan
to
establish
monarchy
like
the
lid
of
a
tomb
over
the
republic
and
to
give
england
control
over
france
he
who
would
save
lantenac
must
sacrifice
france
lantenac
life
would
be
death
to
a
multitude
of
innocent
creatures
men
women
and
children
who
would
again
become
the
prey
of
civil
war
it
meant
the
landing
of
the
english
the
revolution
retarded
the
cities
sacked
the
inhabitants
distracted
brittany
tom
and
bleeding
in
short
it
would
be
like
tossing
back
his
prey
to
the
tiger
claws
and
gauvain
amid
all
this
uncertain
glimmering
of
gauvain
reverie
caught
a
vague
glimpse
of
the
problem
as
it
gradually
took
form
in
his
mind
the
setting
at
liberty
of
a
tiger
and
then
the
question
resumed
its
former
aspect
the
stone
of
sisyphus
which
is
nothing
less
than
the
conflict
of
man
with
his
own
conscience
recoiled
upon
him
was
lantenac
then
a
tiger
once
he
may
have
been
but
was
he
a
tiger
still
gauvain
grew
dizzy
with
conflicting
thoughts
thoughts
which
coiled
themselves
around
one
another
after
the
fashion
of
a
snake
could
one
after
mature
consideration
really
deny
the
devotion
of
lantenac
his
stoical
his
sublime
disinterestedness
what
after
he
had
shown
his
humanity
in
the
very
jaws
of
civil
war
what
when
in
the
conflict
between
inferior
truths
he
had
shown
forth
the
truth
that
stands
above
all
others
what
when
he
had
proved
that
the
deep
tenderness
of
human
nature
the
protection
that
strength
owes
to
weakness
the
duty
which
binds
every
man
who
is
saved
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
his
perishing
brother
the
fatherhood
which
every
old
man
owes
to
every
little
child
are
above
all
principalities
and
revolutions
above
all
earthly
questions
whatsoever
when
he
had
proved
the
truth
of
all
these
grand
things
and
proved
it
by
the
gift
of
his
own
head
what
general
as
he
was
to
have
renounced
strategy
battle
and
revenge
what
he
being
a
royalist
had
taken
the
scales
and
placing
in
one
end
the
king
of
france
the
monarchy
fifteen
centuries
old
the
restoration
of
ancient
laws
and
the
of
an
old
society
and
in
the
other
three
little
unknown
peasants
and
had
found
the
king
the
throne
the
sceptre
and
the
fifteen
centuries
of
monarchy
by
those
innocent
creatures
could
it
be
possible
that
all
this
was
to
count
for
nothing
was
he
who
had
done
this
to
remain
a
tiger
and
be
treated
like
a
wild
beast
no
no
no
he
was
no
monster
the
man
whose
divine
action
had
just
illumined
the
abyss
of
civil
war
the
had
been
transformed
into
a
messenger
of
light
the
infernal
satan
had
become
once
more
the
heavenly
lucifer
lantenac
had
expiated
all
his
cruel
deeds
by
one
act
of
sacrifice
his
moral
salvation
had
been
attained
by
way
of
his
material
ruin
he
had
returned
to
a
state
of
innocence
he
had
signed
his
own
pardon
does
hot
the
right
of
exist
henceforth
he
was
an
object
for
veneration
lantenac
had
just
proved
himself
a
remarkable
man
it
was
now
turn
to
make
fitting
response
the
struggle
between
the
passions
of
good
and
evil
was
fast
converting
the
world
into
chaos
lantenac
dominating
this
same
chaos
had
set
humanity
free
and
now
it
was
left
for
gauvain
to
assert
the
rights
of
the
family
what
was
he
about
to
do
was
he
to
betray
god
trust
no
and
he
muttered
to
himself
lantenac
must
be
saved
well
then
go
your
way
connive
with
the
english
desert
your
country
ally
yourself
with
her
enemy
save
lantenac
and
betray
france
here
he
shuddered
dreamer
that
thou
art
this
is
no
solution
and
gauvain
fancied
he
saw
in
the
shadow
the
baleful
smile
of
the
sphinx
this
combination
of
circumstances
was
like
a
platform
whereon
conflicting
truths
had
taken
their
stand
ready
for
the
encounter
and
where
the
three
loftiest
principles
of
mankind
humanity
family
and
country
stood
face
to
face
each
of
these
voices
spoke
in
turn
and
each
one
spoke
the
truth
how
was
a
man
to
choose
each
one
by
turns
seemed
to
have
discovered
the
point
of
union
between
justice
and
wisdom
and
said
act
thus
must
he
obey
this
voice
yes
no
reason
suggested
one
thing
sentiment
another
and
their
counsels
were
diametrically
opposed
logic
is
nothing
more
than
reason
sentiment
is
often
the
voice
of
the
conscience
the
one
comes
from
man
the
other
from
above
hence
the
perceptions
of
sentiment
are
less
clear
but
wield
a
stronger
influence
but
what
a
power
dwells
in
stern
reason
gauvain
hesitated
torturing
perplexities
two
abysses
opened
before
gauvain
to
destroy
the
marquis
or
to
save
him
into
one
or
the
other
he
must
needs
plunge
towards
which
of
these
two
did
duty
call
him
ii
the
commander
hood
the
question
had
indeed
resolved
itself
in
a
matter
of
duty
duty
arose
and
immutable
before
the
spirit
of
cimourdain
and
terrible
before
that
of
gauvain
simple
to
the
one
complex
devious
to
the
other
the
hour
of
midnight
sounded
then
one
without
realizing
where
he
was
going
gauvain
had
unconsciously
approached
the
entrance
of
the
breach
the
light
of
the
expiring
fire
cast
now
but
a
dim
reflection
the
plateau
on
the
other
side
of
the
tower
caught
the
light
and
became
visible
for
an
instant
only
to
vanish
as
the
clouds
of
smoke
obscured
the
flames
this
light
with
its
unexpected
flashes
and
sudden
darkening
shadows
exaggerated
the
surrounding
objects
and
gave
to
the
sentinels
of
the
camp
the
effect
of
phantoms
gauvain
lost
in
thought
unconsciously
watched
the
alternations
of
smoke
and
flame
there
seemed
to
him
a
strange
analogy
between
these
changes
of
light
and
shade
and
the
varied
phases
of
truth
in
his
own
mind
suddenly
between
two
clouds
of
smoke
a
flame
burst
forth
from
the
bed
of
dying
coals
threw
a
brilliant
light
on
the
summit
of
the
plateau
and
revealed
the
red
outlines
of
a
wagon
gauvain
gazed
upon
it
it
was
surrounded
by
horsemen
wearing
the
hats
of
gendarmes
he
concluded
that
this
must
be
the
same
one
that
he
had
seen
through
guéchamp
against
the
horizon
a
few
hours
before
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
there
were
men
on
the
wagon
who
appeared
to
be
unloading
it
the
object
which
they
were
removing
seemed
heavy
and
at
times
the
clanking
of
iron
could
be
heard
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
what
it
was
it
seemed
to
be
two
of
the
men
lowered
from
the
wagon
and
placed
on
the
ground
a
case
which
judging
from
its
shape
might
contain
some
triangular
object
the
flame
died
out
and
everything
was
dark
again
gauvain
wrapped
in
thought
gazed
steadily
before
him
upon
that
object
now
hidden
by
the
darkness
lanterns
were
lighted
and
men
could
be
seen
moving
to
and
fro
on
the
plateau
but
the
outlines
were
indistinct
and
moreover
gauvain
standing
as
he
did
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
ravine
could
only
discern
those
objects
which
were
close
to
the
edge
he
could
hear
the
voices
but
not
the
words
now
and
then
he
caught
the
echo
of
hammering
upon
the
wood
he
could
also
hear
a
grinding
metallic
sound
like
the
sharpening
of
a
scythe
it
struck
two
slowly
and
like
one
who
would
from
choice
take
two
steps
forward
and
three
back
gauvain
advanced
towards
the
breach
on
his
approach
the
sentinel
recognizing
in
the
dusk
the
commander
cloak
and
braided
hood
presented
arms
gauvain
entered
the
hall
on
the
lower
floor
which
had
been
transformed
into
a
a
lantern
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
cast
just
light
enough
so
that
one
could
cross
the
hall
without
treading
on
the
men
most
of
whom
lay
upon
the
straw
sound
asleep
there
they
lay
on
the
spot
where
but
a
few
hours
since
they
had
been
fighting
the
from
the
careless
sweeping
still
lay
scattered
about
beneath
them
and
was
not
very
comfortable
to
sleep
on
but
weary
as
they
were
they
could
sleep
in
spite
of
it
this
hall
had
been
the
terrible
spot
here
the
assault
had
been
made
yonder
men
had
roared
howled
gnashed
their
teeth
given
blow
for
blow
struck
down
the
enemy
and
in
their
turn
expired
many
of
their
men
had
fallen
dead
upon
this
floor
where
they
were
now
slumbering
the
same
straw
on
which
they
slept
had
been
drenched
with
the
blood
of
their
comrades
now
all
was
ended
all
the
blood
was
stanched
and
the
sabres
dried
the
dead
were
dead
peacefully
slumbering
such
is
war
and
it
may
be
no
longer
than
before
every
man
among
them
will
sleep
the
same
sleep
on
gauvain
entrance
some
of
the
sleepers
rose
among
them
the
officer
in
command
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
dungeon
gauvain
said
to
him
open
it
the
bolts
were
drawn
and
the
door
opened
gauvain
entered

idea
of
setting
the
straw
on
fire
would
have
had
his
labor
for
his
pains
no
risk
of
a
conflagration
for
the
prison
and
certain
suffocation
for
the
prisoner
when
the
door
turned
on
its
hinges
the
marquis
was
walking
up
and
down
in
his
prison
with
that
mechanical
pacing
to
and
fro
peculiar
to
caged
wild
animals
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
and
closing
door
he
looked
up
and
the
light
from
the
lamp
that
stood
on
the
floor
between
gauvain
and
himself
struck
full
upon
the
faces
of
both
men
they
looked
at
each
other
with
such
an
expression
that
each
stood
there
as
if
transfixed
the
marquis
burst
out
laughing
and
exclaimed
sir
many
years
have
passed
since
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
you
honor
me
by
your
visit
i
thank
you
nothing
could
please
me
more
than
a
little
conversation
for
i
was
beginning
to
be
bored
your
friends
are
wasting
their
time
proofs
of
identity
all
those
ceremonies
are
tedious
were
it
my
affair
i
should
proceed
more
rapidly
i
am
at
home
here
will
you
be
good
enough
to
come
in
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
it
is
original
is
it
not
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
and
queen
in
france
the
king
was
the
king
france
herself
was
the
queen
they
have
cut
off
the
king
head
and
married
the
queen
to
robespierre
and
to
this
pair
a
daughter
has
been
born
they
call
her
guillotine
and
it
seems
that
i
am
to
make
her
acquaintance
morning
i
shall
be
as
pleased
to
meet
her
as
i
am
to
meet
you
is
that
perchance
the
object
of
your
visit
have
you
been
promoted
shall
you
officiate
as
headsman
but
if
this
be
simply
a
visit
of
friendship
i
feel
grateful
you
may
perhaps
have
forgotten
viscount
what
a
nobleman
is
allow
me
to
present
you
to
one
behold
me
it
has
become
a
rare
specimen
it
believes
in
god
in
tradition
and
in
the
family
it
believes
in
its
ancestors
in
the
example
of
its
father
in
fidelity
in
loyalty
in
its
duty
towards
its
princes
in
reverence
for
ancient
laws
in
virtue
and
in
justice
and
it
would
order
you
to
be
shot
with
much
pleasure
will
you
do
me
the
favor
to
take
a
seat
i
must
ask
you
to
sit
upon
the
floor
since
there
is
no
in
this
salon
but
he
who
dwells
in
the
mire
may
well
sit
upon
the
ground
i
do
not
say
this
to
offend
you
for
that
which
is
mire
in
our
esteem
represents
the
nation
in
your
eyes
you
will
not
of
course
require
me
to
shout
for
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
this
is
an
old
room
in
my
house
where
in
former
times
the
lords
used
to
imprison
their
peasants
nowadays
it
is
the
peasants
who
imprison
the
lords
and
these
follies
men
call
revolution
it
seems
that
my
head
is
to
be
cut
off
in
hours
i
have
no
objection
to
offer
still
had
they
been
they
would
have
sent
me
my
which
is
upstairs
in
the
where
you
used
to
play
when
you
were
a
child
and
where
i
have
dandled
you
on
my
knee
sir
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
your
name
is
gauvain
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
you
have
noble
blood
in
your
veins
yes
the
very
same
blood
that
flows
in
mine
and
this
blood
which
has
made
a
man
of
honor
of
me
has
made
of
you
a
scoundrel
such
are
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
human
race
you
will
tell
me
that
it
is
not
your
fault
nor
is
it
mine
one
may
be
a
rascal
unconsciously
it
depends
upon
the
air
one
breathes
in
times
like
ours
no
man
is
responsible
for
what
he
does
revolution
is
the
scapegoat
for
all
mankind
for
your
great
criminals
are
supreme
innocents
what
blockheads
to
begin
with
yourself
allow
me
to
admire
you
yes
i
admire
a
youth
like
yourself
who
with
an
excellent
position
in
state
affairs
possessing
noble
blood
fit
to
be
shed
in
a
noble
cause
viscount
of
this
prince
of
brittany
a
duke
in
his
own
right
belonging
to
the
hereditary
peerage
of
france
which
is
about
all
that
a
sensible
man
can
desire
here
below
a
youth
who
being
such
as
he
is
amuses
himself
by
playing
a
part
like
yours
until
his
enemies
believe
him
a
scoundrel
and
his
friends
regard
him
as
an
idiot
by
the
way
give
my
regards
to
the
abbé
cimourdain
perfectly
at
his
ease
the
marquis
spoke
slowly
and
calmly
without
emphasis
in
his
society
voice
his
eyes
clear
and
tranquil
and
with
both
hands
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
he
paused
took
a
long
breath
and
then
continued
i
do
not
conceal
from
you
that
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
kill
you
as
i
stand
before
you
i
have
three
times
in
person
aimed
a
cannon
at
you
a
discourteous
proceeding
i
confess
but
it
would
be
relying
upon
a
false
maxim
did
we
allow
ourselves
to
fancy
that
in
time
of
war
the
enemy
proposes
to
make
himself
agreeable
for
we
are
in
a
state
of
war
nephew
everything
is
put
to
fire
and
sword
and
they
have
killed
the
king
besides
a
fine
century
he
paused
again
then
continued
and
when
one
thinks
that
none
of
these
things
would
have
happened
if
they
had
hung
voltaire
and
sent
rousseau
to
the
galleys
ah
those
men
of
intellect
what
a
scourge
they
were
for
what
crime
did
you
reproach
the
monarchy
the
abbé
pucelle
was
sent
to
his
abbey
of
corbigny
it
is
true
allowing
him
the
choice
of
conveyance
and
as
much
time
as
he
required
in
the
journey
and
as
for
your
monsieur
titon
who
was
begging
your
pardon
a
wretched
libertine
who
visited
abandoned
women
before
going
to
the
miracles
of
deacon
pâris
he
was
transferred
from
vincennes
to
the
fortress
of
ham
in
picardy
which
is
i
admit
rather
a
disagreeable
place
those
are
your
grievances
i
remember
them
for
i
too
inveighed
against
them
in
my
day
i
have
been
as
stupid
as
you
the
marquis
fumbled
in
his
pocket
as
though
he
expected
to
find
his
then
he
continued
but
not
so
wicked
we
talked
for
the
sake
of
talking
there
was
moreover
the
mutiny
of
demands
and
petitions
and
then
those
gentlemen
the
philosophers
appeared
upon
the
scene
whose
works
they
burned
they
would
have
done
better
had
they
burned
the
authors
court
intrigues
were
mixed
up
in
the
affair
then
came
all
the
dunces
turgot
quesnay
malesherbes
the
physiocratists
and
so
forth
and
the
wrangling
began
all
this
was
the
work
of
scribblers
and
rhymsters
the
encyclopædia
diderot
ah
the
malicious
scamps
fancy
a
man
like
the
king
of
prussia
joining
hands
with
them
i
would
have
made
short
work
with
all
those
ah
we
know
how
to
administer
justice
you
can
see
here
on
this
wall
the
mark
of
the
there
was
no
jesting
in
the
matter
no
no
let
us
abolish
scribblers
so
long
as
there
are
arouets
there
will
be
marats
so
long
as
there
are
men
who
scribble
there
will
be
wretches
who
murder
while
there
is
ink
there
will
be
black
stains
so
long
as
men
claws
can
hold
a
frivolous
nonsense
will
engender
atrocious
follies
books
are
the
authors
of
crime
the
word
has
a
double
signification
it
means
a
dream
and
it
means
a
monster
what
a
price
one
pays
for
all
this
idle
nonsense
what
is
it
you
keep
repeating
to
us
about
your
rights
the
rights
of
man
the
rights
of
the
people
has
it
any
sense
whatever
could
anything
be
more
stupid
utterly
imaginary
and
devoid
of
meaning
when
i
state
the
fact
that
havoise
the
sister
of
conan
brought
the
comté
of
bretagne
to
hoël
count
of
nantes
and
of
cornwall
from
whom
the
estate
descended
to
alain
fergant
the
uncle
of
that
bertha
who
married
alain
le
noir
lord
of
and
bore
unto
him
conan
le
petit
grandfather
of
guy
or
gauvain
de
thouars
our
ancestor
i
make
a
plain
statement
and
claim
my
rights
but
the
knaves
the
rascals
the
scoundrels
of
your
party
what
rights
do
they
claim
deicide
and
regicide
is
it
not
frightful
ah
the
ragamuffins
i
am
sorry
for
you
sir
still
you
come
of
that
proud
breton
blood
you
and
i
have
a
gauvain
de
thouars
for
our
grandfather
and
furthermore
we
have
an
ancestor
in
that
famous
duke
de
montbazon
a
peer
of
france
and
decorated
with
the
grand
collar
who
attacked
the
faubourg
de
tours
and
was
wounded
at
the
battle
of
arques
and
who
died
of
france
in
his
house
of
couzières
in
touraine
at
the
age
of
i
could
tell
you
of
the
duke
of
laudunois
son
of
the
lady
de
la
garnache
of
claude
de
lorraine
of
the
duke
de
chevreuse
of
henri
do
lenoncourt
and
of
françoise
de
but
to
what
purpose
monsieur
has
the
honor
of
being
an
idiot
and
he
delights
to
lower
himself
to
the
level
of
my
groom
learn
this
i
was
already
an
old
man
when
you
were
still
a
nursing
infant
i
watched
you
and
i
would
watch
you
still
as
you
grew
up
you
succeeded
in
degrading
yourself
since
we
ceased
to
meet
each
of
us
has
followed
his
inclinations
mine
have
led
me
in
the
direction
of
honesty
while
your
course
has
been
the
very
reverse
ah
i
know
not
how
all
this
will
end
but
your
friends
are
consummate
villains
oh
yes
i
acknowledge
it
is
all
very
fine
the
progress
is
marvellous
they
have
done
away
in
the
army
with
the
punishment
of
the
pint
of
water
inflicted
for
three
days
in
succession
on
drunken
soldiers
they
have
the
maximum
the
convention
bishop
gobel
monsieur
chaumette
and
monsieur
hébert
there
has
been
a
wholesale
extermination
of
the
past
from
the
bastille
to
the
calendar
the
saints
are
replaced
by
vegetables
very
well
citizens
be
our
masters
if
you
will
reign
over
us
take
your
ease
act
your
good
pleasure
stand
upon
no
ceremony
all
that
will
not
prevent
religion
from
being
religion
nor
alter
the
fact
that
royalty
has
occupied
fifteen
hundred
years
of
our
history
and
that
the
old
french
nobility
even
though
beheaded
stands
higher
than
you
and
as
to
your
sophistries
concerning
the
historical
right
of
royal
races
what
care
we
for
that
matter
chilpéric
was
really
nothing
but
a
monk
by
the
name
of
daniel
it
was
rainfroi
who
invented
chilpéric
to
annoy
charles
martel
we
know
that
as
well
as
you
that
is
not
the
question
the
question
is
this
that
there
shall
be
a
great
kingdom
old
france
a
country
where
men
consider
first
the
sacred
person
of
the
monarchs
absolute
rulers
of
the
state
then
the
princes
then
the
officers
of
the
crown
naval
and
military
as
well
as
the
controllers
of
finance
then
there
are
the
officers
of
justice
of
the
different
grades
followed
by
those
of
the
and
the
general
receipts
and
finally
the
police
of
the
kingdom
in
its
three
orders
all
this
was
fine
and
you
have
destroyed
it
you
have
destroyed
the
provinces
without
even
understanding
so
great
was
your
ignorance
what
the
provinces
were
the
genius
of
france
was
made
up
from
that
of
the
entire
continent
and
each
of
its
provinces
represents
a
special
virtue
of
europe
the
frankness
of
germany
is
to
be
found
in
picardy
the
generosity
of
sweden
in
champagne
the
industry
of
holland
in
burgundy
the
activity
of
poland
in
languedoc
the
grave
dignity
of
spain
in
gascony
the
wisdom
of
italy
in
provence
the
subtlety
of
greece
in
normandy
the
fidelity
of
switzerland
in
dauphiny
you
knew
nothing
of
all
this
you
have
broken
shattered
crushed
demolished
behaving
like
stupid
beasts
of
the
field
so
you
wish
to
have
no
more
nobles
very
well
you
shall
have
none
prepare
your
mourning
your
paladins
and
heroes
have
departed
bid
farewell
to
all
the
ancient
glories
find
me
a
at
the
present
time
if
you
can
you
are
all
trembling
for
your
skins
you
will
have
no
more
chevaliers
de
fontenoy
who
saluted
the
enemy
before
killing
him
you
will
have
no
more
combatants
in
silk
stockings
like
those
at
the
siege
of
lérida
you
will
have
no
more
of
those
days
of
military
glory
when
plumes
flashed
by
like
meteors
your
days
are
numbered
the
outrage
of
invasion
will
descend
upon
you
if
alain
ii
were
to
return
he
would
no
longer
find
a
clovis
to
confront
him
if
abdérame
were
to
come
back
he
would
encounter
no
such
foe
as
charles
martel
neither
would
the
saxons
find
a
pépin
waiting
for
them
you
will
have
no
agnadel
rocroy
lens
staffarde
nerwinde
steinkerque
la
marsaille
raucoux
lawfeld
mahon
you
will
never
have
another
marignan
with
francis
nor
a
bouvines
with
who
took
renaud
count
of
boulogne
prisoner
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
held
ferrand
count
of
flanders
you
will
have
agincourt
but
you
will
not
have
the
great
the
sieur
de
bacqueville
wrapping
himself
in
his
banner
to
die
go
on
go
on
accomplish
your
work
be
the
new
men
dwarf
yourselves
here
the
marquis
paused
a
moment
then
he
continued
but
leave
to
us
our
greatness
kill
the
kings
kill
nobles
and
priests
if
you
will
sow
broadcast
over
the
land
destruction
ruin
and
death
trample
all
things
under
foot
set
your
heel
upon
the
ancient
laws
overthrow
the
throne
stamp
upon
the
altar
of
your
god
and
dance
over
the
ruins
all
rests
with
you
cowards
and
traitors
as
you
are
incapable
of
and
sacrifice
i
have
said
all
that
i
have
to
say
now
have
me
guillotined
monsieur
le
vicomte
i
have
the
honor
to
be
your
most
humble
servant
then
he
added
it
is
but
the
truth
what
difference
can
it
make
to
me
i
am
dead
you
are
free
said
gauvain
and
he
advanced
towards
the
marquis
unfastened
his
and
throwing
it
over
the
shoulders
of
the
latter
he
drew
the
hood
down
over
his
eyes
both
men
were
of
the
same
height
what
is
this
that
you
are
doing
said
the
marquis
gauvain
raised
his
voice
and
called
out
lieutenant
open
to
me
the
door
was
opened
gauvain
cried
you
will
be
careful
to
close
the
door
behind
me
and
he
pushed
the
astonished
marquis
across
the
threshold
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
low
hall
which
had
been
turned
into
a
was
lighted
by
a
horn
lantern
whose
dim
rays
served
only
to
deepen
the
shadows
it
threw
an
uncertain
glimmer
on
the
surrounding
objects
and
in
this
indistinct
light
those
of
the
soldiers
who
were
not
sleeping
saw
a
tall
man
walk
past
them
towards
the
entrance
wrapped
in
the
cloak
and
braided
hood
of
the
the
soldiers
saluted
him
as
he
passed
out
the
marquis
slowly
crossed
the
and
the
breach
not
without
hitting
his
head
more
than
once
and
went
out
the
sentinel
supposing
that
it
was
gauvain
whom
he
saw
presented
arms
once
outside
within
two
hundred
steps
of
the
forest
feeling
the
turf
beneath
his
feet
and
space
the
protecting
night
liberty
and
life
before
him
he
paused
and
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
like
a
man
who
has
allowed
himself
to
be
influenced
has
been
overcome
by
surprise
and
who
having
taken
advantage
of
an
open
door
asks
himself
whether
he
has
acted
nobly
or
ignobly
and
hesitates
before
going
on
giving
ear
as
it
were
to
an
afterthought
after
some
moments
of
deep
reverie
he
raised
his
right
hand
and
snapping
his
thumb
and
finger
cried
faith
and
he
went
on
the
door
of
the
prison
had
closed
again
and
this
time
it
was
upon
gauvain
ii
the
nearly
all
the
of
this
period
were
arbitrary
tribunals
in
the
legislative
assembly
dumas
had
drawn
up
a
rough
plan
of
military
legislation
afterwards
improved
by
talbot
in
the
council
of
the
five
hundred
but
the
final
code
of
councils
of
war
was
not
drawn
up
until
the
time
of
the
empire
from
that
time
also
be
it
mentioned
by
way
of
parenthesis
dates
the
law
imposed
on
military
tribunals
in
regard
to
the
taking
of
votes
that
of
beginning
with
the
lower
grade
this
law
was
not
in
existence
during
the
revolution
in
the
president
of
a
military
tribunal
might
almost
be
said
to
personify
the
tribunal
itself
he
elected
the
members
arranged
the
order
of
the
ranks
and
regulated
the
method
of
voting
he
was
master
as
well
as
judge
cimourdain
had
selected
the
identical
room
on
the
where
the
had
been
and
where
the
guard
was
now
posted
for
the
of
the
he
was
anxious
to
shorten
everything
the
road
from
the
prison
to
the
tribunal
and
the
passage
from
the
tribunal
to
the
scaffold
in
accordance
with
his
orders
the
court
opened
its
session
at
noon
with
no
more
display
of
ceremonial
than
three
straw
chairs
a
pine
table
two
lighted
candies
and
a
stool
placed
in
front
of
the
table
the
chairs
were
for
the
judges
and
the
stool
was
for
the
prisoner
at
each
end
of
the
table
stood
another
stool
one
for
the
who
was
a
quartermaster
and
the
other
for
the
clerk
who
was
a
corporal
on
the
table
there
was
a
stick
of
red
a
copper
seal
of
the
republic
two
inkstands
bundles
of
white
paper
and
two
printed
placards
spread
wide
open
one
containing
the
sentence
of
outlawry
the
other
the
decree
of
the
convention
the
middle
chair
was
pushed
back
against
a
group
of
tricolored
flags
in
those
times
of
rude
simplicity
decorations
were
quickly
arranged
and
but
little
time
was
needed
to
change
a
into
a
court
of
justice
the
middle
chair
intended
for
the
president
faced
the
prison
door
the
audience
was
composed
of
soldiers
two
gendarmes
stood
on
guard
beside
the
stool
cimourdain
was
seated
in
the
middle
chair
with
captain
guéchamp
the
first
judge
on
his
right
and
sergeant
radoub
the
second
on
his
left
he
wore
a
hat
with
tricolored
plumes
a
sabre
by
his
side
and
two
pistols
on
his
belt
his
scar
of
a
vivid
red
increased
the
ferocity
of
his
appearance
radoub
had
at
last
consented
to
allow
his
wounds
to
be
dressed
he
wore
a
handkerchief
tied
round
his
head
on
which
a
was
gradually
extending
at
noon
before
the
court
opened
a
messenger
stood
beside
the
table
of
the
tribunal
while
his
horse
impatiently
pawed
the
ground
outside
cimourdain
was
writing
and
this
was
what
he
wrote
members
of
the
com
of
public
safety
lantenac
is
taken
he
will
be
executed
after
dating
and
signing
the
despatch
he
folded
and
sealed
it
and
then
handed
it
to
the
messenger
who
took
his
leave
whereupon
cimourdain
said
in
a
loud
voice
open
the
dungeon
two
gendarmes
drew
back
the
bolts
opened
the
dungeon
and
went
in
cimourdain
raised
his
head
crossed
his
arms
glanced
at
the
door
and
exclaimed
bring
forth
the
prisoner
beneath
the
archway
of
the
open
door
appeared
a
man
between
the
two
gendarmes
it
was
gauvain
cimourdain
started
gauvain
he
cried
then
continued
i
demand

prisoner

said
gauvain

lantenac

cimourdain
trembled
as
he
murmured
true
it
is
his
own
castle
he
is
familiar
with
all
its
outlets
the
crypt
perhaps
communicates
with
one
of
them
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
this
he
probably
found
means
of
escape
he
would
need
no
help
he
has
been
helped
said
gauvain
to
escape
to
escape
who
helped
him
i
thou
i
thou
art
dreaming
i
went
into
the
dungeon
i
was
alone
with
the
prisoner
i
took
off
my
cloak
and
wrapped
it
about
him
i
drew
the
hood
over
his
face
he
went
out
in
my
stead
while
i
remained
in
his
here
i
am
thou
hast
not
done
this
i
have
it
is
impossible
it
is
true
bring
me
lantenac
he
is
no
longer
here
the
soldiers
seeing
the
took
him
for
me
and
allowed
him
to
pass
it
was
still
dark
thou
art
mad
i
tell
you
what
happened
a
silence
ensued
cimourdain
stammered
then
thou
deservest
death
said
gauvain
cimourdain
was
as
pale
as
a
corpse
and
as
motionless
as
a
man
who
has
been
struck
by
lightning
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
power
of
breathing
a
great
drop
of
sweat
formed
upon
his
forehead
he
controlled
his
voice
forcing
himself
to
speak
firmly
as
he
said
gendarmes
seat
the
accused
gauvain
took
his
seat
on
the
stool
cimourdain
continued
gendarmes
draw
your
sabres
this
was
the
usual
formula
when
the
accused
was
under
sentence
of
death
the
gendarmes
bared
their
sabres
cimourdain
voice
regained
its
ordinary
tone
accused
he
said
rise
he
no
longer
used
the
familiar
thee
and
thou
iii
the
votes
gauvain
rose
what
is
your
name
asked
cimourdain
gauvain
was
the
reply
cimourdain
went
on
with
the
interrogatory
who
are
you
i
am
of
the
expeditionary
column
of
the
are
you
a
kinsman
or
connection
of
the
man
who
has
escaped
i
am
his
are
you
acquainted
with
the
decree
of
the
convention
i
see
the
placard
on
your
table
what
have
you
to
say
in
regard
to
this
decree
that
i
have
countersigned
it
and
have
ordered
its
execution
that
it
was
i
who
had
that
placard
written
to
which
my
name
is
affixed
choose
your
defender
i
will
defend
myself
you
may
speak
cimourdain
had
become
impassible
only
his
impassibility
was
more
like
the
calmness
of
a
rock
than
that
of
a
man
for
a
moment
gauvain
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
cimourdain
continued
what
have
you
to
say
in
your
defence
gauvain
slowly
raised
his
head
and
without
looking
at
any
one
replied
this
one
thing
has
prevented
me
from
seeing
another
a
good
deed
viewed
too
near
at
hand
hid
from
my
sight
hundreds
of
criminal
actions
on
the
one
side
an
aged
man
on
the
other
children
all
this
interfered
between
me
and
my
duty
i
forgot
the
burning
villages
the
ravaged
fields
the
massacred
prisoners
the
wounded
cruelly
put
to
death
the
women
shot
i
forgot
france
betrayed
to
england
i
have
set
at
liberty
the
country
murderer
i
am
guilty
when
i
speak
thus
i
seem
to
speak
against
myself
but
it
is
not
so
i
am
speaking
in
my
own
behalf
when
he
who
is
guilty
acknowledges
his
fault
he
saves
the
only
thing
worth
saving
honor
is
this
all
you
have
to
say
in
your
defence
returned
cimourdain
i
will
add
that
being
the
commander
i
should
have
set
an
example
and
that
you
in
turn
as
judges
must
offer
one
what
example
do
you
require
of
us
my
death
you
think
it
just
and
necessary
take
your
seat
the
quartermaster
who
was
rose
and
read
first
the
decree
pronouncing
the
sentence
of
outlawry
against
the
marquis
de
lantenac
second
that
of
the
convention
sentencing
to
death
any
one
whomsoever
who
should
aid
or
abet
the
escape
of
a
rebel
prisoner
he
ended
with
the
few
lines
printed
at
the
bottom
of
the
placard
forbidding
men
to
aid
or
abet
the
rebel
aforesaid
under
penalty
of
death
and
signed
of
the
expeditionary
column
gauvain
the
reading
ended
the
again
took
his
scat
cimourdain
crossing
his
arms
said
attention
accused
and
let
the
public
listen
look
on
and
keep
silence
the
law
lies
before
you
it
will
be
put
to
vote
the
sentence
will
be
determined
by
the
vote
of
the
majority
each
judge
will
in
turn
pronounce
his
decision
aloud
in
the
presence
of
the
accused
for
justice
has
nothing
to
conceal
cimourdain
continued
let
the
first
judge
cast
his
vote
speak
captain
guéchamp
captain
guéchamp
seemed
unconscious
of
the
presence
either
of
gauvain
or
cimourdain
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
placard
of
the
decree
as
if
he
were
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
an
abyss
were
hidden
by
his
downcast
lids
he
said
the
law
is
clearly
defined
the
judge
is
more
and
less
than
a
man
less
than
a
man
inasmuch
as
he
has
no
heart
more
than
a
man
in
that
he
wields
the
sword
in
the
year
of
the
building
of
the
city
of
rome
manlius
put
his
son
to
death
because
he
gained
a
victory
without
waiting
for
orders
that
infraction
of
discipline
required
an
expiation
here
the
law
has
been
violated
and
the
law
stands
higher
than
discipline
a
man
has
been
overcome
by
the
emotion
of
pity
and
the
country
is
once
more
endangered
pity
may
rise
to
the
level
of
a
crime
commander
gauvain
has
connived
at
the
escape
of
the
rebel
lantenac
gauvain
is
guilty
i
vote
for
death
write
it
down
clerk
said
cimourdain
the
clerk
wrote
captain
guéchamp
death
gauvain
said
in
a
firm
voice
guéchamp
you
have
voted
well
i
thank
you
cimourdain
continued
it
is
the
turn
of
the
second
judge
speak
sergeant
radoub
radoub
rose
and
turning
towards
gauvain
he
made
the
military
salute
exclaiming
if
that
is
the
way
things
are
going
then
guillotine
me
for
upon
my
most
sacred
word
of
honor
i
would
like
to
have
done
first
what
the
old
man
did
and
then
what
my
commander
did
when
i
beheld
that
man
of
eighty
rushing
into
the
flames
to
save
the
three
midgets
i
said
to
myself
man
you
are
a
brave
fellow
and
since
i
hear
that
it
was
my
commander
who
saved
this
old
man
from
your
beastly
guillotine
by
all
that
is
holy
i
say
you
ought
to
be
the
general
and
you
are
a
true
man
and
by
thunder
i
would
give
you
the
cross
of
if
there
were
any
crosses
or
saints
or
louises
left
are
we
going
to
make
idiots
of
ourselves
for
pity
sake
i
should
say
so
if
this
is
to
be
the
result
of
winning
the
battles
of
jemmapes
valmy
fleurus
and
wattignies
what
here
is
commander
gauvain
who
for
these
four
months
past
has
been
driving
those
donkeys
of
royalists
to
the
sound
of
the
drum
who
saves
the
republic
by
his
sword
and
who
did
something
at
dol
that
needed
brains
to
accomplish
it
and
when
you
have
a
man
like
that
you
try
to
get
rid
of
him
and
instead
of
making
him
your
general
you
propose
to
cut
his
throat
i
say
that
it
is
enough
to
make
one
throw
one
self
from
the
and
if
you
citizen
gauvain
were
only
a
corporal
instead
of
being
my
commander
i
would
tell
you
that
you
talked
a
heap
of
nonsense
just
now
the
old
man
did
well
when
he
saved
the
children
you
did
well
to
save
the
old
man
and
if
men
are
to
be
guillotined
for
their
good
actions
then
we
might
as
well
go
to
the
deuce
and
i
am
sure
i
know
what
it
all
means
there
is
nothing
to
depend
upon
this
must
be
a
sort
of
dream
is
it
i
pinch
myself
to
see
if
i
am
really
awake
i
do
understand
so
the
old
man
ought
to
have
let
the
midgets
burn
alive
and
my
commander
did
wrong
to
save
the
old
man
head
see
here
guillotine
me
i
wish
you
would
suppose
the
midgets
had
died
then
the
battalion
of
the
would
have
been
dishonored
is
that
what
they
wanted
if
that
is
the
case
then
let
us
destroy
one
another
i
know
as
much
about
politics
as
you
do
for
i
belonged
to
the
club
of
the
section
of
the
pikes
sapristi
we
are
getting
to
be
no
better
than
the
brutes
in
a
word
this
is
the
way
i
look
at
it
i
do
like
such
an
upsetting
state
of
affairs
why
the
devil
do
we
risk
our
lives
so
that
our
chief
may
be
put
to
death
none
of
that
lisette
i
want
my
chief
i
must
have
my
chief
i
love
him
better
than
i
did
yesterday
you
make
me
laugh
when
you
say
that
he
is
to
be
guillotined
we
have
nothing
of
the
sort
i
have
listened
you
may
say
what
you
please
but
let
me
tell
you
in
the
first
place
it
is
impossible
and
radoub
took
his
seat
his
wound
had
reopened
a
thin
stream
of
blood
oozed
from
under
the
bandage
from
the
place
where
his
ear
had
been
and
ran
along
his
neck
cimourdain
turned
towards
radoub
you
vote
that
the
accused
be
acquitted
i
vote
to
have
him
made
general
replied
radoub
i
ask
you
whether
you
vote
for
his
acquittal
illustration
i
vote
that
he
be
made
the
head
of
the
republic
sergeant
radoub
do
you
or
do
you
not
vote
for
captain
acquittal
yes
or
no
i
vote
that
you
behead
me
in
his
place
acquittal
said
cimourdain
write
it
down
clerk
then
the
clerk
announced
one
vote
for
death
one
for
acquittal
a
tie
it
was
cimourdain
turn
to
vote
he
rose
took
off
his
hat
and
placed
it
on
the
table
he
was
no
longer
pale
or
livid
his
face
was
the
color
of
clay
had
every
man
present
been
lying
in
his
shroud
the
silence
could
not
have
been
more
profound
in
solemn
measured
tones
cimourdain
said
gauvain
the
accused
your
case
has
been
heard
the
in
the
name
of
the
republic
by
a
majority
of
two
against
one
he
broke
off
he
seemed
to
pause
was
he
still
doubtful
whether
to
vote
for
death
or
for
life
the
audience
was
breathless
cimourdain
went
on
condemns
you
to
the
penalty
of
death
his
face
revealed
the
torture
of
an
awful
triumph
when
jacob
in
the
darkness
forced
a
blessing
from
the
angel
whom
he
had
overthrown
he
must
have
worn
the
same
terrible
smile
it
passed
like
a
flash
however
and
cimourdain
again
became
marble
he
took
his
seat
replaced
his
hat
on
his
head
and
added
gauvain
you
will
be
executed
at
sunrise
gauvain
rose
bowed
and
said
i
thank
the
court
remove
the
prisoner
said
cimourdain
and
at
a
sign
from
him
the
door
of
the
dungeon
was
reopened
gauvain
entered
and
it
closed
behind
him
two
gendarmes
with
drawn
sabres
were
stationed
on
each
side
of
the
door
radoub
who
had
just
fallen
senseless
was
carried
away
iv
after
cimourdain
the
judge
cimourdain
the
master
a
camp
is
a
wasps
nest
especially
in
time
of
revolution
the
civic
sting
which
exists
in
the
soldier
darts
forth
at
a
moments
notice
and
after
driving
out
the
enemy
will
often
turn
without
ceremony
upon
its
own
chief
the
brave
army
which
had
taken
the
tourgue
was
alive
with
conflicting
rumors
when
first
the
escape
of
lantenac
was
discovered
it
was
all
against
gauvain
but
when
the
latter
was
seen
coming
out
of
the
dungeon
where
they
had
supposed
lantenac
to
be
imprisoned
it
was
like
the
transmission
of
an
electric
spark
and
in
less
than
a
minute
the
whole
army
knew
of
it
a
murmur
broke
forth
from
the
little
band
at
first
it
ran
they
are
getting
ready
to
try
gauvain
but
it
is
all
a
farce
he
is
a
fool
who
trusts
these
and
calotins
we
have
just
seen
a
viscount
save
a
marquis
and
presently
we
shall
see
a
priest
acquit
a
noble
when
the
condemnation
of
gauvain
became
known
there
was
a
second
murmur
that
is
an
outrage
our
chief
our
brave
chief
our
young
commander
a
hero
he
is
a
viscount
to
be
sure
but
so
much
more
to
his
credit
that
he
is
also
a
republican
what
he
the
liberator
of
pontorson
of
villedieu
of
the
conqueror
of
dol
and
of
the
tourgue
the
man
who
has
made
us
invincible
the
sword
of
the
republic
in
the
vendée
he
who
for
five
months
holds
his
own
against
the
chouans
and
corrects
all
the
blunders
of
léchelle
and
others
and
cimourdain
dares
to
condemn
him
wherefore
because
he
saved
an
old
man
who
had
rescued
three
children
does
it
become
a
priest
to
put
a
soldier
to
death
thus
murmured
the
victorious
and
dissatisfied
camp
on
every
side
a
dull
sense
of
anger
prevailed
against
cimourdain
four
thousand
men
against
one
might
be
supposed
to
constitute
a
power
but
it
does
not
these
four
thousand
men
were
nothing
more
than
a
crowd
cimourdain
was
a
will
they
all
knew
that
his
frown
was
easily
provoked
and
this
knowledge
sufficed
to
hold
the
army
in
awe
in
those
times
it
needed
but
the
shadow
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
behind
a
man
to
make
him
formidable
and
to
convert
an
imprecation
into
a
whisper
and
that
whisper
into
silence
before
as
well
as
after
their
murmuring
cimourdain
was
absolute
master
of
the
fate
of
all
as
well
as
of
that
of
gauvain
they
knew
that
it
would
be
vain
to
entreat
him
that
he
would
listen
only
to
his
conscience
that
superhuman
voice
audible
to
himself
alone
everything
depended
upon
him
what
he
had
done
simply
in
his
capacity
of
military
judge
he
could
undo
as
civil
delegate
he
alone
could
pardon
there
were
no
limits
to
his
authority
it
needed
but
a
sign
from
him
to
set
gauvain
at
liberty
life
and
death
were
in
his
hands
the
guillotine
was
at
his
command
in
this
tragic
moment
he
held
supreme
authority
there
was
no
resource
but
to
wait
the
night
came
the
dungeon
once
more
the
hall
of
justice
was
changed
into
a
and
as
on
the
previous
evening
the
sentinels
were
doubled
two
of
whom
guarded
the
door
of
the
closed
dungeon
toward
midnight
a
man
bearing
a
lantern
in
his
hand
crossed
the
where
he
made
himself
known
and
ordered
the
dungeon
to
be
opened
it
was
cimourdain
he
entered
leaving
the
door
half
open
behind
him
the
dungeon
was
dark
and
silent
taking
one
step
forward
in
the
gloom
he
placed
the
lantern
on
the
ground
and
stood
still
the
even
breathing
of
a
sleeping
man
could
be
heard
through
the
darkness
cimourdain
stood
dreamily
listening
to
this
peaceful
sound
on
the
truss
of
straw
at
the
farther
end
of
the
dungeon
lay
gauvain
sound
asleep
it
was
his
breathing
that
he
heard
cimourdain
moved
as
noiselessly
as
possible
and
when
he
had
drawn
near
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
gauvain
no
mother
gazing
upon
her
sleeping
infant
could
have
worn
a
look
more
unutterably
tender
the
expression
was
probably
beyond
his
control
he
pressed
his
clenched
hands
against
his
eyes
as
children
sometimes
do
and
for
a
moment
stood
perfectly
still
then
he
knelt
gently
lifted
gauvain
hand
and
carried
it
to
his
lips
gauvain
stirred
he
opened
his
eyes
with
the
vague
surprise
of
sudden
waking
the
feeble
glimmer
of
a
lantern
dimly
lighted
the
dungeon
he
recognized
cimourdain
ah
is
that
you
master
he
said
then
he
added
i
dreamed
that
death
was
kissing
my
hand
a
sudden
influx
of
thoughts
will
now
and
then
startle
a
man
and
so
it
was
with
cimourdain
at
times
this
wave
rolls
in
so
tumultuously
that
it
threatens
to
submerge
the
soul
but
cimourdain
deep
soul
gave
forth
no
sign
he
could
but
utter
the
word
gauvain
and
the
two
men
stood
gazing
at
each
other
cimourdain
eyes
alight
with
flames
that
scorched
his
tears
gauvain
with
his
sweetest
smile
gauvain
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
and
said
that
scar
i
see
on
your
face
is
the
you
received
in
my
stead
it
was
but
yesterday
you
stood
beside
me
in
the
mêlée
and
all
for
my
sake
if
providence
had
not
placed
you
by
my
cradle
where
should
i
be
in
ignorance
if
i
have
any
sense
of
duty
it
is
to
you
that
i
owe
it
i
was
born
in
fetters
i
mean
the
bonds
of
prejudice
which
you
have
loosened
you
promoted
my
free
development
and
from
the
mummy
you
have
created
a
child
you
have
implanted
a
conscience
in
a
being
who
bade
fair
to
prove
an
abortion
without
you
my
growth
would
have
been
cramped
it
is
through
your
influence
that
i
live
i
was
but
a
lord
you
have
made
of
me
a
citizen
i
was
only
a
citizen
you
have
made
of
me
a
mind
you
have
fitted
me
to
lead
the
life
of
a
man
upon
the
earth
and
have
shown
my
soul
the
way
to
heaven
it
is
you
who
placed
in
my
hands
the
key
of
truth
that
unlocks
the
domain
wherein
we
find
the
realities
of
human
life
and
the
key
of
light
to
the
realms
above
i
thank
you
my
master
to
you
i
owe
my
life
cimourdain
seating
himself
on
the
straw
beside
gauvain
said
i
have
come
to
sup
with
you
gauvain
broke
the
black
bread
and
offered
it
to
him
after
cimourdain
had
taken
a
piece
gauvain
handed
him
the
jug
of
water
drink
first
yourself
said
cimourdain
gauvain
drank
and
then
passed
the
jug
to
cimourdain
who
drank
after
him
gauvain
had
taken
but
a
swallow
cimourdain
took
deep
draughts
during
this
supper
gauvain
ate
and
cimourdain
drank
a
proof
of
the
calmness
of
the
one
and
of
the
burning
fever
of
the
other
a
certain
awful
tranquillity
pervaded
this
dungeon
the
two
men
conversed
gauvain
was
saying
grand
events
are
taking
form
no
one
can
comprehend
the
mysterious
workings
of
revolution
at
the
present
time
behind
the
visible
achievement
rests
the
invisible
the
one
concealing
the
other
the
visible
work
seems
cruel
the
invisible
is
sublime
at
this
moment
i
can
see
it
all
very
clearly
it
is
strange
and
beautiful
we
have
been
forced
to
use
the
materials
of
the
past
hence
this
wonderful
beneath
a
scaffolding
of
barbarism
we
are
building
the
temple
of
civilization
yes
replied
cimourdain
these
temporary
expedients
pave
the
way
for
the
final
adjustment
wherein
justice
and
duty
stand
side
by
side
where
taxation
will
be
proportionate
and
progressive
and
military
service
compulsory
where
there
is
to
be
absolute
equality
in
rank
and
where
above
all
things
else
the
straight
line
of
the
law
is
to
be
maintained
the
republic
of
the
absolute
i
prefer
the
republic
of
the
ideal
said
gauvain
he
broke
off
then
continued
but
oh
my
master
where
in
the
picture
you
have
just
drawn
in
words
do
you
place
devotion
sacrifice
abnegation
the
sweet
intermingling
of
kindliness
and
love
an
accurate
adjustment
of
proportions
is
a
good
thing
but
harmony
is
still
better
the
lyre
stands
higher
than
the
scales
your
republic
deals
with
the
material
interest
of
man
mine
transports
him
to
the
skies
it
is
like
the
difference
between
a
theorem
and
an
eagle
you
are
lost
in
the
clouds
and
you
in
your
calculations
there
is
an
element
of
dreaminess
in
harmony
so
there
is
in
algebra
i
would
have
man
fashioned
according
to
euclid
and
i
like
him
better
as
described
by
homer
the
stern
smile
of
cimourdain
rested
on
gauvain
as
though
to
stay
the
flight
of
his
soul
illustration
poetry
beware
of
poets
yes
that
is
a
familiar
warning
beware
zephyrs
beware
of
sunbeams
beware
of
perfumes
beware
of
flowers
beware
of
the
stars
that
sort
of
thing
can
never
supply
us
with
food
how
can
you
tell
there
is
mental
nourishment
a
man
finds
food
in
thought
let
us
indulge
in
no
abstractions
the
republic
is
like
two
and
two
in
mathematics
two
and
two
make
four
when
i
have
given
to
each
man
his
due
then
your
duty
is
to
give
him
what
does
not
revert
to
him
as
a
right
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
those
mutual
concessions
which
each
man
owes
his
neighbor
and
which
go
to
make
up
the
sum
of
social
life
there
is
nothing
beyond
the
just
limits
of
the
law
ah
but
there
is
everything
i
see
nothing
but
justice
i
look
higher
what
stands
higher
than
justice
equity
now
and
then
both
paused
as
though
a
sudden
light
had
flashed
across
their
minds
cimourdain
continued
explain
your
assertion
i
challenge
you
to
do
it
very
well
then
you
demand
compulsory
military
service
against
whom
against
mankind
i
object
to
military
service
i
would
have
peace
you
desire
to
help
the
wretched
what
i
wish
is
the
abolition
of
their
misery
you
demand
proportionate
taxation
i
would
have
no
taxes
whatsoever
i
would
have
the
public
expenses
reduced
to
the
lowest
level
and
paid
for
by
the
social
surplus
what
do
you
mean
by
that
this
in
the
first
place
it
is
for
you
to
suppress
sycophancy
that
of
the
priest
the
soldier
and
the
judge
then
use
your
wealth
to
the
best
advantage
distribute
over
your
furrows
all
that
fertilizing
matter
which
is
now
thrown
into
your
sewers
three
quarters
of
the
soil
lies
fallow
plough
it
up
redeem
the
waste
pastures
divide
the
communal
lands
let
each
man
have
a
farm
and
each
farm
a
man
you
will
increase
a
hundredfold
the
social
product
at
the
present
time
france
affords
her
peasants
meat
but
four
times
a
year
well
cultivated
she
could
feed
three
millions
of
men
all
europe
utilize
nature
that
gigantic
auxiliary
enlist
every
breeze
every
waterfall
every
magnetic
current
in
your
service
this
globe
has
a
subterranean
network
of
veins
through
which
flows
a
marvellous
circulation
of
water
oil
and
fire
pierce
this
vein
of
the
globe
and
let
the
water
feed
your
fountains
the
oil
your
lamps
and
the
fire
your
hearths
consider
the
action
of
the
waves
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tides
what
is
the
ocean
a
prodigious
force
wasted
how
stupid
is
the
earth
to
make
no
use
of
the
ocean
there
you
go
in
full
career
with
your
dreams
you
mean
with
my
realities
gauvain
continued
and
woman
how
do
you
dispose
of
her
cimourdain
replied
leave
her
as
she
is
the
servant
of
man
yes
under
one
condition
what
is
that
that
man
shall
be
the
servant
of
woman
what
are
you
thinking
of
exclaimed
cimourdain
man
a
servant
never
man
is
the
master
i
admit
but
one
kingdom
that
of
the
man
is
king
in
his
own
home
yes
on
one
condition
what
is
that
that
woman
shall
be
its
queen
you
mean
that
you
demand
for
both
man
and
woman
equality
can
you
dream
of
such
a
thing
the
two
beings
are
so
entirely
unlike
i
said
equality
not
identity
there
was
another
pause
a
sort
of
truce
as
it
were
between
these
two
minds
exchanging
their
lightning
flashes
cimourdain
broke
it
and
the
child
to
whose
care
would
you
intrust
that
first
to
the
father
who
begets
then
to
the
mother
who
gives
him
birth
later
to
the
master
who
educates
and
to
the
city
that
makes
a
man
of
him
then
to
the
country
which
is
his
supreme
mother
and
lastly
to
humanity
which
is
his
great
ancestress
you
have
not
mentioned
god
each
step
father
mother
master
city
country
humanity
is
but
a
rung
in
the
ladder
that
leads
to
god
cimourdain
was
silent
while
gauvain
continued
when
one
climbs
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
one
has
reached
god
god
is
revealed
and
one
has
but
to
enter
into
heaven
cimourdain
made
the
gesture
of
one
who
calls
another
back
gauvain
return
to
earth
we
want
to
realize
the
possible
do
not
begin
then
by
making
it
impossible
the
possible
may
always
be
realized
not
always
rough
usage
destroys
utopia
nothing
is
more
defenceless
than
the
egg
still
utopia
must
be
seized
and
forced
to
wear
the
yoke
of
reality
she
must
be
circumscribed
by
a
system
of
actual
facts
the
abstract
must
be
resolved
into
the
concrete
what
it
loses
in
beauty
it
gains
in
usefulness
although
contracted
it
is
improved
justice
must
enter
into
law
and
when
justice
has
become
law
it
is
absolute
that
is
what
i
call
the
possible
the
possible
includes
more
than
that
ah
there
you
go
again
soaring
away
into
the
land
of
dreams
the
possible
is
a
mysterious
bird
always
hovering
above
the
head
of
man
we
must
catch
it
and
take
it
alive
too
gauvain
continued
my
idea
is
this
ever
onward
if
god
had
intended
that
man
should
go
backwards
he
would
have
given
him
an
eye
in
the
back
of
his
head
let
us
look
always
towards
the
dawn
the
the
hour
of
birth
those
things
which
are
falling
to
decay
encourage
the
new
springing
life
in
the
splitting
of
the
old
tree
may
be
heard
a
summons
to
the
new
one
each
century
will
do
its
work
civic
humane
the
question
of
justice
that
of
compensation
wages
and
justice
are
in
point
of
fact
synonymous
terms
man
life
is
not
to
be
spent
without
a
suitable
compensation
when
he
bestows
life
god
contracts
thereby
a
debt
justice
is
the
inherent
compensation
remuneration
is
the
acquirement
thereof
gauvain
spoke
with
the
calm
serenity
of
a
prophet
cimourdain
listened
the
parts
were
changed
and
now
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
the
pupil
who
had
become
the
master
cimourdain
murmured
you
go
at
a
rapid
rate
perhaps
because
i
have
no
time
to
lose
replied
gauvain
with
a
smile
he
continued
ah
master
here
is
the
difference
between
our
two
utopias
you
would
have
military
service
obligatory
i
demand
the
same
for
education
you
dream
of
man
the
soldier
i
of
man
the
citizen
you
wish
him
to
strike
terror
i
would
have
him
thoughtful
you
establish
a
republic
of
swords
while
i
desire
to
found
he
broke
off
i
should
like
to
establish
a
republic
of
minds
cimourdain
looked
down
on
the
of
the
dungeon
and
in
the
mean
time
what
would
you
have
he
asked
the
existing
condition
of
things
then
you
absolve
the
present
moment
yes
why
because
it
is
a
tempest
a
tempest
always
knows
what
it
is
about
for
every
oak
that
is
struck
by
lightning
how
many
forests
are
purified
civilization
has
a
plague
a
strong
wind
is
sent
to
expel
it
from
the
land
it
may
not
choose
its
methods
wisely
perhaps
but
can
it
do
otherwise
its
task
is
no
light
one
viewing
the
horror
of
the
miasma
i
can
understand
the
fury
of
the
wind
gauvain
went
on
but
what
matters
the
storm
to
me
if
i
have
a
compass
and
what
power
can
events
gain
over
me
if
i
have
my
conscience
and
he
added
in
that
undertone
which
produces
so
solemn
an
effect
there
is
one
to
whose
will
we
must
always
yield
who
is
that
asked
cimourdain
gauvain
pointed
upwards
cimourdain
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
uplifted
finger
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
see
the
starry
sky
through
the
dungeon
vault
once
more
they
relapsed
into
silence
cimourdain
continued
a
supernatural
state
of
society
i
tell
you
it
is
no
longer
possible
it
is
a
mere
dream
it
is
a
goal
otherwise
of
what
use
is
society
better
remain
in
a
state
of
nature
be
like
the
savages
otaheite
is
a
paradise
only
in
that
paradise
no
one
thinks
better
an
intelligent
hell
than
a
stupid
heaven
but
no
we
will
have
no
hell
whatever
let
us
be
a
human
society
yes
but
if
you
are
to
add
nothing
to
nature
why
leave
her
in
that
case
you
may
as
well
content
yourself
with
work
like
the
ant
and
with
honey
like
the
bee
rest
content
among
the
laboring
classes
instead
of
rising
to
the
ranks
of
superior
intelligence
if
you
add
anything
to
nature
you
must
of
necessity
rise
above
her
to
add
is
to
augment
to
augment
is
to
increase
society
is
the
exaltation
of
nature
i
would
have
what
and
lack
monuments
arts
poetry
heroes
men
of
genius
to
bear
eternal
burdens
is
no
fit

he
said
no

the
door
had
remained
open
sounds
from
without
penetrated
into
the
dungeon
the
distant
echo
of
a
trumpet
reached
their
ears
probably
the
réveille
then
when
the
guard
was
relieved
they
heard
the
of
the
sentinels
muskets
striking
the
ground
again
apparently
quite
near
the
tower
so
far
as
the
darkness
allowed
one
to
judge
a
noise
like
the
moving
of
planks
and
beams
accompanied
by
muffled
and
intermittent
sounds
resembling
the
blows
of
a
hammer
cimourdain
turned
pale
as
he
listened
gauvain
heard
nothing
deeper
and
deeper
grew
his
reverie
hardly
did
he
seem
to
breathe
so
absorbed
was
he
in
the
visions
of
his
brain
now
and
then
he
moved
like
one
slightly
startled
a
gathering
brightness
shone
in
his
eyes
like
the
light
of
dawn
some
time
passed
thus
of
what
are
you
thinking
asked
cimourdain
of
the
future
replied
gauvain
and
he
fell
back
again
into
his
meditation
unobserved
by
the
latter
cimourdain
rose
from
the
bed
of
straw
whereon
they
had
both
been
sitting
his
eyes
rested
yearningly
upon
the
young
dreamer
while
he
slowly
moved
backward
towards
the
door
he
went
out
the
dungeon
was
again
closed
illustration
vi
still
the
sun
rises
it
was
not
long
before
day
began
to
dawn
on
the
horizon
and
together
with
the
day
there
sprang
to
light
upon
the
plateau
of
the
tourgue
above
the
forest
of
fougères
a
strange
stationary
and
wonderful
object
unfamiliar
to
the
birds
of
heaven
it
had
been
placed
there
during
the
night
set
up
rather
than
built
from
a
distance
against
the
horizon
it
presented
a
profile
composed
of
straight
and
rigid
lines
resembling
a
hebrew
letter
or
one
of
those
egyptian
hieroglyphics
which
formed
part
of
the
alphabet
of
the
ancient
enigma
the
first
thought
that
entered
the
mind
at
the
sight
of
this
object
was
its
uselessness
there
it
stood
among
the
blossoming
heather
then
came
the
question
could
it
be
used
and
for
what
purpose
then
came
a
shudder
it
was
a
sort
of
supported
by
four
posts
at
one
end
were
two
long
upright
beams
united
at
the
top
by
a
from
which
hung
a
triangle
that
looked
black
against
the
pale
blue
of
the
morning
sky
at
the
other
end
of
this
trestle
stood
a
ladder
between
these
two
beams
beneath
the
triangle
could
be
distinguished
a
sort
of
panel
composed
of
two
movable
sections
which
fitting
into
one
another
offered
to
the
eye
a
round
hole
about
the
size
of
a
neck
the
upper
section
of
the
panel
ran
in
a
groove
by
means
of
which
it
could
be
raised
or
lowered
for
the
moment
the
two
semicircles
that
formed
the
collar
were
drawn
apart
at
the
foot
of
the
two
pillars
supporting
the
triangle
was
seen
a
plank
that
moved
on
hinges
like
a
beside
the
plank
stood
a
long
basket
and
in
front
between
the
two
posts
at
the
end
of
the
staging
a
square
one
this
object
was
painted
red
and
made
entirely
of
wood
except
the
triangle
which
was
of
iron
one
might
know
that
it
was
built
by
men
so
ugly
sordid
and
contemptible
did
it
look
and
yet
so
formidable
was
it
that
it
might
well
have
been
transported
hither
by
genii
this
shapeless
structure
was
the
guillotine
in
front
of
it
a
few
paces
off
in
the
ravine
was
another
monster
la
tourgue
a
stone
monster
to
the
monster
of
wood
and
let
us
add
that
after
wood
and
stone
have
been
manipulated
by
man
they
lose
something
of
their
original
substance
taking
on
a
certain
similitude
to
man
himself
a
building
is
a
dogma
a
machine
is
an
idea
the
tourgue
was
that
fatal
product
of
the
past
called
in
paris
the
bastille
in
england
the
tower
of
london
in
germany
the
fortress
of
spielberg
in
spain
the
escurial
in
moscow
the
kremlin
and
in
rome
the
castle
of
the
tourgue
was
the
condensation
of
fifteen
hundred
years
the
period
of
the
middle
ages
with
its
vassalage
its
servitude
and
its
feudality
the
guillotine
showed
forth
but
one
year
but
these
twelve
months
were
a
fitting
counterpoise
for
those
fifteen
centuries
the
tourgue
was
the
personification
of
monarchy
the
guillotine
of
revolution
a
tragic
encounter
on
the
one
hand
the
debt
on
the
other
the
requirement
thereof
all
the
hopeless
entanglement
of
the
gothic
period
the
serf
the
lord
the
slave
the
master
the
plebeian
the
nobility
a
complex
code
with
all
the
ramifications
of
practice
the
coalition
of
judge
and
priest
the
infinite
variety
of
shackles
fiscal
duties
the
the
mortmain
the
the
exception
the
prerogatives
the
prejudices
the
fanaticisms
the
royal
privilege
of
bankruptcy
the
sceptre
the
throne
the
arbitrary
will
the
divine
right
opposed
to
that
simple
thing
a
knife
on
one
side
a
knot
on
the
other
the
axe
for
many
a
year
the
tourgue
had
stood
alone
in
this
desert
and
from
its
battlements
had
rained
the
boiling
oil
the
burning
pitch
and
the
melted
lead
there
it
stood
with
its
dungeons
paved
with
human
bones
its
alive
with
memories
of
its
tragic
past
for
fifteen
centuries
of
savage
tranquillity
its
gloomy
front
had
towered
above
the
shades
of
the
forest
it
had
been
the
only
power
in
the
land
the
one
thing
respected
and
feared
its
reign
had
been
supreme
without
a
rival
in
its
wild
barbarity
when
it
suddenly
saw
rising
before
it
with
an
aspect
of
hostility
a
thing
nay
more
than
a
thing
a
creature
as
hideous
as
itself
the
guillotine
stone
seems
at
times
endowed
with
the
sense
of
sight
a
statue
observes
a
tower
watches
the
front
of
a
building
contemplates
the
tourgue
seemed
to
be
examining
the
guillotine
it
was
as
if
questioning
itself
what
can
this
object
be
one
might
fancy
it
to
have
sprung
from
the
soil
and
so
indeed
it
had
like
a
poisonous
tree
it
had
sprouted
from
a
fatal
soil
from
that
soil
so
plentifully
watered
by
human
sweat
by
tears
and
by
blood
from
the
soil
wherein
men
had
dug
countless
graves
tombs
caves
and
ambushes
from
the
same
soil
wherein
had
rotted
the
innumerable
victims
of
every
kind
of
tyranny
from
that
soil
covering
so
great
a
multitude
of
crimes
buried
like
frightful
germs
in
the
depths
below
had
sprung
forth
on
the
appointed
day
this
stranger
this
avenging
goddess
this
fierce
instrument
and
cried
out
to
the
old
world
behold
me
the
guillotine
had
a
right
to
say
to
the
dungeon
i
am
thy
daughter
and
yet
at
the
same
time
the
keep
for
these
fatal
objects
live
a
certain
obscure
life
recognized
its
own
at
the
sight
of
this
formidable
apparition
the
tourgue
seemed
bewildered
one
might
have
called
it
terror
the
immense
mass
of
granite
was
both
majestic
and
infamous
that
plank
with
its
triangle
was
still
more
dreadful
deposed
omnipotence
felt
a
horror
of
the
rising
power
it
was
criminal
history
studying
judicial
history
the
violence
of
former
days
was
comparing
itself
with
the
violence
of
the
present
time
the
ancient
fortress
both
the
prison
and
the
dwelling
of
the
lords
where
the
tortured
victims
had
shrieked
aloud
this
structure
devoted
to
war
and
murder
now
useless
and
defenceless
violated
dismantled
discrowned
a
pile
of
stones
no
better
than
a
heap
of
cinders
hideous
to
look
upon
magnificent
in
death
dizzy
with
the
vertigo
of
those
terrible
centuries
stood
watching
the
passage
of
the
awful
living
hour
yesterday
shuddered
in
the
presence
of
the
old
ferocity
beheld
and
did
homage
to
the
new
terror
and
that
which
was
mere
nothingness
unclosed
its
spectral
eyes
before
the
terror
and
the
phantom
gazed
upon
the
ghost
nature
is
pitiless
she
never
withholds
her
flowers
her
melodies
her
perfumes
her
sunbeams
from
human
abominations
she
overwhelms
man
by
the
contrast
between
divine
beauty
and
social
ugliness
she
spares
him
nothing
neither
the
wing
of
butterfly
nor
song
of
bird
on
the
verge
of
murder
in
the
act
of
vengeance
or
barbarity
she
brings
him
face
to
face
with
those
holy
things
nowhere
can
he
escape
the
eternal
reproach
of
universal
benevolence
and
the
implacable
serenity
of
the
sky
human
law
in
all
its
hideous
deformity
must
stand
forth
naked
in
the
presence
of
the
eternal
radiance
man
breaks
and
crushes
lays
waste
destroys
but
the
summer
the
lily
and
the
star
remain
ever
the
same
never
had
the
fair
sky
of
early
dawn
seemed
lovelier
than
on
that
morning
a
soft
breeze
stirred
the
heather
the
mist
floated
lightly
among
the
branches
the
forest
of
fougères
suffused
with
the
breath
of
running
brooks
smoked
in
the
dawn
like
a
gigantic
censer
filled
with
incense
the
blue
sky
the
snowy
clouds
the
clear
transparency
of
the
streams
the
verdure
with
its
harmonious
scale
of
color
from
the
to
the
emerald
the
social
groups
of
trees
the
grassy
glades
the
plains
all
revealed
that
purity
which
is
nature
eternal
precept
unto
man
in
the
midst
of
all
this
appeared
the
awful
depravity
of
man
there
stood
the
fortress
and
the
scaffold
war
and
punishment
the
two
representatives
of
this
sanguinary
epoch
and
moment
the
of
the
gloomy
night
of
the
past
and
the
bat
of
the
twilight
of
the
future
in
the
presence
of
a
world
all
flowery
and
fragrant
tender
and
charming
the
glorious
sky
bathed
both
the
tourgue
and
the
guillotine
with
the
light
of
dawn
as
though
it
said
to
man
behold
my
work
and
yours
the
sun
wields
a
formidable
weapon
in
its
light
this
spectacle
had
its
spectators
the
four
thousand
men
of
the
expeditionary
army
were
drawn
up
on
the
plateau
in
battle
array
they
surrounded
the
guillotine
on
three
sides
forming
themselves
around
it
after
a
geometrical
fashion
in
the
shape
of
the
letter
e
the
battery
placed
against
the
centre
of
the
longest
line
made
the
notch
of
the
the
red
machine
was
if
we
may
so
express
it
shut
in
by
these
three
battle
fronts
a
wall
of
soldiers
extending
in
a
sort
of
coil
and
spreading
as
far
as
the
edge
of
the
escarpment
of
the
plateau
the
fourth
side
left
open
was
the
ravine
itself
which
looked
upon
the
tourgue
this
formed
an
oblong
square
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
the
scaffold
the
shadow
cast
upon
the
grass
by
the
guillotine
lessened
as
the
sun
rose
the
gunners
with
lighted
matches
stood
by
their
pieces
a
faint
blue
smoke
curled
upward
from
the
ravine
the
last
breath
of
the
dying
fire
on
the
bridge
this
smoke
obscured
without
veiling
the
tourgue
whose
lofty
platform
overlooked
the
entire
horizon
only
the
width
of
the
ravine
separated
the
platform
from
the
guillotine
and
voices
could
easily
have
been
heard
between
them
the
table
of
the
tribunal
and
the
chair
shaded
by
the
tricolored
flags
had
been
conveyed
to
this
platform
the
sun
rising
behind
the
tourgue
brought
into
relief
the
black
mass
of
the
fortress
and
upon
its
summit
seated
on
the
chair
of
the
tribunal
beneath
the
group
of
flags
the
figure
of
a
man
motionless
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
this
man
was
cimourdain
he
wore
as
on
the
previous
evening
his
civil
delegate
uniform
a
hat
with
the
tricolored
cockade
upon
his
head
a
sabre
by
his
side
and
pistols
in
his
belt
he
was
silent
the
entire
assembly
was
silent
likewise
the
soldiers
their
eyes
downcast
stood
at
they
touched
elbows
but
no
one
spoke
they
were
thinking
vaguely
about
this
war
the
numerous
battles
the
hedge
fusillades
so
valiantly
faced
of
the
hosts
of
furious
peasants
scattered
by
their
prowess
the
citadels
conquered
the
engagements
won
the
victories
and
now
it
seemed
as
though
all
this
glory
were
turned
to
their
shame
a
gloomy
expectation
oppressed
every
breast
they
could
see
the
executioner
walking
up
and
down
the
platform
of
the
guillotine
the
growing
light
of
day
deepened
until
it
filled
the
sky
with
its
majestic
presence
suddenly
was
heard
that
muffled
sound
peculiar
to
drums
nearer
and
nearer
came
their
funereal
roll
the
ranks
opened
and
the
procession
entering
the
square
moved
towards
the
scaffold
first
came
the
black
drums
then
a
company
of
grenadiers
with
lowered
muskets
then
a
platoon
of
gendarmes
with
drawn
sabres
then
the
prisoner
gauvain
gauvain
walked
without
constraint
neither
hands
nor
feet
were
bound
he
was
in
undress
uniform
and
wore
his
sword
behind
him
marched
another
platoon
of
gendarmes
the
same
pensive
joy
that
had
lighted
his
face
when
he
said
to
cimourdain
i
am
thinking
of
the
future
still
rested
upon
it
nothing
could
be
more
sublime
and
touching
than
this
continued
smile
when
he
reached
the
fatal
spot
his
first
glance
was
turned
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
he
disdained
the
guillotine
he
knew
that
cimourdain
would
feel
it
his
duty
to
be
present
at
the
execution
his
eyes
sought
him
on
the
platform
and
found
him
there
cimourdain
was
ghastly
pale
and
cold
even
those
who
stood
nearest
heard
no
sound
of
his
breathing
when
he
caught
sight
of
gauvain
not
a
quiver
passed
over
his
face
and
yet
he
knew
that
every
step
brought
him
nearer
to
the
scaffold
as
he
advanced
gauvain
looked
at
cimourdain
and
cimourdain
looked
at
him
it
seemed
as
though
cimourdain
found
support
in
that
glance
gauvain
reached
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
he
ascended
it
followed
by
the
officer
in
command
of
the
grenadiers
he
unbelted
his
sword
and
handed
it
to
this
officer
then
he
loosened
his
cravat
and
gave
it
to
the
headsman
he
was
like
a
vision
never
had
he
looked
more
beautiful
his
brown
locks
floated
in
the
wind
at
that
time
they
did
not
cut
the
hair
of
those
about
to
be
executed
his
fair
throat
reminded
one
of
a
woman
his
heroic
and
commanding
expression
gave
the
idea
of
an
he
stood
upon
the
scaffold
lost
in
reverie
there
too
was
a
height
gauvain
stood
upon
it
stately
and
calm
the
sun
streamed
about
him
crowning
him
as
it
were
with
a
halo
still
the
prisoner
must
be
bound
rope
in
hand
the
executioner
advanced
at
that
moment
when
the
soldiers
saw
their
young
leader
so
near
the
knife
they
could
no
longer
restrain
themselves
the
hearts
of
those
warriors
burst
forth
then
was
heard
a
startling
sound
the
sobs
of
an
entire
army
a
clamor
arose
mercy
mercy
some
fell
on
their
knees
others
threw
down
their
muskets
stretching
their
arms
towards
the
platform
where
cimourdain
stood
one
grenadier
pointing
to
the
guillotine
cried
here
i
am
will
you
not
take
me
as
a
substitute
all
repeated
frantically
mercy
mercy
the
very
lions
would
have
been
moved
or
terrified
for
the
tears
of
soldiers
are
terrible
the
headsman
paused
uncertain
what
to
do
then
a
voice
quick
and
low
and
yet
in
its
ominous
severity
distinctly
heard
by
all
cried
from
the
top
of
the
tower
execute
the
law
they
recognized
the
inexorable
tone
cimourdain
had
spoken
the
army
shuddered
the
executioner
hesitated
no
longer
he
moved
forward
holding
out
the
cord
wait
said
gauvain
and
turning
towards
cimourdain
he
waved
his
free
right
hand
in
token
of
farewell
then
he
allowed
himself
to
be
bound
when
he
was
tied
he
said
to
the
executioner
pardon
one
moment
more
long
live
the
republic
he
cried
he
was
laid
upon
the
plank
the
infamous
collar
clasped
that
charming
and
noble
head
the
executioner
gently
lifted
his
hair
then
pressed
the
spring
the
triangle
detached
itself
gliding
first
slowly
then
rapidly
a
frightful
blow
was
heard
at
the
same
instant
another
report
sounded
the
stroke
of
the
axe
was
answered
by
a
cimourdain
had
just
seized
one
of
the
pistols
that
he
wore
in
his
belt
and
as
gauvain
head
rolled
into
the
basket
cimourdain
sent
a
bullet
through
his
own
heart
a
stream
of
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
and
he
fell
dead
thus
these
twin
souls
united
in
the
tragic
death
rose
together
the
shadow
of
the
one
blending
with
the
radiance
of
the
other
