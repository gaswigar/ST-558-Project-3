by

dedication
to
the
other
man
mr
philip
kershaw
were
once
two
men
they
were
men
of
might
and
breeding
they
were
young
they
were
intolerant
they
were
hale
were
there
for
humans
as
there
is
for
dogs
a
tribunal
to
determine
excellence
were
there
judges
of
anthropoidal
points
and
juries
to
give
prizes
for
manly
race
vigour
and
the
rest
undoubtedly
these
two
men
would
have
gained
the
gold
and
the
pewter
medals
they
were
men
loved
each
other
like
brothers
yet
they
quarrelled
like
socialists
they
loved
each
other
because
they
had
in
common
the
bond
of
mankind
they
quarrelled
because
they
differed
upon
nearly
all
other
things
the
one
was
of
the
faith
the
other
most
certainly
was
not
the
one
sang
loudly
the
other
sweetly
the
one
was
stronger
the
other
more
cunning
the
one
rode
horses
with
a
long
stirrup
the
other
with
a
short
the
one
was
indifferent
to
danger
the
other
forced
himself
at
it
the
one
could
write
verse
the
other
was
quite
incapable
thereof
the
one
could
read
and
quote
theocritus
the
other
read
and
quoted
himself
alone
the
high
gods
had
given
to
one
judgment
to
the
other
valour
but
to
both
that
measure
of
misfortune
which
is
their
gift
to
those
whom
they
this
last
proceeded
in
them
both
a
great
knowledge
of
truth
and
a
defence
of
it
to
the
tedium
of
their
friends
a
demotion
to
the
beauty
of
women
and
of
this
world
an
outspoken
hatred
of
certain
things
and
men
and
alas
a
permanent
sadness
also
all
these
things
the
gods
gave
them
in
the
day
when
the
decision
was
taken
upon
olympus
that
these
two
men
should
not
profit
by
any
great
good
except
friendship
and
that
all
their
lives
through
necessity
should
jerk
her
bit
between
their
teeth
and
even
at
moments
goad
their
high
gods
which
are
names
only
to
the
multitude
visited
these
men
dionysus
came
to
them
with
all
his
company
once
at
dawn
upon
the
surrey
hills
and
drove
them
in
his
car
from
a
suburb
whose
name
i
forget
right
out
into
the
weald
pallas
athene
taught
them
by
word
of
mouth
and
the
cytherean
was
their
rosy
warm
unfailing
friend
apollo
loved
them
he
bestowed
upon
them
under
his
own
hand
the
power
not
only
of
remembering
all
songs
but
even
of
composing
light
airs
of
their
own
and
pan
who
is
hairy
by
nature
and
a
lurking
fellow
afraid
of
others
was
reconciled
to
their
easy
comradeship
and
would
accompany
them
into
the
mountains
when
they
were
remote
from
mankind
upon
these
occasions
he
revealed
to
them
the
life
of
trees
and
the
spirits
that
haunt
the
cataracts
so
that
they
heard
voices
calling
where
no
one
else
had
ever
heard
them
and
that
they
saw
stones
turned
into
animals
and
things
came
to
them
in
common
once
in
the
hills
a
thousand
miles
from
home
when
they
had
not
seen
men
for
a
very
long
time
dalua
touched
them
with
his
wing
and
they
went
mad
for
the
space
of
thirty
hours
it
was
by
a
stream
in
a
profound
gorge
at
evening
and
under
a
fretful
moon
the
next
morning
they
lustrated
themselves
with
water
and
immediately
they
were
another
time
they
took
a
rotten
old
leaky
boat
they
were
poor
and
could
afford
no
other
they
took
i
say
a
rotten
old
leaky
boat
whose
tiller
was
loose
and
whose
sails
mouldy
and
whose
blocks
were
jammed
and
creaking
and
whose
rigging
frayed
and
they
boldly
set
out
together
into
the
great
north
blew
a
capful
it
blew
half
a
gale
it
blew
a
gale
little
they
cared
these
sons
of
ares
these
cousins
of
the
broad
daylight
there
mere
no
men
on
earth
save
these
two
who
would
not
have
got
her
under
a
trysail
and
a
rag
of
a
with
fifteen
reefs
and
another
not
so
the
heroes
not
a
stitch
would
they
take
in
they
carried
all
her
canvas
and
cried
out
to
the
wind
we
know
her
better
than
you
she
carry
away
before
she
capsizes
and
she
burst
long
before
she
carry
away
so
they
ran
before
it
largely
till
the
bows
were
pressed
right
under
and
it
was
no
human
poser
that
saved
the
gybe
they
went
tearing
and
foaming
before
it
singing
a
saga
as
befitted
the
place
and
time
for
it
was
their
habit
to
sing
in
every
place
its
proper
song
in
italy
a
ritornella
in
spain
a
segeduilla
in
provence
a
pastourou
in
sussex
a
glee
but
an
the
great
north
sea
a
saga
and
they
rolled
at
last
into
orford
haven
on
the
very
tiptop
of
the
highest
tide
that
ever
has
run
since
the
noachic
deluge
and
even
so
as
they
crossed
the
bar
they
heard
the
grating
of
the
keel
that
night
they
sacrificed
oysters
to
when
they
slept
the
sea
lady
the
one
came
up
through
the
waves
and
kissed
them
in
their
sleep
for
she
had
seen
no
such
men
since
achilles
then
she
went
back
through
the
waves
with
all
her
nereids
around
her
to
where
her
throne
is
beside
her
old
father
in
the
depths
of
the
their
errantry
they
did
great
good
it
was
they
that
rescued
andromeda
though
she
lied
as
a
woman
will
and
gave
the
praise
to
her
lover
it
was
they
also
who
slew
the
tarasque
on
his
second
appearance
when
he
came
in
a
thunderstorm
across
the
broad
bridge
of
beaucaire
all
scaled
in
crimson
and
gold
forty
foot
long
and
twenty
foot
high
galloping
like
an
angry
dog
and
belching
forth
flames
and
smoke
they
also
hunted
down
the
bactrian
bear
who
had
claws
like
the
horns
of
a
cow
and
of
whom
it
is
written
in
the
sacred
books
of
the
east
that
bear
out
of
bactria
came
and
he
wandered
all
over
the
world
and
his
eyes
were
aglint
and
aflame
and
the
tip
of
his
caudal
was
they
hunted
him
down
and
they
cut
him
up
and
they
cured
one
of
his
hams
and
ate
it
thereby
acquiring
something
of
his
mighty
spirit
and
they
it
was
who
caught
the
great
devil
of
dax
and
tied
him
up
and
swinged
him
with
an
till
he
swore
that
he
would
haunt
the
woods
no
here
it
is
that
you
ask
me
for
their
names
their
names
their
names
why
they
gave
themselves
a
hundred
names
now
this
now
that
but
always
names
of
power
thus
upon
that
great
march
of
theirs
from
gascony
into
navarre
one
on
the
crest
of
the
mountains
cut
himself
a
huge
staff
and
cried
loudly
my
name
is
ursus
and
this
is
my
staff
dreadnought
let
the
people
in
the
valley
be
afraid
the
other
cut
himself
a
yet
huger
staff
and
cried
out
in
a
yet
louder
voice
my
name
is
taurus
and
this
is
my
staff
let
them
tremble
who
live
in
the
dales
when
they
had
said
this
they
strode
shouting
down
the
and
conquered
the
town
of
elizondo
where
they
are
worshipped
as
gods
to
this
day
their
names
they
gave
themselves
a
hundred
names
well
well
you
say
to
me
then
no
matter
about
the
names
what
are
names
the
men
themselves
concern
me
tell
me
you
go
on
tell
me
where
i
am
to
find
them
in
the
flesh
and
converse
with
them
i
am
in
haste
to
see
them
with
my
own
eyes
is
useless
to
ask
they
are
dead
they
will
never
again
be
heard
upon
the
heaths
at
morning
singing
their
happy
songs
they
will
never
more
drink
with
their
peers
in
the
deep
of
home
they
are
perished
they
have
disappeared
alas
the
valiant
fellows
lest
some
list
of
their
proud
deeds
and
notable
excursions
should
be
lost
on
earth
and
turn
perhaps
into
legend
or
what
is
worse
fade
away
unrecorded
this
book
has
been
got
together
in
which
will
be
found
now
a
sight
they
saw
together
and
now
a
sight
one
saw
by
himself
and
now
a
sight
seen
only
by
the
other
as
also
certain
thoughts
and
admirations
which
the
second
or
the
first
enjoyed
or
both
together
and
indeed
many
other
towns
seas
places
mountains
rivers
and
men
whatever
could
be
crammed
between
the
there
is
an
end
of
many
of
these
pages
have
appeared
in
the

post
the
daily
news
the
pall
mall
magazine
the
evening
standard
the
morning
leader
and
the
westminster
gazette
the
north
sea
it
was
on
or
about
a
tuesday
i
speak
without
boasting
that
my
companion
and
i
crept
in
by
darkness
to
the
unpleasant
harbour
of
lowestoft
and
i
say
unpleasant
because
however
charming
for
the
large
colonial
yacht
it
is
the
very
devil
for
the
little
english
craft
that
tries
to
lie
there
great
boats
are
moored
in
the
southern
basin
each
with
two
head
ropes
to
a
buoy
so
that
the
front
of
them
makes
a
kind
of
entanglement
such
as
is
used
to
defend
the
front
of
a
position
in
warfare
through
this
entanglement
you
are
told
to
creep
as
best
you
can
and
if
you
can
not
who
could
a
man
comes
off
in
a
boat
and
moors
you
not
head
and
stern
but
as
it
were
or
so
that
you
are
really
foul
of
the
next
berth
alongside
and
that
in
our
case
was
a
little
steamer
then
when
you
protest
that
there
may
be
a
collision
at
midnight
the
man
in
the
boat
says
merrily
oh
the
wind
will
keep
you
off
as
though
winds
never
changed
or
dropped
i
should
like
to
see
moorings
done
that
way
at
cowes
say
or
in
southampton
water
i
should
like
to
see
a
lot
of
craft
laid
head
and
tail
to
the
wind
with
a
yard
between
each
and
when
lord
isaacs
protested
i
should
like
to
hear
the
harbour
man
say
in
a
distant
voice
volo
sic
a
classical
quotation
misquoted
as
in
the
way
the
wind
never
changes
here
such
as
it
was
there
it
was
and
trusting
in
the
wind
and
providence
we
lay
in
lowestoft
south
basin
the
great
bear
shuffled
round
the
pole
and
streaks
of
wispy
clouds
lay
out
in
heaven
the
next
morning
there
was
a
jolly
great
breeze
from
the
east
and
my
companion
said
let
us
put
out
to
sea
but
before
i
go
further
let
me
explain
to
you
and
to
the
whole
world
what
vast
courage
and
meaning
underlay
these
simple
words
in
what
were
we
to
put
to
sea
this
little
boat
was
but
feet
over
all
she
had
lived
since
in
inland
waters
mousing
about
rivers
and
lying
comfortably
in
mudbanks
she
had
a
sprit
seventeen
foot
outboard
and
i
appeal
to
the
trinity
brothers
to
explain
what
that
means
a
sprit
dangerous
and
horrible
where
there
are
waves
a
sprit
that
will
catch
every
sea
and
wet
the
foot
of
your
jib
in
the
best
of
weathers
a
sprit
that
weighs
down
already
overweighted
bows
and
buries
them
with
every
plunge
dicam
a
sprit
of
erebus
and
why
had
the
boat
such
a
sprit
because
her
mast
was
so
far
aft
her
forefoot
so
deep
and
narrow
her
helm
so
insufficient
that
but
for
this
gigantic
sprit
she
would
never
come
round
and
even
as
it
was
she
hung
in
stays
and
had
to
have
her
weather
hauled
in
for
about
five
minutes
before
she
would
come
round
so
much
for
the
sprit
this
is
not
all
nor
nearly
all
she
had
about
six
inches
of
she
did
not
rise
at
the
bows
not
she
her
mast
was
dependent
upon
a
forestay
spliced
and
was
not
stepped
but
worked
in
a
tabernacle
she
was
a
hundred
and
two
years
old
her
counter
was
all
but
awash
her
helm
i
will
describe
her
helm
it
waggled
back
and
forth
without
effect
unless
you
jerked
it
suddenly
over
then
it
bit
as
it
were
into
the
rudder
post
and
she
just
felt
it
but
only
just
the
ronyon
she
did
not
reef
as
you
and
i
do
by
sane
reefing
points
but
in
a
gimcrack
fashion
with
a
long
lace
so
that
it
took
half
an
hour
to
take
in
sail
she
had
not
a
jib
and
foresail
but
just
one
big
headsail
as
high
as
the
peak
and
if
one
wanted
to
shorten
sail
after
the
enormous
labour
of
reefing
the
mainsail
which
no
man
could
do
alone
one
had
to
change
jibs
forward
and
put
up
a
storm
sail
under
which
by
the
way
she
was
harder
to
put
round
than
ever
did
she
leak
no
i
think
not
it
is
a
pious
opinion
i
think
she
was
tight
under
the
composition
but
above
that
and
between
wind
and
water
she
positively
showed
daylight
she
was
a
basket
glory
be
to
god
that
such
a
boat
should
swim
at
all
but
she
drew
little
water
the
devil
she
did
there
was
a
legend
in
the
yard
where
she
was
built
that
she
drew
five
feet
four
but
on
a
close
examination
of
her
on
the
third
time
she
was
wrecked
i
calculated
with
my
companion
that
she
drew
little
if
anything
under
six
feet
all
this
i
say
knowing
well
that
i
shall
soon
put
her
up
for
sale
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
shall
not
divulge
her
name
so
we
put
to
sea
intending
to
run
to
harwich
there
was
a
strong
flood
down
the
coast
and
the
wind
was
to
the
north
of
but
the
wind
was
with
the
tide
to
that
you
owe
the
lives
of
the
two
men
and
the
lection
of
this
delightful
story
for
had
the
tide
been
against
the
wind
and
the
water
steep
and
mutinous
you
would
never
have
seen
either
of
us
again
indeed
we
should
have
trembled
out
of
sight
for
ever
the
wind
was
with
the
tide
and
in
a
following
lump
of
a
sea
without
combers
and
with
a
rising
glass
we
valorously
set
out
and
missing
the
south
pier
by
four
inches
we
occupied
the
deep
for
one
short
things
went
more
or
less
well
i
noted
a
white
horse
or
two
to
windward
but
my
companion
said
it
was
only
the
sea
breaking
over
the
outer
sands
she
plunged
a
lot
but
i
flattered
myself
she
was
carrying
caesar
and
thought
it
no
great
harm
we
had
started
without
food
meaning
to
cook
a
breakfast
when
we
were
well
outside
but
men
plans
are
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
the
god
called
æolus
that
blows
from
the
of
the
world
you
may
see
him
on
old
maps
it
is
a
pity
they
do
put
him
on
the
modern
said
to
his
friends
i
see
a
little
boat
it
is
long
since
i
sank
one
and
altogether
they
gave
chase
like
imperialists
to
destroy
what
was
infinitely
weak
i
looked
to
windward
and
saw
the
sea
tumbling
and
a
great
number
of
white
waves
my
heart
was
still
so
high
that
i
gave
them
the
names
of
the
waves
in
the
eighteenth
the
wave
the
graceful
wave
the
wave
that
breaks
on
an
island
a
long
way
off
the
sandy
wave
the
wave
before
us
the
wave
that
brings
good
tidings
but
they
were
in
no
mood
for
poetry
they
began
to
be
great
angry
roaring
waves
like
the
chiefs
of
charging
clans
and
though
i
tried
to
keep
up
my
courage
with
an
excellent
song
by
newbolt
slung
between
the
round
shot
in
nombre
dios
bay
i
soon
found
it
useless
and
pinned
my
soul
to
the
tiller
every
sea
following
caught
my
helm
and
battered
it
i
hung
on
like
a
stout
gentleman
and
prayed
to
the
seven
gods
of
the
land
my
companion
said
things
were
no
worse
than
when
we
started
god
forgive
him
the
courageous
lie
the
wind
and
the
sea
rose
it
was
about
opposite
southwold
that
the
danger
became
intolerable
and
that
i
thought
it
could
only
end
one
way
which
way
the
way
out
my
honest
jingoes
which
you
are
more
afraid
of
than
of
anything
else
in
the
world
we
ran
before
it
we
were
already
and
she
buried
her
nose
every
time
so
that
i
feared
i
should
next
be
cold
in
the
water
seeing
england
from
the
top
of
a
wave
every
time
she
rose
the
jib
let
out
a
hundredweight
of
the
sprit
buckled
and
cracked
and
i
looked
at
the
splice
in
the
forestay
to
see
if
it
yet
held
i
looked
a
thousand
times
and
a
thousand
times
the
honest
splice
that
i
had
poked
together
in
a
pleasant
shelter
under
bungay
woods
in
the
old
times
of
peace
before
ever
the
sons
of
the
achaians
came
to
the
land
stood
the
strain
the
sea
roared
over
the
and
gurgled
out
of
the
scuppers
and
still
we
held
on
till
æolus
blowing
much
more
loudly
and
what
you
may
think
a
lie
singing
through
the
rigging
though
we
were
before
the
wind
opposite
aldeburgh
i
thought
she
could
not
bear
it
any
more
i
turned
to
my
companion
and
said
let
us
drive
her
for
the
shore
and
have
done
with
it
she
can
not
live
in
this
we
will
jump
when
she
touches
but
he
having
a
chest
of
oak
and
being
bound
three
times
with
brass
said
drive
her
through
it
is
not
often
we
have
such
a
with
these
words
he
went
below
i
hung
on
for
orfordness
the
people
on
the
strand
at
aldeburgh
saw
us
an
old
man
desired
to
put
out
in
a
boat
to
our
aid
he
danced
with
fear
the
scene
still
stands
in
their
hollow
minds
as
orfordness
came
near
the
seas
that
had
hitherto
followed
like
giants
in
battle
now
took
to
a
mad
scrimmage
they
leapt
pyramidically
they
heaved
up
horribly
under
her
she
hardly
obeyed
her
helm
and
even
in
that
gale
her
canvas
flapped
in
the
troughs
then
in
despair
i
prayed
to
the
boat
itself
since
nothing
else
could
hear
me
oh
boat
for
so
i
was
taught
the
vocative
bear
me
safe
round
this
corner
and
i
will
scatter
wine
over
your
decks
she
heard
me
and
rounded
the
point
and
so
terrified
was
i
that
believe
me
if
you
will
i
had
not
even
the
soul
to
remember
how
ridiculous
and
laughable
it
was
that
sailors
should
call
this
cape
of
storms
the
onion
once
round
it
for
some
reason
i
will
not
explain
but
that
i
believe
connected
with
my
prayer
the
sea
grew
tolerable
it
still
came
on
to
the
land
we
could
sail
with
the
wind
starboard
and
the
wind
blew
harder
yet
but
we
ran
before
it
more
easily
because
the
water
was
less
steep
we
were
racing
down
the
long
drear
shingle
bank
of
oxford
past
what
they
call
the
house
on
the
chart
there
is
no
there
nor
ever
was
past
the
of
the
coastguard
till
we
saw
white
water
breaking
on
the
bar
of
the
alde
then
i
said
to
my
companion
there
are
i
know
two
mouths
to
this
harbour
a
northern
and
a
southern
which
shall
we
take
but
he
said
take
the
nearest
i
then
reciting
my
firm
beliefs
and
remembering
my
religion
ran
for
the
white
water
before
i
knew
well
that
she
was
round
the
sea
was
yellow
like
a
pond
the
waves
no
longer
heaved
but
raced
and
broke
as
they
do
upon
a
beach
one
greener
kindly
and
roaring
a
messenger
of
the
gale
grown
friendly
after
its
play
with
us
took
us
up
on
its
crest
and
ran
us
into
the
deep
and
calm
beyond
the
bar
but
as
we
crossed
the
gravel
ground
beneath
our
keel
so
the
boat
made
harbour
then
without
hesitation
she
cast
herself
upon
the
mud
and
i
sitting
at
the
tiller
my
companion
ashore
and
pushing
at
her
inordinate
sprit
but
both
revelling
in
safety
we
gave
thanks
and
praise
that
night
we
scattered
her
decks
with
wine
as
i
had
promised
and
lay
easy
in
deep
water
within
but
which
of
you
who
talk
so
loudly
about
the
island
race
and
the
command
of
the
sea
have
had
such
a
day
i
say
to
you
all
it
does
not
make
one
boastful
but
fills
one
with
humility
and
right
vision
go
out
some
day
and
run
before
it
in
a
gale
you
will
talk
less
and
think
more
i
dislike
the
memory
of
your
faces
i
have
written
for
your
correction
read
less
good
people
and
sail
more
and
above
all
leave
us
in
peace
the
singer
the
other
day
as
i
was
taking
my
pleasure
along
a
river
called
the
river
of
gold
from
which
one
can
faintly
see
the
enormous
mountains
which
shut
off
spain
from
europe
as
i
walked
i
say
along
the
mail
or
ordered
and
planted
quay
of
the
town
i
heard
a
long
way
off
a
man
singing
his
singing
was
of
that
very
deep
and
vibrating
kind
which
gascons
take
for
natural
singing
and
which
makes
one
think
of
hollow
metal
and
of
bells
for
it
sounds
through
the
air
in
waves
the
further
it
is
the
more
it
booms
and
it
occupies
the
whole
place
in
which
it
rises
there
is
no
other
singing
like
it
in
the
world
he
was
too
far
off
for
any
words
to
be
heard
and
i
confess
i
was
too
occupied
in
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
music
to
turn
round
at
first
and
notice
who
it
was
that
sang
but
as
he
gradually
approached
between
the
houses
towards
the
river
upon
that
happy
summer
morning
i
left
the
sight
of
the
houses
and
myself
sauntered
nearer
to
him
to
learn
more
about
him
and
his
song
i
saw
a
man
of
fifty
or
thereabouts
not
a
mountaineer
but
a
man
of
the
plains
tall
and
square
large
and
full
of
travel
his
face
was
brown
like
chestnut
wood
his
eyes
were
grey
but
ardent
his
brows
were
fierce
strong
and
of
the
colour
of
shining
metal
between
iron
and
silver
he
bore
himself
as
though
he
were
still
well
able
to
wrestle
with
younger
men
in
the
fairs
and
his
step
though
extremely
slow
for
he
was
intent
upon
his
song
was
determined
as
it
was
deliberate
i
came
yet
nearer
and
saw
that
he
carried
a
few
pots
and
pans
and
also
a
kind
of
kit
in
a
bag
in
his
right
hand
was
a
long
and
polished
staff
of
ashwood
shod
with
iron
and
still
as
he
went
he
sang
the
song
now
rose
nearer
me
and
more
loud
and
at
last
i
could
distinguish
the
words
which
were
in
english
these
men
that
cook
in
copper
know
well
how
difficult
is
the
cleaning
of
copper
all
cooking
is
a
double
labour
unless
the
copper
is
properly
tinned
this
couplet
rhymed
well
in
the
tongue
he
used
which
was
not
languedoc
nor
even
béarnais
but
ordinary
french
of
the
north
well
chosen
rhythmical
and
sure
when
he
had
sung
this
couplet
once
glancing
as
he
sang
it
nobly
upwards
to
the
left
and
the
right
at
the
people
in
their
houses
he
paused
a
little
set
down
his
kit
and
his
pots
and
his
pans
and
leant
upon
his
stick
to
rest
a
man
in
white
clothes
with
a
white
square
cap
on
his
head
ran
out
of
a
neighbouring
door
and
gave
him
a
saucepan
which
he
accepted
with
a
solemn
salute
and
then
as
though
invigorated
by
such
good
fortune
he
lifted
his
burdens
again
and
made
a
dignified
progress
of
some
few
steps
forward
nearer
to
the
place
in
which
i
stood
he
halted
again
and
resumed
his
song
it
had
a
quality
in
it
which
savoured
at
once
of
the
pathetic
and
of
the
steadfast
its
few
notes
recalled
to
me
those
classical
themes
which
conceal
something
of
dreadful
fate
and
of
necessity
but
are
yet
instinct
with
dignity
and
with
the
majestic
purpose
of
the
human
will
and
athens
would
have
envied
such
a
song
the
words
were
these
all
kinds
of
game
izard
quails
and
wild
pigeon
are
best
roasted
upon
a
spit
but
what
spit
is
so
clean
and
fresh
as
a
spit
that
has
been
newly
tinned
when
he
had
sung
this
verse
by
way
of
challenge
to
the
world
he
halted
once
more
and
mopped
his
face
with
a
great
handkerchief
waiting
perhaps
for
a
spit
to
be
brought
but
none
came
the
spits
of
the
town
were
new
and
though
the
people
loved
his
singing
yet
they
were
of
too
active
and
sensible
a
kind
to
waste
pence
for
nothing
when
he
saw
that
spits
were
not
forthcoming
he
lifted
up
his
kit
again
and
changed
his
subject
just
by
so
pinch
as
might
attract
another
sort
of
need
he
sang
but
now
more
violently
and
as
though
with
a
worthy
protest
le
lièvre
et
le
lapin
quand
bien
cuit
ça
fait
du
bien
that
is
hare
and
rabbit
properly
cooked
do
one
great
good
and
then
added
after
the
necessary
pause
and
with
a
gesture
half
of
offering
and
half
of
disdain
but
who
can
call
them
well
cooked
if
the
tinning
of
the
pot
has
been
neglected
and
into
this
last
phrase
he
added
notes
which
hinted
of
sadness
and
of
disillusion
it
was
very
fine
as
he
was
now
quite
near
me
and
ready
through
the
slackness
of
trade
to
enter
into
a
conversation
i
came
quite
close
and
said
to
him
i
wish
you
good
day
to
which
he
answered
and
i
to
you
and
the
company
though
there
was
no
company
then
i
said
you
sing
and
so
advertise
your
trade
he
answered
i
do
it
lifts
the
heart
it
shortens
the
way
it
attracts
the
attention
of
the
citizens
it
guarantees
good
work
in
what
way
said
i
does
it
guarantee
good
work
the
man
he
answered
who
sings
loudly
clearly
and
well
is
a
man
in
good
health
he
is
master
of
himself
he
is
strict
and
when
people
hear
him
they
say
is
a
prompt
ready
and
serviceable
man
he
is
not
afraid
there
is
no
rudeness
in
him
he
is
urbane
swift
and
to
the
point
there
is
method
in
this
fellow
all
these
things
may
be
in
the
man
who
does
not
sing
but
singing
makes
them
apparent
therefore
in
our
trade
we
sing
but
there
must
be
some
i
said
who
do
not
sing
and
who
yet
are
good
tinners
at
this
he
gave
a
little
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
spread
down
his
hands
slightly
but
imperatively
there
are
such
said
he
they
are
even
numerous
but
while
they
get
less
trade
they
are
also
less
happy
men
for
i
would
have
you
note
saving
your
respect
and
that
of
the
company
that
this
singing
has
a
quality
it
does
good
within
as
well
as
without
it
pleases
the
singer
in
his
very
self
as
well
as
brings
him
work
and
clients
then
i
said
you
are
right
and
i
wish
to
god
i
had
something
to
tin
let
me
however
tell
you
something
in
place
of
the
trade
i
can
not
offer
you
all
things
are
trine
as
you
have
heard
here
he
nodded
and
your
singing
does
therefore
not
a
double
but
a
triple
good
for
it
gives
you
pleasure
within
it
brings
in
trade
and
content
from
others
and
it
delights
the
world
around
you
it
is
an
admirable
thing
when
he
heard
this
he
was
very
pleased
he
took
off
his
enormous
hat
which
was
of
straw
and
as
big
as
a
wheel
and
said
sir
to
the
next
meeting
and
went
off
singing
with
a
happier
and
more
triumphant
note
carrots
onions
lentils
and
beans
depend
upon
the
tinner
for
their
worth
to
mankind
on
mails
a
mail
is
a
place
set
with
trees
in
regular
order
so
as
to
form
alleys
sand
and
gravel
are
laid
on
the
earth
beneath
the
trees
masonry
of
great
solidity
grey
and
exquisitely
worked
surrounds
the
whole
except
on
one
side
where
strong
stone
pillars
carry
heavy
chains
across
the
entrance
a
mail
takes
about
two
hundred
years
to
mature
remains
in
perfection
for
about
a
hundred
more
and
then
for
all
i
know
begins
to
go
off
but
neither
the
exact
moment
at
which
it
fails
nor
the
length
of
its
decline
is
yet
fixed
for
all
mails
date
from
the
seventeenth
century
at
earliest
and
the
time
when
most
were
constructed
was
that
of
charles
ii
youth
and
louis
xiv
maturity
or
am
i
wrong
were
these
two
men
not
much
of
an
age
i
am
far
from
books
i
am
up
in
the
pyrenees
let
me
consider
dates
and
reconstruct
my
formula
i
take
it
that
charles
ii
was
more
than
a
boy
when
worcester
was
fought
and
when
he
drank
that
glass
of
ale
at
hotighton
at
the
george
and
dragon
there
and
crept
along
tinder
the
downs
to
bramber
and
so
to
shoreham
where
he
took
ship
and
was
free
i
take
it
therefore
that
when
he
came
back
in
he
must
have
been
in
the
thirties
more
or
less
but
how
far
in
the
thirties
i
dare
not
affirm
now
in
the
year
before
charles
ii
came
back
mazarin
signed
the
treaty
with
spain
at
that
time
louis
xiv
must
have
been
quite
a
young
man
again
he
died
about
thirty
years
after
charles
ii
and
he
was
seventy
something
when
he
died
i
am
increasingly
certain
that
charles
ii
was
older
than
louis
xiv
i
affirm
it
i
feel
no
hesitation
lord
how
dependent
is
mortal
man
upon
books
of
reference
an
editor
or
a
minister
of
the
crown
with
books
of
reference
at
his
elbow
will
seem
more
learned
than
erasmus
himself
in
the
wilds
but
let
any
man
who
reads
this
and
i
am
certain
five
out
of
six
have
books
of
reference
by
them
as
they
read
i
say
let
any
man
who
reads
this
ask
himself
whether
he
would
rather
be
where
he
is
in
london
on
this
august
day
for
it
is
august
or
where
i
am
which
is
up
in
los
altos
the
very
high
pyrenees
far
from
every
sort
of
derivative
and
secondary
thing
and
close
to
all
things
primary
i
will
describe
this
place
it
is
a
forest
of
beech
and
pine
it
grows
upon
a
so
steep
that
only
here
and
there
is
there
a
ledge
on
which
to
camp
great
precipices
of
limestone
diversify
the
wood
and
show
through
the
trees
tall
and
white
beyond
them
one
has
to
pick
one
way
very
carefully
along
the
steep
from
one
night
camp
to
another
and
often
one
spends
whole
hours
seeking
up
and
down
to
turn
a
face
of
rock
one
can
not
cross
it
seems
dead
silent
there
are
few
birds
and
even
at
dawn
one
only
hears
a
twittering
here
and
there
swirls
of
cloud
form
and
pass
beneath
one
in
the
gorge
and
hurry
up
the
opposing
face
of
the
ravine
they
add
to
this
impression
of
silence
and
the
awful
height
of
the
pines
and
the
utter
remoteness
from
men
in
some
way
enhance
it
yet
though
it
seems
dead
silent
it
is
not
really
so
and
if
you
were
suddenly
put
here
from
the
midst
of
london
you
would
be
confused
by
the
noise
which
we
who
know
the
place
continually
forget
and
that
is
the
waterfalls
all
the
way
down
the
gorge
for
miles
sawing
its
cut
in
sheer
surfaces
through
the
rock
crashes
a
violent
stream
and
all
the
valley
is
full
of
its
thunder
but
it
is
so
continuous
so
sedulous
that
it
becomes
part
of
oneself
one
does
not
lose
it
at
night
as
one
falls
asleep
nor
does
one
recover
it
in
the
morning
when
dreams
are
disturbed
by
a
little
stir
of
life
in
the
undergrowth
and
one
opens
one
eyes
to
see
above
one
the
bronze
of
the
dawn
it
possesses
one
does
this
noise
of
the
torrent
and
when
after
many
days
in
such
a
wood
i
pick
my
way
back
by
marks
i
know
to
a
ford
and
thence
to
an
old
shelter
long
abandoned
and
thence
to
the
faint
beginnings
of
a
path
and
thence
to
the
high
road
and
so
to
men
when
i
come
down
into
the
plains
i
shall
miss
the
torrent
and
feel
ill
at
ease
hardly
knowing
what
i
miss
and
i
shall
recall
los
altos
the
high
places
and
remember
nothing
but
their
loneliness
and
silence
i
shall
saunter
in
one
of
the
towns
of
the
plain
girons
or
another
along
the
riverside
and
under
the
lime
trees
which
reminds
me
of
mails
little
pen
little
fountain
pen
little
vagulous
blandulous
pen
companion
and
friend
whither
have
you
led
me
and
why
can
not
you
learn
the
plodding
of
your
trade
the
pyrenean
hive
shut
in
between
two
of
the
greatest
hills
in
europe
hills
almost
as
high
as
etna
and
covering
with
their
huge
bases
half
a
county
of
land
there
lies
in
the
spanish
pyrenees
a
little
town
it
has
been
mentioned
in
books
very
rarely
and
visited
perhaps
more
rarely
of
three
men
whom
in
my
life
i
have
heard
speak
its
name
two
only
had
written
of
it
and
but
one
had
seen
it
yet
to
see
it
is
to
learn
a
hundred
things
there
is
no
road
to
it
no
wheeled
thing
has
ever
been
seen
in
its
streets
the
crest
of
the
pyrenees
which
are
here
both
precipitous
and
extremely
high
is
not
a
ridge
nor
an
edge
but
a
great
wall
of
slabs
as
it
were
leaning
up
against
the
sky
through
a
crack
in
this
wall
between
two
of
these
huge
slabs
the
mountaineers
for
many
thousand
years
have
wormed
their
way
across
the
hills
but
the
height
and
the
extreme
steepness
of
the
last
four
thousand
feet
have
kept
that
passage
isolated
and
upon
the
french
side
the
path
has
recently
been
renewed
within
a
few
yards
upon
the
southern
slope
it
dwindles
and
almost
disappears
as
one
so
passes
from
the
one
country
to
the
other
it
is
for
all
the
world
like
the
shutting
of
a
door
between
oneself
and
the
world
for
some
reason
or
other
the
impression
of
a
civilisation
active
to
the
point
of
distress
follows
one
all
up
the
pass
from
the
french
railway
to
the
summit
of
the
range
but
when
that
summit
is
passed
the
new
and
brilliant
sun
upon
the
enormous
glaciers
before
one
the
absence
of
human
signs
and
of
water
impress
one
suddenly
with
silence
from
that
point
one
scrambles
down
and
down
for
hours
into
a
deserted
valley
all
noon
and
afternoon
and
evening
on
the
first
flats
a
rude
path
at
last
appears
a
river
begins
to
flow
great
waterfalls
pour
across
one
way
and
for
miles
upon
miles
one
limps
along
and
down
the
valley
across
sharp
boulders
such
as
mules
go
best
on
and
often
along
the
bed
of
a
stream
until
at
nightfall
if
one
has
started
early
and
has
put
energy
into
one
going
and
if
it
is
a
long
summer
day
then
at
nightfall
one
first
sees
cultivated
fields
patches
of
oats
not
half
an
acre
large
hanging
upon
the
sides
of
the
ravine
wherever
a
little
shelf
of
soil
has
formed
so
went
the
two
men
upon
an
august
evening
till
they
came
in
the
upon
something
which
might
have
been
rocks
or
might
have
been
ruins
grey
lumps
against
the
moon
they
were
the
houses
of
a
little
town
a
sort
of
gulf
winding
like
a
river
gorge
and
narrower
than
a
column
of
men
was
the
street
that
brought
us
in
but
just
as
we
feared
that
we
should
have
to
grope
our
way
to
find
companionship
we
saw
that
great
surprise
of
modern
mountain
villages
but
not
of
our
own
england
a
little
row
of
electric
lamps
hanging
from
walls
of
an
incalculable
age
here
in
this
heap
of
mountain
stones
and
led
by
this
last
of
inventions
we
heard
at
last
the
sound
of
music
and
knew
that
we
were
near
an
inn
the
moors
called
and
call
an
inn
fundouk
the
spaniards
call
it
fonda
to
this
fonda
therefore
we
went
and
as
we
went
the
sound
of
music
grew
louder
till
we
came
to
a
door
of
oak
studded
with
gigantic
nails
and
swung
upon
hinges
which
by
their
careful
workmanship
and
the
nature
of
their
grotesques
were
certainly
of
the
renaissance
indeed
the
whole
of
this
strange
hive
of
mountain
men
was
a
mixture
ignorance
sharp
modernity
utter
reclusion
barbaric
christian
ruinous
and
enduring
things
the
more
recent
houses
had
for
the
most
part
their
dates
marked
above
their
doors
there
were
some
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
many
of
the
seventeenth
but
the
rest
were
far
older
and
bore
no
marks
at
all
there
was
but
one
house
of
our
own
time
and
as
for
the
church
it
was
fortified
with
narrow
windows
made
for
arrows
not
only
did
the
moors
call
an
inn
a
fundouk
but
also
they
lived
and
live
not
on
the
ground
floor
but
on
the
first
floor
of
their
houses
so
after
them
the
spaniards
we
came
in
from
the
street
through
those
great
oaken
doors
not
into
a
room
but
into
a
sort
of
barn
with
a
floor
of
beaten
earth
from
this
a
stair
every
banister
of
which
was
separately
carved
in
a
led
up
to
the
storey
upon
which
the
inn
was
held
there
was
no
hour
for
the
meal
some
were
beginning
to
eat
some
had
ended
when
we
asked
for
food
it
was
prepared
but
an
hour
was
taken
to
prepare
it
and
it
was
very
vile
the
wine
also
was
a
wine
that
tasted
as
much
of
leather
as
of
grapes
and
reminded
a
man
more
of
an
old
saddle
than
of
vineyards
the
people
who
put
this
before
us
had
in
their
faces
courage
complete
innocence
carelessness
and
sleep
they
spoke
to
us
in
their
language
i
understood
it
very
ill
of
far
countries
which
they
did
not
clearly
know
they
hardly
knew
the
french
beyond
the
hills
as
no
road
led
into
their
ageless
village
so
did
no
road
lead
out
of
it
to
reach
the
great
cities
in
the
plain
and
the
railway
eighty
miles
away
why
there
was
the
telephone
they
slept
at
such
late
hours
as
they
chose
by
midnight
many
were
still
clattering
through
the
lane
below
no
order
and
no
law
compelled
them
in
anything
the
two
men
were
asleep
after
this
first
astonishing
glimpse
of
forgotten
men
and
of
a
strange
country
in
the
stifling
air
outside
there
was
a
clattering
of
the
hoofs
of
mules
and
an
argument
of
drivers
a
long
way
off
a
man
was
playing
a
little
stringed
instrument
and
there
was
also
in
the
air
a
noise
of
insects
buzzing
in
the
night
heat
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
whole
place
awoke
to
the
noise
of
a
piercing
cry
which
but
for
its
exquisite
tone
might
have
been
the
cry
of
pain
so
shrill
was
it
and
so
coercing
to
the
ear
it
was
maintained
and
before
it
fell
was
followed
by
a
succession
of
those
which
only
the
arabs
have
and
which
i
had
thought
finally
banished
from
europe
to
this
inhuman
and
appalling
song
were
set
loud
open
vowels
rather
than
words
of
the
two
men
one
leapt
at
once
from
his
bed
crying
out
this
is
the
music
this
is
what
i
have
desired
to
hear
for
this
is
what
he
had
once
been
told
could
be
heard
in
the
desert
when
first
he
looked
out
over
the
sand
from
atlas
but
though
he
had
travelled
far
he
had
never
heard
it
and
now
he
heard
it
here
in
the
very
root
of
these
european
hills
it
was
on
this
account
that
he
cried
out
this
is
the
music
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
put
on
a
great
rough
cloak
and
ran
to
the
room
from
which
the
song
or
cry
proceeded
and
after
him
ran
his
companion
the
two
men
stood
at
the
door
behind
a
great
mass
of
muleteers
who
all
craned
forward
to
where
upon
a
dais
at
the
end
of
the
room
sat
a
jewess
who
still
continued
for
some
five
minutes
this
intense
and
terrible
effort
of
the
voice
beside
her
a
man
who
was
not
of
her
race
urged
her
on
as
one
urges
an
animal
to
further
effort
crying
out
hap
hap
and
beating
his
palms
together
rhythmically
and
driving
and
goading
her
to
the
full
limit
of
her
power
the
sound
ceased
suddenly
as
though
it
had
been
stabbed
and
killed
and
the
woman
whose
eyes
had
been
strained
and
lifted
throughout
as
in
a
trance
and
whose
body
had
been
rigid
and
quivering
sank
down
upon
herself
and
let
her
eyelids
fall
and
her
head
bent
forward
there
was
complete
silence
from
that
moment
till
the
dawn
and
the
second
of
the
two
men
said
to
the
first
that
they
had
had
an
experience
not
so
much
of
music
as
of
fire
delft
delft
is
the
most
charming
town
in
the
world
it
is
one
of
the
neat
cities
trim
small
packed
a
good
woman
in
early
middle
age
careful
of
her
dress
combined
orderly
not
without
a
sober
beauty
such
a
woman
on
her
way
to
church
of
a
sunday
morning
is
not
more
pleasing
than
delft
it
is
on
the
verge
of
monotony
yet
still
individual
in
one
style
yet
suggesting
many
centuries
of
activity
there
is
a
full
harmony
of
many
colours
yet
the
memory
the
place
leaves
is
of
a
united
warm
and
generous
tone
were
you
suddenly
put
down
in
delft
you
would
know
very
well
that
the
vast
and
luxuriant
meadows
of
holland
surrounded
it
so
much
are
its
air
houses
and
habits
those
of
men
inspired
by
the
fields
delft
is
very
quiet
as
befits
a
town
so
many
of
whose
streets
are
ordered
lanes
of
water
yet
one
is
inspired
all
the
while
by
the
voices
of
children
and
the
place
is
strongly
alive
over
its
sky
there
follow
in
stately
order
the
great
white
clouds
of
summer
and
at
evening
the
haze
is
lit
just
barely
from
below
with
that
transforming
level
light
which
is
the
joy
and
inspiration
of
the
netherlands
against
such
an
expanse
stands
up
for
ever
one
of
the
gigantic
but
delicate
belfries
round
which
these
towns
are
gathered
for
holland
it
seems
is
not
a
country
of
villages
but
of
compact
clean
towns
standing
scattered
over
a
great
waste
of
grass
like
the
sea
this
belfrey
of
delft
is
a
thing
by
itself
in
europe
and
all
these
truths
can
be
said
of
it
by
a
man
who
sees
it
for
the
first
time
first
that
its
enormous
height
is
drawn
up
as
it
were
and
enhanced
by
every
chance
stroke
that
the
instinct
of
its
slow
builders
lit
upon
for
these
men
of
the
infinite
flats
love
the
contrast
of
such
pinnacles
and
they
have
made
in
the
labour
of
about
a
thousand
years
a
landscape
of
their
own
by
building
just
as
they
have
made
by
ceaseless
labour
a
rich
pasture
and
home
out
of
those
solitary
marshes
of
the
delta
secondly
that
height
is
inhanced
by
something
which
you
will
not
see
save
in
the
low
countries
between
the
hills
of
ardennes
and
the
yellow
seas
i
mean
brick
gothic
for
the
gothic
which
you
and
i
know
is
built
up
of
stone
and
even
so
produces
every
effect
of
depth
and
distance
but
the
gothic
of
the
netherlands
is
often
built
curiously
of
bricks
and
the
bricks
are
so
thin
that
it
needs
a
whole
host
of
them
in
an
infinity
of
fine
lines
to
cover
a
hundred
feet
of
wall
they
fill
the
blank
spaces
with
their
repeated
detail
they
make
the
style
which
even
in
stone
is
full
of
chances
and
particular
corners
most
intricate
and
if
one
may
use
so
exaggerated
a
metaphor
populous
above
all
they
lead
the
eye
up
and
up
making
a
comparison
and
measure
of
their
tiny
bands
until
the
domination
of
a
buttress
or
a
tower
is
exaggerated
to
the
enormous
now
the
belfry
of
delft
though
all
the
upper
part
is
of
stone
yet
it
stands
on
a
great
pedestal
as
it
were
of
brick
a
pedestal
higher
than
the
houses
and
in
this
base
are
pierced
two
towering
broad
and
single
ogives
empty
and
wonderful
and
full
of
that
untragic
sadness
which
you
may
find
also
in
the
drooping
and
wide
eyes
of
extreme
old
age
thirdly
the
very
structure
of
the
thing
is
bells
here
the
bells
are
more
than
the
soul
of
a
christian
spire
they
are
its
body
too
its
whole
self
an
army
of
them
fills
up
all
the
space
between
the
delicate
supports
and
framework
of
the
upper
parts
for
i
know
not
how
many
feet
in
order
diminishing
in
actual
size
and
in
the
perspective
also
of
that
triumphant
elevation
stand
ranks
on
ranks
of
bells
from
the
solemn
to
the
wild
from
the
large
to
the
small
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
or
a
thousand
there
is
here
the
prodigality
of
brabant
and
hainaut
and
the
batavian
blood
a
generosity
and
a
productivity
in
bells
without
stint
the
man
who
designed
it
saying
since
we
are
to
have
bells
let
us
have
bells
not
measured
out
calculated
expensive
and
prudent
bells
but
careless
bells
multitudinous
bells
bells
without
fear
bells
excessive
and
bells
innumerable
bells
worthy
of
the
ecstasies
that
are
best
thrown
out
and
published
in
the
clashing
of
bells
for
bells
are
single
like
real
pleasures
and
we
will
combine
such
a
great
number
that
they
shall
be
like
the
happy
and
complex
life
of
a
man
in
a
word
let
us
be
noble
and
scatter
our
bells
and
reap
a
harvest
till
our
town
is
famous
for
its
bells
so
now
all
the
spire
is
more
than
clothed
with
them
they
are
more
than
stuff
or
ornament
they
are
an
outer
and
yet
sensitive
armour
all
of
bells
nor
is
the
wealth
of
these
bells
in
their
number
only
but
also
in
their
use
for
they
are
not
reserved
in
any
way
but
ring
tunes
and
add
harmonies
at
every
half
and
quarter
and
at
all
the
hours
both
by
night
and
by
day
nor
must
you
imagine
that
there
is
any
obsession
of
noise
through
this
they
are
far
too
high
and
melodious
and
what
is
more
too
thoroughly
a
part
of
all
the
spirit
of
delft
to
be
more
than
a
perpetual
and
impression
of
continual
music
they
render
its
air
sacred
and
fill
it
with
something
so
akin
to
an
uplifted
silence
as
to
leave
one
when
one
has
passed
from
their
influence
asking
what
balm
that
was
which
soothed
all
the
harshness
of
sound
about
one
round
that
tower
and
that
voice
the
town
hangs
industrious
and
subdued
a
family
its
waters
its
intimate
canals
its
boats
for
travel
and
its
slight
plashing
of
bows
in
the
place
of
wheels
entered
the
spirit
of
the
traveller
and
gave
him
for
one
long
day
the
right
of
burgess
in
autumn
in
the
early
afternoon
the
very
season
for
those
walls
it
was
easy
for
him
to
be
filled
with
a
restrained
but
united
chorus
the
of
the
city
droning
and
murmuring
perpetually
of
peace
and
of
labour
and
of
the
wild
rose
content
peace
labour
and
content
three
very
good
words
and
summing
up
perhaps
the
goal
of
all
mankind
of
course
there
is
a
problem
everywhere
and
it
would
be
heresy
to
say
that
the
people
of
delft
have
solved
it
it
is
matter
of
breviary
that
the
progress
of
our
lives
is
but
asymptotic
to
true
joy
we
can
approach
it
nearer
and
nearer
but
we
can
never
reach
it
nevertheless
i
say
that
in
this
excellent
city
though
it
is
outside
eden
you
may
when
the
wind
is
in
the
right
quarter
receive
in
distant
and
rare
appeals
the
scent
and
air
of
paradise
the
soul
is
filled
to
this
emotion
there
corresponds
and
shall
here
be
quoted
a
very
noble
verse
which
runs
or
rather
glides
as
follows
satiety
that
momentary
flower
stretched
to
an
hour
these
are
her
gifts
which
all
mankind
may
use
and
all
refuse
or
words
to
that
effect
and
to
think
that
you
can
get
to
a
place
like
that
for
less
than
a
pound
the
wing
of
dalua
time
was
and
that
not
so
long
ago
when
the
two
men
had
revealed
to
them
by
their
genius
a
corner
of
europe
wherein
they
were
promised
more
surprises
and
delights
than
in
any
other
it
was
secretly
made
known
to
them
that
in
this
place
there
were
no
pictures
and
no
one
had
praised
its
people
and
further
that
no
saint
had
ever
troubled
it
and
the
rich
and
all
their
evils
so
the
two
men
were
assured
had
never
known
the
place
at
all
it
was
under
the
influence
of
such
a
message
that
they
at
once
began
walking
at
a
great
speed
for
the
river
which
is
called
the
river
of
gold
and
for
the
valleys
of
andorra
and
since
it
seemed
that
other
men
had
dared
to
cross
the
pyrenees
and
to
see
the
republic
and
since
it
seemed
also
according
to
books
records
and
what
not
that
may
have
been
truth
or
may
have
been
lies
that
common
men
so
doing
went
always
by
one
way
called
the
way
of
hospitalet
the
two
men
determined
to
go
by
no
such
common
path
but
to
march
all
clothed
with
power
in
a
straight
line
and
to
take
the
main
range
of
the
mountains
just
where
they
chose
and
to
come
down
upon
the
andorrans
unexpectedly
and
to
deserve
their
admiration
and
perhaps
their
fear
they
chose
therefore
upon
the
map
the
valley
of
that
torrent
called
the
aston
and
before
it
was
evening
but
at
an
hour
when
the
light
of
the
sun
was
already
very
ripe
and
low
they
stood
under
a
great
rock
called
guie
which
was
all
of
bare
limestone
with
façades
as
bare
as
the
yosemite
and
almost
as
clean
they
looked
up
at
this
great
rock
of
guie
and
made
it
the
terminal
of
their
attempt
i
was
one
and
my
companion
was
the
other
these
were
the
two
men
who
started
out
before
a
sunset
in
august
to
conquer
the
high
pyrenees
before
me
was
a
very
deep
valley
full
of
woods
and
reaching
higher
and
higher
perpetually
so
that
it
reminded
me
of
hyperion
but
as
for
my
companion
it
reminded
him
of
nothing
for
he
said
loudly
that
he
had
never
seen
any
such
things
before
and
had
never
believed
that
summits
of
so
astonishing
a
height
were
to
be
found
on
earth
not
even
at
night
had
he
imagined
such
appalling
upward
and
upward
into
the
sky
and
this
he
said
though
he
had
seen
the
alps
of
which
it
is
true
that
when
you
are
close
to
them
they
are
very
middling
affairs
but
not
so
the
pyrenees
which
are
not
only
great
but
also
terrible
for
they
are
haunted
as
you
shall
hear
but
before
i
begin
to
write
of
the
spirits
that
inhabit
the
deserts
of
the
aston
i
must
first
explain
for
the
sake
of
those
who
have
not
seen
them
how
the
awful
valleys
of
the
pyrenees
are
made
all
the
high
valleys
of
mountains
go
in
steps
but
those
of
the
pyrenees
in
a
manner
more
regular
even
than
those
of
the
sierra
nevada
out
in
california
which
the
pyrenees
so
greatly
resemble
for
the
steps
here
are
nearly
always
three
in
number
between
the
plain
and
the
main
chain
and
each
is
entered
by
a
regular
gate
of
rock
so
it
is
in
the
valley
of
the
ariege
and
so
it
is
in
that
of
the
aston
and
so
it
is
in
every
other
valley
until
you
get
to
the
far
end
where
live
the
cleanly
but
incomprehensible
basques
each
of
these
steps
is
perfectly
level
somewhat
oval
in
shape
a
mile
or
two
or
sometimes
five
miles
long
but
not
often
a
mile
broad
through
each
will
run
the
river
of
the
valley
and
upon
either
side
of
it
there
will
be
rich
pastures
and
a
high
plain
of
this
sort
is
called
a
the
same
as
in
california
is
called
a
flat
as
dutch
flat
poverty
flat
and
other
famous
flats
first
then
will
come
a
great
gorge
through
which
one
marches
up
from
the
plain
and
then
at
the
head
of
it
very
often
a
waterfall
of
some
kind
along
the
side
of
which
one
forces
one
way
up
painfully
through
a
narrow
chasm
of
rock
and
finds
above
one
the
great
green
level
of
the
first
jasse
with
the
mountains
standing
solemnly
around
it
and
then
when
one
has
marched
all
along
this
level
one
will
come
to
another
gorge
and
another
chasm
and
when
one
has
climbed
over
the
barrier
of
rock
and
risen
up
another
feet
or
so
one
comes
to
a
second
jasse
smaller
as
a
rule
than
the
lower
one
but
so
high
are
the
mountains
that
all
this
climbing
into
the
heart
of
them
does
not
seem
to
have
reduced
their
height
at
all
and
then
one
marches
along
this
second
jasse
and
one
comes
to
yet
another
gorge
and
climbs
up
just
as
one
did
the
two
others
through
a
chasm
where
there
will
be
a
little
waterfall
or
a
large
one
and
one
finds
at
the
top
the
smallest
and
most
lonely
of
the
jasses
this
often
has
a
lake
in
it
the
mountains
round
it
will
usually
be
cliffs
forming
sometimes
a
perfect
ring
and
so
called
cirques
or
by
the
spaniards
and
as
one
stands
on
the
level
floor
of
one
such
last
highest
jasse
and
looks
up
at
the
summit
of
the
cliffs
one
knows
that
one
is
looking
at
the
ridge
of
the
main
chain
then
it
is
one
business
if
one
desires
to
conquer
the
high
pyrenees
to
find
a
sloping
place
up
the
cliffs
to
reach
their
summits
and
to
go
down
into
the
further
spanish
valleys
this
is
the
order
of
the
pyrenean
dale
and
this
was
the
order
of
that
of
the
aston
up
the
gorge
then
we
went
my
companion
and
i
the
day
fell
as
we
marched
and
there
was
a
great
moon
out
filling
the
still
air
when
we
came
to
the
first
chasm
and
climbing
through
it
saw
before
us
spread
with
a
light
mist
over
its
pastures
the
first
jasse
under
the
moonlight
and
up
we
went
and
up
again
to
the
end
of
the
second
jasse
having
before
us
the
vast
wall
of
the
main
range
and
in
our
hearts
a
fear
that
there
was
something
unblessed
in
the
sight
of
it
for
though
neither
i
told
it
to
my
companion
nor
he
to
me
we
had
both
begun
to
feel
a
fear
which
the
shepherds
of
these
mountains
know
very
well
it
was
perhaps
midnight
or
a
little
more
when
we
made
our
camp
after
looking
in
vain
for
a
hut
which
may
once
have
stood
there
but
now
stood
no
longer
we
lit
a
fire
but
did
not
overcome
the
cold
which
tormented
us
throughout
the
night
for
the
wind
blew
off
the
summits
and
at
last
we
woke
from
our
and
spent
the
miserable
hours
in
watching
the
great
bear
creeping
round
the
pole
and
in
trying
to
feed
the
dying
embers
with
damp
fuel
and
there
it
was
that
i
discovered
what
i
now
make
known
to
the
world
namely
that
gorse
and
holly
will
burn
of
themselves
even
while
they
are
yet
rooted
in
the
ground
so
we
sat
sleepless
and
exhausted
and
not
without
misgiving
for
we
had
meant
that
night
before
camping
to
be
right
under
the
foot
of
the
last
cliffs
and
we
were
yet
many
miles
away
we
were
glad
to
see
the
river
at
last
in
the
meadows
show
plainly
under
the
growing
light
the
rocks
turning
red
upon
the
and
the
extinction
of
the
stars
as
we
so
looked
north
and
eastward
the
great
rock
of
guie
stood
up
all
its
thousands
of
feet
enormous
against
the
rising
of
the
sun
we
were
very
weary
and
invigorated
by
nothing
but
the
light
but
having
that
at
least
to
strengthen
us
we
made
at
once
for
the
main
range
knowing
very
well
that
once
we
were
over
it
it
would
be
downhill
all
the
way
and
seeing
upon
our
maps
that
there
were
houses
and
living
men
high
in
the
further
andorran
valley
which
was
not
deserted
like
this
vale
of
the
aston
but
inhabited
full
that
is
of
catalans
who
would
soon
make
us
forget
the
inhuman
loneliness
of
the
heights
for
by
this
time
we
were
both
convinced
though
still
neither
of
us
said
it
to
the
other
that
there
was
an
evil
brooding
over
all
this
place
it
was
noon
when
after
many
hours
of
broken
marching
and
stumbling
which
betrayed
our
weakness
we
stood
at
last
beside
the
tarn
in
which
the
last
cliffs
of
the
ridge
are
reflected
and
here
was
a
steep
slope
up
which
a
man
could
scramble
we
drank
at
the
foot
of
it
the
last
of
our
wine
and
ate
the
last
of
our
bread
promising
ourselves
refreshment
light
and
peace
immediately
upon
the
further
side
and
thus
lightened
of
our
provisions
and
with
more
heart
in
us
we
assaulted
the
final
hill
but
just
at
the
summit
where
there
should
have
greeted
us
a
great
view
over
spain
there
lowered
upon
us
the
angry
folds
of
a
black
cloud
and
the
first
of
the
accidents
that
were
set
in
order
by
some
enemy
to
ruin
us
fell
upon
my
companion
and
me
for
a
storm
broke
and
that
with
such
violence
that
we
thought
it
would
have
shattered
the
bare
hills
for
an
infernal
thunder
crashed
from
one
precipice
to
another
and
there
flashed
now
close
to
us
now
vividly
but
far
off
in
the
thickness
of
the
cloud
great
useless
and
blinding
glares
of
lightning
and
hailstones
of
great
size
fell
about
us
also
leaping
from
the
bare
rocks
like
marbles
and
when
the
rain
fell
it
was
just
as
though
it
had
been
from
a
hose
forced
at
one
by
a
pressure
instead
of
falling
and
we
two
on
that
height
were
the
sole
objects
of
so
much
fury
until
at
last
my
companion
cried
out
from
the
rock
beneath
which
he
was
cowering
this
is
intolerable
and
i
answered
him
from
the
rock
which
barely
covered
me
it
is
not
to
be
borne
so
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
we
groped
our
way
down
into
the
valley
beneath
and
got
below
the
cloud
and
when
we
were
there
we
thought
we
had
saved
the
day
for
surely
we
were
upon
the
southern
side
of
the
hills
and
in
a
very
little
while
we
should
see
the
first
roofs
of
the
andorrans
for
two
doubtful
hours
we
trudged
down
that
higher
valley
but
there
were
no
men
nor
any
trace
of
men
except
this
that
here
and
there
the
semblance
of
a
path
appeared
especially
where
the
valley
fell
rapidly
from
one
stage
to
another
over
smooth
rocks
which
in
their
least
dangerous
descent
showed
by
smooth
scratches
the
passage
of
some
lost
animal
for
the
rest
nothing
human
nor
the
memory
of
it
was
there
to
comfort
us
though
in
one
place
we
found
a
group
of
cattle
browsing
alone
without
a
master
there
we
sat
down
in
our
exhaustion
and
confessed
at
last
what
every
hour
had
inwardly
convinced
us
of
with
greater
strength
that
we
were
not
our
own
masters
that
there
was
trouble
and
fate
all
round
us
that
we
did
not
know
what
valley
this
might
be
and
that
the
storm
had
been
but
the
beginning
of
an
unholy
adventure
we
had
been
snared
into
fairyland
we
did
not
speak
much
together
for
fear
of
lowering
our
hearts
yet
more
by
the
confession
one
to
the
other
of
the
things
we
knew
to
be
true
we
did
not
tell
each
other
what
reserve
of
courage
remained
to
us
or
of
strength
we
sat
and
looked
at
the
peaks
immeasurably
above
us
and
at
the
veils
of
rain
between
them
and
at
the
black
background
of
the
sky
nor
was
there
anything
in
the
landscape
which
did
not
seem
to
us
unearthly
and
forlorn
it
was
in
a
manner
more
lonely
than
had
been
the
very
silence
of
the
further
slope
there
was
less
to
comfort
and
support
the
soul
of
a
man
but
with
every
step
downward
we
were
penetrated
more
and
more
with
the
presence
of
things
not
mortal
and
of
influences
to
which
any
desolation
is
preferable
at
one
moment
voices
called
to
us
from
the
water
at
another
we
heard
our
names
but
pronounced
in
a
whisper
so
slight
and
so
exact
that
the
more
certain
we
were
of
hearing
them
the
less
did
we
dare
to
admit
the
reality
of
what
we
had
heard
in
a
third
place
we
saw
twice
in
succession
though
we
were
still
going
forward
the
same
tree
standing
by
the
same
stone
for
neither
tree
nor
stone
were
natural
to
the
good
world
but
each
had
been
put
there
by
whatever
was
mocking
us
and
drawing
us
on
already
had
we
stumbled
twice
and
thrice
the
distance
that
should
have
separated
us
from
the
first
andorran
village
but
we
had
seen
nothing
not
a
wall
nor
smoke
from
a
fire
let
alone
the
tower
of
a
christian
church
or
the
houses
of
men
nor
did
any
length
of
the
way
now
make
us
wonder
more
than
we
had
already
wondered
nor
did
we
hope
however
far
we
might
proceed
that
we
should
be
saved
unless
some
other
influence
could
be
found
to
save
us
from
the
unseen
masters
of
this
place
for
by
this
time
we
had
need
of
mutual
comfort
and
openly
said
it
to
one
another
but
in
low
tones
that
the
valley
was
faëry
the
river
went
on
calling
to
us
all
the
while
in
places
it
was
full
of
distant
cheering
in
others
crowded
with
the
laughter
of
a
present
multitude
of
tiny
things
and
always
mocking
us
with
innumerable
tenuous
voices
it
grew
to
be
evening
it
was
nearly
two
days
since
we
had
seen
a
man
there
stood
in
the
broader
and
lower
part
of
the
valley
to
which
we
had
now
come
numerous
rocks
and
boulders
for
our
deception
some
one
of
them
or
another
would
seem
to
be
a
man
i
heard
my
companion
call
suddenly
as
though
to
a
stranger
and
as
he
called
i
thought
that
he
had
indeed
perceived
the
face
of
a
human
being
and
i
felt
a
sort
of
sudden
health
in
me
when
i
heard
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
when
i
looked
up
i
also
saw
a
man
we
came
towards
him
and
he
did
not
move
close
up
beside
his
form
we
put
out
our
hands
but
what
we
touched
was
a
rough
and
silent
stone
after
that
we
spoke
no
more
we
went
on
through
the
gathering
twilight
determined
to
march
downwards
to
the
end
but
knowing
pretty
well
what
the
end
would
be
once
only
did
we
again
fall
into
the
traps
that
were
laid
about
us
when
we
went
and
knocked
at
the
hillside
where
we
thought
we
had
seen
a
cottage
and
its
oaken
door
and
after
the
mockery
of
that
disappointment
we
would
not
be
deceived
again
nor
make
ourselves
again
the
victims
of
the
laughter
that
perpetually
proceeded
from
the
torrent
the
path
led
us
onwards
in
a
manner
that
was
all
one
with
the
plot
now
woven
round
our
feet
we
could
but
follow
the
path
though
we
knew
with
what
an
evil
purpose
it
was
made
that
it
was
as
phantom
as
the
rest
at
one
place
it
invited
us
to
cross
upon
two
shaking
pine
trunks
the
abyss
of
a
cataract
in
another
it
invited
us
to
climb
in
spite
of
our
final
weariness
a
great
barrier
of
rock
that
lay
between
an
upper
and
a
lower
jasse
we
continued
upon
it
determinedly
with
heads
bent
barely
hoping
that
perhaps
at
last
we
should
emerge
from
this
haunted
ground
but
the
illusions
which
had
first
mocked
us
we
resolutely
refused
so
much
so
that
where
at
one
place
there
stood
plainly
before
us
in
the
gathering
darkness
a
with
its
trees
and
its
close
its
orchard
and
its
garden
gate
i
said
to
my
companion
all
this
place
is
cursed
and
i
will
not
go
near
and
he
applauded
me
for
he
knew
as
well
as
i
that
if
we
had
gone
a
few
steps
towards
that
orchard
and
that
garden
close
they
would
have
turned
into
the
bracken
of
the
hillside
bare
granite
and
unfruitful
scree
the
main
range
where
it
appeared
in
revelations
behind
us
through
the
clouds
was
far
higher
than
mountains
ever
seem
to
waking
men
and
it
stood
quite
sheer
as
might
a
precipice
in
a
dream
the
forests
upon
either
side
ran
up
until
they
were
lost
miles
and
miles
above
us
in
the
storm
night
fell
and
we
still
went
onward
the
one
never
daring
to
fall
far
behind
the
other
and
once
or
twice
in
an
hour
calling
to
each
other
to
make
sure
that
another
man
was
near
but
this
we
did
not
continue
because
as
we
went
on
each
of
us
became
aware
under
the
midnight
of
the
presence
of
a
third
there
was
a
place
where
the
path
now
broad
and
plain
approached
a
sort
of
little
sandy
bay
going
down
towards
the
stream
and
there
i
saw
by
a
sudden
glimpse
of
the
moon
through
the
clouds
a
large
cave
standing
wide
we
went
down
to
it
in
silence
we
gathered
brushwood
we
lit
a
fire
and
we
lay
down
in
the
cave
but
before
we
lay
down
i
said
to
my
companion
i
have
seen
the
moon
she
is
in
the
into
what
place
have
we
come
he
said
to
me
in
answer
nothing
here
is
earthly
and
after
he
had
said
this
we
both
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
in
which
we
forgot
not
only
cold
great
hunger
and
fatigue
but
our
own
names
and
our
very
souls
and
passed
as
it
were
into
a
deep
bath
of
forgetfulness
when
we
woke
at
the
same
moment
it
was
dawn
we
stood
up
in
the
clear
and
happy
light
and
found
that
everything
was
changed
we
poured
water
upon
our
faces
and
our
hands
strode
out
a
hundred
yards
and
saw
again
the
features
of
a
man
he
had
a
kind
face
of
some
age
and
eyes
such
as
are
the
eyes
of
mountaineers
which
seem
to
have
constantly
contemplated
the
distant
horizons
and
wide
plains
beneath
their
homes
we
heard
as
he
came
up
the
sound
of
a
bell
in
a
christian
church
below
and
we
exchanged
with
him
the
salutations
of
living
men
then
i
said
to
him
what
day
is
this
he
said
sunday
and
a
sort
of
memory
of
our
fear
came
on
us
for
we
had
lost
a
day
then
i
said
to
him
what
river
are
we
upon
and
what
valley
is
this
he
answered
the
river
and
the
valley
of
the
aston
and
what
he
said
was
true
for
as
we
rounded
a
corner
we
perceived
right
before
us
a
barrier
that
rock
of
guie
from
which
we
had
set
out
we
had
come
down
again
into
france
and
into
the
very
dale
by
which
we
had
begun
our
ascent
but
what
that
valley
was
which
had
led
us
from
the
summits
round
backward
to
our
forcing
upon
us
the
refusal
of
whatever
powers
protect
this
passage
of
the
chain
i
have
never
been
able
to
tell
it
is
not
upon
the
maps
by
our
description
the
peasants
knew
nothing
of
it
no
book
tells
of
it
no
men
except
ourselves
have
seen
it
and
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
it
is
not
of
this
world
on
ely
there
are
two
ways
by
which
a
man
may
acquire
any
kind
of
learning
or
profit
and
this
is
especially
true
of
travel
everybody
knows
that
one
can
increase
what
one
has
of
knowledge
or
of
any
other
possession
by
going
outwards
and
outwards
but
what
is
also
true
and
what
people
know
less
is
that
one
can
increase
it
by
going
inwards
and
inwards
there
is
no
goal
to
either
of
these
directions
nor
any
term
to
your
advantage
as
you
travel
in
them
if
you
will
be
extensive
take
it
easy
the
infinite
is
always
well
ahead
of
you
and
its
symbol
is
the
sky
if
you
will
be
intensive
hurry
as
much
as
you
like
you
will
never
exhaust
the
complexity
of
things
and
the
truth
of
this
is
very
evident
in
a
garden
or
even
more
in
the
nature
of
insects
of
which
beasts
i
have
heard
it
said
that
the
most
stolid
man
in
the
longest
of
lives
would
acquire
only
a
cursory
knowledge
of
even
one
kind
as
for
instance
of
the
horned
beetle
which
sings
so
angrily
at
evening
you
may
travel
for
the
sake
of
great
horizons
and
travel
all
your
life
and
fill
your
memory
with
nothing
but
views
from
and
yet
not
have
seen
a
tenth
of
the
world
or
you
may
spend
your
life
upon
the
religious
history
of
east
rutland
and
plan
the
most
enormous
book
upon
it
and
yet
find
that
you
have
continually
to
excise
and
select
from
the
growing
mass
of
your
material
a
wise
man
having
told
me
this
some
days
before
and
i
having
believed
it
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
a
new
entertainment
had
been
invented
for
me
or
rather
as
though
i
had
found
a
bottomless
purse
since
by
this
doctrine
there
was
manifestly
no
end
to
the
number
of
my
pleasures
and
to
each
of
this
infinite
number
no
possibility
of
exhaustion
but
i
thought
i
would
put
it
to
the
test
in
this
way
putting
aside
but
three
days
i
determined
in
that
space
to
explore
a
little
corner
of
this
country
now
although
i
saw
not
of
the
buildings
or
the
people
in
this
very
small
space
and
though
i
knew
nothing
of
the
birds
or
the
beasts
or
the
method
of
tillage
or
of
anything
of
all
that
makes
up
a
land
yet
i
saw
enough
to
fill
a
book
and
the
pleasure
of
my
thoughts
was
so
great
that
i
determined
to
pick
out
a
bit
here
and
a
bit
there
and
to
put
down
the
notes
almost
without
arrangement
in
order
that
those
who
can
not
do
these
things
whether
from
lack
of
leisure
or
for
some
other
reason
may
get
some
part
of
my
pleasure
without
loss
to
me
on
the
contrary
with
profit
and
in
order
that
every
one
may
be
convinced
of
what
this
little
journey
finally
taught
me
and
which
i
repeat
that
there
is
an
inexhaustible
treasure
everywhere
not
only
outwards
but
inwards
i
had
known
the
ouse
how
many
years
ago
had
looked
up
at
those
towers
of
ely
from
my
boat
but
a
town
from
a
river
and
a
town
from
the
street
are
two
different
things
moreover
in
that
time
i
speak
of
the
day
years
ago
it
was
blowing
very
hard
from
the
south
and
i
was
anxious
to
be
away
before
it
and
away
i
went
down
to
lynn
at
one
stretch
for
in
those
days
the
wind
and
the
water
seemed
of
more
moment
than
old
stones
now
after
how
many
years
it
was
my
business
to
go
up
by
land
and
as
i
went
the
weight
of
the
cathedral
filled
the
sky
before
me
impressions
of
this
sort
are
explained
by
every
man
in
his
own
way
for
my
part
i
felt
the
norman
i
know
not
by
what
accident
it
was
but
never
had
i
come
so
nearly
into
the
presence
of
the
men
who
founded
england
the
isolation
of
the
hill
the
absence
of
clamour
and
false
noise
and
everything
modern
the
smallness
of
the
village
the
solidity
and
amplitude
of
the
homes
and
their
security
all
recalled
an
origin
i
went
into
the
door
of
the
cathedral
under
the
high
tower
i
noted
the
ponderous
simplicity
of
the
great
squat
pillars
the
rough
capitals
plain
bulges
of
stone
without
so
much
as
a
pattern
cut
upon
them
the
round
arch
and
the
low
aisles
but
in
one
corner
remaining
near
the
door
a
baptistery
i
suppose
was
a
crowd
of
ornament
which
like
everything
of
that
age
bore
the
mark
of
simplicity
for
it
was
an
endless
heap
of
the
arch
and
the
column
and
the
zigzag
ornament
the
broken
line
its
richness
was
due
to
nothing
but
the
repetition
of
similar
forms
and
everywhere
the
low
stature
the
muscles
the
broad
shoulders
of
the
thing
proved
and
reawoke
the
memory
of
the
norman
soldiers
they
have
been
written
of
enough
but
who
has
seen
them
from
close
by
or
understood
that
brilliant
interlude
of
power
the
little
men
vivacious
and
splendidly
brave
we
know
that
they
awoke
all
europe
that
the
first
provided
settled
financial
systems
and
settled
governments
of
land
and
that
everywhere
from
the
grampians
to
mesopotamia
they
were
like
steel
when
all
other
christians
were
like
wood
or
like
lead
we
know
that
they
were
a
flash
they
were
not
formed
or
definable
at
all
before
the
year
by
the
year
they
were
gone
some
odd
transitory
phenomenon
of
a
very
lucky
freak
in
the
history
of
the
european
family
produced
the
only
body
of
men
who
all
were
lords
and
who
in
their
collective
action
showed
continually
nothing
but
genius
we
know
that
they
were
the
as
it
were
of
the
gallic
spirit
the
vanguard
of
that
one
of
the
gallic
expansions
which
we
associate
with
the
opening
of
the
middle
ages
and
with
the
crusades
we
know
all
this
and
write
about
it
nevertheless
we
do
not
make
enough
of
the
normans
in
england
here
and
there
a
man
who
really
knows
his
subject
and
who
disdains
the
market
of
the
school
books
puts
as
it
should
be
put
their
conquest
of
this
island
and
their
bringing
into
our
blood
whatever
is
still
strongest
in
it
many
descended
from
their
leaders
have
remarked
their
magical
ride
through
south
italy
their
ordering
of
sicily
their
hand
in
palestine
as
for
the
normans
in
normandy
of
their
exchequer
there
of
what
rouen
was
all
that
has
never
been
properly
written
down
at
all
their
great
adventure
here
in
england
has
been
most
written
of
by
far
but
i
say
again
no
one
has
made
enough
of
them
no
one
has
brought
them
back
out
of
their
graves
the
character
of
what
they
did
has
been
lost
in
these
silly
little
modern
quarrels
about
races
which
are
but
the
unscholarly
expression
of
a
deeper
hypocritical
quarrel
about
religion
yet
it
is
in
england
that
the
norman
can
be
studied
as
he
can
be
studied
nowhere
else
he
did
not
write
here
as
in
sicily
upon
a
palimpsest
he
was
not
merged
here
as
in
the
orient
with
the
rest
of
the
french
he
was
segregated
here
he
can
be
studied
in
isolation
for
though
so
many
that
crossed
the
sea
on
that
september
night
with
william
the
big
leader
of
them
held
no
norman
tenure
yet
the
spirit
of
the
whole
thing
was
norman
the
regularity
the
suddenness
the
achievement
and
when
the
short
fighting
was
over
the
creation
of
a
new
society
it
was
the
norman
who
began
everything
over
again
the
first
fresh
influence
since
rome
the
riot
of
building
has
not
been
seized
the
island
was
conquered
in
it
was
a
place
of
heavy
foolish
men
with
random
laws
pale
eyes
and
a
slow
manner
their
houses
were
of
wood
sometimes
they
built
but
how
painfully
and
how
childishly
with
stone
there
was
no
height
there
was
no
dignity
there
was
no
sense
of
permanence
the
norman
government
was
established
at
once
rapidity
energy
the
clear
object
of
a
united
and
organised
power
followed
and
see
what
followed
in
architecture
alone
and
in
what
a
little
space
of
the
earth
and
in
what
a
little
stretch
of
time
less
than
the
time
that
separates
us
from
the
year
of
disraeli
death
or
the
occupation
of
egypt
the
conquest
was
achieved
in
in
that
same
year
they
pulled
down
the
wooden
shed
at
bury
st
edmunds
unworthy
they
said
of
a
great
saint
and
began
the
great
shrine
of
stone
next
year
it
was
the
castle
at
oxford
in
monkswearmouth
jarrow
and
the
church
at
chester
in
rochester
and
st
albans
in
winchester
ely
worcester
thorney
hurley
lincoln
followed
with
the
next
years
by
they
had
tackled
gloucester
by
carlisle
by
lindisfarne
christchurch
tall
durham
and
this
is
but
a
short
and
random
list
of
some
of
their
greatest
works
in
the
space
of
one
boyhood
hundreds
of
castles
houses
village
churches
are
unrecorded
were
they
not
indeed
a
people
and
all
that
effort
realised
itself
before
pope
urban
had
made
the
speech
which
launched
the
armies
against
the
holy
land
the
norman
had
created
and
founded
all
this
before
the
mass
of
europe
was
urged
against
the
flame
of
the
arab
to
grow
fruitful
and
to
be
transformed
one
may
say
of
the
norman
preceding
the
gothic
what
dante
said
of
virgil
preceding
the
faith
would
that
they
had
been
born
in
a
time
when
they
could
have
known
it
but
the
east
was
not
yet
open
the
mind
of
europe
had
not
yet
received
the
great
experience
of
the
crusades
the
normans
had
no
medium
wherein
to
express
their
mighty
soul
save
the
round
arch
and
the
straight
line
the
capital
barbaric
or
naked
the
sullen
round
shaft
of
the
pillar
more
like
a
drum
than
like
a
column
they
could
build
as
with
nothing
but
the
last
ruins
of
rome
they
were
given
no
forms
but
the
forms
which
the
fatigue
and
lethargy
of
the
dark
ages
had
repeated
for
six
hundred
years
they
were
capable
even
in
the
north
of
impressing
even
these
forms
with
a
superhuman
majesty
was
i
not
right
in
saying
that
everywhere
in
the
world
one
can
look
in
and
in
and
never
find
an
end
to
one
delight
i
began
to
explore
but
a
tiny
corner
of
england
and
here
in
one
corner
of
that
corner
and
in
but
one
thought
arising
from
this
corner
of
a
corner
i
have
found
these
things
but
england
is
especially
a
garden
of
this
sort
or
a
storehouse
and
in
nothing
more
than
in
this
matter
of
the
old
architecture
which
perpetuates
the
barbaric
grandeur
of
the
eleventh
century
the
time
before
it
was
full
day
when
the
gothic
came
the
whole
of
northern
europe
was
so
enamoured
of
it
that
common
men
bishops
and
kings
pulled
down
and
rebuilt
everywhere
old
crumbling
walls
of
the
romanesque
fell
at
amiens
you
can
still
see
them
cowering
at
beauvais
only
an
accident
of
fire
destroyed
them
in
notre
dame
in
england
the
transition
survived
nowhere
save
in
england
is
the
northern
romanesque
triumphant
not
even
at
caen
elsewhere
the
gothic
has
conquered
only
here
in
england
can
you
see
the
romanesque
facing
like
an
equal
newer
things
because
here
only
was
there
a
great
outburst
of
building
a
kind
of
false
spring
before
the
gothic
came
because
here
only
in
europe
had
a
great
political
change
and
a
great
flood
of
wealth
come
in
before
the
expansion
of
the
twelfth
century
began
there
is
one
little
corner
of
england
here
is
another
the
isle
of
ely
lying
on
the
fens
is
like
a
starfish
lying
on
a
flat
shore
at
low
tide
southward
westward
and
northward
from
the
head
or
centre
of
the
clump
which
is
where
the
cathedral
stands
it
throws
out
arms
every
way
and
these
arms
have
each
short
tentacles
of
their
own
in
between
the
spurs
runs
the
even
fen
like
a
calm
sea
and
on
the
crest
of
the
spurs
radiating
also
from
ely
run
the
roads
long
ago
there
was
but
one
road
of
these
that
linked
up
the
isle
with
the
rest
of
england
it
was
the
road
from
the
south
and
there
the
romans
had
a
station
the
others
led
only
to
the
farms
and
villages
dependent
upon
the
city
now
they
are
prolonged
by
artifice
into
the
modern
causeways
which
run
over
the
lower
and
land
the
isle
has
always
stood
like
a
fortress
and
has
always
had
a
title
and
commandership
which
once
were
very
real
things
the
people
told
me
that
the
king
of
england
third
title
was
marquis
of
ely
and
i
knew
of
myself
that
just
before
the
civil
wars
the
commandership
of
the
isle
gave
the
power
of
raising
men
the
ends
of
many
wars
drifted
to
this
place
to
die
here
was
the
last
turn
of
the
saxon
lords
and
the
last
rally
of
the
feudal
rebellions
of
the
thirteenth
century
not
that
the
fens
were
impassable
or
homeless
but
they
were
difficult
in
patches
their
paths
were
rare
and
laid
upon
no
general
system
their
inhabited
fields
were
isolated
their
waters
tidal
with
great
banks
of
treacherous
mud
intricate
and
unbridged
such
conditions
are
amply
sufficient
for
a
defensive
war
the
flight
of
a
small
body
in
such
a
land
can
always
baffle
an
army
until
that
small
body
is
thrust
into
some
one
refuge
so
well
defended
by
marsh
or
river
that
the
very
defence
cuts
off
retreat
and
a
small
body
so
brought
to
bay
in
such
a
place
has
this
further
advantage
that
from
the
bits
of
higher
land
the
islands
one
of
the
first
requirements
of
defence
is
afforded
an
unbroken
view
of
every
avenue
by
which
attack
can
come
there
is
no
surprising
such
forts
so
much
is
in
ely
and
a
great
deal
more
for
instance
a
third
and
last
idea
out
of
the
thousand
that
ely
arouses
ely
is
dumb
and
yet
oracular
the
town
and
the
hill
tell
you
nothing
till
you
have
studied
them
in
silence
and
for
some
considerable
time
this
boast
is
made
by
many
towns
that
they
hold
a
secret
but
ely
which
is
rather
a
village
than
a
town
has
alone
a
true
claim
the
proof
of
which
is
this
that
no
one
comes
to
ely
for
a
few
hours
and
carries
anything
away
whereas
no
man
lives
in
ely
for
a
year
without
beginning
to
write
a
book
i
do
not
say
that
all
are
published
but
i
swear
that
all
are
begun
the
inn
of
the
margeride
whatever
keeping
its
proportion
and
form
is
designed
upon
a
scale
much
greater
or
much
less
than
that
of
our
general
experience
produces
upon
the
mind
an
effect
of
phantasy
a
little
perfect
model
of
an
engine
or
a
ship
does
not
only
amuse
or
surprise
it
rather
casts
over
the
imagination
something
of
that
veil
through
which
the
world
is
transfigured
and
which
i
have
called
the
wing
of
dalua
the
medium
of
appreciations
beyond
experience
the
medium
of
vision
of
original
passion
and
of
dreams
the
principal
spell
of
childhood
returns
as
we
bend
over
the
astonishing
details
we
are
giants
or
there
is
no
secure
standard
left
in
our
intelligence
so
it
is
with
the
common
thing
built
much
larger
than
the
million
examples
upon
which
we
had
based
our
petty
security
it
has
been
always
in
the
nature
of
worship
that
heroes
or
the
gods
made
manifest
should
be
men
but
larger
than
men
not
tall
men
or
men
grander
but
men
transcendent
men
only
in
their
form
in
their
dimension
so
much
superior
as
to
be
lifted
out
of
our
world
an
arch
as
old
as
rome
but
not
yet
ruined
found
on
the
sands
of
africa
arrests
the
traveller
in
this
fashion
in
his
modern
cities
he
has
seen
greater
things
but
here
in
africa
where
men
build
so
squat
and
punily
cowering
under
the
heat
upon
the
parched
ground
so
noble
and
so
considerable
a
span
carved
as
men
can
carve
under
sober
and
temperate
skies
catches
the
mind
and
clothes
it
with
a
sense
of
the
strange
and
of
these
emotions
the
strongest
perhaps
is
that
which
most
of
those
who
travel
go
seeking
the
enchantment
of
mountains
the
air
by
which
we
know
them
for
something
utterly
different
from
high
hills
accustomed
to
the
contour
of
downs
and
tors
or
to
the
valleys
and
long
slopes
that
introduce
a
range
we
come
to
some
wider
horizon
and
see
far
off
a
further
line
of
hills
to
hills
all
the
mind
is
attuned
a
moderate
ecstasy
the
clouds
are
above
the
hills
lying
level
in
the
empty
sky
men
and
their
ploughs
have
visited
it
seems
all
the
land
about
us
till
suddenly
faint
but
hard
a
cloud
less
varied
a
greyer
portion
of
the
infinite
sky
itself
is
seen
to
be
permanent
above
the
world
then
all
our
grasp
of
the
wide
view
breaks
down
we
change
the
valleys
and
the
tiny
towns
the
unseen
mites
of
men
the
gleams
or
thread
of
roads
are
prostrate
covering
a
little
watching
space
before
the
shrine
of
this
dominant
and
towering
presence
it
is
as
though
humanity
were
permitted
to
break
through
the
vulgar
illusion
of
daily
sense
and
to
learn
in
a
physical
experience
how
unreal
are
all
the
absolute
standards
by
which
we
build
it
is
as
though
the
vast
and
the
unexpected
had
a
purpose
and
that
purpose
were
the
showing
to
mankind
in
rare
glimpses
what
places
are
designed
for
the
soul
those
ultimate
places
where
things
common
become
shadows
and
fail
and
the
divine
part
in
us
which
adores
and
desires
breathes
its
own
air
and
is
at
last
alive
this
awful
charm
which
attaches
to
the
enormous
envelops
the
causse
of
mende
for
its
attributes
are
all
of
them
pushed
beyond
the
ordinary
limit
each
of
the
four
causses
is
a
waste
but
the
causse
of
mende
is
utterly
bereft
of
men
each
is
a
high
plateau
but
this
i
believe
the
highest
in
feet
and
certainly
in
impression
you
stand
there
as
it
were
upon
the
summit
of
a
lonely
pedestal
with
nothing
but
a
rocky
edge
around
you
each
is
dried
up
but
the
catisse
of
mende
is
without
so
much
as
a
or
a
well
it
is
wrinkled
horny
and
cauterised
under
the
alternate
frost
and
flame
of
its
fierce
open
sky
as
are
the
deserts
of
the
moon
each
of
the
causses
is
silent
but
the
silence
of
the
causse
of
mende
is
scorched
and
frozen
into
its
stones
and
is
as
old
as
they
all
around
the
torrents
which
have
sawn
their
black
canons
upon
every
side
of
the
block
frame
this
silence
with
their
rumble
each
of
the
causses
casts
up
above
its
plain
fantastic
heaps
of
rock
consonant
to
the
wild
spirit
of
its
isolation
but
the
causse
of
mende
holds
a
kind
of
fortress
a
medley
so
like
the
ghost
of
a
dead
town
that
even
in
full
daylight
you
expect
the
footsteps
of
men
and
by
night
as
you
go
gently
in
fear
of
waking
the
sleepers
you
tread
quite
certainly
among
built
houses
and
spires
this
place
the
peasants
of
the
canons
have
called
the
old
city
and
no
one
living
will
go
near
it
who
knows
it
well
the
causses
have
also
this
peculiar
to
them
that
the
ravines
by
which
each
is
cut
off
are
steep
and
sudden
but
the
cliffs
of
the
causse
of
mende
are
walls
that
the
chief
of
these
walls
may
seem
the
more
terrible
it
is
turned
northwards
so
that
by
day
and
night
it
is
in
shadow
and
falls
sheer
it
was
when
i
had
abandoned
this
desolate
wonder
but
with
its
influence
strong
upon
me
that
i
left
the
town
of
mende
down
on
the
noise
of
its
river
and
began
to
climb
the
opposing
mountain
of
the
margeride
it
was
already
evening
though
as
yet
there
were
no
stars
the
air
was
fresh
because
the
year
was
at
that
season
when
it
is
summer
in
the
vineyard
plains
but
winter
in
the
hills
a
twilight
so
coloured
and
translucent
as
to
suggest
cold
spanned
like
an
aurora
the
western
mouth
of
the
gully
upon
my
eastward
and
upward
way
the
full
moon
not
yet
risen
began
to
throw
an
uncertain
glory
over
the
sky
this
road
was
made
by
the
french
kings
when
their
influence
had
crept
so
far
south
as
to
control
these
mountains
they
became
despots
and
their
despotism
which
was
everywhere
magnificent
engraved
itself
upon
these
untenanted
bare
rocks
they
strengthened
and
fortified
the
road
its
grandeur
in
so
empty
and
impoverished
a
land
was
a
boast
or
a
threat
of
their
power
the
republic
succeeded
the
kings
the
armies
succeeded
the
republic
and
every
experiment
succeeded
the
victories
and
the
breakdown
of
the
armies
the
road
grew
stronger
all
the
while
bridging
this
desert
and
giving
pledge
that
the
brain
of
paris
was
able
and
more
able
to
order
the
whole
of
the
soil
so
then
as
i
followed
it
it
seemed
to
me
to
bear
in
itself
and
in
its
contrast
with
untamed
surroundings
the
history
and
the
character
of
this
one
nation
out
of
the
many
which
live
by
the
tradition
of
europe
as
i
followed
it
and
saw
its
exact
gradient
its
hard
and
even
surface
its
square
border
stones
and
every
hundred
yards
its
carved
mark
of
the
distance
done
these
elaborations
standing
quite
new
among
the
tumbled
rocks
of
a
vague
upland
made
one
certain
that
paris
had
been
at
work
very
far
back
how
far
was
marked
on
the
milestone
the
road
had
left
the
swarming
gate
of
toulouse
very
far
on
how
far
was
marked
on
the
milestone
it
was
to
cross
the
saône
by
its
own
bridge
and
feed
the
life
of
lyons
in
between
it
met
and
surmounted
still
civilised
easy
complete
this
barbaric
watershed
of
the
margeride
as
i
followed
it
law
good
law
and
evil
seemed
to
go
with
me
up
the
mountain
side
there
was
more
sound
than
on
the
arid
wastes
of
the
causse
there
were
trees
and
birds
in
the
trees
moving
faintly
the
great
moon
which
had
now
risen
shone
also
upon
scanty
grass
and
from
time
to
time
upon
the
trickle
of
water
passing
in
runnels
beneath
the
road
the
torrent
in
the
depth
below
roared
openly
and
strong
and
beyond
it
the
black
wall
of
the
causse
immense
and
battlemented
above
me
under
the
moon
made
what
poor
life
this
mountain
supported
seem
for
a
moment
gracious
by
comparison
i
remembered
that
sheep
and
goats
and
men
could
live
on
the
margeride
but
the
margeride
has
rightly
compelled
its
few
historians
to
melancholy
or
fear
it
is
a
district
or
a
mountain
range
or
a
single
summit
which
cuts
off
the
east
from
the
west
the
loire
from
the
gironde
a
long
even
barrow
of
dark
stone
its
people
are
one
suspicious
of
the
plains
its
line
against
the
sky
is
also
one
no
critical
height
in
europe
is
so
strict
and
unbroken
you
may
see
it
from
a
long
way
east
from
the
velay
or
even
from
the
last
of
the
forèz
and
wonder
whether
it
is
a
land
or
a
sullen
bar
of
black
cloud
all
the
world
knows
how
snow
even
in
mere
gullies
and
streaks
uplifts
a
mountain
well
i
have
seen
the
dull
of
the
margeride
from
above
puy
in
spring
when
patches
of
snow
still
clung
to
it
and
the
snow
did
no
more
than
it
would
have
done
to
a
plain
it
neither
raised
nor
distinguished
this
brooding
thing
but
it
is
indeed
a
barrier
its
rounded
top
is
more
formidable
than
if
it
were
a
ridge
of
rock
its
saddle
broad
and
indeterminate
deceives
the
traveller
with
new
slight
slopes
following
one
upon
the
other
when
the
sharp
first
of
the
ascent
is
done
already
the
last
edge
of
the
causse
beyond
the
valley
had
disappeared
and
already
had
the
great
road
taken
me
higher
than
the
buttress
which
holds
up
that
when
thinking
i
had
gained
the
summit
i
turned
a
corner
in
the
way
and
found
a
vague
roll
of
rising
land
before
me
upon
this
also
under
the
strong
moonlight
i
saw
the
ruin
of
a
mill
water
therefore
must
have
risen
behind
it
i
expected
and
found
yet
another
uncertain
height
and
beyond
it
a
third
and
a
mile
beyond
another
this
summit
was
like
those
random
marshy
steps
which
rise
continually
and
wearily
between
the
sluggish
rivers
of
the
prairies
i
passed
the
fields
that
gave
his
title
to
la
peyrouse
the
cold
which
with
every
hundred
feet
had
increased
unnoticed
now
first
disturbed
me
the
wind
had
risen
for
i
had
come
to
that
last
stretch
of
the
glacis
over
which
from
beyond
the
final
height
an
eastern
wind
can
blow
and
this
wind
carried
i
know
not
what
dust
of
ice
that
did
not
make
a
perceptible
fall
yet
in
an
hour
covered
my
clothes
with
tiny
spangles
and
stung
upon
the
face
like
highland
snow
in
a
gale
with
that
wind
and
that
fine
powdery
frost
went
no
apparent
clouds
the
sky
was
still
clear
above
me
such
rare
stars
as
can
conquer
the
full
moon
shone
palely
but
round
the
moon
herself
bent
an
evanescent
halo
like
those
one
sees
over
the
channel
upon
clear
nights
before
a
stormy
morning
the
spindrift
of
fine
ice
had
i
think
defined
this
halo
how
long
i
climbed
through
the
night
i
do
not
know
the
summit
was
but
a
slight
accident
upon
a
tumbled
plain
the
ponds
stood
thick
with
ice
the
sound
of
running
water
had
ceased
when
the
slight
downward
of
the
road
through
a
barren
moor
and
past
broad
undrained
films
of
frozen
bog
told
me
that
i
was
on
the
further
northern
slope
the
wind
also
was
now
roaring
over
the
platform
of
the
watershed
and
great
patches
of
whirling
snow
lay
to
the
right
and
left
like
sand
upon
the
grassy
dunes
of
a
coast
through
all
this
loneliness
and
cold
i
went
down
with
the
great
road
for
a
companion
majesty
and
power
were
imposed
by
it
upon
these
savage
wilds
the
hours
uncalculated
and
the
long
arrears
of
the
night
had
confused
my
attention
the
wind
the
little
arrows
of
the
ice
the
absence
of
ploughlands
and
of
men
those
standards
of
measure
which
i
have
said
the
causses
so
easily
disturb
would
not
return
to
me
i
took
mile
after
mile
almost
unheeding
numbed
with
cold
demanding
sleep
but
ignorant
of
where
might
be
found
the
next
habitation
it
was
in
this
mood
that
i
noticed
on
a
distant
swirl
of
rocks
before
me
what
might
have
been
roofs
and
walls
but
in
that
haunted
country
the
rocks
play
such
tricks
as
i
have
told
the
moonlight
also
which
seems
so
much
too
bright
upon
a
lonely
heath
fails
one
altogether
when
distinction
must
be
made
between
distant
things
and
when
men
are
near
i
did
not
know
that
these
rocks
or
houses
were
the
high
group
of
chateauneuf
till
i
came
suddenly
upon
the
long
and
low
house
which
stands
below
it
on
the
road
and
is
the
highway
inn
for
the
mountain
town
beyond
i
halted
for
a
moment
because
no
light
came
from
the
windows
just
opposite
the
house
a
great
tomb
marked
the
fall
of
some
hero
the
wind
seemed
less
violent
the
waters
of
the
marshy
plain
had
gathered
they
were
no
longer
frozen
and
a
little
brook
ran
by
as
i
waited
there
hesitating
my
fatigue
came
upon
me
and
i
knocked
at
their
great
door
they
opened
and
light
poured
upon
the
road
and
the
noise
of
peasants
talking
loudly
and
the
roaring
welcome
of
a
fire
in
this
way
i
ended
my
crossing
of
these
sombre
and
unrecorded
hills
i
that
had
lost
count
of
hours
and
of
heights
in
the
glamour
of
the
midnight
and
of
the
huge
abandoned
places
of
my
climb
stepped
now
into
a
hall
where
the
centuries
also
mingled
and
lost
their
order
the
dancing
fire
filled
one
of
those
great
chimneys
that
witness
to
the
communal
life
of
the
middle
ages
around
and
above
it
ironwork
of
a
hundred
years
branched
from
the
to
support
the
drying
meats
of
the
winter
provision
a
wide
board
rude
and
shining
with
long
usage
reflected
the
stone
ware
and
the
wine
chairs
carved
grotesquely
and
as
old
almost
as
the
walls
about
me
stood
round
the
comfort
of
the
fire
i
saw
that
the
windows
were
deeper
than
a
arms
could
reach
and
made
for
fighting
i
saw
that
the
beams
of
the
high
roof
which
the
firelight
hardly
caught
were
black
oak
and
squared
enormously
like
the
ribs
of
a
and
in
the
leaves
and
garden
things
that
hung
from
them
in
the
mighty
stones
of
the
wall
and
the
beaten
earth
of
the
floor
the
strong
simplicity
of
our
past
and
the
promise
of
our
endurance
came
upon
me
the
peasants
sitting
about
the
board
and
fire
had
risen
looking
at
the
door
for
strangers
were
rare
and
it
was
very
late
as
i
came
out
of
the
empty
cold
into
that
human
room
their
dress
was
ancestral
the
master
as
he
spoke
to
me
mixed
new
words
with
old
he
had
phrases
that
the
black
prince
used
when
he
went
riding
at
arms
across
the
margeride
he
spoke
also
of
modern
things
of
the
news
in
the
valley
from
which
i
had
come
and
the
railway
and
puy
below
us
they
put
before
me
bread
and
wine
which
i
most
needed
i
sat
right
up
against
the
blaze
we
all
talked
high
together
of
the
things
we
knew
for
when
i
had
told
them
what
news
there
was
in
the
valley
they
also
answered
my
questions
into
which
i
wove
as
best
i
could
those
still
living
ancient
words
i
had
caught
from
their
mouths
i
asked
them
whose
was
that
great
tomb
under
the
moonlight
at
which
i
had
shuddered
as
i
entered
their
doors
they
told
me
it
was
duguesclin
tomb
for
he
got
his
here
under
the
walls
of
the
town
above
them
five
hundred
years
ago
and
in
this
house
he
had
died
then
i
asked
what
stream
that
was
which
trickled
from
the
moss
and
led
down
the
valley
of
my
next
day
journey
they
told
me
it
was
called
the
river
and
they
said
that
it
was
faëry
i
asked
them
also
what
was
the
name
of
the
height
over
which
i
had
come
they
answered
that
the
shepherds
called
it
the
house
and
that
hence
in
clear
weather
under
an
eastern
wind
one
could
see
far
off
beyond
the
velay
that
lonely
height
which
is
called
the
chair
of
god
so
we
talked
together
drinking
wine
and
telling
each
other
of
many
things
i
of
the
world
to
which
i
was
compelled
to
return
and
they
of
the
pastures
and
the
streams
and
all
the
story
of
lozère
and
all
the
while
not
the
antiquity
alone
but
the
endurance
of
christendom
poured
into
me
from
every
influence
around
they
rose
to
go
to
the
homes
which
were
their
own
without
a
lord
we
exchanged
the
last
salutations
the
wooden
soles
of
their
shoes
clattered
upon
the
stone
threshold
of
the
door
the
master
also
rose
and
left
me
i
sat
there
for
perhaps
an
hour
alone
with
the
falling
fire
before
me
and
a
vision
in
my
heart
though
i
was
here
on
the
very
roof
and
centre
of
the
western
land
i
heard
the
surge
of
the
inner
and
the
roll
of
the
outer
sea
the
foam
broke
against
the
hebrides
and
made
a
white
margin
to
the
cliffs
of
holy
ireland
the
tide
poured
up
beyond
our
islands
to
the
darkness
in
the
north
i
saw
the
german
towns
and
lombardy
and
the
light
on
rome
and
the
great
landscape
i
saw
from
the
summit
to
which
i
was
exalted
was
not
of
only
but
also
of
yesterday
and
perhaps
of
our
europe
can
not
perish
her
religion
which
is
also
mine
has
in
it
those
victorious
energies
of
defence
which
neither
merchants
nor
philosophers
can
understand
and
which
are
yet
the
prime
condition
of
establishment
europe
though
she
must
always
repel
attacks
from
within
and
from
without
is
always
secure
the
soul
of
her
is
a
certain
spirit
at
once
reasonable
and
chivalric
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
she
will
not
dissolve
by
expansion
nor
be
broken
by
internal
strains
she
will
not
suffer
that
loss
of
unity
which
would
be
for
all
her
members
death
and
for
her
history
and
meaning
and
self
an
utter
oblivion
she
will
certainly
remain
her
component
peoples
have
merged
and
have
remerged
her
particular
famous
cities
have
fallen
down
her
soldiers
have
believed
the
world
to
have
lost
all
because
a
battle
turned
against
them
hittin
or
leipsic
her
best
has
at
times
grown
poor
and
her
worst
rich
her
colonies
have
seemed
dangerous
for
a
moment
from
the
insolence
of
their
power
and
then
again
for
a
moment
from
the
contamination
of
their
decline
she
has
suffered
invasion
of
every
sort
the
east
has
wounded
her
in
arms
and
has
corrupted
her
with
ideas
her
vigorous
blood
has
healed
the
wounds
at
once
and
her
permanent
sanity
has
turned
such
corruptions
into
innocuous
follies
she
will
certainly
remain
so
that
old
room
by
its
very
age
reminded
me
not
of
decay
but
of
unchangeable
things
all
this
came
to
me
out
of
the
fire
and
upon
such
a
scene
passed
the
pageantry
of
our
astounding
history
the
armies
marching
perpetually
the
guns
and
ring
of
bronze
i
heard
the
chant
of
our
prayers
and
though
so
great
a
host
went
by
from
the
baltic
to
the
passes
of
the
pyrenees
the
myriads
were
contained
in
one
figure
common
to
them
all
i
was
refreshed
as
though
by
the
resurrection
of
something
loved
and
thought
dead
i
was
no
longer
afraid
of
time
that
night
i
slept
ten
hours
next
day
as
i
swung
out
into
the
air
i
knew
that
whatever
power
comforts
men
had
thrown
wide
open
the
gates
of
morning
and
a
gale
sang
strong
and
clean
across
that
pale
blue
sky
which
mountains
have
for
a
neighbour
i
could
see
the
further
valley
broadening
among
woods
to
the
warmer
places
and
i
went
down
beside
the
river
onwards
whither
it
pleased
me
to
go
a
family
of
the
fens
upon
the
very
limit
of
the
fens
not
a
hundred
feet
in
height
but
very
sharp
against
the
level
there
is
a
lonely
little
hill
from
the
edge
of
that
hill
the
land
seems
very
vague
the
flat
line
of
the
horizon
is
the
only
boundary
and
that
horizon
mixes
into
watery
clouds
no
countryside
is
so
formless
until
one
has
seen
the
plan
of
it
set
down
in
a
map
but
on
studying
such
a
map
one
understands
the
scheme
of
the
fens
the
wash
is
in
the
shape
of
a
keystone
with
the
narrow
side
towards
the
sea
and
the
broad
side
towards
the
land
imagine
the
wash
prolonged
for
twenty
or
thirty
miles
inland
and
broadened
considerably
as
it
proceeded
as
would
a
curving
fan
or
better
still
a
horseshoe
and
you
have
the
fens
a
horseshoe
whose
points
as
dugdale
says
are
the
corners
of
lincolnshire
and
norfolk
all
around
them
is
land
of
some
little
height
and
quite
dry
it
is
oölitic
on
the
east
chalky
on
the
south
and
the
old
towns
and
the
old
roads
look
from
all
round
this
amphitheatre
of
dry
land
down
upon
the
alluvial
flats
beneath
peterboro
cambridge
lynn
are
all
just
off
the
fens
and
the
ermine
street
runs
on
the
bank
which
forms
their
eastern
frontier
this
plain
has
suffered
very
various
fortunes
how
good
the
land
was
and
how
well
inhabited
before
the
ruin
of
the
monasteries
is
not
yet
completely
grasped
even
by
these
who
love
these
marshes
and
who
have
written
their
history
yet
there
is
physical
evidence
of
what
was
once
here
masses
of
trees
but
just
buried
grass
lying
mown
in
swathes
beneath
the
the
implements
of
men
where
now
no
men
can
live
the
great
buried
causeway
running
right
across
from
east
to
west
beyond
such
proofs
there
are
the
writers
who
rare
as
are
the
descriptions
of
medieval
scenery
manage
to
speak
of
this
for
henry
of
huntingdon
it
was
a
kind
of
garden
there
were
many
meres
in
it
but
there
were
also
islands
and
woods
and
orchards
william
of
malmesbury
writes
of
it
with
delight
and
mentions
even
its
vines
the
meres
were
not
impassable
marshes
for
instance
in
you
find
the
abbot
of
ramsay
owning
a
vessel
upon
whittlesea
mere
the
whole
impression
one
gets
from
the
earlier
time
is
that
of
something
like
the
upper
waters
of
the
rivers
in
the
broads
much
draining
and
a
good
many
ponds
but
most
of
the
land
firm
with
good
deep
pastures
and
a
great
diversity
of
woods
great
catastrophes
have
certainly
overcome
this
countryside
the
greatest
was
the
anarchy
of
the
sixteenth
century
but
it
is
probable
that
coincidently
with
every
grave
lesion
in
the
continuity
of
our
civilisation
the
fens
suffered
for
they
always
needed
the
perpetual
attention
of
man
to
keep
them
as
they
so
long
were
and
may
be
again
if
ever
our
people
get
back
their
land
and
restore
a
communal
life
fully
inhabited
afforested
and
cultured
it
is
probable
that
the
of
the
ninth
century
saw
the
fens
partly
drowned
and
that
after
the
black
death
something
of
the
same
sort
happened
again
for
it
is
in
the
latter
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
that
you
begin
to
hear
of
a
necessity
for
reclaiming
them
john
of
gaunt
had
a
scheme
and
morton
dug
a
ditch
which
is
still
called
morton
leam
i
say
every
defeat
of
our
civilisation
was
inflicted
here
in
the
fens
but
it
is
certain
that
the
principal
disaster
followed
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
these
great
foundations
nourishing
hundreds
and
governing
thousands
based
upon
the
populace
drawn
from
the
populace
and
living
by
the
common
life
were
scattered
throughout
the
fens
they
were
founded
on
the
islands
nearest
the
good
land
thorney
ramsay
croyland
ely
the
nuns
of
chatteris
they
dated
from
the
very
beginning
ely
was
founded
within
sight
of
our
conversion
croyland
came
even
before
that
before
civilisation
and
religion
were
truly
in
britain
penda
gave
it
its
charter
st
augustine
had
been
dead
for
little
more
than
a
century
when
the
charter
was
signed
even
as
the
monks
came
to
claim
their
land
they
discovered
hermits
long
settled
there
thorney
ancarig
it
was
then
was
even
fifty
years
older
than
croyland
the
roots
of
all
these
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
nation
ramsay
and
charteris
can
not
be
traced
beyond
the
gulf
of
the
danish
invasion
but
they
are
members
of
the
group
or
ring
of
houses
which
clustered
round
the
edge
of
the
dry
land
and
sent
out
its
industry
towards
the
wash
making
new
land
for
this
ring
sent
out
feelers
eastward
draining
the
land
and
recovering
it
every
way
founding
cells
establishing
villages
holbeach
spalding
freiston
holland
and
i
know
not
how
much
more
was
their
land
when
the
monasteries
were
destroyed
their
lordship
fell
into
the
hands
of
that
high
class
now
old
then
new
the
cromwells
and
russells
and
the
rest
upon
whom
has
since
depended
the
greatness
of
the
country
the
intensive
spirit
proper
to
a
teeming
but
humble
population
was
forgotten
the
extensive
economics
of
the
great
owners
their
love
of
distances
and
of
isolation
took
the
place
of
the
old
agriculture
within
a
generation
the
whole
land
was
drowned
the
isolated
villages
forgot
the
general
civilisation
of
england
they
came
to
depend
for
their
living
upon
the
wildfowl
of
the
marshes
here
and
there
was
a
little
summer
pasturing
more
rarely
a
little
ploughing
of
the
rare
patches
of
dry
land
but
the
whole
place
soon
ran
wild
and
there
englishmen
soon
grew
to
cause
an
endless
trouble
to
the
new
landlords
these
all
the
while
on
from
the
death
of
henry
to
that
of
elizabeth
pursued
their
vigilance
and
their
accumulations
their
power
rose
above
the
marshes
like
a
slow
sun
and
dried
them
up
at
last
in
every
inch
of
england
you
can
find
the
history
of
england
you
find
it
very
typically
here
the
growth
of
that
leisured
class
which
we
still
enjoy
the
class
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
destroyed
the
central
government
of
the
crown
penetrated
and
refreshed
the
universities
acquired
for
its
use
and
reformed
the
endowed
primary
education
of
the
english
and
began
a
thorough
occupation
of
our
public
land
the
growth
of
that
leisured
class
is
nowhere
more
clearly
to
be
seen
than
in
the
history
of
the
fens
since
the
fens
had
their
faith
removed
from
them
here
is
the
story
of
one
such
family
a
family
without
whose
privileges
and
public
services
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
modern
england
their
wealth
is
rooted
in
the
fens
the
growth
of
that
wealth
is
parallel
to
the
growth
of
every
fortune
by
which
we
are
governed
when
the
monasteries
were
despoiled
and
their
farms
thrown
open
to
a
gamble
when
the
water
ran
in
again
the
countryside
and
all
its
generations
of
human
effort
were
drowned
there
was
raised
up
for
the
restoration
of
this
land
the
family
of
russell
the
abbey
of
thorney
had
been
given
to
these
little
squires
they
were
in
possession
when
towards
the
end
of
elizabeth
reign
in
was
passed
the
general
draining
act
it
was
a
generous
and
a
broad
act
it
was
to
apply
not
only
to
the
great
level
but
to
all
the
marshes
of
the
realm
it
was
soon
bent
to
apply
to
the
family
seven
years
later
a
dutchman
of
the
name
of
cornelius
vermuyden
was
sent
for
that
the
work
might
be
begun
for
fifty
years
this
man
dug
and
intrigued
he
was
called
in
to
be
the
engineer
he
had
the
temerity
to
compete
with
the
new
landlords
he
boasted
a
desire
less
legitimate
in
an
alien
than
in
a
courtier
to
make
a
great
fortune
rapidly
he
was
ruined
all
the
adventurers
who
first
attempted
the
draining
of
the
fens
were
ruined
but
not
that
permanent
the
earl
of
bedford
surnamed
the
incomparable
the
story
of
vermuyden
by
him
is
intricate
but
every
englishman
now
living
on
another
man
land
should
study
it
vermuyden
was
to
drain
the
great
level
and
to
have
acres
for
his
pains
these
acres
were
in
the
occupation
for
the
matter
of
that
in
great
part
the
ownership
of
a
number
of
english
families
it
is
true
the
land
had
lain
derelict
for
seventy
years
bereft
of
capital
since
the
reformation
and
swamped
it
is
true
that
the
occupiers
and
owners
were
very
poor
it
is
true
therefore
that
they
could
not
properly
comprehend
a
policy
that
was
designed
for
the
general
advantage
of
the
country
they
only
understood
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
by
which
they
lived
were
to
stop
that
their
land
was
to
be
very
considerably
improved
and
taken
from
them
in
their
ignorance
of
ultimate
political
good
they
began
to
show
some
considerable
impatience
the
cry
of
the
multitude
has
a
way
of
taking
on
the
forms
of
stupidity
the
multitude
in
this
case
cried
out
against
vermuyden
they
objected
to
a
foreigner
being
given
so
much
freehold
in
an
anguish
of
despair
to
use
one
chronicler
words
they
threw
themselves
under
the
protection
of
a
leader
that
leader
was
of
course
francis
earl
of
bedford
surnamed
incomparable
he
could
not
hear
unmoved
the
cry
of
his
he
yielded
to
their
petition
took
means
to
oust
the
dutchmen
and
immediately
obtained
for
himself
the
grant
of
the
acres
by
a
royal
order
of
january
known
as
lynn
law
when
he
saw
the
extent
of
the
land
and
of
the
water
upon
it
even
his
tenacious
spirit
was
alarmed
he
therefore
associated
with
himself
in
the
expenses
thirteen
others
all
persons
of
rank
and
fortune
as
was
fitting
alone
of
the
fourteen
he
preserved
his
fortune
the
fourteen
then
began
the
digging
of
nine
drains
if
we
include
the
repair
of
morton
leam
the
largest
was
that
fine
miles
called
the
old
bedford
river
and
charles
i
though
all
in
favour
of
so
great
a
work
was
all
in
dread
of
the
power
it
might
give
to
the
class
which
as
his
prophetic
conscience
told
him
was
destined
to
be
his
ruin
there
was
a
contract
that
the
work
should
be
finished
in
six
years
when
the
six
years
were
ended
it
was
very
far
from
finished
the
king
grumbled
but
francis
earl
of
bedford
belonged
to
a
clique
already
half
as
powerful
as
the
crown
he
threatened
and
a
new
royal
order
gave
him
an
extension
of
time
it
was
the
second
of
his
many
victories
the
king
refused
to
forget
his
defeat
and
francis
earl
of
bedford
began
to
show
that
hatred
of
absolute
government
which
has
made
of
his
kind
the
leaders
of
a
happy
england
the
king
did
a
stuart
thing
he
lost
his
temper
he
said
you
may
keep
your
acres
but
i
shall
tax
them
and
he
did
francis
earl
of
bedford
felt
in
him
a
growing
passion
for
just
government
he
already
spoke
of
freedom
but
he
had
no
leisure
wherein
to
enjoy
it
for
within
two
years
he
departed
this
life
of
the
smallpox
leaving
to
his
son
william
the
legacy
of
the
great
battle
for
liberty
and
for
the
public
land
this
change
in
the
bedford
dynasty
coincided
with
the
civil
wars
william
russell
having
led
some
of
the
parliamentary
forces
at
edge
hill
was
so
uncertain
which
side
might
ultimately
be
victorious
as
to
open
secret
negotiations
with
the
king
nothing
happened
to
him
nor
even
to
his
brother
who
intrigued
later
against
cromwell
life
he
was
at
liberty
to
return
once
more
and
to
survey
from
the
walls
of
the
old
abbey
the
drowned
land
upon
which
he
had
set
his
heart
the
work
of
digging
could
not
be
carried
on
during
the
turmoil
of
the
time
william
earl
of
bedford
filled
his
leisure
in
the
framing
of
an
elaborate
bill
of
costs
it
was
dated
may
and
showed
the
sums
which
he
had
spent
and
which
had
been
wasted
in
the
failure
to
reclaim
the
fens
he
stated
them
at
over
and
to
this
he
added
like
a
good
business
man
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
for
so
many
years
as
to
amount
to
more
than
another
as
against
the
king
the
trick
was
a
good
one
but
like
many
another
financier
william
earl
of
bedford
was
shortsighted
the
more
anxious
the
king
grew
to
pay
out
public
money
to
the
russells
the
less
able
he
grew
to
do
so
till
at
last
he
lost
not
only
the
shadow
of
power
over
the
treasury
but
life
itself
and
william
earl
of
bedford
brought
in
his
bill
to
the
commonwealth
cromwell
was
of
the
same
class
and
knew
the
trick
too
well
he
gave
the
family
leave
to
prosecute
their
digging
to
forget
their
demand
for
money
the
act
was
passed
at
noon
bedford
was
sent
for
at
seven
the
next
morning
and
ordered
to
attend
upon
cromwell
and
make
thankful
acknowledgments
he
did
so
the
works
began
once
more
the
common
people
in
their
simplicity
rose
as
they
had
so
often
risen
before
against
a
benefit
they
could
not
comprehend
but
they
no
longer
had
a
stuart
to
deal
with
to
their
extreme
surprise
they
were
put
down
with
the
aid
of
the
military
then
for
all
the
world
as
in
the
promotion
of
a
modern
company
the
consulting
engineer
of
the
original
promotors
reappears
the
russells
had
patched
it
up
with
vermuyden
and
the
work
was
resumed
a
third
time
there
was
however
this
difficulty
that
though
englishmen
might
properly
be
constrained
at
this
moment
to
love
an
orderly
and
godly
life
and
to
relinquish
their
property
when
it
was
to
the
public
good
that
they
should
do
so
yet
it
would
have
been
abhorrent
to
the
whole
spirit
of
the
commonwealth
to
enslave
them
even
for
a
work
of
national
advantage
a
labour
difficulty
arose
and
the
works
were
in
grave
peril
those
whose
petty
envy
may
be
pleased
at
the
entanglement
of
william
earl
of
bedford
have
forgotten
the
destiny
which
maintains
our
great
families
in
the
worst
of
the
crisis
the
battle
of
dunbar
was
fought
scotch
prisoners
and
later
more
were
indentured
out
to
dig
the
ditches
and
it
was
printed
and
posted
in
the
end
of
that
it
was
death
without
mercy
for
any
to
attempt
to
escape
the
respite
was
not
for
long
heaven
as
though
to
try
the
patience
of
its
chosen
agent
raised
up
a
new
obstacle
before
the
great
patriot
peace
was
made
and
the
scotch
prisoners
were
sent
home
it
was
but
the
passing
frown
which
makes
the
succeeding
smiles
of
the
deity
more
gracious
at
that
very
moment
blake
was
defeating
the
dutch
upon
the
seas
and
these
excellent
prisoners
laborious
and
by
an
accident
which
clearly
shows
the
finger
of
divine
providence
especially
acquainted
with
the
digging
of
ditches
arrived
in
considerable
numbers
chained
and
were
handed
over
to
the
premier
house
at
the
same
time
it
was
ordered
by
the
lord
protector
that
when
the
acres
should
at
last
be
dry
any
protestant
even
though
he
were
a
foreigner
might
buy
two
years
later
an
unfortunate
peace
compelled
the
return
of
the
dutch
prisoners
but
the
work
was
done
and
the
earl
of
bedford
returned
thanks
in
his
cathedral
restored
to
the
leisure
which
is
necessary
for
political
action
the
russells
actively
intrigued
for
the
return
of
the
stuarts
and
pointed
out
when
charles
ii
was
well
upon
his
throne
how
necessary
it
was
for
the
fens
that
their
old
if
irregular
privileges
should
be
confirmed
it
was
argued
for
the
crown
that
acres
of
land
had
been
quietly
absorbed
by
the
family
while
there
was
no
king
in
england
but
there
happened
in
this
case
what
happened
in
every
other
since
the
upper
class
the
natural
leaders
of
the
people
had
curbed
the
tyranny
of
the
king
charles
capitulated
then
followed
of
course
popular
rising
it
was
quelled
before
their
long
struggle
for
freedom
against
the
stuart
dynasty
was
ended
the
peasants
had
been
taught
their
place
vermuyden
was
out
of
the
way
the
ditches
were
all
dug
the
land
acquired
all
the
world
knows
the
great
part
played
by
the
house
in
the
emancipation
of
england
from
the
yoke
of
james
ii
the
martyrdom
of
lord
william
may
have
cast
upon
the
family
a
passing
cloud
but
whatever
compensation
the
perishable
things
of
this
world
can
afford
they
received
and
accepted
in
having
assisted
at
the
destruction
of
yet
another
form
of
government
the
earl
of
bedford
was
made
duke
and
on
september
his
great
work
now
entirely
accomplished
he
departed
this
life
peacefully
in
his
year
it
was
once
more
in
their
cathedral
that
the
funeral
service
was
preached
by
a
freeman
chaplain
of
no
less
than
the
king
himself
i
have
read
the
sermon
in
its
entirety
it
closes
with
the
fine
phrase
that
william
the
fifth
earl
and
the
first
duke
of
bedford
had
sought
throughout
the
whole
of
a
laborious
and
patriotic
life
a
crown
not
corruptible
but
incorruptible
it
was
precisely
a
century
since
the
family
had
set
out
in
its
quest
for
that
hundred
square
miles
of
land
through
four
reigns
a
bloody
civil
war
three
revolutions
and
innumerable
treasons
it
had
maintained
its
purpose
and
at
last
it
reached
its
goal
molis
erat
romanam
condere
the
election
the
other
day
as
i
was
going
out
upon
my
travels
i
came
upon
a
plain
so
broad
that
it
greatly
wearied
me
this
plain
was
grown
in
parts
with
barley
but
as
it
stood
high
in
foreign
mountains
and
was
arid
very
little
was
grown
small
runnels
long
run
dry
under
the
heat
made
the
place
look
like
a
desert
almost
like
africa
nor
was
there
anything
to
relieve
my
gaze
except
a
huddle
of
small
grey
houses
far
away
but
when
i
reached
them
i
found
to
my
inexpressible
joy
a
railway
running
by
and
a
station
to
receive
me
for
those
who
complain
of
railways
talk
folly
and
prove
themselves
either
rich
or
more
probably
the
of
the
rich
a
railway
is
an
excellent
thing
it
takes
one
quickly
through
the
world
for
next
to
nothing
and
if
in
many
countries
the
people
it
takes
are
brutes
and
disfigure
all
they
visit
that
is
not
the
fault
of
the
railway
but
of
the
government
and
religion
of
these
people
which
between
them
have
ruined
the
citizens
of
the
state
so
was
it
not
in
this
place
of
which
i
speak
for
all
the
people
were
industrious
wealthy
kind
amenable
and
free
i
took
a
ticket
for
the
only
town
on
the
railway
list
whose
history
i
knew
and
then
in
a
carriage
made
entirely
of
wood
i
settled
down
to
a
conversation
with
my
kind
for
though
these
people
were
not
of
my
blood
indeed
i
am
certain
that
for
some
hundreds
of
years
not
a
drop
of
their
blood
has
mingled
with
my
own
yet
we
understood
each
other
by
a
common
tongue
called
lingua
franca
of
which
i
have
spoken
in
another
place
and
am
a
past
master
as
all
the
people
round
began
their
talk
of
cattle
land
and
weather
two
men
next
me
or
rather
the
one
next
me
and
the
other
opposite
me
began
to
talk
of
the
election
which
had
been
held
in
that
delightful
plain
by
which
as
i
learnt
a
dealer
in
herds
had
been
defeated
by
a
somewhat
usurious
and
perhaps
insignificant
attorney
in
this
election
more
than
half
the
voters
that
is
a
good
third
of
the
families
in
the
plain
had
gone
up
to
the
little
huts
of
wood
and
had
made
a
mark
upon
a
bit
of
paper
some
on
one
part
some
on
the
other
about
a
sixth
of
the
families
had
desired
the
dealer
in
herds
to
make
their
laws
and
about
a
sixth
the
attorney
of
the
rest
some
could
not
some
would
not
go
and
make
the
little
mark
of
which
i
speak
many
more
could
by
law
make
it
and
would
have
made
it
if
they
had
thought
it
useful
to
any
possible
purpose
under
the
sun
i
say
had
made
their
mark
for
the
aged
and
attorney
and
for
the
venerable
but
avaricious
dealer
in
herds
and
since
the
first
sixth
was
imperceptibly
larger
than
the
second
it
was
the
lawyer
not
the
merchant
who
stood
to
make
the
laws
for
the
people
but
not
only
to
make
laws
he
was
also
in
some
mystic
way
the
persona
and
representative
of
all
the
plain
the
long
fields
the
infinite
past
carolingian
enormous
the
delicate
fronds
of
young
trees
the
distant
sight
of
the
mountains
which
is
the
note
of
all
that
land
the
invasions
it
had
suffered
the
conquests
it
might
yet
achieve
its
soul
and
its
material
self
were
all
summed
up
in
the
solicitor
not
in
the
farmer
and
he
was
to
vote
on
peace
or
war
on
wine
or
water
on
god
or
no
god
in
the
schools
for
the
people
of
the
plain
were
they
had
no
lords
of
my
two
companions
the
one
had
voted
for
the
but
the
other
for
the
scribbler
upon
parchment
and
they
discussed
their
action
without
heat
gently
and
with
many
reasons
the
one
said
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
solidarity
of
society
demands
that
the
homogeneity
of
economic
interests
should
be
recognised
by
the
magistrate
the
other
said
the
first
need
is
rather
that
the
historic
continuity
of
society
should
be
affirmed
by
the
momentary
depositaries
of
the
executive
for
these
two
men
were
of
some
education
and
saw
things
from
a
higher
standpoint
than
the
peasants
around
us
who
continued
to
discourse
now
angrily
now
merrily
but
always
loudly
and
rapidly
upon
the
insignificant
matter
of
their
lives
that
is
strong
red
bubbling
wine
healthy
and
beef
rich
land
and
housing
the
marriage
of
daughters
and
the
putting
forward
of
sons
then
one
of
the
two
who
had
long
guessed
by
my
dress
and
face
from
what
country
i
came
said
to
me
and
you
how
is
it
in
your
country
i
told
him
we
met
from
time
to
time
upon
occasions
not
less
often
than
seven
years
apart
and
did
just
as
they
had
done
that
of
us
voted
one
way
and
the
other
the
first
let
us
say
for
a
moneylender
and
the
second
for
a
man
remarkable
for
or
famous
for
the
wealth
of
his
mother
and
whichever
sixth
was
imperceptibly
larger
than
the
other
that
sixth
carried
its
man
and
he
stood
for
the
flats
of
the
wash
or
for
the
clear
hills
of
cumberland
or
for
devon
which
is
all
one
great
and
lonely
hill
this
man
said
i
in
some
very
mystic
way
is
he
is
our
past
and
our
great
national
memory
by
his
vote
he
decides
what
shall
be
done
but
he
is
controlled
by
what
is
he
controlled
said
my
companions
eagerly
evidently
they
had
a
sneaking
love
of
seeing
representatives
controlled
by
a
committee
of
the
rich
said
i
promptly
at
this
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
said
it
is
a
bad
system
and
by
what
are
yours
said
i
at
this
the
gravest
and
oldest
of
them
looking
as
it
were
far
away
with
his
eyes
answered
by
the
name
of
our
country
and
a
wholesome
terror
of
the
people
your
system
said
i
shrugging
my
shoulders
in
turn
but
a
little
awkwardly
is
different
from
ours
after
this
we
were
silent
all
three
we
remembered
all
three
of
us
the
times
when
no
such
things
were
done
in
europe
and
yet
men
hung
well
together
and
a
nation
was
vaguer
and
yet
more
instinctive
and
ready
we
remembered
also
for
it
was
in
our
common
faith
the
gross
permanent
and
irremediable
imperfection
of
human
affairs
there
arose
perhaps
in
their
minds
a
sight
of
the
man
they
had
sent
to
be
the
spirit
and
spokesman
or
rather
the
very
self
of
that
golden
plateau
which
the
train
was
crawling
through
and
certainly
in
my
mind
there
rose
the
picture
of
a
man
small
false
and
vile
who
was
by
some
fiction
the
voice
of
a
certain
valley
in
my
own
land
then
i
said
to
them
as
i
left
the
train
at
the
town
i
spoke
of
days
knights
for
so
one
addresses
strangers
in
that
country
and
they
answered
your
grace
we
commend
you
to
god
arles
the
use
and
the
pleasure
of
travel
are
closely
mingled
because
the
use
of
it
is
fulfilment
and
in
fulfilling
oneself
a
great
pleasure
is
enjoyed
every
man
bears
within
him
not
only
his
own
direct
experience
but
all
the
past
of
his
blood
the
things
his
own
race
has
done
are
part
of
himself
and
in
him
also
is
what
his
race
will
do
when
he
is
dead
this
is
why
men
will
always
read
and
why
even
when
letters
are
at
their
lowest
still
remain
thus
if
a
diary
be
known
to
be
true
then
it
seems
vivid
and
becomes
famous
where
if
it
were
fiction
no
one
would
find
any
merit
in
it
history
therefore
once
a
man
has
begun
to
know
it
becomes
a
necessary
food
for
the
mind
without
which
it
can
not
sustain
its
new
dimension
it
is
an
aggregate
of
universal
experience
nor
other
things
being
equal
is
any
judgment
so
thin
and
weak
as
the
judgment
of
a
man
who
knows
nothing
of
the
past
but
history
if
it
is
to
be
kept
just
and
true
and
not
to
become
a
set
of
airy
scenes
fantastically
coloured
by
our
later
time
must
be
continually
corrected
and
moderated
by
the
seeing
and
handling
of
if
the
west
of
europe
be
one
place
and
one
people
separate
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
then
that
unity
is
of
the
last
importance
to
us
and
that
it
is
so
the
wider
our
learning
the
more
certain
we
are
all
our
religion
and
custom
and
mode
of
thought
are
european
a
european
state
is
only
a
state
because
it
is
a
state
of
europe
and
the
demarcations
between
the
states
of
europe
are
only
dotted
lines
but
between
the
christian
and
the
the
boundary
is
hard
and
full
now
a
man
who
recognises
this
truth
will
ask
where
could
i
find
a
model
of
the
past
of
that
europe
in
what
place
could
i
find
the
best
single
collection
of
all
the
forms
which
european
energy
has
created
and
of
all
the
outward
symbols
in
which
its
soul
has
been
made
manifest
to
such
a
man
the
answer
should
be
given
will
find
these
things
better
in
the
town
of
than
in
any
other
place
a
man
asking
such
a
question
would
mean
to
travel
he
ought
to
travel
to
long
before
men
could
write
this
hill
which
was
the
first
dry
land
at
the
head
of
the
rhone
delta
beyond
the
early
which
the
river
was
pushing
out
into
the
sea
was
inhabited
by
our
ancestors
their
barbaric
huts
were
grouped
round
the
shelving
shore
their
axes
and
their
spindles
remain
when
thousands
of
years
later
the
greeks
pushed
northward
from
massilia
arles
was
the
first
great
corner
in
their
road
and
the
first
after
the
useless
deserts
that
separated
their
port
from
the
highway
of
the
rhone
valley
at
the
close
of
antiquity
rome
came
to
arles
in
the
beginning
of
her
expansion
and
the
strong
memories
of
rome
which
arles
still
holds
are
famous
every
traveller
has
heard
of
the
vast
unbroken
amphitheatre
and
the
ruined
temple
in
a
market
square
that
is
still
called
the
forum
they
are
famous
but
when
you
see
them
it
seems
to
you
that
they
should
be
more
famous
still
they
have
something
about
them
so
familiar
and
yet
so
unexpected
that
the
centuries
in
which
they
were
built
come
actively
before
you
the
city
of
arles
is
small
and
packed
a
man
may
spend
an
hour
in
it
instead
of
a
day
or
a
year
but
in
that
hour
he
can
receive
full
communion
with
antiquity
for
as
you
walk
along
the
tortuous
lane
between
high
houses
passing
on
either
hand
as
you
go
the
ornaments
of
every
age
you
turn
some
dirty
little
corner
or
other
and
come
suddenly
upon
the
titanic
arches
of
rome
there
are
the
huge
stones
which
appal
you
with
the
roman
weight
and
perpetuate
in
their
arrangement
an
order
that
has
modelled
the
world
they
lie
exact
and
mighty
they
are
unmoved
clamped
with
metal
a
little
worn
enduring
they
are
none
the
less
a
domestic
and
native
part
of
the
living
town
in
which
they
stand
you
pass
from
the
garden
of
a
house
that
was
built
in
your
time
and
you
see
familiarly
before
you
in
the
street
a
pedestal
and
a
column
they
are
two
thousand
years
old
you
read
a
placard
idly
upon
the
wall
the
placard
interests
you
it
deals
with
the
politics
of
the
place
or
with
the
army
but
the
wall
might
be
meaningless
you
look
more
closely
and
you
see
that
that
wall
was
raised
in
a
fashion
that
has
been
forgotten
since
the
antonines
and
these
realities
still
press
upon
you
revealed
and
lost
again
with
every
few
steps
you
walk
within
the
limited
circuit
of
the
town
rome
slowly
fell
asleep
the
sculpture
lost
its
power
something
barbaric
returned
you
may
see
that
decline
in
capitals
and
masks
still
embedded
in
buildings
of
the
fifth
century
the
sleep
grew
deeper
there
came
five
hundred
years
of
which
so
little
is
left
in
europe
that
paris
has
but
one
doubtful
tower
and
london
nothing
arles
still
preserves
its
relics
when
charlemagne
was
dead
and
christendom
almost
extinguished
the
barbarian
and
the
saracen
alternately
built
and
broke
against
a
keep
that
still
stands
and
that
is
still
so
strong
that
one
might
still
defend
it
it
is
unlit
it
is
a
dungeon
a
ponderous
menace
above
the
main
street
of
the
city
blind
and
enormous
it
is
the
very
time
it
comes
from
when
all
that
fear
and
anarchy
of
the
mind
had
passed
and
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
west
still
lived
a
dawn
broke
the
medieval
civilisation
began
to
sprout
vigorously
through
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
as
an
old
tree
sprouts
before
march
is
out
the
memorials
of
that
transition
are
common
enough
we
have
them
here
in
england
in
great
quantity
we
call
them
the
norman
architecture
a
peculiarly
vivid
relic
of
that
springtime
remains
at
arles
it
is
the
door
of
what
was
then
the
cathedral
the
door
of
trophimus
it
perpetuates
the
beginning
of
the
civilisation
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
that
civilisation
an
accident
which
has
all
the
force
of
a
particular
design
has
preserved
here
attached
to
this
same
church
another
complete
type
the
cloisters
of
this
same
church
of
trophimus
are
not
only
the
middle
ages
caught
and
made
eternal
they
are
also
a
progression
of
that
great
experiment
from
its
youth
to
its
sharp
close
you
come
into
these
cloisters
from
a
little
side
street
and
a
neglected
yard
which
give
you
no
hint
of
what
you
are
going
to
see
you
find
yourself
cut
off
at
once
and
put
separately
by
silence
inhabits
the
place
you
see
nothing
but
the
sky
beyond
the
border
of
the
low
roofs
one
old
man
there
who
can
not
read
or
write
and
is
all
but
blind
will
talk
to
you
of
the
rhone
then
as
you
go
round
the
arches
withershins
against
the
sun
in
which
way
lucky
progression
has
always
been
made
in
sacred
places
there
pass
you
one
after
the
other
the
epochs
of
the
middle
ages
for
each
group
of
arches
come
later
than
the
last
in
the
order
of
sculpture
and
the
sculptors
during
those
years
went
withershins
as
should
you
you
have
first
the
solemn
purpose
of
the
early
work
this
takes
on
neatness
of
detail
then
fineness
a
great
maturity
dignifies
all
the
northern
side
upon
the
western
you
already
see
that
spell
beneath
which
the
middle
ages
died
the
mystery
of
the
fifteenth
century
none
of
its
wickedness
but
all
its
final
vitality
is
there
you
see
in
fifty
details
the
last
attempt
of
our
race
to
grasp
and
permanently
to
retain
the
beautiful
when
the
circuit
is
completed
the
series
ends
abruptly
as
the
medieval
story
itself
ended
there
is
no
way
of
writing
or
of
telling
history
which
could
be
so
true
as
these
visions
are
arles
at
a
corner
of
the
great
main
road
of
the
empire
never
so
strong
as
to
destroy
nor
so
insignificant
as
to
cease
from
building
catching
the
earliest
roman
march
into
the
north
the
christian
advance
the
full
experience
of
the
invasions
retaining
in
a
vague
legend
the
memory
of
paul
drawing
in
after
the
long
trouble
the
new
life
that
followed
the
crusades
can
show
such
visions
better
i
think
than
rome
herself
can
show
them
the
griffin
a
specialist
told
me
once
in
ealing
that
no
inn
could
compare
with
the
griffin
a
fenland
inn
it
is
painted
green
he
said
and
stands
in
the
town
of
march
if
you
would
enjoy
the
griffin
you
must
ask
your
way
to
that
town
and
as
you
go
ask
also
for
the
griffin
for
many
who
may
not
have
heard
of
march
will
certainly
have
heard
of
the
griffin
so
i
set
out
at
once
for
the
fens
and
came
at
the
very
beginning
of
them
to
a
great
ditch
which
barred
all
further
progress
i
wandered
up
and
down
the
banks
for
an
hour
thinking
of
the
inn
when
i
met
a
man
who
was
sadder
and
more
silent
even
than
the
vast
level
and
lonely
land
in
which
he
lived
i
asked
him
how
i
should
cross
the
great
dyke
he
shook
his
head
and
said
he
did
not
know
i
asked
him
if
he
had
heard
of
the
griffin
but
he
said
no
i
broke
away
from
him
and
went
for
miles
along
the
bank
eastward
seeing
the
rare
trees
of
the
marshes
dwindling
in
the
distance
and
up
against
the
horizon
a
distant
spire
which
i
thought
might
be
the
spire
of
march
for
march
and
the
griffin
were
not
twenty
miles
away
and
still
the
great
ditch
stood
between
me
and
my
pilgrimage
these
dykes
of
the
fens
are
accursed
things
they
are
the
separation
of
friends
and
lovers
here
is
a
man
whose
crony
would
come
and
sit
by
his
fireside
at
evening
and
drink
with
him
a
custom
perhaps
of
twenty
years
standing
when
there
comes
another
man
from
another
part
armed
with
public
power
and
digs
between
them
a
trench
too
wide
to
leap
and
too
soft
to
ford
the
fens
are
full
of
such
tragedies
one
may
march
up
and
down
the
banks
all
day
without
finding
a
boat
and
as
for
bridges
there
are
none
except
indeed
the
bridges
which
the
railway
makes
for
the
railways
have
grown
to
be
as
powerful
as
the
landlords
or
the
brewers
and
can
go
across
this
country
where
they
choose
and
here
the
fens
are
typical
for
it
may
be
said
that
these
three
monopolies
the
landlords
the
railways
and
the
brewers
govern
england
but
at
last
at
a
place
called
oxlode
i
found
a
boat
and
the
news
that
just
beyond
lay
another
dyke
i
asked
where
that
could
be
crossed
but
the
ferryman
of
oxlode
did
not
know
he
pointed
two
houses
out
however
standing
close
together
out
of
the
plain
and
said
they
were
called
purles
bridge
and
that
i
would
do
well
to
try
there
but
when
i
reached
them
i
found
that
the
water
was
between
me
and
them
and
what
is
more
that
there
was
no
bridge
there
and
never
had
been
one
since
the
beginning
of
time
of
these
jests
the
fens
are
full
in
half
an
hour
a
man
came
out
of
one
of
the
houses
and
ferried
me
across
in
silence
i
asked
him
also
if
he
had
heard
of
the
griffin
he
laughed
and
shook
his
head
as
the
first
one
had
done
but
he
showed
me
a
little
way
off
the
village
of
monea
saying
that
the
people
of
that
place
knew
every
house
for
a
day
walk
around
so
i
trudged
to
monea
which
is
a
village
on
one
of
the
old
dry
islands
of
the
marsh
but
no
one
at
monea
knew
there
was
none
the
less
one
old
man
who
told
me
he
had
heard
the
name
and
his
advice
to
me
was
to
go
to
the
cross
roads
and
past
them
towards
march
and
then
to
ask
again
so
i
went
outwards
to
the
cross
roads
and
from
the
cross
roads
outward
again
it
seemed
without
end
a
similar
land
repeating
itself
for
ever
there
was
the
same
silence
the
same
completely
even
soil
the
same
deep
little
trenches
the
same
rare
distant
and
regular
rows
of
trees
since
it
was
useless
to
continue
thus
for
you
one
yard
was
as
good
as
twenty
miles
and
since
you
could
know
nothing
more
of
these
silences
even
if
i
were
to
give
you
every
inch
of
the
road
i
will
pass
at
once
to
the
moment
in
which
i
saw
a
baker
cart
catching
me
up
at
great
speed
the
man
inside
had
an
expression
of
irritable
poverty
i
did
not
promise
him
money
but
gave
it
him
then
he
took
me
aboard
and
rattled
on
with
me
by
his
side
i
had
by
this
time
a
suspicion
that
the
griffin
was
a
claustral
thing
and
a
mystery
not
to
be
blurted
out
i
knew
that
all
the
secrets
of
hermes
may
be
reached
by
careful
and
words
and
that
the
simplest
of
things
will
not
be
told
one
if
one
asks
too
precipitately
so
i
began
to
lay
siege
to
his
mind
by
the
method
of
dialogue
the
words
were
these
myself
this
land
wanted
draining
did
it
the
other
man
ah
myself
it
seems
to
be
pretty
well
drained
now
the
other
man
ugh
myself
i
mean
it
seems
dry
enough
the
other
man
it
was
drownded
only
last
winter
myself
it
looks
to
be
good
land
the
other
man
it
lousy
land
it
worth
nowt
myself
still
there
are
dark
bits
black
you
may
say
and
thereabouts
it
will
be
good
the
other
man
that
where
you
wrong
the
lighter
it
is
the
better
it
is
ah
that
where
many
of
go
wrong
myself
a
sort
of
loam
the
other
man
ugh
sand
his
it
blaws
away
with
a
blast
of
wind
longer
myself
though
full
of
then
you
set
your
drills
to
sow
deep
about
here
the
other
man
a
gesture
of
shoal
he
sighed
after
this
we
ceased
to
speak
to
each
other
for
several
miles
then
myself
who
owns
the
land
about
here
the
other
man
some
owns
parts
and
some
others
myself
pointing
to
an
enormous
field
with
a
little
new
house
in
the
who
owns
that
the
other
man
by
my
a
frenchman
he
grows
onions
now
if
you
know
little
of
england
and
of
the
temper
of
the
english
i
mean
of
of
the
english
people
and
not
of
the
with
which
you
associate
if
i
say
you
know
little
or
nothing
of
your
you
may
imagine
that
all
this
conversation
was
wasted
it
was
not
to
the
point
you
say
you
got
no
nearer
the
griffin
you
are
wrong
such
conversation
is
like
the
kneading
of
dough
or
the
mixing
of
mortar
it
mollifies
and
makes
ready
it
is
of
the
work
for
if
you
will
let
your
curse
you
and
grunt
at
you
and
if
you
will
but
talk
to
him
on
matters
which
he
knows
far
better
than
you
then
you
have
him
ready
at
the
end
so
had
i
this
man
for
i
asked
him
at
the
end
of
all
this
about
the
griffin
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
almost
with
intelligence
and
told
me
that
he
would
hand
me
over
in
the
next
village
to
a
man
who
was
going
through
march
so
he
did
and
the
horse
of
this
second
man
was
even
faster
than
that
of
the
baker
the
horses
of
the
fens
are
like
no
horses
in
the
world
for
speed
this
horse
was
years
old
yet
it
went
as
fast
as
though
all
that
tomfoolery
men
talk
about
progress
were
true
and
as
though
things
got
better
by
the
process
of
time
it
went
so
fast
that
one
might
imagine
it
at
winning
many
races
and
at
eighty
standing
beyond
all
comparison
or
competition
and
because
it
went
so
fast
i
went
hammering
right
through
the
town
of
march
before
i
had
time
to
learn
its
name
or
to
know
whither
i
was
driving
it
whirled
me
past
the
houses
and
out
into
the
country
beyond
only
when
i
had
pulled
up
two
miles
beyond
did
i
know
what
i
had
done
and
did
i
realise
that
i
had
missed
for
ever
one
of
those
pleasures
which
fleeting
as
they
are
are
all
that
is
to
be
discovered
in
human
life
it
went
so
fast
that
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
the
griffin
had
flashed
by
me
and
was
gone
yet
i
will
affirm
with
the
tongue
of
faith
that
it
is
the
noblest
house
of
call
in
the
fens
it
is
better
to
believe
than
to
handle
or
to
see
i
will
affirm
with
the
tongue
of
faith
that
the
griffin
is
as
it
were
the
captain
and
chief
of
these
plains
and
has
just
managed
to
touch
perfection
in
all
the
qualities
that
an
inn
should
achieve
i
am
speaking
not
of
what
i
know
by
the
doubtful
light
of
physical
experience
but
of
what
i
have
seen
with
the
inward
eye
and
felt
by
something
that
transcends
gross
taste
and
touch
low
rooms
of
my
repose
beams
of
comfort
and
great
age
drowsy
and
inhabiting
fires
made
for
companionship
you
also
beer
much
better
much
more
soft
than
the
beer
of
lesser
towns
beans
bacon
and
chicken
cooked
to
the
very
limit
of
excellence
port
drawn
from
barrels
which
the
simple
portuguese
had
sent
to
lynn
over
the
sea
and
honourable
lynn
without
admixture
had
sent
upon
a
cart
to
you
port
undefined
port
homogeneous
entirely
made
of
wine
you
also
beds
wooden
beds
with
curtains
around
them
feathers
for
sleeping
on
and
every
decent
thing
which
the
accursed
would
attempt
to
destroy
candles
i
trust
and
trust
is
more
perfect
than
proof
bread
made
if
it
be
possible
out
of
english
wheat
milk
drawn
most
certainly
from
english
cows
and
butter
worthy
of
the
pastures
of
england
all
around
oh
glory
to
the
fens
griffin
it
shall
not
be
said
that
i
have
not
enjoyed
you
there
is
a
modern
habit
i
know
of
gloom
and
men
without
faith
upon
every
side
recount
the
things
that
they
have
not
enjoyed
for
my
part
i
will
yield
to
no
such
habit
i
will
consider
that
i
have
more
perfectly
tasted
in
the
mind
that
which
may
have
been
denied
to
my
mere
body
and
i
will
produce
for
myself
and
others
a
greater
pleasure
than
any
pleasure
of
the
sense
i
will
do
what
the
poets
and
the
prophets
have
always
done
and
satisfy
myself
with
vision
and
who
knows
perhaps
by
this
the
griffin
of
the
idea
has
been
made
a
better
thing
if
that
were
possible
than
the
griffin
as
it
is
as
it
materially
stands
in
this
evil
and
uncertain
world
so
let
the
old
horse
go
by
and
snatch
me
from
this
chance
of
joy
he
has
not
taken
everything
in
his
flight
and
there
remains
something
in
spite
of
time
which
eats
us
all
up
and
yet
what
is
that
in
me
which
makes
me
regret
the
griffin
the
real
griffin
at
which
they
would
not
let
me
stay
the
griffin
painted
green
the
real
rooms
the
real
fire
the
material
beer
alas
for
mortality
something
in
me
still
clings
to
affections
temporal
and
mundane
england
my
desire
what
have
you
not
refused
me
the
first
day
march
i
very
well
remember
the
spring
breaking
ten
years
ago
in
lorraine
i
remember
it
better
far
than
i
shall
ever
remember
another
spring
because
one
of
those
petty
summits
of
emotion
that
seem
in
boyhood
like
the
peaks
of
the
world
was
before
me
we
were
going
off
to
camp
since
every
man
that
fires
guns
or
drives
them
in
france
that
is
some
hundred
thousand
and
more
at
any
one
time
and
taking
in
reserves
half
a
million
must
go
to
camp
in
his
time
and
that
more
than
once
it
seems
monstrous
that
a
boy
should
make
so
much
of
it
but
then
to
a
boy
six
months
is
a
little
lifetime
and
for
six
months
i
had
passed
through
that
great
annealing
fire
of
drill
which
stamps
and
moulds
the
french
people
putting
too
much
knowledge
and
bitterness
into
their
eyes
but
a
great
determination
into
their
gestures
and
a
trained
tenacity
into
the
methods
of
their
thought
to
me
also
this
fire
seemed
fiercer
and
more
transforming
because
until
the
day
when
they
had
marched
me
up
to
barracks
in
the
dark
and
the
rain
with
a
batch
of
recruits
i
had
known
nothing
but
the
easy
illusions
and
the
comfort
of
an
english
village
and
had
had
but
journeys
or
short
visits
to
teach
me
that
enduring
mystery
of
europe
the
french
temper
whose
aims
and
reticence
whose
hidden
enthusiasms
great
range
of
effort
divisions
defeats
and
resurrections
must
now
remain
the
principal
problem
before
my
mind
for
the
few
who
have
seen
this
sight
know
that
the
french
mind
is
the
pivot
on
which
europe
turns
i
had
come
into
the
regiment
faulty
in
my
grammar
and
doubtful
in
accent
ignorant
especially
of
those
things
which
in
every
civilisation
are
taken
for
granted
but
never
explained
in
full
i
was
ignorant
therefore
of
the
key
which
alone
can
open
that
civilisation
to
a
stranger
things
irksome
or
a
heavy
burden
to
the
young
men
of
my
age
born
and
brought
up
in
the
french
air
were
to
me
brought
up
with
englishmen
an
englishman
odious
and
bewildering
orders
that
i
but
half
comprehended
simple
phrases
that
seemed
charged
with
menace
boasting
a
habit
of
which
i
knew
little
coupled
with
a
fierce
and
as
it
were
expected
courage
that
seemed
ill
suited
to
boasting
and
certainly
unknown
outside
this
army
enormous
powers
of
endurance
in
men
whose
stature
my
english
training
had
taught
me
to
despise
a
habit
of
fighting
with
the
fists
coupled
with
a
curious
contempt
for
the
accident
of
individual
superiority
all
these
things
amazed
me
and
put
me
into
a
world
where
i
was
weeks
in
finding
my
feet
but
strangest
of
all
and
as
i
now
especially
believe
most
pregnant
with
meaning
for
the
future
was
to
find
the
inherited
experience
in
me
of
so
much
teaching
and
careful
habit
instinct
of
command
if
you
will
all
that
goes
to
make
what
we
call
in
western
europe
a
gentleman
put
at
the
orders
and
the
occasional
insult
of
a
hierarchy
of
office
many
of
whose
functionaries
were
peasants
and
artisans
stripes
on
the
arm
symbols
suddenly
became
of
overwhelming
value
what
i
had
been
made
with
so
much
care
in
an
english
public
school
was
here
thought
nothing
but
a
hindrance
and
an
absurdity
this
had
seemed
to
me
first
a
miracle
then
a
grievous
injustice
then
most
unpractical
and
at
last
like
one
that
sees
the
answer
to
a
riddle
i
saw
when
i
had
long
lost
my
manners
and
ceased
to
care
for
refinements
that
the
french
were
attempting
a
generation
before
any
others
in
the
world
to
establish
an
army
that
should
be
a
mere
army
and
in
which
a
living
man
counted
only
as
one
numbered
man
whether
that
experiment
will
hold
or
not
i
can
not
tell
it
shocks
the
refinement
of
the
whole
west
of
europe
it
seems
monstrous
to
the
aristocratic
organisation
of
germany
it
jars
in
france
also
with
the
traditions
of
that
decent
elder
class
of
whom
so
many
still
remain
to
guide
the
republic
and
in
whose
social
philosophy
the
segregation
of
a
directing
class
has
been
hitherto
a
dogma
but
soon
i
cared
little
whether
that
experiment
was
to
succeed
or
no
in
its
final
effort
or
whether
the
french
were
to
perfect
a
democracy
where
wealth
has
one
vast
experience
of
its
own
artificiality
or
to
fail
the
intellectual
interest
of
such
an
experiment
when
once
i
seized
it
drove
out
every
other
feeling
i
became
like
a
man
who
has
thoroughly
awaked
from
a
long
sleep
and
finds
that
in
sleep
he
has
been
taken
overseas
i
merged
into
the
great
system
whose
wheels
and
grindings
had
at
first
astonished
or
disgusted
me
and
i
found
that
they
had
made
of
me
what
they
meant
to
make
i
cared
more
for
guns
than
for
books
i
now
obeyed
by
instinct
not
men
but
symbols
of
authority
no
comfortable
fallacy
remained
it
no
longer
seemed
strange
that
my
captain
was
a
man
promoted
from
the
ranks
that
one
of
my
lieutenants
was
an
alsatian
charity
boy
and
the
other
a
rich
fellow
mixed
up
with
that
the
sergeant
of
my
piece
should
be
a
poor
young
noble
the
wheeler
of
no
a
wealthy
and
very
vulgar
chemist
son
the
man
in
the
next
bed
my
ancient
as
they
say
in
that
service
a
cook
of
some
skill
and
my
bombardier
a
mild
young
farmer
i
thought
only
in
terms
of
the
artillery
i
could
judge
men
from
their
aptitude
alone
and
in
me
i
suppose
were
accomplished
many
things
one
of
danton
dreams
one
of
just
prophecies
the
fulfilment
also
of
what
a
hundred
brains
had
silently
determined
twenty
years
before
when
the
staff
gave
up
their
swords
outside
metz
the
army
and
the
kind
of
army
of
which
chanzy
had
said
in
the
first
breath
of
the
armistice
a
man
who
forgets
it
should
be
hanged
but
a
man
who
speaks
of
it
before
its
time
should
be
shot
with
the
honours
of
his
rank
all
this
had
happened
to
me
in
especial
in
that
up
in
the
eastern
hills
and
to
thirty
thousand
others
that
year
in
their
separate
crucibles
in
the
process
things
had
passed
which
would
seem
to
you
incredible
if
i
wrote
them
all
down
i
cared
little
in
what
vessel
i
ate
or
whether
i
had
to
tear
meat
with
my
fingers
i
could
march
in
reserve
more
than
twenty
miles
a
day
for
day
upon
day
i
knew
all
about
my
horses
i
could
sweep
wash
make
a
bed
clean
kit
cook
a
little
tidy
a
stable
turn
to
entrenching
for
emplacement
take
a
place
at
lifting
a
gun
or
changing
a
wheel
i
took
change
with
a
gunner
and
could
point
well
and
all
this
was
not
learnt
save
under
a
grinding
pressure
of
authority
and
harshness
without
which
in
one
whole
life
i
suppose
one
would
never
properly
have
learnt
a
half
of
these
things
at
least
not
to
do
them
so
readily
or
in
such
unison
or
on
so
definite
a
plan
but
what
will
seem
astonishing
to
our
critics
and
verbalists
with
all
this
there
increased
the
power
or
perhaps
it
was
but
the
desire
to
express
the
greatest
thoughts
newer
and
keener
things
i
began
to
understand
de
vigny
when
he
wrote
if
a
man
despairs
of
becoming
a
poet
let
him
carry
his
pack
and
march
in
the
ranks
thus
the
great
hills
that
border
the
moselle
the
distant
frontier
the
vast
plain
which
is
they
say
to
be
a
battlefield
and
which
lay
five
hundred
feet
sheer
below
me
the
far
guns
when
they
were
practising
at
metz
the
awful
strength
of
columns
on
the
march
moved
me
the
sky
also
grew
more
wonderful
and
i
noticed
living
things
the
middle
ages
of
which
till
then
i
had
had
but
troubling
visions
rose
up
and
took
flesh
in
the
old
town
on
the
rare
winter
evenings
when
i
had
purchased
the
leisure
to
leave
quarters
by
some
excessive
toil
a
man
could
feel
france
going
by
it
was
at
the
end
of
these
six
months
when
there
was
no
more
darkness
at
and
when
the
bitter
cold
that
had
frozen
us
all
winter
was
half
forgotten
that
the
spring
brought
me
this
excellent
news
earlier
than
i
had
dared
to
expect
it
the
news
that
sounds
to
a
recruit
half
as
good
as
active
service
we
were
going
to
march
and
go
off
right
away
westward
over
half
a
dozen
horizons
till
we
could
see
the
real
thing
at
chalons
and
with
this
news
the
world
seemed
recreated
seven
times
that
winter
we
had
been
mobilised
four
times
in
the
dead
of
the
night
once
at
midday
once
at
evening
and
once
at
dawn
seven
times
we
had
started
down
the
wide
metz
road
hoping
in
some
vague
way
that
they
would
do
something
with
us
and
give
us
at
least
some
manoeuvres
and
seven
times
we
had
marched
back
to
barracks
to
undo
all
that
serious
packing
and
to
return
to
routine
once
for
a
week
in
february
the
french
and
german
governments
or
more
probably
two
minor
permanent
officials
took
it
into
their
silly
heads
that
there
was
some
danger
of
war
we
packed
our
campaign
saddles
every
night
and
put
them
on
the
pegs
behind
the
stalls
we
had
the
emergency
rations
served
out
and
for
two
days
in
the
middle
of
that
time
we
had
slept
ready
but
nothing
came
of
it
now
at
least
we
were
off
to
play
a
little
at
the
game
whose
theory
we
had
learnt
so
wearily
and
the
way
i
first
knew
it
would
easily
fill
a
book
if
it
were
told
as
it
should
be
with
every
detail
and
its
meaning
unrolled
and
with
every
joy
described
as
it
is
i
must
put
it
in
ten
lines
garnon
a
sergeant
three
others
and
i
were
sent
out
one
patrol
out
of
fifty
to
go
round
and
see
the
reserve
horses
on
the
farms
that
was
delight
enough
to
have
a
vigorous
windy
morning
with
the
clouds
large
and
white
and
in
a
clear
sky
and
to
mix
with
the
first
grain
of
the
year
out
of
the
we
took
the
round
they
gave
us
along
the
base
of
the
high
hills
we
got
our
papers
signed
at
the
different
stables
we
noted
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
and
their
numbers
a
good
woman
at
a
large
farm
gave
us
food
of
eggs
and
onions
and
at
noon
we
turned
to
get
back
to
quarters
for
the
grooming
everything
then
was
very
well
to
have
ridden
out
alone
without
the
second
horse
and
with
no
horrible
great
pole
to
crush
leg
and
be
free
though
we
missed
it
of
the
clank
of
the
guns
we
felt
like
gentlemen
at
ease
and
were
speaking
grandly
to
each
other
when
i
heard
garnon
say
to
the
senior
of
us
a
word
that
made
things
seem
better
still
for
he
pointed
out
to
a
long
blue
line
beyond
domremy
and
overhanging
the
house
of
joan
of
arc
saying
that
the
town
lay
there
what
town
said
i
to
my
ancient
and
my
ancient
instead
of
answering
simply
took
five
minutes
to
explain
to
me
how
a
recruit
could
not
know
that
the
round
of
the
reserve
horses
came
next
before
camp
and
that
this
town
away
on
the
western
ridge
was
the
first
upon
the
road
then
my
mind
filled
with
distances
and
i
was
overjoyed
saving
for
this
one
thing
that
i
had
but
two
francs
and
a
few
coppers
left
and
that
i
was
not
in
reach
of
more
when
we
had
ridden
in
saluted
and
reported
at
the
guard
we
saw
the
guns
drawn
up
in
line
at
the
end
of
the
yard
and
we
went
into
grooming
and
ate
and
slept
hardly
waiting
for
the
morning
and
the
long
regimental
call
before
the
réveillé
the
notes
that
always
mean
the
high
road
for
an
army
and
that
are
as
old
as
fontenoy
that
next
morning
they
woke
us
all
before
dawn
long
before
dawn
the
sky
was
still
keen
and
there
was
not
even
a
promise
of
morning
in
the
air
nor
the
least
faintness
in
the
eastern
stars
they
twinkled
right
on
the
edges
of
the
world
over
the
far
woods
of
lorraine
beyond
the
hollow
wherein
lay
the
town
it
was
even
cold
like
winter
as
we
harnessed
and
i
remember
the
night
air
catching
me
in
the
face
as
i
staggered
from
the
with
my
campaign
saddle
and
the
traces
and
the
girths
and
the
saddle
cloth
and
all
the
great
weight
that
i
had
to
put
upon
my
horses
we
stood
in
the
long
stables
all
together
very
hurriedly
saddling
and
bridling
and
knotting
up
the
traces
behind
a
few
lanterns
gave
us
an
imperfect
light
we
hurried
because
it
was
a
pride
to
be
the
first
battery
and
in
the
french
service
rightly
or
wrongly
everything
in
the
artillery
is
made
for
speed
and
to
speed
everything
is
sacrificed
so
we
made
ready
in
the
stable
and
brought
our
horses
out
in
order
before
the
guns
in
the
open
square
of
quarters
the
high
plateau
on
which
the
barracks
stood
was
touched
with
a
last
late
frost
and
the
horses
coming
out
of
the
warm
stables
bore
the
change
ill
lifting
their
heads
and
stamping
a
man
could
not
leave
the
leaders
for
a
moment
and
while
the
chains
were
hooked
on
even
my
middle
horses
were
restive
and
had
to
be
held
my
hands
stiffened
at
the
reins
and
i
tried
to
soothe
both
my
beasts
as
the
lantern
went
up
and
down
wherever
the
work
was
being
done
they
quieted
when
the
light
was
taken
round
behind
by
the
tumbrils
where
two
men
were
tying
on
the
great
sack
of
oats
exactly
as
though
we
were
going
on
campaign
these
two
horses
of
mine
were
called
pacte
and
basilique
basilique
was
saddled
a
slow
beast
full
of
strength
and
sympathy
but
stupid
and
given
to
sudden
fears
pacte
was
the
led
horse
and
had
never
heard
guns
it
was
prophesied
that
when
first
i
should
have
to
hold
him
in
camp
when
we
were
practising
he
would
break
everything
near
him
and
either
kill
me
or
get
me
cells
but
i
did
not
believe
these
prophecies
having
found
my
ancient
and
all
men
too
often
to
be
liars
fond
of
frightening
the
younger
recruits
meanwhile
pacte
stood
in
the
sharp
night
impatient
and
shook
his
harness
everything
had
been
quickly
ordered
we
filed
out
of
quarters
passed
the
lamp
of
the
guard
and
saw
huddled
there
the
dozen
or
so
that
were
left
behind
while
we
were
off
to
better
things
then
a
cry
at
the
head
of
the
column
was
caught
up
all
along
its
length
and
we
trotted
the
metal
of
shoes
and
rang
upon
the
road
and
i
felt
as
a
man
feels
on
a
ship
when
it
leaves
harbour
for
great
discoveries
we
had
climbed
the
steep
bank
above
martin
and
were
on
the
highest
ridge
of
land
dominating
the
plain
when
the
sky
first
felt
the
approach
of
the
sun
our
backs
were
to
the
east
but
the
horizon
before
us
caught
a
reflection
of
the
dawn
the
woods
lost
their
mystery
and
one
found
oneself
marching
in
a
partly
cultivated
open
space
with
a
forest
all
around
the
road
ran
straight
for
miles
like
an
arrow
and
stretched
swarmingly
along
it
was
the
interminable
line
of
guns
but
with
the
full
daylight
and
after
the
sun
had
risen
in
a
mist
they
deployed
us
out
of
column
into
a
wide
front
on
a
great
heath
in
the
forest
and
we
halted
there
we
brewed
coffee
not
by
batteries
but
gun
by
gun
warmed
by
this
little
meal
mere
coffee
without
sugar
or
milk
but
with
a
hunk
left
over
from
yesterday
bread
and
drawn
stale
from
haversack
the
armies
of
the
republic
and
of
napoleon
often
fought
all
day
upon
such
sustenance
and
even
now
as
you
will
see
the
french
do
not
really
eat
till
a
march
is
over
and
this
may
be
a
great
advantage
in
warfare
warmed
i
say
by
this
little
meal
and
very
much
refreshed
by
the
sun
and
the
increasing
merriment
of
morning
we
heard
the
first
and
then
the
shouted
order
to
mount
we
did
not
form
one
column
again
we
went
off
at
intervals
by
batteries
and
the
reason
of
this
was
soon
clear
for
on
getting
to
a
place
where
four
roads
met
some
took
one
and
some
took
another
the
object
being
to
split
up
the
unwieldy
train
of
guns
with
all
their
waggons
and
forges
into
a
number
of
smaller
groups
marching
by
ways
more
or
less
parallel
towards
the
same
goal
and
my
battery
was
left
separate
and
went
at
last
along
a
lane
that
ran
through
pasture
land
in
a
valley
the
villages
were
already
awake
and
the
mist
was
all
but
lifted
from
the
meadows
when
we
heard
men
singing
in
chorus
in
front
of
us
some
way
off
these
were
the
gunners
that
had
left
long
before
us
and
had
gone
on
forward
afoot
for
in
the
french
artillery
it
is
a
maxim
for
all
i
know
common
to
all
others
if
other
artilleries
are
wise
that
you
should
weight
your
limber
and
therefore
your
horses
with
useful
things
alone
and
as
gunners
are
useful
only
to
fire
guns
they
are
not
carried
save
into
action
or
when
some
great
rapidity
of
movement
is
desired
i
do
indeed
remember
one
case
when
it
was
thought
necessary
to
send
a
group
of
batteries
during
the
manoeuvres
right
over
from
the
left
to
the
right
of
a
very
long
position
which
our
division
was
occupying
on
the
crest
of
the
argonne
there
was
the
greatest
need
for
haste
and
we
packed
the
gunners
on
to
the
limber
there
were
no
seats
on
the
gun
in
the
old
type
there
are
now
and
galloped
all
the
way
down
the
road
and
put
the
guns
in
action
with
the
horses
still
panting
and
exhausted
by
that
extra
weight
carried
at
such
a
speed
and
for
such
a
distance
but
on
the
march
i
say
again
we
send
the
gunners
forward
and
not
only
the
gunners
but
as
you
shall
hear
when
we
come
to
commercy
a
reserve
of
drivers
also
we
send
them
forward
an
hour
or
two
before
the
guns
start
we
catch
them
up
with
the
guns
on
the
road
they
file
up
to
let
us
pass
and
commonly
salute
us
by
way
of
formality
and
ceremony
then
they
come
into
the
town
of
the
halt
an
hour
or
two
after
we
have
reached
it
so
here
in
this
silent
and
delightful
valley
through
which
ran
a
river
which
may
have
been
the
meuse
or
may
have
been
a
tributary
only
we
caught
up
our
gunners
their
song
ceased
they
were
lined
up
along
the
road
and
not
till
we
were
passed
were
they
given
a
little
halt
and
repose
but
when
we
had
gone
past
with
a
huge
clattering
and
dust
the
bombardier
of
my
piece
who
was
a
very
kindly
man
a
young
farmer
and
who
happened
to
be
riding
abreast
of
my
horses
pointed
them
out
to
me
behind
us
at
a
turning
in
the
road
they
were
taking
that
five
rest
which
the
french
have
borrowed
from
the
germans
and
which
comes
at
the
end
of
every
hour
on
the
march
they
had
thrown
down
their
knapsacks
and
were
lying
flat
taking
their
ease
i
could
not
long
look
backwards
but
a
very
little
time
after
when
we
had
already
gained
nearly
half
a
mile
upon
them
we
again
heard
the
noise
of
their
singing
and
knew
that
they
had
reshouldered
their
heavy
packs
and
this
pack
is
the
same
in
every
unmounted
branch
of
the
service
and
is
the
heaviest
thing
i
believe
that
has
been
carried
by
infantry
since
the
romans
it
was
not
yet
noon
and
extremely
hot
for
the
time
of
year
and
for
the
coldness
of
the
preceding
night
when
they
halted
us
at
a
place
where
the
road
bent
round
in
a
curve
and
went
down
a
little
hollow
there
we
dismounted
and
cleaned
things
up
a
little
before
getting
into
the
town
where
we
were
to
find
what
the
french
call
an
that
is
the
town
at
which
one
halts
at
the
end
of
one
march
and
the
word
is
also
used
for
the
length
of
a
march
itself
it
is
not
in
general
orders
to
clean
up
in
this
way
before
coming
in
and
there
were
some
commanders
who
were
never
more
pleased
than
when
they
could
bring
their
battery
into
town
covered
with
dust
and
the
horses
steaming
and
the
men
haggard
for
this
they
thought
to
be
evidence
of
a
workmanlike
spirit
but
our
colonel
had
given
very
contrary
orders
to
the
annoyance
of
our
captain
a
man
risen
from
the
ranks
who
loved
the
guns
and
hated
finery
then
we
went
at
a
walk
the
two
trumpets
of
the
battery
sounding
the
call
which
is
known
among
french
gunners
as
the
eighty
hunters
because
the
words
to
it
are
which
words
by
their
metallic
noise
and
monotony
exactly
express
the
long
call
that
announces
the
approach
of
guns
we
went
right
through
the
town
the
name
of
which
is
commercy
and
the
boys
looked
at
us
with
pride
not
knowing
how
hateful
they
would
find
the
service
when
once
they
were
in
for
its
grind
and
hopelessness
but
then
for
that
matter
i
did
not
know
myself
with
what
great
pleasure
i
should
look
back
upon
it
ten
years
after
moreover
nobody
knows
beforehand
whether
he
will
like
a
thing
or
not
and
there
is
the
end
of
it
we
formed
a
park
in
the
principal
place
of
the
town
there
were
appointed
two
sentinels
to
do
duty
until
the
arrival
of
the
gunners
who
should
relieve
them
and
mount
a
proper
guard
and
then
we
were
marched
off
to
be
shown
our
various
quarters
for
before
a
french
regiment
arrives
at
a
town
others
have
ridden
forward
and
have
marked
in
chalk
upon
the
doors
how
many
men
and
how
many
horses
are
to
be
quartered
here
or
there
and
my
quarters
were
in
a
great
barn
with
a
very
high
roof
but
my
ancient
upon
whom
i
depended
for
advice
was
quartered
in
a
house
and
i
was
therefore
lonely
we
groomed
our
horses
ate
our
great
midday
meal
and
were
free
for
a
couple
of
hours
to
wander
about
the
place
it
is
a
garrison
and
at
that
time
it
was
full
of
cavalry
with
whom
we
fraternised
but
the
experiment
was
a
trifle
dangerous
for
there
is
always
a
risk
of
a
quarrel
when
regiments
meet
as
there
is
with
two
dogs
or
two
of
any
other
kind
of
lively
things
then
came
the
evening
and
very
early
before
it
was
dark
i
was
asleep
in
my
clothes
in
some
straw
very
warm
but
i
was
so
lazy
that
i
had
not
even
taken
off
my
belt
or
sword
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
first
marching
the
of
the
wash
the
town
of
wisbeach
is
very
like
the
town
of
boston
it
stands
upon
a
river
which
is
very
narrow
and
which
curves
and
in
which
there
rises
and
falls
a
most
considerable
tide
and
which
is
bounded
by
slimy
wooden
sides
here
as
at
boston
the
boats
can
not
turn
round
if
they
come
in
frontways
they
have
to
go
out
backwards
like
mevagissey
bees
an
awkward
harbour
as
i
sat
there
in
the
white
hart
waiting
for
steak
and
onions
i
read
in
a
book
descriptive
of
the
place
that
a
whale
had
come
to
wisbeach
once
and
i
considered
that
a
whale
coming
up
to
wisbeach
on
a
tide
would
certainly
stay
there
not
indeed
for
the
delights
of
the
town
of
which
i
say
nothing
but
because
there
would
be
no
room
to
turn
round
and
a
whale
can
not
swim
backwards
the
only
fish
that
can
swim
backwards
is
an
eel
this
i
have
proved
by
observation
and
i
challenge
any
fisherman
to
deny
it
so
much
for
wisbeach
which
stands
upon
the
river
nene
or
nen
which
is
the
last
of
the
towns
defended
by
the
old
which
is
the
third
of
the
fen
ports
the
other
two
being
boston
and
lynn
which
is
served
by
two
lines
of
railway
and
which
has
two
stations
very
early
next
morning
and
by
one
of
these
stations
another
man
and
i
took
train
to
a
bridge
called
sutton
bridge
where
one
can
cross
the
river
nen
and
where
according
to
the
map
one
can
see
both
the
the
old
and
the
new
it
was
my
plan
to
walk
along
the
shore
of
the
wash
right
across
the
flats
to
lynn
and
so
at
last
perhaps
comprehend
the
nature
of
this
curious
land
when
i
got
to
sutton
bridge
i
discovered
it
to
be
a
monstrous
thing
of
iron
standing
poised
upon
a
huge
pivot
in
it
bore
the
railway
and
the
road
together
it
was
that
kind
of
triumphant
engineering
which
once
you
saw
only
in
england
but
which
now
you
will
see
all
over
the
world
it
was
designed
to
swing
open
on
its
central
pivot
to
let
boats
go
up
the
river
nen
and
then
to
come
back
exactly
to
its
place
with
a
clang
but
when
we
got
to
it
we
found
it
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
it
was
twisted
just
so
much
that
the
two
parts
of
the
roads
the
road
on
the
bridge
and
the
road
on
land
did
not
join
was
a
boat
about
to
pass
no
why
was
it
open
thus
a
man
was
cleaning
it
the
bridge
is
not
as
big
as
the
tower
bridge
but
it
is
very
big
and
the
man
was
cleaning
it
with
a
little
rag
he
was
cleaning
the
under
part
the
mechanisms
and
contraptions
that
can
only
be
got
at
when
the
bridge
is
thus
ajar
he
cleaned
without
haste
and
without
exertion
and
as
i
watched
him
i
considered
the
mightiness
of
the
works
of
man
contrasted
with
his
puny
frame
i
also
asked
him
when
i
should
pass
but
he
answered
nothing
as
we
thus
waited
men
gathered
upon
either
side
men
of
all
characters
and
kinds
men
holding
bicycles
men
in
carts
afoot
on
horseback
vigorous
men
and
feeble
old
men
women
also
and
little
children
and
youths
witless
of
life
and
innocent
young
girls
they
gathered
and
increased
they
became
as
numerous
as
leaves
they
stretched
out
their
hands
in
a
desire
for
the
further
shore
but
the
river
ran
between
then
as
being
next
the
gate
i
again
called
out
when
might
we
pass
a
fenland
man
who
was
on
duty
there
doing
nothing
said
i
could
pass
when
the
bridge
was
shut
again
i
said
when
would
that
be
he
said
could
i
not
see
that
the
man
was
cleaning
the
bridge
i
said
that
contrasting
the
bridge
with
him
and
his
little
rag
he
might
go
on
from
now
to
the
disestablishment
of
the
english
church
before
he
had
done
but
as
for
me
i
desired
to
cross
and
so
did
all
that
multitude
without
grace
they
shut
the
bridge
for
us
the
gate
opened
of
itself
and
in
a
great
clamorous
flood
like
an
army
released
from
a
siege
we
poured
over
all
of
us
rejoicing
into
wringland
for
so
is
called
this
flat
reclaimed
land
which
stands
isolated
between
the
nen
and
the
ouse
was
i
not
right
in
saying
when
i
wrote
about
ely
that
the
corner
of
a
corner
of
england
is
infinite
and
can
never
be
exhausted
along
the
cut
which
takes
the
nen
out
to
sea
then
across
some
level
fields
and
jumping
a
ditch
or
two
one
gets
to
the
straight
steep
and
high
dyke
which
protects
the
dry
land
and
cuts
off
the
plough
from
the
sea
marshes
when
i
had
climbed
it
and
looked
out
over
endless
flats
to
the
sails
under
the
brune
of
the
horizon
i
understood
the
fens
nowhere
that
i
have
been
to
in
the
world
does
the
land
fade
into
the
sea
so
inconspicuously
the
coasts
of
western
england
are
like
the
death
of
a
western
man
in
battle
violent
and
heroic
the
land
dares
all
and
plunges
into
a
noisy
sea
this
coast
of
eastern
england
is
like
the
death
of
one
of
these
eastern
merchants
here
lethargic
drugged
with
ease
the
dry
land
slips
and
wallows
into
a
quiet
very
shallow
water
confused
with
a
yellow
thickness
and
brackish
with
the
weight
of
inland
water
behind
i
have
heard
of
the
great
lakes
especially
of
the
marshes
at
the
mouth
of
the
volga
in
the
caspian
where
the
two
elements
are
for
miles
indistinguishable
and
where
no
one
can
speak
of
a
shore
but
here
the
thing
is
more
marvellous
because
it
is
the
true
sea
you
have
i
say
the
true
sea
with
great
tides
and
bearing
ships
and
seaports
to
which
the
ships
can
go
and
on
the
other
side
you
have
inhabited
an
ancient
land
there
should
be
a
demarcation
between
them
a
tide
mark
or
limit
there
is
nothing
you
can
not
say
where
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
one
does
not
understand
the
fens
until
one
has
seen
that
shore
the
sand
and
the
mud
commingle
the
mud
takes
on
little
tufts
of
salt
grass
barely
growing
under
the
harsh
wind
the
marsh
is
cut
and
wasted
into
little
islands
covered
at
every
high
tide
except
perhaps
the
extreme
of
the
neaps
down
on
that
level
out
from
the
dyke
to
the
uncertain
line
of
the
water
you
can
not
walk
a
hundred
yards
without
having
to
cross
a
channel
more
or
less
deep
a
channel
which
the
working
of
the
muddy
tides
has
scoured
up
into
the
silt
and
ooze
of
the
sodden
land
these
channels
are
yards
deep
in
slime
and
they
ramify
like
the
twisted
shoots
of
an
old
vine
were
you
to
make
a
map
of
them
as
they
engrave
this
desolate
waste
it
would
look
like
the
fine
tortuous
cracks
that
show
upon
antique
enamel
or
the
wandering
of
threads
blown
at
random
on
a
woman
by
the
wind
there
are
miles
and
miles
of
it
right
up
to
the
embankment
the
great
and
old
which
protects
the
houses
of
men
you
have
but
to
eliminate
that
embankment
to
imagine
what
the
whole
countryside
must
have
been
like
before
it
was
raised
and
the
meaning
of
the
fens
becomes
clear
to
you
the
fens
were
long
ago
but
the
continuation
inland
of
this
the
tide
channels
of
the
marsh
were
all
of
one
kind
though
they
differed
so
much
in
size
some
of
these
channels
were
small
without
name
some
a
little
larger
and
these
had
a
local
name
others
were
a
little
larger
again
and
worthy
to
be
called
rivers
the
ouse
the
nen
the
welland
the
glen
the
witham
but
large
or
small
they
were
nothing
all
of
them
but
the
scouring
of
in
the
light
and
sodden
slime
it
was
the
high
tide
that
drowned
all
this
land
the
low
tide
that
drained
it
and
wherever
a
patch
could
be
found
just
above
the
influence
of
the
tide
or
near
enough
to
some
main
channel
for
the
rush
and
swirl
of
the
water
to
drain
the
island
there
the
villages
grew
wherever
such
a
patch
could
be
found
men
built
their
first
homes
sometimes
before
men
civic
came
the
holy
hermits
but
man
religious
or
greedy
or
just
wandering
crept
in
after
each
inundation
and
began
to
tame
the
water
and
spread
out
even
here
his
slow
interminable
conquest
so
wisbeach
so
march
so
boston
grew
and
so
the
oldest
of
them
all
the
isle
of
ely
the
nature
of
the
country
a
nature
at
which
i
had
but
guessed
whenever
before
this
i
had
wandered
through
it
and
which
i
had
puzzled
at
as
i
viewed
its
mere
history
was
quite
clear
now
that
i
stood
upon
the
wall
that
fenced
it
in
from
the
salt
water
it
was
easy
to
see
not
only
what
judgments
had
been
mistaken
but
also
in
what
way
they
had
erred
one
could
see
why
and
how
the
homelessness
of
the
place
had
been
exaggerated
one
could
see
how
the
level
was
just
above
not
as
in
holland
below
the
mean
of
the
tides
one
could
discover
the
manner
in
which
communication
from
the
open
sea
was
possible
the
deeps
lead
out
through
the
sand
they
are
but
continuations
under
water
of
that
which
is
the
note
of
all
the
place
inland
and
out
far
out
we
could
see
the
continuation
of
the
and
at
their
mouths
far
into
the
sea
the
sails
a
man
sounding
as
he
went
before
the
wind
was
led
by
force
into
the
main
channels
he
was
shepherded
into
lynn
river
or
wisbeach
river
or
boston
river
according
as
he
found
the
water
shoaler
to
one
side
or
other
of
his
boat
so
must
have
come
the
first
saxon
pirates
from
the
mainland
so
hundreds
of
years
later
came
here
our
portion
of
that
swarm
of
pagans
which
all
but
destroyed
europe
so
centuries
before
either
of
them
in
a
time
of
which
there
is
no
record
the
ignorant
seafaring
men
from
the
east
and
the
north
must
have
come
right
up
into
our
island
as
the
sea
itself
creeps
right
up
into
the
land
through
these
curious
crevices
and
draughts
in
the
fenland
wall
men
at
least
the
men
of
our
race
have
made
everything
for
themselves
and
they
will
never
cease
they
continue
to
extend
and
possess
it
is
not
only
the
architecture
it
is
the
very
landscape
of
europe
which
has
been
made
by
europeans
in
what
way
did
we
begin
to
form
this
difficult
place
which
is
neither
earth
nor
water
and
in
which
we
might
have
despaired
it
was
conquered
by
human
artifice
of
course
somewhat
as
frisia
and
the
netherlands
and
as
we
may
believe
the
great
bay
of
the
cotentin
were
conquered
but
it
has
certain
special
characters
of
its
own
and
these
again
are
due
to
the
value
in
this
place
of
the
tides
and
to
the
absence
of
those
natural
dykes
of
sand
which
were
a
thousand
years
ago
the
beginnings
of
holland
two
methods
working
side
by
side
have
from
the
beginning
of
human
habitation
reclaimed
the
fens
the
first
has
been
the
canalisation
the
fencing
in
of
the
tideways
the
second
has
been
the
banking
out
of
the
general
sea
the
spring
tides
covered
much
of
this
land
and
when
they
retired
left
it
drowned
against
their
universal
advancing
sheet
of
water
a
bank
could
be
made
such
a
bank
cut
off
the
invasion
of
the
hundreds
of
runnels
small
and
great
by
which
the
more
ordinary
tides
that
could
not
cover
the
surface
had
yet
crept
into
the
soil
and
soaked
it
through
when
such
a
bank
had
been
built
gates
as
it
were
permitted
the
water
to
spend
its
force
and
also
to
use
its
ebb
and
flow
for
the
draining
of
the
land
beyond
the
gates
which
let
the
tide
pour
up
and
down
the
main
ways
became
the
new
mouths
of
the
main
rivers
inland
the
courses
of
the
rivers
which
now
took
all
the
sea
and
thus
became
prodigious
were
carefully
guarded
even
before
trenches
were
dug
to
drain
the
fields
around
earth
was
thrown
up
on
either
side
of
the
rivers
to
confine
them
each
to
one
permanent
channel
nor
did
the
level
of
the
rivers
rise
or
their
beds
gets
clogged
the
strength
of
the
tide
sufficed
for
the
deepening
of
their
channels
into
the
rivers
so
fortified
the
other
waterways
of
the
fens
were
conducted
by
these
methods
alone
much
of
the
land
was
rendered
habitable
and
subject
to
the
plough
probably
these
methods
were
enough
to
make
it
all
it
was
in
the
middle
ages
it
was
only
far
later
almost
in
our
own
time
that
water
was
gathered
by
trenches
in
the
lowland
beneath
the
rivers
and
pumped
out
artificially
with
mills
nor
is
it
quite
certain
even
now
that
this
method
borrowed
from
holland
is
the
best
for
the
land
as
i
have
said
is
above
and
not
below
the
sea
of
these
words
whose
tradition
is
immemorial
the
greatest
of
course
are
the
perhaps
the
came
first
but
the
great
bank
which
limited
and
protected
the
land
against
the
sea
is
also
older
than
any
history
it
is
called
roman
and
relics
of
rome
have
been
found
in
it
but
it
has
not
the
characteristic
of
roman
work
it
runs
upon
no
regular
lines
its
contour
is
curved
and
variable
it
is
surely
far
older
than
the
roman
occupation
earth
heaped
and
beaten
hard
is
the
most
enduring
of
things
the
tumuli
all
over
england
have
outlasted
even
the
monoliths
and
the
great
defensive
mounds
at
norwich
and
at
oxford
are
stronger
and
clearer
cut
than
anything
that
the
middle
ages
have
left
this
bank
which
first
made
fenland
still
stands
most
conspicuous
you
may
follow
it
from
the
nene
above
sutton
bridge
right
over
to
lynn
river
and
again
northward
from
sutton
bridge
or
rather
from
the
ferry
above
it
right
round
long
sutton
and
holbeach
and
by
forsdyke
bridge
and
swyneshead
everywhere
it
encloses
and
protects
the
old
parishes
and
everywhere
seaward
of
it
the
names
of
the
fields
mark
the
newest
of
endeavours
we
returned
from
a
long
wandering
upon
the
desolate
edges
of
the
sea
to
the
bank
which
we
proposed
to
follow
right
round
to
the
mouth
of
the
ouse
a
bank
that
runs
not
straight
but
in
great
broken
lines
as
in
fortification
and
from
which
far
off
upon
the
right
one
sees
the
famous
churches
of
the
wringland
far
off
upon
the
left
a
hint
beyond
the
marshes
and
the
sands
of
the
very
distant
open
sea
a
gale
had
risen
with
the
morning
and
while
it
invigorated
the
travellers
in
these
wastes
it
seemed
to
increase
their
loneliness
for
it
broke
upon
nothing
and
it
removed
the
interest
of
the
eye
from
the
monotonous
sad
land
to
the
charge
and
change
of
the
torn
sky
above
but
in
a
sense
also
it
impelled
us
as
though
we
were
sailing
before
it
as
it
swept
along
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
helped
us
to
forget
the
interminable
hours
the
birds
for
whom
this
estuary
is
a
kind
of
sanctuary
and
a
place
of
secure
food
in
all
weathers
the
birds
swept
out
in
great
flocks
over
the
flats
towards
the
sea
they
were
the
only
companionship
afforded
to
us
upon
this
long
day
and
they
had
or
i
fancied
they
had
in
their
demeanour
a
kind
of
contempt
for
the
rare
human
beings
they
might
see
as
though
knowing
how
little
man
could
do
upon
those
sands
they
fed
all
together
upon
the
edge
of
the
water
upon
the
edge
of
the
falling
tide
very
far
off
making
long
bands
of
white
that
mixed
with
the
tiny
breaking
wavelets
now
and
then
they
rose
in
bodies
and
so
rising
disappeared
but
as
they
would
turn
and
wheel
against
the
wind
seeking
some
other
ground
they
sent
from
moment
to
moment
flashes
of
delicate
and
rare
light
from
the
great
multitude
of
their
wings
i
know
of
nothing
to
which
one
may
compare
these
glimpses
of
evanescent
shining
but
these
two
things
the
flash
of
a
sword
edge
and
the
rapid
turning
in
human
hands
of
a
diaphanous
veil
held
in
the
light
it
shone
or
glinted
for
a
moment
then
they
would
all
wheel
together
and
it
disappeared
so
watching
them
as
a
kind
of
marvel
we
saw
distant
across
the
sea
a
faint
blue
tower
and
recognised
it
for
boston
stump
so
many
many
miles
away
but
for
the
birds
and
this
landmark
which
never
left
us
all
the
length
of
the
dyke
was
empty
of
any
sight
save
the
mixing
of
the
sea
and
the
land
then
gradually
the
heights
in
norfolk
beyond
grew
clearer
a
further
shore
narrowed
the
expanse
of
waters
and
we
came
to
the
river
mouth
of
the
ouse
and
caught
sight
up
the
stream
of
the
houses
of
a
town
the
cerdagne
there
is
a
part
of
europe
of
which
for
the
moment
most
people
have
not
heard
but
which
in
a
few
years
everybody
will
know
so
it
is
well
worth
telling
before
it
is
changed
what
it
is
like
it
is
called
the
cerdagne
it
is
a
very
broad
valley
stretching
out
between
hills
whose
height
is
so
incredible
or
at
least
whose
appearance
of
height
is
so
incredible
that
when
they
are
properly
painted
no
one
will
believe
them
to
be
true
indeed
i
know
a
man
who
painted
them
just
as
they
are
and
those
who
saw
the
picture
said
it
was
fantastic
and
out
of
nature
like
turner
drawings
but
those
who
had
been
with
him
and
had
seen
the
place
said
that
somehow
he
had
just
missed
the
effect
of
height
it
is
remarkable
that
in
any
country
even
if
one
does
not
know
that
country
well
what
is
unusual
to
the
country
strikes
the
traveller
at
once
and
so
it
is
with
the
cerdagne
for
all
the
valleys
of
the
pyrenees
except
this
one
are
built
upon
the
same
plan
they
are
deep
gorges
narrowing
in
two
places
to
gates
or
profound
corridors
one
of
these
places
being
near
the
crest
and
one
near
the
plain
and
down
these
valleys
fall
violent
torrents
and
in
them
there
is
only
room
for
tiny
villages
or
very
little
towns
squeezed
in
between
the
sheer
surfaces
of
the
rock
or
the
steep
forests
so
it
is
with
the
valley
of
laruns
and
with
that
of
meuléon
and
with
that
of
luz
and
with
those
of
the
two
bagnères
and
with
the
val
and
with
the
val
and
with
the
very
famous
valley
of
andorra
with
valleys
so
made
the
mountains
are
indeed
more
awful
than
they
might
be
in
the
alps
but
you
never
see
them
standing
out
and
apart
and
the
mastering
elevation
of
the
pyrenees
is
not
apprehended
until
you
come
to
the
cirque
or
hollow
at
the
end
of
each
valley
just
underneath
the
main
ridge
by
that
time
you
have
climbed
so
far
that
you
have
halved
the
height
of
the
barrier
but
the
cerdagne
unlike
all
the
other
valleys
is
as
broad
as
half
a
county
and
is
full
of
towns
and
fields
and
men
and
mules
and
slow
rivulets
and
corn
so
standing
upon
either
side
and
looking
to
the
other
you
see
all
together
and
in
the
large
its
mountain
boundaries
it
is
like
the
sight
of
the
grampians
from
beyond
strathmore
but
very
much
more
grand
moreover
as
no
one
has
written
sufficiently
about
it
to
prepare
the
traveller
for
what
he
is
to
see
and
in
attempting
to
do
so
here
i
am
probably
doing
wrong
but
a
man
must
write
down
what
he
has
seen
the
cerdagne
breaks
upon
him
quite
unexpectedly
and
his
descent
into
that
wealthy
plain
is
the
entry
into
a
new
world
he
may
have
learnt
the
mountains
by
heart
as
we
had
in
many
stumbling
marches
and
many
nights
slept
out
beneath
the
trees
and
many
crossings
of
the
main
chain
by
those
precipitous
cols
which
make
the
ridge
of
the
pyrenees
more
like
a
paling
than
a
mountain
crest
but
though
he
should
know
them
thoroughly
all
the
way
from
the
atlantic
for
two
hundred
miles
the
cerdagne
will
only
appear
to
him
the
more
astonishing
it
renews
in
any
man
however
familiar
he
may
be
with
great
mountains
the
impressions
of
that
day
when
he
first
saw
the
distant
summits
and
thought
them
to
be
clouds
apart
from
all
this
the
cerdagne
is
full
of
a
lively
interest
because
it
preserves
far
better
than
any
other
pyrenean
valley
those
two
pyrenean
things
the
memory
of
european
history
and
the
intense
local
spirit
of
the
vals
the
memory
of
european
history
is
to
be
seen
in
the
odd
tricks
which
the
frontier
plays
it
was
laid
down
by
the
commissioners
of
mazarin
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
and
instead
of
following
the
watershed
which
would
leave
the
cerdagne
all
spanish
politically
as
it
is
catalan
by
language
and
position
it
crosses
the
valley
from
one
side
to
another
leaving
the
top
end
of
it
and
the
sources
of
its
rivers
under
french
control
that
endless
debate
as
to
whether
race
or
government
will
most
affect
a
people
can
here
be
tested
though
hardly
decided
the
villages
are
spanish
the
hour
of
meals
is
spanish
and
the
wine
is
spanish
wine
but
the
clocks
keep
time
and
the
streets
are
swept
and
oddest
of
all
the
cooking
is
french
cooking
the
people
are
spanish
in
that
they
are
slow
to
serve
you
or
to
find
you
a
mount
or
to
show
you
the
way
but
they
are
french
in
that
they
are
punctual
in
the
hour
at
which
they
have
promised
to
do
these
things
and
they
are
spanish
in
the
shapes
of
their
ricks
and
the
nature
of
their
implements
but
french
in
the
aspect
of
their
fields
one
might
also
discuss
it
would
be
most
profitable
of
all
where
they
are
spanish
and
where
they
are
french
in
their
observance
of
religion
this
freak
which
the
frontier
plays
in
cutting
so
united
a
countryside
into
two
by
an
imaginary
line
is
further
emphasised
by
an
island
of
spanish
territory
which
has
been
left
stranded
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
the
valley
it
is
called
llivia
and
is
about
as
large
as
a
large
english
country
parish
with
a
small
country
town
in
the
middle
one
comes
across
the
fields
from
villages
where
the
signs
and
villagers
and
the
very
look
of
the
surface
of
the
road
are
french
one
suddenly
notices
spanish
soldiers
spanish
signs
and
spanish
prices
in
the
streets
of
the
little
place
one
leaves
it
and
in
five
minutes
one
is
in
france
again
it
is
connected
with
its
own
country
by
a
neutral
road
but
it
is
an
island
of
territory
all
the
same
and
the
reason
that
it
was
so
left
isolated
is
very
typical
of
the
old
regime
with
its
solemn
legal
pedantry
which
we
in
england
alone
preserve
in
all
western
europe
for
the
treaty
which
marked
the
limits
here
ceded
to
the
french
the
valley
and
all
its
villages
the
spaniards
pleaded
that
llivia
was
not
a
village
but
a
town
and
their
plea
was
admitted
i
began
by
saying
that
this
wide
basin
of
land
with
its
strong
people
and
its
isolated
traditions
though
it
was
so
little
known
would
soon
be
too
well
known
so
it
will
be
and
the
reason
is
this
that
the
very
low
pass
at
one
end
of
it
will
soon
be
crossed
by
a
railway
it
is
the
only
low
pass
in
the
pyrenees
and
it
is
so
gradual
and
even
upon
the
spanish
side
that
the
railway
will
everywhere
be
above
ground
within
perhaps
five
years
it
will
be
for
the
pyrenees
what
the
brenner
is
for
the
alps
and
when
that
is
done
any
one
who
has
read
this
may
go
and
see
for
himself
whether
it
is
not
true
that
from
that
plain
at
evening
the
frontier
ridge
of
andorra
seems
to
be
the
highest
thing
in
the
world
carcassonne
carcassonne
differs
from
other
monumental
towns
in
this
that
it
preserves
exactly
the
aspect
of
many
centuries
up
to
a
certain
moment
and
from
that
moment
has
set
and
has
suffered
no
further
change
you
see
and
touch
as
you
walk
along
its
ramparts
all
the
generations
from
that
crisis
in
the
fifth
century
when
the
public
power
was
finally
despaired
of
and
after
which
each
group
of
the
western
empire
began
to
see
to
its
own
preservation
down
to
that
last
achievement
of
the
thirteenth
when
medieval
civilisation
had
reached
its
full
flower
and
was
ready
for
the
decline
that
followed
the
death
of
louis
and
the
extinction
of
the
german
phantasy
of
empire
no
other
town
can
present
so
vivid
and
a
fossil
of
the
seven
hundred
years
into
which
poured
and
melted
all
the
dissolution
of
antiquity
and
out
of
which
was
formed
or
chrystallised
the
highly
specialised
diversity
of
our
modern
europe
in
the
fascination
of
extreme
age
many
english
sites
are
richer
winchester
and
canterbury
may
be
quoted
from
among
a
hundred
in
the
superimposition
of
age
upon
age
of
human
history
arles
and
rome
are
far
more
surprising
in
historic
continuity
most
european
towns
surpass
it
from
paris
whose
public
justice
worship
and
market
have
kept
to
the
same
site
for
quite
sixteen
centuries
to
london
of
which
the
city
at
least
preserves
upon
three
sides
the
roman
limit
but
no
town
can
of
its
nature
give
as
does
carcassonne
this
overwhelming
impression
of
survival
or
resurrection
the
attitude
and
position
of
carcassonne
enforce
its
character
up
above
the
river
but
a
little
set
back
from
the
valley
right
against
the
dawn
as
you
come
to
it
from
toulouse
through
the
morning
stands
a
long
steep
and
isolated
rock
the
whole
summit
of
which
from
the
sharp
cliff
on
the
north
to
that
other
on
the
south
is
doubled
in
height
by
what
seems
one
vast
wall
and
more
than
twenty
towers
indeed
it
is
at
such
a
time
in
early
morning
and
best
in
winter
when
the
frost
defines
and
chisels
every
outline
that
carcassonne
should
be
drawn
you
then
see
it
in
a
band
of
dark
all
even
in
texture
serrated
and
battlemented
and
towered
with
the
metallic
shining
of
the
dawn
behind
it
so
to
have
seen
it
makes
it
very
difficult
to
write
of
it
or
even
to
paint
what
one
wishes
to
do
is
rather
to
work
it
out
in
enamel
upon
a
surface
of
bronze
this
rock
wholly
covered
with
the
works
of
the
city
stands
looking
at
the
pyrenees
and
holding
the
only
level
valley
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
garonne
and
even
if
one
had
read
nothing
concerning
it
one
would
understand
why
it
has
filled
all
the
legends
of
the
return
of
armies
from
spain
why
victor
hugo
could
not
rest
from
the
memory
of
it
and
why
it
is
so
strongly
woven
in
with
the
story
of
charlemagne
there
is
another
and
better
reason
for
the
quality
of
carcassonne
and
that
is
the
act
to
which
i
can
recall
no
perfect
parallel
in
christian
history
by
which
louis
turned
what
had
been
a
living
town
into
a
mere
stronghold
every
inhabitant
of
carcassonne
was
transferred
not
to
suburbs
but
right
beyond
the
river
a
mile
and
more
away
to
the
site
of
that
delightful
town
which
is
the
carcassonne
of
maps
and
railways
the
place
where
the
seventeenth
century
meets
you
in
graceful
ornaments
and
where
is
to
my
certain
knowledge
the
best
inn
south
of
parallel
louis
turned
the
rock
into
a
mere
stronghold
strengthened
it
built
new
towers
and
curtained
them
into
that
unsurpassable
masonry
of
the
central
middle
ages
which
you
may
yet
admire
in
and
in
carnarvon
this
political
act
the
removal
of
a
whole
city
may
have
been
accomplished
in
many
other
places
it
is
certainly
recorded
of
many
but
for
the
moment
at
least
i
can
remember
none
except
carcassonne
in
which
its
consequences
have
remained
to
this
many
causes
have
contributed
but
chiefly
this
that
the
new
town
was
transferred
to
the
open
plain
from
the
trammels
of
a
narrow
plateau
just
at
the
moment
when
all
the
towns
of
western
europe
were
growing
and
breaking
their
bonds
just
after
the
principal
cities
of
europe
had
got
their
charters
and
when
paris
the
typical
municipality
of
that
age
as
of
our
own
was
trebling
its
area
and
its
population
the
transference
of
the
population
once
accomplished
the
rock
and
towers
of
carcassonne
ceased
to
change
and
to
grow
humanity
was
gone
the
fortress
was
still
of
great
value
in
war
the
black
prince
attempted
its
destruction
and
it
is
only
within
living
memory
that
it
ceased
to
be
set
down
on
maps
and
in
government
offices
as
a
fortified
place
but
the
necessity
for
immediate
defence
and
the
labour
which
would
have
remodelled
it
had
disappeared
there
had
disappeared
also
that
eager
and
destructive
activity
which
accompanies
any
permanent
gathering
of
french
families
the
new
town
on
the
plain
changed
perpetually
and
is
changing
still
it
has
lost
almost
everything
of
the
middle
ages
it
carries
by
a
sort
of
momentum
a
flavour
of
louis
xiv
but
the
masons
are
at
it
as
they
are
everywhere
from
the
channel
to
the
mediterranean
for
to
pull
down
and
rebuild
is
the
permanent
recreation
of
the
french
the
rock
remains
it
is
put
in
order
whenever
a
stone
falls
out
of
place
no
one
of
weight
has
talked
nonsense
here
against
restoration
for
the
sense
of
the
past
is
too
strong
but
though
it
is
minutely
and
continually
repaired
old
carcassonne
does
not
change
there
is
no
other
set
of
walls
in
europe
of
which
this
is
true
walking
round
the
circuit
of
these
walls
and
watching
from
their
height
the
long
line
of
the
mountains
one
is
first
held
by
that
modern
subject
the
landscape
or
that
still
more
modern
fascination
of
great
hills
next
one
feels
what
the
middle
ages
designed
of
mass
and
weight
and
height
and
wonders
by
what
accident
of
the
mind
they
so
succeeded
in
suggesting
infinity
one
remembers
beauvais
which
is
infinitely
high
at
evening
and
the
tower
of
portrut
which
seems
bigger
than
any
hill
but
when
these
commoner
emotions
are
passed
one
comes
upon
a
very
different
thing
a
little
tower
there
jutting
out
perilously
from
the
wall
shows
three
courses
of
a
red
set
in
a
stone
when
i
saw
this
kind
of
building
i
went
close
up
and
touched
it
with
my
hand
it
was
roman
i
knew
the
signal
well
i
had
seen
that
brick
and
picked
it
loose
from
an
arab
stable
on
the
edge
of
the
sahara
and
i
had
seen
it
jutting
through
moss
on
the
high
moors
of
northumberland
i
know
a
man
who
reverently
brought
home
to
sussex
such
another
which
he
had
found
unbroken
far
beyond
damascus
upon
the
syrian
sand
it
is
easy
to
speak
of
the
empire
and
to
say
that
it
established
its
order
from
the
tyne
to
the
euphrates
but
when
one
has
travelled
alone
and
on
foot
up
and
down
the
world
and
seen
its
vastness
and
its
complexity
and
yet
everywhere
the
unity
even
of
bricks
in
their
courses
then
one
begins
to
understand
the
name
of
rome
lynn
every
man
that
lands
in
lynn
feels
all
through
him
the
antiquity
and
the
call
of
the
town
but
especially
if
he
comes
as
i
came
in
with
another
man
in
springtime
from
the
miles
and
miles
of
emptiness
and
miles
of
bending
grass
and
the
shouting
of
the
wind
after
that
morning
in
which
one
had
been
a
little
point
on
an
immense
plane
with
the
gale
not
only
above
one
as
it
commonly
is
but
all
around
one
as
it
is
at
sea
and
after
having
steeped
one
mind
in
the
peculiar
loneliness
which
haunts
a
stretch
of
and
wasted
shore
the
narrow
varied
and
unordered
streets
of
the
port
enhance
the
creations
of
man
and
emphasise
his
presence
words
so
few
are
necessarily
obscure
let
me
expand
them
i
mean
that
the
unexpected
turning
of
the
ways
in
such
a
port
is
perpetually
revealing
something
new
that
the
little
spaces
frame
as
it
were
each
unexpected
sight
thus
at
the
end
of
a
street
one
will
catch
a
patch
of
the
fens
beyond
the
river
a
great
moving
sail
a
cloud
or
the
sculptured
corner
of
an
excellent
house
the
same
history
also
that
permitted
continual
encroachment
upon
the
public
thoroughfares
and
that
built
up
a
gradual
high
street
upon
the
line
of
some
leading
from
the
fields
to
the
ferry
the
spirit
that
everywhere
permitted
the
powerful
or
the
cunning
to
withstand
authority
that
history
which
is
the
history
of
all
our
little
english
towns
has
endowed
lynn
with
an
endless
diversity
it
is
not
only
that
the
separate
things
in
such
towns
are
delightful
nor
only
that
one
comes
upon
them
suddenly
but
also
that
these
separate
things
are
so
many
they
have
characters
as
men
have
there
is
nothing
of
that
repetition
which
must
accompany
the
love
of
order
and
the
presence
of
strong
laws
the
similar
insistent
forms
which
go
with
a
strong
civilisation
as
they
give
it
majesty
so
they
give
it
also
gloom
and
a
heavy
feeling
of
finality
these
are
quite
lacking
here
in
england
where
the
poor
have
for
so
long
submitted
to
the
domination
of
the
rich
and
the
rich
have
dreaded
and
refused
a
central
government
everything
that
goes
with
the
power
of
individuals
has
added
peculiarity
and
meaning
to
all
the
stones
of
lynn
moreover
a
quality
whose
absence
all
men
now
deplore
was
once
higher
in
england
than
anywhere
else
save
perhaps
in
the
northern
italian
hills
i
mean
ownership
and
what
comes
from
ownership
the
love
of
home
you
can
see
the
past
effect
of
ownership
and
individuality
in
lynn
as
clearly
as
you
can
catch
affection
or
menace
in
a
human
voice
the
outward
expression
is
most
manifest
and
to
pass
in
and
out
along
the
lanes
in
front
of
the
old
houses
inspires
in
one
precisely
those
emotions
which
are
aroused
by
a
human
crowd
all
the
roofs
of
lynn
and
all
its
pavements
are
worthy
as
though
they
were
living
beings
of
individual
names
along
the
river
shore
from
the
race
of
the
ebb
that
had
so
nearly
drowned
me
many
years
before
i
watched
the
walls
that
mark
the
edge
of
the
town
against
the
ouse
and
especially
that
group
towards
which
the
was
struggling
against
the
eddy
and
tumble
of
the
tide
they
were
walls
of
every
age
not
high
brick
of
a
dozen
harmonious
tones
with
the
accidents
corners
and
breaches
of
perhaps
seven
hundred
years
beyond
to
the
left
down
the
river
stood
the
masts
in
the
new
docks
that
were
built
to
preserve
the
trade
of
this
difficult
port
great
new
works
of
i
know
not
what
kind
stood
like
a
bastion
against
the
plain
and
in
between
ran
these
oldest
bits
of
lynn
somnolescent
and
refreshing
permanent
the
lanes
up
from
the
ouse
when
i
landed
i
found
to
be
of
a
slow
and
natural
growth
with
that
slight
bend
to
them
that
comes
i
believe
from
the
drying
of
for
it
is
said
that
courts
of
this
kind
grew
up
in
our
all
round
our
eastern
and
the
southern
coast
in
such
a
manner
it
happened
thus
the
town
would
begin
upon
the
highest
of
the
bank
for
it
was
flatter
for
building
drier
and
easier
to
defend
than
that
part
next
to
the
water
down
from
the
town
to
the
shore
the
fishermen
would
lay
out
their
nets
to
dry
how
nets
look
when
they
are
so
laid
their
narrowness
and
the
curve
they
take
everybody
knows
then
on
the
spaces
between
the
nets
shanties
would
be
built
or
old
boats
turned
upside
down
for
shelter
so
that
the
curing
of
fish
and
the
boiling
of
tar
and
the
serving
and
parcelling
of
ropes
could
be
done
under
cover
then
as
the
number
of
people
grew
the
squatters
land
got
value
and
houses
were
raised
you
will
find
many
small
freeholds
in
such
rows
to
this
day
but
the
lines
of
the
net
remained
in
the
between
the
houses
all
this
i
was
once
told
by
an
old
man
who
helped
me
to
take
my
boat
down
breydon
he
wore
trousers
of
a
brick
red
and
the
stuff
of
them
as
thick
as
boards
and
had
on
also
a
very
thick
jersey
and
a
cap
of
fur
he
was
shaved
upon
his
lips
and
chin
but
all
round
the
rest
of
his
face
was
a
beard
he
smoked
a
tiny
pipe
quite
black
and
upon
matters
within
his
own
experience
he
was
a
great
liar
but
upon
matters
of
tradition
i
was
willing
to
believe
him
within
the
town
when
i
had
gained
it
from
that
lane
which
has
been
the
i
suppose
since
the
ferry
began
age
and
distinction
were
everywhere
where
else
thought
i
in
england
could
you
say
that
nine
years
would
make
no
change
whether
indeed
the
globe
had
that
same
wine
of
the
nineties
i
could
not
tell
for
the
hour
was
not
congenial
to
wine
but
if
it
has
some
store
of
its
burgundy
left
from
those
days
it
must
be
better
still
by
now
for
burgundy
wine
takes
nine
years
to
mature
for
nine
years
remains
in
the
plenitude
of
its
powers
and
for
nine
years
more
declines
into
an
honourable
age
and
this
is
also
true
of
claret
but
in
claret
it
goes
by
sevens
the
open
square
of
the
town
which
one
looks
at
from
the
globe
gives
one
a
mingled
pleasure
of
reminiscence
and
discovery
it
breaks
on
one
abruptly
it
is
as
wide
as
the
pasture
field
and
all
the
houses
are
ample
and
largely
founded
indeed
throughout
this
country
the
sense
that
there
is
space
enough
and
to
spare
in
such
flats
and
under
an
open
sky
has
filled
the
minds
of
builders
you
may
see
it
in
all
the
inland
towns
of
the
fens
and
one
found
it
again
here
upon
the
further
bank
upon
the
edge
of
the
fens
for
though
lynn
is
just
off
the
fens
yet
it
looks
upon
their
horizon
and
their
sky
and
belongs
to
them
in
spirit
in
this
large
and
comfortable
square
a
very
steadfast
and
most
considerable
english
bank
is
to
be
discovered
it
is
of
honest
brown
brick
its
architecture
is
of
the
plainest
its
appearance
is
such
that
its
credit
could
never
fail
and
that
the
house
alone
by
its
presence
could
conduct
a
dignified
business
for
ever
the
rooms
in
it
are
so
many
and
so
great
that
the
owners
of
such
a
bank
having
become
princes
by
its
success
could
inhabit
them
with
a
majesty
worthy
of
their
new
title
but
who
lives
above
his
shop
since
richardson
died
and
did
old
richardson
lord
knows
anyhow
the
bank
is
glorious
and
it
is
but
one
of
the
fifty
houses
that
i
saw
in
lynn
thus
in
the
same
street
as
the
globe
was
a
façade
of
stone
if
it
was
georgian
it
was
very
early
georgian
for
it
was
relieved
with
ornaments
of
a
delicate
and
accurate
sort
and
the
proportions
were
exactly
satisfying
to
the
eye
that
looked
on
it
the
stone
also
was
of
that
kind
portland
stone
i
think
which
goes
black
and
white
with
age
and
which
is
better
suited
than
any
other
to
the
english
climate
in
another
house
near
the
church
i
saw
a
roof
that
might
have
been
a
roof
for
a
town
it
covered
the
living
part
and
the
stables
and
the
outhouse
and
the
brewhouse
and
the
barns
and
for
all
i
know
the
and
the
pigeons
as
well
it
was
a
benediction
of
a
roof
a
roof
traditional
a
roof
patriarchal
a
roof
customary
a
roof
of
permanence
and
unity
a
roof
that
physically
sheltered
and
spiritually
sustained
a
roof
majestic
a
roof
eternal
in
a
word
it
was
a
roof
catholic
and
what
thought
i
is
paid
yearly
in
this
town
for
such
a
roof
as
that
i
do
not
know
but
i
know
of
another
roof
at
goudhurst
in
kent
which
would
have
cost
me
less
than
a
year
only
i
could
not
get
it
for
love
or
money
then
is
also
in
lynn
a
custom
house
not
very
english
but
very
beautiful
the
faces
carved
upon
it
were
so
vivid
that
i
could
not
but
believe
them
to
have
been
carved
in
the
netherlands
and
from
this
custom
house
looks
down
the
pinched
unhappy
face
of
that
narrow
gentleman
whom
the
great
families
destroyed
james
ii
there
is
also
in
lynn
what
i
did
not
know
was
to
be
seen
out
of
sussex
a
tudor
building
of
chipped
flints
and
on
it
the
mouldering
arms
of
elizabeth
the
last
gothic
of
this
bishop
borough
which
the
king
seized
from
the
church
clings
to
chance
houses
in
little
carven
masks
and
occasional
ogives
there
is
everywhere
a
feast
for
whatever
in
the
mind
is
curious
searching
and
reverent
and
over
the
town
as
over
all
the
failing
ports
of
our
silting
eastern
seaboard
hangs
the
air
of
a
great
past
time
the
influence
of
the
baltic
and
the
lowlands
for
these
ancient
places
do
not
change
they
permit
themselves
to
stand
apart
and
to
repose
and
by
paying
that
price
almost
alone
of
all
things
in
england
they
preserve
some
historic
continuity
and
satisfy
the
memories
in
one
blood
so
having
come
round
to
the
ouse
again
and
to
the
edge
of
the
fens
at
lynn
i
went
off
at
random
whither
next
it
pleased
me
to
go
the
guns
i
had
slept
perhaps
seven
hours
when
a
lantern
woke
me
flashed
in
my
face
and
i
wondered
confusedly
why
there
was
straw
in
my
bed
then
i
remembered
that
i
was
not
in
bed
at
all
but
on
manoeuvres
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
sergeant
with
a
bit
of
paper
in
his
hand
he
was
giving
out
orders
and
the
little
light
he
carried
sparkled
on
the
gold
of
his
great
coat
you
the
englishman
he
said
for
that
was
what
they
called
me
as
a
nickname
go
with
the
gunners
where
is
labbé
labbé
that
man
by
profession
a
cook
by
inclination
a
marquis
and
now
by
destiny
a
very
good
driver
of
guns
the
day
before
had
gone
on
foot
he
was
to
ride
i
pointed
him
out
where
he
still
lay
sleeping
the
sergeant
stirred
him
about
with
his
foot
and
said
pacte
and
basilique
and
labbé
grunted
in
this
simple
way
every
one
knew
his
duty
labbé
that
he
had
another
hour
sleep
and
more
and
that
he
was
to
take
my
horses
i
that
i
must
rise
and
get
off
to
the
square
then
the
sergeant
went
out
of
the
barn
cursing
the
straw
on
his
spurs
and
i
lit
a
match
and
brushed
down
my
clothes
and
ran
off
to
the
square
it
was
not
yet
two
in
the
morning
the
gunners
were
drawn
up
in
a
double
line
and
we
reserve
drivers
stood
separate
there
were
only
a
dozen
of
us
and
when
they
formed
fours
we
were
at
the
tail
there
was
a
lieutenant
with
us
and
a
sergeant
also
two
bombardiers
all
mounted
and
so
we
went
off
keeping
step
till
we
were
out
of
the
town
and
then
marching
as
we
chose
and
thanking
god
for
the
change
for
it
is
no
easy
matter
for
drivers
to
march
with
gunners
their
swords
impede
them
and
though
the
french
drivers
have
not
the
ridiculous
that
theatricalise
other
armies
yet
even
their
simple
boots
are
not
well
suited
for
the
road
this
custom
of
sending
forward
reserve
drivers
on
foot
in
rotation
has
a
fine
name
to
it
it
is
called
and
must
therefore
be
old
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
we
had
leave
to
sing
and
we
began
all
together
one
of
those
long
and
charming
songs
with
which
the
french
soldiery
to
forget
the
tedium
of
the
road
and
the
hardship
of
arms
now
if
a
man
desired
to
answer
once
and
for
all
those
pedants
who
refuse
to
understand
the
nature
of
military
training
both
those
who
make
a
silly
of
it
and
those
who
make
it
hideous
and
diabolical
there
could
be
no
better
way
than
to
let
him
hear
the
songs
of
soldiers
in
the
french
service
at
least
these
songs
are
a
whole
expression
of
the
its
extreme
coarseness
its
steady
and
perpetual
humour
its
hatred
of
the
hard
conditions
of
discipline
and
also
these
songs
continually
portray
the
distant
but
delightful
picture
of
things
i
mean
of
things
rare
and
far
off
which
must
lie
at
the
back
of
men
minds
when
they
have
much
work
to
do
with
their
hands
and
much
living
in
the
open
air
and
no
women
to
pour
out
their
wine
moreover
these
songs
have
another
excellent
quality
they
show
all
through
that
splendid
unconsciousness
of
the
soldier
that
inability
in
him
to
see
himself
from
without
or
to
pose
as
civilians
always
think
and
say
he
poses
we
sang
that
morning
first
the
chief
and
oldest
of
the
songs
it
dates
from
the
flemish
wars
of
louis
xiv
and
is
called
auprès
de
ma
blonde
every
one
knows
the
tune
then
we
sang
the
song
of
the
miller
and
then
many
other
songs
each
longer
than
the
last
for
these
songs
like
other
lyrics
have
it
for
an
object
to
string
out
as
many
verses
as
possible
in
order
to
kill
the
endless
straight
roads
and
the
weariness
we
had
need
to
sing
no
sun
rose
but
the
day
broke
over
an
ugly
plain
with
hardly
any
trees
and
that
grey
and
wretched
dawn
came
in
with
a
cold
and
dispiriting
rain
unrefreshed
by
wind
colson
who
was
a
foolish
little
man
the
son
of
a
squire
marching
by
my
side
wondered
where
and
how
we
should
be
dried
that
day
the
army
was
for
ever
producing
problems
for
colson
and
i
was
often
his
comforter
he
liked
to
talk
to
me
and
hear
about
england
and
the
rich
people
and
their
security
and
how
they
never
served
as
soldiers
from
luxury
and
how
what
he
could
not
understand
the
poor
had
a
bargain
struck
with
them
by
the
rich
whereby
they
also
need
not
serve
i
could
learn
from
him
the
meaning
of
many
french
words
which
i
did
not
yet
know
he
had
some
little
education
had
i
asked
the
more
ignorant
men
of
my
battery
they
would
only
have
laughed
but
he
had
read
in
common
books
of
the
differences
between
nations
and
could
explain
many
things
to
me
colson
then
complaining
of
the
rain
and
wondering
where
he
should
get
dried
i
told
him
to
consider
not
so
much
the
happy
english
but
rather
his
poor
scabbard
and
how
he
should
clean
it
after
the
march
and
his
poor
clothes
all
coated
with
mud
and
needing
an
hour
brushing
and
his
poor
temper
which
if
he
did
not
take
great
care
would
make
him
grow
up
to
be
an
and
a
byword
so
we
wrangled
and
it
still
rained
our
songs
grew
rarer
and
there
was
at
last
no
noise
but
the
slush
of
all
those
feet
beating
the
muddy
road
and
the
occasional
clank
of
metal
as
a
scabbard
touched
some
other
steel
or
a
slung
carbine
struck
the
hilt
of
a
bayonet
it
was
well
on
in
the
morning
when
the
guns
caught
us
up
and
passed
us
the
drivers
all
shrouded
in
their
coats
and
bending
forward
in
the
rain
the
guns
coated
and
splashed
with
thick
mud
and
the
horses
also
threatened
hours
of
grooming
i
looked
mine
up
and
down
as
labbé
passed
on
them
and
i
groaned
for
it
is
a
rule
that
a
man
grooms
his
own
horses
whether
he
has
ridden
them
or
no
and
after
all
day
in
and
day
out
it
works
fair
the
guns
disappeared
into
the
mist
of
rain
and
we
went
on
through
more
hours
of
miserable
tramping
seeing
no
spire
ahead
of
us
and
unable
to
count
on
a
long
halt
still
as
we
went
i
noticed
that
we
were
on
some
great
division
between
provinces
perhaps
or
between
river
valleys
for
in
france
there
are
many
bare
upland
plateaus
dividing
separate
districts
and
it
is
a
feature
of
the
country
that
the
districts
so
divided
have
either
formed
separate
provinces
in
the
past
or
at
any
rate
even
if
they
have
not
had
political
recognition
have
stood
and
do
still
stand
for
separate
units
in
french
society
it
was
more
apparent
with
every
mile
as
we
went
on
that
we
were
approaching
new
things
the
plain
was
naked
save
for
rare
planted
trees
and
here
and
there
a
long
way
off
on
the
horizon
it
seemed
a
farm
or
two
unprotected
and
alone
the
rain
ceased
and
the
steady
grey
sky
broke
a
little
as
we
marched
on
still
in
silence
and
by
this
time
thirsty
and
a
little
dazed
a
ravine
opened
in
a
bare
plateau
and
we
saw
that
it
held
a
little
village
they
led
us
into
it
down
a
short
steep
bit
of
road
and
lined
us
up
by
a
great
basin
of
sparkling
water
and
every
man
was
mad
to
break
ranks
and
drink
but
no
one
dared
the
children
of
the
village
gathered
in
a
little
group
and
looked
at
us
and
we
envied
their
freedom
when
we
had
stood
thus
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
an
orderly
came
riding
in
all
splashed
and
his
horse
coat
rough
with
the
rain
and
steaming
up
into
the
air
he
came
up
to
the
lieutenant
in
command
and
delivered
an
order
then
he
rode
away
fast
northward
along
the
ravine
and
out
of
the
village
the
lieutenant
when
he
had
gone
formed
us
into
a
little
column
and
we
who
had
expected
to
dismiss
at
any
moment
were
full
of
anger
and
were
sullen
to
find
that
by
some
wretched
order
or
other
we
had
to
take
another
hour
of
the
road
first
we
had
to
go
back
four
miles
along
the
road
we
had
already
come
and
then
to
branch
off
perpendicular
to
our
general
line
of
march
and
as
it
seemed
to
us
quite
out
of
our
way
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
move
a
great
mass
of
men
through
a
desolate
country
by
small
units
and
leave
them
dependent
on
the
country
and
it
is
rather
wonderful
that
they
do
it
so
neatly
and
effect
the
junctions
so
well
but
the
private
soldier
who
stands
for
those
little
black
blocks
on
the
military
map
has
a
boy
impatience
in
him
and
a
very
wise
man
if
he
wishes
to
keep
an
army
in
spirit
will
avoid
as
much
as
he
can
for
i
can
not
tell
why
nothing
takes
the
heart
out
of
a
man
like
having
to
plod
over
again
the
very
way
he
has
just
come
so
when
we
had
come
to
a
very
small
village
in
the
waste
and
halted
there
finding
our
guns
and
drivers
already
long
arrived
we
made
an
end
of
a
dull
and
meaningless
day
very
difficult
to
tell
of
because
the
story
is
merely
a
record
of
fatigue
but
in
a
diary
of
route
everything
must
be
set
down
faithfully
and
so
i
have
set
down
all
this
sodden
and
empty
day
that
night
i
sat
at
a
peasant
table
and
heard
my
four
understanding
everything
and
evidently
in
their
world
and
at
home
although
they
were
conscripts
this
turned
me
silent
and
i
sat
away
from
the
light
looking
at
the
fire
and
drying
myself
by
its
logs
as
i
heard
their
laughter
i
remembered
sussex
and
the
woods
above
arun
and
i
felt
myself
to
be
in
exile
then
we
slept
in
beds
and
the
goodwife
had
our
tunics
dry
by
morning
for
she
also
had
a
son
in
the
service
who
was
a
long
way
off
at
lyons
and
was
not
to
return
for
two
years
there
are
days
in
a
long
march
when
a
man
is
made
to
do
too
much
and
others
when
he
is
made
to
do
what
seems
meaningless
doubling
backward
on
his
road
as
we
had
done
there
are
days
when
he
seems
to
advance
very
little
but
they
are
not
days
of
repose
for
they
are
full
of
halting
and
doubts
and
special
bits
of
work
such
a
day
had
come
to
us
with
the
next
dawn
the
reason
of
all
these
things
i
mean
of
the
marches
of
the
and
of
the
short
days
was
the
complexity
of
the
only
plan
by
which
a
great
number
of
men
and
guns
can
be
taken
from
one
large
place
to
another
without
confusion
by
the
way
living
as
they
must
do
upon
the
country
and
finding
at
the
end
of
every
march
water
and
hay
for
the
horses
food
and
some
kind
of
shelter
for
the
men
and
this
plan
as
i
have
said
before
consists
in
a
european
country
in
dividing
your
force
marching
by
roads
more
or
less
parallel
and
converging
after
some
days
on
the
object
of
the
march
it
is
evident
that
in
a
somewhat
desolate
region
of
small
and
distant
hamlets
the
front
will
be
broader
and
the
columns
smaller
but
when
a
large
town
stands
in
the
line
of
march
advantage
will
be
taken
of
it
to
mass
one
men
such
a
town
was
and
it
was
because
our
battery
was
so
near
to
it
that
this
fourth
day
was
a
short
march
of
less
than
eight
miles
they
sent
the
gunners
in
early
we
drivers
started
later
than
usual
and
the
pace
was
smart
at
first
under
a
happy
morning
sun
but
still
around
us
were
the
bare
fields
all
but
treeless
and
the
road
was
part
of
the
plain
not
divided
by
hedges
the
bombardier
trotted
by
my
side
and
told
me
of
the
glories
of
rheims
which
was
his
native
town
he
was
a
mild
man
genial
and
good
and
little
apt
for
promotion
he
interlarded
his
conversation
with
official
remarks
to
show
a
zeal
he
never
felt
telling
one
man
that
his
tracks
were
slack
and
another
that
his
was
shirking
and
after
each
official
remark
he
returned
up
abeam
of
me
to
tell
me
more
of
the
riches
and
splendour
of
rheims
he
chose
me
out
for
this
favour
because
i
already
knew
the
countryside
of
the
upper
champagne
and
had
twice
seen
his
city
he
promised
me
that
when
we
got
our
first
leave
from
camp
he
would
show
me
many
sights
in
the
town
but
this
he
said
hoping
that
i
would
pay
for
the
entertainment
as
indeed
i
did
we
did
not
halt
nor
did
we
pass
the
gunners
that
morning
but
when
we
had
gone
about
four
miles
or
so
the
road
began
to
descend
through
a
wide
gully
and
we
saw
before
us
the
secluded
and
fruitful
valley
of
the
meuse
it
is
here
of
an
even
width
for
miles
bounded
by
regular
low
hills
we
were
coming
down
the
eastern
wall
of
that
valley
and
on
the
parallel
western
side
a
similar
height
with
similar
ravines
and
gullies
leading
down
to
the
river
bounded
our
narrow
view
i
caught
the
distant
sound
of
trumpets
up
there
beyond
us
and
nearer
was
the
unmistakable
rumble
of
the
guns
the
clatter
of
horses
below
in
the
valley
road
and
the
shouting
of
commands
were
the
signs
that
the
regiment
was
meeting
the
road
turned
on
a
kind
of
platform
just
before
it
joined
the
main
highway
a
few
feet
above
it
we
halted
to
wait
our
order
and
we
saw
the
guns
go
by
only
half
the
regiment
was
to
halt
at
but
six
batteries
guns
their
men
horses
apparatus
forges
and
waggons
occupying
and
advancing
in
streams
over
a
valley
are
a
wonderful
sight
clouds
of
dust
and
the
noise
of
the
metal
woke
the
silent
places
of
the
meuse
and
sometimes
river
birds
would
rise
and
wheel
in
the
air
as
the
clamour
neared
them
far
off
a
lonely
battery
was
coming
down
the
western
slope
to
join
the
throng
in
its
order
and
for
some
reason
their
two
trumpets
were
still
playing
the
march
and
lending
to
this
great
display
the
unity
of
music
we
dismounted
and
watched
from
the
turf
of
the
roadside
a
pageant
which
the
accident
of
an
ordered
and
servile
life
afforded
us
for
it
is
true
of
armies
that
the
compensation
of
their
drudgery
and
miserable
subjection
is
the
continual
opportunity
of
these
large
emotions
and
not
only
by
their
vastness
and
arrangement
but
by
the
very
fact
that
they
merge
us
into
themselves
do
armies
widen
the
spirit
of
a
man
and
give
it
communion
with
the
majesty
of
great
numbers
one
becomes
a
part
of
many
men
the
seventh
battery
with
which
we
had
little
to
do
for
in
quarters
they
belonged
to
the
furthest
corner
from
our
own
first
came
by
and
passed
us
with
that
interminable
repetition
of
similar
things
which
is
the
note
of
a
force
on
the
march
and
makes
it
seem
like
a
river
flowing
we
recognised
it
by
the
figure
of
one
chevalier
a
major
attached
to
them
he
was
an
man
of
whom
many
stories
were
told
kindly
with
a
round
face
and
he
wore
eyeglasses
either
for
the
distinction
they
afforded
or
because
he
was
short
of
sight
the
seventh
passed
us
and
their
forge
and
waggon
ended
the
long
train
a
regulation
space
between
them
and
the
next
allowed
the
dust
to
lie
a
little
and
then
the
ninth
came
by
we
knew
them
well
because
in
quarters
they
were
our
neighbours
at
their
head
was
their
captain
whose
name
was
levy
he
was
a
jew
small
very
and
a
man
who
worked
astonishingly
hard
he
was
very
popular
with
his
men
and
his
battery
was
happy
and
boasted
he
cared
especially
for
their
food
and
would
go
into
their
kitchen
daily
to
taste
the
soup
he
was
also
a
silent
man
he
sat
his
horse
badly
bent
and
crouched
but
his
eyes
were
very
keen
and
he
again
was
a
character
of
whom
the
men
talked
and
told
stories
i
believe
he
was
something
of
a
mathematician
but
we
knew
little
of
such
things
where
our
superiors
were
concerned
as
the
ninth
battery
passed
us
we
were
given
the
order
to
mount
and
knew
that
our
place
came
next
the
and
the
lifted
swords
down
the
road
contained
for
a
while
the
batteries
that
were
to
follow
and
we
filed
out
of
our
side
road
into
the
long
gap
they
had
left
us
then
taking
up
the
trot
ourselves
we
heard
the
order
passing
down
infinitely
till
it
was
lost
in
the
length
of
the
road
the
trumpets
galloped
past
us
and
formed
at
the
head
of
the
column
a
much
more
triumphant
noise
of
brass
than
we
had
yet
heard
heralded
us
with
a
kind
of
insolence
and
the
whole
train
with
its
two
miles
and
more
of
noisy
power
gloried
into
the
old
town
of
to
the
great
joy
of
its
young
men
and
women
at
the
windows
to
the
annoyance
of
the
householders
to
the
stupefaction
of
the
old
and
doubtless
to
the
ultimate
advantage
of
the
republic
when
we
had
formed
park
in
the
grey
ridden
our
horses
off
to
water
at
the
river
and
to
their
quarters
cleaned
kit
and
harness
and
at
last
were
free
that
is
when
it
was
already
evening
matthieu
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
come
by
another
road
with
his
battery
met
me
strolling
on
the
bridge
matthieu
was
of
my
kind
he
had
such
a
lineage
as
i
had
and
such
an
education
we
were
glad
to
meet
he
told
me
of
his
last
pagny
hidden
on
the
upper
river
it
is
the
place
where
the
houses
of
luxembourg
were
buried
and
some
also
of
the
great
men
who
fell
when
henry
v
of
england
was
fighting
in
the
north
and
when
on
this
flank
the
eastern
dukes
were
waging
the
burgundian
wars
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
the
tumult
of
men
in
arms
had
made
echoes
along
the
valley
matthieu
and
i
went
off
together
to
dine
he
lent
me
a
pin
of
his
a
pin
with
a
worked
head
to
pin
my
tunic
with
where
it
was
torn
and
he
begged
me
to
give
it
back
to
him
but
i
have
it
still
for
i
have
never
seen
him
since
nor
shall
i
see
him
nor
he
me
till
the
great
day
the
looe
stream
of
the
complexity
of
the
sea
and
of
how
it
is
manifold
and
of
how
it
mixes
up
with
a
man
and
may
broaden
or
perfect
him
it
would
be
very
tempting
to
write
but
if
one
once
began
on
this
one
would
be
immeshed
and
drowned
in
the
metaphysic
which
never
yet
did
good
to
man
nor
beast
for
no
one
can
eat
or
drink
the
metaphysic
or
take
any
sustenance
out
of
it
and
it
has
no
movement
or
colour
and
it
does
not
give
one
joy
or
sorrow
one
can
not
paint
it
or
hear
it
and
it
is
too
thin
to
swim
about
in
leaving
then
all
these
general
things
though
they
haunt
me
and
tempt
me
at
least
i
can
deal
little
by
little
and
picture
by
picture
with
that
sea
which
is
perpetually
in
my
mind
and
let
those
who
will
draw
what
philosophies
they
choose
and
the
first
thing
i
would
like
to
describe
is
that
of
a
place
called
the
looe
stream
through
which
in
a
boat
only
the
other
day
i
sailed
for
the
first
time
noticing
many
things
when
wilfrid
went
through
those
bare
heaths
and
coppices
which
were
called
the
forest
of
anderida
and
which
lay
all
along
under
the
surrey
downs
and
through
which
there
was
a
long
deserted
roman
road
and
on
this
road
a
number
of
little
brutish
farms
and
settlements
for
this
was
twelve
hundred
years
ago
he
came
out
into
the
open
under
the
south
downs
and
crossed
my
hills
and
came
to
the
sea
plain
and
there
he
found
a
kind
of
englishman
more
savage
than
the
rest
though
heaven
knows
there
were
none
of
them
particularly
refined
or
gay
from
these
englishmen
the
noble
people
of
sussex
are
descended
already
the
rest
of
england
had
been
christian
a
hundred
years
when
wilfrid
came
down
into
the
sea
plain
and
found
to
his
astonishment
this
sparse
and
ignorant
tribe
they
were
living
in
the
ruins
of
the
roman
palaces
they
were
too
stupid
to
be
able
to
use
any
one
of
the
roman
things
they
had
destroyed
they
had
kept
perhaps
some
few
of
the
roman
women
certainly
all
the
roman
slaves
they
had
therefore
vague
memories
of
how
the
romans
tilled
the
land
but
those
memories
were
getting
worse
and
worse
for
it
was
nearly
two
hundred
years
since
the
ships
of
aella
had
sailed
into
shoreham
which
showed
him
to
be
a
man
of
immense
determination
for
it
is
a
most
difficult
harbour
and
there
were
then
no
piers
and
lights
it
was
nearly
two
hundred
years
and
there
was
only
the
least
little
glimmering
twilight
left
of
the
old
day
these
barbarians
were
going
utterly
to
pieces
as
barbarians
ever
will
when
they
are
cut
off
from
the
life
and
splendour
of
the
south
they
had
become
so
cretinous
and
idiotic
that
when
wilfrid
came
wandering
among
them
they
did
not
know
how
to
get
food
there
was
a
famine
and
as
their
miserable
religion
such
as
it
was
probably
it
was
very
like
these
little
modern
heresies
of
their
cousins
the
german
pessimists
their
religion
i
say
not
giving
them
the
jolly
energy
which
all
decent
western
religion
gives
a
man
they
being
also
by
the
wrath
of
god
deprived
of
the
use
of
wine
though
tuns
upon
tuns
of
it
were
waiting
for
them
over
the
sea
a
little
way
off
but
probably
they
thought
their
horizon
was
the
end
of
the
world
their
religion
i
say
being
of
this
nature
they
had
determined
under
the
pressure
of
that
famine
which
drove
them
so
hard
to
put
an
end
to
themselves
and
wilfrid
saw
them
tying
themselves
together
in
bands
which
shows
that
they
knew
at
least
how
to
make
rope
and
jumping
off
the
cliffs
into
the
sea
this
practice
he
determined
to
oppose
he
went
to
their
king
who
lived
in
chichester
i
suppose
or
possibly
at
bramber
and
asked
him
why
the
people
were
going
on
in
this
fashion
who
said
to
him
it
is
because
of
the
famine
wilfrid
shrugging
his
shoulders
said
why
do
they
not
eat
fish
because
said
the
king
fish
swimming
about
in
the
water
are
almost
impossible
to
catch
we
have
tried
it
in
our
hunger
a
hundred
times
but
even
when
we
had
the
good
luck
to
grasp
one
of
them
the
slippery
thing
would
glide
from
our
fingers
wilfrid
then
in
some
contempt
said
again
why
do
you
not
make
nets
and
he
explained
the
use
of
nets
to
the
whole
court
preaching
as
it
were
a
sermon
upon
nets
to
them
and
craftily
introducing
peter
and
that
great
net
which
they
hang
outside
his
tomb
in
rome
upon
his
feast
day
which
is
the
of
june
the
king
and
his
court
made
a
net
and
threw
it
into
the
sea
and
brought
out
a
great
mass
of
fish
they
were
so
pleased
that
they
told
wilfrid
they
would
do
anything
he
asked
he
baptised
them
and
they
made
him
their
first
bishop
and
he
took
up
his
residence
in
selsey
and
since
then
the
people
of
sussex
have
gone
steadily
forward
increasing
in
every
good
thing
until
they
are
now
by
far
the
first
and
most
noble
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
there
is
i
know
not
what
in
history
or
in
the
way
in
which
it
is
taught
which
makes
people
imagine
that
it
is
something
separate
from
the
life
they
are
living
and
because
of
this
modern
error
you
may
very
well
be
wondering
what
on
earth
this
true
story
of
the
foundation
of
our
country
has
to
do
with
the
looe
stream
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
the
sea
being
governed
by
a
pagan
god
made
war
at
once
and
began
eating
up
all
those
fields
which
had
specially
been
consecrated
to
the
church
civilisation
common
sense
and
human
happiness
it
is
still
doing
so
and
i
know
an
old
man
who
can
remember
a
field
all
along
by
clymping
having
been
eaten
up
by
the
sea
and
out
along
past
rustington
there
is
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
shore
a
rock
called
the
church
rock
the
remains
of
a
church
which
quite
a
little
time
ago
people
used
for
all
the
ordinary
purposes
of
a
church
the
sea
then
began
to
eat
up
selsey
before
the
conquest
though
i
can
not
remember
exactly
when
the
whole
town
had
gone
and
they
had
to
remove
the
cathedral
to
chichester
in
henry
viii
time
there
was
still
a
park
left
out
of
the
old
estates
a
park
with
trees
in
it
but
this
also
the
sea
has
eaten
up
and
here
it
is
that
i
come
to
the
looe
stream
the
looe
stream
is
a
little
dell
that
used
to
run
through
the
park
and
which
right
out
at
sea
furnishes
the
only
gate
by
which
ships
can
pass
through
the
great
maze
of
banks
and
rocks
which
go
right
out
to
sea
from
selsey
bill
miles
and
miles
and
are
called
the
owers
on
the
chart
that
district
is
still
called
the
park
and
at
very
low
tides
stumps
of
the
old
trees
can
be
seen
and
for
myself
i
believe
though
i
do
think
it
can
be
proved
that
in
among
the
masses
of
sand
and
shingle
which
go
together
to
make
the
confused
dangers
of
the
owers
you
would
find
the
walls
of
roman
palaces
and
heads
of
bronze
and
marble
and
fragments
of
mosaic
and
coins
of
gold
the
tide
coming
up
from
the
channel
finds
rising
straight
out
of
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
shelf
of
this
old
land
and
it
has
no
avenue
by
which
to
pour
through
save
this
looe
stream
which
therefore
bubbles
and
runs
like
a
though
it
is
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
if
you
did
not
know
what
was
underneath
you
you
could
not
understand
why
this
river
should
run
separate
from
the
sea
all
round
but
when
you
have
noticed
the
depths
on
the
chart
you
see
a
kind
of
picture
in
your
mind
the
wall
of
that
old
mass
of
land
standing
feet
above
the
floor
of
the
channel
and
the
top
of
what
was
once
its
fields
and
its
villas
and
its
great
church
almost
awash
at
low
tides
and
through
it
a
cleft
which
was
i
say
a
dell
in
the
old
park
but
is
now
that
looe
stream
buoyed
up
on
either
side
and
making
a
river
by
itself
running
in
the
sea
sailing
over
it
and
remembering
all
these
things
at
evening
i
got
out
of
the
boil
and
tumble
into
deep
water
it
got
darker
and
the
light
on
the
ship
showed
clearly
a
long
way
off
and
purple
against
the
west
stood
the
solemn
height
of
the
island
i
set
a
course
for
this
light
being
alone
at
the
tiller
while
my
two
companions
slept
down
below
when
the
night
was
full
the
little
variable
air
freshened
into
a
breeze
from
the
it
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
lifted
little
hearty
following
seas
and
blowing
on
my
quarter
drove
me
quickly
to
the
west
whither
i
was
bound
the
night
was
very
warm
and
very
silent
although
little
patches
of
foam
murmured
perpetually
and
though
the
wind
could
be
heard
lightly
in
the
weather
shrouds
the
star
jupiter
shone
brightly
just
above
my
wake
and
over
selsey
bill
through
a
flat
band
of
mist
the
red
moon
rose
slowly
enormous
roncesvalles
sitting
one
day
in
pampeluna
which
occupies
the
plain
just
below
the
southern
and
spanish
escarpment
of
the
pyrenees
i
and
another
remembered
with
an
equal
desire
that
we
had
all
our
lives
desired
to
see
roncesvalles
and
the
place
where
roland
died
this
town
we
said
was
that
which
charlemagne
destroyed
upon
his
march
to
the
pass
and
i
for
my
part
desired
here
as
in
every
other
part
of
europe
where
i
had
been
able
to
find
his
footsteps
to
follow
them
and
so
to
his
time
the
road
leads
slantwise
through
the
upper
valleys
of
navarre
crossing
by
passes
the
various
spurs
of
the
mountains
but
each
pass
higher
than
the
last
and
less
frequented
for
each
is
nearer
the
main
range
as
you
leave
pampeluna
the
road
grows
more
and
more
deserted
and
the
country
through
which
it
cuts
more
wild
the
advantages
of
wealth
which
are
conferred
by
the
neighbourhood
of
the
capital
of
navarre
are
rapidly
lost
as
one
proceeds
the
houses
grow
rarer
the
shrines
more
ruinous
and
more
aged
until
one
comes
at
last
upon
the
bleak
valley
which
introduces
the
final
approach
to
roncesvalles
the
wealth
and
order
everywhere
associated
with
the
basque
blood
have
wholly
disappeared
this
people
is
not
receding
it
holds
its
own
as
it
deserves
to
do
but
as
there
are
new
fields
which
it
has
occupied
within
the
present
century
upon
the
more
western
hills
so
there
are
others
to
the
east
and
this
valley
among
them
from
whence
it
has
disappeared
the
basque
names
remain
but
the
people
are
no
longer
of
the
basque
type
and
the
tongue
is
forgotten
so
gradual
is
the
ascent
and
so
continual
the
little
cols
which
have
to
be
surmounted
that
a
man
does
not
notice
how
much
upward
he
is
being
led
towards
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
when
he
comes
at
last
upon
the
grove
from
which
he
sees
the
plateau
of
roncesvalles
spread
before
him
he
wonders
that
the
chain
of
the
pyrenees
which
here
lie
out
along
in
cliffs
like
sharp
sunward
walls
stretching
in
a
strict
perspective
to
the
distant
horizon
should
seem
so
low
the
reason
that
this
white
wall
of
cliffs
seems
so
low
is
that
the
traveller
is
standing
upon
the
last
of
a
series
of
great
steps
which
have
led
him
up
towards
the
frontier
much
as
the
prairie
leads
one
up
towards
the
rockies
in
colorado
when
he
has
passed
through
the
very
pleasant
wood
which
lies
directly
beneath
the
cliffs
and
reaches
the
little
village
of
roncesvalles
itself
he
wonders
still
more
that
so
famous
a
pass
should
be
so
small
a
thing
the
pass
from
this
side
is
so
broad
with
so
low
a
saddle
of
grass
that
it
seems
more
like
the
crossing
of
the
sussex
downs
than
the
crossing
of
an
awful
range
of
mountains
it
is
a
rounded
gap
up
to
which
there
lifts
a
pretty
little
wooded
combe
and
no
one
could
be
certain
during
the
spent
in
climbing
such
a
petty
summit
that
he
was
in
so
climbing
conquering
los
altos
the
high
pyrenees
but
when
the
summit
is
reached
then
the
meaning
of
the
and
the
place
that
passage
has
taken
in
history
is
comprehended
in
a
moment
one
sees
at
what
a
height
one
was
in
that
plain
of
roncesvalles
and
one
sees
how
the
main
range
dominates
the
world
for
down
below
one
an
enormous
cleft
into
the
stuff
of
the
mountains
falls
suddenly
and
almost
sheer
and
you
see
unexpectedly
beneath
you
the
approach
from
france
into
spain
the
gulf
at
its
narrowest
is
tremendous
but
more
than
that
when
the
floor
of
the
valley
is
reached
that
floor
itself
slopes
away
down
and
down
by
runs
and
by
cascades
towards
the
very
distant
plains
of
the
north
upon
which
the
funnel
debouches
moreover
it
was
up
this
gulf
and
from
the
north
that
the
armies
came
it
was
this
vision
of
a
precipice
that
seized
them
when
their
leaders
had
determined
to
invade
the
peninsula
this
also
was
what
for
so
many
generations
so
many
wanderers
must
have
seen
who
came
to
wonder
at
the
place
where
the
rearguard
of
charlemagne
had
been
destroyed
the
whole
of
the
slope
is
covered
with
an
ancient
wood
and
this
wood
is
so
steep
that
it
would
be
impossible
or
dangerous
to
venture
down
it
the
old
carolingian
road
skirts
the
with
difficulty
clinging
well
up
upon
its
flank
the
great
modern
road
which
is
excellent
and
made
for
artillery
has
to
go
even
nearer
the
summit
below
them
there
falls
away
a
slant
or
edge
to
which
the
huge
beech
trees
cling
almost
parallel
to
the
steep
earth
running
their
perpendicular
lines
so
high
and
close
against
the
hill
that
they
look
like
pines
as
you
peer
down
in
among
the
trunks
you
see
the
darkness
increasing
until
the
eye
can
penetrate
no
more
and
dead
enormous
trees
that
have
lived
their
centuries
and
have
fallen
perhaps
for
decades
lie
across
the
aisles
of
the
wood
propped
up
against
their
living
fellows
for
by
one
of
those
political
accidents
which
are
common
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
pyrenees
both
sides
of
the
watershed
belong
to
spain
so
that
no
government
or
modern
energy
has
come
to
disturb
the
silence
one
would
swear
that
the
last
to
order
this
wood
were
the
romans
i
had
thought
to
find
so
famous
a
valley
peopled
or
at
least
visited
i
found
it
utterly
alone
and
even
free
from
travellers
as
though
the
wealthier
part
of
europe
had
forgotten
the
most
famous
of
christian
epics
i
saw
no
nor
any
women
only
at
last
in
the
very
depths
of
the
valley
a
boy
cutting
grass
in
a
tiny
patch
of
open
land
and
it
was
hereabouts
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
that
the
peers
were
killed
the
song
of
course
makes
them
fall
on
the
far
side
of
the
summit
upon
the
fields
of
roncesvalles
with
the
sun
setting
right
at
them
along
the
hills
and
that
is
as
it
should
be
for
it
is
evident
that
in
a
poem
the
hero
fighting
among
hills
should
die
upon
the
enemy
side
of
the
hills
but
that
is
not
the
place
where
roland
really
died
the
place
where
he
really
died
he
and
oliver
and
turpin
and
all
the
others
was
here
in
the
very
recess
of
the
northern
valley
it
was
here
only
that
rocks
could
have
been
rolled
down
upon
an
army
and
here
is
that
narrow
strangling
gorge
where
the
line
of
march
could
most
easily
have
been
cut
in
two
by
the
fury
of
the
mountaineers
also
eginhard
says
very
clearly
that
they
had
already
passed
the
hills
and
seen
france
and
that
is
final
it
was
from
these
cliffs
then
that
such
an
echo
was
made
by
the
horn
of
roland
and
it
was
down
that
funnel
of
a
valley
that
the
noise
grew
until
it
filled
christendom
and
it
was
up
that
gorge
that
there
came
as
it
says
in
the
song
the
host
in
a
tide
returning
charles
the
king
and
his
barony
this
was
the
place
and
any
man
who
may
yet
believe
i
know
such
a
discussion
is
pedantry
any
man
who
may
yet
believe
the
song
of
roland
to
have
been
a
northern
legend
had
better
come
to
this
place
and
drink
the
mountains
in
for
whoever
high
are
the
hills
and
huge
and
dim
with
cloud
down
in
the
deeps
the
living
streams
are
loud
had
certainly
himself
stood
in
the
silence
and
majesty
of
this
valley
it
was
already
nearly
dark
when
we
two
men
had
clambered
down
to
that
place
and
up
between
the
walls
of
the
valley
we
had
already
seen
the
early
stars
we
pushed
on
to
the
french
frontier
in
an
eager
appetite
for
cleanliness
and
human
food
the
last
spanish
town
is
called
val
carlos
as
it
ought
to
be
considering
that
charlemagne
himself
had
once
come
roaring
by
when
we
reached
it
in
the
darkness
we
had
completed
a
forced
march
of
miles
going
light
it
is
true
and
carrying
nothing
each
of
us
but
a
gourd
of
wine
and
a
sack
but
we
were
very
tired
there
at
the
goal
of
our
effort
one
faint
sign
of
government
and
of
men
at
last
appeared
it
was
in
character
with
all
the
rest
one
might
not
cross
the
frontier
upon
the
road
without
a
written
leave
the
written
leave
was
given
us
and
in
half
an
hour
spain
was
free
the
slant
off
the
land
we
live
a
very
little
time
before
we
have
reached
the
middle
of
our
time
perhaps
but
not
long
before
we
discover
the
magnitude
of
our
inheritance
consider
england
how
many
men
i
should
like
to
know
have
discovered
before
thirty
what
treasures
they
may
work
in
her
air
she
magnifies
us
inwards
and
outwards
her
fields
can
lead
the
mind
down
towards
the
subtle
beginning
of
things
the
tiny
irridescence
of
insects
the
play
of
light
upon
the
facets
of
a
blade
of
grass
her
skies
can
lead
the
mind
up
infinitely
into
regions
where
it
seems
to
expand
and
fill
no
matter
what
immensities
it
was
the
wind
off
the
land
that
made
me
think
of
all
this
possession
in
which
i
am
to
enjoy
so
short
a
usufruct
i
sat
in
my
boat
holding
that
tiller
of
mine
which
is
not
over
firm
and
is
but
a
rough
bar
of
iron
there
was
no
breeze
in
the
air
and
the
little
deep
vessel
swung
slightly
to
the
breathing
of
the
sea
her
great
mainsail
and
her
came
over
lazily
as
she
swung
and
filled
themselves
with
the
cheating
semblance
of
a
wind
the
boom
creaked
in
the
and
at
every
roll
the
slack
of
the
mainsheet
tautened
with
a
kind
of
little
thud
which
thrilled
the
deck
behind
me
i
saw
under
the
curve
of
my
headsail
the
long
and
hazy
line
which
is
the
only
frontier
of
england
the
plain
that
rather
marries
with
than
defies
her
peculiar
seas
for
it
was
in
the
channel
and
not
ten
miles
from
the
coastline
of
my
own
country
that
these
thoughts
rose
in
me
during
the
calm
at
the
end
of
winter
and
the
boat
was
drifting
down
more
swiftly
than
i
knew
upon
the
ebb
of
the
outer
tide
far
off
to
the
south
sunlight
played
upon
the
water
and
was
gone
again
the
great
ships
did
not
pass
near
me
and
so
i
sat
under
a
hazy
sky
restraining
the
slight
vibration
of
the
helm
and
waiting
for
the
wind
in
whatever
place
a
man
may
be
the
spring
will
come
to
him
i
have
heard
of
men
in
prison
who
would
note
the
day
when
its
influence
passed
through
the
narrow
window
that
was
their
only
communion
with
their
kind
it
comes
even
to
men
in
cities
men
of
the
stupid
political
sort
who
think
in
maps
and
whose
interest
is
in
the
addition
of
numbers
indeed
i
have
heard
such
men
in
london
itself
expressing
pleasure
when
a
gale
came
up
in
april
from
over
the
pines
of
hampshire
and
of
surrey
and
mixed
the
atlantic
with
the
air
of
the
fields
to
me
this
year
the
spring
came
suddenly
like
a
voice
speaking
though
a
low
one
the
voice
of
a
person
subtle
remembered
little
known
and
always
desired
for
a
wind
blew
off
the
land
the
surface
of
the
sea
northward
between
me
and
the
coast
of
sussex
had
been
for
so
many
hours
elastic
smooth
and
dull
that
i
had
come
to
forget
the
indications
of
a
change
but
here
and
there
a
long
way
off
little
lines
began
to
show
which
were
indeed
broad
spaces
of
ruffled
water
seen
edgeways
from
the
low
of
my
boat
these
joined
and
made
a
surface
all
the
way
out
towards
me
but
a
surface
not
yet
revealed
for
what
it
was
nor
showing
the
movement
and
life
and
grace
of
waves
for
no
light
shone
upon
it
and
it
was
not
yet
near
enough
to
be
distinguished
it
grew
rapidly
but
the
haze
and
silence
had
put
me
into
so
dreamy
a
state
that
i
had
forgotten
the
ordinary
anxiety
and
irritation
of
a
calm
nor
had
i
at
the
moment
that
eager
expectancy
of
movement
which
should
accompany
the
sight
of
that
dark
line
upon
the
sea
other
things
possessed
me
the
memory
of
home
and
of
the
downs
there
went
before
this
breeze
as
it
were
attendant
servants
outriders
who
brought
with
them
the
scent
of
those
first
flowers
in
the
north
wood
or
beyond
gumber
corner
and
the
fragrance
of
our
grass
the
savour
which
the
sheep
know
at
least
however
much
the
visitors
to
my
dear
home
ignore
it
a
deeper
sympathy
even
than
that
of
the
senses
came
with
those
messengers
and
brought
me
the
beeches
and
the
yew
trees
also
although
i
was
so
far
out
at
sea
for
the
loneliness
of
this
great
water
recalled
the
loneliness
of
the
woods
and
both
those
solitudes
the
real
and
the
imaginary
mixed
in
my
mind
together
as
they
might
in
the
mind
of
a
sleeping
man
before
this
wind
as
it
approached
the
sky
also
cleared
not
of
clouds
for
there
were
none
but
of
that
impalpable
and
warm
mist
which
seems
to
us
who
know
the
south
country
and
the
channel
to
be
so
often
part
of
the
sky
and
to
shroud
without
obscuring
the
empty
distances
of
our
seas
there
was
a
hard
clear
light
to
the
north
and
even
over
the
downs
low
as
they
were
upon
the
horizon
there
was
a
sharp
belt
of
blue
i
saw
the
sun
strike
the
white
walls
of
lady
newburgh
folly
and
i
saw
what
had
hitherto
been
all
confused
the
long
line
of
the
arundel
woods
contrasting
with
the
plain
then
the
boom
went
over
to
port
the
jib
filled
i
felt
the
helm
pulling
steadily
for
the
first
time
in
so
many
hours
and
the
boat
responded
the
wind
was
on
me
and
though
it
was
from
the
north
that
wind
was
warm
for
it
came
from
the
sheltered
hills
then
indeed
i
quite
forgot
those
first
few
moments
which
had
so
little
to
do
with
the
art
of
sailing
and
which
were
perhaps
unworthy
of
the
full
life
that
goes
with
the
governing
of
sails
and
rudders
for
one
thing
i
was
no
longer
alone
a
man
is
never
alone
with
the
wind
and
the
boat
made
three
there
was
work
to
be
done
in
pressing
against
the
tiller
and
in
bringing
her
up
to
meet
the
seas
small
though
they
were
for
my
boat
was
also
small
life
came
into
everything
the
channel
leapt
and
because
the
wind
was
across
the
tide
the
little
waves
broke
in
small
white
tips
in
their
movement
and
my
own
in
the
dance
of
the
boat
and
the
noise
of
the
shrouds
in
the
curtsy
of
the
long
sprit
that
caught
the
ridges
of
foam
and
lifted
them
in
spray
even
in
the
free
streaming
of
that
loose
untidy
end
of
line
which
played
in
the
air
from
the
leach
as
young
things
play
from
wantonness
in
the
rush
of
the
water
just
up
to
and
sometimes
through
the
lee
scuppers
and
in
the
humming
tautness
of
the
sheet
in
everything
about
me
there
was
exuberance
and
joy
the
sun
upon
the
twenty
million
faces
of
the
waves
made
music
rather
than
laughter
and
the
energy
which
this
first
warmth
of
the
year
had
spread
all
over
the
channel
and
shore
while
it
made
life
one
seemed
also
to
make
it
innumerable
we
were
now
not
only
three
the
wind
and
my
boat
and
i
we
were
all
part
and
masters
for
the
moment
of
a
great
throng
i
knew
them
all
by
their
names
which
i
had
learnt
a
long
time
ago
and
had
sung
of
them
in
the
north
sea
i
have
often
written
them
down
i
will
not
be
ashamed
to
repeat
them
here
for
good
things
never
grow
old
there
was
the
wave
that
brings
good
tidings
and
the
wave
that
breaks
on
the
shore
and
the
wave
of
the
island
and
the
wave
that
helps
and
the
wave
that
lifts
forrard
the
kindly
wave
and
the
youngest
wave
and
amathea
the
wave
with
bright
hair
all
the
waves
that
come
up
round
thetis
in
her
train
when
she
rises
from
the
side
of
the
old
man
her
father
where
he
sits
on
his
throne
in
the
depth
of
the
sea
when
she
comes
up
cleaving
the
water
and
appears
to
her
sons
in
the
upper
world
the
wight
showed
clear
before
me
i
was
certain
with
the
tide
of
making
the
horse
buoy
and
spithead
while
it
was
yet
afternoon
and
before
the
plenitude
of
that
light
and
movement
should
have
left
me
i
settled
down
to
so
much
and
such
exalted
delight
as
to
a
settled
task
i
lit
my
pipe
for
a
further
companion
since
it
was
good
to
add
even
to
so
many
i
kept
my
right
shoulder
only
against
the
tiller
for
the
pressure
was
now
steady
and
sound
i
felt
the
wind
grow
heavy
and
equable
and
i
caught
over
my
shoulder
the
merry
wake
of
this
very
honest
moving
home
of
mine
as
she
breasted
and
hissed
through
the
sea
here
then
was
the
proper
end
of
a
long
cruise
it
was
springtime
and
the
season
for
work
on
land
i
had
been
told
so
by
the
heartening
wind
and
as
i
went
still
westward
remembering
the
duties
of
the
land
the
sails
still
held
full
the
sheets
and
the
weather
shrouds
still
stood
taut
and
straining
and
the
little
clatter
of
the
broken
water
spoke
along
the
lee
rail
and
so
the
ship
sailed
on
greek

the
canigou
a
man
might
discuss
with
himself
what
it
was
that
made
certain
great
sights
of
the
world
famous
and
what
it
is
that
keeps
others
hidden
this
would
be
especially
interesting
in
the
case
of
mountains
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
modern
attraction
in
mountains
which
may
not
endure
but
which
is
almost
as
intense
in
our
generation
as
it
was
in
that
of
our
fathers
the
emotion
produced
by
great
height
and
by
the
something
unique
and
inspiring
which
distinguishes
a
mountain
from
a
hill
has
bitten
deeply
into
the
modern
mind
yet
there
are
some
of
the
most
astounding
visions
of
this
sort
in
europe
which
are
and
will
probably
remain
unemphasised
for
travellers
the
vision
of
the
berenese
oberland
when
it
breaks
upon
one
from
the
crest
of
jura
has
been
impressed
upon
english
people
at
least
in
two
fine
passages
the
one
written
by
ruskin
the
other
if
i
remember
right
in
a
book
called
cruise
upon
the
french
have
i
believe
no
classical
presentment
of
that
view
nor
perhaps
have
the
germans
the
line
of
the
alps
as
one
sees
it
upon
very
clear
days
from
the
last
of
the
apennines
this
i
think
has
never
been
properly
praised
in
any
modern
book
not
even
an
italian
the
great
red
which
bruno
called
the
desert
i
do
not
remember
to
have
read
of
anywhere
nor
to
have
heard
described
for
it
stands
above
an
unfrequented
valley
and
the
regular
approach
to
the
chartreuse
is
from
the
other
side
yet
it
is
something
which
remains
as
vivid
to
those
few
who
have
suddenly
caught
sight
of
it
from
a
turn
of
the
old
lyons
road
as
though
they
had
seen
it
in
a
fantastic
dream
that
astonishing
circle
of
cliffs
which
surrounds
bourg
though
it
has
been
written
of
now
and
then
has
not
so
to
speak
taken
root
in
imagination
even
in
this
country
there
are
twenty
great
effects
which
though
they
have
of
course
suffered
record
are
still
secure
from
general
praise
for
instance
that
awful
trench
which
opens
under
your
feet
as
it
were
up
north
and
beyond
plynlimmon
it
is
a
valley
as
unexpected
and
as
incredible
in
its
steepness
and
complete
isolation
as
any
one
may
see
in
the
drawings
of
the
romantic
generation
of
english
yet
perhaps
no
one
has
drawn
it
there
is
certainly
no
familiar
picture
of
it
anywhere
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
the
reason
of
such
exceptions
to
fame
as
are
these
is
usually
that
such
and
such
an
unknown
but
great
sight
lies
off
the
few
general
roads
of
travel
it
is
a
vulgar
reason
but
the
true
one
unless
men
go
to
a
mountain
to
climb
because
it
is
difficult
to
climb
or
unless
it
often
appears
before
them
along
one
of
their
main
journeys
it
will
remain
quiet
among
such
masses
is
the
canigou
here
is
a
mountain
which
may
be
compared
to
etna
it
is
lower
indeed
in
the
proportion
of
nine
to
eleven
but
when
great
isolated
heights
of
this
sort
are
in
question
such
a
difference
hardly
counts
it
can
be
seen
as
etna
can
from
the
sea
though
it
stands
a
good
deal
more
inland
it
dominates
as
etna
does
a
very
famous
plain
but
modern
travel
does
nothing
to
bring
it
into
the
general
consciousness
of
the
world
if
spain
were
wealthy
or
if
the
spanish
harbours
naturally
led
to
any
place
which
all
the
rich
desired
to
visit
the
name
of
the
canigou
would
begin
to
grow
where
the
railway
skirts
the
sea
from
narbonne
to
barcelona
it
is
your
permanent
companion
for
a
good
hour
in
the
express
and
for
any
time
you
like
in
the
ordinary
trains
during
at
least
three
months
in
the
year
its
isolation
is
peculiarly
relieved
and
marked
by
the
snow
which
lies
above
an
even
line
all
along
its
vast
bulk
it
is
also
one
of
those
mountains
in
which
one
can
recognise
the
curious
regularity
of
the
belts
which
talk
of
there
are
great
forests
at
the
base
of
it
just
above
the
hot
mediterranean
plain
the
beech
comes
higher
than
the
olive
the
pines
last
of
all
after
them
the
pastures
and
the
rocks
in
the
end
of
february
a
man
climbs
up
from
a
spring
that
is
as
southern
as
africa
to
a
winter
that
is
as
northern
as
the
highlands
of
scotland
and
all
the
while
he
feels
that
he
is
climbing
nothing
confused
or
vague
but
one
individual
peak
which
is
the
genius
of
the
whole
countryside
this
countryside
is
the
roussillon
a
lordship
as
united
as
the
cerdagne
it
speaks
one
language
shows
one
type
of
face
and
is
approached
by
but
a
small
group
of
roads
and
each
road
passes
through
a
mountain
gap
for
centuries
it
went
with
barcelona
it
needed
the
revolution
to
make
it
french
and
it
is
full
of
spanish
memories
to
this
day
for
the
roussillon
depends
upon
the
canigou
just
as
the
bay
of
syracuse
depends
upon
etna
or
that
of
naples
upon
vesuvius
and
its
familiar
presence
has
sunk
into
the
patriotism
of
the
roussillon
people
as
those
more
famous
mountains
have
into
the
art
and
legends
of
their
neighbours
there
are
i
know
not
how
many
monographs
upon
the
canigou
but
not
one
has
been
translated
i
would
wager
into
any
foreign
language
yet
it
is
the
mountain
which
very
many
men
who
have
hardly
heard
its
name
have
been
looking
for
all
their
lives
it
gives
as
good
camping
as
is
to
be
had
in
the
whole
of
the
pyrenees
i
believe
there
is
fishing
and
perhaps
one
can
shoot
properly
speaking
there
is
no
climbing
in
it
at
least
one
can
walk
up
it
all
the
way
if
one
chooses
the
right
path
but
there
is
everything
else
men
look
for
when
they
escape
from
cities
it
is
so
big
that
you
would
never
learn
it
in
any
number
of
camps
and
the
change
of
its
impressions
is
perpetual
from
the
summit
the
view
has
two
interests
of
colour
and
of
the
past
you
have
below
you
a
plain
like
an
inlaid
work
of
chosen
stones
the
whole
field
is
an
arrangement
of
different
culture
and
of
bright
rocks
and
sand
and
below
you
also
in
a
curve
is
all
that
coast
which
at
the
close
of
the
roman
empire
was
perhaps
the
wealthiest
in
europe
in
the
extreme
north
a
man
might
make
out
upon
a
clear
day
the
bulk
of
narbonne
perpignan
is
close
by
the
little
rock
harbour
of
venus
port
vendres
is
to
the
south
from
the
plain
below
one
which
has
always
been
crammed
with
riches
sprang
the
chief
influences
of
southern
gaul
it
was
here
that
the
family
of
charlemagne
took
its
origin
and
it
was
perhaps
from
here
that
he
saw
through
the
windows
of
a
palace
that
fleet
of
pirates
which
moved
him
to
his
sad
prophecy
that
plain
moreover
will
it
is
still
rich
and
all
the
catalan
province
of
spain
below
it
of
which
it
is
the
highway
and
the
approach
must
increase
in
value
before
europe
from
year
to
year
the
vast
development
of
the
french
african
territory
is
reacting
upon
that
coast
all
it
needs
is
a
central
harbour
and
if
that
harbour
were
formed
it
would
do
what
narbo
did
for
the
romans
at
the
end
of
their
occupation
it
would
tap
much
better
than
does
cette
the
wealth
of
gascony
perhaps
also
an
atlantic
trade
and
its
exchanges
towards
africa
and
the
levant
the
mediterranean
which
is
perpetually
increasing
in
wealth
and
in
importance
would
have
a
second
marseilles
and
should
such
a
port
arise
then
when
our
ships
and
our
travellers
are
familiar
with
it
the
canigou
if
it
cares
for
that
sort
of
thing
will
be
as
happy
as
the
matterhorn
for
the
present
it
is
all
alone
the
man
and
his
wood
i
knew
a
man
once
that
was
a
territorial
magnate
and
had
an
estate
in
the
county
of
berkshire
i
will
not
conceal
his
name
it
was
william
frederick
charles
on
his
estate
was
a
large
family
mansion
surrounded
by
tasteful
gardens
of
a
charming
old
kind
and
next
outside
these
a
great
park
well
timbered
but
the
thing
i
am
going
to
talk
about
was
a
certain
wood
of
which
he
was
rightly
very
proud
it
stood
on
the
slope
of
a
grass
down
just
above
the
valley
and
beneath
it
was
a
clean
white
road
and
a
little
way
along
that
a
town
part
of
which
belonged
to
part
to
a
local
solicitor
and
moneylender
several
bits
to
a
brewer
in
reading
and
a
few
houses
to
the
inhabitants
the
people
in
the
town
were
also
fond
of
the
wood
and
called
it
the
old
wood
it
was
not
very
large
but
as
i
have
said
before
it
was
very
beautiful
and
contained
all
manner
of
trees
but
especially
beeches
under
which
nothing
will
grow
as
the
poet
puts
it
in
sussex
unner
t
beech
and
t
yow
nowt
grow
well
as
years
passed
became
fonder
and
fonder
of
the
wood
he
began
towards
to
think
it
the
nicest
thing
on
his
estate
which
it
was
and
he
would
often
ride
out
to
look
at
it
of
a
morning
on
his
grey
mare
betsy
when
he
rode
out
like
this
of
a
morning
his
mount
was
well
groomed
and
so
was
he
however
early
it
might
be
and
he
would
carry
a
little
cane
to
hit
the
mare
with
and
also
as
a
symbol
of
authority
the
people
who
met
him
would
touch
their
foreheads
and
he
would
wave
his
hand
genially
in
reply
he
was
a
good
fellow
but
the
principal
thing
about
him
was
his
care
for
the
old
wood
and
when
he
rode
out
to
look
at
it
as
i
say
he
would
speak
to
any
one
around
so
early
his
bailiff
as
might
be
or
sometimes
his
agent
or
even
the
foreman
of
the
workshop
or
the
carpenter
or
any
hedger
or
ditcher
that
might
be
there
and
point
out
bits
of
the
wood
and
say
that
branch
looks
pretty
dicky
no
harm
to
cut
that
off
short
and
parcel
and
serve
the
end
and
cap
it
with
a
zinc
cap
or
better
be
cutting
the
yartle
bush
for
the
next
fallow
it
chokes
the
and
i
do
like
to
see
so
much
standard
ivy
about
it
the
death
of
trees
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
got
the
technical
words
right
but
at
any
rate
they
were
more
or
less
like
that
for
i
have
heard
him
myself
time
and
again
i
often
used
to
go
out
with
him
on
another
horse
called
sultan
which
he
lent
me
to
ride
upon
well
he
got
fonder
and
fonder
of
this
wood
and
kept
on
asking
people
what
he
should
do
and
how
one
could
make
most
use
of
it
and
he
worried
a
good
deal
about
it
he
reads
books
about
woods
and
in
the
opening
of
he
had
down
to
stay
with
him
for
a
few
days
a
man
called
churt
who
had
made
a
great
success
with
woods
on
the
but
churt
was
a
vulgar
fellow
and
so
wife
lady
gywnnys
would
not
have
him
in
the
house
again
which
was
a
bother
her
husband
then
rode
over
to
see
another
man
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
he
put
up
a
great
board
saying
trespassers
in
this
wood
will
be
prosecuted
and
it
might
as
well
not
have
been
put
up
for
no
one
ever
went
into
the
wood
not
even
from
the
little
town
because
it
was
too
far
for
them
to
walk
and
anyhow
they
did
not
care
for
walking
and
as
for
the
doctor
son
a
boy
of
thirteen
who
went
in
there
with
an
to
shoot
things
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
board
the
next
thing
my
friend
did
was
to
have
a
fine
strong
paling
put
all
round
the
wood
in
march
this
paling
was
of
oak
it
was
seven
feet
high
it
had
iron
spikes
along
the
top
there
were
six
gates
in
it
and
stout
posts
at
intervals
of
ten
yards
the
boards
overlapped
very
exactly
it
was
as
good
a
bit
of
work
as
ever
i
saw
he
had
it
varnished
and
it
looked
splendid
all
this
took
two
years
just
then
he
was
elected
to
parliament
not
for
berkshire
as
you
might
have
imagined
but
for
a
slum
division
of
birmingham
he
was
very
proud
of
this
and
quite
rightly
too
he
said
i
am
the
one
conservative
member
in
the
midlands
it
almost
made
him
forget
about
his
wood
he
shut
up
the
berkshire
place
and
took
a
house
in
town
and
as
he
could
not
afford
mayfair
and
did
not
understand
such
things
very
well
the
house
he
took
was
an
enormous
empty
house
in
bayswater
and
he
had
no
peace
until
he
gave
it
up
for
a
set
of
rooms
off
piccadilly
and
then
his
mother
thought
that
looked
so
odd
that
he
did
the
right
thing
and
got
into
a
nice
furnished
house
in
westminster
overlooking
the
green
park
but
all
this
cost
him
a
mint
of
money
and
politics
made
him
angrier
and
angrier
they
never
let
him
speak
and
they
made
him
vote
for
things
he
thought
perfectly
detestable
then
he
did
speak
and
as
he
was
an
honest
english
gentleman
the
papers
called
him
ridiculous
names
and
said
he
had
no
brains
so
he
just
jolly
well
threw
the
whole
thing
up
and
went
back
to
berkshire
and
everybody
welcomed
him
and
he
did
a
thing
he
had
never
done
before
he
put
a
flag
up
over
his
house
to
show
he
was
at
home
then
he
began
to
think
of
his
wood
again
the
very
first
time
he
rode
out
to
look
at
it
he
found
the
paling
had
given
way
in
places
from
the
fall
of
trees
and
that
some
leaned
inwards
and
some
outwards
and
that
one
of
the
gates
was
off
its
hinges
there
were
also
two
cows
walking
about
in
the
wood
and
what
annoyed
him
most
of
all
the
iron
spikes
were
rusty
and
the
varnish
had
all
gone
rotten
and
white
and
streaky
on
the
palings
he
spoke
to
the
bailiff
about
this
and
hauled
him
out
to
look
at
it
the
bailiff
rubbed
the
varnish
with
his
finger
smelt
it
and
said
that
it
had
perished
he
also
said
there
was
no
such
thing
as
good
varnish
nowadays
and
he
added
there
was
any
varnish
not
the
very
best
but
would
go
like
that
with
rain
and
all
grumbled
a
good
deal
but
he
supposed
the
bailiff
knew
best
so
he
told
him
to
see
what
could
be
done
and
for
several
weeks
he
heard
no
more
about
it
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
about
this
time
the
south
african
war
had
broken
out
and
as
things
were
getting
pretty
tangled
went
out
with
his
regiment
the
eighth
battalion
not
of
the
berkshire
but
of
the
orkney
regiment
while
he
was
out
there
his
brother
in
charlbury
home
died
and
he
succeeded
to
the
baronetcy
as
he
already
had
a
and
was
now
given
a
as
well
as
being
one
of
the
people
mentioned
in
dispatches
he
was
pretty
important
by
the
time
he
came
home
when
the
war
was
over
just
before
the
elections
of
when
he
got
home
he
had
a
splendid
welcome
both
from
his
tenants
in
berkshire
in
passing
through
and
from
those
of
his
late
brother
in
the
big
place
in
worcestershire
he
preferred
his
berkshire
place
however
and
letting
the
big
place
to
an
american
of
the
name
of
hendrik
boulge
he
went
back
to
his
first
home
when
he
got
there
he
thought
of
the
old
wood
and
went
out
to
look
at
it
the
palings
were
mended
but
they
were
covered
all
over
with
tar
he
was
exceedingly
angry
and
ordered
them
to
be
painted
at
once
but
the
bailiff
assured
him
one
could
not
paint
over
tar
and
so
did
the
carpenter
and
the
foreman
at
this
he
had
a
fit
of
rage
and
ordered
the
whole
damned
thing
to
be
pulled
down
and
swore
he
would
be
damned
if
he
ever
had
a
damned
stick
or
a
rail
round
the
damned
wood
again
he
was
no
longer
young
he
was
getting
stout
and
rather
puffy
he
was
not
so
reasonable
as
of
old
anyhow
he
had
the
whole
thing
pulled
down
next
year
that
is
in
his
wife
died
i
wish
i
had
the
space
to
tell
you
all
the
other
things
he
did
to
the
wood
how
a
friend
of
his
having
sold
a
similar
wood
on
the
thames
in
building
lots
at
an
acre
he
put
up
the
whole
wood
at
the
same
rate
how
the
whole
wood
being
acres
in
extent
he
hoped
to
make
out
of
it
how
he
thought
this
a
tidy
sum
how
he
got
no
offers
at
this
price
nor
at
nor
at
how
an
artist
offered
him
for
half
an
acre
to
put
up
a
red
tin
bungalow
upon
how
he
lost
his
temper
with
the
artist
how
at
last
he
left
the
whole
thing
alone
and
tried
to
forget
all
about
it
the
old
wood
is
just
like
what
it
was
when
i
wandered
in
it
as
a
boy
the
doctor
son
is
a
man
now
and
is
keeping
a
bar
in
sydney
so
he
is
gone
the
townspeople
do
come
any
more
than
before
i
am
the
only
person
who
goes
near
the
place
the
trees
are
a
trifle
grander
i
happen
now
and
then
when
i
visit
this
berkshire
parish
upon
a
stump
of
a
post
or
an
old
spike
in
the
grass
of
this
wood
but
otherwise
it
is
as
though
all
this
had
not
been
a
solemn
thought
how
enduring
are
the
works
of
nature
how
perishable
those
of
man
the
channel
friends
of
mine
friends
all
and
you
also
publishers
colonials
and
critics
do
you
know
that
particular
experience
for
which
i
am
trying
to
find
words
do
you
know
that
glamour
in
the
mind
which
arises
and
transforms
our
thought
when
we
see
the
things
that
the
men
who
made
us
saw
the
things
of
a
long
time
ago
the
origins
i
think
everybody
knows
that
glamour
but
very
few
people
know
where
to
find
it
every
man
knows
that
he
has
in
him
the
power
for
such
revelations
and
every
man
wonders
in
what
strange
place
he
may
come
upon
them
there
are
men
also
very
rich
who
have
considered
all
the
world
and
wandered
over
it
seeking
those
first
experiences
and
trying
to
feel
as
felt
the
earlier
men
in
a
happier
time
yet
these
few
rich
men
have
not
felt
and
have
not
so
found
the
things
which
they
desire
i
have
known
men
who
have
thought
to
find
them
in
the
mountains
but
would
not
climb
them
simply
enough
and
refused
to
leave
their
luxuries
behind
and
so
lost
everything
and
might
as
well
have
been
walking
in
a
dirty
town
at
home
for
all
the
little
good
that
the
mountains
did
to
them
and
i
know
men
who
have
thought
to
find
this
memory
and
desire
in
foreign
countries
in
africa
hunting
great
beasts
such
as
our
fathers
hunted
yet
even
these
have
not
relit
those
old
embers
which
if
they
lie
dead
and
dark
in
a
man
make
his
whole
soul
dusty
and
useless
but
which
if
they
be
once
rekindled
can
make
him
part
of
all
the
centuries
yet
there
is
a
simple
and
an
easy
way
to
find
what
the
men
who
made
us
found
and
to
see
the
world
as
they
saw
it
and
to
take
a
bath
as
it
were
in
the
freshness
of
beginnings
and
that
is
to
go
to
work
as
cheaply
and
as
hardly
as
you
can
and
only
as
much
away
from
men
as
they
were
away
from
men
and
not
to
read
or
to
write
or
to
think
but
to
eat
and
drink
and
use
the
body
in
many
immediate
ways
which
are
at
the
feet
of
every
man
every
man
who
will
walk
for
some
days
carelessly
sleeping
rough
when
he
must
or
in
poor
inns
and
making
for
some
one
place
direct
because
he
desires
to
see
it
will
know
the
thing
i
mean
and
there
is
a
better
way
still
of
which
i
shall
now
speak
i
mean
to
try
the
seas
in
a
little
boat
not
more
than
feet
long
preferably
decked
of
shallow
draught
such
as
can
enter
into
all
creeks
and
havens
and
so
simply
rigged
that
by
oneself
or
with
a
friend
at
most
one
can
wander
all
over
the
world
certainly
every
man
that
goes
to
sea
in
a
little
boat
of
this
kind
learns
terror
and
salvation
happy
living
air
danger
exultation
glory
and
repose
at
the
end
and
they
are
not
words
to
him
but
on
the
contrary
realities
which
will
afterwards
throughout
his
life
give
the
mere
words
a
full
meaning
and
for
this
experiment
there
lies
at
our
feet
i
say
the
channel
it
is
the
most
marvellous
sea
in
the
world
the
most
suited
for
these
little
adventures
it
is
crammed
with
strange
towns
differing
one
from
the
other
it
has
two
opposite
people
upon
either
side
and
hills
and
varying
climates
and
the
hundred
shapes
and
colours
of
the
earth
here
rocks
there
sand
there
cliffs
and
there
marshy
shores
it
is
a
little
world
and
what
is
more
it
is
a
kind
of
inland
sea
people
will
not
understand
how
narrow
it
is
crossing
it
hurriedly
in
great
steamships
nor
will
they
make
it
a
home
for
pleasure
unless
they
are
rich
and
can
have
great
boats
yet
they
should
for
on
its
water
lies
the
best
stage
for
playing
out
the
old
drama
by
which
the
soul
of
a
healthy
man
is
kept
alive
for
instance
listen
to
this
story
the
sea
being
calm
and
the
wind
hot
uncertain
and
light
from
the
east
leaving
oily
gaps
on
the
water
and
continually
dying
down
i
drifted
one
morning
in
the
strong
ebb
to
the
south
goodwin
lightship
wondering
what
to
do
there
was
a
haze
over
the
land
and
over
the
sea
and
through
the
haze
great
ships
a
long
way
off
showed
one
or
two
of
them
like
oblong
targets
which
one
fires
at
with
guns
they
hardly
moved
in
spite
of
all
their
canvas
set
there
was
so
little
breeze
so
i
drifted
in
the
slow
ebb
past
the
south
goodwin
and
i
thought
what
is
all
this
drifting
and
doing
nothing
let
us
play
the
fool
and
see
if
there
are
no
adventures
left
so
i
put
my
little
boat
about
until
the
wind
took
her
from
forward
such
as
it
was
and
she
crawled
out
to
sea
it
was
a
dull
uneasy
morning
hot
and
silent
and
the
wind
i
say
was
hardly
a
wind
and
most
of
the
time
the
sails
flapped
uselessly
but
after
eleven
the
wind
first
rose
and
then
shifted
a
little
and
then
blew
light
but
steady
and
then
at
last
she
heeled
and
the
water
spoke
under
her
bows
and
still
she
heeled
and
ran
until
in
the
haze
i
could
see
no
more
land
but
ever
so
far
out
there
were
no
seas
for
the
light
full
breeze
was
with
the
tide
the
tide
ebbing
out
as
a
strong
and
silent
as
a
man
in
anger
down
the
hidden
parallel
valleys
of
the
narrow
sea
and
i
held
this
little
wind
till
about
two
when
i
drank
wine
and
ate
bread
and
meat
at
the
tiller
for
i
had
them
by
me
and
just
afterwards
still
through
a
thick
haze
of
heat
i
saw
a
huge
ghost
right
up
against
and
above
me
and
i
wondered
for
i
had
crossed
the
channel
now
for
the
first
time
and
knew
now
what
it
felt
like
to
see
new
land
though
i
knew
nothing
of
the
place
i
had
this
much
sense
that
i
said
to
myself
the
tide
is
channel
racing
through
the
hidden
valleys
under
the
narrow
sea
so
it
will
all
go
down
together
and
all
come
up
together
and
the
flood
will
come
on
this
foreign
side
much
at
the
same
hour
that
it
does
on
the
home
side
my
boat
lay
to
the
east
and
the
ebb
tide
held
her
down
and
i
lit
a
pipe
and
looked
at
the
french
hills
and
thought
about
them
and
the
people
in
them
and
england
which
i
had
left
behind
and
i
was
delighted
with
the
loneliness
of
the
sea
and
still
i
waited
for
the
flood
but
in
a
little
while
the
chain
made
a
rattling
noise
and
she
lay
quite
slack
and
swung
oddly
and
then
there
were
little
boiling
and
eddying
places
in
the
water
and
the
water
seemed
to
come
up
from
underneath
sometimes
and
altogether
it
behaved
very
strangely
and
this
was
the
turn
of
the
tide
then
the
wind
dropped
also
and
for
a
moment
she
lollopped
about
till
at
last
after
i
had
gone
below
and
straightened
things
i
came
on
deck
to
see
that
she
had
turned
completely
round
and
that
the
tide
at
last
was
making
up
my
way
towards
calais
and
her
chain
was
taut
and
her
nose
pointed
down
channel
and
a
little
westerly
breeze
a
little
draught
of
air
came
up
cool
along
the
tide
when
this
came
i
was
very
glad
for
i
saw
that
i
could
end
my
adventure
before
night
so
i
pulled
up
the
anchor
and
fished
it
and
then
turned
with
the
tide
under
me
and
the
slight
breeze
just
barely
filling
the
mainsail
the
sheet
was
slack
so
powerless
was
the
wind
and
i
ran
up
along
that
high
coast
watching
eagerly
every
new
thing
but
i
kept
some
way
out
for
fear
of
shoals
till
after
three
good
hours
under
the
reclining
sun
of
afternoon
which
glorified
the
mist
i
saw
far
off
the
roofs
and
spires
of
a
town
and
a
low
pier
running
well
out
to
sea
and
i
knew
that
it
must
be
calais
and
i
ran
for
these
piers
careless
of
how
i
went
for
it
was
already
half
of
the
spring
flood
tide
and
everything
was
surely
well
covered
for
so
small
a
boat
and
i
ran
up
the
fairway
in
between
the
piers
and
saw
frenchmen
walking
about
and
a
great
gun
peeping
up
over
its
earthwork
and
plenty
of
clean
new
masonry
and
a
man
came
along
and
showed
me
where
i
could
lie
but
i
was
so
strange
to
the
place
that
i
would
not
take
a
berth
but
lay
that
night
moored
to
an
english
ship
and
when
i
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
everything
was
stowed
away
and
darkness
had
fallen
i
went
on
deck
and
for
a
long
time
sat
silent
smoking
a
pipe
and
watching
the
enormous
lighthouse
of
calais
which
is
built
right
in
the
town
and
which
turns
round
and
round
above
one
all
night
long
and
i
thought
here
is
a
wonderful
thing
i
have
crossed
the
channel
in
this
little
boat
and
i
know
now
what
the
sea
means
that
separates
france
from
england
i
have
strained
my
eyes
for
shore
through
a
haze
i
have
seen
new
lands
and
i
feel
as
men
do
who
have
dreamt
dreams
but
in
reality
i
had
had
very
great
luck
indeed
and
had
had
no
right
to
cross
for
my
coming
back
was
to
be
far
more
difficult
and
dreadful
and
i
was
to
suffer
many
things
before
again
i
could
see
tall
england
close
by
me
out
of
the
sea
but
how
i
came
back
and
of
the
storm
and
of
its
majesty
and
of
how
the
boat
and
i
survived
i
will
tell
you
another
time
only
imploring
you
to
do
the
same
not
to
tell
of
it
i
mean
but
to
sail
it
in
a
little
boat
the
mowing
of
a
field
there
is
a
valley
in
south
england
remote
from
ambition
and
from
fear
where
the
passage
of
strangers
is
rare
and
unperceived
and
where
the
scent
of
the
grass
in
summer
is
breathed
only
by
those
who
are
native
to
that
unvisited
land
the
roads
to
the
channel
do
not
traverse
it
they
choose
upon
either
side
easier
passes
over
the
range
one
track
alone
leads
up
through
it
to
the
hills
and
this
is
changeable
now
green
where
men
have
little
occasion
to
go
now
a
good
road
where
it
nears
the
homesteads
and
the
barns
the
woods
grow
steep
above
the
slopes
they
reach
sometimes
the
very
summit
of
the
heights
or
when
they
can
not
attain
them
fill
in
and
clothe
the
coombes
and
in
between
along
the
floor
of
the
valley
deep
pastures
and
their
silence
are
bordered
by
lawns
of
chalky
grass
and
the
small
yew
trees
of
the
downs
the
clouds
that
visit
its
sky
reveal
themselves
beyond
the
one
great
rise
and
sail
white
and
enormous
to
the
other
and
sink
beyond
that
other
but
the
plains
above
which
they
have
travelled
and
the
weald
to
which
they
go
the
people
of
the
valley
can
not
see
and
hardly
recall
the
wind
when
it
reaches
such
fields
is
no
longer
a
gale
from
the
salt
but
fruitful
and
soft
an
inland
breeze
and
those
whose
blood
was
nourished
here
feel
in
that
wind
the
fruitfulness
of
our
orchards
and
all
the
life
that
all
things
draw
from
the
air
in
this
place
when
i
was
a
boy
i
pushed
through
a
fringe
of
beeches
that
made
a
complete
screen
between
me
and
the
world
and
i
came
to
a
glade
called
no
man
land
i
climbed
beyond
it
and
i
was
surprised
and
glad
because
from
the
ridge
of
that
glade
i
saw
the
sea
to
this
place
very
lately
i
returned
the
many
things
that
i
recovered
as
i
came
up
the
countryside
were
not
less
charming
than
when
a
distant
memory
had
enshrined
them
but
much
more
whatever
veil
is
thrown
by
a
longing
recollection
had
not
intensified
nor
even
made
more
mysterious
the
beauty
of
that
happy
ground
not
in
my
very
dreams
of
morning
had
i
in
exile
seen
it
more
beloved
or
more
rare
much
also
that
i
had
forgotten
now
returned
to
me
as
i
approached
a
group
of
elms
a
little
turn
of
the
parson
wall
a
small
paddock
beyond
the
graveyard
close
cherished
by
one
man
with
a
low
wall
of
very
old
stone
guarding
it
all
round
and
all
these
things
fulfilled
and
amplified
my
delight
till
even
the
good
vision
of
the
place
which
i
had
kept
so
many
years
left
me
and
was
replaced
by
its
better
reality
here
i
said
to
myself
is
a
symbol
of
what
some
say
is
reserved
for
the
soul
pleasure
of
a
kind
which
can
not
be
imagined
save
in
a
moment
when
at
last
it
is
attained
when
i
came
to
my
own
gate
and
my
own
field
and
had
before
me
the
house
i
knew
i
looked
around
a
little
though
it
was
already
evening
and
i
saw
that
the
grass
was
standing
as
it
should
stand
when
it
is
ready
for
the
scythe
for
in
this
as
in
everything
that
a
man
can
do
of
those
things
at
least
which
are
very
old
there
is
an
exact
moment
when
they
are
done
best
and
it
has
been
remarked
of
whatever
rules
us
that
it
works
blunderingly
seeing
that
the
good
things
given
to
a
man
are
not
given
at
the
precise
moment
when
they
would
have
filled
him
with
delight
but
whether
this
be
true
or
false
we
can
choose
the
just
turn
of
the
seasons
in
everything
we
do
of
our
own
will
and
especially
in
the
making
of
hay
many
think
that
hay
is
best
made
when
the
grass
is
thickest
and
so
they
delay
until
it
is
rank
and
in
flower
and
has
already
heavily
pulled
the
ground
and
there
is
another
false
reason
for
delay
which
is
wet
weather
for
very
few
will
understand
though
it
comes
year
after
year
that
we
have
rain
always
in
south
england
between
the
sickle
and
the
scythe
or
say
just
after
the
weeks
of
east
wind
are
over
first
we
have
a
week
of
sudden
warmth
as
though
the
south
had
come
to
see
us
all
then
we
have
the
weeks
of
east
and
wind
and
then
we
have
more
or
less
of
that
rain
of
which
i
spoke
and
which
always
astonishes
the
world
now
it
is
just
before
or
during
or
at
the
very
end
of
that
rain
but
not
later
that
grass
should
be
cut
for
hay
true
upland
grass
which
is
always
thin
should
be
cut
earlier
than
the
grass
in
the
bottoms
and
along
the
water
meadows
but
not
even
the
latest
even
in
the
wettest
seasons
should
be
left
as
it
is
to
flower
and
even
to
seed
for
what
we
get
when
we
store
our
grass
is
not
a
harvest
of
something
ripe
but
a
thing
just
caught
in
its
prime
before
maturity
as
witness
that
our
corn
and
straw
are
best
yellow
but
our
hay
is
best
green
so
also
death
should
be
represented
with
a
scythe
and
time
with
a
sickle
for
time
can
take
only
what
is
ripe
but
death
comes
always
too
soon
in
a
word
then
it
is
always
much
easier
to
cut
grass
too
late
than
too
early
and
i
under
that
evening
and
come
back
to
these
pleasant
fields
looked
at
the
grass
and
knew
that
it
was
time
june
was
in
full
advance
it
was
the
beginning
of
that
season
when
the
night
has
already
lost
her
foothold
of
the
earth
and
hovers
over
it
never
quite
descending
but
mixing
sunset
with
the
dawn
next
morning
before
it
was
yet
broad
day
i
awoke
and
thought
of
the
mowing
the
birds
were
already
chattering
in
the
trees
beside
my
window
all
except
the
nightingale
which
had
left
and
flown
away
to
the
weald
where
he
sings
all
summer
by
day
as
well
as
by
night
in
the
oaks
and
the
hazel
spinneys
and
especially
along
the
little
river
adur
one
of
the
rivers
of
the
weald
the
birds
and
the
thought
of
the
mowing
had
awakened
me
and
i
went
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
stone
floors
to
where
i
could
find
a
scythe
and
when
i
took
it
from
its
nail
i
remembered
how
fourteen
years
ago
i
had
last
gone
out
with
my
scythe
just
so
into
the
fields
at
morning
in
between
that
day
and
this
were
many
things
cities
and
armies
and
a
confusion
of
books
mountains
and
the
desert
and
horrible
great
breadths
of
sea
when
i
got
out
into
the
long
grass
the
sun
was
not
yet
risen
but
there
were
already
many
colours
in
the
eastern
sky
and
i
made
haste
to
sharpen
my
scythe
so
that
i
might
get
to
the
cutting
before
the
dew
should
dry
some
say
that
it
is
best
to
wait
till
all
the
dew
has
risen
so
as
to
get
the
grass
quite
dry
from
the
very
first
but
though
it
is
an
advantage
to
get
the
grass
quite
dry
yet
it
is
not
worth
while
to
wait
till
the
dew
has
risen
for
in
the
first
place
you
lose
many
hours
of
work
and
those
the
coolest
and
next
which
is
more
important
you
lose
that
great
ease
and
thickness
in
cutting
which
comes
of
the
dew
so
i
at
once
began
to
sharpen
my
scythe
there
is
an
art
also
in
the
sharpening
of
a
scythe
and
it
is
worth
describing
carefully
your
blade
must
be
dry
and
that
is
why
you
will
see
men
rubbing
the
with
grass
before
they
whet
it
then
also
your
rubber
must
be
quite
dry
and
on
this
account
it
is
a
good
thing
to
lay
it
on
your
coat
and
keep
it
there
during
all
your
mowing
the
scythe
you
stand
upright
with
the
blade
pointing
away
from
you
and
you
put
your
left
hand
firmly
on
the
back
of
the
blade
grasping
it
then
you
pass
the
rubber
first
down
one
side
of
the
and
then
down
the
other
beginning
near
the
handle
and
going
on
to
the
point
and
working
quickly
and
hard
when
you
first
do
this
you
will
perhaps
cut
your
hand
but
it
is
only
at
first
that
such
an
accident
will
happen
to
you
to
tell
when
the
scythe
is
sharp
enough
this
is
the
rule
first
the
stone
clangs
and
grinds
against
the
iron
harshly
then
it
rings
musically
to
one
note
then
at
last
it
purrs
as
though
the
iron
and
stone
were
exactly
suited
when
you
hear
this
your
scythe
is
sharp
enough
and
i
when
i
heard
it
that
june
dawn
with
everything
quite
silent
except
the
birds
let
down
the
scythe
and
bent
myself
to
mow
when
one
does
anything
anew
after
so
many
years
one
fears
very
much
for
one
trick
or
habit
but
all
things
once
learnt
are
easily
recoverable
and
i
very
soon
recovered
the
swing
and
power
of
the
mower
mowing
well
and
mowing
badly
or
rather
not
mowing
at
all
are
separated
by
very
little
as
is
also
true
of
writing
verse
of
playing
the
fiddle
and
of
dozens
of
other
things
but
of
nothing
more
than
of
believing
for
the
bad
or
young
or
untaught
mower
without
tradition
the
mower
promethean
the
mower
original
and
contemptuous
of
the
past
does
all
these
things
he
leaves
great
crescents
of
grass
uncut
he
digs
the
point
of
the
scythe
hard
into
the
ground
with
a
jerk
he
loosens
the
handles
and
even
the
fastening
of
the
blade
he
twists
the
blade
with
his
blunders
he
blunts
the
blade
he
chips
it
dulls
it
or
breaks
it
clean
off
at
the
tip
if
any
one
is
standing
by
he
cuts
him
in
the
ankle
he
sweeps
up
into
the
air
wildly
with
nothing
to
resist
his
stroke
he
drags
up
earth
with
the
grass
which
is
like
making
the
meadow
bleed
but
the
good
mower
who
does
things
just
as
they
should
be
done
and
have
been
for
a
hundred
thousand
years
falls
into
none
of
these
fooleries
he
goes
forward
very
steadily
his
just
barely
missing
the
ground
every
grass
falling
the
swish
and
rhythm
of
his
mowing
are
always
the
same
so
great
an
art
can
only
be
learnt
by
continual
practice
but
this
much
is
worth
writing
down
that
as
in
all
good
work
to
know
the
thing
with
which
you
work
is
the
core
of
the
affair
good
verse
is
best
written
on
good
paper
with
an
easy
pen
not
with
a
lump
of
coal
on
a
whitewashed
wall
the
pen
thinks
for
you
and
so
does
the
scythe
mow
for
you
if
you
treat
it
honourably
and
in
a
manner
that
makes
it
recognise
its
service
the
manner
is
this
you
must
regard
the
scythe
as
a
pendulum
that
swings
not
as
a
knife
that
cuts
a
good
mower
puts
no
more
strength
into
his
stroke
than
into
his
lifting
again
stand
up
to
your
work
the
bad
mower
eager
and
full
of
pain
leans
forward
and
tries
to
force
the
scythe
through
the
grass
the
good
mower
serene
and
able
stands
as
nearly
straight
as
the
shape
of
the
scythe
will
let
him
and
follows
up
every
stroke
closely
moving
his
left
foot
forward
then
also
let
every
stroke
get
well
away
mowing
is
a
thing
of
ample
gestures
like
drawing
a
cartoon
then
again
get
yourself
into
a
mechanical
and
repetitive
mood
be
thinking
of
anything
at
all
but
your
mowing
and
be
anxious
only
when
there
seems
some
interruption
to
the
monotony
of
the
sound
in
this
mowing
should
be
like
one
prayers
all
of
a
sort
and
always
the
same
and
so
made
that
you
can
establish
a
monotony
and
work
them
as
it
were
with
half
your
mind
that
happier
half
the
half
that
does
not
bother
in
this
way
when
i
had
recovered
the
art
after
so
many
years
i
went
forward
over
the
field
cutting
lane
after
lane
through
the
grass
and
bringing
out
its
most
secret
essences
with
the
sweep
of
the
scythe
until
the
air
was
full
of
odours
at
the
end
of
every
lane
i
sharpened
my
scythe
and
looked
back
at
the
work
done
and
then
carried
my
scythe
down
again
upon
my
shoulder
to
begin
another
so
long
before
the
bell
rang
in
the
chapel
above
me
that
is
long
before
six
which
is
the
time
for
the
i
had
many
swathes
already
lying
in
order
parallel
like
soldiery
and
the
high
grass
yet
standing
making
a
great
contrast
with
the
shaven
part
looked
dense
and
high
as
it
says
in
the
of
where
the
tall
son
of
the
seven
winds
came
riding
out
of
and
his
you
will
remember
trampled
into
the
press
and
made
a
gap
in
it
and
his
sword
as
you
know
was
like
a
scythe
in
arcus
when
the
grass
is
high
and
all
the
swathes
in
order
lie
and
there
the
bailiff
standing
by
of
the
tithe
so
i
mowed
all
that
morning
till
the
houses
awoke
in
the
valley
and
from
some
of
them
rose
a
little
fragrant
smoke
and
men
began
to
be
seen
i
stood
still
and
rested
on
my
scythe
to
watch
the
awakening
of
the
village
when
i
saw
coming
up
to
my
field
a
man
whom
i
had
known
in
older
times
before
i
had
left
the
valley
he
was
of
that
dark
silent
race
upon
which
all
the
learned
quarrel
but
which
by
whatever
meaningless
name
it
may
be
called
iberian
or
celtic
or
what
you
will
is
the
permanent
root
of
all
england
and
makes
england
wealthy
and
preserves
it
everywhere
except
perhaps
in
the
fens
and
in
a
part
of
yorkshire
everywhere
else
you
will
find
it
active
and
strong
these
people
are
intensive
their
thoughts
and
their
labours
turn
inward
it
is
on
account
of
their
presence
in
these
islands
that
our
gardens
are
the
richest
in
the
world
they
also
love
low
rooms
and
ample
fires
and
great
warm
slopes
of
thatch
they
have
as
i
believe
an
older
acquaintance
with
the
english
air
than
any
other
of
all
the
strains
that
make
up
england
they
hunted
in
the
weald
with
stones
and
camped
in
the
pines
of
the
they
lurked
under
the
oaks
of
the
upper
rivers
and
saw
the
legionaries
go
up
up
the
straight
paved
road
from
the
sea
they
helped
the
few
pirates
to
destroy
the
towns
and
mixed
with
those
pirates
and
shared
the
spoils
of
the
roman
villas
and
were
glad
to
see
the
captains
and
the
priests
destroyed
they
remain
and
no
admixture
of
the
frisian
pirates
or
the
breton
or
the
angevin
and
norman
conquerors
has
very
much
affected
their
cunning
eyes
to
this
race
i
say
belonged
the
man
who
now
approached
me
and
he
said
to
me
mowing
and
i
answered
ar
then
he
also
said
ar
as
in
duty
bound
for
so
we
speak
to
each
other
in
the
stenes
of
the
downs
next
he
told
me
that
as
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
would
lend
me
a
hand
and
i
thanked
him
warmly
or
as
we
say
kindly
for
it
is
a
good
custom
of
ours
always
to
treat
bargaining
as
though
it
were
a
courteous
pastime
and
though
what
he
was
after
was
money
and
what
i
wanted
was
his
labour
at
the
least
pay
yet
we
both
played
the
comedy
that
we
were
free
men
the
one
granting
a
grace
and
the
other
accepting
it
for
the
dry
bones
of
commerce
avarice
and
method
and
need
are
odious
to
the
valley
and
we
cover
them
up
with
a
pretty
body
of
fiction
and
observances
thus
when
it
comes
to
buying
pigs
the
buyer
does
not
begin
to
decry
the
pig
and
the
vendor
to
praise
it
as
is
the
custom
with
lesser
men
but
tradition
makes
them
do
business
in
this
fashion
first
the
buyer
will
go
up
to
the
seller
when
he
sees
him
in
his
own
steading
and
looking
at
the
pig
with
admiration
the
buyer
will
say
that
rain
may
or
may
not
fall
or
that
we
shall
have
snow
or
thunder
according
to
the
time
of
year
then
the
seller
looking
critically
at
the
pig
will
agree
that
the
weather
is
as
his
friend
maintains
there
is
no
haste
at
all
great
leisure
marks
the
dignity
of
their
exchange
and
the
next
step
is
that
the
buyer
says
that
a
fine
pig
you
have
there
giving
the
seller
name
ar
powerful
fine
pig
then
the
seller
saying
also
for
twin
brothers
rocked
in
one
cradle
give
each
other
ceremonious
observance
here
the
seller
i
say
admits
as
though
with
reluctance
the
strength
and
beauty
of
the
pig
and
falls
into
deep
thought
then
the
buyer
says
as
though
moved
by
a
great
desire
that
he
is
ready
to
give
so
much
for
the
pig
naming
half
the
proper
price
or
a
little
less
then
the
seller
remains
in
silence
for
some
moments
and
at
last
begins
to
shake
his
head
slowly
till
he
says
i
do
be
thinking
of
selling
the
pig
anyways
he
will
also
add
that
a
party
only
wednesday
offered
him
so
much
for
the
pig
and
he
names
about
double
the
proper
price
thus
all
ritual
is
duly
accomplished
and
the
solemn
act
is
entered
upon
with
reverence
and
in
a
spirit
of
truth
for
when
the
buyer
uses
this
phrase
i
tell
you
what
i
do
and
offers
within
half
a
crown
of
the
pig
value
the
seller
replies
that
he
can
refuse
him
nothing
and
names
half
a
crown
above
its
value
the
difference
is
split
the
pig
is
sold
and
in
the
quiet
soul
of
each
runs
the
peace
of
something
accomplished
thus
do
we
buy
a
pig
or
land
or
labour
or
malt
or
lime
always
with
elaboration
and
set
forms
and
many
a
london
man
has
paid
double
and
more
for
his
violence
and
his
greedy
haste
and
very
unchivalrous
higgling
as
happened
with
the
land
at
underwaltham
which
the
mortgagees
had
begged
and
implored
the
estate
to
take
at
twelve
hundred
and
had
privately
offered
to
all
the
world
at
a
thousand
but
which
a
sharp
direct
man
of
the
kind
that
makes
great
fortunes
a
man
in
a
a
man
in
a
fur
coat
a
man
of
few
words
bought
for
two
thousand
three
hundred
before
my
very
eyes
protesting
that
they
might
take
his
offer
or
leave
it
and
all
because
he
did
not
begin
by
praising
the
land
well
then
this
man
i
spoke
of
offered
to
help
me
and
he
went
to
get
his
scythe
but
i
went
into
the
house
and
brought
out
a
gallon
jar
of
small
ale
for
him
and
for
me
for
the
sun
was
now
very
warm
and
small
ale
goes
well
with
mowing
when
we
had
drunk
some
of
this
ale
in
mugs
called
i
see
you
we
took
each
a
swathe
he
a
little
behind
me
because
he
was
the
better
mower
and
so
for
many
hours
we
swung
one
before
the
other
mowing
and
mowing
at
the
tall
grass
of
the
field
and
the
sun
rose
to
noon
and
we
were
still
at
our
mowing
and
we
ate
food
but
only
for
a
little
while
and
we
took
again
to
our
mowing
and
at
last
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
small
square
of
grass
standing
like
a
square
of
linesmen
who
keep
their
formation
tall
and
unbroken
with
all
the
dead
lying
around
them
when
the
battle
is
over
and
done
then
for
some
little
time
i
rested
after
all
those
hours
and
the
man
and
i
talked
together
and
a
long
way
off
we
heard
in
another
field
the
musical
sharpening
of
a
scythe
the
sunlight
slanted
powdered
and
mellow
over
the
breadth
of
the
valley
for
day
was
nearing
its
end
i
went
to
fetch
rakes
from
the
steading
and
when
i
had
come
back
the
last
of
the
grass
had
fallen
and
all
the
field
lay
flat
and
smooth
with
the
very
green
short
grass
in
lanes
between
the
dead
and
yellow
swathes
these
swathes
we
raked
into
cocks
to
keep
them
from
the
dew
against
our
return
at
daybreak
and
we
made
the
cocks
as
tall
and
steep
as
we
could
for
in
that
shape
they
best
keep
off
the
dew
and
it
is
easier
also
to
spread
them
after
the
sun
has
risen
then
we
raked
up
every
straggling
blade
till
the
whole
field
was
a
clean
floor
for
the
tedding
and
the
carrying
of
the
hay
next
morning
the
grass
we
had
mown
was
but
a
little
over
two
acres
for
that
is
all
the
pasture
on
my
little
tiny
farm
when
we
had
done
all
this
there
fell
upon
us
the
beneficent
and
deliberate
evening
so
that
as
we
sat
a
little
while
together
near
the
rakes
we
saw
the
valley
more
solemn
and
dim
around
us
and
all
the
trees
and
hedgerows
quite
still
and
held
by
a
complete
silence
then
i
paid
my
companion
his
wage
and
bade
him
a
good
night
till
we
should
meet
in
the
same
place
before
sunrise
he
went
off
with
a
slow
and
steady
progress
as
all
our
peasants
do
making
their
walking
a
part
of
the
easy
but
continual
labour
of
their
lives
but
i
sat
on
watching
the
light
creep
around
towards
the
north
and
change
and
the
waning
moon
coming
up
as
though
by
stealth
behind
the
woods
of
no
man
land
the
roman
road
the
other
day
it
was
wednesday
and
the
air
was
very
pure
i
went
into
the
stable
upon
my
way
toward
the
wood
and
there
i
saw
my
horse
monster
standing
by
himself
regarding
nothingness
and
when
i
had
considered
what
a
shame
it
was
to
take
one
pleasure
in
a
wood
and
leave
helpless
horse
at
home
i
bridled
him
and
saddled
him
and
took
him
out
and
rode
him
the
way
that
i
had
meant
to
go
alone
so
we
went
together
along
the
stene
under
the
north
wood
until
we
got
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
then
we
took
the
green
ride
to
the
right
for
it
was
my
intention
to
go
and
look
at
the
roman
road
behind
my
house
behind
my
little
farm
there
are
as
many
miles
of
turf
as
one
cares
to
count
and
then
behind
it
also
but
the
other
way
there
goes
this
deep
and
lonely
forest
it
is
principally
of
beech
which
is
the
tree
of
the
chalk
and
no
one
has
cut
it
or
fenced
it
or
thought
about
it
except
to
love
it
since
the
parts
about
my
village
took
their
names
gumber
and
fairmile
bay
combe
the
nore
and
the
stretch
called
no
man
land
into
the
darkness
of
these
trees
i
rode
very
quietly
with
monster
my
horse
but
whether
the
autumn
air
were
pleasanter
to
him
or
to
me
neither
of
us
could
decide
for
there
is
no
bridge
between
two
souls
that
is
if
horses
have
a
soul
which
i
suppose
they
have
for
they
are
both
stupid
and
kindly
and
they
fear
death
as
though
a
part
and
but
a
part
of
them
were
immortal
also
they
see
things
in
the
dark
and
are
cognisant
of
evil
when
i
had
gone
some
hundred
yards
towards
the
roman
road
i
saw
bending
lower
than
the
rest
on
the
tree
from
which
it
hung
a
golden
bough
and
i
said
to
myself
that
i
had
had
good
luck
for
such
a
thing
has
always
been
the
sign
of
an
unusual
experience
and
of
a
voyage
among
the
dead
all
the
other
leaves
of
the
tree
were
green
but
the
turn
of
the
year
which
sends
out
foragers
just
as
the
spring
does
marking
the
way
it
is
to
go
had
come
and
touched
this
bough
and
changed
it
so
that
it
shone
out
by
itself
in
the
recesses
of
the
forest
and
gleamed
before
and
behind
i
did
not
ask
what
way
it
led
me
for
i
knew
and
so
i
went
onwards
riding
my
horse
until
i
came
to
that
long
bank
of
earth
which
runs
like
a
sort
of
challenge
through
this
ancient
land
to
prove
what
our
origins
were
and
who
first
brought
us
merry
people
into
the
circuit
of
the
world
when
i
saw
the
roman
road
the
sharper
influence
which
it
had
had
upon
my
boyhood
returned
to
me
and
i
got
off
my
horse
and
took
his
bit
out
of
his
mouth
so
that
he
could
play
the
fool
with
the
grass
and
leaves
which
are
bad
for
him
and
i
hitched
the
snaffle
to
a
little
broken
peg
of
bough
so
that
he
could
not
wander
and
then
i
looked
up
and
down
along
the
boles
of
the
great
north
wood
taking
in
the
straight
line
of
the
way
i
have
heard
it
said
that
certain
professors
the
most
learned
of
their
day
did
once
deny
that
this
was
a
roman
road
i
can
well
believe
it
and
it
is
delightful
to
believe
that
they
did
for
this
road
startles
and
controls
a
true
man
presenting
an
eternal
example
of
what
rome
could
do
the
peasants
around
have
always
called
it
the
street
it
leads
from
what
was
certainly
one
roman
town
to
what
was
certainly
another
that
sign
of
roman
occupation
the
modern
word
cold
harbour
is
scattered
up
and
down
it
there
are
roman
pavements
on
it
it
goes
plumb
straight
for
miles
and
at
times
wherever
it
crosses
undisturbed
land
it
is
three
or
four
feet
above
the
level
of
the
down
here
then
was
a
feast
for
the
learned
since
certainly
the
more
obvious
a
thing
is
the
more
glory
there
must
be
in
denying
it
and
deny
it
they
did
or
at
least
so
i
am
told
just
as
they
will
deny
that
thomas
à
becket
was
a
papist
or
that
austerlitz
was
fought
in
spite
of
trafalgar
or
that
the
gospel
of
john
is
the
gospel
of
john
here
then
sitting
upon
this
roman
road
i
considered
the
nature
of
such
men
and
when
i
had
thought
out
carefully
where
the
nearest
don
might
be
at
that
moment
i
decided
that
he
was
at
least
miles
away
and
i
was
very
glad
for
it
permitted
me
to
contemplate
the
road
with
common
sense
and
with
faith
which
is
common
sense
transfigured
and
i
could
see
the
legionaries
climbing
the
hill
i
remembered
also
what
a
sight
there
was
upon
the
down
above
and
i
got
upon
my
horse
again
to
go
and
see
it
when
one
has
pushed
one
way
through
the
brambles
and
the
rounded
great
roots
which
have
grown
upon
this
street
where
no
man
has
walked
perhaps
for
about
a
thousand
years
one
gets
to
the
place
where
it
tops
the
hill
and
here
one
sees
the
way
in
which
the
line
of
it
was
first
struck
out
from
where
one
stands
right
away
like
a
beam
leading
from
rise
to
rise
it
runs
to
the
cathedral
town
you
see
the
spot
where
it
enters
the
eastern
gate
of
the
roman
walls
you
see
at
the
end
of
it
like
the
dot
upon
an
i
the
mass
of
the
cathedral
then
if
you
turn
and
look
northward
you
see
from
point
to
point
its
taut
stretch
across
the
weald
to
where
at
the
very
limit
of
the
horizon
there
is
a
gap
in
the
chain
of
hills
that
bars
your
view
the
strict
design
of
such
a
thing
weighs
upon
one
as
might
weigh
upon
one
four
great
lines
of
virgil
or
the
sight
of
those
enormous
stones
which
one
comes
upon
roman
also
in
the
algerian
sands
the
plan
of
such
an
avenue
by
which
to
lead
great
armies
and
along
which
to
drive
commands
argues
a
mixture
of
unity
and
of
power
as
intimate
as
the
lime
and
the
sand
of
which
these
conquerors
welded
their
imperishable
cement
and
it
does
more
than
this
it
suggests
swiftness
and
certitude
of
aim
and
a
sort
of
eager
determination
which
we
are
slow
to
connect
with
government
but
which
certainly
underlay
the
triumph
of
this
people
a
road
will
give
one
less
trouble
if
it
winds
about
and
feels
the
contours
of
the
land
it
will
pay
better
if
it
is
of
earth
and
broken
stones
instead
of
being
paved
nor
would
any
one
aiming
at
wealth
or
comfort
alone
laboriously
raise
its
level
as
the
level
of
this
road
is
raised
but
in
all
that
the
romans
did
there
was
something
of
a
monument
where
they
might
have
taken
pipes
down
a
valley
and
up
the
opposing
side
they
preferred
the
broad
shoulders
of
an
arcade
and
where
a
door
would
have
done
well
enough
to
enter
their
houses
by
they
were
content
with
nothing
less
than
an
arch
of
fifty
in
all
their
work
they
were
conscious
of
some
business
other
than
that
immediately
to
hand
and
therefore
it
is
possible
that
their
ruins
will
survive
the
establishment
of
our
own
time
as
they
have
survived
that
of
the
middle
ages
in
this
wild
place
at
least
nothing
remained
of
all
that
was
done
between
their
time
and
ours
these
things
did
the
sight
on
either
side
of
the
summit
suggest
to
me
but
chiefly
there
returned
as
i
gazed
the
delicious
thought
that
learned
men
laborious
and
heavily
endowed
had
denied
the
of
this
roman
road
see
with
what
manifold
uses
every
accident
of
human
life
is
crammed
here
was
a
piece
of
pedantry
and
scepticism
which
might
make
some
men
weep
and
some
men
stamp
with
irritation
and
some
men
from
sheer
boredom
fall
asleep
but
which
fed
in
my
own
spirit
a
fountain
of
pure
joy
as
i
considered
carefully
what
kind
of
man
it
is
who
denies
these
things
the
kind
of
way
he
walks
the
kind
of
face
he
has
the
kind
of
book
he
writes
the
kind
of
publisher
who
chisels
him
and
the
kind
of
way
in
which
his
works
are
bound
with
every
moment
my
elation
grew
greater
and
more
impetuous
until
at
last
i
could
not
bear
to
sit
any
longer
still
even
upon
so
admirable
a
beast
nor
to
look
down
even
at
so
rich
a
plain
though
that
was
seen
through
the
air
of
southern
england
but
turning
over
the
downs
i
galloped
home
and
came
in
straight
from
the
turf
to
my
own
ground
for
what
man
would
live
upon
a
high
road
who
could
go
through
a
gate
right
off
the
turf
to
his
own
steading
and
let
the
world
go
hang
and
so
did
i
but
as
they
brought
me
beer
and
bacon
at
evening
and
i
toasted
the
memory
of
things
past
i
said
to
myself
oxford
cambridge
dublin
durham
you
four
great
universities
you
terrors
of
europe
that
road
is
older
than
you
and
meanwhile
i
drink
to
your
continued
healths
but
let
us
have
a
little
room
air
there
give
us
air
good
people
i
stifle
when
i
think
of
you
the
there
is
a
hill
not
far
from
my
home
whence
it
is
possible
to
see
northward
and
southward
such
a
stretch
of
land
as
is
not
to
be
seen
from
any
eminence
among
those
i
know
in
western
europe
southward
the
and
the
sea
standing
up
in
a
belt
of
light
against
the
sky
and
northward
all
the
weald
from
this
summit
the
eye
is
disturbed
by
no
great
cities
of
the
modern
sort
but
a
dozen
at
least
of
those
small
market
towns
which
are
the
delight
of
south
england
hold
the
view
from
point
to
point
from
the
pale
blue
downs
of
the
island
over
eastward
to
the
kentish
hills
a
very
long
way
off
and
near
the
the
high
faint
spire
of
that
cathedral
which
was
once
the
mother
of
all
my
county
goes
up
without
weight
into
the
air
and
gathers
round
it
the
delicate
and
distant
outlines
of
the
landscape
as
indeed
its
builders
meant
that
it
should
do
in
such
a
spot
on
such
a
high
of
england
i
met
three
days
ago
a
man
i
had
been
riding
my
kind
and
honourable
horse
for
two
hours
broken
indeed
by
a
long
rest
in
a
deserted
barn
i
had
been
his
companion
i
say
for
two
hours
and
had
told
him
a
hundred
interesting
things
to
which
he
had
answered
nothing
at
all
when
i
took
him
along
a
path
that
neither
of
us
yet
had
trod
i
had
not
i
know
he
had
not
i
think
for
he
went
snorting
and
doubtfully
this
path
broke
up
from
the
kennels
near
waltham
and
made
for
the
high
wood
between
gumber
and
no
man
land
it
went
over
dead
leaves
and
quite
lonely
to
the
thick
of
the
forest
there
it
died
out
into
a
vaguer
and
a
vaguer
trail
at
last
it
ceased
altogether
and
for
half
an
hour
or
so
i
pushed
carefully
always
climbing
upwards
through
the
branches
and
picked
my
way
along
the
until
at
last
i
came
out
upon
that
open
space
of
which
i
had
spoken
and
which
i
have
known
since
my
childhood
as
i
came
out
of
the
wood
the
wind
met
me
full
of
the
atlantic
and
it
seemed
to
me
to
blow
from
paradise
i
remembered
as
i
halted
and
so
gazed
north
and
south
to
the
weald
below
me
and
then
again
to
the
sea
the
story
of
that
sultan
who
publicly
proclaimed
that
he
had
possessed
all
power
on
earth
and
had
numbered
on
a
tablet
with
his
own
hand
each
of
his
happy
days
and
had
found
them
when
he
came
to
die
to
be
seventeen
i
knew
what
that
heathen
had
meant
and
i
looked
into
my
heart
as
i
remembered
the
story
but
i
came
back
from
the
examination
satisfied
for
so
far
i
said
to
myself
this
day
is
among
my
number
and
the
light
is
falling
i
will
count
it
for
one
it
was
then
that
i
saw
before
me
going
easily
and
slowly
across
the
downs
the
figure
of
a
man
he
was
powerful
full
of
health
and
easy
his
clothes
were
rags
his
face
was
open
and
bronzed
i
came
at
once
off
my
horse
to
speak
with
him
and
holding
my
horse
by
the
bridle
i
led
it
forward
till
we
met
then
i
asked
him
whither
he
was
going
and
whether
as
i
knew
these
open
hills
by
heart
i
could
not
help
him
on
his
way
he
answered
me
that
he
was
in
no
need
of
help
for
he
was
bound
nowhere
but
that
he
had
come
up
off
the
high
road
on
to
the
hills
in
order
to
get
his
pleasure
and
also
to
see
what
there
was
on
the
other
side
he
said
to
me
also
with
evident
enjoyment
and
in
the
accent
of
a
lettered
man
this
is
indeed
a
day
to
be
alive
i
saw
that
i
had
here
some
chance
of
an
adventure
since
it
is
not
every
day
that
one
meets
upon
a
lonely
down
a
man
of
culture
in
rags
and
happy
i
therefore
took
the
bridle
right
off
my
horse
and
let
him
nibble
and
i
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
the
roman
road
holding
the
leather
of
the
bridle
in
my
hand
and
wiping
the
bit
with
plucked
grass
the
stranger
sat
down
beside
me
and
drew
from
his
pocket
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
large
onion
we
then
talked
of
those
things
which
should
chiefly
occupy
mankind
i
mean
of
happiness
and
of
the
destiny
of
the
soul
upon
these
matters
i
found
him
to
be
exact
thoughtful
and
just
first
then
i
said
to
him
i
also
have
been
full
of
gladness
all
this
day
and
what
is
more
as
i
came
up
the
hill
from
waltham
i
was
inspired
to
verse
and
wrote
it
inside
my
mind
completing
a
passage
i
had
been
working
at
for
two
years
upon
joy
but
it
was
easy
for
me
to
be
happy
since
i
was
on
a
horse
and
warm
and
well
fed
yet
even
for
me
such
days
are
capricious
i
have
known
but
few
in
my
life
they
are
each
of
them
distinct
and
clear
so
rare
are
they
and
what
is
more
so
different
are
they
in
their
very
quality
from
all
other
days
you
are
right
he
said
in
this
last
phrase
of
yours
they
are
indeed
quite
other
from
all
the
common
days
of
our
lives
but
you
were
wrong
i
think
in
saying
that
your
horse
and
clothes
and
good
feeding
and
the
rest
had
to
do
with
these
curious
intervals
of
content
wealth
makes
the
run
of
our
days
somewhat
more
easy
poverty
makes
them
more
hard
or
very
hard
but
no
poverty
has
ever
yet
brought
of
itself
despair
into
the
soul
the
men
who
kill
themselves
are
neither
rich
nor
poor
still
less
has
wealth
ever
purchased
those
peculiar
hours
i
also
am
filled
with
their
spirit
and
god
knows
said
he
cutting
his
onion
in
two
so
that
it
gave
out
a
strong
savour
god
knows
i
can
purchase
nothing
then
tell
me
i
said
whence
do
you
believe
these
moments
come
and
will
you
give
me
half
your
onion
with
pleasure
he
replied
for
no
man
can
eat
a
whole
onion
and
as
for
that
other
matter
why
i
think
the
door
of
heaven
is
ajar
from
time
to
time
and
that
light
shines
out
upon
us
for
a
moment
between
its
opening
and
closing
he
said
this
in
a
merry
sober
manner
his
black
eyes
sparkled
and
his
large
beard
was
blown
about
a
little
by
the
wind
then
he
added
if
a
man
is
a
slave
to
the
rich
in
the
great
cities
the
most
miserable
of
mankind
yet
these
days
come
to
him
to
the
vicious
wealthy
and
privileged
men
whose
faces
are
stamped
hard
with
degradation
these
days
come
they
come
to
you
you
say
working
i
suppose
in
anxiety
like
most
of
men
they
come
to
me
who
neither
work
nor
am
anxious
so
long
as
south
england
may
freely
import
onions
i
believe
you
are
right
i
said
and
i
especially
commend
you
for
eating
onions
they
contain
all
health
they
induce
sleep
they
may
be
called
the
apples
of
content
or
again
the
companion
fruits
of
mankind
i
have
always
said
he
answered
gravely
that
when
the
couple
of
them
left
eden
they
hid
and
took
away
with
them
an
onion
i
am
moved
in
my
soul
to
have
known
a
man
who
reveres
and
loves
them
in
the
due
measure
for
such
men
are
rare
then
he
asked
with
evident
anxiety
is
there
no
inn
about
here
where
a
man
like
me
will
be
taken
in
yes
i
told
him
down
under
the
combe
at
duncton
is
a
very
good
inn
have
you
money
to
pay
will
you
take
some
of
my
money
i
will
take
all
you
can
possibly
afford
me
he
answered
in
a
cheerful
manly
fashion
i
counted
out
my
money
and
found
i
had
on
me
but
here
is
i
said
thank
you
indeed
he
answered
taking
the
coins
and
wrapping
them
in
a
little
rag
for
he
had
no
pockets
but
only
holes
i
wish
i
said
with
regret
we
might
meet
and
talk
more
often
of
many
things
so
much
do
we
agree
and
men
like
you
and
me
are
often
lonely
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
put
his
head
on
one
side
quizzing
at
me
with
his
eyes
then
he
shook
his
head
decidedly
and
said
no
no
it
is
certain
that
we
shall
never
meet
again
and
thanking
me
with
great
fervour
but
briefly
he
went
largely
and
strongly
down
the
escarpment
of
the
combe
to
duncton
and
the
weald
and
i
shall
never
see
him
again
till
the
great
day
the
return
to
england
in
calais
harbour
it
being
still
very
early
in
the
morning
about
five
i
peered
out
to
see
how
things
were
looking
for
if
that
coast
corresponded
at
all
to
ours
the
tide
should
be
making
westerly
by
six
that
day
the
ebb
tide
and
it
was
on
the
first
of
that
tide
that
i
should
make
the
passage
to
england
for
at
sea
you
never
can
tell
at
sea
you
never
can
tell
and
you
must
take
every
inch
the
gods
allow
you
you
will
need
that
and
more
very
often
before
evening
now
as
i
put
my
head
out
i
saw
that
i
could
not
yet
start
for
there
was
a
thick
white
mist
over
everything
so
that
i
could
not
even
see
the
bowsprit
of
my
own
boat
everything
was
damp
the
decks
smelt
of
fog
and
from
the
shore
came
sounds
whose
cause
i
could
not
see
looking
over
the
iron
bulwarks
of
the
big
english
cargo
ship
alongside
of
which
i
was
moored
was
a
man
with
his
head
upon
his
folded
arms
he
told
me
that
he
thought
the
fog
would
lift
and
so
i
waited
seeking
no
more
sleep
but
sitting
up
there
in
the
drifting
fog
and
taking
pleasure
in
a
bugle
call
which
the
french
call
la
diane
and
which
they
play
to
wake
the
soldiers
but
in
summer
it
wakes
nobody
for
all
the
world
is
waking
long
before
towards
six
the
mist
blew
clean
away
before
a
little
air
from
the
it
had
come
sharp
over
those
miles
and
miles
of
sand
dunes
and
flats
which
stretched
away
from
on
to
denmark
from
all
the
way
to
the
sound
there
is
no
other
hill
but
coarse
grass
and
flying
sand
finding
this
wind
i
very
quickly
set
sail
and
as
i
did
not
know
the
harbour
i
let
down
the
peak
of
the
mainsail
that
she
might
sail
slowly
and
crept
along
close
to
the
eastern
pier
for
fear
that
when
i
got
to
the
open
work
the
westerly
tide
should
drive
me
against
the
western
pier
but
there
was
no
need
for
all
this
caution
since
the
tide
was
not
yet
making
strongly
yet
was
i
wise
to
beware
for
if
you
give
the
strange
gods
of
the
sea
one
little
chance
they
will
take
a
hundred
and
drown
you
for
their
pleasure
and
sailing
if
you
sail
in
all
weathers
is
a
perpetual
game
of
skill
against
them
the
heartiest
and
most
hazardous
game
in
the
world
so
then
when
i
had
got
well
outside
i
found
what
is
called
a
lump
the
sea
was
jumbling
up
and
down
irregularly
as
though
great
animals
had
just
stopped
fighting
there
but
whatever
was
the
cause
of
it
this
lump
made
it
difficult
to
manage
the
boat
i
was
in
for
the
air
was
still
light
and
somewhat
unsteady
sometimes
within
a
point
of
north
and
then
again
dropping
and
rising
free
within
a
point
of
east
on
the
whole
to
windward
the
sea
was
very
clear
but
down
towards
the
land
there
was
a
haze
and
when
i
got
to
the
black
buoy
which
is
three
miles
from
calais
and
marks
the
place
where
you
should
turn
to
go
into
the
harbour
i
could
barely
see
the
high
land
glooming
through
the
weather
and
calais
belfry
and
lighthouse
tower
i
could
not
see
at
all
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
saw
it
was
seven
and
immediately
afterwards
the
wind
became
steady
and
true
and
somewhat
stronger
and
work
began
she
would
point
very
nearly
north
and
so
i
laid
her
for
that
course
though
that
would
have
taken
me
right
outside
the
goodwins
for
i
knew
that
the
tide
was
making
westerly
down
the
channel
ebbing
away
faster
and
faster
and
that
like
a
man
crossing
a
rapid
river
in
a
i
had
to
point
up
far
above
where
i
wanted
to
land
which
was
at
dover
the
nearest
harbour
i
sailed
her
therefore
i
say
as
close
as
she
would
lie
and
the
wind
rose
the
wind
rose
and
for
half
an
hour
i
kept
her
to
it
she
had
no
more
sail
than
she
needed
she
heeled
beautifully
and
strongly
to
the
wind
she
took
the
seas
as
they
ran
more
regular
with
a
motion
of
mastery
it
was
like
the
gesture
of
a
horse
when
he
bends
his
head
back
to
his
chest
arching
his
neck
with
pride
as
he
springs
upon
our
downs
at
morning
so
set
had
the
surging
of
the
sea
become
that
she
rose
and
fell
to
it
with
rhythm
and
the
helm
could
be
kept
quite
steady
and
the
regular
splash
of
the
rising
bows
and
the
little
wisps
of
foam
came
in
ceaseless
exactitude
like
the
marching
of
men
and
in
all
this
one
mixed
with
the
life
of
the
sea
but
before
it
was
eight
and
i
had
eaten
nothing
the
wind
got
stronger
still
and
i
was
anxious
and
gazed
continuously
into
it
up
to
windward
seeing
the
white
caps
beginning
on
the
tops
of
the
seas
although
the
wind
and
tide
were
together
she
heeled
also
much
more
and
my
anxiety
hardened
with
the
wind
for
the
wind
had
strengthened
by
about
eight
so
that
it
was
very
strong
indeed
and
she
was
plainly
her
lee
rail
under
all
the
time
and
all
the
cordage
humming
there
it
stood
and
by
the
grace
and
mercy
of
god
the
wind
increased
no
more
for
its
caprice
might
have
been
very
different
then
began
that
excellent
game
which
it
is
so
hard
to
play
but
so
good
to
remember
and
in
which
all
men
whether
they
admit
it
or
not
are
full
of
fear
but
it
is
a
fear
so
steeped
in
exhilaration
that
one
would
think
the
personal
spirit
of
the
sea
was
mingled
with
the
noise
of
the
air
for
a
whole
great
hour
she
roared
and
lifted
through
it
still
taking
the
larger
seas
grandly
with
disdain
as
she
had
taken
the
smaller
and
still
over
the
buried
lee
rail
the
stream
of
the
sea
went
by
rejoicing
and
pouring
and
the
sheets
and
the
weather
runner
trembled
with
the
vigour
of
the
charge
and
on
she
went
and
on
i
was
weary
of
the
seas
ahead
for
each
and
individually
they
struck
my
soul
as
they
came
even
more
strongly
than
they
struck
the
bows
steep
curling
unintermittent
rank
upon
rank
upon
rank
as
innumerable
cavalry
still
watching
them
i
say
i
groped
round
with
my
hand
behind
the
cabin
door
and
pulled
out
brandy
and
bread
and
drank
brandy
and
ate
bread
still
watching
the
seas
and
as
men
are
proud
of
their
companions
in
danger
so
i
was
proud
to
see
the
admirable
lift
and
swing
of
that
good
boat
and
to
note
how
if
she
slowed
for
a
moment
under
the
pounding
she
recovered
with
a
stride
rejoicing
and
as
for
my
fears
which
were
now
fixed
and
considerable
i
found
this
argument
against
them
that
though
i
could
see
nothing
round
me
but
the
sea
yet
soon
i
should
be
under
the
lee
of
the
goodwins
for
though
i
could
not
exactly
calculate
my
speed
and
though
in
the
haze
beyond
nothing
appeared
it
was
certain
that
i
was
roaring
very
quickly
towards
the
further
shore
when
later
the
sea
grew
confused
and
full
of
swirls
and
boiling
i
said
to
myself
this
must
be
the
tail
of
the
goodwins
but
it
was
not
for
though
i
did
not
know
it
the
ebb
of
the
great
spring
tide
had
carried
me
right
away
down
channel
and
there
was
not
twelve
feet
of
water
under
the
keel
for
the
seething
of
the
sea
that
i
noticed
came
from
the
varne
the
varne
that
curious
long
steep
hill
with
its
twin
ridge
close
by
the
colbert
they
stand
right
up
in
the
channel
between
france
and
england
they
very
nearly
lift
their
heads
above
the
waves
i
passed
over
the
crest
of
them
unknowing
into
the
deep
beyond
and
still
the
ship
raced
on
then
somewhat
suddenly
so
suddenly
that
i
gave
a
cry
i
saw
right
up
above
me
through
what
was
now
a
thick
haze
the
cliffs
of
england
perhaps
two
miles
away
and
showing
very
faintly
indeed
a
bare
outline
upon
the
white
weather
a
thought
ran
into
my
mind
with
violence
how
one
behind
the
other
beyond
known
things
beyond
history
the
men
from
whom
i
came
had
greeted
this
sight
after
winds
like
these
and
danger
and
the
crossing
of
the
narrow
seas
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
ten
so
that
this
crossing
had
taken
three
hours
and
to
see
the
land
again
like
that
was
better
than
any
harbour
and
i
knew
that
all
those
hours
my
mind
had
been
at
strain
i
looked
again
at
the
vague
cliffs
narrowly
thinking
them
the
south
foreland
but
as
they
cleared
i
saw
to
my
astonishment
that
i
had
blown
all
down
the
straits
and
that
folkestone
and
the
last
walls
of
the
chalk
were
before
me
the
wind
dropped
the
sea
went
on
uneasily
tumbling
and
rolling
but
within
a
very
little
while
before
eleven
i
think
there
was
no
breeze
at
all
and
there
i
lay
with
folkestone
harbour
not
a
mile
away
but
never
any
chance
of
getting
there
and
i
whistled
but
no
wind
came
i
sat
idle
and
admired
the
loneliness
of
the
sea
till
towards
one
a
little
draught
of
air
blew
slantwise
from
the
land
and
under
it
i
crept
to
the
smooth
water
within
the
stone
arm
of
the
breakwater
and
here
i
let
the
anchor
go
and
settling
everything
i
slept
it
is
pleasant
to
remember
these
things
the
valley
of
the
rother
there
is
in
that
part
of
england
which
is
very
properly
called
her
eden
that
centre
of
all
good
things
and
home
of
happy
men
the
county
of
sussex
there
is
i
say
in
that
exalted
county
a
valley
which
i
shall
praise
for
your
greater
pleasure
because
i
know
that
it
is
too
jealously
guarded
for
any
run
of
strangers
to
make
it
common
and
because
i
am
very
sure
that
you
may
go
and
only
make
it
the
more
delightful
by
your
presence
it
is
the
valley
of
the
river
rother
the
sacred
and
fruitful
river
between
the
downs
and
the
weald
now
here
many
travelling
men
bicyclists
even
and
some
who
visit
for
a
livelihood
will
think
i
mean
the
famous
river
rother
that
almost
reaches
the
sea
the
rother
into
which
the
foreigners
sailed
for
so
many
hundred
years
the
river
of
the
marshes
the
river
on
which
stands
rye
the
easy
rother
along
whose
deep
meadows
are
the
sloping
kilns
the
towns
and
the
steep
roads
the
red
rother
that
is
fed
by
streams
from
the
ironstone
this
rother
also
all
good
men
know
and
love
both
those
that
come
in
for
pleasure
strangers
of
kent
and
those
that
have
a
distant
birthright
in
east
sussex
being
born
beyond
ouse
in
the
rape
of
bramber
but
it
is
not
this
rother
that
i
am
telling
of
though
i
would
love
to
tell
of
it
also
as
indeed
i
would
love
to
tell
at
length
of
all
the
rivers
of
sussex
the
brede
the
ouse
the
adur
the
cuckmere
all
the
streams
that
cut
the
chalk
hills
but
for
this
i
have
no
space
and
you
no
patience
neither
can
i
tell
you
of
a
thousand
adventures
and
wonderful
hazards
along
the
hills
and
valley
of
this
eastern
rother
of
how
i
once
through
a
telescope
on
brightling
hill
saw
the
meet
at
battle
and
of
how
it
looked
quite
near
of
how
i
leapt
the
river
rother
once
landing
on
the
far
side
safely
which
argues
the
river
narrow
or
the
leap
tremendous
of
how
i
poached
in
the
wood
of
a
friend
who
is
still
my
friend
of
how
i
rode
a
horse
into
robertsbridge
of
the
inn
all
these
things
could
i
tell
with
growing
fervour
and
to
all
these
would
you
listen
with
an
increasing
delight
but
i
must
write
of
the
river
rother
under
petworth
the
other
rother
in
the
west
why
because
i
started
out
so
to
do
and
no
man
should
let
himself
be
led
away
by
a
word
or
by
any
such
little
thing
let
me
therefore
have
done
with
this
eastern
river
far
away
from
my
home
a
river
at
the
end
of
long
journeys
and
speak
of
that
other
noble
rother
the
rother
of
quiet
men
the
valley
that
is
like
a
shrine
in
england
many
famous
towns
and
villages
stand
in
the
valley
of
this
river
and
even
some
of
them
upon
its
very
banks
thus
there
are
the
three
principal
towns
of
this
part
midhurst
and
petworth
and
pulborough
but
these
have
been
dealt
with
and
written
of
in
so
many
great
books
and
by
such
a
swarm
of
new
men
that
i
have
no
business
further
to
describe
their
merits
and
antiquity
but
this
i
will
add
to
all
that
is
known
of
them
midhurst
takes
its
name
from
standing
in
the
middle
for
it
is
between
the
open
downs
and
the
thick
woods
on
the
borders
of
surrey
petworth
has
a
steeple
that
slopes
to
one
side
not
so
much
as
chesterfield
but
somewhat
more
than
most
steeples
pulborough
stands
upon
a
hill
and
is
famous
for
its
to
which
people
come
from
far
and
near
from
as
far
off
as
burpham
or
as
close
by
as
bury
all
these
noble
towns
have
as
i
said
before
been
written
of
in
books
only
no
book
that
i
know
puts
them
all
together
and
calls
them
the
valley
of
the
rother
that
is
the
title
that
such
a
book
should
have
if
it
is
to
treat
of
the
heart
of
west
sussex
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
such
a
book
would
be
read
lovingly
by
many
men
for
the
valley
of
the
rother
breeds
men
and
is
the
cause
of
many
delightful
villages
all
the
homes
of
men
i
know
that
cobden
was
born
there
the
last
of
the
yeomen
i
hope
that
cobbett
lived
here
too
manning
was
here
in
his
short
married
life
he
lived
at
barlton
which
foolish
men
call
barlavington
under
the
old
downs
where
the
steep
woods
make
a
hollow
in
this
valley
also
are
fittleworth
the
only
place
in
england
that
rhymes
with
little
worth
duncton
about
which
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
burton
which
is
very
old
and
has
its
church
right
in
the
grounds
of
the
house
westburton
where
the
racehorses
were
graffham
bignor
sutton
and
i
know
not
how
many
delightful
hamlets
in
the
valley
of
the
river
rother
no
hurried
men
ever
come
for
it
leads
nowhere
they
cross
it
now
and
then
and
they
forget
it
but
who
unless
he
be
a
son
or
a
lover
has
really
known
that
plain
it
leads
nowhere
to
the
no
man
land
the
broken
country
by
liss
it
has
in
it
no
curious
sight
but
only
beauty
the
rich
men
in
it
and
thank
heaven
they
are
few
are
of
a
reticent
and
homing
kind
or
when
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
they
have
estates
elsewhere
and
go
north
for
their
pleasure
foxes
are
hunted
in
the
valley
of
the
rother
but
there
are
not
very
many
pheasants
and
partridges
are
shot
but
i
never
heard
of
great
bags
one
animal
indeed
there
is
in
profusion
the
rabbit
swarms
and
exults
in
this
life
of
southern
england
do
you
stalk
him
he
sits
and
watches
you
do
you
hunt
him
with
dogs
he
thinks
it
a
vast
bother
about
a
very
little
matter
do
you
ferret
him
he
dies
and
rejoices
to
know
that
so
many
more
will
take
his
place
the
rabbit
is
the
sacred
emblem
of
my
river
and
when
we
have
a
symbol
he
shall
be
our
symbol
he
loves
men
and
eats
the
things
they
plant
especially
the
tender
shoots
of
young
trees
wheat
and
the
choice
roots
in
gardens
he
only
remains
and
is
happy
all
his
little
life
in
the
valley
from
which
we
depart
when
our
boyhood
ends
the
valley
of
the
rother
is
made
of
many
parts
there
is
the
chalk
of
the
southern
the
belt
of
the
loam
beneath
it
then
the
curious
country
of
sand
full
of
dells
and
dark
with
pine
woods
then
the
luxurious
meadows
which
are
open
and
full
of
cattle
colts
and
even
sheep
then
the
woods
it
is
in
a
few
miles
a
little
england
there
are
also
large
heaths
larger
you
would
think
than
such
a
corner
of
the
earth
could
contain
old
elms
and
oaks
many
wide
parks
fish
ponds
one
trout
stream
and
half
a
score
of
mills
there
are
men
of
many
characters
but
all
happy
honest
good
witty
and
hale
and
when
i
have
said
all
i
could
say
of
this
delightful
place
which
indeed
i
think
is
set
apart
for
the
reward
of
virtue
i
should
not
have
given
you
a
tithe
of
its
prosperity
and
peace
and
beneficence
there
is
the
picture
of
the
valley
of
the
river
rother
it
flows
in
a
short
and
happy
murmur
from
the
confined
hills
by
hindhead
to
the
arun
itself
but
of
the
arun
no
one
could
write
with
any
justice
except
at
the
expense
of
far
more
space
and
time
than
i
have
given
me
if
ever
again
we
have
a
religion
in
the
south
country
we
will
have
a
temple
to
my
darling
valley
it
shall
be
round
with
columns
and
a
wall
and
there
i
will
hang
a
wreath
in
thanksgiving
for
having
known
the
river
the
coronation
my
companion
said
to
me
that
there
was
a
doom
over
the
day
and
the
reign
and
the
times
and
that
the
turn
of
the
nation
had
come
he
felt
it
in
the
sky
the
day
had
been
troubled
from
the
forest
ridge
to
the
sea
there
was
neither
wind
nor
sun
but
a
dull
even
heat
oppressed
the
fields
and
the
high
downs
under
the
uncertain
confusion
of
grey
clouds
it
was
as
though
a
relief
was
being
denied
and
as
though
something
inexorable
had
come
into
that
air
which
is
normally
the
softest
and
most
tender
in
the
world
the
hours
of
the
low
tide
were
too
silent
the
little
inland
river
was
quite
dead
the
reeds
beside
it
dry
and
motionless
even
in
the
trees
about
it
no
leaves
stirred
in
the
late
afternoon
as
the
heat
grew
more
masterful
a
slight
wind
came
out
of
the
east
it
was
so
faint
and
doubtful
in
quantity
that
one
could
not
be
certain
as
one
stood
on
the
deserted
shore
whether
it
blew
from
just
off
the
land
or
from
the
sullen
level
of
the
sea
it
followed
along
the
line
of
the
coast
without
refreshment
and
without
vigour
even
hotter
than
had
been
the
still
air
out
of
which
it
was
engendered
it
did
not
do
more
than
ruffle
here
and
there
the
uneasy
surface
of
our
sea
that
surface
moved
a
little
but
with
a
motion
borrowed
from
nothing
so
living
or
so
natural
as
the
wind
it
was
a
dull
memory
of
past
storms
or
perhaps
that
mysterious
heaving
from
the
lower
sands
which
sailors
know
but
which
no
silence
has
yet
explained
in
such
an
influence
of
expectation
and
of
presage
an
influence
having
in
it
that
quality
which
seemed
to
the
ancients
only
fate
but
to
us
moderns
a
something
evil
in
the
strained
attention
for
necessary
and
immovable
things
that
can
not
hear
and
can
not
pity
the
hour
came
for
me
to
reascend
the
valley
to
my
home
already
upon
the
far
and
confused
horizon
two
or
three
motionless
sails
that
had
been
invisible
began
to
show
white
against
a
rising
cloud
this
cloud
had
not
the
definition
of
sudden
conquering
storms
proper
to
the
summer
and
leaving
a
blessing
behind
their
fury
the
edge
of
it
against
the
misty
and
brooding
sky
had
all
the
vagueness
of
smoke
and
as
it
rose
up
out
of
the
sea
its
growth
was
so
methodical
and
regular
as
to
disconnect
it
wholly
in
one
mind
from
the
little
fainting
breeze
that
still
blew
from
rain
or
from
any
daily
thing
it
advanced
with
the
fall
of
the
evening
till
it
held
half
the
sky
there
it
seemed
halted
for
a
while
and
lent
by
contrast
an
unnatural
brightness
to
the
parched
hills
beneath
it
for
now
the
sun
having
set
we
had
come
north
of
the
gap
and
were
looking
southward
upon
that
spectacle
as
upon
the
climax
of
a
tragedy
but
there
was
nothing
of
movement
or
of
sound
no
lightning
no
thunder
and
soon
the
hot
breath
of
the
afternoon
had
itself
disappeared
before
the
advance
of
this
silent
pall
the
night
of
june
to
the
north
was
brighter
than
twilight
and
still
southward
a
deliberate
spectacle
stood
this
great
range
of
vague
and
menacing
cloud
shutting
off
the
sky
and
towering
above
the
downs
so
that
it
seemed
permissible
to
ascribe
to
those
protecting
gods
of
our
valley
a
burden
of
fear
just
when
all
that
scene
had
been
arranged
to
an
adjustment
that
no
art
could
have
attained
the
first
great
fire
blazed
out
miles
and
miles
to
the
west
somewhere
above
midhurst
i
think
near
no
man
land
then
we
saw
miles
to
the
east
again
a
glare
over
mount
harry
the
signal
of
lewes
and
one
after
another
all
the
heights
took
it
up
in
a
chain
above
bramber
above
poynings
above
wiston
on
amberley
mount
i
think
certainly
on
the
noble
sweep
of
bury
even
in
those
greater
distances
which
the
horizon
concealed
they
were
burning
and
answering
each
other
into
hampshire
perhaps
on
the
beaten
grass
of
the
high
forts
above
portsmouth
and
to
the
left
away
to
the
flat
rye
level
and
to
the
eastern
rother
for
we
saw
the
line
of
red
angry
upon
that
cloud
which
had
come
to
receive
it
an
endless
line
which
suddenly
called
up
what
one
had
heard
old
men
say
of
the
prairie
fires
it
was
easy
without
covering
the
face
and
without
abstracting
the
mind
from
the
whirl
of
modern
circumstance
it
was
easy
merely
looking
at
the
thing
to
be
seized
with
an
impression
of
disaster
the
stars
were
so
pale
on
the
lingering
white
light
of
the
pure
north
the
smoky
cloud
so
deep
and
heavy
and
steadfast
and
low
above
the
hills
the
fire
so
near
to
it
so
sharp
against
it
and
so
huge
that
the
awe
and
sinister
meaning
of
conflagrations
dominated
the
impression
of
all
the
scene
there
arose
in
the
mind
that
memory
which
associates
such
a
glare
and
the
rising
and
falling
fury
of
flames
with
sacrifice
or
with
vengeance
or
with
the
warning
of
an
enemy
approach
or
with
the
mark
of
his
conquest
for
with
such
things
our
race
for
how
many
thousand
years
has
watched
the
fires
upon
the
hills
far
off
it
touched
one
as
does
the
reiterated
note
of
a
chaunt
if
not
with
an
impression
of
doom
at
least
with
that
of
calamity
when
the
fires
had
died
down
to
a
sullen
glow
and
the
men
watching
them
had
gone
home
under
the
weight
of
what
they
had
seen
the
storm
broke
and
occupied
the
whole
sky
a
very
low
wind
rose
and
a
furious
rain
fell
it
became
suddenly
cold
there
was
thunder
all
over
the
weald
and
the
lightning
along
the
unseen
crest
of
the
downs
answered
the
lightning
above
the
forest
the
man
of
the
desert
i
lay
once
alone
upon
the
crest
of
a
range
whose
name
i
have
never
seen
spelt
but
which
is
pronounced
haueedja
from
whence
a
man
can
see
right
away
for
ever
the
expanse
of
the
sahara
it
is
well
known
that
mount
atlas
and
those
inhabited
lands
where
there
is
a
sufficient
rainfall
and
every
evidence
of
man
activity
the
province
of
africa
the
plateaux
which
are
full
of
the
memories
of
rome
end
abruptly
towards
the
sun
and
are
bounded
by
a
sort
of
cliff
which
falls
sheer
upon
the
desert
on
the
summit
of
this
cliff
i
lay
and
looked
down
upon
the
sand
it
was
impressed
upon
my
mind
that
here
was
an
influence
quite
peculiar
not
to
be
discovered
in
any
other
climate
of
the
world
that
all
europe
received
that
influence
and
yet
that
no
one
in
europe
had
accepted
it
save
for
his
hurt
god
forbid
that
any
man
should
pretend
that
the
material
environment
of
mankind
determines
the
destiny
of
mankind
those
who
say
such
things
have
abandoned
the
domain
of
intelligence
but
it
is
true
that
the
soul
eagerly
seeks
for
and
receives
the
impressions
of
the
world
about
it
and
will
be
moved
to
a
different
creed
or
to
a
different
poetry
according
as
the
body
perceives
the
sea
or
the
hills
or
the
rainless
and
inhuman
places
which
lie
to
the
south
of
europe
and
certainly
the
souls
of
those
races
which
have
inhabited
the
great
zone
of
calms
between
the
trade
winds
and
the
tropics
those
races
which
have
felt
nothing
beneficent
but
only
something
awful
and
unfamiliar
in
the
earth
and
sky
have
produced
a
peculiar
philosophy
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
this
philosophy
is
not
atheist
those
races
called
semitic
have
never
denied
either
the
presence
or
the
personality
of
god
it
is
on
the
contrary
their
boast
that
they
have
felt
his
presence
his
unity
and
his
personality
in
a
manner
more
pointed
than
have
the
rest
of
mankind
and
those
of
us
who
pretend
to
find
in
the
desert
a
mere
negation
are
checked
by
the
thought
that
within
the
desert
the
most
positive
of
religions
have
appeared
indeed
to
deny
god
has
been
the
sad
privilege
of
very
few
in
any
society
of
men
and
those
few
if
it
be
examined
have
invariably
been
men
in
whom
the
power
to
experience
was
deadened
usually
by
luxury
sometimes
by
distress
it
is
not
atheist
but
whatever
it
is
it
is
hurtful
and
has
about
it
something
of
the
despair
and
strength
of
atheism
consider
the
book
of
job
consider
the
arab
mohammedan
consider
the
fierce
heresies
which
besieged
the
last
of
the
romans
in
this
province
of
africa
and
which
tortured
the
short
history
of
the
vandals
consider
the
modern
tragedies
which
develop
among
the
french
soldiers
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
of
this
wide
belt
of
sand
and
you
will
see
that
the
thing
which
the
sahara
and
its
prolongation
produce
is
something
evil
or
at
least
to
us
evil
there
is
in
the
idea
running
through
the
mind
of
the
desert
an
intensity
which
may
be
of
some
value
to
us
if
it
be
diluted
by
a
large
admixture
of
european
tradition
or
if
it
be
mellowed
and
transformed
by
a
long
process
of
time
but
which
if
we
take
it
at
its
source
and
inspire
ourselves
directly
from
it
warps
and
does
hurt
to
our
european
sense
it
may
be
taken
that
whatever
form
truth
takes
among
men
will
be
the
more
perfect
in
proportion
as
the
men
who
receive
that
form
are
more
fully
men
the
whole
of
truth
can
never
be
comprehended
by
anything
finite
and
truth
as
it
appears
to
this
species
or
to
that
is
most
true
when
the
type
which
receives
it
is
the
healthiest
and
the
most
normal
of
its
own
kind
the
truth
as
it
is
to
men
is
most
true
when
the
men
who
receive
it
are
the
healthiest
and
the
most
normal
of
men
we
in
europe
are
the
healthiest
and
most
normal
of
our
kind
it
is
to
us
that
the
world
must
look
for
its
headship
we
have
the
harbours
the
continual
presence
of
the
sea
through
all
our
polities
we
have
that
high
differentiation
between
the
various
parts
of
our
unity
which
makes
the
whole
of
europe
so
marvellous
an
organism
we
alone
change
without
suffering
decay
to
the
truth
as
europe
accepts
it
i
can
not
but
bow
down
for
if
that
is
not
the
truth
then
the
truth
is
not
to
be
found
upon
earth
but
there
conies
upon
us
perpetually
that
wind
of
africa
and
it
disturbs
us
as
i
lay
that
day
a
year
ago
upon
the
crest
of
the
mountain
my
whole
mind
was
possessed
with
the
influence
of
such
a
gale
day
after
day
after
day
the
silent
men
of
the
desert
go
forward
across
its
monotonous
horizons
their
mouths
are
flanked
with
those
two
deep
lines
of
patience
and
of
sorrow
which
you
may
note
in
all
the
ghettoes
of
europe
their
smile
when
they
smile
is
restrained
by
a
sort
of
ironic
strength
in
the
muscles
of
the
face
their
eyes
are
more
bright
than
should
be
eyes
of
happy
men
they
are
as
it
were
inured
to
sterility
there
is
nothing
in
them
of
that
repose
which
we
westerners
acquire
from
a
continual
contemplation
of
deep
pastures
and
of
innumerable
leaves
they
are
at
war
not
only
among
themselves
but
against
the
good
earth
in
a
silent
and
powerful
way
they
are
also
you
may
note
that
their
morals
are
an
angry
series
of
unexplained
commands
and
that
their
worship
does
not
include
that
fringe
of
wholly
pleasant
things
which
the
true
worship
of
a
true
god
must
surely
contain
all
is
as
as
their
rocks
and
as
unfruitful
as
their
dry
valleys
and
as
dreadful
as
their
brazen
sky
thou
shalt
not
this
that
and
the
other
their
god
is
jealous
he
is
vengeful
he
is
awfully
present
and
real
to
them
a
vision
of
that
demon
of
which
we
in
our
happier
countries
make
a
quaint
legend
he
catches
men
out
and
trips
them
up
he
has
but
little
relation
to
the
father
of
christian
men
who
made
the
downs
of
south
england
and
the
high
clouds
above
them
the
good
uses
of
the
world
are
forgotten
in
the
desert
or
fiercely
denied
love
is
impure
so
are
birth
and
death
and
eating
and
every
other
necessary
part
in
the
life
of
a
man
and
yet
though
all
these
things
are
impure
there
is
no
lustration
we
also
feel
in
a
genial
manner
that
this
merry
body
of
ours
requires
apology
but
those
others
to
south
of
us
have
no
toleration
in
their
attitude
they
are
awfully
afraid
i
have
continually
considered
as
i
have
read
my
history
the
special
points
in
which
their
influence
is
to
be
observed
in
the
development
of
europe
it
takes
the
form
of
the
great
heresies
the
denial
of
the
importance
of
matter
sometimes
of
its
existence
the
denial
that
anything
but
matter
exists
the
denial
of
the
family
the
denial
of
ownership
the
which
is
peculiarly
a
desert
product
runs
through
all
such
follies
as
does
the
rejection
of
a
central
and
governing
power
upon
earth
which
is
again
just
such
a
rebellion
as
the
desert
would
bring
i
say
the
great
heresies
are
the
main
signs
of
that
influence
but
it
is
in
small
and
particular
matters
that
you
may
see
its
effect
most
clearly
for
instance
the
men
of
the
desert
are
afraid
of
wine
they
have
good
reason
if
you
drink
wine
in
the
desert
you
die
in
the
desert
a
man
can
drink
only
water
and
when
he
gets
it
it
is
like
diamonds
to
him
or
better
still
it
is
like
rejuvenation
all
our
long
european
legends
which
denounce
and
bring
a
curse
upon
the
men
who
are
the
enemies
of
wine
are
legends
inspired
by
our
hatred
of
the
thing
which
is
not
europe
and
that
bounds
europe
and
is
the
enemy
of
europe
so
also
with
their
attachment
to
numbers
for
instance
the
seventh
day
must
have
about
it
something
awful
and
oppressive
the
fast
must
be
seven
times
seven
days
and
so
forth
we
europeans
have
always
smiled
in
our
hearts
at
these
things
we
would
take
this
day
or
that
and
make
up
a
scheme
of
great
and
natural
complexity
full
of
interlacing
seasons
and
nearly
all
our
special
days
were
days
of
rejoicing
we
carried
images
about
our
fields
further
to
develop
and
enhance
the
nature
of
our
religion
we
dedicated
trees
and
caves
and
the
feasts
of
one
place
were
not
the
feasts
of
another
but
to
the
men
of
the
desert
mere
unfruitful
number
was
a
god
then
again
the
word
especially
the
written
word
the
document
overshadows
their
mind
it
has
always
had
for
them
a
power
of
something
mysterious
to
engrave
characters
was
to
cast
a
spell
and
when
they
seek
for
some
infallible
authority
upon
earth
they
can
only
discover
it
in
the
written
characters
traced
in
a
sacred
book
all
their
expression
of
worship
is
wrought
through
symbols
with
us
the
symbol
is
clearly
retained
separate
from
that
for
which
it
stands
though
hallowed
by
that
for
which
it
stands
with
them
the
symbol
is
the
whole
object
of
affection
on
this
account
you
will
find
in
the
men
of
the
desert
a
curious
panic
in
the
presence
of
statues
which
is
even
more
severe
than
the
panic
they
suffer
in
the
presence
of
wine
it
is
as
though
they
said
to
themselves
take
this
away
if
you
leave
it
here
i
shall
worship
it
they
are
subject
to
possession
side
by
side
with
this
fear
of
the
graphic
representation
of
men
or
of
animals
you
will
find
in
them
an
incapacity
to
represent
them
well
the
art
of
the
iconoclasts
is
either
childish
weak
or
at
its
strongest
evil
and
especially
among
all
these
symptoms
of
the
philosophy
from
which
they
suffer
is
their
manner
of
comprehending
the
nature
of
creation
of
creation
in
any
form
they
are
afraid
and
the
infinite
creator
is
on
that
account
present
to
them
almost
as
though
he
were
a
man
for
when
we
are
afraid
of
things
we
see
them
very
vividly
indeed
on
this
account
you
will
find
in
the
legends
of
the
men
of
the
desert
all
manner
of
fantastic
tales
incomprehensible
to
us
europeans
wherein
god
walks
talks
eats
and
wrestles
nor
is
there
any
trace
in
this
attitude
of
theirs
of
parable
or
of
allegory
that
mixture
of
the
truth
and
of
a
subtle
unreal
glamour
which
expands
and
confirms
the
truth
is
a
mixture
proper
to
our
hazy
landscapes
to
our
drowsy
woods
and
to
our
large
vision
we
who
so
often
see
from
our
high
village
squares
soft
and
distant
horizons
mountains
now
near
now
very
far
according
as
the
weather
changes
we
who
are
perpetually
feeling
the
transformation
of
the
seasons
and
who
are
immersed
in
a
very
ocean
of
manifold
and
mysterious
life
we
need
create
and
live
by
legends
the
line
between
the
real
and
imaginary
is
vague
and
penumbral
to
us
we
are
justly
influenced
by
our
twilights
and
our
imagination
teaches
us
how
many
deities
have
we
not
summoned
up
to
inhabit
groves
and
lakes
special
deities
who
are
never
seen
but
yet
have
never
died
to
the
men
of
the
desert
doubt
and
beauty
mingled
in
this
fashion
seemed
meaningless
that
which
they
worship
they
see
and
almost
handle
in
the
dreadful
silence
which
surrounds
them
their
illusions
turn
into
convictions
the
haunting
voices
are
heard
the
forms
are
seen
of
two
further
things
native
to
us
their
starved
experience
has
no
hold
of
nationality
or
if
the
term
be
preferred
of
the
city
and
of
what
we
have
come
to
call
chivalry
the
two
are
but
aspects
of
one
thing
without
a
name
but
that
thing
all
europeans
possess
nor
is
it
possible
for
us
to
conceive
of
a
patriotism
unless
it
is
a
patriotism
which
is
chivalric
in
our
earliest
stories
we
honour
men
fighting
odds
our
epics
are
of
small
numbers
against
great
humility
and
charity
are
in
them
lending
a
kind
of
magic
strength
to
the
sword
the
faith
did
not
bring
in
that
spirit
but
rather
completed
it
our
boundaries
have
always
been
intensely
sacred
to
us
we
are
not
passionate
to
cross
them
save
for
the
sake
of
adventure
but
we
are
passionate
to
defend
them
in
all
that
enormous
story
of
rome
from
the
dim
etrurian
origins
right
up
to
the
end
of
her
thousand
years
the
wall
of
the
town
was
more
sacred
than
the
limits
of
the
empire
the
men
of
the
desert
do
not
understand
these
things
they
are
by
compulsion
nomad
and
for
ever
wandering
they
strike
no
root
their
pride
is
in
mere
expansion
they
must
colonise
or
fail
nor
does
any
man
die
for
a
city
as
i
looked
from
the
mountain
i
thought
the
desert
which
i
had
come
so
far
to
see
had
explained
to
me
what
hitherto
i
had
not
understood
in
the
mischances
of
europe
i
remained
for
a
long
while
looking
out
upon
the
glare
but
when
i
came
down
again
northward
from
the
high
sandstone
hill
and
was
in
the
fields
again
near
running
water
and
drinking
wine
from
a
cup
carved
with
roman
emblems
i
began
to
wonder
whether
the
desert
had
not
put
before
my
mind
as
they
say
it
can
do
before
the
eye
of
the
traveller
a
mirage
is
there
such
an
influence
are
there
such
men
the
departure
once
in
barbary
i
grew
tired
of
unusual
things
especially
of
palms
and
desired
to
return
to
europe
and
the
things
i
knew
so
i
went
down
from
the
hills
to
the
sea
coast
and
when
after
two
days
i
had
reached
the
railway
i
took
a
train
for
algiers
and
reached
that
port
at
evening
from
algiers
it
is
possible
to
go
at
once
and
for
almost
any
sum
one
chooses
to
any
part
of
the
world
the
town
is
on
a
sharp
slope
of
a
theatre
of
hills
and
in
the
quiet
harbour
below
it
there
are
all
sorts
of
ships
but
mostly
steamships
moored
with
their
sterns
towards
the
quay
for
there
is
no
tide
here
and
the
ships
can
lie
quite
still
i
sat
upon
a
wall
of
the
upper
town
and
considered
how
each
of
these
ships
were
going
to
some
different
place
and
how
pleasant
it
was
to
roam
about
the
world
behind
the
ships
along
the
stone
quays
were
a
great
number
of
wooden
huts
of
offices
built
into
archways
of
little
houses
booths
and
dens
in
each
of
which
you
could
take
your
passage
to
some
place
or
other
now
said
i
to
myself
now
is
the
time
to
be
free
for
one
never
feels
master
of
oneself
unless
one
is
obeying
no
law
plan
custom
trend
or
necessity
but
simply
spreading
out
at
ease
and
occupying
the
world
in
this
also
aristotle
was
misled
by
fashion
or
was
by
some
friend
of
his
or
was
perhaps
lying
for
money
when
he
said
that
liberty
was
obedience
to
a
law
for
the
most
distant
hint
of
law
is
odious
to
liberty
true
it
is
more
free
to
obey
a
law
of
one
own
making
than
of
some
one
else
just
as
if
a
man
should
give
himself
a
punch
in
the
eye
it
would
be
less
hurtful
and
far
less
angering
than
one
given
by
a
yet
to
suffer
either
would
not
be
a
benefit
of
freedom
liberty
can
not
breathe
where
the
faintest
odour
of
regulation
is
to
be
discovered
but
only
in
that
ether
whose
very
nature
is
largeness
oh
diviner
air
how
few
have
drunk
you
and
in
what
deep
draughts
have
i
i
had
a
great
weight
of
coined
golden
metallic
money
all
loose
in
my
pocket
there
was
no
call
upon
me
nor
any
purpose
before
me
i
spent
an
hour
looking
down
upon
the
sea
and
the
steamships
and
taking
my
pick
out
of
all
the
world
one
thing
however
guided
me
which
was
this
that
desire
to
be
satisfied
at
all
must
be
satisfied
at
once
and
of
the
many
new
countries
i
might
seek
that
would
most
attract
me
whose
ship
was
starting
soonest
so
i
looked
round
for
mooring
cables
in
the
place
of
anchor
chains
for
blue
peter
for
smoke
from
funnels
for
little
boats
coming
and
going
and
for
all
that
shows
a
steamboat
to
be
off
when
i
saw
just
behind
a
large
new
boat
in
such
a
condition
of
bustle
a
sign
in
huge
yellow
letters
staring
on
a
bright
black
ground
which
said
to
the
balearic
islands
eight
shillings
underneath
in
smaller
yellow
letters
was
written
gentlemen
the
honourable
travellers
are
warned
that
they
must
pay
for
any
food
they
consume
when
i
had
read
this
notice
i
said
to
myself
i
will
go
to
the
balearic
islands
of
which
the
rich
have
never
heard
i
poor
and
unencumbered
will
go
and
visit
these
remote
places
which
have
in
their
time
received
all
the
influences
of
the
world
and
which
yet
have
no
history
for
i
am
tired
of
this
africa
where
so
many
men
are
different
from
me
as
i
said
this
to
myself
i
saw
a
little
picture
in
my
mind
of
three
small
islands
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
quite
alone
and
inhabited
by
happy
men
but
this
picture
as
it
always
is
with
such
pictures
was
not
at
all
the
same
as
what
i
saw
when
next
morning
the
islands
rose
along
the
north
to
which
we
steered
i
went
down
to
the
quay
by
some
large
stone
steps
which
an
englishman
had
built
many
years
ago
and
i
entered
the
office
above
which
this
great
sign
was
raised
within
was
a
tall
man
of
doubtful
race
smoking
a
cigarette
made
of
loose
paper
and
gazing
kindly
at
the
air
he
was
full
of
reveries
of
this
man
i
asked
when
the
boat
would
be
starting
he
told
me
it
started
in
half
an
hour
a
little
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
so
i
bought
a
ticket
for
eight
shillings
upon
which
it
was
clearly
printed
in
two
languages
that
i
had
bound
myself
to
all
manner
of
things
by
the
purchase
and
especially
that
i
might
not
go
below
but
must
sit
upon
deck
all
night
nevertheless
i
was
glad
to
hold
that
little
bit
of
printed
prose
for
it
would
enable
me
to
reach
the
balearic
islands
which
for
all
other
men
are
names
in
a
dream
i
then
went
up
into
the
town
of
algiers
and
was
careful
to
buy
some
ham
from
a
jew
some
wine
from
a
mohammedan
and
some
bread
and
chocolate
from
a
very
indifferent
christian
after
that
i
got
aboard
as
i
came
over
the
side
i
heard
the
sailors
stokers
and
people
all
talking
to
each
other
in
low
tones
and
i
at
once
recognised
the
tongue
called
catalan
i
had
heard
this
sort
of
latin
in
many
places
some
lonely
and
some
populous
i
had
heard
it
once
from
a
chemist
at
perpignan
who
dressed
a
wound
of
mine
and
this
was
the
first
time
i
heard
it
very
often
after
in
the
valleys
of
the
pyrenees
in
the
cerdagne
and
especially
in
andorra
hundreds
of
men
had
spoken
to
me
in
catalan
at
urgel
that
notable
city
where
there
is
only
one
shop
and
where
the
streets
are
quite
narrow
and
moorish
a
woman
and
six
or
seven
men
had
spoken
catalan
to
me
for
nearly
one
hour
it
was
in
a
cellar
surrounded
by
great
barrels
and
i
remember
it
well
so
also
on
the
river
noguera
coming
up
again
into
the
hills
a
girl
who
took
the
toll
at
the
wooden
bridge
had
spoken
catalan
to
me
but
none
of
these
had
i
ever
answered
so
that
they
could
understand
and
on
this
account
i
was
very
grieved
to
hear
the
catalan
tongue
though
i
remembered
that
if
i
spoke
to
them
with
ordinary
spanish
words
or
in
french
with
a
strong
southern
accent
they
would
usually
have
some
idea
of
what
i
was
saying
as
the
evening
fell
the
cables
were
slipped
without
songs
and
with
great
dignity
rapidity
and
order
the
ship
was
got
away
i
knew
a
man
once
a
seafaring
man
a
scotchman
with
whom
i
travelled
on
a
very
slow
old
boat
in
the
atlantic
who
told
me
that
the
northern
people
of
europe
were
bravest
in
a
unexpected
danger
but
the
southern
in
a
danger
long
foreseen
he
said
he
had
known
many
of
both
kinds
and
had
served
under
them
and
commanded
them
he
said
that
in
sudden
accident
the
northerner
was
the
more
reliable
man
but
that
if
an
act
of
great
danger
had
to
be
planned
and
coolly
achieved
then
the
southerner
was
strongest
in
doing
what
he
had
to
do
he
said
that
in
taking
the
ground
he
would
rather
have
a
northern
but
in
bringing
in
a
short
ship
a
southern
crew
he
was
a
man
who
observed
closely
and
never
said
a
thing
because
he
had
read
it
indeed
he
did
not
read
and
he
had
in
a
little
hanging
shelf
above
his
bunk
only
four
or
five
tattered
books
and
even
these
were
magazines
i
remembered
his
testimony
now
as
i
watched
these
catalans
letting
the
ship
go
free
and
i
believed
it
comparing
it
with
history
and
the
things
i
had
myself
seen
they
did
everything
with
such
regularity
and
so
silently
that
it
was
a
different
deck
from
what
one
would
have
had
in
the
heave
of
the
channel
with
normans
or
bretons
or
cornishmen
or
men
of
kent
but
especially
with
men
from
london
river
there
would
have
been
all
sorts
of
cursing
and
bellowing
and
they
could
not
have
touched
a
rope
without
throwing
themselves
into
attitudes
of
violence
but
these
men
took
the
sea
quite
quietly
nor
could
you
tell
from
their
faces
which
was
rich
and
which
was
poor
it
was
not
till
the
ship
was
out
throbbing
swiftly
over
the
smooth
sea
and
darkness
had
fallen
that
they
began
to
sing
then
those
of
them
who
were
not
working
gathered
together
with
a
stringed
instrument
forward
and
sang
of
pity
and
of
death
one
of
them
said
to
me
knight
can
your
grace
sing
i
told
him
that
i
could
sing
certainly
but
that
my
singing
was
unpleasing
and
that
i
only
knew
foreign
songs
he
said
that
singing
was
a
great
solace
and
desired
to
hear
a
song
of
my
own
country
so
i
sang
them
a
song
out
of
sussex
to
which
they
listened
in
deep
silence
and
when
it
was
concluded
their
leader
snapped
and
twanged
at
the
strings
again
and
began
another
song
about
the
riding
of
horses
in
the
hills
so
we
passed
the
short
night
until
the
sky
upon
our
quarter
grew
faintly
pale
and
the
little
wind
that
rises
before
morning
awakened
the
sea
the
idea
of
a
pilgrimage
a
pilgrimage
is
of
course
an
expedition
to
some
venerated
place
to
which
a
vivid
memory
of
sacred
things
experienced
or
a
long
and
wonderful
history
of
human
experience
in
divine
matters
or
a
personal
attraction
affecting
the
soul
impels
one
this
is
i
say
its
essence
so
a
pilgrimage
may
be
made
to
the
tomb
of
descartes
in
paris
or
it
may
be
a
little
walk
uphill
to
a
neighbouring
and
beloved
grave
or
a
modern
travel
even
in
luxury
on
the
impulse
to
see
something
that
greatly
calls
one
but
there
has
always
hung
round
the
idea
of
a
pilgrimage
with
all
people
and
at
all
times
i
except
those
very
rare
and
highly
decadent
generations
of
history
in
which
no
pilgrimages
are
made
nor
any
journeys
save
for
curiosity
or
greed
there
has
always
hung
round
it
i
say
something
more
than
the
mere
objective
just
as
in
general
worship
you
will
have
noble
gowns
vivid
colour
and
majestic
music
symbols
but
necessary
symbols
of
the
great
business
you
are
at
so
in
this
particular
case
of
worship
clothes
as
it
were
and
accoutrements
gather
round
one
principal
action
i
will
visit
the
grave
of
a
saint
or
of
a
man
whom
i
venerate
privately
for
his
virtues
and
deeds
but
on
my
way
i
wish
to
do
something
a
little
difficult
to
show
at
what
a
price
i
hold
communion
with
his
and
also
on
toy
way
i
will
see
all
i
can
of
men
and
things
for
anything
great
and
worthy
is
but
an
ordinary
thing
transfigured
and
if
i
am
about
to
venerate
a
humanity
absorbed
into
the
divine
so
it
behoves
me
on
my
journey
to
it
to
enter
into
and
delight
in
the
divine
that
is
hidden
in
everything
thus
i
may
go
upon
a
pilgrimage
with
no
pack
and
nothing
but
a
stick
and
my
clothes
but
i
must
get
myself
into
the
frame
of
mind
that
carries
an
invisible
burden
an
eye
for
happiness
and
suffering
humour
gladness
at
the
beauty
of
the
world
a
readiness
for
raising
the
heart
at
the
vastness
of
a
wide
view
and
especially
a
readiness
to
give
multitudinous
praise
to
god
for
a
man
that
goes
on
a
pilgrimage
does
best
of
all
if
he
starts
out
i
say
it
of
his
temporal
object
only
with
the
heart
of
a
wanderer
eager
for
the
world
as
it
is
forgetful
of
maps
or
descriptions
but
hungry
for
real
colours
and
men
and
the
seeming
of
things
this
desire
for
reality
and
contact
is
a
kind
of
humility
this
pleasure
in
it
a
kind
of
charity
it
is
surely
in
the
essence
of
a
pilgrimage
that
all
vain
imaginations
are
controlled
by
the
greatness
of
our
object
thus
if
a
man
should
go
to
see
the
place
where
as
they
say
peter
met
our
lord
on
the
appian
way
at
dawn
he
will
not
care
very
much
for
the
niggling
of
pedants
about
this
or
that
building
or
for
the
rhetoric
of
posers
about
this
or
that
beautiful
picture
if
a
thing
in
his
way
seem
to
him
frankly
ugly
he
will
easily
treat
it
as
a
neutral
forget
it
and
pass
it
by
if
on
the
contrary
he
find
a
beautiful
thing
whether
done
by
god
or
by
man
he
will
remember
and
love
it
this
is
what
children
do
and
to
get
the
heart
of
a
child
is
the
end
surely
of
any
act
of
religion
in
such
a
temper
he
will
observe
rather
than
read
and
though
on
his
way
he
can
not
do
other
than
remember
the
names
of
places
saying
why
these
are
the
alps
of
which
i
have
read
here
is
florence
of
which
i
have
heard
so
many
rich
women
talk
yet
he
will
never
let
himself
argue
and
decide
or
put
himself
so
to
speak
before
an
audience
in
his
own
mind
for
that
is
pride
which
all
of
us
moderns
always
fall
into
he
will
on
the
contrary
go
into
everything
with
curiosity
and
pleasure
and
be
a
brother
to
the
streets
and
trees
and
to
all
the
new
world
he
finds
the
alps
that
he
sees
with
his
eyes
will
be
as
much
more
than
the
names
he
reads
about
the
florence
of
his
desires
as
much
more
than
the
florence
of
as
beauty
loved
is
more
than
beauty
heard
of
or
as
our
own
taste
smell
hearing
touch
and
sight
are
more
than
the
vague
relations
of
others
nor
does
religion
exercise
in
our
common
life
any
function
more
temporarily
valuable
than
this
that
it
makes
us
be
sure
at
least
of
realities
and
look
very
much
askance
at
philosophies
and
imaginaries
and
academic
whimsies
look
then
how
a
pilgrimage
ought
to
be
nothing
but
a
nobler
kind
of
travel
in
which
according
to
our
age
and
inclination
we
tell
our
tales
or
draw
our
pictures
or
compose
our
songs
it
is
a
very
great
error
and
one
unknown
before
our
most
recent
corruptions
that
the
religious
spirit
should
be
so
superficial
and
so
as
to
dominate
our
method
of
action
at
special
times
and
to
be
absent
at
others
it
is
better
occasionally
to
travel
in
one
way
or
another
to
some
beloved
place
or
to
some
place
wonderful
and
desired
for
its
associations
haunted
by
our
mission
yet
falling
into
every
ordinary
levity
than
to
go
about
a
common
voyage
in
a
chastened
and
devout
spirit
i
fear
this
is
bad
theology
and
i
propound
it
subject
to
authority
but
surely
if
a
man
should
say
i
will
go
to
redditch
to
buy
needles
cheap
and
all
the
way
take
care
to
speak
no
evil
of
his
neighbour
to
keep
very
sober
to
be
punctual
in
his
accounts
and
to
say
his
regular
prayers
with
exactitude
though
that
would
be
a
good
work
yet
if
he
is
to
be
a
and
the
church
has
a
hundred
gates
i
would
rather
for
the
moment
that
he
went
off
in
a
gay
tramping
spirit
not
oversure
of
his
expenses
not
very
careful
of
all
he
said
or
did
but
illuminated
and
increasingly
informed
by
the
great
object
of
his
voyage
which
is
here
not
to
buy
or
sell
needles
or
what
not
but
to
loose
the
mind
and
purge
it
in
the
ultimate
contemplation
of
something
divine
there
is
indeed
that
kind
of
pilgrimage
which
some
few
sad
men
undertake
because
their
minds
are
overburdened
by
a
sin
or
tortured
with
some
great
care
that
is
not
of
their
own
fault
these
are
excepted
from
the
general
rule
though
even
to
these
a
very
human
spirit
comes
by
the
way
and
the
adventures
of
inns
and
foreign
conversations
broaden
the
world
for
them
and
lighten
their
burden
but
this
kind
of
pilgrimage
is
rare
and
special
having
its
peculiar
virtues
the
common
sort
which
how
many
men
undertake
under
another
name
is
a
separate
and
human
satisfaction
of
a
need
the
fulfilling
of
an
instinct
in
us
the
realisation
of
imagined
horizons
the
reaching
of
a
goal
for
whoever
yet
that
was
alive
reached
an
end
and
could
say
he
was
satisfied
yet
who
has
not
desired
so
to
reach
an
end
and
to
be
satisfied
well
pilgrimage
is
for
the
most
a
sort
of
prefiguring
or
rehearsal
a
man
says
i
will
play
in
show
but
a
show
stiffened
with
a
real
and
just
object
at
that
great
part
which
is
all
we
can
ever
play
here
i
start
from
home
and
there
i
reach
a
goal
and
on
the
way
i
laugh
and
watch
sing
and
work
now
i
am
at
ease
and
again
hampered
now
poor
now
rich
weary
towards
the
end
and
at
last
arrived
at
that
end
so
my
great
life
is
and
so
this
little
chapter
shall
be
thus
he
packs
up
the
meaning
of
life
into
a
little
space
to
be
able
to
look
at
it
closely
as
men
carry
with
them
small
locket
portraits
of
their
birthplace
or
of
those
they
love
if
a
pilgrimage
is
all
this
it
is
evident
that
however
careless
it
must
not
be
untroublesome
it
would
be
a
contradiction
of
pilgrimage
to
seek
to
make
the
journey
short
and
rapid
merely
consuming
the
mind
for
nothing
as
is
our
modern
habit
for
they
seem
to
think
nowadays
that
to
remain
as
near
as
possible
to
what
one
was
at
starting
and
to
usual
rut
is
the
great
good
of
travel
as
though
a
man
should
run
through
the
only
to
note
the
barbarous
absurdity
of
the
greek
characters
or
through
catullus
for
the
sake
of
discovering
such
words
as
were
like
enough
to
english
that
is
not
the
spirit
of
a
pilgrimage
at
all
the
pilgrim
is
humble
and
devout
and
human
and
charitable
and
ready
to
smile
and
admire
therefore
he
should
comprehend
the
whole
of
his
way
the
people
in
it
and
the
hills
and
the
clouds
and
the
habits
of
the
various
cities
and
as
to
the
method
of
doing
this
we
may
go
bicycling
though
that
is
a
little
flurried
or
driving
though
that
is
luxurious
and
dangerous
because
it
brings
us
constantly
against
servants
and
flattery
but
the
best
way
of
all
is
on
foot
where
one
is
a
man
like
any
other
man
with
the
sky
above
one
and
the
road
beneath
and
the
world
on
every
side
and
time
to
see
all
so
also
i
designed
to
walk
and
did
when
i
visited
the
tombs
of
the
apostles
the
arena
it
was
in
paris
in
his
room
on
the
hill
of
the
university
that
a
traveller
woke
and
wondered
what
he
should
do
with
his
day
in
some
way
i
can
not
tell
how
ephemeral
things
had
captured
his
mind
in
the
few
hours
he
had
already
spent
in
the
city
there
is
no
civilisation
where
the
various
parts
stand
so
separate
as
they
do
with
the
french
you
may
live
in
paris
all
your
life
and
never
suspect
that
there
is
a
garrison
of
eighty
thousand
men
within
call
you
may
spend
a
year
in
a
provincial
town
and
never
hear
that
the
large
building
you
see
daily
is
a
bishop
palace
or
you
may
be
the
guest
of
the
bishop
for
a
month
and
remain
under
the
impression
that
somewhere
hidden
away
in
the
place
there
is
a
powerful
clique
of
governing
atheists
whom
somehow
you
never
run
across
and
so
this
traveller
who
knew
paris
like
his
pocket
and
had
known
it
since
he
could
speak
plain
had
managed
to
gather
up
in
this
particular
visit
all
the
impressions
which
are
least
characteristic
of
the
town
he
had
dined
with
a
friend
at
pousset
he
had
passed
the
evening
at
the
exhibition
and
he
had
had
a
bare
touch
of
the
real
thing
in
the
rue
de
tournon
but
even
there
it
was
in
the
company
of
foreigners
therefore
i
repeat
he
woke
up
next
morning
wondering
what
he
should
do
for
the
veneer
of
paris
is
the
thinnest
in
the
world
and
he
had
exhausted
it
in
one
feverish
day
luckily
for
him
the
room
in
which
he
lay
was
french
and
had
been
french
for
a
hundred
years
you
looked
out
of
the
window
into
a
sky
cut
by
the
tall
mansard
roofs
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
over
the
stones
of
what
had
been
the
scotch
college
you
could
see
below
you
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
all
the
higher
points
of
the
island
especially
the
sainte
chapelle
and
the
vast
towers
of
the
cathedral
then
it
suddenly
struck
him
that
the
air
was
full
of
bells
now
it
is
a
curious
thing
and
one
that
every
traveller
will
bear
me
out
in
that
you
associate
a
country
place
with
the
sound
of
bells
but
a
capital
never
caen
is
noisy
enough
and
rouen
big
enough
one
would
think
to
drown
the
memory
of
music
yet
any
one
who
has
lived
in
his
normandy
remembers
their
perpetual
bells
and
as
for
the
admirable
town
of
chinon
where
no
one
ever
goes
i
believe
it
is
ringing
island
itself
but
paris
one
never
thinks
of
as
a
place
of
bells
and
yet
there
are
bells
enough
there
to
take
a
man
right
into
the
past
and
from
there
through
fairyland
to
hell
and
out
and
back
again
if
i
were
writing
of
the
bells
i
could
make
you
a
list
of
all
the
famous
bells
living
and
dead
that
haunt
the
city
and
the
tale
of
what
they
have
done
would
be
a
history
of
france
the
bell
of
the
bartholomew
over
against
the
louvre
the
tocsin
of
the
hotel
de
ville
that
rang
the
knell
of
the
monarchy
the
bell
of
julien
that
is
as
old
as
the
university
the
old
bourdon
of
notre
dame
that
first
rang
when
louis
brought
in
the
crown
of
thorns
and
the
peal
that
saluted
napoleon
and
the
new
bourdon
that
is
made
of
the
guns
of
sebastopol
and
the
savoyarde
up
on
montmartre
a
new
bell
much
larger
than
the
rest
this
morning
the
air
was
full
of
them
they
came
up
to
the
height
on
which
the
traveller
lay
listening
they
came
clear
and
innumerable
over
the
distant
surge
of
the
streets
he
spent
an
hour
wondering
at
such
an
unusual
parliament
and
general
council
of
bells
then
he
said
to
himself
it
must
be
some
great
feast
of
the
church
he
was
in
a
world
he
had
never
known
before
he
was
like
a
man
who
gets
into
a
strange
country
in
a
dream
and
follows
his
own
imagination
instead
of
suffering
the
pressure
of
outer
things
or
like
a
boy
who
wanders
by
a
known
river
till
he
comes
to
unknown
gardens
so
anxious
was
he
to
take
possession
at
once
of
this
discovery
of
his
that
he
went
off
hurriedly
without
eating
or
drinking
thinking
only
of
what
he
might
find
he
desired
to
embrace
at
one
sight
all
that
paris
was
doing
on
a
day
which
was
full
of
louis
and
of
resurrection
the
thoughts
upon
thoughts
that
flow
into
the
mind
from
its
impression
as
water
creams
up
out
of
a
stone
fountain
at
a
river
head
disturbed
him
swelling
beyond
the
possibility
of
fulfilment
he
wished
to
see
at
once
the
fashionables
in
clotilde
and
the
greek
uniates
at
julien
and
the
empty
sorbonne
and
the
great
crowd
of
boys
at
stanislas
but
what
he
was
going
to
see
never
occurred
to
him
for
he
thought
he
knew
paris
too
well
to
approach
the
cathedral
notre
dame
is
jealously
set
apart
for
special
and
official
things
if
you
know
the
official
world
you
know
the
great
church
and
unless
some
great
man
had
died
or
some
victory
had
been
won
you
would
never
go
there
to
see
how
paris
took
its
religion
no
midnight
mass
is
said
in
it
for
the
lovely
carols
of
the
middle
ages
you
must
go
to
gervais
and
for
the
pomp
of
the
to
the
madeleine
for
soldiers
to
augustin
for
pilgrims
to
etienne
therefore
no
one
would
ever
have
thought
of
going
to
the
cathedral
on
this
day
when
an
instinct
and
revelation
of
paris
at
prayer
filled
the
mind
nevertheless
the
traveller
feet
went
of
their
own
accord
towards
the
seven
bridges
because
the
island
draws
all
paris
to
it
and
was
drawing
him
along
with
the
rest
he
had
meant
perhaps
to
go
the
way
that
all
the
world
has
gone
since
men
began
to
live
on
this
river
and
to
follow
up
the
roman
way
across
the
seine
a
vague
intention
of
getting
a
mass
at
merry
or
laurent
but
he
was
going
as
a
dream
sent
him
without
purpose
or
direction
the
sun
was
already
very
hot
and
the
parvis
was
blinding
with
light
when
he
crossed
the
little
bridge
then
he
noticed
that
the
open
place
had
dotted
about
it
little
groups
of
people
making
eastward
the
parvis
is
so
large
that
you
could
have
a
multitude
scattered
in
it
and
only
notice
that
the
square
was
not
deserted
there
were
no
more
than
a
thousand
perhaps
going
separately
to
notre
dame
and
a
thousand
made
no
show
in
such
a
square
but
when
he
went
in
through
the
doors
he
saw
there
something
he
had
never
seen
before
and
that
he
thought
did
not
exist
it
was
as
though
the
vague
interior
visions
of
which
the
morning
had
been
so
full
had
taken
on
reality
you
may
sometimes
see
in
modern
picture
galleries
an
attempt
to
combine
the
story
from
which
proceeds
the
nourishing
flame
of
christianity
with
the
crudities
and
the
shameful
ugliness
of
our
decline
thus
with
others
a
picture
of
our
lord
and
mary
magdalen
all
the
figures
except
that
of
our
lord
were
dressed
in
the
modern
way
i
remember
another
of
our
lord
and
the
little
children
where
the
scene
is
put
into
a
village
school
now
if
you
can
imagine
which
it
is
not
easy
to
do
such
an
attempt
to
be
successful
untouched
by
the
love
of
display
and
eccentricity
and
informing
as
it
commonly
pretends
to
inform
our
time
with
an
idea
then
you
will
understand
what
the
traveller
saw
that
morning
in
notre
dame
the
church
seemed
the
vastest
cavern
that
had
ever
been
built
for
worship
coming
in
from
the
high
morning
the
alone
with
which
we
always
connect
a
certain
majesty
and
presence
seemed
to
have
taken
on
amplitude
as
well
the
incense
veiled
what
appeared
to
be
an
infinite
lift
of
roof
and
the
third
great
measurement
the
length
of
nave
that
leads
like
a
forest
ride
to
the
lights
of
the
choir
were
drawn
out
into
an
immeasurable
perspective
by
reason
of
a
countless
crowd
of
men
and
women
divided
by
the
narrow
path
of
the
procession
so
full
was
this
great
place
that
a
man
moved
slowly
and
with
difficulty
edging
through
such
a
mass
of
folk
as
you
may
find
at
holiday
time
in
a
railway
station
or
outside
a
theatre
never
surely
before
was
a
church
like
this
unless
indeed
some
very
rich
or
very
famous
man
happened
to
be
gracing
it
but
here
for
nothing
but
the
function
proper
to
the
feast
the
cathedral
was
paved
and
floored
with
human
beings
in
the
galilee
there
was
a
kind
of
movement
so
that
a
man
could
get
up
further
and
at
last
the
traveller
found
a
place
to
stand
in
just
on
the
edge
of
the
open
gangway
at
the
very
end
of
the
nave
he
peered
up
this
and
saw
from
the
further
end
near
the
altar
the
head
of
the
procession
approaching
which
was
in
his
fancy
of
that
morning
like
the
line
of
the
faith
still
living
and
returning
in
a
perpetual
circle
to
revivify
the
world
moreover
there
was
in
the
advent
of
the
procession
a
kind
of
climax
as
it
came
nearer
the
great
crowd
moved
more
quickly
towards
it
children
were
lifted
up
and
by
one
of
sully
wide
pillars
a
group
of
three
young
soldiers
climbed
on
a
rail
to
see
the
great
sight
better
the
very
old
and
supported
by
his
priests
half
walked
and
half
tottered
down
the
length
of
the
people
his
head
grown
weary
with
age
barely
supported
the
mitre
from
which
great
jewels
false
or
true
were
flashing
in
his
hand
he
had
a
crozier
that
was
studded
in
the
same
way
with
gems
and
that
seemed
to
be
made
of
gold
the
same
hands
had
twisted
the
metal
of
it
as
had
hammered
the
hinges
of
the
cathedral
doors
certainly
there
here
appeared
one
of
the
resurrections
of
europe
the
matter
of
life
seemed
to
take
on
a
fuller
stuff
and
to
lift
into
a
dimension
above
that
in
which
it
ordinarily
moves
the
thin
narrow
and
unfruitful
experience
of
and
yesterday
was
amplified
by
all
the
lives
that
had
made
our
life
and
the
blood
of
which
we
are
only
a
last
expression
the
race
that
is
older
even
than
rome
seemed
in
this
revelation
of
continuity
to
be
gathered
up
into
one
intense
and
passionate
moment
the
pagan
altar
of
tiberius
the
legend
of
dionysius
the
whole
circle
of
the
wars
came
into
this
one
pageant
and
the
old
man
in
his
office
and
his
blessing
was
understood
by
all
the
crowd
before
him
to
transmit
the
centuries
a
rich
woman
thrust
a
young
child
forward
and
he
stopped
and
stooped
with
difficulty
to
touch
its
hair
as
he
approached
the
traveller
it
was
as
though
there
had
come
great
and
sudden
news
to
him
or
the
sound
of
unexpected
and
absorbing
music
the
procession
went
on
and
closed
the
high
mass
followed
it
lasted
a
very
long
time
and
the
traveller
went
out
before
the
crowd
had
moved
and
found
himself
again
in
the
glare
of
the
sun
on
the
parvis
he
went
over
the
bridge
to
find
his
near
the
archives
and
eat
the
first
food
of
that
day
thinking
as
he
went
that
certainly
there
are
an
infinity
of
lives
side
by
side
in
our
cities
and
each
ignores
the
rest
and
yet
that
to
pass
from
what
we
know
of
these
to
what
we
do
not
though
it
is
the
most
wonderful
journey
in
the
world
is
one
that
no
one
undertakes
unless
accident
or
a
good
fortune
pushes
him
on
he
desired
to
make
another
such
journey
he
came
back
to
find
me
in
london
and
spoke
to
me
of
paris
as
of
a
city
newly
discovered
as
i
listened
i
thought
i
saw
an
arena
in
a
plain
of
the
north
undistinguished
by
great
hills
open
to
the
torment
of
the
sky
the
gods
had
traced
an
arena
wherein
were
to
be
fought
out
the
principal
battles
of
a
later
age
spirits
lower
than
the
divine
spirits
intermediate
have
been
imagined
by
men
wiser
than
ourselves
to
have
some
power
over
the
world
a
power
which
we
might
vanquish
in
a
special
manner
but
still
a
power
to
such
conceptions
the
best
races
of
europe
cling
upon
such
a
soil
are
grown
the
legends
that
tell
us
most
about
our
dark
and
yet
enormous
human
fate
these
intermediate
spirits
have
been
called
in
all
the
older
creeds
the
gods
it
is
in
the
nature
of
the
church
to
frown
upon
these
dreams
but
i
as
i
listened
to
him
saw
clearly
that
plain
wherein
the
gods
had
marked
out
an
arena
for
mankind
it
was
oval
as
should
be
a
theatre
for
any
show
with
heights
around
it
insignificant
but
offering
a
vantage
ground
whence
could
be
watched
the
struggle
in
the
midst
there
was
a
sacred
centre
an
island
and
a
mount
and
within
the
lines
so
great
a
concourse
of
gladiatorial
souls
as
befits
the
greatest
of
spectacles
i
say
i
do
not
know
how
far
such
visions
are
permitted
nor
how
far
the
right
reason
of
the
church
condemns
them
but
the
dream
returned
to
me
very
powerfully
recalling
my
boyhood
when
the
traveller
told
me
his
story
i
also
therefore
went
and
caught
the
fresh
gale
of
the
stream
of
the
seine
in
flood
and
saw
the
many
roofs
of
paris
quite
clear
after
the
rain
and
read
the
writings
of
the
men
i
mixed
with
and
heard
the
noise
of
the
city
it
is
not
upon
the
paltry
level
of
negations
or
of
decent
philosophies
it
is
in
the
action
and
hot
mood
of
creative
certitudes
that
the
french
battle
is
engaged
the
little
sophists
are
dumb
and
terrified
their
books
are
quite
forgotten
i
myself
forgot
in
those
few
days
by
that
water
and
in
that
city
the
thin
and
ineffectual
bodies
of
ignorant
men
who
live
quite
beyond
any
knowledge
of
such
fires
the
printed
things
which
tired
and
poor
writers
put
down
for
pay
no
longer
even
disturbed
me
the
reflections
the
mere
phantasms
of
reality
with
which
in
a
secluded
measure
we
please
our
intellect
faded
i
was
like
a
man
who
was
in
the
centre
of
two
lines
that
meet
in
war
to
such
a
man
this
fellow
prose
on
fighting
and
that
one
verse
this
theory
of
strategy
or
that
essay
upon
arms
are
not
for
one
moment
remembered
here
in
the
narrow
street
which
i
knew
and
was
now
following
bernard
had
upheld
the
sacrament
in
the
shock
of
the
first
awakening
in
that
twelfth
century
when
julian
stirred
in
his
sleep
beyond
the
bridge
in
roman
walls
that
still
stand
carefully
preserved
the
church
of
gaul
had
sustained
athanasius
and
determined
the
course
of
the
christian
centuries
i
had
passed
upon
my
way
the
vast
and
empty
room
where
had
been
established
the
terror
where
had
been
forced
by
an
angry
and
compelling
force
the
full
return
of
equal
laws
upon
europe
who
could
remember
in
such
an
air
the
follies
and
the
pottering
of
men
who
analyse
and
put
in
categories
and
explain
the
follies
of
wealth
and
of
old
age
good
lord
how
little
the
academies
became
i
remembered
the
phrases
upon
one
side
and
upon
the
other
which
still
live
in
the
stones
of
the
city
carved
and
deep
but
more
lasting
than
are
even
the
letters
of
their
inscription
i
remembered
the
defiant
sentence
of
mad
dolet
on
his
statue
there
in
the
quarter
the
deliberate
perversion
of
plato
and
when
you
are
dead
you
shall
no
more
be
anything
at
all
i
remembered
the
ave
crux
spes
unica
and
just
the
words
that
we
have
spoken
will
never
be
lost
on
earth
and
danton
continual
daring
and
the
scribbled
greek
on
the
walls
of
the
cathedral
towers
for
not
only
are
the
air
and
the
voice
but
the
very
material
of
this
town
is
filled
with
words
that
remain
certainly
the
philosophies
and
the
negations
dwindled
to
be
so
small
as
at
last
to
disappear
and
to
leave
only
the
two
antagonists
passion
brooded
over
the
silence
of
the
morning
there
was
great
energy
in
the
cool
of
the
spring
air
and
up
above
the
forms
the
clouds
were
taking
were
forms
of
gigantic
powers
i
came
as
the
traveller
had
come
into
the
cathedral
it
was
not
yet
within
half
an
hour
of
the
feast
there
was
still
room
to
be
found
though
with
every
moment
the
nave
and
the
aisles
grew
fuller
until
one
doubted
how
at
the
end
so
great
a
throng
could
be
dismissed
they
were
of
all
kinds
some
few
were
strangers
holding
in
their
hands
books
about
the
building
some
few
were
devout
men
on
travel
and
praying
at
this
great
office
on
the
way
men
from
the
islands
men
from
the
places
that
spain
has
redeemed
for
the
future
in
the
new
world
i
saw
an
irishman
near
me
and
two
west
indians
also
half
negro
like
the
third
of
the
kings
that
came
to
worship
at
the
manger
where
our
lord
was
born
for
two
hours
and
nearly
three
i
saw
and
wondered
at
that
immense
concourse
the
tribunes
were
full
the
whole
choir
was
black
moving
with
the
celebrants
and
all
the
church
floor
beyond
and
around
me
was
covered
and
dark
with
expectant
men
the
bourdon
that
had
summoned
the
traveller
and
driven
mad
so
many
despairs
sounded
above
me
upon
this
day
with
amplitude
and
yet
with
menace
the
silence
was
a
solace
when
it
ceased
to
boom
the
creed
the
oldest
of
our
chaunts
filled
and
completed
those
walls
it
was
as
though
at
last
a
battle
had
been
joined
and
in
that
issue
a
great
relief
ran
through
the
crowd
from
such
a
temple
i
came
out
at
last
they
had
thrown
the
western
doors
wide
open
the
doors
whose
hinges
man
scarcely
could
have
hammered
and
to
whose
miracle
legend
has
lent
its
aid
the
midday
now
captured
by
the
sun
came
right
into
the
hollow
simplicity
of
the
nave
and
caught
the
river
of
people
as
they
flowed
outwards
but
even
that
and
the
cry
of
the
benediction
from
the
altar
gave
no
greater
peace
than
an
appeal
to
combat
in
the
air
outside
that
other
power
stood
waiting
to
conquer
or
to
fail
i
came
out
as
from
a
camp
into
the
civilian
debate
the
atmosphere
of
the
spectators
the
permanent
and
toppling
influence
against
which
this
bulwark
of
ours
the
faith
was
reared
as
we
say
by
god
himself
shouted
in
half
the
prints
in
half
the
houses
i
sat
down
to
read
and
compare
as
it
should
be
one
custom
when
one
is
among
real
and
determining
things
the
writings
of
the
extreme
that
is
of
the
leading
men
i
chose
the
two
pamphleteers
who
are
of
equal
weight
in
this
war
but
of
whom
one
only
is
known
as
yet
to
us
in
england
and
that
the
least
i
read
their
their
style
was
excellent
their
good
faith
shone
even
in
their
style
since
i
had
been
upon
phrases
all
these
hours
i
separated
and
remembered
the
principal
words
of
each
one
said
they
will
break
their
teeth
against
it
the
catholic
church
is
not
to
perish
for
she
has
allies
from
outside
time
the
other
said
how
long
will
the
death
of
this
crucified
god
linger
how
long
will
his
agony
crush
men
with
its
despair
but
i
read
these
two
writers
for
my
entertainment
only
and
in
order
to
be
acquainted
with
men
around
me
for
on
the
quarrel
between
them
i
had
long
ago
made
up
my
mind
at
the
sign
of
the
lion
it
was
late
and
the
day
was
already
falling
when
i
came
sitting
my
horse
monster
to
a
rise
of
land
we
were
at
a
walk
for
we
had
gone
very
far
since
early
morning
and
were
now
off
the
turf
upon
the
hard
road
moreover
the
hill
though
gentle
had
been
prolonged
from
its
summit
i
saw
before
me
as
i
had
seen
it
a
hundred
times
the
whole
of
the
weald
but
now
that
landscape
was
transfigured
because
many
influences
had
met
to
make
it
for
the
moment
an
enchanted
land
the
autumn
coming
late
had
crowded
it
with
colours
a
slight
mist
drew
out
the
distances
and
along
the
horizon
stood
out
quite
even
and
grey
like
mountains
the
solemn
presence
of
the
downs
over
all
this
the
sky
was
full
of
storm
in
some
manner
which
language
can
not
express
and
hardly
music
the
vision
was
unearthly
all
the
lesser
heights
of
the
plain
ministered
to
one
effect
a
picture
which
was
to
other
pictures
what
the
marvellous
is
to
the
experience
of
common
things
the
distant
mills
the
edges
of
heath
and
the
pine
trees
were
as
though
they
had
not
before
been
caught
by
the
eyes
of
travellers
and
would
not
after
the
brief
space
of
their
apparition
be
seen
again
here
was
a
countryside
whose
every
outline
was
familiar
and
yet
it
was
pervaded
by
a
general
quality
of
the
uplifted
and
the
strange
and
for
that
one
hour
under
the
sunset
the
county
did
not
seem
to
me
a
thing
well
known
but
rather
adored
the
glow
of
evening
which
had
seemed
to
put
this
horizon
into
another
place
and
time
than
ours
warned
me
of
darkness
and
i
made
off
the
road
to
the
right
for
an
inn
i
knew
of
that
stands
close
to
the
upper
arun
and
is
very
good
here
an
old
man
and
his
wife
live
easily
and
have
so
lived
for
at
least
thirty
years
proving
how
accessible
is
content
their
children
are
in
service
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
county
and
are
thus
provided
with
sufficiency
and
they
themselves
the
old
people
enjoy
a
small
possession
which
at
least
does
not
diminish
for
thank
god
their
land
is
free
it
is
a
square
of
pasture
bordered
by
great
elms
upon
three
sides
of
it
but
on
the
fourth
towards
the
water
a
line
of
pollard
willows
and
off
a
little
way
before
the
house
runs
arun
sliding
as
smooth
as
mincius
and
still
so
young
that
he
can
remember
the
lake
in
the
forest
where
he
rose
on
such
ancestral
land
these
two
people
await
without
anxiety
what
they
believe
will
be
a
kindly
death
nor
is
their
piety
of
that
violent
and
tortured
kind
which
is
associated
with
fear
and
with
distress
of
earlier
life
but
they
remain
peasants
drawing
from
the
earth
they
have
always
known
as
much
sustenance
for
the
soul
as
even
their
religion
can
afford
them
and
mixing
that
religion
so
intimately
with
their
experience
of
the
soil
that
were
they
not
isolated
in
an
evil
time
they
would
have
set
up
some
shrine
about
the
place
to
sanctify
it
the
passion
and
the
strain
which
must
accompany
even
in
the
happiest
and
most
secluded
the
working
years
of
life
have
so
far
disappeared
from
them
that
now
they
can
no
longer
recall
any
circumstances
other
than
those
which
they
enjoy
so
that
their
presence
in
a
room
about
one
as
they
set
rood
before
one
or
meet
one
at
the
door
is
in
itself
an
influence
of
peace
in
such
a
place
and
with
such
hosts
to
serve
him
be
wears
of
the
world
retire
for
a
little
time
from
an
evening
to
a
morning
and
a
man
can
enjoy
a
great
refreshment
in
such
a
place
he
will
eat
strongly
and
drink
largely
and
sleep
well
and
deeply
and
when
he
saddles
again
for
his
journey
he
will
take
the
whole
world
new
nor
are
those
intervals
without
their
future
value
for
the
memory
of
a
complete
repose
is
a
sort
of
sacrament
and
a
viaticum
for
the
weary
lengths
of
the
way
the
stable
of
this
place
is
made
of
oak
entirely
and
after
more
than
a
hundred
years
the
woodwork
is
still
sound
save
that
the
roof
now
falls
in
waves
where
the
great
beams
have
sagged
a
little
under
the
pressure
of
the
tiles
and
these
tiles
are
of
that
old
kind
which
whenever
you
find
them
you
will
do
well
to
buy
for
they
have
a
slight
downward
curve
to
them
and
so
they
fit
closer
and
shed
the
rain
better
than
if
they
were
flat
also
they
do
not
slip
and
thus
they
put
less
strain
upon
the
timber
this
excellent
stable
has
no
flooring
but
a
packed
layer
of
chalk
laid
on
the
ground
and
the
wooden
manger
is
all
polished
and
shining
where
it
has
been
rubbed
by
the
noses
of
ten
thousand
horses
since
the
great
war
that
polishing
was
helped
perhaps
by
the
nose
of
percy
horse
and
perhaps
by
the
nose
of
some
wheeler
who
in
his
time
had
dragged
the
guns
back
aboard
retreating
through
the
night
after
corunna
it
is
in
every
way
a
stable
that
a
small
peasant
should
put
up
for
himself
without
seeking
money
from
other
men
it
is
therefore
a
stable
which
your
gaping
scientists
would
condemn
and
though
as
yet
they
have
not
got
their
ugly
hands
upon
the
dwellings
of
beasts
as
they
have
upon
those
of
men
yet
i
often
fear
for
this
stable
and
am
always
glad
when
i
come
back
and
find
it
there
for
the
men
who
make
our
laws
are
the
same
as
those
that
sell
us
our
bricks
and
our
land
and
our
metals
and
they
make
the
laws
so
that
rebuilding
shall
go
on
and
vile
rebuilding
too
anyhow
this
stable
yet
stands
and
in
none
does
the
horse
monster
take
a
greater
delight
for
he
also
is
open
to
the
influence
of
holiness
so
i
led
him
in
and
tied
him
by
the
ancient
headstall
and
i
rubbed
him
down
and
i
washed
his
feet
and
covered
him
with
the
rough
rug
that
lay
there
and
when
i
had
done
all
that
i
got
him
oats
from
the
neighbouring
bin
for
the
place
knew
me
well
and
i
could
always
tend
to
my
own
beast
when
i
came
there
and
as
he
ate
his
oats
i
said
to
him
monster
my
horse
is
there
any
place
on
earth
where
a
man
even
for
a
little
time
can
be
as
happy
as
the
brutes
if
there
is
it
is
here
at
the
sign
of
the
lion
and
monster
answered
there
is
a
tradition
among
us
that
of
all
creatures
that
creep
upon
the
earth
man
is
the
fullest
of
sorrow
i
left
him
then
and
went
towards
the
house
it
was
quite
dark
and
the
windows
with
their
square
large
panes
and
true
proportions
shone
out
and
made
it
home
the
room
within
received
me
like
a
friend
the
open
chimney
at
its
end
round
which
the
house
is
built
was
filled
with
beech
logs
burning
and
the
candles
which
were
set
in
brass
mixed
their
yellow
light
with
that
of
the
fire
the
long
ceiling
was
low
as
are
the
ceilings
of
heaven
and
oak
was
here
everywhere
also
in
the
beams
and
the
shelves
and
the
mighty
table
for
oak
was
and
will
be
again
the
chief
wood
of
the
weald
when
they
put
food
and
ale
before
me
it
was
of
the
kind
which
has
been
english
ever
since
england
began
and
which
perhaps
good
fortune
will
preserve
over
the
breakdown
of
our
generation
until
we
have
england
back
again
one
could
see
the
hops
in
the
tankard
and
one
could
taste
the
barley
until
more
and
more
sunk
into
the
plenitude
of
this
good
house
one
could
dare
to
contemplate
as
though
from
a
distant
standpoint
the
corruption
and
the
imminent
danger
of
the
time
through
which
we
must
lead
our
lives
and
as
i
so
considered
the
ruin
of
the
great
cities
and
their
slime
i
felt
as
though
i
were
in
a
fortress
of
virtue
and
of
health
which
could
hold
out
through
the
pressure
of
the
war
and
i
thought
to
myself
perhaps
even
before
our
children
are
men
these
parts
which
survive
from
a
better
order
will
be
accepted
as
models
and
england
will
be
built
again
this
fantasy
had
not
time
tenuous
as
it
was
to
disappear
before
there
came
into
that
room
a
man
whose
gesture
and
bearing
promised
him
to
be
an
excellent
companion
but
in
whose
eyes
i
also
perceived
some
light
not
ordinary
he
was
of
middle
age
fifty
or
more
his
hair
was
crisp
and
grey
his
face
brown
as
though
he
had
been
much
upon
the
sea
he
was
tall
in
stature
and
of
some
strength
he
saluted
me
and
when
he
had
eaten
asked
me
if
i
also
were
familiar
with
this
inn
very
familiar
i
said
and
since
i
can
enter
it
at
any
hour
freely
it
is
now
more
familiar
to
me
even
than
the
houses
that
were
once
my
homes
for
nowadays
we
who
work
in
the
state
and
are
not
idle
must
be
driven
from
one
place
to
another
and
only
the
very
rich
have
certitude
and
continuity
but
to
them
it
is
of
no
service
for
they
are
too
idle
to
take
root
in
the
soil
yet
i
was
of
their
blood
he
said
and
there
is
in
this
county
a
home
which
should
be
mine
but
nothing
is
capable
of
endurance
i
have
not
seen
my
home
though
it
is
but
ten
miles
from
here
since
i
left
it
in
my
thirtieth
year
and
i
too
would
rather
come
to
this
inn
which
i
know
as
you
know
it
than
to
any
house
in
england
because
i
am
certain
of
entry
and
because
i
know
what
i
shall
find
and
because
what
i
find
is
what
any
man
of
this
county
should
find
if
the
soul
of
it
is
not
to
disappear
you
then
i
answered
we
were
now
seated
side
by
side
before
the
fire
with
but
one
flickering
candle
behind
us
and
on
the
floor
between
us
a
port
just
younger
than
the
host
you
then
come
here
for
much
the
same
reason
as
do
i
and
what
is
that
said
he
why
said
i
to
enjoy
the
illusion
that
change
can
somewhere
be
arrested
and
that
in
some
shape
a
part
at
least
of
the
things
we
love
remains
for
since
i
was
a
boy
and
almost
since
i
can
remember
everything
in
this
house
has
been
the
same
and
here
i
escape
from
the
threats
of
the
society
we
know
when
i
had
said
this
he
was
grave
and
silent
for
a
little
while
and
then
he
answered
it
is
impossible
i
think
after
many
years
to
recover
any
such
illusion
just
as
a
young
man
can
no
longer
think
himself
as
children
do
the
actor
in
any
drama
of
his
own
choosing
so
a
man
growing
old
as
am
i
can
no
longer
expect
of
any
society
and
least
of
all
of
his
own
the
gladness
that
comes
from
an
illusion
of
permanence
for
my
part
i
answered
in
turn
i
know
very
well
though
i
can
conjure
up
this
feeling
of
security
that
it
is
very
flimsy
stuff
and
i
take
it
rather
as
men
take
symbols
for
though
these
good
people
will
at
last
perish
and
some
brewer
a
colonel
of
volunteers
as
like
as
not
will
buy
this
little
field
and
though
for
the
port
we
are
drinking
there
will
be
imperial
port
and
for
the
beer
we
have
just
drunk
something
as
noisome
as
that
port
and
though
thistles
will
grow
up
in
the
good
pasture
ground
and
though
in
a
word
this
inn
will
become
a
hotel
and
will
perish
nevertheless
i
can
not
but
believe
that
england
remains
and
i
do
not
think
it
the
taking
of
a
drug
or
a
deliberate
cheating
of
oneself
to
come
and
steep
one
soul
in
what
has
already
endured
so
long
because
it
was
proper
to
our
country
all
that
you
say
he
answered
is
but
part
of
the
attempt
to
escape
necessity
your
very
frame
is
of
that
substance
for
which
permanence
means
death
and
every
one
of
all
the
emotions
that
you
know
is
of
its
nature
momentary
and
must
be
so
if
it
is
to
be
alive
yet
there
is
a
divine
thirst
i
said
for
something
that
will
not
so
perish
if
there
were
no
such
thirst
why
should
you
and
i
debate
such
things
or
come
here
to
the
lion
either
of
us
to
taste
antiquity
and
if
that
thirst
is
there
it
is
a
proof
that
there
is
for
us
some
end
and
some
such
satisfaction
for
my
part
as
i
know
of
nothing
else
i
can
not
but
seek
it
in
this
visible
good
world
i
seek
it
in
sussex
in
the
nature
of
my
home
and
in
the
tradition
of
my
blood
but
he
answered
no
it
is
not
thus
to
be
attained
the
end
of
which
you
speak
and
that
thirst
which
surely
is
divine
is
to
be
quenched
in
no
stream
that
we
can
find
by
journeying
not
even
in
the
little
rivers
that
run
here
under
the
combes
of
home
myself
well
then
what
is
the
end
he
i
have
sometimes
seen
it
clearly
that
when
the
disappointed
quest
was
over
all
this
journeying
would
turn
out
to
be
but
the
beginning
of
a
much
greater
adventure
and
that
i
should
set
out
towards
another
place
where
every
sense
should
be
fulfilled
and
where
the
fear
of
mutation
should
be
set
at
rest
myself
no
one
denies
that
such
a
picture
in
the
mind
haunts
men
their
whole
lives
through
though
after
they
have
once
experienced
loss
and
incompletion
and
especially
when
they
have
caught
sight
a
long
way
off
of
the
barrier
which
ends
all
our
experience
they
recognise
that
picture
for
a
cheat
and
surely
nothing
can
save
it
that
which
reasons
in
us
may
be
absolute
and
undying
for
it
is
outside
time
it
escapes
the
gropings
of
the
learned
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
material
things
but
as
for
all
those
functions
which
we
but
half
fulfil
in
life
surely
elsewhere
they
can
not
be
fulfilled
at
all
colour
is
for
the
eyes
and
music
is
for
the
ears
and
all
that
we
love
so
much
comes
in
by
channels
that
do
not
remain
he
yet
the
desire
can
only
be
for
things
that
we
have
known
and
the
desire
as
you
have
said
is
a
proof
of
the
thing
desired
and
but
for
these
things
which
we
know
the
words
and
and
would
have
no
meaning
myself
why
yes
but
though
desires
are
the
strongest
evidence
of
truth
yet
there
is
also
desire
for
illusions
as
there
is
a
waking
demand
for
things
attainable
and
a
demand
in
dreams
for
things
fantastic
and
unreal
every
analogy
increasingly
persuades
us
and
so
does
the
whole
scheme
of
things
as
we
learn
it
that
with
our
passing
there
shall
also
pass
speech
and
comfortable
fires
and
fields
and
the
voices
of
our
children
and
that
when
they
pass
we
lose
them
for
ever
he
yet
these
things
would
not
be
but
for
the
mind
which
receives
them
and
how
can
we
make
sure
what
channels
are
necessary
for
the
mind
and
may
not
the
mind
stretch
on
and
you
since
you
reject
my
guess
at
what
may
be
reserved
for
us
tell
me
what
is
the
end
which
we
shall
attain
myself
i
can
not
tell
then
he
continued
and
said
i
have
too
long
considered
these
matters
for
any
opposition
between
one
experience
and
another
to
affect
my
spirit
and
i
know
that
a
long
and
careful
inquiry
into
any
matter
must
lead
the
same
man
to
opposing
conclusions
but
for
my
part
i
shall
confidently
expect
throughout
that
old
age
which
is
not
far
from
me
that
when
it
ceases
i
shall
find
beyond
it
things
similar
to
those
which
i
have
known
for
all
i
here
enjoy
is
of
one
nature
and
if
the
life
of
a
man
be
bereft
of
them
at
last
then
it
is
falsehood
or
metaphor
to
use
the
word
you
think
then
said
i
that
some
immortal
part
in
us
is
concerned
not
only
with
our
knowledge
but
with
our
every
feeling
and
that
our
final
satisfaction
will
include
a
sensual
pleasure
fragrance
and
landscape
and
a
visible
home
that
shall
be
dearer
even
than
these
dear
hills
something
of
the
sort
he
said
and
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
they
were
broad
as
he
sat
beside
me
staring
at
the
fire
they
conveyed
in
their
attitude
that
effect
of
mingled
strength
and
weariness
which
is
common
to
all
who
have
travelled
far
and
with
great
purpose
perpetually
seeking
some
worthy
thing
which
they
could
never
find
the
fire
had
fallen
flames
no
longer
leapt
from
the
beech
logs
but
on
their
under
side
where
a
glow
still
lingered
embers
fell
the
autumn
and
the
fall
of
leaves
it
is
not
true
that
the
close
of
a
life
which
ends
in
a
natural
fashion
life
which
is
permitted
to
put
on
the
pomp
of
death
and
to
go
out
in
glory
inclines
the
mind
to
repose
it
is
not
true
of
a
day
ending
nor
the
passing
of
the
year
nor
of
the
fall
of
leaves
whatever
permanent
uneasy
question
is
native
to
men
comes
forward
most
insistent
and
most
loud
at
such
times
there
is
a
house
in
my
own
county
which
is
built
of
stone
whose
gardens
are
fitted
to
the
autumn
it
has
level
alleys
standing
high
and
banked
with
stone
their
ornaments
were
carved
under
the
influence
of
that
restraint
which
marked
the
stuarts
they
stand
above
old
ponds
and
are
strewn
at
this
moment
with
the
leaves
of
elms
these
walks
are
like
the
mailles
of
the
flemish
cities
the
walls
of
the
french
towns
or
the
terraces
of
the
loire
they
are
enjoyed
by
whoever
has
seen
all
our
time
go
racing
by
they
are
the
proper
of
the
aged
and
their
spirit
is
felt
especially
in
the
fall
of
leaves
at
this
season
a
sky
which
is
of
so
delicate
and
faint
a
blue
as
to
contain
something
of
gentle
mockery
and
certainly
more
of
tenderness
presides
at
the
fall
of
leaves
there
is
no
air
no
breath
at
all
the
leaves
are
so
light
that
they
sidle
on
their
going
downward
hesitating
in
that
which
is
not
void
to
them
and
touching
at
last
so
imperceptibly
the
earth
with
which
they
are
to
mingle
that
the
gesture
is
much
gentler
than
a
salutation
and
even
more
discreet
than
a
discreet
caress
they
make
a
little
sound
less
than
the
least
of
sounds
no
bird
at
night
in
the
marshes
rustles
so
slightly
no
man
though
men
are
the
subtlest
of
living
beings
put
so
evanescent
a
stress
upon
their
sacred
whispers
or
their
prayers
the
leaves
are
hardly
heard
but
they
are
heard
just
so
much
that
men
also
who
are
destined
at
the
end
to
grow
glorious
and
to
die
look
up
and
hear
them
falling
with
what
a
pageantry
of
every
sort
is
not
that
troubling
symbol
surrounded
the
scent
of
life
is
never
fuller
in
the
woods
than
now
for
the
ground
is
yielding
up
its
memories
the
spring
when
it
comes
will
not
restore
this
fullness
nor
these
deep
and
ample
recollections
of
the
earth
for
the
earth
seems
now
to
remember
the
drive
of
the
ploughshare
and
its
harrying
the
seed
and
the
full
bursting
of
it
the
swelling
and
the
completion
of
the
harvest
up
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
throughout
the
weald
the
earth
has
borne
fruit
the
barns
are
full
and
the
wheat
is
standing
stacked
in
the
fields
and
there
are
orchards
all
around
it
is
upon
such
a
mood
of
parentage
and
of
fruition
that
the
dead
leaves
fall
the
colour
is
not
a
mere
splendour
it
is
intricate
the
same
unbounded
power
never
at
fault
and
never
in
calculation
which
comprehends
all
the
landscape
and
which
has
made
the
woods
has
worked
in
each
one
separate
leaf
as
well
they
are
inconceivably
varied
take
up
one
leaf
and
see
how
many
kinds
of
boundary
are
there
here
between
the
stain
which
ends
in
a
sharp
edge
against
the
gold
and
the
sweep
in
which
the
purple
and
red
mingle
more
evenly
than
they
do
in
or
in
flames
nor
are
the
boundaries
to
be
measured
only
by
degrees
of
definition
they
have
also
their
characters
of
line
here
in
this
leaf
are
boundaries
intermittent
boundaries
rugged
boundaries
curved
and
boundaries
broken
nor
do
shape
and
definition
ever
begin
to
exhaust
the
list
for
there
are
softness
and
hardness
too
the
agreement
and
disagreement
with
the
scheme
of
veins
the
grotesque
and
the
simple
in
line
the
sharp
and
the
broad
the
smooth
and
raised
in
boundaries
so
in
this
one
matter
of
boundaries
might
you
discover
for
ever
new
things
there
is
no
end
to
them
their
qualities
are
infinite
and
beside
boundaries
you
have
hues
and
tints
shades
also
varying
thicknesses
of
stuff
and
endless
choice
of
surface
that
list
also
is
infinite
and
the
divisions
of
each
item
in
it
are
infinite
nor
is
it
of
any
use
to
analyse
the
thing
for
everywhere
the
depth
and
the
meaning
of
so
much
creation
are
beyond
our
powers
and
all
this
is
true
of
but
one
dead
leaf
and
yet
every
dead
leaf
will
differ
from
its
fellow
that
which
has
delighted
to
excel
in
boundlessness
within
the
bounds
of
this
one
leaf
has
also
transformed
the
whole
forest
there
is
no
number
to
the
particular
colour
of
the
one
leaf
the
forest
is
like
a
thing
so
changeful
of
its
nature
that
change
clings
to
it
as
a
quality
apparent
even
during
the
glance
of
a
moment
this
forest
makes
a
picture
which
is
designed
but
not
seizable
it
is
a
scheme
but
a
scheme
you
can
not
set
down
it
is
of
those
things
which
can
best
be
retained
by
mere
copying
with
a
pencil
or
a
brush
it
is
of
those
things
which
a
man
can
not
fully
receive
and
which
he
can
not
fully
to
other
men
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
at
this
peculiar
time
this
week
or
moment
of
the
year
the
desires
which
if
they
do
not
prove
at
least
demand
perhaps
remember
our
destiny
come
strongest
they
are
proper
to
the
time
of
autumn
and
all
men
feel
them
the
air
is
at
once
new
and
old
the
morning
if
one
rises
early
enough
to
welcome
its
leisurely
advance
contains
something
in
it
of
profound
reminiscence
the
evenings
hardly
yet
suggest
as
they
soon
will
friends
and
security
and
the
fires
of
home
the
thoughts
awakened
in
us
by
their
bands
of
light
fading
along
the
downs
are
thoughts
which
go
with
loneliness
and
prepare
me
for
the
isolation
of
the
soul
it
is
on
this
account
that
tradition
has
set
at
the
entering
of
autumn
for
a
watch
at
the
gate
of
the
season
the
archangel
and
at
its
close
the
day
and
the
night
of
on
which
the
dead
return
the
good
woman
upon
a
hill
that
overlooks
a
western
plain
and
is
conspicuous
at
the
approach
of
evening
there
still
stands
a
house
of
faded
brick
faced
with
cornerings
of
stone
it
is
quite
empty
but
yet
not
deserted
in
each
room
some
little
furniture
remains
all
the
pictures
are
upon
the
walls
the
deep
red
damask
of
the
panels
is
not
faded
or
if
faded
shows
no
contrast
of
brighter
patches
for
nothing
has
been
removed
from
the
walls
here
it
is
possible
to
linger
for
many
hours
alone
and
to
watch
the
slope
of
the
hill
under
the
level
light
as
the
sun
descends
here
passes
a
woman
of
such
nobility
that
though
she
is
dead
the
landscape
and
the
vines
are
hers
it
was
in
september
during
a
silence
of
the
air
that
i
first
saw
her
as
she
moved
among
her
possessions
she
was
smiling
to
herself
as
though
at
a
memory
but
her
smile
was
so
slight
and
so
dignified
so
genial
and
yet
so
restrained
that
you
would
have
thought
it
part
of
everything
around
and
married
as
she
was
to
the
land
which
was
now
her
own
she
wandered
down
the
garden
paths
ruling
the
flowers
upon
either
side
and
receiving
as
she
went
autumn
and
the
fruition
of
her
fields
plenitude
and
completion
surrounded
her
the
benediction
of
almighty
god
must
have
been
upon
her
for
she
was
the
fulfilment
of
her
world
three
fountains
played
in
that
garden
two
next
to
the
northern
and
the
southern
walls
were
small
and
low
they
rather
flowed
than
rose
two
cones
of
marble
received
their
fall
and
over
these
they
spread
in
an
even
sheet
with
little
noise
making
as
it
were
a
sheath
of
water
which
covered
all
the
stone
but
the
third
sprang
into
the
air
with
delicate
triumph
fine
and
high
satisfied
tenuous
and
exultant
this
one
tossed
its
summit
into
the
light
and
alone
of
the
things
in
the
garden
the
plash
of
its
waters
recalled
and
suggested
activity
though
that
in
so
discreet
a
way
that
it
was
to
be
heard
rather
than
regarded
the
birds
flew
off
in
circles
over
the
roofs
of
the
town
below
us
very
soon
they
went
to
their
rest
the
slow
transfiguration
of
the
light
by
which
the
air
became
full
of
colours
and
every
outline
merged
into
the
evening
made
of
all
i
saw
as
i
came
up
towards
her
a
soft
and
united
vision
wherein
her
advancing
figure
stood
up
central
and
gave
a
meaning
to
the
whole
i
will
not
swear
that
she
did
not
as
she
came
bestow
as
well
as
receive
an
influence
of
the
sunset
it
was
said
by
the
ancients
that
virtue
is
active
an
agent
and
has
power
to
control
created
things
for
they
said
it
is
in
a
direct
relation
with
whatever
orders
and
has
ordained
the
general
scheme
such
power
perhaps
resided
in
her
hands
it
would
have
awed
me
but
hardly
astonished
if
as
the
twilight
deepened
the
inclination
of
the
stems
had
obeyed
her
gesture
and
she
had
put
the
place
to
sleep
as
i
came
near
i
saw
her
plainly
her
face
was
young
although
she
was
so
wise
but
its
youth
had
the
aspect
of
a
divine
survival
time
adorned
it
music
survives
whatever
is
eternal
in
the
grace
of
simple
airs
or
in
the
christian
innocence
of
mozart
was
apparent
nay
had
increased
in
her
features
as
the
days
in
passing
had
added
to
them
not
only
experience
but
also
revelation
and
security
she
was
serene
the
posture
of
her
head
was
high
and
her
body
which
was
visibly
informed
by
an
immortal
spirit
had
in
its
carriage
a
large
a
regal
an
uplifted
bearing
which
even
now
as
i
write
of
it
after
so
many
years
turns
common
every
other
sight
that
has
encountered
me
this
was
the
way
in
which
i
first
saw
her
upon
her
own
hillside
at
evening
with
every
season
i
returned
and
with
every
season
she
greeted
my
coming
with
a
more
generous
and
a
more
vivacious
air
i
think
the
years
slipped
off
and
did
not
add
themselves
upon
her
mind
the
common
doom
of
mortality
escaped
her
until
perhaps
its
sign
was
imposed
upon
her
hair
for
this
at
last
was
touched
all
through
with
that
appearance
or
gleam
which
might
be
morning
or
which
might
be
snow
she
was
able
to
conjure
all
evil
those
desperate
enemies
of
mankind
which
lie
in
siege
of
us
all
around
grew
feeble
and
were
silent
when
she
came
nor
has
any
other
force
than
hers
dared
to
enter
the
rooms
where
she
had
lived
it
is
her
influence
alone
which
inhabits
them
there
is
a
vessel
of
copper
enamelled
in
green
and
gilded
which
she
gave
with
her
own
hands
to
a
friend
overseas
i
have
twice
touched
it
in
an
evil
hour
strength
sustenance
and
a
sacramental
justice
are
permanent
in
such
lives
and
such
lives
also
attain
before
their
close
to
so
general
a
survey
of
the
world
that
their
appreciations
are
at
once
accurate
and
universal
on
this
account
she
did
not
fail
in
any
human
conversation
nor
was
she
ever
for
a
moment
less
than
herself
but
always
and
throughout
her
moods
her
laughter
was
unexpected
and
full
her
fear
natural
her
indignation
glorious
above
all
her
charity
extended
like
a
breeze
it
enveloped
everything
she
knew
the
sense
of
destiny
faded
from
me
as
the
warmth
of
that
charity
fell
upon
my
soul
the
foreknowledge
of
death
retreated
as
did
every
other
unworthy
panic
she
drew
the
objects
of
her
friendship
into
something
new
they
breathed
an
air
from
another
country
so
that
those
whom
she
deigned
to
regard
were
compared
with
other
men
like
the
living
compared
with
the
dead
or
better
still
they
were
like
men
awake
while
the
rest
were
tortured
by
dreams
and
haunted
of
the
unreal
indeed
she
had
a
word
given
to
her
which
saved
all
the
souls
of
her
acquaintance
it
is
not
true
that
influence
of
this
sort
decays
or
passes
into
vaguer
and
vaguer
depths
of
memory
it
does
not
dissipate
it
is
not
dissolved
it
does
not
only
spread
and
broaden
it
also
increases
with
the
passage
of
time
the
musicians
bequeath
their
spirit
notably
those
who
have
loved
delightful
themes
and
easy
melodies
the
poets
are

but
those
who
resemble
her
do
more
for
they
grow
out
upon

centuries
they
themselves

not

they
are

of
men
she
was
of
this
kind
she
was
certainly
of
this
kind
she
died
upon
this
day
in
the
year
in
these
lines
i
perpetuate
her
memory
footnote
the
of
december
the
harbour
in
the
north
upon
that
shore
of
europe
which
looks
out
towards
no
further
shore
i
came
once
by
accident
upon
a
certain
man
the
day
had
been
warm
and
almost
calm
but
a
little
breeze
from
the
had
all
day
long
given
life
to
the
sea
the
seas
had
run
very
small
and
brilliant
yet
without
violence
before
the
wind
and
had
broken
upon
the
granite
cliffs
to
leeward
not
in
spouts
of
foam
but
in
a
white
even
line
that
was
thin
and
from
which
one
heard
no
sound
of
surge
moreover
as
i
was
running
dead
north
along
the
coast
the
noise
about
the
bows
was
very
slight
and
pleasant
the
regular
and
gentle
wind
came
upon
the
quarter
without
change
and
the
heel
of
the
boat
was
steady
no
calm
came
with
the
late
sunset
the
breeze
still
held
and
so
till
nearly
midnight
i
could
hold
a
course
and
hardly
feel
the
pulling
of
the
helm
meanwhile
the
arch
of
the
sunset
endured
for
i
was
far
to
the
northward
and
all
those
colours
which
belong
to
june
above
the
arctic
sea
shone
and
changed
in
the
slow
progress
of
that
arch
as
it
advanced
before
me
and
mingled
at
last
with
the
dawn
throughout
the
hours
of
that
journey
i
could
see
clearly
the
seams
of
the
deck
forward
the
texture
of
the
canvas
and
the
natural
hues
of
the
woodwork
and
the
rigging
the
glint
of
the
brasswork
and
even
the
letters
painted
round
the
little
so
continually
did
the
light
endure
the
silence
which
properly
belongs
to
darkness
and
which
accompanies
the
sleep
of
birds
upon
the
sea
appeared
to
be
the
more
intense
because
of
such
a
continuance
of
the
light
and
what
with
a
long
vigil
and
new
water
it
was
as
though
i
had
passed
the
edge
of
all
known
maps
and
had
crossed
the
boundary
of
new
land
in
such
a
mood
i
saw
before
me
the
dark
band
of
a
stone
jetty
running
some
miles
off
from
the
shore
into
the
sea
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
fixed
beacon
whose
gleam
showed
against
the
translucent
sky
and
its
broken
reflection
in
the
pale
sea
as
a
candle
shows
when
one
pulls
the
curtains
of
one
room
and
lets
in
the
beginnings
of
the
day
for
this
point
i
ran
and
as
i
turned
it
i
discovered
a
little
harbour
quite
silent
under
the
growing
light
there
was
not
a
man
upon
its
wharves
and
there
was
no
smoke
rising
from
its
slate
roofs
it
was
absolutely
still
the
boat
swung
easily
round
in
the
calm
water
the
slipped
by
the
screen
of
the
beacon
suddenly
cut
off
its
glare
and
she
went
slowly
with
no
air
in
her
canvas
towards
the
patch
of
darkness
under
the
quay
there
as
i
did
not
know
the
place
i
would
not
pick
up
moorings
which
another
man
might
own
and
need
but
as
my
boat
still
crept
along
with
what
was
left
of
her
way
i
let
go
the
little
anchor
for
it
was
within
an
hour
of
low
tide
and
i
was
sure
of
water
when
i
had
done
this
she
soon
tugged
at
the
chain
and
i
slackened
all
the
halyards
i
put
the
cover
on
the
mainsail
and
as
i
did
so
looking
aft
i
noted
the
high
behind
the
town
standing
clear
in
the
dawn
i
turned
eastward
to
receive
it
the
light
still
lifted
and
though
i
had
not
slept
i
could
not
but
stay
up
and
watch
the
glory
growing
over
heaven
it
was
just
then
when
i
had
stowed
everything
away
that
i
heard
to
the
right
of
me
the
crooning
of
a
man
a
few
moments
before
i
should
not
have
seen
him
under
the
darkness
of
the
but
the
light
was
so
largely
advanced
it
was
nearly
two
that
i
now
clearly
made
out
both
his
craft
and
him
she
was
sturdy
and
high
and
i
should
think
of
slight
draught
she
was
of
great
beam
she
carried
but
one
sail
and
that
was
brown
he
had
it
loose
with
the
peak
dipped
ready
for
hoisting
and
he
himself
was
busy
at
some
work
upon
the
floor
stowing
and
fitting
his
bundles
and
as
he
worked
he
crooned
gently
to
himself
it
was
then
that
i
hailed
him
but
in
a
low
voice
so
much
did
the
silence
of
that
place
impress
itself
upon
all
living
beings
who
were
strange
to
it
he
looked
up
and
told
me
that
he
had
not
seen
me
come
in
nor
heard
the
rattling
of
the
chain
i
asked
him
what
he
would
do
so
early
whether
he
was
off
fishing
at
that
hour
or
whether
he
was
taking
parcels
down
the
coast
for
hire
or
goods
to
sell
at
some
other
port
he
answered
me
that
he
was
doing
none
of
those
things
what
cruise
then
are
you
about
to
take
i
said
i
am
off
he
answered
in
a
low
and
happy
voice
to
find
what
is
beyond
the
sea
and
to
what
shore
said
i
do
you
mean
to
sail
he
answered
i
am
out
upon
this
sea
northward
to
where
they
say
there
is
no
further
shore
as
he
spoke
he
looked
towards
that
horizon
which
now
stood
quite
clean
and
clear
between
the
his
eyes
were
full
of
the
broad
daylight
and
he
breathed
the
rising
wind
as
though
it
were
a
promise
of
new
life
and
of
unexpected
things
i
asked
him
then
what
his
security
was
and
had
he
formed
a
plan
and
why
he
was
setting
out
from
this
small
place
unless
perhaps
it
was
his
home
of
which
he
might
be
tired
no
he
answered
and
smiled
this
is
not
my
home
and
i
have
come
to
it
as
you
may
have
come
to
it
for
the
first
time
and
like
you
i
came
in
after
the
whole
place
slept
but
as
i
neared
i
noticed
certain
shore
marks
and
signs
which
had
been
given
me
and
then
i
knew
that
i
had
come
to
the
of
a
long
voyage
of
what
voyage
i
asked
he
answered
this
is
that
harbour
in
the
north
of
which
a
breton
priest
once
told
me
that
i
should
reach
it
and
when
i
had
moored
in
it
and
laid
my
stores
on
board
in
order
i
should
set
sail
before
morning
and
reach
at
last
a
complete
repose
then
he
went
on
with
eagerness
though
still
talking
low
the
voyage
which
i
was
born
to
make
in
the
end
and
to
which
my
desire
has
driven
me
is
towards
a
place
in
which
everything
we
have
known
is
forgotten
except
those
things
which
as
we
knew
them
reminded
us
of
an
original
joy
in
that
place
i
shall
discover
again
such
full
moments
of
content
as
i
have
known
and
i
shall
preserve
them
without
failing
it
is
in
some
country
beyond
this
sea
and
it
has
a
harbour
like
this
harbour
only
set
towards
the
south
as
this
is
towards
the
north
but
like
this
harbour
it
looks
out
over
an
unknown
sea
and
like
this
harbour
it
enjoys
a
perpetual
light
of
what
the
happy
people
in
this
country
are
or
of
how
they
speak
no
one
has
told
me
but
they
will
receive
me
well
for
i
am
of
one
kind
with
themselves
but
as
to
how
i
shall
know
this
harbour
i
can
tell
you
there
is
a
range
of
hills
broken
by
a
valley
through
which
one
sees
a
further
and
a
higher
range
and
steering
for
this
hollow
in
the
hills
one
sees
a
tower
out
to
sea
upon
a
rock
and
high
up
inland
a
white
quarry
on
a
and
these
two
in
line
are
the
leading
marks
by
which
one
gets
clear
into
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
so
to
the
wharves
of
the
town
and
there
he
ended
i
shall
come
off
the
sea
for
ever
and
every
one
will
call
me
by
my
name
the
sun
was
now
near
the
horizon
but
not
yet
risen
and
for
a
little
time
he
said
nothing
to
me
nor
i
to
him
for
he
was
at
work
sweating
up
the
halyard
and
setting
the
peak
he
let
go
the
mooring
knot
also
but
he
held
the
end
of
the
rope
in
his
hand
and
paid
it
out
standing
and
looking
upward
as
the
sail
slowly
filled
and
his
craft
drifted
towards
me
he
pressed
the
tiller
with
his
knee
to
keep
her
full
i
now
knew
by
his
eyes
and
voice
that
he
was
from
the
west
and
i
could
not
see
him
leave
me
without
asking
him
from
what
place
he
came
that
he
should
set
out
for
such
another
place
so
i
asked
him
are
you
from
ireland
or
from
brittany
or
from
the
islands
he
answered
me
i
am
from
none
of
these
but
from
cornwall
and
as
he
answered
me
thus
shortly
he
still
watched
the
sail
and
still
pressed
the
tiller
with
his
knee
and
still
paid
out
the
mooring
rope
without
turning
round
you
can
not
make
the
harbour
i
said
to
him
it
is
not
of
this
world
just
at
that
moment
the
breeze
caught
the
peak
of
his
jolly
brown
sail
he
dropped
the
tail
of
the
rope
it
slipped
and
splashed
into
the
harbour
slime
his
large
boat
heeled
shot
up
just
missed
my
cable
and
then
he
let
her
go
free
and
she
ran
clear
away
as
she
ran
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
laughed
most
cheerily
he
greeted
me
with
his
eyes
and
he
waved
his
hand
to
me
in
the
morning
light
he
held
her
well
a
clean
wake
ran
behind
her
he
put
her
straight
for
the
and
passed
the
and
took
the
sea
outside
whether
in
honest
truth
he
was
a
fisherman
out
for
fishes
who
chose
to
fence
with
me
or
whether
in
that
cruise
of
his
he
landed
up
in
a
norwegian
bay
or
thought
better
of
it
in
orkney
or
went
through
the
sea
and
through
death
to
the
place
he
desired
i
have
never
known
i
watched
him
holding
on
and
certainly
he
kept
a
course
the
sun
rose
the
town
awoke
but
i
would
not
cease
from
watching
him
his
sail
still
showed
a
smaller
and
a
smaller
point
upon
the
sea
he
did
not
waver
for
an
hour
i
caught
it
and
lost
it
and
caught
it
again
as
it
dwindled
for
half
another
hour
i
could
not
swear
to
it
in
the
blaze
before
i
had
wearied
it
was
gone
oh
my
companions
both
you
to
whom
i
dedicate
this
book
and
you
who
have
accompanied
me
over
other
hills
and
across
other
waters
or
before
the
guns
in
burgundy
or
you
others
who
were
with
me
when
i
seemed
alone
that
ulterior
shore
was
the
place
we
were
seeking
in
every
cruise
and
march
and
the
place
we
thought
at
last
to
see
we
too
had
in
mind
that
town
of
which
this
man
spoke
to
me
in
the
scottish
harbour
before
he
sailed
out
northward
to
find
what
he
could
find
but
i
did
not
follow
him
for
even
if
i
had
followed
him
i
should
not
have
found
the
town
