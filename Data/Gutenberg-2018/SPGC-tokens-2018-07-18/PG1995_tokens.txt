it
is
a
happiness
for
me
to
connect
this
volume
with
the
memory
of
my
friend
and
master
from
youth
i
was
but
a
beginner
in
the
study
of
the
divine
comedy
when
i
first
had
his
incomparable
aid
in
the
understanding
of
it
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
read
the
proofs
of
this
volume
to
what
great
advantage
to
my
work
may
readily
be
conceived
when
in
the
early
summer
of
this
year
the
printing
of
the
purgatory
began
though
illness
made
it
an
exertion
to
him
he
continued
this
act
of
friendship
and
did
not
cease
till
at
the
fifth
canto
he
laid
down
the
pencil
forever

his
dear

introduction
so
many
versions
of
the
divine
comedy
exist
in
english
that
a
new
one
might
well
seem
needless
but
most
of
these
translations
are
in
verse
and
the
intellectual
temper
of
our
time
is
impatient
of
a
transmutation
in
which
substance
is
sacrificed
for
form
sake
and
the
new
form
is
itself
different
from
the
original
the
conditions
of
verse
in
different
languages
vary
so
widely
as
to
make
any
versified
translation
of
a
poem
but
an
imperfect
reproduction
of
the
archetype
it
is
like
an
imperfect
mirror
that
renders
but
a
partial
likeness
in
which
essential
features
are
blurred
or
distorted
dante
himself
the
first
modern
critic
declared
that
nothing
harmonized
by
a
musical
bond
can
be
transmuted
from
its
own
speech
without
losing
all
its
sweetness
and
harmony
and
every
fresh
attempt
at
translation
affords
a
new
proof
of
the
truth
of
his
assertion
each
language
exhibits
its
own
special
genius
in
its
poetic
forms
even
when
they
are
closely
similar
in
rhythmical
method
their
poetic
effect
is
essentially
different
their
individuality
is
distinct
the
hexameter
of
the
iliad
is
not
the
hexameter
of
the
aeneid
and
if
this
be
the
case
in
respect
to
related
forms
it
is
even
more
obvious
in
respect
to
forms
peculiar
to
one
language
like
the
terza
rima
of
the
italian
for
which
it
is
impossible
to
find
a
satisfactory
equivalent
in
another
tongue
if
then
the
attempt
be
vain
to
reproduce
the
form
or
to
represent
its
effect
in
a
translation
yet
the
substance
of
a
poem
may
have
such
worth
that
it
deserves
to
be
known
by
readers
who
must
read
it
in
their
own
tongue
or
not
at
all
in
this
case
the
aim
of
the
translator
should
be
to
render
the
substance
fully
exactly
and
with
as
close
a
correspondence
to
the
tone
and
style
of
the
original
as
is
possible
between
prose
and
poetry
of
the
charm
of
the
power
of
the
poem
such
a
translation
can
give
but
an
inadequate
suggestion
the
musical
bond
was
of
its
essence
and
the
loss
of
the
musical
bond
is
the
loss
of
the
beauty
to
which
form
and
substance
mutually
contributed
and
in
which
they
were
both
alike
harmonized
and
sublimated
the
rhythmic
life
of
the
original
is
its
vital
spirit
and
the
translation
losing
this
vital
spirit
is
at
best
as
the
dull
plaster
cast
to
the
living
marble
or
the
breathing
bronze
the
intellectual
substance
is
there
and
if
the
work
be
good
something
of
the
emotional
quality
may
be
conveyed
the
imagination
may
mould
the
prose
as
it
moulded
the
verse
but
after
all
translations
are
but
as
things
at
best
as
howell
said
in
one
of
his
familiar
letters
no
poem
in
any
tongue
is
more
informed
with
rhythmic
life
than
the
divine
comedy
and
yet
such
is
its
extraordinary
distinction
no
poem
has
an
intellectual
and
emotional
substance
more
independent
of
its
metrical
form
its
complex
structure
its
elaborate
measure
and
rhyme
highly
artificial
as
they
are
are
so
mastered
by
the
genius
of
the
poet
as
to
become
the
most
natural
expression
of
the
spirit
by
which
the
poem
is
inspired
while
at
the
same
time
the
thought
and
sentiment
embodied
in
the
verse
is
of
such
import
and
the
narrative
of
such
interest
that
they
do
not
lose
their
worth
when
expressed
in
the
prose
of
another
tongue
they
still
have
power
to
quicken
imagination
and
to
evoke
sympathy
in
english
there
is
an
excellent
prose
translation
of
the
inferno
by
john
carlyle
a
man
well
known
to
the
reader
of
his
brother
correspondence
it
was
published
forty
years
ago
but
it
is
still
contemporaneous
enough
in
style
to
answer
every
need
and
had
carlyle
made
a
version
of
the
whole
poem
i
should
hardly
have
cared
to
attempt
a
new
one
in
my
translation
of
the
inferno
i
am
often
carlyle
debtor
his
conception
of
what
a
translation
should
be
is
very
much
the
same
as
my
own
of
the
purgatorio
there
is
a
prose
version
which
has
excellent
qualities
by
dugdale
another
version
of
great
merit
of
both
the
purgatorio
and
paradiso
is
that
of
butler
it
is
accompanied
by
a
scholarly
and
valuable
comment
and
i
owe
much
to
butler
work
but
through
what
seems
to
me
occasional
excess
of
literal
fidelity
his
english
is
now
and
then
somewhat
crabbed
he
overacts
the
office
of
an
interpreter
i
cite
again
from
howell
who
doth
enslave
himself
too
strictly
to
words
or
phrases
one
may
be
so
in
words
that
he
may
mar
the
matter
i
have
tried
to
be
as
literal
in
my
translation
as
was
consistent
with
good
english
and
to
render
dante
own
words
in
words
as
nearly
correspondent
to
them
as
the
difference
in
the
languages
would
permit
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
familiar
uses
and
subtle
associations
which
give
to
words
their
full
meaning
are
never
absolutely
the
same
in
two
languages
love
in
english
not
only
sounds
but
is
different
from
amor
in
latin
or
amore
in
italian
even
the
most
felicitous
prose
translation
must
fail
therefore
at
times
to
afford
the
entire
and
precise
meaning
of
the
original
moreover
there
are
difficulties
in
dante
poem
for
italians
and
there
are
difficulties
in
the
translation
for
english
readers
these
where
it
seemed
needful
i
have
endeavored
to
explain
in
brief
footnotes
but
i
have
desired
to
avoid
distracting
the
attention
of
the
reader
from
the
narrative
and
have
mainly
left
the
understanding
of
it
to
his
good
sense
and
perspicacity
the
clearness
of
dante
imaginative
vision
is
so
complete
and
the
character
of
his
narration
of
it
so
direct
and
simple
that
the
difficulties
in
understanding
his
intention
are
comparatively
few
it
is
a
noticeable
fact
that
in
by
far
the
greater
number
of
passages
where
a
doubt
in
regard
to
the
interpretation
exists
the
obscurity
lies
in
the
for
with
all
the
abundant
resources
of
the
italian
tongue
in
rhyme
and
with
all
mastery
of
them
the
truth
still
is
that
his
triple
rhyme
often
compelled
him
to
exact
from
words
such
service
as
they
did
not
naturally
render
and
as
no
other
poet
had
required
of
them
the
compiler
of
the
ottimo
commento
records
in
an
passage
that
i
the
writer
heard
dante
say
that
never
a
rhyme
had
led
him
to
say
other
than
he
would
but
that
many
a
time
and
oft
he
had
made
words
say
for
him
what
they
were
not
wont
to
express
for
other
poets
the
sentence
has
a
double
truth
for
it
indicates
not
only
dante
incomparable
power
to
compel
words
to
give
out
their
full
meaning
but
also
his
invention
of
new
uses
for
them
his
employment
of
them
in
unusual
significations
or
in
forms
hardly
elsewhere
to
be
found
these
devices
occasionally
interfere
with
the
limpid
flow
of
his
diction
but
the
difficulties
of
interpretation
to
which
they
give
rise
serve
rather
to
mark
the
prevailing
clearness
and
simplicity
of
his
expression
than
seriously
to
impede
its
easy
and
unperplexed
current
there
are
few
sentences
in
the
divina
commedia
in
which
a
difficulty
is
occasioned
by
lack
of
definiteness
of
thought
or
distinctness
of
image
a
far
and
more
pervading
source
of
imperfect
comprehension
of
the
poem
than
any
verbal
difficulty
exists
in
the
double
or
triple
meaning
that
runs
through
it
the
narrative
of
the
poet
spiritual
journey
is
so
vivid
and
consistent
that
it
has
all
the
reality
of
an
account
of
an
actual
experience
but
within
and
beneath
runs
a
stream
of
allegory
not
less
consistent
and
hardly
less
continuous
than
the
narrative
itself
to
the
illustration
and
carrying
out
of
this
interior
meaning
even
the
minutest
details
of
external
incident
are
made
to
contribute
with
an
appropriateness
of
significance
and
with
a
freedom
from
forced
interpretation
or
artificiality
of
construction
such
as
no
other
writer
of
allegory
has
succeeded
in
attaining
the
poem
may
be
read
with
interest
as
a
record
of
experience
without
attention
to
its
inner
meaning
but
its
full
interest
is
only
felt
when
this
inner
meaning
is
traced
and
the
moral
significance
of
the
incidents
of
the
story
apprehended
by
the
alert
intelligence
the
allegory
is
the
soul
of
the
poem
but
like
the
soul
within
the
body
it
does
not
show
itself
in
independent
existence
it
is
in
scholastic
phrase
the
form
of
the
body
giving
to
it
its
special
individuality
thus
in
order
truly
to
understand
and
rightly
appreciate
the
poem
the
reader
must
follow
its
course
with
a
double
intelligence
taken
literally
as
dante
declares
in
his
letter
to
can
grande
the
subject
is
the
state
of
the
soul
after
death
simply
considered
but
allegorically
taken
its
subject
is
man
according
as
by
his
good
or
ill
deserts
he
renders
himself
liable
to
the
reward
or
punishment
of
justice
it
is
the
allegory
of
human
life
and
not
of
human
life
as
an
abstraction
but
of
the
individual
life
and
herein
as
lowell
whose
phrase
i
borrow
has
said
lie
its
profound
meaning
and
its
permanent
force
and
herein
too
lie
its
perennial
freshness
of
interest
and
the
actuality
which
makes
it
contemporaneous
with
every
successive
generation
the
increase
of
knowledge
the
loss
of
belief
in
doctrines
that
were
fundamental
in
creed
the
changes
in
the
order
of
society
the
new
thoughts
of
the
world
have
not
lessened
the
moral
import
of
the
poem
any
more
than
they
have
lessened
its
excellence
as
a
work
of
art
its
real
substance
is
as
independent
as
its
artistic
beauty
of
science
of
creed
and
of
institutions
human
nature
has
not
changed
the
motives
of
action
are
the
same
though
their
relative
force
and
the
desires
and
ideals
by
which
they
are
inspired
vary
from
generation
to
generation
and
thus
it
is
that
the
moral
judgments
of
life
framed
by
a
great
poet
whose
imagination
penetrates
to
the
core
of
things
and
who
from
his
very
nature
as
poet
conceives
and
sets
forth
the
issues
of
life
not
in
a
treatise
of
abstract
morality
but
by
means
of
sensible
types
and
images
never
lose
interest
and
have
a
perpetual
contemporaneousness
they
deal
with
the
permanent
and
unalterable
elements
of
the
soul
of
man
lowell
essay
on
dante
makes
other
writing
about
the
poet
or
the
poem
seem
ineffectual
and
superfluous
i
must
assume
that
it
will
be
familiar
to
the
readers
of
my
version
at
least
to
those
among
them
who
desire
truly
to
understand
the
divine
comedy
the
scene
of
the
poem
is
the
spiritual
world
of
which
we
are
members
even
while
still
denizens
of
the
world
of
time
in
the
spiritual
world
the
results
of
sin
or
perverted
love
and
of
virtue
or
right
love
in
this
life
of
probation
are
manifest
the
life
to
come
is
but
the
fulfilment
of
the
life
that
now
is
this
is
the
truth
that
dante
sought
to
enforce
the
allegory
in
which
he
cloaked
it
is
of
a
character
that
separates
the
divine
comedy
from
all
other
works
of
similar
intent
in
the
progress
for
example
the
personages
introduced
are
mere
simulacra
of
men
and
women
the
types
of
moral
qualities
or
religious
dispositions
they
are
abstractions
which
the
genius
of
bunyan
fails
to
inform
with
vitality
sufficient
to
kindle
the
imagination
of
the
reader
with
a
sense
of
their
actual
living
and
breathing
existence
but
in
the
divine
comedy
the
personages
are
all
from
real
life
they
are
men
and
women
with
their
natural
passions
and
emotions
and
they
are
undergoing
an
actual
experience
the
allegory
consists
in
making
their
characters
and
their
fates
what
all
human
characters
and
fates
really
are
the
types
and
images
of
spiritual
law
virgil
and
beatrice
whose
nature
as
depicted
in
the
poem
makes
nearest
approach
to
purely
abstract
and
typical
existence
are
always
consistently
presented
as
living
individuals
exalted
indeed
in
wisdom
and
power
but
with
hardly
less
definite
and
concrete
humanity
than
that
of
dante
himself
the
scheme
of
the
created
universe
held
by
the
christians
of
the
middle
ages
was
comparatively
simple
and
so
definite
that
dante
in
accepting
it
in
its
main
features
without
modification
was
provided
with
the
limited
stage
that
was
requisite
for
his
design
and
of
which
the
general
disposition
was
familiar
to
all
his
readers
the
three
spiritual
realms
had
their
local
bounds
marked
out
as
clearly
as
those
of
time
earth
itself
their
cosmography
was
but
an
extension
of
the
largely
hypothetical
geography
of
the
tune
the
earth
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
its
northern
hemisphere
was
the
abode
of
man
at
the
middle
point
of
this
hemisphere
stood
jerusalem
equidistant
from
the
pillars
of
hercules
on
the
west
and
the
ganges
on
the
east
within
the
body
of
this
hemisphere
was
hell
shared
as
a
vast
cone
of
which
the
apex
was
the
centre
of
the
globe
and
here
according
to
dante
was
the
seat
of
lucifer
the
concave
of
hell
had
been
formed
by
his
fall
when
a
portion
of
the
solid
earth
through
fear
of
him
ran
back
to
the
southern
uninhabited
hemisphere
and
formed
there
directly
antipodal
to
jerusalem
the
mountain
of
purgatory
which
rose
from
the
waste
of
waters
that
covered
this
half
of
the
globe
purgatory
was
shaped
as
a
cone
of
similar
dimensions
to
that
of
hell
amid
at
its
summit
was
the
terrestrial
paradise
immediately
surrounding
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
was
the
sphere
of
elemental
fire
around
this
was
the
heaven
of
the
moon
and
encircling
this
in
order
were
the
heavens
of
mercury
venus
the
sun
mars
jove
saturn
the
fixed
stars
and
the
crystalline
or
first
moving
heaven
these
nine
concentric
heavens
revolved
continually
around
the
earth
and
in
proportion
to
their
distance
from
it
was
time
greater
swiftness
of
each
encircling
all
was
the
empyrean
increate
incorporeal
motionless
unbounded
in
time
or
space
the
proper
seat
of
god
the
home
of
the
angels
the
abode
of
the
elect
the
angelic
hierarchy
consisted
of
nine
orders
corresponding
to
the
nine
moving
heavens
their
blessedness
and
the
swiftness
of
time
motion
with
which
in
unending
delight
they
circled
around
god
were
in
proportion
to
their
nearness
to
him
first
the
seraphs
then
the
cherubs
thrones
dominations
virtues
powers
princes
archangels
and
angels
through
them
under
the
general
name
of
intelligences
the
divine
influence
was
transmitted
to
the
heavens
giving
to
them
their
circular
motion
which
was
the
expression
of
their
longing
to
be
united
with
the
source
of
their
creation
the
heavens
in
their
turn
streamed
down
upon
the
earth
the
divine
influence
thus
distributed
among
them
in
varying
proportion
and
power
producing
divers
effects
in
the
generation
and
corruption
of
material
things
and
in
the
dispositions
and
the
lives
of
men
such
was
the
general
scheme
of
the
universe
the
intention
of
god
in
its
creation
was
to
communicate
of
his
own
perfection
to
the
creatures
endowed
with
souls
that
is
to
men
and
to
angels
and
the
proper
end
of
every
such
creature
was
to
seek
its
own
perfection
in
likeness
to
the
divine
this
end
was
attained
through
that
knowledge
of
god
of
which
the
soul
was
capable
and
through
love
which
was
in
proportion
to
knowledge
virtue
depended
on
the
free
will
of
man
it
was
the
good
use
of
that
will
directed
to
a
right
object
of
love
two
lights
were
given
to
the
soul
for
guidance
of
the
will
the
light
of
reason
for
natural
things
and
for
the
direction
of
the
will
to
moral
virtue
the
light
of
grace
for
things
supernatural
and
for
the
direction
of
the
will
to
spiritual
virtue
sin
was
the
opposite
of
virtue
the
choice
by
the
will
of
false
objects
of
love
it
involved
the
misuse
of
reason
and
the
absence
of
grace
as
the
end
of
virtue
was
blessedness
so
the
end
of
sin
was
misery
the
cornerstone
of
dante
moral
system
was
the
freedom
of
the
will
in
other
words
the
right
of
private
judgment
with
the
condition
of
accountability
this
is
the
liberty
which
dante
that
is
man
goes
seeking
in
his
journey
through
the
spiritual
world
this
liberty
is
to
be
attained
through
the
right
use
of
reason
illuminated
by
divine
grace
it
consists
in
the
perfect
accord
of
the
will
of
man
with
the
will
of
god
with
this
view
of
the
nature
and
end
of
man
dante
conception
of
the
history
of
the
race
could
not
be
other
than
that
its
course
was
providentially
ordered
the
fall
of
man
had
made
him
a
just
object
of
the
vengeance
of
god
but
the
elect
were
to
be
redeemed
and
for
their
redemption
the
history
of
the
world
from
the
beginning
was
directed
not
only
in
his
dealings
with
the
jews
but
in
his
dealings
with
the
heathen
was
god
preparing
for
the
reconciliation
of
man
to
be
finally
accomplished
in
his
sacrifice
of
himself
for
them
the
roman
empire
was
foreordained
and
established
for
this
end
it
was
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
establishment
of
the
roman
church
it
was
the
appointed
instrument
for
the
political
government
of
men
empire
and
church
were
alike
divine
institutions
for
the
guidance
of
man
on
earth
the
aim
of
dante
in
the
divine
comedy
was
to
set
forth
these
truths
in
such
wise
as
to
affect
the
imaginations
and
touch
the
hearts
of
men
so
that
they
should
turn
to
righteousness
his
conviction
of
these
truths
was
no
mere
matter
of
belief
it
had
the
ardor
and
certainty
of
faith
they
had
appeared
to
him
in
all
their
fulness
as
a
revelation
of
the
divine
wisdom
it
was
his
work
as
poet
as
poet
with
a
divine
commission
to
make
this
revelation
known
his
work
was
a
work
of
faith
it
was
sacred
to
it
both
heaven
and
earth
had
set
their
hands
to
this
work
as
i
have
said
the
definiteness
and
the
limits
of
the
generally
accepted
theory
of
the
universe
gave
the
required
frame
the
very
narrowness
of
this
scheme
made
dante
design
practicable
he
had
had
the
experience
of
a
man
on
earth
he
had
been
lured
by
false
objects
of
desire
from
the
pursuit
of
the
true
good
but
divine
grace
in
the
form
of
beatrice
who
had
of
old
on
earth
led
him
aright
now
intervened
and
sent
to
his
aid
virgil
who
as
the
type
of
human
reason
should
bring
him
safe
through
hell
showing
to
him
the
eternal
consequences
of
sin
and
then
should
conduct
him
penitent
up
the
height
of
purgatory
till
on
its
summit
in
the
earthly
paradise
beatrice
should
appear
once
more
to
him
thence
she
as
the
type
of
that
knowledge
through
which
comes
the
love
of
god
should
lead
him
through
the
heavens
up
to
the
empyrean
to
the
consummation
of
his
course

the
actual
vision

especially
those
of
boccaccio
of

of

are
indispensable
to
one
who
would
understand
the
poem
as
it
was
understood
by
dante
immediate
contemporaries
and
successors
it
is
from
them
and
from
the
chronicle
of
dante
contemporary
and
giovanni
villani
that
our
knowledge
concerning
many
of
the
personages
mentioned
in
the
poem
is
derived
in
respect
to
the
theology
and
general
doctrine
of
the
poem
the
summa
theologica
of
thomas
aquinas
is
the
main
source
from
which
dante
himself
drew

either

who
proposes
to

into
the

midway
upon
the
road
of
our

i
found
myself
within
a
dark
wood
for
the
right
way
had
been
missed
ah
how
hard
a
thing
it
is
to
tell
what
this
wild
and
rough
and
dense
wood
was
which
in
thought
renews
the
fear
so
bitter
is
it
that
death
is
little
more
but
in
order
to
treat
of
the
good
that
there
i
found
i
will
tell
of
the
other
things
that
i
have
seen
there
i
can
not
well
recount
how
i
entered
it
so
full
was
i
of
slumber
at
that
point
where
i
abandoned
the
true
way
but
after
i
had
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
where
that
valley
ended
which
had
pierced
my
heart
with
fear
i
looked
on
high
and
saw
its
shoulders
clothed
already
with
the
rays
of
the
planet
that
leadeth
men
aright
along
every
path
then
was
the
fear
a
little
quieted
which
in
the
lake
of
my
heart
had
lasted
through
the
night
that
i
passed
so
piteously
and
even
as
one
who
with
spent
breath
issued
out
of
the
sea
upon
the
shore
turns
to
the
perilous
water
and
gazes
so
did
my
soul
which
still
was
flying
turn
back
to
look
again
upon
the
pass
which
never
had
a
living
person
left
the
sun
a
planet
according
to
the
ptolemaic
system
after
i
had
rested
a
little
my
weary
body
i
took
my
way
again
along
the
desert
slope
so
that
the
firm
foot
was
always
the
lower
and
lo
almost
at
the
beginning
of
the
steep
a
light
and
very
nimble
which
was
covered
with
a
spotted
coat
and
she
did
not
move
from
before
my
face
nay
rather
hindered
so
my
road
that
to
return
i
oftentimes
had
turned
the
time
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
morning
and
the
sun
was
mounting
upward
with
those
stars
that
were
with
him
when
love
divine
first
set
in
motion
those
beautiful
things
so
that
the
hour
of
the
time
and
the
sweet
season
were
occasion
of
good
hope
to
me
concerning
that
wild
beast
with
the
dappled
skin
but
not
so
that
the
sight
which
appeared
to
me
of
a
lion
did
not
give
me
fear
he
seemed
to
be
coming
against
me
with
head
high
and
with
ravening
hunger
so
that
it
seemed
that
the
air
was
affrighted
at
him
and
a
who
with
all
cravings
seemed
laden
in
her
meagreness
and
already
had
made
many
folk
to
live
forlorn
she
caused
me
so
much
heaviness
with
the
fear
that
came
from
sight
of
her
that
i
lost
hope
of
the
height
and
such
as
he
is
who
gaineth
willingly
and
the
time
arrives
that
makes
him
lose
who
in
all
his
thoughts
weeps
and
is
sad
such
made
me
the
beast
without
repose
that
coming
on
against
me
little
by
little
was
pushing
me
back
thither
where
the
sun
is
silent
according
to
old
tradition
the
spring
was
the
season
of
the
creation
these
three
beasts
correspond
to
the
triple
division
of
sins
into
those
of
incontinence
of
violence
and
of
fraud

i
was
falling
back
to

low
place

who
through
long
silence
seemed

when
i
saw
him
in
the
great
desert
have
pity
on

i
cried
to
him

may
the

avail
me

which
have
made
me

thou
art

he
saw
me
weeping
if
thou
wishest
to
escape
from
this
savage
place
for
this
beast
because
of
which
thou
criest
out
lets
not
any
one
pass
along
her
way
but
so
hinders
him
that
she
kills
him
and
she
has
a
nature
so
malign
and
evil
that
she
never
sates
her
greedy
will
and
after
food
is
hungrier
than
before
many
are
the
animals
with
which
she
wives
and
there
shall
be
more
yet
till
the
hound
shall
come
that
will
make
her
die
of
grief
he
shall
not
feed
on
land
or
goods
but
wisdom
and
love
and
valor
and
his
birthplace
shall
be
between
feltro
and
feltro
of
that
humble
italy
shall
he
be
the
salvation
for
which
the
virgin
camilla
died

shall
hunt
her
through

town
till
he
shall
have
set
her
back
in
hell
there
whence
envy
first
sent
her
forth
wherefore
i
think
and
deem
it
for
thy
best
that
thou
follow
me
and
i
will
be
thy
guide
and
will
lead
thee
hence
through
the
eternal
place
where
thou
shalt
hear
the
despairing
shrieks
shalt

then
thou
shalt

those
who
are

fire
because
they
hope
to
come
whenever
it
may
be

the
blessed
folk
to
whom
if
thou
wilt
thereafter
ascend
then
shall
be

thou

i
may
escape
this
ill
and
worse
that
thou

me
thither

now

said

that
i
may
see
the
gate
of

those
whom
thou
makest

the

to
whom
dante
looked
for
the
deliverance
of
italy
from
the
discorda

misrule
that
made
her
wretched

still
matter

the
day
was
going
and
the
dusky
air
was
taking
the
living
things
that
are
on
earth
from
their
fatigues
and
i
alone
was
preparing
to
sustain
the
war
alike
of
the
road
and
of
the
woe
which
the
mind
that
erreth
not

retrace

o

genius
now
assist
me
o

that
didst
inscribe
that
which
i

here
shall
thy
nobility
appear
i
began
poet
that
guidest
me
consider
my
virtue
if
it
is
sufficient
ere
to
the
deep
pass
thou
trustest
me
thou
sayest
that
the
parent
of
silvius
while
still
corruptible
went
to
the
immortal
world
and
was
there
in
the
body
wherefore
if
the
adversary
of
every
ill
was
then
courteous
thinking
on
the
high
effect
that
should
proceed
from
him
and
on
the
who
and
the
what
it
seemeth
not
unmeet
to
the
man
of
understanding
for
in
the
empyreal
heaven
he
had
been
chosen
for
father
of
revered
rome
and
of
her
empire
both
which
to
say
truth
indeed
were
ordained
for
the
holy
place
where
the
successor
of
the
greater
peter
hath
his
seat
through
this
going
whereof
thou
givest
him
vaunt
he
learned
things
which
were
the
cause
of
his
victory
and
of
the
papal
mantle
afterward
the
chosen
vessel
went
thither
to
bring
thence
comfort
to
that
faith
which
is
the
beginning
of
the
way
of
salvation
but
i
why
go
i
thither
or
who
concedes
it
i
am
not
aeneas
i
am
not
paul
me
worthy
of
this
neither
i
nor
others
think
wherefore
if
i
give
myself
up
to
go
i
fear
lest
the
going
may
be
mad
thou
art
wise
thou
understandest
better
than
i
speak
who
he
was
and
what
should
result
and
as
is
he
who
unwills
what
he
willed
and
because
of
new
thoughts
changes
his
design
so
that
he
quite
withdraws
from
beginning
such
i
became
on
that
dark
hillside
wherefore
in
my
thought
i
abandoned
the
enterprise
which
had
been
so
hasty
in
the
beginning
if
i
have
rightly
understood
thy
speech
replied
that
shade
of
the
magnanimous
one
thy
soul
is
hurt
by
cowardice
which
oftentimes
encumbereth
a
man
so
that
it
turns
him
back
from
honorable
enterprise
as
false
seeing
does
a
beast
when
it
is
startled
in
order
that
thou
loose
thee
from
this
fear
i
will
tell
thee
wherefore
i
have
come
and
what
i
heard
at
the
first
moment
that
i
grieved
for
thee
i
was
among
those
who
are
suspended
and
a
lady
called
me
so
blessed
and
beautiful
that
i
besought
her
to
command
her
eyes
were
more
lucent
than
the
star
and
she
began
to
speak
to
me
sweet
and
low
with
angelic
voice
in
her
own
tongue
courteous
mantuan
soul
of
whom
the
fame
yet
lasteth
in
the
world
and
shall
last
so
long
as
the
world
endureth
a
friend
of
mine
and
not
of
fortune
upon
the
desert
hillside
is
so
hindered
on
his
road
that
he
has
turned
for
fear
and
i
am
afraid
through
that
which
i
have
heard
of
him
in
heaven
lest
already
he
be
so
astray
that
i
may
have
risen
late
to
his
succor
now
do
thou
move
and
with
thy
speech
ornate
and
with
whatever
is
needful
for
his
deliverance
assist
him
so
that
i
may
be
consoled
for
him
i
am
beatrice
who
make
thee
go
i
come
from
a
place
whither
i
desire
to
return
love
moved
me
and
makes
me
speak
when
i
shall
be
before
my
lord
i
will
commend
thee
often
unto
him
then
she
was
silent
and
thereon
i
began
lady
of
virtue
thou
alone
through
whom
the
human
race
surpasseth
all
contained
within
that
heaven
which
hath
the
smallest
circles
so
pleasing
unto
me
is
thy
command
that
to
obey
it
were
it
already
done
were
slow
to
me
thou
hast
no
need
further
to
open
unto
me
thy
will
but
tell
me
the
cause
why
thou
guardest
not
thyself
from
descending
down
here
into
this
centre
from
the
ample
place
whither
thou
burnest
to
return
thou
wishest
to
know
so
inwardly
i
will
tell
thee
briefly
she
replied
to
me
i
fear
not
to
come
here
within
one
ought
to
fear
those
things
only
that
have
power
of
doing
harm
the
others
not
for
they
are
not
dreadful
i
am
made
by
god
thanks
be
to
him
such
that
your
misery
toucheth
me
not
nor
doth
the
flame
of
this
burning
assail
me
a
gentle
lady
is
in
heaven
who
hath
pity
for
this
hindrance
whereto
i
send
thee
so
that
stern
judgment
there
above
she
breaketh
she
summoned
lucia
in
her
request
and
said
thy
faithful
one
now
hath
need
of
thee
and
unto
thee
i
commend
him
lucia
the
foe
of
every
cruel
one
rose
and
came
to
the
place
where
i
was
seated
with
the
ancient
rachel
she
said
beatrice
true
praise
of
god
why
dost
thou
not
succor
him
who
so
loved
thee
that
for
thee
he
came
forth
from
the
vulgar
throng
dost
thou
not
hear
the
pity
of
his
plaint
dost
thou
not
see
the
death
that
combats
him
beside
the
stream
whereof
the
sea
hath
no
vaunt
in
the
world
never
were
persons
swift
to
seek
their
good
and
to
fly
their
harm
as
i
after
these
words
were
uttered
came
here
below
from
my
blessed
seat
putting
my
trust
in
thy
upright
speech
which
honors
thee
and
them
who
have
heard
it
after
she
had
said
this
to
me
weeping
she
turned
her
lucent
eyes
whereby
she
made
me
more
speedy
in
coming
and
i
came
to
thee
as
she
willed
thee
have
i
delivered
from
that
wild
beast
that
took
from
thee
the
short
ascent
of
the
beautiful
mountain
what
is
it
then
why
why
dost
thou
hold
back
why
dost
thou
harbor
such
cowardice
in
thy
heart
why
hast
thou
not
daring
and
boldness
since
three
blessed
ladies
care
for
thee
in
the
court
of
heaven
and
my
speech
pledges
thee
such
good
in
limbo
neither
in
hell
nor
heaven
the
heaven
of
the
moon
nearest
to
the
earth
the
virgin
as
flowerets
bent
and
closed
by
the
chill
of
night
after
the
sun
shines
on
them
straighten
themselves
all
open
on
their
stem
so
i
became
with
my
weak
virtue
and
such
good
daring
hastened
to
my
heart
that
i
began
like
one
enfranchised
oh
compassionate
she
who
succored
me
and
thou
courteous
who
didst
speedily
obey
the
true
words
that
she
addressed
to
thee
thou
by
thy
words
hast
so
disposed
my
heart
with
desire
of
going
that
i
have
returned
unto
my
first
intent
go
on
now
for
one
sole
will
is
in
us
both
thou
leader
thou
lord
and
thou
master
thus
i
said
to
him
and
when
he
had
moved
on
i
entered
along
the
deep
and
savage
road
canto
iii
the
gate
of
virgil
lends
dante
the
punishment
of
the
neither
good
nor
acheron
and
the
sinners
on
its
dante
swoons
through
me
is
the
way
into
the
woeful
city
through
me
is
the
way
into
eternal
woe
through
me
is
the
way
among
the
lost
people
justice
moved
my
lofty
maker
the
divine
power
the
supreme
wisdom
and
the
primal
love
made
me
before
me
were
no
things
created
unless
eternal
and
i
eternal
last
leave
every
hope
ye
who
enter
these
words
of
color
obscure
i
saw
written
at
the
top
of
a
gate
whereat
i
master
their
meaning
is
dire
to
me
and
he
to
me
like
one
who
knew
here
it
behoves
to
leave
every
fear
it
behoves
that
all
cowardice
should
here
be
dead
we
have
come
to
the
place
where
i
have
told
thee
that
thou
shalt
see
the
woeful
people
who
have
lost
the
good
of
the
understanding
and
when
he
had
put
his
hand
on
mine
with
a
glad
countenance
wherefrom
i
took
courage
he
brought
me
within
the
secret
things
here
sighs
laments
and
deep
wailings
were
resounding
though
the
starless
air
wherefore
at
first
i
wept
thereat
strange
tongues
horrible
cries
words
of
woe
accents
of
anger
voices
high
and
hoarse
and
sounds
of
hands
with
them
were
making
a
tumult
which
whirls
forever
in
that
air
dark
without
change
like
the
sand
when
the
whirlwind
breathes
and
i
who
had
my
head
girt
with
horror
said
master
what
is
it
that
i
hear
and
what
folk
are
they
who
seem
in
woe
so
vanquished
and
he
to
me
this
miserable
measure
the
wretched
souls
maintain
of
those
who
lived
without
infamy
and
without
praise
mingled
are
they
with
that
caitiff
choir
of
the
angels
who
were
not
rebels
nor
were
faithful
to
god
but
were
for
themselves
the
heavens
chased
them
out
in
order
to
be
not
less
beautiful
nor
doth
the
depth
of
hell
receive
them
because
the
damned
would
have
some
glory
from
them
and
i
master
what
is
so
grievous
to
them
that
makes
them
lament
so
bitterly
he
answered
i
will
tell
thee
very
briefly
these
have
no
hope
of
death
and
their
blind
life
is
so
debased
that
they
are
envious
of
every
other
lot
fame
of
them
the
world
permitteth
not
to
be
mercy
and
justice
disdain
them
let
us
not
speak
of
them
but
do
thou
look
and
pass
on
and
i
who
was
gazing
saw
a
banner
that
whirling
ran
so
swiftly
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
scorn
all
repose
and
behind
it
came
so
long
a
train
of
folk
that
i
could
never
have
believed
death
had
undone
so
many
after
i
had
distinguished
some
among
them
i
saw
and
knew
the
shade
of
him
who
made
through
cowardice
the
great
refusal
at
once
i
understood
and
was
certain
that
this
was
the
sect
of
the
caitiffs
displeasing
unto
god
and
unto
his
enemies
these
wretches
who
never
were
alive
were
naked
and
much
stung
by
and
by
wasps
that
were
there
these
streaked
their
faces
with
blood
which
mingled
with
tears
was
harvested
at
their
feet
by
loathsome
worms
who
is
intended
by
these
words
is
uncertain
and
when
i
gave
myself
to
looking
onward
i
saw
people
on
the
bank
of
a
great
river
wherefore
i
said
master
now
grant
to
me
that
i
may
know
who
these
are
and
what
rule
makes
them
appear
so
ready
to
pass
over
as
i
discern
through
the
faint
light
and
he
to
me
the
things
will
be
clear
to
thee
when
we
shall
set
our
steps
on
the
sad
marge
of
acheron
then
with
eyes
bashful
and
cast
down
fearing
lest
my
speech
had
been
irksome
to
him
far
as
to
the
river
i
refrained
from
speaking
and
lo
coming
toward
us
in
a
boat
an
old
man
white
with
ancient
hair
crying
woe
to
you
wicked
souls
hope
not
ever
to
see
heaven
i
come
to
carry
you
to
the
other
bank
into
eternal
darkness
to
heat
and
frost
and
thou
who
art
there
living
soul
depart
from
these
that
are
dead
but
when
he
saw
that
i
did
not
depart
he
said
by
another
way
by
other
ports
thou
shalt
come
to
the
shore
not
here
for
passage
it
behoves
that
a
lighter
bark
bear
thee
the
boat
that
bears
the
souls
to
purgatory
charon
recognizes
that
dante
is
not
among
the
damned
and
my
leader
to
him
charon
vex
not
thyself
it
is
thus
willed
there
where
is
power
to
do
that
which
is
willed
and
farther
ask
not
then
the
fleecy
cheeks
were
quiet
of
the
pilot
of
the
livid
marsh
who
round
about
his
eyes
had
wheels
of
flame
but
those
souls
who
were
weary
and
naked
changed
color
and
gnashed
their
teeth
soon
as
they
heard
his
cruel
words
they
blasphemed
god
and
their
parents
the
human
race
the
place
the
time
and
the
seed
of
their
sowing
and
of
their
birth
then
bitterly
weeping
they
drew
back
all
of
them
together
to
the
evil
bank
that
waits
for
every
man
who
fears
not
god
charon
the
demon
with
eyes
of
glowing
coal
beckoning
them
collects
them
all
he
beats
with
his
oar
whoever
lingers
as
in
autumn
the
leaves
fall
off
one
after
the
other
till
the
bough
sees
all
its
spoils
upon
the
earth
in
like
wise
the
evil
seed
of
adam
throw
themselves
from
that
shore
one
by
one
at
signals
as
the
bird
at
his
call
thus
they
go
over
the
dusky
wave
and
before
they
have
landed
on
the
farther
side
already
on
this
a
new
throng
is
gathered
my
son
said
the
courteous
master
those
who
die
in
the
wrath
of
god
all
meet
together
here
from
every
land
and
they
are
eager
to
pass
over
the
stream
for
the
divine
justice
spurs
them
so
that
fear
is
turned
to
desire
this
way
a
good
soul
never
passes
and
therefore
if
charon
snarleth
at
thee
thou
now
mayest
well
know
what
his
speech
signifies
this
ended
the
dark
plain
trembled
so
mightily
that
the
memory
of
the
terror
even
now
bathes
me
with
sweat
the
tearful
land
gave
forth
a
wind
that
flashed
a
vermilion
light
which
vanquished
every
sense
of
mine
and
i
fell
as
a
man
whom
slumber
seizes
canto
iv
the
further
side
of
virgil
leads
dante
into
limbo
the
first
circle
of
hell
containing
the
spirits
of
those
who
lived
virtuously
but
without
greeting
of
virgil
by
his
fellow
they
enter
a
castle
where
are
the
shades
of
ancient
virgil
and
dante
depart
a
heavy
thunder
broke
the
deep
sleep
in
my
head
so
that
i
started
up
like
a
person
who
by
force
is
wakened
and
risen
erect
i
moved
my
rested
eye
round
about
and
looked
fixedly
to
distinguish
the
place
where
i
was
true
it
is
that
i
found
myself
on
the
verge
of
the
valley
of
the
woeful
abyss
that
gathers
in
thunder
of
infinite
wailings
dark
profound
it
was
and
cloudy
so
that
though
i
fixed
my
sight
on
the
bottom
i
did
not
discern
anything
there
now
we
descend
down
here
into
the
blind
world
began
the
poet
all
deadly
pale
i
will
be
first
and
thou
shalt
be
second
and
i
who
had
observed
his
color
said
how
shall
i
come
if
thou
fearest
who
art
wont
to
be
a
comfort
to
my
doubting
and
he
to
me
the
anguish
of
the
folk
who
are
down
here
depicts
upon
my
face
that
pity
which
thou
takest
for
fear
let
us
go
on
for
the
long
way
urges
us
so
he
set
forth
and
so
he
made
me
enter
within
the
first
circle
that
girds
the
abyss
here
so
far
as
could
be
heard
there
was
no
plaint
but
that
of
sighs
which
made
the
eternal
air
to
tremble
this
came
of
the
woe
without
torments
felt
by
the
crowds
which
were
many
and
great
of
infants
and
of
women
and
of
men
the
good
master
to
me
thou
dost
not
ask
what
spirits
are
these
that
thou
seest
now
i
would
have
thee
know
before
thou
goest
farther
that
they
sinned
not
and
if
they
have
merits
it
sufficeth
not
because
they
had
not
baptism
which
is
part
of
the
faith
that
thou
believest
and
if
they
were
before
christianity
they
did
not
duly
worship
god
and
of
such
as
these
am
i
myself
through
such
defects
and
not
through
other
guilt
are
we
lost
and
only
so
far
harmed
that
without
hope
we
live
in
desire
great
woe
seized
me
at
my
heart
when
i
heard
him
because
i
knew
that
people
of
much
worth
were
suspended
in
that
limbo
tell
me
my
master
tell
me
lord
began
i
with
wish
to
be
assured
of
that
faith
which
vanquishes
every
error
did
ever
any
one
who
afterwards
was
blessed
go
out
from
here
either
by
his
own
or
by
another
merit
and
he
who
understood
my
covert
speech
answered
i
was
new
in
this
state
when
i
saw
a
mighty
one
come
hither
crowned
with
sign
of
victory
he
drew
out
hence
the
shade
of
the
first
parent
of
abel
his
son
and
that
of
noah
of
moses
the
and
obedient
abraham
the
patriarch
and
david
the
king
israel
with
his
father
and
with
his
offspring
and
with
rachel
for
whom
he
did
so
much
and
others
many
and
he
made
them
blessed
and
i
would
have
thee
know
that
before
these
human
spirits
were
not
saved
wishing
especially
to
be
assured
in
regard
to
the
descent
of
christ
into
hell
we
ceased
not
going
on
because
he
spoke
but
all
the
while
were
passing
through
the
wood
the
wood
i
mean
of
crowded
spirits
nor
yet
had
our
way
been
long
from
where
i
slept
when
i
saw
a
fire
that
conquered
a
hemisphere
of
darkness
we
were
still
a
little
distant
from
it
yet
not
so
far
that
i
could
not
partially
discern
that
honorable
folk
possessed
that
place
o
thou
that
honorest
both
science
and
art
these
who
are
they
that
have
such
honor
that
from
the
condition
of
the
others
it
sets
them
apart
and
he
to
me
the
honorable
fame
of
them
which
resounds
above
in
thy
life
wins
grace
in
heaven
that
so
advances
them
at
this
a
voice
was
heard
by
me
honor
the
loftiest
poet
his
shade
returns
that
was
departed
when
the
voice
had
ceased
and
was
quiet
i
saw
four
great
shades
coming
to
us
they
had
a
semblance
neither
sad
nor
glad
the
good
master
began
to
say
look
at
him
with
that
sword
in
hand
who
cometh
before
the
three
even
as
lord
he
is
homer
the
sovereign
poet
the
next
who
comes
is
horace
the
satirist
ovid
is
the
third
and
the
last
is
lucan
since
each
shares
with
me
the
name
that
the
single
voice
sounded
they
do
me
honor
and
in
that
do
well
thus
i
saw
assembled
the
fair
school
of
that
lord
of
the
loftiest
song
which
above
the
others
as
an
eagle
flies
after
they
had
discoursed
somewhat
together
they
turned
to
me
with
sign
of
salutation
and
my
master
smiled
thereat
and
far
more
of
honor
yet
they
did
me
for
they
made
me
of
their
band
so
that
i
was
the
sixth
amid
so
much
wit
thus
we
went
on
as
far
as
the
light
speaking
things
concerning
which
silence
is
becoming
even
as
was
speech
there
where
i
was
we
came
to
the
foot
of
a
noble
castle
seven
times
circled
by
high
walls
defended
round
about
by
a
fair
streamlet
this
we
passed
as
if
hard
ground
through
seven
gates
i
entered
with
these
sages
we
came
to
a
meadow
of
fresh
verdure
people
were
there
with
eyes
slow
and
grave
of
great
authority
in
their
looks
they
spake
seldom
and
with
soft
voices
thus
we
drew
apart
on
one
side
into
a
place
open
luminous
and
high
so
that
they
all
could
be
seen
there
opposite
upon
the
green
enamel
were
shown
to
me
the
great
spirits
whom
to
have
seen
i
inwardly
exalt
myself
i
saw
electra
with
many
companions
among
whom
i
knew
both
hector
and
aeneas
caesar
in
armor
with
his
gerfalcon
eyes
i
saw
camilla
and
penthesilea
on
the
other
side
and
i
saw
the
king
latinus
who
was
seated
with
lavinia
his
daughter
i
saw
that
brutus
who
drove
out
tarquin
lucretia
julia
marcia
and
cornelia
and
alone
apart
i
saw
the
saladin
when
i
raised
my
brow
a
little
more
i
saw
the
master
of
those
who
know
seated
amid
the
philosophic
family
all
regard
him
all
do
him
honor
here
i
saw
both
socrates
and
plato
who
before
the
others
stand
nearest
to
him
democritus
who
ascribes
the
world
to
chance
diogenes
anaxagoras
and
thales
empedocles
heraclitus
and
zeno
and
i
saw
the
good
collector
of
the
qualities
dioscorides
i
mean
and
i
saw
orpheus
tully
and
linus
and
moral
seneca
euclid
the
geometer
and
ptolemy
hippocrates
avicenna
galen
and
averrhoes
who
made
the
great
comment
i
can
not
report
of
all
in
full
because
the
long
theme
so
drives
me
that
many
times
speech
comes
short
of
fact
the
company
of
six
is
reduced
to
two
by
another
way
the
wise
guide
leads
me
out
from
the
quiet
into
the
air
that
trembles
and
i
come
into
a
region
where
is
nothing
that
can
give
light
canto
the
second
circle
that
of
carnal
shades
renowned
of
francesca
da
rimini
thus
i
descended
from
the
first
circle
down
into
the
second
which
girdles
less
space
and
so
much
more
woe
that
it
goads
to
wailing
there
abides
minos
horribly
and
snarls
he
examines
the
sins
at
the
entrance
he
judges
and
he
sends
according
as
he
entwines
himself
i
mean
that
when
the
miscreant
spirit
comes
there
before
him
it
confesses
itself
wholly
and
that
discerner
of
sins
sees
what
place
of
hell
is
for
it
he
girdles
himself
with
his
tail
so
many
times
as
the
degrees
he
wills
it
should
be
sent
down
always
before
him
stand
many
of
them
they
go
in
turn
each
to
the
judgment
they
speak
and
hear
and
then
are
whirled
below
o
thou
that
comest
to
the
woeful
inn
said
minos
to
me
when
he
saw
me
leaving
the
act
of
so
great
an
office
beware
how
thou
enterest
and
to
whom
thou
trustest
thyself
let
not
the
amplitude
of
the
entrance
deceive
thee
and
my
leader
to
him
why
then
dost
thou
cry
out
hinder
not
his
fated
going
thus
is
it
willed
there
where
is
power
to
do
that
which
is
willed
and
ask
thou
no
more
now
the
woeful
notes
begin
to
make
themselves
heard
now
am
i
come
where
much
lamentation
smites
me
i
had
come
into
a
place
mute
of
all
light
that
bellows
as
the
sea
does
in
a
tempest
if
it
be
combated
by
opposing
winds
the
infernal
hurricane
that
never
rests
carries
along
the
spirits
in
its
rapine
whirling
and
smiting
it
molests
them
when
they
arrive
before
its
rushing
blast
here
are
shrieks
and
bewailing
and
lamenting
here
they
blaspheme
the
power
divine
i
understood
that
to
such
torment
are
condemned
the
carnal
sinners
who
subject
reason
to
appetite
and
as
their
wings
bear
along
the
starlings
in
the
cold
season
in
a
troop
large
and
full
so
that
blast
the
evil
spirits
hither
thither
down
up
it
carries
them
no
hope
ever
comforts
them
not
of
repose
but
even
of
less
pain
and
as
the
cranes
go
singing
their
lays
making
in
air
a
long
line
of
themselves
so
saw
i
come
uttering
wails
shades
borne
along
by
the
aforesaid
strife
wherefore
i
said
master
who
are
those
folk
whom
the
black
air
so
castigates
the
first
of
these
of
whom
thou
wishest
to
have
knowledge
said
he
to
me
then
was
empress
of
many
tongues
to
the
vice
of
luxury
was
she
so
abandoned
that
lust
she
made
licit
in
her
law
to
take
away
the
blame
she
had
incurred
she
is
semiramis
of
whom
it
is
read
that
she
succeeded
ninus
and
had
been
his
spouse
she
held
the
land
which
the
soldan
rules
that
other
is
she
who
for
love
killed
herself
and
broke
faith
to
the
ashes
of
sichaeus
next
is
cleopatra
the
luxurious
see
helen
for
whom
so
long
a
time
of
ill
revolved
and
see
the
great
achilles
who
at
the
end
fought
with
love
see
paris
tristan
and
more
than
a
thousand
shades
he
showed
me
with
his
finger
and
named
them
whom
love
had
parted
from
our
life
after
i
had
heard
my
teacher
name
the
dames
of
eld
and
the
cavaliers
pity
overcame
me
and
i
was
well
nigh
bewildered
i
began
poet
willingly
would
i
speak
with
those
two
that
go
together
and
seem
to
be
so
light
upon
the
wind
and
he
to
me
thou
shalt
see
when
they
shall
be
nearer
to
us
and
do
thou
then
pray
them
by
that
love
which
leads
them
and
they
will
come
soon
as
the
wind
sways
them
toward
us
i
lifted
my
voice
o
weary
souls
come
speak
to
us
if
one
forbid
it
not
as
doves
called
by
desire
with
wings
open
and
steady
fly
through
the
air
to
their
sweet
nest
borne
by
their
will
these
issued
from
the
troop
where
dido
is
coming
to
us
through
the
malign
air
so
strong
was
the
compassionate
cry
o
living
creature
gracious
and
benign
that
goest
through
the
lurid
air
visiting
us
who
stained
the
world
if
the
king
of
the
universe
were
a
friend
we
would
pray
him
for
thy
peace
since
thou
hast
pity
on
our
perverse
of
what
it
pleaseth
thee
to
hear
and
what
to
speak
we
will
hear
and
we
will
speak
to
you
while
the
wind
as
now
is
hushed
for
us
the
city
where
i
was
born
sits
upon
the
where
the
po
with
its
followers
descends
to
have
peace
love
that
on
gentle
heart
quickly
lays
hold
seized
him
for
the
fair
person
that
was
taken
from
me
and
the
mode
still
hurts
me
love
which
absolves
no
loved
one
from
loving
seized
me
for
the
pleasing
of
him
so
strongly
that
as
thou
seest
it
does
not
even
now
abandon
me
love
brought
us
to
one
death
caina
awaits
him
who
quenched
our
life
these
words
were
borne
to
us
from
them
soon
as
i
had
heard
those
injured
souls
i
bowed
my
face
and
held
it
down
until
the
poet
said
to
me
what
art
thou
thinking
when
i
replied
i
began
alas
how
many
sweet
thoughts
how
great
desire
led
these
unto
the
woeful
pass
then
i
turned
me
again
to
them
and
i
spoke
and
began
francesca
thy
torments
make
me
sad
and
piteous
to
weeping
but
tell
me
at
the
time
of
the
sweet
sighs
by
what
and
how
did
love
concede
to
you
to
know
the
dubious
desires
and
she
to
me
there
is
no
greater
woe
than
in
misery
to
remember
the
happy
time
and
that
thy
teacher
knows
but
if
to
know
the
first
root
of
our
love
thou
hast
so
great
a
longing
i
will
do
like
one
who
weeps
and
tells
we
were
reading
one
day
for
delight
of
lancelot
how
love
constrained
him
we
were
alone
and
without
any
suspicion
many
times
that
reading
made
us
lift
our
eyes
and
took
the
color
from
our
faces
but
only
one
point
was
that
which
overcame
us
when
we
read
of
the
smile
being
kissed
by
such
a
lover
this
one
who
never
from
me
shall
be
divided
kissed
my
mouth
all
trembling
galahaut
was
the
book
and
he
who
wrote
it
that
day
we
read
in
it
no
farther
in
the
romance
it
was
galahaut
that
prevailed
on
guinevere
to
give
a
kiss
to
lancelot
while
one
spirit
said
this
the
other
was
weeping
so
that
through
pity
i
swooned
as
if
i
had
been
dying
and
fell
as
a
dead
body
falls
canto
vi
the
third
circle
that
of
the
ciacco
when
the
mind
returned
which
closed
itself
before
the
pity
of
these
two
kinsfolk
that
had
all
confounded
me
with
sadness
new
torments
and
new
tormented
souls
i
see
around
me
wherever
i
move
and
howsoever
i
turn
and
wherever
i
gaze
i
am
in
the
third
circle
that
of
the
rain
eternal
accursed
cold
and
heavy
its
rule
and
quality
are
never
new
coarse
hail
and
foul
water
and
snow
pour
down
through
the
tenebrous
air
the
earth
that
receives
them
stinks
cerberus
a
beast
cruel
and
monstrous
with
three
throats
barks
doglike
above
the
people
that
are
here
submerged
he
has
vermilion
eyes
and
a
greasy
and
black
beard
and
a
big
belly
and
hands
armed
with
claws
he
tears
the
spirits
flays
them
and
rends
them
the
rain
makes
them
howl
like
dogs
of
one
of
their
sides
they
make
a
screen
for
the
other
the
profane
wretches
often
turn
themselves
when
cerberus
the
great
worm
observed
us
he
opened
his
mouths
and
showed
his
fangs
to
us
not
a
limb
had
he
that
he
kept
quiet
and
my
leader
opened
wide
his
hands
took
some
earth
and
with
full
fists
threw
it
into
the
ravenous
gullets
as
the
dog
that
barking
craves
and
becomes
quiet
when
he
bites
his
food
and
is
intent
and
fights
only
to
devour
it
such
became
those
filthy
faces
of
the
demon
cerberus
who
so
thunders
at
the
souls
that
they
would
fain
be
deaf
we
were
passing
over
the
shades
whom
the
heavy
rain
subdues
and
were
setting
our
feet
upon
their
vain
show
that
seems
a
body
they
all
of
them
lay
upon
the
ground
except
one
who
raised
himself
to
sit
quickly
as
he
saw
us
passing
before
him
o
thou
who
art
led
through
this
hell
he
said
to
me
recognize
me
if
thou
canst
thou
wast
made
before
i
was
unmade
and
i
to
him
the
anguish
which
thou
hast
perchance
withdraws
thee
from
my
memory
so
that
it
seems
not
that
i
ever
saw
thee
but
tell
me
who
thou
art
that
in
a
place
so
woeful
art
set
and
with
such
a
punishment
that
if
any
other
is
greater
none
is
so
displeasing
and
he
to
me
thy
city
which
is
so
full
of
envy
that
already
the
sack
runs
over
held
me
in
it
in
the
serene
life
you
citizens
called
me
ciacco
for
the
damnable
sin
of
gluttony
as
thou
seest
i
am
broken
by
the
rain
and
i
wretched
soul
am
not
alone
for
all
these
endure
like
punishment
for
like
sin
and
more
he
said
not
i
answered
him
ciacco
thy
trouble
so
weighs
upon
me
that
it
invites
me
to
weeping
but
tell
me
if
thou
canst
to
what
will
come
the
citizens
of
the
divided
city
if
any
one
in
it
is
just
and
tell
me
the
reason
why
such
great
discord
has
assailed
it
ciacco
in
popular
speech
signifies
a
hog
and
he
to
me
after
long
contention
they
will
come
to
blood
and
the
savage
party
will
chase
out
the
other
with
great
injury
thereafter
within
three
suns
it
behoves
this
to
fall
and
the
other
to
surmount
through
the
force
of
one
who
even
now
is
tacking
it
will
hold
high
its
front
long
time
keeping
the
other
under
heavy
burdens
however
it
may
lament
and
be
shamed
thereat
two
men
are
just
but
there
they
are
not
heeded
pride
envy
avarice
are
the
three
sparks
that
have
inflamed
their
hearts
here
he
set
end
unto
the
lamentable
sound
this
prophecy
relates
to
the
dissensions
and
violence
of
the
parties
of
the
whites
and
the
blacks
by
which
florence
was
rent
the
savage
party
was
that
of
the
whites
who
were
mainly
ghibellines
the
one
who
even
now
is
tacking
was
the
pope
boniface
who
was
playing
fast
and
loose
with
both
who
the
two
just
men
were
is
unknown
and
i
to
him
still
i
would
that
thou
teach
me
and
that
of
more
speech
thou
make
a
gift
to
me
farinata
and
the
tegghiaio
who
were
so
worthy
jacopo
rusticucci
arrigo
and
the
mosca
and
the
rest
who
set
their
minds
on
tell
me
where
they
are
and
cause
that
i
may
know
them
for
great
desire
constrains
me
to
learn
if
heaven
sweeten
them
or
hell
envenom
and
he
they
are
among
the
blacker
souls
a
different
sin
weighs
them
down
to
the
bottom
if
thou
so
far
descendest
thou
canst
see
them
but
when
thou
shalt
be
in
the
sweet
world
i
pray
thee
that
thou
bring
me
to
the
memory
of
others
more
i
say
not
to
thee
and
more
i
answer
thee
not
his
straight
eyes
he
twisted
then
awry
looked
at
me
a
little
and
then
bent
his
head
and
fell
with
it
level
with
the
other
blind
and
the
leader
said
to
me
he
wakes
no
more
this
side
the
sound
of
the
angelic
trump
when
the
hostile
sovereign
shall
come
each
one
will
find
again
his
dismal
tomb
will
take
again
his
flesh
and
his
shape
will
hear
that
which
through
eternity
reechoes
thus
we
passed
along
with
slow
steps
through
the
foul
mixture
of
the
shades
and
of
the
rain
touching
a
little
on
the
future
life
wherefore
i
said
master
these
torments
will
they
increase
after
the
great
sentence
or
will
they
become
less
or
will
they
be
just
as
burning
and
he
to
me
return
to
thy
science
which
declares
that
the
more
perfect
a
thing
is
the
more
it
feels
the
good
and
so
the
pain
though
this
accursed
people
never
can
attain
to
true
perfection
it
expects
thereafter
to
be
more
than
now
we
took
a
circling
course
along
that
road
speaking
far
more
than
i
repeat
and
came
to
the
point
where
the
descent
is
here
we
found
pluto
the
great
enemy
pluto
appears
here
not
as
hades
the
god
of
the
lower
world
but
in
his
character
as
the
giver
of
wealth
canto
vii
the
fourth
circle
that
of
the
avaricious
and
the
the
the
fifth
circle
that
of
the
wrathful
and
the
sullen
pape
satan
pape
satan
aleppe
began
pluto
with
his
clucking
voice
and
that
gentle
sage
who
knew
everything
said
to
comfort
me
let
not
thy
fear
hurt
thee
for
whatso
power
he
have
shall
not
take
from
thee
the
descent
of
this
rock
then
he
turned
to
that
swollen
lip
and
said
be
silent
accursed
wolf
inwardly
consume
thyself
with
thine
own
rage
not
without
cause
is
this
going
to
the
abyss
it
is
willed
on
high
there
where
michael
did
vengeance
on
the
proud
adultery
as
sails
swollen
by
the
wind
fall
in
a
heap
when
the
mast
snaps
so
fell
to
earth
the
cruel
beast
adultery
in
the
sense
of
infidelity
to
god
thus
we
descended
into
the
fourth
hollow
taking
more
of
the
woeful
bank
that
gathers
in
the
evil
of
the
whole
universe
ah
justice
of
god
who
heapeth
up
so
many
new
travails
and
penalties
as
i
saw
and
why
doth
our
sin
so
waste
us
as
doth
the
wave
yonder
upon
charybdis
which
is
broken
on
that
which
it
encounters
so
it
behoves
that
here
the
people
counterdance
here
saw
i
people
more
than
elsewhere
many
and
from
one
side
and
the
other
with
great
howls
rolling
weights
by
force
of
chest
they
struck
against
each
other
and
then
just
there
each
turned
rolling
backward
crying
why
keepest
thou
and
why
flingest
thou
away
thus
they
turned
through
the
dark
circle
on
either
hand
to
the
opposite
point
still
crying
out
their
opprobrious
verse
then
each
when
he
had
come
through
his
half
circle
wheeled
round
to
the
other
joust
and
i
who
had
my
heart
pierced
through
said
my
master
now
declare
to
me
what
folk
is
this
and
if
all
these
tonsured
ones
on
our
left
were
clerks
and
he
to
me
all
of
these
were
so
asquint
in
mind
in
the
first
life
that
they
made
no
spending
there
with
measure
clearly
enough
their
voices
bay
it
out
when
they
come
to
the
two
points
of
the
circle
where
the
contrary
sin
divides
them
these
were
clerks
who
have
no
hairy
covering
on
their
head
and
popes
and
cardinals
in
whom
avarice
practices
its
excess
and
i
master
among
such
as
these
i
ought
surely
to
recognize
some
who
were
polluted
with
these
evils
and
he
to
me
vain
thought
thou
harborest
the
undiscerning
life
that
made
them
foul
to
all
recognition
now
makes
them
dim
forever
will
they
come
to
the
two
buttings
these
will
rise
from
the
sepulchre
with
closed
fist
and
these
with
shorn
hair
and
have
taken
from
them
the
fair
world
and
set
them
to
this
scuffle
such
as
it
is
i
adorn
not
words
for
it
now
canst
thou
son
see
the
brief
jest
of
the
goods
that
are
committed
unto
fortune
for
which
the
human
race
so
scramble
for
all
the
gold
that
is
beneath
the
moon
or
that
ever
was
of
these
weary
souls
could
not
make
a
single
one
repose
master
said
i
to
him
now
tell
me
further
this
fortune
on
which
thou
touchest
for
me
what
is
it
that
hath
the
goods
of
the
world
so
in
its
clutches
and
he
to
me
o
creatures
foolish
how
great
is
that
ignorance
that
harms
you
i
would
have
thee
now
take
in
my
judgment
of
her
he
whose
wisdom
transcendeth
all
made
the
heavens
and
gave
them
their
guides
so
that
every
part
on
every
part
doth
shine
equally
distributing
the
light
in
like
wise
for
the
splendors
of
the
world
he
ordained
a
general
ministress
and
guide
who
should
ever
and
anon
transfer
the
vain
goods
from
race
to
race
and
from
one
blood
to
another
beyond
the
resistance
of
human
wit
wherefore
one
race
rules
and
the
other
languishes
pursuant
to
her
judgment
which
is
occult
as
the
snake
in
the
grass
your
wisdom
hath
no
withstanding
of
her
she
provides
judges
and
maintains
her
realm
as
theirs
the
other
gods
her
permutations
have
no
truce
necessity
compels
her
to
be
swift
so
often
cometh
he
who
obtains
a
turn
this
is
she
who
is
so
set
upon
the
cross
even
by
those
who
ought
to
give
her
praise
giving
her
blame
amiss
and
ill
report
but
she
is
blessed
and
hears
this
not
with
the
other
primal
creatures
glad
she
turns
her
sphere
and
blessed
she
rejoices
but
now
let
us
descend
to
greater
woe
already
every
star
sinks
that
was
rising
when
i
set
out
and
too
long
stay
is
forbidden
we
crossed
the
circle
to
the
other
bank
above
a
fount
that
boils
and
pours
down
through
a
cleft
that
proceeds
from
it
the
water
was
far
darker
than
perse
and
we
in
company
with
the
dusky
waves
entered
down
through
a
strange
way
a
marsh
it
makes
that
is
named
styx
this
dismal
little
stream
when
it
has
descended
to
the
foot
of
the
malign
gray
slopes
and
i
who
stood
intent
to
gaze
saw
muddy
people
in
that
swamp
all
naked
and
with
look
of
hurt
they
were
smiting
each
other
not
only
with
hands
but
with
head
and
with
chest
and
with
feet
mangling
one
another
piecemeal
with
their
teeth
the
good
master
said
son
now
thou
seest
the
souls
of
those
whom
anger
overcame
and
likewise
i
would
have
thee
believe
for
certain
that
beneath
the
water
are
folk
who
sigh
and
make
this
water
bubble
at
the
surface
as
thine
eye
tells
thee
wherever
it
turns
fixed
in
the
slime
they
say
were
we
in
the
sweet
air
that
by
the
sun
is
gladdened
bearing
within
ourselves
the
sluggish
fume
now
we
are
sullen
in
the
black
mire
this
hymn
they
gurgle
in
their
throats
for
they
can
not
speak
with
entire
words
the
sin
here
punished
is
that
known
to
the
middle
ages
as
acedia
or
accidie
slackness
in
good
works
and
spiritual
gloom
and
despondency
in
the
parson
tale
chaucer
says
envie
and
ire
maken
bitternesse
in
heart
which
bitternesse
is
mother
of
accidie
thus
we
circled
a
great
arc
of
the
foul
fen
between
the
dry
bank
and
the
slough
with
eyes
turned
on
those
who
guzzle
the
mire
we
came
at
length
to
the
foot
of
a
tower
canto
viii
the
fifth
phlegyas
and
his
passage
of
the
filippo
the
city
of
the
demons
refuse
entrance
to
the
poets
i
say
continuing
that
long
before
we
were
at
the
foot
of
the
high
tower
our
eyes
went
upward
to
its
top
because
of
two
flamelets
that
we
saw
set
there
and
another
giving
signal
back
from
so
far
that
hardly
could
the
eye
reach
it
and
i
turned
me
to
the
sea
of
all
wisdom
i
said
this
one
what
says
it
and
what
answers
that
other
fire
and
who
are
they
that
make
it
and
he
to
me
upon
the
foul
waves
already
thou
mayest
discern
that
which
is
expected
if
the
fume
of
the
marsh
hide
it
not
from
thee
bowstring
never
sped
arrow
from
itself
that
ran
so
swift
a
course
through
the
air
as
a
very
little
boat
which
i
saw
coming
through
the
water
toward
us
at
that
instant
under
the
direction
of
a
single
ferryman
who
was
crying
out
art
thou
then
come
fell
soul
phlegyas
phlegyas
this
time
thou
criest
out
in
vain
said
my
lord
longer
thou
shalt
not
have
us
than
only
while
crossing
the
slough
as
one
who
listens
to
some
great
deceit
that
has
been
practiced
on
him
and
then
chafes
at
it
such
became
phlegyas
in
his
stifled
anger
my
leader
descended
into
the
bark
and
then
he
made
me
enter
after
him
and
only
when
i
was
in
did
it
seem
laden
soon
as
my
leader
and
i
were
in
the
boat
the
antique
prow
goes
its
way
cutting
more
of
the
water
than
it
is
wont
with
others
while
we
were
running
through
the
dead
channel
before
me
showed
himself
one
full
of
mud
and
said
who
art
thou
that
comest
before
the
hour
and
i
to
him
if
i
come
i
stay
not
but
thou
who
art
thou
that
art
become
so
foul
he
answered
thou
seest
that
i
am
one
who
weeps
and
i
to
him
with
weeping
and
with
wailing
accursed
spirit
do
thou
remain
for
i
know
thee
although
thou
art
all
filthy
then
he
stretched
to
the
boat
both
his
hands
whereat
the
wary
master
thrust
him
back
saying
begone
there
with
the
other
dogs
then
with
his
arms
he
clasped
my
neck
kissed
my
face
and
said
disdainful
soul
blessed
be
she
who
bore
thee
this
one
was
an
arrogant
person
in
the
world
no
goodness
is
there
that
adorns
his
memory
therefore
is
his
shade
so
furious
here
how
many
now
up
there
are
held
great
kings
who
shall
stand
here
like
swine
in
mire
leaving
of
themselves
horrible
dispraises
and
i
master
i
should
much
like
to
see
him
ducked
in
this
broth
before
we
depart
from
the
lake
and
he
to
me
ere
the
shore
allows
thee
to
see
it
thou
shalt
be
satisfied
it
will
be
fitting
that
thou
enjoy
such
a
desire
after
this
a
little
i
saw
such
rending
of
him
by
the
muddy
folk
that
i
still
praise
god
therefor
and
thank
him
for
it
all
cried
at
filippo
argenti
and
the
raging
florentine
spirit
turned
upon
himself
with
his
teeth
here
we
left
him
so
that
i
tell
no
more
of
him
but
on
my
ears
there
smote
a
wailing
whereat
forward
intent
i
open
wide
my
eye
and
the
good
master
said
now
son
the
city
draws
near
that
is
named
dis
with
its
heavy
citizens
with
its
great
throng
and
i
master
already
in
the
valley
therewithin
i
clearly
discern
its
mosques
vermillion
as
if
issuing
from
fire
and
he
said
to
me
the
eternal
fire
that
blazes
within
them
displays
them
red
as
thou
seest
in
this
nether
hell
we
at
last
arrived
within
the
deep
ditches
that
encompass
that
disconsolate
city
the
walls
seemed
to
me
to
be
of
iron
not
without
first
making
a
great
circuit
did
we
come
to
a
place
where
the
ferryman
loudly
shouted
to
us
out
with
you
here
is
the
entrance
upon
the
gates
i
saw
more
than
a
thousand
of
those
rained
down
from
heaven
who
angrily
were
saying
who
is
this
that
without
death
goes
through
the
realm
of
the
dead
folk
and
my
wise
master
made
a
sign
of
wishing
to
speak
secretly
with
them
then
they
shut
in
a
little
their
great
scorn
and
said
come
thou
alone
and
let
him
be
gone
who
so
boldly
entered
on
this
realm
alone
let
him
return
on
the
mad
path
let
him
try
if
he
can
for
thou
who
hast
escorted
him
through
so
dark
a
region
shalt
remain
here
think
reader
if
i
was
discomforted
at
the
sound
of
the
accursed
words
for
i
did
not
believe
ever
to
return
hither
to
this
world
o
my
dear
leader
who
more
than
seven
times
hast
renewed
assurance
in
me
and
drawn
me
from
deep
peril
that
stood
confronting
me
leave
me
not
said
i
thus
undone
and
if
the
going
farther
onward
be
denied
us
let
us
together
retrace
our
footprints
quickly
and
that
lord
who
had
led
me
thither
said
to
me
fear
not
for
no
one
can
take
from
us
our
onward
way
by
such
an
one
it
is
given
to
us
but
here
await
me
and
comfort
thy
dejected
spirit
and
feed
on
good
hope
for
i
will
not
leave
thee
in
the
nether
world
so
the
sweet
father
goes
away
and
here
abandons
me
and
i
remain
in
suspense
and
yes
and
no
contend
within
my
head
i
could
not
hear
what
he
set
forth
to
them
but
he
had
not
staid
there
long
with
them
when
each
ran
vying
back
within
these
our
adversaries
closed
the
gates
on
the
breast
of
my
lord
who
remained
without
and
returned
to
me
with
slow
steps
he
held
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
his
brow
was
shorn
of
all
hardihood
and
he
said
in
sighs
who
hath
denied
to
me
the
houses
of
woe
and
he
said
to
me
thou
because
i
am
wroth
be
not
dismayed
for
i
shall
win
the
strife
whoever
circle
round
within
for
the
defence
this
their
insolence
is
not
new
for
of
old
they
used
it
at
a
less
secret
gate
which
still
is
found
without
a
bolt
above
it
thou
didst
see
the
dead
inscription
and
already
on
this
side
of
it
descends
the
steep
passing
without
escort
through
the
circles
one
such
that
by
him
the
city
shall
be
opened
to
us
canto
ix
the
city
of
the
three
the
heavenly
the
sixth
circle
that
of
the
heresiarchs
that
color
which
cowardice
painted
outwardly
on
me
when
i
saw
my
guide
turn
back
repressed
more
speedily
his
own
new
color
he
stopped
attentive
like
a
man
that
listens
for
the
eye
could
not
lead
him
far
through
the
black
air
and
through
the
dense
fog
yet
it
must
be
for
us
to
win
the
fight
began
he
unless
such
an
one
offered
herself
to
us
oh
how
slow
it
seems
till
some
one
here
arrive
beatrice
the
messenger
from
heaven
referred
to
in
the
last
verses
of
the
last
canto
i
saw
well
how
he
covered
up
the
beginning
with
the
rest
that
came
after
which
were
words
different
from
the
first
but
nevertheless
his
speech
gave
me
fear
because
i
drew
his
broken
phrase
perchance
to
a
worse
meaning
than
it
held
into
this
depth
of
the
dismal
shell
does
any
one
ever
descend
from
the
first
grade
who
has
for
penalty
only
hope
cut
off
this
question
i
put
and
he
answered
me
seldom
it
happens
that
any
one
of
us
maketh
the
journey
on
which
i
am
going
it
is
true
that
another
time
i
was
conjured
down
here
by
that
cruel
erichtho
who
was
wont
to
call
back
shades
into
their
bodies
short
while
had
my
flesh
been
bare
of
me
when
she
made
me
enter
within
that
wall
in
order
to
drag
out
for
her
a
spirit
from
the
circle
of
judas
that
is
the
lowest
place
and
the
darkest
and
the
farthest
from
the
heaven
that
encircles
all
well
do
i
know
the
road
therefore
assure
thyself
this
marsh
which
breathes
out
the
great
stench
girds
round
about
the
woeful
city
wherein
now
we
can
not
enter
without
anger
dante
asks
for
assurance
that
virgil
whose
station
is
in
limbo
the
first
grade
knows
the
way
and
more
he
said
but
i
hold
it
not
in
mind
because
my
eye
had
wholly
attracted
me
toward
the
high
tower
with
the
ruddy
summit
where
in
an
instant
were
uprisen
suddenly
three
infernal
furies
stained
with
blood
who
had
the
limbs
of
women
and
their
action
and
were
girt
with
greenest
hydras
little
serpents
and
cerastes
they
had
for
hair
wherewith
their
savage
brows
were
bound
and
he
who
well
knew
the
handmaids
of
the
queen
of
the
eternal
lamentation
said
to
me
behold
the
fell
erinnyes
this
is
megaera
on
the
left
side
she
who
weeps
on
the
right
is
alecto
tisiphone
is
in
the
middle
and
therewith
he
was
silent
with
her
nails
each
was
tearing
her
breast
they
beat
themselves
with
their
hands
and
cried
out
so
loud
that
i
pressed
close
to
the
poet
through
dread
let
medusa
come
so
we
will
make
him
of
stone
they
all
said
looking
down
ill
was
it
we
avenged
not
on
theseus
his
assault
turn
thy
back
and
keep
thy
sight
closed
for
if
the
gorgon
show
herself
and
thou
shouldest
see
her
no
return
upward
would
there
ever
be
thus
said
the
master
and
he
himself
turned
me
and
did
not
so
trust
to
my
hands
that
with
his
own
he
did
not
also
blindfold
me
o
ye
who
have
sound
understanding
regard
the
doctrine
that
is
hidden
under
the
veil
of
the
strange
verses
and
already
was
coming
across
the
turbid
waves
a
tumult
of
a
sound
full
of
terror
at
which
both
the
shores
trembled
not
otherwise
it
was
than
of
a
wind
impetuous
through
the
opposing
heats
that
strikes
the
forest
and
without
any
stay
shatters
the
branches
beats
down
and
carries
them
away
forward
laden
with
dust
it
goes
superb
and
makes
the
wild
beasts
and
the
shepherds
fly
my
eyes
he
loosed
and
said
now
direct
the
nerve
of
sight
across
the
ancient
scum
there
yonder
where
that
fume
is
most
bitter
as
frogs
before
the
hostile
snake
all
scatter
through
the
water
till
each
huddles
on
the
ground
i
saw
more
than
a
thousand
destroyed
souls
flying
thus
before
one
who
at
the
ford
was
passing
over
the
styx
with
dry
feet
from
his
face
he
removed
that
thick
air
waving
his
left
hand
oft
before
him
and
only
with
that
trouble
seemed
he
weary
well
i
perceived
that
he
was
sent
from
heaven
and
i
turned
me
to
the
master
and
he
made
sign
that
i
should
stand
quiet
and
bow
down
unto
him
ah
how
full
of
disdain
he
seemed
to
me
he
reached
the
gate
and
with
a
little
rod
he
opened
it
for
there
was
no
withstanding
o
outcasts
from
heaven
folk
despised
began
he
upon
the
horrible
threshold
wherefore
is
this
overweening
harbored
in
you
why
do
ye
kick
against
that
will
from
which
its
end
can
never
be
cut
short
and
which
many
a
time
hath
increased
your
grief
what
avails
it
to
butt
against
the
fates
your
cerberus
if
ye
remember
well
still
bears
his
chin
and
his
throat
peeled
for
that
then
he
turned
back
upon
the
filthy
road
and
said
no
word
to
us
but
wore
the
semblance
of
a
man
whom
other
care
constrains
and
stings
than
that
of
him
who
is
before
him
and
we
moved
our
feet
toward
the
city
confident
after
his
holy
words
within
we
entered
without
any
strife
and
i
who
had
desire
to
observe
the
condition
which
such
a
stronghold
locks
in
when
i
was
within
sent
my
eyes
round
about
and
i
see
on
every
hand
a
great
plain
full
of
woe
and
of
cruel
torment
as
at
arles
where
the
rhone
stagnates
as
at
pola
near
the
quarnaro
that
shuts
in
italy
and
bathes
its
borders
sepulchres
make
all
the
place
uneven
so
did
they
here
on
every
side
saving
that
the
manner
was
more
bitter
here
for
among
the
tombs
flames
were
scattered
by
which
they
were
so
intensely
kindled
that
no
art
requires
iron
more
so
all
their
lids
were
lifted
and
such
dire
laments
were
issuing
forth
from
them
as
truly
seemed
of
wretches
and
of
sufferers
and
i
master
who
are
these
folk
that
buried
within
those
coffers
make
themselves
heard
with
their
woeful
sighs
and
he
to
me
here
are
the
heresiarchs
with
their
followers
of
every
sect
and
the
tombs
are
much
more
laden
than
thou
thinkest
like
with
like
is
buried
here
and
the
monuments
are
more
and
less
hot
and
when
he
to
the
right
hand
had
turned
we
passed
between
the
torments
and
the
high
battlements
canto
x
the
sixth
circle
farinata
degli
frederick
ii
now
along
a
narrow
path
between
the
wall
of
the
city
and
the
torments
my
master
goeth
on
and
i
behind
his
shoulders
o
virtue
supreme
i
began
that
through
the
impious
circles
turnest
me
according
to
thy
pleasure
speak
to
me
and
satisfy
my
desires
the
folk
that
are
lying
in
the
sepulchres
can
they
be
seen
all
the
lids
are
now
lifted
and
no
one
keepeth
guard
and
he
to
me
all
shall
be
locked
in
when
from
jehoshaphat
they
shall
here
return
with
the
bodies
which
they
have
left
on
earth
upon
this
side
epicurus
with
all
his
followers
who
make
the
soul
mortal
with
the
body
have
their
burial
place
therefore
as
to
the
demand
that
thou
makest
of
me
thou
shalt
soon
be
satisfied
here
within
and
also
as
to
the
desire
concerning
which
thou
art
silent
to
me
and
i
good
leader
i
hold
not
my
heart
hidden
from
thee
except
in
order
to
speak
little
and
not
only
now
to
that
hast
thou
disposed
me
o
tuscan
who
through
the
city
of
fire
alive
art
going
speaking
thus
modestly
may
it
please
thee
to
stop
in
this
place
thy
speech
makes
manifest
that
thou
art
native
of
that
noble
fatherland
to
which
perchance
i
was
too
molestful
suddenly
this
sound
issued
from
one
of
the
coffers
wherefore
i
drew
in
fear
a
little
nearer
to
my
leader
and
he
said
to
me
turn
what
dost
thou
behold
farinata
who
hath
uprisen
thou
shalt
see
him
all
from
the
girdle
up
i
had
already
fixed
my
face
on
his
and
he
straightened
himself
up
with
breast
and
front
as
though
he
had
hell
in
great
scorn
and
the
bold
and
ready
hands
of
my
leader
pushed
me
among
the
sepulchres
to
him
saying
let
thy
words
be
choice
when
i
was
at
the
foot
of
his
tomb
he
looked
at
me
a
little
and
then
as
though
disdainful
asked
me
who
were
thy
ancestors
i
who
was
desirous
to
obey
concealed
them
not
but
disclosed
them
all
to
him
whereon
he
raised
his
brows
a
little
up
then
said
fiercely
were
they
adverse
to
me
and
to
my
fathers
and
to
my
party
so
that
twice
i
scattered
them
if
they
were
driven
out
they
returned
from
every
side
replied
i
to
him
both
one
and
the
other
time
but
yours
have
not
learned
well
that
art
dante
ancestors
were
guelphs
then
there
arose
to
view
uncovered
down
to
the
chin
a
shade
at
the
side
of
this
one
i
think
that
it
had
risen
on
its
knees
round
about
me
it
looked
as
if
it
had
desire
to
see
if
another
were
with
me
but
when
its
expectancy
was
quite
extinct
weeping
it
said
if
through
this
blind
dungeon
thou
goest
through
loftiness
of
genius
my
son
where
is
he
and
why
is
he
not
with
thee
and
i
to
him
of
myself
i
come
not
he
who
waits
yonder
leads
me
through
here
whom
perchance
your
guido
held
in
scorn
guido
cavalcanti
was
charged
with
the
same
sin
of
unbelief
as
his
father
dante
regards
this
as
a
sin
specially
contrary
to
right
reason
typified
by
virgil
his
words
and
the
mode
of
the
punishment
had
already
read
to
me
the
name
of
this
one
wherefore
my
answer
was
so
full
suddenly
straightening
up
he
cried
how
didst
thou
say
held
lives
he
not
still
doth
not
the
sweet
light
strike
his
eyes
when
he
took
note
of
some
delay
that
i
made
before
answering
he
fell
again
supine
and
forth
appeared
no
more
but
that
other
magnanimous
one
at
whose
instance
i
had
stayed
changed
not
aspect
nor
moved
his
neck
nor
bent
his
side
and
if
he
said
continuing
his
first
words
they
have
ill
learned
that
art
it
torments
me
more
than
this
bed
but
the
face
of
the
lady
who
ruleth
here
will
not
be
rekindled
fifty
times
ere
thou
shalt
know
how
much
that
art
weighs
and
so
mayest
thou
return
unto
the
sweet
world
tell
me
wherefore
is
that
people
so
pitiless
against
my
race
in
its
every
law
then
i
to
him
the
rout
and
the
great
carnage
that
colored
the
arbia
red
cause
such
orison
to
be
made
in
our
temple
after
he
had
sighing
shaken
his
head
in
that
i
was
not
alone
he
said
nor
surely
without
cause
would
i
have
moved
with
the
rest
but
i
was
alone
there
where
it
was
agreed
by
every
one
to
lay
florence
waste
he
who
defended
her
with
open
face
ah
so
hereafter
may
your
seed
repose
i
prayed
to
him
loose
for
me
that
knot
which
here
has
entangled
my
judgment
it
seems
if
i
rightly
hear
that
ye
foresee
that
which
time
is
bringing
with
him
and
as
to
the
present
have
another
way
we
see
he
said
like
those
who
have
feeble
light
the
things
that
are
far
from
us
so
much
still
shineth
on
us
the
supreme
leader
when
they
draw
near
or
are
our
intelligence
is
all
vain
and
if
some
one
report
not
to
us
we
know
nothing
of
your
human
state
therefore
thou
canst
comprehend
that
our
knowledge
will
be
utterly
dead
from
that
moment
when
the
gate
of
the
future
shall
he
closed
then
as
compunctious
for
my
fault
i
said
now
wilt
thou
therefore
tell
that
fallen
one
that
his
son
is
still
conjoined
with
the
living
and
if
just
now
i
was
dumb
to
answer
make
him
know
that
i
was
so
because
i
was
still
thinking
in
that
error
which
you
have
solved
for
me
at
empoli
in
after
the
defeat
of
the
florentine
guelphs
at
montaperti
on
the
arbia
guido
cavalcanti
died
in
august
his
death
being
near
at
hand
at
the
time
of
dante
journey
was
not
known
to
his
father
and
now
my
master
was
calling
me
back
wherefore
i
prayed
the
spirit
more
hastily
that
he
would
tell
me
who
was
with
him
he
said
to
me
here
with
more
than
a
thousand
do
i
lie
here
within
is
the
second
frederick
and
the
cardinal
and
of
the
others
i
am
silent
ottaviano
degli
ubaldini
a
fierce
ghibelline
who
was
reported
as
saying
if
there
be
a
soul
i
have
lost
it
for
the
ghibellines
thereon
he
hid
himself
and
i
toward
the
ancient
poet
turned
my
steps
reflecting
on
that
speech
which
seemed
hostile
to
me
he
moved
on
and
then
thus
going
he
said
to
me
why
art
thou
so
distraught
and
i
satisfied
his
demand
let
thy
memory
preserve
that
which
thou
hast
heard
against
thyself
commanded
me
that
sage
and
now
attend
to
this
and
he
raised
his
finger
when
thou
shalt
be
in
presence
of
the
sweet
radiance
of
her
whose
beautiful
eye
sees
everything
from
her
thou
shalt
learn
the
journey
of
thy
life
then
to
the
left
he
turned
his
step
we
left
the
wall
and
went
toward
the
middle
by
a
path
which
strikes
into
a
valley
that
even
up
there
its
stench
made
displeasing
canto
xi
the
sixth
circle
tomb
of
pope
discourse
of
virgil
on
the
divisions
of
the
lower
hell
upon
the
edge
of
a
high
bank
formed
by
great
rocks
broken
in
a
circle
we
came
above
a
more
cruel
pen
and
here
because
of
the
horrible
excess
of
the
stench
that
the
deep
abyss
throws
out
we
drew
aside
behind
the
lid
of
a
great
tomb
whereon
i
saw
an
inscription
which
said
pope
anastasius
i
hold
he
whom
photinus
drew
from
the
right
way
our
descent
must
needs
be
slow
so
that
the
sense
may
first
accustom
itself
a
little
to
the
dismal
blast
and
then
will
be
no
heed
of
it
thus
the
master
and
i
said
to
him
some
compensation
do
thou
find
that
the
time
pass
not
lost
and
be
behold
i
am
thinking
of
that
my
son
within
these
rocks
he
began
to
say
are
three
circlets
from
grade
to
grade
like
those
thou
leavest
all
are
full
of
accursed
spirits
but
in
order
that
hereafter
sight
only
may
suffice
thee
hear
how
and
wherefore
they
are
in
constraint
of
every
malice
that
wins
hate
in
heaven
injury
is
the
end
and
every
such
end
afflicts
others
either
by
force
or
by
fraud
but
because
fraud
is
the
peculiar
sin
of
man
it
most
displeaseth
god
and
therefore
the
fraudulent
are
the
lower
and
more
woe
assails
them
the
first
circle
is
wholly
of
the
violent
but
because
violence
can
be
done
to
three
persons
in
three
rounds
it
is
divided
and
constructed
unto
god
unto
one
self
unto
neighbor
may
violence
be
done
i
mean
unto
them
and
unto
their
belongings
as
thou
shalt
hear
in
plain
discourse
by
violence
death
and
grievous
wounds
are
inflicted
on
one
neighbor
and
on
his
substance
ruins
burnings
and
harmful
robberies
wherefore
homicides
and
every
one
who
smites
wrongfully
devastators
and
freebooters
all
of
them
the
first
round
torments
in
various
troops
the
first
circle
below
the
seventh
in
the
order
of
hell
man
may
lay
violent
hands
upon
himself
and
on
his
goods
and
therefore
in
the
second
round
must
needs
repent
without
avail
whoever
deprives
himself
of
your
world
gambles
away
and
squanders
his
property
and
laments
there
where
he
ought
to
be
joyous
laments
on
earth
because
of
violence
done
to
what
should
have
made
him
happy
violence
may
be
done
to
the
deity
by
denying
and
blaspheming
him
in
heart
and
despising
nature
and
his
bounty
and
therefore
the
smallest
round
seals
with
its
signet
both
sodom
and
cahors
and
him
who
despising
god
speaks
from
his
heart
fraud
by
which
every
conscience
is
bitten
man
may
practice
on
one
that
confides
in
him
or
on
one
that
owns
no
confidence
this
latter
mode
seemeth
to
destroy
only
the
bond
of
love
that
nature
makes
wherefore
in
the
second
circle
nestle
hypocrisy
flatteries
and

the

has
been
converted

taught

dante
may
have
learned
from

that
love
and
hate
were
the
forces
by
which
the
elements
of
which
the
world
is
composed
were
united
and
dissociated
the
effort
of
love
was
to
draw
all
things
into
a
simple
perfect
sphere
by
which
the
common
order
of
the
world
would
be
brought
to
chaos
oh

cupidity
both
guilty
and
mad
that
so
spurs
us
in
the
brief
life
and
then
in
the
eternal
steeps
us
so
ill
i
saw
a
broad
ditch
bent
in
an
arc
like
one
that
embraces
all
the
plain
according
as
my
guide
had
said
and
between
the
foot
of
the
bank
and
it
in
a
file
were
running
centaurs
armed
with
arrows
as
they
were
wont
in
the
world
to
go
to
the
chase
seeing
us
descending
all
stopped
and
from
the
troop
three
detached
themselves
with
bows
and
arrows
first
selected
and
one
shouted
from
afar
to
what
torment
are
ye
coming
ye
who
descend
the
slope
tell
it
from
there
if
not
i
draw
the
bow
my
master
said
we
will
make
answer
unto
chiron
near
you
there
ill
was
it
that
thy
will
was
ever
thus
hasty
then
he
touched
me
and
said
that
is
nessus
who
died
for
the
beautiful
dejanira
and
he
himself
wrought
vengeance
for
himself
and
that
one
in
the
middle
who
is
gazing
on
his
breast
is
the
great
chiron
who
nurtured
achilles
that
other
is
pholus
who
was
so
full
of
wrath
round
about
the
ditch
they
go
by
thousands
shooting
with
their
arrows
what
soul
lifts
itself
from
the
blood
more
than
its
guilt
has
allotted
it
we
drew
near
to
those
fleet
wild
beasts
chiron
took
a
shaft
and
with
the
notch
put
his
beard
backward
upon
his
jaw
when
he
had
uncovered
his
great
mouth
he
said
to
his
companions
are
ye
aware
that
the
one
behind
moves
what
he
touches
so
are
not
wont
to
do
the
feet
of
the
dead
and
my
good
leader
who
was
now
at
his
breast
where
the
two
natures
are
conjoined
replied
truly
he
is
alive
and
thus
all
alone
it
behoves
me
to
show
him
the
dark
valley
necessity
brings
him
hither
and
not
delight
one
withdrew
from
singing
alleluiah
who
committed
unto
me
this
new
office
he
is
no
robber
nor
i
a
thievish
spirit
but
by
that
power
through
which
i
move
my
steps
along
so
savage
a
road
give
to
us
one
of
thine
to
whom
we
may
be
close
that
he
may
show
us
where
the
ford
is
and
may
carry
this
one
on
his
back
for
he
is
not
a
spirit
who
can
go
through
the
air
chiron
turned
upon
his
right
breast
and
said
to
nessus
turn
and
guide
them
thus
and
if
another
troop
encounter
you
make
it
give
way
we
moved
on
with
the
trusty
escort
along
the
edge
of
the
crimson
boiling
in
which
the
boiled
were
making
loud
shrieks
i
saw
folk
under
it
up
to
the
brow
and
the
great
centaur
said
these
are
tyrants
who
gave
themselves
to
blood
and
pillage
here
they
weep
their
pitiless
offenses
here
is
alexander
and

dionysius
who
caused
sicily
to
have
woeful
years

which
hath
such

other
who
is
blond
is

who
in
truth
was
slain
by
his
stepson
up
there
in

then
i
turned
me
to
the
poet
and
he
said
let
him
now
be
first
and
i
second
a
little
further
on
the
centaur
stopped
above
some
folk
who
far
as
the
throat
were
seen
to
issue
from
that
boiling
stream
he
showed
to
us
at
one
side
a
solitary
shade
and
said
he
cleft
in
the
bosom
of
god
the
heart
that
still
is
honored
on
the
thames
then
i
saw
folk
who
out
of
the
stream
held
their
head
and
even
all
their
chest
and
of
these
i
recognized
many
thus
ever
more
and
more
shallow
became
that
blood

it
cooked

the

the

would
have
thee
believe

on

more

more

it
comes

not

before

know

he
began
to
say
to
me
and
wilt
be
till
thou
shalt
come
unto
the
horrible
sand
therefore
look
well
around
and
so
thou
shalt
see
things
that
would
take
credence
from
my
speech
things
which
if
told
would
seem
incredible
i
heard
wailings
uttered
on
every
side
and
i
saw
no
one
who
might
make
them
wherefore
i
all
bewildered
stopped
i
believe
that
he
believed
that
i
believed
that
all
these
voices
issued
amid
those
stumps
from
people
who
because
of
us
had
hidden
themselves
therefore
said
the
master
if
thou
break
off
a
twig
from
one
of
these
plants
the
thoughts
thou
hast
will
all
be
cut
short
then
i
stretched
my
hand
a
little
forward
and
plucked
a
branchlet
from
a
great
and
its
trunk
cried
out
why
dost
thou
rend
me
when
it
had
become
dark
with
blood
it
began
again
to
cry
why
dost
thou
tear
me
hast
thou
not
any
spirit
of
pity

we
were
and
now
we
are
become

truly
thy
hand
ought
to
be
more
pitiful
had
we
been

souls
of

as
from

that
is
burning
at
one
of
its
ends
and
from
the
other
drips
and
hisses
with
the
air
that
is
escaping
so
from
that
broken
splinter
came
out
words
and
blood
together
whereon
i
let
the
tip
fall
and
stood
like
a
man
who
is
afraid
if
he
had
been
able
to
believe
before
replied
my
sage
o
wounded
soul
what
he
has
seen
only
in
my
verse
he
would
not
upon
thee
have
stretched
his
hand
but
the
incredible
thing
made
me
prompt
him
to
an
act
which
grieves
my
very
self
but
tell
him
who
thou
wast
so
that
by
way
of
some
amends
he
may
refresh
thy
fame

one
may
revest
himself
with

for
it
is
not
just
to
have
that
of
which
one
deprives
himself
hither
shall
we
drag
them
and
through
the
melancholy
wood
shall
our
bodies
be
suspended
each
on
the
of
his
molested
shade
the
tearing
of
the
leaves
gives
an
outlet
to
the
woe
our
bodies
at
the
last
judgment
we
were
still
attentive
to
the
trunk
believing
that
it
might
wish
to
say
more
to
us
when
we
were
surprised
by
an
uproar
as
one
who
perceives
the
wild
boar
and
the
chase
coming
toward
his
stand
and
hears
the
feasts
and
the
branches
crashing
and
behold
two
on
the
left
hand
naked
and
scratched
flying
so
violently
that
they
broke
all
the
limbs
of
the
wood
the
one
in
front
was
shouting
now
help
help
death
and
the
other
who
seemed
to
himself
too
slow
lano
thy
legs
were
not
so
nimble
at
the
jousts
of
the
toppo
and
when
perhaps
his
breath
was
failing
of
himself
and
of
a
bush
he
made
a
group
behind
them
the
wood
was
full
of
black
bitches
ravenous
and
running
like
greyhounds
that
have
been
unleashed
on
him
that
had
squatted
they
set
their
teeth
and
tore
him
to
pieces
bit
by
bit
then
carried
off
his
woeful
limbs

was
slain
in
flight
at

defeat

and

guide
then
took
me
by

me
to

was
weeping
through
its
bleeding
breaks

jacomo

andrea
it
was
saying
what
hath
it
vantaged
thee
to
make
of
me
a
screen
what
blame
have
i
for
thy
wicked
life
when
the
master
had
stopped
beside
it
he
said
who
wast
thou
who
through
so
many
wounds
blowest
forth
with
blood
thy
woeful
speech
and
he
to
us
o
souls

art
arrived
to

the
shameful
ravage
that
hath
thus
disjoined

wretched

was

the

which
for

changed

wherefore
will
he
always
make
her
sorrowful

it
not

at

of
those
who
have
done
violence
to
the
burning
figure
of
the
old
man
in
the
rivers
of

because
the
charity
of
my
native
place
constrained
me
i
gathered
up
the
scattered
leaves
and
gave
them
back
to
him
who
was
already
hoarse
then
we
came
to
the
confine
where
the
second
round
is
divided
from
the
third
and
where
is
seen
a
horrible
mode
of
justice
to
make
clearly
manifest
the
new
things
i
say
that
we
had
reached
a
plain
which
from
its
bed
removeth
every
plant
the
woeful
wood
is
a
garland
round
about
it
even
as
the
dismal
foss
to
that
here
on
the
very
edge
we
stayed
our
steps
the
floor
was
a
dry
and
dense
sand
not
made
in
other
fashion
than
that
which
of
old
was
trodden
by
the
feet
of
cato
o
vengeance
of
god
how
much
thou
oughtest
to
be
feared
by
every
one
who
readeth
that
which
was
manifest
unto
mine
eyes
of
naked
souls
i
saw
many
flocks
that
were
all
weeping
very
miserably
and
diverse
law
seemed
imposed
upon
them
some
folk
were
lying
supine
on
the
ground
some
were
seated
all
crouched
up
and
others
were
going
about
continually
those
who
were
going
around
were
far
the
more
and
those
the
fewer
who
were
lying
down
under
the
torment
but
they
had
their
tongues
more
loose
for
wailing
over
all
the
sand
with
a
slow
falling
were
raining
down
dilated
flakes
of
fire
as
of
snow
on
alps
without
a
wind
as
the
flames
which
alexander
in
those
hot
parts
of
india
saw
falling
upon
his
host
solid
to
the
ground
wherefore
he
took
care
to
trample
the
soil
by
his
troops
because
the
vapor
was
better
extinguished
while
it
was
single
so
was
descending
the
eternal
glow
whereby
the
sand
was
kindled
like
tinder
beneath
the
steel
for
doubling
of
the
dole
without
repose
was
ever
the
dance
of
the
wretched
hands
now
there
now
here
brushing
from
them
the
fresh
burning
i
began
master
thou
that
overcomest
everything
except
the
obdurate
demons
who
at
the
entrance
of
the
gate
came
out
against
us
who
is
that
great
one
that
seemeth
not
to
heed
the
fire
and
lies
scornful
and
contorted
so
that
the
rain
seems
not
to
ripen
him
and
that
same
one
who
had
perceived
that
i
was
asking
my
leader
about
him
cried
out
such
as
i
was
alive
such
am
i
dead
though
jove
weary
his
smith
from
whom
in
wrath
he
took
the
sharp
thunderbolt
wherewith
on
my
last
day
i
was
smitten
or
though
he
weary
the
others
turn
by
turn
in
mongibello
at
the
black
forge
crying
vulcan
help
help
even
as
he
did
at
the
fight
of
phlegra
and
should
hurl
on
me
with
all
his
might
thereby
he
should
not
have
glad
vengeance
then
my
leader
spoke
with
force
so
great
that
i
had
not
heard
him
so
loud
o
capaneus
in
that
thy
pride
is
not
quenched
art
thou
the
more
punished
no
torture
save
thine
own
rage
would
be
a
pain
adequate
to
thy
fury
then
he
turned
round
to
me
with
better
look
saying
he
was
one
of
the
seven
kings
that
besieged
thebes
and
he
held
and
it
appears
that
he
holds
god
in
disdain
and
little
it
appears
that
he
prizes
him
but
as
i
said
to
him
his
own
despites
are
very
due
adornments
for
his
breast
now
come
on
behind
me
and
take
heed
withal
not
to
set
thy
feet
upon
the
burning
sand
but
keep
them
always
close
unto
the
wood
silent
we
came
to
where
spirts
forth
from
the
wood
a
little
streamlet
the
redness
of
which
still
makes
me
shudder
as
from
the
bulicame
issues
a
brooklet
which
then
the
sinful
women
share
among
them
so
this
down
across
the
sand
went
along
its
bed
and
both
its
sloping
banks
were
made
of
stone
and
the
margins
on
the
side
whereby
i
perceived
that
the
crossing
was
there
the
bulicame
a
hot
spring
near
viterbo
much
frequented
as
a
bath
the
use
of
a
portion
of
which
was
assigned
to
sinful
women
the
crossing
of
the
breadth
of
the
round
of
burning
sand
on
the
way
inward
toward
the
next
circle
among
all
else
that
i
have
shown
to
thee
since
we
entered
through
the
gate
whose
threshold
is
barred
to
no
one
nothing
has
been
discerned
by
thine
eyes
so
notable
as
is
the
present
stream
which
deadens
all
the
flamelets
upon
it
these
words
were
of
my
leader
wherefore
i
prayed
him
that
he
should
give
me
largess
of
the
food
for
which
he
had
given
me
largess
of
desire
in
mid
sea
sits
a
wasted
land
said
he
then
which
is
named
crete
under
whose
king
the
world
of
old
was
chaste
a
mountain
is
there
that
of
old
was
glad
with
waters
and
with
leaves
which
is
called
ida
now
it
is
desert
like
a
thing
outworn
rhea
chose
it
of
old
for
the
trusty
cradle
of
her
little
son
and
to
conceal
him
better
when
he
cried
had
shoutings
made
there
within
the
mountain
stands
erect
a
great
old
man
who
holds
his
shoulders
turned
towards
damietta
and
looks
at
rome
as
if
his
mirror
his
head
is
formed
of
fine
gold
and
pure
silver
are
his
arms
and
breast
then
he
is
of
brass
far
as
to
the
fork
from
there
downward
he
is
all
of
chosen
iron
save
that
his
right
foot
is
of
baked
clay
and
he
stands
erect
on
that
more
than
on
the
other
every
part
except
the
gold
is
cleft
with
a
fissure
that
trickles
tears
which
collected
perforate
that
cavern
their
course
falls
from
rock
to
rock
into
this
valley
they
form
acheron
styx
and
phlegethon
then
it
goes
down
through
this
narrow
channel
far
as
where
there
is
no
more
descending
they
form
cocytus
and
what
that
pool
is
thou
shalt
see
therefore
here
is
it
not
told
this
image
is
taken
directly
from
the
dream
of
nebuchadnezzar
daniel
ii
it
is
the
type
of
the
ages
of
tradition
and
history
with
its
back
to
the
past
its
face
toward
rome
the
seat
of
the
empire
and
of
the
church
the
tears
of
the
sin
and
suffering
of
the
generations
of
man
form
the
rivers
of
hell
and
i
to
him
if
the
present
rill
floweth
down
thus
from
our
world
why
doth
it
appear
to
us
only
at
this
rim
and
he
to
me
thou
knowest
that
the
place
is
round
and
though
thou
art
come
far
ever
to
the
left
descending
toward
the
bottom
not
yet
hast
thou
turned
through
the
whole
circle
wherefore
if
a
new
thing
appears
to
us
it
ought
not
to
bring
wonder
to
thy
face
and
i
again
master
where
are
phlegethon
and
lethe
found
for
of
the
one
thou
art
silent
and
of
the
other
thou
sayest
that
it
is
formed
by
this
rain
in
all
thy
questions
surely
thou
pleasest
me
he
answered
but
the
boiling
of
the
red
water
ought
truly
to
solve
one
that
thou
askest
lethe
thou
shalt
see
but
outside
of
this
ditch
there
where
souls
go
to
lave
themselves
when
sin
repented
of
is
taken
away
then
he
said
now
it
is
time
to
depart
from
the
wood
take
heed
that
thou
come
behind
me
the
margins
afford
way
for
they
are

burning

in

we
were
now
so
remote
from
the

that
i
could
not
have
seen
where
it
was
though
i
had
turned
me
round
to
look
when
we
encountered
a
troop
of
souls
which
was
coming
along
by
the
bank
and
each
of
them
was
looking
at
us
as
at

one
is
wont
to
look
at
another
under

and
they
so
sharpened
their
brows
toward
us
as
the

does

eye
thus
gazed
at
by
that
company
i
was
recognized
by
one
who
took
me
by
the
hem
and
cried
out
what
a
marvel
and
when
he
stretched
out
his
arm
to
me
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
his
baked
aspect
so
that
his
scorched
visage
prevented
not
my
mind
from
recognizing
him
and
bending
down
my
own
to
his
face
i
answered
are
you
here
sir
brunetto
and
he
o
my
son
let
it
not
displease
thee
if
brunetto
latini
turn
a

with
thee
and
let

said
to
him
with

i
pray
this

you

if
you

i

it
became

nest
of
so
much
malice
after
his
flight
from

catiline
betook
himself
to
faesulae
fiesole
and
here
for
a
time
held
out
against

the

ran
that
after

faesulae
was
destroyed

to

you

for
in

is
fixed
and
now
fills
my
heart
the
dear
good
paternal
image
of
you
when
in
the
world
hour
by
hour
you
taught
me
how
man
makes
himself
eternal
and
in
what
gratitude
i
hold
it
so
long
as
i
live
it
behoves
that
on
my
tongue
should
be
discerned
that
which
you
tell
me

was
i
in

where
the
resounding
of
the

that

falling
into

was
heard
like
that
hum
which
the

make
when
three

together
separated
themselves
running
from
a
troop
that
was
passing
under
the
rain
of
the
bitter
torment
they
came
toward

and
each
cried
out
stop

to
us
to

from
our
wicked

ah
me
what
wounds
i
saw
upon

recent

old
burnt
in
by
the
flames
still
it
grieves
me
for
them
but
to
remember
it
to
their
cries
my

gave
heed
he
turned
his

toward

now

he
said
to
these
one
should
be
courteous
and
were
it
not
for
the
fire
that
the
nature
of
the
place
shoots
out
i
should
say
that
haste
better
befitted
thee
than
them
they
began
again
when
we
stopped
the
old
verse
and
when
they
had
reached
us
they
made
a
wheel
of
themselves
all
three
as
champions
naked
and
oiled
are
wont
to
do
watching
their
hold
and
their
vantage
before
they
come
to

thus
wheeling
each
directed
his
face
on
me
so
that
his
neck
in
contrary
direction
to
his
feet
was
making
continuous
journey
ah
if
the
misery
of
this
shifting
sand
bring
us
and
our
prayers
into
contempt
began

and
our
darkened
and
blistered
aspect
let
our

incline
thy
mind
to
tell
us
who
thou
art

so
securely
plantest
thy
living
feet
in

whose
tracks
thou
seest

with

i
could
have

from

i
would
have
cast
myself
below
among

and
i
think
that
the
teacher
would
have
permitted
it
but
because
i
should
have
been
scorched
and
baked
fear
overcame
my
good
will
that
made
me
greedy
to
embrace
them
then
i
began
not
contempt
but
grief
did
your
condition
fix
within
me
so
that
slowly
will
it
be
all
divested
soon
as
this
my
lord
said
words
to
me
by
which
i
understood
that
such
folk
as
ye
are
might
be
coming
of
your
city
i
am
and
always
your
deeds
and
honored
names
have
i
retraced
and
heard
with
affection
i
leave
the
gall
and
go
for
the
sweet
fruits
promised
me
by
my
veracious
leader
but
far
as
the
centre
needs
must
i
first
descend
so
may
thy
soul
long
direct
thy
limbs
replied
he
then
and
so
may
thy
fame
shine
after
thee
say
if
courtesy
and
valor
abide
in
our
city
as
they
were
wont
or
if
they
have
quite
gone
forth
from
it
for
guglielmo
borsiere
who
is
in
torment
with
us
but
short
while
and
goes
yonder
with
our
companions
afflicts
us
greatly
with
his
words
nothing
is
known
from
contemporary
record
of
borsiere
but
boccaccio
tells
a
story
of
him
in
the
decameron
giorn
the
new
people
and
the
sudden
gains
have
generated
pride
and
excess
florence
in
thee
so
that
already
thou
weepest

thus
cried
i
with
face
uplifted
and
the
three
who
understood
that
for
answer
looked
one
at
the
other
as
men
look
at
hearing
truth
florence
had
grown
rapidly
in
population
and
in
wealth
during
the
last
years
of
the
thirteenth
century
if
other
times
it
costeth
thee
so
little
replied
they
all
to
satisfy
others
happy
thou
that
thus
speakest
at
thy
pleasure
therefore
if
thou
escapest
from
these
dark
places
and
returnest
to
see
again
the
beautiful
stars
when
it
shall
rejoice
thee
to
say
have
been
mind
thou
speak
of
us
unto
the
people
then
they
broke
the
wheel
and
in
flying
their
swift
legs
seemed
wings
not
an
amen
could
have
been
said
so
quickly
as
they
had
disappeared
wherefore
it
seemed
good
to
my
master
to
depart
i
followed
him
and
we
had
gone
little
way
before
the
sound
of
the
water
was
so
near
to
us
that
had
we
spoken
we
scarce
had
heard
as
that
river
on
the
left
slope
of
the
apennine
which
the
first
from
monte
veso
toward
the
east
has
its
proper
course
which
is
called
acquacheta
up
above
before
it
sinks
valleyward
into
its
low
bed
and
at
forli
no
longer

name

from
the
alp
in
falling
with
a
single
leap
there
above
san
benedetto
where
there
ought
to
be
shelter
for
a
thousand
thus
down
from
a
precipitous
bank
we
found
that
water
resounding
so
that
in
short
while
it
would
have
hurt
the
ears
at
forli
the
river
is
called
the
montone
it
was
the
first
of
the
rivers
on
the
left
of
the
apennines
that
had
its
course
to
the
sea
the
others
before
it
being

these

words
are
obscure
and
none
of
the
commentators
explain
them
satisfactorily
i
had
a
cord
girt
around
me
and
with
it
i
had
once
thought
to
take
the
leopard
of
the
dappled
skin
after
i
had
loosed
it
wholly
from
me
even
as
my
leader
had
commanded
me
i
reached
it
to
him
wound
up
and
coiled
whereon
he
turned
toward
the
right
and
somewhat
far
from
the
edge
threw
it
down
into
that
deep
abyss
and
surely
some
strange
thing
must
needs
respond
said
i
to
myself
to
the
strange
signal
which
the
master
so
follows
with
his
eye
the
leopard
of
the
dappled
skin
which
had
often
turned
back
dante
from
the
mountain
to
the
dark
wood
see

i
the
type
of
sensual
sin
the
cord
is
the
type
of
religions
asceticism
of
which
the
poet
no
longer
has
need
the
meaning
of
its
use
as
a
signal
is
not
apparent
ah
how
cautious
men
ought
to
be
near
those
who
see
not
only
the
act
but
with
their
wisdom
look
within
the
thoughts
he
said
to
me
soon
will
come
up
that
which
i
await
and
what
thy
thought
is
dreaming
must
soon
discover
itself
unto
thy
sight
to
that
truth
which
has
the
aspect
of
falsehood
ought
one
always
to
close
his
lips
so
far
as
he
can
because
without
fault
it
causes
shame
but
here
i
can
not
be
silent
and
by
the
notes
of
this
comedy
reader
i
swear
to
thee
so
may
they
not
be
void
of
lasting
grace
that
i
saw
through
that
thick
and
dark
air
a
shape
come
swimming
upwards
marvelous
to
every
steadfast
heart
like
as
he
returns
who
goes
down
sometimes
to
loose
an
anchor
that
grapples
either
a
rock
or
other
thing
that
in
the
sea
is
hid

stretches
upward
and
draws
in
his
feet

began
my
leader
to
speak
to
me
and
he
beckoned
to
him
that
he
should
come
to
shore
near
the
end
of
the
trodden
marbles

that
loathsome
image
of
fraud
came
onward
and
landed
his
head
and
his
body
but
drew
not
his
tail
upon
the
bank
his
face
was
the
face
of
a
just
man
so
benignant

of
a

beside
he
had
two
paws

stony
margin
of

on

virgil

have
crossed
the
sand
as
sometimes

lie
on
the
shore
so
that
they
are
partly
in
water
and
partly
on
the
ground
and
as
yonder
among
the
gluttonous
germans
the
beaver
settles
himself
to
make
his

so
lay
that
worst
of
beasts
upon
the
rim
that
closes
in
the
sand
with
stone
in
the
void
all
his
tail
was
quivering
twisting
upwards
its
venomous
fork
which
like
a
scorpion
armed
the
point
with
his
tail
in
the
water
to
catch
his
prey
as
was
popularly
believed
the
leader
said
now
needs
must
our
way
bend
a
little
toward
that
wicked
beast
that
is
couching
there
therefore
we
descended
on
the
right
hand
and
took
ten
steps
upon
the
verge
quite
to
avoid
the
sand
and
flame
and
when
we
had
come
to
it
i
see
a
little
farther
on
people
sitting
upon
the
sand
near
to
the
void
place
these
people
are
the
third
class
of
sinners
punished

this
round
of
the
seventh

who
have
done
violence

the

said
to

in

that

now
go
and
see
their
condition
let
thy
discourse
there
be
brief
till
thou
returnest
i
will
speak
with
this
one
that
he
may
concede
to
us
his
strong
shoulders
thus
still
up
by
the
extreme
head
of
that
seventh
circle
all
alone
i
went
where
the
sad
people
were
sitting
through
the
eyes
their
woe
was
bursting
forth
this
way
and
that
they
helped
with
their
hands
sometimes
against
the
vapors
and
sometimes
against
the
hot
soil
not
otherwise
do
the
dogs
in
summer
now
with
muzzle
now
with
paw
when
they
are
bitten
either
by
fleas
or
flies
or
gadflies
when
i
set
my
eyes
on
the
face
of
some
on
whom
the
woeful
fire
falls
not
one
of
them
i
recognized
but
i
perceived
that
from
the
neck
of
each
was
hanging
a
pouch
that
had
a
certain
color
and
a
certain
device
and
thereupon
it
seems
their
eyes
feed
and
as
i
looking
come
among
them
i
saw
upon
a
yellow
purse
azure
that
had
the
face
and
bearing
of
a
lion
then
as
the
current
of
my
look
proceeded
i
saw
another
red
as
blood
display
a
goose
whiter
than
butter
and
one
who
had
his
little
white
bag
marked
with
an
azure
and
pregnant
sow
said
to
me
what
art
thou
doing
in
this
ditch
now
get
thee
gone
and
since
thou
art
still
alive
know
that
my
neighbor
vitaliano
will
sit
here
at
my
left
side
with
these
florentines
am
i
a
paduan
often
they
stun
my
ears
shouting
let
the
sovereign
cavalier
come
who
will
bring
the
pouch
with
the
three
goats
then
he
twisted
his
mouth
and
stuck
out
his
tongue
like
an
ox
that
licks
his
nose
the
falling
flames
dante
thus
indicates
that
they
were
not
worthy
to
be
known
the
blazon
of
their
arms
by
which
dante
learns
who
they
are
this
was
the
device
of
the
gianfigliazzi
a
guelph
family
of
florence
the
next
was
that
of
the
ubriachi
ghibellines
also
of
florence
arms
of
the
scrovigni
of
padua
one
giovanni
buiamonte
of
florence
who
surpassed
all
others
of
the
time
in
usury
says
benvenuto
da
imola
and
i
fearing
lest
longer
stay
might
vex
him
who
had
admonished
me
to
stay
but
little
turned
back
from
these
weary
souls
i
found
my
leader
who
had
already
mounted
upon
the
croup
of
the
fierce
animal
and
he
said
to
me
now
be
strong
and
courageous
henceforth
the
descent
is
by
such
stairs
mount
thou
in
front
for
i
wish
to
be
between
so
that
the
tail
can
not
do
thee
harm
not
by
foot
nor
by
boat
as
heretofore
but
carried
by
living
ministers
of
hell
as
is
he
who
hath
the
shivering
fit
of
the
quartan
so
near
that
his
nails
are
already
pallid
and
he
is
all
of
a
tremble
only
looking
at
the
shade
such
i
became
at
these
words
uttered
but
his
reproaches
wrought
shame
in
me
which
in
presence
of
a
good
lord
makes
a
servant
strong
i
seated
myself
on
those
huge
shoulders
i
wished
to
speak
thus
take
heed
that
thou
embrace
me
but
the
voice
came
not
as
i
had
thought
but
he
who
other
time
had
succored
me
in
other
peril
soon
as
i
mounted
clasped
and
sustained
me
with
his
arms
and
he
said
geryon
move
on
now
let
the
circles
be
wide
and
the
descending
slow
consider
the
strange
burden
that
thou
hast
as
a
little
vessel
goeth
from
its
place
backward
backward
so
he
thence
withdrew
and
when
he
felt
himself
quite
at
play
he
turned
his
tail
to
where
his
breast
had
been
and
moved
it
stretched
out
like
an
eel
and
with
his
paws
gathered
the
air
to
himself
greater
fear
i
do
not
think
there
was
when
phaethon
abandoned
the
reins
whereby
heaven
as
is
still
apparent
was
scorched
nor
when
the
wretched
icarus
felt
his
flanks
unfeathering
through
the
melting
of
the
wax
his
father
shouting
to
him
ill
way
thou
holdest
than
mine
was
when
i
saw
that
i
was
in
the
air
on
every
side
and
saw
every
sight
vanished
except
that
of
the
beast
he
goes
along
swimming
very
slowly
wheels
and
descends
but
i
perceive
it
not
save
by
the
wind
upon
my
face
and
from
below
i
heard
now
on
the
right
hand
the
gorge
making
beneath
us
a
horrible
roar
wherefore
i
stretch
out
my
head
with
my
eyes
downward
then
i
became
more
afraid
to
lean
over
because
i
saw
fires
and
heard
laments
whereat
i
trembling
wholly
cowered
back
and
i
saw
then
what
i
had
not
seen
before
the
descending
and
the
wheeling
by
the
great
evils
that
were
drawing
near
on
diverse
sides
as
the
falcon
which
has
been
long
on
wing
that
without
sight
of
lure
or
bird
makes
the
falconer
say
ah
me
thou
stoopest
descends
weary
there
whence
he
had
set
forth
swiftly
through
a
hundred
circles
and
lights
far
from
his
master
disdainful
and
sullen
so
geryon
set
us
at
the
bottom
at
the
very
foot
of
the
scarped
rock
and
disburdened
of
our
persons
darted
away
as

from

there
is
a

called

all
of

of
the

as
is
the
encircling

that
surrounds
it
right
in
the
middle
of

malign
yawns
an
abyss
exceeding
wide
and
deep
the
structure
of
which
i
will
tell
of
in
its
place
that
belt
therefore
which
remains
between
the
abyss
and
the
foot
of
the
high
bank
is
circular
and
it
has
its
ground
divided
into
ten

an
aspect
as
where
for
guard
of
the

many
moats
encircle
castles
the
place
where
they
are
presents
such
image
did
these
make
here
and
as
in
such
strongholds
from
their
thresholds
to
the
outer
bank
are
little
bridges
so
from
the
base
of
the
precipitous

started
crags
which
traversed
the

as
the
abyss
that
collects
and
cuts
them
off
in
this
place
shaken
off
from
the
back
of
geryon
we
found
ourselves
and
the
poet
held
to
the
left
and
i
moved
on
behind
on
the
right
hand
i
saw
new
sorrow
new
torments
and
new
scourgers
with
which
the
first
pit
was
replete
at
its
bottom
were
the
sinners
naked
this
side
the

they
came
facing
us
on
the
farther
side
with
us
but
with
swifter
pace
as
the
romans
because
of
the
great
host
in
the
year
of
jubilee
have
taken
means
upon
the
bridge
for
the
passage
of
the
people
who
on
one
side
all
have
their
front
toward
the
castle
and
go
to
saint
peter
and
on
the
other
toward
the

the
year
from

to
easter
of
sant
angelo
the
capitoline
along
the
gloomy
rock
on
this
side
and
on
that
i
saw
horned
demons
with
great
scourges
who
were
beating
them
cruelly
from
behind
ah
how
they
made
them
lift
their
heels
at
the
first
blows
truly
not
one
waited
for
the
second
or
the
third
while
i
was
going
on
my
eyes
encountered
one
and
i
said
straightway
ere
now
for
sight
of
him
i
have
not
fasted
wherefore
to
shape
him
out
i
stayed
my
feet
and
the
sweet
leader
stopped
with
ire
and
assented
to
my
going
somewhat
back
and
that
scourged
one
thought
to
conceal
himself
by
lowering
his
face
but
little
it
availed
him
for
i
said
o
thou
that
castest
thine
eye
upon
the
ground
if
the
features
that
thou
bearest
are
not
false
thou
art
venedico
caccianimico
but
what
brings
thee
unto
such
pungent
sauces
and
he
to
me
unwillingly
i
tell
it
but
thy
clear
speech
compels
me
which
makes
me
recollect
the
olden
world
i
was
he
who
brought
the
beautiful
ghisola
to
do
the
will
of
the
marquis
how
ever
the
shameful
tale
may
be
reported
and
not
the
only
bolognese
do
i
weep
here
nay
this
place
is
so
full
of
them
that
so
many
tongues
are
not
now
taught
between
savena
and
the
reno
to
say
sipa
and
if
of
this
thou
wishest
pledge
or
testimony
bring
to
mind
our
avaricious
heart
as
he
spoke
thus
a
demon
struck
him
with
his
scourge
and
said
begone
pandar
here
are
no
women
for
coining
his
own
sister
the
unseemly
tale
is
known
only
through
dante
and
his
commentators
and
the
latter
while
agreeing
that
the
marquis
was
one
of
the
esti
of
ferrara
do
not
agree
as
to
which
of
them
he
was
bologna
lies
between
the
savena
and
the
reno
sipa
is
the
bolognese
form
of
sia
or
si
i
rejoined
my
escort
then
with
few
steps
we
came
to
where
a
crag
jutted
from
the
bank
easily
enough
we
ascended
it
and
turning
to
the
right
upon
its
ridge
from
those
eternal
circles
we
departed
forming
a
bridge
thrown
like
an
arch
across
the
pit
the
course
of
the
poets
which
has
mostly
been
to
the
left
through
the
upper
circles
is
now
generally
to
proceed
straight
across
the
lower
circles
where
fraud
is
punished
they
had
been
going
to
the
left
at
the
foot
of
the
precipice
and
consequently
turn
to
the
right
to
ascend
the
bridge
the
allegorical
intention
in
the
direction
of
their
course
is
evident
when
we
were
there
where
it
opens
below
to
give
passage
to
the
scourged
the
leader
said
stop
and
let
the
sight
strike
on
thee
of
these
other
miscreants
of
whom
thou
hast
not
yet
seen
the
face
because
they
have
gone
along
in
the
same
direction
with
us
from
the
ancient
bridge
we
looked
at
the
train
that
was
coining
toward
us
from
the
other
side
and
which
the
whip
in
like
manner
drives
on
the
good
master
without
my
asking
said
to
me
look
at
that
great
one
who
is
coming
and
seems
not
to
shed
a
tear
for
pain
what
royal
aspect
he
still
retains
he
is
jason
who
by
courage
and
by
wit
despoiled
the
colchians
of
their
ram
he
passed
by
the
isle
of
lemnos
after
the
undaunted
women
pitiless
had
given
all
their
males
to
death
there
with
tokens
and
with
ornate
words
he
deceived
hypsipyle
the
maiden
who
first
had
deceived
all
the
rest
there
he
left
her
pregnant
and
alone
such
sin
condemns
him
to
such
torment
and
also
for
medea
is
vengeance
done
with
him
goes
whoso
in
such
wise
deceives
and
let
this
suffice
to
know
of
the
first
valley
and
of
those
that
it
holds
in
its
fangs
now
we
were
where
the
narrow
path
sets
across
the
second
dyke
and
makes
of
it
shoulders
for
another
arch
here
we
heard
people
moaning
in
the
next
pit
and
snorting
with
their
muzzles
and
with
their
palms
beating
themselves
the
banks
were
encrusted
with
a
mould
because
of
the
breath
from
below
that
sticks
on
them
and
was
making
quarrel
with
the
eyes
and
with
the
nose
the
bottom
is
so
hollowed
out
that
no
place
sufficeth
us
for
seeing
it
without
mounting
on
the
crest
of
the
arch
where
the
crag
rises
highest
hither
we
came
and
thence
down
in
the
ditch
i
saw
people
plunged
in
an
excrement
that
seemed
as
if
it
proceeded
from
human
privies
and
while
i
am
searching
down
there
with
my
eye
i
saw
one
with
his
head
so
foul
with
ordure
that
it
was
not
apparent
whether
he
were
layman
or
clerk
he
shouted
to
me
why
art
so
greedy
to
look
more
at
me
than
at
the
other
filthy
ones
and
i
to
him
because
if
i
remember
rightly
ere
now
i
have
seen
thee
with
dry
hair
and
thou
art
alessio
interminei
of
lucca
therefore
i
eye
thee
more
than
all
the
rest
and
he
then
beating
his
pate
down
here
those
flatteries
wherewith
my
tongue
was
never
cloyed
have
submerged
me
of
him
nothing
is
known
but
what
these
words
tell
hereupon
my
leader
mind
thou
push
thy
sight
a
little
farther
forward
so
that
with
thine
eyes
thou
mayest
quite
reach
the
face
of
that
dirty
and
disheveled
creature
who
is
scratching
herself
there
with
her
nasty
nails
and
now
is
crouching
down
and
now
standing
on
foot
she
is
thais
the
prostitute
who
answered
her
paramour
when
he
said
i
great
thanks
from
thee
marvelous
and
herewith
let
our
sight
be
satisfied
these
words
are
derived
from
terence
eunuchus
act
iii
sc
canto

eighth
circle
third

pope
nicholas

oh
simon
magus
oh
ye
his

followers
who
rapacious
do
prostitute
for
gold
and
silver
the
things
of
god
that
ought
to
be
the
brides
of
righteousness
now
it
behoves
for
you
the
trumpet
sound
since
ye
are
in
the
third
pit
already
were
we
come
to
the
next
tomb
mounted
on
that
part
of
the
crag
which
just
above
the
middle
of
the
ditch
hangs
plumb
oh
supreme
wisdom
how
great
is
the
art
that
thou
displayest
in
heaven
on
earth
and
in
the
evil
world
and
how
justly
doth
thy
power
distribute
the
next
bolgia
or
pit
i
saw
along
the
sides
and
over
the
bottom
the
livid
stone
full
of
holes
all
of
one
size
and
each
was
circular
they
seemed
to
me
not
less
wide
nor
larger
than
those
that
in
my
beautiful
saint
john
are
made
as
place
for
the
baptizers
one
of
which
not
many
years
ago
i
broke
for
sake
of
one
who
was
stifling
in
it
and
be
this
the
seal
to
undeceive
all
men
forth
from
the
mouth
of
each
protruded
the
feet
of
a
sinner
and
his
legs
up
to
the
calf
and
the
rest
was
within
the
soles
of
all
were
both
on
fire
wherefore
their
joints
quivered
so
violently
that
they
would
have
snapped
withes
and
bands
as
the
flaming
of
things
oiled
is
wont
to
move
only
on
the
outer
surface
so
was
it
there
from
the
heels
to
the
toes
my
beautiful
saint
john
is
the
baptistery
at
florence
in
dante
time
the
infants
born
during
the
year
were
all
here
baptized
by
immersion
mostly
on
the
day
of
john
baptist
the
of
june
there
was
a
large
circular
font
in
the
middle
of
the
church
and
around
it
in
its
marble
wall
were
four
cylindrical
for
the
priests
closed
by
doors
to
protect
them
from
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
who
is
he
master
that
writhes
quivering
more
than
the
others
his
consorts
said
i
and
whom
a
ruddier
flame
is
sucking
and
he
to
me
if
thou
wilt
that
i
carry
thee
down
there
by
that
bank
which
slopes
the
most
from
him
thou
shalt
know
of
himself
and
of
his
wrongs
and
i
whatever
pleaseth
thee
even
so
is
good
to
me
thou
art
lord
and
knowest
that
i
part
me
not
from
thy
will
and
thou
knowest
that
which
is
unspoken
the
whole
of
the
eighth
circle
slopes
toward
the
centre
so
that
the
inner
wall
of
each
bolgia
is
lower
and
is
less
sharply
inclined
than
the
outer
then
we
went
upon
the
fourth
dyke
turned
and
descended
on
the
left
hand
down
to
the
bottom
pierced
with
holes
and
narrow
and
the
good
master
set
me
not
down
yet
from
his
haunch
till
he
brought
me
to
the
cleft
of
him
who
was
thus
lamenting
with
his
shanks
o
thou
art
that
keepest
upside
down
sad
soul
planted
like
a
stake
i
began
to
say
speak
if
thou
canst
i
was
standing
like
the
friar
who
confesses
the
perfidious
assassin
who
after
he
is
fixed
recalls
him
in
order
to
delay
his
death
such
criminals
were
not
infrequently
punished
by
being
set
head
downwards
in
a
hole
in
which
they
were
buried
alive
and
he
cried
out
art
thou
already
standing
there
art
thou
already
standing
there
boniface
by
several
years
the
record
lied
to
me
art
thou
so
quickly
sated
with
that
having
for
which
thou
didst
not
fear
to
seize
by
guile
the
beautiful
lady
and
then
to
do
her
outrage
this
is
nicholas
pope
from
to
he
takes
dante
to
be
boniface
but
boniface
was
not
to
die
till
compare
what
nicholas
says
of
the
record
with
statement
in
canto
x
concerning
the
foresight
of
the
damned
the
church
to
which
boniface
did
outrage
in
many
forms
but
worst
by
his
simoniacal
practices
such
i
became
as
those
that
not
comprehending
that
which
is
replied
to
them
stand
as
if
mocked
and
know
not
what
to
answer
then
virgil
said
tell
him
quickly
i
am
not
he
i
am
not
he
thou
thinkest
and
i
answered
as
was
enjoined
on
me
whereat
the
spirit
quite
twisted
his
feet
thereafter
sighing
and
with
tearful
voice
he
said
to
me
then
what
dost
thou
require
of
me
if
to
know
who
i
am
concerneth
thee
so
much
that
thou
hast
crossed
the
bank
therefor
know
that
i
was
vested
with
the
great
mantle
and
verily
i
was
a
son
of
the
so
eager
to
advance
the
cubs
that
up
there
i
put
wealth
and
here
myself
into
the
purse
beneath
my
head
are
stretched
the
others
that
preceded
me
in
simony
flattened
through
the
fissures
of
the
rock
there
below
shall
i
likewise
sink
when
he
shall
come
whom
i
believed
thou
wert
then
when
i
put
to
thee
the
sudden
question
but
already
the
time
is
longer
that
i
have
cooked
my
feet
and
that
i
have
been
thus
upside
down
than
he
will
stay
planted
with
red
feet
for
after
him
will
come
of
uglier
deed
from
westward
a
shepherd
without
law
such
as
must
cover
him
and
me
again
a
new
jason
will
he
be
of
whom
it
is
read
in
maccabees
and
as
to
that
one
his
king
was
compliant
so
unto
this
he
who
rules
france
shall
be
nicholas
was
of
the
orsini
family
clement
who
will
come
from
avignon
and
in
a
little
more
than
ten
years
after
the
death
of
boniface
nicholas
had
already
cooked
his
feet
for
twenty
years
the
prophecy
of
the
death
of
clement
after
a
shorter
time
affords
an
indication
that
this
canto
was
not
written
until
after
the
year
of
his
death
the
story
of
jason
that
ungodly
wretch
and
no
who
bought
the
from
king
antiochus
is
told
in
maccabees
iv
its
application
to
the
pope
was
plain
he
who
rules
france
was
philip
the
fair
i
know
not
if
here
i
was
too
audacious
that
i
only
answered
him
in
this
strain
pray
now
tell
me
how
much
treasure
our
lord
desired
of
saint
peter
before
he
placed
the
keys
in
his
keeping
surely
he
required
nothing
save
me
nor
did
peter
or
the
others
require
of
matthias
gold
or
silver
when
he
was
chosen
to
the
place
which
the
guilty
soul
had
lost
therefore
stay
thou
for
thou
art
rightly
punished
and
guard
well
the
money
that
against
charles
made
thee
to
be
bold
and
were
it
not
that
reverence
for
the
supreme
keys
that
thou
heldest
in
the
glad
life
still
forbiddeth
me
i
would
use
words
still
more
grave
for
your
avarice
saddens
the
world
trampling
down
the
good
and
exalting
the

with

took
me

when

had
me
wholly
on

remounted
on
the
way
by
which
he
had
descended
nor
did
he
tire
of
holding
me
clasped
till
he
had
borne
me
up
to
the
summit
of
the
arch
which
is
the
passage
from
the
fourth
to

here
softly
he
laid
down
his

softly
because
of

for

so
lay

tell
me

any

my

not

held
the
summit
when
we
stopped
to
see
the
next
cleft
of
malebolge
and
the
next
vain
lamentations
and
i
saw
it
wonderfully
dark
as
in
the
arsenal
of
the
venetians
in
winter
the
sticky
pitch
for
smearing
their
unsound
vessels

boiling

they
can
not

instead
thereof
one
builds
him
a

caulks

hath
made

so
not
by

but
by
divine
art
a
thick
pitch
was
boiling
there
below
which
belimed
the
bank
on
every
side
i
saw
it
but
saw
not
in
it
aught
but
the
bubbles
which
the
boiling
raised
and
all
of
it
swelling
up
and
again
sinking
compressed
while
i
was
gazing
down
there
fixedly
my
leader
saying
take
heed
take
heed
drew
me
to
himself
from
the
place
where
i
was
standing
then
i
turned
as
one
who
is
slow
to
see
what
it
behoves
him
to
fly
and
whom
a
sudden
fear
unnerves
and
delays
not
to
depart
in
order
to
see
and
i
saw
behind
us
a
black
devil
come
running
up
along
the
crag
ah
how
fell
he
was
in
aspect
and
how
rough
he
seemed
to
me
in
action
with
wings
open
and
light
upon
his
feet
his
shoulder
which
was
sharp
and
high
was
laden
by
a
sinner
with
both
haunches
the
sinew
of
whose
feet
he
held
clutched
o
malebranche

he
said
lo
one

put
him
under

i

furnished
well
with

every
man
there
is
a
barrator
except
bonturo
there
for
money
of
no
they
make
ay
he
hurled
him
down
and
along
the
hard
crag
he
turned
and
never
mastiff
loosed
was
in
such
haste
to
follow
a
thief
malebranche
means
one
of
the
chief
magistrates
of
lucca
whose
special
protectress
was
santa
zita
a
corrupt
official
selling
justice
or
office
for

in

a
peculator
or
cheat
ironical
that
one
sank
under
and
came
up
back
uppermost
but
the
demons
that
had
shelter
of
the
bridge
cried
out
here
the
holy
face
avails
not
here
one
swims
otherwise
than
in
the
serchio
therefore
if
thou
dost
not
want
our
grapples
make
no
show
above
the
pitch
then
they
struck
him
with
more
than
a
hundred
prongs
and
said
covered
must
thou
dance
here
so
that
if
thou
canst
thou
mayst
swindle
secretly
not
otherwise
cooks
make
their
scullions
plunge
the
meat
with

that

cross
ascribed
to

still
venerated
at
lucca
the
river
that
runs
not
far
from
lucca
the
good
master
said
to
me
in
order
that
it
be
not
apparent
that
thou
art
here
crouch
down
behind
a
splinter
that
may
afford
some
screen
to
thee
and
at
any
offense
that
may
be
done
to
me
be
not
afraid
for
i
have
knowledge
of
these
things
because
another
time
i
was
at
such
a
fray
then
he
passed
on
beyond
the
head
of
the
bridge
and
when
he
arrived
upon
the
sixth
bank
he
had
need
of
a
steadfast
front
with
such
fury
and
with
such
storm
as
dogs
run
out
upon
the
poor
wretch
who
of
a
sudden
begs
where
he
stops
they
came
forth
from
under
the
little
bridge
and
turned
against
him
all
their
forks
but
he
cried
out
be
no
one
of
you
savage
ere
your
hook
take
hold
of
me
let
one
of
you
come
forward
that
he
may
hear
me
and
then
take
counsel
as
to
grappling
me
all
cried
out
let
malacoda
go
whereon
one
moved
and
the
rest
stood
still
and
he
came
toward
him
saying
what
doth
this
avail
him
thinkest
thou
malacoda
to
see
me
come
here
said
my
master
safe
hitherto
from
all
your
hindrances
except
by
will
divine
and
fate
propitious
let
us
go
on
for
in
heaven
it
is
willed
that
i
show
another
this
savage
road
then
was
his
arrogance
so
fallen
that
he
let
the
hook
drop
at
his
feet
and
said
to
the
rest
now
let
him
not
be
struck
wicked
tail
and
my
leader
to
me
o
thou
that
sittest
cowering
among
the
splinters
of
the
bridge
securely
now
return
to
me
whereat
i
moved
and
came
swiftly
to
him
and
the
devils
all
pressed
forward
so
that
i
feared
they
would
not
keep
their
compact
and
thus
i
once
saw
the
afraid
who
came
out
under
pledge
from
caprona
seeing
themselves
among
so
many
enemies
i
drew
with
my
whole
body
alongside
my
leader
and
turned
not
mine
eyes
from
their
look
which
was
not
good
they
lowered
their
forks
and
wilt
thou
that
i
touch
him
on
the
rump
said
one
to
the
other
and
they
answered
yes
see
thou
nick
it
for
him
but
that
demon
who
was
holding
speech
with
my
leader
turned
very
quickly
and
said
stay
stay
scarmiglione
in
august
the
town
of
caprona
on
the
arno
surrendered
to
the
florentine
troops
with
whom
dante
was
serving
then
he
said
to
us
further
advance
along
this
crag
there
can
not
be
because
the
sixth
arch
lies
all
shattered
at
the
bottom
and
if
to
go
forward
still
is
your
pleasure
go
on
along
this
rocky
bank
near
by
is
another
crag
that
affords
a
way
yesterday
five
hours
later
than
this
hour
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
years
were
complete
since
the
way
was
broken
here
i
am
sending
thitherward
some
of
these
of
mine
to
see
if
any
one
is
airing
himself
go
ye
with
them
for
they
will
not
be
wicked
come
forward
alichino
and
calcabrina
began
he
to
say
and
thou

ten
let
libicocco
come

and
draghignazzo
tusked
ciriatto

graffiacane
and
farfarello
and
mad
rubicante
search
round
about
the
boiling
pitch
let
these
be
safe
far
as
the
next
crag
that
all
unbroken
goes
over
these
dens
by
the
earthquake

the
death

is
it
that
i

pray
let
us
go
alone

i

wary

thou
art

be
dost
thou
not
see
that
they
show
their

threaten
harm
to
us
with
their
brows
and
he
to
me
i
would
not
have
thee
afraid
let
them
grin
on
at
their
will
for
they
are
doing
it
at
the
boiled
wretches
upon
the
left
bank
they
wheeled
round
but
first
each
had
pressed
his
tongue
with
his
teeth
toward
their
leader
for
a
signal
and
he
had
made
a
trumpet

his

i
have
seen
of
old
horsemen
moving
camp
and
beginning
an
assault
and
making
their
muster
and
sometimes
setting
forth
on
their
escape
i
have
seen

i
have
seen
freebooters
starting

struck
and
jousts
run
at
times
with
trumpets
and
at
times
with
bells
with
drums
and
with
signals
from
strongholds
and
with
native
things
and
foreign
but
never
with
so
strange
a
pipe
did
i
see
horsemen
or
footmen
set
forth
or

by
sign
of
land
or

we
went
along
with
the
ten
demons
ah
the
fell
company
but
in
the
church
with
saints
and
in
the
tavern
with
gluttons
ever
on
the
pitch
was
i
intent
to
see
every
aspect
of
the
pit
and
of
the
people
that
were
burning
in
it
as
dolphins
when
by
the
arching
of
their
back
they
give
a
sign
to
sailors
that
they
take
heed
for
the
safety
of
their
vessel
so
now
and
then
to
alleviate
his
pain
one
of
the
sinners
showed
his
back
and
hid
in
less
time
than
it
lightens
and
as
at
the
edge
of
the
water
of
a
ditch
the
frogs
stand
with
only
their
muzzle
out
so
that
they
conceal
their
feet
and
the
rest
of
their
bulk
thus
stood
on
every
side
the
sinners
but
as
barbariccia
approached
so
did
they
draw
back
beneath
the
boiling
i
saw
and
still
my
heart
shudders
at
it
one
waiting
just
as
it
happens
that
one
frog
stays
and
another
jumps
and
graffiacane
who
was
nearest
over
against
him
hooked
him
by
his
pitchy
locks
and
drew
him
up
so
that
he
seemed
to
me
an
otter
i
knew
now
the
name
of
every
one
of
them
so
had
i
noted
them
when
they
were
chosen
and
when
they
had
called
each
other
i
had
listened
how
o
rubicante
see
thou
set
thy
claws
upon
him
so
thou
flay
him
shouted
all
the
accursed
ones
together
and
i
my
master
see
if
thou
canst
that
thou
find
out
who
is
the
luckless
one
come
into
the
hands
of
his
adversaries
my
leader
drew
up
to
his
side
asked
him
whence
he
was
and
he
replied
i
was
born
in
the
kingdom
of
navarre
my
mother
placed
me
in
service
of
a
lord
for
she
had
borne
me
to
a
ribald
destroyer
of
himself
and
of
his
substance
afterward
i
was
of
the
household
of
the
good
king
thibault
there
i
set
myself
to
practice
barratry
for
which
i
pay
reckoning
in
this
heat
probably
thibault
the
of
st
louis
who
accompanied
him
on
his
last
disastrous
crusade
and
died
on
his
way
home
in
and
ciriatto
from
whose
mouth
protruded
on
either
side
a
tusk
as
in
a
boar
made
him
feel
how
one
of
them
rips
among
evil
cats
the
mouse
had
come
but
barbariccia
clasped
him
in
his
arms
and
said
stand
off
while
i
enfork
him
and
to
my
master
turned
his
face
ask
said
he
if
thou
desirest
to
know
more
from
him
before
some
other
undo
him
the
leader
now
then
tell
of
the
other
sinners
knowst
thou
any
one
under
the
pitch
who
is
italian
and
he
i
parted
short
while
since
from
one
who
was
a
neighbor
to
it
would
that
with
him
i
still
were
covered
so
that
i
might
not
fear
claw
or
hook
and
libicocco
said
we
have
borne
too
much
and
seized
his
arm
with
his
grapple
so
that
tearing
he
carried
off
a
sinew
of
it
draghignazzo
also
he
wished
to
give
him
a
clutch
down
at
his
legs
whereat
their
decurion
turned
round
about
with
evil
look
when
they
were
a
little
appeased
my
leader
without
delay
asked
him
who
still
was
gazing
at
his
wound
who
was
he
from
whom
thou
sayest
thou
madest
in
parting
to
come
to
shore
and
he
replied
it
was
brother
gomita
he
of
gallura
vessel
of
all
fraud
who
held
the
enemies
of
his
lord
in
hand
and
dealt
so
with
them
that
they
all
praise
him
for
it
money
he
took
and
let
them
smoothly
off
so
he
says
and
in
other
offices
besides
he
was
no
little
barrator
but
sovereign
with
him
frequents
don
michael
zanche
of
logodoro
and
in
talking
of
sardinia
their
tongues
feel
not
weary
o
me
see
ye
that
other
who
is
grinning
i
would
say
more
but
i
fear
lest
he
is
making
ready
to
scratch
my
itch
and
the
grand
provost
turning
to
farfarello
who
was
rolling
his
eyes
as
if
to

said

thee
away

for

was
another
of
the
judicatures
of

don
michael
zanche
was
a
noted
man
but
of
his
special
sins
little
or
nothing
has
been
recorded
by
the
chroniclers
if
you
wish
to
see
or
to
hear

or

thereon
began
again
the
frightened
one
i
will
make
them
come
but
let
the
malebranche
stand
a
little
withdrawn
so
that
they
may
not
be
afraid
of
their
vengeance
and
i
sitting
in
this
very
place
for
one
that
i
am
will
make
seven
of
them
come
when
i
shall
whistle
as
is
our
wont
to
do
whenever
one
of
us
comes
out
cagnazzo
at
this
speech
raised
his
muzzle
shaking
his
head
and
said
hear
the
knavery
he
has
devised
for
throwing
himself
under
whereon
he
who
had
snares
in
great
plenty
answered

to
him
if
thou

i
will
not
come
behind
thee
at
a
gallop
but
i
will
beat
my
wings
above
the
pitch
let
the
ridge
be
left
and
be
the
bank
a
shield
to
see
if
thou
alone
availest
more
than
we
o
thou
that
readest
thou
shalt
hear
new
sport
each
turned
his
eyes
to
the
other
side
he
first
who
had
been
most
averse
to
doing
it
the
navarrese
chose
well
his
time
planted
his
feet
firmly
on
the
ground
and
in
an
instant
leaped
and
from
their
purpose
freed
himself
at
this
each
of
them
was
pricked
with
shame
but
he
most
who
was
the
cause
of
the
loss
wherefore
he
started
and
cried
out
thou
art
caught
but
little
it
availed
for
wings
could
not
outstrip
fear
the
one
went
under
and
the
other
flying
turned
his
breast
upward
not
otherwise
the
wild
duck
on
a
sudden
dives
when
the
falcon
comes
close
and
he
returns
up
vexed
and
baffled
calcabrina
enraged
at
the
flout
kept
flying
behind
him
desirous
that
the
sinner
should
escape
that
he
might
have
a
scuffle
and
when
the
barrator
had
disappeared
he
turned
his
talons
upon
his
companion
and
grappled
with
him
above
the
ditch
but
the
other
was
indeed
a
sparrowhawk
full
grown
to
gripe
him
well
and
both
fell
into
the
midst
of
the
boiling
pool
the
heat
was
a
sudden
ungrappler
but
nevertheless
there
was
no
rising
from
it
they
had
their
wings
so
glued
barbariccia
grieving
with
the
rest
of
his
troop
made
four
of
them
fly
to
the
other
side
with
all
their
forks
and
very
quickly
this
side
and
that
they
descended
to
their
post
they
stretched
out
their
hooks
toward
the
belimed
ones
who
were
already
baked
within
the
crust
and
we
left
them
thus
embroiled

and
without

we
went
on

the

behind
as
the

go
along

my
thought
was
turned
by
the
present
brawl
upon
the
fable
of
aesop
in
which
he
tells
of
the
frog
and
the
mole
for
now
and
this

are
not
more
alike
than
the

is
to
the

if
beginning

end
are
rightly
coupled
by
the
attentive
mind
and
as
one
thought
bursts
out
from

so
from
that
then
sprang
another
which
made
my
first
fear
double
i
reflected
in
this
wise
these
through
us
have
been
flouted
and
with
such
harm
and
mock
as
i
believe
must
vex
them
greatly

fortis
the
point
seems
to
be
that
the
frog
having
deceitfully
brought
the
mole
to
trouble
and
death
the
mole
declares
me
vindicabit
major
and
the
eagle
swoops
down
and
devours
the
frog
as
well
as
the
dead
mole
the
comparison
is
not
very
close
except
in
the
matter
of
anticipated
vengeance
already
i
was
feeling
my
hair
all
bristling
with
fear
and
was
backwards
intent
when
i
said
master
if
thou
concealest
not
thyself
and
me
speedily
i
am
afraid
of
the
malebranche
we
have
them
already
behind
us
and
i
so
imagine
them
that
i
already
feel
them
and
he
if
i
were
of
leaded
glass
i
should
not
draw
thine
outward
image
more
quickly
to
me
than
thine
inward
i
receive
even
now
came
thy
thoughts
among
mine
with
similar
action
and
with
similar
look
so
that
of
both
one
sole
design
i
made
if
it
be
that
the
right
bank
lieth
so
that
we
can
descend
into
the
next
pit
we
shall
escape
the
imagined
chase
a
mirror
not
yet
had
he
finished
reporting
this
design
when
i
saw
them
coming
with
spread
wings
not
very
far
off
with
will
to
take
us
my
leader
on
a
sudden
took
me
as
a
mother
who
is
wakened
by
the
noise
and
near
her
sees
the
kindled
flames
who
takes
her
son
and
flies
and
having
more
care
of
him
than
of
herself
stays
not
so
long
as
only
to
put
on
a
shift
and
down
from
the
ridge
of
the
hard
bank
supine
he
gave
himself
to
the
sloping
rock
that
closes
one
of
the
sides
of
the
next
pit
never
ran
water
so
swiftly
through
a
duct
to
turn
the
wheel
of
a
when
it
approaches
near
est
to
the
paddles
as
my
master
over
that
border
bearing
me
along
upon
his
breast
as
his
own
son
and
not
as
his
companion
hardly
had
his
feet
reached
the
bed
of
the
depth
below
when
they
were
on
the
ridge
right
over
us
but
here
there
was
no
fear
for
the
high
providence
that
willed
to
set
them
as
ministers
of
the
fifth
ditch
deprived
them
all
of
power
of
departing
thence
there
below
we
found
a
painted
people
who
were
going
around
with
very
slow
steps
weeping
and
in
their
semblance
weary
and
vanquished
they
had
cloaks
with
hoods
lowered
before
their
eyes
made
of
the
same
cut
as
those
of
the
monks
in
cluny
outwardly
they
are
gilded
so
that
it
dazzles
but
within
all
lead
and
so
heavy
that
frederick
put
them
on
of
straw
oh
mantle
wearisome
for
eternity
the
leaden
cloaks
which
the
emperor
frederick
ii
caused
to
be
put
on
criminals
who
were
then
burned
to
death
were
light
as
straw
in
comparison
with
these
we
turned
still
ever
to
the
left
hand
along
with
them
intent
on
their
sad
plaint
but
because
of
the
weight
that
tired
folk
came
so
slowly
that
we
had
fresh
company
at
every
movement
of
the
haunch
wherefore
i
to
my
leader
see
that
thou
find
some
one
who
may
be
known
by
deed
or
name
and
so
in
going
move
thy
eyes
around
and
one
who
understood
the
tuscan
speech
cried
out
behind
us
stay
your
feet
ye
who
run
thus
through
the
dusky
air
perchance
thou
shalt
have
from
me
that
which
thou
askest
whereon
the
leader
turned
and
said
await
and
then
according
to
his
pace
proceed
i
stopped
and
saw
two
show
by
their
look
great
haste
of
mind
to
be
with
me
but
their
load
delayed
them
and
the
narrow
way
when
they
had
come
up
somewhile
with
eye
askance
they
gazed
at
me
without
a
word
then
they
turned
to
each
other
and
said
one
to
the
other
this
one
seems
alive
by
the
action
of
his
throat
and
if
they
are
dead
by
what
privilege
do
they
go
uncovered
by
the
heavy
stole
then
they
said
to
me
o
tuscan
who
to
the
college
of
the
wretched
hypocrites
art
come
disdain
not
to
tell
who
thou
art
and
i
to
them
i
was
born
and
grew
up
on
the
fair
river
of
arno
at
the
great
town
and
i
am
in
the
body
that
i
have
always
had
but
ye
who
are
ye
in
whom
such
woe
distills
as
i
see
down
your
cheeks
and
what
punishment
is
on
you
that
so
sparkles
and
one
of
them
replied
to
me
the
orange
hoods
are
of
lead
so
thick
that
the
weights
thus
make
their
scales
to
creak
jovial
friars
were
we
and
bolognese
i
catalano
and
he
loderingo
named
and
together
taken
by
thy
city
as
one
man
alone
is
wont
to
be
taken
in
order
to
preserve
its
peace
and
we
were
such
as
still
is
apparent
round
about
the
gardingo
i
began
o
friars
your
evil
but
more
i
said
not
for
there
struck
mine
eyes
one
crucified
with
three
stakes
on
the
ground
when
me
he
saw
he
writhed
all
over
blowing
into
his
beard
with
sighs
and
the
friar
catalano
who
observed
it
said
to
me
that
transfixed
one
whom
thou
lookest
at
counseled
the
pharisees
that
it
was
expedient
to
put
one
man
to
torture
for
the
people
crosswise
and
naked
is
he
on
the
path
as
thou
seest
and
he
first
must
feel
how
much
whoever
passes
weighs
and
in
such
fashion
his
is
stretched
in
this
ditch
and
the
others
of
that
council
which
for
the
jews
was
seed
of
then
i
saw
virgil
marvelling
over
him
that
was
extended
on
a
cross
so
vilely
in
eternal
exile
thereafter
he
addressed
this
speech
to
the
friar
may
it
not
displease
thee
so
it
be
allowed
thee
to
tell
us
if
on
the
right
hand
lies
any
opening
whereby
we
two
can
go
out
without
constraining
any
of
the
black
angels
to
come
to
deliver
us
from
this
deep
he
answered
then
nearer
than
thou
hopest
is
a
rock
that
from
the
great
encircling
wall
proceeds
and
crosses
all
the
savage
valleys
save
that
at
this
one
it
is
broken
and
does
not
cover
it
ye
can
mount
up
over
the
ruin
that
slopes
on
the
side
and
heaps
up
at
the
bottom
the
leader
stood
a
little
while
with
bowed
head
then
said
ill
he
reported
the
matter
he
who
hooks
the
sinners
yonder
and
the
friar
i
once
heard
tell
at
bologna
vices

copies
on

the

lasts

whose

gets
up
and
sees

all
whitened
whereat

strikes

returns
indoors
and
grumbles

and
there
like
the

wretch
who
knows

to

again
goes
out
and
picks
up
hope
again
seeing
the

to
have

in

and
takes
his
crook
and
drives
forth
his
flock
to
pasture
in
like
manner
the
master
made
me
dismayed
when
i
saw
his
front
so
disturbed
and
in
like
manner
speedily
arrived
the
plaster
for
the
hurt
for
when
we
came
to
the
ruined
bridge
the
leader
turned
to
me
with
that
sweet
look
which
i
first
saw
at
the
foot
of
the
mount
he
opened
his
arms
after
some
counsel
taken
with
himself
looking
first
well
at
the
ruin
and
laid
hold
of
me
and
as
one
who
acts
and
considers
who
seems
always
to
be
ready
beforehand
so
lifting
me
up
toward
the
top
of
a
great
rock
he
took
note
of
another
splinter
saying
seize
hold
next
on
that
but
try
first
if
it
is
such
that
it
may
support
thee
it
was
no
way
for
one
clothed
in
a
cloak
for
we
with
difficulty
he
light
and
i
pushed
up
could
mount
from
jag
to
jag
and
had
it
not
been
that
on
that
precinct
the
bank
was
shorter
than
on
the
other
side
i
do
not
know
about
him
but
i
should
have
been
completely
overcome
but
because
all
malebolge
slopes
toward
the
opening
of
the
lowest
abyss
the
site
of
each
valley
is
such
that
one
side
rises
and
the
other
sinks
we
came
however
at
length
up
to
the
point
where
the
last
stone
is
broken
off
the
breath
was
so
milked
from
my
lungs
when
i
was
up
that
i
could
no
farther
but
sat
me
down
on
first
arrival
toward
the
end
of
winter
half
of
the
hours
the
frost
copies
the
look
of
the
snow
but
her
pen
soon
loses
its
cut
that
is
the
white
frost
soon
vanishes
the
hill
of
the

at
the

of

to

the

of

slopes
toward
the
central
deep
so
that
the

of

pit
is
of
less
height
than
the
outer
now
it
behoves
thee
thus
to
put
off

said
the
master
for
sitting
upon
down
or
under

one
attains
not
fame
without
which
he
who
consumes
his
life
leaves
of
himself
such
trace
on

as
smoke
in

or
in

the
foam
and
therefore
rise
up
conquer
the
exhaustion
with
the
spirit
that
conquers
every
battle
if
by
its
heavy
body
it
be
not
dragged
down
a
longer
stairway
needs
must
be
ascended
it
is
not
enough
from
these
to
have
departed
if
thou
understandest
me
now
act
so
that
it
avail
thee
then
i
rose
up
showing
myself
furnished
better
with
breath
than
i
felt
and
said
go
on
for
i
am
strong
and
resolute
up
along
the
crag
we
took
the
way
which
was
rugged
narrow
and
difficult
and
far
steeper
than
the
one
before
i
was
going
along
speaking
in
order
not
to
seem
breathless
and
a
voice
unsuitable
for
forming
words
came
out
from
the
next
ditch
i
know
not
what
it
said
though
i
was
already
upon
the
back
of
the
arch
that
crosses
here
but
he
who
was
speaking
seemed
moved
to
anger
i
had
turned
downwards
but
living
eyes
could
not
go
to
the
bottom
because
of
the
obscurity
wherefore
i
said
master
see
that
thou
go
on
to
the
next
girth
and
let
us
descend
the
wall
for
as
from
hence
i
hear
and
do
not
understand
so
i
look
down
and
shape
out
nothing
other
reply
he
said
i
give
thee
not
than
doing
for
an
honest
request
ought
to
be
followed
by
the
deed
in
silence
we
descended
the
bridge
at
its
head
where
it
joins
on
with
the
eighth
bank
and
then
the
pit
was
apparent
to
me
and
i
saw
therewithin
a
terrible
heap
of
serpents
and
of
such
hideous
look
that
the
memory
still
curdles
my
blood
let
libya
with
her
sand
vaunt
herself
no
more
for
though
she
brings
forth
chelydri
jaculi
and
phareae
and
cenchri
with
amphisboena
she
never
with
all
ethiopia
nor
with
the
land
that
lies
on
the
red
sea
showed
either
so
many
plagues
or
so
evil
amid
this
cruel
and
most
dismal
store
were
running
people
naked
and
in
terror
without
hope
of
hole
or
heliotrope
they
had
their
hands
tied
behind
with
serpents
which
fixed
through
the
reins
their
tail
and
their
head
and
were
knotted
up
in
front
a
precious
stone
of
green
color
spotted
with
red
supposed
to
make
its
wearer
invisible
and
lo
at
one
who
was
on
our
side
darted
a
serpent
that
transfixed
him
there
where
the
neck
is
knotted
to
the
shoulders
nor
nor
was
ever
so
quickly
written
as
he
took
fire
and
burned
and
all
ashes
it
behoved
him
to
become
in
falling
and
when
upon
the
ground
he
lay
thus
destroyed
the
dust
drew
together
of
itself
and
into
that
same
one
instantly
returned
thus
by
the
great
sages
it
is
affirmed
that
the
phoenix
dies
and
then
is
reborn
when
to
her
five
hundredth
year
she
draws
nigh
nor
herb
nor
grain
she
feeds
on
in
her
life
but
only
on
tears
of
incense
and
on
balsam
and
nard
and
myrrh
are
her
last
and
as
he
who
falls
and
knows
not
how
by
force
of
demon
that
drags
him
to
ground
or
of
other
attack
that
seizeth
the
man
when
he
arises
and
around
him
gazes
all
bewildered
by
the
great
anguish
that
he
has
suffered
and
in
looking
sighs
such
was
that
sinner
after
he
had
risen
oh
power
of
god
how
just
thou
art
that
showerest
down
such
blows
for
vengeance
the
leader
asked
him
then
who
he
was
whereon
he
answered
i
rained
from
tuscany
short
time
ago
into
this
fell
gullet
bestial
life
and
not
human
pleased
me
like
a

that
i
was
i

vanni

and
pistoia

my
fitting
den
and
i
to
my
leader
tell
him
not
to
budge
and
ask
what
sin
thrust
him
down
here
for
i
have
seen
him
a
man
of
blood
and
rages
and
the
sinner
who
heard
dissembled
not
but
directed
toward
me
his
mind
and
his
face
and
was
painted
with
dismal
shame
then
he
said
more
it
grieves
me
that
thou
hast
caught
me
in
the
misery
where
thou
seest
me
than
when
i
was
taken
from
the
other
life
i
can
not
refuse
that
which
thou
demandest
i
am
put
so
far
down
because
i
was
robber
of
the
sacristy

the
fair
furnishings

falsely
hitherto
has
it
been
ascribed
to

but
that
thou
enjoy
not

ever
thou
shalt

thine
ears

that
every

shall
thereby

beneath

made

dealt
him

with

and
he
felt
not

he
was
so
speaking
and
that
one
had
run
by

three
spirits
came
below
us
of
whom
neither
i
nor
my
leader
was
aware
till
when
they
cried
out
who
are
ye
whereon
our
story
stopped
and
we
then
attended
only
unto
them
i
did
not
recognize
them
but
it
happened
as
it
is
wont
to
happen
by
chance
that
one
must
needs
name
the
other
saying
cianfa
where
can
he
have
stayed
whereupon
i
in
order
that
the
leader
should
attend
put
my
finger
upward
from
my
chin
to
my
nose
if
thou
art
now
reader
slow
to
credit
that
which
i
shall
tell
it
will
not
be
a
marvel
for
i
who
saw
it
hardly
admit
it
to
myself
as
i
was
holding
my
brow
raised
upon
them
lo
a
serpent
with
six
feet
darts
in
front
of
one
and
grapples
close
to
him
with
his
middle
feet
he
clasped
his
paunch
and
with
his
forward
took
his
arms
then
struck
his
fangs
in
one
and
the
other
cheek
his
hinder
feet
he
stretched
upon
the
thighs
and
put
his
tail
between
the
two
and
behind
bent
it
up
along
the
reins
ivy
was
never
so
bearded
to
a
tree
as
the
horrible
beast
through
the
other
limbs
entwined
his
own
then
they
stuck
together
as
if
they
had
been
of
hot
wax
and
mingled
their
color
nor
one
nor
the
other
seemed
now
that
which
it
was
even
as
before
the
flame
up
along
the
paper
a
dark
color
proceeds
which
is
not
yet
black
and
the
white
dies
away
the
other
two
were
looking
on
and
each
cried
o
me
agnello
how
thou
changest
lo
now
thou
art
neither
two
nor
one
now
were
the
two
heads
become
one
when
there
appeared
to
us
two
countenances
mixed
in
one
face
wherein
the
two
were
lost
of
four
strips
the
two
arms
were
made
the
thighs
with
the
legs
the
belly
and
the
chest
became
members
that
were
never
seen
before
each
original
aspect
there
was
cancelled
both
and
neither
the
perverse
image
appeared
and
such
it
went
away
with
slow
step
the
two
fore
feet
of
the
dragon
and
the
two
arms
of
the
man
were
melted
into
two
strange
arms
as
the
lizard
under
the
great
scourge
of
the
dog
days
changing
from
hedge
to
hedge
seems
a
flash
if
it
crosses
the
way
so
seemed
coming
toward
the
belly
of
the
two
others
a
little
fiery
serpent
livid
and
black
as
a
grain
of
pepper
and
that
part
whereby
our
nourishment
is
first
taken
it
transfixed
in
one
of
them
then
fell
down
stretched
out
before
him
the
transfixed
one
gazed
at
it
but
said
nothing
nay
rather
with
feet
fixed
he
yawned
even
as
if
sleep
or
fever
had
assailed
him
he
looked
at
the
serpent
and
that
at
him
one
through
his
wound
the
other
through
his
mouth
smoked
violently
and
their
smoke
met
let
lucan
henceforth
be
silent
where
he
tells
of
the
wretched
sabellus
and
of
nasidius
and
wait
to
hear
that
which
now
is
uttered
let
ovid
be
silent
concerning
cadmus
and
arethusa
for
if
poetizing
he
converts
him
into
a
serpent
and
her
into
a
fountain
i
envy
him
not
for
two
natures
front
to
front
never
did
he
transmute
so
that
both
the
forms
were
prompt
to
exchange
their
matter
to
one
another
they
responded
by
such
rules
that
the
serpent
made
his
tail
into
a
fork
and
the
wounded
one
drew
together
his
feet
the
legs
and
the
very
thighs
with
them
so
stuck
together
that
in
short
while
the
juncture
made
no
sign
that
was
apparent
the
cleft
tail
took
on
the
shape
that
was
lost
there
and
its
skin
became
soft
and
that
of
the
other
hard
i
saw
the
arms
draw
in
through
the
armpits
and
the
two
feet
of
the
beast
which
were
short
lengthen
out
in
proportion
as
those
shortened
then
the
hinder
feet
twisted
together
became
the
member
that
man
conceals
and

from

it

up
and
the

fell
down
not
however
turning
aside
their
pitiless
lights
beneath
which
each
was
changing
his
visage
he
who
was
erect
drew
his
in
toward
the
temples
and
from
the
excess
of
material
that
came
in
there
issued
the
ears
on
the
smooth
cheeks
that
which
did
not
run
backwards
but
was
retained
of
its
superfluity
made
a
nose
for
the
face
and
thickened
the
lips
so
far
as
was
needful
he
who
was
lying
down
drives
his
muzzle
forward
and
draws
in
his
ears
through
his
skull
as
the
snail
doth
his
horns
and
his
tongue
which
erst
was
united
and
fit
for
speech
cleaves
itself
and
the
forked
one
of
the
other
closes
up
and
the
smoke
stops
the
soul
that
had
become
a
brute
fled
hissing
along
the
valley
and
behind
him
the
other
speaking
spits
then
he
turned
upon
him
his
new
shoulders
and
said
to
the
other
i
will

i
have
done
groveling
along

the

may

it

the

perhaps
there
where
he
makes

ploughs
with
as
many

all
the
eighth
pit
was
resplendent
as
i
perceived
soon
as
i
was
there
where
the
bottom
became
apparent
and
as
he
who
was
avenged
by
the
bears
saw
the
chariot
of
elijah
at
its
departure
when
the
horses
rose
erect
to
heaven
and
could
not
so
follow
it
with
his
eyes
as
to
see
aught
save
the
flame
alone
even
as
a
little
cloud
mounting
upward
thus
each
was
moving
through
the
gulley
of
the
ditch
for
not
one
shows
its
theft
and
every
flame
steals
away
a
sinner
that
is
in
the

elisha

ii
of
those
flames
within
each
flame
a
sinner
was
concealed
i
was
standing
on
the
bridge
risen
up
to
look
so
that
if
i
had
not
taken
hold
of
a
rock
i
should
have
fallen
below
without
being
pushed
and
the
leader
who
saw
me
thus
attent
said
within
these
fires
are
the
spirits
each
is
swathed
by
that
wherewith
he
is
enkindled
my

i
replied
by
hearing
thee
am
i
more
certain
but
already
i
deemed
that
it
was
so
and
already
i
wished
to
say
to
thee
who
is
in
that
fire
that
cometh
so
divided
at
its
top
that
it
seems
to
rise
from
the
pyre
on
which
eteocles
was
put
with
his
brother
he
answered
me
there
within
are
tormented
ulysses
and
diomed
and
thus
together
they
go
in
punishment
as
of
old
in
wrath
and
within
their
flame
they
groan
for
the
ambush
of
the
horse
that
made
the
gate
whence
the
gentle
seed
of
the
romans
issued
forth
within
it
they
lament
for
the
artifice
whereby
the
dead
deidamia
still
mourns
for
achilles
and
there
for
the
palladium
they
bear
the
penalty
if
they
can
speak
within
those
sparkles
said
i
master

i
pray
thee
and
repray
that
the

a

thou
make

thou
seest
that
with

i
bend
me
toward
it

he
to
me
thy

is
worthy

therefore
i
accept

restrain

the
ardor
that
i
had
to
gain
experience
of
the
world
and
of
the
vices
of
men
and
of
their
valor
but
i
put
forth
on
the
deep
open
sea
with
one
vessel
only
and
with
that
little
company
by
which
i
had
not
been
deserted
one
shore
and
the
other
i
saw
as
far
as
spain
far
as
morocco
and
the
island
of
sardinia
and
the
rest
which
that
sea
bathes
round
about
i
and
my
companions
were
old
and
slow
when
we
came
to
that
narrow
strait
where
hercules
set
up
his
bounds
to
the
end
that
man
may
not
put
out
beyond
on

no

ye
your

ye
were
not
made
to
live
as
brutes
but
for
pursuit
of
virtue
and
of
knowledge
with
this
little
speech
i
made
my
companions
so
eager
for
the
road
that
hardly
afterwards
could
i
have
held
them
back
and
turning
our
stern
to
the
morning
with
our
oars
we
made
wings
for
the
mad
flight
always
gaining
on
the
left

side
the
night

now
all

ours
so
low

it
rose
not
forth
from
the

floor
five

rekindled
and
as
many
quenched
was
the
light
beneath
the
moon
since
we
had
entered
on
the
deep
pass
when
there
appeared
to
us
a
mountain
dim
through
the
distance
and
it
appeared
to
me
so
high
as
i
had
not
seen
any
we
rejoiced
thereat
and
soon
it
turned
to
lamentation
for
from
the
strange
land
a
whirlwind
rose
and
struck
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
three
times
it
made
her
whirl
with
all
the
waters
the
fourth
it
made
her
stern
lift
up
and
the
prow
go
down
as
pleased

when
another
that
was
coming
behind

made
us
turn
our
eyes
to
its

by
a
confused
sound
that
issued
forth
therefrom
as
the

that
bellowed

with

and
that

transfixed

through

up

this

besought

he
asked
counsel
of

and
i
kept
silence
because
his
words
seemed
drunken

then
he
said
to
me
not
thy

i
absolve
thee

do
thou
teach
me

down

gave
the

who
repents
not
can
not
be

allows

so

i
think
that
a

of
my

weeps
the

that
down

costs

dear
then
said
the
master
let
not
thy

henceforth
reflect

attend

and
let
him
there
remain
for
i
saw
him
at

pointing

i
heard

thou

i
the
violent
death
which
is
not

avenged
for
him
by
any
who
is
sharer
in

made
him
indignant
wherefore
as
i
deem
he
went
on
without
speaking
to
me
and
thereby
has
he
made
me
pity
him

we
spake

as
the

on

if
more

were
there
quite
to

when
we
were
above

cloister
of

so
that
its
lay
brothers
could
appear
to
our

divers
lamentations
pierced
me
that
had
their
arrows
barbed
with
pity
wherefore
i
covered
my

with
my

such
pain
as
there
would
be
if
between

from
the
hospitals
of
valdichiana

of

the

should
all

such
was
there
here
and
such
stench
came
forth
therefrom
as
is
wont
to
come
from

we
descended
upon
the
last
bank
of
the
long
crag
ever
to

and
then
my
sight
became
more
vivid
down
toward

the

punishes
the

whom
on

noted
for

i
do
not
think
it
was
a
greater
sorrow
to
see
the
whole
people
in
egina
sick
when
the
air
was
so
full
of
pestilence
that
the
animals
even
to
the
little
worm
all
fell
dead
and
afterwards
the
ancient
people
according
as
the
poets
hold
for
sure
were
restored
by
seed
of
ants
than
it
was
to
see
the
spirits
languishing
in
different
heaps
through
that
dark
valley
this
one
over
the
belly
and
that
over
the
shoulders
of
another
was
lying
and
this
one
crawling
was
shifting
himself
along
the
dismal
path
step
by
step
we
went
without
speech
looking
at
and
listening
to
the
sick
who
could
not
lift
their
persons
i
saw
two
seated
leaning
on
each
other
as

leaned
against

never

his

by

who
keeps
awake
unwillingly
as
each
often
plied
the
bite
of
his
nails
upon
himself
because
of
the
great
rage
of
his
itching
which
has
no
other
relief
and
the
nails
dragged
down
the
scab
even
as
a

the
scales
of

of

that
may
have

thou

their

broken

the

inclined
himself
wholly

what

i
began

may
memory
of
you
not
steal
away

not

their

dries
me
up
far
more
than
the

strips
my

i
falsified

at

darkly
with

struck
him
on

it
sounded

him
on

saying

him

because
of
my
heavy

moving

be
taken
from

free

wast
not

where
thou
wast
questioned
of

at

i
spake

thou
didst
falsify

for

be
it
ill
for
thee
that
the
whole

knows
it
and
be
ill
for
thee
the
thirst
which
cracks
thy
tongue

the
putrid

that
makes
thy

thus
a
hedge
before
thine

so
yawns
thy
mouth
for
its
own
harm
as
it
is
wont
for
if
i
am
thirsty
and
humor
stuffs
me
out
thou
hast
the
burning
and
the
head
that
pains
thee
and
to
lick
the
mirror
of
narcissus
thou
wouldst
not
want
many
words
of
invitation
to
listen
to
them
was
i
wholly
fixed
when
the
master
said
to
me
now
then
look
for
it
wants
but
little
that
i
quarrel
with
thee
when
i
heard
him
speak
to
me
with
anger
i
turned
me
toward
him
with
such
shame
that
still
it
circles
through
my
memory
and
as
is
he
that
dreams
of
his
harm
and
dreaming
desires
to
dream
so
that
that
which
is
he
craves
as
if
it
were
not
such
i
became
not
being
able

i
desired
to
excuse
myself
and
i
was

excusing
myself

did
not

that
i
was

it
less
shame
doth
wash
away
a
greater
fault
than
thine
hath
been
said
the
master
therefore
disburden
thyself
of
all
regret
and
make
reckoning
that
i
am
always
at
thy
side
if
again
it
happen

discerned

part

down
along
his

both

nature
surely

left

seemed
to
me
long

huge
as

of

were
his

that

jove

wherefore
he

ephialtes

made

he
plied

nevermore
iphimedeia
bore
to

two
sons
but
they
were
lived
godlike
otus
and
ephialtes
whom
the
fruitful
earth
nourished
to
be
the
tallest
and
much
the
most
beautiful
of
mortals
except
renowned
orion
for
at
nine
years
old
they
were
nine
cubits
in
breadth
and
nine
fathoms
tall
they
even
threatened
the
immortals
raising
the
din
of
tumultuous
war
on
olympus
and
strove
to
set
ossa
upon
olympus
and
pelion
upon
ossa
in
order
to
scale
heaven
but
jove
destroyed
them
both
odyssey

and
i
to
him
if
it
may
be
i
should
like
my
eyes
to
have
experience
of
the
huge
briareus
whereon
he
answered
thou
shalt
see
antaeus
close
at
hand
here
who
speaks
and
is
unbound
and
will
set
us
at
the
bottom
of
all
sin
him
whom
thou
wishest
to
see
is
much
farther
on
and
is
bound
and
fashioned
like
this
one
save
that
he
seems
more
ferocious
in
his
look
him
of
the
hundred
hands
whom
the
gods
call
briareus
iliad
i
because
he
took
no
part
in
the
war
of
his
brethren
against
the
gods
what
dante
tells
of
him
is
derived
from
lucan
pharsalia
iv
sqq
never
was
earthquake
so
mighty
that
it
shook
a
tower
as
violently
as
ephialtes
was
quick
to
shake
himself
then
more
than
ever
did
i
fear
death
and
there
had
been
no
need
of
more
than
the
fright
if
i
had
not
seen
his
bonds
we
then
proceeded
further
forward
and
came
to
antaeus
who
full
five
ells
besides
his
head
issued
forth
from
the
cavern
o
thou
that
in
the
fateful
valley
which
made
scipio
the
heir
of
glory
when
hannibal
and
his
followers
turned
their
backs
didst
bring
of
old
a
thousand
lions
for
booty
and
it
still
seems
credible
that
hadst
thou
been
at
the
high
war
of
thy
brothers
the
sons
of
the
earth
would
have
conquered
set
us
below
and
disdain
thou
not
to
do
so
where
the
cold
locks
up
cocytus
make
us
not
go
to
tityus
nor
to
typhon
this
one
can
give
of
that
which
here
is
longed
for
therefore
stoop
and
curl
not
thy
snout
he
yet
can
restore
fame
to
thee
in
the
world
for
he
is
living
and
still
expects
long
life
if
grace
doth
not
untimely
call
him
to
itself
thus
said
the
master
and
he
in
haste
stretched
out
those
hands
whose
strong
grip
hercules
once
felt
and
took
my
leader
virgil
when
he
felt
himself
taken
up
said
to
me
come
hither
so
that
i
take
thee
then
he
made
one
bundle
of
himself
and
me
as
beneath
its
leaning
side
the
carisenda
seems
to
look
when
a
cloud
is
going
over
so
that
the
tower
hangs
counter
to
it
thus
seemed
antaeus
to
me
that
stood
attent
to
see
him
bend
and
it
was
a
moment
when
i
could
have
wished
to
go
by
another
road
but
lightly
on
the
bottom
that
swallows
lucifer
with
judas
he
set
us
down
nor
thus
bent
did
he
there
make
stay
and
like
a
mast
in
a
ship
he
raised
himself
lucan
phars
iv
naming
these
giants
says
they
were
less
strong
than
antaeus
wherefore
there
is
subtle
flattery
in
these
words
of
virgil
to
be
remembered
on
earth
the
more
inclined
of
the
two
famous
leaning
towers
at
bologna
as
the
cloud
goes
over
it
the

seems
to
bend
to
meet

their

which
before
were

gushed
up

such

made
currish

shuddering
comes

me
and
will
always
come
at
frozen

and
while
we

going

to
which
tends
every

i
was
trembling
in
the
eternal
shade
whether
it
was

or
destiny
or
fortune
i
know
not
but
walking
among
the
heads
i
struck
my
foot
hard
in
the
face
of

wailing
he
cried
out
to
me
why
dost
thou
trample
me
if
thou
comest
not
to
increase
the
vengeance
of

why
dost
thou
molest

i
my

now
wait
here
for

i
may
free
me
from
a
doubt
by
means
of
this

then
thou
shalt
make
me
hasten
as
much
as
thou
wilt
the

stopped
and
i
said
to
that
shade
who
was
bitterly
blaspheming
still
who
art
thou
that
thus
railest
at
another
now
thou
who
art
thou
that
goest
through

he
answered
smiting
the
cheeks
of
others
so
that
if
thou
wert
alive
it
would
be
too
much
alive
i
am
and
it
may
be
dear
to
thee
was
my
reply
if
thou
demandest
fame
that
i
should
set
thy
name
amid
the
other
notes
and
he
to
me
for
the
contrary
do
i
long
take
thyself
hence
and
give
me
no
more
trouble
for
ill
thou
knowest
to
flatter
on
this
plain
then
i
took
him
by
the
hair
of
the
crown
and
said
it
shall
needs
be
that
thou
name
thyself
or
that
not
a

here
whereon
he
to
me
though
thou
strip
me

i

thinking
on
what
my
heart
foretold
and
if
thou
weepest
not
at
what
art
thou
wont
to
weep
now
they
were
awake
and
the
hour
drew
near
when
food
was
wont
to
be
brought
to
us
and
because
of
his
dream
each
one
was
apprehensive
and
i
heard
the
door
below
of
the
horrible
tower
locking
up
whereat
i
looked
on
the
faces
of
my
sons
without
saying
a
word
i
wept
not
i
was
so
turned
to
stone
within
they
wept
and
my
poor
little
anselm
said
lookest
so
father
what
aileth
thee
yet
i
did
not
weep
nor
did
i
answer
all
that
day
nor
the
night
after
until
the
next
sun
came
out
upon
the
world
when
a
little
ray
entered
the
woeful
prison
and
i
discerned
by
their
four
faces
my
own
very
aspect
both
my
hands
i
bit
for
woe
and
they
thinking
i
did
it
through
desire
of
eating
of
a
sudden
rose
and
said
it
will
be
far
less
pain
to
us
if
thou
eat
of
us
thou
didst
clothe
us
with
this
wretched
flesh
and
do
thou
strip
it
off
i
quieted
me
then
not
to
make
them
more
sad
that
day
and
the
next
we
all
stayed
dumb
ah
thou
hard
earth
why
didst
thou
not
open
after
we
had
come
to
the
fourth
day
gaddo
threw
himself
stretched
out
at
my
feet
saying
father
why
dost
thou
not
help
me
here
he
died
and
even
as
thou
seest
me
i
saw
the
three
fall
one
by
one
between
the
fifth
day
and
the
sixth
then
i
betook
me
already
blind
to
groping
over
each
and
two
days
i
called
them
after
they
were
dead
then
fasting
had
more
power
than
grief
when
he
had
said
this
with
his
eyes
distorted
he
seized
again
the
wretched
skull
with
his
teeth
that
were
strong
as
a
upon
the
bone

ugolino

thou

on

we
passed
onward
to
where
the
ice
roughly
enswathes
another
folk
not
turned
downward
but
all
upon
their
backs
their
very
weeping
lets
them
not
weep
and
the
pain
that
finds
a
barrier
on
the
eyes
turns
inward
to
increase
the
anguish
for
the
first
tears
form
a
block
and
like

fill
all
the

beneath

and
although
because
of
the
cold
as
from
a
callus
all
feeling
had
left
its
abode
in
my
face
it
now
seemed
to
me
i
felt
some
wind
wherefore
i
my
master
who
moves

is
not

quenched
here
below
whereon
he
to
me

supposed
to
be

by
the
action
of

on

and
one
of
the
wretches
of

cried
out
to
us
o
souls
so
cruel
that
the
last
station
is
given
to
you
lift
from
my
eyes
the
hard
veils
so
that
i
may
vent
the
grief
that
swells
my
heart
a
little
ere
the
weeping
wherefore
i
to
him
if
thou
wilt
that
i
relieve
thee
tell
me
who
thou
art
and
if
i
rid
thee
not
may
it

how

it

me
i

because

there
was

i
was

with
fear
i
put
it
in

there
where
the

were
wholly

and
showed
through
like
a
straw
in

some
are
lying
some

erect
this
on

that
on

inverts

so
far

it
pleased
my

to
show
me
the
creature
that
had
the
fair
semblance
from
before
me
he
took
himself
and
made
me
stop
saying
behold
dis
and
behold
the
place
where
it
is
needful
that
with
fortitude
thou
arm
thee
how
i
became
then
chilled

hoarse
ask
it

i
write
it
not
because
all
speech
would
be
little
i
did
not

and
i

now
for
thyself
if
thou
hast
grain
of

what
i
became
deprived
of
one
and
the
other
the
emperor
of
the
woeful
realm
from
his
midbreast
issued
forth
from
the
ice
and
i
match
better
with
a
giant
than
the
giants
do
with
his
arms
see
now
how
great
must
be
that
whole
which
corresponds
to
such
parts
if
he
was
as
fair
as
he
now
is
foul
and
against
his
maker
lifted
up
his
brow
surely
may
all
tribulation
proceed
from
him
oh
how
great
a
marvel
it
seemed
to
me
when
i
saw
three
faces
on
his
head
one
in
front
and
that
was
red
the
others
were
two
that
were
joined
to
this
above
the
very
middle
of
each
shoulder
and
they
were
joined
together
at
the
place
of
the
crest
and
the
right
seemed
between
white
and
yellow
the
left
was
such
to
sight
as
those
who
come
from
where
the
nile
flows
valleyward
beneath
each
came
forth
two
great
wings
of
size
befitting
so
huge
a
bird
sails
of
the
sea
never
saw
i
such
they
had
no
feathers
but
their
fashion
was
of
a
bat
and
he
was
flapping
them
so
that
three
winds
went
forth
from
him
whereby
cocytus
was
all
congealed
with
six
eyes
he
was
weeping
and
over
three
chins
trickled
the
tears
and
bloody
drivel
with
each
mouth
he
was
crushing
a
sinner
with
his
teeth
in
manner
of
a
brake
so
that
he
thus
was
making
three
of
them
woeful
to
the
one
in
front
the
biting
was
nothing
to
the
clawing
so
that
sometimes
his
spine
remained
all
stripped
of
skin
that
soul
up
there
which
has
the
greatest
punishment
said
the
master
is
judas
iscariot
who
has
his
head
within
and
plies
his
legs
outside
of
the
other
two
who
have
their
heads
down
he
who
hangs
from
the
black
muzzle
is
brutus
see
how
he
writhes
and
says
no
word
and
the
other
is
cassius
who
seems
so
but
the
night
is
rising
again
and
now
we
must
depart
for
we
have
seen
the
whole
as
was
his
pleasure
i
clasped
his
neck
and
he
took
opportunity
of
time
and
place
and
when
the
wings
were
opened
wide
he
caught
hold
on
the
shaggy
flanks
from
shag
to
shag
he
then
descended
between
the
bushy
hair
and
the
frozen
crusts
when
we
were
just
where
the
thigh
turns
on
the
thick
of
the
haunch
my
leader
with
effort
and
stress
of
breath
turned
his
head
where
he
had
his
shanks
and
clambered
by
the
hair
as
a
man
that
ascends
so
that
i
thought
to
return
again
to
hell
cling
fast
hold
said
the
master
panting
like
one
weary
for
by
such
stairs
it
behoves
to
depart
from
so
much
evil
then
he
came
forth
through
the
opening
of
a
rock
and
placed
me
upon
its
edge
to
sit
then
stretched
toward
me
his
cautious
step
i
raised
my
eyes
and
thought
to
see
lucifer
as
i
had
left
him
and
i
saw
him
holding
his
legs
upward
and
if
i
then
became
perplexed
let
the
dull
folk
think
it
that
see
not
what
that
point
is
that
i
had
passed
this
point
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
when
virgil
had
turned
upon
the
haunch
of
lucifer
the
passage
had
been
made
from
one
hemisphere
of
the
earth
the
inhabited
and
known
hemisphere
to
the
other
where
no
living
men
dwell
and
where
the
only
land
is
the
mountain
of
purgatory
in
changing
one
hemisphere
for
the
other
there
is
a
change
of
time
of
twelve
hours
a
second
saturday
morning
begins
for
the
poets
and
they
pass
nearly
as
long
a
time
as
they
have
been
in
hell
that
is
hours
in
traversing
the
long
and
hard
way
that
leads
through
the
new
hemisphere
on
which
they
have
just
entered
rise
up
said
the
master
on
thy
feet
the
way
is
long
and
the
road
is
difficult
and
already
the
sun
unto
returns
tierce
is
the
church
office
sung
at
the
third
hour
of
the
day
and
the
name
is
given
to
the
first
three
hours
after
sunrise
midtierce
consequently
here
means
about
seven
in
hell
dante
never
mentions
the
sun
to
mark
division
of
time
but
now
having
issued
from
hell
virgil
marks
the
hour
by
a
reference
to
the
sun
it
was
no
hallway
of
a
palace
where
we
were
but
a
natural
dungeon
that
had
a
bad
floor
and
lack
of
light
before
i
tear
me
from
the
abyss
said
i
when
i
had
risen
up
my
master
speak
a
little
to
me
to
draw
me
out
of
error
where
is
the
ice
and
this
one
how
is
he
fixed
thus
upside
down
and
how
in
such
short
while
has
the
sun
from
eve
to
morn
made
transit
and
he
to
me
thou
imaginest
that
thou
still
art
on
the
other
side
of
the
centre
where
i
laid
hold
on
the
hair
of
the
guilty
worm
that
pierces
the
world
on
that
side
wast
thou
so
long
as
i
descended
when
i
turned
thou
didst
pass
the
point
to
which
from
all
parts
whatever
has
weight
is
drawn
and
thou
art
now
arrived
beneath
the
hemisphere
opposite
to
that
which
the
great
dry
land
covers
and
beneath
whose
zenith
the
man
was
slain
who
was
born
and
lived
without
sin
thou
hast
thy
feet
upon
the
little
sphere
which
forms
the
other
face
of
the
judecca
here
it
is
morning
when
there
it
is
evening
and
he
who
made
for
us
a
stairway
with
his
hair
is
still
fixed
even
as
he
was
before
upon
this
side
he
fell
down
from
heaven
and
the
earth
which
before
was
spread
out
here
through
fear
of
him
made
of
the
sea
a
veil
and
came
to
your
hemisphere
and
perchance
to
flee
from
him
that
land
which
on
this
side
appears
left
here
this
empty
space
and
upward
ran
back
the
mount
of
purgatory
a
place
is
there
below
stretching
as
far
from
beelzebub
as
his
tomb
extends
which
not
by
sight
is
known
but
by
the
sound
of
a
rivulet
that
here
descends
along
the
hollow
of
a
rock
that
it
has
gnawed
with
its
course
that
winds
and
little
falls
my
leader
and
i
entered
through
that
hidden
way
to
return
to
the
bright
world
and
without
care
to
have
any
repose
we
mounted
up
he
first
and
i
second
till
through
a
round
opening
i
saw
of
those
beauteous
things
which
heaven
bears
and
thence
we
came
forth
to
see
again
the
stars
hell
is
his
tomb
this
vacant
dark
passage
through
the
opposite
hemisphere
is
of
course
of
the
same
depth
as
hell
from
surface
to
centre
