making
of

britain
and
the
american
civil
war
two
volumes
bound
as
one
preface
this
work
was
begun
many
years
ago
in
i
read
in
the
british
museum
many
newspapers
and
journals
for
the
years
and
then
planned
a
survey
of
english
public
opinion
on
the
american
civil
war
in
the
succeeding
years
as
a
teacher
at
stanford
university
california
the
published
diplomatic
correspondence
of
great
britain
and
of
the
united
states
were
studied
in
connection
with
instruction
given
in
the
field
of
relations
several
of
my
students
prepared
excellent
theses
on
special
topics
and
these
have
been
acknowledged
where
used
in
this
work
many
distractions
and
other
writing
prevented
the
completion
of
my
original
plan
and
fortunately
for
when
in
i
had
at
last
begun
this
work
and
had
prepared
three
chapters
a
letter
was
received
from
the
late
charles
francis
adams
inviting
me
to
collaborate
with
him
in
preparing
a
life
of
his
father
the
charles
francis
adams
who
was
american
minister
to
great
britain
during
the
civil
war
adams
had
recently
returned
from
england
where
he
had
given
at
oxford
university
a
series
of
lectures
on
the
civil
war
and
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
obtain
copies
made
under
the
scholarly
supervision
of
worthington
ford
of
a
great
mass
of
correspondence
from
the
foreign
office
files
in
the
public
record
office
and
from
the
private
papers
in
the
possession
of
various
families
the
first
half
of
the
year
was
spent
with
adams
at
washington
and
at
south
lincoln
in
preparing
the
life
two
volumes
were
completed
the
first
by
adams
carrying
the
story
to
the
second
by
myself
for
the
period
to
for
the
third
volume
i
analysed
and
organized
the
new
materials
obtained
in
england
and
we
were
about
to
begin
actual
collaboration
on
the
most
vital
period
of
the
life
when
adams
died
and
the
work
was
indefinitely
suspended
probably
wisely
since
any
completion
of
the
life
by
me
would
have
lacked
that
individual
charm
in
historical
writing
so
markedly
characteristic
of
all
that
adams
did
the
spent
with
adams
was
an
inspiration
and
constitutes
a
precious
memory
the
great
war
interrupted
my
own
historical
work
but
in
i
returned
to
the
original
plan
of
a
work
on
great
britain
and
the
american
civil
war
in
the
hope
that
the
english
materials
obtained
by
adams
might
be
made
available
to
me
when
copies
were
secured
by
adams
in
a
restriction
had
been
imposed
by
the
foreign
office
to
the
effect
that
while
studied
for
information
citations
and
quotations
were
not
permissible
since
the
general
diplomatic
archives
were
not
yet
open
to
students
beyond
the
year
through
my
friend
sir
charles
lucas
the
whole
matter
was
again
presented
to
the
foreign
office
with
an
exact
statement
that
the
new
request
was
in
no
way
related
to
the
proposed
life
of
charles
francis
adams
but
was
for
my
own
use
of
the
materials
lord
curzon
then
foreign
secretary
graciously
approved
the
request
but
with
the
usual
condition
that
my
manuscript
be
submitted
before
publication
to
the
foreign
office
this
has
now
been
done
and
no
single
citation
censored
before
this
work
will
have
appeared
the
limitation
hitherto
imposed
on
diplomatic
correspondence
will
have
been
removed
and
the
date
for
open
research
have
been
advanced
beyond
the
end
of
the
civil
war
similar
explanations
of
my
purpose
and
proposed
work
were
made
through
my
friend
francis
hirst
to
the
owners
of
various
private
papers
and
prompt
approval
given
in
i
came
to
england
for
further
study
of
some
of
these
private
papers
the
russell
papers
transmitted
to
the
public
record
office
in
and
there
preserved
were
used
through
the
courtesy
of
the
executors
of
the
late
hon

with
the
hearty
goodwill
of

daughter
of
the
late
earl

only
living
representative
of
her
father
rollo

his
son
having
died
in

lyons
papers
preserved
in

room
at

house
were
used
through
the
courtesy
of
the
duchess
of
norfolk
who
now
represents
her
son
who
is
a
minor
the
gladstone
papers
preserved
at
hawarden
castle
were
used
through
the
courtesy
of
the
gladstone
trustees
the
few
citations
from
the
palmerston
papers
preserved
at
broadlands
were
approved
by
wilfred
ashley
the
opportunity
to
study
these
private
papers
has
been
invaluable
for
my
work
shortly
after
returning
from
england
in
worthington
ford
well
said
the
inside
history
of
diplomatic
relations
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
may
be
surmised
from

to
complete
the
picture
must
be

adams
declared
xlvii
that
without
these
papers
the
character
of
english
diplomacy
at
that
time
can
not
be
understood
it
would
appear
that
the
commonly
entertained
impressions
as
to
certain
phases
of
international
relations
and
the
proceedings
and
utterances
of
english
public
men
during
the
progress
of
the
war
of
secession
must
be
to
some
extent
revised
in
addition
to
the
new
english
materials
i
have
been
fortunate
in
the
generosity
of
my
colleague
at
stanford
university
professor
frank
golder
who
has
given
to
me
transcripts
obtained
at
petersburg
in
of
all
russian
diplomatic
correspondence
on
the
civil
war
many
friends
have
aided
by
suggestion
or
by
permitting
the
use
of
notes
and
manuscripts
in
the
preparation
of
this
work
i
have
sought
to
make
due
acknowledgment
for
such
aid
in
my
but
in
addition
to
those
already
named
i
should
here
particularly
note
the
courtesy
of
the
late
gaillard
hunt
for
facilities
given
in
the
state
department
at
washington
of
herbert
putnam
librarian
of
congress
for
the
transcript
of

correspondence
of
mason
and

confederate
commissioners
in
europe
and
of
charles

of

papers
containing

of
the
despatches
of
schleiden
minister
of
the
republic
of
bremen
at
washington
during
the
civil
war
especially
thanks
are
due
to
my
friend
herbert
hoover
for
his
early
interest
in
this
work
and
for
his
generous
aid
in
the
making
of
transcripts
which
would
otherwise
have
been
beyond
my
means
and
finally
i
owe
much
to
the
skill
and
care
of
my
wife
who
made
the
entire
typescript
for
the
press
and
whose
criticisms
were
invaluable
it
is
no
purpose
of
a
preface
to
indicate
results
but
it
is
my
hope
that
with
i
trust
a
calm
comparison
of
the
evidence
now
for
the
first
time
available
to
the
historian
a
fairly
true
estimate
may
be
made
of
what
the
american
civil
war
meant
to
great
britain
how
she
regarded
it
and
how
she
reacted
to
it
in
brief
my
work
is
primarily
a
study
in
british
history
in
the
belief
that
the

after

the

charles

at
a
time
of
depression
and
bitterness
wrote
to
secretary
of
state
seward
that
great
britain
did
in
the
most
terrible
moment
of
our
domestic
trial
in
struggling
with
a
monstrous
social
evil
she
had
earnestly
professed
to
abhor
coldly
and
at
once
assume
our
inability
to
master
it
and
then
become
the
only
foreign
nation
steadily
contributing
in
every
indirect
way
possible
to
verify
its
judgment
will
probably
be
the
verdict
made
against
her
by
posterity
on
calm
comparison
of
the

very
different
were
the
views
of
englishmen
the
historian
george
grote
could
write
the
perfect
neutrality
of
great
britain
in
this
destructive
war
appears
to
me
almost
a
phenomenon
in
political
history
no
such
forbearance
has
been
shown
during
the
political
history
of
the
last
two
centuries
it
is
the
single
case
in
which
the
english
government
and
public
generally
so
meddlesome
have
displayed
most
prudent
and
commendable
forbearance
in
spite
of
great
temptations
to
the
contrary
and
sir
william
harcourt
in
september
declared
among
all
lord
russell
many
titles
to
fame
and
to
public
gratitude

manner
in
which
he
has
steered
the
vessel
of
state
through
the
scylla
and
charybdis
of
the
american
war
will
i
think
always
stand
conspicuous
minister
adams
in
the
later
years
of
the
civil
war
saw
reason
somewhat
to
modify
his
earlier
judgment
but
his
indictment
of
great
britain
was
long
prevalent
in
america
as
indeed
it
was
also
among
the
historians
and
writers
of
continental
europe
notably
those
of
france
and
russia
to
what
extent
was
this
dictum
justified
did
great
britain
in
spite
of
her
long
years
of
championship
of
personal
freedom
and
of
leadership
in
the
cause
of
seize
upon
the
opportunity
offered
in
the
disruption
of
the
american
union
and
forgetting
humanitarian
idealisms
react
only
to
selfish
motives
of
commercial
advantage
and
national
power
in
brief
how
is
the
american
civil
war
to
be
depicted
by
historians
of
great
britain
recording
her
attitude
and
action
in
both
foreign
and
domestic
policy
and
revealing
the
principles
of
her
statesmen
or
the
inspirations
of
her
people
it
was
to
answer
this
question
that
the
present
work
was
originally
undertaken
but
as
investigation
proceeded
it
became
progressively
more
clear
that
the
great
crisis
in
america
was
almost
equally
a
crisis
in
the
domestic
history
of
great
britain
itself
and
that
unless
this
were
fully
appreciated
no
just
estimate
was
possible
of
british
policy
toward
america
still
more
it
became
evident
that
the
american
civil
war
as
seen
through
british
spectacles
could
not
be
understood
if
regarded
as
an
isolated
and
unique
situation
but
that
the
conditions
preceding
that
situation
some
of
them
lying
far
back
in
the
relations
of
the
two
nations
had
a
vital
bearing
on
british
policy
and
opinion
when
the
crisis
arose
no
expanded
examination
of
these
preceding
conditions
is
here
possible
but
it
is
to
a
summary
analysis
of
them
that
this
first
chapter
is
devoted
on
the
american
war
for
separation
from
the
mother
country
it
is
unnecessary
to
dilate
though
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
both
during
the
war
and
afterwards
there
existed
a
minority
in
great
britain
strongly
sympathetic
with
the
political
ideals
proclaimed
in
america
regarding
those
ideals
indeed
as
something
to
be
striven
for
in
britain
itself
and
the
conflict
with
america
as
in
a
measure
a
conflict
in
home
politics
but
independence
once
acknowledged
by
the
treaty
of
peace
of
the
relations
between
the
mother
country
and
the
united
states
of
america
rapidly
tended
to
adjust
themselves
to
lines
of
contact
customary
between
great
britain
and
any
other
sovereign
state
such
contacts
fixing
national
attitude
and
policy
ordinarily
occur
on
three
main
lines
governmental
determined
by
officials
in
authority
in
either
state
whose
duty
it
is
to
secure
the
greatest
advantage
in
power
and
prosperity
for
the
state
commercial
resulting
primarily
from
the
interchange
of
goods
and
the
business
opportunities
of
either
nation
in
the
other
territory
or
from
their
rivalry
in
foreign
trade
idealistic
the
result
of
comparative
development
especially
in
those
ideals
of
political
structure
which
determine
the
nature
of
the
state
and
the
form
of
its
government
the
more
obvious
of
these
contacts
is
the
governmental
since
the
attitude
of
a
people
is
judged
by
the
formal
action
of
its
government
and
indeed
in
all
three
lines
of
contact
the
government
of
a
state
is
directly
concerned
and
frequently
active
but
it
may
be
of
service
to
a
clearer
appreciation
of
british
attitude
and
policy
before
if
the
intermingling
of
elements
required
by
a
strict
chronological
account
of
relations
is
here
replaced
by
a
separate
review
of
each
of
the
three
main
lines
of
contact
once
independence
had
been
yielded
to
the
american
colonies
the
interest
of
the
british
government
rapidly
waned
in
affairs
american
true
there
still
remained
the
valued
establishments
in
the
west
indies
and
the
less
considered
british
possessions
on
the
continent
to
the
north
of
the
united
states
meanwhile
there
were
occasional
frictions
with
america
arising
from
uncertain
claims
drawn
from
the
former
colonial
privileges
of
the
new
state
or
from
boundary
contentions
not
settled
in
the
treaty
of
peace
thus
the
use
of
the
newfoundland
fisheries
furnished
ground
for
an
acrimonious
controversy
lasting
even
into
the
twentieth
century
and
occasionally
rising
to
the
danger
point
boundary
disputes
dragged
along
through
official
argument
survey
commissions
arbitration
to
final
settlement
as
in
the
case
of
the
northern
limits
of
the
state
of
maine
fixed
at
last
by
the
treaty
of
washington
of
and
then
on
lines
fair
to
both
sides
at
any
time
in
the
forty
years
of
legal
bickering
very
early
in
an
agreement
creditable
to
the
wisdom
and
pacific
intentions
of
both
countries
was
reached
establishing
small
and
equal
naval
armaments
on
the
great
lakes
the
british
fear
of
an
american
attack
on
canada
proved
groundless
as
time
went
on
and
was
definitely
set
at
rest
by
the
strict
curb
placed
by
the
american
government
upon
the
restless
activities
of
such
of
its
citizens
as
sympathized
with
the
followers
of
mckenzie
and
papineau
in
the
canadian
rebellion
of
none
of
these
governmental
contacts
affected
greatly
the
british
policy
toward
america
but
the
war
of
as
it
is
termed
in
the
united
states
madison
war
as
it
was
derisively
named
by
tory
contemporaries
in
great
britain
arose
from
serious
policies
in
which
the
respective
governments
were
in
definite
opposition
briefly
this
was
a
clash
between
belligerent
and
neutral
interests
britain
fighting
at
first
for
the
preservation
of
europe
against
the
spread
of
french
revolutionary
influence
later
against
the
napoleonic
plan
of
empire
held
the
seas
in
her
grasp
and
exercised
with
vigour
all
the
accustomed
rights
of
a
naval
belligerent
of
necessity
from
her
point
of
view
and
as
always
in
the
case
of
the
dominant
naval
belligerent
she
stretched
principles
of
international
law
to
their
utmost
interpretation
to
secure
her
victory
in
war
america
soon
the
only
maritime
neutral
of
importance
and
profiting
greatly
by
her
neutrality
contested
point
by
point
the
issue
of
exceeded
belligerent
right
as
established
in
international
law
america
did
more
she
advanced
new
rules
and
theories
of
belligerent
and
neutral
right
respectively
and
demanded
that
the
belligerents
accede
to
them
dispute
arose
over
blockades
contraband
the
british
rule
of
which
would
have
forbidden
american
trade
with
french
colonies
in
war
time
since
such
trade
was
prohibited
by
france
herself
in
time
of
peace
but
first
and
foremost
as
touching
the
personal
sensibilities
and
patriotism
of
both
countries
was
the
british
exercise
of
a
right
of
search
and
seizure
to
recover
british
sailors
moreover
this
asserted
right
brought
into
clear
view
definitely
opposed
theories
as
to
citizenship
great
britain
claimed
that
a
man
once
born
a
british
subject
could
never
cease
to
be
a
subject
could
never
alienate
his
duty
it
was
her
practice
to
fill
up
her
navy
in
part
at
least
by
the
impressment
of
her
sailor
folk
taking
them
whenever
needed
and
wherever
found
in
her
own
coast
towns
or
from
the
decks
of
her
own
mercantile
marine
but
many
british
sailors
sought
security
from
such
impressment
by
desertion
in
american
ports
or
were
tempted
to
desert
to
american
merchant
ships
by
the
high
pay
obtainable
in
the
united
states
merchant
marine
many
became
by
naturalization
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
it
was
the
duty
of
america
to
defend
them
as
such
in
their
lives
and
business
america
ultimately
came
to
hold
in
short
that
expatriation
was
accomplished
from
great
britain
when
american
citizenship
was
conferred
on
shore
they
were
safe
for
britain
did
not
attempt
to
reclaim
her
subjects
from
the
soil
of
another
nation
but
she
denied
that
the
american
flag
on
merchant
vessels
at
sea
gave
like
security
and
she
asserted
a
naval
right
to
search
such
vessels
in
time
of
peace
professing
her
complete
acquiescence
in
a
like
right
to
the
american
navy
over
british
merchant
vessels
a
concession
refused
by
america
and
of
no
practical
value
since
no
american
citizen
sought
service
in
the
british
merchant
marine
this
right
of
search
controversy
involved
then
two
basic
points
of
opposition
between
the
two
governments
first
america
contested
the
british
theory
of
once
a
citizen
always
a
citizen
second
america
denied
any
right
whatever
to
a
foreign
naval
vessel
in
of
to
stop
and
search
a
vessel
lawfully
flying
the
american
flag
the
of
search
in
time
of
that
is
a
belligerent
right
of
search
america
never
denied
but
there
was
both
then
and
later
much
public
confusion
in
both
countries
as
to
the
question
at
issue
since
once
at
war
great
britain
frequently
exercised
a
legal
belligerent
right
of
search
and
followed
it
up
by
the
seizure
of
sailors
alleged
to
be
british
subjects
nor
were
british
naval
captains
especially
careful
to
make
sure
that
no
sailors
were
included
in
their
impressment
seizures
and
as
the
accounts
spread
of
victim
after
victim
the
american
irritation
steadily
increased
true
france
was
also
an
offender
but
as
the
weaker
naval
power
her
offence
was
lost
sight
of
in
view
of
the
literally
thousands
of
americans
seized
by
great
britain
here
then
was
a
third
cause
of
irritation
connected
with
impressment
though
not
a
point
of
governmental
dispute
as
to
right
for
great
britain
professed
her
earnest
desire
to
restore
promptly
any
sailors
whom
her
naval
officers
had
seized
through
error
in
fact
many
such
sailors
were
soon
liberated
but
a
large
number
either
continued
to
serve
on
british
ships
or
to
languish
in
british
prisons
until
the
end
of
the
napoleonic
wars
there
were
other
possibly
greater
causes
of
the
war
of
most
of
them
arising
out
of
the
conflicting
interests
of
the
chief
maritime
neutral
and
the
chief
naval
belligerent
the
pacific
presidential
administration
of
jefferson
sought
by
trade
restrictions
using
embargo
and
acts
to
bring
pressure
on
both
england
and
france
hoping
to
force
a
better
treatment
of
neutrals
the
united
states
divided
in
sympathy
between
the
belligerents
came
near
to
disorder
and
disruption
at
home
over
the
question
of
foreign
policy
but
through
all
american
factions
there
ran
the
feeling
of
growing
animosity
to
great
britain
because
of
impressment
at
last
war
was
declared
by
america
in
and
though
at
the
moment
bitterly
opposed
by
one
section
new
england
that
war
later
came
to
be
regarded
as
of
great
national
value
as
one
of
the
factors
which
welded
the
discordant
states
into
a
national
unity
naturally
also
the
war
once
ended
its
commercial
causes
were
quickly
forgotten
whereas
the
individual
personal
offence
involved
in
impressment
and
right
of
search
with
its
insult
to
national
pride
became
a
patriotic
theme
for
politicians
and
for
the
press
to
deny
in
fact
a
british
right
of
search
became
a
national
point
of
honour
upon
which
no
american
statesman
would
have
dared
to
yield
to
british
overtures
in
american
eyes
the
war
of
appears
as
a
second
war
of
independence
and
also
as
of
international
importance
in
contesting
an
unjust
use
by
britain
of
her
control
of
the
seas
also
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
no
other
war
of
importance
was
fought
by
america
until
the
mexican
war
of
and
militant
patriotism
was
thus
centred
on
the
two
wars
fought
against
great
britain
the
contemporary
british
view
was
that
of
a
nation
involved
in
a
life
and
death
struggle
with
a
great
european
enemy
irritated
by
what
seemed
captious
claims
developed
to
war
by
a
minor
power
to
be
sure
there
were
a
few
obstinate
tories
in
britain
who
saw
in
the
war
the
opportunity
of
smashing
at
one
blow
napoleon
dream
of
empire
and
the
american
democratic
system
the
london
urged
the
government
to
finish
with
bonaparte
and
then
deal
with
madison
and
democracy
arguing
that
it
should
be
england
object
to
subvert
the
whole
system
of
the
jeffersonian
school
but
this
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
british
government
nor
would
such
a
purpose
have
been
tolerated
by
the
small
but
vigorous
whig
minority
in
parliament
the
peace
of
signed
at
ghent
merely
declared
an
end
of
the
war
quietly
ignoring
all
the
alleged
causes
of
the
conflict
impressment
was
not
mentioned
but
it
was
never
again
resorted
to
by
great
britain
upon
american
ships
but
the
principle
of
right
of
search
in
time
of
peace
though
for
another
object
than
impressment
was
soon
again
asserted
by
great
britain
and
for
forty
years
was
a
cause
of
constant
irritation
and
a
source
of
danger
in
the
relations
of
the
two
countries
stirred
by
philanthropic
emotion
great
britain
entered
upon
a
world
crusade
for
the
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
all
nations
in
principle
repudiated
that
trade
and
britain
made
treaties
with
various
maritime
powers
giving
mutual
right
of
search
to
the
naval
vessels
of
each
upon
the
others
merchant
vessels
the
african
slave
trade
was
in
fact
outlawed
for
the
flags
of
all
nations
but
america
smarting
under
the
memory
of
impressment
injuries
and
maintaining
in
any
case
the
doctrine
that
in
time
of
peace
the
national
flag
protected
a
vessel
from
interference
or
search
by
the
naval
vessels
of
any
other
power
refused
to
sign
mutual
right
of
search
treaties
and
denied
absolutely
such
a
right
for
any
cause
whatever
to
great
britain
or
to
any
other
nation
being
refused
a
treaty
britain
merely
renewed
her
assertion
of
the
right
and
continued
to
exercise
it
thus
the
right
of
search
in
time
of
peace
controversy
was
not
ended
with
the
war
of
but
remained
a
constant
sore
in
national
relations
for
britain
alone
used
her
navy
with
energy
to
suppress
the
slave
trade
and
the
slave
traders
of
all
nations
sought
refuge
when
approached
by
a
british
naval
vessel
under
the
protection
of
the
american
flag
if
britain
respected
the
flag
and
sheered
off
from
search
how
could
she
stop
the
trade
if
she
ignored
the
flag
and
on
boarding
found
an
innocent
american
vessel
engaged
in
legal
trade
there
resulted
claims
for
damages
by
detention
of
voyage
and
demands
by
the
american
government
for
apology
and
reparation
the
real
slave
trader
seized
under
the
american
flag
never
protested
to
the
united
states
nor
claimed
american
citizenship
for
his
punishment
in
american
law
for
engaging
in
the
slave
trade
was
death
while
under
the
law
of
any
other
nation
it
did
not
exceed
imprisonment
fine
and
loss
of
his
vessel
summed
up
in
terms
of
governmental
attitude
the
british
contention
was
that
here
was
a
great
international
humanitarian
object
frustrated
by
an
absurd
american
sensitiveness
on
a
point
of
honour
about
the
flag
after
fifteen
years
of
dispute
great
britain
offered
to
abandon
any
claim
to
a
right
of
contenting
herself
with
a
right
of
merely
to
verify
a
vessel
right
to
fly
the
american
flag
america
asserted
this
to
be
mere
pretence
involving
no
renunciation
of
a
practice
whose
legality
she
denied
in
in
the
treaty
settling
the
maine
boundary
controversy
the
eighth
article
sought
a
method
of
escape
joint
cruising
squadrons
were
provided
for
the
coast
of
africa
the
british
to
search
all
suspected
vessels
except
those
flying
the
american
flag
and
these
to
be
searched
by
the
american
squadron
at
once
president
tyler
notified
congress
that
great
britain
had
renounced
the
right
of
search
immediately
in
parliament
a
clamour
was
raised
against
the
government
for
the
sacrifice
of
a
british
right
at
sea
and
lord
aberdeen
promptly
made
official
disclaimer
of
such
surrender
thus
heritage
of
the
war
of
right
of
search
in
time
of
peace
was
a
steady
irritant
america
doubted
somewhat
the
honesty
of
great
britain
appreciating
in
part
the
humanitarian
purpose
but
suspicious
of
an
ulterior
will
to
rule
the
seas
after
no
american
political
leader
would
have
dared
to
yield
the
right
of
search
great
britain
for
her
part
viewing
the
expansion
of
domestic
slavery
in
the
united
states
came
gradually
to
attribute
the
american
contention
not
to
patriotic
pride
but
to
the
selfish
business
interests
of
the
states
in
the
end
in
with
a
waning
british
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
of
slave
trade
suppression
and
with
recognition
that
america
had
become
a
great
world
power
britain
yielded
her
claim
to
right
of
search
or
visit
save
when
established
by
treaty
four
years
later
in
it
may
well
have
seemed
to
british
statesmen
that
american
slavery
had
indeed
been
the
basic
cause
of
attitude
for
in
that
year
a
treaty
was
signed
by
the
two
nations
giving
mutual
right
of
search
for
the
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
in
fact
however
this
was
but
an
effort
by
seward
secretary
of
state
for
the
north
to
influence
british
and
european
opinion
against
the
seceding
slave
states
of
the
south
the
right
of
search
controversy
was
in
truth
ended
when
american
power
reached
a
point
where
the
british
government
must
take
it
seriously
into
account
as
a
factor
in
general
world
policy
that
power
had
been
steadily
and
rapidly
advancing
since
from
almost
the
first
moment
of
established
independence
american
statesmen
visualized
the
separation
of
the
interests
of
the
western
continent
from
those
of
europe
and
planned
for
american
leadership
in
this
new
world
washington
the
first
president
emphasized
in
his
farewell
address
the
danger
of
entangling
alliances
with
europe
for
long
the
nations
of
europe
immersed
in
continental
wars
put
aside
their
rivalries
in
this
new
world
britain
for
a
time
neglected
colonial
expansion
westward
but
in
in
an
emergency
of
european
origin
when
france
commissioned
by
the
great
powers
of
continental
europe
intervened
in
spain
to
restore
the
deposed
bourbon
monarchy
and
seemed
about
to
intervene
in
spanish
america
to
restore
to
spain
her
revolted
colonies
there
developed
in
great
britain
a
policy
seemingly
about
to
draw
america
and
england
into
closer
canning
for
britain
proposed
to
america
a
joint
declaration
against
french
intervention
in
the
americas
his
argument
was
against
the
principle
of
intervention
his
immediate
motive
was
a
fear
of
french
colonial
expansion
but
his
ultimate
object
was
inheritance
by
britain
of
spain
dying
influence
and
position
in
the
new
world
canning
overture
was
earnestly
considered
in
america
the
jefferson
and
madison
recommended
its
acceptance
but
the
secretary
of
state
john
quincy
adams
opposed
this
favouring
rather
a
separate
declaration
by
the
united
states
and
of
this
opinion
was
also
president
monroe
thus
arose
the
monroe
doctrine
announcing
american
opposition
to
the
principle
of
intervention
and
declaring
that
the
american
continents
were
no
longer
to
be
regarded
as
open
to
further
colonization
by
european
nations
the
british
emergency
situation
with
france
though
already
quieted
caused
monroe
message
to
be
greeted
in
england
with
high
approval
but
canning
did
not
so
approve
it
for
he
saw
clearly
that
the
monroe
doctrine
was
a
challenge
not
merely
to
continental
europe
but
to
england
as
well
and
he
set
himself
to
thwart
this
threatening
american
policy
had
canning
policy
been
followed
by
later
british
statesmen
there
would
have
resulted
a
serious
clash
with
the
united
states
in
fact
the
monroe
doctrine
imposing
on
europe
a
policy
of
expansion
toward
the
west
provided
for
the
united
states
the
medium
if
she
wished
to
use
it
for
her
own
expansion
in
territory
and
in
influence
but
for
a
time
there
was
no
need
of
additional
territory
for
that
already
hers
stretched
from
the
atlantic
to
the
rocky
mountains
of
the
way
from
ocean
to
ocean
her
population
was
growing
fast
but
four
millions
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
there
were
thirteen
millions
in
and
of
these
nearly
a
third
were
already
across
the
appalachian
range
and
were
constantly
pressing
on
towards
new
lands
in
the
south
and
west
the
monroe
doctrine
was
the
first
definite
notice
given
to
europe
of
america
preconceived
destiny
but
the
earlier
realization
of
that
destiny
took
place
on
lines
of
expansion
within
her
own
boundaries
to
this
there
could
be
no
governmental
objection
whether
by
great
britain
or
any
other
nation
but
when
in
the
decade
to
the
united
states
to
the
view
of
british
statesmen
suddenly
startled
the
world
by
entering
upon
a
policy
of
further
territorial
expansion
forsaking
her
peaceful
progress
and
turning
toward
war
there
was
a
quick
determination
on
a
line
of
british
policy
as
regards
the
american
advance
the
first
intimation
of
the
new
american
policy
came
in
relation
to
the
state
of
texas
which
had
revolted
from
mexico
in
and
whose
independence
had
been
generally
recognized
by
to
this
new
state
britain
sent
diplomatic
and
consular
agents
and
these
reported
two
factions
among
the
people
one
seeking
admission
to
the
american
union
one
desiring
the
maintenance
of
independence
in
aberdeen
had
sent
lord
ashburton
to
america
with
instructions
to
secure
if
possible
a
settlement
of
all
matters
in
dispute
here
was
a
genuine
british
effort
to
escape
from
national
irritations
but
before
the
treaty
of
was
signed
even
while
it
was
in
the
earlier
stages
of
negotiation
the
british
government
saw
with
alarm
quite
new
questions
arising
preventing
to
its
view
that
harmonious
relation
with
the
united
states
the
desire
for
which
had
led
to
the
ashburton
mission
this
new
development
was
the
appearance
of
an
american
fever
for
territorial
expansion
turning
first
toward
texas
but
soon
voiced
as
a
manifest
destiny
which
should
carry
american
power
and
institutions
to
the
pacific
and
even
into
central
america
among
these
institutions
was
that
of
slavery
detested
by
the
public
of
great
britain
yet
a
delicate
matter
for
governmental
consideration
since
the
great
cotton
manufacturing
interests
drew
the
bulk
of
their
supplies
of
raw
cotton
from
the
states
of
america
if
texas
herself
a
cotton
state
should
join
the
united
states
dependence
upon
cotton
would
be
intensified
also
texas
once
acquired
what
was
there
to
prevent
further
american
exploitation
followed
by
slave
expansion
into
mexico
where
for
long
british
influence
had
been
dominant
on
the
fate
of
texas
therefore
centred
for
a
time
the
whole
british
policy
toward
america
pakenham
the
british
minister
to
mexico
urged
a
british
pressure
on
mexico
to
forgo
her
plans
of
reconquering
texas
and
strong
british
efforts
to
encourage
texas
in
maintaining
her
independence
his
theory
foreshadowed
a
powerful
buffer
state
prohibiting
american
advance
to
the
releasing
britain
from
dependence
on
american
cotton
and
ultimately
he
hoped
leading
texas
to
abolish
slavery
not
yet
so
rooted
as
to
be
ineradicable
this
policy
was
approved
by
the
british
government
pakenham
was
sent
to
washington
to
watch
events
a
elliot
was
despatched
to
texas
and
from
london
lines
were
cast
to
draw
france
into
the
plan
and
to
force
the
acquiescence
of
mexico
in
this
brief
account
of
main
lines
of
governmental
contacts
it
is
unnecessary
to
recite
the
details
of
the
diplomatic
conflict
for
such
it
became
with
sharp
antagonisms
manifested
on
both
sides
the
basic
fact
was
that
america
was
bent
upon
territorial
expansion
and
that
great
britain
set
herself
to
thwart
this
ambition
but
not
to
the
point
of
war
aberdeen
was
so
incautious
at
one
moment
as
to
propose
to
france
and
mexico
a
triple
guarantee
of
the
independence
of
texas
if
that
state
would
acquiesce
but
when
pakenham
notified
him
that
in
this
case
britain
must
clearly
understand
that
war
with
america
was
not
merely
possible
but
probable
aberdeen
hastened
to
withdraw
the
plan
of
guarantee
fortunately
not
yet
approved
by
mexico
the
solution
of
this
diplomatic
contest
thus
rested
with
texas
did
she
wish
annexation
to
the
united
states
or
did
she
prefer
independence
elliot
in
texas
hoped
to
the
last
moment
that
texas
would
choose
independence
and
british
favour
but
the
people
of
the
new
state
were
largely
emigrants
from
the
united
states
and
a
majority
of
them
wished
to
the
union
a
step
finally
accomplished
in
after
ten
years
of
separate
existence
as
a
republic
the
part
played
by
the
british
government
in
this
whole
episode
was
not
a
fortunate
one
it
is
the
duty
of
governments
to
watch
over
the
interests
of
their
subjects
and
to
guard
the
prestige
and
power
of
the
state
great
britain
had
a
perfect
to
take
whatever
steps
she
chose
to
take
in
regard
to
texas
but
the
steps
taken
appeared
to
americans
to
be
based
upon
a
policy
antagonistic
to
the
american
expansion
policy
of
the
moment
the
government
of
great
britain
appeared
indeed
to
have
adopted
a
policy
of
preventing
the
development
of
the
power
of
the
united
states
then
fronted
with
war
she
had
meekly
withdrawn
the
basic
british
public
feeling
fixing
the
limits
of
governmental
policy
of
never
again
being
drawn
into
war
with
america
not
because
of
fear
but
because
of
important
trade
relations
and
also
because
of
essential
liking
and
admiration
in
spite
of
surface
antagonisms
was
not
appreciated
in
america
lord
aberdeen
indeed
and
others
in
governmental
circles
pleaded
that
the
support
of
texan
independence
was
in
reality
perfectly
in
harmony
with
the
best
interests
of
the
united
states
since
it
would
have
tended
toward
the
limitation
of
american
slavery
and
in
the
matter
of
national
power
they
consoled
themselves
with
prophecies
that
the
american
union
now
so
swollen
in
size
must
inevitably
split
into
two
perhaps
three
rival
empires
a
one
in
the
south
free
nations
in
north
and
west
the
fate
of
texas
sealed
britain
soon
definitely
abandoned
all
opposition
to
american
expansion
unless
it
were
to
be
attempted
northwards
though
prophesying
evil
for
the
american
madness
mexico
relying
on
past
favours
and
because
of
a
sharp
controversy
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
over
the
oregon
territory
expected
british
aid
in
her
war
of
against
america
but
she
was
sharply
warned
that
such
aid
would
not
be
given
and
the
oregon
dispute
was
settled
in
the
fashion
of
vigorous
legal
argument
followed
by
a
fair
compromise
the
mexican
war
resulted
in
the
acquisition
of
california
by
the
united
states
british
agents
in
this
province
of
mexico
and
british
admirals
on
the
pacific
were
cautioned
to
take
no
active
steps
in
opposition
thus
british
policy
after
texan
annexation
offered
no
barrier
to
american
expansion
and
much
to
british
relief
the
fear
of
the
extension
of
the
american
plans
to
mexico
and
central
america
was
not
realized
the
united
states
was
soon
plunged
as
british
statesmen
had
prophesied
into
internal
conflict
over
the
question
whether
the
territories
should
be
slave
or
free
the
acquisition
of
california
brought
up
a
new
problem
of
quick
transit
between
atlantic
and
pacific
and
a
canal
was
planned
across
central
america
here
britain
and
america
acted
together
at
first
in
amity
though
the
convention
signed
in
later
developed
discord
as
to
the
british
claim
of
a
protectorate
over
the
atlantic
end
of
the
proposed
canal
at
san
juan
del
nicaragua
but
britain
was
again
at
war
in
europe
in
the
middle
and
america
was
deep
in
quarrel
over
slavery
at
home
on
both
sides
in
spite
of
much
diplomatic
intrigue
and
of
manifestations
of
national
pride
there
was
governmental
desire
to
avoid
difficulties
at
the
end
of
the
period
britain
ceded
to
nicaragua
her
protectorate
in
the
canal
zone
and
all
causes
of
friction
so
reported
president
buchanan
to
congress
in
were
happily
removed
britain
definitely
altered
her
policy
of
opposition
to
the
growth
of
american
power
in
then
the
causes
of
governmental
antagonisms
were
seemingly
all
at
an
end
impressment
was
not
used
after
the
differing
theories
of
the
two
governments
on
british
expatriation
still
remained
but
britain
attempted
no
practical
application
of
her
view
the
right
of
search
in
time
of
peace
controversy
first
eased
by
the
plan
of
joint
cruising
had
been
definitely
settled
by
the
british
renunciation
of
opposition
to
american
territorial
advance
but
briefly
manifested
by
britain
had
ended
with
the
annexation
of
texas
and
the
fever
of
expansion
had
waned
in
america
minor
disputes
in
central
america
related
to
the
proposed
canal
were
amicably
adjusted
but
differences
between
nations
varying
of
peoples
frequently
have
deeper
currents
than
the
more
obvious
frictions
in
governmental
act
or
policy
nor
can
governments
themselves
fail
to
react
to
such
less
evident
causes
it
is
necessary
to
review
the
commercial
relations
of
the
two
nations
later
to
examine
their
political
ideals
in
america
won
her
independence
in
government
from
a
colonial
status
but
commercially
she
remained
a
british
colony
yet
with
a
difference
she
had
formed
a
part
of
the
british
colonial
system
all
her
normal
trade
was
with
the
mother
country
or
with
other
british
colonies
now
her
privileges
in
such
trade
were
at
an
end
and
she
must
seek
as
a
favour
that
which
had
formerly
been
hers
as
a
member
of
the
british
empire
the
direct
trade
between
england
and
america
was
easily
and
quickly
resumed
for
the
commercial
classes
of
both
nations
desired
it
and
profited
by
it
but
the
british
colonial
system
prohibited
trade
between
a
foreign
state
and
british
colonies
and
there
was
one
channel
of
trade
to
and
from
the
british
west
indies
long
very
profitable
to
both
sides
during
colonial
times
but
now
legally
hampered
by
american
independence
the
new
england
states
had
lumber
fish
and
farm
products
desired
by
the
west
indian
planters
and
these
in
turn
offered
needed
sugar
molasses
and
rum
both
parties
desired
to
restore
the
trade
and
in
spite
of
the
legal
restrictions
of
the
colonial
system
the
trade
was
in
fact
resumed
in
part
and
either
permitted
or
winked
at
by
the
british
government
but
never
to
the
advantageous
exchange
of
former
times
the
acute
stage
of
controversy
over
west
indian
trade
was
not
reached
until
some
thirty
years
after
american
independence
but
the
uncertainty
of
such
trade
during
a
long
period
in
which
a
portion
of
it
consisted
in
unauthorized
and
unregulated
exchange
was
a
constant
irritant
to
all
parties
concerned
meanwhile
there
came
the
war
of
with
its
preliminary
check
upon
direct
trade
to
and
from
great
britain
and
its
final
total
prohibition
of
intercourse
during
the
war
itself
in
the
bulk
of
american
importation
of
manufactures
still
came
from
great
britain
in
the
contest
over
neutral
rights
and
theories
jefferson
attempted
to
bring
pressure
on
the
belligerents
and
especially
on
england
by
restriction
of
imports
first
came
a
act
followed
by
an
embargo
on
exports
but
these
were
so
unpopular
in
the
commercial
states
of
new
england
that
they
were
withdrawn
in
yet
for
a
short
time
only
for
napoleon
tricked
the
united
states
into
believing
that
france
had
yielded
to
american
contentions
on
neutral
rights
and
in
was
proclaimed
again
with
england
alone
on
june
america
finally
declared
war
and
trade
stopped
save
in
a
few
new
england
ports
where
rebellious
citizens
continued
to
sell
provisions
to
a
blockading
british
naval
squadron
for
eight
years
after
then
trade
with
great
britain
had
steadily
decreased
finally
almost
to
extinction
during
the
war
but
america
required
certain
articles
customarily
imported
and
necessity
now
forced
her
to
develop
her
own
manufactures
new
england
had
been
the
centre
of
american
foreign
commerce
but
now
there
began
a
trend
toward
manufacturing
enterprise
even
in
however
at
the
end
of
the
war
it
was
still
thought
in
the
united
states
that
under
normal
conditions
manufactured
goods
would
again
be
imported
and
the
general
cry
of
protection
for
home
industries
was
as
yet
unvoiced
nevertheless
a
group
of
infant
industries
had
in
fact
been
started
and
clamoured
for
defence
now
that
peace
was
restored
this
situation
was
not
unnoticed
in
great
britain
where
merchants
piling
up
goods
in
anticipation
of
peace
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
a
restored
market
suddenly
discovered
that
the
poverty
of
europe
denied
them
that
market
looking
with
apprehension
toward
the
new
industries
of
america
british
merchants
following
the
advice
of
lord
brougham
in
a
parliamentary
speech
dumped
great
quantities
of
their
surplus
goods
on
the
american
market
selling
them
far
below
cost
or
even
on
extravagant
credit
terms
one
object
was
to
smash
the
budding
american
manufactures
this
action
of
british
merchants
naturally
stirred
some
angry
patriotic
emotions
in
the
circles
where
american
business
suffered
and
a
demand
began
to
be
heard
for
protection
but
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
still
representative
of
agriculture
in
the
main
and
while
a
tariff
bill
was
enacted
in
that
bill
was
regarded
as
a
temporary
measure
required
by
the
necessity
of
paying
the
costs
of
the
recent
war
just
at
this
juncture
however
british
policy
now
looking
again
toward
a
great
colonial
empire
sought
advantages
for
the
hitherto
neglected
maritime
provinces
of
british
north
america
and
thought
that
it
had
found
them
by
encouragement
of
their
trade
with
the
british
west
indies
the
legal
status
of
american
trade
with
the
west
indies
was
now
enforced
and
for
a
time
intercourse
was
practically
suspended
this
british
policy
brought
to
the
front
the
issue
of
protection
in
america
it
not
only
worked
against
a
return
by
new
england
from
manufacturing
to
commerce
but
it
soon
brought
into
the
ranks
of
protectionists
a
northern
and
western
agricultural
element
that
had
been
accustomed
to
sell
surplus
products
to
west
indian
planters
seeking
cheap
for
their
slaves
this
new
protectionist
element
was
as
yet
not
crystallized
into
a
clamour
for
home
markets
for
agriculture
but
the
pressure
of
opinion
was
beginning
to
be
felt
and
by
the
question
of
west
indian
trade
became
one
of
constant
agitation
and
demanded
political
action
that
action
was
taken
on
lines
of
retaliation
congress
in
passed
a
law
excluding
from
american
ports
any
british
vessel
coming
from
a
port
access
to
which
was
denied
to
an
american
vessel
and
placing
under
bond
in
american
ports
british
vessels
with
prohibition
of
their
proceeding
to
a
british
port
to
which
american
vessels
could
not
go
this
act
affected
not
merely
direct
trade
with
the
west
indies
but
stopped
the
general
custom
of
british
ships
of
taking
part
cargoes
to
jamaica
while
to
and
from
the
united
states
the
result
was
first
compromise
later
under
administration
at
the
british
board
of
trade
complete
abandonment
by
britain
of
the
exclusive
trade
basis
of
her
whole
colonial
system
the
retaliatory
system
which
adams
regarded
as
a
new
declaration
of
independence
was
in
fact
quickly
taken
up
by
other
nations
and
these
with
america
compelled
great
britain
to
take
stock
of
her
interests
huskisson
rightly
foreseeing
british
prosperity
as
dependent
upon
her
manufactures
and
upon
the
carrying
trade
stated
in
parliament
that
american
retaliation
had
forced
the
issue
freedom
of
trade
in
british
ports
was
offered
in
to
all
nations
that
would
open
their
ports
within
one
year
on
terms
of
equality
to
british
ships
adams
now
president
of
the
united
states
delayed
acceptance
of
this
offer
preferring
a
treaty
negotiation
and
was
rebuffed
by
canning
so
that
actual
resumption
of
west
indian
trade
did
not
take
place
until
after
the
close
of
adams
administration
that
trade
never
recovered
its
former
prosperity
meanwhile
the
long
period
of
controversy
from
to
had
resulted
in
a
complete
change
in
the
american
situation
it
is
not
a
sufficient
explanation
of
the
american
belief
in
and
practice
of
the
theory
of
protection
to
attribute
this
alone
to
british
checks
placed
upon
free
commercial
rivalry
nevertheless
the
progress
of
america
toward
an
established
system
reaching
its
highest
mark
for
years
in
the
tariff
bill
of
is
distinctly
related
to
the
events
just
narrated
after
american
independence
the
partially
illegal
status
of
west
indian
trade
hampered
commercial
progress
and
slightly
encouraged
american
manufactures
by
the
mere
seeking
of
capital
for
investment
the
neutral
troubles
of
and
the
american
prohibitions
on
intercourse
increased
the
transfer
of
interest
the
war
of
gave
a
complete
protection
to
infant
industries
the
dumping
of
british
goods
in
stirred
patriotic
american
feeling
british
renewal
of
colonial
system
restrictions
and
the
quarrel
over
retaliation
gave
time
for
the
definite
establishment
of
protectionist
ideas
in
the
united
states
but
britain
was
soon
proclaiming
for
herself
and
for
the
world
the
common
advantage
and
the
justice
of
a
great
theory
of
free
trade
america
was
apparently
now
committed
to
an
opposing
economic
theory
the
first
great
nation
definitely
to
establish
it
and
thus
there
resulted
a
opposition
of
principle
and
a
clash
of
interests
from
when
free
trade
ideas
triumphed
in
england
the
devoted
british
free
trader
regarded
america
as
the
chief
obstacle
to
a
acceptance
of
his
theory
the
one
bright
spot
in
america
as
regarded
by
the
british
free
trader
was
in
the
southern
states
where
cotton
interests
desiring
no
advantage
from
protection
since
their
market
was
in
europe
attacked
american
protection
and
sought
to
escape
from
it
also
slave
supplies
without
protection
could
have
been
purchased
more
cheaply
from
england
than
from
the
manufacturing
north
in
indeed
the
south
had
forced
a
reaction
against
protection
but
it
proceeded
slowly
in
it
was
southern
opinion
that
carried
through
congress
the
reciprocity
treaty
with
the
british
american
provinces
partly
brought
about
no
doubt
by
a
southern
fear
that
canada
bitter
over
the
loss
of
special
advantages
in
british
markets
by
the
british
free
trade
of
might
join
the
united
states
and
thus
swell
the
northern
and
free
states
of
the
union
cotton
interests
and
trade
became
the
dominant
british
commercial
tie
with
the
united
states
and
the
one
great
hope
to
the
british
minds
of
a
break
in
the
false
american
system
of
protection
thus
both
in
economic
theory
and
in
trade
spite
of
british
dislike
of
slavery
the
export
trading
interests
of
great
britain
became
more
and
more
directed
toward
the
southern
states
of
america
adding
powerfully
to
this
was
the
dependence
of
british
cotton
manufactures
upon
the
american
supply
the
british
trade
attitude
arising
largely
outside
of
direct
governmental
contacts
was
bound
to
have
nevertheless
a
constant
and
important
influence
on
governmental
action
governmental
policy
seeking
national
power
conflicting
trade
and
industrial
interests
are
the
favourite
themes
of
those
historians
who
regard
nations
as
determined
in
their
relations
solely
by
economic
causes
by
what
is
called
enlightened
but
governments
no
matter
how
arbitrary
and
still
more
if
in
a
measure
resting
on
representation
react
both
consciously
and
unconsciously
to
a
public
opinion
not
obviously
based
upon
either
national
or
commercial
rivalry
sometimes
indeed
governmental
attitude
runs
absolutely
counter
to
popular
attitude
in
international
affairs
in
such
a
case
the
historical
estimate
if
based
solely
on
evidences
of
governmental
action
is
a
false
one
and
may
do
great
injustice
to
the
essential
friendliness
of
a
people
how
then
did
the
british
people
of
all
classes
regard
america
before
and
in
what
manner
did
that
regard
affect
the
british
government
here
it
is
necessary
to
seek
british
opinion
on
and
its
reaction
to
american
institutions
ideals
and
practices
such
public
opinion
can
be
found
in
quantity
sufficient
to
base
an
estimate
only
in
books
in
reviews
and
in
newspapers
of
the
period
when
all
these
are
brought
together
it
is
found
that
while
there
was
an
almost
universal
british
criticism
of
american
social
customs
and
habits
of
life
due
to
that
insularity
of
mental
attitude
characteristic
of
every
nation
making
it
prefer
its
own
customs
and
criticize
those
of
its
neighbours
summed
up
in
the
phrase
dislike
of
foreigners
it
is
found
that
british
opinion
was
centred
upon
two
main
threads
first
america
as
a
place
for
emigration
and
second
american
political
ideals
and
institutions
british
emigration
to
america
a
governmentally
favoured
colonization
process
before
the
american
revolution
lost
that
favour
after
though
not
at
first
definitely
opposed
but
emigration
still
continued
and
at
no
time
save
during
the
war
of
was
it
absolutely
stopped
its
exact
amount
is
unascertainable
for
neither
government
kept
adequate
statistics
before
with
the
end
of
the
napoleonic
wars
there
came
great
distress
in
england
from
which
the
man
of
energy
sought
escape
he
turned
naturally
to
america
being
familiar
by
hearsay
at
least
with
stories
of
the
ease
of
gaining
a
livelihood
there
and
influenced
by
the
knowledge
that
in
the
united
states
he
would
find
people
of
his
own
blood
and
speech
the
bulk
of
this
earlier
emigration
to
america
resulted
from
economic
causes
when
in
one
energetic
member
of
parliament
wilmot
horton
induced
the
government
to
appoint
a
committee
to
investigate
the
whole
subject
the
result
was
a
mass
of
testimony
secured
from
returned
emigrants
or
from
their
letters
home
in
which
there
constantly
appeared
one
main
argument
influencing
the
labourer
type
of
emigrant
he
got
good
wages
and
he
was
supplied
as
a
farm
hand
with
good
food
repeatedly
he
testifies
that
he
had
three
meat
meals
a
day
whereas
in
england
he
had
ordinarily
received
but
one
such
meal
a
week
mere
good
living
was
the
chief
inducement
for
the
labourer
type
of
emigrant
and
the
knowledge
of
such
living
created
for
this
type
remaining
in
england
a
sort
of
halo
of
industrial
prosperity
surrounding
america
but
there
was
a
second
testimony
brought
out
by
committee
less
general
yet
to
be
picked
up
here
and
there
as
evidence
of
another
argument
for
emigration
to
america
the
labourer
did
not
dilate
upon
political
equality
nor
boast
of
a
share
in
government
indeed
generally
had
no
such
share
but
he
did
boast
to
his
fellows
at
home
of
the
social
equality
though
not
thus
expressing
it
which
was
all
about
him
he
was
a
common
farm
hand
yet
he
sat
down
to
meals
with
his
employer
and
family
and
worked
in
the
fields
side
by
side
with
his
master
this
too
was
an
astounding
difference
to
the
mind
of
the
british
labourer
probably
for
him
it
created
a
clearer
if
not
altogether
universal
and
true
picture
of
the
meaning
of
american
democracy
than
would
have
volumes
of
writing
upon
political
institutions
gradually
there
was
established
in
the
lower
orders
of
british
society
a
visualization
of
america
as
a
haven
of
physical
and
personal
social
happiness
this
british
labouring
class
had
for
long
however
no
medium
of
expression
in
print
here
existed
then
an
unexpressed
public
opinion
of
america
of
much
latent
influence
but
for
the
moment
largely
negligible
as
affecting
other
classes
or
the
government
a
more
important
emigrating
class
in
its
influence
on
opinion
at
home
though
not
a
large
class
was
composed
about
equally
of
small
farmers
and
small
merchants
facing
ruin
in
the
agricultural
and
trading
crises
that
followed
the
end
of
the
european
war
the
british
travellers
books
from
to
are
generally
written
by
men
of
this
class
or
by
agents
sent
out
from
groups
planning
emigration
generally
they
were
discontented
with
political
conditions
at
home
commonly
opposed
to
a
petrified
social
order
and
attracted
to
the
united
states
by
its
lure
of
prosperity
and
content
the
books
are
in
brief
a
superior
type
of
emigrant
guide
for
a
superior
type
of
emigrant
examining
and
emphasizing
industrial
opportunity
almost
universally
however
they
sound
the
note
of
superior
political
institutions
and
conditions
one
wrote
a
republican
finds
here
a
republic
and
the
only
republic
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
ever
deserved
the
name
where
all
are
under
the
protection
of
equal
laws
of
laws
made
by
themselves
another
who
established
an
english
colony
in
the
western

who

consisted

thus
a

an

or
a

from
the
first
days
of
the
american
colonial
movement
toward
independence
there
had
been
indeed
a
british
interest
in
american
political
principles
many
whigs
sympathized
with
these
principles
for
reasons
of
home
political
controversy
their
sympathy
continued
after
american
independence
and
by
its
insistent
expression
brought
out
equally
insistent
opposition
from
tory
circles
the
british
home
movement
toward
a
more
representative
government
had
been
temporarily
checked
by
the
extremes
into
which
french
liberalism
plunged
in
causing
reaction
in
england
by
pressure
was
again
being
exerted
by
british
liberals
of
intelligence
and
they
found
arguments
in
such
reports
as
those
just
quoted
from
that
date
onward
and
especially
just
before
the
passing
of
the
reform
bill
of
yet
always
a
factor
the
example
of
a
prosperous
american
democracy
was
an
element
in
british
home
politics
lauded
or
derided
as
the
man
in
england
desired
or
not
an
expansion
of
the
british
franchise
in
the
earlier
period
however
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
applause
of
american
institutions
did
not
mean
acceptance
of
democracy
to
the
extent
of
manhood
franchise
for
no
such
franchise
at
first
existed
in
america
itself
the
debate
in
england
was
simply
whether
the
step
forward
in
american
democracy
was
an
argument
for
a
similar
step
in
great
britain
books
reviews
and
newspapers
in
great
britain
as
the
political
quarrel
there
grew
in
force
depicted
america
favourably
or
otherwise
according
to
political
sympathies
at
home
both
before
and
after
the
reform
bill
of
this
type
of
effort
to
mould
opinion
by
citation
of
america
was
widespread
hence
there
is
in
such
writing
not
so
much
the
expression
of
public
opinion
as
of
propaganda
to
affect
that
opinion
book
upon
book
review
upon
review
might
be
quoted
to
illustrate
this
but
a
few
notable
examples
will
suffice
the
most
widely
read
and
reviewed
book
on
the
united
states
before
except
the
humorous
and
flippant
characterization
of
america
by
trollope

published
in
claiming
an
open
mind
he
expected
for
his
adverse
findings
a
readier
credence
for
adverse
to
american
political
institutions
these
findings
are
in
all
their
larger
applications
in
every
line
hall
betrays
himself
as
an
old
tory
of
the
fixed
in
his
belief
and
convinced
of
the
perfection
and
unalterableness
of
the
british
constitution
captain
hamilton
who
wrote
in
was
more
frank
in
avowal
of
a
purpose
he
states
in
his
preface
when
i
found
the
institutions
and
experiences
of
the
united
states
deliberately
quoted
in
the
reformed
parliament
as
affording
safe
precedent
for
british
legislation
and
learned
that
the
drivellers
who
uttered
such
nonsense
instead
of
encountering
merited
derision
were
listened
to
with
patience
and
approbation
by
men
as
ignorant
as
themselves
i
certainly
did
feel
that
another
work
on
america
was
yet
wanted
and
at
once
determined
to
undertake
a
task
which
inferior
considerations
would
probably
have
induced
me
to
decline
harriet
martineau
ardent
advocate
of
political
reform
at

found
in
the
united
states
proofs
for
her
faith
in
democracy
captain
marryat
belittled
miss
martineau
but
in
his
six
volumes
proved
himself
less
a
critic
of
america
than
an
enemy
of
democracy
answering
a
review
of
his
earlier
volumes
published
separately
he
wrote
in
his
concluding
volume
i
candidly
acknowledge
that
the
reviewer
is
right
in
his
supposition
my
great
object
has
been
to
do
serious
injury
to
the
cause
of
democracy
the
fact
was
that
british
governing
and
intellectual
classes
were
suffering
a
recoil
from
the
enthusiasms
leading
up
to
the
step
toward
democracy
in
the
reform
of
the
electoral
franchise
was
still
limited
to
a
small
minority
of
the
population
britain
was
still
ruled
by
her
wise
men
of
wealth
and
position
meanwhile
however
just
at
the
moment
when
dominant
whig
influence
in
england
carried
through
that
step
forward
toward
democratic
institutions
which
whigs
had
long
lauded
in
america
the
latter
country
had
progressed
to
manhood
suffrage
or
as
nearly
all
leading
englishmen
whether
whig
or
tory
regarded
it
had
plunged
into
the
rule
of
the
mob
the
result
was
a
rapid
lessening
in
whig
expression
of
admiration
for
america
even
before
long
to
the
complete
cessation
of
such
admiration
and
to
assertions
in
great
britain
that
the
reform
of
was
final
the
last
step
toward
democracy
which
britain
could
safely
take
it
is
not
strange
that
the
books
and
reviews
of
the
period
from
to
heavily
stress
the
dangers
and
crudity
of
american
democracy
they
were
written
for
what
was
now
a
nearly
unanimous
british
reading
public
fearful
lest
radical
pressure
for
still
further
electoral
reform
should
preach
the
example
of
the
united
states
thus
after
the
previous
sympathy
for
america
of
one
section
of
the
british
governing
class
disappears
more
it
is
replaced
by
a
critical
if
not
openly
hostile
attitude
soon
with
the
rapid
development
of
the
power
and
wealth
of
the
united
states
england
of
all
factions
save
the
radical
came
to
view
america
just
as
it
would
have
viewed
any
other
rising
nation
that
is
as
a
problem
to
be
studied
for
its
influence
on
british
prosperity
and
power
again
expressions
in
print
reflect
the
changes
of
british
view
nowhere
more
clearly
than
in
travellers
books
after
for
nearly
a
decade
these
are
devoted
not
to
american
political
institutions
but
to
studies
many
of
them
very
careful
ones
of
american
industry
and
governmental
policy
buckingham
member
of
parliament
wrote
nine
volumes
of
such
description
his
work
is
a
storehouse
of
fact
useful
to
this
day
to
the
american
historical
student
george

and
phrenologist

especially
social

tour
under
the
guidance
of
the
poet

the
northern

completely
at

with
those
of

and

a

who
came

way
of
canada
an
unusual
approach
were
both
frankly
startled
the
latter
professedly
alarmed
at
the
evidences
of
power
in
america
amazed
at
the
energy
growth
and
prosperity
of
the
country
and
alarmed
at
the
feeling
he
found
in
new
york
city
warburton
wrote
that
they
americans
only
wait
for
matured
power
to
apply
the
incendiary
torch
of
republicanism
to
the
nations
of
europe
soon
after
this
was
written
there
began
in
that
great
tide
of
irish
emigration
to
america
which
heavily
reinforced
the
attitude
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
largely
changed
its
character
did
books
dilating
upon
the
expanding
power
of
america
reflect
british
public
opinion
or
did
they
create
it
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
such
matters
certainly
it
is
not
uninteresting
that
these
books
coincided
in
point
of
time
with
a
british
governmental
attitude
of
opposition
though
on
peaceful
lines
to
the
development
of
american
power
and
to
the
adoption
to
the
point
of
faith
by
british
commercial
classes
of
free
trade
as
opposed
to
the
american
protective
system
but
governing
classes
were
not
the
british
public
and
to
the
great
unenfranchised
mass
finding
voice
through
the
writings
of
a
few
leaders
the
prosperity
of
america
made
a
powerful
appeal
radical
democracy
was
again
beginning
to
make
its
plea
in
britain
in
there
was
published
a
study
of
the
united
states
more
careful
and
exact
than
any
previous
to

and
lauding

this
was
mackay
western
world
and
that
there
was
a
public
eager
for
such
estimate
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
book
went
through
four
british
editions
in
at
the
end
of
the
decade
then
there
appeared
once
more
a
vigorous
champion
of
the
cause
of
british
democracy

the
results
of

the
wise
with
alleged

mackay

from
the
point
to
which

finding
the

of

is
to
this
moment
its
that
which
develops
itself
as
the
sympathy
of

becomes
in
america
the
general
sentiment
of

we
present
an
imposing
front
to
the

but
let
us
tear
the
picture
and
look
at
the
canvas
one
out
of
every

of

a
pauper
every
six
englishmen
have
in
addition
to
their
other
enormous

a
seventh

them
whose
life
is
spent
in
consuming
but
in
adding
nothing
to
the
source
of
their
common
subsistence
british
governing
classes
then
forgoing
after
opposition
to
the
advance
of
american
power
found
themselves
involved
again
as
before
in
the
problem
of
the
possible
influence
of
a
prosperous
american
democracy
upon
an
unenfranchised
public
opinion
at

also
for
all
englishmen
of
whatever
class
in
spite
of
rivalry
in
power
of
opposing
theories
of
trade
of
divergent
political
institutions
there
existed
a
vague
though
influential
pride
in
the
advance
of
a
people
of
similar
race
sprung
from
british
loins
and
there
remained
for
all
englishmen
also
one
puzzling
and
discreditable
american
institution
slavery
held
up
to
scorn
by
the
critics
of
the
united
states
difficult
of
excuse
among
her
friends
agitation
conducted
by
the
great
philanthropist
wilberforce
had
early
committed
british
government
and
people
to
a
crusade
against
the
african
slave
trade
this
british
policy
was
clearly
announced
to
the
world
in
the
negotiations
at
vienna
in
but
britain
herself
still
supported
the
institution
of
slavery
in
her
west
indian
colonies
and
it
was
not
until
british
humanitarian
sentiment
had
forced
emancipation
upon
the
unwilling
sugar
planters
in
that
the
nation
was
morally
free
to
criticize
american
domestic
slavery
meanwhile
great
emancipation
societies
with
many
branches
all
virile
and
active
had
grown
up
in
england
and
in
scotland
these
now
turned
to
an
attack
on
slavery
the
world
over
and
especially
on
american
slavery
the
great
american
abolitionist
garrison
found
more
support
in
england
than
in
his
own
country
his
weekly
paper
is
full
of
messages
of
cheer
from
british
friends
and
societies
and
of
quotations
from
a
sympathetic
though
generally
provincial
british
press
from
to
british
sentiment
was
at
its
height
it
watched
with
anxiety
the
evidence
of
a
developing
struggle
over
slavery
in
the
united
states
hopeful
as
each
crisis
arose
that
the
free
northern
states
would
impose
their
will
upon
the
southern
slave
states
but
as
each
crisis
turned
to
compromise
seemingly
enhancing
the
power
of
the
south
and
committing
america
to
a
retention
of
slavery
the
hopes
of
british
abolitionists
waned
the
north
did
indeed
to
british
opinion
become
identified
with
opposition
to
the
expansion
of
slavery
but
after
the
great
compromise
of
where
the
elder
american
statesmen
of
both
north
and
south
proclaimed
the
finality
of
that
measure
british
sympathy
for
the
north
rapidly
lessened
moreover
after
there
was
in
britain
itself
a
decay
of
general
humanitarian
sentiment
as
regards
slavery
the
crusade
had
begun
to
seem
hopeless
and
the
earlier
vigorous
agitators
were
dead
the
british
government
still
maintained
its
naval
squadron
for
the
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
but
the
british
official
mind
no
longer
keenly
interested
itself
either
in
this
effort
or
in
the
general
question
of
slavery
nevertheless
american
slavery
and
slave
conditions
were
still
after
favourite
matters
for
discussion
almost
universally
critical
by
english
writers
each
renewal
of
the
conflict
in
america
even
though
local
not
national
in
character
drew
out
a
flood
of
comment
in
the
public
press
this
blot
upon
american
civilization
was
a
steady
subject
for
attack
and
that
attack
was
naturally
directed
against
the
south
the
london
in
particular
lost
no
opportunity
of
presenting
the
matter
to
its
readers
in
a

the
height
of
the
border
struggles
there
and

observations

wholly
on
the
side
of
the
northern
settlers
in
kansas
though
not
hopeful
that
the
kansas
struggle
would
expand
to
a
national
conflict
he
constantly
depicted
the

first
knowledge
of
impending
conflict
it
has
been
remarked
by
the
american
historian
schouler
that
immediately
before
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
diplomatic
controversies
between
england
and
america
had
largely
been
settled
and
that
england
pressed
from
point
to
point
had
sullenly
yielded
under
american
demands
this
generalization
as
applied
to
what
were
after
all
minor
controversies
is
in
great
measure
true
in
larger
questions
of
policy
as
regards
spheres
of
influence
or
developing
power
or
principles
of
trade
there
was
difference
but
no
longer
any
essential
opposition
or
declared
rivalry
in
theories
of
government
there
was
sharp
divergence
clearly
appreciated
however
only
in
britain
this
sense
of
divergence
even
of
a
certain
threat
from
america
to
british
political
institutions
united
with
an
established
opinion
that
slavery
was
permanently
fixed
in
the
united
states
to
reinforce
governmental
indifference
sometimes
even
hostility
to
america
the
british
public
also
was
largely
hopeless
of
any
change
in
the
institution
of
slavery
and
its
own
active
humanitarian
interest
was
waning
though
still
dormant
not
dead
yet
the
two
nations
to
a
degree
not
true
of
any
other
two
were
of
the
same
race
had
similar
basic
laws
read
the
same
books
and
were
held
in
close
touch
at
many
points
by
the
steady
flow
of
british
emigration
to
the
united
states
when
after
the
election
of
lincoln
to
the
presidency
in
november
the
of
civil
strife
rapidly
gathered
the
situation
took
both
british
government
and
people
by
surprise
there
was
not
any
clear
understanding
either
of
american
political
conditions
or
of
the
intensity
of
feeling
now
aroused
over
the
question
of
the
extension
of
slave
territory
the
most
recent
descriptions
of
america
had
agreed
in
assertion
that
at
some
future
time
there
would
take
place
in
all
probability
a
dissolution
of
the
union
on
lines
of
diverging
economic
interests
but
also
stated
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
american
situation
to
indicate
immediate
progress
in
this
direction
grattan
a
resident
in

as
british
consul
at
boston
wrote
the
day
must
no
doubt
come
when
clashing
objects
will
break
the
ties
of
common
interest
which
now
preserve
the
union
but
no
man
may
foretell
the
period
of
dissolution
the
many
restraining
causes
are
out
of
sight
of
foreign
observation
the
lilliputian
threads
binding
the
man
mountain
are
invisible
and
it
seems
wondrous
that
each
limb
does
not
act
for
itself
independently
of
its
fellows
a
closer
examination
shows
the
nature
of
the
network
which
keeps
the
members
of
this
association
so
tightly
bound
any
attempt
to
untangle
the
ties
more
firmly
fastens
them
when
any
one
state
talks
of
separation
the
others
become
spontaneously
knotted
together
when
a
section
blusters
about
its
particular
rights
the
rest
feel
each
of
theirs
to
be
common
to
all
if
a
foreign
nation
hint
at
hostility
the
whole
union
becomes
in
reality
united
and
thus
in
every
contingency
from
which
there
can
be
danger
there
is
also
found
the
element
of
safety
yet
he
added
all
attempts
to
strengthen
this
federal
government
at
the
expense
of
the
states
governments
must
be
futile
the
federal
government
exists
on
sufferance
only
any
state
may
at
any
time
constitutionally
withdraw
from
the
union
and
thus
virtually
dissolve
it
even
more
emphatically
though
with
less
authority
wrote
one
charles
mackay
styled
by
the
american
press
as
a
distinguished
british
poet
who
made
the
usual
rapid
tour
of
the
principal
cities
of
america
in
and
as
rapidly
penned
his
impressions
many
persons
in
the
united
states
talk
of
a
dissolution
of
the
union
but
few
believe
in
it
all
this
is
mere
bravado
and
empty
talk
it
means
nothing
the
union
is
dear
to
all
americans
whatever
they
may
say
to
the
contrary
there
is
no
present
danger
to
the
union
and
the
violent
expressions
to
which
politicians
of
the
north
and
south
sometimes
give
vent

no
real
meaning
the
west
as
it
is
fondly
called
is
in
the
position
even
now
to
arbitrate
between
north
and
south
should
the
quarrel
stretch
beyond
words
or
should
or
any
other
question
succeed
in
throwing
any
difference
between
them

it
would
take
revolvers
and
rifles
rather
than
speeches
and
votes
to
put
an
end
to
the
slavery
controversy
in
america
had
in
short
come
to
be
regarded
in
england
as
a
constant
quarrel
between
north
and
south
but
of
no
immediate
danger
to
the
union
each
outbreak
of
violent
american
controversy
produced
a
british
comment
sympathetic
with
the
north
the
turmoil
preceding
and
following
the
election
of
lincoln
in
on
the
platform
of
no
extension
of

was
very
generally
noted
by
the
british
press
and
public
as
a
sign
favourable
to
the

no

the
british

press
in
nearly
every
issue
of
which
for
at
least
two
years
after

there
appeared
news
items
and
editorial
comment
on
the
american
crisis
was
at
first
nearly
unanimous
in
condemning
the
south

with
accustomed
vigour
led
the
field
on
november
it
stated
when
we
read
the
speech
of
lincoln
on
the
subject
of
slavery
and
consider
the
extreme
moderation
of
the
sentiments
it
expresses
the
allowance
that
is
made
for
the
situation
for
the
feelings
for
the
prejudices
of
the
south
when
we
see
how
entirely
he
narrows
his
opposition
to
the
single
point
of
the
admission
of
slavery
into
the
territories
we
can
not
help
being
forcibly
struck
by
the
absurdity
of
breaking
up
a
vast
and
glorious
confederacy
like
that
of
the
united
states
from
the
dread
and
anger
inspired
by
the
election
of
such
a
man
to
the
office
of
chief
magistrate
we
rejoice
on
higher
and
surer
grounds
that
it
the
election
has
ended
in
the
return
of
lincoln
we
are
glad
to
think
that
the
march
of
slavery
and
the
domineering
tone
which
its
advocates
were
beginning
to
assume
over
freedom
has
been
at
length
arrested
and
silenced
we
rejoice
that
a
vast
community
of
our
own
race
has
at
length
given
an
authoritative
expression
to
sentiments
which
are
entertained
by
everyone
in
this
country
we
trust
to
see
the
american
government
employed
in
tasks
more
worthy
of
a
state
founded
on
the
doctrines
of
liberty
and
equality
than
the
invention
of
shifts
and
devices
to
perpetuate
servitude
and
we
hear
in
this
great
protest
of
american
freedom
the
tardy
echo
of
those
humane
doctrines
to
which
england
has
so
long
become
a
convert
other
leading
journals
though
with
less
of
patronizing
struck
the
same
note
as
the
the
attributed
lincoln
election
to
a
shift
in
the
sympathies
of
the
lower
orders
in
the
electorate
who
had
now
deserted
their
former
leaders
the
aristocracy
of
the
south
and
allied
themselves
with
the
refined
and
wise
leaders
of
the
north
lincoln
it
argued
was
not
an
extremist
in
any
sense
his
plan
of
action
lay
within
the
limits
of
statesmanlike
moderation
the
was
less
sure
that
england
should
rejoice
with
the
north
british
had
suffered
some
hard
blows
at
the
hands
of
the
democratic
party
in
america
but
at
least
england
knew
where
democrats
stood
and
could
count
on
no
more
discourtesy
or
injustice
than
that
inflicted
in
the
past
the
republican
party
however
had
no
policy
except
that
of
its
leader
seward
and
from
him
might
be
expected
extreme
insolence
this
was
a
very
early
judgment
of
seward
and
one
upon
which
the
preened
itself
later
as
wholly
justified
the
the
only
one
of
the
four
journals
thus
far
considered
which
ultimately
remained
constant
in
advocacy
of
the
northern
cause
was
at
first
lukewarm
in
comment
regarding
the
election
while
fought
on
the
slavery
issue
as
in
reality
a
mere
contest
between
parties
for
political
power
such
was
the
initial
attitude
of
the
english
press
each
press
issue
for
several
weeks
harped
on
the
same
chord
though
sounding
varying
notes
if
the
south
really
means
forcible
resistance
said
the
it
is
doomed
to
quick
suppression
a
few
hundred
thousand
trembling
nightly
with
visions
of
murder
and
pillage
backed
by
a
dissolute
population
of
whites
are
no
match
for
the
hardy
and
resolute
populations
of
the
free
states
and
if
the
south
hoped
for
foreign
aid
it
should
be
undeceived
promptly
can
any
sane
man
believe
that
england
and
france
will
consent
as
is
now
suggested
to
stultify
the
policy
of
half
a
century
for
the
sake
of
an
extended
cotton
trade
and
to
purchase
the
favours
of
charleston
and
milledgeville
by
recognizing
what
has
been
called
isothermal
law
which
impels
african
labour
toward
the
tropics
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
moreover
all
americans
ought
to
understand
clearly
that
british
respect
for
the
united
states
was
not
due
to
the
attitude
of
the
south
with
its
ruffian
demonstrations
in
congress
all
that
is
noble
and
venerable
in
the
united
states
is
associated
with
its
federal
constitution
did
the
british
public
hold
these
same
opinions
there
is
no
direct
evidence
available
in
sufficient
quantity
in
autobiography
or
letters
upon
which
to
base
a
conclusion
such
works
are
silent
on
the
struggle
in
america
for
the
first
few
months
and
presumably
public
opinion
less
informed
even
than
the
press
received
its
impressions
from
the
journals
customarily
read
both
at
this
period
and
all
through
the
war
also
it
should
be
remembered
clearly
that
most
newspapers
all
the
reviews
in
fact
nearly
all
vehicles
of
british
expression
were
in
the
early
in
the
hands
of
the
educated
classes
and
these
educated
classes
corresponded
closely
with
the
privileged
classes
the
more
democratic
element
of
british
society
lacked
any
adequate
press
representation
of
its
opinions
this
body
could
express
itself
by
such
comparatively
crude
methods
as
public
meetings
and
demonstrations
but
it
was
hampered
in
literary
and
political
expression
the
opinion
of
the
press
was
then
presumably
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
educated
british
public
thus
british
comment
on
america
took
the
form
at
first
of
moralizations
now
severe
toward
the
south
now
indifferent
yet
very
generally
asserting
the
essential
justice
of
the
northern
position
but
it
was
early
evident
that
the
newspapers
one
and
all
were
quite
unprepared
for
the
determined
front
soon
put
up
by
south
carolina
and
other
southern
states
surprised
by
the
violence
of
southern
declarations
the
only
explanation
found
by
the
british
press
was
that
political
control
had
been
seized
by
the
uneducated
and
lawless
element
the
characterized
this
element
of
the
south
as
in
a
state
of
deplorable
ignorance
comparable
with
that
of
the
irish
peasantry
a
poor
proud
lazy
excitable
and
violent
class
ever
ready
with
knife
and
revolver
the
fate
of
the
union
according
to
the
was
in
the
hands
of
the
most
ignorant
most
unscrupulous
and
most
lawless
class
in
the
world
the
poor
or
mean
whites
of
the
slave
states
like
judgments
were
expressed
by
the
and
more
mildly
by
the
subsequently
some
of
these
journals
found
difficulty
in
this
connection
in
swinging
round
the
circle
to
expressions
of
admiration
for
the
wise
and
powerful
aristocracy
of
the
south
but
all
especially
the
were
skilled
by
long
practice
in
the
journalistic
art
of
facing
about
while
claiming
perfect
consistency
in
denial
of
a
southern
right
of
secession
also
they
were
nearly
a
unit
though
the
argued
the
case
for
the
south
making
a
pointed
parallel
between
the
present
situation
and
that
of
the
american
colonies
in
seceding
from
england
the
quotations
thus
far
made
exhibit
for
the
leading
papers
an
initial
confusion
and
ignorance
difficult
to
harmonize
with
the
theory
of
an
enlightened
press
the
reviews
by
the
conditions
of
publication
came
into
action
more
slowly
and
during
there
appeared
but
one
article
in
the
giving
any
adequate
idea
of
what
was
really
taking
place
in
america
the
lesser
british
papers
generally
followed
the
tone
of
the
leading
journals
but
without
either
great
interest
or
much
acumen
in
truth
the
depth
of
british
newspaper
ignorance
considering
their
positiveness
of
utterance
appears
utterly
astonishing
if
regarded
from
the
of
modern
historical
knowledge
but
is
this
after
all
a
matter
for
surprise
was
there
not
equal
confusion
at
least
possibly
equal
ignorance
in
america
itself
certainly
among
the
press
and
people
of
the
northern
states
they
also
had
come
by
experience
to
discount
southern
threats
and
were
slow
to
understand
that
the
great
conflict
of
ideals
and
interests
was
at
last
begun
the
british
press
both
influenced
and
reflected
educated
class
opinion
and
in
some
degree
official
opinion
as
well
lord
john
russell
at
the
foreign
office
and
lord
lyons
british
minister
at
washington
were
exchanging
anxious
letters
and
the
latter
was
sending
home
reports
remarkable
for
their
clear
analysis
of
the
american
controversy
yet
even
he
was
slow
to
appreciate
the
inevitability
of

other
officials
especially
those
in
minor
positions
in
the
united
states
showed
a
lack
of
grasp
of
the
situation
similar
to
that
of
the
press
an
amusing
illustration
of
this
furnishing
a
view
of
causes
is
supplied
in
a
letter
of
february
from
consul
bunch
at
charleston
to
lord
lyons
the
british
minister
at
washington
bunch
wrote
describing
a
dinner
which
had
been
given
the
evening
before
by
the
jockey
club
of
charleston
being
called
upon
for
a
speech
he
had
alluded
to
the
prizes
of
the
turf
at
home
and
had
referred
especially
to
the
plates
run
for
the
various
british
colonies
continuing
he
said
i
can
not
help
calling
your
attention
to
the
great
loss
you
yourselves
have
suffered
by
ceasing
to
be
a
colonial
dependency
of
great
britain
as
i
am
sure
that
if
you
had
continued
to
be
so
the
queen
would
have
had
great
pleasure
in
sending
you
some
plates
too
of
course
this
was
meant
for
the
broadest
sort
of
joke
calculated
to
raise
a
laugh
after
dinner
but
to
my
amazement
the
company
chose
to
take
me
literally
and
applauded
for
about
ten
minutes
in
fact
i
could
not
go
on
for
some
time
bunch
evidently
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
this
demonstration
he
could
with
difficulty
believe
that
south
carolina
wished
to
be
as
a
colony
of
great
britain
and
comments
upon
the
episode
in
a
somewhat
humorous
vein
nevertheless
in
concluding
his
letter
he
solemnly
assures
lord
lyons
that
the
jockey
club
is
composed
of
the
people
of
south
carolina
rich
planters
and
the
like
it
represents
therefore
the
interest
and
not
a
bit
of
universal
suffrage
it
would
be
idle
to
assume
that
either
in
south
carolina
or
in
england
there
was
in
february
any
serious
thought
of
a
resumption
of
colonial
relations
though
russell
correspondent
of
the
reported
in
the
spring
that
he
frequently
heard
the
same
sentiment
in
the
south
for
general
official
england
as
for
the
press
the
truth
is
that
up
to
the
time
of
the
secession
of
south
carolina
no
one
really
believed
that
a
final
rupture
was
about
to
take
place
between
north
and
south
when
on
december
that
state
in
solemn
convention
declared
the
dissolution
of
the
union
now
existing
between
south
carolina
and
the
other
states
under
the
name
of
the
states
of
america
and
when
it
was
understood
that
other
southern
states
would
soon
follow
this
example
british
opinion
believed
and
hoped
that
the
rupture
would
be
accomplished
peaceably
until
it
became
clear
that
war
would
ensue
the
south
was
still
damned
by
the
press
as
seeking
the
preservation
of
an
evil
institution
slavery
was
even
more
vigorously
asserted
as
the
ignoble
and
sole
cause
in
the
number
for
april
the
attributed
the
whole
difficulty
to
slavery
asserted
that
british
sympathy
would
be
with
the
party
yet
advanced
the
theory
that
the
very
dissolution
of
the
union
would
hasten
the
ultimate
extinction
of
slavery
since
economic
competition
with
a
neighbouring
free
state
the
north
would
compel
the
south
itself
to
abandon
its
beloved
domestic
institution
upon
receipt
of
the
news
from
south
carolina
the
in
a
long
and
carefully
worded
editorial
took
up
one
by
one
the
alleged
causes
of
secession
dismissed
them
as
inadequate
and
concluded
we
can
not
disguise
from
ourselves
that
apart
from
all
political
complications
there
is
a
right
and
a
wrong
in
this
question
and
that
the
right
belongs
with
all
its
advantages
to
the
states
of
the
north
three
days
later
it
asserted
the
north
is
for
freedom
of
discussion
the
south
represses
freedom
of
discussion
with
the
and
the
and
again
on
january
the
southern
states
expected
sympathy
for
their
undertaking
from
the
public
opinion
of
this
country
the
tone
of
the
press
has
already
done
much
to
undeceive
them
in
general
both
the
metropolitan
and
the
provincial
press
expressed
similar
sentiments
though
there
were
exceptions
the
published
with
approval
a
long
communication
addressed
to
irishmen
at
home
and
abroad
there
is
no
power
on
earth
or
in
heaven
which
can
keep
in
peace
this
unholy
i
hope
that
the
north
will
quietly
permit
the
south
to
retire
from
the
confederacy
and
bear
alone
the
odium
of
all
mankind
the
thought
that
deeper
than
declared
differences
lay
the
ruling
social
structure
of
the
south
which
now
visioned
a
of
the
african
slave
trade
and
the
occupation
by
slavery
of
the
whole
southern
portion
of
north
america
a
more
ignoble
basis
for
a
great
confederacy
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
nor
one
in
the
long
run
more
precarious
assuredly
it
will
be
the
northern
confederacy
based
on
principles
of
freedom
with
a
policy
untainted
by
crime
with
a
free
of
white
men
that
will
be
the
one
to
go
on
and
prosper
and
become
the
leader
of
the
new
world
the
was
vigorous
in
denunciation
no
country
on
the
globe
produces
a
blackguardism
a
cowardice
or
a
treachery
so
consummate
as
that
of
the
states
of
the
new
southern
confederacy
a
bit
of
editorial
blackguardism
in
itself
the
more
moderately
stigmatized
slavery
as
the
cause
but
was
lukewarm
in
praise
of
northern
idealisms
regarding
the
whole
matter
as
one
of
diverging
economic
systems
and
in
any
case
as
inevitably
resulting
in
dissolution
of
the
union
at
some
time
the
inevitable
might
as
well
come
now
as
later
and
would
result
in
benefit
to
both
sections
as
well
as
to
the
world
fearing
the
monstrous
empire
of
power
that
had
grown
up
in
america
the
great
bulk
of
early
expressions
by
the
british
press
was
in
truth
definitely
antagonistic
to
the
south
and
this
was
particularly
true
of
the
provincial
press
garrison
advocating
extreme
abolition
action
had
long
made
a
practice
of
presenting
excerpts
from
british
newspapers
speeches
and
sermons
in
support
of
its
cause
in
there
were
such
citations
in
the
first
months
of
many
more
all
condemning
slavery
and
the
south
for
the
most
part
these
citations
represented
a
comparatively
unknown
and
uninfluential
section
both
in
politics
and
literature
of
the
british
people
matthew
arnold
was
among
the
first
of
men
of
letters
to
record
his
faith
that
secession
was
final
and
as
he
hoped
an
excellent
thing
for
the
north
looking
to
the
purity
of
race
and
the
opportunity
for
unhampered
advance
if
english
writers
were
in
any
way
influenced
by
their
correspondents
in
the
united
states
they
may
indeed
have
well
been
in
doubt
as
to
the
origin
and
prospects
of
the
american
quarrel
hawthorne
but
recently
at
home
again
after
seven
years
consulship
in
england
was
writing
that
abolition
was
not
a
northern
object
in
the
war
just
begun
whittier
wrote
to
english
friends
that
slavery
and
slavery
alone
was
the
basic
issue
but
literary
britain
was
slow
to
express
itself
save
in
the
reviews
these
representing
varying
shades
of
british
opinion
and
presenting
articles
presumably
more
profound
than
the
newspaper
editorials
frequently
offered
more
recondite
origins
of
the
american
crisis
the
organ
of
extreme
conservatism
in
its
first
article
dwelt
upon
the
failure
of
democratic
institutions
a
topic
not
here
treated
at
length
since
it
will
be
dealt
with
in
a
separate
chapter
as
deserving
special
study
the
is
also
the
first
to
advance
the
argument
that
the
protective
tariff
advocated
by
the
north
was
a
real
cause
for
southern
secession
an
idea
made
much
of
later
by
the
elements
unfriendly
to
the
north
but
not
hitherto
advanced
in
these
first
issues
of
the
reviews
for
there
was
frequently
put
forth
the
southern
gentlemen
theory
at
a
distance
of
three
thousand
miles
the
southern
planters
did
indeed
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
english
country
gentleman
which
led
to
a
feeling
of
kinship
and
sympathy
with
him
on
the
part
of
those
in
england
who
represented
the
old
traditions
of
landed
gentility
this
theory
containing
as
it
did
an
undeniable
element
of
truth
is
much
harped
upon
by
certain
of
the
reviewers
and
one
can
easily
conceive
of
its
popularity
in
the
london
clubs
the
so
familiar
to
british
readers
during
the
first
half
of
the
century
through
the
eyes
of
such
travellers
as
trollope
now
becomes
the
and
is
located
north
of
mason
and
dixon
line
such
portrayal
was
not
characteristic
of
all
reviews
rather
of
the
tory
organs
alone
and
the
radical
took
pains
to
deny
the
truth
of
the
picture
asserting
again
and
again
that
the
vital
and
sole
cause
of
the
conflict
was
slavery
previous
articles
are
summed
up
in
that
of
october
as
a
profession
of
the
opinion
throughout
the
south
are
fighting
for
liberty
to
found
a
slave
power
should
it
prove
successful
truer
devil
work
if
we
may
use
the
metaphor
will
rarely
have
been
done
fortunate
would
it
have
been
for
the
northern
cause
if
british
opinion
generally
sympathetic
at
first
on
grounds
had
not
soon
found
cause
to
doubt
the
just
basis
of
its
sympathy
from
the
trend
of
events
in
america
lincoln
had
been
elected
on
a
platform
opposing
the
further
territorial
expansion
of
slavery
on
that
point
the
north
was
fairly
well
united
but
the
great
majority
of
those
who
voted
for
lincoln
would
have
indignantly
repudiated
any
purpose
to
take
active
steps
toward
the
extinction
of
slavery
where
it
already
existed
lincoln
understood
this
perfectly
and
whatever
his
opinion
about
the
ultimate
fate
of
slavery
if
prohibited
expansion
he
from
the
first
took
the
ground
that
the
terms
of
his
election
constituted
a
mandate
limiting
his
action
as
secession
developed
he
rightly
centred
his
thought
and
effort
on
the
preservation
of
the
union
a
duty
imposed
by
his
election
to
the
presidency
naturally
as
the
crisis
developed
there
were
many
efforts
at
still
another
great
compromise
among
the
friends
of
the
outgoing
president
buchanan
whose
term
of
office
would
not
expire
until
march
there
were
still
some
southern
leaders
like
jefferson
davis
seeking
either
a
complete
surrender
to
southern
will
or
advantages
for
southern
security
in
case
secession
was
accomplished
buchanan
appealed
hysterically
to
the
love
of
the
union
and
to
the
spirit
of
compromise
great
congressional
committees
of
both
senate
and
house
of
representatives
were
formed
seeking
a
solution
crittenden
for
the
border
states
between
north
and
south
where
more
than
anywhere
else
there
was
division
of
opinion
proposed
pledges
to
be
given
to
the
south
seward
champion
of
the
north
was
active
in
the
senate
in
suggestion
and
intrigue
seemingly
intended
to
conciliate
by
concessions
charles
francis
adams
early
a
free
soiler
in
the
house
of
representatives
committee
conducted
his
republican
colleagues
along
a
path
apparently
leading
to
a
guarantee
of
slavery
as
then
established
a
constitutional
amendment
was
drafted
to
this
effect
and
received
lincoln
preliminary
approval
finally
lincoln
in
his
inaugural
address
march
declared
i
have
no
purpose
directly
or
indirectly
to
interfere
with
the
institution
of
slavery
in
the
states
where
it
exists
i
believe
i
have
no
lawful
right
to
do
so
and
i
have
no
inclination
to
do
so
it
should
be
no
matter
for
surprise
therefore
that
as
these
efforts
were
observed
in
great
britain
a
note
of
uncertainty
began
to
replace
the
earlier
unanimity
of
opinion
that
the
future
of
slavery
was
at
stake
in
america
this
offered
an
easy
excuse
for
a
of
sympathy
as
british
commercial
and
other
interests
began
to
be
developed
and
even
dismayed
the
ardent
friends
of
the
north
meanwhile
the
government
of
great
britain
from
the
very
first
appearance
of
the
cloud
of
civil
war
had
focused
its
attention
on
the
point
of
what
the
events
in
america
portended
to
british
interests
and
policy
this
is
the
business
of
governments
and
their
agents
would
be
condemned
as
inefficient
did
they
neglect
it
but
did
british
governmental
policy
go
beyond
this
entirely
justifiable
first
thought
for
immediate
british
interests
to
the
point
of
positive
hope
that
england
would
find
an
advantage
in
the
breaking
up
of
the
great
american
republic
american
opinion
both
then
and
later
believed
great
britain
guilty
of
this
offence
but
such
criticism
was
tinged
with
the
passions
of
the
civil
war
yet
a
more
impartial
critic
though
possibly
an
unfriendly
one
because
of
his
official
position
made
emphatic
declaration
to
like
effect
on
january
baron
de
brunow
russian
ambassador
at
london
reported
to
petersburg
that
the
english
government
at
the
bottom
of
its
heart
desires
the
separation
of
north
america
into
two
republics
which
will
watch
each
other
jealously
and
counterbalance
one
the
other
then
england
on
terms
of
peace
and
commerce
with
both
would
have
nothing
to
fear
from
either
for
she
would
dominate
them
restraining
them
by
their
rival
ambitions
if
however
one
turns
from
the
surmises
of
foreign
diplomats
as
to
the
springs
of
british
policy
to
the
more
authentic
evidence
of
official
and
private
diplomatic
correspondence
there
is
found
no
proof
for
such
accusations
certainty
neither
lord
john
russell
foreign
secretary
nor
lord
lyons
british
minister
at
washington
reveal
any
animus
against
the
united
states
considering
his
many
personal
ties
with
leaders
of
both
factions
lyons
from
the
first
reported
events
with
wonderful
impartiality
and
great
clarity
on
november
he
sent
to
russell
a
full
description
of
the
clamour
raised
in
the
south
over
the
election
of
lincoln
enumerated
the
resignation
of
federal
officials
calling
these
measures
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
lincoln
was
no
radical
he
hoped
the
storm
would
blow
over
without
damage
to
the
union
russell
for
his
part
was
prompt
to
instruct
lyons
and
the
british
consuls
not
to
seem
to
favour
one
party
rather
than
the
other
and
not
to
express
opinions
or
to
give
advice
unless
asked
for
by
the
state
governments
in
which
case
the
advice
should
be
against
all
violent
action
as
tending
toward
civil
war
this
bare
statement
may
indeed
be
interpreted
as
indicating
an
eager
readiness
on
russell
part
to
accept
as
final
the
dissolution
of
the
union
but
such
an
interpretation
is
not
borne
out
by
a
reading
of
his
instructions
rather
he
was
perplexed
and
anxious
that
british
agents
should
not
gain
the
of
either
american
faction
an
that
would
be
alike
detrimental
in
the
future
whether
the
union
remained
unbroken
or
was
destroyed
strict
instructions
against
offering
advice
are
therefore
repeated
frequently
meanwhile
the
first
concrete
problem
requiring
british
action
came
from
the
seizure
by
south
carolina
of
the
federal
customs
house
at
the
port
of
charleston
and
the
attempt
of
the
state
authorities
to
collect
port
dues
customarily
paid
to
federal
officials
british
shipowners
appealed
to
consul
bunch
for
instructions
he
to
lyons
and
the
latter
to
the
american
secretary
of
state
judge
black
this
was
on
december
while
buchanan
was
still
president
and
black
answer
was
evasive
though
asserting
that
the
united
states
must
technically
regard
the
events
in
south
carolina
as
acts
of
violent
rebellion
black
refused
to
state
what
action
would
be
taken
if
bunch
advised
british
shipowners
to
pay
but
a
way
out
of
the
embarrassment
was
found
by
advising
such
payment
to
state
authorities
under
protest
as
done
under
compulsion
to
one
of
his
letters
to
bunch
on
this
topic
lyons
appended
an
expression
indicative
of
his
own
early
attitude
the
domestic
slavery
of
the
south
is
a
bitter
pill
which
it
will
be
hard
enough
to
get
the
english
to
swallow
but
if
the
slave
trade
is
to
be
added
to
the
dose
the
least
squeamish
british
stomach
will
reject
it
nevertheless
the
vigorous
action
of
south
carolina
soon
followed
by
other
southern
states
made
a
deep
impression
on
russell
especially
when
compared
with
the
uncertainty
and
irresolution
manifested
in
the
attempted
compromise
measures
of
northern
statesmen
in
a
private
letter
to
lyons
january
he
wrote
i
do
not
see
how
the
united
states
can
be
cobbled
together
again
by
any
compromise
i
can
not
see
any
mode
of
reconciling
such
parties
as
these
the
best
thing
would
be
that
the
right
to
secede
should
be
acknowledged
i
hope
sensible
men
will
take
this
view
but
above
all
i
hope
no
force
will
be
used
and
again
twelve
days
later
i
suppose
the
of
the
union
is
now
inevitable
to
russell
as
to
most
foreign
observers
it
seemed
that
if
the
south
with
its
great
wealth
its
enormous
extent
of
territory
and
its
five
and
millions
of
population
were
determined
to
leave
the
union
no
force
whatever
could
compel
a
return
history
failed
to
record
any
revolution
on
so
large
a
scale
which
had
not
succeeded
his
desire
therefore
was
that
the
north
would
yield
to
the
inevitable
and
would
not
plunge
into
a
useless
civil
war
disastrous
alike
to
the
prosperity
of
america
and
of
foreign
nations
first
hope
was
that
the
south
would
forgo
secession
his
second
this
accomplished
that
there
would
be
no
war
and
in
this
sense
he
instructed
lyons
the
latter
less
expectant
of
peaceful
separation
and
more
aware
of
the
latent
power
of
the
north
maintained
throughout
his
entire
service
at
washington
that
there
was
at
least
a
that
the
north
could
subdue
the
south
by
might
of
arms
but
he
also
looking
to
british
interests
saw
his
early
duty
before
war
broke
in
cautious
suggestions
against
forcible
northern
action
thus
from
january
to
march
british
effort
and
indirect
advice
were
based
on
the
hope
that
british
trade
interests
might
escape
the
tribulations
inevitable
from
a
civil
conflict
in
america
beyond
that
point
there
was
no
grasp
of
the
complications
likely
to
arise
in
case
of
war
and
no
clear
formulation
of
british
policy
in
fact
up
to
the
middle
of
march
both
public
and
official
british
opinion
discounted
armed
conflict
or
at
least
any
determined
northern
effort
to
recover
the
south
early
british
attitude
was
therefore
based
on
a
misconception
as
this
became
clear
public
opinion
began
to
break
from
a
united
humanitarian
sentiment
and
to
show
in
some
quarters
quite
another
face
even
as
early
as
january
the
expressed
wonder
that
the
northern
states
had
not
availed
themselves
gladly
of
the
chance
to
shake
off
such
an
incubus
and
to
purify
themselves
of
such
a
stain
and
a
month
later
professed
to
believe
that
great
britain
would
willingly
permit
the
north
to
secure
compensation
for
loss
of
territory
by
annexing
canada
provided
the
canadians
themselves
desired
it
this
it
was
argued
would
directly
benefit
england
herself
by
cutting
down
military
expenditures
the
indulged
in
similar
speculation
though
from
the
angle
of
a
canadian
annexation
of
the
northern
states
whose
more
sober
citizens
must
by
now
be
weary
of
the
sham
of
american
democracy
and
disgusted
with
the
rowdyism
of
political
elections
which
combine
the
morals
of
a
horse
race
the
manners
of
a
dog
fight
the
passions
of
a
and
the
emotions
of
a
gambling
house
probably
such
suggestions
had
little
real
purpose
or
meaning
at
the
moment
but
it
is
interesting
that
this
idea
of
a
compensation
in
canada
should
have
been
voiced
thus
early
even
in
the
united
states
the
same
thought
had
occurred
to
a
few
political
leaders
charles
sumner
held
it
though
too
wise
politically
to
advance
it
in
the
face
of
the
growing
northern
determination
to
preserve
the
union
it
lay
at
the
bottom
of
his
increasing
bitterness
toward
his
old
friend
charles
francis
adams
now
busy
in
schemes
intended
apparently
to
restore
the
union
by
compromise
and
it
led
sumner
to
hope
for
appointment
as
minister
to
england
the
chief
organ
of
british
opinion
the
was
one
of
the
first
to
begin
the
process
of
face
about
as
civil
war
in
america
seemed
imminent
viewed
from
the
later
attitude
of
the
the
earlier
expressions
of
that
paper
and
in
truth
of
many
british
journals
seem
merely
the
customary
platitudinous
british
holding
up
of
horrified
hands
at
american
slavery
on
january
a
strong
editorial
still
proclaimed
the
folly
of
south
carolina
as
acting
without
law
without
justice
but
displayed
a
real
dismay
at
the
possible
consequences
of
war
to
british
trade
and
commerce
on
january
the
reprinted
an
article
from
the
on
a
probable
cessation
of
cotton
supply
and
editorially
professed
great
alarm
even
advocating
an
early
recognition
of
the
southern
confederacy
if
needed
to
maintain
that
supply
from
this
time
on
there
is
no
further
note
in
the
of
the
righteousness
of
the
northern
cause
but
while
it
is
still
asserted
that
war
would
be
folly
the
strength
of
the
south
its
superiority
as
a
military
nation
are
depicted
a
long
break
of
nearly
six
weeks
follows
with
little
editorial
comment
soon
the
correspondence
from
new
york
previously
written
by
bancroft
davis
and
extremely
favourable
to
the
northern
cause
was
discontinued
russell
the
famous
war
correspondent
of
the
crimea
was
summoned
to
london
and
according
to
his
own
story
upon
being
given
papers
clippings
and
correspondence
largely
articles
from
the
york
supporting
the
right
of
the
south
to
secede
hastily
took
his
departure
for
america
to
report
upon
the
situation
he
sailed
from
queenstown
on
march
and
arrived
in
new
york
on
march
at
last
on
march
the
took
positive
ground
in
favour
of
the
justice
of
the
southern
cause
no
treachery
has
been
at
work
to
produce
the
disruption
and
the
principles
avowed
are
such
as
to
command
the
sympathies
of
every
free
and
enlightened
people
such
are
the
widely
different
auspices
under
which
the
two
rival
republics
start
into
existence
but
mankind
will
not
ultimately
judge
these
things
by
sympathies
and
antipathies
they
will
be
greatly
swayed
by
their
own
interest
and
the
two
republics
must
be
weighed
not
by
their
professions
or
their
previous
history
but
by
the
conduct
they
pursue
and
the
position
they
maintain
among
the
powers
of
the
earth
their
internal
institutions
are
their
own
affair
their
financial
and
political
arrangements
are
emphatically
ours
brazil
is
a
empire
but
by
its
good
faith
and
good
conduct
it
has
contrived
to
establish
for
itself
a
place
in
the
hierarchy
of
nations
far
superior
to
that
of
many
powers
which
are
free
from
this
domestic
contamination
if
the
northern
confederacy
of
america
evinces
a
determination
to
act
in
a
narrow
exclusive
and
unsocial
spirit
while
its
southern
competitor
extends
the
hand
of
good
fellowship
to
all
mankind
with
the
exception
of
its
own
bondsmen
we
must
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
north
in
spite
of
the
goodness
of
its
cause
and
the
great
negative
merit
of
the
absence
of
slavery
sink
into
a
secondary
position
and
lose
the
sympathy
and
regard
of
mankind
this
to
northern
view
was
a
sad
relapse
from
that
high
moral
tone
earlier
addressed
to
the
south
notifying
that
england
would
not
stultify
the
policy
of
half
a
century
for
the
sake
of
an
extended
cotton
trade
the
with
more
consistency
still
reported
the
violence
and
recklessness
of
the
south
yet
in
logical
argument
proved
to
its
own
satisfaction
the
impossibility
of
northern
reconquest
and
urged
a
peaceful
separation
the
even
though
had
at
first
small
hope
of
reunion
by
force
and
offered
consolation
in
the
thought
that
there
would
still
remain
a
united
states
of
america
strong
powerful
and
free
all
the
stronger
for
the
loss
of
the
black
south
in
short
from
all
quarters
the
public
press
whatever
its
sympathy
united
in
decrying
war
as
a
useless
effort
doomed
to
failure
if
undertaken
in
the
hope
of
restoring
the
union
such
public
opinion
however
was
not
necessarily
governmental
opinion
the
latter
was
indeed
more
slow
to
make
up
its
mind
and
more
considerate
in
expressing
itself
when
it
became
clear
that
in
all
probability
the
north
would
fight
there
was
still
no
conception
any
more
than
in
the
united
states
itself
of
the
duration
and
intensity
of
the
conflict
indeed
russell
yet
hoped
as
late
as
the
end
of
january
that
no
protracted
war
would
occur
nevertheless
he
was
compelled
to
face
the
situation
in
its
relation
to
british
commerce
on
february
russell
addressed
lyons
on
that
aspect
of
possible
war
which
would
at
once
call
for
a
determination
of
british
policy
above
all
things
he
wrote
endeavour
to
prevent
a
blockade
of
the
southern
coast
it
would
produce
misery
discord
and
enmity
incalculable
within
a
week
forster
a
thorough
friend
of
the
north
throughout
the
whole
war
was
interrogating
the
ministry
in
the
house
of
commons
in
regard
to
the
situation
at
charleston
and
expressing
the
hope
that
england
would
not
in
any
way
attempt
to
interfere
this
was
the
first
reference
in
parliament
its
sittings
but
just
renewed
after
the
long
vacation
to
the
american
conflict
but
british
commercial
interests
were
being
forced
to
a
keener
attention
and
already
men
in
many
circles
were
asking
themselves
what
should
be
the
proper
governmental
attitude
how
soon
this
new
southern
confederacy
could
justly
claim
european
recognition
how
far
and
how
fast
european
governments
ought
to
go
in
acknowledging
such
a
claim
what
ought
to
be
the
proper
policy
and
position
of
a
neutral
power
whether
indeed
a
declaration
of
neutrality
ought
to
be
issued
with
these
questions
rapidly
coming
to
the
front
it
became
important
for
british
statesmen
to
know
something
about
the
leaders
in
this
new
southern
movement
the
attitude
of
the
people
in
general
and
the
purposes
of
the
new
government
here
unfortunately
lord
lyons
could
be
no
guide
the
consuls
in
the
south
however
were
in
a
position
to
give
their
impressions
on
february
bunch
wrote
to
russell
describing
the
election
of
davis
and
stephens
to
the
presidency
and
of
the
confederacy
and
giving
a
personal
characterization
of
many
members
of
the
government
he
was
rather
caustic
davis
he
said
was
the
only
man
and
he
unfortunately
was
a
confirmed
manifest
destiny
leader
so
much
so
in
fact
that
bunch
prophesied
a
renewal
of
filibustering
when
once
the
north
had
acquiesced
in
a
southern
state
and
the
fear
of
the
north
had
passed
bunch
had
no
faith
in
any
future
greatness
of
the
south
asserting
that
it
would
be
a
state
despised
among
nations
for
its
maintenance
of
slavery
and
that
it
could
not
hope
for
any
encouragement
or
sympathy
from
the
humane
nations
of
europe
in
fact
his
entire
characterization
was
wholly
damning
to
the
south
yet
it
is
to
be
noted
that
he
never
for
a
moment
questioned
that
the
south
had
already
actually
established
its
independence
this
he
seems
to
take
for
granted
thus
again
and
from
another
quarter
there
was
presented
the
double
difficulty
of
england
in
regard
to
the
civil
war
the
difficulty
of
reconciling
sentiments
of
humanity
long
preached
by
great
britain
with
her
commercial
interests
and
her
certainty
that
a
new
state
was
being
born
for
men
in
the
northern
government
lyons
was
in
a
position
to
report
but
up
to
the
end
of
january
he
had
not
written
in
any
great
detail
with
regard
to
the
new
administration
and
its
though
on
january
he
had
informed
russell
that
seward
would
be
the
secretary
of
state
and
had
expressed
the
fear
that
with
regard
to
great
britain
he
would
be
a
dangerous
foreign
minister
lincoln
was
still
in
illinois
and
the
constituency
of
the
cabinet
was
yet
uncertain
but
seward
voice
was
sure
to
be
a
powerful
one
occasionally
lyons
found
some
opportunity
to
talk
with
him
on
february
in
an
official
letter
to
russell
lyons
reported
at
length
an
interview
with
seward
in
which
the
latter
had
expressed
his
extreme
confidence
that
the
trouble
in
america
was
but
superficial
and
that
union
sentiment
in
the
south
would
soon
prevail
in
a
private
letter
of
the
same
date
however
lyons
asserted
that
seward
was
indeed
likely
to
be
a
very
dangerous
secretary
of
state
he
had
told
lyons
that
if
european
governments
interfered
to
protect
their
commerce
he
could
unite
america
by
a
foreign
war
in
order
to
resist
such
interference
again
on
february
while
himself
expressing
hope
that
a
solution
might
be
found
for
the
difficulties
in
america
lyons
warned
russell
that
there
were
those
who
would
solve
these
difficulties
by
a
foreign
war
especially
if
foreign
governments
refused
to
acknowledge
a
united
states
declaration
without
formal
blockade
closing
the
southern
ports
writing
privately
lyons
exhibited
great
anxiety
in
regard
to
seward
attitude
and
suggested
that
the
best
safeguard
would
be
close
union
by
england
and
france
for
if
these
two
governments
took
exactly
the
same
stand
in
regard
to
trade
seward
would
hardly
dare
to
carry
out
his
threat
lyons
letter
of
february
called
out
from
russell
an
instruction
in
which
it
was
repeated
that
advice
to
either
party
should
be
withheld
and
a
strictly
neutral
attitude
maintained
and
russell
concluded
by
an
assertion
that
if
the
united
states
attempted
a
jingo
policy
toward
england
the
british
cabinet
would
be
tolerant
because
of
its
feeling
of
strength
but
that
blustering
demonstrations
must
not
be
carried
too
far
even
as
early
as
december
russell
had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
what
he
considered
a
mere
jingo
policy
for
home
effect
in
america
now
however
upon
the
repeated
expression
of
fears
from
lyons
that
this
might
be
more
than
mere
bunkum
russell
began
to
instruct
lyons
not
to
permit
english
dignity
to
be
infringed
while
at
the
same
time
desiring
him
to
be
cautious
against
stirring
american
antagonism
lyons
earlier
disquietude
seems
indeed
to
have
passed
away
for
a
time
and
on
february
he
wrote
that
everyone
was
waiting
to
see
what
lincoln
would
do
when
inaugurated
that
there
was
still
hope
of
compromise
and
that
in
his
own
view
this
was
still
possible
in
this
letter
the
tone
is
more
important
than
the
matter
and
so
far
as
lyons
is
concerned
the
tone
is
all
distinctly
hopeful
all
favourable
to
a
resumption
of
normal
relations
between
the
north
and
south
he
at
least
had
no
hope
of
disruption
and
no
happiness
in
it
before
this
communication
could
reach
england
russell
had
thoroughly
awakened
to
the
seriousness
of
the
american
situation
in
relation
to
british
foreign
trade
on
march
writing
privately
to
lyons
he
stated
i
hope
you
are
getting
on
well
with
the
new
president
if
he
blockades
the
southern
ports
we
shall
be
in
a
difficulty
but
according
to
all
american
doctrine
it
must
be
an
actual
blockade
kept
up
by
an
efficient
force
thus
before
any
act
had
really
occurred
in
america
the
matter
of
a
blockade
was
occupying
the
attention
of
british
statesmen
one
difficulty
at
the
time
was
that
there
was
no
one
in
england
qualified
to
speak
for
the
new
administration
at
washington
dallas
the
american
minister
appointed
under
the
buchanan
administration
while
unlike
some
other
diplomatic
representatives
abroad
faithful
to
the
cause
of
the
united
states
was
nevertheless
not
wholly
trusted
by
lincoln
or
by
seward
and
was
thus
handicapped
in
representing
to
russell
american
conditions
or
intentions
indeed
he
had
very
little
communication
with
russell
adams
nomination
to
england
was
known
to
lyons
on
march
for
on
that
day
he
telegraphed
to
russell
charles
francis
adams
of
massachusetts
is
appointed
minister
in
london
i
think
it
a
very
good
appointment
this
news
was
received
in
london
on
april
but
over
six
weeks
were
yet
to
elapse
before
adams
reached
his
post
the
appointment
of
adams
however
seemed
to
lyons
a
matter
of
congratulation
in
his
hope
that
no
vicious
policy
would
be
indulged
in
by
seward
ten
days
after
his
telegram
he
wrote
at
length
to
russell
making
an
excellent
statement
and
analysis
in
regard
to
the
character
of
adams
adams
is
son
of
john
quincy
adams
the
fifth
of
the
and
grandson
of
john
adams
the
second
the
grandfather
was
the
first
am
minister
in
england
the
father
was
one
of
the
plenipotentiaries
who
signed
in
london
the
convention
of
the
july
adams
as
a
member
of
the
of
for
one
of
the
districts
of
acted
with
the
less
violent
section
of
the
party
during
the
last
session
of
congress
he
made
a
very
remarkable
speech
on
the
state
of
the
union
denying
the
reasonableness
of
the
complaints
of
the
southern
states
but
stating
his
desire
that
every
concession
not
inconsistent
with
honour
and
principle
should
be
made
to
them
he
is
considered
to
be
a
man
of
great
independence
of
character
and
has
the
reputation
of
being
very
tenacious
of
his
own
opinions
in
manner
he
is
quiet
and
unassuming
he
is
a
man
of
good
fortune
adams
comes
of
a
considerable
family
in
of
the
name
of
brooks
the
late
wife
of
edward
everett
who
as
your
is
aware
has
held
the
offices
of
minister
in
london
and
secretary
of
state
was
her
sister
similar
characterizations
were
being
forwarded
at
almost
the
same
time
by
bunch
in
regard
to
the
southern
commissioners
now
being
despatched
to
london
but
they
were
not
so
favourable
mann
wrote
bunch
was
the
son
of
a
bankrupt
grocer
his
personal
character
was
not
good
yet
he
alone
of
the
three
commissioners
appointed
had
had
diplomatic
experience
yancey
it
was
stated
was
an
able
lawyer
a
stirring
orator
and
a
recognized
leader
of
the
secession
movement
but
he
was
also
extremely
in
his
views
had
expressed
himself
in
favour
of
a
renewal
of
the
slave
trade
and
throughout
his
career
had
been
a
manifest
destiny
man
of
rost
bunch
had
no
knowledge
in
conclusion
bunch
described
the
extreme
confidence
expressed
in
the
south
in
king
cotton
and
in
rather
bitter
criticism
stated
that
the
southern
commissioners
thought
even
england
the
foe
of
slavery
would
now
be
compelled
to
bend
the
knee
and
recognize
the
south
in
order
to
get
cotton
the
northern
british
consuls
on
the
other
hand
took
an
astonishingly
view
of
the
whole
situation
archibald
consul
at
new
york
wrote
to
russell
soon
after
the
fall
of
sumter
an
exceedingly
strong
statement
of
his
faith
in
the
power
of
the
north
and
its
fixed
and
unalterable
determination
to
force
the
south
back
into
the
union
his
confidence
in
northern
success
and
his
belief
in
the
justice
of
the
northern
cause
he
ventured
to
suggest
the
proper
policy
for
england
to
pursue
to
offer
immediately
her
services
in
mediation
but
wholly
and
clearly
on
the
side
of
the
north
he
stated
that
if
england
did
not
feel
free
to
offer
mediation
she
should
at
least
show
such
a
consistent
and
effective
demonstration
of
sympathy
and
aid
for
the
north
as
would
help
in
shortening
the
war
the
british
consul
at
boston
wrote
to
russell
in
much
the
same
vein
so
far
indeed
did
these
men
go
in
expressing
their
sympathy
with
the
north
that
lyons
on
april
commented
to
russell
that
these
consuls
had
taken
the
northern
war
fever
and
that
he
had
mildly
reproved
archibald
with
the
inauguration
of
lincoln
on
march
and
the
installation
of
seward
as
secretary
of
state
it
was
possible
for
lyons
to
become
more
active
in
his
efforts
to
prevent
a
disruption
of
british
trade
on
march
he
told
seward
in
a
confidential
conversation
if
the
united
states
determined
to
stop
by
force
so
important
a
commerce
as
that
of
great
britain
with
the
states
i
could
not
answer
for
what
might
happen
it
was
however
a
matter
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
england
to
procure
cheap
cotton
if
a
considerable
rise
were
to
take
place
in
the
price
of
cotton
and
british
ships
were
to
be
at
the
same
time
excluded
from
the
southern
ports
an
immense
pressure
would
be
put
upon
her
majesty
government
to
use
all
the
means
in
their
power
to
open
those
ports
if
her
majesty
government
felt
it
to
be
their
duty
to
do
so
they
would
naturally
endeavour
to
effect
their
object
in
a
manner
as
consistent
as
possible
first
with
their
friendly
feelings
towards
both
sections
of
this
country
and
secondly
with
the
recognized
principles
of
international
law
as
regards
the
latter
point
in
particular
it
certainly
appeared
that
the
most
simple
if
not
the
only
way
would
be
to
recognize
the
southern
confederacy
this
was
plain
speaking
and
lyons
threat
of
recognizing
the
south
did
not
at
the
moment
stir
seward
to
any
retort
but
five
days
later
on
march
lyons
gave
a
dinner
to
seward
and
a
number
of
the
foreign
ministers
and
there
seward
violent
talk
about
seizing
any
and
all
ships
that
tried
to
trade
with
the
south
even
if
there
was
no
blockade
made
lyons
very
anxious
as
a
host
he
diverted
the
conversation
lest
it
become
too
acrimonious
but
he
himself
told
seward
that
it
was
really
a
matter
so
very
serious
that
i
was
unwilling
to
discuss
it
that
his
plan
seemed
to
me
to
amount
in
fact
to
a
paper
blockade
of
the
enormous
extent
of
coast
comprised
in
the
seceding
states
that
the
calling
it
an
enforcement
of
the
revenue
laws
appeared
to
me
to
increase
the
gravity
of
the
measure
for
it
placed
foreign
powers
in
the
dilemma
of
recognizing
the
southern
confederation
or
of
submitting
to
the
interruption
of
their
commerce
lyons
advice
to
russell
was
that
no
rebuff
should
be
given
the
southern
commissioners
when
they
arrived
in
london
but
that
they
be
treated
well
this
he
thought
might
open
seward
eyes
to
his
folly
still
lyons
did
not
yet
fully
believe
that
seward
would
be
so
vigorous
as
his
language
seemed
to
imply
and
on
march
he
wrote
that
prudent
counsels
were
in
the
ascendant
that
there
would
be
no
interference
with
trade
and
that
a
quieter
tone
was
everywhere
perceptible
in
washington
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
british
minister
at
washington
the
danger
spot
in
relations
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
lay
in
this
matter
of
interference
with
trade
to
southern
ports
naturally
and
as
in
duty
bound
he
sought
to
preserve
that
trade
at
first
indeed
he
seems
to
have
thought
that
even
though
a
civil
war
really
ensued
the
trade
might
continue
uninterrupted
certainly
he
bore
hard
and
constantly
on
this
one
point
seeking
to
influence
not
only
officials
at
washington
but
the
public
press
thus
in
a
letter
to
bunch
dated
april
at
a
time
when
he
knew
that
russell
the
correspondent
would
shortly
appear
in
charleston
he
instructed
bunch
to
remember
that
in
talking
to
russell
he
must
especially
impress
him
with
the
idea
that
any
interruption
of
trade
might
and
probably
would
result
in
a
british
recognition
of
the
south
lyons
wrote
the
chance
if
chance
there
still
be
of
preventing
an
interruption
of
the
english
commerce
with
the
is
the
fear
entertained
here
that
it
would
lead
to
our
recognizing
the
in
these
words
is
revealed
however
as
in
other
communications
from
lyons
the
fact
that
he
was
striving
to
prevent
an
interruption
of
trade
rather
than
that
he
was
convinced
such
interruption
ought
to
result
in
a
british
recognition
of
the
south
indeed
as
will
be
seen
when
the
blockade
was
at
last
declared
lyons
thought
it
no
cause
for
recognition
and
was
most
tolerant
of
its
early
ineffectiveness
while
lyons
was
thus
keeping
in
close
touch
with
seward
the
relations
between
england
and
america
at
london
were
exceedingly
meagre
all
that
the
american
minister
dallas
knew
of
russell
intentions
is
summed
up
in
his
despatches
to
seward
of
march
and
april
on
the
former
date
he
gave
an
account
of
an
interview
with
russell
in
which
the
latter
simply
refused
to
pledge
himself
against
a
recognition
of
the
confederacy
in
the
latter
presenting
a
long
memorial
written
by
seward
to
all
of
the
larger
european
governments
arguing
in
friendly
spirit
the
cause
of
the
north
dallas
reported
that
he
drew
from
russell
merely
a
general
expression
of
england
kindly
feeling
towards
the
united
states
and
her
hope
that
there
might
still
be
a
peaceful
solution
russell
again
refused
to
make
any
pledge
in
regard
to
english
policy
in
this
interview
it
was
tacitly
agreed
that
it
would
be
better
for
great
britain
to
await
adams
arrival
before
taking
any
definite
action
or
so
at
least
dallas
understood
russell
though
the
latter
later
denied
that
any
pledge
of
delay
was
given
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
in
russell
mind
whatever
he
might
say
to
dallas
the
separation
in
america
was
an
accomplished
fact
and
the
hope
of
great
britain
was
centred
upon
the
idea
of
a
peaceful
separation
up
to
and
including
april
indeed
lyons
had
been
reporting
that
no
definite
stand
was
yet
being
taken
by
the
american
government
at
the
same
time
russell
was
continuing
his
instructions
to
lyons
to
recommend
conciliation
but
never
to
obtrude
advice
unasked
yet
russell
was
not
wholly
undisturbed
by
the
reports
of
seward
quarrelsome
attitude
for
in
a
private
letter
of
the
same
date
as
the
preceding
he
wrote
to
lyons
i
rely
upon
your
wisdom
patience
and
prudence
to
steer
us
through
the
dangers
of
this
crisis
if
it
can
possibly
be
helped
seward
must
not
be
allowed
to
get
us
into
a
quarrel
i
shall
see
the
southerners
when
they
come
but
not
officially
and
keep
them
at
a
proper
distance
it
is
an
interesting
query
whether
this
fear
thus
expressed
of
seward
temper
was
not
of
distinct
benefit
to
the
united
states
at
the
moment
when
the
southern
commissioners
arrived
in
england
the
inference
would
seem
to
be
clear
that
in
spite
of
advice
to
treat
them
well
the
effect
upon
russell
of
seward
attitude
was
to
treat
them
coolly
russell
was
indeed
distinctly
worried
by
seward
unfriendly
attitude
in
the
meantime
the
british
press
and
public
while
still
uncertain
and
divided
as
to
the
merits
of
the
conflict
were
now
substantially
a
unit
in
accepting
separation
as
final
the
with
judicial
ponderosity
declared
the
new
nationality
has
been
brought
forth
after
a
very
short
period
of
gestation
and
the
seceding
states
have
now
constituted
themselves
a
nation
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
in
newspaper
tone
the
jeered
at
the
northern
american
eagle
as
having
had
his
tail
pulled
out
and
his
wings
clipped
yet
the
meek
bird
now
holds
out
his
claws
to
be
pared
with
a
resignation
that
would
be
degrading
in
the
most
henpecked
of
domestic
fowls
having
now
veered
about
to
expressions
of
confidence
in
the
permanency
of
the
southern
confederacy
the
was
also
compelled
to
alter
its
opinion
of
southern
statesmen
an
editorial
gave
high
praise
to
the
confederate
congress
sitting
at
montgomery
stated
its
personnel
to
be
far
superior
to
that
of
the
congress
at
washington
yet
was
unable
to
resist
making
the
customary
reference
to
manners
traditionally
american
with
regard
to
the
congress
itself
we
can
not
refrain
from
quoting
the
testimony
of
a
visitor
in
its
favour
here
montgomery
who
have
spent
much
time
in
washington
city
declare
that
they
have
never
witnessed
such
industry
care
propriety
courtesy
and
pleasant
congressional
action
one
member
has
appeared
in
his
seat
under
the
influence
of
liquors
or
not
a
harsh
word
has
been
uttered
in
debate
and
all
exhibit
the
most
unflagging
energy
and
determination
the
most
of
the
british
press
quickly
followed
the
lead
of
the
forgot
its
previous
dictum
that
the
south
was
in
the
control
of
ignorant
ruffians
and
dilated
upon
the
statemanlike
directness
and
sagacity
of
southern
leaders
as
contrasted
with
the
stupidity
of
the
north
displayed
in
its
tariff
policy
a
few
journals
thought
that
the
north
might
eventually
win
in
a
prolonged
struggle
but
that
such
a
victory
would
be
disastrous
to
the
principles
of
federalism
and
in
any
case
that
this
civil
war
was
one
without
a
noble
cause
to
sustain
either
side
by
may
nearly
all
the
older
journals
were
aligned
on
the
right
of
the
south
to
secede
and
on
the
fact
of
a
successful
secession
though
still
differing
as
to
the
basic
causes
and
essential
justice
involved
in
this
same
month
however
there
emerged
a
few
vigorous
champions
of
the
northern
cause
and
prospects
in
april
the
agreed
that
the
great
republic
was
at
an
end
in
may
it
urged
the
north
to
fight
it
out
with
hope
asserting
a
chance
of
ultimate
victory
because
of
superior
resources
and
the
sympathy
of
all
european
nations
a
small
newspaper
of
limited
circulation
the
organ
of
john
bright
had
from
the
first
championed
the
northern
cause
now
as
the
armed
conflict
broke
in
america
it
was
joined
by
a
more
important
paper
the
which
set
itself
the
task
of
controverting
the
moreover
the
was
all
the
more
influential
in
that
it
was
not
uncritical
of
the
north
yet
consistently
throughout
the
war
expressed
sympathy
for
the
cause
and
principles
behind
the
efforts
of
the
northern
government
selling
for
a
low
price
the
like
the
among
the
reviews
appealed
to
a
broader
and
more
popular
constituency
than
the
older
publications
especially
to
a
constituency
not
yet
vocal
since
still
unrepresented
in
parliament
the
was
fortunate
in
having
after
the
new
york
correspondent
writing
to
the
london
press
this
was
an
irishman
godkin
who
both
at
home
and
in
america
was
the
intimate
friend
of
literary
men
and
himself
later
a
great
moulder
of
public
opinion
harriet
martineau
further
aided
the
by
contributing
articles
and
was
a
power
in
radical
circles
but
literary
england
in
general
was
slow
to
express
itself
with
conviction
though
robert
browning
by
april
was
firmly
determined
in
his
sentiment
in
august
he
was
writing
in
letters
of
the
good
cause
but
browning
was
a
rare
exception
and
it
was
not
until
the
civil
war
had
been
under
way
for
many
months
that
men
of
talent
in
the
world
were
drawn
to
make
comment
or
to
take
sides
their
influence
at
the
outset
was
negligible
in
spite
of
press
utterances
or
literary
silence
alike
indicative
of
a
widespread
conviction
that
southern
independence
was
assured
there
still
remained
both
in
those
circles
where
sentiment
was
strong
and
in
others
more
neutral
in
sympathy
a
distaste
for
the
state
as
the
embodiment
of
a
degrading
institution
inaugural
address
denying
an
intention
to
interfere
with
slavery
was
a
weapon
for
the
friends
of
the
south
but
it
could
not
wholly
still
that
issue
even
in
the
through
the
medium
of
descriptive
letters
there
appeared
caustic
criticisms
he
wrote
in
his
diary
i
declare
that
to
me
the
more
orderly
methodical
and
perfect
the
arrangements
for
economizing
slave
labour
are
the
more
hateful
and
odious
does
slavery
become
and
in
his
letter
of
may
from
montgomery
having
witnessed
an
auction
sale
of
slaves
he
stated
i
am
neither
sentimentalist
nor
black
republican
nor
negro
worshipper
but
i
confess
the
sight
caused
a
strange
thrill
through
my
heart
i
tried
in
vain
to
make
myself
familiar
with
the
fact
that
i
could
for
the
sum
of
become
as
absolutely
the
owner
of
that
mass
of
blood
bones
sinew
flesh
and
brains
as
of
the
horse
which
stood
by
my
side
there
was
no
sophistry
which
could
persuade
me
the
man
was
not
a
man
he
was
indeed
by
no
means
my
brother
but
assuredly
he
was
a
fellow
creature
this
was
hard
printing
for
the
in
its
new
advocacy
of
the
south
and
russell
description
was
made
much
of
by
the
and
other
publications
that
soon
began
to
sound
again
the
issue
of
slavery
yet
the
itself
in
the
same
article
decried
the
folly
of
the
northern
attempt
at
reconquest
so
also
thought
even
john
bright
at
the
moment
when
expressing
himself
privately
to
friends
in
america
slavery
then
still
remained
an
issue
before
the
british
public
but
of
what
use
was
it
to
upbraid
the
south
if
a
new
world
state
were
in
fact
born
and
if
a
state
in
power
why
not
give
it
prompt
recognition
the
extreme
british
opponents
feared
that
this
was
just
what
the
government
was
inclined
to
do
and
with
promptness
here
and
there
meetings
were
hurriedly
called
to
protest
against
recognition
this
fear
was
unfounded
neither
in
london
nor
at
washington
was
there
any
official
inclination
to
hasten
recognition
lyons
had
held
up
to
seward
the
logic
of
such
action
if
british
trade
were
illegally
interfered
with
by
april
lyons
was
aware
that
the
radical
party
in
the
cabinet
would
probably
have
its
way
that
conciliation
would
no
longer
be
attempted
and
that
a
coercive
policy
toward
the
south
was
soon
to
follow
on
that
date
he
wrote
to
russell
stating
that
people
in
washington
seemed
so
convinced
that
europe
would
interfere
to
protect
its
trade
that
they
were
willing
to
venture
any
act
embarrassing
to
that
trade
he
himself
was
still
insisting
but
with
dwindling
confidence
that
the
trade
must
not
be
interfered
with
under
any
circumstances
and
in
a
second
letter
of
this
same
date
he
repeated
to
russell
his
advice
of
treating
the
southern
commissioners
with
deference
any
rebuff
to
them
he
asserts
again
will
but
increase
the
northern
confidence
that
they
may
do
anything
without
provoking
the
resistance
of
england
like
a
good
diplomat
lyons
was
merely
pushing
the
argument
for
all
it
was
worth
hoping
to
prevent
an
injury
to
his
country
yet
if
that
injury
did
come
provided
it
were
sanctioned
by
the
law
of
nations
he
did
not
see
in
it
an
injury
sufficient
to
warrant
precipitate
action
by
great
britain
when
indeed
the
southern
capture
of
fort
sumter
in
charleston
harbour
finally
brought
the
actual
clash
of
arms
lyons
expressed
himself
with
regard
to
other
elements
in
the
struggle
previously
neglected
in
his
correspondence
on
april
describing
to
russell
the
fall
of
sumter
he
stated
that
civil
war
had
at
last
begun
the
north
he
believed
to
be
very
much
more
powerful
than
the
south
the
south
more
eager
and
united
as
yet
but
he
added
the
taint
of
slavery
will
render
the
cause
of
the
south
loathsome
to
the
civilized
world
it
was
true
that
commercial
intercourse
with
the
cotton
states
is
of
vital
importance
to
manufacturing
nations
but
lyons
was
now
facing
an
actual
situation
rather
than
a
possible
one
and
as
will
be
seen
later
he
soon
ceased
to
insist
that
an
interruption
of
this
commercial
intercourse
gave
reasonable
ground
for
recognition
of
the
south
with
the
fall
of
fort
sumter
and
the
european
recognition
that
a
civil
war
was
actually
under
way
in
america
a
large
number
of
new
and
vexing
problems
was
presented
to
russell
his
treatment
of
them
furnishes
the
subject
matter
of
later
chapters
for
the
period
previous
to
april
british
official
attitude
may
be
summed
up
in
the
statement
that
the
british
minister
at
washington
hoped
against
hope
that
some
solution
might
be
found
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
but
that
at
the
same
time
looking
to
future
british
interests
and
possibly
believing
also
that
his
attitude
would
tend
to
preserve
the
union
he
asserted
vehemently
the
impossibility
of
any
northern
interference
with
british
trade
to
southern
ports
across
the
water
russell
also
hoped
faintly
that
there
might
be
no
separation
very
soon
however
believing
that
separation
inevitable
and
the
disruption
of
the
union
final
he
fixed
his
hope
on
peaceful
rather
than
warlike
secession
even
of
this
however
he
had
little
real
expectation
but
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
in
england
nor
even
in
america
had
any
idea
that
the
war
would
be
a
long
and
severe
one
it
is
evident
that
he
was
already
considering
the
arrival
of
that
day
when
recognition
must
be
granted
to
a
new
independent
and
state
but
this
estimate
of
the
future
is
no
proof
that
the
russian
ambassador
accusation
of
british
governmental
pleasure
in
american
disruption
was
justified
russell
cautious
in
refusing
to
pledge
himself
to
dallas
was
using
exactly
such
caution
as
a
foreign
secretary
was
bound
to
exercise
he
would
have
been
a
rash
man
who
in
view
of
the
uncertainty
and
irresolution
of
northern
statesmen
would
have
committed
great
britain
in
march
to
a
definite
line
of
policy
on
april
russell
was
still
instructing
lyons
to
recommend
reconciliation
april
dallas
communicated
to
russell
an
instruction
from
seward
dated
march
arguing
on
lines
of
traditional
friendship
against
a
british
recognition
of
the
confederacy
russell
again
refused
to
pledge
his
government
but
on
april
he
wrote
to
lyons
that
british
ministers
were
in
no
hurry
to
recognize
the
separation
as
complete
and
final
in
the
early
morning
of
that
same
day
the
armed
conflict
in
america
had
begun
and
on
the
day
following
april
the
first
southern
victory
had
been
recorded
in
the
capture
of
fort
sumter
the
important
question
which
the
man
at
the
head
of
the
british
foreign
office
had
now
immediately
to
decide
was
what
was
to
be
attitude
under
international
law
toward
the
two
combatants
in
america
in
deciding
this
question
neither
sentiment
nor
ideals
of
morality
nor
humanitarianism
need
play
any
part
england
need
and
duty
were
to
determine
and
announce
for
the
benefit
of
her
citizens

correct
position
under

law
which
must
be
assumed
in

it
is
curious
that
in
the
first
period
of
the
war
lyons
made
no
extended
characterization
of
lincoln
probably
his
contacts
with
the
new
president
were
insufficient
to
justify
it

long
pendulous

terminating

the
appearance

sagacity

dark
full

are
penetrating

full
of

the
development
of
a
policy
may
in
june
a
conservative
government
under
the
leadership
of
lord
derby
had
been
replaced
by
a
coalition
liberal
government
at
the
head
of
which
stood
palmerston
but
so
constituted
that
almost
equal
influence
was
attributed
to
the
foreign
secretary
lord
john
russell
both
men
had
previously
held
the
premiership
and
as
they
represented
different
wings
of
the
party
it
was
prophesied
by
political
wiseacres
that
personal
friction
would
soon
lead
to
a
new
disruption
nor
were
the
possible
elements
of
discord
confined
to
these
two
gladstone
formerly
a
peelite
tory
and
for
a
time
uncertain
whether
to
return
to
the
tory
fold
or
to
join
the
liberals
had
yielded
to
palmerston
promise
of
a
free
hand
in
financial
matters
and
had
joined
the
ministry
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
opposed
to
him
in
a
certain
sense
as
the
rival
claimant
for
political
leadership
among
the
younger
group
was
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
home
secretary
until
july
thereafter
until
his
death
in
april
secretary
for
war
acting
in
some
degree
as
intermediary
and
conciliator
between
these
divergent
interests
stood
lord
granville
president
of
council
then
a
especially
valuable
to
the
cabinet
for
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
by
queen
victoria
and
prince
albert
in
palmerston
was
years
old
long
before
this
he
had
built
his
popularity
upon
a
vigorous
british
patriotism
assertive
of
england
honour
and
jealous
for
british
advantage
now
however
as
head
of
a
government
requiring
the
most
delicate
handling
to
maintain
itself
he
devoted
his
energies
to
details
of
political
management
in
which
he
had
great
skill
his
ambition
was
primarily
to
retain
office
and
in
this
purpose
he
was
fortunate
because
unknown
to
his
ministerial
colleagues
he
had
received
an
indirect
pledge
from
lord
derby
the
opposition
leader
that
there
would
be
for
a
time
at
least
no
determined
effort
to
unseat
him
so
long
as
his
ministry
brought
forward
no
bill
for
a
further
expansion
of
the
franchise
in
the
unwillingness
to
make
any
further
adventure
toward
an
expanded
democracy
palmerston
was
wholly
at
one
with
derby
of
like
opinion
though
less
strongly
so
was
russell
whose
popular
nickname
finality
john
gained
by
his
assertion
that
the
reform
bill
of
was
england
last
step
toward
democracy
sufficiently
indicates
his
stand
on
the
franchise
question
in
fact
every
member
of
the
cabinet
belonged
to
the
group
though
with
shades
of
political
faith
and
none
were
really
liberals
far
less
radicals
the
outspoken
radicals
in
parliament
like
john
bright
and
his
friend
cobden
who
had
refused
to
take
office
under
palmerston
gave
a
lukewarm
support
to
the
ministry
but
would
not
pledge
themselves
to
steadfast
adherence
they
had
hopes
of
gladstone
believed
that
he
would
ultimately
come
into
their
group
but
meanwhile
watched
with
anxiety
his
delighted
immersion
as
indeed
palmerston
desired
it
in
the
details
of
financial
management
to
the
exclusion
of
other
questions
the
matter
of
ministerial
and
general
british
attitude
toward
democracy
as
affecting
british
policy
during
the
american
civil
war
will
be
considered
in
a
later
chapter
in
the
spring
of
it
had
not
become
a
british
opinion
and
did
not
so
far
as
historical
evidence
can
determine
affect
early
governmental
policy
toward
america
the
outstanding
feature
of
the
british
government
in
is
that
it
was
made
up
of
various
liberal
elements
the
representatives
of
each
of
which
carried
on
the
business
of
his
own
department
much
as
he
pleased
palmerston
was
of
course
the
deciding
opinion
whenever
he
cared
to
express
it
but
this
he
did
but
rarely
his
great
concern
was
to
keep
his
associates
running
smoothly
together
and
thus
to
give
no
occasion
for
parliamentary
criticism
and
attack
it
followed
that
russell
eight
years
the
junior
of
palmerston
was
in
foreign
affairs
more
powerful
and
independent
than
is
customary
indeed
the
government
was
at
times
spoken
of
as
the
ministry
these
two
were
the
leaders
of
the
team
next
came
gladstone
and
cornewall
lewis
rivals
of
the
younger
generation
and
each
eager
to
lead
when
their
elders
should
retire
from
harness
gladstone
great
ability
was
already
recognized
but
his
personal
political
faith
was
not
yet
clear
lewis
lacking
his
rival
magnetic
and
emotional
qualities
cold
scholarly
and
accurate
in
performance
was
regarded
as
a
statesman
of
high
promise
other
cabinet
members
as
is
the
custom
of
coalitions
were
more
free
in
opinion
and
action
than
in
a
strict
party
ministry
where
one
dominating
personality
imposes
his
will
upon
his
colleagues
lord
john
russell
then
in
foreign
policy
was
more
than
the
main
voice
of
the
government
rather
save
in
times
of
extreme
crisis
governmental
foreign
policy
was
russell
policy
this
was
even
more
true
as
regards
american
than
european
affairs
for
the
former
were
little
understood
and
dependence
was
necessarily
placed
upon
the
man
whose
business
it
was
to
be
familiar
with
them
indeed
there
was
little
actual
parliamentary
or
governmental
interest
before
midsummer
of
in
the
american
question
attention
in
foreign
affairs
being
directed
toward
italian
expansion
to
the
difficulties
related
to
the
control
of
the
ionian
islands
and
to
the
developing
danish
troubles
in
neither
did
the
opposition
party
venture
to
express
a
policy
as
regards
america
lord
derby
able
but
indolent
occasionally
indulged
in
caustic
criticism
but
made
no
attempt
to
push
his
attack
home
malmesbury
his
former
foreign
secretary
was
active
and
alert
in
french
affairs
but
gave
no
thought
to
relations
across
the
atlantic
disraeli
tory
leader
in
the
commons
skilfully
led
a
strong
minority
in
attacks
on
the
government
policy
but
never
on
the
american
question
though
frequently
urged
to
do
so
by
the
friends
of
the
south
in
short
for
the
first
year
of
the
civil
war
the
policy
of
great
britain
toward
america
was
the
policy
of
lord
john
russell
unhampered
by
friend
or
foe
this
being
the
case
what
did
russell
know
about
the
american
crisis
briefly
no
more
than
has
already
been
stated
as
derived
from
the
reports
of
british
officials
in
the
united
states
and
from
the
pages
of
the
public
press
the
salient
facts
known
to
russell
were
few
cabinet
had
been
named
lincoln
himself
was
absolutely
an
unknown
quantity
but
it
was
unbelievable
that
a
man
of
his
origins
and
history
could
be
more
than
a
mere
figurehead
an
opinion
then
held
as
widely
in
america
as
in
england
but
someone
must
determine
american
policy
and
by
universal
consent
this
would
be
seward
the
new
secretary
of
state
was
at
the
moment
better
known
in
england
than
any
other
american
statesman
with
the
possible
exception
of
charles
sumner
whose
visits
and
personal
contacts
had
established
a
circle
of
british
friendships
both
men
were
accepted
as
champions
of
sumner
for
his
vigorous
denunciations
and
his
martyrdom
under
the
physical
violence
of
the
south
carolinan
brooks
and
seward
for
his
clever
political
leadership
in
the
united
states
senate
but
seward
reputation
in
this
respect
was
offset
by
the
belief
that
he
was
in
his
personal
sentiments
or
at
least
that
he
was
very
ready
to
arouse
for
political
ends
the
customary
sentiment
of
his
irish
constituents
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
on
the
occasion
of
the
visit
to
the
united
states
of
the
prince
of
wales
seward
is
alleged
to
have
stated
to
the
duke
of
newcastle
that
in
case
he
became
secretary
of
state
it
would
then
become
my
duty
to
insult
england
and
i
mean
to
do
so
a
threat
whether
jocose
or
not
that
aroused
much
serious
and
anxious
speculation
in
british
governmental
circles
moreover
seward
reputation
was
that
of
a
wily
clever
politician
rather
unscrupulous
in
methods
which
british
politicians
professed
to
disdain
a
reputation
serving
to
dim
somewhat
as
indeed
it
did
in
america
also
the
sincere
idealisms
and
patriotism
of
the
statesman
altogether
seward
was
regarded
in
great
britain
as
a
rather
dangerous
man
yet
as
the
inevitable
guiding
power
in
the
new
republican
administration
this
estimate
was
shared
by
many
in
the
united
states
also
but
not
by
all
the
new
american
minister
to
london
charles
francis
adams
himself
a
most
stiffly
upright
politician
both
regarded
seward
as
the
only
possible
leader
of
republican
party
policy
and
rejoiced
that
this
was
so
having
great
confidence
in
his
chief
integrity
and
wisdom
adams
himself
was
well
suited
to
his
new
post
he
was
known
as
having
early
in
fought
the
battle
of
as
a
free
soil
whig
and
later
as
a
leading
republican
member
of
congress
from
massachusetts
principally
however
he
was
suited
to
his
post
by
education
family
and
character
he
had
been
taken
as
a
boy
to
russia
during
his
ministry
at
petersburg
and
later
had
been
educated
in
england
his
father
and
grandfather
john
quincy
adams
and
john
adams
both
presidents
of
the
united
states
had
both
also
been
american
ministers
at
london
intensely
patriotic
but
having
wide
acquaintance
through
training
and
study
with
european
affairs
especially
those
of
britain
and
equipped
with
high
intellectual
gifts
adams
was
still
further
fitted
to
his
new
post
by
his
power
of
cool
judgment
and
careful
expression
in
critical
times
his
very
coolness
sometimes
appearing
as
coldness
and
stiff
dignity
rendered
him
an
especially
fit
agent
to
deal
with
russell
a
man
of
very
similar
characteristics
the
two
men
quickly
learned
to
respect
and
esteem
each
other
whatever
clash
arose
in
national
policies
but
meanwhile
adams
in
april
was
not
yet
arrived
in
london
the
southern
government
organized
at
montgomery
alabama
but
soon
transferred
to
richmond
virginia
was
headed
by
jefferson
davis
as
president
and
alexander
stephens
as
neither
man
was
well
known
in
england
though
both
had
long
been
prominent
in
american
politics
the
little
british
information
on
davis
that
he
had
served
in
the
united
states
senate
and
as
a
cabinet
member
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
better
fitted
to
executive
duties
than
his
rival
lincoln
but
davis
foreign
policy
was
wholly
a
matter
for
speculation
and
his
cabinet
consisted
of
men
absolutely
unknown
to
british
statesmen
in
truth
it
was
not
a
cabinet
of
distinction
for
it
was
the
misfortune
of
the
south
that
everywhere
as
the
civil
war
developed
southern
gentlemen
sought
reputation
and
glory
in
the
army
rather
than
in
political
position
nor
did
president
davis
himself
ever
fully
grasp
the
importance
to
the
south
of
a
and
energetic
foreign
policy
at
first
indeed
home
controversy
compelled
anxious
attention
to
the
exclusion
of
other
matters
until
war
cemented
southern
patriotism
davis
himself
regarded
as
an
extremist
felt
it
necessary
in
denial
of
an
asserted
unreasonableness
of
personal
attitude
to
appoint
to
office
men
known
for
their
earlier
moderate
opinions
on
both
slavery
and
secession
the
single
exception
to
this
general
policy
was
the
appointment
as
agents
to
europe
of
yancey
rost
and
mann
all
of
them
extreme
men
and
eager
secessionists
of
these
mann
was
the
only
one
with
any
previous
diplomatic
experience
yancey
choice
was
particularly
inappropriate
for
he
at
least
was
known
abroad
as
the
extreme
southern
orator
demanding
for
ten
years
past
that
southern
action
in
defence
of
states
rights
and
southern
interests
which
now
at
last
the
south
was
attempting
yancey
and
rost
starting
on
their
journey
on
march
reached
london
on
april
meanwhile
in
this
same
month
of
april
conditions
in
america
so
long
confused
and
uncertain
were
being
rapidly
clarified
the
south
earlier
than
the
north
had
come
to
a
determined
policy
for
while
during
january
and
february
at
the
montgomery
convention
there
had
been
uncertainty
as
to
actively
applying
the
doctrinaire
right
of
secession
by
march
the
party
of
action
had
triumphed
and
though
there
was
still
talk
of
conferences
with
the
north
and
commissioners
actually
appointed
no
real
expectation
existed
of
a
favourable
result
in
the
north
the
determination
of
policy
was
more
slowly
developed
lincoln
was
not
inaugurated
until
march
and
no
positive
pronouncement
was
earlier
possible
even
after
that
date
uncertainty
still
prevailed
european
correspondents
were
reporting
men
like
sumner
as
willing
to
let
the
south
go
in
peace
the
mayor
of
new
york
city
was
discussing
the
advisability
of
a
separate
secession
by
that
financial
centre
from
nation
and
state
alike
and
of
setting
up
as
a
free
town
seward
just
appointed
secretary
of
state
was
repudiating
in
both
official
and
private
talk
any
intention
to
coerce
the
south
by
force
of
arms
it
is
no
wonder
that
british
statesmen
were
largely
at
sea
over
the
american
situation
but
on
april
the
stars
and
stripes
floating
over
fort
sumter
in
charleston
harbour
was
lowered
in
surrender
of
a
federal
fortress
under
the
armed
attack
of
the
confederacy
that
event
drove
away
as
by
magic
the
uncertainty
of
the
north
and
removed
the
last
vestiges
of
southern
doubt
a
great
wave
of
militant
patriotism
swept
over
both
sections
hurriedly
both
north
and
south
prepared
for
war
issuing
calls
for
volunteers
and
organizing
in
all
accustomed
warlike
preparations
the
news
of
sumter
reached
london
on
april
and
that
civil
war
seemed
certain
was
known
on
april
on
april
davis
since
the
south
lacked
a
navy
approved
a
proclamation
offering
to
issue
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
on
april
lincoln
proclaimed
a
northern
intention
to
treat
as
pirates
any
privateers
acting
under
such
letters
and
also
gave
notice
of
a
blockade
of
southern
ports
to
be
instituted
later
thus
suddenly
so
it
seemed
to
british
officials
and
public
after
the
long
delay
and
uncertainty
of
months
events
in
america
had
precipitated
a
state
of
war
though
in
fact
there
were
still
to
elapse
other
months
in
which
both
north
and
south
laboured
to
transform
a
peaceful
society
into
one
capable
of
waging
effective
battle
the
result
of
this
sudden
change
in
the
american
horizon
was
to
alter
almost
as
quickly
the
previous
delay
in
outlining
a
british
policy
though
presumably
the
british
government
while
waiting
the
turn
of
events
had
given
careful
consideration
to
the
steps
required
of
it
in
just
such
a
situation
as
had
now
arisen
certainly
both
lyons
and
russell
had
been
deeply
anxious
for
some
time
and
had
visualized
a
proper
british
policy
the
movement
in
great
britain
now
became
rapid
on
april
malmesbury
in
the
lords
spoke
of
the
news
of
civil
war
which
had
arrived
this
morning
and
asked
if
the
government
had
tried
to
prevent
it
or
had
set
on
foot
negotiations
with
other
powers
to
check
it
wodehouse
replying
for
the
government
stated
that
the
united
states
as
an
independent
state
would
have
resented
any
suggestions
from
great
britain
and
that
lyons
had
been
instructed
to
be
extremely
careful
about
offering
advice
unless
asked
for
by
the
contending
parties
themselves
both
speakers
commented
on
the
ties
of
blood
rendering
britain
especially
anxious
in
this
american
quarrel
and
regretted
the
conflict
malmesbury
query
as
to
the
approach
to
another
government
meaning
france
was
evaded
that
some
such
approach
in
accordance
with
the
earlier
advice
of
lyons
had
already
been
made
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
three
days
later
on
may
dallas
learned
from
russell
of
the
plan
of
joint
action
with
france
though
what
that
action
would
be
was
not
made
clear
as
dallas
report
was
soon
the
basis
of
an
american
complaint
shortly
to
be
considered
the
paragraph
referring
to
this
matter
is
important
the
solicitude
felt
by
lord
john
russell
as
to
the
effect
of
certain
measures
represented
as
likely
to
be
adopted
by
the
president
induced
him
to
request
me
to
call
at
his
private
residence
yesterday
i
did
so
he
told
me
that
the
three
representatives
of
the
southern
confederacy
were
here
that
he
had
not
seen
them
but
was
not
unwilling
to
do
so
that
there
existed
an
understanding
between
this
government
and
that
of
france
which
would
lead
both
to
take
the
same
course
as
to
recognition
whatever
that
course
might
be
and
he
then
referred
to
the
rumour
of
a
meditated
blockade
of
southern
ports
and
their
discontinuance
as
ports
of
entry
topics
on
which
i
had
heard
nothing
but
as
i
informed
him
that
adams
had
apprised
me
of
his
intention
to
be
on
his
way
hither
in
the
steamship
which
left
boston
on
the
may
and
that
he
would
probably
arrive
in
less
than
two
weeks
by
the
or
instant
his
lordship
acquiesced
in
the
expediency
of
disregarding
mere
rumour
and
waiting
the
full
knowledge
to
be
brought
by
my
successor
the
motion
therefore
of
gregory
may
be
further
postponed
at
his
lordship
suggestion
may
russell
held
an
unofficial
interview
with
the
two
southern
commissioners
in
fact
arrived
yancey
and
rost
as
reported
by
them
russell
listened
with
attention
to
their
representation
but
made
no
informing
comment
they
argued
the
constitutional
right
of
secession
depicted
the
firm
determination
of
the
south
were
confident
of
early
acquiescence
by
the
north
and
especially
laid
stress
on
the
southern
desire
for
free
trade
russell
own
report
to
lyons
on
this
interview
and
on
one
held
six
days
later
may
is
in
substantial
agreement
but
much
more
is
made
by
him
than
by
the
commissioners
of
a
question
put
by
russell
as
to
a
southern
plan
of
reviving
the
african
yancey
and
rost
denied
this
and
asserted
that
they
had
prohibited
the
and
did
not
mean
to
revive
it
their
report
to
richmond
does
not
depict
this
matter
as
of
special
significance
in
the
interview
russell
report
to
lyons
lays
stress
upon
it
the
general
result
of
the
interview
was
that
russell
listened
but
refused
as
to
dallas
to
make
any
pledge
on
recognition
but
the
southern
commissioners
came
away
with
a
feeling
of
confidence
and
were
content
to
wait
on
british
action
on
this
same
day
may
russell
received
from
the
a
memorandum
in
reply
to
a
query
as
to
recognizing
the
belligerency
of
the
south
and
as
to
the
right
of
the
south
to
issue
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
the
memorandum
notes
that
southern
privateering
would
be
dangerous
to
british
commerce
with
the
north
but
sees
no
help
for
it
the
best
solution
wrote
the
would
be
for
the
european
nations
to
determine
that
the
war
between
the
two
confederacies
shall
be
carried
on
on
the
principles
of
bellum
and
shall
be
conducted
according
to
the
rules
of
the
treaty
of
paris
recognize
the
southern
states
as
a
belligerent
on
this
condition
only
the
next
day
referring
to
this
memorandum
russell
wrote
lyons
that
the
law
officers
are
of
opinion
that
we
must
consider
the
civil
war
in
america
as
regular
war
but
he
does
comment
on
the
legal
advice
to
press
the
south
to
abandon
privateering
before
recognizing
her
belligerent
rights
for
this
is
the
only
meaning
that
can
be
attached
to
the
last
sentence
quoted
from
the
memorandum
this
advice
however
in
view
of
the
opinion
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
was
presumably
but
a
suggestion
as
to
a
possible
diplomatic
manoeuvre
with
little
confidence
that
it
would
succeed
the
best
solution
was
not
the
probable
one
for
the
south
without
a
navy
would
not
readily
yield
its
only
naval
weapon
in
these
few
days
british
policy
was
rapidly
matured
and
announced
the
letter
of
may
to
lyons
stating
the
civil
war
to
be
a
regular
war
was
followed
on
may
by
a
formal
instruction
giving
lyons
advance
notice
of
the
determination
reached
by
the
cabinet
to
recognize
the
belligerent
rights
of
the
south
russell
indulged
in
many
expressions
of
regret
and
sympathy
but
lyons
was
not
to
conceal
that
this
british
action
represented
the
government
view
of
the
actualities
of
the
american
situation
yet
while
lyons
was
not
to
conceal
this
opinion
he
was
not
instructed
to
notify
seward
officially
of
the
recognition
of
southern
belligerency
here
was
a
correct
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
the
diplomatic
position
at
washington
and
a
permitted
avoidance
by
lyons
of
dangerous
ground
russell
was
not
then
aware
of
the
tenacity
with
which
seward
was
to
cling
to
a
theory
not
yet
clearly
formulated
for
foreign
governments
that
the
civil
war
was
a
rebellion
of
peoples
rather
than
a
conflict
of
governments
but
he
does
appear
to
have
understood
the
delicacy
of
formal
notification
to
the
constituted
government
at
washington
moreover
his
instructions
were
in
line
with
the
british
policy
of
refusing
at
present
a
recognition
of
southern
sovereignty
on
the
same
day
may
a
copy
of
the
instructions
to
lyons
was
sent
to
cowley
british
ambassador
at
paris
directing
him
to
request
france
to
join
promptly
in
recognizing
southern
belligerent
rights
cowley
was
also
instructed
that
the
blockade
and
privateering
required
precautions
by
european
governments
and
it
was
suggested
that
france
and
england
unite
in
requesting
both
belligerents
to
accede
to
the
second
and
third
articles
of
the
declaration
of
paris
these
articles
refer
to
the
exemption
from
capture
except
contraband
of
enemy
goods
under
a
neutral
flag
and
of
neutral
goods
under
an
enemy
flag
this
day
also
russell
stated
in
parliament
that
england
was
about
to
recognize
the
belligerent
rights
of
the
south
and
spoke
of
the
measure
as
a
necessary
and
inevitable
one
may
cowley
notified
russell
that
thouvenel
the
french
foreign
minister
was
in
complete
agreement
with
england
policy
and
on
may
in
a
more
extended
communication
cowley
sent
word
of
thouvenel
suggestion
that
both
powers
issue
a
declaration
that
they
intended
to
abstain
from
all
interference
and
that
de
flahault
french
ambassador
at
london
had
been
given
instructions
to
act
in
close
harmony
with
russell
the
rapidity
of
movement
in
formulating
policy
in
the
six
days
from
may
to
may
seems
to
have
taken
the
british
public
and
press
somewhat
by
surprise
for
there
is
a
lack
of
newspaper
comment
even
after
parliamentary
announcement
of
policy
on
the
date
but
on
may
the
set
the
fashion
of
general
approval
in
an
editorial
stating
that
great
britain
was
now
coming
to
see
the
american
conflict
in
a
new
light
as
a
conflict
where
there
were
in
fact
no
such
ideals
involved
as
had
been
earlier
attributed
to
it
southern
rights
were
now
more
clearly
understood
and
in
any
case
since
war
though
greatly
to
be
regretted
was
now
at
hand
it
was
england
business
to
keep
strictly
out
of
it
and
to
maintain
neutrality
this
generalization
was
no
doubt
satisfactory
to
the
public
but
in
the
government
and
in
parliament
men
who
were
thinking
seriously
of
specific
difficulties
realized
that
the
two
main
problems
immediately
confronting
a
british
neutral
policy
were
privateering
and
blockade
the
south
had
declared
its
to
use
privateers
the
north
had
declared
its
first
to
hang
those
who
engaged
in
privateering
and
second
to
establish
a
blockade
neither
declaration
had
as
yet
been
put
into
effect
the
first
action
of
the
british
government
was
directed
toward
privateering
on
may
russell
sent
a
note
to
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
calling
attention
to
the
southern
plan
to
issue
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
and
directing
that
reinforcements
be
sent
to
the
british
fleet
in
american
waters
this
was
prompt
action
on
unofficial
information
for
davis
proclamation
bore
date
of
april
and
despatch
containing
copies
of
it
sent
on
april
was
not
received
by
russell
until
may
ordinary
news
from
the
united
states
required
ten
days
to
get
into
print
in
london
but
official
messages
might
be
sent
more
rapidly
by
way
of
telegraph
to
halifax
thence
by
steamer
to
liverpool
and
by
telegraph
again
to
london
in
case
the
telegram
to
halifax
coincided
with
the
departure
of
a
fast
vessel
the
time
was
occasionally
reduced
to
seven
days
but
never
less
at
the
best
the
exact
information
as
to
the
contents
of
the
davis
and
lincoln
proclamations
of
april
and
respectively
could
have
been
received
only
a
few
days
before
the
order
was
issued
to
reinforce
the
british
fleet

sir
william
gregory
lady
gregory
sir
william
gregory
an
autobiography
by
kind
the
next
day
may
ewart
in
the
commons
asked
if
privateers
sailing
under
the
flag
of
an
unrecognized
power
will
be
dealt
with
as
pirates
thus
showing
the
immediate
parliamentary
concern
at
the
davis
and
lincoln
proclamations
russell
stated
in
reply
that
a
british
fleet
had
been
sent
to
protect
british
interests
and
took
occasion
to
indicate
british
policy
by
adding
we
have
not
been
involved
in
any
way
in
that
contest
by
any
act
or
giving
any
advice
in
the
matter
and
for
sake
let
us
if
possible
keep
out
of
it
may
gregory
a
friend
of
the
south
who
had
already
given
notice
of
a
motion
for
the
recognition
of
the
confederacy
as
an
independent
state
asked
whether
the
united
states
had
been
informed
that
a
blockade
of
southern
ports
would
not
be
recognized
unless
effective
and
whether
there
would
be
acquiescence
in
the
belligerent
right
of
the
south
to
issue
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
russell
replied
that
lincoln
had
been
informed
that
a
blockade
must
be
effective
to
be
respected
since
the
washington
government
did
not
need
to
be
told
of
an
international
rule
which
it
had
itself
long
proclaimed
as
to
the
second
point
he
now
announced
what
heretofore
had
not
been
clearly
stated
that
southern
privateers
could
not
be
regarded
by
great
britain
as
pirates
for
if
so
regarded
britain
would
herself
have
to
treat
them
as
pirates
and
would
thus
be
unneutral
this
was
in
fact
in
spite
of
northern
bitter
accusations
that
britain
was
exhibiting
governmental
sympathy
with
the
south
by
her
tolerance
of
the
plan
of
southern
privateering
an
inescapable
conclusion
russell
added
however
that
the
matter
of
privateering
involved
some
new
questions
under
the
declaration
of
paris
upon
which
the
government
had
not
yet
decided
what
stand
to
take
it
was
on
this
same
day
in
fact
that
russell
had
instructed
cowley
to
take
up
with
france
the
question
of
the
declaration
of
paris
privateering
and
blockade
declared
in
america
months
before
there
was
any
possibility
of
putting
them
into
effect
and
months
before
there
were
any
military
operations
in
the
field
forced
this
rapid
european
action
especially
the
action
of
great
britain
which
more
than
any
other
european
nation
feared
belligerent
interference
with
her
carrying
and
export
trade
how
was
the
british
government
to
know
that
davis
would
not
bend
every
energy
in
sending
out
privateers
and
lincoln
to
establish
a
blockade
the
respective
declarations
of
davis
and
lincoln
were
the
evidences
offered
of
belligerent
status
it
was
reasonable
to
assume
that
here
would
come
the
first
energetic
efforts
of
the
belligerents
nor
was
british
governmental
intelligence
sufficiently
informed
to
be
aware
that
davis
in
fact
controlled
few
ships
that
could
be
fitted
out
as
privateers
or
that
of
the
northern
navy
was
at
the
moment
widely
scattered
in
foreign
seas
making
impossible
a
prompt
blockade
to
the
british
view
the
immediate
danger
to
its
commercial
interests
lay
in
this
announced
maritime
war
and
it
felt
the
necessity
of
defining
its
neutral
position
with
speed
the
underlying
fact
of
the
fixity
of
southern
determination
to
maintain
secession
had
in
the
last
few
weeks
become
clearly
recognized
moreover
the
latest
information
sent
by
british
officials
in
america
some
of
it
received
just
before
the
issue
of
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
some
just
after
was
all
confirmative
of
the
rapid
approach
of
a
great
war
a
letter
from
bunch
at
charleston
was
received
on
may
depicting
the
united
southern
will
to
resist
northern
attack
and
asserting
that
the
south
had
no
purpose
save
to
conduct
a
strictly
defensive
war
bunch
was
no
longer
caustic
he
now
felt
that
a
new
nation
was
in
process
of
birth
may
monson
writing
from
washington
and
just
returned
from
a
trip
through
the
south
in
the
course
of
which
he
had
visited
montgomery
stated
of
the
union
is
possible
and
added
that
there
was
no
danger
of
a
servile
insurrection
a
matter
that
now
somewhat
began
to
disturb
the
british
government
and
public
a
few
days
later
on
may
lyons
expressed
his
strong
sympathy
with
the
north
for
reasons
of
law
and
race
but
added
that
he
shrank
from
expressions
of
sympathy
for
fear
of
thus
encouraging
the
northern
cabinet
in
its
plan
of
prosecuting
civil
war
since
such
a
war
would
be
frightful
in
its
consequences
both
to
america
and
to
england
such
reports
if
received
before
the
issue
of
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
must
have
strengthened
the
feeling
that
prompt
action
was
necessary
if
received
later
they
gave
confidence
that
that
action
had
been
wise
may
forster
asked
in
the
commons
a
series
of
questions
as
to
the
application
of
the
british
foreign
enlistment
act
in
the
american
crisis
what
would
be
the
status
of
british
citizens
serving
on
confederate
privateers
how
would
the
government
treat
citizens
who
aided
in
equipping
such
privateers
did
not
the
government
intend
to
take
measures
to
prevent
the
infringement
of
law
in
british
ports
here
was
pressure
by
a
friend
of
the
north
to
hasten
an
official
announcement
of
the
policy
already
notified
to
parliament
sir
george
lewis
replied
stating
that
the
government
was
about
to
issue
a
general
proclamation
warning
british
subjects
not
to
take
any
part
in
the
war
similar
questions
were
asked
by
derby
in
the
lords
on
may
and
received
a
similar
answer
the
few
days
delay
following
russell
statement
of
may
was
due
to
consideration
given
by
the
law
officers
to
the
exact
form
required
the
proclamation
as
issued
was
dated
may
and
was
officially
printed
in
the
on
may
in
form
and
in
substance
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
did
not
differ
from
customary
usage
it
spoke
of
the
confederacy
as
states
styling
themselves
the
confederate
states
of
america
prohibited
to
englishmen
enlistment
on
either
side
or
efforts
to
enlist
others
or
equipment
of
ships
of
war
or
delivery
of
commissions
to
such
ships
war
vessels
being
equipped
in
british
ports
would
be
seized
and
forfeited
to
the
british
government
if
a
belligerent
came
into
a
british
port
no
change
or
increase
of
equipment
was
to
be
permitted
if
a
subject
violated
the
proclamation
he
was
both
punishable
in
british
courts
and
forfeited
any
claim
to
british
protection
the
parliamentary
discussion
on
may
brought
out
more
clearly
and
in
general
unanimity
of
opinion
the
policy
of
the
government
in
application
of
the
proclamation
the
south
was
definitely
recognized
as
a
belligerent
but
recognition
of
independence
was
for
the
future
to
determine
the
right
of
the
south
to
send
out
privateers
was
regretfully
recognized
such
privateers
could
not
be
regarded
as
pirates
and
the
north
would
have
no
right
to
treat
them
as
such
but
if
the
north
in
defiance
of
international
opinion
did
so
treat
them
great
britain
had
at
least
warned
its
subjects
that
they
if
engaged
in
service
on
a
southern
privateer
had
no
claim
to
british
protection
a
blockade
of
the
south
to
be
respected
must
be
effective
at
least
to
the
point
where
a
vessel
attempting
to
pass
through
was
likely
to
be
captured
the
plan
of
blockading
the
entire
southern
coast
with
its
three
thousand
miles
of
coast
line
was
on
the
face
of
it
ridiculous
evidence
that
members
of
parliament
were
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
physical
geography
of
the
southern
seaboard
the
parliamentary
discussion
did
not
reveal
any
partiality
for
one
side
in
the
american
quarrel
above
the
other
it
turned
wholly
on
legal
questions
and
their
probable
application
on
may
russell
sent
to
lyons
the
official
text
of
the
proclamation
but
did
not
instruct
him
to
communicate
it
officially
to
seward
leaving
this
rather
to
discretion
this
was
discretionary
in
diplomatic
usage
since
in
strict
fact
the
proclamation
was
addressed
to
british
subjects
and
need
not
be
communicated
officially
to
the
belligerents
in
the
result
the
discretion
permitted
to
lyons
had
an
important
bearing
for
recognition
of
southern
belligerency
was
opposed
to
the
theory
upon
which
the
northern
government
was
attempting
to
proceed
lyons
did
not
then
or
later
make
official
communication
to
seward
of
the
proclamation
the
fact
soon
appeared
that
the
united
states
seriously
objected
to
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
protesting
first
its
having
been
issued
at
all
and
in
the
second
place
resenting
what
was
considered
its
premature
announcement
by
a
friendly
nation
this
matter
developed
so
serious
a
criticism
by
both
american
government
and
public
both
during
and
after
the
civil
war
that
it
requires
a
close
examination
did
the
british
government
exhibit
an
unfriendly
attitude
toward
the
north
by
a
premature
proclamation
of
neutrality
on
may
the
new
american
minister
landed
at
liverpool
and
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
he
was
ready
for
business
in
london
but
the
interview
with
russell
arranged
for
that
day
by
dallas
was
prevented
by
the
illness
of
russell
brother
the
duke
of
bedford
all
that
was
immediately
possible
was
to
make
official
notification
of
arrival
and
to
secure
the
customary
audience
with
the
queen
this
was
promptly
arranged
and
on
may
adams
was
presented
palmerston
attending
in
the
enforced
absence
of
russell
adams
first
report
to
seward
was
therefore
brief
merely
noting
that
public
opinion
was
not
exactly
what
we
would
wish
in
this
he
referred
to
the
utterances
of
the
press
particularly
those
of
the
which
from
day
to
day
and
with
increasing
vigour
sounded
the
note
of
strict
neutrality
in
a
war
on
may
the
asserting
that
both
parties
in
america
were
bidding
for
english
support
summed
up
public
opinion
as
follows
we
have
been
told
in
fact
by
northern
politicians
that
it
does
not
become
us
to
be
indifferent
and
by
southern
leaders
that
they
are
half
inclined
to
become
british
once
more
both
sides
are
bidding
for
us
and
both
sides
have
their
partisans
over
here
on
such
perilous
ground
we
can
not
walk
too
warily
for
our
own
part
we
are
free
to
confess
that
the
march
of
events
has
induced
us
to
regard
the
dispute
as
a
more
commonplace
kind
of
quarrel
than
it
at
first
appeared
to
be
the
real
motives
of
the
belligerents
as
the
truth
transpires
appear
to
be
exactly
such
motives
as
have
caused
wars
in
all
times
and
countries
they
are
essentially
selfish
motives
that
is
to
say
they
are
based
upon
speculations
of
national
power
territorial
aggrandizement
political
advantage
and
commercial
gain
neither
side
can
claim
any
superiority
of
principle
or
any
peculiar
purity
of
patriotism
we
certainly
can
not
discover
in
these
arguments
anything
to
remove
the
case
from
the
common
category
of
national
or
monarchical
quarrels
the
representations
of
the
north
might
be
made
word
for
word
by
any
autocrat
or
conqueror
desirous
of
his
frontier
consolidating
his
empire
or
retaining
a
disaffected
province
in
subjection
the
manifestos
of
the
south
might
be
put
forth
by
any
state
desirous
of
terminating
an
unpleasant
connexion
or
exchanging
union
for
independence
it
is
just
such
a
question
as
has
been
left
times
out
of
mind
in
this
old
world
to
the
decision
of
the
sword
the
sword
will
be
the
arbitrator
in
the
new
world
too
but
the
event
teaches
us
plainly
enough
that
republics
and
democracies
enjoy
no
exemption
from
the
passions
and
follies
of
humanity
under
these
impressions
adams
presented
himself
on
may
for
his
first
interview
with
russell
he
stated
that
he
had
come
with
the
idea
that
there
was
little
to
do
beyond
the
duty
of
preserving
the
relations
actually
existing
between
the
two
nations
from
the
risk
of
being
unfavourably
affected
by
the
unfortunate
domestic
disturbances
prevailing
in
my
own
country
it
was
not
without
pain
that
i
was
compelled
to
admit
that
from
the
day
of
my
arrival
i
had
felt
in
the
proceedings
of
both
houses
of
parliament
in
the
language
of
her
ministers
and
in
the
tone
of
opinion
prevailing
in
private
circles
more
of
uncertainty
about
this
than
i
had
before
thought
possible
adams
then
inquired
whether
the
replies
given
by
russell
to
dallas
refusing
to
indicate
a
policy
as
to
recognition
of
the
south
implied
a
british
purpose
to
adopt
a
policy
which
would
have
the
effect
to
widen
if
not
to
make
irreparable
a
breach
between
north
and
south
which
we
believed
yet
to
be
entirely
manageable
by
ourselves
russell
here
replied
that
there
was
no
such
intention
he
had
simply
meant
to
say
to
dallas
that
the
british
government
were
not
disposed
in
any
way
to
interfere
to
this
adams
answered
that
it
was
deserving
of
grave
consideration
whether
great
caution
was
not
to
be
used
in
adopting
any
course
that
might
even
in
the
most
indirect
way
have
an
effect
to
encourage
the
hopes
of
the
disaffected
in
america
it
was
in
this
view
that
i
must
be
permitted
to
express
the
great
regret
i
had
felt
on
learning
the
decision
to
issue
the
proclamation
which
at
once
raised
the
insurgents
to
the
level
of
a
belligerent
state
and
still
more
the
language
used
in
regard
to
it
by
her
majesty
ministers
in
both
houses
of
parliament
before
and
since
whatever
might
be
the
design
there
could
be
no
shadow
of
doubt
that
the
effect
of
these
events
had
been
to
encourage
the
friends
of
the
disaffected
here
the
tone
of
the
press
and
of
private
opinion
indicated
it
strongly
russell
answer
was
that
adams
was
placing
more
stress
on
recent
events
than
they
deserved
the
government
had
taken
the
advice
of
the
law
officers
and
as
a
result
had
concluded
that
as
a
question
merely
of
a
war
existed
under
such
circumstances
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
to
avoid
speaking
of
this
in
the
technical
sense
as
that
is
a
war
of
two
sides
without
in
any
way
implying
an
opinion
of
its
justice
as
well
as
to
withhold
an
endeavour
so
far
as
possible
to
bring
the
management
of
it
within
the
rules
of
modern
civilized
warfare
this
was
all
that
was
contemplated
by
the
queen
proclamation
it
was
designed
to
show
the
purport
of
existing
laws
and
to
explain
to
british
subjects
their
liabilities
in
case
they
should
engage
in
the
war
to
this
adams
answered
that
under
other
circumstances
i
should
be
very
ready
to
give
my
cheerful
assent
to
this
view
of
his
lordship
but
i
must
be
permitted
frankly
to
remark
that
the
action
taken
seemed
at
least
to
my
mind
a
little
more
rapid
than
was
absolutely
called
for
by
the
occasion
and
furthermore
it
pronounced
the
insurgents
to
be
a
belligerent
state
before
they
had
ever
shown
their
capacity
to
maintain
any
kind
of
warfare
whatever
except
within
one
of
their
own
harbours
and
under
every
possible
advantage
it
considered
them
a
marine
power
before
they
had
ever
exhibited
a
single
privateer
on
the
ocean
the
rule
was
very
clear
that
whenever
it
became
apparent
that
any
organized
form
of
society
had
advanced
so
far
as
to
prove
its
power
to
defend
and
protect
itself
against
the
assaults
of
enemies
and
at
the
same
time
to
manifest
a
capacity
to
maintain
binding
relations
with
foreign
nations
then
a
measure
of
recognition
could
not
be
justly
objected
to
on
any
side
the
case
was
very
different
when
such
an
interference
should
take
place
prior
to
the
establishment
of
the
proof
required
as
to
bring
about
a
result
which
would
not
probably
have
happened
but
for
that
external
agency
this
representation
by
the
american
minister
thus
early
made
contains
the
whole
argument
advanced
against
the
british
proclamation
of
neutrality
though
there
were
many
similar
representations
made
at
greater
length
both
by
adams
later
and
by
seward
at
washington
they
are
all
well
summarized
by
bernard
as
a
rejection
of
the
proposition
that
the
existence
of
war
is
a
simple
matter
of
fact
to
be
ascertained
as
other
facts
are
and
an
assertion
of
the
dogma
that
there
can
be
no
war
so
far
as
foreign
nations
are
concerned
and
therefore
no
neutrality
so
long
as
there
is
a
sovereignty
but
in
this
first
representation
adams
in
the
main
laid
stress
upon
the
with
which
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
had
been
issued
and
by
inference
upon
the
evidence
that
british
sympathies
were
with
the
south
one
british
journal
was
indeed
at
this
very
moment
voicing
exactly
those
opinions
advanced
by
adams
the
declared
that
while
the
proclamation
on
the
face
of
it
appeared
to
be
one
of
strict
neutrality
it
in
reality
tended
directly
to
the
benefit
of
the
south
a
fortnight
later
this
paper
asserted
the
quarrel
cover
it
with
cotton
as
we
may
is
between
freedom
and
slavery
right
and
wrong
the
dominion
of
god
and
the
dominion
of
the
devil
and
the
duty
of
england
we
submit
is
clear
she
should
even
though
forced
to
declare
her
neutrality
refuse
for
all
time
to
recognize
the
confederacy
but
the
stood
nearly
alone
in
this
view
the
defended
in
every
respect
the
issue
of
the
proclamation
and
added
in
a
short
time
it
will
be
necessary
further
to
recognize
the
legitimacy
of
the
southern
government
but
the
united
states
have
a
right
to
require
that
the
acknowledgment
shall
be
postponed
until
the
failure
of
the
effort
which
they
assert
or
believe
that
they
are
about
to
make
has
resulted
in
an
experimental
proof
that
subjugation
is
impossible
a
few
provincial
papers
supported
the
view
of
the
but
they
were
of
minor
importance
and
generally
the
press
heartily
approved
the
proclamation
at
the
time
of
adams
interview
with
russell
on
may
he
has
just
received
an
instruction
from
seward
written
under
the
impression
aroused
by
dallas
report
of
russell
refusal
on
april
to
make
any
pledge
as
to
british
policy
on
the
recognition
of
southern
independence
seward
was
very
much
disturbed
by
what
russell
had
said
to
dallas
in
this
instruction
dated
april
he
wrote
when
you
shall
have
read
the
instructions
at
large
which
have
been
sent
to
you
you
will
hardly
need
to
be
told
that
these
last
remarks
of
his
lordship
are
by
no
means
satisfactory
to
this
government
her
britannic
government
is
at
liberty
to
choose
whether
it
will
retain
the
friendship
of
this
government
by
refusing
all
aid
and
comfort
to
its
enemies
now
in
flagrant
rebellion
against
it
as
we
think
the
treaties
existing
between
the
two
countries
require
or
whether
the
government
of
her
majesty
will
take
the
precarious
benefits
of
a
different
course
you
will
lose
no
time
in
making
known
to
her
britannic
majesty
government
that
the
president
regards
the
answer
of
his
lordship
as
possibly
indicating
a
policy
that
this
government
would
be
obliged
to
deem
injurious
to
its
rights
and
derogating
from
its
dignity
having
promptly
carried
out
these
instructions
as
he
understood
them
adams
soon
began
to
report
an
improved
british
attitude
and
especially
in
the
government
stating
that
this
improvement
was
due
in
part
to
the
vigour
now
being
shown
by
the
northern
government
in
part
to
a
sense
that
the
preceding
action
of
her
majesty
ministers
has
been
construed
to
mean
more
than
they
intended
by
it
but
at
washington
the
american
irritation
was
not
so
easily
allayed
lyons
was
reporting
seward
and
indeed
the
whole
north
as
very
angry
with
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
on
june
lyons
had
a
long
conversation
with
seward
in
which
the
latter
stubbornly
denied
that
the
south
could
possess
any
belligerent
rights
lyons
left
the
conference
feeling
that
seward
was
trying
to
divide
france
and
england
on
this
point
and
lyons
was
himself
somewhat
anxious
because
france
was
so
long
delaying
her
own
proclamation
to
meet
the
situation
he
and
mercier
the
french
minister
went
the
next
day
june
on
an
official
visit
to
seward
with
the
intention
of
formally
presenting
the
british
proclamation
and
thouvenel
instructions
to
mercier
to
support
it
but
seward
said
at
once
that
he
could
not
receive
from
us
a
communication
founded
on
the
assumption
that
the
southern
rebels
were
to
be
regarded
as
belligerents
that
this
was
a
determination
to
which
the
cabinet
had
come
deliberately
that
he
could
not
admit
that
recent
events
had
in
any
respect
altered
the
relations
between
foreign
powers
and
the
southern
states
that
he
would
not
discuss
the
question
with
us
but
that
he
should
give
instructions
to
the
united
states
ministers
in
london
and
paris
who
would
thus
be
enabled
to
state
the
reasons
for
the
course
taken
by
their
government
to
your
lordship
and
to
thouvenel
if
you
should
be
desirous
to
hear
them
he
should
not
take
official
cognizance
of
the
recognition
of
the
belligerent
rights
of
southern
rebels
by
great
britain
and
france
unless
he
should
be
forced
to
do
so
by
an
official
communication
addressed
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
itself
in
the
result
the
two
ministers
submitted
their
papers
to
seward
for
his
own
use
only
they
did
not
regard
the
moment
well
chosen
to
be
punctilious
lyons
reported
that
seward
language
and
demeanour
throughout
the
interview
were
calm
friendly
and
good
humoured
but
the
fact
remained
that
the
united
states
had
not
been
officially
notified
of
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
and
that
the
american
government
sensitive
to
popular
excitement
in
the
matter
and
committed
to
the
theory
of
a
rebellion
of
peoples
was
thus
left
free
to
continue
argument
in
london
without
any
necessity
of
making
formal
protest
and
of
taking
active
steps
to
support
such
protest
the
official
relation
was
eased
by
the
conciliatory
acquiescence
of
lyons
the
public
anger
of
america
expressed
in
her
newspapers
astonished
the
british
press
and
temporarily
made
them
more
careful
in
comment
on
american
affairs
the
told
its
readers
to
keep
cool
it
is
plain
that
the
utmost
care
and
circumspection
must
be
used
by
every
man
or
party
in
england
to
avoid
giving
offence
to
either
of
the
two
incensed
belligerents
in
answer
to
the
northern
outcry
at
the
lack
of
british
sympathy
it
declared
neutrality
strict
neutrality
is
all
that
the
united
states
government
can
claim
while
the
burden
of
american
criticism
was
thus
directed
toward
the
british
recognition
of
southern
belligerency
there
were
two
other
matters
of
great
moment
to
the
american
view
the
attitude
of
the
british
government
toward
southern
privateers
and
the
hearing
given
by
russell
to
the
confederate
envoys
on
the
former
seward
on
may
wrote
to
adams
as
to
the
treatment
of
privateers
in
the
insurgent
service
you
will
say
that
this
is
a
question
exclusively
our
own
we
treat
them
as
pirates
they
are
our
own
citizens
or
persons
employed
by
our
own
citizens
preying
on
the
commerce
of
our
country
if
great
britain
shall
choose
to
recognize
them
as
lawful
belligerents
and
give
them
shelter
from
our
pursuit
and
punishment
the
law
of
nations
affords
an
adequate
and
proper
remedy
this
was
threatening
language
but
was
for
adams
own
eye
and
in
the
next
sentence
of
his
letter
seward
stated
that
avoidance
of
friction
on
this
point
was
easy
since
in
great
britain
had
invited
the
united
states
to
adhere
to
the
declaration
of
paris
everywhere
abolishing
privateering
and
to
this
the
united
states
was
now
ready
to
accede
what
seward
really
meant
to
accomplish
by
this
was
not
made
clear
for
the
question
of
privateering
did
not
constitute
the
main
point
of
his
belligerent
letter
of
may
in
fact
the
proposed
treatment
of
privateers
as
pirates
might
have
resulted
in
very
serious
complications
for
though
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
had
warned
british
subjects
that
they
would
forfeit
any
claim
to
protection
if
they
engaged
in
the
conflict
it
is
obvious
that
the
hanging
as
a
pirate
of
a
british
seaman
would
have
aroused
a
national
outcry
almost
certain
to
have
forced
the
government
into
protest
and
action
against
america
fortunately
the
cooler
judgment
of
the
united
states
soon
led
to
quiet
abandonment
of
the
plan
of
treating
privateers
as
pirates
while
on
the
other
point
of
giving
shelter
to
confederate
privateers
seward
himself
received
from
lyons
assurance
even
before
adams
had
made
a
protest
that
no
such
shelter
would
be
available
in
british
ports
in
this
same
letter
of
may
seward
writing
of
the
rumour
that
the
southern
envoys
were
to
be
received
by
russell
unofficially
instructed
adams
that
he
must
use
efforts
to
stop
this
and
that
you
will
in
any
event
desist
from
all
intercourse
whatever
unofficial
as
well
as
official
with
the
british
government
so
long
as
it
shall
continue
intercourse
of
either
kind
with
the
domestic
enemies
of
this
country
here
was
a
positive
instruction
as
to
the
american
conduct
in
a
given
situation
and
a
very
serious
instruction
nearly
equivalent
to
taking
leave
after
a
rupture
of
diplomatic
relations
but
the
method
to
be
used
in
avoiding
if
possible
the
necessity
of
the
serious
step
was
left
to
adams
discretion
well
might
adams
comment
when
reporting
the
outcome
that
this
was
the
most
delicate
portion
of
my
task
adams
again
went
over
with
russell
the
suspicion
as
to
british
intentions
aroused
in
america
by
the
queen
proclamation
but
added
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
convince
himself
of
the
existence
of
an
unfriendly
design
but
it
was
not
to
be
disguised
that
the
fact
of
the
continued
stay
of
the
in
this
city
and
still
more
the
knowledge
that
they
had
been
admitted
to
more
or
less
interviews
with
his
lordship
was
calculated
to
excite
uneasiness
indeed
it
had
already
given
great
dissatisfaction
to
my
government
i
added
as
moderately
as
i
could
that
in
all
frankness
any
further
protraction
of
this
relation
could
scarcely
fail
to
be
viewed
by
us
as
hostile
in
spirit
and
to
require
some
corresponding
action
accordingly
russell
replied
that
both
france
and
england
had
long
been
accustomed
to
receive
such
persons
unofficially
as
in
the
case
of
poles
hungarians
italians
to
hear
what
they
had
to
say
but
this
did
not
imply
recognition
in
their
case
any
more
than
in
ours
he
added
that
he
had
seen
the
gentlemen
once
some
time
ago
and
once
more
some
time
since
he
had
no
expectation
of
seeing
them
any
more
for
the
moment
then
a
matter
which
under
seward
instructions
might
have
brought
on
a
serious
crisis
was
averted
by
the
tact
of
adams
and
the
acquiescence
of
russell
yet
no
pledge
had
been
given
russell
merely
stated
that
he
had
no
expectation
of
further
interviews
with
the
southern
commissioners
he
was
still
ready
to
hear
from
them
in
writing
this
caused
a
division
of
opinion
between
the
commissioners
yancey
argued
that
russell
concession
to
adams
was
itself
a
violation
of
the
neutrality
the
british
government
had
announced
and
that
it
should
be
met
by
a
formal
protest
but
the
other
members
insisted
on
a
reference
to
richmond
for
instructions
on
the
same
day
that
adams
reported
the
result
to
seward
he
wrote
privately
to
his
son
in
boston
my
position
here
thus
far
has
not
been
difficult
or
painful
if
i
had
followed
the
course
of
some
of
my
colleagues
in
the
diplomatic
line
this
country
might
have
been
on
the
high
road
to
the
confederate
camp
before
now
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
expedient
so
to
play
into
the
hands
of
our
opponents
although
there
has
been
and
is
more
or
less
of
sympathy
with
the
in
certain
circles
they
are
not
so
powerful
as
to
overbear
the
general
sentiment
of
the
people
the
ministry
has
been
placed
in
rather
delicate
circumstances
when
a
small
loss
of
power
on
either
extreme
would
have
thrown
them
out
in
adams
opinion
the
liberals
were
on
the
whole
more
friendly
at
least
to
the
north
than
were
the
conservatives
and
he
therefore
considered
it
best
not
to
press
too
harshly
upon
the
government
but
the
concluding
sentence
of
this
same
letter
was
significant
i
wait
with
patience
but
as
yet
i
have
not
gone
so
far
as
to
engage
a
house
for
more
than
a
month
at
a
time
he
might
himself
be
inclined
to
view
more
leniently
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
and
be
able
to
find
excuses
for
the
alleged
haste
with
which
it
had
been
issued
but
his
instructions
required
strong
representations
especially
on
the
latter
point
adams
report
to
seward
of
june
just
noted
on
the
interview
with
russell
of
june
after
treating
of
privateering
and
the
southern
commissioners
turns
in
greater
length
to
the
alleged
pledge
of
delay
given
by
russell
to
dallas
and
to
the
violation
of
that
pledge
in
a
hasty
issue
of
the
proclamation
he
renews
attack
on
the
line
already
taken
on
may
from
this
time
on
throughout
and
after
the
war
this
criticism
was
repeatedly
made
and
with
increasing
bitterness
british
friends
of
the
north
joined
in
the
american
outcry
by
mere
reiteration
it
became
in
the
popular
mind
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
an
accepted
and
evidence
of
british
governmental
unfriendliness
in
may
at
the
conclusion
of
the
civil
war
john
bright
in
parliament
commenting
on
the
causes
of
american
declared
that
the
government
of
knowing
that
adams
was
on
his
way
should
in
mere
courtesy
have
waited
his
arrival
then
said
bright
the
proclamation
entirely
justifiable
in
itself
might
have
been
issued
without
offence
and
without
embittering
the
united
states
had
in
fact
a
pledge
to
wait
been
given
to
dallas
and
was
the
proclamation
hasty
and
premature
russell
always
denied
he
had
given
any
such
pledge
and
the
text
of
dallas
report
of
the
interview
of
may
would
seem
to
support
that
denial
on
that
day
russell
for
the
second
time
told
dallas
that
england
would
not
commit
herself
as
yet
as
regards
southern
recognition
clearly
meaning
a
recognition
of
not
of
belligerency
and
immediately
asked
dallas
what
the
rumours
of
a
blockade
meant
dallas
replied
that
he
had
no
information
on
this
point
and
russell
acquiesced
in
the
expediency
of
disregarding
mere
rumour
and
waiting
the
full
knowledge
to
be
brought
by
my
successor
the
motion
therefore
of
gregory
may
be
further
postponed
at
his
lordship
suggestion
the
unprejudiced
interpretation
of
this
report
is
merely
that
russell
refrained
from
pressing
dallas
about
a
matter
blockade
of
which
dallas
knew
nothing
agreeing
that
this
would
be
explained
by
adams
and
especially
that
he
let
dallas
understand
that
gregory
motion
which
was
one
for
the
independence
and
sovereignty
of
the
would
be
postponed
if
there
was
a
pledge
here
it
was
a
pledge
not
to
recognize
southern
sovereignty
until
after
adams
arrival
but
even
if
there
was
no
promise
of
delay
there
can
be
no
question
writes
the
son
of
adams
in
a
brief
biography
of
his
father
that
the
proclamation
of
the
was
issued
with
unseemly
haste
the
purpose
was
manifest
it
was
to
have
the
status
of
the
confederacy
as
a
belligerent
an
accomplished
fact
before
the
arrival
of
the
newly
accredited
minister
this
precipitate
action
was
chiefly
significant
as
indicating
an
animus
that
animus
being
really
based
on
the
belief
already
matured
into
a
conviction
that
the
full
recognition
of
the
confederacy
as
an
independent
power
was
merely
a
question
of
time
and
probably
of
a
very
short
time
the
author
does
not
however
support
the
contemporary
american
contention
that
proclamation
was
contrary
to
international
custom
and
that
no
recognition
of
belligerent
status
was
permissible
to
neutrals
until
the
insurgents
had
forced
the
mother
country
itself
to
recognize
the
division
as
fully
accomplished
even
while
war
still
continued
indeed
american
practice
was
flatly
contradictory
of
the
argument
as
in
the
very
pertinent
example
of
the
petty
canadian
rebellion
of
when
president
van
buren
had
promptly
issued
a
proclamation
of
neutrality
it
is
curious
that
in
his
several
replies
to
seward
complaints
russell
did
not
quote
a
letter
from
stevenson
the
american
minister
to
london
addressed
to
palmerston
may
stevenson
was
demanding
disavowal
and
disapproval
of
the
caroline
affair
and
incidentally
he
asserted
as
an
incontrovertible
principle
that
civil
wars
are
not
distinguished
from
other
wars
as
to
belligerent
and
neutral
rights
that
they
stand
upon
the
same
ground
and
are
governed
by
the
same
principles
that
whenever
a
portion
of
a
state
seek
by
force
of
arms
to
overthrow
the
government
and
maintain
independence
the
contest
becomes
one
of
war
this
was
as
exact
and
correct
a
statement
of
the
british
view
as
could
have
been
desired
the
american
minister
whatever
his
official
representation
did
not
then
hold
privately
the
view
of
unfriendly
animus
on
july
his
secretary
son
wrote
the
english
are
really
on
our
side
of
that
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
later
he
was
less
sure
of
this
but
they
thought
that
as
a
dissolution
seemed
inevitable
and
as
we
seemed
to
have
made
up
our
minds
to
it
that
their
proclamation
was
just
the
thing
to
keep
them
straight
with
both
sides
and
when
it
turned
out
otherwise
they
did
their
best
to
correct
their
mistake
the
modern
historical
judgment
of
the
best
american
writers
likewise
exonerates
the
british
government
of
unfriendly
animus
but
is
still
apt
to
refer
to
the
premature
issue
of
the
proclamation
this
was
also
john
bright
view
but
can
russell
and
the
government
be
criticized
even
as
exercising
an
unwise
not
unfriendly
haste
henry
adams
wrote
that
the
british
thought
the
dissolution
seemed
inevitable
and
we
seemed
to
have
made
up
our
minds
to
it
certainly
this
was
a
justifiable
conclusion
from
the
events
in
america
from
election
in
november
to
his
inauguration
in
march
and
even
to
a
later
date
almost
in
fact
to
the
first
week
in
april
during
this
period
the
british
ministry
preserved
a
strictly
hands
off
policy
then
suddenly
actual
conflict
begins
and
at
once
each
side
in
america
issues
declarations
davis
on
privateering
lincoln
on
blockade
and
piracy
indicative
that
war
the
form
of
war
at
once
most
dangerous
to
british
interests
and
most
likely
to
draw
in
british
citizens
was
the
method
first
to
be
tried
by
the
contestants
unless
these
declarations
were
mere
bluff
and
bluster
england
could
not
dare
wait
their
application
she
must
at
once
warn
her
citizens
and
make
clear
her
position
as
a
neutral
the
proclamation
was
no
effort
to
keep
straight
with
both
sides
it
was
simply
the
natural
direct
and
prompt
notification
to
british
subjects
required
in
the
presence
of
a
war
moreover
merely
as
a
matter
of
historical
speculation
it
was
fortunate
that
the
proclamation
antedated
the
arrival
of
adams
the
theory
of
the
northern
administration
under
which
the
civil
war
was
begun
and
concluded
was
that
a
portion
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
striving
as
insurgents
to
throw
off
their
allegiance
and
that
there
could
be
no
recognition
of
any
southern
in
the
conflict
in
actual
practice
in
war
the
exchange
of
prisoners
and
like
matters
this
theory
had
soon
to
be
discarded
yet
it
was
a
and
wise
theory
nevertheless
in
looking
forward
to
the
purely
domestic
and
constitutional
problem
of
the
return
to
the
union
when
conquered
of
the
sections
in
rebellion
this
unfortunately
was
not
clear
to
foreign
nations
and
it
necessarily
complicated
relations
with
them
yet
under
that
theory
adams
had
to
act
had
he
arrived
before
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
he
could
have
proceeded
otherwise
than
to
protest
officially
against
any
british
declaration
of
neutrality
declaring
that
his
government
did
not
acknowledge
a
state
of
war
as
existing
and
threatening
to
take
his
leave
it
would
have
been
his
duty
to
if
possible
the
issue
of
the
proclamation
dallas
fortunately
had
been
left
uninformed
and
uninstructed
adams
fortunately
arrived
too
late
to
prevent
and
had
therefore
merely
to
complain
the
premature
issue
of
the
proclamation
averted
an
inevitable
rupture
of
relations
on
a
clash
between
the
american
theory
of
no
state
of
war
and
the
international
fact
that
war
existed
had
that
rupture
occurred
how
long
would
the
british
government
and
people
have
remained
neutral
and
what
would
have
been
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
united
states

an

a

audience
to

begging
them
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
calm
impartiality
on

he
issued
the
first
of
several
neutrality
proclamations
in
which
following
the
customary
language
of
such
documents
the
people
were
notified
that
neutrality
did
not
restrict
the
full
and
free
expression
of
sympathies
in
public
and
in
private
but
on
august
in
an
address
to
the
people
of
the
united

this
legal
phraseology
required
by
traditional
usage
was
negatived
by
wilson
appeal
that
we
must
be
impartial
in
thought
as
well
as
in
action
must
put
a
curb
upon
our
sentiments
as
well
as

that
might
be
construed
as
a

of

the

against

commissioners
were
all
unjustifiable

and
as

he

british
suspicion

the
incidents
narrated
in
the
preceding
chapter
have
been
considered
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
formal
american
contention
as
to
correct
international
practice
and
the
british
answer
to
that
contention
in
fact
however
there
were
intimately
connected
wth
these
formal
arguments
and
instructions
of
the
american
secretary
of
state
a
plan
of
possible
militant
action
against
great
britain
and
a
suspicion
in
british
governmental
circles
that
this
plan
was
being
rapidly
matured
american
historians
have
come
to
stigmatize
this
plan
as
seward
foreign
war
panacea
and
it
has
been
examined
by
them
in
great
detail
so
that
there
is
no
need
here
to
do
more
than
state
its
main
features
that
which
is
new
in
the
present
treatment
is
the
british
information
in
regard
to
the
plan
and
the
resultant
british
suspicion
of
seward
intentions
the
british
public
as
distinguished
from
the
government
deriving
its
knowledge
of
seward
from
newspaper
reports
of
his
career
and
past
utterances
might
well
consider
him
as
traditionally
unfriendly
to
great
britain
he
had
in
the
vigorously
attacked
the
british
interpretation
of
the
treaty
and
characterized
great
britain
as
the
most
grasping
and
the
most
rapacious
power
in
the
world
he
had
long
prophesied
the
ultimate
annexation
of
canada
to
the
united
states
he
had
not
disdained
in
political
struggles
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
whip
up
for
the
sake
of
votes
irish
antagonism
to
great
britain
and
more
especially
and
more
recently
he
had
been
reported
to
have
expressed
to
the
duke
of
newcastle
a
belief
that
civil
conflict
in
america
could
easily
be
avoided
or
quieted
by
fomenting
a
quarrel
with
england
and
engaging
in
a
war
against
her
earlier
expressions
might
easily
be
overlooked
as
emanating
from
a
politician
never
about
wounding
the
sensibilities
of
foreign
nations
and
peoples
for
he
had
been
even
more
outspoken
against
the
france
of
louis
napoleon
but
the
newcastle
conversation
stuck
in
the
british
mind
as
indicative
of
a
probable
animus
when
the
politician
had
become
the
statesman
responsible
for
foreign
policy
seward
might
deny
as
he
did
that
he
had
ever
uttered
the
words
alleged
and
his
friend
thurlow
weed
might
describe
the
words
as
badinage
in
a
letter
to
the
london
but
the
newcastle
story
continued
to
be
matter
for
frequent
comment
both
in
the
press
and
in
private
circles
british
ministers
however
would
have
paid
little
attention
to
speeches
intended
for
home
political
consumption
or
to
a
careless
bit
of
social
talk
had
there
not
been
suspicion
of
other
and
more
serious
evidences
of
unfriendliness
lyons
was
an
unusually
able
and
minister
and
from
the
first
he
had
pictured
the
leadership
of
seward
in
the
new
administration
at
washington
and
had
himself
been
worried
by
his
inability
to
understand
what
policy
seward
was
formulating
but
in
fact
he
did
not
see
clearly
what
was
going
on
in
the
camp
of
the
republican
party
now
dominant
in
the
north
the
essential
feature
of
the
situation
was
that
seward
generally
regarded
as
the
man
whose
wisdom
must
guide
the
lincoln
and
himself
thinking
this
to
be
his
destined
function
early
found
his
authority
challenged
by
other
leaders
and
his
policies
not
certain
of
acceptance
by
the
president
it

review

situation

was

by
a
definite
policy
the
important
immediate
question
was
as
to
whether
lincoln
had
a
policy
or
if
not
upon
whom
he
would
depend
to
guide
him
in
the
cabinet
were
two
men
who
in
popular
estimate
were
expected
to
take
the
lead
chase
of
ohio
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
seward
of
new
york
secretary
of
state
both
were
experienced
in
political
matters
and
both
stood
high
in
the
esteem
of
the
element
in
the
north
but
seward
all
things
considered
was
regarded
as
the
logical
leading
member
of
the
cabinet
he
had
been
the
favoured
candidate
for
republican
presidential
nomination
in
making
way
for
lincoln
only
on
the
theory
that
the
latter
as
less
radical
on
could
be
more
easily
elected
also
he
now
held
that
position
which
by
american
tradition
was
regarded
as
the
highest
in
the
cabinet
in
fact
everyone
at
washington
regarded
it
as
certain
that
seward
would
determine
the
policy
of
the
new
administration
seward
own
attitude
is
well
summed
up
in
a
despatch
to
his
government
february
by
rudolph
schleiden
minister
from
the
republic
of
bremen
he
described
a
conversation
with
seward
in
regard
to
his
relations
with
lincoln
seward
however
consoled
himself
with
the
clever
remark
that
there
is
no
great
difference
between
an
elected
president
of
the
united
states
and
an
hereditary
monarch
the
latter
is
called
to
the
throne
through
the
accident
of
birth
the
former
through
the
chances
which
make
his
election
possible
the
actual
direction
of
public
affairs
belongs
to
the
leader
of
the
ruling
party
here
as
well
as
in
any
hereditary
principality
the
future
president
is
a
man
and
there
is
therefore
as
little
doubt
of
his
energy
as
of
his
proverbial
honesty
old
abe
it
is
also
acknowledged
that
he
does
not
lack
common
sense
but
his
other
qualities
for
the
highest
office
are
practically
unknown
his
election
may
therefore
be
readily
compared
with
a
lottery
it
is
possible
that
the
united
states
has
drawn
the
first
prize
on
the
other
hand
the
gain
may
only
have
been
a
small
one
but
unfortunately
the
possibility
is
not
excluded
that
it
may
have
been
merely
a
blank
the
first
paragraph
of
this
quotation
reports
seward
opinion
the
second
is
apparently
schleiden
own
estimate
two
weeks
later
schleiden
sent
home
a
further
analysis
of
lincoln
he
makes
the
impression
of
a
natural
man
of
clear
and
healthy
mind
great
and
best
intentions
he
seems
to
be
fully
conscious
of
the
great
responsibility
which
rests
upon
him
but
at
the
same
time
it
appears
as
if
he
had
lost
some
of
his
famous
firmness
and
resoluteness
through
the
novelty
of
the
conditions
which
surround
him
and
the
hourly
renewed
attempts
from
various
sides
to
gain
influence
over
him
he
is
therefore
at
present
inclined
to
concede
double
weight
to
the
superior
political
experience
of
his
secretary
of
state
this
was
written
on
march
and
the
situation
was
correctly
described
seward
led
for
the
moment
but
his
supremacy
was
not
unchallenged
and
soon
a
decision
was
called
for
that
in
its
final
solution
was
to
completely
overthrow
his
already
matured
policy
towards
the
seceding
states
buchanan
had
been
pressed
by
south
carolina
to
yield
possession
of
federal
property
in
that
state
and
especially
to
withdraw
federal
troops
from
fort
sumter
in
charleston
harbour
after
some
vacillation
he
had
refused
to
do
this
but
had
taken
no
steps
to
reinforce
and
the
weak
garrison
under
the
command
of
major
anderson
on
march
lincoln
learned
that
sumter
would
soon
have
to
be
yielded
unless
reinforcements
were
sent
there
followed
ten
days
of
delay
and
indecision
then
on
march
lincoln
requested
from
each
member
of
his
cabinet
an
opinion
on
what
should
be
done
this
brought
to
an
issue
the
whole
question
of
seward
policy
and
leadership
for
seward
policy
like
that
of
buchanan
was
one
of
conciliatory
delay
taking
no
steps
to
bring
matters
to
an
issue
and
trusting
to
time
and
a
sobering
second
thought
to
bring
southern
leaders
and
people
to
a
less
violent
attitude
he
sincerely
believed
in
the
existence
of
an
as
yet
unvoiced
strong
union
sentiment
in
the
south
especially
in
those
states
which
were
wavering
on
secession
he
was
holding
communications
through
intermediaries
with
certain
confederate
commissioners
in
washington
and
he
had
agents
in
virginia
attempting
to
influence
that
state
against
secession
to
all
these
southern
representatives
he
now
conveyed
assurances
quite
without
warrant
from
lincoln
that
sumter
would
be
evacuated
acting
solely
in
the
belief
that
his
own
policy
would
be
approved
by
the
president
his
argument
in
reply
to
call
for
an
opinion
was
positive
against
reinforcing
fort
sumter
and
it
seemed
to
meet
for
the
moment
with
the
approval
of
the
majority
of
his
cabinet
colleagues
lincoln
himself
made
no
pertinent
comment
yet
did
not
commit
himself
there
the
matter
rested
for
a
time
for
the
confederate
commissioners
regarding
seward
policy
of
delay
as
wholly
beneficial
to
the
maturing
of
southern
plans
and
seward
as
their
did
not
care
to
press
for
a
decision
moreover
seward
had
given
a
personal
pledge
that
in
case
it
were
after
all
determined
to
reinforce
sumter
notification
of
that
determination
would
at
once
be
given
to
south
carolina
the
days
went
by
and
it
was
not
until
the
last
week
of
march
that
lincoln
disillusioned
as
to
the
feasibility
of
seward
policy
of
conciliation
reached
the
conclusion
that
in
his
conception
of
his
duty
as
president
of
the
united
states
he
must
defend
and
retain
federal
forts
or
attempt
to
retain
them
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
decided
to
reinforce
fort
sumter
on
march
the
cabinet
assembled
at
noon
and
learned
lincoln
determination
this
was
a
sharp
blow
to
seward
prestige
in
the
cabinet
it
also
threatened
his
peaceful
policy
yet
he
did
not
as
yet
understand
fully
that
either
supreme
leadership
or
control
of
policy
had
been
assumed
by
lincoln
on
april
he
drafted
that
astonishing
document
entitled
some
thoughts
for
the
president
consideration
which
at
once
reveals
his
alarm
and
his
supreme
personal
this
document
begins
we
are
at
the
end
of
a
month
administration
and
yet
without
a
policy
either
domestic
or
foreign
it
then
advocates
as
a
domestic
policy
the
question
before
the
public
from
one
upon
slavery
or
about
for
a
question
upon
or
then
in
a
second
section
headed
for
foreign
nations
there
followed
i
would
demand
explanations
from
spain
and
france
categorically
at
once
i
would
seek
explanations
from
great
britain
and
russia
and
send
agents
into
canada
mexico
and
central
america
to
rouse
a
vigorous
continental
spirit
of
independence
on
this
continent
against
european
intervention
and
if
satisfactory
explanations
are
not
received
from
spain
and
france
would
convene
congress
and
declare
war
against
them
but
whatever
policy
we
adopt
there
must
be
energetic
prosecution
of
it
for
this
purpose
it
must
be
somebody
business
to
pursue
and
direct
it
incessantly
either
the
president
must
do
it
himself
and
be
all
the
while
active
in
it
or
devolve
it
on
some
member
of
his
cabinet
once
adopted
debates
on
it
must
end
and
all
agree
and
abide
it
is
not
in
my
especial
province
but
i
neither
seek
to
evade
nor
assume
responsibility
lincoln
reply
of
the
same
day
april
was
characteristically
gentle
yet
no
less
positive
and
definite
to
any
save
one
obsessed
with
his
own
superior
wisdom
lincoln
merely
noted
that
seward
domestic
policy
was
exactly
his
own
except
that
he
did
not
intend
to
abandon
fort
sumter
as
to
the
warlike
foreign
policy
lincoln
pointed
out
that
this
would
be
a
sharp
reversal
of
that
already
being
prepared
in
circulars
and
instructions
to
ministers
abroad
this
was
indeed
the
case
for
the
first
instructions
soon
despatched
were
drawn
on
lines
of
recalling
to
foreign
powers
their
established
and
friendly
relations
with
the
united
states
finally
lincoln
stated
as
to
the
required
guiding
hand
i
remark
that
if
this
must
be
done
i
must
do
it
i
wish
and
suppose
i
am
entitled
to
have
the
advice
of
all
the
cabinet
this
should
have
been
clear
indication
of
lincoln
will
to
direct
affairs
and
even
to
seward
would
have
been
sufficient
had
he
not
momentarily
been
so
disturbed
by
the
wreck
of
his
pacific
policy
toward
the
south
and
as
yet
so
ignorant
of
the
strength
of
lincoln
quiet
persistence
as
it
was
he
yielded
on
the
immediate
issue
the
relief
of
sumter
though
attempting
to
divert
reinforcements
to
another
quarter
but
did
not
as
yet
wholly
yield
either
his
policy
of
conciliation
and
delay
nor
give
up
immediately
his
insane
scheme
of
saving
the
union
by
plunging
it
into
a
foreign
war
he
was
in
fact
still
giving
assurances
to
the
confederate
commissioners
through
indirect
channels
that
he
could
and
would
prevent
the
outbreak
of
civil
war
and
in
this
confidence
that
his
ideas
would
finally
control
lincoln
he
remained
up
to
the
second
week
in
april
but
on
april
the
first
of
the
ships
despatched
to
the
aid
of
sumter
left
new
york
and
on
that
day
governor
pickens
of
south
carolina
was
officially
notified
of
the
northern
purpose
this
threw
the
burden
of
striking
the
first
blow
upon
the
south
if
southern
threats
were
now
made
good
civil
war
seemed
inevitable
and
there
could
be
no
peaceful
decision
of
the
quarrel
the
reinforcements
did
not
arrive
in
time
fort
sumter
after
a
day
and
a
half
of
dogged
fighting
was
surrendered
to
the
enemy
on
april
for
as
an
enemy
in
arms
the
south
now
stood
the
fall
of
sumter
changed
as
in
a
moment
the
whole
attitude
of
the
northern
people
there
was
now
a
nearly
unanimous
cry
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
yet
seward
still
clung
privately
to
his
belief
that
even
now
the
sober
second
thought
of
the
south
would
offer
a
way
out
toward
reunion
without
war
in
official
utterances
and
acts
he
was
apparently
in
complete
harmony
with
the
popular
will
to
reconquer
the
south
proclamation
on
marque
and
privateering
of
april
was
answered
by
the
lincoln
blockade
proclamation
of
april
but
virginia
had
not
yet
officially
seceded
and
until
this
occurred
there
seemed
to
seward
at
least
one
last
straw
of
conciliation
available
in
this
situation
schleiden
minister
for
bremen
came
to
seward
on
the
morning
of
april
and
offered
his
services
as
a
mediator
schleiden
idea
was
that
an
armistice
be
agreed
upon
with
the
south
until
the
northern
congress
should
meet
in
july
thus
giving
a
breathing
spell
and
permitting
saner
second
judgment
to
both
sides
he
had
consulted
with
his
prussian
colleague
who
approved
and
he
found
seward
favourable
to
the
plan
alexander
stephens
of
the
confederacy
was
then
at
richmond
and
to
him
as
an
old
friend
schleiden
proposed
to
go
and
make
the
same
appeal
seward
at
once
took
schleiden
to
see
lincoln
the
three
men
with
chase
and
the
prussian
minister
were
the
only
ones
in
the
secret
lincoln
first
comment
was
that
he
was
willing
to
make
an
attempt
of
contributing
to
the
prevention
of
bloodshed
and
regretted
that
schleiden
had
not
gone
to
richmond
without
consulting
him
or
seward
lincoln
further
stated
that
he
did
not
have
in
mind
any
aggression
against
the
southern
states
but
merely
the
safety
of
the
government
in
the
capitol
and
the
possibility
to
govern
everywhere
a
concluding
phrase
that
should
have
enlightened
schleiden
as
to
lincoln
determination
to
preserve
the
union
lincoln
said
he
could
neither
authorize
negotiations
nor
invite
proposals
but
that
he
would
gladly
consider
any
such
proposals
voluntarily
made
schleiden
asked
for
a
definite
statement
as
to
whether
lincoln
would
recall
the
blockade
proclamation
and
sign
an
armistice
if
davis
would
recall
the
letters
of
marque
proclamation
but
lincoln
refused
to
commit
himself
this
was
scant
encouragement
from
the
president
but
seward
still
thought
something
might
result
from
the
venture
and
on
that
evening
april
schleiden
started
for
richmond
being
provided
by
seward
with
a
pass
through
the
union
lines
he
arrived
on
the
afternoon
of
the
but
even
before
reaching
the
city
was
convinced
that
his
mission
would
be
a
failure
all
along
his
journey
at
each
little
station
he
saw
excited
crowds
assembled
enthusiastic
for
secession
bands
of
militia
training
and
every
indication
of
preparation
for
war
already
on
that
same
day
the
virginia
secession
ordinance
had
been
published
and
the
state
convention
had
ratified
the
provisional
constitution
of
the
southern
confederacy
schleiden
immediately
notified
stephens
of
his
presence
in
richmond
and
desire
for
an
interview
and
was
at
once
received
the
talk
lasted
three
hours
stephens
was
frank
and
positive
in
asserting
the
belief
that
all
attempts
to
settle
peacefully
the
differences
between
the
two
sections
were
futile
formal
letters
were
exchanged
after
this
conference
but
in
these
the
extent
to
which
stephens
would
go
was
to
promise
to
use
his
influence
in
favour
of
giving
consideration
to
any
indication
made
by
the
north
of
a
desire
for
an
amicable
adjustment
of
the
questions
at
issue
and
he
was
positive
that
there
could
be
no
return
of
the
south
to
the
union
on
the
afternoon
of
april
schleiden
was
back
in
washington
he
found
that
three
days
had
made
a
great
change
in
the
sentiment
of
the
capitol
during
my
short
absence
he
wrote
many
thousands
of
volunteers
had
arrived
from
the
north
there
was
not
only
a
feeling
of
security
noticeable
but
even
of
combativeness
he
found
seward
not
at
all
disposed
to
pursue
the
matter
and
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
lincoln
therefore
he
merely
submitted
copies
of
the
letters
that
had
passed
between
him
and
stephens
adding
for
himself
that
the
south
was
arming
of
lincoln
proclamation
calling
for
volunteers
seward
replied
on
april
stating
his
personal
regards
and
that
he
had
no
fault
to
find
with
schleiden
efforts
but
concluding
that
letters
gave
no
ground
for
action
since
the
union
of
these
states
is
the
supreme
as
it
is
the
organic
law
of
this
country
and
must
be
maintained
this
adventure
to
richmond
by
the
minister
of
bremen
may
be
regarded
as
seward
last
struggle
to
carry
out
his
policy
of
conciliatory
delay
he
had
not
officially
sent
schleiden
to
richmond
but
he
had
grasped
eagerly
at
the
opening
and
had
encouraged
and
aided
schleiden
in
his
journey
now
by
april
hope
had
vanished
and
seward
domestic
policy
as
set
forth
in
his
thoughts
for
the
president
consideration
on
april
was
discredited
and
inevitably
in
some
measure
their
author
also
the
dates
are
important
in
appreciating
seward
purposes
on
april
the
day
of
return
to
washington
there
was
sent
to
adams
that
sharp
despatch
taking
issue
with
british
action
as
foreshadowed
by
dallas
on
april
and
concluding
by
instructing
adams
to
lose
no
time
in
warning
russell
that
such
action
would
be
regarded
by
the
united
states
as
injurious
to
its
rights
and
derogating
from
its
dignity
it
appears
therefore
that
seward
defeated
on
one
line
of
policy
eager
to
regain
prestige
and
still
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
some
means
could
yet
be
found
to
avert
domestic
conflict
was
on
april
beginning
to
pick
at
those
threads
which
to
his
excited
thought
might
yet
save
the
union
through
a
foreign
war
he
was
now
seeking
to
force
the
acceptance
of
the
second
and
alternative
portion
of
his
thoughts
for
the
president
seward
theory
of
the
cementing
effect
of
a
foreign
war
was
no
secret
at
washington
as
early
as
january
he
had
unfolded
to
schleiden
this
fantastic
plan
if
the
lord
would
only
give
the
united
states
an
excuse
for
a
war
with
england
france
or
spain
he
said
that
would
be
the
best
means
of
internal
peace
again
on
february
he
conversed
with
schleiden
on
the
same
topic
and
complained
that
there
was
no
foreign
complication
offering
an
excuse
for
a
break
lyons
knew
of
this
attitude
and
by
february
had
sent
russell
a
warning
to
which
the
latter
had
replied
on
february
that
england
could
afford
to
be
patient
for
a
time
but
that
too
much
blustering
demonstration
must
not
be
indulged
in
but
the
new
administration
as
lincoln
had
remarked
in
his
reply
to
seward
on
april
had
taken
quite
another
line
addressing
foreign
powers
in
terms
of
high
regard
for
established
friendly
relations
this
was
the
tone
of
seward
first
instruction
to
adams
april
in
the
concluding
paragraph
of
which
seward
wrote
the
united
states
are
not
indifferent
to
the
circumstances
of
common
descent
language
customs
sentiments
and
religion
which
recommend
a
closer
sympathy
between
themselves
and
great
britain
than
either
might
expect
in
its
intercourse
with
any
other
nation
true
on
this
basis
seward
claimed
a
special
sympathy
from
great
britain
for
the
united
states
that
is
to
say
the
north
but
most
certainly
the
tone
of
this
first
instruction
was
one
of
established
friendship
yet
now
april
merely
on
learning
from
dallas
that
russell
refuses
to
pledge
himself
on
british
policy
seward
resorts
to
threats
what
other
explanation
is
possible
except
that
seeking
to
save
his
domestic
policy
of
conciliation
and
to
regain
his
leadership
he
now
was
adventuring
toward
the
application
of
his
foreign
war
panacea
idea
lyons
quickly
learned
of
the
changed
tone
and
that
england
especially
was
to
hear
american
complaint
on
may
lyons
wrote
to
russell
in
cypher
characterizing
seward
as
arrogant
and
reckless
toward
foreign
powers
evidently
seward
was
making
little
concealment
of
his
belligerent
attitude
and
when
the
news
was
received
of
the
speeches
in
parliament
of
the
first
week
in
may
by
which
it
became
clear
that
great
britain
would
declare
neutrality
and
was
planning
joint
action
with
france
he
became
much
excited
on
may
he
wrote
a
letter
home
exhibiting
still
an
extraordinary
faith
in
his
own
wisdom
and
his
own
foreign
policy
a
country
so
largely
relying
on
my
poor
efforts
to
save
it
had
has
refused
me
the
full
measure
of
its
confidence
needful
to
that
end
i
am
a
chief
reduced
to
a
subordinate
position
and
surrounded
by
a
guard
to
see
that
i
do
not
do
too
much
for
my
country
lest
some
advantage
may
revert
indirectly
to
my
own
fame
they
have
misunderstood
things
fearfully
in
europe
great
britain
is
in
danger
of
sympathizing
so
much
with
the
south
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
cotton
as
to
drive
us
to
make
war
against
her
as
the
ally
of
the
traitors
i
am
trying
to
get
a
bold
remonstrance
through
the
cabinet
before
it
is
too
late
the
bold
remonstrance
was
the
famous
despatch
no
of
may
already
commented
upon
in
the
preceding
chapter
but
as
sent
to
adams
it
varied
in
very
important
details
from
the
draft
submitted
by
seward
to
lincoln
seward
draft
was
not
merely
a
remonstrance
it
was
a
challenge
its
language
implied
that
the
united
states
desired
war
and
seward
plan
was
to
have
adams
read
the
despatch
to
russell
give
him
a
copy
of
it
and
then
discontinue
diplomatic
relations
so
long
as
russell
held
either
official
or
unofficial
intercourse
with
the
southern
commissioners
this
last
instruction
was
indeed
retained
in
the
final
form
of
the
despatch
but
here
as
elsewhere
lincoln
modified
the
stiff
expressions
of
the
original
most
important
of
all
he
directed
adams
to
consider
the
whole
despatch
as
for
his
own
guidance
relying
on
his
discretion
the
despatch
as
amended
began
with
the
statement
that
the
united
states
neither
means
to
menace
great
britain
nor
to
wound
the
sensibilities
of
that
or
any
other
european
nation
the
paper
itself
is
not
to
be
read
or
shown
to
the
british
secretary
of
state
nor
any
of
its
positions
to
be
prematurely
unnecessarily
or
indiscreetly
made
known
but
its
spirit
will
be
your
guide
thus
were
the
teeth
skilfully
drawn
from
the
threat
of
war
even
the
positive
instructions
later
in
the
despatch
as
to
the
southern
commissioners
need
not
have
been
acted
upon
by
adams
had
he
not
thought
it
wise
to
do
so
but
even
with
alterations
the
american
remonstrance
was
so
bold
as
to
alarm
adams
on
first
perusual
he
wrote
in
his
diary
june
the
government
seems
almost
ready
to
declare
war
with
all
the
powers
of
europe
and
almost
instructs
me
to
withdraw
from
communication
with
the
ministers
here
in
a
certain
contingency
i
scarcely
know
how
to
understand
seward
the
rest
of
the
government
may
be
demented
for
all
i
know
but
he
surely
is
calm
and
wise
my
duty
here
is
in
so
far
as
i
can
do
it
honestly
to
prevent
the
irritation
from
coming
to
a
downright
quarrel
it
seems
to
me
like
throwing
the
game
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
adams
a
sincere
admirer
of
seward
was
in
error
as
to
the
source
of
american
belligerent
attitude
fortunately
his
judgment
of
what
was
wise
at
the
moment
coincided
with
that
of
lincoln
though
of
this
he
had
no
knowledge
in
the
event
adams
skilful
handling
of
the
situation
resulted
favourably
even
to
the
cessation
of
intercourse
between
russell
and
the
southern
commissioners
for
his
part
lincoln
no
more
than
earlier
was
to
be
hurried
into
foreign
complications
and
foreign
war
panacea
was
stillborn
the
incident
was
a
vital
one
in
the
northern
administration
for
seward
at
last
realized
that
the
president
intended
to
control
policy
and
though
it
was
yet
long
before
he
came
to
appreciate
fully
customary
calm
judgment
he
did
understand
the
relation
now
established
between
himself
and
his
chief
henceforth
he
obeyed
orders
though
free
in
suggestion
and
criticism
always
welcome
to
lincoln
the
latter
avowedly
ignorant
of
diplomacy
gladly
left
details
to
seward
and
the
altered
despatch
far
from
making
relations
difficult
rendered
them
simple
and
easy
by
clearing
the
atmosphere
but
it
was
otherwise
with
foreign
ministers
at
washington
for
even
though
there
was
soon
a
leak
of
gossip
informing
them
of
what
had
taken
place
in
regard
to
despatch
no
they
one
and
all
were
fearful
of
a
recovery
of
influence
by
seward
and
of
a
resumption
of
belligerent
policy
this
was
particularly
true
of
lord
lyons
for
rumour
had
it
that
it
was
against
england
that
seward
most
directed
his
enmity
there
resulted
for
british
diplomats
both
at
washington
and
in
london
a
suspicion
of
seward
long
after
he
had
made
a
complete
in
policy
this
suspicion
influenced
relations
greatly
in
the
earlier
years
of
the
civil
war
on
may
the
day
before
seward
no
was
dated
lyons
wrote
a
long
despatch
to
russell
anxious
and
very
full
of
warlike
projects
the
president
is
of
course
wholly
ignorant
of
foreign
countries
and
of
foreign
affairs
seward
having
lost
strength
by
the
failure
of
his
peace
policy
is
seeking
to
recover
influence
by
leading
a
foreign
war
party
no
one
in
the
cabinet
is
strong
enough
to
combat
him
britain
lyons
thought
should
maintain
a
stiff
attitude
prepare
to
defend
canada
and
make
close
contacts
with
france
he
was
evidently
anxious
to
impress
upon
russell
that
seward
really
might
mean
war
but
he
declared
the
chief
danger
to
lie
in
the
fact
of
american
belief
that
england
and
france
could
not
be
driven
into
war
with
the
united
states
and
that
they
would
submit
to
any
insult
lyons
urged
some
action
or
declaration
he
did
not
know
what
to
correct
this
false
impression
again
on
the
next
day
may
the
information
in
his
official
despatch
was
repeated
in
a
private
letter
to
russell
but
lyons
here
interprets
seward
threats
as
mere
bluster
yet
he
is
not
absolutely
sure
of
this
and
in
any
case
insists
that
the
best
preventative
of
war
with
the
united
states
is
to
show
that
england
is
ready
for
it
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
the
british
minister
in
washington
may
he
warned
sir
edmund
head
governor
of
canada
urging
him
to
make
defensive
preparation
the
following
day
he
dilated
to
russell
privately
on
the
difficulty
of
keeping
seward
within
the
bounds
of
decency
even
in
ordinary
social
intercourse
and
in
an
official
communication
of
this
same
day
he
records
washington
rumours
of
a
belligerent
despatch
read
by
seward
before
the
cabinet
of
objections
by
other
members
and
that
seward
insistence
has
carried
the
day
that
seward
was
in
fact
still
smarting
over
his
reverse
is
shown
by
a
letter
written
on
this
same
may
to
his
intimate
friend
and
political
adviser
thurlow
weed
who
had
evidently
cautioned
him
against
precipitate
action
seward
wrote
the
european
phase
is
bad
but
your
apprehension
that
i
may
be
too
decisive
alarms
me
more
will
you
consent
or
advise
us
to
consent
that
adams
and
dayton
have
audiences
and
compliments
in
the
ministers
audience
chamber
and
confederate
secretary
of
state
emissaries
have
access
to
his
bedroom
two
interpretations
are
possible
from
this
either
that
seward
knowing
himself
defeated
was
bitter
in
retrospect
or
that
he
had
not
yet
yielded
his
will
to
that
of
lincoln
in
spite
of
the
changes
made
in
his
despatch
no
the
former
interpretation
seems
the
more
likely
for
though
seward
continued
to
write
for
a
time
vigorous
despatches
to
adams
they
none
of
them
approached
the
vigour
of
even
the
amended
despatch
moreover
the
exact
facts
of
the
cabinet
of
may
and
the
complete
reversal
of
seward
policy
were
sufficiently
known
by
may
to
have
reached
the
ears
of
schleiden
who
reported
them
in
a
letter
to
bremen
of
that
date
and
on
the
same
day
seward
himself
told
schleiden
that
he
did
not
fear
any
longer
that
it
would
come
to
a
break
with
england
on
may
lyons
himself
though
still
suspicious
that
an
attempt
was
being
made
to
separate
france
and
england
was
able
to
report
a
better
tone
from
seward
british
ministers
in
london
were
not
so
alarmed
as
was
lyons
but
they
were
disturbed
nevertheless
and
long
preserved
a
suspicion
of
the
american
secretary
of
state
may
palmerston
wrote
to
russell
in
comment
on
lyons
despatch
of
may
these
communications
are
very
unpleasant
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
either
from
foolish
and
uncalculating
arrogance
and
or
from
political
calculation
seward
may
bring
on
a
quarrel
with
us
he
believed
that
more
troops
ought
to
be
sent
to
canada
as
a
precautionary
measure
but
he
added
the
main
force
for
defence
must
of
course
be
local
a
situation
necessarily
a
cause
for
anxiety
by
british
ministers
russell
was
less
perturbed
he
had
previously
expressed
appreciation
of
adams
conduct
writing
to
lyons
adams
has
made
a
very
favourable
impression
on
my
mind
as
a
calm
and
judicious
man
and
he
now
wrote
i
do
not
think
seward
colleagues
will
encourage
him
in
a
game
of
brag
with
england
i
am
sorry
seward
turns
out
so
reckless
and
ruthless
adams
seems
a
sensible
man
but
at
washington
lyons
was
again
hot
on
the
trail
of
warlike
rumours
as
a
result
of
a
series
of
conversations
with
northern
politicians
not
cabinet
members
he
sent
a
cipher
telegram
to
russell
on
june
stating
no
new
event
has
occurred
but
sudden
declaration
of
war
by
the
united
states
against
great
britain
appears
to
me
by
no
means
impossible
especially
so
long
as
canada
seems
open
to
invasion
this
was
followed
two
days
later
by
a
despatch
dilating
upon
the
probability
of
war
and
ending
with
lyons
opinion
of
how
it
should
be
conducted
england
should
strike
at
once
with
the
largest
possible
naval
force
and
bring
the
war
to
an
end
before
the
united
states
could
prepare
otherwise
the
spirit
the
energy
and
the
resources
of
this
people
would
make
them
difficult
to
overcome
england
on
her
part
must
be
prepared
to
suffer
severely
from
american
privateers
and
she
would
be
forced
to
help
the
south
at
least
to
the
extent
of
keeping
southern
ports
open
finally
lyons
concluded
all
of
this
letter
and
advice
were
extremely
distasteful
to
him
yet
he
felt
compelled
to
write
it
by
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
nevertheless
he
would
exert
every
effort
and
use
every
method
to
conciliate
america
in
truth
it
was
not
any
further
belligerent
talk
by
seward
that
had
so
renewed
lyons
anxiety
rather
it
was
the
public
and
press
reception
of
the
news
of
the
queen
proclamation
of
neutrality
the
northern
people
counting
beyond
all
reasonable
expectation
upon
british
sympathy
on
grounds
had
been
angrily
disappointed
and
were
at
the
moment
loudly
voicing
their
vexation
had
seward
not
already
been
turned
from
his
foreign
war
policy
he
now
would
have
received
strong
public
support
in
it
but
he
made
no
effort
to
utilize
public
excitement
to
his
own
advantage
in
the
cabinet
in
england
adams
was
able
to
report
on
june
that
russell
had
no
intention
of
holding
further
interviews
with
the
southern
commissioners
but
before
anyone
in
washington
could
learn
of
this
there
was
general
knowledge
of
a
changed
tone
from
the
secretary
of
state
and
lyons
fears
were
considerably
allayed
on
june
occurred
that
interview
between
seward
lyons
and
mercier
in
which
seward
had
positively
refused
to
receive
the
queen
proclamation
but
had
throughout
evinced
the
greatest
courtesy
and
goodwill
lyons
so
reported
the
conversation
june
may
in
fact
be
taken
as
the
date
when
lyons
ceased
to
be
alarmed
over
an
immediate
war
possibly
he
found
it
a
little
difficult
to
report
so
sudden
a
shift
from
stormy
to
fair
weather
june
he
wrote
that
the
lull
was
still
continuing
june
he
at
last
learned
and
described
at
length
the
details
of
lincoln
alteration
of
despatch
no
he
did
not
know
the
exact
date
but
he
expressed
the
opinion
that
a
month
or
three
weeks
ago
war
was
very
near
a
misjudgment
since
it
should
be
remembered
that
war
seemed
advisable
to
one
man
only
seward
and
that
on
this
issue
he
had
been
definitely
cast
down
from
his
leadership
into
the
ranks
of
lincoln
lieutenants
lyons
was
then
nearly
a
month
behindhand
in
exact
knowledge
of
american
foreign
policy
toward
england
and
he
was
in
error
in
thinking
that
an
american
attack
on
england
was
either
imminent
or
intended
nevertheless
he
surely
was
excusable
considering
seward
prestige
and
lincoln
lack
of
it
in
reporting
as
he
did
it
was
long
indeed
before
he
could
escape
from
suspicion
of
seward
purposes
though
dropping
abruptly
further
comment
on
the
chances
of
war
a
month
later
on
july
he
wrote
that
seward
had
himself
asked
for
a
confidential
and
unofficial
interview
in
order
to
make
clear
that
there
never
had
been
any
intention
of
stirring
agitation
against
england
personally
seward
took
credit
for
avoiding
trouble
by
refusing
to
take
official
cognizance
of
the
recognition
by
england
of
the
belligerent
rights
of
the
south
and
he
asked
lyons
to
explain
to
russell
that
previous
strong
language
was
intended
merely
to
make
foreign
powers
understand
the
intensity
of
northern
feeling
lyons
put
no
faith
in
all
this
but
was
happy
to
note
the
change
mistakenly
attributing
it
to
england
stiff
tone
and
not
at
all
to
the
veto
of
the
president
since
lyons
himself
had
gone
to
the
utmost
bounds
in
seeking
conciliation
so
he
had
reported
and
in
london
russell
also
had
taken
no
forward
step
since
the
issue
of
the
proclamation
indeed
had
rather
yielded
somewhat
to
representations
it
is
not
clear
in
what
the
stiff
tone
consisted
indeed
the
cause
of
seward
explanation
to
lyons
was
the
receipt
of
a
despatch
from
adams
dated
june
in
which
the
latter
had
reported
that
all
was
now
smooth
sailing
he
had
told
russell
that
the
knowledge
in
washington
of
the
result
of
their
previous
interviews
had
brought
satisfaction
and
russell
for
his
part
said
that
lyons
had
learned
through
another
member
of
the
diplomatic
corps
that
no
further
expression
of
opinion
on
the
subject
in
question
would
be
necessary
this
referred
presumably
to
the
question
of
british
intention
for
the
future
in
relation
to
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
adams
wrote
this
led
to
the
most
frank
and
pleasant
conversation
which
i
have
yet
had
with
his
lordship
i
added
that
i
believed
the
popular
feeling
in
the
united
states
would
subside
the
moment
that
all
the
later
action
on
this
side
was
known
my
own
reception
has
been
all
that
i
could
desire
i
attach
value
to
this
however
only
as
it
indicates
the
establishment
of
a
policy
that
will
keep
us
at
peace
during
the
continuance
of
the
present
convulsion
in
reply
to
adams
despatch
seward
wrote
on
july
the
day
after
his
interview
with
lyons
arguing
at
great
length
the
american
view
that
the
british
proclamation
of
neutrality
in
a
domestic
quarrel
was
not
defensible
in
international
law
there
was
not
now
nor
later
any
yielding
on
this
point
but
for
the
present
this
was
intended
for
adams
eye
alone
and
seward
prefaced
his
argument
by
a
disclaimer
much
as
stated
to
lyons
of
any
to
great
britain
i
may
add
also
for
myself
that
however
otherwise
i
may
at
any
time
have
been
understood
it
has
been
an
earnest
and
profound
solicitude
to
avert
from
foreign
war
that
alone
has
prompted
the
emphatic
and
sometimes
perhaps
impassioned
remonstrances
i
have
hitherto
made
against
any
form
or
measure
of
recognition
of
the
insurgents
by
the
government
of
great
britain
i
write
in
the
same
spirit
now
and
i
invoke
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
as
i
propose
to
exercise
on
my
own
the
calmness
which
all
counsellors
ought
to
practise
in
debates
which
involve
the
peace
and
happiness
of
mankind
diplomatic
correspondence
couched
in
the
form
of
platform
oratory
leads
to
the
suspicion
that
the
writer
is
thinking
primarily
of
the
ultimate
publication
of
his
despatches
thus
seward
seems
to
have
been
laying
the
ground
for
a
denial
that
he
had
ever
developed
a
foolish
foreign
war
policy
history
pins
him
to
that
folly
but
in
another
respect
the
interview
with
lyons
on
july
and
the
letter
to
adams
of
the
day
following
overthrow
for
both
seward
and
for
the
united
states
the
accusations
sometimes
made
that
it
was
the
northern
disaster
at
bull
run
july
in
the
first
pitched
battle
with
the
south
which
made
more
temperate
the
northern
tone
toward
foreign
powers
it
is
true
that
the
despatch
to
adams
was
not
actually
sent
until
july
but
internal
evidence
shows
it
to
have
been
written
on
the
before
there
was
any
news
from
the
and
the
interview
with
lyons
on
the
proves
that
the
military
had
no
influence
on
friendly
expressions
moreover
these
expressions
officially
made
were
but
a
delayed
voicing
of
a
determination
of
policy
arrived
at
many
weeks
earlier
the
chronology
of
events
and
despatches
cited
in
this
chapter
will
have
shown
that
the
refusal
of
lincoln
to
follow
leadership
and
the
consequent
lessening
of
the
latter
high
tone
preceded
any
news
whatever
from
england
lightening
the
first
impressions
the
administration
at
washington
did
not
on
may
even
know
that
england
had
issued
a
proclamation
of
neutrality
it
knew
merely
of
russell
statement
that
one
would
have
to
be
issued
and
the
friendly
explanations
of
russell
to
adams
were
not
received
in
washington
until
the
month
following
in
itself
seward
foreign
war
panacea
policy
does
not
deserve
the
place
in
history
usually
accorded
it
as
a
moment
of
extreme
crisis
in
relations
there
was
never
any
danger
of
war
from
it
for
lincoln
nipped
the
policy
in
the
bud
the
public
excitement
in
america
over
the
queen
proclamation
was
indeed
intense
but
this
did
not
alter
the
governmental
attitude
in
england
all
that
the
public
knew
was
this
american
irritation
and
clamour
the
london
press
expressed
itself
a
bit
more
cautiously
for
the
moment
merely
defending
the
necessity
of
british
neutrality
but
if
regarded
from
the
effect
upon
british
ministers
the
incident
was
one
of
great
possibly
even
vital
importance
in
the
relations
of
the
two
countries
lyons
had
been
gravely
anxious
to
the
point
of
alarm
russell
less
acutely
alarmed
was
yet
seriously
disturbed
both
at
washington
and
in
london
the
suspicion
of
seward
lasted
throughout
the
earlier
years
of
the
war
and
to
british
ministers
it
seemed
that
at
any
moment
he
might
recover
leadership
and
revert
to
a
dangerous
mood
british
attitude
toward
america
was
affected
in
two
opposite
ways
britain
was
determined
not
to
be
bullied
and
russell
himself
sometimes
went
to
the
point
of
arrogance
in
answer
to
american
complaints
this
was
an
unfortunate
result
but
more
fortunate
and
a
was
the
british
determination
to
step
warily
in
the
american
conflict
and
to
give
no
just
cause
unless
on
due
consideration
of
policy
for
a
rupture
of
relations
with
the
united
states
seward

chapter
v
the
declaration

negotiation
if
regarded
merely
from
the
of
strict
chronology
there
accompanied
seward
foreign
war
policy
a
negotiation
with
great
britain
which
was
of
importance
as
the
first
effort
of
the
american
secretary
of
state
to
bring
european
nations
to
a
definite
support
of
the
northern
cause
it
was
also
the
first
negotiation
undertaken
by
adams
in
london
and
as
a
man
new
to
the
diplomatic
service
he
attached
to
it
an
unusual
importance
even
seemingly
to
the
extent
of
permitting
personal
chagrin
at
the
ultimate
failure
of
the
negotiation
to
distort
his
usually
cool
and
fair
judgment
the
matter
in
question
was
the
offer
of
the
united
states
to
accede
by
a
convention
to
the
declaration
of
paris
of
establishing
certain
international
rules
for
the
conduct
of
maritime
warfare
this
negotiation
has
received
scant
attention
in
history
it
failed
to
result
in
a
treaty
therefore
it
has
appeared
to
be
negligible
yet
it
was
at
the
time
of
very
great
importance
in
affecting
the
attitude
toward
each
other
of
great
britain
and
the
united
states
and
of
the
men
who
spoke
for
their
respective
countries
the
bald
facts
of
the
negotiation
appear
with
exactness
in
moore
of
international
but
without
comment
as
to
motives
and
more
briefly
in
bernard
of
great
britain
during
the
american
civil
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
author
writes
with
sarcasm
i
refrain
from
any
comment
on
this
negotiation
nicolay
and
and
rhodes
give
the
matter
but
passing
and
inadequate
treatment
it
was
reviewed
in
some
detail
in
the
american
argument
before
the
geneva
court
of
arbitration
in
the
case
of
the
but
was
there
presented
merely
as
a
part
of
the
general
american
complaint
of
british
neutrality
in
fact
but
three
historical
students
so
far
as
the
present
writer
has
been
able
to
discover
have
examined
this
negotiation
in
detail
and
presented
their
conclusions
as
to
purposes
and
motives
so
important
to
an
understanding
of
british
intentions
at
the
moment
when
the
flames
of
civil
war
were
rapidly
spreading
in
america
these
three
each
with
an
established
historical
reputation
exhibit
decided
differences
in
interpretation
of
diplomatic
incidents
and
documents
the
first
careful
analysis
was
presented
by
henry
adams
son
of
the
american
minister
in
london
during
the
civil
war
and
then
acting
as
his
private
secretary
in
his
published
in
the
second
study
is
by
bancroft
in
his
of
while
the
third
is
by
charles
francis
adams
also
son
of
the
american
minister
who
in
his
of
his
father
published
gave
a
chapter
to
the
subject
and
treated
it
on
lines
similar
to
those
laid
down
by
his
brother
henry
but
who
in
came
to
the
conclusion
through
further
study
that
he
had
earlier
been
in
error
and
developed
a
very
different
view
in
a
monograph
entitled
seward
and
the
declaration
of
paris

these
historiographic
details
seem
unduly
minute
partaking
as
they
do
of
the
nature
of
a
in
a
work
otherwise
general
in
treatment
the
author
answer
is
that
the
personality
of
two
of
the
writers
mentioned
and
their
intimate
knowledge
of
the
effect
of
the
negotiation
upon
the
mind
of
the
american
minister
in
london
are
themselves
important
historical
data
a
further
answer
is
the
fact
that
the
materials
now
available
from
the
british
foreign
office
archives
throw
much
new
light
both
on
the
course
of
the
negotiation
and
on
british
purposes
it
is
here
planned
therefore
first
to
review
the
main
facts
as
previously
known
second
to
summarize
the
arguments
and
conclusions
of
the
three
historians
third
to
the
negotiation
in
the
light
of
the
new
material
and
finally
to
express
an
opinion
on
its
conduct
and
conclusions
as
an
evidence
of
british
policy
in
during
the
crimean
war
great
britain
and
france
the
chief
maritime
belligerents
engaged
against
russia
voluntarily
agreed
to
respect
neutral
commerce
under
either
the
neutral
or
the
enemy
flag
this
was
a
distinct
step
forward
in
the
practice
of
maritime
warfare
the
accepted
international
rules
of
which
had
not
been
formally
altered
since
the
napoleonic
period
the
action
of
great
britain
was
due
in
part
according
to
a
later
statement
in
parliament
by
palmerston
march
to
a
fear
that
unless
a
greater
respect
were
paid
than
formerly
to
neutral
rights
the
allies
would
quickly
win
the
of
the
united
states
then
the
most
powerful
maritime
neutral
and
would
run
the
danger
of
forcing
that
country
into
belligerent
alliance
with
russia
no
doubt
there
were
other
reasons
also
for
the
barbarous
rules
and
practices
of
maritime
warfare
in
earlier
times
were
by
now
regarded
as
by
the
writers
of
all
nations
certainly
the
action
of
the
belligerents
in
met
with
general
approval
and
in
the
result
was
written
into
international
law
at
the
congress
of
paris
in
where
at
the
conclusion
of
the
war
the
belligerents
and
some
leading
neutrals
were
gathered

that
is
to
say
maintained
by

sufficient
really
to
prevent

to
the

of
the

this
agreement
was
adopted
by
austria
france
great
britain
prussia
russia
sardinia
and
turkey
and
it
was
further
agreed
that
a
general
invitation
to

extended
to
all
nations
but
with
the
proviso
that
the

which
shall

shall

thereto
shall
not
in
future
enter

concerning
the

of

which
does
not
rest
altogether
upon
the
four
principles
embodied
in
the

declaration
in
other
words

must
be
accepted
in
whole
and
not
in

and

powers

themselves
not
to
enter
into
any
subsequent
treaties
or
engagements
on
maritime
law
which
did
not
stipulate
observance
of
all
four
points
within
a
short
time
nearly
all
the
maritime
nations
of
the
world
had
given
official
adherence
to
the
declaration
of
paris
but
the
united
states
refused
to
do
so
she
had
long
stood
in
the
advance
guard
of
nations
demanding
respect
for
neutral
rights
little
by
little
her
avowed
principles
of
international
law
as
regards
neutrals
first
scoffed
at
had
crept
into
acceptance
in
treaty
stipulations
secretary
of
state
marcy
now
declared
in
july
that
the
united
states
would
accede
to
the
declaration
if
a
fifth
article
were
added
to
it
protecting
all
private
property
at
sea
when
not
contraband
this
covered
not
only
cargo
but
the
vessel
as
well
and
its
effect
would
have
been
to
exclude
from
belligerent
operations
goods
under
the
enemy
flag
if
goods
and
ship
were
privately
owned
maritime
warfare
on
the
high
seas
would
have
been
limited
to
battles
between
governmentally
operated
unless
this
rule
were
adopted
also
secretary
marcy
declared
that
the
united
states
could
not
forgo
the
right
to
send
out
privateers
which
in
the
past
had
proved
her
most
effective
maritime
weapon
in
time
of
war
and
which
since
she
had
no
large
navy
were
essential
to
her
fighting
power
war
on
private
property
said
the
americans
had
been
abolished
on
land
why
should
it
not
be
abolished
also
on
the
sea
the
american
proposal
met
with
general
support
among
the
smaller
maritime
nations
it
was
believed
that
the
one
great
obstacle
to
the
adoption
of
amendment
lay
in
the
naval
supremacy
of
great
britain
and
that
obstacle
proved
insurmountable
thus
the
united
states
refused
to
accede
to
the
declaration
and
there
the
matter
rested
until
but
on
april
jefferson
davis
proclaimed
for
the
southern
confederacy
the
issue
of
privateers
against
northern
commerce
on
april
seward
instructed
representatives
abroad
recounting
the
marcy
proposal
and
expressing
the
hope
that
it
still
might
meet
with
a
favourable
reception
but
authorizing
them
to
enter
into
conventions
for
american
adherence
to
the
declaration
of
on
the
four
points
alone
this
instruction
was
sent
to
the
ministers
in
great
britain
france
russia
prussia
austria
belgium
italy
and
denmark
and
on
may
to
the
netherlands
having
received
this
instruction
adams
at
the
close
of
his
first
meeting
with
russell
on
may
after
having
developed
at
length
the
american
position
relative
to
the
issue
of
the
british
proclamation
of
neutrality
briefly
added
that
he
was
directed
to
offer
adherence
by
means
of
a
convention
to
the
declaration
of
paris
russell
replied
that
great
britain
was
willing
to
negotiate
but
seemed
to
desire
to
leave
the
subject
in
the
hands
of
lord
lyons
to
whom
he
intimated
that
he
had
already
transmitted
authority
adams
therefore
did
not
press
the
matter
waiting
further
information
and
instruction
from
washington
nearly
two
weeks
earlier
russell
had
in
fact
approached
the
government
of
france
with
a
suggestion
that
the
two
leading
maritime
powers
should
propose
to
the
american
belligerents
adherence
to
the
second
and
third
articles
of
the
declaration
of
paris
france
had
agreed
and
the
date
of
russell
instruction
to
lyons
was
may
the
day
of
the
interview
with
adams
confusion
now
arose
in
both
london
and
washington
as
to
the
place
where
the
arrangement
was
to
be
concluded
the
causes
of
this
confusion
will
be
considered
later
in
this
chapter
here
it
is
sufficient
to
note
that
the
negotiation
was
finally
undertaken
at
london
on
july
russell
informed
adams
that
great
britain
was
ready
to
enter
into
a
convention
with
the
united
states
provided
a
similar
convention
was
signed
with
france
at
the
same
time
this
convention
as
submitted
by
adams
simply
recorded
an
agreement
by
the
two
powers
to
abide
by
the
four
points
of
the
declaration
of
paris
using
the
exact
wording
of
that
document
adams
draft
had
been
communicated
to
russell
on
july
there
then
followed
a
delay
required
by
the
necessity
of
securing
similar
action
by
dayton
the
american
minister
at
paris
but
on
july
adams
reported
to
russell
that
this
had
been
done
and
that
he
was
ready
to
sign
two
days
later
july
russell
replied
that
he
also
was
ready
but
concluded
his
letter
i
need
scarcely
add
that
on
the
part
of
great
britain
the
engagement
will
be
prospective
and
will
not
invalidate
anything
already
done
it
was
not
until
august
however
that
cowley
the
british
ambassador
to
france
reported
that
dayton
had
informed
thouvenel
french
foreign
minister
that
he
was
ready
to
sign
the
similar
convention
with
france
with
no
understanding
apparently
of
the
causes
of
further
delay
and
professing
complete
ignorance
of
the
meaning
of
russell
phrase
just
quoted
adams
waited
the
expected
invitation
to
an
official
interview
for
the
affixing
of
signatures
since
it
was
a
condition
of
the
negotiation
that
this
should
be
done
simultaneously
in
london
and
paris
the
further
delay
that
now
occurred
caused
him
no
misgivings
on
august
russell
requested
adams
to
name
a
convenient
day
in
the
course
of
this
week
and
prefaced
this
request
with
the
statement
that
he
enclosed
a
copy
of
a
declaration
which
he
proposed
to
make
in
writing
upon
signing
the
convention
you
will
observe
he
wrote
that
it
is
intended
to
prevent
any
misconception
as
to
the
nature
of
the
engagement
to
be
taken
by
her
majesty
the
proposed
declaration
read
in
affixing
his
signature
to
the
convention
of
this
day
between
her
majesty
the
queen
of
great
britain
and
ireland
and
the
united
states
of
america
the
earl
russell
declares
by
order
of
her
majesty
that
her
majesty
does
not
intend
thereby
to
undertake
any
engagement
which
shall
have
any
bearing
direct
or
indirect
on
the
internal
differences
now
prevailing
in
the
united
states
under
his
instructions
to
negotiate
a
convention
for
a
pure
and
simple
adherence
to
the
declaration
of
paris
adams
could
not
now
go
on
to
official
signature
nor
was
he
inclined
to
do
so
sincerely
believing
as
he
stated
to
russell
in
a
communication
of
august
that
the
united
states
was
acting
with
the
single
purpose
of
aiding
to
establish
a
permanent
doctrine
for
all
time
and
with
the
object
of
ameliorating
the
horrors
of
warfare
all
over
the
globe
he
objected
to
accompany
the
act
with
a
proceeding
somewhat
novel
and
anomalous
which
on
the
face
of
it
seemed
to
imply
a
suspicion
on
the
part
of
great
britain
that
the
united
states
was
desirous
at
this
time
to
take
a
part
in
the
declaration
of
paris
not
from
any
high
purpose
or
durable
policy
but
with
the
view
of
securing
some
small
temporary
object
in
the
unhappy
struggle
which
is
going
on
at
home
he
also
pointed
out
that
russell
proposed
declaration
either
was
or
was
not
a
part
of
the
convention
if
it
was
a
part
then
the
senate
of
the
united
states
must
ratify
it
as
well
as
the
convention
itself
and
he
would
have
gone
beyond
his
instructions
in
submitting
it
if
not
a
part
of
the
convention
there
could
be
no
advantage
in
making
the
declaration
since
unratified
by
the
senate
it
would
have
no
force
adams
therefore
declined
to
proceed
further
with
the
matter
until
he
had
received
new
instructions
from
washington
to
this
russell
answered
august
with
a
very
explicit
exposition
of
his
reasons
great
britain
he
said
had
declared
her
neutrality
in
the
american
conflict
thereby
recognizing
the
belligerent
rights
of
the
south
it
followed
that
the
south
might
by
the
law
of
nations
arm
privateers
and
that
these
must
be
regarded
as
the
armed
vessels
of
a
belligerent
but
the
united
states
had
refused
to
recognize
the
status
of
belligerency
and
could
therefore
maintain
that
privateers
issued
by
the
southern
states
were
in
fact
pirates
and
might
argue
that
a
european
power
signing
a
convention
with
the
united
states
embodying
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
paris
would
be
bound
to
treat
the
privateers
of
the
confederate
states
as
pirates
hence
russell
pointed
out
the
two
countries
arguing
from
contradictory
premises
as
to
the
status
of
the
conflict
in
america
might
become
involved
in
charges
of
bad
faith
and
of
violation
of
the
convention
he
had
therefore
merely
intended
by
his
suggested
declaration
to
prevent
any
misconception
by
the
united
states
it
is
in
this
spirit
that
her
majesty
government
decline
to
bind
themselves
without
a
clear
explanation
on
their
part
to
a
convention
which
seemingly
confined
to
an
adoption
of
the
declaration
of
paris
of
might
be
construed
as
an
engagement
to
interfere
in
the
unhappy
dissensions
now
prevailing
in
the
united
states
an
interference
which
would
be
contrary
to
her
majesty
public
declarations
and
would
be
a
reversal
of
the
policy
which
her
majesty
has
deliberately
sanctioned
thus
the
negotiation
closed
seward
in
declining
to
accept
the
proposed
declaration
gave
varying
reasons
in
his
instructions
to
adams
in
london
and
to
dayton
in
paris
for
an
exactly
similar
declaration
had
been
insisted
upon
by
france
but
he
did
not
argue
the
question
save
in
generalities
he
told
dayton
that
the
supposed
possible
intervention
which
great
britain
and
france
seemed
to
fear
they
would
be
called
upon
to
make
was
exactly
the
action
which
the
united
states
desired
to
forestall
and
he
notified
adams
that
he
could
not
consent
since
the
proposed
declaration
would
be
virtually
a
new
and
distinct
article
incorporated
into
the
projected
convention
the
first
formal
negotiation
of
the
united
states
during
the
civil
war
and
of
the
new
american
minister
in
london
had
come
to
an
inglorious
conclusion
diplomats
and
foreign
secretaries
were
quite
naturally
disturbed
and
were
even
suspicious
of
each
others
motives
but
the
public
not
at
the
moment
informed
save
on
the
american
offer
and
the
result
paid
little
attention
to
these
inner
circle
controversies
what
then
were
the
hidden
purposes
if
such
existed
of
the
negotiating
powers
the
first
answer
in
historical
writing
was
that
offered
by
henry
adams
in
an
essay
entitled
the
declaration
of
paris
in
the
preparation
of
which
the
author
studied
with
care
all
the
diplomatic
correspondence
available
in
print
his
treatment
presents
russell
as
engaged
in
a
policy
of
deception
with
the
view
of
obtaining
an
ultimate
advantage
to
great
britain
in
the
field
of
commercial
rivalry
and
maritime
supremacy
following
henry
adams
argument
russell
on
may
brought
to
the
attention
of
france
a
proposal
for
a
joint
request
on
the
american
belligerents
to
respect
the
second
and
third
articles
of
the
declaration
of
paris
and
received
an
acquiescent
reply
after
some
further
exchanges
of
proposed
terms
of
instructions
to
the
british
and
french
ministers
at
washington
russell
on
may
sent
a
despatch
to
lyons
with
instructions
for
his
action
on
this
same
day
russell
in
his
first
interview
with
adams
before
these
despatches
to
lyons
could
have
left
the
foreign
office
and
replying
to
adams
proposal
to
negotiate
on
the
declaration
of
paris
as
a
that
is
to
say
on
all
four
articles
intimated
that
instructions
had
already
gone
to
lyons
with
directions
to
assent
to
any
modification
of
the
article
on
privateering
that
the
united
states
might
desire
adams
understood
russell
to
prefer
that
the
negotiation
for
such
adams
thought
it
was
to
be
should
take
place
in
washington
and
did
not
press
the
matter
this
was
deliberate
deceit
first
in
a
statement
of
fact
since
the
interview
with
adams
took
place
at
noon
on
may
at
russell
country
house
nine
miles
from
london
and
in
all
reasonable
supposition
the
despatch
to
lyons
would
not
have
been
sent
until
the
foreign
return
to
his
office
second
because
lyons
was
not
instructed
to
on
the
declaration
the
interpretation
is
justified
therefore
that
russell
evaded
the
offer
of
the
united
states
government
the
result
of
this
evasion
was
delay
but
when
seward
learned
from
lyons
that
he
had
no
authority
to
negotiate
a
convention
and
adams
received
renewed
instructions
to
proceed
the
latter
kept
his
temper
but
the
affair
made
a
lasting
impression
on
his
mind
and
shook
his
faith
in
the
straightforwardness
of
the
british
government
in
renewing
his
overtures
at
london
adams
made
explanations
of
the
previous
misunderstanding
and
to
these
russell
replied
with
further
inaccuracies
as
to
what
had
been
said
at
the
first
interview
thus
beginning
his
survey
with
an
assertion
of
british
deceit
and
evasion
from
the
very
outset
and
incidentally
remarking
that
lyons
at
washington
made
little
disguise
of
his
leanings
toward
the
south
henry
adams
depicts
russell
as
leading
france
along
a
line
of
policy
distinctly
unfriendly
to
the
north
examining
each
point
in
the
negotiation
as
already
narrated
he
summarized
it
as
follows
the
story
has
shown
that
russell
and
his
colleagues
induced
the
french
government
to
violate
the
pledge
in
the
protocol
of
the
declaration
of
paris
in
order
to
offer
to
both
belligerents
a
partial
adhesion
which
must
exclude
the
united
states
from
a
simple
adhesion
to
the
declaration
of
paris
while
it
placed
both
belligerents
on
the
same
apparent
footing
these
steps
were
taken
in
haste
before
adams
could
obtain
an
interview
when
adams
by
an
effort
unexpected
to
russell
obtained
an
interview
at
pembroke
lodge
at
noon
of
saturday
may
and
according
to
russell
report
of
may
said
that
the
united
states
were
to
adhere
to
the
declaration
of
paris
russell
evaded
the
offer
saying
that
he
had
already
sent
sufficient
instructions
to
lyons
although
the
instructions
were
not
sufficient
nor
had
they
been
sent
when
this
evasion
was
afterward
brought
to
his
notice
by
adams
russell
revising
his
report
to
lyons
made
such
changes
in
it
as
should
represent
the
first
proposal
as
coming
from
himself
and
the
evasion
to
have
come
from
adams
when
at
last
obliged
to
read
the
american
offer
russell
declared
that
he
had
never
heard
of
it
before
although
he
had
himself
reported
it
to
lyons
and
lyons
had
reported
it
to
him
when
compelled
to
take
the
offer
for
consideration
russell
though
always
professing
to
welcome
adhesion
pure
and
simple
required
the
of
dayton
when
adams
overcame
this
last
obstacle
russell
interposed
a
written
proviso
which
as
he
knew
from
lyons
would
prevent
ratification
when
adams
paid
no
attention
to
the
proviso
but
insisted
on
signature
of
the
treaty
russell
at
last
wrote
a
declaration
in
the
nature
of
an
insult
which
could
not
be
disregarded
in
this
presentation
of
the
case
to
the
jury
certain
minor
points
are
insisted
upon
to
establish
a
ground
for
suspicion
as
the
question
of
who
first
made
the
proposal
that
are
not
essential
to
henry
conclusions
this
conclusion
is
that
from
the
delays
interposed
by
russell
adams
must
conclude
that
the
british
cabinet
was
trying
one
device
after
another
to
evade
the
proposition
and
finally
from
the
written
declaration
of
august
he
could
draw
no
other
inference
than
that
russell
had
resorted
to
the
only
defensive
weapon
left
to
him
in
order
to
avoid
the
avowal
of
his
true
motives
and
policy
the
of
this
tortuous
proceeding
the
author
believed
to
have
been
a
scheme
to
revive
the
american
war
was
ended
the
earlier
international
practice
of
great
britain
in
treating
as
subject
to
belligerent
seizure
enemy
goods
under
the
neutral
flag
it
was
the
american
stand
argues
henry
adams
that
in
had
compelled
great
britain
to
renounce
this
practice
a
complete
american
adherence
now
to
the
declaration
would
for
ever
tie
britain
hands
but
if
there
were
no
such
complete
adherence
and
only
temporary
observation
of
the
second
article
after
the
war
had
resulted
in
the
disruption
of
the
united
states
thus
removing
the
chief
supporter
of
that
article
great
britain
would
feel
free
to
resume
her
practice
when
she
engaged
in
war
if
great
britain
made
a
formal
treaty
with
the
united
states
she
would
feel
bound
to
respect
it
the
declaration
of
paris
as
it
stood
constituted
a
mere
agreement
which
was
binding
as
lord
malmesbury
declared
only
so
long
as
it
was
convenient
to
respect
it
thus
the
second
article
of
the
declaration
of
paris
not
the
first
on
privateering
was
in
the
eye
of
the
british
cabinet
in
the
negotiation
of
henry
adams
ends
his
essay
after
the
manner
in
which
russell
received
the
advances
of
president
lincoln
no
american
minister
in
london
could
safely
act
on
any
other
assumption
than
that
the
british
government
meant
at
the
first
convenient
opportunity
to
revive
the
belligerent
pretensions
dormant
since
the
war
of
this
analysis
was
published
in
still
more
briefly
summarized
it
depicts
an
unfriendly
almost
hostile
attitude
on
the
part
of
russell
and
lyons
deceit
and
evasion
by
the
former
selfish
british
policy
and
throughout
a
blind
following
on
by
france
yielding
to
leadership
the
american
proposal
is
regarded
merely
as
a
simple
and
sincere
offer
to
join
in
supporting
an
improved
international
practice
in
but
when
frederic
bancroft
the
biographer
of
seward
examined
the
negotiation
he
was
compelled
to
ask
himself
whether
this
was
all
indeed
that
the
american
secretary
of
state
had
in
view
bancroft
analysis
may
be
stated
more
briefly
seward
general
instruction
bancroft
notes
bore
date
of
april
nearly
a
month
before
any
foreign
power
had
recognized
southern
belligerent
rights
it
indicates
a
plan
by
which
he
hoped
to
remove
all
excuse
for
such
action
in
despatches
to
dayton
seward
asserted
a
twofold
motive
a
sincere
desire
to
with
other
progressive
nations
in
the
melioration
of
the
rigours
of
maritime
war
and
to
remove
every
cause
that
any
foreign
power
could
have
for
the
recognition
of
the
insurgents
as
a
belligerent
power
this
last
result
was
not
so
clear
to
dayton
at
paris
nor
was
the
mechanism
of
operation
ever
openly
stated
by
seward
but
he
did
write
later
that
the
proposal
of
accession
to
the
declaration
of
paris
was
tendered
as
the
act
of
this
federal
government
to
be
obligatory
equally
upon
disloyal
as
upon
loyal
citizens
it
did
not
writes
bancroft
require
the
gift
of
prophecy
to
tell
what
would
result
in
case
the
offer
of
accession
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
should
be
accepted
seward
object
was
to
place
the
european
nations
in
a
position
where
they
as
well
as
the
united
states
would
be
forced
to
regard
southern
privateers
as
pirates
and
treat
them
as
such
this
was
a
conceivable
result
of
the
negotiation
before
european
recognition
of
southern
belligerency
but
even
after
that
recognition
and
after
dayton
had
pointed
out
the
impossibility
of
such
a
result
seward
pressed
for
the
treaty
and
instructed
dayton
not
to
raise
the
question
with
france
he
still
had
in
mind
this
main
object
if
seward
says
bancroft
had
not
intended
to
use
the
adherence
of
the
united
states
to
the
declaration
as
a
lever
to
force
the
other
powers
to
treat
the
confederates
as
pirates
or
at
least
to
cease
regarding
them
as
belligerents
he
might
easily
and
unofficially
have
removed
all
such
suspicions
in
an
interview
with
lyons
on
july
seward
urged
a
quick
conclusion
of
the
treaty
arguing
that
its
effect
upon
the
revolted
states
could
be
determined
afterwards
naturally
lyons
was
alarmed
and
gave
warning
to
russell
probably
it
was
this
advice
that
caused
russell
to
insist
on
the
explanatory
declaration
it
would
appear
then
that
seward
much
underestimated
the
acuteness
of
russell
and
thouvenel
and
expected
them
to
walk
into
a
trap
nor
could
his
claim
that
there
was
no
difference
between
a
nation
entirely
at
peace
and
one
in
circumstances
like
those
of
the
united
states
at
this
time
be
taken
seriously
he
was
furnishing
his
opponent
with
evidences
of
his
lack
of
candour
this
clouded
the
effect
that
would
have
followed
a
wise
and
generous
policy
toward
neutrals
which
had
doubtless
been
in
seward
mind
from
the
beginning
in
the
end
he
concluded
the
negotiation
gracefully
writing
to
adams
a
pledge
of
american
respect
for
the
second
and
third
articles
of
the
declaration
of
paris
exactly
that
which
lyons
had
originally
been
instructed
by
russell
to
secure
we
regard
great
britain
as
a
friend
her
majesty
flag
according
to
our
traditional
principles
covers
enemy
goods
not
contraband
of
war
goods
of
her
majesty
subjects
not
contraband
of
war
are
exempt
from
confiscation
though
found
under
a
neutral
or
disloyal
flag
no
depredations
shall
be
committed
by
our
naval
forces
or
by
those
of
any
of
our
citizens
so
far
as
we
can
prevent
it
upon
the
vessels
or
property
of
british
subjects
our
blockade
being
effective
must
be
respected
thus
bancroft
regards
seward
proposals
of
april
as
in
part
the
result
of
humanitarian
motives
and
in
part
as
having
a
concealed
purpose
of
northern
advantage
this
last
he
calls
a
trap
and
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
seward
final
pledge
to
adams
the
phrase
those
of
any
of
our
citizens
reserves
for
the
north
since
the
negotiation
had
failed
the
right
to
issue
privateers
on
her
own
account
but
russell
also
says
bancroft
was
not
altogether
artless
and
frank
he
had
in
view
a
british
commercial
advantage
during
the
war
since
if
the
united
states
respected
the
second
and
third
articles
of
the
declaration
of
paris
and
if
confederate
privateers
should
roam
the
ocean
and
seize
the
ships
and
goods
of
citizens
of
the
north
all
the
better
for
other
commercial
nations
for
it
would
soon
cause
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
to
be
carried
on
under
foreign
flags
especially
the
british
and
french
ulterior
motive
is
therefore
ascribed
to
both
parties
in
the
negotiation
and
that
of
seward
is
treated
as
conceived
at
the
moment
when
a
policy
of
seeking
european
friendship
was
dominant
at
washington
but
with
the
hope
of
securing
at
least
negative
european
support
seward
persistence
after
european
recognition
of
southern
belligerency
is
regarded
as
a
characteristic
obstinacy
without
a
clear
view
of
possible
resulting
dangerous
complications
this
view
discredits
the
acumen
of
the
american
secretary
of
state
and
it
does
not
completely
satisfy
the
third
historian
to
examine
the
incident
in
detail
nor
does
he
agree
on
the
basis
of
british
policy
charles
francis
adams
in
his
life
of
his
father
writing
in
followed
in
the
main
the
view
of
his
brother
henry
adams
but
in
he
reviewed
the
negotiation
at
great
length
with
different
conclusions
his
thesis
is
that
the
declaration
of
paris
negotiation
was
an
essential
part
of
seward
foreign
war
policy
in
that
in
case
a
treaty
was
signed
with
great
britain
and
france
and
then
those
powers
refused
to
aid
in
the
suppression
of
southern
privateering
or
at
least
permitted
them
access
to
british
and
french
ports
a
good
ground
of
complaint
leading
to
war
would
be
established
was
the
ultimate
ulterior
purpose
in
seward
mind
the
negotiation
was
but
a
method
of
fixing
a
quarrel
on
some
foreign
power
in
case
the
united
states
should
seek
as
seward
desired
a
cementing
of
the
rift
at
home
by
a
foreign
war
in
the
details
of
the
negotiation
adams
agrees
with
bancroft
but
with
this
new
interpretation
the
opening
misunderstanding
he
ascribed
as
did
lyons
to
the
simple
fact
that
seward
had
refused
to
see
the
despatch
in
which
russell
proposals
were
made
instructions
of
july
after
the
misunderstanding
was
made
clear
to
him
pushing
the
negotiation
were
drawn
when
he
was
still
riding
a
very
high
horse
the
no
charger
in
fact
he
had
mounted
on
the
of
the
previous
may
and
this
warlike
charger
he
continued
to
ride
until
the
sobering
northern
defeat
at
bull
run
july
put
an
end
to
his
folly
if
that
battle
had
been
a
northern
victory
he
would
have
gone
on
with
his
project
now
with
the
end
of
a
period
of
and
the
emergence
of
sanity
in
foreign
policy
secretary
seward
in
due
time
september
pronounced
the
proposed
reservation
by
russell
quite
and
here
the
curtain
fell
on
this
somewhat
prolonged
and
not
altogether
creditable
diplomatic
farce
incidentally
adams
examined
also
british
action
and
intention
lyons
is
wholly
exonerated
of
him
it
may
be
fairly
said
that
his
course
throughout
seems
to
furnish
no
ground
for
criticism
and
lyons
is
quoted
as
having
understood
in
the
end
the
real
purpose
of
seward
policy
in
seeking
embroilment
with
europe
he
wrote
to
russell
on
december
upon
the
american
publication
of
despatches
accompanying
the
president
annual
message
little
doubt
can
remain
after
reading
the
papers
that
the
accession
was
offered
solely
with
the
view
to
the
effect
it
would
have
on
the
privateering
operations
of
the
southern
states
and
that
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
england
and
france
after
having
accepted
the
accession
to
treat
the
southern
privateers
as
pirates
would
have
been
made
a
serious
grievance
if
not
a
ground
of
quarrel
as
to
russell
combating
henry
adams
view
it
is
asserted
that
it
was
the
great
good
fortune
of
the
united
states
that
the
british
foreign
secretary
having
declared
a
policy
of
neutrality
was
not
to
be
driven
from
its
honest
application
by
irritations
nor
seduced
into
a
position
where
the
continuation
of
that
policy
would
be
difficult
before
entering
upon
an
account
of
the
bearing
of
the
newly
available
british
materials
on
the
negotiation
materials
which
will
in
themselves
offer
sufficient
comment
on
the
theories
of
henry
adams
and
in
less
degree
of
bancroft
it
is
best
to
note
here
the
fallacy
in
main
thesis
if
the
analysis
given
in
the
preceding
chapter
of
the
initiation
and
duration
of
seward
foreign
war
policy
is
correct
then
the
declaration
of
paris
negotiation
had
no
essential
relation
whatever
to
that
policy
the
instructions
to
adams
were
sent
to
eight
other
ministers
is
it
conceivable
that
seward
desired
a
war
with
the
whole
maritime
world
the
date
april
antedates
any
deliberate
proposal
of
a
foreign
war
whatever
he
may
have
been
brooding
and
in
fact
stamps
the
offer
as
part
of
that
friendly
policy
toward
europe
which
lincoln
had
insisted
upon
seward
frenzy
for
a
foreign
war
did
not
come
to
a
head
until
the
news
had
been
received
of
determination
to
recognize
southern
belligerency
this
was
in
the
second
week
of
may
and
on
the
despatch
no
marked
the
decline
not
the
beginning
of
a
belligerent
policy
and
by
the
orders
by
may
probably
by
the
certainly
seward
had
yielded
and
was
rapidly
beginning
to
turn
to
expressions
of
friendship
yet
it
was
only
on
may
that
russell
first
instructions
to
lyons
were
sent
and
not
until
late
in
june
that
the
misunderstanding
cleared
away
instructions
were
despatched
by
seward
to
push
the
declaration
of
paris
negotiations
at
london
and
paris
the
battle
of
bull
run
had
nothing
to
do
with
a
new
policy
thus
chronology
forbids
the
inclusion
of
this
negotiation
either
in
its
inception
progress
or
conclusion
as
an
agency
intended
to
make
possible
on
just
grounds
a
foreign
war
a
mere
chronological
examination
of
documents
both
printed
and
in
archives
permits
a
clearer
view
of
british
policy
on
the
declaration
of
paris
recalling
the
facts
of
the
american
situation
known
in
london
it
will
be
remembered
that
on
may
the
british
government
and
parliament
became
aware
that
a
civil
war
was
inevitable
and
that
the
south
planned
to
issue
privateers
on
that
day
russell
asked
the
admiralty
to
reinforce
the
british
fleet
in
west
indian
waters
that
british
commerce
might
be
adequately
protected
five
days
later
may
he
announced
in
the
commons
that
great
britain
must
be
strictly
neutral
and
that
a
policy
of
close
harmony
with
france
was
being
matured
and
on
this
day
he
proposed
through
cowley
in
paris
that
great
britain
and
france
each
ask
the
contending
parties
in
america
to
abide
by
the
second
and
third
articles
of
the
declaration
of
paris
if
there
was
ulterior
motive
here
it
does
not
appear
in
any
despatch
either
then
or
later
passing
between
any
of
the
british
diplomats
concerned
russell
cowley
and
lyons
the
plain
fact
was
that
the
united
states
was
not
an
adherent
to
the
declaration
that
the
south
had
announced
privateering
and
the
north
a
blockade
and
that
the
only
portions
of
the
declaration
in
regard
to
which
the
belligerents
had
as
yet
made
no
statement
were
the
second
and
third
articles
it
was
indeed
an
anxious
time
for
the
british
government
on
may
forster
asked
in
the
commons
what
would
be
the
government
attitude
toward
a
british
subject
serving
on
a
southern
privateer
the
next
day
in
the
lords
there
occurred
a
debate
the
general
burden
of
which
was
that
privateering
was
in
fact
piracy
but
that
under
the
conditions
of
the
american
previous
stand
it
could
not
be
treated
as
such
both
in
the
commons
and
the
lords
speakers
were
referred
to
the
forthcoming
proclamation
of
neutrality
but
the
uncertainty
developed
in
both
debates
is
very
probably
reflected
in
the
new
despatch
now
sent
to
cowley
on
may
by
that
despatch
france
was
asked
to
send
an
instruction
to
mercier
in
washington
similar
to
a
draft
instruction
intended
for
lyons
a
copy
of
which
was
enclosed
to
cowley
the
object
being
to
secure
from
the
american
belligerents
adherence
to
the
articles
privateering
included
of
the
declaration
of
paris
whatever
russell
purpose
in
thus
altering
his
original
suggestion
it
met
with
a
prompt
check
from
france
on
may
thouvenel
had
agreed
heartily
to
the
proposal
of
may
adding
the
practical
advice
that
the
best
method
of
approach
to
the
confederacy
would
be
through
the
consuls
in
the
south
now
on
may
russell
was
informed
that
thouvenel
feared
that
england
and
france
would
get
into
serious
trouble
if
the
north
agreed
to
accede
on
privateering
and
the
south
did
not
cowley
reported
that
he
had
argued
with
thouvenel
that
privateers
were
pirates
and
ought
to
be
treated
as
such
but
that
thouvenel
refused
to
do
more
than
instruct
mercier
on
the
second
and
third
articles
for
the
moment
russell
appears
to
have
yielded
easily
to
this
french
advice
on
may
he
had
that
interview
with
the
southern
commissioners
in
which
he
mentioned
a
communication
about
to
be
made
to
the
south
and
on
may
the
london
presumably
reflecting
governmental
decision
in
commenting
on
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
developed
at
some
length
the
idea
that
british
citizens
if
they
served
on
southern
privateers
could
claim
no
protection
from
great
britain
if
the
north
chose
to
treat
them
as
pirates
may
cowley
reported
that
thouvenel
had
written
mercier
in
the
terms
of
russell
draft
to
lyons
of
the
eleventh
but
omitting
the
part
about
privateering
and
on
this
same
day
russell
sent
to
cowley
a
copy
of
a
draft
of
instructions
to
lyons
seemingly
in
exact
accord
with
the
french
idea
on
the
seventeenth
cowley
reported
this
as
highly
satisfactory
to
thouvenel
finally
on
may
the
completed
instruction
was
despatched
it
was
on
this
same
day
may
that
adams
had
his
first
interview
with
russell
all
that
had
been
planned
by
great
britain
and
france
had
been
based
on
their
estimate
of
the
necessity
of
the
situation
they
had
no
knowledge
of
seward
instructions
of
april
when
therefore
adams
toward
the
conclusion
of
his
interview
stated
his
authority
to
negotiate
a
convention
he
undoubtedly
took
russell
by
surprise
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
a
suggestion
to
the
north
the
result
of
an
agreement
made
with
france
after
some
discussion
and
delay
was
in
fact
completed
and
the
draft
finally
drawn
days
on
the
sixteenth
even
if
not
actually
sent
as
henry
adams
thinks
it
was
a
completed
agreement
russell
might
well
speak
of
it
as
an
instruction
already
given
to
lyons
moreover
there
were
two
points
in
conversation
of
the
eighteenth
likely
to
give
russell
cause
for
thought
the
first
was
adams
protest
against
the
british
recognition
of
a
status
of
belligerency
if
the
north
felt
so
earnestly
about
this
had
it
been
wise
to
instruct
lyons
to
make
an
approach
to
the
south
this
required
consideration
and
in
the
second
place
did
not
adams
offer
again
open
up
the
prospect
of
somehow
getting
from
the
north
at
least
a
formal
and
permanent
renunciation
of
privateering
for
if
an
examination
is
made
of
russell
instruction
to
lyons
of
may
it
appears
that
he
had
not
after
all
dropped
that
reference
to
privateering
which
thouvenel
had
omitted
in
his
own
instructions
to
mercier
adams
understood
russell
to
have
said
that
he
had
already
transmitted
authority
to
lyons
to
assent
to
any
modification
of
the
only
point
in
issue
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
might
prefer
on
that
matter
he
believed
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
whatever
this
clearly
referred
to
privateering
instructions
to
lyons
took
up
the
points
of
the
declaration
of
paris
in
reverse
order
that
on
blockades
was
now
generally
accepted
by
all
nations
the
principle
of
the
third
article
had
long
been
recognized
as
law
both
in
great
britain
and
in
the
united
states
the
second
article
sanctioned
by
the
united
states
in
the
earliest
period
of
the
history
of
their
independence
had
been
opposed
formerly
by
great
britain
but
having
acquiesced
in
the
declaration
of
she
means
to
adhere
to
the
principle
she
then
adopted
thus
briefly
stating
his
confidence
that
the
united
states
would
agree
on
three
of
the
articles
russell
explained
at
length
his
views
as
to
privateering
in
the
american
crisis
there
remains
only
to
be
considered
article
i
namely
that
relating
to
privateering
from
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
withheld
their
assent
under
these
circumstances
it
is
expedient
to
consider
what
is
required
on
this
subject
by
the
general
law
of
nations
now
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
privateers
bearing
the
flag
of
one
or
other
of
the
belligerents
may
be
manned
by
lawless
and
abandoned
men
who
may
commit
for
the
sake
of
plunder
the
most
destructive
and
sanguinary
outrages
there
can
be
no
question
however
but
that
the
commander
and
crew
of
a
ship
bearing
a
letter
of
marque
must
by
the
law
of
nations
carry
on
their
hostilities
according
to
the
established
laws
of
war
her
majesty
government
must
therefore
hold
any
government
issuing
such
letters
of
marque
responsible
for
and
liable
to
make
good
any
losses
sustained
by
her
majesty
subjects
in
consequence
of
wrongful
proceedings
of
vessels
sailing
under
such
letters
of
marque
in
this
way
the
object
of
the
declaration
of
paris
may
to
a
certain
extent
be
attained
without
the
adoption
of
any
new
principle
you
will
urge
these
points
upon
mr
seward
what
did
russell
mean
by
this
cautious
statement
the
facts
known
to
him
were
that
davis
had
proclaimed
the
issue
of
letters
of
marque
and
that
lincoln
had
countered
by
proclaiming
southern
privateering
to
be
piracy
he
did
not
know
that
seward
was
prepared
to
renounce
privateering
but
he
must
have
thought
it
likely
from
proclamation
and
have
regarded
this
as
a
good
time
to
strike
for
an
object
desired
by
all
the
european
maritime
nations
since
russell
could
not
while
great
britain
was
neutral
join
the
united
states
in
treating
southern
privateers
as
pirates
but
he
here
offered
to
come
as
close
to
it
as
he
dared
by
asserting
that
great
britain
would
use
vigilance
in
upholding
the
law
of
nations
this
language
might
be
interpreted
as
intended
for
the
admonition
of
the
north
also
but
the
of
the
then
known
situation
make
it
applicable
to
southern
activities
alone
russell
had
desired
to
include
privateering
in
the
proposals
to
the
united
states
and
to
the
south
but
criticisms
forced
him
to
a
of
suggestion
to
the
north
and
a
full
statement
of
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
in
the
less
formal
letter
to
lyons
accompanying
his
official
instructions
this
was
also
dated
may
in
it
russell
directed
lyons
to
transmit
to
the
british
consul
at
charleston
or
new
orleans
a
copy
of
the
official
instruction
to
be
communicated
at
montgomery
to
the
president
of
the
confederate
states
and
he
further
explained
his
purpose
and
the
british
position
you
will
not
err
in
encouraging
the
government
to
which
you
are
accredited
to
carry
into
effect
any
disposition
which
they
may
evince
to
recognize
the
declaration
of
paris
in
regard
to
privateering
you
will
clearly
understand
that
her
majesty
government
can
not
accept
the
renunciation
of
privateering
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
if
coupled
with
the
condition
that
they
should
enforce
its
renunciation
on
the
confederate
states
either
by
denying
their
right
to
issue
letters
of
marque
or
by
interfering
with
the
belligerent
operations
of
vessels
holding
from
them
such
letters
of
marque
so
long
as
they
carry
on
hostilities
according
to
the
recognized
principles
and
under
the
admitted
liabilities
of
the
law
of
nations
certainly
this
was
clear
enough
and
was
demanded
by
the
british
policy
of
neutrality
russell
had
guarded
against
the
complication
feared
by
thouvenel
but
he
still
hoped
by
a
to
the
north
and
a
to
the
south
to
secure
from
both
belligerents
a
renunciation
of
privateering
in
short
he
was
not
yet
fully
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
the
french
limitation
moreover
he
believed
that
thouvenel
might
yet
be
won
to
his
own
opinion
for
in
an
unprinted
portion
of
this
same
private
letter
to
lyons
of
may
russell
wrote
i
have
further
to
state
to
you
with
reference
to
my
despatch
of
this
day
that
govt
were
in
the
first
instance
inclined
to
propose
to
both
of
the
contending
parties
to
adopt
the
first
clause
of
the
declaration
of
paris
by
which
privateering
is
renounced
but
after
communication
with
the
french
govt
it
appeared
best
to
limit
our
propositions
in
the
manner
explained
in
my
despatch
i
understand
however
from
lord
cowley
that
although
mercier
is
not
absolutely
instructed
to
advert
to
the
abolition
of
privateering
yet
that
some
latitude
of
action
is
left
to
him
on
that
point
should
he
deem
it
advisable
to
exercise
it
lyons
and
mercier
saw
more
clearly
than
did
russell
what
was
in
mind
lyons
had
been
instructed
in
the
despatch
just
cited
to
use
his
own
discretion
as
to
joint
action
with
the
french
minister
so
long
only
as
the
two
countries
took
the
same
stand
he
was
to
pursue
whatever
method
seemed
most
conciliatory
his
first
private
comment
on
receiving
russell
instruction
was
seward
will
be
furious
when
he
finds
that
his
adherence
to
the
declaration
of
paris
will
not
stop
the
southern
privateering
and
in
an
official
confidential
despatch
of
the
same
day
june
he
gave
russell
clear
warning
of
what
seward
expected
from
his
overture
through
adams
so
delicate
did
the
matter
appear
to
lyons
and
mercier
that
they
agreed
to
keep
quiet
for
a
time
at
least
about
their
instructions
hoping
to
be
relieved
by
the
transfer
of
the
whole
matter
to
london
and
paris
but
in
london
russell
was
at
this
moment
taking
up
again
his
favoured
purpose
on
june
he
wrote
to
grey
temporarily
replacing
cowley
at
paris
that
he
understood
a
communication
had
been
made
in
paris
as
in
london
for
an
american
adherence
to
the
declaration
of
paris
it
may
open
the
way
to
the
abolition
of
privateering
all
over
the
world
but
we
ought
not
to
use
any
menace
to
the
confederate
states
with
a
view
of
obtaining
this
desirable
object
evidently
in
his
opinion
the
south
would
not
dare
to
hold
out
and
no
menace
would
be
required
six
days
later
however
having
learned
from
the
french
ambassador
that
dayton
in
paris
had
made
clear
to
thouvenel
the
expectation
of
the
united
states
that
france
would
treat
southern
privateers
as
pirates
russell
wrote
that
england
of
course
could
not
agree
to
any
such
conclusion
nevertheless
this
did
not
mean
that
russell
yet
saw
any
real
objection
to
concluding
a
convention
with
the
united
states
apparently
he
could
not
believe
that
so
obvious
an
inconsistency
with
the
declared
neutrality
of
great
britain
was
expected
to
be
obtained
by
the
american
secretary
of
state
others
were
more
suspicious
lyons
reported
on
june
that
seward
had
specifically
informed
mercier
of
his
belief
that
a
convention
signed
would
bind
england
and
france
to
aid
in
suppressing
southern
privateering
the
effect
of
this
on
lyons
and
mercier
was
to
impress
upon
them
the
advisability
of
an
notification
to
seward
of
english
and
french
neutrality
a
step
not
yet
taken
and
which
was
still
postponed
awaiting
further
instructions
on
june
the
two
ministers
finally
concluded
they
could
no
longer
delay
and
made
that
joint
visit
to
seward
which
resulted
in
his
refusal
to
receive
them
as
acting
together
or
to
receive
officially
their
instructions
though
he
read
these
for
his
private
information
the
remainder
of
june
was
spent
by
lyons
in
attempting
to
put
matters
on
a
more
formal
basis
yet
not
pushing
them
unduly
for
fear
of
arousing
seward
anger
june
lyons
told
seward
privately
and
alone
that
great
britain
have
some
intercourse
with
the
south
if
only
for
the
protection
of
british
interests
seward
reply
was
that
the
united
states
might
shut
its
eyes
to
this
but
that
if
notified
of
what
england
and
france
were
doing
the
united
states
would
be
compelled
to
make
protest
lyons
thereupon
urged
seward
to
distinguish
between
his
official
and
personal
knowledge
but
lyons
and
mercier
again
postponed
beginning
the
negotiation
with
the
confederacy
yet
while
thus
reporting
this
postponement
in
one
letter
lyons
in
another
letter
of
the
same
date
indicated
that
the
two
ministers
thought
that
they
had
found
a
solution
of
the
problem
of
how
to
approach
yet
not
negotiate
with
the
confederacy
the
idea
was
mercier
their
consuls
in
the
south
were
to
be
instructed
to
go
not
to
the
southern
president
but
to
the
governor
of
the
state
selected
thus
avoiding
any
overture
to
the
confederate
government
even
with
this
solution
possible
they
still
hesitated
feeling
as
lyons
wrote
a
little
pusillanimous
but
believing
they
had
prevented
an
explosion
moreover
lyons
was
a
bit
uneasy
because
of
an
important
difference
so
it
seemed
to
him
in
his
formal
instructions
and
those
of
mercier
the
latter
had
no
orders
as
had
lyons
to
notify
seward
if
the
agreement
on
maritime
law
was
made
in
washington
that
such
agreement
would
not
affect
the
belligerent
right
of
the
south
to
issue
privateers
apparently
mercier
had
been
given
no
instructions
to
make
this
clear
let
alone
any
latitude
to
deal
with
privateering
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
already
given
seward
his
personal
opinion
in
accord
with
lyons
instructions
but
this
was
not
an
official
french
stand
lyons
was
therefore
greatly
relieved
the
misunderstanding
now
cleared
away
that
new
instructions
were
being
sent
to
adams
to
go
on
with
the
convention
in
london
his
only
subsequent
comment
of
moment
was
sent
to
russell
on
july
when
he
learned
from
seward
that
dayton
in
paris
had
been
directed
to
raise
no
further
question
as
to
what
would
or
would
not
be
demanded
of
france
in
case
a
convention
were
signed
for
an
american
adherence
to
the
declaration
of
paris
lyons
now
repeated
his
former
advice
that
under
no
circumstances
should
a
convention
be
signed
without
a
distinct
declaration
of
no
british
responsibility
or
duty
as
regards
southern
privateers
the
entire
matter
was
now
transferred
to
london
and
paris
lyons
report
of
the
misunderstanding
and
that
new
instructions
were
being
sent
to
adams
was
received
on
june
russell
replied
to
lyons
on
july
that
adams
had
never
made
any
proposition
on
the
declaration
of
paris
and
that
he
would
now
await
one
july
adams
made
his
formal
offer
to
sign
a
convention
and
communicated
a
draft
of
it
on
the
thirteenth
on
the
day
intervening
the
twelfth
russell
took
a
very
important
step
indicative
of
his
sincerity
throughout
of
his
lack
of
any
ulterior
motive
and
of
his
anxiety
to
carry
through
the
negotiation
with
no
resulting
irritations
or
complications
with
the
united
states
he
recalled
his
instructions
to
lyons
about
communicating
with
the
confederacy
stating
that
in
any
case
he
had
never
intended
that
lyons
should
act
without
first
officially
notifying
seward
this
recall
was
now
made
he
wrote
because
to
go
on
might
create
fresh
irritation
without
any
adequate
result
but
if
in
the
meantime
lyons
had
already
started
negotiations
with
the
south
he
might
proceed
in
them
to
the
end
having
taken
this
step
in
the
hope
that
it
might
avert
friction
with
the
united
states
russell
now
distinctly
eager
to
secure
american
adherence
to
the
declaration
in
full
was
ready
to
conclude
the
convention
at
once
the
warnings
received
from
many
sources
did
not
dismay
him
he
probably
thought
that
no
actual
difficulties
would
ensue
believing
that
the
south
would
not
venture
to
continue
privateering
even
if
france
were
disinclined
to
make
a
convention
he
appears
to
have
been
ready
for
signature
by
great
britain
alone
for
on
july
he
telegraphed
cowley
i
conclude
there
can
be
no
objection
to
my
signing
a
convention
with
the
minister
giving
the
adherence
of
the
to
the
declaration
of
paris
so
far
as
concerns
gt
britain
answer
immediately
by
telegraph
cowley
replied
on
the
sixteenth
that
thouvenel
could
not
object
but
thought
it
a
wrong
move
cowley
in
a
private
letter
of
the
same
day
thought
that
unless
there
were
very
cogent
reasons
for
signing
a
convention
at
once
with
adams
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
france
could
be
brought
in
and
he
expressed
again
his
fear
of
the
danger
involved
in
adams
proposal
the
same
objection
was
promptly
made
by
palmerston
when
shown
the
draft
of
a
reply
to
adams
palmerston
suggested
the
insertion
of
a
statement
that
while
ready
to
sign
a
convention
great
britain
would
do
so
only
at
the
same
time
with
france
thus
advised
russell
telegraphed
in
the
late
afternoon
of
the
sixteenth
to
cowley
that
he
would
wait
for
your
despatches
and
that
no
reply
had
yet
been
given
adams
and
on
the
seventeenth
he
wrote
enclosing
a
draft
approved
by
palmerston
and
the
queen
stating
that
great
britain
had
no
desire
to
act
alone
if
dayton
really
had
instructions
identical
with
those
of
adams
he
added
that
if
thought
desirable
adams
and
dayton
might
be
informed
verbally
that
the
proposed
convention
would
in
no
way
alter
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
the
remaining
steps
in
the
negotiation
have
already
been
narrated
russell
informed
adams
of
the
requirement
of
a
similar
french
convention
adams
secured
action
by
dayton
and
in
spite
of
continued
french
reluctance
and
suspicion
all
was
ready
in
for
the
affixing
of
signatures
when
russell
in
execution
of
his
previous
promise
and
evidently
now
impressed
with
the
need
of
an
explicit
understanding
gave
notice
of
his
intended
declaration
in
writing
to
be
attached
to
the
convention
on
august
both
adams
and
dayton
refused
to
sign
the
former
taking
the
ground
and
with
evident
sincerity
that
the
exception
gave
evidence
of
a
british
suspicion
that
was
insulting
to
his
country
while
dayton
had
hardly
concealed
from
thouvenel
that
this
same
exception
was
the
very
object
of
the
convention
while
preparing
his
rejoinder
to
adams
complaint
russell
wrote
in
a
note
to
palmerston
it
all
looks
as
if
a
trap
had
been
prepared
he
too
at
last
was
forced
to
a
conclusion
long
since
reached
by
every
other
diplomat
save
adams
engaged
in
this
negotiation
but
in
reviewing
the
details
of
the
entire
affair
it
would
appear
that
in
its
initiation
by
seward
there
is
no
proof
that
he
then
thought
of
any
definite
trap
april
antedated
any
knowledge
by
seward
of
british
or
french
policy
on
neutrality
and
he
was
engaged
in
attempting
to
secure
a
friendly
attitude
by
foreign
powers
one
means
of
doing
this
was
by
giving
assurances
on
maritime
law
in
time
of
war
true
he
probably
foresaw
an
advantage
through
expected
aid
in
repressing
privateering
but
primarily
he
hoped
to
persuade
the
maritime
powers
not
to
recognize
southern
belligerency
it
was
in
fact
this
question
of
belligerency
that
determined
all
his
policy
throughout
the
first
six
months
of
the
american
conflict
he
was
obstinately
determined
to
maintain
that
no
such
status
existed
and
throughout
the
whole
war
he
returned
again
and
again
to
pressure
on
foreign
powers
to
recall
their
proclamations
of
neutrality
refusing
to
recognize
foreign
neutrality
as
final
seward
persisted
in
this
negotiation
in
the
hope
that
if
completed
it
would
place
great
britain
and
france
in
a
position
where
they
would
be
forced
to
reconsider
their
declared
policy
a
demand
upon
them
to
aid
in
suppressing
privateering
might
indeed
then
be
used
as
an
argument
but
the
object
was
not
privateering
in
itself
that
object
was
the
recall
of
the
recognition
of
southern
belligerency
in
the
end
he
simply
could
not
agree
to
the
limiting
declaration
for
it
would
have
constituted
an
acknowledgment
by
the
united
states
itself
of
the
existence
of
a
state
of
war
in
all
of
this
adams
seemingly
had
no
share
he
acted
on
the
simple
and
straightforward
theory
that
the
united
states
pursuing
a
conciliatory
policy
was
now
offering
to
adhere
to
international
rules
advocated
by
all
the
maritime
powers
as
a
result
he
felt
both
personally
and
patriotically
aggrieved
that
suspicion
was
directed
toward
the
american
overtures
for
him
the
failure
of
the
negotiation
had
temporarily
at
least
an
unfortunate
result
so
far
as
the
assumed
friendliness
of
earl
russell
to
the
united
states
was
concerned
the
scales
had
fallen
from
his
eyes
his
faith
in
the
straightforwardness
of
any
portion
of
the
ministry
was
gone
and
for
russell
also
the
affair
spelled
a
certain
disillusionment
not
it
is
true
in
the
good
faith
of
adams
for
whom
he
still
preserved
a
high
regard
russell
felt
that
his
policy
of
a
straightforward
british
neutrality
his
quick
acquiescence
in
the
blockade
even
before
actually
effective
his
early
order
closing
british
ports
to
prizes
of
confederate
privateers
were
all
evidences
of
at
least
a
friendly
attitude
toward
the
north
he
may
as
did
nearly
every
englishman
at
the
moment
think
the
of
america
impossible
but
he
had
begun
with
the
plan
of
strict
neutrality
and
certainly
with
no
thought
of
offensive
action
against
the
north
his
first
thought
in
the
declaration
of
paris
negotiation
was
to
persuade
both
belligerents
to
acquiesce
in
a
portion
of
the
rules
of
that
declaration
but
almost
at
once
he
saw
the
larger
advantage
to
the
world
of
a
complete
adherence
by
the
united
states
this
became
russell
fixed
idea
in
which
he
persisted
against
warnings
and
obstacles
because
of
this
he
attempted
to
recall
the
instruction
to
approach
the
south
was
ready
even
until
prohibited
by
palmerston
to
depart
from
a
policy
of
close
joint
action
with
france
and
in
the
end
was
forced
by
that
prohibition
to
make
a
limiting
declaration
guarding
british
neutrality
in
it
all
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
hidden
motive
nor
of
any
other
than
a
straightforward
even
if
obstinately
blind
procedure
the
effect
on
russell
at
last
grudgingly
admitting
that
there
had
been
a
trap
was
as
unfortunate
for
good
understanding
as
in
the
case
of
adams
he
also
was
irritated
suspicious
and
soon
less
convinced
that
a
policy
of
strict
neutrality
could
long
be
maintained

to
the
union
by
the
border
state
policy
of
lincoln
the
first
pronouncement
of
which
asserted
that
the
north
had
no
purpose
of
attacking
slavery
where
it
existed
but
merely
was
determined
to
preserve
the
union
the
northern
congress
meeting
in
extra
session
on
july
heartily
approved
lincoln
emergency
measures
it
authorized
an
army
of
provided
for
a
loan
of
sanctioned
the
issue
of
in
treasury
notes
and
levied
new
taxes
both
direct
and
by
tariffs
to
meet
these
expenditures
in
the
months
preceding
the
attack
on
sumter
the
fixed
determination
of
the
south
to
secede
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
north
had
led
the
british
press
to
believe
that
the
decision
rested
wholly
with
the
south
now
the
north
by
its
preparations
was
exhibiting
an
equally
fixed
determination
to
preserve
the
union
and
while
the
british
press
was
sceptical
of
the
permanence
of
this
determination
it
became
for
a
short
time
until
editorial
policy
was
crystallized
more
cautious
in
prophecy
the
on
may
declared
that
the
responsibility
for
the
fatal
step
rested
wholly
on
southern
leaders
because
of
their
passionate
desire
to
extend
the
shameful
institution
of
which
they
were
so
proud
but
that
the
north
must
inevitably
by
mere
weight
of
population
and
wealth
be
the
victor
though
this
could
not
conceivably
result
in
any
real
reunion
rather
in
a
conquest
requiring
permanent
military
occupation
southern
leaders
were
mad
to
rouse
by
gratuitous
insult
the
mettle
of
a
nation
three
times
as
numerous
and
far
more
than
three
times
as
powerful
to
force
them
by
aggressive
steps
into
a
struggle
in
which
the
sympathy
of
every
free
and
civilized
nation
will
be
with
the
north
seems
like
the
madness
of
men
whose
eyes
are
blinded
and
hearts
hardened
by
the
evil
cause
they
defend
two
weeks
later
the
while
still
maintaining
the
justice
of
the
northern
cause
though
with
lessened
vigour
appealed
to
the
common
sense
of
the
north
to
refrain
from
a
civil
war
whose
professed
object
was
unattainable
everyone
knows
and
admits
that
the
secession
is
an
accomplished
irrevocable
fact
even
if
the
north
were
sure
of
an
easy
and
complete
victory
short
of
course
of
actual
subjugation
of
the
south
which
no
one
dreams
of
the
war
which
was
to
end
in
such
a
victory
would
still
be
in
the
eyes
of
prudence
and
worldly
wisdom
an
objectless
and
unprofitable
folly
but
by
the
middle
of
june
the
american
irritation
at
the
british
proclamation
of
neutrality
loudly
and
angrily
voiced
by
the
northern
press
had
caused
a
british
press
resentment
at
this
wilful
misrepresentation
and
misjudgment
of
british
attitude
we
believe
the
secession
of
the
slave
states
to
be
a
a
completed
and
irreversible
transaction
we
believe
it
to
be
impossible
now
for
the
north
to
lure
back
the
south
into
the
union
by
any
compromise
or
to
compel
them
back
by
any
force
if
this
is
an
offence
it
can
not
be
helped
the
majority
of
the
london
papers
though
not
all
passed
through
the
same
shifts
of
opinion
and
expression
as
the
first
upbraiding
the
south
next
appealing
to
the
north
not
to
wage
a
useless
war
finally
committing
themselves
to
the
theory
of
an
accomplished
of
the
union
and
berating
the
north
for
continuing
through
pride
alone
a
bloody
conflict
doomed
to
failure
meanwhile
in
midsummer
attention
was
diverted
from
the
ethical
causes
at
issue
by
the
publication
in
the
of
motley
letter
analysing
the
nature
of
the
american
constitution
and
defending
the
legal
position
of
the
north
in
its
resistance
to
secession
motley
wrote
in
protest
against
the
general
british
press
attitude
there
is
perhaps
a
readiness
in
england
to
prejudge
the
case
a
disposition
not
to
exult
in
our
downfall
but
to
accept
the
fact
he
argued
the
right
and
the
duty
of
the
north
to
force
the
south
into
subjection
the
right
of
revolution
is
indisputable
it
is
written
on
the
record
of
our
race
british
and
american
history
is
made
up
of
rebellion
and
revolution
there
can
be
nothing
plainer
then
than
the
american
right
of
revolution
but
then
it
should
be
called
revolution
it
is
strange
that
englishmen
should
find
difficulty
in
understanding
that
the
united
states
government
is
a
nation
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
a
constituted
authority
which
may
be
overthrown
by
violence
as
may
be
the
fate
of
any
state
whether
kingdom
or
republic
but
which
is
false
to
the
people
if
it
does
not
its
best
to
preserve
them
from
the
horrors
of
anarchy
even
at
the
cost
of
blood
motley
denied
any
of
secession
and
his
constitutional
argument
presented
adequately
the
northern
view
but
he
was
compelled
also
to
refer
to
slavery
and
did
so
in
the
sense
of
lincoln
inaugural
asserting
that
the
north
had
no
purpose
of
emancipating
the
slaves
it
was
no
question
at
all
that
slavery
within
a
state
was
sacred
from
all
interference
by
the
general
government
or
by
the
free
states
or
by
individuals
in
those
states
and
the
chicago
convention
which
nominated
lincoln
strenuously
asserted
that
doctrine
coming
at
the
moment
when
the
british
press
and
public
were
seeking
ground
for
a
shift
from
earlier
expressions
of
sympathy
to
some
justification
for
the
south
it
may
be
doubted
whether
motley
letter
did
not
do
more
harm
than
good
to
the
northern
cause
his
denial
of
a
northern
purpose
gave
excuse
for
a
professedly
more
calm
and
judicial
examination
of
the
claimed
of
secession
and
his
legal
argument
could
be
met
and
was
met
with
equally
logical
apparently
argument
as
to
the
nature
of
the
american
constitution
thus
early
did
the
necessity
of
lincoln
border
state
policy
a
policy
which
extended
even
to
warnings
from
seward
to
american
diplomats
abroad
not
to
bring
into
consideration
the
future
of
slavery
give
ground
for
foreign
denial
that
there
were
any
great
moral
principles
at
stake
in
the
american
conflict
in
the
meantime
the
two
sections
in
america
were
busily
preparing
for
a
test
of
strength
and
for
that
test
the
british
press
reporting
preparations
waited
with
interest
it
came
on
july
in
the
first
battle
of
bull
run
when
approximately
equal
forces
of
raw
levies
each
met
in
the
first
pitched
battle
of
the
war
and
where
the
northern
army
after
an
initial
success
ultimately
fled
in
disgraceful
rout
before
bull
run
the
few
british
papers
early
taking
strong
ground
for
the
north
had
pictured
lincoln
preparations
as
so
tremendous
as
inevitably
destined
to
crush
quickly
all
southern
resistance
the
lauded
lincoln
message
to
congress
as
the
speech
of
a
great
leader
and
asserted
that
the
issue
in
america
was
for
all
free
people
a
question
of
upholding
the
eternal
principles
of
liberty
morality
and
justice
war
for
such
a
cause
though
it
be
civil
war
may
perhaps
without
impiety
be
called
most
perfect
instrument
in
working
out
a
pure
intent
the
disaster
to
the
northern
army
its
apparent
testimony
that
the
north
lacked
real
fighting
men
bolstered
that
british
opinion
which
regarded
military
measures
against
the
south
as
folly
an
impression
reinforced
in
the
next
few
months
by
the
long
pause
by
the
north
before
undertaking
any
further
great
effort
in
the
field
the
north
was
not
really
ready
for
determined
war
indeed
until
later
in
the
year
meanwhile
many
were
the
moralizations
in
the
british
press
upon
bull
run
revelation
of
northern
military
weakness
probably
the
most
influential
newspaper
utterances
of
the
moment
were
the
letters
of
russell
to
the
this
famous
had
been
sent
to
america
in
the
spring
of
by
delane
editor
of
the
his
first
letter
written
on
march
appearing
in
the
issue
of
april
he
travelled
through
the
south
was
met
everywhere
with
eager
courtesy
as
became
a
man
of
his
reputation
and
one
representing
the
most
important
organ
of
british
public
opinion
returned
to
the
north
in
late
june
and
at
washington
was
given
intimate
interviews
by
seward
and
other
leaders
for
a
time
his
utterances
were
watched
for
in
both
england
and
america
with
the
greatest
interest
and
expectancy
as
the
opinions
of
an
unusually
able
and
thoroughly
honest
dispassionate
observer
he
never
concealed
his
abhorrence
of
slavery
terming
apologists
of
that
institution
the
miserable
sophists
who
expose
themselves
to
the
contempt
of
the
world
by
their
paltry
theiscles
on
the
divine
origin
and
uses
of
slavery
and
writing
day
after
day
the
impression
of
my
mind
was
strengthened
that
rights
meant
protection
to
slavery
extension
of
slave
territory
and
in
slave
produce
with
the
other
world
but
at
the
same
time
he
depicted
the
energy
ability
and
determination
of
the
south
in
high
colours
and
was
a
bit
doubtful
of
similar
virtues
in
the
north
the
battle
of
bull
run
itself
he
did
not
see
but
he
rode
out
from
washington
to
meet
the
defeated
army
and
his
description
of
the
routed
rabble
jostling
and
pushing
in
frenzy
toward
the
capitol
so
ridiculed
northern
fighting
spirit
as
to
leave
a
permanent
sting
behind
it
at
the
same
time
it
convinced
the
british
reader
that
the
northern
effort
was
doomed
to
failure
even
though
russell
was
himself
guarded
in
opinion
as
to
ultimate
result
will
england
and
france
think
of
it
is
the
question
which
is
asked
over
and
over
again
wrote
russell
on
july
expatiating
on
american
anxiety
and
chagrin
in
the
face
of
probable
foreign
opinion
on
august
he
recorded
in
his
diary
the
beginnings
of
the
american
newspaper
storm
of
personal
attack
because
of
his
description
of
the
battle
in
the
an
attack
which
before
long
became
the
alleged
cause
of
his
recall
by
delane
in
fact
russell
letters
added
nothing
in
humiliating
description
to
the
outpourings
of
the
northern
press
itself
greedily
quoted
by
foreign
papers
the
impression
of
northern
military
incapacity
was
not
confined
to
great
britain
it
was
general
throughout
europe
and
for
the
remainder
of
there
were
few
who
ventured
to
assert
a
northern
success
in
the
war
official
britain
however
saw
no
cause
for
any
change
in
the
policy
of
strict
neutrality
palmerston
commented
privately
the
truth
is
the
north
are
fighting
for
an
idea
chiefly
entertained
by
professional
politicians
while
the
south
are
fighting
for
what
they
consider
rightly
or
wrongly
vital
interests
thus
explaining
to
his
own
satisfaction
why
a
northern
army
of
brave
men
had
to
away
but
the
government
was
careful
to
refrain
from
any
official
utterances
likely
to
irritate
the
north
the
battle
served
in
some
degree
to
bring
into
the
open
the
metropolitan
british
papers
which
hitherto
professing
neutrality
and
careful
not
to
reveal
too
openly
their
leanings
now
each
took
a
definite
stand
and
became
an
advocate
of
a
cause
the
duke
of
argyll
might
write
reassuringly
to
motley
to
have
no
fear
of
british
interference
and
to
gladstone
evidently
controverting
the
latter
opinion
that
slavery
was
and
would
continue
to
be
an
object
in
the
war
but
the
press
certainly
was
not
united
either
as
to
future
british
policy
or
on
basic
causes
and
objects
of
the
war
the
believed
that
a
second
southern
victory
like
bull
run
if
coming
soon
would
so
disgust
and
dishearten
the
shouters
for
the
union
that
the
contest
will
be
abandoned
on
the
instant
some
day
with
scarcely
any
notice
we
may
receive
tidings
that
an
armistice
has
been
agreed
upon
and
preliminaries
of
peace
have
been
signed
john
bright
paper
the
argued
long
and
feverishly
that
englishmen
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
slavery
was
an
issue
and
made
appeal
for
expressions
badly
needed
at
the
moment
of
sympathy
to
this
retorted
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
this
that
black
slavery
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
civil
war
in
america
the
people
of
america
have
erected
a
political
idol
the
northerners
have
talked
and
written
and
boasted
so
much
about
their
republic
that
they
have
now
become
perfectly
furious
to
find
that
their
idol
can
be
overthrown
and
that
the
false
principles
upon
which
the
american
republic
is
built
should
be
exhibited
to
the
world
that
their
vaunted
democracy
should
be
exposed
as
a
mere
bubble
or
a
piece
of
rotten
timber
an
abominable
and
worthless
tyranny
of
the
sovereign
mob
here
was
an
early
hint
of
the
future
of
democracy
as
at
issue
the
country
squire
paper
might
venture
to
voice
the
thought
but
more
important
papers
were
still
cautious
in
expressing
it
russell
privately
wrote
to
delane
it
is
quite
obvious
i
think
that
the
north
will
succeed
in
reducing
the
south
but
delane
permitted
no
such
positive
prophecy
to
appear
in
the
darwin
is
good
testimony
of
the
british
feeling
i
hope
to
god
we
english
are
utterly
wrong
in
doubting
whether
the
north
can
conquer
the
south
how
curious
it
is
that
you
seem
to
think
that
you
can
conquer
the
south
and
i
never
meet
a
soul
even
those
who
would
most
wish
it
who
think
it
possible
that
is
to
conquer
and
retain
it
in
september
after
the
first
interest
in
bull
run
had
waned
there
appeared
several
books
and
articles
on
the
american
question
which
gave
opportunity
for
renewal
of
newspaper
comment
and
controversy
a

offered
this
view
as
a
defence

such
a
breaking
up
of
america
was
much
more
likely
to
result
in
a
situation
comparable
to
that
in
south
america
inquired
caustically
whether
bulwer
lytton
had
heard
that
slavery
was
in
question
and
asserted
that
his
speech
presumably
represented
the
official
view
of
the
tories
and
embodied
that
of
the
english
governing
class
in
press
utterances
during
the
autumn
and
early
fall
of
there
is
little
on
british
policy
toward
america
strict
neutrality
is
approved
by
all
papers
and
public
speakers
but
as
the
months
passed
without
further
important
military
engagements
attention
began
to
be
directed
toward
the
economic
effects
on
england
of
the
war
in
america
and
to
the
blockade
now
beginning
to
be
made
effective
by
the
north
the
though
declared
for
neutrality
but
distinguished
between
strict
observance
of
the
blockade
and
a
reasonable
recognition
of
the
government
of
the
confederacy
as
soon
as
the
southern
states
had
achieved
for
their
independence
that
amount
of
security
with
which
great
britain
had
been
satisfied
in
former
cases
but
another
article
in
the
same
issue
contained
a
warning
against
forcibly
raising
the
blockade
since
this
must
lead
to
war
with
the
north
and
that
would
commend
itself
to
no
thoughtful
englishman
two
weeks
later
appeared
a
long
review
of
spence
a
work
very
influential
in
confirming
british
belief
in
the
constitutional
right
of
the
south
to
secede
and
in
the
certainty
of
southern
victory
spence
was
likely
to
succeed
with
english
readers
because
all
his
views
are
taken
from
a
thoroughly
english
standpoint
the
week
following
compliments
are
showered
upon
the
young
professor
montague
bernard
for
his
two
lectures
on
the
present
american
war
in
which
he
distinguished
between
recognition
of
belligerency
and
recognition
of
sovereignty
asserting
that
the
former
was
inevitable
and
logical
the
without
direct
quotation
treated
bernard
as
an
advocate
also
of
the
early
recognition
of
southern
independence
on
the
ground
that
it
was
fait
and
expressed
approval
these
few
citations
taken
with
intent
from
the
more
sober
and
reputable
journals
summarize
the
prevailing
attitude
on
one
side
or
the
other
throughout
the
months
from
june
to
december
all
publications
had
much
to
say
of
the
american
struggle
and
varied
in
tone
from
dignified
criticism
to
extreme
vituperation
this
last
usually
being
the
resort
of
lesser
journals
whose
leader
writers
had
no
skill
in
vigorous
writing
in
a
seemingly
restrained
manner
vigorous
leader
writing
was
a
characteristic
of
the
british
press
of
the
day
and
when
combined
with
a
supercilious
british
tone
of
advice
as
from
a
superior
nation
gave
great
offence
to
americans
whether
north
or
south
but
the
british
press
was
yet
united
in
proclaiming
as
correct
the
governmental
policy
of
neutrality
and
in
any
event
motley
was
right
in
stating
the
press
is
not
the
government
adding
his
opinion
that
the
present
english
government
has
thus
far
given
us
no
just
cause
of
offence
meanwhile
the
government
just
at
the
moment
when
the
declaration
of
paris
negotiation
had
reached
an
inglorious
conclusion
especially
irritating
to
earl
russell
was
suddenly
plunged
into
a
sharp
controversy
with
the
united
states
by
an
incident
growing
out
of
russell
first
instructions
to
lyons
in
regard
to
that
negotiation
and
which
though
of
minor
importance
in
itself
aroused
an
intensity
of
feeling
beyond
its
merits
this
was
the
recall
by
seward
of
the
exequatur
of
the
british
consul
bunch
at
charleston
south
carolina
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
his
first
instruction
to
lyons
on
the
declaration
of
paris
russell
had
directed
that
bunch
at
charleston
be
commissioned
to
seek
a
southern
official
acceptance
of
the
binding
force
of
the
second
and
third
articles
but
that
lyons
and
mercier
fearing
seward
irritation
had
hesitated
to
proceed
in
the
matter
later
russell
had
recalled
his
instructions
but
before
this
recall
could
reach
lyons
the
latter
had
decided
to
act
on
july
lyons
gave
explicit
directions
to
bunch
not
to
approach
the
confederate
government
directly
but
to
go
to
governor
pickens
of
south
carolina
and
explain
the
matter
to
him
verbally
adding
you
should
act
with
great
caution
in
order
to
avoid
raising
the
question
of
the
recognition
of
the
new
confederation
by
great
britain
unfortunately
lyons
also
wrote
i
am
authorized
by
lord
john
russell
to
confide
the
negotiation
on
this
matter
to
you
thus
after
all
implying
that
a
real
with
the
south
was
being
undertaken
on
the
same
day
mercier
sent
similar
instructions
to
andré
the
french
at
charleston
bunch
received
lyons
official
letter
on
july
together
with
a
private
one
of
july
emphasizing
that
bunch
was
to
put
nothing
in
writing
and
that
he
and
his
french
colleagues
were
to
keep
the
names
of
lyons
and
mercier
out
of
any
talk
even
about
the
matter
bunch
was
to
talk
as
if
his
instructions
came
directly
from
russell
lyons
hoped
the
south
would
be
wise
enough
not
to
indulge
in
undue
publicity
since
if
trumpeted
it
might
elicit
by
such
conduct
some
strong
disavowal
from
france
and
england
both
the
official
and
the
private
letter
must
however
have
impressed
bunch
with
the
idea
that
this
was
after
all
a
negotiation
and
that
he
had
been
entrusted
with
it
bunch
whose
early
reports
had
been
far
from
sympathetic
with
the
southern
cause
had
gradually
and
quite
naturally
from
his
environment
become
more
friendly
to
it
he
now
acted
with
promptness
and
with
some
evident
exultation
at
the
importance
given
him
personally
in
place
of
governor
pickens
an
experienced
diplomat
william
henry
trescott
was
approached
by
bunch
and
belligny
who
not
andré
was
then
the
french
agent
at
charleston
trescott
went
directly
to
president
davis
who
at
once
asked
why
the
british
proposal
had
not
been
made
through
the
confederate
commissioners
in
london
and
who
somewhat
unwillingly
yielded
to
trescott
urging
on
august
the
confederate
congress
resolved
approval
of
the
declaration
of
paris
except
for
the
article
on
privateering
bunch
took
great
pride
in
the
secrecy
observed
i
do
not
see
how
any
clue
is
given
to
the
way
in
which
the
resolutions
have
been
procured
we
made
a
positive
stipulation
that
france
and
england
were
not
to
be
alluded
to
in
the
event
of
the
compliance
of
the
confederate
govt
he
wrote
lyons
on
august
but
he
failed
to
take
account
either
of
the
penetrating
power
of
gossip
or
of
the
efficacy
of
seward
secret
agents
on
this
same
day
august
lyons
reported
the
arrest
in
new
york
on
the
fourteenth
of
one
robert
mure
just
as
he
was
about
to
take
passage
for
liverpool
carrying
a
sealed
bag
from
the
charleston
consulate
to
the
british
foreign
office
as
well
as
some
two
hundred
private
letters
the
letters
were
examined
and
among
them
was
one
which
related
recent
activities
and
stated
that
on
oath
of
secrecy
communicated
to
me
also
that
the
first
step
of
recognition
was
taken
the
sealed
bag
was
sent
unopened
to
be
handed
by
adams
to
russell
with
an
enquiry
whether
in
fact
it
contained
any
papers
on
the
alleged
negotiation
with
the
south
bunch
had
issued
to
mure
a
paper
which
the
latter
regarded
as
a
passport
as
did
the
united
states
this
also
was
made
matter
of
complaint
by
adams
when
on
september
the
affair
was
presented
to
russell
america
complained
of
bunch
on
several
counts
the
three
principal
ones
being
that
he
had
apparently
conducted
a
negotiation
with
the
confederacy
that
he
had
issued
a
passport
not
countersigned
by
the
secretary
of
state
as
required
by
the
united
states
rules
respecting
foreign
consuls
that
he
had
permitted
the
person
to
whom
this
passport
was
issued
to
carry
letters
from
the
enemies
of
the
united
states
to
their
agents
abroad
on
these
grounds
the
british
government
was
requested
to
remove
bunch
from
his
office
on
first
learning
of
mure
arrest
lyons
expressed
the
firm
belief
that
conduct
had
been
perfectly
proper
and
that
the
sealed
bag
would
be
found
to
contain
nothing
supporting
the
suspicion
of
the
american
government
the
language
used
by
lyons
was
such
as
to
provide
an
excellent
defence
in
published
despatches
and
it
was
later
so
used
but
privately
neither
lyons
nor
russell
were
wholly
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
bunch
actions
bunch
had
heard
of
mure
arrest
on
august
and
at
once
protested
that
no
passport
had
been
given
but
merely
a
certificate
to
the
effect
that
he
mure
was
a
british
merchant
residing
in
charleston
on
his
way
to
england
and
that
he
was
carrying
official
despatches
to
the
foreign
office
in
fact
mure
had
long
since
taken
out
american
citizenship
papers
and
the
distinction
between
passport
and
certificate
seems
an
evasion
officially
lyons
could
report
it
is
clear
that
robert
mure
in
taking
charge
of
the
letters
which
have
been
seized
abused
mr
confidence
for
mr
bunch
had
positive
instructions
from
me
not
to
forward
himself
any
letters
alluding
to
military
or
political
events
excepting
letters
to
or
from
british
officials
this
made
good
reading
when
put
in
the
published
parliamentary
papers
but
in
reality
the
sending
of
private
letters
by
messenger
also
carrying
an
official
pouch
was
no
novelty
bunch
had
explained
to
lyons
on
june
that
this
was
his
practice
on
the
ground
that
there
is
really
no
way
left
for
the
merchants
but
through
me
if
seward
objects
i
can
not
help
it
i
must
leave
it
to
your
lordship
and
government
to
support
me
my
own
despatch
to
lord
russell
i
must
send
in
some
way
and
so
i
take
the
responsibility
of
aiding
british
interests
by
sending
the
mercantile
letters
as
well
and
in
bunch
printed
report
to
lyons
on
arrest
his
reply
as
to
the
private
letters
was
i
could
not
consider
him
mure
as
being
disqualified
from
being
the
bearer
of
a
bag
to
earl
russell
by
his
doing
what
everyone
who
left
charleston
was
doing
daily
officially
lyons
on
september
had
reported
a
conversation
with
belligny
the
french
consul
at
charleston
now
in
washington
writing
i
am
confirmed
in
the
opinion
that
the
negotiation
which
was
difficult
and
delicate
was
managed
with
great
tact
and
good
judgment
by
the
two
consuls
but
this
referred
merely
to
the
use
of
trescott
and
its
results
not
to
bunch
use
of
mure
the
british
government
was
indeed
prepared
to
defend
the
action
of
its
agents
in
securing
from
the
south
an
acknowledgment
of
certain
principles
of
international
law
russell
did
not
believe
that
lincoln
was
foolhardy
enough
to
quarrel
with
england
and
france
though
hammond
under
secretary
of
foreign
affairs
is
persuaded
that
seward
wishes
to
pick
a
quarrel
enquiry
was
promptly
made
of
france
through
cowley
as
to
her
stand
in
the
matter
of
the
consuls
at
charleston
russell
intimating
by
an
enquiry
later
printed
in
the
parliamentary
papers
as
to
the
initiation
of
the
declaration
of
paris
negotiations
that
it
was
thouvenel
who
had
first
suggested
the
approach
to
the
south
through
the
consuls
this
was
an
error
of
memory
and
cowley
was
perturbed
by
thouvenel
reticence
in
reply
to
the
main
question
the
latter
stated
that
if
a
like
american
demand
were
made
on
france
undoubtedly
he
could
not
give
up
an
agent
who
had
done
no
more
than
execute
the
orders
entrusted
to
him
this
looked
like
harmony
but
the
situation
for
the
two
countries
was
not
the
same
as
no
demand
had
been
made
for
the
recall
of
belligny
cowley
was
in
reality
anxious
and
suspicious
for
thouvenel
in
conversation
attributed
seward
anger
to
bunch
alleged
indiscretions
in
talk
and
made
it
clear
that
france
would
not
stand
by
unless
seward
should
protest
to
france
against
the
fact
of
a
communication
not
a
having
been
held
with
the
confederacy
before
the
french
reply
was
secured
russell
had
prepared
but
not
sent
an
answer
to
adams
notifying
him
that
the
bag
from
bunch
on
examination
was
found
not
to
contain
correspondence
of
the
enemies
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
had
been
suspected
and
transmitting
a
copy
of
bunch
explanation
of
the
reason
for
forwarding
private
letters
in
another
letter
to
adams
of
the
same
date
russell
avowed
the
government
responsibility
for
action
on
the
declaration
of
paris
and
declined
to
recall
him
adding
but
when
it
is
stated
in
a
letter
from
some
person
not
named
that
the
first
step
to
the
recognition
of
the
southern
states
by
great
britain
has
been
taken
the
undersigned
begs
to
decline
all
responsibility
for
such
a
statement
her
majesty
government
have
already
recognized
the
belligerent
character
of
the
southern
states
and
they
will
continue
to
recognize
them
as
belligerents
but
her
government
have
not
recognized
and
are
not
prepared
to
recognize
the
confederate
states
as
a
separate
and
independent
state
adams
received
russell
two
notes
on
september
and
merely
stated
that
they
would
be
despatched
by
the
next
steamer
that
russell
was
anxious
is
shown
by
a
careful
letter
of
caution
to
lyons
instructing
him
if
sent
away
from
washington
to
express
in
the
most
dignified
and
guarded
terms
that
the
course
taken
by
the
washington
government
must
be
the
result
of
a
misconception
on
their
part
and
that
you
shall
retire
to
canada
in
the
persuasion
that
the
misunderstanding
will
soon
cease
and
the
former
friendly
relations
be
restored
meantime
russell
was
far
from
satisfied
with
bunch
writing
lyons
to
inform
him
that
the
statements
made
in
regard
to
his
proceedings
require
explanation
the
failure
of
seward
to
demand
belligny
recall
worried
russell
he
wrote
to
palmerston
on
september
i
can
not
believe
that
the
americans
having
made
no
demand
on
the
french
to
disavow
belligny
or
baligny
will
send
away
lyons
and
he
thought
that
seward
ought
to
be
satisfied
as
england
had
disavowed
the
offensive
part
of
bunch
supposed
utterances
he
was
not
in
favour
of
sending
reinforcements
to
the
american
stations
if
they
do
not
quarrel
about
bunch
we
may
rest
on
our
oars
for
the
winter
there
was
nothing
further
to
do
save
to
wait
seward
action
on
receipt
of
the
british
refusal
to
recall
bunch
at
this
moment
lyons
at
washington
was
writing
in
a
hopeful
view
of
avoiding
abstract
assertions
of
principles
but
accustoming
the
north
to
the
of
british
recognition
of
southern
belligerent
rights
lyons
believed
that
seward
would
not
go
further
than
to
withdraw
bunch
exequatur
but
he
was
anxious
for
the
return
of
mercier
long
absent
with
prince
napoleon
since
our
position
is
unluckily
not
exactly
the
same
with
that
of
france
on
october
lyons
conferred
at
length
with
seward
on
the
bunch
matter
as
usual
privately
and
unofficially
seward
dwelt
on
a
letter
just
received
from
motley
assuring
him
that
great
britain
was
not
unfriendly
to
the
united
states
and
appeared
anxious
not
to
pick
a
quarrel
yet
hardly
knowing
how
to
retract
from
his
original
position
lyons
told
seward
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
carry
on
the
diplomatic
business
on
the
false
hypothesis
that
the
united
states
government
did
not
england
and
france
had
recognized
the
belligerent
rights
of
the
south
and
he
urged
russell
to
get
from
france
an
open
acknowledgment
such
as
england
has
made
that
she
negotiated
with
the
confederacy
lyons
thought
mercier
would
try
to
avoid
this
thus
seeking
to
bring
pressure
on
the
british
government
to
adopt
his
plan
of
an
early
recognition
of
southern
independence
like
cowley
lyons
was
disturbed
at
the
french
evasion
of
direct
support
in
the
bunch
affair
bunch
formal
denial
to
lyons
of
the
charges
made
against
him
by
the
united
states
was
confined
to
three
points
he
asserted
his
disbelief
that
mure
carried
any
despatches
from
the
government
at
richmond
he
protested
that
there
was
not
one
single
paper
in
my
bag
which
was
not
entirely
and
altogether
on
her
majesty
service
and
he
explained
the
alleged
passport
was
not
intended
as
such
but
was
merely
a
certificate
stating
that
mure
was
charged
by
me
with
despatches
but
he
acknowledged
that
in
the
certificate
description
of
mure
as
a
british
merchant
a
possible
error
had
been
committed
adding
however
that
he
had
supposed
anyone
would
understand
since
the
words
british
subject
had
not
been
used
that
mure
was
in
reality
a
naturalized
citizen
of
america
this
explanation
was
received
by
russell
on
october
lyons
comment
on
bunch
explanation
made
without
knowledge
of
what
would
be
seward
final
determination
was
that
if
bunch
had
any
further
excuses
to
make
about
the
private
letters
carried
by
mure
he
should
drop
two
weak
points
in
his
argument
i
mean
the
distinction
between
merchant
and
and
the
distinction
between
a
document
requesting
that
the
bearer
be
permitted
to
pass
freely
and
receive
all
proper
protection
and
and
a
passport
russell
on
receipt
of
bunch
explanation
was
also
dissatisfied
first
because
bunch
had
violated
lyons
instructions
against
entrusting
despatches
to
persons
carrying
private
correspondence
and
second
because
bunch
gives
no
distinct
denial
to
the
newspaper
stories
that
he
had
gossiped
about
his
activities
and
had
stated
them
to
be
a
first
step
toward
recognition
these
criticisms
were
directed
entirely
to
bunch
conduct
subsequent
to
the
overture
to
the
south
on
the
propriety
of
that
act
russell
supported
bunch
with
vigour
october
seward
read
to
lyons
the
instruction
to
adams
on
the
revocation
of
bunch
exequatur
the
ground
taken
for
this
reported
lyons
was
an
evasion
of
that
charge
of
communicating
with
the
south
for
which
russell
had
avowed
responsibility
and
a
turning
to
the
charge
that
bunch
was
personally
unacceptable
longer
to
the
united
states
because
of
his
partisanship
to
the
south
as
evidenced
by
various
acts
and
especially
as
shown
by
his
reported
assertion
that
great
britain
had
taken
a
first
step
to
recognition
never
wrote
lyons
were
serious
charges
brought
upon
a
slighter
foundation
no
one
who
has
read
mr
bunch
despatches
to
your
lordship
and
to
me
can
consider
him
as
in
the
least
degree
a
partisan
of
the
southern
cause
when
seward
had
finished
reading
the
despatch
i
remained
silent
after
a
short
pause
i
took
leave
of
him
courteously
and
withdrew
as
will
have
been
noted
lyons
had
foreseen
the
american
decision
against
bunch
on
purely
personal
grounds
had
been
relieved
that
this
would
be
the
issue
and
had
russell
his
despatch
just
cited
may
be
regarded
as
a
suggestion
of
the
proper
british
refutation
of
charges
but
with
acceptance
of
the
american
decision
nevertheless
he
wrote
gloomily
on
the
same
day
of
future
relations
with
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
russell
also
foreseeing
seward
action
was
not
disturbed
he
thought
it
still
not
off
the
cards
that
the
southern
confederates
may
return
to
the
union
our
conduct
must
be
strictly
neutral
and
it
will
be
upon
receipt
of
lyons
despatch
and
letter
of
october
russell
wrote
to
palmerston
i
do
not
attach
much
importance
to
this
letter
of
lyons
it
is
the
business
of
seward
to
feed
the
mob
with
sacrifices
every
day
and
we
happen
to
be
the
most
grateful
food
he
can
offer
for
russell
saw
clearly
that
great
britain
could
not
object
to
the
removal
of
bunch
on
the
purely
personal
grounds
alleged
by
seward
there
followed
in
due
course
the
formal
notification
by
adams
on
november
just
six
days
before
he
learned
of
the
affair
which
had
occurred
on
november
that
alarming
incident
no
doubt
coloured
the
later
communications
of
both
parties
for
while
both
adams
and
russell
indulged
in
several
lengthy
argumentative
papers
such
as
are
dear
to
the
hearts
of
lawyers
and
diplomats
the
only
point
of
possible
further
dispute
was
on
the
claim
of
great
britain
that
future
occasions
might
arise
where
in
defence
of
british
interests
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
to
communicate
with
the
confederacy
adams
acknowledged
a
british
duty
to
protect
its
citizens
but
reasserted
the
american
right
to
dismiss
any
british
agent
who
should
act
as
bunch
had
done
on
december
russell
closed
the
matter
by
stating
that
he
did
not
perceive
that
any
advantage
would
be
obtained
by
the
continuance
of
this
correspondence
bunch
was
expected
to
leave
charleston
as
soon
as
a
safe
conveyance
could
be
provided
for
him
but
this
was
not
immediately
forthcoming
in
fact
he
remained
at
charleston
until
february
actively
engaged
but
official
papers
were
signed
by
his
in
the
excitement
over
the
he
seems
rapidly
to
have
disappeared
from
the
official
as
he
did
from
the
public
horizon
the
bunch
controversy
seemingly
of
no
great
importance
in
so
far
as
the
alleged
personal
grounds
of
complaint
are
concerned
had
its
real
significance
in
the
effort
of
great
britain
to
make
contact
with
the
southern
government
an
effort
incautiously
entered
upon
and
from
which
an
attempt
to
withdraw
had
come
too
late
the
result
was
british
assertion
of
a
right
in
case
of
necessity
to
make
such
contact
having
recognized
the
south
as
a
belligerent
but
a
discontinuance
of
the
practice
under
the
american
protest
while
this
controversy
was
in
progress
the
attention
of
the
british
government
was
directed
to
a
proposal
urged
by
mercier
upon
lyons
in
washington
which
appeared
to
have
the
support
of
the
french
government
on
september
mercier
so
lyons
reported
had
received
a
private
letter
from
thouvenel
expressing
great
concern
over
the
prospective
scarcity
of
cotton
from
america
due
to
the
blockade
and
asking
mercier
advice
the
latter
now
informed
lyons
that
his
reply
had
outlined
the
following
steps
first
complete
harmony
of
action
between
england
and
france
second
recognition
of
southern
independence
third
refusal
longer
to
recognize
the
blockade
fourth
england
and
france
to
be
alert
to
seize
the
favourable
moment
when
the
north
became
disheartened
the
present
moment
not
being
a
good
one
this
policy
mercier
thought
so
bold
that
the
north
would
be
deterred
from
declaring
war
the
two
diplomats
held
long
argument
over
this
suggestion
lyons
acknowledged
the
general
pressure
for
cotton
but
thought
there
was
no
need
of
great
alarm
as
yet
and
also
advanced
the
idea
that
in
the
end
europe
would
benefit
by
being
forced
to
develop
other
sources
of
supply
thus
being
freed
from
such
exclusive
dependence
on
the
united
states
mercier
answered
that
france
was
in
dire
need
and
could
not
wait
and
he
urged
that
mere
recognition
of
the
south
would
not
secure
cotton
it
was
necessary
also
to
break
the
blockade
in
comment
to
russell
lyons
agreed
that
this
was
true
but
thought
the
fact
in
itself
an
argument
against
accepting
ideas
the
time
is
far
distant
when
the
intervention
of
england
and
france
in
the
quarrel
would
be
welcomed
or
unless
under
compulsion
tolerated
by
the
american
peoples
the
south
had
not
yet
gone
far
enough
in
establishing
its
independence
to
render
a
recognition
of
it
either
proper
or
desirable
for
european
powers
and
he
stated
with
emphasis
that
recognition
would
end
the
war
unless
there
was
also
an
with
the
south
in
the
british
cabinet
also
at
this
same
time
attention
was
being
directed
to
the
question
of
cotton
not
primarily
by
any
push
from
the
british
manufacturing
interest
but
because
of
queries
addressed
to
it
by
the
french
minister
in
london
russell
wrote
to
palmerston
referring
to
the
inquiry
of
flahault
i
agree
with
you
that
the
cotton
question
may
become
serious
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
he
added
that
lindsay
had
informed
him
that
in
any
case
cotton
could
not
be
brought
in
the
from
the
interior
to
the
southern
ports
in
truth
any
serious
thought
given
at
this
time
to
the
question
of
cotton
appears
to
be
the
result
of
the
french
arguments
at
london
and
washington
advocating
a
vigorous
american
policy
october
lyons
and
mercier
renewed
debate
on
exactly
the
same
lines
as
previously
mercier
this
time
reading
to
lyons
an
instruction
from
thouvenel
and
his
reply
lyons
insisted
that
the
north
would
most
certainly
declare
war
on
any
power
that
recognized
the
south
and
asserted
that
such
a
war
would
cause
more
suffering
many
times
than
all
the
suffering
now
caused
by
the
shortage
of
cotton
yet
lyons
felt
compelled
to
use
caution
and
conciliation
in
dealing
with
mercier
because
of
the
desire
to
preserve
close
harmony
of
attitude
a
few
clays
later
lyons
comments
seemed
wholly
justified
when
mercier
reported
to
him
the
tone
of
a
conversation
with
seward
after
having
left
with
him
a
copy
of
thouvenel
instruction
seward
said
plainly
that
the
united
states
would
go
to
war
with
any
foreign
power
that
tried
to
interfere
and
that
the
only
way
in
which
france
could
get
cotton
was
by
a
northern
conquest
of
the
south
he
acknowledged
that
the
united
states
might
be
defeated
but
he
informed
mercier
that
france
would
at
least
know
there
had
been
a
war
on
his
part
mercier
told
seward
that
in
his
opinion
there
was
but
one
possible
outcome
in
america
separation
and
that
he
had
advised
thouvenel
that
the
true
policy
of
england
and
france
was
to
recognize
the
south
and
bring
about
a
peaceful
separation
lyons
comment
to
russell
is
that
seward
had
certainly
taken
a
high
tone
evident
justification
of
lyons
previously
expressed
opinion
seward
had
been
very
eager
to
learn
whether
england
knew
of
thouvenel
instruction
to
which
mercier
replied
no
and
was
now
anxious
that
russell
should
not
reveal
to
adams
that
lyons
had
known
the
contents
before
delivery
to
seward
a
caution
with
which
lyons
was
very
content
lyons
first
report
of
mercier
ideas
had
been
received
in
london
at
a
rather
critical
moment
on
october
just
after
adams
complaint
about
bunch
and
russell
answer
while
waiting
to
see
whether
seward
would
magnify
that
incident
into
a
cause
of
rupture
and
four
days
before
bunch
unsatisfactory
explanation
had
been
received
russell
wrote
to
palmerston
there
is
much
good
sense
in
mercier
observations
but
we
must
wait
i
am
persuaded
that
if
we
do
anything
it
must
be
on
a
grand
scale
it
will
not
do
for
england
and
france
to
break
a
blockade
for
the
sake
of
getting
cotton
but
in
europe
powers
have
often
said
to
belligerents
make
up
your
quarrels
we
propose
to
give
terms
of
pacification
which
we
think
fair
and
equitable
if
you
accept
them
well
and
good
but
if
your
adversary
accepts
them
and
you
refuse
them
our
mediation
is
at
an
end
and
you
may
expect
to
see
us
your
enemies
france
would
be
quite
ready
to
hold
this
language
with
us
if
such
a
policy
were
to
be
adopted
the
time
for
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
year
or
immediately
before
the
meeting
of
parliament
apparently
russell
under
the
irritations
of
the
moment
was
somewhat
carried
away
by
mercier
suggestion
that
it
was
but
a
briefly
held
thought
has
been
shown
by
expressions
from
him
already
cited
nor
was
he
alone
in
ministerial
uncertainty
but
palmerston
was
not
inclined
to
alter
british
policy
october
he
replied
to
russell
as
to
north
america
our
best
and
true
policy
seems
to
be
to
go
on
as
we
have
begun
and
to
keep
quite
clear
of
the
conflict
between
north
and
south
the
only
excuse
for
intervention
would
be
the
danger
to
the
intervening
parties
if
the
conflict
went
on
but
in
the
american
case
this
can
not
be
pleaded
by
the
powers
of
europe
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
the
want
of
cotton
would
not
justify
such
a
proceeding
unless
indeed
the
distress
created
by
that
want
was
far
more
serious
than
it
is
likely
to
be
the
probability
is
that
some
cotton
will
find
its
way
to
us
from
america
and
that
we
shall
get
a
greater
supply
than
usual
from
other
quarters
the
only
thing
to
do
seems
to
be
to
lie
on
our
oars
and
to
give
no
pretext
to
the
washingtonians
to
quarrel
with
us
while
on
the
other
hand
we
maintain
our
rights
and
those
of
our
fellow
countrymen
in
washington
the
result
of
mercier
conversation
with
seward
outlining
thouvenel
suggestions
was
a
long
and
carefully
prepared
despatch
to
dayton
in
paris
which
the
biographer
of
seward
thinks
was
one
of
his
great
despatches
perhaps
it
was
his
greatest
if
we
consider
his
perfect
balance
and
the
diplomatic
way
in
which
he
seemed
to
ignore
what
was
menacing
while
he
adroitly
let
thouvenel
see
what
the
result
would
be
if
the
implied
threats
should
be
carried
out
seward
argued
with
skill
the
entire
matter
of
cotton
but
he
was
none
the
less
firm
in
diplomatic
defiance
of
foreign
intervention
since
great
britain
had
taken
no
part
in
the
french
scheme
a
point
which
seward
was
careful
to
make
clear
to
dayton
the
despatch
needs
no
expanded
treatment
here
its
significance
is
that
when
reported
to
lyons
by
mercier
for
seward
had
read
it
to
the
latter
the
british
minister
could
pride
himself
on
having
already
pointed
out
to
both
mercier
and
russell
that
seward
line
was
exactly
that
which
he
had
prophesied
mercier
again
was
very
anxious
that
his
confidences
to
lyons
should
not
become
known
and
lyons
was
glad
indeed
to
be
wholly
free
from
any
share
in
the
discussion
two
days
after
thus
describing
events
lyons
on
november
had
still
another
communication
and
apparently
a
last
on
this
topic
with
mercier
in
which
the
two
men
again
went
over
the
whole
ground
of
national
policy
toward
america
and
in
which
their
divergent
views
became
very
apparent
the
arguments
were
the
same
but
expressed
with
more
vigour
mercier
seems
indeed
to
have
attempted
to
rush
lyons
into
acquiescence
in
his
policy
lyons
finally
observed
to
him
that
he
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
her
majesty
government
considered
the
time
was
come
for
entertaining
at
all
the
question
of
recognizing
the
south
and
asked
what
good
such
a
step
would
do
anyway
mercier
replied
that
he
did
not
believe
that
the
north
would
declare
war
and
so
it
would
be
a
step
toward
settlement
to
this
lyons
took
positive
exception
lyons
report
of
this
conversation
was
written
on
november
a
date
which
was
soon
to
stand
out
as
that
on
which
occurred
an
event
more
immediately
threatening
to
relations
than
any
other
during
the
civil
war
the
battle
of
bull
run
had
left
on
british
minds
an
impression
of
northern
incapacity
in
war
even
a
doubt
of
northern
courage
and
determination
on
august
the
declaration
of
paris
negotiation
a
favourable
result
from
which
was
eagerly
desired
by
russell
had
failed
as
he
well
knew
when
he
attached
to
the
convention
that
explanatory
statement
limiting
its
action
in
point
of
time
in
the
end
russell
felt
that
britain
had
just
escaped
a
trap
two
weeks
after
this
russell
learned
of
the
arrest
of
mure
and
soon
of
the
demand
for
recall
finally
and
formally
made
by
adams
on
november
just
six
days
later
on
november
london
heard
of
the
affair
of
november
it
is
small
wonder
that
russell
and
his
colleagues
felt
an
increasing
uncertainty
as
to
the
intent
of
the
united
states
and
also
an
increasing
irritation
at
having
to
guard
their
steps
with
such
care
in
a
situation
where
they
sincerely
believed
the
only
possible
outcome
was
the
dissolution
of
the
american
union
but
up
to
the
moment
when
the
news
of
the
affair
was
received
they
had
pursued
a
policy
so
they
believed
of
strict
and
upright
neutrality
and
were
fixed
in
the
determination
not
to
permit
minor
controversies
or
economic
advantage
to
divert
them
from
it

were
james

appointment
indicated
that
the

had
at

awakened
to
the
need
of
a
serious
foreign
policy
it
was
publicly
and
widely
commented
on
by
the

thereby
arousing
an
excited
apprehension
in
the

almost
as
if
the
mere
sending
of
two
new
men
with
instructions
to
secure
recognition
abroad
were
tantamount
to
the
actual
accomplishment
of
their
object
mason
and
slidell
succeeded
in
running
the
blockade
at
charleston
on
the
night
of
october
on
the
confederate
steamer
and
arrived
at
new
providence
nassau
on
the
fourteenth
thence
proceeded
by
the
same
vessel
to
cardenas
cuba
and
from
that
point
journeyed
overland
to
havana
arriving
october
in
the
party
there
were
besides
the
two
envoys
their
secretaries
mcfarland

eustis

the

of
slidell
on

they
sailed
for

danish
island

the
vessel
on

they
left

were
laid

was
serious
enough
to
the
participants
in

the
envoys
especially
slidell
were
exultant
in
the
conviction
that
the
action
of
wilkes
would
inevitably
result
in
the
early
realization
of
the
object
of
their
journey
recognition
of
the
south
at

once

indeed
even
without

was

off

and
had
reached
thomas
on

a
few
days
later
when
off

of

he
had
learned
of

seizing

objections

the
result
was
that
quite
without

from

solely
upon
his
own
responsibility
a
challenge
was
addressed
to

by

than
brief
and
inaccurate
accounts
and
there
being
then
few

it
was
not
until
monday
the
eighteenth
that
there
broke
out
a
widespread
rejoicing

glorification
in
the
northern

america
for
a
few
days
passed
through
a
spasm
of
exultation
hard
to
understand
even
by
those
who
felt
it
once
the
first
emotion
had
subsided
this
had
various
causes
but
among
them
is
evident
a
quite
childish
fear
of
the
acuteness
and
abilities
of
mason
and
slidell
both
men
were
indeed
persons
of
distinction
in
the
politics
of
the
previous
decades
mason
had
always
been
open
in
his
expressed
antipathy
to
the
north
especially
to
new
england
had
long
been
a
leader
in
virginia
and
at
the
time
of
the
southern
secession
was
a
united
states
senator
from
that
state
slidell
a
northerner
by
birth
but
early
removed
to
louisiana
had
acquired
fortune
in
business
there
and
had
for
nearly
twenty
years
been
the
political
boss
of
one
faction
of
the
democratic
party
in
new
orleans
and
in
the
state
with
much
previous
experience
in
diplomacy
especially
that
requiring
intrigue
and
indirect
methods
as
in
the
preliminaries
of
the
mexican
war
and
having
held
his
seat
in
the
united
states
senate
until
the
withdrawal
of
louisiana
from
the
union
he
was
of
the
two
men
more
feared
and
more
detested
but
both
were
thoroughly
obnoxious
to
the
north
merely
on
the
personal
side
their
capture
was
cause
for
wide
rejoicing
surprise
was
also
an
element
in
the
american
elation
for
until
the
news
of
the
capture
was
received
no
portion
of
the
public
had
given
serious
thought
to
any
attempt
to
stop
the
envoys
surprise
also
played
its
part
when
the
affair
became
known
in

in

there
had

put
a
prize
crew
on
board
the
west
india
steamer
and
carry
her
off
to
a
port
of
the
united
states
in
other
words
what
would
be
the
right
of
the
american
cruiser
with
regard
to
her
passengers
and
crew
and
lawful
papers
and
correspondence
on
board
our
packet
on
the
assumption
that
the
said
packet
was
liable
to
capture
and
confiscation
on
the
ground
of
carrying
enemies
despatches
would
the
cruiser
be
entitled
to
carry
the
packet
and
all
and
everything
in
her
back
to
america
or
would
she
be
obliged
to
land
in
this
country
or
in
some
near
port
all
the
people
and
all
the
unseizable
goods
hammond
further
stated
that
russell
was
anxious
to
have
an
immediate
reply
inasmuch
as
the
mail
packet
was
due
to
arrive
in
southampton
on
november
the
opinion
of
the
law
officer
consulted
is
best
given
in
palmerston
own
words
in
a
letter
to
delane
editor
of
the
piccadilly
november
my
dear
delane
it
may
be
useful
to
you
to
know
that
the
chancellor
lushington
the
three
law
officers
sir
grey
the
duke
of
somerset
and
myself
met
at
the
treasury
to
consider
what
we
could
properly
do
about
the
american
cruiser
come
no
doubt
to
search
the
west
indian
packet
supposed
to
be
bringing
hither
the
two
southern
envoys
and
much
to
my
regret
it
appeared
that
according
to
the
principles
of
international
law
laid
down
in
our
courts
by
lord
stowell
and
practised
and
enforced
by
us
a
belligerent
has
a
right
to
stop
and
search
any
neutral
not
being
a
ship
of
war
and
being
found
on
the
high
seas
and
being
suspected
of
carrying
enemy
despatches
and
that
consequently
this
american
cruiser
might
by
our
own
principles
of
international
law
stop
the
west
indian
packet
search
her
and
if
the
southern
men
and
their
despatches
and
credentials
were
found
on
board
either
take
them
out
or
seize
the
packet
and
carry
her
back
to
new
york
for
trial
such
being
the
opinion
of
our
men
learned
in
the
law
we
have
determined
to
do
no
more
than
to
order
the
frigate
to
drop
down
to
yarmouth
roads
and
watch
the
proceedings
of
the
american
within
our
limit
of
territorial
jurisdiction
and
to
prevent
her
from
exercising
within
that
limit
those
rights
which
we
can
not
dispute
as
belonging
to
her
beyond
that
limit
in
the
meanwhile
the
american
captain
having
got
very
drunk
this
morning
at
southampton
with
some
excellent
brandy
and
finding
it
blow
heavily
at
sea
has
come
to
an
anchor
for
the
night
within
calshot
castle
at
the
entrance
of
the
southampton
river
i
mention
these
things
for
your
private
information
yours
sincerely
palmerston
not
completely
satisfied
with
this
decision
as
reported
to
delane
and
sincerely
anxious
to
avert
what
he
foresaw
would
be
a
difficult
situation
palmerston
took
the
unusual
step
of
writing
to
adams
on
the
next
day
november
and
asking
for
an
interview
his
note
took
adams
by
surprise
but
he
promptly
waited
upon
palmerston
and
was
told
of
the
latter
disturbance
at
the
presence
of
the
american
ship
captain
marchand
commanding
in
southampton
harbour
with
the
alleged
purpose
of
stopping
the
british
west
india
steamer
and
intercepting
the
journey
of
mason
and
slidell
palmerston
stated
that
he
did
not
pretend
to
judge
absolutely
of
the
question
whether
we
had
a
right
to
stop
a
foreign
vessel
for
such
a
purpose
as
was
indicated
and
he
urged
on
adams
the
unwisdom
of
such
an
act
in
any
case
neither
did
the
object
to
be
gained
seem
commensurate
with
the
risk
for
it
was
surely
of
no
consequence
whether
one
or
two
more
men
were
added
to
the
two
or
three
who
had
already
been
so
long
here
they
would
scarcely
make
a
difference
in
the
action
of
the
government
after
once
having
made
up
its
mind
the
interview
with
adams
so
palmerston
wrote
to
delane
on
the
same
day
november
was
reassuring
my
dear
delane
i
have
seen
adams
and
he
assures
me
that
the
american
was
sent
to
intercept
the
if
found
in
these
seas
but
not
to
meddle
with
any
ship
under
a
foreign
flag
he
said
he
had
seen
the
commander
and
had
advised
him
to
go
straight
home
and
he
believed
the
steamer
to
be
now
on
her
way
back
to
the
united
states
this
is
a
very
satisfactory
explanation
yours
sincerely
palmerston
in
fact
neither
adams
diary
nor
his
report
to
seward
recorded
quite
the
same
statement
as
that
here
attributed
to
him
by
palmerston
and
this
became
later
but
fortunately
after
the
question
of
the
had
passed
off
the
stage
a
matter
of
minor
dispute
adams
own
statement
was
that
he
had
told
palmerston
the
was
seeking
to
intercept
the
and
had
no
instruction
to
interfere
with
a
british
packet
which
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
she
already
had
instructions
not
to
meddle
with
any
ship
under
a
foreign
flag
but
in
any
case
it
would
appear
that
the
british
government
had
been
warned
by
its
legal
advisers
that
if
that
which
actually
happened
in
the
case
of
the
should
occur
english
practice
if
followed
would
compel
acquiescence
in
it
this
is
not
to
say
that
a
first
legal
advice
thus
given
on
a
problematical
case
necessarily
bound
the
government
to
a
fixed
line
of
action
but
that
the
opinion
of
the
government
was
one
of
no
help
for
it
if
the
case
should
actually
arise
is
shown
by
the
instructions
to
lyons
and
by
his
reaction
on
november
hammond
wrote
to
lyons
stating
the
opinion
of
the
law
officers
that
we
could
do
nothing
to
save
the
packet
being
interfered
with
outside
our
three
miles
so
lord
palmerston
sent
for
adams
who
assured
him
that
the
american
the
had
no
instructions
to
meddle
with
any
ship
under
english
colours
that
her
orders
were
not
to
endeavour
to
take
mason
and
slidell
out
of
any
ship
under
foreign
colours
on
receipt
of
this
letter
subsequent
to
the
actual
seizure
of
the
envoys
lyons
hardly
knew
what
to
expect
he
reported
hammond
account
to
admiral
milne
writing
that
the
legal
opinion
was
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
save
the
packet
being
interfered
with
outside
of
the
marine
league
from
the
british
coast
but
he
added
i
am
not
informed
that
the
law
officers
decided
that
mason
and
slidell
might
be
taken
out
of
the
packet
but
only
that
we
could
not
prevent
the
packet
being
interfered
with
thus
previsioning
that
shift
in
british
legal
opinion
which
was
to
come
the
event
meanwhile
lyons
was
so
uncertain
as
to
what
his
instructions
would
be
that
he
thought
he
ought
to
maintain
the
greatest
reserve
here
on
the
matter
of
the
this
british
anxiety
and
the
efforts
to
prevent
a
dangerous
complication
occurred
after
the
envoys
had
been
seized
but
some
two
weeks
before
that
fact
was
known
in
london
adams
wrote
russell
says
it
was
all
a
false
alarm
and
wonders
at
our
susceptibility
and
exaggerated
notions
but
russell
was
not
equally
convinced
with
adams
that
the
north
especially
seward
was
so
eager
for
continued
british
neutrality
and
when
on
november
the
news
of
captain
wilkes
action
was
received
russell
and
many
others
in
the
cabinet
saw
in
it
a
continuation
of
unfriendly
northern
policy
now
culminating
in
a
direct
affront
argyll
the
most
avowed
friend
of
the
north
in
the
cabinet
was
stirred
at
first
to
keen
resentment
writing
of
this
wretched
piece
of
american
folly
i
am
all
against
submitting
to
any
clean
breach
of
international
law
such
as
i
can
hardly
doubt
this
has
been
the
law
officers
now
held
that
captain
wilkes
had
undertaken
to
pass
upon
the
issue
of
a
violation
of
neutrality
on
the
spot
instead
of
sending
the
as
a
prize
into
port
for
judicial
adjudication
this
was
still
later
further
expanded
by
an
opinion
that
the
envoys
could
not
be
considered
as
contraband
and
thus
subject
to
capture
nor
the
as
having
violated
neutrality
since
the
destination
of
the
vessel
was
to
a
neutral
not
to
an
enemy
port
this
opinion
would
have
prohibited
even
the
carrying
of
the
into
an
american
port
for
trial
by
a
prize
court
but
the
british
government
did
not
argue
the
matter
in
its
demand
upon
the
united
states
the
case
was
one
for
a
quick
demand
of
prompt
reparation
russell
instruction
to
lyons
sent
on
november
was
couched
in
coldly
correct
language
showing
neither
a
friendly
nor
an
unfriendly
attitude
the
seizure
of
the
envoys
was
asserted
to
be
a
breach
of
international
law
which
it
was
hoped
had
occurred
without
orders
and
lyons
was
to
demand
the
restoration
of
the
prisoners
with
an
apology
if
seward
had
not
already
offered
these
terms
lyons
was
to
propose
them
but
as
a
preliminary
step
in
making
clear
the
british
position
he
might
read
the
instruction
to
seward
leaving
him
a
copy
of
it
if
desired
in
another
instruction
of
the
same
date
russell
authorized
a
delay
of
seven
days
in
insisting
upon
an
answer
by
seward
if
the
latter
wished
it
and
gave
lyons
liberty
to
determine
whether
the
requirements
of
her
majesty
government
are
substantially
complied
with
and
on
december
russell
writing
privately
to
lyons
instructed
him
while
upholding
english
dignity
to
abstain
from
anything
like
menace
on
november
also
the
government
hurriedly
sent
out
orders
to
hold
the
british
fleet
in
readiness
began
preparations
for
the
sending
of
troops
to
canada
and
initiated
munitions
and
supply
activities
evidently
there
was
at
first
but
faint
hope
that
a
break
in
relations
soon
to
be
followed
by
war
was
to
be
avoided
it
has
long
been
known
to
history
and
was
known
to
adams
almost
immediately
that
the
first
draft
of
the
instruction
to
lyons
was
softened
in
language
by
the
advice
of
prince
albert
the
material
point
being
the
expression
of
a
hope
that
the
action
of
captain
wilkes
was
unauthorized
that
instruction
had
been
sent
previous
to
the
receipt
of
a
report
from
lyons
in
which
very
fearful
of
results
he
stated
that
waiting
instructions
he
would
preserve
a
strict
silence
equally
anxious
was
cowley
at
paris
who
feared
the
realization
of
seward
former
foreign
war
panacea
i
wish
i
could
divest
myself
of
the
idea
that
the
north
and
south
will
not
shake
hands
over
a
war
with
us
considering
the
bitterness
of
the
quarrel
in
america
this
was
a
notion
the
efforts
promptly
made
by
the
confederate
agents
in
london
to
make
use
of
the
affair
showed
how
little
cowley
understood
the
american
temper
having
remained
very
quiet
since
august
when
russell
had
informed
them
that
great
britain
intended
remaining
strictly
neutral
they
now
on
november
and
renewed
their
argument
and
application
for
recognition
but
received
in
reply
a
curt
letter
declining
any
official
communication
with
them
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
the
delay
of
at
least
three
weeks
imposed
by
methods
of
transportation
before
even
the
first
american
reaction
to
the
british
demand
could
be
received
in
london
gave
time
for
a
lessening
of
excitement
and
a
more
careful
by
british
statesmen
as
to
what
they
really
felt
and
desired
gladstone
wrote
it
is
a
very
sad
and
business
and
i
sincerely
trust
with
you
that
war
may
be
averted
argyll
hurried
home
from
the
continent
being
much
disturbed
by
the
tone
of
the
british
press
and
stating
that
he
was
against
standing
on
technical
grounds
of
international
law
war
with
america
is
such
a
calamity
that
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
avoid
it
it
involves
not
only
ourselves
but
all
our
north
american
colonies
but
war
seemed
to
both
men
scarcely
avoidable
an
opinion
held
also
by
cornewall
lewis
and
by
clarendon
the
latter
standing
at
the
moment
in
a
position
midway
between
the
whig
and
tory
parties
yet
russell
with
more
cause
than
others
to
mistrust
seward
policy
as
also
believing
that
he
had
more
cause
personally
to
resent
it
was
less
pessimistic
and
was
already
thinking
of
at
least
postponing
immediate
hostilities
in
the
event
of
an
american
refusal
to
make
just
recompense
on
december
he
wrote
to
palmerston
i
incline
more
and
more
to
the
opinion
that
if
the
answer
is
a
reasoning
and
not
a
blunt
offensive
answer
we
should
send
once
more
across
the
atlantic
to
ask
compliance
i
do
not
think
the
country
would
approve
an
immediate
declaration
of
war
but
i
think
we
must
abide
by
our
demand
of
a
restoration
of
the
prisoners
lyons
gives
a
sad
account
of
canada
your
foresight
of
last
year
is
amply
justified
and
on
december
he
wrote
adams
language
yesterday
was
entirely
in
favour
of
yielding
to
us
if
our
tone
is
not
too
peremptory
if
our
demands
are
refused
we
must
of
course
call
parliament
together
the
sixth
of
february
will
do
in
any
other
case
we
must
decide
according
to
circumstances
thus
russell
would
not
have
great
britain
go
to
war
with
america
without
the
sanction
of
parliament
and
was
seeking
reasons
for
delay
he
was
reacting
in
fact
to
a
more
sobering
second
thought
which
was
experienced
also
by
nearly
everyone
save
the
eager
british
southerner
in
public
and
in
newspaper
circles
the
first
explosion
of
the
press
on
receipt
of
the
news
of
the
had
been
a
terrific
one
the
british
lion
insulted
in
its
chosen
field
of
supremacy
the
sea
had
pawed
the
air
in
frenzy
though
at
first
preserving
a
certain
slow
dignity
of
motion
customary
strong
became
vigorous
indeed
in
editorial
treatment
of
america
and
in
demand
for
the
prompt
release
of
the
envoys
with
suitable
apology
the
close
touch
of
leading
papers
with
governmental
opinion
is
well
shown
as
in
the
by
the
editorials
of
the
first
week
on
november
there
was
solemn
and
anxious
consideration
of
a
grave
crisis
with
much
questioning
of
international
law
which
was
acknowledged
to
be
doubtful
but
even
if
old
british
practice
seemed
to
support
captain
wilkes
the
present
was
not
to
be
controlled
by
a
discarded
past
and
essential
differences
were
pointed
out
this
tone
of
vexed
uncertainty
changed
to
a
note
of
positive
assurance
and
militant
patriotism
on
november
when
the
government
made
its
demand
the
up
to
december
thought
it
absolutely
certain
that
wilkes
had
acted
on
authorization
and
devoted
much
space
to
seward
as
the
evil
genius
of
american
warlike
policy
toward
england
the
old
duke
of
newcastle
story
was
revamped
but
on
december
there
reached
london
the
first
very
brief
american
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
at
fortress
monroe
and
this
contained
a
positive
statement
by
wilkes
that
he
had
had
no
orders
the
was
sceptical
but
printed
the
news
as
having
an
important
bearing
if
true
and
at
the
same
time
printed
communications
by
justicia
and
others
advising
a
go
slowly
policy
yet
all
british
papers
indulged
in
sharp
reflections
on
american
insults
displayed
keen
resentment
and
demanded
a
prompt
yielding
to
the
governmental
demand
an
intelligent
american
long
resident
in
london
wrote
to
seward
on
november
there
never
was
within
memory
such
a
burst
of
feeling
as
has
been
created
by
the
news
of
the
boarding
of
the
trent
the
people
are
frantic
with
rage
and
were
the
country
polled
i
fear
men
out
of
a
thousand
would
declare
for
immediate
war
lord
palmerston
can
not
resist
the
impulse
if
he
would
and
another
american
in
edinburgh
wrote
to
his
uncle
in
new
york
i
have
never
seen
so
intense
a
feeling
of
indignation
exhibited
in
my
life
it
pervades
all
classes
and
may
make
itself
heard
above
the
wiser
theories
of
the
cabinet
officers
if
such
were
the
british
temper
it
would
require
skilful
handling
by
even
a
government
to
avoid
war
even
without
belligerent
newspaper
utterances
the
tone
of
arrogance
as
in
cartoon
you
do
what
right
my
son
or
i
blow
you
out
of
the
water
portended
no
happy
solution
yet
this
cartoon
at
least
implied
a
hope
of
peaceful
outcome
and
that
this
was
soon
a
general
hope
is
shown
by
the
prompt
publicity
given
to
a
statement
from
the
american
general
winfield
scott
in
paris
denying
that
he
had
said
the
action
of
captain
wilkes
had
been
decided
upon
at
washington
before
he
sailed
for
europe
and
asserting
that
no
orders
were
given
to
seize
the
envoys
on
board
any
british
or
foreign
vessel
nevertheless
adams
for
the
moment
intensely
aroused
and
suspicious
of
the
whole
purpose
of
british
policy
could
write
to
his
friend
dana
in
boston
the
expression
of
the
past
summer
might
have
convinced
you
that
she
great
britain
was
not
indifferent
to
the
disruption
of
the
union
in
may
she
drove
in
the
tip
of
the
wedge
and
now
you
ca
imagine
that
a
few
spiders
webs
of
a
half
a
century
back
will
not
be
strong
enough
to
hold
her
from
driving
it
home
little
do
you
understand
of
this
isle
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
one
cause
of
a
more
bitter
and
sharper
tone
in
the
british
press
was
the
reception
of
the
of
the
american
press
on
learning
of
the
detention
and
the
exercise
of
right
of
search
on
a
british
ship
the
american
public
equally
went
off
its
head
in
its
expressions
writing
in
the
son
of
the
american
minister
to
great
britain
charles
francis
adams
in
a
young
in
boston
stated
i
do
not
remember
in
the
whole
course
of
the
retrospect
any
occurrence
in
which
the
american
people
were
so
completely
swept
off
their
feet
for
the
moment
losing
possession
of
their
senses
as
during
the
weeks
which
immediately
followed
the
seizure
of
mason
and
slidell
there
were
evident
two
principal
causes
for
this
elation
the
north
with
much
emotion
and
high
courage
entering
in
april
upon
the
task
of
restoring
the
union
and
hoping
for
quick
success
had
now
passed
through
a
wearisome
six
months
with
no
evident
progress
towards
its
object
northern
failure
had
developed
a
deep
mortification
when
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
a
bold
naval
captain
on
his
own
initiative
appeared
to
have
struck
a
real
blow
at
the
south
his
action
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
fighting
forces
of
the
north
if
free
from
the
trammels
of
washington
red
tape
could
and
would
carry
on
energetic
war
certainly
it
was
but
a
slight
incident
to
create
such
northern
emotion
yet
the
result
was
a
sudden
lifting
from
despondency
to
elation
but
almost
equally
with
this
cause
of
joy
there
operated
on
american
minds
the
notion
that
the
united
states
had
at
last
given
to
great
britain
a
dose
of
her
own
medicine
in
a
previous
era
had
exercised
upon
a
british
ship
that
right
of
search
which
had
been
so
keenly
resented
by
america
as
to
have
become
almost
a
cause
of
a
sense
of
injury
once
received
and
never
to
be
forgotten
there
was
no
clear
thinking
about
this
the
obnoxious
right
of
search
in
times
of
peace
for
vagrant
seamen
the
belligerent
right
exercised
by
britain
while
america
was
a
neutral
the
practice
of
a
right
of
visit
claimed
by
britain
as
necessary
in
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
all
were
confused
by
the
american
public
as
they
are
still
in
many
history
textbooks
to
this
day
and
the
total
result
of
this
mixing
of
ideas
was
a
general
american
jubilation
that
the
united
states
had
now
revenged
herself
for
british
offences
in
a
manner
of
which
great
britain
could
not
consistently
complain
these
two
main
reasons
for
exultation
were
shared
by
all
classes
not
merely
by
the
uninformed
mob
of
newspaper
readers
at
a
banquet
tendered
captain
wilkes
in
boston
on
november
governor
andrews
of
massachusetts
called
wilkes
action
one
of
the
most
illustrious
services
that
had
made
the
war
memorable
and
added
that
there
might
be
nothing
left
in
the
episode
to
crown
the
exultation
of
the
american
heart
commodore
wilkes
fired
his
shot
across
the
bows
of
the
ship
that
bore
the
british
lion
at
its
head
all
america
first
applauded
the
act
then
plunged
into
discussion
of
its
legality
as
doubts
began
to
arise
of
its
defensibility
and
wisdom
it
became
a
sort
of
temporarily
popular
parlour
game
to
argue
the
international
law
of
the
case
and
decide
that
great
britain
could
have
no
cause
of
complaint
meanwhile
at
washington
itself
there
was
evidenced
almost
equal
excitement
and
approval
but
not
fortunately
by
the
department
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations
secretary
of
the
navy
welles
congratulated
wilkes
on
his
great
public
service
though
criticizing
him
for
not
having
brought
the
into
port
for
adjudication
congress
passed
a
joint
resolution
december
thanking
wilkes
for
his
conduct
and
the
president
was
requested
to
give
him
a
gold
medal
commemorative
of
his
act
indeed
no
evidence
of
approbation
was
withheld
save
the
formal
approval
and
avowal
of
national
responsibility
by
the
secretary
of
state
seward
on
him
therefore
and
on
the
wisdom
of
men
high
in
the
confidence
of
the
cabinet
like
sumner
lyons
pinned
his
faint
hope
of
a
peaceful
solution
thoroughly
alarmed
and
despondent
anxious
as
to
the
possible
fate
of
canada
he
advised
against
any
public
preparations
in
canada
for
defence
on
the
ground
that
if
the
affair
did
blow
over
it
should
not
appear
that
we
ever
thought
it
an
insult
which
would
endanger
peace
this
was
very
different
from
the
action
and
attitude
of
the
government
at
home
as
yet
unknown
to
lyons
he
wisely
waited
in
silence
advising
like
caution
to
others
until
the
receipt
of
instructions
silence
at
the
moment
was
also
a
friendly
service
to
the
united
states
the
earliest
american
reactions
the
national
rejoicing
became
known
to
the
british
press
some
six
days
after
its
own
spasm
of
anger
and
three
days
after
the
government
had
despatched
its
demand
for
release
of
the
prisoners
and
begun
its
hurried
military
preparations
on
december
the
contained
the
first
summary
of
american
press
outpourings
the
first
effect
in
england
was
astonishment
followed
by
renewed
and
more
intense
evidences
of
a
belligerent
disposition
soon
however
there
began
to
appear
a
note
of
caution
and
more
sane
judgment
of
the
situation
though
with
no
lessening
of
the
assertion
that
britain
had
suffered
an
injury
that
must
be
redressed
the
american
frenzy
of
delight
seemingly
indicated
a
hostility
to
britain
that
gave
pause
to
british
clamour
for
revenge
on
december
john
bright
made
a
great
speech
at
rochdale
arguing
a
possible
british
precedent
for
wilkes
act
urging
caution
lauding
american
leadership
in
democracy
and
stating
his
positive
conviction
that
the
united
states
government
was
as
much
astonished
as
was
that
of
great
britain
by
the
attack
on
the
to
this
the
gave
a
full
column
of
report
on
december
and
the
day
following
printed
five
columns
of
the
speech
itself
editorially
it
attacked
bright
position
belittling
the
speech
for
having
been
made
at
the
one
inconspicuous
place
where
the
orator
would
be
sure
of
a
warm
welcome
and
asking
why
manchester
or
liverpool
had
not
been
chosen
in
fact
however
the
was
attempting
to
controvert
our
ancient
enemy
bright
as
an
apostle
of
democracy
rather
than
to
fan
the
flames
of
irritation
over
the
and
the
prominence
given
to
bright
speech
indicates
a
greater
readiness
to
consider
as
hopeful
an
escape
from
the
existing
crisis
after
december
and
up
to
the
ninth
the
was
more
caustic
about
america
than
previously
the
impression
of
its
editorials
read
is
that
more
hopeful
of
a
peaceful
solution
it
was
more
free
to
snarl
but
with
the
issue
of
december
there
began
a
series
of
leaders
and
communications
though
occasionally
with
a
relapse
to
the
former
tone
distinctly
less
irritating
to
americans
and
indicating
a
real
desire
for
peace
other
newspapers
either
followed
the
or
were
slightly
in
advance
of
it
in
a
change
to
more
considerate
and
peaceful
expressions
adams
could
write
to
seward
on
december
that
he
saw
no
change
in
the
universality
of
the
british
demand
for
satisfaction
of
the
insult
and
injury
thought
to
be
endured
but
he
recognized
in
the
next
few
days
that
a
slow
shift
was
taking
place
in
the
british
temper
and
regretted
the
violence
of
american
utterances
december
he
wrote
to
his
son
in
america
it
has
given
us
here
an
indescribably
sad
feeling
to
witness
the
exultation
in
america
over
an
event
which
bids
fair
to
be
the
final
calamity
in
this
contest
great
britain
is
right
in
principle
and
only
wrong
in
point
of
consistency
our
mistake
is
that
we
are
donning
ourselves
in
her
suit
when
our
own
is
better
worth
wearing
his
secretarial
son
was
more
vehement
angry
and
hateful
as
i
am
of
great
britain
i
still
ca
help
laughing
and
cursing
at
the
same
time
as
i
see
the
accounts
of
the
talk
of
our
people
what
a
bloody
set
of
fools
they
are
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
conceivable
could
you
suppose
that
england
would
sit
quiet
under
such
an
insult
should
have
jumped
out
of
our
boots
at
such
a
one
the
british
cabinet
members
were
divided
in
sentiments
of
hope
or
pessimism
as
to
the
outcome
and
were
increasingly
anxious
for
an
honourable
escape
from
a
possible
situation
in
which
if
they
trusted
the
observations
of
lyons
they
might
find
themselves
aiding
a
slave
as
against
a
free
state
on
november
lyons
had
written
a
long
account
of
the
changes
taking
place
in
northern
feeling
as
regards
slavery
he
thought
it
very
probable
that
the
issue
of
emancipation
would
soon
be
forced
upon
lincoln
and
that
the
american
conflict
would
then
take
on
a
new
and
more
ideal
character
this
letter
arriving
in
the
midst
of
uncertainty
about
the
solution
was
in
line
with
news
published
in
the
british
papers
calling
out
editorials
from
them
largely
in
disapproval
certainly
russell
was
averse
to
war
if
the
prisoners
were
not
given
up
what
he
asked
ought
england
then
to
do
would
it
be
wise
to
delay
hostilities
or
to
begin
them
at
once
an
early
resort
to
hostilities
will
enable
us
at
once
to
raise
the
blockade
of
the
south
to
blockade
the
north
and
to
prevent
the
egress
of
numerous
ships
commissioned
as
privateers
which
will
be
sent
against
our
commerce
but
then
there
was
canada
at
present
not
defensible
he
had
been
reading
alison
on
the
war
of
and
found
that
then
the
american
army
of
invasion
had
numbered
but
men
we
may
now
expect
or
two
days
later
he
wrote
to
gladstone
that
if
america
would
only
let
the
commissioners
free
to
go
where
they
pleased
he
would
be
satisfied
he
added
that
in
that
case
i
should
be
very
glad
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
giving
up
our
pretensions
of
and
securing
immunity
to
persons
not
in
arms
on
board
neutral
vessels
or
to
persons
going
bona
fide
from
one
neutral
port
to
another
this
would
be
a
triumph
to
the
in
principle
while
the
particular
case
would
be
decided
in
our
favour
on
saturday
december
the
prince
consort
died
it
was
that
he
had
long
been
a
brake
upon
the
wheel
of
palmerston
foreign
policy
and
to
the
initiated
his
last
effort
in
this
direction
the
modification
of
the
instruction
to
lyons
on
the
was
no
secret
there
is
no
evidence
that
his
death
made
any
change
in
the
british
position
but
it
was
true
as
the
american
minister
wrote
that
now
they
the
british
public
are
beginning
to
open
their
eyes
to
a
sense
of
his
value
they
discover
that
much
of
their
political
quietude
has
been
due
to
the
judicious
exercise
of
his
influence
over
the
queen
and
the
court
and
they
do
not
conceal
their
uneasiness
as
to
the
future
without
him
the
nation
was
plunged
into
deep
mourning
but
not
to
distraction
from
the
american
crisis
for
on
the
day
when
all
papers
were
black
with
mourning
borders
december
they
printed
the
news
of
the
approval
of
wilkes
by
the
united
states
congress
and
gave
a
summary
of
lincoln
message
of
december
which
to
their
astonishment
made
no
mention
of
the
affair
the
congressional
approval
caused
almost
a
feeling
of
consternation
among
ourselves
but
silence
it
was
argued
might
possibly
be
taken
as
a
good
omen
since
it
might
indicate
that
he
had
as
yet
reached
no
decision
evidently
there
was
more
real
alarm
caused
by
the
applause
given
wilkes
by
one
branch
of
the
government
than
by
the
outpourings
of
the
american
press
the
next
day
several
papers
printed
lincoln
message
in
full
and
the
gave
a
long
editorial
analysis
showing
much
spleen
that
he
had
ignored
the
issue
with
great
britain
on
the
eighteenth
this
journal
also
called
attention
in
a
column
and
a
half
editorial
to
the
report
of
the
american
secretary
of
war
expressing
astonishment
not
unmixed
with
anxiety
at
the
energy
which
had
resulted
in
the
increase
of
the
army
to
men
in
less
than
nine
months
the
continued
even
increased
its
vigour
of
utterance
on
the
but
devoted
most
of
its
energy
to
combating
the
suggestions
now
being
made
very
generally
advocating
a
recourse
to
arbitration
this
would
be
weak
concession
and
less
likely
to
secure
redress
and
peace
for
the
future
than
an
insistence
on
the
original
demands
statesmen
also
were
puzzled
by
lincoln
silence
milner
gibson
wrote
that
even
though
lyons
should
come
away
i
think
the
dispute
may
after
all
be
settled
without
war
cornewall
lewis
thought
the
last
mail
from
america
is
decidedly
threatening
not
encouraging
but
on
december
adams
was
at
last
able
to
give
russell
official
assurance
that
wilkes
had
acted
without
authorization
russell
at
once
informed
lyons
of
this
communication
and
that
he
had
now
told
adams
the
exact
terms
of
his
two
instructions
to
lyons
of
november
he
instructed
lyons
to
accept
in
place
of
an
apology
an
explanation
that
action
was
unauthorized
a
very
important
further
british
modification
but
one
which
did
not
reach
lyons
until
after
the
conclusion
of
the
affair
at
washington
meanwhile
a
notable
change
had
taken
place
in
american
public
expressions
it
now
regarded
the
wilkes
affair
unfavourably
and
would
much
prefer
it
had
not
occurred
at
all
a
reaction
without
question
almost
wholly
caused
by
the
knowledge
of
the
british
demand
and
the
unanimous
support
given
it
by
the
british
public
on
great
britain
the
alteration
in
the
american
tone
produced
less
effect
than
might
have
been
expected
and
this
because
of
the
persistent
fear
and
suspicion
of
seward
his
voice
it
was
felt
would
in
the
end
be
the
determining
one
and
if
british
belief
that
he
had
long
sought
an
occasion
for
war
was
correct
this
surely
was
the
time
when
he
could
be
confident
of
popular
support
thurlow
weed
seward
most
intimate
political
adviser
was
now
in
london
and
attempted
to
disabuse
the
british
public
through
the
columns
of
the
his
communication
was
printed
but
his
assertion
that
unfriendly
utterances
beginning
with
the
newcastle
story
were
misunderstood
did
not
convince
the
which
answered
him
at
length
and
asserted
its
belief
that
upon
his
ability
to
involve
the
united
states
in
a
war
with
england
seward
has
staked
his
official
and
most
probably
also
his
political
existence
the
duke
of
newcastle
report
of
seward
remarks
wrote
george
peabody
later
has
strongly
influenced
the
government
in
war
preparations
for
several
months
past
adams
himself
though
convinced
that
supposed
animosity
was
a
mistake
founded
on
a
bad
joke
of
his
to
the
duke
of
newcastle
acknowledged
that
the
duke
has
however
succeeded
in
making
everybody
in
authority
here
believe
it
surely
no
joke
to
an
englishman
ever
so
plagued
an
american
statesman
but
british
ministers
founded
their
suspicions
on
far
more
serious
reasons
as
previously
related
as
time
passed
without
an
answer
from
america
british
speculation
turned
to
estimates
of
the
probable
conditions
of
a
war
these
were
not
reassuring
since
even
though
postulating
a
british
victory
it
appeared
inevitable
that
england
would
not
escape
without
considerable
damage
from
the
american
navy
and
from
privateers
americans
were
a
powerful
and
adventurous
people
strong
in
maritime
resources
and
participating
in
our
own
national
familiarity
with
the
risks
and
dangers
of
the
deep
englishmen
must
not
think
that
a
war
would
be
fought
only
on
the
shores
of
america
and
in
canada
the
legal
question
was
and
intelligent
american
vexation
in
three
letters
printed
in
the
on
december
and
by
story
an
artist
resident
in
rome
but
known
in
england
as
the
son
of
justice
story
whose
fame
as
a
jurist
stood
high
in
great
britain
by
the
last
week
of
the
year
adams
felt
that
the
ministry
at
least
was
eager
to
find
a
way
out
the
government
here
will
not
press
the
thing
to
an
extreme
unless
they
are
driven
to
it
by
the
impetus
of
the
wave
they
have
themselves
created
he
greatly
regretted
the
death
of
the
prince
consort
who
believed
in
the
policy
of
conciliating
the
united
states
instead
of
repelling
them
on
december
adams
wrote
seward
i
think
the
signs
are
clear
of
a
considerable
degree
of
reaction
he
also
explained
the
causes
of
the
nearly
unanimous
european
support
of
england
in
this
contention
unquestionably
the
view
of
all
other
countries
is
that
the
opportunity
is
most
fortunate
for
obtaining
new
and
large
modifications
of
international
law
which
will
hereafter
materially
restrain
the
proverbial
tendency
of
this
country
on
the
ocean
adams
estimate
was
correct
even
the
generally
accepted
as
palmerston
organ
and
in
the
crisis
the
most
of
all
metropolitan
journals
commented
upon
the
general
public
hope
of
a
peaceful
solution
but
asked
on
december
can
a
government
the
american
elected
but
a
few
months
since
by
the
popular
choice
depending
exclusively
for
existence
on
popular
support
afford
to
disappoint
the
popular
expectation
the
answer
to
this
question
must
we
fear
be
in
the
negative
the
thereby
palmerston
did
indeed
as
later
charged
prolong
the
excitement
but
not
with
its
earlier
animosity
to
america
the
very
fact
that
the
was
accepted
as
palmerston
organ
justified
this
attitude
for
it
would
have
been
folly
for
the
government
to
announce
prematurely
a
result
of
which
there
was
as
yet
no
definite
assurance
yet
the
cabinet
there
was
a
more
hopeful
feeling
argyll
believed
adams
statement
to
russell
of
december
was
practically
conclusive
and
adams
himself
now
thought
that
the
prevalent
idea
was
waning
of
an
american
plan
to
inflict
persistent
indignities
on
britain
at
least
in
this
case
nothing
of
the
kind
had
been
intended
everyone
wondered
at
and
was
vexed
with
the
delay
of
an
answer
from
america
yet
hopefully
believed
that
this
indicated
ultimate
yielding
there
could
be
no
surety
until
the
event
russell
wrote
to
palmerston
on
january
i
still
incline
to
think
lincoln
will
submit
but
not
until
the
clock
is
minutes
past
if
it
is
war
i
fear
we
must
summon
parliament
forthwith
the
last
moment
for
reply
was
indeed
very
nearly
taken
advantage
of
at
washington
but
not
to
the
full
seven
days
permitted
for
consideration
by
russell
november
thirtieth
instructions
to
lyons
these
were
received
on
december
and
on
the
next
day
lyons
unofficially
acquainted
seward
with
their
nature
the
latter
expressed
gratification
with
the
friendly
and
conciliatory
manner
of
lyons
and
asked
for
two
days
time
for
consideration
on
saturday
december
therefore
lyons
again
appeared
to
make
a
formal
presentation
of
demands
but
was
met
with
a
statement
that
the
press
of
other
business
had
prevented
sufficient
consideration
and
was
asked
for
a
further
two
postponement
until
monday
hence
december
became
the
day
from
which
the
seven
days
permitted
for
consideration
and
reply
dated
in
the
meantime
mercier
on
december
had
told
seward
of
the
strong
support
given
by
france
to
the
british
position
the
month
that
had
elapsed
since
the
american
outburst
on
first
learning
of
wilkes
act
had
given
time
for
a
cooling
of
patriotic
fever
and
for
a
saner
judgment
henry
adams
in
london
had
written
to
his
brother
that
if
the
prisoners
were
not
given
up
this
nation
means
to
make
war
to
this
the
brother
in
america
replied
this
nation
does
an
answer
that
sums
up
public
determination
no
matter
how
loud
the
talk
or
deep
the
feeling
seward
understood
the
change
and
had
now
received
strong
warnings
from
adams
and
weed
in
london
and
from
dayton
in
paris
but
these
were
not
needed
to
convince
him
that
america
must
yield
apparently
he
had
recognized
from
the
first
that
america
was
in
an
impossible
situation
and
that
the
prisoners
must
be
released
the
demand
were
the
comment
of
those
who
were
wise
after
the
event
was
that
true
policy
would
have
dictated
an
immediate
release
of
the
prisoners
as
seized
in
violation
of
international
law
before
any
complaint
could
be
received
from
great
britain
this
leaves
out
of
consideration
the
political
difficulties
at
home
of
an
administration
already
seriously
weakened
by
a
failure
to
press
the
war
and
it
also
fails
to
recognize
that
in
the
american
cabinet
itself
a
proposal
by
seward
to
release
made
immediately
would
in
all
probability
have
been
negatived
blair
in
the
cabinet
and
sumner
in
the
senate
were
indeed
in
favour
of
prompt
release
but
lincoln
seems
to
have
thought
the
prisoners
must
be
held
even
though
he
feared
they
might
become
white
elephants
all
that
seward
could
do
at
first
was
to
notify
adams
that
wilkes
had
acted
without
instructions
on
christmas
morning
the
cabinet
met
to
consider
the
answer
to
great
britain
sumner
attended
and
read
letters
from
bright
and
cobden
earnestly
urging
a
yielding
by
america
and
depicting
the
strength
of
british
feeling
bright
wrote
if
you
are
resolved
to
succeed
against
the
south
no
war
with
make
every
concession
that
can
be
made
do
even
hesitate
to
tell
the
world
you
will
even
concede
what
two
years
ago
no
power
would
have
asked
of
rather
than
give
another
nation
a
pretence
for
assisting
in
the
breaking
up
of
your
country
without
doubt
bright
letters
had
great
influence
on
lincoln
and
on
other
cabinet
members
greatly
aiding
seward
but
that
his
task
was
difficult
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
an
entire
discussion
brought
no
conclusion
adjournment
was
taken
until
the
next
day
and
after
another
long
debate
seward
had
the
fortune
to
persuade
his
associates
to
a
hearty
unanimity
on
december
the
american
reply
in
the
form
of
a
communication
to
lyons
was
presented
to
him
by
seward
on
the
and
on
that
same
day
lyons
forwarded
it
to
russell
it
did
not
contain
an
apology
but
lyons
wrote
that
since
the
prisoners
were
to
be
released
and
acknowledgment
was
made
that
reparation
was
due
to
great
britain
he
considered
that
british
demands
were
so
far
substantially
complied
with
that
he
should
remain
at
his
post
until
he
received
further
orders
seward
reply
was
immediately
printed
in
the
american
papers
lyons
reported
that
it
was
very
well
received
and
that
the
public
was
calm
and
apparently
contented
with
the
outcome
he
thought
that
thus
the
preparation
for
war
has
prevented
war
seward
argument
reviewed
at
great
length
all
the
conditions
of
the
incident
dilated
on
many
points
of
international
law
both
relevant
and
irrelevant
narrated
the
past
relations
of
the
two
nations
on
right
of
search
and
finally
took
the
ground
that
mason
and
slidell
were
contraband
of
war
and
justly
subject
to
capture
but
that
wilkes
had
erred
in
not
bringing
the
with
her
passengers
into
port
for
trial
by
an
american
prize
court
therefore
the
two
envoys
with
their
secretaries
would
be
handed
over
promptly
to
such
persons
as
lyons
might
designate
it
was
says
seward
biographer
not
a
great
state
paper
was
defective
in
argument
and
contained
many
contradictions
but
he
adds
that
it
was
intended
primarily
for
the
american
public
and
to
meet
the
situation
at
home
another
critic
sums
up
seward
difficulties
he
had
to
persuade
a
president
and
a
reluctant
cabinet
to
support
the
naval
idol
of
the
day
to
reconcile
a
congress
which
had
passed
resolutions
highly
commending
wilkes
and
to
pacify
a
public
earlier
worked
up
to
fever
pitch
still
more
important
than
assertions
about
the
nature
of
contraband
of
war
a
term
not
reconcilable
with
the
destination
of
the
was
the
likening
of
mason
and
slidell
to
ambassadors
of
independent
states
for
eight
months
seward
had
protested
to
europe
that
the
confederates
were
not
belligerents
but
insurgents
and
now
his
whole
argument
rested
on
the
fact
that
they
were
belligerents
but
this
did
not
later
alter
a
return
to
his
old
position
nor
prevent
renewed
arguments
to
induce
a
recall
by
european
states
of
their
proclamations
of
neutrality
on
the
afternoon
of
january
a
telegram
from
lyons
was
received
in
london
stating
that
the
envoys
would
be
released
and
the
next
day
came
his
despatch
enclosing
a
copy
of
seward
answer
the
envoys
themselves
did
not
reach
england
until
january
and
the
delay
in
their
voyage
gave
time
for
an
almost
complete
disappearance
of
public
interest
in
them
january
russell
instructed
lyons
that
great
britain
was
well
satisfied
with
the
fact
and
manner
of
the
american
answer
and
regarded
the
incident
as
closed
but
that
it
could
not
agree
with
portions
of
seward
argument
and
would
answer
these
later
this
was
done
on
january
but
the
reply
was
mainly
a
mere
formality
and
is
of
interest
only
as
revealing
a
further
shift
in
the
opinion
of
the
legal
advisers
with
emphasis
on
the
question
of
what
constitutes
contraband
possibly
the
british
government
was
embarrassed
by
the
fact
that
while
france
had
strongly
supported
england
at
washington
thouvenel
had
told
cowley
that
the
conduct
pursued
by
capt
wilkes
whether
the
united
states
claimed
to
be
considered
as
belligerents
as
a
government
engaged
in
putting
down
a
was
a
violation
of
all
those
principles
of
maritime
international
law
which
france
had
ever
supported
and
had
instructed
mercier
to
so
state
to
seward
this
implied
a
reflection
on
former
british
practice
especially
as
regards
the
exercise
of
a
right
of
search
to
recover
its
own
citizens
and
is
indicative
of
the
correctness
of
adams
judgment
that
one
main
reason
for
european
support
of
great
britain
in
the
crisis
was
the
general
desire
to
tie
her
to
a
limitation
of
belligerent
maritime
power
in
notifying
russell
of
the
release
of
the
prisoners
lyons
had
stated
that
he
would
caution
the
commander
of
the
ship
conveying
them
that
they
were
not
to
be
received
with
honours
or
treated
otherwise
than
as
distinguished
gentlemen
russell
was
equally
cautious
seeing
mason
shortly
after
arrival
in
london
unofficially
at
my
own
house
on
february
refusing
to
read
his
credentials
and
after
listening
to
a
statement
of
his
instructions
replying
that
nothing
had
hitherto
occurred
which
would
justify
or
induce
great
britain
to
depart
from
a
position
of
neutrality
russell
had
already
suggested
that
thouvenel
use
the
same
method
with
slidell
this
procedure
does
not
necessarily
indicate
a
change
in
governmental
attitude
for
it
is
exactly
in
line
with
that
pursued
toward
the
confederate
commissioners
before
the
but
the
controversy
might
naturally
have
been
expected
to
have
brought
about
an
relation
between
russell
and
a
southern
representative
that
it
did
not
do
so
is
evidence
of
russell
care
not
to
give
offence
to
northern
susceptibilities
also
in
relief
at
the
outcome
of
the
he
was
convinced
momentarily
at
least
that
the
general
british
suspicion
of
seward
was
unfounded
i
do
not
he
wrote
to
gladstone
believe
that
seward
has
any
animosity
to
this
country
it
is
all
buncom
apparently
it
was
beginning
to
be
realized
by
british
statesmen
that
seward
high
tone
which
they
had
interpreted
with
some
justification
earlier
as
especially
inimical
to
england
now
indicated
a
foreign
policy
based
upon
one
object
only
the
restoration
of
the
union
and
that
in
pursuit
of
this
object
he
was
but
seeking
to
make
clear
to
european
nations
that
the
united
states
was
still
powerful
enough
to
resent
foreign
interference
the
final
decision
in
the
affair
such
was
the
situation
in
the
american
cabinet
rested
on
seward
alone
and
that
decision
was
from
the
first
for
peace
nor
did
seward
later
hold
any
grudge
over
the
outcome
america
in
general
however
though
breathing
freely
again
as
the
war
cloud
passed
was
bitter
the
feeling
against
great
britain
is
of
intense
hatred
and
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
is
that
we
must
give
up
the
traitors
put
down
the
rebellion
increase
our
navy
perfect
the
discipline
of
the
men
in
the
field
and
then
fight
great
britain
lowell
in
one
of
the
most
emotional
of
his
bigelow
papers
wrote
on
january
it
do
seem
hardly
right
john
when
both
my
hands
was
full
to
stump
me
to
a
fight
john
your
cousin
tu
john
bull
ole
uncle
sez
he
guess
we
know
it
now
sez
he
lion
paw
is
all
the
law
accordin
to
thet
fit
for
you
an
me
it
was
not
the
demand
itself
for
the
release
of
mason
and
slidell
that
in
the
end
so
stirred
america
as
the
warlike
tone
of
the
british
press
and
the
preparations
of
the
government
even
after
their
surrender
america
was
further
incensed
by
british
boasting
that
america
had
yielded
to
a
threat
of
war
as
in
the
cartoon
of
a
penitent
small
boy
uncle
sam
who
says
he
is
very
sorry
and
that
he
did
mean
to
do
it
and
so
escapes
the
birching
britannia
was
about
to
administer
america
had
in
all
truth
yielded
to
a
threat
but
disliked
being
told
so
and
regarded
the
threat
itself
as
evidence
of
british
this
was
long
the
attitude
of
the
american
public
in
england
the
knowledge
of
america
decision
caused
a
great
national
sigh
of
relief
coupled
with
a
determination
to
turn
the
cold
shoulder
to
the
released
envoys
on
january
the
recounted
the
earlier
careers
of
mason
and
slidell
and
stated
that
these
two
more
than
any
other
men
were
responsible
for
the
traditional
american
insane
prejudice
against
england
an
assertion
for
which
no
facts
were
offered
in
proof
and
one
much
overestimating
the
influence
of
mason
and
slidell
on
american
politics
before
secession
they
were
about
the
most
worthless
booty
it
would
be
possible
to
extract
from
the
jaws
of
the
american
lion
so
we
do
sincerely
hope
that
our
countrymen
will
not
give
these
fellows
anything
in
the
shape
of
an
ovation
continuing
the
argued
what
they
and
their
secretaries
are
to
do
here
passes
our
conjecture
they
are
personally
nothing
to
us
they
must
not
suppose
because
we
have
gone
to
the
very
verge
of
a
great
war
to
rescue
them
that
therefore
they
are
precious
in
our
eyes
we
should
have
done
just
as
much
to
rescue
two
of
their
own
negroes
and
had
that
been
the
object
of
the
rescue
the
swarthy
pompey
and
caesar
would
have
had
just
the
same
right
to
triumphal
arches
and
municipal
addresses
as
mason
and
slidell
so
please
british
public
let
have
none
of
these
things
let
the
commissioners
come
up
quietly
to
town
and
have
their
say
with
anybody
who
may
have
time
to
listen
to
them
for
our
part
we
can
not
see
how
anything
they
have
to
tell
can
turn
the
scale
of
british
duty
and
deliberation
this
complete
reversal
not
to
say
somersault
by
the
leading
british
newspaper
was
in
line
with
public
expressions
from
all
sections
save
the
extreme
adams
was
astonished
writing
privately
the
first
effect
of
the
surrender
has
been
extraordinary
the
current
which
ran
against
us
with
such
extreme
violence
six
weeks
ago
now
seems
to
be
going
with
equal
fury
in
our
favour
officially
on
the
same
day
he
explained
this
to
seward
as
caused
by
a
late
development
in
the
crisis
of
a
full
understanding
especially
among
the
quiet
and
religious
citizens
of
the
middle
classes
that
if
great
britain
did
engage
in
war
with
the
united
states
she
would
be
forced
to
become
the
ally
of
a
oligarchy
here
in
truth
lay
the
greatest
cause
of
british
anxiety
during
the
period
of
waiting
for
an
answer
and
of
relief
when
that
answer
was
received
if
england
and
america
became
enemies
wrote
argyll
we
necessarily
became
virtually
the
of
the
of
the
south
robert
browning
attempting
to
explain
to
his
friend
story
the
british
attitude
declared
that
early
in
the
war
britain
was
with
the
north
expecting
that
the
pure
and
simple
rights
of
in
the
case
would
be
declared
and
vigorously
carried
out
without
one
let
or
stop
but
that
lincoln
denial
of
emancipation
as
an
object
had
largely
destroyed
this
sympathy
browning
thought
this
an
excusable
though
a
mistaken
judgment
since
at
least
the
of
all
of
lincoln
acts
is
altogether
against
slavery
in
the
end
he
assured
story
that
the
latter
was
in
error
as
to
men
here
i
have
not
heard
one
man
woman
or
child
express
anything
but
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
being
obliged
to
go
to
war
on
any
grounds
with
america
and
after
the
affair
was
over
he
affirmed
the
purpose
of
the
north
is
also
understood
at
last
there
is
no
longer
the
notion
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
a
few
extreme
enthusiasts
held
public
meetings
and
passed
resolutions
commending
the
statesmanlike
ability
and
moderation
of
seward
and
rejoicing
that
great
britain
had
not
taken
sides
with
a
slave
power
in
general
however
such
sentiments
were
not
expressed
that
they
were
keenly
felt
nevertheless
is
certain
during
the
height
of
the
crisis
anthony
trollope
then
touring
america
even
while
sharing
fully
in
the
intense
british
indignation
against
captain
wilkes
wrote
these
people
speak
our
language
use
our
prayers
read
our
books
are
ruled
by
our
laws
dress
themselves
in
our
image
are
warm
with
our
blood
they
have
all
our
virtues
and
their
vices
are
our
own
too
loudly
as
we
call
out
against
them
they
are
our
sons
and
our
daughters
the
source
of
our
greatest
pride
and
as
we
grow
old
they
should
be
the
staff
of
our
age
such
a
war
as
we
should
now
wage
with
the
states
would
be
an
unloosing
of
hell
upon
all
that
is
best
upon
the
world
surface
the
expressions
of
men
like
browning
and
trollope
may
not
indeed
be
regarded
as
typical
of
either
governmental
or
general
public
reactions
much
more
exactly
and
with
more
authority
as
representing
that
thoughtful
opinion
of
which
adams
wrote
were
the
conclusions
of
john
stuart
mill
in
an
article
in
february
making
a
strong
plea
for
the
north
he
summarized
british
feeling
about
the
we
had
indeed
been
wronged
we
had
suffered
an
indignity
and
something
more
than
an
indignity
which
not
to
have
resented
would
have
been
to
invite
a
constant
succession
of
insults
and
injuries
from
the
same
and
from
every
other
quarter
we
could
have
acted
no
otherwise
than
we
have
done
yet
it
is
impossible
to
think
without
something
like
a
shudder
from
what
we
have
escaped
we
the
emancipators
of
the
slave
who
have
wearied
every
court
and
government
in
europe
and
america
with
our
protests
and
remonstrances
until
we
goaded
them
into
at
least
ostensibly
with
us
to
prevent
the
enslaving
of
the
negro
should
have
lent
a
hand
to
setting
up
in
one
of
the
most
commanding
positions
of
the
world
a
powerful
republic
devoted
not
only
to
slavery
but
to
propagandism
no
such
protestations
of
relief
over
escape
from
a
possible
alliance
with
the
south
were
made
officially
by
the
government
or
in
a
debate
upon
the
february
when
parliament
reassembled
in
the
lords
the
earl
of
shelburne
thought
that
america
should
have
made
a
frank
and
open
apology
the
earl
of
derby
twitted
the
united
states
with
having
yielded
to
force
alone
but
said
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
recognizing
the
confederacy
lord
dufferin
expressed
great
friendship
for
america
and
declared
that
englishmen
ought
to
make
themselves
better
informed
of
the
real
merits
of
the
civil
war
earl
granville
speaking
for
the
government
laid
stress
upon
the
difficulties
at
home
of
the
washington
administration
in
pacifying
public
opinion
and
asserted
a
personal
belief
that
strict
neutrality
was
england
best
policy
although
circumstances
may
arise
which
may
call
for
a
different
course
on
the
same
day
in
the
commons
the
debate
was
of
a
like
general
tenor
to
that
in
the
lords
but
disraeli
differed
from
his
chief
derby
in
that
he
thought
america
had
been
placed
in
a
very
difficult
position
in
which
she
had
acted
very
honourably
palmerston
took
much
credit
for
the
energetic
military
preparations
but
stated
from
that
position
of
strict
neutrality
it
is
not
our
intention
to
depart
an
important
declaration
if
taken
as
apparently
it
was
not
as
fixing
a
policy
in
substance
all
speakers
whether
whig
or
tory
praised
the
stand
and
expressed
gratification
with
the
peaceful
outcome
a
further
debate
on
the
was
precipitated
by
bright
on
february
in
connection
with
the
estimates
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
military
contingents
sent
to
canada
he
asserted
that
england
by
generously
trusting
to
american
honour
might
have
won
her
lasting
friendship
and
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
for
the
first
time
in
any
speech
made
by
him
bright
declared
that
the
war
was
one
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
palmerston
in
reply
made
no
comment
on
the
matter
of
slavery
but
energetically
defended
the
military
preparations
as
a
necessary
precaution
bright
speech
was
probably
intended
for
american
consumption
with
the
purpose
of
easing
american
by
showing
that
even
in
parliament
there
were
those
who
disapproved
of
that
show
of
force
to
which
america
so
much
objected
he
foresaw
that
this
would
long
be
the
basis
of
american
bitterness
but
palmerston
was
undoubtedly
correct
in
characterizing
bright
opinion
as
a
solitary
one
and
looked
at
from
a
distance
of
time
it
would
seem
that
a
british
government
impressed
as
it
was
with
a
sense
of
seward
unfriendliness
which
had
not
prepared
for
war
when
making
so
strong
a
demand
for
reparation
would
have
merited
the
heaviest
condemnation
if
mill
was
right
in
stating
that
the
demand
for
reparation
was
a
necessity
then
so
also
were
the
military
preparations
upon
the
government
the
acted
to
bring
to
a
head
and
make
more
clear
the
british
relation
to
the
civil
war
in
america
by
november
the
policy
of
strict
neutrality
adopted
in
may
had
begun
to
be
weakened
for
various
reasons
already
recited
weakened
not
to
the
point
of
any
cabinet
member
advocacy
of
change
but
in
a
restlessness
at
the
slow
development
of
a
solution
in
america
russell
was
beginning
to
at
least
of
recognition
of
the
confederacy
this
was
clear
to
lyons
who
though
against
such
recognition
had
understood
the
drift
if
schleiden
is
to
be
trusted
of
ministerial
opinion
schleiden
reported
on
december
that
lyons
had
expressed
to
him
much
pleasure
at
the
peaceful
conclusion
of
the
affair
and
had
added
england
will
be
too
generous
not
to
postpone
the
recognition
of
the
independence
of
the
south
as
long
as
possible
after
this
experience
but
the
operated
like
a
to
clear
the
atmosphere
it
brought
out
plainly
the
practical
difficulties
and
dangers
at
least
as
regards
canada
of
a
war
with
america
it
resulted
in
a
weakening
of
the
conviction
that
seward
was
unfriendly
it
produced
from
the
british
public
an
even
greater
expression
of
relief
when
the
incident
was
closed
than
of
anger
when
it
occurred
and
it
created
in
a
section
of
that
public
a
fixed
belief
shared
by
at
least
one
member
of
the
cabinet
that
the
issue
in
america
was
that
of
slavery
in
support
of
which
england
could
not
possibly
take
a
stand
this
did
not
mean
that
the
british
government
nor
any
large
section
of
the
public
believed
the
north
could
conquer
the
south
but
it
did
indicate
a
renewed
vigour
for
the
policy
of
neutrality
and
a
determination
not
to
get
into
war
with
america
adams
wrote
to
seward

am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
happening
of
the
affair
of
the

rather
opportune

later

volume

russell
took
up
this
matter
with
adams
and
as
a
result
of
an
interview
wrote
to
lyons
november
lord
palmerston
stated
to
adams
on
the
occasion
in
question
that
her
majesty
government
could
not
permit
any
interference
with
any
vessel
british
or
foreign
within
british
waters
that
with
regard
to

her
majesty
government
did
not
mean
to
dispute
the
belligerent
right
of
the
united
states
ships
of
war
to
search
them
but
that
the
exercise
of
that
right
and
the
right
of
detention
in
certain
conditions
must
in
each
case
be
dealt
with
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
discuss
such
matters
then
because
they
were
not
in
point
but
that
it
would
not
do
for
the
united
states
ships
of
war
to
harass
british
commerce
on
the
high
seas
under
the
pretence
of
preventing
the
confederates
from
receiving
things
that
are
contraband

i
took
an
opportunity
of
mentioning
to
adams
the
account
which
lord
palmerston
had
given
me
of
the
language
which
he
had
thus
held

nothing

subject

disprove
this

the

suspicion

is
shown

a
despatch

wrote
that

at

word

that
no

should

which
could
create
bad
blood
anew
because
the
strong
language
which
seward
had
used
in

his

despatches
seems
to
have
irritated

insulted
england
schleiden

no

lincoln

language
would
seem

imply
that
he
was
putting
pressure

the
prisoners

schleiden
apparently
so
interpreted
them
but
the
fact
was
that
at
the
date
when
this
was
written
lincoln
had
not
yet
committed
himself
to
accepting
seward
view
he
told
seward

the
blockade
the
six
months
following
the
affair
of
the
constituted
a
period
of
comparative
calm
in
the
relations
of
great
britain
and
america
but
throughout
that
period
there
was
steadily
coming
to
the
front
a
northern
belligerent
effort
increasingly
effective
increasingly
a
cause
for
disturbance
to
british
trade
and
therefore
more
and
more
a
matter
for
anxious
governmental
consideration
this
was
the
blockade
of
southern
ports
and
coast
line
which
lincoln
had
declared
in
his
proclamation
of
april
as
early
as
december
lyons
had
raised
the
question
of
the
relation
of
british
ships
and
merchants
to
the
secession
port
of
charleston
south
carolina
and
had
received
from
judge
black
an
evasive
reply
in
march
russell
had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
a
blockade
writing
to
lyons
that
american
precedent
would
at
least
require
it
to
be
an
effective
one
while
lyons
made
great
efforts
to
convince
seward
that
interference
with
british
trade
would
be
disastrous
to
the
northern
cause
in
england
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
hint
at
british
intervention
to
preserve
trade
but
on
april
lyons
while
believing
that
no
effective
blockade
was
possible
thought
that
the
attempt
to
institute
one
was
less
objectionable
than
legislation
closing
the
southern
ports
as
ports
of
entry
in
reality
a
mere
paper
blockade
and
one
which
would
justify
great
britain
and
france
in
recognizing
the
southern
confederacy
thus
he
began
to
weaken
in
opposition
to
interference
his
earlier
expressions
to
seward
were
but
arguments
without
committing
his
government
to
a
line
of
policy
and
were
intended
to
make
seward
step
cautiously
possibly
lyons
thought
he
could
frighten
the
north
out
of
a
blockade
campaign
but
when
the
civil
war
actually
began
and
lincoln
on
april
declared
he
had
deemed
it
advisable
to
set
on
foot
a
blockade
and
that
when
a
competent
force
had
been
posted
so
as
to
prevent
entrance
and
exit
of
vessels
warning
would
be
given
to
any
vessel
attempting
to
enter
or
to
leave
a
blockaded
port
with
endorsement
on
her
register
of
such
warning
followed
by
seizure
if
she
again
attempted
to
pass
the
blockade
lyons
felt
that
if
it
be
carried
on
with
reasonable
consideration
for
foreign
flags
and
in
strict
conformity
with
the
law
of
nations
i
suppose
it
must
be
recognized
the
proclamation
named
the
original
seven
seceding
states
and
on
april
virginia
was
added
the
blockade
was
actually
begun
at
certain
virginia
ports
on
april
and
by
the
end
of
may
there
were
a
few
off
all
the
more
important
southern
harbours
this
method
of
putting
a
blockade
into
effect
by
warning
at
the
port
rather
than
by
a
general
notification
communicated
to
european
governments
and
setting
a
date
involved
a
hardship
on
british
merchants
since
they
were
thereby
made
uncertain
whether
goods
started
for
a
southern
port
would
be
permitted
to
enter
in
practice
vessels
on
their
first
departure
from
a
blockaded
harbour
were
warned
and
permitted
to
go
out
but
those
seeking
to
enter
were
warned
and
turned
back
in
while
the
blockade
was
being
established
lincoln
proclamation
had
something
of
the
nature
for
the
timid
british
merchant
though
not
for
the
bold
one
of
a
paper
blockade
this
was
not
clearly
understood
by
lyons
who
thought
neutrals
must
acquiesce
having
exhausted
every
possible
means
of
opposition
but
who
consoled
himself
with
the
idea
that
for
some
time
yet
british
trade
could
be
carried
on
lyons
was
in
fact
sceptical
as
he
told
seward
in
a
long
conversation
on
april
of
the
possibility
of
blockading
a
mile
coast
line
but
seward
assured
him
it
would
be
done
and
effectively
the
british
press
was
equally
sceptical
and
in
any
case
believed
that
the
war
would
be
of
short
duration
so
that
there
need
be
no
anxiety
over
next
supply
of
cotton
in
parliament
russell
took
the
stand
that
the
blockade
if
carried
on
in
accordance
with
international
law
and
made
effective
required
british
recognition
and
respect
he
also
defended
lincoln
notification
at
the
port
method
stating
that
it
might
seem
a
hardship
but
was
perfectly
legal
thus
there
was
early
and
easy
acquiescence
in
the
american
effort
but
when
in
june
there
was
revived
a
northern
plan
to
close
southern
ports
by
legislative
action
britain
was
stirred
to
quick
and
vigorous
opposition
lyons
learned
that
a
bill
would
be
introduced
in
congress
giving
the
president
authority
among
other
powers
to
proclaim
the
ports
closed
thus
notifying
foreign
nations
not
to
attempt
to
use
them
he
saw
in
it
an
unexpected
application
of
the
northern
theory
that
the
south
was
not
a
belligerent
and
had
no
rights
as
such
and
he
regarded
it
as
in
effect
a
paper
blockade
the
fourth
section
of
the
bill
as
introduced
in
congress
did
not
direct
the
president
to
issue
a
proclamation
closing
southern
ports
it
merely
gave
him
the
power
to
do
so
almost
from
the
first
lyons
thought
that
lincoln
and
seward
were
too
wise
to
issue
such
a
proclamation
nevertheless
it
was
his
duty
to
be
on
guard
and
to
oppose
the
plan
for
six
weeks
there
was
much
communication
in
regard
to
the
southern
ports
bill
as
all
parties
called
it
from
russell
to
lyons
and
also
with
cowley
in
france
the
british
foreign
office
interest
in
the
matter
almost
rising
to
excitement
is
somewhat
astonishing
in
view
of
the
small
importance
evidently
attached
to
the
plan
at
washington
and
the
reluctance
of
france
to
be
as
vigorous
as
great
britain
in
protest
vigorous
russell
certainly
was
using
a
high
tone
in
official
remonstrance
to
america
not
unlike
that
taken
by
seward
on
british
recognition
of
southern
belligerency
immediately
on
learning
of
the
introduction
of
the
bill
russell
addressed
enquiries
to
cowley
asking
what
france
intended
and
urged
a
stiff
protest
thouvenel
had
not
heard
of
the
bill
and
was
seemingly
indifferent
at
first
he
acquiesced
in
russell
protest
then
drew
back
and
on
three
separate
occasions
promised
support
only
to
withdraw
such
promise
he
was
disinclined
said
cowley
to
join
in
a
friendly
hint
to
america
because
of
the
touchy
sensibilities
lately
shown
by
seward
and
feared
a
direct
protest
might
result
in
an
american
declaration
of
war
in
any
case
why
not
wait
until
the
president
act
and
even
then
the
proper
method
would
be
a
protest
rather
than
reprisals
i
wish
wrote
cowley
on
july
that
the
french
were
inclined
to
be
more
as
they
seemed
to
be
at
first
i
would
at
all
times
rather
have
the
task
of
calming
them
than
of
urging
them
on
nevertheless
russell
on
july
notified
lyons
that
england
would
not
observe
a
legislative
closing
of
southern
ports
on
july
lyons
telegraphed
that
the
bill
had
passed
both
houses
of
congress
and
on
the
sixteenth
he
wrote
privately
to
russell
that
he
was
much
disturbed
over
its
possible
consequences
since
even
sumner
was
for
it
as
this
indicated
a
real
intention
to
carry
it
into
effect
on
august
russell
sent
formal
instructions
of
protest
a
copy
of
which
was
to
be
handed
to
seward
but
the
next
day
authorized
lyons
to
exercise
discretion
as
to
communicating
the
despatch
the
original
form
of
this
instruction
dated
in
june
and
revised
in
july
concluded
with
language
that
might
well
draw
out
objection
to
a
threat
of
reprisals
it
read
that
reserve
the
right
of
acting
in
concert
with
other
nations
in
opposition
to
so
violent
an
attack
on
the
rights
of
commercial
countries
and
so
manifest
a
violation
of
international
law
this
high
tone
had
been
modified
possibly
by
french
opposition
possibly
by
early
opinion
that
the
bill
would
not
be
made
operative
indeed
on
july
russell
told
lyons
that
no
final
instruction
of
protest
would
be
sent
him
until
the
president
actually
issued
a
proclamation
yet
in
spite
of
being
fairly
well
assured
that
there
was
no
danger
in
the
southern
ports
bill
russell
did
send
the
instruction
of
august
still
distinctly
vigorous
in
tone
though
with
no
threat
of
reprisals
his
reason
for
doing
so
is
difficult
to
understand
certainly
he
was
hardly
serious
in
arguing
to
thouvenel
that
a
stiff
instruction
would
strengthen
the
hands
of
the
moderate
section
of
the
american
cabinet
or
else
he
strangely
misjudged
american
temperament
probably
a
greater
reason
was
his
wish
to
be
able
to
print
a
parliamentary
paper
indicating
the
watchful
care
he
was
exercising
in
guarding
british
interests
before
russell
instruction
could
reach
america
seward
had
voluntarily
reassured
lyons
as
to
american
intentions
lyons
reported
this
privately
on
july
but
on
the
same
day
also
reported
officially
that
two
days
earlier
that
is
on
the
eighteenth
he
and
mercier
had
discussed
the
southern
ports
bill
and
that
as
a
result
mercier
had
then
gone
that
same
day
to
seward
to
state
that
france
must
regard
such
a
measure
as
merely
a
paper
blockade
we
were
not
very
sanguine
of
success
wrote
lyons
but
seward
had
listened
to
him
mercier
with
calmness
and
personally
seemed
disinclined
to
issue
the
required
proclamation
this
despatch
making
it
appear
that
england
and
france
were
in
close
harmony
and
that
lyons
and
mercier
were
having
a
difficult
time
at
washington
was
printed
later
in
the
parliamentary
papers
it
was
received
by
russell
on
august
and
in
spite
of
the
reassurances
of
lyons
private
letter
naturally
not
for
printing
presumably
received
in
the
same
mail
with
the
official
despatch
it
furnished
the
basis
of
his
strong
instruction
of
august
at
washington
also
there
were
indications
of
an
effort
to
prepare
a
good
case
for
the
british
public
and
parliament
july
so
lyons
wrote
privately
seward
had
prevented
the
issue
of
the
southern
ports
proclamation
and
on
the
next
day
he
was
shown
by
seward
confidentially
an
instruction
to
adams
and
other
ministers
abroad
in
which
was
maintained
the
right
to
close
the
ports
by
proclamation
but
stating
the
government
decision
not
to
exercise
the
right
lyons
believed
this
was
the
end
of
the
matter
yet
on
august
he
presented
himself
formally
at
the
department
of
state
and
stated
that
he
had
instructions
to
declare
that
her
majesty
government
would
consider
a
decree
closing
the
ports
of
the
south
actually
in
possession
of
the
insurgent
or
confederate
states
as
null
and
void
and
that
they
would
not
submit
to
measures
taken
on
the
high
seas
in
pursuance
of
such
seward
thanked
me
for
the
consideration
i
had
shown
and
begged
me
to
confine
myself
for
the
present
to
the
verbal
announcement
i
had
just
made
he
said
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
draw
up
a
written
communication
which
would
not
have
the
air
of
a
threat
to
this
lyons
agreed
this
permitted
a
impression
to
englishmen
of
the
forthright
yet
friendly
tone
of
british
diplomats
when
dealing
with
seward
so
also
did
russell
instruction
of
august
not
yet
received
by
lyons
when
he
took
the
stage
at
washington
yet
there
is
a
possibility
that
lyons
was
in
fact
merely
playing
his
part
as
seward
had
asked
him
to
play
it
on
the
next
day
august
he
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
russell
communication
of
july
in
which
it
was
stated
that
while
great
britain
could
not
acquiesce
in
the
southern
ports
bill
final
would
be
sent
until
lincoln
issued
a
proclamation
lyons
now
explained
as
seward
is
undoubtedly
at
this
moment
opposed
to
closing
the
ports
i
have
thought
it
wiser
to
be
guided
by
him
for
the
present
as
to
the
mode
of
communicating
your
decision
about
the
matter
is
it
possible
that
seward
really
wished
to
have
a
strong
yet
not
too
strong
statement
from
lyons
in
order
to
combat
the
advocates
of
the
ports
bill
there
are
many
ramifications
of
diplomatic
policy
especially
in
a
popular
government
at
any
rate
on
august
lyons
could
assure
russell
that
there
was
no
question
now
of
issuing
the
proclamation
and
on
the
nineteenth
could
write
officially
that
a
proclamation
based
on
the
bill
had
indeed
been
issued
but
without
the
objectionable
fourth
section
the
whole
affair
of
the
southern
ports
bill
occupies
more
space
in
the
british
parliamentary
papers
and
excited
more
attention
from
the
british
government
than
it
would
seem
to
have
merited
from
the
washington
attitude
toward
it
the
bill
had
been
drawn
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
its
other
sections
related
to
methods
of
meeting
a
situation
where
former
customs
houses
and
places
for
the
collection
of
import
duties
were
now
in
the
hands
of
the
confederacy
the
fourth
section
alone
implied
a
purpose
to
declare
a
paper
blockade
the
idea
of
proclaiming
closed
the
southern
ports
may
have
at
first
received
the
sanction
of
seward
as
consistent
with
his
denial
of
the
existence
of
a
war
or
it
may
have
been
a
part
of
his
high
tone
foreign
policy
but
the
more
reasonable
supposition
is
that
the
bill
was
merely
one
of
many
measures
put
forth
in
the
first
months
of
the
war
by
the
north
in
its
spasm
of
energy
seeking
to
use
every
and
any
public
means
to
attack
the
south
but
the
interest
attached
to
the
measure
in
this
work
is
the
british
attitude
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
russell
in
presenting
papers
to
parliament
was
desirous
of
making
clear
two
points
first
the
close
harmony
with
france
which
in
fact
was
not
so
close
as
was
made
to
appear
second
the
care
and
vigour
of
the
foreign
secretary
in
guarding
british
interests
now
in
fact
british
trade
was
destined
to
be
badly
hurt
by
the
blockade
but
as
yet
had
not
been
greatly
hampered
nor
did
russell
yet
think
an
effective
blockade
feasible
writing
to
lyons
a
week
after
his
official
protest
on
the
southern
ports
bill
he
expressed
the
opinion
that
a
blockade
could
not
possibly
prevent
trade
with
the
south
if
our
ships
can
go
in
ballast
for
cotton
to
the
southern
ports
it
will
be
well
but
if
this
can
not
be
done
by
agreement
there
will
be
surely
in
the
extent
of
miles
creeks
and
bays
out
of
which
small
vessels
may
come
and
run
for
jamaica
or
the
bahamas
where
the
cargoes
might
be
transhipped
but
it
is
not
for
downing
street
to
suggest
such
plans
to
cheapside
and
tooley
street
a
better
knowledge
of
american
geography
would
have
made
clear
to
russell
that
if
but
seven
southern
ports
were
effectively
blockaded
the
remaining
miles
of
coast
line
would
be
useless
for
the
export
of
cotton
in
any
considerable
amount
his
bays
and
creeks
did
indeed
long
provide
access
to
small
vessels
but
these
were
not
adequate
for
the
transport
of
a
bulky
export
like
cotton
to
russell
however
the
blockade
appearing
negligible
in
probable
effect
and
also
not
open
to
objection
by
neutrals
if
regularly
established
it
seemed
that
any
immediate
danger
to
british
trade
was
averted
by
the
final
american
action
on
the
southern
ports
bill
it
was
not
until
the
blockade
did
begin
to
be
thoroughly
effective
that
either
the
british
public
or
government
gave
it
serious
consideration
not
again
until
late
november
did
russell
return
with
any
interest
to
the
subject
of
the
blockade
and
then
it
was
again
on
an
american
effort
which
seemed
to
indicate
the
ineffectiveness
of
blockading
squadrons
and
a
plan
to
remedy
this
by
unusual
even
uncivilized
if
not
illegal
methods
this
was
the
stone
boat
fleet
plan
of
blocking
charleston
harbour
by
sinking
vessels
across
the
entrance
bar
the
plan
was
reported
by
lyons
and
the
news
received
in
england
at
the
most
uncertain
moment
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
controversy
british
press
and
government
at
first
placed
no
stress
on
it
presumably
because
of
the
feeling
that
in
view
of
the
existing
crisis
it
was
a
minor
matter
in
the
same
week
lyons
having
been
asked
by
russell
for
an
opinion
on
the
blockade
answered
i
am
a
good
deal
puzzled
as
to
how
i
ought
to
answer
your
question
whether
i
consider
the
blockade
effective
it
is
certainly
by
no
means
strict
or
vigorous
along
the
immense
extent
of
coast
to
which
it
is
supposed
to
apply
i
suppose
the
ships
which
run
it
successfully
both
in
and
out
are
more
numerous
than
those
which
are
intercepted
on
the
other
hand
it
is
very
far
from
being
a
mere
paper
blockade
a
great
many
vessels
are
captured
it
is
a
most
serious
interruption
to
trade
and
if
it
were
as
ineffective
as
jefferson
davis
says
in
his
message
he
would
not
be
so
very
anxious
to
get
rid
of
it
this
was
a
very
fair
description
of
the
blockade
situation
lyons
unaffected
by
irritations
resulting
from
the
showed
the
frame
of
mind
of
a
determined
neutral
as
he
was
fond
of
describing
himself
his
answer
was
the
first
given
to
russell
indicating
a
possibility
that
the
blockade
might
after
all
become
strictly
effective
and
thus
exceedingly
harmful
to
british
trade
there
is
no
direct
that
this
influenced
russell
to
denounce
the
plan
of
blocking
southern
harbours
with
boats
sunk
in
the
channel
but
the
existence
of
such
a
motive
seems
probable
moreover
his
protest
was
not
made
until
december
the
he
had
learned
officially
from
adams
that
wilkes
was
unauthorized
in
searching
the
a
day
on
which
strain
and
uncertainty
regarding
american
intentions
were
greatly
lessened
russell
then
wrote
to
lyons
that
he
observed
it
to
be
stated
apparently
on
good
authority
that
the
declared
purpose
of
the
stone
boat
fleet
was
of
destroying
these
harbours
for
ever
he
characterized
this
as
implying
utter
despair
of
the
restoration
of
the
union
and
as
being
only
a
measure
of
revenge
and
irremediable
injury
against
an
enemy
but
even
in
this
view
as
a
scheme
of
embittered
and
sanguinary
war
such
a
measure
is
not
justifiable
it
is
a
plot
against
the
commerce
of
nations
and
the
free
intercourse
of
the
southern
states
of
america
with
the
civilized
world
it
is
a
project
worthy
only
of
times
of
barbarism
lyons
was
instructed
to
speak
in
this
sense
to
seward
who
it
was
hoped
would
disavow
the
project
there
was
nothing
in
lyons
despatches
nor
in
the
american
newspaper
extracts
accompanying
them
to
warrant
such
accusation
and
expostulation
lyons
had
merely
commented
that
by
some
in
america
the
project
had
been
characterized
as
odious
and
barbarous
adding
the
question
seems
to
depend
on
the
extent
to
which
the
harbours
will
be
permanently
injured
it
will
be
noted
that
russell
did
not
refer
to
information
received
from
lyons
though
it
was
already
in
hand
but
to
apparently
good
authority
in
justification
of
his
vigorous
denunciation
but
like
vigour
and
like
characterization
of
american
barbarism
did
not
appear
in
the
british
press
until
after
the
news
arrived
of
the
release
of
mason
and
slidell
then
the
storm
broke
well
summed
up
in
the
punch
cartoon
entitled
retrogression
a
very
sad
picture
war
dance
of
the
indian
and
showing
uncle
sam
in
and
with
in
his
hand
a
flag
made
of
the
york
dancing
in
glee
on
the
shores
of
a
deserted
harbour
across
which
stretched
a
row
of
sunken
ships
on
january
the
liverpool
shipowners
association
called
the
attention
of
the
foreign
office
to
the
news
that
charleston
harbour
had
been
closed
by
stone
boats
and
urged
governmental
remonstrance
hammond
at
once
replied
quoting
the
language
of
russell
letter
of
december
and
stating
that
further
representations
would
be
made
on
the
sixteenth
russell
again
instructed
lyons
to
speak
to
seward
but
now
was
much
less
rasping
in
language
arguing
rather
the
injury
in
the
future
to
the
united
states
itself
in
case
the
harbours
were
permanently
destroyed
since
the
object
of
war
is
peace
and
the
purposes
of
peace
are
mutual
goodwill
and
advantageous
commercial
intercourse
it
seems
absurd
that
any
save
the
most
ignorant
observer
should
have
thought
the
north
contemplated
a
permanent
and
revengeful
destruction
of
southern
port
facilities
nor
was
there
any
just
ground
for
such
an
extreme
british
view
of
the
northern
plan
yet
even
robert
browning
was
affected
by
the
popular
outcry
for
what
will
you
do
he
wrote
story
if
charleston
becomes
loyal
again
a
query
expressive
of
the
increasing
english
concern
even
alarm
at
the
intense
bitterness
indicating
a
long
war
of
the
american
belligerents
how
absurd
not
to
say
ridiculous
was
this
british
concern
at
an
american
lapse
toward
barbarism
was
soon
made
evident
on
january
ii
lyons
acting
on
the
instructions
of
december
brought
up
the
matter
with
seward
and
was
promptly
assured
that
there
was
no
plan
whatever
to
injure
the
harbours
permanently
seward
stated
that
there
had
never
been
any
plan
even
to
sink
boats
in
the
main
entrance
channels
but
merely
the
lesser
channels
because
the
secretary
of
the
navy
had
reported
that
with
the
blockading
fleet
he
could
stop
up
the
holes
but
could
not
stop
up
the
ones
seward
assured
lyons
that
just
as
soon
as
the
union
was
restored
all
obstructions
would
be
removed
and
he
added
that
the
best
proof
that
the
entrance
to
charleston
harbour
had
not
been
destroyed
was
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
blockading
vessels
and
stone
boats
a
british
steamer
laden
with
contraband
of
war
had
just
succeeded
in
getting
in
again
on
february
this
time
following
russell
instruction
of
january
lyons
approached
seward
and
was
told
that
he
might
inform
russell
that
all
the
vessels
laden
with
stone
which
had
been
prepared
for
obstructing
the
harbours
had
been
already
sunk
and
that
it
is
not
likely
that
any
others
will
be
used
for
that
purpose
this
was
no
yielding
to
great
britain
nor
even
an
answer
to
russell
accusation
of
barbarity
the
fact
was
that
the
plan
of
obstruction
of
harbours
extending
even
to
placing
a
complete
barrier
had
been
undertaken
by
the
navy
with
little
expectation
of
success
and
on
the
first
appearance
of
new
channels
made
by
the
wash
of
waters
was
soon
abandoned
the
british
outcry
russell
assumption
in
protest
that
america
was
conducting
war
with
barbarity
and
the
protest
itself
may
seem
at
first
glance
to
have
been
merely
manifestations
of
a
british
tendency
to
meddle
as
a
superior
nation
in
the
affairs
of
other
states
and
to
give
advice
a
hectoring
of
peoples
whose
civilization
was
presumably
less
advanced
than
that
which
stamped
the
englishman
was
according
to
matthew
arnold
traditional
was
a
characteristic
of
british
public
and
government
alike
but
this
is
scarcely
a
satisfactory
explanation
in
the
present
case
for
in
the
first
place
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
sinking
of
obstructions
in
an
harbours
in
order
to
render
more
effective
a
blockade
was
no
novelty
in
maritime
warfare
as
russell
must
have
well
known
and
that
there
was
no
modern
record
of
such
obstructions
having
permanently
destroyed
a
harbour
a
far
more
reasonable
explanation
is
that
which
connects
the
energy
of
the
british
government
in
opposing
a
proposed
american
closing
of
southern
harbours
by
presidential
proclamation
with
a
like
energy
against
the
stone
boat
project
the
first
method
was
indeed
rightly
regarded
as
a
violation
of
accustomed
maritime
belligerency
but
both
methods
were
primarily
objectionable
in
british
eyes
because
they
were
very
evidently
the
result
of
efforts
to
find
a
way
in
which
an
as
yet
ineffective
blockade
could
be
made
more
rigorous
on
the
impossibility
of
an
effective
blockade
if
conducted
on
customary
lines
the
british
people
and
foreign
secretary
had
pinned
their
faith
that
there
would
be
no
serious
interruption
of
trade
this
was
still
the
view
in
january
though
doubts
were
arising
and
the
stone
boat
protest
must
be
regarded
as
another
evidence
of
watchful
guardianship
of
commerce
with
the
south
the
very
thought
that
the
blockade
might
become
effective
in
which
case
all
precedent
would
demand
respect
for
it
possibly
caused
russell
to
use
a
tone
not
customary
with
him
in
upbraiding
the
north
for
a
planned
barbarity
within
three
months
the
blockade
and
its
effectiveness
was
to
be
made
the
subject
of
the
first
serious
parliamentary
discussion
on
the
civil
war
in
america
in
another
three
months
the
government
began
to
feel
a
pressure
from
its
associate
in
joint
attitude
france
to
examine
again
with
much
care
its
asserted
policy
of
strict
neutrality
and
this
because
of
the
increased
effectiveness
of
the
blockade
meanwhile
another
american
question
was
serving
to
cool
somewhat
british
eagerness
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
france
for
nearly
forty
years
since
independence
from
spain
the
mexican
republic
had
offered
a
thorny
problem
to
european
nations
since
it
was
difficult
in
the
face
of
the
american
monroe
doctrine
to
put
sufficient
pressure
upon
her
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
just
claims
of
foreign
creditors
in
measures
were
being
prepared
by
france
great
britain
and
spain
to
act
jointly
in
the
matter
of
mexican
debts
commenting
on
these
measures
president
buchanan
in
his
annual
message
to
congress
of
december
had
sounded
a
note
of
warning
to
europe
indicating
that
american
principles
would
compel
the
use
of
force
in
aid
of
mexico
if
efforts
were
made
the
excuse
for
a
plan
to
deprive
our
neighbouring
republic
of
portions
of
her
territory
but
this
was
at
the
moment
of
the
of
the
union
and
attracted
little
attention
in
the
united
states
for
the
same
reason
no
longer
fearing
an
american
block
to
these
plans
the
three
european
governments
after
their
invitation
to
the
united
states
to
join
them
had
been
refused
signed
a
convention
october
to
force
a
payment
of
debts
by
mexico
they
pledged
themselves
however
to
seek
no
accession
of
territory
and
not
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
mexico
in
this
pledge
great
britain
and
spain
were
sincere
napoleon
iii
was
not
was
indeed
pursuing
a
policy
not
at
first
understood
even
by
his
ministers
a
joint
expedition
under
the
leadership
of
the
spanish
general
prim
was
despatched
and
once
in
mexico
took
possession
of
customs
houses
and
began
to
collect
duties
it
soon
became
evident
to
the
british
and
spanish
agents
on
the
spot
that
france
had
far
other
objects
than
the
mere
satisfaction
of
debts
the
result
was
a
clash
of
interests
followed
by
separate
agreements
with
mexico
and
the
withdrawal
of
forces
by
great
britain
and
spain
this
difference
of
view
on
mexican
policy
had
become
clear
to
cowley
british
ambassador
at
paris
by
january
and
from
that
month
until
the
end
of
march
his
private
letters
to
russell
referring
to
american
affairs
in
general
are
almost
wholly
concerned
with
french
designs
on
mexico
cowley
learned
that
earlier
rumours
of
napoleon
purpose
to
place
the
archduke
maximilian
of
austria
upon
the
of
mexico
far
from
being
unfounded
were
but
faint
indications
of
a
great
french
colonial
empire
scheme
and
he
thought
that
there
was
some
to
the
united
states
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
he
feared
that
the
mexican
question
would
give
us
a
deal
of
trouble
yet
and
by
march
was
writing
of
the
monstrous
claims
on
the
mexican
govt
made
by
france
these
reactions
of
cowley
were
fully
shared
by
russell
and
he
hastened
in
march
to
withdraw
british
forces
in
mexico
as
also
did
spain
great
britain
believed
that
she
had
been
tricked
into
a
false
position
in
mexico
hastened
to
escape
from
it
but
in
view
of
the
close
relation
of
joint
policy
with
france
toward
the
civil
war
in
america
undertook
no
direct
opposition
though
prophesying
an
evil
result
this
situation
required
france
to
refrain
for
a
time
from
criticism
of
british
policy
and
action
toward
the
north
to
pursue
in
brief
a
follow
on
policy
rather
than
one
based
on
its
own
initiative
on
the
british
side
the
french
mexican
policy
created
a
suspicion
of
napoleon
hidden
purposes
and
objects
in
the
civil
war
and
made
the
british
government
slow
to
accept
french
suggestions
the
result
was
that
in
relation
to
that
war
great
britain
set
the
pace
and
france
had
to
keep
step
a
very
advantageous
situation
for
the
north
as
the
event
was
to
prove
on
the
purely
mexican
question
lyons
early
took
opportunity
to
assure
seward
that
great
britain
was
entirely
averse
to
any
interference
in
the
internal
affairs
of
mexico
and
that
nothing
could
be
further
from
their
wishes
than
to
impose
upon
the
mexican
nation
any
government
not
of
its
own
choice
british
dislike
of
france
mexican
venture
served
to
swell
the
breeze
of
amity
toward
america
that
had
sprung
up
once
the
was
beyond
the
horizon
and
made
temporarily
for
smooth
sailing
in
the
relations
of
great
britain
and
the
north
lyons
wrote
on
february
that
the
present
notion
appears
to
be
to
overwhelm
us
with
demonstrations
of
friendship
and
confidence
adams
son
in
london
thought
our
work
here
is
past
its
crisis
and
that
our
victory
is
won
on
this
side
the
water
while
the
american
minister
himself
believed
that
the
prospect
of
interference
with
us
is
growing
more
and
more
remote
russell
also
was
optimistic
writing
to
lyons
our
relations
have
now
got
into
a
very
smooth
groove
there
is
no
longer
any
excitement
here
upon
the
question
of
america
i
fear
europe
is
going
to
supplant
the
affairs
of
america
as
an
exciting
topic
meaning
presumably
disturbances
arising
in
italy
on
april
adams
described
his
diplomatic
duties
as
almost
in
a
state
of
profound
calm
this
quiet
in
relation
to
america
is
evidence
that
no
matter
what
anxiety
was
felt
by
british
statesmen
over
the
effects
of
the
blockade
there
was
as
yet
no
inclination
seriously
to
question
its
legality
that
there
was
nevertheless
real
anxiety
is
shown
by
an
urgent
letter
from
westbury
to
palmerston
upon
the
blockade
asserting
that
if
cotton
brought
but
four
pence
at
charleston
and
thirteen
pence
at
liverpool
there
must
be
some
truth
in
its
alleged
effectiveness
i
am
greatly
opposed
to
any
violent
interference
do
not
let
us
give
the
federal
states
any
pretence
for
saying
that
they
failed
thro
our
interference
patience
for
a
few
more
weeks
is
i
am
satisfied
the
wiser
and
the
more
expedient
policy
illustration
king
cotton
bound
or
the
modern
prometheus
by
permission
of
the
proprietors
of
punch
this
would
indicate
some
cabinet
discussion
at
least
on
the
blockade
and
on
british
trade
interests
but
westbury
few
more
weeks
had
no
place
in
russell
thought
for
on
february
he
wrote
to
lyons
in
regard
to
assertions
being
made
that
the
blockade
was
ineffective
because
certain
vessels
had
eluded
it
her
majesty
government
however
are
of
opinion
that
assuming
that
the
blockade
is
duly
notified
and
also
that
a
number
of
ships
is
stationed
and
remains
at
the
entrance
of
a
port
sufficient
really
to
prevent
access
to
it
or
to
create
an
evident
danger
of
entering
or
leaving
it
and
that
these
ships
do
not
voluntarily
permit
ingress
or
egress
the
fact
that
various
ships
may
have
successfully
escaped
through
it
as
in
the
particular
instances
here
referred
to
will
not
of
itself
prevent
the
blockade
from
being
an
effective
one
by
international
law
from
this
view
russell
never
departed
in
official
instructions
england
position
as
the
leading
maritime
power
made
it
inevitable
that
she
should
promptly
approve
the
northern
blockade
effort
and
be
cautious
in
criticizing
its
legitimate
operation
both
her
own
history
and
probable
future
interests
when
a
belligerent
required
such
a
policy
far
more
important
in
the
eyes
of
statesmen
than
any
temporary
injury
to
british
commerce
english
merchants
if
determined
to
trade
with
the
south
must
take
their
own
risks
and
that
russell
believed
they
would
do
so
is
evidenced
by
his
comment
to
adams
that
it
was
a
tradition
of
the
sea
that
englishmen
would
if
money
were
to
be
made
by
it
send
supplies
even
to
hell
at
the
risk
of
burning
their
sails
but
trade
problems
with
the
south
soon
brought
real
pressure
on
the
government
in
january
while
marking
time
until
mason
should
arrive
at
his
post
the
confederate
commissioners
already
in
london
very
nearly
took
a
step
that
might
have
prejudiced
the
new
envoy
position
they
had
now
learned
through
public
documents
that
russell
had
informed
adams
he
had
no
intention
of
seeing
them
again
very
angry
they
planned
a
formal
protest
to
the
british
government
but
in
the
end
mann
and
rost
counselled
silence
outvoting
yancey
on
his
arrival
mason
ignored
this
situation
and
with
cause
for
warmly
received
socially
in
circles
he
felt
confident
that
at
least
a
private
reception
would
soon
be
given
him
by
russell
he
became
indeed
somewhat
of
a
social
lion
and
mistaking
this
personal
popularity
for
evidence
of
parliamentary
if
not
governmental
attitude
was
confident
of
quick
advantages
for
the
south
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
he
wrote
unofficially
to
hunter
confederate
secretary
of
state
although
the
ministry
may
hang
back
in
regard
to
the
blockade
and
recognition
through
the
queen
speech
at
the
opening
of
parliament
next
week
the
popular
voice
through
the
house
of
commons
will
demand
i
shall
be
disappointed
if
the
parliament
does
not
insist
on
definite
action
by
the
ministry
carefully
considering
the
situation
and
taking
the
advice
of
many
english
friends
mason
and
slidell
agreed
that
the
best
line
to
take
was
to
lay
aside
for
the
moment
the
claim
to
recognition
and
to
urge
european
repudiation
of
the
blockade
slidell
arrived
in
paris
wrote
mason
that
in
his
coming
interview
with
thouvenel
he
should
make
only
a
passing
allusion
to
the
question
of
recognition
intimating
that
on
that
point
i
am
not
disposed
at
present
to
press
consideration
but
i
shall
insist
upon
the
inefficiency
of
the
blockade
the
of
the
stone
fleet
etc
mason
was
urged
to
take
a
like
course
with
russell
both
men
were
much
excited
by
a
document
a
copy
of
which
had
been
secured
by
mann
purporting
to
be
a
confidential
memorandum
addressed
by
england
to
the
continental
powers
asking
whether
the
time
had
not
come
to
raise
the
blockade
no
such
memorandum
existed
but
slidell
and
mason
believed
it
genuine
they
had
great
hopes
of
the
opening
of
parliament
but
when
that
event
took
place
february
and
the
only
references
in
debate
were
to
the
and
its
fortunate
outcome
mason
was
puzzled
and
chagrined
he
wrote
it
is
thought
that
silence
as
to
the
blockade
was
intended
to
leave
that
question
open
this
no
doubt
was
the
consolatory
explanation
of
his
friends
but
the
unofficial
interview
with
russell
at
his
home
on
february
chilled
mason
hopes
as
agreed
with
slidell
emphasis
in
this
interview
was
laid
by
mason
on
the
blockade
though
recognition
was
asked
his
report
to
richmond
shows
that
he
proceeded
with
great
caution
omitting
portions
of
his
instructions
on
cotton
for
fear
of
arousing
antagonism
and
venturing
only
a
slight
departure
by
expressing
the
hope
that
if
great
britain
wished
to
renew
communication
with
the
confederacy
it
might
be
made
through
him
rather
than
through
the
british
consuls
at
the
south
russell
only
reply
was
he
hoped
i
might
find
my
residence
in
london
agreeable
he
refused
to
see
mason
credentials
stating
this
to
be
unnecessary
our
relations
being
unofficial
he
listened
with
courtesy
asked
a
few
questions
but
seemed
utterly
disinclined
to
enter
into
conversation
at
all
as
to
the
policy
of
his
government
and
only
said
in
substance
they
must
await
events
certainly
it
was
a
cool
reception
and
mason
departed
with
the
conviction
that
personal
sympathies
were
not
with
us
and
his
policy
inaction
but
mason
still
counted
on
parliamentary
pressure
on
the
government
and
he
was
further
encouraged
in
this
view
by
a
letter
from
spence
at
liverpool
stating
that
he
had
just
received
a
request
to
come
to
london
from
a
government
quarter
of
all
the
the
summons
of
spence
to
london
shows
that
the
government
itself
feared
somewhat
a
move
in
parliament
he
reported
to
mason
that
interviews
had
taken
place
with
palmerston
and
with
russell
that
he
had
unfortunately
missed
one
with
gladstone
and
while
not
citing
these
men
directly
declared
the
general
london
idea
to
be
that
of
postponement
since
it
was
inevitable
that
the
north
will
break
down
in
a
few
months
on
the
score
of
money
and
that
we
have
only
to
wait
three
months
evidently
spence
believed
he
was
being
used
as
an
intermediary
and
influential
adviser
in
circles
to
persuade
them
to
a
period
of
quiet
this
he
thought
was
unwise
since
delay
would
be
injurious
of
like
opinion
were
the
two
members
of
parliament
who
were
throughout
mason
career
in
england
to
be
his
closest
advisers
these
were
gregory
and
lindsay
the
former
possessing
somewhat
of
a
following
in
the
class
the
latter
the
largest
shipowner
in
great
britain
their
advice
also
was
to
press
on
the
blockade
question
as
a
matter
of
primary
british
commercial
interest
and
they
believed
that
france
was
eager
to
follow
a
british
lead
this
was
contrary
to
slidell
notion
at
the
moment
but
of
this
mason
was
unaware
the
government
did
indeed
feel
compelled
to
lay
before
parliament
the
papers
on
the
blockade
this
was
a
bulky
document
of
one
hundred
and
pages
and
covered
the
period
from
may
to
february
in
it
were
the
details
of
the
institution
of
the
blockade
reports
from
british
consuls
on
its
effectiveness
lists
of
vessels
captured
and
of
vessels
evading
it
all
together
furnishing
a
very
complete
view
of
this
the
principal
maritime
belligerent
effort
of
the
north
the
blockade
papers
gave
opportunity
for
debate
if
desired
and
especially
so
as
almost
at
the
end
of
this
document
appeared
that
instruction
of
february
by
russell
to
lyons
which
clearly
stated
british
acceptance
of
the
blockade
as
effective
mason
interview
with
russell
occurred
on
the
tenth
five
days
later
after
spence
had
been
urged
vainly
to
use
his
influence
for
postponement
russell
so
it
must
appear
gave
challenge
to
sentiment
by
asserting
the
effectiveness
of
the
blockade
a
challenge
almost
immediately
made
known
to
parliament
by
the
presentation
of
papers
unless
southern
sympathizers
were
meekly
to
acquiesce
without
further
protest
in
governmental
policy
they
must
now
make
some
decided
effort
this
came
in
the
shape
of
a
debate
in
the
commons
on
march
of
a
motion
by
gregory
urging
the
government
to
declare
the
blockade
ineffective
and
of
a
similar
debate
on
march
in
the
lords
as
is
inevitable
where
many
speakers
participate
in
a
debate
the
arguments
advanced
were
repeated
and
reiterated
in
the
commons
important
speeches
for
the
motion
were
made
by
gregory
bentinck
sir
james
ferguson
lord
robert
cecil
and
lindsay
while
against
it
appeared
forster
and
monckton
milnes
the
roundell
palmer
presented
the
government
view
gregory
opened
the
debate
by
seeking
to
make
clear
that
while
himself
favourable
to
recognition
of
the
south
the
present
motion
had
no
essential
bearing
on
that
question
and
was
directed
wholly
to
a
that
the
blockade
was
not
in
reality
effective
and
should
not
be
recognized
as
such
he
presented
and
analysed
statistics
to
prove
the
frequency
with
which
vessels
passed
through
the
blockade
using
the
summaries
given
by
mason
to
russell
in
their
interview
of
february
which
were
now
before
parliament
in
the
document
on
the
blockade
just
presented
and
he
cited
the
reports
of
bunch
at
charleston
as
further
evidence
this
was
the
burden
of
gregory
argument
but
he
glanced
in
passing
at
many
other
points
favourable
to
the
south
commenting
on
its
free
trade
principles
depicting
the
stone
fleet
as
a
barbarity
asserting
the
right
of
the
south
to
secede
declaring
that
france
regarded
british
attitude
as
determined
by
a
selfish
policy
looking
to
future
wars
and
attacking
seward
on
the
ground
of
american
inconsistency
falsely
paraphrasing
him
as
stating
that
as
for
all
those
principles
of
international
law
which
we
have
ever
upheld
they
are
as
but
dust
in
the
balance
compared
with
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
gregory
concluded
with
the
statement
that
the
united
states
should
be
treated
with
justice
and
nothing
more
when
presenting
a
cause
in
parliament
its
advocates
should
agree
on
a
line
of
argument
the
whole
theory
of
this
movement
on
the
blockade
was
that
it
was
wise
to
minimize
the
question
of
recognition
and
gregory
had
laboured
to
prove
that
this
was
not
related
to
a
refusal
longer
to
recognize
the
blockade
but
bentinck
the
second
speaker
for
the
motion
promptly
undid
him
for
he
unhappily
admitted
that
recognition
and
blockade
questions
were
so
closely
interwoven
that
they
could
not
be
considered
separately
this
was
promptly
seized
upon
by
forster
who
led
in
opposition
forster
main
argument
however
was
a
very
able
tearing
to
pieces
of
gregory
figures
showing
that
nearly
all
the
alleged
blockade
runners
were
in
reality
merely
small
coasting
steamers
which
by
use
of
shallow
inner
channels
could
creep
along
the
shore
and
then
make
a
dash
for
the
west
indies
the
effectiveness
of
the
blockade
of
main
ports
for
vessels
carrying
bulky
cargoes
was
proved
he
declared
by
the
price
of
raw
cotton
in
england
where
it
was
per
cent
greater
than
in
the
south
and
of
salt
in
charleston
where
the
importer
could
make
a
profit
of
per
cent
to
raise
the
blockade
he
argued
would
be
a
direct
violation
by
britain
of
her
neutrality
the
real
reason
for
this
motion
was
not
the
of
the
blockade
but
the
effectiveness
and
the
real
object
an
english
object
not
a
southern
one
gregory
was
taunted
for
changing
a
motion
to
recognize
the
confederacy
into
the
present
one
because
he
knew
the
former
would
fail
while
the
present
motion
was
deceitfully
intended
to
secure
the
same
end
forster
strongly
approved
the
conduct
of
the
government
in
preserving
strict
neutrality
alleging
that
any
other
conduct
would
have
meant
a
war
in
which
she
england
would
have
had
to
fight
for
slavery
against
her
kinsmen
gregory
speech
was
cautious
and
attempted
to
preserve
a
judicial
tone
of
argument
on
fact
forster
reads
like
that
of
one
who
knows
his
cause
already
won
gregory
had
no
fire
in
it
and
was
characterized
by
henry
adams
an
interested
auditor
as
listened
to
as
you
would
listen
to
a
funeral
the
blockade
is
now
universally
acknowledged
to
be
unobjectionable
this
estimate
is
borne
out
by
the
speech
for
the
government
by
the
who
maintained
the
effectiveness
of
the
blockade
and
who
answered
gregory
argument
that
recognition
was
not
in
question
by
stating
that
to
refuse
longer
to
recognize
the
blockade
would
result
in
a
situation
of
armed
neutrality
that
is
of
unproclaimed
war
he
pictured
the
disgust
of
europe
if
england
should
enter
upon
such
a
war
in
alliance
with
a
country
which
is
still
one
of
the
last
strongholds
of
slavery
an
admission
made
in
the
fervour
of
debate
that
was
dangerous
as
tending
to
tie
the
government
hands
in
the
future
but
which
was
no
doubt
merely
a
personal
and
carelessly
ventured
view
not
a
governmentally
authorized
one
in
general
the
most
interesting
feature
of
this
debate
is
the
hearty
approval
given
by
friends
of
the
north
to
the
entire
line
of
policy
and
conduct
in
relation
to
america
their
play
at
the
moment
feeling
insecure
as
to
the
fixity
of
governmental
policy
was
to
approve
heartily
the
neutrality
now
existing
and
to
make
no
criticisms
later
when
more
confident
of
the
permanency
of
british
neutrality
they
in
turn
became
critics
on
the
score
of
failure
in
specific
cases
in
neutral
duty
the
speech
showed
that
there
was
no
hope
for
the
motion
unless
it
could
be
made
a
party
question
of
that
there
was
no
indication
and
the
motion
was
withdrawn
three
days
later
a
similar
debate
in
the
lords
was
of
importance
only
as
offering
russell
since
he
was
now
a
member
of
the
upper
chamber
an
opportunity
to
speak
for
himself
lord
campbell
had
disavowed
any
intention
to
attack
the
blockade
since
russell
on
february
had
officially
approved
it
but
criticized
the
sending
to
lyons
of
the
despatch
itself
russell
upheld
the
strict
legality
and
effectiveness
of
the
blockade
stated
that
if
england
sided
with
the
south
in
any
way
the
north
would
appeal
to
a
slave
insurrection
the
first
reference
to
an
idea
which
was
to
play
a
very
important
rôle
with
russell
and
others
later
and
concluded
by
expressing
the
opinion
that
three
months
would
see
the
end
of
the
struggle
on
lines
of
separation
but
with
some
form
of
union
between
the
two
sovereignties
russell
speech
was
an
unneeded
but
emphatic
negative
of
the
effort
clearly
southern
sympathizers
had
committed
an
error
in
tactics
by
pressing
for
a
change
of
british
policy
the
rosy
hopes
of
mason
were
dashed
and
the
effect
of
the
efforts
of
his
friends
was
to
force
the
government
to
a
decided
stand
when
they
preferred
as
the
summons
of
spence
to
conference
makes
evident
to
leave
in
abeyance
for
a
time
any
further
declaration
on
the
blockade
the
refusal
of
mason
and
his
southern
friends
to
wait
compelled
a
governmental
decision
and
the
result
was
russell
instruction
to
lyons
of
february
the
effect
of
the
debate
on
mason
was
not
to
cause
distrust
of
his
english
advisers
but
to
convince
him
that
the
existing
government
was
more
determined
in
unfriendliness
than
he
had
supposed
of
the
blockade
he
wrote
no
step
will
be
taken
by
this
government
to
interfere
with
it
he
thought
the
military
news
from
america
in
part
responsible
as
the
late
reverses
at
fort
henry
and
fort
donelson
have
had
an
unfortunate
effect
upon
the
minds
of
our
friends
here
spence
was
opposed
to
any
further
move
in
parliament
until
some
more
definite
push
on
the
government
from
france
should
occur
slidell
anxiously
watching
from
paris
the
effort
in
england
had
now
altered
his
view
of
policy
and
was
convinced
there
was
no
hope
in
france
until
england
gave
the
signal
referring
to
his
previous
idea
that
the
continent
could
be
put
in
opposition
to
great
britain
on
the
blockade
he
wrote
i
then
supposed
that
the
influence
of
the
emperor
was
such
that
any
view
of
the
question
which
he
might
urge
on
the
british
cabinet
would
be
adopted
i
have
since
had
reason
to
change
entirely
this
opinion
i
am
now
satisfied
that
in
all
that
concerns
us
the
initiative
must
be
taken
by
england
that
the
emperor
sets
such
value
on
her
good
will
that
he
will
make
any
sacrifice
of
his
own
opinions
and
policy
to
retain
it
on
march
he
repeated
this
conviction
to
mason
it
was
a
correct
judgment
mason
was
thereby
exalted
with
the
knowledge
that
his
was
to
be
the
first
place
in
importance
in
any
and
all
operations
intended
to
secure
european
support
for
the
confederacy
but
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
the
first
steps
undertaken
in
that
direction
had
been
premature
from
this
first
failure
dated
his
fixed
belief
no
matter
what
hopes
were
sometimes
expressed
later
that
only
a
change
of
government
in
england
would
help
the
southern
cause

did

have
this

he

obvious
reasons
in
the
printed
paper
though
apparently
included
in
the
list
submitted
by
mason
these
figures
did
in
fact
but
reveal
a
situation
existing
even
after
the
american
blockading
fleets
had
to
be
created
from
all
sorts
of
available
material
and
were
slow
in
getting
under
way
regular
ships
of
the
old

not

it

too
few
in

and
also
at
first
directing
their
efforts
to
the
capture
of
shore
positions
which
would
render
a
large
blockading
squadron
unnecessary
this
proved
an
abortive
effort
and
it
was
not
until
that
the
development
of
a
large

was
seriously

the
friendly
atmosphere
created
by
the
lifting
of
the
threatening
episode
appears
to
have
made
secretary
seward
believe
that
the
moment
was
opportune
for
a
renewal
of
pressure
on
great
britain
and
france
for
the
recall
of
their
proclamations
of
neutrality
seizing
upon
the
victories
of
grant
at
forts
henry
and
donelson
he
wrote
to
adams
on
february
explaining
that
as
a
result
the
united
states
now
having
access
to
the
interior
districts
of
alabama
mississippi
and
arkansas
had
determined
to
permit
the
restoration
of
trade
upon
our
inland
ways
and
waters
under
certain
limitations
and
that
if
this
experiment
succeeded
similar
measures
would
be
applied
to
the
country
on
the
which
would
be
some
alleviation
of
the
rigour
of
the
blockade
he
added
that
these
concessions
to
foreign
nations
would
go
much
further
and
faster
if
those
nations
would
withdraw
their
belligerent
privileges
heretofore
so
unnecessarily
conceded
as
we
conceive
to
the
insurgents
this
was
large
talk
for
a
relatively
unchanged
military
situation
grant
had
as
yet
but
forced
open
the
door

was

from
having

districts
of

states
named
lyons
being
shown
a
copy
of
this
despatch
to
adams
commented
to
russell
that
while
it
might
be
said
the
position
and
the
spirit
of
the
northern
armies
were
greatly
improved
and
notable
successes
probable
it
could
not
be
maintained
that
hostilities
were
so
near
their
conclusion
or
are
carried
on
upon
so
small
a
scale
as
to
disqualify
either
party
for
the
title
of
belligerents
lyons
and
mercier
were
agreed
that
this
was
no
time
for
the
withdrawal
of
belligerent
rights
to
the
south
and
when
the
hint
was
received
that
the
purpose
of
making
such
a
request
was
in
seward
mind
the
news
quite
took
thouvenel
breath
away
as
yet
however
seward
did
no
more
than
hint
and
adams
was
quick
to
advise
that
the
moment
had
not
yet
come
when
such
a
proceeding
might
seem
to
me
likely
to
be
of
use
just
at
this
time
seward
was
engaged
in
forwarding
a
measure
no
doubt
intended
to
secure
british
sympathy
for
the
north
yet
also
truly
indicative
of
a
northern
temper
toward
the
south
and
its
domestic
institution
this
was
the
negotiation
of
a
treaty
with
great
britain
by
which
america
joined
at
last
the
nations
agreeing
to
unite
their
efforts
in
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
the
treaty
was
signed
by
seward
and
lyons
at
washington
on
april
on
the
next
day
seward
wrote
to
adams
that
had
such
a
treaty
been
ratified
in
there
would
now
have
been
no
sedition
here
and
no
disagreement
between
the
united
states
and
foreign
nations
a
melancholy
reflection
intended
to
suggest
that
the
south
alone
had
been
responsible
for
the
long
delay
of
american
participation
in
a
world
humanitarian
movement
but
the
real
purpose
of
the
treaty
lyons
thought
was
to
save
the
credit
of
the
president
with
the
party
which
elected
him
if
he
should
make
concessions
to
the
south
with
a
view
of
reconstructing
the
union
an
erroneous
view
evincing
a
misconception
of
the
intensity
of
both
northern
and
southern
feeling
if
regarded
from
our
present
knowledge
but
a
view
natural
enough
to
the
foreign
observer
at
the
moment
lyons
in
this
letter
correctly
stated
the
rising
determination
of
the
north
to
restore
the
union
but
underestimated
the
rapid
growth
of
an
equal
determination
against
a
restoration
with
slavery
the
real
motive
for
seward
eagerness
to
sign
the
slave
trade
treaty
was
the
thought
of
its
influence
on
foreign
not
domestic
affairs
lyons
being
confident
that
russell
would
approve
had
taken
the
risk
of
going
a
little
faster
than
his
instructions
had
indicated
in
this
same
letter
lyons
dwelt
upon
the
northern
elation
over
recent
military
successes
the
campaign
in
the
west
had
been
followed
in
the
east
by
a
great
effort
under
mcclellan
to
advance
on
richmond
up
the
peninsula
of
the
james
river
and
using
chesapeake
bay
as
a
means
of
water
transportation
and
supply
this
campaign
had
been
threatened
by
the
appearance
of
the
ram
and
her
attack
on
the
wooden
naval
vessels
operating
in
support
of
mcclellan
but
on
march
the
a
floating
fortress
drove
the
from
her
helpless
prey
and
removed
the
southern
threat
to
mcclellan
communications
more
than
any
other
one
battle
of
the
civil
war
the
duel
between
the
and
the
struck
the
imagination
of
the
british
people
and
justly
so
because
of
its
significance
in
relation
to
the
power
of
the
british
navy
it
has
been
the
main
talk
of
the
town
wrote
adams
ever
since
the
news
came
in
parliament
in
the
clubs
in
the
city
among
the
military
and
naval
people
the
impression
is
that
it
dates
the
commencement
of
a
new
era
in
warfare
and
that
great
britain
must
consent
to
begin
over
again
the
victory
of
the
was
relatively
unimportant
in
british
eyes
but
a
fight
between
two
completely
armoured
ships
and
especially
the
ease
with
which
the
had
vanquished
wooden
ships
on
the
day
previous
were
cause
of
anxious
consideration
for
the
future
russell
was
more
concerned
over
the
immediate
lessons
of
the
battle
only
think
he
wrote
of
our
position
if
in
case
of
the
yankees
turning
upon
us
they
should
by
means
of
iron
ships
renew
the
triumphs
they
achieved
in
by
means
of
superior
size
and
weight
of
metal
this
however
was
but
early
and
hasty
speculation
and
while
american
ingenuity
and
experiment
in
naval
warfare
had
indeed
sounded
the
of
wooden
ships
of
war
no
great
change
in
the
character
of
navies
was
immediately
possible
moreover
british
shipbuilders
could
surely
keep
pace
in
construction
with
america
or
any
other
nation
the
success
of
the
was
soon
regarded
by
the
british
government
as
important
mainly
as
indicative
of
a
new
energy
in
the
north
promising
further
and
more
important
successes
on
land
the
government
hoped
for
such
northern
success
not
because
of
any
belief
that
these
would
go
to
the
extent
of
forcing
the
south
into
submission
for
they
were
still
and
for
a
long
time
to
come
obsessed
with
the
conviction
that
southern
independence
must
ultimately
be
achieved
the
idea
was
rather
that
the
north
having
vindicated
its
fighting
ability
and
realizing
that
the
south
even
though
losing
battle
after
battle
was
stubborn
in
the
will
to
independence
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
game
was
not
worth
the
price
and
would
consent
to
separation
russell
wrote
in
this
vein
to
lyons
even
though
he
thought
that
the
morale
of
the
southern
army
seems
to
be
ruined
for
the
time
he
believed
that
the
end
of
the
war
would
be
hastened
by
northern
victories
and
he
therefore
rejoiced
in
them
of
somewhat
like
opinion
up
to
the
end
of
march
lyons
in
april
began
to
doubt
his
previous
analysis
of
northern
temper
and
to
write
warnings
that
the
end
was
not
near
grant
victory
in
the
west
at
shiloh
april
the
first
great
pitched
battle
of
the
war
called
out
such
a
flood
of
northern
expressions
of
determination
to
drive
the
war
to
the
bitter
end
as
to
startle
lyons
and
cause
him
in
a
remarkably
clear
letter
of
survey
to
recast
his
opinions
he
wrote
the
general
opinion
is
that
the
campaign
of
this
spring
will
clear
up
most
of
the
doubts
as
to
the
result
of
the
war
if
the
military
successes
of
the
north
continue
the
determination
of
the
south
will
it
is
asserted
be
at
last
really
put
to
the
test
if
notwithstanding
great
military
reverses
the
loss
of
the
border
states
and
the
occupation
of
the
most
important
points
on
the
coast
the
southern
men
hold
out
if
they
destroy
as
they
threaten
to
do
their
cotton
tobacco
and
all
other
property
which
can
not
be
removed
and
then
retire
into
the
interior
with
their
families
and
slaves
the
northern
conquests
may
prove
to
be
but
barren
the
climate
may
be
a
fatal
enemy
to
the
federal
armies
the
northern
people
may
be
unable
or
unwilling
to
continue
the
enormous
expenditure
they
may
prefer
separation
to
protracting
the
war
indefinitely
i
confess
however
that
i
fear
that
a
protraction
of
the
war
during
another
year
or
longer
is
a
not
less
probable
result
of
the
present
posture
of
affairs
than
either
the
immediate
subjugation
of
the
south
or
the
immediate
recognition
of
its
independence
this
itemization
of
southern
methods
of
resistance
was
in
line
with
confederate
threats
at
a
moment
when
the
sky
looked
black
there
was
indeed
much
southern
talk
of
retiring
into
a
hypothetical
defensible
interior
which
impressed
englishmen
but
had
no
foundation
in
geographical
fact
meanwhile
british
attention
was
eagerly
fixed
on
the
northern
advance
and
it
was
at
least
generally
hoped
that
the
projected
attack
on
new
orleans
and
mcclellan
advance
up
the
peninsula
toward
richmond
would
bring
to
a
more
definite
status
the
conflict
in
america
extreme
southern
sympathizers
scouted
the
possibility
of
any
conclusive
northern
success
ignoring
because
ignorant
the
importance
of
grant
western
campaign
they
were
quite
struck
aback
by
the
news
of
the
capture
of
new
orleans
april
it
took
them
three
days
to
make
up
their
minds
to
believe
it
but
even
the
capture
of
this
the
most
important
commercial
city
of
the
south
was
not
regarded
as
of
great
importance
in
view
of
the
eastern
effort
toward
richmond
news
of
the
operations
in
the
peninsula
was
as
slow
in
reaching
england
as
was
mcclellan
slow
and
cautious
advance
it
was
during
this
advance
and
previous
to
the
capture
of
new
orleans
that
two
remarkable
adventures
toward
a
solution
in
america
were
made
apparently
wholly
on
individual
initiative
by
a
frenchman
in
america
and
an
englishman
in
france
mercier
at
washington
and
lindsay
at
paris
conceived
quite
independently
that
the
time
had
come
for
projects
of
foreign
mediation
french
opinion
like
that
expressed
in
england
appears
to
have
been
that
the
northern
successes
in
the
spring
of
might
result
in
such
a
rehabilitation
of
northern
that
suggestions
of
now
recognizing
the
of
the
situation
and
acknowledging
the
independence
of
the
south
would
not
be
unfavourably
received
in
this
sense
thouvenel
wrote
to
mercier
privately
on
march
but
was
careful
to
state
that
the
word
mediation
ought
not
to
be
uttered
his
letter
dilated
also
on
french
manufacturing
difficulties
at
home
due
to
the
lack
of
cotton
this
was
in
no
way
an
instruction
to
mercier
but
the
ideas
expressed
were
broached
by
him
in
a
conversation
with
seward
only
to
be
met
with
such
positive
assertions
of
intention
and
ability
soon
to
recover
the
south
as
somewhat
to
stagger
the
french
minister
he
remarked
according
to
his
report
to
thouvenel
that
he
wished
it
were
possible
to
visit
richmond
and
assure
himself
that
there
also
they
recognized
the
truth
of
seward
statements
upon
which
the
latter
at
once
offered
to
further
such
a
trip
mercier
asserted
to
thouvenel
that
he
was
taken
by
surprise
having
foreseen
no
such
eager
acquiescence
in
a
suggestion
made
previous
but
that
on
consideration
he
returned
to
seward
and
accepted
the
proposal
outlining
the
substance
of
what
he
intended
to
say
at
richmond
he
should
there
make
clear
that
the
anxiety
of
france
was
above
all
directed
toward
peace
as
essential
to
french
commercial
interests
that
france
had
always
regarded
the
separation
of
north
and
south
with
regret
that
the
north
was
evidently
determined
in
its
will
to
restore
the
union
and
in
repetition
that
france
wished
to
aid
in
any
way
possible
the
early
cessation
of
war
seward
wrote
mercier
told
him
to
add
that
he
personally
would
welcome
the
presence
in
the
senate
of
any
persons
whom
the
south
wished
to
elect
mercier
writes
bancroft
from
the
first
had
been
an
impatient
sympathizer
with
the
confederacy
and
he
was
quite
devoid
of
the
balance
and
good
judgment
that
characterized
lord
lyons
quite
unnecessarily
seward
helped
him
to
make
the
trip
a
circumstance
apparently
not
known
to
bancroft
was
mercier
consultation
with
lyons
before
departure
in
which
were
revealed
an
initiative
of
the
adventure
and
a
proposed
representation
to
the
authorities
in
richmond
materially
different
from
the
report
made
by
mercier
to
thouvenel
these
merit
expanded
treatment
as
new
light
on
a
curious
episode
and
especially
as
revealing
the
british
policy
of
the
moment
represented
in
the
person
of
the
british
minister
in
washington
on
april
mercier
came
to
lyons
told
him
that
he
was
about
to
set
out
for
richmond
and
that
he
had
been
for
some
little
time
thinking
of
making
this
journey
he
told
of
the
suggestion
to
and
that
this
rather
to
his
surprise
had
been
eagerly
taken
up
monsieur
mercier
observed
that
the
object
of
vital
importance
to
france
and
to
england
also
as
he
supposed
was
to
put
an
end
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
blockade
and
generally
to
a
state
of
things
which
caused
so
grievous
an
interruption
of
the
trade
between
europe
and
this
country
it
was
he
said
possible
that
he
might
hasten
the
attainment
of
this
object
by
conferring
personally
with
the
secession
leaders
he
should
frankly
tell
them
that
to
all
appearances
their
cause
was
desperate
that
their
armies
were
beaten
in
all
quarters
and
that
the
time
had
arrived
when
they
ought
to
come
to
some
arrangement
which
would
put
an
end
to
a
state
of
affairs
ruinous
to
themselves
and
intolerable
to
europe
it
was
useless
to
expect
any
countenance
from
the
european
powers
those
powers
could
but
act
on
their
avowed
principles
they
would
recognize
any
people
which
established
its
independence
but
they
could
not
encourage
the
prolongation
of
a
fruitless
struggle
monsieur
mercier
thought
that
if
the
confederates
were
very
much
discouraged
by
their
recent
reverses
such
language
from
the
minister
of
a
great
european
power
might
be
a
blow
was
the
expression
he
used
to
them
it
might
induce
them
to
come
to
terms
with
the
north
at
all
events
it
might
lead
to
an
armistice
under
which
trade
might
be
immediately
resumed
he
had
he
told
me
mentioned
to
seward
his
notion
of
using
this
language
and
had
added
that
of
course
as
a
minister
accredited
to
the
united
states
and
visiting
richmond
with
the
consent
of
the
united
states
government
he
could
not
speak
to
the
southern
men
of
any
other
terms
for
ending
the
war
than
a
return
to
the
union
monsieur
mercier
proceeded
to
say
that
seward
entirely
approved
of
the
language
he
thus
proposed
to
hold
and
had
authorized
him
to
say
to
the
southern
leaders
not
of
course
from
the
united
states
government
but
from
him
seward
personally
that
they
had
no
spirit
of
vengeance
to
apprehend
that
they
would
be
cordially
welcomed
back
to
their
seats
in
the
senate
and
to
their
due
share
of
political
influence
seward
added
that
he
had
not
said
so
much
to
any
other
person
but
that
he
would
tell
monsieur
mercier
that
he
was
willing
to
risk
his
own
political
station
and
reputation
in
pursuing
a
conciliatory
course
towards
the
south
that
he
was
ready
to
make
this
his
policy
and
to
stand
or
fall
by
it
this
was
certainly
sufficiently
strong
language
to
have
pleased
the
american
secretary
of
state
and
if
actually
used
at
richmond
to
have
constituted
mercier
a
valuable
northern
agent
it
can
not
be
regarded
as
at
all
in
harmony
with
mercier
previous
opinions
nor
as
expressive
of
thouvenel
views
lyons
was
careful
to
refrain
from
much
comment
on
the
matter
of
mercier
proposed
representations
at
richmond
he
was
more
concerned
that
the
trip
was
to
be
made
at
all
was
in
fact
much
opposed
to
it
fearing
that
it
would
appear
like
a
break
in
that
unity
of
attitude
which
was
so
desirable
nor
was
he
without
suspicion
of
a
hidden
french
purpose
to
secure
some
special
and
separate
advantages
in
the
way
of
prospective
commercial
relations
with
the
south
mercier
told
lyons
that
he
knew
he
could
not
ask
lyons
to
accompany
him
because
of
american
extreme
susceptibility
to
any
interference
by
great
britain
but
he
thought
of
taking
stoeckl
the
russian
minister
and
that
stoeckl
was
pleased
with
the
idea
lyons
frankly
replied
that
he
was
glad
to
be
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
declining
to
go
and
was
sorry
mercier
was
determined
to
proceed
since
this
certainly
looked
like
a
break
in
joint
policy
and
he
objected
positively
on
the
same
ground
to
stoeckl
going
mercier
yielded
the
latter
point
but
argued
that
by
informing
seward
of
his
consultation
with
lyons
which
he
proposed
doing
the
former
objection
would
be
obviated
finding
that
mercier
was
bent
on
going
lyons
thought
it
best
not
to
object
too
much
and
confined
his
efforts
to
driving
home
the
idea
that
no
opening
should
be
given
for
a
separate
agreement
with
the
south
i
therefore
entered
with
him
into
the
details
of
his
plans
and
made
some
suggestions
as
to
his
language
and
conduct
i
said
that
one
delusion
which
he
might
find
it
desirable
to
remove
from
the
minds
of
men
in
the
south
was
that
it
would
be
possible
to
inveigle
france
or
any
other
great
european
power
into
an
exclusive
alliance
with
them
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
some
of
them
imagine
that
this
might
be
effected
by
an
offer
of
great
commercial
privileges
to
one
power
to
the
exclusion
of
others
i
hardly
supposed
that
jefferson
davis
himself
or
men
of
his
stamp
could
entertain
so
foolish
a
notion
but
still
it
might
be
well
to
eradicate
it
from
any
mind
in
which
it
had
found
place
lyons
saw
mercier
two
or
three
times
between
the
tenth
and
fourteenth
and
on
the
twelfth
spoke
to
seward
about
the
trip
without
saying
anything
to
lead
him
to
suppose
that
i
had
any
objection
to
it
this
was
intended
to
preserve
the
impression
of
close
harmony
with
france
and
lyons
wrote
i
consider
that
the
result
of
my
communications
with
mercier
entitles
him
to
say
that
he
makes
his
journey
to
richmond
with
my
acquiescence
nevertheless
he
both
believed
and
declared
to
mercier
that
the
views
expressed
on
southern
weakening
of
determination
were
wholly
erroneous
and
that
neither
north
nor
south
was
ready
for
any
efforts
still
less
mediation
looking
toward
peace
he
prophesied
failure
of
mercier
avowed
hopes
his
prophecy
proved
well
founded
on
april
lyons
reported
mercier
account
to
him
of
the
results
of
the
journey
mercier
returned
to
washington
on
april
reported
at
once
to
seward
the
results
of
his
trip
and
on
the
same
day
called
on
lyons
having
conversed
with
benjamin
the
new
confederate
secretary
of
state
he
was
now
wholly
convinced
of
the
settled
determination
of
the
south
to
maintain
its
independence
even
under
extreme
reverses
upon
enquiry
by
lyons
whether
the
south
expected
european
assistance
mercier
replied
that
the
confederate
leaders
professed
to
have
abandoned
all
hope
of
succour
from
europe
and
that
confident
in
their
own
power
they
desired
no
aid
cautiously
adverting
to
his
suspicion
that
mercier
trip
might
have
had
in
view
french
commercial
advantage
lyons
asked
whether
france
had
received
any
proposals
of
benefit
in
return
for
recognition
mercier
answered
with
a
simple
negative
he
then
further
developed
the
interview
with
benjamin
he
said
that
he
had
spoken
while
at
richmond
as
a
friend
of
the
union
and
a
friend
of
all
parties
but
that
the
particular
language
which
he
had
intended
to
hold
was
entirely
inapplicable
to
the
state
of
mind
in
which
he
found
the
confederates
one
and
all
it
was
idle
to
tell
them
that
they
were
worsted
on
all
sides
that
the
time
was
come
for
making
terms
with
the
north
what
he
had
said
to
them
about
the
recognition
of
their
independence
was
that
the
principal
inducement
to
france
to
recognize
it
would
be
a
hope
that
her
doing
so
would
have
a
great
moral
effect
towards
hastening
peace
that
at
this
moment
it
would
certainly
not
have
any
such
effect
that
it
would
embroil
france
with
the
united
states
and
that
would
be
all
thus
none
of
the
strong
representations
intended
to
be
made
by
mercier
to
convince
the
south
of
the
uselessness
of
further
resistance
had
in
fact
been
made
in
his
report
to
thouvenel
mercier
stated
that
he
had
approached
benjamin
with
the
simple
declaration
that
the
purpose
of
my
journey
was
merely
to
assure
myself
for
myself
of
the
true
condition
of
things
and
that
i
called
to
beg
him
to
aid
me
in
attaining
it
since
the
proposed
strong
representations
were
not
reported
to
thouvenel
either
in
the
explanation
given
of
the
initiation
of
the
trip
the
doubt
must
be
entertained
that
mercier
ever
intended
to
make
them
they
bear
the
appearance
of
arguments
to
seward
and
in
some
degree
also
to
lyons
made
to
secure
acquiescence
in
his
plan
the
report
to
thouvenel
omits
also
any
reference
to
expressions
as
narrated
to
lyons
about
recognition
of
the
confederacy
or
a
principal
inducement
thereto
mercier
now
declared
to
lyons
his
own
views
on
recognition
he
was
himself
more
than
ever
convinced
that
the
restoration
of
the
old
union
was
impossible
he
believed
that
if
the
powers
of
europe
exercised
no
influence
the
war
would
last
for
years
he
conceived
that
the
independence
of
the
south
must
be
recognized
sooner
or
later
and
in
his
opinion
the
governments
of
europe
should
be
on
the
watch
for
a
favourable
opportunity
of
doing
this
in
such
a
manner
as
to
end
the
war
the
present
opportunity
would
however
he
thought
be
particularly
unfavourable
lyons
writes
i
did
not
express
any
opinion
as
to
the
policy
to
be
eventually
pursued
by
france
or
england
but
i
told
monsieur
mercier
that
i
entirely
agreed
with
him
in
thinking
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
at
the
present
moment
but
to
watch
events
on
the
day
following
this
interview
lyons
spoke
to
seward
of
trip
and
was
given
a
very
different
view
of
the
situation
at
richmond
seward
said
he
himself
was
quite
convinced
from
monsieur
account
of
what
had
passed
that
the
confederates
were
about
to
make
a
last
effort
that
their
last
resources
were
brought
into
play
that
their
last
armies
were
in
the
field
if
they
were
now
defeated
they
would
accept
the
terms
which
would
be
offered
them
their
talking
of
retiring
into
the
interior
was
idle
if
the
united
states
were
undisputed
masters
of
the
border
states
and
the
sea
coast
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
any
more
fighting
those
who
chose
to
retire
into
the
interior
were
welcome
to
do
so
and
to
stay
there
till
they
were
tired
the
truth
wrote
lyons
as
to
the
state
of
feeling
in
the
south
probably
lies
somewhere
between
seward
views
and
those
of
monsieur
mercier
lyons
concluded
his
report
of
the
whole
matter
the
result
of
monsieur
mercier
journey
has
been
to
bring
him
back
precisely
to
the
point
at
which
he
was
three
months
ago
the
federal
successes
which
occurred
afterwards
had
somewhat
shaken
his
conviction
in
the
ultimate
success
of
the
south
and
consequently
his
opinions
as
to
the
policy
to
be
adopted
by
france
the
sentiments
he
now
expresses
are
exactly
those
which
he
expressed
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
other
words
mercier
was
now
again
pressing
for
early
recognition
of
the
south
at
the
first
favourable
moment
on
lyons
the
effect
of
the
adventure
to
richmond
was
just
the
reverse
of
this
and
on
russell
also
its
influence
was
to
cause
some
doubt
of
southern
success
appended
to
lyons
report
stands
russell
initialled
comment
it
is
desirable
to
know
what
is
the
interior
to
which
the
southern
confederates
propose
if
beaten
to
retire
if
in
arms
they
will
be
pursued
if
not
in
arms
their
discontent
will
cause
but
little
embarrassment
to
their
conquerors
but
can
the
country
be
held
permanently
by
the
armies
if
the
confederates
have
small
bodies
in
arms
resisting
the
authority
of
the
congress
any
facts
shewing
the
strength
or
weakness
of
the
union
feeling
in
the
south
will
be
of
great
value
in
forming
a
judgment
on
the
final
issue
seward
in
conversation
with
lyons
had
said
that
to
avoid
public
misconceptions
a
newspaper
statement
would
be
prepared
on
trip
this
appeared
may
in
the
new
york
the
paper
more
closely
seward
organ
than
any
other
throughout
the
war
representing
mercier
as
having
gone
to
richmond
by
order
of
napoleon
and
with
lincoln
approval
to
urge
the
confederates
to
surrender
and
to
encourage
them
to
expect
favourable
terms
lyons
commented
on
this
article
that
the
language
attributed
to
mercier
was
not
very
unlike
that
which
he
intended
to
hold
but
that
in
fact
he
had
not
used
it
nor
had
napoleon
ordered
the
move
indeed
everyone
in
london
and
paris
was
much
astonished
and
many
were
the
speculations
as
to
the
meaning
of
mercier
unusual
procedure
russell
was
puzzled
writing
que
diable
allait
il
faire
dans
cette
galére
and
cowley
at
paris
could
give
no
light
being
assured
by
thouvenel
on
first
rumours
of
mercier
trip
to
richmond
that
he
had
not
a
notion
that
this
could
be
true
may
cowley
wrote
the
whole
thing
is
inexplicable
unless
the
emperor
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
which
thouvenel
thinks
is
not
the
case
the
next
day
thouvenel
having
consulted
napoleon
was
assured
by
the
latter
that
he
could
not
account
for
monsieur
conduct
and
that
he
greatly
regretted
it
being
especially
disturbed
by
a
seeming
break
in
the
previous
complete
harmony
with
the
british
representative
at
washington
this
was
reassuring
to
russell
yet
there
is
no
question
that
mercier
conduct
long
left
a
certain
suspicion
in
british
official
circles
on
may
also
thouvenel
wrote
to
flahault
in
london
of
the
emperor
displeasure
evidently
with
the
intention
that
this
should
be
conveyed
to
russell
naturally
the
persons
most
excited
were
the
two
confederate
agents
in
europe
at
first
they
believed
mercier
must
have
had
secret
orders
from
napoleon
and
were
delighted
then
on
denials
made
to
slidell
by
thouvenel
they
feared
mercier
was
acting
in
an
unfavourable
sense
as
seward
agent
later
they
returned
to
the
theory
of
napoleon
private
manipulation
and
being
confident
of
his
friendship
were
content
to
wait
events
slidell
had
just
received
assurance
from
billault
through
whom
most
of
his
information
came
that
the
emperor
and
all
the
ministers
are
favourable
to
our
cause
have
been
so
for
the
last
year
and
are
now
quite
as
warmly
so
as
they
have
ever
been
thouvenel
is
of
course
excepted
but
then
he
has
no
hostility
but
a
greater
source
of
southern
hope
at
this
juncture
was
another
diplomatic
adventure
though
by
no
accredited
diplomat
which
antedated
mercier
trip
to
richmond
and
which
still
agitated
not
only
the
confederate
agents
but
the
british
ministry
as
well
this
was
the
appearance
of
the
british
member
of
parliament
lindsay
in
the
rôle
of
southern
emissary
to
napoleon
lindsay
as
one
of
the
principal
in
england
had
long
been
an
earnest
advocate
of
more
free
commercial
intercourse
between
nations
supporting
in
general
the
principles
of
cobden
and
bright
and
being
a
warm
personal
friend
of
the
latter
though
disagreeing
with
him
on
the
american
civil
war
he
had
been
in
some
sense
a
minor
expert
consulted
by
both
french
and
british
governments
in
the
preparation
of
the
commercial
treaty
of
so
that
when
on
april
he
presented
himself
to
cowley
asking
that
an
audience
with
the
emperor
be
procured
for
him
to
talk
over
some
needed
alterations
in
the
navigation
laws
the
request
seemed
reasonable
and
the
interview
was
arranged
for
april
on
the
twelfth
lindsay
reported
to
cowley
that
the
burden
of
conversation
much
to
his
surprise
was
on
american
affairs
the
emperor
said
lindsay
expressed
the
conviction
that
between
north
and
south
was
an
impossibility
and
declared
that
he
was
ready
to
recognize
the
south
if
great
britain
would
set
him
the
example
more
than
once
he
had
expressed
these
ideas
to
england
but
they
had
not
been
attended
to
and
he
should
not
try
again
he
continued
that
france
ought
not
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
the
united
states
but
that
the
united
states
ought
equally
to
abstain
from
all
interference
in
the
internal
concerns
of
france
and
that
his
majesty
considered
that
the
hindrance
placed
by
the
northern
states
upon
the
exportation
of
cotton
from
the
south
was
not
justifiable
and
was
tantamount
to
interference
with
the
legal
commerce
of
france
he
also
denied
the
efficiency
of
the
blockade
so
established
he
had
made
observations
in
this
sense
to
her
majesty
government
but
they
had
not
been
replied
to
then
his
majesty
asked
what
were
the
opinions
of
her
majesty
govt
adding
that
if
her
majesty
govt
agreed
with
him
as
to
the
inefficiency
of
the
blockade
he
was
ready
to
send
ships
of
war
to
with
others
of
her
majesty
to
keep
the
southern
ports
open
finally
napoleon
requested
lindsay
to
see
cowley
and
find
out
what
he
thought
of
these
ideas
cowley
told
lindsay
he
did
not
know
of
any
offer
whatever
having
been
made
by
france
to
england
that
his
cowley
opinion
was
that
it
might
be
true
that
the
north
and
the
south
would
never
but
that
it
was
not
yet
proved
that
the
efficiency
of
the
blockade
was
a
legal
and
international
question
and
that
upon
the
whole
it
had
been
considered
by
her
majesty
govt
as
efficient
though
doubtless
many
ships
had
been
enabled
to
run
it
and
that
at
all
events
there
could
not
be
a
more
inopportune
moment
for
mooting
the
question
both
of
the
recognition
of
the
south
and
of
the
efficiency
of
the
blockade
the
time
was
gone
by
when
such
measures
could
if
ever
have
been
taken
for
every
mail
brought
news
of
expeditions
from
the
north
acting
with
success
upon
the
south
and
every
day
added
to
the
efficiency
of
the
blockade
and
that
i
did
not
think
therefore
that
her
majesty
govt
would
consent
to
send
a
squadron
to
act
as
the
emperor
had
indicated
but
that
i
could
only
give
a
personal
opinion
which
might
be
corrected
if
i
was
in
error
by
lindsay
himself
seeing
lord
russell
on
april
a
second
interview
took
place
between
lindsay
and
napoleon
of
which
lindsay
reported
that
having
conveyed
to
napoleon
cowley
denial
of
any
offer
made
to
england
as
well
as
a
contrary
view
of
the
situation
napoleon
repeated
the
statement
that
two
long
despatches
with
his
opinion
had
been
written
to
de
flahault
which
had
not
been
attended
to
by
her
majesty
government
and
he
expressed
a
desire
that
lindsay
should
return
to
london
lay
his
majesty
views
before
lord
palmerston
and
lord
russell
and
bring
their
answers
direct
to
him
as
quickly
as
possible
his
majesty
observing
that
these
matters
were
better
arranged
by
private
than
official
hands
lindsay
said
that
he
had
promised
the
emperor
to
be
back
in
paris
on
thursday
morning
in
his
letter
to
russell
cowley
called
all
this
a
nasty
intrigue
cowley
had
asked
thouvenel
for
enlightenment
and
thouvenel
had
denied
all
knowledge
and
declared
that
certainly
no
such
proposals
as
lindsay
reported
the
emperor
to
have
mentioned
had
ever
been
sent
to
england
cowley
wrote
my
own
conviction
is
from
lindsay
conversations
with
me
which
are
full
of
hesitations
and
i
fear
much
falsehood
hidden
under
apparent
candour
that
he
has
told
the
emperor
his
own
views
and
that
those
views
are
supported
by
the
majority
of
the
people
of
england
and
by
the
present
opposition
in
parliament
who
would
denounce
the
blockade
if
in
power
that
he
has
found
a
willing
listener
in
the
emperor
who
would
gladly
obtain
cotton
by
any
means
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
lindsay
will
not
attempt
to
make
political
capital
of
his
interviews
with
the
emperor
with
the
opposition
and
that
you
may
hear
of
it
in
parliament
i
lose
no
time
therefore
in
writing
to
you
as
lindsay
goes
over
and
will
probably
endeavour
to
see
you
and
lord
palmerston
as
soon
as
possible
the
close
touch
between
lindsay
and
the
southern
agents
is
shown
by
his
conveyance
to
slidell
of
the
good
news
slidell
was
jubilant
writing
to
mason
lindsay
has
had
a
long
interview
with
the
emperor
who
is
prepared
to
act
at
once
decidedly
in
our
favour
he
has
always
been
ready
to
do
so
and
has
twice
made
representations
to
england
but
has
received
evasive
responses
he
has
now
for
the
third
time
given
them
but
in
a
more
decided
tone
lindsay
will
give
you
all
the
particulars
this
is
entirely
confidential
but
you
can
say
to
lord
campbell
gregory
that
i
now
have
positive
and
evidence
that
france
now
waits
the
assent
of
england
for
recognition
and
other
more
cogent
measures
two
days
later
slidell
made
a
report
to
benjamin
which
was
in
substance
very
similar
to
that
given
by
lindsay
to
cowley
though
more
highly
coloured
as
favourable
to
the
south
but
he
added
an
important
feature
which
as
has
been
seen
was
suspected
by
cowley
but
which
had
not
been
stated
to
him
napoleon
had
asked
lindsay
to
see
derby
and
disraeli
the
leaders
of
the
parliamentary
opposition
and
inform
them
of
his
views
a
suggestion
which
if
known
to
the
british
ministry
as
coming
from
napoleon
could
not
fail
to
arouse
resentment
slidell
even
believed
that
failing
british
participation
the
emperor
might
act
separately
in
recognition
of
the
south
april
cowley
having
received
privately
russell
approval
of
the
language
used
to
lindsay
and
believing
that
thouvenel
was
about
to
write
to
flahault
on
the
interviews
felt
it
necessary
to
bring
them
also
on
my
part
officially
to
your
russell
notice
this
official
report
does
not
differ
materially
from
that
in
cowley
private
letter
of
the
thirteenth
but
omitted
naturally
aspersions
on
lindsay
and
suspicions
of
the
use
to
which
he
might
put
his
information
cowley
had
held
a
long
conversation
with
thouvenel
in
which
it
was
developed
that
the
source
of
the
emperor
views
was
rouher
minister
of
commerce
who
was
very
anxious
over
the
future
of
cotton
supply
it
appeared
that
lindsay
in
conversation
with
thouvenel
had
affirmed
that
cowley
in
his
this
exasperated
cowley
and
he
resented
lindsay
unofficial
diplomacy
telling
thouvenel
that
he
was
placed
in
a
false
position
by
lindsay
interference
thouvenel
exclaimed
that
his
own
position
was
still
more
false
and
that
he
should
make
a
point
of
seeing
the
emperor
on
the
following
morning
and
of
ascertaining
the
extent
of
his
majesty
participation
in
the
proceeding
this
was
done
with
the
result
that
napoleon
acknowledged
that
on
lindsay
request
he
had
authorized
him
to
recount
to
russell
and
palmerston
the
views
expressed
but
asserted
that
he
had
not
charged
him
to
convey
those
opinions
cowley
concluded
his
despatch
monsieur
thouvenel
said
that
the
emperor
did
not
understand
the
intricacies
of
this
question
that
his
majesty
had
confounded
remarks
conveyed
in
despatches
with
deliberate
proposals
that
no
doubt
the
french
government
was
more
preoccupied
with
the
cotton
question
than
her
government
seemed
to
be
and
this
he
thouvenel
had
shewn
in
his
communications
with
de
flahault
but
that
he
knew
too
well
the
general
opinions
prevailing
in
england
to
have
made
proposals
nor
indeed
did
he
see
what
proposals
could
have
been
made
he
had
endeavoured
to
shew
both
the
emperor
and
rouher
that
to
recognize
the
independence
of
the
south
would
not
bring
cotton
into
the
markets
while
any
interference
with
the
blockade
would
probably
have
produced
a
collision
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
conceal
from
me
the
just
anxiety
he
experienced
to
reopen
the
cotton
trade
might
not
the
northern
states
be
induced
to
declare
some
one
port
neutral
at
which
the
trade
could
be
carried
on
i
said
that
the
events
which
were
now
passing
in
america
demonstrated
the
prudence
of
the
policy
pursued
by
the
two
governments
the
recognition
of
the
south
would
not
have
prevented
the
north
from
continuing
its
armaments
and
undertaking
the
expedition
now
in
progress
and
a
refusal
to
acknowledge
the
blockade
as
efficient
must
have
been
followed
by
the
employment
of
force
on
a
question
of
extreme
delicacy
formal
approval
was
given
cowley
by
russell
on
april
in
this
russell
stated
that
he
agreed
with
thouvenel
the
cotton
situation
was
alarming
but
he
added
the
evil
is
evident
not
equally
so
the
remedy
he
assured
cowley
that
her
majesty
government
wish
to
take
no
step
in
respect
to
the
civil
war
in
america
except
in
concert
with
france
and
upon
full
deliberation
meanwhile
lindsay
diplomatic
career
had
received
a
severe
jolt
in
london
confidently
addressing
to
russell
a
request
for
an
interview
he
received
the
reply
that
i
thought
the
best
way
for
two
govts
to
communicate
with
each
other
was
through
their
respective
embassies
he
lindsay
rejoined
that
he
feared
you
cowley
had
not
stated
the
reason
why
the
emperor
wished
to
make
the
proposal
through
him
rather
than
the
usual
channel
and
again
asked
to
see
me
but
i
declined
to
give
any
other
answer
adding
that
you
and
the
french
ambassr
could
make
the
most
confidential
as
well
as
official
communications
this
rebuff
was
not
regarded
as
final
though
exasperating
by
lindsay
nor
by
the
confederate
agents
all
being
agreed
that
napoleon
was
about
to
take
an
active
hand
in
their
favour
lindsay
returned
to
paris
accompanied
by
mason
and
on
april
had
still
another
conversation
with
napoleon
he
reported
russell
refusal
of
an
interview
and
that
he
had
seen
disraeli
but
not
derby
who
was
disraeli
had
declared
that
he
believed
russell
and
seward
to
have
a
secret
understanding
on
the
blockade
but
that
if
france
should
make
a
definite
proposal
it
would
probably
be
supported
by
a
majority
in
parliament
and
that
russell
would
be
compelled
to
assent
in
order
to
avoid
a
change
of
ministry
in
this
third
interview
with
lindsay
expressions
of
vexation
with
british
policy
were
used
by
napoleon
according
to
slidell
but
he
now
intimated
that
he
was
waiting
to
learn
the
result
of
the
northern
effort
to
capture
new
orleans
an
event
which
he
did
not
anticipate
but
which
if
it
occurred
might
render
it
inexpedient
to
act
evidently
the
wedge
was
losing
its
force
mason
returning
to
london
found
that
the
pulsations
in
paris
had
no
english
repetition
he
wrote
that
lindsay
failing
to
reach
russell
had
attempted
to
get
at
palmerston
but
with
no
success
thereupon
lindsay
turning
to
the
opposition
had
visited
disraeli
a
second
time
and
submitted
to
him
palmerston
rebuff
the
strongest
expression
that
fell
from
disraeli
was
if
it
is
found
that
the
emperor
and
russell
are
at
issue
on
the
question
the
session
of
parliament
would
not
be
as
quiet
as
had
been
anticipated
this
was
scant
encouragement
for
disraeli
if
was
all
important
yet
on
the
whole
lindsay
is
hopeful
wrote
mason
in
conclusion
within
a
fortnight
following
arrived
the
news
of
the
capture
of
new
orleans
an
event
upon
which
seward
had
postulated
the
relief
of
a
european
scarcity
of
cotton
and
to
southern
sympathizers
a
serious
blow
may
cowley
reported
that
the
emperor
had
told
him
personally
that
he
quite
agreed
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
for
the
moment
but
to
watch
events
thouvenel
asked
slidell
as
to
the
effect
of
the
loss
of
new
orleans
and
received
the
frank
answer
that
it
would
be
most
disastrous
as
it
would
give
the
enemy
the
control
of
the
mississippi
and
its
tributaries
but
that
it
would
not
in
any
way
modify
the
fixed
purpose
of
our
people
to
carry
on
the
war
even
to
an
extermination
mason
a
virginian
and
like
nearly
all
from
his
section
never
fully
realizing
the
importance
of
the
confederate
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
campaigns
about
richmond
was
telling
the
nervous
amongst
our
friends
that
new
orleans
would
form
a
barren
acquisition
to
the
enemy
and
will
on
our
side
serve
only
as
a
stimulant
if
the
south
needed
such
stimulants
she
was
certainly
getting
repeated
doses
in
the
three
months
from
february
to
may
in
england
lindsay
might
be
hopeful
of
a
movement
by
the
tory
opposition
but
thought
it
wiser
to
postpone
for
a
time
further
pressure
in
that
direction
may
henry
adams
could
write
to
his
brother
of
british
public
opinion
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
idea
here
is
as
strong
as
ever
that
we
must
ultimately
fail
but
on
may
that
the
effect
of
the
news
here
of
new
orleans
has
been
greater
than
anything
yet
the
came
out
and
gave
fairly
in
that
it
had
been
mistaken
it
had
believed
southern
accounts
and
was
deceived
by
them
this
morning
it
has
an
article
still
more
remarkable
and
intimates
for
the
first
time
that
it
sees
little
more
chance
for
the
south
there
is
we
think
a
preparation
for
withdrawing
their
belligerent
declaration
and
acknowledging
again
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
over
all
the
national
territory
to
be
absolute
and
undisputed
one
more
victory
will
bring
us
up
to
this
i
am
confident
this
was
mistaken
confidence
nor
did
governmental
reaction
keep
pace
with
southern
depression
or
northern
elation
the
british
ministry
was
simply
made
more
determined
to
preserve
strict
neutrality
and
to
restrain
its
french
partner
in
a
wait
for
events
policy
the
one
more
victory
so
eagerly
desired
by
henry
adams
was
not
forthcoming
and
the
attention
now
all
focused
on
mcclellan
campaign
waited
in
vain
for
the
demonstration
of
another
and
more
striking
evidence
of
northern
power
the
capture
of
the
confederate
capital
richmond
mcclellan
delays
coincided
with
a
bruiting
of
the
news
at
washington
that
foreign
powers
were
about
to
offer
mediation
this
was
treated
at
some
length
in
the
of
may
in
an
article
which
lyons
thought
inspired
by
seward
stating
that
mediation
would
be
welcome
if
offered
for
the
purpose
of
but
would
otherwise
be
resented
a
view
which
lyons
thought
fairly
represented
the
situation
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
this
washington
rumour
was
largely
the
result
of
the
very
positive
opinion
held
by
mercier
of
ultimate
southern
success
and
his
somewhat
free
private
communications
he
may
indeed
have
been
talking
more
freely
than
usual
exactly
because
of
anxiety
at
northern
success
for
mcclellan
so
far
as
was
then
known
was
steadily
if
slowly
progressing
toward
a
victory
mercier
most
recent
instruction
from
thouvenel
gave
him
no
authority
to
urge
mediation
yet
he
thought
the
moment
opportune
for
it
and
strongly
urged
this
plan
on
lyons
the
latter
summary
of
this
and
his
own
analysis
of
the
situation
were
as
follows
mercier
thinks
it
quite
within
the
range
of
possibility
that
the
south
may
be
victorious
both
in
the
battle
in
virginia
and
in
that
in
tennessee
he
is
at
all
events
quite
confident
that
whether
victorious
or
defeated
they
will
not
give
in
and
he
is
certainly
disposed
to
advise
his
government
to
endeavour
to
put
an
end
to
the
war
by
intervening
on
the
first
opportunity
he
is
however
very
much
puzzled
to
devise
any
mode
of
intervention
which
would
have
the
effect
of
reviving
french
trade
and
obtaining
cotton
i
should
suppose
he
would
think
it
desirable
to
go
to
great
lengths
to
stop
the
war
because
he
believes
that
the
south
will
not
give
in
until
the
whole
country
is
made
desolate
and
that
the
north
will
very
soon
be
led
to
proclaim
immediate
emancipation
which
would
stop
the
cultivation
of
cotton
for
an
indefinite
time
i
listen
and
say
little
when
he
talks
of
intervention
it
appears
to
me
to
be
a
dangerous
subject
of
conversation
there
is
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
mercier
anticipations
of
evil
but
i
do
not
see
my
way
to
doing
any
good
if
one
is
to
conjecture
what
the
state
of
things
will
be
a
month
or
six
weeks
hence
one
may
guess
that
mcclellan
will
be
at
richmond
having
very
probably
got
there
without
much
real
fighting
i
doubt
his
getting
farther
this
summer
if
so
far
the
campaign
will
not
be
pushed
with
any
vigour
during
the
summer
it
may
be
begun
again
in
the
autumn
thus
so
far
as
trade
and
cotton
are
concerned
we
may
be
next
autumn
just
in
the
situation
we
are
now
if
the
south
really
defeated
either
or
both
the
armies
opposed
to
them
i
think
it
would
disgust
the
north
with
the
war
rather
than
excite
them
to
fresh
efforts
if
the
armies
suffer
much
from
disease
recruiting
will
become
difficult
the
credit
of
the
government
has
hitherto
been
wonderfully
kept
up
but
it
would
not
stand
a
considerable
reverse
in
the
field
it
is
possible
under
such
circumstances
that
a
peace
party
might
arise
and
perhaps
just
that
england
and
france
might
give
weight
to
such
a
party
in
brief
lyons
was
all
against
either
intervention
or
mediation
unless
a
strong
reaction
toward
peace
should
come
in
the
north
and
even
then
regarded
the
wisdom
of
such
a
policy
as
only
just
nor
was
russell
inclined
to
depart
from
established
policy
he
wrote
to
lyons
at
nearly
the
same
time
the
news
from
york
town
new
orleans
and
corinth
seems
to
portend
the
conquest
of
the
south
we
have
now
to
see
therefore
whether
a
few
leaders
or
the
whole
population
entertain
those
sentiments
of
alienation
and
abhorrence
which
were
so
freely
expressed
to
mercier
by
the
confederate
statesmen
at
richmond
i
know
not
how
to
answer
this
question
but
there
are
other
questions
not
less
important
to
be
solved
in
the
north
will
the
abolitionists
succeed
in
proclaiming
freedom
to
the
slaves
of
all
those
who
have
resisted
i
guess
not
but
then
the
union
will
be
restored
with
its
old
disgrace
and
its
old
danger
i
confess
i
do
not
see
any
way
to
any
fair
solution
except
separation
but
that
the
north
will
not
hear
of
nor
in
the
moment
of
success
would
it
be
of
any
use
to
give
them
unpalatable
advice
two
days
preceding
this
letter
thouvenel
at
last
fully
informed
of
mercier
trip
to
richmond
instructed
him
that
france
had
no
intention
to
depart
from
her
attitude
of
strict
neutrality
and
that
it
was
more
than
ever
necessary
to
wait
events
mercier
renewed
efforts
to
start
a
movement
toward
mediation
were
then
wholly
personal
neither
france
nor
great
britain
had
as
yet
taken
up
this
plan
nor
were
they
likely
to
so
long
as
northern
successes
were
continued
in
london
mason
suffering
a
reaction
from
his
former
high
hopes
summed
up
the
situation
in
a
few
words
this
government
passive
and
ignorant
france
alert
and
mysterious
the
emperor
alone
knows
what
is
to
come
out
of
it
and
he
keeps
his
own
secret
the
southern
play
following
the
ministerial
rebuff
to
lindsay
was
now
to
keep
quiet
and
extended
even
to
discouraging
public
demonstrations
against
governmental
inaction
spence
had
prevented
such
a
demonstration
by
cotton
operators
in
liverpool
i
have
kept
them
from
moving
as
a
matter
of
judgment
if
either
of
the
southern
armies
obtain
such
a
victory
as
i
think
probable
then
a
move
of
this
kind
may
be
made
with
success
and
power
whilst
at
the
wrong
time
for
it
havoc
only
would
have
resulted
the
wrong
time
for
southern
pressure
on
russell
was
conceived
by
seward
to
be
the
right
time
for
the
north
immediately
following
the
capture
of
new
orleans
he
gave
positive
instructions
to
dayton
in
paris
and
adams
in
london
to
propose
the
withdrawal
of
the
declaration
admitting
southern
belligerent
rights
thouvenel
replied
with
some
asperity
on
the
folly
of
seward
demand
and
made
a
strong
representation
of
the
necessity
of
france
to
obtain
cotton
and
tobacco
adams
with
evident
reluctance
writing
i
had
little
expectation
of
success
but
i
felt
it
my
duty
at
once
to
execute
the
orders
advanced
with
russell
the
now
threadbare
and
customary
arguments
on
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
and
received
the
usual
refusal
to
alter
british
policy
if
seward
was
sincere
in
asking
for
a
retraction
of
belligerent
rights
to
the
south
he
much
mistook
european
attitude
if
he
was
but
making
use
of
northern
victories
to
return
to
a
high
tone
of
warning
to
europe
a
tone
serviceable
in
causing
foreign
governments
to
step
warily
his
time
was
well
chosen
certainly
at
washington
lyons
did
not
regard
very
seriously
renewal
of
demand
on
belligerency
satisfied
that
there
was
no
immediate
reason
to
require
his
presence
in
america
ill
and
fearing
the
heat
of
summer
he
had
asked
on
may
for
permission
to
take
leave
of
absence
for
a
trip
home
on
june
he
received
this
permission
evidence
that
russell
also
saw
no
cause
for
anxiety
and
on
june
he
took
leave
of
lincoln
i
had
quite
an
affectionate
parting
with
the
president
this
morning
he
told
me
as
is
his
wont
a
number
of
stories
more
or
less
decorous
but
all
he
said
having
any
bearing
on
political
matters
was
suppose
my
position
makes
people
in
england
think
a
great
deal
more
of
me
than
i
deserve
pray
tell
i
mean
no
harm
fully
a
month
had
now
elapsed
in
london
since
the
arrival
of
news
on
any
striking
military
event
in
america
new
orleans
was
an
old
story
and
while
in
general
it
was
believed
that
richmond
must
fall
before
mcclellan
army
the
persistence
of
southern
fervid
declarations
that
they
would
never
submit
gave
renewed
courage
to
their
british
friends
lindsay
was
now
of
the
opinion
that
it
might
be
wise
after
all
to
make
some
effort
in
parliament
and
since
the
washington
mediation
rumours
were
becoming
current
in
london
also
notice
was
given
of
a
motion
demanding
of
the
government
that
associating
itself
with
france
an
offer
of
mediation
be
made
to
the
contending
parties
in
america
motions
on
recognition
and
on
the
blockade
had
been
tried
and
had
failed
now
the
cry
was
to
be
peaceful
mediation
to
put
an
end
to
a
terrible
war
friends
of
the
south
were
not
united
in
this
adventure
spence
advised
lindsay
to
postpone
it
but
the
latter
seemed
determined
to
make
the
effort
probably
he
was
still
smarting
under
his
reverse
of
april
possibly
also
he
was
aware
of
a
sudden
sharp
personal
clash
between
palmerston
and
adams
that
might
not
be
without
influence
on
governmental
attitude
perhaps
might
even
indicate
a
governmental
purpose
to
alter
its
policy
this
clash
was
caused
by
a
personal
letter
written
by
palmerston
to
adams
on
the
publication
in
the
of
general
butler
famous
order
in
new
orleans
authorizing
federal
soldiers
to
treat
as
women
of
the
town
those
women
who
publicly
insulted
northern
troops
the
british
press
indulged
in
an
ecstasy
of
vicious
writing
about
this
order
similar
to
that
on
the
northern
barbarity
of
the
stone
fleet
episode
palmerston
letters
to
adams
and
the
replies
received
need
no
further
notice
here
since
they
did
not
in
fact
affect
british
policy
than
to
explain
that
palmerston
wrote
in
extreme
anger
apparently
and
with
great
violence
of
language
and
that
adams
replied
with
equal
anger
but
in
very
dignified
if
irritating
terms
in
british
opinion
order
was
an
incitement
to
his
soldiers
to
commit
atrocities
americans
understood
it
as
merely
an
authorization
to
return
insult
for
insult
in
fact
the
order
promptly
put
a
stop
to
attacks
on
northern
soldiers
whether
by
act
or
word
and
all
disorder
ceased
palmerston
was
quick
to
accept
the
british
view
writing
to
adams
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
express
adequately
the
disgust
which
must
be
excited
in
the
mind
of
every
honourable
man
by
the
general
order
of
general
butler
if
the
federal
government
chooses
to
be
served
by
men
capable
of
such
revolting
outrages
they
must
submit
to
abide
by
the
deserved
opinion
which
mankind
will
form
of
their
conduct
this
extraordinary
letter
was
written
on
june
adams
was
both
angry
and
perturbed
since
he
thought
the
letter
might
indicate
an
intention
to
change
british
policy
and
that
palmerston
was
but
laying
the
ground
for
some
vigorous
utterance
in
parliament
after
his
wont
when
striking
out
on
a
new
line
he
was
further
confirmed
in
this
view
by
an
editorial
in
the
on
june
hinting
at
a
coming
mediation
and
by
news
from
france
that
persigny
was
on
his
way
to
london
to
arrange
such
a
step
but
however
much
personally
aggrieved
adams
was
cool
as
a
diplomat
his
first
step
was
to
write
a
brief
note
to
palmerston
enquiring
whether
he
was
to
consider
the
letter
as
addressed
to
him
officially
or
purely
as
a
private
expression
of
sentiment
between
gentlemen
there
is
no
evidence
that
palmerston
and
russell
were
contemplating
a
change
of
policy
rather
the
reverse
but
it
does
appear
that
palmerston
wished
to
be
able
to
state
in
parliament
that
he
had
taken
adams
to
task
for
butler
order
so
that
he
might
meet
an
enquiry
already
placed
on
the
question
paper
as
to
the
ministry
intentions
in
the
matter
this
question
was
due
for
the
sitting
of
june
and
on
that
day
russell
wrote
to
palmerston
that
he
should
call
butler
order
brutal
and
that
palmerston
might
use
the
term
infamous
if
preferred
adding
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
represent
in
a
friendly
way
that
the
usages
of
war
do
not
sanction
such
conduct
this
was
very
different
from
the
tone
used
by
palmerston
his
letter
was
certainly
no
friendly
way
again
on
the
same
day
russell
wrote
to
palmerston
adams
has
been
here
in
a
dreadful
state
about
the
letter
you
have
written
him
about
butler
i
declined
to
give
him
any
opinion
and
asked
him
to
do
nothing
more
till
i
had
seen
or
written
to
you
what
you
say
of
butler
is
true
enough
tho
he
denies
your
interpretation
of
the
order
but
it
is
not
clear
that
the
president
approves
of
the
order
and
i
think
if
you
could
add
something
to
the
effect
that
you
respect
the
government
of
president
lincoln
and
do
not
wish
to
impute
to
them
the
fault
of
butler
it
might
soothe
him
if
you
could
withdraw
the
letter
altogether
it
would
be
the
best
but
this
you
may
not
like
to
do
it
is
apparent
that
russell
did
not
approve
of
palmerston
move
against
adams
nor
of
any
vigorous
language
in
parliament
and
as
to
the
last
he
had
his
way
for
the
government
while
disapproving
butler
order
was
decidedly
mild
in
comment
as
to
the
letter
adams
the
suspicion
proving
unfounded
that
an
immediate
change
of
policy
was
intended
returned
to
the
attack
as
a
matter
of
personal
prestige
it
was
not
until
june
that
palmerston
replied
to
adams
and
then
in
far
different
language
seeking
to
smooth
the
minister
ruffled
feathers
yet
making
no
apology
and
not
answering
adams
question
adams
promptly
responded
with
vigour
june
again
asking
his
question
as
to
the
letter
being
official
or
personal
and
characterizing
palmerston
previous
assertions
as
offensive
imputations
he
also
again
approached
russell
who
stated
that
he
too
had
written
to
palmerston
about
his
letter
but
had
received
no
reply
and
he
acknowledged
that
palmerston
proceeding
was
altogether
irregular
in
the
end
palmerston
was
brought
june
to
write
a
long
and
somewhat
rambling
reply
to
adams
in
effect
still
evading
the
question
put
him
though
acknowledging
that
the
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
is
the
regular
official
organ
for
communications
in
conclusion
he
expressed
gratification
that
reports
from
lord
lyons
showed
butler
authority
at
new
orleans
had
been
curtailed
by
lincoln
the
next
day
adams
answered
interpreting
palmerston
as
withdrawing
his
imputations
but
stating
plainly
that
he
would
not
again
submit
to
entertain
any
similar
correspondence
adams
had
been
cautious
in
pushing
for
an
answer
until
he
knew
there
was
to
be
no
change
in
british
policy
indeed
palmerston
whole
move
may
even
have
been
intended
to
ease
the
pressure
for
a
change
in
that
policy
on
the
very
day
of
adams
first
talk
with
russell
friends
of
the
south
thought
the
editorial
indicated
that
some
movement
is
to
be
made
at
last
and
i
doubt
not
we
are
to
thank
the
emperor
for
it
but
on
this
day
also
russell
was
advising
palmerston
to
state
in
parliament
that
we
have
not
received
at
present
any
proposal
from
france
to
offer
mediation
and
no
intention
at
present
exists
to
offer
it
on
our
part
this
was
the
exact
language
used
by
palmerston
in
reply
to
hopwood
mason
again
saw
his
hopes
dwindling
but
was
assured
by
lindsay
that
all
was
not
yet
lost
and
that
he
would
still
hold
his
motion
under
consideration
lindsay
according
to
his
own
account
had
talked
very
large
in
a
letter
to
russell
but
knew
privately
and
so
informed
mason
that
the
commons
would
not
vote
for
his
motion
if
opposed
by
the
government
and
so
intended
to
postpone
it
the
proposed
motion
was
now
one
for
recognition
instead
of
mediation
a
temporary
change
of
plan
due
to
palmerston
answer
to
hopwood
on
june
but
whatever
the
terms
of
the
motion
favourable
to
the
south
it
was
evident
the
government
did
not
wish
discussion
at
the
moment
and
hesitancy
came
over
friends
slidell
in
despair
declared
that
for
his
part
he
intended
no
matter
with
what
prospect
of
success
to
recognition
from
france
this
alarmed
mason
english
advisers
and
he
wrote
at
once
strongly
urging
against
such
a
step
for
if
the
demand
were
presented
and
refused
there
would
be
no
recourse
but
to
depart
for
home
he
thought
motion
dying
away
for
on
consultation
with
different
parties
including
disraeli
seymour
fitzgerald
and
roebuck
it
has
been
so
far
reduced
and
diluted
as
to
make
it
only
expressive
of
the
opinion
of
the
house
that
the
present
posture
of
affairs
in
america
made
the
question
of
the
recognition
of
the
confederate
states
worth
the
serious
consideration
of
the
government
it
was
so
modified
to
prevent
the
ministry
making
an
issue
upon
it
there
was
no
assurance
that
it
would
be
sustained
even
in
that
form
lindsay
had
determined
to
postpone
his
motion
for
a
fortnight
so
that
all
expectation
from
this
quarter
for
the
present
is
dished
and
we
must
wait
for
cotton
to
turn
the
screw
still
further
on
june
lindsay
gave
this
notice
of
postponement
and
no
parliamentary
comment
was
made
it
was
a
moment
of
extreme
depression
for
the
confederate
agents
in
europe
slidell
yielding
to
mason
pleas
gave
up
his
idea
of
demanding
recognition
and
wrote
the
position
of
our
representatives
in
europe
is
painful
and
almost
humiliating
it
might
be
tolerated
if
they
could
be
consoled
by
the
reflection
that
their
presence
was
in
any
way
advantageous
to
their
cause
but
i
am
disposed
to
believe
that
we
would
have
done
better
to
withdraw

wrote
lord
russell
sent
to
me
last
night
to
get
the
words
of
my
motion
i
have
sent
them
to
him
and
i
have
embraced
the
opportunity
of
opening
my
mind
to
his
lordship
i
have
told
him
that
i
have
postponed
my
motion
in
courtesy
to
him
that
the
sympathy
of
of
the
members
of
the
house
was
in
favour
of
immediate
recognition
and
that
even
if
the
government
was
not
prepared
to
accept
my
motion
a
majority
of
votes
might
have
been
obtained
in
its
favour
that
a
majority
of
votes
be
obtained
within
the
next
fortnight
and
i
expressed
the
most
earnest
hope
that
the
government
would
move
as
the
country
and
france
are
most
anxious
for
them
to
do
so
and
thus
prevent
the
necessity
of
any
private
member
undertaking
a
duty
which
belonged
to
the
executive
i
further
told
his
lordship
that
recognition
was
a
which
no
one
would
deny
us
the
form
of
exercising
that
the
fear
of
war
if
we
exercised
it
was
a
delusion
that
the
majority
of
the
leading
men
in
the
northern
states
would
thank
us
for
exercising
it
and
that
even
seward
himself
might
be
glad
to
see
it
exercised
so
as
to
give
him
an
excuse
for
getting
out
of
the
terrible
war
into
which
he
had
dragged
his
people
i
further
said
that
if
the
question
is
settled
our
recognition
of
the
south
he
might
that
the
northern
armies
be
marched
into
canada
i
hope
my
note
may
produce
the
desired
results
and
thus
get
the
government
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
for
i
saw
that
the
house
was
not
prepared
to
vote
and
the
question
is
far
too
grave
to
waste
time
upon
it
in
idle
talk
even
if
talk
without
action
did
no
harm

for
two
weeks
there
was
no
lightening
of
southern
depression
in
england
but
on
june
mcclellan
had
been
turned
back
from
his
advance
on
richmond
by
lee
the
new
commander
of
the
army
of
virginia
and
the
much
heralded
peninsular
campaign
was
recognized
to
have
been
a
disastrous
failure
earlier
northern
victories
were
forgotten
and
the
campaigns
in
the
west
still
progressing
favourably
for
the
north
were
ignored
or
their
significance
not
understood
again
to
english
eyes
the
war
in
america
approached
a
stalemate
the
time
had
come
with
the
near
adjournment
of
parliament
when
if
ever
a
strong
southern
effort
must
be
made
and
the
time
seemed
propitious
moreover
by
july
it
was
hoped
that
soon
in
the
cotton
districts
the
depression
steadily
increasing
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
would
bring
an
ally
to
the
southern
cause
before
continuing
the
story
of
parliamentary
and
private
efforts
by
the
friends
of
the
south
it
is
here
necessary
to
review
the
cotton
situation
now
rapidly
becoming
a
matter
of
anxious
concern
to
both
friend
and
foe
of
the
north
and
in
less
degree
to
the
ministry
itself
king
cotton
had
long
been
a
boast
with
the
south
perhaps
no
great
revolution
says
bancroft
was
ever
begun
with
such
convenient
and
soothing
theories
as
those
that
were
expounded
and
believed
at
the
time
of
the
organization
of
the
confederacy
in
any
case
hostilities
could
not
last
long
for
france
and
great
britain
must
have
what
the
confederacy
alone
could
supply
and
therefore
they
could
be
forced
to
aid
the
south
as
a
condition
precedent
to
relief
from
the
terrible
distress
that
was
sure
to
follow
a
blockade
this
confidence
was
no
new
development
for
ten
years
past
whenever
southern
threats
of
secession
had
been
indulged
in
the
writers
and
politicians
of
that
section
had
expanded
upon
cotton
as
the
one
great
industry
of
america
and
as
the
one
product
which
would
compel

two
years
later
writing
before
the
elections
of
in
which
the
main
question
was
that
of
the
territorial
expansion
of
slavery
this
same
southern
statesman
expressed
himself
as
believing
that
the
south
is
now
the
controlling
power
of
the
world
cotton
rice
tobacco
and
naval
stores
command
the
world
and
we
have
sense
enough
to
know
it
and
are
sufficiently
teutonic
to
carry
it
out
successfully
these
quotations
indicative
of
southern
faith
in
cotton
might
be
amplified
and
repeated
from
a
hundred
sources
moreover
this
faith
in
the
possession
of
ultimate
power
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
conviction
that
the
south
more
than
any
other
quarter
of
the
world
produced
to
the
benefit
of
mankind
in
the
three
million
bags
of

than
all
the

of

old

will

in

slavery
is
the
backbone
of
the
northern
commercial
as
it
is
of
the
british
manufacturing
system
nor
was
this
idea
unfamiliar
to
englishmen
before
the
civil
war
was
under
way
charles
greville
wrote
to
clarendon
any
war
will
be
almost
sure
to
interfere
with
the
cotton
crops
and
this
is
really
what
affects
us
and
what
we
care
about
with
all
our
virulent
abuse
of
slavery
and
and
our
continual
on
that
subject
we
are
just
as
anxious
for
and
as
much
interested
in
the
prosperity
of
the
slavery
interest
in
the
southern
states
as
the
carolinan
and
georgian
planters
themselves
and
all
lancashire
would
deplore
a
successful
insurrection
of
the
slaves
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
on
december
south
carolina
led
the
march
in
secession
fifteen
days
earlier
the
british
consul
at
charleston
bunch
reported
a
conversation
with
rhett
long
a
leader
of
the
southern
cause
and
now
a
consistent
advocate
of
secession
in
which
rhett
developed
a
plan
of
close
commercial
alliance
with
england
as
the
most
favoured
nation
postulating
the
dependence
of
great
britain
on
the
south
for
cotton
upon
which
supposed
axiom
i
would
remark
wrote
bunch
all
their
calculations
are
based
such
was
indeed
southern
calculation
in
january
bow
contained
an
article
declaring
that
the
first
demonstration
of
blockade
of
the
southern
ports
would
be
swept
away
by
the
english
fleets
of
observation
hovering
on
the
southern
coasts
to
protect
english
commerce
and
especially
the
free
flow
of
cotton
to
english
and
french
factories
a
stoppage
of
the
raw
material
would
produce
the
most
disastrous
political
results
if
not
a
revolution
in
england
this
is
the
language
of
english
statesmen
manufacturers
and
merchants
in
parliament
and
at
cotton
associations
debates
and
it
discloses
the
truth
the
historical
student
will
find
but
few
such
british
utterances
at
the
moment
and
these
few
not
by
men
of
great
weight
either
in
politics
or
in
commerce
the
south
was
labouring
under
an
obsession
and
prophesied
results
accordingly
so
strong
was
this
obsession
that
governmental
foreign
policy
neglected
all
other
considerations
and
the
first
commission
to
europe
had
no
initial
instructions
save
to
demand
recognition
the
failure
of
that
commission
the
prompt
british
acquiescence
in
the
blockade
were
harsh
blows
to
southern
confidence
but
did
not
for
a
long
time
destroy
the
faith
in
the
power
of
cotton
in
june
bunch
wrote
that
there
was
still
a
firm
belief
that
great
britain
will
make
any
sacrifice
even
of
principle
or
of
honour
to
prevent
the
stoppage
of
the
supply
of
cotton
and
he
enclosed
a
copy
of
an
article
in
the
of
june
proclaiming
the
cards
are
in
our
hands
and
we
intend
to
play
them
out
to
bankruptcy
of
every
cotton

in
great
britain
and
france
or
the
acknowledgment
of

late
as

was
still
writing
of
this
southern
faith
in

and
described
the

of

due
to

fact
that
he

it
was
not
until
the

of
undoubted
hardships
caused
by

his
earlier
criticisms
of

foreign
policy
said

england
to
her
knees
the
idea
was
ludicrous
enough
that
england
and
france
would
instinctively
or
readily
fling
themselves
into
a
convulsion
which
their
great
politicians
saw
was
the
most
tremendous
one
of
modern
times
but
the
puerile
argument
which
even
president
davis
did
not
hesitate
to
adopt
about
the
power
of
cotton
amounted
to
this
absurdity
that
the
great
and
illustrious
power
of
england
would
submit
to
the
ineffable
humiliation
of
acknowledging
its
dependency
on
the
infant
confederacy
of
the
south
and
the
subserviency
of
its
empire
its
political
interests
and
its
pride
to
a
single
article
of
trade
that
was
grown
in
america
but
irrespective
of
the
extremes
to
which
southern
confidence
in
cotton
extended
the
actual
hardships
of
england
were
in
all
truth
serious
enough
to
cause
grave
anxiety
and
to
supply
an
argument
to
southern
sympathizers
the
facts
of
the
lancashire
cotton
famine
have
frequently
been
treated
by
historians
at
much
length
and
need
here
but
a
general
review
more
needed
is
an
examination
of
some
of
the
erroneous
deductions
drawn
from
the
facts
and
especially
an
examination
of
the
extent
to
which
the
question
of
cotton
supply
affected
or
determined
british
governmental
policy
toward
america
english
cotton
manufacturing
in
held
a
position
of
importance
equalled
by
no
other
one
industry
estimates
based
on
varying
statistics
diverge
as
to
exact
proportions
but
all
agree
in
emphasizing
the
place
of
lancashire
in
determining
the
general
prosperity
of
the
nation
surveying
the
english
not
the
whole
british
situation
it
is
estimated
that
there
were
factories
of
which
were
in
lancashire
and
two
adjacent
counties
these
employed
operatives
and
consumed
a
thousand
million
pounds
of
cotton
each
year
an
editorial
in
the
september
stated
that
of
the
entire
english
population
was
held
to
be
dependent
either
directly
or
indirectly
on
the
prosperity
of
the
cotton
districts
and
therefore
also
dependent
on
the
source
of
supply
the
confederate
south
since
statistics
though
varying
showed
that
the
raw
cotton
supplied
from
america
constituted
anywhere
from
to
per
cent
of
the
total
english
importation
the
american
crop
of
was
the
largest
on
record
nearly
bales
and
the
foreign
shipments
without
question
hurried
because
of
the
rising
at
home
had
been
practically
completed
by
april
of
the
bales
sent
abroad
liverpool
as
usual
received
the
larger
portion
there
was
then
no
immediate
shortage
of
supply
when
war
came
in
america
rather
an
unusual
accumulation
of
raw
stocks
even
permitting
some
reshipment
to
the
northern
manufacturing
centres
of
america
where
the
scarcity
then
brought
high
prices
in
addition
from
december
to
at
least
april
there
had
been
somewhat
of
a
slump
in
demand
for
raw
cotton
by
british
manufacturers
due
to
an
of
goods
in
the
two
previous
years
there
had
been
a
temporary
depression
in
caused
by
a
general
financial
crisis
but
early
in
restored
confidence
and
a
tremendous
demand
from
the
far
east
india
especially
set
the
mills
running
again
on
full
time
while
many
new
mills
were
brought
into
operation
but
by
may
the
mills
had
caught
up
with
the
heavy
demands
and
the
rest
of
the
year
saw
uncertainty
of
operations
and
brought
expressions
of
fear
that
the
plunge
to
produce
had
been
overdone
manufactured
stocks
began
to
accumulate
and
money
was
not
easy
since
brought
also
a
combination
of
events
deficient
grain
harvest
at
home
withdrawal
of
gold
from
england
to
france
for
investment
in
french
public
works
demand
of
america
for
gold
in
place
of
goods
due
to
political
uncertainties
there
which
rapidly
raised
the
discount
rate
from
two
and
one
half
per
cent
in
january
to
six
in
december
by
the
end
of
april
the
board
of
trade
returns
indicated
that
the
cotton
trade
was
in
a
dangerous
situation
with
large
imports
of
raw
cotton
and
decreased
exports
of
goods
the
news
of
war
actually
begun
in
america
came
as
a
temporary
relief
to
the
english
cotton
trade
and
in
the
prospect
of
decreased
supply
prices
rose
saving
many
manufacturers
from
impending
difficulties
a
few
mills
had
already
begun
to
work
on
because
of
trade
depression
the
effect
of
lincoln
blockade
proclamation
was
to
check
this
movement
but
by
october
it
had
again
begun
and
this
time
because
of
the
rapid
increase
in
the
price
of
raw
cotton
as
compared
with
the
slower
advance
of
the
price
of
goods
in
substance
the
principal
effect
of
the
war
on
the
english
cotton
trade
for
the
first
seven
or
eight
months
was
felt
not
in
the
manufacturing
districts
but
in
the
liverpool
speculative
and
importing
markets
of
raw
cotton
prices
rose
steadily
to
over
a
shilling
a
pound
in
october
on
november
there
was
a
near
panic
caused
by
rumours
of
british
intervention
these
were
denounced
as
false
and
in
five
days
the
price
was
back
above
its
previous
figure
then
on
november
came
the
news
of
the
and
the
market
was
thrown
into
confusion
not
because
of
hopes
that
cotton
would
come
more
freely
but
in
fear
that
war
with
america
would
cause
it
to
do
so
the
liverpool
speculators
breathed
freely
again
only
when
peace
was
assured
this
speculative
british
interest
was
no
cause
for
serious
governmental
concern
and
could
not
affect
policy
but
the
manufacturing
trade
was
presumably
a
more
serious
anxiety
and
if
cotton
became
hard
or
even
impossible
to
obtain
a
serious
situation
would
demand
consideration
in
the
generally
accepted
view
of
a
short
war
there
was
at
first
no
great
anticipation
of
real
danger
but
beginning
with
december
there
was
almost
complete
stoppage
of
supply
from
america
in
the
six
months
to
the
end
of
may
but
bales
were
received
less
than
one
per
cent
of
the
amount
for
the
same
six
months
of
the
previous
year
the
blockade
was
making
itself
felt
and
not
merely
in
shipments
from
the
south
but
in
prospects
of
southern
production
for
the
news
came
that
the
negroes
were
being
withdrawn
by
their
masters
from
the
rich
sea
islands
along
the
coast
in
fear
of
their
capture
by
the
northern
blockading
squadrons
such
a
situation
seemed
bound
in
the
end
to
result
in
pressure
by
the
manufacturers
for
governmental
action
to
secure
cotton
that
it
did
not
immediately
do
so
is
explained
by
arnold
whose
dictum
has
been
quite
generally
accepted
as
follows
the
immediate
result
of
the
american
war
was
at
this
time
to
relieve
the
english
cotton
trade
including
the
dealers
in
the
raw
material
and
the
producers
and
dealers
in
manufactures
from
a
serious
and
impending
difficulty
they
had
in
hand
a
stock
of
goods
sufficient
for
the
consumption
of
of
a
year
therefore
a
rise
in
the
price
of
the
raw
material
and
the
partial
closing
of
their
establishments
with
a
curtailment
of
their
working
expenses
was
obviously
to
their
advantage
but
to
make
their
success
complete
this
rise
in
the
price
of
cotton
was
upon
the
largest
stock
ever
collected
in
the
country
at
this
season
to
the
cotton
trade
there
came
in
these
days
an
unlooked
for
accession
of
wealth
such
as
even
it
had
never
known
before
in
place
of
the
hard
times
which
had
been
anticipated
and
perhaps
deserved
there
came
a
shower
of
riches
this
was
written
of
the
situation
in
december
a
similar
analysis
no
doubt
on
the
explanations
offered
by
his
english
friends
of
the
question
of
cotton
supply
which
we
had
supposed
would
speedily
have
disturbed
the
level
of
their
neutral
policy
was
made
by
mason
in
march
thus
he
concluded
it
is
that
even
in
lancashire
and
other
manufacturing
districts
no
open
demonstration
has
been
made
against
the
blockade
manufactures
other
than
cotton
were
greatly
prospering
in
particular
those
of
woollen
flax
and
iron
and
the
theory
that
the
cotton
lords
were
not
in
reality
hit
by
the
blockade
perhaps
profited
by
it
was
bruited
even
during
the
war
october
held
this
view
while
the
of
may
went
to
the
extent
of
describing
the
glut
of
goods
in
relieved
just
in
the
nick
of
time
by
the
war
preventing
a
financial
crash
which
must
sooner
or
later
have
caused
great
suffering
in
lancashire
arnold
generalization
has
been
taken
to
prove
that
the
effect
of
the
civil
war
was
to
save
the
cotton
industry
from
great
disaster
and
that
there
resulted
large
profits
to
the
manufacturers
from
the
increased
price
of
stocks
on
hand
in
fact
his
description
of
the
situation
in
december
as
his
own
later
pages
show
was
not
applicable
so
far
as
manufacturers
profits
are
concerned
until
the
later
months
of
and
the
first
of
for
though
prices
might
be
put
up
as
they
were
goods
were
not
sold
in
any
large
quantities
before
the
fall
of
there
were
almost
no
transactions
for
shipments
to
america
china
or
the
indies
foreign
purchasers
as
always
and
especially
when
their
needs
had
just
been
abundantly
supplied
by
the
great
output
of
were
not
keen
to
place
new
orders
in
a
rising
and
uncertain
market
the
english
producers
raised
their
prices
but
they
held
their
goods
lacking
an
effective
market
the
importance
of
this
in
british
foreign
policy
is
that
at
no
time
until
the
accumulated
goods
were
disposed
of
was
there
likely
to
be
any
trade
eagerness
for
a
british
intervention
in
america
their
only
fear
says
arnold
was
the
sudden
opening
of
southern
ports
and
a
rush
of
raw
cotton
a
sneer
called
out
by
the
alleged
great
losses
incurred
and
patriotically
borne
in
silence
certainly
in
parliament
the
members
from
lancashire
gave
no
sign
of
discontent
with
the
government
policy
of
neutrality
for
in
the
various
debates
on
blockade
mediation
and
cotton
supply
but
one
member
from
lancashire
hopwood
ever
spoke
in
favour
of
a
departure
from
neutrality
or
referred
to
the
distress
in
the
manufacturing
districts
as
due
to
any
other
cause
than
the
shortage
in
cotton
caused
by
the
war
but
it
was
far
otherwise
with
the
operatives
of
lancashire
whatever
the
causes
of
operation
in
the
mills
or
of
total
cessation
of
work
the
situation
was
such
that
from
october
more
and
more
operatives
were
thrown
out
of
employment
as
their
little
savings
disappeared
they
were
put
upon
public
poor
relief
or
upon
private
charity
for
subsistence
the
governmental
statistics
do
not
cover
accurately
the
relief
offered
by
private
charity
but
those
of
public
aid
well
indicate
the
loss
of
opportunity
in
the
distressed
districts
of
lancashire
and
the
adjoining
counties
it
appears
that
poor
relief
was
given
to
persons
in
normal
times
out
of
a
total
population
of
in
the
first
week
of
november
it
was
and
for
the
first
week
of
december
thereafter
mounting
steadily
until
march
when
a
temporary
peak
of
was
reached
from
march
until
the
first
week
in
june
there
was
a
slight
decrease
but
from
the
second
week
of
june
poor
relief
resumed
an
upward
trend
increasing
rapidly
until
december
when
it
reached
its
highest
point
of
in
this
same
first
week
of
december
private
relief
now
thoroughly
organized
in
a
great
national
effort
was
extended
to
people
making
a
grand
total
at
high
tide
of
distress
of
over
persons
if
private
relief
was
not
extended
to
those
receiving
public
funds
but
of
this
differentiation
there
is
no
surety
indeed
there
are
evidences
of
much
duplication
of
effort
in
certain
districts
in
general
however
these
statistics
do
exhibit
the
great
lack
of
employment
in
a
district
heretofore
enjoying
unusual
prosperity
the
manufacturing
operative
population
of
the
district
was
estimated
at
between
and
at
the
time
of
greatest
distress
some
of
these
were
receiving
either
public
or
private
aid
though
many
were
working
in
the
mills
or
were
engaged
on
public
enterprises
set
on
foot
to
ease
the
crisis
but
there
was
no
starvation
and
it
is
absurd
to
compare
the
crisis
to
the
irish
famine
of
the
this
was
a
famine
in
the
shortage
of
that
commodity
but
it
was
not
a
famine
the
country
wrote
john
bright
was
passing
through
a
terrible
crisis
but
our
people
will
be
kept
alive
by
the
contributions
of
the
country
nevertheless
a
rapid
change
from
a
condition
of
adequate
to
one
of
dependence
on
charity
a
change
ultimately
felt
by
the
great
bulk
of
those
either
directly
or
indirectly
dependent
upon
the
cotton
industry
might
have
been
expected
to
arouse
popular
demonstrations
to
force
governmental
action
directed
to
securing
cotton
that
trade
might
revive
that
no
such
popular
effect
was
made
demands
careful
analysis
to
be
offered
in
a
later
chapter
but
here
the
is
alone
important
and
the
fact
was
that
the
operatives
sympathized
with
the
north
and
put
no
pressure
on
the
cabinet
thus
at
no
time
during
the
war
was
there
any
attempt
from
lancashire
whether
of
manufacturers
or
operatives
to
force
a
change
of
governmental
policy
as
the
lack
of
employment
developed
in
lancashire
public
discussion
and
consideration
were
inevitably
aroused
but
there
was
little
talk
of
governmental
interference
and
such
as
did
appear
was
promptly
met
with
opposition
by
the
leading
trade
journals
july
the
viewed
the
cotton
shortage
as
a
and
an
one
we
have
on
our
hypothesis
to
provide
against
the
stoppage
of
our
supply
for
year
and
that
the
very
year
would
it
asked
bright
to
break
the
blockade
i
do
think
myself
it
would
be
cheap
at
the
cost
of
a
war
with
the
united
states
this
was
also
the
notion
of
the
london
which
while
acknowledging
that
the
of
england
and
france
were
about
to
be
greatly
embarrassed
continued
we
are
not
going
to
add
to
the
difficulty
by
involving
ourselves
in
a
naval
war
with
the
northern
the
commented
in
substance
in
several
issues
in
september
on
the
wise
policy
of
working
as
a
precaution
against
the
contingencies
of
the
cotton
supply
and
of
the
glutted
state
of
distant
markets
for
manufactured
goods
october
the
acknowledged
that
the
impatience
of
some
was
quite
understandable
as
was
talk
of
a
european
compulsion
on
america
to
stop
an
objectless
and
hopeless
quarrel
but
then
entered
upon
an
elaborate
discussion
of
the
principles
involved
and
demonstrated
why
england
ought
not
to
intervene
in
november
bright
could
write
the
notion
of
getting
cotton
by
interfering
with
the
blockade
is
abandoned
apparently
by
the
simpletons
who
once
entertained
it
and
it
is
accepted
now
as
a
fixed
policy
that
we
are
to
take
no
part
in
your
difficulties
throughout
the
fall
of
the
was
doing
its
best
to
quiet
apprehensions
urging
that
due
to
the
glut
of
manufactured
goods
must
have
ensued
anyway
pointing
out
that
now
an
advanced
price
was
possible
and
arguing
that
here
was
a
situation
likely
to
result
in
the
development
of
other
sources
of
supply
with
an
escape
from
the
former
dependence
on
america
in
view
of
the
actual
conditions
of
the
trade
already
recounted
these
were
appealing
arguments
to
the
larger
manufacturers
but
the
small
mills
running
on
short
order
supplies
and
with
few
stocks
of
goods
on
hand
were
less
easily
convinced
they
were
however
without
parliamentary
influence
and
hence
negligible
as
affecting
public
policy
at
the
opening
of
the
new
year
bright
declared
that
with
the
spinners
and
manufacturers
and
merchants
i
think
generally
there
is
no
wish
for
any
change
bright
letter
of
november
was
written
before
news
of
the
reached
england
that
of
january
just
after
that
controversy
had
been
amicably
settled
the
had
both
diverted
attention
from
cotton
and
in
its
immediate
result
created
a
general
determination
to
preserve
neutrality
it
is
evident
that
even
without
this
threat
of
war
there
was
no
real
cotton
pressure
upon
the
government
with
northern
successes
in
the
spring
of
hopes
were
aroused
that
the
war
would
soon
end
or
that
at
least
some
cotton
districts
would
be
captured
to
the
relief
of
england
seward
held
out
big
promises
based
on
the
capture
of
new
orleans
and
these
for
a
time
calmed
governmental
apprehensions
though
by
midsummer
it
was
clear
that
the
inability
to
secure
the
country
back
of
the
city
together
with
the
southern
determination
to
burn
their
cotton
rather
than
see
it
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
would
prevent
any
great
supply
from
the
mississippi
valley
this
was
still
not
a
matter
of
concern
for
the
government
and
the
manufacturers
both
held
the
opinion
that
it
was
not
lack
of
cotton
alone
that
was
responsible
for
the
distress
and
the
manufacturers
were
just
beginning
to
unload
their
stocks
but
in
considering
and
judging
the
attitude
of
the
british
public
on
this
question
of
cotton
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
the
great
mass
of
the
people
sincerely
believed
that
america
was
responsible
for
the
distress
in
lancashire
the
error
in
understanding
was
more
important
than
the
truth
in
judging
governmental
policy
however
the
truth
as
regards
the
causes
of
distress
in
england
is
the
more
important
element
the
cotton
lords
did
not
choose
to
reveal
it
one
must
believe
that
they
intentionally
dwelt
upon
the
war
as
the
sole
responsible
cause
in
the
first
important
parliamentary
debate
on
cotton
may
not
a
word
was
said
of
any
other
element
in
the
situation
and
it
is
to
be
noted
not
a
word
advocating
a
change
in
british
neutral
policy
it
is
to
be
noted
also
that
this
debate
occurred
when
for
two
months
past
the
numbers
on
poor
relief
in
lancashire
were
temporarily
decreasing
and
the
general
tone
of
the
speakers
was
that
while
the
distress
was
serious
it
was
not
beyond
the
power
of
the
local
communities
to
meet
it
there
was
not
then
in
may
any
reason
for
grave
concern
and
russell
expressed
governmental
conviction
when
he
wrote
to
gladstone
may
we
must
i
believe
get
thro
the
cotton
crisis
as
we
can
and
promote
inland
works
and
railroads
in
india
moreover
the
southern
orders
to
destroy
cotton
rather
than
permit
its
capture
and
export
by
the
north
disagreeably
affected
british
officials
up
to
the
end
of
august
russell
while
writing
much
to
lyons
on
england
necessity
for
cotton
did
not
do
so
in
a
vein
indicative
of
criticism
of
northern
policy
nor
in
the
sense
that
british
distress
demanded
special
official
consideration
such
demands
on
america
as
were
made
up
to
this
time
came
wholly
from
france
it
was
not
then
cotton
primarily
which
brought
a
revival
in
july
of
the
southern
attack
on
the
government
through
parliament
june
had
seen
the
collapse
of
lindsay
initial
move
and
palmerston
answer
to
hopwood
june
that
there
was
no
intention
at
present
to
offer
mediation
appeared
final
it
was
not
cotton
but
mcclellan
defeat
that
produced
a
quick
renewal
of
lindsay
activities
june
hopwood
had
withdrawn
his
motion
favouring
recognition
but
in
doing
so
asked
whether
considering
the
great
and
increasing
distress
in
the
country
the
patient
manner
in
which
it
has
hitherto
been
borne
and
the
hopelessness
of
the
termination
of
hostilities
the
government
intend
to
take
any
steps
whatever
either
as
parties
to
intervention
or
otherwise
to
endeavour
to
put
an
end
to
the
civil
war
in
america
this
was
differently
worded
yet
contained
little
variation
from
his
former
question
of
june
and
this
time
palmerston
replied
briefly
that
the
government
certainly
would
like
to
mediate
if
it
saw
any
hope
of
success
but
that
at
present
both
parties
would
probably
reject
it
if
a
different
situation
should
arise
the
government
would
be
glad
to
act
this
admission
was
now
seized
upon
by
lindsay
who
on
july
introduced
a
motion
demanding
consideration
of
the
propriety
of
offering
mediation
with
the
view
of
terminating
hostilities
and
insisted
upon
a
debate
thus
while
the
first
week
of
june
seemed
to
have
quieted
rumours
of
british
mediation
the
end
of
the
month
saw
them
revived
adams
was
keenly
aware
of
the
changing
temper
of
opinion
and
on
june
presented
to
russell
a
strong
representation
by
seward
who
wrote
under
the
president
instructions
that
such
recurrent
rumours
were
highly
injurious
to
the
north
since
upon
hopes
of
foreign
aid
the
south
has
been
encouraged
and
sustained
from
the
first
day
of
secession
having
developed
this
complaint
at
some
length
seward
went
on
to
a
brief
threat
containing
the
real
meat
of
the
despatch
that
if
foreign
nations
did
venture
to
intervene
or
mediate
in
favour
of
the
south
the
north
would
be
forced
to
have
recourse
to
a
weapon
hitherto
not
used
namely
to
aid
in
a
rising
of
the
slaves
against
their
masters
this
was
clearly
a
threat
of
a
servile
war
if
great
britain
aided
the
south
a
war
which
would
place
britain
in
a
very
uncomfortable
position
in
view
of
her
sentiments
in
the
past
it
is
evidence
of
discretion
that
this
despatch
written
may
was
held
back
from
presentation
to
russell
until
revived
rumours
of
mediation
made
the
american
minister
anxious
no
answer
was
given
by
russell
for
over
a
month
a
fact
in
itself
indicative
of
some
hesitancy
on
policy
soon
the
indirect
diplomacy
of
napoleon
iii
was
renewed
in
the
hope
of
british
concurrence
july
slidell
informed
mason
that
persigny
in
conversation
had
assured
him
that
this
government
is
now
more
anxious
than
ever
to
take
prompt
and
decided
action
in
our
favour
slidell
asked
if
it
was
impossible
to
stir
parliament
but
acknowledged
that
everything
depended
on
palmerston
that
august
body
seems
to
be
as
afraid
of
him
as
the
urchins
of
a
village
school
of
the
birch
of
their
pedagogue
unquestionably
persigny
here
gave
slidell
a
hint
of
private
instructions
now
being
sent
by
napoleon
to
thouvenel
who
was
on
a
visit
to
london
the
emperor
telegraphed
demandez
au
gouvernement
anglais
ne
croit
pas
le
moment
venu
de
reconnaître
le
sud
palmerston
had
already
answered
this
question
in
parliament
and
thouvenel
was
personally
very
much
opposed
to
the
emperor
suggestion
there
were
press
rumours
that
he
was
in
london
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
head
but
his
report
to
mercier
was
that
interference
in
america
was
a
very
dangerous
matter
and
that
he
would
have
been
badly
received
by
palmerston
and
russell
if
he
had
suggested
any
change
in
neutral
policy
in
spite
of
this
decided
opposition
by
the
french
minister
of
foreign
affairs
it
is
evident
that
one
ground
for
renewed
southern
hopes
was
the
knowledge
of
the
emperor
private
desires
lindsay
chose
his
time
well
for
on
july
the
first
thorough
report
on
lancashire
was
laid
before
parliament
revealing
an
extremity
of
distress
not
previously
officially
authenticated
and
during
this
week
the
papers
were
full
of
an
impending
disaster
to
mcclellan
army
lyons
now
in
london
on
his
vacation
trip
was
concerned
for
the
future
mainly
because
of
cotton
but
did
not
believe
there
was
much
danger
of
an
immediate
clash
with
america
but
the
great
southern
argument
of
the
moment
was
the
northern
military
failure
the
ability
of
the
south
to
resist
indefinitely
and
the
hopelessness
of
the
war
on
the
morning
of
july
all
london
was
in
excitement
over
press
statements
that
the
latest
news
from
america
was
not
of
mcclellan
retreat
but
of
the
capture
of
his
entire
army
lindsay
motion
was
set
for
debate
on
this
same
july
adams
thought
the
story
of
mcclellan
surrender
had
been
set
afloat
to
carry
the
house
of
commons
off
their
feet
in
its
debate
the
debate
itself
may
be
regarded
as
a
serious
attempt
to
push
the
ministry
into
a
position
more
favourable
to
the
south
and
the
arguments
advanced
surveyed
the
entire
ground
of
the
causes
of
secession
and
the
inevitability
of
the
final
separation
of
north
and
south
they
need
but
brief
summary
lindsay
refusing
to
accede
to
appeals
for
postponement
because
the
south
was
winning
anyway
argued
that
slavery
was
no
element
in
the
conflict
that
the
southern
cause
was
just
and
that
england
because
of
her
own
difficulties
should
mediate
and
bring
to
a
conclusion
a
hopeless
war
he
claimed
the
time
was
opportune
since
mediation
would
be
welcomed
by
a
great
majority
in
the
north
and
he
quoted
from
a
letter
by
a
labouring
man
in
lancashire
stating
we
think
it
high
time
to
give
the
southern
states
the
recognition
they
so
richly
deserve
other
speakers
emphasized
lancashire
distress
gregory
said
we
should
remember
what
is
impending
over
lancashire
what
want
what
woe
what
humiliation
and
that
not
caused
by
the
decree
of
god
but
by
the
perversity
of
man
i
leave
the
statistics
of
the
pauperism
that
is
and
that
is
to
be
to
my
honourable
friends
the
representatives
of
manufacturing
england
no
statistics
were
forthcoming
from
this
quarter
for
not
a
representative
from
lancashire
participated
in
the
debate
save
hopwood
who
at
the
very
end
upbraided
his
fellow
members
from
the
district
for
their
silence
and
was
interrupted
by
cries
of
divide
divide
lindsay
quoted
letter
was
met
by
opponents
of
mediation
with
the
assertion
that
the
operatives
were
well
known
to
be
united
against
any
action
and
that
they
could
be
sustained
in
luxury
from
the
public
purse
for
far
less
a
cost
than
that
of
a
war
with
america
but
cotton
did
not
play
the
part
expected
of
it
in
this
debate
forster
in
a
very
able
speech
cleverly
keeping
close
to
a
consideration
of
the
effect
of
mediation
on
advanced
the
idea
that
such
a
step
would
not
end
the
war
but
would
merely
intensify
it
and
so
prolong
english
commercial
distress
he
did
state
however
that
intervention
as
distinct
from
mediation
would
bring
on
a
servile
war
in
america
thus
giving
evidence
of
his
close
touch
with
adams
and
his
knowledge
of
seward
despatch
of
may
in
the
main
the
friends
of
the
north
were
content
to
be
silent
and
leave
it
to
the
government
to
answer
lindsay
this
was
good
tactics
and
they
were
no
doubt
encouraged
to
silence
by
evidence
early
given
in
the
debate
that
there
would
be
no
positive
result
from
the
motion
gregory
showed
that
this
was
a
real
on
the
government
by
his
bitter
criticisms
of
russell
three
months
speech
at
the
conclusion
of
gregory
speech
lindsay
and
his
friends
their
immediate
purpose
accomplished
and
fearing
a
vote
wished
to
adjourn
the
debate
indefinitely
palmerston
objected
he
agreed
that
everyone
earnestly
wished
the
war
in
america
to
end
but
he
declared
that
such
debates
were
a
great
mistake
unless
something
definite
was
to
follow
since
they
only
served
to
create
irritation
in
america
both
north
and
south
he
concluded
with
a
vigorous
assertion
that
if
the
ministry
were
to
administer
the
affairs
of
the
nation
it
ought
to
be
trusted
in
foreign
affairs
and
not
have
its
hands
tied
by
parliamentary
expressions
of
opinion
at
inopportune
moments
finally
the
south
had
not
yet
securely
established
its
independence
and
hence
could
not
be
recognized
this
motion
if
carried
would
place
england
on
a
definite
side
and
thus
be
fatal
to
any
hope
of
successful
mediation
or
intervention
in
the
future
having
now
made
clear
the
policy
of
the
government
palmerston
did
not
insist
upon
a
division
and
the
motion
was
withdrawn
on
the
surface
lindsay
effort
of
july
had
resulted
in
ignominious
failure
lyons
called
it
i
do
not
think
we
know
here
sufficiently
the
extent
of
the
disaster
to
mcclellan
to
be
able
to
come
to
any
conclusion
as
to
what
the
european
powers
should
do
but
the
impression
left
by
the
debate
that
there
was
a
strong
parliamentary
opinion
in
favour
of
mediation
made
lyons
add
i
suppose
mercier
will
open
full
cry
on
the
scent
and
be
all
for
mediation
i
am
still
afraid
of
any
attempt
of
the
kind
very
much
the
same
opinion
was
held
by
henry
adams
who
wrote
the
pinch
has
again
passed
by
for
the
moment
and
we
breathe
more
freely
but
i
think
i
wrote
to
you
some
time
ago
that
if
july
found
us
still
in
virginia
we
could
no
longer
escape
interference
i
think
now
that
it
is
inevitable
a
definite
stand
taken
by
the
north
on
slavery
would
bring
the
greatest
strength
in
this
running
battle
in
spite
of
surface
appearances
that
the
debate
was
the
pinch
was
not
in
fact
passed
as
the
activities
of
slidell
and
mason
and
their
friends
soon
indicated
for
a
fortnight
the
cabinet
reacting
to
the
repeated
suggestions
of
napoleon
the
northern
defeats
and
the
distress
in
lancashire
was
seriously
considering
the
possibility
of
taking
some
step
toward
mediation
on
july
two
days
before
the
debate
in
the
commons
slidell
at
last
had
his
first
personal
contact
with
napoleon
and
came
away
from
the
interview
with
the
conviction
that
if
england
long
persists
in
her
inaction
he
napoleon
would
be
disposed
to
act
without
her
this
was
communicated
to
mason
on
july
but
slidell
did
as
yet
see
fit
to
reveal
to
mason
that
in
the
interview
with
napoleon
he
had
made
a
definite
push
for
separate
action
by
france
offering
inducements
on
cotton
a
special
commercial
treaty
and
alliances
defensive
and
offensive
for
mexican
affairs
this
last
without
any
authority
from
benjamin
the
confederate
secretary
of
state
on
july
slidell
made
a
similar
offer
to
thouvenel
and
left
with
him
a
full
memorandum
of
the
southern
proposal
he
was
cautioned
that
it
was
undesirable
his
special
offer
to
france
should
reach
the
ears
of
the
british
government
a
caution
which
he
transmitted
to
mason
on
july
when
sending
copies
of
benjamin
instructions
but
still
without
revealing
the
full
extent
of
his
own
overtures
to
napoleon
illustration
john
slidell
nicolay
and
hay
life
of
abraham
lincoln
the
century
new
in
all
this
slidell
was
still
exhibiting
that
hankering
to
pull
off
a
special
diplomatic
achievement
characteristic
of
the
man
and
in
line
also
with
a
persistent
theory
that
the
policy
most
likely
to
secure
results
was
that
of
inducing
france
to
act
alone
but
he
was
repeatedly
running
against
advice
that
france
must
follow
great
britain
and
the
burden
of
his
july
letter
to
mason
was
an
urging
that
a
demand
for
recognition
be
now
made
simultaneously
in
paris
and
london
thouvenel
not
at
all
enthusiastic
over
slidell
proposals
told
him
that
this
was
at
least
a
prerequisite
and
on
july
slidell
wrote
mason
the
demand
should
be
made
at
once
mason
on
the
advice
of
lindsay
fitzgerald
and
lord
malmesbury
had
already
prepared
a
request
for
recognition
but
had
deferred
making
it
after
listening
to
the
debate
of
july
now
on
july
he
addressed
russell
referring
to
their
interview
of
february
in
which
he
had
urged
the
claims
of
the
confederacy
to
recognition
and
again
presented
them
asserting
that
the
subsequent
failure
of
northern
campaigns
had
demonstrated
the
power
of
the
south
to
maintain
its
independence
the
south
he
wrote
asked
neither
aid
nor
intervention
it
merely
desired
recognition
and
continuation
of
british
neutrality
on
the
same
day
mason
also
asked
for
an
interview
but
received
no
reply
until
july
when
russell
wrote
that
no
definite
answer
could
be
sent
until
after
a
cabinet
and
that
an
interview
did
not
seem
necessary
this
answer
clearly
indicates
that
the
government
was
in
uncertainty
it
is
significant
that
russell
took
this
moment
to
reply
at
last
to
seward
protestations
of
may
which
had
been
presented
to
him
by
adams
on
june
he
instructed
stuart
at
washington
that
his
delay
had
been
due
to
a
waiting
for
military
events
but
that
these
had
been
indecisive
he
gave
a
résumé
of
all
the
sins
of
the
north
as
a
belligerent
and
wrote
in
a
distinctly
captious
spirit
yet
these
sins
had
not
induced
her
majesty
government
to
swerve
an
inch
from
an
impartial
neutrality
here
was
no
promise
of
a
continuance
of
neutrality
rather
a
hint
of
some
coming
change
at
least
one
member
of
the
cabinet
was
very
ready
for
it
gladstone
wrote
privately
it
is
indeed
much
to
be
desired
that
this
bloody
and
purposeless
conflict
should
cease
from
the
first
it
has
been
plain
enough
that
the
whole
question
was
whether
the
south
was
earnest
and
united
that
has
now
for
some
months
been
demonstrated
and
the
fact
thus
established
at
once
places
the
question
beyond
the
region
even
of
the
most
brilliant
military
successes
gladstone
was
primarily
influenced
by
the
british
commercial
situation
lyons
still
in
england
and
a
consistent
opponent
of
a
change
of
policy
feared
this
commercial
influence
he
wrote
to
stuart
i
can
hardly
anticipate
any
circumstances
under
which
i
should
think
the
intervention
of
england
in
the
quarrel
between
the
north
and
south
advisable
but
it
is
very
unfortunate
that
no
result
whatever
is
apparent
from
the
nominal
of
new
orleans
and
other
ports
and
the
distress
in
the
manufacturing
districts
threatens
to
be
so
great
that
a
pressure
may
be
put
upon
the
government
which
they
will
find
it
difficult
to
resist
in
parliament
sneers
were
indulged
in
by
palmerston
at
the
expense
of
the
silent
cotton
manufacturers
of
lancashire
much
to
the
fury
of
cobden
of
this
period
arnold
later
sarcastically
remarked
that
the
representatives
of
lancashire
in
the
houses
of
parliament
did
not
permit
the
gaieties
of
the
exhibition
season
wholly
to
divert
their
attention
from
the
distress
which
prevailed
in
the
home
county
being
refused
an
interview
mason
transmitted
to
russell
on
august
a
long
appeal
rather
than
a
demand
for
recognition
using
exactly
those
arguments
advanced
by
lindsay
in
debate
the
answer
evidently
given
after
that
cabinet
for
whose
decision
russell
had
been
waiting
was
dated
august
in
it
russell
as
in
his
reply
to
seward
on
july
called
attention
to
the
wholly
contradictory
statements
of
north
and
south
on
the
status
of
the
war
which
in
british
opinion
had
not
yet
reached
a
stage
positively
indicative
of
the
permanence
of
southern
independence
great
britain
therefore
still
waited
but
the
time
might
come
when
southern
firmness
in
resistance
would
bring
recognition
the
tone
was
more
friendly
than
any
expressions
hitherto
used
by
russell
to
southern
representatives
the
reply
does
not
reveal
the
decision
actually
arrived
at
by
the
ministry
gladstone
wrote
to
argyll
on
august
that
yesterday
a
cabinet
had
been
held
on
the
question
to
move
or
not
to
move
in
the
matter
of
the
american
civil
war
he
had
come
away
before
a
decision
when
it
became
evident
the
prevailing
sentiment
would
be
nothing
shall
be
done
until
both
parties
are
desirous
of
it
gladstone
thought
this
very
foolish
he
would
have
england
approach
france
and
russia
but
if
they
were
not
ready
wait
until
they
were
something
i
trust
will
be
done
before
the
hot
weather
is
over
to
stop
these
frightful
horrors
all
parties
had
been
waiting
since
the
debate
of
july
for
the
cabinet
decision
it
was
at
once
generally
known
as
no
step
at
present
and
wisdom
would
have
decreed
quiet
acquiescence
apparently
one
southern
friend
on
his
own
initiative
felt
the
need
to
splutter
on
the
next
day
august
lord
campbell
in
the
lords
moved
for
the
production
of
russell
correspondence
with
mason
making
a
very
confused
speech
society
and
parliament
were
convinced
the
war
ought
to
end
in
separation
at
one
time
campbell
argued
that
reconquest
of
the
south
was
impossible
at
another
that
england
should
interfere
to
prevent
such
reconquest
again
he
urged
that
the
north
was
in
a
situation
where
she
could
not
stop
the
war
without
aid
from
europe
in
extricating
her
probably
the
motion
was
made
merely
to
draw
from
russell
an
official
statement
production
of
the
papers
was
refused
russell
stated
that
the
government
still
maintained
its
policy
of
strict
neutrality
that
if
any
action
was
to
be
taken
it
should
be
by
all
the
maritime
powers
and
that
if
in
the
parliamentary
recess
any
new
policy
seemed
advisable
he
would
first
communicate
with
those
powers
he
also
declared
very
positively
that
as
yet
no
proposal
had
been
received
from
any
foreign
power
in
regard
to
america
laying
stress
upon
the
perfect
accord
between
great
britain
and
france
mason
commented
on
this
speech
that
someone
was
evidently
lying
and
naturally
believed
that
someone
to
be
russell
he
hoped
that
france
would
promptly
make
this
clear
but
france
gave
no
sign
of
lack
of
perfect
accord
on
the
contrary
thouvenel
even
discouraged
slidell
from
following
mason
example
of
demanding
recognition
and
the
formal
communication
was
withheld
mason
acquiescing
slidell
thought
new
disturbances
in
italy
responsible
for
this
sudden
lessening
of
french
interest
in
the
south
but
he
was
gloomy
seeing
again
the
frustration
of
high
hopes
august
he
wrote
benjamin
you
will
find
by
my
official
correspondence
that
we
are
still
hard
and
fast
aground
here
nothing
will
float
us
off
but
a
strong
and
continued
current
of
important
successes
in
the
field
i
have
no
hope
from
england
because
i
am
satisfied
that
she
desires
an
indefinite
prolongation
of
the
war
until
the
north
shall
be
entirely
exhausted
and
broken
down
nothing
can
exceed
the
selfishness
of
english
statesmen
except
their
wretched
hypocrisy
they
are
continually
casting
about
their
disinterested
magnaminity
and
objection
of
all
other
considerations
than
those
dictated
by
a
morality
while
their
entire
policy
is
marked
by
egotism
and
duplicity
i
am
getting
to
be
heartily
tired
of
paris
on
august
parliament
adjourned
having
passed
on
the
last
day
of
the
session
an
act
for
the
relief
of
the
distress
in
lancashire
by
authorizing
an
extension
of
powers
to
the
poor
law
guardians
like
slidell
and
mason
circles
in
london
thought
that
in
august
there
had
come
to
a
disastrous
end
the
southern
push
for
a
change
in
british
policy
and
were
jubilant
to
be
sure
russell
had
merely
declared
that
the
time
for
action
was
not
yet
come
but
this
was
regarded
as
a
sop
thrown
to
the
south
neither
in
informed
southern
nor
northern
circles
outside
the
cabinet
was
there
any
suspicion
by
that
in
the
six
months
elapsed
since
lindsay
had
begun
his
movement
the
ministry
had
been
slowly
progressing
in
thoughts
of
mediation
in
fact
the
sentiment
of
the
cabinet
as
stated
by
gladstone
had
been
to
mediation
when
both
parties
were
ready
for
it
and
that
such
readiness
would
come
soon
most
members
were
convinced
this
was
a
convenient
and
reasonable
ground
for
postponing
action
but
did
not
imply
that
if
the
conviction
were
unrealized
no
mediation
would
be
attempted
mcclellan
driven
out
of
the
peninsula
had
been
removed
and
august
saw
the
northern
army
pressed
back
from
virginia
soil
it
was
now
washington
and
not
richmond
that
seemed
in
danger
of
capture
surely
the
north
must
soon
realize
the
futility
of
further
effort
and
the
reports
early
in
july
from
washington
dilated
upon
the
rapid
emergence
of
a
strong
peace
party
but
the
first
panic
of
dismay
once
past
stuart
sent
word
of
enormous
new
northern
levies
of
men
and
of
renewed
courage
by
writing
of
cotton
he
thought
the
prospect
of
obtaining
any
quantity
of
it
seems
hopeless
and
at
the
same
time
reported
the
peace
party
fast
losing
ground
in
the
face
of
the
great
energy
of
the
administration
as
to
recognition
stuart
believed
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
in
the
presence
of
these
enormous
fresh
levies
but
to
wait
and
see
what
the
next
two
months
will
bring
forth
the
hopes
of
the
british
ministry
based
on
a
supposed
northern
weariness
of
the
war
were
being
shattered
argyll
having
received
from
sumner
a
letter
describing
the
enthusiasm
and
determination
of
the
north
wrote
to
gladstone
it
is
evident
whatever
may
be
our
opinion
of
the
prospects
of
north
that
they
do
not
yet
at
least
feel
any
approach
to
such
exhaustion
as
will
lead
them
to
admit
of
mediation
to
this
gladstone
replied
i
agree
that
this
is
not
a
state
of
mind
favourable
to
mediation
and
i
admit
it
to
be
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
to
determine
when
the
first
step
ought
to
be
taken
but
i
can
not
subscribe
to
the
opinion
of
those
who
think
that
europe
is
to
stand
silent
without
limit
of
time
and
witness
these
horrors
and
absurdities
which
will
soon
have
consumed
more
men
and
done
ten
times
more
mischief
than
the
crimean
war
but
with
the
difference
that
there
the
end
was
uncertain
here
it
is
certain
in
the
opinion
of
the
whole
world
except
one
of
the
parties
i
should
be
puzzled
to
point
out
a
single
case
of
dismemberment
which
has
been
settled
by
the
voluntary
concession
of
the
stronger
party
without
any
interference
or
warning
from
third
powers
and
as
far
as
principle
goes
there
never
was
a
case
in
which
warning
was
so
proper
and
becoming
because
of
the
frightful
misery
which
this
civil
conflict
has
brought
upon
other
countries
and
because
of
the
unanimity
with
which
it
is
condemned
by
the
civilized
world
the
renewal
of
northern
energy
first
reports
of
which
were
known
to
russell
early
in
august
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
british
ministry
their
progress
toward
mediation
had
been
slow
but
steady
initial
steps
resented
as
an
effort
in
indirect
diplomacy
and
not
supported
by
france
officially
had
received
prompt
rejection
accompanied
by
no
indication
of
a
desire
to
depart
from
strict
neutrality
with
the
cessation
in
late
june
of
the
northern
victorious
progress
in
arms
and
in
the
face
of
increasing
distress
in
lancashire
the
second
answer
to
lindsay
was
less
dogmatic
as
given
by
palmerston
the
government
desired
to
offer
mediation
but
saw
no
present
hope
of
doing
so
successfully
finally
the
government
asked
for
a
free
hand
making
no
pledges
mason
might
be
gloomy
adams
exultant
but
when
august
dawned
plans
were
already
on
foot
for
a
decided
change
the
secret
was
well
kept
four
days
after
the
cabinet
decision
to
wait
on
events
two
days
after
russell
refusal
to
produce
the
correspondence
with
mason
russell
on
the
eve
of
departure
for
the
continent
was
writing
to
palmerston
mercier
notion
that
we
should
make
some
move
in
october
agrees
very
well
with
yours
i
shall
be
back
in
england
before
october
and
we
could
then
have
a
cabinet
upon
it
of
course
the
war
may
flag
before
that
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
a
proposal
for
an
armistice
should
be
the
first
step
but
we
must
be
prepared
to
answer
the
question
on
what
basis
are
we
to
negotiate
the
next
movement
to
put
an
end
to
the
war

to
come

nor

the

the

of

recently
also
there
has
been
advanced
an
argument
that
wheat
defeated
cotton
an
idea
put
forward
indeed
in
england
itself
during
the
war
by
friends
who
pointed
to
the
great
flow
of
wheat
from
the

as
essential
in
a
situation
in

britain
schmidt
in
the
influence
of
wheat
and
cotton
on
relations
during
the
civil
war
a
paper
read
before
the
american
historical
association
and
since
published
in
the
journal
of
history
and
july
presents
with
much
care
all
the
important
statistics
for
both
commodities
but
his
conclusions
seem
to
me
wholly
erroneous
he
states
that
great
britain
dependence
on
northern
wheat
operated
as
a
contributing
influence
in
keeping
the
british
government
officially
neutral
a
cautious
statement
soon
transformed
to
the
positive
one
that
this
fact
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
the
english
government
since
leading
journals
referred
to
it
progressively
it
is
asserted
but
it
was
northern
wheat
that
may
well
be
regarded
as
the
decisive
factor
counterbalancing
the
influence
of
cotton
in
keeping
the
british
government
from
recognizing
the
confederacy
that
the
wheat
situation
must
have
exerted
a
profound
influence
on
the
government
and
finally
in
this
contest
wheat
won
demonstrating
its
importance
as
a
world
power
of
greater
significance
than
cotton

interesting
thesis

i
think
schmidt
errors
are
a
mistake
as
to
the
time
when

of

was
in
governmental
consideration
he
places
it
in
midsummer
when
in
fact
the
danger
had
passed
by
january
of
that
year
a
mistake
in
placing
cotton
and
wheat
supply
on
a
parity
since
the
former
could
not
be
obtained
in
quantity
from
source
before
while
wheat
though
coming
from
the
united
states
could
have
been
obtained
from
interior
russia
as
well
as
from
the
maritime
provinces
in
increased
supply
if
britain
had
been
willing
to
pay
the
added
price
of
inland
transport
there
was
a
real
famine
of
cotton
there
would
have
been
none
of
wheat
merely
a
higher
cost
this
fact
a
vital
one
in
determining
influence
was
brought
out
by
george
mchenry
in
the
columns
of
the
fact
in
spite
of
all

that
while

was

only
be
averted
by
the
favour
of
divine
providence
or
our
own
efforts
the
anxiety
attending
my
responsibility
is
only
postponed
at
this
very
moment
adams
was
much
disturbed
by
his
failure
to
secure
governmental
seizure
of
a
war
vessel
being
built
at
liverpool
for
the
south
the
famous
which
was
soon
completed
and
put
to
sea
but
ten
days
later
july
russell
delay
in
enforcing
british
neutrality
as
adams
saw
it
in
this
matter
reinforcing
the
fears
of
a
change
in
policy
had
led
him
to
explain
his
alarm
to
seward
on
august
adams
received
an
instruction
written
august
outlining
the
exact
steps
to
be
taken
in
case
the
feared
change
in
british
policy
should
occur
as
printed
in
the
diplomatic
documents
later
presented
to
congress
this
despatch
is
merely
a
very
interesting
if
somewhat
discursive
essay
on
the
inevitability
of
european
ruminations
on
the
possibility
of
interference
to
end
the
war
and
argues
the
unwisdom
of
such
interference
especially
for
great
britain
own
interests
it
does
not
read
as
if
seward
were
alarmed
or
indeed
as
if
he
had
given
serious
consideration
to
the
supposed
danger
but
this
conveys
a
very
erroneous
impression
an
unprinted
portion
of
the
despatch
very
specifically
and
in
a
very
serious
tone
instructs
adams
that
if
approached
by
the
british
government
with
propositions
implying
a
purpose
to
dictate
or
to
mediate
or
to
advise
or
even
to
solicit
or
persuade
you
will
answer
that
you
are
forbidden
to
debate
to
hear
or
in
any
way
receive
entertain
or
transmit
any
communication
of
the
kind
if
you
are
asked
an
opinion
what
reception
the
president
would
give
to
such
a
proposition
if
made
here
you
will
reply
that
you
are
not
instructed
but
you
have
no
reason
for
supposing
that
it
would
be
entertained
this
was
to
apply
either
to
great
britain
alone
or
acting
in
conjunction
with
other
powers
further
if
the
south
should
be
acknowledged
adams
was
immediately
to
suspend
his
functions
you
will
perceive
wrote
seward
that
we
have
approached
the
contemplation
of
that
crisis
with
the
caution
which
great
reluctance
has
inspired
but
i
trust
that
you
will
also
have
perceived
that
the
crisis
has
not
appalled
us
this
serious
and
definite
determination
by
the
north
to
resent
any
intervention
by
europe
makes
evident
that
seward
and
lincoln
were
fully
committed
to
forcible
resistance
of
foreign
meddling
briefly
if
the
need
arose
the
north
would
go
to
war
with
europe
adams
at
least
now
knew
where
he
stood
and
could
but
await
the
result
the
instruction
he
held
in
reserve
nor
was
it
ever
officially
communicated
to
russell
he
did
however
state
its
tenor
to
forster
who
had
contacts
with
the
cabinet
through
and
though
no
proof
has
been
found
that
the
american
determination
was
communicated
to
the
ministry
the
presumption
is
that
this
occurred
such
communication
could
not
have
taken
place
before
the
end
of
august
and
possibly
was
not
then
made
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
cabinet
was
scattered
in
the
long
vacation
and
that
apparently
the
plan
to
move
in
the
american
war
was
as
yet
unknown
save
to
palmerston
and
to
russell
russell
letter
to
palmerston
of
august
sets
the
date
of
their
determination
meanwhile
they
were
depending
much
upon
advices
from
washington
for
the
exact
moment
stuart
was
suggesting
with
mercier
that
october
should
be
selected
and
continued
his
urgings
even
though
his
immediate
chief
lyons
was
writing
to
him
from
london
strong
personal
objections
to
any
european
intervention
whatever
and
especially
any
by
great
britain
lyons
explained
his
objections
to
russell
as
well
but
stuart
having
gone
to
the
extent
of
consulting
also
with
stoeckl
the
russian
minister
at
washington
was
now
in
favour
of
recognition
of
the
confederacy
as
the
better
measure
this
thought
stoeckl
was
less
likely
to
bring
on
war
with
the
north
than
an
attempt
at
mediation
soon
stuart
was
able
to
give
notice
a
full
month
in
advance
of
the
event
of
lincoln
plan
to
issue
an
emancipation
proclamation
postponed
temporarily
on
the
insistence
of
seward
but
he
attached
no
importance
to
this
regarding
it
as
at
best
a
measure
of
pretence
intended
to
frighten
the
south
and
to
influence
foreign
governments
russell
was
not
impressed
with
stuart
shift
from
mediation
to
recognition
i
think
he
wrote
we
must
allow
the
president
to
spend
his
second
batch
of
men
before
we
can
hope
that
he
and
his
democracy
will
listen
to
reason
but
this
did
not
imply
that
russell
was
wavering
in
the
idea
that
october
would
be
a
ripe
time
soon
he
was
journeying
to
the
continent
in
attendance
on
the
queen
and
using
his
leisure
to
perfect
his
great
plan
russell
first
positive
step
was
taken
on
september
on
that
date
he
wrote
to
cowley
in
paris
instructing
him
to
sound
thouvenel
and
the
day
following
he
wrote
to
palmerston
commenting
on
the
news
just
received
of
the
exploits
of
stonewall
jackson
in
virginia
it
really
looks
as
if
he
might
end
the
war
in
october
the
hour
will
be
ripe
for
the
cabinet
similar
reactions
were
expressed
by
palmerston
at
the
same
moment
and
for
the
same
reasons
palmerston
also
wrote
on
september
the
federals
got
a
very
complete
smashing
even
washington
or
baltimore
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
confederates
if
this
should
happen
would
it
not
be
time
for
us
to
consider
whether
in
such
a
state
of
things
england
and
france
might
not
address
the
contending
parties
and
recommend
an
arrangement
upon
the
basis
of
separation
russell
replied
i
agree
with
you
that
the
time
is
come
for
offering
mediation
to
the
united
states
government
with
a
view
to
the
recognition
of
the
independence
of
the
confederates
i
agree
further
that
in
case
of
failure
we
ought
ourselves
to
recognize
the
southern
states
as
an
independent
state
for
the
purpose
of
taking
so
important
a
step
i
think
we
must
have
a
meeting
of
the
cabinet
the
or
would
suit
me
for
the
meeting
the
two
elder
statesmen
being
in
such
complete
accord
the
result
of
the
unofficial
overture
to
france
was
now
awaited
with
interest
this
considering
the
similar
unofficial
suggestions
previously
made
by
napoleon
was
surprisingly
lukewarm
cowley
reported
that
he
had
held
a
long
and
serious
conversation
with
thouvenel
on
the
subject
of
mediation
as
instructed
by
russell
on
the
thirteenth
and
found
a
disposition
to
wait
to
see
the
result
of
the
elections
in
the
north
mercier
apparently
had
been
writing
that
southern
successes
would
strengthen
the
northern
peace
party
thouvenel
idea
was
that
if
the
peace
party
gains
the
ascendant
lincoln
and
seward
both
of
whom
were
too
far
committed
to
listen
to
foreign
suggestions
would
probably
be
set
aside
he
also
emphasized
the
serious
consequences
england
and
france
might
expect
if
they
recognized
the
south
i
said
that
we
might
propose
an
armistice
without
mediation
and
that
if
the
other
powers
joined
with
us
in
doing
so
and
let
it
be
seen
that
a
refusal
would
be
followed
by
the
recognition
of
the
southern
states
the
certainty
of
such
recognition
by
all
europe
must
carry
weight
with
it
thouvenel
saw
some
difficulties
especially
russia
the
french
government
had
some
time
back
sounded
that
of
russia
as
to
her
joining
france
and
england
in
an
offer
of
mediation
and
had
been
met
by
an
almost
scornful
refusal
it
appears
also
that
there
is
less
public
pressure
here
for
the
recognition
of
the
south
than
there
is
in
england
thouvenel
lack
of
enthusiasm
might
have
operated
as
a
check
to
russell
had
he
not
been
aware
of
two
circumstances
causing
less
weight
than
formerly
to
be
attached
to
the
opinions
of
the
french
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
the
first
was
the
difference
on
american
policy
between
thouvenel
and
napoleon
iii
and
the
conviction
that
the
emperor
was
at
any
moment
ready
to
impose
his
will
if
only
england
would
give
the
signal
the
second
circumstance
was
still
more
important
it
was
already
known
through
the
french
press
that
a
sharp
conflict
had
arisen
in
the
government
as
to
italian
policy
and
all
signs
pointed
to
a
reorganization
of
the
ministry
which
would
exclude
thouvenel
under
these
circumstances
russell
could
well
afford
to
discount
thouvenel
opinion
the
extent
to
which
he
was
ready
to
go
much
beyond
either
the
offer
of
mediation
or
of
armistice
evidently
in
cowley
mind
is
shown
by
a
letter
to
gladstone
september
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
october
may
be
soon
enough
for
a
cabinet
if
i
am
free
to
communicate
the
views
which
palmerston
and
i
entertain
to
france
and
russia
in
the
interval
between
this
time
and
the
middle
of
next
month
these
views
had
the
offer
of
mediation
to
both
parties
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
case
of
refusal
by
the
north
to
recognition
of
the
south
mediation
on
the
basis
of
separation
and
recognition
accompanied
by
a
declaration
of
neutrality
the
perfected
plan
thus
outlined
had
resulted
from
a
communication
to
palmerston
of
cowley
report
together
with
a
memorandum
proposed
to
be
sent
to
cowley
but
again
addressed
to
france
alone
russell
here
also
stated
that
he
had
explained
his
ideas
to
the
queen
she
only
wishes
austria
prussia
and
russia
to
be
consulted
i
said
that
should
be
done
but
we
must
consult
france
first
also
enclosed
was
a
letter
from
stuart
of
september
reporting
mercier
as
just
returned
from
new
york
and
convinced
that
if
advantage
were
not
taken
of
the
present
time
to
do
exactly
that
which
was
in
russell
mind
europe
would
have
to
wait
for
the
complete
exhaustion
of
the
north
russell
was
now
at
home
again
and
the
next
day
palmerston
approved
the
plans
as
excellent
but
he
asked
whether
it
would
not
be
well
to
include
russia
in
the
invitation
as
a
compliment
even
though
she
might
probably
decline
as
to
the
other
european
powers
the
matter
could
wait
for
an
after
communication
yet
that
palmerston
still
wished
to
go
slowly
is
shown
by
a
comment
on
the
military
situation
in
america
it
is
evident
that
a
great
conflict
is
taking
place
to
the
of
washington
and
its
issue
must
have
a
great
effect
on
the
state
of
affairs
if
the
federals
sustain
a
great
defeat
they
may
be
at
once
ready
for
mediation
and
the
iron
should
be
struck
while
it
is
hot
if
on
the
other
hand
they
should
have
the
best
of
it
we
may
wait
awhile
and
see
what
may
follow
thus
through
palmerston
caution
russia
had
been
added
to
france
in
russell
proposed
memorandum
and
the
communication
to
cowley
had
not
been
sent
off
immediately
as
the
letter
to
gladstone
of
september
indicates
but
the
plan
was
regarded
as
so
far
determined
upon
that
on
september
russell
requested
lyons
not
to
fix
as
yet
upon
a
date
for
his
departure
for
america
writing
mercier
is
again
looking
out
for
an
opportunity
to
offer
mediation
and
this
time
he
is
not
so
much
out
in
his
reckoning
curiously
mercier
had
again
changed
his
mind
and
now
thought
a
proposal
of
an
armistice
was
the
best
move
being
particularly
anxious
that
there
should
be
no
mention
of
the
word
but
of
this
russell
had
as
yet
no
inkling
with
full
approval
of
the
plan
as
now
outlined
palmerston
wrote
to
gladstone
september
that
he
and
russell
were
in
complete
agreement
that
an
offer
of
mediation
should
be
made
by
the
three
maritime
powers
but
that
no
actual
step
would
be
taken
without
the
sanction
of
the
cabinet
two
days
later
russell
explained
to
gladstone
the
exact
nature
of
the
proposal
but
that
there
was
even
now
no
thoroughly
worked
out
agreement
on
the
sequence
of
steps
necessary
is
shown
by
palmerston
letter
to
gladstone
of
the
in
which
is
outlined
a
preliminary
proposal
of
an
armistice
cessation
of
blockade
and
negotiation
on
the
basis
of
separation
other
members
of
the
cabinet
were
likewise
informed
of
the
proposed
overture
to
france
and
russia
and
soon
it
was
clear
that
there
would
be
opposition
granville
had
replaced
russell
in
attendance
upon
the
queen
at
gotha
he
now
addressed
a
long
and
careful
argument
to
russell
opposing
the
adventure
as
he
thought
it
summing
up
his
opinion
in
this
wise
i
doubt
if
the
war
continues
long
after
our
recognition
of
the
south
whether
it
will
be
possible
for
us
to
avoid
drifting
into
it
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
premature
to
depart
from
the
policy
which
has
hitherto
been
adopted
by
you
and
lord
palmerston
and
which
notwithstanding
the
strong
antipathy
to
the
north
the
strong
sympathy
with
the
south
and
the
passionate
wish
to
have
cotton
has
met
with
such
general
approval
from
parliament
the
press
and
the
public
but
granville
had
little
hope
his
views
would
prevail
a
few
days
later
he
wrote
to
lord
stanley
of
alderley
i
have
written
to
johnny
my
reasons
for
thinking
it
decidedly
premature
i
however
suspect
you
will
settle
to
do
so
pam
johnny
and
gladstone
would
be
in
favour
of
it
and
probably
newcastle
i
do
not
know
about
the
others
it
appears
to
me
a
great
mistake
opportunely
giving
added
effect
to
granville
letter
there
now
arrived
confused
accounts
from
america
of
the
battles
about
washington
and
of
a
check
to
the
southern
advance
on
september
there
had
been
fought
the
battle
of
antietam
and
two
days
later
lee
giving
up
his
maryland
campaign
began
a
retreat
through
the
shenandoah
valley
toward
the
old
defensive
southern
lines
before
richmond
there
was
no
pursuit
for
mcclellan
again
briefly
in
command
thought
his
army
too
shattered
for
an
advance
palmerston
had
been
counting
on
a
great
southern
victory
and
was
now
doubtful
whether
the
time
had
come
after
all
for
european
overtures
to
the
contestants
october
he
wrote
russell
my
dear
russell
i
return
you
granville
letter
which
contains
much
deserving
of
serious
consideration
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
offer
of
mediation
upon
the
basis
of
separation
would
be
accepted
by
the
south
why
should
it
not
be
accepted
it
would
give
the
south
in
principle
the
points
for
which
they
are
fighting
the
refusal
if
refusal
there
was
would
come
from
the
north
who
would
be
unwilling
to
give
up
the
principle
for
which
they
have
been
fighting
so
long
as
they
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
by
going
on
fighting
they
could
carry
their
point
the
condition
of
things
therefore
which
would
be
favourable
to
an
offer
of
mediation
would
be
great
success
of
the
south
against
the
north
that
state
of
things
seemed
ten
days
ago
to
be
approaching
its
advance
has
been
lately
checked
but
we
do
not
yet
know
the
real
course
of
recent
events
and
still
less
can
we
foresee
what
is
about
to
follow
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
more
may
throw
a
clearer
light
upon
future
prospects
as
regards
possible
resentment
on
the
part
of
the
northerns
following
upon
an
acknowledgment
of
the
independence
of
the
south
it
is
quite
true
that
we
should
have
less
to
care
about
that
resentment
in
the
spring
when
communication
with
canada
was
open
and
when
our
naval
force
could
more
easily
operate
upon
the
american
coast
than
in
winter
when
we
are
cut
off
from
canada
and
the
american
coast
is
not
so
safe
but
if
the
acknowledgment
were
made
at
one
and
the
same
time
by
england
france
and
some
other
powers
the
yankees
would
probably
not
seek
a
quarrel
with
us
alone
and
would
not
like
one
against
a
european
confederation
such
a
quarrel
would
render
certain
and
permanent
that
southern
independence
the
acknowledgment
of
which
would
have
caused
it
the
first
communication
to
be
made
by
england
and
france
to
the
contending
parties
might
be
not
an
absolute
offer
of
mediation
but
a
friendly
suggestion
whether
the
time
was
not
come
when
it
might
be
well
for
the
two
parties
to
consider
whether
the
war
however
long
continued
could
lead
to
any
other
result
than
separation
and
whether
it
might
not
therefore
be
best
to
avoid
the
great
evils
which
must
necessarily
flow
from
a
prolongation
of
hostilities
by
at
once
coming
to
an
agreement
to
treat
upon
that
principle
of
separation
which
must
apparently
be
the
inevitable
result
of
the
contest
however
long
it
may
last
the
best
thing
would
be
that
the
two
parties
should
settle
details
by
direct
negotiation
with
each
other
though
perhaps
with
the
rancorous
hatred
now
existing
between
them
this
might
be
difficult
but
their
quarrels
in
negotiation
would
do
us
no
harm
if
they
did
not
lead
to
a
renewal
of
war
an
armistice
if
not
accompanied
by
a
cessation
of
blockades
would
be
all
in
favour
of
the
north
especially
if
new
orleans
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
north
the
whole
matter
is
full
of
difficulty
and
can
only
be
cleared
up
by
some
more
decided
events
between
the
contending
armies
palmerston
very
evidently
palmerston
was
experiencing
doubts
and
was
all
in
favour
of
cautious
delay
american
military
events
more
than
arguments
influenced
him
but
almost
immediately
there
appeared
a
much
more
vigorous
and
determined
opponent
within
the
cabinet
cornewall
lewis
was
prompt
to
express
objections
october
russell
transmitted
to
palmerston
a
letter
of
disapproval
from
lewis
russell
also
momentarily
was
hesitating
he
wrote
this
american
question
must
be
well
sifted
i
send
you
a
letter
of
lewis
who
is
against
moving
my
only
doubt
is
whether
we
and
france
should
stir
if
russia
holds
back
her
separation
from
our
move
would
ensure
the
rejection
of
our
proposals
but
we
shall
know
more
by
the
i
have
desired
a
cabinet
to
be
summoned
for
that
day
but
the
summons
will
not
go
out
till
saturday
so
if
you
wish
to
stop
it
write
to
hammond
from
this
it
would
appear
that
russia
had
been
approached
but
that
russell
chief
concern
was
the
attitude
of
france
that
his
proposed
private
communication
to
cowley
had
been
despatched
and
that
he
was
waiting
an
answer
which
might
be
expected
before
the
sixteenth
if
so
his
expectations
were
negatived
by
that
crisis
now
on
in
the
french
ministry
over
the
italian
question
prohibiting
consideration
of
any
other
matter
on
october
thouvenel
was
dismissed
but
his
formal
retirement
from
office
did
not
take
place
until
october
several
ministers
abroad
among
them
flahault
at
london
followed
him
into
retirement
and
foreign
affairs
were
temporarily
in
confusion
the
emperor
was
away
from
paris
and
all
that
cowley
reported
was
that
the
last
time
he
had
seen
thouvenel
the
latter
had
merely
remarked
that
as
soon
as
the
emperor
came
back
the
two
governments
ought
to
enter
into
a
serious
consideration
of
the
whole
question
cowley
himself
was
more
concerned
that
it
was
now
becoming
clear
france
in
spite
of
previous
protestations
was
planning
colonizing
mexico
up
to
the
end
of
september
therefore
the
british
government
while
wholly
confident
that
france
would
agree
in
any
effort
whatsoever
that
england
might
wish
to
make
had
no
recent
assurances
either
official
or
private
to
this
effect
this
did
not
disturb
russell
who
took
for
granted
french
approval
and
soon
he
cast
aside
the
hesitation
caused
by
the
doubts
of
granville
the
opposition
of
lewis
and
the
caution
of
palmerston
public
opinion
was
certainly
turning
toward
a
demand
for
ministerial
action
two
days
of
further
consideration
caused
him
to
return
to
the
attack
october
he
wrote
palmerston
i
think
unless
some
miracle
takes
place
this
will
be
the
very
time
for
offering
mediation
or
as
you
suggest
proposing
to
north
and
south
to
come
to
terms
two
things
however
must
be
made
clear
i
that
we
propose
separation
ii
that
we
shall
take
no
part
in
the
war
unless
attacked
ourselves
how
russell
proposed
to
evade
a
war
with
an
angry
north
was
not
made
clear
but
in
this
same
letter
notice
was
given
that
he
was
preparing
a
memorandum
for
the
cabinet
russell
was
still
for
a
mediation
on
lines
of
separation
but
his
uncertainty
even
confusion
of
mind
became
evident
but
another
two
days
later
on
receipt
of
a
letter
from
stuart
written
september
in
which
he
and
mercier
were
now
all
for
a
suggestion
of
armistice
with
no
mention
of
separation
russell
now
thought
if
no
fresh
battles
occur
i
think
the
suggestion
might
be
adopted
tho
i
am
far
from
thinking
with
mercier
that
the
north
would
accept
it
but
it
would
be
a
fair
and
defensible
course
leaving
it
open
to
us
to
hasten
or
defer
recognition
if
the
proposal
is
declined
lord
lyons
might
carry
it
over
on
the
british
policy
as
represented
by
the
inclinations
of
the
foreign
secretary
having
started
out
on
a
course
portending
positive
and
vigorous
action
was
now
evidently
in
danger
of
veering
far
to
one
side
if
not
turning
completely
about
but
the
day
after
russell
seemed
to
be
considering
such
an
attenuation
of
the
earlier
plan
as
to
be
content
with
a
mere
suggestion
of
armistice
a
bomb
was
thrown
into
the
already
troubled
waters
further
and
violently
disturbing
them
this
was
gladstone
speech
at
newcastle
october
a
good
third
of
which
was
devoted
to
the
civil
war
and
in
which
he
asserted
that
jefferson
davis
had
made
an
army
was
making
a
navy
and
had
created
something
still
greater
a
nation
the
chronology
of
shifts
in
opinion
would
at
first
glance
indicate
that
gladstone
made
this
speech
with
the
intention
of
forcing
palmerston
and
russell
to
continue
in
the
line
earlier
adopted
thus
hoping
to
bolster
up
a
cause
now
losing
ground
his
declaration
coming
from
a
leading
member
of
of
the
cabinet
was
certain
to
be
accepted
by
the
public
as
a
foreshadowing
of
governmental
action
if
jefferson
davis
had
in
truth
created
a
nation
then
early
recognition
must
be
given
it
but
this
surmise
of
intentional
pressure
is
not
borne
out
by
any
discovered
evidence
on
the
contrary
the
truth
is
seemingly
that
gladstone
in
the
north
and
out
of
touch
was
in
complete
ignorance
that
the
two
weeks
elapsed
since
his
letters
from
palmerston
and
russell
had
produced
any
alteration
of
plan
or
even
any
hesitation
himself
long
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
british
intervention
in
some
form
gladstone
evidently
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
make
the
good
news
known
his
declaration
foreshadowing
a
policy
that
did
not
pertain
to
his
own
department
and
more
especially
that
had
not
yet
received
cabinet
approval
was
in
itself
an
offence
against
the
traditions
of
british
cabinet
organization
he
had
spoken
without
authorization
and
off
his
own
bat
the
speculative
market
sensitive
barometer
of
governmental
policy
immediately
underwent
such
violent
fluctuations
as
to
indicate
a
general
belief
that
gladstone
speech
meant
action
in
the
war
the
price
of
raw
cotton
dropped
so
abruptly
as
to
alarm
southern
friends
and
cause
them
to
give
assurances
that
even
if
the
blockade
were
broken
there
would
be
no
immediate
outpouring
of
cotton
from
southern
ports
on
the
other
hand
bright
staunch
friend
of
the
north
that
gladstone
was
merely
seeking
to
overcome
a
reluctance
of
palmerston
and
russell
to
move
he
was
sore
at
heart
over
the
vile
speech
of
your
old
acquaintance
and
friend
the
leading
newspapers
while
at
first
accepting
the
newcastle
speech
as
an
authoritative
statement
and
generally
though
mildly
approving
were
quick
to
feel
that
there
was
still
uncertainty
of
policy
and
became
silent
until
it
should
be
made
clear
just
what
was
in
the
wind
within
the
cabinet
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
gladstone
had
caused
no
small
stir
both
by
reason
of
his
unusual
procedure
and
by
his
sentiments
on
russell
however
much
disliked
was
the
incursion
into
his
own
province
the
effect
was
reinvigoration
of
a
desire
to
carry
through
at
least
some
portion
of
the
plan
and
he
determined
to
go
on
with
the
proposal
of
an
armistice
six
days
after
gladstone
speech
russell
circulated
october
a
memorandum
on
america
this
memorandum
asserted
that
the
south
had
shown
conclusively
its
power
to
resist
had
maintained
a
successful
defensive
that
the
notion
of
a
strong
element
in
the
south
had
been
shown
to
be
wholly
delusive
that
the
emancipation
proclamation
promising
a
freeing
of
the
slaves
in
the
sections
still
in
rebellion
on
january
was
no
humanitarian
or
idealistic
measure
since
it
left
slavery
in
the
loyal
or
recognized
districts
and
was
but
an
incitement
to
servile
war
a
most
terrible
plan
for
these
reasons
russell
urged
that
the
great
powers
ought
seriously
to
consider
whether
it
was
not
their
duty
to
propose
a
suspension
of
arms
for
the
purpose
of
weighing
calmly
the
advantages
of
peace
this
was
a
far
cry
from
mediation
and
recognition
nor
did
russell
indicate
either
the
proposed
terms
of
an
armistice
or
the
exact
steps
to
be
taken
by
europe
in
bringing
it
about
and
making
it
of
value
but
the
memorandum
of
october
does
clearly
negative
what
has
been
the
accepted
british
political
tradition
which
is
to
the
effect
that
palmerston
angered
at
gladstone
presumption
and
now
determined
against
action
had
put
up
cornewall
lewis
to
reply
in
a
public
speech
thereby
permitting
public
information
that
no
cabinet
decision
had
as
yet
been
reached
lewis
speech
was
made
at
hereford
on
october
such
were
the
relations
between
palmerston
and
russell
that
it
is
impossible
the
former
would
have
so
used
lewis
without
notifying
russell
in
which
case
there
would
have
been
no
foreign
office
memorandum
of
the
thirteenth
lewis
was
in
fact
vigorously
maintaining
his
objections
already
made
known
to
russell
to
plan
of
departure
from
the
hitherto
accepted
policy
of
neutrality
and
his
speech
at
hereford
was
the
opening
gun
of
active
opposition
lewis
did
not
in
any
sense
pose
as
a
friend
of
the
north
rather
he
treated
the
whole
matter
in
his
speech
at
hereford
and
later
in
the
cabinet
as
one
requiring
cool
judgment
and
decision
on
the
sole
ground
of
british
interests
this
was
the
line
best
suited
to
sustain
his
arguments
but
does
not
prove
as
some
have
thought
that
his
cabinet
acknowledgment
of
the
impossibility
of
northern
complete
victory
was
his
private
conviction
at
hereford
lewis
argued
that
everyone
must
acknowledge
a
great
war
was
in
progress
and
must
admit
it
to
be
undecided
under
such
circumstances
the
time
had
not
yet
arrived
when
it
could
be
asserted
in
accordance
with
the
established
doctrines
of
international
law
that
the
independence
of
the
southern
states
had
been
established
in
effect
lewis
gave
public
notice
that
no
cabinet
decision
had
yet
been
reached
a
step
equally
opposed
to
cabinet
traditions
with
gladstone
speech
since
equally
unauthorized
but
excusable
in
the
view
that
the
first
offence
against
tradition
had
forced
a
rejoinder
for
the
public
lewis
accomplished
his
purpose
and
the
press
refrained
from
comment
awaiting
results
meanwhile
palmerston
who
must
finally
determine
policy
was
remaining
in
uncertainty
and
in
this
situation
thought
it
wise
to
consult
indirectly
derby
the
leader
of
the
opposition
in
parliament
this
was
done
through
clarendon
who
wrote
to
palmerston
on
october
that
derby
was
averse
to
action
he
said
that
he
had
been
constantly
urged
to
in
recognition
and
mediation
but
had
always
refused
on
the
ground
that
recognition
would
merely
irritate
the
north
without
advancing
the
cause
of
the
south
or
procuring
a
single
bale
of
cotton
and
that
mediation
in
the
present
temper
of
the
belligerents
be
rejected
even
if
the
mediating
powers
themselves
knew
what
to
propose
as
a
fair
basis
of
compromise
for
as
each
party
insisted
upon
having
that
which
the
other
declared
was
vitally
essential
to
its
existence
it
was
clear
that
the
war
had
not
yet
marked
out
the
stipulations
of
a
treaty
of
peace
the
recognition
of
the
south
could
be
of
no
benefit
to
england
unless
we
meant
to
sweep
away
the
blockade
which
would
be
an
act
of
hostility
towards
the
north
more
than
any
other
member
of
the
cabinet
lewis
was
able
to
guess
fairly
accurately
what
was
in
the
premier
mind
for
lewis
was
clarendon
and
the
most
intimate
and
esteemed
of
his
male
friends
they
were
in
constant
communication
as
the
cabinet
crisis
developed
and
lewis
next
step
was
taken
immediately
after
palmerston
consultation
of
derby
through
clarendon
october
lewis
circulated
a
memorandum
in
reply
to
that
of
russell
of
october
he
agreed
with
russell
statement
of
the
facts
of
the
situation
in
america
but
added
with
sarcasm
a
dispassionate
bystander
might
be
expected
to
concur
in
the
historical
view
of
lord
russell
and
to
desire
that
the
war
should
be
speedily
terminated
by
a
pacific
agreement
between
the
contending
parties
but
unhappily
the
decision
upon
any
proposal
of
the
english
government
will
be
made
not
by
dispassionate
bystanders
but
by
heated
and
violent
partisans
and
we
have
to
consider
not
how
the
proposal
indicated
in
the
memorandum
ought
to
be
received
or
how
it
would
be
received
by
a
conclave
of
philosophers
but
how
it
is
likely
to
be
received
by
the
persons
to
whom
it
would
be
addressed
lincoln
emancipation
proclamation
lewis
admitted
presumably
was
intended
to
incite
servile
war
but
that
very
fact
was
an
argument
against
not
for
british
action
since
it
revealed
an
intensity
of
bitterness
prohibitory
of
any
calm
consideration
of
issues
by
the
belligerents
and
suppose
the
north
did
acquiesce
in
an
armistice
the
only
peaceful
solution
would
be
an
independent
south
for
the
establishment
of
which
great
britain
would
have
become
intermediary
and
sponsor
any
policy
except
that
of
the
continuance
of
strict
neutrality
was
full
of
dangers
some
evident
some
but
dimly
visible
as
yet
statesmanship
required
great
caution
looking
to
the
probable
consequences
lewis
concluded
of
this
philanthropic
proposition
we
may
doubt
whether
the
chances
of
evil
do
not
preponderate
over
the
chances
of
good
and
whether
it
is
not
to
endure
the
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
which
we
know
not
of
at
the
exact
time
when
lewis
thus
voiced
his
objections
basing
them
on
the
lack
of
any
sentiment
toward
peace
in
america
there
were
received
at
the
foreign
office
and
read
with
interest
the
reports
of
a
british
special
agent
sent
out
from
washington
on
a
tour
of
the
western
states
anderson
reports
emphasized
three
points
emancipation
was
purely
a
war
measure
with
no
thought
of
ameliorating
the
condition
of
the
slaves
once
freed
even
if
the
war
should
stop
there
was
no
likelihood
of
securing
cotton
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
western
states
even
more
then
the
eastern
were
in
favour
of
vigorous
prosecution
of
the
war
and
the
new
call
for
men
was
being
met
with
enthusiasm
this
was
unpromising
either
for
relief
to
a
distressed
england
or
for
northern
acceptance
of
an
armistice
yet
russell
commenting
on
clarendon
letter
to
palmerston
containing
derby
advice
still
argued
that
even
if
declined
a
suggestion
of
armistice
could
do
no
harm
and
might
open
the
way
for
a
later
move
but
he
agreed
that
recognition
would
certainly
be
premature
at
present
russell
himself
now
heard
from
clarendon
and
learned
that
derby
had
been
constantly
urged
to
press
for
recognition
and
mediation
but
he
had
always
refused
on
the
ground
that
the
neutral
policy
hitherto
pursued
by
the
government
was
the
right
one
and
that
if
we
departed
from
it
we
should
only
meet
with
an
insolent
rejection
of
our
offer
a
long
conference
with
lyons
gave
cause
for
further
thought
and
russell
committed
himself
to
the
extent
that
he
acknowledged
we
ought
not
to
move
without
russia
finally
october
palmerston
reached
a
decision
for
the
immediate
present
writing
to
russell
your
description
of
the
state
of
things
between
the
two
parties
is
most
comprehensive
and
just
i
am
however
much
inclined
to
agree
with
lewis
that
at
present
we
could
take
no
step
nor
make
any
communication
of
a
distinct
proposition
with
any
advantage
all
that
we
could
possibly
do
without
injury
to
our
position
would
be
to
ask
the
two
parties
not
whether
they
would
agree
to
an
armistice
but
whether
they
might
not
turn
their
thoughts
towards
an
arrangement
between
themselves
but
the
answer
of
each
might
be
written
by
us
beforehand
the
northerners
would
say
that
the
only
condition
of
arrangement
would
be
the
restoration
of
the
union
the
south
would
say
their
only
condition
would
be
an
acknowledgment
by
the
north
of
southern
independence
we
should
not
be
more
advanced
and
should
only
have
pledged
each
party
more
strongly
to
the
object
for
which
they
are
fighting
i
am
therefore
inclined
to
change
the
opinion
on
which
i
wrote
to
you
when
the
confederates
seemed
to
be
carrying
all
before
them
and
i
am
very
much
come
back
to
our
original
view
of
the
matter
that
we
must
continue
merely
to
be
till
the
war
shall
have
taken
a
more
decided
turn
by
previous
arrangement
the
date
october
had
been
set
for
a
cabinet
to
consider
the
american
question
but
russell
now
postponed
it
though
a
few
members
appeared
and
held
an
informal
discussion
in
which
russell
still
justified
his
armistice
policy
and
was
opposed
by
lewis
and
the
majority
of
those
present
palmerston
did
not
attend
no
action
was
possible
and
technically
no
cabinet
was
held
it
soon
appeared
that
russell
vexed
at
the
turn
matters
had
taken
was
reluctant
in
yielding
and
did
not
regard
the
question
as
finally
settled
yet
on
the
afternoon
of
this
same
day
adams
much
disturbed
by
the
rumours
attendant
upon
the
speeches
of
gladstone
and
lewis
sought
an
explanation
from
russell
and
was
informed
that
the
government
was
not
inclined
at
present
to
change
its
policy
but
could
make
no
promises
for
the
future
this
appeared
to
adams
to
be
an
assurance
against
effort
by
great
britain
and
has
been
interpreted
as
disingenuous
on
russell
part
certainly
confidence
was
restored
by
the
interview
but
russell
was
apparently
unconvinced
as
yet
that
a
suggestion
of
armistice
would
necessarily
lead
to
the
evil
consequences
prophesied
by
lewis
or
would
indeed
require
any
departure
from
a
policy
of
strict
neutrality
on
the
one
side
russell
was
being
berated
by
as
weakly
continuing
an
outworn
policy
and
as
having
made
himself
the
of
europe
and
of
america
on
the
other
he
was
regarded
for
the
moment
as
insisting
through
pique
on
a
line
of
action
highly
dangerous
to
the
preservation
of
peace
with
the
north
october
palmerston
wrote
his
approval
of
the
cabinet
postponement
but
declared
lewis
doctrine
of
no
recognition
of
southern
independence
until
the
north
had
admitted
it
was
unsound
the
next
day
he
again
wrote
to
talk
to
the
belligerents
about
peace
at
present
would
be
as
useless
as
asking
the
winds
during
the
last
week
to
let
the
waters
remain
calm
this
expression
by
palmerston
on
the
day
after
the
question
apparently
had
come
to
a
conclusion
was
the
result
of
the
unexpected
persistence
of
russell
and
gladstone
replying
to
palmerston
letter
of
the
russell
wrote
as
no
good
could
come
of
a
cabinet
i
put
it
off
but
tho
i
am
quite
ready
to
agree
to
your
conclusions
for
the
present
i
can
not
do
so
for
lewis
reasons
lewis
besides
has
made
a
proposition
for
me
which
i
never
thought
of
making
he
says
i
propose
that
england
and
france
and
perhaps
some
one
continental
power
should
ask
america
to
suspend
the
war
i
never
thought
of
making
such
a
proposal
i
think
if
russia
agreed
prussia
would
and
if
france
and
england
agreed
austria
would
less
than
the
whole
five
would
not
do
i
thought
it
right
towards
the
cabinet
to
reserve
any
specific
proposition
i
am
not
at
all
inclined
to
adopt
lewis
invention
i
have
sent
off
lyons
without
instructions
at
which
he
is
much
pleased
russell
was
shifting
ground
first
the
proposal
was
to
have
been
made
by
england
and
france
then
russia
was
necessary
now
less
than
five
powers
would
not
do
but
whatever
the
number
required
he
still
desired
a
proposal
of
armistice
on
october
presumably
subsequent
to
the
informal
meeting
of
cabinet
members
he
drew
up
a
brief
memorandum
in
answer
to
that
of
lewis
on
october
denying
that
lewis
had
correctly
interpreted
his
plan
and
declaring
that
he
had
always
had
in
contemplation
a
step
by
the
five
great
powers
of
europe
the
advisability
of
trying
to
secure
such
joint
action
russell
asserted
was
all
he
had
had
in
mind
the
cabinet
had
approved
this
advisability
and
the
powers
were
acquiescent
in
answer
to
lewis
accusation
of
no
look
ahead
he
would
be
ready
with
definite
plans
for
the
negotiation
of
peace
between
north
and
south
thus
by
letter
to
palmerston
and
by
circulation
of
a
new
memorandum
russell
gave
notice
that
all
was
not
yet
decided
on
october
gladstone
also
circulated
a
memorandum
in
reply
to
lewis
urging
action
by
england
france
and
russia
russell
second
memorandum
was
not
at
first
taken
seriously
by
his
cabinet
opponents
they
believed
the
issue
closed
and
russell
merely
putting
out
a
denial
of
alleged
purposes
clarendon
though
not
a
member
of
the
cabinet
was
keeping
close
touch
with
the
situation
and
on
october
wrote
to
lewis
thanks
for
sending
me
your
memorandum
on
the
american
question
which
i
have
read
with
great
satisfaction
johnny
russell
always
loves
to
do
something
when
to
do
nothing
is
prudent
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
hoped
to
get
support
in
his
meddling
proclivities
when
he
called
a
cabinet
for
yesterday
but
its
postponement
is
probably
due
to
your
memorandum
you
have
made
so
clear
the
idiotic
position
we
should
occupy
either
in
having
presented
our
face
gratuitously
to
the
yankee
slap
we
should
receive
or
in
being
asked
what
practical
solution
we
had
to
propose
after
an
armistice
had
been
agreed
to
at
our
suggestion
that
no
discussion
on
the
subject
would
have
been
possible
and
the
foreign
secretary
probably
thought
it
would
be
pleasanter
to
draw
in
his
horns
at
woburn
than
in
downing
street
on
october
having
received
from
lewis
a
copy
of
paper
clarendon
wrote
again
the
foreign
secretary
exhibits
considerable
soreness
for
which
you
are
specially
bound
to
make
allowance
as
it
was
you
who
procured
abortion
for
him
he
had
thought
to
make
a
great
deal
of
his
colt
by
meddler
out
of
vanity
and
you
have
shown
his
backers
that
the
animal
was
not
fit
to
start
and
would
not
run
a
yard
if
he
did
he
is
therefore
taken
back
to
the
country
where
he
must
have
a
deal
more
training
before
he
can
appear
in
public
again
i
should
say
that
your
speech
at
hereford
was
nearly
as
effective
in
checking
the
alarm
and
speculation
caused
by
gladstone
speech
as
your
memorandum
was
in
smashing
the
foreign
secretary
proposed
intervention
and
that
you
did
so
without
in
the
smallest
degree
committing
either
the
government
or
yourself
with
respect
to
the
future
in
effect
clarendon
was
advising
lewis
to
pay
no
attention
to
complaining
rejoinder
since
the
object
desired
had
been
secured
but
there
was
still
one
element
of
strength
for
russell
and
gladstone
which
if
obtained
might
easily
cause
a
of
the
whole
question
this
was
the
desire
of
france
still
unexpressed
in
spite
of
indirect
overtures
a
silence
in
part
responsible
for
the
expression
of
an
opinion
by
palmerston
that
napoleon
words
could
not
be
depended
upon
as
an
indication
of
what
he
intended
to
do
on
the
day
this
was
written
the
french
ministerial
crisis
the
real
cause
of
silence
came
to
an
end
with
the
retirement
of
thouvenel
and
the
succession
of
drouyn
de
lhuys
russell
reply
to
palmerston
assertion
of
the
folly
of
appealing
now
to
the
belligerents
was
that
recognition
was
certainly
out
of
the
question
for
the
present
and
that
it
should
not
take
place
till
may
or
june
next
year
when
circumstances
may
show
pretty
clearly
whether
gladstone
was
right
but
this
yielding
to
the
premier
decision
was
quickly
withdrawn
when
at
last
napoleon
and
his
new
minister
could
turn
their
attention
to
the
american
question
on
october
cowley
reported
a
conversation
with
the
emperor
in
which
american
affairs
were
discussed
napoleon
hoped
that
england
france
and
russia
would
join
in
an
offer
of
mediation
cowley
replied
that
he
had
no
instructions
and
napoleon
then
modified
his
ideas
by
suggesting
a
proposal
of
armistice
for
six
months
in
order
to
give
time
for
the
present
excitement
to
calm
down
the
next
day
cowley
reported
that
drouyn
de
lhuys
stated
the
emperor
to
be
very
anxious
to
put
an
end
to
the
war
but
that
he
was
himself
doubtful
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
wait
a
little
longer
and
in
any
case
if
overtures
to
america
were
rejected
russia
probably
would
not
join
great
britain
and
france
in
going
on
to
a
recognition
of
the
south
all
this
was
exactly
in
line
with
that
plan
to
which
russell
had
finally
come
and
if
officially
notified
to
the
british
government
would
require
a
renewed
consideration
by
the
cabinet
presumably
napoleon
knew
what
had
been
going
on
in
london
and
he
now
hastened
to
give
the
needed
french
push
october
slidell
was
summoned
to
an
audience
and
told
of
the
emperor
purpose
acting
with
england
to
bring
about
an
armistice
three
days
later
october
cowley
wrote
that
he
had
now
been
officially
informed
by
drouyn
de
lhuys
by
the
orders
that
a
despatch
was
about
to
be
sent
to
the
french
ministers
in
england
and
russia
instructing
them
to
request
joint
action
by
the
three
powers
in
suggesting
an
armistice
of
six
months
a
suspension
of
the
thus
throwing
open
southern
ports
to
european
commerce
napoleon
proposal
evidently
took
palmerston
by
surprise
and
was
not
regarded
with
favour
he
wrote
to
russell
as
to
the
french
scheme
of
proposals
to
the
united
states
we
had
better
keep
that
question
till
the
cabinet
meets
which
would
be
either
on
monday
or
wednesday
as
would
be
most
convenient
to
you
and
our
colleagues
but
is
it
likely
that
the
federals
would
consent
to
an
armistice
to
be
accompanied
by
a
cessation
of
blockades
and
which
would
give
the
confederates
means
of
getting
all
the
supplies
they
may
want
then
comes
the
difficulty
about
slavery
and
the
giving
up
of
runaway
slaves
about
which
we
could
hardly
frame
a
proposal
which
the
southerns
would
agree
to
and
people
of
england
would
approve
of
the
french
government
are
more
free
from
the
shackles
of
principle
and
of
right
and
wrong
on
these
matters
as
on
all
others
than
we
are
at
all
events
it
would
be
wiser
to
wait
till
the
elections
in
north
america
are
over
before
any
proposal
is
made
as
the
emperor
is
so
anxious
to
put
a
stop
to
bloodshed
he
might
try
his
hand
as
a
beginning
by
putting
down
the
stream
of
ruffians
which
rolls
out
from
that
fountain
at
rome
but
russell
was
more
optimistic
or
at
least
in
favour
of
some
sort
of
proposal
to
america
he
replied
to
palmerston
my
notion
is
that
as
there
is
little
chance
of
our
good
offices
being
accepted
in
america
we
should
make
them
such
as
would
be
creditable
to
us
in
europe
i
should
propose
to
answer
the
french
proposal
therefore
by
saying
that
in
offering
our
good
offices
we
ought
to
require
both
parties
to
consent
to
examine
first
whether
there
are
any
terms
upon
which
north
and
south
would
consent
to
restore
the
union
and
secondly
failing
any
such
terms
whether
there
are
any
terms
upon
which
both
would
consent
to
separate
we
should
also
say
that
if
the
union
is
to
be
restored
it
would
be
essential
in
our
view
that
after
what
has
taken
place
all
the
slaves
should
be
emancipated
compensation
being
granted
by
congress
at
the
rate
at
which
great
britain
emancipated
her
slaves
in
if
separation
takes
place
we
must
be
silent
on
the
trend
of
slavery
as
we
are
with
regard
to
spain
and
brazil
this
is
a
rough
sketch
but
i
will
expand
it
for
the
cabinet
it
will
be
an
honourable
proposal
to
make
but
the
north
and
probably
the
south
will
refuse
it
here
were
several
ideas
quite
impossible
of
acceptance
by
north
and
south
in
their
then
frame
of
mind
and
russell
himself
believed
them
certain
to
be
refused
by
the
north
in
any
case
but
he
was
eager
to
present
the
question
for
cabinet
discussion
hoping
for
a
reversal
of
the
previous
decision
whether
from
pique
or
from
conviction
of
the
wisdom
of
a
change
in
british
policy
he
proposed
to
press
for
acceptance
of
the
french
plan
with
modifications
the
news
of
napoleon
offer
and
of
russell
attitude
with
some
uncertainty
as
to
that
of
palmerston
again
brought
lewis
into
action
and
on
november
he
circulated
another
memorandum
this
time
a
very
long
one
of
some
fifteen
thousand
words
this
was
in
the
main
an
historical
résumé
of
past
british
policy
in
relation
to
revolted
peoples
stating
the
international
law
of
such
cases
and
pointing
out
that
great
britain
had
never
recognized
a
revolted
people
so
long
as
a
struggle
was
still
going
on
peace
was
no
doubt
greatly
to
be
desired
if
england
could
by
legitimate
means
and
without
unduly
sacrificing
or
imperilling
her
own
interests
accelerate
this
consummation
she
would
in
my
opinion
earn
the
just
gratitude
of
the
civilized
world
but
the
question
as
he
had
previously
asserted
was
full
of
grave
dangers
the
very
suggestion
of
a
concert
of
powers
was
itself
one
to
be
avoided
a
conference
of
the
five
great
powers
is
an
imposing
force
but
it
is
a
dangerous
body
to
set
in
motion
a
single
intervening
power
may
possibly
contrive
to
satisfy
both
the
adverse
parties
but
five
intervening
powers
have
first
to
satisfy
one
another
who
could
tell
what
divergence
might
arise
on
the
question
of
slavery
or
on
boundaries
or
how
far
england
might
find
her
ideals
or
her
vital
interests
compromised
here
was
vigorous
resistance
to
russell
especially
effective
for
its
appeal
to
past
british
policy
and
to
correct
practice
in
international
law
on
the
same
day
that
lewis
memorandum
was
circulated
there
appeared
a
communication
in
the
by
historicus
on
the
international
doctrine
of
recognition
outlining
in
briefer
form
exactly
those
international
law
arguments
presented
by
lewis
and
advocating
a
continuation
of
the
policy
of
strict
neutrality
historicus
was
william
vernon
harcourt
husband
of
lewis
stepdaughter
who
was
also
the
niece
of
clarendon
evidently
the
family
guns
were
all
trained
on
russell
historicus
drove
home
the
fact
that
premature
action
by
a
neutral
was
a
hostile
act
and
ought
to
be
resented
by
the
sovereign
state
as
a
breach
of
neutrality
and
friendship
thus
on
receipt
of
the
news
of
napoleon
proposal
the
cabinet
crisis
was
renewed
and
even
more
sharply
than
on
october
the
french
offer
was
not
actually
presented
until
november
on
the
next
two
days
the
answer
to
be
made
received
long
discussion
in
the
cabinet
lewis
described
this
to
clarendon
prefacing
his
account
by
stating
that
russell
had
heard
by
telegram
from
napier
at
petersburg
to
the
effect
that
russia
would
not
join
but
would
support
proposals
through
her
minister
at
washington
provided
it
would
not
cause
irritation
having
made
this
statement
lord
john
proceeded
to
explain
his
views
on
the
question
these
were
briefly
that
the
recent
successes
of
the
democrats
afforded
a
most
favourable
opportunity
of
intervention
because
we
should
strengthen
their
hands
and
that
if
we
refused
the
invitation
of
france
russia
would
reconsider
her
decision
act
directly
with
france
and
thus
accomplish
her
favourite
purpose
of
separating
france
and
england
he
therefore
advised
that
the
proposal
of
france
should
be
accepted
palmerston
followed
lord
john
and
supported
him
but
did
not
say
a
great
deal
his
principal
argument
was
the
necessity
for
showing
sympathy
with
lancashire
and
of
not
throwing
away
any
chance
of
mitigating
it
the
proposal
was
now
thrown
before
the
cabinet
who
proceeded
to
pick
it
to
pieces
everybody
present
threw
a
stone
at
it
of
greater
or
less
size
except
gladstone
who
supported
it
and
the
chancellor
westbury
and
cardwell
who
expressed
no
opinion
the
principal
objection
was
that
the
proposed
armistice
of
six
months
by
sea
and
land
involving
a
suspension
of
the
commercial
blockade
was
so
grossly
unequal
so
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
south
that
there
was
no
chance
of
the
north
agreeing
to
it
after
a
time
palmerston
saw
that
the
general
feeling
of
the
cabinet
was
against
being
a
party
to
the
representation
and
he
capitulated
i
do
not
think
his
support
was
very
sincere
it
certainly
was
not
hearty
i
ought
to
add
that
after
the
cabinet
had
come
to
a
decision
and
the
outline
of
a
draft
had
been
discussed
the
chancellor
uttered
a
few
oracular
sentences
on
the
danger
of
refusing
the
french
invitation
and
gave
a
strong
support
to
lord
john
his
support
came
rather
late
i
proposed
that
we
should
le
at
washington
and
ascertain
whether
there
was
any
chance
of
the
proposal
being
accepted
lord
john
refused
this
he
admitted
there
was
no
chance
of
an
affirmative
answer
from
washington
i
think
his
principal
motive
was
a
fear
of
displeasing
france
and
that
palmerston
principal
motive
was
a
wish
to
seem
to
support
him
there
is
a
useful
article
in
throwing
cold
water
on
the
invitation
i
take
for
granted
that
delane
was
informed
of
the
result
of
the
cabinet
gladstone
writing
to
his
wife
gave
a
similar
though
more
brief
account
we
have
had
our
cabinet
and
meet
again
i
am
afraid
we
shall
do
little
or
nothing
in
the
business
of
america
but
i
will
send
you
definite
intelligence
both
lords
palmerston
and
russell
are
the
united
states
affair
has
ended
and
not
well
lord
russell
rather
turned
tail
he
gave
way
without
resolutely
fighting
out
his
battle
however
though
we
decline
for
the
moment
the
answer
is
put
upon
grounds
and
in
terms
which
leave
the
matter
very
open
for
the
future
i
think
the
french
will
make
our
answer
about
america
public
at
least
it
is
very
possible
but
i
hope
they
may
not
take
it
as
a
positive
refusal
or
at
any
rate
that
they
may
themselves
act
in
the
matter
it
will
be
clear
that
we
concur
with
them
that
the
war
should
cease
palmerston
gave
to
russell
proposal
a
feeble
and
support
the
reply
to
france
was
in
fact
immediately
made
public
both
in
france
and
in
england
it
was
complimentary
to
the
emperor
benevolent
views
and
humane
intentions
agreed
that
if
the
steps
proposed
were
to
be
taken
the
concurrence
of
russia
would
be
extremely
desirable
but
remarked
that
as
yet
great
britain
had
not
been
informed
that
russia
wished
to
and
concluded
that
since
there
was
no
ground
to
hope
the
north
was
ready
for
the
proposal
it
seemed
best
to
postpone
any
overture
until
there
was
a
greater
prospect
than
now
exists
of
its
being
accepted
by
the
two
contending
parties
the
argument
of
russell
in
the
cabinet
had
been
for
acceptance
without
russia
though
earlier
he
had
stipulated
her
assistance
as
essential
this
was
due
to
the
knowledge
already
at
hand
through
a
telegram
from
napier
at
petersburg
november
that
russia
would
refuse
but
in
the
answer
to
france
it
is
the
attitude
of
russia
that
becomes
an
important
reason
for
british
refusal
as
indeed
it
was
the
basis
for
harmonious
decision
within
the
british
cabinet
this
is
not
to
say
that
had
russia
acceded
england
also
would
have
done
so
for
the
weight
of
cabinet
opinion
adroitly
encouraged
by
palmerston
was
against
russell
and
the
result
reached
was
that
which
the
premier
wished
more
important
in
his
view
than
any
other
matter
was
the
preservation
of
a
united
ministry
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
american
debate
even
gladstone
could
write
as
to
the
state
of
matters
generally
in
the
cabinet
i
have
never
seen
it
smoother
public
opinion
in
england
in
the
main
heartily
supported
the
cabinet
decision
hammond
described
it
as
almost
universal
in
this
country
against
interference
an
estimate
justified
if
the
more
important
journals
are
taken
into
account
but
not
true
of
all
the
of
november
declared
we
are
convinced
that
the
present
is
not
the
moment
for
these
strong
measures
there
is
now
great
reason
to
hope
that
by
means
of
their
own
internal
action
the
americans
may
themselves
settle
their
own
affairs
even
sooner
than
europe
could
settle
them
for
them
we
have
waited
so
long
that
it
would
be
unpardonable
in
us
to
lose
the
merit
of
our
at
such
a
moment
as
this
we
quite
agree
with
cobden
that
it
would
be
cheaper
to
keep
all
lancashire
on
turtle
and
venison
than
to
plunge
into
a
desperate
war
with
the
northern
states
of
america
even
with
all
europe
at
our
back
in
a
good
cause
and
as
a
necessity
forced
upon
us
in
defence
of
our
honour
or
of
our
rightful
interests
we
are
as
ready
to
fight
as
we
ever
were
but
we
do
not
see
our
duty
or
our
interest
in
going
blindfold
into
an
adventure
such
as
this
we
very
much
doubt
more
over
whether
if
virginia
belonged
to
france
as
canada
belongs
to
england
the
emperor
of
the
french
would
be
so
active
in
beating
up
for
recruits
in
this
american
mediation
league
this
was
followed
up
two
days
later
by
an
assertion
that
no
english
statesman
had
at
any
time
contemplated
an
offer
of
mediation
made
in
such
a
way
as
to
lead
to
actual
conflict
with
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand
the
always
intense
in
its
utterances
and
strongly
in
politics
professed
itself
unable
to
credit
the
rumoured
cabinet
decision
until
we
are
positively
informed
that
our
ministers
are
guilty
of
the
great
crime
attributed
to
them
the
declared
we
must
hope
against
hope
that
they
are
innocent
if
guilty
they
were
responsible
for
the
misery
of
lancashire
depicted
in
lurid
colours
a
clear
a
sacred
an
duty
was
imposed
upon
them
to
perform
that
duty
would
have
been
the
pride
and
delight
of
almost
any
other
englishmen
and
they
with
the
task
before
them
and
the
power
to
perform
it
in
their
hands
can
it
be
that
they
have
shrunk
back
in
craven
cowardice
deserted
their
ally
betrayed
their
country
dishonoured
their
own
names
to
all
eternity
that
they
might
do
the
bidding
of
john
bright
and
sustain
for
a
while
the
infamous
tyranny
of
a
butler
a
seward
and
a
lincoln
in
the
and
navy
the
returned
editor
russell
but
lately
the
correspondent
in
america
jeered
at
the
american
uproar
that
might
now
be
expected
against
france
instead
of
england
let
the
emperor
beware
the
scarred
veteran
of
the
new
york
scarrons
of
plum
gut
has
set
his
sinister
or
dexter
eye
upon
him
and
threatens
him
with
the
loss
of
his
throne
but
the
british
public
must
expect
no
lasting
change
of
northern
attitude
toward
england
and
must
be
ready
for
a
war
if
the
north
were
victorious
for
november
strongly
censured
the
government
for
its
failure
to
act
the
for
january
as
strongly
supported
the
ministry
and
expanded
on
the
fixed
determination
of
great
britain
to
keep
out
of
the
war
naturally
frothed
in
angry
disappointment
continuing
its
attacks
as
if
in
hopes
of
a
reversal
of
ministerial
decision
even
into
the
next
year
has
it
come
to
this
is
england
or
the
english
cabinet
afraid
of
the
northern
states
lord
russell
might
contrive
so
to
choose
his
excuses
as
not
to
insult
at
once
both
his
country
and
her
ally
an
editorial
from
the
virginia
was
quoted
with
approval
characterizing
russell
and
palmerston
as
two
old
painted
mummies
who
secretly
were
rejoiced
at
the
war
in
america
as
threatening
the
complete
annihilation
of
both
sides
and
expressing
the
conviction
that
if
the
old
union
were
restored
both
north
and
south
would
eagerly
turn
on
great
britain
the
explanation
said
of
british
supineness
was
simply
the
pusillanimous
fear
of
war
and
of
a
war
that
would
not
take
place
in
spite
of
the
bluster
of
lincoln
even
as
late
as
may
of
the
year
following
this
explanation
was
still
harped
upon
and
russell
a
statesman
who
belonged
rather
to
the
past
than
to
the
present
was
primarily
responsible
for
british
inaction
the
nominal
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
is
in
the
hands
of
a
diplomatic
malaprop
who
has
never
shown
vigour
activity
or
determination
except
where
the
display
of
these
qualities
was
singularly
unneeded
or
even
worse
than
useless
never
wavered
from
its
assumption
that
in
the
cabinet
russell
was
the
chief
enemy
of
the
south
slidell
better
informed
wrote
who
would
have
believed
that
earl
russell
would
have
been
the
only
member
of
the
cabinet
besides
gladstone
in
favour
of
accepting
the
emperor
proposition
he
had
information
that
napoleon
had
been
led
to
expect
his
proposal
would
be
accepted
and
was
much
irritated
so
much
so
that
france
would
now
probably
act
alone
attitude
was
a
sorrow
to
many
of
his
friends
bright
believed
he
was
at
last
weaned
from
desires
for
mediation
and
sympathetic
with
the
answer
to
france
but
goldwin
smith
in
correspondence
with
gladstone
on
american
affairs
knew
that
the
wild
idea
now
in
the
statesman
mind
was
of
offering
canada
to
the
north
if
she
would
let
the
south
go
a
plan
unknown
fortunately
for
gladstone
reputation
for
good
judgment
save
to
his
correspondent
in
general
as
the
weeks
passed
the
satisfaction
grew
both
with
the
public
and
in
the
government
that
england
had
made
no
adventure
of
new
policy
towards
america
this
satisfaction
was
strongly
reinforced
when
the
first
reports
were
received
from
lyons
on
his
arrival
in
america
reaching
new
york
on
november
he
found
that
even
the
conservatives
were
much
opposed
to
an
offer
of
mediation
at
present
and
thought
it
would
only
do
harm
until
there
was
a
change
of
government
in
washington
an
event
still
remote
lyons
himself
believed
mediation
useless
unless
intended
to
be
followed
by
recognition
of
the
south
and
that
such
recognition
was
likewise
of
no
value
without
a
raising
of
the
blockade
for
which
he
thought
the
british
cabinet
not
prepared
lyons
flatly
contradicted
stuart
reports
his
cool
judgment
of
conditions
nowhere
more
clearly
manifested
than
at
this
juncture
in
comparison
with
his
subordinate
excited
and
eager
arguments
again
on
november
lyons
wrote
that
he
could
not
find
a
single
northern
paper
that
did
not
repudiate
foreign
intervention
in
the
south
when
it
was
learned
that
france
had
offered
to
act
and
england
had
refused
there
was
an
outburst
of
bitter
feeling
the
northern
press
as
lyons
had
reported
was
unanimous
in
rejection
of
european
offers
of
aid
however
friendly
in
settling
the
war
it
expressed
no
gratitude
to
england
devoting
its
energy
rather
to
animadversions
on
napoleon
iii
who
was
held
to
be
personally
responsible
since
there
had
been
no
european
offer
made
there
was
no
cause
for
governmental
action
seward
had
given
adams
specific
instructions
in
case
the
emergency
arose
but
there
had
been
no
reason
to
present
these
or
to
act
upon
them
and
the
crisis
once
past
seward
believed
all
danger
of
european
meddling
was
over
and
permanently
he
wrote
to
bigelow
we
are
no
longer
to
be
disturbed
by
secession
intrigues
in
europe
they
have
had
their
day
we
propose
to
forget
them
this
was
a
wise
and
statesmanlike
attitude
and
was
shared
by
adams
in
london
whatever
either
man
knew
or
guessed
of
the
prelude
to
the
answer
to
france
november
they
were
careful
to
accept
that
answer
as
fulfilment
of
russell
declaration
to
adams
october
that
great
britain
intended
no
change
of
policy
so
far
removed
was
seward
attitude
toward
england
from
that
ascribed
to
him
in
so
calm
was
his
treatment
of
questions
now
up
for
immediate
consideration
so
friendly
was
he
personally
toward
lyons
that
the
british
minister
became
greatly
alarmed
when
shortly
after
his
return
to
washington
there
developed
a
cabinet
controversy
threatening
the
retirement
of
the
secretary
of
state
this
was
a
quarrel
brought
on
by
the
personal
sensibilities
of
chase
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
directed
at
seward
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
it
was
quieted
by
the
tact
and
authority
of
lincoln
who
when
seward
handed
in
his
resignation
secured
from
chase
a
similar
offer
of
resignation
refused
both
and
in
the
result
read
to
chase
that
lesson
of
presidential
control
which
seward
had
learned
in
may
lyons
wrote
of
this
controversy
i
shall
be
sorry
if
it
ends
in
the
removal
of
seward
we
are
much
more
likely
to
have
a
man
less
disposed
to
keep
the
peace
than
a
man
more
disposed
to
do
so
i
should
hardly
have
said
this
two
years
ago
after
the
event
of
seward
retention
of
office
russell
wrote
i
see
seward
stays
in
i
am
very
glad
of
it
this
is
a
remarkable
reversal
of
former
opinion
a
better
understanding
of
seward
had
come
somewhat
slowly
to
british
diplomats
but
since
his
action
in
the
affair
former
suspicion
had
steadily
waned
his
high
tone
being
regarded
as
for
home
consumption
until
now
there
was
both
belief
in
seward
basic
friendliness
and
respect
for
his
abilities
thus
russell
ambitious
mediation
projects
having
finally
dwindled
to
a
polite
refusal
of
the
french
offer
to
join
in
a
mere
suggestion
of
armistice
left
no
open
sores
in
the
british
relations
with
america
the
projects
were
unknown
the
refusal
seemed
final
to
seward
and
was
indeed
destined
to
prove
so
but
of
this
there
was
no
clear
conception
in
the
british
cabinet
hardly
anyone
yet
believed
that
reconquest
of
the
south
was
even
a
remote
possibility
and
this
foretold
that
the
day
must
some
time
come
when
european
recognition
would
have
to
be
given
the
confederacy
it
is
this
unanimity
of
opinion
on
the
ultimate
result
of
the
war
in
america
that
should
always
be
kept
in
mind
in
judging
the
attitude
of
british
government
and
people
in
the
fall
of
their
sympathies
were
of
minor
concern
at
the
moment
nor
were
they
much
in
evidence
during
the
cabinet
crisis
all
argument
was
based
upon
the
expediency
and
wisdom
of
the
present
proposal
could
european
nations
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
to
an
early
end
a
war
whose
result
in
separation
was
inevitable
it
was
the
hope
that
such
action
promised
good
results
which
led
russell
to
enter
upon
his
policy
even
though
personally
his
sympathies
were
unquestionably
with
the
north
it
was
in
the
end
the
conviction
that
was
not
a
favourable
time
which
determined
palmerston
though
sympathetic
with
the
south
to
withdraw
his
support
when
russell
through
pique
insisted
on
going
on
moreover
both
statesmen
were
determined
not
to
become
involved
in
the
war
and
as
the
possible
consequences
of
even
the
most
friendly
offers
were
brought
out
in
discussion
it
became
clear
that
great
britain
true
policy
was
to
await
a
return
of
sanity
in
the
contestants
for
america
russell

dangerous

no

is
little

that
lewis
forebodings
would
have
been
realized
and

would
have
ensued
between
england
and
the
north
but
also
whatever
its
results
in
other
respects
the
independence
of
the
south
would
have
been
established
slavery
hated
of
great
britain
would
have
received
a
new
lease
of
life
and
by
british
action
in
the
cabinet
argument
all
parties
agreed
that
lincoln
emancipation
proclamation
was
but
an
incitement
to
servile
war
and
it
played
no
part
in
the
final
decision
soon
that
proclamation
was
to
erect
a
positive
barrier
of
public
opinion
against
any

never

the
british

was
full
of
suggestions
that

might

gracefully
come
from

since
that
country
was
presumed
to
be
on

but
with
no

of
an

meanwhile
mercier
had
again
approached
lyons
alleging
that
he
had
been
urged
by
greeley
editor
of
the
york
to
make
an
isolated
french
offer
but
that
he
felt
this
would
be
contrary
to
the
close
harmony
hitherto
maintained
in
relations
but
mercier
added
that
if
lyons
was
disinclined
to
a
proposal
of
mediation
he
intended
to
advise
his
government
to
give
him
authority
to
act
alone
lyons
made
no
comment
to

but
wrote
to
russell
i
certainly
desire
that
the

should
be
made
without
the

of

a
week
later
the
russian
minister
stoeckl
also
came
to
lyons
desiring
to
discover
what
would
be
england
attitude
if
russia
should
act
alone
or
perhaps
with
france
leaving
england
out
of
a
proposal
to
the
north
this
was
based
on
the
supposition
that
the
north
weary
of
war
might
ask
the
good
offices
of
russia
lyons
replied
that
he
did
not
think
that
contingency
near
and
otherwise
evaded
stoeckl
questions
but
he
was
somewhat
suspicious
concluding
his
report
i
can
not
quite
forget
that
monsieur
mercier
and
monsieur
de
stoeckl
had
agreed
to
go
to
richmond
together
last
spring
the
day
after
this

was
written
mercier
presented
february
the
isolated
french
offer
and
on
february
received
seward
reply
couched
in
argumentative
yet
polite
language
but
positively
declining
the
proposal
evidently
lyons
was
a
bit
disquieted
by
the
incident
but
in
london
napoleon
overture
to
america
was
officially
stated
to
be
unobjectionable
as
indeed
was
required
by
the
implications
of
the

russell
on

answered

communications
in
a
letter
marked
seen
by

the
queen

majesty

have
no
wish
to
interfere
at

in
any
way
in
the

if

her
majesty

would
feel
no
jealousy
or
repugnance
to
such
a
course
on
the
part
of

alone
the
writing
of
this
despatch
antedated
the
knowledge
that
france
had
already
acted
at
washington
and
does
not
necessarily
indicate
any
governmental
feeling
of
a
break
in
previous
close
relations
with
france
on
the
american
question
yet
this
was
indubitably
the
case
and
became
increasingly
evident
as
time
passed
russell
despatch
to
lyons
of
february
appears
rather
to
be
evidence
of
the
effect
of
the
debates
in
parliament
when
its
sessions
were
resumed
on
february
for
in
both
lords
and
commons
there
was
given
a
hearty
and
nearly
unanimous
support
of
the
government
decision
to
make
no
overture
for
a
cessation
of
the
conflict
in
america
derby
clearly
outlined
the
two
possible
conditions
of
mediation
first
when
efforts
by
the
north
to
subdue
the
south
had
practically
ceased
and
second
if
humane
interests
required
action
by
neutral
states
in
which
case
the
intervening
parties
must
be
fully
prepared
to
use
force
neither
condition
had
arrived
and
strict
neutrality
was
the
wise
course
disraeli
also
approved
strict
neutrality
but
caustically
referred
to
gladstone
newcastle
speech
and
sharply
attacked
the
cabinet
uncertain
and
changeable
policy
merely
a
party
speech
russell
upheld
the
government
decision
but
went
out
of
his
way
to
assert
that
the
entire
subjugation
of
the
south
would
be
a
calamity
to
the
united
states
itself
since
it
would
require
an
unending
use
of
force
to
hold
the
south
in
submission
later
when
news
of
the
french
offer
at
washington
had
been
received
the
government
was
attacked
in
the
lords
by
an
undaunted
friend
of
the
south
lord
campbell
on
the
ground
of
a
british
divergence
from
close
relations
with
france
russell
in
a
brief
reply
reasserted
old
arguments
that
the
time
had
not
yet
come
but
now
declared
that
events
seemed
to
show
the
possibility
of
a
complete
northern
victory
and
added
with
emphasis
that
recognition
of
the
south
could
justly
be
regarded
by
the
north
as
an
unfriendly
act
thus
parliament
and
cabinet
were
united
against
meddling
in
america
basing
this
attitude
on
neutral
duty
and
national
interests
and
with
barely
a
reference
to
the
new
policy
of
the
north
toward
slavery
declared
in
the
emancipation
proclamations
of
september
and
january
had
these
great
documents
then
no
favourable
influence
on
british
opinion
and
action
was
the
northern
determination
to
root
out
the
institution
of
slavery
now
clearly
announced
of
no
effect
in
winning
the
favour
of
a
people
and
government
long
committed
to
a
world
policy
against
that
institution
it
is
here
necessary
to
review
early
british
opinion
the
facts
preceding
the
first
emancipation
proclamation
and
to
examine
its
purpose
in
the
mind
of
lincoln
before
the
opening
of
actual
military
operations
while
there
was
still
hope
of
some
peaceful
solution
british
opinion
had
been
with
the
north
on
the
alleged
ground
of
sympathy
with
a
free
as
against
a
society
but
war
once
begun
the
disturbance
to
british
trade
interests
and
lincoln
repeated
declarations
that
the
north
had
no
intention
of
destroying
slavery
combined
to
offer
an
excuse
and
a
reason
for
an
almost
complete
shift
of
british
opinion
the
abolitionists
of
the
north
and
the
extreme
friends
in
england
relatively
few
in
number
in
both
countries
still
sounded
the
note
of
slavery
the
cause
of
the
war
but
got
little
hearing
nevertheless
it
was
seen
by
thoughtful
minds
that
slavery
was
certain
to
have
a
distinct
bearing
on
the
position
of
great
britain
when
the
war
was
concluded
in
may
palmerston
declared
that
it
would
be
a
happy
day
when
we
could
succeed
in
putting
an
end
to
this
unnatural
war
between
the
two
sections
of
our
north
american
cousins
but
added
that
the
difficulty
for
england
was
that
could
not
well
mix
ourselves
up
with
the
acknowledgment
of
slavery
great
britain
abhorrence
of
slavery
caused
indeed
a
perplexity
in
governmental
attitude
but
this
looked
to
the
final
outcome
of
an
independent
south
an
outcome
long
taken
for
granted
debate
on
the
existing
moralities
of
the
war
very
soon
largely
disappeared
from
british
discussion
and
in
its
place
there
cropped
out
here
and
there
expressions
indicative
of
anxiety
as
to
whether
the
war
could
long
continue
without
a
servile
insurrection
with
all
its
attendant
horrors
on
july
the
reviewing
the
progress
of
the
war
preparations
to
date
asserted
that
it
was
universally
agreed
no
restoration
of
the
union
was
possible
and
answered
british
fears
by
declaring
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
even
the
american
madness
could
contemplate
a
servile
insurrection
the
friendly
also
discussed
the
matter
and
repeatedly
it
was
a
mistaken
idea
said
this
journal
that
there
could
be
no
enfranchisement
without
a
slave
rising
but
should
this
occur
the
right
of
the
slave
to
regain
his
freedom
even
if
the
effort
involve
slaughter
is
as
clear
as
any
other
application
of
the
right
of
yet
english
abolitionists
should
not
urge
the
slave
to
act
for
himself
since
as
war
goes
on
and
all
compromise
fails
the
american
mind
will
harden
under
the
white
heat
and
determine
that
the
of
all
conflict
must
cease
that
slavery
in
spite
of
any
declaration
by
lincoln
or
northern
denial
of
a
purpose
to
attack
it
denials
which
disgusted
harriet
martineau
was
in
real
fact
the
basic
cause
of
the
war
seemed
to
her
as
clear
as
anything
in
reason
she
had
no
patience
with
english
people
who
believed
northern
protestations
and
she
did
not
express
concern
over
the
horrors
of
a
possible
servile
insurrection
nevertheless
this
spectre
was
constantly
appearing
again
the
sought
to
allay
such
fears
but
yet
again
also
proclaimed
that
even
such
a
contingency
was
less
fearful
than
the
consolidation
of
the
in
the
south
thus
a
servile
insurrection
was
early
and
frequently
an
argument
which
friends
were
compelled
to
meet
in
truth
the
bulk
of
the
british
press
was
constant
in
holding
up
this
bogie
to
its
readers
even
going
to
the
point
of
weakening
its
argument
of
the
impossibility
of
a
northern
conquest
of
the
south
by
appealing
to
history
to
show
that
england
in
her
two
wars
with
america
had
had
a
comparatively
easy
time
in
the
south
thus
postulating
the
real
danger
of
some
negro
garibaldi
calling
his
countrymen
to
arms
nor
was
this
fear
merely
a
pretended
one
it
affected
all
classes
and
partisans
of
both
sides
even
official
england
shared
in
it
january
lyons
wrote
the
question
is
rapidly
tending
towards
the
issue
either
of
peace
and
a
recognition
of
the
separation
or
a
proclamation

emancipation
and
the
raising
of
a
servile
insurrection
at
nearly
the
same
time
russell
returning
to
gladstone
a
letter
from
sumner
to
cobden
expressed
his
sorrow
that
the
president
intends
a
war
of
emancipation
meaning
thereby
i
fear
a
war
of
greater
desolation
than
has
been
since
the
revival
of
letters
john
stuart
mill
with
that
clear
logic
which
appealed
to
the
more
intelligent
reader
in
an
able
examination
of
the
underlying
causes
and
probable
results
of
the
american
conflict
excused
the
northern
leaders
for
early
denial
of
a
purpose
to
attack
slavery
but
expressed
complete
confidence
that
even
these
leaders
by
now
understood
the
almost
certain
results
of
success
in
the
present
conflict
the
extinction
of
slavery
and
prophesied
that
if
the
writers
who
so
severely
criticize
the
present
moderation
of
the
are
desirous
to
see
the

become
an

it
is
probable
that
if
the
war
lasts
long
enough
they
will
be
gratified
john
bright
reaching
a
wider
public
in
speech
after
speech
expressed
faith
that
the
people
of
the
north
were
marching
on
as
i
believe
to
its
slavery
entire
abolition
englishmen
pictured
the
horrors
of
an
abolition
war
and
believed
the
picture
true
strict
neutrals
like
lyons
feared
the
same
development
friends
of
the
north
pushed
aside
the
thought
of
a
negro
terror
yet
even
while
hoping
and
declaring
that
the
war
would
destroy
slavery
could
not
escape
from
apprehensions
of
an
event
that
appeared
inevitable
everywhere
to
the
british
mind
it
seemed
that
emancipation
was
necessarily
a
provocative
to
servile
insurrection
and
this
belief
largely
affected
the
reception
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
a
fact
almost
wholly
lost
sight
of
in
historical
writing
nor
did
the
steps
taken
in
america
leading
up
to
emancipation
weaken
this
belief
rather
they
appeared
to
justify
it
the
great
advocate
of
abolition
as
a
weapon
in
the
war
and
for
its
own
sake
was
charles
sumner
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
foreign
relations
he
early
took
the
ground
that
a
proclamation
everywhere
emancipating
the
slaves
would
give
to
the
northern
cause
a
moral
support
hitherto
denied
it
in
europe
and
would
at
the
same
time
strike
a
blow
at
southern
resistance
this
idea
was
presented
in
a
public
speech
at
worcester
massachusetts
in
october
but
even
sumner
friends
thought
him
mistaken
and
his
expressions
unfortunate
by
december
however
he
found
at
washington
a
change
in
governmental
temper
and
from
that
date
sumner
was
constant
through
frequent
private
conversations
with
lincoln
in
pressing
for
action
these
ideas
and
his
personal
activities
for
their
realization
were
well
known
to
english
friends
as
in
his
letters
to
cobden
and
bright
and
to
the
english
public
in
general
through
sumner
speeches
for
sumner
had
long
been
a
figure
in
the
british
press
lincoln
never
an
abolitionist
in
spite
of
his
famous
utterance
in
the
that
the
united
states
could
not
indefinitely
continue
to
exist
and
had
in
disapproved
and
recalled
the
orders
of
some
of
the
military
leaders
like
fremont
who
without
authority
had
sought
to
extend
emancipation
to
slaves
within
the
lines
of
their
command
but
as
early
as
anyone
he
had
foreseen
the
gradual
emergence
of
emancipation
as
a
war
problem
at
first
dangerous
to
that
wise
border
state
policy
which
had
prevented
the
more
northern
of
the
slave
states
from
seceding
his
first
duty
was
to
restore
the
union
and
to
that
he
gave
all
his
energy
yet
that
emancipation
when
the
time
was
ripe
was
also
in
lincoln
mind
is
evident
from
the
gradual
approach
through
legislation
and
administrative
act
in
february
a
bill
was
under
discussion
in
congress
called
the
confiscation
bill
which
among
other
clauses
provided
that
all
slaves
of
persons
engaged
in
rebellion
against
the
united
states
who
should
by
escape
or
capture
come
into
the
possession
of
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states
should
be
for
ever
free
but
that
this
provision
should
not
be
operative
until
the
expiration
of
sixty
days
thus
giving
opportunity
to
cease
their
rebellion
and
retain
their
slaves
this
measure
did
not
at
first
have
lincoln
approval
for
he
feared
its
effect
on
the
loyalists
of
the
border
states
nevertheless
he
realized
the
growing
strength
of
sentiment
in
the
war
and
fully
sympathized
with
it
where
actual
realization
did
not
conflict
with
the
one
great
object
of
his
administration
hence
in
march
he
heartily
concurred
in
a
measure
passed
rapidly
to
presidential
approval
april
freeing
the
slaves
in
the
district
of
columbia
a
territory
where
there
was
no
question
of
the
constitutional
power
of
the
national
government
from
february
until
the
issue
of
the
first
emancipation
proclamation
in
september
there
was
in
truth
a
genuine
conflict
between
congress
and
president
as
to
methods
and
extent
of
emancipation
congress
was
in
a
mood
to
punish
the
south
lincoln
looking
steadily
toward
yet
realizing
the
rising
strength
of
in
the
north
advocated
a
gradual
voluntary
and
compensated
emancipation
neither
party
spoke
the
word
servile
insurrection
yet
both
realized
its
possibility
and
seward
in
foreign
affairs
was
quick
to
see
and
use
it
as
a
threat
a
brief
summary
of
measures
will
indicate
the
contest
march
lincoln
sent
a
message
to
congress
recommending
that
a
joint
resolution
be
passed
pledging
the
pecuniary
aid
of
the
national
government
to
any
state
voluntarily
emancipating
its
slaves
his
avowed
purpose
being
to
secure
early
action
by
the
loyal
border
states
in
the
hope
that
this
might
influence
the
southern
states
neither
the
house
of
representatives
nor
the
senate
were
really
favourable
to
this
resolution
and
the
border
states
bitterly
opposed
it
in
debate
but
it
passed
by
substantial
majorities
in
both
branches
and
was
approved
by
lincoln
on
april
in
effect
the
extreme
radical
element
in
congress
had
yielded
momentarily
to
the
president
insistence
on
an
offering
of
compensated
emancipation
both
as
regards
the
border
states
and
looking
to
the
restoration
of
the
union
lincoln
was
determined
to
give
this
line
of
policy
a
trial
the
prevailing
sentiment
of
congress
however
preferred
the
punitive
confiscation
bill
at
this
juncture
general
hunter
in
command
of
the
department
of
the
south
which
theoretically
included
also
the
states
of
south
carolina
georgia
and
florida
issued
an
order
declaring
the
slaves
in
these
states
free
this
was
may
lincoln
immediately
countermanded
hunter
order
stating
that
such
action
under
my
responsibility
i
reserve
to
myself
he
renewed
in
this
same
proclamation
earnest
appeals
to
the
border
states
to
embrace
the
opportunity
offered
by
the
congressional
resolution
of
april
in
truth
border
state
attitude
was
the
test
of
the
feasibility
of
lincoln
voluntary
emancipation
but
these
states
were
unwilling
to
accept
the
plan
meanwhile
pressure
was
being
exerted
for
action
on
the
confiscation
bill
it
was
pushed
through
congress
and
presented
to
lincoln
for
his
signature
or
veto
he
signed
it
on
july
did
not
notify
that
fact
to
congress
until
july
on
this
same
day
of
signature
july
lincoln
sent
to
congress
a
proposal
of
an
act
to
give
pecuniary
aid
in
voluntary
state
emancipation
and
held
a
conference
with
the
congressional
representatives
of
the
border
states
seeking
their
definite
approval
of
his
policy
a
minority
agreed
but
the
majority
were
emphatically
against
him
the
confiscation
bill
would
not
affect
the
border
states
they
were
not
in
rebellion
and
they
did
not
desire
to
free
the
slaves
even
if
compensated
thus
lincoln
by
the
stubbornness
of
the
border
states
was
forced
toward
the
congressional
point
of
view
as
expressed
in
the
confiscation
bill
on
the
day
following
his
failure
to
win
the
border
state
representatives
he
told
seward
and
welles
who
were
driving
with
him
that
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
time
was
near
for
the
issue
of
a
proclamation
of
emancipation
as
a
military
measure
fully
within
the
competence
of
the
president
this
was
on
july
seward
offered
a
few
objections
but
apparently
neither
cabinet
official
did
more
than
listen
to
lincoln
argument
of
military
necessity
congress
adjourned
on
july
on
july
the
president
read
to
the
cabinet
a
draft
of
an
emancipation
proclamation
the
text
of
the
first
paragraph
of
which
referred
to
the
confiscation
act
and
declared
that
this
would
be
rigorously
executed
unless
rebellious
subjects
returned
to
their
allegiance
but
the
remainder
of
the
draft
reasserted
the
ideal
of
a
gradual
and
compensated
emancipation
and
concluded
with
the
warning
that
for
states
still
in
rebellion
on
january
a
general
emancipation
of
slaves
would
be
proclaimed
all
of
the
cabinet
approved
except
blair
who
expressed
fears
of
the
effect
on
the
approaching
november
elections
and
seward
who
while
professing
sympathy
with
the
indicated
purpose
argued
that
the
time
was
badly
chosen
in
view
of
recent
military
disasters
and
the
approach
of
lee
army
toward
washington
the
measure
seward
said
might
be
viewed
as
the
last
measure
of
an
exhausted
government
a
cry
for
help
the
government
stretching
forth
its
hands
to
ethiopia
instead
of
ethiopia
stretching
forth
her
hands
to
the
government
it
will
be
considered
our
last
on
the
retreat
he
therefore
urged
postponement
until
after
a
northern
victory
this
appealed
to
lincoln
and
he
put
the
draft
of
the
proclamation
aside
waiting
for
victory
victory
came
in
september
with
mcclellan
defeat
of
lee
at
antietam
and
the
retreat
of
the
southern
army
toward
richmond
five
days
later
september
lincoln
issued
the
proclamation
expanded
and
altered
in
text
from
the
draft
of
july
but
in
substance
the
same
the
loyal
border
states
were
not
to
be
affected
but
the
proclamation
renewed
the
promise
of
steps
to
be
taken
to
persuade
them
to
voluntary
action
on
january
a
second
proclamation
referring
to
that
of
september
was
issued
by
lincoln
by
virtue
of
the
power
in
me
vested
as
of
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
in
time
of
actual
armed
rebellion
against
the
authority
and
government
of
the
united
states
the
states
affected
were
designated
by
name
and
all
persons
held
as
slaves
within
them
are
and
henceforward
shall
be
free
i
hereby
enjoin
upon
the
people
so
declared
to
be
free
to
abstain
from
all
violence
unless
in
necessary
and
upon
this
act
sincerely
believed
to
be
an
act
of
justice
warranted
by
the
constitution
upon
military
necessity
i
invoke
the
considerate
judgment
of
mankind
and
the
gracious
favour
of
almighty
god
such
were
the
steps
from
december
when
the
radical
sumner
began
his
pressure
for
action
to
september
when
lincoln
pledge
of
emancipation
was
made
did
these
steps
indicate
as
british
opinion
unquestionably
held
an
intention
to
rouse
a
servile
insurrection
was
the
confiscation
bill
passed
with
that
purpose
in
view
and
had
lincoln
decided
to
carry
it
into
effect
the
failure
of
the
slaves
to
rise
is
indeed
the
great
marvel
of
the
civil
war
and
was
so
regarded
not
in
england
only
but
in
america
also
it
was
the
expectation
of
the
north
and
the
constant
fear
of
the
south
but
was
this
in
truth
the
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
this
purpose
has
been
somewhat
summarily
treated
by
american
historians
largely
because
of
lack
of
specific
evidence
as
to
motives
at
the
time
of
issue
two
words
military
necessity
are
made
to
cover
nearly
the
entire
argument
for
emancipation
in
september
but
in
just
what
manner
the
military
prowess
of
the
north
was
to
be
increased
was
not
at
first
indicated
in
lincoln
declared
that
after
the
failure
of
successive
efforts
to
persuade
the
border
states
to
accept
compensated
emancipation
he
had
believed
there
had
arrived
the
indispensable
necessity
for
military
emancipation
and
arming
the
blacks
repeatedly
in
later
defence
of
the
proclamation
he
urged
the
benefits
that
had
come
from
his
act
and
asserted
that
commanders
in
the
field
believe
the
emancipation
policy
and
the
use
of
coloured
troops
constitute
the
heaviest
blow
yet
dealt
to
the
rebellion
he
added
negroes
like
other
people
act
upon
motives
why
should
they
do
anything
for
us
if
we
will
do
nothing
for
them
if
they
stake
their
lives
for
us
they
must
be
prompted
by
the
strongest
motive
even
the
promise
of
freedom
there
is
no
note
here
of
stirring
a
servile
insurrection
nor
did
lincoln
ever
acknowledge
that
such
a
purpose
had
been
in
his
mind
though
the
thought
of
such
possible
result
must
have
been
present
was
indeed
present
to
most
minds
even
without
a
proclamation
of
emancipation
lincoln
alleged
purpose
was
simply
to
draw
away
slaves
wherever
possible
from
their
rebellious
masters
thus
reducing
the
economic
powers
of
resistance
of
the
south
and
then
to
make
these
directly
useful
in
winning
the
war
but
after
the
war
even
here
and
there
during
it
a
theory
was
advanced
that
an
impelling
motive
with
the
president
had
been
the
hope
of
influencing
favourably
foreign
governments
and
peoples
by
stamping
the
northern
cause
with
a
high
moral
purpose
in
popular
opinion
lincoln
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
statesman
in
anticipating
that
which
ultimately
came
to
pass
this
has
important
bearing
on
the
relations
of
the
united
states
and
great
britain
there
is
no
doubt
that
nearly
every
northern
american
had
believed
in
that
england
would
sympathize
strongly
with
the
north
the
event
did
not
prove
this
to
be
the
case
nor
could
the
north
justly
complain
in
the
face
of
administration
denials
of
an
purpose
the
english
government
therefore
was
widely
upheld
by
british
opinion
in
regarding
the
struggle
from
the
point
of
view
of
british
interests
yet
any
northern
step
antagonistic
to
the
institution
of
slavery
compelled
british
governmental
consideration
as
early
as
december
before
the
war
began
bunch
at
charleston
had
reported
a
conversation
with
rhett
in
which
the
latter
frankly
declared
that
the
south
would
expect
to
revive
the
african
slave
trade
this
was
limited
in
the
constitution
later
adopted
by
the
confederacy
which
in
substance
left
the
matter
to
the
individual
states
a
condition
that
southern
agents
in
england
found
it
hard
to
explain
as
already
noted
the
ardent
friends
of
the
north
continued
to
insist
even
after
lincoln
denial
that
slavery
was
the
real
cause
of
the
american
rupture
by
september
john
bright
was
writing
to
his
friend
sumner
that
all
indications
to
the
contrary
england
would
warmly
support
the
north
if
only
it
could
be
shown
that
emancipation
was
an
object
again
and
again
he
urged
it
is
interesting
to
note
just
those
ideals
of
gradual
and
compensated
emancipation
which
were
so
strongly
held
by
lincoln
in
this
same
month
the
thought
it
was
idle
to
strive
to
ignore
the
very
centre
and
spring
of
all
disunion
and
advised
a
prudent
audacity
in
striking
at
the
cause
rather
than
at
the
effect
three
weeks
later
the
reviewing
general
british
press
comments
summed
them
up
as
follows
if
you
make
it
a
war
of
emancipation
we
shall
think
you
madmen
and
tell
you
so
though
the
ignorant
instincts
of
englishmen
will
support
you
and
if
you
follow
our
counsel
in
holding
a
tight
rein
on
the
abolitionists
we
shall
applaud
your
worldly
wisdom
so
far
but
shall
deem
it
our
duty
to
set
forth
continually
that
you
have
forfeited
all
claim
to
the
sympathy
of
england
this
said
the
had
been
stated
in
the
most
objectionable
style
by
the
in
particular
which
editorially
had
alleged
that
the
north
has
now
lost
the
chance
of
establishing
a
high
moral
superiority
by
a
declaration
against
slavery
to
all
this
the
declared
that
the
north
must
adopt
the
bold
course
and
make
clear
that
restoration
of
the
union
was
not
intended
with
the
old
canker
at
its
roots
official
england
held
a
different
view
russell
believed
that
the
separation
of
north
and
south
would
conduce
to
the
extinction
of
slavery
since
the
south
left
to
itself
and
fronted
by
a
great
and
prosperous
free
north
with
a
population
united
in
ideals
would
be
forced
ultimately
to
abandon
its
special
system
he
professed
that
he
could
not
understand
stowe
support
of
the
war
and
thought
she
and
sumner
animated
by
a
spirit
of
vengeance
if
the
south
did
yield
and
the
union
were
restored
slavery
russell
thought
that
slavery
would
prevail
all
over
the
new
world
for
that
reason
i
wish
for
separation
these
views
were
repeated
frequently
by
russell
he
long
had
a
fixed
idea
on
the
moral
value
of
separation
but
was
careful
to
state
i
give
you
these
views
merely
as
speculations
and
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
after
midsummer
of
he
rarely
indulged
in
them
against
such
speculations
whether
by
russell
or
by
others
mill
protested
in
his
famous
article
in
february
on
one
aspect
of
slavery
the
north
was
free
to
act
and
early
did
so
seward
proposed
to
lyons
a
treaty
giving
mutual
right
of
search
off
the
african
coast
and
on
the
coasts
of
cuba
for
the
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
such
a
treaty
had
long
been
urged
by
great
britain
but
persistently
refused
by
the
united
states
it
could
not
well
be
declined
now
by
the
british
government
and
was
signed
by
seward
april
but
if
he
expected
any
change
in
british
attitude
as
a
result
he
was
disappointed
the
renewal
by
the
south
of
that
trade
might
be
a
barrier
to
british
goodwill
but
the
action
of
the
north
was
viewed
as
but
a
weak
attempt
to
secure
british
sympathy
and
to
mark
the
limits
of
northern
efforts
indeed
the
government
was
not
eager
for
the
treaty
on
other
grounds
since
the
admiralty
had
never
felt
any
interest
in
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
whatever
they
have
done
they
have
done
grudgingly
and
imperfectly
this
was
written
at
the
exact
period
when
palmerston
and
russell
were
initiating
those
steps
which
were
to
result
in
the
cabinet
crisis
on
mediation
in
certainly
the
slave
trade
treaty
with
america
had
not
influenced
governmental
attitude
at
this
juncture
there
was
founded
november
the
london
emancipation
society
with
the
avowed
object
of
stirring
englishmen
in
protest
against
favouring
the
south
but
george
thompson
its
organizer
had
been
engaged
in
the
preliminary
work
of
organization
for
some
months
and
the
society
is
therefore
to
be
regarded
as
an
expression
of
that
small
group
who
were
persistent
and
determined
in
assertion
of
slavery
as
the
cause
and
object
of
the
civil
war
before
the
issue
of
proclamation
thus
for
england
as
a
whole
and
for
official
england
the
declarations
of
these
few
voices
were
regarded
as
expressive
of
a
wish
rather
than
as
consistent
with
the
facts
the
moral
uplift
of
an
object
was
denied
to
the
north
this
being
so
did
lincoln
seek
to
correct
the
foreign
view
by
the
emancipation
proclamation
there
is
some
but
scant
ground
for
so
believing
it
is
true
that
this
aspect
had
at
various
times
though
rarely
been
presented
to
the
president
carl
schurz
american
minister
at
madrid
wrote
to
seward
as
early
as
september
strongly
urging
the
declaration
of
an
purpose
in
the
war
and
asserting
that
public
opinion
in
europe
would
then
be
such
in
favour
of
the
north
that
no
government
would
dare
to
place
itself
by
declaration
or
act
upon
the
side
of
a
universally
condemned
institution
there
is
no
evidence
that
seward
showed
this
despatch
to
lincoln
but
in
january
schurz
returned
to
america
and
in
conversation
with
the
president
urged
the
moral
issue
to
prevent
foreign
intervention
the
president
replied
you
may
be
right
probably
you
are
i
have
been
thinking
so
myself
i
can
not
imagine
that
any
european
power
would
dare
to
recognize
and
aid
the
southern
confederacy
if
it
became
clear
that
the
confederacy
stands
for
slavery
and
the
union
for
freedom
no
doubt
others
urged
upon
him
the
same
view
indeed
one
sincere
foreign
friend
count
gasparin
who
had
early
written
in
favour
of
the
north
and
whose
opinions
were
widely
read
produced
a
second
work
in
the
spring
of
in
which
the
main
theme
was
slavery
the
issue
the
author
believed
emancipation
inevitable
and
urged
an
instant
proclamation
of
northern
to
free
the
slaves
presumably
lincoln
was
familiar
with
this
work
meanwhile
sumner
pressed
the
same
idea
though
adding
the
prevalent
abolition
arguments
which
did
not
necessarily
involve
thought
of
foreign
effect
on
the
general
question
of
emancipation
lincoln
listened
even
telling
sumner
that
he
was
ahead
of
himself
only
a
month
or
six
weeks
yet
after
the
enactment
of
the
confiscation
bill
in
july
when
strong
abolitionist
pressure
was
brought
on
the
president
to
issue
a
general
proclamation
of
emancipation
he
reasserted
in
the
famous

august
his
one
single
purpose
to
restore
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
if
there
be
those
who
would
not
save
the
union
unless
they
could
at
the
same
time
save
slavery
i
do
not
agree
with
them
if
there
be
those
who
would
not
save
the
union
unless
they
could
at
the
same
time
destroy
slavery
i
do
not
agree
with
them
paramount
object
is
to
save
the
union
and
not
either
to
save
or
to
destroy
here
seemed
to
be
specific
denial
of
raising
a
moral
issue
yet
unknown
to
the
public
at
the
moment
there
had
already
been
drafted
and
discussed
in
cabinet
the
emancipation
proclamation
greeley
had
presented
abolitionist
demands
essential
to
cement
the
north
a
month
later
september
a
delegation
of
chicago
clergymen
came
to
washington
had
an
audience
with
lincoln
presented
similar
arguments
but
also
laid
stress
on
the
necessity
of
securing
the
sympathy
of
europe
this
was
but
nine
days
before
the
first
proclamation
was
issued
but
lincoln
replied
much
as
to
greeley
though
he
stated
i
will
also
concede
that
emancipation
would
help
us
in
europe
and
convince
them
that
we
are
incited
by
something
more
than
ambition
immediately
after
the
event
september
making
a
short
speech
to
a
serenading
party
lincoln
said
i
can
only
trust
in
god
i
have
made
no
mistake
it
is
now
for
the
country
and
the
world
to
pass
judgment
and
maybe
take
action
upon
it
over
a
year
later
december
in
his
annual
message
to
congress
he
noted
a
much
improved
tone
in
foreign
countries
as
resulting
from
the
emancipation
proclamation
but
dwelt
mainly
on
the
beneficial
effects
at
home
evidently
there
is
slight
ground
for
believing
lincoln
to
have
been
convinced
that
foreign
relations
would
be
improved
by
the
proclamation
on
the
contrary
if
he
trusted
seward
judgment
he
may
have
the
effect
on
europe
for
such
was
seward
prophecy
here
may
have
lain
the
true
meaning
of
lincoln
speech
of
september
that
it
was
now
for
the
world
to
pass
judgment
and
maybe
take
action
upon
it
after
all
foreign
policy
though
its
main
lines
were
subject
to
the
president
control
was
in
the
hands
of
seward
and
throughout
this
entire
period
of
six
months
since
the
introduction
of
the
confiscation
bill
up
to
lincoln
presentation
of
his
draft
proclamation
to
the
cabinet
in
july
seward
had
been
using
the
threat
of
a
servile
insurrection
as
a
deterrent
upon
talk
of
intervention
at
times
seward
connected
servile
insurrection
with
emancipation
at
times
not
seward
had
begun
his
career
as
secretary
of
state
with
an
appeal
to
europe
on
lines
of
old
friendship
and
had
implied
though
he
could
not
state
explicitly
the
noble
cause
of
the
north
he
had
been
met
with
what
he
considered
a
cold
and
premature
as
well
as
unjustifiable
declaration
of
neutrality
from
the
first
day
of
the
conflict
lyons
and
mercier
had
been
constant
in
representing
the
hardships
inflicted
by
the
american
war
upon
the
economic
interests
of
their
respective
countries
both
men
bore
down
upon
the
interruption
of
the
cotton
trade
and
seward
kept
repeating
that
northern
victories
would
soon
release
the
raw
cotton
he
expected
and
promised
much
from
the
capture
of
new
orleans
but
the
results
were
disappointing
as
time
went
on
seward
became
convinced
that
material
interests
alone
would
determine
the
attitude
and
action
of
great
britain
and
france
but
the
stored
supplies
were
on
hand
in
the
south
locked
in
by
the
blockade
and
would
be
available
when
the
war
was
over
the
war
did
not
take
on
an
uncivilized
and
sanguinary
character
through
a
rising
of
the
slaves
if
that
occurred
cotton
would
be
burned
and
destroyed
and
cotton
supply
to
europe
would
be
not
merely
a
matter
of
temporary
interruption
but
one
of
dearth
with
no
certainty
of
early
resumption
fearing
the
growth
in
england
especially
of
an
intention
to
intervene
seward
threatened
a
northern
appeal
to
the
slaves
thinking
of
the
threat
not
so
much
in
terms
of
an
uncivilized
and
horrible
war
as
in
terms
of
the
material
interests
of
great
britain
in
brief
considering
foreign
attitude
and
action
in
its
relation
to
northern
advantage
to
the
winning
of
the
war
he
would
use
emancipation
as
a
threat
of
servile
insurrection
but
did
not
desire
emancipation
itself
for
fear
it
would
cause
that
very
intervention
which
it
was
his
object
to
prevent
his
instructions
are
wholly
in
line
with
this
policy
in
february
the
confiscation
bill
had
been
introduced
in
congress
in
april
mercier
trip
to
richmond
had
caused
much
speculation
and
started
many
rumours
in
london
of
plans
of
mediation
on
may
seward
wrote
to
adams
at
great
length
and
especially
emphasized
two
points
first
that
while
diplomats
abroad
had
hitherto
been
interdicted
from
discussing
slavery
as
an
issue
in
the
war
they
were
now
authorized
to
state
that
the
war
was
in
part
at
least
intended
for
the
suppression
of
slavery
and
secondly
that
the
north
if
interfered
with
by
foreign
nations
would
be
forced
to
have
recourse
to
a
servile
war
such
a
war
seward
argued
would
be
completely
destructive
of
all
european
interests
a
copy
of
this
instruction
adams
gave
to
russell
on
june
eight
days
later
adams
told
cobden
in
reply
to
a
query
about
mediation
that
it
would
result
in
a
servile
war
evidently
adams
perfectly
understood
seward
policy
on
july
lincoln
told
seward
and
welles
of
the
planned
emancipation
proclamation
and
that
this
was
his
first
mention
of
it
to
anyone
seward
commented
favourably
but
wished
to
consider
the
proposal
in
all
its
bearings
before
committing
himself
the
day
following
he
transmitted
to
agents
abroad
a
copy
of
the
bill
that
day
introduced
into
congress
embodying
lincoln
plan
for
gradual
and
compensated
emancipation
this
was
prompt
transmittal
and
was
unusual
seward
sent
the
bill
without
material
comment
but
it
is
apparent
that
this
method
and
measure
of
emancipation
would
much
better
fit
in
with
his
theory
of
the
slavery
question
in
relation
to
foreign
powers
than
would
an
outright
proclamation
of
emancipation
meanwhile
american
anxiety
as
to
a
possible
alteration
in
british
neutral
policy
was
increasing
july
adams
reported
that
he
had
learned
from
a
credible
source
that
the
british
cabinet
might
soon
take
new
ground
this
despatch
if
it
reached
seward
previous
to
the
cabinet
of
july
presumably
added
strength
to
his
conviction
of
the
inadvisability
of
now
issuing
the
proclamation
in
that
cabinet
seward
in
fact
went
much
beyond
the
customary
historical
statement
that
he
advised
postponement
of
the
proclamation
until
the
occurrence
of
a
northern
victory
he
argued
according
to
secretary
of
war
notes
of
the
meeting
that
foreign
nations
will
intervene
to
prevent
the
abolition
of
slavery
for
the
sake
of
cotton
we
break
up
our
relations
with
foreign
nations
and
the
production
of
cotton
for
sixty
years
these
views
did
not
prevail
lincoln
merely
postponed
action
ten
days
later
seward
sent
that
long
instruction
to
adams
covering
the
whole
ground
of
feared
european
intervention
which
fortunately
adams
was
never
called
upon
to
carry
out
in
it
there
was
renewed
the
threat
of
a
servile
war
if
europe
attempted
to
aid
the
south
and
again
it
is
the
materialistic
view
that
is
emphasized
seward
was
clinging
to
his
theory
of
correct
policy
nor
was
he
mistaken
in
his
view
of
first
reactions
in
governmental
circles
abroad
at
least
in
england
on
july
the
day
before
lincoln
proposal
of
emancipation
in
the
cabinet
stuart
in
reviewing
military
prospects
wrote
amongst
the
means
relied
upon
for
weakening
the
south
is
included
a
servile
war
to
this
russell
replied
i
have
to
observe
that
the
prospect
of
a
servile
war
will
only
make
other
nations
more
desirous
to
see
an
end
of
this
desolating
and
destructive
conflict
this
was
but
brief
reiteration
of
a
more
exact
statement
by
russell
made
in
comment
on
seward
first
hint
of
servile
war
in
his
despatch
to
adams
of
may
a
copy
of
which
had
been
given
to
russell
on
june
on
july
russell
reviewing
arguments
commented
on
the
fast
increasing
bitterness
of
the
american
conflict
disturbing
and
unsettling
to
european
governments
and
wrote
the
approach
of
a
servile
war
so
much
insisted
upon
by
seward
in
his
despatch
only
forewarns
us
that
another
element
of
destruction
may
be
added
to
the
slaughter
loss
of
property
and
waste
of
industry
which
already
afflict
a
country
so
lately
prosperous
and
tranquil
in
this
same
despatch
unfavourable
comment
was
made
also
on
the
confiscation
bill
with
its
punitive
emancipation
clauses
stuart
presented
a
copy
of
the
despatch
to
seward
on
august
on
august
stuart
learned
of
lincoln
plan
and
reported
it
as
purely
a
manoeuvre
to
affect
home
politics
and
to
frighten
foreign
governments
where
did
stuart
get
the
news
if
not
from
seward
since
he
also
reported
the
latter
success
in
postponing
the
proclamation
in
brief
both
seward
and
russell
were
regarding
emancipation
in
the
light
of
an
incitement
to
servile
insurrection
and
both
believed
such
an
event
would
add
to
the
argument
for
foreign
intervention
the
seward
had
regarded
as
useful
the
would
be
highly
dangerous
to
the
north
not
so
however
did
emancipation
appear
in
prospect
to
american
diplomats
abroad
adams
was
a
faithful
servant
in
attempting
to
carry
out
the
ideas
and
plans
of
his
chief
but
as
early
as
february
he
had
urged
a
northern
declaration
in
regard
to
slavery
in
order
to
meet
in
england
southern
private
representations
that
independence
won
the
south
would
enter
upon
a
plan
of
gradual
emancipation
to
be
applied
to
all
persons
born
after
some
specific
date
motley
at
vienna
frequently
after
february
in
private
letters
to
his
friends
in
america
urged
some
forward
step
on
slavery
but
no
such
advice
in
despatches
found
its
way
into
the
selected
correspondence
annually
sent
to
print
by
seward
far
more
important
was
the
determination
taken
by
adams
less
than
a
month
after
he
had
presented
to
russell
the
servile
war
threat
policy
of
seward
to
give
advice
to
his
chief
that
the
chances
of
foreign
intervention
would
be
best
met
by
the
distinct
avowal
of
an
object
in
the
war
and
that
the
north
should
be
prepared
to
meet
an
european
offer
of
mediation
by
declaring
that
if
made
to
extinguish
slavery
such
mediation
would
be
welcome
this
adams
thought
would
probably
put
an
end
to
the
mediation
itself
but
it
would
also
greatly
strengthen
the
northern
position
abroad
this
was
no
prevision
of
an
emancipation
proclamation
but
it
was
assertion
of
the
value
of
a
higher
moral
issue
meanwhile
on
july
seward
still
fearful
of
the
effects
abroad
of
emancipation
wrote
to
motley
asking
whether
he
was
sure
that
european
powers
would
not
be
encouraged
in
interference
because
of
material
interests
by
a
northern
attempt
to
free
the
slaves
motley
answer
began
a
thousand
times
no
and
adams
repeated
his
plea
for
a
moral
issue
september
adams
met
seward
material
interests
argument
by
declaring
that
for
great
britain
the
chief
difficulty
in
the
cotton
situation
was
not
scarcity
but
uncertainty
and
that
if
english
manufacturers
could
but
know
what
to
expect
there
would
be
little
cotton
pressure
on
the
government
thus
leading
diplomats
abroad
did
not
agree
with
seward
but
the
later
advices
of
adams
were
not
yet
received
when
the
day
september
arrived
on
which
lincoln
issued
the
proclamation
on
that
day
in
sending
the
text
to
adams
the
comment
of
seward
was
brief
the
proclamation
he
said
put
into
effect
a
policy
the
approach
of
which
he
had
heretofore
indicated
to
our
representatives
abroad
and
he
laid
emphasis
on
the
idea
that
the
main
purpose
of
the
proclamation
was
to
convince
the
south
that
its
true
interests
were
in
the
preservation
of
the
union
which
is
to
say
that
the
result
was
the
return
of
the
south
its
certainly
this
was
far
from
a
truthful
representation
but
its
purpose
is
evident
first
thought
was
that
having
held
up
the
threat
of
servile
insurrection
he
must
now
remove
that
bogie
four
days
later
his
judgment
was
improved
for
he
began
and
thereafter
maintained
with
vigour
the
high
moral
purpose
argument
as
evinced
in
the
emancipation
proclamation
the
interests
of
humanity
he
wrote
to
adams
have
now
become
identified
with
the
cause
of
our
country
that
the
material
interests
of
great
britain
were
still
in
thought
is
shown
by
the
celerity
with
which
under
lincoln
orders
he
grasped
at
an
unexpected
opening
in
relation
to
liberated
slaves
stuart
wrote
in
that
walker
secretary
of
the
colony
of
british
guiana
was
coming
from
demerara
to
washington
to
secure
additional
labour
for
the
british
colony
by
offering
to
carry
away
this
scheme
was
no
secret
and
five
days
after
the
issue
of
the
proclamation
seward
proposed
to
stuart
a
convention
by
which
the
british
government
would
be
permitted
to
transport
to
the
west
indies
or
to
any
of
its
colonies
the
negroes
about
to
be
emancipated
on
september
adams
was
instructed
to
take
up
the
matter
at
london
russell
was
at
first
disinclined
to
consider
such
a
convention
and
discussion
dragged
until
the
spring
of
when
it
was
again
proposed
this
time
by
russell
but
now
declined
by
seward
in
its
immediate
influence
in
the
fall
of
seward
offer
had
no
effect
on
the
attitude
of
the
british
government
to
englishmen
and
americans
alike
it
has
been
in
later
years
a
matter
for
astonishment
that
the
emancipation
proclamation
did
not
at
once
convince
great
britain
of
the
high
purposes
of
the
north
but
if
it
be
remembered
that
in
the
north
itself
the
proclamation
was
greeted
save
by
a
small
abolitionist
faction
with
doubt
extending
even
to
bitter
opposition
and
that
british
governmental
and
public
opinion
had
long
dreaded
a
servile
insurrection
even
of
late
taking
its
cue
from
seward
own
prophecies
the
cool
reception
given
by
the
government
the
vehement
and
vituperative
explosions
of
the
press
do
not
seem
so
surprising
this
emancipation
proclamation
wrote
stuart
on
september
seems
a
brutum
fulmen
one
of
the
president
motives
he
thought
was
to
affect
public
opinion
in
england
but
there
is
no
pretext
of
humanity
about
the
proclamation
it
is
merely
a
confiscation
act
or
perhaps
worse
for
it
offers
direct
encouragement
to
servile
insurrections
received
in
england
during
the
cabinet
struggle
over
mediation
the
proclamation
appears
not
to
have
affected
that
controversy
though
russell
sought
to
use
it
as
an
argument
for
british
action
in
his
memorandum
circulated
october
russell
strove
to
show
that
the
purpose
and
result
would
be
servile
war
he
dwelt
both
on
the
horrors
of
such
a
war
and
on
its
destruction
of
industry
what
will
be
the
practical
effect
of
declaring
emancipation
not
as
an
act
of
justice
and
beneficence
dispensed
by
the
supreme
power
of
the
state
but
as
an
act
of
punishment
and
retaliation
inflicted
by
a
belligerent
upon
a
hostile
community
it
is
not
difficult
to
foresee
wherever
the
arms
of
the
united
states
penetrate
a
premium
will
be
given
to
acts
of
plunder
of
incendiarism
and
of
revenge
the
military
and
naval
authorities
of
the
united
states
will
be
bound
by
their
orders
to
maintain
and
protect
the
perpetrators
of
such
acts
wherever
the
invasion
of
the
southern
states
is
crowned
by
victory
society
will
be
disorganized
industry
suspended
large
and
small
proprietors
of
land
alike
reduced
to
beggary
the
london
newspaper
press
was
very
nearly
a
unit
in
treating
the
proclamation
with
derision
and
contempt
and
no
other
one
situation
in
the
civil
war
came
in
for
such
vigorous
denunciation
citations
setting
forth
such
comment
have
frequently
been
gathered
together
illustrative
of
the
extent
of
press
condemnation
and
of
its
unity
in
vicious
editorials
there
is
no
need
to
repeat
many
of
them
here
but
a
few
will
indicate
their
tone
the
greeted
the
news
with
an
assertion
that
this
was
a
final
desperate
play
by
lincoln
as
hope
of
victory
waned

his
last
card
a
phrase
that
caught
the
fancy
of

card
or
by
permission
of
the
proprietors
of
punch
we
have
here
the
history
of
the
beginning
of
the
end
but
who
can
tell
how
the
pages
will
be
written
which
are
yet
to
be
filled
before
the
inevitable
separation
is
accomplished
are
scenes
like
those
which
we
a
short
time
since
described
from
dahomey
yet
to
interpose
and
is
the
reign
of
the
last
president
to
go
out
amid
horrible
massacres
of
white
women
and
children
to
be
followed
by
the
extermination
of
the
black
race
in
the
south
is
lincoln
yet
a
name
not
known
to
us
as
it
will
be
known
to
posterity
and
is
it
ultimately
to
be
classed
among
that
catalogue
of
monsters
the
wholesale
assassins
and
butchers
of
their
kind
we
will
attempt
at
present
to
predict
nothing
as
to
what
the
consequence
of
lincoln
new
policy
may
be
except
that
it
certainly
will
not
have
the
effect
of
restoring
the
union
it
will
not
deprive
lincoln
of
the
distinctive
affix
which
he
will
share
with
many
for
the
most
part
foolish
and
incompetent
kings
and
emperors
caliphs
and
doges
that
of
being
lincoln
last
the
led
the
way
other
papers
followed
on
the
thought
a
slave
rising
inevitable
as
did
also
nearly
every
paper
acknowledging
sentiments
or
professedly
neutral
while
even
journals
at
first
feared
the
same
results
another
striking
phrase
brutum
fulmen
ran
through
many
editorials
the
talked
of
lincoln
cry
of
despair
which
was
little
different
from
seward
feared
last
shriek
thought
the
proclamation
monstrous
reckless
devilish
it
justifies
the
south
in
raising
the
black
flag
and
proclaiming
a
war
without
quarter
but
there
is
no
need
to
expand
the
citation
of
the
universal
british
press
pouring
out
of
the
wrath
of
heaven
upon
lincoln
and
his
emancipation
proclamation
even
though
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
bulk
of
england
at
first
expected
servile
war
to
follow
the
proclamation
it
is
apparent
that
here
and
there
a
part
of
this
british
wrath
was
due
to
a
fear
that
in
spite
of
denials
of
such
influence
the
proclamation
was
intended
to
arouse
public
opinion
against
projects
of
intervention
and
so
arouse
the
new
york
correspondent
of
the
wrote
that
it
was
promulgated
evidently
as
a
sop
to
keep
england
and
france
quiet
and
on
october
an
editorial
asserted
that
lincoln
had
a
very
important
object
there
is
a
presentiment
in
the
north
that
recognition
can
not
be
delayed
and
this
proclamation
is
aimed
not
at
the
negro
or
the
south
but
at
europe
weekly
believed
that
it
was
now
the
imperative
duty
of
england
and
france
to
do
what
they
can
in
order
to
prevent
the
possible
occurrence
of
a
crime
which
if
carried
out
would
surpass
in
atrocity
any
similar
horror
the
world
has
ever
seen
historicus
on
the
other
hand
asked
what
is
that
solution
of
the
negro
question
to
which
an
english
government
is
prepared
to
affix
the
seal
of
english
approbation
mason
the
confederate
agent
in
london
wrote
home
that
it
was
generally
believed
the
proclamation
was
issued
as
the
means
of
warding
off
recognition
it
was
seen
through
at
once
and
condemned
accordingly
this
interpretation
of
northern
purpose
in
no
sense
negatives
the
dictum
that
the
proclamation
exercised
little
influence
on
immediate
british
governmental
policy
but
does
offer
some
ground
for
the
belief
that
strong
sympathizers
at
once
saw
the
need
of
combating
an
argument
dangerous
to
the
carrying
out
of
projects
of
mediation
yet
the
new
moral
purpose
of
lincoln
did
not
immediately
appeal
even
to
his
friends
the
deplored
the
lack
of
a
declaration
in
favour
of
the
principle
of
human
freedom
the
principle
asserted
is
not
that
a
human
being
can
not
justly
own
another
but
that
he
can
not
own
him
unless
he
is
loyal
to
the
united
states
there
is
no
morality
whatever
in
such
a
decree
and
if
approved
at
all
it
must
be
upon
its
merits
as
a
political
measure
two
weeks
later
reporting
a
public
speech
at
liverpool
by
morehead
of
kentucky
in
which
lincoln
was
accused
of
treachery
to
the
border
states
the
while
taking
issue
with
the
speaker
statements
commented
that
it
was
not
to
be
understood
as
fully
defending
a
system
of
government
which
chose
its
executive
from
the
ranks
of
mechanics
similarly
in
america
the
emancipation
proclamation
though
loudly
applauded
by
the
abolitionists
was
received
with
misgivings
lincoln
was
disappointed
at
the
public
reaction
and
became
very
despondent
though
this
was
due
in
part
to
the
failure
of
mcclellan
to
follow
up
the
victory
of
antietam
the
elections
of
october
and
november
went
heavily
against
the
administration
and
largely
on
the
alleged
ground
of
the
president
surrender
to
the
radicals
the
army
as
a
whole
was
not
favourably
stirred
by
the
proclamation
it
was
considered
at
best
as
but
a
useless
bit
of
waste
paper
in
england
john
bright
the
most
ardent
public
advocate
of
the
northern
cause
was
slow
to
applaud
heartily
not
until
december
did
he
give
distinct
approval
and
even
then
in
but
fashion
though
he
thought
public
interest
was
much
aroused
and
that
attention
was
now
fixed
on
january
the
date
set
by
lincoln
for
actual
enforcement
of
emancipation
in
a
speech
at
birmingham
december
bright
had
little
to
say
of
emancipation
rather
he
continued
to
use
previous
arguments
against
the
south
for
admitting
as
stephens
had
declared
that
slavery
was
the
very
of
southern
institutions
and
society
a
few
public
meetings
at
points
where
favour
to
the
north
had
been
shown
were
tried
in
october
and
november
with
some
success
but
with
no
great
show
of
enthusiasm
it
was
not
until
late
december
that
the
wind
of
public
opinion
finding
that
no
faintest
had
been
created
by
the
proclamation
began
to
veer
in
favour
of
the
emancipation
edict
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
appeared
that
the
press
in
holding
up
horrified
hands
and
prophesying
a
servile
war
had
overshot
the
mark
soon
the
changing
wind
became
a
gale
of
public
favour
for
the
cause
of
emancipation
nor
was
this
lessened
rather
increased
by
jefferson
davis
proclamation
of
december
in
which
he
declared
that
lincoln
had
approved
of
the
effort
to
excite
a
servile
insurrection
and
that
therefore
it
was
now
ordered
all
negro
slaves
captured
in
arms
be
at
once
delivered
over
to
the
executive
authorities
of
the
respective
states
to
which
they
belong
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
the
laws
of
said
state
this
by
state
laws
meant
death
to
the
slave
fighting
for
his
freedom
even
as
a
regular
soldier
in
the
northern
armies
and
gave
a
good
handle
for
accusations
of
southern
ferocity
official
opinion
was
not
readily
altered
lyons
writing
in
december
that
the
promised
january
proclamation
might
still
mean
servile
war
he
hoped
that
neither
lincoln
proclamation
nor
davis
threat
of
retaliation
would
be
carried
into
effect
russell
regarded
the
january
proclamation
as
a
measure
of
war
of
a
very
questionable
kind
but
the
british
public
now
recovered
from
its
fears
of
an
abolition
war
was
of
another
temper
beginning
with
the
last
week
of
december
and
increasing
in
volume
in
each
succeeding
month
there
took
place
meeting
after
meeting
at
which
strong
resolutions
were
passed
enthusiastically
endorsing
the
issue
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
and
pledging
sympathy
to
the
cause
of
the
north
the
from
week
to
week
listed
and
commented
on
these
public
meetings
noting
held
between
december
and
march
the
american
minister
reported
even
more
many
of
which
sent
to
him
engraved
resolutions
or
presented
them
in
person
through
selected
delegations
the
resolutions
were
much
of
the
type
of
that
adopted
at
sheffield
january
that
this
meeting
being
convinced
that
slavery
is
the
cause
of
the
tremendous
struggle
now
going
on
in
the
american
states
and
that
the
object
of
the
leaders
of
the
rebellion
is
the
perpetuation
of
the
unchristian
and
inhuman
system
of
chattel
slavery
earnestly
prays
that
the
rebellion
may
be
crushed
and
its
wicked
object
defeated
and
that
the
federal
government
may
be
strengthened
to
pursue
its
emancipation
policy
till
not
a
slave
be
left
on
the
american
soil
adams
quoted
the
as
referring
to
these
meetings
as
made
up
of
nobodies
adams
commented
they
do
not
indeed
belong
to
the
high
and
noble
class
but
they
are
just
those
nobodies
who
formerly
forced
their
most
exalted
countrymen
to
denounce
the
prosecution
of
the
slave
trade
by
the
commercial
adventurers
at
liverpool
and
bristol
and
who
at
a
later
period
overcame
all
their
resistance
to
the
complete
emancipation
of
the
negro
slaves
in
the
british
dependencies
if
they
become
once
fully
aroused
to
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
this
struggle
as
a
purely
moral
question
i
feel
safe
in
saying
there
will
be
an
end
of
all
effective
sympathy
in
great
britain
with
the
rebellion
adams
had
no
doubt
that
these
manifestations
are
the
genuine
expression
of
the
feelings
of
the
religious
dissenting
and
of
the
working
classes
and
was
confident
the
government
would
be
much
influenced
by
them
the
newspapers
though
still
editorially
unfavourable
to
the
emancipation
proclamation
accepted
and
printed
communications
with
increasing
frequency
in
which
were
expressed
the
same
ideas
as
in
the
public
meetings
this
was
even
more
noticeable
in
the
provincial
press
samuel
goddard
a
merchant
of
birmingham
was
a
prolific
letter
writer
to
the
consistently
upholding
the
northern
cause
and
he
now
reiterated
the
phrase
lincoln
cause
is
just
and
holy
in
answer
to
southern
sneers
at
the
failure
of
the
proclamation
to
touch
slavery
in
the
border
states
goddard
made
clear
the
fact
that
lincoln
had
no
constitutional
right
to
apply
his
edict
to
states
not
in
rebellion
on
the
public
platform
no
one
equalled
the
old
orator
george
thompson
in
the
number
of
meetings
attended
and
addresses
made
in
less
than
a
month
he
had
spoken
times
and
often
in
places
where
opposition
was
in
evidence
everywhere
thompson
found
an
aroused
and
encouraged
feeling
now
strongly
for
the
north
eight
years
earlier
five
hundred
thousand
english
women
had
united
in
an
address
to
america
on
behalf
of
the
slaves
harriet
beecher
stowe
now
replied
to
this
and
asked
the
renewed
sympathy
of
her
english
sisters
a
largely
signed
round
robin
letter
assured
her
that
english
women
were
still
the
foes
of
slavery
and
were
indignantly
united
against
suggestions
of
british
recognition
of
the
south
working
class
britain
was
making
its
voice
heard
in
support
of
the
north
to
those
of
manchester
lincoln
on
january
addressed
a
special
letter
of
thanks
for
their
earnest
support
while
undergoing
personal
hardships
resulting
from
the
disruption
of
industry
caused
by
the
war
i
can
not
he
wrote
but
regard
your
decisive
utterances
upon
the
question
of
human
slavery
as
an
instance
of
sublime
christian
heroism
which
has
not
been
surpassed
in
any
age
or
in
any
country
nonconformist
england
now
came
vigorously
to
the
support
of
the
north
spurgeon
in
london
made
his
great
congregation
pray
with
him
god
bless
and
strengthen
the
north
give
victory
to
their
arms
further
and
more
general
expression
of
nonconformist
church
sympathy
came
as
a
result
of
a
letter
received
february
from
a
number
of
french
pastors
and
laymen
urging
all
the
evangelical
churches
to
unite
in
an
address
to
lincoln
the
london
and
manchester
emancipation
societies
combined
in
drawing
up
a
document
for
signature
by
pastors
and
this
was
presented
for
adoption
at
a
meeting
in
manchester
on
june
in
final
form
it
was
an
address
to
ministers
and
pastors
of
all
christian
denominations
throughout
the
states
of
america
there
was
a
noisy
opposition
but
the
address
was
carried
by
a
large
majority
and
two
representatives
massie
and
roylance
were
selected
to
bear
the
message
in
person
to
the
brethren
across
the
ocean
discussion
arose
over
the
biblical
sanction
of
slavery
in
the
appeared
an
editorial
pleading
this
sanction
and
arguing
the
of
slaves
to
refuse
liberty
goldwin
smith
regius
professor
of
modern
history
at
oxford
replied
in
a
pamphlet
does
the
bible
sanction
american
slavery
his
position
and
his
skill
in
presentation
made
him
a
valuable
ally
to
the
north
thus
british
circles
previously
on
the
defensive
became
aroused
and
enthusiastic
when
lincoln
january
proclamation
made
good
his
pledge
of
the
previous
september
other
elements
of
opinion
and
in
all
classes
were
strengthened
in
like
measure
and
everywhere
the
first
expression
of
fear
of
a
servile
insurrection
largely
disappeared
in
truth
england
went
to
such
lengths
in
its
support
of
emancipation
as
to
astound
and
alarm
the
which
called
these
demonstrations
a
carnival
of
cant
more
neutral
minds
were
perplexed
over
the
practical
difficulties
and
might
well
agree
with
schleiden
who
wrote
in
january
quoting
machiavelli
what
is
more
difficult
to
make
free
men
slaves
or
slaves
free
but
by
the
end
of
january
the
popular
approval
of
emancipation
was
in
full
swing
on
the
evening
of
the
there
took
place
in
london
at
exeter
hall
a
great
mass
meeting
unprecedented
in
attendance
and
enthusiasm
the
meeting
had
been
advertised
for
seven
but
long
before
the
hour
arrived
the
hall
was
jammed
and
the
corridors
filled
a
second
meeting
was
promptly
organized
for
the
lower
hall
but
even
so
the
people
seeking
admission
crowded
exeter
street
and
seriously
impeded
traffic
in
the
strand
outdoor
meetings
listened
to
reports
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
hall
and
cheered
the
speakers
the
main
address
was
made
by
the
rev
newman
hall
of
surrey
chapel
a
few
southern
sympathizers
who
attempted
to
heckle
the
speakers
were
quickly
shouted
down
the
carnival
of
cant
as
the
termed
it
was
truly
a
popular
demonstration
stirred
by
leaders
but
supported
by
the
working
and
classes
its
first
effect
was
to
restore
courage
and
confidence
to
northern
supporters
in
the
upper
classes
bright
had
welcomed
emancipation
yet
with
some
misgivings
he
now
joined
in
the
movement
and
in
a
speech
at
rochdale
february
on
slavery
and
secession
gave
full
approval
of
lincoln
efforts
in
shortly
after
the
appearance
of
spence
which
had
been
greeted
with
great
interest
in
england
and
had
influenced
largely
attitude
in
favour
of
the
south
cairnes
had
published
his
pamphlet
slave
power
this
was
a
reasoned
analysis
of
the
basis
of
slavery
and
a
direct
challenge
to
the
thesis
of
spence
england
unnatural
infatuation
for
a
slave
power
cairnes
prophesied
would
be
his
pamphlet
began
to
be
read
with
more
conviction
by
that
class
which
until
now
had
been
coldly
neutral
and
which
wished
a
more
reassured
faith
in
the
northern
cause
than
that
stirred
by
the
emotional
reception
given
the
emancipation
proclamation
yet
at
bottom
it
was
emancipation
that
brought
this
reasoning
public
to
seek
in
such
works
as
that
of
cairnes
a
logical
basis
for
a
change
of
heart
even
in
official
circles
utterances
previously
made
in
private
correspondence
or
in
governmental
conversations
only
were
now
ventured
in
public
by
friends
of
the
north
on
april
at
a
banquet
given
to
palmerston
in
edinburgh
the
duke
of
argyll
ventured
to
answer
a
reference
made
by
palmerston
in
a
speech
of
the
evening
previous
in
which
had
been
depicted
the
horrors
of
civil
war
by
asking
if
scotland
were
historically
in
a
position
to
object
to
civil
wars
having
high
moral
purpose
i
for
one
argyll
said
have
not
learned
to
be
ashamed
of
that
ancient
combination
of
the
bible
and
the
sword
let
it
be
enough
for
us
to
pray
and
hope
that
the
contest
whenever
it
may
be
brought
to
an
end
shall
bring
with
it
that
great
blessing
to
the
white
race
which
shall
consist
in
the
final
freedom
of
the
black
the
public
meetings
in
england
raised
high
the
hope
in
america
that
governmental
england
would
show
some
evidence
of
a
more
friendly
attitude
lincoln
himself
drafted
a
resolution
embodying
the
ideas
he
thought
it
would
be
wise
for
the
public
meetings
to
adopt
it
read
whereas
while
states
and
nations
have
tolerated
slavery
for
the
first
time
in
the
world
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
construct
a
new
nation
upon
the
basis
of
and
with
the
primary
and
fundamental
object
to
maintain
enlarge
and
perpetuate
human
slavery
therefore
that
no
such
embryo
state
should
ever
be
recognized
by
or
admitted
into
the
family
of
christian
and
civilized
nations
and
that
all
christian
and
civilized
men
everywhere
should
by
all
lawful
means
resist
to
the
utmost
such
recognition
or
admission
this
american
hope
much
disturbed
lyons
on
his
return
to
washington
in
november
he
had
regarded
the
emancipation
proclamation
as
a
political
manoeuvre
purely
and
an
unsuccessful
one
the
administration
he
thought
was
losing
ground
and
the
people
tired
of
the
war
this
was
the
burden
of
his
private
letters
to
russell
up
to
march
but
does
not
appear
in
his
official
despatches
in
which
there
was
nothing
to
give
offence
to
northern
statesmen
but
in
march
lyons
began
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
these
judgments
he
notes
a
renewed
northern
enthusiasm
leading
to
the
conferring
of
extreme
powers
the
dictatorship
measures
upon
lincoln
wise
as
lyons
ordinarily
was
he
was
bound
by
the
social
and
educational
traditions
of
his
class
and
had
at
first
not
the
slightest
conception
of
the
force
or
effect
of
emancipation
upon
the
public
in
england
he
feared
an
american
reaction
against
england
when
it
was
understood
that
popular
meetings
would
have
no
influence
on
the
british
government
seward
and
the
whole
party
calculate
immensely
on
the
effects
of
the
meetings
in
england
and
seem
to
fancy
that
public
feeling
in
england
is
coming
so
completely
round
to
the
north
that
the
government
will
be
obliged
to
favour
the
north
in
all
ways
even
if
it
be
disinclined
to
do
so
this
notion
is
unlucky
as
it
makes
those
who
hold
it
unreasonable
and
presumptuous
in
dealing
with
us
lincoln
plan
of
emancipation
and
his
first
proclamation
had
little
relation
to
american
foreign
policy
seward
attitude
toward
emancipation
was
that
the
of
it
and
of
a
possible
servile
war
might
be
useful
in
deterring
foreign
nations
especially
great
britain
from
intervening
but
he
objected
to
the
carrying
of
emancipation
into
effect
because
he
feared
it
would
intervention
servile
war
in
part
by
seward
own
efforts
in
part
because
of
earlier
british
newspaper
speculations
was
strongly
associated
with
emancipation
in
the
english
view
hence
the
government
received
the
september
proclamation
with
disfavour
the
press
with
contempt
and
the
public
with
apprehension
even
the
friends
of
the
north
but
no
servile
war
ensued
in
january
lincoln
kept
his
promise
of
wide
emancipation
and
the
north
stood
committed
to
a
high
moral
object
a
great
wave
of
relief
and
exultation
swept
over
england
but
did
not
so
quickly
extend
to
governmental
circles
it
was
largely
that
england
which
was
as
yet
without
direct
influence
on
parliament
which
so
exulted
and
now
upheld
the
north
could
this
england
of
the
people
affect
governmental
policy
and
influence
its
action
toward
america
lyons
correctly
interpreted
the
north
and
seward
as
now
more
inclined
to
press
the
british
government
on
points
previously
glossed
over
and
in
the
same
month
in
which
lyons
wrote
this
opinion
there
was
coming
to
a
head
a
controversy
over
britain
duty
as
a
neutral
which
both
during
the
war
and
afterwards
long
seemed
to
americans
a
serious
and
distinctly
unfriendly
breach
of
british
neutrality

the

the

it
must
first
be
understood
that
the
whole
question

a
belligerent
right
to
procure
ships
of
war
or
to
build
them
in
the
ports
of
neutral
nations
was
in
still
lacking
definite
application
in
international
law
there
were
general
principles
already
established
that
the
neutral
must
not
do
nor
permit
its
subjects
to
do
anything
directly
in
aid
of
belligerents
the
british
foreign
enlistment
act
notification
of
which
had
been
given
in
may
forbade
subjects
to
be
concerned
in
the
equipping
furnishing
fitting
out
or
arming
of
any
ship
or
vessel
with
intent
or
in
order
that
such
ship
or
vessel
shall
be
employed
in
the
service
of
a
belligerent
and
provided
for
punishment
of
individuals
and
forfeiture
of
vessels
if
this
prohibition
were
disobeyed
but
the
act
also
declared
that
such
punishment
or
seizure
would
follow
on
due
proof
of
the
offence
here
was
the
weak
point
of
the
act
for
in
effect
if
secrecy
were
maintained
by
offenders
the
proof
was
available
only
after
the
offence
had
been
committed
and
one
of
the
belligerents
injured
by
the
violation
of
the
law

of
had
realized
the
weakness
of
its
neutrality
laws
as
they
then
stood
and
by
a
new
law
of
march
hastily
passed
and
therefore
limited
to
two
years
duration
in
the
expectation
of
a
more
perfect
law
but
intended
as
a
clearer
exposition
of
neutral
duty
had
given
federal
officials
power
to
act
and
seize
leaving
the
proof
of
guilt
or
innocence
to
be
determined
later
but
the
british
interpretation
of
her
own
neutrality
laws
was
that
proof
was
required
in
advance
of
seizure
an
interpretation
wholly
in
line
with
the
basic
principle
that
a
man
was
innocent
until
proved
guilty
but
fatal
to
that
preservation
of
strict
neutrality
which
great
britain
had
so
promptly
asserted
at
the
beginning
of
the
civil
war
the
south
wholly
lacking
a
navy
or
the
means
to
create
one
early
conceived
the
idea
of
using
neutral
ports
for
the
construction
of
war
vessels
advice
secured
from
able
british
lawyers
was
to
the
effect
that
if
care
were
taken
to
observe
the
strict
letter
of
the
foreign
enlistment
act
by
avoiding
warlike
equipment
a
ship
even
though
her
construction
were
such
as
to
indicate
that
she
was
destined
to
become
a
ship
of
war
might
be
built
by
private
parties
in
british
yards
the
three
main
points
requiring
careful
observance
by
the
south
were
concealment
of
government
ownership
and
destination
no
war
equipment
and
no
enlistment
of
crew
in
british
waters
the
principal
agent
selected
by
the
south
to
operate
on
these
lines
was
captain
bullock
who
asserts
in
his
book
descriptive
of
his
work
that
he
never
violated
british
neutrality
law
and
that
prevailing
legal
opinion
in
england
supported
him
in
this
view
in
march
the
steamer
cleared
from
liverpool
with
a
declared
destination
of
palermo
the
mediterranean
and
jamaica
she
was
not
heard
of
until
three
months
later
when
she
was
reported
to
be
at
nassau
completing
her
equipment
as
a
southern
war
vessel
in
june
adams
notified
russell
that
a
new
and
still
more
powerful
was
nearly
ready
for
departure
from
the
port
of
liverpool
on
the
same
errand
he
protested
that
such
ships
violated
the
neutrality
of
great
britain
and
demanded
their
stoppage
and
seizure
from
june
to
july
when
this
second
ship
no
later
christened
the
left
liverpool
adams
and
the
united
states
consul
at
liverpool
dudley
were
busy
in
securing
evidence
and
in
renewing
protests
to
the
government
to
each
protest
russell
replied
in
but
a
few
lines
that
the
matter
had
been
referred
to
the
proper
departments
and
it
was
not
until
july
when
there
was
received
from
adams
an
opinion
by
an
eminent
queen
counsel
collier
that
the
affidavits
submitted
were
conclusive
against
the
that
russell
appears
to
have
been
seriously
concerned
on
july
the
law
officers
of
the
crown
were
asked
for
an
immediate
opinion
and
on
the
telegrams
were
sent
to
liverpool
and
to
other
ports
to
stop
and
further
examine
the
vessel
but
the
was
well
away
and
outside
of
british
waters
the
having
received
guns
and
munitions
by
a
ship
the
sent
out
from
england
to
that
end
and
having
enlisted
in
the
confederate
navy
most
of
the
british
crews
of
the
two
vessels
now
entered
upon
a
career
of
destruction
of
northern
commerce
she
was
not
a
privateer
as
she
was
commonly
called
at
the
time
but
a
government
vessel
of
war
specially
intended
to
capture
and
destroy
merchant
ships
in
short
her
true
character
in
terms
of
modern
naval
usage
was
that
of
a
commerce
destroyer
under
an
able
commander
captain
semmes
she
traversed
all
oceans
captured
merchant
ships
and
after
taking
coal
and
stores
from
them
sank
or
burnt
the
captures
for
two
years
she
evaded
battle
with
northern
war
vessels
and
spread
so
wide
a
fear
that
an
almost
wholesale
transfer
of
the
flag
from
american
to
british
or
other
foreign
register
took
place
in
the
mercantile
marine
the
career
of
the
was
followed
with
increasing
anger
and
chagrin
by
the
north
this
said
the
public
was
a
british
ship
manned
by
a
british
crew
using
british
guns
and
ammunition
whose
escape
from
liverpool
had
been
winked
at
by
the
british
government
what
further
evidence
was
necessary
of
bad
faith
in
a
professed
strict
neutrality
nor
were
american
officials
far
behind
the
public
in
suspicion
and
anger
at
the
last
moment
it
had
appeared
as
if
the
government
were
inclined
to
stop
the
was
the
hurried
departure
of
the
vessel
due
to
a
warning
received
from
official
sources
on
november
adams
reported
that
russell
complained
in
an
interview
of
remarks
made
privately
by
bright
to
the
effect
that
warning
had
come
from
russell
himself
and
seemed
to
me
a
little
as
if
he
suspected
that
mr
bright
had
heard
this
from
me
adams
disavowed
and
sincerely
any
such
imputation
but
at
the
same
time
expressed
to
russell
his
conviction
that
there
must
have
been
from
some
source
a
leak
of
the
intention
the
question
of
advance
warning
to
bullock
or
to
the
lairds
who
built
the
was
not
one
which
was
likely
to
be
officially
put
forward
in
any
case
the
real
issue
was
whether
an
offence
to
british
neutrality
law
had
been
committed
whether
it
would
be
acknowledged
as
such
and
still
more
important
whether
repetitions
of
the
offence
would
be
permitted
the
even
though
she
might
as
the
american
of
the
navy
wrote
be
giving
us
a
sick
turn
could
not
by
herself
greatly
affect
the
issue
of
the
war
but
many
would
be
a
serious
matter
the
belated
governmental
order
to
stop
the
vessel
was
no
assurance
for
the
future
since
in
reply
to
adams
protests
after
her
escape
and
to
a
prospective
claim
for
damages
russell
replied
that
in
fact
the
orders
to
stop
had
been
given
merely
for
the
purpose
of
further
investigation
and
that
in
strict
law
there
had
been
no
neglect
of
governmental
duty
if
this
were
so
similar
precautions
and
secrecy
would
prohibit
official
interference
in
the
issue
from
british
ports
of
a
whole
fleet
of
southern
russell
might
himself
feel
that
a
real
offence
to
the
north
had
taken
place
he
might
write
i
confess
the
proceedings
of
that
vessel
the
are
enough
to
a
more
temperate
nation
and
i
owe
a
grudge
to
the
liverpool
people
on
that
account
but
this
was
of
no
value
to
the
north
if
the
governmental
decision
was
against
interference
without
complete
and
absolute
proof
it
was
therefore
the
concern
of
the
north
to
find
some
means
of
bringing
home
to
the
british
ministry
the
enormity
of
the
offence
in
american
eyes
and
the
serious
danger
to
good
relations
if
such
offences
were
to
be
continued
an
immediate
downright
threat
of
war
would
have
been
impolitic
and
would
have
stirred
british
pride
to
the
point
of
resentment
yet
american
pride
was
aroused
also
and
it
was
required
of
seward
that
he
gain
the
northern
object
and
yet
make
no
such
threat
as
would
involve
the
two
nations
in
war
a
result
that
would
have
marked
the
success
of
southern
secession
that
seward
was
able
to
find
the
way
in
which
to
do
this
is
evidence
of
that
fertility
of
imagination
and
gift
in
expedient
which
marked
his
whole
career
in
the
diplomacy
of
the
civil
war
in
that
same
month
when
adams
was
beginning
his
protests
on
the
june
there
had
already
been
drawn
the
plans
and
the
contracts
made
with
the
laird
brothers
at
liverpool
for
the
building
of
two
vessels
far
more
dangerous
than
the
to
the
northern
cause
these
were
the
laird
rams
they
were
to
be
two
hundred
and
thirty
feet
long
have
a
beam
of
forty
feet
be
armoured
with
four
and
inch
iron
plate
and
be
provided
with
a
piercer
at
the
prow
about
seven
feet
long
and
of
great
strength
this
piercer
caused
the
ships
to
be
spoken
of
as
rams
and
when
the
vessels
were
fully
equipped
it
was
expected
the
piercer
would
be
three
feet
under
the
surface
of
the
water
this
was
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
two
ships
it
was
unusual
construction
nearly
impossible
of
use
in
an
ordinary
battle
at
sea
but
highly
dangerous
to
wooden
ships
maintaining
a
close
blockade
at
some
southern
port
while
there
was
much
newspaper
comment
in
england
that
the
vessels
were
new
and
in
america
that
they
were
floating
fortresses
suitable
for
attack
upon
defenceless
northern
cities
their
primary
purpose
was
to
break
up
the
blockading
squadrons
shortly
before
the
escape
of
the
and
at
a
time
when
there
was
but
little
hope
the
british
government
would
seize
her
and
shortly
after
the
news
was
received
in
washington
that
still
other
vessels
were
planned
for
building
in
the
lairds
yards
a
bill
was
introduced
in
congress
authorizing
the
president
to
issue
letters
of
marque
and
privateering
this
was
in
july
and
on
the
twelfth
seward
wrote
to
adams
of
the
proposed
measure
specifying
that
the
purpose
was
to
permit
privateers
to
seek
for
and
capture
or
destroy
the
or
other
vessels
of
a
like
type
he
characterized
this
as
a
plan
to
organize
the
militia
of
the
seas
by
issuing
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
neither
here
nor
at
any
time
did
seward
or
adams
allege
in
diplomatic
correspondence
any
other
purpose
than
the
pursuit
of
nor
is
it
presumable
that
in
july
the
construction
plans
of
the
rams
were
sufficiently
well
known
to
the
north
to
warrant
a
conclusion
that
the
later
purpose
of
the
proposed
privateering
fleet
was
quite
other
than
the
alleged
purpose
probably
the
bill
introduced
in
july
was
but
a
hasty
reaction
to
the
sailing
of
the
or
and
to
the
failure
of
early
protests
in
the
case
of
the
moreover
there
had
been
an
earlier
newspaper
agitation
for
an
increase
of
naval
power
by
the
creation
of
a
militia
of
the
seas
though
with
no
clear
conception
of
definite
objects
to
be
attained
this
agitation
was
now
renewed
and
reinforced
and
many
public
speeches
made
by
a
general
hiram
wallbridge
who
had
long
advocated
an
organization
of
the
mercantile
marine
as
an
asset
in
times
of
war
but
though
introduced
in
the
summer
of
the
privateering
bill
was
not
seriously
taken
up
until
february
in
the
senate
discussion
of
the
bill
at
the
time
of
introduction
senator
grimes
its
sponsor
declared
that
the
object
was
to
encourage
privateers
to
pursue
british
ships
when
as
was
expected
they
should
turn
confederate
sumner
objected
that
the
true
business
of
privateers
was
to
destroy
enemy
commerce
and
that
the
south
had
no
such
commerce
grimes
agreed
that
this
was
his
opinion
also
but
explained
that
the
administration
wanted
the
measure
passed
so
that
it
might
have
in
its
hands
a
power
to
be
used
if
the
need
arose
the
general
opinion
of
the
senate
was
opposed
and
the
matter
was
permitted
to
lapse
but
without
definite
action
so
that
it
could
at
any
time
be
called
up
again
six
months
later
the
progress
of
construction
and
the
purpose
of
the
rams
at
liverpool
were
common
knowledge
on
january
the
privateering
bill
again
came
before
the
senate
was
referred
to
the
committee
on
naval
affairs
reported
out
and
on
february
was
passed
and
sent
to
the
house
of
representatives
where
on
march
it
was
given
a
third
reading
and
passed
without
debate
in
the
senate
grimes
now
clearly
stated
that
the
bill
was
needed
because
the
confederates
are
now
building
in
england
a
fleet
of
vessels
designed
to
break
our
blockade
of
their
coast
and
that
the
privateers
were
to
assist
in
maintaining
blockades
there
was
no
thorough
debate
but
a
few
perfunctory
objections
were
raised
to
placing
so
great
a
power
in
the
hands
of
the
president
while
sumner
alone
appears
as
a
consistent
opponent
arguing
that
the
issue
of
privateers
would
be
dangerous
to
the
north
since
it
might
lead
to
an
unwarranted
interference
with
neutral
commerce
no
speaker
outlined
the
exact
method
by
which
privateers
were
to
be
used
in
maintaining
blockades
the
bill
was
passed
as
an
administration
measure
coincidently
but
as
yet
unknown
in
washington
the
chagrin
of
russell
at
the
escape
of
the
had
somewhat
lost
its
edge
at
first
he
had
been
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
amending
the
foreign
enlistment
act
so
as
to
prevent
similar
offences
and
had
gained
the
approval
of
the
law
officers
of
the
crown
russell
had
even
offered
to
take
up
with
america
an
agreement
by
which
both
countries
were
to
amend
their
neutrality
laws
at
the
same
moment
this
was
in
december
but
now
on
february
he
wrote
to
lyons
that
the
project
of
amendment
had
been
abandoned
as
the
cabinet
saw
no
way
of
improving
the
law
while
this
letter
to
lyons
was
on
its
way
to
america
a
letter
from
seward
was
explaining
to
adams
the
meaning
of
the
privateering
bill
the
senate
has
prepared
a
bill
which
confers
upon
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
power
to
grant
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
in
any
war
in
which
the
country
may
at
any
time
be
engaged
and
it
is
expected
that
the
bill
will
become
a
law
lord
lyons
suggests
that
the
transaction
may
possibly
be
misapprehended
abroad
if
it
come
upon
foreign
powers
suddenly
and
without
any
explanations
you
will
be
at
liberty
to
say
that
as
the
bill
stands
the
executive
government
will
be
set
at
liberty
to
put
the
law
in
force
in
its
discretion
and
that
thus
far
the
proper
policy
in
regard
to
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
has
not
engaged
the
president
attention
i
have
had
little
hesitation
in
saying
to
lord
lyons
that
if
no
extreme
circumstances
occur
there
will
be
entire
frankness
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
communicating
to
him
upon
the
subject
so
far
as
to
avoid
any
surprise
on
the
part
of
friendly
nations
whose
commerce
or
navigation
it
might
be
feared
would
be
incidentally
and
indirectly
affected
if
it
shall
be
found
expedient
to
put
the
act
in
force
against
the
insurgents
of
the
united
states
certainly
this
was
vague
explanation
yet
though
the
main
object
might
be
asserted
to
put
the
act
in
force
against
the
insurgents
the
hint
was
given
that
the
commerce
of
friendly
neutrals
might
be
incidentally
and
indirectly
affected
and
so
both
lyons
and
seward
understood
the
matter
for
on
february
lyons
reported
a
long
conversation
with
seward
in
which
after
pointing
out
the
probable
bad
effect
on
europe
lyons
received
the
reply
that
some
remedy
must
be
found
for
the
fact
that
the
law
did
not
appear
to
enable
the
british
government
to
prevent
the
issue
of
confederate
privateers
on
march
seward
followed
this
up
by
sending
to
lyons
an
autograph
letter
i
am
receiving
daily
such
representations
from
our
concerning
the
depredations
on
our
commerce
committed
by
the
vessels
built
and
practically
fitted
out
in
england
that
i
do
most
sincerely
apprehend
a
new
element
is
entering
into
the
unhappy
condition
of
affairs
which
with
all
the
best
dispositions
of
your
government
and
my
own
can
not
long
be
controlled
to
the
preservation
of
peace
if
you
think
well
of
it
i
should
like
that
you
should
confidentially
inform
earl
russell
that
the
departure
of
more
armed
vessels
under
command
from
english
ports
is
a
thing
to
be
deprecated
above
all
things
on
march
lyons
had
a
long
talk
with
seward
about
this
and
it
appears
that
lincoln
had
seen
the
letter
and
approved
it
seward
stated
that
the
new
york
chamber
of
commerce
had
protested
about
the
declaring
that
no
american
merchant
vessels
would
get
freights
that
even
war
with
england
was
preferable
to
this
that
in
that
case
the
maritime
enterprise
of
the
country
would
at
least
find
a
profitable
employment
in
cruising
against
british
trade
seward
went
on
to
show
the
necessity
of
letters
of
marque
and
lyons
protested
vigorously
and
implied
that
war
must
result
seward
said
that
he
was
well
aware
of
the
inconvenience
not
to
say
the
danger
of
issuing
letters
of
marque
that
he
should
be
glad
to
delay
doing
so
or
to
escape
the
necessity
altogether
but
that
really
unless
some
intelligence
came
from
england
to
allay
the
public
exasperation
the
measure
would
be
unavoidable
lyons
was
much
alarmed
writing
that
the
feeling
in
the
north
must
not
be
underestimated
and
pointing
out
that
the
newspapers
were
dwelling
on
the
notion
that
under
british
interpretation
of
her
duty
as
a
neutral
mexico
if
she
had
money
could
build
ships
in
british
ports
to
cruise
in
destruction
of
french
commerce
adding
that
one
might
almost
suppose
some
rich
american
would
give
the
funds
to
mexico
for
the
purpose
and
so
seek
to
involve
england
in
trouble
with
france
lyons
had
also
been
told
by
seward
in
their
conversation
of
march
that
on
that
day
an
instruction
had
been
sent
to
adams
to
present
to
russell
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
and
to
ask
for
some
assurance
that
no
further
southern
vessels
of
war
should
escape
from
british
ports
this
instruction
presented
the
situation
in
more
diplomatic
language
but
in
no
uncertain
tone
yet
still
confined
explanation
of
the
privateering
bill
as
required
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
our
national
navigating
interest
unless
that
calamity
can
be
prevented
by
the
enforcement
of
the
neutrality
law
of
great
britain
lyons
reports
reached
russell
before
seward
instruction
was
read
to
him
russell
had
already
commented
to
adams
that
american
privateers
would
find
no
confederate
merchant
ships
and
that
if
they
interfered
with
neutral
commerce
the
united
states
government
would
be
put
in
an
awkward
position
to
this
adams
replied
that
the
privateers
would
seek
and
capture
if
possible
vessels
like
the
but
russell
asked
lyons
to
find
out
whether
in
any
case
they
privateers
will
be
authorized
to
interfere
with
neutral
commerce
and
if
in
any
case
in
what
case
and
to
what
extent
three
days
later
on
march
adams
presented
his
instructions
and
these
russell
regarded
as
not
unfriendly
in
tone
but
in
the
long
conversation
that
ensued
the
old
result
was
reached
that
adams
declared
great
britain
negligent
in
performance
of
neutral
duty
while
russell
professed
eagerness
to
stop
southern
shipbuilding
if
full
evidence
was
forthcoming
adams
concluded
that
he
had
worked
to
the
best
of
his
power
for
peace
but
it
had
become
a
most
difficult
task
upon
this
russell
commented
to
lyons
adams
fully
deserves
the
character
of
having
always
laboured
for
peace
between
our
two
nations
nor
i
trust
will
his
efforts
and
those
of
the
two
governments
fail
of
success
in
these
last
days
of
march
matters
were
in
fact
rapidly
drawing
to
a
head
both
in
america
and
england
at
washington
from
march
seventh
to
the
the
question
of
issuing
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
had
been
prominently
before
the
cabinet
and
even
welles
who
had
opposed
them
was
affected
by
unfavourable
reports
received
from
adams
as
to
the
intentions
of
great
britain
the
final
decision
was
to
wait
later
news
from
england
this
was
seward
idea
as
he
had
not
as
yet
received
reports
of
the
british
reaction
to
his
communications
through
lyons
and
adams
march
was
the
critical
day
of
decision
in
london
as
it
was
also
the
day
upon
which
public
and
parliamentary
opinion
was
most
vigorously
debated
in
regard
to
great
britain
neutral
duty
preceding
this
other
factors
of
influence
were
coming
to
the
front
in
the
first
days
of
march
slidell
at
paris
had
received
assurances
that
if
the
south
wished
to
build
ships
in
french
yards
we
should
be
permitted
to
arm
and
equip
them
and
proceed
to
sea
this
suggestion
was
permitted
to
percolate
in
england
with
the
intention
no
doubt
of
strengthening
bullock
position
there
in
the
winter
of
orders
had
been
sent
to
the
russian
baltic
fleet
to
cruise
in
western
waters
and
there
was
first
a
suspicion
in
america
later
a
conviction
that
the
purpose
of
this
cruise
was
distinctly
friendly
to
the
north
that
the
orders
might
even
extend
to
actual
naval
aid
in
case
war
should
arise
with
england
and
france
in
march
this
was
but
vague
rumour
by
midsummer
it
was
a
confident
hope
by
when
russian
fleets
had
entered
the
harbours
of
new
york
and
san
francisco
the
rumour
had
become
a
conviction
and
the
silence
of
russian
naval
officers
when
banqueted
and
toasted
was
regarded
as
discreet
confirmation
there
was
no
truth
in
the
rumour
but
already
in
march
curious
surmises
were
being
made
even
in
england
as
to
russian
intentions
though
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
government
was
at
all
concerned
the
truth
was
that
the
russian
fleet
had
been
ordered
to
sea
as
a
precaution
against
easy
destruction
in
baltic
waters
in
case
the
difficulties
developing
in
relation
to
poland
should
lead
to
war
with
france
and
england
in
england
among
the
people
rather
than
in
governmental
england
a
feeling
was
beginning
to
manifest
itself
that
the
ministry
had
been
lax
in
regard
to
the
and
as
news
of
her
successes
was
received
this
feeling
was
given
voice
liverpool
at
first
almost
wholly
on
the
side
of
the
lairds
and
of
southern
became
doubtful
by
the
very
ease
with
which
the
destroyed
northern
ships
liverpool
merchants
looked
ahead
and
saw
that
their
interests
might
after
all
be
directly
opposed
to
those
of
the
meetings
were
held
and
the
matter
discussed
in
february
such
a
meeting
at
plaistow
attended
by
the
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
but
chiefly
by
working
men
especially
by
dock
labourers
and
by
men
from
the
yards
at
blackwall
resolved
that
the
chairman
be
requested
to
write
to
the
prime
minister
of
our
queen
earnestly
entreating
him
to
put
in
force
with
utmost
vigilance
the
law
of
england
against
such
ships
as
the
such
expressions
were
not
as
yet
widespread
nor
did
the
leading
papers
up
to
april
indulge
in
much
discussion
but
british
was
developing
unquestionably
russell
himself
was
experiencing
a
renewed
doubt
as
to
britain
neutral
duty
on
march
he
made
a
speech
in
parliament
which
adams
reported
as
the
most
satisfactory
of
all
the
speeches
he
has
made
since
i
have
been
at
this
post
on
march
came
the
presentation
by
adams
of
seward
instruction
of
which
russell
wrote
to
lyons
as
made
in
no
unfriendly
tone
and
as
a
result
of
which
adams
wrote
the
conclusion
which
i
draw
is
that
the
government
is
really
better
disposed
to
exertion
and
feels
itself
better
sustained
for
action
by
the
popular
sentiment
than
ever
before
russell
told
adams
that
he
had
received
a
note
from
palmerston
expressing
his
approbation
of
every
word
of
his
speech
three
days
before
in
a
portion
of
the
despatch
to
seward
not
printed
in
the
diplomatic
correspondence
adams
advised
against
the
issue
of
privateers
writing
in
the
present
favourable
state
of
popular
mind
it
scarcely
seems
advisable
to
run
the
risk
of
changing
the
current
in
great
britain
by
the
presentation
of
a
new
issue
which
might
rally
all
national
pride
against
us
as
was
done
in
the
case
that
russell
was
indeed
thinking
of
definite
action
is
foreshadowed
by
the
advice
he
gave
to
palmerston
on
march
as
to
the
latter
language
in
the
debate
scheduled
for
that
day
on
the
foreign
enlistment
act
russell
wrote
referring
to
the
interview
with
adams
the
only
thing
which
adams
could
think
of
when
i
asked
him
what
he
had
to
propose
in
reference
to
the
was
that
the
government
should
declare
their
disapproval
of
the
fitting
out
of
such
ships
of
war
to
prey
on
american
commerce
now
as
the
fitting
out
and
escape
of
the
and
was
clearly
an
evasion
of
our
law
i
think
you
can
have
no
difficulty
in
declaring
this
evening
that
the
government
disapprove
of
all
such
attempts
to
elude
our
law
with
a
view
to
assist
one
of
the
belligerents
but
the
tone
of
parliamentary
debate
did
not
bear
out
the
hopeful
view
of
the
american
minister
it
was
as
bright
wrote
to
sumner
badly
managed
and
told
against
us
and
bright
himself
participated
in
this
bad
management
for
over
a
year
he
had
been
advocating
the
cause
of
the
north
in
public
speeches
and
everywhere
pointing
out
to
unenfranchised
england
that
the
victory
of
the
north
was
essential
to
democracy
in
all
europe
always
an
orator
of
power
he
used
freely
vigorous
language
and
nowhere
more
so
than
in
a
great
public
meeting
of
the
trades
unions
of
london
in
james
hall
on
march
the
evening
before
the
parliamentary
debate
the
purpose
of
this
meeting
was
to
bring
public
pressure
on
the
government
in
favour
of
the
north
and
the
pith
of
bright
speech
was
to
contrast
the
democratic
instincts
of
working
men
with
the
aristocratic
inclinations
of
the
government
reviewing
aristocratic
attitude
toward
the
civil
war
bright

thinks
it
has
a
great
interest
in
this
contest
and
every
morning
with
blatant
voice
it
comes
into
your
streets
and
curses
the
american
republic
privilege
has
beheld
an
afflicting
spectacle
for
many
years
past
it
has
beheld
thirty
millions
of
men
happy
and
prosperous
without

without

without
the
surroundings
of
a
court
without
nobles
except
such
as
are
made
by
eminence
in

and

without

without

you
wish
the
freedom
of
your
country
you
wish
it
for
yourselves
do
not
then
give
the
hand
of
fellowship
to
the
worst
foes
of
freedom
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
you
will
not
do
this
i
have
faith
in
you
impartial
history
will
tell
that
when
your
statesmen
were
hostile
or
coldly
neutral
when
many
of
your
rich
men
were
corrupt
when
your
press
which
ought
to
have
instructed
and
defended
was
mainly
written
to
betray
the
fate
of
a
continent
and
of
its

in
peril
you
clung
to
freedom
with
an
unfailing
trust
that

in
his
infinite
mercy
will
yet
make
it
the
heritage
of
all
his
children
the
public
meeting
of
march
was
the
most
notable
one
in
support
of
the
north
held
throughout
the
whole
course
of
the
war
and
it
was
also
the
most
notable
one
as
indicating
the
rising
tide
of
popular
demand
for
more
democratic
institutions
that
it
irritated
the
government
and
gave
a
handle
to
southern
sympathizers
in
the
parliamentary
debate
of
march
is
unquestioned
in
addition
if
that
debate
was
intended
to
secure
from
the
government
an
intimation
of
future
policy
against
southern
shipbuilding
it
was
conducted
on
wrong
lines
for
effect
though
friends
of
the
north
may
have
thought
the
method
used
was
wise
for
effect
this
method
was
vigorous
attack
forster
leading
in
the
debate
called
on
ministers
to
explain
the
flagrant
violation
of
the
foreign
enlistment
act
and
to
offer
some
pledge
for
the
future
he
asserted
that
the
government
should
have
been
active
on
its
own
initiative
in
seeking
evidence
instead
of
waiting
to
be
urged
to
enforce
the
law
and
he
even
hinted
at
a
certain
degree
of
complicity
in
the
escape
of
the
the
answered
in
a
legal
defence
of
the
government
complained
of
the
offence
of
america
in
arousing
its
citizens
against
great
britain
upon
unjustifiable
grounds
but
did
not
make
so
vigorous
a
reply
as
might
perhaps
have
been
expected
still
he
stood
firmly
on
the
ground
that
the
government
could
not
act
without
evidence
to
convict
in
itself
a
statement
that
might
well
preclude
interference
with
the
rams
bright
accused
the
government
of
a
cold
and
unfriendly
neutrality
and
referred
at
length
to
the
public
meeting
of
the
previous
evening
if
you
had
last
night
looked
in
the
faces
of
three
thousand
of
the
most
intelligent
of
the
artisan
classes
in
london
as
i
did
and
heard
their
cheers
and
seen
their
sympathy
for
that
country
for
which
you
appear
to
care
so
little
you
would
imagine
that
the
more
forbearing
the
more
generous
and
the
more
just
the
conduct
of
the
government
to
the
united
states
the
more
it
would
recommend
itself
to
the
magnanimous
feelings
of
the
people
of
this
country
this
assumption
of
direct
opposition
between
parliament
and
the
people
was
not
likely
to
win
or
to
convince
men
whether
or
not
who
were
opponents
of
the
speaker
advocacy
of
more
democratic
institutions
in
england
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
laird
who
had
been
castigated
in
the
speeches
of
the
evening
rising
in
defence
of
the
conduct
of
his
firm
should
seek
applause
by
declaring
i
would
rather
be
handed
down
to
posterity
as
the
builder
of
a
dozen
than
as
a
man
who
applies
himself
deliberately
to
set
class
against
class
and
to
cry
up
the
institutions
of
another
country
which
when
they
come
to
be
tested
are
of
no
value
whatever
and
which
reduce
the
very
name
of
liberty
to
an
utter
absurdity
this
utterance
was
greeted
with
great
cheering
shouted
not
so
much
in
approval
of
the
as
in
approval
of
the
speaker
defiance
of
bright
illustration
william
edward
forster
in
short
the
friends
of
the
north
if
they
sought
some
immediate
pledge
by
the
government
had
gone
the
wrong
way
about
to
secure
it
vigour
in
attack
was
no
way
to
secure
a
favourable
response
from
palmerston
always
a
fighting
politician
in
public
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
now
fight
back
far
from
making
the
statement
recommended
to
him
by
russell
he
concluded
the
debate
by
reasserting
the
correctness
of
governmental
procedure
in
the
case
of
the
and
himself
with
vigour
accused
forster
and
bright
of
speaking
in
such
a
way
as
to
increase
rather
than
allay
american
irritation
yet
a
careful
reading
of
the
speeches
of
both
the
and
of
palmerston
shows
that
while
vindicating
the
government
conduct
in
the
past
they
were
avoiding
pledge
of
whatever
nature
for
the
future
adams
was
clearly
disappointed
and
thought
that
the
result
of
the
debate
was
rather
to
undo
in
the
popular
mind
the
effect
of
lord
speech
than
to
confirm
it
he
and
his
english
advisers
were
very
uneasy
not
knowing
whether
to
trust
to
russell
intimations
of
more
active
governmental
efforts
or
to
accept
the
conclusion
that
his
advice
had
been
rejected
by
palmerston
possibly
if
less
anxious
and
alarmed
they
would
have
read
more
clearly
between
the
lines
of
parliamentary
utterances
and
have
understood
that
their
failure
to
hurry
the
government
into
public
announcement
of
a
new
policy
was
no
proof
that
old
policy
would
be
continued
disappointed
at
the
result
in
parliament
they
forgot
that
the
real
pressure
on
government
was
coming
from
an
american
declaration
of
an
intention
to
issue
privateers
unless
something
were
done
to
satisfy
that
country
certainly
russell
was
unmoved
by
the
debate
for
on
april
he
wrote
to
palmerston
the
conduct
of
the
gentlemen
who
have
contracted
for
the
ironclads
at
birkenhead
is
so
very
suspicious
that
i
have
thought
it
necessary
to
direct
that
they
should
be
detained
the
has
been
consulted
and
concurs
in
the
measure
as
one
of
policy
though
not
of
strict
law
we
shall
thus
test
the
law
and
if
we
have
to
pay
damages
we
have
satisfied
the
opinion
which
prevails
here
as
well
as
in
america
that
this
kind
of
neutral
hostility
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
without
some
attempt
to
stop
it
two
days
later
on
april
the
a
vessel
being
equipped
to
join
the
as
a
commerce
destroyer
was
seized
on
the
ground
that
she
was
about
to
violate
the
enlistment
act
and
a
new
policy
at
least
to
make
a
test
case
in
law
was
thereby
made
public
in
fact
on
march
but
three
days
after
the
debate
of
march
the
case
of
the
had
been
taken
up
by
russell
referred
to
the
law
officers
on
march
and
approved
by
them
for
seizure
on
april
public
meetings
were
quickly
organized
in
support
of
the
government
action
as
that
in
manchester
on
april
when
six
thousand
people
applauded
the
seizure
of
the
demanded
vigorous
prosecution
of
the
lairds
and
others
and
urged
governmental
activity
to
prevent
any
further
for
the
south
on
april
russell
wrote
to
lyons
the
orders
given
to
watch
and
stop
when
evidence
can
be
procured
vessels
apparently
intended
for
the
confederate
service
will
it
is
to
be
hoped
allay
the
strong
feelings
which
have
been
raised
in
northern
america
by
the
escape
from
justice
of
the
and
it
thus
appears
that
orders
had
been
issued
to
stop
on
to
be
sure
but
on
evidence
of
the
vessels
being
intended
for
the
south
this
was
far
from
being
the
same
thing
as
the
previous
assertion
that
conclusive
evidence
was
required
what
then
was
the
basic
consideration
in
russell
mind
leading
to
such
a
on
declared
policy
chagrin
at
the
very
evident
failure
of
existing
neutrality
law
to
operate
recognition
that
there
was
just
cause
for
the
rising
of
the
north
no
doubt
influenced
him
but
more
powerful
than
these
elements
was
the
anxiety
as
to
the
real
purpose
and
intent
in
application
of
the
american
privateering
bill
how
did
russell
and
lyons
interpret
that
bill
and
what
complications
did
they
foresee
and
fear
as
previously
stated
in
this
chapter
the
privateering
bill
had
been
introduced
as
an
administration
measure
and
for
that
reason
passed
without
serious
debate
in
the
cabinet
it
was
opposed
by
welles
secretary
of
the
navy
until
he
was
overborne
by
the
feeling
that
something
must
be
done
because
vessels
were
building
in
england
intended
to
destroy
the
blockade
the
rams
under
construction
were
clearly
understood
to
have
that
purpose
if
privateers
were
to
offset
the
action
of
the
rams
there
must
be
some
definite
plan
for
their
use
seward
and
adams
repeatedly
complained
of
british
inaction
yet
in
the
same
breath
asserted
that
the
privateers
were
intended
to
chase
and
destroy
a
plan
so
foolish
so
it
seemed
to
british
diplomats
as
to
be
impossible
of
acceptance
as
the
full
purpose
of
seward
how
in
short
privateers
make
good
an
injury
to
blockade
about
to
be
done
by
the
rams
if
added
to
the
blockading
squadrons
on
station
off
the
southern
ports
they
would
but
become
so
much
more
fodder
for
the
dreaded
rams
if
sent
to
sea
in
pursuit
of
the
chances
were
that
they
would
be
the
vanquished
rather
than
the
victors
in
battle
there
was
no
southern
mercantile
marine
for
them
to
attack
and
privateering
against
enemy
commerce
was
thus
out
of
the
question
since
there
was
no
such
commerce
there
remained
but
one
reasonable
supposition
as
to
the
intended
use
of
privateers
if
the
rams
compelled
the
relaxation
of
the
close
blockade
the
only
recourse
of
the
north
would
be
to
establish
a
cruising
squadron
blockade
remote
from
the
shores
of
the
enemy
if
conducted
by
government
such
a
blockade
was
not
in
contravention
to
british
interpretation
of
international
law
but
the
northern
navy
conducting
a
cruising
squadron
blockade
was
far
too
small
to
interfere
seriously
with
neutral
vessels
bringing
supplies
to
the
confederacy
or
carrying
cotton
from
southern
ports
a
flood
of
privateers
scouring
the
ocean
from
pole
to
pole
might
conceivably
still
render
effective
that
closing
in
of
the
south
which
was
so
important
a
weapon
in
the
northern
war
programme
this
was
russell
interpretation
of
the
american
plan
and
he
saw
in
it
a
very
great
danger
to
british
commerce
and
an
inevitable
ultimate
clash
leading
to
war
such
no
doubt
it
was
seward
desire
should
be
russell
reaction
though
never
specifically
explaining
the
exact
purpose
of
the
privateers
moreover
of
the
actual
still
going
on
was
by
british
ships
and
this
being
so
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
privateers
searching
for
possible
blockade
runners
would
commit
all
sorts
of
indignities
and
interferences
with
british
merchant
ships
whether
on
a
trip
or
engaged
in
ordinary
trade
between
ports
immediately
on
learning
from
lyons
details
of
the
privateering
bill
russell
had
instructed
the
british
minister
at
washington
to
raise
objections
though
not
formally
making
official
protest
and
had
asked
for
explanation
of
the
exact
nature
of
the
proposed
activities
of
such
vessels
also
he
had
prepared
instructions
to
be
issued
by
the
admiralty
to
british
naval
commanders
as
to
their
duty
of
preventing
unwarranted
interference
with
legitimate
british
commerce
by
privateers
the
alteration
of
governmental
policy
as
indicated
in
the
arrest
of
the
it
might
be
hoped
would
at
least
cause
a
suspension
of
the
american
plan
but
assurances
were
strongly
desired
presumably
russell
knew
that
adams
as
a
result
of
their
conversations
had
recommended
such
suspension
but
at
washington
lyons
as
yet
uninformed
of
the
action
was
still
much
alarmed
on
april
he
reported
that
seward
had
read
to
him
a
despatch
to
adams
relative
to
the
ships
building
in
england
indicating
that
this
was
a
last
effort
to
avert
the
evils
which
the
present
state
of
things
had
made
imminent
lyons
had
argued
with
seward
the
inadvisability
of
sending
such
a
despatch
since
it
was
now
known
that
russell
had
spoken
in
a
satisfactory
manner
about
confederate
vessels
but
seward
was
insistent
lyons
believed
there
was
real
cause
for
anxiety
writing
a
good
deal
of
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
evident
design
of
the
government
and
indeed
of
the
people
to
intimidate
england
but
still
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
exasperation
has
reached
such
a
point
as
to
constitute
a
serious
danger
it
is
fully
shared
by
many
important
members
of
the
cabinet
nor
are
the
men
in
high
office
exempt
from
the
overweening
idea
of
the
naval
power
of
the
united
states
which
reconciles
the
people
to
the
notion
of
a
war
with
england
seward
for
a
certain
time
fanned
the
flame
in
order
to
recover
his
lost
popularity
he
is
now
i
believe
seriously
anxious
to
avoid
going
farther
but
if
strong
measures
against
england
were
taken
up
as
a
party
cry
by
the
republicans
seward
would
oppose
very
feeble
resistance
to
them
if
no
military
success
be
obtained
within
a
short
time
it
may
become
a
party
necessity
to
resort
to
some
means
of
producing
an
excitement
in
the
country
sufficient
to
enable
the
government
to
enforce
the
conscription
act
and
to
exercise
the
powers
conferred
by
the
late
congress
to
produce
such
an
excitement
the
more
ardent
of
the
party
would
not
hesitate
to
go
to
the
verge
of
a
war
with
england
nay
there
are
not
a
few
who
already
declare
that
if
the
south
must
be
lost
the
best
mode
to
conceal
the
discomfiture
of
the
party
and
of
the
nation
would
be
to
go
to
war
with
england
and
attribute
the
loss
of
the
south
to
english
interference
on
the
same
day
lyons
wrote
privately
i
would
rather
the
quarrel
came
if
come
it
must
upon
some
better
ground
for
us
than
this
question
of
the
ships
fitted
out
for
the
confederates
the
great
point
to
be
gained
in
my
opinion
would
be
to
prevent
the
ships
sailing
without
leading
the
people
here
to
think
that
they
had
gained
their
point
by
threats
so
great
was
lyons
alarm
that
the
next
day
april
he
monck
in
canada
that
trouble
was
brewing
but
soon
his
fears
were
somewhat
allayed
on
the
seventeenth
he
could
report
that
seward
strong
despatch
to
adams
was
not
intended
for
communication
to
russell
and
on
the
when
presenting
under
instructions
russell
protest
against
the
privateering
plan
he
was
pleased
if
not
surprised
to
find
that
the
latest
advices
from
england
and
the
news
of
the
seizure
of
the
had
caused
seward
to
become
very
conciliatory
lyons
was
assured
that
the
plan
was
for
the
present
at
rest
apparently
seward
now
felt
more
security
than
did
lyons
as
to
future
british
action
for
three
days
later
the
british
minister
wrote
to
milne
that
an
american
issue
of
letters
of
marque
would
surely
come
if
england
did
not
stop
southern
and
he
wrote
in
such
a
way
as
to
indicate
his
own
opinion
that
effective
steps
be
taken
to
prevent
their
escape
the
whole
tone
and
matter
of
lyons
despatches
to
russell
show
that
he
regarded
the
crisis
of
relations
in
regard
to
southern
in
british
yards
as
occurring
in
seward
became
unusually
friendly
even
embarrassingly
so
for
in
august
he
virtually
forced
lyons
to
go
on
tour
with
him
through
the
state
of
new
york
thus
making
public
demonstration
of
the
good
relations
of
the
two
governments
this
sweet
harmony
and
mutual
confidence
is
wholly
contrary
to
the
usual
historical
treatment
of
the
laird
rams
incident
which
neglects
the
threat
of
the
privateering
bill
regards
american
protests
as
steadily
increasing
in
vigour
and
concludes
with
the
threat
of
war
note
by
adams
to
russell
just
previous
to
the
seizure
of
the
rams
in
september
previously
however
american
historians
have
been
able
to
use
only
american
sources
and
have
been
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
privateering
plan
since
seward
never
went
beyond
a
vague
generalization
of
its
object
in
official
utterances
it
is
the
british
reaction
to
that
plan
which
reveals
the
real
threat
made
and
the
actual
crisis
of
the
incident
it
follows
therefore
that
the
later
story
of
the
rams
requires
less
extended
treatment
than
is
customarily
given
to
it
the
correct
understanding
of
this
later
story
is
the
recognition
that
great
britain
had
in
april
given
a
pledge
and
performed
an
act
which
satisfied
seward
and
adams
that
the
rams
would
not
be
permitted
to
escape
it
was
their
duty
nevertheless
to
be
on
guard
against
a
british
relaxation
of
the
promise
made
and
the
delay
up
to
the
very
last
moment
in
seizing
the
rams
caused
american
anxiety
and
ultimately
created
a
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
british
actions
public
opinion
in
england
was
steadily
increasing
against
southern
on
june
a
memorial
was
sent
to
the
foreign
office
by
a
group
of
in
liverpool
suggesting
an
alteration
in
the
foreign
enlistment
act
if
this
were
needed
to
prevent
the
issue
of
southern
ships
and
pointing
out
that
the
present
policy
of
the
government
would
entail
a
serious
danger
to
british
commerce
in
the
future
if
when
england
herself
became
a
belligerent
neutral
ports
could
be
used
by
the
enemy
to
build
commerce
destroyers
the
memorial
concluded
that
in
any
case
it
was
a
disgrace
that
british
law
should
be
so
publicly
infringed
to
this
hammond
gave
the
old
answer
that
the
law
was
adequate
provided
proof
can
be
obtained
of
any
act
done
with
the
intent
to
violate
it
evidently
as
distinguished
from
were
now
acutely
alarmed
meanwhile
attention
was
fixed
on
the
trial
of
the
and
on
june
a
decision
was
rendered
against
the
government
but
was
promptly
appealed
this
decision
made
both
northern
and
southern
agents
anxious
and
the
latter
took
steps
further
to
becloud
the
status
of
the
rams
rumours
were
spread
that
the
vessels
were
in
fact
intended
for
france
and
when
this
was
disproved
that
they
were
being
built
for
the
viceroy
of
egypt
this
also
proved
to
be
untrue
finally
it
was
declared
that
the
real
owners
were
certain
french
merchants
whose
purpose
in
contracting
for
such
clearly
warlike
vessels
was
left
in
mystery
but
with
the
intimation
that
egypt
was
to
be
the
ultimate
purchaser
captain
bullock
had
indeed
made
such
a
contract
of
sale
to
french
merchants
but
with
the
proviso
of
resale
to
him
after
delivery
on
his
part
russell
was
seeking
fully
adequate
to
seizure
but
this
was
difficult
to
obtain
and
such
as
was
submitted
was
regarded
by
the
law
officers
as
inadequate
they
reported
that
there
was
no
evidence
capable
of
being
presented
to
a
court
of
justice
he
informed
adams
of
this
legal
opinion
at
the
moment
when
the
latter
knowing
the
rams
to
be
nearing
completion
and
fearing
that
russell
was
weakening
in
his
earlier
determination
began
that
series
of
diplomatic
protests
which
very
nearly
approached
a
threat
of
war
at
washington
also
anxiety
was
again
aroused
by
the
court
decision
in
the
case
and
shortly
after
the
great
northern
victories
at
vicksburg
and
gettysburg
seward
wrote
a
despatch
to
adams
july
which
has
been
interpreted
as
a
definite
threat
of
war
in
substance
seward
wrote
that
he
still
felt
confident
the
government
of
great
britain
would
find
a
way
to
nullify
the
decision
but
renewed
in
case
this
did
not
prove
true
his
assertion
of
northern
intention
to
issue
letters
of
marque
adding
a
phrase
about
the
right
to
pursue
southern
vessels
even
into
neutral
ports
but
there
are
two
considerations
in
respect
to
this
despatch
that
largely
negative
the
belligerent
intent
attributed
to
it
seward
did
not
read
or
communicate
it
to
lyons
as
was
his
wont
when
anything
serious
was
in
mind
and
he
did
not
instruct
adams
to
communicate
it
to
russell
the
latter
never
heard
of
it
until
the
publication
in
of
the
united
states
diplomatic
correspondence
in
london
on
july
adams
began
to
present
to
russell
evidence
secured
by
consul
dudley
at
liverpool
relative
to
the
rams
and
to
urge
their
immediate
seizure
adams
here
but
performed
his
duty
and
was
in
fact
acting
in
accordance
with
russell
own
request
on
july
he
reported
to
seward
that
the
roebuck
motion
for
recognition
of
the
south
had
died
ingloriously
but
expressed
a
renewal
of
anxiety
because
of
the
slowness
of
the
government
if
the
rams
were
to
escape
adams
wrote
to
russell
on
july
britain
would
herself
become
a
participant
in
the
war
further
affidavits
were
sent
to
russell
on
august
and
on
september
having
heard
from
russell
that
the
government
was
legally
advised
they
can
not
interfere
in
any
way
with
these
vessels
adams
sent
still
more
affidavits
and
expressed
his
regret
that
his
previous
notes
had
not
sufficiently
emphasized
the
grave
nature
of
the
crisis
pending
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
to
this
russell
replied
that
the
matter
was
under
serious
and
anxious
consideration
to
which
on
september
in
a
long
communication
adams
wrote
that
if
the
rams
escaped
it
would
be
superfluous
in
me
to
point
out
to
your
lordship
that
this
is
war
the
phrase
was
carefully
chosen
to
permit
a
denial
of
a
threat
of
war
on
the
explanation
that
great
britain
would
herself
be
participating
in
the
war
there
is
no
question
that
at
the
moment
adams
thought
change
of
policy
of
april
was
now
thrown
overboard
but
the
fact
was
that
on
september
russell
had
already
given
directions
to
take
steps
for
the
detention
of
the
rams
and
that
on
september
positive
instructions
were
given
to
that
effect
though
not
carried
out
until
some
days
later
there
had
been
no
alteration
in
the
new
policy
of
april
the
whole
point
of
the
delay
was
governmental
anxiety
to
secure
evidence
sufficient
to
convict
and
thus
to
avoid
attack
for
acting
in
contradiction
to
those
principles
which
had
been
declared
to
be
the
compelling
principles
of
in
the
case
of
the
but
so
perfect
were
the
arrangements
of
captain
bullock
that
complete
evidence
was
not
procurable
and
russell
was
forced
finally
to
act
without
it
it
would
appear
from
a
letter
written
by
russell
to
palmerston
on
september
the
day
on
which
he
gave
the
order
to
stop
that
no
cabinet
approval
for
this
step
had
yet
formally
been
given
since
russell
notified
palmerston
of
his
purpose
and
asked
the
latter
if
he
disapproved
to
call
a
cabinet
at
once
the
to
stop
the
rams
must
have
long
been
understood
for
palmerston
called
no
cabinet
moreover
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
he
was
preparing
the
public
for
the
seizure
for
on
this
same
september
the
in
a
long
editorial
argued
that
the
law
as
it
stood
or
was
interpreted
was
not
in
harmony
with
true
neutrality
and
pointed
out
future
dangers
to
british
commerce
as
had
the
liverpool
delane
of
the
was
at
this
period
especially
close
to
palmerston
and
it
is
at
least
inferential
that
the
editorial
was
an
advance
notice
of
governmental
intention
to
apply
a
policy
known
in
intimate
circles
to
have
been
for
some
time
matured
four
days
later
while
governmental
action
was
still
unknown
to
the
public
another
editorial
advocated
seizure
of
the
rams
russell
had
acted
under
the
fear
that
one
of
the
rams
might
slip
away
as
had
the
he
had
sent
orders
to
stop
and
investigate
but
he
delayed
final
seizure
in
the
hope
that
better
evidence
might
yet
be
secured
conducting
a
rapid
exchange
of
letters
with
lairds
the
builders
seeking
to
get
admissions
from
them
it
was
only
on
september
that
lairds
was
officially
ordered
not
to
send
the
vessels
on
a
trial
trip
and
it
was
not
until
september
that
public
announcement
was
made
of
the
government
action
russell
has
been
regarded
as
careless
and
thoughtless
in
that
it
was
not
until
september
he
relieved
adams
mind
by
assuring
him
the
rams
would
be
seized
even
though
three
days
before
on
september
this
information
had
been
sent
to
washington
the
explanation
is
eager
search
for
evidence
to
and
his
correspondence
with
lairds
which
did
not
come
to
a
head
until
the
eighth
when
the
builders
refused
to
give
information
to
the
builders
russell
was
writing
as
if
a
governmental
decision
had
not
yet
been
reached
he
could
take
no
chance
of
a
leak
through
the
american
minister
once
informed
adams
was
well
satisfied
though
his
immediate
reaction
was
to
criticize
not
russell
but
the
general
timidity
and
vacillation
of
the
law
officers
of
the
crown
two
days
later
having
learned
from
russell
himself
just
what
was
taking
place
adams
described
the
firm
stand
taken
by
the
foreign
secretary
noted
the
general
approval
by
the
public
press
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
there
was
now
a
better
prospect
of
being
able
to
preserve
friendly
relations
with
england
than
at
any
time
since
his
arrival
in
london
across
the
water
british
officials
were
delighted
with
the
seizure
of
the
rams
monck
in
canada
expressed
his
approval
lyons
reported
a
great
improvement
in
the
feeling
toward
england
and
that
seward
especially
was
highly
pleased
with
russell
expressions
conveyed
privately
of
esteem
for
seward
together
with
the
hope
that
he
would
remain
in
office
the
actual
governmental
seizure
of
the
rams
did
not
occur
until
though
they
had
been
placed
under
official
surveillance
on
september
both
sides
were
jockeying
for
position
in
the
expected
legal
battle
when
the
case
should
be
taken
up
by
the
courts
at
first
russell
even
thought
of
making
official
protest
to
mason
in
london
and
a
draft
of
such
protest
was
prepared
approved
by
the
law
officers
and
subsequently
revised
by
palmerston
but
finally
was
not
sent
possibly
it
was
thought
that
such
a
communication
to
mason
approached
too
nearly
a
recognition
of
him
in
his
desired
official
capacity
for
in
december
the
protest
ultimately
directed
to
be
made
through
crawford
at
havana
instructed
him
to
go
to
richmond
and
after
stating
very
plainly
that
he
was
in
no
way
recognizing
the
confederacy
to
present
the
following
it
appears
from
various
correspondence
the
authenticity
of
which
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
confederate
government
having
no
good
ports
free
from
the
blockade
of
the
federals
have
conceived
the
design
of
using
the
ports
of
the
united
kingdom
for
the
purpose
of
constructing
ships
of
war
to
be
equipped
and
armed
to
serve
as
cruisers
against
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
of
america
a
state
with
which
her
majesty
is
at
peace
these
acts
are
inconsistent
with
the
respect
and
comity
which
ought
to
be
shewn
by
a
belligerent
towards
a
neutral
power
her
majesty
has
declared
her
neutrality
and
means
strictly
to
observe
it
you
will
therefore
call
upon
benjamin
to
induce
his
government
to
forbear
from
all
acts
tending
to
affect
injuriously
her
majesty
position
to
carry
out
this
instruction
there
was
required
permission
for
crawford
to
pass
through
the
blockade
but
seward
refused
this
when
lyons
made
the
request
not
everyone
in
britain
however
approved
the
government
course
in
seizing
the
rams
legal
opinion
especially
was
very
generally
against
the
act
adams
now
pressed
either
for
an
alteration
of
the
british
law
or
for
a
convention
with
america
establishing
mutual
similar
interpretation
of
neutral
duty
russell
replied
that
until
the
trials
of
the
and
the
steam
rams
had
taken
place
we
could
hardly
be
said
to
know
what
our
law
was
and
therefore
not
tell
whether
it
required
alteration
i
said
however
that
he
might
assure
seward
that
the
wish
and
intention
of
government
were
to
make
our
neutrality
an
honest
and
one
but
save
from
extreme
and
avowed
southern
sympathizers
criticism
of
the
government
was
directed
less
to
the
stoppage
of
the
rams
than
to
attacks
of
a
political
character
attempting
to
depict
the
weakness
of
the
foreign
minister
and
his
humiliation
of
great
britain
in
having
yielded
to
american
threats
thus
february
ii
after
the
reassembling
of
parliament
a
party
attack
was
made
on
russell
and
the
government
by
derby
in
the
house
of
lords
derby
approved
the
stopping
of
the
rams
but
sought
to
prove
that
the
government
had
dishonoured
england
by
failing
to
act
of
its
own
volition
until
threatened
by
america
he
cited
seward
despatch
of
july
ii
with
much
unction
that
despatch
now
having
appeared
in
the
printed
american
diplomatic
correspondence
with
no
indication
that
it
was
not
an
instruction
at
once
communicated
to
russell
the
attack
fell
flat
for
russell
simply
replied
that
adams
had
never
presented
such
an
instruction
this
forced
derby
to
seek
other
ground
and
on
february
he
returned
to
the
matter
now
seeking
to
show
by
the
dates
of
various
documents
that
at
the
last
moment
adams
made
a
threat
of
war
and
russell
had
yielded
again
russell
reply
was
brief
and
to
the
effect
that
orders
to
stop
the
rams
had
been
given
before
the
communications
from
adams
were
received
finally
on
february
a
motion
in
the
commons
called
for
all
correspondence
with
adams
and
with
lairds
the
government
consented
to
the
first
but
refused
that
with
lairds
and
was
supported
by
a
vote
of
to
beginning
with
an
incautious
personal
and
petty
criticism
of
russell
the
tories
had
been
driven
to
an
attempt
to
pass
what
was
virtually
a
vote
of
censure
on
the
ministry
yet
they
were
as
loud
as
was
the
government
in
praise
of
adams
and
in
approval
of
the
seizure
of
the
rams
naturally
their
cause
was
weakened
and
the
ministry
referring
to
expressions
made
and
intentions
indicated
as
far
back
as
march
thus
hinting
without
directly
so
stating
that
the
real
decision
had
then
been
made
was
easily
the
victor
in
the
vote
derby
had
committed
an
error
as
a
party
leader
and
the
fault
rankled
for
again
in
april
he
attempted
to
draw
russell
into
still
further
discussion
on
dates
of
documents
russell
reply
ignored
that
point
altogether
it
did
not
suit
his
purpose
to
declare
flatly
the
fact
that
in
april
assurances
had
been
given
both
to
adams
and
through
lyons
to
seward
that
measures
would
be
taken
to
prevent
the
departure
of
southern
vessels
from
british
ports
to
have
made
this
disclosure
would
have
required
an
explanation
such
assurance
had
been
given
and
this
would
have
revealed
the
effect
on
both
russell
and
lyons
of
the
northern
plan
to
create
a
squadron
blockade
by
was
the
real
threat
the
later
delays
and
seeming
uncertainties
of
british
action
made
adams
anxious
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
russell
ever
changed
his
purpose
he
sought
stronger
evidence
before
acting
and
he
hoped
for
stronger
support
from
legal
advisers
but
he
kept
an
eye
on
the
rams
and
when
they
had
reached
the
stage
where
there
was
danger
of
escape
he
seized
them
even
though
the
desired
evidence
was
still
lacking
seward
privateering
bill
plan
possibly
entered
upon
in
a
moment
of
desperation
and
with
no
clear
statement
from
him
of
its
exact
application
had
as
the
anxiety
of
british
diplomats
became
pronounced
been
used
with
skill
to
permit
if
not
to
state
the
interpretation
they
placed
upon
it
and
the
result
had
been
the
cessation
of
that
inadequate
neutrality
of
which
america
complained

the
first
trial
though
appealed
had
gone
against
the
government

june
and
there
was
no
knowledge
that
the
ministry
was
determined
in
its
stand
from
january
to
the
end
of
march
the
public
demonstrations
in
approval
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
had
somewhat
checked
expressions
of
southern
sympathy
but
by
the
month
of
june
old
friends
had
recovered
their
courage
and
a
new
champion
of
the
south
came
forward
in
the
person
of
roebuck
meanwhile
the
activities
of
southern
agents
and
southern
friends
had
not
ceased
even
if
they
had
for
a
time
adopted
a
less
vigorous
tone
for
four
months
after
the
british
refusal
of
napoleon
overtures
on
mediation
in
november
the
friends
of
the
south
were
against
acting
now
but
this
did
not
imply
that
they
thought
the
cause
lost
or
in
any
sense
hopeless
publicists
either
neutral
in
attitude
or
even
professedly
sympathetic
with
the
north
could
see
no
outcome
of
the
civil
war
save
separation
of
north
and
south
thus
the
historian
freeman
in
the
preface
to
the
first
volume
of
his
uncompleted
of
federal
published
in
carefully
explained
that
his
book
did
not
have
its
origin
in
the
struggle
in
america
and
argued
that
the
breaking
up
of
the
union
in
no
way
proved
any
inherent
weakness
in
a
federal
system
but
took
it
for
granted
that
american
reunion
was
impossible
the
novelist
anthony
trollope
after
a
long
tour
of
the
north
beginning
in

published
late
in
a
work
descriptive
of
a
nation
engaged
in
the
business
of
war
and
wholly
sympathetic
with
the
northern
cause
yet
he
also
could
see
no
hope
of
forcing
the
south
back
into
the

the
north
and
south
are
virtually
separated
and
the
day
will
come
in
which
the
west
also
will
secede
such
interpretations
of
conditions
in
america
were
not
unusual
they
were
rather
generally
accepted
the
cabinet
decision
in
november
was
not
regarded
as
final
though
events
were
to
prove
it
to
be
so
for
never
again
was
there
so
near
an
approach
to
british
intervention
mason
friend
spence
early
began
to
think
that
true
southern
policy
was
now
to
make
an
appeal
to
the
tories
against
the
government
in
january
he
was
planning
a
new
move
i
have
written
to
urge
gregory
to
be
here
in
time
for
a
thorough
organization
so
as
to
push
the
matter
this
time
to
a
vote
i
think
the
conservatives
may
be
got
to
move
as
a
body
and
if
so
the
result
of
a
vote
seems
to
me
very
certain
i
have
seen
horsfall
and
laird
here
and
will
put
myself
in
communication
with
disraeli
as
the
time
approaches
for
action
for
this
seems
to
me
now
our
best
card
that
some
such
effort
was
being
thought
of
is
evidenced
by
the
attitude
of
the
which
all
through
the
months
from
november
to
the
middle
of
january
had
continued
to
harp
on
the
subject
of
mediation
as
if
still
believing
that
something
yet
might
be
done
by
the
existing
ministry
but
which
then
apparently
gave
up
hope
of
the
palmerstonian
administration
but
what
the
government
means
is
evident
enough
it
does
not
mean
to
intervene
or
to
interfere
it
will
not
mediate
if
it
can
help
it
it
will
not
recognize
the
confederate
states
unless
there
should
occur
some
of
those
over
which
they
have
no
control
which
leave
weak
men
and
weak
ministers
no
choice
they
will
not
if
they
are
not
forced
to
it
quarrel
with
seward
or
with
mr
bright
they
will
let
lancashire
starve
they
will
let
british
merchantmen
be
plundered
off
nassau
and
burnt
off
cuba
they
will
submit
to
a
blockade
of
bermuda
or
of
liverpool
but
they
will
do
nothing
which
may
tend
to
bring
a
supply
of
cotton
from
the
south
or
to
cut
off
the
supply
of
eggs
and
bacon
from
the
north
but
this
plan
of
to
the
tories
received
scant
encouragement
and
was
of
no
immediate
promise
as
soon
appeared
by
the
debate

laid

gregory
writing
in
response
to
an
inquiry
from
mason
the
house
of
commons
is
opposed
to
taking
any
step
at
present
feeling
rightly
or
wrongly
that
to
do
so
would
be
useless
to
the
south
and
possibly
embroil
us
with
the
north
any
motion
on
the
subject
will
be
received
with
disfavour
consequently
the
way
in
which
it
will
be
treated
will
only
make
the
north
more
elated
and
will
irritate
the
south
against
us
if
i
saw
the
slightest
chance
of
a
motion
being
received
with
any
favour
i
would
not
let
it
go
into
other
hands
but
i
find
the
most
influential
men
of
all
parties
opposed
to
it
of
like
opinion
was
slidell
who
writing
of
the
situation
in
france
reported
that
he
had
been
informed
by
his
friend
at
the
foreign
office
that
it
is
believed
that
every
possible
thing
has
been
done
here
in
your
behalf
we
must
now
await
the
action
of
england
and
it
is
through
that
you
must
aim
all
your
efforts
in
that
direction
with
the
failure
at
least
temporary
of
southern
efforts
to
move
the
british
government
or
to
stir
parliament
energies
were
now
directed
toward
using
financial
methods
of
winning
support
for
the
southern
cause
the
confederate
cotton
loan
was
undertaken
with
the
double
object
of
providing
funds
for
southern
agents
in
europe
and
of
creating
an
interested
support
of
the
south
which
might
it
was
hoped
ultimately
influence
the
british
government
by
it
had
become
exceedingly
difficult
owing
to
the
blockade
for
the
government
at
richmond
to
transmit
funds
to
its
agents
abroad
bullock
especially
required
large
amounts
in
furtherance
of
his
contracts
and
was
embarrassed
by
the
lack
of
business
methods
and
the
delays
of
the
government
at
home
the
incompetence
of
the
confederacy
in
finance
was
a
weakness
that
characterized
all
of
its
many
operations
whether
at
home
or
abroad
and
was
made
evident
in
england
by
the
confusion
in
its
efforts
to
establish
credits
there
at
first
the
confederate
government
supplied
its
agents
abroad
with
drafts
upon
the
house
of
fraser
trenholm
company
of
liverpool
a
branch
of
the
firm
long
established
at
charleston
south
carolina
purchasing
its
bills
of
exchange
with
its
own
home
made
money
but
as
confederate
currency
rapidly
depreciated
this
method
of
transmitting
funds
became
increasingly
difficult
and
costly
the
next
step
was
to
send
to
spence
nominated
by
mason
as
financial
adviser
in
england
confederate
money
bonds
for
sale
on
the
british
market
with
authority
to
dispose
of
them
as
low
as
fifty
cents
on
the
dollar
but
these
found
no
takers
by
september
bullock
funds
for
were
exhausted
and
some
new
method
of
supply
was
required
temporary
relief
was
found
in
adopting
a
suggestion
from
lindsay
whereby
cotton
was
made
the
basis
for
an
advance
of
a
form
of
cotton
bond
being
devised
which
fixed
the
price
of
cotton
at
eightpence
the
pound
these
bonds
were
not
put
on
the
market
but
were
privately
placed
by
lindsay
company
with
a
few
buyers
for
the
entire
sum
the
transaction
remaining
secret
in
the
meantime
this
same
recourse
to
cotton
had
occurred
to
the
authorities
at
richmond
and
a
plan
formulated
by
which
cotton
should
be
purchased
by
the
government
stored
and
certificates
issued
to
be
sold
abroad
the
purchaser
being
assured
of
all
facilities
of
shipment
spence
was
to
be
the
authorized
agent
for
the
sale
of
these
cotton
certificates
but
before
any
reached
him
various
special
agents
of
the
confederacy
had
arrived
in
england
by
december
with
such
certificates
in
their
possession
and
had
disposed
of
some
of
them
calling
them
cotton
warrants
the
difficulties
which
might
arise
from
separate
action
in
the
market
were
at
once
perceived
and
following
a
conference
with
mason
all
cotton
obligations
were
turned
to
fraser
trenholm
company
spence
now
had
in
his
hands
the
money
bonds
but
no
further
attempt
was
made
to
dispose
of
these
since
the
cotton
warrants
were
considered
a
better
means
of
raising
funds
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
since
all
of
these
efforts
involved
a
governmental
guarantee
the
various
certificates
or
warrants
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
government
bond
yet
up
to
this
point
the
richmond
authorities
after
the
first
failure
to
sell
money
bonds
abroad
were
not
keen
to
attempt
anything
that
could
be
stamped
as
a
foreign
government
loan
their
idea
was
rather
that
a
certain
part
of
the
produce
of
the
south
was
being
set
aside
as
the
property
of
those
who
in
england
should
extend
credit
to
the
south
the
sole
purpose
of
these
earlier
operations
was
to
provide
funds
for
southern
agents
by
july
bullock
had
exhausted
his
earlier
credit
of
a
million
dollars
the
loan
secured
through
lindsay
then
tided
over
an
emergency
demand
and
this
had
been
followed
by
a
development
on
similar
lines
of
the
cotton
certificates
and
warrants
which
by
december
had
secured
through
spence
agency
an
additional
million
dollars
or
thereabouts
mason
was
strongly
recommending
further
expansion
of
this
method
and
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
spence
now
however
there
was
broached
to
the
authorities
in
richmond
a
proposal
for
the
definite
floating
in
europe
of
a
specified
cotton
loan
this
proposal
came
through
slidell
at
paris
and
was
made
by
the
firm
of
erlanger
company
first
approached
by
this
company
in
september
slidell
consulted
mason
but
found
the
latter
strongly
committed
to
his
own
plans
with
spence
but
slidell
persisted
and
mason
gave
way
representatives
of
erlanger
proceeded
to
richmond
and
proposed
a
loan
of
million
dollars
they
were
surprised
to
find
the
confederate
government
disinclined
to
the
idea
of
a
foreign
loan
and
the
final
agreement
cut
to
fifteen
millions
was
largely
made
because
of
the
argument
advanced
that
as
a
result
powerful
influences
would
thus
be
brought
to
the
support
of
the
south
the
contract
was
signed
at
richmond
january
and
legalized
by
a
secret
act
of
congress
on
the
day
following
but
there
was
no
southern
enthusiasm
for
the
project
benjamin
wrote
to
mason
that
the
confederacy
disclaimed
the
desire
or
intention
on
our
part
to
effect
a
loan
in
europe
during
the
war
we
want
only
such
very
moderate
sums
as
are
required
abroad
for
the
purchase
of
warlike
supplies
and
for
vessels
and
even
that
is
not
required
because
of
our
want
of
funds
but
because
of
the
difficulties
of
remittance
as
for
the
erlanger
contract
the
confederacy
would
have
declined
it
altogether
but
for
the
political
considerations
indicated
by
slidell
from
mason
the
prime
need
was
to
secure
money
from
slidell
at
least
so
asserted
it
was
to
place
a
loan
with
the
purpose
of
establishing
strong
friends
it
had
been
agreed
to
suspend
the
operations
of
spence
until
the
result
of
erlanger
offer
was
learned
but
pressure
brought
by
caleb
huse
purchasing
agent
of
the
confederacy
caused
a
further
sale
of
cotton
warrants
spence
fearing
he
was
about
to
be
shelved
became
vexed
and
made
protest
to
mason
while
slidell
regarded
spence
as
a
weak
and
meddlesome
agent
but
on
february
erlanger
agents
returned
to
paris
and
uncertainty
was
at
an
end
spence
went
to
paris
saw
erlanger
and
agreed
to
in
floating
the
loan
then
followed
a
remarkable
bond
market
operation
interesting
not
so
much
as
regards
the
financial
returns
to
the
south
for
these
were
negligible
as
in
relation
to
the
declared
object
of
slidell
and
the
richmond
government
namely
the
strong
influences
that
would
accompany
the
successful
flotation
of
a
loan
delay
in
beginning
operations
was
caused
by
the
failure
to
receive
promptly
the
authenticated
copy
of
the
act
of
congress
authorizing
the
loan
which
did
not
arrive
until
march
by
this
contract
erlanger
company
sole
managers
of
the
loan
had
guaranteed
flotation
of
the
entire
at
not
less
than
the
profit
of
the
company
to
be
five
per
plus
the
difference
between
and
the
actual
price
received
but
the
first
taken
was
to
be
placed
at
once
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
the
bonds
were
put
on
the
market
march
in
london
liverpool
paris
amsterdam
and
frankfurt
but
practically
all
operations
were
confined
to
england
the
bid
for
the
loan
was
entitled
per
cent
cotton
loan
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
sterling
the
bonds
were
to
bear
interest
at
seven
per
cent
and
were
to
be
exchangeable
for
cotton
at
the
option
of
the
holder
at
the
price
of
sixpence
for
each
pound
of
cotton
at
any
time
not
later
than
six
months
after
the
ratification
of
a
treaty
of
peace
between
the
present
belligerents
there
were
provisions
for
the
gradual
redemption
of
the
bonds
in
gold
for
those
who
did
not
desire
cotton
subscribers
were
to
pay
per
cent
on
application
per
cent
on
allotment
per
cent
on
each
of
the
days
the
first
of
may
june
and
july
and
per
cent
on
the
first
of
august
september
and
october
since
the
price
of
cotton
in
england
was
then
pence
per
pound
it
was
thought
here
was
a
sufficiently
wide
margin
to
offer
at
least
a
good
chance
of
enormous
profits
to
the
buyer
of
the
bonds
true
the
loan
was
looked
upon
as
a
wild
cotton
speculation
but
odds
were
so
large
as
to
induce
a
heavy
gamblers
plunge
for
it
seemed
hardly
conceivable
that
cotton
could
for
some
years
go
below
sevenpence
per
pound
and
even
that
figure
would
have
meant
profit
the
confederacy
were
established
moreover
even
though
the
loan
was
not
given
official
recognition
by
the
london
stock
exchange
the
financial
columns
of
the
and
the
favoured
it
and
the
subscriptions
were
so
prompt
and
so
heavy
that
in
two
days
the
loan
was
reported
as
three
times
in
london
alone
with
the
closing
of
the
subscription
the
bonds
went
up
to
slidell
wrote
it
is
a
financial
recognition
of
our
independence
emanating
from
a
class
proverbially
cautious
and
little
given
to
be
influenced
by
sentiment
or
sympathy
on
friday
march
the
allotment
took
place
and
three
days
later
mason
wrote
i
think
i
may
congratulate
you
therefore
on
the
triumphant
success
of
our
infant
credit
it
shows
all
detraction
and
calumny
that
cotton
is
king
at
last
alas
for
the
king
two
days
later
his
throne
began
to
tremble
and
it
took
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
to
keep
him
in
state
on
april
the
flurry
of
speculation
had
begun
to
falter
and
the
loan
was
below
par
on
the
second
it
dropped
to
discount
and
by
the
third
the
promoters
and
the
southern
diplomats
were
very
anxious
they
agreed
that
someone
must
be
bearing
the
bonds
and
suspected
adams
of
supplying
northern
funds
for
that
purpose
spence
wrote
from
liverpool
in
great
alarm
and
coincidently
erlanger
company
urged
that
mason
should
authorize
the
use
of
the
receipts
already
secured
to
hold
up
the
price
of
the
bonds
mason
was
very
reluctant
to
do
this
but
finally
yielded
when
informed
of
the
result
of
an
interview
between
spence
erlanger
and
the
latter
chief
london
agent
schroeder
spence
had
proposed
a
withdrawal
of
a
part
of
the
loan
from
the
market
as
likely
to
have
a
stabilizing
effect
and
opposed
the
erlanger
plan
of
using
the
funds
already
in
hand
but
schroeder
coolly
informed
him
that
if
the
confederate
representative
refused
to
authorize
the
use
of
these
funds
to
sustain
the
market
then
erlanger
would
regard
his
company
as
having
completed
their
contract
which
was
simply
to
issue
the
loan
having
issued
it
they
did
not
and
do
not
guarantee
that
the
public
would
pay
up
their
instalments
if
the
public
abandon
the
loan
the
per
cent
sacrificed
is
in
point
of
fact
not
the
property
of
the
government
at
all
but
the
profits
of
erlanger
actually
in
their
hands
and
they
can
not
be
expected
to
take
a
worse
position
at
any
rate
they
will
not
do
so
and
unless
the
compact
can
be
made
on
the
basis
we
name
matters
must
take
their
course
in
the
face
of
this
ultimatum
spence
advised
yielding
as
he
could
not
hesitate
seeing
that
nothing
could
be
so
disastrous
politically
as
well
as
financially
as
the
public
of
the
loan
mason
gave
the
required
authorization
and
this
was
later
approved
from
richmond
for
a
time
the
bulling
of
the
loan
was
successful
but
again
and
again
required
the
use
of
funds
received
from
actual
sales
of
bonds
and
in
the
end
the
loan
netted
very
little
to
the
confederacy
some
was
squandered
in
supporting
the
market
and
from
the
entire
operation
it
is
estimated
that
less
than
was
realized
by
the
confederacy
although
as
stated
by
the
over
of
the
bonds
were
outstanding
and
largely
in
the
hands
of
british
investors
at
the
end
of
the
war
the
loan
soon
became
not
as
had
been
hoped
and
prophesied
by
slidell
a
source
of
valuable
public
support
but
rather
a
mere
barometer
of
southern
fortunes
from
first
to
last
the
confederate
cotton
loan
bore
to
subscribers
the
aspect
of
a
speculative
venture
and
lacked
the
regard
attached
to
sound
investment
this
fact
in
itself
denied
to
the
loan
any
such
favourable
influence
or
financial
recognition
of
the
confederacy
as
mason
and
slidell
in
the
first
flush
of
success
attributed
to
it
the
rapid
fluctuations
in
price
further
discredited
it
and
tended
to
emphasize
the
uncertainty
of
southern
victory
thus
confidence
in
the
south
was
if
anything
lessened
instead
of
increased
by
this
turning
from
political
to
financial
methods
of
bringing
pressure
upon
the
government
southern
political
and
parliamentary
pressure
had
indeed
been
reserved
from
january
to
june
public
attention
was
distracted
from
the
war
in
america
by
the
polish
question
which
for
a
time
particularly
during
the
months
of
march
and
april
disturbed
the
good
relations
existing
between
england
and
france
since
the
emperor
seemed
bent
on
going
beyond
british
meddling
even
to
pursuing
a
policy
that
easily
might
lead
to
war
with
russia
europe
diverted
interest
from
america
and
napoleon
himself
was
for
the
moment
more
concerned
over
the
polish
question
than
with
american
affairs
even
though
the
mexican
venture
was
still
a
worry
to
him
it
was
no
time
for
a
british
parliamentary
push
and
when
a
question
was
raised
on
the
cotton
famine
in
lancashire
little
attention
was
given
it
though
ordinarily
it
would
have
been
seized
upon
as
an
opportunity
for
a
demonstration
this
was
a
bitter
attack
by
one
ferrand
in
the
commons
on
april
directed
against
the
cotton
manufacturers
as
lukewarm
over
employees
sufferings
potter
a
leading
cotton
manufacturer
replied
to
the
attack
potter
and
his
brother
were
already
prominent
as
strong
partisans
of
the
north
yet
no
effort
was
made
to
use
the
debate
to
the
advantage
of
the
south
in
late
may
both
necessity
and
fortuitous
circumstance
seemed
to
make
advisable
another
southern
effort
in
parliament
the
cotton
loan
though
fairly
strong
again
because
of
confederate
governmental
aid
was
in
fact
a
failure
in
its
expected
result
of
public
support
for
the
south
something
must
be
done
to
offset
that
failure
in
polish
affairs
france
had
drawn
back
presumably
napoleon
was
again
eager
for
some
active
effort
best
of
all
the
military
situation
in
america
was
thought
to
indicate
southern
success
grant
western
campaign
had
come
to
a
halt
with
the
stubborn
resistance
of
the
great
mississippi
stronghold
at
vicksburg
while
in
virginia
lee
on
may
had
overwhelmingly
defeated
hooker
at
chancellorsville
and
was
preparing
at
last
a
definite
offensive
campaign
into
northern
territory
lee
advance
north
did
not
begin
until
june
but
his
plan
was
early
known
in
a
select
circle
in
england
and
much
was
expected
of
it
the
time
seemed
ripe
therefore
and
the
result
was
notification
by
roebuck
of
a
motion
for
the
recognition
of
the
confederacy
first
step
the
real
purpose
of
which
was
to
attempt
that
to
the
tories
which
had
been
advocated
by
spence
in
january
but
postponed
on
the
advice
of
gregory
clearly
indicated
where
lay
the
wind
no
one
it
declared
now
asks
what
will
be
the
policy
of
great
britain
towards
america
but
everybody
anxiously
waits
on
what
the
emperor
of
the
french
will
do
england
pays
one
of
the
inevitable
penalties
of
free
government
and
of
material
prosperity
that
of
having
at
times
at
the
head
of
national
affairs
statesmen
who
belong
rather
to
the
past
than
to
the
present
and
whose
skill
and
merit
are
rather
the
business
tact
and
knowledge
of
details
acquired
by
long
experience
than
the
quick
and
prescient
comprehension
of
the
requirements
of
sudden
emergencies
the
nominal
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
is
in
the
hands
of
a
diplomatic
malaprop
who
has
never
shown
vigour
activity
or
determination
except
where
the
display
of
these
qualities
was
singularly
unneeded
or
even
worse
than
useless
from
great
britain
then
under
her
actual
government
the
cabinet
at
washington
has
nothing
to
fear
and
the
confederate
states
nothing
to
expect
of
main
interest
to
the
public
was
the
military
situation
the
minimized
the
western
campaigns
regarding
them
as
required
for
political
effect
to
hold
the
states
loyal
to
the
union
and
while
indulging
in
no
prophecies
as
to
the
fate
of
vicksburg
expressing
the
opinion
that
if
forced
to
surrender
it
the
south
could
easily
establish
a
new
vicksburg
at
some
other
point
naturally
was
pleased
with
and
supported
this
view
such
ignorance
of
the
geographic
importance
of
vicksburg
may
seem
like
wilful
misleading
of
the
public
but
professed
british
military
experts
were
equally
ignorant
captain
chesney
professor
of
military
history
at
sandhurst
college
published
in
an
analysis
of
american
campaigns
centering
all
attention
on
the
battles
in
maryland
and
virginia
and
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
south
could
resist
indefinitely
any
northern
attack
he
dismissed
the
western
campaigns
as
of
no
real
significance
russell
now
editor
of
the
and
navy
better
understood
grant
objectives
on
the
mississippi
but
believed
northern
reconquest
of
the
south
to
the
point
of
restoration
of
the
union
to
be
impossible
if
however
newspaper
comments
on
the
success
of
southern
armies
were
to
be
regarded
as
favourable
to
roebuck
motion
for
recognition
russell
was
against
it
if
we
could
perceive
the
smallest
prospect
of
awaking
the
north
to
the
truth
or
of
saving
the
south
from
the
loss
and
trials
of
the
contest
by
recognition
we
would
vote
for
it
but
next
to
the
delusion
of
the
north
that
it
can
breathe
the
breath
of
life
into
the
corpse
of
the
murdered
union
again
is
the
delusion
of
some
people
in
england
who
imagine
that
by
recognition
we
would
give
life
to
the
south
divide
the
nations
on
each
side
of
the
black
and
white
line
for
ever
and
bring
this
war
to
the
end
there
is
probably
not
one
of
these
clamourers
for
recognition
who
could
define
the
limits
of
the
state
to
be
recognized
and
over
and
above
all
recognition
unless
it
meant
would
be
an
aggravation
of
the
horrors
of
the
contest
it
would
not
aid
the
south
one
whit
and
it
would
add
immensely
to
the
unity
and
the
fury
of
the
north
the
british
foreign
secretary
was
at
first
little
concerned
at
motion
writing
to
lyons
you
will
see
that
roebuck
has
given
notice
of
a
motion
to
recognize
the
south
but
i
think
it
certain
that
neither
lord
derby
nor
cobden
will
support
it
and
i
should
think
no
great
number
of
the
liberal
party
offshoots
from
all
parties
will
compose
the
minority
russell
was
correct
in
this
view
but
not
so
did
it
appear
to
southern
agents
who
now
became
active
at
the
request
of
roebuck
and
lindsay
in
securing
from
the
emperor
renewed
expressions
of
willingness
to
act
and
promptly
if
england
would
but
give
the
word
there
was
no
real
hope
that
russell
would
change
his
policy
but
there
seemed
at
least
a
chance
of
replacing
the
whig
ministry
with
a
tory
one
the
date
for
the
discussion
of
the
motion
had
been
set
for
june
on
june
lindsay
writing
to
slidell
enclosed
a
letter
from
roebuck
asking
for
an
interview
with
napoleon
and
on
june
mason
wrote
that
if
slidell
saw
the
emperor
it
was
of
the
greatest
importance
that
he
mason
should
be
at
once
informed
of
the
results
and
how
far
he
might
communicate
them
to
our
friends
in
the
house
slidell
saw
the
emperor
on
june
talked
of
the
possibility
of
forcing
the
english
cabinet
to
act
or
to
give
way
to
a
new
ministry
asked
that
an
interview
be
given
lindsay
and
roebuck
and
hinted
that
lord
malmesbury
a
warm
friend
of
the
emperor
would
probably
be
the
foreign
secretary
in
a
tory
cabinet
napoleon
made
no
comment
indicating
any
purpose
to
aid
in
upsetting
the
palmerston
government
but
consented
to
the
requested
interview
and
declared
he
would
go
to
the
length
of
officially
informing
the
british
ministry
that
france
was
very
ready
to
discuss
the
advisability
of
recognizing
the
south
this
was
good
news
june
slidell
received
a
note
from
mocquard
stating
that
baron
gros
the
french
ambassador
at
london
had
been
instructed
to
sound
russell
meanwhile
roebuck
and
lindsay
had
hurried
to
paris
june
saw
napoleon
and
on
the
slidell
reported
that
they
were
authorized
to
state
in
the
house
of
commons
that
france
was
not
only
willing
but
anxious
to
recognize
the
confederate
states
with
the
of
england
slidell
added
however
that
napoleon
had
not
promised
roebuck
and
lindsay
to
make
a
formal
proposal
to
great
britain
this
rested
on
the
assurances
received
by
slidell
from
mocquard
and
when
mason
who
had
let
the
assurance
be
known
to
his
friends
wrote
that
russell
replying
to
clanricarde
on
june
had
denied
any
official
communication
from
france
and
asked
for
authority
from
slidell
to
back
up
his
statements
by
being
permitted
to
give
roebuck
a
copy
of
the
supposed
instruction
he
received
a
reply
indicating
confusion
somewhere
i
called
yesterday
on
my
friend
at
the
affaires
etrangeres
on
the
subject
of
your
note
of
saturday
he
has
just
left
me
de
lh
will
not
give
a
copy
of
his
instructions
to
baron
gros
but
this
is
the
substance
of
it
on
the
he
directed
baron
gros
to
take
occasion
to
say
to
leading
members
of
parliament
that
the
emperor
opinions
on
the
subject
of
american
affairs
were
unchanged
that
he
was
disposed
with
the
of
england
immediately
to
recognize
the
confederate
states
this
was
in
the
form
of
a
draft
letter
not
a
despatch
on
the
he
officially
instructed
the
baron
to
sound
on
the
subject
and
to
inform
him
of
the
emperor
views
and
wishes
this
was
done
in
consequence
of
a
note
from
the
emperor
to
the
minister
in
which
he
said
me
demande
ne
serait
bien
lord
palmerston
que
je
suis
décidé
à
reconnaître
le
sud
this
is
by
far
the
most
significant
thing
that
the
emperor
has
said
either
to
me
or
to
the
others
it
renders
me
comparatively
indifferent
what
england
may
do
or
omit
doing
at
all
events
let
roebuck
press
his
motion
and
make
his
statement
of
the
declaration
lord
palmerston
will
not
dare
to
dispute
it
and
the
responsibility
of
the
continuance
of
the
war
will
rest
entirely
upon
him
drouyn
de
lhuys
has
not
heard
from
baron
gros
the
result
of
his
interview
with
palmerston
i
see
that
the
latter
has
been
unwell
and
it
is
probable
that
the
former
had
not
been
able
to
see
him
there
can
be
no
impropriety
in
roebuck
seeing
baron
gros
who
will
doubtless
give
him
information
which
he
will
use
to
advantage
i
write
in
great
haste
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
let
lord
campbell
know
the
substance
of
this
note
omitting
that
portion
of
it
which
relates
to
the
inclination
to
act
alone
pray
excuse
me
to
lord
campbell
for
not
writing
to
him
time
not
permitting
me
to
do
so
this
did
not
satisfy
mason
he
telegraphed
on
the
can
i
put
in
hands
of
roebuck
copy
of
mocquard
note
brought
by
corcoran
to
which
slidell
replied
by
letter
for
fear
the
telegraph
may
commit
some
blunder
i
write
to
say
that
mocquard
note
being
confidential
can
not
be
in
any
i
showed
it
to
roebuck
and
lindsay
when
they
were
here
and
have
no
objection
that
they
should
again
see
it
confidentially
on
june
roebuck
went
to
baron
gros
and
received
the
information
that
no
formal
communication
had
been
made
to
russell
the
next
day
in
an
effort
in
some
way
to
secure
an
admission
of
what
mason
and
his
friends
believed
to
be
the
truth
lord
campbell
asked
russell
in
the
house
of
lords
if
he
had
received
either
a
document
or
a
verbal
communication
outlining
napoleon
desires
russell
replied
that
baron
gros
had
told
him
an
hour
ago
that
he
had
not
even
received
any
instruction
to
deliver
such
a
communication
this
was
in
the
hours
preceding
the
debate
now
finally
to
occur
in
the
commons
evidently
there
had
been
an
error
in
the
understanding
of
napoleon
by
slidell
roebuck
and
lindsay
or
else
there
was
a
question
of
veracity
between
russell
baron
gros
and
napoleon
roebuck
motion
was
couched
in
the
form
of
a
request
to
the
queen
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
foreign
powers
for
in
recognition
of
the
confederacy
roebuck
argued
that
the
south
had
in
fact
established
its
independence
and
that
this
was
greatly
to
advantage
since
it
put
an
end
to
the
threatening
great
power
in
the
west
he
repeated
old
arguments
based
on
suffering
in
lancashire
a
point
his
opponents
brushed
aside
as
no
longer
of
dangerous
concern
attacked
british
sentiment
as
mere
hypocrisy
and
minimized
the
dangers
of
a
war
with
the
north
prophesying
an
easy
victory
for
great
britain
then
warmed
to
the
real
attack
on
the
government
roebuck
related
at
length
his
interview
with
napoleon
claiming
to
have
been
commissioned
by
the
emperor
to
urge
england
to
action
and
asserting
that
since
baron
gros
had
been
instructed
to
apply
again
to
the
british
cabinet
it
must
be
evident
that
the
ministry
was
concealing
something
from
parliament
almost
immediately
however
he
added
that
napoleon
had
told
him
no
formal
french
application
could
be
renewed
to
great
britain
since
russell
had
revealed
to
seward
through
lyons
the
contents
of
a
former
application
thus
following
the
usual
arguments
now
somewhat
perfunctorily
given
the
bolt
against
the
government
had
been
shot
with
all
of
roebuck
accustomed
vigour
of
utterance
here
was
direct
attack
that
it
was
a
futile
one
early
became
evident
in
the
debate
lord
robert
montagu
while
professing
himself
a
friend
of
the
south
was
sarcastic
at
the
expense
of
roebuck
entrance
into
the
field
of
diplomacy
enlarged
upon
the
real
dangers
of
becoming
involved
in
the
war
and
moved
an
amendment
in
favour
of
continued
british
neutrality
palmerston
was
absent
being
ill
but
gladstone
for
the
government
while
carefully
avoiding
expressions
of
sympathy
for
either
north
or
south
yet
going
out
of
his
way
to
pass
a
moral
judgment
on
the
disaster
to
political
liberty
if
the
north
should
wholly
crush
the
south
was
positive
in
assertion
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
adopt
either
motion
or
montagu
amendment
great
britain
should
not
herself
to
any
line
of
policy
especially
as
military
events
were
now
occurring
which
might
greatly
alter
the
whole
situation
though
the
main
result
of
the
contest
was
not
doubtful
here
spoke
that
element
of
the
ministry
still
convinced
of
ultimate
southern
success
if
gladstone
had
been
the
only
reply
to
roebuck
he
and
his
friends
might
well
have
thought
they
were
about
to
secure
a
ministerial
change
of
front
but
it
soon
appeared
that
gladstone
spoke
more
for
himself
than
for
the
government
roebuck
had
made
a
direct
accusation
and
in
meeting
this
layard
for
the
foreign
office
entered
a
positive
and
emphatical
denial
in
which
he
was
supported
by
sir
george
grey
home
secretary
who
added
sharp
criticism
of
roebuck
for
permitting
himself
to
be
made
the
channel
of
a
french
complaint
against
england
it
early
became
evident
to
the
friends
of
the
south
that
an
error
in
tactics
had
been
committed
and
in
two
directions
first
in
the
assertion
that
a
new
french
offer
had
been
made
when
it
was
impossible
to
present
proof
of
it
and
second
in
bringing
forward
what
amounted
to
an
attempt
to
unseat
the
ministry
without
previously
committing
the
tories
to
a
support
of
the
motion
apparently
disraeli
was
simply
letting
roebuck
feel
out
the
house
the
only
member
of
the
tory
party
strongly
supporting
him
was
lord
robert
cecil
in
a
speech
so
clearly
a
mere
party
one
that
it
served
to
increase
the
strength
of
ministerial
resistance
friends
of
the
north
quickly
appreciated
the
situation
and
in
strong
speeches
supported
the
neutrality
policy
of
the
government
forster
laid
stress
upon
the
danger
of
war
and
the
strength
of
british
emancipation
sentiment
as
did
bright
in
what
was
read
the
most
powerful
of
all
his
parliamentary
utterances
on
the
american
war
in
particular
bright
voiced
a
general
disbelief
in
the
accuracy
of
roebuck
report
of
his
interview
with
napoleon
called
upon
his
friend
lindsay
for
his
version
of
the
affair
and
concluded
by
recalling
former
speeches
by
roebuck
in
which
the
latter
had
been
fond
of
talking
about
the
perjured
lips
of
napoleon
bright
dilated
upon
the
egotism
and
insolence
of
roebuck
in
trying
to
represent
the
emperor
of
france
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
commons
the
emperor
he
asserted
was
in
great
danger
of
being
too
much
represented
in
parliament
the
result
of
this
first
day
debate
on
june
was
disconcerting
to
southern
friends
it
had
been
adjourned
without
a
vote
for
which
they
were
duly
thankful
especially
disconcerting
was
slidell
refusal
to
permit
the
citation
of
mocquard
note
in
proof
of
roebuck
assertions
mason
wrote
i
have
your
note
of
ult
you
will
see
in
the
papers
of
the
debate
in
the
house
last
night
at
which
i
was
present
and
will
have
seen
what
in
the
lord
russell
said
in
reply
to
lord
campbell
thus
the
french
affair
remains
in
a
unless
the
emperor
will
show
his
hand
we
shall
never
know
what
he
really
means
or
derive
any
benefit
from
his
private
and
individual
revelations
as
things
now
stand
before
the
public
there
can
be
but
one
opinion
that
he
holds
one
language
in
private
communications
though
liberty
to
divulge
and
another
to
his
ambassador
here
the
debate
is
adjourned
to
night
when
lindsay
will
give
in
his
explanation
it
would
be
uncivil
to
say
that
i
have
no
confidence
in
the
emperor
but
certainly
what
has
come
from
him
so
far
can
invite
only
distrust
as
in
parliament
so
in
the
public
press
immediate
recognition
of
the
confederacy
received
little
support
the
while
sympathetic
with
the
purpose
was
against
roebuck
motion
considering
it
of
no
value
unless
backed
up
by
force
to
this
the
was
decidedly
opposed
of
like
opinion
was
the
declaring
that
premature
recognition
was
a
justifiable
ground
for
a
declaration
of
war
by
the
north
july
roebuck
asked
when
the
debate
was
to
be
renewed
and
was
told
that
must
wait
on
palmerston
recovery
and
return
to
the
house
bright
pressed
for
an
immediate
decision
layard
reaffirmed
very
positively
that
no
communication
had
been
received
from
france
and
disclosed
that
napoleon
alleged
complaint
of
a
british
revelation
to
seward
of
french
overtures
was
a
myth
since
the
document
in
question
had
been
printed
in
the
thus
attracting
attention
thus
roebuck
was
further
discredited
july
spence
wrote
strongly
urging
the
withdrawal
of
the
motion
i
have
a
letter
from
an
eminent
member
of
the
house
and
great
friend
of
the
south
urging
the
danger
of
carrying
roebuck
motion
to
a
vote
it
is
plain
it
will
be
defeated
by
a
great
majority
and
the
effect
of
this
will
encourage
the
north
and
distress
our
friends
it
will
also
strengthen
the
minority
of
the
cabinet
in
favour
of
the
north
the
fact
is
the
ground
of
the
motion
which
was
action
on
the
part
of
france
has
failed
us
and
taken
shape
which
tells
injuriously
instead
of
being
the
great
support
if
a
positive
engagement
were
made
by
disraeli
to
support
the
motion
it
would
alter
the
question
entirely
in
the
absence
of
this
i
fear
the
vote
would
be
humiliating
and
would
convey
an
impression
wholly
delusive
for
the
members
are
to
in
favour
of
the
south
and
yet
on
this
point
the
vote
might
be
to
against
southern
interests
on
july
palmerston
was
back
in
the
house
and
roebuck
secured
an
agreement
for
a
resumption
of
the
debate
on
monday
next
meantime
many
powerful
organs
of
the
french
press
had
taken
up
the
matter
and
were
full
of
sharp
criticism
of
napoleon
supposed
policy
and
actions
as
stated
by
roebuck
the
effect
in
england
was
to
create
a
feeling
that
napoleon
might
have
difficulty
in
carrying
out
a
policy
palmerston
wishing
to
avoid
further
discussion
on
napoleon
share
in
providing
fuel
for
the
debate
wrote
in
a
very
conciliatory
and
pleasant
way
to
roebuck
on
july
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
thus
privately
to
urge
upon
you
and
through
you
upon
lindsay
the
expediency
of
dropping
altogether
whether
your
debate
goes
on
or
not
all
further
mention
or
discussion
of
what
passed
between
you
and
lindsay
on
the
one
hand
and
the
emperor
of
the
french
on
the
other
in
truth
the
whole
proceeding
on
this
subject
the
other
day
seems
to
me
to
have
been
very
irregular
the
british
parliament
receives
messages
and
communications
from
their
own
sovereign
but
not
from
the
sovereigns
of
other
countries
no
good
can
come
of
touching
again
upon
this
matter
nor
from
fixing
upon
the
emperor
a
mistake
which
amid
the
multiplicity
of
things
he
has
to
think
of
he
may
be
excused
for
making
i
am
very
anxious
that
neither
you
nor
lindsay
should
mention
those
matters
any
more
as
any
discussion
about
them
must
tend
to
impair
the
good
relations
between
the
french
and
english
governments
might
i
ask
you
to
show
this
note
to
lindsay
your
fellow
traveller
the
next
day
in
the
commons
sir
james
ferguson
appealed
to
roebuck
to
withdraw
his
motion
altogether
as
inexpedient
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
events
in
america
and
as
sure
to
be
defeated
if
pressed
to
a
vote
palmerston
approved
this
suggestion
and
urged
that
if
the
debate
be
continued
speakers
should
refrain
from
all
further
mention
of
the
personal
questions
that
had
been
raised
since
these
were
not
proper
matters
for
discussion
in
the
house
and
were
embarrassing
to
the
french
emperor
but
palmerston
skill
in
management
was
unavailing
in
this
case
and
the
muss
as
mason
called
it
was
continued
when
lindsay
entered
upon
a
long
account
of
the
interview
with
napoleon
renewed
the
accusations
of
russell
revelations
to
seward
and
advised
roebuck
not
to
withdraw
his
motion
but
to
postpone
it
until
monday
the
he
said
was
due
and
any
moment
news
from
america
might
change
the
governmental
policy
again
the
fat
was
in
the
fire
palmerston
sharply
disavowed
that
news
would
change
policy
kinglake
thought
actions
should
be
thoroughly
investigated
forster
eagerly
pressed
for
continuation
of
the
debate
there
was
a
general
criticism
of
diplomacy
and
of
lindsay
also
northern
friends
were
jubilant
and
those
of
the
south
embarrassed
and
uncertain
gregory
believed
that
the
motion
should
be
withdrawn
in
the
interest
of
the
south
but
lord
robert
cecil
renewed
lindsay
advice
to
wait
until
monday
and
this
was
finally
done
all
england
was
in
fact
eagerly
waiting
for
news
from
america
advance
was
known
to
have
passed
by
washington
but
no
reports
were
yet
at
hand
of
the
battle
which
must
determine
this
first
great
offensive
campaign
by
the
south
july
the
predicted
editorially
that
lee
was
about
to
capture
washington
and
that
this
event
would
be
met
by
a
great
cry
of
joy
and
relief
in
the
north
now
weary
of
the
war
and
eager
to
escape
from
the
despotism
of
lincoln
administration
nevertheless
the
while
still
confident
of
lee
victorious
advance
and
of
the
welcome
likely
to
be
accorded
him
in
the
north
came
out
strongly
on
july
in
an
appeal
to
roebuck
to
withdraw
his
motion
arguing
that
even
if
he
were
successful
great
britain
ought
to
make
no
hurried
change
of
policy
on
this
day
the
thirteenth
roebuck
moved
the
discharge
of
his
motion
in
a
speech
so
mild
as
to
leave
the
impression
that
tear
had
his
tail
between
his
legs
but
lindsay
his
feelings
evidently
injured
by
the
aspersions
cast
upon
his
own
amateur
diplomacy
spoke
at
much
length
of
the
interview
with
napoleon
and
tried
to
show
that
on
a
previous
occasion
he
had
been
in
fact
employed
by
the
government
palmerston
was
pithy
and
sarcastic
in
reply
lindsay
he
said
had
employed
himself
he
hoped
that
this
would
be
the
last
time
when
any
member
of
this
house
shall
think
it
his
duty
to
communicate
to
the
british
house
of
commons
that
which
may
have
passed
between
himself
and
the
sovereign
of
a
foreign
country
the
entire
debate
on
roebuck
motion
was
a
serious
blow
to
the
cause
of
the
south
in
parliament
undertaken
on
a
complete
misunderstanding
of
the
position
of
tory
leaders
begun
with
a
vehemence
that
led
its
mover
into
tactical
error
it
rapidly
dwindled
to
a
mere
question
of
personal
veracity
and
concluded
in
sharp
reproof
from
the
government
no
doubt
the
very
success
so
it
seemed
at
the
moment
of
southern
arms
upon
which
roebuck
counted
to
support
his
motion
was
in
actual
effect
a
deterrent
since
many
southern
sympathizers
thought
great
britain
might
now
keep
hands
off
since
the
south
was
winning
anyway
there
is
no
evidence
that
russell
thought
this
or
that
he
was
moved
by
any
consideration
save
the
fixed
determination
to
remain
neutral
even
to
the
extent
of
reversing
a
previous
decision
as
to
the
powers
of
the
government
in
relation
to
southern
roebuck
withdrew
his
motion
not
because
of
any
imminent
southern
victory
but
because
he
knew
that
if
pressed
to
a
vote
it
would
be
overwhelmingly
defeated
the
debate
was
the
last
one
of
importance
on
the
topics
of
mediation
or
recognition
news
of
lee
check
at
gettysburg
reached
london
on
july
but
was
described
by
the
two
days
later
as
virtually
a
southern
victory
since
the
northern
army
had
been
compelled
to
act
wholly
on
the
defensive
in
the
same
issue
it
was
stated
of
vicksburg
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
possible
hope
there
can
be
of
reducing
the
city
but
on
july
full
news
of
the
events
of
july
when
vicksburg
fell
and
lee
began
his
retreat
from
gettysburg
was
received
and
its
significance
acknowledged
though
efforts
were
made
to
prove
that
these
events
simply
showed
that
neither
side
could
conquer
the
other
in
contradiction
of
previous
assertions
that
another
vicksburg
might
easily
be
set
up
to
oppose
northern
advance
in
the
west
there
was
now
acknowledgment
that
the
capture
of
this
one
remaining
barrier
on
the
mississippi
was
a
great
disaster
to
the
south
forgetful
that
it
was
supposedly
a
british
publication
declared
the
saddest
news
which
has
reached
since
the
fall
of
new
orleans
is
the
account
of
the
surrender
of
vicksburg
the
on
which
the
capitulation
took
place
renders
the
blow
heavier
the
fall
of
vicksburg
wrote
spence
has
made
me
ill
all
the
week
never
yet
being
able
to
drive
it
off
my
mind
adams
reported
that
the
news
had
caused
a
panic
among
the
holders
of
the
cotton
loan
bonds
and
that
the
press
and
upper
classes
were
exceedingly
glad
they
had
refused
support
of
roebuck
motion
if
july
may
in
any
way
be
regarded
as
the
crisis
of
southern
effort
in
england
it
is
only
as
a
despairing
one
doomed
to
failure
from
the
outset
and
receiving
a
further
severe
by
the
of
lee
campaign
into
pennsylvania
the
real
crisis
of
governmental
attitude
had
long
since
passed
naturally
this
was
not
acknowledged
by
the
staunch
friends
of
the
south
any
more
than
at
richmond
it
was
acknowledged
or
understood
that
gettysburg
marked
the
crisis
of
the
confederacy
but
that
the
end
of
southern
hope
for
british
intervention
had
come
at
richmond
was
made
clear
by
the
action
of
benjamin
the
confederate
secretary
of
state
on
august
he
recalled
mason
writing
that
the
recent
debates
in
parliament
showed
the
government
determined
not
to
receive
him
under
these
circumstances
your
continued
residence
in
london
is
neither
conducive
to
the
interests
nor
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
this
government
and
the
president
therefore
requests
that
you
consider
your
mission
at
an
end
and
that
you
withdraw
with
your
secretary
from
london
a
private
letter
accompanying
the
instruction
authorized
mason
to
remain
if
there
were
any
marked
change
in
governmental
attitude
but
since
the
decision
of
the
ministry
to
seize
the
laird
rams
had
been
made
public
at
nearly
the
same
moment
when
this
instruction
was
received
september
mason
could
hardly
fail
to
retire
promptly
indeed
the
very
fact
of
that
seizure
gave
opportunity
for
a
dramatic
exit
though
there
was
no
connection
between
benjamin
instruction
and
the
stopping
of
confederate
in
england
the
real
connection
was
with
the
failure
of
the
gettysburg
campaign
and
the
humiliating
collapse
of
roebuck
motion
even
the
was
now
expanding
upon
the
serious
reverses
of
the
south
and
making
it
clearly
understood
that
england
has
not
had
and
will
not
have
the
slightest
inclination
to
intervention
or
mediation
or
to
take
any
position
except
that
of
strict
neutrality
mason
at
once
notified
slidell
of
his
receipt
of
the
recall
instruction
and
secured
the
latter
approval
of
the
communication
he
proposed
making
to
russell
a
general
consultation
of
southern
agents
took
place
and
mason
would
have
been
vexed
had
he
known
how
small
was
the
regard
for
his
abilities
as
a
diplomat
hastened
to
join
in
a
note
already
struck
at
richmond
of
warm
welcome
to
france
in
her
conquest
of
mexico
reprinting
on
september
an
editorial
from
the
in
which
it
was
declared
france
is
the
only
power
in
the
world
that
has
manifested
any
friendly
feeling
towards
the
confederacy
in
its
terrible
struggle
for
independence
evidently
all
hope
was
now
centred
upon
napoleon
a
conclusion
without
doubt
distasteful
to
mason
and
one
which
he
was
loth
to
accept
as
final
on
september
mason
notified
russell
of
his
withdrawal
very
nearly
in
the
words
of
benjamin
instruction
the
news
was
at
once
made
public
calling
out
from
the
a
hectoring
editorial
on
the
folly
of
the
south
in
demanding
recognition
before
it
had
won
it
in
general
however
the
press
took
a
tone
apparently
intended
to
let
mason
down
easily
acknowledging
that
his
act
indicated
a
universal
understanding
that
great
britain
would
not
alter
her
policy
of
strict
neutrality
but
expressing
admiration
for
the
courage
and
confidence
of
the
south
september
russell
replied
to
mason
with
courtesy
but
also
with
seeming
finality
i
have
on
other
occasions
explained
to
you
the
reasons
which
have
induced
her
majesty
government
to
decline
the
overtures
you
allude
to
and
the
motives
which
have
hitherto
prevented
the
british
court
from
recognizing
you
as
the
accredited
minister
of
an
established
state
these
reasons
are
still
in
force
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
them
i
regret
that
circumstances
have
prevented
my
cultivating
your
personal
acquaintance
which
in
a
different
state
of
affairs
i
should
have
done
with
much
pleasure
and
satisfaction
thus
mason
took
his
exit
brief
entrances
upon
the
stage
in
england
were
still
to
be
his
but
the
chief
rôle
there
was
now
assigned
to
others
and
the
principal
scenes
transferred
to
france
that
mason
did
not
fully
concur
in
this
as
final
easily
as
it
was
accepted
by
slidell
is
evident
from
his
later
correspondence
with
lindsay
and
spence
he
regarded
the
question
of
british
recognition
of
the
south
as
mainly
an
english
political
question
pinning
his
hopes
on
a
tory
overthrow
of
palmerston
ministry
this
he
believed
to
depend
on
the
life
of
the
prime
minister
and
his
anxious
inquiries
as
to
the
health
of
palmerston
were
frequent
nothing
in
his
instructions
indicated
a
desired
course
of
action
and
mason
after
consulting
slidell
and
naturally
securing
his
acquiescence
determined
to
remain
in
europe
waiting
events
if
the
south
was
indignant
at
british
inaction
the
north
was
correspondingly
pleased
and
after
the
seizure
of
the
laird
rams
was
officially
very
friendly
at
least
so
lyons
reported
in
this
same
private
letter
however
lyons
ventured
a
strong
protest
against
a
notion
which
now
seems
to
have
occurred
to
russell
of
joint
action
by
england
france
and
spain
to
withdraw
belligerent
rights
the
unless
the
united
states
formally
concede
to
their
enemy
the
status
of
a
belligerent
for
all
purposes
why
or
how
this
idea
came
to
be
taken
up
by
russell
is
uncertain
possibly
it
was
the
result
of
irritation
created
by
the
persistence
of
seward
in
denying
that
the
war
was
other
than
an
effort
to
crush
rebellious
subjects
theory
clearly
against
the
fact
yet
consistently
maintained
by
the
american
secretary
of
state
throughout
the
entire
war
and
constantly
causing
difficulties
in
relations
with
neutral
countries
at
any
rate
lyons
was
quick
to
see
the
danger
he
wrote
such
a
declaration
might
produce
a
furious
outburst
of
wrath
from
government
and
public
here
it
can
not
however
be
denied
that
the
reasoning
on
which
the
declaration
would
be
founded
would
be
incontrovertible
and
that
in
the
end
firmness
answers
better
with
the
americans
than
coaxing
but
then
england
france
and
spain
must
be
really
firm
and
not
allow
their
declaration
to
be
a
if
on
its
being
met
as
it
very
probably
would
be
by
a
decided
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
they
did
not
proceed
to
break
up
the
blockade
or
at
all
events
to
resist
by
force
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
visit
on
the
high
seas
the
united
states
government
and
people
would
become
more
difficult
to
deal
with
than
ever
i
find
however
that
i
am
going
beyond
my
own
province
and
i
will
therefore
add
only
an
excuse
for
doing
so
lyons
followed
this
up
a
week
later
by
a
long
description
of
readiness
for
a
foreign
war
a
situation
very
different
from
that
of
america
he
said
had
steadily
been
preparing
for
such
a
contingency
not
with
any
desire
for
it
but
that
she
might
not
be
caught
napping
this
was
written
as
if
merely
an
interesting
general
speculation
and
was
accompanied
by
the
assurance
i
do
think
the
government
here
at
all
desires
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
us
or
with
any
european
power
but
the
better
prepared
it
is
the
less
manageable
it
will
be
nevertheless
lyons
concern
over
russell
motion
of
withdrawing
belligerent
rights
to
the
north
was
great
and
his
representations
presumably
had
effect
for
no
more
was
heard
of
the
matter
russell
relieved
lyons
mind
by
writing
november
i
hope
you
continue
to
go
on
quietly
with
seward
i
think
this
is
better
than
any
violent
demonstrations
of
friendship
which
might
turn
sour
like
beer
if
there
should
be
a
but
i
am
more
and
more
persuaded
that
amongst
the
powers
with
whose
ministers
i
pass
my
time
there
is
none
with
whom
our
relations
ought
to
be
so
frank
and
cordial
as
the
united
states
if
relations
with
the
north
were
now
to
be
so
frank
and
cordial
there
was
indeed
little
remaining
hope
possible
to
english
friends
of
the
south
bright
wrote

sumner
neutrality
is
agreed
upon
by
all

more
fair
and
friendly

sure
that
previous
british
confidence
in
the
ultimate
success
of
the
south
was
rapidly
declining
such
utterances
if
well
founded
might
well
have
portended
the
cessation
of
further
southern
effort
in
england
that
a
renewal
of
activity
soon
occurred
was
due
largely
to
a
sudden
shift
in
the
military
situation
in
america
and
to
the
realization
that
the
heretofore
largely
negative
support
given
to
the
southern
cause
must
be
replaced
by
organized
and
persistent
effort

grip
upon
that
city

should
hurry
the
organization
of
the
southern
independence
association
seeking
a
specific
point

and
again
hoping
for

support
they

fixed
their
attention

trial
of
the
on
appeal
from

decision
by

court

on

lindsay
wrote
to
mason
that
he
had
daily
been
journeying
to
town
with
the
old
chief
baron
and
was
confident
the
government
would
again
be
defeated
in
which
case
it
would
be
very
open
to
attack
for
the
seizure
of
the
rams
also
nevertheless
he
was
emphatic
in
his
caution
to
mason
not
to
place
too
high
a
hope
on
any
change
in
government
policy

on
any
expectation
that

the
southern
independence
association
northern
friends
in
england
were
early
active
in
organizing
public
meetings
and
after
the
second
emancipation
proclamation
of
january
these
became
both
numerous
and
notable
southern
friends
confident
in
the
ultimate
success
of
the
confederacy
and
equally
confident
that
they
had
with
them
the
great
bulk
of
opinion
in
england
at
first
thought
it
unnecessary
to
be
active
in
public
expressions
aside
from
such
as
were
made
through
the
newspapers
up
to
november
records
no
southern
public
meeting
but
by
the
summer
of
the
indefatigable
spence
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
something
must
be
done
to
offset
the
efforts
of
bright
and
others
especially
in
the
manufacturing
districts
where
a
strong
northern
sympathy
had
been
created
on
june
he
wrote
to
mason
that
on
his
initiative
a
southern
club
had
been
organized
in
manchester
and
that
others
were
now
forming
in
oldham
blackburn
and
stockport
in
manchester
the
club
members
had
smashed
up
the
last
abolitionist
meeting
in
the
free
trade
hall
these
parties
are
not
the
rich
spinners
but
young
men
of
energy
with
a
taste
for
agitation
but
little
money
it
appears
to
my
judgment
that
it
would
be
wise
not
to
stint
money
in
aiding
this
effort
to
expose
cant
and
diffuse
the
truth
manchester
is
naturally
the
centre
of
such
a
move
and
you
will
see
there
are
here
the
germs
of
important
work
but
they
need
to
be
tended
and
fostered
i
have
supplied
a
good
deal
of
money
individually
but
i
see
room
for
the
use
of
or
a
month
or
more
the
appeal
for
funds
though
spence
wrote
that
he
would
advance
the
required
amounts
on
the
chance
of
reimbursement
from
the
confederate
secret
service
fund
is
interesting
in
comparison
with
the
contributions
willingly
made
by
bright
friends
young
men
of
energy
with
a
taste
for
agitation
but
little
money
reveals
a
source
of
support
somewhat
dubious
in
persistent
zeal
and
requiring
more
than
a
heavy
list
of
patrons
names
to
keep
up
a
public
interest
nevertheless
spence
succeeded
for
a
short
time
in
arousing
a
show
of
energy
november
mason
wrote
to
mann
that
measures
were
in
progress
and
in

execution
to
hold
public
meetings
memorialize

and
form
an
association
for
the
promotion

efforts
and
postulated
that
in
them
leading
to
european
intervention
lay
the
principal
if
not
the
only
hope
of
southern
independence
a
view
never
acknowledged
by
any
devoted
friend
of
the
south
the
news
is
gloomy
very
and
i
really
do
not
see
how
the
war
is
to
be
worked
out
to
success
without
the
action
of
europe
that
is
stopped
by
our
government
but
there
is
a
power
that
will
move
the
latter
if
it
can
only
be
stirred
up
and
that
of
course
is
public
opinion
i
had
a
most
agreeable
and
successful
visit
to
glasgow
upon
a
requisition
signed
by
the
citizens
the
enemy
placarded
the
walls
and
brought
all
their
forces
to
the
meeting
in
which
out
of
i
think
they
were
fully
strong
but
we
beat
them
completely
carrying
a
resolution
which
embraced
a
memorial
to
lord
palmerston
we
have
now
carried
six

latter
liverpool
manchester
london
as
we
come
upon
the
assembling

by
dint

perseverance
i
think
we
shall
succeed
the
problem
is
simply
to
convert
latent
into
active
sympathy
there
is
ample
power
on
our
side
to
move
the
cabinet
divided
as
it
is
if
we
can
only
arouse
that
power
at

the
object
is
worth

energy
being
called

the
commencement
of

session
will
see
parliament
flooded
with
petitions
from
every
town
and
from
every
mill
throughout
the
north
a
loud
protest
will
arise
against
the
policy
which
declines
to
interfere
while
men
of
english
blood
are
uselessly
murdering
each
other
by
thousands
and
while
england
most
important
manufacture
is
thereby
ruined
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
voice
of
the
north
will
have
any
effect
upon
the
policy
of
the
government
by
the
north
was
meant
the
manufacturing
districts
and
an
explanation
was
made
of
the
difficulty
of
similar
efforts
in
london
because
it
was
really
a
congeries
of
cities
with
no
such
solidarity
of
interests
as
characterized
the
north
without
london
however
the
movement
lacked
driving
force
and
it
was
determined
to
create
there
an
association
which
should
become
the
of
further
activities
spence
beresford
hope
and
lord
eustace
cecil
were
made
a
committee
to
draft
a
plan
and
preliminary
address
funds
were
now
forthcoming
from
the
big
firms
some
time
ago
i
saw
friend
collie
who
had
made
a
terrific
sum
of
money
and
told
him
he
must
come
out
for
the
cause
in
proportion
thereto
to
this
he
responded
like
a
brick
i
was
near
saying
but
i
mean
briton
by
offering
at
once
to
devote
a
percentage
of
cotton
out
of
each
steamer
that
runs
the
blockade
to
the
good
of
the
cause
he
has
given
me
at
once
on
account
of
this
which
i
got
in
a
cheque
and
have
sent
on
to
lord
eustace
cecil
our
treasurer
thus
you
see
we
are
fairly
afloat
there
yet
spence
was
fighting
against
fear
that
all
this
agitation
was
too
late
nevertheless
it
is
not
to
be
disguised
that
the
evil
tidings
make
uphill
work
of
it
very
public
opinion
has
quite
veered
round
to
the
belief
that
the
south
will
be
exhausted
the
correspondent
letters
do
great
harm
more
especially
gallenga
who
replaced
chas
mackay
at
new
york
i
have
however
taken
a
berth
for
mackay
by
saturday
boat
so
he
will
soon
be
out
again
and
he
is
dead
for
our
side
again
spence
asserted
the
one
great
hope
to
be
in
european
intervention
i
am
now
clear
in
my
own
mind
that
unless
we
get
europe
to
move
or
some
improbable
convulsion
occur
in
the
north
the
end
will
be
a
sad
one
it
seems
to
me
therefore
impossible
that
too
strenuous
an
effort
can
be
made
to
move
our
government
and
i
can
not
understand
the
southerners
who
say
what
can
you
make
of
it
i
have
known
a
man
brought
back
to
life
two
hours
after
he
seemed
the
efforts
at
first
seemed
hopeless
but
in
case
of
life
or
death
what
effort
should
be
spared
the
manchester
southern
club
was
the
most
active
of
those
organized
by
spence
and
was
the
centre
for
operations
in
the
manufacturing
districts
on
december
a
great
gathering
as
described
by
took
place
there
with
delegates
from
many
of
the
towns
forster
referred
to
this
and
other
meetings
as
spasmodic
and
convulsive
efforts
being
made
by
southern
clubs
to
cause
england
to
interfere
in
american
affairs
but
the
enthusiasm
at
manchester
was
unquestioned
and
plans
were
on
foot
to
bombard
with
petitions
the
queen
palmerston
russell
and
others
in
authority
but
more
especially
the
members
of
parliament
as
a
body
these
petitions
were
in
process
of
being
signed
in
every
town
and
almost
in
every
throughout
the
district
it
was
high
time
for
london
if
it
was
desired
that
she
should
lead
and
these
activities
to
perfect
her
own
club
next
week
wrote
lindsay
on
january
it
would
be
formally
launched
under
the
name
of
the
southern
independence
association
and
would
be
in
working
order
before
the
reassembling
of
parliament
the
organization
of
meetings
by
spence
and
the
formation
of
the
southern
independence
association
were
attempts
to
do
for
the
south
what
bright
and
others
had
done
earlier
and
so
successfully
for
the
north
tardily
the
realization
had
come
that
public
opinion
even
though
but
slightly
represented
in
parliament
was
yet
a
powerful
weapon
with
which
to
influence
the
government
unenfranchised
england
now
received
from
southern
friends
a
degree
of
attention
hitherto
withheld
from
it
by
those
gentry
who
had
been
confident
that
the
goodwill
of
the
bulk
of
their
own
class
was
sufficient
support
to
the
southern
cause
early
in
the
war
one
little
southern
society
had
indeed
been
organized
but
on
so
diffident
a
basis
as
almost
to
escape
notice
this
was
the
confederate
states
aid
which
came
to
the
attention
of
adams
and
his
friends
in
december
through
the
attendance
at
an
early
meeting
of
one
jackson
jefferson
davis
who
reported
the
proceedings
to
george
thompson
the
meeting
was
held
at
devonshire
street
portland
place
was
attended
by
some
fifty
persons
and
was
addressed
by
lempriere
a
beals
evidently
an
unwelcome
guest
interrupted
the
speaker
was
forcibly
ejected
by
a
policeman
and
got
revenge
by
arranging
a
demonstration
against
mason
who
was
present
confronting
him
on
leaving
the
house
with
a
placard
showing
a
negro
in
chains
there
was
no
public
effort
contemplated
in
such
a
meeting
although
funds
were
to
be
solicited
to
aid
the
south
adams
reported
the
association
as
a
sort
of
club
planning
to
hold
regular
wednesday
evening
meetings
of
its
members
the
dues
being
a
shilling
a
week
and
the
rules
providing
for
loss
of
membership
for
nothing
more
is
heard
of
this
association
after
december
possibly
its
puerilities
killed
it
and
in
any
case
it
was
not
intended
to
appeal
to
the
public
but
the
launching
of
the
southern
independence
association
betokened
the
new
policy
of
constructive
effort
in
london
to
match
and
guide
that
already
started
in
the
provinces
a
long
and
carefully
worded
constitution
and
address
depicted
the
heroic
struggles
of
the
confederates
and
the
general
sympathy
of
england
for
their
cause
dwelt
upon
the
governmental
tyranny
corruption
in
high
places
ruthlessness
in
war
untruthfulness
of
speech
and
causeless
animosity
toward
great
britain
of
the
north
and
declared
that
the
interests
of
america
and
of
the
world
would
be
best
served
by
the
independence
of
the
south
the
effect
of
a
full
year
penetration
in
england
of
emancipation
proclamation
is
shown
in
the
necessity
felt
by
the
framers
of
this
constitution
to
meet
that
issue
this
required
delicate
handling
and
was
destined
to
cause
some
the
concluding
section
of
the
constitution
read
the
association
will
also
devote
itself
to
the
cultivation
of
kindly
feelings
between
the
people
of
great
britain
and
of
the
confederate
states
and
it
will
in
particular
steadily
but
kindly
represent
to
the
southern
states
that
recognition
by
europe
must
necessarily
lead
to
a
revision
of
the
system
of
servile
labour
unhappily
bequeathed
to
them
by
england
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
so
as
to
combine
the
gradual
extinction
of
slavery
with
the
preservation
of
property
the
maintenance
of
the
civil
polity
and
the
true
civilization
of
the
negro
race
the
association
was
unquestionably
armed
with
distinguished
guns
of
heavy
calibre
in
its
committee
and
officers
and
its
membership
fee
one
guinea
annually
was
large
enough
to
attract
the
élite
but
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
all
this
equipment
would
be
sent
into
action
as
yet
the
vigour
of
the
movement
was
centred
at
manchester
and
even
there
a
curious
situation
soon
arose
spence
in
various
speeches
was
declaring
that
the
petition
to
parliament
movement
was
spreading
rapidly
at
ashton
he
said
had
agreed
to
memoralize
the
government
but
on
january
mason
jones
a
speaker
in
the
free
trade
hall
at
manchester
asked
why
southern
public
meetings
had
come
to
a
halt
the
southerners
he
declared
had
taken
the
free
trade
hall
in
the
outset
with
that
intention
and
they
were
obliged
to
pay
the
rent
of
the
room
though
they
did
not
use
it
they
knew
that
their
resolutions
would
be
outvoted
and
that
amendments
would
pass
against
them
there
must
have
been
truth
in
the
taunt
for
while
in
nearly
every
issue
throughout
the
middle
of
reports
great
activity
there
it
does
not
give
any
account
of
a
public
meeting
the
reports
were
of
many
applications
for
membership
from
all
quarters
from
persons
of
rank
and
gentlemen
of
standing
in
their
respective
counties
just
here
lay
the
weakness
of
the
southern
independence
association
programme
it
appeal
to
persons
of
rank
and
gentlemen
of
standing
but
by
the
very
fact
of
the
flocking
to
it
of
these
classes
it
precluded
appeal
to
radical
and
england
already
largely
committed
to
the
cause
of
the
north
goldwin
smith
in
his
letter
to
a
whig
member
of
the
southern
independence
association
made
the
point
very
clear
in
this
pamphlet
probably
the
strongest
presentation
of
the
northern
side
and
the
most
severe
castigation
of
southern
sympathizers
that
appeared
throughout
the
whole
war
smith
appealed
to
old
whig
ideas
of
political
liberty
attacked
the
aristocracy
and
the
church
of
england
and
attempted
to
make
the
radicals
of
england
feel
that
the
northern
cause
was
their
cause
printing
the
constitution
and
address
of
the
association
with
the
list
of
signers
he
characterized
the
movement
as
fostered
by
men
of
title
and
family
with
a
good
sprinkling
of
clergymen
and
as
having
for
its
object
the
plunging
of
great
britain
into
war
with
the
north
it
is
significant
in
view
of
mason
jones
taunt
to
the
southern
independence
association
at
manchester
that
from
the
end
of
march
to
august
was
unable
to
report
a
single
southern
public
meeting
the
london
association
having
completed
its
organization
was
content
with
that
act
and
showed
no
life
the
first
move
by
the
association
was
planned
to
be
made
in
connection
with
the
case
when
as
was
expected
the
exchequer
court
should
render
a
decision
against
the
government
right
to
detain
her
on
january
lindsay
wrote
to
mason
that
he
had
arranged
for
the
public
launching
of
the
association
next
week
that
he
had
again
seen
the
chief
baron
who
assured
him
the
court
would
decide
that
the
government
is
entirely
wrong
i
told
him
that
if
the
judgment
was
clear
and
if
the
government
persisted
in
proceeding
further
that
our
association
which
he
was
pleased
to
learn
had
been
formed
would
take
up
the
matter
in
parliament
and
out
of
it
for
if
we
had
no
right
to
seize
these
ships
it
was
most
unjust
that
we
should
detain
them
by
raising
legal
quibbles
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
them
here
till
the
time
arrived
when
the
south
might
not
require
them
i
think
public
opinion
will
go
with
us
on
this
point
for
john
bull
with
all
his
failings
loves
fair
play
it
is
apparent
from
the
language
used
by
lindsay
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
laird
rams
and
other
ships
fully
as
much
as
of
the
and
hoped
much
from
an
attack
on
the
policy
in
detaining
southern
vessels
earl
russell
was
to
be
made
to
bear
the
brunt
of
this
attack
on
the
reassembling
of
parliament
in
an
editorial
adams
was
pictured
as
having
driven
russell
into
a
corner
by
threats
which
would
not
have
been
endured
for
an
hour
by
a
pitt
or
a
canning
the
foreign
secretary
as
invariably
yielding
to
the
acknowledged
mastery
of
the
yankee
minister
adams
pretensions
are
extravagant
his
logic
is
blundering
his
threats
laughable
but
he
has
hit
his
mark
we
can
trace
his
influence
in
the
detention
of
the
and
the
protracted
judicial
proceedings
which
have
arisen
out
of
it
in
the
sudden
raid
upon
the
rams
at
birkenhead
in
the
announced
intention
of
the
government
to
alter
the
foreign
enlistment
act
of
this
country
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
united
states
cabinet
when
one
knows
the
calibre
of
adams
one
feels
inclined
to
marvel
at
his
success
the
astonishment
ceases
when
one
reflects
that
the
british
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
is
earl
russell
but
when
on
february
the
debate
on
the
laird
rams
occurred
the
tory
leaders
upon
whom
lindsay
and
others
depended
to
drive
home
the
meaning
of
the
decision
carefully
avoided
urging
the
government
to
change
its
policy
and
contented
themselves
with
an
effort
very
much
in
line
with
that
initiated
by
to
belittle
russell
as
yielding
to
a
threat
adams
was
even
applauded
by
the
tories
for
his
discretion
and
his
anxiety
to
keep
the
two
countries
out
of
war
the
southern
independence
association
remained
quiescent
very
evidently
someone
presumably
derby
or
disraeli
had
put
a
quietus
on
the
plan
to
make
an
issue
of
the
stoppage
of
southern
russell
reply
to
his
accusers
was
but
a
curt
denial
without
going
into
details
in
itself
testimony
that
he
had
no
fear
of
a
party
attack
on
the
of
stopping
the
ships
he
was
disgusted
with
the
result
of
the
trial
and
in
conversation
with
adams
reflected
upon
the
uncertainty
and
caprice
incident
everywhere
to
the
administration
of
justice
as
between
russell
and
seward
the
waters
formerly
troubled
by
the
stiff
manner
and
tone
of
the
one
statesman
and
the
flamboyance
of
the
other
were
now
unusually
calm
russell
was
less
officious
and
less
eager
to
protest
on
minor
matters
and
seward
was
less
belligerent
in
language
seward
now
radiated
supreme
confidence
in
the
ultimate
victory
of
the
north
he
had
heard
rumours
of
a
movement
to
be
made
in
parliament
for
interposition
to
bring
the
war
to
an
end
by
a
reunion
of
north
and
south
on
a
basis
of
abolition
and
of
a
northern
assumption
of
the
confederate
debts
commenting
on
this
to
lyons
he
merely
remarked
that
the
northern
answer
could
be
put
briefly
as
determination
to
crush
rebellion
by
force
of
arms
and
resentment
of
any
interposition
the
slaves
were
already
free
and
would
not
be
made
the
subject
of
any
bargain
as
to
the
confederate
debt
the
united
states
seward
said
would
never
pay
a
dollar
of
it
that
there
was
public
animosity
to
great
britain
lyons
did
not
deny
and
reported
a
movement
in
congress
for
ending
the
reciprocity
treaty
with
canada
but
on
seward
advice
paid
no
attention
to
this
acknowledging
that
seward
was
very
wise
in
political
manipulation
and
depending
on
his
opposition
to
the
measure
some
alarm
was
indeed
caused
through
a
recurrence
by
seward
to
an
idea
dating
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
of
establishing
ships
off
the
southern
ports
which
should
collect
duties
on
imports
he
told
lyons
that
he
had
sent
a
special
agent
to
adams
to
explain
the
proposal
with
a
view
to
requesting
the
approval
of
great
britain
lyons
urged
that
no
such
request
be
made
as
it
was
sure
to
be
refused
interpreting
the
plan
as
intended
to
secure
a
british
withdrawal
of
belligerent
rights
to
the
south
to
be
followed
by
a
bold
northern
defiance
to
france
if
she
objected
adams
did
discuss
the
project
with
russell
but
easily
agreed
to
postpone
consideration
of
it
and
in
this
seward
quietly
acquiesced
apparently
this
was
less
a
matured
plan
than
a
feeler
put
out
to
sound
british
attitude
and
to
learn
if
possible
whether
the
tie
previously
binding
england
and
france
in
their
joint
policy
toward
america
was
still
strong
certainly
at
this
same
time
seward
was
making
it
plain
to
lyons
that
while
opposed
to
current
congressional
expressions
of
antagonism
to
napoleon
mexican
policy
he
was
himself
in
favour
once
the
civil
war
was
ended
of
helping
the
republican
juarez
drive
the
french
from
mexico
for
nearly
three
years
russell
like
nearly
all
englishmen
had
held
a
firm
belief
that
the
south
could
not
be
conquered
and
that
ultimately
the
north
must
accept
the
bitter
pill
of
southern
independence
now
he
began
to
doubt
yet
still
held
to
the
theory
that
even
if
conquered
the
south
would
never
yield
peaceful
obedience
to
the
federal
government
as
a
reasoning
and
reasonable
statesman
he
wished
that
the
north
could
be
made
to
see
this
it
is
a
pity
he
wrote
to
lyons
the
federals
think
it
worth
their
while
to
go
on
with
the
war
the
obedience
they
are
ever
likely
to
obtain
from
the
south
will
not
be
quiet
or
lasting
and
they
must
spend
much
money
and
blood
to
get
it
if
they
can
obtain
the
right
bank
of
the
mississippi
and
new
orleans
they
might
as
well
leave
to
the
confederates
charleston
and
savannah
this
was
but
private
speculation
with
no
intention
of
urging
it
upon
the
united
states
yet
it
indicated
a
change
in
the
view
held
as
to
the
warlike
of
the
north
similarly
the
long
confident
of
southern
success
and
still
prophesying
it
was
acknowledging
that
the
unholy
northern
dream
of
universal
empire
must
first
have
passed
throughout
these
spring
months
of
lyons
continued
to
dwell
upon
the
now
thoroughly
developed
readiness
of
the
united
states
for
a
foreign
war
and
urged
the
sending
of
a
military
expert
to
report
on
american
preparations
he
was
disturbed
by
the
arrogance
manifested
by
various
members
of
lincoln
cabinet
especially
by
welles
secretary
of
the
navy
with
whom
seward
so
lyons
wrote
often
had
difficulty
in
demonstrating
the
unfortunate
diplomatic
bearing
of
the
acts
of
naval
officers
seward
was
as
anxious
as
was
lyons
to
avoid
irritating
incidents
but
he
is
not
as
much
listened
to
as
he
ought
to
be
by
his
colleagues
in
the
war
and
navy
departments
such
an
act
by
a
naval
officer
defiant
of
british
authority
and
disregardful
of
her
law
occurred
in
connection
with
a
matter
already
attracting
the
attention
of
the
british
public
and
causing
some
anxiety
to
russell
the
alleged
securing
in
ireland
of
enlistments
for
the
northern
forces
the
war
in
america
had
taken
from
the
ranks
of
industry
in
the
north
great
numbers
of
men
and
at
the
same
time
had
created
an
increased
demand
for
labour
but
the
war
had
also
abruptly
checked
in
large
part
that
emigration
from
europe
which
since
the
middle
had
been
counted
upon
as
a
regular
source
of
labour
supply
easily
absorbed
in
the
steady
growth
of
productive
enterprise
a
few
northern
emissaries
of
the
government
early
sent
abroad
to
revive
immigration
were
soon
reinforced
by
private
labour
agents
and
by
the
efforts
of
steamship
companies
this
resulted
in
a
rapid
resumption
of
emigration
in
and
in
several
cases
groups
of
irishmen
signed
contracts
of
such
a
nature
with
agents
that
on
arrival
in
america
they
were
virtually
into
the
army
the
agents
thereby
secured
large
profits
from
the
sums
offered
under
the
bounty
system
of
some
of
the
eastern
states
for
each
recruit
lyons
soon
found
himself
called
upon
to
protest
on
appeal
from
a
few
of
these
hoodwinked
british
citizens
and
seward
did
the
best
he
could
to
secure
redress
though
the
process
was
usually
a
long
one
owing
to
and
also
to
the
resistance
of
army
officers
as
soon
as
the
scheme
of
bounty
profiteers
was
discovered
prompt
steps
were
taken
to
defeat
it
by
the
american
secretary
of
state
but
the
few
cases
occurring
combined
with
the
acknowledged
and
encouraged
agents
of
labour
emigration
from
ireland
gave
ground
for
accusations
in
parliament
that
ireland
was
being
used
against
the
law
as
a
place
of
enlistments
russell
had
early
taken
up
the
matter
with
adams
investigation
had
followed
and
on
it
appearing
that
no
authorized
northern
agent
was
engaged
in
recruiting
in
ireland
the
subject
had
been
dropped
there
could
be
and
was
no
objection
to
encourage
labour
emigration
and
this
was
generally
recognized
as
the
basis
of
the
sudden
increase
of
the
numbers
going
to
america
but
diplomatic
and
public
quiescence
was
disturbed
when
the
united
states
war
vessel
while
in
port
at
queenstown
november
took
on
board
fifteen
irishmen
and
sailed
away
with
them
russell
at
once
received
indirectly
from
mason
who
was
now
in
france
charges
that
these
men
had
been
enlisted
and
in
the
presence
of
the
american
consul
at
queenstown
he
was
prompt
in
investigation
but
before
this
was
well
under
way
the
sailed
into
queenstown
again
and
landed
the
men
she
had
gone
to
a
french
port
and
no
doubt
adams
was
quick
to
give
orders
for
her
return
adams
was
soon
able
to
disprove
the
accusation
against
the
consul
but
it
still
remained
a
question
whether
the
commander
of
the
vessel
was
guilty
of
a
bold
defiance
of
british
neutrality
on
march
the
irishmen
on
trial
at
cork
pleaded
guilty
to
violation
of
the
foreign
enlistment
act
but
the
question
of
the
commander
responsibility
was
permitted
to
drop
on
adams
promise
april
of
further
investigation
the
case
occurred
as
parliament
was
drawing
to
a
close
in
and
at
a
time
when
southern
efforts
were
at
low
ebb
it
was
not
therefore
until
some
months
later
when
a
gentleman
with
a
shady
past
named
patrick
phinney
succeeded
in
evading
british
laws
and
in
carrying
off
to
america
a
group
of
irishmen
who
found
themselves
unwillingly
forced
into
the
northern
army
that
the
two
cases
were
made
the
subject
of
a
southern
and
tory
attack
on
russell
the
accusations
were
sharply
made
that
russell
was
not
sufficiently
active
in
defending
british
law
and
british
honour
but
these
were
rather
individual
accusations
than
concerted
and
do
not
indicate
any
idea
of
making
an
issue
with
the
government
whenever
opportunity
arose
some
inquiry
up
to
july
would
be
made
intended
to
bring
out
the
alleged
timidity
of
russell
policy
towards
the
north
a
method
then
also
being
employed
on
many
other
matters
with
the
evident
intention
of
weakening
the
ministry
for
the
great
tory
attack
now
being
organized
on
the
question
of
danish
policy
in
truth
from
the
beginning
of
america
had
been
pushed
to
one
side
in
public
and
parliamentary
interest
by
the
threatening
danish
question
which
had
long
been
brewing
but
which
did
not
come
into
sharp
prominence
until
march
a
year
earlier
it
had
become
known
that
frederick
vii
of
denmark
in
anticipation
of
a
change
which
under
the
operations
of
the
salic
law
would
come
at
his
death
in
the
constitutional
relations
of
denmark
to
was
preparing
by
a
new
constitutional
act
to
secure
for
his
successor
the
retention
of
these
districts
the
law
was
enacted
on
november
and
frederick
vii
died
two
days
later
his
successor
christian
ix
promptly
declared
his
intention
to
hold
the
duchies
in
spite
of
their
supposed
desire
to
separate
from
denmark
and
to
have
their
own
prince
in
the
german
confederation
the
federal
diet
of
the
confederation
had
early
protested
the
purpose
of
denmark
and
russell
had
at
first
upheld
the
german
arguments
but
had
given
no
pledges
of
support
to
anyone
but
palmerston
on
various
occasions
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
express
in
parliament
his
favour
for
the
danish
cause
and
had
used
incautious
language
even
to
the
point
of
virtually
threatening
british
aid
against
german
ambitions
a
distinct
crisis
was
thus
gradually
created
coming
to
a
head
when
prussia
under
bismarck
guiding
hand
dragging
austria
in
with
her
thrust
the
federal
diet
of
the
confederation
to
one
side
and
assumed
command
of
the
movement
to
wrest
from
denmark
this
occurred
in
february
and
by
this
time
utterances
made
against
the
wish
of
the
majority
of
his
cabinet
colleagues
though
this
was
not
known
had
so
far
aroused
the
british
public
as
to
have
created
a
feeling
widely
voiced
that
great
britain
could
not
sit
idly
by
while
prussia
and
austria
worked
their
will
on
denmark
there
was
excellent
ground
for
a
party
attack
to
unseat
the
ministry
on
the
score
of
a
humiliating
danish
policy
at
one
time
threatening
vigorous
british
action
then
resorting
to
weak
and
unsuccessful
diplomatic
manoeuvres
for
three
months
the
government
laboured
to
bring
about
through
a
european
council
some
solution
that
should
both
save
something
for
denmark
and
save
its
own
prestige
repeatedly
palmerston
in
the
many
parliamentary
debates
on
denmark
broke
loose
from
his
cabinet
colleagues
and
indulged
in
threats
which
could
not
fail
to
give
an
excellent
handle
to
opponents
when
once
it
became
clear
that
the
ministry
had
no
intention
of
coming
in
arms
to
the
defence
of
the
danish
king
from
february
to
june
this
issue
was
to
the
fore
in
its
earlier
stages
it
did
not
appear
to
southern
sympathizers
to
have
any
essential
bearing
on
the
american
question
though
they
were
soon
to
believe
that
in
it
lay
a
great
hope
having
set
the
southern
independence
association
on
its
feet
in
london
and
hoping
much
from
its
planned
activities
lindsay
in
march
was
momentarily
excited
over
rumours
of
some
new
move
by
napoleon
being
undeceived
he
gave
a
ready
ear
to
other
rumours
received
privately
through
delane
of
the
that
an
important
southern
victory
would
soon
be
forthcoming
donoughmore
the
herald
of
this
glad
news
also
wrote
our
political
prospects
here
are
still
very
uncertain
the
conference
on
the
danish
question
will
either
make
or
mar
the
government
if
they
can
patch
up
a
peace
they
will
remain
in
office
if
they
fail
out
they
go
here
was
early
expressed
the
real
hope
of
one
faction
of
extreme
southern
friends
in
the
danish
question
but
lindsay
had
not
yet
made
clear
where
he
stood
on
a
possible
use
of
a
european
situation
to
affect
the
cause
of
the
south
now
as
always
he
was
the
principal
confidant
and
friend
of
mason
in
england
but
he
was
on
ordinary
political
questions
not
in
sympathy
with
tory
principles
or
measures
he
was
soon
disgusted
with
the
apathy
of
the
london
independence
association
and
threatened
to
resign
membership
if
this
organization
started
with
much
trumpeting
of
intended
activity
did
not
come
out
boldly
in
a
public
demand
for
the
recognition
of
the
south
he
had
already
let
it
be
known
that
another
motion
would
be
made
in
parliament
for
mediation
and
recognition
and
was
indignant
that
the
association
did
not
at
once
declare
its
adherence
evidently
there
were
internal
difficulties
lindsay
wrote
mason
that
he
retained
membership
only
to
prevent
a
break
up
of
the
association
and
had
at
last
succeeded
in
securing
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
when
his
proposed
parliamentary
resolution
would
be
considered
the
manchester
association
was
much
more
alert
and
ready
to
support
him
the
question
is
quite
ripe
fresh
and
from
experience
i
find
that
that
agitation
be
started
by
a
debate
in
parliament
no
notice
is
taken
of
lectures
or
speeches
in
the
provinces
before
any
move
was
made
in
parliament
letters
to
the
newspapers
began
anew
to
urge
that
the
ministry
should
be
pressed
to
offer
mediation
in
america
they
met
with
little
favourable
response
the
at
the
very
end
of
lindsay
effort
explained
its
indifference
and
recited
the
situation
of
stating
that
the
question
had
then
been
decided
once
for
all
it
declared
that
great
britain
had
no
moral
right
to
interfere
and
added
that
to
attempt
to
do
so
would
result
in
filling
the
north
with
the
same
spirit
of
patriotism
and
defiance
as
animated
the
invaded
confederates
thus
support
to
lindsay
was
lacking
in
a
quarter
but
his
conferences
with
association
members
had
brought
a
plan
of
modified
action
the
essential
feature
of
which
was
that
the
parliamentary
motion
must
not
be
made
a
one
and
that
the
only
hope
of
the
south
lay
in
the
existing
government
this
was
decidedly
lindsay
own
view
though
it
was
clearly
understood
that
the
opportuneness
of
the
motion
lay
in
ministerial
desire
for
and
need
of
support
in
its
danish
policy
lindsay
expected
to
find
palmerston
more
complaisant
than
formerly
as
regards
american
policy
and
was
not
disappointed
he
wrote
to
mason
on
may
i
received
in
due
course
your
note
of
the
in
a
matter
of
so
much
importance
i
shall
make
no
move
in
the
house
in
regard
to
american
affairs
without
grave
consideration
i
am
therefore
privately
consulting
the
friends
of
the
south
on
this
subject
we
had
a
meeting
of
our
lifeless
association
on
monday
last
and
on
the
same
subject
we
are
to
have
another
meeting
next
monday
but
differences
of
opinion
exist
there
as
well
as
elsewhere
as
to
the
advisability
of
moving
at
present
some
say
others
but
the
news
by
the
will
regulate
to
a
considerable
extent
our
course
of
action
one
thing
is
now
clear
to
me
that
the
motion
must
be
a
party
one
and
that
the
main
point
will
be
to
get
the
government
to
go
with
brings
forward
the
motion
for
as
you
are
aware
i
would
rather
see
the
motion
in
other
hands
than
mine
as
my
views
on
the
american
question
are
so
well
known
as
no
competent
member
however
seems
disposed
to
move
or
rather
to
incur
the
responsibility
i
sent
to
inquire
if
it
would
be
agreeable
to
lord
palmerston
to
see
me
on
american
affairs
and
on
the
subject
of
a
motion
to
be
brought
forward
in
the
house
he
sent
word
that
he
would
be
very
glad
to
see
me
and
i
had
therefore
a
long
meeting
with
him
alone
last
night
the
result
of
which
was
that
if
i
brought
forward
a
motion
somewhat
as
follows
on
the
third
of
june
he
would
likely
be
prepared
accept
though
he
asked
if
i
would
see
him
again
after
the
arrived
the
motion
we
talked
about
was
to
this
the
house
of
commons
deeply
regretting
the
great
loss
of
life
and
the
sufferings
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
the
confederate
states
of
north
america
by
the
continuance
of
the
war
which
has
been
so
long
waged
between
them
trust
that
her
majesty
government
will
avail
itself
of
the
earliest
opportunity
of
mediating
in
conjunction
with
the
other
powers
of
europe
to
bring
about
a
cessation
of
hostilities
lindsay
had
suggested
to
palmerston
that
it
was
desirable
for
mason
to
return
to
england
and
have
a
conference
with
the
premier
to
this
palmerston
gave
a
ready
consent
but
of
course
no
invitation
lindsay
strongly
urged
mason
to
come
over
think
much
good
will
follow
your
meeting
lord
palmerston
it
will
lead
to
other
and
besides
in
other
matters
i
think
if
you
came
here
you
might
prove
of
much
service
to
the
south
meanwhile
the
difference
within
the
southern
independence
association
permitted
the
coming
forward
of
a
minor
london
organization
called
society
for
promoting
the
cessation
of
hostilities
in
a
letter
was
addressed
by
it
to
members
of
parliament
urging
that
the
time
had
come
for
action
street
london
may
sir
the
society
which
has
the
honour
to
present
to
you
the
accompanying
pamphlet
begs
to
state
that
there
now
exists
in
great
britain
and
ireland
a
strong
desire
to
see
steps
taken
by
the
government
of
this
country
in
concert
with
other
powers
to
bring
about
peace
on
a
durable
basis
between
the
belligerents
in
north
america
i
am
directed
by
the
committee
to
express
a
hope
that
you
will
before
the
session
closes
support
a
motion
in
parliament
to
this
effect
and
should
you
desire
to
see
evidence
of
the
feeling
of
a
large
portion
of
the
country
in
this
matter
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
lay
it
before
you
whether
lindsay
vexed
with
the
delays
of
the
association
had
stirred
the
society
to
action
is
not
clear
but
the
date
of
this
letter
following
on
the
day
after
the
interview
with
palmerston
is
suggestive
the
pressure
put
on
mason
to
come
to
london
was
not
at
first
successful
mason
had
become
fixed
in
the
opinion
arrived
at
in
the
previous
fall
that
there
was
no
favour
to
be
expected
from
palmerston
or
russell
and
that
the
only
hope
rested
in
their
overthrow
against
this
idea
lindsay
had
now
taken
definite
ground
moreover
mason
had
been
instructed
to
shake
the
dust
of
england
from
off
his
shoes
with
no
official
authority
to
return
carefully
explaining
this
last
point
to
lindsay
he
declined
to
hold
an
interview
with
palmerston
except
on
the
latter
invitation
or
at
least
suggestion
had
the
suggestion
you
make
of
an
interview
and
conversation
with
lord
palmerston
originated
with
his
lordship
i
might
not
have
felt
myself
prohibited
by
my
instructions
from
at
once
acceding
to
it
but
as
it
has
the
form
only
of
his
assent
to
a
proposition
from
you
i
must
with
all
respect
decline
it
although
no
longer
accredited
by
my
government
as
special
commissioner
to
great
britain
i
am
yet
in
europe
with
full
powers
and
therefore
had
lord
palmerston
expressed
a
desire
to
see
me
as
his
own
act
of
course
unofficially
and
even
without
any
reason
assigned
for
the
interview
i
should
have
had
great
pleasure
in
complying
with
his
request
the
explanation
of
disinclination
to
come
was
lengthy
but
the
last
paragraph
indicated
an
itching
to
be
active
in
london
again
lindsay
renewed
his
urgings
and
was
not
only
hopeful
but
elated
over
the
seeming
success
of
his
overtures
to
the
government
he
had
again
seen
palmerston
and
had
now
pushed
his
proposal
beyond
the
timid
suggestion
of
overtures
when
the
opportune
moment
should
arrive
to
a
definite
suggestion
of
recognition
of
the
confederacy
i
reasoned
on
the
effect
of
recognition
considering
that
the
restoration
of
the
union
which
was
utterly
hopeless
was
the
object
which
the
north
had
in
view
etc
this
reasoning
appeared
to
produce
a
considerable
effect
for
he
appears
now
to
be
very
open
to
conviction
he
again
said
that
in
his
opinion
the
subjugation
of
the
south
could
not
be
effected
by
the
north
and
he
added
that
he
thought
the
people
of
the
north
were
becoming
more
and
more
alive
to
the
fact
every
day
lindsay
next
step
was
to
be
the
securing
of
an
interview
with
russell
and
if
he
was
found
to
be
equally
acquiescent
all
would
be
plain
sailing
now
if
by
strong
reasoning
in
a
quiet
way
and
by
stern
facts
we
can
get
lord
to
my
views
i
think
i
may
say
that
all
difficulty
so
far
as
our
cabinet
is
concerned
at
an
i
hope
to
be
able
to
see
lord
russell
alone
he
used
to
pay
some
little
attention
to
any
opinions
i
ventured
to
express
to
him
and
i
am
without
hope
i
may
add
that
i
was
as
frank
with
lord
palmerston
as
he
has
been
pleased
to
be
with
me
and
i
told
him
at
parting
that
my
present
intention
was
not
to
proceed
with
the
motion
at
least
for
days
or
a
fortnight
unless
he
was
prepared
to
support
me
he
highly
commended
this
course
and
seemed
much
gratified
with
what
i
said
the
fact
is
it
is
clear
to
me
that
motion
will
be
carried
unless
it
is
supported
by
the
government
for
it
is
clear
that
lord
derby
is
resolved
to
leave
the
responsibility
with
the
executive
and
therefore
the
present
state
of
it
would
seriously
injure
the
cause
of
the
south
to
bring
forward
any
motion
which
would
not
be
carried
lindsay
then
urges
mason
to
come
at
once
to
london
now
apart
altogether
from
you
seeing
lord
palmerston
i
must
earnestly
entreat
you
to
come
here
unless
you
are
much
wanted
in
paris
your
visit
here
as
a
private
gentleman
can
do
no
harm
and
at
the
present
moment
be
of
great
service
to
your
palmerston
willingness
to
listen
to
suggestions
of
what
would
have
amounted
to
a
complete
of
british
policy
on
america
his
gratification
that
lindsay
intended
to
postpone
the
parliamentary
motion
his
friendly
courtesy
to
a
man
whom
he
had
but
recently
rebuked
for
a
meddlesome
amateur
diplomacy
can
be
interpreted
in
no
other
light
than
an
evidence
of
a
desire
to
prevent
southern
friends
from
joining
in
the
attack
daily
becoming
more
dangerous
on
the
government
danish
policy
how
much
of
this
lindsay
understood
is
not
clear
on
the
face
of
his
letters
to
mason
he
would
seem
to
have
been
hoodwinked
but
the
more
reasonable
supposition
is
perhaps
that
much
was
hoped
from
the
governmental
necessity
of
not
alienating
supporters
the
danish
situation
was
to
be
used
but
without
an
open
threat
in
addition
the
tone
of
the
public
press
for
some
time
gloomy
over
southern
prospects
was
now
restored
to
the
point
of
confidence
and
in
this
the
was
again
leading
the
society
for
promoting
the
cessation
of
hostilities
in
america
quickly
issued
another
circular
letter
inviting
members
of
parliament
to
join
in
a
deputation
to
call
on
palmerston
to
urge
action
on
the
lines
of
lindsay
first
overture
such
a
deputation
would
represent
more
than
members
and
the
feeling
of
probably
more
than
twenty
millions
of
people
it
should
not
be
a
deputation
of
parties
but
representative
of
all
groups
in
parliament
the
society
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
premier
is
disposed
to
look
favourably
upon
the
attempt
here
contemplated
and
that
the
weight
of
an
influential
deputation
would
strengthen
his
hands
this
proposal
from
the
society
was
now
lagging
behind
lindsay
later
objective
namely
direct
recognition
that
this
was
felt
to
be
unfortunate
is
shown
by
a
letter
from
tremlett
honorary
secretary
of
the
society
to
mason
he
wrote
that
the
independence
finally
stirred
by
lindsay
insistence
had
agreed
to
join
the
society
in
a
representation
to
palmerston
but
had
favoured
some
specific
statement
on
recognition
palmerston
had
sent
word
that
he
favoured
the
society
resolution
but
not
that
of
the
association
and
as
a
result
the
joint
letter
of
the
two
organizations
would
be
on
the
mild
lines
of
lindsay
original
motion
although
this
quite
expresses
the
object
of
our
society
still
i
do
not
think
the
association
ought
to
have
from
its
principles
it
ought
not
to
have
consented
to
ignore
the
question
which
it
was
instituted
to
bring
before
parliament
that
of
the
independence
of
the
confederacy
and
more
than
that
the
ambiguous
ending
of
the
resolution
to
be
submitted
is
not
such
as
i
think
ought
to
be
allowed
you
know
the
resolution
and
therefore
i
need
only
quote
the
obnoxious
words
her
majesty
government
will
avail
itself
of
the
earliest
opportunity
of
mediating
etc
this
is
just
leaving
the
government
where
they
have
been
all
along
they
have
always
professed
to
take
earliest
opportunity
but
of
which
they
are
to
be
the
judges
evidently
there
was
confusion
in
the
ranks
and
disagreement
among
the
leaders
of
southern
friends
adams
always
cool
in
judgment
of
where
lay
the
wind
wrote
to
seward
on
this
same
day
that
lindsay
was
delaying
his
motion
until
the
receipt
of
favourable
news
upon
which
to
spring
it
even
such
news
adams
believed
would
not
alter
british
policy
unless
it
should
depict
the
complete
defeat
and
dispersion
of
northern
forces
the
day
following
the
reported
grant
to
be
meeting
fearful
reverses
in
virginia
and
professed
to
regard
sherman
easy
advance
toward
atlanta
as
but
a
trap
set
for
the
northern
army
in
the
west
but
in
reality
the
gage
of
battle
for
southern
advantage
in
england
was
fixed
upon
a
european
not
an
american
field
mason
understood
this
perfectly
he
had
yielded
to
lindsay
insistence
and
had
come
to
london
there
he
listened
to
lindsay
account
of
the
interview
now
held
with
russell
and
june
reported
it
to
slidell
of
his
intercourse
with
lord
russell
he
reports
in
substance
that
his
lordship
was
unusually
gracious
and
seemed
well
disposed
to
go
into
conversation
lord
russell
agreed
that
the
war
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
was
hopeless
and
that
neither
could
union
be
restored
nor
the
south
brought
under
the
yoke
in
regard
to
lindsay
motion
lord
russell
said
that
he
could
not
it
but
if
brought
up
for
discussion
his
side
would
favourably
of
it
that
is
to
say
they
would
commend
it
if
they
could
not
vote
for
it
this
referred
to
lindsay
original
motion
of
using
the
earliest
opportunity
of
mediation
and
the
pleasant
reception
given
by
russell
scarcely
justified
any
great
hope
of
decided
benefit
for
the
south
it
must
now
have
been
fairly
apparent
to
lindsay
as
it
certainly
was
to
mason
that
all
this
complaisance
by
palmerston
and
russell
was
but
political
manipulation
to
retain
or
to
secure
support
in
the
coming
contest
with
the
tories
the
two
old
statesmen
wise
in
parliamentary
management
were
angling
for
every
doubtful
vote
discussing
with
lindsay
the
prospects
for
governmental
action
mason
now
ventured
to
suggest
that
perhaps
the
best
chances
of
success
lay
with
the
tories
and
found
him
unexpectedly
in
agreement
i
told
lindsay
but
for
his
ear
only
that
hunter
editor
of
the
had
written
to
hotze
about
his
connection
with
disraeli
and
he
said
at
once
that
if
the
latter
took
it
up
in
earnest
it
could
not
be
in
better
hands
and
would
carry
at
the
expense
of
the
ministry
and
that
he
would
most
cheerfully
and
eagerly
yield
him
the
disraeli
accession
as
you
remember
was
contingent
upon
our
success
in
virginia
and
agreeing
entirely
with
lindsay
that
the
movement
could
not
be
in
better
hands
and
as
there
were
but
days
before
his
motion
could
again
come
i
thought
the
better
policy
would
be
for
the
present
that
he
should
be
silent
and
to
await
events
slidell
was
less
sceptical
than
was
mason
but
agreed
that
it
might
best
advantage
the
south
to
be
rid
of
russell
if
russell
can
be
trusted
which
to
me
is
very
doubtful
lindsay
motion
must
succeed
query
how
would
its
being
brought
forward
by
disraeli
affect
russell
action
if
he
can
be
beaten
on
a
fair
issue
it
would
be
better
for
us
perhaps
than
if
it
appeared
to
be
carried
with
his
qualified
assent
but
mason
understood
that
southern
expectation
of
a
change
in
british
policy
toward
america
must
rest
and
even
then
but
doubtfully
on
a
change
of
government
by
june
his
personal
belief
was
that
the
tory
attack
on
the
danish
question
would
be
defeated
and
that
this
would
of
course
postpone
lindsay
projected
motion
on
june
the
danish
conference
had
ended
and
the
prussian
war
with
denmark
was
renewed
there
was
a
general
feeling
of
shame
over
palmerston
bluster
followed
by
a
meek
british
inaction
the
debate
came
on
a
vote
of
censure
july
in
the
course
of
which
derby
characterized
governmental
policy
as
one
of
meddle
and
muddle
the
censure
was
carried
in
the
lords
by
nine
votes
but
was
defeated
in
the
commons
by
a
ministerial
majority
of
eighteen
it
was
the
sharpest
political
crisis
of
palmerston
ministry
during
the
civil
war
every
supporting
vote
was
needed
not
only
had
lindsay
motion
been
postponed
but
the
interview
with
palmerston
for
which
mason
had
come
to
london
had
also
been
deferred
in
view
of
the
parliamentary
crisis
when
finally
held
on
july
it
resolved
itself
into
a
proud
and
emphatic
assertion
by
mason
that
the
south
could
not
be
conquered
that
the
north
was
nearly
ready
to
acknowledge
it
and
that
the
certainty
of
lincoln
defeat
in
the
coming
presidential
election
was
proof
of
this
palmerston
appears
to
have
said
little
at
the
conclusion
i
said
to
him
in
reply
to
his
remark
that
he
was
gratified
in
making
my
acquaintance
that
i
felt
obliged
by
his
invitation
to
the
interview
but
that
the
obligation
would
be
increased
if
i
could
take
with
me
any
expectation
that
the
government
of
her
majesty
was
prepared
to
unite
with
france
in
some
act
expressive
of
their
sense
that
the
war
should
come
to
an
end
he
said
that
perhaps
as
i
was
of
opinion
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand
it
might
be
better
to
wait
until
it
had
arrived
i
told
him
that
my
opinion
was
that
the
crisis
had
passed
at
least
so
far
as
that
the
war
of
invasion
would
end
with
the
campaign
reporting
the
interview
to
slidell
in
much
the
same
language
mason
wrote
my
own
impressions
derived
from
the
whole
interview
are
that
while
is
as
well
satisfied
as
i
am
that
the
separation
of
the
states
is
final
and
the
independence
of
the
south
an
accomplished
fact
the
ministry
fears
to
move
under
the
menaces
of
the
north
slidell
comment
was
bitter
i
am
very
much
obliged
for
your
account
of
your
interview
with
lord
palmerston
it
resulted
very
much
as
i
had
anticipated
excepting
that
his
lordship
appears
to
have
said
even
less
than
i
had
supposed
he
would
however
the
time
has
now
arrived
when
it
is
comparatively
of
very
little
importance
what
queen
or
emperor
may
say
or
think
about
us
a
plague
i
say
on
both
your
houses
slidell
opinion
from
this
time
on
was
indeed
that
the
south
had
nothing
to
expect
from
europe
until
the
north
itself
should
acknowledge
the
independence
of
the
confederacy
july
expressed
much
the
same
view
and
was
equally
bitter
it
quoted
an
item
in
the
of
july
to
the
effect
that
mason
had
secured
an
interview
with
palmerston
and
that
the
meeting
was
satisfactory
to
all
parties
the
withdrawal
of
lindsay
motion
was
it
is
said
the
result
of
that
interview
the
premier
having
given
a
sort
of
implied
promise
to
support
it
at
a
more
opportune
moment
that
is
to
say
when
grant
and
sherman
have
been
defeated
and
the
confederacy
stand
in
no
need
of
recognition
in
the
same
issue
described
a
deputation
of
clergymen
noblemen
members
of
parliament
and
other
distinguished
and
influential
gentlemen
who
had
waited
upon
palmerston
to
urge
mediation
toward
a
cessation
of
hostilities
in
america
thus
at
last
the
joint
project
of
the
southern
independence
association
and
of
the
society
for
promoting
the
cessation
of
hostilities
in
america
had
been
put
in
execution
the
political
storm
had
passed
and
not
before
when
the
deputation
might
have
had
some
influence
but
the
fact
was
that
no
deputation
unless
a
purely
party
one
could
have
been
collected
before
the
conclusion
of
the
danish
crisis
when
finally
assembled
it
had
no
party
complexion
and
the
smiling
readiness
with
which
it
received
palmerston
jocular
reply
indicating
that
britain
safest
policy
was
to
keep
strictly
to
neutrality
is
evidence
that
even
the
deputation
itself
though
harassed
by
lindsay
and
others
into
making
this
demonstration
was
quite
content
to
let
well
enough
alone
not
so
which
sneered
at
the
childishness
of
palmerston
he
proved
incontestably
to
his
visitors
that
though
he
has
been
charged
with
forgetting
the
vigour
of
his
prime
he
can
in
old
age
remember
the
lessons
of
his
childhood
by
telling
them
that
they
who
in
quarrels
interpose
will
often
wipe
a
bloody
nose
laughter
a
quotation
which
in
the
mouth
of
the
prime
minister
of
the
british
empire
and
on
such
an
occasion
must
be
admitted
as
not
altogether
unworthy
of
abraham
lincoln
himself
spence
took
consolation
in
the
fact
that
mason
had
at
last
come
into
personal
contact
with
palmerston
even
now
at
his
great
age
a
charming
contrast
to
that
piece
of
small
human
lord
russell
but
the
whole
incident
of
lindsay
excited
efforts
mason
journey
to
london
and
interview
with
palmerston
and
the
deputation
left
a
bad
taste
in
the
mouth
of
the
more
determined
friends
of
the
south
of
those
who
were
confederates
rather
than
englishmen
they
felt
that
they
had
been
deceived
and
toyed
with
by
the
government
mason
return
to
london
was
formally
approved
at
richmond
but
benjamin
wrote
that
the
argument
for
recognition
advanced
to
palmerston
had
laid
too
much
stress
on
the
of
the
north
all
that
was
wanted
was
recognition
which
was
due
the
south
from
the
mere
facts
of
the
existing
situation
and
recognition
if
accorded
would
have
at
once
ended
the
war
without
intervention
in
any
form
similarly
stated
that
mediation
was
an
english
notion
not
a
southern
one
the
south
merely
desired
justice
that
is
recognition
this
was
a
bold
front
yet
one
not
unwarranted
by
the
military
situation
in
midsummer
of
as
reported
in
the
press
sherman
western
campaign
toward
atlanta
had
but
just
started
and
little
was
known
of
the
strength
of
his
army
or
of
the
powers
of
southern
resistance
this
campaign
was
therefore
regarded
as
of
minor
importance
it
was
on
grant
advance
toward
richmond
that
british
attention
was
fixed
lee
stiff
resistance
the
great
losses
of
the
north
in
battle
after
battle
and
finally
the
settling
down
by
grant
to
besiege
the
southern
lines
at
petersburg
in
late
june
seemed
to
indicate
that
once
again
an
offensive
in
virginia
to
end
the
war
was
doomed
to
that
failure
which
had
marked
the
similar
efforts
of
each
of
the
three
preceding
years
southern
efforts
in
england
to
alter
british
neutrality
practically
ended
with
lindsay
proposed
but
undebated
motion
of
june
but
british
confidence
in
southern
ability
to
defend
herself
indefinitely
a
confidence
somewhat
shattered
at
the
beginning
of
had
renewed
its
strength
by
july
for
the
next
six
months
this

british
confidence
in
the
south
after
three
years
of
great
northern
efforts
to
subdue
the
south
and
of
southern
campaigns
aimed
first
merely
toward
resistance
but
later
involving
offensive
battles
the
civil
war
to
european
eyes
had
reached
a
stalemate
where
neither
side
could
conquer
the
other
to
the
european
neutral
the
situation
was
much
as
in
the
great
war
it
appeared
to
the
american
neutral
in
december
at
the
end
of
two
years
of
fighting
in
both
wars
the
neutral
had
expected
and
had
prophesied
a
short
conflict
in
both
this
had
proved
to
be
false
prophecy
and
with
each
additional
month
of
the
civil
war
there
was
witnessed
an
increase
of
the
forces
employed
and
a
psychological
change
in
the
people
whereby
war
seemed
to
have
become
a
normal
state
of
society
the
american
civil
war
as
regards
continuity
numbers
of
men
steadily
engaged
resources
employed
and
persistence
of
the
combatants
was
the
great
war
to
date
of
all
modern
conflicts
not
only
british
but
nearly
all
foreign
observers
were
of
the
opinion
by
midsummer
of
after
an
apparent
check
to
grant
in
his
campaign
toward
richmond
that
all
america
had
become
engaged
in
a
struggle
from
which
there
was
scant
hope
of
emergence
by
a
decisive
military
victory
there
was
little
knowledge
of
the
steady
decline
of
the
resources
of
the
south
even
though
jefferson
davis
in
a
message
to
the
confederate
congress
in
february
had
spoken
bitterly
of
southern
disorganization
yet
this
belief
in
stalemate
in
essence
still
postulated
an
ultimate
southern
victory
for
the
function
of
the
confederacy
was
after
all
to
until
its
independence
was
recognized
ardent
friends
of
the
north
in
england
both
felt
and
expressed
confidence
in
the
outcome
but
the
general
attitude
of
neutral
england
leaned
rather
to
faith
in
the
powers
of
indefinite
southern
resistance
so
loudly
voiced
by
southern
champions
there
was
now
one
element
in
the
situation
however
that
hampered
these
southern
champions
the
north
was
at
last
fully
identified
with
the
cause
of
emancipation
the
south
with
the
perpetuation
of
slavery
by
it
was
felt
to
be
impossible
to
remain
silent
on
this
subject
and
even
in
the
original
constitution
and
address
of
the
southern
independence
association
a
clause
was
adopted
expressing
a
hope
for
the
gradual
extinction
of
slavery
this
brought
mason
some
heartburnings
and
he
wrote
to
spence
in
protest
the
latter
reply
being
that
he
also
agreed
that
the
south
ought
not
to
be
offered
gratuitous
advice
on
what
was
purely
an
internal
question
but
that
the
topic
was
full
of
difficulties
and
the
clause
would
have
to
stand
at
least
in
some
modified
form
at
southern
public
meetings
also
there
arose
a
tendency
to
insert
in
resolutions
similar
expressions
in
manchester
spence
wrote
lees
and
the
strongest
man
on
the
board
brought
forward
a
motion
for
an
address
on
this
subject
i
went
up
to
manchester
purposely
to
quash
it
and
i
did
so
effectually
northern
friends
were
quick
to
strike
at
this
weakness
in
southern
armour
they
repeatedly
used
a
phrase
the
foul
blot
and
by
mere
iteration
gave
such
currency
to
it
that
even
in
southern
meetings
it
was
repeated
as
early
as
february
felt
compelled
to
meet
the
phrase
and
in
an
editorial
headed
the
foul
blot
argued
the
error
of
southern
friends
as
long
as
they
could
use
the
word
blot
in
characterization
of
southern
slavery
felt
that
there
could
be
no
effective
british
push
for
southern
independence
and
it
asserted
that
slavery
in
the
sense
in
which
england
understood
it
did
not
exist
in
the
confederacy
it
is
truly
horrible
to
reduce
human
beings
to
the
condition
of
cattle
to
breed
them
to
sell
them
and
otherwise
dispose
of
them
as
cattle
but
is
it
defending
such
practices
to
say
that
the
south
does
none
of
these
things
but
that
on
the
contrary
both
in
theory
and
in
practice
she
treats
the
negro
as
a
with
a
soul
to
be
saved
with
feelings
to
be
respected
though
in
the
social
order
in
a
subordinate
place
and
of
an
intellectual
organization
which
requires
guardianship
with
mutual
duties
and
obligations
this
system
is
called
slavery
because
it
developed
itself
out
of
an
older
and
very
different
one
of
that
name
but
for
this
the
south
is
not
to
blame
but
of
this
the
friends
of
the
south
may
be
assured
that
so
long
as
they
make
no
determined
effort
to
relieve
the
southern
character
from
this
false
drapery
they
will
never
gain
for
it
that
respect
that
confidence
in
the
rectitude
of
southern
motives
that
active
sympathy
which
can
alone
evoke
effective
assistance
the
best
assurance
you
can
give
that
the
destinies
of
the
negro
race
are
safe
in
southern
hands
is
not
that
the
south
will
repent
and
reform
but
that
she
has
consistently
and
conscientiously
been
the
friend
and
benefactor
of
that
race
it
is
therefore
always
with
pain
that
we
hear
such
expressions
as
foul
blot
and
similar
ones
fall
from
the
lips
of
earnest
promoters
of
confederate
independence
as
a
concession
they
are
useless
as
a
confession
they
are
untrue
thus
the
southerner
may
retort
as
we
have
seen
that
an
englishman
would
retort
for
his
country
he
might
say
the
south
is
proud
and
of
nothing
more
proud
than
this
not
that
she
has
slaves
but
that
she
has
treated
them
as
slaves
never
were
treated
before
that
she
has
used
power
as
no
nation
ever
used
it
under
similar
circumstances
and
that
she
has
solved
mercifully
and
humanely
a
most
difficult
problem
which
has
elsewhere
defied
solution
save
in
blood
or
he
might
use
the
unspoken
reflection
of
an
honest
southerner
at
hearing
much
said
of
foul
blot
was
indeed
a
dark
and
damnable
blot
that
england
left
us
with
and
it

declared
that
slavery
was
not
an
issue
in

now
its
defence
of
the
domestic
institution
of

repeatedly
made
in
varying
forms

of
the

of
a
controversy
aroused
in
scientific
circles
by
a

before
the
anthropological
society
of
london
james
hunt
was
the
author
and
the
paper
entitled
the
negro
place
in

aroused
the
contempt
of
huxley
who
criticized
it
at
the
meeting
as
unscientific
and
placed
upon
it
the
stigma
of
public
condemnation
the
result
was
a
fine
controversy
among
the
scientists
which
could
only
serve
to
emphasize
the
belief
that
slavery
was
indeed

issue
in

american

that

as
a
check
upon
the
holding
of
public
meetings
and
prevented
the
carrying
out
of
that
intensive
public
campaign
launched
by
spence
and
intended
to
be
fostered
by
the
southern
independence
association
by
the
end
of
june
there
was
almost
a
complete
cessation
of
southern
meetings
not
thereafter
renewed
except
spasmodically
for
a
brief
period
in
the
fall
just
before
the
presidential
election
in
america
northern
meetings
were
continuous
throughout
the
whole
period
of
the
war
but
were
less
frequent
in
than
in
they
were
almost
entirely
of
two
types
those
held
by
societies
and
religious
bodies
and
those
organized
for
or
by
working
men
an
analysis
of
those
recorded
in
the
files
of
and
in
the
reports
sent
by
adams
to
seward
permits
the
following
classification
year
number
character
and
religious
many
persons
took
part
in
these
meetings
as
presiding
officers
or
as
speakers
and
movers
of
resolutions
among
them
those
appearing
with
frequency
were
george

john

newman
bagley
rev
francis
bishop
taylor
william

thomas
bayley
potter
chesson
and
mason
jones
while
held
in
all
parts
of
england
and
scotland
the
great
majority
of
meetings
were
held
in
london
and
in
the
manufacturing
districts
with
manchester
as
a
centre
from
the
first
the
old
orator
of
the
george
thompson
had
been
the
most
active
speaker
and
was
credited
by
all
with
having
given
new
life
to
the
moribund
emancipation
sentiment
of
great
britain
thompson
asserted
that
by
the
end
of
there
was
a
vigilant
active
and
energetic
society
in
almost
every
great
town
or
city
among
the
john
bright
was
without
question
the
most
popular
advocate
of
the
northern
cause
but
there
were
many
others
not
named
in
the
preceding
list
constantly
active
and
effective
forster
in
the
judgment
of
many
was
the
most
influential
friend
of
the
north
in
parliament
but
bright
also
an
influence
in
parliament
rendered
his
chief
service
in
moulding
the
opinion
of
lancashire
and
became
to
american
eyes
their
great
english
champion
a
view
attested
by
the
extraordinary
act
of
president
lincoln
in
pardoning
on
the
appeal
of
bright
and
in
his
honour
a
young
englishman
named
alfred
rubery
who
had
become
involved
in
a
plot
to
send
out
from
the
port
of
san
francisco
a
confederate
privateer
to
prey
on
northern
commerce
this
record
of
the
activities
of
northern
friends
and
organizations
the
relative
subsidence
of
their
efforts
in
the
latter
part
of
thus
indicating
their
confidence
in
northern
victory
the
practical
cessation
of
public
southern
meetings
are
nevertheless
no
proof
that
the
bulk
of
english
opinion
had
greatly
wavered
in
its
faith
in
southern
powers
of
resistance
the
government
it
is
true
was
better
informed
and
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
tread
gently
in
relations
with
the
north
the
more
so
as
there
was
now
being
voiced
by
the
public
in
america
a
sentiment
of
extreme
friendship
for
russia
as
the
true
friend
in
opposition
to
the
unfriendly
neutrality
of
great
britain
and
france
it
was
a
period
of
many
minor
irritations
arising
out
of
the
blockade
inflicted
by
america
on
british
interests
but
to
these
russell
paid
little
attention
except
to
enter
formal
protests
he
wrote
to
lyons
i
do
not
want
to
pick
a
quarrel
out
of
our
many
just
causes
of
complaint
but
it
will
be
as
well
that
lincoln
and
seward
should
see
that
we
are
long
patient
and
do
nothing
to
distract
their
attention
from
the
arduous
task
they
have
so
wantonly
undertaken
lyons
was
equally
desirous
of
avoiding
frictions
in
august
he
thought
that
the
current
of
political
opinion
was
running
against
the
of
lincoln
noting
that
the
northern
papers
were
full
of
expressions
favouring
an
armistice
but
pointed
out
that
neither
the
peace
party
nor
the
advocates
of
an
armistice
ever
talked
of
any
solution
of
the
war
save
on
the
basis
of
hence
lyons
strongly
advised
that
the
quieter
england
and
france
were
just
at
this
moment
the
better
even
the
suggested
armistice
was
not
thought
of
he
stated
as
extending
to
a
relaxation
of
the
blockade
of
military
probabilities
lyons
professed
himself
to
be
no
judge
but
throughout
all
his
letters
there
now
ran
as
for
some
time
previously
a
note
of
warning
as
to
the
great
power
and
high
determination
of
the
north
but
if
the
british
government
was
now
quietly
operating
upon
the
theory
of
an
ultimate
northern
victory
or
at
least
with
the
view
that
the
only
hope
for
the
south
lay
in
a
northern
weariness
of
war
the
leading
british
newspapers
were
still
indulging
in
expressions
of
confidence
in
the
south
while
at
the
same
time
putting
much
faith
in
the
expected
defeat
of
lincoln
at
the
polls
as
always
at
this
period
save
for
the
few
newspapers
avowedly
friendly
to
the
north
and
one
important
daily
professing
strict
neutrality
the
the
bulk
of
the
metropolitan
press
took
its
cue
as
well
as
much
of
its
war
news
from
the
columns
of
the
this
journal
while
early
assuming
a
position
of
belief
in
southern
success
had
yet
given
both
sides
in
the
war
fair
accuracy
in
its
reports
those
of
the
new
york
correspondent
mackay
always
excepted
but
from
june
a
change
came
over
the
it
was
either
itself
deceived
or
was
wilfully
deceiving
its
readers
for
steadily
every
event
for
the
rest
of
the
year
was
coloured
to
create
an
impression
of
the
unlimited
powers
of
southern
resistance
read
in
the
light
of
modern
knowledge
of
the
military
situation
throughout
the
war
the
gave
accurate
reports
for
the
earlier
years
but
became
almost
hysterical
not
to
say
absurd
for
the
last
year
of
the
conflict
early
in
june
grant
was
depicted
as
meeting
reverses
in
virginia
and
as
definitely
checked
while
sherman
in
the
west
was
being
drawn
into
a
trap
in
his
march
toward
atlanta
the
same
ideas
were
repeated
throughout
july
meanwhile
there
had
begun
to
be
printed
a
series
of
letters
from
a
southern
correspondent
at
richmond
who
wrote
in
contempt
of
grant
army
i
am
at
a
loss
to
convey
to
you
the
contemptuous
tone
in
which
the
tried
and
soldiers
of
general
lee
talk
of
the
huddled
rabble
of
black
white
and
victims
there
are
indians
serving
under
the
stars
and
stripes
who
are
at
times
goaded
up
to
the
southern
lines
the
truth
is
that
for
the
first
time
in
modern
warfare
we
are
contemplating
an
army
which
is
at
once
republican
and
undisciplined
at
the
moment
when
such
effusions
could
find
a
place
in
london
leading
paper
the
facts
of
the
situation
were
that
the
south
was
unable
to
prevent
almost
daily
desertions
and
was
wholly
unable
to
spare
soldiers
to
recover
and
punish
the
deserters
but
on
this
the
was
either
ignorant
or
wilfully
silent
it
was
indeed
a
general
british
sentiment
during
the
summer
of
that
the
north
was
losing
its
power
and
determination
in
the
war
even
though
it
was
unquestioned
that
the
earlier
enthusiasm
for
the
had
passed
away
one
element
in
the
influence
of
the
was
its
impartiality
accompanied
by
a
pretentious
assertion
of
superior
information
and
wisdom
that
at
times
irritated
its
contemporaries
but
was
recognized
as
making
this
journal
the
most
powerful
agent
in
england
angry
at
a
editorial
in
february
in
which
mason
had
been
berated
for
a
speech
made
at
the
lord
mayor
banquet
declared
our
contemporary
is
all
things
to
all
men
it
not
only
shouts
with
the
largest
crowd
according
to
the
pickwickian
philosophy
but
with
a
skill
and
daring
that
command
admiration
it
shouts
simultaneously
with
opposite
and
contending
crowds
it
is
everybody
yet
knew
and
frequently
so
stated
that
the
was
at
bottom
john
bright
medium
the
said
there
was
something
bordering
on
the
sublime
in
the
tremendous
audacity
of
the
war
news
supplied
by
the
of
course
its
prophecies
were
in
a
similar
style
none
of
your
doubtful
oracles
there
none
of
your
vaticinations
like
that
which
took
poor
pyrrhus
in
in
short
the
became
for
the
last
year
of
the
war
the
bible
of
their
faith
to
southern
sympathizers
and
was
frequent
in
its
preachments
there
was
one
journal
in
london
which
claimed
to
have
equal
if
not
greater
knowledge
and
authority
in
military
matters
this
was
the
weekly
and
navy
and
its
editor
russell
in
war
correspondent
in
america
of
the
but
recalled
shortly
after
his
famous
letter
on
the
battle
of
bull
run
consistently
maintained
after
the
war
had
ended
that
he
had
always
asserted
the
ultimate
victory
of
the
north
and
was
indeed
so
in
sentiment
that
this
was
the
real
cause
of
his
recall
he
even
claimed
to
have
believed
in
northern
victory
to
the
extent
of
these
protestations
after
the
event
are
not
borne
out
by
the
columns
of
the
for
that
journal
was
not
far
behind
the
in
its
delineation
of
incidents
unfavourable
to
the
north
and
in
its
prophecies
of
northern
disaster
the
had
no
wide
circulation
except
among
those
in
the
service
but
its
owing
to
the
established
reputation
of
russell
and
to
the
specialist
nature
of
the
paper
were
naturally
quite
readily
accepted
and
repeated
in
the
ordinary
press
based
on
a
correct
appreciation
of
man
power
and
resources
the
did
from
time
to
time
proclaim
its
faith
in
northern
victory
but
always
in
such
terms
as
to
render
possible
a
hedge
on
expressed
opinion
and
always
with
the
assertion
that
victory
would
not
result
in
reunion
russell
most
definite
prophecy
was
made
on
july
the
southern
confederacy
like
denmark
is
left
to
fight
by
itself
without
even
a
conference
or
an
armistice
to
aid
it
and
it
will
be
strange
indeed
if
the
heroism
endurance
and
resources
of
its
soldiers
and
citizens
be
not
eventually
dominated
by
the
perseverance
and
superior
means
of
the
northern
states
let
us
repeat
our
profession
of
faith
in
the
matter
we
hold
that
the
union
perished
long
ago
and
that
its
component
parts
can
never
again
be
welded
into
a
confederacy
of
states
with
a
common
executive
army
fleet
and
central
government
not
only
that
the
principle
of
union
itself
among
the
states
is
so
shocked
and
shattered
by
the
war
which
has
arisen
that
the
fissures
in
it
are
likely
to
widen
and
spread
and
to
form
eventually
great
gulfs
separating
the
northern
union
itself
into
smaller
bodies
but
ere
the
north
be
convinced
of
the
futility
of
its
efforts
to
substitute
the
action
of
force
for
that
of
free
will
we
think
it
will
reduce
the
southern
states
to
the
direst
misery
such
occasional
professions
of
faith
accompanied
by
sneers
at
the
confederate
partisanship
of
the
served
to
differentiate
the
from
other
journals
but
when
it
came
to
description
and
estimate
of
specific
campaigns
there
was
little
to
choose
between
them
and
consequently
little
variance
in
the
effect
upon
the
public
thus
a
fortnight
before
his
profession
of
faith
russell
could
comment
editorially
on
sherman
campaign
toward
atlanta
the
next
great
federal
army
on
which
the
hopes
of
the
north
have
so
long
been
fixed
promises
to
become
a
source
of
fearful
anxiety
sherman
if
not
retreating
is
certainly
not
advancing
and
if
the
confederates
can
interfere
seriously
with
his
communications
he
must
fall
back
as
soon
as
he
has
eaten
up
all
the
supplies
of
the
district
all
the
enormous
advantages
possessed
by
the
federals
have
been
nullified
by
want
of
skill
by
the
interference
of
washington
civilians
and
by
the
absence
of
an
animating
homogeneous
spirit
on
the
part
of
their
soldiery
hand
in
hand
with
war
news
adverse
to
the
north
went
comments
on
the
presidential
election
campaign
in
america
with
prophecies
of
defeat
this
was
indeed
but
a
reflection
of
the
american
press
but
the
citations
made
in
british
papers
emphasized
especially
northern
weariness
of
lincoln
despotism
and
inefficiency
thus
first
printed
in
an
extract
from
a
new
york
paper
new
got
frequent
quotation
we
have
been
imposed
upon
long
enough
the
ruin
which
you
have
been
unable
to
accomplish
in
four
years
would
certainly
be
fully
consummated
were
you
to
remain
in
power
four
years
longer
your
military
governors
and
their
override
the
laws
and
the
of
the
armed
heel
rings
forth
as
dearly
now
in
america
as
in
france
or
austria
you
have
encroached
upon
our
liberty
without
securing
victory
and
we
must
have
it
was
clearly
understood
that
northern
military
efforts
would
have
an
important
bearing
on
the
election
the
while
expressing
admiration
for
sherman
boldness
in
the
atlanta
campaign
was
confident
of
his
defeat
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
general
sherman
can
escape
a
still
more
disastrous
fate
than
that
which
threatened
his
predecessor
he
has
advanced
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
his
base
of
operations
over
a
mountainous
country
and
he
has
no
option
but
to
retreat
by
the
same
line
as
he
advanced
this
is
the
first
instance
of
a
federal
general
having
ventured
far
from
water
communications
that
sherman
has
hitherto
done
so
with
success
is
a
proof
of
both
courage
and
ability
but
he
will
need
both
these
qualities
in
a
far
greater
degree
if
he
is
forced
to
retreat
and
russell
in
the
included
grant
in
the
approaching
disaster
the
world
has
never
seen
anything
in
war
so
slow
and
fatuous
as
grant
recent
movements
except
it
be
those
of
sherman
each
is
wriggling
about
like
a
snake
in
the
presence
of
an
ichneumon
they
both
work
round
and
round
now
on
one
flank
and
then
on
the
other
and
on
each
move
meet
the
unwinking
eye
of
the
enemy
ready
for
his
spring
and
bite
in
sheer
despair
grant
and
sherman
must
do
something
at
last
as
to
shelling
will
they
learn
from
history
then
they
will
know
that
they
can
not
shell
an
army
provided
with
as
powerful
artillery
as
their
own
out
of
a
position
the
northerners
have
indeed
lost
the
day
solely
owing
to
the
want
of
average
ability
in
their
leaders
in
the
field
on
the
very
day
when
russell
thus
wrote
in
the
the
city
of
atlanta
had
been
taken
by
sherman
when
the
news
reached
england
the
having
declared
this
impossible
now
asserted
that
it
was
unimportant
believed
that
sherman
could
not
remain
in
possession
and
two
days
later
turned
with
vehemence
to
an
analysis
of
the
political
struggle
as
of
more
vital
influence
the
democrats
it
was
insisted
would
place
peace
paramount
to
union
and
were
sure
to
win
russell
in
the
coolly
ignoring
its
prophecy
of
three
weeks
earlier
now
spoke
as
if
he
had
always
foreseen
the
fall
of
atlanta
general
sherman
has
fully
justified
his
reputation
as
an
able
and
daring
soldier
and
the
final
operations
by
which
he
won
atlanta
are
not
the
least
remarkable
of
the
series
which
carried
him
from
chattanooga
into
the
heart
of
georgia
but
neither
of
these
expert
journals
would
acknowledge
any
benefit
accruing
to
lincoln
from
sherman
success
not
so
however
lyons
who
kept
his
chief
much
better
informed
than
he
would
have
been
if
credulous
of
the
british
press
lyons
who
for
some
time
had
been
increasingly
in
bad
health
had
sought
escape
from
the
summer
heat
of
washington
in
a
visit
to
montreal
he
now
wrote
correctly
interpreting
a
great
change
in
northern
attitude
and
a
renewed
determination
to
persevere
in
the
war
until
reunion
was
secured
lincoln
he
thought
was
likely
to
be
the
reaction
produced
by
the
fall
of
atlanta
may
be
taken
as
an
indication
of
what
the
real
feelings
of
the
people
in
the
northern
states
are
the
vast
majority
of
them
ardently
desire
to
reconquer
the
lost
territory
it
is
only
at
moments
when
they
despair
of
doing
this
that
they
listen
to
plans
for
recovering
the
territory
by
negotiation
the
time
has
not
come
yet
when
any
proposal
to
relinquish
the
territory
can
be
publicly
made
the
slowly
convinced
that
atlanta
would
have
influence
in
the
election
and
as
always
clever
above
its
contemporaries
in
the
delicate
process
of
to
save
its
prestige
arrived
in
october
at
the
point
where
it
could
join
in
prediction
of
lincoln
it
did
so
by
throwing
the
blame
on
the
democratic
platform
adopted
at
the
party
convention
in
chicago
which
so
it
represented
had
cast
away
an
excellent
chance
of
success
by
declaring
for
union
first
and
peace
afterwards
since
the
convention
had
met
in
august
this
was
late
analysis
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
convention
platform
had
called
for
a
cessation
of
bloodshed
and
the
calling
of
a
convention
to
restore
peace
in
substance
for
an
armistice
but
the
now
assumed
temporarily
a
highly
moral
and
disinterested
pose
and
washed
its
hands
of
further
responsibility
lincoln
was
likely
to
be
for
ourselves
we
have
no
particular
reason
to
wish
it
otherwise
we
have
no
very
serious
matter
of
complaint
that
we
are
aware
of
against
the
present
government
of
america
allowance
being
made
for
the
difficulties
of
their
position
they
are
conducting
the
war
with
a
fair
regard
to
the
rights
of
neutral
nations
the
war
has
swept
american
commerce
from
the
sea
and
placed
it
in
great
measure
in
our
hands
we
have
supplied
the
loss
of
the
cotton
which
was
suddenly
withdrawn
from
us
the
returns
of
our
revenue
and
our
trade
are
thoroughly
satisfactory
and
we
have
received
an
equivalent
for
the
markets
closed
to
us
in
america
in
the
vast
impulse
that
has
been
given
towards
the
development
of
the
prosperity
of
india
we
see
a
great
nation
which
has
not
been
in
times
past
sparing
of
its
menaces
and
predictions
of
our
ruin
apparently
resolved
to
execute
without
pause
and
without
remorse
the
most
dreadful
judgments
of
heaven
upon
itself
we
see
the
frantic
patient
tearing
the
bandages
from
his
wounds
and
thrusting
aside
the
hand
that
would
assuage
his
miseries
and
every
day
that
the
war
goes
on
we
see
less
and
less
probability
that
the
great
fabric
of
the
union
will
ever
be
reconstructed
in
its
original
form
and
more
and
more
likelihood
that
the
process
of
disintegration
will
extend
far
beyond
the
present
division
between
north
and
south
were
we
really
animated
by
the
spirit
of
hostility
which
is
always
assumed
to
prevail
among
us
towards
america
we
should
view
the
terrible
spectacle
with
exultation
and
delight
we
should
rejoice
that
the
american
people
untaught
by
past
misfortunes
have
resolved
to
continue
the
war
to
the
end
and
hail
the
probable
continuance
of
the
power
of
lincoln
as
the
event
most
calculated
to
pledge
the
nation
to
a
steady
continuance
in
its
suicidal
policy
but
we
are
persuaded
that
the
people
of
this
country
view
the
prospect
of
another
four
years
of
war
in
america
with
very
different
feelings
they
are
not
able
to
divest
themselves
of
sympathy
for
a
people
of
their
own
blood
and
language
thus
wilfully
rushing
down
the
path
that
leadeth
to
destruction
sherman
capture
of
atlanta
did
indeed
make
certain
that
lincoln
would
again
be
chosen
president
but
the
was
more
slow
to
acknowledge
its
military
importance
first
hinting
and
then
positively
asserting
that
sherman
had
fallen
into
a
trap
from
which
he
would
have
difficulty
in
escaping
the
called
this
blind
partisanship
but
itself
indulged
in
gloomy
prognostications
as
to
the
character
and
results
of
the
presidential
election
regarding
it
as
certain
that
election
day
would
see
the
use
of
force
fraud
and
every
mechanism
known
to
the
most
unscrupulous
political
agitation
we
confess
it
continued
we
are
only
so
far
affected
by
the
struggle
inasmuch
as
it
dishonours
the
name
and
diminishes
its
reputation
for
justice
and
honour
throughout
the
world
again
official
england
was
striking
a
note
far
different
from
that
of
the
press
adams
paid
little
attention
to
newspaper
utterances
but
kept
his
chief
informed
of
opinions
expressed
by
those
responsible
for
and
active
in
determining
governmental
policy
the
autumn
season
for
speeches
by
members
of
parliament
he
reported
was
progressing
with
a
very
evident
unanimity
of
expressions
whether
from
friend
or
foe
that
it
was
inexpedient
to
meddle
in
american
affairs
as
the
presidential
election
in
america
came
nearer
attention
was
diverted
from
military
events
societies
began
to
hold
meetings
urging
their
friends
in
america
to
vote
for
lincoln
writing
from
washington
lyons
as
always
anxious
to
forestall
frictions
on
immaterial
matters
wrote
to
russell
we
must
be
prepared
for
demonstrations
of
a
foreign
by
seward
during
the
next
fortnight
for
electioneering
purposes
possibly
his
illness
made
him
unduly
nervous
for
four
days
later
he
was
relieved
to
be
asked
by
seward
to
postpone
as
much
as
possible
all
business
with
him
until
after
the
election
by
november
lyons
was
so
ill
that
he
asked
for
immediate
leave
and
in
replying
you
will
come
away
at
once
russell
added
that
he
was
entirely
convinced
the
united
states
wished
to
make
no
serious
difficulties
with
great
britain
i
do
not
think
the
government
have
any
towards
us
or
any
fixed
purpose
of
availing
themselves
of
a
tide
of
success
to
add
a
war
with
us
to
their
existing
difficulties
therefore
whatever
their
bluster
and
buncome
may
be
at
times
i
think
they
will
subside
when
the
popular
clamour
is
over
in
early
november
lincoln
was
triumphantly
receiving
electoral
votes
to
cast
for
mcclellan
no
disturbances
such
as
the
had
gloomily
foretold
attended
the
event
and
the
tremendous
majority
gained
by
the
president
somewhat
stunned
the
press
having
prophesied
disorders
the
now
patted
america
on
the
back
for
her
behaviour
but
took
occasion
to
renew
old
professions
of
faith
against
reunion
abraham
lincoln
ii
reigns
in
succession
to
abraham
lincoln
i
the
first
republican
monarch
of
the
federal
states
and
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
we
are
very
glad
of
it
because
the
measure
of
the
man
is
taken
and
known
it
is
most
creditable
to
the
habits
of
the
people
that
the
elections
passed
off
as
they
have
done
lincoln
has
four
long
years
of
strife
before
him
and
as
he
seems
little
inclined
to
change
his
advisers
his
course
of
action
or
his
generals
we
do
not
believe
that
the
termination
of
his
second
period
of
government
will
find
him
president
of
the
united
states
the
was
disinclined
for
once
to
moralize
and
was
cautious
in
comment
ever
since
he
found
himself
firmly
established
in
his
office
and
the
first
effervescence
of
national
feeling
had
begun
to
subside
we
have
had
no
great
reason
to
complain
of
the
conduct
of
lincoln
towards
england
his
tone
has
been
less
exacting
his
language
has
been
less
offensive
and
due
allowance
being
made
for
the
immense
difficulties
of
his
situation
we
could
have
parted
with
lincoln
had
such
been
the
pleasure
of
the
american
people
without
any
vestige
of
or
he
has
done
as
regards
this
country
what
the
necessities
of
his
situation
demanded
from
him
and
he
has
done
no
more
this
was
to
tread
gently
but
more
exactly
and
more
boldly
the
real
reaction
of
the
press
was
indicated
by
cartoon
of
a
phoenix
bearing
the
grim
and
forceful
face
of
lincoln
rising
from
the
ashes
where
lay
the
embers
of
all
that
of
old
time
had
gone
to
make
up
the
of
america
during
the
months
immediately
preceding
lincoln
english
friends
of
the
south
had
largely
remained
inactive
constantly
twitted
that
at
the
chief
stronghold
of
the
independence
manchester
they
did
not
dare
to
hold
a
meeting
in
the
great
free
trade
hall
they
tried
ticket
meetings
in
smaller
halls
but
even
there
met
with
opposition
from
those
who
attended
at
three
other
places
oldham
ashton
and
stockport
efforts
to
break
the
northern
hold
on
the
manufacturing
districts
met
with
little
success
and
even
as
reported
in
the
were
attended
mainly
by
magistrates
clergy
leading
local
gentry
manufacturers
tradesmen
and
cotton
operatives
the
last
named
being
also
evidently
the
last
considered
and
presumably
the
least
represented
the
rev
massie
conducted
follow
up
northern
meetings
wherever
the
southern
friends
ventured
an
appearance
at
one
town
only
oldham
described
by
as
the
most
town
in
lancashire
was
a
meeting
held
at
all
comparable
with
the
great
demonstrations
easily
staged
by
friends
set
for
october
great
efforts
were
made
to
picture
this
meeting
as
an
outburst
of
indignation
from
the
unemployed
summoned
by
handbills
headed
crisis
the
crisis
the
crisis
there
gathered
according
to
correspondent
a
meeting
of
between
and
wretched
paupers
many
of
whom
were
women
with
children
in
their
arms
who
starved
apparently
in
body
and
spirit
as
in
raiment
had
met
together
to
exchange
miseries
and
ask
one
another
what
was
to
be
done
desperate
speeches
were
made
the
people
almost
threatening
violence
but
finally
adopting
a
resolution
now
become
so
hackneyed
as
to
seem
ridiculous
after
a
description
intended
to
portray
the
misery
and
the
revolutionary
character
of
the
meeting
that
in
consequence
of
the
widespread
distress
that
now
prevails
in
the
cotton
districts
by
the
continuance
of
the
war
in
america
this
meeting
is
desirous
that
her
government
should
use
their
influence
together
with
france
and
other
european
powers
to
bring
both
belligerents
together
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
vast
destruction
of
life
and
property
that
is
now
going
on
in
that
unhappy
country
no
doubt
this
spectacular
meeting
was
organized
for
effect
but
in
truth
it
must
have
overshot
the
mark
for
by
october
the
distress
in
lancashire
was
largely
alleviated
and
the
public
knew
it
while
elsewhere
in
the
cotton
districts
the
mass
of
operative
feeling
was
with
the
north
even
in
ireland
petitions
were
being
circulated
for
signature
among
the
working
men
appealing
to
irishmen
in
america
to
stand
by
the
administration
of
lincoln
and
to
enlist
in
the
northern
armies
on
the
ground
of
emancipation
here
indeed
was
the
insuperable
barrier
in
the
fall
of
to
public
support
of
the
south
deny
as
he
might
the
presence
of
the
foul
blot
in
southern
society
hotze
of
could
not
counteract
that
phrase
when
the
confederate
congress
at
richmond
began
in
the
autumn
of
seriously
to
discuss
a
plan
of
transforming
slaves
into
soldiers
putting
guns
in
their
hands
and
thus
replenishing
the
waning
of
southern
armies
hotze
was
hard
put
to
it
to
explain
to
his
english
readers
that
this
was
in
fact
no
evidence
of
lowered
strength
but
rather
a
noble
determination
on
the
part
of
the
south
to
permit
the
negro
to
win
his
freedom
by
bearing
arms
in
defence
of
his
country
this
was
for
a
journal
that
had
long
insisted
upon
the
absolute
incapacity
of
the
black
race
proximity
of
dates
however
permits
another
interpretation
of
hotze
editorial
of
november
and
indeed
of
the
project
of
arming
the
slaves
though
this
early
in
the
spring
of
was
actually
provided
for
by
law
on
november
slidell
mason
and
mann
addressed
to
the
powers
of
europe
a
communication
accompanying
a
confederate
manifesto
of
which
the
blockade
had
long
delayed
transmissal
this
manifesto
set
forth
the
objects
of
the
southern
states
and
flatly
demanded
recognition
they
ask
is
immunity
from
interference
with
their
internal
peace
and
prosperity
and
to
be
left
in
the
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
their
inalienable
rights
of
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
which
their
common
ancestry
declared
to
be
the
equal
heritage
of
all
parties
to
the
social
compact
russell
replied
november
great
britain
has
since
remained
with
the
exception
of
a
short
period
connected
by
friendly
relations
with
both
the
northern
and
the
southern
states
since
the
commencement
of
the
civil
war
which
broke
out
in
her
government
have
continued
to
entertain
sentiments
of
friendship
equally
for
the
north
and
for
the
south
of
the
causes
of
the
rupture
her
majesty
government
have
never
presumed
to
judge
they
deplored
the
commencement
of
this
sanguinary
struggle
and
anxiously
look
forward
to
the
period
of
its
termination
in
the
meantime
they
are
convinced
that
they
best
consult
the
interests
of
peace
and
respect
the
rights
of
all
parties
by
observing
a
strict
and
impartial
neutrality
such
a
neutrality
her
majesty
has
faithfully
maintained
and
will
continue
to
maintain
if
did
indeed
hope
for
results
from
the
manifesto
and
had
sought
to
bolster
the
appeal
by
dilating
on
a
southern
plan
to
let
the
slaves
win
their
freedom
the
answer
of
russell
was
disappointing
yet
at
the
moment
in
spite
of
the
effect
of
lincoln
the
current
of
alleged
expert
military
opinion
was
again
swinging
in
favour
of
the
south
the
scored
russell
answer
portraying
him
as
attempting
to
pose
as
our
mutual
friend
the
difficulty
of
course
was
to
be
polite
to
the
representatives
of
the
confederate
states
without
appearing
rude
to
the
united
states
and
on
the
other
hand
to
acknowledge
the
authority
of
the
united
states
without
affronting
the
dignity
of
the
confederates
between
these
two
pitfalls
lord
russell
oscillates
in
his
letter
and
now
puts
his
foot
a
little
bit
in
the
hole
on
one
side
and
then
in
recovering
himself
gets
a
little
way
into
the
hole
on
the
other
side
in
this
way
he
sways
to
and
fro
for
a
minute
or
two
but
rights
himself
at
last
and
declares
he
has
hitherto
stood
upright
between
the
two
pitfalls
and
he
will
continue
to
do
so
lord
russell
seems
to
be
in
danger
of
forgetting
that
does
not
mean
but
and
that
if
therefore
he
would
maintain
even
in
words
a
strict
neutrality
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
any
demonstrations
of
friendship
to
either
belligerent
this
was
harsh
criticism
evincing
a
partisanship
justifying
the
allegations
of
the
but
wholly
in
line
with
the
opinion
to
which
the
was
now
desperately
clinging
that
grant
had
failed
and
that
sherman
adventuring
on
his
spectacular
march
to
the
sea
from
atlanta
was
courting
annihilation
yet
even
northern
friends
were
appalled
at
sherman
boldness
and
discouraged
by
grant
slowness
the
son
of
the
american
minister
could
write
grant
moves
like
the
iron
wall
in
poe
story
you
expect
something
tremendous
and
it
only
a
step
after
all
the
was
at
least
consistent
in
prophecies
until
the
event
falsified
them
the
less
so
some
six
weeks
after
having
acclaimed
sherman
generalship
in
the
capture
of
atlanta
the
summary
of
the
military
situation
was
that
if
the
winter
sees
grant
still
before
petersburg
and
sherman
unable
to
hold
what
he
has
gained
in
georgia
the
south
may
be
nearer
its
dawning
day
of
independence
than
could
have
been
expected
a
few
weeks
ago
even
though
wilmington
be
captured
and
charleston
be
ground
away
piecemeal
under
a
distant
cannonade
the
position
of
the
democrats
would
urge
them
to
desperate
measures
and
the
wedge
of
discord
will
be
driven
into
the
body
which
now
represents
the
federal
states
of
north
america
but
on
december
russell
again
changed
his
view
and
foretold
with
accuracy
sherman
movements
toward
savannah
not
so
the
privately
very
anxious
as
to
what
sherman
campaign
portended
while
publicly
belittling
it
december
it
was
noted
that
sherman
had
not
been
heard
from
for
weeks
having
left
atlanta
with
men
december
his
objective
was
stated
to
be
savannah
and
while
the
difficulties
to
be
encountered
were
enumerated
no
prophecy
was
indulged
in
but
on
december
sherman
move
was
called
a
desperate
one
forced
by
his
inability
to
retreat
from
atlanta
if
we
turn
to
military
affairs
we
are
informed
that
the
great
feature
of
the
year
is
sherman
expedition
into
georgia
we
are
not
yet
able
to
say
whether
sherman
will
succeed
in
escaping
the
fate
of
burgoyne
but
we
know
that
his
apparent
rashness
is
excused
by
the
fact
that
sherman
was
unable
to
return
on
the
way
by
which
he
came
so
that
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
the
war
according
to
the
president
is
the
wild
and
desperate
effort
of
an
general
to
extricate
himself
from
a
position
which
whatever
effect
it
may
have
had
on
the
election
should
never
on
mere
military
grounds
have
been
occupied
at
all
this
was
followed
up
four
days
later
by
a
long
and
careful
review
of
sherman
whole
western
campaign
concluding
with
the
dictum
that
his
sole
object
now
was
to
escape
to
some
undefended
point
on
the
coast
where
he
could
be
rescued
by
the
northern
navy
the
war
had
taken
a
definite
turn
in
favour
of
the
south
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
that
sherman
would
venture
to
attack
savannah
for
the
escape
or
safety
of
sherman
and
his
army
it
is
essential
he
should
reach
beaufort
or
some
neighbouring
point
on
the
as
rapidly
as
possible
delay
would
be
equivalent
to
ruin
and
he
will
do
nothing
to
create
it
rarely
if
ever
did
the
in
its
now
eager
and
avowed
championship
so
definitely
commit
itself
in
an
effort
to
preserve
british
confidence
in
the
southern
cause
even
friends
of
the
north
were
made
doubtful
by
the
positiveness
of
prediction
indulged
in
by
that
journal
whose
opinions
were
supposed
to
be
based
on
superior
information
their
recourse
was
to
a
renewal
of
deputations
calling
on
the
american
minister
to
express
steady
allegiance
to
the
northern
cause
and
their
relief
was
great
when
the
news
was
received
that
savannah
had
fallen
december
without
a
struggle
the
recorded
the
event
december
but
with
no
comment
save
that
southern
prospects
were
less
rosy
than
had
been
supposed
then
ensued
a
long
silence
for
this
time
there
was
no
possibility
of
that
editorial
wiggling
about
the
circle
from
excuses
for
misinterpretation
to
a
complacent
resumption
of
authoritative
utterance
for
the
editor
delane
and
for
wise
southern
sympathizers
the
fall
of
savannah
was
a
much
harder
blow
than
the
mere
loss
of
prestige
to
the
courage
failed
and
confidence
in
the
south
waned
momentarily
almost
vanished
nearly
two
weeks
passed
before
the
ventured
to
lift
again
the
banner
of
hope
and
even
then
but
the
capture
of
the
city
completes
the
history
of
march
and
stamps
it
as
one
of
the
ablest
certainly
one
of
the
most
singular
military
achievements
of
the
war
the
advantage
gained
for
the
federal
cause
by
the
possession
of
savannah
is
yet
to
be
shown
to
sherman
and
his
army
change
of
base
is
indisputably
a
change
for
the
better
assuming
that
his
position
at
atlanta
was
as
desperate
as
shortness
of
supplies
and
an
interrupted
line
of
retreat
could
make
it
the
command
of
a
point
near
the
and
free
communication
with
the
fleet
is
obviously
an
improvement
at
the
least
the
army
secures
full
means
of
subsistence
and
a
point
from
which
further
operations
may
be
commenced
on
the
other
hand
the
blow
as
far
as
the
confederate
government
is
concerned
is
mitigated
by
the
fact
that
savannah
has
been
little
used
as
a
seaport
since
the
capture
of
fort
pulaski
by
the
federals
at
an
early
stage
of
the
war
but
the
fall
of
the
city
is
a
patent
fact
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
deny
that
it
has
produced
an
impression
unfavourable
to
the
of
the
confederacy
far
more
emphatic
of
ultimate
northern
victory

the
picture
presented
though
in
sarcasm
by
the
new

seems
to
have
undergone

from

it
is

was
still
planning
some
form
of

save
the

here
are
resolved
on

strict

this
was
a
correct

in

of
a
temporary
pause
in
the
operations
of
northern

and
of
renewed
assertions
from

it

was
encountered
here
on
the
sixteenth

the

johnston
in
command

made
a
desperate

without

sherman
was
at

forcing
lee

wished
still
to

come
out

the
rapidity
with
which
southern
resistance
in
arms
crumbled
in
when
once
sherman
and
grant
were
under
way
no
doubt
startled
foreign
observers
but
in
british
opinion
at
least
the
end
had
been
foreseen
from
the
moment
sherman
reached
the
sea
at
savannah
the
desperate
courage
of
the
south
was
admired
but
regarded
as
futile
equally
desperate
and
futile
was
the
last
diplomatic
effort
of
the
confederate
agents
in
europe
taking
the
form
of
an
offer
to
abolish
slavery
in
return
for
recognition
the
plan
originated
with
benjamin
southern
secretary
of
state
was
hesitatingly
approved
by
davis
and
was
committed
to
mason
for
negotiation
with
great
britain
mason
after
his
withdrawal
from
london
had
been
given
duplicate
powers
in
blank
for
any
point
to
which
emergencies
might
send
him
thus
becoming
a
sort
of
confederate
commissioner
at
large
to
europe
less
than
any
other
representative
abroad
inclined
to
admit
that
slavery
was
other
than
a
beneficent
and
humane
institution
it
was
felt
advisable
at
richmond
not
only
to
instruct
mason
by
written
despatch
but
by
personal
messenger
also
of
the
urgency
of
presenting
the
offer
of
abolition
promptly
and
with
full
assurance
of
carrying
it
into
effect
the
instruction
was
therefore
entrusted
to
duncan
kenner
of
louisiana
and
he
arrived
in
paris
early
in
march
overcame
mason
unwillingness
to
carry
such
an
offer
to
england
and
accompanied
the
latter
to
london
the
time
was
certainly
not
propitious
for
on
the
day
mason
reached
london
there
came
the
news
of
the
burning
of
columbia
and
the
evacuation
of
charleston
mason
hesitated
to
approach
palmerston
but
was
pressed
by
kenner
who
urged
action
on
the
theory
that
great
britain
did
not
wish
to
see
a
reconstruction
of
the
union
slidell
in
paris
on
receiving
mason
doubts
advised
waiting
until
the
emperor
had
been
consulted
was
granted
an
interview
and
reported
napoleon
iii
as
ready
as
ever
to
act
if
england
would
act
also
but
as
advising
delay
until
more
favourable
news
was
received
from
america
but
instructions
did
not
permit
delay
he
must
either
carry
them
out
or
resign
and
kenner
was
at
his
elbow
pressing
for
action
on
march
therefore
mason
wrote
to
palmerston
asking
for
a
private
interview
and
was
promptly
granted
one
for
the
day
following
both
personal
disinclination
to
the
proposal
of
abolition
and
judgment
that
nothing
would
come
of
it
made
mason
cautious
in
expressing
himself
to
palmerston
mason
felt
that
he
was
stultifying
his
country
in
condemning
slavery
hence
in
roundabout
language
with
such
form
of
allusion
to
the
we
held
in
reserve
as
would
make
him
necessarily
comprehend
it
and
turning
again
and
again
to
a
supposed
latent
undisclosed
obstacle
to
british
recognition
mason
yet
made
clear
the
object
of
his
visit
the
word
slavery
was
not
mentioned
by
him
but
palmerston
promptly
denied
that
slavery
in
the
south
had
ever
been
or
was
now
a
barrier
to
recognition
british
objections
to
recognition
were
those
which
had
long
since
been
stated
and
there
was
nothing
underlying
them
on
march
mason
called
on
the
earl
of
donoughmore
a
tory
friend
of
the
south
with
whom
he
had
long
been
in
close
touch
and
asked
whether
he
thought
government
could
be
induced
by
a
southern
abolition
of
slavery
to
recognize
the
confederacy
the
reply
was
that
the
time
had
gone
by
now
this
time
the
words
slavery
and
abolition
were
spoken
boldly
and
donoughmore
was
positive
that
if
in
the
midsummer
of
when
lee
was
invading
pennsylvania
the
south
had
made
its
present
overture
nothing
could
have
prevented
british
recognition
the
opinion
clashed
with
mason
own
conviction
but
in
any
case
no
more
was
to
be
hoped
now
from
his
overture
only
a
favourable
turn
in
the
war
could
help
the
south
there
was
no
public
knowledge
in
london
of
this
last
card
southern
effort
in
diplomacy
though
there
were
newspaper
rumours
that
some
such
move
was
on
foot
but
with
a
primary
motive
of
restoring
southern
fighting
power
by
putting
the
negroes
in
arms
british
public
attention
was
fixed
rather
upon
a
possible
reconciliation
of
north
and
south
and
a
restored
union
which
should
forget
its
domestic
troubles
in
a
foreign
war
momentarily
somewhat
of
a
panic
overcame
london
society
and
gloomy
were
the
forebodings
that
great
britain
would
be
the
chosen
enemy
of
america
like
rumours
were
afloat
at
washington
also
the
russian
minister
stoeckl
reported
to
his
government
that
he
had
learned
from
a
sure
source
of
representations
made
to
jefferson
davis
by
blair
a
prominent
unionist
and
politician
of
the
border
state
of
maryland
looking
to
reconstruction
and
to
the
sending
by
lincoln
of
armies
into
canada
and
mexico
stoeckl
believed
such
a
war
would
be
popular
but
commented
that
lincoln
might
change
his
mind
in
london
the
and
navy
declared
that
davis
could
not
consent
to
reunion
and
that
lincoln
could
not
offer
any
other
terms
of
peace
but
that
a
truce
might
be
patched
up
on
the
basis
of
a
common
aggression
against
supposed
foreign
enemies
adams
pictured
all
british
society
as
now
convinced
that
the
end
of
the
war
was
near
and
bitter
against
the
previous
tone
and
policy
of
such
leaders
of
public
opinion
as
the
adding
that
it
was
being
whispered
about
that
if
the
feud
is
reconciled
and
the
union
restored
and
a
great
army
left
on
our
hands
the
next
manifestation
will
be
one
of
hostility
to
this
country
the
basis
of
all
this
rumour
was
blair
attempt
to
play
the
mediator
he
so
far
succeeded
that
on
january
lincoln
instructed
seward
to
go
to
fortress
monroe
to
meet
commissioners
appointed
by
davis
but
lincoln
made
positive
in
his
instructions
three
points
complete
restoration
of
the
union
no
receding
on
emancipation
no
cessation
of
hostilities
short
of
an
end
of
the
war
and
the
disbanding
of
all
forces
hostile
to
the
government
a
few
days
later
the
president
decided
that
his
own
presence
was
desirable
and
joined
his
secretary
of
state
in
the
hampton
roads
conference
of
february
it
quickly
appeared
that
the
confederates
did
indeed
hope
to
draw
the
north
into
a
foreign
war
for
a
traditional
american
object
using
the
argument
that
such
a
war
restoration
of
the
union
would
be
easily
accomplished
the
enemy
proposed
was
not
great
britain
but
france
and
the
place
of
operations
mexico
there
was
much
discussion
of
this
plan
between
seward
and
stephens
the
leading
southern
commissioner
but
lincoln
merely
listened
and
when
pressed
for
comment
stuck
fast
to
his
decision
that
no
agreement
whatever
would
be
entered
into
until
the
south
had
laid
down
its
arms
the
southerners
urged
that
there
was
precedent
for
an
agreement
in
advance
of
cessation
of
hostilities
in
the
negotiations
between
charles
i
and
the
roundheads
lincoln
reply
was
pithy
i
do
not
profess
to
be
posted
in
history
on
all
such
matters
i
turn
you
over
to
seward
all
i
distinctly
recollect
about
the
case
of
charles
i
is
that
he
lost
his
head
in
the
end
when
news
of
the
holding
of
this
conference
reached
england
there
occurred
a
panic
on
the
stock
exchange
due
to
the
uncertainty
created
by
the
prospect
of
an
immediate
end
of
the
american
war
the
consternation
wrote
adams
was
extraordinary
what
did
the
united
states
intend
to
do
the
impression
is
now
very
general
that
peace
and
restoration
at
home
are
synonymous
with
war
with
this
country
there
existed
an
extraordinary
uneasiness
and
indefinite
apprehension
as
to
the
future
so
reported
adams
to
seward
and
he
advised
that
it
might
be
well
for
the
united
states
to
consider
the
question
how
far
its
policy
may
be
adapted
to
quiet
this
disturbance
due
allowance
should
be
made
for
the
mortification
of
those
leaders
who
had
been
so
confident
of
southern
victory
and
for
expressions
that
might
now
fall
from
their
lips
it
was
possible
that
reassurances
given
by
the
united
states
might
aid
in
the
coming
elections
in
retaining
the
government
in
power
evidently
in
adams
opinion
a
result
to
be
desired
adams
advice
as
to
the
forthcoming
elections
was
but
repetition
of
that
given
earlier
and
with
more
emphasis
apparently
seward
was
then
in
no
mood
to
act
on
it
for
his
reply
was
distinctly
belligerent
in
tone
recapitulating
british
and
canadian
offences
in
permitting
the
enemy
to
use
their
shores
and
asserting
that
the
measures
now
proposed
of
abrogating
the
reciprocity
treaty
of
with
canada
and
the
agreement
of
prohibiting
armaments
on
the
great
lakes
were
but
defensive
measures
required
to
protect
american
soil
these
matters
adams
had
been
instructed
to
take
up
with
russell
but
with
discretion
as
to
time
and
he
had
ventured
to
postpone
them
as
inopportune
professing
entire
agreement
with
the
justice
of
complaints
he
nevertheless
wrote
that
to
press
them
at
this
moment
would
be
only
playing
into
the
hands
of
the
and
disarming
our
own
friends
the
day
before
this
was
written
home
seward
at
washington
on
march
recalled
his
instruction
as
to
the
agreement
of
stating
that
russell
might
be
informed
the
united
states
had
no
intention
of
increasing
its
armaments
on
the
great
lakes
thus
there
were
incidents
offering
ground
for
a
british
excitement
over
a
prospective
war
with
america
even
though
no
such
intention
was
seriously
entertained
by
the
north
the
british
government
did
not
share
this
fear
but
delane
of
the
kept
it
alive
in
the
public
mind
and
indeed
was
sincere
in
efforts
to
arouse
his
readers
to
the
danger
i
do
not
know
what
grounds
delane
has
for
it
wrote
russell
to
his
american
friend
bigelow
but
he
is
quite
sure
uncle
samuel
is
about
to
finish
off
the
dreadful
civil
war
with
another
war
with
us
scarcely
less
horrible
governmental
circles
however
belittled
the
agitation
burnley
temporarily
representing
england
at
washington
was
assured
by
seward
and
so
reported
that
all
these
rumours
of
a
foreign
war
were
of
southern
origin
had
in
fact
been
actually
elaborated
at
the
hampton
roads
conference
but
were
perfectly
understood
by
the
north
as
but
part
of
the
southern
game
and
that
the
southern
offer
had
been
flatly
refused
in
a
parliamentary
debate
in
the
commons
on
march
arising
out
of
governmental
estimates
for
military
expenditures
in
canada
opportunity
was
given
for
a
discussion
of
relations
with
america
a
few
members
gave
voice
to
the
fear
of
war
but
the
general
tone
of
the
debate
was
one
of
confidence
in
the
continuance
of
peaceful
relations
bright
in
a
vigorous
and
witty
speech
threw
right
and
left
criticisms
of
parliament
the
press
and
individuals
not
sparing
members
of
the
government
but
expressed
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
pacific
policy
of
lincoln
as
one
known
to
be
in
close
touch
with
america
his
words
carried
weight
palmerston
gave
assurances
that
the
present
relations
between
the
two
governments
were
perfectly
friendly
and
satisfactory
the
effect
of
the
debate
reported
adams
was
to
quiet
the
panic
yet
at
the
same
time
england
was
now
awake
to
and
somewhat
alarmed
by
america
prodigious
development
of
physical
power
during
the
war
to
quiet
this
adams
recommended
prudence
and
moderation
in
tone
thus
the
actual
cessation
of
hostilities
in
america
and
the
possible
effect
of
this
event
on
foreign
relations
had
been
for
some
time
anticipated
and
estimated
in
great
britain
the
news
of
surrender
therefore
caused
no
great
surprise
since
the
and
other
papers
had
been
preparing
the
public
for
it
newspaper
comment
on
the
event
followed
closely
that
of
the
rendering
honour
to
the
militant
qualities
of
the
south
and
to
lee
but
writing
to
the
war
such
is
the
end
of
the
great
army
which
organized
by
the
extraordinary
genius
of
one
man
aided
by
several
other
commanders
of
eminent
ability
has
done
such
wonders
in
this
war
not
even
the
grand
army
of
napoleon
himself
could
count
a
series
of
more
brilliant
victories
than
the
force
which
raised
chiefly
from
the
population
of
virginia
has
defeated
so
many
invasions
of
the
state
and
crushed
the
hopes
of
so
many
northern
generals
chief
and
soldiers
have
now
failed
for
the
first
and
last
time
they
were
victorious
until
victory
was
no
longer
to
be
achieved
by
human
valour
and
then
they
fell
with
honour
the
people
of
the
north
also
were
complimented
for
their
slowly
developed
but
ultimate
ability
in
war
and
especially
for
a
patience
a
fortitude
and
an
energy
which
entitle
them
to
rank
among
the
very
first
of
military
nations
no
one
remained
to
uphold
the
southern
banner
in
europe
save
the
confederate
agents
and
privately
even
they
were
hopeless
mason
it
is
true
asserted
as
if
bolstering
his
own
courage
that
this
morning
news
did
not
mean
an
overwhelming
disaster
it
could
not
be
wholly
true
even
if
true
it
must
mean
peace
on
the
basis
of
separation
finally
that
no
terms
of
peace
would
be
accepted
that
did
not
embrace
independence
but
at
the
conclusion
of
this
letter
he
acknowledged
i
confess
that
all
this
speculation
rests
on
what
i
assume
that
lee
surrendered
only
in
expectation
of
a
peace
derived
from
his
interview
with
grant
and
that
no
terms
of
peace
would
be
entertained
that
did
not
rest
on
but
slidell
saw
more
clearly
he
replied
i
can
not
share
your
hopefulness
we
have
seen
the
beginning
of
the
end
i
for
my
part
am
prepared
for
the
worst
with
lee
surrender
there
will
soon
be
an
end
to
our
regular
organized
armies
and
i
can
see
no
possible
good
to
result
from
a
protracted
guerilla
warfare
we
are
crushed
and
must
submit
to
the
yoke
our
children
must
bide
their
time
for
vengeance
but
you
and
i
will
never
revisit
our
homes
under
our
glorious
flag
for
myself
i
shall
never
put
my
foot
on
a
soil
from
which
flaunts
the
hated
stars
and
stripes
i
am
sick
sick
at
heart
the
news
of
lee
surrender
arrived
at
the
same
moment
with
that
of
a
serious
injury
to
seward
in
a
runaway
accident
and
in
its
editorial
on
the
end
of
the
war
the
took
occasion
to
pay
a
tribute
to
the
statesman
whom
it
had
been
accustomed
to
berate
there
seems
to
be
on
the
part
of
president
lincoln
a
desire
to
conciliate
vanquished
under
the
guidance
of
seward
who
has
creditably
distinguished
himself
in
the
cabinet
by
his
moderate
counsels
and
whose
life
will
we
trust
be
spared
at
this
crisis
to
the
union
he
may
by
gentle
measures
restore
tranquillity
and
perhaps
before
his
term
of
office
expires
calm
in
some
degree
the
animosities
which
have
been
raised
by
these
years
of
war
nor
was
this
insincere
for
seward
had
first
in
the
estimate
of
british
statesmen
more
slowly
in
the
press
and
with
the
public
come
to
be
regarded
in
an
aspect
far
different
from
that
with
which
he
was
generally
viewed
in
there
was
real
anxiety
at
the
reports
of
seward
accident
but
when
in
less
than
a
week
there
was
received
also
the
news
of
the
assassination
of
lincoln
and
of
the
brutal
attack
on
seward
all
england
united
in
expressions
of
sympathy
and
horror
few
events
of
the
present
century
wrote
adams
have
created
such
general
consternation
and
indignation
in
ford
theatre
on
the
evening
of
april
lincoln
was
shot
by
booth
a
fanatical
southerner
who
had
gained
entrance
to
the
box
where
the
president
was
sitting
lincoln
died
early
the
next
morning
on
the
same
evening
at
about
ten
an
unknown
man
was
admitted
to
house
on
the
plea
that
he
had
a
message
from
the
physician
passed
upstairs
but
was
stopped
by
seward
son
at
the
door
of
the
sick
room
beating
the
son
into
with
a
revolver
which
had
missed
fire
the
stranger
burst
open
the
door
attacked
the
secretary
as
he
lay
in
bed
with
a
slashing
at
his
throat
until
seward
rolled
off
the
bed
to
the
floor
seward
throat
was
cut
on
both
sides
his
right
cheek
nearly
severed
from
his
face
his
life
was
saved
probably
because
of
an
iron
frame
worn
to
support
the
jaw
fractured
in
the
runaway
accident
nine
days
before
the
assailant
fought
his
way
out
of
the
house
and
escaped
for
some
days
seward
life
was
despaired
of
whether
from
his
injuries
or
from
shock
these
tragic
occurrences
were
the
outcome
of
a
revengeful
spirit
in
the
hearts
of
a
few
extreme
southerners
and
in
no
sense
represented
the
feeling
of
the
south
it
was
inevitable
however
that
abroad
so
horrible
a
crime
should
react
both
to
the
detriment
of
the
confederacy
and
to
the
advantage
of
the
north
sympathy
with
the
north
took
the
form
of
a
sudden
exaltation
of
the
personality
of
lincoln
bringing
out
characterizations
of
the
man
far
different
from
those
which
had
been
his
earlier
in
the
war
the
presence
of
a
rural
attorney
in
the
presidential
office
had
seemed
like
the
irony
of
fate
in
the
great
crisis
of
even
so
acute
an
observer
as
lyons
could
then
write
lincoln
has
not
hitherto
given
proof
of
his
possessing
any
natural
talents
to
compensate
for
his
ignorance
of
everything
but
illinois
village
politics
he
seems
to
be
well
meaning
and
conscientious
in
the
measure
of
his
understanding
but
not
much
more
but
lyons
was
no
more
blind
than
his
contemporaries
for
nearly
all
characterizations
whether
american
or
foreign
were
of
like
nature
but
the
slow
progress
of
the
years
of
war
had
brought
a
different
estimate
of
lincoln
a
curious
blending
of
admiration
for
the
growth
of
his
personal
authority
and
for
his
steadiness
of
purpose
with
criticism
of
his
alleged
despotism
now
with
his
death
following
so
closely
the
collapse
of
the
confederacy
there
poured
out
from
british
press
and
public
a
great
stream
of
laudation
for
lincoln
almost
amounting
to
a
national
recantation
in
this
process
of
whitening
abraham
tomb
as
a
few
southern
sympathizers
called
it
led
the
way
in
a
poem
by
tom
taylor
lay
a
wreath
on
murdered
lincoln
bier
who
with
mocking
pencil
wont
to
trace
broad
for
the
british
sneer
his
length
of
shambling
limb
his
furrowed
face
yes
he
had
lived
to
shame
me
from
my
sneer
to
lame
my
pencil
and
confute
my
pen
to
make
me
own
this
hind
of
princes
peer
this
a
king
of
men
less
emotional
than
most
papers
but
with
a
truer
estimate
of
lincoln
stood
the
severely
reprobating
the
act
of
booth
and
prophesying
a
disastrous
effect
in
the
treatment
of
the
conquered
south
it
proceeded
starting
from
a
humble
position
to
one
of
the
greatest
eminence
and
adopted
by
the
republican
party
as
a
simply
because
seward
and
their
other
prominent
leaders
were
obnoxious
to
different
sections
of
the
party
it
was
natural
that
his
career
should
be
watched
with
jealous
suspicion
the
office
cast
upon
him
was
great
its
duties
most
onerous
and
the
obscurity
of
his
past
career
afforded
no
guarantee
of
his
ability
to
discharge
them
his
shortcomings
moreover
were
on
the
surface
the
education
of
a
man
whose
early
years
had
been
spent
in
earning
bread
by
manual
labour
had
necessarily
been
defective
and
faults
of
manner
and
errors
of
taste
repelled
the
observer
at
the
outset
in
spite
of
these
drawbacks
lincoln
slowly
won
for
himself
the
respect
and
confidence
of
all
his
perfect
honesty
speedily
became
apparent
and
what
is
perhaps
more
to
his
credit
amid
the
many
unstudied
speeches
which
he
was
called
upon
from
time
to
time
to
deliver
imbued
though
they
were
with
the
rough
humour
of
his
early
associates
he
was
in
none
of
them
betrayed
into
any
intemperance
of
language
towards
his
opponents
or
towards
neutrals
his
utterances
were
apparently
careless
but
his
tongue
was
always
under
command
the
quality
of
lincoln
administration
which
served
however
more
than
any
other
to
enlist
the
sympathy
of
bystanders
was
its
conservative
progress
he
felt
his
way
gradually
to
his
conclusions
and
those
who
will
compare
the
different
stages
of
his
career
one
with
another
will
find
that
his
mind
was
growing
throughout
the
course
of
it
the
gradual
change
of
his
language
and
of
his
policy
was
most
remarkable
englishmen
learnt
to
respect
a
man
who
showed
the
best
characteristics
of
their
race
in
his
respect
for
what
is
good
in
the
past
acting
in
unison
with
a
recognition
of
what
was
made
necessary
by
the
events
of
passing
history
this
was
first
reaction
two
days
later
commenting
on
the
far
warmer
expressions
of
horror
and
sympathy
emanating
from
all
england
there
appeared
another
and
longer
editorial
if
anything
could
mitigate
the
distress
of
the
american
people
in
their
present
affliction
it
might
surely
be
the
sympathy
which
is
expressed
by
the
people
of
this
country
we
are
not
using
the
language
of
hyperbole
in
describing
the
manifestation
of
feeling
as
unexampled
nothing
like
it
has
been
witnessed
in
our
generation
but
president
lincoln
was
only
the
chief
of
a
foreign
state
and
of
a
state
with
which
we
were
not
infrequently
in
diplomatic
or
political
collision
he
might
have
been
regarded
as
not
much
more
to
us
than
the
head
of
any
friendly
government
and
yet
his
end
has
already
stirred
the
feelings
of
the
public
to
their
uttermost
depths
a
space
of
hours
has
sufficed
not
only
to
fill
the
country
with
grief
and
indignation
but
to
evoke
almost
unprecedented
expressions
of
feeling
from
constituted
bodies
it
was
but
on
wednesday
that
the
intelligence
of
the
murder
reached
us
and
on
thursday
the
houses
of
lords
and
commons
the
corporation
of
the
city
of
london
and
the
people
of
our
chief
manufacturing
towns
in
public
meeting
assembled
had
recorded
their
sentiments
or
expressed
their
views
in
the
house
of
lords
the
absence
of
precedent
for
such
a
manifestation
was
actually
made
the
subject
of
remark
that
much
of
this
extraordinary
feeling
is
due
to
the
tragical
character
of
the
event
and
the
horror
with
which
the
crime
is
regarded
is
doubtless
true
nor
need
we
dissemble
the
the
fact
that
the
loss
which
the
americans
have
sustained
is
also
thought
our
own
loss
in
so
far
as
one
valuable
guarantee
for
the
amity
of
the
two
nations
may
have
been
thus
removed
but
upon
the
whole
it
is
neither
the
possible
embarrassment
of
international
relations
nor
the
infamous
wickedness
of
the
act
itself
which
has
determined
public
feeling
the
preponderating
sentiment
is
sincere
and
genuine
sympathy
sorrow
for
the
chief
of
a
great
people
struck
down
by
an
assassin
and
sympathy
for
that
people
in
the
trouble
which
at
a
crisis
of
their
destinies
such
a
catastrophe
must
bring
abraham
lincoln
was
as
little
of
a
tyrant
as
any
man
who
ever
lived
he
could
have
been
a
tyrant
had
he
pleased
but
he
never
uttered
so
much
as
an
speech
in
all
america
there
was
perhaps
not
one
man
who
less
deserved
to
be
the
victim
of
this
revolution
than
he
who
has
just
fallen
the
ministry
did
not
wait
for
public
pressure
immediately
on
receipt
of
the
news
motions
were
made
april
in
both
lords
and
commons
for
an
address
to
the
queen
to
be
debated
monday
next
expressing
sorrow
and
indignation
at
the
assassination
of
lincoln
april
russell
instructed
bruce
to
express
at
washington
that
the
government
the
parliament
and
the
nation
are
affected
by
a
unanimous
feeling
of
abhorrence
of
the
criminals
guilty
of
these
cowardly
and
atrocious
crimes
and
sympathy
for
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
russell
wrote
here
of
both
lincoln
and
seward
the
queen
wrote
a
personal
letter
of
sympathy
to
lincoln
already
bruce
had
written
from
washington
that
lincoln
was
the
only
friend
of
the
south
in
his
party
and
he
was
extremely
anxious
that
recovery
might
be
hastened
fearing
the
possibility
of
assumption
of
the
secretaryship
of
state
we
miss
terribly
the
comparative
moderation
of
lincoln
and
seward
illustration
britannia
sympathises
with
columbia
by
permission
of
the
proprietors
of
punch
the
american
minister
naturally
became
the
centre
toward
which
the
public
outpouring
of
sympathy
was
directed
the
excitement
in
this
country
has
been
deep
and
wide
spreading
through
all
classes
of
society
my
table
is
piled
high
with
cards
letters
and
resolutions
indeed
all
the
old
sources
of
addresses
to
adams
on
emancipation
and
many
organizations
having
no
professed
interest
in
that
subject
now
sent
to
him
resolutions
the
emancipation
societies
of
horror
indignation
and
even
accusation
against
the
south
the
others
of
sympathy
more
moderate
in
tone
yet
all
evincing
an
appreciation
of
the
great
qualities
of
lincoln
and
of
the
justice
of
the
cause
of
the
north
now
victorious
within
two
weeks
adams
reported
over
four
hundred
such
addresses
from
emancipation
societies
chambers
of
commerce
trades
unions
municipalities
boroughs
churches
indeed
from
every
known
type
of
british
organizations
on
may
the
motion
for
the
address
to
the
crown
came
up
for
debate
in
the
lords
russell
emphasized
the
kindly
and
forgiving
qualities
of
lincoln
as
just
those
needed
in
america
and
now
lost
by
his
death
derby
for
the
opposition
expressed
the
horror
of
the
world
at
act
joined
in
expressions
of
sympathy
to
the
united
states
but
repeated
the
old
phrase
about
the
north
fighting
for
empire
the
south
for
independence
and
hinted
that
the
unusual
step
now
being
taken
by
parliament
had
in
it
a
political
object
meaning
that
the
motion
had
been
introduced
in
the
hope
of
easing
american
irritation
with
great
britain
it
was
not
a
tactful
speech
but
derby
lieutenant
in
the
commons
disraeli
saved
his
party
from
criticism
by
what
was
distinctly
the
most
thoughtful
and
utterance
of
the
day
palmerston
was
ill
the
government
speech
was
made
by
grey
who
incautiously
began
by
asserting
that
the
majority
of
the
people
of
great
britain
had
always
been
on
the
side
of
the
north
and
was
met
by
cries
of
no
no
and
hear
hear
disraeli
concluded
the
debate
he
said
there
are
rare
instances
when
the
sympathy
of
a
nation
approaches
those
tenderer
feelings
that
generally
speaking
are
supposed
to
be
peculiar
to
the
individual
and
to
form
the
happy
privilege
of
private
life
and
this
is
one
under
all
circumstances
we
should
have
bewailed
the
catastrophe
at
washington
under
all
circumstances
we
should
have
shuddered
at
the
means
by
which
it
was
accomplished
but
in
the
character
of
the
victim
and
even
in
the
accessories
of
his
last
moments
there
is
something
so
homely
and
so
innocent
that
it
takes
as
it
were
the
subject
out
of
all
the
pomp
of
history
and
the
ceremonial
of
diplomacy
it
touches
the
heart
of
nations
and
appeals
to
the
domestic
sentiment
of
mankind
sir
whatever
the
various
and
varying
opinions
in
this
house
and
in
the
country
generally
on
the
policy
of
the
late
president
of
the
united
states
on
this
i
think
all
must
agree
that
in
one
of
the
severest
trials
which
ever
tested
the
moral
qualities
of
man
he
fulfilled
his
duty
with
simplicity
and
strength
nor
is
it
possible
for
the
people
of
england
at
such
a
moment
to
forget
that
he
sprang
from
the
same
fatherland
and
spoke
the
same
mother
tongue
when
such
crimes
are
perpetrated
the
public
mind
is
apt
to
fall
into
gloom
and
perplexity
for
it
is
ignorant
alike
of
the
causes
and
the
consequences
of
such
deeds
but
it
is
one
of
our
duties
to
reassure
the
country
under
unreasoning
panic
or
despondency
assassination
has
never
changed
the
history
of
the
world
in
expressing
our
unaffected
and
profound
sympathy
with
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
at
the
untimely
end
of
their
elected
chief
let
us
not
therefore
sanction
any
feeling
of
depression
but
rather
let
us
express
a
fervent
hope
that
from
out
the
awful
trials
of
the
last
four
years
of
which
not
the
least
is
this
violent
demise
the
various
populations
of
north
america
may
issue
elevated
and
chastened
rich
in
that
accumulated
wisdom
and
strong
in
that
disciplined
energy
which
a
young
nation
can
only
acquire
in
a
protracted
and
perilous
struggle
then
they
will
be
enabled
not
merely
to
renew
their
career
of
power
and
prosperity
but
they
will
renew
it
to
contribute
to
the
general
happiness
of
mankind
it
is
with
these
feelings
sir
that
i
second
the
address
to
the
crown
lincoln
assassination
served
to
bring
out
not
only
british
popular
sympathy
but
also
the
certitude
that
the
war
was
over
and
the
north
victorious
but
officially
the
government
had
not
yet
recognized
this
even
as
early
as
january
seward
had
returned
to
the
old
proposal
that
the
nations
of
europe
should
withdraw
their
recognition
of
southern
belligerent
rights
and
in
march
he
had
asked
stoeckl
the
russian
minister
whether
russia
would
not
lead
in
the
suggestion
of
this
measure
to
england
and
france
meanwhile
sherman
army
was
rapidly
advancing
northward
and
reports
were
arriving
of
its
pillagings
and
burnings
march
gregory
asked
in
the
commons
whether
the
government
was
taking
any
steps
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
british
property
and
received
from
layard
an
evasive
reply
merely
a
confident
hope
had
been
expressed
to
the
united
states
that
every
facility
will
be
given
to
british
subjects
to
prove
ownership
of
property
evidently
the
government
was
not
eager
to
raise
irritating
questions
at
a
moment
when
all
eyes
were
strained
to
observe
the
concluding
events
of
the
war
then
came
the
news
of
lee
surrender
and
of
the
assassination
of
lincoln
with
the
attack
on
seward
already
incapacitated
from
active
duties
seward
illness
delayed
american
pressure
on
england
a
fortunate
circumstance
in
the
relations
with
great
britain
in
that
it
gave
time
for
a
clearer
appreciation
of
the
rapidity
and
completeness
of
the
collapse
of
the
south
may
lord
houghton
asked
whether
the
government
did
not
intend
in
view
of
recent
events
in
america
to
withdraw
the
admission
of
belligerent
rights
conceded
to
the
confederate
states
russell
promptly
objected
to
the
form
of
the
question
england
had
not
conceded
any
rights
to
the
south
she
had
merely
issued
a
proclamation
of
neutrality
after
lincoln
had
declared
the
existence
of
a
war
by
proclaiming
a
blockade
england
had
had
no
other
recourse
unless
she
chose
to
refuse
recognition
of
the
blockade
and
this
would
have
drawn
her
into
the
war
as
to
a
withdrawal
of
the
neutrality
proclamation
this
must
wait
upon
official
announcement
from
the
united
states
that
the
war
was
at
an
end
texas
was
still
in
arms
and
galveston
still
blockaded
and
for
this
section
the
united
states
would
no
doubt
continue
to
exercise
on
neutral
vessels
a
belligerent
right
of
search
it
followed
that
if
great
britain
did
prematurely
withdraw
her
proclamation
of
neutrality
and
the
united
states
searched
a
british
vessel
it
would
be
the
exercise
of
a
right
of
search
in
time
of
peace
an
act
against
which
great
britain
would
be
bound
to
make
vigorous
protest
hence
england
must
wait
on
american
action
proclaiming
the
end
of
the
war
russell
concluded
by
expressing
gratification
at
the
prospect
of
peace
but
matters
were
not
to
take
this
orderly
and
logical
course
seward
though
still
extremely
weak
and
confined
to
his
home
was
eager
to
resume
the
duties
of
office
and
on
may
a
cabinet
was
held
at
his
house
a
week
later
bruce
wrote
to
russell
in
some
anxiety
that
america
was
about
to
the
withdrawal
by
great
britain
of
belligerent
rights
to
the
south
that
if
great
britain
would
but
act
before
such
a
demand
was
made
it
would
serve
to
continue
the
existing
good
feeling
in
america
created
by
the
sympathy
over
lincoln
death
and
especially
that
there
was
a
decided
danger
to
good
relations
in
the
fact
that
confederate
cruisers
were
still
at
large
he
urged
that
orders
should
be
sent
to
stop
their
presence
in
british
colonial
ports
securing
coal
and
supplies
three
days
later
bruce
repeated
his
warning
this
was
apparently
a
complication
unforeseen
at
the
foreign
office
in
any
case
russell
at
once
made
a
complete
from
the
policy
he
had
outlined
in
reply
to
lord
houghton
on
may
he
instructed
cowley
in
paris
to
notify
france
that
england
thought
the
time
had
arrived
for
recognition
that
the
war
was
ended
and
laid
special
stress
upon
the
question
of
confederate
cruisers
still
at
sea
and
their
proper
treatment
in
british
ports
thus
having
given
to
france
notice
of
his
intention
but
without
waiting
for
concurrent
action
russell
on
june
issued
instructions
to
the
admiralty
that
the
war
was
ended
and
stated
the
lines
upon
which
the
confederate
cruisers
were
to
be
treated
here
was
prompt
even
hurried
action
though
the
only
additional
event
of
war
in
america
which
russell
could
at
the
moment
cite
to
warrant
his
change
of
policy
was
the
capture
of
jefferson
davis
on
the
same
day
russell
wrote
to
bruce
stating
what
had
been
done
and
recognizing
the
of
peace
within
the
whole
territory
of
which
the
united
states
before
the
commencement
of
the
civil
war
were
in
undisturbed
possession
this
sudden
shift
by
the
government
did
not
escape
derby
caustic
criticism
june
he
referred
in
parliament
to
houghton
previous
inquiry
and
russell
answer
asking
why
the
government
had
not
stuck
to
its
earlier
position
and
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
united
states
while
now
proclaiming
certain
ports
open
to
trade
yet
specified
others
as
still
closed
and
threatened
with
punishment
as
pirates
any
vessel
attempting
to
enter
them
derby
desired
information
as
to
what
the
government
had
done
about
this
remarkable
american
proclamation
russell
who
was
very
imperfectly
heard
answered
that
undoubtedly
it
was
embarrassing
that
no
regular
communication
had
been
received
from
america
giving
notice
of
the
end
of
the
war
but
that
the
two
confederate
cruisers
still
at
sea
and
the
entrance
of
one
of
them
to
various
australian
ports
had
compelled
some
british
action
he
had
consulted
adams
who
had
no
instructions
but
felt
confident
the
united
states
would
soon
formally
declare
the
end
of
the
war
the
piracy
proclamation
was
certainly
a
strange
proceeding
derby
pushed
for
an
answer
as
to
whether
the
government
intended
to
let
it
go
by
unnoticed
russell
replied
that
a
despatch
from
bruce
showed
that
notice
had
been
taken
of
it
derby
asked
whether
the
papers
would
be
presented
to
parliament
russell
was
understood
to
reply
in
the
affirmative
derby
inquiry
was
plainly
merely
a
hectoring
of
russell
for
his
quick
shift
from
the
position
taken
a
month
earlier
but
the
very
indifference
of
russell
to
this
attack
his
carelessness
and
evasion
in
reply
indicate
confidence
that
parliament
was
as
eager
as
the
government
to
satisfy
the
north
and
to
avoid
friction
the
only
actual
notice
taken
by
bruce
at
washington
of
the
piracy
proclamation
was
in
fact
to
report
it
to
russell
commenting
that
it
was
unintelligible
and
probably
a
mere
attempt
to
frighten
foreign
russell
instructed
bruce
not
to
ask
for
an
explanation
since
galveston
had
been
captured
subsequent
to
the
date
of
the
proclamation
and
there
was
presumably
no
port
left
where
it
could
be
applied
in
truth
the
actual
events
of
the
closing
days
of
the
war
had
outrun
diplomatic
action
by
america
scattered
southern
forces
still
in
the
field
surrendered
with
an
unexpected
rapidity
while
at
washington
all
was
temporarily
in
confusion
upon
the
death
of
lincoln
and
the
illness
of
seward
bruce
advice
had
been
wise
and
the
prompt
action
of
russell
fortunate
seward
at
once
accepted
russell
notification
of
june
as
ending
british
neutrality
while
again
insisting
upon
the
essential
injustice
of
the
original
concession
of
belligerent
rights
to
the
south
and
objecting
to
some
details
in
the
instructions
to
the
admiralty
he
yet
admitted
that
normal
relations
were
again
established
and
acknowledged
that
the
united
states
could
no
longer
exercise
a
right
of
search
july
russell
presented
this
paper
to
parliament
reading
that
portion
in
which
seward
expressed
his
pleasure
that
the
united
states
could
now
enter
again
upon
normal
relations
with
great
britain
two
days
later
russell
wrote
to
bruce
that
he
had
not
expected
seward
to
acknowledge
the
rightfulness
of
england
neutrality
position
pointed
out
that
his
admiralty
instructions
were
misunderstood
and
were
less
objectionable
than
appeared
and
concluded
by
the
expression
of
a
hope
for
the
establishment
of
a
lasting
and
intimate
friendship
between
the
two
nations
great
britain
wrote
the
russian
minister
in
washington
in
january
was
about
to
experience
one
of
those
strokes
of
fortune
which
occurred
but
rarely
in
the
history
of
nations
in
the
approaching
dissolution
of
the
american
union
she
alone
of
all
the
nations
of
the
world
would
benefit
by
it
in
the
expansion
of
her
power
hitherto
blocked
by
the
might
of
the
united
states
broken
into
two
or
more
hostile
pieces
america
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
england
to
become
her
plaything
the
cabinet
of
london
is
watching
attentively
the
internal
dissensions
of
the
union
and
awaits
the
result
with
an
impatience
which
it
has
difficulty
in
disguising
great
britain
would
soon
in
return
for
cotton
give
recognition
to
the
south
and
if
required
armed
support
for
this
same
cotton
she
would
oppose
emancipation
of
the
slaves
the
of
the
union
was
no
less
than
a
disaster
for
all
nations
save
england
since
hitherto
the
struggle
between
england
and
the
united
states
has
been
the
best
guarantee
against
the
ambitious
projects
and
political
egotism
of
the
race
this
prophecy
made
over
a
year
in
advance
of
events
was
repeated
frequently
as
the
crisis
in
america
approached
and
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
war
stoeckl
was
not
solitary
in
such
opinion
the
french
minister
of
foreign
affairs
held
it
also
and
the
french
emperor
puzzled
himself
in
vain
to
discover
why
great
britain
in
furtherance
of
her
own
interests
did
not
eagerly
accept
his
overtures
for
a
vigorous
joint
action
in
support
of
the
south
the
preceding
chapters
of
this
work
will
have
shown
how
unfounded
was
such
prophecy
stoeckl
was
behind
the
times
knowing
nothing
apparently
of
that
positive
change
in
british
policy
in
the
late
which
resulted
in
a
determination
to
cease
opposition
to
the
expansion
of
american
power
such
opposition
was
then
acknowledged
to
have
been
an
error
and
in
its
place
there
sprang
into
being
a
conviction
that
the
might
of
america
would
tend
toward
the
greatness
of
england
itself
in
the
months
preceding
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
all
british
governmental
effort
was
directed
toward
keeping
clear
of
the
quarrel
and
toward
conciliation
of
the
two
sections
no
doubt
there
were
those
in
great
britain
who
rejoiced
at
the
rupture
between
north
and
south
but
they
were
not
in
office
and
had
no
control
of
british
policy
the
war
once
begun
the
government
anxious
to
keep
clear
of
it
was
prompt
in
proclaiming
neutrality
and
hastened
this
step
for
fear
of
maritime
complications
with
that
one
of
the
belligerents
the
north
which
alone
possessed
a
naval
force
but
the
british
ministry
like
that
of
every
other
european
state
believed
that
a
revolution
for
independence
when
undertaken
by
a
people
so
numerous
and
powerful
as
that
of
the
south
must
ultimately
succeed
hence
as
the
war
dragged
on
the
ministry
pressed
from
various
angles
at
home
ventured
with
much
uncertainty
upon
a
movement
looking
toward
mediation
its
desire
was
first
of
all
for
the
restoration
of
world
peace
nor
can
any
other
motive
be
discovered
in
russell
manoeuvres
this
attempt
fortunately
for
america
and
it
may
be
believed
for
the
world
was
blocked
by
cool
heads
within
the
ministry
itself
there
was
quick
and
as
it
proved
permanent
readjustment
of
policy
to
the
earlier
decision
not
to
meddle
in
the
american
crisis
this
very
failure
to
meddle
was
cause
of
great
complaint
by
both
north
and
south
each
expectant
from
divergent
reasons
of
british
sympathy
and
aid
the
very
anger
of
the
north
at
british
cold
neutrality
is
evidence
of
how
little
america
feeling
the
ties
of
race
and
sentiment
could
have
understood
the
mistaken
of
diplomats
like
stoeckl
who
dwelt
in
realms
of
reasons
of
state
unaffected
by
popular
emotions
aside
from
race
which
could
be
claimed
also
by
the
south
the
one
great
argument
of
the
north
in
appeal
to
england
lay
in
the
cry
of
but
the
leaders
of
the
north
denied
its
pertinence
itself
unsympathetic
with
the
emotions
of
emancipation
societies
at
home
the
british
government
settled
down
by
the
end
of
to
a
fixed
policy
of
strict
neutrality
in
all
this
the
government
but
pursued
that
line
which
is
the
business
of
governments
the
preservation
of
the
prosperity
and
power
of
the
state
with
the
unexpected
prolongation
of
the
war
and
the
british
recognition
of
the
northern
will
to
conquer
there
came
as
is
evident
from
a
scrutiny
of
russell
diplomatic
tone
and
acts
a
growing
belief
that
the
north
might
after
all
succeed
in
its
purpose
at
least
of
subjugating
the
south
this
would
mean
the
possibility
of
continuing
that
policy
of
friendship
for
a
united
america
which
had
been
determined
upon
in
the
here
was
no
special
sympathy
but
merely
a
cool
calculation
of
benefits
to
great
britain
but
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
general
attitude
of
the
government
by
midsummer
of
was
distinctly
favourable
to
a
restored
union
a
friendly
neutrality
began
to
replace
a
cold
neutrality
but
it
is
the
business
of
governments
not
merely
to
guard
national
interests
and
prosperity
they
also
must
guard
their
own
authority
and
seek
to
remain
in
political
power
here
emancipation
never
greatly
stirring
the
leaders
whether
whig
or
tory
exercised
an
increasing
pressure
by
the
force
of
public
approval
it
made
impossible
any
attempt
to
overthrow
the
ministry
on
the
score
of
in
america
or
of
favouritism
toward
the
north
it
gave
to
an
enthusiastic
and
vociferous
section
of
the
british
public
just
ground
for
strong
support
of
lincoln
and
his
cause
and
in
some
degree
it
affected
governmental
attitude
there
was
however
another
question
much
more
vital
than
emancipation
in
its
relation
to
british
home
politics
that
ran
like
a
constant
thread
through
the
whole
pattern
of
british
public
attitude
toward
america
it
had
always
been
so
since
the
days
of
the
american
revolution
and
now
was
accentuated
by
the
american
war
this
was
the
question
of
the
future
of
democracy
was
its
fate
bound
up
with
the
result
of
that
war
and
if
so
where
lay
british
interest
always
present
in
the
minds
of
thoughtful
englishmen
appearing
again
and
again
through
each
changing
phase
of
the
war
this
question
was
so
much
a
constant
that
to
have
attempted
discussion
of
it
while
other
topics
were
being
treated
would
have
resulted
in
repetition
and
confusion
it
is
therefore
made
the
subject
of
a
separate
and
concluding

the
of
british
attitude
on
may
the
news
was
received
in
london
of
johnston
surrender
to
sherman
on
that
same
day
there
occurred
in
the
commons
the
first
serious
debate
in
years
on
a
proposed
expansion
of
the
electoral
franchise
it
was
a
dramatic
coincidence
and
no
mere
fortuitous
one
in
the
minds
of
thoughtful
englishmen
who
had
seen
in
the
civil
war
a
struggle
as
fateful
in
british
domestic
policy
as
in
that
of
america
herself
throughout
all
british
political
agitation
from
the
time
of
the
american
revolution
in
there
had
run
the
thread
of
the
american
example
as
argument
to
some
for
imitation
to
others
for
warning
nearly
every
british
traveller
in
america
publishing
his
impressions
felt
compelled
to
report
on
american
governmental
and
political
institutions
and
did
so
from
his
preconceived
notions
of
what
was
desirable
in
his
own
country
in
the
ten
years
immediately
preceding
the
civil
war
most
travellers
were
laudatory
of
american
democracy
and
one
the
best
in
acute
analysis
up
to
the
time
of
lord
bryce
great
work
had
much
influence
on
that
class
in
england
which
was
discontented
with
existing
political
institutions
at
home
this
was
mackay
which
first
published
in
had
gone
through
four
editions
in
and
in
succeeding
years
was
frequently
reprinted
republicanism
mackay
asserted
was
no
longer
an
experiment
its
success
and
permanence
were
evident
in
the
mighty
power
of
the
united
states
canada
would
soon
follow
the
american
example
the
injustice
of
british
aristocrats
to
the
united
states
was
intentional
seeking
to
discredit
democracy
englishmen
are
too
prone
to
mingle
severity
with
their
judgments
whenever
the
republic
is
concerned
it
is
the
interest
of
aristocracy
to
exhibit
republicanism
it
is
found
in
the
worst
possible
light
and
the
mass
of
the
people
have
too
long
by
pandering
to
their
prejudice
aided
them
in
their
object
they
recognize
america
as
the
stronghold
of
republicanism
if
they
can
bring
it
into
disrepute
here
they
know
that
they
inflict
upon
it
the
deadliest
blow
in
europe
on
the
opposing
side
were
other
writers
tremenheere
argued
the
inapplicability
of
american
institutions
to
great
britain
the
theoretical
bases
of
those
institutions
were
in
some
respects
admirable
but
in
actual
practice
they
had
resulted
in
the
rule
of
the
mob
and
had
debased
the
nation
in
the
estimation
of
the
world
bribery
in
elections
the
low
order
of
men
in
politics
and
in
congress
were
proofs
of
the
evils
of
democracy
those
in
england
who
clamoured
for
a
numerical
rather
than
a
class
representation
should
take
warning
from
the
american
experiment
occasionally
though
rarely
there
appeared
the
impressions
of
some
british
traveller
who
had
no
political
axe
to
grind
but
from
to
as
in
every
previous
decade
british
writing
on
america
was
coloured
by
the
author
attitude
on
political
institutions
at
home
the
example
of
america
was
constantly
on
the
horizon
in
british
politics
in
the
liberal
movement
in
england
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
since
the
high
tide
of
palmerston
was
generally
believed
to
have
made
a
private
agreement
with
derby
that
both
whig
and
tory
parties
would
oppose
any
movement
toward
an
expansion
of
the
franchise
lord
john
russell
in
his
youth
an
eager
supporter
of
the
reform
bill
of
had
now
gained
the
name
of
finality
john
by
his
assertion
that
that
reform
was
final
in
british
institutions
political
reaction
was
in
full
swing
much
to
the
discontent
of
radicals
like
bright
and
cobden
and
their
supporters
when
the
storm
broke
in
america
the
personal
characteristics
of
the
two
leaders
north
and
south
lincoln
and
davis
took
on
to
many
british
eyes
an
altogether
extreme
importance
as
if
representative
of
the
political
philosophies
of
the
two
sections
lincoln
crudity
was
democratic
davis
culture
was
aristocratic
nor
is
it
to
be
denied
that
davis
had
aristocratic
views
on
government
but
that
this
issue
had
any
vital
bearing
on
the
quarrel
between
the
american
sections
was
never
generally
voiced
in
england
rather
british
comment
was
directed
to
the
lesson
taught
to
the
world
by
the
american
crisis
of
the
failure
of
democratic
institutions
in
bright
had
long
preached
to
the
unenfranchised
of
england
the
prosperity
and
might
of
america
and
these
had
long
been
denied
by
the
aristocratic
faction
to
be
a
result
of
democratic
institutions
at
first
the
denial
was
now
repeated
the
february
protesting
that
there
was
no
essential
connection
between
the
shipwreck
of
american
institutions
and
the
movement
in
england
for
an
expanded
franchise
even
the
article
continued
if
an
attempt
were
made
to
show
such
a
connection
it
would
convince
nobody
since
mr
bright
has
succeeded
in
persuading
a
great
number
of
influential
persons
that
the
admission
of
into
the
constituencies
is
chiefly
if
not
solely
desirable
on
the
ground
that
it
has
succeeded
admirably
in
america
and
has
proved
a
sovereign
panacea
against
the
war
taxation
and
confusion
which
are
the
curses
of
old
governments
in
europe
yet
that
the
denial
was
not
sincere
is
shown
by
the
further
assertion
that
the
shallow
demagogues
of
birmingham
and
other
kindred
platforms
must
bear
the
blame
of
the
inference
drawn
nearly
universally
at
the
present
moment
that
if
the
united
states
become
involved
in
hopeless
difficulties
it
would
be
madness
to
lower
the
qualification
for
the
suffrage
in
england
this
pretended
disclaimer
of
any
essential
relation
between
the
american
struggle
and
british
institutions
was
not
long
persisted
in
a
month
later
the
was
strong
in
contemptuous
criticism
of
the
promiscuous
democracy
of
the
north
less
political
journals
followed
suit
the
thought
the
people
of
england
would
now
be
convinced
of
the
folly
of
aping
america
and
that
those
who
had
advocated
universal
suffrage
would
be
filled
with
mingled
alarm
gratitude
and
shame
soon
russell
could
write
while
still
at
washington
the
world
will
only
see
in
it
all
the
failure
of
republican
institutions
in
time
of
pressure
as
demonstrated
by
all
history
that
history
which
america
vainly
thought
she
was
going
to
set
right
and
on
new
grounds
and
principles
the
english
worshippers
of
american
institutions
said
the
are
in
danger
of
losing
their
last
pretext
for
preferring
the
republic
to
the
obsolete
and
tyrannical
monarchy
of
england
it
now
appears
that
the
peaceable
completion
of
the
secession
has
become
impossible
and
it
will
be
necessary
to
discover
some
new
ground
of
superiority
by
which
buchanan
or
lincoln
may
be
advantageously
contrasted
with
queen
victoria
these
expressions
antedated
the
news
of
the
actual
opening
of
the
war
and
may
be
regarded
as
jeers
at
bright
and
his
followers
rather
than
as
attempts
to
read
a
lesson
to
the
public
no
such
expressions
are
to
be
found
in
the
letters
of
leading
officials
though
minor
ones
occasionally
indulged
in
them
as
late
as
june
adams
declared
that
while
some
in
england
welcomed
american
disunion
as
a
warning
to
their
countrymen
it
was
evident
that
but
a
small
number
as
yet
saw
the
cause
of
the
north
as
identical
with
the
world
progress
of
free
institutions
evidently
he
was
disappointed
that
the
followers
of
bright
were
not
exhibiting
more
courage
and
demanding
public
support
of
the
north
as
fighting
their
battle
at
home
they
were
indeed
strangely
silent
depressed
no
doubt
by
american
events
and
discouraged
it
required
time
also
to
arouse
intensity
of
feeling
on
the
american
question
and
to
see
clearly
the
issues
involved
aristocratic
britain
was
first
to
declare
a
definite
lesson
to
be
learned
thereby
bringing
out
the
fighting
qualities
of
british
democracy
throughout
the
comment
was
relatively
mild
in
july
declared
it
is
precisely
because
we
do
not
share
the
admiration
of
america
for
her
own
institutions
and
political
tendencies
that
we
do
not
now
see
in
the
impending
change
an
event
altogether
to
be
deplored
in
those
institutions
and
tendencies
we
saw
what
our
own
might
be
if
the
most
dangerous
elements
of
our
constitution
should
become
dominant
we
saw
democracy
rampant
with
no
restriction
upon
its
caprices
we
saw
a
policy
which
received
its
impulses
always
from
below
nor
need
we
affect
particularly
to
lament
the
exhibition
of
the
weak
point
of
a
constitution
the
disruption
of
which
leaves
entirely
untouched
the
laws
and
usages
which
america
owes
to
england
and
which
have
contributed
so
powerfully
to
her
prosperity
with
a
rival
government
on
the
frontier
with
great
principles
to
be
not
vapoured
about
but
put
to
the
proof
we
should
probably
see
the
natural
aristocracy
rise
from
the
dead
level
of
the
republic
raising
the
national
character
with
its
own
elevation
in
the
same
month
the
always
more
calm
logical
and
convincing
than
published
democracy
on
its
trial
the
example
of
america
kept
alive
as
it
had
created
the
party
of
progress
now
it
has
sunk
from
the
decrepitude
of
premature
old
age
if
england
after
such
an
example
permits
herself
to
be
led
into
democracy
she
will
have
perished
by
that
wilful
infatuation
which
no
warning
can
dispel
adams
had
complained
that
few
british
friends
of
progress
identified
the
cause
of
the
north
with
their
own
but
this
was
true
of
americans
also
the
for
july
discussed
british
attitude
wholly
in
terms
of
cotton
supply
but
soon
there
appeared
in
the
british
press
so
many
preachments
on
the
lesson
of
america
that
the
aristocratic
effort
to
gain
an
advantage
at
home
became
apparent
to
all
the
moralized
on
the
untried
character
of
american
institutions
and
statesmen
the
latter
usually
as
ignorant
as
the
masses
whom
they
represented
and
if
more
intellectual
still
more
worthy
of
contempt
because
of
their
voluntary
moral
degradation
to
the
level
of
their
constituents
the
upper
and
ruling
class
wrote
bright
to
sumner
were
observing
with
satisfaction
that
democracy
may
get
into
trouble
and
war
and
debt
and
taxes
as
aristocracy
has
done
for
this
country
thus
bright
could
not
deny
the
blow
to
democracy
nor
could
the
upbraiding
its
countrymen
for
lack
of
sympathy
with
the
north
new
england
will
be
justified
in
saying
that
old
england
sympathies
are
mere
hollow
sentimental
pretences
since
she
can
rest
satisfied
to
stuff
her
ears
with
cotton
against
the
cries
of
the
slaves
and
to
compensate
her
gentle
regret
over
the
new
impulse
given
to
slavery
by
her
lively
gratification
over
the
paralyzing
shock
suffered
by
democracy
this
was
no
taking
up
of
cudgels
for
the
north
and
progress
such
as
adams
had
hoped
for
vigour
rested
with
the
opposing
side
and
increased
when
hopes
of
a
short
war
vanished
the
asserted
in
that
reconstruction
of
political
philosophy
which
the
american
calamities
are
likely
to
inaugurate
the
value
of
the
popular
element
will
be
reduced
to
its
due
proportions
the
true
guarantee
of
freedom
will
be
looked
for
more
in
the
equilibrium
of
classes
than
in
the
equality
of
individuals
we
may
hope
at
last
that
the
delusive
confusion
between
freedom
and
democracy
is
finally
banished
from
the
minds
of
englishmen
the
real
secret
wrote
motley
of
the
exultation
which
manifests
itself
in
the
and
other
organs
over
our
troubles
and
disasters
is
their
hatred
not
to
america
so
much
as
to
democracy
in
england
it
was
scarcely
a
secret
in
the
columns
of
the
journals
already
quoted
but
no
similar
interpretation
had
as
yet
appeared
in
the
and
motley
implication
was
justified
for
it
and
other
leading
daily
newspapers
the
reviews
and
weeklies
were
for
the
moment
leading
the
attack
possibly
one
reason
for
the
slowness
in
reply
of
bright
and
his
followers
not
all
reviews
joined
in
the
usual
analysis
the
at
first
saw
in
slavery
the
sole
cause
of
the
american
dispute
then
attributed
it
to
the
inevitable
failure
in
power
of
a
federal
system
of
government
not
mentioning
democracy
as
in
question
repeatedly
pushed
home
its
argument
independent
of
motives
of
humanity
we
are
glad
that
the
end
of
the
union
seems
more
likely
to
be
ridiculous
than
terrible
but
for
our
own
benefit
and
the
instruction
of
the
world
we
wish
to
see
the
faults
so
specious
and
so
fatal
of
their
political
system
exposed
in
the
most
effective
way
and
the
venerable
lincoln
the
respectable
seward
the
raving
editors
the
gibbering
mob
and
the
warriors
of
bull
run
are
no
malicious
tricks
of
fortune
played
off
on
an
unwary
nation
but
are
all
of
them
the
legitimate
offspring
of
the
great
republic
dandled
and
nursed
one
might
say
coddled
by
fortune
the
spoiled
child
democracy
after
playing
strange
pranks
before
high
heaven
and
figuring
in
odd
and
unexpected
disguises
dies
as
sheerly
from
lack
of
vitality
as
the
oldest
of
despotisms
in
the
hope
that
this
contest
may
end
in
the
extinction
of
mob
rule
we
become
reconciled
to
the
much
slighter
amount
of
suffering
that
war
inflicts
on
america
equally
outspoken
were
a
few
public
men
who
early
espoused
the
cause
of
the
south
beresford
hope
before
a
distinguished
audience
used
language
insulting
to
the
north
fawning
upon
the
south
and
picturing
the
latter
as
wholly
admirable
for
its
aristocratic
tendencies
for
this
he
was
sharply
taken
to
task
by
the
more
sedately
the
earl
of
shrewsbury
proclaimed
i
see
in
america
the
trial
of
democracy
and
its
failure
i
believe
that
the
dissolution
of
the
union
is
inevitable
and
that
men
now
before
me
will
live
to
see
an
aristocracy
established
in
america
in
all
countries
and
at
all
times
there
are
men
in
early
prophecy
on
current
events
but
in
such
utterances
as
these
there
is
manifest
not
merely
the
customary
desire
to
stand
in
the
limelight
of
assured
knowledge
and
wisdom
but
also
the
happy
conviction
that
events
in
america
were
working
to
the
undoing
of
the
radicals
of
great
britain
if
they
would
not
be
supine
the
radicals
must
strike
back
on
december
at
rochdale
where
as
the
asserted
he
was
sure
of
an
audience
sympathetic
on
purely
personal
grounds
bright
renewed
his
profession
of
faith
in
the
american
republic
and
sang
his
accustomed
praises
of
its
great
accomplishments
the
battle
for
england
on
american
democracy
was
joined
the
challenge
issued
by
aristocratic
england
accepted
but
apart
from
extreme
factions
at
either
end
of
the
scale
there
stood
a
group
holding
a
middle
ground
opinion
not
yet
sure
of
the
historical
significance
of
the
american
collapse
to
this
group
belonged
gladstone
as
yet
uncertain
of
his
political
philosophy
and
regretful
though
vainly
it
would
appear
of
the
blow
to
democracy
he
wrote
his
thought
to
brougham
no
doubt
hoping
to
influence
the
of
the
this
has
without
doubt
been
a
deplorable
year
for
poor
and
never
has
the
old
woman
been
at
a
heavier
discount
since
i
see
no
discredit
to
the
founders
of
the
american
constitution
in
the
main
fact
of
the
rupture
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
great
achievement
to
strike
off
by
the
will
and
wit
of
man
a
constitution
for
two
millions
of
men
scattered
along
a
seaboard
which
has
lasted
until
they
have
become
more
than
thirty
millions
and
have
covered
a
whole
continent
but
the
freaks
pranks
and
follies
not
to
say
worse
with
which
the
rupture
has
been
met
in
the
northern
states
down
to
chase
financial
not
exposition
but
exposure
have
really
given
as
i
have
said
the
old
lady
in
question
such
a
heavy
blow
and
great
discouragement
that
i
hope
you
will
in
the
first
vigour
of
your
action
be
a
little
merciful
and
human
lest
you
murder
her
outright
on
this
middle
group
of
englishmen
and
their
moral
conceptions
the
american
minister
adams
at
first
pinned
his
faith
not
believing
in
that
the
issues
of
democracy
or
of
trade
advantage
would
lead
great
britain
from
just
rules
of
conduct
even
in
the
crisis
of
the
affair
he
was
firm
in
this
opinion
much
as
the
commercial
and
manufacturing
interests
may
be
disposed
to
view
the
tariff
as
the
source
of
all
our
evils
and
much
as
the
aristocratic
classes
may
endeavour
to
make
democracy
responsible
for
them
the
inexorable
logic
of
events
is
contradicting
each
and
every
assertion
based
on
these
notions
and
proving
that
the
american
struggle
is
after
all
the
one
in
human
affairs
between
right
and
wrong
between
labour
and
capital
between
liberty
and
absolutism
when
such
an
issue
comes
to
be
presented
to
the
people
of
great
britain
stripped
of
all
the
disguises
which
have
been
thrown
over
it
it
is
not
difficult
to
predict
at
least
which
side
it
will
consent
to
take
april
saw
the
beginning
of
the
aristocratic
challenge
on
american
democracy
and
december
its
acceptance
by
bright
throughout
he
practically
deserted
his
seat
in
parliament
and
devoted
himself
to
stirring
up
labour
and
radical
sentiment
in
favour
of
the
north
in
january
a
mass
meeting
at
new
hall
edgware
road
denounced
the
daily
press
and
was
thought
of
sufficient
moment
to
be
reported
by
adams
a
motion
was
carried
that
in
the
opinion
of
this
meeting
considering
the
efforts
of
the
and
other
misleading
journals
to
misrepresent
public
opinion
here
on
all
american
questions
to
decry
democratic
institutions
under
the
trials
to
which
the
republic
is
exposed
it
is
the
duty
of
the
especially
as
unrepresented
in
the
national
senate
to
express
their
sympathy
with
the
united
states
in
their
gigantic
struggle
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
the
daily
press
was
in
fact
now
joining
more
openly
in
the
controversy
the
stating
with
conviction
its
belief
that
there
could
be
no
in
america
added
if
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
succeed
in
reannexing
them
the
southern
states
to
its
still
extensive
dominions
democracy
will
have
achieved
its
grandest
triumph
since
the
world
began
it
will
have
demonstrated
to
the
ample
satisfaction
of
its
present
and
future
proselytes
that
it
is
even
more
puissant
in
war
than
in
peace
that
it
can
navigate
not
only
the
smooth
seas
of
unendangered
prosperity
but
can
ride
safely
through
the
fiercest
tempests
that
would
engulf
every
other
craft
laden
with
human
destinies
that
it
can
descend
to
the
darkest
depths
of
adversity
and
rise
from
them
all
the
stronger
for
the
descent
and
who
can
doubt
that
democracy
will
be
more
arrogant
more
aggressive
more
levelling
and
vulgarizing
if
that
be
possible
than
it
ever
had
been
before
by
midsummer
adams
was
more
convinced
than
in
that
the
political
controversy
in
england
had
an
important
bearing
on
the
attitude
toward
america
even
the
alleged
neutrality
of
seemed
turning
to
presentation
of
the
lesson
of
america
mill
defence
of
the
north
appearing
in
the
february
number
was
soon
followed
in
july
by
the
first
of
a
series
of
articles
universal
suffrage
in
the
united
states
and
its
consequences
depicting
the
war
as
the
result
of
mob
rule
and
predicting
a
military
despotism
as
its
inevitable
consequence
the
liberals
were
losing
strength
wrote
adams
that
the
american
difficulties
have
materially
contributed
to
this
result
can
not
be
doubted
the
fact
that
many
of
the
leading
liberals
are
the
declared
friends
of
the
united
states
is
a
decided
disadvantage
in
the
contest
now
going
on
the
predominating
passion
here
is
the
desire
for
the
ultimate
subdivision
of
america
into
many
separate
states
which
will
neutralize
each
other
this
is
most
visible
among
the
conservative
class
of
the
aristocracy
who
dread
the
growth
of
liberal
opinions
and
who
habitually
regard
america
as
the
nursery
of
them
from
all
this
controversy
government
leaders
kept
carefully
aloof
at
least
in
public
expression
of
opinion
privately
russell
commented
to
palmerston
i
have
been
reading
a
book
on
jefferson
by
de
witt
which
is
both
interesting
and
instructive
it
shows
how
the
great
republic
of
washington
degenerated
into
the
democracy
of
jefferson
they
are
now
reaping
the
fruit
was
it
mere
coincidence
or
was
there
significance
in
an
editorial
in
palmerston
alleged
organ
the
that
any
englishman
has
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
calamities
of
america
is
notoriously
and
demonstrably
false
but
we
have
no
hesitation
in
admitting
that
many
thoughtful
englishmen
who
have
watched
in
the
policy
of
the
united
states
during
the
last
twenty
years
the
foreshadowing
of
a
democratic
tyranny
compared
with
which
the
most
corrupt
despotisms
of
the
old
world
appear
realms
of
idyllic
happiness
and
peace
have
gratefully
recognized
the
finger
of
providence
in
the
strife
by
which
they
have
been
so
frightfully
rent
asunder
in
october
the
heavy
artillery
of
the
conservatives
was
again
brought
into
action
and
this
time
with
more
explicit
diagnosis
than
heretofore
for
a
great
number
of
years
said
the
a
certain
party
among
us
great
admirers
of
america
have
chosen
to
fight
their
english
battles
upon
american
soil
now
the
american
government
has
disgracefully
and
ignominiously
failed
at
all
points
it
is
evident
that
political
equality
is
not
merely
a
folly
it
is
a
chimera
at
last
in
november
the
openly
took
the
position
which
its
accusers
declared
to
have
been
the
basis
of
its
editorial
utterances
almost
from
the
beginning
of
the
civil
war
these
are
the
consequences
of
a
cheap
and
simple
form
of
government
having
a
rural
attorney
for
sovereign
and
a
city
attorney
for
prime
minister
we
have
already
said
that
if
such
a
terrible
exposure
of
incapacity
had
happened
in
england
we
should
at
the
earliest
moment
possible
have
sent
the
incapables
about
their
business
and
put
ourselves
in
the
hands
of
better
men
this
republic
has
been
so
often
proposed
to
us
as
a
model
for
imitation
that
we
should
be
unpardonable
not
to
mark
how
it
works
now
when
for
the
first
time
it
has
some
work
to
do
we
believe
that
if
the
english
system
of
parliamentary
action
had
existed
in
america
the
war
could
not
have
occurred
but
we
are
quite
sure
that
such
ministers
would
have
long
since
been
changed
in
addition
to
a
conservative
ringing
the
changes
upon
the
failure
of
democracy
the
open
friends
of
the
south
dilated
also
upon
the
gentlemanly
characteristics
of
southern
leaders
and
society
this
was
the
frequent
burden
of
articles
in
in
the
early
weeks
of
its
publication
to
this
was
soon
added
a
picture
of
northern
democracy
as
composed
of
and
controlled
by
the
immigrant
element
which
was
the
source
of
the
enormous
increase
of
population
in
the
last
thirty
years
from
revolutionary
areas
in
europe
germans
hungarians
irish
carried
with
them
more
than
their
strong
arms
they
imported
also
their
theories
of
equality
the
revolutionary
party
which
represents
them
is
at
this
moment
master
in
the
states
of
the
north
where
it
is
indulging
in
all
its
customary
licence
this
fact
complained
was
not
sufficiently
brought
out
in
the
english
press
very
different
was
the
picture
painted
by
anthony
trollope
after
a
tour
of
the
western
states
this
man
has
his
romance
his
high
poetic
feeling
and
above
all
his
manly
dignity
visit
him
and
you
will
find
him
without
coat
or
waistcoat
unshorn
in
ragged
blue
trousers
and
old
flannel
shirt
too
often
bearing
on
his
lantern
jaws
the
signs
of
ague
and
sickness
but
he
will
stand
upright
before
you
and
speak
to
you
with
all
the
ease
of
a
lettered
gentleman
in
his
own
library
all
the
odious
incivility
of
the
republican
servant
has
been
banished
he
is
his
own
master
standing
on
his
own
threshold
and
finds
no
need
to
assert
his
equality
by
rudeness
he
is
delighted
to
see
you
and
bids
you
sit
down
on
his
battered
bench
without
dreaming
of
any
such
apology
as
an
english
cotter
offers
to
a
lady
bountiful
when
she
calls
he
has
worked
out
his
independence
and
shows
it
in
every
easy
movement
of
his
body
he
tells
you
of
it
unconsciously
in
every
tone
of
his
voice
you
will
always
find
in
his
cabin
some
newspaper
some
book
some
token
of
advance
in
education
when
he
questions
you
about
the
old
country
he
astonishes
you
by
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
i
defy
you
not
to
feel
that
he
is
superior
to
the
race
from
whence
he
has
sprung
in
england
or
in
ireland
it
is
always
the
same
story
with
us
there
is
no
level
of
society
men
stand
on
a
long
staircase
but
the
crowd
congregates
near
the
bottom
and
the
lower
steps
are
very
broad
in
america
men
stand
upon
a
common
platform
but
the
platform
is
raised
above
the
ground
though
it
does
not
approach
in
height
the
top
of
our
staircase
if
we
take
the
average
altitude
in
the
two
countries
we
shall
find
that
the
american
heads
are
the
more
elevated
of
the
two
a
comparison
of
dates
shows
that
the
unanimity
of
conservative
and
aristocratic
expression
on
the
failure
of
american
democracy
and
its
lesson
to
england
was
most
marked
and
most
open
at
the
moment
when
the
government
was
seriously
considering
an
offer
of
mediation
in
the
war
meanwhile
the
emancipation
proclamation
of
september
had
appeared
it
did
not
immediately
affect
governmental
attitude
save
adversely
to
the
north
and
it
gave
a
handle
for
outcry
on
the
score
of
a
servile
war
indeed
the
radicals
were
at
first
depressed
by
it
but
when
months
passed
with
no
appearance
of
a
servile
war
and
when
the
second
emancipation
proclamation
of
january
further
certified
the
moral
purpose
of
the
north
a
great
element
of
strength
was
added
to
the
english
advocates
of
democracy
the
numerous
addresses
to
lincoln
exhibited
both
a
revived
moral
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
of
and
were
frequently
combined
with
a
laudation
of
american
political
institutions
the
great
at
exeter
hall
january
was
described
by
the
correspondent
of
an
american
paper
as
largely
deriving
its
strength
from
the
universal
dissatisfaction
of
the
lower
orders
of
the
english
people
with
their
existing
conditions
under
the
crown
the
descendants
of
the
roundhead
commoners
chafing
under
the
limitations
of
the
franchise
burdensome
taxation
the
contempt
with
which
they
are
regarded
by
the
lords
of
the
soil
the
grievous
effects
of
the
laws
of
entail
and
primogeniture
whereby
they
are
kept
poor
and
rendered
liable
to
starvation
and
pauperism
these
have
looked
to
america
as
the
model
democracy
which
proves
the
poor
man
capacity
for
the
meeting
was
called
for
seven
but
at
half
after
five
the
hall
was
filled
and
at
six
crowded
a
second
hall
was
filled
and
outdoor
meetings
of
two
thousand
people
organized
in
exeter
street
all
england
was
up
in
arms
not
so
much
against
slavery
as
against
british
oligarchy
the
correspondent
further
reported
rumours
that
this
meeting
had
caused
anxious
consideration
to
the
managers
of
the
and
the
decision
to
step
more
warily
no
doubt
this
was
exaggeration
of
the
political
character
and
effect
of
the
meeting
but
certain
it
is
that
the
political
element
was
present
joining
hands
with
enthusiasm
also
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
last
confident
and
vigorous
expression
of
the
failure
of
democracy
from
sources
professedly
neutral
appeared
immediately
after
the
james
hall
meeting
but
was
necessarily
written
before
that
meeting
took
place
in
its
issue
of
february
declared
as
before
every
sensible
man
in
this
country
now
acknowledges
that
we
have
already
gone
as
far
toward
democracy
as
is
safe
to
go
this
is
the
great
moral
benefit
which
we
have
derived
from
the
events
in
america
john
blackwood
was
an
intimate
friend
of
delane
editor
of
the
holding
similar
views
on
political
questions
but
the
was
suddenly
grown
cautious
in
reading
english
political
lessons
from
america
in
truth
attack
now
rested
with
the
radicals
and
bright
oratory
was
in
great
demand
he
now
advanced
from
the
defensive
position
of
laudation
of
the
north
to
the
offensive
one
of
attacking
the
southern
aristocracy
not
merely
because
it
wished
to
perpetuate
african
slavery
but
because
it
desired
to
make
all
the
as
subservient
to
it
as
was
the
negro
it
was
now
radical
purpose
to
keep
the
battle
raging
and
they
were
succeeding
bigelow
believed
that
the
united
states
might
well
recognize
its
opportunity
in
this
controversy
and
give
aid
to
its
friends
after
all
this
struggle
of
ours
both
at
home
and
abroad
is
but
a
struggle
between
the
principle
of
popular
government
and
government
by
a
privileged
class
the
people
therefore
all
the
world
over
are
in
a
species
of
solidarity
which
it
is
our
duty
and
interest
to
cultivate
to
the
utmost
but
adams
gave
contrary
advice
wholly
sympathetic
with
the
democratic
movement
in
england
as
now
somewhat
to
his
surprise
developed
he
yet
feared
that
the
extremes
to
which
bright
and
others
were
going
in
support
of
the
north
might
create
unfortunate
reactions
in
the
government
especially
he
was
anxious
that
the
united
states
should
not
offer
opportunity
for
accusation
of
interference
in
a
british
political
quarrel
it
is
noteworthy
that
while
many
addresses
to
lincoln
were
forwarded
by
him
and
many
were
printed
in
the
annual
publication
of
diplomatic
correspondence
those
that
thus
appeared
dealt
almost
exclusively
with
emancipation
yet
adams
was
also
forwarding
addresses
and
speeches
harping
on
american
democracy
a
meeting
at
edinburgh
february
found
place
in
its
emancipation
aspect
in
the
united
states
documents
but
the
burden
of
that
meeting
democracy
did
not
it
was
there
proclaimed
that
the
british
press
misrepresented
conditions
in
america
because
the
future
of
free
political
institutions
as
sketched
in
the
american
declaration
of
independence
and
in
the
state
constitutions
of
the
northern
states
would
be
a
standing
argument
against
the
expansion
of
the
franchise
and
the
enjoyment
of
just
political
rights
among
us
as
well
as
a
convenient
argument
in
favour
of
the
continued
domination
of
our
aristocratic
parties
the
tide
of
democratic
feeling
was
rising
rapidly
in
england
on
march
adams
wrote
to
seward
of
a
recent
debate
in
parliament
that
that
body
was
much
more
judicious
in
expressions
on
america
than
it
had
been
before
it
will
not
escape
your
observation
that
the
question
is
now
felt
to
be
taking
a
shape
which
was
scarcely
anticipated
by
the
managers
of
the
when
they
first
undertook
to
guide
the
british
mind
to
the
overthrow
of
free
institutions
in
america
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
this
was
written
there
occurred
the
greatest
most
outspoken
and
most
denunciatory
to
the
aristocracy
of
the
meetings
held
to
support
the
cause
of
the
north
this
was
the
spectacular
gathering
of
the
trades
unions
of
london
at
james
hall
on
march
usually
regarded
as
the
culminating
effort
in
bright
tour
of
england
for
the
cause
of
democracy
but
whose
origin
is
somewhat
shrouded
in
mystery
socialist
tradition
claims
that
karl
marx
conceived
the
idea
of
the
meeting
and
was
responsible
for
its
organization
the
press
generally
reported
it
as
a
bright
meeting
adams
wrote
to
seward
of
the
pressure
put
on
him
by
professor
beesly
of
the
university
of
london
to
send
a
representative
from
the
american
ministry
beesly
expanding
upon
the
importance
and
high
standing
of
the
trades
unions
to
this
adams
demurred
but
finally
sent
his
son
to
sit
in
the
audience
and
report
the
proceedings
whatever
its
origin
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
was
the
most
important
of
all
meetings
held
in
england
during
the
civil
war
nor
that
its
keynote
was
america
fighting
the
battle
of
democracy
save
for
some
distinguished
speakers
those
in
attendance
consisted
almost
wholly
of
three
thousand
picked
representatives
of
the
trades
unions
of
london
adams
transmitted
to
seward
his
son
report
of
the
meeting
its
character
composition
names
of
speakers
and
their
emphatic
expressions
of
friendship
for
the
north
but
it
is
again
noteworthy
that
henry
adams
clear
analysis
of
the
real
significance
of
the
meeting
was
not
printed
in
the
published
diplomatic
correspondence
giving
due
praise
to
the
speeches
of
bright
and
beesly
and
commenting
on
press
assertions
that
the
extraordinary
numbers
there
were
only
brought
together
by
their
curiosity
to
hear
mr
bright
henry
adams
continued
that
this
was
not
the
case
must
have
been
evident
to
every
person
present
in
fact
it
was
only
after
he
closed
that
the
real
business
of
the
evening
began
then
followed
speeches
and
the
introduction
of
resolutions
by
howell
a
bricklayer
odgers
a
shoemaker
mantz
a
compositor
cremer
a
joiner
who
was
bitter
against
lord
palmerston
conolly
a
mason
and
other
labouring
men
all
asserting
that
the
success
of
free
institutions
in
america
was
a
political
question
of
deep
consequence
in
england
and
that
they
would
not
tolerate
any
interference
unfavourable
to
the
north
no
one
the
report
emphasized
could
doubt
what
was
intended
the
meeting
was
a
demonstration
of
democratic
strength
and
no
concealment
of
this
fact
was
made
if
it
did
not
have
a
direct
political
bearing
on
internal
politics
in
england
it
needed
little
of
doing
so
there
was
not
even
a
profession
of
faith
in
the
government
of
england
as
at
present
constituted
every
hostile
allusion
to
the
aristocracy
the
church
the
opinions
of
the
classes
was
received
with
warm
cheers
every
allusion
to
the
republican
institutions
of
america
the
right
of
suffrage
the
right
of
the
of
republican
influence
was
caught
up
by
the
audience
with
vehement
applause
it
may
therefore
be
considered
as
fairly
and
authoritatively
announced
that
the
class
of
skilled
workmen
in
london
that
is
the
leaders
of
the
pure
popular
movement
in
england
have
announced
by
an
act
almost
without
precedent
in
their
history
the
principle
that
they
make
common
cause
with
the
americans
who
are
struggling
for
the
restoration
of
the
union
and
that
all
their
power
and
influence
shall
be
used
on
behalf
of
the
north
bright
words
of
most
scarifying
indictment
of
privilege
and
his
appeal
to
workers
to
join
hands
with
their
fellows
in
america
have
been
given
in
a
previous
chapter
evidently
that
appeal
though
enthusiastically
received
for
its
oratorical
brilliance
was
unneeded
his
was
but
an
eloquent
expression
of
that
which
was
in
the
minds
of
his
audience
upon
the
american
minister
the
effect
was
to
cause
him
to
renew
warnings
against
showing
too
keen
an
appreciation
of
the
support
of
political
radicalism
in
england
the
meeting
he
wrote
had
at
once
stirred
anxiety
in
parliament
and
verged
much
too
closely
upon
the
minatory
in
the
domestic
politics
of
this
kingdom
to
make
it
easy
to
recognize
or
sympathize
with
by
foreign
governments
hence
it
seems
to
me
of
the
greatest
consequence
that
the
treatment
of
all
present
questions
between
the
two
nations
should
be
regulated
by
a
provident
forecast
of
what
may
follow
it
the
political
struggle
in
england
hereafter
i
am
not
sure
that
some
parties
here
would
not
now
be
willing
even
to
take
the
risk
of
a
war
in
order
the
more
effectually
to
turn
the
scale
against
us
and
thus
as
they
think
to
crush
the
rising
spirit
of
their
own
population
that
this
is
only
a
feeling
at
present
and
has
not
yet
risen
to
the
dignity
of
a
policy
may
be
true
enough
but
that
does
not
the
less
impose
upon
the
government
at
home
a
duty
so
to
shape
its
actions
as
if
possible
to
defeat
all
such
calculations
and
dissipate
such
hopes
we
owe
this
duty
not
less
to
the
great
body
of
those
who
in
this
kingdom
are
friends
to
us
and
our
institutions
than
to
ourselves
illustration
john
bright
a
photograph
taken
of
him
in
the
attitude
in
which
he
usually
trevelyan
life
of
john
thus
adams
advised
his
government
to
tread
lightly
in
respect
to
democratic
agitation
in
england
over
a
month
later
he
received
a
deputation
headed
by
bright
come
to
present
to
him
the
resolutions
passed
at
the
trades
unions
meeting
the
deputation
expressed
fears
that
a
rupture
was
imminent
in
the
relations
of
great
britain
and
america
and
that
this
would
have
a
disastrous
influence
on
the
aspirations
of
europe
adams
replied
in
general
terms
of
appreciation
for
the
sympathies
expressed
by
the
meeting
but
carefully
avoided
specific
comment
on
its
democratic
purpose
he
was
too
prudent
said
the
in
reporting
the
deputation
to
appraise
the
importance
of
the
particular
demonstration
to
which
his
notice
was
invited
and
his
reply
was
given
favourable
comment
this
reply
wrote
adams
appears
to
have
had
a
sedative
effect
meanwhile
bright
continued
his
preachment
to
the
english
people
though
modifying
his
tone
of
fierce
accusation
against
privilege
and
confining
himself
to
declaring
the
interest
of
the
unenfranchised
in
the
american
conflict
in
a
speech
before
the
union
and
emancipation
society
of
london
on
june
he
asserted
for
the
twenty
millions
of
people
in
this
country
as
yet
without
representation
in
parliament
i
say
that
these
have
an
interest
almost
as
great
and
direct
as
though
they
were
living
in
massachusetts
or
new
york
in
the
tremendous
struggle
for
freedom
which
is
now
shaking
the
whole
north
american
continent
like
utterances
were
repeated
at
further
public
meetings
and
so
insistent
were
they
as
to
require
reply
by
the
conservative
faction
even
if
as
was
supposed
the
effect
of
the
trades
union
attitude
had
been
to
give
a
halt
to
the
vehemence
of
those
who
had
been
sounding
the
lesson
of
american
failure
in
democracy
bright
became
the
centre
of
attack
the
led
his
is
a
political
fanaticism
he
used
to
idolize
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
the
one
great
dominant
democracy
of
the
world
he
believes
in
it
still
and
if
it
must
go
he
is
ready
to
idolize
its
memory
for
this
he
gives
up
all
his
most
cherished
notions
and
all
his
less
absorbing
principles
yet
mr
bright
is
consistent
he
has
one
master
passion
and
his
breast
capacious
as
it
is
can
hold
no
more
that
master
passion
is
the
love
of
that
great
dominant
democracy
he
worshipped
it
while
rising
to
its
culminating
point
and
he
is
obliged
to
turn
right
round
to
worship
it
while
setting
he
did
not
himself
know
until
tested
by
this
great
trial
how
entirely
his
opinions
as
to
war
and
peace
and
slavery
and
freedom
and
lust
of
conquest
and
hatred
of
oppression
were
all
the
mere
accidents
which
hung
loosely
upon
him
and
were
capable
of
being
detached
at
once
in
the
interest
of
the
ruling
passion
of
his
soul
for
that
great
dominant
democracy
nor
need
we
wonder
for
if
that
great
democracy
has
been
a
failure
then
men
will
say
that
the
life
of
john
bright
up
to
this
time
has
been
but
a
foolish
dream
evidently
bright
speeches
were
causing
anxiety
and
bitterness
but
an
if
had
crept
into
the
estimate
of
the
future
of
american
democracy
caused
less
by
the
progress
of
the
war
than
by
the
rising
excitement
of
democratic
england
the
editorial
just
quoted
appeared
when
the
faith
was
generally
professed
that
lee
was
about
to
end
the
war
through
the
invasion
of
pennsylvania
in
the
reaction
created
by
the
arrival
of
the
news
of
gettysburg
and
vicksburg
adams
still
again
warned
his
government
against
either
a
belligerent
or
interfering
attitude
toward
great
britain
but
stated
plainly
that
northern
victory
was
of
supreme
importance
in
europe
itself
we
have
a
mission
to
fulfill
it
is
to
show
by
our
example
to
the
people
of
england
in
particular
and
to
all
nations
in
general
the
value
of
republican
institutions
there
was
still
a
general
belief
in
the
incompetency
of
those
institutions
the
greatest
triumph
of
all
would
be
to
prove
these
calculations
vain
in
comparison
with
this
what
would
be
the
gain
to
be
derived
from
any
collision
with
the
powers
of
europe
it
is
strange
that
with
so
a
division
of
english
opinion
on
american
democracy
few
in
america
itself
appreciated
the
significance
of
the
british
controversy
forbes
who
had
been
on
a
special
mission
to
england
wrote
to
lincoln
on
his
return
our
friends
abroad
see
it
john
bright
and
his
glorious
band
of
english
republicans
see
that
we
are
fighting
for
democracy
or
to
get
rid
of
the
technical
name
for
liberal
institutions
the
democrats
and
the
liberals
of
the
old
world
are
as
much
and
as
heartily
with
us
as
any
supporters
we
have
on
this
side
our
enemies
too
see
it
in
the
same
light
the
aristocrats
and
the
despots
of
the
old
world
see
that
our
quarrel
is
that
of
the
people
against
an
aristocracy
but
there
are
few
similar
expressions
and
these
few
nearly
always
came
from
men
who
had
been
abroad
and
had
thus
come
into
direct
contact
with
british
political
movements
meanwhile
lee
retreat
from
pennsylvania
had
produced
a
like
retreat
in
the
opinions
on
the
failure
of
democracy
earlier
confidently
held
by
the
professedly
neutral
press
in
september
having
arrived
at
the
point
by
the
usual
process
of
gradually
facing
about
the
was
bold
enough
to
deny
that
england
had
any
personal
feeling
or
concern
about
democracy
in
america
or
that
this
had
anything
to
do
with
english
attitude
on
the
war
thenceforth
neither
the
nor
any
of
the
leading
papers
saw
fit
to
revive
with
vigour
the
cry
of
democracy
failure
no
matter
how
persistent
in
proclaiming
ultimate
victory
for
the
south
aristocratic
exultation
had
given
place
to
alarm
and
it
seemed
wiser
if
possible
to
quiet
the
issue
not
so
the
radicals
who
made
every
effort
to
keep
the
issue
alive
in
the
minds
of
the
british
public
and
whose
leaders
with
less
violence
but
increased
firmness
debated
the
question
in
every
public
meeting
favourable
to
the
north
many
conservatives
adams
reported
were
now
anxiously
sitting
on
the
fence
yet
finding
the
posture
a
difficult
one
because
of
their
irritation
at
bright
taunts
bright
star
was
rising
the
very
moment
the
war
comes
to
an
end
wrote
adams
and
a
restoration
of
the
union
follows
it
will
be
the
signal
for
a
reaction
that
will
make
mr
bright
perhaps
the
most
formidable
public
man
in
england
the
continuation
of
the
controversy
was
not
however
wholly
in
the
silence
of
the
daily
press
it
seemed
incumbent
upon
the
more
eager
and
professed
friends
of
the
south
to
take
up
the
cudgels
hence
in
part
came
the
organization
of
the
southern
independence
association
and
the
attempt
to
hold
public
meetings
favourable
to
the
south
in
the
early
months
of
much
talk
had
been
spent
on
the
british
issue
involved
in
the
war
there
was
now
to
be
vigorous
work
to
secure
it
index
into
vigorous
denunciation
of
the
manchester
school
which
for
convenience
and
truth
we
had
better
for
the
future
call
the
american
school
even
the
government
was
attacked
for
its
complacence
under
the
american
danger
and
for
retaining
as
a
member
who
in
a
recent
speech
had
shown
that
he
shared
bright
views
on
democracy
that
gentleman
bright
could
not
be
asked
to
enter
the
cabinet
in
person
the
country
abhorred
him
parliament
despised
him
his
inveterate
habits
of
slander
and
vituperation
his
vulgarity
and
his
incurable
want
of
veracity
had
made
him
so
hateful
to
the
educated
classes
that
it
would
have
required
no
common
courage
to
give
him
office
his
insolent
sneers
at
royalty
would
have
made
his
appointment
little
less
than
a
personal
insult
to
the
queen
and
his
bad
temper
would
have
made
him
an
intolerable
colleague
in
the
council
but
mr
bright
had
another
self
a
faithful
shadow
which
had
no
ideas
no
soul
no
other
existence
but
what
it
borrowed
from
him
while
its
previous
life
and
education
had
accustomed
it
to
the
society
of
statesmen
and
of
gentlemen
such
expressions
gained
nothing
for
the
conservative
cause
they
were
too
evidently
the
result
of
alarm
at
the
progress
of
radical
and
sentiment
goldwin
smith
in
a
letter
to
the
southern
independence
association
analysed
with
clarity
the
situation
answering
criticisms
of
the
passionate
mob
spirit
of
northern
press
and
people
he
accused
the
of
having
pandered
to
the
hatred
of
america
among
the
upper
classes
of
this
country
during
the
present
war
some
of
us
at
least
had
been
taught
by
what
we
have
lately
seen
not
to
shrink
from
an
extension
of
the
suffrage
if
the
only
bad
consequence
of
that
measure
of
justice
would
be
a
change
in
government
from
the
passions
of
the
privileged
class
to
the
passions
of
the
people
history
will
not
mistake
the
meaning
of
the
loud
cry
of
triumph
which
burst
from
the
hearts
of
all
who
openly
or
secretly
hated
liberty
and
progress
at
the
fall
as
they
fondly
supposed
of
the
great
republic
british
working
men
are
for
the
most
part
as
well
aware
that
the
cause
of
those
who
are
fighting
for
the
right
of
labour
is
theirs
as
any
nobleman
in
your
association
can
be
that
the
other
cause
in
his
the
question
of
democracy
as
a
political
philosophy
and
as
an
institution
for
great
britain
was
by
rapidly
coming
to
the
front
in
politics
this
was
very
largely
a
result
of
the
american
civil
war
roebuck
after
the
failure
of
his
effort
for
mediation
in
was

arnold
in
characterized
the
rule
of
aristocracy
as
inevitably
passing
but
bent
his
thought
to
the
discovery
of
some
middle
ground
or
method
some
influence
which
may
help
us
to
prevent
the
english
people
from
becoming
with
the
growth
of
democracy
there
is
no
longer
any
sort
of
disguise
maintained
wrote
adams
as
to
the
wishes
of
the
privileged
classes
very
little
genuine
sympathy
is
entertained
for
the
rebels
the
true
motive
is
apparent
enough
it
is
the
fear
of
the
spread
of
democratic
feeling
at
home
in
the
event
of
our
success
the
year
had
witnessed
a
rapid
retreat
by
wiser
conservative
elements
in
proclaming
the
lesson
of
american
democracy
a
retreat
caused
by
alarm
at
the
vigour
with
which
radicals
had
taken
up
the
challenge
conservative
hopes
were
still
fixed
upon
southern
success
and
conservative
confidence
loudly
voiced
even
the
pride
of
the
in
the
accuracy
of
its
news
and
in
its
military
forecasts
was
subordinated
to
the
purpose
of
keeping
up
the
courage
of
the
faction
it
represented
small
wonder
then
that
delane
on
receiving
the
news
of
sherman
arrival
before
savannah
should
be
made
physically
ill
and
write
to
dasent
the
american
news
is
a
heavy
blow
to
us
as
well
as
to
the
south
the
next
day
he
added
i
am
still
sore
vexed
about
sherman
but
chenery
did
his
best
to
attenuate
the
mischief
attenuation
of
northern
progress
in
arms
was
indeed
attempted
but
the
facts
of
the
military
situation
were
too
strong
for
continued
concealment
from
january
only
the
most
stubborn
of
southern
friends
could
remain
blind
to
the
approaching
northern
victory
lord
acton
a
of
the
great
confederate
military
leader
broke
his
heart
over
the
surrender
of
lee
but
was
moved
also
by
keen
insight
as
to
the
political
meaning
of
that
surrender
so
assured
were
all
parties
in
england
that
the
great
civil
war
in
america
was
closing
in
northern
victory
that
the
final
event
was
discounted
in
advance
and
the
lines
were
rapidly
being
formed
for
an
english
political
struggle
on
the
great
issue
heralded
as
involved
in
the
american
conflict
again
on
the
introduction
of
a
motion
in
parliament
for
expansion
of
the
franchise
the
attempted
to
read
a
lesson
from
america
the
for
april
asserted
that
even
yet
the
mass
of
educated
men
in
england
retain
the
sympathy
for
the
south
which
they
have
nourished
ever
since
the
conflict
assumed
a
decided
shape
america
was
plainly
headed
in
the
direction
of
a
military
despotism
her
example
should
warn
england
from
a
move
in
the
same
direction
the
classes
which
govern
this
country
are
in
a
minority
and
should
beware
of
majority
rule
but
events
discredited
the
prophecy
of
a
military
despotism
the
assassination
of
lincoln
gave
opportunity
not
merely
for
a
general
outpouring
of
expressions
of
sympathy
but
also
to
the
radicals
a
chance
to
exalt
lincoln
leadership
in
democracy
in
july
great
britain
was
holding
elections
for
a
new
parliament
not
a
single
member
who
had
supported
the
cause
of
the
north
failed
of
several
additional
northern
friends
were
chosen
and
some
outspoken
members
for
the
south
were
defeated
adams
thought
this
a
matter
deserving
special
notice
in
america
and
prophesied
a
new
era
approaching
in
england
as
it
is
i
can
not
resist
the
belief
that
this
period
marks
an
era
in
the
political
movement
of
great
britain
pure
conservatism
has
so
far
lost
its
hold
on
the
confidence
of
the
country
that
it
will
not
appear
in
that
guise
any
more
unless
some
new
and
foreign
element
should
interpose
i
look
for
decided
progress
in
enlarging
the
popular
features
of
the
constitution
and
diminishing
the
influence
of
the
aristocracy
it
is
impossible
not
to
perceive
traces
of
the
influence
of
our
institutions
upon
all
these
changes
the
progress
of
the
liberal
cause
not
in
england
alone
but
all
over
the
world
is
in
a
measure
in
our
hands
the
liberal
progress
was
more
rapid
even
than
adams
anticipated
palmerston
ill
for
some
months
past
died
on
october
russell
succeeded
him
as
head
of
the
ministry
and
almost
immediately
declared
himself
in
favour
of
parliamentary
reform
even
though
a
majority
in
both
houses
was
still
opposed
to
such
a
measure
russell
desertion
of
his
earlier
attitude
of
finality
on
franchise
expansion
correctly
represented
the
acceptance
though
unwillingly
by
both
political
parties
of
the
necessity
of
reform
the
battle
long
waged
but
reaching
its
decisive
moment
during
the
american
civil
war
had
finally
gone
against
conservatism
when
lee
surrendered
at
appomatox
reform
bill
of
was
defeated
by
tory
opposition
in
combination
with
a
small
whig
faction
which
refused
to
desert
the
principle
of
aristocratic
government
the
government
by
the
wise
but
the
tories
who
came
into
power
under
derby
were
forced
by
the
popular
demand
voiced
even
to
the
point
of
rioting
themselves
to
present
a
reform
bill
disraeli
measure
introduced
with
a
number
of
fancy
franchises
which
in
effect
sought
to
counteract
the
giving
of
the
vote
to
british
was
quickly
subjected
to
such
caustic
criticism
that
all
the
planned
advantages
to
conservatism
were
soon
thrown
overboard
and
a
bill
presented
so
radical
as
to
permit
a
transfer
of
political
power
to
the
working
classes
the
reform
bill
of
changed
great
britain
from
a
government
by
aristocracy
to
one
by
democracy
a
new
nation
came
into
being
the
friends
of
the
north
had
triumphed
thus
in
addition
to
the
play
of
diplomatic
incidents
the
incidental
frictions
the
effect
on
trade
relations
the
applications
of
british
neutrality
and
the
general
policy
of
the
government
there
existed
for
great
britain
a
great
issue
in
the
outcome
of
the
civil
war
the
issue
of
the
adoption
of
democratic
institutions
it
affected
at
every
turn
british
public
attitude
creating
an
intensity
and
bitterness
of
tone
on
both
sides
unexampled
in
the
expressions
of
a
neutral
people
in
america
this
was
little
understood
and
american
writers
both
during
the
war
and
long
afterwards
gave
little
attention
to
it
immediately
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
war
goldwin
smith
whose
words
during
the
conflict
were
bitter
toward
the
aristocracy
declared
that
the
territorial
aristocracy
of
this
country
and
the
clergy
of
the
established
church
would
have
been
excusable
if
they
could
only
have
said
frankly
that
they
desired
the
downfall
of
institutions
opposed
to
their
own
instead
of
talking
about
their
sympathy
for
the
weak
and
their
respect
for
national
independence
and
their
anxiety
for
the
triumph
of
free
trade
this
was
stated
before
the
democratic
hope
in
england
had
been
realized
three
years
later
the
same
staunch
friend
of
the
north
now
removed
to
america
and
occupying
a
chair
of
history
at
cornell
university
wrote
of
the
british
aristocracy
in
excuse
of
their
attitude
i
fought
these
men
hard
i
believed
and
believe
now
that
their
defeat
was
essential
to
the
progress
of
civilization
but
i
daresay
we
should
have
done
pretty
much
as
they
did
if
we
had
been
born
members
of
a
privileged
order
instead
of
being
brought
up
under
the
blessed
influence
of
equality
and
justice
such
judgment
and
such
excuses
will
appear
to
the
historian
as
but
to
americans
who
conceived
the
civil
war
as
one
fought
first
of
all
for
the
preservation
of
the
nation
the
issue
of
democracy
in
england
seemed
of
little
moment
and
little
to
excuse
either
the
cold
neutrality
of
the
government
or
the
tone
of
the
press
to
americans
great
britain
appeared
friendly
to
the
dissolution
of
the
union
and
the
destruction
of
a
rival
power
nationality
was
the
issue
for
the
north
that
democracy
was
an
issue
in
america
was
denied
nor
could
it
in
the
intensity
of
the
conflict
be
conceived
as
the
vital
question
determining
british
attitude
the
reform
bill
of
brought
a
new
british
nation
into
existence
the
nation
decrying
american
institutions
was
dead
and
a
sister
democracy
holding
out
hands
to
the
united
states
had
replaced
it
but
to
this
the
men
who
had
won
the
war
for
the
north
long
remained
blind
not
during
the
generation
when
americans
immersed
in
a
life
and
death
struggle
for
national
existence
felt
that
he
who
is
not
for
me
is
against
me
could
the
generally
correct
neutrality
of
the
british
government
and
the
support
of
radical
england
be
accepted
at
their
true
value
to
the
north
for
nearly
half
a
century
after
the
american
civil
war
the
natural
sentiments
of
friendship
based
upon
ties
of
blood
and
a
common
heritage
of
literature
and
history
and
law
were
distorted
