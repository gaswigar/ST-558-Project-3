the
land
god
forgot
the
lonely
sunsets
flare
forlorn
down
valleys
dreadly
desolate
the
lordly
mountains
soar
in
scorn
as
still
as
death
as
stern
as
fate
lonely
sunsets
flame
and
die
the
giant
valleys
gulp
the
night
the
monster
mountains
scrape
the
sky
where
eager
stars
are
so
gaunt
against
the
gibbous
moon
piercing
the
silence
a
lone
wolf
howls
his
ancient
rune
the
fell
of
the
wild
outcast
land
o
leper
land
let
the
lone
all
express
the
hate
insensate
of
thy
hand
thy
heart
abysmal
contents
with
first
lines
the
land
god
forgot
the
lonely
sunsets
flare
forlorn
the
spell
of
the
yukon
i
wanted
the
gold
and
i
sought
it
the
heart
of
the
sourdough
there
where
the
mighty
mountains
bare
their
fangs
unto
the
moon
the
three
voices
the
waves
have
a
story
to
tell
me
the
law
of
the
yukon
this
is
the
law
of
the
yukon
and
ever
she
makes
it
plain
the
parson
son
this
is
the
song
of
the
parson
son
as
he
squats
in
his
shack
alone
the
call
of
the
wild
have
you
gazed
on
naked
grandeur
where
there
nothing
else
to
gaze
on
the
lone
trail
ye
who
know
the
lone
trail
fain
would
follow
it
the
pines
we
sleep
in
the
sleep
of
ages
the
bleak
barbarian
pines
the
lure
of
little
voices
there
a
cry
from
out
the
loneliness
oh
listen
honey
listen
the
song
of
the
when
the
long
long
day
is
over
and
the
big
boss
gives
me
my
pay
grin
if
you
up
against
a
bruiser
and
you
getting
knocked
about
the
shooting
of
dan
mcgrew
a
bunch
of
the
boys
were
whooping
it
up
in
the
malamute
saloon
the
cremation
of
sam
mcgee
there
are
strange
things
done
in
the
midnight
sun
my
madonna
i
haled
me
a
woman
from
the
street
unforgotten
i
know
a
garden
where
the
lilies
gleam
the
reckoning
it
fine
to
have
a
in
a
fancy
restaurant
quatrains
one
said
thy
life
is
thine
to
make
or
mar
the
men
that
do
fit
in
there
a
race
of
men
that
do
fit
in
music
in
the
bush
the
dark
pines
she
sees
the
silver
moon
the
rhyme
of
the
remittance
man
there
a
buck
in
the
shadow
of
my
cabin
the
white
this
is
the
up
at
the
mines
when
the
bearded
brutes
come
down
the
little
old
log
cabin
when
a
man
gets
on
his
uppers
in
a
sort
of
town
the
younger
son
if
you
leave
the
gloom
of
london
and
you
seek
a
glowing
land
the
march
of
the
dead
the
cruel
war
was
over
oh
the
triumph
was
so
sweet
fighting
mac
a
pistol
shot
rings
round
and
round
the
world
the
woman
and
the
angel
an
angel
was
tired
of
heaven
as
he
lounged
in
the
golden
street
the
rhyme
of
the
restless
ones
we
could
sit
and
study
for
the
law
new
year
eve
it
cruel
cold
on
the
silent
and
dark
and
drear
comfort
say
you
struck
a
heap
of
trouble
the
harpy
there
was
a
woman
and
she
was
wise
woefully
wise
was
she
premonition
was
a
year
ago
and
the
moon
was
bright
the
tramps
can
you
recall
dear
comrade
when
we
tramped
god
land
together
you
who
have
lived
in
the
land
the
spell
of
the
yukon
i
wanted
the
gold
and
i
sought
it
i
scrabbled
and
mucked
like
a
slave
was
it
famine
or
scurvy
i
fought
it
i
hurled
my
youth
into
a
grave
i
wanted
the
gold
and
i
got
it
came
out
with
a
fortune
last
fall
yet
somehow
life
not
what
i
thought
it
and
somehow
the
gold
is
all
no
there
the
land
have
you
seen
it
it
the
cussedest
land
that
i
know
from
the
big
dizzy
mountains
that
screen
it
to
the
deep
deathlike
valleys
below
some
say
god
was
tired
when
he
made
it
some
say
it
a
fine
land
to
shun
maybe
but
there
some
as
would
trade
it
for
no
land
on
earth
and
i
one
you
come
to
get
rich
damned
good
reason
you
feel
like
an
exile
at
first
you
hate
it
like
hell
for
a
season
and
then
you
are
worse
than
the
worst
it
grips
you
like
some
kinds
of
sinning
it
twists
you
from
foe
to
a
friend
it
seems
it
been
since
the
beginning
it
seems
it
will
be
to
the
end
i
stood
in
some
hollow
that
of
hush
to
the
brim
i
watched
the
big
husky
sun
wallow
in
crimson
and
gold
and
grow
dim
till
the
moon
set
the
pearly
peaks
gleaming
and
the
stars
tumbled
out
neck
and
crop
and
i
thought
that
i
surely
was
dreaming
with
the
peace
o
the
world
piled
on
top
the
summer
no
sweeter
was
ever
the
sunshiny
woods
all
athrill
the
grayling
aleap
in
the
river
the
bighorn
asleep
on
the
hill
the
strong
life
that
never
knows
harness
the
wilds
where
the
caribou
call
the
freshness
the
freedom
the
farness
o
god
how
i
stuck
on
it
all
the
winter
the
brightness
that
blinds
you
the
white
land
locked
tight
as
a
drum
the
cold
fear
that
follows
and
finds
you
the
silence
that
bludgeons
you
dumb
the
snows
that
are
older
than
history
the
woods
where
the
weird
shadows
slant
the
stillness
the
moonlight
the
mystery
i
bade
but
i
ca
there
a
land
where
the
mountains
are
nameless
and
the
rivers
all
run
god
knows
where
there
are
lives
that
are
erring
and
aimless
and
deaths
that
just
hang
by
a
hair
there
are
hardships
that
nobody
reckons
there
are
valleys
unpeopled
and
still
there
a
land
oh
it
beckons
and
beckons
and
i
want
to
go
back
and
i
will
they
making
my
money
diminish
i
sick
of
the
taste
of
champagne
thank
god
when
i
skinned
to
a
finish
i
pike
to
the
yukon
again
i
fight
and
you
bet
it
no
it
hell
but
i
been
there
before
and
it
better
than
this
by
a
damsite
so
me
for
the
yukon
once
more
there
gold
and
it
haunting
and
haunting
it
luring
me
on
as
of
old
yet
it
is
the
gold
that
i
wanting
so
much
as
just
finding
the
gold
it
the
great
big
broad
land
up
yonder
it
the
forests
where
silence
has
lease
it
the
beauty
that
thrills
me
with
wonder
it
the
stillness
that
fills
me
with
peace
the
heart
of
the
sourdough
there
where
the
mighty
mountains
bare
their
fangs
unto
the
moon
there
where
the
sullen
glare
in
the
bitter
noon
and
the
streams
sweep
down
at
the
clarion
call
of
june
there
where
the
livid
tundras
keep
their
tryst
with
the
tranquil
snows
there
where
the
silences
are
spawned
and
the
light
of
flows
into
the
bowl
of
the
midnight
sky
violet
amber
and
rose
there
where
the
rapids
churn
and
roar
and
the
bellowing
run
where
the
tortured
twisted
rivers
of
blood
rush
to
the
setting
sun
i
packed
my
kit
and
i
going
boys
ere
another
day
is
done
i
knew
it
would
call
or
soon
or
late
as
it
calls
the
whirring
wings
it
the
olden
lure
it
the
golden
lure
it
the
lure
of
the
timeless
things
and
oh
god
of
the
trails
untrod
how
it
whines
in
my
i
sick
to
death
of
your
gods
your
make
believe
and
your
show
i
long
for
a
whiff
of
bacon
and
beans
a
snug
shakedown
in
the
snow
a
trail
to
break
and
a
life
at
stake
and
another
bout
with
the
foe
with
the
wild
that
abhors
all
life
the
wild
that
would
crush
and
rend
i
have
clinched
and
closed
with
the
naked
north
i
have
learned
to
defy
and
defend
shoulder
to
shoulder
we
have
fought
it
out
yet
the
wild
must
win
in
the
end
i
have
flouted
the
wild
i
have
followed
its
lure
fearless
familiar
alone
by
all
that
the
battle
means
and
makes
i
claim
that
land
for
mine
own
yet
the
wild
must
win
and
a
day
will
come
when
i
shall
be
overthrown
then
when
as
fight
we
fought
the
lean
and
i
fought
and
bled
till
the
snows
are
red
under
the
reeling
sky
even
as
lean
goes
down
will
i
go
down
and
die
the
three
voices
the
waves
have
a
story
to
tell
me
as
i
lie
on
the
lonely
beach
chanting
aloft
in
the
the
wind
has
a
lesson
to
teach
but
the
stars
sing
an
anthem
of
glory
i
can
not
put
into
speech
the
waves
tell
of
ocean
spaces
of
hearts
that
are
wild
and
brave
of
populous
city
places
of
desolate
shores
they
lave
of
men
who
sally
in
quest
of
gold
to
sink
in
an
ocean
grave
the
wind
is
a
mighty
roamer
he
bids
me
keep
me
free
clean
from
the
taint
of
the
hardy
and
pure
as
he
cling
with
my
love
to
nature
as
a
child
to
the
but
the
stars
throng
out
in
their
glory
and
they
sing
of
the
god
in
man
they
sing
of
the
mighty
master
of
the
loom
his
fingers
span
where
a
star
or
a
soul
is
a
part
of
the
whole
and
weft
in
the
wondrous
plan
here
by
the
flicker
deep
in
my
blanket
curled
i
long
for
the
peace
of
the
when
the
scroll
of
the
lord
is
unfurled
and
the
wind
and
the
wave
are
silent
and
world
is
singing
to
world
the
law
of
the
yukon
this
is
the
law
of
the
yukon
and
ever
she
makes
it
plain
send
not
your
foolish
and
feeble
send
me
your
strong
and
your
sane
strong
for
the
red
rage
of
battle
sane
for
i
harry
them
sore
send
me
men
girt
for
the
combat
men
who
are
grit
to
the
core
swift
as
the
panther
in
triumph
fierce
as
the
bear
in
defeat
sired
of
a
bulldog
parent
steeled
in
the
furnace
heat
send
me
the
best
of
your
breeding
lend
me
your
chosen
ones
them
will
i
take
to
my
bosom
them
will
i
call
my
sons
them
will
i
gild
with
my
treasure
them
will
i
glut
with
my
meat
but
the
others
the
misfits
the
failures
i
trample
under
my
feet
dissolute
damned
and
despairful
crippled
and
palsied
and
slain
ye
would
send
me
the
spawn
of
your
gutters
go
take
back
your
spawn
again
wild
and
wide
are
my
borders
stern
as
death
is
my
sway
from
my
ruthless
throne
i
have
ruled
alone
for
a
million
years
and
a
day
hugging
my
mighty
treasure
waiting
for
man
to
come
till
he
swept
like
a
turbid
torrent
and
after
him
swept
the
scum
the
pallid
pimp
of
the
the
enervate
of
the
pen
one
by
one
i
weeded
them
out
for
all
that
i
sought
was
men
one
by
one
i
dismayed
them
frighting
them
sore
with
my
glooms
one
by
one
i
betrayed
them
unto
my
manifold
dooms
drowned
them
like
rats
in
my
rivers
starved
them
like
curs
on
my
plains
rotted
the
flesh
that
was
left
them
poisoned
the
blood
in
their
veins
burst
with
my
winter
upon
them
searing
forever
their
sight
lashed
them
with
faces
whimpering
wild
in
the
night
staggering
blind
through
the
stumbling
mad
through
the
snow
frozen
stiff
in
the
brittle
and
bent
like
a
bow
featureless
formless
forsaken
scented
by
wolves
in
their
flight
left
for
the
wind
to
make
music
through
ribs
that
are
glittering
white
gnawing
the
black
crust
of
failure
searching
the
pit
of
despair
crooking
the
toe
in
the
trigger
trying
to
patter
a
prayer
going
outside
with
an
escort
raving
with
lips
all
afoam
writing
a
cheque
for
a
million
driveling
feebly
of
home
lost
like
a
louse
in
the
burning
or
else
in
the
tented
town
seeking
a
drunkard
solace
sinking
and
sinking
down
steeped
in
the
slime
at
the
bottom
dead
to
a
decent
world
lost
the
human
flotsam
far
on
the
frontier
hurled
in
the
camp
at
the
bend
of
the
river
with
its
dozen
saloons
aglare
its
gambling
dens
ariot
its
gramophones
all
ablare
crimped
with
the
crimes
of
a
city
and
bridled
with
lies
in
the
hush
of
my
mountained
vastness
in
the
flush
of
my
midnight
skies
yet
tools
of
my
purpose
so
natheless
i
suffer
them
thrive
crushing
my
weak
in
their
clutches
that
only
my
strong
may
survive
but
the
others
the
men
of
my
mettle
the
men
who
would
my
fame
unto
its
ultimate
issue
winning
me
honor
not
shame
searching
my
uttermost
valleys
fighting
each
step
as
they
go
shooting
the
wrath
of
my
rapids
scaling
my
ramparts
of
snow
ripping
the
guts
of
my
mountains
looting
the
beds
of
my
creeks
them
will
i
take
to
my
bosom
and
speak
as
a
mother
speaks
i
am
the
land
that
listens
i
am
the
land
that
broods
steeped
in
eternal
beauty
crystalline
waters
and
woods
long
have
i
waited
lonely
shunned
as
a
thing
accurst
monstrous
moody
pathetic
the
last
of
the
lands
and
the
first
visioning
at
twilight
sad
with
a
longing
forlorn
feeling
my
womb
with
the
seed
of
cities
unborn
wild
and
wide
are
my
borders
stern
as
death
is
my
sway
and
i
wait
for
the
men
who
will
win
me
and
i
will
not
be
won
in
a
day
and
i
will
not
be
won
by
weaklings
subtle
suave
and
mild
but
by
men
with
the
hearts
of
vikings
and
the
simple
faith
of
a
child
desperate
strong
and
resistless
unthrottled
by
fear
or
defeat
them
will
i
gild
with
my
treasure
them
will
i
glut
with
my
meat
lofty
i
stand
from
each
sister
land
patient
and
wearily
wise
with
the
weight
of
a
world
of
sadness
in
my
quiet
passionless
eyes
dreaming
alone
of
a
people
dreaming
alone
of
a
day
when
men
shall
not
rape
my
riches
and
curse
me
and
go
away
making
a
bawd
of
my
bounty
fouling
the
hand
that
gave
till
i
rise
in
my
wrath
and
i
sweep
on
their
path
and
i
stamp
them
into
a
grave
dreaming
of
men
who
will
bless
me
of
women
esteeming
me
good
of
children
born
in
my
borders
of
radiant
motherhood
of
cities
leaping
to
stature
of
fame
like
a
flag
unfurled
as
i
pour
the
tide
of
my
riches
in
the
eager
lap
of
the
world
this
is
the
law
of
the
yukon
that
only
the
strong
shall
thrive
that
surely
the
weak
shall
perish
and
only
the
fit
survive
dissolute
damned
and
despairful
crippled
and
palsied
and
slain
this
is
the
will
of
the
yukon
lo
how
she
makes
it
plain
the
parson
son
is
the
song
of
the
parson
son
as
he
squats
in
his
shack
alone
on
the
wild
weird
nights
when
the
northern
lights
shoot
up
from
the
frozen
zone
and
it
sixty
below
and
couched
in
the
snow
the
hungry
huskies
moan
i
one
of
the
arctic
brotherhood
i
an
pioneer
i
came
with
the
first
o
god
how
i
cursed
this
yukon
but
still
i
here
i
sweated
athirst
in
its
summer
heat
i
frozen
and
starved
in
its
cold
i
followed
my
dreams
by
its
thousand
streams
i
toiled
and
moiled
for
its
gold
look
at
my
eyes
been
twice
look
where
my
foot
half
gone
and
that
gruesome
scar
on
my
left
cheek
where
the
bit
to
the
bone
each
one
a
brand
of
this
devil
land
where
i
played
and
i
lost
the
game
a
broken
wreck
with
a
craze
for
and
never
a
cent
to
my
name
this
mining
is
only
a
gamble
the
worst
is
as
good
as
the
best
i
was
in
with
the
bunch
and
i
might
have
come
out
right
on
top
with
the
rest
with
cormack
ladue
and
macdonald
o
god
but
it
hell
to
think
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
i
squandered
on
cards
and
women
and
drink
in
the
early
days
we
were
just
a
few
and
we
hunted
and
fished
around
nor
dreamt
by
our
lonely
of
the
wealth
that
lay
under
the
ground
we
traded
in
skins
and
whiskey
and
i
often
slept
under
the
shade
of
that
lone
birch
tree
on
bonanza
where
the
first
big
find
was
made
we
were
just
like
a
great
big
family
and
every
man
had
his
squaw
and
we
lived
such
a
wild
free
fearless
life
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
till
sudden
there
came
a
whisper
and
it
maddened
us
every
man
and
i
got
in
on
bonanza
before
the
big
rush
began
oh
those
dawson
days
and
the
sin
and
the
blaze
and
the
town
all
open
wide
if
god
made
me
in
his
likeness
sure
he
let
the
devil
inside
but
we
all
were
mad
both
the
good
and
the
bad
and
as
for
the
women
well
no
spot
on
the
map
in
so
short
a
space
has
hustled
more
souls
to
hell
money
was
just
like
dirt
there
easy
to
get
and
to
spend
i
was
all
caked
in
on
a
jade
but
she
shook
me
in
the
end
it
put
me
queer
and
for
near
a
year
i
never
drew
sober
breath
till
i
found
myself
in
the
bughouse
ward
with
a
claim
staked
out
on
death
twenty
years
in
the
yukon
struggling
along
its
creeks
roaming
its
giant
valleys
scaling
its
peaks
bathed
in
its
fiery
sunsets
fighting
its
fiendish
cold
twenty
years
in
the
yukon
twenty
years
and
i
old
old
and
weak
but
no
matter
there
in
the
bottle
still
i
hitch
up
the
dogs
and
mush
down
the
trail
to
bill
it
so
long
dark
and
i
lonesome
i
just
lay
down
on
the
bed
i
go
i
guess
i
play
on
the
red
come
kit
your
pony
is
saddled
i
waiting
dear
in
the
court
minnie
you
devil
i
kill
you
if
you
skip
with
that
flossy
sport
how
much
does
it
go
to
the
pan
bill
play
up
school
and
play
the
game
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
was
the
song
of
the
parson
son
as
he
lay
in
his
bunk
alone
ere
the
fire
went
out
and
the
cold
crept
in
and
his
blue
lips
ceased
to
moan
and
the
malamutes
had
torn
him
flesh
from
the
call
of
the
wild
have
you
gazed
on
naked
grandeur
where
there
nothing
else
to
gaze
on
set
pieces
and
scenes
galore
big
mountains
heaved
to
heaven
which
the
blinding
sunsets
blazon
black
canyons
where
the
rapids
rip
and
roar
have
you
swept
the
visioned
valley
with
the
green
stream
streaking
through
it
searched
the
vastness
for
a
something
you
have
lost
have
you
strung
your
soul
to
silence
then
for
god
sake
go
and
do
it
hear
the
challenge
learn
the
lesson
pay
the
cost
have
you
wandered
in
the
wilderness
the
sagebrush
desolation
the
levels
where
the
cattle
graze
have
you
whistled
bits
of
at
the
end
of
all
creation
and
learned
to
know
the
desert
little
ways
have
you
camped
upon
the
foothills
have
you
galloped
the
ranges
have
you
roamed
the
arid
through
and
through
have
you
chummed
up
with
the
mesa
do
you
know
its
moods
and
changes
then
listen
to
the
wild
it
calling
you
have
you
known
the
great
white
silence
not
a
twig
aquiver
eternal
truths
that
shame
our
soothing
lies
have
you
broken
trail
on
snowshoes
mushed
your
huskies
up
the
river
dared
the
unknown
led
the
way
and
clutched
the
prize
have
you
marked
the
map
void
spaces
mingled
with
the
mongrel
races
felt
the
savage
strength
of
brute
in
every
thew
and
though
grim
as
hell
the
worst
is
can
you
round
it
off
with
curses
then
hearken
to
the
wild
it
wanting
you
have
you
suffered
starved
and
triumphed
groveled
down
yet
grasped
at
glory
grown
bigger
in
the
bigness
of
the
whole
done
things
just
for
the
doing
letting
babblers
tell
the
story
seeing
through
the
nice
veneer
the
naked
soul
have
you
seen
god
in
his
splendors
heard
the
text
that
nature
renders
you
never
hear
it
in
the
family
pew
the
simple
things
the
true
things
the
silent
men
who
do
things
then
listen
to
the
wild
it
calling
you
they
have
cradled
you
in
custom
they
have
primed
you
with
their
preaching
they
have
soaked
you
in
convention
through
and
through
they
have
put
you
in
a
showcase
you
a
credit
to
their
teaching
but
ca
you
hear
the
wild
it
calling
you
let
us
probe
the
silent
places
let
us
seek
what
luck
betide
us
let
us
journey
to
a
lonely
land
i
know
there
a
whisper
on
the
there
a
star
agleam
to
guide
us
and
the
wild
is
calling
calling
let
us
go
the
lone
trail
who
know
the
lone
trail
fain
would
follow
it
though
it
lead
to
glory
or
the
darkness
of
the
pit
ye
who
take
the
lone
trail
bid
your
love
the
lone
trail
the
lone
trail
follow
till
you
the
trails
of
the
world
be
countless
and
most
of
the
trails
be
tried
you
tread
on
the
heels
of
the
many
till
you
come
where
the
ways
divide
and
one
lies
safe
in
the
sunlight
and
the
other
is
dreary
and
wan
yet
you
look
aslant
at
the
lone
trail
and
the
lone
trail
lures
you
on
and
somehow
you
sick
of
the
highway
with
its
noise
and
its
easy
needs
and
you
seek
the
risk
of
the
and
you
reck
not
where
it
leads
and
sometimes
it
leads
to
the
desert
and
the
tongue
swells
out
of
the
mouth
and
you
stagger
blind
to
the
mirage
to
die
in
the
mocking
drouth
and
sometimes
it
leads
to
the
mountain
to
the
light
of
the
lone
and
you
gnaw
your
belt
in
the
anguish
of
desire
and
sometimes
it
leads
to
the
southland
to
the
swamp
where
the
orchid
glows
and
you
rave
to
your
grave
with
the
fever
and
they
rob
the
corpse
for
its
clothes
and
sometimes
it
leads
to
the
northland
and
the
scurvy
softens
your
bones
and
your
flesh
dints
in
like
putty
and
you
spit
out
your
teeth
like
stones
and
sometimes
it
leads
to
a
coral
reef
in
the
wash
of
a
weedy
sea
and
you
sit
and
stare
at
the
empty
glare
where
the
gulls
wait
greedily
and
sometimes
it
leads
to
an
arctic
trail
and
the
snows
where
your
torn
feet
freeze
and
you
whittle
away
the
useless
clay
and
crawl
on
your
hands
and
knees
often
it
leads
to
the
always
it
leads
to
pain
by
the
bones
of
your
brothers
ye
know
it
but
oh
to
follow
you
fain
by
your
bones
they
will
follow
behind
you
till
the
ways
of
the
world
are
made
plain
to
sweetheart
bid
to
friend
the
lone
trail
the
lone
trail
follow
to
the
end
tarry
not
and
fear
not
chosen
of
the
true
lover
of
the
lone
trail
the
lone
trail
waits
for
the
pines
we
sleep
in
the
sleep
of
ages
the
bleak
barbarian
pines
the
gray
moss
drapes
us
like
sages
and
closer
we
lock
our
lines
and
deeper
we
clutch
through
the
gelid
gloom
where
never
a
sunbeam
shines
on
the
flanks
of
the
ridges
are
our
black
battalions
massed
we
surge
in
a
host
to
the
sullen
coast
and
we
sing
in
the
ocean
blast
from
empire
of
sea
to
empire
of
snow
we
grip
our
empire
fast
to
the
niggard
lands
were
we
driven
desert
and
floes
are
we
penned
to
us
was
the
northland
given
ours
to
stronghold
and
defend
ours
till
the
world
be
riven
in
the
crash
of
the
utter
end
ours
from
the
bleak
beginning
through
the
aeons
of
sleep
ours
from
the
shock
when
the
naked
rock
was
hurled
from
the
hissing
deep
ours
through
the
twilight
ages
of
weary
glacier
creep
wind
of
the
east
wind
of
the
west
wandering
to
and
fro
chant
your
songs
in
our
topmost
boughs
that
the
sons
of
men
may
know
the
peerless
pine
was
the
first
to
come
and
the
pine
will
be
last
to
go
we
pillar
the
halls
of
perfumed
gloom
we
plume
where
the
eagles
soar
the
swoops
from
the
brooding
pole
and
our
ancients
crash
and
roar
but
where
one
falls
from
the
crumbling
walls
shoots
up
a
hardy
score
we
spring
from
the
gloom
of
the
canyon
womb
in
the
valley
lap
we
lie
from
the
white
where
the
breakers
cringe
to
the
peaks
that
tusk
the
sky
we
climb
and
we
peer
in
the
mere
that
gleams
like
a
golden
eye
gain
to
the
verge
of
the
ridge
where
the
vision
ranges
free
pines
and
pines
and
the
shadow
of
pines
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
a
steadfast
legion
of
stalwart
knights
in
dominant
empery
sun
moon
and
stars
give
answer
shall
we
not
staunchly
stand
even
as
now
forever
wards
of
the
wilder
strand
sentinels
of
the
stillness
lords
of
the
last
lone
land
the
lure
of
little
voices
there
a
cry
from
out
the
loneliness
oh
listen
honey
listen
do
you
hear
it
do
you
fear
it
you
of
me
so
you
in
your
sleep
dear
and
your
lashes
how
they
glisten
do
you
hear
the
little
voices
all
me
to
go
all
me
to
leave
you
day
and
night
they
pleading
praying
on
the
on
the
from
the
peak
and
from
the
plain
night
and
day
they
never
leave
me
do
you
know
what
they
are
saying
he
was
ours
before
you
got
him
and
we
want
him
once
again
yes
they
wanting
me
they
haunting
me
the
awful
lonely
places
they
whining
and
they
whimpering
as
if
each
had
a
soul
they
calling
from
the
wilderness
the
vast
and
spaces
the
stark
and
sullen
solitudes
that
sentinel
the
pole
they
miss
my
little
ever
brightly
bravely
gleaming
in
the
womb
of
desolation
where
was
never
man
before
as
comradeless
i
sought
them
loving
dreaming
and
they
hailed
me
as
a
comrade
and
they
loved
me
evermore
and
now
they
all
and
it
no
use
me
denying
the
spell
of
them
is
on
me
and
i
helpless
as
a
child
my
heart
is
aching
aching
but
i
hear
them
sleeping
waking
it
the
lure
of
little
voices
it
the
mandate
of
the
wild
i
afraid
to
tell
you
honey
i
can
take
no
bitter
leaving
but
softly
in
the
from
your
love
i
steal
away
oh
it
cruel
dearie
cruel
and
it
god
knows
how
i
grieving
but
his
loneliness
is
calling
and
he
knows
i
must
obey
the
song
of
the
when
the
long
long
day
is
over
and
the
big
boss
gives
me
my
pay
i
hope
that
it
wo
be
as
some
of
the
parsons
say
and
i
hope
that
it
wo
be
heaven
with
some
of
the
parsons
i
met
all
i
want
is
just
quiet
just
to
rest
and
forget
look
at
my
face
look
at
my
calloused
hands
master
i
done
thy
bidding
wrought
in
thy
many
lands
wrought
for
the
little
masters
they
be
and
rich
i
done
their
desire
for
a
daily
hire
and
i
die
like
a
dog
in
a
ditch
i
have
used
the
strength
thou
hast
given
thou
knowest
i
did
not
shirk
threescore
years
of
labor
thine
be
the
long
day
work
and
now
big
master
i
broken
and
bent
and
twisted
and
scarred
but
i
held
my
job
and
thou
knowest
and
thou
will
not
judge
me
hard
thou
knowest
my
sins
are
many
and
often
i
played
the
fool
whiskey
and
cards
and
women
they
made
me
the
devil
tool
i
was
just
like
a
child
with
money
i
flung
it
away
with
a
curse
feasting
a
fawning
parasite
or
glutting
a
harlot
purse
then
back
to
the
woods
repentant
back
to
the
mill
or
the
mine
i
the
worker
of
workers
everything
in
my
line
everything
hard
but
headwork
i
no
more
brains
than
a
kid
a
brute
with
brute
strength
to
labor
doing
as
i
was
bid
living
in
camps
with
a
lonely
and
loveless
life
never
knew
kiss
of
sweetheart
never
caress
of
wife
a
brute
with
brute
strength
to
labor
and
they
were
so
far
above
yet
i
gladly
have
gone
to
the
gallows
for
one
little
look
of
love
i
with
the
strength
of
two
men
savage
and
shy
and
wild
yet
how
i
ha
treasured
a
woman
and
the
sweet
warm
kiss
of
a
child
well
is
thy
world
and
thou
knowest
i
blaspheme
and
my
ways
be
rude
but
i
lived
my
life
as
i
found
it
and
i
done
my
best
to
be
good
i
the
primitive
toiler
half
naked
and
grimed
to
the
eyes
sweating
it
deep
in
their
ditches
swining
it
stark
in
their
styes
hurling
down
forests
before
me
spanning
tumultuous
streams
down
in
the
ditch
building
me
palaces
fairer
than
dreams
boring
the
rock
to
the
driving
the
road
through
the
fen
resolute
dumb
uncomplaining
a
man
in
a
world
of
men
master
i
filled
my
contract
wrought
in
thy
many
lands
not
by
my
sins
wilt
thou
judge
me
but
by
the
work
of
my
hands
master
i
done
thy
bidding
and
the
light
is
low
in
the
west
and
the
long
long
shift
is
over
master
i
earned
it
rest
grin
if
you
up
against
a
bruiser
and
you
getting
knocked
about
grin
if
you
feeling
pretty
groggy
and
you
licked
beyond
a
doubt
grin
do
let
him
see
you
funking
let
him
know
with
every
clout
though
your
face
is
battered
to
a
pulp
your
blooming
heart
is
stout
just
stand
upon
your
pins
until
the
beggar
knocks
you
out
and
grin
this
life
a
bally
battle
and
the
same
advice
holds
true
of
grin
if
you
up
against
it
badly
then
it
only
one
on
you
so
grin
if
the
future
black
as
thunder
do
let
people
see
you
blue
just
cultivate
a
smile
of
joy
the
whole
day
through
if
they
call
you
little
sunshine
wish
that
no
troubles
too
you
may
grin
rise
up
in
the
morning
with
the
will
that
smooth
or
rough
you
grin
sink
to
sleep
at
midnight
and
although
you
feeling
tough
yet
grin
there
nothing
gained
by
whining
and
you
not
that
kind
of
stuff
you
a
fighter
from
away
back
and
you
take
a
rebuff
your
trouble
is
that
you
do
know
when
you
have
had
enough
do
give
in
if
fate
should
down
you
just
get
up
and
take
another
cuff
you
may
bank
on
it
that
there
is
no
philosophy
like
bluff
and
grin
the
shooting
of
dan
mcgrew
a
bunch
of
the
boys
were
whooping
it
up
in
the
malamute
saloon
the
kid
that
handles
the
was
hitting
a
tune
back
of
the
bar
in
a
solo
game
sat
dangerous
dan
mcgrew
and
watching
his
luck
was
his
the
lady
that
known
as
lou
when
out
of
the
night
which
was
fifty
below
and
into
the
din
and
the
glare
there
stumbled
a
miner
fresh
from
the
creeks
and
loaded
for
bear
he
looked
like
a
man
with
a
foot
in
the
grave
and
scarcely
the
strength
of
a
louse
yet
he
tilted
a
poke
of
dust
on
the
bar
and
he
called
for
drinks
for
the
house
there
was
none
could
place
the
stranger
face
though
we
searched
ourselves
for
a
clue
but
we
drank
his
health
and
the
last
to
drink
was
dangerous
dan
mcgrew
there
men
that
somehow
just
grip
your
eyes
and
hold
them
hard
like
a
spell
and
such
was
he
and
he
looked
to
me
like
a
man
who
had
lived
in
hell
with
a
face
most
hair
and
the
dreary
stare
of
a
dog
whose
day
is
done
as
he
watered
the
green
stuff
in
his
glass
and
the
drops
fell
one
by
one
then
i
got
to
figgering
who
he
was
and
wondering
what
he
do
and
i
turned
my
head
and
there
watching
him
was
the
lady
that
known
as
lou
his
eyes
went
rubbering
round
the
room
and
he
seemed
in
a
kind
of
daze
till
at
last
that
old
piano
fell
in
the
way
of
his
wandering
gaze
the
kid
was
having
a
drink
there
was
no
one
else
on
the
stool
so
the
stranger
stumbles
across
the
room
and
flops
down
there
like
a
fool
in
a
buckskin
shirt
that
was
glazed
with
dirt
he
sat
and
i
saw
him
sway
then
he
clutched
the
keys
with
his
talon
hands
my
god
but
that
man
could
play
were
you
ever
out
in
the
great
alone
when
the
moon
was
awful
clear
and
the
icy
mountains
hemmed
you
in
with
a
silence
you
most
could
with
only
the
howl
of
a
timber
wolf
and
you
camped
there
in
the
cold
a
thing
in
a
stark
dead
world
clean
mad
for
the
muck
called
gold
while
high
overhead
green
yellow
and
red
the
north
lights
swept
in
bars
then
you
a
haunch
what
the
music
meant
hunger
and
night
and
the
stars
and
hunger
not
of
the
belly
kind
that
banished
with
bacon
and
beans
but
the
gnawing
hunger
of
lonely
men
for
a
home
and
all
that
it
means
for
a
fireside
far
from
the
cares
that
are
four
walls
and
a
roof
above
but
oh
so
cramful
of
cosy
joy
and
crowned
with
a
woman
love
a
woman
dearer
than
all
the
world
and
true
as
heaven
is
true
god
how
ghastly
she
looks
through
her
rouge
the
lady
that
known
as
lou
then
on
a
sudden
the
music
changed
so
soft
that
you
scarce
could
hear
but
you
felt
that
your
life
had
been
looted
clean
of
all
that
it
once
held
dear
that
someone
had
stolen
the
woman
you
loved
that
her
love
was
a
devil
lie
that
your
guts
were
gone
and
the
best
for
you
was
to
crawl
away
and
die
was
the
crowning
cry
of
a
heart
despair
and
it
thrilled
you
through
and
through
i
guess
i
make
it
a
spread
misere
said
dangerous
dan
mcgrew
the
music
almost
died
away
then
it
burst
like
a
flood
and
it
seemed
to
say
repay
repay
and
my
eyes
were
blind
with
blood
the
thought
came
back
of
an
ancient
wrong
and
it
stung
like
a
frozen
lash
and
the
lust
awoke
to
kill
to
kill
then
the
music
stopped
with
a
crash
and
the
stranger
turned
and
his
eyes
they
burned
in
a
most
peculiar
way
in
a
buckskin
shirt
that
was
glazed
with
dirt
he
sat
and
i
saw
him
sway
then
his
lips
went
in
in
a
kind
of
grin
and
he
spoke
and
his
voice
was
calm
and
boys
says
he
you
do
know
me
and
none
of
you
care
a
damn
but
i
want
to
state
and
my
words
are
straight
and
i
bet
my
poke
they
true
that
one
of
you
is
a
hound
of
hell
and
that
one
is
dan
mcgrew
then
i
ducked
my
head
and
the
lights
went
out
and
two
guns
blazed
in
the
dark
and
a
woman
screamed
and
the
lights
went
up
and
two
men
lay
stiff
and
stark
pitched
on
his
head
and
pumped
full
of
lead
was
dangerous
dan
mcgrew
while
the
man
from
the
creeks
lay
clutched
to
the
breast
of
the
lady
that
known
as
lou
these
are
the
simple
facts
of
the
case
and
i
guess
i
ought
to
know
they
say
that
the
stranger
was
crazed
with
hooch
and
i
not
denying
it
so
i
not
so
wise
as
the
lawyer
guys
but
strictly
between
us
two
the
woman
that
kissed
him
and
pinched
his
poke
was
the
lady
that
known
as
lou
the
cremation
of
sam
mcgee
are
strange
things
done
in
the
midnight
sun
by
the
men
who
moil
for
gold
the
arctic
trails
have
their
secret
tales
that
would
make
your
blood
run
cold
the
northern
lights
have
seen
queer
sights
but
the
queerest
they
ever
did
see
was
that
night
on
the
marge
of
lake
lebarge
i
cremated
sam
now
sam
mcgee
was
from
tennessee
where
the
cotton
blooms
and
blows
why
he
left
his
home
in
the
south
to
roam
the
pole
god
only
knows
he
was
always
cold
but
the
land
of
gold
seemed
to
hold
him
like
a
spell
though
he
often
say
in
his
homely
way
that
he
sooner
live
in
hell
on
a
christmas
day
we
were
mushing
our
way
over
the
dawson
trail
talk
of
your
cold
through
the
parka
fold
it
stabbed
like
a
driven
nail
if
our
eyes
we
close
then
the
lashes
froze
till
sometimes
we
could
see
it
was
much
fun
but
the
only
one
to
whimper
was
sam
mcgee
and
that
very
night
as
we
lay
packed
tight
in
our
robes
beneath
the
snow
and
the
dogs
were
fed
and
the
stars
were
dancing
heel
and
toe
he
turned
to
me
and
cap
says
he
i
cash
in
this
trip
i
guess
and
if
i
do
i
asking
that
you
wo
refuse
my
last
request
well
he
seemed
so
low
that
i
could
say
no
then
he
says
with
a
sort
of
moan
it
the
cursed
cold
and
it
got
right
hold
till
i
chilled
clean
through
to
the
bone
yet
being
dead
it
my
awful
dread
of
the
icy
grave
that
pains
so
i
want
you
to
swear
that
foul
or
fair
you
cremate
my
last
remains
a
pal
last
need
is
a
thing
to
heed
so
i
swore
i
would
not
fail
and
we
started
on
at
the
streak
of
dawn
but
god
he
looked
ghastly
pale
he
crouched
on
the
sleigh
and
he
raved
all
day
of
his
home
in
tennessee
and
before
nightfall
a
corpse
was
all
that
was
left
of
sam
mcgee
there
was
a
breath
in
that
land
of
death
and
i
hurried
with
a
corpse
half
hid
that
i
could
get
rid
because
of
a
promise
given
it
was
lashed
to
the
sleigh
and
it
seemed
to
say
you
may
tax
your
brawn
and
brains
but
you
promised
true
and
it
up
to
you
to
cremate
those
last
remains
now
a
promise
made
is
a
debt
unpaid
and
the
trail
has
its
own
stern
code
in
the
days
to
come
though
my
lips
were
dumb
in
my
heart
how
i
cursed
that
load
in
the
long
long
night
by
the
lone
firelight
while
the
huskies
round
in
a
ring
howled
out
their
woes
to
the
homeless
snows
o
god
how
i
loathed
the
thing
and
every
day
that
quiet
clay
seemed
to
heavy
and
heavier
grow
and
on
i
went
though
the
dogs
were
spent
and
the
grub
was
getting
low
the
trail
was
bad
and
i
felt
half
mad
but
i
swore
i
would
not
give
in
and
i
often
sing
to
the
hateful
thing
and
it
hearkened
with
a
grin
till
i
came
to
the
marge
of
lake
lebarge
and
a
derelict
there
lay
it
was
jammed
in
the
ice
but
i
saw
in
a
trice
it
was
called
the
alice
may
and
i
looked
at
it
and
i
thought
a
bit
and
i
looked
at
my
frozen
chum
then
here
said
i
with
a
sudden
cry
is
my
some
planks
i
tore
from
the
cabin
floor
and
i
lit
the
boiler
fire
some
coal
i
found
that
was
lying
around
and
i
heaped
the
fuel
higher
the
flames
just
soared
and
the
furnace
roared
such
a
blaze
you
seldom
see
and
i
burrowed
a
hole
in
the
glowing
coal
and
i
stuffed
in
sam
mcgee
then
i
made
a
hike
for
i
did
like
to
hear
him
sizzle
so
and
the
heavens
scowled
and
the
huskies
howled
and
the
wind
began
to
blow
it
was
icy
cold
but
the
hot
sweat
rolled
down
my
cheeks
and
i
do
know
why
and
the
greasy
smoke
in
an
inky
cloak
went
streaking
down
the
sky
i
do
not
know
how
long
in
the
snow
i
wrestled
with
grisly
fear
but
the
stars
came
out
and
they
danced
about
ere
again
i
ventured
near
i
was
sick
with
dread
but
i
bravely
said
i
just
take
a
peep
inside
i
guess
he
cooked
and
it
time
i
looked
then
the
door
i
opened
wide
and
there
sat
sam
looking
cool
and
calm
in
the
heart
of
the
furnace
roar
and
he
wore
a
smile
you
could
see
a
mile
and
he
said
please
close
that
door
it
fine
in
here
but
i
greatly
fear
you
let
in
the
cold
and
storm
since
i
left
plumtree
down
in
tennessee
it
the
first
time
i
been
warm
are
strange
things
done
in
the
midnight
sun
by
the
men
who
moil
for
gold
the
arctic
trails
have
their
secret
tales
that
would
make
your
blood
run
cold
the
northern
lights
have
seen
queer
sights
but
the
queerest
they
ever
did
see
was
that
night
on
the
marge
of
lake
lebarge
i
cremated
sam
my
madonna
i
haled
me
a
woman
from
the
street
shameless
but
oh
so
fair
i
bade
her
sit
in
the
model
seat
and
i
painted
her
sitting
there
i
hid
all
trace
of
her
heart
unclean
i
painted
a
babe
at
her
breast
i
painted
her
as
she
might
have
been
if
the
worst
had
been
the
best
she
laughed
at
my
picture
and
went
away
then
came
with
a
knowing
nod
a
connoisseur
and
i
heard
him
say
is
mary
the
mother
of
god
so
i
painted
a
halo
round
her
hair
and
i
sold
her
and
took
my
fee
and
she
hangs
in
the
church
of
saint
hillaire
where
you
and
all
may
see
unforgotten
i
know
a
garden
where
the
lilies
gleam
and
one
who
lingers
in
the
sunshine
there
she
is
than
lily
far
more
fair
and
oh
her
eyes
are
with
dream
i
know
a
garret
cold
and
dark
and
drear
and
one
who
toils
and
toils
with
tireless
pen
until
his
brave
sad
eyes
grow
weary
then
he
seeks
the
stars
pale
silent
as
a
seer
and
ah
it
strange
for
desolate
and
dim
between
these
two
there
rolls
an
ocean
wide
yet
he
is
in
the
garden
by
her
side
and
she
is
in
the
garret
there
with
him
the
reckoning
it
fine
to
have
a
in
a
fancy
restaurant
with
terrapin
and
and
all
the
wine
you
want
to
enjoy
the
flowers
and
music
watch
the
pretty
women
pass
smoke
a
choice
cigar
and
sip
the
wealthy
water
in
your
glass
it
bully
in
a
joint
to
eat
and
drink
your
fill
but
it
quite
another
matter
when
you
pay
the
bill
it
great
to
go
out
every
night
on
fun
or
pleasure
bent
to
wear
your
glad
rags
always
and
to
never
save
a
cent
to
drift
along
regardless
have
a
good
time
every
trip
to
hit
the
high
spots
sometimes
and
to
let
your
chances
slip
to
know
you
acting
foolish
yet
to
go
on
fooling
still
till
nature
calls
a
and
you
pay
the
bill
time

got
a
little
bill
get
wise
while
yet
you
may

in
a
most
alarming
way
the
things

no
right
to
do
the
things

should
have
done
they
all
put
down
it
up
to
you
to

for
every
one
so
eat
drink
and
be
merry

a
good

a

my
friend
the
men
that
do
fit

there
a
race
of
men
that
do
fit
in
a
race
that
ca
stay
still
so
they
break
the
hearts
of
kith
and
kin
and
they
roam
the
world
at
will
they
range
the
field
and
they
rove
the
flood
and
they
climb
the
mountain
crest
theirs
is
the
curse
of
the
gypsy
blood
and
they
do
know
how
to
rest
if
they
just
went
straight
they
might
go
far
they
are
strong
and
brave
and
true
but
they
always
tired
of
the
things
that
are
and
they
want
the
strange
and
new
they
say
could
i
find
my
proper
groove
what
a
deep
mark
i
would
make
so
they
chop
and
change
and
each
fresh
move
is
only
a
fresh
mistake
and
each
forgets
as
he
strips
and
runs
with
a
brilliant
fitful
pace
it
the
steady
quiet
plodding
ones
who
win
in
the
lifelong
race
and
each
forgets
that
his
youth
has
fled
forgets
that
his
prime
is
past
till
he
stands
one
day
with
a
hope
that
dead
in
the
glare
of
the
truth
at
last
he
has
failed
he
has
failed
he
has
missed
his
chance
he
has
just
done
things
by
half
life
been
a
jolly
good
joke
on
him
and
now
is
the
time
to
laugh
ha
ha
he
is
one
of
the
legion
lost
he
was
never
meant
to
win
he
a
rolling
stone
and
it
bred
in
the
bone
he
a
man
who
wo
fit
in
music
in
the
bush
the
dark
pines
she
sees
the
silver
moon
and
in
the
west
all
tremulous
a
star
and
soothing
sweet
she
hears
the
mellow
tune
of
jangled
in
the
fields
afar
quite
listless
for
her
daily
stent
is
done
she
stands
sad
exile
at
her
door
and
sends
her
love
eternal
with
the
sun
that
goes
to
gild
the
land
she
see
no
more
the
grave
gaunt
pines
imprison
her
sad
gaze
all
still
the
sky
and
darkling
drearily
she
feels
the
chilly
breath
of
dear
dead
days
come
sifting
through
the
alders
eerily
oh
how
the
roses
riot
in
their
bloom
the
curtains
stir
as
with
an
ancient
pain
her
old
piano
gleams
from
out
the
gloom
and
waits
and
waits
her
tender
touch
in
vain
but
now
her
hands
like
moonlight
brush
the
keys
with
velvet
grace
melodious
delight
and
now
a
sad
refrain
from
over
seas
goes
sobbing
on
the
bosom
of
the
night
and
now
she
sings
o
singer
in
the
gloom
voicing
a
sorrow
we
can
express
here
in
the
farness
where
we
few
have
room
unshamed
to
show
our
love
and
tenderness
our
hearts
will
echo
till
they
beat
no
more
that
song
of
sadness
and
of
motherland
and
stretched
in
deathless
love
to
england
shore
some
day
she
hearken
and
she
understand
a
in
the
shining
past
but
now
a
mother
growing
old
and
gray
she
thinks
of
how
she
held
a
people
fast
in
thrall
and
gleaned
the
triumphs
of
a
day
she
sees
a
sea
of
faces
like
a
dream
she
sees
herself
a
queen
of
song
once
more
she
sees
lips
part
in
rapture
eyes
agleam
she
sings
as
never
once
she
sang
before
she
sings
a
wild
sweet
song
that
throbs
with
pain
the
added
pain
of
life
that
transcends
art
a
song
of
home
a
deep
celestial
strain
the
glorious
of
a
dying
heart
a
lame
tramp
comes
along
the
railway
track
a
grizzled
dog
whose
day
is
nearly
done
he
passes
pauses
then
comes
slowly
back
and
listens
there
an
audience
of
one
she
sings
her
golden
voice
is
as
when
she
charmed
a
thousand
eager
ears
he
listens
trembling
and
she
knows
it
not
and
down
his
hollow
cheeks
roll
bitter
tears
she
ceases
and
is
still
as
if
to
pray
there
is
no
sound
the
stars
are
all
alight
only
a
wretch
who
stumbles
on
his
way
only
a
vagrant
sobbing
in
the
night
the
rhyme
of
the
remittance
man
there
a
buck
in
the
shadow
of
my
cabin
and
it
roamed
the
velvet
valley
till
but
i
tracked
it
by
the
river
and
i
trailed
it
in
the
cover
and
i
killed
it
on
the
mountain
miles
away
now
i
had
my
lazy
supper
and
the
level
sun
is
gleaming
on
the
water
where
the
silver
salmon
play
and
i
light
my
little
and
i
linger
softly
dreaming
in
the
twilight
of
a
land
that
far
away
far
away
so
faint
and
far
is
flaming
london
fevered
paris
that
i
fancy
i
have
gained
another
star
far
away
the
din
and
hurry
far
away
the
sin
and
worry
far
away
god
knows
they
can
not
be
too
far
gilded
of
mammon
how
my
brothers
taunt
me
i
might
have
been
as
as
they
had
i
clutched
like
them
my
chances
learned
their
wisdom
crushed
my
fancies
starved
my
soul
and
gone
to
business
every
day
well
the
cherry
bends
with
blossom
and
the
vivid
grass
is
springing
and
the
lily
nestles
in
the
green
and
the
frogs
their
joys
are
singing
and
my
heart
in
tune
is
ringing
and
it
does
matter
what
i
might
have
been
while
above
the
scented
piling
heights
of
golden
glory
the
paints
his
canvas
in
the
west
i
can
couch
me
deep
in
clover
i
can
listen
to
the
story
of
the
lazy
lapping
water
it
is
best
while
the
trout
leaps
in
the
river
and
the
blue
grouse
thrills
the
cover
and
the
frozen
snow
betrays
the
panther
track
and
the
robin
greets
the
dayspring
with
the
rapture
of
a
lover
i
am
happy
and
i
nevermore
go
back
for
i
know
i
just
be
longing
for
the
little
old
log
cabin
with
the
clinging
to
the
door
till
i
loathed
the
city
places
cursed
the
care
on
all
the
faces
turned
my
back
on
lazar
london
evermore
so
send
me
far
from
lombard
street
and
write
me
down
a
failure
put
a
little
in
my
purse
and
leave
me
free
say
he
turned
from
fortune
offering
to
follow
up
a
pale
lure
he
is
one
of
us
no
longer
let
him
be
i
am
one
of
you
no
longer
by
the
trails
my
feet
have
broken
the
dizzy
peaks
i
scaled
the
glow
by
the
lonely
seas
i
sailed
in
yea
the
final
word
is
spoken
i
am
signed
and
sealed
to
nature
be
it
so
the
white
this
is
the
up
at
the
mines
when
the
bearded
brutes
come
down
there
money
to
burn
in
the
streets
so
i
sent
my
klooch
to
town
with
a
haggard
face
and
a
ribband
of
red
entwined
in
her
hair
of
brown
and
i
know
at
the
dawn
she
come
reeling
home
with
the
bottles
one
two
three
one
for
herself
to
drown
her
shame
and
two
big
bottles
for
me
to
make
me
forget
the
thing
i
am
and
the
man
i
used
to
be
to
make
me
forget
the
brand
of
the
dog
as
i
crouch
in
this
hideous
place
to
make
me
forget
once
i
kindled
the
light
of
love
in
a
lady
face
where
even
the
squalid
siwash
now
holds
me
a
black
disgrace
oh
i
have
guarded
my
secret
well
and
who
would
dream
as
i
speak
in
a
tribal
tongue
like
a
rogue
unhung
the
filth
and
reek
i
could
roll
to
bed
with
a
latin
phrase
and
rise
with
a
verse
of
greek
yet
i
was
a
senior
prizeman
once
and
the
pride
of
a
college
eight
called
to
the
bar
my
friends
were
true
but
they
could
not
keep
me
straight
then
came
the
divorce
and
i
went
abroad
and
died
on
the
river
plate
but
i
not
dead
yet
though
with
half
a
lung
there
is
time
to
spare
and
i
hope
that
the
year
will
see
me
out
and
thank
god
no
one
will
care
save
maybe
the
little
slim
siwash
girl
with
the
rose
of
shame
in
her
hair
she
will
come
with
the
dawn
and
the
dawn
is
near
i
can
see
its
evil
glow
like
a
seen
through
a
frosty
pane
in
a
night
of
want
and
woe
and
yonder
she
comes
by
the
bleak
swift
staggering
through
the
snow
the
little
old
log
cabin
when
a
man
gits
on
his
uppers
in
a
sort
of
town
an
he
ai
got
nothin
comin
an
he
ca
afford
ter
eat
an
he
in
a
fix
for
lodgin
an
he
wanders
up
an
down
an
you
fancy
he
been
boozin
he
so
locoed
the
feet
when
he
feelin
sneakin
sorry
an
his
belt
is
hangin
slack
an
his
face
is
peaked
an
an
his
heart
gits
down
an
whines
then
he
apt
ter
git
an
he
was
back
in
the
little
ol
log
cabin
in
the
shadder
of
the
pines
when
he
on
the
blazin
desert
an
his
canteen
sprung
a
leak
an
he
all
alone
an
crazy
an
he
crawlin
like
a
snail
an
his
tongue
so
black
an
swollen
that
it
hurts
him
fer
to
speak
an
he
gouges
down
fer
water
an
the
raven
on
his
trail
when
he
done
with
care
and
cursin
an
he
feels
more
like
to
cry
an
he
sees
ol
death
an
he
thinks
upon
his
crimes
then
he
like
ter
hev
a
vision
as
he
settles
down
ter
die
of
the
little
ol
log
cabin
an
the
roses
an
the
vines
oh
the
little
ol
log
cabin
it
a
solemn
shinin
mark
when
a
feller
gits
ter
sinnin
an
ter
the
wall
an
folks
do
understand
him
an
he
gropin
in
the
dark
an
he
sick
of
bein
cursed
at
an
he
longin
fer
his
call
when
the
sun
of
life
you
can
see
it
above
on
the
hill
from
out
the
shadder
in
a
glory
the
sky
an
your
mother
voice
is
callin
an
her
arms
are
stretched
in
love
an
somehow
you
glad
you
goin
an
you
ai
to
die
when
you
be
like
a
kid
again
an
nestle
to
her
breast
an
never
leave
its
shelter
an
forget
an
love
an
rest
the
younger
son
if
you
leave
the
gloom
of
london
and
you
seek
a
glowing
land
where
all
except
the
flag
is
strange
and
new
there
a
bronzed
and
stalwart
fellow
who
will
grip
you
by
the
hand
and
greet
you
with
a
welcome
warm
and
true
for
he
your
younger
brother
the
one
you
sent
away
because
there
was
room
for
him
at
home
and
now
he
quite
contented
and
he
glad
he
did
stay
and
he
building
britain
greatness
the
foam
when
the
giant
herd
is
moving
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
the
prairie
is
lit
with
rose
and
gold
and
the
camp
is
all
abustle
and
the
busy
day
begun
he
leaps
into
the
saddle
sure
and
bold
through
the
round
of
heat
and
hurry
through
the
racket
and
the
rout
he
rattles
at
a
pace
that
nothing
mars
and
when
the
whisper
and
flicker
out
he
is
sleeping
like
a
child
beneath
the
stars
when
the
are
drooping
in
the
sombre
glade
and
the
breathless
land
is
lying
in
a
swoon
he
leaves
his
work
a
moment
leaning
lightly
on
his
spade
and
he
hears
the
chime
the
austral
noon
the
parrakeets
are
silent
in
the
by
the
creek
the
ferny
grove
is
and
still
but
the
dew
will
gem
the
myrtle
in
the
twilight
ere
he
seek
his
little
lonely
cabin
on
the
hill
around
the
purple
slope
the
argent
river
dreams
the
roses
almost
hide
the
house
from
view
a
of
the
winterberg
in
crimson
splendor
gleams
the
shadow
deepens
down
on
the
karroo
he
seeks
the
dusk
beneath
the
orange
tree
his
pipe
in
silence
glows
and
fades
and
glows
and
then
two
little
maids
come
out
and
climb
upon
his
knee
and
one
is
like
the
lily
one
the
rose
he
sees
his
white
sheep
dapple
the
green
new
zealand
plain
and
where
vancouver
shaggy
ramparts
frown
when
the
sunlight
threads
the
he
is
fighting
might
and
main
to
clinch
the
rivets
of
an
empire
down
you
will
find
him
toiling
toiling
in
the
south
or
in
the
west
a
child
of
nature
fearless
frank
and
free
and
the
warmest
heart
that
beats
for
you
is
beating
in
his
breast
and
he
sends
you
loyal
greeting
the
sea
you
a
brother
in
the
army
you
another
in
the
church
one
of
you
is
a
diplomatic
swell
you
had
the
pick
of
everything
and
left
him
in
the
lurch
and
yet
i
think
he
doing
very
well
i
sure
his
life
is
happy
and
he
does
envy
yours
i
know
he
loves
the
land
his
pluck
has
won
and
i
fancy
in
the
years
unborn
while
england
fame
endures
she
will
come
to
bless
with
pride
the
younger
son
the
march
of
the
dead
the
cruel
war
was
over
oh
the
triumph
was
so
sweet
we
watched
the
troops
returning
through
our
tears
there
was
triumph
triumph
triumph
down
the
scarlet
glittering
street
and
you
scarce
could
hear
the
music
for
the
cheers
and
you
scarce
could
see
the
for
the
flags
that
flew
between
the
bells
were
pealing
madly
to
the
sky
and
everyone
was
shouting
for
the
soldiers
of
the
queen
and
the
glory
of
an
age
was
passing
by
and
then
there
came
a
shadow
swift
and
sudden
dark
and
drear
the
bells
were
silent
not
an
echo
stirred
the
flags
were
drooping
sullenly
the
men
forgot
to
cheer
we
waited
and
we
never
spoke
a
word
the
sky
grew
darker
darker
till
from
out
the
gloomy
rack
there
came
a
voice
that
checked
the
heart
with
dread
tear
down
tear
down
your
bunting
now
and
hang
up
sable
black
they
are
coming
it
the
army
of
the
dead
they
were
coming
they
were
coming
gaunt
and
ghastly
sad
and
slow
they
were
coming
all
the
crimson
wrecks
of
pride
with
faces
seared
and
cheeks
red
smeared
and
haunting
eyes
of
woe
and
clotted
holes
the
khaki
could
hide
oh
the
clammy
brow
of
anguish
the
livid
lips
the
reeling
ranks
of
ruin
swept
along
the
limb
that
trailed
the
hand
that
failed
the
bloody
finger
tips
and
oh
the
dreary
rhythm
of
their
song
they
left
us
on
the
but
we
felt
we
could
stop
on
this
our
england
crowning
festal
day
we
the
men
of
magersfontein
we
the
men
of
spion
kop
colenso
we
the
men
who
had
to
pay
we
the
men
who
paid
the
shall
the
grave
be
all
our
gain
you
owe
us
long
and
heavy
is
the
score
then
cheer
us
for
our
glory
now
and
cheer
us
for
our
pain
and
cheer
us
as
ye
never
cheered
before
the
folks
were
white
and
stricken
and
each
tongue
seemed
weighted
with
lead
each
heart
was
clutched
in
hollow
hand
of
ice
and
every
eye
was
staring
at
the
horror
of
the
dead
the
pity
of
the
men
who
paid
the
price
they
were
come
were
come
to
mock
us
in
the
first
flush
of
our
peace
through
writhing
lips
their
teeth
were
all
agleam
they
were
coming
in
their
thousands
oh
would
they
never
cease
i
closed
my
eyes
and
then
it
was
a
dream
there
was
triumph
triumph
triumph
down
the
scarlet
gleaming
street
the
town
was
mad
a
man
was
like
a
boy
a
thousand
flags
were
flaming
where
the
sky
and
city
meet
a
thousand
bells
were
thundering
the
joy
there
was
music
mirth
and
sunshine
but
some
eyes
shone
with
regret
and
while
we
stun
with
cheers
our
homing
braves
o
god
in
thy
great
mercy
let
us
nevermore
forget
the
graves
they
left
behind
the
bitter
graves
fighting
mac
a
life
tragedy
a
pistol
shot
rings
round
and
round
the
world
in
pitiful
defeat
a
warrior
lies
a
last
defiance
to
dark
death
is
hurled
a
last
wild
challenge
shocks
the
sunlit
skies
alone
he
falls
with
wide
wan
woeful
eyes
eyes
that
could
smile
at
death
could
not
face
shame
alone
alone
he
paced
his
narrow
room
in
the
bright
sunshine
of
that
paris
day
saw
in
his
thought
the
awful
hand
of
doom
saw
in
his
dream
his
glory
pass
away
tried
in
his
heart
his
weary
heart
to
pray
o
god
who
made
me
give
me
strength
to
face
the
spectre
of
this
bitter
black
disgrace
the
burn
brawls
darkly
down
the
shaggy
glen
the
heather
blooms
around
the
door
he
sees
himself
a
barefoot
boy
again
bending
page
of
legendary
lore
he
hears
the
pibroch
grips
the
red
claymore
runs
with
the
fiery
cross
a
clansman
true
sworn
kinsman
of
rob
roy
and
roderick
dhu
eating
his
heart
out
with
a
wild
desire
one
day
behind
his
counter
trim
and
neat
he
hears
a
sound
that
sets
his
brain
afire
the
highlanders
are
marching
down
the
street
oh
how
the
pipes
shrill
out
the
mad
drums
beat
on
to
the
gates
of
hell
my
gordons
gay
he
flings
his
hated
yardstick
away
he
sees
the
sullen
pass
with
snow
where
afghans
cower
with
eyes
of
gleaming
hate
he
hurls
himself
against
the
hidden
foe
they
try
to
rally
ah
too
late
too
late
again
defenseless
with
fierce
eyes
that
wait
for
death
he
stands
like
baited
bull
at
bay
and
flouts
the
boers
that
mad
majuba
day
he
sees
again
the
murderous
soudan
and
he
seems
to
stand
upon
the
gory
plain
of
omdurman
then
magersfontein
and
supreme
command
over
his
highlanders
to
shake
his
hand
a
king
is
proud
and
princes
call
him
friend
and
glory
crowns
his
life
and
now
the
end
the
awful
end
his
eyes
are
dark
with
doom
he
hears
the
shrapnel
shrieking
overhead
he
sees
the
ravaged
ranks
the
gloom
oh
to
have
fallen
the
his
bed
with
wauchope
and
his
glorious
why
was
he
saved
for
this
for
this
and
now
he
raises
the
revolver
to
his
brow
in
many
a
highland
home
framed
with
rude
art
you
find
his
portrait
stern
and
square
it
graven
in
the
fuyam
fellah
heart
the
ghurka
reads
it
at
his
evening
prayer
the
raw
lands
know
it
where
the
fierce
suns
glare
the
dervish
fears
it
honor
to
his
name
who
holds
aloft
the
shield
of
england
fame
mourn
for
our
hero
men
of
northern
race
we
do
not
know
his
sin
we
only
know
his
sword
was
keen
he
laughed
death
in
the
face
and
struck
for
empire
sake
a
giant
blow
his
arm
was
strong
ah
well
they
learnt
the
foe
the
echo
of
his
deeds
is
ringing
yet
will
ring
for
aye
all
else
let
us
forget
the
woman
and
the
angel
an
angel
was
tired
of
heaven
as
he
lounged
in
the
golden
street
his
halo
was
tilted
sideways
and
his
harp
lay
mute
at
his
feet
so
the
master
stooped
in
his
pity
and
gave
him
a
pass
to
go
for
the
space
of
a
moon
to
the
to
mix
with
the
men
below
he
doffed
his
celestial
garments
scarce
waiting
to
lay
them
straight
he
bade
good
by
to
peter
who
stood
by
the
golden
gate
the
sexless
singers
of
heaven
chanted
a
fond
farewell
and
the
imps
looked
up
as
they
pattered
on
the
flags
of
hell
never
was
seen
such
an
angel
eyes
of
heavenly
blue
features
that
shamed
apollo
hair
of
a
golden
hue
the
women
simply
adored
him
his
lips
were
like
cupid
bow
but
he
never
ventured
to
use
them
and
so
they
voted
him
slow
till
at
last
there
came
one
woman
a
marvel
of
loveliness
and
she
whispered
to
him
do
you
love
me
and
he
answered
that
woman
yes
and
she
said
put
your
arms
around
me
and
kiss
me
and
hold
me
so
but
fiercely
he
drew
back
saying
this
thing
is
wrong
and
i
know
then
sweetly
she
mocked
his
scruples
and
softly
she
him
beguiled
you
who
are
verily
man
among
men
speak
with
the
tongue
of
a
child
we
have
outlived
the
old
standards
we
have
burst
like
an
thong
the
ancient
outworn
puritanic
traditions
of
right
and
wrong
then
the
master
feared
for
his
angel
and
called
him
again
to
his
side
for
oh
the
woman
was
wondrous
and
oh
the
angel
was
tried
and
deep
in
his
hell
sang
the
devil
and
this
was
the
strain
of
his
song
the
ancient
outworn
puritanic
traditions
of
right
and
wrong
the
rhyme
of
the
restless
ones
we
could
sit
and
study
for
the
law
the
stagnation
of
a
bank
we
could
stand
for
our
riot
blood
was
surging
and
we
did
need
much
urging
to
excitements
and
excesses
that
are
banned
so
we
took
to
wine
and
drink
and
other
things
and
the
devil
in
us
struggled
to
be
free
till
our
friends
rose
up
in
wrath
and
they
pointed
out
the
path
and
they
paid
our
debts
and
packed
us
the
sea
oh
they
shook
us
off
and
shipped
us
the
foam
to
the
larger
lands
that
lure
a
man
to
roam
and
we
took
the
chance
they
gave
of
a
far
and
foreign
grave
and
we
bade
for
evermore
to
home
and
some
of
us
are
climbing
on
the
peak
and
some
of
us
are
camping
on
the
plain
by
pine
and
palm
you
find
us
with
never
claim
to
bind
us
by
track
and
trail
you
meet
us
once
again
we
are
the
fated
serfs
to
freedom
sky
and
sea
we
have
failed
where
slummy
cities
overflow
but
the
stranger
ways
of
earth
know
our
pride
and
know
our
worth
and
we
go
into
the
dark
as
fighters
go
yes
we
go
into
the
night
as
brave
men
go
though
our
faces
they
be
often
streaked
with
woe
yet
we
hard
as
cats
to
kill
and
our
hearts
are
reckless
still
and
we
danced
with
death
a
dozen
times
or
so
and
you
find
us
in
alaska
after
gold
and
you
find
us
herding
cattle
in
the
south
we
like
strong
drink
and
fun
and
when
the
race
is
run
we
often
die
with
curses
in
our
mouth
we
are
wild
as
colts
unbroke
but
never
mean
of
our
sins
we
shoulders
broad
to
bear
the
blame
but
we
never
stay
in
town
and
we
never
settle
down
and
we
never
have
an
object
or
an
aim
no
there
that
in
us
that
time
can
never
tame
and
life
will
always
seem
a
careless
game
and
they
better
far
forget
those
who
say
they
love
us
yet
forget
blot
out
with
bitterness
our
name
new
year
eve
it
cruel
cold
on
the
silent
and
dark
and
drear
only
the
black
tide
weltering
only
the
hissing
snow
and
i
alone
like
a
wreck
on
this
night
of
the
glad
new
year
shuffling
along
in
the
icy
wind
ghastly
and
gaunt
and
slow
they
playing
a
tune
in
mcguffy
saloon
and
it
cheery
and
bright
in
there
god
but
i
weak
since
the
bitter
dawn
and
never
a
bite
of
food
i
just
go
over
and
slip
inside
i
must
give
way
to
despair
perhaps
i
can
bum
a
little
booze
if
the
boys
are
feeling
good
they
jeer
at
me
and
they
sneer
at
me
and
they
call
me
a
whiskey
soak
have
a
drink
well
thankee
kindly
sir
i
do
mind
if
i
do
a
drivelling
dirty
fiend
the
butt
of
the
joke
sunk
and
sodden
and
hopeless
another
well
here
to
you
mcguffy
is
showing
a
bunch
of
the
boys
how
bob
fitzsimmons
hit
the
barman
is
talking
of
tammany
hall
and
why
the
ward
boss
got
fired
i
just
sneak
into
a
corner
and
they
let
me
alone
a
bit
the
room
is
reeling
round
and
round
o
god
but
i
tired
i
tired
roses
she
wore
on
her
breast
that
night
oh
but
their
scent
was
sweet
alone
we
sat
on
the
balcony
and
the
arched
above
the
witching
strain
of
a
waltz
by
strauss
came
up
to
our
cool
retreat
and
i
prisoned
her
little
hand
in
mine
and
i
whispered
my
plea
of
love
then
sudden
the
laughter
died
on
her
lips
and
lowly
she
bent
her
head
and
oh
there
came
in
the
deep
dark
eyes
a
look
that
was
heaven
to
see
and
the
moments
went
and
i
waited
there
and
never
a
word
was
said
and
she
plucked
from
her
bosom
a
rose
of
red
and
shyly
gave
it
to
me
then
the
music
swelled
to
a
crash
of
joy
and
the
lights
blazed
up
like
day
and
i
held
her
fast
to
my
throbbing
heart
and
i
kissed
her
bonny
brow
she
is
mine
she
is
mine
for
evermore
the
violins
seemed
to
say
and
the
bells
were
ringing
the
new
year
in
o
god
i
can
hear
them
now
do
you
remember
that
long
last
waltz
with
its
sobbing
sad
refrain
do
you
remember
that
last
and
the
dear
eyes
dim
with
tears
do
you
remember
that
golden
dream
with
never
a
hint
of
pain
of
lives
that
would
blend
like
an
in
the
bliss
of
the
coming
years
oh
what
have
i
lost
what
have
i
lost
ethel
forgive
forgive
the
red
red
rose
is
faded
now
and
it
fifty
years
ago
better
to
die
a
thousand
deaths
than
live
each
day
as
i
live
i
have
sinned
i
have
sunk
to
the
lowest
depths
but
oh
i
have
suffered
so
hark
oh
hark
i
can
hear
the
bells
look
i
can
see
her
there
fair
as
a
dream
but
it
fades
and
now
i
can
hear
the
dreadful
hum
of
the
crowded
court
see
the
judge
looks
down
my
lord
i
swear
the
bells
i
can
hear
the
bells
again

muddled
head

glad
new
year

drop
before

old
dirty
hobo

god

heap
of
trouble

cent
for
life

of
hope

failing
wish
you
die
why
you
still
the
sunshine
left
you
and
the
big
blue
sky
sky
so
blue
it
makes
you
wonder
if
it
heaven
shining
through
earth
so
smiling
out
yonder
sun
so
bright
it
dazzles
you
birds
flowers
all
their
fragrance
on
the
breeze
dancing
shadows
green
still
meadows
do
you
mope
you
still
got
these
these
and
none
can
take
them
from
you
these
and
none
can
weigh
their
worth
what
you
tired
and
broke
and
beaten
why
you
rich
you
got
the
earth
yes
if
you
a
tramp
in
tatters
while
the
blue
sky
bends
above
you
got
nearly
all
that
matters
you
got
god
and
god
is
love
the
harpy
there
was
a
woman
and
she
was
wise
woefully
wise
was
she
she
was
old
so
old
yet
her
years
all
told
were
but
a
score
and
three
and
she
knew
by
heart
from
finish
to
start
the
book
of
iniquity
there
is
no
hope
for
such
as
i
on
earth
nor
yet
in
heaven
unloved
i
live
unloved
i
die
unpitied
unforgiven
a
loathed
jade
i
ply
my
trade
unhallowed
and
unshriven
i
paint
my
cheeks
for
they
are
white
and
cheeks
of
chalk
men
hate
mine
eyes
with
wine
i
make
them
shine
that
man
may
seek
and
sate
with
overhead
a
lamp
of
red
i
sit
me
down
and
wait
until
they
come
the
nightly
scum
with
drunken
eyes
aflame
your
sweethearts
sons
ye
scornful
ones
is
i
who
know
their
shame
the
gods
ye
see
are
brutes
to
me
and
so
i
play
my
game
for
life
is
not
the
thing
we
thought
and
not
the
thing
we
plan
and
woman
in
a
bitter
world
must
do
the
best
she
can
must
yield
the
stroke
and
bear
the
yoke
and
serve
the
will
of
man
must
serve
his
need
and
ever
feed
the
flame
of
his
desire
though
be
she
loved
for
love
alone
or
be
she
loved
for
hire
for
every
man
since
life
began
is
tainted
with
the
mire
and
though
you
know
he
love
you
so
and
set
you
on
love
throne
yet
let
your
eyes
but
mock
his
sighs
and
let
your
heart
be
stone
lest
you
be
left
as
i
was
left
attainted
and
alone
from
love
close
kiss
to
hell
abyss
is
one
sheer
flight
i
trow
and
wedding
ring
and
bridal
bell
are
of
woe
and
is
not
wise
to
love
too
well
and
this
all
women
know
wherefore
the
having
gorged
upon
the
lamb
their
prey
with
siren
smile
and
serpent
guile
i
make
the
pay
with
velvet
paws
and
flensing
claws
a
tigress
roused
to
slay
one
who
in
youth
sought
truest
truth
and
found
a
devil
lies
a
symbol
of
the
sin
of
man
a
human
sacrifice
yet
shall
i
blame
on
man
the
shame
could
it
be
otherwise
was
i
not
born
to
walk
in
scorn
where
others
walk
in
pride
the
maker
marred
and
i
drift
upon
his
tide
and
he
alone
shall
judge
his
own
so
i
his
judgment
bide
fate
has
written
a
tragedy
its
name
is
the
human
heart
the
theatre
is
the
house
of
life
woman
the
mummer
part
the
devil
enters
the
prompter
box
and
the
play
is
ready
to
start
premonition
was
a
year
ago
and
the
moon
was
bright
oh
i
remember
so
well
so
well
i
walked
with
my
love
in
a
sea
of
light
and
the
voice
of
my
sweet
was
a
silver
bell
and
sudden
the
moon
grew
strangely
dull
and
sudden
my
love
had
taken
wing
i
looked
on
the
face
of
a
grinning
skull
i
strained
to
my
heart
a
ghastly
thing
was
but
fantasy
for
my
love
lay
still
in
my
arms
with
her
tender
eyes
aglow
and
she
wondered
why
my
lips
were
chill
why
i
was
silent
and
kissed
her
so
a
year
has
gone
and
the
moon
is
bright
a
gibbous
moon
like
a
ghost
of
woe
i
sit
by
a
grave
and
my
heart
is
broken
it
strange
you
know
the
tramps
can
you
recall
dear
comrade
when
we
tramped
god
land
together
and
we
sang
the
old
old
for
our
youth
was
very
sweet
when
we
drank
and
fought
and
lusted
as
we
mocked
at
tie
and
tether
along
the
road
to
anywhere
the
wide
world
at
our
feet
along
the
road
to
anywhere
when
each
day
had
its
story
when
time
was
yet
our
vassal
and
life
jest
was
still
unstale
when
peace
unfathomed
filled
our
hearts
as
bathed
in
amber
glory
along
the
road
to
anywhere
we
watched
the
sunsets
pale
alas
the
road
to
anywhere
is
pitfalled
with
disaster
there
hunger
want
and
weariness
yet
o
we
loved
it
so
as
on
we
tramped
exultantly
and
no
man
was
our
master
and
no
man
guessed
what
dreams
were
ours
as
swinging
heel
and
toe
we
tramped
the
road
to
anywhere
the
magic
road
to
anywhere
the
tragic
road
to
anywhere
such
dear
dim
years
ago
you
who
have
lived
in
the
land
you
who
have
trusted
the
trail
you
who
are
strong
to
withstand
you
who
are
swift
to
assail
have
i
sung
to
beguile
vintage
of
desperate
years
hard
as
a
harlot
smile
bitter
as
unshed
little
of
joy
or
mirth
little
of
ease
i
sing
sagas
of
men
of
earth
humanly
suffering
as
you
all
have
done
savagely
faring
forth
sons
of
the
midnight
sun
argonauts
of
the
far
in
the
land
god
forgot
glimmers
the
lure
of
your
trail
still
in
your
lust
are
you
taught
even
to
win
is
to
fail
you
must
follow
and
fight
under
the
vampire
wing
there
in
the
long
long
night
hoping
and
husbandman
of
the
wild
reaping
a
barren
gain
scourged
by
desire
reconciled
unto
disaster
and
pain
my
songs
are
for
you
you
who
are
seared
with
the
brand
god
knows
i
have
tried
to
be
true
please
god
you
will
