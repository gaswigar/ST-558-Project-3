so
wrote
george
cooke
in
order
no
i
from

quarters
mormon
battalion
mission
of

under
date
of
january
if
cooke
is
accurate
in
his
statement
and
one
has
a
right
to
assume
that
he
is
since
he
was
a
graduate
of
the
united
states
military
academy
of
west
point
and
hence
versed
in
the
history
of
such
military
incidents
then
the
march
of
this
battalion
is
a
very
wonderful
performance
for
if
history
might
be
searched
in
vain
for
an
equal
march
of
infantry
when
cooke
wrote
his
order
no
i
then
certainly
no
march
of
infantry
since
that
time
has
equaled
it
the
only
other
historical
marches
that
are
comparable
with
the
mormon
battalions
march
are
xenophon
and
doniphan
the
former
in
ancient
the
latter
in
modern
times
of
the
ten
xenophon
march
is
commonly
known
as
the
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
the
account
of
the
retreat
is
given
in
xenophon
anabasis
about
fourteen
thousand
greek
soldiers
under
a
spartan
leader
named
clearchus
entered
the
service
of
a
persian
prince
cyrus
surnamed
the
younger
brother
of
the
then
reigning
king
of
persia
artaxerxes
ii
the
purpose
of
cyrus
was
to
deprive
his
brother
of
the
throne
of
persia
and
reign
in
his
stead
the
expedition
marched
through
asia
minor
to
cunaxa
near
old
babylon
where
an
army
of
persians
engaged
the
army
of
cyrus
which
with
his
greek
auxiliaries
number
but
the
smaller
army
was
really
successful
in
the
battle
but
a
rash
attempt
on
the
part
of
cyrus
to
slay
his
brother
during
the
engagement
in
which
he
himself
was
killed
changed
the
fortunes
of
the
day
the
expedition
ended
in
failure
and
hence
the
retreat
of
the
greek
ten
thousand
up
the
valley
of
the
tigris
through
armenia
to
trebizond
a
greek
city
on
the
euxine
our
modern
black
sea
this
march
of
greek
infantry
though
attended
with
almost
incredible
hardships
from
cold
hunger
and
the
assaults
of
enemies
was
not
equal
to
the
march
of
the
mormon
battalion
for
the
reason
that
it
covered
but
fifteen
hundred
miles
as
against
the
two
thousand
miles
covered
by
the
battalion
while
the
greek
infantry
in
their
retreat
numbered
more
men
than
the
battalion
and
fought
many
battles
their
march
was
for
the
most
part
through
settled
lands
and
along
well
defined
roads
while
the
greater
part
of
the
battalion
march
was
through
desert
lands
and
four
hundred
and
miles
of
it
through
trackless
deserts
where
nothing
but
savages
and
wild
beasts
were
found
or
deserts
where
for
want
of
water
there
was
no
living
creature
a
expedition
into
doniphan
march
occurred
in
the
same
year
and
in
the
same
war
in
which
the
battalion
served
the
war
with
mexico
the
march
is
known
as
doniphan
expedition
into
mexico
the
expedition
started
from
santa
fe
and
marched
to
matamoras
near
where
the
rio
grande
empties
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
a
distance
of
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
hundred
miles
b
the
march
was
via
el
paso
chihuahua
parras
saltillo
and
monterey
thence
to
matamoras
here
the
expedition
embarked
for
new
orleans
where
the
men
were
mustered
out
of
service
the
important
battles
of
brazito
and
sacramento
were
fought
enroute
the
former
placing
el
paso
and
the
latter
the
city
of
chihuahua
capital
of
the
state
of
the
same
name
in
the
hands
of
the
americans
the
expedition
numbered
about
nine
hundred
men
mostly
from
missouri
and
under
the
command
of
alexander
doniphan
of
that
state
and
returned
to
missouri
via
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
mississippi
the
march
overland
it
will
be
observed
was
less
than
that
of
the
battalion
for
the
most
part
moreover
doniphan
march
was
through
a
settled
country
and
over
roads
long
used
between
santa
fe
and
points
in
northern
and
central
mexico
besides
the
expedition
was
not
exclusively
made
up
of
infantry
being
mixed
cavalry
and
infantry
and
therefore
would
not
strictly
come
in
competition
with
the
battalion
which
was
entirely
of
infantry
with
accompanying
baggage
wagons
expedition
is
so
wonderful
a
performance
however
and
has
been
so
generously
acclaimed
that
if
unmentioned
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
the
battalion
and
the
contrast
made
as
above
it
might
be
thought
by
some
to
rival
the
march
of
the
latter
this
however
is
not
the
case
world
record
for
a
march
of
not
even
in
the
great
war
now
happily
ended
has
the
mormon
battalion
march
been
equaled
though
in
all
other
things
that
war
has
surpassed
the
previous
war
experiences
of
mankind
and
since
the
battalion
march
has
not
been
equaled
by
any
march
of
infantry
in
the
world
great
war
nor
in
ancient
times
it
is
not
likely
now
owing
to
the
new
methods
for
the
transportation
of
troops
that
have
been
developed
that
the
mormon
battalion
march
across
more
than
half
of
the
north
american
continent
will
ever
be
equaled
it
will
stand
as
the
world
record
for
a
march
of
infantry

b
i
am
aware
that
the
historian
of
doniphan
expedition
william
connelley
credits
the
expedition
with
a
grand
circuit
of
miles
miles
of
which
he
states
was
by
water
leaving
a
distance
of
miles
by
land
but
he
accounts
the
expedition
as
starting
from
independence
and
returning
to
it
whereas
the
expedition
was
organized
and
began
its
great
march
at
santa
fe
and
ended
at
matamoras
where
it
embarked
for
home
ii
the
call
of
the
battalion
the
mormon
battalion
owes
its
existence
to
the
exodus
of
the
mormon
people
from
the
state
of
illinois
to
the
then
little
known
region
of
the
rocky
mountain
west
the
leaders
of
that
people
had
decided
that
there
was
little
prospect
of
their
being
able
to
live
in
peace
with
their
neighbors
in
illinois
or
in
any
of
the
surrounding
states
owing
to
the
existence
of
strong
prejudices
against
their
religion
and
therefore
they
resolved
upon
seeking
a
new
home
in
the
west
within
the
basin
of
the
great
salt
lake
or
bear
river
valley
believing
that
to
be
a
point
where
a
good
living
will
require
hard
labor
and
consequently
will
be
coveted
by
no
other
people
while
it
is
surrounded
by
so
unpopulous
but
fertile
a
country
a
mormon
appeal
to
the
united
states
government
for
before
the
exodus
from
illinois
began
as
early
as
the
of
january
the
high
council
at
nauvoo
made
public
announcement
of
the
intention
of
the
mormon
people
to
move
to
some
good
valley
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
in
the
event
of
president
polk
recommendation
to
build
block
houses
and
stockade
forts
on
the
route
to
oregon
becoming
a
law
we
have
encouragement
they
said
of
having
that
work
to
do
and
under
our
peculiar
circumstances
we
can
do
it
with
less
expense
to
the
government
than
any
other
people
b
six
days
later
jesse
little
was
appointed
by
the
mormon
church
authorities
president
of
the
eastern
states
mission
and
in
his
letter
of
appointment
was
instructed
as
follows
if
our
government
shall
offer
any
facilities
for
emigrating
to
the
western
coast
embrace
those
facilities
if
possible
as
a
wise
and
faithful
man
take
every
honorable
advantage
of
the
times
you
can
c
in
consonance
with
my
instructions
says
little
in
his
report
to
brigham
young
which
is
recorded
in
the
latter
manuscript
history
i
resolved
upon
visiting
james
polk
president
of
the
united
states
to
lay
the
situation
of
my
brethren
before
him
and
ask
him
as
the
representative
of
our
country
to
stretch
forth
the
federal
arm
in
their
behalf
in
pursuance
of
this
design
little
obtained
a
letter
of
introduction
from
john
steel
governor
of
new
hampshire
in
which
state
little
had
been
reared
the
governor
in
his
letter
declared
that
he
had
known
little
from
childhood
and
believed
him
honest
in
his
views
and
intentions
and
added
little
visits
washington
if
i
understand
him
correctly
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
or
endeavoring
to
procure
the
freight
of
any
provisions
or
naval
stores
which
the
government
may
be
desirous
of
sending
to
oregon
or
to
any
portion
of
the
pacific
he
is
thus
desirous
of
obtaining
freight
for
the
purpose
of
lessening
the
expense
of
chartering
vessels
to
convey
him
and
his
followers
to
california
where
they
intend
going
and
making
a
permanent
settlement
the
present
summer
d
from
luke
milber
also
of
petersboro
little
secured
a
letter
to
hon
mace
moulton
in
washington
which
in
addition
to
vouching
for
the
high
character
of
little
based
upon
personal
knowledge
of
him
for
twelve
years
announced
that
he
was
soliciting
some
aid
from
the
general
government
to
assist
himself
and
brethren
throughout
the
united
states
in
emigrating
to
california
in
may
of
the
same
year
at
a
church
conference
held
in
philadelphia
little
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
kanes
they
were
an
old
and
honorable
pennsylvania
family
the
father
judge
john
kane
had
been
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
at
the
time
of
little
visit
at
his
home
he
was
united
states
judge
for
the
district
of
pennsylvania
also
president
of
the
american

society
elisha

kane
the
famous
arctic

was

son
as
was
also
thomas

who
afterward
served
with
distinction
as
colonel
and
brigadier
general
in
the
union
army
in
the
war
between
the
states
from
the
latter
little
received
a
letter
of
introduction
to
hon
geo
dallas
of
the
united
states
he
visits
washington
said
kane
letter
to
dallas
with
no
other
object
than
the
laudable
one
of
desiring
aid
of
the
government
for
his
people
consultation
with
the
the
arrival
of
little
at
washington
on
the
of
may
was
most
opportune
for
the
business
he
had
in
hand
he
called
upon
president
polk
that
same
evening
in
company
with
a
dame
of
massachusetts
and
king
a
representative
of
the
same
state
sam
houston
of
texas
and
other
distinguished
gentlemen
were
present
news
of
the
capture
of
an
american
reconnoitering
troop
of
dragoons
under
command
of
captain
thornton
on
the
east
side
of
the
rio
grande
sixteen
of
whom
were
killed
had
reached
washington
early
in
may
and
enabled
the
president
in
his
message
to
congress
on
the
of
that
month
to
say
that
mexico
had
invaded
our
territory
and
shed
the
blood
of
our
citizens
on
our
own
soil
which
led
congress
two
days
later
to
declare
war
and
vote
the
funds
necessary
to
its
vigorous
prosecution
by
the
time
little
called
upon
the
president
the
news
had
reached
washington
of
the
victory
of
the
american
forces
under
general
taylor
at
the
battles
of
palo
alto
and
resaca
de
la
palma
fought
on
the
and
of
may
respectively
news
of
these
victories
aroused
the
war
spirit
throughout
the
land
e
and
hastened
all
the
government
schemes
for
prosecuting
the
war
including
the
plan
of
gathering
the
army
of
the
west
at
fort
leavenworth
under
stephen
kearny
to
invade
new
mexico
and
ultimately
with
the
pacific
fleet
which
it
was
designed
should
sweep
round
cape
horn
and
attack
on
the
pacific
coast
of
mexico
f
it
was
with
this
army
of
the
west
that
the
mormon
battalion
was
destined
to
be
connected
little
a
few
days
later
was
informed
by
his
friends
in
washington
that
the
plan
for
the
mormon
participation
in
this
movement
to
the
west
discussed
by
the
president
and
his
cabinet
was
for
little
to
go
directly
to
the
camps
of
the
mormon
people
in
the
west
and
have
one
thousand
men
fitted
out
and
plunge
into
california
officered
by
their
own
men
the
commanding
officer
to
be
appointed
by
president
polk
and
to
send
one
thousand
more
by
way
of
cape
horn
who
will
take
cannon
and
everything
needed
in
preparing
defense
those
by
land
to
receive
pay
from
the
time
little
should
see
them
and
those
going
by
water
from
september
first
g
at
this
point
little
seems
to
have
taken
up
the
matter
personally
and
directly
with
the
president
and
under
date
of
june
addressed
an
appeal
to
him
in
it
little
expresses
confidence
in
the
president
else
he
would
not
have
left
his
home
to
ask
favors
of
him
for
his
people
the
mormons
he
gave
an
account
of
himself
and
his
forefathers
who
fought
in
the
battles
of
the
revolution
of
his
own
character
vouched
for
by
his
letters
of
introduction
from
men
of
high
standing
and
then
avers
that
the

the
mormon
captain
allen
arrived
at
mount
pisgah
on
the
of
june
accompanied
by
three
dragoons
and
presented
to
the
leading
men
of
that
place
a
circular
to
the
mormons
in
harmony
with
his
instructions
the
presiding
brethren
at
mount
pisgah
did
not
feel
authorized
to
take
any
steps
in
the
matter
of
captain
communication
on
the
enlistment
of
a
battalion
but
gave
him
a
letter
of
introduction
to
president
young
at
council
bluffs
for
which
place
the
captain
started
immediately
and
arrived
on
the
of
june
the
following
day
he
met
with
president
young
and
others
in
council
and
presented
the
whole
question
of
raising
a
battalion
from
the
mormon
camps
the
question
arose
in
the
minds
of
the
mormon
leaders
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
camps
which
would
be
materially
crippled
by
the
withdrawal
of
so
many
young
strong
and
men
already
the
question
of
wintering
the
camps
and
caring
for
so
large
an
amount
of
stock
possessed
by
them
loomed
large
among
their
difficulties
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
west
in
la
platte
river
was
grand
island
miles
long
with
an
average
width
of
a
mile
and
and
well
timbered
in
the
neighborhood
of
which
also
were
immense
areas
of
grass
that
might
be
cut
for
hay
and
the
rank
growth
of
rushes
here
and
there
along
the
extensive
river
bottoms
would
enable
much
of
the
stock
to
winter
on
this
range
could
government
permission
be
obtained
for
a
large
contingent
of
the
camp
to
be
stationed
there
this
country
as
well
as
the
one
the
camps
were
then
occupying
was
within
the
louisiana
purchase
and
largely
divided
into
indian
reservations
hence
could
only
be
occupied
by
the
whites
by
permission
of
the
government
the
question
of
government
permission
therefore
in
the
event
of
the
battalion
being
raised
was
submitted
to
captain
allen
and
he
assumed
the
responsibility
of
saying
that
the
camps
might
locate
on
grand
island
until
they
could
prosecute
their
journey
in
his
speech
made
to
the
camp
the
same
day
the
captain
promised
to
write
president
polk
to
give
leave
to
the
mormon
camps
to
stay
on
their
route
wherever
it
was
necessary
at
a
council
meeting
held
later
in
the
day
on
brigham
young
asking
captain
allen
if
an
officer
enlisting
men
in
an
had
not
a
right
to
say
to
their
families
you
can
stay
till
your
husbands
return
the
captain
replied
that
he
was
the
representative
of
president
polk
and
could
act
till
he
notified
the
president
who
might
ratify
his
engagements
or
indemnify
for
damages
the
president
might
give
permission
to
travel
through
the
indian
country
and
stop
whenever
and
wherever
circumstances
required
l
after
the
first
council
meeting
between
captain
allen
and
the
mormon
leaders
a
public
meeting
was
held
at
noon
on
the
same
day
brigham
young
introduced
captain
allen
who
addressed
the
people
he
said
he
was
sent
by
stephen
kearny
through
the
benevolence
of
jas
polk
president
of
the
united
states
to
enlist
five
hundred
of
our
men
that
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
volunteers
ready
to
enlist
in
the
states
he
read
his
order
from
kearny
and
the
circular
which
he
himself
had
issued
from
mount
pisgah
and
explained
m
the
statement
of
captain
allen
that
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
volunteers
ready
to
enlist
in
the
states
was
quite
true
the
declaration
of
war
upon
mexico
by
the
congress
authorized
the
president
to
accept
the
service
of
fifty
thousand
volunteers
and
placed
ten
millions
of
dollars
at
his
disposal
the
call
for
volunteers
was
answered
by
the
prompt
tender
of
the
service
of
more
than
men
n
four
regiments
were
called
for
from
illinois
nine
answered
the
call
numbering
only
four
of
them
numbering
men
could
be
taken
o
young
activities
in
raising
the
brigham
young
followed
captain
allen
in
an
address
at
the
aforesaid
meeting
his
own
account
of
his
remarks
stand
in
his
history
as
follows
i
addressed
the
assembly
wished
them
to
make
a
distinction
between
this
action
of
the
general
government
and
our
former
oppressions
in
missouri
and
illinois
i
said
the
question
might
be
asked
is
it
prudent
for
us
to
enlist
to
defend
our
country
if
we
answer
in
the
affirmative
all
are
ready
to
go
suppose
we
were
admitted
into
the
union
as
a
state
and
the
government
did
not
call
on
us
we
would
feel
ourselves
neglected
let
the
mormons
be
the
first
to
set
their
feet
on
the
soil
of
california
captain
allen
has
assumed
the
responsibility
of
saying
that
we
may
locate
on
grand
island
until
we
can
prosecute
our
journey
this
is
the
first
offer
we
have
ever
had
from
the
government
to
benefit
us
i
proposed
that
the
five
hundred
volunteers
be
mustered
and
i
would
do
my
best
to
see
all
their
families
brought
forward
as
far
as
my
influence
extended
and
feed
them
when
i
had
anything
to
eat
myself
p
at
the
close
of
the
public
meeting
another
council
meeting
was
held
with
captain
allen
present
when
the
question
of
the
people
having
a
right
to
remain
on
indian
lands
during
the
absence
of
the
soldiers
and
indeed
along
their
whole
route
of
travel
was
further
considered
captain
allen
withdrew
from
the
council
and
the
twelve
says
brigham
young
continued
to
converse
on
the
favorable
prospect
before
us
q
it
was
arranged
that
brigham
young
should
go
to
mount
pisgah
to
raise
volunteers
for
the
battalion
and
that
other
leaders
should
prosecute
the
work
of
raising
volunteers
in
the
camps
about
council
bluffs
there
was
apparently
some
reluctance
among
the
people
to
respond
to
this
unexpected
call
and
it
required
some
considerable
persuasion
to
dispel
it
on
the
of
july
thomas
kane
reached
the
mormon
camps
at
council
bluffs
and
gave
assurance
that
the
general
government
had
taken
the
mormon
case
into
consideration
inferentially
with
benevolent
intentions
r
when
within
eleven
miles
of
mount
pisgah
brigham
young
and
heber
kimball
met
jesse
little
president
of
the
eastern
states
mission
who
reported
his
labors
at
washington
his
written
report
was
incorporated
in
brigham
young
history
for
that
year
while
at
pisgah
brigham
young
wrote
the
camp
at
garden
grove
and
sent
his
letter
by
special
messenger
after
describing
the
terms
of
enlistment
and
the
conditions
under
which
the
volunteers
would
be
mustered
out
of
service
in
california
he
said
they
may
stay
in
california
look
out
the
best
locations
for
themselves
and
their
friends
and
defend
the
country
this
is
no
hoax
little
president
of
the
new
england
churches
is
here
direct
from
washington
who
has
been
to
see
the
president
on
the
subject
of
emigrating
the
saints
to
the
western
coast
and
confirms
all
that
captain
allen
has
stated
to
us
the
united
states
want
our
friendship
the
president
wants
to
do
us
good
and
secure
our
confidence
the
outfit
of
this
five
hundred
men
costs
us
nothing
and
their
pay
will
be
sufficient
to
take
their
families
over
the
mountains
there
is
war
between
mexico
and
the
united
states
to
whom
california
must
fall
a
prey
and
if
we
are
the
first
settlers
the
old
citizens
can
not
have
a
hancock
county
or
missouri
pretext
to
mob
the
saints
the
thing
is
from
above
for
our
good
a
letter
of
like
spirit
was
sent
by
brigham
young
to
the
trustees
at
nauvoo
in
that
letter
the
following
passage
occurs
this
is
the
first
time
the
government
has
stretched
forth
its
arm
to
our
assistance
and
we
receive
their
proffers
with
joy
and
thankfulness
we
feel
confident
they
the
battalion
will
have
little
or
no
fighting
the
pay
of
the
five
hundred
men
will
take
their
families
to
them
the
mormons
will
then
be
the
old
settlers
and
have
a
chance
to
choose
the
best
locations
s
of
the
when
brigham
young
returned
from
mount
pisgah
a
public
meeting
was
held
on
the
of
july
and
the
final
work
of
enrollment
of
the
battalion
began
at
the
opening
meeting
brigham
young
said
if
we
want
the
privilege
of
going
where
we
can
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
our
conscience
we
must
raise
the
battalion
i
say
it
is
right
and
who
cares
for
sacrificing
our
comfort
for
a
few
years
i
would
rather
have
undertaken
to
raise
a
year
ago
in
hours
than
in
one
week
now
t
later
he
said
to
the
mustering
companies
you
could
not
ask
for
anything
more
acceptable
than
this
mission
u
an
american
flag
flag
of
the
united
states
brought
out
from
the
of
things
rescued
in
the
mormon
exodus
from
illinois
was
hoisted
to
a
tree
mast
and
under
it
the
enrollment
took
place
v
the
enrollment
of
the
battalion
was
completed
on
the
of
july
and
that
day
captain
allen
took
the
organization
under
his
command
there
was
no
sentimental
affectation
at
their
remarks
kane
in
his
account
of
the
departure
of
the
battalion
from
the
camps
the
afternoon
before
their
departure
a

advantages
and
disadvantages
to
the
mormons
arising
from
the
enlistment
of
the
battalion
the
call
for
the
mormon
battalion
was
not
an
unfriendly
act
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
government
towards
the
mormon
people
a
representative
of
the
church
as
we
have
seen
had
appealed
most
earnestly
to
the
executive
of
the
nation
for
aid
in
the
western
emigrations
of
that
people
and
when
it
was
decided
by
the
administration
to
accept
the
services
of
such
a
force
of
volunteers
the
mormon
leaders
received
the
decision
as
an
answer
to
their
appeal
for
aid
sacrifice
but
notwithstanding
the
government
service
was
asked
for
by
the
representative
of
the
mormon
people
and
the
granting
of
it
was
regarded
by
the
mormon
leaders
at
the
time
as
a
great
advantage
to
their
people
it
brought
to
the
volunteers
and
to
the
people
generally
much
of
sacrifice
for
one
thing
the
opportunity
to
avail
themselves
of
their
tendered
service
to
the
government
came
at
an
unexpected
and
a
most
inconvenient
time
as
explained
afterwards
by
kane
the
young
and
those
who
could
best
have
been
spared
were
then
away
from
the
main
body
either
with
pioneer
companies
in
the
van
or
their
faith
unannounced
seeking
work
and
food
about
the
northwest
settlements
to
support
them
till
the
return
of
the
season
for
commencing
emigration
the
force
was
therefore
to
be
recruited
from
among
the
fathers
of
families
and
others
whose
presence
it
was
most
desirable
to
retain
a
practically
five
hundred
wagons
were
left
without
teamsters
and
as
many
families
were
left
without
their
natural
protectors
and
providers
the
families
of
the
battalion
with
the
families
of
their
friends
in
whose
care
they
must
leave
their
loved
ones
and
upon
whom
they
must
depend
for
succor
were
then
scattered
in
a
string
of
camps
for
some
hundreds
of
miles
between
nauvoo
and
council
bluffs
with
no
certain
abiding
place
designated
and
no
immediate
prospect
of
being
permanently
settled
to
volunteer
for
a
of
two
thousand
miles
much
of
which
was
desert
under
such
circumstances
was
doubly
hard
moreover
the
mormon
people
from
their
then
point
of
view
had
little
to
be
grateful
for
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
their
appeals
from
what
to
them
was
the
injustice
of
missouri
and
illinois
had
met
with
but
cold
reception
at
washington
they
did
not
and
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
much
less
sympathize
with
the
refinements
employed
by
the
national
legislators
in
drawing
nice
distinctions
about
the
division
of
sovereignty
between
the
states
and
the
general
government
they
were
of
wrongs
inflicted
upon
their
community
in
the
two
states
in
which
they
had
settled
missouri
and
illinois
they
had
appealed
to
the
general
government
for
a
redress
of
those
grievances
without
avail
and
now
they
were
asked
by
their
leaders
to
go
into
the
service
of
that
government
which
might
mean
the
sacrifice
of
life
and
surely
meant
the
abandonment
of
their
families
to
the
care
of
others
under
circumstances
the
most
trying
to
respond
to
the
call
made
upon
them
both
as
to
the
volunteers
and
the
camped
community
whence
they
were
mustered
was
a
manifestation
of
unselfishness
not
often
paralleled
in
history
of
the
notwithstanding
all
the
sacrifices
involved
brigham
young
and
those
associated
with
him
were
too
astute
as
leaders
not
to
appreciate
the
advantages
of
having
a
considerable
number
of
their
people
to
enter
the
service
of
the
united
states
the
charge
of
disloyalty
to
the
american
government
had
often
been
made
against
the
mormons
which
not
all
their
protests
and
denials
could
overcome
but
to
enter
the
service
of
the
government
in
a
time
of
war
involving
such
inconveniences
as
must
be
theirs
would
be
an
evidence
of
loyalty
that
would
stand
forever
both
unimpeached
and
unimpeachable
that
such
was
the
understanding
of
brigham
young
is
specifically
expressed
by
him
about
a
month
after
the
departure
of
the
battalion
let
every
one
distinctly
understand
said
he
that
the
mormon
battalion
was
organized
from
our
camp
to
allay
the
prejudices
of
the
people
prove
our
loyalty
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
for
the
present
and
temporal
salvation
of
israel
that
this
act
left
near
five
hundred
teams
destitute
of
drivers
and
provisions
for
the
winter
and
nearly
as
many
families
without
protection
and
help
b
right
to
settle
on
indian
lands
another
advantage
appealed
to
the
leaders
it
had
become
evident
before
the
call
was
made
for
the
battalion
that
while
it
might
be
possible
for
a
specially
organized
pioneer
company
to
go
over
the
mountains
that
season
preparations
for
which
were
being
rapidly
made
the
very
great
majority
of
the
camps
would
be
under
the
necessity
of
spending
a
year
or
more
in
southern
iowa
principally
on
indian
lands
the
prospects
of
remaining
upon
such
lands
in
peace
would
be
much
enhanced
if
it
could
be
pleaded
that
five
hundred
of
their
men
were
in
the
service
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
subsequent
events
demonstrated
the
validity
of
such
a
plea
also
it
was
the
advantage
sought
to
be
secured
by
brigham
young
in
his
first
conference
with
captain
allen
on
the
subject
of
the
enlistment
of
the
battalion
under
these
arrangements
of
occupancy
as
the
indian
titles
in
lands
in
iowa
expired
the
mormon
occupants
acquired
valuable
rights
up
and
down
the
missouri
river
from
council
bluffs
for
a
distance
of
between
fifty
and
sixty
miles
stretching
back
on
the
east
side
of
said
river
some
thirty
or
forty
miles
c
value
of
the
another
consideration
of
importance
was
the
remuneration
of
these
soldiers
a
year
pay
for
their
clothing
in
advance
at
the
rate
of
per
man
per
month
would
amount
to
each
and
to
for
the
battalion
deciding
to
make
their
march
in
the
clothing
they
had
when
enlisting
part
of
their
money
for
clothing
was
sent
back
from
fort
leavenworth
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
families
of
the
battalion
and
part
of
it
to
assist
the
mormon
leaders
subsequently
agents
were
secretly
sent
to
santa
fe
to
bring
back
to
the
camps
the
pay
of
the
soldiers
that
had
accrued
by
the
time
they
had
arrived
there
this
amounted
to
three
months
pay
at
the
following
rates
captain
per
month
rations
cents
per
day
first
lieutenant
per
month
rations
cents
per

second
lieutenant

cents
per
day
first
sergeant
per
month
sergeants
per
month
corporals
per

musicians
per

and
privates

the
payment
at
santa
fe
was
made
in
government
checks
not
very
available
at
santa
fe
not
easily
negotiable
writes
col
cooke
d
it
has
often
been
claimed
that
the
battalion
was
paid
a
bounty
per
man
on
entering
the
service
this
was
not
the
case
the
payment
for
clothing
one
year
in
advance
at
the
rate
of
per
month
has
been
mistaken
for
bounty
e
it
was
only
by
foregoing
the
purchase
of
clothing
that
the
battalion
could
send
the
payment
for
it
to
their
families
and
to
the
mormon
leaders
this
source
of
revenue
to
the
camps
was
accounted
a
very
great
blessing
at
the
time
in
official
letters
to
the
battalion
from
the
mormon
leaders
under
date
of
august
and
respectively
it
was
said
in
the
first
that
the
battalion
had
been
placed
in
circumstances
which
enabled
them
to
control
more
means
than
all
the
rest
of
the
mormon
people
in
the
wilderness
in
the
second
brigham
young
said
we
consider
the
money
you
have
received
as
compensation
for
your
clothing
a
peculiar
manifestation
of
the
kind
providence
of
our
heavenly
father
at
this
particular
time
which
is
just
the
time
for
the
purchasing
of
provisions
and
goods
for
the
winter
supply
of
the
camp
f
equipment
of
the
battalion
to
be
in
addition
to
this
payment
for
clothing
and
the
monthly
pay
there
was
the
five
hundred
stand
of
arms
and
camp
equipment
which
were
to
become
the
personal
property
of
the
men
when
discharged
in
california
these
several
considerations
led
john
taylor
who
became
the
successor
to
brigham
young
in
mormon
leadership
in
an
address
to
the
mormons
in
england
to
say
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
favorably
disposed
to
us
he
has
sent
out
orders
to
have
five
hundred
of
our
brethren
employed
for
one
year
in
an
expedition
that
was
fitting
out
against
california
with
orders
for
them
to
be
employed
for
one
year
and
when
to
be
discharged
in
california
and
to
have
their
arms
and
implements
of
war
given
to
them
at
the
expiration
of
the
term
and
as
there
is
no
prospect
of
any
opposition
it
amounts
to
the
same
as
paying
them
for
going
to
the
place
where
they
were
destined
to
go
without
g
of
mormon
in
a
letter
to
president
polk
under
date
of
august
after
reminding
the
president
of
the
disadvantages
the
mormon
camps
experienced
in
raising
the
battalion
brigham
young
said
but
in
the
midst
of
this
we
were
cheered
with
the
presence
of
our
friend
little
of
new
hampshire
who
assures
us
of
the
personal
friendship
of
the
president
in
the
act
before
us
and
this
assurance
though
not
doubted
by
us
in

least
was
soon
made
doubly
sure

while

would
remain
a
few
days
recuperate
and
overtake
them
he
died
on
the
much
lamented
by
the
battalion
which
had
become
warmly
attached
to
him
commenting
upon
his
demise
the
author
of
the
doniphan
expedition
william
connelly
says
thus
died
allen
of
the
first
dragoons
in
the
midst
of
a
career
of
usefulness
under
the
favoring
smiles
of
fortune
beloved
while
living
regretted
after
death
by
all
who
knew
him
both
among
the
volunteers
and
the
troops
on
the
death
of
allen
the
question
of
succession
in
command
was
considered
it
appears
that
this
subject
was
mooted
at
the
time
the
companies
of
the
battalion
were
enlisted
and
allen
repeatedly
stated
to
us
says
brigham
young
that
there
would
be
no
officer
in
the
battalion
except
himself
only
from
among
our
people
that
if
he
fell
in
battle
or
was
sick
or
disabled
by
any
means
the
command
would
devolve
on
the
ranking
officer
which
would
be
the
captain
of
company
and
and
so
on
according
to
letter
the
battalion
appears
to
have
had
the
same
understanding
for
at
a
council
meeting
of
the
officers
it
was
agreed
by
them
that
captain
jefferson
hunt
of
company
a
should
assume
command
which
decision
was
afterwards
sustained
by
the
unanimous
vote
of
the
men
meantime
however
major
horton
in
command
at
fort
leavenworth
sent
lieutenant
smith
of
the
regular
army
to
take
command
of
the
battalion
this
led
to
a
threatened
complication
for
an
appeal
to
such
written
military
authorities
as
were
available
to
the
officers
of
the
battalion
left
them
hopelessly
divided
in
their
conclusions
on
the
arrival
of
lieutenant
smith
a
council
of
officers
was
held
in
which
the
battalion
officers
demanded
to
know
what
reasons
existed
for
their
acceptance
of
him
as
commander
rather
than
captain
hunt
to
which
it
was
answered
that
the
government
property
in
possession
of
the
battalion
was
not
yet
receipted
for
but
that
lieutenant
smith
could
receipt
for
it
and
being
a
commissioned
officer
of
the
regular
army
he
would
be
known
at
washington
and
his
actions
and
orders
recognized
whereas
the
officers
of
the
battalion
had
not
yet
received
their
commissions
and
it
would
be
doubtful
if
their
selection
of
a
commander
would
be
approved
after
this
discussion
captain
hunt
submitted
the
matter
to
the
officers
and
all
but
three
voted
in
favor
of
accepting
lieutenant
smith
as
the
commander
of
the
battalion
of
the
with
lieutenant
smith
had
come
george
sanderson
whom
allen
at
leavenworth
had
appointed
a
surgeon
in
the
army
to
serve
with
the
mormon
battalion
according
to
the
historian
of
the
battalion
a
the
volunteers
suffered
much
because
of
the
arrogance
inefficiency
and
petty
oppressions
of
these
two
officers
this
view
of
these
officers
however
is
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
volunteers
being
suddenly
brought
under
the
enforced
discipline
of
the
army
regulations
the
heat
of
the
season
was
excessive
the
men
had
been
already
much
exhausted
by
the
strenuous
labor
and
exposure
during
the
journey
through
iowa
with
their
people
earlier
in
the
season
and
as
a
result
many
of
them
fell
a
prey
to
the
malaria
prevalent
in
the
country
and
at
this
season
of
the
year
for
this
sanderson
prescribed
calomel
and
arsenic
and
as
the
men
were
averse
to
taking
medicine
pleading
even
religious
scruples
against
the
drugs
the
matter
gave
rise
to
much
unpleasantness
between
the
battalion
physician
and
the
command
involving
therein
lieutenant
smith
who
in
the
interest
of
what
he
no
doubt
regarded
as
discipline
sided
with
the
physician
line
of
the
battalion
line
of
march
from
fort
leavenworth
after
crossing
the
kaw
or
kansas
river
followed
that
of
the
first
missouri
dragoons
led
over
the
route
that
same
year
by
doniphan
via
council
grove
thence
some
distance
up
the
arkansas
river
to
a
little
beyond
fort
mann
where
they
crossed
that
river
in
order
to
take
what
was
known
as
the
cimmeron
route
because
it
crossed
cimmeron
river
and
followed
some
distance
up
the
south
branch
of
the
stream
called
cimmeron
creek
the
last
crossing
of
the
arkansas
they
reached
on
the
of
september
and
here
the
commanding
officer
insisted
that
most
of
the
families
about
twelve
or
fifteen
in
number
which
had
so
far
accompanied
the
battalion
should
be
detached
and
sent
under
a
guard
of
ten
men
up
the
arkansas
to
pueblo
which
nestles
at
the
east
base
of
the
rocky
mountain
range
there
were
stout
protests
against
this
division
of
the
battalion
as
it
was
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
promise
that
the
battalion
would
not
be
divided
also
that
these
families
should
be
permitted
to
travel
with
the
battalion
to
california
unquestionably
however
the
arrangement
was
in
the
best
interests
both
of
the
families
and
of
the
battalion
and
accordingly
the
detachment
was
made
up
as
proposed
and
marched
to
pueblo
under
command
of
captain
nelson
higgins
at
santa
fe
condition
of
the
the
main
body
of
the
command
continued
its
march
to
san
miguel
thence
turning
the
point
of
a
mountain
range
marched
north
westward
to
santa
fe
where
they
arrived
in
two
detachments
on
the
and
of
october
respectively
upon
the
arrival
of
the
first
detachment
the
battalion
was
received
by
a
salute
of
one
hundred
guns
by
order
of
doniphan
b
then
in
command
both
as
civil
and
military
head
of
the
department
of
new
mexico
but
making
ready
for
what
was
to
be
his
great
and
historic
march
upon
chihuahua
on
the
arrival
of
the
battalion
at
santa
fe
it
was
learned
that
general
kearny
previous
to
his
departure
for
the
west
had
designated
george
cooke
c
to
take
command
of
the
battalion
and
to
follow
on
his
trail
with
wagons
to
california
speaking
of
the
condition
of
the
battalion
on
its
arrival
in
santa
fe
and
remarking
on
its
physical
unfitness
to
undertake
the
march
to
california
cooke
in
his
conquest
of
new
mexico
says
everything
conspired
to
discourage
the
extraordinary
undertaking
of
marching
this
battalion
eleven
hundred
miles
for
the
much
greater
part
through
an
unknown
wilderness
without
road
or
trail
and
with
a
wagon
train
it
was
enlisted
too
much
by
families
some
were
too
old
and
feeble
and
some
too
young
it
was
embarrassed
by
many
women
it
was
undisciplined
it
was
much
worn
by
traveling
on
foot
and
marching
from
nauvoo
illinois
their
clothing
was
very
scant
there
was
no
money
to
pay
them
or
clothing
to
issue
their
mules
were
utterly
broken
down
the
quartermaster
department
was
without
funds
and
its
credit
bad
and
animals
were
scarce
those
procured
were
very
inferior
and
were
deteriorating
every
hour
for
lack
of
forage
or
grazing
d
so
every
preparation
must
be
pushed
hurried
a
small
party
with
families
had
been
sent
from
arkansas
crossing
up
the
river
to
winter
at
a
small
settlement
close
to
the
mountains
called
pueblo
the
battalion
was
now
inspected
and
men
found
inefficient
were
ordered
under
two
officers
with
nearly
all
the
women
to
go
to
the
same
point
five
wives
of
officers
were
reluctantly
allowed
to
accompany
the
march
but
furnished
their
own
transportation
by
special
arrangement
and
consent
the
battalion
was
paid
in
checks
not
very
available
at
santa
fe
negotiable
with
every
effort
the
quartermaster
could
only
undertake
to
furnish
rations
for
sixty
days
and
in
fact
full
rations
of
only
flour
sugar
coffee
and
salt
salt
pork
only
for
thirty
days
and
soap
for
twenty
to
venture
without
would
be
grossly
imprudent
and
so
that
burden
was
added
e
detachment
sent
to
it
was
understood
that
the
men
invalided
and
their
escort
together
with
the
women
and
children
belonging
to
the
battalion
would
have
the
privilege
in
the

of
intercepting
the
main
body
of
their
people
moving
to
the

and
going
with
them
at

expense
f
the

the
result
of

of
excessive

cause

so
many
men
breaking
down
in

was
the
excessive
toil
at
the

stretches

began
early
in
the

from

while
yet
in

continuing
along
the
whole
route
to
and
through
the
california
desert
lying
between

the
coast
range
of
mountains
our
course
now
lay
down
the
rio
del
norte
the
rio
grande
says
sergeant
tyler
we
found
the
roads
extremely
sandy
in
many
places
and
the
men
while
carrying
blankets
knapsacks
cartridge
boxes
each
containing
rounds
of
ammunition
and
muskets
on
their
backs
and
living
on
short
rations
had
to
pull
at
long
ropes
to
aid
the
teams
the
deep
sand
alone
without
any
load
was
enough
to
wear
out
both
man
and
beast
later
he
remarks
we
had
to
leave
the
river
for
a
time
and
have
twenty
men
to
each
wagon
with
long
ropes
to
help
the
teams
pull
the
wagons
over
the
sand
hills
the
commander
perched
himself
on
one
of
the
hills
like
a
hawk
on
a
fence
post
sending
down
his
orders
with
the
sharpness
of
well
to
the
battalion
it
is
enough
to
say
colonel
cooke
one
of
the
battalion
celebrates
this
incident
of
the
march
in
doggerel
verse
of
which
two
stanzas
follow
our
hardships
reach
their
rough
extremes
when
valiant
men
are
roped
with
teams
hour
after
hour
and
day
by
day
to
wear
our
strength
and
lives
away
we
see
some
twenty
men
or
more
with
empty
stomachs
and
foot
sore
bound
to
one
wagon
plodding
on
through
sand
beneath
a
burning
sun
b
in
the
trackless
part
of
the
battalion
march
through
the
sand
stretches
in
addition
to
pulling
at
the
wagons
companies
marched
in
file
in
each
other
footsteps
to
make
tracks
for
the
wagon
wheels
in
new
it
was
while
at
santa
fe
and
while
passing
down
the
rio
del
norte
that
the
battalion
saw
for
the
first
time
irrigation
in
operation
tyler
thus
describes
it
canals
for
irrigation
purposes
were
found
all
along
the
banks
of
the
river
some
of
them
several
miles
in
length
they
conveyed
water
to
the
farms
or
as
they
were
called
in
that
country
ranchos
there
being
little
or
no
rain
during
the
growing
season
the
water
was
made
to
flow
over
the
ground
until
it
was
sufficiently
saturated
and
then
shut
off
until
needed
again
for
the
same
purpose
down
the
rio
as
the
command
in
its
southward
movement
down
the
rio
grande
reached
the
point
where
general
kearny
left
the
valley
for
a
direct
march
westward
miles
south
of
santa
fe
and
where
too
kearny
had
abandoned
his
wagons
the
guides
declared
it
impossible
to
follow
the
gila
route
proper
with
the
wagons
and
hence
a
circuit
to
the
south
through
sonora
via
janos
and
fronteras
was
proposed
and
determined
upon
at
a
council
of
officers
in
the
first
stages
of
this
changed
course
however
the
road
bore
to
the
southeast
and
this
was
not
to
the
liking
of
cooke
because
it
would
carry
his
command
within
hailing
distance
of
general
wool
who
might
incorporate
it
in
the
army
of
the
centre
as
the
division
of
the
invading
forces
against
mexico
was
called
to
operate
against
chihuahua
in
that
event
as
the
colonel
himself
expressed
it
he
would
lose
his
trip
to
california
to
bear
to
the
southeast
was
not
to
the
liking
of
the
battalion
as
that
was
not
in
the
direction
of
california
but
one
which
might
lead
them
within
the
sphere
of
the
army
of
the
centre
and
they
would
find
themselves
discharged
in
old
mexico
instead
of
california
at
the
end
of
their
term
of
enlistment
the
entire
command
was
thrown
into
gloom
by
this
change
in
the
line
of
march
all
of
our
hopes
conversations
and
songs
says
the
historian
of
the
battalion
tyler
were
centered
on
california
somewhere
on
that
broad
domain
we
expected
to
join
our
families
and
friends
blow
the
right
the
westward
on
the
morning
of
the
says
tyler
the
command
resumed
its
journey
marching
in
a
southern
direction
for
about
two
miles
when
it
was
found
that
the
road
began
to
bear
southeast
instead
of
southwest
as
stated
by
the
guides
the
colonel
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
road
then
to
the
southwest
then
to
the
west
saying
do
want
to
get
under
general
wool
and
lose
my
trip
to
california
he
arose
in
his
saddle
and
ordered
a
halt
he
then
said
with
firmness
is
not
my
course
i
was
ordered
to
california
he
added
with
an
oath
will
go
there
or
die
in
the
attempt
then
turning
to
the
bugler
he
said
the
right
turning
westward
at
this
point
north
latitude
and
but
a
short
distance
some
thirty
miles
north
of
the
present
city
of
el
paso
the
course
of
march
was
westward
to
san
bernardino
rancho
thence
to
yanos
and
so
to
the
san
pedro
river
where
the
command
arrived
on
the
of
december
fight
with
wild
here
occurred
the
only
fighting
the
battalion
engaged
in
on
its
expedition
a
battle
with
wild
bulls
this
section
of
the
country
seemed
to
abound
with
herds
of
wild
cattle
and
the
males
among
them
were
much
more
bold
and
ferocious
than
among
the
buffalos
attracted
by
curiosity
these
herds
gathered
along
the
line
of
march
alternately
scampering
away
and
approaching
and
some
of
the
bolder
ones
as
if
in
resentment
of
the
battalion
invasion
attacked
the
column
several
mules
were
gored
to
death
by
them
both
in
the
teams
and
among
the
pack
animals
and
colonel
cooke
records
how
some
of
the
wagons
were
thrown
about
by
the
mad
charge
of
these
furious
beasts
the
troops
had
been
ordered
to
march
with
guns
unloaded
but
in
the
presence
of
such
a
danger
the
men
loaded
their
muskets
without
waiting
for
an
order
to
that
effect
and
when
attacked
would
fire
upon
the
charging
beasts
so
that
the
rattle
of
musketry
was
for
once
heard
all
along
the
line
the
bulls
were
very
tenacious
of
life
however
and
more
desperate
and
dangerous
when
wounded
than
before
tyler
speaks
of
one
fight
between
william
spencer
and
a
bull
which
was
shot
five
times
twice
through
the
lungs
twice
through
the
heart
and
once
through
the
head
and
yet
would
alternately
rise
and
fall
and
rush
upon
the
doctor
until
a
sixth
ball
between

colonel
cooke
confirms
narrative
about
the
bull
continuing
to
rush
on
after
being
twice
shot
through
the
heart
and
adds
i
have
seen
the
heart
cooke
also
relates
the
feat
of
corporal
frost
in
bringing
down
one
of
these
ferocious
animals
i
was
very
near
corporal
frost
when
an
immense
bull
came
charging
upon
us
a
hundred
yards
distant
frost
aimed
his
musket
a
flintlock
very
deliberately
and
only
fired
when
the
beast
was
within
six
paces
it
fell
headlong
almost
at
our
feet
d
tyler
adds
the
corporal
was
on
foot
while
of
course
the
colonel
and
staff
were
mounted
on
the
first
appearance
of
the
bull
the
colonel
with
his
usual
firm
manner
of
speech
ordered
the
corporal
to
load
his
gun
supposing
of
course
that
he
had
observed
the
previous
order
of
prohibition
to
this
command
he
the
corporal
paid
no
attention
thinking
him
either
stupified
or
dumbfounded
with
much
warmth
and
a
foul
epithet
he
next
ordered
him
to
run
but
this
mandate
was
as
little
heeded
as
the
other
doubtless
cooke
thought
one
man
with
some
stubborness
was
about
to
receive
a
terrible
retribution
but
when
he
saw
the
monster
lifeless
at
his
feet
through
the
aim
of
the
brave
and
fearless
corporal
how
changed
must
have
been
his
feelings
e
the
number
of
the
wild
bovine
enemy
killed
in
the
engagement
is
variously
reported
as
from
twenty
to
sixty
and
by
one
writer
as
high
as
opposition
at
leaving
the
san
pedro
the
command
marched
northeasterly
to
tucson
a
mexican
town
of
between
four
and
five
hundred
inhabitants
it
was
garrisoned
at
the
time
by
a
mexican
force
two
hundred
strong
according
to
cooke
commanded
by
captain
comaduran
who
was
under
order
from
the
governor
of
sonora
don
manuel
gandara
not
to
allow
an
armed
force
to
pass
through
the
town
without
resistance
the
guides
furnished
the
battalion
by
general
kearny
however
declared
it
was
for
the
command
either
to
march
through
tucson
or
make
a
detour
which
would
mean
a
hundred
miles
out
of
the
way
over
a
trackless
wilderness
and
mountains
cooke
determined
to
march
through
tucson
foster
the
interpreter
went
into
the
town
in
advance
and
was
put
under
guard
a
corporal
son
of
the
mexican
commander
with
three
mexican
soldiers
was
met
by
the
command
and
questioned
about
foster
and
on
admitting
that
he
was
under
guard
the
corporal
and
his
escort
were
immediately
placed
under
arrest
by
cooke
to
be
held
as
hostages
for
the
safety
of
the
interpreter
one
mexican
however
was
released
who
with
two
of
the
battalion
guides
carried
a
note
demanding
foster
release
this
was
complied
with
and
about
midnight
foster
was
brought
to
camp
attended
by
two
officers
authorized
to
make
a
special
armistice
cooke
proposed
that
the
mexican
command
deliver
up
a
few
arms
as
a
guarantee
of
surrender
and
a
token
that
the
inhabitants
of
tucson
would
not
fight
against
the
united
states
unless
they
were
exchanged
as
prisoners
of
war
the
mexican
prisoners
were
also
released
f
these
events
occurred
while
the
battalion
was
about
sixteen
miles
from
tucson
the
next
day
when
on
the
march
cooke
received
a
message
from
captain
comaduran
declining
the
proposition
to
surrender
the
battalion
were
ordered
to
load
their
guns
with
ball
before
reaching
the
town
however
another
message
was
received
saying
that
the
garrison
had
retreated
taking
two
brass
cannons
and
forcing
most
of
the
inhabitants
to
accompany
them
about
a
dozen
armed
mexicans
met
the
american
force
to
escort
them
into
the
town
before
passing
through
the
gates
the
commander
of
the
battalion
addressed
the
soldiers
saying
in
effect
that
the
garrison
and
citizens
had
fled
leaving
their
property
behind
but
they
had
not
come
to
make
war
upon
sonora
and
there
must
be
no
interference
with
the
private
property
of
the
citizens
g
the
battalion
marched
through
tucson
and
went
into
camp
about
half
a
mile
beyond
on
a
small
stream
before
leaving
the
vicinity
cooke
with
a
party
of
fifty
reconnoitered
the
country
above
the
town
towards
a
village
and
church
where
it
was
supposed
the
garrison
and
main
body
of
the
people
had
taken
refuge
as
the
nature
of
the
country
however
afforded
excellent
opportunities
for
ambush
if
the
mexicans
should
choose
to
make
resistance
the
company
of
fifty
returned
however
the
movement
was
not
without
its
value
since
according
to
cooke
and
as
was
afterwards
ascertained
it
caused
the
mexicans
who
had
fled
to
the
aforesaid
village
to
still
further
retreat
and
the
reinforcements
which
had
come
from
the
presidios
of
fronteras
santa
cruz
and
tubac
to
return
to
their
posts
h
with
kearny
renewing
its
journey
the
command
in
the
course
of
three
days
by
hard
marching
reached
the
gila
river
and
intersected
the
route
followed
by

kearny
four
hundred
and
miles

the
point
at
which
they

published
in
his

see

referring
to
it
in

southern
interests
prevailed
with
the
great
problem
of
the
practicability

location
of
a

railroad
under
investigation
had
the
map
of
this
wagon
route
before
them
with
its
continuance
to
the
west
and
perceived
that
it
gave
exactly
the
solution
of
its
unknown
element
that
a
southern
route
would
avoid
both
the
rocky
mountains
and

of
it
being
below

level
much
of
the
dreary

lay
through
stretches
of
sand

were
compelled
to
aid
the
teams
by
pulling
on
ropes
fifteen
to
twenty
men
to
a
wagon
no
water
was
to
be
had
but
by
the
digging
of
deep
wells
in
the
desert
sands
these
often
yielded
but
little
and
at
that
a
poor
quality
of
water
the
suffering
of
both

was

were
nearly
some
used
instead
of
shoes
rawhide
wrapped
around
their

improvised
a

an

of

it
was
on
approaching

that
the
rugged
heart
of

was

seemed
to
defy
aught
save
the

goat

description
over

with
crow
bar
and
pick
and
axe
in
hand
he
continues
the
battalion
worked
its
way
here
also
the
chasm
of
living
rock
more
narrow
than
their
wagons
was
encountered
through
which
they
hewed
a
passage
for
the
wagons
the
colonel
himself
taking
a
hand
in
the
hewing
i
came
to
the
canyon
says
the
colonel
and
found
it
much
worse
than
i
had
been
led
to
expect
by
the
report
of
the
guides
there
were
many
rocks
to
surmount
but
the
worst
was
the
narrow
pass
setting
the
example
myself
there
was
much
work
done
on
it
before
the
wagons
came
the
rock
was
hewn
with
axes
to
increase
the
opening
i
thought
it
wide
enough
and
going
on
found
a
hill
to
be
ascended
to
avoid
a
still
narrower
pass
a
great
rock
had
to
be
broken
before
it
could
be
crossed
but
when
a
trial
was
made
at
the
first
pass
it
was
found
too
narrow
by
a
foot
of
solid
rock
more
work
was
done
and
several
trials
made
the
sun
was
now
only
an
hour
high
and
it
was
about
seven
miles
to
the
first
water
i
had
a
wagon
taken
to
pieces
and
carried
through
meanwhile
we
still
hewed
and
hammered
at
the
mountain
side
but
the
best
road
tools
had
been
lost
the
next
wagon
body
was
lifted
through
and
then
the
running
gear
by
lifting
one
side
then
i
rode
on
again
and
saw
a
wagon
up
the
very
steep
hill
and
down
again
to
the
canyon
the
work
on
the
pass
was
perseveringly
continued
and
the
last
two
wagons
were
pulled
through
by
the
mules
with
loads
undisturbed
the
confused
information
respecting
the
state
of
hostilities
the
likelihood
of
meeting
retreating
bands
of
californians
en
route
for
the
mexican
state
of
sonora
led
the
colonel
to
renew
his
march
on
the
in
a
more
strictly
military
order
than
he
had
hitherto
followed
and
the

while
waiting
for
the
wagons
to
come
up
was
exercised
on
a
prairie
in
military
tactics
the
battalion
was
under
orders
to
march
to
san
diego
and
there
join
kearny
but
communication
with
that
officer
was
now
cut
off
writes
colonel
cooke
by
the
best
information
the
enemy
were
concentrated
at
los
angeles
the
general
was
marching
on
it
from
the
south
and
fremont
approaching
from
the
north
so
that
a
direct
march
on
los
angeles
from
the
east
was
evidently
the
proper
course
and
especially
so
as
captain
montgomery
from
san
diego
had
written
january
that
it
was
generally
believed
that
parties
of
californians
headed

an

that
the

the

the

about

the
next
day
the
deserted
catholic
mission

was
passed
one
mile
below
the
mission
writes
tyler
we
ascended
a
bluff
when
the
great
pacific
ocean
appeared
plain
to
our
view
only
about
three
miles
distant
the
joy
the
cheer
that
filled
our
souls
none
but
pilgrims
nearing
a
haven
of
rest
can
imagine
prior
to
leaving
nauvoo
we
had
talked
about
and
sung
of
great
pacific
sea
and
we
were
now
upon
its
very
borders
and
its
beauty
far
exceeded
our
most
sanguine
expectations
of
this
event
cooke
says
the
road
wound
through
smooth
green
valleys
and
over
very
lofty
hills
equally
smooth
and
green
from
the
top
of
one
of
these
hills
was
caught
the
first
and
a
magnificent
view
of
the
great
ocean
and
by
rare
chance
perhaps
it
was
so
calm
that
it
shone
as
a
mirror
further
describing
what
must
have
been

and

a
wonderful
scene
the
colonel
adds
the
charming
and
startling
effect
under
our
circumstances
of
this
first
view
of
the
ocean
could
not
be
expressed
but
in
an
old
diary
once
sunk
and
lost
in
a
river
i
find
what
follows
i
caught
my
first
sight
of
the
ocean
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
and
reflecting
the
full
blaze
of
the
declining
sun
from
these
sparkling
green
it
seemed
that
the
lower
world
had
turned
to
impalpable
dazzling
light
while
by
contrast
the
clear
sky
looked
dim
we
rode
on
into
a
valley
which
was
near
but
out
of
view
of
the
sea
its
smooth
sod
was
in
sunlight
and
shade
a
gentle
brook
wound
through
it
the
joyous
lark
the
gay
blackbird
the
musical
bluebird
even
the
household
wren
warbled
together
the
evening
song
it
seemed
a
sweet
domestic
scene
which
must
have
touched
the
hearts
of
my
rude
far
wanderers
but
coming
to
us
so
suddenly
there
was
a
marvelous
accompaniment
the
fitful
roar
of
tide
and
surf
upon
a
shore
while
now
and
then
some
great
troller
burst
upon
the
rocks
with
a
booming
thunder
it
was
not
a
discord
f
from
this
point
the
march
was
down
the
coast
for
the
most
part
in
sight
of
the
ocean
in
clear
bright
sunlight
the
battalion
no
longer
suffered
from
the
monotonous
hardships
of
the
deserts
and
cold
atmosphere
of
the
mountains
january
there
seemed
as
pleasant
as
may
in

history
may

half
of
it
has
been
through
a
wilderness
where
nothing
but
savages
and
wild
beasts
are
found
or
deserts
where
for
want
of
water
there
is
no
living
creature
there
with
almost
hopeless
labor
we
have
dug
deep
wells
which
the
future
traveler
will
enjoy
without
a
guide
who
had
traversed
them
we
have
ventured
into
trackless
tablelands
where
water
was
not
found
for
several
marches
with
crowbar
and
pick
and
axe
in
hand
we
worked
our
way
over
mountains
which
seemed
to
defy
aught
save
the
wild
goat
and
hewed
a
pass
through
a
chasm
of
living
rock
more
narrow
than
our
wagons
to
bring
these
first
wagons
to
the
pacific
we
have
preserved
the
strength
of
our
mules
by
herding
them
over
large
tracts
which
you
have
laboriously
guarded
without
loss
the
garrison
of
four
presidios
of
sonora
concentrated
within
the
walls
of
tucson
gave
us
no
pause
we
drove
them
out
with
their
artillery
but
our
intercourse
with
the
citizens
was
unmarked
by
a
single
act
of
injustice
thus
marching
half
naked
and
half
fed
and
living
upon
wild
animals
we
have
discovered
and
made
a
road
of
great
value
to
our
country
arrived
at

after
a

you
cheerfully
turned
off
from

to

of

to
enter

we

were
as
follows
san

on
the
evening
of

second

at
san

mission
an
order
was
issued
for
the
battalion
to
return
to
san
luis
rey
mission
to
garrison
that
station
this
mission
was
somewhat
midway
between
los
angeles
and
san
diego
and
it
was
doubtless
thought
that
the
battalion
by
being
stationed
there
could
keep
that
important
position
out
of
the
enemies
hands
should
mexican
hostilities
again
be
resumed
as
at
the
time
seemed
probable
and
they
would
also
be
available
there
for
quicker
movement
either
to
los
angeles
or
to
san
diego
should
danger
threaten
at
either
point
accordingly
on
february
the
return
march
was
begun
and
ended
about
noon
of
the
up
and
here
orders
were
given
for
a
general
clean
up
of
arms
and
clothes
such
as
they
had
shaving
cutting
hair
and
the
like
some
had
not
shaved
since
the
march
began
and
would
have
preferred
not
to
do
so
until
they
returned
to
their
people
says
the
historian
but
the
order
was
imperative
it
prescribed
that
no
beard
be
allowed
to
grow
below
the
tip
of
the
ear
hence
the
mustache
only
could
be
saved
the
hair
also
must
be
clipped
even
with
the
tip
of
the
ear
hence
the
long
and
tangled
locks
and
shocks
of
hair
of
a
year
growth
had
to
be
sacrificed
by
the
of
february
the
men
had
finished
cleaning
up
and
repairing
their
quarters
which
in
some
respects
even
then
were
not
the
most
pleasant
writes
tyler
as
we
were
with
fleas
as
well
as
the
more
filthy
vermin
and
no
person
however
cleanly
he
aimed
to
be
could
escape
from
them
on
the
of
february
according
to
tyler
colonel
cooke
and
lieutenant
stoneman
commenced
the
squad
drill
with
officers
which
continued
and
extended
to
companies
and
thence
to
the
battalion
and
lasted
altogether
for
twenty
days
when
the
battalion
was
supposed
to
have
learned
the
drill
and
all
the
officers
were
considered
capable
of
teaching
it
b
at

the
of

ordered
to

detached
from

directed
to

to
perform
garrison

at

apparently
for

a

an
attempt
of
the
mexicans
to
regain
possession
of

the
attempt
however

also
had
been

his
disobedience
he
was
deprived
of
his
commission
but
in
consideration
of
previous
service
it
was
offered
to

again

tyler

thought
as
their

not
definitely
settled
in

the

information
was
defective
we
had
better
for

mormon
commander
would
be
the
third
in
rank
among
the
officers
of
california
and
might
become
first
the
battalion
officers
quite
generally
favored
but
not
so
the
men
who
under
the
leadership
of
father
pettegrew
william
hyde
and
sergeant
tyler
were
in
favor
of
returning
to
their
families
and
the
body
of
their
people
the
result
of
the
effort
at
was
that
a
company
of
officers
and
men
for
six
months
and
performed
garrison
service
at
san
diego
the
rest
of
the

on
being
mustered
out
of
service
in
july
began
their
march
for
the
great
basin
of
the
rocky
mountains
going
via
sutter
fort
at
the
juncture
of
the
american
and
sacramento
rivers
from
san
francisco
about
miles
and
now
the
site
of
sacramento
capital
of
the
state
about
of
these
returning
volunteers
arrived
in
salt
lake
valley
on
the
first
of
october
the
reason
for
not
more
than
of
this
number
reaching
salt
lake
valley
that
fall
they
numbered
about
when
leaving
los
angeles
arose
from
the
following
circumstances
arriving
at
sutter
fort
and
finding
opportunity
for
employment
at
good
wages
a
number
desired
to
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity
and
accordingly
with
the
consent
and
approval
of
their
associates
a
few
remained
on
the
sixth
of
september
when
the
returning
volunteers
were
leaving
the
basin
of

tahoe
they
met
samuel

his
visit
to
brigham
young
whom
he
had
met
at
the
green
river
crossing
and
accompanied
to
salt
lake
valley
he
gave
the
battalion
members
a
doleful
account
of
the
region
where
the
mormon
people
were
settling
and
predicted
their
final
removal
to
california
he
urged
all
except
those
known
to
have
families
in
salt
lake
valley
to
return
to
california
and
work
until
spring
this
without
avail
the
next
day
however
the
volunteers
met
captain
james
brown
ranking
officer
of
the
pueblo
detachment
of
the
battalion
and
a
small
party
enroute
for
california
he
brought
with
him
letters
from
many
of
the
families
of
the
battalion
also
an
epistle
from
the
mormon
leaders
advising
those
who
had
no
means
of
subsistence
to
remain
in
california
and
labor
during
the
winter
and
make
their
way
to
salt
lake
valley
in
the
spring
bringing
their
earnings
with
them
about
of
the
volunteers
accepted
this
suggestion
and
returned
to
sutter
fort
where
they
found
employment
the
rest
of
the
company
continued
their
journey
to
salt
lake
valley
where
they
arrived
at
the
time

and
also
had
a
power
of

from
all
its

to
draw
their
pay
the
pueblo
detachment
had
drawn
its
pay
per
captain
brown
up
to
may
at
santa
fe
at
which
time
he
received
orders
to
resume
the
march
to
california
via
fort
laramie
the
detachment
arrived
in
salt
lake
valley
on
the
of
july
where
they
were
disbanded
since
the
term
of
their
enlistment
had
expired
on
the

on

up
to
that
date
according
to
the
rank
they
bore
upon
the

rolls
upon
which
the
battalion
had
been
mustered
out
of
the
service
purchase
of
ogden
site
with
battalion
sometime
early
in
the
goodyear
claim
to
a
tract
of
land
at
the
mouth
of
weber
canyon
said
to
be
twenty
miles
square
was
purchased
by
captain
james
brown
out
of
the
battalion
money
collected
by
him
and
by
the
advice
of
the
council
meaning
the
high
council
at
salt
lake
city
the
sum
paid
was
cash
down
in
this
statement
i
follow
the
journal
history
of
brigham
young
which
under
date
of
march
contains
a
letter
from
father
john
smith
president
of
the
salt
lake
high
council
giving
to
the
mormon
leader
absent
at
the
time
in
winter
quarters
the
above
information
c
the
goodyear
tract
is
specifically
described
as
commencing
at
the
mouth
of
weber
canyon
thence
following
the
wasatch
mountains
north
to
the
hot
springs
thence
westward
to
the
shores
of
the
salt
lake
along
the
shores
southward
to
a
point
opposite
weber
canyon
thence
eastward
to
the
point
of
beginning
d
goodyear
was
supposed
to
have
held
this
tract
of
land
on
which
ogden
city
now
stands
by
virtue
of
a
mexican
grant
this
however
it
was
subsequently
discovered
was
not
the
case
goodyear
title
amounted
to
no
more
than
a
squatter
claim
as
there
were
evidently
no
mexican
grants
of
land
in
the
eastern
and
northern
parts
of
the
territory
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
mexico
that
rested
upon
any
clearly
valid
evidence
of
title
from
mexico
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
subsequent
years
refused
to
recognize
the
mexican
grant
of
goodyear
and
held
that
title
inhered
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
alone
and
that
by
virtue
of
the
cession
of
the
territory
to
the
united
states
such
title
however
as
goodyear
claimed
was
purchased
as
above
related
and
by
battalion
money
and
while
the
title
of
goodyear
was
not
valid
the
purchase
his
title
such
as
it
was
and
gave
a
sense
of
security
to
the
colonists
who
first
settled
upon
one
of
the
most
desirable
tracts
of
land
in
the

of

brought
to

various
kinds
of
garden
and
fruit
seeds
as
well
as
grain
from
california
all
which
were
found
to
be
very
useful
in
the
new
colonies
where
both
variety
and
quantity
of

were
limited
lieutenant

which
proved
to
be

daniel

brought
the

pea
which
in
the
early
years
grew
so
prolific
as
the
field
pea
of

the
detached
members
of
the
battalion
who
wintered
at
pueblo
brought
with
them
to

battalion
part
in
the
discovery
of
gold
in
as
already
stated
a
number
of
the
mormon
battalion
members
found
employment
at
sutter
fort
with
john
sutter
himself
in
fact
who
was
a
rather
enterprising
swiss
one
who
had
houses
and
land
flocks
and
herds
mills
and
machinery
he
counted
his
skilled
artisans
by
the
score
says
the
account
i
am
following
and
his
savage
retainers
by
the
hundred
he
was
moreover
a
man
of
progress
among
his
pressing
needs
and
the
needs
of
the
country
at
large
was
a
saw
mill
the
flour
mills
he
then
had
in
course
of
construction
needed
timbers
and
there
would
be
large
profit
in
shipping
lumber
to
san
francisco
accordingly
his
foreman
a
james
marshall
a
native
of
new
jersey
and
then
about
years
of
age
and
a
carpenter
took
in
hand
the
task
of
building
a
saw
mill
after
considerable
exploration
the
requisite
combination
of
water
power
timber
and
the
possibility
of
easy
access
to
the
fort
was
found
in
the
coloma
valley
on
the
south
fork
of
the
american
river
and
about
miles
due
east
of
the
fort
in
the
latter
part
of
august
or
the
first
of
september
marshall
with
a
party
of
about
a
dozen
white
men
nine
of
whom
were
discharged
members
of
the
mormon
battalion
e
and
about
as
many
indians
went
to
coloma
valley
and
began
the
construction
of
the
proposed
mill
a
brush
dam
was
built
in
the
river
and
a
mill
race
constructed
along
a
dry
channel
to
economize
labor
the
largest
stones
were
thrown
out
of
this
and
during
the
night
the
water
would
be
turned
in
to
carry
off
the
dirt
and
sand
on
the
of
january
while
sauntering
along
the
tail
race
inspecting
the
work
marshall
noticed
yellow
particles
mingled
with
the
excavated
earth
which
had
been
washed
by
late
rains
sending
an
indian
to
his
cabin
for
a
tin
plate
marshall
washed
out
some
of
the
soil
and
obtained
a
small
quantity
of
yellow
metal
during
the
evening
he
remarked
to
his
associates
of
the
camp
that
he
believed
he
had
found
gold
which
was
received
with
some
doubts
the
expressions
being
i
reckon
not
and
no
such
luck
but
henry
bigler
one
of
the
battalion
members
made
the
following
entry
in
his
journal
that
day
monday
january
this
day
some
kind
of
metal
was
found
in
the
tail
race
that
looks
like
gold
clear
and
has
been
all
the
last
week
our
metal
has
been
tried
and
proves
to
be
gold
it
is
thought
to
be
rich
we
have
picked
up
more
than
a
hundred
dollars
worth
this
week
date
of
the
discovery
of
thus
it
is
the
journal
of
a
member
of
the
mormon
battalion
which
determines
the
date
of
the
event
which
startled
the
world
usually
the
of
january
is
given
as
the
date
but
in
his
history
of
california
bancroft
discusses
the
subject
as
follows
the
of
january
is
the
date
usually
given
but
i
am
satisfied
it
is
incorrect
there
are
but
two
authorities
to
choose
between
marshall
the
discoverer
and
one
henry
bigler
a
mormon
engaged
upon
the
work
at
the
time
besides
confusion
of
mind
in
other
respects
marshall
admits
that
he
does
not
know
the
date
on
or
about
the
of
january
he
says
hutchings
magazine
ii
i
am
not
quite
certain
to
a
day
but
it
was
between
the
and
whereupon
the
has
been
generally
accepted
bigler
on
the
other
hand
was
a
cool
methodical
man
moreover
he
kept
a
journal
in
which
he
entered
occurrences
on
the
spot
and
it
is
from
this
journal
i
get
my
date
if
further
evidence
be
wanting
we
have
it
marshall
states
that
four
days
after
the
discovery
he
proceeded
to
new
helvetta
identical
as
to
the
location
with
sutter
fort
with
specimens
now
by
reference
to
another
journal
new
helvetta
diary
we
find
that
marshall
arrived
at
the
fort
on
the
evening
of
the
if
we
reckon
the
day
of
discovery
as
one
of
the
four
days
allow
marshall
one
night
on
the
way
which
parsons
gives
him
and
count
the
one
day
we
have
the

date
of
discovery

proved

tide
of
western
civilization
the
discovery
of
gold
is
the
historical
event
that
turned
the
eyes
of
the
civilized
world
to
california
within
a
year
it
started
that
mighty
wave
of
western
emigration
from
all
parts
of
the
united
states
many
parts
of
europe
and
even
from
asia
it
was
to
be
a
subject
of
the
president
message
to
congress
before
the
close
of
the
year
within
two
years
it
would
make
california
one
of
the
sovereign
states
of
the
american
union
with
a
population
of
nearly
one
hundred
thousand
in
seven
years
it
would
result
in
adding
nearly
five
hundred
million
dollars
to
the
store
of
gold
and
then
as
the
gold
from
soil
and
sand
was
exhausted
and
costly
operations
upon
quartz
ledges
and
delving
into
the
earth
were
required
to
secure
the
precious
metal
many
men
who
had
come
to
the
mines
turned
their
attention
to
agriculture
and
to
horticulture
and
found
in
the
grain
fields
vineyards
and
orchards
of
the
pacific
slope
even
a
greater
source
of
wealth
than
in
the
gold
mines
for
a
time
an
effort
was
made
to
keep
the
discovery
of
gold
quiet
but
gradually
it
became
known
and
the
secret
of
the
sierras
was
revealed
to
the
world
with
the
result
already
noted
san
francisco
however
was
indifferent
for
some
time
the
final
conversion
of
that
town
to
the
discovery
of
gold
did
not
take
place
until
samuel
brannan
the
leader
of
the
brooklyn
colony
of
mormons
to
california
came
down
from
fort
where
he
had
a
store
to
san
francisco
in
company
with
a
number
of
others
who
had
with
them
specimens
of
collected
gold
in
both
dust
and
nuggets
brannan
holding
in
one
hand
a
bottle
of
yellow
dust
and
with
the
other
swinging
his
hat
rushed
down
the
street
shouting
gold
gold
gold
from
the
american
river
this
in
may
and
soon
afterwards
san
francisco
was
deserted
for
the
mormon
battalion
diggings
on
the
american
the
spare
time
of
the
mormons
at
sutter
was
devoted
to
washing
out
gold
in
the
millrace
and
from
the
deposits
of
the
sand
bars
along
the
river
henry
bigler
on
the
of
february
wrote
to
members
of
the
battalion
at
sutter
fort
telling
them
of
the
discovery
of
gold
but
cautioned
them
to
impart
the
information
only
to
those
who
could
be
relied
upon
to
keep
the
secret
they
entrusted
it
to
three
other
members
of
the
battalion
six
days
later
three
of
the
number
sidney
willis
levi
fifield
and
wilford
hudson
came
up
to
the
and
frankly
told
sutter
they
had
come
to
search
for
gold
and
he
gave
them
permission
to
mine
in
the
tail
of
the
millrace
the
next
day
they
began
work
and
were
fairly
successful
hudson
picked
out
one
piece
of
gold
worth
six
dollars
after
a
few
days
however
these
men
felt
under
obligations
to
return
to
the
fort
as
they
had
given
it
out
that
they
were
merely
going
to
the
on
a
visit
and
a
few
days
shooting
returning
willis
and
hudson
followed
down
the
stream
for
the
purpose
of
prospecting
fifield
accompanied
by
bigler
followed
the
wagon
road
about
half
way
between
the
and
the
fort
hudson
and
willis
on
a
bar
opposite
a
little
island
in
the
river
found
a
small
quantity
of
gold
not
more
than
half
a
dollar
in
value
and
while
the
smallness
of
the
find
filled
the
two
prospectors
with
disgust
the
other
battalion
members
at
the
fort
insisted
upon
being
taken
to
the
point
where
the
gold
had
been
found
that
together
they
might
examine
the
place
it
was
with
difficulty
that
they
prevailed
upon
them
to
do
so
remarks
bancroft
but
finally
willis
and
hudson
consented
and
the
so
lately
slighted
spot
continues
the
historian
of
california
presently
became
famous
as
the
rich
diggins
the
island
island
taking
its
name
from
these
battalion
boys
who
had
first
found
gold
there
but
notwithstanding
this
new
discovery
by
these
members
of
the
battalion
and
notwithstanding
their
development
of
the
discovery
of
marshall
and
the
huge
excitement
which
followed
and
the
fact
that
whenever
they
could
get
released
a
day
from
their
duty
to
their
employer
they
could
usually
obtain
in
gold
several
times
over
their
day
wages
history
has
to
record
that
they
were
true
to
their
engagement
to
sutter
they
had
promised
sutter
says
bancroft
to
stand
by
him
and
finish
the
saw
mill
this
they
did
starting
it
running
on
the
of
march
henry
bigler
was
still
there
on
the
of
april
bigler
stephens
and
brown
presented
themselves
at
the
fort
to
settle
accounts
with
sutter
call
of
the
call
of
duty
was
also
pressing
upon
these
battalion
men
from
another
direction
the
instructions
from
the
mormon
leaders
to
the
members
of
the
battalion
as
we
have
seen
was
that
they
should
remain
in
california
during
the
winter
but
make
their
way
to
the
salt
lake
valley
in
the
spring
bringing
their
earnings
with
them
hence
when
settling
with
sutter
on
the
of
april
the
preliminaries
were
arranged
for
this
prospective
journey
to
the
great
basin
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
first
of
june
was
fixed
upon
as
the
time
of
their
departure
notice
was
given
to
sutter
accordingly
so
that
by
that
time
he
could
replace
the
mormon
workmen
in
his
employ
by
others
horses
cattle
and
the
seeds
they
intended
taking
with
them
were
to
be
bought
of
him
also
two
brass
cannons
to
be
a
defense
against
possible
indian
attacks
enroute
and
for

at
first
a
company
of
eight
went
into
the
mountains
to
explore
a
route
but
found
the
snow
too
deep
for
passage
at
that
time
the
constantly
growing
gold
excitement
also
in
consequence
of
its
general
unsettling
of
things
delayed
their
departure
a
month
beyond
the
time
fixed
upon
for
starting
meantime
many
of
the
battalion
members
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
search
for
gold
bigler
and
two
others
of
the
battalion
followed
up
the
american
river
from
the
fort
about
fifteen
miles
finding
gold
as
they
went
arriving
at
mormon
island
they
came
upon
the
seven
members
of
the
battalion
mining
there
who
that
day
had
taken
out
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
bigler
and
his
associates
mined
for
two
months
about
one
mile
below
the
dividing
with
sutter
and
marshall
who
furnished
tools
and
provisions
the
land
owners
demanded
the
product
for
a
time
this
was
finally
reduced
to
in
the
midst
of
this
prosperous
mining
activity
and
the
daily
growing
gold
fever
the
mad
rush
from
san
francisco
and
other
parts
of
california
the
members
of
the
battalion
sought
out
a
rendezvous
for
their
gathering
preparatory
to
the
journey
across
the
mountains
the
place
of
rendezvous
was
called
by
them
pleasant

near
the
present
site
of
placerville
a
short
distance
up
the
south
fork
of
the
american
river
and
not
far
from
the
place
where
gold
was
first
discovered
on
that
stream
parties
came
in
one
after
another
until
the
of
july
when
about
men
and
one
woman
the
wife
of
one
of
the
party
had
assembled
bringing
with
them
wagons
horses
cattle
and
other
effects
on
the
a
start
was
made
as
the
wagons
rolled
up
along

writes
bancroft
their

thundered

thus
as
further
remarked
by
the
author
here
followed
amidst
the
scenes
now
every
day
becoming
more
and
more
absorbing
bringing
to
the
front
the
strongest
passions
in
man
nature
at
the
call
of
what
they
deemed
duty
these
devotees
of
their
religion
unhesitatingly
laid
down
their
implements
turned
their
back
on
what
all
the
world
was
just
then
making
ready
with
hot
haste
and
mustered
strength
to
grasp
at
and
struggle
for
and
marched
through
new
toils
and
dangers
to
meet
their
exiled
brethren
in
the
desert
the
fame
of
having
discovered
gold
may
not
be
claimed
for
members
of
the
mormon
battalion
that
belongs
to
marshall
unquestionably
though
the
mormons
in
camp
when
it
was
found
of
white
men
were
in
the
majority
and
the
shovels
in
their
industrious
hands
it
was
which
threw
up
the
soil
and
they
were
the
first
to
extend
the
discovery
and
theirs
the
honors
to
first
chronicle
the
date
and
fact
of
the
event
that
was
to
mean
so
much
to
the
pacific
coast
of
america
and
to
the
world
but
while
the
honor
of
making
the
mere
discovery
of
gold
may
not
be
claimed
for
them
that
which
is
infinitely
better
may
be
claimed
for
them
the
honor
of
writing
into
the
annals
of
california
and
of
the
world
history
this
fine
example
of
fidelity
to
duty
detailed
above
and
which
is
not
in
any
of
the
records
written
by
men
of
the
sierras
from
the
western
it
was
a
difficult
task
to
cut
a
wagon
road
from
the
west
side
through
the
lofty
sierras
that
faced
them
a
task
of
infinite
toil
and
in
the
presence
of
great
danger
from
the
lurking
savages
three
pioneers
who
had
insisted
upon
going
in
advance
to
blaze
the
route
for
the
main
company

been
murdered
by
the
indians
these
pioneers
were
named

ezra
allen
and
henderson
cox
the
main
camp
came
upon
their
mutilated
bodies
at
a
spring
which
because
of
this
event
still
bears
the
name
tragedy
spring
what
numbers
of
these
savages
the
main
company
would
encounter
what
their
mood
would
be
murderous
or
friendly
of
course
could
not
be
conjectured
it
was
of
the
dangers
they
must
risk
by
almost
incredible
toil
and
patience
however
this
company
of
mormon
battalion
men
conquered
the
ascent
of
the
sierras
from
the
western
side
hewing
a
roadway
for
their
seventeen
wagons
through
stony
heights
and
in
like
manner
down
steep
declivities
and
narrow
gorges
until
the
eastern
sloping
deserts
beyond
were
reached
and
finally
the
valley
of
the
great
salt
lake
about
the
first
of
october
to
them
for
the
time
the
place
to
which
duty
had
called
them
trail
from
los
angeles
to
salt
the
company
that
at
los
angeles
for
six
months
beyond
the
battalion
original
term
of
enlistment
served
eight
months
and
then
were
mustered
out
of
the
service
some
of
these
on
being
disbanded
went
by
way
of
the
coast
to
the
mines
or
engaged
in
other
industries
in
california
for
a
time
but
most
of
them
finally
made
their
way
to
salt
lake
valley
in
the
course
of
one
or
two
years
though
a
few
remained
permanently
in
california
a
squad
of
from
this
company
however
on
being
mustered
out
of
the
service
organized
at
once
for
the
journey
to
salt
lake
valley
taking
with
them
one
wagon
and
a
band
of
one
hundred
and
mules
they
went
by
way
of
what
was
called
the
southern
route
hitherto
however
traveled
only
by
packers
and
the
wagon
of
this
battalion
company
was
the
first
to
make
the
journey
over
the
pack
trail
this
company
reached
salt
lake
valley
on
the
of
june
of
appreciation
of
the
battalion
the
best
evidence
that
the
service
of
the
mormon
battalion
was
honorable
and
appreciated
by
both
the
people
of
california
and
the
government
exists
in
the
fact
of
the
efforts
that
were
made
on
the
part
of
both
the
people
and
the
government
to
prolong
their
service
some
of
which
efforts
have
already
been
noted
in
these
pages
as
the
time
approached
for
the
company
that
had
to
be
mustered
out
of
service
known
as
the
company
of
mormon
volunteers
the
people
of
san
diego
drafted
a
petition
begging
the
governor
to
use
his
influence
to
keep
the
company
in
the
service
the
petition
was
signed
by
every
citizen
in
the
town
and
governor
mason
tried
hard
to
induce
the
company
to
remain
in
the
service
another
year
failing
in
that
then
to
stay
six
months
longer
all
to
no
purpose
however
the
volunteers
were
determined
to
join
their
friends
and
families
in
salt
lake
valley
and
made
the
journey
as
stated
above
to
raise
a
second
mormon
when
the
battalion
proper
was
mustered
out
of
service
in
july
efforts
were
set
on
foot
at
that
time
to
raise
a
second
mormon
battalion
of
which
captain
jefferson
hunt
was
to
be
given
the
command
with
the
office
of
the
office
held
by
its
first
commander
allen
and
later
by
cooke
it
is
learned
from
a
report
made
by
governor
mason
that
the
war
department
and
hence
the
national
administration
also
sought
the
enlistment
of
this
second
battalion
in
his
report
to
the
adjutant
general
of
september
governor
mason
says
of
the
service
of
this
battalion
of
their
patience
subordination
and
general
good
conduct
you
have
already
heard
and
i
take
great
pleasure
in
adding
that
as
a
body
of
men
they
have
religiously
respected
the
rights
and
feelings
of
these
conquered
people
and
not
a
syllable
of
complaint
has
reached
my
ears
of
a
single
insult
offered
or
outrage
done
by
a
mormon
volunteer
so
high
an
opinion
did
i
entertain
of
the
battalion
and
of
their
special
fitness
for
the
duties
now
performed
by
the
garrisons
in
this
country
that
i
made
strenuous
efforts
to
engage
their
service
for
another
year
f
the
month
following
after
governor
mason
had
met
captain
brown
of
the
pueblo
detachment
and
received
his
report
and
paid
off
that
division
of
the
command
also
after
captain
hunt
who
had
been
for
some
time
acting
as
indian
agent
at
luis
del

was
well
on

of

a
copy
of
which
you
will
find
among
the

department
in

letter
i
offered
captain
hunt
the
command
of
the
battalion
with
the
rank
of
with
an
adjutant
but
i
find
by
the
orders
lately
received
that
a
battalion
of
four
companies
is
only
entitled
to
a
major

acting

will
notify
captain

change
at

early
a
moment
as
i
can
communicate
with
him
i
am
pleased
to
find

despatches
that
in
this
matter
i
have
anticipated
the
wish
of
the
department

when
however
the
subject
of
raising
a
second
battalion
was
presented
to
brigham
young
both
through
jonathan
stevenson
of
the
new
york
regiment
of
volunteers
prompted
by
governor
mason
also
through
captain
hunt
in
person
the
proposition
was
declined
regarding
the
first
enlistment
from
the
standpoint
alone
of
the
sacrifices
it
involved
president
young
saw
no
occasion
to
make
like
sacrifices
a

and
no

was
made

the
battalion
in
the
perspective
of
years
the
story
of
the
mormon
battalion
is
now
before
the
reader
the
perspective
of
years
corrects
many
of
the
misapprehensions
that
once
obtained
respecting
the
purpose
of
its
being
called
and
its
mission
and
as
this
perspective
corrects
the
misconceptions
of
the
past
so
also
does
it
enable
us
to
recognize
the
real
importance
and
value
of
the
incident
and
the
greatness
of
the
achievements
of
this
battalion
of
the
united
states
troops
for
such
they
were
and
the
matter
of
their
coming
from
the
westward
migrating
camps
of
the
mormon
people
should
not
be
allowed
to
obscure
that
fact
battalion
as
utah
also
it
should
be
always
held
in
mind
that
the
members
of
the
battalion
were
among
the
pioneers
and
founders
of
the
state
of
utah
for
though
the
main
body
of
the
battalion
went
to
california
its
members
were
never
for
a
day
separated
in
thought
or
purpose
from
the
main
body
of
their
people
whom
they
had
assisted
in
their
pilgrimage
by
the
means
sent
to
them
from
their
pay
both
from
fort
leavenworth
and
from
santa
fe
the
seeds
and
the
tents
and
arms
equipment
they
brought
with
them
when
returning
from
their
historic
march
and
the
newly
mined
gold
for
currency
all
of
which
was
so
helpful
in
founding
the
commonwealth
to
be
to
say
nothing
of
the
advantage
their
service
in
the
army
of
the
west
had
been
to
their
people
in
securing
the
effective
element
in
the
plea
for
their
right
to
occupy
indian
lands
along
the
missouri
river
in
iowa
and

besides
one

fifty
of
their
number

and
other

so
closely
upon
the
heels
of
the
first
company
of
pioneers
led
by
brigham
young
that
they
arrived
in
the
salt

only
five
days
after

these
were
the

the

in

the
adoption
of
irrigation
farming
by
an
people

of
these
movements
the
battalion
was
an
important
factor
the
part
the
battalion
took
in
opening
the
highways
to
the
pacific
has
already
been
detailed
in
the
story
of
their
march
and
fully
recognized
in
the

order
already
quoted
in

and
which
is
now
on

as
a
government
document
in

added
to
the
united
states
by
the
conquest
of
in
all
says
a
reliable
authority
more
than
five
hundred
and
ninety
thousand
square
miles
were
added
to
the
territory
of
the
united

as
a
result
of

this
included
the

half
of

the
west
half
of

had
the
map
of
this
wagon
route
before
them
with
its
continuance
to
the
west
and
perceived
that
it
gave
exactly
the
solution
of
its
unknown
element
that
a
southern
route
would
avoid
both
the
rocky
mountains
and
sierra
nevadas
with
their
snows
and
would
meet
no
obstacle

several
times
and
given
in

in

of
this

in
addition
to
all
this
the
battalion
reflected
great
credit
upon
the
community
of
utah
pioneers
of
whom
it
never
ceased
to
be
a
part
by
reason
of
the
excellence
of
their
conduct
not
only
on
the
march
to
the
pacific
coast
but
also
when
doing
garrison
duty
in
southern
california
the
efforts
to
secure
the
of
the
battalion
and
failing
that
the
effort
to
secure
the
enlistment
of
a
second
mormon
battalion
were
the
conscious
confessions
of
both
california
and
federal
officials
since
both
participated
in
such
efforts
to
the
worth
of
these
united
states
soldiers
they
religiously
respected
their
rights
and
feelings
of
the
conquered
people
of
california
not
a
syllable
of
complaint
of
a
single
insult
offered
or
any
outrage
done
by
a
mormon
volunteer
is
the
record
of
the
battalion
and
the
volunteers
according
to
the
report
of
them
by
governor
mason
such
is
the
reputation
of
the
battalion
of
its
officers
chosen
from
its
ranks
and
of
its
men
the
rank
and
file
the
part
the
battalion
played
in
the
discovery
of
gold
has
already
been
detailed
with
the
connection
of
members
of
the
battalion
with
the
introduction
of
irrigation
among
an
people
and
most
likely
coming
from
their
suggestion
is
a
deduction
from
circumstances
rather
than
a
fact
sustained
by
direct
and
positive
proof
when
brigham
young
company
of
pioneers
were
about
to
leave
green
river
on
july
they
were
overtaken
by
a
detachment
of
thirteen
men
from
the
battalion
who
were
in
pursuit
of
men
who
had
stolen
horses
from
their
camps
some
seven
days
travel
eastward
these
men
had
been
with
the
several
invalided
detachments
from
the
battalion
about
in
all
that
had
wintered
at
pueblo
in
what
is
now
the
state
of
colorado
they
were
incorporated
into
the
pioneer
company
and
came
on
with
it
to
salt
lake
valley
and
undoubtedly
members
of
this
group
would
be
upon
the
ground
that
day
of
july
when
ploughing
was
first
attempted
on
the
south
fork
of
city
creek
on
the
present
site
of
great
salt
lake
city
the
annals
of
that
day
say
that
the
ground
was
so
dry
and
hard
that
in
the
attempt
to
plow
it
several
plows
were
broken
whereupon
at
someone
suggestion
who
it
was
that
made
it
the
annals
do
not
disclose
and
it
is
not
known
a
company
was
set
at
work
to
put
in
a
dam
in
the
creek
and
flood
the
land
in
order
to
plow
it
this
was
the
beginning
of
irrigation
as
already
stated
who
it
was
that
made
the
fortunate
suggestion
that
the
water
be
turned
out
upon
the
land
in
order
to
make
it
possible
to
plow
it
is
not
known
but
we
have
seen
that
thirteen
members
of
the
battalion
were
among
the
pioneers
and
some
of
them
had
seen
irrigation
in
operation
among
the
mexicans
at
santa
fe
and
further
south
in
the
valley
of
the
rio
grande
what
more
likely
than
that
some
of
those
men
who
had
seen
irrigation
in
progress
should
suggest
the
flooding
of
the
land
to
prepare
it
for
plowing
as
they
had
seen
it
conducted
over
the
land
to
convey
moisture
to
the
growing
vegetation
the
probability
of
it
has
moral
certainty

natural

was

a

anecdotes

fortunately
survived

which
were
related
by
wilford
woodruff
at
the
celebration
of

day
in
show
the
colonel
in
some
of
his
better
moods
and
witness
the
fact
that
he
could
be
somewhat
broadly
tolerant
of
the
independent
attitude
of
some
members
of
his
mormon
command
the
woodruff
narratives
follow
of
those
who
marched
with
him
colonel
cooke
can
understand
him
much
better
than
i
can
describe
him
i
think
he
possessed
a
better
heart
than
his
language
would
sometimes
indicate
he
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
like
lord
nelson
expected
every
man
to
do
his
duty
but
he
had
a
peculiar
streak
in
his
composition
at
times
that
induced
him
to
see
how
far
the
mormon
battalion
would
go
in
obeying
his
commands
and
that
were
inconsistent
with
reason
and
good
judgment
as
an
illustration
of
this
for
the
edification
or
amusement
of
the
remnant
of
the
battalion
who
are
present
i
will
refer
to
a
few
incidents
and
if
i
do
not
get
everything
as
it
transpired
i
will
get
it
as
nearly
as
i
can
from
the
report
of
those
who
were
present
cooke
and
christopher
on
one
occasion
while
the
battalion
was
crossing
a
river
with
a
cooke
was
sitting
on
his
mule
on
the
bank
looking
at
them
the
boat
went
down
into
such
deep
water
that
the
setting
poles
did
not
touch
bottom
the
upper
side
said
he
they
did
so
but
could
not
touch
bottom
the
colonel
then
took
off
his
hat
and
said
bye
gentlemen
when
you
get
down
to
the
gulf
of
california
give
my
respects
to
the
folks
he
then
rode
off
and
left
them
not
waiting
to
see
whether
they
would
reach
shore
or
go
down
the
river
he
soon
returned
and
found
that
they
had
got
ashore
while
sitting
there
christopher
layton
rode
up
to
the
river
on
a
mule
to
let
it
drink
cooke
said
to
him
man
i
want
you
to
ride
across
the
river
and
carry
a
message
for
me
to
capt
hunt
it
being
natural
for
the
men
to
obey
the
colonel
order
he
layton
tried
to
ride
into
the
river
but
he
had
gone
but
a
few
steps
before
his
mule
was
going
in
all
over
so
brother
layton
stopped
the
colonel
halloed
out
on
young
man
go
on
young
man
but
brother
layton
on
a
reflection
was
satisfied
that
if
he
attempted
it
both
he
and
his
mule
would
stand
a
good
chance
to
be
drowned
the
colonel
himself
was
satisfied
of
the
same
so
brother
layton
turned
his
mule
and
rode
off
saying
as
he
came
out
i
see
you
in
hell
before
i
will
drown
myself
and
mule
in
that
river
the
colonel
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
said
to
the
is
that
man
name
layton
sir
he
is
a
saucy
fellow
cooke
and
lot
on
another
occasion
while
the
battalion
was
at
santa
fe
cooke
ordered
lot
smith
to
guard
a
mexican
corral
and
having
a
company
of
united
states
cavalry
camped
by
he
told
lot
if
the
men
came
to
steal
the
poles
to
bayonet
them
the
men
came
and
surrounded
the
corral
and
while
lot
was
guarding
one
side
they
would
hitch
to
a
pole
on
the
other
and
ride
off
with
it
when
the
colonel
saw
the
poles
were
gone
he
asked
lot
why
he
did
not
obey
orders
and
bayonet
the
thieves
lot
replied
if
you
expect
me
to
bayonet
united
states
troops
for
taking
a
pole
on
the
enemy
ground
to
make
a
fire
of
you
mistake
your
man
lot
expected
to
be
punished
and
he
was
placed
under
guard
but
nothing
further
was
done
about
it
colonel
the
mule
and
cooke
called
upon
bigler
as
a
provost
guard
one
day
to
guard
his
tent
the
colonel
had
a
favorite
mule
which
was
fed
some
grain
on
a
blanket
one
of
the
freight
mules
came
up
and
helped
to
eat
the
grain
the
colonel
drove
him
off
several
times
but
he
would
follow
him
again
until
the
colonel
got
vexed
and
said
to
bigler
your
musket
loaded
sir
load
it
and
give
it
to
me
brother
bigler
is
the
last
man
on
earth
that
any
one
acquainted
with
him
would
have
supposed
would
have
played
any
tricks
on
the
colonel
but
he
took
out
a
cartridge
and
bit
off
the
ball
end
which
he
dropped
on
the
ground
he
then
rammed
the
powder
and
paper
down
the
gun
capped
it
and
handed
it
to
the
colonel
several
of
the
officers
of
the
battalion
stood
looking
on
as
the
mule
came
back
to
get
the
grain
and
had
arrived
within
a
rod
of
him
the
colonel
fired
the
charge
into
its
face
but
the
only
effect
that
it
had
upon
the
mule
was
to
cause
it
to
give
a
snort
wheel
around
and
kick
at
him
and
then
run
off
a
few
rods
after
which
it
turned
to
come
back
again
this
created
a
good
deal
of
amusement
with
the
lookers
on
the
only
remark
the
colonel
made
as
he
handed
back
the
musket
to
brother
bigler
was
man
that
gun
was
not
properly
loaded
wire
damn
you
cooke
had
rather
more
sternness
than
familiarity
in
him
when
he
gave
an
order
if
he
was
not
fully
understood
by
the
soldiers
they
did
not
like
to
question
him
on
one
occasion
he
wanted
some
wire
to
fix
up
his
tent
he
ordered
one
of
the
soldiers
to
go
to
a
certain
man
and
get
some
wire
but
he
did
not
speak
plainly
and
the
soldier
did
not
understand
what
he
said
nevertheless
the
soldier
started
to
go
on
the
errand
but
began
to
think
that
he
could
not
tell
what
to
ask
for
so
he
went
back
to
the
colonel
and
asked
him
what
he
had
told
him
to
get
the
colonel
said
wire
wire
damn
you
sir
the
soldier
went
to
the
man
and
asked
for
some
wire
for
cooke
but
the
man
had
not
got
any
wire
did
you
ask
for
inquired
the
colonel
when
the
man
returned
asked
for
wire
wire
wire
damn
you
sir
will
do
that
will
do
young
man
you
may
go
to
your
tent
cooke
respect
for
the
these
instances
show
a
little
of
the
kind
of
temperament
cooke
possessed
but
he
had
a
good
generous
heart
he
entertained
great
respect
for
the
mormon
battalion
and
he
always
spoke
kindly
of
them
before
the
government
and
all
men
when
he
went
through
salt
lake
city
with
johnston
in
he
uncovered
his
head
in
honor
of
the
mormon
battalion
that
five
hundred
brave
men
that
he
had
led
two
thousand
miles
over
sandy
deserts
and
through
rocky
canyons
in
the
midst
of
thirst
hunger
and
fatigue
in
the
service
of

mormon
battalion
commission
may
well
be
taken
for
a
description
of
the
mormon
battalion
monument
that
it
is
proposed
to
erect
on
the
capitol
grounds
to
the
chairman
of
members
of
the
mormon
battalion
monument
commission
as
a
member
of
your
subcommittee
delegated
to
go
to
chicago
to
inspect
the
model
of
the
proposed
mormon
battalion
monument
i
have
the
honor
to
report
the
base
is
in
triangular
form
with
concave
sides
and
rounded
corners
a
bronze
figure
of
a
battalion
man
is
mounted
upon
the
front
corner
flanking
him
on
two
sides
of
the
triangle
are
cut
in
high
relief
on
the
left
the
scene
of
the
enlistment
of
the
battalion
under
the
flag
of
the
united
states
of
america
on
the
right
a
scene
of
the
march
where
the
men
are
assisting
in
pulling
the
wagons
of
their
train
up
and
over
a
precipitous
ascent
while
still
others
are
ahead
widening
a
cut
to
permit
the
passage
of
the
wagons
between
the
rocks
the
background
is
a
representation
of
mountains
of
the
character
through
which
the
battalion
and
its
train
passed
on
the
journey
to
the
pacific
just
below
the
peak
in
the
center
and
in
front
of
it
is
chiseled
a
beautiful
head
and
upper
part
of
a
woman
symbolizing
the
of
the
west
she
personifies
the
impulsive
power
and
motive
force
that
sustained
these
battalion
men
and
led
them
as
a
vanguard
of
civilization
across
the
trackless
plains
and
through
the
difficult
defiles
and
passes
of
the
mountains
the
idea
of
the
sculptor
in
the
of
the
west
is
a
magnificent
conception
and
should
dominate
the
whole
monument
the
bronze
figure
of
the
battalion
man
is
dignified
strong
and
reverential
he
excellently
typifies
that
band
of
pioneer
soldiers
which
broke
away
through
the
rugged
mountains
and
over
trackless
wastes
hovering
over
and
above
him
the
beautiful
female
figure
with
an
air
of
solicitous
care
guards
him
in
his
reverie
her
face
stands
out
in
full
relief
the
hair
and
diaphanous
drapery
waft
back
mingling
with
the
clouds
while
the
figure
fades
into
dim
outline
in
the
massive
peaks
and
mountains
seeming
to
pervade
the
air
and
the
soil
with
her
very
soul
spirit
of
the
west
is
but
one
of
the
many
attributes
of
deity
symbolizing
that
infinite
love
and
care
which
the
deity
has
for
all
his
children
and
it
represents
the
hope
courage
and
determination
which
moved
and
impelled
the
battalion
man
his
comrades
and
all
the
others
who
have
followed
in
their
footsteps
in
the
settlement
and
development
of
the
great
west
it
is
the
spirit
back
of
the
breaking
of
the
soil
by
the
farmer
back
of
the
institution
of
our
schools
back
of
our
mines
back
of
our
government
and
of
our
very
hearthsides
it
permeates
the
air
the
soil
and
the
hearts
of
men
it
tempers
the
character
of
all
who
come
within
the
influence
of
the
boundless
plains
and
majestic
peaks
it
has
led
men
to
make
a
garden
of
a
desert
and
a
treasure
house
of
the
mountain
it
has
justified
and
approved
every
sacrifice
to
make
this
part
of
the
world
a
better
place
in
which
to
live
it
is
constant
never
ending
infinite
it
is
pleasant
to
contemplate
these
thoughts
as
expressed
in
the
model
at
this
time
when
the
world
is
all
but
overcome
with
the
idea
of
individualism
and
while
new
governments
shifting
as
the
sands
conceived
in
greed
envy
and
malice
daily
are
born
struggle
and
die
our
proposed
monument
represents
and
commemorates
such
ideal
in
steadfastness
and
progress
as
should
be
a
lesson
and
an
inspiration
to
this
and
to
succeeding
generations
the
back
of
the
monument
has
been
most
happily
designed
it
is
the
third
side
of
the
triangle
and
remains
to
be
described
the
central
idea
is
the
dimly
suggested
figure
of
an
indian
woman
of
the
southwestern
type
whose
head
shows
in
relief
against
the
background
peaks
and
whose
body
and
outstretched
arms
draped
in
the
customary
blanket
are
faintly
suggested
in
the
crags
and
rocks
in
fact
the
head
is
the
only
part
of
the
figure
that
is
chiseled
clear
in
outline
the
balance
of
the
figure
being
only
dimly
suggested
of
just
as
the
of
the
west
in
the
front
dominates
and
pervades
so
this
figure
has
the
air
of
receding
and
disappearance
the
evanishment
of
a
former
race
the
figure
is
heroic
in
size
and
beautifully
conceived
on
either
side
really
on
the
lower
folds
of
the
blanket
or
on
the
rocks
whereon
the
blanket
is
suggested
are
two
more
scenes
incidental
to
the
journey
and
labors
of
the
battalion
on
the
right
half
is
a
scene
at
sutter
mill
where
some
of
the
battalion
members
in
digging
the
tailrace
for
the
mill
turned
up
the
first
gold
bearing
gravel
that
led
to
the
great
gold
rush
to
california
in
and
contributed
so
many
millions
to
the
wealth
of
the
country
on
the
left
half
is
shown
a
battalion
man
digging
a
ditch
and
leading
the
water
from
a
creek
to
overflow
the
land
so
that
the
pioneers
could
break
the
ground
that
had
shattered
their
plow
points
and
broken
their
plows
this
was
the
introduction
of
irrigation
into
utah
the
back
of
the
monument
in
its
conception
and
treatment
by
its
stateliness
and
suggested
grandeur
and
what
the
artists
call
made
a
distinct
impression
upon
the
committee
and
no
changes
or
modifications
were
thought
of
nor
suggested
it
seemed
a
very
happy
solution
of
a
difficult
problem
from
the
irrigating
stream
and
the
of
the
mill
it
is
designed
to
have
small
streams
of
flowing
water
forming
a
pool
in
the
shape
of
a
half
moon
at
the
rear
and
so
arranged
as
to
pass
this
water
through
to
the
other
side
to
form
two
pools
or
lagoons
on
the
front
side
of
the
monument
immediately
surrounding
the
monument
the
architects
have
laid
out
a
pavement
in
red
brick
tile
with
a
border
of
an
indian
design
this
dark
tile
will
save
the
glare
and
dazzling
reflection
of
the
bright
sun
of
our
clear
atmosphere
upon
a
white
granite
monument
there
are
also
graceful
and
symmetrical
walks
a
granite
coping
and
seats
suitably
located
and
arranged
to
give
everyone
ample
opportunity
for
a
casual
or
studied
view
of
the
monument
and
its
parts
beyond
these
walks
and
seats
immediately
around
the
monument
the
pools
lagoon
and
walks
are
designed
to
join
in
and
harmonize
with
the
rest
of
the
capitol
grounds
nothing
like
this
monument
has
ever
been
designed
or
built
before
it
is
original
and
unique
few
states
can
boast
the
achievements
such
as
are
commemorated
in
this
design
more
than
years
have
elapsed
since
the
battalion
made
its
memorable
march
and
the
most
of
its
members
have
passed
to
the
great
beyond
so
this
monument
should
be
built
at
once
if
we
are
to
proceed
according
to
first
hand
evidence
and
information
and
not
according
to
more
or
less
fanciful
and
legendary
tales
concerning
them
and
their
difficult
journey
it
is
sufficiently
creditable
and
glorifying
to
tell
their
history
as
it
was
and
without
adornment
the
most
important
events
are
to
be
shown
in
bronze
and
stone
upon
this
monument
its
execution
will
certainly
tax
the
sculptor
to
his
utmost
but
i
believe
it
is
in
thoroughly
capable
hands
and
when
built
will
be
one
of
the
really
great
monuments
of
the
united
states
therefore
let
us
adhere
to
the
proposed
model
with
steadfast
purpose
to
build
it
not
only
as
an
added
attraction
to
the
many
we
have
for
the
tourist
and
visitor
but
more
especially
as
an
object
of
great
interest
for
study
and
inspiration
for
our
children
and
our
children
children
duty
of
the
people
of
such
is
the
monument
to
be
erected
in
commemoration
of
this
great
march
of
infantry
whose
achievements
are
so
closely
and
inseparably
connected
with
winning
for
the
united
states
her
present
inheritance
in
the
intermountain
west
and
on
the
shores
of
the
pacific
also
whose
achievements
and
glory
are
so
inseparably
connected
with
the
founding
of
the
state
of
utah
as
the
work
of
part
of
her
builders
it
is
the
duty
of
the
people
of
utah
to
whom
appeal
is
now
made
to
raise
the
necessary
to
make
the
appropriation
of
a
like
amount
available
to
build
the
monument
to
fail
in
such
a
duty
would
be
to
disgrace
the
state
no
other
state
in
the
union
has
such
a
unique
incident
to
celebrate
as
this
battalion
incident
in
our
utah
pioneer
history
it
is
both
heroic
and
dramatic
and
in
the
results
achieved
is
one
of
the
largest
events
contributed
by
any
state
to
the
history
of
our
country
utah
owes
it
to
the
state
and
to
the
nation
to
build
this
monument
that
memory
of
this
greatest
march
of
infantry
in
the
world
and
the
heroism
of
those
who
made
it
shall
not
perish
from
among
men
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
utah
state
mormon
battalion
monument
commission
to
raise
this
fund
by
the
day
of
january
battalion
day
being
the
anniversary
of
the
official
ending
of
their
march
and

the
respective
counties
have
been

for

funds
subscription
lists
have

it
is
proposed
to
conduct
a
campaign
of
public
meetings
in
the
interest
of
the
monument
throughout
utah
and
the
surrounding
states
and
give
the
people
of
the
west
every
opportunity
to
honor
themselves
and
their
posterity
