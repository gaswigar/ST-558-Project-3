team
christmas
with
grandma
elsie
by
martha
finley
author
of
at
and
a
etc
chapter
i
it
was
about
the
middle
of
november
there
had
been
a
long
rain
storm
ending
in
sleet
and
snow
and
now
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
on
a
landscape
sheeted
with
ice
walks
and
roads
were
slippery
with
it
every
tree
and
shrub
was
encased
in
it
and
glittering
and
sparkling
as
if
loaded
with
diamonds
as
its
branches
swayed
and
tossed
in
the
wind
at
ion
elsie
travilla
stood
at
the
window
of
her
gazing
with
delighted
eyes
upon
the
lovely
scene
how
beautiful
she
said
softly
to
herself
and
my
father
made
it
all
gives
snow
like
wool
he
scattereth
the
hoar
frost
like
ashes
he
casteth
forth
his
ice
like
morsels
ah
good
morning
my
dears
as
the
door
opened
and
rosie
and
walter
came
in
together
good
morning
dearest
mamma
they
returned
hastening
to
her
to
give
and
receive
the
affectionate
kiss
with
which
they
were
accustomed
to
meet
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
day
i
so
glad
the
long
storm
is
over
at
last
said
rosie
it
is
really
delightful
to
see
the
sunshine
once
more
and
the
beautiful
work
of
the
frost
king
reflecting
his
rays
added
her
mother
calling
their
attention
to
the
new
beauties
of
the
ever
attractive
landscape
spread
out
before
them
both
exclaimed
in
delight
how
beautiful
mamma
rosie
adding
it
must
be
that
the
roads
are
in
fine
condition
for
sleighing
i
hope
we
can
go
o
mamma
ca
we
cried
walter
wo
you
give
us
a
holiday
i
shall
take
the
question
into
consideration
she
answered
with
an
indulgent
smile
we
will
perhaps
discuss
it
at
the
breakfast
table
but
now
we
will
have
our
reading
together
at
that
very
time
capt
raymond
and
violet
in
her
boudoir
at
woodburn
were
also
discussing
the
state
of
the
roads
and
the
advisability
of
dispensing
with
school
duties
for
the
day
that
all
the
family
might
enjoy
the
rather
rare
treat
of
a
you
would
enjoy
it
my
love
he
said
inquiringly
very
much
in
company
with
my
husband
and
the
children
she
returned
yet
i
would
not
wish
to
influence
you
to
decide
against
your
convictions
in
regard
to
what
is
right
and
wise
we
will
go
he
said
smiling
fondly
upon
her
i
can
not
bear
to
have
you
miss
the
pleasure
nor
the
children
either
for
that
matter
though
i
am
a
little
afraid
i
might
justly
be
deemed
weakly
indulgent
in
according
them
a
holiday
again
so
soon
it
is
against
my
principles
to
allow
lessons
to
be
set
aside
for
other
than
very
weighty
reasons
it
is
a
matter
of
so
great
importance
that
they
be
trained
to
put
duties
first
giving
pleasure
a
secondary
place
but
they
are
so
good
and
industrious
said
violet
and
the
sleighing
is
not
likely
to
last
long
it
seldom
does
with
us
and
they
have
been
so
closely
confined
to
the
house
of
late
by
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
he
added
yes
they
shall
go
for
it
will
do
them
a
great
deal
of
good
physically
i
think
and
health
is
after
all
of
more
consequence
for
them
than
rapid
advancement
in
their
studies
i
should
think
so
indeed
said
violet
now
the
next
question
is
where
shall
we
go
that
is
a
question
for
my
wife
to
settle
returned
the
captain
gallantly
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
accompany
her
wherever
she
decides
that
she
wishes
to
be
taken
thank
you
sir
i
want
to
see
mamma
of
course
then
we
will
call
at
ion
and
perhaps
may
be
able
to
persuade
mother
to
join
us
in
a
longer
ride
oh
could
we
hire
an
omnibus
sleigh
and
ask
them
all
to
join
us
it
would
just
about
hold
the
two
families
it
is
a
trifle
odd
that
the
same
idea
had
just
occurred
to
me
he
remarked
pleasantly
i
will
telephone
at
once
to
the
town
and
if
i
can
engage
a
suitable
sleigh
will
call
to
ion
and
give
our
invitation
the
reply
from
the
village
was
satisfactory
also
that
from
ion
given
by
grandpa
dinsmore
who
said
he
would
venture
to
accept
the
invitation
for
all
the
family
without
waiting
to
consult
them
the
captain
reported
to
violet
then
passed
on
into
the
apartments
of
his
little
daughters
he
found
them
up
and
dressed
standing
at
the
window
of
their
gazing
out
into
the
grounds
good
morning
my
darlings
he
said
oh
good
morning
papa
they
cried
turning
and
running
into
his
outstretched
arms
to
give
and
receive
tenderest
caresses
what
were
you
looking
at
he
asked
presently
oh
oh
the
loveliest
sight
cried
lulu
do
papa
come
and
look
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
toward
the
window
there
is
it
yes
i
have
seldom
seen
a
finer
he
assented
and
the
sun
is
shining
so
brightly
ca
i
take
a
walk
with
you
she
asked
looking
coaxingly
up
into
his
face
why
my
child
the
walks
and
roads
are
sheeted
with
ice
you
could
not
stand
much
less
walk
on
them
i
think
i
could
papa
if
if
you
only
let
me
try
but
oh
do
look
troubled
for
indeed
indeed
i
not
going
to
be
naughty
about
it
though
i
have
been
shut
up
in
the
house
for
so
long
except
just
riding
in
the
close
carriage
to
church
yesterday
yes
and
i
know
it
has
been
hard
for
you
he
said
smoothing
her
hair
with
caressing
hand
then
sitting
down
he
drew
her
to
one
knee
gracie
to
the
other
how
would
my
little
girls
like
to
be
excused
from
lessons
and
given
instead
a
with
papa
mamma
max
and
little
elsie
oh
ever
so
much
papa
they
cried
clapping
their
hands
in
delight
how
good
in
you
to
think
of
it
for
me
considering
how
very
very
naughty
i
was
only
last
week
added
lulu
in
a
remorseful
tone
papa
i
really
think
i
ought
to
be
let
go
and
i
really
think
i
should
not
be
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
having
my
dear
eldest
daughter
with
me
on
this
first
of
the
season
returned
her
father
drawing
her
into
a
closer
embrace
and
it
would
spoil
all
the
fun
for
me
to
have
you
left
at
home
lu
said
grace
and
that
must
not
be
we
will
all
go
and
i
trust
will
have
a
very
pleasant
time
the
captain
said
rising
and
taking
a
hand
of
each
to
lead
them
down
to
the
for
the
bell
was
ringing
at
ion
the
family
were
gathering
about
the
table
to
partake
of
their
morning
meal
walter
waited
rather
impatiently
till
the
blessing
had
been
asked
then
with
an
entreating
look
at
his
mother
said
mamma
you
know
what
you
promised
yes
my
son
but
be
patient
a
little
longer
i
see
your
grandpa
has
something
to
say
something
that
walter
will
be
glad
to
hear
i
make
no
doubt
remarked
dinsmore
giving
the
child
a
kindly
look
and
smile
capt
raymond
and
i
have
had
a
little
chat
through
the
telephone
this
morning
he
invites
us
all
to
join
the
woodburn
family
in
a
he
is
coming
for
us
in
an
omnibus
sleigh
and
i
accepted
for
each
and
every
one
of
you
zoe
rosie
and
walter
uttered
a
simultaneous
exclamation
of
delight
while
the
others
looked
well
pleased
with
the
arrangement
at
what
hour
are
we
to
expect
the
captain
asked
dinsmore
about
ten
and
where
does
he
propose
to
take
us
inquired
zoe
i
presume
wherever
the
ladies
of
the
party
decide
that
they
would
like
to
go
surely
papa
the
gentlemen
also
should
have
a
voice
in
that
his
daughter
said
sending
him
a
bright
affectionate
look
from
behind
the
you
at
least
in
case
the
question
is
put
to
vote
not
i
more
than
the
rest
of
you
he
returned
pleasantly
but
i
have
no
doubt
we
would
all
enjoy
the
ride
in
any
direction
where
the
sleighing
is
good
i
think
it
will
prove
fine
on
all
the
roads
remarked
edward
and
i
presume
everybody
would
enjoy
driving
over
to
fairview
the
laurels
and
the
oaks
to
call
on
our
nearest
relatives
perhaps
to
the
pines
and
roselands
also
to
see
the
cousins
there
that
would
be
nice
said
zoe
but
do
you
suppose
they
may
be
improving
the
sleighing
opportunity
as
well
as
ourselves
may
be
driving
over
here
to
call
on
us
then
when
we
meet
the
question
will
be
who
shall
turn
round
and
go
back
and
who
keep
on
laughed
rosie
but
to
avoid
such
an
unpleasant
state
of
affairs
we
have
only
to
ask
and
answer
a
few
questions
through
the
telephone
said
edward
certainly
said
his
grandfather
and
we
attend
to
it
the
first
thing
on
leaving
the
table
everybody
was
interested
and
presently
all
were
gathered
about
the
telephone
while
edward
acting
as
spokesman
of
the
party
called
to
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
households
nearly
related
to
themselves
the
answers
came
promptly
and
it
was
soon
evident
that
all
were
intending
to
avail
themselves
of
the
somewhat
rare
opportunity
offered
by
the
snow
and
ice
covered
roads
none
planning
to
stay
at
home
to
receive
calls
they
would
all
visit
ion
if
the
ladies
there
were
likely
to
be
in
tell
them
said
grandma
elsie
to
take
their
drives
this
morning
come
to
ion
in
time
for
dinner
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
and
evening
here
i
shall
be
much
pleased
to
have
them
all
do
so
the
message
went
the
rounds
everybody
accepted
the
invitation
and
elsie
orders
for
the
day
to
cook
and
housekeeper
were
given
accordingly
the
woodburn
party
arrived
in
high
spirits
a
sleigh
containing
the
fairview
family
driving
up
at
the
same
time
they
had
room
for
one
more
and
wanted
mamma
to
occupy
it
but
the
captain
and
violet
would
not
resign
their
claim
and
evelyn
and
lulu
showed
a
strong
desire
to
be
together
so
the
former
was
transferred
to
the
woodburn
sleigh
and
zoe
and
edward
took
the
vacant
seats
in
that
from
fairview
the
two
vehicles
kept
near
together
their
occupants
the
children
especially
were
very
gay
and
lively
they
talked
of
last
year
holiday
sports
and
indulged
in
pleasing
anticipations
in
regard
to
what
might
be
in
store
for
them
in
those
now
drawing
near
we
had
a
fine
time
at
the
oaks
had
we
girls
said
max
addressing
evelyn
and
rosie
yes
they
replied
but
a
still
better
one
at
woodburn
when
are
you
and
lu
going
to
invite
us
again
asked
rosie
when
papa
gives
permission
answered
max
sending
a
smiling
persuasive
glance
in
his
father
direction
it
is
quite
possible
you
may
not
have
very
long
to
wait
for
that
max
was
the
kindly
indulgent
rejoinder
from
the
captain
it
is
rosie
turn
this
year
remarked
grandma
elsie
rosie
and
walter
and
mine
i
want
all
the
young
people
of
the
connection
and
as
many
of
the
older
ones
as
we
can
make
room
for
to
come
to
ion
for
the
christmas
holidays
or
at
least
the
greater
part
of
them
we
will
settle
particulars
as
to
the
time
of
coming
and
going
later
on
captain
i
want
you
and
violet
and
all
your
children
for
the
whole
time
thank
you
mother
you
are
most
kind
and
i
do
not
now
see
anything
in
the
way
of
our
acceptance
of
your
invitation
he
said
but
added
with
a
playful
look
at
violet
unless
my
wife
should
object
if
i
should
mamma
you
will
receive
my
regrets
in
due
season
laughed
violet
the
faces
of
the
children
were
beaming
with
delight
and
their
young
voices
united
in
a
chorus
of
expressions
of
pleasure
and
thanks
to
grandma
elsie
i
am
glad
you
are
all
pleased
with
the
idea
she
said
we
will
try
to
provide
as
great
a
variety
of
amusements
as
possible
and
shall
be
glad
of
any
hints
or
suggestions
from
old
or
young
in
regard
to
anything
new
in
that
line
we
will
all
try
to
help
you
mamma
violet
said
and
not
be
jealous
or
envious
if
your
party
should
far
outshine
ours
of
last
year
and
we
have
more
than
a
month
to
get
ready
in
remarked
rosie
with
satisfaction
oh
i
so
glad
mamma
has
decided
on
it
in
such
good
season
hello
cried
max
glancing
back
toward
an
intersecting
road
which
they
had
just
crossed
here
they
come
who
asked
several
voices
while
all
turned
their
heads
to
see
for
themselves
the
oaks
and
the
roselands
folks
answered
max
and
as
he
spoke
two
large
sleighs
came
swiftly
up
in
the
rear
of
their
own
their
occupants
calling
out
merry
greetings
and
receiving
a
return
in
kind
the
wind
had
fallen
the
cold
was
not
intense
and
they
were
so
well
protected
against
it
by
coats
and
robes
of
fur
that
they
scarcely
felt
it
and
found
the
ride
so
thoroughly
enjoyable
that
they
kept
it
up
through
the
whole
morning
managing
their
return
so
that
ion
was
reached
only
a
few
minutes
before
the
dinner
hour
ion
was
a
sort
of
headquarters
for
the
entire
connection
and
everybody
seemed
to
feel
perfectly
at
home
grandma
elsie
was
a
most
hospitable
hostess
and
it
was
a
very
cheerful
jovial
party
that
surrounded
her
table
that
day
after
dinner
while
the
older
people
conversed
together
in
the
parlors
the
younger
ones
wandered
at
will
through
the
house
the
girls
were
together
in
a
small
chatting
about
such
matters
as
particularly
interested
them
their
studies
sports
plans
for
the
purchase
or
making
of
christmas
gifts
and
what
they
hoped
or
desired
to
receive
i
want
jewelry
said
sidney
dinsmore
i
rather
have
that
than
anything
else
but
it
must
be
handsome
a
diamond
pin
or
ring
or
mamma
says
diamonds
are
quite
unsuitable
for
young
girls
said
rosie
so
i
prefer
pearls
and
i
rather
in
hopes
she
may
give
me
some
for
christmas
i
rather
have
diamonds
anyhow
persisted
sydney
see
maud
new
ring
just
sent
her
by
a
rich
old
aunt
of
ours
i
sure
it
looks
lovely
on
her
finger
and
shows
off
the
beauty
of
her
hand
yes
i
been
admiring
it
said
lulu
and
i
thought
i
never
seen
it
before
maud
held
out
her
hand
with
evident
pride
and
satisfaction
while
the
others
gathered
round
her
eager
for
a
close
inspection
of
the
ring
they
all
admired
it
greatly
and
maud
seemed
gratified
yes
she
said
it
certainly
is
a
beauty
and
chess
says
it
must
be
worth
a
good
deal
that
centre
stone
is
quite
large
you
see
and
there
are
six
others
in
a
circle
around
it
i
should
think
you
feel
very
rich
remarked
lulu
i
go
fairly
wild
with
delight
if
i
had
such
an
one
given
me
well
then
why
not
give
your
father
a
hint
that
you
like
such
a
christmas
gift
from
him
asked
sydney
i
afraid
it
would
cost
too
much
said
lulu
and
i
would
want
papa
to
spend
more
on
me
than
he
could
well
afford
why
he
could
afford
it
well
enough
exclaimed
maud
your
father
is
very
rich
worth
his
millions
i
heard
cousin
horace
say
not
long
ago
and
he
knows
of
course
lulu
looked
much
surprised
papa
never
talks
of
how
much
money
he
has
she
said
and
i
never
supposed
it
was
more
than
about
enough
to
keep
us
comfortable
but
millions
means
a
great
deal
does
it
i
should
say
so
indeed
more
than
your
mind
or
mine
can
grasp
the
idea
of
lulu
eyes
sparkled
i
ever
so
glad
for
papa
she
said
he
just
the
right
person
to
have
a
great
deal
of
money
for
he
will
be
sure
to
make
the
very
best
use
of
it
and
for
a
part
of
it
that
will
be
diamonds
for
you
wo
it
laughed
maud
i
hope
the
captain
will
think
so
by
the
time
she
grown
up
remarked
rosie
with
a
pleasant
look
at
lulu
or
sooner
if
they
come
to
be
thought
suitable
for
girls
of
her
age
that
nice
in
you
rosie
lulu
said
flushing
with
pleasure
and
i
hope
you
will
get
your
pearls
this
christmas
i
join
in
both
wishes
said
evelyn
leland
and
hope
everyone
of
you
will
receive
a
christmas
gift
quite
to
her
mind
but
oh
girls
you
think
it
would
be
nice
to
give
a
good
time
to
the
poor
people
about
us
what
poor
people
asked
sydney
i
mean
both
the
whites
and
the
blacks
explained
evelyn
there
are
those
jones
children
that
live
not
far
from
woodburn
for
instance
their
mother
dead
and
the
father
gets
drunk
and
beats
and
abuses
them
and
altogether
i
sure
they
are
very
very
forlorn
oh
yes
cried
lulu
it
would
be
just
splendid
to
give
them
a
good
time
nice
things
to
eat
and
to
wear
and
toys
too
i
talk
to
papa
about
it
and
he
tell
us
what
to
give
them
and
how
to
give
it
and
there
are
a
number
of
other
families
in
the
neighborhood
probably
quite
as
poor
and
forlorn
said
lora
howard
oh
i
think
it
would
be
delightful
to
get
them
all
together
somewhere
and
surprise
them
with
a
christmas
tree
loaded
with
nice
things
lets
do
it
girls
we
all
have
some
pocket
money
and
we
can
get
our
fathers
and
mothers
to
tell
us
how
to
use
it
to
the
best
advantage
and
how
to
manage
the
giving
i
have
a
bit
more
pocket
money
than
i
need
to
buy
the
presents
i
wish
to
give
my
own
particular
friends
objected
sydney
it
nice
and
right
too
i
think
to
give
tokens
of
love
to
our
dear
ones
evelyn
said
but
we
need
not
make
them
very
expensive
in
order
to
give
pleasure
often
they
would
prefer
some
simple
little
thing
that
is
the
work
of
our
own
hands
and
so
we
would
have
something
left
for
the
poor
and
needy
whom
the
bible
teaches
us
we
should
care
for
and
relieve
to
the
best
of
our
ability
yes
i
daresay
you
are
right
returned
sydney
but
i
make
any
rash
promises
in
regard
to
the
matter
chapter
ii
in
the
parlor
the
older
people
were
conversing
on
somewhat
similar
topics
first
discussing
plans
for
the
entertainment
and
gratification
of
their
children
and
other
young
relatives
during
the
approaching
holidays
then
of
the
needs
of
the
poor
of
the
neighborhood
and
how
to
supply
them
after
that
they
talked
of
the
claims
of
home
and
foreign
missions
the
perils
threatening
their
country
from
illiteracy
anarchy
heathenism
mormonism
popery
infidelity
not
omitting
the
danger
from
vast
wealth
accumulating
in
the
hands
of
individuals
and
corporations
also
they
spoke
of
the
heavy
responsibility
entailed
by
its
possession
they
were
patriots
and
christians
anxious
first
of
all
for
the
advancement
of
christ
kingdom
upon
earth
secondly
for
the
welfare
and
prosperity
of
the
dear
land
of
their
birth
the
glorious
old
union
transmitted
to
us
by
our
revolutionary
fathers
it
was
a
personal
question
with
each
one
how
can
i
best
use
for
the
salvation
of
my
country
and
the
world
the
time
talents
influence
and
money
god
has
entrusted
to
my
keeping
they
acknowledged
themselves
stewards
of
god
bounty
and
as
such
desired
to
be
found
faithful
neglecting
neither
the
work
nearest
at
hand
nor
that
in
far
distant
lands
where
the
people
sit
in
great
darkness
and
the
region
and
shadow
of
death
that
on
them
the
sun
of
righteousness
might
arise
with
healing
in
his
wings
it
had
been
expected
that
the
guests
would
stay
at
ion
till
bedtime
but
a
thaw
had
set
in
and
ice
and
snow
were
fast
disappearing
from
the
roads
therefore
all
departed
for
their
homes
directly
after
an
early
tea
lulu
was
very
quiet
during
the
homeward
drive
her
thoughts
were
full
of
maud
surprising
assertion
in
regard
to
her
father
wealth
i
wonder
if
it
is
really
so
she
said
to
herself
i
tempted
to
ask
papa
but
he
might
not
like
it
and
i
would
want
to
do
anything
to
vex
or
trouble
him
my
dear
dear
kind
father
an
excellent
opportunity
for
a
private
chat
with
him
was
afforded
her
shortly
after
their
arrival
at
home
the
little
ones
were
fretful
and
violet
went
to
the
nursery
with
them
max
hastened
to
his
own
room
to
finish
a
composition
he
was
expected
to
hand
to
his
father
the
next
morning
gracie
weary
with
the
excitement
of
the
day
and
the
long
morning
drive
went
directly
to
her
bed
and
having
seen
her
in
it
and
left
her
there
with
a
loving
good
night
the
captain
and
lulu
presently
found
themselves
the
only
occupants
of
the
library
taking
possession
of
a
large
easy
chair
come
and
sit
on
my
knee
and
tell
me
how
you
have
enjoyed
your
day
he
said
giving
her
a
fond
fatherly
smile
very
much
indeed
papa
she
answered
accepting
his
invitation
putting
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
laying
her
cheek
to
his
his
arm
was
around
her
waist
he
drew
her
closer
saying
softly
my
dear
dear
little
daughter
i
thought
you
were
unusually
quiet
coming
home
is
anything
amiss
with
you
oh
no
papa
i
had
a
lovely
time
all
day
long
how
kind
you
were
to
give
us
all
a
holiday
and
let
me
go
along
with
the
rest
of
you
good
to
myself
as
well
as
to
you
my
darlings
i
could
have
had
very
little
enjoyment
leaving
you
behind
papa
it
so
nice
to
have
you
love
me
so
she
said
kissing
him
with
ardent
affection
oh
i
do
hope
i
never
be
very
naughty
again
i
hope
not
dear
child
he
responded
returning
her
caresses
i
hope
you
feel
ready
to
resume
your
studies
with
diligence
and
painstaking
yes
papa
i
think
i
do
it
almost
a
week
since
you
have
heard
me
recite
except
the
sunday
lesson
yesterday
yes
he
said
gravely
it
has
been
something
of
a
loss
to
you
in
one
way
but
i
trust
a
decided
gain
in
another
well
to
change
the
subject
are
you
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
spending
the
holidays
at
ion
yes
papa
i
think
it
will
be
lovely
almost
as
nice
as
having
a
party
of
our
own
as
we
did
last
year
possibly
we
may
add
that
a
party
here
for
a
day
or
two
if
grandma
elsie
does
not
use
up
all
the
holidays
with
hers
he
said
in
a
half
jesting
tone
and
with
a
pleasant
laugh
o
papa
do
you
really
think
we
may
she
cried
in
delight
oh
you
are
just
the
kindest
father
giving
him
a
hug
he
laughed
at
that
returning
the
hug
with
interest
i
suppose
you
and
eva
and
the
rest
were
laying
out
plans
for
christmas
doings
this
afternoon
he
said
inquiringly
yes
papa
we
were
talking
a
good
deal
about
games
and
tableaux
and
about
the
things
we
could
buy
or
make
for
gifts
to
our
friends
and
what
we
would
like
to
have
given
us
she
paused
half
hoping
he
would
ask
what
she
wanted
from
him
but
he
did
not
he
sat
silently
caressing
her
hair
and
cheek
with
his
hand
and
seemingly
lost
in
thought
at
length
papa
she
asked
half
hesitatingly
are
you
very
rich
rich
he
repeated
coming
suddenly
out
of
his
reverie
and
looking
smilingly
down
into
her
eyes
yes
i
have
a
sound
constitution
excellent
health
a
delightful
home
a
wife
and
five
children
each
one
of
whom
i
esteem
worth
at
least
a
million
to
me
i
live
in
a
christian
land
he
went
on
in
a
graver
tone
i
have
the
bible
with
all
its
great
and
precious
promises
the
hope
of
a
blessed
eternity
at
god
right
hand
and
that
all
my
dear
ones
are
traveling
heavenward
with
me
yes
i
am
a
very
rich
man
yes
sir
but
i
meant
have
you
a
great
deal
of
money
enough
to
provide
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
comfort
of
my
family
and
to
gratify
any
reasonable
desire
on
the
part
of
my
little
girl
what
is
it
you
want
my
darling
papa
i
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
she
said
blushing
and
hanging
her
head
but
if
i
do
and
you
ca
afford
it
wo
you
please
say
so
and
not
feel
sorry
about
it
because
i
would
ever
want
you
to
spend
money
on
me
that
you
need
for
yourself
or
some
of
the
others
i
am
glad
you
are
thoughtful
for
others
as
well
as
yourself
daughter
he
said
kindly
but
do
hesitate
to
tell
me
all
that
is
in
your
heart
nothing
pleases
me
better
than
to
have
you
and
all
my
dear
children
do
so
thank
you
my
dear
dear
papa
i
do
mean
ever
to
hide
anything
from
you
she
returned
giving
him
another
hug
and
kiss
while
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
cheek
flushed
with
pleasure
it
a
diamond
ring
like
to
have
a
diamond
ring
he
repeated
in
surprise
what
would
my
little
girl
do
with
such
a
thing
as
that
wear
it
papa
maud
dinsmore
has
such
beautiful
one
that
a
rich
aunt
sent
her
the
other
day
she
went
on
eagerly
there
a
large
diamond
in
the
middle
and
little
ones
all
round
it
and
it
sparkles
so
and
looks
just
lovely
on
her
hand
we
all
admired
it
ever
so
much
and
i
said
i
be
wild
with
delight
if
i
had
such
an
one
then
sydney
said
not
give
your
father
a
hint
that
you
like
one
for
christmas
and
i
said
i
was
afraid
you
could
afford
to
give
me
anything
that
would
cost
so
much
but
maud
said
i
need
be
for
you
were
worth
millions
of
money
can
you
really
afford
to
give
it
to
me
papa
i
like
it
better
than
anything
else
if
you
can
but
if
you
ca
i
do
want
it
she
concluded
with
a
sigh
and
creeping
closer
into
his
embrace
he
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
but
though
grave
and
thoughtful
his
countenance
was
quite
free
from
displeasure
and
when
at
length
he
spoke
his
tones
were
very
kind
and
affectionate
if
i
thought
it
would
really
be
for
my
little
girl
welfare
and
happiness
in
the
end
he
said
i
should
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
gratify
her
in
this
wish
of
hers
but
daughter
the
ornament
you
covet
would
be
extremely
unsuitable
for
one
of
your
years
and
i
fear
its
possession
would
foster
a
love
of
finery
that
i
do
not
wish
to
cultivate
in
you
because
it
is
not
right
and
would
hinder
you
in
the
race
i
trust
you
are
running
for
the
prize
of
eternal
life
the
bible
tells
us
we
can
not
serve
both
god
and
mammon
can
not
love
him
and
the
world
too
any
man
love
the
world
the
love
of
the
father
is
not
in
him
god
has
entrusted
me
with
a
good
deal
of
money
but
i
hold
it
as
his
steward
and
is
required
in
stewards
that
a
man
be
found
faithful
i
do
know
what
you
mean
papa
she
said
with
look
and
tone
of
keen
disappointment
that
i
must
use
the
lord
money
to
do
his
work
daughter
a
great
deal
of
money
is
needed
to
help
on
the
advancement
of
his
cause
and
kingdom
in
the
hearts
of
individuals
and
in
the
world
at
large
there
are
millions
of
poor
creatures
in
heathen
lands
who
have
never
so
much
as
heard
of
jesus
and
his
dying
love
and
even
in
our
own
favored
country
there
are
thousands
who
are
sunk
in
poverty
ignorance
and
wretchedness
money
is
needed
to
feed
and
clothe
them
to
send
them
teachers
and
preachers
and
to
build
churches
schools
and
colleges
where
they
can
be
educated
and
fitted
for
happiness
and
usefulness
suppose
i
had
a
thousand
or
five
thousand
dollars
to
spare
after
supplying
my
family
with
all
that
is
necessary
for
health
comfort
and
happiness
could
my
dear
eldest
daughter
be
so
selfish
as
to
wish
me
to
put
it
into
a
diamond
ring
for
her
at
the
expense
of
leaving
some
poor
creature
in
want
and
misery
some
poor
heathen
to
die
without
the
knowledge
of
christ
some
soul
to
be
lost
that
jesus
died
to
save
oh
no
no
papa
she
exclaimed
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
i
could
be
so
hard
hearted
i
could
bear
to
look
at
my
ring
if
it
had
cost
so
much
to
other
people
no
i
am
sure
you
could
not
and
i
believe
you
would
find
far
more
enjoyment
a
far
sweeter
pleasure
in
selecting
objects
for
me
to
benefit
by
the
money
the
ring
might
cost
o
papa
how
nice
how
delightful
that
would
be
if
you
would
let
me
she
cried
joyously
i
will
he
said
i
have
some
thousands
to
divide
among
the
various
religious
and
benevolent
objects
and
shall
give
a
certain
sum
perhaps
as
much
as
a
thousand
dollars
in
the
name
of
each
of
my
three
children
who
are
old
enough
to
understand
these
things
letting
each
of
you
select
the
cause
or
causes
to
which
his
or
her
share
is
to
go
which
are
the
causes
papa
she
asked
her
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
there
are
home
and
foreign
missions
the
work
among
the
freedmen
and
for
the
destitute
in
our
own
neighborhood
beside
very
many
others
we
will
read
about
these
various
objects
and
talk
the
matter
over
together
and
finally
decide
how
many
we
can
help
and
how
much
shall
be
given
to
each
perhaps
you
may
choose
to
support
a
little
indian
girl
in
one
of
the
mission
schools
or
some
child
in
heathen
lands
or
a
missionary
who
will
go
and
teach
them
the
way
to
heaven
oh
i
should
love
to
do
that
she
exclaimed
it
will
be
better
than
having
a
ring
papa
how
good
you
are
to
me
i
am
so
glad
god
gave
me
such
a
father
one
who
tries
always
to
teach
me
how
to
serve
him
and
to
help
me
to
be
the
right
kind
of
a
christian
i
want
to
help
you
in
that
my
darling
he
said
i
think
i
could
do
you
no
greater
kindness
just
then
max
came
into
the
room
and
his
father
called
him
to
take
a
seat
by
his
side
saying
i
am
glad
you
have
come
my
son
for
i
was
about
to
speak
to
lulu
on
a
subject
that
concerns
you
quite
as
nearly
yes
sir
i
be
glad
to
listen
replied
max
doing
as
directed
the
captain
went
on
the
bible
tells
us
any
man
have
not
the
spirit
of
christ
he
is
none
of
his
if
we
are
like
jesus
in
spirit
we
will
love
others
and
be
ready
to
deny
ourselves
to
do
them
good
especially
to
save
their
souls
for
to
that
end
he
denied
himself
even
to
the
shameful
and
painful
death
of
the
cross
he
says
any
man
will
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
me
whosoever
doth
not
bear
his
cross
and
come
after
me
can
not
be
my
disciple
that
is
we
can
not
be
his
disciples
without
doing
something
to
bring
sinners
to
him
that
they
may
be
saved
something
that
will
cost
us
it
may
be
of
our
own
ease
or
of
something
we
would
like
to
do
or
have
and
it
must
be
done
willingly
cheerfully
from
love
to
the
dear
master
and
the
souls
he
died
to
save
and
not
as
the
way
to
earn
heaven
for
ourselves
we
can
not
merit
salvation
do
what
we
will
we
must
take
it
as
free
undeserved
gift
there
was
a
moment
of
thoughtful
silence
then
max
said
papa
i
think
i
am
willing
if
i
knew
just
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
can
you
tell
me
you
have
some
money
of
your
own
every
week
you
can
give
what
you
will
of
that
to
held
spread
abroad
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
you
can
pray
for
others
and
when
a
favorable
opportunity
offers
speak
a
word
to
lead
them
to
christ
ask
god
to
show
you
opportunities
and
give
you
grace
and
wisdom
to
use
them
try
also
so
to
live
and
act
and
speak
that
all
who
see
and
know
you
will
take
knowledge
of
you
that
you
have
been
with
jesus
and
learned
of
him
papa
said
lulu
wo
you
tell
max
about
the
money
you
are
going
to
give
in
our
names
no
i
will
let
you
have
that
pleasure
the
captain
answered
with
a
kindly
look
and
tone
and
she
eagerly
availed
herself
of
the
permission
max
was
greatly
pleased
and
violet
who
joined
them
just
in
time
to
hear
what
lulu
was
saying
highly
approved
but
you
will
understand
children
the
captain
said
that
this
involves
your
gaining
a
great
deal
of
information
on
the
subject
of
missions
and
other
schemes
of
benevolence
and
in
order
to
help
you
in
that
we
will
spend
a
short
time
each
evening
when
not
prevented
by
company
or
some
more
important
engagement
in
reading
and
conversing
on
this
topic
i
wish
i
could
earn
some
money
to
give
said
lulu
i
like
to
carve
pretty
things
to
sell
but
who
would
buy
them
possibly
papa
might
become
an
occasional
purchaser
her
father
said
stroking
her
hair
and
smiling
kindly
upon
her
or
mamma
vi
added
her
young
and
i
have
another
offer
to
make
you
both
said
the
captain
for
every
day
that
i
find
you
obedient
and
industrious
i
will
give
each
of
you
cents
for
benevolent
purposes
thank
you
papa
they
both
said
their
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
max
adding
that
will
be
a
dollar
and
cents
a
week
yes
and
for
every
week
that
either
one
of
you
earns
the
quarter
every
day
i
will
add
another
to
bring
it
up
to
two
dollars
o
papa
how
nice
exclaimed
lulu
i
mean
to
try
very
hard
so
that
i
may
have
enough
to
support
a
little
indian
girl
and
is
gracie
to
have
the
same
certainly
and
i
shall
not
be
greatly
surprised
if
gracie
missionary
box
fills
faster
than
either
of
the
others
i
am
almost
sure
it
will
said
lulu
sobering
down
a
good
deal
and
max
will
be
next
but
i
do
mean
to
try
ever
so
hard
to
be
good
i
am
quite
sure
you
do
dear
child
her
father
responded
in
tender
tones
i
know
my
little
girl
wants
to
improve
and
i
shall
do
all
i
can
to
help
her
papa
is
that
quarter
a
day
for
good
conduct
to
be
in
addition
to
our
usual
pocket
money
asked
max
certainly
my
son
your
pocket
money
is
your
own
to
use
for
your
pleasure
or
profit
except
what
you
feel
that
you
ought
or
desire
to
give
of
it
but
the
quarter
is
expressly
and
only
for
benevolent
purposes
when
may
we
begin
to
earn
it
papa
i
glad
of
that
said
lulu
with
satisfaction
because
i
want
to
earn
a
good
deal
before
christmas
then
she
told
of
evelyn
suggestions
in
regard
to
gifts
for
the
poor
in
their
immediate
neighborhood
a
very
good
idea
her
father
said
and
i
think
it
may
be
carried
out
in
a
way
to
yield
enjoyment
to
both
givers
and
receivers
i
hope
it
will
be
cold
enough
at
christmas
time
to
make
ice
and
snow
for
sleighing
and
sledding
max
remarked
for
we
boys
have
planned
to
have
a
good
deal
of
fun
for
ourselves
and
the
girls
too
if
it
is
you
mean
if
there
is
sleighing
and
sledding
his
father
said
with
an
amused
look
it
might
be
cold
enough
yet
the
needed
snow
or
ice
be
lacking
why
yes
sir
to
be
sure
so
it
might
max
returned
laughing
good
humoredly
what
kind
of
fun
is
it
you
boys
have
planned
for
us
girls
asked
lulu
never
you
mind
said
max
you
see
when
the
time
comes
the
surprise
will
be
half
of
it
you
know
my
dear
you
seem
to
me
a
very
wise
and
kind
father
violet
remarked
to
her
husband
when
they
found
themselves
alone
together
after
max
and
lulu
had
gone
to
their
beds
i
very
highly
approve
of
the
plans
you
have
just
proposed
for
them
though
of
course
the
approval
of
a
silly
young
thing
such
as
i
must
be
a
matter
of
small
consequence
she
added
with
a
merry
laughing
look
up
into
his
face
young
but
not
silly
he
returned
with
a
very
look
and
smile
i
consider
my
wife
judgment
worth
a
great
deal
and
am
highly
gratified
with
her
approval
i
am
extremely
desirous
he
went
on
more
gravely
to
train
my
darlings
to
systematic
benevolence
a
willingness
to
deny
themselves
for
the
cause
of
christ
and
to
take
an
interest
in
every
branch
of
the
work
of
the
church
chapter
iii
lulu
first
thought
on
awaking
the
next
morning
was
of
the
talk
of
the
previous
evening
with
her
father
he
had
said
she
might
have
the
pleasure
of
telling
gracie
the
good
news
in
regard
to
the
money
to
be
earned
by
good
conduct
and
that
which
was
to
be
given
by
him
in
the
name
of
each
of
his
older
children
also
the
privilege
he
would
accord
them
of
selecting
the
particular
cause
or
causes
to
which
the
money
should
go
eager
to
avail
herself
of
the
permission
and
see
gracie
delight
she
sprang
from
her
bed
ran
to
the
door
of
communication
between
their
sleeping
rooms
which
generally
stood
open
always
at
night
and
peeped
cautiously
in
gracie
head
was
still
on
her
pillow
but
at
that
instant
she
stirred
opened
her
eyes
and
called
out
in
a
pleased
tone
o
lu
so
you
are
up
first
speaking
softly
though
for
fear
of
disturbing
their
father
and
violet
in
the
room
beyond
the
door
there
being
open
also
lulu
hurried
to
it
and
closed
it
gently
then
turning
toward
her
sister
yes
she
said
but
it
early
and
you
need
get
up
just
yet
coming
to
creep
in
with
you
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
tell
you
something
that
i
sure
will
please
you
she
crept
into
grace
bed
as
she
spoke
and
they
lay
for
a
while
clasped
in
each
other
arms
lulu
talking
very
fast
grace
listening
and
now
and
then
putting
in
a
word
or
two
she
was
quite
as
much
pleased
with
what
lulu
had
to
tell
as
the
latter
had
anticipated
oh
wo
it
be
just
lovely
to
have
so
much
money
to
do
good
with
she
exclaimed
when
all
had
been
told
have
we
got
the
very
best
and
dearest
father
in
the
world
i
do
believe
lu
there
another
one
half
so
dear
and
kind
and
nice
we
ought
to
be
ever
such
good
children
yes
but
i
not
sighed
lulu
o
gracie
i
give
anything
to
be
as
good
as
you
are
now
do
talk
so
lu
you
make
me
feel
like
a
hypocrite
because
not
good
said
grace
you
are
at
any
rate
you
a
great
deal
better
than
i
am
asserted
lulu
with
warmth
you
never
disobey
papa
or
get
into
a
passion
and
i
do
think
you
love
finery
as
i
do
gracie
i
want
that
ring
yet
oh
i
should
like
to
have
it
ever
so
much
and
i
ought
to
want
it
very
selfish
because
to
buy
it
would
use
up
money
that
ought
to
go
to
send
missionaries
to
the
heathen
or
do
good
to
some
poor
miserable
creature
and
it
wrong
for
me
to
want
it
because
papa
says
it
would
be
good
for
me
and
if
i
were
as
good
as
i
ought
to
be
never
want
anything
he
does
think
best
for
me
to
have
but
oh
dear
how
can
i
help
it
when
i
so
fond
of
pretty
things
lu
said
grace
softly
i
do
believe
that
if
you
ask
the
lord
jesus
to
help
you
to
quit
wanting
it
he
will
but
if
you
did
care
for
it
it
would
be
denying
yourself
to
do
without
it
for
the
sake
of
the
heathen
maybe
so
but
i
do
believe
papa
would
let
me
have
it
even
if
i
would
consent
to
give
it
up
and
begged
him
ever
so
hard
for
it
no
i
not
for
he
loves
us
too
well
to
give
us
anything
that
he
thinks
will
make
it
harder
for
us
to
love
and
serve
god
and
go
to
heaven
when
we
die
yes
and
of
course
that
the
best
way
for
people
to
love
their
children
it
time
for
me
to
get
up
now
but
you
better
lie
still
a
little
longer
with
that
lulu
slipped
from
the
bed
ran
back
to
her
room
and
kneeling
down
there
gave
thanks
for
the
sleep
of
the
past
night
for
health
and
strength
a
good
home
her
dear
kind
father
to
take
care
of
and
provide
for
her
and
love
her
and
all
her
many
many
comforts
and
blessings
and
confessing
her
sins
she
asked
to
be
forgiven
for
sake
and
to
have
strength
given
her
to
do
all
her
duty
that
day
to
be
patient
obedient
industrious
kind
and
helpful
to
others
and
willing
to
deny
herself
especially
in
the
matter
of
the
ring
she
had
been
wishing
for
so
ardently
when
the
captain
came
into
the
apartments
of
his
little
daughters
for
a
few
minutes
chat
before
breakfast
as
was
his
custom
he
found
them
both
neatly
dressed
and
looking
bright
and
happy
how
are
you
my
darlings
he
asked
kissing
them
in
turn
then
seating
himself
and
drawing
them
into
his
arms
i
think
we
both
very
well
papa
answered
lulu
yes
indeed
said
grace
and
i
ever
so
glad
of
what
lu
been
telling
me
the
money
you
are
going
to
give
us
if
we
good
and
the
choosing
where
the
other
shall
go
that
you
going
to
give
to
help
send
missionaries
to
the
heathen
thank
you
for
both
dear
papa
but
do
you
think
we
ought
to
be
good
without
being
paid
for
it
yes
i
certainly
do
my
dear
little
girl
but
at
the
same
time
i
want
my
children
to
have
the
luxury
of
being
able
to
give
something
which
they
have
in
some
sense
earned
for
that
purpose
i
want
you
to
learn
in
your
own
experience
the
truth
of
the
words
of
the
lord
jesus
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
now
while
you
are
so
young
not
capable
of
earning
much
in
any
other
way
your
proper
business
the
task
of
gaining
knowledge
and
skill
to
fit
you
for
future
usefulness
i
see
no
more
fitting
way
than
this
for
you
to
be
furnished
with
money
for
religious
and
benevolent
purposes
papa
asked
lulu
do
you
think
it
is
never
right
for
anybody
to
have
diamonds
or
handsome
jewelry
of
any
kind
i
do
not
think
it
my
business
to
judge
in
such
matters
for
everybody
he
answered
caressing
her
and
smiling
down
tenderly
into
her
eyes
but
i
must
judge
for
myself
applying
the
rules
the
bible
gives
me
and
to
a
great
extent
for
my
children
also
while
they
are
so
young
not
for
mamma
vi
lulu
asked
with
some
little
hesitation
no
she
is
my
wife
not
my
child
and
old
enough
to
judge
for
herself
she
has
a
great
deal
of
beautiful
jewelry
remarked
lulu
with
an
involuntary
sigh
and
grandma
elsie
has
still
more
rosie
asked
her
once
to
show
it
to
us
children
and
she
did
oh
she
has
just
the
loveliest
rings
and
whole
sets
of
jewelry
pins
and
to
match
and
chains
and
bracelets
i
sure
they
must
be
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
rosie
said
they
were
and
i
sure
grandma
elsie
is
a
real
true
christian
a
very
very
good
one
and
that
mamma
vi
is
too
and
i
agree
with
you
in
that
was
the
emphatic
reply
but
my
daughter
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
deciding
their
duty
for
them
in
regard
to
this
or
other
things
god
does
not
require
that
of
us
indeed
forbids
it
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
jesus
said
but
i
see
plainly
that
my
duty
is
as
i
explained
it
to
you
last
evening
and
i
thought
then
you
were
convinced
that
it
would
be
selfish
and
wrong
for
you
and
me
to
spend
a
large
sum
for
useless
ornament
that
might
otherwise
be
used
for
the
good
of
our
fellow
creatures
and
the
advancement
of
christ
kingdom
yes
papa
i
was
and
i
trying
and
asking
god
to
help
me
not
to
want
the
ring
i
asked
you
for
but
i
afraid
it
take
me
quite
a
while
to
quite
stop
wishing
for
it
she
sighed
you
will
conquer
at
length
if
you
keep
on
trying
and
asking
for
help
he
said
giving
her
a
tender
kiss
a
good
plan
will
be
to
fill
your
thoughts
with
other
things
he
went
on
your
lessons
while
in
the
after
that
you
may
find
it
pleasant
to
begin
planning
for
christmas
gifts
to
be
made
or
bought
for
those
you
love
and
others
whom
you
would
like
to
help
i
shall
give
each
of
you
including
max
as
much
extra
spending
money
as
i
did
last
year
beside
all
that
for
benevolence
papa
they
asked
in
surprise
and
delight
yes
what
i
provide
you
with
for
benevolence
is
something
aside
from
your
spending
money
which
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
with
as
you
please
within
certain
bounds
he
said
rising
and
taking
a
hand
of
each
as
the
breakfast
bell
sounded
out
its
summons
to
the
morning
meal
misconduct
and
poor
recitations
were
alike
very
rare
in
the
at
woodburn
neither
found
a
place
there
so
that
the
captain
had
only
commendations
to
bestow
and
they
were
heartily
and
gladly
given
the
ice
and
snow
had
entirely
disappeared
and
the
roads
were
muddy
too
muddy
it
was
thought
to
make
travel
over
them
particularly
agreeable
but
the
children
obtained
sufficient
exercise
in
romping
over
the
wide
porches
and
trotting
round
the
grounds
on
their
ponies
but
in
spite
of
the
bad
condition
of
the
roads
the
ion
carriage
drove
over
early
in
the
afternoon
and
grandma
elsie
elsie
leland
her
namesake
daughter
rosie
and
evelyn
alighted
from
it
everybody
was
delighted
to
see
them
and
to
hear
that
they
would
stay
to
tea
o
girls
said
lulu
come
up
to
my
room
and
take
off
your
things
something
to
tell
you
and
she
looked
so
gay
and
happy
that
they
felt
quite
sure
it
was
something
that
pleased
her
greatly
i
think
i
can
guess
what
it
is
laughed
rosie
your
father
has
promised
you
the
diamond
ring
you
want
so
badly
no
it
is
that
you
may
have
another
guess
but
i
do
believe
you
could
hit
the
right
thing
if
you
should
guess
fifty
or
a
hundred
times
then
i
try
i
give
it
up
do
you
eva
yes
please
tell
us
lu
said
evelyn
then
lulu
talking
fast
and
eagerly
repeated
to
them
what
she
had
told
to
grace
in
bed
that
morning
oh
how
nice
evelyn
exclaimed
how
i
should
like
to
be
in
your
place
lu
i
think
it
nice
too
rosie
said
and
i
like
mamma
or
grandpa
to
do
the
same
by
me
but
i
want
my
pearls
too
she
added
laughing
mamma
rich
enough
to
give
me
them
and
do
all
she
need
do
for
missions
and
the
poor
beside
but
so
very
very
much
is
needed
remarked
evelyn
i
read
in
some
of
the
religious
papers
that
if
every
church
member
would
give
but
a
small
sum
yearly
there
would
be
enough
said
rosie
and
mamma
gives
hundreds
and
thousands
of
dollars
and
grandpa
gives
a
great
deal
too
so
i
do
see
that
i
ought
to
do
without
the
set
of
pearls
i
set
my
heart
on
it
is
mamma
place
to
do
other
duty
for
them
in
the
way
of
giving
any
more
than
in
other
things
grandma
elsie
and
her
older
daughters
were
in
violet
boudoir
i
had
letters
this
morning
from
your
brothers
harold
and
herbert
vi
and
have
brought
them
with
me
to
read
to
you
the
mother
said
taking
the
missives
from
her
pocket
thank
you
mamma
i
am
always
glad
to
hear
what
they
write
their
letters
are
never
dull
or
uninteresting
violet
replied
her
sister
elsie
adding
they
are
always
worth
hearing
lester
and
i
think
what
dear
boys
they
are
and
quite
as
highly
appreciated
by
my
husband
as
by
yours
elsie
violet
said
with
a
bright
happy
look
they
are
a
great
blessing
and
comfort
to
their
mother
grandma
elsie
remarked
as
indeed
all
my
children
are
their
letters
always
a
source
of
pleasure
but
these
even
more
so
than
most
for
they
show
that
my
college
boys
are
greatly
stirred
up
on
the
subject
of
missions
at
home
and
abroad
full
of
renewed
zeal
for
the
advancement
of
the
cause
and
kingdom
she
then
read
the
letters
which
gave
abundant
evidence
of
the
correctness
of
her
estimate
of
the
state
of
her
sons
minds
they
were
working
as
teachers
in
a
mission
sunday
school
as
bible
readers
and
tract
distributors
among
the
poor
and
degraded
of
the
city
where
they
were
sojourning
doing
good
to
bodies
as
well
as
souls
their
mother
supplying
them
with
means
for
that
purpose
in
addition
to
what
she
allowed
them
for
also
exerting
an
influence
for
good
among
their
fellow
students
they
told
of
interesting
meetings
held
for
prayer
and
conference
upon
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
renewed
and
higher
consecration
on
the
part
of
many
who
were
already
numbered
among
the
master
followers
and
the
conversion
of
others
who
had
hitherto
cared
for
none
of
these
things
the
reading
of
the
letters
was
followed
by
an
earnest
talk
between
the
mother
and
her
daughters
in
which
violet
told
of
her
husband
plans
for
giving
through
his
children
in
addition
to
what
he
would
give
in
other
ways
what
excellent
ideas
grandma
elsie
exclaimed
her
eyes
shining
with
pleasure
i
shall
adopt
both
with
my
younger
two
children
one
with
all
of
you
which
is
that
last
mamma
asked
violet
sportively
the
letting
each
of
you
select
an
object
for
a
certain
sum
which
i
shall
give
mamma
that
is
very
nice
and
kind
remarked
her
daughter
elsie
but
we
should
give
of
our
own
means
do
you
not
think
so
you
may
do
that
in
addition
her
mother
said
i
have
seven
children
on
earth
eight
counting
zoe
and
one
in
heaven
i
shall
give
a
thousand
dollars
in
the
name
of
each
mamma
i
for
one
fully
appreciate
your
kindness
but
think
you
would
make
a
wiser
choice
of
objects
than
we
said
violet
looking
lovingly
into
her
mother
eyes
i
want
you
to
have
the
pleasure
her
mother
answered
and
i
am
reserving
much
the
larger
part
of
what
i
have
to
give
for
objects
of
my
own
selection
for
it
has
pleased
the
lord
to
trust
me
with
the
stewardship
of
a
good
deal
of
the
gold
and
silver
which
are
his
at
that
moment
the
little
girls
entered
the
room
and
rosie
hurrying
up
to
her
mother
asked
mamma
have
you
heard
has
vi
told
you
what
the
captain
intends
doing
how
he
is
going
to
reward
his
children
for
good
behavior
yes
and
i
shall
do
the
same
by
you
and
walter
that
a
dear
good
mamma
exclaimed
rosie
with
satisfaction
i
thought
you
would
and
i
intend
to
follow
the
captain
lead
in
another
matter
grandma
elsie
went
on
smiling
pleasantly
upon
her
young
daughter
that
is
in
allowing
each
of
my
sons
and
daughters
to
select
some
good
object
for
me
to
give
to
that
nice
too
commented
rosie
i
like
to
be
trusted
in
such
things
as
well
as
others
she
added
laughing
and
i
hope
you
trust
me
with
quite
a
sum
of
money
to
give
or
spend
just
as
i
please
ah
my
darling
you
must
not
forget
that
your
mother
is
only
a
steward
was
the
sweet
toned
response
given
between
a
smile
and
a
sigh
for
grandma
elsie
was
not
free
from
anxiety
about
this
youngest
daughter
who
had
some
serious
faults
and
had
not
yet
entered
the
service
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
evelyn
dear
you
too
as
my
pupil
and
a
sort
of
adopted
daughter
must
share
the
reward
of
good
behavior
she
said
with
a
tenderly
affectionate
look
at
the
fatherless
niece
of
her
evelyn
flushed
with
pleasure
but
more
because
of
the
loving
look
than
the
promise
of
reward
dear
grandma
elsie
how
very
kind
and
good
you
always
are
to
me
she
exclaimed
feelingly
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
of
love
and
gratitude
dear
child
whatever
i
have
done
for
you
has
always
been
both
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
travilla
returned
taking
the
hand
of
the
little
girl
who
was
standing
by
her
side
and
pressing
it
affectionately
in
her
own
well
eva
said
rosie
lightly
you
can
calculate
to
a
cent
what
you
have
for
benevolence
for
you
sure
to
earn
the
quarter
every
day
of
your
life
not
quite
rosie
evelyn
answered
in
her
gentle
refined
tones
i
am
liable
to
fall
as
well
as
others
and
may
astonish
both
you
and
myself
some
day
by
behaving
very
ill
indeed
i
certainly
should
be
astonished
eva
laughed
her
aunt
elsie
i
am
quite
sure
it
would
be
only
under
great
provocation
that
you
would
be
guilty
of
very
bad
behavior
and
equally
certain
that
you
will
never
find
that
at
ion
no
evelyn
said
i
have
never
received
anything
but
the
greatest
kindness
there
and
you
are
so
that
you
would
never
fly
into
a
passion
if
you
were
treated
ever
so
badly
remarked
lulu
with
an
admiring
appreciative
look
at
her
friend
accompanied
by
a
regretful
sigh
over
her
own
infirmity
of
temper
perhaps
my
faults
lie
in
another
direction
and
how
much
credit
do
people
deserve
for
refraining
from
doing
what
they
feel
no
temptation
to
do
said
evelyn
with
an
arch
look
and
smile
directed
toward
lulu
and
those
that
tease
quick
tempered
people
and
make
them
angry
deserve
at
least
half
the
blame
rosie
said
softly
in
lulu
ear
putting
an
arm
affectionately
about
her
as
she
spoke
i
do
mean
to
do
so
ever
again
lu
dear
i
sure
you
do
rosie
returned
lulu
in
the
same
low
key
her
eyes
shining
and
it
ever
so
good
in
you
to
take
part
of
the
blame
of
my
badness
the
visitors
went
away
shortly
after
tea
violet
carried
her
babies
off
to
bed
and
the
older
three
of
the
woodburn
children
were
left
alone
with
their
father
they
clustered
about
him
grace
on
his
knee
lulu
on
one
side
max
on
the
other
while
their
tongues
ran
fast
on
whatever
subject
happened
to
be
uppermost
in
their
thoughts
the
captain
encouraging
them
to
talk
freely
for
he
was
most
desirous
to
have
their
entire
confidence
in
order
that
he
might
be
the
better
able
to
correct
wrong
ideas
and
impressions
inculcate
right
views
and
motives
and
lead
them
to
tread
the
paths
of
rectitude
living
noble
unselfish
lives
serving
god
and
doing
good
to
their
fellow
creatures
sensible
questions
were
sure
to
be
patiently
answered
requests
carefully
considered
and
granted
if
reasonable
and
within
his
power
and
instruction
was
given
in
a
way
to
make
it
interesting
and
agreeable
reproof
if
called
for
administered
in
a
kind
fatherly
manner
that
robbed
it
of
its
sting
they
talked
of
their
sports
their
pets
the
books
they
were
reading
the
coming
holidays
the
enjoyment
they
were
looking
forward
to
at
that
time
and
their
plans
for
helping
to
make
it
a
happy
time
to
others
evidently
they
were
troubled
with
no
doubt
of
their
father
fond
affection
or
of
the
fact
that
he
was
their
best
earthly
friend
and
wisest
counsellor
there
are
so
many
people
i
want
to
give
to
said
lulu
it
will
take
ever
so
much
thinking
to
know
how
to
manage
it
yes
because
of
course
we
want
to
give
things
they
like
to
have
and
that
we
have
money
enough
to
buy
or
time
to
make
said
grace
perhaps
i
can
help
you
with
your
plans
said
their
father
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
make
out
a
list
of
those
to
whom
you
wish
to
give
and
then
decide
what
amount
to
devote
to
each
and
what
sort
of
thing
would
be
likely
to
prove
acceptable
yet
not
cost
more
than
you
have
set
apart
for
its
purchase
oh
what
a
nice
plan
papa
exclaimed
lulu
we
each
make
a
list
we
yes
if
you
choose
max
my
son
you
may
get
out
paper
and
pencils
for
us
and
we
will
set
to
work
at
once
no
time
like
the
present
is
a
good
motto
in
most
cases
max
hastened
to
obey
and
the
lists
were
made
out
amid
a
good
deal
of
pleasant
chat
now
grave
now
gay
we
do
have
to
put
down
all
the
names
papa
do
we
grace
asked
with
an
arch
look
and
smile
up
into
his
face
no
we
will
except
present
company
he
replied
stroking
her
hair
caressingly
and
returning
her
smile
with
one
full
of
tender
fatherly
affection
the
names
were
all
written
down
first
then
came
the
task
of
deciding
upon
the
gifts
we
will
take
your
lists
in
turn
beginning
with
max
and
ending
with
gracie
the
captain
said
that
part
of
the
work
required
no
little
consultation
between
the
three
children
papa
advice
was
asked
in
every
instance
and
almost
always
decided
the
question
but
glancing
over
the
lists
when
completed
i
think
my
dears
you
have
laid
out
too
much
work
for
yourselves
he
said
but
i
thought
you
always
liked
us
to
be
industrious
papa
said
lulu
yes
daughter
but
not
overworked
i
can
not
have
that
nor
can
i
allow
you
to
neglect
your
studies
omit
needed
exercise
or
go
without
sufficient
sleep
to
keep
you
in
health
papa
you
always
make
taking
good
care
of
us
the
first
thing
she
said
gratefully
nestling
closer
to
him
do
you
know
that
what
fathers
are
for
he
said
smiling
down
on
her
my
children
were
given
me
to
be
taken
care
of
provided
for
loved
and
trained
up
aright
a
precious
charge
he
added
looking
from
one
to
another
with
glistening
eyes
yes
sir
i
know
she
said
laying
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
slipping
a
hand
into
his
and
oh
but
i
glad
and
thankful
that
god
gave
me
to
you
instead
of
to
somebody
else
and
gracie
and
i
are
just
as
glad
to
belong
to
papa
as
you
are
said
max
grace
adding
yes
indeed
as
she
held
up
her
face
for
a
kiss
which
her
father
gave
very
heartily
but
papa
what
are
we
to
do
about
the
presents
if
we
must
take
time
to
make
them
asked
lulu
make
fewer
and
buy
more
but
maybe
the
money
wo
hold
out
you
will
have
to
make
it
hold
out
by
choosing
less
expensive
articles
or
giving
fewer
gifts
we
have
to
try
hard
to
earn
the
quarter
for
good
behavior
every
day
lu
said
max
yes
i
mean
to
but
that
wo
help
with
christmas
gifts
it
only
for
benevolence
you
know
but
what
you
give
to
the
poor
simply
because
they
are
poor
and
needy
may
be
considered
benevolence
i
think
said
their
father
oh
may
it
she
exclaimed
i
glad
of
that
papa
i
have
liked
dick
very
much
since
he
chopped
up
the
cradle
i
carved
for
dolls
but
i
believe
i
want
to
give
him
a
christmas
present
it
will
help
me
to
forgive
him
and
like
him
better
but
i
do
know
what
would
please
him
best
something
to
make
a
noise
with
suggested
max
a
drum
or
trumpet
for
instance
he
make
too
much
racket
she
objected
how
would
a
hatchet
do
asked
max
with
waggish
look
and
smile
not
at
all
he
is
fit
to
be
trusted
with
one
returned
lulu
promptly
papa
what
do
you
think
would
be
a
suitable
present
for
him
a
book
with
bright
pictures
and
short
stories
told
very
simply
in
words
of
one
or
two
syllables
dick
is
going
to
school
and
learning
to
read
and
i
think
such
a
gift
would
be
both
enjoyable
and
useful
to
him
yes
that
be
just
the
right
thing
exclaimed
lulu
papa
you
always
do
know
best
about
everything
i
hope
you
stick
to
that
idea
lu
laughed
max
you
seem
to
have
only
just
found
it
out
but
grace
and
i
have
known
it
this
long
while
have
we
gracie
yes
indeed
returned
the
little
sister
and
so
have
i
said
lulu
hanging
her
head
and
blushing
only
sometimes
i
forgotten
it
for
a
while
but
i
hope
i
wo
any
more
dear
papa
she
added
softly
with
a
penitent
beseeching
look
up
into
his
face
i
hope
not
my
darling
he
responded
in
tender
tones
caressing
her
hair
and
cheek
with
his
hand
and
the
past
shall
not
be
laid
up
against
you
papa
will
you
take
us
to
the
city
as
you
did
last
year
and
let
us
choose
ourselves
the
things
we
are
going
to
give
asked
max
i
intend
to
do
so
his
father
said
judging
from
the
length
of
your
lists
i
think
we
will
have
to
take
several
trips
to
accomplish
it
all
so
we
will
make
a
beginning
before
long
when
the
weather
has
become
settled
perhaps
the
first
pleasant
day
of
next
week
if
you
have
all
been
good
and
industrious
about
your
lessons
have
we
earned
our
quarters
papa
asked
grace
i
think
you
are
in
a
fair
way
to
do
so
he
answered
smiling
but
you
still
have
a
chance
to
lose
them
between
this
and
your
bedtime
it
just
before
we
get
into
bed
you
give
them
to
us
papa
lulu
said
inquiringly
i
shall
tell
you
at
that
time
whether
you
have
earned
them
but
i
may
sometimes
only
set
the
amount
down
to
your
credit
and
pay
you
the
money
in
a
lump
at
the
end
of
the
week
yes
sir
we
like
that
way
just
as
well
they
returned
in
chorus
violet
had
come
in
and
taken
possession
of
an
easy
chair
on
the
farther
side
of
the
glowing
grate
looking
smilingly
at
the
little
group
opposite
i
have
a
thought
she
said
lightly
who
can
guess
it
it
something
nice
about
papa
how
handsome
he
is
and
how
good
and
kind
ventured
lulu
a
very
close
guess
lu
laughed
violet
for
my
thought
was
that
the
woodburn
children
have
as
good
and
kind
a
father
as
could
be
found
in
all
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
we
know
it
mamma
vi
we
all
think
so
cried
the
children
but
the
captain
shook
his
head
saying
ah
my
dear
flattery
is
not
good
for
me
if
you
continue
to
dose
me
with
it
who
knows
but
i
shall
become
as
conceited
and
vain
as
a
peacock
not
a
bit
of
danger
of
that
she
returned
gaily
but
i
do
not
consider
the
truth
flattery
suppose
we
change
the
subject
he
said
with
a
smile
we
have
been
making
out
lists
of
christmas
gifts
and
would
like
to
have
your
opinion
and
advice
in
regard
to
some
of
them
you
shall
have
them
for
what
they
are
worth
she
returned
taking
the
slips
of
paper
max
handed
her
and
glancing
over
them
chapter
iv
the
parlor
at
ion
full
of
light
and
warmth
looked
very
pleasant
and
inviting
this
evening
the
whole
family
not
so
large
now
as
it
had
been
before
capt
raymond
took
his
wife
and
children

breaking
a
pause
in
the
conversation
do
you
know
has
mamma
told
you
about
her
new
plans
for
benevolence
how
she
is
going
to
let
us
all
help
her
in
distributing
her
funds
us
echoed
zoe
inquiringly
yes
all
her
children
and
that
includes
you
of
course
most
assuredly
it
does
said
grandma
elsie
smiling
tenderly
upon
her
young
zoe
eyes
sparkled
thank
you
mamma
she
said
with
feeling
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
left
out
of
the
number
i
am
very
proud
of
belonging
there
but
what
about
the
new
plans
rosie
if
mamma
is
willing
you
should
tell
me
now
what
they
are
quite
willing
responded
mamma
and
rosie
went
on
you
know
mamma
always
gives
thousands
of
dollars
every
year
to
home
and
foreign
missions
and
other
good
causes
and
she
says
that
this
time
she
will
let
each
of
us
choose
a
cause
for
her
to
give
a
thousand
to
i
like
that
exclaimed
zoe
many
thanks
mamma
for
my
share
of
the
privilege
i
shall
choose
to
have
my
thousand
go
to
help
the
mission
schools
in
utah
i
feel
so
sorry
for
those
poor
mormon
women
the
idea
of
having
to
share
your
husband
with
another
woman
or
maybe
half
a
dozen
or
more
it
simply
awful
yes
and
that
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
wickedness
mormonism
is
responsible
for
remarked
grandma
rose
think
of
the
tyranny
of
their
priesthood
interfering
with
the
liberty
of
the
people
in
every
possible
way
claiming
the
right
to
dictate
as
to
what
they
shall
read
where
they
shall
send
their
children
to
school
with
whom
they
shall
trade
where
they
shall
live
or
ordering
them
to
break
up
their
homes
make
a
forced
sale
of
their
property
and
move
into
another
state
or
territory
at
their
own
cost
or
go
on
a
mission
their
wicked
doctrine
and
practice
of
what
they
call
blood
atonement
too
sighed
grandma
elsie
and
the
bitter
hatred
they
inculcate
toward
the
people
and
government
of
these
united
states
added
zoe
oh
i
am
sure
both
love
of
country
and
desire
for
the
advancement
of
christ
cause
and
kingdom
should
lead
us
to
do
all
we
can
to
rescue
utah
from
mormonism
do
you
not
think
so
mamma
i
entirely
agree
with
you
and
am
well
satisfied
with
your
choice
grandma
elsie
replied
perhaps
i
shall
choose
for
mine
to
go
there
too
said
rosie
but
i
believe
i
take
a
little
more
time
to
consider
the
claims
of
other
causes
walter
closed
his
book
and
came
to
his
mother
side
am
i
to
have
a
share
in
it
mamma
he
asked
in
selecting
an
object
for
me
to
give
to
yes
my
son
a
thousand
dollars
yes
oh
that
good
i
think
i
adopt
an
indian
boy
clothe
and
educate
him
adopt
laughed
rosie
a
boy
of
ten
talking
about
adopting
somebody
else
not
to
be
a
father
to
him
rosie
except
in
the
way
of
providing
for
him
as
fathers
do
for
their
children
mamma
knows
what
i
mean
yes
my
boy
i
do
and
highly
approve
as
a
nation
we
have
robbed
the
poor
indians
and
owe
them
a
debt
that
i
fear
will
never
be
paid
i
mean
to
do
my
share
toward
paying
it
if
i
live
to
be
a
man
walter
said
and
i
like
to
begin
now
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
my
son
responded
his
mother
would
you
prefer
to
have
all
your
thousands
go
to
pay
that
debt
mamma
asked
rosie
no
child
not
all
as
i
have
said
i
highly
approve
of
zoe
choice
and
i
would
send
the
gospel
tidings
into
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
to
the
millions
who
have
never
heard
the
name
of
jesus
and
there
is
another
race
to
whom
we
owe
reparation
remarked
dinsmore
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
regarding
the
with
a
half
rueful
look
there
ned
my
boy
i
think
you
would
have
come
off
victor
if
my
attention
had
not
been
called
from
the
game
by
the
talk
of
the
ladies
never
mind
grandpa
we
take
all
the
blame
laughed
rosie
jumping
up
to
run
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
give
him
a
kiss
he
returned
it
drew
her
to
his
knee
and
went
on
with
his
remarks
you
all
know
of
course
that
i
refer
to
the
negroes
who
were
forcibly
torn
from
their
own
land
and
enslaved
in
this
we
must
educate
and
evangelize
them
as
a
debt
we
owe
them
and
also
for
the
salvation
of
our
country
whose
liberties
will
be
greatly
imperilled
by
their
presence
and
possession
of
the
elective
franchise
if
they
are
left
to
ignorance
and
vice
grandpa
what
do
you
mean
by
the
elective
franchise
asked
walter
going
to
the
side
of
the
old
gentleman
chair
the
right
to
vote
at
elections
my
son
you
can
see
ca
you
what
harm
might
come
from
it
yes
sir
they
might
help
to
put
bad
men
into
office
some
of
themselves
maybe
and
bad
men
would
be
likely
to
make
bad
laws
and
favor
rogues
oh
yes
sir
i
understand
it
then
perhaps
you
may
want
to
help
provide
for
the
instruction
of
the
colored
race
as
well
as
of
the
indians
yes
sir
i
would
like
to
i
hope
the
thousand
dollars
may
be
enough
to
help
the
work
for
both
i
think
it
will
that
your
mother
will
be
satisfied
to
have
you
divide
it
into
two
or
more
portions
that
several
good
objects
may
receive
some
aid
from
it
will
you
mamma
asked
walter
turning
to
her
yes
i
think
it
would
perhaps
be
the
wisest
way
and
besides
said
rosie
mamma
is
going
to
give
us
young
ones
a
chance
to
earn
money
for
benevolence
by
paying
us
for
good
behavior
i
know
we
ought
to
be
good
without
other
reward
than
that
of
a
good
conscience
but
i
quite
delighted
with
the
plan
for
all
that
i
too
said
walter
looking
greatly
pleased
thank
you
mamma
dear
how
much
is
it
you
going
to
give
us
cents
for
every
day
on
which
i
have
no
occasion
to
find
fault
with
either
your
conduct
or
recitations
a
new
idea
daughter
is
it
queried
dinsmore
yes
sir
and
not
original
i
learned
at
woodburn
that
the
captain
was
going
to
try
the
plan
with
his
children
i
trust
it
meets
your
approval
i
might
better
have
consulted
with
you
before
announcing
my
intention
to
adopt
it
that
was
not
at
all
necessary
he
returned
pleasantly
but
i
quite
approve
and
trust
you
will
find
it
work
to
your
entire
satisfaction
talking
of
helping
the
blacks
and
thinking
of
the
advice
so
often
given
the
work
nearest
at
hand
it
strikes
me
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
begin
with
those
in
our
own
house
and
on
the
plantation
remarked
edward
i
think
they
have
never
been
neglected
edward
said
his
grandfather
a
was
provided
for
them
years
ago
your
mother
pays
a
teacher
to
instruct
them
visits
the
school
frequently
often
gives
religious
instruction
herself
to
the
pupils
there
and
to
their
parents
in
visiting
them
in
their
cabins
sees
that
they
are
taken
care
of
in
sickness
too
and
that
they
do
not
suffer
for
the
necessaries
of
life
at
any
time
yes
sir
that
is
all
true
returned
edward
but
i
was
only
thinking
of
giving
them
some
extra
care
instruction
and
gifts
during
the
approaching
holidays
says
a
christmas
tree
loaded
with
not
the
substantials
of
life
only
but
some
of
the
things
that
will
give
pleasure
merely
finery
for
the
women
and
girls
toys
for
the
children
and
so
forth
meaning
tobacco
for
the
old
folks
and
sweets
for
all
i
suppose
added
zoe
with
sportive
look
and
tone
yes
my
dear
that
about
it
he
said
smiling
affectionately
upon
her
o
mamma
let
us
do
it
cried
rosie
with
enthusiasm
let
have
a
fine
big
tree
in
their
and
have
them
come
there
and
get
their
gifts
before
we
have
ours
here
we
should
get
vi
and
the
captain
to
join
us
in
it
as
the
colored
children
from
woodburn
attend
school
there
too
i
am
well
pleased
with
the
idea
replied
her
mother
and
have
little
doubt
that
the
captain
and
vi
will
be
also
but
let
us
have
your
opinion
my
dear
father
she
added
turning
upon
him
a
look
of
mingled
love
and
reverence
it
coincides
with
yours
daughter
dinsmore
answered
and
i
move
that
ned
and
zoe
be
appointed
a
committee
to
find
out
the
needs
of
the
proposed
recipients
of
our
bounty
others
being
permitted
to
assist
if
they
like
the
motion
was
carried
by
acclamation
merry
jesting
and
laughter
followed
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
visitor
announced
lilburn
ladies
and
gentlemen
grandma
elsie
hastily
laid
aside
her
crocheting
and
hurried
forward
with
both
hands
extended
cousin
ronald
what
a
joyful
surprise
welcome
welcome
to
ion
thanks
a
thousand
thanks
my
fair
kinswoman
my
bonny
leddy
my
sweet
cousin
elsie
returned
the
old
gentleman
taking
the
offered
hands
in
his
and
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
the
still
round
and
blooming
cheek
i
have
ventured
to
come
without
previous
announcement
o
my
intention
or
query
about
the
inconvenience
i
might
cause
in
your
household
arrangements
or
no
fear
of
that
sir
dinsmore
interrupted
offering
his
hand
in
return
i
know
that
you
are
and
always
will
be
a
most
welcome
guest
in
my
daughter
house
you
have
given
us
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
the
fault
will
not
be
ours
if
we
do
not
keep
you
all
winter
the
others
from
dinsmore
down
to
walter
followed
suit
with
greetings
no
less
joyous
and
cordial
for
the
old
gentleman
was
a
great
favorite
at
ion
and
with
the
whole
connection
he
was
presently
installed
in
the
easiest
chair
in
the
warmest
corner
and
hospitably
urged
to
take
some
refreshment
but
he
declined
saying
he
had
had
his
supper
in
the
village
before
driving
over
and
wanted
nothing
more
till
morning
then
he
went
on
to
account
for
his
sudden
appearance
he
had
been
sojourning
some
hundreds
of
miles
farther
north
had
not
been
well
and
his
physician
advising
an
immediate
change
to
a
more
southerly
climate
he
had
set
out
at
once
for
ion
without
waiting
to
let
them
know
of
his
intentions
feeling
sure
of
just
such
a
welcome
as
he
had
received
and
a
month
warning
could
not
have
made
you
more
welcome
than
you
are
cousin
said
his
hostess
the
conversation
broken
in
upon
by
lilburn
arrival
was
not
renewed
that
evening
but
the
subject
was
introduced
again
the
next
morning
at
the
breakfast
table
and
some
questions
in
regard
to
it
were
decided
all
could
not
be
however
without
consultation
with
the
captain
and
violet
and
with
lester
and
elsie
leland
both
families
were
speedily
informed
through
the
telephone
of
the
arrival
of
lilburn
and
that
afternoon
saw
them
all
gathered
at
ion
again
to
do
him
honor
and
to
complete
their
arrangements
for
the
holiday
festivities
during
the
intervening
weeks
there
was
a
great
deal
of
traveling
back
and
forth
between
the
three
houses
and
to
and
from
the
city
for
their
plans
involved
a
good
deal
of
shopping
on
the
part
of
both
the
older
people
and
the
children
the
latter
were
so
full
of
pleasureable
excitement
that
at
times
they
found
no
little
difficulty
in
giving
proper
attention
to
their
studies
such
was
especially
the
case
with
rosie
and
lulu
but
both
grandma
elsie
and
capt
raymond
were
quite
firm
though
in
a
kind
and
gentle
way
in
requiring
tasks
to
be
well
learned
before
permission
was
given
to
lay
them
aside
for
more
congenial
employment
rosie
besought
her
mother
very
urgently
for
permission
to
sit
up
for
an
hour
beyond
her
usual
bedtime
in
order
to
make
greater
progress
with
her
fancy
work
for
christmas
but
it
was
not
granted
no
my
dear
little
daughter
elsie
said
you
need
your
usual
amount
of
sleep
to
keep
you
in
health
and
i
can
not
have
you
deprived
of
it
but
mamma
returned
rosie
a
little
impatiently
i
sure
it
could
do
me
any
great
amount
of
damage
to
try
it
a
few
times
and
i
really
think
you
might
allow
me
to
do
so
my
daughter
must
try
to
believe
that
her
mother
knows
best
was
the
grave
though
gently
spoken
rejoinder
i
think
it
is
a
little
hard
mamma
pouted
rosie
i
almost
grown
up
and
it
so
pleasant
in
the
parlor
where
you
are
all
talking
together
especially
now
that
cousin
ronald
is
here
that
it
does
seem
too
bad
to
have
to
run
away
from
it
all
an
hour
before
you
older
folks
separate
for
the
night
i
feel
it
hard
even
if
i
was
wanting
more
time
for
my
fancy
work
for
christmas
a
little
girl
with
so
foolish
and
unkind
a
mother
as
yours
is
certainly
much
to
be
pitied
travilla
remarked
in
reply
mamma
i
did
not
mean
that
i
could
never
think
or
speak
of
you
in
that
way
returned
rosie
blushing
vividly
and
hanging
her
head
if
you
had
overheard
lulu
addressing
the
remarks
to
her
father
that
you
have
just
made
to
me
would
you
have
taken
them
as
evidence
of
her
confidence
in
his
wisdom
and
love
for
her
asked
her
mother
and
rosie
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
she
would
not
please
forgive
me
mamma
dear
she
said
penitently
i
not
talk
so
again
i
have
earned
my
quarter
for
good
behavior
i
quite
aware
of
that
no
my
child
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
say
you
have
not
sighed
her
mother
it
was
one
afternoon
in
the
second
week
after
lilburn
arrival
that
this
conversation
between
rosie
and
her
mother
was
held
at
the
same
hour
max
and
lulu
were
in
their
at
home
busily
carving
since
their
dismissal
from
that
morning
tasks
they
had
spent
every
moment
of
time
at
that
work
except
what
had
necessarily
been
given
to
the
eating
of
their
dinner
presently
their
father
came
in
you
are
very
industrious
my
darlings
he
said
in
a
pleasant
tone
but
how
much
exercise
have
you
taken
in
the
open
air
not
any
yet
papa
answered
max
then
it
must
be
attended
to
at
once
by
both
of
you
o
papa
let
me
keep
on
at
this
just
a
little
longer
pleaded
lulu
no
daughter
not
another
minute
these
winter
days
are
short
the
sun
will
boon
set
and
outdoor
exercise
will
not
do
you
half
so
much
good
after
sundown
as
before
put
on
your
hats
and
coats
and
we
will
have
a
brisk
walk
together
the
roads
are
quite
dry
now
and
i
think
we
will
find
it
enjoyable
the
cloud
that
had
begun
to
gather
on
lulu
brow
at
the
refusal
of
her
request
vanished
with
the
words
of
invitation
to
walk
with
papa
for
to
do
so
was
one
of
her
dear
delights
both
she
and
max
obeyed
the
order
with
cheerful
alacrity
and
presently
the
three
sallied
forth
together
to
return
in
time
for
tea
in
good
spirits
and
with
fine
appetites
for
their
meal
the
children
rosy
and
merry
violet
was
teaching
lulu
to
crochet
and
the
little
girl
had
become
much
interested
in
her
work
when
the
hour
for
bedtime
came
she
did
not
want
to
give
it
up
and
like
rosie
begged
for
permission
to
stay
up
for
another
hour
no
dear
child
her
father
said
it
is
quite
important
that
little
ones
like
you
should
keep
to
regular
hours
early
hours
too
for
going
to
rest
then
may
i
get
up
sooner
in
the
mornings
while
i
so
busy
she
asked
coaxingly
if
you
find
yourself
unable
to
sleep
not
otherwise
my
little
health
is
of
far
more
importance
than
the
making
of
the
most
beautiful
christmas
gifts
he
added
with
a
tender
caress
and
i
forget
this
time
that
papa
knows
best
she
said
in
a
cheery
tone
giving
him
a
hug
he
returned
it
i
think
is
likely
to
be
a
pleasant
day
he
said
and
if
so
i
hope
to
take
my
wife
and
children
to
the
city
for
some
more
of
the
shopping
you
all
seem
to
find
so
necessary
and
delightful
just
now
your
aunt
elsie
and
evelyn
are
going
too
so
that
you
can
probably
have
your
friend
help
in
selecting
the
articles
you
wish
to
buy
oh
how
delightful
she
exclaimed
i
ought
to
be
a
good
girl
with
such
a
kind
father
always
planning
something
to
give
me
pleasure
you
enjoy
such
expeditions
do
you
lu
queried
violet
yes
indeed
mamma
vi
and
i
hope
papa
will
take
me
several
times
i
want
to
select
my
gift
for
rosie
with
eva
to
help
me
and
like
rosie
to
go
with
me
another
time
to
help
me
choose
one
for
evelyn
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
gratify
you
in
that
and
to
give
you
more
time
for
christmas
work
i
will
release
you
from
the
task
of
taking
care
of
your
own
rooms
till
after
the
holidays
and
have
them
attended
to
by
one
of
the
servants
said
the
captain
but
now
bid
good
night
and
go
to
your
bed
oh
thank
you
dear
papa
she
cried
joyously
and
obeyed
at
once
without
a
murmur
the
weather
next
day
was
favorable
and
the
shopping
a
decided
success
the
ladies
and
little
girls
returned
somewhat
weary
with
their
exertions
but
in
fine
spirits
lulu
feeling
particularly
happy
over
a
present
for
rosie
which
every
one
thought
was
sure
to
be
acceptable
a
few
days
later
her
father
took
her
and
rosie
together
evelyn
being
left
out
of
the
party
in
order
that
her
present
might
be
selected
without
her
knowledge
indeed
in
the
afternoon
of
every
pleasant
day
from
that
to
the
one
before
christmas
the
woodburn
carriage
might
have
been
seen
driving
to
and
from
the
city
and
on
almost
every
occasion
lulu
was
one
of
its
occupants
but
on
the
twenty
third
she
preferred
to
stay
behind
so
much
that
she
wanted
a
share
in
was
going
on
at
or
near
home
first
the
trimmings
with
evergreens
of
several
rooms
in
the
mansion
then
of
the
for
the
poor
whites
of
the
neighborhood
which
capt
raymond
had
caused
to
be
built
on
a
corner
of
his
estate
paying
a
teacher
that
the
children
might
be
instructed
without
cost
to
their
parents
a
fine
large
christmas
tree
was
set
up
in
it
another
in
the
for
the
blacks
at
ion
the
colored
people
employed
on
the
fairview
estate
attended
there
also
and
were
to
have
a
share
in
the
entertainment
provided
for
those
of
woodburn
and
ion
so
the
children
of
the
three
families
united
in
the
work
of
ornamenting
first
one
building
then
the
other
finding
it
great
sport
and
flattering
themselves
that
they
were
of
great
assistance
though
the
older
people
who
were
overseeing
matters
and
the
servants
acting
under
their
direction
were
perhaps
of
a
different
opinion
yet
the
sight
of
the
enjoyment
of
the
little
folks
more
than
atoned
for
the
slight
inconvenience
of
having
them
about
christmas
came
on
wednesday
and
the
holidays
had
begun
for
them
all
the
friday
before
lessons
would
not
be
taken
up
again
till
after
new
day
it
had
been
decided
at
woodburn
that
they
would
not
go
to
ion
till
christmas
morning
as
they
all
preferred
to
celebrate
christmas
eve
at
home
the
children
were
going
to
hang
up
their
stockings
but
had
not
been
told
that
they
would
have
a
tree
or
any
gifts
they
thought
and
had
said
to
each
other
that
perhaps
papa
might
think
the
money
he
had
given
them
to
spend
and
to
give
and
the
privilege
of
selecting
objects
for
his
benevolence
was
enough
from
him
but
the
friends
at
ion
and
fairview
always
had
remembered
them
and
most
likely
would
do
so
again
still
they
may
not
lulu
added
with
a
slight
sigh
when
she
talked
the
matter
over
with
max
and
grace
that
morning
for
the
last
time
for
they
are
all
giving
more
than
usual
to
missions
and
disabled
ministers
and
poor
folks
and
i
do
know
what
else
but
it
real
fun
to
give
to
the
poor
round
here
i
mean
it
will
be
to
help
put
things
on
the
trees
and
then
see
how
pleased
they
all
be
when
they
get
at
least
i
do
suppose
they
will
do
you
may
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
they
not
he
assented
though
i
begin
to
find
out
that
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
and
yet
for
all
that
if
i
get
some
nice
presents
or
i
be
at
all
sorry
he
added
with
a
laugh
max
said
lulu
reflectively
you
knew
about
the
christmas
tree
beforehand
last
year
has
papa
told
you
whether
we
to
have
one
this
time
or
not
no
not
a
word
and
as
he
tells
me
almost
always
what
he
intends
to
have
done
about
the
place
the
boy
went
on
with
a
look
of
pride
in
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
i
afraid
it
pretty
good
evidence
that
we
not
to
have
one
for
a
moment
grace
looked
sorely
disappointed
then
brightening
but
i
most
sure
she
said
that
papa
and
mamma
wo
let
us
go
without
any
presents
at
all
they
love
us
a
great
deal
and
will
be
sure
to
remember
us
with
a
little
bit
of
something
anyway
it
nice
that
we
have
something
for
them
remarked
lulu
cheerily
papa
helped
us
choose
mamma
vi
and
she
advised
us
what
to
make
for
papa
so
i
pretty
sure
they
both
be
pleased
it
was
while
waiting
for
their
father
to
take
them
to
the
that
they
had
this
talk
and
it
was
brought
to
a
conclusion
by
his
voice
summoning
them
to
get
into
the
carriage
there
is
no
time
to
lose
my
darlings
he
said
for
it
is
likely
to
take
about
all
the
morning
to
trim
the
two
rooms
and
two
trees
chapter
grandma
elsie
college
boys
harold
and
herbert
travilla
had
come
home
for
the
holidays
arriving
the
latter
part
of
the
previous
week
this
morning
they
had
come
over
to
woodburn
very
soon
after
breakfast
to
have
a
chat
with
vi
while
they
could
catch
her
alone
they
said
for
with
all
the
company
that
was
to
be
entertained
at
ion
they
might
not
have
so
good
a
chance
again
they
stood
with
her
at
the
window
watching
the
carriage
as
it
drove
away
with
the
captain
and
his
children
it
had
hardly
reached
the
gate
leading
into
the
high
road
when
harold
turned
to
his
sister
with
the
remark
well
vi
we
had
quite
a
satisfactory
talk
and
now
for
action
as
i
overheard
the
captain
say
to
the
children
no
time
to
lose
no
we
will
begin
at
once
returned
violet
leading
the
way
to
the
large
room
where
the
christmas
tree
had
been
set
up
last
year
a
couple
of
negro
men
were
carrying
in
its
counterpart
at
one
door
as
violet
and
her
brother
entered
at
the
other
ah
that
a
fine
tree
jack
she
said
addressing
one
of
them
the
captain
selected
it
i
suppose
yes
miss
de
done
say
dis
hyar
one
was
for
de
woodburn
chillen
an
we
to
watch
an
fotch
in
soon
dey
clar
gone
out
ob
sight
yes
she
said
we
want
to
give
them
a
pleasant
surprise
i
think
they
are
doubtful
as
to
whether
their
father
intends
that
they
shall
have
a
tree
this
year
she
added
aside
to
her
brothers
then
the
surprise
will
be
the
greater
harold
returned
and
it
is
half
the
fun
i
supposed
they
were
pretty
certain
of
the
tree
and
would
be
surprised
only
by
the
nature
of
the
gifts
they
will
have
a
goodly
supply
of
those
violet
said
with
a
pleased
look
glancing
in
the
direction
of
a
table
heaped
with
packages
of
various
sizes
and
shapes
do
you
know
boys
when
christmas
times
come
round
i
always
feel
glad
i
married
a
man
with
children
it
such
a
dear
delight
to
lay
plans
for
their
enjoyment
and
to
carry
them
out
just
like
you
vi
said
herbert
and
i
like
to
hear
you
talk
in
that
way
but
you
have
your
own
two
yes
but
even
elsie
is
hardly
old
enough
yet
to
care
very
much
for
such
things
the
tree
was
now
in
place
and
the
work
of
trimming
it
began
it
very
good
in
you
boys
to
come
here
and
help
me
instead
of
joining
in
the
fun
they
are
doubtless
having
at
the
remarked
violet
as
she
handed
a
glittering
fairy
to
harold
who
was
mounted
upon
a
alongside
of
the
tree
there
i
think
that
will
look
well
perched
on
that
topmost
bough
our
tastes
agree
he
said
fastening
the
fairy
in
the
designated
spot
yes
i
think
herbie
and
i
are
entitled
to
any
amount
of
gratitude
on
your
part
for
the
great
we
are
practicing
and
the
wonderful
exertions
we
shall
put
forth
in
carrying
out
your
wishes
and
directions
in
regard
to
this
difficult
and
irksome
business
and
the
fine
phrases
and
well
turned
periods
contained
in
the
remarks
bestowed
upon
your
unsophisticated
country
sister
laughed
violet
of
course
they
must
not
be
forgotten
in
the
reckoning
up
of
your
causes
for
gratitude
ah
vi
how
my
heart
goes
out
in
pity
and
sympathy
for
you
when
i
reflect
that
you
not
only
never
have
shared
in
the
inestimable
privileges
and
delights
of
college
boy
life
but
are
in
the
very
nature
of
things
forever
debarred
from
participation
in
them
i
entirely
appreciate
your
feelings
on
the
subject
she
said
with
mock
gravity
but
would
advise
that
for
the
present
you
forget
them
and
give
your
undivided
attention
to
the
business
in
hand
that
second
fairy
does
not
maintain
a
very
graceful
attitude
true
enough
he
said
promptly
altering
its
position
there
that
for
high
is
it
possible
i
hear
such
slang
from
the
educated
tongue
of
a
college
boy
she
exclaimed
with
a
gesture
of
astonishment
and
dismay
she
high
enough
said
herbert
gazing
scrutinizingly
at
the
fairy
but
there
better
be
more
work
and
less
talk
if
we
are
to
get
through
before
the
captain
and
his
party
come
home
herbert
when
raymond
and
i
have
reached
your
venerable
age
you
may
expect
to
find
us
as
sedate
and
industrious
as
you
are
now
remarked
harold
proceeding
to
hang
upon
the
tree
various
ornaments
as
herbert
handed
them
to
him
and
in
harold
case
due
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
exuberance
of
spirits
of
a
boy
just
let
out
of
school
added
violet
and
in
your
case
my
dear
madam
for
what
a
youthful
flow
of
spirits
consequent
upon
a
temporary
release
from
the
heavy
responsibilities
of
wifehood
and
motherhood
very
temporary
laughed
violet
my
husband
will
be
here
again
in
a
few
hours
and
the
call
to
attend
to
my
babies
may
come
at
any
moment
i
daresay
if
the
captain
had
consulted
only
his
own
inclination
he
would
be
here
now
overseeing
this
job
remarked
harold
half
interrogatively
yes
replied
violet
but
he
thought
his
duty
called
him
to
the
other
places
and
i
think
my
good
husband
never
fails
to
go
where
duty
calls
we
talked
it
over
and
concluded
that
the
best
plan
we
could
hit
upon
was
for
me
to
stay
at
home
and
see
to
this
work
while
he
should
take
his
children
and
assist
at
the
decoration
of
the
to
secure
you
an
opportunity
to
prepare
a
pleasant
surprise
for
them
supplemented
harold
their
work
was
finished
its
results
surveyed
with
satisfaction
and
the
door
of
the
room
closed
and
locked
upon
it
before
the
return
of
the
carriage
bringing
capt
raymond
and
his
merry
happy
little
flock
dinner
filled
up
the
greater
part
of
the
interval
between
their
and
return
to
the
on
the
corner
of
the
estate
to
witness
the
distribution
of
gifts
to
the
poor
whites
of
the
neighborhood
and
by
a
little
management
on
the
part
of
their
father
violet
and
her
brothers
they
were
kept
from
the
vicinity
of
the
room
where
the
christmas
tree
stood
and
got
no
hint
of
its
existence
their
thoughts
were
full
of
the
doings
of
the
morning
and
the
coming
events
of
the
afternoon
and
their
tongues
ran
fast
on
the
two
subjects
their
father
had
to
remind
them
once
or
twice
that
older
people
must
be
allowed
a
chance
to
talk
as
well
as
themselves
but
his
tone
was
not
stern
and
the
slight
reproof
though
sufficient
to
produce
the
desired
effect
threw
no
damper
upon
their
youthful
spirits
they
were
in
the
carriage
again
soon
after
leaving
the
table
violet
with
them
this
time
harold
and
herbert
riding
on
horseback
alongside
of
the
vehicle
for
they
desired
a
share
in
witnessing
the
bestowal
of
the
gifts
they
found
teacher
and
pupils
there
before
them
every
face
bright
with
pleasurable
anticipation
the
jones
children
whose
mother
had
died
the
year
before
and
who
had
continued
to
find
a
good
friend
in
capt
raymond
were
among
the
number
grandma
elsie
zoe
rosie
walter
and
evelyn
leland
arrived
in
a
body
soon
after
the
woodburn
family
and
then
the
exercises
began
the
captain
offered
a
short
prayer
and
made
a
little
address
appropriate
to
the
occasion
teacher
and
scholars
sang
a
hymn
a
christmas
carol
then
the
tree
was
unveiled
amid
murmurs
of
admiration
and
delight
and
the
distribution
of
the
gifts
began
every
child
received
a
suit
of
warm
comfortable
clothes
a
book
a
bag
of
candy
a
sandwich
or
two
some
cakes
and
fruit
the
tree
was
hung
with
apples
oranges
bananas
bunches
of
grapes
and
strings
of
popcorn
there
were
bright
tinsel
ornaments
too
and
a
goodly
array
of
gaily
dressed
paper
dolls
mostly
contribution
she
had
given
up
all
her
store
for
the
gratification
of
the
poor
children
i
had
such
good
times
myself
playing
with
them
and
dressing
them
that
i
do
believe
the
poor
children
that
do
have
half
the
pleasures
i
do
will
enjoy
them
too
and
i
can
do
very
well
without
she
said
to
lulu
on
deciding
to
make
the
sacrifice
so
she
told
her
father
they
were
not
to
be
used
merely
as
a
temporary
ornament
for
the
tree
but
to
be
given
away
to
some
of
the
younger
girls
attending
the
school
they
along
with
other
pretty
things
were
taken
from
the
tree
and
presented
last
of
all
and
the
delight
manifested
by
the
recipients
more
than
made
amends
to
gracie
for
her
from
the
woodburn
our
friends
all
repaired
to
the
one
at
ion
and
a
similar
scene
was
enacted
there
the
exercises
and
the
gifts
to
the
children
were
very
nearly
the
same
but
there
were
older
people
house
servants
and
laborers
on
the
estates
to
whom
were
given
more
substantial
gifts
in
money
and
provisions
for
the
support
of
their
families
the
afternoon
was
waning
when
the
raymonds
again
entered
their
family
carriage
and
the
captain
gave
the
order
home
to
woodburn
and
now
the
children
began
to
think
of
the
home
celebration
of
christmas
eve
and
to
renew
their
wonderings
as
to
what
arrangements
might
have
been
made
for
their
own
enjoyment
of
its
return
still
they
asked
no
question
on
the
subject
but
they
sobered
down
and
were
very
quiet
during
the
short
drive
tired
children
queried
their
father
putting
an
arm
round
grace
as
she
leaned
confidingly
up
against
him
and
smiling
affectionately
upon
them
all
oh
no
sir
not
at
all
replied
max
quickly
straightening
himself
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
no
thought
of
fatigue
not
at
all
papa
echoed
lulu
only
just
a
little
bit
papa
grace
said
with
cheerful
look
and
tone
we
have
had
such
a
nice
day
giving
pleasure
to
others
he
remarked
patting
the
rosy
cheek
resting
against
his
shoulder
there
is
nothing
more
enjoyable
the
little
girls
were
very
glad
to
get
your

following
their
father
and
violet
into
the
house
a
newfoundland
dog

magnificent
specimen
of

way
as
he
spoke
everybody

following
howdy
do
where

called
out
a
rather
harsh
voice
and
sending
a
surprised
inquiring
glance
about

of
the
speaker
the
children
presently

cage
with
a
parrot
in

african
parrot

delighted
face
of
his
eldest
daughter
o
papa

rather
troublesome
pet

added
pointing
to
a
beautiful
maltese
kitten

upon
the
rug
before

big
gift
swallow
your

grace
loved
kittens
and
was
no
less
delighted
with
her
present
than
her
brother
and
sister
with
theirs
o
the
pretty
pet
she
exclaimed
dropping
down
on
the
rug
beside
it
and
gently
stroking
its
soft
fur
i

lap

i
wo

my
little
girl
thoughtful
of
the
comfort
of
even
a
cat
her
father
said
bending
down
to
stroke
gracie
hair
with
tenderly
caressing
hand
i
they

very
kind
to
this
pretty
pussy
and
oh

so

his
reply
was
prevented
by
a
sudden
loud
bark
from
the
dog
as
he
spied
pussy
on
the
rug
turn
him
out
into
the
hall
may
the
captain
said
hastily

in
between

alarmed
for
your
pet
gracie
he
shall
not
be
permitted
to
harm
her
nor

he
papa
asked
lulu
who

trying
to
make
acquaintance
with
her
new
possession
no

not
but
take
care
of
your
fingers
daughter
she
may
snap
at
them
and
give
you
a
bite
that
you
will
remember
for
a
long
while

and
get
yourselves
ready
for
tea
it
is
almost
time
for
the
bell
to
ring
the
children
made
haste
to
obey
the
captain
and
violet
lingered
behind
for
a
moment
how
pleased
they
are
she
said
with
a
joyous
look
up
into
her
husband
face
it
a
perfect
treat
to
witness
their
delight
on
such
occasions
i
can
hardly
wait
to
show
them
the
tree
with
all
its
treasures
dear
wife
your
affection
for
my
darlings
is
a
of
joy
to
me
he
said
with
tender
look
and
smile
and
theirs
for
you
no
less
so
i
am
sure
you
have
completely
won
their
hearts

make
me
very
happy
she
responded
her
eyes
shining
with
joy
and
love
but
there
do
you
hear
little
elsie
calling
for
papa
and
mamma
the
faces
that
surrounded
the
tea
table
that
evening
were
very
bright
though
the
children
had
no
expectation
of
the
treat
in
store
for
them
each
had
had
a
present
from
papa
and
that
was
almost
more
than
they
had
ventured
to
hope
for
but
they
were
in
gay
spirits
looking
forward
to
a
time
of
rare
enjoyment
in
spending
the
christmas
holidays
with
grandma
elsie
at

my

he
said
with
a
gratified
smile
well

she
said
rising
and
slipping
her
hand
into
his
arm
they
passed
out
of
the
room
together
the
children
following
but
on
reaching
the
hall
instead
of
going
into
the
library
they
turned
toward
the
parlor
on
the
other
side
of
it
in
which
as
the
children
well
remembered
last
year
christmas
tree
had
been
set
up
the
captain
threw
open
the
door
and
then
stood
a
larger
and
finer
tree
blazing
with
lights
from
many
tapers
and
colored
lamps
and
loaded
with
beautiful
things
oh
oh
what
a
beauty
what
a
splendid
tree
cried
the
children
dancing
about
and
clapping
their
hands
in
delight
and
we
did
know
we
were
to
have
any
at
all
mamma
vi
you
must
have
had
it
set
up
and
trimmed
it
while
we
were
gone
this
morning
did
you
oh
thank
you
ever
so
much
your
father
provided
it
and
your
thanks
are
due
to
him
far
more
than
to
me
violet
replied
with
a
in
his
direction
at
that
they
crowded
about
him
max
putting
a
hand
affectionately
into
his
and
thanking
him
with
hearty
words
of
appreciation
while
the
little
girls
hugged
and
kissed
him
to
his
heart
content
the
servants
had
gathered
about
the
door
little
elsie
mammy
among
them
with
her
nursling
in
her
arms
oh
pretty
pretty
shouted
the
little
one
clapping
her
hands
in
an
ecstacy
of
delight
let
elsie
down
mammy
come
to
papa
the
captain
said
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
carried
her
to
the
tree
and
all
around
it
pointing
out
the
pretty
things
what
would
you
like
to
have
he
asked
what
shall
papa
give
you
off
this
beautiful
tree
dolly
she
said
reaching
out
for
a
lovely
bisque
doll
seated
in
a
tiny
chair
attached
to
one
of
the
lower
branches
you
shall
have
it
it
was
put
there
on
purpose
for
papa
baby
girl
he
said
taking
it
up
carefully
and
putting
it
into
her
arms
now
let
us
see
what
we
can
find
for
mamma
and
your
brother
and
sisters
his
gift
to
violet
was
some
beautiful
lace
selected
with
the
help
of
her
mother
he
had
contrived
to
add
it
to
the
adornments
of
the
tree
without
her
knowledge
she
was
greatly
pleased
when
he
detached
and
handed
it
to
her
max
was
delighted
to
receive
a
magic
lantern
and
a
sleight
of
hand
outfit
lulu
a
game
of
lawn
and
parlor
ring
toss
and
a
handsome
toilet
case
grace
had
the
same
and
beside
a
brass
bedstead
for
her
dolls
with
mattress
and
pillows
and
a
large
and
complete
assortment
of
everything
needed
for
making
and
dressing
paper
dolls
that
last
was
from
lulu
there
were
books
periodicals
a
type
writer
and
games
to
be
shared
by
all
three
beside
other
less
important
gifts
from
one
to
the
other
and
from
outside
friends
the
servants
too
were
remembered
with
gifts
suited
to
their
needs
and
tastes
and
there
were
fruits
and
confections
for
all
examining
their
own
and
each
other
gifts
peeping
into
the
new
books
trying
the
new
games
with
papa
and
mamma
helping
the
children
found
the
evening
pass
very
quickly
and
delightfully
we
were
going
to
hang
up
our
stockings
grace
remarked
as
the
good
nights
were
being
said
but
we
had
so
many
nice
things
already
that
it
does
seem
as
if
we
ought
to
do
it
oh
yes
hang
them
up
said
her
father
laughingly
santa
claus
feel
obliged
to
put
anything
into
them
and
perhaps
if
he
does
find
them
hanging
up
he
may
feel
hurt
at
your
low
opinion
of
his
generosity
laughed
violet
oh
i
would
like
to
hurt
his
feelings
i
sure
he
must
be
a
very
nice
old
fellow
returned
the
little
girl
with
an
arch
look
and
smile
so
i
hang
mine
up
and
i
mine
said
lulu
twining
her
arms
about
her
father
neck
and
looking
up
lovingly
into
his
face
for
i
know
he
nice
and
generous
and
good
as
gold
though
he
is
old
or
the
sort
of
person
to
be
called
a
fellow
indeed
one
might
infer
that
you
were
quite
well
acquainted
with
him
laughed
the
captain
giving
her
a
hug
and
kiss
yes
hang
it
up
and
max
if
you
do
feel
it
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
lad
of
your
size
there
will
be
no
harm
in
your
trying
the
same
experiment
i
ashamed
to
think
of
it
sir
only
because
i
already
had
so
much
said
max
but
you
are
always
safe
in
following
your
father
advice
remarked
violet
oh
yes
i
know
that
and
i
do
it
mamma
vi
returned
the
boy
with
satisfaction
now
all
three
of
you
get
to
bed
and
to
sleep
as
soon
as
you
can
in
order
to
give
the
old
fellow
a
chance
to
pay
his
visit
said
the
captain
for
i
have
always
understood
that
he
never
does
so
till
all
the
children
in
the
house
are
asleep
i
go
in
to
kiss
my
little
girls
after
they
are
snug
in
bed
but
we
will
reserve
our
talk
till
morning
yes
papa
we
will
they
said
and
hastened
away
to
do
his
bidding
at
ion
too
there
was
a
beautiful
christmas
tree
bearing
fruit
not
very
dissimilar
to
that
of
the
one
at
woodburn
it
had
been
the
occasion
of
much
mirth
and
rejoicing
on
the
part
of
the
children
and
pleasure
to
the
older
people
the
gifts
had
been
apportioned
those
of
the
servants
bestowed
and
carried
away
but
most
of
those
belonging
to
the
family
and
all
the
ornaments
were
left
upon
it
that
the
guests
of
might
be
treated
to
the
spectacle
of
its
beauty
chapter
vi
capt
raymond
going
into
gracie
room
to
fulfil
his
promise
to
give
her
a
good
night
kiss
found
lulu
there
also
the
two
lying
clasped
in
each
other
arms
we
thought
we
sleep
together
papa
said
lulu
if
willing
i
have
no
objection
he
answered
gracie
was
a
little
afraid
to
receive
santa
claus
alone
was
she
looking
down
at
them
with
a
humorous
smile
as
he
stood
by
the
bedside
oh
no
papa
i
pretty
sure
i
know
who
he
is
and
i
not
one
bit
afraid
of
him
answered
the
little
girl
with
a
merry
laugh
catching
his
hand
and
carrying
it
to
her
lips
ah
then
it
was
lulu
who
was
afraid
was
it
oh
no
sir
lu
never
afraid
of
anything
indeed
you
seem
to
have
a
high
opinion
of
her
courage
you
need
never
either
of
you
be
afraid
or
ashamed
of
anything
but
sin
my
darlings
he
added
more
gravely
if
you
are
god
children
nothing
can
harm
you
he
will
watch
over
us
through
the
dark
and
silent
night
while
we
are
wrapped
in
slumber
he
that
keepeth
israel
shall
neither
slumber
or
sleep
i
so
glad
the
bible
tells
us
that
papa
she
said
but
i
glad
too
that
you
sleep
in
the
next
room
and
have
the
door
open
always
at
night
so
that
if
i
should
want
you
you
could
easily
hear
me
call
and
come
to
me
yes
he
said
and
neither
of
my
little
girls
need
ever
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
call
for
their
father
if
they
are
ill
or
troubled
in
any
way
ah
i
see
the
stockings
hanging
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
place
but
how
is
santa
claus
to
tell
which
is
lulu
and
which
gracie
why
we
never
thought
of
that
exclaimed
lulu
laughing
but
mine
a
little
the
largest
and
it
red
and
gracie
is
blue
do
you
suppose
papa
that
he
be
smart
enough
to
guess
which
is
which
i
think
it
is
likely
but
you
will
have
to
take
the
risk
replied
her
father
then
with
a
good
night
kiss
he
left
them
to
their
slumbers
day
was
faintly
dawning
when
lulu
awoke
merry
christmas
gracie
she
whispered
in
her
sister
ear
i
going
to
get
our
stockings
and
see
if
there
is
anything
in
and
with
a
bound
she
was
out
on
the
floor
and
stealing
across
it
to
the
fireplace
with
care
to
make
no
noise
she
could
not
refrain
however
from
a
delighted
oh
as
she
laid
hold
of
the
stockings
and
felt
that
they
were
stuffed
full
of
something
did
he
come
is
there
something
in
whispered
grace
as
lulu
came
back
to
the
bedside
yes
yes
indeed
they
just
as
full
as
they
can
be
i
brought
here
yours
putting
it
into
gracie
hands
and
getting
into
bed
again
let
pull
the
things
out
and
feel
what
they
are
though
we
ca
see
much
till
it
gets
lighter
yes
let
said
grace
i
could
bear
to
wait
they
thought
they
were
keeping
very
quiet
but
lu
oh
had
wakened
her
father
and
violet
and
they
were
lying
quietly
listening
and
laughing
softly
to
themselves
there
was
a
rustle
of
paper
then
gracie
voice
in
a
loud
whisper
oh
another
dolly
for
me
and
i
just
know
it
lovely
i
can
feel
its
hair
and
its
dress
it
all
dressed
then
lulu
a
potato
just
a
horrid
raw
irish
potato
what
do
i
want
with
that
and
i
got
one
too
from
grace
oh
well
i
that
was
to
fill
up
and
maybe
there
something
nice
lower
down
a
sweet
potato
or
a
parsnip
or
something
of
that
kind
in
mine
said
lulu
some
slight
vexation
in
her
tone
oh
well
i
had
so
many
nice
things
and
this
is
only
for
fun
and
here
are
some
candies
in
mine
said
grace
have
you
got
some
yes
oh
yes
and
nuts
and
raisins
i
like
to
taste
them
but
i
think
we

them
till
after
breakfast
i
pretty
sure
papa
would
say
so
yes
he
would
so
we
wait
good
obedient
children
are
they
the
captain
said
in
a
gratified
whisper
to
violet
very
i
proud
of
them
she
responded
it
was
growing
light
and
lulu
taking
up
the
despised
potato
examined
it
more
critically
presently
she
uttered
an
exclamation
o
gracie
see
it
opens
and
there
something
inside
the
captain
and
violet
listened
intently
for
what
might
come
next
more
candies
and
something
wrapped
up
in
soft
paper
o
gracie
it
a
lovely
little
breastpin
oh
oh
how
pretty
cried
grace
i
wonder
if
i
have
one
too
in
their
excitement
they
were
forgetting
the
danger
of
disturbing
others
and
talking
quite
loud
yes
mine
opens
grace
went
on
and
oh
yes
i
got
candies
and
something
with
paper
round
it
and
oh
yes
yes
it
is
a
pin
not
quite
like
yours
but
just
every
bit
as
pretty
i
think
they
are
having
a
merry
christmas
said
the
captain
a
happy
light
in
his
eyes
and
my
love
i
wish
you
the
same
violet
returned
the
wish
but
the
children
were
talking
again
and
they
kept
quiet
to
hearken
oh
this
sweet
potato
opens
too
lulu
was
saying
and
something
that
feels
like
a
stick
o
gracie
gracie
look
it
a
gold
pencil
a
lovely
little
gold
pencil
have
you
one
no
but
you

a
doll
well
i
think
santa
claus
has
been
very
generous
and
kind
to
us
just
as
good
and
kind
as
if
he
was
our
own
papa
gracie
said
with
a
sweet
silvery
laugh
the
dear
grateful
darlings
exclaimed
the
captain
his
tone
half
tremulous
with
feeling
i
sometimes
fear
i
am
almost
too
indulgent
but
it
is
such
a
dear
delight
to
give
them
pleasure
and
i
do
believe
it
does
them
the
least
harm
so
long
as
you
do
not
indulge
them
in
any
wrong
doing
said
violet
love
never
hurts
anybody
merry
christmas
my
darlings
he
called
to
them
did
santa
claus
fill
your
stockings
oh
merry
merry
christmas
papa
they
answered
yes
sir
santa
claus
or
somebody
did
and
gave
us
lovely
things
we
very
much
obliged
to
him
as
they
spoke
the
door
into
their
little
opened
and
max
put
in
his
head
crying
in
his
turn
merry
christmas
to
you
all
papa
and
mamma
vi
lulu
and
gracie
a
chorus
of
merry
christmases
answered
him
then
lulu
asked
what
did
santa
claus
put
in
your
stocking
maxie
a
good
deal
about
as
much
as
could
be
crammed
into
it
some
handsome
neckties
candies
and
nuts
and
a
gold
pencil
very
nice
commented
lulu
and
she
and
grace
both
talking
at
once
gave
a
gleeful
account
of
their
discoveries
in
searching
their
stockings
they
had
hardly
finished
their
narrative
when
a
glad
shout
from
the
nursery
interrupted
them
there
little
elsie
has
found
her
stocking
i
do
believe
said
lulu
starting
up
to
a
sitting
posture
that
she
might
look
through
the
open
door
into
the
next
room
as
she
did
so
a
tiny
toddling
figure
clothed
in
a
white
night
dress
and
with
a
well
filled
stocking
in
its
arms
emerged
from
the
nursery
door
and
ran
across
the
room
to
the
bedside
crying
gleefully
see
mamma
papa
elsie
got
what
have
you
got
pet
asked
her
father
picking
her
up
and
setting
her
in
the
bed
there
pull
out
the
things
and
let
papa
and
mamma
see
what
they
are
may
we
come
and
see
too
asked
the
other
children
yes
he
said
you
can
come
and
peep
in
at
the
door
but
first
put
on
your
warm
slippers
and
dressing
gowns
that
you
may
not
take
cold
baby
elsie
was
a
merry
demonstrative
little
thing
and
it
was
great
fun
for
them
all
to
watch
her
and
hear
her
shouts
of
delight
as
she
came
upon
one
treasure
after
another
tiny
gaily
dressed
dolls
of
both
sexes
and
other
toys
suited
to
her
years
it
did
not
take
her
very
long
to
empty
the
stocking
and
then
the
captain
said
to
the
older
ones
now
you
may
close
the
door
my
dears
and
get
yourselves
dressed
and
ready
for
the
duties
and
pleasures
of
the
day
i
shall
be
in
presently
for
our
usual
chat
before
breakfast
they
made
haste
with
their
dressing
and
were
quite
ready
for
their
father
when
he
came
in
some
half
hour
later
they
were
very
and
gay
and
full
of
gratitude
for
all
they
had
received
dear
papa
you
are
so
good
to
us
they
said
twining
their
arms
about
his
neck
as
they
sat
one
upon
each
knee
i
want
to
be
he
said
caressing
them
in
turn
i
have
no
greater
pleasure
than
i
find
in
making
my
children
happy
and
your
grateful
appreciation
of
my
efforts
makes
me
very
happy
but
papa
i
began
lulu
then
paused
hesitatingly
well
daughter
do
be
afraid
to
let
me
know
the
thought
in
your
mind
he
said
kindly
i
was
just
wondering
why
it
right
for
me
to
have
so
many
other
things
and
would
be
wrong
for
me
to
have
that
ring
i
wanted
so
badly
but
please
papa
she
added
quickly
and
with
a
vivid
blush
think
i
mean
to
be
naughty
about
it
or
want
you
to
spend
any
more
money
on
me
no
dear
child
i
could
not
think
so
ill
of
you
i
did
not
think
it
right
or
wise
to
buy
you
the
ring
because
it
would
have
been
spending
a
great
deal
for
something
quite
useless
and
very
unsuitable
for
my
little
girl
the
things
i
have
given
you
i
considered
it
right
to
buy
because
they
will
all
be
useful
to
you
in
one
way
or
another
the
games
and
storybooks
papa
asked
grace
with
a
look
of
surprise
yes
daughter
people
and
especially
little
folks
like
max
and
lulu
and
you
need
amusement
as
a
change
and
rest
from
work
we
can
do
all
the
more
work
in
the
end
if
we
take
time
for
needed
rest
and
recreation
so
it
wo
be
time
wasted
to
have
our
christmas
holidays
remarked
lulu
half
inquiringly
no
i
think
not
her
father
answered
shall
we
take
our
new
games
to
ion
with
us
papa
she
asked
if
you
wish
i
presume
grandma
elsie
will
not
object
to
your
taking
any
of
your
possessions
with
you
that
you
think
will
be
useful
or
enjoyable
to
yourselves
or
others
i
just
sure
she
wo
she
so
kind
said
grace
but
i
it
wo
do
to
take
our
live
new
pets
no
but
you
may
safely
leave
them
in
christine
care
breakfast
and
family
worship
were
over
such
of
their
effects
as
they
would
be
likely
to
need
during
the
few
days
of
their
expected
stay
at
ion
had
been
packed
and
sent
the
family
carriage
was
at
the
door
and
every
body
nearly
ready
to
get
into
it
when
there
was
an
arrival
harold
and
herbert
had
come
over
on
horseback
rosie
and
evelyn
in
the
ion
carriage
they
came
running
in
with
their
merry
christmases
and
happy
new
years
to
receive
a
return
in
kind
do
think
for
a
moment
that
we
have
come
to
prevent
you
from
accepting
your
invitation
to
ion
as
promptly
as
possible
said
herbert
gaily
we
come
after
you
and
are
glad
to
perceive
in
your
attire
signs
of
readiness
to
depart
but
we
want
to
peep
at
your
tree
first
put
in
rosie
that
one
thing
that
brought
us
and
we
a
proposal
to
make
said
harold
namely
that
you
all
accompany
us
to
the
oaks
for
a
short
call
on
uncle
horace
and
the
rest
and
their
christmas
tree
of
course
before
going
over
to
ion
the
air
is
delightfully
bracing
the
roads
are
good
and
if
we
find
there
is
time
perhaps
we
might
as
well
extend
our
ride
to
the
laurels
and
give
aunt
rose
a
call
in
case
we
reach
there
before
the
family
have
left
home
for
ion
what
do
you
say
captain
and
you
vi
both
approved
and
the
children
were
much
pleased
with
the
idea
but
they
wanted
first
to
have
time
to
show
their
presents
to
rosie
and
evelyn
that
was
granted
the
callers
were
all
taken
in
to
see
the
tree
dog
bird
and
pussy
were
exhibited
the
pretty
things
found
in
the
stockings
also
and
when
all
had
been
duly
admired
they
set
out
upon
their
jaunt
the
four
little
girls
rosie
evelyn
lulu
and
grace
had
the
ion
carriage
to
themselves
and
full
of
life
and
spirits
enjoyed
their
drive
extremely
both
calls
were
made
only
a
short
time
spent
at
each
place
hardly
more
than
enough
for
an
exchange
of
greetings
and
a
hasty
examination
of
the
christmas
trees
and
gifts
then
they
drove
on
to
ion
and
the
holiday
festivities
so
long
looked
forward
to
by
the
young
people
with
such
eager
expectation
and
delight
began
the
first
thing
of
course
was
to
take
a
view
of
the
christmas
tree
and
the
presents
rosie
and
evelyn
had
declined
to
tell
what
they
were
until
they
could
show
them
even
refusing
to
answer
lulu
eager
query
put
while
they
were
driving
to
the
oaks
o
rosie
did
your
mamma
give
you
the
set
of
pearls
you
wanted
so
badly
wait
till
we
get
to
ion
and
i
show
you
all
my
presents
i
received
a
good
many
and
ought
not
to
fret
if
i
did
not
get
everything
i
wanted
was
what
rosie
said
in
reply
and
lulu
understanding
it
to
mean
that
there
was
some
disappointment
concluded
that
the
pearls
had
not
been
given
she
was
the
more
convinced
of
it
when
the
presents
on
and
about
the
tree
had
been
displayed
and
no
pearls
among
them
rosie
seemed
in
excellent
spirits
however
and
lulu
thought
she
had
good
reason
to
be
for
the
gifts
she
showed
as
hers
were
many
and
desirable
the
guests
all
relatives
or
connections
arrived
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
and
for
a
little
while
were
all
gathered
together
in
the
tree
room
as
the
children
called
it
for
the
time
and
a
very
merry
lively
set
they
were
but
presently
they
scattered
to
their
respective
rooms
to
dress
for
dinner
or
at
least
to
remove
their
outside
garments
the
raymonds
were
given
the
same
apartments
that
had
been
appropriated
to
them
when
living
at
ion
gracie
sharing
lulu
room
which
communicated
directly
with
the
one
where
the
captain
and
violet
would
sleep
rosie
went
with
the
little
girls
to
their
room
to
see
that
they
had
everything
to
make
them
comfortable
because
as
she
said
they
were
her
guests
this
time
you
do
need
to
change
your
dresses
i
am
sure
she
remarked
as
they
threw
off
their
coats
no
replied
lulu
these
are
what
papa
told
us
to
wear
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
they
are
as
suitable
and
pretty
as
any
we
have
yes
they
lovely
said
rosie
your
papa
does
dress
you
beautifully
i
too
am
dressed
for
the
day
and
i
like
you
both
to
come
to
my
room
for
a
while
eva
is
there
taking
off
her
things
to
share
my
room
while
the
house
is
so
full
i
thought
you
would
want
eva
for
your
bedfellow
but
mamma
said
your
father
would
want
his
two
little
girls
close
beside
him
yes
and
that
where
we
like
to
be
lulu
answered
quickly
and
in
a
very
pleasant
tone
it
seems
like
home
here
in
this
room
too
now
we
ready
to
go
with
you
rosie
we
got
our
things
off
and
seen
that
our
hair
is
all
right
rosie
led
the
way
to
her
room
where
they
found
not
eva
only
but
all
the
little
girl
cousins
having
a
chat
while
waiting
for
the
summons
to
dinner
rosie
hastily
threw
off
her
coat
and
hat
then
opening
a
bureau
drawer
took
from
it
a
jewel
case
saying
with
a
look
of
exultation
i
have
something
to
show
you
girls
mamma
christmas
gift
to
me
and
raising
the
lid
she
displayed
a
beautiful
pearl
necklace
and
bracelets
so
she
did
give
them
to
you
they
exclaimed
in
surprised
chorus
for
they
had
supposed
all
the
presents
had
been
already
shown
them
o
rosie
how
lovely
i
ever
so
glad
for
you
rosie
said
lulu
but
i
about
made
up
my
mind
that
grandma
elsie
thought
about
buying
the
pearls
for
you
as
papa
did
about
the
ring
i
wanted
mamma
did
buy
them
explained
rosie
they
are
a
set
grandpa
gave
her
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
i
think
they
are
as
handsome
as
any
she
could
have
found
any
where
she
said
she
valued
them
very
highly
as
his
gift
but
would
never
wear
them
again
and
as
i
am
her
own
little
girl
she
was
willing
to
give
them
to
me
i
think
you
pretty
big
rosie
remarked
grace
yes
in
my
fifteenth
year
almost
a
woman
as
grandpa
tells
me
sometimes
when
he
wants
to
make
me
ashamed
of
not
being
wiser
and
better
i
suppose
returned
rosie
with
a
laugh
closing
the
casket
and
returning
it
to
the
drawer
just
as
betty
the
little
maid
showed
her
black
face
and
woolly
head
at
the
half
open
door
with
the
announcement
dinnah
ready
miss
rosie
an
all
de
folks
gwine
into
de
room
very
well
we
not
sorry
to
hear
it
are
we
girls
let
us
pair
off
and
go
down
at
once
to
secure
our
fair
share
said
rosie
gaily
there
just
an
even
number
of
us
maud
and
lora
lulu
and
eva
grace
and
rosie
lacey
sydney
and
i
we
to
have
a
table
to
ourselves
i
asked
mamma
if
we
might
and
she
gave
consent
i
like
that
remarked
sydney
with
satisfaction
we
can
have
our
own
fun
and
eat
what
we
please
without
anybody
to
trouble
us
with
suggestions
that
perhaps
such
and
such
articles
of
food
may
not
agree
with
us
but
we
be
in
the
same
room
with
the
older
folks
and
they
can
overlook
us
if
they
see
fit
said
rosie
and
i
rather
have
papa
to
tell
me
what
to
eat
said
grace
they
were
hurrying
down
the
stairs
as
they
talked
and
reached
the
dining
room
just
in
time
to
take
their
places
before
the
blessing
was
asked
by
dinsmore
at
the
larger
table
it
was
a
grand
dinner
of
many
courses
and
a
good
deal
of
time
enlivened
by
cheerful
chat
was
spent
at
the
table
quiet
games
mirth
provoking
yet
requiring
little
exertion
of
mind
or
body
filled
up
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
after
tea
they
had
romping
games
but
at
nine
were
called
together
for
family
worship
then
the
younger
ones
including
lulu
and
grace
went
to
their
beds
very
willingly
too
for
the
day
begun
so
early
because
of
their
eagerness
to
examine
their
stockings
had
been
an
unusually
long
and
exciting
one
so
that
they
felt
ready
for
rest
grace
indeed
was
so
weary
that
her
father
carried
her
up
to
her
room
and
did
not
leave
her
till
she
was
snug
in
bed
she
dropped
asleep
the
instant
her
head
touched
the
pillow
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
a
little
anxiously
at
her
pale
face
you
do
think
gracie
sick
papa
do
you
asked
lulu
softly
no
i
trust
she
will
be
all
right
in
the
morning
the
darling
but
she
seems
quite
worn
out
now
he
sighed
then
sitting
down
he
drew
lulu
into
his
arms
has
it
been
a
happy
day
with
you
dear
child
he
asked
yes
papa
very
just
full
of
pleasure
and
now
that
night
has
come
i
so
glad
that
i
have
my
own
dear
papa
to
hug
me
up
close
and
that
he
going
to
sleep
in
the
next
room
to
gracie
and
me
i
glad
too
he
said
yes
we
have
a
great
deal
to
be
thankful
for
you
and
i
most
of
all
for
god
unspeakable
gift
the
dear
saviour
whose
birth
and
life
and
death
have
bought
all
our
other
blessings
for
us
my
child
try
to
keep
in
mind
always
even
when
engaged
in
your
sports
that
you
are
his
and
must
so
act
and
speak
as
to
bring
no
disgrace
upon
his
cause
make
it
your
constant
endeavor
to
honor
him
in
all
your
words
and
ways
i
do
mean
to
papa
but
oh
it
is
so
easy
to
forget
i
know
it
my
darling
i
find
it
so
too
but
we
must
watch
and
pray
asking
god
earnestly
night
and
morning
on
our
knees
to
keep
us
from
temptation
and
from
sin
and
often
sending
up
a
swift
silent
petition
from
our
hearts
at
other
times
when
we
feel
that
we
need
help
to
overcome
i
want
you
my
little
daughter
to
be
particularly
on
the
watch
against
your
besetting
sin
an
inclination
to
sudden
outbursts
of
passion
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
everything
will
move
on
as
smoothly
with
so
many
children
and
young
people
together
every
day
as
they
have
and
i
fear
you
will
be
strongly
tempted
at
times
to
give
way
to
your
naturally
quick
temper
oh
i
am
afraid
so
too
papa
and
it
would
be
perfectly
dreadful
if
i
should
she
said
with
a
half
shudder
twining
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
hiding
her
face
on
his
shoulder
oh
wo
you
ask
god
to
help
me
to
keep
from
it
yes
i
shall
i
do
every
night
and
morning
and
we
will
ask
him
together
now
chapter
vii
it
had
been
growing
colder
all
the
afternoon
and
continued
to
do
so
very
rapidly
through
the
night
the
next
morning
at
the
breakfast
table
some
of
the
lads
announced
with
great
glee
that
the
lakelet
was
frozen
over
the
ice
so
thick
and
solid
that
it
was
perfectly
safe
for
skating
in
every
part
the
news
caused
quite
a
flurry
of
pleasurable
excitement
among
the
younger
ones
of
the
company
i
move
that
we
spend
the
morning
there
said
zoe
how
many
of
us
have
skates
i
wonder
you
have
i
think
have
you
not
said
edward
yes
yours
and
mine
are
both
in
good
order
i
examined
them
only
the
other
day
the
captain
asked
how
many
knew
how
to
use
skates
and
from
the
replies
it
seemed
that
all
the
lads
had
been
more
or
less
accustomed
to
their
use
some
of
the
girls
also
zoe
had
had
quite
a
good
deal
of
practice
before
her
marriage
a
little
since
the
winters
were
usually
too
mild
in
this
part
of
the
country
to
give
much
opportunity
for
that
kind
of
exercise
she
was
therefore
the
more
eager
to
avail
herself
of
this
one
for
she
was
very
fond
of
the
sport
edward
harold
and
herbert
were
all
in
the
mood
to
join
her
in
it
and
were
prepared
to
do
so
and
rosie
and
max
too
were
equally
fortunate
but
most
of
the
others
had
come
without
skates
but
that
difficulty
could
be
easily
remedied
their
homes
were
not
far
off
nor
was
the
village
with
its
stores
where
such
things
could
be
bought
it
was
decided
to
despatch
messengers
for
the
needed
supplies
papa
said
lulu
may
they
get
a
pair
for
me
i
like
to
learn
to
skate
he
turned
to
her
with
an
indulgent
smile
would
you
then
you
shall
i
will
send
for
the
skates
and
give
you
a
lesson
in
the
art
myself
i
used
to
be
reckoned
a
good
skater
in
my
boyhood
would
my
little
grace
like
to
learn
too
no
thank
you
papa
i
rather
walk
on
the
ground
or
ride
you
shall
ride
on
the
ice
if
you
will
little
girlie
said
harold
i
think
i
can
find
a
conveyance
that
will
suit
your
taste
you
kind
to
think
of
it
uncle
harold
she
said
with
a
dubious
look
but
i
afraid
the
horses
would
slip
and
fall
on
the
ice
i
think
not
he
said
but
if
they
should
they
will
only
have
to
pick
themselves
up
again
and
go
on
but
i
afraid
they
might
get
hurt
and
maybe
tip
me
over
too
harold
only
smiled
at
that
as
he
rose
and
left
the
room
to
attend
to
the
despatching
of
the
messengers
grace
wondered
what
he
meant
but
as
the
older
people
all
about
her
were
busily
talking
among
themselves
she
went
on
quietly
with
her
breakfast
and
said
no
more
are
you
a
skater
my
dear
asked
the
captain
addressing
his
wife
i
used
to
be
a
tolerably
expert
one
and
moderately
fond
of
the
exercise
she
replied
i
should
like
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
out
this
morning
for
a
trial
of
your
skill
he
said
shall
i
send
for
skates
for
you
thank
you
no
i
think
i
have
a
pair
somewhere
about
the
house
and
perhaps
can
find
another
for
you
there
are
several
pairs
of
gentlemen
skates
said
her
mother
i
will
have
them
brought
out
for
the
captain
to
try
he
thanked
her
adding
that
in
case
a
pair
should
be
found
to
fit
he
could
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
his
wife
out
without
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
servant
despatched
to
the
village
upon
leaving
the
breakfast
table
they
all
repaired
to
the
parlor
for
family
worship
as
was
their
custom
morning
and
evening
then
those
who
had
skates
and
some
who
wanted
the
walk
and
a
near
view
of
the
skating
lulu
among
them
got
themselves
ready
and
went
to
the
lakelet
while
the
others
waited
for
the
return
of
the
messengers
most
of
them
meanwhile
gathered
about
the
windows
overlooking
the
lakelet
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
skaters
edward
zoe
harold
herbert
rosie
evelyn
and
max
presently
joined
by
capt
raymond
and
violet
a
pair
of
skates
having
been
found
to
fit
each
of
them
when
all
were
fairly
started
the
scene
became
very
animated
and
pretty
the
two
married
couples
skated
well
but
harold
and
especially
herbert
far
exceeded
them
the
swift
easy
movement
with
which
they
glided
over
the
glassy
surface
of
the
lake
the
exact
balancing
of
their
bodies
and
the
graceful
curves
they
executed
called
forth
many
an
admiring
and
delighted
exclamation
from
the
onlookers
both
near
at
hand
and
farther
away
at
the
windows
of
the
mansion
among
the
latter
were
grandma
elsie
her
father
and
his
wife
grandma
rose
and
cousin
ronald
bravo
cried
the
two
old
gentlemen
simultaneously
as
herbert
performed
a
feat
in
which
he
seemed
to
fairly
outdo
himself
lilburn
adding
i
feel
the
old
ardor
for
the
sport
stir
within
me
at
sight
o
the
lad
adroit
movements
at
his
age
i
might
have
ventured
to
compete
with
as
expert
a
skater
as
he
what
say
you
cousin
horace
to
a
match
atween
the
two
auld
chaps
o
us
down
there
the
noo
agreed
dinsmore
said
with
a
laugh
there
are
skates
that
will
answer
our
purpose
i
think
and
we
will
set
off
at
once
if
you
like
at
that
moment
lulu
came
running
in
the
skates
have
come
grandma
elsie
she
said
just
as
i
have
got
back
to
the
house
papa
sent
me
in
because
it
was
too
cold
he
said
for
me
to
be
standing
still
out
there
he
come
for
me
when
mamma
vi
is
tired
and
wants
to
come
in
does
she
seem
to
be
enjoying
it
asked
the
person
addressed
oh
yes
very
much
indeed
are
you
going
to
try
it
too
yes
do
elsie
said
her
father
and
you
too
rose
to
his
wife
let
us
all
try
the
sport
while
we
have
an
opportunity
the
ladies
were
nothing
loath
everybody
seemed
to
catch
the
spirit
of
the
hour
the
skates
were
quickly
distributed
and
all
hurried
away
to
the
lake
but
lulu
and
grace
who
were
to
stay
within
doors
by
their
father
orders
till
he
came
or
sent
for
them
lulu
having
taken
off
her
hood
and
coat
now
sat
before
the
fire
warming
her
feet
grace
was
watching
the
skaters
from
an
easy
chair
by
the
window
it
does
look
like
good
fun
she
said
is
it
very
cold
out
there
lu
not
so
very
the
wind
does
blow
but
when
you
been
standing
still
a
while
your
feet
feel
right
cold
i
hardly
thought
about
it
though
i
was
so
taken
up
with
watching
the
skating
till
papa
called
to
me
that
it
was
too
cold
for
me
to
stand
there
and
i
must
come
in
papa
always
taking
care
of
his
children
remarked
grace
yes
assented
lulu
he
never
seems
to
forget
us
at
all
i
most
wish
he
would
sometimes
she
added
laughing
just
once
in
a
while
when
i
feel
like
having
my
own
way
you
know
was
he
good
to
send
for
these
for
me
she
went
on
holding
up
her
new
skates
and
regarding
them
with
much
satisfaction
they
nice
ones
and
it
be
nice
to
have
him
teach
me
how
to
use
them
i
heard
of
people
getting
hard
falls
learning
how
to
skate
but
i
think
i
be
pretty
safe
not
to
fall
with
papa
to
attend
to
me
i
should
think
so
said
grace
oh
papa
and
mamma
have
stopped
and
i
do
believe
they
taking
off
their
skates
at
least
papa
taking
her
off
for
her
i
think
oh
then
they
coming
in
and
we
get
our
turn
i
do
want
to
try
it
no
but
you
can
walk
down
there
and
then
you
to
have
a
ride
on
the
ice
you
know
uncle
harold
said
so
i
do
know
what
he
meant
and
i
do
know
whether
i
want
to
try
it
either
yes
papa
and
mamma
are
both
coming
back
violet
had
soon
tired
of
the
sport
and
beside
feared
her
baby
was
wanting
her
she
went
on
up
to
the
nursery
while
the
captain
entered
the
parlor
where
his
little
girls
were
waiting
for
his
coming
waiting
patiently
my
darlings
he
said
with
an
affectionate
smile
i
know
it
is
rather
hard
sometimes
for
little
folks
to
wait
but
you
may
bundle
up
now
and
i
will
take
you
out
to
enjoy
the
sport
with
the
rest
it
will
be
a
nice
walk
for
you
gracie
and
when
you
get
there
you
will
have
a
pleasant
time
i
think
how
papa
my
little
girl
will
see
when
she
gets
there
he
said
ah
here
is
agnes
with
your
hood
and
coat
now
while
she
puts
them
on
you
i
will
see
if
lulu
skates
are
quite
right
they
proved
to
be
a
good
fit
and
in
few
minutes
the
captain
was
on
his
way
to
the
lakelet
with
a
little
girl
clinging
to
each
hand
a
pretty
boat
house
stood
at
the
water
edge
on
the
hither
side
under
the
trees
and
now
close
beside
it
on
the
ice
the
children
spied
a
small
light
sleigh
well
supplied
with
robes
of
wolf
and
bear
skins
there
gracie
how
would
you
like
to
ride
in
that
asked
her
father
it
looks
nice
but
how
can
it
go
she
asked
dubiously
i
do
see
any
horses
papa
no
but
you
will
find
that
it
can
move
without
harold
had
seen
them
approaching
and
now
came
gliding
very
rapidly
towards
them
on
his
skates
ah
gracie
are
you
ready
for
your
ride
he
asked
rosie
lacey
and
one
or
two
of
the
other
little
ones
are
going
to
share
it
with
you
captain
will
you
lift
her
in
while
i
summon
them
here
we
are
cousin
harold
called
a
childish
voice
and
rose
lacey
came
running
up
almost
out
of
breath
with
haste
and
excitement
two
other
little
girl
cousins
following
at
her
heels
here
we
are
can
you
take
us
now
yes
he
said
i
was
just
about
to
call
you
in
another
minute
the
four
were
in
the
sleigh
with
the
robes
well
tucked
around
them
then
harold
taking
hold
of
the
back
of
the
vehicle
gave
it
a
vigorous
shove
away
from
the
shore
and
keeping
a
tight
grip
on
it
propelled
it
quite
rapidly
around
the
lake
it
required
a
good
deal
of
exertion
but
herbert
and
others
came
to
his
assistance
and
the
sleigh
made
the
circuit
many
times
its
young
occupants
laughing
chatting
and
singing
right
merrily
the
gayest
of
the
gay
meanwhile
the
others
enjoyed
the
skating
perhaps
quite
as
much
the
older
ladies
and
the
two
old
gentlemen
seemed
to
have
renewed
their
youth
and
kept
up
the
sport
a
good
deal
longer
than
they
had
intended
in
the
beginning
while
the
younger
ones
and
especially
the
children
were
full
of
mirth
and
jollity
challenging
each
other
to
trials
of
speed
and
skill
laughing
at
little
mishaps
and
exchanging
jests
and
good
humored
banter
and
cousin
ronald
added
to
the
fun
by
causing
them
to
hear
again
and
again
sounds
as
of
jingling
sleighbells
and
prancing
horses
in
their
rear
so
distinct
and
natural
were
these
sounds
that
they
could
not
help
springing
aside
out
of
the
track
of
the
supposed
steeds
and
turning
their
heads
to
see
how
near
they
were
then
shouts
of
laughter
would
follow
from
old
and
young
of
both
sexes
mingled
with
little
shrieks
half
of
affright
and
half
of
amusement
from
the
girls
while
all
this
was
going
on
capt
raymond
was
giving
lulu
her
first
lesson
in
the
use
of
skates
holding
her
hand
in
his
guarding
her
carefully
from
the
danger
of
falling
but
for
that
she
would
have
fallen
several
times
for
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
keep
her
balance
however
she
gained
skill
and
confidence
and
at
length
asked
to
be
allowed
to
try
it
for
a
little
unaided
he
permitted
her
to
do
so
but
kept
very
near
to
catch
her
in
case
she
should
slip
or
stagger
she
succeeded
very
well
and
after
a
time
he
ceased
to
watch
her
constantly
remaining
near
her
but
taking
his
eyes
off
her
now
and
then
to
see
what
others
were
doing
noting
with
fatherly
pride
in
his
son
how
max
was
emulating
the
older
skaters
and
returning
a
joyous
look
and
smile
given
him
by
gracie
as
she
swept
past
in
the
sleigh
it
presently
stopped
a
few
paces
away
and
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
go
and
lift
her
out
but
at
the
sound
of
a
thud
on
the
ice
behind
him
turned
quickly
again
to
find
lulu
down
she
had
thrown
out
her
hands
in
falling
and
he
felt
a
thrill
of
horror
as
he
perceived
that
one
of
them
lay
directly
in
the
path
of
a
skater
chester
dinsmore
who
was
moving
with
such
velocity
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
check
his
speed
in
time
to
avoid
running
over
her
but
even
while
he
perceived
her
peril
the
captain
had
with
an
almost
lightning
like
movement
stooped
over
his
child
and
dragged
her
backward
barely
in
time
chester
skate
just
grazed
her
fingers
cutting
off
the
tip
of
her
mitten
there
were
drops
of
blood
on
the
ice
and
for
a
moment
her
father
thought
her
fingers
were
off
oh
my
child
my
darling
he
groaned
holding
her
close
in
his
arms
and
taking
the
bleeding
hand
tenderly
in
his
i
not
hurt
papa
at
least
only
a
very
little
she
hastened
to
say
while
the
others
crowded
about
them
with
agitated
anxious
questioning
is
lulu
hurt
did
chess
run
over
her
did
the
fall
hurt
her
my
fingers
are
bleeding
a
little
but
they
do
hurt
very
much
she
answered
i
think
his
skate
went
over
my
mitten
and
i
suppose
my
fingers
would
have
been
cut
off
if
papa
had
jerked
me
back
out
of
the
way
chester
had
just
joined
the
group
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
thankful
for
the
escape
he
said
with
a
slight
tremble
in
his
tones
i
could
never
have
forgiven
myself
if
i
had
maimed
that
pretty
hand
though
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
stop
myself
in
time
at
the
headlong
rate
of
speed
with
which
i
was
moving
your
thankfulness
can
hardly
equal
her
father
the
captain
said
with
emotion
almost
too
big
for
utterance
as
he
gently
drew
off
the
mitten
and
bound
up
the
wounded
fingers
with
his
handkerchief
that
will
do
till
i
get
you
to
the
house
shall
i
carry
you
daughter
oh
no
papa
i
quite
able
to
walk
she
answered
in
a
very
cheerful
tone
please
do
be
so
troubled
i
sure
i
not
much
hurt
allow
me
to
take
off
your
skates
for
you
chester
said
kneeling
down
on
the
ice
at
their
feet
and
beginning
to
undo
the
straps
as
he
spoke
and
i
will
gladly
carry
you
up
to
the
house
too
if
you
and
your
father
are
willing
oh
thank
you
sir
but
i
really
rather
walk
with
papa
to
help
me
along
the
accident
had
sobered
the
party
a
good
deal
and
most
of
them
including
the
older
people
and
lulu
mates
went
back
to
the
house
with
her
and
her
father
violet
was
quite
startled
and
alarmed
to
see
the
child
brought
in
with
her
hand
bound
up
but
when
the
blood
had
been
washed
away
the
wounds
were
found
to
be
little
more
than
skin
deep
the
bleeding
soon
ceased
and
some
was
all
that
was
needed
to
cover
up
the
cuts
there
were
plenty
of
offers
of
assistance
but
the
captain
chose
to
do
for
her
himself
all
that
was
required
there
my
dear
child
you
have
had
a
very
narrow
escape
he
said
when
he
had
finished
drawing
her
into
his
arms
and
caressing
her
with
great
tenderness
what
a
heartbreaking
thing
it
would
have
been
for
us
both
had
this
little
hand
taking
it
tenderly
in
his
been
robbed
of
its
fingers
far
worse
to
me
than
to
have
lost
my
own
and
you
have
saved
them
for
me
you
dear
father
she
said
clinging
about
his
neck
and
laying
her
cheek
to
his
her
eyes
full
of
tears
a
slight
tremble
in
her
voice
but
they
are
yours
because
i
am
she
added
laughing
a
little
hysterically
oh
i
every
bit
yours
from
the
crown
of
my
head
to
the
soles
of
my
feet
yes
so
you
are
one
of
my
choice
treasures
my
darling
he
said
with
emotion
and
my
heart
is
full
of
thankfulness
to
god
our
heavenly
father
for
enabling
me
to
save
you
from
being
so
sadly
maimed
and
i
do
think
your
mamma
vi
is
almost
as
thankful
as
either
of
you
violet
said
coming
to
his
side
and
softly
smoothing
lulu
hair
they
were
in
the
no
one
else
present
but
grace
and
max
i
pretty
thankful
myself
observed
the
latter
jocosely
but
with
a
telltale
moisture
about
the
eyes
i
should
like
to
have
a
sister
with
a
fingerless
hand
oh
do
max
do
talk
so
sobbed
grace
i
just
ca
bear
to
think
of
such
dreadful
things
her
father
turned
toward
her
and
held
out
his
hand
she
sprang
to
his
side
and
he
put
his
arm
about
her
the
danger
is
happily
past
my
pet
he
said
touching
his
lips
to
her
cheek
so
dry
your
eyes
and
think
of
something
else
something
pleasanter
you
got
enough
of
skating
i
suppose
lu
you
wo
want
to
try
it
again
will
you
asked
max
yes
if
papa
will
let
me
i
like
to
go
back
this
afternoon
but
want
to
keep
fast
hold
of
him
so
that
i
be
in
no
danger
of
falling
she
added
looking
lovingly
into
his
eyes
i
not
let
you
try
it
in
any
other
way
for
some
time
to
come
he
said
stroking
her
hair
you
must
become
a
good
deal
more
proficient
in
the
use
of
skates
before
i
can
again
trust
you
to
go
alone
especially
where
there
are
so
many
other
and
more
skilful
skaters
i
do
care
for
that
papa
but
will
you
take
me
there
again
this
afternoon
we
see
about
it
when
the
time
comes
he
said
smiling
at
her
eager
tone
and
not
at
this
proof
of
a
persevering
disposition
oh
cried
max
glancing
toward
the
window
it
snowing
fast
dear
dear
it
will
spoil
the
skating
for
all
of
us
but
a
good
fall
of
snow
will
provide
other
pleasures
my
son
remarked
the
captain
in
a
cheery
tone
yes
sir
so
it
will
returned
max
echoing
the
tone
and
beside
plenty
of
indoor
amusements
have
been
provided
said
violet
i
think
we
can
all
enjoy
ourselves
vastly
let
the
weather
outside
be
what
it
will
i
am
sure
of
it
said
her
husband
gracie
how
did
you
enjoy
your
ride
oh
it
was
just
lovely
papa
answered
the
little
girl
the
sleigh
skimmed
along
so
nicely
without
a
bit
of
jolting
and
then
too
it
was
such
fun
to
watch
the
skaters
a
tap
at
the
door
and
rosie
voice
asking
how
is
lulu
mamma
sent
me
to
inquire
come
in
rosie
said
the
captain
mother
is
very
kind
and
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
report
to
her
that
lulu
is
only
very
slightly
hurt
so
slightly
that
doubtless
she
will
be
ready
to
join
her
mates
in
any
sport
that
may
be
going
on
this
afternoon
rosie
drew
near
with
a
look
of
commiseration
on
her
face
but
exclaimed
in
surprise
why
your
hand
is
even
bound
up
no
i
have
just
a
patch
of
court
plaster
on
each
of
three
finger
tips
returned
lulu
laughingly
displaying
them
but
oh
what
a
narrow
escape
cried
rosie
half
breathlessly
it
fairly
frightens
me
to
think
of
it
they
all
have
been
cut
off
if
it
had
been
for
papa
lulu
said
with
a
shudder
hiding
her
face
on
his
shoulder
o
lu
i
so
glad
they
were
said
rosie
eva
has
been
crying
fit
to
break
her
heart
because
she
was
sure
that
at
least
the
tips
of
your
fingers
had
been
taken
off
and
in
fact
i
could
help
crying
myself
she
added
turning
away
to
wipe
her
eyes
how
good
in
you
both
exclaimed
lulu
lifting
her
head
and
showing
flushed
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
papa
sha
i
go
and
find
eva
and
comfort
her
by
letting
her
see
how
little
i
am
hurt
after
all
yes
do
my
child
he
said
releasing
her
the
two
little
girls
went
from
the
room
together
each
with
her
arm
about
the
other
waist
eva
in
my
room
taking
her
cry
out
by
herself
said
rosie
i
like
to
go
there
with
you
but
i
must
carry
your
father
answer
to
mamma
first
then
i
join
you
the
door
of
rosie
room
stood
open
evelyn
sat
with
her
back
toward
it
and
lulu
entering
softly
had
an
arm
round
her
friend
neck
before
she
was
aware
of
her
presence
o
lu
cried
evelyn
with
a
start
are
you
much
hurt
no
you
poor
dear
you
been
breaking
your
heart
about
almost
nothing
i
hurt
my
knees
a
little
in
falling
and
chester
skate
took
a
tiny
slice
out
of
my
middle
finger
and
scratched
the
one
each
side
of
it
but
that
all
see
they
do
even
need
to
be
wrapped
up
oh
i
so
glad
exclaimed
eva
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
smiling
through
tears
then
with
a
shudder
and
hugging
lulu
close
it
would
have
been
too
horrible
if
they
been
cut
off
i
think
skating
is
dangerous
and
i
not
sorry
the
snow
has
come
to
spoil
it
for
us
girls
i
mean
the
older
folks
and
the
boys
can
take
care
of
themselves
i
suppose
oh
i
like
it
said
lulu
i
wanted
papa
to
let
me
go
back
this
afternoon
and
try
it
again
and
i
think
he
would
if
the
snow
come
you
surprise
me
exclaimed
evelyn
if
i
had
come
so
near
losing
my
fingers
i
never
care
to
skate
any
more
i
always
did
like
boys
sports
remarked
lulu
laughing
aunt
beulah
used
to
call
me
a
and
even
max
would
sometimes
say
he
believed
i
was
half
boy
i
was
always
so
glad
of
a
chance
to
slip
off
to
the
woods
with
him
where
i
could
run
and
jump
and
climb
without
any
body
by
to
scold
me
and
tell
me
i
tear
my
clothes
i
do
have
to
do
those
things
without
leave
now
for
papa
lets
me
he
say
it
good
for
my
health
and
that
that
of
far
more
importance
than
my
clothes
oh
we
all
do
have
such
good
times
now
at
home
in
our
father
house
with
him
to
take
care
of
us
yes
i
sure
you
do
and
i
so
glad
for
you
how
happy
you
all
seem
and
how
brave
you
are
about
bearing
pain
dear
lu
you
are
so
bright
and
cheerful
though
i
sure
your
fingers
must
ache
do
they
yes
some
but
i
do
mind
it
very
much
and
they
soon
be
well
just
then
they
were
joined
by
several
of
the
other
little
girls
all
anxious
to
see
lulu
and
learn
whether
she
were
really
badly
hurt
they
crowded
round
her
with
eager
questions
and
many
expressions
of
sympathy
first
then
of
delight
in
finding
her
so
cheerful
and
suffering
so
little
the
next
thing
was
to
plan
indoor
amusements
for
the
afternoon
and
evening
as
evidently
the
storm
had
put
outdoor
pleasures
out
of
the
question
for
that
day
the
call
to
dinner
interrupted
them
in
the
midst
of
their
talk
a
not
unwelcome
summons
for
exercise
in
the
bracing
winter
air
had
given
them
keen
appetites
some
of
the
younger
ones
who
had
particularly
enjoyed
the
skating
felt
a
good
deal
disappointed
that
the
storm
had
come
to
put
a
stop
to
it
and
were
in
consequence
quite
sober
and
subdued
in
their
demeanor
as
they
took
their
seats
at
the
table
a
moment
of
complete
silence
followed
the
asking
of
the
blessing
then
as
edward
took
up
a
and
stuck
the
fork
into
a
roast
duck
in
front
of
him
there
was
a
loud
quack
quack
that
startled
everybody
for
an
instant
followed
by
merry
peals
of
laughter
from
old
and
young
a
loud
squeal
came
next
from
a
young
pig
in
a
dish
placed
before
dinsmore
and
the
song
of
the
blackbird
from
a
pie
grandma
elsie
was
beginning
to
help
and
twenty
blackbirds
baked
in
a
pie
remarked
lilburn
gravely
the
pie
was
opened
the
birds
began
to
sing
was
that
a
dainty
dish
to
set
before
a
king
ah
ha
um
h
ah
ha
history
repeats
itself
but
cousin
elsie
i
didna
expect
to
be
treated
to
a
meal
o
livin
creatures
in
your
house
did
you
not
she
returned
with
a
smile
life
is
full
of
surprises
and
grandpa
and
ned
go
on
carving
without
any
apparent
thought
of
the
cruelty
of
cutting
into
living
creatures
laughed
zoe
and
what
a
singular
circumstance
that
chickens
baked
in
a
pie
should
sing
like
blackbirds
remarked
grandma
elsie
very
indeed
said
capt
raymond
i
move
that
some
one
prepare
an
article
on
the
subject
for
one
of
the
leading
magazines
no
one
better
qualified
for
the
task
than
yourself
sir
said
his
lester
leland
you
will
surely
except
our
cousin
ronald
said
the
captain
doubtless
he
knows
more
about
the
phenomenon
than
any
other
person
present
o
cousin
ronald
broke
in
walter
as
we
ca
go
skating
this
afternoon
wo
you
please
tell
us
young
ones
some
of
your
famous
stories
perhaps
laddie
but
there
may
be
some
other
amusement
provided
and
in
that
case
the
tales
will
keep
it
strikes
me
i
heard
some
o
the
leddies
laying
plans
for
the
afternoon
and
evening
he
added
turning
inquiringly
in
zoe
direction
yes
sir
she
said
we
are
getting
up
some
tableaux
but
are
ready
to
defer
them
if
any
one
wishes
to
do
something
else
i
think
we
will
not
tax
cousin
ronald
with
story
telling
said
grandma
elsie
he
has
been
making
a
good
deal
of
exertion
in
skating
and
i
know
must
feel
weary
are
you
cousin
ronald
asked
walter
well
laddie
i
can
no
deny
that
there
have
been
times
when
i
felt
a
bit
brighter
and
more
in
the
mood
for
spinning
out
a
yarn
as
the
sailors
say
and
perhaps
you
like
to
see
the
tableaux
too
sir
yes
i
own
that
i
should
that
settled
the
question
we
will
have
the
tableaux
grandma
elsie
said
and
every
body
seemed
well
satisfied
with
the
decision
preparations
were
begun
almost
immediately
on
leaving
the
table
and
pretty
much
all
the
short
winter
afternoon
occupied
with
them
they
had
their
exhibition
after
tea
a
very
satisfactory
one
to
those
who
took
part
and
to
the
spectators
every
child
and
young
person
who
was
desirous
to
have
it
so
was
brought
in
to
one
or
more
of
the
pictures
lulu
to
her
great
delight
appeared
in
several
and
did
herself
credit
how
are
the
fingers
dear
child
have
they
been
giving
you
much
pain
the
captain
asked
when
he
came
to
her
room
for
the
usual
talk
sitting
down
as
he
spoke
drawing
her
to
a
seat
upon
his
knee
and
taking
the
wounded
hand
tenderly
in
his
only
a
twinge
once
in
a
while
papa
she
said
putting
the
other
arm
round
his
neck
and
smiling
into
his
eyes
it
been
a
very
nice
day
for
me
in
spite
of
my
accident
everybody
has
been
so
good
and
kind
i
think
they
tried
to
give
me
a
pleasant
part
in
as
many
of
the
tableaux
as
they
could
to
comfort
me
and
really
after
all
it
was
only
a
little
bit
of
a
hurt
but
narrowly
escaped
being
a
very
serious
one
ah
my
heart
is
full
of
thankfulness
to
god
for
you
my
darling
and
for
myself
that
the
injury
was
no
greater
you
might
have
lost
your
fingers
or
your
hand
you
might
even
have
been
killed
by
falling
in
such
a
way
as
to
strike
your
head
very
hard
upon
the
ice
did
anybody
ever
get
killed
in
that
way
papa
she
asked
yes
i
have
read
or
heard
of
one
or
two
such
cases
and
had
it
happened
to
you
i
could
hardly
forgive
myself
for
letting
go
your
hand
i
sure
you
might
feel
that
it
was
all
my
own
fault
papa
she
said
tightening
her
clasp
of
his
neck
and
kissing
him
with
ardent
affection
every
bit
my
own
fault
because
i
begged
you
to
let
me
try
it
alone
no
that
could
not
have
excused
me
because
it
is
a
father
duty
to
take
every
care
of
his
child
whether
she
wishes
it
or
not
and
it
is
my
settled
purpose
to
do
so
henceforward
he
said
returning
her
caress
with
great
tenderness
chapter
viii
the
storm
continued
through
the
night
but
had
ceased
before
the
guests
at
ion
were
astir
the
ground
was
thickly
carpeted
with
snow
and
clouds
still
obscured
the
sun
but
there
was
no
wind
and
the
cold
was
not
severe
just
the
day
for
a
snow
fight
remarked
frank
dinsmore
as
he
and
the
other
lads
of
the
company
stood
grouped
together
on
the
veranda
shortly
after
breakfast
plenty
of
snow
and
in
prime
condition
for
making
into
balls
so
it
is
said
herbert
travilla
and
i
believe
i
boy
enough
yet
to
enjoy
a
scrimmage
in
it
i
too
said
harold
let
build
a
fort
divide
ourselves
into
two
armies
one
besiege
and
the
other
defend
it
the
proposition
was
received
with
enthusiasm
and
the
work
of
erecting
the
snow
fort
begun
at
once
some
of
the
girls
wanted
to
help
but
were
told
their
part
was
to
look
on
i
can
do
more
than
that
said
rosie
and
darting
into
the
house
she
presently
returned
with
a
small
flag
here
plant
this
on
your
ramparts
harold
she
said
if
you
are
to
defend
the
fort
i
do
know
yet
to
which
party
i
shall
belong
besiegers
or
besieged
but
i
obliged
for
the
flag
and
shall
plant
it
as
you
advise
he
said
the
girls
amused
themselves
snowballing
each
other
occasionally
pausing
to
watch
the
progress
the
lads
were
making
the
older
people
doing
the
same
from
the
veranda
or
the
windows
of
the
mansion
the
boys
were
active
and
soon
had
their
fort
not
a
large
one
constructed
and
the
flag
planted
and
waving
in
a
slight
wind
that
had
sprung
up
lulu
standing
on
the
veranda
steps
clapped
her
hands
in
delight
as
it
was
flung
to
the
breeze
and
started
that
star
spangled
banner
all
the
others
joining
in
and
singing
with
a
will
then
the
lads
divided
themselves
into
two
companies
harold
taking
command
of
the
defenders
of
the
fort
chester
of
the
attacking
party
there
are
not
enough
of
you
fellows
called
sydney
you
better
let
us
girls
help
prepare
the
ammunition
women
have
done
such
things
when
men
were
scarce
so
they
have
replied
chester
i
accept
such
assistance
from
you
while
you
stand
back
out
of
danger
then
we
girls
will
have
to
divide
into
two
companies
said
rosie
for
the
boys
in
the
fort
must
have
the
same
kind
of
help
the
others
do
i
go
to
them
no
no
said
harold
this
is
going
to
be
too
much
of
a
rough
and
tumble
play
for
girls
i
decline
with
thanks
ungrateful
fellow
she
retorted
i
do
mean
to
be
a
bit
sorry
for
you
if
you
are
defeated
i
do
not
intend
that
you
shall
have
the
opportunity
he
returned
with
a
good
humored
laugh
o
rosie
i
know
what
we
can
do
cried
lulu
give
them
some
music
good
said
sydney
wait
a
minute
boys
till
we
hunt
up
a
drum
and
fife
the
band
will
play
on
the
veranda
she
rosie
and

hurried
into
the
house
as
she
spoke

shouted
walter
after
them
they
up
in
the
two
drums
two
mouth
organs
and
a
fife
and
a
trumpet
the
boys
waited
employing
the
time
in
preparing
piles
of
snowballs
and
presently
the
girls
came
rushing
back
bringing
the
musical
instruments
mentioned
by
walter
and
a
and
accordeon
beside
these
were
quickly
distributed
and
the
band
struck
up
not
one
tune
but
several
hail
columbia
yankee
doodle
and
star
spangled
banner
having
forgotten
in
their
haste
to
agree
upon
a
tune
the
music
if
music
it
could
be
called
was
greeted
with
roars
of
laughter
and
ceased
at
once
oh
this
will
never
do
cried
maud
we
must
settle
upon
some
one
of
the
national
airs
shall
it
be
doodle
yes
they
all
said
and
began
again
with
less
discord
but
not
keeping
very
good
time
harold
and
his
party
were
in
the
fort
a
huge
heap
of
balls
beside
them
now

lads
and
be
ready
to
give
a
vigorous
repulse
to
the
approaching
foe

said

drawn
up
his
men
in
line
of
battle
max
was
among
them
wait
he
cried
i
going
into
the
fort
what

to

in
the
face
of
the
enemy
queried
chester

the
stars
and
stripes

union
forever
oh

that
all
well
we
not
going
to

my
boy

and
we
going
to
take
it
from
them
and
carry
it
in
triumph
at
the
head
of
our
column

retorted
harold
and
we
stand
ready
to
defend
it
to
the
last
gasp
come
on
take
it
if
you
can
we
dare
you
to
do
it
up
then
and
at
boys
shouted
chester
go
double
quick
and
charge
right
over
the
breast
works
the
command
was
instantly
obeyed
the
works
were
vigorously
assaulted
and
as
vigorously
defended
snowballs
flying
thick
and
fast
in
both
directions
max
leaped
over
the
breast
works
and
seized
the
flag
harold
tore
it
from
his
hands
threw
him
over
into
the
snow
on
the
outside
and
replanted
the
flag
on
the
top
of
the
breast
work
max
picked
himself
up
ran
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
fort
and
finding
harold
and
the
other
large
boys
among
the
defenders
each
engaged
in
a
hand
to
hand
scuffle
with
a
besieger
so
that
only
little
walter
was
left
to
oppose
him
again
leaped
over
the
barrier
seized
the
flag
leaped
back
and
sped
away
toward
the
house
waving
it
in
triumph
and
shouting
hurrah
victory
is
ours
not
so
fast
young
man
shouted
back
herbert
bounding
over
the
breast
works
and
giving
chase
all
the
rest
following
some
to
aid
him
in
recovering
the
lost
standard
the
others
to
help
max
to
keep
out
of
his
reach
herbert
was
agile
and
fleet
of
foot
but
so
was
max
back
and
forth
up
and
down
he
ran
now
dodging
his
pursuers
behind
trees
and
shrubs
now
taking
a
flying
leap
over
some
low
obstacle
and
speeding
on
waving
the
flag
above
his
head
and
shouting
back
derisively
at
those
who
were
trying
to
catch
him
it
was
a
long
and
exciting
race
but
at
last
he
was
caught
herbert
overtook
him
seized
him
with
one
hand
the
flag
with
the
other
max
wrenched
himself
free
but
herbert
superior
strength
compelled
him
to
yield
the
flag
after
a
desperate
struggle
to
retain
his
hold
upon
it
then
with
a
wild
hue
and
cry
chester
party
chased
herbert
till
after
doubling
and
turning
several
times
he
at
length
regained
the
fort
and
restored
the
flag
to
its
place
the
next
instant
harold
and
the
rest
of
his
command
regained
and
reoccupied
the
fort
the
attacking
party
following
close
at
their
heels
and
the
battle
with
the
snowballs
recommenced
with
redoubled
fury
all
this
was
witnessed
with
intense
interest
by
the
spectators
at
the
windows
and
on
the
veranda
at
the
beginning
of
the
chase
the
band
forgot
to
play
and
dropping
their
instruments
employed
themselves
in
encouraging
pursuers
or
pursued
with
clapping
of
hands
and
shouts
of
exultation
over
their
exploits
the
contest
was
kept
up
for
a
long
time
the
flag
taken
and
retaken
again
and
again
till
the
fort
was
quite
demolished
by
the
repeated
assaults
and
the
snow
well
trodden
down
all
about
the
spot
where
it
had
stood
the
lads
too
found
themselves
ready
to
enjoy
rest
within
doors
after
their
continued
violent
exertion
some
quiet
games
filled
up
the
remainder
of
the
morning
and
the
afternoon
in
the
evening
they
were
ready
for
another
romp
in
which
the
girls
might
have
a
share
so
stage
coach
buff
and
similar
games
were
in
vogue
they
had
been
very
merry
and
entirely
harmonious
but
at
length
a
slight
dispute
arose
and
capt
raymond
sitting
in
an
adjoining
room
conversing
with
the
older
guests
and
members
of
the
family
yet
not
inattentive
to
what
was
going
on
among
the
young
folks
heard
voice
raised
to
a
higher
than
its
ordinary
key
he
rose
stepped
to
the
communicating
door
and
called
in
a
low
tone
grave
but
kindly
lulu
sir
she
answered
turning
her
face
in
his
direction
come
here
daughter
he
said
i
want
you
she
obeyed
promptly
though
evidently
a
trifle
unwillingly
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
out
into
the
hall
and
on
into
a
small
reception
room
bright
and
cheery
with
light
and
fire
but
quite
deserted
what
do
you
want
me
for
papa
she
asked
please
do
keep
me
long
because
we
were
just
going
to
begin
a
new
game
he
took
possession
of
an
easy
chair
and
drawing
her
into
his
arms
and
touching
his
lips
to
her
cheek
can
you
not
spare
a
few
minutes
to
your
father
when
your
mates
have
had
you
all
day
he
asked
why
yes
indeed
you
dear
papa
she
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
putting
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
looking
up
into
his
face
with
eyes
full
of
ardent
filial
affection
how
nice
in
you
to
love
me
well
enough
to
want
to
leave
the
company
in
the
parlors
to
give
a
little
time
to
petting
me
i
love
you
full
well
enough
for
that
my
darling
he
said
repeating
his
caresses
but
my
call
to
you
was
because
a
tone
in
my
little
voice
told
me
she
needed
her
father
just
at
that
moment
she
looked
up
inquiringly
then
with
sudden
comprehension
oh
you
thought
i
was
in
danger
of
getting
into
a
passion
and
i
afraid
i
was
papa
you
are
my
good
guardian
angel
always
on
the
watch
to
help
me
in
my
hard
fight
with
my
dreadful
temper
thank
you
very
very
much
you
are
entirely
welcome
daughter
he
said
softly
smoothing
her
hair
it
could
hardly
be
a
sadder
thing
to
you
than
to
me
should
that
enemy
of
yours
succeed
in
overcoming
you
again
try
dear
child
to
be
constantly
on
the
watch
against
it
ye
and
pray
lest
ye
enter
into
temptation
jesus
said
the
moment
that
you
feel
the
rising
of
anger
in
your
breast
lift
up
your
heart
to
him
for
strength
to
resist
i
do
intend
to
always
papa
she
sighed
tightening
her
clasp
of
his
neck
and
laying
her
cheek
to
his
but
oh
it
is
so
so
easy
to
forget
i
know
it
dear
child
but
i
can
only
encourage
you
to
continue
the
fight
with
your
evil
nature
looking
ever
unto
jesus
for
help
press
forward
in
the
heavenly
way
and
if
you
fall
get
up
again
and
go
on
with
redoubled
energy
and
determination
and
you
will
win
the
victory
at
last
for
all
these
things
we
are
more
than
conquerors
through
him
that
loved
us
now
if
you
feel
that
you
are
safe
in
doing
so
you
may
go
back
to
your
mates
there
was
a
very
sweet
expression
on
lulu
face
as
she
rejoined
her
mates
and
her
manner
was
gentle
and
subdued
so
you
come
back
remarked
sydney
what
did
your
papa
want
with
you
o
syd
exclaimed
rosie
that
private
you
know
oh
to
be
sure
i
beg
pardon
lu
said
sydney
you
are
quite
excusable
returned
lulu
pleasantly
papa
had
something
to
say
to
me
that
was
all
and
she
glanced
up
at
him
with
such
a
loving
look
as
at
that
instant
he
entered
the
room
that
no
one
could
suspect
the
talk
between
them
had
been
other
than
most
pleasant
well
you
have
come
back
just
in
time
we
are
going
to
play
the
game
of
authors
said
herbert
beginning
to
distribute
the
cards
the
words
had
hardly
left
his
lips
when
a
sharp
tap
at
the
window
made
them
all
jump
then
a
woman
voice
spoke
in
piteous
accents
oh
let
me
in
good
people
my
baby
and
i
are
starving
to
death
and
freezing
in
this
bitter
winter
wind
oh
who
is
it

is
it
cried
several
of
the
girls
sending
frightened
glances
in
the
direction
from
which
the
voice
had
come
i
soon
see
said
harold
hurrying
toward
the
window
but
a
gruff
voice
spoke
from
the
hall
do
mind
her
sir
she
a
gypsy
liar
and
thief
she
stole
the
baby
from
its
mother
harold
paused
stood
uncertainly
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
for
an
instant
then
turning
quickly
retraced
his
steps
went
to
the
hall
door
and
glanced
this
way
and
that
there
is
no
one
here
he
said
then
burst
into
a
laugh
as
turning
round
once
more
he
perceived
lilburn
quietly
seated
near
the
open
door
into
the
adjoining
parlor
where
the
older
people
were
cousin
ronald
may
i
ask

of

gypsy
and
the

uncle
harold
her
voice
did
sound
so
very
real
what

the
matter
gracie
dear
asked
a
sweet
voice
as
a
beautiful
lady
came
swiftly
from
the
adjoining
parlor
and
laid
her
soft
white
hand
on
the
little
girl
head
o
grandma
elsie

heard
a

time

the
occupants
of

crowding
into
this
captain

travilla
replied
in
a
kindly
indulgent
tone
harold
at
once
stepped
to
the
window
drew
back
the
curtains
raised
the
sash
and
threw
open
the
shutters
giving
a
full
view
of
all
the
grounds
on
that
side
of
the
house
for
the
clouds
had
cleared
away
and
the
moon
was
shining
down
on
snowladen
trees
and
shrubs
and
paths
and
parterres
carpeted
with
the
same
but
no
living
creature
was
to
be
seen
grace
holding
fast
to
her
father
hand
ventured
close
to
the
window
and
sent
searching
glances
from
side
to
side
then
with
a
sigh
of
relief
said
yes
i
do
believe
it
was
only
cousin
ronald
and
i
ever
so
glad
the
woman
and
her
baby

at

everybody
laughed
and
timid
sensitive

grace
hid
her
blushing
face
on
her
father
shoulder
as
he
sat
down
and
drew
her
to
his
side
never
mind
darling
he
said
soothingly
passing
an
arm
affectionately
about
her
and
softly
smoothing
her
curls
with
his
other
hand
it
is
good
natured
amusement

toward

not
very
polite
or
kind

innocent
speech
said
grandma
elsie
at
that
instant
the

and
smile
up
into

rewarded

i
trust
he
will
always
be
ready
to
do
so
when
such
an
avowal
is
called
for
as
long
as
he
lives
yes
indeed
sir
it
the
most
beautiful
flag
that
waves
is
it
none
to
compare
to
it
in
my
esteem
his
father
answered
with
a
pleased
laugh
chapter
ix
before
morning
the
weather
had
moderated
very
much
a
thaw
had
set
in
and
the
snow
was
going
rapidly
well
what
sports
shall
we
contrive
for
asked
herbert
at
the
breakfast
table
certainly
both
skating
and
snow
fights
are
entirely
out
of
the
question
entirely
echoed
harold
all
other
outdoor
sports
also
for
a
drizzling
rain
is
beginning
to
fall
and
the
melting
snow
has
covered
roads
and
paths
with
several
inches
of
water
we
have
some
games
for
the
house
which
you
have
not
tried
yet
said
their
mother
croquet
quoits
ring
toss
and
others
and
i
have
a
new
game
that
papa
gave
me
this
christmas
flags
of
all
nations
remarked
lulu
i
brought
it
with
me
we
will
be
glad
to
see
it
said
harold
it
is
probably
improving
as
well
as
entertaining
remarked
zoe
i
should
judge
so
from
the
name
i
think
you
will
find
it
both
said
the
captain
so
you
would
and
beans
too
aunt
zoe
said
max
papa
gave
it
to
me
and
we
tried
it
christmas
eve
at
home
and
found
it
very
funny
the
morning
and
most
of
the
afternoon
were
occupied
with
these
games
which
seemed
to
afford
much
enjoyment
to
the
children
and
young
people
it
was
the
winding
up
of
their
christmas
festivities
at
ion
and
all
were
in
the
mood
for
making
it
as
gay
and
mirthful
as
possible
some
the
raymonds
among
others
would
leave
shortly
after
tea
the
rest
by
or
before
bedtime
they
finished
the
sports
of
the
afternoon
with
two
charades
the
older
people
were
the
spectators
the
younger
ones
the
actors
mendicant
was
the
word
chosen
for
the
first
a
number
of
the
boys
and
girls
came
trooping
into
the
parlor
each
carrying
an
old
garment
thimble
on
finger
and
needle
and
thread
in
hand
seating
themselves
they
fell
to
work
zoe
was
patching
an
old
coat
lulu
an
apron
gracie
a
doll
dress
eva
and
rosie
each
had
a
worn
stocking
drawn
over
her
hand
and
was
busily
engaged
in
darning
it
the
other
girls
were
mending
gloves
the
boys
old
shoes
and
as
they
worked
they
talked
among
themselves
zoe
said
maud
i
should
mend
that
coat
differently
how
would
you
mend
it
asked
zoe
with
a
patch
much
larger
than
that
you
are
sewing
on
it
i
should
mend
it
that
way
remarked
sydney
i
darn
it
thank
you
both
for
your
very
kind
and
disinterested
advice
sniffed
zoe
but
i
learned
how
to
mend
before
i
ever
saw
you
and
i
should
mend
those
gloves
in
a
better
way
than
you
are
taking
if
you
know
so
well
how
to
mend
madam
zoe
will
you
please
give
me
some
instruction
about
mending
this
shoe
said
herbert
cobbling
is
not
in
my
line
neither
is
it
in
mine
sir
herbert
she
returned
drawing
herself
up
with
a
lofty
air
such
silly
pride
they
should
mend
their
ways
if
not
their
garments
remarked
maud
in
a
scornful
aside
one
should
think
it
beneath
her
to
mend
even
a
worn
stocking
said
rosie
no
responded
eva
and
she
should
mend
it
well
your
first
syllable
is
not
hard
to
guess
children
said
dinsmore
evidently
it
is
mend
with
that
the
actors
withdrew
and
presently
chester
dinsmore
returned
alone
marching
in
and
around
the
room
with
head
erect
and
pompous
air
his
clothes
were
of
fine
material
and
fashionable
cut
he
wore
handsome
jewelry
sported
a
gold
headed
cane
and
strutted
to
and
fro
gazing
about
him
with
an
air
of
lofty
disdain
as
of
one
who
felt
himself
superior
to
all
upon
whom
his
glances
fell
harold
presently
followed
him
into
the
room
he
was
dressed
as
a
country
swain
came
in
with
modest
diffident
air
and
for
a
while
stood
watching
chester
curiously
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
apartment
then
crossing
over
he
stood
before
him
hat
in
hand
and
bowing
low
sir
he
said
respectfully
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
if
you
are
anybody
in
particular
i
from
the
country
and
should
like
to
meet
any
great
man
and
not
know
it
i
sir
cried
chester
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
swelling
with
importance
i
i
am
the
greatest
man
in
america
the
greatest
man
of
the
age
i
am
smith
sir
the
inventor
of
the
most
delicious
ices
and
confectionery
ever
eaten
thank
you
sir
returned
harold
with
another
low
bow
i
shall
always
be
proud
and
happy
to
have
met
so
great
a
man
laughter
clapping
of
hands
and
cries
of
i
i
among
the
spectators
as
the
two
withdrew
by
way
of
the
hall
soon
the
young
actors
flocked
in
again
a
book
lay
on
a
table
quite
near
the
edge
with
a
sudden
jerk
herbert
threw
it
on
the
floor
rosie
picked
it
up
and
replaced
it
saying
ca
you
let
things
alone
rosie
why
ca
you
let
the
poor
boy
alone
whined
her
cousin
lora
howard
no

has
ever
known
me
to

an
exhibition

positively
wicked

bit
asked
harold
i
auction

these
goods
unless
you
are
attending
and
ready
with
your
bids
setting
down
a
basket
he
had
brought
in
with
him
he
took
an
article
from
it
and
held
it
high
in
air
we
have
here
an
elegant
lace
veil
worth
perhaps
a
hundred
dollars
it
is
to
be
sold
now
to
the
highest
bidder
somebody
give
us
a
bid
for
this
beautiful
piece
of
costly
lace
likely
to
go
for
a
tithe
of
its
real
value
one
dollar
said
rosie
one
dollar
indeed
we
could
never
afford
to
let
it
go
at
so
low
a
figure
we
ca
sell
this
elegant
and
desirable
article
of

so
ridiculously
low

said
maud

costly

cried
the
auctioneer
holding
it
higher
still
and
waving
it
to
and
fro
who
bids
higher
it
is
worth
ten
times
that
paltry
sum

be
dirt
cheap

ca
exclaimed
several
of
the
audience
as
the
veil
was
handed
to
zoe
and
the
whole
company
of
players
retired
they
shortly
returned
all
dressed
in
shabby
clothing
some
with
wallets
on
their
backs
some
with
old
baskets
on
their
arms
an
unmistakable
troop
of
beggars
passing
round
among
the
spectators
with
whining
petitions
for
cold
victuals
and
pennies
a
low
growl
instantly
followed
by
a
loud
fierce
bark
startled
players
and
spectators
alike
and
called
forth
a
slight
scream
from
some
of
the
little
ones
that
auld
dog
o
mine
always
barks
at
sic
a
troop
o
mendicants
remarked
cousin
ronald
quietly
i
ken
mendicant
the
word
lads
and
lasses
and
ye
hae
acted
it
out
wi
commendable
ingenuity
and
success
you
could
have
made
a
better
guess
if
you
had
belonged
to
the
universal
yankee
nation
cousin
laughed
herbert
they
retired
again
and
in
a
few
minutes
eva
and
lulu
came
in
dressed
in
travelling
attire
each
with
a
satchel
in
her
hand
this
must
be
the
place
i
think
said
eva
glancing
from
side
to
side
but
there
seems
to
be
no
one
in
they
may
be
in
directly
said
lulu
let
us
sit
down
and
rest
in
these
comfortable
looking
chairs
while
we
wait
they
seated
themselves
and
as
they
did
so
zoe
and
maud
walked
in
they
too
were
dressed
as
travelers
and
carried
satchels
the
four
shook
hands
zoe
remarking
so
you
got
in
here
before
us
how
did
you
come
in
the
stage
answered
lulu
ah
one
travels
so
slowly
in
that
we
came
in
the
cars
said
maud
yes
said
zoe
in
the
train
that
just
passed
let
us
go
back
in
the
cars
lu
said
eva
yes
in
the
same
train
they
take
oh
who
is
this
coming
he
acts
like
a
crazy
man
as
frank
dinsmore
entered
gesticulating
wildly
rolling
his
eyes
and
acting
altogether
very
much
like
a
madman
chester
was
following
close
at
his
heels
do
be
alarmed
ladies
he
said
he
shall
not
harm
you
i
take
care
of
that
i
have
my
eye
on
him
all
the
time
never
let
him
out
of
my
sight
i
am
his
keeper
but
he
dangerous
is
he
they
asked
shrinking
from
approach
as
if
in
great
fear
not
while
i
am
close
at
hand
said
chester
i
see
that
he
disturbs
no
one
i
think
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
go
now
girls
said
zoe
let
us
ask
the
driver
of
that
stage
to
take
us
in
then
we
be
safe
from
this
lunatic
they
hurried
out
and
in
another
minute
chester
and
frank
followed
then
edward
came
in
walked
up
to
the
fire
and
stood
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
in
seemingly
thoughtful
mood
but
as
the
lady
travelers
again
appeared
at
the
door
he
started
and
went
forward
to
receive
them
walk
in
ladies
he
said
walk
into
the
parlor
pray
be
seated
handing
them
chairs
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
you
are
the
innkeeper
asked
zoe
at
your
service
madam
do
you
wish
a
room
or
rooms
yes
we
will
have
two
and
let
them
be
adjoining
if
possible
certainly
madam
we
can
accommodate
you
in
that
and
will
be
happy
to
do
so
then
turning
to
the
spectators
can
you
tell
us
our
word
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
asked
innkeeper
was
the
prompt
response
from
several
voices
quite
correct
he
said
then
with
a
sweeping
bow
this
closes
our
entertainment
for
the
evening
and
with
many
thanks
for
their
kind
attention
we
bid
our
audience
a
grateful
adieu
half
an
hour
later
tea
was
served
and
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
the
guests
began
to
take
their
departure
the
family
separated
for
the
night
earlier
than
usual
but
harold
and
herbert
followed
their
mother
to
her
asking
if
she
felt
too
weary
for
a
little
chat
with
them
not
at
all
she
said
with
her
own
sweet
smile
i
know
of
nothing
that
would
afford
me
greater
satisfaction
than
one
of
the
oldtime
motherly
talks
with
my
dear
college
boys
so
come
in
my
dears
and
let
us
have
it
harold
drew
forward
an
easy
chair
for
her
but
she
declined
it
no
i
will
sit
on
the
sofa
so
that
i
can
have
you
close
to
me
one
on
each
side
she
said
that
will
suit
your
boys
exactly
mamma
if
you
will
be
quite
as
comfortable
said
herbert
placing
a
hassock
for
her
feet
as
she
seated
herself
quite
she
returned
giving
a
hand
to
each
as
they
placed
themselves
beside
her
now
remember
that
your
mother
will
be
glad
of
your
confidence
in
everything
that
concerns
you
great
or
small
nothing
that
interests
you
or
affects
your
happiness
in
the
very
least
can
fail
to
have
an
interest
for
her
we
know
it
dearest
mamma
said
harold
and
are
most
happy
in
the
assurance
that
such
is
the
fact
yes
assented
herbert
lifting
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
it
is
that
which
makes
a
private
chat
with
our
mother
so
great
a
delight
that
and
our
mutual
love
mamma
dear
i
can
not
believe
i
shall
ever
meet
another
woman
who
will
seem
to
me
at
all
comparable
to
my
dearly
loved
and
honored
mother
such
words
from
the
lips
of
my
son
are
very
sweet
to
my
ear
she
responded
a
tender
light
shining
in
her
eyes
and
yet
for
your
own
sake
i
hope
you
are
mistaken
i
would
have
all
my
children
know
the
happiness
to
be
found
in
married
life
where
mutual
admiration
esteem
and
love
are
so
great
that
the
two
are
as
one
such
a
marriage
as
yours
mamma
yes
there
could
not
be
a
happier
but
i
am
looking
far
ahead
for
my
college
boys
she
added
with
a
smile
at
least
i
trust
so
for
you
are
over
young
yet
to
be
looking
for
life
partners
i
do
think
either
of
us
has
begun
on
that
thus
far
mamma
said
harold
at
present
we
are
more
solicitous
to
decide
the
important
question
what
shall
our
principal
life
work
be
and
in
that
we
desire
the
help
of
our
mother
counsel
and
to
follow
her
wishes
it
is
a
question
of
very
great
importance
she
said
for
your
success
and
usefulness
in
life
will
depend
very
largely
upon
your
finding
the
work
your
heavenly
father
intends
you
to
do
and
for
which
you
are
best
fitted
by
the
talents
he
has
given
you
but
i
thought
you
had
both
decided
upon
the
medical
profession
and
i
was
well
content
with
your
choice
for
it
is
a
most
noble
and
useful
calling
so
we
thought
mamma
but
recently
our
hearts
have
been
so
moved
at
thought
of
the
millions
perishing
for
lack
of
a
saving
knowledge
of
christ
that
it
has
become
a
momentous
question
with
each
of
us
whether
he
is
called
to
preach
the
gospel
especially
in
the
at
home
or
abroad
her
eyes
shone
through
glad
tears
my
dear
boy
she
said
with
emotion
to
have
sons
in
the
ministry
i
should
esteem
the
greatest
honor
that
could
be
put
upon
me
for
there
can
be
no
higher
calling
than
that
of
an
ambassador
for
christ
no
grander
work
than
that
of
winning
souls
so
we
both
think
said
herbert
and
mamma
you
are
willing
we
should
go
and
labor
wherever
we
may
be
called
in
the
providence
of
god
yes
oh
yes
you
are
more
his
than
mine
i
dedicated
you
to
his
service
even
before
you
were
born
and
many
times
afterward
i
would
not
dare
stand
in
your
way
nor
would
i
wish
to
for
dearly
as
i
love
you
both
sweet
as
your
presence
is
to
me
i
am
more
than
willing
to
deny
myself
the
joy
of
having
you
near
me
for
the
sake
of
the
master
cause
and
that
you
may
win
the
reward
of
those
to
whom
he
will
say
at
the
last
done
good
and
faithful
servant
enter
thou
into
the
joy
of
the
lord
are
you
particularly
drawn
to
the
foreign
field
no
mamma
answered
harold
the
cause
is
one
field
is
the
world
but
while
we
are
deeply
interested
in
foreign
missions
and
desirous
to
do
all
we
can
to
help
there
we
feel
that
their
prosperity
depends
upon
the
success
of
the
work
at
home
and
that
the
cause
of
home
missions
is
the
cause
of
our
country
also
for
that
cause
we
would
labor
and
give
as
both
patriots
and
christians
look
at
the
dangers
threatening
our
dear
native
land
and
the
cause
of
christ
also
from
vice
and
illiteracy
popery
and
mormonism
all
ever
on
the
increase
from
the
rapid
influx
of
undesirable
immigrants
paupers
insane
anarchists
criminals
ah
how
surely
and
speedily
they
will
sweep
away
our
liberties
both
civil
and
religious
unless
we
rouse
ourselves
and
put
forth
every
energy
to
prevent
it
never
a
truer
saying
than
that
vigilance
is
the
price
of
liberty
and
nothing
can
secure
it
to
us
but
the
instruction
and
evangelization
of
these
dangerous
classes
is
it
not
so
mamma
yes
she
assented
i
am
satisfied
that
the
gospel
of
christ
is
the
only
remedy
for
those
threatening
evils
the
only
safeguard
of
our
liberties
as
well
as
the
only
salvation
for
a
lost
and
ruined
world
and
my
dear
boys
if
you
devote
yourselves
to
that
work
it
shall
be
your
mother
part
your
mother
joy
to
provide
the
means
for
your
support
i
can
not
go
into
the
work
myself
so
the
sending
of
my
sons
and
supporting
them
while
they
labor
must
be
my
contribution
to
the
cause
but
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
give
up
the
idea
of
studying
medicine
since
so
many
medical
missionaries
are
needed
my
plan
would
be
to
prepare
you
for
both
preaching
and
practising
if
you
have
talent
for
both
we
have
thought
of
that
said
harold
and
as
you
approve
dearest
mamma
we
will
hope
to
carry
it
out
i
am
so
glad
mamma
that
you
have
large
means
and
the
heart
to
use
them
in
the
work
of
spreading
abroad
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
through
christ
herbert
remarked
yes
she
said
it
is
both
a
responsibility
and
a
privilege
to
be
entrusted
with
so
much
of
my
lord
money
pray
for
your
mother
my
dear
boys
that
she
may
have
grace
and
wisdom
to
dispense
it
aright
we
will
mamma
we
do
and
oh
how
often
we
rejoice
in
having
a
mother
to
whom
we
can
confidently
apply
in
behalf
of
a
good
object
you
have
many
times
given
us
the
joy
of
relieving
misery
and
providing
instruction
for
the
ignorant
and
depraved
it
has
been
a
joy
to
me
to
be
able
to
do
so
she
said
thoughtfully
yet
i
fear
i
have
not
denied
myself
as
i
ought
for
the
sake
of
giving
largely
mamma
you
have
always
given
largely
since
i
have
been
old
enough
to
understand
anything
about
such
matters
interrupted
harold
warmly
yes
very
largely
if
every
one
had
given
and
would
give
as
largely
in
proportion
to
means
remarked
herbert
the
lord
treasury
would
be
full
to
overflowing
is
it
not
so
harold
surely
and
mamma
has
never
been
one
to
spend
unnecessarily
on
herself
replied
harold
fondly
caressing
the
hand
he
held
it
has
been
my
endeavor
to
be
a
faithful
steward
she
sighed
and
yet
i
might
have
given
more
than
i
have
i
have
been
giving
only
of
my
income
i
could
give
some
of
the
principal
and
i
have
a
good
many
valuable
jewels
that
might
be
turned
into
money
for
the
lord
treasury
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
about
that
of
late
and
have
talked
with
my
daughters
in
regard
to
the
matter
i
thought
it
but
right
to
consult
with
them
because
the
jewels
would
be
a
part
of
their
inheritance
and
i
wish
you
two
to
have
some
say
about
it
also
as
fellow
heirs
with
them
she
paused
and
both
lads
answered
quickly
that
they
thought
the
jewels
should
all
go
to
their
sisters
no
you
and
your
future
wives
should
have
a
share
also
she
replied
smilingly
that
is
if
i
retained
them
all
and
that
being
understood
are
you
willing
to
have
most
of
them
disposed
of
and
the
proceeds
used
in
aid
of
home
and
foreign
missions
both
gave
a
hearty
assent
thank
you
my
dears
she
said
and
now
having
already
consulted
with
your
grandfather
and
older
brother
winning
their
consent
and
approval
i
consider
the
matter
settled
a
few
of
my
jewels
dear
to
me
as
mementoes
of
the
past
i
shall
retain
also
a
few
others
which
would
not
sell
for
nearly
what
they
are
really
worth
to
us
but
the
rest
i
intend
to
have
sold
and
the
money
used
for
the
spread
of
the
gospel
in
our
own
and
heathen
lands
i
am
convinced
you
could
not
make
a
better
investment
mamma
harold
said
his
eyes
shining
with
pleasure
yes
you
are
right
she
returned
it
is
an
investment
one
that
can
not
possibly
fail
to
give
a
grand
return
for
does
he
not
say
that
hath
pity
upon
the
poor
lendeth
to
the
lord
and
that
which
he
hath
given
will
he
pay
him
again
who
was
it
dean
swift
if
i
remember
aright
who
preached
a
charity
sermon
from
that
text
you
like
the
security
down
with
the
dust
and
you
do
like
the
security
mamma
you
prefer
it
to
any
other
i
am
quite
sure
said
herbert
but
what
a
fine
specimen
of
a
charity
sermon
that
was
both
powerful
and
brief
doubtless
many
of
the
hearers
were
greatly
relieved
that
they
had
not
to
listen
to
a
long
dull
harangue
on
the
subject
and
all
the
more
disposed
to
give
liberally
on
that
account
yes
do
not
forget
to
act
upon
that
idea
when
your
turn
comes
to
preach
a
sermon
on
that
subject
harold
said
giving
his
younger
brother
a
mischievous
smile
and
let
us
not
forget
the
lesson
of
the
text
when
the
appeal
comes
to
us
added
their
mother
oh
my
dear
boys
what
a
privilege
it
is
to
be
permitted
to
make
such
investments
and
to
be
sowers
of
the
good
seed
whether
by
personal
effort
or
in
providing
the
means
for
sending
out
others
as
laborers
let
us
endeavor
to
be
of
the
number
of
those
who
sow
largely
in
both
ways
for
which
soweth
sparingly
shall
reap
also
sparingly
and
he
that
soweth
bountifully
shall
reap
also
bountifully
and
the
harvest
is
sure
at
the
end
of
the
world
if
not
sooner
and
whether
we
give
in
one
way
or
the
other
let
us
not
do
it
or
of
necessity
but
joyfully
and
with
all
our
hearts
for
god
loveth
a
cheerful
giver
mamma
said
harold
earnestly
we
do
both
feel
it
a
great
and
blessed
privilege
to
be
permitted
to
be
with
god
for
the
advancement
of
his
cause
and
kingdom
with
that
the
conversation
turned
upon
other
themes
but
presently
the
boys
kissed
the
dear
mother
good
night
and
withdrew
lest
they
should
rob
her
of
needed
rest
chapter
x
home
again
and
it
nice
to
get
home
exclaimed
lulu
skipping
up
the
steps
of
the
veranda
and
across
into
the
wide
hall
where
all
was
light
and
warmth
and
beauty
violet
and
grace
had
preceded
her
and
her
father
was
following
with
little
elsie
in
his
arms
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
glad
my
daughter
appreciates
her
home
he
said
in
a
cheery
tone
i
be
a
queer
girl
papa
if
i
did
appreciate
such
a
home
as
this
is
she
returned
with
warmth
and
smiling
up
into
his
face
do
you
say
so
max
catching
sight
of
her
brother
who
riding
his
pony
had
arrived
some
minutes
ahead
of
the
carriage
and
was
now
petting
and
fondling
his
dog
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
yes
indeed
he
answered
i
think
if
we
were
happy
and
contented
in
this
home
we
ought
to
have
any
at
all
papa
prince
is
a
splendid
fellow
stroking
and
patting
the
dog
head
as
he
spoke
so
i
think
said
the
captain
and
i
too
said
violet
he
is
a
very
acceptable
addition
to
the
family
my
dear
home
does
look
exceedingly
attractive
to
me
as
well
as
to
the
children
but
little
elsie
eyes
are
closing
mamma
must
see
her
babies
to
bed
i
wonder
where
my
pussy
is
grace
was
saying
from
the
library
door
i
thought
she
be
lying
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
here
like
she
was
the
other
night
but
she
is
oh
and
my
polly
cried
lulu
is
she
in
there
i
will
carry
elsie
to
the
nursery
my
love
said
the
captain
lulu
and
gracie
you
may
perhaps
find
your
pets
in
your
own
little
sitting
room
oh
yes
they
cried
in
chorus
and
started
up
the
stairs
after
their
father
and
violet
outside
the
night
was
cold
but
within
the
house
the
atmosphere
was
that
of
summer
doors
stood
open
and
in
the
halls
and
the
rooms
used
by
the
family
lights
were
burning
also
the
air
was
sweet
and
fragrant
with
a
faint
odor
of
roses
heliotrope
and
mignonette
coming
from
the
conservatory
and
from
vases
of
cut
flowers
placed
here
and
there
all
the
result
of
capt
raymond
kind
forethought
for
the
comfort
and
pleasure
of
wife
and
children
and
the
careful
carrying
out
of
his
orders
by
the
faithful
housekeeper
christine
no
wonder
home
looked
so
attractive
to
its
returning
occupants
even
coming
from
a
former
one
quite
as
beautiful
and
luxurious
oh
how
sweet
it
does
look
here
exclaimed
both
the
little
girls
as
they
entered
their
little
oh
and
there
is
my
pussy
lying
on
the
rug
all
curled
up
like
a
soft
round
ball
added
grace
you
are
having
a
nice
nap
pretty
kitty
and
i
do
mean
to
wake
you
but
i
must
pet
you
just
a
little
bit
dropping
down
beside
her
and
gently
stroking
the
soft
fur
and
there
my
polly
in
her
cage
and
fast
asleep
too
i
do
believe
said
lulu
i
want
ever
so
much
to
hear
her
talk
but
i
be
as
good
to
her
as
you
are
to
your
pet
gracie
i
wo
wake
her
now
we
must
take
off
our
things
gracie
for
you
know
papa
always
says
we
must
keep
them
on
in
the
house
and
that
we
must
put
them
away
in
their
places
yes
but
i
so
tired
papa
would
let
me
wait
a
minute
of
course
you
poor
little
weak
thing
i
take
them
off
for
you
and
put
them
away
too
and
you
need
hardly
more
lulu
said
hastily
throwing
off
her
own
coat
and
hat
then
kneeling
on
the
rug
beside
her
sister
she
began
undoing
the
fastenings
of
her
coat
dear
lu
you
just
as
good
to
me
as
can
be
sighed
grace
in
tender
grateful
accents
i
really
do
know
what
i
ever
do
without
my
nice
big
sister
somebody
else
would
take
care
of
you
said
lulu
flushing
with
pleasure
nevertheless
there
now
i
go
and
put
both
our
things
in
their
right
places
when
she
came
back
she
found
grace
brimming
over
with
delight
because
the
kitten
had
waked
crept
into
her
lap
and
curled
itself
up
there
for
another
nap
o
lu
just
see
she
cried
i
do
believe
she
fond
of
me
is
it
nice
yes
very
nice
but
you
burning
your
face
before
that
bright
fire
oh
you
do
need
your
big
sister
to
take
care
of
you
lifting
a
screen
in
between
grace
and
the
glowing
grate
then
seating
herself
on
a
hassock
now
put
your
head
in
my
lap
and
stretch
yourself
out
on
the
rug
you
can
rest
nicely
that
way
and
have
a
good
talk
such
a
nice
big
soft
rug
as
this
is
i
should
think
it
must
have
taken
several
big
sheep
skins
to
make
it
and
it
was
so
good
in
papa
to
have
it
put
here
for
us
yes
indeed
our
dear
papa
how
i
do
love
him
he
always
doing
kind
things
to
us
yes
o
gracie
if
i
were
only
good
like
you
and
did
ever
do
and
say
naughty
things
that
make
him
feel
sad
sighed
lulu
oh
do
you
know
we
are
going
to
have
a
party
on
new
years
all
the
folks
that
were
at
ion

grown
up
ones
to

and
mamma
vi

and

we
all
to
go
to

a
rather

yes
but
i
think
i
like
being
at
home
the
best
of
all
why
did
you
enjoy
yourself
at
ion
yes
but
i
believe
i
a
little
bit
tired
now
tired
yes
of
being
with
so
many
folks
it
nice
for
a
while
but
after
that
it
sort
of
wears
me
out
and
i
glad
to
get
back
to
my
own
dear
home
where
i
can
be
just
as
quiet
as
ever
i
please
oh
there
is
papa
exclaimed
lulu
turning
her
head
and
seeing
him
standing
in
the
open
doorway
he
was
smiling
on
his
darlings
thinking
what
a
pretty
picture
they
made
the
little
slender
figure
on
the
rug
with
the
kitten
closely
cuddled
in
its
arms
the
golden
head
lying
in
lulu
lap
while
her
blooming
face
bent
tenderly
over
it
one
hand
toying
with
its
soft
ringlets
tired
gracie
my
pet
he
asked
coming
forward
and
stooping
to
scan
the
small
pale
face
in
loving
solicitude
only
a
little
dear
papa
she
answered
with
a
patient
smile
up
into
his
face
i
think
i
shall
be
quite
rested
by
morning
and
so
glad
we
at
home
again
yes
and
just
now
the
best
place
in
it
for
my
weary
little
girl
is
her
bed
lulu
and
i
will
get
you
there
as
soon
as
we
can
must
i
stay
up
for
prayers
no
darling
you
are
too
tired
and
sleepy
to
get
any
good
from
the
service
i
see
your
eyes
can
hardly
keep
themselves
open
i
believe
they
ca
and
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
go
right
to
my
nice
bed
she
returned
sleepily
pushing
the
kitten
gently
from
her
so
she
was
lifted
to
her
father
knee
and
lulu
sent
for
her
night
dress
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
resting
peacefully
in
her
bed
while
the
captain
and
lulu
went
down
hand
in
hand
to
the
library
where
they
found
max
sitting
alone
reading
he
closed
his
book
as
they
entered
rose
and
wheeled
an
easy
chair
nearer
the
fire
for
his
father
who
took
it
with
a
pleasant
thank
you
my
son
and
drew
lulu
to
a
seat
upon
his
knee
what
were
you
reading
max
he
asked
of
united
states
navy
for
boys
answered
the
lad
papa
would
you
be
willing
for
me
to
go
into
the
navy
if
you
have
a
strong
inclination
for
the
life
my
boy
i
shall
throw
no
obstacle
in
your
way
thank
you
sir
i
sometimes
think
i
should
like
it
yet
i
not
quite
sure
i
rather
be
there
than
anywhere
else
you
must
be
quite
sure
of
your
inclination
before
we
move
in
the
matter
returned
his
father
is
there
something
you
would
prefer
for
me
papa
asked
max
if
i
were
quite
sure
you
were
called
of
god
to
the
work
i
should
rather
see
you
a
preacher
of
the
gospel
an
ambassador
for
christ
than
anything
else
yet
if
you
lack
the
talent
or
consecration
you
would
better
be
out
of
the
ministry
than
in
it
i
glad
i
not
a
boy
and
do
have
to
go
away
from
home
and
papa
lulu
said
nestling
closer
in
her
father
arms
home
a
delightful
place
and
nobody
loves
to
be
with
papa
more
than
i
do
said
max
but
for
all
that
i
glad
i
going
to
be
a
man
and
able
to
do
a
man
work
in
the
world
and
i
said
the
captain
am
glad
that
god
has
given
me
both
sons
and
daughters
and
that
you
two
are
satisfied
to
be
what
god
has
made
you
for
some
moments
no
one
spoke
again
then
lulu
remarked
thoughtfully
this
is
the
last
saturday
and
will
be
the
last
sunday
of
the
old
year
papa
do
you
remember
the
talk
we
had
together
a
year
ago
on
the
last
sunday
of
that
year
yes
daughter
quite
well
and
now
it
is
time
for
another
retrospect
and
fresh
resolutions
to
try
to
live
better
by
the
help
of
him
who
is
the
strength
of
his
people
their
shield
and
helper
it
has
been
nearly
so
good
a
year
with
me
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
sighed
lulu
yet
an
improvement
upon
the
one
before
it
i
think
remarked
her
father
in
a
tone
of
encouragement
you
have
not
so
far
as
i
know
indulged
even
once
in
a
fit
of
violent
anger
and
knowing
my
little
girl
as
most
truthful
and
very
open
with
me
i
certainly
believe
that
if
she
had
been
in
a
passion
she
would
have
come
to
me
with
an
honest
confession
of
her
fault
i
sure
lu
would
said
max
and
i
do
think
she
has
improved
very
much
no
i
have
been
in
a
passion
papa
and
i
hope
if
i
had
i
have
been
deceitful
enough
to
try
to
hide
it
from
you
but
oh
i
been
very
very
naughty
two
or
three
times
in
other
ways
you
know
and
you
were
so
good
to
forgive
me
and
keep
on
loving
me
in
spite
of
it
all
dear
child
was
all
he
said
in
reply
accompanying
the
words
with
a
tender
caress
i
too
have
come
a
good
deal
short
of
my
resolves
observed
max
with
a
regretful
sigh
yet
i
suppose
we
have
both
done
better
than
we
should
if
we
had
made
good
resolutions
no
doubt
of
it
said
his
father
i
feel
it
to
be
so
in
my
case
though
i
too
have
fallen
far
short
of
the
standard
i
set
myself
but
shall
we
not
try
again
my
children
oh
yes
sir
yes
and
try
not
only
to
make
the
new
year
better
if
we
are
spared
to
see
it
but
also
the
three
remaining
days
of
the
old
yes
sighed
lulu
perhaps
i
may
get
into
a
dreadful
passion
yet
before
the
year
is
out
i
hope
not
daughter
her
father
said
but
watch
and
pray
for
only
so
can
you
be
safe
there
is
one
who
is
able
to
keep
you
from
falling
cling
close
to
him
like
the
limpet
to
the
rock
oh
i
will
she
replied
in
an
earnest
tone
but
papa
what
is
a
limpet
i
do
remember
ever
having
heard
of
it
before
it
is
a
of
which
there
are
numerous
species
exhibiting
great
variety
of
form
and
color
the
common
limpet
is
most
abundant
on
the
rocky
coasts
of
britain
they
live
on
the
rocks
between
low
and
high
tide
marks
they
move
about
when
the
water
covers
them
but
when
the
tide
is
out
remain
firmly
fixed
to
one
spot
so
firmly
that
unless
surprised
by
a
sudden
seizure
it
is
almost
impossible
to
drag
or
tear
them
from
the
rock
without
breaking
the
shell
how
can
they
hold
so
tight
asked
max
the
animal
has
a
round
or
oval
muscular
foot
by
which
it
clings
and
its
ability
to
do
so
is
increased
by
a
viscous
or
sticky
secretion
please
tell
some
more
about
them
papa
requested
lulu
looking
greatly
interested
have
they
mouths
and
do
you
know
what
they
eat
yes
they
have
mouths
and
they
live
on
seaweed
eating
it
by
means
of
a
long
tongue
covered
with
rows
of
hard
teeth
the
common
limpet
which
as
i
have
told
you
lives
on
the
british
coast
has
no
fewer
than
one
hundred
and
sixty
rows
twelve
teeth
in
a
row
how
many
does
that
make
max
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
answered
the
lad
after
a
thought
right
said
his
father
the
tongue
when
not
in
use
lies
folded
deep
in
the
interior
of
the
limpet
are
their
shells
pretty
papa
lulu
asked
those
of
some
of
the
limpets
of
warmer
climates
are
very
beautiful
he
answered
large
too
i
have
seen
them
on
the
western
coast
of
south
america
a
foot
wide
so
large
that
they
are
often
used
as
basins
oh
i
like
to
have
one
she
exclaimed
is
it
for
their
shells
people
try
to
pull
them
off
the
rocks
it
may
be
so
in
some
instances
but
the
limpet
is
used
for
food
and
also
as
bait
by
the
fisherman
try
my
children
to
remember
what
i
have
been
telling
you
about
it
but
most
of
all
let
your
thoughts
dwell
upon
the
lesson
to
be
drawn
from
its
close
clinging
to
the
rock
god
is
often
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
as
his
people
rock
because
he
is
their
strength
their
refuge
their
asylum
as
the
rocks
were
in
those
places
whither
the
children
of
israel
retired
in
case
of
an
unexpected
attack
from
their
foes
david
says
lord
is
my
rock
and
my
fortress
who
is
a
rock
save
our
god
jesus
is
the
rock
on
which
we
must
build
our
hope
of
salvation
any
other
foundation
will
be
as
the
sand
upon
which
the
foolish
man
built
his
house
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
and
great
was
the
fall
of
it
the
limpet
is
wiser
it
never
trusts
to
the
shifting
sand
but
holds
firmly
to
the
immovable
rock
be
like
it
in
resisting
all
attempts
whether
of
human
or
spiritual
foes
to
drag
you
from
your
rock
papa
said
max
slowly
and
with
some
hesitation
i
wish
to
do
so
i
think
it
is
my
settled
purpose
but
i
i
feel
afraid
that
sometime
i
may
let
go
i
a
careless
heedless
fellow
you
know
and
and
afraid
i
may
forget
to
hold
fast
to
jesus
and
be
overcome
by
some
sudden
and
great
temptation
there
is
danger
of
that
my
boy
the
captain
returned
with
feeling
yet
i
should
have
greater
fear
for
you
if
i
heard
you
talk
in
a
and
boasting
spirit
trusting
in
ourselves
we
are
not
safe
but
trusting
in
jesus
we
are
we
are
safe
only
while
we
cling
to
our
sure
foundation
the
rock
christ
jesus
but
our
greatest
security
is
in
the
joyful
fact
that
he
holds
us
fast
and
will
never
let
us
go
if
we
have
indeed
given
ourselves
to
him
he
says
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
i
know
them
and
they
follow
me
and
i
give
unto
them
eternal
life
and
they
shall
never
perish
neither
shall
any
man
pluck
them
out
of
my
hand
such
sweet
words
papa
are
they
lulu
said
softly
yes
words
that
have
been
an
untold
comfort
and
support
to
many
of
god
dear
children
on
their
way
zionward
the
sword
of
the
spirit
with
which
they
have
fought
satan
lying
assertion
that
they
might
yet
be
lost
in
spite
of
having
fled
for
refuge
to
him
who
died
on
calvary
is
it
those
words
the
bible
means
when
it
speaks
of
the
sword
of
the
spirit
papa
asked
max
not
those
alone
but
the
word
of
god
and
in
order
to
be
prepared
to
wield
that
sword
we
must
store
our
memories
with
the
word
we
must
hide
it
in
our
hearts
david
says
word
have
i
hid
in
mine
heart
that
i
might
not
sin
against
thee
christ
is
our
pattern
we
must
strive
to
follow
his
example
in
all
things
and
it
was
with
the
sword
of
the
spirit
he
repelled
every
temptation
of
the
devil
there
in
the
wilderness
beginning
each
reply
to
the
evil
suggestions
with
is
written
that
is
why
you
have
us
learn
so
many
bible
verses
papa
yes
open
the
bible
lying
on
the
table
there
max
and
turn
to
the
sixth
chapter
of
deuteronomy
max
did
so
then
read
by
his
father
direction
the
sixth
and
seventh
verses
and
these
words
which
i
command
thee
this
day
shall
be
in
thine
heart
and
thou
shalt
teach
them
diligently
unto
thy
children
and
shalt
talk
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way
and
when
thou
liest
down
and
when
thou
risest
up
i
think
you
obey
that
command
papa
said
lulu
indeed
i
think
you
try
to
obey
every
command
in
god
word
i
do
he
replied
and
i
want
my
children
to
follow
my
example
in
that
in
the
eleventh
chapter
of
the
same
book
the
command
is
repeated
and
these
words
are
added
your
days
may
be
multiplied
and
the
days
of
your
children
in
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
give
them
as
the
days
of
heaven
upon
the
earth
speaking
of
the
law
the
testimony
the
statutes
the
commandments
of
the
lord
the
psalmist
tells
us
that
keeping
of
them
there
is
great
reward
true
happiness
is
known
by
none
but
those
who
are
at
peace
with
god
but
living
in
the
light
of
his
countenance
one
may
be
full
of
joy
even
in
the
midst
of
great
earthly
tribulation
ah
my
darlings
i
can
wish
nothing
better
for
you
than
that
you
may
thus
live
at
that
moment
violet
joined
them
the
babies
were
unusually
wakeful
and
troublesome
she
remarked
but
have
at
last
fallen
asleep
and
so
released
mamma
from
attendance
upon
them
to
our
great
content
added
her
husband
gently
putting
lulu
off
his
knee
and
rising
to
give
his
wife
a
seat
while
max
sprang
up
and
gallantly
placed
a
chair
for
her
selecting
the
most
comfortable
and
placing
it
close
beside
his
father
she
thanked
him
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
the
captain
remarking
max
was
too
quick
for
me
that
time
like
his
father
he
is
extremely
polite
and
attentive
to
ladies
said
violet
how
cosy
you
are
here
and
you
two
children
have
been
having
a
pleasant
time
no
doubt
with
papa
all
to
yourselves
we
have
missed
you
my
dear
said
her
husband
at
least
i
may
speak
for
myself
and
would
have
been
glad
if
you
could
have
come
to
us
sooner
added
max
have
you
been
laying
plans
for
the
entertainment
of
our
expected
guests
who
are
to
keep
new
year
day
with
us
she
asked
no
my
dear
your
help
will
be
needed
in
that
replied
her
husband
ca
we
have
some
charades
again
asked
lulu
i
see
no
objection
answered
her
father
provided
something
new
can
be
thought
of
misunderstand
i
think
might
do
for
one
said
max
yes
max
i
think
that
might
be
very
good
violet
said
and
perhaps
madman
would
do
for
another
we
need
several
words
for
our
charades
i
think
said
lulu
and
a
number
for
the
sports
at
fairview
but
fortunately
we
are
not
responsible
for
the
entertainment
there
remarked
violet
pleasantly
no
said
the
captain
and
i
think
we
will
dismiss
thought
for
our
own
for
the
present
it
is
time
now
for
evening
worship
max
you
may
ring
for
the
servants
as
usual
the
captain
went
into
lulu
room
for
a
bit
of
good
night
chat
with
her
about
the
time
she
was
ready
for
bed
papa
she
said
nestling
close
in
his
arms
i
have
been
thinking
more
about
the
kind
of
year
this
has
been
to
me
and
oh
i
think
i
must
always
remember
it
as
a
good
one
because
in
it
i
have
learned
to
love
jesus
i
know
i
have
done
some
very
wrong
things
even
since
i
begun
to
try
to
be
his
servant
she
went
on
hanging
her
head
in
shame
and
contrition
but
o
papa
i
do
love
him
and
want
to
serve
him
all
my
life
how
glad
i
am
that
he
is
so
loving
and
forgiving
and
that
he
says
he
will
never
let
any
one
pluck
me
out
of
his
hand
yes
dear
child
it
is
a
most
precious
assurance
and
we
may
well
rejoice
in
it
you
and
i
and
all
his
people
but
ever
let
us
keep
in
mind
and
obey
those
other
words
of
our
blessed
master
and
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation
remember
that
we
are
to
be
good
soldiers
of
jesus
christ
and
that
we
have
a
great
battle
to
fight
with
the
evil
that
is
in
our
own
hearts
the
snares
of
the
world
and
the
powers
of
darkness
satan
and
his
hosts
of
wicked
spirits
whose
great
desire
and
aim
is
to
ruin
our
souls
and
drag
us
down
to
the
dreadful
place
prepared
for
them
papa
sometimes
i
feel
so
afraid
of
them
she
sighed
shuddering
but
jesus
is
stronger
than
any
of
them
and
will
not
let
them
hurt
me
if
i
trust
in
him
stronger
than
all
of
them
put
together
and
will
not
let
any
or
all
of
them
pluck
you
out
of
his
hand
we
are
safe
there
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
romans
we
find
these
triumphant
words
am
persuaded
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
principalities
nor
powers
nor
things
present
nor
things
to
come
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
other
creature
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
chapter
xi
in
all
the
homes
of
the
dinsmore
connection
sunday
was
always
a
peacefully
quiet
day
kept
as
a
sacred
time
of
rest
from
toil
and
worldly
cares
and
pleasures
the
quiet
and
leisure
for
thought
were
particularly
grateful
to
grandma
elsie
in
her
pleasant
home
at
ion
on
this
last
sunday
of
the
old
year
she
had
enjoyed
having
her
friends
about
her
and
seeing
the
hilarity
of
the
children
and
youth
she
was
still
youthful
in
her
feelings
and
full
of
an
ever
ready
sympathy
with
the
young
none
of
whom
could
know
without
loving
her
while
to
all
who
could
claim
kin
with
her
especially
her
children
and
grandchildren
she
was
an
object
of
devoted
affection
affection
fully
reciprocated
by
her
and
so
the
frequent
reunions
at
ion
were
a
source
of
delight
to
both
her
and
them
yet
there
were
times
when
her
spirit
craved
exclusive
companionship
with
her
nearest
and
dearest
other
seasons
when
she
would
be
alone
with
him
whom
her
soul
desired
above
all
earthly
joy
and
earthly
love
an
hour
had
been
spent
in
secret
communion
with
him
ere
rosie
and
walter
came
for
the
half
hour
of
bible
study
and
prayer
in
dressing
room
before
breakfast
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
since
their
earliest
recollection
and
not
they
only
but
their
older
brothers
and
sisters
before
them
every
one
of
whom
had
very
tender
memories
connected
with
that
short
service
memories
that
had
been
a
safeguard
to
them
in
times
of
temptation
a
comfort
and
support
in
the
dark
hours
that
sooner
or
later
come
to
all
the
sons
and
daughters
of
adam
and
made
them
feel
it
even
yet
a
privilege
to
participate
when
circumstances
would
permit
sometimes
edward
and
zoe
joined
the
little
circle
and
harold
and
herbert
seldom
failed
to
do
so
when
at
home
they
all
did
so
this
morning
and
with
an
enjoyment
that
made
the
allotted
time
seem
far
too
short
their
mother
had
always
been
able
to
interest
her
children
in
bible
lessons
breakfast
and
family
worship
followed
then
attendance
upon
the
morning
service
of
the
sanctuary
after
that
sunday
school
for
the
blacks
in
the
school
house
on
the
estate
the
mother
and
all
her
children
acting
as
teachers
the
afternoon
and
evening
were
given
to
reading
conversation
and
music
suited
to
the
sacredness
of
the
day
then
all
retired
to
peaceful
slumbers
from
which
they
rose
in
the
morning
rested
and
refreshed
in
body
and
mind
and
ready
to
enter
with
zest
upon
the
labors
and
pleasures
of
the
new
week
according
to
the
arrangements
made
the
previous
week
the
whole
ion
family
and
all
who
had
been
guests
there
at
that
time
repaired
to
fairview
at
an
early
hour
where
they
spent
the
day
together
in
social
festivities
similar
to
those
with
which
they
had
enlivened
their
stay
with
grandma
elsie
harold
and
herbert
gave
a
magic
lantern
exhibition
some
charades
were
acted
and
cousin
ronald
contrived
to
add
not
a
little
to
the
fun
by
timely
efforts
in
his
own
peculiar
line
the
very
little
ones
were
delighted
to
hear
their
toy
dogs
bark
roosters
crow
hens
and
geese
cackle
ducks
quack
horses
neigh
and
donkeys
bray
they
could
hardly
believe
that
the
sounds
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
mouths
of
the
toy
animals
were
really
made
by
cousin
ronald
and
when
assured
that
such
was
the
case
thought
him
a
most
wonderful
man
some
of
the
guests
departed
that
evening
but
others
remained
over
night
among
them
the
raymonds
on
tuesday
morning
they
went
home
to
woodburn
taking
grandma
elsie
rosie
walter
and
evelyn
leland
with
them
lulu
had
been
sharing
evelyn
room
at
fairview
and
now
was
to
have
the
pleasure
of
returning
the
hospitality
there
were
some
preparations
to
be
made
for
the
entertainment
of
guests
and
the
children
were
in
a
flutter
of
pleasurable
excitement
i
could
not
tell
you
how
much
they
enjoyed
their
share
of
the
planning
and
arranging
and
the
consultations
together
and
with
the
older
people
or
how
kindly
indulgent
the
captain
was
to
their
wishes
and
fancies
never
saying
them
nay
when
it
was
within
his
power
to
grant
their
request
evelyn
leland
loved
to
watch
lulu
and
grace
as
they
hung
affectionately
about
their
father
giving
and
receiving
caresses
and
endearments
yet
the
sight
often
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
calling
up
tender
memories
of
the
past
she
had
not
forgotten
she
never
could
forget
the
dear
parent
who
had
been
wo
to
lavish
such
caresses
and
endearments
upon
her
and
at
times
her
young
heart
ached
with
its
longing
to
hear
again
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
feel
the
clasp
of
his
arm
and
his
kisses
upon
cheek
and
lip
and
brow
yet
life
was
gliding
along
very
peacefully
and
happily
with
her
brightened
by
the
love
of
kindred
and
friends
and
she
could
join
very
heartily
in
the
diversions
and
merriment
of
her
companions
tea
was
over
the
babies
had
had
their
romp
with
papa
brothers
and
sisters
and
been
carried
off
to
the
nursery
leaving
the
rest
of
the
family
the
guests
included
in
the
pleasant
library
well
my
dears
it
has
been
a
busy
day
with
you
remarked
grandma
elsie
smiling
pleasantly
upon
the
group
of
children
but
i
presume
your
preparations
for
sports
are
quite
completed
yes
said
lulu
and
we
have
some
very
good
charades
mamma
said
rosie
and
have
arranged
for
some
nice
tableaux
new
ones
new
and
old
both
answered
rosie
and
lulu
together
and
oh
grandma
elsie
we
want
another
with
you
in
it
added
lulu
with
eager
entreaty
in
her
tones
and
why
with
me
my
dear
asked
travilla
with
a
pleased
little
laugh
are
there
not
more
than
enough
younger
people
to
take
part
oh
there
are
plenty
of
us
such
as
we
are
laughed
evelyn
but
we
want
all
the
beautiful
people
so
that
the
pictures
will
be
beautiful
you
are
coming
out
in
a
new
character
eva
that
of
an
adroit
flatterer
returned
grandma
elsie
with
a
look
of
amusement
but
i
am
not
at
all
displeased
my
dear
child
because
i
credit
it
entirely
to
your
affection
which
i
prize
very
highly
she
hastened
to
add
seeing
that
her
words
had
called
up
a
blush
of
painful
embarrassment
on
usually
placid
face
grandma
elsie
we
all
love
you
dearly
said
lulu
but
you
beautiful
i
sure
everybody
thinks
so
do
they
papa
as
far
as
my
knowledge
goes
he
answered
smiling
and
pinching
her
cheek
for
as
usual
she
was
close
at
his
side
and
indeed
i
do
know
how
any
one
could
think
otherwise
mamma
will
i
sure
said
walter
because
we
want
her
to
and
always
kind
will
what
asked
violet
coming
in
at
that
moment
be
one
in
a
tableau
replied
walter
yes
of
course
said
violet
oh
we
make
a
group
with
mamma
grandpa
sister
elsie
and
her
little
ned
and
call
it
a
picture
of
four
generations
if
dear
old
grandpa
were
with
us
still
we
could
make
it
five
a
very
nice
idea
my
dear
the
captain
remarked
with
a
glance
of
affectionate
admiration
at
his
young
wife
as
he
rose
and
handed
her
a
chair
and
i
think
we
must
have
the
group
photographed
oh
yes
lester
can
do
it
beautifully
we
send
him
word
to
bring
his
apparatus
with
him
yes
said
her
mother
and
we
will
ask
him
to
take
us
all
in
family
groups
the
pictures
will
be
pleasant
mementoes
of
this
holiday
season
mamma
said
walter
i
think
if
you
would
tell
us
all
about
all
the
new
years
days
you
can
remember
it
would
be
a
very
interesting
way
of
spending
the
evening
yes
mamma
we
would
all
be
charmed
to
hear
your
story
said
violet
the
others
chiming
in
with
oh
yes
mamma
yes
grandma
elsie
please
do
tell
it
since
you
all
seem
to
desire
it
i
will
try
she
answered
kindly
but
i
fear
my
reminiscences
will
hardly
deserve
the
name
of
story
the
first
christmas
and
new
years
of
which
i
retain
a
vivid
remembrance
were
those
of
the
first
winter
after
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
my
dear
father
for
as
i
believe
you
all
know
i
never
saw
him
till
i
was
eight
years
old
the
occurrences
of
that
christmas
are
too
familiar
to
most
if
not
all
of
you
to
bear
repetition
and
you
had
at
all
a
nice
new
year
that
time
mamma
said
rosie
softly
stroking
and
patting
the
hand
she
held
then
lifting
it
to
her
lips
for
she
was
sitting
on
a
stool
at
her
mother
feet
while
the
others
had
grouped
themselves
around
her
suffering
so
with
that
sprained
ankle
ah
there
you
are
mistaken
my
child
grandma
elsie
answered
with
her
own
sweet
smile
for
i
had
a
most
enjoyable
day
in
spite
of
the
injury
that
kept
me
a
prisoner
in
my
room
my
father
brought
me
a
beautiful
quite
as
large
as
some
live
ones
that
i
have
seen
and
a
quantity
of
pretty
things
to
be
used
in
its
adornment
my
little
friends
and
i
had
a
merry
happy
time
cutting
out
garments
and
making
them
up
the
next
christmas
and
new
year
day
were
spent
in
our
sweet
new
home
at
the
oaks
which
my
papa
had
bought
and
furnished
in
the
mean
time
my
christmas
gifts
were
beautiful
from
papa
books
and
a
pearl
necklace
and
bracelets
now
the
property
of
my
daughter
rosie
smiling
down
at
rosie
as
she
spoke
and
a
ring
to
match
from
him
who
was
afterward
my
beloved
husband
also
books
from
his
mother
and
my
aunt
adelaide
they
were
our
guests
at
dinner
that
day
between
breakfast
and
dinner
i
had
the
pleasure
of
distributing
gifts
among
the
house
servants
and
the
negroes
at
the
quarter
then
a
ride
with
papa
and
the
evening
till
my
early
bedtime
was
spent
sitting
on
his
knee
but
you
are
going
to
tell
us
about
that
new
year
too
mamma
you
asked
walter
as
she
paused
in
her
narrative
sitting
quietly
with
a
pensive
far
off
look
in
her
soft
brown
eyes
yes
she
said
rousing
from
her
reverie
i
remember
it
was
on
the
day
after
christmas
that
papa
asked
me
if
i
was
going
to
make
a
new
present
to
each
of
my
little
friends
of
course
i
was
delighted
with
the
idea
especially
as
he
allowed
me
great
latitude
in
regard
to
the
amount
to
be
spent
and
did
he
take
you
to
the
stores
and
let
yon
choose
the
presents
grandma
elsie
asked
lulu
that
would
be
half
the
fun
i
think
my
dear
indulgent
father
would
have
done
so
had
i
been
able
to
bear
the
fatigue
grandma
elsie
replied
but
at
that
time
i
was
quite
feeble
from
a
severe
illness
he
did
not
think
me
strong
enough
to
visit
the
stores
but
ordered
goods
sent
out
to
the
oaks
for
me
to
select
from
which
gave
me
nearly
as
much
enjoyment
us
i
could
have
found
in
going
to
the
city
in
search
of
them
did
you
find
gifts
to
suit
mamma
queried
walter
and
oh
wo
you
tell
us
how
many
and
what
they
were
beside
the
roselands
little
people
replied
his
mother
there
were
lucy
and
herbert
carrington
carrie
howard
isabel
carleton
mary
leslie
and
flora
arnott
to
be
remembered
for
the
last
named
who
was
also
the
youngest
i
selected
a
beautiful
wax
doll
and
a
complete
wardrobe
of
ready
made
clothes
for
it
all
neatly
packed
in
a
tiny
trunk
to
mary
leslie
i
gave
a
ring
and
to
each
of
the
other
girls
a
handsome
bracelet
to
herbert
who
was
a
great
reader
a
set
of
handsomely
bound
books
all
these
little
friends
of
mine
were
spending
the
christmas
holidays
at
pinegrove
the
home
of
the
howards
papa
and
i
had
been
invited
too
but
had
declined
because
of
my
feeble
state
when
my
gifts
were
ready
i
asked
him
if
they
should
be
sent
to
pinegrove
will
see
about
it
he
answered
have
plenty
of
time
there
are
two
days
yet
and
it
will
not
take
a
messenger
half
an
hour
to
travel
from
here
to
pinegrove
so
i
said
no
more
for
i
never
was
allowed
to
tease
but
when
new
year
morning
came
and
the
presents
had
not
been
sent
i
began
to
feel
decidedly
uneasy
and
papa
evidently
perceived
it
though
neither
of
us
said
a
word
on
the
subject
that
was
uppermost
in
my
mind
papa
had
some
beautiful
books
and
pictures
for
me
which
he
gave
me
before
breakfast
saying
he
hoped
they
would
help
me
pass
the
day
pleasantly
he
would
be
glad
to
make
it
the
happiest
new
year
i
had
known
yet
he
smiled
tenderly
upon
me
as
he
said
it
then
held
me
close
in
his
arms
and
kissed
me
over
and
over
again
and
i
returned
his
kisses
putting
my
arms
about
his
neck
and
hugging
him
as
tight
as
i
could
after
that
we
had
breakfast
and
family
worship
and
then
he
took
me
on
his
knee
again
and
asked
how
i
would
like
to
spend
the
day
i
answered
that
i
would
be
glad
to
have
a
drive
if
he
did
not
think
it
too
cold
he
said
he
thought
it
was
not
if
i
were
well
wrapped
up
there
was
no
snow
to
make
sleighing
so
the
carriage
was
ordered
i
was
bundled
up
in
furs
and
we
drove
several
miles
as
we
were
about
starting
i
ventured
to
ask
have
you
forgotten
to
send
my
presents
to
pinegrove
he
smiled
and
said
my
darling
in
a
very
pleasant
tone
but
that
was
all
and
when
we
came
back
i
noticed
that
the
presents
were
still
in
a
closet
in
my
dressing
room
where
they
had
lain
ever
since
they
were
bought
i
was
quite
puzzled
to
understand
it
but
i
asked
no
questions
mammy
arranged
my
hair
and
dress
and
i
went
back
to
the
parlor
where
papa
was
sitting
reading
he
laid
aside
his
book
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
room
took
me
on
his
knee
and
began
telling
me
funny
stories
that
kept
me
laughing
till
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
some
one
has
come
he
said
seems
we
are
not
to
spend
the
day
alone
after
all
then
in
another
minute
or
two
the
door
opened
and
in
came
my
six
little
friends
for
whom
i
had
bought
the
presents
grace
clapped
her
hands
in
delight
oh
how
nice
and
did
you
have
a
good
time
grandma
elsie
yes
very
they
had
all
come
to
spend
the
day
i
had
the
pleasure
of
presenting
my
gifts
in
person
and
of
seeing
that
they
were
fully
appreciated
we
played
quiet
games
and
papa
told
us
lovely
stories
there
was
no
fretting
or
quarrelling
everybody
was
in
high
good
humor
and
when
the
time
came
to
separate
my
guests
all
bade
good
bye
saying
had
never
had
a
more
enjoyable
day
now
please
tell
about
the
next
christmas
and
new
year
mamma
urged
walter
as
she
paused
as
though
feeling
that
her
tale
was
ended
let
mamma
have
time
to
breathe
and
to
think
what
comes
next
walter
said
rosie
do
you
see
that
what
she
is
doing
i
am
thinking
of
those
little
friends
of
mine
sighed
their
mother
asking
myself
are
they
now
ah
what
changes
life
brings
how
short
and
hasty
it
is
and
how
soon
it
will
be
over
i
mean
the
life
in
this
world
it
is
likened
in
the
bible
to
a
pilgrimage
a
tale
that
is
told
a
flower
that
soon
withers
or
is
cut
down
by
the
mower
scythe
a
dream
a
sleep
a
vapor
a
shadow
a
handbreadth
a
thread
cut
by
the
weaver
mamma
are
those
friends
of
yours
all
dead
asked
walter
i
will
tell
you
about
them
she
answered
herbert
carrington
died
young
he
was
barely
sixteen
with
the
words
a
look
of
pain
swept
across
the
still
fair
sweet
face
of
the
speaker
and
she
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
almost
overcome
by
some
sad
recollection
violet
who
had
heard
the
story
from
grandma
rose
understood
it
mamma
dear
she
said
softly
what
a
happy
thing
it
was
for
him
poor
sufferer
that
he
was
to
be
taken
so
early
to
the
father
house
on
high
where
pain
and
sin
and
sorrow
are
unknown
yes
returned
her
mother
furtively
wiping
away
a
tear
and
calling
to
mind
the
dreadful
scenes
of
the
war
that
followed
some
years
later
and
the
sore
trials
that
resulted
in
the
carrington
family
i
feel
that
he
was
taken
away
from
the
evil
to
come
of
the
others
forming
that
little
company
flora
arnott
too
died
young
mary
leslie
married
and
moved
away
and
i
have
lost
sight
of
her
for
many
years
carrie
howard
lived
to
become
a
wife
and
mother
but
was
called
away
from
earth
years
ago
the
same
words
would
tell
isabel
carleton
story
lucy
carrington
and
i
are
the
only
ones
left
and
she
like
myself
has
children
and
grandchildren
i
hear
from
her
now
and
then
and
we
meet
occasionally
when
i
go
north
or
she
pays
a
visit
to
the
old
home
at
ashlands
ross
said
rosie
half
in
assertion
half
inquiringly
yes
that
is
her
married
name
and
aunt
sophy
who
lives
at
ashlands
now

the
widow
of
lucy
older
brother

together
at
that
time
the
next
summer
we
went
north
and
while
there
visited
at
elmgrove
allison
country
seat
which
gave
papa
and
miss
rose
an
opportunity
to
become
quite
well
acquainted
i
had
known
and
loved
miss
rose
before
and
was
very
glad
when
papa
told
me
she
had
consented
to
become
his
wife
and
my
mother
they
were
married
in
the
fall
and
when
we
returned
to
the
oaks
she
was
with
us
that
made
my
next
christmas
and
new
year
still
happier
than
the
last
and
when
yet
another
came
round
my
treasures
had
been
increased
in
number
by
the
advent
of
a
darling
little
brother
uncle
horace

walter
mamma

very
glad
when
god
gave
him
to
you

was

answered
with
a
smile
i
had
never
had
a
brother
or
sister
and
had
often
been
hungry
for
one
and
he
has
always
been
a
dear
loving
brother
to
me
she
went
on
and
your
aunt
rose
who
came
to
us
while
we
were
in
europe
some
eight
years
later
as
sweet
a
sister
as
any
one
could
desire

those
holidays
mamma
the
first
when
you
had
a
brother

rosie
request
was
seconded
by
several
other
voices
in
the
little
crowd
and
grandma
elsie
ever
willing
to
give
pleasure
kindly
complied
but
as
my
young
readers
have
already
had
the
story
in
mildred
married
life
i
shall
not
repeat
it
here
suffice
it
to
say
it
seemed
to
greatly
interest
all
her
listeners
and
lulu
gathered
from
it
a
far
different
impression
of
dinsmore
as
a
father
from
that
she
had
derived
from
tales
told
her
by
some
of
the
old
servants
in
the
family
connection
they
had
given
her
the
idea
that
he
was
exceedingly
stern
and
tyrannical
but
his
daughter
painted
him
as
a
most
loving
and
indulgent
parent
mayhap
the
truth
lay
somewhere
between
the
two
pictures
for
as
he
himself
had
often
said
elsie
was
ever
wo
to
look
upon
him
through
rose
colored
glasses
you
did
have
a
very
nice
time
grandma
elsie
i
could
almost
wish
been
in
your
place
exclaimed
lulu
when
the
tale
had
come
to
an
end
but
no
i
do
either
for
then
i
could
be
my
father
child
putting
her
arm
round
the
captain
neck
and
laying
her
cheek
to
his
and
to
belong
to
him
is
better
than
anything
else
my
little
lulu
being
the
judge
laughed
the
captain
tightening
the
clasp
of
his
arm
about
her
waist
or
any
other
of
your
children
papa
added
grace
from
her
seat
on
his
knee
affectionately
stroking
his
face
with
her
small
white
hand
as
she
spoke
grandma
elsie
wo
you
please
go
on
and
tell
about
other
christmases
that
you
remember
i
think
my
dear
i
have
done
my
full
share
of
story
telling
for
one
evening
replied
travilla
pleasantly
it
is
your
father
turn
now
as
the
next
in
age
captain
will
you
not
favor
us
with
some
of
your
reminiscences
of
former
holiday
experiences
or
of
something
else
if
you
prefer
i
know
you
are
a
famous
story
teller
oh
yes
captain
oh
yes
papa
do
please
urged
the
others
some
other
time
perhaps
he
said
do
you
know
how
late
it
is
time
to
call
the
servants
in
to
prayers
and
then
for
the
little
folks
to
seek
their
nests
max
my
son
ring
the
bell
then
you
do
mean
to
let
us
stay
up
to
watch
the
old
year
out
and
the
new
year
in
papa
queried
the
lad
as
he
rose
and
obeyed
the
order
hardly
his
father
answered
with
a
slight
smile
you
are
all
too
young
to
be
allowed
to
lose
so
large
a
portion
of
your
night
rest
to
do
so
would
spoil
all
the
anticipated
pleasure
of
then
i
am
sure
we
do
want
to
captain
said
evelyn
for
we
are
looking
forward
to
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
chapter
xii
my
little
grace
looks
tired
the
captain
said
bending
down
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
as
the
little
folks
were
bidding
good
night
i
shall
carry
you
up
stairs
darling
after
the
old
custom
thank
you
papa
i
very
willing
replied
grace
clasping
his
neck
with
her
small
arms
lulu
shall
i
say
good
night
to
you
first
he
asked
smiling
down
at
his
eldest
daughter
standing
by
his
side
as
you
have
eva
with
you
you
will
perhaps
not
care
for
the
usual
bit
of
good
night
chat
with
your
father
yes
indeed
i
do
care
for
it
papa
cried
lulu
why
i
have
another
chance
this
year
i
would
miss
it
for
anything
then
you
shall
not
he
said
looking
both
pleased
and
amused
that
sounds
as
though
the
next
opportunity
were
far
in
the
distance
he
passed
out
of
the
room
as
he
spoke
and
on
up
the
wide
stairway
lulu
and
eva
following
each
with
an
arm
about
the
other
waist
those
talks
must
be
so
delightful
remarked
the
latter
in
a
low
tone
and
with
a
slight
sigh
i
very
glad
you
do
let
me
hinder
them
dear
lu
i
knew
you
would
want
me
to
said
lulu
you
are
always
so
kind
and
thoughtful
for
others
and
though
papa
sometimes
gives
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
when
we
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
i
think
he
wo
stay
more
than
a
minute
or
two
so
that
it
keep
me
long
away
from
you
oh
please
do
hurry
for
my
sake
said
eva
adding
softly
you
know
i
too
shall
be
glad
of
a
few
minutes
alone
with
my
best
friend
so
if
you
like
i
will
go
into
the
little
tower
room
while
your
papa
is
with
you
you
can
have
both
that
and
my
bedroom
to
yourself
dear
returned
lulu
for
i
shall
receive
papa
in
the
little
sitting
room
that
is
gracie
and
mine
they
had
reached
the
upper
hall
the
captain
passed
into
bedroom
lulu
into
her
own
eva
with
her
such
a
sweet
pretty
room
eva
said
glancing
around
it
i
am
always
struck
with
that
thought
on
coming
into
it
though
i
have
seen
it
so
often
yes
returned
lulu
her
face
lighting
up
with
pleasure
i
think
it
so
myself
our
dear
father
is
constantly
adding
pretty
things
here
and
there
to
our
room
and
doing
oh
so
much
to
make
his
children
happy
yet
would
you
believe
it
eva
i
am
sometimes
both
and
disobedient
to
him
not
now
not
lately
evelyn
said
half
in
assertion
half
inquiringly
and
with
a
look
of
surprise
yes
lulu
replied
in
a
low
remorseful
tone
her
eyes
downcast
her
face
flushing
painfully
only
last
month
one
day
max
was
teasing
me
and
i
was
in
very
bad
humor
so
answered
him
very
crossly
papa
happened
to
be
in
the
next
room
and
overheard
it
all
and
called
to
us
both
to
come
to
him
his
voice
sounded
stern
and
i
felt
angry
and
rebellious
max
never
does
feel
so
i
believe
anyway
he
always
obedient
and
he
went
at
once
but
i
waited
to
be
called
a
second
time
and
o
eva
dreadfully
dreadfully
ashamed
but
i
feel
as
if
i
must
tell
you
because
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
think
me
so
much
better
than
i
am
dear
lu
do
tell
it
if
it
hurts
you
so
i
sure
if
you
were
not
a
good
girl
you
would
feel
so
very
sorry
and
ashamed
evelyn
interrupted
putting
both
arms
round
her
friend
and
kissing
her
with
warmth
of
affection
no
indeed
i
not
said
lulu
and
i
tell
it
if
only
to
punish
myself
for
my
badness
papa
has
never
punished
me
for
it
though
i
really
did
wish
he
would
and
asked
him
to
over
and
over
again
that
seems
very
odd
eva
said
half
smiling
most
people
are
only
too
glad
to
escape
punishment
maybe
i
different
from
most
folks
said
lulu
but
i
always
want
to
beat
myself
when
i
been
so
hateful
and
so
if
papa
punishes
me
i
always
feel
a
good
deal
happier
after
it
over
but
i
must
finish
my
story
papa
asked
did
you
hear
me
bid
you
come
to
me
and
i
answered
sir
then
muttered
i
not
come
a
step
till
i
get
ready
evelyn
seemed
lost
in
astonishment
oh
lu
did
you
really
say
that
could
you
venture
to
speak
so
to
your
father
a
man
whom
everybody
respects
so
highly
and
who
is
so
dear
and
kind
to
you
i
did
acknowledged
lulu
her
head
hanging
still
lower
and
her
cheek
flushing
more
hotly
you
see
when
i
lived
with
aunt
beulah
i
got
into
the
way
of
being
very
saucy
to
her
and
i
suppose
that
how
i
came
to
speak
so
to
papa
oh
do
you
think
i
ought
to
be
dreadfully
ashamed
and
that
papa
should
have
punished
me
very
severely
i
suppose
he
is
the
best
judge
of
that
eva
answered
doubtfully
but
what
did
he
do
surely
he
did
pass
it
over
as
of
no
consequence
i
think
he
could
feel
it
right
to
allow
his
own
child
to
refuse
obedience
to
his
commands
no
of
course
not
the
minute
i
said
the
words
i
could
have
bitten
my
tongue
off
for
it
i
hoped
papa
had
heard
but
he
had
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
came
toward
me
very
quietly
not
at
all
as
if
he
was
in
a
passion
and
i
jumped
up
saying
will
papa
i
coming
then
he
said
in
a
tone
as
if
he
were
grieved
and
astonished
that
his
own
little
girl
could
talk
so
to
him
obedience
following
upon
a
most
insolent
refusal
to
obey
and
took
my
hand
and
led
me
to
the
side
of
his
chair
then
he
sat
down
and
talked
to
max
a
little
and
sent
him
up
to
his
room
and
after
max
had
gone
he
talked
to
me
he
said
he
must
punish
me
but
he
would
try
a
new
way
and
for
four
days
i
should
be
his
child
at
all
at
least
not
be
treated
like
it
but
just
as
if
i
were
only
a
little
girl
visitor
he
would
give
me
any
orders
or
advice
or
direction
or
instruction
and
i
must
take
any
liberty
with
him
that
i
would
feel
free
to
take
with
a
stranger
gentleman
he
said
i
must
understand
that
he
did
not
intend
to
subject
me
to
any
harsh
treatment
but
would
be
as
polite
and
attentive
to
my
wants
as
if
i
were
a
guest
in
the
house
o
lu
did
you
like
it
was
it
nice
no
indeed
i
thought
they
were
the
longest
days
i
ever
lived
and
wondered
how
i
could
ever
have
thought
i
like
to
be
my
own
mistress
instead
of
having
to
obey
papa
he
did
give
me
one
cross
word
or
even
look
but
he
did
invite
me
to
sit
on
his
knee
and
i
did
dare
do
so
he
did
call
me
pet
names
and
hug
me
up
in
his
arms
as
he
so
often
does
when
i
have
been
naughty
and
i
could
wait
on
him
as
i
always
love
to
do
he
let
me
do
the
least
thing
for
him
i
just
felt
as
if
i
was
one
of
the
family
at
all
and
would
ten
times
rather
have
had
the
hardest
of
whippings
at
least
so
far
as
the
pain
was
concerned
yes
of
course
it
would
have
been
half
so
hard
to
bear
at
least
i
can
imagine
that
to
be
made
to
feel
yourself
only
a
stranger
in
your
father
house
would
be
a
great
deal
worse
than
having
to
endure
quite
severe
bodily
pain
so
i
think
you
may
feel
that
you
have
been
punished
not
so
severely
as
i
deserve
returned
lulu
shaking
her
head
and
sighing
no
not
half
there
i
can
hear
gracie
calling
me
to
say
excuse
me
while
i
run
into
her
room
for
a
few
minutes
she
found
grace
alone
and
just
getting
into
bed
where
papa
lulu
asked
gone
down
stairs
but
he
said
he
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
to
have
his
bit
of
chat
with
you
in
our
then
i
just
kiss
you
good
night
and
hurry
back
to
get
ready
for
him
when
the
captain
came
he
found
lulu
ready
and
waiting
for
him
seated
by
the
fire
with
her
bible
open
in
her
hand
i
was
learning
my
verse
for
morning
papa
she
said
closing
the
book
and
laying
it
aside
as
she
rose
to
give
him
the
easy
chair
she
had
been
occupying
that
was
right
he
replied
sitting
down
and
drawing
her
to
his
knee
one
could
hardly
end
the
old
year
or
begin
the
new
in
a
better
way
than
by
the
study
of
god
word
well
has
my
little
daughter
anything
particular
to
say
to
her
father
only
that
i
wish
i
been
a
better
daughter
to
you
papa
and
that
i
hope
i
shall
be
this
no
next
year
the
year
that
to
begin
in
a
few
hours
i
do
hope
that
when
its
last
night
comes
you
can
say
daughter
lulu
has
been
once
disobedient
or
in
a
passion
for
a
whole
year
it
will
be
a
very
happy
thing
for
me
for
us
both
if
i
can
he
said
and
i
am
not
without
hope
that
it
may
be
so
but
my
dear
child
you
will
need
constant
watchfulness
lest
your
besetting
sins
overcome
you
when
you
least
expect
it
i
wish
i
could
ever
get
done
with
the
fight
she
sighed
it
such
a
hard
one
yes
i
know
dear
child
for
i
am
engaged
in
the
same
conflict
but
we
must
keep
on
resolutely
till
the
dear
master
calls
us
home
but
we
have
the
promise
of
his
help
all
the
way
and
that
we
shall
be
than
conquerors
through
him
that
loved
us
and
the
prize
is
eternal
life
at
god
right
hand
it
will
be
always
easy
to
be
good
when
we
get
to
heaven
yes
the
last
remains
of
the
old
evil
nature
will
have
been
taken
away
and
we
will
have
no
more
inclination
to
sin
i
am
very
glad
of
that
and
that
god
gave
me
such
a
good
christian
father
to
help
me
in
my
hard
fight
and
papa
i
must
tell
you
again
that
i
am
very
very
sorry
and
ashamed
because
of
my
naughtiness
last
month
dear
child
my
dear
humble
penitent
little
girl
he
said
tenderly
it
was
all
long
since
fully
and
freely
forgiven
now
good
night
my
darling
and
good
bye
till
next
year
he
added
in
playful
tone
kissing
her
fondly
over
and
over
again
unless
something
unforeseen
should
make
you
want
your
father
before
morning
in
that
case
you
will
not
have
far
to
run
to
find
him
oh
no
and
it
makes
me
glad
always
at
night
to
remember
that
you
are
so
near
and
the
doors
all
open
between
our
rooms
so
that
you
could
hear
me
if
i
should
call
out
to
you
papa
i
know
you
would
be
displeased
at
being
wakened
if
i
were
in
trouble
and
needed
you
no
indeed
daughter
in
that
case
i
should
be
only
too
glad
to
be
roused
that
i
might
hasten
to
your
assistance
but
let
your
greatest
rejoicing
be
in
the
thought
that
you
and
i
and
all
of
us
are
under
the
care
of
him
who
neither
slumbers
nor
sleeps
is
better
to
trust
in
the
lord
than
to
put
confidence
in
man
rosie
in
her
mamma
room
which
she
shared
at
this
time
as
on
a
former
occasion
was
preparing
for
bed
grandma
elsie
quietly
reading
in
an
easy
chair
beside
the
fire
presently
rosie
went
to
the
side
of
the
chair
and
dropping
on
her
knees
on
the
carpet
looked
up
smilingly
into
the
sweet
placid
face
bent
over
the
book
mamma
dear
i
have
come
for
my
good
night
kiss
before
getting
into
bed
she
said
softly
adding
sportively
the
last
i
shall
solicit
from
you
this
year
and
you
are
going
to
be
satisfied
with
one
her
mother
asked
letting
the
book
fall
into
her
lap
while
she
laid
one
hand
gently
on
her
young
daughter
head
and
gazed
tenderly
down
into
the
blooming
face
with
a
somewhat
sad
expression
too
rosie
thought
i
say
no
to
that
mamma
she
returned
laying
her
head
in
her
mother
lap
and
taking
into
her
own
the
hand
that
had
been
resting
on
it
to
press
it
again
and
again
to
her
lips
with
ardent
affection
for
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
less
than
half
a
dozen
elsie
gave
them
in
quick
succession
gathering
her
child
in
her
arms
and
making
her
rest
her
fair
head
on
the
maternal
bosom
and
rosie
felt
a
warm
tear
fall
on
her
cheek
mamma
she
exclaimed
in
concerned
surprise
you
are
crying
what
can
be
the
matter
have
i
said
or
done
anything
to
grieve
you
dear
heart
reaching
up
an
arm
to
clasp
her
mother
neck
while
she
scanned
the
loved
features
with
earnest
tender
scrutiny
for
a
minute
or
more
there
was
no
reply
then
elsie
said
in
moved
tones
softly
smoothing
the
hair
back
from
rosie
temples
as
she
spoke
and
gazing
tenderly
down
into
her
eyes
my
heart
is
sad
for
you
my
darling
because
while
another
year
is
rapidly
drawing
to
a
close
i
have
yet
no
reason
to
hope
that
you
have
sought
a
refuge
within
the
fold
of
the
good
shepherd
who
gives
to
his
sheep
eternal
life
the
dear
saviour
who
has
been
all
these
years
inviting
you
to
come
to
him
and
be
saved
mamma
i
am
very
young
yet
murmured
rosie
hanging
her
head
and
blushing
old
enough
to
have
become
a
disciple
of
jesus
years
ago
her
mother
said
in
sorrowful
tones
o
my
darling
give
him
the
best
years
of
your
life
the
whole
of
your
life
whether
it
be
long
or
short
is
he
not
worthy
of
it
yes
mamma
surely
there
can
be
only
one
answer
to
that
and
i
do
mean
to
to
try
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
with
the
coming
of
the
new
year
but
mamma
i
know
of
a
number
of
good
christians
who
did
begin
to
be
such
till
they
were
many
years
older
than
i
am
there
is
grandpa
for
one
yes
my
child
sighed
her
mother
but
he
has
always
deeply
regretted
having
so
long
delayed
beginning
the
christian
course
entering
the
service
of
the
dear
master
whom
now
he
loves
better
than
wife
or
child
or
any
created
being
there
are
many
reasons
my
darling
why
delay
is
both
dangerous
and
unwise
as
well
as
basely
ungrateful
you
allude
to
the
uncertainty
of
life
mamma
yes
and
of
the
continuance
of
health
and
reason
how
many
have
been
suddenly
overtaken
by
fatal
illness
that
at
once
robbed
them
of
the
power
to
think
so
that
if
preparation
for
the
solemn
realities
of
another
world
had
not
been
already
made
the
opportunity
for
so
doing
was
forever
lost
there
is
also
danger
that
god
spirit
may
cease
to
strive
with
you
and
without
his
help
you
can
not
come
to
christ
nor
do
we
know
how
soon
jesus
may
come
again
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
he
himself
has
told
us
that
he
will
come
as
a
thief
in
the
night
that
is
when
he
is
not
expected
but
rosie
my
dear
child
even
if
you
could
know
certainly
that
delay
will
not
cost
you
the
loss
of
your
soul
it
will
bring
you
other
loss
great
and
irreparable
what
mamma
rosie
asked
with
a
look
of
mingled
surprise
and
alarm
i
can
not
think
what
you
mean
while
it
is
a
precious
truth
that
all
who
finally
repent
and
accept
of
christ
as
their
only
saviour
will
inherit
eternal
life
a
life
of
holiness
and
unspeakable
happiness
at
god
right
hand
answered
her
mother
yet
there
will
be
a
difference
in
the
portions
of
those
who
have
spent
many
years
in
the
faithful
service
of
the
master
using
their
time
and
talents
for
the
advancement
of
his
cause
and
kingdom
and
striving
to
win
others
to
know
and
serve
him
and
themselves
to
grow
in
grace
and
conformity
to
his
likeness
and
his
will
and
that
of
others
who
have
been
saved
only
at
the
last
and
so
as
by
fire
all
will
be
perfectly
happy
but
some
will
have
a
greater
capacity
for
happiness
than
others
according
to
the
teachings
of
god
word
sin
is
the
greatest
folly
the
service
of
god
the
highest
wisdom
not
wisdom
cry
and
understanding
put
forth
her
voice
riches
and
honor
are
with
me
yea
durable
riches
and
righteousness
my
fruit
is
better
than
gold
yea
than
fine
gold
and
my
revenue
than
choice
silver
that
be
wise
shall
shine
as
the
brightness
of
the
firmament
and
they
that
turn
many
to
righteousness
as
the
stars
forever
and
ever
rosie
my
darling
it
is
the
dearest
wish
of
my
heart
to
see
you
engaged
in
that
work
but
you
can
not
teach
others
what
you
do
not
know
yourself
you
must
first
give
your
heart
to
god
and
learn
for
yourself
the
sweetness
of
his
love
will
you
not
do
it
now
at
once
oh
listen
to
his
gracious
invitation
me
thine
heart
for
some
moments
a
deep
and
solemn
hush
seemed
to
fill
the
room
rosie
still
kneeling
there
with
her
head
pillowed
on
her
mother
breast
elsie
heart
going
up
in
an
almost
agonizing
petition
for
her
child
at
length
rosie
lifted
her
head
looking
up
into
her
mother
face
with
dewy
eyes
and
a
very
sweet
smile
mamma
she
said
in
low
tremulous
tones
i
have
tried
to
do
it
i
have
asked
the
lord
to
forgive
all
my
sins
to
cleanse
me
from
mine
iniquities
and
to
take
me
for
his
very
own
and
i
think
he
has
heard
and
granted
my
petition
you
know
when
the
leper
came
to
him
saying
if
thou
wilt
thou
canst
make
me
clean
jesus
at
once
put
forth
his
hand
and
touched
him
saying
will
be
thou
clean
and
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
him
mamma
i
have
been
praying
the
leper
prayer
and
i
think
the
dear
lord
jesus
has
said
the
same
words
to
me
i
am
sure
of
it
elsie
said
with
emotion
for
he
is
the
unchangeable
god
christ
the
same
yesterday
and
and
forever
as
ready
to
be
moved
with
compassion
for
a
soul
as
he
was
for
the
leper
when
on
earth
and
he
has
said
that
cometh
to
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
out
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
upward
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
she
exclaimed
all
that
is
within
me
bless
his
holy
name

papa

to
make
a
great
deal
of
fun
for
us
all
happy

to
you

her

care
of
his
wife
or
be
more
loving
and
kind
to
her
than

is
to

then

up
i
think
you

as
well
go
back
to
bed
and
try
to
take
another
nap
he
answered
it
is
very
early
yet
lulu
hurried
into
the
where
polly
cage
was
hanging
and
struck
a
light
what
you
where
you
been
demanded
the
parrot
sleeping
in
my
bed
as
i
have
a
right
to
miss
saucebox
returned
lulu
laughing
as
she
opened
a
cupboard
door
and
brought
out
a
paper
of
crackers
there
take
that
and
see
if
you
can
hold
your
tongue
till
folks
are
ready
to
get
up
the
bird
took
the
offered
cracker
and
began
eating
it
standing
on
one
foot
on
its
perch
and
holding
the
food
in
the
claws
of
the
other
while
it
bit
off
a
little
at
a
time
lulu
looking
on
with
interest
you
have
to
behave
better
than
this
or
you
get
banished
to
the
attic
or
the
kitchen
or
some
other
place
she
said
shaking
her
finger
threateningly
at
poll
then
after
turning
down
the
light
she
ran
back
to
bed
are
you
asleep
eva
she
asked
in
a
whisper
no
dear
wide
awake
then
let
talk
for
i
as
wide
awake
as
i
can
be
but
did
your
father
say
you
were
to
try
for
another
nap
i
understood
him
to
mean
only
that
i
might
if
i
chose
not
that
i
must
but
perhaps
he
meant
that
he
wanted
me
to
so
i
keep
quiet
and
try
she
did
so
saying
to
herself
i
just
know
it
no
use
for
i
was
never
wider
awake
in
my
life
but
to
her
great
astonishment
the
next
thing
she
knew
it
was
broad
daylight
and
eva
up
and
brushing
out
her
hair
before
the
mirror
over
the
bureau
why
i
been
asleep
and
i
had
the
least
idea
of
such
a
thing
cried
lulu
springing
out
upon
the
floor
and
beginning
to
dress
in
all
haste
oh
you
had
a
nice
nap
and
will
feel
the
better
for
it
all
day
sure
returned
eva
laughing
in
a
kindly
way
and
that
is
your
reward
for
trying
to
do
as
your
papa
probably
wished
you
to
but
need
you
hurry
so
is
it
a
good
while
to
breakfast
time
yes
but
i
have
to
dress
and
say
my
prayers
and
i
always
like
so
much
to
have
a
little
time
to
chat
with
papa
before
the
bell
rings
lu
lu
screamed
the
parrot
time
for
breakfast
polly
wants
her
coffee
just
hear
polly
exclaimed
lulu
it
does
seem
as
if
she
must
have
sense
i
suppose
she
does
think
it
time
for
breakfast
does
she
drink
coffee
asked
eva
yes
she
is
very
fond
of
it
she
gets
a
cup
every
morning
she
a
very
amusing
pet
i
think
remarked
evelyn
what
fun
it
will
be
to
teach
her
to
say
all
sorts
of
cute
things
yes
sighed
lulu
but
papa
says
if
she
should
hear
angry
passionate
or
willful
words
from
my
lips
she
may
learn
and
repeat
them
to
my
shame
and
sorrow
but
oh
i
hope
i
never
shall
let
her
hear
such
i
do
believe
you
ever
will
say
such
words
any
more
dear
lu
eva
said
with
an
affectionate
look
into
her
friend
face
i
do
believe
you
have
ever
been
in
a
passion
since
since
the
time
that
little
elsie
had
that
sad
fall
no
i
have
not
been
in
a
rage
but
i
have
said
some
angry
words
a
few
times
and
oh
as
you
must
remember
that
i
told
you
some
very
rebellious
and
insolent
ones
to
my
dear
papa
not
so
long
ago
oh
dear
i
afraid
my
tongue
can
never
be
tamed
papa
made
me
learn
that
third
chapter
of
james
that
says
tongue
is
a
fire
a
world
of
iniquity
and
that
no
man
can
tame
it
then
he
talked
to
me
so
nicely
and
kindly
about
learning
to
rule
my
tongue
and
make
it
always
speak
as
it
ought
wise
kind
pleasant
words
and
he
told
me
the
only
way
to
do
it
was
by
getting
my
heart
right
by
god
help
because
as
the
bible
tells
us
in
another
place
it
is
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
that
the
mouth
speaketh
your
father
takes
a
great
deal
of
pains
to
teach
and
help
you
dear
lu
does
he
said
eva
yes
yes
indeed
returned
lulu
with
warmth
all
his
children
but
especially
me
i
think
because
i
the
naughtiest
and
have
the
hardest
work
trying
to
be
good
i
often
surprised
at
papa
patience
with
me
and
the
trouble
he
takes
to
help
me
in
my
hard
fight
with
my
passionate
wilful
temper
just
then
grace
voice
was
heard
at
the
door
happy
new
year
eva
and
lu
may
i
come
in
yes
come
happy
new
year
to
you
cried
both
girls
lulu
running
and
taking
her
sister
in
her
arms
to
hug
and
kiss
her
you
darling
child
you
look
bright
and
well
are
you
yes
you
old
woman
laughed
gracie
returning
the
hug
and
kisses
and
i
all
ready
for
breakfast
are
you
no
not
quite
i
am
said
eva
shall
we
go
into
the
gracie
and
wait
there
for
lu
yes
answered
grace
leading
the
way
and
i
be
learning
my
bible
verse
while
we
wait
for
her
and
papa
and
the
breakfast
bell
lulu
and
her
father
joined
them
at
the
same
moment
the
captain
kissed
the
little
girls
all
around
and
presented
each
with
a
pretty
little
portemonnaie
eva
thanked
him
with
smiles
blushes
and
appreciative
words
his
own
two
with
hugs
and
kisses
in
addition
to
the
thanks
given
in
words
mine
ever
so
pretty
papa
lulu
said
turning
it
about
in
her
hands
i
am
glad
you
are
pleased
with
it
he
said
smiling
but
are
you
going
to
be
satisfied
with
looking
at
the
outside
do
you
want
to
examine
the
lining
also
why
yes
sir
opening
it
oh
oh
it
is
empty
she
laughed
beginning
to
take
out
the
contents
two
clean
crisp
one
dollar
notes
and
a
handful
of
bright
new
quarters
dimes
and
five
cent
pieces
papa
how
kind
and
generous
you
are
to
me
grace
had
her
purse
open
by
this
time
and
found
it
lined
in
like
manner
with
lulu
dear
papa
thank
you
ever
so
much
she
said
looking
up
into
his
face
with
eyes
full
of
love
and
gratitude
it
a
great
deal
for
me
to
have
beside
all
the
rest
you
gave
me
you
are
both
as
welcome
as
possible
my
darlings
only
make
good
use
of
it
remembering
that
money
is
one
of
the
talents
for
which
we
must
give
account
to
god
at
last
he
answered
to
both
eva
my
dear
turning
to
her
you
will
find
the
same
in
yours
and
i
hope
will
accept
it
from
me
as
though
you
were
one
of
my
daughters
do
me
the
kindness
to
let
me
be
in
some
respects
a
father
to
you
since
your
own
is
absent
in
the
happy
home
to
which
i
trust
we
are
all
traveling
she
was
standing
near
the
present
he
had
given
her
in
her
hand
she
had
been
looking
from
it
to
lulu
and
grace
thinking
the
while
how
good
it
was
in
the
captain
to
treat
her
so
much
like
one
of
his
own
and
now
at
these
kind
words
spoken
in
tender
fatherly
tones
both
heart
and
eyes
grew
full
to
overflowing
he
saw
that
she
could
not
speak
for
emotion
and
taking
her
hand
drew
her
to
his
knee
and
kissed
her
saying
do
try
to
thank
me
in
words
my
dear
your
speaking
countenance
tells
me
all
you
would
say
what
you
screamed
polly
at
that
instant
just
as
if
she
were
calling
the
captain
to
account
for
his
actions
that
made
them
all
laugh
even
evelyn
who
had
been
just
ready
to
cry
then
the
breakfast
bell
rang
and
everybody
hastened
to
obey
its
summons
many
a
happy
new
year
was
exchanged
among
them
as
they
gathered
a
bright
faced
cheerful
set
in
the
pleasant
and
about
its
bountiful
table
each
had
a
gift
to
show
for
all
had
been
remembered
in
that
way
by
either
the
captain
or
violet
some
by
both
and
each
one
had
received
or
did
now
receive
something
from
grandma
elsie
a
book
toy
or
game
the
gifts
seemed
to
give
universal
satisfaction
and
all
were
in
gayest
spirits
shortly
after
breakfast
almost
before
the
children
had
done
with
comparing
and
talking
about
their
presents
the
other
guests
began
to
arrive
and
by
ten
everybody
who
had
been
invited
was
there
then
began
the
fun
of
arranging
themselves
in
groups
and
having
photographs
taken
after
that
the
acting
of
the
charades
the
picture
suggested
by
violet
was
taken
first
in
it
grandma
elsie
was
seated
between
her
father
on
one
side
and
her
namesake
daughter
on
the
other
leland
having
her
babe
in
her
arms
while
little
ned
leaned
confidingly
against
his
knee
the
captain
and
violet
with
their
two
little
ones
made
another
pretty
picture
then
the
captain
was
taken
again
with
his
older
three
grouped
about
him
then
grandma
elsie
again
with
her
son
edward
and
his
zoe
standing
behind
her
rosie
and
walter
one
on
each
side
she
thought
this
quite
enough
but
her
college
boys
insisted
on
having
her
taken
again
seated
between
them
it
was
then
proposed
that
the
other
members
of
the
company
should
be
taken
in
turn
singly
or
in
groups
but
all
declined
expressing
a
decided
preference
for
spending
the
time
in
a
more
amusing
manner
such
as
forming
tableaux
and
acting
charades
the
older
people
took
possession
of
a
large
parlor
and
sat
there
conversing
while
the
younger
ones
consulted
together
and
made
their
arrangements
in
the
library
misconstrue
was
the
first
word
chosen
presently
evelyn
walked
into
the
parlor
followed
almost
immediately
by
harold
with
a
book
in
his
hand
you
are
here
miss
he
said
glancing
at
evelyn
and
you
miss
as
sydney
dinsmore
came
tripping
in
from
the
hall
yes
and
here
comes
another
miss
she
replied
as
lulu
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
i
too

a
miss

four
of
us
here

said
rosie
coming
up
behind
lulu

maud
dinsmore
stepping
in
after
rosie
and
i

echoed
lora
howard
coming
after
her
well
stand
up
in
a
row
and
let
us
see
if
you
can
say
your
lesson
without
a
miss
said
harold
oh

grace
in
a
low
aside
to
her
little
friend
rosie
lacey
they
two
having
chosen
a
place
among
the
spectators
rather
than
with
the
actors
on
this
occasion
yes

rosie
i
wonder
why
they
do
have
some
of
the
boys
in
the
class
too
when
did
columbus
discover
america
miss
maud
asked
harold
in
returned
maud
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
quite
confident
of
the
correctness
of
her
reply
a
miss
for
you
said
harold
next
when
did
columbus
discover
america
in
just
after
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims

sydney

harold
shaking
his
head
what

a
book

she
held

hand
and
for
several
minutes
they
all
seemed

be
studying
diligently

young
actors
vanished
through

door
into
the
hall
they
were
hardly
gone
when
zoe
entered
carrying
a
small
basket
filled
with
flowers
which
she
began
to

about
laughing
all
the
time
fairly
shaking
with
laughter
laughing
laughing
till
the
tears
came
into

exciting
cause
of
so
much
mirth

said
dinsmore
at
length

herbert
elevating
his

in
astonishment

lulu
now
frank
began
to
play
the
part
of
a
clown
or
buffoon
acting
in
a
very
silly
and
stupid
manner
while
the
others
looked
on

in
derision

some
of
the

now
joined
the
spectators
while
harold
drew
out
a
little
stand
and
he
chester
and
herbert
seated
themselves
about
it
with
paper
and
pencils
before
them
assuming
a
very
air
frank
had
stepped
out
to
the
hall
in
a
minute
or
two

a

gracie
rosy

blushes
came
out
from
her
retreat
and
ran
to
hide
her
face
on
her
father
shoulder
while
he
held
her
close
with
one
arm
softly
smoothing
her
curls
with
the
other
hand

he
said
it

of
the
morning
after

harold
and
herbert
gave
an
exhibition
of
tricks
of
legerdemain
which
even
the
older
people
found
interesting
and
amusing
the
little
ones
were
particularly
delighted
with
a
marvellous
shower
of
candy
that
ended
the
performance
some
of
cousin
ronald
stories
of
the
heroes
of
scottish
history
and
song
made
the
evening
pass
delightfully
but
at
an
early
hour
the
whole
company
led
by
grandpa
dinsmore
united
in
a
short
service
of
prayer
praise
and
the
reading
of
the
scriptures
and
at
its
close
the
guests
bade
and
scattered
to
their
homes
well
said
max
following
the
rest
of
the
family
into
the
parlor
after
they
had
seen
the
last
guest
depart
i
never
had
a
pleasanter
new
year
day
nor
i
either
said
lulu
and
we
had
such
a
delightful
time
last
year
too
that
i
really
do
know
which
i
enjoyed
the
most
and
we
have
good
times
all
the
time
since
we
have
a
home
of
our
own
with
our
dear
father
in
it
remarked
grace
taking
his
hand
and
carrying
it
to
her
lips
while
her
sweet
azure
eyes
looked
up
lovingly
into
his
face
an
emphatic
endorsement
of
that
sentiment
from
both
max
and
lulu
then
the
captain
smiling
tenderly
upon
them
said
i
dearly
love
to
give
you
pleasure
my
darlings
my
heart
desire
is
for
my
happiness
in
this
world
and
the
next
but
life
can
not
be
all
play
so
lessons
must
be
taken
up
again
morning
and
i
hope
to
find
you
all
in
an
industrious
and
tractable
mood
i
should
hope
so
indeed
papa
returned
max
if
we
are
not
both
obedient
and
industrious
we
will
deserve
to
be
called
an
ungrateful
set
chapter
xiv
the
weather
the
next
day
was
so
mild
and
pleasant
that
max
and
lulu
asked
and
obtained
permission
to
take
a
ride
of
several
miles
on
their
ponies
they
went
alone
their
father
and
violet
having
driven
out
in
the
family
carriage
taking
the
three
younger
children
with
them
on
their
return
max
and
his
sister
approached
the
house
from
a
rear
entrance
to
the
grounds
passing
through
the
bit
of
woods
belonging
to
the
estate
the
garden
and
shrubbery
and
across
the
lawn
in
traversing
the
wood
they
came
upon
a
man
leaning
idly
against
a
tree
in
a
lounging
attitude
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
half
consumed
cigar
in
his
mouth
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
children
and
from
his
shabby
soiled
clothing
unkempt
locks
and
unshaven
face
it
was
evident
he
belonged
to
the
order
of
tramps
he
stood
directly
in
the
path
the
children
were
pursuing
just
where
it
made
a
sudden
turn
and
lulu
pony
had
almost
trodden
upon
his
foot
before
they
were
aware
of
his
vicinity
fairy
shied
snorting
with
fright
and
almost
unseated
her
young
rider
look
out
there
and
do
ride
a
fellow
down
growled
the
man
catching
hold
of
fairy
bridle
and
scowling
into
the
face
of
her
rider
lulu
did
not
seem
to
be
frightened
her
quick
temper
rose
at
the
insolence
and
she
exclaimed
authoritatively
let
go
of
my
bridle
this
instant
and
get
out
of
the
path
i
will
when
i
get
ready
and
no
sooner
returned
the
man
insolently
what
are
you
doing
in
these
grounds
sir
demanded
max
adding
you
have
no
call
to
be
here
let
go
of
that
bridle
and
step
out
of
the
path
at
once
i
not
under
your
orders
bubby
said
the
tramp
with
a
disagreeable
mocking
laugh
these
are
my
father
grounds
said
max
drawing
himself
up
with
a
determined
air
and
we
do
allow
tramps
and
loafers
here
so
if
you
do
let
go
of
that
bridle
and
be
off
i
set
my
dog
on
you
here
prince
prince
at
the
sound
of
the
call
answered
by
a
loud
bark
and
the
sight
of
prince
huge
form
making
rapid
bounds
in
his
direction
the
tramp
released
fairy
bridle
and
growling
out
an
oath
turned
and
made
his
way
with
all
celerity
toward
the
public
road
leaping
the
fence
that
separated
it
from
capt
raymond
grounds
barely
in
time
to
escape
prince
teeth
as
he
made
a
dash
to
seize
him
by
the
leg
oh
cried
lulu
drawing
a
long
breath
of
relief
what
a
happy
thing
that
prince
came
running
out
to
meet
us
yes
said
max
and
i
hope
he
has
given
that
fellow
a
fright
that
will
keep
him
from
ever
coming
into
these
grounds
again
if
he
is
a
scoundrel
his
looks
certainly
belie
him
very
much
they
had
held
their
ponies
in
check
while
watching
the
race
between
man
and
dog
but
now
urged
them
forward
in
haste
to
reach
the
house
for
the
short
winter
day
was
fast
closing
in
the
captain
was
standing
on
the
veranda
as
they
rode
up
you
are
a
trifle
late
children
he
said
as
he
stepped
to
the
side
of
fairy
and
lifted
lulu
from
the
saddle
but
his
tone
was
not
stern
yes
papa
said
max
i
afraid
we
went
a
little
farther
than
we
ought
at
any
rate
it
took
us
longer
than
we
expected
to
reach
home
again
and
we
were
detained
a
minute
or
two
just
now
out
here
in
the
grove
by
a
tramp
that
caught
hold
of
fairy
bridle
and
would
let
go
till
i
called
prince
and
he
showed
his
teeth
what
can
it
be
possible
cried
the
captain
closing
his
fingers
more
firmly
over
the
hand
lulu
had
slipped
into
his
and
gazing
down
into
her
face
with
a
look
of
mingled
concern
and
relief
it
is
well
indeed
that
lulu
was
not
alone
and
that
prince
was
at
hand
come
into
the
library
and
tell
me
all
about
it
he
led
lulu
in
as
he
spoke
max
following
while
a
servant
took
the
ponies
to
their
stable
capt
raymond
sat
down
and
drew
lulu
to
his
side
putting
an
arm
protectingly
around
her
while
max
standing
near
went
on
to
give
the
particulars
of
their
encounter
with
the
tramp
lulu
now
and
then
putting
in
a
word
now
daughter
the
captain
said
at
the
conclusion
of
the
story
i
hope
you
are
quite
convinced
of
the
wisdom
and
kindness
of
your
prohibition
of
solitary
rides
and
walks
for
you
yes
papa
i
am
and
do
not
intend
ever
to
disobey
you
again
by
taking
them
i
was
much
frightened
but
i
know
it
would
have
been
very
dangerous
for
me
if
i
been
alone
no
doubt
of
it
he
said
caressing
her
with
grave
tenderness
it
almost
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
what
might
have
happened
had
you
been
without
a
protector
and
i
doubt
if
i
could
have
protected
her
without
prince
help
papa
said
max
i
think
he
a
valuable
fellow
and
pays
for
his
keep
yes
i
am
very
glad
i
selected
him
as
a
christmas
gift
to
you
said
his
father
but
now
i
must
warn
you
both
to
say
nothing
to
or
before
gracie
about
this
occurrence
for
timid
as
she
is
it
would
be
apt
to
cause
her
much
suffering
from
apprehension
we
will
try
to
keep
it
a
secret
from
her
papa
replied
both
children
and
in
order
to
succeed
in
that
you
will
have
to
be
on
your
guard
and
give
no
hint
of
the
matter
in
presence
of
any
of
the
servants
we
will
try
to
remember
papa
they
promised
with
evident
intention
to
do
so
that
is
right
he
said
i
think
i
can
trust
you
not
to
forget
or
disobey
i
know
you
would
be
loath
to
have
your
little
sister
tortured
with
nervous
terrors
now
go
and
get
yourselves
ready
for
tea
lulu
was
full
of
excitement
over
her
adventure
and
through
the
evening
found
it
difficult
to
refrain
from
speaking
of
it
before
grace
but
equally
desirous
to
obey
her
father
and
to
save
her
little
sister
from
needless
suffering
she
resolutely
put
a
curb
upon
her
tongue
till
she
found
herself
alone
with
him
at
bedtime
then
she
must
needs
go
over
the
whole
scene
again
and
seeing
that
it
was
a
relief
to
her
excitement
he
let
her
run
on
about
it
to
her
heart
content
has
it
made
you
feel
at
all
timid
daughter
he
asked
kindly
no
papa
she
answered
promptly
i
do
think
the
man
could
get
into
the
house
do
you
i
think
it
most
probable
he
has
walked
on
till
he
is
miles
away
from
here
by
this
time
the
captain
answered
but
even
did
we
know
him
to
be
prowling
round
outside
we
might
rest
and
sleep
in
peace
and
security
assured
that
nothing
can
harm
us
without
the
will
of
our
heavenly
father
who
loves
us
more
than
any
earthly
parent
loves
his
child
he
drew
her
very
close
to
his
heart
and
imprinted
a
tender
kiss
upon
her
lips
as
he
spoke
yes
papa
it
makes
me
feel
very
safe
to
remember
that
thinking
how
dearly
you
love
me
so
that
i
know
you
would
never
let
anything
harm
me
if
you
could
help
it
she
returned
putting
an
arm
round
his
neck
and
hugging
him
tight
oh
i
am
so
glad
that
the
bible
tells
us
that
about
god
love
to
us
so
am
i
and
that
my
children
have
early
learned
to
love
and
trust
in
him
is
profitable
unto
all
things
having
promise
of
the
life
that
now
is
and
of
that
which
is
to
come
that
is
not
a
promise
that
god
faithful
followers
shall
be
rich
in
this
world
goods
but
faith
in
god
loving
care
makes
life
happy
even
in
the
midst
of
poverty
and
pain
riches
have
not
the
power
to
make
us
happy
but
the
love
of
god
has
and
those
who
begin
to
serve
god
in
the
morning
of
life
and
press
onward
and
upward
all
their
days
keeping
near
to
jesus
and
growing
more
and
more
like
him
will
be
happier
in
heaven
because
of
their
greater
capacity
for
the
enjoyment
of
god
and
holiness
than
the
saved
ones
who
sought
him
late
in
life
or
were
less
earnest
in
their
endeavors
to
live
in
constant
communion
with
him
and
to
bear
more
and
more
resemblance
to
him
the
bible
speaks
of
some
who
are
saved
and
of
others
to
whom
entrance
shall
be
ministered
abundantly
into
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
papa
said
lulu
earnestly
i
want
to
be
one
of
those
i
want
to
live
near
to
jesus
and
grow
every
day
more
like
him
oh
i
am
so
little
like
him
now
sometimes
i
fear
not
at
all
wo
you
help
me
all
you
can
i
will
my
darling
he
replied
speaking
with
emotion
every
day
i
ask
wisdom
from
on
high
for
that
very
work
the
work
of
helping
you
and
all
my
dear
children
to
be
earnest
faithful
servants
of
god
the
talk
with
her
father
had
done
much
to
quiet
lulu
excitement
and
she
fell
asleep
very
soon
after
laying
her
head
on
her
pillow
it
was
still
night
when
she
awoke
suddenly
with
the
feeling
that
something
unusual
was
going
on
in
the
house
she
sat
up
in
the
bed
and
listened
she
thought
she
heard
a
faint
sound
coming
from
the
room
below
and
slipping
from
the
bed
she
stole
softly
across
the
floor
to
the
chimney
where
there
was
a
hot
air
flue
beside
the
open
fireplace
dropping
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
she
put
her
ear
close
to
the
register
and
listened
again
almost
holding
her
breath
in
the
effort
to
hear
the
chimney
ran
up
between
her
bedroom
and
the
little
tower
room
opening
into
it
the
library
was
under
her
bedroom
and
opening
from
it
was
the
ground
floor
room
of
the
tower
which
was
very
strongly
built
had
only
the
one
door
and
very
narrow
slits
of
windows
set
high
up
in
the
thick
stone
walls
in
a
safe
in
that
small
room
were
kept
the
family
plate
jewelry
and
money
though
no
very
great
amount
of
the
last
named
as
the
captain
considered
it
far
wiser
to
deposit
it
in
the
nearest
bank
the
door
of
the
strong
room
as
it
was
called
was
of
thick
oak
plank
crossed
with
iron
bars
and
had
a
ponderous
bolt
and
stout
lock
whose
key
was
carried
up
stairs
every
night
by
the
captain
listening
with
bated
breath
lulu
ear
presently
caught
again
a
faint
sound
as
of
a
file
moving
cautiously
to
and
fro
on
metal
burglars
i
do
believe
it
burglars
trying
to
steal
the
money
and
silver
and
mamma
vi
jewelry
that
are
in
the
safe
she
said
to
herself
with
a
thrill
of
mingled
fear
and
excitement
with
that
she
crept
into
the
tower
room
softly
opened
the
register
there
and
applied
her
ear
to
it
the
sound
of
the
file
seemed
a
trifle
louder
and
presently
she
was
sure
she
heard
gruff
voices
though
she
could
not
distinguish
the
words
her
first
impulse
was
to
hurry
to
her
father
and
tell
him
of
her
discovery
the
second
thought
if
i
do
papa
will
go
down
there
and
maybe
they
kill
him
and
that
would
be
a
great
great
deal
worse
than
if
they
should
carry
off
everything
in
the
house
i
wish
i
could
catch
them
myself
and
lock
them
in
there
before
i
wake
papa
why
could
i
starting
to
her
feet
in
extreme
excitement
they
in
the
strong
room
the
bolt
on
the
library
side
of
the
door
and
probably
they
left
the
key
there
too
in
the
lock
if
i
going
to
try
to
do
it
the
sooner
the
better
i
ask
god
to
show
me
how
and
help
me
she
knelt
on
the
carpet
for
a
moment
sending
up
her
petition
in
a
few
earnest
words
then
rising
stood
for
an
instant
thinking
very
fast
she
could
gain
the
library
by
a
door
opening
into
a
back
hall
and
very
near
that
into
the
strong
room
whose
door
if
open
would
be
in
a
position
to
conceal
her
approach
from
the
burglars
till
she
could
step
behind
it
so
that
her
scheme
seemed
not
impracticable
she
hastily
put
on
a
dark
over
her
white
night
dress
and
thick
felt
slippers
on
her
feet
her
heart
beat
very
fast
as
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
there
might
be
an
accomplice
in
the
library
or
hall
or
that
the
door
from
the
one
into
the
other
might
creak
and
bring
the
miscreants
rushing
out
upon
her
before
she
could
accomplish
the
task
she
had
set
herself
well
what
if
they
should
lulu
raymond
she
asked
shutting
her
teeth
hard
together
be
half
so
bad
as
if
they
should
harm
your
father
you
could
be
very
well
spared
but
he
could
mamma
vi
max
and
gracie
would
break
their
hearts
if
anything
dreadful
happened
to
him
and
so
would
you
too
i
try
trusting
to
god
to
take
care
of
me
with
swift
noiseless
steps
she
passed
out
of
her
room
down
a
back
stairway
into
the
hall
just
spoken
of
and
gained
the
library
door
finding
it
to
her
great
joy
wide
enough
open
for
her
to
slip
in
without
touching
it
she
could
see
nothing
there
the
room
was
quite
dark
but
the
sounds
she
had
heard
were
still
going
in
the
strong
room
seeming
a
little
louder
now
the
men
must
be
in
there
at
work
on
the
safe
with
the
door
ajar
for
a
streak
of
light
at
the
back
between
it
and
the
jamb
told
her
it
was
not
quite
shut
she
crept
to
it
and
peeping
in
at
that
crack
saw
a
man
down
on
his
knees
working
at
the
lock
of
the
safe
while
another
stood
close
beside
him
holding
a
dark
lantern
open
so
that
the
rays
of
light
fell
full
and
strongly
upon
the
lock
his
confederate
was
trying
to
break
lulu
could
not
see
the
face
of
the
latter
his
back
being
toward
her
but
as
the
other
bent
forward
for
a
moment
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
work
the
light
fell
on
his
face
and
she
instantly
recognized
him
as
the
tramp
who
had
seized
fairy
bridle
in
the
wood
trembling
like
a
leaf
she
put
up
her
hand
and
cautiously
felt
for
the
bolt
holding
tight
to
it
and
exerting
all
her
strength
she
suddenly
slammed
the
door
to
and
shot
it
into
its
socket
she
heard
the
villains
drop
their
tools
spring
toward
and
try
the
door
with
muttered
oaths
and
curses
but
she
waited
to
feel
for
the
key
and
turn
it
in
the
lock
even
to
pull
it
out
and
thrust
it
into
the
pocket
of
her
gown
as
a
swift
thought
came
to
her
that
there
might
be
an
accomplice
lurking
about
who
would
release
them
if
she
left
it
there
then
she
ran
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
carry
her
through
the
library
and
hall
up
the
stairs
and
on
through
the
rooms
never
stopping
until
she
stood
panting
for
breath
beside
her
sleeping
father
she
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
but
laid
her
face
on
the
pillow
beside
his
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
the
touch
roused
him
and
he
asked
who
is
it
you
lulu
yes
papa
she
panted
i
i
locked
some
burglars
into
the
strong
room
and
have
locked
them
in
there
he
exclaimed
in
astonishment
starting
up
and
drawing
her
into
his
arms
surely
my
child
you
have
been
dreaming
no
papa
not
a
bit
i
locked
them
in
there
and
here
the
key
putting
it
into
his
hand
i
slammed
the
door
to
on
them
i
shot
the
bolt
too
and
i
do
think
they
can
get
out
but
what
will
we
do
papa
can
you
get
somebody
to
help
you
take
them
to
jail
yes
i
shall
telephone
at
once
to
the
sheriff
at
union
who
is
it
what
the
matter
asked
violet
waking
i
can
not
wait
at
this
moment
to
explain
matters
my
love
the
captain
said
hastily
picking
up
lulu
and
putting
her
in
the
place
in
the
bed
which
he
had
just
vacated
i
must
act
leaving
lulu
to
tell
you
her
story
with
the
last
word
he
hurried
from
the
room
and
the
next
moment
they
heard
the
telephone
bell
chapter
xv
what
is
it
lu
violet
asked
in
trepidation
oh
what
is
the
meaning
of
those
sounds
coming
from
below
are
burglars
trying
to
break
in
no
mamma
vi
returned
lulu
with
a
little
nervous
laugh
they
are
trying
to
break
out
break
out
what
can
you
mean
child
they
are
locked
into
the
strong
room
mamma
vi
and
papa
is
calling
for
help
to
take
them
to
jail
hark
do
you
hear
him
they
sat
up
in
the
bed
listening
intently
hello
the
captain
called
then
in
another
moment
capt
raymond
of
woodburn
wants
the
sheriff
they
heard
him
say
ah
are
you
there
wright
burglars
in
the
house
burglars
here
we
have
them
fast
locked
into
the
room
with
the
safe
they
were
trying
to
break
open
send
a
constable
and
several
men
to
help
him
as
promptly
as
you
can
the
reply
was
of
course
inaudible
to
the
listeners
in
the
bedroom
but
the
next
moment
the
captain
spoke
again
yes
i
can
hold
them
till
you
can
get
here
unless
some
outside
accomplice
should
come
to
their
aid
he
seemed
to
listen
to
a
response
then
a
tinkle
of
his
bell
told
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
he
turned
at
once
to
a
private
telephone
connecting
the
dwelling
house
with
the
outside
cabins
in
which
his
lodged
and
called
them
to
come
to
his
assistance
then
back
he
went
to
his
bedroom
to
reassure
violet
and
send
lulu
to
grace
who
had
waked
and
was
calling
in
affright
to
know
what
was
the
matter
do
not
be
alarmed
my
dear
he
said
as
he
hastily
threw
on
his
clothes
i
really
think
there
is
no
cause
for
apprehension
but
i
must
hurry
down
to
admit
the
servants
whether
the
burglars
have
left
a
door
open
or
not
i
do
not
know
see
in
what
condition
things
are
in
the
lower
rooms
and
keep
guard
over
my
prisoners
till
the
sheriff
or
constable
and
his
men
arrive
what
can
i
do
asked
violet
stay
here
out
of
harm
way
and
ready
to
soothe
and
quiet
the
children
should
they
wake
in
affright
he
answered
as
he
again
hastened
away
violet
sprang
from
the
bed
and
went
with
swift
noiseless
steps
into
the
nursery
all
was
quiet
there
children
and
nurse
soundly
sleeping
she
retraced
her
steps
and
went
on
into
grace
room
where
the
two
little
girls
were
lying
together
in
the
bed
locked
in
each
other
arms
grace
trembling
with
fear
lulu
bravely
struggling
with
her
own
excitement
and
trying
to
calm
and
soothe
her
little
sister
o
mamma
vi
i
so
glad
you
come
she
exclaimed
as
violet
drew
near
then
seated
herself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
bent
down
to
kiss
first
the
one
and
then
the
other
for
gracie
is
so
frightened
i
so
afraid
those
wicked
men
will
hurt
papa
sobbed
grace
god
will
take
care
of
him
dear
child
violet
said
repeating
her
caress
beside
your
papa
just
told
me
he
thought
there
was
no
cause
for
apprehension
but
lulu
i
have
not
heard
yet
how
the
burglars
came
to
be
locked
into
the
strong
room
tell
me
about
it
something
waked
me
mamma
vi
and
i
heard
them
and
by
listening
a
little
i
made
sure
where
they
were
at
first
i
thought
i
run
and
call
papa
but
then
i
thought
there
are
two
of
them
if
not
more
and
papa
is
only
one
so
he
would
hardly
have
a
chance
in
trying
to
fight
them
but
if
i
should
slip
quietly
down
and
slam
the
door
to
and
lock
them
in
it
would
save
risking
papa
life
and
if
they
should
catch
me
and
kill
me
it
would
be
half
so
bad
as
if
they
hurt
papa
so
i
asked
god
to
help
me
and
take
care
of
me
then
i
ran
down
the
back
stairs
to
the
library
the
door
into
the
back
hall
was
far
enough
open
to
let
me
slip
in
without
touching
it
so
that
i
did
so
without
making
any
noise
to
attract
their
attention
then
seeing
by
the
light
coming
from
the
crack
at
the
back
of
the
strong
room
door
that
they
were
in
there
i
crept
close
up
and
peeped
in
and
there
they
were
one
down
on
his
knees
working
at
the
lock
of
the
safe
the
other
holding
a
lantern
to
give
him
light
when
i
had
watched
them
for
a
minute
i
asked
god
again
to
help
me
then
i
felt
for
the
bolt
and
kept
my
hand
on
it
while
i
all
of
a
sudden
pushed
against
the
door
with
all
my
might
and
slammed
it
to
and
shot
the
bolt
in
i
hardly
done
it
when
i
heard
the
men
drop
their
tools
and
run
to
the
door
and
try
to
get
it
open
saying
dreadful
words
too
that
frightened
me
so
i
only
waited
to
lock
the
door
also
before
i
started
to
run
upstairs
and
on
through
the
rooms
till
i
got
to
papa
he
was
asleep
and
i
was
so
out
of
breath
and
my
heart
beating
so
fast
i
could
speak
for
a
minute
but
i
put
my
arm
round
his
neck
and
my
cheek
on
the
pillow
close
to
his
and
he
woke
and
it
was
you
who
locked
the
burglars
in
exclaimed
violet
in
astonishment
i
heard
before
now
of
women
doing
such
things
but
never
of
a
little
girl
like
you
attempting
it
you
dear
brave
unselfish
child
i
am
very
very
proud
of
you
and
she
bent
down
again
and
kissed
lulu
several
times
the
burglars
quite
aware
that
their
presence
in
the
house
was
known
were
making
desperate
efforts
to
escape
trying
to
force
the
lock
or
break
down
the
door
at
the
same
time
cursing
and
swearing
in
tones
of
concentrated
fury
the
captain
drew
near
and
spoke
to
them
men
he
said
sternly
you
are
caught
in
a
trap
you
have
laid
for
yourselves
and
escape
is
impossible
both
lock
and
door
are
strong
enough
to
resist
your
utmost
efforts
therefore
you
may
as
well
take
matters
quietly
that
we
wo
let
us
out
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
growled
one
of
the
villians
grinding
his
teeth
with
rage
have
a
little
patience
returned
the
captain
you
shall
be
taken
out
presently
and
off
the
premises
you
are
by
no
means
desirable
inmates
in
the
home
of
any
honest
citizen
the
response
to
that
was
a
threat
of
vengeance
to
be
taken
sooner
or
later
should
he
dare
to
deliver
them
up
to
justice
finding
their
threats
disregarded
they
tried
persuasion
appeals
to
his
compassion
asserting
that
it
was
their
first
attempt
to
rob
and
that
they
were
driven
to
it
by
necessity
they
and
their
families
being
in
sore
straits
from
extreme
poverty
and
promises
to
lead
honest
lives
in
future
one
voice
the
captain
recognized
as
that
of
the
groom
he
had
dismissed
some
months
before
because
of
his
cruelty
to
thunderer
ajax
he
said
sternly
you
are
lying
to
me
i
know
that
your
family
are
not
in
distress
and
that
you
can
make
an
honest
living
if
you
choose
to
be
industrious
and
faithful
to
your
employers
you
were
well
paid
here
but
lost
your
situation
by
inexcusable
cruelty
to
dumb
animals
since
discharging
you
i
have
more
than
once
supplied
the
wants
of
your
wife
and
children
and
this
is
your
grateful
return
coming
to
rob
me
bringing
with
you
another
and
perhaps
more
desperate
villain
than
yourself
the
had
followed
their
master
into
the
library
and
stood
listening
to
the
colloquy
in
astonishment
how
dey
git
locked
up
in
dar
asked
one
miss
lulu
slammed
the
door
to
on
them
and
locked
and
bolted
it
he
replied
his
eyes
shining
at
thought
of
the
unselfish
bravery
of
his
child
ki

an
dey
two
big
men
she
undoubtedly
did
it
returned
the
captain
smiling
at
the
evident
amazement
she
heard
them
at
work
with
their
tools
on
the
safe
door
came
softly
down
into
this
room
peeped
at
them
through
the
crack
behind
the
door
there
and
before
they
were
aware
of
her
vicinity
slammed
it
to
and
bolted
and
locked
it
on
them
hurrah
for
little
miss

cried
the
men
one
of
them
adding

wah

gineral

leas
said
another
seeing
no
hope
of
escape
the
prisoners
had
ceased
their
efforts
and
awaited
their
fate
in
sullen
silence
they
did
not
know
who
had
been
their
captor
and
in
telling
the
story
of
lulu
exploit
the
captain
purposely
so
lowered
his
tones
that
scarce
a
word
reached
their
ears
at
this
moment
max
appeared
at
the
door
opening
from
the
library
into
the
front
hall
only
half
dressed
and
asking
in
much
excitement
what
was
the
matter
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
lights
and
the
noises
that
had
waked
him
his
father
explained
in
a
few
words
and
as
he
finished
a
loud
knocking
at
the
front
entrance
told
of
the
arrival
of
the
sheriff
and
his
posse
they
were
promptly
admitted
filed
into
the
library
and
formed
a
about
the
door
of
the
strong
room
each
man
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
cocked
and
ready
for
instant
use
the
door
was
then
unfastened
and
the
burglars
stepped
out
only
to
be
immediately
handcuffed
and
carried
away
to
prison
sullenly
submitting
to
their
arrest
because
they
saw
that
resistance
was
useless
but
before
being
taken
from
the
house
they
were
searched
and
the
captain
watch
found
upon
ajax
he
had
evidently
visited
the
of
his
late
master
to
obtain
the
key
to
the
strong
room
door
and
appropriated
the
watch
at
the
same
time
the
lock
of
the
safe
was
also
examined
and
found
but
little
injured
the
scoundrels
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
at
the
valuables
there
they
had
collected
together
some
from
other
parts
of
the
house
and
made
them
into
bundles
ready
to
carry
away
but
they
were
uninjured
and
had
only
to
be
restored
to
their
places
max
was
greatly
excited
papa
he
said
when
the
sheriff
had
departed
with
his
prisoners
and
doors
and
windows
were
again
secured
we
have
had
a
narrow
escape
from
serious
loss
perhaps
worse
than
that
for
who
knows
but
those
fellows
meant
to
murder
us
in
our
beds
i
think
not
my
son
replied
the
captain
i
presume
their
only
object
was
plunder
and
that
if
they
had
succeeded
in
rifling
the
safe
without
discovery
they
would
have
gone
quietly
away
with
their
booty
had
they
desired
to
kill
any
of
us
they
would
have
been
likely
to
attempt
it
when
upstairs
in
search
of
the
key
to
the
strong
room
and
it
was
lu
who
spoiled
their
plans
just
think
of
it
i
like
to
have
had
her
chance
papa
i
think
lu
splendid
she
has
certainly
shown
herself
very
brave
and
unselfish
on
this
and
several
other
occasions
the
captain
said
with
a
happy
look
in
his
eyes
but
come
we
will
do
well
now
to
go
back
to
our
beds
for
it
is
scarcely
four
he
added
consulting
his
recovered
watch
the
men
servants
had
returned
to
their
quarters
and
father
and
son
were
alone
violet
in
and
slippers
met
them
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
you
have
not
been
able
to
sleep
my
love
the
captain
said
with
a
glance
of
concern
at
her
pale
excited
face
but
of
course
that
was
not
to
be
expected
no
we
have
all
been
too
much
excited
to
close
an
eye
she
answered
they
are
gone
do
tell
me
all
about
it
o
papa
please
come
in
here
and
tell
it
where
gracie
and
i
can
hear
called
lulu
entreatingly
from
the
inner
room
and
the
bed
where
they
still
lay
clasped
in
each
other
arms
i
will
i
think
you
deserve
the
indulgence
he
said
going
to
them
violet
and
max
following
the
latter
asking
may
i
come
in
too
papa
yes
replied
his
father
placing
a
chair
for
violet
i
presume
it
will
be
a
relief
to
you
all
to
talk
the
matter
over
together
with
your
mamma
and
me
and
you
will
perhaps
be
more
inclined
for
sleep
afterward
papa
wo
you
sit
down
and
take
me
on
your
knee
and
hug
me
up
close
while
you
tell
it
entreated
grace
i
will
he
said
doing
as
she
requested
then
catching
a
longing
look
in
lulu
eyes
you
may
come
too
daughter
he
said
slip
on
your
and
stand
here
by
my
side
i
have
an
arm
for
you
as
well
as
one
for
gracie
lulu
promptly
and
joyfully
availed
herself
of
the
permission
lu
said
max
you
a
real
heroine
brave
as
a
lion
i
proud
to
own
you
for
my
sister
i
afraid
i
might
have
been
half
so
brave
oh
yes
max
i
sure
you
would
have
done
just
the
same
she
returned
blushing
with
pleasure
and
you
see
i
preferred
to
do
it
because
i
thought
they
might
kill
papa
and
that
would
have
been
oh
so
much
worse
than
being
killed
myself
clinging
lovingly
to
her
father
and
hiding
her
face
on
his
shoulder
as
she
spoke
dear
child
he
said
in
moved
tones
and
clasping
her
close
you
have
a
very
strong
and
unselfish
love
for
me
papa
it
would
have
broken
my
heart
and
mamma
vi
and
max
and
gracie
too
if
anything
dreadful
had
happened
to
you
and
what
about
papa
heart
if
he
should
lose
his
dear
little
daughter
lulu
or
anything
dreadful
should
happen
to
her
i
did
have
time
to
think
about
that
papa
i
know
you
love
me
very
much
and
would
be
sorry
to
lose
me
naughty
as
i
often
am
but
you
have
other
children
and
i
have
only
one
father
so
of
course
it
would
be
a
great
deal
worse
for
me
to
lose
you
and
all
the
rest
to
lose
you
too
the
worst
thing
that
could
befall
us
said
violet
but
lulu
dear
we
all
love
you
and
would
feel
it
a
terrible
thing
to
have
you
killed
or
badly
injured
in
any
way
indeed
we
would
exclaimed
max
with
a
slight
tremble
in
his
voice
oh
i
could
ever
ever
bear
it
sobbed
gracie
throwing
an
arm
round
her
sister
neck
well
said
the
captain
cheerfully
hugging
both
at
once
we
have
escaped
all
the
evils
we
have
been
talking
of
our
heavenly
father
has
taken
care
of
us
and
has
not
suffered
us
to
even
lose
our
worldly
goods
much
less
our
lives
and
we
may
well
trust
him
for
the
future
and
not
fear
what
man
can
do
unto
us
yes
said
violet
we
know
that
he
has
all
power
in
heaven
and
earth
and
will
never
suffer
any
real
evil
to
befall
one
of
his
people
will
not
suffer
thy
foot
to
be
moved
he
that
keepth
thee
will
not
slumber
levis
did
you
know
those
men
one
of
them
is
ajax
is
it
possible
she
exclaimed
what
a
return
for
all
the
kindness
you
have
shown
to
him
and
his
ajax
there
i
was
sure
i
heard
ajax
voice
in
the
hall
while
the
sheriff
was
here
cried
lulu
he
must
have
been
the
one
who
was
down
on
his
knees
trying
to
break
the
safe
lock
when
i
peeped
in
at
the
crack
i
did
see
his
face
but
the
other
was
a
white
man
yes
said
max
a
man
we
seen
before
the
tramp
you
saw
when
out
riding
asked
his
father
yes
sir
i
recognized
him
too
said
lulu
papa
what
will
be
done
with
him
and
ajax
they
will
have
to
be
tried
for
burglary
and
if
convicted
will
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
a
term
of
years
papa
will
we
have
to
appear
as
witnesses
on
the
trial
asked
max
yes
the
men
did
not
attempt
any
resistance
to
the
arrest
violet
said
inquiringly
no
they
saw
it
would
be
quite
useless
after
a
little
more
talk
the
captain
said
now
i
think
it
will
be
best
for
us
all
to
go
to
our
beds
again
and
try
to
sleep
till
the
usual
hour
for
rising
papa
i
feel
so
afraid
said
grace
holding
tight
to
him
as
he
would
have
laid
her
in
the
bed
my
darling
try
not
to
feel
so
he
said
caressing
her
try
to
believe
that
god
will
take
care
of
you
please
ask
him
again
papa
she
pleaded
then
they
all
knelt
while
the
captain
asked
in
a
few
simple
earnest
words
that
he
who
neither
slumbers
nor
sleeps
would
be
their
shield
defending
them
from
all
evil
and
that
trusting
in
his
protecting
care
they
might
be
able
to
banish
every
fear
and
lay
them
down
in
peace
and
sleep
i
am
not
afraid
now
papa
grace
said
as
they
rose
from
their
knees
you
may
please
put
me
in
my
bed
and
i
think
i
go
to
sleep
directly
for
i
very
tired
you
will
allow
them
to
sleep
past
the
usual
hour
my
dear
will
you
not
asked
violet
yes
he
said
i
wish
you
children
to
sleep
on
as
long
as
you
can
and
if
possible
make
up
all
you
have
lost
by
the
visit
of
the
burglars
it
will
not
matter
if
you
take
your
breakfast
later
than
usual
by
even
so
much
as
an
hour
or
two
but
that
will
make
us
late
for
lessons
papa
suggested
max
which
i
will
excuse
for
once
returned
his
father
with
an
indulgent
smile
chapter
xvi
day
had
fully
dawned
before
the
woodburn
household
was
astir
and
it
was
long
past
his
accustomed
hour
when
the
captain
paid
his
usual
morning
visit
to
his
little
daughters
he
found
them
up
and
dressed
and
ready
with
a
glad
greeting
were
you
able
to
sleep
my
darlings
he
asked
caressing
them
in
turn
oh
yes
indeed
papa
we
slept
nicely
they
answered
and
feel
refreshed
and
well
this
morning
yes
papa
thank
you
very
much
for
letting
us
sleep
so
long
i
allowed
myself
the
same
privilege
he
said
pleasantly
we
will
have
no
school
i
have
already
been
notified
that
there
will
be
a
preliminary
examination
of
the
prisoners
before
the
magistrate
this
morning
and
that
you
lulu
and
max
and
i
must
attend
as
witnesses
i
rather
not
go
papa
please
do
make
me
pleaded
lulu
my
child
it
is
not
i
but
the
law
that
insists
he
said
but
you
need
not
feel
disturbed
over
the
matter
you
have
only
to
tell
a
straightforward
story
of
what
you
heard
and
saw
and
did
in
connection
with
the
attempted
robbery
i
am
very
glad
very
thankful
he
went
on
that
i
have
always
found
my
little
daughter
perfectly
truthful
max
too
papa
yes
max
too
and
when
you
give
your
testimony
i
want
you
to
remember
that
god
the
god
of
truth
who
abhors
deceit
and
the
deceitful
and
who
knows
all
things
hears
every
word
you
say
taking
up
her
bible
and
opening
it
at
the
psalm
he
read
he
that
hath
clean
hands
and
a
pure
heart
who
hath
not
lifted
up
his
soul
unto
vanity
nor
sworn
deceitfully
he
shall
receive
the
blessing
from
the
lord
and
righteousness
from
the
god
of
his
salvation
then
turning
to
the
chapter
of
revelation
all
liars
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
closing
the
book
and
laying
it
aside
my
dear
children
he
said
earnestly
and
with
grave
tenderness
you
see
how
god
hates
lying
and
deceit
how
sorely
he
will
punish
them
if
not
repented
of
and
forsaken
speak
the
truth
always
though
at
the
risk
of
torture
and
death
never
tell
a
lie
though
it
should
be
no
more
than
to
assert
that
two
and
two
do
not
make
four
be
courteous
to
all
so
far
as
you
can
without
deceit
but
never
allow
your
desire
to
be
polite
to
betray
you
into
words
or
acts
that
are
not
strictly
truthful
the
children
were
evidently
giving
very
earnest
heed
to
their
words
papa
said
grace
sighing
and
hiding
her
blushing
face
on
his
shoulder
you
know
i
did
once
say
what
was
not
true
but
i
very
very
sorry
i
asked
god
many
times
to
forgive
me
for
jesus
sake
and
i
believe
he
has
no
doubt
of
it
my
darling
returned
her
father
for
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
i
do
believe
lu
ever
did
said
grace
she
a
great
deal
better
girl
than
i
am
no
it
is
not
that
i
am
better
than
you
was
lulu
emphatic
dissent
from
that
it
only
that
i
am
not
timid
like
you
if
i
had
been
very
likely
i
have
told
many
an
untruth
to
hide
my
faults
and
keep
from
being
punished
the
telephone
bell
is
ringing
papa
announced
max
looking
in
at
the
door
the
call
was
from
ion
a
vague
report
of
last
night
doings
at
woodburn
having
just
reached
the
family
there
they
were
anxious
to
learn
the
exact
truth
the
captain
gave
the
facts
briefly
and
suggested
that
some
of
the
ion
friends
drive
over
and
hear
them
in
detail
it
was
replied
that
several
of
them
would
do
so
shortly
grandma
elsie
among
them
and
that
she
would
spend
the
day
keeping
violet
company
during
her
husband
absence
at
union
if
as
she
supposed
preference
should
be
for
remaining
at
home
of
course
it
will
said
violet
who
was
standing
near
please
tell
mamma
i
be
delighted
to
have
her
company
the
captain
delivered
the
message
then
all
hurried
down
to
breakfast
everything
is
in
usual
order
i
see
violet
remarked
glancing
about
the
hall
and
in
at
the
library
door
as
they
passed
it
really
the
events
of
last
night
seem
more
like
an
unpleasant
dream
than
actual
occurrences
christine
has
been
up
for
several
hours
and
busied
in
having
everything
set
to
rights
the
captain
said
in
reply
as
usual
family
worship
followed
directly
upon
breakfast
and
it
was
scarcely
over
when
the
ion
carriage
drove
up
with
grandma
elsie
harold
and
herbert
accompanying
it
on
horseback
captain
i
am
greatly
interested
in
this
affair
said
harold
shaking
hands
with
his
indeed
we
all
are
for
that
matter
and
herbert
and
i
propose
going
over
to
union
to
be
present
at
the
examination
of
the
prisoners
is
your
strong
room
on
exhibition
i
own
to
a
feeling
of
curiosity
in
regard
to
it
you
are
privileged
to
examine
it
at
any
time
returned
capt
raymond
with
a
laugh
i
will
take
you
there
at
once
if
you
wish
for
we
will
have
to
be
setting
off
on
our
ride
presently
mother
would
you
like
to
see
it
also
yes
and
to
hear
the
story
of
the
capture
while
looking
upon
its
scene
the
captain
led
the
way
all
the
rest
following
except
lulu
who
stole
quietly
away
to
her
room
to
get
herself
ready
for
the
trip
to
town
she
shrank
a
little
from
the
thought
of
facing
the
two
desperados
and
testifying
against
them
but
kept
up
her
courage
by
thinking
that
both
her
heavenly
father
and
her
earthly
one
would
be
with
her
to
protect
and
help
her
also
by
the
remembrance
of
her
papa
assurance
that
she
need
not
feel
disturbed
that
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
tell
a
plain
straightforward
story
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
i
can
do
that
she
said
to
herself
it
will
be
quite
easy
for
i
remember
perfectly
all
about
it
those
wicked
men
threatened
papa
that
if
he
had
them
sent
to
jail
they
kill
him
some
day
when
they
are
let
out
again
and
i
suppose
they
want
to
kill
me
too
for
telling
about
it
in
court
but
i
know
they
ca
do
us
any
harm
while
god
takes
care
of
us
that
must
be
the
meaning
of
that
verse
in
proverbs
i
learned
the
other
day
is
no
wisdom
nor
understanding
nor
counsel
against
the
lord
and
the
next
verse
says
is
of
the
lord
so
i
sure
we
need
be
afraid
of
them
capt
raymond
opened
the
door
of
the
strong
room
and
called
attention
to
the
marks
of
the
burglars
tools
on
the
lock
of
the
safe
it
was
lulu
who
first
became
aware
of
their
presence
in
the
house
he
said
and
she
why
where
is
the
child
as
he
turned
to
look
for
her
and
perceived
that
she
had
disappeared
i
think
she
has
gone
upstairs
to
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
violet
said
ah
yes
i
suppose
so
leaving
me
to
tell
the
story
of
her
bravery
and
presence
of
mind
myself
he
proceeded
to
do
so
and
was
well
satisfied
with
the
encomiums
upon
his
child
which
it
called
forth
from
grandma
elsie
and
her
sons
i
congratulate
you
captain
upon
being
the
father
of
a
little
girl
who
can
show
such
unselfish
courage
grandma
elsie
said
with
enthusiasm
her
eyes
shining
with
pleasure
i
am
proud
of
her
myself
the
dear
brave
child
and
so
am
i
said
violet
but
of
course
with
a
mischievous
laughing
glance
into
her
husband
face
her
father
is
not
but
considers
her
a
very
ordinary
specimen
of
childhood
is
not
that
so
my
dear
ah
my
love
do
question
me
too
closely
he
returned
with
a
smile
in
his
eyes
that
said
more
plainly
than
words
that
he
was
a
proud
fond
father
to
the
child
whose
conduct
was
under
discussion
but
at
that
moment
the
carriage
was
announced
lulu
came
running
down
ready
for
her
trip
her
father
handed
her
in
then
seated
himself
and
put
his
arm
round
her
looking
down
into
her
face
with
a
tenderly
affectionate
smile
you
will
not
find
it
a
very
severe
ordeal
daughter
he
said
you
not
afraid
lu
are
you
asked
max
no
not
with
papa
close
by
to
take
care
of
me
and
tell
me
what
to
do
she
answered
nestling
closer
to
her
father
no
said
max
and
the
burglars
would
be
allowed
to
hurt
you
anyhow
the
magistrate
and
the
sheriff
and
the
rest
would
take
care
of
that
you
know
i
suppose
so
returned
lulu
but
for
all
that
it
would
be
dreadful
to
have
to
go
there
without
papa
you
would
want
to
yourself
max
i
a
great
deal
rather
have
papa
along
of
course
anybody
would
want
his
intimate
friend
with
him
on
such
an
occasion
and
papa
is
my
most
intimate
friend
replied
the
lad
with
a
laughing
but
most
affectionate
look
into
his
father
face
that
right
my
boy
i
trust
you
will
always
let
me
be
that
to
you
the
captain
said
grasping
his
son
hand
and
holding
it
for
a
moment
in
a
warm
affectionate
clasp
you
are
mine
too
papa
my
best
and
dearest
earthly
friend
lulu
said
lifting
to
his
eyes
shining
with
filial
love
papa
are
you
afraid
those
bad
men
will
try
to
harm
you
some
day
if
they
ever
get
out
of
prison
we
are
always
safe
in
the
path
of
duty
he
replied
and
it
is
a
duty
we
owe
the
community
to
bring
such
lawless
men
to
justice
for
the
protection
of
those
they
would
prey
upon
no
i
do
not
fear
them
because
i
am
under
the
protection
of
him
whose
hand
is
the
soul
of
every
living
thing
and
the
breath
of
all
mankind
lord
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
whom
shall
i
fear
the
lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
of
whom
shall
i
be
afraid
no
daughter
one
who
fears
god
need
fear
nothing
else
neither
men
nor
devils
for
our
god
is
stronger
than
satan
and
all
his
hosts
and
wicked
men
are
satan
servants
are
they
papa
yes
for
they
do
his
will
obey
his
behests
it
seems
to
me
christians
ought
to
be
very
happy
always
remarked
max
yes
they
ought
said
his
father
the
command
is
in
the
lord
always
and
it
is
only
lack
of
faith
that
prevents
any
of
us
from
doing
so
arrived
at
their
destination
they
found
a
little
crowd
of
idlers
gathered
about
the
door
of
the
magistrate
office
whither
the
two
prisoners
had
been
taken
a
few
moments
before
as
the
woodburn
carriage
drove
up
and
the
captain
and
his
children
alighted
from
it
the
crowd
parted
to
let
them
pass
in
several
of
the
men
lifting
their
hats
with
a
respectful
good
morning
sir
to
the
captain
good
morning
master
max
their
salutations
were
politely
returned
and
the
captain
stepped
into
the
office
holding
lulu
by
the
hand
and
closely
followed
by
max
harold
and
herbert
had
arrived
a
little
in
advance
and
were
among
the
spectators
who
with
the
officers
and
their
prisoners
nearly
filled
the
small
room
the
children
behaved
very
well
indeed
showing
by
their
manner
when
taking
the
oath
to
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
that
they
were
duly
impressed
with
the
solemnity
of
the
act
and
the
responsibility
they
were
assuming
lulu
was
of
course
the
principal
witness
and
her
modest
self
possessed
bearing
equally
free
from
boldness
and
forwardness
on
the
one
hand
and
bashfulness
and
timidity
on
the
other
pleased
her
father
extremely
and
won
the
admiration
of
all
present
as
did
also
her
simple
straightforward
way
of
telling
her
story
the
evidence
was
so
full
and
clear
that
the
magistrate
had
no
hesitation
in
committing
the
accused
for
trial
at
the
approaching
spring
term
of
court
in
default
of
bail
they
were
sent
back
to
prison
take
me
to
the
nursery
vi
grandma
elsie
said
when
the
departure
of
the
party
destined
for
the
magistrate
office
had
left
them
alone
together
i
feel
that
an
hour
with
my
little
grandchildren
will
be
quite
refreshing
the
darlings
are
scarcely
less
dear
to
me
than
were
their
mother
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
in
their
infancy
and
they
are
so
fond
of
you
mamma
responded
violet
leading
the
way
little
elsie
set
up
a
glad
shout
at
sight
of
her
grandmother
i
so
glad
i
so
glad
take
elsie
on
your
lap
and
tell
pitty
oh

the
very
first
minute

violet

grandma
lap

travilla
replied
fondly
caressing
the
little
prattler
what
story
shall
it
be
this
time
adam
and
eve
eatin
dat
apple
grandma
kindly
complied
telling
the
old
story
of
the
fall
in
simple
language
suited
to
the
infant
comprehension
of
the
baby
girl
who
listened
with
as
deep
an
interest
as
though
it
were
a
new
tale
to
her
instead
of
an
oft
repeated
one
on
its
conclusion
she
sat
for
a
moment
as
if
in
profound
thought
then
looking
up
into
her
grandmother
face
where
is
dey
now
she
asked
in
heaven
i
trust
elsie
goin
to
ask
dem
dat
when
elsie
gets
to
heaven
about
what
darling
eatin
dat
apple
what
dey
do
it
for
it
was
very
wicked
for
them
to
take
it
because
god
had
forbidden
them
to
do
so
yes
elsie
would
take
apple
if
papa
say
no
no
i
hope
not
it
is
very
naughty
for
children
to
disobey
their
papa
or
mamma
and
we
must
all
obey
god
our
heavenly
father
tell
elsie
heaven
yes
darling
i
will
it
is
a
beautiful
place
with
streets
of
gold
a
beautiful
river
and
trees
with
delicious
fruits
it
is
never
dark
for
there
is
no
night
there
because
jesus
our
dear
saviour
is
there
and
is
the
light
thereof
so
that
they
do
not
need
the
sun
or
moon
nobody
is
ever
sick
or
sorry
hungry
or
in
pain
nobody
is
ever
naughty
they
all
love
god
and
one
another
there
is
very
sweet
music
there
they
wear
white
robes
and
have
crowns
of
gold
on
their
heads
and
golden
harps
in
their
hands
to
make
sweet
music
yes
dey

white
dess
yes
do
dey

violet
laughed
at
that
question
she
is
very
desirous
to
have
her
dresses
fasten
in
front
like
mamma
she
explained
in
reply
to
her
mother
look
of
surprised
inquiry

her
grandma
answered

some

mamma
how
nicely

answer
or
parry
her
questions
said
violet
as
her
father
says
she
can
ask
some
that
a
very
wise
man
could
not
answer
yes
she
has
an
inquiring
mind
and
i
would
not
discourage
her
desire
to
learn
by
asking
questions
grandma
elsie
said
adding
with
a
smile
i
can
remember
that
her
mother
used
to
ask
me
some
very
puzzling
ones
twenty
years
ago
and
i
never
received
a
rebuff
but
was
always
answered
to
the
best
of
your
ability
dear
mamma
i
think
of
that
now
when
tempted
to
impatience
with
my
little
girl
sometimes
wearisome
questioning
and
resolve
to
try
to
be
as
good
a
mother
to
her
as
you
were
to
me
and
still
are
she
added
with
a
loving
smile
and
now
that
she
has
gone
back
to
her
play
and
baby
ned
is
sleeping
i
want
a
quiet
chat
with
you
then
let
us
go
to
your
boudoir
and
have
it
her
mother
answered
rising
and
moving
toward
the
door
mamma
i
have
not
heretofore
been
timid
about
burglars
violet
said
when
they
were
seated
in
the
boudoir
each
busied
with
a
bit
of
needlework
but
i
fear
that
i
shall
be
in
future
for
only
think
mamma
how
near
they
were
to
my
husband
and
myself
while
we
lay
sleeping
soundly
in
our
own
room
how
easily
they
might
have
murdered
us
both
before
we
were
even
aware
of
their
presence
in
the
house
could
they
had
you
then
no
wakeful
guardian
at
hand
o
mamma
yes
i
am
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
and
that
keepeth
israel
shall
neither
slumber
nor
sleep
and
yet
have
even
christians
sometimes
been
murdered
by
burglars
i
can
not
assert
that
they
have
not
replied
her
mother
to
your
faith
be
it
unto
you
and
even
true
christians
are
sometimes
lacking
in
faith
putting
their
trust
in
their
own
defences
or
some
earthly
helper
instead
of
the
keeper
of
israel
or
they
are
fearful
and
doubtful
refusing
to
take
god
at
his
word
and
rest
in
his
protecting
care
i
do
not
see
that
we
have
anything
to
do
with
the
question
you
propounded
just
now
we
have
only
to
take
god
promises
believe
them
fully
and
be
without
carefulness
in
regard
to
that
as
well
as
other
things
i
am
perfectly
sure
he
will
suffer
no
real
evil
to
befall
any
who
thus
trust
in
him
death
by
violence
may
sometimes
be
a
shorter
easier
passage
home
than
death
from
disease
and
come
in
whatever
shape
it
may
death
can
be
no
calamity
to
the
christian
solomon
tells
us
that
the
day
of
death
is
better
than
the
day
of
birth
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
my
dear
vi
i
think
one
who
can
claim
all
the
promises
of
god
to
his
children
should
be
utterly
free
from
the
fear
that
hath
torment
should
be
afraid
of
nothing
whatever
but
displeasing
and
dishonoring
god
yes
mamma
i
see
that
it
is
so
and
that
all
i
lack
to
make
me
perfectly
courageous
and
easy
in
mind
is
stronger
faith
i
think
my
husband
has
a
faith
which
lifts
him
above
every
fear
and
that
he
is
perfectly
content
to
leave
all
future
events
to
the
ordering
of
his
heavenly
father
grandma
elsie
eyes
shone
you
are
blest
in
having
such
a
husband
my
dear
vi
she
said
i
trust
you
will
help
each
other
on
in
the
heavenly
way
and
be
to
your
children
and
his
violet
looked
up
brightly
i
trust
we
shall
mamma
we
both
earnestly
desire
to
be
and
i
think
his
three
all
give
good
evidence
that
they
have
already
begun
to
walk
in
the
straight
and
narrow
way
and
no
wonder
considering
what
a
faithful
loving
christian
father
he
is
so
constant
in
prayer
and
effort
on
their
behalf
ah
as
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
on
the
driveway
they
have
returned
and
now
we
shall
have
a
report
of
all
that
was
done
in
the
magistrate
office
it
must
have
been
quite
an
ordeal
to
max
and
lulu
chapter
xvii
capt
raymond
was
met
at
the
door
by
the
youngest
two
of
his
daughters
papa
been
yaisin
seeds
announced
little
elsie
running
into
his
arms
yaisin
seeds
he
echoed
what
can
that
mean
she
means
seeding
raisins
papa
explained
grace
with
a
merry
laugh
we
been
in
the
kitchen
helping
the
cook
at
least
pretending
to
help
her
perhaps
we
hindered
more
than
we
helped
i
dare
say
he
responded
but
i
hope
elsie
did
eat
the
raisins
nor
you
either
they
are
quite
too
indigestible
for
your
young
stomachs
we
each
had
one
papa
that
was
all
i
told
elsie
we
would
eat
any
more
till
we
asked
leave
and
she
was
a
good
little
girl
and
tease
for
more
that
was
right
but
for
your
own
sakes
i
must
say
that
is
all
you
can
have
he
had
paused
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
to
pet
and
fondle
the
two
max
and
lulu
stood
looking
on
harold
and
herbert
were
taking
off
their
overcoats
near
by
you
a
funny
talker
elsie
laughed
max
your
english
is
not
of
the
purest
little
woman
said
her
uncle
harold
tell
uncle
harold
he
must
not
expect
perfection
in
a
beginner
said
her
father
where
are
grandma
and
mamma
in
the
parlor
i
believe
said
grace
oh
no
see
they
are
just
coming
down
the
stairs
yes
here
we
are
said
violet
anxious
for
a
report
of
the
proceedings
in
the
magistrate
office
wo
you
walk
into
the
parlor
gentlemen
and
let
us
have
it
certainly
we
will
be
very
happy
to
gratify
your
very
excusable
curiosity
returned
her
husband
laughingly
as
she
came
to
his
side
and
he
stooped
his
tall
form
to
give
her
the
kiss
with
which
he
never
failed
to
greet
her
after
even
a
brief
separation
the
older
people
all
repaired
to
the
parlor
but
the
children
did
not
follow
i
must
go
and
look
over
my
lessons
said
max
and
i
going
to
my
room
said
lulu
gracie
if
you
will
come
with
me
i
tell
you
all
about
the
trial
if
that
what
they
call
it
o
yes
do
responded
grace
as
the
two
started
up
the
stairs
together
were
you
scared
lu
no
i
did
feel
frightened
for
i
not
timid
you
know
and
papa
was
near
me
all
the
time
and
he
told
me
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
tell
a
straightforward
truthful
story
i
did
hate
to
take
the
oath
but
i
knew
i
had
to
and
that
it
wrong
though
it
does
seem
a
dreadful
thing
to
do
it
is
like
other
swearing
remarked
max
who
was
moving
on
up
the
stairs
somewhat
ahead
of
his
sisters
there
must
be
a
right
kind
because
in
the
psalms
where
david
is
describing
a
good
man
he
says
of
him
that
sweareth
to
his
own
hurt
and
changeth
not
yes
i
know
said
lulu
i
can
see
the
difference
and
this
must
be
the
right
kind
or
papa
would
never
have
let
us
do
it
how
do
they
do
it
asked
grace
how
did
you
do
it
lu
a
man
said
over
the
words
for
me
a
promise
to
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
i
promised
by
kissing
the
bible
that
was
all
that
was
very
hard
to
do
said
grace
but
oh
i
have
been
so
frightened
to
have
to
tell
something
with
so
many
people
listening
of
course
because
you
such
a
weak
timid
little
thing
but
i
big
and
strong
and
not
afraid
of
anybody
or
anything
there
were
a
good
many
people
there
the
room
was
quite
full
but
i
felt
that
that
did
not
make
much
difference
when
i
thought
about
god
hearing
every
word
i
said
and
knowing
if
it
was
really
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
ajax
wife
was
there
crying
fit
to
break
her
heart
too
specially
when
they
took
him
back
to
jail
papa
stopped
and
spoke
to
her
before
we
got
into
the
carriage
to
come
home
he
said
he
was
very
sorry
for
her
but
if
she
continued
to
be
honest
and
industrious
he
would
see
that
she
did
not
want
and
he
hoped
her
husband
would
some
day
come
out
of
prison
a
better
man
did
she
seem
thankful
to
papa
asked
grace
yes
and
she
said
she
did
see
how
ajax
could
be
so
bad
and
ungrateful
as
to
try
to
steal
papa
money
after
he
been
so
kind
to
her
and
the
children
yes
and
i
pity
for
being
his
wife
and
the
children
because
they
have
such
a
bad
father
lu
let
ask
papa
if
we
may
buy
some
calico
and
other
things
with
some
of
our
benevolence
money
and
make
clothes
for
them
i
would
mind
giving
the
money
said
lulu
but
i
hate
to
sew
on
such
things
you
know
i
never
did
like
plain
sewing
i
see
about
it
though
you
do
it
to
please
the
dear
lord
jesus
even
though
you
do
like
it
said
grace
softly
yes
that
i
will
if
papa
approves
returned
lulu
warmly
her
eyes
shining
gracie
it
good
a
real
pleasure
i
mean
to
make
yourself
do
distasteful
things
for
jesus
sake
i
put
my
hat
and
coat
in
their
proper
places
and
smooth
my
hair
so
i
be
neat
for
dinner
and
we
go
and
talk
to
papa
about
it
at
once
he
sure
to
approve
and
i
do
want
to
give
myself
any
chance
to
change
my
mind
and
give
the
thing
up
and
we
wo
mind
grandma
elsie
hearing
added
grace
perhaps
know
what
they
need
the
most
and
maybe
she
tell
rosie
and
eva
and
they
offer
to
do
something
for
the
poor
things
too
oh
yes
perhaps
we
can
form
ourselves
into
a
dorcas
society
what
they
call
societies
that
make
garments
for
the
poor
you
know
because
of
dorcas
in
the
bible
who
made
coats
and
garments
for
the
poor
where
she
lived
yes
lu
but
there
the
dinner
bell
and
we
have
to
wait
awhile
before
we
can
talk
to
papa
about
it
for
you
know
he
says
we
talk
a
great
deal
at
the
table
when
there
company
and
i
have
to
smooth
my
hair
yet
and
that
will
make
me
late
i
so
sorry
because
it
vexes
papa
to
have
us
unpunctual
do
wait
for
me
gracie
for
that
will
make
you
late
too
i
rather
wait
for
you
but
i
i
ought
to
go
at
once
gracie
said
looking
regretfully
back
as
she
left
the
room
the
blessing
had
been
asked
and
the
captain
was
carving
the
turkey
when
lulu
took
her
seat
at
the
table
which
was
close
at
his
right
hand
he
gave
her
a
grave
look
i
very
sorry
i
late
papa
she
said
in
a
low
tone
and
casting
down
her
eyes
i
been
so
busy
talking
with
gracie
that
i
had
my
hair
smoothed
when
the
bell
rang
it
has
been
a
very
exciting
morning
for
you
daughter
and
i
excuse
you
this
time
he
returned
speaking
kindly
and
in
as
low
a
key
as
her
own
it
is
not
often
i
find
you
unpunctual
lulu
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
her
countenance
brightened
and
her
eyes
were
lifted
to
her
father
face
with
a
grateful
loving
look
that
brought
a
smile
to
his
lips
and
eyes
she
was
very
quiet
during
the
meal
speaking
only
when
spoken
to
but
her
father
kept
an
eye
on
her
plate
and
saw
that
her
wants
were
abundantly
supplied
on
leaving
the
table
all
repaired
to
the
parlor
and
lulu
and
grace
seizing
the
first
opportunity
offered
them
by
a
pause
in
the
talk
of
their
elders
told
of
their
plan
and
asked
permission
to
carry
it
out
it
was
received
with
entire
approval
by
all
present
their
father
included
i
have
no
doubt
that
rosie
and
evelyn
will
be
glad
to
join
you
in
forming
a
dorcas
society
said
grandma
elsie
and
if
you
like
i
shall
be
happy
to
cut
out
garments
for
you
to
work
upon
and
to
teach
you
how
to
do
it
for
yourselves
oh
thank
you
responded
the
little
girls
we
were
sure
you
would
and
it
will
be
ever
so
nice
taridge
tumin
two
taridge
tumin
cried
little
elsie
who
had
climbed
on
a
chair
and
was
gazing
out
of
a
window
looking
upon
the
drive
they
proved
to
be
the
ion
and
fairview
carriages
bringing
the
whole
family
of
the
latter
place
and
all
of
the
other
who
were
not
already
present
we
have
come
in
a
body
as
you
see
to
learn
all
about
the
strange
occurrences
of
last
night
and
the
consequent
doings
in
the
office
this
morning
grandpa
dinsmore
remarked
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
captain
and
kissed
violet
first
on
one
cheek
then
on
the
other
tiss
elsie
too
danpa
cried
the
little
one
toddling
up
to
him
oo
must
fordet
to
tiss
oor
dirl
certainly
not
he
said
taking
her
into
his
arms
to
kiss
her
several
times
then
sitting
down
with
her
on
his
knee
do
you
know
that
you
are
my
ess
elsie
knows
dat
she
answered
nodding
her
curly
head
wisely
meantime
greetings
had
been
exchanged
among
the
others
and
the
four
little
girls
had
got
into
a
corner
by
themselves
o
lu
do
tell
us
all
about
it
cried
rosie
i
never
did
hear
of
such
a
brave
girl
as
you
why
i
have
been
scared
to
death
and
never
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
going
down
where
the
burglars
were
oh
i
think
you
would
if
you
been
in
my
place
returned
lulu
modestly
you
see
i
was
afraid
if
i
waited
to
tell
papa
about
them
they
might
come
out
and
see
him
ready
to
fight
them
and
kill
him
but
i
thought
if
i
could
get
the
door
shut
and
fastened
on
them
before
they
knew
anybody
was
there
nobody
would
be
hurt
and
that
the
way
it
was
said
evelyn
but
you
a
brave
girl
and
there
no
use
in
your
denying
it
yes
indeed
you
were
said
rosie
but
come
now
do
tell
us
the
whole
story
we
want
to
hear
it
fresh
from
your
lips
and
what
went
on
in
the
magistrate
office
too
added
eva
oh
did
you
dislike
having
to
go
there
and
testify
yes
i
begged
papa
not
to
make
me
but
he
said
it
was
the
law
and
not
he
that
insisted
yes
i
know
and
of
course
those
things
have
to
be
done
in
such
cases
but
i
hope
my
turn
will
never
come
now
lu
please
begin
you
have
at
least
two
very
attentive
listeners
more
than
that
i
think
said
rosie
as
other
voices
were
heard
in
the
hall
quickly
followed
by
the
entrance
of
the
relatives
from
the
oaks
the
pines
and
roselands
and
greetings
were
scarcely
exchanged
with
these
when
the
families
from
ashlands
and
the
laurels
joined
the
circle
so
that
quite
a
large
surprise
party
had
gathered
there
unexpectedly
to
themselves
as
well
as
to
their
hosts
the
same
desire
to
learn
the
full
particulars
of
what
had
reached
them
as
little
more
than
a
vague
report
had
brought
them
all
these
were
given
and
lulu
received
so
much
commendation
and
was
so
lauded
for
her
bravery
that
her
father
began
to
fear
she
would
be
puffed
up
with
vanity
and
conceit
but
at
length
that
subject
was
dropped
and
the
one
of
the
proposed
dorcas
society
taken
up
evelyn
seemed
quietly
pleased
and
interested
zoe
lora
and
rosie
ready
to
enter
into
the
work
with
enthusiasm
while
the
dinsmore
girls
gave
a
rather
languid
attention
to
the
discussion
but
when
it
had
been
decided
to
organize
a
society
on
the
spot
and
the
business
of
electing
officers
was
taken
up
they
roused
themselves
to
a
new
interest
and
maud
was
evidently
gratified
when
evelyn
nominated
her
for
the
secretaryship
lulu
seconded
the
motion
and
maud
was
unanimously
elected
zoe
had
already
been
made
president
lora
was
chosen
treasurer
these
were
all
the
officers
considered
necessary
but
sydney
evelyn
and
lulu
were
appointed
a
committee
to
visit
the
poor
families
in
the
neighborhood
and
learn
what
articles
of
clothing
were
most
needed
by
them
it
was
decided
that
the
society
should
meet
once
a
fortnight
at
one
or
the
other
of
the
homes
of
its
members
taking
them
in
turn
that
at
these
meetings
reports
should
be
given
in
as
to
the
state
of
the
finances
work
done
and
articles
needed
finished
garments
would
also
be
brought
in
examined
and
pronounced
upon
as
well
or
ill
done
the
members
would
busy
themselves
in
cutting
and
basting
new
garments
while
together
and
each
carry
home
with
her
one
or
more
to
be
made
in
the
interval
between
that
and
the
next
meeting
also
each
member
was
to
consider
herself
under
appointment
to
invite
her
young
girl
or
young
lady
friends
from
other
families
to
join
with
them
in
the
good
work
now
i
think
that
is
all
said
grandma
elsie
you
are
fully
organized
and
i
invite
you
to
hold
your
first
meeting
at
ion
next
wednesday
afternoon
that
will
give
time
for
ascertaining
the
needs
of
some
of
those
we
wish
to
assist
and
the
purchase
of
materials
but
how
are
your
funds
to
be
raised
asked
her
father
by
a
tax
on
the
members
and
contributions
from
their
friends
which
will
be
thankfully
accepted
she
said
with
a
pleased
smile
as
he
took
out
his
and
handed
her
a
five
dollar
bill
we
are
very
much
obliged
sir
the
captain
and
other
gentlemen
present
some
of
the
ladies
also
immediately
followed
dinsmore
example
then
the
question
of
the
amount
of
tax
on
the
members
was
discussed
and
settled
after
that
the
captain
said
he
had
a
suggestion
to
make
namely
that
it
would
be
well
for
the
little
girls
to
be
accompanied
by
an
older
person
when
making
their
visits
to
their
proposed
beneficiaries
it
will
require
some
wisdom
and
tact
to
make
the
necessary
investigations
without
wounding
the
feelings
of
those
they
desire
to
benefit
or
injuring
their
commendable
pride
of
independence
he
said
in
conclusion
thank
you
for
the
advice
captain
grandma
elsie
replied
i
think
it
most
wise
what
have
the
members
of
the
society
to
say
about
it
all
responded
promptly
that
they
would
prefer
to
have
an
older
person
with
them
on
those
occasions
and
we
better
begin
that
business
said
zoe
that
whoever
is
to
do
the
buying
of
materials
to
be
cut
and
basted
at
the
first
meeting
may
have
the
needed
information
in
season
i
hope
grandma
elsie
will
buy
the
things
said
lulu
do
you
all
vote
for
that
girls
yes
yes
indeed
if
she
will
they
all
answered
and
were
pleased
that
she
at
once
consented
to
do
so
are
we
boys
to
be
shut
out
of
all
this
asked
max
i
do
see
why
we
should
take
hold
of
such
work
as
well
as
the
girls
i
conceited
enough
to
think
i
could
wield
a
pair
of
shears
and
cut
out
garments
by
a
pattern
or
under
instruction
and
i
know
i
can
run
a
sewing
machine
for
i
tried
it
and
certainly
we
could
all
help
with
the
financial
part
said
chester
dinsmore
let
take
them
in
said
sydney
we
want
all
the
money
we
can
get
of
course
we
do
said
lora
the
more
money
we
have
the
more
good
we
may
hope
to
do
the
others
seemed
to
see
the
force
of
the
argument
and
voted
unanimously
for
the
admission
of
the
lads
what
about
home
and
foreign
missionary
societies
asked
evelyn
i
thought
we
had
decided
to
have
one
of
each
just
among
ourselves
was
it
the
girls
only
or
will
the
boys
take
part
in
them
too
of
course
we
will
if
you
let
us
replied
max
and
you
ca
have
too
much
money
for
them
seeing
there
are
millions
upon
millions
of
heathen
to
be
taught
and
furnished
with
bibles
yes
said
the
captain
boys
should
be
as
much
interested
in
mission
work
as
girls
and
i
see
no
reason
why
you
young
relatives
and
friends
should
not
work
together
but
with
your
studies
and
other
duties
to
attend
to
you
have
hardly
time
for
such
a
multiplication
of
societies
and
as
the
work
is
one
the
field
the
world
i
propose
that
you
form
only
one
more
society
which
shall
be
for
both
home
and
foreign
missions
a
very
good
plan
i
think
commented
grandpa
dinsmore
and
i
propose
that
we
proceed
at
once
to
organize
such
a
society
said
zoe
and
should
we
have
gentlemen
officers
asked
lulu
i
think
uncle
harold
would
make
a
good
president
thank
you
said
he
smiling
pleasantly
on
her
but
i
could
not
serve
because
i
must
be
off
to
college
directly
and
the
same
objection
applies
to
all
of
us
except
max
and
little
walter
added
chester
dinsmore
we
older
lads
can
only
pay
our
dues
and
perhaps
meet
with
you
occasionally
when
at
home
on
a
vacation
working
for
the
good
cause
in
the
meantime
in
whatever
place
we
are
added
harold
shall
we
proceed
to
organize
asked
zoe
yes
if
grandma
elsie
will
help
us
as
she
did
with
the
dorcas
said
lulu
the
others
joined
in
the
request
and
grandma
elsie
kindly
complied
eva
was
chosen
president
rosie
treasurer
and
they
would
have
made
lulu
secretary
but
that
she
strenuously
declined
insisting
that
she
was
not
ready
enough
with
her
pen
to
find
time
for
that
in
addition
to
all
the
sewing
and
other
things
she
was
undertaking
then
i
nominate
max
said
rosie
giving
him
a
bright
look
and
smile
and
i
second
the
motion
said
evelyn
max
made
no
objection
and
seemed
gratified
when
he
was
pronounced
unanimously
elected
they
then
settled
the
amount
of
their
yearly
subscription
to
each
cause
and
the
time
of
meeting
deciding
that
it
should
be
on
the
same
day
and
hour
as
the
meeting
of
the
other
society
but
on
the
alternate
week
and
what
will
we
do
at
our
meetings
asked
sydney
what
other
people
do
at
missionary
meetings
i
presume
answered
zoe
read
the
bible
sing
hymns
pray
for
the
missionaries
and
the
heathen
at
home
and
abroad
pay
in
our
dues
too
said
max
and
i
suppose
each
one
will
try
to
find
some
interesting
article
to
take
to
the
meeting
to
be
read
aloud
to
the
others
yes
of
course
we
must
all
do
that
if
we
want
to
have
very
enjoyable
meetings
said
zoe
and
we
older
people
must
see
to
it
that
you
are
well
supplied
with
literature
bearing
on
the
subject
said
the
captain
he
was
rejoiced
to
perceive
that
the
interest
of
these
new
enterprises
was
taking
his
children
thoughts
from
the
unpleasant
occurrences
of
the
previous
night
almost
all
their
talk
with
him
that
evening
when
the
guests
had
gone
and
the
babies
were
being
put
to
bed
was
of
the
work
they
hoped
to
do
in
connection
with
their
missionary
and
dorcas
societies
to
lulu
had
been
assigned
the
duty
of
visiting
the
family
of
ajax
for
the
purpose
of
learning
what
were
their
most
pressing
needs
in
the
line
of
clothing
speaking
of
it
she
asked
ought
i
not
to
go
papa
and
will
you
go
with
me
i
say
yes
to
both
questions
he
replied
you
may
be
ready
for
your
call
directly
we
are
done
with
school
duties
that
will
give
us
time
to
go
and
return
in
good
season
for
dinner
yes
sir
i
be
ready
thank
you
very
much
for
promising
to
take
me
liza
must
feel
lonesome
thinking
about
ajax
in
jail
remarked
grace
thoughtfully
but
i
glad
he
there
so
that
he
be
trying
to
break
into
anybody
house
papa
could
he
get
out
and
come
here
again
it
is
hardly
possible
answered
her
father
looking
tenderly
down
into
her
face
and
smoothing
her
curls
with
caressing
hand
and
he
would
not
want
to
hurt
you
if
he
could
come
into
the
house
i
do
see
how
any
one
could
wish
to
harm
my
gentle
kindhearted
little
grace
papa
shall
i
sleep
in
her
bed
with
her
asked
lulu
certainly
if
she
would
like
it
oh
i
should
grace
exclaimed
i
know
our
heavenly
father
will
take
care
of
me
but
it
good
to
feel
lu
arms
round
me
too
then
you
shall
said
lulu
giving
her
an
affectionate
pat
your
big
sister
likes
to
take
care
of
you
chapter
xviii
o
lu
tell
me
all
about
it
exclaimed
grace
when
lulu
came
home
the
next
day
from
her
visit
to
eliza
are
they
very
very
poor
and
needy
and
her
children
well
not
so
very
because
papa
has
been
seeing
to
them
for
quite
a
while
they
had
a
good
fire
was
ironing
for
somebody
and
pretty
good
clothes
but
the
children
are
growing
too
big
for
some
of
their
things
and
have
torn
or
worn
holes
in
others
so
papa
says
he
thinks
we
should
make
them
some
new
ones
i
going
to
ask
grandma
elsie
to
buy
some
flannel
with
some
of
my
money
and
let
me
make
a
skirt
for
the
baby
i
like
to
make
an
apron
for
one
of
the
little
girls
said
grace
well
i
suppose
you
can
there
are
two
girls
and
a
boy
besides
the
baby
just
think
what
a
lot
of
trouble
it
must
be
to
keep
them
all
clothed
and
fed
and
poor
will
have
to
do
it
all
herself
while
ajax
is
in
jail
i
do
believe
he
was
much
help
anyhow
said
lulu
with
a
scornful
little
toss
of
her
head
she
says
he
did
work
half
the
time
and
was
always
getting
drunk
and
beating
her
and
the
children
i
should
think
she
want
him
kept
in
jail
as
long
as
he
lives
but
maybe
he
grow
good
and
be
kind
and
helpful
to
her
when
he
gets
out
papa
will
do
all
he
can
to
make
him
good
said
lulu
he
gone
now
to
the
jail
to
talk
to
him
just
think
of
his
taking
so
much
trouble
for
such
an
ungrateful
wretch
it
very
good
in
him
responded
grace
and
it
being
like
the
dear
lord
jesus
to
take
trouble
to
do
good
to
ungrateful
wretches
yes
so
it
is
and
nobody
can
be
acquainted
with
papa
without
seeing
that
he
tries
always
to
be
like
jesus
the
captain
motive
for
visiting
the
jail
that
day
was
certainly
most
kind
and
christian
a
desire
to
reason
with
the
two
prisoners
on
the
sin
and
folly
of
their
evil
courses
and
persuade
them
to
repentance
and
reformation
he
did
not
approach
them
in
a
spirit
for
the
thought
in
his
heart
was
it
is
only
the
grace
of
god
that
maketh
us
to
differ
and
with
the
same
heredity
and
like
surroundings
and
influences
i
might
have
been
even
a
greater
criminal
than
they
but
he
found
them
sullen
and
defiant
and
by
no
means
grateful
for
his
kindly
interest
in
their
welfare
still
he
continued
his
efforts
visiting
them
frequently
while
they
lay
in
the
county
jail
awaiting
trial
lulu
looked
forward
to
the
trial
with
some
apprehension
dreading
to
be
placed
on
the
before
the
judges
jurymen
lawyers
and
the
crowd
of
spectators
likely
to
be
present
on
the
occasion
it
be
a
great
great
deal
worse
than
that
time
in
the
office
she
said
to
herself
again
and
again
but
by
her
father
advice
she
tried
to
put
away
the
thought
of
it
and
give
her
mind
to
other
things
she
was
interested
in
her
studies
amusements
in
the
books
and
periodicals
furnished
for
the
profit
and
entertainment
of
herself
and
brother
and
sister
and
in
the
young
people
societies
just
started
in
the
connection
these
prospered
and
grew
by
the
addition
of
new
members
from
among
the
young
folks
who
though
of
the
neighborhood
were
yet
outside
of
the
connection
under
grandma
elsie
wise
and
kindly
instruction
several
of
the
older
members
soon
became
quite
expert
in
preparing
work
for
themselves
and
the
others
also
in
gathering
up
information
on
the
subject
of
missions
and
in
regard
to
the
needy
of
their
own
vicinity
thus
their
meetings
were
made
interesting
were
well
attended
and
looked
forward
to
with
pleasure
while
quite
an
amount
of
good
was
accomplished
through
their
means
the
woodburn
children
were
never
willing
to
miss
a
meeting
and
took
pride
and
pleasure
in
doing
their
full
share
of
the
sewing
undertaken
by
the
dorcas
society
that
was
a
more
congenial
task
to
grace
than
to
lulu
but
the
latter
partly
from
pride
partly
from
a
real
desire
to
be
useful
insisted
each
time
on
carrying
home
at
least
as
much
work
as
gracie
did
and
for
some
weeks
she
was
very
faithful
with
her
task
but
after
that
her
interest
in
that
particular
work
began
to
flag
and
she
delayed
doing
it
giving
her
time
and
thoughts
to
other
matters
till
at
last
gracie
reminded
her
that
there
was
but
a
day
left
in
which
to
do
it
if
the
garment
were
to
be
ready
for
handing
in
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
society
oh
dear
cried
lulu
i
forgot
the
time
was
so
short
and
how
i
ever
to
finish
it
so
soon
i
do
see
i
have
to
take
all
my
play
time
for
it
i
wish
i
could
help
you
gracie
said
with
a
very
sympathizing
look
but
you
know
papa
said
i
must
do
any
more
than
my
own
of
course
not
returned
lulu
emphatically
your
own
is
too
much
for
such
a
feeble
little
thing
as
you
and
do
you
worry
about
me
manage
it
somehow
but
how
can
you
you
have
that
composition
to
write
and
two
lessons
to
learn
to
recite
to
papa
in
the
morning
i
should
think
they
would
take
all
your
afternoon
except
what
has
to
be
given
to
exercise
and
dinner
time
now
i
study
hard
and
try
to
get
the
lessons
and
composition
all
done
before
dark
and
then
i
sew
as
fast
as
i
can
all
the
evening
while
papa
is
reading
or
talking
to
mamma
vi
and
us
i
afraid
it
more
than
you
can
do
returned
grace
with
a
doubtful
shake
of
the
head
and
perhaps
somebody
may
come
in
to
interrupt
us
too
if
they
do
i
just
go
on
with
the
sewing
not
stopping
even
if
there
are
games
to
be
played
and
i
asked
to
take
part
it
very
nice
in
you
to
be
so
determined
commented
grace
giving
her
sister
an
admiring
affectionate
look
it
about
time
i
was
determined
to
do
that
sewing
said
lulu
laughing
a
little
for
i
put
it
off
over
and
over
again
because
i
wanted
to
indulge
myself
in
playing
games
or
reading
a
story
the
ringing
of
the
dinner
bell
put
a
stop
to
their
talk
at
the
table
the
captain
said
to
his
wife
that
business
called
him
to
the
city
he
must
start
directly
the
meal
was
over
and
would
not
be
able
to
get
home
till
late
long
after
the
usual
bedtime
but
he
did
not
want
any
one
to
sit
up
for
him
as
he
could
let
himself
in
with
his
latch
key
o
papa
cried
lulu
i
like
to
sit
up
for
you
if
i
may
no
my
child
he
said
with
his
pleasant
smile
i
quite
appreciate
the
kind
feeling
that
prompts
that
offer
but
i
want
you
to
go
to
your
bed
at
the
usual
hour
papa
observed
max
insinuatingly
and
with
an
arch
look
it
hurt
a
boy
to
sit
up
and
wait
for
his
father
i
not
so
sure
of
that
laughed
the
captain
boys
need
sleep
as
well
as
girls
and
should
not
be
deprived
of
their
regular
allowance
when
there
is
no
necessity
how
about
wives
asked
violet
with
a
twinkle
of
fun
in
her
eye
wives
are
of
course
not
under
orders
he
returned
gallantly
but
are
free
to
do
as
they
please
but
i
should
be
loath
to
have
mine
miss
her
beauty
sleep
then
i
suppose
she
should
try
to
take
it
for
your
sake
laughed
violet
papa
i
wish
you
did
ever
have
to
go
away
sighed
grace
we
shall
miss
so
much
the
fun
with
the
babies
and
the
nice
talk
with
you
while
they
are
being
put
to
bed
and
then
the
reading
afterwards
i
have
not
said
anything
about
taking
the
babies
with
me
and
really
have
no
thought
of
doing
so
as
they
would
not
be
likely
to
prove
of
assistance
in
transacting
my
business
returned
her
father
gravely
at
that
everybody
laughed
and
violet
said
to
gracie
so
you
see
dearie
you
need
not
despair
of
some
fun
with
the
babies
maybe
not
mamma
but
it
wo
be
just
the
same
as
when
papa
is
with
us
and
while
you
are
away
putting
them
to
bed
we
miss
papa
ever
so
much
i
hope
so
he
said
smiling
on
her
it
is
pleasant
to
feel
that
absence
is
regretted
but
my
dear
little
daughter
we
ca
expect
to
have
all
our
enjoyments
every
day
no
sir
said
lulu
and
we
miss
you
when
mamma
vi
comes
back
and
you
are
not
there
to
read
to
us
of
course
we
will
said
violet
but
though
your
papa
is
unquestionably
the
finest
reader
among
us
the
rest
of
us
can
read
intelligibly
and
some
of
us
can
read
aloud
to
the
others
perhaps
we
may
take
turns
a
very
good
plan
said
the
captain
but
my
dear
i
can
not
endorse
that
statement
of
yours
in
regard
to
our
relative
ability
as
readers
i
consider
my
wife
as
fine
a
reader
as
i
ever
listened
to
mamma
vi
does
read
beautifully
remarked
max
with
an
affectionate
admiring
glance
at
her
i
think
so
too
assented
lulu
adding
and
if
she
will
read
to
us
it
will
be
a
great
favor
and
i
am
sure
will
make
the
time
pass
quickly
and
very
pleasantly
no
doubt
said
the
captain
and
i
am
glad
you
are
ready
to
appreciate
such
an
effort
on
your
mamma
part
but
she
may
have
other
plans
for
the
evening
violet
had
intended
to
spend
it
in
writing
to
her
absent
brothers
but
instantly
decided
to
sacrifice
her
own
wishes
to
those
of
the
children
i
am
sure
i
shall
enjoy
reading
to
so
appreciative
an
audience
she
said
laughingly
and
feel
myself
highly
honored
in
filling
my
place
max
and
lulu
said
the
captain
do
forget
the
tasks
set
for
this
afternoon
you
can
easily
accomplish
them
before
tea
and
have
an
hour
or
more
for
exercise
beside
both
replied
with
a
promise
not
to
forget
or
neglect
his
requirements
and
immediately
upon
bidding
her
father
and
seeing
him
out
of
sight
lulu
went
to
her
room
and
applied
herself
to
the
study
of
her
lessons
first
then
to
the
writing
of
her
composition
she
did
her
work
hurriedly
however
with
the
thought
of
the
sewing
for
which
she
now
had
so
little
time
ever
present
with
her
consequently
the
lessons
took
small
hold
upon
her
memory
and
the
remaining
task
was
very
indifferently
performed
she
was
in
the
act
of
wiping
her
pen
when
max
called
to
her
and
grace
that
the
ponies
were
at
the
door
and
they
three
and
mamma
vi
were
to
have
a
ride
together
oh
how
nice
cried
both
little
girls
and
hastened
to
don
riding
hats
and
habits
they
had
grown
exceedingly
fond
of
their
young
and
as
she
did
not
very
often
find
it
convenient
to
share
their
rides
to
have
her
do
so
was
considered
quite
a
treat
on
their
return
lulu
hardly
waiting
to
remove
her
out
door
garments
and
make
herself
presentable
for
the
evening
went
at
the
sewing
with
all
the
activity
and
determination
of
her
very
energetic
nature
it
got
to
be
done
if
i
have
to
work
like
a
steam
engine
she
exclaimed
to
grace
thrusting
in
and
drawing
out
her
needle
with
a
rapidity
that
surprised
her
little
sister
i
never
saw
you
sew
so
fast
lu
she
said
i
could
do
it
i
have
to
take
more
time
to
be
sure
my
stitches
were
nice
and
even
oh
it
for
poor
folks
and
so
it
strong
it
wo
make
much
difference
about
the
looks
returned
lulu
working
away
at
the
same
headlong
pace
but
grandma
elsie
is
particular
about
the
stitches
said
grace
you
remember
she
told
us
she
was
for
our
own
sakes
more
than
the
poor
folks
because
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
for
us
to
fall
into
slovenly
habits
of
working
yes
i
do
remember
now
you
speak
of
it
and
i
try
to
make
the
work
neat
as
well
as
to
do
it
fast
lulu
worked
on
not
allowing
herself
a
moment
rest
or
relaxation
till
the
tea
bell
rang
violet
invited
them
all
to
spend
the
evening
in
her
boudoir
lulu
carried
her
sewing
there
directly
after
leaving
the
table
and
violet
more
than
once
spoke
admiringly
of
the
diligence
and
energy
she
displayed
in
working
steadily
on
till
it
was
time
for
them
to
separate
for
the
night
it
is
done
yet
dear
me
how
many
stitches
it
does
take
to
make
a
garment
sighed
lulu
to
grace
when
they
had
retired
to
the
room
of
the
latter
so
it
does
said
grace
but
papa
says
having
to
take
so
many
of
them
one
right
after
another
is
a
good
lesson
in
patience
and
perseverance
kind
of
lessons
i
not
fond
of
laughed
lulu
and
you
worked
so
hard
all
the
evening
you
must
be
very
tired
yes
i
tired
but
i
sit
up
and
work
an
hour
or
two
longer
if
it
would
be
disobedience
to
papa
well
i
see
how
much
i
can
do
before
breakfast
morning
perhaps
i
can
finish
i
hope
i
can
she
carried
out
her
resolution
and
when
their
father
came
in
for
the
customary
bit
of
chat
with
his
little
daughters
before
breakfast
he
found
her
sewing
diligently
he
commended
her
industry
particularly
when
grace
had
told
how
much
of
it
had
been
shown
the
previous
evening
but
added
that
he
hoped
the
tasks
he
had
set
her
had
been
first
properly
attended
to
yes
sir
i
learned
my
lessons
and
wrote
my
composition
yesterday
before
i
began
the
sewing
she
replied
that
is
well
he
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
willing
to
use
some
of
your
leisure
time
in
working
for
the
poor
but
your
education
which
is
to
fit
you
for
greater
usefulness
in
the
future
must
not
be
neglected
for
that
or
anything
else
lulu
blushed
with
a
sudden
half
conviction
that
her
tasks
had
not
been
so
faithfully
attended
to
as
they
should
have
been
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
remedy
the
failure
as
the
school
hour
would
come
very
soon
after
breakfast
and
family
worship
she
wished
she
had
learned
her
lessons
more
thoroughly
and
spent
more
time
and
pains
upon
her
composition
but
hoped
she
might
be
able
to
acquit
her
herself
better
on
being
called
to
recite
than
she
feared
however
it
proved
a
vain
hope
she
hesitated
and
gave
incorrect
answers
several
times
in
the
first
recitation
and
when
it
came
to
the
second
showed
herself
almost
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
lesson
her
father
looked
very
grave
but
only
said
as
he
handed
back
her
book
these
are
the
poorest
recitations
i
have
ever
heard
from
you
then
taking
up
her
composition
which
he
had
found
lying
on
his
desk
and
had
already
examined
and
this
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
say
is
a
piece
of
work
that
does
no
credit
to
my
daughter
the
writing
is
slovenly
the
sentences
are
badly
constructed
and
the
spelling
is
very
faulty
it
must
be
this
afternoon
and
both
lessons
learned
so
that
you
can
recite
them
creditably
to
me
before
i
can
allow
you
any
recreation
i
do
care
she
said
with
a
pout
and
a
frown
i
just
have
too
much
to
do
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
my
child
are
you
speaking
quite
as
respectfully
as
you
ought
in
addressing
your
father
he
asked
in
grave
reproving
accents
she
hung
her
head
in
sullen
silence
he
waited
a
moment
then
said
with
some
sternness
when
i
ask
you
a
question
lucilla
i
expect
an
answer
and
it
must
be
given
no
sir
it
was
respectful
she
replied
penitently
but
please
forgive
me
papa
i
hope
i
never
speak
so
again
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
tenderly
i
do
dear
child
but
now
i
must
know
what
you
mean
by
saying
that
you
have
too
much
to
do
it
that
sewing
for
the
dorcas
society
papa
beside
all
my
lessons
and
practising
and
other
things
that
you
bid
me
do
every
day
then
you
must
undertake
less
of
it
or
none
at
all
for
as
i
have
said
before
your
lessons
are
of
much
more
importance
i
can
pay
some
one
to
work
for
the
poor
but
my
little
girl
stock
of
knowledge
must
be
increased
and
her
mind
improved
by
her
own
efforts
i
do
want
to
give
it
up
papa
because
it
would
be
mortifying
to
have
it
said
i
could
do
as
much
as
the
other
girls
you
seem
to
be
doing
charitable
work
from
a
very
poor
motive
he
remarked
in
a
tone
of
grave
concern
papa
that
is
my
only
motive
she
replied
hanging
her
head
and
blushing
i
do
want
to
please
the
lord
jesus
and
to
be
kind
and
helpful
to
the
poor
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
but
you
must
be
willing
to
undertake
less
if
you
can
not
do
so
much
without
neglecting
other
and
more
important
duties
did
you
bring
home
an
extra
quantity
of
work
from
the
last
meeting
of
your
society
no
sir
and
she
blushed
again
as
she
spoke
but
i
i
kept
putting
off
doing
it
because
there
was
always
something
else
i
wanted
to
do
a
story
to
read
or
a
game
to
play
or
a
bit
of
carving
or
something
pleasanter
than
sewing
till
grace
reminded
me
there
was
only
one
day
left
and
then
i
hurried
over
my
lessons
and
composition
and
worked
as
hard
and
fast
as
i
could
at
the
sewing
ah
he
said
it
is
an
old
and
very
true
saying
that
is
the
thief
of
time
the
only
way
to
accomplish
much
in
this
world
is
to
have
a
time
for
each
duty
and
always
attend
to
it
at
that
set
time
if
you
want
to
go
on
with
this
dorcas
work
you
must
set
apart
some
particular
time
for
it
when
it
will
not
interfere
with
other
duties
and
resolve
not
to
allow
yourself
to
use
that
time
for
anything
else
unless
my
father
orders
me
she
said
half
inquiringly
half
in
assertion
and
with
an
arch
look
and
smile
yes
there
may
be
exceptions
to
the
rule
he
replied
returning
the
smile
now
we
have
talked
long
enough
on
this
subject
and
must
begin
to
put
in
practice
the
rule
i
have
just
laid
down
yes
sir
i
have
my
ciphering
to
do
now
but
papa
must
i
learn
the
lessons
over
and
rewrite
the
composition
this
afternoon
if
you
say
i
must
i
have
to
miss
the
meeting
of
our
society
i
be
very
sorry
for
that
and
ashamed
to
have
to
tell
why
i
was
there
please
papa
wo
you
let
me
go
and
do
my
work
over
after
i
get
back
there
be
an
hour
or
more
before
tea
and
then
all
the
evening
he
did
not
answer
immediately
and
she
added
with
a
wistful
pleading
look
i
know
i
do
deserve
to
be
let
go
but
you
often
been
a
great
deal
better
to
me
than
i
deserved
as
i
well
may
be
considering
how
far
beyond
my
deserts
are
my
blessings
he
said
with
a
tender
smile
and
another
kiss
yes
daughter
you
may
attend
the
meeting
and
i
shall
hope
to
hear
some
excellent
recitations
from
you
before
you
go
to
your
bed
oh
thank
you
dear
papa
i
try
my
very
hardest
she
exclaimed
joyously
giving
him
a
vigorous
hug
the
society
met
at
ion
that
day
the
captain
and
violet
drove
over
with
the
children
and
leaving
them
there
while
they
went
on
some
miles
farther
called
for
them
again
on
their
return
at
the
close
of
the
hour
appropriated
to
its
exercises
grandma
elsie
face
hardly
expressed
approval
as
she
examined
work
but
she
let
it
pass
only
saying
in
a
low
aside
to
the
little
girl
it
is
not
quite
so
well
done
as
the
last
garment
you
brought
in
my
child
but
i
will
overlook
the
partial
failure
hoping
the
next
bit
of
work
will
be
an
improvement
upon
both
lulu
blushed
and
was
silent
once
she
would
have
made
an
angry
retort
but
she
was
slowly
learning
patience
and
humility
on
arriving
at
home
she
set
immediately
to
work
at
her
tasks
nor
left
off
till
the
tea
bell
rang
the
time
had
been
too
short
for
her
to
make
much
progress
and
it
was
quite
a
trial
to
have
to
spend
the
whole
evening
in
her
own
room
while
the
others
were
enjoying
the
usual
pleasant
hours
of
relaxation
together
the
sport
with
the
babies
the
familiar
chat
and
interesting
reading
but
that
too
she
bore
with
patience
it
was
not
till
the
call
to
evening
worship
that
she
joined
the
family
when
the
service
was
over
she
drew
near
her
father
papa
i
have
that
composition
and
hope
you
will
find
it
a
great
deal
better
i
have
studied
my
lessons
too
till
i
think
i
can
recite
them
creditably
ah
that
is
well
he
said
laying
a
hand
tenderly
on
her
head
and
smiling
affectionately
down
into
the
eyes
upraised
to
his
i
will
go
with
you
presently
to
hear
the
lessons
and
examine
your
little
essay
when
he
had
done
so
i
am
very
glad
indeed
daughter
he
said
to
be
able
to
bestow
hearty
praise
on
you
this
time
you
have
greatly
improved
your
composition
and
your
recitations
were
quite
perfect
he
drew
her
to
his
knee
as
he
spoke
she
blushing
with
pleasure
at
his
words
i
missed
my
eldest
daughter
from
the
family
circle
this
evening
he
went
on
smoothing
her
hair
caressingly
indeed
i
think
we
all
missed
her
i
hope
we
will
not
be
deprived
of
her
company
in
the
same
way
again
i
hope
not
papa
i
do
mean
to
be
more
faithful
in
preparing
my
lessons
i
sure
i
ought
when
i
have
such
a
kind
kind
teacher
she
added
looking
lovingly
into
his
eyes
dear
papa
putting
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
laying
her
cheek
to
his
i
do
love
you
so
much
my
darling
he
responded
your
love
is
very
precious
to
me
and
i
do
think
it
can
be
greater
than
mine
for
you
my
daughter
worth
to
her
fond
father
could
not
be
computed
in
dollars
and
cents
he
added
with
a
happy
laugh
i
hope
grandma
elsie
found
your
sewing
well
done
not
so
very
papa
she
replied
her
tone
expressing
some
mortification
she
said
it
was
not
so
nicely
done
as
the
last
that
is
a
pity
it
will
hardly
do
to
keep
on
so
going
backward
instead
of
forward
as
regards
improvement
in
that
line
of
work
no
papa
i
do
mean
to
i
did
bring
home
quite
so
much
this
time
though
some
of
the
girls
did
look
as
if
they
thought
i
was
growing
lazy
and
it
was
dreadfully
mortifying
to
have
them
think
so
and
going
to
try
eva
plan
she
says
she
divides
her
work
into
as
many
portions
as
there
are
days
to
do
it
in
and
wo
let
herself
miss
doing
at
least
one
portion
each
day
she
says
she
gets
it
done
quite
easily
in
that
way
often
finished
before
the
day
when
it
is
to
be
handed
in
but
it
ca
be
that
she
puts
it
off
for
games
and
what
not
no
sir
and
i
do
mean
to
any
more
i
put
that
sewing
first
after
what
you
say
are
more
important
duties
and
not
let
myself
have
any
play
till
it
done
i
think
i
can
always
do
it
before
breakfast
now
that
you
do
require
me
to
sweep
or
dust
my
own
rooms
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
papa
for
saying
i
need
do
those
things
any
more
while
i
have
so
many
lessons
i
want
my
daughters
to
understand
all
kinds
of
housework
so
that
they
may
be
competent
to
direct
servants
if
they
have
them
or
be
independent
of
them
if
they
have
not
he
said
but
now
that
you
have
learned
how
to
sweep
and
dust
i
do
not
think
it
necessary
for
you
to
make
use
of
that
knowledge
while
your
time
can
be
better
employed
and
i
am
able
to
pay
a
servant
for
doing
the
work
chapter
xix
one
morning
at
breakfast
max
asked
papa
have
you
told
lu
yet
no
replied
the
captain
i
wished
her
to
eat
her
meal
first
in
peace
and
comfort
therefore
i
am
sorry
you
spoke
as
i
see
you
have
roused
her
curiosity
yes
papa
may
i
know
what
you
are
talking
about
asked
lulu
giving
him
a
disturbed
rather
apprehensive
look
oh
does
the
court
meet
it
been
meeting
for
several
days
returned
max
and
the
trial
of
our
burglars
comes
up
and
we
have
to
attend
as
witnesses
yes
but
you
need
be
alarmed
you
ought
to
be
quite
used
to
it
since
your
experience
in
the
magistrate
office
answered
max
sportively
i
do
think
i
ever
get
used
to
it
and
i
just
wish
there
was
some
way
to
keep
out
of
it
sighed
lulu
but
as
there
is
my
little
girl
will
make
up
her
mind
to
go
through
with
it
bravely
the
captain
said
giving
her
an
encouraging
smile
i
try
papa
she
answered
but
with
a
sigh
that
sounded
rather
hopeless
violet
and
grace
both
expressed
their
sympathy
but
were
sure
lulu
would
do
herself
credit
as
she
had
on
the
former
occasion
lulu
brightened
a
little
and
went
on
with
her
meal
how
soon
do
we
have
to
go
papa
she
asked
in
about
half
an
hour
after
breakfast
he
answered
that
will
take
us
to
the
town
for
the
opening
of
session
of
the
court
we
may
not
be
called
on
for
our
testimony
for
hours
but
must
be
at
hand
in
case
we
are
wanted
lulu
wasted
no
more
breath
in
vain
wishes
or
objections
but
her
usual
flow
of
spirits
had
deserted
her
as
they
drove
toward
the
town
her
father
noticed
that
she
was
very
quiet
and
that
her
face
wore
a
look
of
patient
resignation
and
fortitude
as
if
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
courageously
through
a
difficult
and
trying
ordeal
do
be
anxious
and
troubled
dear
child
he
said
taking
her
hand
and
pressing
it
affectionately
in
his
you
are
not
going
alone
into
that
crowded
court
room
no
papa
and
i
ever
so
glad
you
will
be
with
me
and
not
only
i
dear
but
a
nearer
dearer
more
powerful
friend
jesus
says
i
am
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
he
says
it
to
every
one
of
his
disciples
and
that
always
must
include
this
time
that
you
are
dreading
he
will
be
close
beside
you
and
you
can
ask
him
at
any
instant
for
the
help
you
need
to
know
exactly
what
to
say
and
do
the
help
to
be
calm
and
collected
and
to
answer
clearly
and
perfectly
truthfully
every
question
put
to
you
papa
it
so
nice
to
think
of
that
she
exclaimed
looking
up
brightly
and
with
glad
tears
shinning
in
her
eyes
thank
you
so
very
much
for
reminding
me
of
it
now
i
shall
not
be
at
all
afraid
even
if
the
lawyers
do
ask
me
hard
puzzling
questions
as
i
read
in
the
papers
that
they
do
to
witnesses
sometimes
no
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
am
not
afraid
for
you
for
i
am
sure
you
will
be
helped
to
say
just
what
you
ought
and
if
as
i
believe
will
happen
you
are
enabled
to
acquit
yourself
well
remember
when
people
commend
you
for
it
that
having
done
so
by
help
from
on
high
the
honor
is
not
fairly
due
to
you
and
you
have
no
reason
to
be
conceited
and
vain
in
consequence
i
hope
i
be
kept
from
being
that
papa
she
returned
i
think
that
for
anybody
with
as
good
a
memory
as
mine
having
told
a
straightforward
truthful
story
is
anything
to
be
puffed
up
about
no
certainly
not
the
wealth
and
standing
in
the
community
of
captain
raymond
and
his
wife
relatives
caused
a
widespread
interest
in
the
case
about
to
be
tried
especially
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
he
and
two
of
his
children
were
to
be
placed
upon
the
witness
stand
to
testify
to
the
identity
of
the
burglars
and
their
attempt
to
rob
his
house
the
court
house
was
crowded
and
there
were
very
many
of
the
better
class
of
people
among
the
spectators
including
members
of
the
families
residing
at
the
oaks
the
laurels
the
pines
ion
fairview
and
roselands
conly
and
edward
travilla
and
leland
were
there
when
the
woodburn
party
arrived
and
presently
grandpa
dinsmore
and
his
wife
and
cousin
ronald
who
was
still
staying
at
ion
followed
these
all
sat
near
together
and
lulu
felt
it
a
comfort
to
find
herself
in
the
midst
of
such
a
company
of
friends
greetings
were
exchanged
some
kind
encouraging
words
spoken
to
her
and
max
then
their
father
and
the
other
gentlemen
fell
into
conversation
the
children
had
never
been
in
a
before
and
were
interested
in
looking
about
and
observing
what
was
going
on
they
were
early
in
season
to
see
the
judges
come
in
and
take
their
seats
on
the
bench
and
the
opening
of
the
court
some
lesser
matters
occupied
its
attention
for
a
time
then
there
was
a
little
stir
of
excitement
in
the
crowd
as
the
sheriff
and
his
deputy
entered
with
ajax
and
his
fellow
burglar
but
it
quieted
down
in
a
moment
as
the
prisoners
took
their
places
at
the
bar
and
the
voice
of
the
presiding
judge
sounded
distinctly
through
the
room
commonwealth
against
perry
davis
and
ajax
stone
burglary
are
you
ready
for
trial
we
are
your
honor
replied
the
district
attorney
very
well
said
the
judge
arraign
the
prisoners
then
the
two
prisoners
were
told
to
stand
up
while
the
district
attorney
read
the
indictment
which
charged
them
with
burglariously
breaking
and
entering
into
the
of
captain
raymond
of
woodburn
on
the
second
day
of
january
last
passed
and
while
there
attempting
to
break
into
and
rob
his
safe
and
to
carry
off
articles
of
value
from
other
parts
of
the
dwelling
the
was
very
quiet
during
the
reading
of
the
indictment
so
that
max
and
lulu
who
were
listening
intently
heard
every
word
lulu
looked
her
astonishment
when
the
prisoners
pleaded
not
guilty
why
they
and
they
know
they
are
she
whispered
to
max
of
course
he
returned
in
the
same
low
key
but
do
you
suppose
men
who
break
into
houses
to
steal
will
hesitate
to
lie
oh
no
to
be
sure
not
how
silly
i
am
the
next
thing
was
the
selecting
of
jurors
a
rather
tedious
business
taking
up
all
the
rest
of
the
time
till
the
court
adjourned
for
the
noon
recess
that
was
a
rest
for
max
and
lulu
their
father
took
them
to
a
hotel
for
lunch
they
chatted
a
while
in
its
parlor
after
satisfying
their
appetites
then
returned
to
the
in
season
for
the
opening
of
the
afternoon
session
the
district
attorney
made
the
opening
address
giving
an
outline
of
the
evidence
he
expected
to
bring
forward
to
prove
the
prisoners
guilt
then
lulu
was
called
to
the
witness
stand
she
rose
at
once
and
turned
to
her
father
looking
a
trifle
pale
but
quite
calm
and
collected
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
to
the
little
railed
platform
she
stepped
upon
it
and
he
stood
near
to
encourage
her
by
his
presence
you
are
very
young
my
child
the
judge
said
in
a
kindly
tone
what
do
you
know
of
the
nature
of
an
oath
i
know
sir
that
it
is
a
very
solemn
promise
in
the
presence
of
the
great
god
to
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
what
will
happen
to
you
if
you
fail
to
do
so
my
dear
god
will
know
it
and
be
angry
with
me
for
he
hates
lying
and
has
said
liars
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
that
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
lulu
answers
were
given
in
a
low
but
very
distinct
tone
and
in
the
almost
breathless
silence
were
quite
audible
in
every
part
of
the
large
room
administer
the
oath
to
her
said
the
judge
addressing
the
clerk
of
the
court
she
is
more
competent
to
take
it
than
many
an
older
person
when
she
had
done
so
what
is
your
name
asked
the
district
attorney
lucilla
raymond
you
are
the
daughter
of
capt
levis
raymond
late
of
united
states
navy
yes
sir
his
eldest
daughter
how
old
are
you
i
was
twelve
on
my
last
birthday
last
summer
look
at
the
prisoners
did
you
ever
see
them
before
yes
sir
when
and
where
the
colored
man
has
lived
in
our
family
and
i
saw
him
every
day
for
months
and
the
white
man
i
have
seen
him
three
times
before
first
on
the
second
day
of
last
january
when
my
brother
and
i
were
riding
home
through
the
bit
of
wood
on
my
father
estate
that
man
was
leaning
against
a
tree
and
my
pony
nearly
stepped
on
him
before
i
knew
he
was
there
and
he
seized
her
bridle
and
said
fiercely
out
there
and
do
ride
a
fellow
down
and
what
did
you
answer
let
go
of
my
bridle
this
instant
and
get
out
of
the
path
plucky
laughed
some
one
in
the
audience
what
happened
next
asked
the
lawyer
and
lulu
went
on
to
tell
the
whole
story
of
the
adventure
in
the
wood
that
you
have
told
us
was
your
first
sight
of
the
prisoner
calling
himself
perry
davis
when
did
you
see
him
next
and
where
that
night
in
what
we
call
the
strong
room
where
papa
safe
is
she
was
bidden
to
tell
the
whole
of
that
story
also
and
did
so
in
the
same
clear
straightforward
manner
in
which
she
had
told
it
in
the
magistrate
office
told
it
simply
artlessly
as
not
aware
of
the
bravery
and
unselfishness
of
her
conduct
in
attempting
the
capture
of
the
burglars
at
the
risk
of
being
attacked
and
murdered
by
them
and
in
the
same
calm
even
distinct
tones
in
which
she
had
spoken
at
first
a
murmur
of
admiration
ran
through
the
as
she
concluded
her
narrative
with
papa
was
asleep
and
i
could
speak
just
at
first
for
want
of
breath
but
when
i
put
my
arm
round
his
neck
and
laid
my
face
on
the
pillow
beside
his
he
woke
and
i
told
him
about
the
burglars
and
what
i
had
done
the
prisoners
had
listened
with
close
attention
and
evident
interest
so
was
her
that
chit
of
a
gal
that
fastened
us
in
caught
us
in
a
trap
as
one
may
say
muttered
davis
scowling
at
her
and
grinding
his
teeth
with
rage
pity
i
did
hold
on
to
that
ere
bridle
and
kerry
her
off
afore
we
ventur
in
thar
a
warning
look
from
his
counsel
silenced
him
and
the
latter
addressed
himself
to
lulu
you
say
you
had
seen
davis
three
times
before
where
and
when
did
you
see
him
the
third
time
in
the
magistrate
office
the
next
morning
after
he
and
ajax
had
been
in
our
house
did
you
then
recognize
them
as
the
same
men
you
had
seen
in
the
strong
room
of
your
home
the
night
before
at
work
at
the
lock
of
the
safe
yes
sir
and
davis
as
the
man
who
had
seized
my
pony
bridle
in
the
wood
but
you
had
not
seen
ajax
stone
face
how
then
could
you
recognize
him
no
i
had
not
seen
his
face
but
i
had
the
back
of
his
head
and
how
he
was
dressed
and
i
knew
i
had
fastened
him
in
there
and
that
he
get
out
till
the
sheriff
took
him
out
and
then
i
heard
his
voice
and
knew
it
was
ajax
voice
the
went
on
it
was
what
lulu
had
dreaded
but
it
did
not
seem
to
embarrass
or
disturb
her
nor
could
she
be
made
to
contradict
herself
her
father
eyes
shone
he
looked
a
proud
and
happy
man
as
he
led
her
back
to
her
seat
holding
her
hand
in
a
tender
loving
clasp
she
was
surprised
and
pleased
to
find
grandma
elsie
and
violet
sitting
with
the
other
relatives
and
friends
they
had
come
in
while
she
was
on
the
witness
stand
dear
child
violet
said
making
room
for
her
by
her
side
you
went
through
your
ordeal
very
successfully
and
i
am
very
glad
for
your
sake
that
it
is
over
yes
my
dear
we
are
all
proud
of
you
added
grandma
elsie
smiling
kindly
upon
the
little
girl
but
there
was
not
time
for
anything
more
max
raymond
some
one
called
here
sir
replied
the
lad
rising
take
the
witness
stand
go
my
son
and
let
us
see
how
well
you
can
acquit
yourself
the
captain
said
in
an
encouraging
tone
and
max
obeyed
he
conducted
himself
quite
to
his
father
satisfaction
behaving
in
a
very
manly
way
and
giving
his
testimony
in
the
same
clear
distinct
tones
and
straightforward
manner
that
had
been
admired
in
his
sister
but
having
much
less
to
tell
he
was
not
kept
nearly
so
long
upon
the
stand
there
were
other
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
one
of
whom
was
capt
raymond
himself
he
testified
that
the
burglars
had
evidently
entered
the
house
through
a
window
by
prying
open
a
shutter
removing
a
pane
of
glass
then
reaching
in
and
turning
the
catch
over
the
lower
sash
when
the
evidence
on
that
side
had
all
been
heard
the
counsel
for
the
accused
opened
the
case
for
the
defense
he
was
an
able
and
eloquent
lawyer
but
his
clients
had
already
established
an
unenviable
reputation
for
themselves
and
the
weight
of
the
evidence
against
them
was
too
strong
for
rebuttal
their
conviction
was
a
foregone
conclusion
in
his
mind
and
that
of
almost
every
one
present
even
before
he
began
his
speech
he
had
but
few
witnesses
to
bring
forward
and
their
testimony
was
unimportant
and
availed
nothing
as
disproof
of
that
given
by
those
for
the
prosecution
after
the
lawyers
on
both
sides
had
addressed
the
jury
and
the
judge
had
delivered
his
charge
to
them
they
retired
to
consider
their
verdict
in
a
few
moments
they
returned
and
resumed
their
seats
in
the
jury
box
they
found
both
the
accused
guilty
of
burglary
and
the
trial
was
over
is
it
quite
finished
papa
lulu
asked
as
they
were
driving
toward
home
again
what
my
child
the
trial
yes
there
will
be
no
more
of
it
i
so
glad
she
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
of
relief
you
said
they
would
have
to
go
to
the
penitentiary
if
they
were
found
guilty
and
the
jury
said
they
were
how
long
will
they
have
to
stay
there
i
do
know
they
have
not
been
sentenced
yet
but
it
will
be
for
some
years
i
sorry
for
them
i
wish
they
had
been
so
wicked
so
do
i
and
that
i
had
had
to
testify
against
them
i
ca
help
feeling
as
though
it
was
unkind
and
that
their
friends
have
a
right
to
hate
me
for
it
no
not
at
all
it
was
a
duty
you
owed
the
community
because
to
allow
criminals
to
go
unpunished
would
make
honest
people
unsafe
and
indeed
to
the
men
themselves
as
being
brought
to
justice
may
prove
the
means
of
their
reformation
so
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
it
my
darling
try
to
forget
the
whole
unpleasant
affair
and
be
happy
in
the
enjoyment
of
your
many
blessings
there
one
thing
that
helps
to
make
my
conscience
perfectly
easy
on
the
score
of
having
testified
against
them
remarked
max
and
that
is
i
could
help
myself
but
had
to
obey
the
law
true
enough
rejoined
his
father
and
lulu
was
no
more
a
free
agent
than
yourself
no
sir
but
she
did
more
to
catch
the
rogues
than
anybody
else
max
went
on
giving
her
a
merry
