editor
atlanta
dear
sir
i
am
writing
to
invoke
your
kind
assistance
in
tracing
an
old
family
negro
of
mine
who
disappeared
in
between
my
stock
farm
in
floyd
county
and
my
home
place
locally
known
as
tommeysville
in
jefferson
county
the
negro
name
was
eneas
a
small
old
fellow
and
very
talkative
the
unexpected
movement
of
our
army
after
the
battle
of
resaca
placed
my
stock
farm
in
line
of
the
federal
advance
and
exposed
my
family
to
capture
my
command
tommey
legion
passing
within
five
miles
of
the
place
i
was
enabled
to
give
them
warning
and
they
hurriedly
boarded
the
last
train
they
reached
jefferson
county
safely
but
without
any
baggage
as
they
did
not
have
time
to
move
a
trunk
an
effort
was
made
to
save
the
family
silver
much
of
it
very
old
and
highly
prized
especially
a
silver
cup
known
in
the
family
as
the
bride
cup
for
some
six
or
eight
generations
and
bearing
the
inscription
ye
bryde
whose
lippes
kysse
myne
and
taste
ye
water
an
no
wyne
shall
happy
live
an
hersel
see
a
happy
grandchile
on
each
knee
these
lines
were
surrounded
with
a
wreath
and
surmounted
by
a
head
visor
down
and
the
motto
semper
fidelis
this
cup
was
hurriedly
packed
with
other
silver
in
a
hair
trunk
and
intrusted
to
eneas
with
verbal
instructions
as
to
travel
he
drove
an
blooded
mare
to
a
wagon
full
of
forage
and
carried
all
the
confederate
money
the
family
left
to
pay
his
expenses
he
was
last
seen
as
i
ascertained
soon
after
the
war
from
a
wounded
member
of
my
command
about
eight
miles
southeast
of
atlanta
asleep
in
the
wagon
the
mare
turning
to
the
right
instead
of
keeping
the
straight
road
to
macon
eneas
was
a
faithful
negro
born
and
raised
in
the
tommey
family
and
our
belief
is
he
was
murdered
by
army
stragglers
and
robbed
of
the
trunk
he
had
never
been
over
the
road
he
was
traveling
as
we
always
traveled
to
north
georgia
by
rail
shipping
the
horses
likewise
his
geographical
knowledge
consisted
of
a
few
names
places
to
which
i
had
at
different
times
taken
him
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
my
home
such
as
macon
sparta
louisville
and
the
counties
of
washington
and
jefferson
if
given
a
chance
to
talk
he
would
probably
confine
himself
to
lady
chain
the
mare
he
was
driving
lightning
the
noted
stallion
temporarily
in
my
possession
the
tommey
family
and
our
settlement
tommeysville
on
these
topics
he
could
talk
eighteen
hours
a
day
i
have
no
hope
of
ever
seeing
eneas
again
for
if
living
he
would
have
gotten
back
if
he
had
to
travel
all
over
the
south
to
do
it
but
there
is
a
bare
chance
that
the
cup
may
be
found
and
i
am
writing
to
gratify
my
daughter
whose
wedding
day
is
approaching
all
brides
in
the
family
since
have
used
this
cup
on
their
wedding
days
if
the
cup
was
stolen
doubtless
the
thieves
sold
it
and
if
so
the
holder
may
read
these
lines
if
they
are
given
publicity
i
am
willing
to
waive
any
question
of
ownership
and
purchase
the
cup
at
the
holder
valuation
if
within
my
power
or
if
unwilling
to
sell
he
may
loan
the
cup
for
a
few
days
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
will
publish
this
letter
with
a
request
that
all
southern
papers
daily
and
weekly
copy
the
same
thanking
you
in
advance
and
with
all
good
wishes
for
your
happiness
and
prosperity

am
most
respectfully

geo
tommey
louisville
dear
major
tommey
i
read
with
deep
interest
and
sympathy
your
letter
in
the
inquiring
of
a
negro
named
eneas
this
man
i
am
sure
came
to
my
house
about
twenty
miles
south
of
atlanta
in
i
remember
the
occasion
perfectly
because
he
mentioned
your
name
and
one
of
my
boys
was
serving
in
your
command
i
gave
him
shelter
for
the
night
and
food
for
himself
and
horse
he
insisted
on
sleeping
in
his
wagon
he
told
me
that
the
mare
was
famous
on
the
race
track
and
very
valuable
and
he
was
afraid
to
leave
her
this
struck
me
as
singular
at
the
time
because
she
seemed
old
and
broken
down
i
did
not
see
any
trunk
but
his
wagon
was
full
of
hay
and
fodder
and
he
may
have
had
one
hidden
under
it
eneas
asked
me
to
put
him
on
the
road
to
thomasville
or
so
i
understood
him
and
i
gave
him
explicit
directions
as
far
as
newnan
advising
him
to
get
more
at
that
point
he
was
gone
when
i
arose
next
morning
i
do
hope
you
will
find
the
old
man
as
well
as
the
cup
i
took
quite
a
fancy
to
him
he
gave
me
a
very
vivid
description
of
yourself
whom
i
had
long
wished
to
meet
and
of
your
home
the
house
lawn
with
its
three
fountains
beautiful
lake
and
your
hundred
negroes
in
their
painted
cottages
etc
excuse
this
rambling
letter
your
name
has
stirred
an
old
memories
sincerely
your
friend
martha
horton
my
son
william
who
served
in
your
command
married
a
connecticut
girl
think
of
it
major
but
she
proved
to
be
a
woman
and
has
influenced
him
to
give
up
tobacco
and
stimulants
in
every
form
he
travels
this
territory
for
a
new
york
house
his
wife
is
well
connected
and
one
of
her
ancestors
came
over
in
the
mayflower
she
is
with
me
now
and
sends
you
her
regards
billy
has
convinced
her
that
next
to
general
joseph
johnston
you
were
the
bravest
man
in
the
georgia
armies
talbotton
major
george
tommey
louisville
sir
read
your
letter
in
the
i
kept
a
livery
stable
here
in
and
saw
the
man
you
are
huntin
about
that
time
he
drove
a
broken
down
old
speckled
grey
mare
he
called
lady
chain
now
that
you
mention
it
and
claimed
she
was
in
foal
to
lightning
the
great
horse
i
took
this
for
a
joke
along
with
some
of
the
fairy
stories
he
gave
me
about
the
tommeys
but
he
was
so
polite
and
humble
that
i
let
him
stay
over
night
in
the
stable
offered
to
pay
me
next
morning
an
seemed
like
he
had
about
a
bushel
of
confedrit
money
but
i
was
long
on
confed
myself
and
did
let
him
put
any
more
on
me
do
remember
seein
any
trunk
he
was
on
his
way
to
thomasville
so
he
said
and
i
giv
him
as
much
directions
as
he
could
carry
very
truly
william
peters
thomas
county
major
george
tommey
louisville
dear
sir
my
wife
remembered
your
old
nigger
as
soon
as
she
read
your
letter
in
the
paper
and
so
did
i
when
she
called
it
to
my
mind
he
was
a
big
talker
all
right
and
sat
on
our
back
steps
half
the
night
talking
about
the
tommeys
their
race
horse
house
yard
with
six
fountains
and
a
whole
tribe
of
niggers
we
fed
him
and
he
slept
in
his
wagon
next
day
he
wanted
to
pay
me
in
confederate
money
was
using
a
corn
sack
for
a
pocketbook
and
it
was
most
full
he
moved
on
to
thomasville
about
six
miles
from
here
but
i
do
think
it
was
the
place
he
was
looking
for
i
reckon
it
must
have
been
tommeysville
he
was
looking
for
major
i
took
a
good
look
at
lady
chain
and
you
lost
much
if
you
never
get
her
back
but
if
you
do
find
the
nigger
you
lost
the
champion
liar
of
georgia
i
hope
you
get
him
back
but
it
hardly
possible
a
man
talking
like
he
did
could
last
seven
years
on
the
public
road
respectfully
abner
cummings
thomasville
hon
sir
and
major
your
man
eneas
came
to
my
home
in
thomasville
in
the
winter
of
or
the
fall
of
in
great
distress
he
said
he
had
traveled
a
thousand
miles
to
get
to
thomasville
but
it
was
the
right
thomasville
he
had
no
idea
of
states
geography
or
direction
claimed
he
lived
in
jefferson
county
next
to
washington
county
and
as
this
describes
two
counties
across
the
line
in
florida
several
people
at
different
times
had
sent
him
over
there
i
gave
him
a
letter
to
a
friend
over
in
jefferson
county
near
tallahassee
he
had
an
old
grey
mare
he
said
was
a
famous
race
horse
but
she
did
look
it
claimed
she
was
in
foal
to
the
celebrated
lightning
whose
race
in
the
mud
at
new
orleans
i
witnessed
i
thought
the
old
nigger
was
loose
in
the
upper
story
he
had
no
trunk
when
here
very
truly
andrew

major

tommey
tommeysville
via
louisville
my
dear
sir
eneas
your
old
negro
whose
name
i
had
forgotten
until
i
read
your
letter
in
a
local
paper
was
on
my
plantation
near
here
in
he
came
here
very
blue
and
utterly
discouraged
from
thomasville
said
he
was
looking
for
a
little
thomasville
owned
by
major
george
tommey
he
brought
a
letter
from
a
friend
of
mine
there
are
no
tommeys
in
this
county
and
no
thomasville
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
him
i
passed
him
along
to
colonel
chairs
a
friend
in
washington
county
which
is
on
the
gulf
coast
chairs
wrote
me
that
he
had
had
a
great
deal
of
fun
out
of
eneas
the
gulf
astonished
him
he
declared
solemnly
that
he
knew
he
was
in
the
wrong
washington
because
there
were
no
oranges
or
scrub
palmettoes
or
big
green
spiders
crabs
in
his
and
the
water
had
no
salt
in
it
eneas
talked
a
good
deal
of
macon
and
louisville
and
there
being
a
county
and
town
so
named
besides
another
thomasville
to
the
north
in
alabama
chairs
started
him
up
that
way
i
am
truly
sorry
the
old
man
came
to
grief
he
was
a
harmless
old
fellow
though
a
picturesque
liar
as
are
many
old
negroes
when
they
talk
of
their
white
folks
it
is
possible
that
eneas
had
a
trunk
but
i
have
no
recollection
of
seeing
one
in
his
possession

dear
sir
your
negro
eneas
came
to
my
place
in
this
county
in
i
think
from
a
little
village
named
thomasville
to
the
northeast
he
was
very
poor
and
his
pathetic
story
appealed
to
my
sympathies
i
let
him
have
some
rations
and
a
piece
of
land
and
he
planted
a
cotton
crop
he
married
a
young
mulatto
woman
on
my
place
that
year
and
when
he
left
here
about
christmas
carried
with
him
a
young
baby
besides
the
old
mare
and
her
colt
the
colt
by
the
way
was
a
beauty
eneas
was
a
puzzle
to
me
though
i
have
lived
among
negroes
all
my
life
his
stories
of
you
and
your
place
were
marvels
but
for
the
fact
that
he
held
the
mare
and
colt
in
your
name
refusing
dozens
of
offers
for
the
latter
when
in
dire
need
i
should
have
put
him
down
a
reckless
romancer
he
began
preaching
here
among
the
negroes
and
proved
to
be
a
most
eloquent
spiritual
advocate
he
claimed
to
be
the
pastor
of
a
big
congregation
at
home
i
heard
him
on
one
occasion
when
he
baptized
forty
converts
and
was
thrilled
by
his
imagery
and
power
eneas
knew
nothing
of
geography
beyond
the
names
of
a
few
towns
and
counties
hearing
of
a
macon
and
louisville
over
in
mississippi
he
gathered
his
household
goods
into
his
wagon
in
december
i
do
hope
you
will
yet
find
him
suppose
you
make
inquiries
through
the
african
methodist
church
he
ought
to
be
a
bishop

this

came
in
a
wagon
drawn
by
an
old
grey
mare
he
called
lady

and
followed
by
a
splendid
young
colt
he
declared
was
from
celebrated
racing
stock
an
almost
worn
out
pass
from
his
mistress
tommey
though
it
bore
no
date
or
address
saved
the
old
man
from
arrest
his
story
that
he
was
lost
and
on
his
way
home
though
remarkable
was
possible
and
he
was
not
molested
the
narrative
of
his
wanderings
interested
me
greatly
he
came
up
the
river
the
mississippi
from
jefferson
county
trying
to
find
a
ford
he
had
heard
of
a
washington
parish
and
a
thomasville
in
louisiana
and
was
trying
to
reach
them
he
rented
a
piece
of
land
near
here
and
raised
a
crop
leaving
in
for
jefferson
county
alabama
i
gave
him
a
letter
to
a

in
that
county
very
truly
rev

i
regret
to
say
that
after
leaving
here
eneas
though
an
active
minister
of
the
gospel
suffered
the
young
horse
to
be
entered
in
a
county

was
trying
to

my
dear
sir
eneas
was
here
in
or
and
remained
about
a
year
preaching
at
mt
zion
and
other
places
in
the
county
i
do
not
know
when
i
ever
met
a
more
original
and
entertaining
talker
his
description
of
your
colonial
house
with
its
forty
rooms
white
columns
and
splendid
parks
has
aroused
in
me
a
strong
desire
to
visit
the
place
if
i
am
ever
able
to
come
to
georgia
i
know
it
must
have
suffered
from
the
ravages
of
the
war
but
doubtless
enough
remains
to
show
its
former
magnificence
i
am
especially
anxious
to
see
the
great
lake
with
its
flock
of
swans
and
the
twelve
fountains
on
your
lawn
my
mother
is
a
georgian
and
have
often
heard
her
describe
the
natural
beauties
of
the
state
there
is
a
feeling
with
us
all
that
at
last
it
is
home
and
that
some
day
we
shall
all
assemble
in
dear
old
monroe
county
where
grandpa
was
born
eneas
brought
with
him
to
this
place
a
grey
mare
that
was
he
said
a
famous
race
horse
and
that
the
father
of
her
colt
was
the
greatest
horse
in
the
world
i
had
forgotten
their
names
until
i
read
your
letter
eneas
insisted
that
you
lived
at
thomasville
next
to
washington
and
jefferson
counties
and
near
a
town
named
louisville
there
are
towns
and
counties
of
the
same
names
in
this
state
and
he
left
to
visit
them
he
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
money
i
hope
you
will
hear
from
him
yet
but
i
am
afraid
the
trunk
is
gone
he
had
none
when
here
sincerely
yours
mary
adkins
louisville
sir
do
you
worry
about
old
eneas
he
came
here
in
or
about
with
a
grey
mare
a
race
horse
a
young
wife
and
three
children
and
give
out
that
he
was
a
minister
of
the
gospel
they
stayed
on
my
place
and
there
were
four
children
when
they
left
he
was
a
preacher
all
right
cause
i
heard
him
time
and
again
but
all
the
same
he
was
the
biggest
liar
in
tennessee
at
that
time
and
that
a
great
record
for
any
man
major
if
half
he
said
about
you
and
your
place
is
true
you
ought
to
be
president
you
must
have
owned
all
the
niggers
in
georgia
and
your
home
must
be
spread
over
all
three
of
them
counties
he
has
been
looking
for
ever
since
freedom
about
that
lightning
colt
he
certainly
looks
it
eneas
slipped
him
into
a
up
here
and
him
and
a
strange
white
man
about
busted
the
county
i
offered
him
for
the
colt
but
he
said
your
price
was
considering
you
had
never
seen
him
i
thought
that
a
little
high
and
him
and
me
trade
next
day
he
was
gone
oh
you
eneas
say
major
if
he
ever
gets
back
and
he
will
for
you
ca
lose
that
kind
of
man
for
good
better
nail
down
everything
movable
including
them
twelve
fountains
yours
tom
johnson
i
say
twelve
fountains
rooms
gosh
is
the
legion
still
with
you
washington
county
george
tommey
louisville
my
dear
major
your
old
negro
has
been
on
my
plantation
for
about
a
year
farming
and
preaching
and
romancing
he
came
straight
through
tennessee
and
north
carolina
touching
sparta
louisville
washington
and
jefferson
counties
in
the
former
and
the
towns
of
jefferson
sparta
and
macon
in
this
state
before
he
found
me
i
am
affectionately
known
all
over
this
section
of
the
state
as
major
tommy
and
as
the
old
negro
was
looking
for
major
tommey
somebody
put
him
on
my
trail
he
soon
had
me
treed
but
was
greatly
disappointed
when
he
saw
me
however
that
did
not
keep
him
from
paying
me
a
year
visit
eneas
is
a
queer
character
wisdom
of
the
serpent
and
simplicity
of
a
child
his
story
probably
growing
with
age
like
the
stories
of
some
of
our
veterans
has
beguiled
many
a
lonely
hour
for
me
but
not
until
i
read
your
letter
in
the
did
i
give
him
credit
for
many
facts
in
it
the
young
race
horse
is
certainly
a
fine
animal
and
should
you
decide
to
sell
him
i
trust
you
will
give
me
the
refusal
eneas
won
several
purses
up
here
in
local
races
it
seems
he
has
a
new
name
for
his
horse
everywhere
he
goes
he
says
it
keeps
him
from
getting
too
common
when
eneas
was
not
plowing
or
racing
his
favorite
occupation
was
preaching
his
subject
usually
being
the
wandering
of
the
hebrews
in
the
desert
he
left
here
for
jefferson
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
heard
no
mention
of
your
lost
cup
and
if
he
had
any
trunk
i
was
not
informed
of
it
with
regards
for
yourself
and
all
good
wishes
for
the
young
bride
i
am
very
sincerely
yours
thomas
bailey
late
major
volunteers
extract
from
october
one
of
the
surprises
of
yesterday
races
came
in
the
dash
which
was
won
by
chainlightning
entered
by
an
old
negro
man
calling
himself
eneas
tommey
who
claims
the
horse
was
sired
by
the
celebrated
stallion
lightning
and
that
the
dam
which
he
drives
to
a
wagon
on
his
way
to
georgia
is
lady
chain
she
was
certainly
a
tired
looking
old
lady
eneas
arrived
late
and
at
once
attracted
attention
by
his
unique
appearance
and
his
limitless
faith
in
chainlightning
his
story
and
the
splendid
horse
interested
some
stablemen
and
after
a
private
demonstration
they
succeeded
in
getting
him
entered
and
a
rider
engaged
in
the
chainlightning
took
the
lead
and
gave
a
marvelous
exhibition
of
speed
he
led
the
bunch
by
a
hundred
yards
at
the
end
of
the
first
mile
and
by
nearly
three
hundred
at
the
end
of
the
second
he
was
then
going
strong
and
the
efforts
of
the
rider
to
stop
him
resulted
in
a
runaway
when
he
came
around
the
third
time
the
crowd
blocked
the
track
and
brought
him
to
a
standstill
but
his
rider
was
thrown
eneas
won
it
is
not
known
how
his
backers
fared
but
it
is
supposed
that
they
cleaned
up
a
good
pile
on
the
side
eneas
left
on
yesterday
going
toward
augusta
ga
it
was
suggested
afterwards
that
this
may
have
been
the
man
advertised
for
in
the
by
a
major
tommey
of
louisville
a
few
weeks
ago
the
matter
will
be
brought
to
his
attention
one
reason
for
the
sudden
departure
of
the
old
negro
who
had
become
quite
a
hero
among
members
of
his
race
is
said
to
be
a
movement
to
elect
him
to
the
state
senate
louisville
correspondence
telegraph
and
your
correspondent
on
thursday
last
was
the
favored
guest
of
major
george
tommey
the
famous
commander
of
the
tommey
legion
which
rendered
conspicuous
service
to
the
confederacy
as
part
of
johnston
afterwards
hood
army
in
the
tennessee
and
north
georgia
campaigns
the
major
lives
about
twelve
miles
from
this
place
at
tommeysville
as
his
plantation
is
called
his
delightful
residence
is
one
of
the
houses
with
broad
hall
and
verandahs
and
two
large
wings
and
is
situated
in
a
beautiful
grove
of
oak
and
hickory
the
broad
lawn
in
front
abounds
with
roses
and
among
them
is
a
tiny
fountain
with
a
spray
beyond
the
house
lie
the
barns
and
the
negro
quarters
and
a
small
artificial
lake
where
ducks
abound
army
missed
the
charming
spot
and
the
only
suggestion
of
the
late
unpleasantness
is
the
major
sword
crossed
with
the
colors
of
the
legion
over
the
broad
fireplace
at
the
end
of
the
hall
the
occasion
of
your
correspondent
visit
was
the
marriage
of
the
major
only
daughter
beauregarde
forrest
to
mirabeau
lamar
temple
of
dallas
texas
the
bride
a
petite
brunette
of
great
beauty
entered
life
eighteen
years
ago
inheriting
her
mother
name
but
by
the
act
of
the
georgia
legislature
this
was
changed
in
honor
of
the
two
heroes
of
the
confederacy
dear
to
the
heart
of
her
illustrious
father
the
groom
bears
the
name
of
two
georgia
families
long
ago
transplated
to
the
lone
star
state
and
is
an
attorney
of
great
promise
the
wedding
supper
was
charming
in
its
simplicity
and
homeliness
using
the
word
in
its
original
sense
the
broad
back
porch
between
the
two
wings
was
closed
in
with
smilax
and
the
feast
was
spread
on
a
great
table
twenty
feet
in
diameter
seats
were
placed
for
forty
such
a
display
of
delicacies
and
substantials
has
not
been
seen
in
this
section
since
the
good
old
days
before
the
war
the
low
growing
ferns
and
of
the
decorations
there
by
the
hundreds
did
not
hide
the
guests
smiling
faces
wine
the
famous
scuppernong
of
the
own
vintage
was
the
only
stimulant
visible
for
the
major
and
his
good
lady
are
almost
total
abstainers
when
the
guests
were
seated
a
grace
was
pronounced
by
the
rev
thigpen
and
fun
and
merriment
broke
loose
toast
after
toast
was
given
and
sentiment
and
the
poets
were
interspersed
with
songs
from
the
family
negroes
assembled
in
the
backyard
by
a
gigantic
bonfire
some
of
the
songs
were
of
exquisite
harmony
and
pathos
freedom
so
far
had
brought
but
little
of
brightness
into
the
lives
of
these
humble
people
a
dramatic
situation
that
will
one
day
enter
into
a
story
came
during
the
supper
festivities
a
sudden
excitement
among
the
negroes
was
followed
by
cries
some
of
merriment
and
some
of
fear
and
by
a
stampede
of
the
juniors
in
the
red
light
of
the
bonfire
an
old
negro
suddenly
appeared
reining
up
a
splendid
grey
horse
the
old
man
was
seated
in
a
road
cart
enveloped
in
a
flopping
linen
duster
and
wore
a
silk
hat
his
whoa
chainlightning
resounded
all
over
the
place
then
he
stood
up
and
began
to
shout
about
moses
and
the
hebrew
children
being
led
out
of
egypt
into
the
promised
land
major
tommey
listened
for
a
brief
instant
and
rushed
out
the
newcomer
met
him
with
an
equal
rush
and
their
loud
greetings
floated
back
to
us
clear
as
the
notes
of
a
plantation
bell
eneas
you
black
rascal
where
have
you
been
o
lord
marse
george
glory

eneas
screamed
the
little
bride
gathering
up
her
skirts
and
rushing
out
in
the
strong
light
as
the
wedding
party
hurriedly
followed
we
could
see
the
old
negro
hanging
to
his
master
as
he
filled
the
night
with
his
weird
cries
catching
the
excitement
the
negroes
around
began
to
moan
and
chant
taking
their
text
from
the
old
words
where
have
you
been
sir
the
major
was
trying
to
free
himself
and
choking
with
tears
and
laughter
all
over
de
blessed
worl
marse
george
but
i
home
ergin
you
hyar
me
niggers

stop
sir
but
suddenly
the
old
man
grew
rigid
in
the
grasp
of
a
momentous
thought
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
audible
to
only
a
few
of
us
marse
george
wha
nancy
nancy

dead
eneas
said
the
major
sadly
thank

said
the
old
man
fervently
where
is
my
trunk
eneas
the
old
negro
was
making
a
horn
of
his
hands
and
giving
the
plantation
halloo
with
his
eyes
set
on
the
banking
shadows
beyond
the
fire
he
waited
an
inscrutable
smile
on
his
wrinkled
face
presently
into
the
circle
of
light
came
an
old
grey
mare
drawing
a
wagon
in
which
sat
a
yellow
woman
hovering
a
small
colony
of
children
i
done

eneas
indignantly

wide
open
the
little
colony
fell
over
the
wheels
like
cooters
from
a
log
and
drawing
aside
the
hay
that
had
held
them
eneas
brought
forth
a
time
and
weather
defying

he
heaved
a
mighty
sigh
of

o

somebody
open
the
trunk
major
tommey
picked
up
an
axe
and
with
one
blow
sliced
off
the
ancient
lock
from
its
snug
nest
in
cotton
batting
the
bride
lifted
a
shining
cup
the
cup
editor
advertised
in
your
columns
a
few
weeks
ago
a
bucket
rattled
down
in
the
nearby
well
and
the
came
with
a
great
gourd
to
fill
it
then
he
read
aloud
the
quaint
inscription
ye
bryde

no

the
little
woman
accepted
the
challenge
with
the
cup
and
smiling
up
to
the
face
of
her
husband
sipped
of
the
crystal
draught
and
handed
him
the
cup
he
too
drank
but
the
slight
flush
on
the
bride
face
was
as
nothing
to
the
fiery
scarlet
of
his
own
when
a
storm
of
applause
greeted
the
act
eneas
had
drawn
the
major
aside
and
produced
an
old

stuffed
