mars
habitable
a

preface
this
small
volume
was
commenced
as
a
review
article
on
professor
percival
lowell
book
and
its
with
the
object
of
showing
that
the
large
amount
of
new
and
interesting
facts
contained
in
this
work
did
not
invalidate
the
conclusion
i
had
reached
in
and
stated
in
my
book
on
place
in
the
that
mars
was
not
habitable
but
the
more
complete
presentation
of
the
opposite
view
in
the
volume
now
under
discussion
required
a
more
detailed
examination
of
the
various
physical
problems
involved
and
as
the
subject
is
one
of
great
popular
as
well
as
scientific
interest
i
determined
to
undertake
the
task
this
was
rendered
the
more
necessary
by
the
fact
that
in
july
last
professor
lowell
published
in
the
an
elaborate
mathematical
article
claiming
to
demonstrate
that
notwithstanding
its
much
greater
distance
from
the
sun
and
its
excessively
thin
atmosphere
mars
possessed
a
climate
on
the
average
equal
to
that
of
the
south
of
england
and
in
its
polar
and
regions
even
less
severe
than
that
of
the
earth
such
a
contention
of
course
required
to
be
dealt
with
and
led
me
to
collect
information
bearing
upon
temperature
in
all
its
aspects
and
so
enlarging
my
criticism
that
i
saw
it
would
be
necessary
to
issue
it
in
book
form
two
of
my
mathematical
friends
have
pointed
out
the
chief
omission
which
vitiates
professor
lowell
mathematical
conclusions
that
of
a
failure
to
recognise
the
very
large
conservative
and
effect
of
a
dense
atmosphere
this
very
point
however
i
had
already
myself
discussed
in
chapter
and
by
means
of
some
remarkable
researches
on
the
heat
of
the
moon
and
an
investigation
of
the
causes
of
its
very
low
temperature
i
have
i
think
demonstrated
the
incorrectness
of
lowell
results
in
my
last
chapter
in
which
i
briefly
summarise
the
whole
argument
i
have
further
strengthened
the
case
for
very
severe
cold
in
mars
by
adducing
the
rapid
lowering
of
temperature
universally
caused
by
diminution
of
atmospheric
pressure
as
manifested
in
the
phenomenon
of
temperate
climates
at
moderate
heights
even
close
to
the
equator
cold
climates
at
greater
heights
even
on
extensive
plateaux
culminating
in
arctic
climates
and
perpetual
snow
at
heights
where
the
air
is
still
far
denser
than
it
is
on
the
surface
of
mars
this
argument
itself
is
in
my
opinion
conclusive
but
it
is
enforced
by
two
others
equally
complete
neither
of
which
is
adequately
met
by
lowell
the
careful
examination
which
i
have
been
led
to
give
to
the
whole
of
the
phenomena
which
mars
presents
and
especially
to
the
discoveries
of
lowell
has
led
me
to
what
i
hope
will
be
considered
a
satisfactory
physical
explanation
of
them
this
explanation
which
occupies
the
whole
of
my
seventh
chapter
is
founded
upon
a
special
mode
of
origin
for
mars
derived
from
the
meteoritic
hypothesis
now
very
widely
adopted
by
astronomers
and
physicists
then
by
a
comparison
with
certain
and
widely
spread
geological
phenomena
i
show
how
the
great
features
of
mars
the
and
may
have
been
caused
this
chapter
will
perhaps
be
the
most
interesting
to
the
general
reader
as
furnishing
a
quite
natural
explanation
of
features
of
the
planet
which
have
been
termed
by
lowell
incidentally
also
i
have
been
led
to
an
explanation
of
the
highly
volcanic
nature
of
the
moon
surface
this
seems
to
me
absolutely
to
require
some
such
origin
as
sir
george
darwin
has
given
it
and
thus
furnishes
corroborative
proof
of
the
accuracy
of
the
hypothesis
that
our
moon
has
had
an
unique
origin
among
the
known
satellites
in
having
been
thrown
off
from
the
earth
itself

of
the

of
birmingham

chapter
i
early
observers
of
mars
few
persons
except
astronomers
fully
realise
that
of
all
the
planets
of
the
solar
system
the
only
one
whose
solid
surface
has
been
seen
with
certainty
is
mars
and
very
fortunately
that
is
also
the
only
one
which
is
sufficiently
near
to
us
for
the
physical
features
of
the
surface
to
be
determined
with
any
accuracy
even
if
we
could
see
it
in
the
other
planets
of
venus
we
probably
see
only
the
upper
surface
of
its
cloudy
atmosphere
as
regards
jupiter
and
saturn
this
is
still
more
certain
since
their
low
density
will
only
permit
of
a
comparatively
small
proportion
of
their
huge
bulk
being
solid
their
belts
are
but
the
of
their
upper
atmosphere
perhaps
thousands
of
miles
above
their
solid
surfaces
and
a
somewhat
similar
condition
seems
to
prevail
in
the
far
more
remote
planets
uranus
and
neptune
it
has
thus
happened
that
although
as
telescopic
objects
of
interest
and
beauty
the
marvellous
rings
of
saturn
the
belts
and
aspects
of
the
satellites
of
jupiter
and
the
phases
of
venus
together
with
its
extreme
brilliancy
still
remain
unsurpassed
yet
the
greater
amount
of
details
of
these
features
when
examined
with
the
powerful
instruments
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
neither
added
much
to
our
knowledge
of
the
planets
themselves
or
led
to
any
sensational
theories
calculated
to
attract
the
popular
imagination
footnote
mercury
also
seems
to
have
a
scanty
atmosphere
but
as
its
mass
is
only
that
of
the
earth
it
can
retain
only
the
heavier
gases
and
its
atmosphere
may
be
as
is
that
of
mars
according
to
lowell
its
dusky
markings
as
seen
by
schiaparelli
seem
to
be
permanent
and
they
are
also
for
considerable
periods
unchangeable
in
position
indicating
that
the
planet
keeps
the
same
face
towards
the
sun
as
does
venus
this
was
confirmed
by
lowell
in
its
distance
from
us
and
unfavourable
position
for
observation
must
prevent
us
from
obtaining
any
detailed
knowledge
of
its
actual
surface
though
its
low
reflective
power
indicates
that
the
surface
may
be
really
visible
but
in
the
case
of
mars
the
progress
of
discovery
has
had
a
very
different
result
the
most
obvious
peculiarity
of
this
planet
its
polar
were
seen
about
years
ago
but
they
were
first
proved
to
increase
and
decrease
alternately
in
the
summer
and
winter
of
each
hemisphere
by
sir
william
herschell
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
fact
gave
the
impulse
to
that
idea
of
similarity
in
the
conditions
of
mars
and
the
earth
which
the
recognition
of
many
large
dusky
patches
and
streaks
as
water
and
the
more
ruddy
and
brighter
portions
as
land
further
increased
added
to
this
a
day
only
about
half
an
hour
longer
than
our
own
and
a
succession
of
seasons
of
the
same
character
as
ours
but
of
nearly
double
the
length
owing
to
its
much
longer
year
seemed
to
leave
little
wanting
to
render
this
planet
a
true
earth
on
a
smaller
scale
it
was
therefore
very
natural
to
suppose
that
it
must
be
inhabited
and
that
we
should
some
day
obtain
evidence
of
the
fact
canals
discovered
by
hence
the
great
interest
excited
when
schiaparelli
at
the
milan
observatory
during
the
very
favourable
opposition
of
and
observed
that
the
whole
of
the
tropical
and
temperate
regions
from
to
lat
were
covered
with
a
remarkable
network
of
broader
curved
and
narrower
straight
lines
of
a
dark
colour
at
each
successive
favourable
opposition
these
strange
objects
called
channels
by
their
discoverer
but
rather
misleadingly
in
england
and
america
were
observed
by
means
of
all
the
great
telescopes
in
the
world
and
their
reality
and
general
features
became
well
established
in
schiaparelli
first
map
they
were
represented
as
being
much
broader
and
less
sharply
defined
than
he
himself
and
other
observers
found
by
later
and
equally
favourable
observations
that
they
really
were
of
the
double
in
another
strange
feature
was
discovered
by
schiaparelli
who
found
that
about
twenty
canals
which
had
previously
been
seen
single
were
now
distinctly
double
that
is
that
they
consisted
of
two
parallel
lines
equally
distinct
and
either
very
close
together
or
a
considerable
distance
apart
this
curious
appearance
was
at
first
thought
to
be
due
to
some
instrumental
defect
or
optical
illusion
but
as
it
was
soon
confirmed
by
other
observers
with
the
best
instruments
and
in
widely
different
localities
it
became
in
time
accepted
as
a
real
phenomenon
of
the
planet
surface
spots
discovered
at
the
favourable
opposition
of
pickering
noticed
that
besides
the
of
various
sizes
there
were
numerous
very
small
black
spots
apparently
quite
circular
and
occurring
at
every
intersection
or
of
the
many
of
these
had
been
seen
by
schiaparelli
as
larger
and
dark
patches
and
were
termed
seas
or
lakes
but
pickering
observatory
was
at
arequipa
in
peru
about
feet
above
the
sea
and
with
such
perfect
atmospheric
conditions
as
were
in
his
opinion
equal
to
a
doubling
of
telescopic
aperture
they
were
soon
detected
by
other
observers
especially
by
lowell
in
who
thus
wrote
of
them
scattered
over
the
groundwork
of
the
continental
regions
of
the
planet
are
any
number
of
dark
round
spots
how
many
there
may
be
it
is
not
possible
to
state
as
the
better
the
seeing
the
more
of
them
there
seem
to
be
in
spite
however
of
their
great
number
there
is
no
instance
of
one
unconnected
with
a
canal
what
is
more
there
is
apparently
none
that
does
not
lie
at
the
junction
of
several
canals
reversely
all
the
junctions
appear
to
be
provided
with
spots
plotted
upon
a
globe
they
and
their
connecting
canals
make
a
most
curious
network
over
all
the
equatorial
parts
of
the
planet

mass
of
lines
and
knots
the
one
marking
being
as
omnipresent
as
the
other
of
colour
during
the
oppositions
of
and
it
was
fully
recognised
that
a
regular
course
of
change
occurred
dependent
upon
the
succession
of
the
seasons
as
had
been
first
suggested
by
schiaparelli
as
the
polar
snows
melt
the
adjacent
seas
appear
to
overflow
and
spread
out
as
far
as
the
tropics
and
are
often
seen
to
assume
a
distinctly
green
colour
these
remarkable
changes
and
the
extraordinary
phenomena
of
perfect
straight
lines
crossing
each
other
over
a
large
portion
of
the
planet
surface
with
the
circular
spots
at
their
intersections
had
such
an
appearance
of
artificiality
that
the
idea
that
they
were
really
made
by
intelligent
beings
for
purposes
of
irrigation
was
first
hinted
at
and
then
adopted
as
the
only
intelligible
explanation
by
lowell
and
a
few
other
persons
this
at
once
seized
upon
the
public
imagination
and
was
spread
by
the
newspapers
and
magazines
over
the
whole
civilised
world
of
seas
at
this
time
it
began
to
be
doubted
whether
there
were
any
seas

all
on
mars
professor
pickering
thought
they
were
far
more
limited
in
size
than
had
been
supposed
and
even
might
not
exist
as
true
seas
professor
barnard
with
the
lick
inch
telescope
discerned
an
astonishing
wealth
of
detail
on
the
surface
of
mars
so
intricate
minute
and
abundant
that
it
baffled
all
attempts
to
delineate
it
and
these
peculiarities
were
seen
upon
the
supposed
seas
as
well
as
on
the
in
fact
under
the
best
conditions
these
lost
all

uniformity

appearance

that
of

country
broken
by
ridges
rifts
and
canyons
seen
from
a
great
elevation
as
we
shall
see
later
on
these
doubts
soon
became

and
it
is

almost
universally
admitted

is
that
the
author
has
here
for
the
first
time
fully
set
forth
his
views
both
as
to
the
habitability
of
mars
and
as
to
its
being
actually
inhabited
by
beings
comparable
with
ourselves
in
intellect
the
larger
part
of
the
work
is
in
fact
devoted
to
a
detailed
description
of
what
he
terms
the
features
of
the
planet
surface
including
especially
a
full
account
of
the
single
and
double
the
as
he
terms
the
dark
spots
at
their
intersections
and
the
varying
visibility
of
both
depending
partly
on
the
martian
seasons
while
the
five
concluding
chapters
deal
with
the
possibility
of
animal
life
and
the
evidence
in
favour
of
it
he
also
upholds
the
theory
of
the
canals
having
been
constructed
for
the
purpose
of
the
scanty
that
exists
and
throughout
the
whole
of
this
argument
he
clearly
shows
that
he
considers
the
evidence
to
be
satisfactory
and
that
the
only
intelligible
explanation
of
the
whole
of
the
phenomena
he
so
clearly
sets
forth
is
that
the
inhabitants
of
mars
have
carried
out
on
their
small
and
naturally
inhospitable
planet
a
vast
system
of
far
greater
both
in
its
extent
in
its
utility
and
its
effect
upon
their
world
as
a
habitation
for
civilised
beings
than
anything
we
have
yet
done
upon
our
earth
where
our
destructive
agencies
are
perhaps
more
prominent
than
those
of
an
improving
and
recuperative
character
challenge
to
the
thinking
this
volume
is
therefore
in
the
nature
of
a
challenge
not
so
much
to
astronomers
as
to
the
educated
world
at
large
to
investigate
the
evidence
for
so
portentous
a
conclusion
to
do
this
requires
only
a
general
acquaintance
with
modern
science
more
especially
with
mechanics
and
physics
while
the
main
contention
with
which
i
shall
chiefly
deal
that
the
features
termed
are
really
works
of
art
and
necessitate
the
presence
of
intelligent
organic
beings
requires
only
care
and
judgment
in
drawing
conclusions
from
admitted
facts
as
i
have
already
paid
some
attention
to
this
problem
and
have
expressed
the
opinion
that
mars
is
not
habitable
judging
from
the
evidence
then
available
and
as
few
men
of
science
have
the
leisure
required
for
a
careful
examination
of
so
speculative
a
subject
i
propose
here
to
point
out
what
the
facts
as
stated
by
lowell
himself
do
render
even
probable
much
less
prove
incidentally
i
may
be
able
to
adduce
evidence
of
a
more
or
less
weighty
character
which
seems
to
negative
the
possibility
of
any
high
form
of
animal
life
on
mars
and
the
development
of
such
life
as
might
culminate
in
a
being
equal
or
superior
to
ourselves
as
most
popular
works
on
astronomy
for
the
last
ten
years
at
least
as
well
as
many
scientific
periodicals
and
popular
magazines
have
reproduced
some
of
the
maps
of
mars
by
schiaparelli
lowell
and
others
the
general
appearance
of
its
surface
will
be
familiar
to
most
readers
who
will
thus
be
fully
able
to
appreciate
lowell

of
his
own
further
discoveries
which
i
may
have
to
quote
one
of
the
of
these

lowell
has
been
able
on
various
favourable
occasions
to
detect
a
network
of
straight
lines
meeting
or
crossing
each
other
at
various
angles
and
often
extending
to
a
thousand
or
even
over
two
thousand
miles
in
length
they
are
seen
to
cross
both
the
light
and
the
dark
regions
of
the
planet
surface
often
extending
up
to
or
starting
from
the
polar
most
of
these
lines
are
so
fine
as
only
to
be
visible
on
special
occasions
of
atmospheric
clearness
and
steadiness
which
hardly
ever
occur
at
lowland
stations
even
with
the
best
instruments
and
almost
all
are
seen
to
be
as
perfectly
straight
as
if
drawn
with
a
ruler
double
under
exceptionally
favourable
conditions
many
of
the
lines
that
have
been
already
seen
single
appear
double
a
pair
of
equally
fine
lines
exactly
parallel
throughout
their
whole
length
and
appearing
as
lowell
says
clear
cut
upon
the
disc
its
twin
lines
like
the
rails
of
a
railway
track
both
schiaparelli
and
lowell
were
at
first
so
surprised
at
this
phenomenon
that
they
thought
it
must
be
an
optical
illusion
and
it
was
only
after
many
observations
in
different
years
and
by
the
application
of
every
conceivable
test
that
they
both
became
convinced
that
they
witnessed
a
real
feature
of
the
planet
surface
lowell
says
he
has
now
seen
them
hundreds
of
times
and
that
his
first
view
of
one
was
most
startlingly
impressive
sight
he
has
ever
witnessed
of
the
a
few
dimensions
of
these
strange
objects
must
be
given
in
order
that
readers
may
appreciate
their
full
strangeness
and
inexplicability
out
of
more
than
four
hundred
canals
seen
and
recorded
by
lowell
or
about
one
eighth
are
either
constantly
or
occasionally
seen
to
be
double
the
appearance
of
duplicity
being
more
or
less
periodical
of
generally
lowell
states
that
they
vary
in
length
from
a
few
hundred
to
a
few
thousand
miles
long
one
of
the
largest
being
the
phison
which
he
terms
typical
double
canal
and
which
is
said
to
be
miles
long
while
the
distance
between
its
two
constituents
is
about
miles
the
actual
width
of
each
canal
is
from
a
minimum
of
about
a
mile
up
to
several
miles
in
one
case
over
twenty
a
great
feature
of
the
doubles
is
that
they
are
strictly
parallel
throughout
their
whole
course
and
that
in
almost
all
cases
they
are
so
truly
straight
as
to
form
parts
of
a
great
circle
of
the
planet
sphere
a
few
however
follow
a
gradual
but
very
distinct
curve
and
such
of
these
as
are
double
present
the
same
strict
parallelism
as
those
which
are
straight

across

it
was
only
after
seventeen
years
of
observation
of
the
canals
that
it
was
found
that
they
extended
also
into
and
across
the
dark
spots
and
surfaces
which
by
the
earlier
observers
were
termed
seas
and
which
then
formed
the
only
clearly
distinguishable
and
permanent
marks
on
the
planet
surface
at
the
present
time
professor
lowell
states
that
this
curious
triangulation
has
been
traced
over
almost
every
portion
of
the
planet
surface
whether
dark
or
light
whether
greenish
ochre
or
brown
in
colour
in
some
parts
they
are
much
closer
together
than
in
others
forming
a
perfect
network
of
lines
and
spots
so
that
to
identify
them
all
was
a
matter
of
extreme
difficulty
two
such
portions
are
figured
at
pages
and
of
lowell
volume
the
curious
circular
black
spots
which
are
seen
at
the
intersections
of
many
of
the
canals
and
which
in
some
parts
of
the
surface
are
very
numerous
are
said
to
be
more
difficult
of
detection
than
even
the
lines
being
often
blurred
or
rendered
completely
invisible
by
slight
irregularities
in
our
own
atmosphere
while
the
canals
themselves
continue
visible
about
of
these
have
now
been
found
and
the
more
prominent
of
them
are
estimated
to
vary
from
to
miles
in
diameter
there
are
however
many
much
smaller
down
to
minute
and
barely
visible
black
points
yet
they
all
seem
a
little
larger
than
the
canals
which
enter
them
where
the
canals
are
double
the
spots
or
as
lowell
terms
them
lie
between
the
two
parallel
canals
no
one
can
read
this
book
without
admiration
for
the
extreme
perseverance
in
long
continued
and
successful
observation
the
results
of
which
are
here
recorded
and
i
myself
accept
unreservedly
the
substantial
accuracy
of
the
whole
series
it
must
however
always
be
remembered
that
the
growth
of
knowledge
of
the
detailed
markings
has
been
very
gradual
and
that
much
of
it
has
only
been
seen
under
very
rare
and
exceptional
conditions
it
is
therefore
quite
possible
that
if
at
some
future
time
a
further
considerable
advance
in
instrumental
power
should
be
made
or
a
still
more
favourable
locality
be
found
the
new
discoveries
might
so
modify
present
appearances
as
to
render
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
them
more
easy
than
it
is
at
present
but
though
i
wish
to
do
the
fullest
justice
to
lowell
technical
skill
and
long
years
of
persevering
work
which
have
brought
to
light
the
most
complex
and
remarkable
appearances
that
any
of
the
heavenly
bodies
present
to
us
i
am
obliged
absolutely
to
part
company
with
him
as
regards
the
startling
theory
of
artificial
production
which
he
thinks
alone
adequate
to
explain
them
so
much
is
this
the
case
that
the
very
phenomena
which
to
him
seem
to
demonstrate
the
intervention
of
intelligent
beings
working
for
the
improvement
of
their
own
environment
are
those
which
seem
to
me
to
bear
the
unmistakable
impress
of
being
due
to
natural
forces
while
they
are
wholly
unintelligible
as
being
useful
works
of
art
i
refer
of
course
to
the
great
system
of
what
are
termed
whether
single
or
double
of
these
i
shall
give
my
own
interpretation
later
on
chapter
iii
the
climate
and
physiography
of
mars
lowell
admits
and
indeed
urges
strongly
that
there
are
no
permanent
bodies
of
water
on
mars
that
the
dark
spaces
and
spots
thought
by
the
early
observers
to
be
seas
are
certainly
not
so
now
though
they
may
have
been
at
an
earlier
period
that
true
clouds
are
rare
even
if
they
exist
the
appearances
that
have
been
taken
for
them
being
either
or
a
surface
haze
that
there
is
consequently
no
rain
and
that
large
portions
about
of
the
surface
have
all
the
characteristics
of
desert
regions
the
only
source
of
this
state
of
things
is
supposed
to
be
ameliorated
by
the
fact
of
the
polar
snows
which
in
the
winter
cover
the
arctic
and
about
half
the
temperate
regions
of
each
hemisphere
alternately
the
maximum
of
the
northern
is
reached
at
a
period
of
the
martian
winter
corresponding
to
the
end
of
february
with
us
about
the
end
of
march
the
cap
begins
to
shrink
in
size
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
this
goes
on
so
rapidly
that
early
in
the
june
of
mars
it
is
reduced
to
its
minimum
about
the
same
time
changes
of
colour
take
place
in
the
adjacent
darker
portions
of
the
surface
which
become
at
first
bluish
and
later
a
decided
but
by
far
the
larger
portion
including
almost
all
the
equatorial
regions
of
the
planet
remain
always
of
a
tint
footnote
in
at
mount
wilson
california
photographs
of
mars
on
april
showed
the
southern
polar
cap
of
moderate
dimensions
but
with
a
large
dim
adjacent
area
hours
later
a
corresponding
plate
showed
this
same
area
brilliantly
white
the
result
apparently
of
a
great
martian
snowfall
in
the
same
observer
witnessed
the
steady
disappearance
of
square
miles
of
the
southern
an
area
nearly
of
that
hemisphere
of
the
planet
the
rapid
and
comparatively
early
disappearance
of
the
white
covering
is
very
reasonably
supposed
to
prove
that
it
is
of
small
thickness
corresponding
perhaps
to
about
a
foot
or
two
of
snow
in
america
and
europe
and
that
by
the
increasing
amount
of
it
is
converted
partly
into
liquid
and
partly
into
vapour
coincident
with
this
disappearance
and
as
a
presumed
result
of
the
water
or
other
liquid
producing
inundations
the
tinge
which
appears
on
the
previously
dark
portion
of
the
surface
is
supposed
to
be
due
to
a
rapid
growth
of
vegetation
but
the
evidence
on
this
point
does
not
seem
to
be
clear
or
harmonious
for
in
the
four
coloured
plates
showing
the
planet
surface
at
successive
martian
dates
from
december
to
february
not
only
is
a
considerable
extent
of
the
south
temperate
zone
shown
to
change
rapidly
from
to
and
then
again
to
but
the
portions
furthest
from
the
supposed
fertilising
overflow
are
permanently
green
as
are
also
considerable
portions
in
the
opposite
or
northern
hemisphere
which
one
would
think
would
then
be
completely
dried
up
hills
upon
the
special
point
to
which
i
here
wish
to
call
attention
is
this
lowell
main
contention
is
that
the
surface
of
mars
is
wonderfully
smooth
and
level
not
only
are
there
no
mountains
but
there
are
no
hills
or
valleys
or
plateaux
this
assumption
is
absolutely
essential
to
support
the
other
great
assumption
that
the
wonderful
network
of
perfectly
straight
lines
over
nearly
the
whole
surface
of
the
planet
are
irrigation
canals
it
is
not
alleged
that
irregularities
or
undulations
of
a
few
hundreds
or
even
one
or
two
thousands
of
feet
could
possibly
be
detected
while
certainly
all
we
know
of
planetary
formation
or
structure
point
strongly
towards
inequalities
of
surface
lowell
admits
that
the
dark
portions
of
the
surface
when
examined
on
the
terminator
the
margin
of
the
illuminated
portion
do
like
hollows
and
the
beds
of
seas
yet
the
supposed
canals
run
across
these
old
in
perfect
straight
lines
just
as
they
do
across
the
many
thousand
miles
of
what
are
admitted
to
be
deserts
which
he
describes
in
these
forcible
terms
pitiless
as
our
deserts
are
they
are
but
faint
forecasts
of
the
state
of
things
existent
on
mars
at
the
present
time
it
appears
then
that
lowell
has
to
face
this
dilemma
if
the
whole
surface
of
mars
is
an
almost
perfect
level
could
the
enormous
network
of
straight
canals
each
from
hundreds
to
thousands
of
miles
long
have
been
possibly
constructed
by
intelligent
beings
for
purposes
of
irrigation
but
if
a
complete
and
universal
level
surface
exists
no
such
system
would
be
for
on
a
level
surface
or
on
a
surface
slightly
inclined
from
the
poles
towards
the
equator
which
would
be
advantageous
in
either
case
the
melting
water
would
of
itself
spread
over
the
ground
and
naturally
irrigate
as
much
of
the
surface
as
it
was
possible
for
it
to
reach
if
the
surface
were
not
level
but
consisted
of
slight
elevations
and
expressions
to
the
extent
of
a
few
scores
or
a
few
hundreds
of
feet
then
there
would
be
no
possible
advantage
in
cutting
straight
troughs
through
these
elevations
in
various
directions
with
water
flowing
at
the
bottom
of
them
in
neither
case
and
in
hardly
any
conceivable
case
could
these
perfectly
straight
canals
cutting
across
each
other
in
every
direction
and
at
very
varying
angles
be
of
any
use
or
be
the
work
of
an
intelligent
race
if
any
such
race
could
possibly
have
been
developed
under
the
adverse
conditions
which
exist
in
mars
scanty
but
further
if
there
were
any
superfluity
of
water
derived
from
the
melting
snow
beyond
what
was
sufficient
to
moisten
the
hollows
indicated
by
the
darker
portions
of
the
surface
which
at
the
time
the
water
reaches
them
acquire
a
green
tint
a
superfluity
under
the
circumstances
highly
improbable
that
superfluity
could
be
best
utilised
by
widening
however
little
the
borders
to
which
natural
overflow
had
carried
it
any
attempt
to
make
that
scanty
surplus
by
means
of
overflowing
canals
travel
across
the
equator
into
the
opposite
hemisphere
through
such
a
terrible
desert
region
and
exposed
to
such
a
cloudless
sky
as
lowell
describes
would
be
the
work
of
a
body
of
madmen
rather
than
of
intelligent
beings
it
may
be
safely
asserted
that
not
one
drop
of
water
would
escape
evaporation
or
insoak
at
even
a
hundred
miles
from
its
source
footnote
what
the
evaporation
is
likely
to
be
in
mars
may
be
estimated
by
the
fact
stated
by
professor
gregory
in
his
recent
volume
on
in
that
in
victoria
evaporation
is
at
the
rate
of
ten
feet
per
annum
while
in
central
australia
it
is
very
much
more
the
greatly
diminished
atmospheric
pressure
in
mars
will
probably
more
than
balance
the
loss
of
in
producing
rapid
evaporation

we

so
shrewd
a
people
as
the
irrigators

wasting
labour
and
the

after
so
unprofitable
a
fashion
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
martian
are
quite
flimsy
structures
their
material
might
be
called
snow
since
owing
to
the
small
power
of
gravity
on
mars
snow
is
almost
three
times
lighter
there
than
here
consequently
its
own
weight
can
have
very
little
effect
in
rendering
it
compact
nor
indeed
is
there
time
for
much
settling
down
the
calotte
does
not
form
until
several
months
after
the
winter
solstice
and
it
begins
to
melt
as
a
rule
shortly
after
the
vernal
equinox
the
interval
between
these
two
epochs
in
the
southern
hemisphere
of
mars
is
days
the
snow
lies
on
the
ground
at
the
outside
a
couple
of
months
at
times
it
melts
while
it
is
still
fresh
fallen
thus
at
the
opposition
of
the
spreading
of
the
northern
snows
was
delayed
until
seven
weeks
after
the
equinox
and
they
had
accordingly
no
sooner
reached
their
maximum
than
they
began
to
decline

areas
on
mars
so
named
no
attempt
has
yet
been
made
to
estimate
the
quantity
of
water
derivable
from
the
melting
of
one
of
these
formations
yet
the
experiment
is
worth
trying
as
a
help
towards
defining
ideas
let
us
grant
that
the
average
depth
of
snow
in
them
of
the
delicate
martian
kind
is
twenty
feet
equivalent
at
the
most
to
one
foot
of
water
the
maximum
area
covered
of
square
miles
is
nearly
equal
to
that
of
the
united
states
while
the
whole
globe
of
mars
measures
square
miles
of
which
on
the
present
hypothesis
is
under
cultivation
and
in
need
of
water
nearly
the
whole
of
the
dark
areas
as
we
know
are
situated
in
the
southern
hemisphere
of
which
they
extend
over
at
the
very
least
square
miles
that
is
to
say
they
cover
an
area
in
round
numbers
seven
times
that
of
the
only
of
a
foot
of
water
accordingly
could
possibly
be
made
available
for
their
fertilisation
supposing
them
to
get
the
entire
advantage
of
the
spring
freshet
upon
a
stint
of
less
than
two
inches
of
water
these
fertile
lands
are
expected
to
flourish
and
bear
abundant
crops
and
since
they
completely
enclose
the
polar
area
they
are
necessarily
served
first
the
great
emissaries
for
carrying
off
the
surplus
of
their
aqueous
riches
would
then
appear
to
be
superfluous
constructions
nor
is
it
likely
that
the
share
in
those
riches
due
to
the
canals
and
oases
intricately
dividing
up
the
wide
dry
continental
plains
can
ever
be
realised
we
have
assumed
in
our
little
calculation
that
the
entire
contents
of
a
polar
hood
turn
to
water
but
in
actual
fact
a
considerable
proportion
of
them
must
pass
directly
into
vapour
omitting
the
intermediate
stage
even
with
us
a
large
quantity
of
snow
is
removed
aerially
and
in
the
rare
atmosphere
of
mars
this
cause
of
waste
must
be
especially
effective
thus
the
polar
reservoirs
are
despoiled
in
the
act
of
being
opened
further
objections
might
be
taken
to
lowell
irrigation
scheme
but
enough
has
been
said
to
show
that
it
is
hopelessly
unworkable
it
will
be
seen
that
the
writer
of
this
article
accepted
the
existence
of
water
on
mars
on
the
testimony
of
sir
huggins
which
in
view
of
later
observations
he
has
himself
acknowledged
to
be
valueless
johnstone
stoney
proof
of
its
absence
derived
from
the
molecular
theory
of
gases
had
not
then
been
made
public
of
some
of
the
at
the
end
of
his
volume
lowell
gives
a
large
chart
of
mars
on
mercator
projection
showing
the
canals
and
other
features
seen
during
the
opposition
of
this
contains
many
canals
not
shown
on
the
map
here
reproduced
see
frontispiece
and
some
of
the
differences
between
the
two
are
very
puzzling
looking
at
our
map
which
shows
the
snow
below
so
that
the
south
pole
is
out
of
the
view
at
the
top
of
the
map
the
central
feature
is
the
large
spot
ascraeeus
lucus
from
which
ten
canals
diverge
centrally
and
four
from
the
sides
forming
wide
double
canals
fourteen
in
all
there
is
also
a
canal
named
ulysses
which
here
passes
far
to
the
right
of
the
spot
but
in
the
large
chart
enters
it
centrally
looking
at
our
map
we
see
going
downwards
a
little
to
the
left
the
canal
udon
which
runs
through
a
dark
area
quite
to
the
outer
margin
in
the
dark
area
however
there
is
shown
on
the
chart
a
spot
aspledon
lucus
where
five
canals
meet
and
if
this
is
taken
as
a
terminus
the
udon
canal
is
almost
exactly
miles
long
and
another
on
its
right
lapadon
is
the
same
length
while
ich
running
in
a
slightly
curved
line
to
a
large
spot
lucus
castorius
on
the
chart
is
still
longer
the
ulysses
canal
which
on
the
chart
runs
straight
from
the
point
of
the
mare
sirenum
to
the
astraeeus
lucus
is
about
miles
long
others
however
are
even
longer
and
lowell
says
with
them
miles
is
common
while
many
exceed
and
the
is
miles
from
the
point
where
it
leaves
lucus
phoeniceus
to
where
it
enters
the
trivium
charontis
this
last
canal
is
barely
visible
on
our
map
its
commencement
being
indicated
by
the
word
eumenides
the
trivium
charontis
is
situated
just
beyond
the
margin
of
our
map
it
is
a
triangular
dark
area
the
sides
about
miles
long
and
it
is
shown
on
the
chart
as
being
the
centre
from
which
radiate
thirteen
canals
another
centre
is
aquae
calidae
situated
at
the
point
of
a
dark
area
running
obliquely
from
to
latitude
and
as
shown
on
a
map
of
the
opposite
hemisphere
to
our
map
has
nearly
twenty
canals
radiating
from
it
in
almost
every
direction
here
at
all
events
there
seems
to
be
no
special
connection
with
the
polar
and
the
radiating
lines
seem
to
have
no
intelligent
purpose
whatever
but
are
such
as
might
result
from
fractures
in
a
glass
globe
produced
by
firing
at
it
with
very
small
shots
one
at
a
time
taking
the
whole
series
of
them
lowell
very
justly
compares
them
to
a
network
which
triangulates
the
surface
of
the
planet
like
a
geodetic
survey
into
polygons
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
at
the
very
lowest
estimate
the
total
length
of
the
canals
observed
and
mapped
by
lowell
must
be
over
a
hundred
thousand
miles
while
he
assures
us
that
numbers
of
others
have
been
seen
over
the
whole
surface
but
so
faintly
or
on
such
rare
occasions
as
to
elude
all
attempts
to
fix
their
position
with
certainty
but
these
being
of
the
same
character
and
evidently
forming
part
of
the
same
system
must
also
be
artificial
and
thus
we
are
led
to
a
system
of
irrigation
of
almost
unimaginable
magnitude
on
a
planet
which
has
no
mountains
no
rivers
and
no
rain
to
support
it
whose
whole
is
derived
from
polar
snows
the
amount
of
which
is
ludicrously
inadequate
to
need
any
such
system
while
the
low
atmospheric
pressure
would
lead
to
rapid
evaporation
thus
greatly
diminishing
the
small
amount
of
moisture
that
is
available
everyone
must
i
think
agree
with
miss
clerke
that
even
admitting
the
assumption
that
the
polar
snows
consist
of
frozen
water
the
excessively
scanty
amount
of
water
thus
obtained
would
render
any
scheme
of
distribution
of
it
hopelessly
unworkable
the
very
remarkable
phenomena
of
the
duplication
of
many
of
the
lines
together
with
the
darkspots
the
oases
at
their
intersections
are
doubtless
all
connected
in
some
unknown
way
with
the
constitution
and
past
history
of
the
planet
but
on
the
theory
of
the
whole
being
works
of
art
they
certainly
do
help
to
remove
any
of
the
difficulties
which
have
been
shown
to
attend
the
theory
that
the
single
lines
represent
artificial
canals
of
irrigation
with
a
strip
of
verdure
on
each
side
of
them
produced
by
their
overflow
on
the
purpose
of
the
before
leaving
this
subject
it
will
be
well
to
quote
lowell
own
words
as
to
the
supposed
perfectly
level
surface
of
mars
and
his
interpretation
of
the
origin
and
purpose
of
the
a
body
of
planetary
size
if
unrotating
becomes
a
sphere
except
for
solar
tidal
deformation
if
rotating
it
takes
on
a
spheroidal
form
exactly
expressive
so
far
as
observation
goes
of
the
centrifugal
force
at
work
mars
presents
such
a
figure
being
flattened
out
to
correspond
to
its
axial
rotation
its
surface
therefore
is
in
fluid
equilibrium
or
in
other
words
a
particle
of
liquid
at
any
point
of
its
surface
at
the
present
time
would
stay
where
it
was
devoid
of
inclination
to
move
elsewhere
now
the
water
which
quickens
the
verdure
of
the
canals
moves
from
the
pole
down
to
the
equator
as
the
season
advances
this
it
does
then
irrespective
of
gravity
no
natural
force
propels
it
and
the
inference
is
forthright
and
inevitable
that
it
is
artificially
helped
to
its
end
there
seems
to
be
no
escape
from
this
deduction
water
only
flows
downhill
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
downhill
on
a
surface
already
in
fluid
equilibrium
a
few
canals
might
presumably
be
so
situated
that
their
flow
could
by
inequality
of
terrane
lie
equatorward
but
not
all
it
is
not
in
particular
but
by
general
consent
that
the
of
mars
develops
from
pole
to
equator
from
the
respective
times
at
which
the
minima
take
place
it
appears
that
the
canal
quickening
occupies
days
as
evidenced
by
the
successive
vegetal
darkenings
to
descend
from
latitude
north
to
latitude
a
journey
of
miles
this
gives
for
the
water
a
speed
of
miles
a
day
or
miles
an
hour
the
rate
of
progression
is
remarkably
uniform
and
this
abets
the
deduction
as
to
assisted
transference
but
the
fact
is
more
unnatural
yet
the
growth
pays
no
regard
to
the
equator
but
proceeds
across
it
as
if
it
did
not
exist
into
the
planet
other
hemisphere
here
is
something
still
more
telling
than
travel
to
this
point
for
even
if
we
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
natural
forces
took
the
water
down
to
the
equator
their
action
must
there
be
certainly
reversed
and
the
equator
prove
a
to
pass
which
were
impossible
pp
i
think
my
readers
will
agree
with
me
that
this
whole
argument
is
one
of
the
most
curious
ever
put
forth
seriously
by
an
eminent
man
of
science
because
the
polar
compression
of
mars
is
about
what
calculation
shows
it
ought
to
be
in
accordance
with
its
rate
of
rotation
its
surface
is
in
a
state
of
equilibrium
and
must
therefore
be
absolutely
level
throughout
but
the
polar
compression
of
the
earth
equally
agrees
with
calculation
therefore
its
surface
is
also
in
equilibrium
therefore
it
also
ought
to
be
as
perfectly
level
on
land
as
it
is
on
the
ocean
surface
but
as
we
know
this
is
very
far
from
being
the
case
why
must
it
be
so
in
mars
are
we
to
suppose
mars
to
have
been
formed
in
some
totally
different
way
from
other
planets
and
that
there
neither
is
nor
ever
has
been
any
reaction
between
its
interior
and
exterior
forces
again
the
assumption
of
perfect
flatness
is
directly
opposed
to
all
observation
and
all
analogy
with
what
we
see
on
the
earth
and
moon
it
gives
no
account
whatever
of
the
numerous
and
large
dark
patches
once
termed
seas
but
now
found
to
be
not
so
and
to
be
full
of
detailed
markings
and
varied
depths
of
shadow
to
suppose
that
these
are
all
the
same
as
the
portions
are
assumed
to
be
implies
that
the
darkness
is
one
of
material
and
colour
only
not
of
diversified
contour
which
again
is
contrary
to
experience
since
difference
of
material
with
us
always
leads
to
differences
in
rate
of
degradation
and
hence
of
diversified
contour
as
these
dark
spaces
actually
show
themselves
under
favourable
conditions
to
independent
observers
on
the
system
of
canals
as
a
we
will
now
see
what
lowell
claims
to
be
the
plain
teaching
of
the
as
a
whole
but
last
and
in
its
import
is
the
system
which
the
canals
form
instead
of
running
at
the
canals
are
interconnected
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
they
seek
centres
instead
of
avoiding
them
the
centres
are
linked
thus
perfectly
one
with
another
an
arrangement
which
could
not
result
from
centres
whether
of
explosion
or
otherwise
which
were
themselves
discrete
furthermore
the
system
covers
the
whole
surface
of
the
planet
dark
areas
and
light
ones
alike
a
distribution
which
exceeds
the
bounds
of
natural
possibility
any
force
which
could
act
longitudinally
on
such
a
scale
must
be
limited
latitudinally
in
its
action
as
witness
the
belts
of
jupiter
and
the
spots
upon
the
sun
rotational
climatic
or
other
physical
cause
could
not
fail
of
zonal
expression
yet
these
lines
are
grandly
indifferent
to
such
competing
influences
finally
the
system
after
meshing
the
surface
in
its
entirety
runs
straight
into
the
polar
caps
it
is
then
a
system
whose
end
and
aim
is
the
tapping
of
the
for
the
water
there
let
loose
then
to
distribute
it
over
the
planet
face
here
again
we
have
curiously
weak
arguments
adduced
to
support
the
view
that
these
numerous
straight
lines
imply
works
of
art
rather
than
of
nature
especially
in
the
comparison
made
with
the
belts
of
jupiter
and
the
spots
on
the
sun
both
purely
atmospheric
phenomena
whereas
the
lines
on
mars
are
on
the
solid
surface
of
the
planet
why
should
there
be
any
resemblance
between
them
every
fact
stated
in
the
above
quotation
always
keeping
in
mind
the
physical
conditions
of
the
planet
its
very
tenuous
atmosphere
and
rainless
seem
wholly
in
favour
of
a
purely
natural
as
opposed
to
an
artificial
origin
and
at
the
close
of
this
discussion
i
shall
suggest
one
which
seems
to
me
to
be
at
least
possible
and
to
explain
the
whole
series
of
the
phenomena
set
forth
and
largely
discovered
by
lowell
in
a
simpler
and
more
probable
manner
than
does
his
tremendous
assumption
of
their
being
works
of
art
readers
who
may
not
possess
lowell
volume
will
find
three
of
his
most
recent
maps
of
the
reproduced
in
of
october
chapter
iv
is
animal
life
possible
on
mars
having
now
shown
that
even
admitting
the
accuracy
of
all
observations
and
provisionally
accepting
all
his
chief
conclusions
as
to
the
climate
the
nature
of
the
the
vegetation
and
the
animal
life
of
mars
yet
his
interpretation
of
the
lines
on
its
surface
as
being
veritably
constructed
by
intelligent
beings
for
the
special
purpose
of
carrying
water
to
the
more
arid
regions
is
wholly
erroneous
and
rationally
inconceivable
i
now
proceed
to
discuss
his
more
fundamental
position
as
to
the
actual
habitability
of
mars
by
a
highly
organised
and
intellectual
race
of
material
organic
beings
and
air
essential
to
here
fortunately
the
issue
is
rendered
very
simple
because
lowell
fully
recognises
the
identity
of
the
constitution
of
matter
and
of
physical
laws
throughout
the
and
that
for
any
high
form
of
organic
life
certain
conditions
which
are
absolutely
essential
on
our
earth
must
also
exist
in
mars
he
admits
for
example
that
water
is
essential
that
an
atmosphere
containing
oxygen
nitrogen
aqueous
vapour
and
carbonic
acid
gas
is
essential
and
that
an
abundant
vegetation
is
essential
and
these
of
course
involve
a
through
a
considerable
portion
of
the
year
that
renders
the
existence
of
these
especially
of
water
possible
and
available
for
the
purposes
of
a
high
and
abundant
animal
life
colour
the
only
evidence
of
in
attempting
to
show
that
these
essentials
actually
exist
on
mars
he
is
not
very
successful
he
adduces
evidence
of
an
atmosphere
but
of
an
exceedingly
scanty
one
since
the
greatest
amount
he
can
give
to
it
is
not
more
than
about
four
inches
of
barometric
pressure
as
we
reckon
it
and
he
assumes
as
he
has
a
fair
right
to
do
till
disproved
that
it
consists
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
with
and
in
approximately
the
same
proportions
as
with
us
with
regard
to
the
last
item
the
there
are
however
many
serious
difficulties
the
of
our
atmosphere
is
derived
from
the
enormous
area
of
our
seas
oceans
lakes
and
rivers
as
well
as
from
the
evaporation
from
heated
lands
and
tropical
forests
of
much
of
the
moisture
produced
by
frequent
and
abundant
rains
all
these
sources
of
supply
are
admittedly
absent
from
mars
which
has
no
permanent
bodies
of
water
no
rain
and
tropical
regions
which
are
almost
entirely
desert
many
writers
have
therefore
doubted
the
existence
of
water
in
any
form
upon
this
planet
supposing
that
the
are
not
formed
of
frozen
water
but
of
or
some
other
heavy
gas
in
a
frozen
state
and
lowell
evidently
feels
this
to
be
a
difficulty
since
the
only
fact
he
is
able
to
adduce
in
favour
of
the
melting
snows
of
the
polar
caps
producing
water
is
that
at
the
time
they
are
melting
a
marginal
blue
band
appears
which
accompanies
them
in
their
retreat
and
this
blue
colour
is
said
to
prove
conclusively
that
the
liquid
is
not
carbonic
acid
but
water
this
point
he
dwells
upon
repeatedly
stating
of
these
blue
borders
this
excludes
the
possibility
of
their
being
formed
by
and
shows
that
of
all
the
substances
we
know
the
material
composing
them
must
be
water
footnote
in
a
paper
written
since
the
book
appeared
the
density
of
air
at
the
surface
of
mars
is
said
to
be
of
the
earth
this
is
the
only
proof
of
the
existence
of
he
adduces
and
it
is
certainly
a
most
extraordinary
and
futile
one
for
it
is
perfectly
well
known
that
although
water
in
large
masses
and
by
transmitted
light
is
of
a
blue
colour
yet
shallow
water
by
reflected
light
is
not
so
and
in
the
case
of
the
liquid
produced
by
the
of
mars
which
the
whole
conditions
of
the
planet
show
must
be
shallow
and
also
be
more
or
less
turbid
it
can
not
possibly
be
the
cause
of
the
blue
tint
said
to
result
from
the
melting
of
the
snow
but
there
is
a
very
weighty
argument
depending
on
the
molecular
theory
of
gases
against
the
polar
caps
of
mars
being
composed
of
frozen
water
at
all
the
mass
and
elastic
force
of
the
several
gases
is
due
to
the
greater
or
less
rapidity
of
the
vibratory
motion
of
their
molecules
under
identical
conditions
the
speed
of
these
molecular
motions
has
been
ascertained
for
all
the
chief
gases
and
it
is
found
to
be
so
great
as
in
certain
cases
to
enable
them
to
overcome
the
force
of
gravity
and
escape
from
a
planet
surface
into
space
johnstone
stoney
has
specially
investigated
this
subject
and
he
finds
that
the
force
of
gravity
on
the
earth
is
sufficient
to
retain
all
the
gases
composing
its
atmosphere
but
not
sufficient
to
retain
hydrogen
and
as
a
consequence
although
this
gas
is
produced
in
small
quantities
by
volcanoes
and
by
decomposing
vegetation
yet
no
trace
of
it
is
found
in
our
atmosphere
the
moon
however
having
only
the
mass
of
the
earth
can
not
retain
any
gas
hence
its
airless
and
waterless
condition
vapour
can
not
exist
on
now
stoney
finds
that
in
order
to
retain
water
vapour
permanently
a
planet
must
have
a
mass
at
least
a
quarter
that
of
the
earth
but
the
mass
of
mars
is
only
that
of
the
earth
therefore
unless
there
are
some
special
conditions
that
prevent
its
loss
this
gas
can
not
be
present
in
the
atmosphere
lowell
does
not
refer
to
this
argument
against
his
view
neither
does
he
claim
the
evidence
of
spectroscopy
in
his
favour
this
was
alleged
more
than
thirty
years
ago
to
show
the
existence
of
in
the
atmosphere
of
mars
but
of
late
years
it
has
been
doubted
and
lowell
complete
silence
on
the
subject
while
laying
stress
on
such
a
very
weak
and
inconclusive
argument
as
that
from
the
tinge
of
colour
that
is
observed
a
little
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
diminishing
shows
that
he
himself
does
not
think
the
fact
to
be
thus
proved
if
he
did
he
would
hardly
adduce
such
an
argument
for
its
presence
as
the
following
the
melting
of
the
caps
on
the
one
hand
and
their
on
the
other
affirm
the
presence
of
in
the
martian
atmosphere
of
whatever
else
that
air
consists
yet
absolutely
the
only
proof
he
gives
that
the
caps
are
frozen
water
is
the
almost
frivolous
above
referred
to
spectroscopic
evidence
of
water
as
sir
william
huggins
is
the
chief
authority
quoted
for
this
fact
and
is
referred
to
as
being
almost
conclusive
in
the
third
edition
of
miss
clerke
of
in
i
have
ascertained
that
his
opinion
at
the
present
time
is
that
there
is
no
conclusive
proof
of
the
presence
of
aqueous
vapour
in
the
atmosphere
of
mars
and
that
observations
at
the
lick
observatory
in
where
the
conditions
and
instruments
are
of
the
highest
order
were
negative
he
also
informs
me
that
marchand
at
the
pic
du
midi
observatory
was
unable
to
obtain
lines
of
aqueous
vapour
in
the
spectrum
of
mars
and
that
in
slipher
at
lowell
observatory
was
unable
to
detect
any
indications
of
aqueous
vapour
in
the
spectrum
of
mars
it
thus
appears
that
spectroscopic
observations
are
quite
accordant
with
the
calculations
founded
on
the
molecular
theory
of
gases
as
to
the
absence
of
aqueous
vapour
and
therefore
presumably
of
liquid
water
from
mars
it
is
true
that
the
spectroscopic
argument
is
purely
negative
and
this
may
be
due
to
the
extreme
delicacy
of
the
observations
required
but
that
dependent
on
the
inability
of
the
force
of
gravity
to
retain
it
is
positive
scientific
evidence
against
its
presence
and
till
shown
to
be
erroneous
must
be
held
to
be
conclusive
this
absence
of
water
is
of
itself
conclusive
against
the
existence
of
animal
life
unless
we
enter
the
regions
of
pure
conjecture
as
to
the
possibility
of
some
other
liquid
being
able
to
take
its
place
and
that
liquid
being
as
omnipresent
there
as
water
is
here
lowell
however
never
takes
this
ground
but
bases
his
whole
theory
on
the
fundamental
identity
of
the
substance
of
the
bodies
of
living
organisms
wherever
they
may
exist
in
the
solar
system
in
the
next
two
chapters
i
shall
discuss
an
equally
essential
condition
that
of
temperature
which
affords
a
still
more
conclusive
and
even
crushing
argument
against
the
suitability
of
mars
for
the
existence
of
organic
life
chapter
the
temperature
of
mars
lowell
estimate
we
have
now
to
consider
a
still
more
important
and
fundamental
question
and
one
which
lowell
does
not
grapple
with
in
this
volume
the
actual
temperatures
on
mars
due
to
its
distance
from
the
sun
and
the
atmospheric
conditions
on
which
he
himself
lays
so
much
stress
if
i
am
not
greatly
mistaken
we
shall
arrive
at
conclusions
on
this
subject
which
are
absolutely
fatal
to
the
conception
of
any
high
form
of
organic
life
being
possible
on
this
planet
problem
of
terrestrial
in
order
that
the
problem
may
be
understood
and
its
importance
appreciated
it
is
necessary
to
explain
the
now
generally
accepted
principles
as
to
the
causes
which
determine
the
temperatures
on
our
earth
and
presumably
on
all
other
planets
whose
conditions
are
not
wholly
unlike
ours
the
fact
of
the
internal
heat
of
the
earth
which
becomes
very
perceptible
even
at
the
moderate
depths
reached
in
mines
and
deep
borings
and
in
the
deepest
mines
becomes
a
positive
inconvenience
leads
many
people
to
suppose
that
the
temperatures
of
the
earth
are
partly
due
to
this
cause
but
it
is
now
generally
admitted
that
this
is
not
the
case
the
reason
being
that
all
rocks
and
soils
in
their
natural
compacted
state
are
exceedingly
bad
conductors
of
heat
a
striking
illustration
of
this
is
the
fact
that
a
stream
of
lava
often
continues
to
be
red
hot
at
a
few
feet
depth
for
years
after
the
surface
is
consolidated
and
is
hardly
any
warmer
than
that
of
the
surrounding
land
a
still
more
remarkable
case
is
that
of
a
glacier
on
the
side
of
the
highest
cone
of
etna
underneath
a
lava
stream
with
an
intervening
bed
of
volcanic
sand
only
ten
feet
thick
this
was
visited
by
sir
charles
lyell
in
and
a
second
time
thirty
years
later
when
he
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
strata
and
was
quite
satisfied
that
the
sand
and
the
lava
stream
together
had
actually
preserved
this
mass
of
ice
which
neither
the
heat
of
the
lava
above
it
at
its
first
outflow
nor
the
continued
heat
rising
from
the
great
volcano
below
it
had
been
able
to
melt
or
perceptibly
to
diminish
in
thirty
years
another
fact
that
points
in
the
same
direction
is
the
existence
over
the
whole
floor
of
the
deepest
oceans
of
water
which
originating
in
the
polar
seas
owing
to
its
greater
density
sinks
and
creeps
slowly
along
the
ocean
bottom
to
the
depths
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
and
is
not
perceptibly
warmed
by
the
internal
heat
of
the
earth
now
the
solid
crust
of
the
earth
is
estimated
as
at
least
about
twenty
miles
in
average
thickness
and
keeping
in
mind
the
other
facts
just
referred
to
we
can
understand
that
the
heat
from
the
interior
passes
through
it
with
such
extreme
slowness
as
not
to
be
detected
at
the
surface
the
varying
temperatures
of
which
are
due
entirely
to
solar
heat
a
large
portion
of
this
heat
is
stored
up
in
the
surface
soil
and
especially
in
the
surface
layer
of
the
oceans
and
seas
thus
partly
equalising
the
temperatures
of
day
and
night
of
winter
and
summer
so
as
greatly
to
ameliorate
the
rapid
changes
of
temperature
that
would
otherwise
occur
our
dense
atmosphere
is
also
of
immense
advantage
to
us
as
an
equaliser
of
temperature
charged
as
it
almost
always
is
with
a
large
quantity
of
this
latter
gas
when
not
condensed
into
cloud
allows
the
solar
heat
to
pass
freely
to
the
earth
but
it
has
the
singular
and
highly
beneficial
property
of
absorbing
and
retaining
the
dark
or
heat
given
off
by
the
earth
which
would
otherwise
radiate
into
space
much
more
rapidly
we
must
therefore
always
remember
that
very
nearly
if
not
quite
the
of
warmth
we
experience
on
the
earth
is
derived
from
the
footnote
professor
poynting
in
his
lecture
to
the
british
association
at
cambridge
in
says
the
surface
of
the
earth
receives
we
know
an
amount
of
heat
from
the
inside
almost
infinitesimal
compared
with
that
which
it
receives
from
the
sun
and
on
the
sun
therefore
we
depend
for
our
temperature
in
order
to
understand
the
immense
significance
of
this
conclusion
we
must
know
what
is
meant
by
the
heat
or
warmth
as
unless
we
know
this
we
can
not
define
what
half
or
any
other
proportion
of
really
means
now
i
feel
pretty
sure
that
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
average
educated
public
would
answer
the
following
question
incorrectly
the
mean
temperature
of
the
southern
half
of
england
is
about
supposing
the
earth
received
only
half
the
it
now
receives
what
would
then
be
the
probable
mean
temperature
of
the
south
of
england
the
majority
would
i
think
answer
at
once
about
nearly
as
many
would
perhaps
say
is
above
the
freezing
point
therefore
half
the
heat
received
would
bring
us
down
to
above
the
freezing
point
or
very
few
i
think
would
realise
that
our
share
of
half
the
amount
of
received
by
the
earth
would
probably
result
in
reducing
our
mean
temperature
to
about
below
the
freezing
point
and
perhaps
even
lower
this
is
about
the
very
lowest
temperature
yet
experienced
on
the
earth
surface
to
understand
how
such
results
are
obtained
a
few
words
must
be
said
about
the
absolute
zero
of
temperature
zero
of
heat
is
now
believed
to
be
entirely
due
to
which
produces
a
correspondingly
rapid
vibration
of
the
molecules
of
matter
causing
it
to
expand
and
producing
all
the
phenomena
we
term
we
can
conceive
this
vibration
to
increase
indefinitely
and
thus
there
would
appear
to
be
no
necessary
limit
to
the
amount
of
heat
possible
but
we
can
not
conceive
it
to
decrease
indefinitely
at
the
same
uniform
rate
as
it
must
soon
inevitably
come
to
nothing
now
it
has
been
found
by
experiment
that
gases
under
uniform
pressure
expand
of
their
volume
for
each
degree
centigrade
of
increased
temperature
so
that
in
passing
from
to
they
are
doubled
in
volume
they
also
decrease
in
volume
at
the
same
rate
for
each
degree
below
the
freezing
point
of
water
hence
if
this
goes
on
a
gas
will
have
no
volume
or
it
will
undergo
some
change
of
nature
hence
this
is
called
the
zero
of
temperature
or
the
temperature
to
which
any
matter
falls
which
receives
no
heat
from
any
other
matter
it
is
also
sometimes
called
the
temperature
of
space
or
of
the
ether
in
a
state
of
rest
if
that
is
possible
all
the
gases
have
now
been
proved
to
become
first
liquid
and
then
most
of
them
solid
at
temperatures
considerably
above
this
zero
the
only
way
to
compare
the
proportional
temperatures
of
bodies
whether
on
the
earth
or
in
space
is
therefore
by
means
of
a
scale
beginning
at
this
natural
zero
instead
of
those
scales
founded
on
the
artificial
zero
of
the
freezing
point
of
water
or
as
in
fahrenheit
below
it
only
by
using
the
natural
zero
and
measuring
continuously
from
it
can
we
estimate
temperatures
in
relative
proportion
to
the
amount
of
heat
received
this
is
termed
the
absolute
zero
and
so
that
we
start
reckoning
from
that
point
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
scale
adopted
is
the
centigrade
or
that
of
fahrenheit
complex
problem
of
planetary
now
if
as
is
the
case
with
mars
a
planet
receives
only
half
the
amount
of
solar
heat
that
we
receive
owing
to
its
greater
distance
from
the
sun
and
if
the
mean
temperature
of
our
earth
is
this
is
equal
to
on
the
absolute
scale
it
would
therefore
appear
very
simple
to
halve
this
amount
and
obtain
as
the
mean
temperature
of
that
planet
but
this
result
is
erroneous
because
the
actual
amount
of
sun
heat
intercepted
by
a
planet
is
only
one
condition
out
of
many
that
determine
its
resulting
temperature
radiation
that
is
loss
of
heat
is
going
on
concurrently
with
gain
and
the
rate
of
loss
varies
with
the
temperature
according
to
a
law
recently
discovered
the
loss
being
much
greater
at
high
temperatures
in
proportion
to
the
power
of
the
absolute
temperature
then
again
the
whole
heat
intercepted
by
a
planet
does
not
reach
its
surface
unless
it
has
no
atmosphere
when
it
has
one
much
is
reflected
or
absorbed
according
to
complex
laws
dependent
on
the
density
and
composition
of
the
atmosphere
then
again
the
heat
that
reaches
the
actual
surface
is
partly
reflected
and
partly
absorbed
according
to
the
nature
of
that
surface
land
or
water
desert
or
forest
or
that
part
which
is
absorbed
being
the
chief
agent
in
raising
the
temperature
of
the
surface
and
of
the
air
in
contact
with
it
very
important
too
is
the
loss
of
heat
by
radiation
from
these
various
heated
surfaces
at
different
rates
while
the
atmosphere
itself
sends
back
to
the
surface
an
ever
varying
portion
of
both
this
radiant
and
reflected
heat
according
to
distinct
laws
further
difficulties
arise
from
the
fact
that
much
of
the
sun
heat
consists
of
dark
or
invisible
rays
and
it
can
not
therefore
be
measured
by
the
quantity
of
light
only
from
this
rough
statement
it
will
be
seen
that
the
problem
is
an
exceedingly
complex
one
not
to
be
decided
or
by
any
simple
method
it
has
in
fact
been
usually
considered
as
strictly
speaking
insoluble
and
only
to
be
estimated
by
a
more
or
less
rough
approximation
or
by
the
method
of
general
analogy
from
certain
known
facts
it
will
be
seen
from
what
has
been
said
in
previous
chapters
that
lowell
in
his
book
has
used
the
latter
method
and
by
taking
the
presence
of
water
and
in
mars
as
proved
by
the
behaviour
of
the
and
the
bluish
colour
that
results
from
their

published

with

to

by
what
purports
to
be
strict
mathematical
reasoning
based
on
the
most
recent

to
the
laws
of

well
as
on

and

he
arrives
at
a
conclusion
strikingly
accordant
with
that
put
forward

the
recently
published
volume
having
myself
neither
mathematical
nor
physical
knowledge
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
criticise
this
elaborate
paper
except
on
a
few
points
i
will
here
limit
myself
to
giving
a
short
account
of
it
so
as
to
explain
its
method
of
procedure
after
which
i
may
add
a
few
notes
on
what
seem
to
me
doubtful
points
while
i
also
hope
to
be
able
to
give
the
opinions
of
some
more
competent
critics
than
myself
lowell
mode
of
estimating
the
of
the
author
first
states
that
professor
young
in
his
makes
the
mean
temperature
of
mars
absolute
by
using
newton
law
of
heat
being
radiated
in
proportion
to
temperature
and
abs
by
dulong
and
petit
law
but
adds
that
a
closer
determination
has
been
made
by
professor
moulton
using
stefan
law
that
radiation
is
as
the
power
of
the
temperature
whence
results
a
mean
temperature
these
estimates
assume
identity
of
atmospheric
conditions
of
mars
and
the
earth
but
as
none
of
these
estimates
take
account
of
the
many
complex
factors
which
interfere
with
such
direct
and
simple
calculations
lowell
then
proceeds
to
enunciate
them
and
work
out
mathematically
the
effects
they
produce
the
whole
radiant
energy
of
the
sun
on
striking
a
planet
becomes
divided
as
follows
part
is
reflected
back
into
space
part
absorbed
by
the
atmosphere
part
transmitted
to
the
surface
of
the
planet
this
surface
again
reflects
a
portion
and
only
the
balance
left
goes
to
warm
the
planet
to
solve
this
complex
problem
we
are
helped
by
the
or
intrinsic
brilliancy
of
the
planets
which
depend
on
the
proportion
of
the
visible
rays
which
are
reflected
and
which
determines
the
comparative
brightness
of
their
respective
surfaces
we
also
have
to
find
the
ratio
of
the
invisible
to
the
visible
rays
and
the
heating
power
of
each
he
then
refers
to
the
actinometer
and
pyroheliometer
instruments
for
measuring
the
actual
heat
derived
from
the
sun
and
also
to
the
bolometer
an
instrument
invented
by
professor
langley
for
measuring
the
invisible
heat
rays
which
he
has
proved
to
extend
to
more
than
three
times
the
length
of
the
whole
as
previously
known
and
has
also
shown
that
the
invisible
rays
contribute
per
cent
of
the
sun
total
energy

then
follows
an
elaborate
estimate
of
the
loss
of
heat
during
the
passage
of
the
sun
rays
through
our
atmosphere
from
experiments
made
at
different
altitudes
and
from
the
estimated
reflective
power
of
the
various
parts
of
the
earth
surface
rocks
and
soil
ocean
forest
and
snow
the
final
result
being
that
of
the
whole
is
reflected
back
into
space
forming
our
while
only
is
absorbed
by
the
soil
and
goes
to
warm
the
air
and
determine
our
mean
temperature
we
now
have
another
elaborate
estimate
of
the
comparative
amounts
of
heat
actually
received
by
mars
and
the
earth
dependent
on
their
very
different
amounts
of
atmosphere
and
this
estimate
depends
almost
wholly
on
the
comparative
that
of
mars
as
observed
by
astronomers
being
while
ours
has
been
estimated
in
a
totally
different
way
as
being
whence
he
concludes
that
nearly
of
the
that
mars
receives
reaches
the
surface
and
determines
its
temperature
while
we
get
only
of
our
total
amount
then
by
applying
stefan
law
that
the
radiation
is
as
the
power
of
the
surface
temperature
he
reaches
the
final
result
that
the
actual
heating
power
at
the
surface
of
mars
is
considerably
than
on
the
earth
and
would
produce
a
mean
temperature
of
if
it
were
not
for
the
greater
conservative
or
blanketing
power
of
our
denser
and
more
atmosphere
the
difference
produced
by
this
latter
fact
he
minimises
by
dwelling
on
the
probability
of
a
greater
proportion
of
gas
and
in
the
martian
atmosphere
and
thus
brings
down
the
mean
temperature
of
mars
to
which
is
almost
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
the
southern
half
of
england
he
has
also
as
the
result
of
observations
reduced
the
probable
density
of
the
atmosphere
of
mars
to
inches
of
mercury
or
only
of
that
of
the
earth
remarks
on
lowell
the
last
part
of
this
paper
indicated
under
pars
and
is
the
most
elaborate
occupying
eight
pages
and
it
contains
much
that
seems
uncertain
if
not
erroneous
in
particular
it
seems
very
unlikely
that
under
a
clear
sky
over
the
whole
earth
we
should
only
receive
at
the
of
the
solar
rays
which
the
earth
intercepts
these
data
largely
depend
on
observations
made
in
california
and
other
parts
of
the
southern
united
states
where
the
lower
atmosphere
is
exceptionally
till
we
have
similar
observations
made
in
the
tropical
which
cover
so
large
an
area
and
where
the
atmosphere
is
purified
by
frequent
rains
and
also
on
the
prairies
and
the
great
oceans
we
can
not
trust
these
very
local
observations
for
general
conclusions
affecting
the
whole
earth
later
in
the
same
article
lowell
says
clouds
transmit
approximately
per
cent
of
the
heat
reaching
them
a
clear
sky
at
per
cent
as
the
sky
is
half
the
time
cloudy
the
mean
transmission
is
per
cent
these
statements
seem
incompatible
with
that
quoted
above
the
figure
he
uses
in
his
calculations
for
the
actual
albedo
of
the
earth
is
also
not
only
improbable
but
almost
because
the
albedo
of
cloud
is
and
that
of
the
great
planet
jupiter
is
given
by
lowell
as
while
zollner
made
it
only
again
lowell
gives
venus
an
albedo
of
while
zollner
made
it
only
and
gore
this
shows
the
extreme
uncertainty
of
these
estimates
while
the
fact
that
both
venus
and
jupiter
are
wholly
while
we
are
only
renders
it
almost
certain
that
our
albedo
is
far
less
than
lowell
makes
it
it
is
evident
that
mathematical
calculations
founded
upon
such
uncertain
data
can
not
yield
trustworthy
results
but
this
is
by
no
means
the
only
case
in
which
the
data
employed
in
this
paper
are
of
uncertain
value
everywhere
we
meet
with
figures
of
somewhat
doubtful
accuracy
here
we
have
somebody
quoted
there
another
person
and
these
are
adopted
without
further
remark
and
used
in
the
various
calculations
leading
to
the
result
above
quoted
it
requires
a
practised
mathematician
and
one
fully
acquainted
with
the
extensive
literature
of
this
subject
to
examine
these
various
data
and
track
them
through
the
maze
of
formulae
and
figures
so
as
to
determine
to
what
extent
they
affect
the
final
result
there
is
however
one
curious
oversight
which
i
must
refer
to
as
it
is
a
point
to
which
i
have
given
much
attention
not
only
does
lowell
assume
as
in
his
book
that
the
of
mars
consist
of
frozen
water
and
that
therefore
there
water
on
its
surface
and
in
its
atmosphere
not
only
does
he
ignore
altogether
johnstone
stoney
calculations
with
regard
to
it
which
i
have
already
referred
to
but
he
uses
terms
that
imply
that
is
one
of
the
heavier
components
of
our
atmosphere
the
passage
is
at
of
the
after
stating
that
owing
to
the
very
small
barometric
pressure
in
mars
water
would
boil
at
he
adds
the
sublimation
at
lower
temperatures
would
be
correspondingly
increased
consequently
the
amount
of
in
the
martian
air
must
on
that
score
be
relatively
greater
than
our
own
then
follows
this
remarkable
passage
because
of
its
greater
specific
gravity
would
also
be
in
relatively
greater
amount
so
far
as
this
cause
is
considered
for
the
planet
would
part
with
its
lighter
gases
the
quickest
whence
as
regards
both
and
we
have
reason
to
think
them
in
relatively
greater
quantity
than
in
our
own
air
at
corresponding
barometric
pressure
i
can
not
understand
this
passage
except
as
implying
that
and
are
among
the
heavier
and
not
among
the
lighter
gases
of
the
atmosphere
those
which
the
planet
with
quickest
but
this
is
just
what
being
a
little
less
than
the
weight
of
air
and
one
of
those
which
the
planet
part
with
the
quickest
and
which
according
to
johnstone
stoney
it
loses
altogether
note
on
professor
lowell
article
in
the
by
poynting
professor
of
physics
in
the
university
of
birmingham
i
think
professor
lowell
results
are
erroneous
through
his
neglect
of
the
heat
stored
in
the
air
by
its
absorption
of
radiation
both
from
the
sun
and
from
the
surface
the
air
thus
heated
radiates
to
the
surface
and
keeps
up
the
temperature
i
have
sent
to
the
a
paper
in
which
i
think
it
is
shown
that
when
the
radiation
by
the
atmosphere
is
taken
into
account
the
results
are
entirely
changed
the
temperature
of
mars
with
professor
lowell
data
still
comes
out
far
below
the
still
further
below
than
the
increased
distance
alone
would
make
it
indeed
the
lower
temperature
on
elevated
regions
of
the
earth
surface
would
lead
us
to
expect
this
i
think
it
is
impossible
to
raise
the
temperature
of
mars
to
anything
like
the
value
obtained
by
professor
lowell
unless
we
assume
some
quality
in
his
atmosphere
entirely
different
from
any
found
in
our
own
atmosphere

a
new
estimate
of
the
temperature
of
mars
when
we
are
presented
with
a
complex
problem
depending
on
a
great
number
of
imperfectly
ascertained
data
we
may
often
check
the
results
thus
obtained
by
the
comparison
of
cases
in
which
some
of
the
more
important
of
these
data
are
identical
while
others
are
at
a
maximum
or
a
minimum
in
the
present
case
we
can
do
this
by
a
consideration
of
the
moon
as
compared
with
the
earth
and
with
mars
determination
of
the
moon
in
the
moon
we
see
the
conditions
that
prevail
in
mars
both
exaggerated
and
simplified
mars
has
a
very
scanty
atmosphere
the
moon
none
at
all
or
if
there
is
one
it
is
so
excessively
scanty
that
the
most
refined
observations
have
not
detected
it
all
the
complications
arising
from
the
possible
nature
of
the
atmosphere
and
its
complex
effects
upon
reflection
absorption
and
radiation
are
thus
eliminated
the
mean
distance
of
the
moon
from
the
sun
being
identical
with
that
of
the
earth
the
total
amount
of
heat
intercepted
must
also
be
identical
only
in
this
case
the
whole
of
it
reaches
the
surface
instead
of
only
according
to
lowell
estimate
for
the
earth
now
by
the
most
refined
observations

his
bolometer
langley
was
able
to
determine
the
temperature
of
the
moon
surface
exposed
to
undimmed
sunshine
for
fourteen
days
together
and
he
found
that
even
in
that
portion
of
it
on
which
the
sun
was
shining
almost
vertically
the
temperature
rarely
rose
above
the
freezing
point
of
water
however
extraordinary
this
result
may
seem
it
is
really
a
striking
confirmation
of
the
accuracy
of
the
general
laws
determining
temperature
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
explain
in
the
preceding
chapter
for
the
same
surface
which
has
had
fourteen
days
of
sunshine
has
also
had
a
preceding
fourteen
days
of
darkness
during
which
the
heat
which
it
had
accumulated
in
its
surface
layers
would
have
been
lost
by
free
radiation
into
stellar
space
it
thus
acquires
during
its
day
a
maximum
temperature
of
only
absolute
while
its
minimum
after
continuous
radiation
must
be
very
low
and
is
with
much
reason
supposed
to
approach
the
absolute
zero
loss
of
heat
by
radiation
on
the
in
order
better
to
comprehend
what
this
minimum
may
be
under
extreme
conditions
it
will
be
useful
to
take
note
of
the
effects
it
actually
produces
on
the
earth
in
places
where
the
conditions
are
nearest
to
those
existing
on
the
moon
or
on
mars
though
never
quite
equalling
or
even
approaching
very
near
them
it
is
in
our
great
desert
regions
and
especially
on
high
plateaux
that
extreme
aridity
prevails
and
it
is
in
such
districts
that
the
differences
between
day
and
night
temperatures
reach
their
maximum
it
is
stated
by
geographers
that
in
parts
of
the
great
sahara
the
surface
temperature
is
sometimes
while
during
the
night
it
falls
nearly
or
quite
to
the
freezing
point
a
difference
of
degrees
in
little
more
than
hours
in
the
high
desert
plains
of
central
asia
the
extremes
are
said
to
be
even
greater
again
in
his
reclus
states
that
in
the
armenian
highlands
the
thermometer
oscillates
between
and
we
may
therefore
without
any
fear
of
exaggeration
take
it
as
proved
that
a
fall
of
in
twelve
or
fifteen
hours
not
infrequently
occurs
where
there
is
a
very
dry
and
clear
atmosphere
permitting
continuous
insolation
by
day
and
rapid
radiation
by
night
footnote
keith
johnston
in
footnote
art
now
as
it
is
admitted
that
our
dense
atmosphere
however
dry
and
clear
absorbs
and
reflects
some
considerable
portion
of
the
solar
heat
we
shall
certainly
underestimate
the
radiation
from
the
moon
surface
during
its
long
night
if
we
take
as
the
basis
of
our
calculation
a
lowering
of
temperature
amounting
to

twelve

not
unfrequently
occurs
with
us

these
data
with

of

of
radiation
as
the
power
of
the
temperature
a
mathematical
friend
finds
that
the
temperature
of
the

would
be
reduced
during

such
a

as
the
above
may
afford
us
a
good
approximation
to
the
rate
of
loss
of
heat
by
mars
with
its
very
scanty
atmosphere
we
have
now
good
evidence
that
in
the
case
of
the
moon
the
loss
is
much
more
rapid
two
independent
workers
have
investigated
this
subject
with
very
accordant
results
boeddicker
with
lord
reflector
and
a
thermopile
to
measure
the
heat
and
frank
very
with
a
glass
reflector
of
inches
diameter
and
the
bolometer
invented
by
langley
the
very
striking
and
unexpected
fact
in
which
these
observers
agree
is
the
sudden
disappearance
of
much
of
the
heat
during
the
comparatively
short
duration
of
a
total
eclipse
of
the
moon
less
than
two
hours
of
complete
darkness
and
about
twice
that
period
of
partial
obscuration
boeddicker
was
unable
to
detect
any
appreciable
heat
at
the
period
of
greatest
obscuration
but
owing
to
the
extreme
sensitiveness
of
the
bolometer
mr
very
ascertained
that
those
parts
of
the
surface
which
had
been
longest
in
the
shadow
still
emitted
heat
to
the
amount
of
one
per
cent
of
the
heat
to
be
expected
from
the
full
moon
this
however
is
the
amount
of
radiation
measured
by
the
bolometer
and
to
get
the
temperature
of
the
radiating
surface
we
must
apply
stefan
law
of
the
power
hence
the
temperature
of
the
moon
dark
surface
will
be
the
fourth
root
of
over
over
a
of
the
highest
temperature
which
we
may
take
at
the
f
abs
or
f
just
below
the
liquefaction
point
of
air
this
is
about
lower
than
the
amount
found
by
calculation
from
our
most
rapid
radiation
and
as
this
amount
is
produced
in
a
few
hours
it
is
not
too
much
to
expect
that
when
continued
for
more
than
two
weeks
the
lunar
night
it
might
reach
a
temperature
sufficient
to
liquefy
hydrogen

or
perhaps
even
below

this
extremely
rapid
loss
of
heat
by
radiation
at
first
sight
so
improbable
as
to
be
almost
incredible
may
perhaps
be
to
some
extent
explained
by
the
physical
constitution
of
the
moon
surface
which
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
does
not
appear
to
have
received
the
attention
it
deserves
it
is
clear
that
our
satellite
has
been
long
subjected
to
volcanic
eruptions
over
its
whole
visible
face
and
these
have
evidently
been
of
an
explosive
nature
so
as
to
build
up
the
very
lofty
cones
and
craters
as
well
as
thousands
of
smaller
ones
which
owing
to
the
absence
of
any
degrading
or
denuding
agencies
have
remained
piled
up
as
they
were
first
formed
this
highly
volcanic
structure
can
i
think
be
well
explained
by
an
origin
such
as
that
attributed
to
it
by
sir
george
darwin
and
which
has
been
so
well
described
by
sir
robert
ball
in
his
small
volume
and
these
astronomers
adduce
strong
evidence
that
the
earth
once
rotated
so
rapidly
that
the
equatorial
protuberance
was
almost
at
the
point
of
separation
from
the
planet
as
a
ring
before
this
occurred
however
the
tension
was
so
great
that
one
large
portion
of
the
protuberance
where
it
was
weakest
broke
away
and
began
to
move
around
the
earth
at
some
considerable
distance
from
it
as
about
of
the
bulk
of
the
earth
thus
escaped
it
must
have
consisted
of
a
considerable
portion
of
the
solid
crust
and
a
much
larger
quantity
of
the
liquid
or
interior
together
with
a
proportionate
amount
of
the
gases
which
we
know
formed
and
still
form
an
important
part
of
the
substance
as
the
surface
layers
of
the
earth
must
have
been
the
lightest
they
would
necessarily
when
broken
up
by
this
gigantic
convulsion
have
come
together
to
form
the
exterior
of
the
new
satellite
and
be
soon
adjusted
by
the
forces
of
gravity
and
tidal
disturbance
into
a
more
or
less
irregular
spheroidal
form
all
whose
interstices
and
cavities
would
be
filled
up
and
connected
together
by
the
liquid
or
mass
forced
up
between
them
as
the
moon
increased
its
distance
and
reduced
its
time
of
rotation
in
the
way
explained
by
sir
robert
ball
there
would
necessarily
commence
a
process
of
escape
of
the
imprisoned
gases
at
every
fissure
and
at
all
points
and
lines
of
weakness
giving
rise
to
numerous
volcanic
outlets
which
being
subjected
only
to
the
small
force
of
lunar
gravity
only
that
of
the
earth
would
in
the
course
of
ages
pile
up
those
gigantic
cones
and
ridges
which
form
its
great
characteristic
but
this
small
gravitative
power
of
the
moon
would
prevent
its
retaining
on
its
surface
any
of
the
gases
forming
our
atmosphere
which
would
all
escape
from
it
and
probably
be
recaptured
by
the
earth
by
no
process
of
external
aggregation
of
solid
matter
to
such
a
relatively
small
amount
as
that
forming
the
moon
even
if
the
aggregation
was
so
violent
as
to
produce
heat
enough
to
cause
liquefaction
could
any
such
volcanic
action
arise
by
gradual
cooling
in
the
absence
of
internal
gases
there
might
be
fissures
and
even
some
outflows
of
molten
rock
but
without
imprisoned
gases
and
especially
without
water
and
producing
explosive
outbursts
could
any
such
amount
of
scoriae
and
ashes
be
produced
as
were
necessary
for
the
building
up
of
the
vast
volcanic
cones
craters
and
craterlets
we
see
upon
the
surface
i
am
not
aware
that
either
sir
robert
ball
or
sir
george
darwin
have
adduced
this
highly
volcanic
condition
of
the
moon
surface
as
a
phenomenon
which
can
be
explained
by
our
satellite
having
been
thrown
off
a
very
much
larger
body
whose
gravitative
force
was
sufficient
to
acquire
and
retain
the
enormous
quantity
of
gases
and
of
water
which
we
possess
and
which
are
for
that
form
of
volcanic
which
the
moon
exhibits
in
so
a
degree
yet
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
some
such
hypothetical
origin
for
our
satellite
would
have
had
to
be
assumed
if
sir
george
darwin
had
not
deduced
it
by
means
of
purely
mathematical
argument
based
upon
astronomical
facts
returning
now
to
the
problem
of
the
moon
temperature
i
think
the
phenomena
this
presents
may
be
in
part
due
to
the
mode
of
formation
here
described
for
its
entire
surface
being
the
result
of
gaseous
explosions
all
the
volcanic
products
scoriae
pumice
and
ashes
would
necessarily
be
highly
porous
throughout
and
never
having
been
compacted
by
as
on
the
earth
and
there
having
been
no
winds
to
carry
the
finer
dust
so
as
to
fill
up
their
pores
and
fissures
the
whole
of
the
surface
material
to
a
very
considerable
depth
must
be
loose
and
porous
to
a
high
degree
this
condition
has
been
further
increased
owing
to
the
small
power
of
gravity
and
the
extreme
irregularity
of
the
surface
consisting
very
largely
of
lofty
cones
and
ridges
very
loosely
piled
up
to
enormous
heights
now
this
condition
of
the
substance
of
the
moon
surface
is
such
as
would
produce
a
high
specific
heat
so
that
it
would
absorb
a
large
amount
of
heat
in
proportion
to
the
rise
of
temperature
produced
the
heat
being
conducted
downwards
to
a
considerable
depth
owing
however
to
the
total
absence
of
atmosphere
radiation
would
very
rapidly
cool
the
surface
but
afterwards
more
slowly
both
on
account
of
the
action
of
stefan
law
and
because
the
heat
stored
up
in
the
deeper
portions
could
be
carried
to
the
surface
by
conduction
only
and
with
extreme
slowness
researches
on
the
moon
the
results
of
the
eclipse
observations
are
supported
by
the
detailed
examination
of
the
of
the
moon
by
mr
very
in
his
essay
on
the
distribution
of
the
moon
published
by
the
utrecht
society
of
arts
and
sciences
in
he
shows
by
a
diagram
of
the
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
lunar
day
the
surface
just
within
the
illuminated
limb
has
acquired
about
of
its
maximum
temperature
or
about
abs
as
the
surface
exposed
to
the
bolometer
at
each
observation
is
about
of
the
moon
surface
and
in
order
to
ensure
accuracy
the
instrument
has
to
be
directed
to
a
spot
lying
wholly
within
the
edge
of
the
moon
it
is
evident
that
the
surface
measured
has
already
been
for
several
hours
exposed
to
oblique
sunshine
the
curve
of
temperature
then
rises
gradually
and
afterwards
more
rapidly
till
it
attains
its
maximum
of
about
to
a
few
hours
noon
this
mr
very
thinks
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
half
of
the
moon
face
first
illuminated
for
us
has
on
the
average
a
darker
surface
than
that
of
the
afternoon
or
second
quarter
during
which
the
curve
descends
not
quite
so
rapidly
the
temperature
near
sunset
being
only
a
little
higher
than
that
near
sunrise
this
rapid
fall
while
exposed
to
oblique
sunshine
is
quite
in
harmony
with
the
rapid
loss
of
heat
during
the
few
hours
of
darkness
during
an
eclipse
both
showing
the
prepotency
of
radiation
over
insolation
on
the
moon
two
other
diagrams
show
the
distribution
of
heat
at
the
time
of
one
half
of
the
curve
showing
the
temperatures
along
the
equator
from
the
edge
of
the
disc
to
the
centre
the
other
along
a
meridian
from
this
centre
to
the
pole
this
diagram
here
reproduced
exhibits
the
quick
rise
of
temperature
of
the
oblique
rim
of
the
moon
and
the
nearly
uniform
heat
of
the
central
half
of
its
surface
the
diminution
of
heat
towards
the
pole
however
is
slower
for
the
first
half
and
more
rapid
for
the
latter
portion
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
the
temperature
near
the
margin
of
the
increases
towards
the
centre
more
rapidly
than
it
does
when
the
same
parts
are
observed
during
the
early
phases
of
the
first
quarter
mr
very
explains
this
difference
as
being
due
to
the
fact
that
the
to
its
very
edges
is
fully
illuminated
all
the
shadows
of
the
ridges
and
mountains
being
thrown
vertically
or
obliquely
we
thus
measure
the
heat
reflected
from
the
visible
surface
but
at
new
moon
and
somewhat
beyond
the
first
quarter
the
deep
shadows
thrown
by
the
smallest
cones
and
ridges
as
well
as
by
the
loftiest
mountains
cover
a
considerable
portion
of
the
visible
surface
thus
largely
reducing
the
quantity
of
light
and
heat
reflected
or
radiated
in
our
direction
it
is
only
at
the
full
therefore
that
the
maximum
temperature
of
the
whole
lunar
surface
can
be
measured
it
must
be
considered
a
proof
of
the
delicacy
of
the
instruments
that
this
difference
in
the
curves
of
temperature
of
the
different
parts
of
the
moon
surface
and
under
different
conditions
is
so
clearly
shown
application
of
the
preceding
results
to
the
case
of
this
somewhat
lengthy
account
of
the
actual
state
of
the
moon
surface
and
temperature
is
of
very
great
importance
in
our
present
enquiry
because
it
shows
us
the
extraordinary
difference
in
mean
and
extreme
temperatures
of
two
bodies
situated
at
the
same
distance
from
the
sun
and
therefore
receiving
exactly
the
same
amount
of
solar
heat
per
unit
of
surface
we
have
learned
also
what
are
the
main
causes
of
this
almost
incredible
difference
namely
a
remarkably
rugged
surface
with
porous
and
probably
cavernous
leading
to
extremely
rapid
radiation
of
heat
in
the
one
as
compared
with
a
comparatively
even
and
surface
largely
clad
with
vegetation
leading
to
comparatively
slow
and
gradual
loss
by
radiation
in
the
other
and
these
results
being
greatly
intensified
by
the
total
absence
of
a
protecting
atmosphere
in
the
former
while
a
dense
and
cloudy
atmosphere
with
an
supply
of
accumulates
and
equalises
the
heat
received
by
the
latter
the
only
other
essential
difference
in
the
two
bodies
which
may
possibly
aid
in
the
production
of
this
marvellous
result
is
the
fact
of
our
day
and
night
having
a
mean
length
of
hours
while
those
of
the
moon
are
about
of
our
days
but
the
altogether
unexpected
fact
in
which
two
independent
enquirers
agree
that
during
the
few
hours
duration
of
a
total
eclipse
of
the
moon
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
heat
is
lost
by
radiation
renders
it
almost
certain
that
the
resulting
low
temperature
would
be
not
very
much
less
if
the
moon
had
a
day
and
night
the
same
length
as
our
own
the
great
lesson
we
learn
by
this
extreme
contrast
of
conditions
supplied
to
us
by
nature
as
if
to
enable
us
to
solve
some
of
her
problems
is
the
overwhelming
importance
first
of
a
dense
and
surface
due
to
and
strong
gravitative
force
secondly
of
a
more
or
less
general
coat
of
vegetation
and
thirdly
of
a
dense
atmosphere
these
three
favourable
conditions
result
in
a
mean
temperature
of
about
with
a
range
seldom
exceeding
above
or
below
it
while
over
more
than
half
the
of
the
earth
the
temperature
rarely
falls
below
the
freezing
point
on
the
other
hand
we
have
a
globe
of
the
same
materials
and
at
the
same
distance
from
the
sun
with
a
maximum
temperature
of
freezing
water
and
a
minimum
not
very
far
from
the
absolute
zero
the
monthly
mean
being
probably
much
below
the
freezing
point
of
gas
a
difference
entirely
due
to
the
absence
of
these
three
favourable
conditions
special
features
of
mars
as
influencing
coming
now
to
the
special
feature
of
mars
and
its
probable
temperature
we
find
that
most
writers
have
arrived
at
a
very
different
conclusion
from
that
of
lowell
who
himself
quotes
moulton
as
an
authority
who
by
the
application
of
stefan
law
has
found
the
mean
temperature
of
this
planet
to
again
professor
poynting
in
his
lecture
on
in
the
solar
system
delivered
before
the
british
association
at
cambridge
in
gave
an
estimate
of
the
mean
temperature
of
the
planets
arrived
at
from
measurements
of
the
emissive
power
and
the
application
of
stefan
law
to
the
distances
of
the
several
planets
and
he
thus
finds
the
earth
to
have
a
mean
temperature
of
and
mars
one
a
wonderfully
close
approximation
to
the
mean
temperature
of
the
earth
as
determined
by
direct
measurement
and
therefore
presumably
an
equally
near
approximation
to
that
of
mars
as
dependent
on
distance
from
the
sun
and
the
supposition
that
it
is
in
all
its
but
we
know
that
it
is
far
from
being
in
the
very
conditions
which
we
have
found
to
be
those
which
determine
the
extremely
different
temperatures
of
the
earth
and
moon
and
as
regards
each
of
these
we
shall
find
that
so
far
as
it
differs
from
the
earth
it
approximates
to
the
less
favourable
conditions
that
prevail
in
the
moon
the
first
of
these
conditions
which
we
have
found
to
be
essential
in
regulating
the
absorption
and
radiation
of
heat
and
thus
raising
the
mean
temperature
of
a
planet
is
a
compact
surface
well
covered
with
vegetation
two
conditions
arising
from
and
absolutely
dependent
on
an
ample
amount
of
water
but
lowell
himself
assures
us
as
a
fact
of
which
he
has
no
doubt
that
there
are
no
permanent
bodies
of
water
great
or
small
upon
mars
that
rain
and
consequently
rivers
are
totally
wanting
that
its
sky
is
almost
constantly
clear
and
that
what
appear
to
be
clouds
are
not
formed
of
but
of
dust
he
dwells
emphatically
on
the
terrible
desert
conditions
of
the
greater
part
of
the
surface
of
the
planet
that
being
the
case
now
we
have
no
right
to
assume
that
it
has
ever
been
otherwise
and
taking
full
account
of
the
fact
neither
denied
nor
disputed
by
lowell
that
the
force
of
gravity
on
mars
is
not
sufficient
to
retain
in
its
atmosphere
we
must
conclude
that
the
surface
of
that
planet
like
that
of
the
moon
has
been
moulded
by
some
form
of
volcanic
action
modified
probably
by
wind
but
not
by
water
adding
to
this
that
the
force
of
gravity
on
mars
is
nearer
that
of
the
moon
than
to
that
of
the
earth
and
we
may
r
reasonably
conclude
that
its
surface
is
formed
of
volcanic
matter
in
a
light
and
porous
condition
and
therefore
highly
favourable
for
the
rapid
loss
of
surface
heat
by
radiation
the
of
mars
are
therefore
presumably
much
more
like
those
of
the
moon
than
like
those
of
the
earth
the
next
condition
favourable
to
the
storing
up
of
heat
a
covering
of
vegetation
is
almost
certainly
absent
from
mars
except
possibly
over
limited
areas
and
for
short
periods
in
this
feature
also
the
surface
of
mars
approximates
much
nearer
to
lunar
than
to
the
third
condition
a
dense
atmosphere
is
also
wanting
in
mars
for
although
it
possesses
an
atmosphere
it
is
estimated
by
lowell
in
his
latest
article
to
have
a
pressure
equivalent
to
only
inches
of
mercury
with
us
giving
it
a
density
of
only
part
that
of
ours
while
aqueous
vapour
the
chief
accumulator
of
heat
can
not
permanently
exist
in
it
and
notwithstanding
repeated
spectroscopic
observations
for
the
purpose
of
detecting
it
has
never
been
proved
to
exist
i
submit
that
i
have
now
shown
from
the
statements
and
largely
as
the
result
of
the
observations
of
lowell
himself
that
so
far
as
the
physical
conditions
of
mars
are
known
to
differ
from
those
of
the
earth
the
differences
are
all
to
the
conservation
and
to
the
dissipation
of
the
scanty
heat
it
receives
from
the
sun
that
they
point
unmistakeably
towards
the
temperature
conditions
of
the
moon
rather
than
to
those
of
the
earth
and
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
these
adverse
conditions
acting
upon
a
reduced
by
solar
distance
to
less
than
of
ours
result
in
a
mean
temperature
as
well
as
in
the
extremes
nearer
to
that
of
our
satellite
than
to
that
of
our
own
earth
criticism
of
lowell
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
test
some
further
conclusions
of
lowell
article
by
comparison
with
actual
phenomena
we
have
seen
in
the
outline
i
have
given
of
this
article
that
he
endeavours
to
show
how
the
small
amount
of
solar
heat
received
by
mars
is
counterbalanced
largely
by
the
greater
transparency
to
light
and
heat
of
its
thin
and
cloudless
atmosphere
and
partially
also
by
a
greater
conservative
or
power
of
its
atmosphere
due
to
the
presence
in
it
of
a
large
proportion
of
carbonic
acid
gas
and
aqueous
vapour
the
first
of
these
statements
may
be
admitted
as
a
fact
which
he
is
entitled
to
dwell
upon
but
the
second
the
presence
of
large
quantities
of
and
aqueous
vapour
is
a
pure
hypothesis
unsupported
by
any
item
of
scientific
evidence
while
in
the
case
of
aqueous
vapour
it
is
directly
opposed
to
admitted
results
founded
upon
the
molecular
theory
of
gaseous
elasticity
but
although
lowell
refers
to
the
conservative
or
effect
of
the
atmosphere
he
does
not
consider
or
allow
for
its
very
great
cumulative
effect
as
is
strikingly
shown
by
the
comparison
with
the
actual
temperature
conditions
of
the
moon
this
cumulative
effect
is
due
to
the
reflection
and
radiation
of
heat
from
the
clouds
as
well
as
from
the
strata
of
air
in
our
lower
atmosphere
which
latter
though
very
transparent
to
the
luminous
and
accompanying
heat
rays
of
the
sun
are
opaque
to
the
dark
whether
radiated
or
reflected
from
the
earth
surface
we
are
therefore
in
a
position
strictly
comparable
with
that
of
the
interior
of
some
huge
glass
house
which
not
only
becomes
intensely
heated
by
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
but
also
to
a
less
degree
by
reflected
rays
from
the
sky
and
those
radiated
from
the
clouds
so
that
even
on
a
cloudy
or
misty
day
its
temperature
rises
many
degrees
above
that
of
the
outer
air
such
a
building
if
of
large
size
of
suitable
form
and
well
protected
at
night
by
blinds
or
other
covering
might
be
so
arranged
as
to
accumulate
heat
in
its
soil
and
walls
so
as
to
maintain
a
tolerably
uniform
temperature
though
exposed
to
a
considerable
range
of
external
heat
and
cold
it
is
to
such
a
power
of
accumulation
of
heat
in
our
soil
and
lower
atmosphere
that
we
must
impute
the
overwhelming
contrast
between
our
climate
and
that
of
the
moon
with
us
the
solar
heat
that
penetrates
our
and
cloudy
atmosphere
is
shut
in
by
that
same
atmosphere
accumulates
there
for
weeks
and
months
together
and
can
only
slowly
escape
it
is
this
great
cumulative
power
which
lowell
has
not
taken
account
of
while
he
certainly
has
not
estimated
the
enormous
loss
of
heat
by
free
radiation
which
entirely
neutralises
the
effects
of
increase
of
however
great
when
these
cumulative
agencies
are
not
present
footnote
the
effects
of
this
power
of
a
dense
atmosphere
are
further
discussed
and
illustrated
in
the
last
chapter
of
this
book
where
i
show
that
the
universal
fact
of
steadily
diminishing
temperatures
at
high
altitudes
is
due
solely
to
the
diminution
of
this
cumulative
power
of
our
atmosphere
and
that
from
this
cause
alone
the
temperature
of
mars
must
be
that
which
would
be
found
on
a
lofty
plateau
about
feet
higher
than
the
average
of
the
peaks
of
the
andes
on
polar
regions
of
there
is
also
a
further
consideration
which
i
think
lowell
has
altogether
omitted
to
discuss
whatever
may
be
the
temperature
of
mars
we
must
take
account
of
the
long
nights
in
its
polar
and
latitudes
lasting
nearly
twice
as
long
as
ours
with
the
resulting
lowering
of
temperature
by
radiation
into
a
constantly
clear
sky
even
in
siberia
in
lat
a
cold
has
been
attained
while
over
a
large
portion
of
asia
and
america
above
lat
the
january
temperature
is
and
the
whole
subsoil
is
permanently
frozen
from
a
depth
of
or
feet
to
several
hundreds
but
the
winter
temperatures
the
same
in
mars
must
be
very
much
lower
and
it
must
require
a
proportionally
larger
amount
of
its
feeble
to
raise
the
surface
even
to
the
and
an
additional
very
large
amount
to
melt
any
considerable
depth
of
snow
but
this
identical
area
from
a
little
below
to
the
pole
is
that
occupied
by
the
of
mars
and
over
the
whole
of
it
the
winter
temperature
must
be
far
lower
than
the
then
as
the
martian
summer
comes
on
there
is
less
than
half
the
available
to
raise
this
low
temperature
after
a
winter
nearly
double
the
length
of
ours
and
when
the
summer
does
come
with
its
scanty
that
heat
is
not
accumulated
as
it
is
by
our
dense
and
atmosphere
the
marvellous
effects
of
which
we
have
already
shown
yet
with
all
these
adverse
conditions
each
assisting
the
other
to
produce
a
climate
approximating
to
that
which
the
earth
would
have
if
it
had
no
atmosphere
but
retaining
our
superiority
over
mars
in
receiving
double
the
amount
of
we
are
asked
to
accept
a
mean
temperature
for
the
more
distant
planet
almost
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
mild
and
equable
southern
england
and
a
disappearance
of
the
vast
snowfields
of
its
polar
regions
as
rapid
and
complete
as
what
occurs
with
us
if
the
moon
even
at
its
equator
has
not
its
temperature
raised
above
the
of
water
how
can
the
more
mars
with
its
sun
falling
upon
the
receive
heat
enough
first
to
raise
their
temperature
to
and
then
to
melt
with
marked
rapidity
the
vast
frozen
plains
of
its
polar
regions
lowell
is
however
so
regardless
of
the
ordinary
teachings
of
meteorological
science
that
he
actually
accounts
for
the
supposed
mild
climate
of
the
polar
regions
of
mars
by
the
absence
of
water
on
its
surface
and
in
its
atmosphere
he
concludes
his
fifth
chapter
with
the
following
words
could
our
earth
but
get
rid
of
its
oceans
we
too
might
have
temperate
regions
stretching
to
the
poles
here
he
runs
counter
to
two
of
the
laws
of
terrestrial
climatology
the
wonderful
equalising
effects
of
warm
which
are
the
chief
agents
in
diminishing
polar
cold
the
equally
striking
effects
of
warm
moist
winds
derived
from
these
oceans
and
the
great
storehouse
of
heat
we
possess
in
our
atmosphere
its
vapour
being
primarily
derived
from
these
same
oceans
but
in
lowell
opinion
all
our
meteorologists
are
quite
mistaken
our
oceans
are
our
great
drawbacks
only
get
rid
of
them
and
we
should
enjoy
the
exquisite
climate
of
mars
with
its
absence
of
clouds
and
fog
of
rain
or
rivers
and
its
delightful
expanses
of
perennial
deserts
varied
towards
the
poles
by
a
scanty
in
winter
the
melting
of
which
might
with
great
care
supply
us
with
the
necessary
moisture
to
grow
wheat
and
cabbages
for
about
or
more
likely
of
our
present
population
i
hope
i
may
be
excused
for
not
treating
such
an
argument
seriously
the
various
considerations
now
advanced
especially
those
which
show
the
enormous
cumulative
and
conservative
effect
of
our
dense
and
atmosphere
and
the
disastrous
effect
judging
by
the
actual
condition
of
the
moon
which
the
loss
of
it
would
have
upon
our
temperature
seem
to
me
quite
sufficient
to
demonstrate
important
errors
in
the
data
or
fallacies
in
the
complex
mathematical
argument
by
which
lowell
has
attempted
to
uphold
his
views
as
to
the
temperature
and
consequent
climatic
conditions
of
mars
in
concluding
this
portion
of
my
discussion
of
the
problem
of
mars
i
wish
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
my
argument
founded
upon
a
comparison
of
the
physical
conditions
of
the
earth
and
moon
with
those
of
mars
is
dependent
upon
a
small
number
of
generally
admitted
scientific
facts
while
the
conclusions
drawn
from
those
facts
are
simple
and
direct
requiring
no
mathematical
knowledge
to
follow
them
or
to
appreciate
their
weight
and
cogency
i
claim
for
them
therefore
that
they
are
in
no
degree
speculative
but
in
their
data
and
methods
exclusively
scientific
in
the
next
chapter
i
will
put
forward
a
suggestion
as
to
how
the
very
curious
markings
upon
the
surface
of
mars
may
possibly
be
interpreted
so
as
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
planet
actual
physical
condition
and
its
not
improbable
origin
and
past
history
chapter
vii
a
suggestion
as
to
the
of
mars
the
special
characteristics
of
the
numerous
lines
which
intersect
the
whole
of
the
equatorial
and
temperate
regions
of
mars
are
their
straightness
combined
with
their
enormous
length
it
is
this
which
has
led
lowell
to
term
them
features
schiaparelli
in
his
earlier
drawings
showed
them
curved
and
of
comparatively
great
width
later
he
found
them
to
be
straight
fine
lines
when
seen
under
the
best
conditions
just
as
lowell
has
always
seen
them
in
the
pure
atmosphere
of
his
observatory
both
of
these
observers
were
at
first
doubtful
of
their
reality
but
persistent
observation
continued
at
many
successive
oppositions
compelled
acceptance
of
them
as
actual
features
of
the
planet
disc
so
many
other
observers
have
now
seen
them
that
the
objection
of
unreality
seems
no
longer
valid
lowell
urges
however
that
their
perfect
straightness
their
extreme
tenuity
their
uniformity
throughout
their
whole
length
the
dual
character
of
many
of
them
their
relation
to
the
and
the
form
and
position
of
these
round
black
spots
are
all
proofs
of
artificiality
and
are
suggestive
of
design
and
considering
that
some
of
them
are
actually
as
long
as
from
boston
to
san
francisco
and
relatively
to
their
globe
as
long
as
from
london
to
bombay
his
objection
that
no
natural
phenomena
within
our
knowledge
show
such
regularity
on
such
a
scale
seems
at
first
a
mighty
one
it
is
certainly
true
that
we
can
point
to
nothing
exactly
like
them
either
on
the
earth
or
on
the
moon
and
these
are
the
only
two
planetary
bodies
we
are
in
a
position
to
compare
with
mars
yet
even
these
do
i
think
afford
us
some
hints
towards
an
interpretation
of
the
mysterious
lines
but
as
our
knowledge
of
the
internal
structure
and
past
history
even
of
our
earth
is
still
imperfect
that
of
the
moon
only
conjectural
and
that
of
mars
a
perfect
blank
it
is
not
perhaps
surprising
that
the
of
the
latter
do
not
correspond
with
those
of
either
of
the
others
pickering
the
best
clue
to
a
natural
interpretation
of
the
strange
features
of
the
surface
of
mars
is
that
suggested
by
the
american
astronomer
pickering
in
briefly
it
is
that
both
the
of
mars
and
the
rifts
as
well
as
the
luminous
streaks
on
the
moon
are
cracks
in
the
volcanic
crust
caused
by
internal
stresses
due
to
the
action
of
the
heated
interior
these
cracks
he
considers
to
be
symmetrically
arranged
with
regard
to
small
because
they
have
originated
from
them
just
as
the
white
streaks
on
the
moon
radiate
from
the
larger
craters
as
centres
he
further
supposes
that
water
and
issue
from
the
interior
into
these
fissures
and
in
conjunction
with
sunlight
promote
the
growth
of
vegetation
owing
to
the
very
rare
atmosphere
the
vapours
he
thinks
would
not
ascend
but
would
roll
down
the
outsides
of
the
craterlets
and
along
the
borders
of
the
canals
thus
irrigating
the
immediate
vicinity
and
serving
to
promote
the
growth
of
some
form
of
vegetation
which
renders
the
canals
and
oases
visible
footnote
vol
p
this
opinion
is
especially
important
because
next
to
lowell
pickering
is
perhaps
the
astronomer
who
has
given
most
attention
to
mars
during
the
last
fifteen
years
he
was
for
some
time
at
flagstaff
with
lowell
and
it
was
he
who
discovered
the
oases
or
craterlets
and
who
originated
the
idea
that
we
did
not
see
the
themselves
but
only
the
vegetable
growth
on
their
borders
he
also
observed
mars
in
the
southern
hemisphere
at
arequipa
and
he
has
since
made
an
elaborate
study
of
the
moon
by
means
of
a
specially
constructed
telescope
of
feet
focal
length
which
produced
a
direct
image
on
photographic
plates
nearly
inches
in
diameter
footnote
vol
may
supplement
it
is
clear
therefore
that
lowell
views
as
to
the
artificial
nature
of
the
of
mars
are
not
accepted
by
an
astronomer
of
equal
knowledge
and
still
wider
experience
yet
professor
alternative
view
is
more
a
suggestion
than
an
explanation
because
there
is
no
attempt
to
account
for
the
enormous
length
and
perfect
straightness
of
the
lines
on
mars
so
different
from
anything
that
is
found
either
on
our
earth
or
on
the
moon
there
must
evidently
be
some
great
peculiarity
of
structure
or
of
conditions
on
mars
to
account
for
these
features
and
i
shall
now
attempt
to
point
out
what
this
peculiarity
is
and
how
it
may
have
arisen
meteoritic
during
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
a
considerable
change
has
come
over
the
opinions
of
astronomers
as
regards
the
probable
origin
of
the
solar
system
the
large
amount
of
knowledge
of
the
stellar
universe
and
especially
of
nebulae
of
comets
and
of
which
we
now
possess
together
with
many
other
phenomena
such
as
the
constitution
of
saturn
rings
the
great
number
and
extent
of
the
minor
planets
and
generally
of
the
vast
amount
of
matter
in
the
form
of
and
meteoric
dust
in
and
around
our
system
have
all
pointed
to
a
different
origin
for
the
planets
and
their
satellites
than
that
formulated
by
laplace
as
the
nebular
hypothesis
it
is
now
seen
more
clearly
than
at
any
earlier
period
that
most
of
the
planets
possess
special
characteristics
which
distinguish
them
from
one
another
and
that
such
an
origin
as
laplace
suggested
the
slow
cooling
and
contraction
of
one
vast
or
nebula
besides
presenting
inherent
difficulties
many
think
them
impossibilities
in
itself
does
not
afford
an
adequate
explanation
of
these
peculiarities
hence
has
arisen
what
is
termed
the
meteoritic
theory
which
has
been
ably
advocated
for
many
years
by
sir
norman
lockyer
and
with
some
unimportant
modifications
is
now
becoming
widely
accepted
briefly
this
theory
is
that
the
planets
have
been
formed
by
the
slow
aggregation
of
solid
particles
around
centres
of
greatest
condensation
but
as
many
of
my
readers
may
be
altogether
unacquainted
with
it
i
will
here
give
a
very
clear
statement
of
what
it
is
from
professor
presidential
address
to
the
geological
section
of
the
british
association
of
the
present
year
he
began
by
saying
that
these
modern
views
were
of
far
more
practical
use
to
men
of
science
than
that
of
laplace
and
that
they
give
us
a
history
of
the
world
consistent
with
the
actual
records
of
geology
he
then
continues
according
to
sir
norman
lockyer
meteoritic
hypothesis
nebulae
comets
and
many
stars
consist
of
swarms
of
meteorites
which
though
normally
cold
and
dark
are
heated
by
repeated
collisions
and
so
become
luminous
they
may
even
be
volatilised
into
glowing
meteoric
vapour
but
in
time
this
heat
is
dissipated
and
the
force
of
gravity
condenses
a
meteoritic
swarm
into
a
single
globe
of
the
swarms
are
says
lockyer
members
of
the
solar
system
and
some
of
these
travel
round
the
sun
in
nearly
circular
orbits
like
planets
they
may
be
regarded
as
infinitesimal
planets
and
so
chamberlain
calls
them
the
planetismal
theory
is
a
development
of
the
meteoritic
theory
and
presents
it
in
an
especially
attractive
guise
it
regards
meteorites
as
very
sparsely
distributed
through
space
and
gravity
as
powerless
to
collect
them
into
dense
groups
so
it
assigns
the
parentage
of
the
solar
system
to
a
spiral
nebula
composed
of
planetismals
and
the
planets
as
formed
from
knots
in
the
nebula
where
many
planetismals
had
been
concentrated
near
the
intersections
of
their
orbits
these
groups
of
meteorites
already
as
dense
as
a
swarm
of
bees
were
then
packed
closer
by
the
influence
of
gravity
and
the
contracting
mass
was
heated
by
the
pressure
even
above
the
normal
of
the
material
which
was
kept
rigid
by
the
weight
of
the
overlying
layers
now
adopting
this
theory
as
the
last
word
of
science
upon
the
subject
of
the
origin
of
planets
we
see
that
it
affords
immense
scope
for
diversity
in
results
depending
on
the
total
of
matter
available
within
the
range
of
attraction
of
an
incipient
planetary
mass
and
the
at
which
this
matter
becomes
available
by
a
special
combination
of
these
two
quantities
which
have
almost
certainly
been
different
for
each
planet
i
think
we
may
be
able
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
structure
and
physical
features
of
mars
probable
mode
of
origin
of
this
planet
lying
between
two
of
much
greater
mass
has
evidently
had
less
material
from
which
to
be
formed
by
aggregation
and
if
we
assume
as
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
we
have
a
right
to
do
that
its
beginnings
were
not
much
later
or
earlier
than
those
of
the
earth
then
its
smaller
size
shows
that
it
has
in
all
probability
aggregated
very
much
more
slowly
but
the
internal
heat
acquired
by
a
planet
while
forming
in
this
manner
will
depend
upon
the
rate
at
which
it
aggregates
and
the
velocity
with
which
the
planetismals
fall
into
it
and
this
velocity
will
increase
with
its
mass
and
consequent
force
of
gravity
in
the
early
stages
of
a
planet
growth
it
will
probably
remain
cold
the
small
amount
of
heat
produced
by
each
impact
being
lost
by
radiation
before
the
next
one
occurs
and
with
a
small
and
slowly
aggregating
planet
this
condition
will
prevail
till
it
approaches
its
full
size
then
only
will
its
gravitative
force
be
sufficient
to
cause
incoming
matter
to
fall
upon
it
with
so
powerful
an
impact
as
to
produce
intense
heat
further
the
compressive
force
of
a
small
planet
will
be
a
less
effective
agency
than
in
the
case
of
a
larger
one
the
earth
we
know
has
acquired
a
large
amount
of
internal
heat
probably
sufficient
to
liquefy
its
whole
interior
but
mars
has
only
part
the
mass
of
the
earth
and
it
is
quite
possible
and
even
probable
that
its
comparatively
small
attractive
force
would
never
have
liquefied
or
even
permanently
heated
the
more
central
portions
of
its
mass
this
being
admitted
i
suggest
the
following
course
of
events
as
quite
possible
and
not
even
improbable
in
the
case
of
this
planet
during
the
whole
of
its
early
growth
and
till
it
acquired
nearly
its
present
diameter
its
rate
of
aggregation
was
so
slow
that
the
planetismals
falling
upon
it
though
they
might
have
been
heated
and
even
partially
liquefied
by
the
impact
were
never
in
such
quantity
as
to
produce
any
considerable
heating
effect
on
the
whole
mass
and
each
local
rise
of
temperature
was
soon
lost
by
radiation
the
planet
thus
grew
as
a
solid
and
cold
mass
compacted
together
by
the
impact
of
the
incoming
matter
as
well
as
by
its
slowly
increasing
gravitative
force
but
when
it
had
attained
to
within
perhaps
perhaps
miles
or
less
of
its
present
diameter
a
great
change
occurred
in
the
opportunity
for
further
growth
some
large
and
dense
swarm
of
meteorites
perhaps
containing
a
number
of
bodies
of
the
size
of
the
asteroids
came
within
the
range
of
the
sun
attraction
and
were
drawn
by
it
into
an
orbit
which
crossed
that
of
mars
at
such
a
small
angle
that
the
planet
was
able
at
each
revolution
to
capture
a
considerable
number
of
them
the
result
might
then
be
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
earth
the
continuous
inpour
of
the
fresh
matter
first
heated
and
later
on
liquefied
the
greater
part
of
it
as
well
perhaps
as
a
thin
layer
of
the
planet
original
surface
so
that
when
in
due
course
the
whole
of
the
had
been
captured
mars
had
acquired
its
present
mass
but
would
consist
of
an
intensely
heated
and
either
liquid
or
plastic
thin
outer
shell
resting
upon
a
cold
and
solid
interior
the
size
and
position
of
the
two
recently
discovered
satellites
of
mars
which
are
believed
to
be
not
more
than
ten
miles
in
diameter
the
more
remote
revolving
around
its
primary
very
little
slower
than
the
planet
rotates
while
the
nearer
one
which
is
considerably
less
distant
from
the
planet
surface
than
its
own
antipodes
and
revolves
around
it
more
than
three
times
during
the
martian
day
may
perhaps
be
looked
upon
as
the
remnants
of
the
great
which
completed
the
martian
development
and
which
are
perhaps
themselves
destined
at
some
distant
period
to
fall
into
the
planet
should
future
astronomers
witness
the
phenomenon
the
effect
produced
upon
its
surface
would
be
full
of
instruction
as
the
result
of
such
an
origin
as
that
suggested
mars
would
possess
a
structure
which
in
the
essential
feature
of
would
be
the
very
opposite
of
that
which
is
believed
to
characterise
the
earth
yet
it
might
have
been
produced
by
a
very
slight
modification
of
the
same
process
this
peculiar
together
with
a
much
smaller
mass
and
gravitative
force
would
lead
to
a
very
different
development
of
the
surface
and
an
altogether
diverse
geological
history
from
ours
which
has
throughout
been
profoundly
influenced
by
its
heated
interior
its
vast
supply
of
water
and
the
continuous
physical
and
chemical
reactions
between
the
interior
and
the
crust
these
reactions
have
in
our
case
been
of
substantially
the
same
nature
and
very
nearly
of
the
same
degree
of
intensity
throughout
the
whole
vast
eons
of
geological
time
and
they
have
resulted
in
a
wonderfully
complex
succession
of
volcanic
plutonic
and
sedimentary
more
or
less
intermingled
throughout
the
whole
series
here
remaining
horizontal
as
when
first
deposited
there
upheaved
or
depressed
fractured
or
crushed
inclined
or
contorted
denuded
by
rain
and
rivers
with
the
assistance
of
heat
and
cold
of
frost
and
ice
in
an
unceasing
series
of
changes
so
that
however
varied
the
surface
may
be
with
hill
and
dale
plains
and
uplands
mountain
ranges
and
deep
intervening
valleys
these
are
as
nothing
to
the
diversities
of
interior
structure
as
exhibited
in
the
sides
of
every
alpine
valley
or
precipitous
escarpment
and
made
known
to
us
by
the
work
of
the
miner
and
the
in
every
part
of
the
world
straight
lines
on
the
the
great
characteristic
of
the
earth
both
on
its
surface
and
in
its
interior
is
thus
seen
to
be
extreme
diversity
both
of
form
and
structure
and
this
is
further
intensified
by
the
varied
texture
constitution
hardness
and
density
of
the
various
rocks
and
debris
of
which
it
is
composed
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
with
such
a
complex
outer
crust
we
should
nowhere
find
examples
of
those
geometrical
forms
and
almost
straight
lines
that
give
such
a
remarkable
and
as
lowell
maintains
character
to
the
surface
of
mars
but
which
as
it
seems
to
me
of
themselves
afford
evidence
of
a
corresponding
simplicity
and
uniformity
in
its
internal
structure
yet
we
are
not
ourselves
by
any
means
devoid
of
structurally
produced
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
of
diversity
of
form
and
texture
of
softness
and
hardness
of
lamination
or
crystallisation
which
are
adverse
to
such
developments
examples
of
these
are
the
numerous
which
occur
in
the
harder
rocks
and
which
often
extend
for
great
distances
in
almost
perfect
straight
lines
in
our
own
country
we
have
the
tyneside
and
craven
faults
in
the
north
of
england
which
are
miles
long
and
often
yards
wide
but
even
more
striking
is
the
great
cleveland
dyke
a
wall
of
volcanic
rock
dipping
slightly
towards
the
south
but
sometimes
being
almost
vertical
and
stretching
across
the
country
over
hill
and
dale
in
an
almost
perfect
straight
line
from
a
point
on
the
coast
ten
miles
north
of
scarborough
in
a
direction
passing
about
two
miles
south
of
stockton
and
terminating
about
six
miles
of
barnard
castle
a
distance
of
very
nearly
miles
the
great
fault
between
the
highlands
and
lowlands
of
scotland
extends
across
the
country
from
stonehaven
to
near
helensburgh
a
distance
of
miles
and
there
are
very
many
more
of
less
importance
much
more
extensive
are
some
of
the
great
continental
dislocations
often
forming
valleys
of
considerable
width
and
length
the
upper
rhine
flows
in
one
of
these
great
valleys
of
subsidence
for
about
miles
from
mulhausen
to
frankfort
in
a
generally
straight
line
though
modified
by
denudation
vaster
still
is
the
valley
of
the
jordan
through
the
sea
of
galilee
to
the
dead
sea
continued
by
the
wady
arabah
to
the
gulf
of
akaba
believed
to
form
one
vast
geological
depression
or
fracture
extending
in
a
straight
line
for
miles
thousands
of
such
faults
dykes
or
depressions
exist
in
every
part
of
the
world
all
believed
to
be
due
to
the
gradual
shrinking
of
the
heated
interior
to
which
the
solid
crust
has
to
accommodate
itself
and
they
are
especially
interesting
and
instructive
for
our
present
purpose
as
showing
the
tendency
of
such
fractures
of
solid
to
extend
to
great
lengths
in
straight
lines
notwithstanding
the
extreme
irregularity
both
in
the
surface
contour
as
well
as
in
the
internal
structures
of
the
varied
deposits
and
formations
through
which
they
pass
origin
of
the
of
returning
now
to
mars
let
us
consider
the
probable
course
of
events
from
the
point
at
which
we
left
it
the
heat
produced
by
impact
and
condensation
would
be
likely
to
release
gases
which
had
been
in
combination
with
some
of
the
solid
matter
or
perhaps
been
itself
in
a
solid
state
due
to
intense
cold
and
these
escaping
outwards
to
the
surface
would
produce
on
a
small
scale
a
certain
amount
of
upheaval
and
volcanic
disturbance
and
as
an
outer
crust
rapidly
formed
a
number
of
vents
might
remain
as
craters
or
craterlets
in
a
moderate
state
of
activity
owing
to
the
comparatively
small
force
of
gravity
the
outer
crust
would
become
scoriaceous
and
more
or
less
permeated
by
the
gases
which
would
continue
to
escape
through
it
and
this
would
facilitate
the
cooling
of
the
whole
of
the
heated
outer
crust
and
allow
it
to
become
rather
densely
compacted
when
the
greater
portion
of
the
gases
had
thus
escaped
to
the
outer
surface
and
assisted
to
form
a
scanty
atmosphere
such
as
now
exists
there
would
be
no
more
internal
disturbance
and
the
cooling
of
the
heated
outer
coating
would
steadily
progress
resulting
at
last
in
a
slightly
heated
and
later
in
a
cold
layer
of
moderate
thickness
and
great
general
uniformity
owing
to
the
absence
of
rain
and
rivers
denudation
such
as
we
experience
would
be
unknown
though
the
superficial
scoriaceous
crust
might
be
partially
broken
up
by
expansion
and
contraction
and
suffer
a
certain
amount
of
atmospheric
erosion
the
final
result
of
this
mode
of
aggregation
would
be
that
the
planet
would
consist
of
an
outer
layer
of
moderate
thickness
as
compared
with
the
central
mass
which
outer
layer
would
have
cooled
from
a
highly
heated
state
to
a
temperature
considerably
below
the
and
this
would
have
been
all
the
time
upon
a
previously
cold
and
therefore
the
result
would
be
that
very
early
in
the
process
great
superficial
tensions
would
be
produced
which
could
only
be
relieved
by
cracks
or
fissures
which
would
initiate
at
points
of
weakness
probably
at
the
craterlets
already
referred
to
from
which
they
would
radiate
in
several
directions
each
crack
thus
formed
near
the
surface
would
as
cooling
progressed
develop
in
length
and
depth
and
owing
to
the
general
uniformity
of
the
material
and
possibly
some
amount
of
crystalline
structure
due
to
slow
and
continuous
cooling
down
to
a
very
low
temperature
the
cracks
would
tend
to
run
on
in
straight
lines
and
to
extend
vertically
downwards
which
two
circumstances
would
necessarily
result
in
their
forming
portions
of
circles
on
the
planet
surface
the
two
great
facts
which
lowell
appeals
to
as
being
especially
of
basaltic
we
have
however
one
quite
natural
fact
on
our
earth
which
serves
to
illustrate
one
of
these
two
features
the
direction
of
the
downward
fissure
this
is
the
comparatively
common
phenomenon
of
basaltic
columns
and
causeways
the
wonderful
regularity
of
these
and
especially
the
not
unfrequent
upright
pillars
in
serried
ranks
as
in
the
palisades
of
the
hudson
river
must
have
always
impressed
observers
with
their
appearance
of
artificiality
yet
they
are
undoubtedly
the
result
of
the
very
slow
cooling
and
contraction
of
melted
rocks
under
compression
by
strata
and
above
so
that
when
once
solidified
the
mass
was
held
in
position
and
the
tension
produced
by
contraction
could
only
be
relieved
by
numerous
very
small
cracks
at
short
distances
from
each
other
in
every
direction
resulting
in
five
six
or
polygons
with
sides
only
a
few
inches
long
this
contraction
began
of
course
at
the
coolest
surface
generally
the
upper
one
and
observation
of
these
columns
in
various
positions
has
established
the
rule
that
their
direction
lengthways
always
at
right
angles
to
the
cooling
and
thus
whenever
this
surface
was
horizontal
the
columns
became
almost
exactly
vertical
this
applies
to
one
of
the
features
of
the
surface
of
mars
that
lowell
describes
with
much
confidence
is
that
it
is
wonderfully
uniform
and
level
which
of
course
it
would
be
if
it
had
once
been
in
a
liquid
or
plastic
state
and
not
much
disturbed
since
by
volcanic
or
other
internal
movements
the
result
would
be
that
cracks
formed
by
contraction
of
the
hardened
outer
crust
would
be
vertical
and
in
a
generally
uniform
material
at
a
very
uniform
temperature
these
cracks
would
continue
almost
indefinitely
in
straight
lines
the
hardened
and
contracting
surface
being
free
to
move
laterally
on
account
of
there
being
a
more
heated
and
plastic
layer
below
it
the
cracks
once
initiated
above
would
continually
widen
at
the
surface
as
they
penetrated
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
slightly
heated
substratum
now
as
basalt
begins
to
soften
at
about
and
the
surface
of
mars
has
cooled
to
at
least
the
perhaps
very
much
below
it
the
contraction
would
be
so
great
that
if
the
fissures
produced
were
miles
apart
they
might
be
three
miles
wide
at
the
surface
and
if
only
miles
apart
then
about
of
a
mile
wide
but
as
the
production
of
the
fissures
might
have
occupied
perhaps
millions
of
years
a
considerable
amount
of
atmospheric
denudation
would
result
however
slowly
it
acted
expansion
and
contraction
would
wear
away
the
edges
and
sides
of
the
fissures
fill
up
many
of
them
with
the
debris
and
widen
them
at
the
surfaces
to
perhaps
double
their
original
size

coefficient

contraction

basalt

pickering
observed
clouds
on
mars
miles
high
these
are
the
seen
on
the
terminator
when
the
planet
is
partially
illuminated
they
were
at
first
thought
to
be
mountains
but
during
the
opposition
of
more
than
of
them
were
seen
at
flagstaff
during
nine
months
observation
usually
they
are
of
rare
occurrence
they
are
seen
to
change
in
form
and
position
from
day
to
day
and
lowell
is
strongly
of
opinion
that
they
are
not
what
we
term
clouds
they
were
mostly
about
miles
high
indicating
considerable
aerial
disturbance
on
the
planet
and
therefore
capable
of
producing
proportional
surface
denudation
explanation
of
the
the
numerous
round
dots
seen
upon
the
and
especially
at
points
from
which
several
canals
radiate
and
where
they
intersect
termed
by
lowell
and
by
pickering
may
be
explained
in
two
ways
those
from
which
several
canals
radiate
may
be
true
craters
from
which
the
gases
imprisoned
in
the
heated
surface
layers
have
gradually
escaped
they
would
be
situated
at
points
of
weakness
in
the
crust
and
become
centres
from
which
cracks
would
start
during
contraction
those
dots
which
occur
at
the
crossing
of
two
straight
canals
or
cracks
may
have
originated
from
the
fact
that
at
such
intersections
there
would
be
four
angles
which
being
exposed
to
the
influence
of
alternate
heat
and
cold
during
day
and
night
on
the
two
opposite
surfaces
would
inevitably
in
time
become
fractured
and
crumbled
away
resulting
in
the
formation
of
a
roughly
circular
chasm
which
would
become
partly
filled
up
by
the
debris
those
formed
by
cracks
radiating
from
craterlets
would
also
be
subject
to
the
same
process
of
rounding
off
to
an
even
greater
extent
and
thus
would
be
produced
the
of
various
sizes
up
to
miles
or
more
in
diameter
recorded
by
lowell
and
other
observers
function
of
the
great
pickering
as
we
have
seen
supposes
that
these
fissures
give
out
the
gases
which
overflowing
on
each
side
favour
the
growth
of
the
supposed
vegetation
which
renders
the
course
of
the
canals
visible
and
this
no
doubt
may
have
been
the
case
during
the
remote
periods
when
these
cracks
gave
access
to
the
heated
portions
of
the
surface
layer
but
it
seems
more
probable
that
mars
has
now
cooled
down
to
the
almost
uniform
mean
temperature
it
derives
from
solar
heat
and
that
the
fissures
now
for
the
most
part
broad
shallow
valleys
serve
merely
as
channels
along
which
the
liquids
and
heavy
gases
derived
from
the
melting
of
the
polar
snows
naturally
flow
and
owing
to
their
nearly
level
surfaces
overflow
to
a
certain
distance
on
each
side
of
them
origin
of
the
blue
these
heavy
gases
mainly
perhaps
as
has
been
often
suggested
would
when
in
large
quantity
and
of
considerable
depth
reflect
a
good
deal
of
light
and
being
almost
inevitably
might
produce
that
blue
tinge
adjacent
to
the
melting
which
lowell
has
erroneously
assumed
to
be
itself
a
proof
of
the
presence
of
liquid
water
just
as
the
blue
of
our
sky
is
undoubtedly
due
to
reflection
from
the
dust
particles
in
our
higher
atmosphere
similar
particles
brought
down
by
the
from
the
higher
martian
atmosphere
might
produce
the
blue
tinge
in
the
great
volumes
of
heavy
gas
produced
by
its
evaporation
or
liquefaction
it
may
be
noted
that
lowell
objects
to
the
theory
of
the
formation
of
the
that
this
gas
at
low
pressures
does
not
liquefy
but
passes
at
once
from
the
solid
to
the
gaseous
state
and
that
only
water
remains
liquid
sufficiently
long
to
produce
the
blue
colour
which
plays
so
large
a
part
in
his
argument
for
the
mild
climate
essential
for
an
inhabited
planet
but
this
argument
as
i
have
already
shown
is
valueless
for
only
very
deep
water
can
possibly
show
a
blue
colour
by
reflected
light
while
a
atmosphere
especially
with
a
layer
of
very
dense
gas
at
the
bottom
of
it
as
would
be
the
case
with
the
newly
evaporated
from
the
diminishing
would
provide
the
very
conditions
likely
to
produce
this
blue
tinge
of
colour
it
may
be
considered
a
support
to
this
view
that
gas
becomes
liquid
at
and
solid
at
temperatures
far
higher
than
we
should
expect
to
prevail
in
the
polar
and
north
temperate
regions
of
mars
during
a
considerable
part
of
the
year
but
such
as
might
be
reached
there
during
the
summer
solstice
when
the
so
rapidly
disappear
to
be
a
few
months
later
double
the
curious
phenomena
of
the
canals
are
undoubtedly
the
most
difficult
to
explain
satisfactorily
on
any
theory
that
has
yet
been
suggested
they
vary
in
distance
apart
from
about
to
miles
in
many
cases
they
appear
perfectly
parallel
and
lowell
gives
us
the
impression
that
they
are
almost
always
so
but
his
maps
show
in
some
cases
decided
differences
of
width
at
the
two
extremities
indicating
considerable
want
of
parallelism
a
few
of
the
curved
canals
are
also
double
there
is
one
drawing
in
lowell
book
of
the
mouths
or
starting
points
of
the
euphrates
and
phison
two
widely
separated
double
canals
diverging
at
an
angle
of
about
from
the
same
two
oases
so
that
the
two
inner
canals
cross
each
other
now
this
suggests
two
wide
bands
of
weakness
in
the
planet
crust
radiating
probably
from
within
the
dark
tract
called
the
icarium
and
that
some
widespread
volcanic
outburst
initiated
diverging
cracks
on
either
side
of
these
bands
something
of
this
kind
may
have
been
the
cause
of
most
of
the
double
canals
or
they
may
have
been
started
from
two
or
more
craterlets
not
far
apart
the
direction
being
at
first
decided
by
some
local
peculiarity
of
structure
and
where
begun
continuing
in
straight
lines
owing
to
homogeneity
or
uniform
density
of
material
this
is
very
vague
but
the
phenomena
are
so
remarkable
and
so
very
imperfectly
known
at
present
that
nothing
but
suggestion
can
be
attempted
remarks
on
the
in
this
somewhat
detailed
exposition
of
a
possible
and
i
hope
a
probable
explanation
of
the
of
mars
i
have
endeavoured
to
be
guided
by
known
facts
or
accepted
theories
both
astronomical
and
geological
i
think
i
may
claim
to
have
shown
that
there
are
some
analogous
features
of
terrestrial
to
serve
as
guides
towards
a
natural
and
intelligible
explanation
of
the
strange
geometric
markings
discovered
during
the
last
thirty
years
and
which
have
raised
this
planet
from
comparative
obscurity
into
a
position
of
the
very
first
rank
both
in
astronomical
and
popular
interest
this
interest
is
very
largely
due
to
lowell
devotion
to
its
study
both
in
seeking
out
so
admirable
a
position
as
regards
altitude
and
climate
and
in
establishing
there
a
observatory
and
also
in
bringing
his
discoveries
before
the
public
in
connection
with
a
theory
so
startling
as
to
compel
attention
i
venture
to
think
that
his
merit
as
one
of
our
first
astronomical
observers
will
in
no
way
be
diminished
by
the
rejection
of
his
theory
and
the
substitution
of
one
more
in
accordance
with
the
actually
observed
facts
appendix
suggested
experiment
to
illustrate
the
of
if
my
explanation
of
the
should
be
substantially
correct
that
is
if
they
were
produced
by
the
contraction
of
a
heated
outward
crust
upon
a
cold
and
therefore
interior
the
result
of
such
a
condition
might
be
shown
experimentally
several
baked
clay
balls
might
be
formed
to
serve
as
cores
say
of
to
inches
in
diameter
these
being
fixed
within
moulds
of
say
half
an
inch
to
an
inch
greater
diameter
the
outer
layer
would
be
formed
by
pouring
in
some
suitable
heated
liquid
material
and
releasing
it
from
the
mould
as
soon
as
consolidation
occurs
so
that
it
may
cool
rapidly
from
the
some
kinds
of
impure
glass
or
the
brittle
metals
bismuth
or
antimony
or
alloys
of
these
might
be
used
in
order
to
see
what
form
the
resulting
fractures
would
take
it
would
be
well
to
have
several
duplicates
of
each
ball
and
as
soon
as
tension
through
contraction
manifests
itself
to
try
the
effect
of
firing
very
small
charges
of
small
shot
to
ascertain
whether
such
impacts
would
start
radiating
fractures
when
taken
from
the
moulds
the
balls
should
be
suspended
in
a
slight
current
of
air
and
kept
rotating
to
reproduce
the
planetary
condition
as
nearly
as
possible
the
exact
size
and
material
of
the
cores
the
thickness
of
the
heated
outer
crust
the
material
best
suited
to
show
fracture
by
contraction
and
the
details
of
their
treatment
might
be
modified
in
various
ways
as
suggested
by
the
results
first
obtained
such
a
series
of
experiments
would
probably
throw
further
light
on
the
physical
conditions
which
have
produced
the
gigantic
system
of
fissures
or
channels
we
see
upon
the
surface
of
mars
though
it
would
not
of
course
prove
that
such
conditions
actually
existed
there
in
such
a
speculative
matter
we
can
only
be
guided
by
probabilities
based
upon
whatever
evidence
is
available
chapter
viii
summary
and
conclusion
this
little
volume
has
necessarily
touched
upon
a
great
variety
of
subjects
in
order
to
deal
in
a
tolerably
complete
manner
with
the
very
extraordinary
theories
by
which
lowell
attempts
to
explain
the
unique
features
of
the
surface
of
the
planet
which
by
study
he
has
almost
made
his
own
it
may
therefore
be
well
to
sum
up
the
main
points
of
the
arguments
against
his
view
introducing
a
few
other
facts
and
considerations
which
greatly
strengthen
my
argument
the
one
great
feature
of
mars
which
led
lowell
to
adopt
the
view
of
its
being
inhabited
by
a
race
of
highly
intelligent
beings
and
with
discovery
to
uphold
this
theory
to
the
present
time
is
undoubtedly
that
of
the
their
straightness
their
enormous
length
their
great
abundance
and
their
extension
over
the
planet
whole
surface
from
one
polar
to
the
other
the
very
immensity
of
this
system
and
its
constant
growth
and
extension
during
fifteen
years
of
persistent
observation
have
so
completely
taken
possession
of
his
mind
that
after
a
very
hasty
glance
at
analogous
facts
and
possibilities
he
has
declared
them
to
be
therefore
to
be
works
of
art
therefore
to
necessitate
the
presence
of
highly
intelligent
beings
who
have
designed
and
constructed
them
this
idea
has
coloured
or
governed
all
his
writings
on
the
subject
the
innumerable
difficulties
which
it
raises
have
been
either
ignored
or
brushed
aside
on
the
flimsiest
evidence
as
examples
he
never
even
discusses
the
totally
inadequate
for
such
worldwide
irrigation
or
the
extreme
irrationality
of
constructing
so
vast
a
the
waste
from
which
by
evaporation
when
exposed
to
such
desert
conditions
as
he
himself
describes
would
use
up
ten
times
the
probable
supply
again
he
urges
the
displayed
in
these
their
being
so
straight
describing
great
circles
of
the
all
being
so
evidently
arranged
as
he
thinks
either
to
carry
water
to
some
miles
away
or
to
reach
some
arid
region
far
over
the
equator
in
the
opposite
hemisphere
but
he
never
considers
the
difficulties
this
implies
everywhere
these
canals
run
for
thousands
of
miles
across
waterless
deserts
forming
a
system
and
indicating
a
purpose
the
wonderful
perfection
of
which
he
is
never
tired
of
dwelling
upon
but
which
i
myself
can
nowhere
perceive
yet
he
never
even
attempts
to
explain
how
the
martians
could
have
lived
this
great
system
was
planned
and
executed
or
why
they
did
not
utilise
and
render
fertile
the
belt
of
land
adjacent
to
the
limits
of
the
polar
snows
why
the
method
of
irrigation
did
not
as
with
all
human
arts
begin
gradually
at
home
with
terraces
and
channels
to
irrigate
the
land
close
to
the
source
of
the
water
how
with
such
a
desert
as
he
describes
of
mars
to
be
did
the
inhabitants
ever
get
to
anything
of
the
equatorial
regions
and
its
needs
so
as
to
start
right
away
to
supply
those
needs
all
this
to
my
mind
is
quite
opposed
to
the
idea
of
their
being
works
of
art
and
altogether
in
favour
of
their
being
natural
features
of
a
globe
as
peculiar
in
origin
and
internal
structure
as
it
is
in
its
the
explanation
i
have
given
though
of
course
hypothetical
is
founded
on
known
cosmical
and
terrestrial
facts
and
is
i
suggest
far
more
scientific
as
well
as
more
satisfactory
than
lowell
wholly
unsupported
speculation
this
view
i
have
explained
in
some
detail
in
the
preceding
chapter
lowell
never
even
refers
to
the
important
question
of
loss
by
evaporation
in
these
enormous
open
canals
or
considers
the
undoubted
fact
that
the
only
intelligent
and
practical
way
to
convey
a
limited
quantity
of
water
such
great
distances
would
be
by
a
system
of
and
tubes
laid
the
the
mere
attempt
to
use
open
canals
for
such
a
purpose
shows
complete
ignorance
and
stupidity
in
these
alleged
very
superior
beings
while
it
is
certain
that
long
before
half
of
them
were
completed
their
failure
to
be
of
any
use
would
have
led
any
rational
beings
to
cease
constructing
them
he
also
fails
to
consider
the
difficulty
that
if
these
canals
are
necessary
for
existence
in
mars
how
did
the
inhabitants
ever
reach
a
sufficiently
large
population
with
surplus
food
and
leisure
enabling
them
to
rise
from
the
low
condition
of
savages
to
one
of
civilisation
and
ultimately
to
scientific
knowledge
here
again
is
a
dilemma
which
is
hard
to
overcome
only
a
population
with
means
of
subsistence
could
possibly
have
constructed
such
gigantic
works
but
given
these
two
conditions
no
adequate
motive
existed
for
the
conception
and
execution
of
them
even
if
they
were
likely
to
be
of
any
use
which
i
have
shown
they
could
not
be
considerations
on
the
climate
of
recurring
now
to
the
question
of
climate
which
is
lowell
never
even
discusses
the
essential
point
the
temperature
that
must
result
from
an
atmospheric
envelope
or
at
most
the
density
of
our
own
in
either
case
corresponding
to
an
altitude
far
greater
than
that
of
our
highest
mountains
surely
this
phenomenon
everywhere
manifested
on
the
earth
even
under
the
equator
of
a
regular
decrease
of
temperature
with
altitude
the
only
cause
of
which
is
a
less
dense
atmosphere
should
have
been
fairly
grappled
with
and
some
attempt
made
to
show
why
it
should
not
apply
to
mars
except
the
weak
remark
that
on
a
level
surface
it
will
not
have
the
same
effect
as
on
exposed
mountain
heights
but
it
have
the
same
effect
or
very
nearly
so
on
our
lofty
plateaux
often
hundreds
of
miles
in
extent
in
proportion
to
their
altitude
quito
at
above
the
sea
has
a
mean
temperature
of
about
giving
a
lowering
of
from
that
of
manaos
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
this
is
about
a
degree
for
each
feet
while
the
general
fall
for
isolated
mountains
is
about
one
degree
in
feet
according
to
humboldt
who
notes
the
above
difference
between
the
rate
of
cooling
for
altitude
of
the
plains
or
more
usually
sheltered
valleys
in
which
the
towns
are
situated
and
the
exposed
mountain
sides
it
will
be
seen
that
this
lower
rate
would
bring
the
temperature
of
mars
at
the
equator
down
to
below
the
freezing
point
of
water
from
this
cause
alone
footnote
a
four
inches
barometer
is
equivalent
to
a
height
of
feet
above
with
us
but
all
enquirers
have
admitted
that
if
conditions
as
to
atmosphere
were
the
same
as
on
the
earth
its
greater
distance
from
the
sun
would
reduce
the
temperature
equal
to
below
the
freezing
point
it
is
therefore
certain
that
the
combined
effect
of
both
causes
must
bring
the
temperature
of
mars
down
to
at
least
or
the
freezing
point
the
cause
of
this
absolute
dependence
of
terrestrial
temperatures
upon
density
of
the
is
seldom
discussed
in
either
of
geography
or
of
physics
and
there
seems
to
be
still
some
uncertainty
about
it
some
impute
it
wholly
to
the
thinner
air
being
unable
to
absorb
and
retain
so
much
heat
as
that
which
is
more
dense
but
if
this
were
the
case
the
soil
at
great
altitudes
not
having
so
much
of
its
heat
taken
up
by
the
air
should
be
warmer
than
below
since
it
undoubtedly
more
heat
owing
to
the
greater
transparency
of
the
air
above
it
but
it
certainly
does
not
become
warmer
the
more
correct
view
seems
to
be
that
the
loss
of
heat
by
radiation
is
increased
so
much
through
the
rarity
of
the
air
above
it
as
to
than
counterbalance
the
increased
insolation
so
that
though
the
surface
of
the
earth
at
a
given
altitude
may
receive
per
cent
more
direct
it
loses
by
direct
radiation
combined
with
diminished
air
and
perhaps
or
per
cent
more
whence
there
is
a
resultant
cooling
effect
of
or
per
cent
this
acts
by
day
as
well
as
by
night
so
that
the
greater
heat
received
at
high
altitudes
does
not
warm
the
soil
so
much
as
a
less
amount
of
heat
with
a
denser
atmosphere
this
effect
is
further
intensified
by
the
fact
that
a
less
dense
can
not
absorb
and
transmit
so
much
heat
as
a
more
dense
atmosphere
here
then
we
have
an
absolute
law
of
nature
to
be
observed
operating
everywhere
on
the
earth
and
the
mode
of
action
of
which
is
fairly
well
understood
this
law
is
that
reduced
atmospheric
pressure
increases
radiation
or
loss
of
heat
than
it
increases
insolation
or
gain
of
heat
so
that
the
result
is
a
considerable
of
temperature
what
this
lowering
is
can
be
seen
in
the
universal
fact
that
even
within
the
tropics
perpetual
snow
covers
the
higher
mountain
summits
while
on
the
high
plains
of
the
andes
at
or
feet
altitude
where
there
is
very
little
or
no
snow
travellers
are
often
frozen
to
death
when
delayed
by
storms
yet
at
this
elevation
the
atmosphere
has
much
more
than
double
the
density
of
that
of
mars
the
error
in
lowell
argument
is
that
he
claims
for
the
scanty
atmosphere
of
mars
that
it
allows
more
to
reach
the
surface
but
he
omits
to
take
account
of
the
enormously
increased
loss
of
heat
by
direct
radiation
as
well
as
by
the
diminution
of
which
together
necessarily
produce
a
great
reduction
of
temperature
it
is
this
great
principle
of
the
prepotency
of
radiation
over
absorption
with
a
diminishing
atmosphere
that
explains
the
excessively
low
temperature
of
the
moon
surface
a
fact
which
also
serves
to
indicate
a
very
low
temperature
for
mars
as
i
have
shown
in
chapter
vi
these
two
independent
arguments
from
alpine
temperatures
and
from
those
of
the
moon
support
and
enforce
each
other
and
afford
a
conclusive
proof
as
against
anything
advanced
by
lowell
that
the
temperature
of
mars
must
be
far
too
low
to
support
animal
life
a
third
independent
argument
leading
to
the
same
result
is
johnstone
stoney
proof
that
aqueous
vapour
can
not
exist
on
mars
and
this
fact
lowell
does
not
attempt
to
controvert
to
put
the
whole
case
in
the
fewest
possible
words
all
physicists
are
agreed
that
owing
to
the
distance
of
mars
from
the
sun
it
would
have
a
mean
temperature
of
f
abs
even
if
it
had
an
atmosphere
as
dense
as
ours
but
the
very
low
temperatures
on
the
earth
under
the
equator
at
a
height
where
the
barometer
stands
at
about
three
times
as
high
as
on
mars
proves
that
from
scantiness
of
atmosphere
alone
mars
can
not
possibly
have
a
temperature
as
high
as
the
freezing
point
of
water
and
this
proof
is
supported
by
langley
determination
of
the
low
temperature
of
the
full
moon
the
combination
of
these
two
results
must
bring
down
the
temperature
of
mars
to
a
degree
wholly
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
animal
life
the
quite
independent
proof
that
can
not
exist
on
mars
and
that
therefore
the
first
essential
of
organic
life
water
is
the
conclusion
from
these
three
independent
proofs
which
enforce
each
other
in
the
multiple
ratio
of
their
respective
weights
is
therefore
irresistible
that
animal
life
especially
in
its
higher
forms
can
not
exist
on
the
planet
mars
therefore
is
not
only
uninhabited
by
intelligent
beings
such
as
lowell
postulates
but
is
absolutely
uninhabitable
