hunca
munca
tried
every
tin
spoon
in
turn
the

then
tom
thumb
lost
his
temper
he
put
the
ham
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
hit
it
with
the
tongs
and
with
the
shovel
bang

the
ham
flew
all
into
pieces
for
underneath
the
shiny
paint
it
was
made

nothing
but
plaster
then
there
was
no
end
to
the
rage
and
disappointment
of
tom
thumb
and
hunca
munca
they
broke
up
the
pudding
the
lobsters
the
pears

the
oranges
as
the
fish
would
not
come
off

crinkly
paper
fire
in
the

but
it
would
not
burn
either
illustration

tom
thumb
went
up
the
kitchen
chimney
and
looked
out
at
the
top
there
was
no
soot
while
tom

was
up
the
chimney
hunca
munca
had
another
disappointment
she
found
some
tiny
canisters
upon
the
dresser
labelled
rice
coffee
sago
but
when
she
turned
them
upside
down
there
was
nothing
inside
except
red
and
blue
beads
illustration

then
those
mice
set
to
work
to
do
all
the
mischief
they
could
especially
tom
thumb
he
took
jane
clothes
out
of
the
chest
of
drawers
in
her
bedroom
and
he
threw
them
out
of
the
top
floor
window
but
hunca
munca
had
a
frugal
mind
after
pulling
half
the
feathers
out
of
lucinda
bolster
she
remembered
that
she
herself
was
in
want
of
a
feather
bed
with
tom
thumb
assistance
she
carried
the
bolster
downstairs
and
across
the
it
was
difficult
to
squeeze
the
bolster
into
the
but
they
managed
it
somehow

rushed
back
to
their
hole
and
the

upon
