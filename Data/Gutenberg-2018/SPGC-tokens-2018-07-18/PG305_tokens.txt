translated
from
the
french
a
novel

two
parts

of
this
novel
is
found
in
the
volume
baron

s
vengeance
pascal
and
marguerite
i
it
was
a
thursday
evening
the
fifteenth
of
october
and
although
only
six
o
clock
it
had
been
dark
for
some
time
already
the
weather
was
cold
and
the
sky
was
as
black
as
ink
while
the
wind
blew
tempestuously
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
the
servants
at
the
hotel
de
chalusse
one
of
the
most
magnificent
mansions
in
the
rue
de
courcelles
in
paris
were
assembled
in
the
porter
s
lodge
a
little
building
comprising
a
couple
of
rooms
standing
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
great
gateway
here
as
in
all
large
mansions
the
concierge
or
porter
bourigeau
was
a
person
of
immense
importance
always
able
and
disposed
to
make
any
one
who
was
inclined
to
doubt
his
authority
feel
it
in
cruel
fashion
as
could
be
easily
seen
he
held
all
the
other
servants
in
his
power
he
could
let
them
absent
themselves
without
leave
if
he
chose
and
conceal
all
returns
late
at
night
after
the
closing
of
public
balls
and
thus
it
is
needless
to
say
that
bourigeau
and
his
wife
were
treated
by
their
with
the
most
servile
adulation
the
owner
of
the
house
was
not
at
home
that
evening
so
that
casimir
the
count
s
head
valet
was
serving
coffee
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
retainers
and
while
the
company
sipped
the
fragrant
beverage
which
had
been
generously
tinctured
with
cognac
provided
by
the
butler
they
all
united
in
abusing
their
common
enemy
the
master
of
the
house
for
the
time
being
a
pert
little
with
an
odious
nose
had
the
floor
she
was
addressing
her
remarks
to
a
big
burly
and
rather
fellow
who
had
been
added
only
the
evening
before
to
the
corps
of
footmen
the
place
is
really
intolerable
she
was
saying
the
wages
are
high
the
food
of
the
very
best
the
livery
just
such
as
would
show
off
a
man
to
the
best
advantage
and
madame
leon
the
housekeeper
who
has
entire
charge
of
everything
is
not
too
and
the
work
a
mere
nothing
think
there
are
eighteen
of
us
to
serve
only
two
persons
the
count
and
mademoiselle
marguerite
but
then
there
is
never
any
pleasure
never
any
amusement
what
is
one
bored
then
bored
to
death
this
grand
house
is
worse
than
a
tomb
no
receptions
no
dinners
nothing
would
you
believe
it
i
have
never
seen
the
they
are
always
closed
and
the
furniture
is
dropping
to
pieces
under
its
coverings
there
are
not
three
visitors
in
the
course
of
a
she
was
evidently
incensed
and
the
new
footman
seemed
to
share
her
indignation
why
how
is
it
he
exclaimed
is
the
count
an
owl
a
man
who
s
not
yet
fifty
years
old
and
who
s
said
to
be
worth
several
yes
millions
you
may
safely
say
it
and
perhaps
ten
perhaps
twenty
millions
then
all
the
more
reason
why
there
should
be
something
going
on
here
what
does
he
do
with
himself
alone
all
the
blessed
day
nothing
he
reads
in
the
library
or
wanders
about
the
garden
sometimes
in
the
evening
he
drives
with
mademoiselle
marguerite
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
in
a
closed
carriage
but
that
seldom
happens
besides
there
is
no
such
thing
as
teasing
the
poor
man
i
ve
been
in
the
house
for
six
months
and
i
ve
never
heard
him
say
anything
but
yes
no
do
this
very
well
you
would
think
these
are
the
only
words
he
knows
ask
casimir
if
i
m
not
our
guv
nor
isn
t
very
gay
that
s
a
fact
responded
the
valet
the
footman
was
listening
with
a
serious
air
as
if
greatly
interested
in
the
character
of
the
people
whom
he
was
to
serve
and
mademoiselle
he
asked
what
does
she
say
to
such
an
existence
bless
me
during
the
six
months
she
has
been
here
she
has
never
once
if
she
is
bored
added
casimir
she
conceals
it
naturally
enough
sneered
the
with
an
ironical
gesture
each
month
that
mademoiselle
remains
here
brings
her
too
much
money
for
her
to
by
the
laugh
that
greeted
this
reply
and
by
the
looks
the
older
servants
exchanged
the
must
have
realized
that
he
had
discovered
the
secret
skeleton
hidden
in
every
house
what
what
he
exclaimed
on
fire
with
curiosity
is
there
really
anything
in
that
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
inclined
to
doubt
his
companions
were
evidently
about
to
tell
him
all
they
knew
or
rather
all
they
thought
they
knew
when
the
bell
rang
vigorously
there
he
comes
exclaimed
the
concierge
but
he
s
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
hell
have
to
wait
he
sullenly
pulled
the
cord
however
the
heavy
door
swayed
on
its
hinges
and
a
breathless
and
hatless
burst
into
the
room
crying
help
help
the
servants
sprang
to
their
feet
make
haste
continued
the
driver
i
was
bringing
a
gentleman
here
you
must
know
him
he
s
outside
in
my
vehicle
without
pausing
to
listen
any
longer
the
servants
rushed
out
and
the
driver
s
incoherent
explanation
at
once
became
intelligible
at
the
bottom
of
the
cab
a
roomy
a
man
was
lying
all
of
a
heap
speechless
and
motionless
he
must
have
fallen
forward
face
downward
and
owing
to
the
jolting
of
the
vehicle
his
head
had
slipped
under
the
front
seat
poor
devil
muttered
casimir
he
must
have
had
a
stroke
of
the
valet
was
peering
into
the
vehicle
as
he
spoke
and
his
comrades
were
approaching
when
suddenly
he
drew
back
uttering
a
cry
of
horror
ah
my
god
it
is
the
count
whenever
there
is
an
accident
in
paris
a
throng
of
inquisitive
spectators
seems
to
spring
up
from
the
very
pavement
and
indeed
more
than
fifty
persons
had
already
congregated
round
about
the
vehicle
this
circumstance
restored
casimir
s
composure
or
at
least
some
portion
of
it
you
must
drive
into
the
courtyard
he
said
addressing
the
cabman
m
bourigeau
open
the
gate
if
you
and
then
turning
to
another
servant
he
added
and
you
must
make
haste
and
fetch
a
physician
no
matter
who
run
to
the
nearest
doctor
and
don
t
return
until
you
bring
one
with
the
concierge
had
opened
the
gate
but
the
driver
had
disappeared
they
called
him
and
on
receiving
no
reply
the
valet
seized
the
reins
and
skilfully
guided
the
cab
through
the
gateway
having
escaped
the
scrutiny
of
the
crowd
it
now
remained
to
remove
the
count
from
the
vehicle
and
this
was
a
difficult
task
on
account
of
the
singular
position
of
his
body
still
they
succeeded
at
last
by
opening
both
doors
of
the
cab
the
three
strongest
men
uniting
in
their
efforts
then
they
placed
him
in
a
large
carried
him
to
his
own
room
and
speedily
had
him
undressed
and
in
bed
he
had
so
far
given
no
sign
of
life
and
as
he
lay
there
with
his
head
weighing
heavily
on
the
pillow
you
might
have
thought
that
all
was
over
his
most
intimate
friend
would
scarcely
have
recognized
him
his
features
were
swollen
and
discolored
his
eyes
were
closed
and
a
dark
purple
circle
looking
almost
like
a
terrible
bruise
extended
round
them
a
spasm
had
twisted
his
lips
and
his
distorted
mouth
which
was
drawn
on
one
side
and
hung
half
open
imparted
a
most
sinister
expression
to
his
face
in
spite
of
every
precaution
he
had
been
wounded
as
he
was
removed
from
the
cab
his
forehead
had
been
grazed
by
a
piece
of
iron
and
a
tiny
stream
of
blood
was
trickling
down
upon
his
face
however
he
still
breathed
and
by
listening
attentively
one
could
distinguish
a
faint
rattling
in
his
throat
the
servants
who
had
been
so
garrulous
a
few
moments
before
were
silent
now
they
lingered
in
the
room
exchanging
glances
of
mute
consternation
their
faces
were
pale
and
sad
and
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
some
of
them
what
was
passing
in
their
minds
perhaps
they
were
overcome
by
that
unconquerable
fear
which
sudden
and
unexpected
death
always
provokes
perhaps
they
unconsciously
loved
this
master
whose
bread
they
ate
perhaps
their
grief
was
only
selfishness
and
they
were
merely
wondering
what
would
become
of
them
where
they
should
find
another
situation
and
if
it
would
prove
a
good
one
not
knowing
what
to
do
they
talked
together
in
subdued
voices
each
suggesting
some
remedy
he
had
heard
spoken
of
for
such
cases
the
more
sensible
among
them
were
proposing
to
go
and
inform
mademoiselle
or
madame
leon
whose
rooms
were
on
the
floor
above
when
the
rustling
of
a
skirt
against
the
door
suddenly
made
them
turn
the
person
whom
they
called
mademoiselle
was
standing
on
the
threshold
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
a
beautiful
young
girl
about
twenty
years
of
age
she
was
a
brunette
of
medium
height
with
big
gloomy
eyes
shaded
by
thick
eyebrows
heavy
masses
of
hair
wreathed
her
lofty
but
rather
sad
and
thoughtful
forehead
there
was
something
peculiar
in
her
face
an
expression
of
concentrated
suffering
and
a
sort
of
proud
resignation
mingled
with
timidity
what
has
happened
she
asked
gently
what
is
the
cause
of
all
the
noise
i
have
heard
i
have
rung
three
times
and
the
bell
was
not
no
one
ventured
to
reply
and
in
her
surprise
she
cast
a
hasty
glance
around
from
where
she
stood
she
could
not
see
the
bed
stationed
in
an
alcove
but
she
instantly
noted
the
dejected
attitude
of
the
servants
the
clothing
scattered
about
the
floor
and
the
disorder
that
pervaded
this
magnificent
but
severely
furnished
chamber
which
was
only
lighted
by
the
lamp
which
bourigeau
the
concierge
carried
a
sudden
dread
seized
her
she
shuddered
and
in
a
faltering
voice
she
added
why
are
you
all
here
speak
tell
me
what
has
casimir
stepped
forward
a
great
misfortune
mademoiselle
a
terrible
misfortune
the
count
and
he
paused
frightened
by
what
he
was
about
to
say
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
understood
him
she
clasped
both
hands
to
her
heart
as
if
she
had
received
a
fatal
wound
and
uttered
the
single
word
lost
the
next
moment
she
turned
as
pale
as
death
her
head
drooped
her
eyes
closed
and
she
staggered
as
if
about
to
fall
two
maids
sprang
forward
to
support
her
but
she
gently
repulsed
them
murmuring
thanks
thanks
i
am
strong
she
was
in
fact
sufficiently
strong
to
conquer
her
weakness
she
summoned
all
her
resolution
and
paler
than
a
statue
with
set
teeth
and
dry
glittering
eyes
she
approached
the
alcove
she
stood
there
for
a
moment
perfectly
motionless
murmuring
a
few
unintelligible
words
but
at
last
crushed
by
her
sorrow
she
sank
upon
her
knees
beside
the
bed
buried
her
face
in
the
counterpane
and
wept
deeply
moved
by
the
sight
of
this
despair
the
servants
held
their
breath
wondering
how
it
would
all
end
it
ended
suddenly
the
girl
sprang
from
her
knees
as
if
a
gleam
of
hope
had
darted
through
her
heart
a
physician
she
said
eagerly
i
have
sent
for
one
mademoiselle
replied
casimir
and
hearing
a
voice
and
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
staircase
he
added
and
fortunately
here
he
the
doctor
entered
he
was
a
young
man
although
his
head
was
almost
quite
bald
he
was
short
very
thin
and
clad
in
black
from
head
to
foot
without
a
word
without
a
bow
he
walked
straight
to
the
bedside
lifted
the
unconscious
man
s
eyelids
felt
his
pulse
and
uncovered
his
chest
applying
his
ear
to
it
this
is
a
serious
case
he
said
at
the
close
of
his
examination
mademoiselle
marguerite
who
had
followed
his
movements
with
the
most
poignant
anxiety
could
not
repress
a
sob
but
all
hope
is
not
lost
is
it
monsieur
she
asked
in
a
beseeching
voice
with
hands
clasped
in
passionate
entreaty
you
will
save
him
will
you
not
you
will
save
him
one
may
always
hope
for
the
this
was
the
doctor
s
only
answer
he
had
drawn
his
case
of
instruments
from
his
pocket
and
was
testing
the
points
of
his
lancets
on
the
tip
of
his
finger
when
he
had
found
one
to
his
liking
i
must
ask
you
mademoiselle
said
he
to
order
these
women
to
retire
and
to
retire
yourself
the
men
will
remain
to
assist
me
if
i
require
she
obeyed
submissively
but
instead
of
returning
to
her
own
room
she
remained
in
the
hall
seating
herself
upon
the
lower
step
of
the
staircase
near
the
door
counting
the
seconds
and
drawing
a
thousand
conjectures
from
the
slightest
sound
meanwhile
inside
the
room
the
physician
was
proceeding
slowly
not
from
temperament
however
but
from
principle
jodon
for
such
was
his
name
was
an
ambitious
man
who
played
a
part
educated
by
a
prince
of
science
more
celebrated
for
the
money
he
gained
than
for
the
cures
he
effected
he
copied
his
master
s
method
his
gestures
and
even
the
inflections
of
his
voice
by
casting
in
people
s
eyes
the
same
powder
as
his
teacher
had
employed
he
hoped
to
obtain
the
same
results
a
large
practice
and
an
immense
fortune
in
his
secret
heart
he
was
by
no
means
disconcerted
by
his
patient
s
condition
on
the
contrary
he
did
not
consider
the
count
s
state
nearly
as
precarious
as
it
really
was
but
bleeding
and
cupping
alike
failed
to
bring
the
sick
man
to
consciousness
he
remained
speechless
and
motionless
the
only
result
obtained
was
that
his
breathing
became
a
trifle
easier
finding
his
endeavors
fruitless
the
doctor
at
last
declared
that
all
immediate
remedies
were
exhausted
that
the
women
might
be
allowed
to
return
and
that
nothing
now
remained
but
to
wait
for
the
effect
of
the
remedies
he
was
about
to
prescribe
and
which
they
must
procure
from
the
nearest
chemist
any
other
man
would
have
been
touched
by
the
agony
of
entreaty
contained
in
the
glance
that
mademoiselle
marguerite
cast
upon
the
physician
as
she
returned
into
the
room
but
it
did
not
affect
him
in
the
least
he
calmly
said
i
can
not
give
my
decision
as
my
god
murmured
the
unhappy
girl
oh
my
god
have
mercy
upon
me
but
the
doctor
copying
his
model
had
stationed
himself
near
the
fireplace
with
his
elbow
leaning
on
the
in
a
graceful
though
rather
pompous
attitude
now
he
said
addressing
his
remarks
to
casimir
i
desire
to
make
a
few
inquiries
is
this
the
first
time
the
count
de
chalusse
has
had
such
an
attack
yes
sir
at
least
since
i
have
been
in
attendance
upon
very
good
that
is
a
chance
in
our
favor
tell
me
have
you
ever
heard
him
complain
of
vertigo
or
of
a
buzzing
in
his
ears
mademoiselle
marguerite
seemed
inclined
to
volunteer
some
remark
but
the
doctor
imposed
silence
upon
her
by
a
gesture
and
continued
his
examination
is
the
count
a
great
eater
he
inquired
does
he
drink
heavily
the
count
is
moderation
itself
monsieur
and
he
always
takes
a
great
deal
of
water
with
his
the
doctor
listened
with
an
air
of
intent
thoughtfulness
his
head
slightly
inclined
forward
his
brow
contracted
and
his
under
lip
puffed
out
while
from
time
to
time
he
stroked
his
beardless
chin
he
was
copying
his
master
the
devil
he
said
sotto
voce
there
must
be
some
cause
for
such
an
attack
however
nothing
in
the
count
s
constitution
predisposes
him
to
such
an
accident
then
suddenly
turning
toward
mademoiselle
marguerite
do
you
know
mademoiselle
whether
the
count
has
experienced
any
very
violent
emotion
during
the
past
few
days
something
occurred
this
very
morning
which
seemed
to
annoy
him
very
ah
now
we
have
it
said
the
doctor
with
the
air
of
an
oracle
why
did
you
not
tell
me
all
this
at
first
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
give
me
the
particulars
the
young
girl
hesitated
the
servants
were
dazed
by
the
doctor
s
manner
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
far
from
sharing
their
awe
and
admiration
she
would
have
given
anything
to
have
had
the
regular
physician
of
the
household
there
instead
of
him
as
for
this
coarse
examination
in
the
presence
of
all
these
servants
and
by
the
bedside
of
a
man
who
in
spite
of
his
apparent
unconsciousness
was
perhaps
able
to
hear
and
to
comprehend
she
looked
upon
it
as
a
breach
of
delicacy
even
of
propriety
it
is
of
the
most
urgent
importance
that
i
should
be
fully
informed
of
these
particulars
repeated
the
physician
peremptorily
after
such
an
assertion
further
hesitation
was
out
of
the
question
mademoiselle
marguerite
seemed
to
collect
her
thoughts
and
then
she
sadly
said
just
as
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
this
morning
a
letter
was
handed
to
the
count
no
sooner
had
his
eyes
fallen
upon
it
than
he
turned
as
white
as
his
napkin
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
began
to
walk
hastily
up
and
down
the
uttering
exclamations
of
anger
and
sorrow
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
me
however
after
a
few
moments
he
resumed
his
seat
at
the
table
and
began
to
eat
as
usual
he
ate
more
than
usual
monsieur
only
i
must
tell
you
that
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
four
or
five
times
he
left
the
table
and
then
came
back
again
at
last
after
quite
a
struggle
he
seemed
to
come
to
some
decision
he
tore
the
letter
to
pieces
and
threw
the
pieces
out
of
the
window
that
opens
upon
the
mademoiselle
marguerite
expressed
herself
with
the
utmost
simplicity
and
there
was
certainly
nothing
particularly
extraordinary
in
her
story
still
those
around
her
listened
with
breathless
curiosity
as
though
they
were
expecting
some
startling
revelation
so
much
does
the
human
mind
abhor
that
which
is
natural
and
incline
to
that
which
is
mysterious
without
seeming
to
notice
the
effect
she
had
produced
and
addressing
herself
to
the
physician
alone
the
girl
continued
after
the
letter
was
destroyed
de
chalusse
seemed
himself
again
coffee
was
served
and
he
afterward
lighted
a
cigar
as
usual
however
he
soon
let
it
go
out
i
dared
not
disturb
him
by
any
remarks
but
suddenly
he
said
to
me
it
s
strange
but
i
feel
very
a
moment
passed
without
either
of
us
speaking
and
then
he
added
i
am
certainly
not
well
will
you
do
me
the
favor
to
go
to
my
room
for
me
here
is
the
key
of
my
escritoire
open
it
and
on
the
upper
shelf
you
will
find
a
small
bottle
which
please
bring
to
i
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
de
chalusse
who
usually
speaks
very
distinctly
stammered
and
hesitated
considerably
in
making
this
request
but
unfortunately
i
did
not
think
much
about
it
at
the
time
i
did
as
he
requested
and
he
poured
eight
or
ten
drops
of
the
contents
of
the
vial
into
a
glass
of
water
and
swallowed
so
intense
was
jodon
s
interest
that
he
became
himself
again
he
forgot
to
attitudinize
and
after
that
he
asked
eagerly
after
that
de
chalusse
seemed
to
feel
much
better
and
retired
to
his
study
as
usual
i
fancied
that
any
annoyance
the
letter
had
caused
him
was
forgotten
but
i
was
wrong
for
in
the
afternoon
he
sent
a
message
through
madame
leon
requesting
me
to
join
him
in
the
garden
i
hastened
there
very
much
surprised
for
the
weather
was
extremely
disagreeable
dear
marguerite
he
said
on
seeing
me
help
me
to
find
the
fragments
of
that
letter
which
i
flung
from
the
window
this
morning
i
would
give
half
my
fortune
for
an
address
which
it
must
certainly
have
contained
but
which
i
quite
overlooked
in
my
i
helped
him
as
he
asked
he
might
have
reasonably
hoped
to
succeed
for
it
was
raining
when
the
scraps
of
paper
were
thrown
out
and
instead
of
flying
through
the
air
they
fell
directly
on
to
the
ground
we
succeeded
in
finding
a
large
number
of
the
scraps
but
what
de
chalusse
so
particularly
wanted
was
not
to
be
read
on
any
one
of
them
several
times
he
spoke
of
his
regret
and
cursed
his
bourigeau
the
concierge
and
casimir
exchanged
a
significant
smile
they
had
seen
the
count
searching
for
the
remnants
of
this
letter
and
had
thought
him
little
better
than
an
idiot
but
now
everything
was
explained
i
was
much
grieved
at
the
count
s
disappointment
continued
mademoiselle
marguerite
but
suddenly
he
exclaimed
joyfully
that
address
why
such
a
person
will
give
it
to
me
what
a
fool
i
am
the
physician
evinced
such
absorbing
interest
in
this
narrative
that
he
forgot
to
retain
his
usual
impassive
attitude
such
a
person
who
who
was
this
person
he
inquired
eagerly
without
apparently
realizing
the
impropriety
of
his
question
but
the
girl
felt
indignant
she
silenced
her
indiscreet
questioner
with
a
haughty
glance
and
in
the
driest
possible
tone
replied
i
have
forgotten
the
cut
to
the
quick
the
doctor
suddenly
resumed
his
master
s
pose
but
all
the
same
his
imperturbable
was
sensibly
impaired
believe
me
mademoiselle
that
interest
alone
a
most
respectful
interest
she
did
not
even
seem
to
hear
his
excuse
but
resumed
i
know
however
monsieur
that
de
chalusse
intended
applying
to
the
police
if
he
failed
to
obtain
this
address
from
the
person
in
question
after
this
he
appeared
to
be
entirely
at
ease
at
three
o
clock
he
rang
for
his
valet
and
ordered
dinner
two
hours
earlier
than
usual
we
sat
down
to
table
at
about
four
at
five
he
rose
kissed
me
gayly
and
left
the
house
on
foot
telling
me
that
he
was
confident
of
success
and
that
he
did
not
expect
to
return
before
the
poor
child
s
firmness
now
gave
way
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
it
was
in
a
voice
choked
with
sobs
that
she
added
pointing
to
de
chalusse
but
at
six
they
brought
him
back
as
you
see
him
now
an
interval
of
silence
ensued
so
deep
that
one
could
hear
the
faint
breathing
of
the
unconscious
man
still
lying
motionless
on
his
bed
however
the
particulars
of
the
attack
were
yet
to
be
learned
and
it
was
casimir
whom
the
physician
next
addressed
what
did
the
driver
who
brought
your
master
home
say
to
you
oh
almost
nothing
sir
not
ten
you
must
find
this
man
and
bring
him
to
two
servants
rushed
out
in
search
of
him
he
could
not
be
far
away
for
his
vehicle
was
still
standing
in
the
courtyard
they
found
him
in
a
near
by
some
of
the
inquisitive
spectators
who
had
been
disappointed
in
their
curiosity
by
casimir
s
thoughtfulness
had
treated
him
to
some
liquor
and
in
exchange
he
had
told
them
all
he
knew
about
the
affair
he
had
quite
recovered
from
his
fright
and
was
cheerful
even
gay
come
make
haste
you
are
wanted
said
the
servants
he
emptied
his
glass
and
followed
them
with
very
bad
grace
muttering
and
swearing
between
his
set
teeth
the
doctor
strange
to
say
was
considerate
enough
to
go
out
into
the
hall
to
question
him
but
no
information
of
value
was
gained
by
the
man
s
answers
he
declared
that
the
gentleman
had
hired
him
at
twelve
o
clock
hoping
by
this
means
to
extort
pay
for
five
hours
driving
which
joined
to
the
liberal
gratuity
he
could
not
fail
to
obtain
would
remunerate
him
handsomely
for
his
day
s
work
living
is
dear
it
should
be
remembered
and
a
fellow
makes
as
much
as
he
can
when
the
cabby
had
gone
off
still
growling
although
a
couple
of
louis
had
been
placed
in
his
hand
the
doctor
returned
to
his
patient
he
involuntarily
assumed
his
accustomed
attitude
with
crossed
arms
a
gloomy
expression
of
countenance
and
his
forehead
furrowed
as
if
with
thought
and
anxiety
but
this
time
he
was
not
acting
a
part
in
spite
or
rather
by
reason
of
the
full
explanation
that
had
been
given
him
he
found
something
suspicious
and
mysterious
in
the
whole
affair
a
thousand
vague
and
undefinable
suspicions
crossed
his
mind
was
he
in
presence
of
a
crime
certainly
evidently
not
but
what
was
the
cause
then
of
the
mystery
and
reticence
he
detected
was
he
upon
the
track
of
some
lamentable
family
secret
one
of
those
terrible
scandals
concealed
for
a
long
time
but
which
at
last
burst
forth
with
startling
effect
the
prospect
of
being
mixed
up
in
such
an
affair
caused
him
infinite
pleasure
it
would
bring
him
into
notice
he
would
be
mentioned
in
the
papers
and
his
increased
practice
would
fill
his
hands
with
gold
but
what
could
he
do
to
ingratiate
himself
with
these
people
impose
himself
upon
them
if
needs
be
he
reflected
for
some
time
and
finally
what
he
thought
an
excellent
plan
occurred
to
him
he
approached
mademoiselle
marguerite
who
was
weeping
in
an
and
touched
her
gently
on
the
shoulder
she
sprang
to
her
feet
at
once
one
more
question
mademoiselle
said
he
imparting
as
much
solemnity
to
his
tone
as
he
could
do
you
know
what
liquid
it
was
that
de
chalusse
took
this
morning
alas
no
it
is
very
important
that
i
should
know
the
accuracy
of
my
diagnosis
is
dependent
upon
it
what
has
become
of
the
vial
i
think
de
chalusse
replaced
it
in
his
the
physician
pointed
to
an
article
of
furniture
to
the
left
of
the
fireplace
there
he
asked
yes
he
deliberated
but
at
last
conquering
his
hesitation
he
said
could
we
not
obtain
this
vial
mademoiselle
marguerite
blushed
i
haven
t
the
key
she
faltered
in
evident
embarrassment
casimir
approached
it
must
be
in
the
count
s
pocket
and
if
mademoiselle
will
allow
me
but
she
stepped
back
with
outstretched
arms
as
if
to
protect
the
escritoire
no
she
exclaimed
no
the
escritoire
shall
not
be
touched
i
will
not
permit
it
but
mademoiselle
insisted
the
doctor
your
father
the
count
de
chalusse
is
not
my
father
jodon
was
greatly
disconcerted
by
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
vehemence
ah
said
he
in
three
different
tones
ah
ah
in
less
than
a
second
a
thousand
strange
and
contradictory
suppositions
darted
through
his
brain
who
then
could
this
girl
be
if
she
were
not
mademoiselle
de
chalusse
what
right
had
she
in
that
house
how
was
it
that
she
reigned
as
a
sovereign
there
above
all
why
this
angry
outburst
for
no
other
apparent
cause
than
a
very
natural
and
exceedingly
insignificant
request
on
his
part
however
she
had
regained
her
and
it
was
easy
to
see
by
her
manner
that
she
was
seeking
some
means
of
escape
from
threatened
danger
at
last
she
found
it
casimir
she
said
authoritatively
search
de
chalusse
s
pocket
for
the
key
of
his
astonished
by
what
he
regarded
as
a
new
caprice
the
valet
obeyed
he
gathered
up
the
garments
strewn
over
the
floor
and
eventually
drew
a
key
from
one
of
the
waistcoat
pockets
mademoiselle
marguerite
took
it
from
him
and
then
in
a
determined
tone
exclaimed
a
it
was
brought
whereupon
to
the
profound
amazement
of
the
physician
she
knelt
down
beside
the
fireplace
laid
the
key
upon
one
of
the
andirons
and
with
a
heavy
blow
of
the
hammer
broke
it
into
fragments
now
said
she
quietly
my
mind
will
be
at
rest
i
am
certain
she
added
turning
toward
the
servants
that
de
chalusse
would
approve
what
i
have
done
when
he
recovers
he
will
have
another
key
the
explanation
was
superfluous
all
the
servants
understood
the
motive
that
had
influenced
her
and
were
saying
to
themselves
mademoiselle
is
right
it
would
not
do
to
touch
the
escritoire
of
a
dying
man
who
knows
but
what
there
are
millions
in
it
if
anything
were
missed
why
any
of
us
might
be
accused
but
if
the
key
is
destroyed
it
will
be
impossible
to
suspect
any
however
the
physician
s
conjectures
were
of
an
entirely
different
nature
what
can
there
be
in
that
escritoire
which
she
desires
to
conceal
he
thought
but
there
was
no
excuse
for
prolonging
his
visit
once
more
he
examined
the
sick
man
whose
condition
remained
unchanged
and
then
after
explaining
what
was
to
be
done
in
his
absence
he
declared
that
he
must
leave
at
once
as
he
had
a
number
of
important
visits
to
make
he
added
however
that
he
would
return
about
midnight
madame
leon
and
i
will
watch
over
de
chalusse
replied
mademoiselle
marguerite
that
is
sufficient
assurance
monsieur
that
your
orders
will
be
obeyed
to
the
letter
only
you
will
not
take
offence
i
trust
if
i
ask
the
count
s
regular
physician
to
meet
you
in
such
a
proposal
was
anything
but
pleasing
to
jodon
who
had
met
with
the
same
misfortune
in
this
aristocratic
neighborhood
several
times
before
when
an
accident
happened
he
was
summoned
because
he
chanced
to
be
close
at
hand
but
just
as
he
was
flattering
himself
that
he
had
gained
a
desirable
patient
he
found
himself
in
presence
of
some
celebrated
physician
who
had
come
from
a
distance
in
his
carriage
accustomed
to
such
disappointments
he
knew
how
to
conceal
his
dissatisfaction
were
i
in
your
place
mademoiselle
i
should
do
precisely
what
you
suggest
he
answered
and
should
you
think
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
call
i
oh
monsieur
on
the
contrary
i
shall
certainly
expect
in
that
case
very
thereupon
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
followed
him
on
to
the
landing
you
know
monsieur
she
said
speaking
rapidly
in
an
undertone
that
i
am
not
de
chalusse
s
daughter
you
may
therefore
tell
me
the
truth
is
his
condition
hopeless
alarming
yes
hopeless
but
monsieur
this
terrible
unconsciousness
it
usually
follows
such
an
attack
as
he
has
been
the
victim
of
still
we
may
hope
that
the
paralysis
will
gradually
disappear
and
the
power
of
motion
return
after
a
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
listening
pale
agitated
and
embarrassed
it
was
evident
that
she
had
a
question
on
her
lips
which
she
scarcely
dared
to
ask
at
last
however
summoning
all
her
courage
she
exclaimed
and
if
de
chalusse
should
not
recover
will
he
die
without
regaining
consciousness
without
being
able
to
speak
i
am
unable
to
say
mademoiselle
the
count
s
malady
is
one
of
those
which
set
at
naught
all
the
hypotheses
of
she
thanked
him
sadly
sent
a
servant
to
summon
madame
leon
and
returned
to
the
count
s
room
as
for
the
doctor
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
downstairs
what
a
strange
girl
is
she
afraid
that
the
count
will
regain
consciousness
or
on
the
contrary
does
she
wish
him
to
speak
is
there
any
question
of
a
will
under
all
this
what
else
can
it
be
what
is
at
stake
his
preoccupation
was
so
intense
that
he
almost
forgot
where
he
was
going
and
he
paused
on
every
step
it
was
not
until
the
fresh
air
of
the
courtyard
blew
upon
his
face
reminding
him
of
the
realities
of
life
that
the
charlatanesque
element
in
his
nature
regained
the
ascendency
my
friend
he
said
addressing
casimir
who
was
lighting
him
out
you
must
at
once
have
some
straw
spread
over
the
street
so
as
to
deaden
the
sound
of
the
vehicles
and
you
must
inform
the
commissary
of
ten
minutes
later
a
thick
bed
of
straw
had
been
strewed
across
the
thoroughfare
and
the
drivers
of
passing
vehicles
involuntarily
slackened
their
speed
for
every
one
in
paris
knows
what
this
signifies
casimir
personally
superintended
the
work
which
was
intrusted
to
the
grooms
and
he
was
about
to
return
indoors
again
when
a
young
man
who
had
been
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
mansion
for
more
than
an
hour
hastily
approached
him
he
was
a
beardless
fellow
with
a
strangely
wrinkled
face
as
as
that
of
a
confirmed
his
general
expression
was
shrewd
and
at
the
same
time
impudent
and
surprising
audacity
gleamed
in
his
eyes
what
do
you
want
asked
casimir
the
young
fellow
bowed
humbly
and
replied
ah
don
t
you
recognize
me
monsieur
i
m
toto
excuse
me
victor
chupin
employed
by
isidore
oh

i
i
came
in
obedience
to
my
employer
s
orders
to
inquire
if
you
had
obtained
the
information
you
promised
him
but
seeing
that
something
had
happened
at
your
house
i
didn
t
dare
go
in
but
decided
to
watch
for
you
and
you
did
quite
right
my
lad
i
have
no
information
to
give
you
ah
yes
stop
the
marquis
de
valorsay

closeted

two
hours
yesterday
but
what
good
will

do
the
count
has
been
taken
suddenly
ill
and
he
will
scarcely
live
through
the
victor
chupin
was
thunderstruck
impossible
he
cried
is
it
for
him
that
the
straw
has
been
strewed
in
the
street
it
s
for
what
a
lucky
fellow
no
one
would
go
to
such
expense
for
me
but
i
have
an
idea
that
my
guv
nor
will
hardly
laugh
when
i
tell
him
this
still
thank
you
all
the
same
m
sieur
and
au
he
was
darting
off
when
a
sudden
thought
detained
him
excuse

said
he
with
conjuror
like
volubility
i
was
so
horrified
that
i
forgot
business

count

charge
of

on

verified
during
the
ceremony
no

well
is
it
understood
the
valet
shrugged
his
shoulders
nonsense
said
he
carelessly
what
is
all
that
to
me
ah
i
forgot
to
mention
that
there
would
be
a
commission
of
two
hundred
francs
to
divide
between
that
s
consideration
give
me
your
card
and
rely
on
me
my
compliments
to
fortunat
and
so
saying
he
the
house
victor
chupin
drew
a
huge
silver
watch
from
his
pocket
and
consulted
it
five
minutes
to
eight
he
growled
and
the
guv
nor
expects
me
at
eight
precisely
i
shall
have
to
stretch
out
my
ii
isidore
fortunat
resided
at
no
place
de
la
bourse
on
the
third
floor
he
had
a
handsome
suite
of
apartments
a
a
a
a
large
outer
office
where
his
clerks
worked
and
a
private
one
which
was
the
sanctuary
of
his
thoughts
and
meditations
the
whole
cost
him
only
six
thousand
francs
a
year
a
mere
trifle
as
rents
go
nowadays
his
lease
entitled
him
moreover
to
the
use
of
a
room
ten
feet
square
up
under
the
eaves
where
he
lodged
his
servant
madame
dodelin
a
woman
of
or
thereabouts
who
had
met
with
reverses
of
fortune
and
who
now
took
such
good
charge
of
his
establishment
that
his
table
for
he
ate
at
home
was
truly
fit
for
a
sybarite
having
been
established
here
for
five
years
or
more
fortunat
was
very
well
known
in
the
neighborhood
and
as
he
paid
his
rent
promptly
and
met
all
his
obligations
without
demur
he
was
generally
respected
besides
people
knew
very
well
from
what
source
fortunat
derived
his
income
he
gave
his
attention
to
contested
claims
liquidations
the
recovery
of
legacies
and
so
on
as
was
shown
by
the
inscription
in
large
letters
which
figured
on
the
elegant
brass
plate
adorning
his
door
he
must
have
had
a
prosperous
business
for
he
employed
six
collectors
in
addition
to
the
clerks
who
wrote
all
day
long
in
his
office
and
his
clients
were
so
numerous
that
the
concierge
was
often
heard
to
complain
of
the
way
they
ran
up
and
down
the
stairs
declaring
that
it
was
worse
than
a
procession
to
be
just
we
must
add
that
fortunat
s
appearance
manners
and
conduct
were
of
a
nature
to
quiet
all
suspicions
he
was
some
years
of
age
extremely
methodical
in
his
habits
gentle
and
refined
in
his
manner
intelligent
very
and
always
dressed
in
perfect
taste
he
was
accused
of
being
in
business
matters
as
cold
as
polished
and
as
hard
as
one
of
the
marble
slabs
of
the
morgue
but
then
no
one
was
obliged
to
employ
him
unless
they
chose
to
do
so
this
much
is
certain
he
did
not
frequent
cafes
or
places
of
amusement
if
he
went
out
at
all
after
dinner
it
was
only
to
pass
the
evening
at
the
house
of
some
rich
client
in
the
neighborhood
he
detested
the
smell
of
tobacco
and
was
inclined
to
be
devout
never
failing
to
attend
eight
o
clock
mass
on
sunday
mornings
his
housekeeper
suspected
him
of
matrimonial
designs
and
perhaps
she
was
right
on
the
evening
that
the
count
de
chalusse
was
struck
with
apoplexy
isidore
fortunat
had
been
dining
alone
and
was
sipping
a
cup
of
tea
when
the
rang
announcing
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
madame
dodelin
hastened
to
open
the
door
and
in
walked
victor
chupin
breathless
from
his
hurried
walk
it
had
not
taken
him
minutes
to
cover
the
distance
which
separates
the
rue
de
courcelles
from
the
place
de
la
bourse
you
are
late
victor
said
fortunat
quietly
that
s
true
monsieur
but
it
isn
t
my
fault
everything
was
in
confusion
down
there
and
i
was
obliged
to
how
is
that
why
the
count
de
chalusse
was
stricken
with
apoplexy
this
evening
and
he
is
probably
dead
by
this
fortunat
sprang
from
his
chair
with
a
livid
face
and
trembling
lips
stricken
with
apoplexy
he
exclaimed
in
a
husky
voice
i
am
ruined
then
fearing
madame
dodelin
s
curiosity
he
seized
the
lamp
and
rushed
into
his
office
crying
to
chupin
follow
chupin
obeyed
without
a
word
for
he
was
a
shrewd
fellow
and
knew
how
to
make
the
best
of
a
trying
situation
he
was
not
usually
allowed
to
enter
this
private
room
the
floor
of
which
was
covered
with
a
magnificent
carpet
and
so
after
carefully
closing
the
door
he
remained
standing
hat
in
hand
and
looking
somewhat
intimidated
but
fortunat
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
presence
after
depositing
the
lamp
on
the
he
walked
several
times
round
and
round
the
room
like
a
hunted
beast
seeking
for
some
means
of
egress
if
the
count
is
dead
he
muttered
the
marquis
de
valorsay
is
lost
farewell
to
the
millions
the
blow
was
so
cruel
and
so
entirely
unexpected
that
he
could
not
would
not
believe
in
its
reality
he
walked
straight
to
chupin
and
caught
him
by
the
collar
as
if
the
young
fellow
had
been
the
cause
of
this
misfortune
it
isn
t
possible
said
he
the
count
can
not
be
dead
you
are
deceiving
me
or
they
deceived
you
you
must
have
misunderstood
you
only
wished
to
give
some
excuse
for
your
delay
perhaps
speak
say
something
as
a
rule
chupin
was
not
easily
impressed
but
he
felt
almost
frightened
by
his
employer
s
agitation
i
only
repeated
what
casimir
told
me
monsieur
was
his
reply
he
then
wished
to
furnish
some
particulars
but
fortunat
had
already
resumed
his
furious
tramp
to
and
fro
giving
vent
to
his
wrath
and
despair
in
incoherent
exclamations
forty
thousand
francs
lost
he
exclaimed
forty
thousand
francs
counted
out
there
on
my
desk
i
see
them
yet
counted
and
placed
in
the
hand
of
the
marquis
de
valorsay
in
exchange
for
his
signature
my
savings
for
a
number
of
years
and
i
have
only
a
worthless
scrap
of
paper
to
show
for
them
that
cursed
marquis
and
he
was
to
come
here
this
evening
and
i
was
to
give
him
ten
thousand
francs
more
they
are
lying
there
in
that
drawer
let
him
come
the
wretch
let
him
come
anger
had
positively
brought
foam
to
fortunat
s
lips
and
any
one
seeing
him
then
would
subsequently
have
had
but
little
confidence
in
his
customary
air
and
unctuous
politeness
and
yet
the
marquis
is
as
much
to
be
pitied
as
i
am
he
continued
he
loses
as
much
even
more
and
such
a
sure
thing
it
seemed
too
what
speculation
can
a
fellow
engage
in
after
this
and
a
man
must
put
his
money
somewhere
he
can
t
bury
it
in
the
ground
chupin
listened
with
an
air
of
profound
commiseration
but
it
was
only
assumed
he
was
inwardly
jubilant
for
his
interest
in
the
affair
was
in
direct
opposition
to
that
of
his
employer
indeed
if
fortunat
lost
forty
thousand
francs
by
the
count
de
chalusse
s
death
chupin
expected
to
make
a
hundred
francs
commission
on
the
funeral
still
he
may
have
made
a
will
pursued
fortunat
but
no
i
m
sure
he
hasn
t
a
poor
devil
who
has
only
a
few
sous
to
leave
behind
him
always
takes
this
precaution
he
thinks
he
may
be
run
over
by
an
omnibus
and
suddenly
killed
and
he
always
writes
and
signs
his
last
wishes
but
millionaires
don
t
think
of
such
things
they
believe
themselves
immortal
he
paused
to
reflect
for
a
moment
for
power
of
reflection
had
returned
to
him
his
excitement
had
quickly
spent
itself
by
reason
of
its
very
violence
this
much
is
certain
he
resumed
slowly
and
in
a
more
composed
voice
whether
the
count
has
made
a
will
or
not
valorsay
will
lose
the
millions
he
expected
from
chalusse
if
there
is
no
will
mademoiselle
marguerite
won
t
have
a
sou
and
then
good
evening
if
there
is
one
this
devil
of
a
girl
suddenly
becoming
her
own
mistress
and
wealthy
into
the
bargain
will
send
monsieur
de
valorsay
about
his
business
especially
if
she
loves
another
as
he
himself
admits
and
in
that
case
again
good
evening
fortunat
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
pausing
in
front
of
the
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
arranged
his
disordered
hair
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
may
be
stunned
but
never
crushed
by
a
catastrophe
in
conclusion
he
muttered
i
must
enter
my
forty
thousand
francs
as
an
item
in
the
profit
and
loss
account
it
only
remains
to
be
seen
if
it
would
not
be
possible
to
regain
them
in
the
same
he
was
again
master
of
himself
and
never
had
his
mind
been
more
clear
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
leant
his
elbows
upon
it
rested
his
head
on
his
hands
and
remained
for
some
time
perfectly
motionless
but
there
was
triumph
in
his
gesture
when
he
at
last
looked
up
again
i
am
safe
he
muttered
so
low
that
chupin
could
not
hear
him
what
a
fool
i
was
if
there
is
no
will
a
fourth
of
the
millions
shall
be
mine
ah
when
a
man
knows
his
ground
he
never
need
lose
the
battle
but
i
must
act
quickly
he
added
very
and
so
speaking
he
rose
and
glanced
at
the
clock
nine
o
clock
said
he
i
must
open
the
campaign
this
very
motionless
in
his
dark
corner
chupin
still
retained
his
commiserating
attitude
but
he
was
so
oppressed
with
curiosity
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
he
opened
his
eyes
and
ears
to
the
utmost
and
watched
his
employer
s
slightest
movements
with
intense
interest
prompt
to
act
when
he
had
once
decided
upon
his
course
fortunat
now
drew
from
his
desk
a
large
portfolio
crammed
full
of
letters
receipts
bills
deeds
of
property
and
old
parchments
i
can
certainly
discover
the
necessary
pretext
here
he
murmured
rummaging
through
the
mass
of
papers
but
he
did
not
at
once
find
what
he
sought
and
he
was
growing
impatient
as
could
be
seen
by
his
feverish
haste
when
all
at
once
he
paused
with
a
sigh
of
relief
at
last
he
held
in
his
hand
a
soiled
and
crumpled
note
of
hand
affixed
by
a
pin
to
a
huissier
s
protest
thus
proving
conclusively
that
it
had
been
dishonored
fortunat
waved
these
strips
of
paper
triumphantly
and
with
a
satisfied
air
exclaimed
it
is
here
that
i
must
strike
it
is
here
if
casimir
hasn
t
deceived
me
that
i
shall
find
the
indispensable
information
i
he
was
in
such
haste
that
he
did
not
wait
to
put
his
portfolio
in
order
he
threw
it
with
the
papers
it
had
contained
into
the
drawer
of
his
desk
again
and
approaching
chupin
he
asked
it
was
you
was
it
not
victor
who
obtained
that
information
respecting
the
solvency
of
the
vantrassons
husband
and
wife
who
let
out
furnished
rooms
yes
monsieur
and
i
gave
you
the
answer
nothing
to
hope
for
i
know
but
that
doesn
t
matter
do
you
remember
their
address
perfectly
they
are
now
living
on
the
asnieres
road
beyond
the
fortifications
on
the
right
hand
what
is
the
number
chupin
hesitated
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
began
to
scratch
his
head
furiously
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
whenever
his
memory
failed
him
and
he
wished
to
recall
it
to
duty
i
m
not
sure
whether
the
number
is
eighteen
or
he
said
at
last
that
is
never
mind
interrupted
fortunat
if
i
sent
you
to
the
house
could
you
find
it
oh
yes
m
sieur
at
once
with
my
eyes
shut
i
can
see
the
place
perfectly
a
rickety
old
barrack
there
is
a
tract
of
unoccupied
land
on
one
side
and
a
in
the
very
well
you
shall
accompany
me
chupin
seemed
astonished
by
this
strange
proposal
what
m
sieur
said
he
do
you
think
of
going
there
at
this
time
of
night
why
not
shall
we
find
the
establishment
closed
no
certainly
not
vantrasson
doesn
t
merely
keep
furnished
rooms
he
s
a
grocer
and
sells
liquor
too
his
place
is
open
until
eleven
o
clock
at
least
but
if
you
are
going
there
to
present
a
bill
it
s
perhaps
a
little
late
if
i
were
in
your
place
m
sieur
i
should
wait
till
it
s
raining
and
the
streets
are
deserted
it
s
an
place
too
and
in
such
cases
a
man
has
been
known
to
settle
his
account
with
whatever
came
handiest
with
a
cudgel
or
a
bullet
for
are
you
afraid
this
question
seemed
so
utterly
absurd
to
chupin
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
offended
by
it
his
only
answer
was
a
disdainful
shrug
of
the
shoulders
then
we
will
go
remarked
fortunat
while
i
m
getting
ready
go
and
hire
a
cab
and
see
that
you
get
a
good
chupin
was
off
in
an
instant
tearing
down
the
staircase
like
a
tempest
there
was
a
only
a
few
steps
from
the
house
but
he
preferred
to
run
to
the
jobmaster
s
stables
in
the
rue
feydeau
cab
sir
shouted
several
men
as
they
saw
him
approaching
he
made
no
reply
but
began
to
examine
the
horses
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
until
at
last
he
found
an
animal
that
suited
him
thereupon
he
beckoned
to
the
driver
and
going
to
the
little
office
where
a
woman
sat
reading
my
five
sous
if
you
please
he
said
authoritatively
the
woman
looked
at
him
most
jobmasters
are
in
the
habit
of
giving
five
sous
to
any
servant
who
comes
in
search
of
a
cab
for
his
master
and
this
was
the
custom
here
but
the
keeper
of
the
office
who
felt
sure
that
chupin
was
not
a
servant
hesitated
and
this
made
the
young
fellow
angry
make
haste
he
cried
imperiously
if
you
don
t
i
shall
run
to
the
nearest
the
woman
at
once
threw
him
five
sous
which
he
pocketed
with
a
satisfied
grin
they
were
his
rightfully
his
since
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
gain
them
he
then
hastily
returned
to
the
office
to
inform
his
employer
that
the
cab
was
waiting
at
the
door
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
sight
which
made
him
open
his
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
fortunat
had
profited
by
his
clerk
s
absence
not
to
disguise
himself
that
would
be
saying
too
much
but
to
make
some
changes
in
his
appearance
he
had
arrayed
himself
in
a
long
overcoat
shiny
with
grease
and
wear
and
falling
below
his
knees
in
place
of
his
elegant
satin
cravat
he
had
knotted
a
gaudy
silk
neckerchief
about
his
throat
his
boots
were
worn
and
out
of
shape
and
his
hat
would
have
been
treated
with
contempt
even
by
a
dealer
in
old
clothes
of
the
prosperous
fortunat
so
favorably
known
round
about
the
place
de
la
bourse
naught
remained
save
his
face
and
his
hands
another
fortunat
had
taken
his
place
more
than
needy
in
aspect
wretched
famished
gaunt
with
hunger
ready
for
any
desperate
deed
and
yet
he
seemed
at
ease
in
this
garb
it
yielded
to
his
every
movement
as
if
he
had
worn
it
for
a
long
time
the
butterfly
had
become
a
chrysalis
again
chupin
s
admiring
smile
must
have
repaid
him
for
his
trouble
since
the
young
clerk
evinced
approval
fortunat
felt
sure
that
vantrasson
would
take
him
for
what
he
wished
to
appear
a
poor
devil
of
an
agent
who
was
acting
on
some
other
person
s
behalf
let
us
start
at
once
said
he
but
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
he
remembered
an
order
of
great
importance
which
he
wished
to
give
he
called
madame
dodelin
and
without
paying
the
slightest
heed
to
her
astonishment
at
seeing
him
thus
attired
if
the
marquis
de
valorsay
comes
in
my
absence
said
he
and
he
will
come
ask
him
to
wait
for
me
i
shall
return
before
midnight
don
t
take
him
into
my
office
he
can
wait
in
the
this
last
order
was
certainly
unnecessary
since
fortunat
had
closed
and
his
office
door
and
placed
the
key
carefully
in
his
own
pocket
but
perhaps
he
had
forgotten
this
circumstance
there
were
now
no
traces
of
his
recent
anger
and
disappointment
he
was
in
excellent
humor
and
you
might
have
supposed
that
he
was
starting
on
an
enterprise
from
which
he
expected
to
derive
both
pleasure
and
profit
chupin
was
climbing
to
a
place
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
when
his
employer
bade
him
take
a
seat
inside
the
vehicle
they
were
not
long
in
reaching
their
destination
for
the
horse
was
really
a
good
one
and
the
driver
had
been
stimulated
by
the
promise
of
a
magnificent
gratuity
in
fact
fortunat
and
his
companion
reached
the
asnieres
road
in
less
than
forty
minutes
in
obedience
to
the
orders
he
had
received
before
starting
the
cabman
drew
up
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
road
at
about
a
hundred
paces
from
the
city
gate
beyond
the
fortifications
well
sir
here
you
are
are
you
satisfied
he
inquired
as
he
opened
the
door
perfectly
satisfied
replied
fortunat
here
is
your
promised
gratuity
now
you
have
only
to
wait
for
us
don
t
stir
from
this
place
do
you
understand
but
the
driver
shook
his
head
excuse
me
he
said
but
if
it
s
all
the
same
to
you
i
will
station
myself
over
there
near
the
gate
here
you
see
i
should
be
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
while
over
there
very
well
suit
yourself
fortunat
replied
this
precaution
on
the
driver
s
part
convinced
him
that
chupin
had
not
exaggerated
the
evil
reputation
of
this
quarter
of
the
parisian
suburbs
and
indeed
there
was
little
of
a
reassuring
character
in
the
aspect
of
this
broad
road
quite
deserted
at
this
hour
and
shrouded
in
the
darkness
of
a
tempestuous
night
the
rain
had
ceased
falling
but
the
wind
blew
with
increased
violence
twisting
the
branches
off
the
trees
tearing
slates
from
the
roofs
and
shaking
the
so
furiously
as
to
extinguish
the
gas
they
could
not
see
a
step
before
them
the
mud
was
and
not
a
person
not
a
solitary
soul
was
visible
are
we
almost
there
fortunat
asked
every
ten
paces
almost
there
m
chupin
said
this
but
to
tell
the
truth
he
knew
nothing
about
it
he
tried
to
discover
where
he
was
but
did
not
succeed
houses
were
becoming
scanty
and
vacant
plots
of
building
ground
more
numerous
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
one
could
occasionally
discern
a
light
at
last
however
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
hard
struggling
chupin
uttered
a
joyful
cry
here
we
are
m
sieur
look
said
he
a
large
building
five
stories
high
sinister
of
aspect
and
standing
quite
alone
could
just
be
distinguished
in
the
darkness
it
was
already
falling
to
pieces
and
yet
it
was
not
entirely
completed
plainly
enough
the
speculator
who
had
undertaken
the
enterprise
had
not
been
rich
enough
to
complete
it
on
seeing
the
many
closely
pierced
windows
of
the
facade
a
could
not
fail
to
divine
for
what
purpose
the
building
had
been
erected
and
in
order
that
no
one
should
remain
in
ignorance
of
it
this
inscription
furnished
rooms
figured
in
letters
three
feet
high
between
the
third
and
fourth
floors
the
inside
arrangements
could
be
easily
divined
innumerable
rooms
all
small
and
inconvenient
and
let
out
at
exorbitant
rentals
however
victor
chupin
s
memory
had
misled
him
this
establishment
was
not
on
the
right
but
on
the
side
of
the
road
a
perfect
mire
through
which
fortunat
and
his
companion
were
obliged
to
cross
their
eyes
having
become
accustomed
to
the
darkness
they
could
discern
sundry
details
as
they
approached
the
building
the
ground
floor
comprised
two
shops
one
of
which
was
closed
but
the
other
was
still
open
and
a
faint
light
gleamed
through
the
soiled
red
curtains
over
the
frontage
appeared
the
s
name
vantrasson
while
on
either
side
in
smaller
letters
were
the
words
groceries
and
provisions
foreign
and
french
everything
about
this
den
denoted
abject
poverty
and
low
debauchery
fortunat
certainly
did
not
recoil
but
before
entering
the
shop
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
an
opportunity
to
reconnoitre
he
approached
cautiously
and
peered
through
the
window
at
a
place
where
a
rent
in
the
curtain
allowed
him
some
view
of
the
interior
behind
the
counter
a
woman
who
looked
some
fifty
years
of
age
was
seated
mending
a
soiled
dress
by
the
light
of
a
smoking
lamp
she
was
short
and
very
stout
she
seemed
literally
weighed
down
and
puffed
out
by
an
unwholesome
and
unnatural
mass
of
superfluous
flesh
and
she
was
as
white
as
if
her
veins
had
been
filled
with
water
instead
of
blood
her
hanging
cheeks
her
receding
forehead
and
her
thin
lips
imparted
an
alarming
expression
of
wickedness
and
cunning
to
her
countenance
at
the
farther
end
of
the
store
fortunat
could
vaguely
discern
the
figure
of
a
man
seated
on
a
stool
he
seemed
to
be
asleep
for
his
crossed
arms
rested
on
a
table
with
his
head
leaning
on
them
good
luck
whispered
chupin
in
his
employer
s
ear
there
is
not
a
customer
in
the
place
vantrasson
and
his
wife
are
this
circumstance
was
by
no
means
displeasing
to
fortunat
as
could
be
seen
by
his
expression
of
face
so
m
sieur
continued
chupin
you
need
have
no
fears
i
ll
remain
here
and
watch
while
you
go
fortunat
did
so
on
hearing
the
door
open
and
shut
the
woman
laid
down
her
work
what
can
i
do
for
monsieur
she
asked
in
a
wheedling
voice
fortunat
did
not
reply
at
once
but
he
drew
the
note
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
from
his
pocket
and
displayed
it
i
am
a
huissier
s
clerk
he
then
exclaimed
and
i
called
in
reference
to
this
little
matter
a
note
of
hand
for
five
hundred
and
francs
value
received
in
goods
signed
vantrasson
and
made
payable
to
the
order
of
a
person
named
an
execution
said
the
woman
whose
voice
suddenly
soured
vantrasson
wake
up
and
come
and
see
about
this
summons
was
unnecessary
on
hearing
the
words
note
of
hand
the
man
had
lifted
his
head
and
at
the
name
of
barutin
he
rose
and
approached
with
a
heavy
uncertain
step
as
if
he
had
not
yet
slept
off
his
intoxication
he
was
younger
than
his
wife
tall
with
a
and
athletic
form
his
features
were
regular
but
the
abuse
of
alcohol
and
all
sorts
of
excesses
had
greatly
marred
them
and
their
present
expression
was
one
of
ferocious
brutishness
what
s
that
you
are
talking
about
he
asked
in
a
harsh
grating
voice
is
it
to
mock
people
that
you
come
and
ask
for
money
on
the
of
october
rent
day
where
have
you
seen
any
money
left
after
the
landlord
has
made
his
round
besides
what
is
this
bill
give
it
me
to
look
fortunat
was
not
guilty
of
such
folly
he
did
not
intrust
the
paper
to
vantrasson
s
hand
but
held
it
a
little
distance
from
him
and
then
read
it
aloud
when
he
had
finished
that
note
fell
due
eighteen
months
ago
declared
vantrasson
it
is
worth
nothing
you
are
mistaken
a
note
of
this
kind
is
of
value
any
time
within
five
years
after
the
day
it
goes
to
possibly
but
as
barutin
has
failed
and
gone
no
one
knows
where
i
am
released
another
mistake
on
your
part
you
owe
these
five
hundred
and
francs
to
the
person
who
bought
this
note
at
barutin
s
sale
and
who
has
given
my
employer
orders
to
prosecute
the
blood
had
risen
to
vantrasson
s
face
and
what
of
that
do
you
suppose
i
ve
never
been
sued
for
debts
before
even
the
king
can
t
take
anything
from
a
person
who
possesses
nothing
and
i
own
nothing
my
furniture
is
all
pawned
or
mortgaged
and
my
stock
is
not
worth
a
hundred
francs
when
your
employer
finds
it
useless
to
waste
money
in
worrying
me
he
ll
let
me
alone
you
can
t
injure
a
man
like
do
you
really
think
so
i
m
sure
of
unfortunately
you
are
again
mistaken
for
although
the
holder
of
the
note
doesn
t
care
so
very
much
about
obtaining
his
dues
he
ll
spend
his
own
money
like
water
to
make
trouble
for
and
thereupon
fortunat
began
to
draw
a
vivid
and
frightful
picture
of
a
poor
debtor
pursued
by
a
rich
creditor
who
harassed
him
and
tortured
him
and
hounded
him
everywhere
until
not
even
a
change
of
clothing
was
left
him
vantrasson
rolled
his
eyes
and
brandished
his
formidable
fist
in
the
most
defiant
manner
but
his
wife
was
evidently
much
alarmed
at
last
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
rising
hastily
she
led
her
husband
to
the
rear
of
the
shop
saying
come
i
must
speak
with
he
followed
her
and
they
remained
for
some
little
time
conversing
together
in
a
low
tone
but
with
excited
gestures
when
they
returned
the
woman
opened
the
conversation
alas
sir
she
said
to
fortunat
we
have
no
money
just
now
business
is
so
very
bad
and
if
you
prosecute
us
we
are
lost
what
can
be
done
you
look
like
an
honest
man
give
us
your
fortunat
did
not
reply
at
once
he
was
apparently
absorbed
in
thought
but
suddenly
he
exclaimed
one
owes
a
duty
to
unfortunate
folks
and
i
m
going
to
tell
you
the
exact
truth
my
employer
who
isn
t
a
bad
man
at
heart
hasn
t
the
slightest
desire
for
revenge
he
said
to
me
go
and
see
these
vantrassons
and
if
they
seem
to
be
worthy
people
propose
a
compromise
if
they
choose
to
accept
it
i
shall
be
quite
and
what
is
this
compromise
it
is
this
you
must
write
an
acknowledgment
of
the
debt
on
a
sheet
of
stamped
paper
together
with
a
promise
to
pay
a
little
on
account
each
month
in
exchange
i
will
give
you
this
note
of
the
husband
and
wife
exchanged
glances
and
it
was
the
woman
who
said
we
but
to
carry
out
this
arrangement
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
sheet
of
stamped
paper
and
the
spurious
clerk
had
neglected
to
provide
himself
with
some
this
circumstance
seemed
to
annoy
him
greatly
and
you
might
almost
have
sworn
that
he
regretted
the
concession
he
had
promised
did
he
think
of
going
madame
vantrasson
feared
so
and
turning
eagerly
to
her
husband
she
exclaimed
run
to
the
tobacco
shop
in
the
rue
de
levis
you
will
find
some
paper
there
he
started
off
at
once
and
fortunat
breathed
freely
again
he
had
certainly
retained
his
composure
admirably
during
the
interview
but
more
than
once
he
had
fancied
that
vantrasson
was
about
to
spring
on
him
crush
him
with
his
brawny
hands
tear
the
note
from
him
burn
it
and
then
throw
him
fortunat
out
into
the
street
helpless
and
nearly
dead
but
now
that
danger
had
passed
and
madame
vantrasson
fearing
he
might
tire
of
waiting
was
prodigal
in
her
attentions
she
brought
him
the
only
unbroken
chair
in
the
establishment
and
insisted
that
he
should
partake
of
some
refreshment
a
glass
of
wine
at
the
very
least
while
rummaging
among
the
bottles
she
alternately
thanked
him
and
complained
declaring
she
had
a
right
to
repine
since
she
had
known
better
days
but
fate
had
been
against
her
ever
since
her
marriage
though
she
had
little
thought
she
would
end
her
days
in
such
misery
after
having
been
so
happy
in
the
count
de
chalusse
s
household
many
years
before
to
all
appearance
fortunat
listened
with
the
mere
superficial
interest
which
ordinary
politeness
requires
one
to
show
but
in
reality
his
heart
was
filled
with
intense
delight
coming
here
without
any
plan
circumstances
had
served
him
a
thousand
times
better
than
he
could
reasonably
have
hoped
he
had
preserved
his
power
over
the
vantrassons
had
won
their
confidence
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
with
the
wife
and
to
crown
all
this
woman
alluded
of
her
own
accord
to
the
very
subject
upon
which
he
was
longing
to
question
her
ah
if
i
were
only
back
in
the
count
s
household
again
she
exclaimed
six
hundred
francs
a
year
and
gifts
worth
double
that
amount
those
were
good
times
for
me
but
you
know
how
it
is
one
is
never
content
with
one
s
lot
and
then
the
heart
is
weak
she
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
the
sweet
wine
which
she
proposed
to
her
guest
so
in
its
place
she
substituted
a
mixture
of
ratafia
and
brandy
in
two
large
glasses
which
she
placed
upon
the
counter
one
evening
to
my
sorrow
she
resumed
i
met
vantrasson
at
a
ball
it
was
the
day
of
the
month
i
might
have
known
no
good
would
come
of
it
ah
you
should
have
seen
him
at
that
time
in
full
uniform
he
belonged
to
the
paris
guards
then
all
the
women
were
crazy
about
soldiers
and
my
head
was
turned
too
her
tone
her
gestures
and
the
compression
of
her
thin
lips
revealed
the
bitterness
of
her
disappointment
and
her
unavailing
regret
ah
these
handsome
men
she
continued
don
t
talk
to
me
about
them
this
one
had
heard
of
my
savings
i
had
nineteen
thousand
francs
so
he
begged
me
to
marry
him
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
consent
yes
fool
for
i
was
forty
and
he
was
only
thirty
i
might
have
known
it
was
my
money
that
he
wanted
and
not
me
however
i
gave
up
my
situation
and
even
purchased
a
substitute
for
him
in
order
that
i
might
have
him
all
to
she
had
gradually
warmed
with
her
theme
as
she
described
her
confidence
and
blind
credulity
and
then
with
a
tragic
gesture
as
if
she
desired
to
drive
away
these
cruel
memories
she
suddenly
seized
her
glass
and
emptied
it
at
a
draught
chupin
who
was
still
at
his
post
outside
experienced
a
thrill
of
envy
and
involuntarily
licked
his
lips
a
mixed
ratafia
he
said
longingly
i
shouldn
t
object
to
one
however
this
choice
compound
seemed
to
inspire
madame
vantrasson
with
renewed
energy
for
with
still
greater
earnestness
she
resumed
at
first
all
went
well
we
employed
my
savings
in
purchasing
the
hotel
des
espagnes
in
the
rue
notre
dame
des
victoires
and
business
prospered
there
was
never
a
vacant
room
but
any
person
who
has
drank
sir
will
drink
again
vantrasson
kept
sober
for
a
few
months
but
gradually
he
fell
into
his
old
habits
he
was
in
such
a
condition
most
of
the
time
that
he
was
scarcely
able
to
ask
for
food
and
if
that
had
been
all
but
unfortunately
he
was
too
handsome
a
man
to
be
a
good
husband
one
night
he
didn
t
come
home
and
the
next
day
when
i
ventured
to
reproach
him
very
gently
i
assure
you
he
answered
me
with
an
oath
and
a
blow
all
our
happiness
was
over
monsieur
declared
that
he
was
master
and
would
do
as
he
liked
he
drank
and
carried
away
all
the
wine
from
the
cellar
he
took
all
the
money
he
remained
away
for
weeks
together
and
if
i
complained
more
blows
her
voice
trembled
and
a
tear
gathered
in
her
eye
but
wiping
it
away
with
the
back
of
her
hand
she
resumed
vantrasson
was
always
drunk
and
i
spent
my
time
in
crying
my
very
eyes
out
business
became
very
bad
and
soon
everybody
left
the
house
we
were
obliged
to
sell
it
we
did
so
and
bought
a
small
cafe
but
by
the
end
of
the
year
we
lost
that
fortunately
i
still
had
a
little
money
left
and
so
i
bought
a
stock
of
groceries
in
my
own
name
but
in
less
than
six
months
the
stock
was
eaten
up
and
we
were
cast
into
the
street
what
was
to
be
done
vantrasson
drank
worse
than
ever
he
demanded
money
when
he
knew
that
i
had
none
to
give
him
and
he
treated
me
even
more
cruelly
than
before
i
lost
courage
and
yet
one
must
live
oh
you
wouldn
t
believe
it
if
i
told
you
how
we
have
lived
for
the
past
four
she
did
not
tell
him
but
contented
herself
with
adding
when
you
begin
to
go
down
hill
there
is
no
such
thing
as
stopping
you
roll
lower
and
lower
until
you
reach
the
bottom
as
we
have
done
here
we
live
no
one
knows
how
we
have
to
pay
our
rent
each
week
and
if
we
are
driven
from
this
place
i
see
no
refuge
but
the
if
i
had
been
in
your
position
i
should
have
left
my
husband
fortunat
ventured
to
remark
yes
it
would
have
been
better
no
doubt
people
advised
me
to
do
so
and
i
tried
three
or
four
times
i
went
away
and
yet
i
always
returned
it
was
stronger
than
myself
besides
i
m
his
wife
i
ve
paid
dearly
for
him
he
s
mine
i
won
t
yield
him
to
any
one
else
he
beats
me
no
doubt
i
despise
him
i
hate
him
and
yet
i
she
poured
out
part
of
a
glass
of
brandy
and
swallowed
it
then
with
a
gesture
of
rage
she
added
i
can
t
give
him
up
it
s
fate
as
it
is
now
it
will
be
until
the
end
until
he
starves
or
i
fortunat
s
countenance
wore
an
expression
of
profound
commiseration
a
would
have
supposed
him
interested
and
sympathetic
to
the
last
degree
but
in
reality
he
was
furious
time
was
passing
and
the
conversation
was
wandering
farther
and
farther
from
the
object
of
his
visit
i
am
surprised
madame
said
he
that
you
never
applied
to
your
former
employer
the
count
de
alas
i
did
apply
to
him
for
assistance
several
times
with
what
result
the
first
time
i
went
to
him
he
received
me
i
told
him
my
troubles
and
he
gave
me
to
the
amount
of
five
thousand
fortunat
raised
his
hands
to
the
ceiling
five
thousand
francs
he
repeated
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
this
count
must
be
very
rich
so
rich
monsieur
that
he
doesn
t
know
how
much
he
s
worth
he
owns
nobody
knows
how
many
houses
in
paris
chateaux
in
every
part
of
the
country
entire
villages
forests
his
gold
comes
in
by
the
the
spurious
clerk
closed
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
dazzled
by
this
vision
of
wealth
the
second
time
i
went
to
the
count
s
house
resumed
madame
vantrasson
i
didn
t
see
him
but
he
sent
me
a
thousand
francs
the
third
and
last
time
they
gave
me
twenty
francs
at
the
door
and
told
me
that
the
count
had
gone
on
a
journey
i
understood
that
i
could
hope
for
no
further
help
from
him
besides
all
the
servants
had
been
changed
one
morning
without
any
apparent
reason
de
chalusse
dismissed
all
the
old
servants
so
they
told
me
he
even
sent
away
the
concierge
and
the
why
didn
t
you
apply
to
his
wife
m
de
chalusse
isn
t
married
he
never
has
been
from
the
expression
of
solicitude
upon
her
guest
s
features
madame
vantrasson
supposed
he
was
racking
his
brain
to
discover
some
mode
of
escape
from
her
present
difficulties
if
i
were
in
your
place
he
said
i
should
try
to
interest
his
relatives
and
family
in
my
case
the
count
has
no
impossible
he
hasn
t
indeed
during
the
ten
years
i
was
in
his
service
i
heard
him
say
more
than
a
dozen
times
that
he
alone
was
left
of
all
his
family
that
all
the
others
were
dead
people
pretend
that
this
is
the
reason
why
he
is
so
immensely
fortunat
s
interest
was
no
longer
assumed
he
was
rapidly
approaching
the
real
object
of
his
visit
no
relatives
he
muttered
who
then
will
inherit
his
millions
when
he
dies
madame
vantrasson
jerked
her
head
who
can
say
she
replied
everything
will
go
to
the
government
probably
unless
but
no
that
s
what
s
impossible
nothing
i
was
thinking
of
the
count
s
sister
mademoiselle
his
sister
why
you
said
just
now
that
he
had
no
it
s
the
same
as
if
he
hadn
t
no
one
knows
what
has
become
of
her
poor
creature
some
say
that
she
married
others
declare
that
she
died
it
s
quite
a
isidore
fortunat
was
literally
upon
the
rack
and
to
make
his
sufferings
still
more
horrible
he
dared
not
ask
any
direct
question
nor
allow
his
curiosity
to
become
manifest
for
fear
of
alarming
the
woman
let
me
see
said
he
i
think
i
am
sure
that
i
have
heard
or
that
i
have
read
i
can
not
say
which
some
story
about
a
mademoiselle
de
chalusse
it
was
something
terrible
wasn
t
it
terrible
indeed
but
what
i
was
speaking
of
happened
a
long
time
ago
or
years
ago
at
the
very
least
i
was
still
in
my
own
part
of
the
country
at
besancon
no
one
knows
the
exact
truth
about
the
what
not
even
you
oh
i
that
s
an
entirely
different
thing
when
i
entered
the
count
s
service
six
years
later
there
was
still
an
old
gardener
who
knew
the
whole
story
and
who
told
it
to
me
making
me
swear
that
i
would
never
betray
his
lavish
of
details
as
she
had
been
in
telling
her
own
story
it
was
evident
that
she
was
determined
to
exercise
a
prudent
reserve
in
everything
connected
with
the
de
chalusse
family
and
fortunat
inwardly
cursed
this
to
him
most
unseasonable
discretion
but
he
was
experienced
in
these
examinations
and
he
had
at
his
command
little
tricks
for
loosening
tongues
which
even
an
investigating
magistrate
might
have
envied
without
seeming
to
attach
the
slightest
importance
to
madame
vantrasson
s
narrative
he
rose
with
a
startled
air
like
a
man
who
suddenly
realizes
that
he
has
forgotten
himself
zounds
he
exclaimed
we
sit
here
gossiping
and
it
s
growing
late
i
really
can
t
wait
for
your
husband
if
i
remain
here
any
longer
i
shall
miss
the
last
omnibus
and
i
live
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
near
the
but
our
agreement
monsieur
we
will
draw
that
up
at
some
future
time
i
shall
be
passing
again
or
i
will
send
one
of
my
colleagues
to
see
it
was
madame
vantrasson
s
turn
to
tremble
now
she
feared
if
she
allowed
this
supposed
clerk
to
go
without
signing
the
agreement
that
the
person
who
came
in
his
stead
might
not
prove
so
accommodating
and
even
if
he
called
again
himself
he
might
not
be
so
kindly
disposed
wait
just
a
moment
longer
monsieur
she
pleaded
my
husband
will
soon
be
back
and
the
last
omnibus
doesn
t
leave
the
rue
de
levis
until
i
wouldn
t
refuse
but
this
part
of
the
suburbs
is
so
vantrasson
will
see
you
on
your
and
resolved
to
detain
him
at
any
cost
she
poured
out
a
fresh
glass
of
liquor
for
him
and
said
where
were
we
oh
yes
i
was
about
to
tell
you
mademoiselle
hermine
s
concealing
his
delight
with
an
assumed
air
of
resignation
fortunat
reseated
himself
to
the
intense
disgust
of
chupin
who
was
thoroughly
tired
of
waiting
outside
in
the
cold
i
must
tell
you
began
madame
vantrasson
that
when
this
happened
at
least
years
ago
the
de
chalusse
family
lived
in
the
rue
they
occupied
a
superb
mansion
with
extensive
grounds
full
of
splendid
trees
like
those
in
the
tuileries
gardens
mademoiselle
hermine
who
was
then
about
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
old
was
according
to
all
accounts
the
prettiest
young
creature
ever
seen
her
skin
was
as
white
as
milk
she
had
a
profusion
of
golden
hair
and
her
eyes
were
as
blue
as
she
was
very
kind
and
generous
they
say
only
like
all
the
rest
of
the
family
she
was
very
haughty
and
obstinate
oh
obstinate
enough
to
allow
herself
to
be
roasted
alive
over
a
slow
fire
rather
than
yield
an
inch
that
s
the
count
s
nature
exactly
having
served
him
i
know
something
about
it
to
be
sure
and
excuse
me
interrupted
fortunat
who
was
determined
to
prevent
these
digressions
and
mademoiselle
hermine
i
was
coming
to
her
although
she
was
very
beautiful
and
immensely
rich
she
had
no
suitors
for
it
was
generally
understood
that
she
was
to
marry
a
marquis
whose
father
was
a
particular
friend
of
the
family
the
parents
had
arranged
the
matter
between
them
years
before
and
nothing
was
wanting
but
the
young
lady
s
consent
but
mademoiselle
hermine
absolutely
refused
to
hear
the
marquis
s
name
mentioned
they
did
everything
to
persuade
her
to
consent
to
this
marriage
they
employed
prayers
and
threats
alike
but
they
might
as
well
have
talked
to
a
stone
when
they
asked
her
why
she
refused
to
marry
the
marquis
she
replied
because
and
that
was
all
in
fact
at
last
she
declared
she
would
leave
home
and
take
refuge
in
a
convent
if
they
didn
t
cease
to
torment
her
her
relatives
were
certain
there
must
be
some
reason
for
her
refusal
it
isn
t
natural
for
a
girl
to
reject
a
suitor
who
is
young
handsome
rich
and
a
marquis
besides
her
friends
suspected
there
was
something
she
wouldn
t
confess
and
raymond
swore
that
he
would
watch
his
sister
and
discover
her
m
raymond
is
the
present
count
de
chalusse
i
suppose
inquired
fortunat
yes
monsieur
such
was
the
state
of
matters
when
one
night
the
gardener
thought
he
heard
a
noise
in
the
pavilion
at
the
end
of
the
garden
this
pavilion
was
very
large
i
have
seen
it
it
contained
a
a
and
a
large
naturally
enough
the
gardener
got
up
to
go
and
see
what
was
the
matter
as
he
left
the
house
he
fancied
he
saw
two
persons
moving
about
among
the
trees
he
ran
after
them
but
could
find
nothing
they
had
made
their
escape
through
a
small
gate
leading
from
the
garden
into
the
street
when
the
gardener
was
telling
me
this
story
he
declared
again
and
again
that
he
had
fancied
the
noise
he
had
heard
was
made
by
some
of
the
servants
trying
to
leave
the
house
secretly
and
for
this
reason
he
didn
t
give
the
alarm
however
he
hurried
to
the
pavilion
but
on
seeing
no
light
there
he
went
back
to
bed
with
an
easy
and
it
was
mademoiselle
hermine
eloping
with
a
lover
asked
fortunat
madame
vantrasson
seemed
as
disappointed
as
an
actor
who
has
been
deprived
of
an
opportunity
of
producing
a
grand
effect
wait
a
moment
she
replied
and
you
ll
see
the
night
passed
morning
came
and
then
the
breakfast
hour
but
mademoiselle
hermine
did
not
make
her
appearance
some
one
was
sent
to
rap
at
her
door
there
was
no
answer
the
door
was
opened
the
young
lady
was
not
in
her
room
and
the
bed
had
not
even
been
disturbed
in
a
few
moments
the
whole
household
was
in
the
wildest
commotion
the
mother
weeping
and
the
father
half
wild
with
rage
and
sorrow
of
course
the
next
thought
was
of
mademoiselle
hermine
s
brother
and
he
was
sent
for
but
he
too
was
not
in
his
room
and
his
bed
had
not
been
touched
the
excitement
was
becoming
frenzy
when
it
occurred
to
the
gardener
to
mention
what
he
had
heard
and
seen
on
the
previous
night
they
hastened
to
the
pavilion
and
discovered
what
why
raymond
stretched
upon
the
ground
stiff
cold
and
motionless
weltering
in
his
own
blood
one
of
his
rigid
hands
still
grasped
a
sword
they
lifted
him
up
carried
him
to
the
house
laid
him
upon
his
bed
and
sent
for
a
physician
he
had
received
two
dangerous
wounds
one
in
the
throat
the
other
in
the
breast
for
more
than
a
month
he
hung
between
life
and
death
and
six
weeks
elapsed
before
he
had
strength
to
relate
what
had
happened
he
was
lighting
a
cigar
at
his
window
when
he
thought
he
saw
a
woman
s
form
flit
through
the
garden
a
suspicion
that
it
might
be
his
sister
flashed
through
his
mind
so
he
hastened
down
stole
noiselessly
into
the
pavilion
and
there
he
found
his
sister
and
a
young
man
who
was
absolutely
unknown
to
him
he
might
have
killed
the
intruder
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
told
him
they
would
fight
then
and
there
weapons
were
within
reach
and
they
fought
with
the
result
that
raymond
was
wounded
twice
in
quick
succession
and
fell
his
adversary
supposing
him
dead
thereupon
fled
from
the
spot
taking
mademoiselle
hermine
with
at
this
point
in
her
narrative
madame
vantrasson
evinced
a
desire
to
pause
and
draw
a
breath
and
perhaps
partake
of
some
slight
refreshment
but
fortunat
was
impatient
the
woman
s
husband
might
return
at
any
moment
and
after
that
he
inquired
after
that
well
raymond
recovered
and
in
about
three
months
time
he
was
out
again
but
the
parents
who
were
old
folks
had
received
their
they
never
rallied
from
the
shock
perhaps
they
felt
that
it
was
their
own
and
obstinacy
that
had
caused
their
daughter
s
ruin
and
remorse
is
hard
to
bear
they
waned
perceptibly
from
day
to
day
and
during
the
following
year
they
were
borne
to
the
cemetery
within
two
months
of
each
from
the
spurious
clerk
s
demeanor
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
ceased
thinking
about
his
omnibus
and
his
hostess
felt
both
reassured
and
flattered
and
mademoiselle
hermine
he
inquired
eagerly
alas
monsieur
no
one
ever
knew
where
she
went
or
what
became
of
didn
t
they
try
to
find
her
they
searched
for
her
everywhere
for
i
don
t
know
how
long
all
the
ablest
detectives
in
france
and
in
foreign
countries
tried
to
find
her
but
not
one
of
them
succeeded
in
discovering
the
slightest
trace
of
her
whereabouts
raymond
promised
an
enormous
sum
to
the
man
who
would
find
his
sister
s
betrayer
he
wished
to
kill
him
and
he
sought
for
him
for
years
but
all
in
and
did
they
never
receive
any
tidings
of
this
unfortunate
girl
i
was
told
that
they
heard
from
her
twice
on
the
morning
following
her
flight
her
parents
received
a
letter
in
which
she
implored
their
forgiveness
five
or
six
months
later
she
wrote
again
to
say
that
she
knew
her
brother
was
not
dead
she
confessed
that
she
was
a
wicked
ungrateful
girl
that
she
had
been
mad
but
she
said
that
her
punishment
had
come
and
it
was
terrible
she
added
that
every
link
was
severed
between
herself
and
her
friends
and
she
hoped
they
would
forget
her
as
completely
as
if
she
had
never
existed
she
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
her
children
should
never
know
who
their
mother
was
and
that
never
in
her
life
again
would
she
utter
the
name
which
she
had
so
it
was
the
old
sad
story
of
a
ruined
girl
paying
for
a
moment
s
madness
with
her
happiness
and
all
her
after
life
a
terrible
drama
no
doubt
but
one
that
is
of
such
frequent
occurrence
that
it
seems
as
commonplace
as
life
itself
thus
any
one
who
was
acquainted
with
isidore
fortunat
would
have
been
surprised
to
see
how
greatly
he
was
moved
by
such
a
trifle
poor
girl
said
he
in
view
of
saying
something
and
then
in
a
tone
of
assumed
carelessness
he
inquired
did
they
never
discover
what
scoundrel
carried
mademoiselle
de
chalusse
away
never
who
he
was
whence
he
came
whether
he
was
young
or
old
how
he
became
acquainted
with
mademoiselle
hermine
these
questions
were
never
answered
it
was
rumored
at
one
time
that
he
was
an
american
a
captain
in
the
navy
but
that
was
only
a
rumor
to
tell
the
truth
they
never
even
discovered
his
what
not
even
his
name
not
even
his
unable
to
master
his
emotion
fortunat
had
at
least
the
presence
of
mind
to
rise
and
step
back
into
the
darker
part
of
the
shop
but
his
gesture
of
disappointment
and
the
muttered
oath
that
fell
from
his
lips
did
not
escape
madame
vantrasson
she
was
startled
and
from
that
moment
she
looked
upon
the
supposed
clerk
with
evident
distrust
it
was
not
long
before
he
again
resumed
his
seat
nearer
the
counter
still
a
trifle
pale
perhaps
but
apparently
calm
two
questions
more
seemed
indispensable
to
him
and
yet
either
one
of
them
would
be
sure
to
arouse
suspicion
nevertheless
he
resolved
to
incur
the
risk
of
betraying
himself
and
after
all
what
would
it
matter
now
did
he
not
possess
the
information
he
had
wished
for
at
least
as
much
of
it
as
it
was
in
this
woman
s
power
to
impart
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
my
dear
madame
how
much
your
narrative
has
interested
me
he
began
i
can
confess
now
that
i
am
slightly
acquainted
with
the
count
de
chalusse
and
that
i
have
frequently
visited
the
house
in
the
rue
de
courcelles
where
he
now
you
exclaimed
the
woman
taking
a
hasty
inventory
of
fortunat
s
toilette
yes
i
on
the
part
of
my
employer
understand
each
time
i
ve
been
to
visit
de
chalusse
s
i
ve
seen
a
young
lady
whom
i
took
for
his
daughter
there
i
was
wrong
no
doubt
since
he
isn
t
a
married
man
he
paused
astonishment
and
anger
seemed
to
be
almost
suffocating
his
hostess
without
understanding
how
or
why
she
felt
convinced
that
she
had
been
duped
and
if
she
had
obeyed
her
first
impulse
she
would
have
attacked
isidore
then
and
there
if
she
restrained
this
impulse
if
she
made
an
effort
to
control
herself
it
was
only
because
she
thought
she
held
a
better
revenge
in
reserve
a
young
lady
in
the
count
s
house
she
said
thoughtfully
that
s
scarcely
possible
i
ve
never
seen
her
i
ve
never
heard
her
spoken
of
how
long
has
she
been
there
for
six
or
seven
months
in
that
case
i
can
t
absolutely
deny
it
it
s
two
years
since
i
set
foot
in
the
count
s
i
fancied
this
young
lady
might
be
the
count
s
niece
mademoiselle
hermine
s
madame
vantrasson
shook
her
head
put
that
fancy
out
of
your
head
she
remarked
the
count
said
that
his
sister
was
dead
to
him
from
the
evening
of
her
who
can
this
young
girl
be
then
bless
me
i
don
t
know
what
sort
of
a
looking
person
is
she
very
tall
a
how
old
is
she
eighteen
or
the
woman
made
a
rapid
calculation
on
her
fingers
nine
and
four
are
thirteen
she
muttered
and
five
are
eighteen
ah
ha
why
not
i
must
look
into
what
did
you
say
nothing
a
little
reflection
i
was
making
to
myself
do
you
know
this
young
lady
s
name
it
s
the
woman
s
face
clouded
no
it
can
t
be
then
she
muttered
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
fortunat
was
on
coals
of
fire
it
was
evident
that
this
frightful
creature
even
if
she
knew
nothing
definite
had
some
idea
some
vague
suspicion
of
the
truth
how
could
he
compel
her
to
speak
now
that
she
was
on
her
guard
he
had
not
time
to
ascertain
for
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
vantrasson
appeared
on
the
threshold
he
was
scarcely
sober
when
he
left
the
shop
but
now
he
was
fairly
drunk
his
heavy
shamble
had
become
a
stagger
oh
you
wretch
you
brigand
howled
his
wife
you
ve
been
drinking
again
he
succeeded
in
maintaining
his
equilibrium
and
gazing
at
her
with
the
phlegmatic
stare
peculiar
to
intoxicated
men
he
replied
well
what
of
that
can
t
i
have
a
little
pleasure
with
my
friends
i
came
across
a
couple
of
men
who
were
just
taking
their
fifteenth
glass
why
should
i
refuse
a
compliment
you
can
t
hold
yourself
that
s
and
to
prove
it
he
tumbled
on
to
a
chair
a
torrent
of
abuse
now
flowed
from
madame
vantrasson
s
lips
fortunat
only
imperfectly
distinguished
the
words
thief
spy
and
detective
but
he
could
not
mistake
the
meaning
of
the
looks
which
she
alternately
gave
her
husband
and
himself
it
s
a
fortunate
thing
for
you
that
my
husband
is
in
this
condition
her
glances
plainly
implied
otherwise
there
would
be
an
explanation
and
then
we
should
see
i
ve
had
a
lucky
escape
thought
the
spurious
clerk
but
as
matters
stood
there
was
nothing
to
fear
it
was
a
case
where
one
could
show
a
brave
front
to
the
enemy
without
incurring
the
slightest
danger
let
your
husband
alone
said
he
if
he
has
only
brought
the
paper
that
he
was
sent
to
fetch
i
sha
n
t
have
lost
my
evening
to
oblige
vantrasson
had
brought
not
one
sheet
of
stamped
paper
but
two
a
bad
pen
and
some
muddy
ink
were
produced
and
fortunat
began
to
draw
up
an
acknowledgment
according
to
the
established
formula
however
it
was
necessary
to
mention
the
name
of
the
creditor
of
whom
he
had
spoken
and
not
wishing
to
state
his
own
he
used
that
of
poor
victor
chupin
who
was
at
that
very
moment
shivering
at
the
door
little
suspecting
what
liberty
was
being
taken
with
his
cognomen
chupin
repeated
the
vixen
as
if
to
engrave
the
name
on
her
memory
victor
chupin
i
should
just
like
to
see
him
she
added
viciously
when
the
document
was
finished
it
became
necessary
to
wake
vantrasson
so
that
he
might
sign
it
he
did
so
with
very
good
grace
and
his
wife
appended
her
signature
beside
her
husband
s
thereupon
fortunat
gave
them
in
exchange
the
note
which
had
served
as
a
pretext
for
his
visit
and
above
all
he
remarked
as
he
opened
the
door
to
go
don
t
forget
that
you
are
to
pay
something
on
account
each
go
to
the
devil
and
your
account
with
you
growled
madame
vantrasson
but
fortunat
did
not
hear
this
he
was
already
walking
down
the
road
by
the
side
of
chupin
who
was
saying
well
here
you
are
at
last
m
sieur
i
thought
you
had
taken
a
lease
of
that
old
barrack
if
ever
i
come
here
again
i
ll
bring
a
with
but
one
of
those
fits
of
profound
abstraction
to
which
determined
seekers
after
truth
are
subject
had
taken
possession
of
fortunat
and
made
him
oblivious
of
all
surrounding
circumstances
his
heart
had
been
full
of
hope
when
he
reached
the
asnieres
road
but
he
went
away
gloomy
and
despondent
and
quite
unconscious
of
the
darkness
the
mud
and
the
rain
which
was
again
falling
he
silently
plodded
along
in
the
middle
of
the
highway
chupin
was
obliged
to
stop
him
at
the
city
gate
and
remind
him
that
the
cab
was
waiting
that
s
true
was
fortunat
s
only
answer
he
entered
the
vehicle
certainly
without
knowing
it
and
as
they
rolled
homeward
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
brain
to
overflowing
found
vent
in
a
sort
of
monologue
of
which
chupin
now
and
then
caught
a
few
words
what
a
piece
of
business
he
muttered
what
a
piece
of
business
i
ve
had
seven
years
experience
in
such
matters
and
yet
i
ve
never
met
with
an
affair
so
shrouded
in
mystery
my
forty
thousand
francs
are
in
a
precarious
condition
certainly
i
ve
lost
money
before
through
heirs
whose
existence
i
hadn
t
even
suspected
but
by
reinstating
these
same
heirs
in
their
rights
i
ve
regained
my
lost
money
and
received
a
handsome
reward
in
addition
but
in
this
case
all
is
darkness
there
isn
t
a
single
gleam
of
light
not
the
slightest
clew
if
i
could
only
find
them
but
how
can
i
search
for
people
whose
names
i
don
t
even
know
for
people
who
have
escaped
all
the
inquiries
of
the
police
and
where
shall
i
look
for
them
in
europe
in
america
it
would
be
sheer
madness
to
whom
then
will
the
count
s
millions
go
it
was
only
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
cab
in
front
of
his
own
door
that
recalled
fortunat
to
the
realities
of
life
here
are
twenty
francs
victor
he
said
to
chupin
pay
the
driver
and
keep
the
rest
as
he
spoke
he
sprang
nimbly
to
the
ground
a
handsome
brougham
drawn
by
two
horses
was
standing
before
the
house
the
marquis
de
valorsay
s
carriage
muttered
fortunat
he
has
been
very
patient
he
has
waited
for
me
or
rather
he
has
waited
for
my
ten
thousand
francs
well
we
shall
iii
fortunat
had
scarcely
started
off
on
his
visit
to
the
vantrassons
when
the
marquis
de
valorsay
reached
the
place
de
la
bourse
monsieur
has
gone
out
said
madame
dodelin
as
she
opened
the
door
you
must
be
mistaken
my
good
no
no
my
master
said
you
would
perhaps
wait
for
very
well
i
will
do
faithful
to
the
orders
she
had
received
the
servant
conducted
the
visitor
to
the
lit
the
tapers
in
the
candelabra
and
retired
this
is
very
strange
growled
the
marquis
monsieur
fortunat
makes
an
appointment
monsieur
fortunat
expects
me
to
wait
for
him
what
will
happen
next
however
he
drew
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
threw
himself
into
an
and
waited
by
his
habits
and
tastes
the
marquis
de
valorsay
belonged
to
that
section
of
the
aristocracy
which
has
coined
the
term
high
life
in
view
of
describing
its
own
manners
and
customs
the
matters
that
engrossed
the
marquis
s
frivolous
mind
were
and
first
performances
at
the
opera
and
the
leading
theatres
social
duties
and
visits
to
the
fashionable
racing
and
the
shooting
and
hunting
seasons
together
with
his
mistress
and
his
tailor
he
considered
that
to
ride
in
a
was
an
act
of
prowess
worthy
of
his
ancestors
and
when
he
galloped
past
the
stand
clad
as
a
jockey
in
and
a
violet
silk
jacket
he
believed
he
read
admiration
in
every
eye
this
was
his
life
which
had
been
enlivened
by
a
few
salient
episodes
two
duels
an
elopement
with
a
married
woman
a
hours
seance
at
the
gaming
table
and
a
fall
from
his
horse
while
hunting
which
nearly
cost
him
his
life
these
acts
of
valor
had
raised
him
considerably
in
the
estimation
of
his
friends
and
procured
him
a
celebrity
of
which
he
was
not
a
little
proud
the
newspaper
reporters
were
constantly
mentioning
his
name
and
the
sporting
journals
never
failed
to
chronicle
his
departure
from
paris
or
his
arrival
in
the
city
unfortunately
such
a
life
of
busy
idleness
has
its
trials
and
its
vicissitudes
and
de
valorsay
was
a
living
proof
of
this
he
was
only
but
in
spite
of
the
care
he
expended
upon
his
toilette
he
looked
at
least
forty
wrinkles
were
beginning
to
show
themselves
it
required
all
the
skill
of
his
valet
to
conceal
the
bald
spots
on
his
cranium
and
since
his
fall
from
his
horse
he
had
been
troubled
by
a
slight
stiffness
in
his
right
leg
which
stiffness
became
perfect
lameness
in
threatening
weather
premature
lassitude
pervaded
his
entire
person
and
when
he
relaxed
in
vigilance
even
his
eyes
betrayed
a
distaste
for
everything
weariness
satiety
as
it
were
all
the
same
however
he
bore
himself
with
an
undeniable
air
of
distinction
albeit
the
haughtiness
of
his
manner
indicated
an
exaggerated
idea
of
his
own
importance
he
was
indeed
in
the
habit
of
treating
all
those
whom
he
considered
his
inferiors
with
supercilious
sufficiency
the
clock
on
fortunat
s
struck
eleven
at
last
and
the
marquis
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
muttered
oath
this
is
too
much
he
growled
angrily
he
looked
about
for
a
bell
and
seeing
none
he
was
reduced
to
the
dire
necessity
of
opening
the
door
himself
and
calling
some
one
madame
dodelin
answered
the
summons
monsieur
said
he
would
return
before
midnight
she
replied
so
he
will
certainly
be
here
there
is
no
one
like
him
for
punctuality
won
t
monsieur
have
patience
a
little
longer
well
i
will
wait
a
few
moments
but
my
good
woman
light
the
fire
my
feet
are
frozen
fortunat
s
being
used
but
seldom
was
really
as
frigid
as
an
iceberg
and
to
make
matters
still
worse
de
valorsay
was
in
evening
dress
with
only
a
light
overcoat
the
servant
hesitated
for
an
instant
thinking
this
visitor
difficult
to
please
and
inclined
to
make
himself
very
much
at
home
still
she
obeyed
i
think
i
ought
to
go
muttered
the
marquis
i
really
think
i
ought
to
and
yet
he
remained
necessity
it
should
be
remembered
effectually
quiets
the
revolts
of
pride
left
an
orphan
in
his
early
childhood
placed
in
possession
of
an
immense
fortune
at
the
age
of
de
valorsay
had
entered
life
like
a
famished
man
enters
a
his
name
entitled
him
to
a
high
position
in
the
social
world
and
he
installed
himself
at
table
without
asking
how
much
the
banquet
might
cost
him
it
cost
him
dear
as
he
discovered
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
on
noting
that
his
disbursements
had
considerably
exceeded
his
large
income
it
was
very
evident
that
if
he
went
on
in
this
way
each
twelvemonth
would
deepen
an
abyss
where
in
the
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
left
him
by
his
father
would
finally
be
swallowed
up
but
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
reflect
upon
this
unpleasant
possibility
ere
it
could
come
to
pass
and
besides
he
found
his
present
life
so
delightful
and
he
obtained
so
much
gratification
for
his
money
that
he
was
unwilling
to
make
any
change
he
possessed
several
fine
estates
and
he
found
plenty
of
men
who
were
only
too
glad
to
lend
him
money
on
such
excellent
security
he
borrowed
timidly
at
first
but
more
boldly
when
he
discovered
what
a
mere
trifle
a
mortgage
is
moreover
his
wants
increased
in
proportion
to
his
vanity
occupying
a
certain
position
in
the
opinion
of
his
acquaintances
he
did
not
wish
to
descend
from
the
heights
to
which
they
had
exalted
him
and
the
very
fact
that
he
had
been
foolishly
extravagant
one
year
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
be
guilty
of
similar
folly
during
the
succeeding
twelvemonth
he
failed
to
pay
his
creditors
the
interest
that
was
due
on
his
loans
they
did
not
ask
him
for
it
and
perhaps
he
forgot
that
it
was
slowly
but
surely
accumulating
and
that
at
the
end
of
a
certain
number
of
years
the
amount
of
his
indebtedness
would
be
doubled
he
never
thought
what
the
end
would
be
he
became
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
condition
of
his
affairs
and
really
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
his
resources
were
inexhaustible
he
believed
this
until
one
day
when
on
going
to
his
lawyer
for
some
money
that
gentleman
coldly
said
you
requested
me
to
obtain
one
hundred
thousand
francs
for
you
monsieur
le
marquis
but
i
have
only
been
able
to
procure
fifty
thousand
here
they
are
and
do
not
hope
for
more
all
your
real
estate
is
encumbered
beyond
its
value
your
creditors
will
probably
leave
you
in
undisturbed
possession
for
another
year
it
will
be
to
their
interest
but
when
it
has
elapsed
they
will
take
possession
of
their
own
as
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
then
with
a
meaning
smile
the
smile
of
a
wily
prime
minister
he
added
if
i
were
in
your
place
monsieur
le
marquis
i
would
profit
by
this
year
of
grace
you
undoubtedly
understand
what
i
mean
i
have
the
honor
to
wish
you
what
an
awakening
after
a
glorious
dream
that
had
lasted
for
ten
years
de
valorsay
was
stunned
crushed
for
three
days
he
remained
immured
in
his
own
room
obstinately
refusing
to
receive
any
one
the
marquis
is
ill
was
his
valet
s
answer
to
every
visitor
de
valorsay
felt
that
he
must
have
time
to
regain
his
mental
equilibrium
to
look
his
situation
calmly
in
the
face
it
was
a
frightful
one
for
his
ruin
was
complete
absolute
he
could
save
nothing
from
the
wreck
what
was
to
become
of
him
what
could
he
do
he
set
his
wits
to
work
but
he
found
that
he
was
incapable
of
plying
any
kind
of
avocation
all
the
energy
he
had
been
endowed
with
by
nature
had
been
squandered
exhausted
in
pandering
to
his
if
he
had
been
younger
he
might
have
turned
soldier
but
at
his
age
he
had
not
even
this
resource
then
it
was
that
his
notary
s
smile
recurred
to
his
mind
his
advice
was
decidedly
good
he
muttered
all
is
not
yet
lost
one
way
of
escape
still
remains
and
why
indeed
shouldn
t
he
marry
and
marry
a
rich
wife
too
no
one
knew
anything
about
his
misfortune
for
a
year
at
least
he
would
retain
all
the
advantages
that
wealth
bestows
upon
its
possessor
his
name
alone
was
a
great
advantage
it
would
be
very
strange
if
he
could
not
find
some
manufacturer
s
or
banker
s
daughter
who
would
be
only
too
delighted
to
have
a
marquisial
coronet
emblazoned
on
her
carriage
panels
having
arrived
at
this
conclusion
de
valorsay
began
his
search
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
thought
he
had
found
what
he
was
seeking
but
something
was
still
necessary
the
bestowers
of
large
dowers
are
inclined
to
be
suspicious
they
like
to
have
a
clear
understanding
as
to
the
financial
position
of
the
suitors
who
present
themselves
and
they
not
unfrequently
ask
for
information
accordingly
before
committing
himself
de
valorsay
understood
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
provide
himself
with
an
intelligent
and
devoted
adviser
there
must
be
some
one
to
hold
his
creditors
in
check
to
silence
them
and
obtain
sundry
concessions
from
them
in
a
word
some
one
to
interest
them
in
his
success
with
this
object
in
view
de
valorsay
applied
to
his
notary
but
the
latter
utterly
refused
to
mix
himself
up
in
any
such
affair
and
declared
that
the
marquis
s
suggestion
was
almost
an
insult
then
touched
perhaps
by
his
client
s
apparent
despair
he
said
but
i
can
mention
a
person
who
might
be
of
service
to
you
go
to
isidore
fortunat
no
place
de
la
bourse
if
you
succeed
in
interesting
him
in
your
marriage
it
is
an
accomplished
it
was
under
these
circumstances
that
the
marquis
became
acquainted
with
fortunat
de
valorsay
was
a
man
of
no
little
penetration
and
on
his
first
visit
he
carefully
weighed
his
new
acquaintance
he
found
him
to
be
the
very
counsellor
he
desired
prudent
and
at
the
same
time
courageous
fertile
in
expedients
a
thorough
master
of
the
art
of
evading
the
law
and
not
at
all
troubled
by
scruples
with
such
an
adviser
it
would
be
mere
child
s
play
to
conceal
his
financial
embarrassments
and
deceive
the
most
suspicious
so
de
valorsay
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
he
frankly
disclosed
his
pecuniary
condition
and
his
matrimonial
hopes
and
concluded
by
promising
fortunat
a
certain
percentage
on
the
bride
s
dowry
to
be
paid
on
the
day
following
the
marriage
after
a
prolonged
conference
the
agreement
was
drawn
up
and
signed
and
that
very
day
fortunat
took
the
nobleman
s
interests
in
hand
how
heartily
and
with
what
confidence
in
his
success
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
had
advanced
forty
thousand
francs
for
his
client
s
use
out
of
his
own
private
purse
after
such
a
proof
of
confidence
the
marquis
could
hardly
have
been
dissatisfied
with
his
adviser
in
point
of
fact
he
was
delighted
with
him
and
all
the
more
so
as
this
invaluable
man
always
treated
him
with
extreme
deference
verging
on
servility
and
in
de
valorsay
s
eyes
this
was
a
great
consideration
for
he
was
becoming
more
arrogant
and
more
irascible
in
proportion
as
his
right
to
be
so
diminished
secretly
disgusted
with
himself
and
deeply
humiliated
by
the
shameful
intrigue
to
which
he
had
stooped
he
took
a
secret
satisfaction
in
crushing
his
accomplice
with
his
imaginary
superiority
and
lordly
disdain
according
as
his
humor
was
good
or
bad
he
called
him
my
dear
extortioner
mons
fortunat
or
master
but
though
these
sneers
and
insults
drove
the
obsequious
smile
from
fortunat
s
lips
he
was
quite
capable
of
including
them
in
the
bill
under
the
head
of
sundries
the
unvarying
deference
and
submission
which
de
valorsay
s
adviser
displayed
made
his
failure
to
keep
the
present
appointment
all
the
more
remarkable
such
neglect
of
the
commonest
rules
of
courtesy
was
inconceivable
on
the
part
of
so
polite
a
man
and
the
marquis
s
anger
gradually
changed
to
anxiety
what
can
have
happened
he
thought
he
was
trying
to
decide
whether
he
should
leave
or
stay
when
he
heard
a
key
grate
in
the
lock
of
the
outer
door
and
then
some
quick
steps
along
the
at
last
here
he
is
he
muttered
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
expected
to
see
fortunat
enter
the
room
at
once
but
he
was
disappointed
the
agent
had
no
desire
to
show
himself
in
the
garb
which
he
had
assumed
for
his
excursion
with
chupin
and
so
he
had
hastened
to
his
room
to
don
his
wonted
habiliments
he
also
desired
a
few
moments
for
deliberation
if
as
was
most
probably
the
case
de
valorsay
were
ignorant
of
the
count
de
chalusse
s
critical
condition
was
it
advisable
to
tell
him
of
it
fortunat
thought
not
judging
with
reason
that
this
would
lead
to
a
discussion
and
very
possibly
to
a
rupture
and
he
wished
to
avoid
anything
of
the
kind
until
he
was
quite
certain
of
the
count
s
death
meanwhile
the
marquis
was
thinking
he
was
a
trifle
late
about
it
that
he
had
done
wrong
to
wait
in
that
for
three
mortal
hours
was
such
conduct
worthy
of
him
had
he
shown
himself
proper
respect
would
not
fortunat
construe
this
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
importance
of
his
services
and
his
client
s
urgent
need
would
he
not
become
more
exacting
more
exorbitant
in
his
demands
if
the
marquis
could
have
made
his
escape
unheard
he
would
no
doubt
have
done
so
but
this
was
out
of
the
question
so
he
resorted
to
a
stratagem
which
seemed
to
him
likely
to
save
his
compromised
dignity
he
stretched
himself
out
in
his
closed
his
eyes
and
pretended
to
doze
then
when
fortunat
at
last
entered
the
he
sprang
up
as
if
he
were
suddenly
aroused
from
slumber
rubbed
his
eyes
and
exclaimed
eh
what
s
that
upon
my
word
i
must
have
been
asleep
but
fortunat
was
not
deceived
he
noticed
on
the
floor
a
torn
and
crumpled
newspaper
which
betrayed
the
impatience
and
anger
his
client
had
experienced
during
his
long
waiting
well
resumed
the
marquis
what
time
is
it
twelve
this
is
a
pretty
time
to
keep
an
appointment
fixed
for
ten
o
clock
this
is
presuming
on
my
fortunat
do
you
know
that
my
carriage
has
been
waiting
below
ever
since
nine
and
that
my
horses
have
perhaps
taken
cold
a
pair
of
horses
worth
six
hundred
louis
fortunat
listened
to
these
reproaches
with
the
deepest
humility
you
must
excuse
me
monsieur
le
marquis
said
he
if
i
remained
out
so
much
later
than
usual
it
was
only
because
your
business
interests
detained
zounds
that
is
about
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
your
own
business
that
detained
you
and
well
pleased
with
this
joke
he
added
ah
well
how
are
affairs
progressing
on
my
side
as
well
as
could
be
the
marquis
had
resumed
his
seat
in
the
and
was
poking
the
fire
with
a
haughty
but
poorly
assumed
air
of
indifference
i
am
listening
he
said
carelessly
in
that
case
monsieur
le
marquis
i
will
state
the
facts
in
a
few
words
without
going
into
particulars
thanks
to
an
expedient
devised
by
me
we
shall
obtain
for
twenty
hours
a
release
from
all
the
mortgages
that
now
encumber
your
estates
on
that
very
day
we
will
request
a
certificate
from
the
recorder
this
certificate
will
declare
that
your
estates
are
free
from
all
encumbrances
you
will
show
this
statement
to
de
chalusse
and
all
his
doubts
that
is
if
he
has
any
will
vanish
the
plan
was
very
simple
the
only
difficulty
was
about
raising
the
money
but
i
have
succeeded
in
doing
so
all
your
creditors
but
two
lent
themselves
very
readily
to
the
arrangement
i
have
now
won
the
consent
of
the
two
who
at
first
refused
but
we
shall
have
to
pay
dearly
for
it
it
will
cost
you
about
thousand
de
valorsay
was
so
delighted
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
clapping
his
hands
then
the
affair
is
virtually
concluded
he
exclaimed
in
less
than
a
month
mademoiselle
marguerite
will
be
the
marquise
de
valorsay
and
i
shall
have
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
then
noting
how
gravely
fortunat
shook
his
head
ah
so
you
doubt
it
he
cried
very
well
now
it
is
your
turn
to
listen
yesterday
i
had
a
long
conference
with
the
count
de
chalusse
and
everything
has
been
settled
we
exchanged
our
word
of
honor
master
the
count
does
things
in
a
princely
fashion
he
gives
mademoiselle
marguerite
two
two
millions
the
other
repeated
like
an
echo
yes
my
dear
miser
neither
more
nor
less
only
for
private
reasons
which
he
did
not
explain
the
count
stipulates
that
only
two
hundred
thousand
francs
shall
appear
in
the
marriage
contract
the
remaining
eighteen
hundred
thousand
francs
he
gives
to
me
unreservedly
and
unconditionally
upon
my
word
i
think
this
very
charming
how
does
it
strike
you
fortunat
made
no
reply
de
valorsay
s
gayety
instead
of
cheering
saddened
him
ah
my
fine
fellow
he
thought
you
would
sing
a
different
song
if
you
knew
that
by
this
time
de
chalusse
is
probably
dead
and
that
most
likely
mademoiselle
marguerite
has
only
her
beautiful
eyes
left
her
and
will
dim
them
in
weeping
for
her
vanished
but
this
brilliant
scion
of
the
aristocracy
had
no
suspicion
of
the
real
state
of
affairs
for
he
continued
you
will
say
perhaps
it
is
strange
that
i
robert
dalbou
marquis
de
valorsay
should
marry
a
girl
whose
father
and
mother
no
one
knows
and
whose
only
name
is
marguerite
in
this
respect
it
is
true
that
the
match
is
not
exactly
a
brilliant
one
still
as
it
will
appear
that
she
merely
has
a
fortune
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
no
one
will
accuse
me
of
marrying
for
money
on
the
strength
of
my
name
on
the
contrary
it
will
seem
to
be
a
and
people
will
suppose
that
i
have
grown
young
he
paused
incensed
by
fortunat
s
lack
of
enthusiasm
judging
from
your
long
face
master
one
would
fancy
you
doubted
my
success
he
said
it
is
always
best
to
doubt
replied
his
adviser
philosophically
the
marquis
shrugged
his
shoulders
even
when
one
has
triumphed
over
all
obstacles
he
asked
sneeringly
then
tell
me
if
you
please
what
prevents
this
marriage
from
being
a
foregone
conclusion
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
consent
monsieur
le
it
was
as
if
a
glass
of
had
been
thrown
in
de
valorsay
s
face
he
started
turned
as
pale
as
death
and
then
exclaimed
i
shall
have
that
i
am
sure
of
you
could
not
say
that
fortunat
was
angry
such
a
man
as
cold
and
as
smooth
as
a
hundred
franc
piece
has
no
useless
passions
but
he
was
intensely
irritated
to
hear
his
client
foolishly
chanting
the
paeons
of
victory
while
he
was
compelled
to
conceal
his
grief
at
the
loss
of
his
forty
thousand
francs
deep
in
the
recesses
of
his
heart
so
far
from
being
touched
by
the
marquis
s
evident
alarm
it
pleased
him
to
be
able
to
turn
the
dagger
in
the
wound
he
had
just
inflicted
you
must
excuse
my
incredulity
said
he
it
comes
entirely
from
something
you
yourself
told
me
about
a
week
what
did
i
tell
you
that
you
suspected
mademoiselle
marguerite
of
a
how
shall
i
express
it
of
a
secret
preference
for
some
other
the
gloomiest
despondency
had
now
followed
the
marquis
s
enthusiasm
and
exultation
he
was
evidently
in
torture
i
more
than
suspected
it
said
he
ah
i
was
certain
of
it
thanks
to
the
count
s
madame
leon
a
miserable
old
woman
whom
i
have
hired
to
look
after
my
interests
she
has
been
watching
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
saw
a
letter
written
by
her
oh
certainly
nothing
has
passed
that
mademoiselle
marguerite
has
any
cause
to
blush
for
the
letter
which
is
now
in
my
possession
contains
unmistakable
proofs
of
that
she
might
proudly
avow
the
love
she
has
inspired
and
which
she
undoubtedly
returns
yet
fortunat
s
gaze
was
so
intent
that
it
became
unbearable
you
see
then
he
began
that
i
had
good
cause
to
exasperated
beyond
endurance
de
valorsay
sprang
up
so
violently
that
he
overturned
his
chair
no
he
exclaimed
no
a
thousand
times
no
you
are
wrong
for
the
man
who
loves
mademoiselle
marguerite
is
now
ruined
yes
such
is
really
the
case
while
we
are
sitting
here
at
this
very
moment
he
is
lost
irredeemably
lost
between
him
and
the
woman
whom
i
wish
to
marry
whom
i
shall
marry
i
have
dug
so
broad
and
deep
an
abyss
that
the
strongest
love
can
not
overleap
it
it
is
better
and
worse
than
if
i
had
killed
him
dead
he
would
have
been
mourned
perhaps
while
now
the
lowest
and
most
degraded
woman
would
turn
from
him
in
disgust
or
even
if
she
loved
him
she
would
not
dare
to
confess
fortunat
seemed
greatly
disturbed
have
you
then
put
into
execution
the
project
the
plan
you
spoke
of
he
faltered
i
thought
you
were
only
the
marquis
lowered
his
head
yes
he
answered
his
companion
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
petrified
and
then
suddenly
exclaimed
what
you
have
done
that
you
a
gentleman
de
valorsay
paced
the
floor
in
a
state
of
intense
agitation
had
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
own
face
in
the
it
would
have
frightened
him
a
gentleman
he
repeated
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
rage
a
gentleman
that
word
is
in
everybody
s
mouth
nowadays
pray
what
do
you
understand
by
a
gentleman
mons
fortunat
no
doubt
you
mean
a
heroic
idiot
who
passed
through
life
with
a
lofty
mien
clad
in
all
the
virtues
as
stoical
as
job
and
as
resigned
as
a
martyr
a
sort
of
moral
don
quixote
preaching
the
austerest
virtue
and
practising
it
but
unfortunately
nobility
of
soul
and
of
purpose
are
expensive
luxuries
and
i
am
a
ruined
man
i
am
no
saint
i
love
life
and
all
that
makes
life
beautiful
and
desirable
and
to
procure
its
pleasures
i
must
fight
with
the
weapons
of
the
age
no
doubt
it
is
grand
to
be
honest
but
in
my
case
it
is
so
impossible
that
i
prefer
to
be
dishonest
to
commit
an
act
of
shameful
infamy
which
will
yield
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
this
man
is
in
my
way
i
suppress
him
so
much
the
worse
for
him
he
has
no
business
to
be
in
my
way
if
i
could
have
met
him
openly
i
would
have
dispatched
him
according
to
the
accepted
code
of
honor
but
then
i
should
have
had
to
renounce
all
idea
of
marrying
mademoiselle
marguerite
so
i
was
obliged
to
find
some
other
way
i
could
not
choose
my
means
the
drowning
man
does
not
reject
the
plank
which
is
his
only
chance
of
salvation
because
it
chances
to
be
his
gestures
were
even
more
forcible
than
his
words
and
when
he
concluded
he
threw
himself
on
to
the
sofa
holding
his
head
tightly
between
his
hands
as
if
he
felt
that
it
was
bursting
anger
choked
his
utterance
not
anger
so
much
as
something
he
would
not
confess
the
quickening
of
his
own
conscience
and
the
revolt
of
every
honorable
instinct
for
in
spite
of
his
sins
of
omission
and
of
commission
never
until
this
day
had
he
actually
violated
any
clause
of
the
code
acknowledged
by
men
of
honor
you
have
been
guilty
of
a
most
infamous
act
monsieur
le
marquis
said
fortunat
coldly
oh
no
moralizing
if
you
only
evil
will
come
of
the
marquis
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
in
a
tone
of
bitter
scorn
retorted
come
mons
fortunat
if
you
wish
to
lose
the
forty
thousand
francs
you
advanced
to
me
it
s
easy
enough
to
do
so
run
to
madame
d
argeles
s
house
ask
for
de
coralth
and
tell
him
i
countermand
my
order
my
rival
will
be
saved
and
will
marry
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
her
fortunat
remained
silent
he
could
not
tell
the
marquis
my
forty
thousand
francs
are
lost
already
i
know
that
only
too
well
mademoiselle
marguerite
is
no
longer
the
possessor
of
millions
and
you
have
committed
a
useless
however
it
was
this
conviction
which
imparted
such
an
accent
of
eagerness
to
his
words
as
he
continued
to
plead
the
cause
of
virtue
and
of
honesty
would
he
have
said
as
much
if
he
had
entertained
any
great
hope
of
the
success
of
the
marquis
s
matrimonial
enterprise
it
is
doubtful
still
we
must
do
fortunat
the
justice
to
admit
that
he
was
really
and
sincerely
horrified
by
what
he
had
unhesitatingly
styled
an
infamous
the
marquis
listened
to
his
agent
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
and
then
rose
to
his
feet
again
all
this
is
very
true
he
interrupted
but
i
am
nevertheless
anxious
to
learn
the
result
of
my
little
plot
for
this
reason
monsieur
fortunat
give
me
at
once
the
five
hundred
louis
you
promised
me
and
i
will
then
bid
you
the
agent
had
been
preparing
himself
for
this
moment
and
yet
he
trembled
i
am
deeply
grieved
monsieur
he
replied
with
a
doleful
smile
it
was
this
matter
that
kept
me
out
so
much
later
than
usual
this
evening
i
hoped
to
have
obtained
the
money
from
a
banker
who
has
always
accommodated
me
before
prosper
bertomy
you
know
him
he
married
andre
fauvel
s
niece
yes
i
know
proceed
if
you
ah
well
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
procure
the
the
marquis
had
hitherto
been
pale
but
now
his
face
flushed
crimson
this
is
a
jest
i
suppose
said
he
alas
unfortunately
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
which
the
marquis
probably
spent
in
reflecting
upon
the
probable
consequences
of
this
disappointment
for
it
was
in
an
almost
threatening
tone
that
he
eventually
exclaimed
you
know
that
i
must
have
this
money
at
once
that
i
must
have
fortunat
would
certainly
have
preferred
to
lose
a
good
pound
of
flesh
rather
than
the
sum
of
money
mentioned
but
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
that
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
sever
his
connection
with
his
client
until
the
death
of
the
count
de
chalusse
was
certain
and
being
anxious
to
save
his
money
and
to
keep
his
client
his
embarrassment
was
extreme
it
was
the
most
unfortunate
thing
in
the
world
he
stammered
i
apprehended
no
difficulty
whatever
then
suddenly
clapping
his
hand
to
his
forehead
he
exclaimed
but
monsieur
le
marquis
couldn
t
you
borrow
this
amount
from
one
of
your
friends
the
duke
de
champdoce
or
the
count
de
commarin
that
would
be
a
good
de
valorsay
was
anything
but
unsophisticated
and
his
natural
shrewdness
had
been
rendered
much
more
acute
by
the
difficulties
with
which
he
had
recently
been
obliged
to
contend
fortunat
s
confusion
had
not
escaped
his
keen
glance
and
this
last
suggestion
aroused
his
suspicions
at
once
what
he
said
slowly
and
with
an
air
of
evident
distrust
you
give
me
this
advice
master
this
is
wonderful
how
long
is
it
since
your
opinions
have
undergone
such
a
change
my
opinions
yes
didn
t
you
say
to
me
during
our
first
interview
the
thing
that
will
save
you
is
that
you
have
never
in
your
whole
life
borrowed
a
louis
from
a
friend
an
ordinary
creditor
only
thinks
of
a
large
interest
and
if
that
is
paid
him
he
holds
his
peace
a
friend
is
never
satisfied
until
everybody
knows
that
he
has
generously
obliged
you
it
is
far
better
to
apply
to
a
i
thought
all
that
very
sensible
and
i
quite
agreed
with
you
when
you
added
so
monsieur
le
marquis
no
borrowing
of
this
kind
until
after
your
marriage
not
on
any
pretext
whatever
go
without
eating
rather
than
do
it
your
credit
is
still
good
but
it
is
being
slowly
undermined
and
the
indiscretion
of
a
friend
who
chanced
to
say
i
think
valorsay
is
hard
up
might
fire
the
train
and
then
you
d
fortunat
s
embarrassment
was
really
painful
to
witness
he
was
not
usually
wanting
in
courage
but
the
events
of
the
evening
had
shaken
his
confidence
and
his
composure
the
hope
of
gain
and
the
fear
of
loss
had
deprived
him
of
his
wonted
clearness
of
mind
feeling
that
he
had
just
committed
a
terrible
blunder
he
racked
his
brain
to
find
some
way
of
repairing
it
and
finding
none
his
confusion
increased
did
you
or
didn
t
you
use
that
language
insisted
de
valorsay
what
have
you
to
say
in
reply
circumstances
what
circumstances
urgent
need
necessity
there
is
no
rule
without
its
exceptions
i
did
not
imagine
you
would
be
so
rash
i
have
advanced
you
forty
thousand
francs
in
less
than
five
months
it
is
outrageous
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
be
more
reasonable
i
would
economize
he
paused
in
fact
he
was
compelled
to
pause
by
the
piercing
glance
which
de
valorsay
turned
upon
him
he
was
furious
with
himself
i
am
losing
my
wits
he
thought
still
more
wise
counsel
remarked
the
ruined
nobleman
ironically
while
you
are
about
it
why
don
t
you
advise
me
to
sell
my
horses
and
carriages
and
establish
myself
in
a
garret
in
the
rue
amelot
such
a
course
would
seem
very
natural
wouldn
t
it
and
of
course
it
would
inspire
de
chalusse
with
boundless
confidence
but
without
going
to
such
extremes
hold
your
tongue
interrupted
the
marquis
violently
better
than
any
one
else
you
know
that
i
can
not
retrench
although
the
reality
no
longer
exists
i
am
condemned
cost
what
it
may
to
keep
up
appearances
that
is
my
only
hope
of
salvation
i
have
gambled
given
expensive
suppers
indulged
in
dissipation
of
every
kind
and
i
must
continue
to
do
so
i
have
come
to
hate
ninette
simplon
for
whom
i
have
committed
so
many
acts
of
folly
and
yet
i
still
keep
her
to
show
that
i
am
rolling
in
wealth
i
have
thrown
notes
out
of
the
window
and
i
mustn
t
stop
throwing
them
indeed
what
would
people
say
if
i
stopped
why
valorsay
is
a
ruined
man
then
farewell
to
my
hopes
of
marrying
an
heiress
and
so
i
am
always
gay
and
smiling
that
is
part
of
my
role
what
would
my
servants
the
twenty
spies
that
i
pay
what
would
they
think
if
they
saw
me
thoughtful
or
disturbed
you
would
scarcely
believe
it
fortunat
but
i
have
positively
been
reduced
to
dining
on
credit
at
my
club
because
i
had
paid
that
morning
for
a
month
s
provender
for
my
horses
it
is
true
i
have
many
valuable
articles
in
my
house
but
i
can
not
dispose
of
them
people
would
recognize
them
at
once
besides
they
form
a
part
of
my
an
actor
doesn
t
sell
his
costumes
because
he
s
hungry
he
goes
without
food
and
when
it
s
time
for
the
curtain
to
rise
he
dons
his
satin
and
velvet
garments
and
despite
his
empty
stomach
he
chants
the
praises
of
a
bountiful
table
and
rare
old
wine
that
is
what
i
am
doing
i
robert
dalbou
marquis
de
valorsay
at
the
races
at
vincennes
about
a
fortnight
ago
i
was
bowling
along
the
boulevard
behind
my
when
i
heard
a
laborer
say
how
happy
those
rich
people
must
be
happy
indeed
why
i
envied
him
his
lot
he
was
sure
that
the
morrow
would
be
like
the
day
that
preceded
it
on
that
occasion
my
entire
fortune
consisted
of
a
single
louis
which
i
had
won
at
baccarat
the
evening
before
as
i
entered
the
enclosure
isabelle
the
handed
me
a
rose
for
my
i
gave
her
my
louis
but
i
longed
to
strangle
her
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
in
a
frenzy
of
passion
he
advanced
toward
fortunat
who
instinctively
retreated
into
the
protecting
embrasure
of
a
window
and
for
eight
months
i
have
lived
this
horrible
life
he
resumed
for
eight
months
each
moment
has
been
so
much
torture
ah
better
poverty
prison
and
shame
and
now
when
the
prize
is
almost
won
actuated
either
by
treason
or
caprice
you
try
to
make
all
my
toil
and
all
my
suffering
unavailing
you
try
to
thwart
me
on
the
very
threshold
of
success
no
i
swear
by
god
s
sacred
name
it
shall
not
be
i
will
rather
crush
you
you
miserable
scoundrel
crush
you
like
a
venomous
reptile
there
was
such
a
ring
of
fury
in
his
voice
that
the
crystals
of
the
candelabra
vibrated
and
madame
dodelin
in
her
kitchen
heard
it
and
shuddered
some
one
will
certainly
do
fortunat
an
injury
one
of
these
days
she
thought
it
was
not
by
any
means
the
first
time
that
fortunat
had
found
himself
at
variance
with
clients
of
a
sanguine
temperament
but
he
had
always
escaped
safe
and
sound
so
that
after
all
he
was
not
particularly
alarmed
in
the
present
instance
as
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
he
was
still
calm
enough
to
reflect
and
plan
in
hours
i
shall
be
certain
of
the
count
s
fate
he
thought
he
will
be
dead
or
he
will
be
in
a
fair
way
to
recovery
so
by
promising
to
give
this
frenzied
man
what
he
desires
on
the
day
after
i
shall
incur
no
taking
advantage
of
an
opportunity
which
de
valorsay
furnished
on
pausing
to
draw
breath
he
hastily
exclaimed
really
monsieur
le
marquis
i
can
not
understand
your
what
scoundrel
excuse
me
before
insulting
me
permit
me
to
explain
no
explanation
five
hundred
louis
have
the
kindness
to
allow
me
to
finish
yes
i
know
that
you
are
in
urgent
need
of
money
not
but
now
i
was
unable
to
procure
it
nor
can
i
promise
it
but
on
the
day
after
saturday
i
shall
certainly
have
it
ready
for
the
marquis
seemed
to
be
trying
to
read
his
agent
s
very
soul
are
you
in
earnest
he
asked
show
your
hand
if
you
don
t
intend
to
help
me
out
of
my
embarrassment
say
ah
monsieur
le
marquis
am
i
not
as
much
interested
in
your
success
as
you
yourself
can
be
have
you
not
received
abundant
proofs
of
my
devotion
then
i
can
rely
upon
and
seeing
a
lingering
doubt
in
his
client
s
eyes
fortunat
added
you
have
my
word
of
honor
the
clock
struck
three
the
marquis
took
his
hat
and
started
toward
the
door
but
fortunat
in
whose
heart
the
word
scoundrel
was
still
rankling
stopped
him
are
you
going
to
that
lady
s
house
now
what
is
she
called
i
ve
forgotten
her
name
ah
yes
i
remember
now
madame
d
argeles
isn
t
she
called
it
s
at
her
place
i
believe
that
the
reputation
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
favored
lover
is
to
be
the
marquis
turned
angrily
what
do
you
take
me
for
master
he
rudely
asked
that
is
one
of
those
things
no
gentleman
will
do
himself
but
in
paris
people
can
be
found
to
do
any
kind
of
dirty
work
if
you
are
willing
to
pay
them
for
then
how
will
you
know
the
result
why
twenty
minutes
after
the
affair
is
over
de
coralth
will
be
at
my
house
he
is
there
even
now
and
as
this
subject
was
anything
but
pleasant
he
hastened
away
exclaiming
get
to
bed
my
dear
extortioner
au
revoir
and
above
all
remember
your
my
respects
monsieur
le
but
when
the
door
closed
fortunat
s
expression
immediately
changed
ah
you
insult
me
he
muttered
sullenly
you
rob
me
and
you
call
me
a
scoundrel
into
the
bargain
you
shall
pay
dearly
for
it
my
fine
fellow
no
matter
what
may
happen
iv
it
is
in
vain
that
the
law
has
endeavored
to
shield
private
life
from
prying
eyes
the
scribes
who
pander
to
parisian
curiosity
surmount
all
obstacles
and
brave
every
danger
thanks
to
the
high
life
reporters
every
newspaper
reader
is
aware
that
twice
a
week
mondays
and
thursdays
madame
lia
d
argeles
holds
a
reception
at
her
charming
mansion
in
the
rue
de
berry
her
guests
find
plenty
of
amusement
there
they
seldom
dance
but
begins
at
midnight
and
a
dainty
supper
is
served
before
the
departure
of
the
guests
it
was
on
leaving
one
of
these
little
entertainments
that
that
unfortunate
young
man
jules
chazel
a
cashier
in
a
large
committed
suicide
by
blowing
out
his
brains
the
brilliant
frequenters
of
madame
d
argeles
s
entertainments
considered
this
act
proof
of
exceeding
bad
taste
and
deplorable
weakness
on
his
part
the
fellow
was
a
coward
they
declared
why
he
had
lost
hardly
a
thousand
louis
he
had
lost
only
that
it
is
true
a
mere
trifle
as
times
go
only
the
money
was
not
his
he
had
taken
it
from
the
safe
which
was
confided
to
his
keeping
expecting
probably
to
double
the
amount
in
a
single
night
in
the
morning
when
he
found
himself
alone
without
a
penny
and
the
deficit
staring
him
in
the
face
the
voice
of
conscience
cried
you
are
a
thief
and
he
lost
his
reason
the
event
created
a
great
sensation
at
the
time
and
the
petit
journal
published
a
curious
story
concerning
this
unfortunate
young
man
s
mother
the
poor
woman
she
was
a
widow
sold
all
she
possessed
even
the
bed
on
which
she
slept
and
when
she
had
succeeded
in
gathering
together
twenty
thousand
francs
the
ransom
of
her
son
s
honor
she
carried
them
to
the
banker
by
whom
her
boy
had
been
employed
he
took
them
without
even
asking
the
mother
if
she
had
enough
left
to
purchase
her
dinner
that
evening
and
the
fine
gentleman
who
had
won
and
pocketed
jules
chazel
s
stolen
gold
thought
the
banker
s
conduct
perfectly
natural
and
just
it
is
true
that
madame
d
argeles
was
in
despair
during
hours
or
so
for
the
police
had
begun
a
sort
of
investigation
and
she
feared
this
might
frighten
her
visitors
and
empty
her
not
at
all
however
on
the
contrary
she
had
good
cause
to
congratulate
herself
upon
the
notoriety
she
gained
through
this
suicide
for
five
days
she
was
the
talk
of
paris
and
alfred
d
aunay
even
published
her
portrait
in
the
illustrated
chronicle
still
no
one
was
able
to
say
exactly
who
madame
lia
d
argeles
was
who
was
she
and
whence
did
she
come
how
had
she
lived
until
she
sprang
up
full
grown
in
the
sunshine
of
the
fashionable
world
did
the
splendid
mansion
in
the
rue
de
berry
really
belong
to
her
was
she
as
rich
as
she
was
supposed
to
be
where
had
she
acquired
such
manners
the
manners
of
a
thorough
woman
of
the
world
with
her
many
accomplishments
as
well
as
her
remarkable
skill
as
a
musician
everything
connected
with
her
was
a
subject
of
conjecture
even
to
the
name
inscribed
upon
her
visiting
cards
lia
d
but
no
matter
her
house
was
always
filled
to
and
at
the
very
moment
when
the
marquis
de
valorsay
and
fortunat
were
speaking
of
her
a
dozen
coroneted
carriages
stood
before
her
door
and
her
rooms
were
thronged
with
guests
it
was
a
little
past
midnight
and
the
card
party
had
just
been
made
up
when
a
footman
announced
monsieur
le
vicomte
de
coralth
monsieur
pascal
ferailleur
few
of
the
players
deigned
to
raise
their
heads
but
one
man
growled
good
two
more
players
and
four
or
five
young
men
exclaimed
ah
here
s
ferdinand
good
evening
my
dear
fellow
de
coralth
was
very
young
and
remarkably
almost
too
indeed
for
his
handsomeness
was
somewhat
startling
and
unnatural
he
had
an
exceedingly
fair
complexion
and
large
melting
black
eyes
while
a
woman
might
have
envied
him
his
wavy
brown
hair
and
the
exquisite
delicacy
of
his
skin
he
dressed
with
great
care
and
taste
and
even
coquettishly
his
collar
left
his
firm
white
throat
uncovered
and
his
gloves
fitted
as
perfectly
as
the
skin
upon
his
soft
delicate
hands
he
bowed
familiarly
on
entering
and
with
a
rather
complacent
smile
on
his
lips
he
approached
madame
d
argeles
who
half
reclining
in
an
easy
chair
near
the
was
conversing
with
two
elderly
gentlemen
of
grave
and
distinguished
bearing
how
late
you
are
viscount
she
remarked
carelessly
what
have
you
been
doing
i
fancied
i
saw
you
in
the
bois
in
the
marquis
de
valorsay
s
a
slight
flush
suffused
de
coralth
s
cheeks
and
to
hide
it
perhaps
he
turned
toward
the
visitor
who
had
entered
with
him
and
drew
him
toward
madame
d
argeles
saying
allow
me
madame
to
present
to
you
one
of
my
great
friends
pascal
ferailleur
an
advocate
whose
name
will
be
known
to
fame
some
your
friends
are
always
welcome
at
my
house
my
dear
viscount
replied
madame
d
argeles
and
before
pascal
had
concluded
his
bow
she
averted
her
head
and
resumed
her
interrupted
conversation
the
however
was
worthy
of
more
than
that
cursory
notice
he
was
a
young
man
of
five
or
and
tall
each
movement
of
his
person
was
imbued
with
that
natural
grace
which
is
the
result
of
perfect
harmony
of
the
muscles
and
of
more
than
common
vigor
his
features
were
irregular
but
they
gave
evidence
of
energy
kindness
of
heart
and
honesty
of
purpose
a
man
possessing
such
a
proud
intelligent
and
open
brow
such
a
clear
straightforward
gaze
and
such
lips
could
be
no
ordinary
one
deserted
by
his
sponsor
who
was
shaking
hands
right
and
left
he
seated
himself
on
a
sofa
a
little
in
the
background
not
because
he
was
embarrassed
but
because
he
felt
that
instinctive
distrust
of
self
which
frequently
seizes
hold
of
a
person
on
entering
a
crowd
of
strangers
he
did
his
best
to
conceal
his
curiosity
but
nevertheless
he
looked
and
listened
with
all
his
might
the
salon
was
an
immense
apartment
divided
into
two
rooms
by
sliding
doors
and
hangings
when
madame
d
argeles
gave
a
ball
the
rooms
were
thrown
into
one
but
as
a
general
rule
one
room
was
occupied
by
the
and
the
other
served
as
a
refuge
for
those
who
wished
to
chat
the
into
which
pascal
had
been
ushered
was
an
apartment
of
noble
proportions
furnished
in
a
style
of
tasteful
magnificence
the
tints
of
the
carpet
were
subdued
there
was
not
too
much
gilding
on
the
cornices
the
clock
upon
the
was
chaste
and
elegant
in
design
the
only
thing
at
all
peculiar
about
the
room
and
its
appointments
was
a
reflector
ingeniously
arranged
above
the
chandelier
in
such
a
way
as
to
throw
the
full
glare
of
the
candles
upon
the
which
stood
directly
beneath
it
the
table
itself
was
adorned
with
a
rich
tapestry
cover
but
this
was
visible
only
at
the
corners
for
it
was
covered
in
turn
with
a
green
baize
cloth
considerably
the
worse
for
wear
madame
d
argeles
s
guests
were
probably
not
over
fifty
in
number
but
they
all
seemed
to
belong
to
the
very
best
society
the
majority
of
them
were
men
of
forty
or
thereabouts
several
wore
decorations
and
two
or
three
of
the
eldest
were
treated
with
marked
deference
certain
names
which
pascal
overheard
surprised
him
greatly
what
these
men
here
he
said
to
himself
and
i
i
regarded
my
visit
as
a
sort
of
clandestine
there
were
only
seven
or
eight
ladies
present
none
of
them
being
especially
attractive
their
toilettes
were
very
costly
but
in
rather
doubtful
taste
and
they
wore
a
profusion
of
diamonds
pascal
noticed
that
these
ladies
were
treated
with
perfect
indifference
and
that
whenever
the
gentlemen
spoke
to
them
they
assumed
an
air
of
politeness
which
was
too
exaggerated
not
to
be
ironical
a
score
of
persons
were
seated
at
the
and
the
guests
who
had
retired
into
the
adjoining
salon
were
silently
watching
the
progress
of
the
game
or
quietly
chatting
in
the
corners
of
the
room
it
surprised
him
to
note
that
every
one
spoke
in
very
low
tones
there
was
something
very
like
respect
even
awe
in
this
subdued
murmur
one
might
have
supposed
that
those
present
were
celebrating
the
rites
of
some
mysterious
worship
and
is
not
gaming
a
species
of
idolatry
symbolized
by
cards
and
which
has
its
images
its
fetishes
its
miracles
its
fanatics
and
its
martyrs
occasionally
above
the
accompaniment
of
whispers
rose
the
strange
and
incoherent
exclamations
of
the
players
here
are
twenty
louis
i
take
it
i
pass
the
play
is
made
banco
what
a
strange
gathering
thought
pascal
ferailleur
what
singular
people
and
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
as
if
he
hoped
to
decipher
the
solution
of
the
enigma
on
her
face
but
madame
lia
d
argeles
defied
all
analysis
she
was
one
of
those
women
whose
uncertain
age
varies
according
to
their
mood
between
the
thirties
and
the
fifties
one
who
did
not
look
over
thirty
in
the
evening
but
who
would
have
been
charged
with
being
more
than
fifty
the
next
morning
in
her
youth
she
must
have
been
very
beautiful
and
she
was
still
though
she
had
grown
somewhat
stout
and
her
face
had
become
a
trifle
heavy
thus
marring
the
symmetry
of
her
very
delicate
features
a
perfect
blonde
she
had
eyes
of
so
clear
a
blue
that
they
seemed
almost
faded
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
was
so
unnatural
that
it
almost
startled
one
it
was
the
dull
lifeless
white
which
suggests
an
excessive
use
of
cosmetics
and
rice
powder
and
long
baths
late
hours
and
sleep
at
in
a
darkened
room
her
face
was
utterly
devoid
of
expression
one
might
have
fancied
that
its
muscles
had
become
relaxed
after
terrible
efforts
to
feign
or
to
conceal
some
violent
emotions
and
there
was
something
melancholy
almost
terrifying
in
the
eternal
and
perhaps
involuntary
smile
which
curved
her
lips
she
wore
a
dress
of
black
velvet
with
slashed
sleeves
and
bodice
a
new
design
of
the
famous
van
klopen
pascal
was
engaged
in
these
observations
when
de
coralth
having
made
his
round
came
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
beside
him
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
inquired
upon
my
word
replied
the
young
advocate
i
am
infinitely
obliged
to
you
for
inviting
me
to
accompany
you
here
i
am
intensely
good
my
philosopher
is
not
captivated
but
interested
i
then
in
the
tone
of
which
was
habitual
to
him
he
added
as
for
being
the
sage
you
call
me
that
s
all
nonsense
and
to
prove
it
i
m
going
to
risk
my
louis
with
the
de
coralth
seemed
amazed
but
a
close
observer
might
have
detected
a
gleam
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
you
are
going
to
play
you
yes
why
not
take
care
of
what
pray
the
worst
i
can
do
is
to
lose
what
i
have
in
my
pocket
something
over
two
hundred
the
viscount
shook
his
head
thoughtfully
it
isn
t
that
which
one
has
cause
to
fear
the
devil
always
has
a
hand
in
this
business
and
the
first
time
a
man
plays
he
s
sure
to
and
is
that
a
misfortune
yes
because
the
recollection
of
these
first
winnings
is
sure
to
lure
you
back
to
the
again
you
go
back
you
lose
you
try
to
recover
your
money
and
that
s
the
end
of
it
you
become
a
pascal
ferailleur
s
smile
was
the
smile
of
a
man
who
has
full
confidence
in
himself
my
brain
is
not
so
easily
turned
i
hope
said
he
i
have
the
thought
of
my
name
and
the
fortune
i
must
make
as
ballast
for
i
beseech
you
not
to
play
insisted
the
viscount
listen
to
me
you
don
t
know
what
this
passion
for
play
is
the
strongest
and
the
coldest
natures
succumb
don
t
he
had
raised
his
voice
as
if
he
intended
to
be
overheard
by
two
guests
who
had
just
approached
the
sofa
they
did
indeed
hear
him
can
i
believe
my
own
eyes
and
ears
exclaimed
one
of
them
an
elderly
man
can
this
really
be
ferdinand
who
is
trying
to
shake
the
allegiance
of
the
votaries
of
our
noble
lady
the
queen
of
spades
de
coralth
turned
quickly
round
yes
it
is
indeed
i
he
answered
i
have
purchased
with
my
patrimony
the
right
of
saying
distrust
yourself
and
don
t
do
as
i
ve
done
to
an
inexperienced
the
wisest
counsels
given
in
a
certain
fashion
never
fail
to
produce
an
effect
diametrically
opposed
to
that
which
they
seemingly
aim
at
de
coralth
s
persistence
and
the
importance
he
attached
to
a
mere
trifle
could
not
fail
to
annoy
the
most
patient
man
in
the
world
and
in
fact
his
patronizing
tone
really
irritated
pascal
you
are
free
my
friend
to
do
as
you
please
said
he
but
i
are
you
resolved
interrupted
the
viscount
so
be
it
then
you
are
no
longer
a
child
and
i
have
warned
you
let
us
play
thereupon
they
approached
the
table
room
was
made
for
them
and
they
seated
themselves
pascal
being
on
ferdinand
de
coralth
s
side
the
guests
were
playing
baccarat
tournant
a
game
of
terrible
and
infantile
simplicity
there
are
no
such
things
as
skill
or
combination
possible
in
it
science
and
calculation
are
useless
chance
alone
decides
and
decides
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
amateurs
certainly
assert
that
with
great
coolness
and
long
practice
one
can
in
a
measure
at
least
avert
prolonged
maybe
they
are
right
but
it
is
not
conclusively
proved
each
person
takes
the
cards
in
his
turn
risks
what
he
chooses
and
when
his
stakes
are
covered
deals
if
he
wins
he
is
free
to
follow
up
his
vein
of
or
to
pass
the
deal
when
he
loses
the
deal
passes
at
once
to
the
next
player
on
the
right
a
moment
sufficed
for
pascal
ferailleur
to
learn
the
rules
of
the
game
it
was
already
ferdinand
s
deal
de
coralth
staked
a
hundred
francs
the
bet
was
taken
he
dealt
lost
and
handed
the
cards
to
pascal
the
play
which
had
been
rather
timid
at
first
since
it
was
necessary
as
they
say
to
try
the
luck
had
now
become
bolder
several
players
had
large
piles
of
gold
before
them
and
the
heavy
artillery
that
is
to
say
were
beginning
to
put
in
appearance
but
pascal
had
no
false
pride
i
stake
a
louis
said
he
the
smallness
of
the
sum
attracted
instant
attention
and
two
or
three
voices
replied
taken
he
dealt
and
won
two
louis
he
said
again
this
wager
was
also
taken
he
won
and
his
run
of
luck
was
so
remarkable
that
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
of
time
he
won
six
hundred
francs
pass
the
deal
whispered
ferdinand
and
pascal
followed
this
advice
not
because
i
desire
to
keep
my
winnings
he
whispered
in
de
coralth
s
ear
but
because
i
wish
to
have
enough
to
play
until
the
end
of
the
evening
without
risking
but
such
prudence
was
unnecessary
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
when
the
deal
came
to
him
again
fortune
favored
him
even
more
than
before
he
started
with
a
hundred
francs
and
doubling
them
each
time
in
six
successive
deals
he
won
more
than
three
thousand
francs
the
devil
monsieur
is
in
zounds
and
he
is
playing
for
the
first
that
accounts
for
it
the
inexperienced
always
pascal
could
not
fail
to
hear
these
comments
the
blood
mantled
over
his
cheeks
and
conscious
that
he
was
flushing
he
as
usually
happens
flushed
still
more
his
good
fortune
embarrassed
him
as
was
evident
and
he
played
most
recklessly
still
his
good
luck
did
not
desert
him
and
do
what
he
would
he
won
won
continually
in
fact
by
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
had
thousand
francs
before
him
for
some
time
he
had
been
the
object
of
close
attention
do
you
know
this
gentleman
inquired
one
of
the
guests
no
he
came
with
he
is
an
advocate
i
and
all
these
whispered
doubts
and
suspicions
these
questions
fraught
with
an
evil
significance
these
uncharitable
replies
grew
into
a
malevolent
murmur
which
resounded
in
pascal
s
ears
and
bewildered
him
he
was
really
becoming
most
uncomfortable
when
madame
d
argeles
approached
the
and
exclaimed
this
is
the
third
time
gentlemen
that
you
have
been
told
that
supper
is
ready
what
gentleman
will
offer
me
his
arm
there
was
an
evident
unwillingness
to
leave
the
table
but
an
old
gentleman
who
had
been
losing
heavily
rose
to
his
feet
yes
let
us
go
to
supper
he
exclaimed
perhaps
that
will
change
the
this
was
a
decisive
consideration
the
room
emptied
as
if
by
magic
and
no
one
was
left
at
the
table
but
pascal
who
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
with
all
the
gold
piled
up
before
him
he
succeeded
however
in
distributing
it
in
his
pockets
and
was
about
to
join
the
other
guests
in
the
when
madame
d
argeles
abruptly
barred
his
passage
i
desire
a
word
with
you
monsieur
she
said
her
face
still
retained
its
strange
immobility
and
the
same
stereotyped
smile
played
about
her
lips
and
yet
her
agitation
was
so
evident
that
pascal
in
spite
of
his
own
uneasiness
noticed
it
and
was
astonished
by
it
i
am
at
your
service
madame
he
stammered
bowing
she
at
once
took
his
arm
and
led
him
to
the
embrasure
of
a
window
i
am
a
stranger
to
you
monsieur
she
said
very
hurriedly
and
in
very
low
tones
and
yet
i
must
ask
and
you
must
grant
me
a
great
speak
she
hesitated
as
if
at
a
loss
for
words
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
said
eagerly
you
will
leave
this
house
at
once
without
warning
any
one
and
while
the
other
guests
are
at
pascal
s
astonishment
changed
into
stupor
why
am
i
to
go
he
asked
because
but
no
i
can
not
tell
you
consider
it
only
a
caprice
on
my
part
it
is
so
but
i
entreat
you
don
t
refuse
me
do
me
this
favor
and
i
shall
be
eternally
there
was
such
an
agony
of
supplication
in
her
voice
and
her
attitude
that
pascal
was
touched
a
vague
presentiment
of
some
terrible
irreparable
misfortune
disturbed
his
own
heart
nevertheless
he
sadly
shook
his
head
and
bitterly
exclaimed
you
are
perhaps
not
aware
that
i
have
just
won
over
thirty
thousand
yes
i
am
aware
of
it
and
this
is
only
another
and
still
stronger
reason
why
you
should
protect
yourself
against
possible
loss
it
is
well
to
pattern
after
charlemagne
in
this
house
the
other
night
the
count
d
antas
quietly
made
his
escape
bareheaded
he
took
a
thousand
louis
away
with
him
and
left
his
hat
in
exchange
the
count
is
a
brave
man
and
far
from
indulging
in
blame
every
one
applauded
him
the
next
day
come
you
have
decided
i
see
you
will
go
and
to
be
still
more
safe
i
will
show
you
out
through
the
servants
hall
then
no
one
can
possibly
see
pascal
had
almost
decided
to
yield
to
her
entreaties
but
this
proposed
retreat
through
the
was
too
revolting
to
his
pride
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
i
will
never
consent
to
such
a
thing
he
declared
what
would
they
think
of
me
besides
i
owe
them
their
revenge
and
i
shall
give
it
to
neither
madame
d
argeles
nor
pascal
had
noticed
de
coralth
who
in
the
meantime
had
stolen
into
the
room
on
tiptoe
and
had
been
listening
to
their
conversation
concealed
behind
the
folds
of
a
heavy
curtain
he
now
suddenly
revealed
his
presence
ah
my
dear
friend
he
exclaimed
in
a
winning
tone
while
i
honor
your
scruples
i
must
say
that
i
think
madame
is
a
hundred
times
right
if
i
were
in
your
place
if
i
had
won
what
you
have
won
i
shouldn
t
hesitate
others
might
think
what
they
pleased
you
have
the
money
that
is
the
main
for
the
second
time
the
viscount
s
intervention
decided
pascal
i
shall
remain
he
said
resolutely
but
madame
d
argeles
laid
her
hand
imploringly
on
his
arm
i
entreat
you
monsieur
said
she
go
now
there
is
still
yes
go
said
the
viscount
approvingly
it
would
be
a
most
excellent
move
retreat
and
save
the
these
words
were
like
the
drop
which
makes
the
cup
overflow
crimson
with
anger
and
assailed
by
the
strangest
suspicions
pascal
turned
from
madame
d
argeles
and
hastened
into
the
the
conversation
ceased
entirely
on
his
arrival
there
he
could
not
fail
to
understand
that
he
had
been
the
subject
of
it
a
secret
instinct
warned
him
that
all
the
men
around
him
were
his
enemies
though
he
knew
not
why
and
that
they
were
plotting
against
him
he
also
perceived
that
his
slightest
movements
were
watched
and
commented
upon
however
he
was
a
brave
man
his
conscience
did
not
reproach
him
in
the
least
and
he
was
one
of
those
persons
who
rather
than
wait
for
danger
provoke
it
so
with
an
almost
defiant
air
he
seated
himself
beside
a
young
lady
dressed
in
pink
tulle
and
began
to
laugh
and
chat
with
her
he
possessed
a
ready
wit
and
what
is
even
better
tact
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
astonished
those
around
him
by
his
brilliant
sallies
champagne
was
flowing
freely
and
he
drank
four
or
five
glasses
in
quick
succession
was
he
really
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
and
saying
he
subsequently
declared
that
he
was
not
that
he
acted
under
the
influence
of
a
sort
of
hallucination
similar
to
that
produced
by
the
inhalation
of
carbonic
gas
however
the
guests
did
not
linger
long
at
the
let
us
go
back
cried
the
old
gentleman
who
had
insisted
upon
the
suspension
of
the
game
we
are
wasting
a
deal
of
precious
time
here
pascal
rose
with
the
others
and
in
his
haste
to
enter
the
adjoining
room
he
jostled
two
men
who
were
talking
together
near
the
door
so
it
is
understood
said
one
of
them
yes
yes
leave
it
to
me
i
will
act
as
this
word
sent
all
pascal
s
blood
bounding
to
his
heart
who
is
to
be
executed
he
thought
i
am
evidently
to
be
the
victim
but
what
does
it
all
mean
meanwhile
the
players
at
the
green
table
had
changed
places
and
pascal
found
himself
seated
not
on
ferdinand
s
right
but
directly
opposite
him
and
between
two
men
about
his
own
age
one
of
them
being
the
person
who
had
announced
his
intention
of
acting
as
executioner
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
unfortunate
advocate
when
it
came
his
turn
to
deal
he
staked
two
hundred
louis
and
lost
them
there
was
a
slight
commotion
round
the
table
and
one
of
the
players
who
had
lost
most
heavily
remarked
in
an
undertone
don
t
look
so
hard
at
the
gentleman
he
won
t
have
any
more
as
pascal
heard
this
ironical
remark
uttered
in
a
tone
which
made
it
as
insulting
as
a
blow
a
gleam
of
light
darted
through
his
puzzled
brain
he
suspected
at
last
what
any
person
less
honest
than
himself
would
have
long
before
understood
he
thought
of
rising
and
demanding
an
apology
but
he
was
stunned
almost
overcome
by
the
horrors
of
his
situation
his
ears
tingled
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
beating
of
his
heart
were
suspended
however
the
game
proceeded
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
it
the
stakes
were
insignificant
and
loss
or
gain
drew
no
exclamation
from
any
one
the
attention
of
the
entire
party
was
concentrated
on
pascal
and
he
with
despair
in
his
heart
followed
the
movements
of
the
cards
which
were
passing
from
hand
to
hand
and
fast
approaching
him
again
when
they
reached
him
the
silence
became
breathless
menacing
even
sinister
the
ladies
and
the
guests
who
were
not
playing
approached
and
leaned
over
the
table
in
evident
anxiety
my
god
thought
pascal
my
god
if
i
can
only
lose
he
was
as
pale
as
death
the
perspiration
trickled
down
from
his
hair
upon
his
temples
and
his
hands
trembled
so
much
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
the
cards
i
will
stake
four
thousand
francs
he
faltered
i
take
your
bet
answered
a
voice
alas
the
unfortunate
fellow
s
wish
was
not
gratified
he
won
then
in
the
midst
of
the
wildest
confusion
he
exclaimed
here
are
eight
thousand
francs
taken
but
as
he
began
to
deal
the
cards
his
neighbor
sprang
up
seized
him
roughly
by
the
hands
and
cried
this
time
i
m
sure
of
it
you
are
a
thief
with
a
bound
pascal
was
on
his
feet
while
his
peril
had
been
vague
and
undetermined
his
energy
had
been
paralyzed
but
it
was
restored
to
him
intact
when
his
danger
declared
itself
in
all
its
horror
he
pushed
away
the
man
who
had
caught
his
hands
with
such
violence
that
he
sent
him
reeling
under
a
sofa
then
he
stepped
back
and
surveyed
the
excited
throng
with
an
air
of
menace
and
defiance
useless
seven
or
eight
players
sprang
upon
him
and
overpowered
him
as
if
he
had
been
the
vilest
criminal
meanwhile
the
executioner
as
he
had
styled
himself
had
risen
to
his
feet
with
his
cravat
untied
and
his
clothes
in
wild
disorder
yes
he
said
addressing
pascal
you
are
a
thief
i
saw
you
slip
other
cards
among
those
which
were
handed
to
wretch
gasped
pascal
i
saw
you
and
i
am
going
to
prove
so
saying
he
turned
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
had
dropped
into
an
and
imperiously
asked
how
many
packs
have
we
used
then
there
ought
to
be
two
hundred
and
sixty
cards
upon
the
thereupon
he
counted
them
slowly
and
with
particular
care
and
he
found
no
fewer
than
three
hundred
and
seven
well
scoundrel
he
cried
are
you
still
bold
enough
to
deny
it
pascal
had
no
desire
to
deny
it
he
knew
that
words
would
weigh
as
nothing
against
this
material
tangible
incontrovertible
proof
cards
had
been
fraudulently
inserted
among
the
others
certainly
not
by
him
but
by
whom
still
he
alone
had
been
the
gainer
through
the
deception
you
see
that
the
coward
will
not
even
defend
himself
exclaimed
one
of
the
women
he
did
not
deign
to
turn
his
head
what
did
the
insult
matter
to
him
he
knew
himself
to
be
innocent
and
yet
he
felt
that
he
was
sinking
to
the
lowest
depths
of
infamy
he
beheld
himself
disgraced
branded
ruined
and
realizing
that
he
must
meet
facts
with
facts
he
besought
god
to
grant
him
an
idea
an
inspiration
that
would
unmask
the
real
culprit
but
another
person
came
to
his
aid
with
a
boldness
which
no
one
would
have
expected
on
his
part
de
coralth
placed
himself
in
front
of
pascal
and
in
a
voice
which
betokened
more
indignation
than
sorrow
he
exclaimed
this
is
a
terrible
mistake
gentlemen
pascal
ferailleur
is
my
friend
and
his
past
vouches
for
his
present
go
to
the
palais
de
justice
and
make
inquiries
respecting
his
character
there
they
will
tell
you
how
utterly
impossible
it
is
that
this
man
can
be
guilty
of
the
ignoble
act
he
is
accused
no
one
made
any
reply
in
the
opinion
of
all
his
listeners
ferdinand
was
simply
fulfilling
a
duty
which
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
escape
the
old
gentleman
who
had
decided
the
suspension
and
the
resumption
of
the
game
gave
audible
expression
to
the
prevailing
sentiment
of
the
party
he
was
a
portly
man
who
puffed
like
a
porpoise
when
he
talked
and
whom
his
companions
called
the
baron
your
words
do
you
honor
really
do
you
honor
he
said
addressing
ferdinand
and
no
possible
blame
can
attach
to
you
that
your
friend
is
not
an
honest
man
is
no
fault
of
yours
there
is
no
outward
sign
to
distinguish
pascal
had
so
far
not
opened
his
lips
after
struggling
for
a
moment
in
the
hands
of
his
captors
he
now
stood
perfectly
motionless
glancing
furiously
around
him
as
if
hoping
to
discover
the
coward
who
had
prepared
the
trap
into
which
he
had
fallen
for
he
felt
certain
that
he
was
the
victim
of
some
atrocious
conspiracy
though
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
divine
what
motive
had
actuated
his
enemies
suddenly
those
who
were
holding
him
felt
him
tremble
he
raised
his
head
he
fancied
he
could
detect
a
ray
of
hope
shall
i
be
allowed
to
speak
in
my
own
defence
he
asked
speak
he
tried
to
free
himself
but
those
beside
him
would
not
relax
their
hold
so
he
desisted
and
then
in
a
voice
husky
with
emotion
he
exclaimed
i
am
innocent
i
am
the
victim
of
an
infamous
plot
who
the
author
of
it
is
i
do
not
know
but
there
is
some
one
here
who
must
angry
exclamations
and
sneering
laughs
interrupted
him
would
you
condemn
me
unheard
he
resumed
raising
his
voice
listen
to
me
about
an
hour
ago
while
you
were
at
supper
madame
d
argeles
almost
threw
herself
at
my
feet
as
she
entreated
me
to
leave
this
house
her
agitation
astonished
me
now
i
understand
the
gentleman
known
as
the
baron
turned
toward
madame
d
argeles
is
what
this
man
says
true
she
was
greatly
agitated
but
she
answered
why
were
you
so
anxious
for
him
to
go
i
don
t
know
a
presentiment
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
was
going
to
the
least
observant
of
the
party
could
not
fail
to
notice
madame
d
argeles
s
hesitation
and
confusion
but
even
the
shrewdest
were
deceived
they
supposed
that
she
had
seen
the
act
committed
and
had
tried
to
induce
the
culprit
to
make
his
escape
in
order
to
avoid
a
scandal
pascal
saw
he
could
expect
no
assistance
from
this
source
m
de
coralth
could
assure
you
he
began
oh
enough
of
that
interrupted
a
player
i
myself
heard
de
coralth
do
his
best
to
persuade
you
not
to
so
the
unfortunate
fellow
s
last
and
only
hope
had
vanished
still
he
made
a
supreme
effort
and
addressing
madame
d
argeles
madame
he
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
anguish
i
entreat
you
tell
what
you
know
will
you
allow
an
honorable
man
to
be
ruined
before
your
very
eyes
will
you
abandon
an
innocent
man
whom
you
could
save
by
a
single
word
but
she
remained
silent
and
pascal
staggered
as
if
some
one
had
dealt
him
a
terrible
blow
it
is
all
over
he
muttered
no
one
heard
him
everybody
was
listening
to
the
baron
who
seemed
to
be
very
much
put
out
we
are
wasting
precious
time
with
all
this
said
he
we
should
have
made
at
least
five
rounds
while
this
absurd
scene
has
been
going
on
we
must
put
an
end
to
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
fellow
i
am
in
favor
of
sending
for
a
commissary
of
such
was
not
at
all
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
guests
four
or
five
of
the
ladies
took
flight
at
the
bare
suggestion
and
several
men
the
most
aristocratic
of
the
company
became
angry
at
once
are
you
mad
said
one
of
them
do
you
want
to
see
us
all
summoned
as
witnesses
you
have
probably
forgotten
that
garcia
affair
and
that
rumpus
at
jenny
fancy
s
house
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
to
see
no
one
knows
how
many
great
names
mixed
up
with
those
of
sharpers
and
notorious
women
naturally
of
a
florid
complexion
the
baron
s
face
now
became
scarlet
so
it
s
fear
of
scandal
that
deters
you
zounds
sir
a
man
s
courage
should
equal
his
vices
look
at
celebrated
for
his
income
of
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
for
his
estates
in
burgundy
for
his
passion
for
gaming
his
horses
and
his
cook
the
baron
wielded
a
mighty
influence
still
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
carry
the
day
for
it
was
decided
that
the
sharper
should
be
allowed
to
depart
unmolested
make
him
at
least
return
the
money
growled
a
loser
compel
him
to
his
winnings
are
there
upon
the
don
t
believe
it
cried
the
baron
all
these
scoundrels
have
secret
pockets
in
which
they
stow
away
their
plunder
search
him
by
all
that
s
it
search
him
crushed
by
this
unexpected
undeserved
and
incomprehensible
misfortune
pascal
had
almost
yielded
to
his
fate
but
the
shameful
cry
search
him
kindled
terrible
wrath
in
his
brain
he
shook
off
his
assailants
as
a
lion
shakes
off
the
hounds
that
have
attacked
him
and
reaching
the
fireplace
with
a
single
bound
he
snatched
up
a
heavy
bronze
candelabrum
and
brandished
it
in
the
air
crying
the
first
who
approaches
is
a
dead
man
he
was
ready
to
strike
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
and
such
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
determined
man
becomes
positively
terrible
the
danger
seemed
so
great
and
so
certain
that
his
enemies
paused
each
encouraging
his
neighbor
with
his
glance
but
no
one
was
inclined
to
engage
in
this
struggle
by
which
the
victor
would
merely
gain
a
few
stand
back
and
allow
me
to
retire
said
pascal
imperiously
they
still
hesitated
but
finally
made
way
and
formidable
in
his
indignation
and
audacity
he
reached
the
door
of
the
room
unmolested
and
disappeared
this
superb
outburst
of
outraged
honor
this
marvellous
energy
succeeding
as
it
did
the
most
complete
mental
prostration
and
these
terrible
threats
had
proved
so
prompt
and
that
no
one
had
thought
of
cutting
off
pascal
s
retreat
the
guests
had
not
recovered
from
their
stupor
but
were
still
standing
silent
and
intimidated
when
they
heard
the
outer
door
close
after
him
it
was
a
woman
who
at
last
broke
the
spell
ah
well
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
intense
admiration
that
handsome
fellow
is
he
naturally
desired
to
save
his
plunder
it
was
the
same
expression
that
de
coralth
had
employed
and
which
had
perhaps
prevented
pascal
from
yielding
to
madame
d
argeles
s
entreaties
everybody
applauded
the
sentiment
everybody
the
baron
excepted
this
rich
man
whose
passions
had
dragged
him
into
the
vilest
dens
of
europe
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
sharpers
and
scoundrels
of
every
type
from
those
who
ride
in
their
carriages
down
to
the
vagabond
he
knew
the
thief
who
grovels
at
his
victim
s
feet
humbly
confessing
his
crime
the
desperate
knave
who
swallows
the
notes
he
has
stolen
the
abject
wretch
who
bares
his
back
to
receive
the
blows
he
deserves
and
the
rascal
who
boldly
confronts
his
accusers
and
protests
his
innocence
with
the
indignation
of
an
honest
man
but
never
in
any
of
these
scoundrels
had
the
baron
seen
the
proud
steadfast
glance
with
which
this
man
had
awed
his
accusers
with
this
thought
uppermost
in
his
mind
he
drew
the
person
who
had
seized
pascal
s
hands
at
the
a
little
aside
tell
me
said
he
did
you
actually
see
that
young
man
slip
the
cards
into
the
pack
no
not
exactly
but
you
know
what
we
agreed
at
supper
we
were
sure
that
he
was
cheating
and
it
was
necessary
to
find
some
pretext
for
counting
the
what
if
he
shouldn
t
be
guilty
after
all
who
else
could
be
guilty
then
he
was
the
only
to
this
terrible
argument
the
same
which
had
silenced
pascal
the
baron
made
no
reply
indeed
his
intervention
became
necessary
elsewhere
for
the
other
guests
were
beginning
to
talk
loudly
and
excitedly
around
the
pile
of
gold
and
which
pascal
had
left
on
the
table
they
had
counted
it
and
found
it
to
amount
to
the
sum
of
thousand
three
hundred
and
twenty
francs
and
it
was
the
question
of
dividing
it
properly
among
the
losers
which
was
causing
all
this
uproar
among
these
guests
who
belonged
to
the
highest
society
among
these
judges
who
had
so
summarily
convicted
an
innocent
man
and
suggested
the
searching
of
a
supposed
sharper
only
a
moment
before
there
were
several
who
unblushingly
misrepresented
their
losses
this
was
undeniable
for
on
adding
the
various
amounts
that
were
claimed
together
a
grand
total
of
thousand
francs
was
reached
had
this
man
who
had
just
fled
taken
the
difference
between
the
two
sums
away
with
him
a
difference
amounting
almost
to
thousand
francs
no
this
was
impossible
the
supposition
could
not
be
entertained
for
a
moment
however
the
discussion
might
have
taken
an
unfortunate
turn
had
it
not
been
for
the
baron
in
all
matters
relating
to
cards
his
word
was
law
he
quietly
said
it
is
all
right
and
they
submitted
nevertheless
he
absolutely
refused
to
take
his
share
of
the
money
and
after
the
division
rubbing
his
hands
as
if
he
were
delighted
to
see
this
disagreeable
affair
concluded
he
exclaimed
it
is
only
six
o
clock
we
have
still
time
for
a
few
but
the
other
guests
pale
disturbed
and
secretly
ashamed
of
themselves
were
eager
to
depart
and
in
fact
they
were
already
hastening
to
the
at
least
play
a
game
of
ecarte
cried
the
baron
a
simple
game
of
ecarte
at
twenty
louis
a
but
no
one
listened
and
he
reluctantly
prepared
to
follow
his
departing
friends
who
bowed
to
madame
d
argeles
on
the
landing
as
they
filed
by
de
coralth
who
was
among
the
last
to
retire
had
already
reached
the
staircase
and
descended
two
or
three
steps
when
madame
d
argeles
called
to
him
remain
said
she
i
want
to
speak
with
you
will
excuse
me
he
began
i
but
she
again
bade
him
remain
in
such
an
imperious
tone
that
he
dared
not
resist
he
reascended
the
stairs
very
much
after
the
manner
of
a
man
who
is
being
dragged
into
a
dentist
s
office
and
followed
madame
d
argeles
into
a
small
boudoir
at
the
end
of
the
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
the
mistress
of
the
house
turned
to
her
prisoner
now
you
will
explain
said
she
it
was
you
who
brought
pascal
ferailleur
alas
i
know
only
too
well
that
i
ought
to
beg
your
forgiveness
however
this
affair
will
cost
me
dear
myself
it
has
already
embroiled
me
in
a
difficulty
with
that
fool
of
a
rochecote
with
whom
i
shall
have
to
fight
in
less
than
a
couple
of
where
did
you
make
his
acquaintance
whose
rochecote
s
madame
d
argeles
s
sempiternal
smile
had
altogether
disappeared
i
am
speaking
seriously
said
she
with
a
threatening
ring
in
her
voice
how
did
you
happen
to
become
acquainted
with
ferailleur
that
can
be
very
easily
explained
seven
or
eight
months
ago
i
had
need
of
an
advocate
s
services
and
he
was
recommended
to
me
he
managed
my
case
very
cleverly
and
we
kept
up
the
what
is
his
position
de
coralth
s
features
wore
an
expression
of
exceeding
weariness
as
if
he
greatly
longed
to
go
to
sleep
he
had
indeed
installed
himself
in
a
large
in
a
position
upon
my
word
i
don
t
know
he
replied
pascal
had
always
seemed
to
be
the
most
irreproachable
man
in
the
world
a
man
you
might
call
a
philosopher
he
lives
in
a
retired
part
of
the
city
near
the
pantheon
with
his
mother
who
is
a
widow
a
very
respectable
woman
always
dressed
in
black
when
she
opened
the
door
for
me
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
visit
i
thought
some
old
family
portrait
had
stepped
down
from
its
frame
to
receive
me
i
judge
them
to
be
in
comfortable
circumstances
pascal
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
remarkable
man
and
people
supposed
he
would
rise
very
high
in
his
but
now
he
is
ruined
his
career
is
certainly
you
can
be
quite
sure
that
by
this
evening
all
paris
will
know
what
occurred
here
last
he
paused
meeting
madame
argeles
s
look
of
withering
scorn
with
a
cleverly
assumed
air
of
astonishment
you
are
a
villain
monsieur
de
coralth
she
said
indignantly
i
and
why
because
it
was
you
who
slipped
those
cards
which
made
ferailleur
win
into
the
pack
i
saw
you
do
it
and
yielding
to
my
entreaties
the
young
fellow
was
about
to
leave
the
house
when
you
intentionally
prevented
him
from
saving
himself
oh
don
t
deny
de
coralth
rose
in
the
coolest
possible
manner
i
deny
nothing
my
dear
lady
he
replied
absolutely
nothing
you
and
i
understand
each
confounded
by
his
unblushing
impudence
madame
d
argeles
remained
speechless
for
a
moment
you
confess
it
she
cried
at
last
you
dare
to
confess
it
were
you
not
afraid
that
i
might
speak
and
state
what
i
had
seen
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
one
would
have
believed
you
he
exclaimed
yes
i
should
have
been
believed
monsieur
de
coralth
for
i
could
have
given
proofs
you
must
have
forgotten
that
i
know
you
that
your
past
life
is
no
secret
to
me
that
i
know
who
you
are
and
what
dishonored
name
you
hide
beneath
your
borrowed
title
i
could
have
told
my
guests
that
you
are
married
that
you
have
abandoned
your
wife
and
child
leaving
them
to
perish
in
want
and
misery
i
could
have
told
them
where
you
obtain
the
thirty
or
forty
thousand
francs
you
spend
each
year
you
must
have
forgotten
that
rose
told
me
everything
monsieur
paul
she
had
struck
the
right
place
this
time
and
with
such
precision
that
de
coralth
turned
livid
and
made
a
furious
gesture
as
if
he
were
about
to
fell
her
to
the
ground
ah
take
care
he
exclaimed
take
care
but
his
rage
speedily
subsided
and
with
his
usual
indifferent
manner
and
in
a
bantering
tone
he
said
well
what
of
that
do
you
fancy
that
the
world
doesn
t
already
suspect
what
you
could
reveal
people
have
suspected
me
of
being
even
worse
than
i
am
when
you
proclaim
on
the
housetops
that
i
am
an
adventurer
folks
will
only
laugh
at
you
and
i
shall
be
none
the
worse
for
it
a
matter
that
would
crush
a
dozen
men
like
pascal
ferailleur
would
not
injure
me
in
the
least
i
am
accustomed
to
it
i
must
have
luxury
and
enjoyment
everything
that
is
pleasant
and
beautiful
and
to
procure
all
this
i
do
my
very
best
it
is
true
that
i
don
t
derive
my
income
from
my
estate
in
brie
but
i
have
plenty
of
money
and
that
is
the
essential
thing
besides
it
is
so
difficult
to
earn
a
livelihood
nowadays
and
the
love
of
luxury
is
so
intense
that
no
one
knows
at
night
what
he
may
do
or
rather
what
he
won
t
do
the
next
day
and
last
but
not
least
the
people
who
ought
to
be
despised
are
so
numerous
that
contempt
is
an
impossibility
a
parisian
who
happened
to
be
so
absurdly
pretentious
as
to
refuse
to
shake
hands
with
such
of
his
acquaintances
as
were
not
irreproachable
characters
might
walk
for
hours
on
the
boulevards
without
finding
an
occasion
to
take
his
hands
out
of
his
de
coralth
talked
well
enough
and
yet
in
point
of
fact
all
this
was
sheer
bravado
on
his
part
he
knew
better
than
any
one
else
on
what
a
frail
and
uncertain
basis
his
brilliant
existence
was
established
certainly
society
does
show
great
indulgence
to
people
of
doubtful
reputation
it
shuts
its
eyes
and
refuses
to
look
or
listen
but
this
is
all
the
more
reason
why
it
should
be
pitiless
when
a
person
s
guilt
is
positively
established
thus
although
he
assumed
an
air
of
insolent
security
the
viscount
anxiously
watched
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
madame
d
argeles
fortunately
for
himself
he
saw
that
she
was
abashed
by
his
cynicism
and
so
he
resumed
besides
as
our
friend
the
baron
would
say
we
are
wasting
precious
time
in
discussing
improbable
and
even
impossible
suppositions
i
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
your
heart
and
your
intelligence
my
dear
madame
to
be
sure
that
you
would
not
speak
a
word
to
my
indeed
what
prevented
me
from
doing
so
i
did
or
perhaps
i
ought
rather
to
say
your
own
good
sense
which
closed
your
mouth
when
monsieur
pascal
entreated
you
to
speak
in
his
defence
i
am
entitled
to
considerable
indulgence
madame
and
a
great
deal
ought
to
be
forgiven
me
my
mother
unfortunately
was
an
honest
woman
who
did
not
furnish
me
with
the
means
of
gratifying
every
madame
d
argeles
recoiled
as
if
a
serpent
had
suddenly
crossed
her
path
what
do
you
mean
she
faltered
you
know
as
well
as
i
i
don
t
understand
you
explain
with
the
impatient
gesture
of
a
man
who
finds
himself
compelled
to
answer
an
idle
question
and
assuming
an
air
of
hypocritical
commiseration
he
replied
well
since
you
insist
upon
it
i
know
in
paris
in
the
rue
de
helder
to
be
more
exact
a
nice
young
fellow
whose
lot
i
have
often
envied
he
has
wanted
for
nothing
since
the
day
he
came
into
the
world
at
school
he
had
three
times
as
much
money
as
his
richest
playfellow
when
his
studies
were
finished
a
tutor
was
provided
with
his
pockets
full
of
gold
to
conduct
this
favored
youth
to
italy
egypt
and
greece
he
is
now
studying
law
and
four
times
a
year
with
unvarying
punctuality
he
receives
a
letter
from
london
containing
five
thousand
francs
this
is
all
the
more
remarkable
as
this
young
man
has
neither
a
father
nor
a
mother
he
is
alone
in
the
world
with
his
income
of
twenty
thousand
francs
i
have
heard
him
say
jestingly
that
some
good
fairy
must
be
watching
over
him
but
i
know
that
he
believes
himself
to
be
the
illegitimate
son
of
some
great
english
nobleman
sometimes
when
he
has
drunk
a
little
too
much
he
talks
of
going
in
search
of
my
lord
his
the
effect
de
coralth
had
created
by
these
words
must
have
been
extremely
gratifying
to
him
for
madame
d
argeles
had
fallen
back
in
her
chair
almost
fainting
so
my
dear
madame
he
continued
if
i
ever
had
any
reason
to
fancy
that
you
intended
causing
me
any
trouble
i
should
go
to
this
charming
youth
and
say
my
good
fellow
you
are
strangely
deceived
your
money
doesn
t
come
from
the
of
an
english
peer
but
from
a
small
gambling
den
with
which
i
am
very
well
acquainted
having
often
had
occasion
to
swell
its
revenues
with
my
and
if
he
mourned
his
vanished
dreams
i
should
tell
him
you
are
wrong
for
if
the
great
nobleman
is
lost
the
good
fairy
remains
she
is
none
other
than
your
mother
a
very
worthy
person
whose
only
object
in
life
is
your
comfort
and
and
if
he
doubted
my
word
i
should
bring
him
to
his
mother
s
house
some
baccarat
night
and
there
would
be
a
scene
of
recognition
worthy
of
fargueil
s
any
man
but
de
coralth
would
have
had
some
compassion
for
madame
d
argeles
was
evidently
suffering
agony
it
is
as
i
feared
she
moaned
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
however
he
heard
her
what
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
intense
astonishment
did
you
really
doubt
it
no
i
can
t
believe
it
it
would
be
doing
injustice
to
your
intelligence
and
experience
are
people
like
ourselves
obliged
to
talk
in
order
to
understand
each
other
should
i
ever
have
ventured
to
do
what
i
have
done
in
your
house
if
i
had
not
known
the
secret
of
your
maternal
tenderness
delicacy
of
feeling
and
devotion
she
was
weeping
big
tears
were
rolling
down
her
face
tracing
a
broad
furrow
through
the
powder
on
her
cheeks
he
knows
everything
she
murmured
he
knows
everything
by
the
merest
chance
i
assure
you
as
i
don
t
like
folks
to
meddle
with
my
affairs
i
never
meddle
with
theirs
as
i
have
just
said
it
was
entirely
the
work
of
chance
one
april
afternoon
i
came
to
invite
you
to
a
drive
in
the
bois
i
was
ushered
into
this
very
room
where
we
are
sitting
now
and
found
you
writing
i
said
i
would
wait
until
you
finished
your
letter
but
some
one
called
you
and
you
hastily
left
the
room
how
it
was
that
i
happened
to
approach
your
i
can
not
explain
but
i
did
approach
it
and
read
your
unfinished
letter
upon
my
word
it
touched
me
deeply
i
can
give
no
better
proof
of
the
truth
of
my
assertion
than
the
fact
that
i
can
repeat
it
almost
word
for
word
even
now
dear
sir
you
wrote
to
your
london
correspondent
i
send
you
three
thousand
francs
in
addition
to
the
five
thousand
for
the
regular
quarterly
payment
forward
the
money
without
delay
i
fear
the
poor
boy
is
greatly
annoyed
by
his
creditors
yesterday
i
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
him
in
the
rue
de
helder
and
i
found
him
looking
pale
and
careworn
when
you
send
him
this
money
forward
at
the
same
time
a
letter
of
fatherly
advice
it
is
true
he
ought
to
work
and
win
an
honorable
position
for
himself
but
think
of
the
dangers
and
temptation
that
beset
him
alone
and
friendless
in
this
corrupt
there
my
dear
lady
your
letter
ended
but
the
name
and
address
were
given
and
it
was
easy
enough
to
understand
it
you
remember
perhaps
a
little
incident
that
occurred
after
your
return
on
perceiving
that
you
had
forgotten
your
letter
you
turned
pale
and
glanced
at
me
have
you
read
it
and
do
you
understand
it
your
eyes
asked
while
mine
replied
yes
but
i
shall
be
and
i
shall
be
silent
too
said
madame
d
argeles
de
coralth
took
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
i
knew
we
should
understand
each
other
he
remarked
gravely
i
am
not
bad
at
heart
believe
me
and
if
i
had
possessed
money
of
my
own
or
a
mother
like
you
she
averted
her
face
fearing
perhaps
that
de
coralth
might
read
her
opinion
of
him
in
her
eyes
but
after
a
short
pause
she
exclaimed
beseechingly
now
that
i
am
your
accomplice
let
me
entreat
you
to
do
all
you
possibly
can
to
prevent
last
night
s
affair
from
being
noised
if
not
for
ferailleur
s
sake
for
the
sake
of
his
poor
widowed
pascal
must
be
put
out
of
the
way
why
do
you
say
that
do
you
hate
him
so
much
then
what
has
he
done
to
you
to
me
personally
nothing
i
even
feel
actual
sympathy
for
madame
d
argeles
was
confounded
what
she
stammered
it
wasn
t
on
your
own
account
that
you
did
this
why
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
quivering
with
scorn
and
indignation
cried
ah
then
the
deed
is
even
more
infamous
even
more
cowardly
but
alarmed
by
the
threatening
gleam
in
de
coralth
s
eyes
she
went
no
further
a
truce
to
these
disagreeable
truths
said
he
coldly
if
we
expressed
our
opinions
of
each
other
without
reserve
in
this
world
we
should
soon
come
to
hard
words
do
you
think
i
acted
for
my
own
pleasure
suppose
some
one
had
seen
me
when
i
slipped
the
cards
into
the
pack
if
that
had
happened
i
should
have
been
and
you
think
that
no
one
suspects
you
no
one
i
lost
more
than
a
hundred
louis
myself
if
pascal
belonged
to
our
set
people
might
investigate
the
matter
perhaps
but
it
will
be
and
will
he
have
no
suspicions
he
will
have
no
proofs
to
offer
in
any
madame
d
argeles
seemed
to
resign
herself
to
the
inevitable
i
hope
you
will
at
least
tell
me
on
whose
behalf
you
acted
she
remarked
impossible
replied
de
coralth
and
consulting
his
watch
he
added
but
i
am
forgetting
myself
i
am
forgetting
that
that
idiot
of
a
rochecote
is
waiting
for
a
so
go
to
sleep
my
dear
lady
and
till
we
meet
she
accompanied
him
so
far
as
the
landing
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
is
hastening
to
the
house
of
ferailleur
s
enemy
she
thought
and
calling
her
confidential
servant
quick
job
she
said
follow
de
coralth
i
want
to
know
where
he
is
going
and
above
all
take
care
that
he
doesn
t
see
if
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
paris
there
is
a
really
quiet
peaceful
street
a
refuge
for
the
thoughtfully
inclined
it
is
surely
the
broad
rue
d
ulm
which
starts
from
the
place
du
pantheon
and
finishes
abruptly
at
the
rue
des
feuillantines
the
shops
are
unassuming
and
so
few
that
one
can
easily
count
them
there
is
a
on
the
side
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
then
a
little
then
a
washerwoman
s
and
then
a
s
establishment
while
on
the
you
will
find
the
office
of
the
bulletin
with
a
locksmith
s
a
fruiterer
s
and
a
baker
s
that
is
all
along
the
rest
of
the
street
run
several
spacious
buildings
somewhat
austere
in
appearance
though
some
of
them
are
surrounded
by
large
gardens
here
stands
the
convent
of
the
sisters
of
the
cross
with
the
house
of
our
lady
of
adoration
while
further
on
near
the
rue
des
feuillantines
you
find
the
normal
school
with
the
office
of
the
general
omnibus
company
hard
by
at
you
mostly
meet
grave
and
thoughtful
faces
in
the
street
priests
savants
professors
and
clerks
employed
in
the
adjacent
public
libraries
the
only
stir
is
round
about
the
omnibus
office
and
if
occasional
bursts
of
laughter
are
heard
they
are
sure
to
come
from
the
normal
school
after
nightfall
a
person
might
suppose
himself
to
be
at
least
a
hundred
leagues
from
the
boulevard
montmartre
and
the
in
some
quiet
old
provincial
town
at
poitiers
for
instance
and
it
is
only
on
listening
attentively
that
you
can
catch
even
a
faint
echo
of
the
tumult
of
paris
it
was
in
this
street
out
of
the
world
as
de
coralth
expressed
it
that
pascal
ferailleur
resided
with
his
mother
they
occupied
a
second
floor
a
pretty
suite
of
five
rooms
looking
out
upon
a
garden
their
rent
was
high
indeed
they
paid
fourteen
hundred
francs
a
year
but
this
was
a
burden
which
pascal
s
profession
imposed
upon
him
for
he
of
course
required
a
private
office
and
a
little
for
his
clients
with
this
exception
the
mother
and
son
led
a
straightened
simple
life
their
only
servant
was
a
woman
who
came
at
seven
o
clock
to
do
the
heavy
work
went
home
again
at
twelve
and
did
not
return
again
until
the
evening
to
serve
dinner
madame
ferailleur
attended
to
everything
not
blushing
in
the
least
when
she
was
compelled
to
open
the
door
for
some
client
besides
she
could
do
this
without
the
least
risk
of
encountering
disrespect
so
imposing
and
dignified
were
her
manners
and
her
person
de
coralth
had
shown
excellent
judgment
when
he
compared
her
to
a
family
portrait
she
was
in
fact
exactly
the
person
a
painter
would
select
to
represent
some
old
burgher
s
wife
a
chaste
and
loving
spouse
a
devoted
mother
an
incomparable
housewife
in
one
phrase
the
faithful
guardian
of
her
husband
s
domestic
happiness
she
had
just
passed
her
fiftieth
birthday
and
looked
fully
her
age
she
had
suffered
a
close
observer
would
have
detected
traces
of
weeping
about
her
wrinkled
eyelids
and
the
twinge
of
her
lips
was
expressive
of
cruel
anguish
heroically
endured
still
she
was
not
severe
nor
even
too
sedate
and
the
few
friends
who
visited
her
were
often
really
astonished
at
her
wit
besides
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
have
no
history
and
who
find
happiness
in
what
others
would
call
duty
her
life
could
be
summed
up
in
a
single
sentence
she
had
loved
she
had
mourned
the
daughter
of
a
petty
clerk
in
one
of
the
government
departments
and
merely
dowered
with
a
modest
portion
of
three
thousand
francs
she
had
married
a
young
man
as
poor
as
herself
but
intelligent
and
industrious
whom
she
loved
and
who
adored
her
this
young
man
on
marrying
had
sworn
that
he
would
make
a
fortune
not
that
he
cared
for
money
for
himself
but
he
wished
to
provide
his
idol
with
every
luxury
his
love
enhancing
his
energy
no
doubt
hastened
his
success
attached
as
a
chemist
to
a
large
manufacturing
establishment
his
services
soon
became
so
invaluable
to
his
employers
that
they
gave
him
a
considerable
interest
in
the
business
his
name
even
obtained
an
honorable
place
among
modern
inventors
and
we
are
indebted
to
him
for
the
discovery
of
one
of
those
brilliant
colors
that
are
extracted
from
common
coal
at
the
end
of
ten
years
he
had
become
a
man
of
means
he
loved
his
wife
as
fondly
as
on
the
day
of
their
marriage
and
he
had
a
son
pascal
unfortunate
fellow
one
day
in
the
full
sunshine
of
happiness
and
success
while
he
was
engaged
in
a
series
of
experiments
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
durable
and
at
the
same
time
perfectly
harmless
green
the
chemicals
exploded
smashing
the
mortar
which
he
held
and
wounding
him
horribly
about
the
head
and
chest
a
fortnight
later
he
died
apparently
calm
but
in
reality
a
prey
to
bitter
regrets
it
was
a
terrible
blow
for
his
poor
wife
and
the
thought
of
her
son
alone
reconciled
her
to
life
pascal
was
now
everything
to
her
her
present
and
her
future
and
she
solemnly
vowed
that
she
would
make
a
noble
man
of
him
but
alas
misfortunes
never
come
singly
one
of
her
husband
s
friends
who
acted
as
administrator
to
the
estate
took
a
contemptible
advantage
of
her
inexperience
she
went
to
sleep
one
night
possessing
an
income
of
fifteen
thousand
francs
but
she
awoke
to
find
herself
ruined
so
completely
ruined
that
she
did
not
know
where
to
obtain
her
dinner
for
that
same
evening
had
she
been
alone
in
the
world
she
would
not
have
grieved
much
over
the
catastrophe
but
she
was
sadly
affected
by
the
thought
that
her
son
s
future
was
perhaps
irrevocably
blighted
and
that
in
any
case
this
disaster
would
condemn
him
to
enter
life
through
the
cramped
and
gloomy
portals
of
poverty
however
madame
ferailleur
was
of
too
courageous
and
too
proud
a
nature
not
to
meet
this
danger
with
virile
energy
she
wasted
no
time
in
useless
lamentations
she
determined
to
repair
the
harm
as
far
as
it
was
in
her
power
to
repair
it
resolving
that
her
son
s
studies
at
the
college
of
should
not
be
interrupted
even
if
she
had
to
labor
with
her
own
hands
and
when
she
spoke
of
manual
toil
it
was
no
wild
unmeaning
exaggeration
born
of
sorrow
and
a
passing
flash
of
courage
she
found
employment
as
a
and
in
sewing
for
large
shops
until
she
at
last
obtained
a
situation
as
clerk
in
the
establishment
where
her
husband
had
been
a
partner
to
obtain
this
she
was
obliged
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
bookkeeping
but
she
was
amply
repaid
for
her
trouble
for
the
situation
was
worth
eighteen
hundred
francs
a
year
besides
food
and
lodging
then
only
did
her
efforts
momentarily
abate
she
felt
that
her
arduous
task
was
drawing
to
a
happy
close
pascal
s
expenses
at
school
amounted
to
about
nine
hundred
francs
a
year
she
did
not
spend
more
than
one
hundred
on
herself
and
thus
she
was
able
to
save
nearly
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
was
admirably
seconded
in
her
efforts
by
her
son
pascal
was
only
twelve
years
old
when
his
mother
said
to
him
i
have
ruined
you
my
son
nothing
remains
of
the
fortune
which
your
father
accumulated
by
dint
of
toil
and
you
will
be
obliged
to
rely
upon
yourself
my
boy
god
grant
that
in
years
to
come
you
will
not
reproach
me
for
my
the
child
did
not
throw
himself
into
her
arms
but
holding
his
head
proudly
erect
he
answered
i
shall
love
you
even
more
dear
mother
if
that
be
possible
as
for
the
fortune
which
my
father
left
you
i
will
restore
it
to
you
again
i
am
no
longer
a
i
am
a
man
as
you
shall
one
could
not
fail
to
perceive
that
he
had
taken
a
solemn
vow
although
he
possessed
a
remarkable
mind
and
the
power
of
acquiring
knowledge
rapidly
he
had
so
far
worked
indifferently
and
then
only
by
fits
and
starts
whenever
examination
time
drew
near
but
from
that
day
forward
he
did
not
lose
a
moment
his
remarks
which
were
at
once
comical
and
touching
were
those
of
the
head
of
a
family
deeply
impressed
by
a
sense
of
his
own
responsibility
you
see
he
said
to
his
companions
who
were
astonished
at
his
sudden
thirst
for
knowledge
i
can
t
afford
to
wear
out
my
breeches
on
the
college
forms
now
that
my
poor
mother
has
to
pay
for
them
with
her
his
was
not
in
the
least
impaired
by
his
resolve
not
to
spend
a
single
penny
of
his
pocket
money
with
a
tact
unusual
at
his
age
or
indeed
at
any
other
he
bore
his
misfortunes
simply
and
proudly
without
any
of
the
servile
humility
or
sullen
envy
which
so
often
accompanies
poverty
for
three
years
in
succession
the
highest
prizes
at
the
competitions
rewarded
him
for
his
efforts
but
these
successes
far
from
elating
him
unduly
seemed
to
afford
him
but
little
satisfaction
this
is
only
glory
he
thought
and
his
great
ambition
was
to
support
himself
he
was
soon
able
to
do
so
thanks
to
the
kindness
of
the
who
offered
him
his
tuition
gratis
if
he
would
assist
in
superintending
some
of
the
lower
classes
thus
one
day
when
madame
ferailleur
presented
herself
as
usual
to
make
her
quarterly
payment
the
steward
replied
you
owe
us
nothing
madame
everything
has
been
paid
by
your
she
almost
fainted
after
bearing
adversity
so
bravely
this
happiness
proved
too
much
for
her
she
could
scarcely
believe
it
a
long
explanation
was
necessary
to
convince
her
of
the
truth
and
then
big
tears
tears
of
joy
this
time
gushed
from
her
eyes
in
this
way
pascal
ferailleur
paid
all
the
expenses
of
his
education
until
he
had
won
his
degree
arming
himself
so
as
to
resist
the
trials
that
awaited
him
and
giving
abundant
proof
of
energy
and
ability
he
wished
to
be
a
lawyer
and
the
law
he
was
forced
to
admit
is
a
profession
which
is
almost
beyond
the
reach
of
penniless
young
men
but
there
are
no
insurmountable
obstacles
for
those
whose
hearts
are
really
set
on
an
object
on
the
very
day
that
pascal
inscribed
his
name
as
a
student
at
the
law
school
he
entered
an
advocate
s
office
as
a
clerk
his
duties
which
were
extremely
tiresome
at
first
had
the
advantage
of
familiarizing
him
with
the
forms
of
legal
procedure
and
of
furnishing
him
with
the
means
of
prosecuting
his
studies
after
he
had
been
in
the
office
six
months
his
employer
agreed
to
pay
him
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
which
were
increased
to
fifteen
hundred
at
the
end
of
the
second
twelvemonth
in
three
years
when
he
had
passed
his
final
examination
qualifying
him
to
practise
his
patron
raised
him
to
the
position
of
with
a
salary
of
three
thousand
francs
which
pascal
was
moreover
able
to
increase
considerably
by
drawing
up
documents
for
busy
attorneys
and
assisting
them
in
the
preparation
of
their
least
important
cases
it
was
certainly
something
wonderful
to
have
achieved
such
a
result
in
so
short
a
time
but
the
most
difficult
part
of
his
task
had
still
to
be
accomplished
it
was
a
perilous
undertaking
to
abandon
an
assured
position
to
cast
a
certainty
aside
for
the
chances
of
life
at
the
bar
it
was
a
grave
step
so
grave
indeed
that
pascal
hesitated
for
a
long
time
he
was
threatened
with
the
danger
that
always
threatens
subordinates
who
are
useful
to
their
superiors
he
felt
that
his
employer
who
was
in
the
habit
of
relieving
himself
of
his
heaviest
duties
by
intrusting
them
to
him
would
not
be
likely
to
forgive
him
for
leaving
and
on
starting
on
his
own
account
he
could
ill
afford
to
dispense
with
this
lawyer
s
the
patronage
that
could
scarcely
fail
to
follow
him
from
an
office
where
he
had
served
for
four
years
was
the
most
substantial
basis
of
his
calculations
for
the
future
eventually
he
succeeded
to
his
satisfaction
though
not
without
some
difficulty
and
only
by
employing
that
supreme
finesse
which
consists
in
absolute
frankness
before
his
office
had
been
open
a
fortnight
he
had
seven
or
eight
briefs
waiting
their
turn
upon
his
desk
and
his
first
efforts
were
such
as
win
the
approving
smile
of
old
judges
and
draw
from
them
the
prediction
that
young
man
will
rise
in
his
he
had
not
desired
to
make
any
display
of
his
knowledge
or
talent
but
merely
to
win
the
cases
confided
to
him
and
unlike
many
beginners
he
evinced
no
inclination
to
shine
at
his
clients
expense
rare
modesty
and
it
served
him
well
his
first
ten
months
of
practice
brought
him
about
eight
thousand
francs
absorbed
in
part
by
the
expense
attaching
to
a
suitable
office
the
second
year
his
fees
increased
by
about
and
feeling
that
his
position
was
now
assured
he
insisted
that
his
mother
should
resign
her
clerkship
he
proved
to
her
what
was
indeed
the
truth
that
by
superintending
his
establishment
she
would
save
more
than
she
made
in
her
present
position
from
that
time
the
mother
and
the
son
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
their
heroic
energy
had
conquered
fate
clients
became
so
numerous
that
pascal
found
it
necessary
to
draw
nearer
the
business
centre
and
his
rent
was
consequently
doubled
but
the
income
he
derived
from
his
profession
increased
so
rapidly
that
he
soon
had
twelve
thousand
francs
safely
invested
as
a
resource
against
any
emergency
madame
ferailleur
now
laid
aside
the
mourning
she
had
worn
since
her
husband
s
death
she
felt
that
she
owed
it
to
pascal
and
besides
after
believing
there
was
no
more
happiness
left
for
her
on
earth
her
heart
rejoiced
at
her
son
s
success
pascal
was
thus
on
the
to
fame
when
a
complication
in
ferdinand
de
coralth
s
affair
brought
that
young
nobleman
to
his
office
the
trouble
arose
from
a
little
stock
exchange
operation
which
ferdinand
had
engaged
in
an
affair
which
savored
a
trifle
of
knavery
it
was
strange
but
pascal
rather
took
a
liking
to
de
coralth
the
honest
worker
felt
interested
in
this
dashing
adventurer
he
was
almost
dazzled
by
his
brilliant
vices
his
wit
his
hardihood
conceit
marvellous
assurance
and
careless
impudence
and
he
studied
this
specimen
of
the
parisian
flora
with
no
little
curiosity
de
coralth
certainly
did
not
confide
the
secret
of
his
life
and
his
resources
to
pascal
but
the
latter
s
intelligence
should
have
told
him
to
distrust
a
man
who
treated
the
requirements
of
morality
even
more
than
cavalierly
and
who
had
infinitely
more
wants
than
scruples
however
the
young
advocate
seemed
to
have
no
suspicions
they
exchanged
visits
occasionally
and
it
was
pascal
himself
who
one
day
requested
the
viscount
to
take
him
to
one
of
those
reunions
in
high
life
which
the
newspapers
describe
in
such
glowing
terms
madame
ferailleur
was
playing
a
game
of
whist
with
a
party
of
old
friends
according
to
her
custom
every
thursday
evening
when
de
coralth
called
to
invite
the
young
advocate
to
accompany
him
to
madame
d
argeles
s
reception
pascal
considered
his
friend
s
invitation
exceedingly
well
timed
he
dressed
himself
with
more
than
ordinary
care
and
as
usual
before
going
out
he
approached
his
mother
to
kiss
her
and
wish
her
how
fine
you
are
she
said
smiling
i
am
going
to
a
soiree
my
dear
mother
he
replied
and
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
not
return
until
very
late
so
don
t
wait
for
me
i
beg
of
you
promise
me
to
go
to
bed
at
your
usual
have
you
the
very
well
then
i
will
not
wait
for
you
when
you
come
in
you
will
find
your
candle
and
some
matches
on
the
buffet
in
the
and
wrap
yourself
up
well
for
it
is
very
then
raising
her
forehead
to
her
son
s
lips
she
gayly
added
a
pleasant
evening
to
you
my
boy
faithful
to
her
promise
madame
ferailleur
retired
at
the
usual
hour
but
she
could
not
sleep
she
certainly
had
no
cause
for
anxiety
and
yet
the
thought
that
her
son
was
not
at
home
filled
her
heart
with
vague
misgivings
such
as
she
had
never
previously
felt
under
similar
circumstances
possibly
it
was
because
she
did
not
know
where
pascal
was
going
possibly
de
coralth
was
the
cause
of
her
strange
disquietude
for
she
utterly
disliked
the
viscount
her
woman
s
instinct
warned
her
that
there
was
something
unwholesome
about
this
young
man
s
peculiar
handsomeness
and
that
it
was
not
safe
to
trust
to
his
professions
of
friendship
at
all
events
she
lay
awake
and
heard
the
clock
of
the
neighboring
normal
school
strike
each
successive
hour
two
three
and
four
how
late
pascal
stays
she
said
to
herself
and
suddenly
a
fear
more
poignant
even
than
her
presentiments
darted
through
her
mind
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
rushed
to
the
window
she
fancied
she
had
heard
a
terrible
cry
of
distress
in
the
deserted
street
at
that
very
moment
the
insulting
word
thief
was
being
hurled
in
her
son
s
face
but
the
street
was
silent
and
deciding
that
she
had
been
mistaken
she
went
back
to
bed
laughing
at
herself
for
her
fears
and
at
last
she
fell
asleep
but
judge
of
her
terror
in
the
morning
when
on
rising
to
let
the
servant
in
she
saw
pascal
s
candle
still
standing
on
the
buffet
was
it
possible
that
he
had
not
returned
she
hastened
to
his
room
he
was
not
there
and
it
was
nearly
eight
o
clock
this
was
the
first
time
that
pascal
had
spent
a
night
from
home
without
warning
his
mother
in
advance
and
such
an
act
on
the
part
of
a
man
of
his
character
was
sufficient
proof
that
something
extraordinary
had
occurred
in
an
instant
all
the
dangers
that
lurk
in
paris
after
nightfall
flashed
through
her
mind
she
remembered
all
the
stories
she
had
read
of
men
decoyed
into
dark
corners
of
men
stabbed
at
the
turn
of
some
deserted
street
or
thrown
into
the
seine
while
crossing
one
of
the
bridges
what
should
she
do
her
first
impulse
was
to
run
to
the
commissary
of
police
s
office
or
to
the
house
of
pascal
s
friend
but
on
the
other
hand
she
dared
not
go
out
for
fear
he
might
return
in
her
absence
thus
in
an
agony
of
suspense
she
waited
counting
the
seconds
by
the
quick
throbbings
of
her
temples
and
straining
her
ears
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
at
last
about
eight
o
clock
she
heard
a
heavy
uncertain
footfall
on
the
stairs
she
flew
to
the
door
and
beheld
her
son
his
clothes
were
torn
and
disordered
his
cravat
was
missing
he
wore
no
overcoat
and
he
was
bareheaded
he
looked
very
pale
and
his
teeth
were
chattering
his
eyes
stared
vacantly
and
his
features
had
an
almost
idiotic
expression
pascal
what
has
happened
to
you
she
asked
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
as
the
sound
of
her
voice
suddenly
roused
him
from
his
stupor
nothing
he
stammered
nothing
at
and
as
his
mother
pressed
him
with
questions
he
pushed
her
gently
aside
and
went
on
to
his
room
poor
child
murmured
madame
ferailleur
at
once
grieved
and
reassured
and
he
is
always
so
temperate
some
one
must
have
forced
him
to
she
was
entirely
wrong
in
her
surmise
and
yet
pascal
s
sensations
were
exactly
like
those
of
an
intoxicated
man
how
he
had
returned
home
by
what
road
and
what
had
happened
on
the
way
he
could
not
tell
he
had
found
his
way
back
mechanically
merely
by
force
of
habit
physical
memory
as
it
might
be
called
he
had
a
vague
impression
however
that
he
had
sat
down
for
some
time
on
a
bench
in
the
that
he
had
felt
extremely
cold
and
that
he
had
been
accosted
by
a
policeman
who
threatened
him
with
arrest
if
he
did
not
move
on
the
last
thing
he
could
clearly
recollect
was
rushing
from
madame
d
argeles
s
house
in
the
rue
de
berry
he
knew
that
he
had
descended
the
staircase
slowly
and
deliberately
that
the
servants
in
the
vestibule
had
stood
aside
to
allow
him
to
pass
and
that
while
crossing
the
courtyard
he
had
thrown
away
the
candelabrum
with
which
he
had
defended
himself
after
that
he
remembered
nothing
distinctly
on
reaching
the
street
he
had
been
overcome
by
the
fresh
air
just
as
a
carouser
is
overcome
on
emerging
from
a
heated
perhaps
the
champagne
which
he
had
drank
had
contributed
to
this
cerebral
disorder
at
all
events
even
now
in
his
own
room
seated
in
his
own
and
surrounded
by
familiar
objects
he
did
not
succeed
in
regaining
the
possession
of
his
faculties
he
had
barely
strength
enough
to
throw
himself
on
to
the
bed
and
in
a
moment
he
was
sleeping
with
that
heavy
slumber
which
so
often
seizes
hold
of
one
on
the
occasion
of
a
great
crisis
and
which
has
so
frequently
been
observed
among
persons
condemned
to
death
on
the
night
preceding
their
execution
four
or
five
times
his
mother
came
to
listen
at
the
door
once
she
entered
and
seeing
her
son
sleeping
soundly
she
could
not
repress
a
smile
of
satisfaction
poor
pascal
she
thought
he
can
bear
no
excess
but
excess
of
work
heavens
how
surprised
and
mortified
he
will
be
when
he
awakes
alas
it
was
not
a
trifling
mortification
but
despair
which
awaited
the
sleeper
on
his
wakening
for
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
were
presented
simultaneously
and
visionlike
to
his
imagination
although
he
had
scarcely
regained
the
full
use
of
his
faculties
he
was
to
some
extent
at
least
capable
of
reflection
and
deliberation
and
he
tried
to
look
the
situation
bravely
in
the
face
first
as
to
the
past
he
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
he
realized
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
vile
trap
and
the
person
who
had
laid
it
for
him
was
undoubtedly
de
coralth
who
seated
at
his
right
had
prepared
the
hands
with
which
he
had
won
this
was
evident
it
seemed
equally
proven
that
madame
d
argeles
knew
the
real
culprit
possibly
she
had
detected
him
in
the
act
possibly
he
had
taken
her
into
his
confidence
but
what
he
could
not
fathom
was
de
coralth
s
motive
what
could
have
prompted
the
viscount
to
commit
such
an
atrocious
act
the
incentive
must
have
been
very
powerful
since
he
had
naturally
incurred
the
danger
of
detection
and
of
being
considered
an
accomplice
at
the
least
and
then
what
influence
had
closed
madame
d
argeles
s
lips
but
after
all
what
was
the
use
of
these
conjectures
it
was
an
actual
unanswerable
and
terrible
fact
that
this
infamous
plot
had
been
successful
and
that
pascal
was
dishonored
he
was
honesty
itself
and
yet
he
was
accused
more
than
that
convicted
of
cheating
at
cards
he
was
innocent
and
yet
he
could
furnish
no
proofs
of
his
innocence
he
knew
the
real
culprit
and
yet
he
could
see
no
way
of
unmasking
him
or
even
of
accusing
him
do
what
he
would
this
atrocious
incomprehensive
calumny
would
crush
him
the
bar
was
closed
against
him
his
career
was
ended
and
the
terrible
conviction
that
there
was
no
escape
from
the
abyss
into
which
he
had
fallen
made
his
reason
totter
he
felt
that
he
was
incapable
of
deciding
on
the
best
course
and
that
he
must
have
a
friend
s
advice
full
of
this
idea
he
hastily
changed
his
clothes
and
hurried
from
his
room
his
mother
was
watching
for
him
inclined
to
laugh
at
him
a
little
but
a
single
glance
warned
her
that
her
son
was
in
terrible
trouble
and
that
some
dire
misfortune
had
certainly
befallen
him
pascal
in
heaven
s
name
what
has
happened
she
cried
a
slight
difficulty
a
mere
trifle
he
replied
where
are
you
going
to
the
palais
de
and
such
was
really
the
case
for
he
hoped
to
meet
his
most
intimate
friend
there
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
he
took
the
little
staircase
on
the
right
leading
to
the
grand
vestibule
where
several
lawyers
were
assembled
earnestly
engaged
in
conversation
they
were
evidently
astonished
to
see
pascal
and
their
conversation
abruptly
ceased
on
his
approach
they
assumed
a
grave
look
and
turned
away
their
heads
in
disgust
the
unfortunate
man
at
once
realized
the
truth
and
pressed
his
hand
to
his
forehead
with
a
despairing
gesture
as
he
murmured
already
already
however
he
passed
on
and
not
seeing
his
friend
he
hurried
to
the
little
conference
hall
where
he
found
five
of
his
on
pascal
s
entrance
two
of
them
at
once
left
the
hall
while
two
of
the
others
pretended
to
be
very
busily
engaged
in
examining
a
brief
which
lay
open
on
the
table
the
fifth
who
did
not
move
was
not
the
friend
pascal
sought
but
an
old
college
comrade
named
dartelle
pascal
walked
straight
toward
him
well
he
asked
dartelle
handed
him
a
figaro
still
damp
from
the
but
crumpled
and
worn
as
if
it
had
already
passed
through
more
than
a
hundred
hands
read
said
he
pascal
read
as
follows
there
was
great
sensation
and
a
terrible
scandal
last
night
at
the
residence
of
madame
d
a
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
a
score
of
gentlemen
of
high
rank
and
immense
wealth
were
enjoying
a
quiet
game
of
baccarat
when
it
was
observed
that
f
was
winning
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
he
was
watched
and
detected
in
the
very
act
of
dexterously
slipping
some
cards
into
the
pack
he
held
crushed
by
the
overpowering
evidence
against
him
he
allowed
himself
to
be
searched
and
without
much
demur
consented
to
refund
the
fruit
of
his
knavery
to
the
amount
of
two
thousand
louis
the
strangest
thing
connected
with
this
scandal
is
that
f
who
is
an
advocate
by
profession
has
always
enjoyed
an
enviable
reputation
for
integrity
and
unfortunately
this
prank
can
not
be
attributed
to
a
momentary
fit
of
madness
for
the
fact
that
he
had
provided
himself
with
these
cards
in
advance
proves
the
act
to
have
been
premeditated
one
of
the
persons
present
was
especially
displeased
this
was
the
viscount
de
c
who
had
introduced
f
to
madame
d
a
extremely
annoyed
by
this
contretemps
he
took
umbrage
at
an
offensive
remark
made
by
de
r
and
it
was
rumored
that
these
gentlemen
would
cross
swords
at
daybreak
this
morning
later
we
learn
at
the
moment
of
going
to
press
that
an
encounter
has
just
taken
place
between
de
r
and
de
c
de
r
received
a
slight
wound
in
the
side
but
his
condition
is
sufficiently
satisfactory
not
to
alarm
his
the
paper
slipped
from
pascal
s
hand
his
features
were
almost
unrecognizable
in
his
passion
and
despair
it
is
an
infamous
lie
he
said
hoarsely
i
am
innocent
i
swear
it
upon
my
honor
dartelle
averted
his
face
but
not
quickly
enough
to
prevent
pascal
from
noticing
the
look
of
withering
scorn
in
his
eyes
then
feeling
that
he
was
condemned
that
his
sentence
was
irrevocable
and
that
there
was
no
longer
any
hope
i
know
the
only
thing
that
remains
for
me
to
do
he
murmured
dartelle
turned
his
eyes
glistening
with
tears
he
seized
pascal
s
hands
and
pressed
them
with
sorrowful
tenderness
as
if
taking
leave
of
a
friend
who
is
about
to
die
courage
he
whispered
pascal
fled
like
a
madman
yes
he
repeated
as
he
rushed
along
the
boulevard
that
is
the
only
thing
left
me
to
when
he
reached
home
he
entered
his
office
the
door
and
wrote
two
letters
one
to
his
mother
the
other
to
the
president
of
the
order
of
advocates
after
a
moment
s
thought
he
began
a
third
but
tore
it
into
pieces
before
he
had
completed
it
then
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
and
like
a
man
who
had
fully
decided
upon
his
course
he
took
a
revolver
and
a
box
of
cartridges
from
a
drawer
in
his
desk
poor
mother
he
murmured
it
will
kill
her
but
my
disgrace
would
kill
her
too
better
shorten
the
he
little
fancied
at
that
supreme
moment
that
each
of
his
gestures
each
contraction
of
his
features
were
viewed
by
the
mother
whose
name
he
faltered
since
her
son
had
left
her
to
go
to
the
palais
de
justice
the
poor
woman
had
remained
almost
crazy
with
anxiety
and
when
she
heard
him
return
and
lock
himself
in
his
office
a
thing
he
had
never
done
before
a
fearful
presentiment
was
aroused
in
her
mind
gliding
into
her
son
s
bedroom
she
at
once
approached
the
door
communicating
with
his
office
the
upper
part
of
this
portal
was
of
glass
it
was
possible
to
see
what
was
occurring
in
the
adjoining
room
when
madame
ferailleur
perceived
pascal
seat
himself
at
his
desk
and
begin
to
write
she
felt
a
trifle
reassured
and
almost
thought
of
going
away
but
a
vague
dread
stronger
than
reason
or
will
riveted
her
to
the
spot
a
few
moments
later
when
she
saw
the
revolver
in
her
son
s
hand
she
understood
everything
her
blood
froze
in
her
veins
and
yet
she
had
sufficient
to
repress
the
cry
of
terror
which
sprang
to
her
lips
she
realized
that
the
danger
was
terrible
imminent
extreme
her
heart
rather
than
her
bewildered
reason
told
her
that
her
son
s
life
hung
on
a
single
thread
the
slightest
sound
a
word
a
rap
on
the
door
might
hasten
the
unfortunate
man
s
deed
an
inspiration
from
heaven
came
to
the
poor
mother
pascal
had
contented
himself
with
locking
the
door
leading
to
the
he
had
forgotten
this
one
or
neglected
it
not
thinking
that
anybody
would
approach
his
office
through
his
bedroom
but
his
mother
perceived
that
this
door
opened
toward
her
so
turning
the
knob
with
the
utmost
caution
she
flung
it
suddenly
open
and
reaching
her
son
s
side
with
a
single
bound
she
clasped
him
closely
in
her
arms
pascal
wretched
boy
what
would
you
do
he
was
so
surprised
that
his
weapon
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
sank
back
almost
fainting
in
his
the
idea
of
denying
his
intention
never
once
occurred
to
him
besides
he
was
unable
to
articulate
a
word
but
on
his
desk
there
lay
a
letter
addressed
to
his
mother
which
would
speak
for
him
madame
ferailleur
took
it
tore
the
envelope
open
and
read
forgive
me
i
m
about
to
die
it
must
be
so
i
can
not
survive
dishonor
and
i
am
dishonored
you
exclaimed
the
heartbroken
mother
my
god
what
does
this
mean
speak
i
implore
you
tell
me
all
you
must
i
command
you
to
do
so
i
command
you
he
complied
with
this
at
once
supplicating
and
imperious
behest
and
related
in
a
despairing
voice
the
events
which
had
wrought
his
woe
he
did
not
omit
a
single
particular
but
tried
rather
to
exaggerate
than
palliate
the
horrors
of
his
situation
perhaps
he
found
a
strange
satisfaction
in
proving
to
himself
that
there
was
no
hope
left
possibly
he
believed
his
mother
would
say
yes
you
are
right
and
death
is
your
only
refuge
as
madame
ferailleur
listened
however
her
eyes
dilated
with
fear
and
horror
and
she
scarcely
realized
whether
she
were
awake
or
in
the
midst
of
some
frightful
dream
for
this
was
one
of
those
unexpected
catastrophes
which
are
beyond
the
range
of
human
foresight
or
even
imagination
and
which
her
mind
could
scarcely
conceive
or
admit
but
she
did
not
doubt
him
even
though
his
friends
had
doubted
him
indeed
if
he
had
himself
told
her
that
he
was
guilty
of
cheating
at
cards
she
would
have
refused
to
believe
him
when
his
story
was
ended
she
exclaimed
and
you
wished
to
kill
yourself
did
you
not
think
senseless
boy
that
your
death
would
give
an
appearance
of
truth
to
this
vile
calumny
with
a
mother
s
wonderful
sublime
instinct
she
had
found
the
most
powerful
reason
that
could
be
urged
to
induce
pascal
to
live
did
you
not
feel
my
son
that
it
showed
a
lack
of
courage
on
your
part
to
brand
yourself
and
your
name
with
eternal
infamy
in
order
to
escape
your
present
sufferings
this
thought
ought
to
have
stayed
your
hand
an
honest
name
is
a
sacred
trust
which
no
one
has
a
right
to
abuse
your
father
bequeathed
it
to
you
pure
and
untarnished
and
so
you
must
preserve
it
if
others
try
to
cover
it
with
opprobrium
you
must
live
to
defend
he
lowered
his
head
despondently
and
in
a
tone
of
profound
discouragement
he
replied
but
what
can
i
do
how
can
i
escape
from
the
web
which
has
been
woven
around
me
with
such
fiendish
cunning
if
i
had
possessed
my
usual
presence
of
mind
at
the
moment
of
the
accusation
i
might
have
defended
and
justified
myself
perhaps
but
now
the
misfortune
is
irreparable
how
can
i
unmask
the
traitor
and
what
proofs
of
his
guilt
can
i
cast
in
his
face
all
the
same
you
ought
not
to
yield
without
a
struggle
interrupted
madame
ferailleur
sternly
it
is
wrong
to
abandon
a
task
because
it
is
difficult
it
must
be
accepted
and
even
if
one
perish
in
the
struggle
there
is
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
one
has
not
failed
in
but
mother
i
must
not
keep
the
truth
from
you
pascal
what
are
you
lacking
in
energy
come
my
son
rise
and
raise
your
head
i
shall
not
let
you
fight
alone
i
will
fight
with
without
speaking
a
word
pascal
caught
hold
of
his
mother
s
hands
and
pressed
them
to
his
lips
his
face
was
wet
with
tears
his
overstrained
nerves
relaxed
under
the
soothing
influence
of
maternal
tenderness
and
devotion
reason
too
had
regained
her
ascendency
his
mother
s
noble
words
found
an
echo
in
his
own
heart
and
he
now
looked
upon
suicide
as
an
act
of
madness
and
cowardice
madame
ferailleur
felt
that
the
victory
was
assured
but
this
did
not
suffice
she
wished
to
enlist
pascal
in
her
plans
it
is
evident
she
resumed
that
de
coralth
is
the
author
of
this
abominable
plot
but
what
could
have
been
his
object
has
he
any
reason
to
fear
you
pascal
has
he
confided
to
you
or
have
you
discovered
any
secret
that
might
ruin
him
if
it
were
divulged
no
then
he
must
be
the
vile
instrument
of
some
even
more
despicable
being
reflect
my
son
have
you
wounded
any
of
your
friends
are
you
sure
that
you
are
in
nobody
s
way
consider
carefully
your
profession
has
its
dangers
and
those
who
adopt
it
must
expect
to
make
bitter
pascal
trembled
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
ray
of
light
at
last
illumined
the
darkness
a
dim
and
uncertain
ray
it
is
true
but
still
a
gleam
of
light
who
knows
he
muttered
who
knows
madame
ferailleur
reflected
a
few
moments
and
the
nature
of
her
reflections
brought
a
flush
to
her
brow
this
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
a
mother
should
overstep
reserve
said
she
if
you
had
a
mistress
my
son
i
have
none
he
answered
promptly
then
his
own
face
flushed
and
after
an
instant
s
hesitation
he
added
but
i
entertain
the
most
profound
and
reverent
love
for
a
young
girl
the
most
beautiful
and
chaste
being
on
earth
a
girl
who
in
intelligence
and
heart
is
worthy
of
you
my
own
madame
ferailleur
nodded
her
head
gravely
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
had
expected
to
find
a
woman
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
and
who
is
this
young
girl
she
inquired
what
is
her
name
marguerite
who
pascal
s
embarrassment
increased
she
has
no
other
name
he
replied
hurriedly
and
she
does
not
know
her
parents
she
formerly
lived
in
our
street
with
her
companion
madame
leon
and
an
old
female
servant
it
was
there
that
i
saw
her
for
the
first
time
she
now
lives
in
the
house
of
the
count
de
chalusse
in
the
rue
de
in
what
capacity
the
count
has
always
taken
care
of
her
she
owes
her
education
to
him
he
acts
as
her
guardian
and
although
she
has
never
spoken
to
me
on
the
subject
i
fancy
that
the
count
de
chalusse
is
her
and
does
this
girl
love
you
pascal
i
believe
so
mother
she
has
promised
me
that
she
will
have
no
other
husband
than
and
the
count
he
doesn
t
know
he
doesn
t
even
suspect
anything
about
it
day
after
day
i
have
been
trying
to
gather
courage
to
tell
you
everything
and
to
ask
you
to
go
to
the
count
de
chalusse
but
my
position
is
so
modest
as
yet
the
count
is
immensely
rich
and
he
intends
to
give
marguerite
an
enormous
fortune
two
millions
i
believe
madame
ferailleur
interrupted
him
with
a
gesture
look
no
further
she
said
you
have
found
the
pascal
sprang
to
his
feet
with
crimson
cheeks
flaming
eyes
and
quivering
lips
it
may
be
so
he
exclaimed
it
may
be
so
the
count
s
immense
fortune
may
have
tempted
some
miserable
scoundrel
who
knows
but
some
one
may
have
been
watching
marguerite
and
have
discovered
that
i
am
an
obstacle
something
told
me
that
my
suspicions
were
correct
said
madame
ferailleur
i
had
no
proofs
and
yet
i
felt
sure
of
pascal
was
absorbed
in
thought
and
what
a
strange
coincidence
he
eventually
remarked
do
you
know
the
last
time
i
saw
marguerite
a
week
ago
she
seemed
so
sad
and
anxious
that
i
felt
alarmed
i
questioned
her
but
at
first
she
would
not
answer
after
a
little
while
however
as
i
insisted
she
said
ah
well
i
fear
the
count
is
planning
a
marriage
for
me
de
chalusse
has
not
said
a
word
to
me
on
the
subject
but
he
has
recently
had
several
long
conferences
in
private
with
a
young
man
whose
father
rendered
him
a
great
service
in
former
years
and
this
young
man
whenever
i
meet
him
looks
at
me
in
such
a
peculiar
what
is
his
name
asked
madame
ferailleur
i
don
t
know
she
didn
t
mention
it
and
her
words
so
disturbed
me
that
i
did
not
think
of
asking
but
she
will
tell
me
this
evening
if
i
don
t
succeed
in
obtaining
an
interview
i
will
write
to
her
if
your
suspicions
are
correct
mother
our
secret
is
in
the
hands
of
three
persons
and
so
it
is
a
secret
no
longer
he
paused
suddenly
to
listen
the
noise
of
a
spirited
altercation
between
the
servant
and
some
visitor
came
from
the
i
tell
you
that
he
is
at
home
said
some
one
in
a
panting
voice
and
i
must
see
him
and
speak
with
him
at
once
it
is
such
an
urgent
matter
that
i
left
a
just
at
the
most
critical
moment
to
come
i
assure
you
monsieur
that
ferailleur
has
gone
very
well
i
will
wait
for
him
then
take
me
to
a
room
where
i
can
sit
pascal
turned
pale
for
he
recognized
the
voice
of
the
individual
who
had
suggested
searching
him
at
madame
d
argeles
s
house
nevertheless
he
opened
the
door
and
a
man
with
a
face
like
a
full
moon
and
who
was
puffing
and
panting
like
a
locomotive
came
forward
with
the
assurance
of
a
person
who
thinks
he
may
do
anything
he
chooses
by
reason
of
his
wealth
zounds
he
exclaimed
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
you
were
here
you
don
t
recognize
me
perhaps
my
dear
sir
i
am
baron
trigault
i
came
to
the
words
died
away
on
his
lips
and
he
became
as
embarrassed
as
if
he
had
not
possessed
an
income
of
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
the
fact
is
he
had
just
perceived
madame
ferailleur
he
bowed
to
her
and
then
with
a
significant
glance
at
pascal
he
said
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
in
private
monsieur
in
reference
to
a
matter
great
as
was
pascal
s
astonishment
he
showed
none
of
it
on
his
face
you
can
speak
in
my
mother
s
presence
he
replied
coldly
she
knows
the
baron
s
surprise
found
vent
in
a
positive
distortion
of
his
features
ah
said
he
in
three
different
tones
ah
ah
and
as
no
one
had
offered
him
a
seat
he
approached
an
and
took
possession
of
it
exclaiming
you
will
allow
me
i
trust
those
stairs
have
put
me
in
such
a
state
in
spite
of
his
unwieldy
appearance
this
wealthy
man
was
endowed
with
great
natural
shrewdness
and
an
unusually
active
mind
and
while
he
pretended
to
be
engaged
in
recovering
his
breath
he
studied
the
room
and
its
occupants
a
revolver
was
lying
on
the
floor
beside
a
torn
and
crumpled
letter
and
tears
were
still
glittering
in
the
eyes
of
madame
ferailleur
and
her
son
a
keen
observer
needed
no
further
explanation
of
the
scene
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
monsieur
began
the
baron
that
i
have
been
led
here
by
certain
compunctions
of
and
misinterpreting
a
gesture
which
pascal
made
i
mean
what
i
say
he
continued
compunctions
of
conscience
i
have
them
occasionally
your
departure
this
morning
after
that
deplorable
scene
caused
certain
doubts
and
suspicions
to
arise
in
my
mind
and
i
said
to
myself
we
have
been
too
hasty
perhaps
this
young
man
may
not
be
monsieur
interrupted
pascal
in
a
threatening
tone
excuse
me
allow
me
to
finish
if
you
please
reflection
i
must
confess
only
confirmed
this
impression
and
increased
my
doubts
the
devil
i
said
to
myself
again
if
this
young
man
is
innocent
the
culprit
must
be
one
of
the
habitues
of
madame
d
argeles
s
house
that
is
to
say
a
man
with
whom
i
play
twice
a
week
and
whom
i
shall
play
with
again
next
and
then
i
became
uneasy
and
here
i
am
was
the
absurd
reason
which
the
baron
gave
for
his
visit
the
true
one
it
was
difficult
to
decide
i
came
he
continued
thinking
that
a
look
at
your
home
would
teach
me
something
and
now
i
have
seen
it
i
am
ready
to
take
my
oath
that
you
are
the
victim
of
a
vile
so
saying
he
noisily
blew
his
nose
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
observing
the
quiet
joy
of
pascal
and
his
mother
they
were
amazed
but
although
these
words
were
calculated
to
make
them
feel
intensely
happy
they
still
looked
at
their
visitor
with
distrust
it
is
not
natural
for
a
person
to
interest
himself
in
other
people
s
misfortunes
unless
he
has
some
special
motive
for
doing
so
and
what
could
this
singular
man
s
object
be
however
he
did
not
seem
in
the
slightest
degree
disconcerted
by
the
glacial
reserve
with
which
his
advances
were
received
it
is
clear
that
you
are
in
some
one
s
way
he
resumed
and
that
this
some
one
has
invented
this
method
of
ruining
you
there
can
be
no
question
about
it
the
intention
became
manifest
to
my
mind
the
moment
i
read
the
paragraph
concerning
you
in
the
figaro
have
you
seen
it
yes
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
would
be
willing
to
swear
that
it
was
written
from
notes
furnished
by
your
enemy
moreover
the
particulars
are
incorrect
and
i
am
going
to
write
a
line
of
correction
which
i
shall
take
to
the
office
so
saying
he
transported
his
unwieldy
person
to
pascal
s
desk
and
hastily
wrote
as
follows
mr
editor
as
a
witness
of
the
scene
that
took
place
at
madame
d
a
s
s
house
last
night
allow
me
to
make
an
important
correction
it
is
only
too
true
that
extra
cards
were
introduced
into
the
pack
but
that
they
were
introduced
by
f
is
not
proven
since
he
was
not
seen
to
do
it
i
know
that
appearances
are
against
him
but
he
nevertheless
possesses
my
entire
confidence
and
esteem
baron
meanwhile
madame
ferailleur
and
her
son
had
exchanged
significant
glances
their
impressions
were
the
same
this
man
could
not
be
an
enemy
when
the
baron
had
finished
his
letter
and
had
read
it
aloud
pascal
who
was
deeply
moved
exclaimed
i
do
not
know
how
to
express
my
gratitude
to
you
monsieur
but
if
you
really
wish
to
serve
me
pray
don
t
send
that
note
it
would
cause
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
annoyance
and
i
should
none
the
less
be
obliged
to
relinquish
the
practice
of
my
profession
besides
i
am
especially
anxious
to
be
forgotten
for
a
so
be
it
i
understand
you
you
hope
to
discover
the
traitor
and
you
do
not
wish
to
put
him
on
his
guard
i
approve
of
your
prudence
but
remember
my
words
if
you
ever
need
a
helping
hand
rap
at
my
door
and
when
you
hold
the
necessary
proofs
i
will
furnish
you
with
the
means
of
rendering
your
justification
even
more
startling
than
the
he
prepared
to
go
but
before
crossing
the
threshold
he
turned
and
said
in
future
i
shall
watch
the
fingers
of
the
player
who
sits
on
my
left
hand
and
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
obtain
the
notes
from
which
that
newspaper
article
was
written
one
never
knows
the
benefit
that
may
be
derived
at
a
certain
moment
from
a
page
of
as
he
started
off
madame
ferailleur
sprang
from
her
chair
pascal
she
exclaimed
that
man
knows
something
and
your
enemies
are
his
i
read
it
in
his
eyes
he
too
distrusts
de
i
understood
him
mother
and
my
mind
is
made
up
i
must
disappear
from
this
moment
pascal
ferailleur
no
longer
that
same
evening
two
large
vans
were
standing
outside
madame
ferailleur
s
house
she
had
sold
her
furniture
without
reserve
and
was
starting
to
join
her
son
who
had
already
left
for
le
havre
she
said
in
view
of
sailing
to
america
vi
there
are
a
number
of
patients
waiting
for
me
i
will
drop
in
again
about
midnight
i
still
have
several
urgent
visits
to
thus
had
jodon
spoken
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
yet
when
he
left
the
hotel
de
chalusse
after
assuring
himself
that
casimir
would
have
some
straw
spread
over
the
street
the
doctor
quietly
walked
home
the
visits
he
had
spoken
of
merely
existed
in
his
imagination
but
it
was
a
part
of
his
role
to
appear
to
be
overrun
with
patients
to
tell
the
truth
the
only
patient
he
had
had
to
attend
to
that
week
was
a
superannuated
porter
living
in
the
rue
de
la
pepiniere
and
whom
he
visited
twice
a
day
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
the
remainder
of
his
time
was
spent
in
waiting
for
patients
who
never
came
and
in
cursing
the
profession
of
medicine
which
was
ruined
he
declared
by
excessive
competition
combined
with
certain
rules
of
decorum
which
hampered
young
practitioners
beyond
endurance
however
if
jodon
had
devoted
of
the
time
he
spent
in
cursing
and
building
castles
in
the
air
to
study
he
might
have
perhaps
raised
his
little
skill
to
the
height
of
his
immense
ambition
but
neither
work
nor
patience
formed
any
part
of
his
system
he
was
a
man
of
the
present
age
and
wished
to
rise
speedily
with
as
little
trouble
as
possible
a
certain
amount
of
display
and
assurance
a
little
luck
and
a
good
deal
of
advertising
would
in
his
opinion
suffice
to
bring
about
this
result
it
was
with
this
conviction
indeed
that
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
the
rue
de
courcelles
situated
in
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
quarters
of
paris
but
so
far
events
had
shown
his
theory
to
be
incorrect
in
spite
of
the
greatest
economy
very
cleverly
concealed
he
had
seen
the
little
capital
which
constituted
his
entire
fortune
dwindle
away
he
had
originally
possessed
but
twenty
thousand
francs
a
sum
which
in
no
wise
corresponded
with
his
lofty
pretensions
he
had
paid
his
rent
that
very
morning
and
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
time
was
near
at
hand
when
he
would
be
unable
to
pay
it
what
should
he
do
then
when
he
thought
of
this
contingency
and
it
was
a
subject
that
filled
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
matters
he
felt
the
fires
of
wrath
and
hatred
kindle
in
his
soul
he
utterly
refused
to
regard
himself
as
the
cause
of
his
own
misfortunes
on
the
contrary
following
the
example
of
many
other
disappointed
individuals
he
railed
at
mankind
and
everything
in
general
at
circumstances
envious
acquaintances
and
enemies
whom
he
certainly
did
not
possess
at
times
he
was
capable
of
doing
almost
anything
to
gratify
his
lust
for
gold
for
the
privations
which
he
had
endured
so
long
were
like
oil
cast
upon
the
flame
of
covetousness
which
was
ever
burning
in
his
breast
in
calmer
moments
he
asked
himself
at
what
other
door
he
could
knock
in
view
of
hastening
the
arrival
of
fortune
sometimes
he
thought
of
turning
dentist
or
of
trying
to
find
some
capitalist
who
would
join
him
in
manufacturing
one
of
those
patent
medicines
which
are
warranted
to
yield
their
promoters
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
on
other
occasions
he
dreamed
of
establishing
a
monster
pharmacy
or
of
opening
a
private
hospital
but
money
was
needed
to
carry
out
any
one
of
these
plans
and
he
had
no
money
there
was
the
rub
however
the
time
was
fast
approaching
when
he
must
decide
upon
his
course
he
could
not
possibly
hold
out
much
longer
his
third
year
of
practice
in
the
rue
de
courcelles
had
not
yielded
him
enough
to
pay
his
servant
s
wages
for
he
had
a
servant
of
course
he
had
a
valet
for
the
same
reason
as
he
had
a
suite
of
rooms
of
a
superficially
sumptuous
aspect
faithful
to
his
system
or
rather
to
his
master
s
system
he
had
sacrificed
everything
to
show
the
display
of
gilding
in
his
apartments
was
such
as
to
make
a
man
of
taste
shut
his
eyes
to
escape
the
sight
of
it
there
were
gorgeous
carpets
and
hangings
frescoed
ceilings
spurious
objects
of
virtu
and
loaded
with
ornaments
an
unsophisticated
youth
from
the
country
would
certainly
have
been
dazzled
but
it
would
not
do
to
examine
these
things
too
closely
there
was
more
cotton
than
silk
in
the
velvet
covering
of
the
furniture
and
if
various
statuettes
placed
on
brackets
at
a
certain
height
had
been
closely
inspected
it
would
have
been
found
that
they
were
of
mere
plaster
hidden
beneath
a
coating
of
green
paint
sprinkled
with
copper
filings
this
plaster
playing
the
part
of
bronze
was
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
man
his
system
and
the
present
age
when
the
doctor
reached
home
his
first
question
to
his
servant
was
as
usual
has
any
one
called
no
the
doctor
sighed
and
passing
through
his
superb
he
entered
his
consulting
sanctum
and
seated
himself
in
the
chimney
corner
beside
an
infinitesimal
fire
he
was
even
more
thoughtful
than
usual
the
scene
which
he
had
just
witnessed
at
the
count
de
chalusse
s
house
recurred
to
his
mind
and
he
turned
it
over
and
over
again
in
his
brain
striving
to
find
some
way
by
which
he
might
derive
an
advantage
from
the
mystery
for
he
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
there
was
a
mystery
he
had
been
engrossed
in
these
thoughts
for
some
time
when
his
meditations
were
disturbed
by
a
ring
at
the
bell
who
could
be
calling
at
this
hour
the
question
was
answered
by
his
servant
who
appeared
and
informed
him
that
a
lady
who
was
in
a
great
hurry
was
waiting
in
the
very
well
was
his
reply
but
it
is
best
to
let
her
wait
a
few
for
he
had
at
least
this
merit
he
never
deviated
from
his
system
under
no
circumstances
whatever
would
he
have
admitted
a
patient
immediately
he
wished
him
to
wait
so
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
reflecting
on
the
advantages
of
consulting
a
physician
whose
time
was
constantly
occupied
however
when
ten
minutes
or
so
had
elapsed
he
opened
the
door
and
a
tall
lady
came
quickly
forward
throwing
back
the
veil
which
had
concealed
her
face
she
must
have
been
over
and
if
she
had
ever
been
handsome
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
it
now
she
had
brown
hair
thickly
sprinkled
with
gray
but
very
coarse
and
abundant
and
growing
low
over
her
forehead
her
nose
was
broad
and
flat
her
lips
were
thick
and
her
eyes
were
dull
and
expressionless
however
her
manners
were
gentle
and
rather
melancholy
and
one
would
have
judged
her
to
be
somewhat
of
a
devotee
still
for
the
time
being
she
seemed
greatly
agitated
she
seated
herself
at
the
doctor
s
invitation
and
without
waiting
for
him
to
ask
any
questions
i
ought
to
tell
you
at
once
monsieur
she
began
that
i
am
the
count
de
chalusse
s
in
spite
of
his
the
doctor
bounded
from
his
chair
madame
leon
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
intense
surprise
she
bowed
compressing
her
thick
lips
i
am
known
by
that
name
yes
monsieur
but
it
is
only
my
christian
name
the
one
i
have
a
right
to
bear
would
not
accord
with
my
present
position
reverses
of
fortune
are
not
rare
in
these
days
and
were
it
not
for
the
consoling
influences
of
religion
one
would
not
have
strength
to
endure
the
physician
was
greatly
puzzled
what
can
she
want
of
me
he
thought
meanwhile
she
had
resumed
speaking
i
was
much
reduced
in
circumstances
at
the
end
of
my
resources
indeed
when
de
chalusse
a
family
friend
requested
me
to
act
as
companion
to
a
young
girl
in
whom
he
was
interested
mademoiselle
marguerite
i
accepted
the
position
and
i
thank
god
every
day
that
i
did
so
for
i
feel
a
mother
s
affection
for
this
young
girl
and
she
loves
me
as
fondly
as
if
she
were
my
own
in
support
of
her
assertion
she
drew
a
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
and
succeeded
in
forcing
a
few
tears
to
her
eyes
under
these
circumstances
doctor
she
continued
you
can
not
fail
to
understand
that
the
interests
of
my
dearly
beloved
marguerite
bring
me
to
you
i
was
shut
up
in
my
own
room
when
de
chalusse
was
brought
home
and
i
did
not
hear
of
his
illness
until
after
your
departure
perhaps
you
might
say
that
i
ought
to
have
waited
until
your
next
visit
but
i
had
not
sufficient
patience
to
do
so
one
can
not
submit
without
a
struggle
to
the
torture
of
suspense
when
the
future
of
a
beloved
daughter
is
at
stake
so
here
i
she
paused
to
take
breath
and
then
added
i
have
come
monsieur
to
ask
you
to
tell
me
the
exact
truth
respecting
the
count
s
the
doctor
was
expecting
something
very
different
but
nevertheless
he
replied
with
all
due
gravity
and
it
is
my
painful
duty
to
tell
you
madame
that
there
is
scarcely
any
hope
and
that
i
expect
a
fatal
termination
within
hours
unless
the
patient
should
regain
the
housekeeper
turned
pale
then
all
is
lost
she
faltered
all
is
lost
and
unable
to
articulate
another
word
she
rose
to
her
feet
bowed
and
abruptly
left
the
room
before
the
grate
with
his
mouth
half
open
and
his
right
arm
extended
in
an
interrupted
gesture
the
doctor
stood
speechless
and
disconcerted
it
was
only
when
the
outer
door
closed
with
a
bang
that
he
seemed
restored
to
consciousness
and
as
he
heard
the
noise
he
sprang
forward
as
if
to
recall
his
visitor
ah
he
exclaimed
with
an
oath
the
miserable
old
woman
was
mocking
me
and
urged
on
by
a
wild
irrational
impulse
he
caught
up
his
hat
and
darted
out
in
pursuit
madame
leon
was
considerably
in
advance
of
him
and
was
walking
very
quickly
still
by
quickening
his
pace
he
might
have
overtaken
her
however
he
did
not
join
her
for
he
scarcely
knew
what
excuse
to
offer
for
such
a
strange
proceeding
he
contented
himself
by
cautiously
following
her
at
a
little
distance
suddenly
she
stopped
short
it
was
in
front
of
a
tobacconist
s
shop
where
there
was
a
the
shop
was
closed
but
the
box
was
there
with
its
little
slit
for
letters
to
be
dropped
into
it
madame
leon
evidently
hesitated
she
paused
as
one
always
does
before
venturing
upon
a
decisive
act
from
which
there
will
be
no
return
whatever
may
be
the
consequences
an
observer
never
remains
twenty
minutes
before
a
without
witnessing
this
pantomime
so
expressive
of
irresolution
at
last
however
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
gesture
which
eloquently
expressed
the
result
of
her
deliberations
and
drawing
a
letter
from
her
bosom
she
dropped
it
into
the
box
and
then
hastened
on
more
quickly
than
before
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
thought
the
doctor
that
letter
had
been
prepared
in
advance
and
whether
it
should
be
sent
or
not
depended
on
the
answer
i
we
have
already
said
that
jodon
was
not
a
wealthy
man
and
yet
he
would
willingly
have
given
a
note
to
have
known
the
contents
of
this
letter
or
even
the
name
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
but
his
chase
was
almost
ended
madame
leon
had
reached
the
hotel
de
chalusse
and
now
went
in
should
he
follow
her
his
curiosity
was
torturing
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
had
an
idea
of
doing
so
and
it
required
an
heroic
effort
of
will
to
resist
the
temptation
successfully
but
a
gleam
of
common
sense
warned
him
that
this
would
be
a
terrible
blunder
once
already
during
the
evening
his
conduct
had
attracted
attention
and
he
began
to
realize
that
there
was
a
better
way
of
winning
confidence
than
by
intruding
almost
forcibly
into
other
people
s
affairs
accordingly
he
thoughtfully
retraced
his
steps
feeling
intensely
disgusted
with
himself
what
a
fool
i
am
he
grumbled
if
i
had
kept
the
old
woman
in
suspense
instead
of
blurting
out
the
truth
i
might
have
learned
the
real
object
of
her
visit
for
she
had
an
object
but
what
was
it
the
doctor
spent
the
two
hours
that
remained
to
him
before
making
his
second
visit
in
trying
to
discover
it
but
although
nothing
prevented
him
from
exploring
the
boundless
fields
of
improbable
possibilities
he
could
think
of
nothing
satisfactory
there
was
only
one
certain
point
that
madame
leon
and
mademoiselle
marguerite
were
equally
interested
in
the
question
as
to
whether
the
count
would
regain
consciousness
or
not
as
to
their
interests
in
the
matter
the
doctor
felt
confident
that
they
were
not
identical
he
was
persuaded
that
a
secret
enmity
existed
between
them
and
that
the
housekeeper
had
visited
him
without
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
knowledge
for
he
was
not
deceived
by
madame
leon
or
by
her
pretended
devotion
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
her
manner
her
smooth
words
her
tone
of
pious
resignation
and
the
allusion
to
the
grand
name
she
had
the
right
to
bear
were
all
calculated
to
impose
upon
one
but
she
had
been
too
much
disconcerted
toward
the
last
to
remember
her
part
jodon
lacked
the
courage
to
return
to
his
sumptuous
rooms
and
it
was
in
a
little
cafe
that
he
thus
reflected
upon
the
situation
while
drinking
some
execrable
beer
brewed
in
paris
out
of
a
glass
manufactured
in
bavaria
at
last
midnight
sounded
the
hour
had
come
still
the
doctor
did
not
move
having
been
obliged
to
wait
himself
he
wished
in
revenge
to
make
the
others
wait
and
it
was
not
until
the
cafe
closed
that
he
again
walked
up
the
rue
de
courcelles
madame
leon
had
left
the
gate
ajar
and
the
doctor
had
no
difficulty
in
making
his
way
into
the
courtyard
as
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
the
servants
were
assembled
in
the
concierge
s
lodge
but
the
careless
gayety
which
shone
upon
their
faces
a
few
hours
before
had
given
place
to
evident
anxiety
respecting
their
future
prospects
through
the
windows
of
the
lodge
they
could
be
seen
standing
round
the
two
choice
spirits
of
the
household
bourigeau
the
concierge
and
casimir
the
valet
who
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
and
if
the
doctor
had
listened
he
would
have
heard
such
words
as
wages
and
legacies
and
remuneration
for
faithful
service
and
annuities
repeated
over
and
over
again
but
jodon
did
not
listen
thinking
he
should
find
some
servant
inside
he
entered
the
house
however
there
was
nobody
to
announce
his
presence
the
door
closed
noiselessly
behind
him
the
heavy
carpet
which
covered
the
marble
steps
stifled
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
and
he
ascended
the
first
flight
without
seeing
any
one
the
door
opening
into
the
count
s
room
was
open
the
room
itself
being
brilliantly
lighted
by
a
large
fire
and
a
lamp
which
stood
on
a
corner
of
the
instinctively
the
doctor
paused
and
looked
in
there
had
been
no
change
since
his
first
visit
the
count
was
still
lying
motionless
on
his
pillows
his
face
was
swollen
his
eyelids
were
closed
but
he
still
breathed
as
was
shown
by
the
regular
movement
of
the
covering
over
his
chest
madame
leon
and
mademoiselle
marguerite
were
his
only
attendants
the
housekeeper
who
sat
back
a
little
in
the
shade
was
half
reclining
in
an
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
her
lips
firmly
compressed
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
vacancy
pale
but
calm
and
more
imposing
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
kneeling
beside
the
bed
eagerly
watching
for
some
sign
of
renewed
life
and
intelligence
on
the
count
s
face
a
little
ashamed
of
his
indiscretion
the
doctor
retreated
seven
or
eight
steps
down
the
stairs
and
then
ascended
them
again
coughing
slightly
so
as
to
announce
his
approach
this
time
he
was
heard
for
mademoiselle
marguerite
came
to
the
door
to
meet
him
well
he
inquired
alas
he
advanced
toward
the
bed
but
before
he
had
time
to
examine
his
patient
mademoiselle
marguerite
handed
him
a
scrap
of
paper
the
physician
who
usually
attends
de
chalusse
has
been
here
in
your
absence
monsieur
said
she
this
is
his
prescription
and
we
have
already
administered
a
few
drops
of
the
jodon
who
was
expecting
this
blow
bowed
coldly
i
must
add
continued
mademoiselle
marguerite
that
the
doctor
approved
of
all
that
had
been
done
and
i
beg
you
will
unite
your
skill
with
his
in
treating
the
unfortunately
all
the
medical
skill
of
the
faculty
would
have
availed
nothing
here
after
another
examination
jodon
declared
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
wait
for
the
action
of
nature
but
that
he
must
be
informed
of
the
slightest
change
in
the
sick
man
s
condition
and
i
will
tell
my
servant
to
wake
me
at
once
if
i
am
sent
for
he
added
he
was
already
leaving
the
room
when
madame
leon
barred
his
passage
isn
t
it
true
doctor
that
one
attentive
person
would
suffice
to
watch
over
the
count
she
asked
most
assuredly
he
answered
the
housekeeper
turned
toward
mademoiselle
marguerite
ah
you
see
my
dear
young
lady
she
said
what
did
i
tell
you
listen
to
me
take
a
little
rest
watching
is
not
suitable
work
for
one
of
your
age
it
is
useless
to
insist
interrupted
the
young
girl
resolutely
i
shall
remain
here
i
shall
watch
over
him
the
housekeeper
made
no
reply
but
it
seemed
to
the
doctor
that
the
two
women
exchanged
singular
glances
the
devil
he
muttered
as
he
took
his
departure
one
might
think
that
they
distrusted
each
other
perhaps
he
was
right
but
at
all
events
he
had
scarcely
left
the
house
before
madame
leon
again
urged
her
dear
young
lady
to
take
a
few
hours
rest
what
can
you
fear
she
insisted
in
her
wheedling
voice
sha
n
t
i
be
here
do
you
suppose
your
old
leon
capable
of
losing
herself
in
sleep
when
your
future
depends
upon
a
word
from
that
poor
man
lying
there
pray
ah
no
my
dear
young
lady
my
love
for
you
compels
oh
enough
interrupted
mademoiselle
marguerite
enough
leon
her
tone
was
so
determined
that
the
housekeeper
was
compelled
to
yield
but
not
without
a
deep
sigh
not
without
an
imploring
glance
to
heaven
as
if
calling
upon
providence
to
witness
the
purity
of
her
motives
and
the
usefulness
of
her
praiseworthy
efforts
at
least
my
dear
lady
wrap
yourself
up
warmly
shall
i
go
and
bring
you
your
heavy
travelling
shawl
thanks
my
dear
leon
annette
will
bring
then
pray
send
for
it
but
we
are
not
going
to
watch
alone
what
should
we
do
if
we
needed
anything
i
will
call
replied
marguerite
this
was
unnecessary
for
jodon
s
departure
from
the
house
had
put
an
abrupt
termination
to
the
servants
conference
and
they
were
now
assembled
on
the
landing
anxious
and
breathless
and
peering
eagerly
into
the
mademoiselle
marguerite
went
toward
them
madame
leon
and
myself
will
remain
with
the
count
she
said
annette
this
was
the
woman
whom
she
liked
best
of
all
the
servants
casimir
and
a
footman
will
spend
the
night
in
the
little
side
salon
the
others
may
her
orders
were
obeyed
two
o
clock
sounded
from
the
near
by
and
then
the
solemn
and
terrible
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
hard
breathing
of
the
unconscious
man
and
the
implacable
ticktack
of
the
clock
on
the
numbering
the
seconds
which
were
left
for
him
to
live
from
the
streets
outside
not
a
sound
reached
this
princely
abode
which
stood
between
a
vast
courtyard
and
a
garden
as
large
as
a
park
moreover
the
straw
which
had
been
spread
over
the
effectually
deadened
the
rumble
of
the
few
vehicles
that
passed
enveloped
in
a
soft
warm
shawl
madame
leon
had
again
taken
possession
of
her
and
while
she
pretended
to
be
reading
a
she
kept
a
close
watch
over
her
dear
young
lady
as
if
she
were
striving
to
discover
her
thoughts
mademoiselle
marguerite
did
not
suspect
this
affectionate
espionage
besides
what
would
it
have
mattered
to
her
she
had
rolled
a
low
near
the
bedside
seated
herself
in
it
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
de
chalusse
two
or
three
times
she
started
violently
and
once
even
she
said
to
madame
leon
come
come
and
see
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
a
faint
change
in
the
patient
s
face
but
it
was
only
a
fancy
she
had
been
deceived
by
the
shadows
that
played
about
the
room
caused
by
the
capricious
flame
in
the
grate
the
hours
were
creeping
on
and
the
housekeeper
wearying
at
last
of
her
fruitless
watch
dropped
asleep
her
head
fell
forward
on
to
her
breast
her
slipped
from
her
hands
and
finally
she
began
to
snore
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
did
not
perceive
this
absorbed
as
she
was
in
thoughts
which
by
reason
of
their
very
profundity
had
ceased
to
be
sorrowful
perhaps
she
felt
she
was
keeping
a
last
vigil
over
her
happiness
and
that
with
the
final
breath
of
this
dying
man
all
her
girlhood
s
dreams
and
all
her
dearest
hopes
would
take
flight
for
evermore
undoubtedly
her
thoughts
flew
to
the
man
to
whom
she
had
promised
her
life
to
pascal
to
the
unfortunate
fellow
whose
honor
was
being
stolen
from
him
at
that
very
moment
in
a
fashionable
about
five
o
clock
the
air
became
so
close
that
she
felt
a
sudden
faintness
and
opened
the
window
to
obtain
a
breath
of
fresh
air
the
noise
aroused
madame
leon
from
her
slumbers
she
rose
yawned
and
rather
sullenly
declared
that
she
felt
very
queer
and
would
certainly
fall
ill
if
she
did
not
take
some
refreshment
it
became
necessary
to
summon
casimir
who
brought
her
a
glass
of
madeira
and
some
biscuits
now
i
feel
better
she
murmured
after
her
repast
my
excessive
sensibility
will
be
the
death
of
and
so
saying
she
dropped
asleep
again
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
meanwhile
returned
to
her
seat
but
her
thoughts
gradually
became
confused
her
eyelids
grew
heavy
and
although
she
struggled
she
at
last
fell
asleep
in
her
turn
with
her
head
resting
on
the
count
s
bed
it
was
daylight
when
a
strange
and
terrible
shock
awoke
her
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
an
icy
hand
some
dead
person
s
hand
was
gently
stroking
her
head
and
tenderly
caressing
her
hair
she
at
once
sprang
to
her
feet
the
sick
man
had
regained
consciousness
his
eyes
were
open
and
his
right
arm
was
moving
mademoiselle
marguerite
darted
to
the
and
pulled
it
violently
and
as
a
servant
appeared
in
answer
to
the
summons
she
cried
run
for
the
physician
who
lives
near
here
quick
and
tell
him
that
the
count
is
in
an
instant
almost
the
was
full
of
servants
but
the
girl
did
not
perceive
it
she
had
approached
de
chalusse
and
taking
his
hand
she
tenderly
asked
you
hear
me
do
you
not
monsieur
do
you
understand
me
his
lips
moved
but
only
a
hollow
rattling
sound
which
was
absolutely
unintelligible
came
from
his
throat
still
he
understood
her
as
it
was
easy
to
see
by
his
gestures
despairing
and
painful
ones
for
paralysis
had
not
released
its
hold
on
its
victim
and
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
he
could
slightly
move
his
right
arm
he
evidently
desired
something
but
what
they
mentioned
the
different
articles
in
the
room
everything
indeed
that
they
could
think
of
but
in
vain
until
the
housekeeper
suddenly
exclaimed
he
wishes
to
that
was
indeed
what
he
desired
with
the
hand
that
was
comparatively
free
with
the
hoarse
rattle
that
was
his
only
voice
de
chalusse
answered
yes
yes
and
his
eyes
even
turned
to
madame
leon
with
an
expression
of
joy
and
gratitude
they
raised
him
on
his
pillows
and
brought
him
a
small
with
some
paper
and
a
pen
that
had
been
dipped
in
ink
but
like
those
around
him
he
had
himself
his
strength
if
he
could
move
his
hand
he
could
not
control
its
movements
after
a
terrible
effort
and
intense
suffering
however
he
succeeded
in
tracing
a
few
words
the
meaning
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
understand
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
these
words
could
be
deciphered
my
entire
fortune
give
friends
against
this
signified
nothing
in
despair
he
dropped
the
pen
and
his
glance
and
his
hand
turned
to
that
part
of
the
room
opposite
his
bed
monsieur
means
his
escritoire
perhaps
yes
yes
the
sick
man
hoarsely
answered
perhaps
the
count
wishes
that
it
should
be
opened
yes
yes
was
the
reply
again
my
god
exclaimed
mademoiselle
marguerite
with
a
gesture
of
despair
what
have
i
done
i
have
broken
the
key
i
feared
the
responsibility
which
would
fall
upon
us
the
expression
of
the
count
s
face
had
become
absolutely
frightful
it
indicated
utter
discouragement
the
most
bitter
suffering
the
most
horrible
despair
his
soul
was
writhing
in
a
body
from
which
life
had
fled
intelligence
mind
and
will
were
fast
bound
in
a
corpse
which
they
could
not
electrify
the
consciousness
of
his
own
powerlessness
caused
him
a
paroxysm
of
frantic
rage
his
hands
clinched
the
veins
in
his
throat
swelled
his
eyes
almost
started
from
their
sockets
and
in
a
harsh
shrill
voice
that
had
nothing
human
in
it
he
exclaimed
marguerite
despoiled
take
care
your
mother
and
this
was
all
it
was
the
supreme
effort
that
broke
the
last
link
that
bound
the
soul
to
earth
a
priest
cried
madame
leon
a
priest
in
the
name
of
heaven
go
for
a
priest
rather
for
a
notary
suggested
casimir
you
see
he
wishes
to
make
a
but
at
that
moment
the
physician
entered
pale
and
breathless
he
walked
straight
to
the
bedside
glanced
at
the
motionless
form
and
solemnly
exclaimed
the
count
de
chalusse
is
dead
there
was
a
moment
s
stupor
the
stupor
which
always
follows
death
especially
when
death
comes
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
a
feeling
of
mingled
wonder
selfishness
and
fear
pervaded
the
group
of
servants
yes
it
is
over
muttered
the
doctor
it
is
all
over
and
as
he
was
familiar
with
these
painful
scenes
and
had
lost
none
of
his
he
furtively
studied
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
features
and
attitude
she
seemed
thunderstruck
with
dry
fixed
eyes
and
contracted
features
she
stood
rooted
to
her
place
gazing
at
the
lifeless
form
as
if
she
were
expecting
some
miracle
as
if
she
still
hoped
to
hear
those
rigid
lips
reveal
the
secret
which
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
disclose
and
which
he
had
carried
with
him
to
the
grave
the
physician
was
the
only
person
who
observed
this
the
other
occupants
of
the
room
were
exchanging
looks
of
distress
some
of
the
women
had
fallen
upon
their
knees
and
were
sobbing
and
praying
in
the
same
breath
but
madame
leon
s
sobs
could
be
heard
above
the
rest
they
were
at
first
inarticulate
moans
but
suddenly
she
sprang
toward
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
clasping
her
in
her
arms
she
cried
what
a
misfortune
my
dearest
child
what
a
loss
utterly
incapable
of
uttering
a
word
the
poor
girl
tried
to
free
herself
from
this
close
embrace
but
the
housekeeper
would
not
be
repulsed
and
continued
weep
my
dear
young
lady
weep
do
not
refuse
to
give
vent
to
your
she
herself
displayed
so
little
that
the
physician
reprimanded
her
with
considerable
severity
whereat
her
emotion
increased
and
with
her
handkerchief
pressed
to
her
eyes
she
sobbed
yes
doctor
yes
you
are
right
i
ought
to
moderate
my
grief
but
pray
doctor
remove
my
beloved
marguerite
from
this
scene
which
is
too
terrible
for
her
young
and
tender
heart
persuade
her
to
retire
to
her
own
room
so
that
she
may
ask
god
for
strength
to
bear
the
misfortune
which
has
befallen
the
poor
girl
had
certainly
no
intention
of
leaving
the
room
but
before
she
could
say
so
casimir
stepped
forward
i
think
he
dryly
observed
that
mademoiselle
had
better
remain
eh
said
madame
leon
looking
up
suddenly
and
why
if
you
please
because
because
anger
had
dried
the
housekeeper
s
tears
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
do
you
pretend
to
prevent
mademoiselle
from
doing
as
she
chooses
in
her
own
house
casimir
gave
vent
to
a
contemptuous
whistle
which
hours
earlier
would
have
been
punished
with
a
heavy
blow
from
the
man
who
was
now
lying
there
dead
her
own
house
he
answered
her
own
house
yesterday
i
shouldn
t
have
denied
it
but
it
s
quite
another
thing
is
she
a
relative
no
she
isn
t
what
are
you
talking
about
then
we
are
all
equals
he
spoke
so
impudently
that
even
the
doctor
felt
indignant
scoundrel
said
he
but
the
valet
turned
toward
him
with
an
air
which
proved
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
doctor
s
servant
and
consequently
with
all
the
secrets
of
the
master
s
life
call
your
own
valet
a
scoundrel
if
you
choose
he
retorted
but
not
me
your
duties
here
are
over
aren
t
they
so
leave
us
to
manage
our
own
affairs
thank
heaven
i
know
what
i
m
talking
about
everybody
knows
that
caution
must
be
exercised
in
a
dead
man
s
house
especially
when
that
house
is
full
of
money
and
when
instead
of
relatives
there
are
persons
who
who
are
there
nobody
knows
how
or
why
in
case
any
valuables
were
missed
who
would
be
accused
of
taking
them
why
the
poor
servants
of
course
ah
they
have
broad
shoulders
their
trunks
would
be
searched
and
even
if
nothing
were
found
they
would
be
sent
to
prison
all
the
same
in
the
meantime
other
people
would
escape
with
the
booty
no
lisette
no
one
will
stir
from
this
room
until
the
arrival
of
the
justice
madame
leon
was
bursting
with
rage
all
right
she
interrupted
i
m
going
to
send
for
the
count
s
particular
friend
general
i
don
t
care
a
fig
for
your
wretch
it
was
mademoiselle
marguerite
who
put
an
end
to
this
indecent
dispute
its
increasing
violence
had
aroused
her
from
her
stupor
casimir
s
impudence
brought
a
flush
to
her
forehead
and
stepping
forward
with
haughty
resolution
she
exclaimed
you
forget
that
one
never
raises
one
s
voice
in
the
chamber
of
her
words
were
so
true
and
her
manner
so
majestic
that
casimir
was
silenced
then
pointing
to
the
door
she
coldly
added
go
for
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
don
t
set
foot
here
again
except
in
his
he
bowed
stammered
an
unintelligible
apology
and
left
the
room
she
always
gets
the
best
of
me
he
growled
as
he
went
downstairs
but
seals
shall
be
put
on
when
he
entered
the
porter
s
lodge
bourigeau
was
just
getting
up
having
slept
all
night
while
his
wife
watched
quick
ordered
casimir
make
haste
and
finish
dressing
and
run
for
the
justice
of
the
peace
we
must
have
him
here
at
once
everything
must
be
done
regularly
and
in
order
the
concierge
was
in
despair
heavens
he
exclaimed
so
the
master
s
dead
what
a
misfortune
you
may
well
say
so
and
this
is
the
second
time
such
a
thing
has
happened
to
me
i
remember
now
what
a
shrewd
fellow
named
chupin
once
said
to
me
if
i
were
a
servant
he
remarked
before
entering
a
man
s
service
i
d
make
him
insure
his
life
for
my
benefit
in
one
of
those
companies
so
that
i
might
step
into
a
handsome
fortune
if
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
but
make
haste
that
s
a
famous
idea
but
scarcely
practicable
growled
the
concierge
i
don
t
know
whether
it
is
or
not
but
at
all
events
i
m
terribly
annoyed
the
count
was
giving
me
enormous
wages
and
i
had
got
him
nicely
into
my
ways
well
after
all
i
shall
only
have
to
begin
again
bourigeau
had
not
yet
attained
to
the
heights
of
such
serene
philosophy
and
as
he
buttoned
his
overcoat
he
groaned
ah
you
re
not
situated
as
i
am
casimir
you
ve
only
yourself
to
look
out
for
i
have
my
furniture
and
if
i
don
t
succeed
in
finding
a
position
where
i
can
have
two
rooms
i
shall
be
obliged
to
sell
part
of
it
what
a
blessed
nuisance
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
he
started
off
on
his
mission
and
casimir
who
dared
not
return
to
the
house
began
walking
slowly
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
lodge
he
had
made
some
thirty
turns
or
so
and
was
beginning
to
feel
impatient
when
he
saw
victor
chupin
approaching
you
are
always
on
hand
at
the
right
moment
remarked
casimir
it
s
all
over
chupin
turned
eagerly
then
our
bargain
holds
he
exclaimed
you
understand
what
i
mean
the
funeral
you
it
isn
t
certain
that
i
shall
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
call
again
in
three
hours
from
all
right
i
ll
be
and
fortunat
asked
casimir
he
received
what
he
called
a
violent
shock
last
evening
but
he
s
better
this
morning
he
instructed
me
to
tell
you
that
he
should
look
for
you
between
twelve
and
one
you
know
i
ll
endeavor
to
be
there
although
it
may
be
difficult
for
me
to
get
away
if
i
go
however
i
ll
show
him
the
letter
that
caused
the
count
s
illness
for
the
count
threw
it
away
after
tearing
it
into
several
pieces
and
i
found
some
of
the
bits
which
escaped
his
notice
as
well
as
mademoiselle
s
it
s
a
strange
letter
upon
my
word
chupin
gazed
at
the
valet
with
a
look
of
mingled
wonder
and
admiration
by
jove
he
exclaimed
how
fortunate
a
man
must
be
to
secure
a
valet
like
you
his
companion
smiled
complacently
but
all
of
a
sudden
he
remarked
make
haste
and
go
i
see
bourigeau
in
the
distance
bringing
the
justice
of
the
vii
the
magistrate
who
was
now
approaching
the
chalusse
mansion
in
the
concierge
s
company
exemplified
in
a
remarkable
manner
all
the
ideas
that
are
awakened
in
one
s
mind
by
the
grand
yet
simple
title
of
justice
of
the
he
was
the
very
person
you
would
like
to
think
of
as
the
family
magistrate
as
the
promoter
of
friendly
feeling
as
the
guardian
of
the
rights
of
the
absent
the
young
and
the
weak
as
the
just
arbiter
in
unfortunate
differences
between
those
who
are
closely
related
a
sage
of
wide
experience
and
boundless
benevolence
a
judge
whose
paternal
justice
dispenses
with
all
pomp
and
display
and
who
is
allowed
by
french
statutes
to
hold
his
court
by
his
own
fireside
providing
the
doors
stand
open
he
was
considerably
over
fifty
tall
and
very
thin
with
bent
shoulders
his
clothes
were
rather
in
cut
but
by
no
means
ridiculous
the
expression
of
his
face
was
gentleness
itself
but
it
would
not
have
done
to
presume
upon
this
gentleness
for
his
glance
was
keen
and
piercing
like
the
glance
of
all
who
are
expert
in
diving
into
consciences
and
discovering
the
secrets
hidden
there
moreover
like
all
men
who
are
accustomed
to
deliberate
in
public
his
features
were
expressionless
he
could
see
and
hear
everything
suspect
and
understand
everything
without
letting
a
muscle
of
his
face
move
and
yet
the
habitues
of
his
and
his
clerks
pretended
that
they
could
always
detect
the
nature
of
his
impressions
a
ring
which
he
wore
upon
one
of
his
fingers
served
as
a
barometer
for
those
who
knew
him
if
a
difficult
case
or
one
that
embarrassed
his
conscience
presented
itself
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
obstinately
upon
this
ring
if
he
were
satisfied
that
everything
was
right
he
looked
up
again
and
began
playing
with
the
ring
slipping
it
up
and
down
between
the
first
and
second
joint
of
his
finger
but
if
he
were
displeased
he
abruptly
turned
the
bezel
inside
in
appearance
he
was
sufficiently
imposing
to
intimidate
even
casimir
the
proud
valet
bowed
low
as
the
magistrate
approached
and
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
and
in
an
obsequious
voice
he
said
it
was
i
who
took
the
liberty
of
sending
for
you
ah
said
the
magistrate
who
already
knew
as
much
about
the
hotel
de
chalusse
and
the
events
of
the
past
twelve
hours
as
casimir
himself
for
on
his
way
to
the
house
he
had
turned
bourigeau
inside
out
like
a
glove
by
means
of
a
dozen
gentle
questions
if
monsieur
wishes
i
will
explain
resumed
casimir
nothing
it
is
quite
unnecessary
usher
us
this
us
astonished
the
valet
but
before
they
reached
the
house
it
was
explained
to
him
he
discovered
a
man
of
flourishing
and
even
jovial
mien
who
was
walking
along
in
the
magistrate
s
shadow
carrying
a
large
black
portfolio
under
his
arm
this
was
evidently
the
clerk
he
seemed
to
be
as
pleased
with
his
employment
as
he
was
with
himself
and
as
he
followed
casimir
he
examined
the
adornments
of
the
mansion
the
mosaics
in
the
vestibule
the
statuary
and
the
frescoed
walls
with
an
appraiser
s
eye
perhaps
he
was
calculating
how
many
years
salary
it
would
require
to
pay
for
the
decorating
of
this
one
staircase
on
the
threshold
of
the
death
room
the
magistrate
paused
there
had
been
some
change
during
casimir
s
absence
the
doctor
had
left
the
bed
had
been
rearranged
and
several
candles
were
burning
on
a
table
covered
with
a
white
cloth
madame
leon
had
gone
to
her
own
room
accompanied
by
two
servants
to
fetch
a
vessel
of
holy
water
and
a
branch
of
withered
palm
she
was
now
engaged
in
repeating
the
prayers
for
the
dead
pausing
from
time
to
time
to
dip
the
palm
branch
in
the
holy
water
and
sprinkle
the
bed
both
windows
had
been
opened
in
spite
of
the
cold
on
the
marble
hearth
stood
a
full
of
embers
from
which
rose
spiral
rings
of
smoke
filling
the
room
with
a
pungent
odor
as
a
servant
poured
some
vinegar
and
sugar
on
to
the
coals
as
the
magistrate
appeared
every
one
rose
up
then
after
bestowing
prolonged
scrutiny
upon
the
room
and
its
occupants
he
respectfully
removed
his
hat
and
walked
in
why
are
so
many
people
here
he
inquired
i
suggested
that
they
should
remain
replied
casimir
because
you
are
suspicious
interrupted
the
magistrate
his
clerk
had
already
drawn
a
pen
and
some
paper
from
his
portfolio
and
was
engaged
in
reading
the
decision
rendered
by
the
magistrate
at
the
request
of
one
bourigeau
and
in
virtue
of
which
seals
were
about
to
be
affixed
to
the
deceased
nobleman
s
personal
effects
since
the
magistrate
had
entered
the
room
his
eyes
had
not
once
wandered
from
mademoiselle
marguerite
who
was
standing
near
the
fireplace
looking
pale
but
composed
at
last
he
approached
her
and
in
a
tone
of
deep
sympathy
are
you
mademoiselle
marguerite
he
asked
she
raised
her
clear
eyes
rendered
more
beautiful
than
ever
by
the
tears
that
trembled
on
her
lashes
and
in
a
faltering
voice
replied
yes
are
you
a
relative
are
you
connected
in
any
way
with
the
count
de
chalusse
have
you
any
right
to
his
property
no
excuse
me
mademoiselle
but
these
questions
are
indispensable
who
intrusted
you
to
the
care
of
de
chalusse
and
by
what
right
was
it
your
father
or
your
mother
i
have
neither
father
nor
mother
monsieur
i
am
alone
in
the
world
utterly
the
magistrate
glanced
keenly
round
the
room
ah
i
understand
said
he
at
last
advantage
has
been
taken
of
your
isolation
to
treat
you
with
disrespect
to
insult
you
every
head
drooped
and
casimir
bitterly
regretted
that
he
had
not
remained
below
in
the
courtyard
mademoiselle
marguerite
looked
at
the
magistrate
in
astonishment
for
she
was
amazed
by
his
penetration
she
was
ignorant
of
his
conversation
with
bourigeau
on
the
road
and
did
not
know
that
through
the
concierge
s
ridiculous
statements
and
accusations
the
magistrate
had
succeeded
in
discovering
at
least
a
portion
of
the
truth
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
asking
for
a
few
moments
conversation
with
you
presently
mademoiselle
he
said
but
first
one
question
i
am
told
that
the
count
de
chalusse
entertained
a
very
lively
affection
for
you
are
you
sure
that
he
has
not
taken
care
to
provide
for
your
future
are
you
sure
that
he
has
not
left
a
will
the
girl
shook
her
head
he
made
one
in
my
favor
some
time
ago
she
replied
i
saw
it
he
gave
it
to
me
to
read
but
it
was
destroyed
a
fortnight
after
my
arrival
here
and
in
compliance
with
my
madame
leon
had
hitherto
been
dumb
with
fear
but
conquering
her
weakness
she
now
decided
to
draw
near
and
take
part
in
the
conversation
how
can
you
say
that
my
dear
young
lady
she
exclaimed
you
know
that
the
count
god
rest
his
soul
was
an
extremely
cautious
man
i
am
certain
that
there
is
a
will
the
magistrate
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
ring
it
would
be
well
to
look
perhaps
before
affixing
the
seals
you
have
a
right
to
require
this
so
if
you
wish
but
she
made
no
reply
oh
yes
insisted
madame
leon
pray
look
but
where
should
we
be
likely
to
find
a
will
certainly
in
this
room
in
this
escritoire
or
in
one
of
the
deceased
count
s
the
magistrate
had
learnt
the
story
of
the
key
from
bourigeau
but
all
the
same
he
asked
where
is
the
key
to
this
escritoire
alas
monsieur
replied
mademoiselle
marguerite
i
broke
it
last
night
when
de
chalusse
was
brought
home
unconscious
i
hoped
to
avert
what
has
nevertheless
happened
besides
i
knew
that
his
escritoire
contained
something
over
two
millions
in
gold
and
two
millions
there
the
occupants
of
the
room
stood
aghast
even
the
clerk
was
so
startled
that
he
let
a
blot
fall
upon
his
paper
two
millions
the
magistrate
was
evidently
reflecting
hum
he
murmured
meditatively
then
as
if
deciding
on
his
course
he
exclaimed
let
a
locksmith
be
sent
a
servant
went
in
search
of
one
and
while
they
were
waiting
for
his
return
the
magistrate
sat
down
beside
his
clerk
and
talked
to
him
in
a
low
voice
at
last
the
locksmith
appeared
with
his
bag
of
tools
hanging
over
his
shoulder
and
set
to
work
at
once
he
found
his
task
a
difficult
one
his
would
not
catch
and
he
was
talking
of
filing
the
bolt
when
by
chance
he
found
the
joint
and
the
door
flew
open
but
the
escritoire
was
empty
there
were
only
a
few
papers
and
a
bottle
about
full
of
a
crimson
liquid
on
the
shelf
had
de
chalusse
rose
and
shook
off
his
winding
sheet
the
consternation
would
not
have
been
greater
the
same
instinctive
fear
thrilled
the
hearts
of
everybody
present
an
enormous
fortune
had
disappeared
the
same
suspicions
would
rest
upon
them
all
and
each
servant
already
saw
himself
arrested
imprisoned
and
dragged
before
a
law
court
however
anger
speedily
followed
bewilderment
and
a
furious
clamor
arose
a
robbery
has
been
committed
cried
the
servants
in
concert
mademoiselle
had
the
key
it
is
wrong
to
suspect
the
innocent
revolting
as
this
exhibition
was
it
did
not
modify
the
magistrate
s
calmness
he
had
witnessed
too
many
such
scenes
in
the
course
of
his
career
and
at
least
a
score
of
times
he
had
been
compelled
to
interpose
between
children
who
had
come
to
blows
over
their
inheritance
before
their
father
s
body
was
even
cold
silence
he
commanded
sternly
and
as
the
tumult
did
not
cease
as
the
servants
continued
to
cry
the
thief
must
be
found
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
discovering
the
culprit
the
magistrate
exclaimed
still
more
imperiously
another
word
and
you
all
leave
the
they
were
silenced
but
there
was
a
mute
eloquence
about
their
looks
and
gestures
which
it
was
impossible
to
misunderstand
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
mademoiselle
marguerite
with
an
almost
ferocious
expression
she
knew
it
only
too
well
but
sublime
in
her
energy
she
stood
with
her
head
proudly
erect
facing
the
storm
and
disdaining
to
answer
these
vile
imputations
however
she
had
a
protector
near
by
the
magistrate
in
person
if
this
treasure
has
been
diverted
from
the
inheritance
said
he
the
thief
will
be
discovered
and
punished
but
i
wish
to
have
one
point
explained
who
said
that
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
the
key
of
the
escritoire
i
did
replied
a
footman
i
was
in
the
yesterday
morning
when
the
count
gave
it
to
for
what
purpose
did
he
give
it
to
her
that
she
might
obtain
this
vial
i
recognized
it
at
once
she
brought
it
down
to
did
she
return
the
key
yes
she
gave
it
to
him
when
she
handed
him
the
vial
and
i
saw
him
put
it
in
his
the
magistrate
pointed
to
the
bottle
which
was
standing
on
the
shelf
then
the
count
himself
must
have
put
the
vial
back
in
its
place
said
he
further
comment
is
unnecessary
for
if
the
money
had
then
been
missing
he
could
not
have
failed
to
discover
the
no
one
had
any
reply
to
make
to
this
quiet
defence
which
was
at
the
same
time
a
complete
vindication
and
besides
continued
the
magistrate
who
told
you
that
this
immense
sum
would
be
found
here
did
you
know
it
which
one
of
you
knew
it
and
as
nobody
still
ventured
any
remark
he
added
in
an
even
more
severe
tone
and
without
seeming
to
notice
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
look
of
gratitude
it
is
by
no
means
a
proof
of
honesty
to
be
so
extremely
suspicious
would
it
not
have
been
easier
to
suppose
that
the
deceased
had
placed
the
money
somewhere
else
and
that
it
will
yet
be
found
the
clerk
had
been
even
less
disturbed
than
the
magistrate
he
also
was
blase
having
witnessed
too
many
of
those
frightful
and
shameless
dramas
which
are
enacted
at
a
dead
man
s
bedside
to
be
surprised
at
anything
if
he
had
deigned
to
glance
at
the
escritoire
it
was
only
because
he
was
curious
to
see
how
small
a
space
would
suffice
to
contain
two
millions
and
then
he
had
begun
to
calculate
how
many
years
he
would
be
obliged
to
remain
a
clerk
before
he
could
succeed
in
amassing
such
a
fabulous
sum
however
hearing
his
superior
express
the
intention
of
continuing
the
search
for
the
will
and
the
missing
treasure
he
abruptly
abandoned
his
calculation
and
exclaimed
then
i
suppose
i
can
commence
my
report
monsieur
yes
replied
the
magistrate
write
as
follows
and
in
a
monotonous
voice
he
began
to
dictate
the
prescribed
formula
an
unnecessary
proceeding
for
the
clerk
was
quite
as
familiar
with
it
as
the
magistrate
himself
on
the
of
october
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
in
compliance
with
the
request
of
the
servants
of
the
deceased
de
durtal
count
de
chalusse
and
in
the
interest
of
his
presumptive
heirs
and
all
others
connected
with
him
and
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
clauses
code
napoleon
and
code
of
procedure
we
justice
of
the
peace
accompanied
by
our
clerk
visited
the
residence
of
the
deceased
aforesaid
in
the
rue
de
courcelles
where
having
entered
a
bedroom
opening
on
to
the
courtyard
and
lighted
by
two
windows
looking
toward
the
south
we
found
the
body
of
the
deceased
aforesaid
lying
on
his
bed
and
covered
with
a
sheet
in
this
room
were
he
paused
in
his
dictation
and
addressing
the
clerk
take
down
the
names
of
all
present
said
he
that
will
require
some
little
time
and
meanwhile
i
will
continue
my
they
had
in
fact
only
examined
the
shelf
of
the
escritoire
and
the
drawers
were
still
to
be
inspected
in
the
first
which
he
opened
the
magistrate
found
ample
proofs
of
the
accuracy
of
the
information
which
had
been
furnished
him
by
mademoiselle
marguerite
the
drawer
contained
a
memorandum
which
established
the
fact
that
the
credit
foncier
had
lent
de
chalusse
the
sum
of
eight
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
which
had
been
remitted
to
him
on
the
saturday
preceding
his
death
beside
this
document
lay
a
second
memorandum
signed
by
a
stockbroker
named
pell
setting
forth
that
the
latter
had
sold
for
the
count
securities
of
various
descriptions
to
the
amount
of
fourteen
hundred
and
thousand
francs
which
sum
had
been
paid
to
the
count
on
the
preceding
tuesday
partly
in
and
partly
in
gold
it
was
thus
evident
that
de
chalusse
had
received
a
grand
total
of
two
million
two
hundred
and
thousand
francs
within
the
past
six
days
in
the
drawer
which
was
next
opened
the
magistrate
only
found
a
number
of
deeds
bonds
leases
and
mortgages
but
they
proved
that
public
rumor
far
from
exaggerating
the
figures
of
the
count
s
fortune
had
diminished
it
and
this
made
it
difficult
to
explain
why
he
had
contracted
a
loan
the
third
and
last
drawer
contained
thousand
francs
in
packages
of
pieces
finally
in
a
small
casket
the
magistrate
found
a
packet
of
letters
yellow
with
age
and
bound
together
with
a
broad
piece
of
blue
velvet
as
well
as
three
or
four
withered
bouquets
and
a
woman
s
glove
which
had
been
worn
by
a
hand
of
marvellous
smallness
these
were
evidently
the
relics
of
some
great
passion
of
many
years
before
and
the
magistrate
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
with
a
sigh
his
own
interest
prevented
him
from
noticing
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
agitation
she
had
almost
fainted
on
perceiving
these
souvenirs
of
the
count
s
past
life
so
suddenly
exhumed
however
the
examination
of
the
escritoire
being
over
and
the
clerk
having
completed
his
task
of
recording
the
names
of
all
the
servants
the
magistrate
said
in
a
loud
voice
i
shall
now
proceed
to
affix
the
seals
but
before
doing
so
i
shall
take
a
portion
of
the
money
found
in
this
desk
and
set
it
apart
for
the
expenses
of
the
household
in
accordance
with
the
law
who
will
take
charge
of
this
money
oh
not
i
exclaimed
madame
leon
i
will
take
charge
of
it
said
casimir
then
here
are
eight
thousand
francs
for
which
you
will
be
held
casimir
being
a
prudent
man
counted
the
money
himself
and
after
doing
so
who
will
attend
to
the
count
s
obsequies
he
inquired
you
and
without
loss
of
proud
of
his
new
importance
the
valet
hastily
left
the
room
his
increased
by
the
thought
that
he
was
to
breakfast
with
isidore
fortunat
and
would
afterward
share
a
fat
commission
with
victor
chupin
however
the
magistrate
had
already
resumed
his
dictation
and
at
this
moment
we
have
affixed
bands
of
white
tape
sealed
at
either
end
with
red
wax
bearing
the
impress
of
our
seal
as
justice
of
the
peace
to
wit
in
the
aforesaid
chamber
of
the
deceased
first
a
band
of
tape
covering
the
keyhole
of
the
lock
of
the
escritoire
which
had
been
previously
opened
by
a
locksmith
summoned
by
us
and
closed
again
by
the
said
locksmith
and
so
the
magistrate
and
his
clerk
went
from
one
piece
of
furniture
to
another
duly
specifying
in
the
report
each
instance
in
which
the
seals
were
affixed
from
the
count
s
bedroom
they
passed
into
his
study
followed
by
mademoiselle
marguerite
madame
leon
and
the
servants
by
noon
every
article
of
furniture
in
which
de
chalusse
would
have
been
likely
to
deposit
his
valuables
or
a
will
had
been
searched
and
nothing
absolutely
nothing
had
been
found
the
magistrate
had
pursued
his
investigation
with
the
feverish
energy
which
the
most
of
men
are
apt
to
display
under
such
circumstances
especially
when
influenced
by
the
conviction
that
the
object
they
are
seeking
is
somewhere
within
their
reach
perhaps
under
their
very
hand
indeed
he
was
persuaded
he
was
sure
he
would
in
fact
have
sworn
that
the
count
de
chalusse
had
taken
all
the
precautions
natural
in
childless
men
who
have
no
near
relatives
to
inherit
their
fortune
or
who
have
placed
their
interest
and
affections
beyond
their
family
circle
and
when
he
was
obliged
to
abandon
his
search
his
gesture
indicated
anger
rather
than
discouragement
for
apparent
evidence
had
not
shaken
his
conviction
in
the
least
so
he
stood
motionless
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
his
ring
as
if
waiting
some
miraculous
inspiration
from
it
for
the
count
s
only
fault
i
am
sure
was
in
being
too
cautious
he
muttered
this
is
frequently
the
case
and
it
would
be
quite
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
this
man
judging
from
what
i
know
of
madame
leon
lifted
her
hands
to
heaven
ah
yes
such
was
indeed
his
nature
she
remarked
approvingly
never
no
never
have
i
seen
such
a
suspicious
and
distrustful
person
as
he
was
not
in
reference
to
money
no
indeed
for
he
left
that
lying
about
everywhere
but
about
his
papers
he
locked
them
up
with
the
greatest
care
as
if
he
feared
that
some
terrible
secret
might
evaporate
from
them
it
was
a
mania
with
him
if
he
had
a
letter
to
write
he
barricaded
his
door
as
if
he
were
about
to
commit
some
horrible
crime
more
than
once
have
i
seen
him
the
words
died
away
on
her
lips
and
she
remained
motionless
and
abashed
like
a
person
who
has
just
escaped
some
great
peril
one
word
more
and
involuntarily
without
even
knowing
it
she
would
have
confessed
her
besetting
sin
which
was
listening
at
and
peering
through
the
keyholes
of
the
doors
that
were
closed
against
her
still
she
deluded
herself
with
the
belief
that
this
slight
indiscretion
of
her
overready
tongue
had
escaped
the
magistrate
s
notice
he
certainly
did
not
seem
to
be
conscious
of
it
for
he
was
giving
his
attention
entirely
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
who
seemed
to
have
regained
the
cold
reserve
and
melancholy
resignation
habitual
to
her
you
see
mademoiselle
he
remarked
that
i
have
done
all
that
is
in
my
power
to
do
we
must
now
leave
the
search
to
chance
and
to
the
person
who
takes
the
inventory
who
knows
what
surprise
may
be
in
store
for
us
in
this
immense
house
of
which
we
have
only
explored
three
rooms
she
shook
her
head
gently
and
replied
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
for
your
kindness
monsieur
and
for
the
great
service
you
rendered
me
in
crushing
that
infamous
accusation
as
regards
the
rest
i
have
never
expected
anything
i
do
not
expect
anything
she
believed
what
she
said
and
her
tone
of
voice
proved
this
so
unmistakably
that
the
magistrate
was
surprised
and
somewhat
disturbed
come
come
my
young
lady
he
said
with
almost
paternal
kindness
of
manner
you
ought
not
to
despond
still
you
must
have
certain
reasons
for
speaking
as
you
do
and
as
i
am
free
for
an
hour
we
are
going
to
have
a
plain
talk
as
if
we
were
father
and
on
hearing
these
words
the
clerk
rose
with
a
cloud
on
his
jovial
face
he
impatiently
jingled
his
bunch
of
keys
for
as
the
seals
are
successively
affixed
each
key
is
confided
to
the
clerk
to
remain
in
his
hands
until
the
seals
are
removed
i
understand
said
the
magistrate
your
stomach
which
is
more
exacting
in
its
demands
than
mine
is
not
satisfied
with
a
cup
of
chocolate
till
so
go
and
get
your
lunch
on
your
return
you
will
find
me
here
you
may
now
conclude
the
report
and
request
these
parties
to
sign
urged
on
by
hunger
the
clerk
hastily
mumbled
over
the
remainder
of
the
formula
called
all
the
names
that
he
had
inserted
in
the
report
and
each
of
the
servants
advanced
in
turn
signed
his
or
her
name
or
made
a
cross
and
then
retired
madame
leon
read
in
the
judge
s
face
that
she
also
was
expected
to
withdraw
and
she
was
reluctantly
leaving
the
room
when
mademoiselle
marguerite
detained
her
to
ask
are
you
quite
sure
that
nothing
has
come
for
me
nothing
mademoiselle
i
went
in
person
to
inquire
of
the
did
you
post
my
letter
last
night
oh
my
dear
young
lady
can
you
doubt
it
the
young
girl
stifled
a
sigh
and
then
with
a
gesture
of
dismissal
she
remarked
m
de
fondege
must
be
sent
the
general
i
will
send
for
him
at
once
replied
the
housekeeper
and
thereupon
she
left
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
her
with
a
vicious
slam
viii
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
mademoiselle
marguerite
were
at
last
alone
in
de
chalusse
s
study
this
room
which
the
count
had
preferred
above
all
others
was
a
spacious
magnificent
but
rather
gloomy
apartment
with
lofty
walls
and
dark
richly
carved
furniture
its
present
aspect
was
more
than
ever
solemn
and
lugubrious
for
it
gave
one
a
chill
to
see
the
bands
of
white
tape
affixed
to
the
locks
of
the
cabinets
and
bookcases
when
the
magistrate
had
installed
himself
in
the
count
s
and
the
girl
had
taken
a
seat
near
him
they
remained
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
the
magistrate
was
asking
himself
how
he
should
begin
having
fathomed
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
extreme
sensitiveness
and
reserve
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
offended
or
alarmed
her
she
would
refuse
him
her
confidence
in
which
case
he
would
be
powerless
to
serve
her
as
he
wished
to
do
he
had
in
fact
an
almost
passionate
desire
to
be
of
service
to
her
feeling
himself
drawn
toward
her
by
an
inexplicable
feeling
of
sympathy
in
which
esteem
respect
and
admiration
alike
were
blended
though
he
had
only
known
her
for
a
few
hours
still
he
must
make
a
beginning
mademoiselle
he
said
at
last
i
abstained
from
questioning
you
before
the
servants
and
if
i
take
the
liberty
of
doing
so
now
it
is
not
believe
me
out
of
any
idle
curiosity
moreover
you
are
not
compelled
to
answer
me
but
you
are
young
and
i
am
an
old
man
and
it
is
my
duty
even
if
my
heart
did
not
urge
me
to
do
so
to
offer
you
the
aid
of
my
experience
speak
monsieur
interrupted
marguerite
i
will
answer
your
questions
frankly
or
else
not
answer
them
at
to
resume
then
said
he
i
am
told
that
de
chalusse
has
no
relatives
near
or
remote
is
this
the
truth
so
far
as
i
know
yes
monsieur
still
i
have
heard
it
said
that
a
sister
of
his
mademoiselle
hermine
de
chalusse
abandoned
her
home
or
thirty
years
ago
when
she
was
about
my
age
and
that
she
has
never
received
her
share
of
the
enormous
fortune
left
by
her
and
has
this
sister
never
given
any
sign
of
life
never
still
monsieur
i
have
promised
you
to
be
perfectly
frank
that
letter
which
the
count
de
chalusse
received
yesterday
that
letter
which
i
regard
as
the
cause
of
his
death
well
i
have
a
presentiment
that
it
came
from
his
sister
it
could
only
have
been
written
by
her
or
by
that
other
person
whose
letters
and
souvenirs
you
found
in
the
and
this
other
person
who
can
she
be
as
the
young
girl
made
no
reply
the
magistrate
did
not
insist
but
continued
and
you
my
child
who
are
you
she
made
a
gesture
of
sorrowful
resignation
and
then
in
a
voice
faltering
with
emotion
she
answered
i
do
not
know
monsieur
perhaps
i
am
the
count
s
daughter
i
should
be
telling
an
untruth
if
i
said
that
was
not
my
belief
yes
i
believe
it
but
i
have
never
been
certain
of
it
sometimes
i
have
believed
sometimes
i
have
doubted
it
on
certain
days
i
have
said
to
myself
yes
it
must
be
so
and
i
have
longed
to
throw
my
arms
around
his
neck
but
at
other
times
i
have
exclaimed
no
it
isn
t
possible
and
i
have
almost
hated
him
besides
he
never
said
a
word
on
the
subject
never
a
decisive
word
at
least
when
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
six
years
ago
i
judged
by
the
manner
in
which
he
forbade
me
to
call
him
father
that
he
would
never
answer
any
question
i
might
ask
on
the
if
there
was
a
man
in
the
world
inaccessible
to
idle
curiosity
it
was
certainly
this
magistrate
whose
profession
condemned
him
to
listen
every
day
to
family
grievances
neighborly
quarrels
complaints
accusations
and
slander
and
yet
as
he
listened
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
he
experienced
that
strange
disquietude
which
seizes
hold
of
a
person
when
a
puzzling
problem
is
presented
allow
me
to
believe
that
many
decisive
proofs
may
have
escaped
your
notice
on
account
of
your
inexperience
he
said
but
interrupting
him
with
a
gesture
she
sadly
remarked
you
are
mistaken
i
am
not
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
what
he
considered
her
poor
child
said
he
how
old
are
you
eighteen
she
shook
her
head
yes
by
my
certificate
of
birth
i
am
only
eighteen
but
by
the
sufferings
i
have
endured
i
am
perhaps
older
than
you
are
monsieur
despite
your
white
hair
those
who
have
lived
such
a
life
as
i
have
are
never
young
they
are
old
in
suffering
even
in
their
childhood
and
if
by
experience
you
mean
lack
of
confidence
a
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
distrust
of
everything
and
everybody
mine
young
girl
though
i
be
will
no
doubt
equal
she
paused
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
but
why
should
i
wait
for
you
to
question
me
it
is
neither
sincere
nor
dignified
on
my
part
to
do
so
the
person
who
claims
counsel
owes
absolute
frankness
to
his
adviser
i
will
speak
to
you
as
if
i
were
communing
with
my
own
soul
i
will
tell
you
what
no
person
has
ever
known
no
one
not
even
pascal
and
believe
me
my
past
life
was
full
of
bitter
misery
although
you
find
me
here
in
this
splendid
house
but
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
and
if
i
have
cause
to
blush
it
is
for
others
not
for
perhaps
she
was
impelled
by
an
irresistible
desire
to
relieve
her
overburdened
heart
after
long
years
of
perhaps
she
no
longer
felt
sure
of
herself
and
desired
some
other
advice
than
the
dictates
of
her
conscience
in
presence
of
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
her
at
all
events
too
much
engrossed
in
her
own
thoughts
to
heed
the
magistrate
s
surprise
or
hear
the
words
he
faltered
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
with
her
hands
pressed
tightly
on
her
throbbing
brow
she
began
to
tell
the
story
of
her
life
my
first
recollections
she
said
are
of
a
narrow
cheerless
courtyard
surrounded
by
grim
and
massive
walls
so
high
that
i
could
scarcely
see
the
top
of
them
at
noontime
in
summer
the
sun
visited
one
little
corner
where
there
was
a
stone
bench
but
in
winter
it
never
showed
itself
at
all
there
were
five
or
six
small
scrubby
trees
with
trunks
and
feeble
branches
which
put
forth
a
few
yellow
leaves
at
springtime
we
were
some
thirty
children
who
assembled
in
this
courtyard
children
from
five
to
eight
years
old
all
clad
alike
in
brown
dresses
with
a
little
blue
handkerchief
tied
about
our
shoulders
we
all
wore
blue
caps
on
and
white
ones
on
sundays
with
woollen
stockings
thick
shoes
and
a
black
ribbon
with
a
large
metal
cross
dangling
from
our
necks
among
us
moved
the
good
sisters
silent
and
sad
with
their
hands
crossed
in
their
large
sleeves
their
faces
as
white
as
their
snowy
caps
and
their
long
strings
of
beads
set
off
with
numerous
copper
medals
clanking
when
they
walked
like
prisoners
chains
as
a
rule
each
face
wore
the
same
expression
of
resignation
unvarying
gentleness
and
inexhaustible
patience
but
there
were
some
who
wore
it
only
as
one
wears
a
mask
some
whose
eyes
gleamed
at
times
with
passion
and
who
vented
their
cold
bitter
anger
upon
us
defenceless
children
however
there
was
one
sister
still
young
and
very
fair
whose
manner
was
so
gentle
and
so
sad
that
even
i
with
my
mere
infantile
intelligence
felt
that
she
must
have
some
terrible
sorrow
during
she
often
took
me
on
her
knee
and
embraced
me
with
convulsive
tenderness
murmuring
dear
little
one
darling
little
one
sometimes
her
endearments
were
irksome
to
me
but
i
never
allowed
her
to
see
it
for
fear
of
making
her
still
more
sad
and
in
my
heart
i
was
content
and
proud
to
suffer
for
and
with
her
poor
sister
i
owe
her
the
only
happy
hours
of
my
infancy
she
was
called
sister
calliste
i
do
not
know
what
has
become
of
her
but
often
when
my
heart
fails
me
i
think
of
her
and
even
now
i
can
not
mention
her
name
without
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
indeed
weeping
big
tears
which
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
were
coursing
down
her
cheeks
it
cost
her
a
great
effort
to
continue
you
have
already
understood
monsieur
what
i
myself
did
not
know
for
several
years
i
was
in
a
foundling
asylum
and
i
was
a
foundling
myself
i
can
not
say
that
we
lacked
anything
and
i
should
be
ungrateful
if
i
did
not
say
and
feel
that
these
good
sisters
were
charity
personified
but
alas
their
hearts
had
only
a
certain
amount
of
tenderness
to
distribute
between
thirty
poor
little
girls
and
so
each
child
s
portion
was
small
the
caresses
were
the
same
for
all
and
i
longed
to
be
loved
differently
to
have
kind
words
and
caresses
for
myself
alone
we
slept
in
little
white
beds
with
snowy
curtains
in
a
clean
dormitory
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
statue
of
the
virgin
who
seemed
to
smile
on
us
all
alike
in
winter
we
had
a
fire
our
clothes
were
warm
and
neat
our
food
was
excellent
we
were
taught
to
read
and
write
to
sew
and
embroider
there
was
a
recreation
hour
between
all
the
exercises
those
who
were
studious
and
good
were
rewarded
and
twice
a
week
we
were
taken
into
the
country
for
a
long
walk
it
was
during
one
of
these
excursions
that
i
learned
from
the
talk
of
the
what
we
were
and
what
we
were
called
sometimes
in
the
afternoon
we
were
visited
by
ladies
who
were
accompanied
by
their
own
children
radiant
with
health
and
happiness
the
good
sisters
told
us
that
these
were
pious
ladies
or
charitable
ladies
whom
we
must
love
and
respect
and
whom
we
must
never
forget
to
mention
in
our
prayers
they
always
brought
us
toys
and
cakes
sometimes
the
establishment
was
visited
by
priests
and
grave
old
gentlemen
whose
sternness
of
manner
alarmed
us
they
peered
into
every
nook
and
corner
asked
questions
about
everything
assured
themselves
that
everything
was
in
its
place
and
some
of
them
even
tasted
our
soup
they
were
always
satisfied
and
the
lady
superior
led
them
through
the
building
and
bowed
to
them
exclaiming
we
love
them
so
much
the
poor
little
dears
and
the
gentlemen
replied
yes
yes
my
dear
sister
they
are
very
and
the
gentlemen
were
right
poor
laborers
children
are
often
obliged
to
endure
privations
which
we
knew
nothing
of
they
are
often
obliged
to
make
their
supper
off
a
piece
of
dry
bread
but
then
the
crust
is
given
them
by
their
mother
with
a
the
magistrate
who
was
extremely
ill
at
ease
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
finding
a
syllable
to
offer
in
reply
indeed
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
not
given
him
an
opportunity
to
speak
so
rapidly
had
this
flood
of
recollections
poured
from
her
lips
when
she
spoke
the
word
mother
the
magistrate
fancied
she
would
show
some
sign
of
emotion
but
he
was
mistaken
on
the
contrary
her
voice
became
harsher
and
a
flash
of
anger
as
it
were
darted
from
her
eyes
i
suffered
exceedingly
in
that
asylum
she
resumed
sister
calliste
left
the
establishment
and
all
the
surroundings
chilled
and
repelled
me
my
only
few
hours
of
happiness
were
on
sundays
when
we
attended
church
as
the
great
organ
pealed
and
as
i
watched
the
priests
officiating
at
the
altar
in
their
gorgeous
vestments
i
forgot
my
own
sorrows
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
ascending
on
the
clouds
of
incense
to
the
celestial
sphere
which
the
sisters
so
often
talked
to
us
about
and
where
they
said
each
little
girl
would
find
her
mademoiselle
marguerite
hesitated
for
an
instant
as
if
she
were
somewhat
unwilling
to
give
utterance
to
her
thoughts
but
at
last
forcing
herself
to
continue
she
said
yes
i
suffered
exceedingly
in
that
foundling
asylum
almost
all
my
little
companions
were
spiteful
unattractive
in
person
sallow
thin
and
afflicted
with
all
kinds
of
diseases
as
if
they
were
not
unfortunate
enough
in
being
abandoned
by
their
parents
and
to
my
shame
monsieur
i
must
confess
it
these
unfortunate
little
beings
inspired
me
with
unconquerable
repugnance
with
disgust
bordering
on
aversion
i
would
rather
have
pressed
my
lips
to
a
iron
than
to
the
forehead
of
one
of
these
children
i
did
not
reason
on
the
subject
alas
i
was
only
eight
or
nine
years
old
but
i
felt
this
antipathy
in
every
fibre
of
my
being
the
others
knew
it
too
and
in
revenge
they
ironically
styled
me
the
lady
and
left
me
severely
alone
but
sometimes
during
playtime
when
the
good
sisters
backs
were
turned
the
children
attacked
me
beat
me
and
scratched
my
face
and
tore
my
clothes
i
endured
these
onslaughts
uncomplainingly
for
i
was
conscious
that
i
deserved
them
but
how
many
reprimands
my
torn
clothes
cost
me
how
many
times
i
received
only
a
dry
crust
for
my
supper
after
being
soundly
scolded
and
called
little
but
as
i
was
quiet
studious
and
industrious
a
quicker
learner
than
the
majority
of
my
companions
the
sisters
were
fond
of
me
they
said
that
i
was
a
promising
girl
and
that
they
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
me
a
nice
home
with
some
of
the
rich
and
pious
ladies
who
have
a
share
in
managing
institutions
of
this
kind
the
only
fault
the
sisters
found
with
me
was
that
i
was
sullen
but
such
was
not
really
the
case
i
was
only
sad
and
resigned
everything
around
me
so
depressed
and
saddened
me
that
i
withdrew
into
myself
and
buried
all
my
thoughts
and
aspirations
deep
in
my
heart
if
i
had
naturally
been
a
bad
child
i
scarcely
know
what
would
have
been
the
result
of
this
i
have
often
asked
myself
the
question
in
all
sincerity
but
i
have
been
unable
to
reply
for
one
can
not
be
an
impartial
judge
respecting
one
s
self
however
this
much
is
certain
although
childhood
generally
leaves
a
train
of
pleasant
recollections
in
a
young
girl
s
life
mine
was
only
fraught
with
torture
and
misery
desperate
struggles
and
humiliation
i
was
unwilling
to
be
confirmed
because
i
did
not
wish
to
wear
a
certain
dress
which
a
benevolent
lady
had
presented
for
the
use
of
the
asylum
and
which
had
belonged
to
a
little
girl
of
my
own
age
who
had
died
of
consumption
the
thought
of
arraying
myself
in
this
dress
to
approach
the
holy
table
frightened
and
revolted
me
as
much
as
if
i
had
been
sentenced
to
drape
myself
in
a
and
yet
it
was
the
prettiest
dress
of
all
white
muslin
beautifully
embroidered
it
had
been
ardently
coveted
by
the
other
children
and
had
been
given
to
me
as
a
sort
of
reward
of
merit
and
i
dared
not
explain
the
cause
of
my
unconquerable
repugnance
who
would
have
understood
me
i
should
only
have
been
accused
of
undue
sensitiveness
and
pride
absurd
in
one
of
my
humble
position
i
was
then
only
twelve
years
old
but
no
one
knew
the
struggle
in
my
mind
save
the
old
priest
my
confessor
i
could
confess
everything
to
him
he
understood
me
and
did
not
reproach
me
still
he
answered
you
must
wear
this
dress
my
child
for
your
pride
must
be
broken
go
i
shall
impose
no
other
penance
on
i
obeyed
him
full
of
superstitious
terror
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
a
frightful
omen
which
would
bring
me
misfortune
my
whole
life
through
and
i
was
confirmed
in
the
dead
girl
s
embroidered
during
the
years
that
he
had
held
the
position
of
justice
of
the
peace
the
magistrate
had
listened
to
many
confessions
wrung
from
wretched
souls
by
stern
necessity
or
sorrow
but
never
had
his
heart
been
moved
as
it
now
was
by
this
narrative
told
with
such
uncomplaining
anguish
and
in
a
tone
of
such
sincerity
however
she
resumed
her
story
the
confirmation
over
our
life
became
as
gloomily
monotonous
as
before
we
read
the
same
pious
books
and
did
the
same
work
at
the
same
hours
as
formerly
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
stifling
in
this
atmosphere
i
gasped
for
breath
and
thought
that
anything
would
be
preferable
to
this
semblance
of
existence
which
was
not
real
life
i
was
thinking
of
applying
for
the
good
situation
which
had
so
often
been
mentioned
to
me
when
one
morning
i
was
summoned
into
the
steward
s
office
a
mysterious
and
frightful
place
to
us
children
he
himself
was
a
stout
dirty
man
wearing
large
blue
spectacles
and
a
black
silk
skullcap
and
from
morning
until
night
summer
and
winter
he
sat
writing
at
a
desk
behind
a
little
grating
hung
with
green
curtains
round
the
room
were
ranged
the
registers
in
which
our
names
were
recorded
and
our
appearances
described
together
with
the
boxes
containing
the
articles
found
upon
us
which
were
carefully
preserved
to
assist
in
identifying
us
should
occasion
arise
i
entered
this
office
with
a
throbbing
heart
in
addition
to
the
stout
gentleman
and
the
lady
superior
i
found
there
a
thin
wiry
man
with
cunning
eyes
and
a
portly
woman
with
a
coarse
but
rather
face
the
superior
at
once
informed
me
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
and
madame
greloux
bookbinders
who
had
come
to
the
asylum
in
search
of
two
apprentices
and
she
asked
me
if
i
should
like
to
be
one
of
them
ah
monsieur
it
seemed
to
me
that
heaven
had
opened
before
me
and
i
boldly
replied
the
gentleman
in
the
black
skullcap
immediately
emerged
from
his
place
behind
the
grating
to
explain
my
obligations
and
duties
to
me
at
length
especially
insisting
upon
the
point
that
i
ought
to
be
grateful
i
a
miserable
foundling
reared
by
public
charity
for
the
generosity
which
this
good
gentleman
and
lady
showed
in
offering
to
take
charge
of
me
and
employ
me
in
their
workshop
i
must
confess
that
i
could
not
clearly
realize
in
what
this
great
generosity
which
he
so
highly
praised
consisted
nor
did
i
perceive
any
reason
why
i
should
be
particularly
grateful
still
to
all
the
conditions
imposed
upon
me
i
answered
yes
yes
yes
so
heartily
that
madame
greloux
seemed
greatly
pleased
it
is
evident
that
the
child
will
be
glad
to
get
away
she
said
to
herself
then
the
superior
began
to
enumerate
the
obligations
my
employers
would
incur
repeating
again
and
again
that
i
was
one
of
the
very
best
girls
in
the
asylum
pious
obedient
and
industrious
reading
and
writing
to
perfection
and
knowing
how
to
sew
and
embroider
as
only
those
who
are
taught
in
such
institutions
can
she
made
madame
greloux
promise
to
watch
over
me
as
she
would
have
watched
over
her
own
daughter
never
to
leave
me
alone
to
take
me
to
church
and
allow
me
an
occasional
sunday
afternoon
so
that
i
might
pay
a
visit
to
the
asylum
the
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
and
the
skullcap
then
reminded
the
bookbinder
of
the
duties
of
an
employer
toward
his
apprentices
and
turning
to
a
bookcase
behind
him
he
even
took
down
a
large
volume
from
which
he
read
extract
after
extract
which
i
listened
to
without
understanding
a
word
though
i
was
quite
sure
that
the
book
was
written
in
french
at
last
when
the
man
and
his
wife
had
said
amen
to
everything
the
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
drew
up
a
document
which
we
all
signed
in
turn
i
belonged
to
a
she
paused
here
her
childhood
ended
but
almost
immediately
she
resumed
my
recollections
of
these
people
are
not
altogether
unpleasant
they
were
harassed
and
wearied
by
their
efforts
to
support
their
son
in
a
style
of
living
far
above
their
position
but
despite
their
sacrifices
their
son
had
no
affection
for
them
and
on
this
account
i
pitied
them
however
not
only
was
the
husband
gloomy
and
but
his
wife
also
was
subject
to
fits
of
passion
so
that
the
apprentices
often
had
a
hard
time
of
it
still
between
madame
greloux
s
tempests
of
wrath
there
were
occasional
gleams
of
sunshine
after
beating
us
for
nothing
she
would
exclaim
with
quite
as
little
reason
come
and
kiss
me
and
don
t
pout
any
more
here
are
four
sous
go
and
buy
yourself
some
the
justice
started
in
his
was
it
indeed
mademoiselle
marguerite
who
was
speaking
the
proud
young
girl
with
a
queenlike
bearing
whose
voice
rang
out
like
crystal
was
it
she
indeed
who
imitated
the
harsh
coarse
dialect
of
the
lower
classes
with
such
accuracy
of
intonation
ah
at
that
moment
as
her
past
life
rose
so
vividly
before
her
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
still
in
the
years
gone
by
and
she
fancied
she
could
still
hear
the
voice
of
the
bookbinder
s
wife
she
did
not
even
notice
the
magistrate
s
astonishment
i
had
left
the
asylum
she
continued
and
that
was
everything
to
me
i
felt
that
a
new
and
different
life
was
beginning
and
that
was
enough
i
flattered
myself
that
i
might
win
a
more
earnest
and
sincere
affection
among
these
honest
industrious
toilers
than
i
had
found
in
the
asylum
and
to
win
it
and
deserve
it
i
neglected
nothing
that
could
suggest
or
strength
allow
my
patrons
no
doubt
fathomed
my
desire
and
naturally
enough
perhaps
unconsciously
they
took
advantage
of
my
wish
to
please
i
can
scarcely
blame
them
i
had
entered
their
home
under
certain
conditions
in
view
of
learning
a
profession
they
gradually
made
me
their
servant
it
was
praiseworthy
economy
on
their
part
what
i
had
at
first
done
of
my
own
freewill
and
from
a
wish
to
please
at
last
became
my
daily
task
which
i
was
rigidly
required
to
fulfil
compelled
to
rise
long
before
any
one
else
in
the
house
i
was
expected
to
have
everything
in
order
by
the
time
the
others
made
their
appearance
with
their
eyes
still
heavy
with
sleep
it
is
true
that
my
benefactors
rewarded
me
after
their
fashion
on
sundays
they
took
me
with
them
on
their
excursions
into
the
country
so
as
to
give
me
a
rest
they
said
after
the
week
s
work
and
i
followed
them
along
the
dusty
highways
in
the
hot
sunshine
panting
perspiring
and
tottering
under
the
weight
of
a
heavy
basket
of
provisions
which
were
eaten
on
the
grass
or
in
the
woods
and
the
remnants
of
which
fell
to
me
madame
greloux
s
brother
generally
accompanied
us
and
his
name
would
have
lingered
in
my
memory
even
if
it
had
not
been
a
peculiar
one
he
was
called
vantrasson
he
was
a
tall
robust
man
with
eyes
that
made
me
tremble
whenever
he
fixed
them
upon
me
he
was
a
soldier
intensely
proud
of
his
uniform
a
great
talker
and
enchanted
with
himself
he
evidently
thought
himself
irresistible
it
was
from
that
man
s
mouth
that
i
heard
the
first
coarse
word
at
which
my
unsophisticated
heart
took
offence
it
was
not
to
be
the
last
one
he
finally
told
me
that
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
me
and
i
was
obliged
to
complain
to
madame
greloux
of
her
brother
s
persecutions
but
she
only
laughed
at
me
and
said
nonsense
he
s
merely
talking
to
hear
himself
yes
that
was
her
answer
and
yet
she
was
an
honest
woman
a
devoted
wife
and
a
fond
mother
ah
if
she
had
had
a
daughter
but
with
a
poor
apprentice
who
has
neither
father
nor
mother
one
need
not
be
she
had
made
a
great
many
promises
to
the
lady
superior
but
she
fancied
that
the
utterance
of
a
few
commonplace
words
of
warning
relieved
her
of
all
further
obligations
and
so
much
the
worse
for
those
who
allow
themselves
to
be
fooled
she
always
added
in
conclusion
fortunately
my
pride
which
i
had
so
often
been
reproached
with
shielded
me
my
condition
might
be
humble
but
my
spirit
was
lofty
it
was
a
blessing
from
god
this
pride
of
mine
for
it
saved
me
from
temptation
while
so
many
fell
around
me
i
slept
with
the
other
apprentices
in
the
attic
where
we
were
entirely
beyond
the
control
of
those
who
should
have
been
our
guardians
that
is
to
say
when
the
day
s
toil
was
over
and
the
closed
we
were
free
abandoned
to
our
own
instincts
and
the
most
pernicious
influences
and
neither
evil
advice
nor
bad
example
was
wanting
the
women
employed
in
the
bindery
in
nowise
restrained
themselves
in
our
presence
and
we
heard
them
tell
marvellous
stories
that
dazzled
many
a
poor
girl
they
did
not
talk
as
they
did
from
any
evil
design
or
out
of
a
spirit
of
calculation
but
from
pure
thoughtlessness
and
because
they
were
quite
devoid
of
moral
sense
and
they
never
tired
of
telling
us
of
the
pleasures
of
life
of
fine
dinners
at
restaurants
gay
excursions
to
and
masked
balls
at
montparnasse
or
the
elysee
montmartre
ah
experience
is
quickly
gained
in
these
sometimes
those
who
went
off
at
night
with
ragged
dresses
and
shoes
returned
the
next
morning
in
superb
toilettes
to
say
that
they
resigned
their
situations
as
they
were
not
made
for
work
and
intended
to
live
like
ladies
they
departed
radiant
but
often
before
a
month
was
over
they
came
back
emaciated
and
despairing
and
humbly
begged
for
a
little
she
paused
so
crushed
by
the
weight
of
these
sad
memories
as
to
lose
consciousness
of
the
present
and
the
judge
also
remained
silent
not
daring
to
question
her
and
besides
what
good
would
it
do
what
could
she
tell
him
about
these
poor
little
apprentices
that
he
did
not
know
already
if
he
was
surprised
at
anything
it
was
that
this
beautiful
young
girl
who
had
been
left
alone
and
defenceless
had
possessed
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
escape
the
horrible
dangers
that
threatened
her
however
it
was
not
long
before
mademoiselle
marguerite
shook
off
the
torpor
which
had
stolen
over
her
i
ought
not
to
boast
of
my
strength
sir
she
resumed
besides
my
pride
i
had
a
hope
to
sustain
me
a
hope
which
i
clung
to
with
the
tenacity
of
despair
i
wished
to
become
expert
at
my
profession
for
i
had
learned
that
skilled
workers
were
always
in
demand
and
could
always
command
good
wages
so
when
my
household
duties
were
over
i
still
found
time
to
learn
the
business
and
made
such
rapid
progress
that
i
astonished
even
my
employer
i
knew
that
i
should
soon
be
able
to
make
five
or
six
francs
a
day
and
this
prospect
was
pleasant
enough
to
make
me
forget
the
present
intolerable
as
it
sometimes
was
during
the
last
winter
that
i
spent
with
my
employers
their
orders
were
so
numerous
and
pressing
that
they
worked
on
sundays
as
well
as
on
week
days
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
obtained
an
hour
twice
a
month
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
good
sisters
who
had
cared
for
me
in
my
childhood
i
had
never
failed
in
this
duty
and
indeed
it
had
now
become
my
only
pleasure
my
employer
s
conscience
compelled
him
to
pay
me
a
trifle
occasionally
for
the
additional
toil
he
imposed
upon
me
and
the
few
francs
i
thus
received
i
carried
to
the
poor
children
at
the
asylum
after
living
all
my
life
on
public
charity
i
was
able
to
give
in
my
turn
and
this
thought
gratified
my
pride
and
increased
my
importance
in
my
own
eyes
i
was
nearly
fifteen
and
my
term
of
apprenticeship
had
almost
expired
when
one
bright
day
in
march
i
saw
one
of
the
lay
sisters
of
the
asylum
enter
the
she
was
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
her
face
was
crimson
and
she
was
so
breathless
from
her
hurried
ascent
of
the
stairs
that
she
gasped
rather
than
said
to
me
quick
come
follow
me
some
one
is
waiting
for
you
who
where
make
haste
ah
my
dear
child
if
you
only
knew
i
hesitated
but
madame
greloux
pushed
me
toward
the
door
exclaiming
be
off
you
little
stupid
i
followed
the
sister
without
thinking
of
changing
my
dress
without
even
removing
the
kitchen
apron
i
wore
downstairs
at
the
front
door
stood
the
most
magnificent
carriage
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
its
rich
silk
cushions
were
so
beautiful
that
i
scarcely
dared
to
enter
it
and
i
was
all
the
more
intimidated
by
a
footman
in
gorgeous
livery
who
respectfully
opened
the
door
at
our
approach
you
must
get
into
the
carriage
said
the
sister
it
was
sent
for
i
obeyed
her
and
before
i
had
recovered
from
my
astonishment
we
had
reached
the
asylum
and
i
was
ushered
into
the
office
where
the
contract
which
bound
me
as
an
apprentice
had
been
signed
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
superior
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
toward
a
gentleman
who
was
sitting
near
the
window
marguerite
said
she
salute
monsieur
le
comte
de
ix
for
some
little
time
there
had
been
a
noise
of
footsteps
and
a
subdued
murmur
of
voices
in
the
vestibule
annoyed
by
this
interruption
although
he
perfectly
understood
its
cause
the
magistrate
rose
and
hastily
opened
the
door
he
was
not
mistaken
his
clerk
had
returned
from
lunch
and
the
time
of
waiting
seemed
extremely
long
to
him
ah
it
s
you
said
the
magistrate
very
well
begin
your
inventory
it
won
t
be
long
before
i
join
and
closing
the
door
he
resumed
his
seat
again
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
so
absorbed
in
her
narrative
that
she
scarcely
noticed
this
incident
and
he
had
not
seated
himself
before
she
resumed
in
all
my
life
i
had
never
seen
such
an
imposing
looking
person
as
the
count
de
chalusse
his
manner
attire
and
features
could
not
fail
to
inspire
a
child
like
me
with
fear
and
respect
i
was
so
awed
that
i
had
scarcely
enough
presence
of
mind
to
bow
to
him
he
glanced
at
me
coldly
and
exclaimed
ah
is
this
the
young
girl
you
were
speaking
of
the
count
s
tone
betrayed
such
disagreeable
surprise
that
the
superior
was
dismayed
she
looked
at
me
and
seemed
indignant
at
my
more
than
modest
attire
it
s
a
shame
to
allow
a
child
to
leave
home
dressed
in
this
fashion
she
angrily
exclaimed
and
she
almost
tore
my
huge
apron
off
me
and
then
with
her
own
hands
began
to
arrange
my
hair
as
if
to
display
me
to
better
advantage
ah
these
employers
she
exclaimed
the
best
of
them
are
bad
how
they
do
deceive
you
it
s
impossible
to
place
any
confidence
in
their
promises
still
one
can
t
always
be
at
their
but
the
superior
s
efforts
were
wasted
for
de
chalusse
had
turned
away
and
had
begun
talking
with
some
gentlemen
near
by
for
the
office
was
full
that
morning
five
or
six
gentlemen
whom
i
recognized
as
the
directors
of
the
asylum
were
standing
round
the
steward
in
the
black
skullcap
they
were
evidently
talking
about
me
i
was
certain
of
this
by
the
glances
they
gave
me
glances
which
however
were
full
of
kindness
the
superior
joined
the
group
and
began
speaking
with
unusual
vivacity
while
standing
in
the
recess
of
a
window
i
listened
with
all
my
might
but
i
must
have
overestimated
my
intelligence
for
i
could
gain
no
meaning
whatever
from
the
phrases
which
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
though
the
words
adoption
emancipation
dowry
compensation
reimbursement
for
sums
expended
recurred
again
and
again
i
was
only
certain
of
one
point
the
count
de
chalusse
wished
something
and
these
gentlemen
were
specifying
other
things
in
exchange
to
each
of
their
demands
he
answered
yes
yes
it
s
granted
that
s
but
at
last
he
began
to
grow
impatient
and
in
a
voice
which
impressed
one
with
the
idea
that
he
was
accustomed
to
command
he
exclaimed
i
will
do
whatever
you
wish
do
you
desire
anything
more
the
gentlemen
at
once
became
silent
and
the
superior
hastily
declared
that
de
chalusse
was
a
thousand
times
too
good
but
that
one
could
expect
no
less
of
him
the
last
representative
of
one
of
the
greatest
and
oldest
families
of
france
i
can
not
describe
the
surprise
and
indignation
that
were
raging
in
my
soul
i
divined
i
felt
that
it
was
my
fate
my
future
my
life
that
were
being
decided
and
i
was
not
even
consulted
on
the
matter
they
were
disposing
of
me
as
if
they
were
sure
in
advance
of
my
consent
my
pride
revolted
at
the
thought
but
i
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
in
protest
crimson
with
shame
confused
and
furious
i
was
wondering
how
i
could
interfere
when
suddenly
the
consultation
ceased
and
the
gentlemen
at
once
surrounded
me
one
of
them
a
little
old
man
with
a
vapid
smile
and
twinkling
eyes
tapped
me
on
the
cheek
and
said
so
she
is
as
good
as
she
is
pretty
i
could
have
struck
him
but
all
the
others
laughed
approvingly
with
the
exception
of
de
chalusse
whose
manner
became
more
and
more
frigid
and
whose
lips
wore
a
constrained
smile
as
if
he
had
resolved
to
keep
his
temper
despite
all
provocation
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
suffering
terribly
and
i
afterward
learned
that
i
had
not
been
mistaken
far
from
imitating
the
old
gentleman
s
manner
he
bowed
to
me
very
gravely
with
an
air
of
deference
that
quite
abashed
me
and
went
away
after
saying
that
he
would
return
the
next
day
to
conclude
the
arrangements
i
was
at
last
left
alone
with
the
superior
whom
i
longed
to
question
but
she
gave
me
no
time
to
do
so
for
with
extreme
volubility
she
began
to
tell
me
of
my
surprising
good
fortune
which
was
an
unanswerable
and
conclusive
proof
of
the
kindness
and
protection
of
providence
the
count
she
said
was
to
become
my
guardian
he
would
certainly
give
me
a
dowry
and
by
and
by
if
i
were
grateful
to
him
for
his
goodness
he
would
adopt
me
a
poor
fatherless
and
motherless
girl
and
i
should
bear
the
great
name
of
durtal
de
chalusse
and
inherit
an
immense
in
conclusion
she
said
that
there
was
no
limit
to
the
count
s
generosity
that
he
had
consented
to
reimburse
the
asylum
the
money
that
had
been
spent
on
me
that
he
had
offered
to
dower
i
do
not
know
how
many
poor
girls
and
that
he
had
promised
to
build
a
chapel
for
the
use
of
the
establishment
this
was
all
true
incredible
as
it
might
seem
that
very
morning
de
chalusse
had
called
at
the
asylum
declared
that
he
was
old
and
childless
a
bachelor
without
any
near
relatives
and
that
he
wished
to
adopt
a
poor
orphan
they
had
given
him
a
list
of
all
the
children
in
the
institution
and
he
had
chosen
me
a
mere
chance
my
dear
marguerite
repeated
the
superior
a
mere
chance
or
rather
a
true
it
did
indeed
seem
a
miracle
but
i
was
more
surprised
than
elated
i
longed
to
be
alone
so
as
to
deliberate
and
reflect
for
i
knew
that
i
was
free
to
accept
or
decline
this
dazzling
offer
i
timidly
asked
permission
to
return
to
my
employers
to
inform
them
of
what
had
happened
and
consult
with
them
but
my
request
was
refused
the
superior
told
me
that
i
must
deliberate
and
decide
alone
and
that
when
once
my
decision
was
taken
there
could
be
no
change
so
i
remained
at
the
asylum
and
dined
at
the
superior
s
table
and
during
the
night
i
occupied
the
room
of
a
sister
who
was
absent
what
surprised
me
most
of
all
was
the
deference
with
which
i
was
treated
the
sisters
all
seemed
to
consider
me
a
person
of
great
importance
and
yet
i
hesitated
my
indecision
may
seem
absurd
and
hypocritical
but
it
was
really
sincere
my
present
situation
was
certainly
by
no
means
an
enviable
one
but
the
worst
was
over
my
term
as
an
apprentice
had
nearly
expired
and
my
future
seemed
assured
my
future
what
could
it
be
with
the
count
de
chalusse
it
was
painted
in
such
brilliant
colors
that
it
frightened
me
why
had
the
count
chosen
me
in
preference
to
any
of
the
other
girls
was
it
really
chance
which
had
decided
him
in
his
choice
on
reflecting
the
miracle
seemed
to
me
to
have
been
prepared
in
advance
and
i
fancied
that
it
must
conceal
some
mystery
more
than
this
the
thought
of
yielding
myself
up
to
a
stranger
terrified
me
hours
had
been
granted
me
to
consider
my
decision
and
till
the
very
last
instant
i
remained
in
doubt
who
knows
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
if
i
had
returned
to
my
humble
life
at
all
events
i
should
have
been
spared
a
great
deal
of
sorrow
and
humiliation
but
i
lacked
the
courage
and
when
the
time
expired
i
consented
to
the
new
arrangement
should
i
live
a
thousand
years
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
i
left
the
foundling
asylum
to
become
the
count
de
chalusse
s
ward
it
was
a
saturday
and
i
had
given
my
answer
to
the
superior
on
the
evening
before
the
next
morning
i
received
a
visit
from
my
former
employers
who
having
been
informed
of
the
great
change
in
my
prospects
had
come
to
bid
me
the
cancelling
of
my
apprenticeship
had
at
first
caused
some
trouble
but
eventually
the
count
s
gold
silenced
their
objections
still
they
were
sorry
to
part
with
me
as
i
plainly
saw
their
eyes
were
moist
with
tears
they
were
sorry
to
lose
the
poor
little
servant
who
had
served
them
so
faithfully
at
the
same
time
however
i
noticed
evident
constraint
in
their
manner
they
no
longer
said
thee
and
thou
to
me
they
no
longer
spoke
roughly
but
they
said
you
and
addressed
me
as
poor
people
they
awkwardly
apologized
for
having
ventured
to
accept
my
services
declaring
in
the
same
breath
that
they
should
never
be
able
to
replace
me
at
the
same
price
madame
greloux
moreover
declared
that
she
should
never
forgive
herself
for
not
having
sharply
reproved
her
brother
for
his
abominable
conduct
he
was
a
fellow
she
said
as
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
he
had
dared
to
raise
his
eyes
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
felt
that
i
was
sincerely
loved
and
i
was
so
deeply
touched
that
if
my
decision
had
not
been
written
and
signed
i
should
certainly
have
returned
to
live
with
these
worthy
people
but
it
was
too
late
a
sister
came
to
tell
me
that
the
superior
wished
to
see
me
i
bade
father
and
mother
greloux
farewell
and
went
downstairs
in
the
superior
s
room
a
lady
and
two
laden
with
boxes
and
parcels
were
waiting
for
me
it
was
a
dressmaker
who
had
come
with
some
clothes
suited
to
my
new
station
in
life
i
was
told
that
she
had
been
sent
by
the
count
de
chalusse
this
great
nobleman
thought
of
everything
and
although
he
had
thirty
servants
to
do
his
bidding
he
never
disdained
to
occupy
himself
with
the
pettiest
details
so
for
the
first
time
i
was
arrayed
in
rustling
silk
and
clinging
cashmere
my
toilette
was
no
trifling
affair
all
the
good
sisters
clustered
round
me
and
tried
to
beautify
me
with
the
same
care
and
patience
as
they
would
have
displayed
in
adorning
the
virgin
s
statue
for
a
a
secret
instinct
warned
me
that
they
were
overdoing
the
matter
and
that
they
were
making
me
look
ridiculous
but
i
did
not
mind
i
allowed
them
to
please
themselves
i
could
still
feel
madame
greloux
s
tears
on
my
hand
and
the
scene
seemed
to
me
as
lugubrious
as
the
last
toilette
of
a
prisoner
under
sentence
of
death
when
they
had
completed
their
task
i
heard
a
buzz
of
admiration
round
me
if
the
sisters
were
worthy
of
belief
they
had
never
seen
such
a
wonderful
transformation
those
who
were
in
the
or
the
were
summoned
to
view
and
admire
me
and
some
of
the
elder
children
were
also
admitted
perhaps
i
was
intended
as
an
example
for
the
latter
for
i
heard
the
lady
superior
say
to
them
you
see
my
dear
children
the
result
of
good
behavior
be
diligent
and
dutiful
like
our
dear
marguerite
and
god
will
reward
you
as
he
has
rewarded
and
meantime
miserable
in
my
finery
i
waited
waited
for
de
chalusse
who
was
coming
to
take
me
away
at
the
appointed
hour
he
appeared
with
the
same
air
of
haughty
reserve
that
had
so
awed
me
on
the
occasion
of
our
first
meeting
he
scarcely
deigned
to
look
at
me
and
although
i
watched
him
with
poignant
anxiety
i
could
read
neither
blame
nor
approval
on
his
face
you
see
that
your
wishes
have
been
scrupulously
obeyed
monsieur
le
comte
said
the
superior
i
thank
you
he
replied
and
i
shall
prove
the
extent
of
my
gratitude
to
the
poor
children
under
your
then
turning
to
me
marguerite
he
said
take
leave
of
your
mothers
and
tell
them
that
you
will
never
forget
their
the
girl
paused
for
her
emotion
had
rendered
her
words
almost
unintelligible
but
with
an
effort
she
speedily
conquered
her
weakness
it
was
only
then
she
continued
that
i
realized
how
much
i
loved
these
poor
nuns
whom
i
had
sometimes
almost
cursed
i
felt
now
how
close
the
ties
were
that
bound
me
to
this
hospitable
roof
and
to
these
unfortunate
children
my
companions
in
misery
and
loneliness
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
my
heart
were
breaking
and
the
superior
who
was
generally
so
impassible
appeared
scarcely
less
moved
than
myself
at
last
de
chalusse
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
away
in
the
street
there
was
a
carriage
waiting
for
us
not
such
a
beautiful
one
as
that
which
had
been
sent
to
fetch
me
from
my
workshop
but
a
much
larger
one
with
trunks
and
boxes
piled
on
its
roof
it
was
drawn
by
four
gray
horses
i
felt
more
dead
than
alive
as
i
entered
the
carriage
and
took
the
seat
which
the
count
pointed
out
he
sat
down
opposite
to
me
all
the
sisters
had
assembled
at
the
door
of
the
asylum
and
even
the
superior
wept
without
making
any
attempt
to
hide
her
tears
farewell
they
all
cried
farewell
farewell
dear
child
don
t
forget
your
old
friends
we
shall
pray
for
your
alas
god
could
not
have
heard
their
prayers
at
a
sign
from
de
chalusse
a
footman
closed
the
door
the
postilions
cracked
their
whips
and
the
heavy
vehicle
rolled
away
the
die
was
cast
henceforth
an
impassable
gulf
was
to
separate
me
from
this
asylum
whither
i
had
been
carried
in
my
infancy
half
dead
and
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothes
from
which
every
mark
that
could
possibly
lead
to
identification
had
been
carefully
cut
away
whatever
my
future
might
prove
i
felt
that
my
past
was
gone
forever
but
i
was
too
greatly
agitated
even
to
think
and
crouching
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
i
watched
de
chalusse
with
the
poignant
anxiety
a
slave
displays
as
he
studies
his
new
master
ah
monsieur
what
a
wondrous
change
a
mask
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
the
count
s
face
his
lips
quivered
a
tender
light
beamed
in
his
eyes
and
he
drew
me
to
him
exclaiming
oh
marguerite
my
beloved
marguerite
at
last
at
last
he
sobbed
this
old
man
whom
i
had
thought
as
cold
and
as
insensible
as
marble
he
crushed
me
in
his
close
embrace
he
almost
smothered
me
with
kisses
and
i
was
frightfully
agitated
by
the
strange
indefinable
feeling
kindled
in
my
heart
but
i
no
longer
trembled
with
fear
an
inward
voice
whispered
that
this
was
but
the
renewal
of
a
former
tie
one
which
had
somehow
been
mysteriously
broken
however
as
i
remembered
the
superior
s
assertion
that
it
was
a
miracle
in
my
favor
a
wonderful
interposition
of
providence
i
had
courage
enough
to
ask
so
it
was
not
chance
that
guided
you
in
your
choice
my
question
seemed
to
take
him
by
surprise
poor
marguerite
he
murmured
dearly
beloved
child
for
years
i
have
been
laboring
to
bring
about
this
chance
instantly
all
the
romantic
stories
i
had
heard
in
the
asylum
recurred
to
my
mind
and
heaven
knows
there
are
plenty
of
these
stories
transmitted
by
the
sisters
from
generation
to
generation
till
they
have
become
a
sort
of
golden
legend
for
poor
foundlings
that
sad
formula
father
and
mother
unknown
which
figures
on
certificates
of
birth
acts
as
a
dangerous
stimulant
for
unhealthy
imaginations
and
leaves
an
open
door
for
the
most
extravagant
hopes
and
thus
influenced
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
face
of
the
count
de
chalusse
striving
to
discover
some
resemblance
in
his
features
to
my
own
but
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
my
intent
gaze
and
following
his
train
of
thought
he
muttered
chance
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
think
so
and
they
did
think
so
and
yet
the
cleverest
detectives
in
paris
from
old
tabaret
to
fortunat
both
masters
in
the
art
of
following
up
a
clue
had
exhausted
their
resources
in
helping
me
in
my
despairing
the
agony
of
suspense
i
was
enduring
had
become
intolerable
and
unable
to
restrain
myself
longer
i
exclaimed
with
a
wildly
throbbing
heart
then
you
are
my
father
monsieur
le
comte
he
pressed
his
hand
to
my
lips
with
such
violence
that
he
hurt
me
and
then
in
a
voice
quivering
with
excitement
he
replied
imprudent
girl
what
can
you
mean
forget
that
unfortunate
idea
never
utter
the
name
of
father
you
hear
me
never
i
forbid
it
he
had
become
extremely
pale
and
he
looked
anxiously
around
him
as
if
he
feared
that
some
one
had
overheard
me
as
if
he
had
forgotten
that
we
were
alone
in
a
carriage
which
was
dashing
onward
at
full
speed
i
was
stupefied
and
alarmed
by
the
sudden
terror
which
de
chalusse
had
displayed
and
could
not
control
what
could
it
all
mean
what
sorrowful
recollections
what
mysterious
apprehensions
had
my
words
aroused
in
the
count
s
mind
i
could
not
understand
or
imagine
why
he
should
regard
my
question
as
strange
or
unnatural
on
the
contrary
i
thought
it
perfectly
natural
dictated
as
it
had
been
by
circumstances
and
by
the
count
s
own
words
and
manner
and
in
spite
of
my
confusion
and
agitation
the
inexplicable
voice
which
we
call
presentiment
whispered
in
my
heart
he
has
forbidden
you
to
call
him
father
but
he
has
not
said
that
he
is
not
your
however
i
had
not
time
to
reflect
or
to
question
de
chalusse
any
more
though
at
that
moment
i
should
have
had
the
courage
to
do
so
afterward
i
did
not
dare
our
carriage
had
drawn
up
outside
the
railway
station
and
the
next
instant
we
alighted
then
for
the
first
time
i
learned
the
magical
power
of
money
i
a
poor
girl
reared
by
public
charity
and
who
for
three
years
had
worked
for
my
daily
bread
de
chalusse
found
the
servants
who
were
to
accompany
us
awaiting
him
they
had
thought
of
everything
and
made
every
possible
arrangement
for
our
comfort
i
had
scarcely
time
to
glance
round
me
before
we
were
on
the
platform
in
front
of
a
train
which
was
ready
to
start
i
perceived
the
very
carriage
that
had
brought
us
to
the
station
already
fastened
on
a
low
open
truck
and
i
was
advancing
to
climb
into
it
when
de
chalusse
stopped
me
not
there
said
he
come
with
i
followed
him
and
he
led
me
to
a
magnificent
saloon
carriage
much
higher
and
roomier
than
the
others
and
emblazoned
with
the
chalusse
this
is
our
carriage
dear
marguerite
he
said
i
got
in
the
whistle
sounded
and
the
train
started
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
growing
very
tired
big
drops
of
perspiration
stood
out
on
her
forehead
she
panted
for
breath
and
her
voice
began
to
fail
her
the
magistrate
was
almost
frightened
pray
rest
a
little
mademoiselle
he
entreated
there
is
no
but
she
shook
her
head
and
replied
it
is
better
to
go
on
i
should
never
have
courage
to
begin
again
if
i
and
thereupon
she
continued
i
had
never
gone
farther
than
versailles
this
journey
was
at
first
as
delightful
as
a
glimpse
into
our
carriage
was
one
of
those
costly
whims
which
some
millionaires
indulge
in
it
consisted
of
a
central
saloon
a
perfect
oeuvre
of
taste
and
luxury
with
two
compartments
at
either
end
furnished
with
comfortable
sleeping
accommodation
and
all
this
the
count
seemed
never
weary
of
repeating
was
mine
mine
alone
leaning
back
on
the
velvet
cushions
i
gazed
at
the
changing
landscape
as
the
train
rushed
madly
on
leaning
over
me
de
chalusse
named
all
the
towns
and
villages
we
passed
brunoy
melun
fontainebleau
villeneuve
sens
laroche
and
each
time
the
train
stopped
the
servants
came
to
ask
if
we
wished
for
anything
when
we
reached
lyons
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we
found
a
delicious
supper
awaiting
us
it
was
served
as
soon
as
we
alighted
and
in
due
time
we
were
warned
that
the
train
was
ready
to
start
and
then
we
resumed
our
journey
you
can
imagine
perhaps
how
marvellous
all
this
seemed
to
a
poor
little
apprentice
whose
only
ambition
a
week
before
was
to
earn
five
francs
a
day
what
a
change
indeed
at
last
the
count
made
me
retire
to
one
of
the
compartments
where
i
soon
fell
asleep
abandoning
my
efforts
to
distinguish
what
was
dreamlike
in
my
situation
from
reality
however
when
i
woke
up
i
became
terribly
anxious
i
asked
myself
what
was
awaiting
me
at
the
end
of
this
long
journey
de
chalusse
s
manner
continued
kind
and
even
affectionate
but
he
had
regained
his
accustomed
reserve
and
and
i
realized
that
it
would
be
useless
on
my
part
to
question
him
at
last
after
a
thirty
hours
journey
by
rail
we
again
entered
the
count
s
berline
drawn
by
and
eventually
de
chalusse
said
to
me
here
is
cannes
we
are
at
our
journey
s
in
this
town
which
is
one
of
the
most
charming
that
overlook
the
blue
waters
of
the
mediterranean
the
count
owned
a
palace
embowered
among
lovely
only
a
few
steps
from
the
sea
and
in
full
view
of
the
myrtle
and
laurel
groves
which
deck
the
isles
of
sainte
marguerite
he
told
me
that
he
proposed
spending
a
few
months
here
in
seclusion
so
as
to
give
me
time
to
accustom
myself
to
my
new
position
and
the
luxury
that
surrounded
me
i
was
indeed
extremely
awkward
and
my
excessive
timidity
was
increased
by
my
pride
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
what
to
do
i
did
not
know
how
to
use
my
hands
nor
how
to
walk
nor
how
to
carry
myself
everything
embarrassed
and
frightened
me
and
i
was
conscious
of
my
awkwardness
without
being
able
to
remedy
it
i
saw
my
blunders
and
knew
that
i
spoke
a
different
language
to
that
which
was
spoken
around
me
and
yet
the
memory
of
cannes
will
ever
be
dear
to
me
for
there
i
first
met
the
only
friend
i
have
now
left
in
this
world
i
did
not
exchange
a
word
with
him
but
by
the
quickened
throbbings
of
my
heart
when
our
eyes
met
i
felt
that
he
would
exert
a
powerful
influence
over
my
life
and
events
have
since
proved
that
i
was
not
deceived
at
that
time
however
he
was
a
stranger
to
me
and
nothing
on
earth
would
have
induced
me
to
make
inquiries
concerning
him
it
was
only
by
chance
i
learned
that
he
lived
in
paris
that
his
name
was
pascal
and
that
he
had
come
south
as
a
companion
to
a
sick
friend
by
a
single
word
the
count
could
have
insured
the
happiness
of
my
life
and
his
own
but
he
did
not
speak
it
he
was
the
kindest
and
most
indulgent
of
guardians
and
i
was
often
affected
to
tears
by
his
tenderness
but
although
my
slightest
wish
was
law
he
did
not
grant
me
his
confidence
the
secret
the
mystery
that
stood
between
us
was
like
a
wall
of
ice
still
i
was
gradually
becoming
accustomed
to
my
new
life
and
my
mind
was
regaining
its
equilibrium
when
one
evening
the
count
returned
home
more
agitated
and
excited
if
possible
than
on
the
day
of
my
departure
from
the
asylum
he
summoned
his
valet
and
in
a
tone
that
admitted
no
reply
he
exclaimed
i
wish
to
leave
cannes
at
once
i
must
start
in
less
than
an
hour
so
procure
some
and
in
answer
to
my
inquiring
glance
he
said
it
must
be
it
would
be
folly
to
hesitate
each
moment
increases
the
peril
that
threatens
i
was
very
young
inexperienced
and
totally
ignorant
of
life
but
my
sufferings
my
loneliness
and
the
prospect
of
being
compelled
to
rely
upon
myself
had
imparted
to
my
mind
that
precocious
maturity
which
is
so
often
observed
among
the
children
of
the
poor
knowing
from
the
very
first
that
there
was
some
mystery
connected
with
the
count
s
life
i
had
studied
him
with
a
child
s
patient
sagacity
a
sagacity
which
is
all
the
more
dangerous
as
it
is
unsuspected
and
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
constant
dread
rendered
his
life
a
burden
could
it
be
for
himself
that
he
trembled
this
great
nobleman
who
was
so
powerful
by
reason
of
his
exalted
rank
his
connections
and
his
wealth
certainly
not
was
it
for
me
then
undoubtedly
it
was
but
why
it
had
not
taken
me
long
to
discover
that
he
was
concealing
me
or
at
least
that
he
endeavored
by
all
means
in
his
power
to
prevent
my
presence
in
his
house
from
being
known
beyond
a
very
limited
circle
of
friends
our
hurried
departure
from
cannes
confirmed
me
in
my
impression
it
might
have
been
truly
called
a
flight
we
left
that
same
evening
at
eleven
o
clock
in
a
pouring
rain
with
the
first
horses
that
could
be
procured
our
only
attendant
was
the
count
s
valet
not
casimir
the
man
who
insulted
me
a
little
while
ago
but
another
man
an
old
and
valued
servant
who
has
since
died
unfortunately
and
who
possessed
his
master
s
entire
confidence
the
other
servants
were
dismissed
with
a
princely
gratuity
and
told
to
disperse
two
days
after
our
departure
we
did
not
return
to
paris
but
journeyed
toward
the
italian
frontier
and
on
arriving
at
nice
in
the
dead
of
night
we
drove
directly
to
the
quay
the
postilions
unharnessed
the
horses
and
we
remained
in
the
carriage
the
valet
however
hastened
off
and
more
than
two
hours
elapsed
before
he
returned
he
declared
that
he
had
found
it
very
difficult
to
procure
what
he
wished
for
but
that
at
last
by
a
prodigal
outlay
of
money
he
had
succeeded
in
overcoming
all
obstacles
what
de
chalusse
desired
was
a
vessel
ready
for
sea
and
the
bark
which
the
valet
had
chartered
now
came
up
to
the
quay
our
carriage
was
put
on
board
we
went
below
and
before
daybreak
we
were
under
way
three
days
later
we
were
in
genoa
registered
under
a
false
name
in
a
second
class
hotel
while
we
were
on
the
open
sea
the
count
had
seemed
to
be
less
agitated
but
now
he
was
far
from
calm
and
the
precautions
he
took
proved
that
he
still
feared
pursuit
a
malefactor
flying
from
justice
could
not
have
taken
greater
pains
to
mislead
the
detectives
on
his
track
and
facts
proved
conclusively
that
i
was
the
sole
cause
of
the
count
s
apprehension
on
one
occasion
i
even
heard
him
discussing
with
his
valet
the
feasibility
of
clothing
me
in
masculine
attire
and
it
was
only
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
a
suitable
costume
that
prevented
him
from
carrying
this
project
into
execution
i
ought
to
mention
however
that
the
servant
did
not
share
his
master
s
anxiety
for
three
or
four
times
i
overheard
him
saying
the
count
is
too
good
to
worry
himself
so
much
about
such
bad
stock
besides
she
won
t
overtake
us
it
isn
t
certain
that
she
has
even
followed
us
how
can
she
know
anything
about
it
she
who
was
she
this
is
what
i
racked
my
brain
to
discover
but
without
success
i
must
confess
monsieur
that
being
of
a
practical
nature
and
not
in
the
least
degree
romantic
i
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
peril
chiefly
existed
in
the
count
s
imagination
or
that
he
greatly
exaggerated
it
still
he
suffered
none
the
less
on
that
account
as
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
following
month
was
spent
in
hurried
journeys
from
one
italian
city
to
another
it
was
the
end
of
may
before
de
chalusse
would
consent
to
return
to
france
and
then
we
went
direct
to
lyons
we
had
spent
a
couple
of
days
there
when
the
count
informed
me
that
prudence
required
us
to
separate
for
a
time
that
our
safety
demanded
this
sacrifice
and
without
giving
me
time
to
say
a
word
he
began
to
explain
the
advantages
that
would
accrue
from
such
an
arrangement
i
was
extremely
ignorant
and
he
wished
me
to
profit
by
our
temporary
separation
to
raise
my
knowledge
to
a
level
with
my
new
social
position
he
had
accordingly
made
arrangements
for
me
to
enter
the
convent
of
an
educational
establishment
which
is
as
celebrated
in
the
department
of
the
rhone
as
the
convent
des
oiseaux
is
in
paris
he
added
that
it
would
not
be
prudent
for
him
to
visit
me
and
he
made
me
solemnly
promise
that
i
would
never
mention
his
name
to
any
of
my
schoolmates
i
was
to
send
any
letters
i
might
write
to
an
address
which
he
would
give
me
and
he
would
sign
his
answers
with
a
fictitious
name
he
also
told
me
that
the
lady
superior
of
knew
his
secret
and
that
i
could
confide
in
her
he
was
so
restless
and
so
miserably
unhappy
on
the
day
when
he
acquainted
me
with
these
plans
that
i
really
believed
him
insane
nevertheless
i
replied
that
i
would
obey
him
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
not
ill
pleased
at
the
thought
of
the
change
my
life
with
de
chalusse
was
a
monotonous
and
cheerless
one
i
was
almost
dying
of
ennui
for
i
had
been
accustomed
to
work
bustle
and
confusion
with
the
greloux
and
i
felt
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
finding
myself
among
companions
of
my
own
age
unfortunately
de
chalusse
had
forgotten
one
circumstance
which
made
my
two
years
sojourn
at
a
lingering
and
cruel
agony
at
first
i
was
kindly
treated
by
my
schoolmates
a
new
pupil
is
always
welcome
for
her
arrival
relieves
the
monotony
of
but
it
was
not
long
before
my
companions
wished
to
know
my
name
and
i
had
none
other
than
marguerite
to
give
them
they
were
astonished
and
wished
to
know
who
my
parents
were
i
could
not
tell
an
untruth
and
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
i
knew
nothing
at
all
respecting
my
father
or
my
mother
after
that
the
bastard
for
such
was
the
name
they
gave
me
was
soon
condemned
to
isolation
no
one
would
associate
with
me
during
no
one
would
sit
beside
me
in
the
at
the
piano
lesson
the
girl
who
played
after
me
pretended
to
wipe
the
keyboard
carefully
before
commencing
her
exercises
i
struggled
bravely
against
this
unjust
ostracism
but
all
in
vain
i
was
so
unlike
these
other
girls
in
character
and
disposition
and
i
had
moreover
been
guilty
of
a
great
imprudence
i
had
been
silly
enough
to
show
my
companions
the
costly
jewels
which
de
chalusse
had
given
me
but
which
i
never
wore
and
on
two
occasions
i
had
proved
to
them
that
i
had
more
money
at
my
disposal
than
all
the
other
pupils
together
if
i
had
been
poor
they
would
perhaps
have
treated
me
with
affected
sympathy
but
as
i
was
rich
i
became
an
enemy
it
was
war
and
one
of
those
merciless
wars
which
sometimes
rage
so
furiously
in
convents
despite
their
seeming
quiet
i
should
surprise
you
monsieur
if
i
told
you
what
refined
torture
these
daughters
of
noblemen
invented
to
gratify
their
petty
spite
i
might
have
complained
to
the
superior
but
i
scorned
to
do
so
i
buried
my
sorrow
deep
in
my
heart
as
i
had
done
years
before
and
i
firmly
resolved
never
to
show
ought
but
a
smiling
placid
face
so
as
to
prove
to
my
enemies
that
they
were
powerless
to
disturb
my
peace
of
mind
study
became
my
refuge
and
consolation
and
i
plunged
into
work
with
the
energy
of
despair
i
should
probably
still
live
at
now
had
it
not
been
for
a
trivial
circumstance
one
day
i
had
a
quarrel
with
my
most
determined
enemy
a
girl
named
anais
de
rochecote
i
was
a
thousand
times
right
and
i
would
not
yield
the
superior
dared
not
tell
me
i
was
wrong
anais
was
furious
and
wrote
i
don
t
know
what
falsehoods
to
her
mother
madame
de
rochecote
thereupon
interested
the
mothers
of
five
or
six
other
pupils
in
her
daughter
s
quarrel
and
one
evening
these
ladies
came
in
a
body
and
nobly
and
courageously
demanded
that
the
bastard
should
be
expelled
it
was
impossible
outrageous
monstrous
they
declared
that
their
daughters
should
be
compelled
to
associate
with
a
girl
like
me
a
nameless
girl
who
humiliated
the
other
girls
with
her
wealth
the
superior
tried
to
take
my
part
but
these
ladies
declared
they
would
take
their
daughters
from
the
convent
if
i
were
not
sent
away
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
was
sacrificed
summoned
by
telegraph
de
chalusse
hastened
to
lyons
and
two
days
later
i
left
with
jeers
and
opprobrious
epithets
ringing
in
my
x
once
before
that
very
morning
the
magistrate
had
witnessed
a
display
of
the
virile
energy
with
which
misfortune
and
suffering
had
endowed
this
proud
but
naturally
timid
girl
but
he
was
none
the
less
surprised
at
the
sudden
explosion
of
hatred
which
he
now
beheld
for
it
was
hatred
the
way
in
which
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
voice
had
quivered
as
she
pronounced
the
name
of
anais
de
rochecote
proved
unmistakably
that
hers
was
one
of
those
haughty
natures
that
never
forget
an
insult
all
signs
of
fatigue
had
now
disappeared
she
had
sprung
from
her
chair
and
remembrance
of
the
shameful
cowardly
affront
she
had
received
had
brought
a
vivid
flush
to
her
cheeks
and
a
bright
gleam
to
her
eyes
this
atrocious
humiliation
happened
scarcely
a
year
ago
monsieur
she
resumed
and
there
is
but
little
left
for
me
to
tell
you
my
expulsion
from
made
de
chalusse
frantic
with
indignation
he
knew
something
that
i
was
ignorant
of
that
madame
de
rochecote
who
enacted
the
part
of
a
severe
and
implacable
censor
was
famed
for
the
laxity
of
her
morals
the
count
s
first
impulse
was
to
wreak
vengeance
on
my
persecutors
for
in
spite
of
his
usual
coolness
de
chalusse
had
a
furious
temper
at
times
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
dissuaded
him
from
challenging
general
de
rochecote
who
was
living
at
the
time
however
it
now
became
necessary
to
make
some
other
arrangements
for
me
de
chalusse
offered
to
find
another
school
promising
to
take
such
precautions
as
would
insure
my
peace
of
mind
but
i
interrupted
him
before
he
had
spoken
a
dozen
words
declaring
i
would
rather
return
to
the
than
chance
another
such
experiment
and
what
i
said
i
meant
a
subterfuge
a
fictitious
name
for
instance
could
alone
shield
me
from
persecution
similar
to
what
i
had
endured
at
but
i
knew
that
i
was
incapable
of
playing
such
a
part
i
felt
that
i
should
somehow
confess
everything
my
firmness
imparted
some
resolution
to
de
chalusse
he
exclaimed
with
an
oath
that
i
was
right
that
he
was
weary
of
all
this
deception
and
concealment
and
that
he
would
make
arrangements
to
have
me
near
him
yes
he
concluded
embracing
me
the
die
is
cast
come
what
may
however
these
measures
required
a
certain
delay
and
in
the
meantime
he
decided
to
install
me
in
paris
which
is
the
only
place
where
one
can
successfully
hide
from
prying
eyes
he
purchased
a
small
but
convenient
house
surrounded
by
a
garden
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
luxembourg
palace
and
here
he
installed
me
with
two
old
women
and
a
trusty
as
i
needed
a
chaperon
he
went
in
quest
of
one
and
found
madame
on
hearing
this
name
the
magistrate
gave
the
young
girl
a
searching
look
as
if
he
hoped
to
discover
what
estimate
she
had
formed
of
the
housekeeper
s
character
as
well
as
what
degree
of
confidence
she
had
granted
her
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
face
remained
unaltered
in
expression
after
so
many
trials
she
resumed
i
thought
i
should
now
find
rest
and
peace
yes
i
believed
so
and
the
few
months
i
spent
in
that
quiet
house
will
be
the
happiest
of
my
life
i
am
sure
of
it
judge
of
my
surprise
when
on
going
down
into
the
little
garden
on
the
second
day
after
my
arrival
i
saw
the
young
man
whom
i
had
met
at
cannes
and
whose
face
had
lingered
in
my
memory
for
more
than
two
years
as
the
type
of
all
that
was
best
and
noblest
in
the
human
countenance
he
was
standing
near
the
gate
a
cloud
passed
before
my
eyes
what
mysterious
freak
of
fate
had
caused
him
to
pause
there
at
that
particular
moment
this
much
is
certain
he
recognized
me
as
i
had
recognized
him
he
bowed
smiling
somewhat
and
i
fled
indoors
again
indignant
with
myself
for
not
being
angry
at
his
audacity
i
made
many
plans
that
day
but
the
next
morning
at
the
same
hour
i
hid
myself
behind
a
venetian
blind
and
saw
him
pause
at
the
gate
and
gaze
at
the
garden
with
evident
anxiety
i
soon
learned
that
he
lived
near
by
with
his
widowed
mother
and
twice
a
day
when
he
went
to
the
palais
de
justice
and
returned
he
passed
my
her
cheeks
were
crimson
now
her
eyes
were
lowered
and
she
was
evidently
embarrassed
but
suddenly
as
if
ashamed
of
her
blushes
she
proudly
raised
her
head
and
said
in
a
firmer
voice
shall
i
tell
you
our
simple
story
is
it
necessary
i
should
not
have
concealed
anything
that
has
passed
from
my
mother
if
i
had
been
so
happy
as
to
possess
a
mother
a
few
moments
conversation
now
and
then
the
exchange
of
a
few
letters
the
pressure
of
a
hand
through
the
garden
gate
and
that
is
all
still
i
have
been
guilty
of
a
grave
and
irreparable
fault
i
have
disobeyed
the
one
rule
of
my
life
frankness
and
i
am
cruelly
punished
for
doing
so
i
did
not
tell
all
this
to
de
chalusse
in
fact
i
dared
not
i
was
ashamed
of
my
cowardice
from
day
to
day
i
vowed
that
i
would
confess
everything
and
yet
i
procrastinated
i
said
to
myself
every
night
it
shall
be
done
but
when
the
morrow
came
i
said
i
will
give
myself
another
day
just
one
more
indeed
my
courage
failed
me
when
i
thought
of
the
count
s
aristocratic
prejudices
and
besides
i
knew
how
ambitious
he
was
for
my
future
on
the
other
hand
moreover
pascal
was
always
pleading
don
t
speak
now
my
circumstances
are
constantly
improving
the
day
is
not
far
off
when
i
shall
be
able
to
offer
you
wealth
and
fame
when
that
day
comes
i
will
go
to
your
guardian
and
ask
him
for
your
hand
but
in
heaven
s
name
don
t
speak
i
understood
pascal
s
motives
well
enough
the
count
s
immense
fortune
frightened
him
and
he
feared
that
he
would
be
accused
of
being
a
so
i
waited
with
that
secret
anguish
which
still
haunts
those
who
have
been
unhappy
even
when
their
present
is
peaceful
and
their
future
seems
bright
i
kept
my
secret
saying
to
myself
that
such
happiness
was
not
meant
for
me
that
it
would
soon
take
flight
it
took
flight
all
too
soon
one
morning
i
heard
a
carriage
draw
up
outside
our
door
and
the
next
moment
the
count
de
chalusse
entered
the
everything
is
ready
to
receive
you
at
the
hotel
de
chalusse
marguerite
said
he
come
he
ceremoniously
offered
me
his
arm
and
i
accompanied
him
i
could
not
even
leave
a
message
for
pascal
for
i
had
never
made
a
confidante
of
madame
leon
still
a
faint
hope
sustained
me
i
thought
that
the
precautions
taken
by
de
chalusse
would
somewhat
dispel
the
uncertainty
of
my
position
and
furnish
me
at
least
with
some
idea
of
the
vague
danger
which
threatened
me
but
no
his
efforts
so
far
as
i
could
discover
had
been
confined
to
changing
his
servants
our
life
in
this
grand
house
was
the
same
as
it
had
been
at
cannes
even
more
secluded
if
that
were
possible
the
count
had
aged
considerably
it
was
evident
that
he
was
sinking
beneath
the
burden
of
some
sorrow
i
am
condemning
you
to
a
cheerless
and
melancholy
youth
he
sometimes
said
to
me
but
it
will
not
last
forever
patience
patience
did
he
really
love
me
i
think
so
but
his
affection
showed
itself
in
a
strange
manner
sometimes
his
voice
was
so
tender
that
my
heart
was
touched
at
others
there
was
a
look
of
hatred
in
his
eyes
which
terrified
me
occasionally
he
was
severe
almost
to
brutality
and
then
the
next
moment
he
would
implore
me
to
forgive
him
order
the
carriage
take
me
with
him
to
his
jewellers
and
insist
upon
me
accepting
some
costly
ornaments
madame
leon
declares
that
my
jewels
are
worth
more
than
twenty
thousand
francs
at
times
i
wondered
if
his
capricious
affection
and
sternness
were
really
intended
for
myself
it
often
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
only
a
shadow
the
phantom
of
some
absent
person
in
his
eyes
it
is
certain
that
he
often
requested
me
to
dress
myself
or
to
arrange
my
hair
in
a
certain
fashion
to
wear
such
and
such
a
color
or
to
use
a
particular
perfume
which
he
gave
me
frequently
when
i
was
moving
about
the
house
he
suddenly
exclaimed
marguerite
i
entreat
you
remain
just
where
you
are
i
obeyed
him
but
the
illusion
had
already
vanished
a
sob
or
an
oath
would
come
from
his
lips
and
then
in
an
angry
voice
he
would
bid
me
leave
the
the
magistrate
did
not
raise
his
eyes
from
his
talismanic
ring
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
it
had
fascinated
him
still
his
expression
denoted
profound
commiseration
and
he
shook
his
head
thoughtfully
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
that
this
unfortunate
young
girl
had
been
the
victim
not
precisely
of
a
madman
but
of
one
of
those
maniacs
who
have
just
enough
reason
left
to
invent
the
tortures
they
inflict
upon
those
around
them
speaking
more
slowly
than
before
as
if
she
were
desirous
of
attracting
increased
attention
on
the
magistrate
s
part
mademoiselle
marguerite
now
continued
if
i
reminded
de
chalusse
of
a
person
whom
he
had
formerly
loved
that
person
may
have
been
my
mother
i
say
may
have
been
because
i
am
not
certain
of
it
all
my
efforts
to
discover
the
truth
were
unavailing
de
chalusse
seemed
to
take
a
malicious
pleasure
in
destroying
all
my
theories
and
in
upsetting
the
conjectures
which
he
had
encouraged
himself
only
hours
previously
heaven
only
knows
how
anxiously
i
listened
to
his
slightest
word
and
it
can
be
easily
understood
why
i
did
so
my
strange
and
compromising
connection
with
him
drove
me
nearly
frantic
it
was
not
strange
that
people
s
suspicions
were
aroused
true
he
had
changed
all
his
servants
before
my
arrival
here
but
he
had
requested
madame
leon
to
remain
with
me
and
who
can
tell
what
reports
she
may
have
circulated
it
has
often
happened
that
when
returning
from
mass
on
sundays
i
have
overheard
persons
say
look
there
is
the
count
de
chalusse
s
mistress
oh
not
a
single
humiliation
has
been
spared
me
not
a
single
one
however
on
one
point
i
did
not
feel
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
the
count
had
known
my
mother
he
frequently
alluded
to
her
sometimes
with
an
outburst
of
passion
which
made
me
think
that
he
had
once
adored
and
still
loved
her
sometimes
with
insults
and
curses
which
impressed
me
with
the
idea
that
she
had
cruelly
injured
him
but
most
frequently
he
reproached
her
for
having
unhesitatingly
sacrificed
me
to
insure
her
own
safety
he
said
she
could
have
had
no
heart
and
that
it
was
an
unheard
of
incomprehensible
and
monstrous
thing
that
a
woman
could
enjoy
luxury
and
wealth
undisturbed
by
remorse
knowing
that
her
innocent
and
defenceless
child
was
exposed
all
the
while
to
the
hardships
and
temptations
of
abject
poverty
i
was
also
certain
that
my
mother
was
a
married
woman
for
de
chalusse
alluded
to
her
husband
more
than
once
he
hated
him
with
a
terrible
hatred
one
evening
when
he
was
more
communicative
than
usual
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
great
danger
he
dreaded
for
me
came
either
from
my
mother
or
her
husband
he
afterward
did
his
best
to
counteract
this
impression
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
convincing
me
that
his
previous
assertion
was
the
magistrate
looked
searchingly
at
mademoiselle
marguerite
then
those
letters
which
we
found
just
now
in
the
escritoire
are
from
your
mother
mademoiselle
he
remarked
the
girl
blushed
she
had
previously
been
questioned
respecting
these
letters
and
she
had
then
made
no
reply
now
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
quietly
said
your
opinion
coincides
with
mine
thereupon
as
if
she
wished
to
avoid
any
further
questioning
on
the
subject
she
hurriedly
continued
at
last
a
new
and
even
greater
trouble
came
a
positive
calamity
which
made
me
forget
the
disgrace
attached
to
my
birth
one
morning
at
breakfast
about
a
month
ago
the
count
informed
me
that
he
expected
two
guests
to
dinner
that
evening
this
was
such
an
unusual
occurrence
that
i
was
struck
speechless
with
astonishment
it
is
extraordinary
i
admit
he
added
gayly
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
de
fondege
and
the
marquis
de
valorsay
will
dine
here
this
evening
so
my
dear
marguerite
look
your
prettiest
in
honor
of
our
old
at
six
o
clock
the
two
gentlemen
arrived
together
i
was
well
acquainted
with
de
fondege
the
general
as
he
was
commonly
called
he
was
the
count
s
only
intimate
friend
and
often
visited
us
but
i
had
never
before
seen
the
marquis
de
valorsay
nor
had
i
ever
heard
his
name
until
de
chalusse
mentioned
it
that
morning
i
don
t
pretend
to
judge
him
i
will
only
say
that
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
the
dislike
i
felt
for
him
bordered
on
aversion
my
false
position
rendered
his
close
scrutiny
actually
painful
to
me
and
his
attentions
and
compliments
pleased
me
no
better
at
dinner
he
addressed
his
conversation
exclusively
to
me
and
i
particularly
remember
a
certain
picture
he
drew
of
a
model
household
which
positively
disgusted
me
in
his
opinion
a
husband
ought
to
content
himself
with
being
his
wife
s
prime
minister
the
slave
of
her
slightest
caprice
he
intended
if
he
married
to
allow
the
marquise
de
valorsay
perfect
freedom
with
an
unlimited
amount
of
money
the
handsomest
carriages
and
the
most
magnificent
diamonds
in
paris
everything
indeed
that
could
gratify
her
vanity
and
render
her
existence
a
fairylike
dream
with
such
ideas
on
her
husband
s
part
the
marchioness
will
be
very
difficult
to
please
if
she
is
not
contented
with
her
lot
he
added
glancing
covertly
at
me
this
exasperated
me
beyond
endurance
and
i
dryly
replied
the
mere
thought
of
such
a
husband
would
drive
me
to
the
shelter
of
a
he
seemed
considerably
disconcerted
and
i
noticed
that
the
general
i
mean
de
fondege
gave
him
a
mischievous
look
however
when
the
gentlemen
had
gone
de
chalusse
scolded
me
severely
he
said
that
my
sentimental
philosophy
was
quite
out
of
place
in
a
and
that
my
ideas
of
life
marriage
and
duty
could
only
have
been
gained
in
a
foundling
asylum
as
i
attempted
to
reply
he
interrupted
me
to
sound
the
praises
of
the
marquis
de
valorsay
who
not
only
came
of
an
ancient
family
and
possessed
immense
unencumbered
estates
but
was
a
talented
handsome
man
into
the
bargain
in
short
one
of
those
favored
mortals
whom
all
young
girls
sigh
for
the
scales
fell
from
my
eyes
i
instantly
understood
that
de
chalusse
had
selected
the
marquis
de
valorsay
to
be
my
husband
and
thus
the
marquis
had
designedly
explained
his
matrimonial
programme
for
my
benefit
it
was
a
snare
to
catch
the
bird
i
felt
indignant
that
he
should
suppose
me
so
wanting
in
delicacy
of
feeling
and
nobility
of
character
as
to
be
dazzled
by
the
life
of
display
and
facile
pleasure
which
he
had
depicted
i
had
disliked
him
at
first
and
now
i
despised
him
for
it
was
impossible
to
misunderstand
the
shameless
proposal
concealed
beneath
his
words
he
offered
me
my
liberty
in
exchange
for
my
fortune
that
is
only
a
fair
contract
one
might
say
perhaps
so
but
if
he
were
willing
to
do
this
for
a
certain
amount
of
money
what
would
he
not
do
for
a
sum
twice
or
thrice
as
large
such
were
my
impressions
though
i
asked
myself
again
and
again
if
i
were
not
mistaken
no
the
events
that
followed
only
confirmed
my
suspicions
three
days
later
the
marquis
came
again
his
visit
was
to
the
count
and
they
held
a
long
conference
in
this
study
having
occasion
to
enter
the
room
after
the
marquis
s
departure
i
noticed
on
the
table
a
number
of
title
deeds
which
he
had
probably
brought
for
the
count
s
inspection
on
the
following
week
there
was
another
conference
and
this
time
a
lawyer
was
present
any
further
doubts
i
might
have
felt
were
dispelled
by
madame
leon
who
was
always
well
informed
thanks
to
her
habit
of
listening
at
the
keyholes
they
are
talking
of
marrying
you
to
the
marquis
de
valorsay
i
heard
them
she
remarked
to
me
however
the
information
did
not
terrify
me
i
had
profited
by
the
time
allowed
me
for
reflection
and
i
had
decided
upon
the
course
i
should
pursue
i
am
timid
but
i
am
not
weak
and
i
was
determined
to
resist
de
chalusse
s
will
in
this
matter
even
if
it
became
necessary
for
me
to
leave
his
house
and
renounce
all
hopes
of
the
wealth
he
had
promised
me
still
i
said
nothing
to
pascal
of
my
mental
struggle
and
final
determination
i
did
not
wish
to
bind
him
by
the
advice
which
he
would
certainly
have
given
me
i
had
his
troth
and
that
sufficed
and
it
was
with
a
thrill
of
joy
that
i
said
to
myself
what
does
it
matter
if
de
chalusse
should
be
so
angered
by
my
refusal
to
obey
him
as
to
drive
me
from
his
house
it
will
rather
be
so
much
the
better
pascal
will
protect
but
resistance
is
only
possible
when
you
are
attacked
and
de
chalusse
did
not
even
allude
to
the
subject
perhaps
because
affairs
had
not
yet
been
satisfactorily
arranged
between
the
marquis
and
himself
possibly
because
he
wished
to
deprive
me
of
the
power
to
oppose
him
by
taking
me
unawares
it
would
have
been
great
imprudence
on
my
part
to
broach
the
subject
myself
and
so
i
waited
calmly
and
resignedly
storing
up
all
my
energy
for
the
decisive
hour
i
willingly
confess
that
i
am
not
a
heroine
of
romance
i
do
not
look
upon
money
with
the
contempt
it
deserves
i
was
resolved
to
wed
solely
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
my
heart
but
i
wished
and
hoped
that
de
chalusse
would
give
me
not
a
fortune
but
a
modest
dowry
he
had
become
more
communicative
than
usual
on
money
matters
and
took
no
pains
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
engaged
in
raising
the
largest
possible
amount
of
ready
cash
he
received
frequent
visits
from
his
stockbroker
and
sometimes
when
the
latter
had
left
him
he
showed
me
rolls
of
and
packages
of
bonds
saying
as
he
did
so
you
see
that
your
future
is
assured
my
dear
i
am
only
doing
the
count
justice
when
i
say
that
my
future
was
a
subject
of
constant
anxiety
to
him
during
the
last
few
months
of
his
life
less
than
a
fortnight
after
he
had
taken
me
from
the
asylum
he
drew
up
a
will
in
which
he
adopted
me
and
made
me
his
sole
legatee
but
he
afterward
destroyed
this
document
on
the
plea
that
it
did
not
afford
me
sufficient
security
and
a
dozen
others
shared
the
same
fate
for
his
mind
was
constantly
occupied
with
the
subject
and
he
seemed
to
have
a
presentiment
that
his
death
would
be
a
sudden
one
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
he
seemed
less
anxious
to
endow
me
with
his
fortune
than
to
frustrate
the
hopes
of
some
persons
i
did
not
know
when
he
burned
his
last
will
in
my
presence
he
remarked
this
document
is
useless
they
would
contest
it
and
probably
succeed
in
having
it
set
aside
i
have
thought
of
a
better
way
i
have
found
an
expedient
which
will
provide
for
all
and
as
i
ventured
some
timid
objection
for
it
was
repugnant
to
my
sense
of
honor
to
act
as
an
instrument
of
vengeance
or
injustice
or
assist
even
passively
in
despoiling
any
person
of
his
rightful
inheritance
he
harshly
almost
brutally
replied
mind
your
own
business
i
will
disappoint
the
folks
who
are
waiting
for
my
property
as
they
deserve
to
be
disappointed
they
covet
my
estates
do
they
very
well
they
shall
have
them
i
will
leave
them
my
property
but
they
shall
find
it
mortgaged
to
its
full
unfortunate
man
all
his
plans
have
failed
the
heirs
whom
he
hated
so
bitterly
and
whom
i
don
t
even
know
whose
existence
people
have
not
even
suspected
can
now
come
and
they
will
find
the
wealth
he
was
determined
to
deprive
them
of
intact
he
dreamed
of
a
brilliant
destiny
for
me
a
proud
name
and
the
rank
of
a
marchioness
and
he
has
not
even
succeeded
in
protecting
me
from
the
most
shameful
insults
i
have
been
accused
of
theft
before
his
body
was
even
cold
he
wished
to
make
me
rich
frightfully
rich
and
he
has
not
left
me
enough
to
buy
my
bread
literally
not
enough
to
buy
bread
he
was
in
constant
terror
concerning
my
safety
and
he
died
without
even
telling
me
what
were
the
mysterious
dangers
which
threatened
me
without
even
telling
me
something
which
i
am
morally
certain
of
that
he
was
my
father
he
raised
me
against
my
will
to
the
highest
social
position
he
placed
that
wonderful
talisman
gold
in
my
hand
he
showed
me
the
world
at
my
feet
and
suddenly
he
allowed
me
to
fall
even
to
lower
depths
of
misery
than
those
in
which
he
found
me
ah
de
chalusse
it
would
have
been
far
better
for
me
if
you
had
left
me
in
the
foundling
asylum
to
have
earned
my
own
bread
and
yet
i
freely
forgive
mademoiselle
marguerite
reflected
for
a
moment
questioning
her
memory
to
ascertain
if
she
had
told
everything
if
she
had
forgotten
any
particulars
of
importance
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
nothing
more
to
add
she
approached
the
magistrate
and
with
impressive
solemnity
of
tone
and
manner
exclaimed
my
life
up
to
the
present
hour
is
now
as
well
known
to
you
as
it
is
to
myself
you
know
what
even
the
friend
who
is
my
only
hope
does
not
know
as
yet
and
now
when
i
tell
him
what
i
really
am
will
he
think
me
unworthy
of
him
the
magistrate
sprang
to
his
feet
impelled
by
an
irresistible
force
two
big
tears
the
first
he
had
shed
for
years
trembled
on
his
eyelashes
and
coursed
down
his
furrowed
cheeks
you
are
a
noble
creature
my
child
he
replied
in
a
voice
faltering
with
emotion
and
if
i
had
a
son
i
should
deem
myself
fortunate
if
he
chose
a
wife
like
she
clasped
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
intense
joy
and
relief
and
then
sank
into
an
murmuring
oh
thanks
monsieur
thanks
for
she
was
thinking
of
pascal
and
she
had
feared
he
might
shrink
from
her
when
she
fully
revealed
to
him
her
wretched
sorrowful
past
of
which
he
was
entirely
ignorant
but
the
magistrate
s
words
had
reassured
her
xi
the
clock
on
the
struck
four
the
magistrate
and
mademoiselle
marguerite
could
hear
stealthy
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
a
rustling
near
the
door
the
servants
were
prowling
round
about
the
study
wondering
what
was
the
reason
of
this
prolonged
conference
i
must
see
how
the
clerk
is
progressing
with
the
said
the
magistrate
excuse
me
if
i
absent
myself
for
a
moment
i
will
soon
and
so
saying
he
rose
and
left
the
room
but
it
was
only
a
pretext
he
really
wished
to
conceal
his
emotion
and
regain
his
composure
for
he
had
been
deeply
affected
by
the
young
girl
s
narrative
he
also
needed
time
for
reflection
for
the
situation
had
become
extremely
complicated
since
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
informed
him
of
the
existence
of
heirs
of
those
mysterious
enemies
who
had
poisoned
the
count
s
peace
these
persons
would
of
course
require
to
know
what
had
become
of
the
millions
deposited
in
the
escritoire
and
who
would
be
held
accountable
for
the
missing
treasure
mademoiselle
marguerite
unquestionably
such
were
the
thoughts
that
flitted
through
the
magistrate
s
mind
as
he
listened
to
his
clerk
s
report
nor
was
this
all
for
having
solicited
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
confidence
he
must
now
advise
her
and
this
was
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
however
when
he
returned
to
the
study
he
was
quite
and
impassive
again
and
he
was
pleased
to
see
that
on
her
side
the
unfortunate
girl
had
to
some
extent
at
least
recovered
her
wonted
composure
let
us
now
discuss
the
situation
calmly
he
began
i
shall
convince
you
that
your
prospects
are
not
so
frightful
as
you
imagine
but
before
speaking
of
the
future
will
you
allow
me
to
refer
to
the
past
the
girl
bowed
her
consent
let
us
first
of
all
consider
the
subject
of
the
missing
millions
they
were
certainly
in
the
escritoire
when
de
chalusse
replaced
the
vial
but
now
they
are
not
to
be
found
so
that
the
count
must
have
taken
them
away
with
that
thought
occurred
to
me
did
the
treasure
form
a
large
package
yes
it
was
large
but
it
could
have
been
easily
concealed
under
the
cloak
which
de
chalusse
very
good
what
was
the
time
when
he
left
the
house
about
five
o
when
was
he
brought
back
at
about
where
did
the
cabman
pick
him
up
near
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
lorette
so
he
told
do
you
know
the
driver
s
number
casimir
asked
him
for
it
i
had
any
one
inquired
the
reason
of
this
examination
the
magistrate
would
have
replied
that
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
interests
alone
influenced
him
in
the
course
he
was
taking
this
was
quite
true
and
yet
without
being
altogether
conscious
of
the
fact
he
was
also
impelled
by
another
motive
this
affair
interested
almost
fascinated
him
on
account
of
its
mysterious
surroundings
and
influenced
by
the
desire
for
arriving
at
the
truth
which
is
inherent
in
every
human
heart
he
was
anxious
to
solve
the
riddle
after
a
few
moments
thoughtful
silence
he
remarked
so
the
point
of
departure
in
our
investigation
if
there
is
an
investigation
will
be
this
de
chalusse
left
the
house
with
two
millions
in
his
possession
and
while
he
was
absent
he
either
disposed
of
that
enormous
sum
or
else
it
was
stolen
from
mademoiselle
marguerite
shuddered
oh
stolen
she
faltered
yes
my
child
anything
is
possible
we
must
consider
the
situation
in
every
possible
light
but
to
continue
where
was
de
chalusse
going
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
who
would
he
thought
be
able
to
furnish
the
address
given
in
the
letter
he
had
torn
what
was
this
gentleman
s
name
the
magistrate
wrote
the
name
down
on
his
tablets
and
then
resuming
his
examination
he
said
now
in
reference
to
this
unfortunate
letter
which
in
your
opinion
was
the
cause
of
the
count
s
death
what
did
it
say
i
don
t
know
monsieur
it
is
true
that
i
helped
the
count
in
collecting
the
fragments
but
i
did
not
read
what
was
written
on
that
is
of
little
account
the
main
thing
is
to
ascertain
who
wrote
the
letter
you
told
me
that
it
could
only
have
come
from
the
sister
who
disappeared
thirty
years
ago
or
else
from
your
that
was
and
still
is
my
the
magistrate
toyed
with
his
ring
and
a
smile
of
satisfaction
stole
over
his
face
very
well
he
exclaimed
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
whether
the
letter
was
from
your
mother
or
not
my
method
is
perfectly
simple
i
have
only
to
compare
the
handwriting
with
that
of
the
letters
found
in
the
mademoiselle
marguerite
sprang
up
exclaiming
what
a
happy
idea
but
without
seeming
to
notice
the
girl
s
surprise
he
added
where
are
the
remnants
of
this
letter
which
you
and
the
count
picked
up
in
the
garden
m
de
chalusse
placed
them
in
his
they
must
be
found
tell
the
count
s
valet
to
look
for
the
girl
rang
but
casimir
who
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
in
making
preparations
for
the
funeral
was
not
in
the
house
however
another
servant
and
madame
leon
offered
their
services
and
certainly
displayed
the
most
laudable
zeal
but
their
search
was
fruitless
the
fragments
of
the
letter
could
not
be
found
how
unfortunate
muttered
the
magistrate
as
he
watched
them
turn
the
pockets
of
the
count
s
clothes
inside
out
what
a
fatality
that
letter
would
probably
have
solved
the
compelled
to
submit
to
this
disappointment
he
returned
to
the
study
but
he
was
evidently
discouraged
although
he
did
not
consider
the
mystery
insoluble
far
from
it
he
realized
that
time
and
research
would
be
required
to
arrive
at
a
solution
and
that
the
affair
was
quite
beyond
his
province
one
hope
alone
remained
by
carefully
studying
the
last
words
which
de
chalusse
had
written
and
spoken
he
might
arrive
at
the
intention
which
had
dictated
them
experience
had
wonderfully
sharpened
his
penetration
and
perhaps
he
might
discover
a
hidden
meaning
which
would
throw
light
upon
all
this
doubt
and
uncertainty
accordingly
he
asked
mademoiselle
marguerite
for
the
paper
upon
which
the
count
had
endeavored
to
pen
his
last
wishes
and
in
addition
he
requested
her
to
write
on
a
card
the
dying
man
s
last
words
in
the
order
they
had
been
uttered
but
on
combining
the
written
and
the
spoken
words
the
only
result
obtained
was
as
follows
my
entire
fortune
give
friends
against
marguerite
despoiled
your
mother
take
these
twelve
incoherent
words
revealed
the
count
s
absorbing
and
poignant
anxiety
concerning
his
fortune
and
marguerite
s
future
and
also
the
fear
and
aversion
with
which
marguerite
s
mother
inspired
him
but
that
was
all
the
sense
was
not
precise
enough
for
any
practical
purpose
certainly
the
word
give
needed
no
explanation
it
was
plain
that
the
count
had
endeavored
to
write
i
give
my
entire
the
meaning
of
the
word
despoiled
was
also
clear
it
had
evidently
been
wrung
from
the
man
by
the
horrible
thought
that
marguerite
his
own
daughter
unquestionably
would
not
have
a
penny
of
all
the
millions
he
had
intended
for
her
take
care
also
explained
itself
but
there
were
two
words
which
seemed
absolutely
incomprehensible
to
the
magistrate
and
which
he
vainly
strove
to
connect
with
the
others
in
an
intelligible
manner
these
were
the
words
friends
and
against
and
they
were
the
most
legibly
written
of
all
for
the
thirtieth
time
the
magistrate
was
repeating
them
in
an
undertone
when
a
rap
came
at
the
door
and
almost
immediately
madame
leon
entered
the
room
what
is
it
inquired
mademoiselle
marguerite
laying
a
package
of
letters
addressed
to
de
chalusse
on
the
desk
the
housekeeper
replied
these
have
just
come
by
the
post
for
the
poor
count
heaven
rest
his
soul
and
then
handing
a
newspaper
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
she
added
in
an
unctuous
tone
and
some
one
left
this
paper
for
mademoiselle
at
the
same
this
paper
for
me
you
must
be
not
at
all
i
was
in
the
concierge
s
lodge
when
the
messenger
brought
it
and
he
said
it
was
for
mademoiselle
marguerite
from
one
of
her
and
with
these
words
she
made
one
of
her
very
best
courtesies
and
withdrew
the
girl
had
taken
the
newspaper
and
now
with
an
air
of
astonishment
and
apprehension
she
slowly
unfolded
it
what
first
attracted
her
attention
was
a
paragraph
on
the
first
page
marked
round
with
red
chalk
the
paper
had
evidently
been
sent
in
order
that
she
might
read
this
particular
passage
and
accordingly
she
began
to
peruse
it
there
was
a
great
sensation
and
a
terrible
scandal
last
evening
at
the
residence
of
madame
d
a
a
well
known
star
of
the
first
magnitude
it
was
the
shameful
article
which
described
the
events
that
had
robbed
pascal
of
his
honor
and
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
to
prevent
the
least
mistake
concerning
the
printed
initials
the
coward
who
sent
the
paper
had
appended
the
names
of
the
persons
mixed
up
in
the
affair
at
full
length
in
pencil
he
had
written
d
argeles
pascal
ferailleur
ferdinand
de
coralth
rochecote
and
yet
in
spite
of
these
precautions
the
girl
did
not
at
first
seize
the
full
meaning
of
the
article
and
she
was
obliged
to
read
it
over
again
but
when
she
finally
understood
it
when
the
horrible
truth
burst
upon
her
the
paper
fell
from
her
nerveless
hands
she
turned
as
pale
as
death
and
gasping
for
breath
leaned
heavily
against
the
wall
for
support
her
features
expressed
such
terrible
suffering
that
the
magistrate
sprang
from
his
chair
with
a
bound
what
has
happened
he
eagerly
asked
she
tried
to
reply
but
finding
herself
unable
to
do
so
she
pointed
to
the
paper
lying
upon
the
floor
and
gasped
there
there
the
magistrate
understood
everything
at
the
first
glance
and
this
man
who
had
witnessed
so
much
misery
who
had
been
the
confidant
of
so
many
martyrs
was
filled
with
consternation
at
thought
of
the
misfortunes
which
destiny
was
heaping
upon
this
defenceless
girl
he
approached
her
and
led
her
gently
to
an
upon
which
she
sank
half
fainting
poor
child
he
murmured
the
man
you
had
chosen
the
man
whom
you
would
have
sacrificed
everything
for
is
pascal
ferailleur
is
he
not
yes
it
is
he
is
an
advocate
as
i
have
already
told
you
does
he
live
in
the
rue
d
ulm
the
magistrate
shook
his
head
sadly
it
is
the
same
said
he
i
also
know
him
my
poor
child
and
i
loved
and
honored
him
yesterday
i
should
have
told
you
that
he
was
worthy
of
you
he
was
above
slander
but
now
see
what
depths
love
of
play
has
brought
him
to
he
is
a
thief
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
weakness
vanished
she
sprang
from
her
chair
and
indignantly
faced
the
magistrate
it
is
false
she
cried
vehemently
and
what
that
paper
says
is
false
as
well
had
her
reason
been
affected
by
so
many
successive
blows
it
seemed
likely
for
livid
a
moment
before
her
face
had
now
turned
scarlet
she
trembled
nervously
from
head
to
foot
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
insanity
in
her
big
black
eyes
if
she
doesn
t
weep
she
is
lost
thought
the
magistrate
and
instead
of
encouraging
her
to
hope
he
deemed
it
best
to
try
and
destroy
what
he
considered
a
dangerous
illusion
alas
my
poor
child
he
said
sadly
you
must
not
deceive
yourself
the
newspapers
are
often
hasty
in
their
judgment
but
an
article
like
that
is
only
published
when
proof
of
its
truth
is
furnished
by
witnesses
of
unimpeachable
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
she
were
listening
to
some
monstrous
absurdities
and
then
thoughtfully
muttered
ah
now
pascal
s
silence
is
explained
now
i
understand
why
he
has
not
yet
replied
to
the
letter
i
wrote
him
last
the
magistrate
persevered
however
and
added
so
after
the
article
you
have
just
read
no
one
can
entertain
the
shadow
of
a
mademoiselle
marguerite
hastily
interrupted
him
but
i
have
not
doubted
him
for
a
second
she
exclaimed
doubt
pascal
i
doubt
pascal
i
would
sooner
doubt
myself
i
might
commit
a
dishonorable
act
i
am
only
a
poor
weak
ignorant
girl
while
he
he
you
don
t
know
then
that
he
was
my
conscience
before
undertaking
anything
before
deciding
upon
anything
if
ever
i
felt
any
doubt
i
asked
myself
what
would
he
do
and
the
mere
thought
of
him
is
sufficient
to
banish
any
unworthy
idea
from
my
her
tone
and
manner
betokened
complete
and
unwavering
confidence
and
her
faith
imparted
an
almost
sublime
expression
to
her
face
if
i
was
overcome
monsieur
she
continued
it
was
only
because
i
was
appalled
by
the
audacity
of
the
accusation
how
was
it
possible
to
make
pascal
even
seem
to
be
guilty
of
a
dishonorable
act
this
is
beyond
my
powers
of
comprehension
i
am
only
certain
of
one
thing
that
he
is
innocent
if
the
whole
world
rose
to
testify
against
him
it
would
not
shake
my
faith
in
him
and
even
if
he
confessed
that
he
was
guilty
i
should
be
more
likely
to
believe
that
he
was
crazed
than
culpable
a
bitter
smile
curved
her
lips
she
was
beginning
to
judge
the
situation
more
correctly
and
in
a
calmer
tone
she
resumed
moreover
what
does
circumstantial
evidence
prove
did
you
not
this
morning
hear
all
our
servants
declaring
that
i
was
accountable
for
de
chalusse
s
millions
who
knows
what
might
have
happened
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
intervention
perhaps
by
this
time
i
should
have
been
in
this
is
not
a
parallel
case
my
it
is
a
parallel
case
monsieur
suppose
for
one
moment
that
i
had
been
formally
accused
what
do
you
think
pascal
would
have
replied
if
people
had
gone
to
him
and
said
marguerite
is
a
thief
he
would
have
laughed
them
to
scorn
and
have
exclaimed
impossible
the
magistrate
s
mind
was
made
up
in
his
opinion
pascal
ferailleur
was
guilty
still
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
the
girl
for
he
felt
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
convince
her
however
he
determined
if
possible
to
ascertain
her
plans
in
order
to
oppose
them
if
they
seemed
to
him
at
all
dangerous
perhaps
you
are
right
my
child
he
conceded
still
this
unfortunate
affair
must
change
all
your
rather
it
modifies
surprised
by
her
calmness
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
an
hour
ago
she
added
i
had
resolved
to
go
to
pascal
and
claim
his
aid
and
protection
as
one
claims
an
undeniable
right
or
the
fulfilment
of
a
solemn
promise
but
now
well
eagerly
asked
the
magistrate
i
am
still
resolved
to
go
to
him
but
as
an
humble
suppliant
and
i
shall
say
to
him
you
are
suffering
but
no
sorrow
is
intolerable
when
there
are
two
to
bear
the
burden
and
so
here
i
am
everything
else
may
fail
you
your
dearest
friends
may
basely
desert
you
but
here
am
i
whatever
your
plans
may
be
whether
you
have
decided
to
leave
europe
or
to
remain
in
paris
to
watch
for
your
hour
of
vengeance
you
will
need
a
faithful
trusty
companion
a
confidant
and
here
i
am
wife
friend
sister
i
will
be
which
ever
you
desire
i
am
yours
yours
and
as
if
in
reply
to
a
gesture
of
surprise
which
escaped
the
magistrate
she
added
he
is
unhappy
i
am
free
i
love
him
the
magistrate
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
he
knew
that
she
would
surely
do
what
she
said
he
had
realized
that
she
was
one
of
those
generous
heroic
women
who
are
capable
of
any
sacrifice
for
the
man
they
love
a
woman
who
would
never
shrink
from
what
she
considered
to
be
her
duty
who
was
utterly
incapable
of
weak
hesitancy
or
selfish
calculation
fortunately
my
dear
young
lady
your
devotion
will
no
doubt
be
useless
he
said
at
last
and
why
because
ferailleur
owes
it
to
you
and
what
is
more
he
owes
it
to
himself
not
to
accept
such
a
failing
to
understand
his
meaning
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
you
will
forgive
me
i
trust
he
continued
if
i
warn
you
to
prepare
for
a
disappointment
innocent
or
guilty
ferailleur
is
disgraced
unless
something
little
short
of
a
miracle
comes
to
help
him
his
career
is
ended
this
is
one
of
those
charges
one
of
those
slanders
if
you
prefer
that
term
which
a
man
can
never
shake
off
so
how
can
you
hope
that
he
will
consent
to
link
your
destiny
to
his
she
had
not
thought
of
this
objection
and
it
seemed
to
her
a
terrible
one
tears
came
to
her
dark
eyes
and
in
a
despondent
voice
she
murmured
god
grant
that
he
will
not
evince
such
cruel
generosity
the
only
great
and
true
misfortune
that
could
strike
me
now
would
be
to
have
him
repel
me
de
chalusse
s
death
leaves
me
without
means
without
bread
but
now
i
can
almost
bless
my
poverty
since
it
enables
me
to
ask
him
what
would
become
of
me
if
he
abandoned
me
and
who
would
protect
me
if
he
refused
to
do
so
the
brilliant
career
he
dreamed
of
is
ended
you
say
ah
well
i
will
console
him
and
though
we
are
unfortunate
we
may
yet
be
happy
our
enemies
are
triumphant
so
be
it
we
should
only
tarnish
our
honor
by
stooping
to
contend
against
such
villainy
but
in
some
new
land
in
america
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
find
some
quiet
spot
where
we
can
begin
a
new
and
better
it
was
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
it
was
mademoiselle
marguerite
usually
so
haughtily
reserved
who
was
now
speaking
with
such
passionate
vehemence
and
to
whom
was
she
talking
in
this
fashion
to
a
stranger
whom
she
saw
for
the
first
time
but
she
was
urged
on
by
circumstances
the
influence
of
which
was
stronger
than
her
own
will
they
had
led
her
to
reveal
her
dearest
and
most
sacred
feelings
and
to
display
her
real
nature
free
from
any
kind
of
disguise
however
the
magistrate
concealed
the
emotion
and
sympathy
which
filled
his
heart
and
refused
to
admit
that
the
girl
s
hopes
were
likely
to
be
realized
and
if
ferailleur
refused
to
accept
your
sacrifice
he
asked
it
is
not
a
sacrifice
no
matter
but
supposing
he
refused
it
what
should
you
do
what
should
i
do
she
muttered
i
don
t
know
still
i
should
have
no
difficulty
in
earning
a
livelihood
i
have
been
told
that
i
have
a
remarkable
voice
i
might
perhaps
go
upon
the
the
magistrate
sprang
from
his
you
become
an
actress
you
under
such
circumstances
it
would
little
matter
what
became
of
me
but
you
don
t
suspect
you
can
not
imagine
he
was
at
a
loss
for
words
to
explain
the
nature
of
his
objections
to
such
a
career
and
it
was
mademoiselle
marguerite
who
found
them
for
him
i
suspect
that
theatrical
life
is
an
abominable
life
for
a
woman
she
said
gravely
but
i
know
that
there
are
many
noble
and
chaste
women
who
have
adopted
the
profession
that
is
enough
for
me
my
pride
is
a
sufficient
protection
it
preserved
me
as
an
apprentice
it
would
preserve
me
as
an
actress
i
might
be
slandered
but
that
is
not
an
irremediable
misfortune
i
despise
the
world
too
much
to
be
troubled
by
its
opinion
so
long
as
i
have
the
approval
of
my
own
conscience
and
why
should
i
not
become
a
great
artiste
if
i
consecrated
all
the
intelligence
passion
energy
and
will
i
might
possess
to
my
art
hearing
a
knock
at
the
door
she
paused
and
a
moment
later
a
footman
entered
with
lights
for
night
was
falling
he
was
closely
followed
by
another
servant
who
said
mademoiselle
the
marquis
de
valorsay
is
below
and
wishes
to
know
if
mademoiselle
will
grant
him
the
honor
of
an
xii
on
hearing
de
valorsay
s
name
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
the
magistrate
exchanged
glances
full
of
wondering
conjecture
the
girl
was
undecided
what
course
to
pursue
but
the
magistrate
put
an
end
to
her
perplexity
ask
the
marquis
to
come
up
he
said
to
the
servant
the
footman
left
the
room
and
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
mademoiselle
marguerite
exclaimed
what
monsieur
after
all
i
have
told
you
you
still
wish
me
to
receive
him
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
do
so
you
must
know
what
he
wishes
and
what
hope
brings
him
here
calm
yourself
and
submit
to
in
a
sort
of
bewilderment
the
girl
hastily
arranged
her
disordered
dress
and
caught
up
her
wavy
hair
which
had
fallen
over
her
shoulders
ah
monsieur
she
remarked
don
t
you
understand
that
he
still
believes
me
to
be
the
count
s
heiress
in
his
eyes
i
am
still
surrounded
by
the
glamor
of
the
millions
which
are
mine
no
hush
here
he
comes
the
marquis
de
valorsay
was
indeed
upon
the
threshold
and
a
moment
later
he
entered
the
room
he
was
clad
with
the
exquisite
taste
of
those
intelligent
gentlemen
to
whom
the
color
of
a
pair
of
trousers
is
a
momentous
matter
and
whose
ambition
is
satisfied
if
they
are
regarded
as
a
sovereign
authority
respecting
the
cut
of
a
waistcoat
as
a
rule
his
expression
of
face
merely
denoted
supreme
contentment
with
himself
and
indifference
as
to
others
but
now
strange
to
say
he
looked
grave
and
almost
solemn
his
right
leg
the
unfortunate
limb
which
had
been
broken
when
he
fell
from
his
horse
in
ireland
seemed
stiff
and
dragged
a
trifle
more
than
usual
but
this
was
probably
solely
due
to
the
influence
of
the
atmosphere
he
bowed
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
with
every
mark
of
profound
respect
and
without
seeming
to
notice
the
magistrate
s
presence
you
will
excuse
me
i
trust
mademoiselle
said
he
in
having
insisted
upon
seeing
you
so
that
i
might
express
my
deep
sympathy
i
have
just
heard
of
the
terrible
misfortune
which
has
befallen
you
the
sudden
death
of
your
she
drew
back
as
if
she
were
terrified
and
repeated
my
father
the
marquis
did
not
evince
the
slightest
surprise
i
know
said
he
in
a
voice
which
he
tried
to
make
as
feeling
as
possible
i
know
that
de
chalusse
kept
this
fact
concealed
from
you
but
he
confided
his
secret
to
to
you
interrupted
the
magistrate
who
was
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
the
marquis
turned
haughtily
to
this
old
man
dressed
in
black
and
in
the
dry
tone
one
uses
in
speaking
to
an
indiscreet
inferior
he
replied
to
me
yes
monsieur
and
he
acquainted
me
not
only
by
word
of
mouth
but
in
writing
also
with
the
motives
which
influenced
him
expressing
his
fixed
intention
not
only
of
recognizing
mademoiselle
marguerite
as
his
daughter
but
also
of
adopting
her
in
order
to
insure
her
undisputed
right
to
his
fortune
and
his
ah
said
the
magistrate
as
if
suddenly
enlightened
ah
ah
but
without
noticing
this
exclamation
which
was
at
least
remarkable
in
tone
de
valorsay
again
turned
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
continued
your
ignorance
on
this
subject
mademoiselle
convinces
me
that
your
servants
have
not
deceived
me
in
telling
me
that
de
chalusse
was
struck
down
without
the
slightest
warning
but
they
have
told
me
one
thing
which
i
can
not
believe
they
have
told
me
that
the
count
made
no
provision
for
you
that
he
left
no
will
and
that
excuse
a
liberty
which
is
prompted
only
by
the
most
respectful
interest
and
that
the
result
of
this
incomprehensible
and
culpable
neglect
is
that
you
are
ruined
and
almost
without
means
can
this
be
possible
it
is
the
exact
truth
monsieur
replied
mademoiselle
marguerite
i
am
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
working
for
my
daily
she
spoke
these
words
with
a
sort
of
satisfaction
expecting
that
the
marquis
would
betray
his
disappointed
covetousness
by
some
significant
gesture
or
exclamation
and
she
was
already
prepared
to
rejoice
at
his
confusion
but
her
expectations
were
not
realized
instead
of
evincing
the
slightest
dismay
or
even
regret
de
valorsay
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
a
great
burden
had
been
lifted
from
his
heart
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
apparent
delight
then
i
may
venture
to
speak
he
exclaimed
with
unconcealed
satisfaction
i
will
speak
mademoiselle
if
you
will
deign
to
allow
she
looked
at
him
with
anxious
curiosity
wondering
what
was
to
come
speak
monsieur
she
faltered
i
will
obey
you
mademoiselle
he
said
bowing
again
but
first
allow
me
to
tell
you
how
great
my
hopes
have
been
de
chalusse
s
death
is
an
irreparable
misfortune
for
me
as
for
yourself
he
had
allowed
me
mademoiselle
to
aspire
to
the
honor
of
becoming
a
suitor
for
your
hand
if
he
did
not
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
it
was
only
because
he
wished
to
leave
you
absolutely
free
and
impose
upon
me
the
difficult
task
of
winning
your
consent
but
between
him
and
me
everything
had
been
arranged
in
principle
and
he
was
to
give
a
dowry
of
three
millions
of
francs
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
de
chalusse
his
i
am
no
longer
mademoiselle
de
chalusse
monsieur
le
marquis
and
i
am
no
longer
the
possessor
of
a
he
felt
the
sharp
sting
of
this
retort
for
the
blood
rose
to
his
cheeks
still
he
did
not
lose
his
composure
if
you
were
still
rich
mademoiselle
he
replied
in
the
reproachful
tone
of
an
honest
man
who
feels
that
he
is
misunderstood
i
should
perhaps
have
strength
to
keep
the
sentiments
with
which
you
have
inspired
me
a
secret
in
my
own
heart
but
he
rose
and
with
a
gesture
which
was
not
devoid
of
grace
and
in
a
full
ringing
voice
he
added
but
you
are
no
longer
the
possessor
of
millions
and
so
i
may
tell
you
mademoiselle
marguerite
that
i
love
you
will
you
be
my
wife
the
poor
girl
was
obliged
to
exercise
all
her
powers
of
to
restrain
an
exclamation
of
dismay
it
was
indeed
more
than
dismay
she
was
absolutely
terrified
by
the
marquis
de
valorsay
s
unexpected
declaration
and
she
could
only
falter
monsieur
monsieur
but
with
an
air
of
winning
frankness
he
continued
need
i
tell
you
who
i
am
mademoiselle
no
that
is
unnecessary
the
fact
that
my
suit
was
approved
of
by
de
chalusse
is
the
best
recommendation
i
can
offer
you
the
pure
and
stainless
name
i
bear
is
one
of
the
proudest
in
france
and
though
my
fortune
may
have
been
somewhat
impaired
by
youthful
folly
it
is
still
more
than
sufficient
to
maintain
an
establishment
in
keeping
with
my
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
still
powerless
to
reply
her
presence
of
mind
had
entirely
deserted
her
and
her
tongue
seemed
to
cleave
to
her
palate
she
glanced
entreatingly
at
the
old
magistrate
as
if
imploring
his
intervention
but
he
was
so
absorbed
in
contemplating
his
wonderful
ring
that
one
might
have
imagined
he
was
oblivious
of
all
that
was
going
on
around
him
i
am
aware
that
i
have
so
far
not
been
fortunate
enough
to
please
you
mademoiselle
continued
the
marquis
m
de
chalusse
did
not
conceal
it
from
me
i
remember
alas
that
i
advocated
in
your
presence
a
number
of
stupid
theories
which
must
have
given
you
a
very
poor
opinion
of
me
but
you
will
forgive
me
i
trust
my
ideas
have
entirely
changed
since
i
have
learned
to
understand
and
appreciate
your
vigorous
intellect
and
nobility
of
soul
i
thoughtlessly
spoke
to
you
in
the
language
which
is
usually
addressed
to
young
ladies
of
our
rank
of
life
frivolous
beauties
who
are
spoiled
by
vanity
and
luxury
and
who
look
upon
marriage
only
as
a
means
of
his
words
were
disjointed
as
if
emotion
choked
his
utterance
at
times
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
scarcely
command
his
feelings
and
then
his
voice
became
so
faint
and
trembling
that
it
was
scarcely
intelligible
however
by
allowing
him
to
continue
by
listening
to
what
he
said
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
encouraging
him
even
more
virtually
binding
herself
she
understood
that
this
was
the
case
and
making
a
powerful
effort
she
interrupted
him
saying
i
assure
you
monsieur
le
marquis
that
i
am
deeply
touched
and
grateful
but
i
am
no
longer
pray
mademoiselle
pray
do
not
reply
grant
me
a
little
time
to
overcome
your
she
shook
her
head
and
in
a
firmer
voice
replied
i
have
no
prejudices
but
for
some
time
past
already
my
future
has
been
decided
irrevocably
he
seemed
thunderstruck
and
his
manner
apparently
indicated
that
the
possibility
of
a
repulse
had
never
entered
his
mind
his
eyes
wandered
restlessly
from
mademoiselle
marguerite
to
the
countenance
of
the
old
magistrate
who
remained
as
impassive
as
a
sphinx
and
at
last
they
lighted
on
a
newspaper
which
was
lying
on
the
floor
at
the
young
girl
s
feet
do
not
deprive
me
of
all
hope
he
murmured
she
made
no
answer
and
understanding
her
silence
he
was
about
to
retire
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
a
servant
announced
monsieur
de
mademoiselle
marguerite
touched
the
magistrate
on
the
shoulder
to
attract
his
attention
this
gentleman
is
de
chalusse
s
friend
whom
i
sent
for
this
at
the
same
moment
a
man
who
looked
some
sixty
years
of
age
entered
the
room
he
was
very
tall
and
as
straight
as
the
letter
i
being
arrayed
in
a
long
blue
while
his
neck
which
was
as
red
and
as
wrinkled
as
that
of
a
was
encased
in
a
very
high
and
stiff
satin
cravat
on
seeing
his
ruddy
face
his
closely
cropped
hair
his
little
eyes
twinkling
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
his
formidable
mustaches
a
la
victor
emmanuel
you
would
have
immediately
exclaimed
that
man
is
an
old
soldier
a
great
mistake
de
fondege
had
never
been
in
the
service
and
it
was
only
in
mockery
of
his
somewhat
bellicose
manners
and
appearance
that
some
twenty
years
previously
his
friends
had
dubbed
him
the
however
the
appellation
had
clung
to
him
the
nickname
had
been
changed
to
a
title
and
now
de
fondege
was
known
as
the
general
everywhere
he
was
invited
and
announced
as
the
many
people
believed
that
he
had
really
been
one
and
perhaps
he
fancied
so
himself
for
he
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
inscribing
general
de
fondege
on
his
visiting
cards
the
nickname
had
had
a
decisive
influence
on
his
life
he
had
endeavored
to
show
himself
worthy
of
it
and
the
manners
he
had
at
first
assumed
eventually
became
natural
ones
he
seemed
to
be
the
conventional
old
soldier
irascible
and
jovial
at
the
same
time
brusk
and
kind
at
once
frank
sensible
and
brutal
as
simple
as
a
child
and
yet
as
true
as
steel
he
swore
the
most
tremendous
oaths
in
a
deep
bass
voice
and
whenever
he
talked
his
arms
revolved
like
the
sails
of
a
windmill
however
madame
de
fondege
who
was
a
very
angular
lady
with
a
sharp
nose
and
very
thin
lips
assured
people
that
her
husband
was
not
so
terrible
as
he
appeared
he
was
not
considered
very
shrewd
and
he
pretended
to
have
an
intense
dislike
for
business
matters
no
one
knew
anything
precise
about
his
fortune
but
he
had
a
great
many
friends
who
invited
him
to
dinner
and
they
all
declared
that
he
was
in
very
comfortable
circumstances
on
entering
the
study
this
worthy
man
did
not
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
the
marquis
de
valorsay
although
they
were
intimate
friends
he
walked
straight
up
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
caught
her
in
his
long
arms
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
brushing
her
face
with
his
huge
mustaches
as
he
pretended
to
kiss
her
courage
my
dear
he
growled
courage
don
t
give
way
follow
my
example
look
at
me
so
saying
he
stepped
back
and
it
was
really
amusing
to
see
the
extraordinary
effort
he
made
to
combine
a
soldier
s
stoicism
with
a
friend
s
sorrow
you
must
wonder
at
my
delay
my
dear
he
resumed
but
it
was
not
my
fault
i
was
at
madame
de
rochecote
s
when
i
was
informed
that
your
messenger
was
at
home
waiting
for
me
i
returned
and
heard
the
frightful
news
it
was
a
thunderbolt
a
friend
of
thirty
years
standing
a
thousand
thunderclaps
i
acted
as
his
second
when
he
fought
his
first
duel
poor
chalusse
a
man
as
sturdy
as
an
oak
and
who
ought
to
have
outlived
us
all
but
it
is
always
so
the
best
soldiers
always
file
by
first
at
the
marquis
de
valorsay
had
beaten
a
retreat
the
magistrate
was
hidden
in
a
dark
corner
and
mademoiselle
marguerite
who
was
accustomed
to
the
general
s
manner
remained
silent
being
well
aware
that
there
was
no
chance
of
putting
in
a
word
as
long
as
he
had
possession
of
the
floor
fortunately
poor
chalusse
was
a
prudent
man
continued
de
fondege
he
loved
you
devotedly
my
dear
as
his
testamentary
provisions
must
have
shown
his
provisions
yes
most
certainly
surely
you
don
t
mean
to
try
and
conceal
anything
from
one
who
knows
all
ah
you
will
be
one
of
the
greatest
catches
in
europe
and
you
will
have
plenty
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
sadly
shook
her
head
you
are
mistaken
general
the
count
left
no
will
and
has
made
no
provision
whatever
for
de
fondege
trembled
turned
a
trifle
pale
and
in
a
faltering
voice
exclaimed
what
you
tell
me
that
chalusse
a
thousand
thunderclaps
it
isn
t
the
count
was
stricken
with
apoplexy
in
a
cab
he
went
out
about
five
o
clock
on
foot
and
a
little
before
seven
he
was
brought
home
unconscious
where
he
had
been
we
don
t
you
don
t
know
you
don
t
know
alas
no
and
he
was
only
able
to
utter
a
few
incoherent
words
before
he
thereupon
the
poor
girl
began
a
brief
account
of
what
had
taken
place
during
the
last
hours
had
she
been
less
absorbed
in
her
narrative
she
would
have
noticed
that
the
general
was
not
listening
to
her
he
was
sitting
at
the
count
s
desk
and
was
toying
with
the
letters
which
madame
leon
had
brought
into
the
room
a
short
time
previously
one
of
them
especially
seemed
to
attract
his
attention
to
exercise
a
sort
of
fascination
over
him
as
it
were
he
looked
at
it
with
hungry
eyes
and
whenever
he
touched
it
his
hand
trembled
or
involuntarily
clinched
his
face
moreover
had
become
livid
his
eyes
twitched
nervously
he
seemed
to
have
a
difficulty
in
breathing
and
big
drops
of
perspiration
trickled
down
his
forehead
if
the
magistrate
were
able
to
see
the
general
s
face
he
must
certainly
have
been
of
opinion
that
a
terrible
conflict
was
raging
in
his
mind
the
struggle
lasted
indeed
for
fully
five
minutes
and
then
suddenly
certain
that
no
one
saw
him
he
caught
up
the
letter
in
question
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
poor
marguerite
was
now
finishing
her
story
you
see
monsieur
that
far
from
being
an
heiress
as
you
suppose
i
am
homeless
and
penniless
she
said
the
general
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
striding
up
and
down
the
room
with
every
token
of
intense
agitation
it
s
true
he
said
apparently
unconscious
of
his
words
she
s
ruined
lost
the
misfortune
is
complete
then
suddenly
pausing
with
folded
arms
in
front
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
god
will
not
forsake
me
general
she
replied
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
resumed
his
promenade
wildly
gesticulating
and
indulging
in
a
furious
monologue
which
was
certainly
not
very
easy
to
follow
frightful
terrible
he
growled
the
daughter
of
an
old
comrade
zounds
of
a
friend
of
thirty
years
standing
to
be
left
in
such
a
plight
never
a
thousand
thunderclaps
never
poor
child
a
heart
of
gold
and
as
pretty
as
an
angel
this
horrible
paris
would
devour
her
at
a
single
mouthful
it
would
be
a
crime
an
abomination
it
sha
n
t
be
the
old
veterans
are
here
firm
as
rocks
thereupon
approaching
the
poor
girl
again
he
exclaimed
in
a
coarse
but
seemingly
feeling
voice
mademoiselle
general
you
are
acquainted
with
my
son
gustave
fondege
are
you
not
i
think
i
have
heard
you
speak
of
him
to
de
chalusse
several
the
general
tugged
furiously
at
his
mustaches
as
was
his
wont
whenever
he
was
perplexed
or
embarrassed
my
son
he
resumed
is
he
s
now
a
lieutenant
of
hussars
and
will
soon
be
promoted
to
the
rank
of
captain
he
s
a
handsome
fellow
sure
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
for
he
s
not
wanting
in
spirit
as
i
never
attempt
to
hide
the
truth
i
must
confess
that
he
s
a
trifle
dissipated
but
his
heart
is
all
right
and
a
charming
little
wife
would
soon
turn
him
from
the
error
of
his
ways
and
he
d
become
the
pearl
of
he
paused
passed
his
forefinger
three
or
four
times
between
his
collar
and
his
neck
and
then
in
a
voice
he
added
mademoiselle
marguerite
i
have
the
honor
to
ask
for
your
hand
in
marriage
on
behalf
of
lieutenant
gustave
de
fondege
my
there
was
a
dangerous
gleam
of
anger
in
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
eyes
as
she
coldly
replied
i
am
honored
by
your
request
monsieur
but
my
future
is
already
some
seconds
elapsed
before
de
fondege
could
recover
his
powers
of
speech
this
is
a
piece
of
foolishness
he
faltered
at
last
with
singular
agitation
let
me
hope
that
you
will
reconsider
the
matter
and
if
gustave
doesn
t
please
you
we
will
find
some
one
better
but
under
no
circumstances
will
chalusse
s
old
comrade
ever
desert
you
i
shall
send
madame
de
fondege
to
see
you
this
evening
she
s
a
good
woman
and
you
will
understand
each
other
come
answer
me
what
do
you
say
to
it
his
persistence
irritated
the
poor
girl
beyond
endurance
and
to
put
an
end
to
the
painful
scene
she
at
last
asked
would
you
not
like
to
look
for
the
last
time
at
de
chalusse
ah
yes
certainly
an
old
friend
of
thirty
years
so
saying
he
advanced
toward
the
door
leading
into
the
but
on
reaching
the
threshold
he
cried
in
sudden
terror
oh
no
no
i
could
and
with
these
words
he
withdrew
or
rather
he
fled
from
the
room
down
the
stairs
as
long
as
the
general
had
been
there
the
magistrate
had
given
no
sign
of
life
but
seated
beyond
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
lamps
he
had
remained
an
attentive
spectator
of
the
scene
and
now
that
he
found
himself
once
more
alone
with
mademoiselle
marguerite
he
came
forward
and
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
and
looking
her
full
in
the
face
he
exclaimed
well
my
child
the
girl
trembled
like
a
culprit
awaiting
sentence
of
death
and
it
was
in
a
hollow
voice
that
she
replied
i
understood
what
insisted
the
pitiless
magistrate
she
raised
her
beautiful
eyes
in
which
angry
tears
were
still
glittering
and
then
answered
in
a
voice
which
quivered
with
suppressed
passion
i
have
fathomed
the
infamy
of
those
two
men
who
have
just
left
the
house
i
understood
the
insult
their
apparent
generosity
conceals
they
had
questioned
the
servants
and
had
ascertained
that
two
millions
were
missing
ah
the
scoundrels
they
believe
that
i
have
stolen
those
millions
and
they
came
to
ask
me
to
share
the
wealth
with
them
what
an
insult
and
to
think
that
i
am
powerless
to
avenge
it
ah
the
servants
suspicions
were
nothing
in
comparison
with
this
at
least
they
did
not
ask
for
a
share
of
the
booty
as
the
price
of
their
silence
the
magistrate
shook
his
head
as
if
this
explanation
scarcely
satisfied
him
there
is
something
else
there
is
certainly
something
else
he
repeated
but
the
doors
were
still
open
so
he
closed
them
carefully
and
then
returned
to
the
girl
he
was
so
desirous
of
advising
i
wish
to
tell
you
he
said
that
you
have
mistaken
the
motives
which
induced
these
gentlemen
to
ask
for
your
hand
in
do
you
believe
then
that
you
have
fathomed
them
i
could
almost
swear
that
i
had
didn
t
you
remark
a
great
difference
in
their
manner
didn
t
one
of
them
the
marquis
behave
with
all
the
calmness
and
composure
which
are
the
result
of
reflection
and
calculation
the
other
on
the
contrary
acted
most
precipitately
as
if
he
had
suddenly
come
to
a
determination
and
formed
a
plan
on
the
impulse
of
the
mademoiselle
marguerite
reflected
that
s
true
she
said
that
s
indeed
true
now
i
recollect
the
and
this
is
my
explanation
of
it
resumed
the
magistrate
the
marquis
de
valorsay
i
said
to
myself
must
have
proofs
in
his
possession
that
mademoiselle
marguerite
is
the
count
s
daughter
written
and
conclusive
proofs
that
is
certain
probably
a
voluntary
admission
of
the
fact
from
the
father
who
can
prove
that
de
valorsay
does
not
possess
this
acknowledgment
in
fact
he
must
possess
it
he
hinted
it
accordingly
on
hearing
of
the
count
s
sudden
death
he
said
to
himself
if
marguerite
was
my
wife
and
if
i
could
prove
her
to
be
de
chalusse
s
daughter
i
should
obtain
several
whereupon
he
consulted
his
legal
adviser
who
assured
him
that
it
would
be
the
best
course
he
could
pursue
and
so
he
came
here
you
repulsed
him
but
he
will
soon
make
another
assault
you
may
rest
assured
of
that
and
some
day
or
other
he
will
come
to
you
and
say
whether
we
marry
or
not
let
us
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
amazed
the
magistrate
s
words
seemed
to
dispel
the
mist
which
had
hitherto
hidden
the
truth
from
view
yes
she
exclaimed
yes
you
are
right
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
he
resumed
i
understand
de
fondege
s
motive
less
clearly
but
still
i
have
some
clue
he
had
not
questioned
the
servants
that
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
on
his
arrival
here
he
believed
you
to
be
the
sole
legatee
he
was
also
aware
that
de
chalusse
had
taken
certain
precautions
we
are
ignorant
of
but
which
he
is
no
doubt
fully
acquainted
with
what
you
told
him
about
your
poverty
amazed
him
and
he
immediately
evinced
a
desire
to
atone
for
the
count
s
neglect
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
he
were
the
cause
of
this
negligence
himself
and
indeed
judging
by
the
agitation
he
displayed
when
he
was
imploring
you
to
become
his
son
s
wife
one
might
almost
imagine
that
the
sight
of
your
misery
awakened
a
remorse
which
he
was
endeavoring
to
quiet
now
draw
your
own
the
wretched
girl
looked
questioningly
at
the
magistrate
as
if
she
hesitated
to
trust
the
thoughts
which
his
words
had
awakened
in
her
mind
then
you
think
monsieur
she
said
with
evident
reluctance
you
think
you
suppose
that
the
general
is
acquainted
with
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
millions
quite
correct
answered
the
magistrate
and
then
as
if
he
feared
that
he
had
gone
too
far
he
added
but
draw
your
own
conclusions
respecting
the
matter
you
have
the
whole
night
before
you
we
will
talk
it
over
again
and
if
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
in
any
way
i
shall
be
only
too
but
monsieur
oh
i
must
go
to
dinner
now
besides
my
clerk
must
be
getting
terribly
the
clerk
was
indeed
out
of
temper
not
that
he
had
finished
taking
an
inventory
of
the
appurtenances
of
this
immense
house
but
because
he
considered
that
he
had
done
quite
enough
work
for
one
day
and
yet
his
discontent
was
sensibly
diminished
when
he
calculated
the
amount
he
would
receive
for
his
pains
during
the
nine
years
he
had
held
this
office
he
had
never
made
such
an
extensive
inventory
before
he
seemed
somewhat
dazzled
and
as
he
followed
his
superior
out
of
the
house
he
remarked
do
you
know
monsieur
that
as
nearly
as
i
can
discover
the
deceased
s
fortune
must
amount
to
more
than
twenty
millions
an
income
of
a
million
a
year
and
to
think
that
the
poor
young
lady
shouldn
t
have
a
penny
of
it
i
suspect
she
s
crying
her
eyes
but
the
clerk
was
mistaken
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
then
questioning
casimir
respecting
the
arrangements
which
he
had
made
for
the
funeral
and
when
this
sad
duty
was
concluded
she
consented
to
take
a
little
food
standing
in
front
of
the
sideboard
in
the
then
she
went
to
kneel
in
the
count
s
room
where
four
members
of
the
parochial
clergy
were
reciting
the
prayers
for
the
dead
she
was
so
exhausted
with
fatigue
that
she
could
scarcely
speak
and
her
eyelids
were
heavy
with
sleep
but
she
had
another
task
to
fulfil
a
task
which
she
deemed
a
sacred
duty
she
sent
a
servant
for
a
cab
threw
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
left
the
house
accompanied
by
madame
leon
the
cabman
drove
as
fast
as
possible
to
the
house
where
pascal
and
his
mother
resided
in
the
rue
d
ulm
but
on
arriving
there
the
front
door
was
found
to
be
closed
and
the
light
in
the
vestibule
was
extinguished
marguerite
was
obliged
to
ring
five
or
six
times
before
the
concierge
made
his
appearance
i
wish
to
see
monsieur
ferailleur
she
quietly
said
the
man
glanced
at
her
scornfully
and
then
replied
he
no
longer
lives
here
the
landlord
doesn
t
want
any
thieves
in
his
house
he
s
sold
his
rubbish
and
started
for
america
with
his
old
witch
of
a
so
saying
he
closed
the
door
again
and
marguerite
was
so
overwhelmed
by
this
last
and
unexpected
misfortune
that
she
could
hardly
stagger
back
to
the
vehicle
gone
she
murmured
gone
without
a
thought
of
me
or
does
he
believe
me
to
be
like
all
the
rest
but
i
will
find
him
again
that
man
fortunat
who
ascertained
addresses
for
de
chalusse
will
find
pascal
for
xiii
few
people
have
any
idea
of
the
great
number
of
estates
which
in
default
of
heirs
to
claim
them
annually
revert
to
the
government
the
treasury
derives
large
sums
from
this
source
every
year
and
this
is
easily
explained
for
nowadays
family
ties
are
becoming
less
and
less
binding
brothers
cease
to
meet
their
children
no
longer
know
each
other
and
the
members
of
the
second
generation
are
as
perfect
strangers
as
though
they
were
not
united
by
a
bond
of
consanguinity
the
young
man
whom
love
of
adventure
lures
to
a
country
and
the
young
girl
who
marries
against
her
parents
wishes
soon
cease
to
exist
for
their
relatives
no
one
even
inquires
what
has
become
of
them
those
who
remain
at
home
are
afraid
to
ask
whether
they
are
prosperous
or
unfortunate
lest
they
should
be
called
upon
to
assist
the
wanderers
forgotten
themselves
the
adventurers
in
their
turn
soon
forget
if
fortune
smiles
upon
them
they
are
careful
not
to
inform
their
relatives
poor
they
have
been
cast
off
wealthy
they
themselves
deny
their
kindred
having
become
rich
unaided
they
find
an
egotistical
satisfaction
in
spending
their
money
alone
in
accordance
with
their
own
fancies
now
when
a
man
of
this
class
dies
what
happens
the
servants
and
people
around
him
profit
of
his
loneliness
and
isolation
and
the
justice
of
the
peace
is
only
summoned
to
affix
the
seals
after
they
have
removed
all
the
portable
property
an
inventory
is
taken
and
after
a
few
formalities
as
no
heirs
present
themselves
the
court
declares
the
inheritance
to
be
in
abeyance
and
appoints
a
trustee
this
trustee
s
duties
are
very
simple
he
manages
the
property
and
remits
the
income
to
the
treasury
until
a
legal
judgment
declares
the
estate
the
property
of
the
country
regardless
of
any
heirs
who
may
present
themselves
in
future
if
i
only
had
a
twentieth
part
of
the
money
that
is
lost
in
this
way
my
fortune
would
be
made
exclaimed
a
shrewd
man
some
thirty
years
ago
the
person
who
spoke
was
antoine
vaudore
for
six
months
he
secretly
nursed
the
idea
studying
it
examining
it
in
all
respects
weighing
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
at
last
he
decided
that
it
was
a
good
one
that
same
year
indeed
assisted
by
a
little
capital
which
he
had
obtained
no
one
knew
how
he
created
a
new
strange
and
untried
profession
to
supply
a
new
demand
thus
vaudore
was
the
first
man
who
made
a
profession
as
will
be
generally
admitted
it
is
not
a
profession
that
can
be
successfully
followed
by
a
craven
it
requires
the
exercise
of
unusual
shrewdness
untiring
activity
extraordinary
energy
and
courage
as
well
as
great
tact
and
varied
knowledge
the
man
who
would
follow
it
successfully
must
possess
the
boldness
of
a
gambler
the
of
a
duelist
the
keen
perceptive
powers
and
patience
of
a
detective
and
the
resources
and
quick
wit
of
the
shrewdest
attorney
it
is
easier
to
decry
the
profession
than
to
exercise
it
to
begin
with
the
must
be
posted
up
with
information
respecting
unclaimed
inheritances
and
he
must
have
sufficient
acquaintance
with
the
legal
world
to
be
able
to
obtain
information
from
the
clerks
of
the
different
courts
notaries
and
so
on
when
he
learns
that
a
man
has
died
without
any
known
heirs
his
first
care
is
to
ascertain
the
amount
of
unclaimed
property
to
see
if
it
will
pay
him
to
take
up
the
case
if
he
finds
that
the
inheritance
is
a
valuable
one
he
begins
operations
without
delay
he
must
first
ascertain
the
deceased
s
full
name
and
age
it
is
easy
to
procure
this
information
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
discover
the
name
of
the
place
where
the
deceased
was
born
his
profession
what
countries
he
lived
in
his
tastes
and
mode
of
life
in
a
word
everything
that
constitutes
a
complete
biography
however
when
he
has
armed
himself
with
the
more
indispensable
facts
our
agent
opens
the
campaign
with
extreme
prudence
for
it
would
be
ruinous
to
awake
suspicion
it
is
curious
to
observe
the
incomparable
address
which
the
agent
displays
in
his
efforts
to
learn
the
particulars
of
the
deceased
s
life
by
consulting
his
friends
his
enemies
his
debtors
and
all
who
ever
knew
him
until
at
last
some
one
is
found
who
says
such
and
such
a
man
why
he
came
from
our
part
of
the
country
i
never
knew
him
but
i
am
acquainted
with
one
of
his
brothers
with
one
of
his
uncles
or
with
one
of
his
very
often
years
of
constant
research
a
large
outlay
of
money
and
costly
and
skilful
advertising
in
all
the
european
journals
are
necessary
before
this
result
is
reached
and
it
is
only
when
it
has
been
attained
that
the
agent
can
take
time
to
breathe
but
now
the
chances
are
greatly
in
his
favor
the
worst
is
over
the
portion
of
his
task
which
depended
on
chance
alone
is
concluded
the
rest
is
a
matter
of
skill
tact
and
shrewdness
the
detective
must
give
place
to
the
crafty
lawyer
the
agent
must
confer
with
this
heir
who
has
been
discovered
at
the
cost
of
so
much
time
and
trouble
and
induce
him
to
bestow
a
portion
of
this
prospective
wealth
on
the
person
who
is
able
to
establish
his
claim
there
must
be
an
agreement
in
writing
clearly
stating
what
proportion
a
tenth
a
third
or
a
half
the
agent
will
be
entitled
to
the
negotiation
is
a
very
delicate
and
difficult
one
requiring
prodigious
presence
of
mind
and
an
amount
of
duplicity
which
would
make
the
most
astute
diplomatist
turn
pale
with
envy
occasionally
the
heir
suspects
the
truth
sneers
at
the
proposition
and
hurries
off
to
claim
the
whole
of
the
inheritance
that
belongs
to
him
the
agent
may
then
bid
his
hopes
farewell
he
has
worked
and
spent
money
for
nothing
however
such
a
misfortune
is
of
rare
occurrence
on
hearing
of
the
unexpected
good
fortune
that
has
befallen
him
the
heir
is
generally
unsuspicious
and
willingly
promises
to
pay
the
amount
demanded
of
him
a
contract
is
drawn
up
and
signed
and
then
but
only
then
does
the
agent
take
his
client
into
his
confidence
you
are
the
relative
of
such
a
person
are
you
not
very
well
he
is
dead
and
you
are
his
heir
thank
providence
and
make
haste
to
claim
your
as
a
rule
the
heir
loyally
fulfils
his
obligation
but
sometimes
it
happens
that
when
he
has
obtained
undisputed
possession
of
the
property
he
declares
that
he
has
been
swindled
and
refuses
to
fulfil
his
part
of
the
contract
then
the
case
must
go
to
the
courts
it
is
true
however
that
the
judgment
of
the
tribunals
generally
recalls
the
refractory
client
to
a
sense
of
gratitude
and
humility
now
our
friend
isidore
fortunat
was
a
hunter
of
missing
heirs
undoubtedly
he
often
engaged
in
other
business
which
was
a
trifle
less
respectable
but
was
one
of
the
best
and
most
substantial
sources
of
his
income
so
we
can
readily
understand
why
he
so
quickly
left
off
lamenting
that
forty
thousand
francs
lent
to
the
marquis
de
valorsay
changing
his
tactics
he
said
to
himself
that
even
if
he
had
lost
this
amount
through
de
chalusse
s
sudden
death
it
was
much
less
than
he
might
obtain
if
he
succeeded
in
discovering
the
unknown
heirs
to
so
many
millions
and
he
had
some
reason
to
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
so
having
been
employed
by
de
chalusse
when
the
latter
was
seeking
mademoiselle
marguerite
fortunat
had
gained
some
valuable
information
respecting
his
client
and
the
additional
particulars
which
he
had
obtained
from
madame
vantrasson
elated
him
to
such
an
extent
that
more
than
once
he
exclaimed
ah
well
it
is
perhaps
a
blessing
in
disguise
after
still
isidore
fortunat
slept
but
little
after
his
stormy
interview
with
the
marquis
de
valorsay
a
loss
of
forty
thousand
francs
is
not
likely
to
impart
a
roseate
hue
to
one
s
dreams
and
fortunat
prized
his
money
as
if
it
had
been
the
very
marrow
of
his
bones
by
way
of
consolation
he
assured
himself
that
he
would
not
merely
regain
the
sum
but
triple
it
and
yet
this
encouragement
did
not
entirely
restore
his
peace
of
mind
the
gain
was
only
a
possibility
and
the
loss
was
a
certainty
so
he
twisted
and
turned
and
tossed
on
his
bed
as
if
it
had
been
a
hot
gridiron
exhausting
himself
in
surmises
and
preparing
his
mind
for
the
difficulties
which
he
would
be
obliged
to
overcome
his
plan
was
a
simple
one
but
its
execution
was
fraught
with
difficulties
i
must
discover
de
chalusse
s
sister
if
she
is
still
living
i
must
discover
her
children
if
she
is
dead
he
said
to
himself
it
was
easy
to
say
this
but
how
was
he
to
do
it
how
could
he
hope
to
find
this
unfortunate
girl
who
had
abandoned
her
home
thirty
years
previously
to
fly
no
one
knew
where
or
with
whom
how
was
he
to
gain
any
idea
of
the
life
she
had
lived
or
the
fate
that
had
befallen
her
at
what
point
on
the
social
scale
and
in
what
country
should
he
begin
his
investigations
these
daughters
of
noble
houses
who
desert
the
paternal
roof
in
a
moment
of
madness
generally
die
most
miserably
after
a
wretched
life
the
girl
of
the
lower
classes
is
armed
against
misfortune
and
has
been
trained
for
the
conflict
she
can
measure
and
calculate
the
force
of
her
fall
and
regulate
and
control
it
to
a
certain
extent
but
the
others
can
not
they
have
never
known
privation
and
hardship
and
are
therefore
defenceless
and
for
the
very
reason
that
they
have
been
hurled
from
a
great
height
they
often
fall
down
into
the
lowest
depths
of
infamy
if
morning
would
only
come
sighed
isidore
fortunat
as
he
tossed
restlessly
to
and
fro
as
soon
as
morning
comes
i
will
set
to
work
but
just
before
daybreak
he
fell
asleep
and
at
nine
o
clock
he
was
still
slumbering
so
soundly
that
madame
dodelin
his
housekeeper
had
considerable
difficulty
in
waking
him
your
clerks
have
come
she
exclaimed
shaking
him
vigorously
and
two
clients
are
waiting
for
you
in
the
he
sprang
up
hastily
dressed
himself
and
went
into
his
office
it
cost
him
no
little
effort
to
receive
his
visitors
that
morning
but
it
would
have
been
folly
to
neglect
all
his
other
business
for
the
uncertain
chalusse
affair
the
first
client
who
entered
was
a
man
still
young
of
common
even
vulgar
appearance
not
being
acquainted
with
fortunat
he
deemed
it
proper
to
introduce
himself
without
delay
my
name
is
leplaintre
and
i
am
a
coal
merchant
said
he
i
was
recommended
to
call
on
you
by
my
friend
bouscat
who
was
formerly
in
the
wine
fortunat
bowed
pray
be
seated
was
his
reply
i
remember
your
friend
very
well
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
gave
him
some
advice
with
reference
to
his
third
precisely
and
it
is
because
i
find
myself
in
the
same
fix
as
bouscat
that
i
have
called
on
you
business
is
very
bad
and
i
have
notes
to
a
large
amount
overdue
so
that
you
will
be
obliged
to
go
into
alas
i
fear
fortunat
already
knew
what
his
client
desired
but
it
was
against
his
principles
to
meet
these
propositions
more
than
half
way
will
you
state
your
case
said
he
the
coal
merchant
blushed
it
was
hard
to
confess
the
truth
but
the
effort
had
to
be
made
this
is
my
case
he
replied
at
last
among
my
creditors
i
have
several
enemies
who
will
refuse
me
a
release
they
would
like
to
deprive
me
of
everything
i
possess
and
in
that
case
what
would
become
of
me
is
it
right
that
i
should
be
compelled
to
starve
it
is
a
bad
it
is
indeed
monsieur
and
for
this
reason
i
desire
if
possible
if
i
can
do
so
without
danger
for
i
am
an
honest
man
monsieur
i
wish
to
retain
a
little
property
secretly
of
course
not
for
myself
by
any
means
but
i
have
a
young
wife
and
fortunat
took
compassion
on
the
man
s
embarrassment
in
short
he
interrupted
you
wish
to
conceal
a
part
of
your
capital
from
your
creditors
on
hearing
this
precise
and
formal
statement
of
his
honorable
intentions
the
trembled
his
feelings
of
integrity
would
not
have
been
alarmed
by
a
periphrasis
but
this
plain
speaking
shocked
him
oh
monsieur
he
protested
i
would
rather
blow
my
brains
out
than
defraud
my
creditors
of
a
single
penny
that
was
rightfully
theirs
what
i
am
doing
is
for
their
interest
you
understand
i
shall
begin
business
again
under
my
wife
s
name
and
if
i
succeed
they
shall
be
paid
yes
monsieur
every
sou
with
interest
ah
if
i
had
only
myself
to
think
of
it
would
be
quite
different
but
i
have
two
children
two
little
girls
so
that
very
well
replied
fortunat
i
should
suggest
to
you
the
same
expedient
as
i
suggested
to
your
friend
bouscat
but
you
must
gather
a
little
ready
money
together
before
going
into
i
can
do
that
by
secretly
disposing
of
a
part
of
my
stock
so
in
that
case
you
are
saved
sell
it
and
put
the
money
beyond
your
creditors
the
worthy
merchant
scratched
his
ear
in
evident
perplexity
excuse
me
said
he
i
had
thought
of
this
plan
but
it
seemed
to
me
dishonorable
and
also
very
dangerous
how
could
i
explain
this
decrease
in
my
stock
my
creditors
hate
me
if
they
suspected
anything
they
would
accuse
me
of
fraud
and
perhaps
throw
me
into
prison
and
then
fortunat
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
i
give
advice
he
roughly
replied
i
furnish
the
means
of
following
it
without
danger
listen
to
me
attentively
let
us
suppose
for
a
moment
that
some
time
ago
you
purchased
at
a
very
high
figure
a
quantity
of
stocks
and
shares
which
are
almost
worthless
could
not
this
unfortunate
investment
account
for
the
absence
of
the
sum
which
you
wish
to
set
aside
your
creditors
would
be
obliged
to
value
these
securities
not
at
their
present
but
at
their
former
evidently
but
unfortunately
i
do
not
possess
any
such
you
can
purchase
the
opened
his
eyes
in
astonishment
excuse
me
he
muttered
i
don
t
exactly
understand
he
did
not
understand
in
the
least
but
fortunat
enlightened
him
by
opening
his
safe
and
displaying
an
enormous
bundle
of
stocks
and
shares
which
had
flooded
the
country
a
few
years
previously
and
ruined
a
great
many
poor
ignorant
fools
which
were
hungering
for
wealth
among
them
were
shares
in
the
tifila
mining
company
the
berchem
coal
mines
the
greenland
fisheries
the
mutual
trust
and
loan
association
and
so
on
there
had
been
a
time
when
each
of
these
securities
would
have
fetched
five
hundred
or
a
thousand
francs
at
the
bourse
but
now
they
were
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
they
were
printed
let
us
suppose
my
dear
sir
resumed
fortunat
that
you
had
a
drawer
full
of
these
securities
but
the
other
did
not
allow
him
to
finish
i
see
he
exclaimed
i
see
i
can
sell
my
stock
and
put
the
proceeds
in
my
pocket
with
perfect
safety
there
is
enough
to
represent
my
capital
a
thousand
times
and
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
he
added
give
me
enough
of
these
shares
to
represent
a
capital
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
and
give
me
some
of
each
kind
i
should
like
my
creditors
to
have
a
thereupon
fortunat
counted
out
a
pile
of
these
worthless
securities
as
carefully
as
if
he
had
been
handling
and
his
client
at
the
same
time
drew
out
his
pocketbook
how
much
do
i
owe
you
he
inquired
three
thousand
the
honest
merchant
bounded
from
his
chair
three
thousand
francs
he
repeated
you
must
be
jesting
that
trash
is
not
worth
a
i
would
not
even
give
five
francs
for
it
rejoined
fortunat
coldly
but
it
is
true
that
i
don
t
desire
to
purchase
these
shares
in
my
creditors
interest
with
you
it
is
quite
a
different
matter
this
trash
as
you
very
justly
call
it
will
save
you
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
francs
i
ask
only
three
per
which
is
certainly
not
dear
still
you
know
i
don
t
force
any
one
to
purchase
and
in
a
terribly
significant
tone
he
added
you
can
undoubtedly
buy
similar
securities
on
better
terms
but
take
care
you
don
t
arouse
your
creditors
suspicions
by
applying
he
would
betray
me
the
scoundrel
thought
the
merchant
and
realizing
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
trap
here
are
three
thousand
francs
he
sighed
but
at
least
my
dear
sir
give
me
good
measure
and
throw
in
a
few
thousand
francs
the
smiled
the
ghastly
smile
of
a
man
who
sees
no
way
of
escape
from
imposition
and
has
therefore
resolved
to
submit
with
the
best
grace
possible
but
fortunat
s
gravity
did
not
relax
he
gave
what
he
had
promised
neither
more
nor
less
in
exchange
for
the
and
even
gravely
exclaimed
see
if
the
amount
is
his
client
pocketed
the
shares
without
counting
them
but
before
leaving
the
room
he
made
his
estimable
adviser
promise
to
assist
him
at
the
decisive
moment
and
help
him
to
prepare
one
of
those
clear
financial
statements
which
make
creditors
say
this
is
an
honest
man
who
has
been
extremely
fortunat
was
admirably
fitted
to
render
this
little
service
for
he
devoted
such
part
of
his
time
as
was
not
spent
in
hunting
for
missing
heirs
to
difficult
liquidations
and
he
had
indeed
made
bankruptcy
a
specialty
in
which
he
was
without
a
rival
the
business
was
a
remunerative
one
thanks
to
the
expedient
he
had
revealed
to
the
an
expedient
which
is
common
enough
nowadays
but
of
which
he
might
almost
be
called
the
inventor
it
consisted
in
compelling
the
persons
who
asked
for
his
advice
to
purchase
worthless
shares
at
whatever
price
he
chose
to
set
upon
them
and
they
were
forced
to
submit
under
penalty
of
denunciation
and
exposure
the
client
who
followed
the
proved
to
be
a
simple
creature
who
had
called
to
ask
for
some
advice
respecting
a
slight
difficulty
between
himself
and
his
landlord
fortunat
speedily
disposed
of
him
and
then
opening
the
door
leading
into
the
outer
office
he
called
cashier
a
man
some
years
of
age
at
once
entered
the
private
sanctum
carrying
a
in
one
hand
and
a
ledger
in
the
other
how
many
debtors
were
visited
yesterday
inquired
fortunat
two
hundred
and
what
was
the
amount
collected
isidore
fortunat
s
grimace
was
expressive
of
satisfaction
not
bad
said
he
not
at
all
then
a
singular
performance
began
fortunat
called
over
the
names
of
his
debtors
one
by
one
and
the
cashier
answered
each
name
by
reading
a
memorandum
written
against
it
on
the
margin
of
a
list
he
held
such
a
one
said
the
agent
and
such
a
one
and
such
whereupon
the
cashier
replied
has
paid
two
francs
was
not
at
home
paid
twenty
sous
would
not
pay
how
did
it
happen
that
fortunat
had
so
many
debtors
this
question
can
be
easily
answered
in
settling
bankrupts
estates
it
was
easy
for
him
to
purchase
a
large
number
of
debts
which
were
considered
worthless
at
a
trifling
cost
and
he
reaped
a
bountiful
harvest
on
a
field
which
would
have
yielded
nothing
to
another
person
it
was
not
because
he
was
rigorous
in
his
demands
he
conquered
by
patience
gentleness
and
politeness
but
also
by
unwearying
perseverance
and
tenacity
when
he
decided
that
a
debtor
was
to
pay
him
a
certain
sum
it
was
paid
he
never
relaxed
in
his
efforts
every
other
day
some
one
was
sent
to
visit
the
debtor
to
follow
him
and
harass
him
he
was
surrounded
by
fortunat
s
agents
they
pursued
him
to
his
office
shop
or
cafe
everywhere
continually
incessantly
and
always
with
the
most
perfect
urbanity
at
last
even
the
most
determined
succumbed
to
escape
this
frightful
persecution
they
somehow
or
other
found
the
money
to
satisfy
fortunat
s
claim
besides
victor
chupin
he
had
five
other
agents
whose
business
it
was
to
visit
these
poor
wretches
a
list
was
assigned
to
each
man
every
morning
and
when
evening
came
he
made
his
report
to
the
cashier
who
in
turn
reported
to
his
employer
this
branch
of
industry
added
considerably
to
the
profits
of
fortunat
s
other
business
and
was
the
third
and
last
string
to
his
bow
the
report
proceeded
as
usual
but
it
was
quite
evident
that
fortunat
s
thoughts
were
elsewhere
he
paused
each
moment
to
listen
eagerly
for
the
slightest
sound
outside
for
before
receiving
the
he
had
told
victor
chupin
to
run
to
the
rue
de
courcelles
and
ask
casimir
for
news
of
the
count
de
chalusse
he
had
done
this
more
than
an
hour
before
and
victor
chupin
who
was
usually
so
prompt
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
at
last
however
he
returned
whereupon
fortunat
dismissed
the
cashier
and
addressed
his
messenger
well
he
asked
he
is
no
longer
living
they
think
he
died
without
a
will
and
that
the
pretty
young
lady
will
be
turned
out
of
the
this
information
agreed
so
perfectly
with
fortunat
s
presentiments
that
he
did
not
even
wince
but
calmly
asked
will
casimir
keep
his
appointment
he
told
me
that
he
would
endeavor
to
come
and
i
d
wager
a
hundred
to
one
that
he
will
be
there
he
would
travel
ten
leagues
to
put
something
good
into
his
fortunat
s
opinion
coincided
with
chupin
s
very
well
said
he
only
you
were
a
long
time
on
the
road
that
s
true
m
sieur
but
i
had
a
little
matter
of
my
own
to
attend
to
a
matter
of
a
hundred
francs
if
you
fortunat
knit
his
brows
angrily
it
s
only
right
to
attend
to
business
said
he
but
you
think
too
much
of
money
victor
altogether
too
much
you
are
the
young
man
proudly
lifted
his
head
and
with
an
air
of
importance
replied
i
have
so
many
responsibilities
responsibilities
you
yes
indeed
m
sieur
and
why
not
my
poor
good
mother
hasn
t
been
able
to
work
for
a
year
and
who
would
care
for
her
if
i
didn
t
certainly
not
my
father
the
scamp
who
squandered
all
the
duke
de
sairmeuse
s
money
without
giving
us
a
sou
of
it
besides
i
m
like
other
men
i
m
anxious
to
be
rich
and
enjoy
myself
i
should
like
to
ride
in
my
carriage
like
other
people
do
and
whenever
a
gamin
such
as
i
was
once
opened
the
door
for
me
i
should
put
a
piece
in
his
hand
he
was
interrupted
by
madame
dodelin
the
worthy
housekeeper
who
rushed
into
the
room
without
knocking
in
a
terrible
state
of
excitement
monsieur
she
exclaimed
in
the
same
tone
as
if
she
would
have
called
fire
here
is
monsieur
de
fortunat
sprang
up
and
turned
extremely
pale
what
to
the
devil
brings
him
here
he
anxiously
stammered
tell
him
that
i
ve
gone
out
tell
him
but
it
was
useless
for
the
marquis
at
that
very
moment
entered
the
room
and
the
agent
could
only
dismiss
his
housekeeper
and
chupin
de
valorsay
seemed
to
be
very
angry
and
it
looked
as
if
he
meant
to
give
vent
to
his
passion
indeed
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
with
fortunat
he
began
so
this
is
the
way
you
betray
your
friends
master
why
did
you
deceive
me
last
night
about
the
ten
thousand
francs
you
had
promised
me
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
the
truth
you
knew
of
the
misfortune
that
had
befallen
de
chalusse
i
heard
of
it
first
scarcely
an
hour
ago
through
a
letter
from
madame
fortunat
hesitated
somewhat
he
was
a
quiet
man
opposed
to
violence
of
any
kind
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
de
valorsay
was
twisting
and
turning
his
cane
in
a
most
ominous
manner
i
must
confess
monsieur
le
marquis
he
at
last
replied
that
i
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
you
of
the
dreadful
misfortune
which
had
befallen
how
us
certainly
if
you
lose
the
hope
of
several
millions
i
also
lose
the
amount
i
advanced
to
you
forty
thousand
francs
my
entire
fortune
and
yet
you
see
that
i
don
t
complain
do
as
i
do
confess
that
the
game
is
the
marquis
was
listening
with
an
air
of
suppressed
wrath
his
face
was
crimson
there
was
a
dark
frown
on
his
brow
and
his
hands
were
clinched
he
was
apparently
furious
with
passion
but
in
reality
he
was
perfectly
the
best
proof
that
can
be
given
of
his
coolness
is
that
he
was
carefully
studying
fortunat
s
face
and
trying
to
discover
the
agent
s
real
intentions
under
his
meaningless
words
he
had
expected
to
find
his
dear
extortioner
exasperated
by
his
loss
cursing
and
swearing
and
demanding
his
money
but
not
at
all
he
found
him
more
gentle
and
calm
colder
and
more
reserved
than
ever
brimful
of
resignation
indeed
and
preaching
submission
to
the
inevitable
what
can
this
mean
he
thought
with
an
anxious
heart
what
mischief
is
the
scoundrel
plotting
now
i
d
wager
a
thousand
to
one
that
he
s
forging
some
thunderbolt
to
crush
and
in
a
haughty
tone
he
said
aloud
in
a
word
you
desert
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
fortunat
exclaimed
i
desert
you
monsieur
le
marquis
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
think
so
ill
of
me
alas
circumstances
are
the
only
traitors
i
shouldn
t
like
to
deprive
you
of
the
courage
you
so
much
need
but
honestly
it
would
be
folly
to
struggle
against
destiny
how
can
you
hope
to
succeed
in
your
plans
have
you
not
resorted
to
every
possible
expedient
to
prolong
your
apparently
brilliant
existence
until
the
present
time
are
you
not
at
such
a
point
that
you
must
marry
mademoiselle
marguerite
in
a
month
s
time
or
perish
and
now
the
count
s
millions
are
lost
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
give
you
some
advice
i
should
say
the
shipwreck
is
inevitable
think
only
of
saving
by
tact
and
shrewdness
you
might
yet
save
something
from
your
creditors
compromise
with
them
and
if
you
need
my
services
here
i
am
go
to
nice
and
give
me
a
power
of
attorney
to
act
for
you
from
the
debris
of
your
fortune
i
will
undertake
to
guarantee
you
a
competence
which
would
satisfy
many
an
ambitious
the
marquis
laughed
sneeringly
excellent
he
exclaimed
you
would
rid
yourself
of
me
and
recover
your
forty
thousand
francs
at
the
same
time
a
very
clever
fortunat
realized
that
his
client
understood
him
but
what
did
it
matter
i
assure
you
he
began
but
the
marquis
silenced
him
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
let
us
stop
this
nonsense
said
he
we
understand
each
other
better
than
that
i
have
never
made
any
attempt
to
deceive
you
nor
have
i
ever
supposed
that
i
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
pray
do
me
the
honor
to
consider
me
as
shrewd
as
and
still
refusing
to
listen
to
the
agent
he
continued
if
i
have
come
to
you
it
is
only
because
the
case
is
not
so
desperate
as
you
suppose
i
still
hold
some
valuable
cards
which
you
are
ignorant
of
in
your
opinion
and
every
one
else
s
mademoiselle
marguerite
is
ruined
but
i
know
that
she
is
still
worth
three
millions
at
the
very
mademoiselle
marguerite
yes
monsieur
let
her
become
my
wife
and
the
very
next
day
i
will
place
her
in
possession
of
an
income
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
but
she
must
marry
me
first
and
this
scornful
maiden
will
not
grant
me
her
hand
unless
i
can
convince
her
of
my
love
and
but
your
rival
de
valorsay
gave
a
nervous
start
but
quickly
controlled
himself
he
no
longer
exists
read
this
day
s
figaro
and
you
will
be
edified
i
have
no
rival
now
if
i
can
only
conceal
my
financial
embarrassment
a
little
longer
she
is
mine
a
friendless
and
homeless
girl
can
not
defend
herself
long
in
paris
especially
when
she
has
an
adviser
like
madame
leon
oh
i
shall
win
her
i
shall
have
her
she
is
a
necessity
to
me
now
you
can
judge
if
it
would
be
wise
on
your
part
to
deprive
me
of
your
assistance
would
you
like
to
know
what
i
want
simply
this
the
means
to
sustain
me
two
or
three
months
longer
some
thirty
thousand
francs
you
can
procure
the
money
will
you
it
would
make
in
all
seventy
thousand
francs
that
i
should
owe
you
and
i
will
promise
to
pay
you
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
if
i
succeed
and
i
shall
succeed
such
profit
is
worth
some
risk
reflect
and
decide
but
no
more
subterfuges
if
you
please
let
your
answer
be
plain
yes
or
without
a
second
s
hesitation
fortunat
replied
the
flush
on
the
marquis
s
face
deepened
and
his
voice
became
a
trifle
harsher
but
that
was
all
confess
then
that
you
have
resolved
to
ruin
me
he
said
you
refuse
before
you
have
heard
me
to
the
end
wait
at
least
until
i
have
told
you
my
plans
and
shown
you
the
solid
foundation
which
my
hopes
rest
but
fortunat
had
resolved
to
listen
to
nothing
he
wished
for
no
explanations
so
distrustful
was
he
of
himself
so
much
did
he
fear
that
his
adventurous
nature
would
urge
him
to
incur
further
risk
he
was
positively
afraid
of
the
marquis
de
valorsay
s
eloquence
besides
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
person
who
consents
to
listen
is
at
least
half
convinced
tell
me
nothing
monsieur
he
hastily
answered
it
would
be
useless
i
haven
t
the
money
if
i
had
given
you
ten
thousand
francs
last
night
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
borrow
them
of
prosper
bertomy
and
even
if
i
had
the
money
i
should
still
say
every
man
has
his
system
his
theory
you
know
mine
is
never
to
run
after
my
money
with
me
whatever
i
may
lose
i
regard
it
as
finally
lost
i
think
no
more
about
it
and
turn
to
something
else
so
your
forty
thousand
francs
have
already
been
entered
on
my
profit
and
loss
account
and
yet
it
would
be
easy
enough
for
you
to
repay
me
if
you
would
follow
my
advice
and
go
quietly
into
never
interrupted
de
valorsay
never
i
do
not
wish
to
temporize
he
continued
i
will
save
all
or
save
nothing
if
you
refuse
me
your
help
i
shall
apply
elsewhere
i
will
never
give
my
good
friends
who
detest
me
and
whom
i
cordially
hate
in
return
the
delicious
joy
of
seeing
the
marquis
de
valorsay
fall
step
by
step
from
the
high
position
he
has
occupied
i
will
never
truckle
to
the
men
whom
i
have
eclipsed
for
fifteen
years
no
never
i
would
rather
die
or
even
commit
the
greatest
crime
he
suddenly
checked
himself
a
trifle
astonished
perhaps
by
his
own
and
for
a
moment
he
and
fortunat
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
striving
to
divine
their
respective
secret
thoughts
the
marquis
was
the
first
to
speak
and
so
said
he
in
a
tone
which
he
strove
to
make
persuasive
but
which
was
threatening
instead
it
is
settled
your
decision
is
final
you
will
not
even
condescend
to
listen
to
my
explanation
it
would
be
a
loss
of
on
receiving
this
cruel
reply
de
valorsay
struck
the
desk
such
a
formidable
blow
with
his
clenched
fist
that
several
bundles
of
papers
fell
to
the
floor
his
anger
was
not
feigned
now
what
are
you
plotting
then
he
exclaimed
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
what
is
your
object
in
betraying
me
take
care
it
is
my
life
that
i
am
going
to
defend
and
as
truly
as
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
i
shall
defend
it
well
a
man
who
is
determined
to
blow
his
brains
out
if
he
is
defeated
is
a
terribly
dangerous
adversary
woe
to
you
if
i
ever
find
you
standing
between
me
and
the
count
de
chalusse
s
millions
every
drop
of
blood
had
fled
from
fortunat
s
face
still
his
mien
was
composed
and
dignified
you
do
wrong
to
threaten
me
said
he
i
don
t
fear
you
in
the
least
if
i
were
your
enemy
i
should
bring
suit
against
you
for
the
forty
thousand
francs
you
owe
me
i
should
not
obtain
my
money
of
course
but
i
could
shatter
the
tottering
edifice
of
your
fortune
by
a
single
blow
besides
you
forget
that
i
possess
a
copy
of
our
agreement
signed
by
your
own
hand
and
that
i
have
only
to
show
it
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
to
give
her
a
just
opinion
of
your
disinterestedness
let
us
sever
our
connection
now
monsieur
and
each
go
his
own
way
without
reference
to
the
other
if
you
should
succeed
you
will
repay
victory
perched
upon
the
agent
s
banner
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
pride
that
he
saw
his
noble
client
depart
white
and
speechless
with
rage
what
a
rascal
that
marquis
is
he
muttered
i
would
certainly
warn
mademoiselle
marguerite
poor
girl
if
i
were
not
so
much
afraid
of
xiv
casimir
the
deceased
count
de
chalusse
s
valet
was
neither
better
nor
worse
than
most
of
his
fellows
old
men
tell
us
that
there
formerly
existed
a
race
of
faithful
servants
who
considered
themselves
a
part
of
the
family
that
employed
them
and
who
unhesitatingly
embraced
its
interests
and
its
ideas
at
the
same
time
their
masters
requited
their
devotion
by
efficacious
protection
and
provision
for
the
future
but
such
masters
and
such
servants
are
nowadays
only
found
in
the
old
melodramas
performed
at
the
ambigu
in
the
emigre
for
instance
or
in
the
last
of
the
at
present
servants
wander
from
one
house
to
another
looking
on
their
abode
as
a
mere
inn
where
they
may
find
shelter
till
they
are
disposed
for
another
journey
and
families
receive
them
as
transient
and
not
unfrequently
as
dangerous
guests
whom
it
is
always
wise
to
treat
with
distrust
the
key
of
the
is
not
confided
to
these
unreliable
inmates
they
are
intrusted
with
the
charge
of
little
else
than
the
children
a
practice
which
is
often
productive
of
terrible
results
casimir
was
no
doubt
honest
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
he
would
have
scorned
to
rob
his
master
of
a
piece
and
yet
he
would
not
have
hesitated
in
the
least
to
defraud
him
of
a
hundred
francs
if
an
opportunity
had
presented
itself
vain
and
rapacious
in
disposition
he
consoled
himself
by
refusing
to
obey
any
one
save
his
employer
by
envying
him
with
his
whole
heart
and
by
cursing
fate
for
not
having
made
him
the
count
de
chalusse
instead
of
the
count
de
chalusse
s
servant
as
he
received
high
wages
he
served
passably
well
but
he
employed
the
best
part
of
his
energy
in
watching
the
count
he
scented
some
great
family
secret
in
the
household
and
he
felt
angry
and
humiliated
that
this
secret
had
not
been
intrusted
to
his
discretion
and
if
he
had
discovered
nothing
it
was
because
de
chalusse
had
been
caution
personified
as
madame
leon
had
declared
thus
it
happened
that
when
casimir
saw
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
the
count
searching
in
the
garden
for
the
fragments
of
a
letter
destroyed
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
which
he
had
personally
witnessed
his
natural
curiosity
was
heightened
to
such
a
degree
as
to
become
unendurable
he
would
have
given
a
month
s
wages
and
something
over
to
have
known
the
contents
of
that
letter
the
fragments
of
which
were
being
so
carefully
collected
by
the
count
and
when
he
heard
de
chalusse
tell
mademoiselle
marguerite
that
the
most
important
part
of
the
letter
was
still
lacking
and
saw
his
master
relinquish
his
fruitless
search
the
worthy
valet
vowed
that
he
would
be
more
skilful
or
more
fortunate
than
his
master
and
after
diligent
effort
he
actually
succeeded
in
recovering
five
tiny
scraps
of
paper
which
had
been
blown
into
the
shrubbery
they
were
covered
with
delicate
handwriting
a
lady
s
unquestionably
but
he
was
utterly
unable
to
extract
the
slightest
meaning
from
them
nevertheless
he
preserved
them
with
jealous
care
and
was
careful
not
to
say
that
he
had
found
them
the
incoherent
words
which
he
had
deciphered
on
these
scraps
of
paper
mixed
strangely
in
his
brain
and
he
grew
more
and
more
anxious
to
learn
what
connection
there
was
between
this
letter
and
the
count
s
attack
this
explains
his
extreme
readiness
to
search
the
count
s
clothes
when
mademoiselle
marguerite
told
him
to
look
for
the
key
of
the
escritoire
and
fortune
favored
him
for
he
not
only
found
the
key
but
he
also
discovered
the
torn
fragments
of
the
letter
and
having
crumpled
them
up
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
contrived
to
slip
them
into
his
pocket
fruitless
dexterity
casimir
had
joined
these
scraps
to
the
fragments
he
had
found
himself
he
had
read
and
the
epistle
but
it
told
him
nothing
or
at
least
the
information
it
conveyed
was
so
vague
and
incomplete
that
it
heightened
his
curiosity
all
the
more
once
he
almost
decided
to
give
the
letter
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
but
he
resisted
this
impulse
saying
to
himself
ah
no
i
m
not
such
a
fool
it
might
be
of
use
to
and
casimir
had
no
desire
to
be
of
service
to
this
unhappy
girl
who
had
always
treated
him
with
kindness
he
hated
her
under
the
pretence
that
she
was
not
in
her
proper
place
that
no
one
knew
who
or
what
she
was
and
that
it
was
absurd
that
he
he
casimir
should
be
compelled
to
receive
orders
from
her
the
infamous
slander
which
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
overheard
on
her
way
home
from
church
there
goes
the
rich
count
de
chalusse
s
mistress
was
casimir
s
work
he
had
sworn
to
be
avenged
on
this
haughty
creature
and
no
one
can
say
what
he
might
have
attempted
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
intervention
of
the
magistrate
imperatively
called
to
order
casimir
consoled
himself
by
the
thought
that
the
magistrate
had
intrusted
him
with
eight
thousand
francs
and
the
charge
of
the
establishment
nothing
could
have
pleased
him
better
first
and
foremost
it
afforded
him
a
magnificent
opportunity
to
display
his
authority
and
act
the
master
and
it
also
enabled
him
to
carry
out
his
compact
with
victor
chupin
and
repair
to
the
rendezvous
which
isidore
fortunat
had
appointed
leaving
his
comrades
to
watch
the
magistrate
s
operations
he
sent
bourigeau
to
report
the
count
s
death
at
the
district
mayor
s
office
and
then
lighting
a
cigar
he
walked
out
of
the
house
and
strolled
leisurely
up
the
rue
de
courcelles
the
place
appointed
for
his
meeting
with
fortunat
was
on
the
boulevard
haussmann
almost
opposite
binder
s
the
famous
carriage
builder
although
it
was
rather
a
than
a
restaurant
a
capital
breakfast
could
be
obtained
there
as
casimir
had
ascertained
to
his
satisfaction
several
times
before
has
no
one
called
for
me
he
asked
as
he
went
in
no
he
consulted
his
watch
and
evinced
considerable
surprise
not
yet
noon
he
exclaimed
i
m
in
advance
and
as
that
is
the
case
give
me
a
glass
of
absinthe
and
a
he
was
obeyed
with
far
more
alacrity
than
his
deceased
master
had
ever
required
him
to
show
and
he
forthwith
plunged
into
the
report
of
the
doings
at
the
bourse
with
the
eagerness
of
a
man
who
has
an
reason
for
his
anxiety
in
a
drawer
at
home
having
emptied
one
glass
of
absinthe
he
was
about
to
order
a
second
when
he
felt
a
tap
on
the
shoulder
and
on
turning
round
he
beheld
isidore
fortunat
in
accordance
with
his
wont
the
agent
was
attired
in
a
style
of
severe
elegance
with
gloves
and
boots
fitting
him
to
perfection
but
an
unusually
winning
smile
played
upon
his
lips
you
see
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
exclaimed
casimir
i
am
late
it
s
true
replied
fortunat
but
we
will
do
our
best
to
make
up
for
lost
time
for
i
trust
you
will
do
me
the
honor
of
breakfasting
with
me
really
i
don
t
know
that
i
yes
yes
you
must
they
will
give
us
a
private
room
we
must
have
a
it
was
certainly
not
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
that
fortunat
cultivated
casimir
s
acquaintance
and
entertained
him
at
breakfast
fortunat
who
was
a
very
proud
man
considered
this
connection
somewhat
beneath
his
dignity
but
at
first
circumstances
and
afterward
interest
had
required
him
to
overcome
his
repugnance
it
was
through
the
count
de
chalusse
that
he
had
made
casimir
s
acquaintance
while
the
count
was
employing
the
agent
he
had
frequently
sent
his
valet
to
him
with
messages
and
letters
naturally
casimir
had
talked
on
these
occasions
and
the
agent
had
listened
to
him
hence
this
superficial
friendship
subsequently
when
the
marriage
contemplated
by
the
marquis
de
valorsay
was
in
course
of
preparation
fortunat
had
profited
of
the
opportunity
to
make
the
count
s
servant
his
spy
and
it
had
been
easy
to
find
a
pretext
for
continuing
the
acquaintance
as
casimir
was
a
speculator
or
rather
a
dabbler
in
stocks
and
shares
so
whenever
he
needed
information
fortunat
invited
casimir
to
breakfast
knowing
the
potent
influence
of
a
good
bottle
of
wine
offered
at
the
right
moment
it
is
needless
to
say
that
he
exercised
uncommon
care
in
the
composition
of
the
menu
on
a
day
like
this
when
his
future
course
depended
perhaps
on
a
word
more
or
less
casimir
s
eye
sparkled
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
table
opposite
his
entertainer
the
crafty
agent
had
chosen
a
little
room
looking
out
on
to
the
boulevard
not
that
it
was
more
spacious
or
elegant
than
the
others
but
it
was
isolated
and
this
was
a
very
great
advantage
for
every
one
knows
how
unsafe
and
perfidious
are
those
private
rooms
which
are
merely
separated
from
each
other
by
a
thin
partition
scarcely
thicker
than
a
sheet
of
paper
it
was
not
long
before
fortunat
had
reason
to
congratulate
himself
on
his
foresight
for
the
breakfast
began
with
a
dish
of
shrimps
and
casimir
had
not
finished
his
twelfth
washed
down
by
a
glass
of
chablis
before
he
declared
that
he
could
see
no
impropriety
in
confiding
certain
things
to
a
friend
the
events
of
the
morning
had
completely
turned
his
head
and
gratified
vanity
and
good
cheer
excited
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
discoursed
with
unwonted
volubility
with
total
disregard
of
prudence
he
talked
with
inexcusable
freedom
of
the
count
de
chalusse
and
de
valorsay
and
especially
of
his
enemy
mademoiselle
marguerite
for
it
is
she
he
exclaimed
rapping
on
the
table
with
his
knife
it
is
she
who
has
taken
the
missing
millions
how
she
did
it
no
one
will
ever
know
for
she
has
not
an
equal
in
craftiness
but
it
s
she
who
has
stolen
them
i
m
sure
of
it
i
would
have
taken
my
oath
to
that
effect
before
the
magistrate
and
i
would
have
proved
it
too
if
he
hadn
t
taken
her
part
because
she
s
pretty
for
she
is
devilishly
even
if
fortunat
had
wished
to
put
in
a
word
or
two
he
could
have
found
no
opportunity
but
his
guest
s
loquacity
did
not
displease
him
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
for
reflection
strange
thoughts
arose
in
his
mind
and
connecting
casimir
s
affirmations
with
the
assurances
of
the
marquis
de
valorsay
he
was
amazed
at
the
coincidence
it
s
very
singular
he
thought
has
this
girl
really
stolen
the
money
and
has
the
marquis
discovered
the
fact
through
madame
leon
and
determined
to
profit
by
the
theft
in
that
case
i
may
get
my
money
back
after
all
i
must
look
into
the
a
partridge
and
a
bottle
of
pomard
followed
the
shrimps
and
chablis
and
casimir
s
loquacity
increased
and
his
voice
rose
higher
and
higher
he
wandered
from
one
absurd
story
to
another
and
from
slander
to
slander
until
suddenly
and
without
the
slightest
warning
he
began
to
speak
of
the
mysterious
letter
which
he
considered
the
undoubted
cause
of
the
count
s
illness
at
the
first
word
respecting
this
missive
fortunat
started
violently
nonsense
said
he
with
an
incredulous
air
why
the
devil
should
this
letter
have
had
such
an
influence
i
don
t
know
but
it
is
certain
it
and
in
support
of
his
assertion
he
told
fortunat
how
the
count
had
destroyed
the
letter
almost
without
reading
it
and
how
he
had
afterward
searched
for
the
fragments
in
order
to
find
an
address
it
had
contained
and
i
m
quite
sure
said
the
valet
that
the
count
intended
to
apply
to
you
for
the
address
of
the
person
who
wrote
the
are
you
sure
of
that
as
sure
as
i
am
of
drinking
pomard
exclaimed
casimir
draining
his
glass
rarely
had
the
agent
experienced
such
emotion
he
did
not
doubt
but
what
this
missive
contained
the
solution
of
the
mystery
were
the
scraps
of
this
letter
found
he
asked
i
have
them
cried
the
valet
triumphantly
i
have
them
in
my
pocket
and
what
s
more
i
have
the
whole
of
them
this
declaration
made
fortunat
turn
pale
with
delight
indeed
indeed
said
he
it
must
be
a
strange
his
companion
pursed
up
his
lips
disdainfully
may
be
so
may
be
not
he
retorted
it
s
impossible
to
understand
a
word
of
it
the
only
thing
certain
about
it
is
that
it
was
written
by
a
ah
yes
by
a
former
mistress
undoubtedly
and
naturally
she
asks
for
money
for
a
child
women
of
that
class
always
do
so
they
ve
tried
the
game
with
me
more
than
a
dozen
times
but
i
m
not
so
easily
and
bursting
with
vanity
he
related
three
or
four
love
affairs
in
which
according
to
his
own
account
he
must
have
played
a
most
ignoble
part
if
fortunat
s
chair
had
been
a
gridiron
heated
by
an
excellent
fire
he
could
not
have
felt
more
uncomfortable
after
pouring
out
bumper
after
bumper
for
his
guest
he
perceived
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
that
it
would
not
be
easy
to
check
him
and
this
letter
he
interrupted
at
last
well
you
promised
to
let
me
read
that
s
true
that
s
quite
true
but
it
would
be
as
well
to
have
some
mocha
first
would
it
not
what
if
we
ordered
some
mocha
eh
coffee
was
served
and
when
the
waiter
had
closed
the
door
casimir
drew
the
letter
the
scraps
of
which
were
fixed
together
from
his
pocket
and
unfolded
it
saying
attention
i
m
going
to
this
did
not
suit
fortunat
s
fancy
he
would
infinitely
have
preferred
perusing
it
himself
but
it
is
impossible
to
argue
with
an
intoxicated
man
and
so
casimir
with
a
more
and
more
indistinct
enunciation
read
as
follows
paris
october
so
the
lady
lives
in
paris
as
usual
after
this
she
puts
neither
monsieur
nor
my
friend
nor
dear
count
nothing
at
all
she
begins
abruptly
once
before
many
years
ago
i
came
to
you
as
a
suppliant
you
were
pitiless
and
did
not
even
deign
to
answer
me
and
yet
as
i
told
you
i
was
on
the
verge
of
a
terrible
precipice
my
brain
was
reeling
vertigo
had
seized
hold
of
me
deserted
i
was
wandering
about
paris
homeless
and
penniless
and
my
child
was
starving
casimir
paused
to
laugh
that
s
like
all
the
rest
of
them
he
exclaimed
that
is
exactly
like
all
the
rest
i
ve
ten
such
letters
in
my
drawer
even
more
imperative
in
their
demands
if
you
ll
come
home
with
me
after
breakfast
i
ll
show
them
to
you
we
ll
have
a
hearty
laugh
over
them
let
us
finish
this
of
and
he
resumed
if
i
had
been
alone
i
should
not
have
hesitated
i
was
so
wretched
that
death
seemed
a
refuge
to
me
but
what
was
to
become
of
my
child
should
i
kill
him
and
destroy
myself
afterward
i
thought
of
doing
so
but
i
lacked
the
courage
and
what
i
implored
you
in
pity
to
give
me
was
rightfully
mine
i
had
only
to
present
myself
at
your
house
and
demand
it
alas
i
did
not
know
that
then
i
believed
myself
bound
by
a
solemn
oath
and
you
inspired
me
with
inexpressible
terror
and
still
i
could
not
see
my
child
die
of
starvation
before
my
very
eyes
so
i
abandoned
myself
to
my
fate
and
i
have
sunk
so
low
that
i
have
been
obliged
to
separate
from
my
son
he
must
not
know
the
shame
to
which
he
owes
his
livelihood
and
he
is
ignorant
even
of
my
fortunat
was
as
motionless
as
if
he
had
been
turned
to
stone
after
the
information
he
had
obtained
respecting
the
count
s
past
and
after
the
story
told
him
by
madame
vantrasson
he
could
scarcely
doubt
this
letter
he
thought
can
only
be
from
mademoiselle
hermine
de
however
casimir
resumed
his
reading
if
i
apply
to
you
again
if
from
the
depth
of
infamy
into
which
i
have
fallen
i
again
call
upon
you
for
help
it
is
because
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
resources
because
before
i
die
i
must
see
my
son
s
future
assured
it
is
not
a
fortune
that
i
ask
for
him
but
sufficient
to
live
upon
and
i
expect
to
receive
it
from
once
more
the
valet
paused
in
his
perusal
of
the
letter
to
remark
there
it
is
again
sufficient
to
live
upon
and
i
expect
to
receive
it
from
you
excellent
women
are
remarkable
creatures
upon
my
word
but
listen
to
the
rest
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
oblige
me
therefore
by
calling
october
at
the
hotel
de
homburg
in
the
rue
du
helder
you
will
ask
for
madame
lucy
huntley
and
they
will
conduct
you
to
me
i
shall
expect
you
from
three
o
clock
to
six
come
i
implore
you
come
it
is
painful
to
me
to
add
that
if
i
do
not
hear
from
you
i
am
resolved
to
demand
and
obtain
no
matter
what
may
be
the
consequences
the
means
which
i
have
so
far
asked
of
you
on
my
bended
knees
and
with
clasped
having
finished
the
letter
casimir
laid
it
on
the
table
and
poured
out
a
glassful
of
brandy
which
he
drained
at
a
single
draught
and
that
s
all
he
remarked
no
signature
not
even
an
initial
it
was
a
respectable
woman
who
wrote
that
they
never
sign
their
notes
the
hussies
for
fear
of
compromising
themselves
as
i
ve
reason
to
and
so
saying
he
laughed
the
idiotic
laugh
of
a
man
who
has
been
drinking
immoderately
if
i
had
time
he
resumed
i
should
make
some
inquiries
about
this
madame
lucy
huntley
a
feigned
name
evidently
i
should
like
to
know
but
what
s
the
matter
with
you
monsieur
fortunat
you
are
as
pale
as
death
are
you
ill
to
tell
the
truth
the
agent
did
look
as
if
he
were
indisposed
thanks
he
stammered
i
m
very
well
only
i
just
remembered
that
some
one
is
waiting
for
who
a
nonsense
rejoined
the
valet
make
some
excuse
let
him
go
about
his
business
aren
t
you
rich
enough
pour
us
out
another
glass
of
wine
it
will
make
you
all
right
fortunat
complied
but
he
performed
the
task
so
awkwardly
or
rather
so
skilfully
that
he
drew
toward
him
with
his
sleeve
the
letter
which
was
lying
beside
casimir
s
plate
to
your
health
said
the
valet
to
yours
replied
fortunat
and
in
drawing
back
the
arm
he
had
extended
to
chink
glasses
with
his
guest
he
caused
the
letter
to
fall
on
his
knees
casimir
who
had
not
observed
this
successful
manoeuvre
was
trying
to
light
his
cigar
and
while
vainly
consuming
a
large
quantity
of
matches
in
the
attempt
he
exclaimed
what
you
just
said
my
friend
means
that
you
would
like
to
desert
me
that
won
t
do
my
dear
fellow
you
are
going
home
with
me
and
i
will
read
you
some
from
a
woman
of
the
world
then
we
will
go
to
mourloup
s
and
play
a
game
of
billiards
that
s
the
place
to
enjoy
one
s
self
you
ll
see
joseph
of
the
commarin
household
a
splendid
very
well
but
first
i
must
settle
the
score
yes
fortunat
rang
for
his
bill
he
had
obtained
more
information
than
he
expected
he
had
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
he
had
now
only
one
desire
to
rid
himself
of
casimir
but
this
was
no
easy
task
drunken
men
cling
tenaciously
to
their
friends
and
fortunat
was
asking
himself
what
strategy
he
could
employ
when
the
waiter
entered
and
said
there
s
a
very
man
here
who
looks
as
if
he
were
a
huissier
s
clerk
he
wishes
to
speak
with
you
ah
it
s
chupin
exclaimed
the
valet
he
is
a
friend
let
him
come
in
and
bring
us
another
glass
the
more
the
merrier
as
the
saying
what
could
chupin
want
fortunat
had
no
idea
but
he
was
none
the
less
grateful
for
his
coming
being
determined
to
hand
this
troublesome
casimir
over
to
his
keeping
on
entering
the
room
chupin
realized
the
valet
s
condition
at
the
first
glance
and
his
face
clouded
he
bowed
politely
to
fortunat
but
addressed
casimir
in
an
extremely
discontented
tone
it
s
three
o
clock
said
he
and
i
ve
come
as
we
agreed
to
arrange
with
you
about
the
count
s
these
words
had
the
effect
of
a
cold
on
casimir
upon
my
word
i
had
forgotten
forgotten
entirely
upon
my
word
and
the
thought
of
his
condition
and
the
responsibility
he
had
accepted
coming
upon
him
at
the
same
time
he
continued
good
heavens
i
m
in
a
nice
state
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
stand
what
will
they
think
at
the
house
what
will
they
say
fortunat
had
drawn
his
clerk
a
little
on
one
side
victor
said
he
quickly
and
earnestly
i
must
go
at
once
everything
has
been
paid
for
but
in
case
you
need
some
money
for
a
cab
or
anything
of
the
sort
here
are
ten
francs
if
there
s
any
you
don
t
use
keep
it
for
yourself
i
leave
this
fool
in
your
charge
take
care
of
the
sight
of
the
piece
made
chupin
s
face
brighten
a
little
very
well
he
replied
i
understand
the
business
i
served
my
apprenticeship
as
a
guardian
angel
when
my
grandmother
kept
the
above
all
don
t
let
him
return
home
in
his
present
have
no
fears
monsieur
i
must
talk
business
with
him
and
so
i
shall
have
him
all
right
in
a
and
as
fortunat
made
his
escape
chupin
beckoned
to
the
waiter
and
said
fetch
me
some
very
strong
coffee
a
handful
of
salt
and
a
lemon
there
s
nothing
better
for
bringing
a
drunken
man
to
his
xv
fortunat
left
the
restaurant
almost
on
the
run
for
he
feared
that
he
might
be
pursued
and
overtaken
by
casimir
but
after
he
had
gone
a
couple
of
hundred
paces
he
paused
not
so
much
to
take
breath
as
to
collect
his
scattered
wits
and
though
the
weather
was
cold
he
seated
himself
on
a
bench
to
reflect
never
in
all
his
changeful
life
had
he
known
such
intense
anxiety
and
torturing
suspense
as
he
had
just
experienced
in
that
little
room
in
the
restaurant
he
had
longed
for
positive
information
and
he
had
obtained
it
but
it
had
upset
all
his
plans
and
annihilated
all
his
hopes
imagining
that
the
count
s
heirs
had
been
lost
sight
of
he
had
determined
to
find
them
and
make
a
bargain
with
them
before
they
learned
that
they
were
worth
their
millions
but
on
the
contrary
these
heirs
were
close
at
hand
watching
de
chalusse
and
knowing
their
rights
so
well
that
they
were
ready
to
fight
for
them
for
it
was
certainly
the
count
s
sister
who
wrote
the
letter
which
i
have
in
my
pocket
he
murmured
not
wishing
to
receive
him
at
her
own
home
she
prudently
appointed
a
meeting
at
a
hotel
but
what
about
this
name
of
huntley
is
it
really
hers
or
is
it
only
assumed
for
the
occasion
is
it
the
name
of
the
man
who
enticed
her
from
home
or
is
it
the
name
given
to
the
son
from
whom
she
has
separated
herself
but
after
all
what
was
the
use
of
all
these
conjectures
there
was
but
one
certain
and
positive
thing
and
this
was
that
the
money
he
had
counted
upon
had
escaped
him
and
he
experienced
as
acute
a
pang
as
if
he
had
lost
forty
thousand
francs
a
second
time
perhaps
at
that
moment
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
severed
his
connection
with
the
marquis
still
he
was
not
the
man
to
despond
however
desperate
his
plight
might
appear
without
an
attempt
to
better
his
situation
he
knew
how
many
surprising
and
sudden
changes
in
fortune
have
been
brought
about
by
some
apparently
trivial
action
i
must
discover
this
sister
he
said
to
himself
i
must
ascertain
her
position
and
her
plans
if
she
has
no
one
to
advise
her
i
will
offer
my
services
and
who
knows
a
cab
was
passing
fortunat
hailed
it
and
ordered
the
jehu
to
drive
him
to
the
rue
du
helder
no
hotel
de
homburg
was
it
by
chance
or
premeditation
that
this
establishment
had
received
the
name
of
one
of
the
gambling
dens
of
europe
perhaps
the
following
information
may
serve
to
answer
the
question
the
hotel
de
homburg
was
one
of
those
flash
hostelries
frequented
by
adventurers
of
distinction
who
are
attracted
to
paris
by
the
millions
that
are
annually
squandered
there
spurious
counts
and
questionable
russian
princesses
were
sure
to
find
a
cordial
welcome
there
with
princely
luxury
moderate
prices
and
but
very
little
confidence
each
person
was
called
by
the
title
which
it
pleased
him
to
give
on
his
arrival
excellency
or
prince
according
to
his
fancy
he
could
also
find
numerous
servants
carefully
drilled
to
play
the
part
of
old
family
retainers
and
carriages
upon
which
the
most
elaborate
could
be
painted
at
an
hour
s
notice
nor
was
there
any
difficulty
whatever
in
immediately
procuring
all
the
accessories
of
a
life
of
grandeur
all
that
is
needful
to
dazzle
the
unsuspecting
to
throw
dust
in
people
s
eyes
and
to
dupe
one
s
chance
acquaintances
all
these
things
were
provided
without
delay
by
the
month
by
the
day
or
by
the
hour
just
as
the
applicant
pleased
but
there
was
no
such
thing
as
credit
there
bills
were
presented
every
evening
to
those
lodgers
who
did
not
pay
in
advance
and
he
who
could
not
or
would
not
settle
the
score
even
if
he
were
excellency
or
prince
was
requested
to
depart
at
once
and
his
trunks
were
held
as
security
when
fortunat
entered
the
office
of
the
hotel
a
woman
with
a
crafty
looking
face
was
holding
a
conference
with
an
elderly
gentleman
who
had
a
black
velvet
skullcap
on
his
head
and
a
magnifying
glass
in
his
hand
they
applied
their
eyes
to
the
glass
in
turn
and
were
engaged
in
examining
some
very
handsome
diamonds
which
had
no
doubt
been
offered
in
lieu
of
money
by
some
noble
but
impecunious
foreigner
on
hearing
fortunat
enter
the
woman
looked
up
what
do
you
desire
monsieur
she
inquired
politely
i
wish
to
see
madame
lucy
the
woman
did
not
reply
at
first
but
raised
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
as
if
she
were
reading
there
the
list
of
all
the
foreigners
of
distinction
who
honored
the
hotel
de
homburg
by
their
presence
at
that
moment
lucy
huntley
she
repeated
i
don
t
recollect
that
name
i
don
t
think
there
s
such
a
person
in
the
house
lucy
huntley
what
kind
of
a
person
is
she
for
many
reasons
fortunat
could
not
answer
first
of
all
he
did
not
know
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
and
he
avoided
the
question
without
the
slightest
embarrassment
at
the
same
time
trying
to
quicken
the
woman
s
faulty
memory
the
person
i
wished
to
see
was
here
on
friday
between
three
and
six
in
the
afternoon
and
she
was
waiting
for
a
visitor
with
an
anxiety
which
could
not
possibly
have
escaped
your
this
detail
quickened
the
memory
of
the
man
with
the
magnifying
glass
none
other
than
the
woman
s
husband
and
landlord
of
the
hotel
ah
the
gentleman
is
speaking
of
the
lady
of
no
you
remember
the
same
who
insisted
upon
having
the
large
private
to
be
sure
replied
the
wife
where
could
my
wits
have
been
and
turning
to
fortunat
excuse
my
forgetfulness
she
added
the
lady
is
no
longer
in
the
house
she
only
remained
here
for
a
few
this
reply
did
not
surprise
fortunat
he
had
expected
it
and
yet
he
assumed
an
air
of
the
utmost
consternation
only
a
few
hours
he
repeated
like
a
despairing
echo
yes
monsieur
she
arrived
here
about
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
with
only
a
large
valise
by
way
of
luggage
and
she
left
that
same
evening
at
eight
o
alas
and
where
was
she
going
she
didn
t
tell
you
might
have
sworn
that
fortunat
was
about
to
burst
into
tears
poor
lucy
said
he
in
a
tragical
tone
it
was
for
me
madame
that
she
was
waiting
but
it
was
only
this
morning
that
i
received
her
letter
appointing
a
meeting
here
she
must
have
been
in
despair
the
post
can
t
be
depended
on
the
husband
and
wife
simultaneously
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
the
expression
of
their
faces
unmistakably
implied
what
can
we
do
about
it
it
is
no
business
of
ours
don
t
trouble
but
fortunat
was
not
the
man
to
be
dismayed
by
such
a
trifle
she
was
taken
to
the
railway
station
no
doubt
he
insisted
really
i
know
nothing
about
you
told
me
just
now
that
she
had
a
large
valise
so
she
could
not
have
left
your
hotel
on
foot
she
must
have
asked
for
a
vehicle
who
was
sent
to
fetch
it
one
of
your
boys
if
i
could
find
the
driver
i
should
perhaps
be
able
to
obtain
some
valuable
information
from
the
husband
and
wife
exchanged
a
whole
volume
of
suspicions
in
a
single
glance
isidore
fortunat
s
appearance
was
incontestably
respectable
but
they
were
well
aware
that
those
strange
men
styled
detectives
are
perfectly
conversant
with
the
art
of
dressing
to
perfection
so
the
hotelkeeper
quickly
decided
on
his
course
your
idea
is
an
excellent
one
he
said
to
fortunat
this
lady
must
certainly
have
taken
a
vehicle
on
leaving
and
what
is
more
it
must
have
been
a
vehicle
belonging
to
the
hotel
if
you
will
follow
me
we
will
make
some
inquiries
on
the
and
rising
with
a
willingness
that
augured
well
for
their
success
he
led
the
agent
into
the
courtyard
where
five
or
six
vehicles
were
stationed
while
the
drivers
lounged
on
a
bench
chatting
and
smoking
their
pipes
which
of
you
was
employed
by
a
lady
yesterday
evening
at
about
eight
o
clock
what
sort
of
a
person
was
she
she
was
a
handsome
woman
between
thirty
and
forty
years
old
very
fair
rather
stout
and
dressed
in
black
she
had
a
large
i
took
her
answered
one
of
the
drivers
promptly
fortunat
advanced
toward
the
man
with
open
arms
and
with
such
eagerness
that
it
might
have
been
supposed
he
meant
to
embrace
him
ah
my
worthy
fellow
he
exclaimed
you
can
save
my
life
the
driver
looked
exceedingly
pleased
he
was
thinking
that
this
gentleman
would
certainly
requite
his
salvation
by
a
magnificent
gratuity
what
do
you
want
of
me
he
asked
tell
me
where
you
drove
this
lady
i
took
her
to
the
rue
de
to
what
number
ah
i
can
t
tell
i
ve
forgotten
but
fortunat
no
longer
felt
any
anxiety
very
good
said
he
you
ve
forgotten
it
that
s
not
at
all
strange
but
you
would
know
the
house
again
wouldn
t
you
undoubtedly
i
will
you
take
me
there
certainly
sir
this
is
my
the
hunter
of
missing
heirs
at
once
climbed
inside
but
it
was
not
until
the
carriage
had
left
the
courtyard
that
the
landlord
returned
to
his
office
that
man
must
be
a
detective
he
remarked
to
his
wife
so
i
it
s
strange
we
re
not
acquainted
with
him
he
must
be
a
new
member
of
the
but
fortunat
was
quite
indifferent
as
to
what
impression
he
had
left
behind
him
at
the
hotel
de
homburg
for
he
never
expected
to
set
foot
there
again
the
one
essential
thing
was
that
he
had
obtained
the
information
he
wished
for
and
even
a
description
of
the
lady
and
he
felt
that
he
was
now
really
on
the
track
the
vehicle
soon
reached
the
rue
de
berry
and
drew
up
in
front
of
a
charming
little
private
house
here
we
are
monsieur
said
the
driver
bowing
at
the
door
fortunat
sprang
nimbly
on
to
the
pavement
and
handed
five
francs
to
the
coachman
who
went
off
growling
and
swearing
for
he
thought
the
reward
a
contemptibly
small
one
coming
as
it
did
from
a
man
whose
life
had
been
saved
according
to
his
own
confession
however
the
person
the
jehu
anathematized
certainly
did
not
hear
him
standing
motionless
where
he
had
alighted
fortunat
scrutinized
the
house
in
front
of
him
with
close
attention
so
she
lives
here
he
muttered
this
is
the
place
but
i
can
t
present
myself
without
knowing
her
name
i
must
make
some
there
was
a
some
fifty
paces
distant
and
thither
fortunat
hastened
and
ordered
a
glass
of
currant
syrup
as
he
slowly
sipped
the
beverage
he
pointed
to
the
house
in
question
with
an
air
of
indifference
and
asked
whom
does
that
pretty
dwelling
belong
to
to
madame
lia
d
argeles
answered
the
landlady
fortunat
started
he
well
remembered
that
this
was
the
name
the
marquis
de
valorsay
had
mentioned
when
speaking
of
the
vile
conspiracy
he
had
planned
it
was
at
this
woman
s
house
that
the
man
whom
mademoiselle
marguerite
loved
had
been
disgraced
still
he
managed
to
master
his
surprise
and
in
a
light
frank
tone
he
resumed
what
a
pretty
name
and
what
does
this
lady
do
what
does
she
do
why
she
amuses
fortunat
seemed
astonished
dash
it
said
he
she
must
amuse
herself
to
good
purpose
to
have
a
house
like
that
is
she
pretty
that
depends
on
taste
she
s
no
longer
young
at
any
rate
but
she
has
superb
golden
hair
and
oh
how
white
she
is
as
white
as
snow
monsieur
as
white
as
snow
she
has
a
fine
figure
as
well
and
a
most
distinguished
bearing
pays
cash
too
to
the
very
last
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
the
portrait
sketched
by
the
fully
corresponded
with
the
description
given
by
the
hotelkeeper
in
the
rue
de
helder
accordingly
fortunat
drained
his
glass
and
threw
fifty
centimes
on
the
counter
then
crossing
the
street
he
boldly
rang
at
the
door
of
madame
d
argeles
s
house
if
any
one
had
asked
him
what
he
proposed
doing
and
saying
if
he
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance
he
might
have
replied
with
perfect
sincerity
i
don
t
the
fact
is
he
had
but
one
aim
one
settled
purpose
in
his
mind
he
was
obstinately
furiously
resolved
to
derive
some
benefit
small
or
great
from
this
mysterious
affair
as
for
the
means
of
execution
he
relied
entirely
on
his
audacity
and
convinced
that
they
would
not
fail
him
when
the
decisive
moment
came
first
of
all
i
must
see
this
lady
he
said
to
himself
the
first
words
will
depend
solely
upon
my
first
impressions
after
that
i
shall
be
guided
by
an
old
in
a
quiet
tasteful
livery
opened
the
door
whereupon
fortunat
in
a
tone
of
authority
asked
madame
lia
d
argeles
madame
does
not
receive
on
friday
was
the
reply
with
a
petulant
gesture
fortunat
rejoined
all
the
same
i
must
speak
with
her
it
is
on
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
give
her
my
so
saying
he
held
out
a
bit
of
pasteboard
on
which
below
his
name
were
inscribed
the
words
liquidations
settlements
effected
for
insolvent
ah
that
s
a
different
thing
said
the
servant
will
monsieur
take
the
trouble
to
follow
me
fortunat
did
take
the
trouble
and
he
was
conducted
into
a
large
where
he
was
requested
to
sit
down
and
await
madame
s
coming
left
to
himself
he
began
an
inventory
of
the
apartment
as
a
general
studies
the
ground
on
which
he
is
about
to
give
battle
no
trace
remained
of
the
unfortunate
scene
of
the
previous
night
save
a
broken
candelabrum
on
the
it
was
the
one
which
pascal
ferailleur
had
armed
himself
with
when
they
talked
of
searching
him
and
which
he
had
thrown
down
in
the
courtyard
as
he
left
the
house
but
this
detail
did
not
attract
fortunat
s
attention
the
only
thing
that
puzzled
him
was
the
large
reflector
placed
above
the
chandelier
and
it
took
him
some
time
to
fathom
with
what
object
it
was
placed
there
without
precisely
intimidating
him
the
luxurious
appointments
of
the
house
aroused
his
astonishment
everything
here
is
in
princely
style
he
muttered
and
this
shows
that
all
the
lunatics
are
not
at
charenton
yet
if
madame
d
argeles
lacked
bread
in
days
gone
by
she
does
so
no
longer
that
s
naturally
enough
this
reflection
led
him
to
wonder
why
such
a
rich
woman
should
become
the
marquis
de
valorsay
s
accomplice
and
lend
a
hand
in
so
vile
and
cowardly
a
plot
which
horrified
even
him
fortunat
for
she
must
be
an
accomplice
he
thought
and
he
marvelled
at
the
freak
of
fate
which
had
connected
the
unfortunate
man
who
had
been
sacrificed
with
the
unacknowledged
daughter
and
the
sister
of
the
count
de
chalusse
a
vague
presentiment
the
mysterious
voice
of
instinct
warned
him
moreover
that
his
profit
in
the
affair
would
depend
upon
the
antagonism
or
alliance
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
madame
d
argeles
but
his
meditations
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
a
discussion
in
an
adjoining
room
he
stepped
eagerly
forward
hoping
to
hear
something
and
he
did
hear
a
man
saying
in
a
coarse
voice
what
i
leave
an
interesting
game
and
lose
precious
time
in
coming
to
offer
you
my
services
and
you
receive
me
like
this
zounds
madame
this
will
teach
me
not
to
meddle
with
what
doesn
t
concern
me
in
future
so
my
dear
lady
you
ll
learn
some
day
to
your
cost
the
real
nature
of
this
villain
of
a
coralth
whom
you
now
defend
so
this
name
of
coralth
was
also
one
of
those
which
were
engraven
upon
fortunat
s
memory
and
yet
he
did
not
notice
it
at
the
moment
his
attention
was
so
absorbed
by
what
he
had
just
heard
that
he
could
not
fix
his
mind
upon
the
object
of
his
mission
and
he
only
abandoned
his
conjectures
on
hearing
a
rustling
of
skirts
against
the
panels
of
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
the
next
moment
madame
lia
d
argeles
entered
the
room
she
was
arrayed
in
a
very
elegant
of
gray
cashmere
with
blue
satin
trimmings
her
hair
was
beautifully
arranged
and
she
had
neglected
none
of
the
usual
artifices
of
the
still
any
one
would
have
considered
her
to
be
over
forty
years
of
age
her
sad
face
wore
an
expression
of
melancholy
resignation
and
there
were
signs
of
recent
tears
in
her
swollen
eyes
surrounded
by
bluish
circles
she
glanced
at
her
visitor
and
in
anything
but
an
encouraging
tone
exclaimed
you
desired
to
speak
with
me
i
believe
fortunat
bowed
almost
disconcerted
he
had
expected
to
meet
one
of
those
stupid
ignorant
young
women
who
make
themselves
conspicuous
at
the
afternoon
promenade
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
an
evidently
cultivated
and
imperious
woman
who
even
in
her
degradation
retained
all
her
pride
of
race
and
awed
him
despite
all
his
coolness
and
assurance
i
do
indeed
madame
wish
to
confer
with
you
respecting
some
important
interests
he
answered
she
sank
on
to
a
chair
and
without
asking
her
visitor
to
take
a
seat
explain
yourself
she
said
briefly
fortunat
s
knowledge
of
the
importance
of
the
game
in
which
he
had
already
risked
so
much
had
already
restored
his
presence
of
mind
he
had
only
needed
a
glance
to
form
a
true
estimate
of
madame
d
argeles
s
character
and
he
realized
that
it
would
require
a
sudden
powerful
and
blow
to
shatter
her
composure
i
have
the
unpleasant
duty
of
informing
you
of
a
great
misfortune
madame
he
began
a
person
who
is
very
dear
to
you
and
who
is
nearly
related
to
you
was
a
victim
of
a
frightful
accident
yesterday
evening
and
died
this
this
gloomy
preamble
did
not
seem
to
produce
the
slightest
effect
on
madame
d
argeles
whom
are
you
speaking
of
she
coldly
asked
fortunat
assumed
his
most
solemn
manner
as
he
replied
of
your
brother
madame
of
the
count
de
she
sprang
up
and
a
convulsive
shudder
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
raymond
is
dead
she
faltered
alas
yes
madame
struck
with
death
at
the
very
moment
he
was
repairing
to
the
appointment
you
had
given
him
at
the
hotel
de
this
clever
falsehood
which
was
not
entirely
one
would
so
the
agent
thought
be
of
advantage
to
him
since
it
would
prove
he
was
acquainted
with
previous
events
but
madame
d
argeles
did
not
seem
to
notice
or
even
to
hear
the
remark
she
had
fallen
back
in
her
paler
than
death
how
did
he
die
she
asked
from
an
attack
of
my
god
exclaimed
the
wretched
woman
who
now
suspected
the
truth
my
god
forgive
me
it
was
my
letter
that
killed
him
and
she
wept
as
if
her
heart
were
breaking
this
woman
who
had
suffered
and
wept
so
much
it
is
needless
to
say
that
fortunat
was
moved
with
sympathy
he
always
evinced
a
respectful
sympathy
for
the
woes
of
others
but
in
the
present
instance
his
emotion
was
greatly
mitigated
by
the
satisfaction
he
felt
at
having
succeeded
so
quickly
and
so
completely
madame
d
argeles
had
confessed
everything
this
was
indeed
a
victory
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
had
trembled
lest
she
should
deny
all
and
bid
him
leave
the
house
he
still
saw
many
difficulties
between
his
pocket
and
the
count
de
chalusse
s
money
but
he
did
not
despair
of
conquering
them
after
such
a
successful
beginning
and
he
was
muttering
some
words
of
consolation
when
madame
d
argeles
suddenly
looked
up
and
said
i
must
see
him
i
will
see
him
once
more
come
monsieur
but
a
terrible
memory
rooted
her
to
the
spot
and
with
a
despairing
gesture
and
in
a
voice
quivering
with
anguish
she
exclaimed
no
no
i
can
not
even
do
fortunat
was
not
a
little
disturbed
and
it
was
with
a
look
of
something
very
like
consternation
that
he
glanced
at
madame
d
argeles
who
had
reseated
herself
and
was
now
sobbing
violently
with
her
face
hidden
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
what
prevents
her
he
thought
why
this
sudden
terror
now
that
her
brother
is
dead
is
she
unwilling
to
confess
that
she
is
a
chalusse
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
it
however
if
she
wishes
to
receive
the
count
s
property
and
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
it
for
my
sake
if
not
for
her
he
remained
silent
until
it
seemed
to
him
that
madame
d
argeles
was
calmer
then
excuse
me
madame
he
began
for
breaking
in
upon
your
very
natural
grief
but
duty
requires
me
to
remind
you
of
your
with
the
passive
docility
of
those
who
are
wretched
she
wiped
away
her
tears
and
replied
gently
i
am
listening
he
had
had
time
to
prepare
his
discourse
first
of
all
madame
he
remarked
i
must
tell
you
that
i
was
the
count
s
confidential
agent
in
him
i
lose
a
protector
respect
alone
prevents
me
from
saying
a
friend
he
had
no
secrets
from
fortunat
saw
so
plainly
that
madame
d
argeles
did
not
understand
a
word
of
this
sentimental
exordium
that
he
thought
it
necessary
to
add
i
tell
you
this
not
so
much
to
gain
your
consideration
and
as
to
explain
to
you
how
i
became
acquainted
with
these
matters
relating
to
your
family
how
i
became
aware
of
your
existence
for
instance
which
no
one
else
he
paused
hoping
for
some
reply
a
word
a
sign
but
not
receiving
this
encouragement
he
continued
i
must
first
of
all
call
your
attention
to
the
peculiar
situation
of
de
chalusse
and
to
the
circumstances
which
immediately
preceded
and
attended
his
departure
from
life
his
death
was
so
unexpected
that
he
was
unable
to
make
any
disposition
of
his
property
by
will
or
even
to
indicate
his
last
wishes
this
madame
is
fortunate
for
you
de
chalusse
had
certain
prejudices
against
you
as
you
are
aware
poor
count
he
certainly
had
the
best
heart
in
the
world
and
yet
hatred
with
him
was
almost
barbaric
in
its
intensity
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
had
determined
to
deprive
you
of
your
inheritance
with
this
intention
he
had
already
begun
to
convert
his
estates
into
ready
money
and
had
he
lived
six
months
longer
you
would
not
have
received
a
with
a
gesture
of
indifference
which
was
difficult
to
explain
after
the
vehemence
and
the
threatening
tone
of
her
letter
madame
d
argeles
murmured
ah
well
what
does
it
matter
what
does
it
matter
repeated
fortunat
i
see
madame
that
your
grief
prevents
you
from
realizing
the
extent
of
the
peril
you
have
escaped
de
chalusse
had
other
and
more
powerful
reasons
even
than
his
hatred
for
wishing
to
deprive
you
of
your
share
of
his
property
he
had
sworn
that
he
would
give
a
princely
fortune
to
his
beloved
for
the
first
time
madame
d
argeles
s
features
assumed
an
expression
of
surprise
what
my
brother
had
a
child
yes
madame
an
illegitimate
daughter
mademoiselle
marguerite
a
lovely
and
charming
girl
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
restoring
to
his
care
some
years
ago
she
has
been
living
with
him
for
six
months
or
so
and
he
was
about
to
marry
her
with
an
enormous
dowry
to
a
nobleman
bearing
one
of
the
proudest
names
in
france
the
marquis
de
the
name
shook
madame
d
argeles
as
if
she
had
experienced
the
shock
of
an
electric
battery
and
springing
to
her
feet
with
flashing
eyes
you
say
that
my
brother
s
daughter
was
to
marry
de
valorsay
she
asked
it
was
decided
the
marquis
adored
but
she
she
did
not
love
him
confess
that
she
did
not
love
fortunat
did
not
know
what
to
reply
the
question
took
him
completely
by
surprise
and
feeling
that
his
answer
would
have
a
very
considerable
influence
upon
what
might
follow
he
hesitated
will
you
answer
me
insisted
madame
d
argeles
imperiously
she
loved
another
did
she
not
to
tell
the
truth
i
believe
she
did
the
agent
stammered
but
i
have
no
proof
of
it
ah
the
wretch
she
exclaimed
with
a
threatening
gesture
the
traitor
the
infamous
scoundrel
now
i
understand
it
all
and
to
think
that
it
occurred
in
my
house
but
no
it
was
best
so
i
can
still
repair
and
darting
to
the
she
pulled
it
violently
a
servant
at
once
appeared
job
she
said
hasten
after
baron
trigault
he
left
the
house
a
moment
ago
and
bring
him
back
i
must
speak
with
him
if
you
do
not
overtake
him
go
to
his
club
to
his
house
to
the
houses
of
his
friends
go
to
every
place
where
there
is
any
chance
of
finding
him
make
haste
and
do
not
return
without
and
as
the
man
turned
to
obey
she
added
my
carriage
must
be
in
the
courtyard
take
meanwhile
fortunat
s
expression
of
countenance
had
undergone
a
marked
change
well
thought
he
i
have
just
made
a
mess
of
it
valorsay
is
unmasked
and
now
may
i
be
hung
if
he
ever
marries
mademoiselle
marguerite
certainly
i
do
not
owe
much
to
the
scoundrel
for
he
has
defrauded
me
of
forty
thousand
francs
but
what
will
he
say
when
he
discovers
what
i
ve
done
he
will
never
believe
me
if
i
tell
him
that
it
was
an
involuntary
blunder
and
heaven
only
knows
what
revenge
he
will
plan
a
man
of
his
disposition
knowing
that
he
is
ruined
is
capable
of
anything
so
much
the
worse
for
me
before
night
i
shall
warn
the
commissary
of
police
in
my
district
and
i
shall
not
go
out
unarmed
the
servant
went
off
and
madame
d
argeles
then
turned
to
her
visitor
again
but
she
seemed
literally
transfigured
by
the
storm
of
passion
which
was
raging
in
her
heart
and
mind
her
cheeks
were
crimson
and
an
unwonted
energy
sparkled
in
her
eyes
let
us
finish
this
business
she
said
curtly
i
am
expecting
some
fortunat
bowed
with
a
rather
pompous
but
at
the
same
time
obsequious
air
i
have
only
a
few
more
words
to
say
he
declared
m
de
chalusse
having
no
other
heir
i
have
come
to
acquaint
you
with
your
very
good
continue
if
you
you
have
only
to
present
yourself
and
establish
your
identity
to
be
put
in
possession
of
your
brother
s
madame
d
argeles
gave
the
agent
a
look
of
mingled
irony
and
distrust
and
after
a
moment
s
reflection
she
replied
i
am
very
grateful
for
your
interest
monsieur
but
if
i
have
any
rights
it
is
not
my
intention
to
urge
it
seemed
to
fortunat
as
if
he
were
suddenly
falling
from
some
immense
height
you
are
not
in
earnest
he
exclaimed
or
you
are
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
de
chalusse
leaves
perhaps
twenty
millions
behind
my
course
is
decided
on
monsieur
irrevocably
decided
very
well
madame
but
it
often
happens
that
the
court
institutes
inquiries
for
the
heirs
of
large
fortunes
and
this
may
happen
in
your
i
should
reply
that
i
was
not
a
member
of
the
chalusse
family
and
that
would
end
it
startled
by
the
news
of
my
brother
s
death
i
allowed
my
secret
to
escape
me
i
shall
know
how
to
keep
it
in
anger
succeeded
astonishment
in
fortunat
s
mind
madame
madame
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
he
cried
impetuously
accept
in
heaven
s
name
accept
this
inheritance
if
not
for
yourself
for
the
sake
of
in
his
excitement
he
was
about
to
commit
a
terrible
blunder
he
saw
it
in
time
and
checked
himself
for
the
sake
of
whom
asked
madame
d
argeles
in
an
altered
voice
for
the
sake
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
madame
for
the
sake
of
this
poor
child
who
is
your
niece
the
count
never
having
acknowledged
her
as
his
daughter
she
will
be
left
actually
without
bread
while
her
father
s
millions
go
to
enrich
the
that
will
suffice
monsieur
i
will
think
of
it
and
now
enough
the
dismissal
was
so
imperious
that
fortunat
bowed
and
went
off
completely
bewildered
by
this
denouement
she
s
crazy
he
said
to
himself
crazy
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
she
refuses
the
count
s
millions
from
a
silly
fear
of
telling
people
that
she
belongs
to
the
chalusse
family
she
threatened
her
brother
but
she
would
never
have
carried
her
threats
into
execution
and
she
prefers
her
present
position
to
such
a
fortune
what
lunacy
but
although
he
was
disappointed
and
angry
he
did
not
by
any
means
despair
fortunately
for
me
he
thought
this
proud
and
haughty
lady
has
a
son
somewhere
in
the
world
and
she
ll
do
for
him
what
she
would
not
consent
to
do
for
herself
through
her
with
a
little
patience
and
victor
chupin
s
aid
i
shall
succeed
in
discovering
this
boy
he
must
be
an
intelligent
youth
and
we
ll
see
if
he
surrenders
his
millions
as
easily
as
his
mamma
xvi
it
is
a
terrible
task
to
break
suddenly
with
one
s
past
without
even
having
had
time
for
preparation
to
renounce
the
life
one
has
so
far
lived
to
return
to
the
starting
point
and
begin
existence
anew
to
abandon
everything
the
position
one
has
gained
the
work
one
has
become
familiar
with
every
fondly
cherished
hope
and
friend
and
habit
to
forsake
the
known
to
plunge
into
the
unknown
to
leave
the
certain
for
the
uncertain
and
desert
light
for
darkness
to
cast
one
s
identity
aside
assume
a
strange
individuality
become
a
living
lie
change
name
position
face
and
clothes
in
one
phrase
to
cease
to
be
one
s
self
in
order
to
become
some
one
else
this
is
indeed
a
terrible
ordeal
and
requires
an
amount
of
resolution
and
energy
which
few
human
beings
possess
the
boldest
hesitate
before
such
a
sacrifice
and
many
a
man
has
surrendered
himself
to
justice
rather
than
resort
to
this
last
extremity
and
yet
this
was
what
pascal
ferailleur
had
the
courage
to
do
on
the
morrow
of
the
shameful
conspiracy
that
had
deprived
him
of
his
good
name
when
his
mother
s
exhortations
and
baron
trigault
s
encouraging
words
had
restored
his
wonted
clearness
of
perception
the
only
course
he
felt
disposed
to
pursue
was
to
disappear
and
fly
from
the
storm
of
slander
and
contempt
and
then
in
a
secure
to
watch
for
the
time
and
opportunity
of
rehabilitation
and
revenge
madame
ferailleur
and
her
son
made
all
needful
arrangements
i
shall
start
out
at
once
said
pascal
and
before
two
hours
have
elapsed
i
shall
have
found
a
modest
lodging
where
we
must
conceal
ourselves
for
the
present
i
know
a
locality
that
will
suit
us
and
where
no
one
will
certainly
ever
think
of
looking
for
and
i
asked
madame
ferailleur
what
shall
i
do
in
the
meantime
you
mother
you
must
at
once
sell
all
that
we
possess
here
everything
even
my
books
you
will
only
keep
such
of
our
linen
and
clothes
as
you
can
pack
in
three
or
four
trunks
we
are
undoubtedly
watched
and
so
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
every
one
should
imagine
i
have
left
paris
and
that
you
are
going
to
join
and
when
everything
is

the
western
railway
station

next
very
good
i
will
do
so
even
if
any
one
is
watching
us
he
won
t
be
likely
to
suspect
this
ruse
but
afterward
afterward

the

messenger

the
receipt

railway
people

give
you
to
fetch

luggage
for
madame
ferailleur
approved
of
this
plan
deeming
herself
fortunate
in
this
great
calamity
that
despair
had
not
destroyed
her
son
s
energy
and
resources
of
mind
shall
we
retain
our
name
pascal
oh
no
that
would
be
an
unpardonable
what
name
shall
we
take
then
i
must
know
for
they
may
ask
me
at
the
he
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
said
we
ll
take
your
maiden
name
mother
it
will
bring
us
good
luck
our
new
lodgings
shall
be
hired
in
the
name
of
the
widow
they
talked
for
some
time
longer
anxious
to
take
every
precaution
that
prudence
could
suggest
and
when
they
were
convinced
that
they
had
forgotten
nothing
madame
ferailleur
suggested
that
pascal
should
start
off
but
before
doing
so
he
had
a
sacred
duty
to
perform
i
must
warn
marguerite
he
muttered
and
seating
himself
at
his
desk
he
wrote
his
beloved
a
concise
and
exact
account
of
the
events
which
had
taken
place
he
told
her
of
the
course
he
intended
to
pursue
and
promised
her
that
she
should
know
his
new
abode
as
soon
as
he
knew
it
himself
in
conclusion
he
entreated
her
to
grant
him
an
interview
in
which
he
could
give
her
the
full
particulars
of
the
affair
and
acquaint
her
with
his
hopes
as
for
exculpating
himself
even
by
so
much
as
a
single
word
as
for
explaining
the
snare
he
had
been
the
victim
of
the
idea
never
once
occurred
to
him
he
was
worthy
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
he
knew
that
not
a
doubt
would
disturb
the
perfect
faith
she
had
in
his
honor
leaning
over
her
son
s
shoulder
madame
ferailleur
read
what
he
had
written
do
you
intend
to
trust
this
letter
to
the
post
she
inquired
are
you
sure
perfectly
sure
that
it
will
reach
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
not
some
one
else
who
might
use
it
against
you
pascal
shook
his
head
i
know
how
to
insure
its
safe
receipt
he
replied
some
time
ago
marguerite
told
me
that
if
ever
any
great
peril
threatened
us
i
might
call
for
the
housekeeper
at
the
chalusse
mansion
and
intrust
my
message
to
her
the
danger
is
sufficiently
great
to
justify
such
a
course
in
the
present
instance
so
i
shall
pass
down
the
rue
de
courcelles
ask
to
see
madame
leon
and
give
her
this
letter
have
no
fear
my
dear
as
he
spoke
he
began
to
pack
all
the
legal
documents
which
had
been
confided
to
him
into
a
large
box
which
was
to
be
carried
to
one
of
his
former
friends
who
would
distribute
the
papers
among
the
people
they
belonged
to
he
next
made
a
small
bundle
of
the
few
important
private
papers
and
valuables
he
possessed
and
then
ready
for
the
sacrifice
he
took
a
last
survey
of
the
pleasant
home
where
success
had
smiled
so
favorably
upon
his
efforts
where
he
had
been
so
happy
and
where
he
had
cherished
such
bright
dreams
of
the
future
overcome
by
a
flood
of
recollections
the
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
he
embraced
his
mother
and
fled
precipitately
from
the
house
poor
child
murmured
madame
ferailleur
poor
pascal
was
she
not
also
to
be
pitied
this
was
the
second
time
within
twenty
years
that
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
on
her
in
the
full
sunlight
of
happiness
and
yet
now
as
on
the
day
following
her
husband
s
death
she
found
in
her
heart
the
robust
energy
and
heroic
maternal
constancy
which
enable
one
to
rise
above
every
misfortune
it
was
in
a
firm
voice
that
she
ordered
her
servant
to
go
in
search
of
the
nearest
furniture
dealer
no
matter
which
provided
he
would
pay
cash
and
when
the
man
arrived
she
showed
him
through
the
rooms
with
stoical
calmness
god
alone
knew
how
intensely
she
was
suffering
and
yet
while
she
was
waiting
for
the
dealer
each
piece
of
furniture
had
acquired
an
extraordinary
value
in
her
eyes
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
each
object
were
a
part
of
herself
and
when
the
man
turned
and
twisted
a
chair
or
a
table
she
almost
considered
it
a
personal
affront
the
rich
who
are
accustomed
from
birth
to
the
luxury
that
surrounds
them
are
ignorant
of
the
terrible
sufferings
which
attend
such
cases
as
these
the
persons
who
do
suffer
are
those
of
the
middle
classes
not
the
parvenus
but
those
who
bid
fair
to
become
parvenus
when
misfortune
overtook
them
their
hearts
bleed
when
inexorable
necessity
deprives
them
of
all
the
little
comforts
with
which
they
had
gradually
surrounded
themselves
for
there
is
not
an
object
that
does
not
recall
a
long
ungratified
desire
and
the
almost
infantile
joy
of
possession
what
happiness
they
felt
on
the
day
when
they
purchased
that
large
how
many
times
they
had
gone
to
admire
those
velvet
curtains
in
the
shop
windows
before
buying
them
those
carpets
represented
months
of
and
that
pretty
clock
ah
they
had
fancied
it
would
only
herald
the
flight
of
prosperous
and
pleasant
hours
and
all
these
things
the
dealer
handles
and
shakes
and
jeers
at
and
depreciates
he
will
scarcely
condescend
to
purchase
who
would
care
to
buy
such
trash
he
knows
that
the
owner
is
in
need
of
money
and
he
profits
by
this
knowledge
it
is
his
business
how
much
did
this
cost
you
he
asks
as
he
inspects
one
piece
of
furniture
after
another
so
well
you
must
have
been
terribly
you
know
very
well
that
if
there
is
a
cheat
in
the
world
it
is
this
same
man
but
what
can
you
say
any
other
dealer
you
might
send
for
would
act
in
the
same
way
now
madame
ferailleur
s
furniture
had
cost
some
ten
thousand
francs
and
although
it
was
no
longer
new
it
was
worth
at
least
a
third
of
that
sum
but
she
obtained
only
seven
hundred
and
sixty
francs
for
it
it
is
true
however
that
she
was
in
haste
and
that
she
was
paid
cash
nine
o
clock
was
striking
when
her
trunks
were
at
last
piled
on
a
cab
and
she
called
out
to
the
driver
take
me
to
the
place
du
havre
to
the
railway
once
before
when
defrauded
by
a
scoundrel
she
had
been
obliged
to
part
with
all
her
household
treasures
once
before
she
had
left
her
home
taking
merely
the
wreck
of
her
fortune
with
her
but
what
a
difference
between
then
and
now
then
the
esteem
and
sympathy
of
all
who
knew
her
was
hers
and
the
admiring
praise
she
received
divested
the
sacrifice
of
much
of
its
bitterness
and
increased
her
courage
now
she
was
flying
secretly
and
alone
under
an
assumed
name
trembling
at
the
thought
of
pursuit
or
recognition
flying
as
a
criminal
flies
at
thought
of
his
crime
and
fear
of
punishment
she
had
far
less
suffered
on
the
day
when
with
her
son
upon
her
knees
she
journeyed
to
the
cemetery
following
all
that
was
mortal
of
the
man
who
had
been
her
only
thought
her
love
her
pride
her
happiness
and
hope
though
crushed
by
the
sense
of
her
irreparable
loss
she
had
not
rebelled
against
the
hand
that
struck
her
but
now
it
was
human
wickedness
that
assailed
her
through
her
son
and
her
suffering
was
like
that
of
the
innocent
man
who
perishes
for
want
of
power
to
prove
his
innocence
her
husband
s
death
had
not
caused
her
such
bitter
tears
as
her
son
s
dishonor
she
who
was
so
proud
and
who
had
such
good
reason
to
be
proud
she
could
note
the
glances
of
scorn
she
was
favored
with
as
she
left
her
home
she
heard
the
insulting
remarks
made
by
some
of
her
neighbors
who
like
so
many
folks
found
their
chief
delight
in
other
people
s
misfortunes
crocodile
tears
some
had
exclaimed
she
is
going
to
meet
her
son
and
with
what
he
has
stolen
they
will
live
like
princes
in
rumor
which
enlarges
and
misrepresents
everything
had
indeed
absurdly
exaggerated
the
affair
at
madame
d
argeles
s
house
it
was
reported
in
the
rue
d
ulm
that
pascal
had
spent
every
night
at
the
gaming
table
for
more
than
five
years
and
that
being
an
incomparable
trickster
he
had
stolen
millions
meanwhile
madame
ferailleur
was
approaching
the
station
the
cab
horse
soon
slackened
its
pace
to
climb
the
acclivity
of
the
rue
d
amsterdam
and
shortly
afterward
the
vehicle
drew
up
in
the
courtyard
of
the
railway
station
faithfully
observing
the
directions
which
had
been
given
her
the
worthy
woman
had
her
trunks
taken
to
the
declaring
that
she
should
not
leave
paris
until
the
next
day
whereupon
she
received
a
receipt
from
the
man
in
charge
of
the
room
she
was
oppressed
by
vague
apprehensions
and
looked
closely
at
every
one
who
passed
her
fearing
the
presence
of
spies
and
knowing
full
well
that
the
most
profound
secrecy
could
alone
insure
the
success
of
pascal
s
plans
however
she
did
not
see
a
single
suspicious
looking
person
some
englishmen
those
strange
travellers
who
are
at
the
same
time
so
foolishly
prodigal
and
so
ridiculously
miserly
were
making
a
great
hue
and
cry
over
the
four
sous
gratuity
claimed
by
a
poor
commissionaire
but
these
were
the
only
persons
in
sight
partially
reassured
madame
ferailleur
hastily
ascended
the
staircase
and
entered
the
large
it
was
here
that
pascal
had
promised
to
meet
her
but
though
she
looked
round
on
all
sides
she
did
not
perceive
him
still
this
delay
did
not
alarm
her
much
nor
was
it
at
all
strange
since
pascal
had
scarcely
known
what
he
would
have
to
do
when
he
left
the
house
she
seated
herself
on
a
bench
as
far
back
in
the
shade
as
possible
and
gazed
sadly
at
the
throng
when
all
of
a
sudden
she
was
startled
by
a
man
who
abruptly
paused
in
front
of
her
this
man
proved
to
be
pascal
but
his
hair
had
been
closely
cut
and
he
had
shaved
off
his
beard
and
thus
shorn
with
his
smooth
face
and
with
a
brown
silk
neckerchief
in
lieu
of
the
white
muslin
tie
he
usually
wore
he
was
so
greatly
changed
that
for
an
instant
his
own
mother
did
not
recognize
him
well
asked
madame
ferailleur
as
she
realized
his
identity
i
have
succeeded
we
have
secured
such
rooms
as
i
wished
where
ah
a
long
way
off
my
poor
mother
many
a
league
from
those
we
have
known
and
loved
in
a
thinly
populated
part
of
the
suburbs
on
the
route
de
la
revolte
just
outside
the
fortifications
and
almost
at
the
point
where
it
intersects
the
asnieres
road
you
will
not
be
very
comfortable
there
but
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
a
little
she
rose
summoning
all
her
energy
what
does
it
matter
where
or
what
our
abode
is
she
interrupted
with
forced
gayety
i
am
confident
that
we
shall
not
remain
there
but
it
seemed
as
if
her
son
did
not
share
her
hopes
for
he
remained
silent
and
dejected
and
as
his
mother
observed
him
closely
she
fancied
by
the
expression
of
his
eyes
that
some
new
anxiety
had
been
added
to
all
his
other
troubles
what
is
the
matter
she
inquired
unable
to
master
her
alarm
what
has
happened
ah
a
great
misfortune
my
god
still
another
i
have
been
to
the
rue
de
courcelles
and
i
have
spoken
to
madame
what
did
she
say
the
count
de
chalusse
died
this
madame
ferailleur
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
greatly
relieved
she
was
certainly
expecting
to
hear
something
very
different
and
she
did
not
understand
why
this
death
should
be
a
great
misfortune
to
them
personally
one
point
however
she
did
realize
that
it
was
imprudent
and
even
dangerous
to
carry
on
this
conversation
in
a
hall
where
a
hundred
persons
were
passing
and
repassing
every
minute
so
she
took
her
son
s
arm
and
led
him
away
saying
come
let
us
pascal
had
kept
the
cab
which
he
had
been
using
during
the
afternoon
and
having
installed
his
mother
inside
he
got
in
himself
and
gave
his
new
address
to
the
driver
now
tell
me
all
said
madame
ferailleur
poor
pascal
was
in
that
state
of
mind
in
which
it
costs
one
actual
suffering
to
talk
but
he
wished
to
mitigate
his
mother
s
anxiety
as
much
as
possible
and
moreover
he
did
not
like
her
to
suppose
him
wanting
in
endurance
so
with
a
powerful
effort
he
shook
off
the
lethargy
that
was
creeping
over
him
and
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
above
the
noise
of
the
carriage
wheels
he
began
this
is
what
i
have
done
mother
since
i
left
you
i
remembered
that
some
time
ago
while
i
was
appraising
some
property
i
had
seen
three
or
four
houses
on
the
route
de
la
revolte
admirably
suited
to
our
present
wants
naturally
i
went
there
first
a
suite
of
rooms
was
vacant
in
one
of
these
houses
i
have
taken
it
and
in
order
that
nothing
may
interfere
with
the
liberty
of
my
movements
i
have
paid
six
months
rent
in
advance
here
is
the
receipt
drawn
up
in
the
name
we
shall
henceforth
so
saying
he
showed
his
mother
a
document
in
which
the
landlord
declared
that
he
had
received
from
maumejan
the
sum
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
francs
for
two
quarters
rent
etc
my
bargain
concluded
he
resumed
i
returned
into
paris
and
entered
the
first
furniture
shop
i
saw
i
meant
to
hire
the
necessary
things
to
furnish
our
little
home
but
the
dealer
made
all
sorts
of
objections
he
trembled
for
his
furniture
he
wanted
a
sum
of
money
to
be
deposited
as
security
or
the
guarantee
of
three
responsible
business
men
seeing
this
and
knowing
that
i
had
no
time
to
lose
i
preferred
to
purchase
such
articles
as
were
absolutely
necessary
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
purchase
was
that
everything
should
be
in
the
house
and
in
its
place
by
eleven
o
clock
as
i
stipulated
in
writing
that
the
dealer
should
forfeit
three
hundred
francs
in
case
he
failed
to
fulfil
his
agreement
i
can
rely
upon
his
punctuality
i
confided
the
key
of
our
lodgings
to
him
and
he
must
now
be
there
waiting
for
so
before
thinking
of
his
love
and
mademoiselle
marguerite
pascal
had
taken
the
necessary
measures
for
the
execution
of
his
plan
to
regain
his
lost
honor
madame
ferailleur
had
scarcely
supposed
him
capable
of
so
much
courage
and
firmness
and
she
rewarded
him
with
a
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
then
as
he
was
silent
when
did
you
see
madame
leon
then
she
asked
when
all
the
household
arrangements
were
completed
mother
on
leaving
the
i
found
that
i
had
still
an
hour
and
a
quarter
before
me
i
could
defer
no
longer
and
at
the
risk
of
obliging
you
to
wait
for
me
i
hastened
to
the
rue
de
it
was
evident
that
pascal
felt
extreme
embarrassment
in
speaking
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
there
is
an
instinctive
delicacy
and
dislike
of
publicity
in
all
deep
passion
and
true
and
chaste
love
is
ever
averse
to
laying
aside
the
veil
with
which
it
conceals
itself
from
the
inquisitive
madame
ferailleur
understood
this
feeling
but
she
was
a
mother
and
as
such
jealous
of
her
son
s
tenderness
and
anxious
for
particulars
concerning
this
rival
who
had
suddenly
usurped
her
place
in
the
heart
where
she
had
long
reigned
supreme
she
was
also
a
woman
that
is
to
say
distrustful
and
suspicious
in
reference
to
all
other
women
so
without
taking
pity
on
pascal
s
embarrassment
she
urged
him
to
continue
i
gave
the
driver
five
francs
on
condition
that
he
would
hurry
his
horses
he
resumed
and
we
were
rattling
along
at
a
rapid
rate
when
suddenly
near
the
hotel
de
chalusse
i
noticed
a
change
in
the
motion
of
the
vehicle
i
looked
out
and
saw
that
we
were
driving
over
a
thick
layer
of
straw
which
had
been
spread
across
the
street
i
can
scarcely
describe
my
feelings
on
seeing
this
a
cold
perspiration
came
over
me
i
fancied
i
saw
marguerite
in
agony
dying
far
from
me
and
calling
me
in
vain
without
waiting
for
the
vehicle
to
stop
i
sprang
to
the
ground
and
was
obliged
to
exercise
all
my
to
prevent
myself
from
rushing
into
the
concierge
s
lodge
and
wildly
asking
who
is
dying
here
but
an
unforeseen
difficulty
presented
itself
it
was
evident
that
i
ought
not
to
go
in
person
to
inquire
for
madame
leon
whom
could
i
send
there
were
no
commissionaires
at
the
street
corners
and
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
confide
the
message
to
any
of
the
lads
in
the
neighboring
fortunately
my
driver
the
same
who
is
driving
us
now
is
an
obliging
fellow
and
i
intrusted
him
with
the
commission
while
i
stood
guard
over
his
horses
ten
minutes
later
madame
leon
left
the
house
and
came
to
meet
me
i
knew
her
at
once
for
i
had
seen
her
a
hundred
times
with
marguerite
when
they
lived
near
the
luxembourg
and
having
seen
me
pass
and
repass
so
often
she
recognized
me
in
spite
of
my
changed
appearance
her
first
words
m
de
chalusse
is
dead
relieved
my
heart
of
a
terrible
weight
i
could
breathe
again
but
she
was
in
such
haste
that
she
could
not
stop
to
tell
me
any
particulars
still
i
gave
her
my
letter
and
she
promised
me
a
prompt
reply
from
marguerite
everybody
will
be
up
and
moving
about
the
house
and
she
said
she
could
easily
make
her
escape
for
a
few
moments
so
at
twelve
she
will
be
at
the
little
garden
gate
and
if
i
am
promptly
at
hand
i
shall
have
a
reply
from
madame
ferailleur
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
more
and
as
pascal
remained
silent
she
remarked
you
spoke
of
a
great
misfortune
in
what
does
it
consist
i
do
not
perceive
with
an
almost
threatening
gesture
and
in
a
gloomy
voice
he
answered
the
misfortune
is
this
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
abominable
conspiracy
which
has
dishonored
me
marguerite
would
have
been
my
wife
before
a
month
had
elapsed
for
now
she
is
free
absolutely
free
to
obey
the
dictates
of
her
own
will
and
then
why
do
you
complain
oh
mother
don
t
you
understand
how
can
i
marry
her
would
it
be
right
for
me
to
think
of
offering
her
a
dishonored
name
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
be
guilty
of
a
most
contemptible
act
of
something
even
worse
than
a
crime
if
i
dared
speak
to
her
of
my
love
and
our
future
before
i
have
crushed
the
villains
who
have
ruined
regret
anger
and
the
consciousness
of
his
present
powerlessness
drew
from
him
tears
which
fell
upon
madame
ferailleur
s
heart
like
molten
lead
but
she
succeeded
in
concealing
her
agony
all
the
more
reason
she
answered
almost
coldly
why
you
should
not
lose
a
second
but
devote
all
your
energy
and
intelligence
to
the
work
of
oh
i
shall
have
my
revenge
never
fear
but
in
the
meantime
what
is
to
become
of
her
think
mother
she
is
alone
in
the
world
without
a
single
friend
it
is
enough
to
drive
one
mad
she
loves
you
you
tell
me
what
have
you
to
fear
now
she
will
be
freed
from
the
persecutions
of
the
suitor
they
intended
to
force
upon
her
whom
she
has
spoken
to
you
about
the
marquis
de
valorsay
is
it
not
this
name
sent
pascal
s
blood
to
his
brain
ah
the
scoundrel
he
exclaimed
if
there
was
a
god
in
heaven
wretched
boy
interrupted
madame
ferailleur
you
blaspheme
when
providence
has
already
interposed
on
your
behalf
and
who
suffers
most
at
this
moment
do
you
think
you
strong
in
your
innocence
or
the
marquis
who
realizes
that
he
has
committed
an
infamous
crime
in
vain
the
sudden
stopping
of
the
cab
put
an
end
to
their
conversation
leaving
the
route
d
asnieres
the
driver
had
turned
into
the
route
de
la
revolte
and
had
drawn
up
in
front
of
an
unpretentious
house
which
stood
entirely
alone
we
have
arrived
mother
said
pascal
a
man
who
was
standing
on
the
threshold
stepped
forward
to
open
the
cab
door
it
was
the
here
you
are
at
last
maumejan
said
he
come
in
and
you
ll
see
that
i
ve
strictly
fulfilled
the
conditions
of
our
his
words
proved
true
he
was
paid
the
sum
stipulated
and
went
away
satisfied
now
my
dear
mother
said
pascal
allow
me
to
do
the
honors
of
the
poor
abode
i
have
he
had
taken
only
the
ground
floor
of
this
humble
dwelling
the
story
above
which
had
an
independent
entrance
and
staircase
was
occupied
by
the
quiet
family
of
the
owner
although
the
space
was
small
the
architect
had
made
the
most
of
it
he
had
divided
it
into
four
small
rooms
separated
by
a
corridor
and
the
kitchen
looked
out
upon
a
little
garden
about
four
times
as
large
as
an
ordinary
sheet
the
furniture
which
pascal
had
purchased
was
more
than
plain
but
it
was
well
suited
to
this
humble
abode
it
had
just
been
brought
in
but
any
one
would
have
supposed
it
had
been
in
its
place
for
a
couple
of
years
we
shall
be
very
comfortable
here
declared
madame
ferailleur
yes
very
comfortable
by
evening
you
won
t
recognize
the
place
i
have
saved
a
few
trifles
from
the
wreck
some
curtains
a
couple
of
lamps
a
clock
you
ll
see
it
s
wonderful
how
much
four
trunks
can
be
made
to
when
his
mother
set
him
such
a
noble
example
pascal
would
have
blushed
to
allow
himself
to
be
outdone
he
very
quietly
explained
the
reasons
which
had
influenced
him
in
choosing
these
rooms
the
principal
one
being
that
there
was
no
concierge
and
he
was
therefore
assured
absolute
liberty
in
his
movements
as
well
as
entire
immunity
from
indiscreet
gossip
certainly
my
dear
mother
he
added
it
is
a
lonely
and
unattractive
neighborhood
but
you
will
find
all
the
necessaries
of
life
near
at
hand
the
owner
of
the
house
lives
on
the
floor
above
i
have
talked
with
the
wife
they
seem
to
be
honest
quiet
people
and
she
will
pilot
you
about
i
inquired
for
some
one
to
do
the
heavy
work
and
she
mentioned
a
poor
woman
named
vantrasson
who
lives
in
the
neighborhood
and
who
is
anxious
to
obtain
employment
they
were
to
inform
her
this
evening
and
you
will
see
her
and
above
all
don
t
forget
that
you
are
henceforth
madame
occupied
with
these
arrangements
for
the
future
he
was
still
talking
when
madame
ferailleur
drawing
out
her
watch
gently
remarked
and
your
appointment
you
forget
that
the
cab
is
waiting
at
the
it
was
true
he
had
forgotten
it
he
caught
up
his
hat
hastily
embraced
his
mother
and
sprang
into
the
vehicle
the
horses
were
almost
exhausted
but
the
driver
was
so
willing
that
he
found
a
means
of
making
them
trot
as
far
as
the
rue
de
courcelles
however
on
arriving
there
he
declared
that
his
animals
and
himself
could
endure
no
more
and
after
receiving
the
amount
due
to
him
he
departed
the
air
was
chilly
the
night
dark
and
the
street
deserted
the
gloomy
silence
was
only
disturbed
at
long
intervals
by
the
opening
or
shutting
of
a
door
or
by
the
distant
tread
of
some
belated
pedestrian
having
at
least
twenty
minutes
to
wait
pascal
sat
down
on
the
curbstone
opposite
the
hotel
de
chalusse
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
building
as
if
he
were
striving
to
penetrate
the
massive
walls
and
see
what
was
passing
within
only
one
window
that
of
the
room
where
the
dead
man
was
lying
was
lighted
up
and
he
could
vaguely
distinguish
the
motionless
form
of
a
woman
standing
with
her
forehead
pressed
against
the
pane
of
glass
a
prey
to
the
indescribable
agony
which
seizes
a
man
when
he
feels
that
his
life
is
at
stake
that
his
future
is
about
to
be
irrevocably
decided
pascal
counted
the
seconds
as
they
passed
by
he
found
it
impossible
to
reflect
to
deliberate
to
decide
on
any
plan
of
action
he
forgot
the
tortures
he
had
endured
during
the
last
hours
coralth
valorsay
madame
d
argeles
the
baron
no
longer
existed
for
him
he
forgot
his
loss
of
honor
and
position
and
the
disgrace
attached
to
his
name
the
past
was
annihilated
as
it
were
and
he
could
think
of
no
future
beyond
the
next
few
moments
his
physical
condition
undoubtedly
contributed
to
his
mental
weakness
he
had
taken
no
food
that
day
and
he
was
faint
from
want
of
nourishment
he
had
come
without
an
overcoat
moreover
and
the
cold
night
air
chilled
him
to
the
bone
there
was
a
strange
ringing
in
his
ears
and
a
mist
swam
before
his
eyes
at
last
the
bell
at
the
beaujon
hospital
tolled
the
appointed
hour
and
roused
him
from
his
lethargy
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
crying
to
him
in
the
darkness
up
the
hour
has
come
trembling
and
with
tottering
limbs
he
dragged
himself
to
the
little
gate
opening
into
the
gardens
of
the
chalusse
mansion
soon
it
softly
opened
and
madame
leon
appeared
ah
it
was
not
she
that
pascal
had
hoped
to
see
unfortunate
man
he
had
been
listening
to
that
mysterious
echo
of
our
own
desires
which
we
so
often
mistake
for
a
presentiment
and
it
had
whispered
in
his
heart
marguerite
herself
will
come
with
the
candor
of
wretchedness
he
could
not
refrain
from
telling
madame
leon
the
hope
he
had
entertained
but
on
hearing
him
the
housekeeper
recoiled
with
a
gesture
of
outraged
propriety
and
reproachfully
exclaimed
what
are
you
thinking
of
monsieur
what
could
you
suppose
that
mademoiselle
marguerite
would
abandon
her
place
by
her
dead
father
s
bedside
to
come
to
a
rendezvous
ah
you
should
think
better
of
her
than
that
the
dear
child
he
sighed
deeply
and
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
he
asked
hasn
t
she
even
sent
me
a
reply
yes
monsieur
she
has
and
although
it
is
a
great
indiscretion
on
my
part
i
bring
you
the
letter
here
it
is
now
i
must
go
at
once
what
would
become
of
me
if
the
servants
discovered
my
absence
and
found
that
i
had
gone
out
alone
she
was
hurrying
away
but
pascal
detained
her
pray
wait
until
i
see
what
she
has
written
he
said
imploringly
i
shall
perhaps
be
obliged
to
send
her
some
message
in
madame
leon
obeyed
though
with
rather
bad
grace
and
not
without
several
times
repeating
make
haste
while
pascal
ran
to
a
street
lamp
near
by
it
was
not
a
letter
that
marguerite
had
sent
him
but
a
short
note
written
on
a
scrap
of
crumpled
paper
folded
and
not
sealed
it
was
written
in
pencil
and
the
handwriting
was
irregular
and
indistinct
still
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
gas
pascal
deciphered
the
word
it
made
him
shudder
monsieur
what
did
this
mean
in
writing
to
him
of
recent
times
marguerite
had
always
said
my
dear
pascal
or
my
nevertheless
he
continued
i
have
not
had
the
courage
to
resist
the
entreaties
made
to
me
by
the
count
de
chalusse
my
father
in
his
last
agony
i
have
solemnly
pledged
myself
to
become
the
wife
of
the
marquis
de
valorsay
one
can
not
break
a
promise
made
to
the
dying
i
shall
keep
mine
even
though
my
heart
break
i
shall
do
my
duty
god
will
give
me
strength
and
courage
forget
her
whom
you
loved
she
is
now
the
betrothed
of
another
and
honor
commands
her
to
forget
your
very
name
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
farewell
if
you
love
me
you
will
not
try
to
see
me
again
it
would
only
add
to
my
misery
think
as
though
she
were
dead
she
who
signs
herself
the
commonplace
wording
of
this
letter
and
the
mistakes
in
spelling
that
marred
it
entirely
escaped
pascal
s
notice
he
only
understood
one
thing
that
marguerite
was
lost
to
him
and
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
the
wife
of
the
vile
scoundrel
who
had
planned
the
snare
which
had
ruined
him
at
the
hotel
d
argeles
breathless
despairing
and
half
crazed
with
rage
he
sprang
toward
madame
leon
marguerite
where
is
she
he
demanded
in
a
hoarse
unnatural
voice
i
must
see
her
oh
monsieur
what
do
you
ask
is
it
possible
allow
me
to
explain
to
you
but
the
housekeeper
was
unable
to
finish
her
sentence
for
pascal
had
caught
her
by
the
hands
and
holding
them
in
a
vicelike
grip
he
repeated
i
must
see
marguerite
and
speak
to
her
i
must
tell
her
that
she
has
been
deceived
i
will
unmask
the
scoundrel
who
the
frightened
housekeeper
struggled
with
all
her
might
trying
her
best
to
reach
the
little
gate
which
was
standing
open
you
hurt
me
she
cried
are
you
mad
let
me
go
or
i
shall
call
for
help
and
twice
indeed
she
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
help
murder
but
her
cries
were
lost
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
if
any
one
heard
them
no
one
came
still
they
recalled
pascal
to
a
sense
of
the
situation
and
he
was
ashamed
of
his
violence
he
released
madame
leon
and
his
manner
suddenly
became
as
humble
as
it
had
been
threatening
excuse
me
he
said
entreatingly
i
am
suffering
so
much
that
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
doing
i
beseech
you
to
take
me
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
or
else
run
and
beg
her
to
come
here
i
ask
but
a
madame
leon
pretended
to
be
listening
attentively
but
in
reality
she
was
quietly
manoeuvring
to
gain
the
garden
gate
soon
she
succeeded
in
doing
so
whereupon
with
marvellous
strength
and
agility
she
pushed
pascal
away
and
sprang
inside
the
garden
closing
the
gate
after
her
and
saying
as
she
did
so
begone
you
scoundrel
this
was
the
final
blow
and
for
more
than
a
minute
pascal
stood
motionless
in
front
of
the
gate
stupefied
with
mingled
rage
and
sorrow
his
condition
was
not
unlike
that
of
a
man
who
after
falling
to
the
bottom
of
a
precipice
is
dragging
himself
up
all
mangled
and
bleeding
swearing
that
he
will
yet
save
himself
when
suddenly
a
heavy
stone
which
he
had
loosened
in
his
descent
falls
forward
and
crushes
him
all
that
he
had
so
far
endured
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
thought
that
valorsay
would
wed
marguerite
was
such
a
thing
possible
would
god
permit
such
a
monstrous
iniquity
no
that
shall
never
be
he
muttered
i
will
murder
the
scoundrel
rather
and
afterward
justice
may
do
whatever
it
likes
with
he
experienced
that
implacable
merciless
thirsting
for
vengeance
which
does
not
even
recoil
before
the
commission
of
a
crime
to
secure
satisfaction
and
this
longing
inflamed
him
with
such
energy
that
although
he
had
been
so
utterly
exhausted
a
few
moments
before
he
was
not
half
an
hour
in
making
his
way
back
to
his
new
home
his
mother
who
was
waiting
for
him
with
an
anxious
heart
was
surprised
by
the
flush
on
his
cheeks
and
the
light
glittering
in
his
eyes
ah
you
bring
good
news
she
exclaimed
his
only
answer
was
to
hand
her
the
letter
which
madame
leon
had
given
him
saying
as
he
did
so
madame
ferailleur
s
eyes
fell
upon
the
words
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
farewell
she
understood
everything
turned
very
pale
and
in
a
trembling
voice
exclaimed
don
t
grieve
my
son
the
girl
did
not
love
oh
mother
if
you
knew
but
she
checked
him
with
a
gesture
and
lifting
her
head
proudly
she
said
i
know
what
it
is
to
love
pascal
it
is
to
have
perfect
faith
if
the
whole
world
had
accused
your
father
of
a
crime
would
a
single
doubt
of
his
innocence
have
ever
entered
my
mind
this
girl
has
doubted
you
they
have
told
her
that
you
cheated
at
cards
and
she
has
believed
it
you
have
failed
to
see
that
this
oath
at
the
bedside
of
the
dying
count
is
only
an
it
was
true
the
thought
had
not
occurred
to
pascal
my
god
he
cried
in
agony
are
you
the
only
one
who
believes
in
my
innocence
without
proofs
yes
it
must
be
your
task
to
obtain
these
and
i
shall
obtain
them
he
rejoined
in
a
tone
of
determination
i
am
strong
now
that
i
have
marguerite
s
life
to
defend
for
they
have
deceived
her
mother
or
she
would
never
have
given
me
up
oh
don
t
shake
your
head
i
love
her
and
so
i
trust
xvii
isidore
fortunat
was
not
the
man
to
go
to
sleep
over
a
plan
when
it
was
once
formed
whenever
he
said
to
himself
i
ll
do
this
or
that
he
did
it
as
soon
as
possible
that
very
evening
rather
than
the
next
day
having
sworn
that
he
would
find
out
madame
d
argeles
s
son
the
heir
to
the
count
de
chalusse
s
millions
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
decide
which
of
his
agents
he
would
select
to
assist
him
in
this
difficult
task
thus
his
first
care
on
returning
home
was
to
ask
his
bookkeeper
for
victor
chupin
s
address
he
lives
in
the
faubourg
replied
the
bookkeeper
at
very
well
muttered
fortunat
i
ll
go
there
as
soon
as
i
have
eaten
my
and
indeed
as
soon
as
he
had
swallowed
his
coffee
he
requested
madame
dodelin
to
bring
him
his
overcoat
and
half
an
hour
later
he
reached
the
door
of
the
house
where
his
clerk
resided
the
house
was
one
of
those
huge
ungainly
structures
large
enough
to
shelter
the
population
of
a
small
village
with
three
or
four
courtyards
as
many
staircases
as
there
are
letters
in
the
alphabet
and
a
concierge
who
seldom
remembers
the
names
of
the
tenants
except
on
when
he
goes
to
collect
the
rent
and
at
new
year
when
he
expects
a
gratuity
but
by
one
of
those
lucky
chances
made
expressly
for
fortunat
the
porter
did
recollect
chupin
knew
him
and
was
kindly
disposed
toward
him
and
so
he
told
the
visitor
exactly
how
and
where
to
find
him
it
was
very
simple
he
had
only
to
cross
the
first
courtyard
take
staircase
d
on
the
side
ascend
to
the
sixth
floor
go
straight
ahead
etc
thanks
to
this
unusual
civility
fortunat
did
not
lose
his
way
more
than
five
times
before
reaching
the
door
upon
which
was
fastened
a
bit
of
pasteboard
bearing
victor
chupin
s
name
noticing
that
a
hung
beside
the
door
fortunat
pulled
it
whereupon
there
was
a
tinkling
and
a
voice
called
out
come
in
he
complied
and
found
himself
in
a
small
and
cheaply
furnished
room
which
was
however
radiant
with
the
cleanliness
which
is
in
itself
a
luxury
the
waxed
floor
shone
like
a
mirror
the
furniture
was
brilliantly
polished
and
the
counterpane
and
curtains
of
the
bed
were
as
white
as
snow
what
first
attracted
the
agent
s
attention
was
the
number
of
superfluous
articles
scattered
about
the
apartment
some
plaster
statuettes
on
either
side
of
a
gilt
clock
an
etagere
crowded
with
knickknacks
and
five
or
six
passable
engravings
when
he
entered
victor
chupin
was
sitting
in
his
at
a
little
table
where
by
the
light
of
a
small
lamp
and
with
a
zeal
that
brought
a
flush
to
his
cheeks
he
was
copying
in
a
very
fair
hand
a
page
from
a
french
dictionary
near
the
bed
in
the
shade
sat
a
poorly
but
neatly
clad
woman
about
forty
years
of
age
who
was
knitting
industriously
with
some
long
wooden
needles
m
victor
chupin
inquired
fortunat
the
sound
of
his
voice
made
the
young
man
spring
to
his
feet
he
quickly
lifted
the
shade
from
his
lamp
and
without
attempting
to
conceal
his
astonishment
exclaimed
m
sieur
fortunat
at
this
hour
where
s
the
fire
then
in
a
grave
manner
that
contrasted
strangely
with
his
accustomed
levity
mother
said
he
this
is
one
of
my
patrons
m
sieur
fortunat
you
know
the
gentleman
whom
i
collect
the
knitter
rose
bowed
respectfully
and
said
i
hope
sir
that
you
are
pleased
with
my
son
and
that
he
s
certainly
madame
replied
the
agent
certainly
victor
is
one
of
my
best
and
most
reliable
then
i
m
content
said
the
woman
reseating
herself
chupin
also
seemed
delighted
this
is
my
good
mother
sir
said
he
she
s
almost
blind
now
but
in
less
than
six
months
she
will
be
able
to
stand
at
her
window
and
see
a
pin
in
the
middle
of
the
street
so
the
physician
who
is
treating
her
eyes
promised
me
then
we
shall
be
all
right
again
but
take
a
seat
sir
may
we
venture
to
offer
you
anything
although
his
clerk
had
more
than
once
alluded
to
his
responsibilities
fortunat
was
amazed
he
marvelled
at
the
perfume
of
honesty
which
exhaled
from
these
poor
people
at
the
dignity
of
this
humble
woman
and
at
the
protecting
and
respectful
affection
evinced
by
her
son
a
young
man
whose
usual
tone
of
voice
and
general
behavior
had
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
decidedly
a
scapegrace
thanks
victor
he
replied
i
won
t
take
any
refreshment
i
ve
just
left
the
i
ve
come
to
give
you
my
instructions
respecting
a
very
important
and
very
urgent
chupin
at
once
understood
that
his
employer
wished
for
a
private
interview
accordingly
he
took
up
the
lamp
opened
a
door
and
in
the
pompous
tone
of
a
rich
banker
who
is
inviting
some
important
personage
to
enter
his
private
room
he
said
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
step
into
my
chamber
m
sieur
the
room
which
chupin
so
emphatically
denominated
his
chamber
was
a
tiny
nook
extraordinarily
clean
it
is
true
but
scantily
furnished
with
a
small
iron
bedstead
a
trunk
and
a
chair
he
offered
the
chair
to
his
visitor
placed
the
lamp
on
the
trunk
and
seated
himself
on
the
bed
saying
as
he
did
so
this
is
scarcely
on
so
grand
a
scale
as
your
establishment
m
sieur
but
i
am
going
to
ask
the
landlord
to
gild
the
window
of
my
fortunat
was
positively
touched
he
held
out
his
hand
to
his
clerk
and
exclaimed
you
re
a
worthy
fellow
nonsense
m
sieur
one
does
what
one
can
but
zounds
how
hard
it
is
to
make
money
honestly
if
my
good
mother
could
only
see
she
would
help
me
famously
for
there
is
no
one
like
her
for
work
but
you
see
one
can
t
become
a
millionaire
by
knitting
doesn
t
your
father
live
with
you
chupin
s
eyes
gleamed
angrily
ah
don
t
speak
of
that
man
to
me
m
sieur
he
exclaimed
or
i
shall
hurt
and
then
as
if
he
felt
it
necessary
to
explain
and
excuse
his
vindictive
exclamation
he
added
my
father
polyte
chupin
is
a
scamp
and
yet
he
s
had
his
opportunities
first
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
wife
like
my
mother
who
is
honesty
itself
so
much
so
that
she
was
called
toinon
the
virtuous
when
she
was
young
she
idolized
him
and
nearly
killed
herself
by
working
to
earn
money
for
him
and
yet
he
abused
her
so
much
and
made
her
weep
so
much
that
she
has
become
blind
but
that
s
not
all
one
morning
there
came
to
him
i
don
t
know
whence
or
how
enough
money
for
him
to
have
lived
like
a
gentleman
i
believe
it
was
a
munificent
reward
for
some
service
he
had
rendered
a
great
nobleman
at
the
time
when
my
grandmother
who
is
now
dead
kept
a
dramshop
called
the
poivriere
any
other
man
would
have
treasured
that
money
but
not
he
what
he
did
was
to
carouse
day
and
night
and
all
the
while
my
poor
mother
was
working
her
fingers
to
the
bone
to
earn
food
for
me
she
never
saw
a
penny
of
all
his
money
and
indeed
once
when
she
asked
him
to
pay
the
rent
he
beat
her
so
cruelly
that
she
was
laid
up
in
bed
for
a
week
however
monsieur
you
can
very
readily
understand
that
when
a
man
leads
that
kind
of
life
he
speedily
comes
to
the
end
of
his
banking
account
so
my
father
was
soon
without
a
penny
in
his
purse
and
then
he
was
obliged
to
work
in
order
to
get
something
to
eat
and
this
didn
t
suit
him
at
all
but
when
he
didn
t
know
where
to
find
a
crust
he
remembered
us
he
sought
us
out
and
found
us
once
i
lent
him
a
hundred
sous
the
next
day
he
came
for
forty
more
and
the
next
for
three
francs
then
for
five
francs
again
and
so
it
was
every
day
give
me
this
or
give
me
that
at
last
i
said
enough
of
this
the
bank
s
closed
then
what
do
you
think
he
did
he
watched
the
house
until
he
saw
me
go
out
then
he
came
in
with
a
and
tried
to
sell
everything
pretending
that
he
was
the
master
and
my
poor
dear
mother
would
have
allowed
him
to
do
it
fortunately
i
happened
to
come
in
again
let
him
sell
my
furniture
not
i
would
sooner
have
been
chopped
in
pieces
i
went
and
complained
to
the
commissary
of
police
who
made
my
father
leave
the
house
and
since
then
we
ve
lived
in
certainly
this
was
more
than
sufficient
to
explain
and
excuse
victor
chupin
s
indignation
and
yet
he
had
prudently
withheld
the
most
serious
and
important
cause
of
his
dislike
what
he
refrained
from
telling
was
that
years
before
when
he
was
still
a
mere
child
without
will
or
discernment
his
father
had
taken
him
from
his
mother
and
had
started
him
down
that
terrible
descent
which
inevitably
leads
one
to
prison
or
the
gallows
unless
there
be
an
almost
miraculous
interposition
on
one
s
behalf
this
miracle
had
occurred
in
chupin
s
case
but
he
did
not
boast
of
it
come
come
said
fortunat
don
t
worry
too
much
about
it
a
father
s
a
father
after
all
and
yours
will
undoubtedly
reform
by
and
he
said
this
as
he
would
have
said
anything
else
out
of
politeness
and
for
the
sake
of
testifying
a
friendly
interest
but
he
really
cared
no
more
for
this
information
concerning
the
chupin
family
than
the
grand
turk
his
first
emotion
had
quickly
vanished
and
he
was
beginning
to
find
these
confidential
disclosures
rather
wearisome
let
us
get
back
to
business
he
remarked
that
is
to
say
to
casimir
what
did
you
do
with
the
fool
after
my
departure
first
monsieur
i
sobered
him
which
was
no
easy
task
the
greedy
idiot
had
converted
himself
into
a
at
last
however
when
he
could
talk
as
well
as
you
and
i
and
walk
straight
i
took
him
back
to
the
hotel
de
that
was
right
but
didn
t
you
have
some
business
to
transact
with
him
that
s
been
arranged
monsieur
the
agreement
has
been
signed
the
count
will
have
the
best
of
funerals
the
finest
hearse
out
with
six
horses
mourning
coaches
a
grand
display
in
fact
it
will
be
worth
fortunat
smiled
graciously
that
ought
to
bring
you
a
handsome
commission
he
said
benignly
employed
by
the
job
chupin
was
the
master
of
his
own
time
free
to
utilize
his
intelligence
and
industry
as
he
chose
but
fortunat
did
not
like
his
subordinates
to
make
any
money
except
through
him
hence
his
approval
in
the
present
instance
was
so
remarkable
that
it
awakened
chupin
s
suspicions
i
shall
make
a
few
sous
probably
he
modestly
replied
a
trifle
to
aid
my
good
mother
in
keeping
the
pot
so
much
the
better
my
boy
said
fortunat
i
like
to
see
money
gained
by
those
who
make
a
good
use
of
it
and
to
prove
this
i
m
about
to
employ
you
in
an
affair
which
will
pay
you
handsomely
if
you
prosecute
it
chupin
s
eyes
brightened
at
first
but
grew
dark
a
moment
afterward
for
delight
had
been
quickly
followed
by
a
feeling
of
distrust
he
thought
it
exceedingly
strange
that
an
employer
should
take
the
trouble
to
climb
to
a
sixth
floor
merely
for
the
purpose
of
conferring
a
favor
on
his
clerk
there
must
be
something
behind
all
this
and
so
it
behove
him
to
keep
his
eyes
open
however
he
knew
how
to
conceal
his
real
feelings
and
it
was
with
a
joyous
air
that
he
exclaimed
eh
what
money
now
what
must
i
do
to
earn
it
oh
a
mere
trifle
replied
the
agent
almost
nothing
and
drawing
his
chair
nearer
to
the
bed
on
which
his
employee
was
seated
he
added
but
first
one
question
victor
by
the
way
in
which
a
woman
looks
at
a
young
man
in
the
street
at
the
theatre
or
anywhere
would
you
know
if
she
were
watching
her
son
chupin
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
a
question
he
retorted
nonsense
monsieur
it
would
be
impossible
to
deceive
me
i
should
only
have
to
remember
my
mother
s
eyes
when
i
return
home
in
the
evening
poor
woman
although
she
s
half
blind
she
sees
me
and
if
you
wish
to
make
her
happy
you
ve
only
to
tell
her
i
m
the
handsomest
and
most
amiable
youth
in
fortunat
could
not
refrain
from
rubbing
his
hands
so
delighted
was
he
to
see
his
idea
so
perfectly
understood
and
so
admirably
expressed
good
he
declared
very
good
that
s
intelligence
if
i
am
any
judge
i
have
not
been
deceived
in
you
victor
was
on
fire
with
curiosity
what
am
i
to
do
monsieur
he
asked
eagerly
this
you
must
follow
a
woman
whom
i
shall
point
out
to
you
follow
her
everywhere
without
once
losing
sight
of
her
and
so
skilfully
as
not
to
let
her
suspect
it
you
must
watch
her
every
glance
and
when
her
eyes
tell
you
that
she
is
looking
at
her
son
your
task
will
be
nearly
over
you
will
then
only
have
to
follow
this
son
and
find
out
his
name
and
address
what
he
does
and
how
he
lives
i
don
t
know
if
i
explain
what
i
mean
very
this
doubt
was
awakened
in
fortunat
s
mind
by
chupin
s
features
which
were
expressive
of
lively
astonishment
and
discontent
excuse
me
monsieur
he
said
at
last
i
do
not
understand
at
it
s
very
simple
however
the
lady
in
question
has
a
son
about
twenty
i
know
it
i
m
sure
of
it
but
she
denies
it
she
conceals
the
fact
and
he
doesn
t
even
know
her
she
secretly
watches
over
him
however
she
provides
him
with
money
and
every
day
she
finds
some
way
of
seeing
him
now
it
is
to
my
interest
to
find
this
chupin
s
mobile
face
became
actually
threatening
in
its
expression
he
frowned
darkly
and
his
lips
quivered
still
this
did
not
prevent
fortunat
from
adding
with
the
assurance
of
a
man
who
does
not
even
suspect
the
possibility
of
a
refusal
now
when
shall
we
set
about
our
task
never
cried
chupin
violently
and
rising
he
continued
no
i
wouldn
t
let
my
good
mother
eat
bread
earned
in
that
way
it
would
strangle
her
turn
spy
i
thanks
some
one
else
may
have
the
job
he
had
become
as
red
as
a
and
such
was
his
indignation
that
he
forgot
his
accustomed
reserve
and
the
caution
with
which
he
had
so
far
concealed
his
antecedents
i
know
this
game
i
ve
tried
it
he
went
on
vehemently
one
might
as
well
take
one
s
ticket
to
prison
by
a
direct
road
i
should
be
there
now
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
monsieur
andre
i
was
thirsting
for
gold
and
like
the
brigand
that
i
was
i
should
have
killed
the
man
but
in
revenge
he
drew
me
from
the
mire
and
placed
my
feet
on
solid
ground
once
more
and
now
shall
i
go
back
to
my
vile
tricks
again
why
i
d
rather
cut
my
leg
off
i
m
to
hunt
down
this
poor
woman
i
m
to
discover
her
secret
so
that
you
may
extort
money
from
her
am
i
no
not
i
i
should
like
to
be
rich
and
i
shall
be
rich
but
i
ll
make
my
money
honestly
i
hope
to
touch
my
pieces
without
being
obliged
to
wash
my
hands
afterward
so
a
very
good
evening
to
your
fortunat
was
amazed
and
at
the
same
time
much
annoyed
to
find
himself
forsaken
on
account
of
such
a
trifle
he
feared
too
that
chupin
might
let
his
tongue
wag
if
he
left
his
employment
so
since
he
had
confided
this
project
to
chupin
he
was
determined
that
chupin
alone
should
carry
it
into
execution
assuming
his
most
severe
and
injured
manner
he
sternly
exclaimed
i
think
you
have
lost
your
his
demeanor
and
intonation
were
so
perfectly
cool
that
chupin
seemed
slightly
abashed
it
seems
that
you
think
me
capable
of
urging
you
to
commit
some
dangerous
and
dishonorable
act
continued
fortunat
why
no
m
sieur
i
assure
there
was
such
evident
hesitation
in
the
utterance
of
this
no
that
the
agent
at
once
resumed
come
you
are
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
my
business
as
a
collector
i
give
my
attention
to
the
discovery
of
the
heirs
of
unclaimed
estates
you
are
aware
of
this
very
well
then
pray
tell
me
how
i
am
to
find
them
without
searching
for
them
if
i
wish
this
lady
to
be
watched
it
is
only
in
view
of
reaching
a
poor
lad
who
is
likely
to
be
defrauded
of
the
wealth
that
rightfully
belongs
to
him
and
when
i
give
you
a
chance
to
make
forty
or
fifty
francs
in
a
couple
of
days
you
receive
my
proposition
in
this
style
you
are
an
ingrate
and
a
fool
victor
chupin
s
nature
combined
in
a
remarkable
degree
the
vices
and
peculiarities
of
the
dweller
in
the
paris
faubourgs
who
is
born
old
but
who
when
aged
in
years
still
remains
a
gamin
in
his
youth
he
had
seen
many
strange
things
and
acquired
a
knowledge
of
life
that
would
have
put
the
experience
of
a
philosopher
to
shame
but
he
was
not
fit
to
cope
with
fortunat
who
had
an
immense
advantage
over
him
by
reason
of
his
position
of
employer
as
well
as
by
his
fortune
and
education
so
chupin
was
both
bewildered
and
disconcerted
by
the
cool
arguments
his
patron
brought
forward
and
what
most
effectually
allayed
his
suspicions
was
the
small
compensation
offered
for
the
work
merely
forty
or
fifty
francs
small
potatoes
upon
my
word
he
thought
just
the
price
of
an
honest
service
he
would
have
offered
more
for
a
piece
of
so
after
considering
a
moment
he
said
aloud
very
well
i
m
your
man
m
fortunat
was
secretly
laughing
at
the
success
of
his
ruse
having
come
with
the
intention
of
offering
his
agent
a
handsome
sum
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
chupin
s
scruples
would
enable
him
to
save
his
money
if
i
hadn
t
found
you
engaged
in
study
victor
he
said
i
should
have
thought
you
had
been
drinking
what
venomous
insect
stung
you
so
suddenly
haven
t
i
confided
similar
undertakings
to
you
twenty
times
since
you
have
been
in
my
employment
who
ransacked
paris
to
find
certain
debtors
who
were
concealing
themselves
who
discovered
the
vantrassons
for
me
victor
chupin
very
well
then
allow
me
to
say
that
i
see
nothing
in
this
case
in
any
way
differing
from
the
others
nor
can
i
understand
why
this
should
be
wrong
if
the
others
were
chupin
could
only
have
answered
this
remark
by
saying
that
there
had
been
no
mystery
about
the
previous
affairs
that
they
had
not
been
proposed
to
him
late
at
night
at
his
own
home
and
that
he
had
acted
openly
as
a
person
who
represents
a
creditor
has
a
recognized
right
to
act
but
though
he
felt
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
present
case
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
him
to
explain
in
what
this
difference
consisted
hence
in
his
most
resolute
tone
i
m
only
a
fool
m
sieur
he
declared
but
i
shall
know
how
to
make
amends
for
my
that
means
you
have
recovered
your
senses
said
fortunat
ironically
really
that
s
fortunate
but
let
me
give
you
one
bit
of
advice
watch
yourself
and
learn
to
bridle
your
tongue
you
won
t
always
find
me
in
such
a
good
humor
as
i
am
this
so
saying
he
rose
passed
out
into
the
adjoining
room
bowed
civilly
to
his
clerk
s
mother
and
went
off
his
last
words
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
were
so
i
shall
rely
upon
you
be
at
the
office
a
little
before
it
s
agreed
m
the
blind
woman
had
risen
and
had
bowed
respectfully
but
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
with
her
son
she
asked
what
is
this
business
he
bids
you
undertake
in
such
a
high
and
mighty
tone
oh
an
matter
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
why
were
you
talking
so
loud
then
she
inquired
weren
t
you
quarrelling
it
must
be
something
very
grave
when
it
s
necessary
to
conceal
it
from
me
i
couldn
t
see
your
employer
s
face
my
son
but
i
heard
his
voice
and
it
didn
t
please
me
it
isn
t
the
voice
of
an
honest
straightforward
man
take
care
toto
and
don
t
allow
yourself
to
be
cajoled
be
however
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
recommend
prudence
to
victor
chupin
he
had
promised
his
assistance
but
not
without
a
mental
reservation
no
need
to
see
danger
till
it
comes
he
had
said
to
himself
if
the
thing
proves
to
be
of
questionable
propriety
after
all
then
i
it
remains
to
know
what
he
meant
by
questionable
propriety
the
meaning
of
the
expression
is
rather
vague
he
had
returned
in
all
honesty
and
sincerity
of
purpose
to
an
honest
life
and
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
induced
him
avaricious
though
he
was
to
commit
an
act
that
was
positively
wrong
only
the
line
that
separates
good
from
evil
was
not
very
clearly
defined
in
his
mind
this
was
due
in
a
great
measure
to
his
education
and
to
the
fact
that
it
had
been
long
before
he
realized
that
police
regulations
do
not
constitute
the
highest
moral
law
it
was
due
also
to
chance
and
since
he
had
no
decided
calling
to
the
necessity
of
depending
for
a
livelihood
upon
the
many
strange
professions
which
impecunious
and
untrained
individuals
both
of
the
higher
and
lower
classes
adopt
in
paris
however
on
the
following
morning
he
arrayed
himself
in
his
best
apparel
and
at
exactly
eleven
o
clock
he
rang
at
his
employer
s
door
fortunat
had
made
quick
work
with
his
clients
that
morning
and
was
ready
dressed
to
go
out
he
took
up
his
hat
and
said
only
the
one
word
the
place
where
the
agent
conducted
his
clerk
was
the
in
the
rue
de
berry
where
he
had
made
inquiries
respecting
madame
d
argeles
the
evening
before
and
on
arriving
there
he
generously
offered
him
a
breakfast
before
entering
however
he
pointed
out
madame
d
argeles
s
pretty
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
said
to
him
the
woman
whom
you
are
to
follow
and
whose
son
you
are
to
discover
will
emerge
from
that
at
that
moment
after
a
night
passed
in
meditating
upon
his
mother
s
prophetic
warnings
chupin
was
again
beset
by
the
same
scruples
which
had
so
greatly
disturbed
him
on
the
previous
evening
however
they
soon
vanished
when
he
heard
the
in
reply
to
fortunat
s
skilful
questions
begin
to
relate
all
he
knew
concerning
madame
lia
d
argeles
and
the
scandalous
doings
at
her
house
the
seeker
after
lost
heirs
and
his
clerk
were
served
at
a
little
table
near
the
door
and
while
they
partook
of
the
classical
and
potatoes
fortunat
eating
daintily
and
chupin
bolting
his
food
with
the
appetite
of
a
mariner
they
watched
the
house
opposite
madame
d
argeles
received
on
saturdays
and
as
chupin
remarked
there
was
a
regular
procession
of
standing
beside
fortunat
and
flattered
by
the
attention
which
such
a
gentleman
paid
to
his
chatter
the
landlord
of
the
house
mentioned
the
names
of
all
the
visitors
he
knew
and
he
knew
a
good
number
of
them
for
the
coachmen
came
to
his
shop
for
refreshments
when
their
masters
were
spending
the
night
in
play
at
madame
d
argeles
s
house
so
he
was
able
to
name
the
viscount
de
coralth
who
dashed
up
to
the
door
in
a
phaeton
as
well
as
baron
trigault
who
came
on
foot
for
exercise
puffing
and
blowing
like
a
seal
the
moreover
told
his
customers
that
madame
d
argeles
never
went
out
before
two
or
three
o
clock
and
then
always
in
a
carriage
a
piece
of
information
which
must
have
troubled
chupin
for
as
soon
as
the
landlord
had
left
them
to
serve
some
other
customers
he
leant
forward
and
said
to
fortunat
did
you
hear
that
how
is
it
possible
to
track
a
person
who
s
in
a
carriage
by
following
in
another
vehicle
of
certainly
m
sieur
that
s
as
clear
as
daylight
but
that
isn
t
the
question
the
point
is
this
how
can
one
watch
the
face
of
a
person
who
turns
her
back
to
you
i
must
see
this
woman
s
face
to
know
whom
she
looks
at
and
this
objection
grave
as
it
appeared
did
not
seem
to
disturb
fortunat
don
t
worry
about
that
victor
he
replied
under
such
circumstances
a
mother
wouldn
t
try
to
see
her
son
from
a
rapidly
moving
carriage
she
will
undoubtedly
alight
and
contrive
some
means
of
passing
and
repassing
him
of
touching
him
if
possible
your
task
will
only
consist
in
following
her
closely
enough
to
be
on
the
ground
as
soon
as
she
is
confine
your
efforts
to
that
and
if
you
fail
you
ll
succeed
or
the
day
after
the
essential
thing
is
to
be
he
did
better
than
to
preach
patience
he
practised
it
the
hours
wore
away
and
yet
he
did
not
stir
from
his
post
though
nothing
could
have
been
more
disagreeable
to
him
than
to
remain
on
exhibition
as
it
were
at
the
door
of
a
at
last
at
a
little
before
three
o
clock
the
gates
over
the
way
turned
upon
their
hinges
and
a
victoria
in
which
a
woman
was
seated
rolled
forth
into
the
street
look
said
fortunat
eagerly
there
she
is
xviii
the
woman
in
the
carriage
was
none
other
than
madame
lia
d
argeles
she
was
attired
in
one
of
those
startling
costumes
which
are
the
rage
nowadays
and
which
impart
the
same
bold
and
brazen
appearance
to
all
who
wear
them
so
much
so
that
the
most
experienced
observers
are
no
longer
able
to
distinguish
the
honest
mother
of
a
family
from
a
notorious
character
a
dutchman
named
van
klopen
who
was
originally
a
tailor
at
rotterdam
rightfully
ascribes
the
honor
of
this
progress
to
himself
one
can
scarcely
explain
how
it
happens
that
this
individual
who
calls
himself
the
dressmaker
of
the
queens
of
europe
has
become
the
arbiter
of
parisian
elegance
but
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that
he
does
reign
over
fashion
he
decrees
the
colors
that
shall
be
worn
decides
whether
dresses
shall
be
short
or
long
whether
paniers
shall
be
adopted
or
discarded
whether
ruches
and
puffs
and
flowers
shall
be
allowed
and
in
what
form
and
his
subjects
the
elegant
women
of
paris
obey
him
implicitly
madame
d
argeles
would
personally
have
preferred
less
finery
perhaps
but
it
would
not
have
done
for
her
to
be
out
of
the
fashion
she
wore
an
imperceptible
hat
balanced
on
an
immense
pyramidal
chignon
from
which
escaped
a
torrent
of
wavy
hair
what
a
beautiful
woman
exclaimed
the
dazzled
chupin
and
indeed
seen
from
this
distance
she
did
not
look
a
day
more
than
an
age
when
beauty
possesses
all
the
alluring
charm
of
the
luscious
fruit
of
autumn
she
was
giving
orders
for
the
drive
and
her
coachman
with
a
rose
in
his
buttonhole
listened
while
he
reined
in
the
spirited
horse
the
weather
s
superb
added
chupin
she
ll
no
doubt
drive
round
the
lakes
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
ah
she
s
off
interrupted
fortunat
run
victor
run
and
don
t
be
miserly
as
regards
carriage
hire
all
your
expenses
shall
be
liberally
refunded
chupin
was
already
far
away
madame
d
argeles
s
horse
went
swiftly
enough
but
the
agent
s
emissary
had
the
limbs
and
the
endurance
of
a
stag
and
he
kept
pace
with
the
victoria
without
much
difficulty
and
as
he
ran
along
his
brain
was
busy
if
i
don
t
take
a
cab
he
said
to
himself
if
i
follow
the
woman
on
foot
i
shall
have
a
perfect
right
to
pocket
the
sous
an
hour
fifty
counting
the
gratuity
that
a
cab
would
but
on
reaching
the
champ
elysees
he
discovered
to
his
regret
that
this
plan
was
impracticable
for
on
running
down
the
avenue
de
l
imperatrice
after
the
rapidly
driven
carriage
he
could
not
fail
to
attract
attention
stifling
a
sigh
of
regret
and
seeing
a
cab
at
a
stand
near
by
he
hastily
hailed
it
where
do
you
want
to
go
sir
inquired
the
driver
just
follow
that
blue
victoria
in
which
a
handsome
lady
is
seated
my
good
the
order
did
not
surprise
the
cabman
but
rather
the
person
who
gave
it
for
in
spite
of
his
fine
apparel
chupin
did
not
seem
quite
the
man
for
such
an
adventure
excuse
me
said
the
jehu
in
a
slightly
ironical
tone
i
i
said
exactly
what
i
mean
retorted
chupin
whose
pride
was
severely
wounded
and
no
more
talk
hurry
on
or
we
shall
miss
the
this
last
remark
was
correct
for
if
madame
d
argeles
s
coachman
had
not
slackened
his
horse
s
speed
on
passing
round
the
arc
de
triomphe
the
woman
would
have
escaped
chupin
for
that
day
at
least
however
this
circumstance
gave
the
cabman
an
opportunity
to
overtake
the
victoria
and
after
that
the
two
vehicles
kept
close
together
as
they
proceeded
down
the
avenue
de
l
imperatrice
but
at
the
entrance
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
chupin
ordered
his
driver
to
stop
halt
he
exclaimed
i
shall
get
out
pay
the
extra
cab
charges
for
passing
beyond
the
limits
of
paris
never
i
ll
crawl
on
my
hands
and
knees
first
here
are
forty
sous
for
your
fare
and
to
and
as
the
blue
victoria
was
already
some
distance
in
advance
he
started
off
at
the
top
of
his
speed
to
overtake
it
this
manoeuvre
was
the
result
of
his
meditations
while
riding
along
what
will
this
fine
lady
do
when
she
gets
to
the
bois
he
asked
himself
why
her
coachman
will
take
his
place
in
the
procession
and
drive
her
slowly
round
and
round
the
lakes
meantime
i
can
trot
along
beside
her
without
attracting
attention
and
it
will
be
good
for
my
his
expectations
were
realized
in
every
respect
the
victoria
soon
turned
to
the
left
and
took
its
place
in
the
long
line
of
equipages
which
were
slowly
winding
round
the
lake
having
gained
the
which
borders
the
sheet
of
water
chupin
followed
the
carriage
easily
enough
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
heart
jubilant
at
the
thought
that
he
would
gain
the
sum
supposed
to
have
been
spent
in
cab
hire
in
addition
to
the
compensation
which
had
been
promised
him
this
is
a
strange
way
of
enjoying
one
s
self
he
muttered
as
he
trotted
along
there
can
t
be
much
pleasure
in
going
round
and
round
this
lake
if
ever
i
m
rich
i
ll
find
some
other
way
of
amusing
poor
chupin
did
not
know
that
people
do
not
go
to
the
bois
to
enjoy
themselves
but
rather
to
torment
others
this
broad
drive
is
in
reality
only
a
field
for
the
airing
of
vanity
a
sort
of
bazaar
for
the
display
of
dresses
and
equipages
people
come
here
to
see
and
to
be
seen
and
moreover
this
is
neutral
ground
where
honest
women
can
meet
those
notorious
characters
from
whom
they
are
elsewhere
separated
by
an
impassable
abyss
what
exquisite
pleasure
it
must
be
to
the
dames
of
society
to
find
themselves
beside
jenny
fancy
or
ninette
simplon
or
any
other
of
those
young
ladies
whom
they
habitually
call
creatures
but
whom
they
are
continually
talking
of
and
whose
toilettes
and
jargon
they
assiduously
copy
however
chupin
indulged
in
none
of
these
reflections
he
was
engaged
in
noting
madame
d
argeles
s
evident
anxiety
and
restlessness
she
looked
eagerly
on
all
sides
sometimes
half
leaning
out
of
her
carriage
and
immediately
turning
her
head
whenever
she
heard
the
gallop
of
a
horseman
behind
her
she
was
evidently
looking
or
waiting
for
some
one
but
the
person
did
not
make
his
appearance
and
so
growing
weary
of
waiting
after
driving
three
times
round
the
lake
she
made
a
sign
to
her
coachman
who
at
once
drew
out
of
line
and
turned
his
horse
into
a
chupin
hastened
after
the
victoria
keeping
it
in
sight
until
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
an
empty
cab
which
he
at
once
hired
madame
d
argeles
s
coachman
who
had
received
his
orders
now
drove
down
the
champs
elysees
again
crossed
the
place
de
la
concorde
turned
into
the
boulevards
and
stopped
short
at
the
corner
of
the
chaussee
d
antin
where
having
tied
a
thick
veil
over
her
face
madame
lia
abruptly
alighted
and
walked
away
this
was
done
so
quickly
that
chupin
barely
had
time
to
fling
two
francs
to
his
driver
and
rush
after
her
she
had
already
turned
round
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
helder
and
was
walking
rapidly
up
the
street
it
was
a
little
after
five
o
clock
and
dusk
was
setting
in
madame
d
argeles
had
taken
the
side
of
the
street
allotted
to
the
uneven
numbers
after
she
had
passed
the
hotel
de
homburg
she
slackened
her
pace
and
eagerly
scrutinized
one
of
the
houses
opposite
no
her
examination
lasted
but
a
moment
and
seemed
to
be
satisfactory
she
then
turned
and
rapidly
retraced
her
steps
as
far
as
the
boulevard
when
crossing
the
street
to
the
side
of
the
even
numbers
she
walked
up
it
again
very
slowly
stopping
before
every
convinced
that
he
had
almost
reached
the
goal
chupin
also
crossed
and
followed
closely
at
her
heels
he
soon
saw
her
start
and
resume
her
rapid
gait
a
young
man
was
coming
toward
her
so
quickly
indeed
that
she
had
not
time
to
avoid
him
and
a
collision
ensued
whereupon
the
young
man
gave
vent
to
an
oath
and
hurling
an
opprobrious
epithet
in
her
face
passed
on
chupin
shuddered
what
if
that
should
be
her
son
he
thought
and
while
he
pretended
to
be
gazing
into
a
shop
window
he
stealthily
watched
the
poor
woman
she
had
paused
and
he
was
so
near
that
he
could
almost
have
touched
her
he
saw
her
raise
her
veil
and
follow
her
insulter
with
a
look
which
it
was
impossible
to
misunderstand
oh
oh
it
was
her
son
that
called
her
that
said
chupin
to
himself
quite
horrified
and
without
more
ado
he
hastened
after
the
young
man
he
was
between
two
and
years
of
age
rather
above
the
medium
height
with
very
light
hair
and
an
extremely
pale
complexion
his
slight
mustache
would
have
been
almost
imperceptible
if
it
had
not
been
dyed
several
shades
darker
than
his
hair
he
was
attired
with
that
studied
carelessness
which
many
consider
to
be
the
height
of
elegance
but
which
is
just
the
reverse
and
his
bearing
his
mustache
and
his
low
hat
tipped
rakishly
over
one
ear
gave
him
an
arrogant
pretentious
rowdyish
appearance
zounds
that
fellow
doesn
t
suit
my
fancy
growled
chupin
as
he
trotted
along
for
he
was
almost
running
in
his
efforts
to
keep
pace
with
madame
d
argeles
s
insulter
the
latter
s
haste
was
soon
explained
he
was
carrying
a
letter
which
he
wished
to
have
delivered
and
no
doubt
he
feared
he
would
not
be
able
to
find
a
commissionaire
having
discovered
one
at
last
he
called
him
gave
him
the
missive
and
then
pursued
his
way
more
leisurely
he
had
reached
the
boulevard
when
a
youth
remarkably
short
and
stout
rushed
toward
him
with
both
hands
amicably
extended
at
the
same
time
crying
loud
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
is
it
possible
that
this
is
my
dear
wilkie
yes
alive
and
in
the
flesh
replied
the
young
man
well
and
what
the
devil
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
last
sunday
at
the
races
i
looked
for
you
everywhere
and
not
a
vestige
of
wilkie
was
to
be
found
however
you
were
wise
not
to
go
i
am
three
hundred
louis
out
of
pocket
i
staked
everything
on
domingo
the
marquis
de
valorsay
s
horse
i
thought
i
was
sure
to
win
yes
sure
well
domingo
came
in
third
can
you
understand
that
if
every
one
didn
t
know
that
valorsay
was
a
millionaire
it
might
be
supposed
there
had
been
some
foul
play
yes
upon
my
word
that
he
had
bet
against
his
own
horse
and
forbidden
his
jockey
to
win
the
but
the
speaker
did
not
really
believe
this
so
he
continued
more
gayly
fortunately
i
shall
retrieve
my
losses
at
vincennes
shall
we
see
you
there
then
until
until
thereupon
they
shook
hands
and
each
departed
on
his
way
chupin
had
not
lost
a
word
of
this
conversation
valorsay
a
millionaire
he
said
to
himself
that
s
good
ah
well
now
i
know
my
little
gamecock
s
name
and
i
also
know
that
he
goes
to
the
races
wilkie
that
must
be
an
english
name
i
like
the
name
of
d
argeles
better
but
where
the
devil
is
he
going
now
wilkie
had
simply
paused
to
replenish
his
at
the
tobacco
office
of
the
grand
hotel
and
after
lighting
a
cigar
he
came
out
again
and
walked
up
the
boulevard
in
the
direction
of
the
faubourg
montmartre
he
was
no
longer
in
a
hurry
now
he
strolled
along
in
view
of
killing
time
displaying
his
charms
and
staring
impudently
at
every
woman
who
passed
with
his
shoulders
drawn
up
on
a
level
with
his
ears
and
his
chest
thrown
back
he
dragged
his
feet
after
him
as
if
his
limbs
were
half
paralyzed
he
was
indeed
doing
his
best
to
create
the
impression
that
he
was
used
up
exhausted
broken
down
by
excesses
and
dissipation
for
that
is
the
fashion
the
latest
fancy
chic
will
you
never
have
done
growled
chupin
you
shall
pay
for
this
you
little
wretch
he
was
so
indignant
that
the
gamin
element
in
his
nature
stirred
again
under
his
fine
broadcloth
and
he
had
a
wild
longing
to
throw
stones
at
wilkie
he
would
certainly
have
trodden
on
his
heels
and
have
picked
a
quarrel
with
him
had
it
not
been
for
a
fear
of
failing
in
his
mission
and
thereby
losing
his
promised
reward
he
followed
his
man
closely
for
the
crowd
was
very
great
light
was
coming
on
and
the
gas
was
lit
on
all
sides
the
weather
was
very
mild
and
there
was
not
an
unoccupied
table
in
front
of
the
cafes
for
it
was
now
the
absinthe
hour
how
does
it
happen
that
every
evening
between
five
and
seven
o
clock
every
one
in
paris
who
is
known
who
is
somebody
or
something
can
be
found
between
the
passage
de
l
opera
and
the
passage
jouffroy
hereabout
you
may
hear
all
the
latest
news
and
gossip
of
the
fashionable
world
the
last
political
canards
all
the
incidents
of
parisian
life
which
will
be
recorded
by
the
papers
on
the
following
morning
you
may
learn
the
price
of
stocks
and
obtain
tips
for
s
bourse
ascertain
how
much
mademoiselle
a
s
necklace
cost
and
who
gave
it
to
her
with
the
latest
news
from
prussia
and
the
name
of
the
bank
chairman
or
cashier
who
has
absconded
during
the
day
and
the
amount
he
has
taken
with
him
the
crowd
became
more
dense
as
the
faubourg
montmartre
was
approached
but
wilkie
made
his
way
through
the
throng
with
the
ease
of
an
old
boulevardier
he
must
have
had
a
large
circle
of
acquaintances
for
he
distributed
bows
right
and
left
and
was
spoken
to
by
five
or
six
promenaders
he
did
not
pass
the
terrasse
jouffroy
but
pausing
there
he
purchased
an
evening
paper
retraced
his
steps
and
about
seven
o
clock
reached
the
cafe
riche
which
he
entered
triumphantly
he
did
not
even
touch
the
rim
of
his
hat
on
going
in
that
would
have
been
excessively
bad
form
but
he
called
a
waiter
in
a
very
loud
voice
and
imperiously
ordered
him
to
serve
dinner
on
a
table
near
the
window
where
he
could
see
the
boulevard
and
be
seen
and
now
my
little
is
going
to
feed
thought
chupin
he
too
was
hungry
and
he
was
trying
to
think
of
some
modest
restaurant
in
the
neighborhood
when
two
young
men
passed
near
him
and
glanced
into
the
cafe
look
there
s
wilkie
observed
one
of
them
that
s
so
upon
my
word
responded
the
other
and
he
has
money
too
fortune
has
smiled
upon
how
do
you
know
that
why
by
watching
the
fellow
one
can
tell
the
condition
of
his
purse
as
correctly
as
he
could
himself
if
his
funds
are
low
he
has
his
meals
brought
to
his
room
from
a
where
he
has
credit
his
mustache
droops
despondingly
he
is
humble
even
to
servility
with
his
friends
and
he
brushes
his
hair
over
his
forehead
when
he
is
in
average
circumstances
he
dines
at
launay
s
waxes
his
mustache
and
brushes
his
hair
back
from
his
face
but
when
he
dines
at
the
cafe
riche
my
boy
when
he
has
dyed
his
mustache
and
tips
his
hat
over
his
ear
and
deports
himself
in
that
arrogant
fashion
why
he
has
at
least
five
or
six
thousand
francs
in
his
pocket
and
all
is
well
with
where
does
he
get
his
money
from
who
can
tell
is
he
rich
he
must
have
plenty
of
money
i
lent
him
ten
louis
once
and
he
paid
me
zounds
he
s
a
very
honorable
fellow
thereupon
the
two
young
men
laughed
and
passed
on
chupin
had
been
greatly
edified
now
i
know
you
as
well
as
if
i
were
your
concierge
he
muttered
addressing
the
unconscious
wilkie
and
when
i
ve
followed
you
home
and
learned
your
number
i
shall
have
richly
earned
the
fifty
francs
fortunat
promised
as
well
as
he
could
judge
through
the
windowpane
wilkie
was
eating
his
dinner
with
an
excellent
appetite
ah
he
exclaimed
not
without
envy
these
take
good
care
of
their
stomachs
he
s
there
for
an
hour
at
least
and
i
shall
have
time
to
run
and
swallow
a
mouthful
so
saying
chupin
hastened
to
a
small
restaurant
in
a
neighboring
street
and
magnificently
disbursed
the
sum
of
sous
such
extravagance
was
unusual
on
his
part
for
he
had
lived
very
frugally
since
he
had
taken
a
vow
to
become
rich
formerly
when
he
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
to
use
his
own
expression
he
indulged
in
cigars
and
in
absinthe
but
now
he
contented
himself
with
the
fare
of
an
anchorite
drank
nothing
but
water
and
only
smoked
when
some
one
gave
him
a
cigar
nor
was
this
any
great
privation
to
him
since
he
gained
a
penny
by
it
and
a
penny
was
another
grain
of
sand
added
to
the
foundation
of
his
future
wealth
however
this
evening
he
indulged
in
the
extravagance
of
a
glass
of
wine
deciding
in
his
own
mind
that
he
had
fairly
earned
it
when
he
returned
to
his
post
in
front
of
the
cafe
riche
wilkie
was
no
longer
alone
at
his
table
he
was
finishing
his
coffee
in
the
company
of
a
man
of
his
own
age
who
was
remarkably
almost
too
in
fact
and
a
glance
at
whom
caused
chupin
to
exclaim
what
what
i
ve
seen
that
face
somewhere
before
but
he
racked
his
brain
in
vain
in
trying
to
remember
who
this
newcomer
was
in
trying
to
set
a
name
on
this
face
which
was
positively
annoying
in
its
classical
beauty
and
which
he
felt
convinced
had
occupied
a
place
among
the
phantoms
of
his
past
irritated
beyond
endurance
by
what
he
termed
his
stupidity
he
was
trying
to
decide
whether
he
should
enter
the
cafe
or
not
when
he
saw
wilkie
take
his
bill
from
the
hands
of
a
waiter
glance
at
it
and
throw
a
louis
on
the
table
his
companion
had
drawn
out
his
pocketbook
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
paying
for
the
coffee
he
had
taken
but
wilkie
with
a
cordial
gesture
forbade
it
and
made
that
magnificent
imperious
sign
to
the
waiter
which
so
clearly
implies
take
nothing
all
is
paid
keep
the
thereupon
the
servant
gravely
retired
more
than
ever
convinced
of
the
fact
that
vanity
increases
the
fabulous
total
of
parisian
gratuities
by
more
than
a
million
francs
a
year
my
gallant
youths
are
coming
out
thought
chupin
i
must
keep
my
ears
and
approaching
the
door
he
dropped
on
one
knee
and
pretended
to
be
engaged
in
tying
his
shoestrings
this
is
one
of
the
thousand
expedients
adopted
by
spies
and
inquisitive
people
and
when
a
man
is
foolish
enough
to
tell
his
secrets
in
the
street
he
should
at
least
be
wise
enough
to
distrust
the
people
near
him
who
pretend
to
be
absorbed
in
something
else
for
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
these
persons
are
listening
to
him
possibly
for
pay
or
possibly
from
curiosity
however
the
young
men
whom
chupin
was
watching
were
far
from
suspecting
that
they
were
under
surveillance
wilkie
came
out
first
talking
very
loud
as
often
happens
when
a
man
has
just
partaken
of
a
good
dinner
and
is
blessed
with
an
excellent
digestion
come
coralth
my
good
fellow
you
won
t
desert
me
in
this
way
i
have
a
box
for
the
varietes
and
you
must
go
with
me
we
ll
see
if
silly
imitates
theresa
as
perfectly
as
they
but
i
have
an
oh
well
let
it
wait
come
viscount
is
it
agreed
ah
you
do
with
me
just
as
you
good
but
first
of
all
let
us
take
a
glass
of
beer
to
finish
our
cigars
and
do
you
know
whom
you
will
find
in
my
box
at
this
moment
they
passed
and
chupin
rose
to
his
feet
coralth
he
muttered
viscount
de
coralth
he
s
not
one
of
our
clients
let
me
see
coralth
this
is
certainly
the
first
time
i
have
ever
heard
the
name
can
it
be
that
i
m
mistaken
impossible
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
thoroughly
he
became
convinced
of
the
accuracy
of
his
first
impression
consoling
himself
with
the
thought
that
a
name
has
but
a
slight
significance
after
all
his
preoccupation
had
at
least
the
advantage
of
shortening
the
time
which
he
spent
in
promenading
to
and
fro
while
the
friends
sat
outside
a
cafe
smoking
and
drinking
it
was
still
wilkie
who
monopolized
the
conversation
while
his
companion
listened
with
his
elbow
resting
on
the
table
occasionally
nodding
his
head
in
token
of
approbation
one
thing
that
incensed
chupin
was
that
they
loitered
there
when
one
of
them
had
a
ticket
for
a
box
at
the
theatre
in
his
pocket
idiots
he
growled
they
ll
wait
till
the
play
s
half
over
before
they
go
in
and
then
they
ll
let
the
doors
slam
behind
them
for
the
express
purpose
of
disturbing
everybody
fools
go
as
if
they
had
heard
the
command
they
rose
suddenly
and
an
instant
after
they
entered
the
varietes
they
entered
but
chupin
remained
on
the
pavement
scratching
his
head
furiously
in
accordance
with
his
habit
whenever
he
wished
to
develop
his
powers
of
imagination
he
was
trying
to
think
how
he
might
procure
admission
to
the
theatre
without
paying
for
it
for
several
years
he
had
seen
every
play
put
upon
the
stage
in
paris
without
spending
a
sou
and
he
felt
that
it
would
be
actually
degrading
to
purchase
a
ticket
at
the
office
now
pay
to
see
a
farce
he
thought
not
i
must
know
some
one
here
i
ll
wait
for
the
entr
the
wisdom
of
this
course
became
apparent
when
among
those
who
left
the
theatre
at
the
close
of
the
first
act
he
recognized
an
old
acquaintance
who
was
now
working
on
the
claque
and
who
at
once
procured
him
a
ticket
of
admission
for
nothing
well
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
friends
everywhere
he
muttered
as
he
took
the
seat
assigned
him
it
was
a
very
good
place
they
had
given
him
a
seat
in
the
second
gallery
commanding
an
excellent
view
of
the
house
the
first
glance
around
told
him
that
his
customers
as
he
styled
them
were
in
a
box
exactly
opposite
they
were
now
in
the
company
of
two
damsels
in
startling
toilettes
with
exceedingly
dishevelled
yellow
hair
who
moved
restlessly
about
and
giggled
and
stared
and
tried
in
every
possible
way
to
attract
attention
and
their
stratagem
succeeded
however
this
did
not
seem
to
please
the
viscount
de
coralth
who
kept
himself
as
far
back
in
the
shade
as
he
possibly
could
but
young
wilkie
was
evidently
delighted
and
seemed
manifestly
proud
of
the
attention
which
the
public
was
compelled
to
bestow
upon
his
box
he
offered
himself
as
much
as
possible
to
the
gaze
of
the
audience
moved
about
leaned
forward
and
made
himself
fully
as
conspicuous
as
his
fair
companions
less
than
ever
did
chupin
now
forgive
wilkie
for
the
insult
he
had
cast
in
the
face
of
madame
lia
d
argeles
who
was
probably
his
mother
as
for
the
play
fortunat
s
emissary
did
not
hear
twenty
words
of
it
he
was
so
overcome
with
fatigue
that
he
soon
fell
asleep
the
noise
and
bustle
of
each
entr
acte
aroused
him
a
little
but
he
did
not
thoroughly
wake
up
until
the
close
of
the
performance
his
customers
were
still
in
their
box
and
wilkie
was
gallantly
wrapping
the
ladies
in
their
cloaks
and
shawls
in
the
vestibule
he
and
de
coralth
were
joined
by
several
other
young
men
and
the
whole
party
adjourned
to
a
neighboring
cafe
these
people
are
certainly
afflicted
with
an
unquenchable
thirst
growled
chupin
i
wonder
if
this
is
their
everyday
life
he
too
was
thirsty
after
his
hastily
eaten
dinner
and
necessity
prevailing
over
economy
he
seated
himself
at
a
table
outside
the
cafe
and
called
for
a
glass
of
beer
in
which
he
moistened
his
parched
lips
with
a
sigh
of
intense
satisfaction
he
sipped
the
beverage
slowly
in
order
to
make
it
last
the
longer
but
this
did
not
prevent
his
glass
from
becoming
dry
long
before
wilkie
and
his
friends
were
ready
to
leave
it
seems
to
me
we
are
going
to
stay
here
all
night
he
thought
angrily
his
was
not
strange
under
the
circumstances
for
it
was
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
after
carrying
all
the
tables
and
chairs
round
about
inside
a
waiter
came
to
ask
chupin
to
go
away
all
the
other
cafes
were
closing
too
and
the
fastening
of
bolts
or
the
clanking
of
shutter
chains
could
be
heard
on
every
side
on
the
pavement
stood
groups
of
waiters
in
their
stretching
and
yawning
and
inhaling
the
fresh
night
air
with
delight
the
boulevard
was
fast
becoming
deserted
the
men
were
going
off
in
little
groups
and
female
forms
could
be
seen
gliding
along
in
the
dark
shadow
cast
by
the
houses
the
police
were
watching
everywhere
with
a
word
of
menace
ever
ready
on
their
lips
and
soon
the
only
means
of
egress
from
the
cafes
were
the
narrow
low
doorways
cut
in
the
shutters
through
which
the
last
customers
the
insatiable
who
are
always
ordering
one
thimbleful
more
to
finish
passed
out
it
was
through
a
portal
of
this
sort
that
wilkie
and
his
companions
at
last
emerged
and
on
perceiving
them
chupin
gave
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
at
last
he
thought
i
can
follow
the
man
to
his
door
take
his
number
and
go
but
his
joy
was
for
wilkie
proposed
that
the
whole
party
should
go
and
take
supper
de
coralth
demurred
to
the
idea
but
the
others
his
objections
and
dragged
him
away
with
them
xix
ah
this
is
a
bad
job
growled
chupin
go
go
and
never
stop
what
exasperated
him
even
more
than
his
want
of
sleep
was
the
thought
that
his
good
mother
must
be
waiting
for
him
at
home
in
an
agony
of
anxiety
for
since
his
reformation
he
had
become
remarkably
regular
in
his
habits
what
should
he
do
go
home
said
reason
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
find
this
wilkie
again
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
lives
at
no
in
the
rue
du
remain
whispered
avarice
and
since
you
have
accomplished
so
much
finish
your
work
fortunat
won
t
pay
for
conjectures
but
for
a
love
of
money
carried
the
day
so
weaving
an
interminable
chaplet
of
oaths
he
followed
the
party
until
they
entered
brebant
s
restaurant
one
of
the
best
known
establishments
which
remain
open
at
it
was
nearly
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
now
the
boulevard
was
silent
and
deserted
and
yet
this
restaurant
was
brilliantly
lighted
from
top
to
bottom
and
snatches
of
song
and
shouts
of
laughter
with
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
and
the
clink
of
glasses
could
be
heard
through
the
half
opened
windows
eight
dozen
marennes
for
no
shouted
a
waiter
to
the
man
who
opened
oysters
near
the
restaurant
door
on
hearing
this
order
chupin
shook
his
clenched
fist
at
the
stars
the
wretches
he
muttered
through
his
set
teeth
bad
luck
to
them
those
oysters
are
for
their
mouths
plainly
enough
for
there
are
eight
of
them
in
all
counting
those
women
they
will
no
doubt
remain
at
table
until
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
they
call
this
enjoying
themselves
and
meanwhile
poor
little
chupin
must
wear
out
his
on
the
pavement
ah
they
shall
pay
for
this
it
ought
to
have
been
some
consolation
to
him
to
see
that
he
was
not
alone
in
his
misery
for
in
front
of
the
restaurant
stood
a
dozen
cabs
with
sleepy
drivers
who
were
waiting
for
chance
to
send
them
one
of
those
passengers
who
refuse
to
pay
more
than
fifteen
sous
for
their
fare
but
give
their
jehu
a
gratuity
of
a
louis
all
these
vehicles
belonged
to
the
peculiar
category
known
as
night
cabs
dilapidated
conveyances
with
soiled
ragged
linings
and
drawn
by
jaded
horses
however
chupin
neither
thought
of
these
vehicles
nor
of
the
poor
horses
nor
indeed
of
the
drivers
themselves
his
wrath
had
been
succeeded
by
philosophical
resignation
he
accepted
with
good
grace
what
he
could
not
avoid
as
the
night
air
had
become
very
cool
he
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
and
began
to
pace
to
and
fro
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
restaurant
he
had
made
a
hundred
turns
perhaps
passing
the
events
of
the
day
in
review
when
suddenly
such
a
strange
and
startling
idea
flashed
across
his
mind
that
he
stood
motionless
lost
in
astonishment
reflecting
on
the
manner
in
which
wilkie
and
the
viscount
de
coralth
had
behaved
during
the
evening
a
singular
suspicion
assailed
him
while
wilkie
gradually
lost
his
wits
de
coralth
had
become
remarkably
cold
and
reserved
he
had
seemed
to
oppose
all
wilkie
s
propositions
but
he
had
agreed
to
them
at
last
so
that
his
objections
had
produced
much
the
same
effect
as
a
stimulant
it
seemed
then
as
if
de
coralth
had
some
strange
interest
in
wishing
to
gain
ascendency
over
his
friend
at
least
such
was
chupin
s
opinion
oh
oh
he
murmured
what
if
he
should
be
working
up
the
same
little
scheme
what
if
he
were
acquainted
with
madame
lia
d
argeles
what
if
he
knew
that
there
s
a
fortune
waiting
for
a
claimant
i
shouldn
t
at
all
be
surprised
if
i
found
that
he
wanted
to
cook
his
bread
in
our
oven
but
father
fortunat
wouldn
t
be
pleased
with
the
news
ah
no
he
wouldn
t
even
smile
while
carrying
on
this
little
conversation
with
himself
he
stood
just
in
front
of
the
restaurant
looking
up
into
the
air
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
window
was
thrown
noisily
open
and
the
figures
of
two
men
became
plainly
visible
they
were
engaged
in
a
friendly
struggle
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
trying
to
seize
hold
of
something
which
the
other
had
in
his
hand
and
which
he
refused
to
part
with
one
of
these
men
was
wilkie
as
chupin
at
once
perceived
good
he
said
to
himself
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
as
he
spoke
wilkie
s
hat
fell
on
the
slipped
off
and
dropped
on
to
the
pavement
below
with
a
natural
impulse
chupin
picked
it
up
and
he
was
turning
it
over
and
over
in
his
hands
when
wilkie
leant
out
of
the
window
and
shouted
in
a
voice
that
was
thick
with
wine
halloo
eh
there
who
picked
up
my
hat
honesty
shall
be
rewarded
a
glass
of
champagne
and
a
cigar
for
the
fellow
who
ll
bring
it
me
in
room
no
chupin
hesitated
by
going
up
he
might
perhaps
compromise
the
success
of
his
mission
but
on
the
other
hand
his
curiosity
was
aroused
and
he
very
much
wished
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
how
these
young
men
were
amusing
themselves
besides
he
would
have
an
opportunity
of
examining
this
handsome
viscount
whom
he
was
certain
he
had
met
before
though
he
could
not
tell
when
or
where
in
the
meantime
wilkie
had
perceived
him
come
you
simpleton
he
cried
make
haste
you
can
t
be
very
the
thought
of
the
viscount
decided
chupin
entering
the
restaurant
and
climbing
the
staircase
he
had
just
reached
the
landing
when
a
man
who
had
a
face
and
was
dressed
in
black
barred
his
way
and
asked
what
do
you
want
m
sieur
here
s
a
hat
which
fell
from
one
of
your
windows
and
all
right
hand
it
but
chupin
did
not
seem
to
hear
this
order
he
was
beginning
a
long
explanation
when
a
curtain
near
by
was
pushed
aside
and
wilkie
called
out
philippe
eh
philippe
bring
me
the
man
who
picked
up
my
ah
said
chupin
you
see
m
sieur
that
he
asks
for
very
well
said
philippe
go
on
and
raising
the
portiere
he
pushed
chupin
into
room
no
it
was
a
small
square
apartment
with
a
very
low
ceiling
the
temperature
was
like
that
of
a
furnace
and
the
glare
of
the
gaslights
almost
blinded
one
the
supper
was
over
but
the
table
had
not
yet
been
cleared
and
plates
full
of
leavings
showed
that
the
guests
had
fairly
exhausted
their
appetites
still
with
the
exception
of
wilkie
every
one
present
seemed
to
be
terribly
bored
in
one
corner
with
her
head
resting
on
a
piano
sat
one
of
the
damsels
fast
asleep
while
beside
the
window
de
coralth
was
smoking
with
his
elbows
propped
upon
the
table
the
four
other
young
men
were
looking
on
phlegmatically
ah
here
s
my
hat
exclaimed
wilkie
as
soon
as
chupin
appeared
wait
and
receive
your
promised
and
thereupon
he
rang
the
bell
crying
at
the
top
of
his
voice
henry
you
a
clean
glass
and
some
more
of
the
widow
cliquot
s
champagne
several
bottles
were
standing
upon
the
table
only
half
empty
and
one
of
wilkie
s
friends
called
his
attention
to
this
fact
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
disdainfully
you
must
take
me
for
a
fool
he
said
contemptuously
a
man
doesn
t
drink
stale
wine
when
he
has
the
prospect
of
such
an
inheritance
as
is
coming
to
wilkie
interrupted
de
coralth
quickly
wilkie
but
he
was
too
late
chupin
had
heard
and
understood
everything
his
conjectures
had
proved
correct
wilkie
knew
his
right
to
the
estate
fortunat
had
been
forestalled
by
the
viscount
and
would
merely
have
his
labor
for
his
pains
no
chance
for
the
guv
nor
thought
the
agent
s
emissary
and
what
a
blow
after
the
de
valorsay
affair
it
s
enough
to
give
him
the
jaundice
for
a
youth
of
his
age
chupin
controlled
his
feelings
admirably
but
the
revelation
came
so
suddenly
that
he
had
started
despite
himself
and
changed
color
a
trifle
de
coralth
saw
this
and
though
he
was
far
from
suspecting
the
truth
his
long
repressed
anger
burst
forth
he
rose
abruptly
took
up
a
bottle
and
filling
the
nearest
glass
he
rudely
exclaimed
come
drink
that
make
haste
and
clear
out
victor
chupin
must
have
become
very
sensitive
since
his
conversion
in
former
times
he
was
not
wont
to
be
so
susceptible
as
to
lose
his
temper
when
some
one
chanced
to
address
him
in
a
rather
peremptory
manner
or
to
offer
him
wine
out
of
the
first
available
glass
but
de
coralth
inspired
him
with
one
of
those
inexplicable
aversions
which
can
not
be
restrained
eh
tell
me
if
it
s
because
we
ve
drank
champagne
together
before
that
you
talk
to
me
like
that
the
young
fellow
retorted
savagely
it
was
only
a
random
shot
but
it
reached
home
the
viscount
seemed
touched
to
the
quick
you
hear
that
wilkie
said
he
this
will
teach
you
that
the
time
of
your
compatriot
lord
seymour
has
passed
by
the
race
of
plebeians
who
respectfully
submitted
to
the
blows
with
which
noblemen
honored
them
after
drinking
has
died
out
this
ought
to
cure
you
of
your
unfortunate
habit
of
placing
yourself
on
terms
of
equality
with
all
the
vagabonds
you
chupin
s
hair
fairly
bristled
with
anger
what
what
he
exclaimed
i
ll
teach
you
to
call
me
a
vagabond
you
scoundrel
his
gesture
his
attitude
and
his
eyes
were
so
expressive
of
defiance
and
menace
that
two
of
the
guests
sprang
up
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
go
go
they
said
but
he
freed
himself
from
their
grasp
go
he
replied
never
he
called
me
a
vagabond
am
i
to
pocket
the
insult
quietly
and
walk
off
with
it
you
can
scarcely
expect
that
first
i
demand
an
this
was
asking
too
much
of
the
viscount
de
coralth
let
the
fool
alone
he
remarked
with
affected
coolness
and
ring
for
the
waiters
to
kick
him
it
did
not
require
this
new
insult
to
put
chupin
in
a
furious
passion
come
on
he
exclaimed
ah
ha
where
s
the
fellow
who
ll
turn
me
out
let
him
come
i
ll
teach
him
a
lesson
and
as
he
spoke
he
squared
his
shoulders
inflated
his
chest
and
threw
the
weight
of
his
entire
body
on
his
left
leg
after
the
most
approved
method
of
go
go
insisted
wilkie
s
friends
yes
i
ll
go
with
pleasure
but
your
friend
must
go
too
is
he
a
man
then
let
him
come
and
we
ll
settle
this
and
seeing
that
they
were
again
trying
to
seize
him
hands
off
he
thundered
or
i
ll
strike
you
were
not
obliged
to
invite
me
here
it
isn
t
my
business
to
furnish
amusement
to
parties
who
ve
drunk
too
much
wine
and
why
should
you
despise
me
it
s
true
i
haven
t
any
money
while
you
have
plenty
that
i
work
and
you
carouse
still
that
s
no
reason
why
you
should
scorn
me
besides
those
who
are
poor
in
the
morning
are
sometimes
rich
in
the
evening
every
dog
has
his
day
i
have
an
idea
that
i
shall
have
some
coin
when
yours
is
all
gone
then
it
will
be
my
turn
to
laugh
and
as
i
m
a
fellow
i
will
give
you
my
wilkie
seemed
delighted
he
had
climbed
on
to
the
piano
and
seated
himself
with
his
feet
on
the
keyboard
and
there
as
on
a
judgment
seat
he
listened
and
applauded
alternately
taking
chupin
s
part
and
then
the
viscount
s
bravo
gamin
or
give
it
to
him
coralth
he
shouted
in
turn
this
irritated
the
viscount
exceedingly
i
see
that
we
shall
be
obliged
to
call
in
the
police
to
settle
the
affair
he
said
sneeringly
the
police
roared
chupin
ah
that
won
t
do
you
scamp
but
his
voice
died
away
in
his
throat
and
he
stood
motionless
speechless
with
his
arm
raised
as
if
he
were
about
to
strike
and
his
eyes
dilated
with
astonishment
for
a
change
of
expression
in
de
coralth
s
face
had
enlightened
him
and
he
suddenly
recollected
when
and
under
what
circumstances
he
had
known
this
viscount
he
remembered
too
the
name
he
had
borne
when
he
first
met
him
oh
he
stammered
oh
oh
however
the
effect
of
this
discovery
was
to
dispel
his
anger
or
rather
to
restore
his
calmness
and
addressing
de
coralth
he
exclaimed
don
t
be
angry
at
what
i
ve
said
m
sieur
it
was
only
a
jest
i
know
that
there
s
a
wide
difference
between
a
poor
devil
like
me
and
a
viscount
like
you
i
haven
t
a
sou
you
see
and
that
maddens
me
but
i
m
not
so
very
fortunately
and
i
m
always
hoping
that
the
daughter
of
some
rich
banker
will
fall
in
love
with
me
and
marry
me
some
people
have
such
luck
you
know
if
i
meet
with
any
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
pass
myself
off
as
the
lost
child
of
some
great
personage
of
a
duke
for
instance
and
if
the
real
son
exists
and
troubles
me
why
i
ll
quietly
put
him
out
of
the
way
if
with
but
one
exception
the
persons
present
did
not
understand
a
single
word
of
this
apparent
nonsense
and
indeed
the
damsels
stared
at
the
speaker
in
amazement
still
it
was
evident
that
each
of
these
words
had
a
meaning
and
a
terrible
meaning
for
de
coralth
accustomed
for
years
to
control
his
features
he
remained
apparently
unmoved
he
even
smiled
but
a
close
observer
could
have
detected
anguish
in
his
eyes
and
he
had
become
very
pale
at
last
unable
to
endure
the
scene
any
longer
he
drew
a
from
his
pocketbook
crumpled
it
in
his
hand
and
threw
it
at
chupin
saying
that
s
a
very
pretty
story
you
are
telling
my
boy
but
we
ve
had
enough
of
it
take
your
pay
and
leave
unfortunately
the
note
struck
chupin
full
in
the
face
he
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
of
rage
and
by
the
way
in
which
he
seized
and
brandished
an
empty
bottle
it
might
have
been
imagined
that
de
coralth
was
about
to
have
his
head
broken
but
no
thanks
to
a
supreme
effort
of
will
chupin
conquered
this
mad
fury
and
dropping
the
bottle
he
remarked
to
the
young
women
who
were
uttering
shrieks
be
quiet
don
t
you
see
that
i
was
only
in
but
even
wilkie
had
found
the
fun
a
little
rough
and
even
dangerous
several
of
the
young
fellows
present
sprang
up
with
the
evident
intention
of
pushing
chupin
out
of
the
room
but
he
checked
them
with
a
gesture
don
t
disturb
yourselves
gentlemen
he
said
i
m
going
only
let
me
find
the
which
this
gentleman
threw
at
that
s
quite
proper
replied
wilkie
approvingly
look
for
chupin
did
so
and
at
last
found
it
lying
almost
under
the
piano
now
he
remarked
i
should
like
a
a
score
or
so
were
lying
in
a
dish
he
gravely
selected
one
of
them
and
coolly
cut
off
the
end
of
it
before
placing
it
in
his
mouth
those
around
watched
him
with
an
air
of
profound
astonishment
not
understanding
this
ironical
calmness
following
so
closely
upon
such
a
storm
of
passion
then
he
victor
chupin
who
had
it
seems
to
me
but
one
aim
in
life
to
become
rich
victor
chupin
who
loved
money
above
anything
else
and
had
stifled
all
other
passions
in
his
soul
he
who
often
worked
two
whole
days
to
earn
five
francs
he
who
did
not
disdain
to
claim
his
five
sous
when
he
went
to
hire
a
cab
for
his
employer
he
chupin
twisted
the
in
his
fingers
lit
it
at
the
gas
and
used
it
to
light
his
cigar
ah
he
s
crazy
murmured
the
damsels
with
despair
in
their
voices
but
wilkie
was
enthusiastic
there
s
form
said
he
fine
form
and
no
mistake
but
chupin
did
not
even
deign
to
turn
his
head
he
opened
the
door
and
standing
on
the
threshold
he
bowed
to
de
coralth
with
an
ironical
smile
until
we
meet
again
monsieur
paul
said
he
and
kindly
remember
me
to
madame
paul
if
you
if
the
others
had
been
less
astonished
they
would
have
no
doubt
have
remarked
the
prodigious
effect
of
this
name
upon
their
brilliant
friend
he
became
ghastly
pale
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
then
suddenly
he
bounded
up
as
if
he
wished
to
attack
his
enemy
but
pursuit
seemed
likely
to
yield
no
result
for
chupin
was
already
on
the
boulevard
it
was
daybreak
paris
was
waking
up
the
bakers
were
standing
at
their
doors
and
boys
in
their
with
their
eyes
swollen
with
sleep
were
taking
down
the
shutters
of
the
a
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
the
hung
in
the
distance
the
wandered
about
peering
among
the
rubbish
the
noisy
jolted
along
at
a
gallop
and
workmen
were
proceeding
to
their
daily
toil
with
hunches
of
bread
in
their
hands
the
morning
air
was
very
chilly
nevertheless
chupin
seated
himself
on
a
bench
across
the
boulevard
at
a
spot
where
he
could
watch
the
entrance
of
the
restaurant
without
being
seen
he
had
just
experienced
one
of
those
sudden
shocks
which
so
disturb
the
mind
that
one
becomes
insensible
to
outward
circumstances
whatever
they
may
be
he
had
recognized
in
the
viscount
de
coralth
the
man
whom
he
had
hated
above
all
others
in
the
world
or
rather
the
only
man
whom
he
hated
for
his
was
not
a
bad
heart
impressionable
to
excess
like
a
true
child
of
the
faubourgs
he
had
the
parisian
s
strange
mobility
of
feeling
if
his
anger
was
kindled
by
a
trifle
the
merest
nothing
usually
sufficed
to
extinguish
it
but
matters
were
different
respecting
this
handsome
viscount
god
how
i
hate
him
he
hissed
through
his
set
teeth
god
how
i
hate
him
for
once
years
before
as
he
had
confessed
to
fortunat
chupin
had
been
guilty
of
a
cowardly
and
abominable
act
which
had
nearly
cost
a
man
his
life
and
this
crime
if
it
had
been
successful
would
have
benefited
the
very
fellow
who
concealed
his
sinful
shameful
past
under
the
name
of
coralth
how
was
it
that
chupin
had
not
recognized
him
at
once
because
he
had
worked
for
this
fellow
without
knowing
him
receiving
his
orders
through
the
miserable
wretches
who
pandered
to
his
vices
he
had
only
seen
him
personally
once
or
twice
and
had
never
spoken
to
him
later
too
late
he
discovered
what
vile
intrigue
it
was
that
he
had
served
and
when
he
became
sincerely
repentant
he
loathed
this
coralth
who
had
caused
his
crime
nor
was
this
all
the
recognition
of
coralth
had
inspired
him
with
remorse
it
had
aroused
in
the
recesses
of
his
conscience
a
threatening
voice
which
cried
what
are
you
doing
here
you
are
acting
as
a
spy
for
a
man
you
distrust
and
whose
real
designs
you
are
ignorant
of
it
was
in
this
way
you
began
before
have
you
forgotten
what
it
led
to
have
you
not
sin
enough
already
upon
your
conscience
blood
enough
upon
your
hands
it
is
folly
to
pretend
that
one
may
serve
as
a
tool
for
villains
and
still
remain
an
honest
man
it
was
this
voice
which
had
given
chupin
the
courage
to
light
his
cigar
with
the
and
this
voice
still
tortured
him
as
seated
on
the
bench
he
now
tried
to
review
the
situation
where
indeed
was
he
with
rare
good
luck
he
had
discovered
the
son
whom
madame
lia
d
argeles
had
so
long
and
successfully
concealed
but
contrary
to
all
expectations
this
young
fellow
already
knew
of
the
inheritance
which
he
was
entitled
to
de
coralth
had
already
achieved
what
fortunat
had
meant
to
do
and
so
the
plan
was
a
failure
and
it
was
useless
to
persist
in
it
this
would
have
ended
the
matter
if
chupin
had
not
chanced
to
know
the
viscount
de
coralth
s
shameful
past
and
this
knowledge
changed
everything
for
it
gave
him
the
power
to
interfere
in
a
most
effectual
manner
armed
with
this
secret
he
could
bestow
the
victory
on
fortunat
and
force
de
coralth
to
capitulate
and
he
could
do
this
all
the
more
easily
as
he
was
sure
that
coralth
had
not
recognized
him
and
that
he
was
perhaps
ignorant
of
his
very
existence
chupin
had
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
a
sudden
impulse
of
anger
which
he
regretted
he
had
made
an
ironical
illusion
to
his
enemy
s
past
life
but
after
all
this
had
done
no
particular
harm
so
nothing
prevented
him
from
lending
fortunat
his
assistance
and
thus
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
he
could
have
his
revenge
on
coralth
and
at
the
same
time
insure
his
patron
a
large
fee
of
which
he
could
claim
a
considerable
share
for
himself
but
no
the
idea
of
deriving
any
profit
whatever
from
this
affair
inspired
him
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
honor
triumphed
over
his
naturally
crafty
and
avaricious
nature
it
seemed
to
him
that
any
money
made
in
this
way
would
soil
his
fingers
for
he
realized
there
must
be
some
deep
villainy
under
all
this
plotting
and
planning
he
was
sure
of
it
since
coralth
was
mixed
up
in
the
affair
i
will
serve
my
guv
nor
for
nothing
he
decided
when
a
man
is
avenged
he
s
well
chupin
decided
upon
this
course
because
he
could
think
of
no
better
plan
still
if
he
had
been
master
of
events
he
would
have
acted
otherwise
he
would
have
quietly
presented
the
government
with
this
inheritance
which
he
found
wilkie
so
unworthy
of
the
devil
only
knows
what
he
ll
do
with
it
he
thought
he
ll
squander
it
as
my
father
squandered
the
fortune
that
was
given
him
it
is
only
fools
who
meet
with
such
luck
as
however
his
meditations
did
not
prevent
him
from
keeping
a
close
watch
over
the
restaurant
for
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
wilkie
should
not
escape
him
it
was
now
broad
daylight
and
customers
were
leaving
the
establishment
for
after
passing
what
is
generally
conceded
to
be
a
joyous
night
they
felt
the
need
of
returning
home
to
rest
and
sleep
chupin
watched
them
as
they
emerged
there
were
some
who
came
out
with
drooping
heads
mumbling
incoherent
phrases
while
others
who
were
equally
intoxicated
but
more
nervous
evinced
considerable
animation
and
sang
snatches
of
songs
or
jested
loudly
with
the
as
they
passed
on
the
more
sober
surprised
by
the
sunlight
and
blushing
at
themselves
slunk
hastily
and
quietly
away
there
was
one
man
moreover
whom
the
waiters
were
obliged
to
carry
to
his
cab
for
he
could
no
longer
stand
on
his
feet
at
last
chupin
saw
the
individual
clad
in
black
whom
wilkie
had
addressed
as
philippe
and
who
had
endeavored
to
prevent
him
from
entering
the
restaurant
come
out
and
walk
rapidly
away
he
was
warmly
clad
in
a
thick
overcoat
but
he
shivered
and
his
pale
wan
face
betrayed
the
man
who
is
a
martyr
to
the
pleasures
of
others
the
man
who
is
condemned
to
be
up
all
night
and
sleep
only
in
the
daytime
the
man
who
can
tell
you
how
much
folly
and
beastliness
lurk
in
the
depths
of
the
and
who
knows
exactly
how
many
yawns
are
expressed
by
the
verb
to
amuse
one
s
chupin
was
beginning
to
feel
uneasy
can
wilkie
and
his
friends
have
made
their
escape
he
wondered
but
at
that
very
moment
they
made
their
appearance
they
lingered
awhile
on
the
pavement
to
chat
and
chupin
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
effect
of
their
night
s
dissipation
on
their
faces
the
brilliant
sunlight
made
their
eyes
blink
and
the
cold
sent
purple
blotches
to
their
bloated
cheeks
as
for
the
young
women
with
yellow
hair
they
appeared
as
they
really
were
hideous
they
entered
the
only
cab
that
remained
the
most
dilapidated
one
of
all
and
the
driver
of
which
had
no
little
difficulty
in
setting
his
horse
in
motion
whereupon
the
gentlemen
went
off
on
foot
many
persons
would
have
been
vexed
and
even
humiliated
by
the
necessity
of
appearing
at
this
hour
on
the
boulevard
in
disorderly
attire
which
plainly
indicated
that
they
had
spent
the
night
in
debauchery
but
with
the
exception
of
the
viscount
de
coralth
who
was
evidently
out
of
humor
the
party
seemed
delighted
with
themselves
as
it
was
easy
to
see
by
the
way
they
met
the
glances
of
the
they
considered
themselves
form
they
were
producing
an
effect
they
were
astonishing
people
and
what
more
could
they
desire
one
thing
is
certain
they
were
irritating
chupin
terribly
he
was
following
them
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
boulevard
at
some
little
distance
in
the
rear
for
he
was
afraid
of
being
recognized
the
wretches
he
growled
one
couldn
t
draw
a
pint
of
manly
blood
from
the
veins
of
all
six
of
them
ah
if
they
knew
how
i
hate
them
but
he
had
not
long
to
nurse
his
wrath
on
reaching
the
rue
drouot
two
of
the
gentlemen
left
the
party
and
two
more
went
down
the
rue
lepelletier
wilkie
and
the
viscount
were
left
to
walk
down
the
boulevard
alone
they
linked
their
arms
and
carried
on
an
animated
conversation
until
they
reached
the
rue
du
helder
where
they
shook
hands
and
separated
what
had
they
said
at
parting
what
agreement
had
been
made
between
them
chupin
would
willingly
have
given
a
hundred
sous
from
his
private
purse
to
have
known
he
would
have
given
as
much
more
to
have
been
able
to
double
himself
in
order
to
pursue
the
viscount
who
had
started
off
in
the
direction
of
the
madeleine
without
having
to
give
up
watching
and
following
his
friend
but
the
days
of
miracles
are
over
so
chupin
sighed
and
following
wilkie
he
soon
saw
him
enter
no
of
the
rue
du
helder
the
concierge
who
was
at
the
door
busily
engaged
in
polishing
the
bowed
respectfully
so
there
it
is
grumbled
chupin
i
knew
he
lived
there
i
knew
it
by
the
way
that
madame
d
argeles
looked
at
the
windows
yesterday
evening
poor
woman
ah
her
son
s
a
fine
fellow
and
no
mistake
his
compassion
for
the
unhappy
mother
seemed
to
recall
him
to
a
sense
of
duty
scoundrel
that
i
am
he
exclaimed
striking
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
fist
why
i
m
forgetting
my
own
good
mother
and
as
his
task
was
now
ended
he
started
off
on
the
run
taking
the
shortest
cut
to
the
faubourg
poor
mother
he
said
to
himself
as
he
tore
along
what
a
night
she
must
have
had
she
must
have
cried
her
eyes
out
he
spoke
the
truth
the
poor
woman
had
passed
a
night
of
agony
counting
the
hours
and
trembling
each
time
the
door
of
the
house
opened
announcing
some
tenant
s
return
and
as
morning
approached
her
anxiety
increased
for
her
son
would
not
have
allowed
her
to
remain
in
such
suspense
she
said
to
herself
unless
he
had
met
with
some
accident
or
encountered
some
of
his
former
friends
those
detestable
scamps
who
had
tried
to
make
him
as
vile
as
perhaps
he
had
met
his
father
polyte
chupin
the
man
whom
she
still
loved
in
spite
of
everything
because
he
was
her
husband
but
whom
she
judged
and
whom
indeed
she
knew
to
be
capable
of
any
crime
and
of
all
misfortunes
it
was
an
accident
even
a
fatal
accident
that
she
dreaded
least
in
her
heroic
soul
the
voice
of
honor
spoke
even
more
loudly
than
the
imperious
instinct
of
maternity
and
she
would
rather
have
found
her
son
lying
dead
on
the
marble
slabs
of
the
morgue
than
seated
in
the
dock
at
the
assize
court
her
poor
eyes
were
weary
of
weeping
when
she
at
last
recognized
victor
s
familiar
step
approaching
down
the
passage
she
hastily
opened
the
door
and
as
soon
as
she
felt
that
he
was
near
her
for
she
could
not
see
him
she
asked
where
have
you
spent
the
night
where
have
you
come
from
what
has
happened
his
only
answer
was
to
fling
his
arms
round
her
neck
following
alike
the
impulse
of
his
heart
and
the
advice
of
experience
which
told
him
that
this
would
be
the
best
explanation
he
could
give
still
it
did
not
prevent
him
from
trying
to
justify
himself
although
he
was
careful
not
to
confess
the
truth
for
he
dreaded
his
mother
s
censure
knowing
well
enough
that
she
would
be
less
indulgent
than
his
own
conscience
i
believe
you
my
son
said
the
good
woman
gravely
you
wouldn
t
deceive
me
i
m
and
she
added
what
reassured
me
when
you
kissed
me
was
that
you
hadn
t
been
chupin
did
not
speak
a
word
this
confidence
made
him
strangely
uneasy
may
i
be
hung
he
thought
if
after
this
i
ever
do
anything
that
i
can
t
confess
to
this
poor
good
woman
but
he
hadn
t
time
for
sentimental
reflections
he
had
gone
too
far
to
draw
back
and
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
report
the
result
of
his
researches
as
soon
as
possible
accordingly
he
hastily
ate
a
morsel
for
he
was
faint
with
hunger
and
started
out
again
promising
to
return
to
dinner
he
was
in
all
the
greater
haste
as
it
was
sunday
fortunat
was
in
the
habit
of
passing
these
days
in
the
country
and
chupin
feared
he
might
fail
to
see
him
if
he
was
not
expeditious
in
his
movements
and
while
running
to
the
place
de
la
bourse
he
carefully
prepared
the
story
he
meant
to
relate
deeply
impressed
by
the
wisdom
of
the
popular
maxim
which
says
it
is
not
always
well
to
tell
the
whole
ought
he
to
describe
the
scene
at
the
restaurant
mention
coralth
and
say
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
respecting
wilkie
after
mature
deliberation
he
decided
in
the
negative
if
he
revealed
everything
fortunat
might
become
discouraged
and
abandon
the
affair
it
would
be
better
to
let
him
discover
the
truth
himself
and
profit
by
his
anger
to
indicate
a
means
of
vengeance
it
happened
that
fortunat
had
decided
not
to
go
to
the
country
that
sunday
he
had
slept
later
than
usual
and
was
still
in
his
when
chupin
made
his
appearance
he
uttered
a
joyful
cry
on
seeing
his
emissary
feeling
assured
that
he
must
be
the
bearer
of
good
news
since
he
came
so
early
you
have
succeeded
then
he
exclaimed
yes
you
have
discovered
madame
d
argeles
s
son
i
have
ah
i
knew
that
you
were
a
clever
fellow
quick
tell
me
everything
but
no
wait
a
he
rang
the
bell
and
madame
dodelin
at
once
made
her
appearance
put
another
plate
on
the
table
said
the
agent
m
chupin
will
breakfast
with
me
and
serve
us
at
once
you
agree
don
t
you
victor
it
s
ten
o
clock
i
m
hungry
and
we
can
talk
better
over
a
bottle
of
this
was
a
great
honor
and
it
gave
chupin
a
fitting
idea
of
the
value
of
the
service
he
had
rendered
he
was
not
too
much
elated
however
though
he
felt
very
sorry
that
he
had
eaten
before
he
came
on
his
side
fortunat
by
no
means
regretted
having
conferred
this
favor
on
his
clerk
for
the
story
which
the
latter
related
caused
him
intense
delight
very
good
well
done
he
exclaimed
every
other
minute
i
could
not
have
done
better
myself
you
shall
be
abundantly
rewarded
victor
if
this
affair
is
and
at
this
thought
his
satisfaction
overflowed
in
a
complacent
monologue
why
shouldn
t
it
succeed
he
asked
himself
could
anything
be
more
simple
and
certain
i
can
make
any
demand
i
please
one
two
three
hundred
thousand
francs
ah
it
was
a
good
thing
that
the
count
de
chalusse
died
now
i
can
forgive
valorsay
let
him
keep
my
forty
thousand
francs
he
s
quite
welcome
to
them
let
him
marry
mademoiselle
marguerite
i
wish
them
a
large
and
flourishing
family
and
madame
d
argeles
too
has
my
benediction
he
was
so
confident
his
fortune
was
made
that
at
noon
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
he
hired
a
cab
and
accompanied
by
chupin
he
set
out
for
wilkie
s
abode
declaring
that
he
would
wake
that
young
gentleman
up
if
needs
be
but
at
all
events
he
must
see
him
without
delay
when
he
reached
the
rue
du
helder
he
told
chupin
to
wait
in
the
cab
and
then
entering
the
house
he
asked
monsieur
wilkie
on
the
second
floor
the
door
to
the
right
replied
the
concierge
fortunat
ascended
the
stairs
very
slowly
for
he
felt
the
necessity
of
regaining
all
his
composure
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
brought
himself
to
a
proper
frame
of
mind
that
he
rang
the
bell
a
small
servant
wilkie
s
fag
who
took
his
revenge
in
robbing
his
employer
most
outrageously
came
to
the
door
and
began
by
declaring
that
his
master
was
out
of
town
but
fortunat
understood
how
to
force
doors
open
and
his
manoeuvres
succeeded
so
well
that
he
was
finally
allowed
to
enter
a
small
while
the
servant
went
off
saying
i
will
go
and
inform
instead
of
wasting
time
in
congratulating
himself
on
this
first
achievement
the
agent
began
to
inspect
the
room
in
which
he
found
himself
as
well
as
another
apartment
the
door
of
which
stood
open
for
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
a
indicates
the
character
of
its
inmate
as
surely
as
a
shell
indicates
the
form
of
the
creature
that
inhabits
it
wilkie
was
comfortably
lodged
but
his
rooms
were
most
pretentiously
ornamented
they
were
indeed
decorated
in
more
than
doubtful
taste
there
were
very
few
books
lying
about
but
costly
spurs
rifles
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
a
fashionable
sporting
man
were
here
in
abundance
the
only
pictures
on
the
wall
were
a
few
portraits
of
celebrated
horses
which
foreshadowed
the
fact
that
wilkie
must
have
at
least
an
eighth
share
in
some
racer
after
this
inspection
fortunat
smiled
complacently
this
young
fellow
has
expensive
tastes
he
thought
it
will
be
very
easy
to
manage
however
his
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
return
of
the
servant
who
exclaimed
my
master
is
in
the
and
if
monsieur
will
enter
the
did
enter
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
wilkie
who
was
partaking
of
a
cup
of
chocolate
he
was
not
only
up
but
he
was
dressed
to
go
out
dressed
in
such
a
style
that
he
would
have
been
taken
for
a
respectable
groom
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
had
made
him
himself
again
and
he
had
regained
the
arrogance
of
manner
which
was
the
distinguishing
trait
of
his
character
and
a
sure
sign
that
he
was
in
prosperous
circumstances
as
his
unknown
visitor
entered
he
looked
up
and
bruskly
asked
what
do
you
want
i
called
on
business
ah
well
this
isn
t
a
favorable
moment
i
must
be
at
vincennes
for
the
races
i
m
interested
in
a
horse
so
you
understand
fortunat
was
secretly
amused
by
wilkie
s
nonchalance
the
young
fellow
won
t
be
in
so
much
of
a
hurry
when
he
learns
my
business
he
thought
and
he
replied
aloud
i
can
explain
what
brings
me
in
a
few
words
proceed
fortunat
began
by
closing
the
door
which
had
been
intentionally
left
open
by
the
servant
and
then
returning
to
wilkie
s
side
he
began
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
mystery
what
would
you
give
a
shrewd
man
if
he
suddenly
placed
you
in
undisputed
possession
of
an
immense
fortune
of
a
million
two
millions
perhaps
he
had
prepared
this
little
effect
most
carefully
and
he
fully
expected
to
see
wilkie
fall
on
his
knees
before
him
but
not
at
all
the
young
gentleman
s
face
never
moved
a
muscle
and
it
was
in
the
calmest
possible
tone
and
with
his
mouth
half
full
that
he
replied
i
know
the
rest
you
come
don
t
you
to
sell
me
the
secret
of
an
unclaimed
inheritance
which
belongs
to
me
very
well
you
have
come
too
if
the
ceiling
had
fallen
and
crushed
fortunat
there
and
then
he
would
mentally
at
least
have
not
been
in
a
more
pitiable
condition
he
stood
silent
motionless
utterly
confounded
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
such
an
expression
of
consternation
in
his
eyes
that
wilkie
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
still
the
agent
struggled
against
fate
and
ultimately
faltered
let
me
explain
permit
me
oh
it
would
be
useless
i
know
my
rights
i
have
already
arranged
with
a
party
to
prosecute
my
claims
the
agreement
will
be
signed
on
the
day
after
with
whom
ah
excuse
me
that
s
my
he
had
finished
his
chocolate
and
he
now
poured
out
a
glass
of
drank
it
wiped
his
mouth
and
rose
from
the
table
you
will
excuse
me
my
dear
sir
if
i
leave
you
he
remarked
as
i
said
before
i
am
going
to
vincennes
i
have
staked
a
thousand
louis
on
pompier
de
nanterre
my
horse
and
my
friends
have
ventured
ten
times
as
much
who
knows
what
may
happen
if
i
m
not
there
at
the
start
and
then
ignoring
fortunat
as
completely
as
if
he
had
not
existed
wilkie
exclaimed
toby
you
fool
where
are
you
is
my
carriage
below
quick
bring
me
my
cane
my
gloves
and
my
glasses
take
down
that
basket
of
champagne
run
and
put
on
your
new
livery
make
haste
you
little
beast
i
shall
be
too
fortunat
left
the
room
the
frightful
anger
that
had
followed
his
idiotic
stupor
sent
his
blood
rushing
madly
to
his
brain
a
purple
mist
swam
before
his
eyes
there
was
a
loud
ringing
in
his
ears
and
with
each
pulsation
of
his
heart
his
head
seemed
to
receive
a
blow
from
a
heavy
hammer
his
feelings
were
so
terrible
that
he
was
really
frightened
am
i
about
to
have
an
attack
of
apoplexy
he
wondered
and
as
every
surrounding
object
seemed
to
whirl
around
him
the
very
floor
itself
apparently
rising
and
falling
under
his
feet
he
remained
on
the
landing
waiting
for
this
horrible
vertigo
to
subside
and
doing
his
best
to
reason
with
himself
it
was
fully
five
minutes
before
he
dared
to
risk
the
descent
and
even
when
he
reached
the
street
his
features
were
so
frightfully
distorted
that
chupin
trembled
he
sprang
out
assisted
his
employer
into
the
cab
and
bade
the
driver
return
to
the
place
de
la
bourse
it
was
really
pitiful
to
see
the
despair
which
had
succeeded
fortunat
s
joyful
confidence
this
is
the
end
of
everything
he
groaned
i
m
robbed
despoiled
ruined
and
such
a
sure
thing
as
it
seemed
these
misfortunes
happen
to
no
one
but
me
some
one
in
advance
of
me
some
one
else
will
capture
the
prize
oh
if
i
knew
the
wretch
if
i
only
knew
him
one
moment
interrupted
chupin
i
think
know
the
fortunat
gave
a
violent
start
impossible
he
exclaimed
excuse
me
monsieur
it
must
be
a
vile
rascal
named
it
was
a
bellow
rather
than
a
cry
of
rage
that
escaped
fortunat
s
lips
to
a
man
of
his
experience
only
a
glimmer
of
light
was
required
to
reveal
the
whole
situation
ah
i
understand
i
see
he
exclaimed
yes

are
right
victor
it
s
he
coralth

madame
d
argeles
s
house
so
coralth
knows
her
and
knows
her
secret
it
s
he
who
has
outwitted
he
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
in
a
very
different
tone
he
said
i
shall
never
see
a
penny
of
the
count
s
millions
and
my
forty
thousand
francs
are
gone
forever
but
as

i
will

some
satisfaction

money
ah

and
valorsay

well

the
case

unfortunate

gratis

chupin
was
radiant
his
vengeance
was
assured
and
i
monsieur
said
he
will
give
you
some
information
about
this
coralth
first
of
all
the
scoundrel
s
married
and
his
wife
keeps
a
somewhere
near
the
route
d
asnieres
i
ll
find
her
for
you
see
if
i
don
the
sudden
stopping
of
the
vehicle
which
had
reached
the
place
de
la
bourse
cut
his
words
short
fortunat
ordered
him
to
pay
the
driver
while
he
himself
rushed
upstairs
eager
to
arrange
his
plan
of
campaign
to
use
his
own
expression
in
his
absence
a
commissionaire
had
brought
a
letter
for
him
which
madame
dodelin
now
produced
he
broke
the
seal
and
read
to
his
intense
surprise
monsieur
i
am
the
ward
of
the
late
count
de
chalusse
i
must
speak
to
you
will
you
grant
me
an
interview
on
wednesday
next
at
a
three
o
clock
yours
respectfully
xx
when
mademoiselle
marguerite
left
the
dead
count
s
bedside
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
to
repair
to
pascal
ferailleur
s
house
she
did
not
yet
despair
of
the
future
father
friend
rank
security
fortune
she
had
lost
all
these
in
a
single
moment
but
she
could
still
see
a
promise
of
happiness
in
the
distance
she
suffered
undoubtedly
and
yet
she
experienced
a
sort
of
bitter
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
uniting
her
life
to
the
man
who
was
as
unfortunate
as
herself
who
was
slandered
as
she
herself
had
been
slandered
branded
with
the
most
cruel
and
unjust
imputations
and
had
neither
fortune
nor
friends
others
might
scorn
them
but
what
did
they
care
for
the
world
s
disdain
so
long
as
they
had
the
approval
of
their
consciences
would
not
their
mutual
esteem
suffice
since
they
loved
each
other
it
seemed
to
marguerite
that
their
very
misfortunes
would
bind
them
more
closely
to
each
other
and
cement
the
bonds
of
their
love
more
strongly
and
if
it
were
absolutely
necessary
for
them
to
leave
france
ah
well
they
would
leave
it
to
them
fatherland
would
always
be
the
spot
where
they
lived
together
as
the
cab
approached
the
rue
d
ulm
she
pictured
pascal
s
sorrow
and
the
joy
and
surprise
he
would
feel
when
she
suddenly
appeared
before
him
and
faltered
they
accuse
you
here
i
am
i
know
that
you
are
innocent
and
i
love
you
but
the
brutal
voice
of
the
concierge
informing
her
of
pascal
s
secret
departure
in
the
most
insulting
terms
abruptly
dispelled
her
dreams
if
pascal
had
failed
her
everything
had
failed
her
if
she
had
lost
him
she
had
lost
her
all
the
world
seemed
empty
struggling
would
be
folly
happiness
was
only
an
empty
name
she
indeed
longed
for
death
madame
leon
who
had
a
set
of
formulas
adapted
to
all
circumstances
undertook
to
console
her
weep
my
dear
young
lady
weep
it
will
do
you
good
ah
this
is
certainly
a
horrible
catastrophe
you
are
young
fortunately
and
time
is
a
great
consoler
ferailleur
isn
t
the
only
man
on
earth
others
will
love
you
there
are
others
who
love
you
already
silence
interrupted
marguerite
more
revolted
than
if
she
had
heard
a
libertine
whispering
shameful
proposals
in
her
ear
silence
i
forbid
you
to
add
another
to
speak
of
another
what
sacrilege
poor
girl
she
was
one
of
those
whose
life
is
bound
up
in
one
love
alone
and
if
that
fails
them
it
is
death
the
thought
that
she
was
utterly
alone
added
to
the
horror
of
her
situation
whom
could
she
depend
upon
not
on
madame
leon
she
distrusted
her
she
had
no
confidence
whatever
in
her
should
she
ask
for
the
advice
of
either
of
her
suitors
the
marquis
de
valorsay
inspired
her
with
unconquerable
aversion
and
she
despised
the
general
de
fondege
so
her
only
friend
her
only
protector
was
a
stranger
the
old
justice
of
the
peace
who
had
taken
her
defence
by
crushing
the
slander
of
the
servants
and
whom
she
had
opened
her
heart
to
but
he
would
soon
forget
her
she
thought
and
the
future
such
as
it
was
presented
to
her
imagination
seemed
a
terrible
one
however
she
was
too
courageous
to
remain
for
long
in
despair
she
struggled
against
her
sorrow
and
the
thought
that
she
might
perhaps
reach
pascal
through
fortunat
at
last
occurred
to
her
mind
this
hope
was
her
sole
chance
of
salvation
she
clung
to
it
as
a
shipwrecked
mariner
clings
to
the
plank
which
is
his
only
hope
of
life
when
she
returned
to
the
mansion
her
mind
was
made
up
and
she
had
regained
her
usual
composure
for
ten
minutes
or
so
she
had
been
praying
by
the
count
s
bedside
when
bourigeau
the
concierge
appeared
and
handed
her
a
letter
which
had
just
been
brought
to
the
house
it
was
addressed
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
de
durtal
de
chalusse
at
the
hotel
de
chalusse
rue
de
mademoiselle
marguerite
blushed
who
was
it
that
addressed
her
by
this
name
which
she
no
longer
had
the
right
to
bear
she
studied
the
handwriting
for
a
moment
but
she
did
not
remember
ever
having
seen
it
before
at
last
however
she
opened
the
letter
and
read
my
dear
dear
dear
child
indeed
what
could
this
mean
was
there
any
one
in
the
world
sufficiently
interested
in
her
welfare
or
loving
her
enough
to
address
her
in
this
style
she
quickly
turned
the
sheet
to
see
the
signature
and
when
her
eyes
fell
on
it
she
turned
pale
ah
she
exclaimed
involuntarily
ah
ah
the
letter
was
signed
athenais
de
it
had
been
written
by
the
general
s
wife
she
resumed
her
perusal
of
it
and
this
is
what
she
read
i
this
instant
hear
of
the
cruel
loss
you
have
sustained
and
also
learn
that
for
want
of
testamentary
provisions
the
poor
count
de
chalusse
leaves
you
his
idolized
daughter
almost
without
resources
i
will
not
attempt
to
offer
you
consolation
god
alone
can
assuage
certain
sorrows
i
should
come
and
weep
with
you
if
i
were
not
kept
in
bed
by
illness
but
whatever
happens
i
shall
be
with
you
before
breakfast
it
is
at
such
a
time
as
this
my
poor
dear
afflicted
child
that
one
can
tell
one
s
true
friends
and
we
are
yours
as
i
hope
to
prove
the
general
feels
that
he
should
be
insulting
and
betraying
the
memory
of
a
man
who
was
his
dearest
friend
for
thirty
years
if
he
did
not
take
the
count
s
place
if
he
did
not
become
your
second
father
he
has
offered
you
our
modest
home
you
have
refused
why
with
the
authority
conferred
upon
me
by
my
age
and
my
position
as
the
mother
of
a
family
i
tell
you
that
you
ought
to
accept
what
other
course
can
you
possibly
think
of
where
would
you
go
my
poor
dear
child
but
we
will
discuss
this
matter
i
shall
find
a
way
to
persuade
you
to
love
us
and
to
allow
yourself
to
be
loved
in
my
heart
you
will
fill
the
place
of
the
beloved
and
lamented
daughter
i
have
lost
my
beautiful
and
gentle
bathilde
once
more
i
say
farewell
until
trusting
that
you
will
accept
the
sympathy
and
affection
of
your
best
friend
athenais
de
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
thunderstruck
for
the
writer
of
this
epistle
was
a
lady
whom
she
had
only
met
five
or
six
times
who
had
never
visited
her
and
with
whom
she
had
scarcely
exchanged
twenty
words
moreover
she
well
remembered
certain
glances
with
which
madame
de
fondege
had
on
one
occasion
tried
to
crush
her
glances
so
full
of
cruel
contempt
that
they
had
drawn
bitter
tears
of
sorrow
shame
and
anger
from
the
poor
girl
the
count
himself
had
said
to
her
at
the
time
don
t
be
so
childish
marguerite
as
to
trouble
yourself
about
this
foolish
and
impudent
and
now
this
same
woman
sent
her
a
letter
overflowing
with
sympathy
and
claimed
her
affection
and
confidence
in
the
tone
of
an
old
and
tried
friend
was
such
a
change
natural
not
being
what
is
called
a
credulous
person
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
unable
to
believe
it
she
divined
that
madame
de
fondege
must
have
had
some
hidden
motive
in
writing
such
a
letter
but
what
motive
was
it
alas
she
divined
this
also
only
too
well
the
general
suspecting
that
she
had
stolen
the
missing
money
had
imparted
his
suspicions
to
his
wife
and
she
being
as
avaricious
and
as
unscrupulous
as
himself
was
doing
her
best
to
secure
the
booty
for
her
son
such
a
calculation
is
a
common
one
nowadays
steal
yourself
fie
never
you
would
not
dare
besides
you
are
honest
but
it
is
quite
a
different
thing
to
profit
by
other
people
s
rascality
besides
there
are
no
risks
to
be
encountered
on
perusing
the
letter
a
second
time
it
seemed
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
that
she
could
hear
the
general
and
his
wife
discussing
the
means
of
obtaining
a
share
of
the
two
millions
she
could
hear
madame
de
fondege
saying
to
her
husband
you
are
a
you
frightened
the
girl
by
your
precipitancy
and
roughness
but
fortunately
i
m
here
let
me
manage
the
affair
and
i
ll
prove
that
women
are
far
more
clever
than
and
thereupon
she
had
seized
her
pen
and
commenced
this
letter
in
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
opinion
the
epistle
betrayed
the
joint
efforts
of
the
pair
she
could
have
sworn
that
the
husband
had
dictated
the
sentence
the
general
feels
that
he
should
be
insulting
and
betraying
the
memory
of
a
man
who
was
his
dearest
friend
for
thirty
years
if
he
did
not
become
your
second
on
the
other
hand
the
phrase
i
shall
find
a
way
to
persuade
you
to
love
us
and
to
allow
yourself
to
be
loved
was
unmistakably
the
wife
s
work
the
writer
s
insincerity
was
fully
revealed
by
one
passage
of
the
letter
you
will
fill
the
place
of
the
beloved
daughter
i
have
lost
wrote
madame
de
fondege
it
is
true
that
she
had
once
had
a
daughter
but
the
child
had
died
of
croup
when
only
six
months
old
and
more
than
years
previously
it
was
strange
moreover
that
this
letter
had
not
been
sent
until
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
but
on
reflection
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
able
to
explain
this
circumstance
satisfactorily
to
herself
before
taking
any
decided
step
and
madame
de
fondege
had
wished
to
consult
their
son
and
they
had
been
unable
to
see
him
until
late
in
the
evening
however
as
soon
as
the
brilliant
hussar
had
approved
the
noble
scheme
concocted
by
his
parents
a
servant
had
been
dispatched
with
the
letter
all
these
surmises
were
surely
very
plausible
but
it
was
difficult
to
reconcile
them
with
the
opinion
advanced
by
the
magistrate
that
de
fondege
must
know
what
had
become
of
the
missing
millions
mademoiselle
marguerite
did
not
think
of
this
however
she
was
losing
her
presence
of
mind
at
thought
of
the
odious
suspicions
which
rested
on
her
suspicions
which
she
had
seemed
to
read
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
approached
her
from
jodon
to
the
marquis
de
valorsay
it
is
true
that
the
magistrate
had
taken
her
defence
he
had
silenced
the
servants
but
would
that
suffice
would
she
not
remain
branded
by
an
abominable
accusation
and
even
the
consciousness
of
her
innocence
did
not
reassure
her
for
pascal
s
case
warned
her
that
innocence
is
not
a
sufficient
safeguard
against
slander
could
she
hope
to
escape
when
he
had
succumbed
she
could
tell
by
the
agony
that
was
torturing
her
own
heart
how
much
he
must
have
suffered
where
was
he
now
beyond
the
frontiers
of
france
they
had
told
her
so
but
she
did
not
could
not
believe
it
knowing
him
as
she
knew
him
it
seemed
to
her
impossible
that
he
had
accepted
his
fate
so
quickly
and
without
a
struggle
a
secret
presentiment
told
her
that
his
absence
was
only
feigned
that
he
was
only
biding
his
time
and
that
fortunat
would
not
have
far
to
go
in
search
of
him
it
was
in
de
chalusse
s
bedroom
that
she
thus
reflected
but
a
few
steps
from
the
bed
on
which
reposed
all
that
was
mortal
of
the
man
whose
weakness
had
made
her
life
one
long
martyrdom
whose
want
of
foresight
had
ruined
her
future
but
whom
she
had
not
the
heart
to
censure
she
was
standing
in
front
of
the
window
with
her
burning
forehead
resting
against
the
glass
at
that
very
moment
pascal
was
waiting
seated
on
the
curbstone
opposite
the
mansion
at
that
very
moment
he
was
watching
the
shadow
on
the
wondering
if
it
were
not
marguerite
s
if
the
night
had
been
clear
she
might
have
discerned
the
motionless
watcher
in
the
street
below
and
divined
that
it
was
pascal
but
how
could
she
suspect
his
presence
how
could
she
suspect
that
he
had
hastened
to
the
rue
de
courcelles
as
she
had
hastened
to
the
rue
d
ulm
it
was
almost
midnight
when
a
slight
noise
a
sound
of
stealthy
footsteps
made
her
turn
madame
leon
was
leaving
the
room
and
a
moment
later
marguerite
heard
the
leading
into
the
garden
open
and
shut
again
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
about
such
an
occurrence
and
yet
a
strange
misgiving
assailed
her
why
she
could
not
explain
but
many
trivial
circumstances
suddenly
invested
with
a
new
and
alarming
significance
recurred
to
her
mind
she
remembered
that
madame
leon
had
been
restless
and
nervous
all
the
evening
the
housekeeper
who
was
usually
so
inactive
who
lounged
in
her
for
hours
together
had
been
moving
uneasily
about
going
up
and
down
stairs
at
least
a
dozen
times
and
continually
glancing
at
her
watch
or
the
clock
twice
moreover
had
the
concierge
come
to
tell
her
that
some
one
wished
to
see
her
where
can
she
be
going
now
at
midnight
thought
mademoiselle
marguerite
she
who
is
usually
so
timid
at
first
the
girl
resisted
her
desire
to
solve
the
question
her
suspicions
seemed
absurd
to
her
and
besides
it
was
distasteful
to
her
to
play
the
spy
still
she
listened
waiting
to
hear
madame
leon
the
house
but
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
and
yet
the
door
did
not
open
or
close
again
either
madame
leon
had
not
left
the
house
at
all
or
else
she
was
still
outside
this
is
very
strange
thought
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
i
mistaken
i
must
convince
and
obeying
a
mysterious
influence
stronger
than
her
own
will
she
left
the
room
and
went
down
the
stairs
she
had
reached
the
hall
when
the
garden
door
suddenly
opened
and
madame
leon
came
in
the
lights
in
the
hall
were
burning
brightly
so
that
it
was
easy
to
observe
the
housekeeper
s
manner
and
countenance
she
was
panting
for
breath
like
a
person
who
had
been
running
she
was
very
pale
and
her
dress
was
disordered
her
were
untied
and
her
cap
had
slipped
from
her
head
and
was
hanging
over
her
shoulders
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
mademoiselle
marguerite
in
astonishment
where
have
you
been
on
seeing
the
girl
madame
leon
recoiled
should
she
fly
off
or
remain
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
it
was
easy
to
read
her
hesitation
in
her
eyes
she
decided
to
remain
but
it
was
with
a
constrained
smile
and
in
an
unnatural
voice
that
she
replied
why
do
you
speak
to
me
like
that
my
dear
young
lady
one
might
suppose
you
were
angry
with
me
you
must
know
very
well
that
i
ve
been
in
the
garden
at
this
hour
of
the
night
mon
dieu
yes
and
not
for
pleasure
i
assure
you
not
by
any
means
i
i
she
was
evidently
seeking
for
some
excuse
and
for
a
moment
or
two
she
stammered
forth
one
incoherent
sentence
after
another
trying
to
gain
time
and
imploring
heaven
to
grant
her
an
inspiration
well
insisted
mademoiselle
marguerite
impatiently
why
did
you
go
out
ah
i
i
thought
i
heard
mirza
barking
in
the
garden
i
thought
she
had
been
forgotten
in
all
the
confusion
and
that
the
poor
creature
had
been
shut
out
so
i
summoned
all
my
courage
and
mirza
was
an
old
spaniel
that
de
chalusse
had
been
very
fond
of
and
the
animal
s
caprices
were
respected
by
all
the
inmates
of
the
house
that
s
very
strange
remarked
mademoiselle
marguerite
for
when
you
rose
to
leave
the
room
half
an
hour
ago
mirza
was
sleeping
at
your
what
really
is
it
possible
it
s
but
the
worthy
woman
had
already
recovered
her
and
her
accustomed
loquacity
at
the
same
time
ah
my
dear
young
lady
she
said
bravely
i
m
in
such
sorrow
that
i
m
losing
my
senses
completely
still
it
was
only
from
the
kindest
of
motives
that
i
ventured
into
the
garden
and
i
had
scarcely
entered
it
before
i
saw
something
white
run
away
from
me
i
felt
sure
it
was
mirza
and
so
i
ran
after
it
but
i
could
find
nothing
i
called
mirza
mirza
and
still
nothing
i
searched
under
all
the
trees
and
yet
i
could
not
find
her
it
was
as
dark
as
pitch
and
suddenly
a
terrible
fear
seized
hold
of
me
such
a
terrible
fright
that
i
really
believe
i
called
for
help
and
i
ran
back
to
the
house
half
any
one
hearing
her
would
have
sworn
that
she
was
telling
the
truth
but
unfortunately
her
earlier
manner
had
proved
her
guilt
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
not
deceived
when
she
said
to
herself
i
am
on
the
track
of
some
abominable
however
she
had
sufficient
to
conceal
her
suspicions
and
she
pretended
to
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
explanation
which
the
had
concocted
ah
my
dear
leon
you
are
altogether
too
timid
it
s
absurd
she
said
kindly
the
housekeeper
hung
her
head
i
know
that
i
make
myself
ridiculous
she
said
humbly
but
how
can
i
help
it
when
a
person
s
frightened
she
can
t
reason
and
that
white
object
which
i
saw
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
what
could
it
have
been
and
convinced
that
her
fable
was
believed
she
grew
bolder
and
ventured
to
add
oh
my
dear
young
lady
i
shall
tremble
all
night
if
the
garden
isn
t
searched
pray
send
the
servants
out
to
look
there
are
so
many
thieves
and
rascals
in
paris
under
any
other
circumstances
mademoiselle
marguerite
would
have
refused
to
listen
to
this
ridiculous
request
but
determined
to
repay
the
hypocrite
in
her
own
coin
she
replied
very
well
it
shall
be
and
calling
casimir
and
bourigeau
the
concierge
she
ordered
them
to
take
a
lantern
and
explore
the
garden
carefully
they
obeyed
though
with
rather
bad
grace
not
being
particularly
courageous
either
of
them
and
of
course
they
found
nothing
no
matter
said
madame
leon
i
feel
safe
and
she
did
indeed
feel
more
tranquil
in
mind
i
had
a
lucky
escape
she
said
to
herself
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
discovered
the
truth
but
the
housekeeper
congratulated
herself
on
her
victory
too
soon
mademoiselle
marguerite
not
only
suspected
her
of
treason
but
she
was
endeavoring
to
procure
proofs
of
it
she
felt
certain
that
the
plausible
housekeeper
had
deceived
her
and
cruelly
wronged
her
as
well
but
what
she
could
not
understand
was
how
madame
leon
had
been
able
to
do
so
she
had
spent
a
long
time
in
fruitless
conjectures
when
suddenly
she
remembered
the
little
garden
gate
the
deceitful
creature
must
have
used
that
gate
she
thought
it
was
easy
for
her
to
verify
her
suspicion
the
little
gate
had
not
been
exactly
condemned
but
many
months
had
elapsed
since
it
had
been
used
so
it
would
be
a
very
simple
matter
to
ascertain
whether
it
had
been
recently
opened
or
not
and
i
will
know
for
certain
before
an
hour
has
passed
said
mademoiselle
marguerite
to
herself
having
come
to
this
conclusion
she
feigned
sleep
keeping
a
sharp
watch
over
madame
leon
from
between
her
eyelids
the
housekeeper
after
twisting
uneasily
in
her
at
last
became
quiet
again
and
it
was
soon
evident
that
she
was
sleeping
soundly
thereupon
mademoiselle
marguerite
rose
to
her
feet
and
stole
noiselessly
from
the
room
downstairs
into
the
garden
she
had
provided
herself
with
a
candle
and
some
matches
and
as
soon
as
she
struck
a
light
she
saw
that
her
surmises
were
correct
the
little
gate
had
just
been
opened
and
closed
again
the
cobwebs
round
about
the
bolts
were
torn
and
broken
the
rust
which
had
filled
the
keyhole
had
been
removed
and
on
the
dust
covering
the
lock
the
impress
of
a
hand
could
be
detected
and
i
have
confided
my
most
precious
secrets
to
this
wicked
woman
thought
mademoiselle
marguerite
fool
that
i
was
already
thoroughly
convinced
she
extinguished
her
candle
still
having
discovered
so
much
she
wished
to
pursue
her
investigation
to
the
end
and
so
she
opened
the
little
gate
the
ground
outside
had
been
soaked
by
the
recent
rains
and
had
not
yet
dried
and
by
the
light
of
the
neighboring
she
plainly
distinguished
a
number
of
footprints
on
the
muddy
soil
an
experienced
observer
would
have
realized
by
the
disposition
of
these
footprints
that
something
like
a
struggle
had
taken
place
here
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
not
sufficiently
expert
for
that
she
only
understood
what
a
child
would
have
understood
that
two
people
had
been
standing
here
for
some
time
poor
girl
she
had
not
seen
pascal
when
he
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
mansion
some
hours
before
and
now
no
presentiment
warned
her
that
these
footprints
were
his
in
her
opinion
the
man
who
had
been
talking
with
madame
leon
was
either
de
fondege
or
the
marquis
de
valorsay
that
is
to
say
madame
leon
was
hired
to
watch
her
and
to
render
an
account
of
all
she
said
and
did
her
first
impulse
was
to
denounce
and
dismiss
this
miserable
hypocrite
but
as
she
was
returning
to
the
house
an
idea
which
an
old
diplomatist
need
not
have
been
ashamed
of
entered
her
mind
she
said
to
herself
that
as
madame
leon
was
unmasked
she
was
no
longer
to
be
feared
so
why
should
she
be
sent
away
a
known
spy
can
undoubtedly
be
made
a
most
valuable
auxiliary
why
shouldn
t
i
make
use
of
this
wicked
woman
thought
mademoiselle
marguerite
i
can
conceal
from
her
what
i
don
t
wish
her
to
know
and
with
a
little
skill
i
can
make
her
carry
to
her
employers
such
information
as
will
serve
my
plans
by
watching
her
i
shall
soon
discover
my
enemy
and
who
knows
if
by
this
means
i
may
not
succeed
in
finding
an
explanation
of
the
fatality
that
pursues
me
when
mademoiselle
marguerite
returned
to
her
place
beside
the
count
s
bedside
she
had
calmly
and
irrevocably
made
up
her
mind
she
would
not
only
retain
madame
leon
in
her
service
but
she
would
display
even
greater
confidence
in
her
than
before
such
a
course
was
most
repugnant
to
marguerite
s
loyal
truthful
nature
but
reason
whispered
to
her
that
in
fighting
with
villains
it
is
often
necessary
to
use
their
weapons
and
she
had
her
honor
her
life
and
her
future
to
defend
a
strange
and
but
imperfectly
defined
suspicion
had
entered
her
mind
for
the
first
time
she
thought
she
could
discover
a
mysterious
connection
between
pascal
s
misfortunes
and
her
own
was
it
mere
chance
which
had
struck
them
at
the
same
time
and
in
much
the
same
manner
who
would
have
profited
by
the
abominable
crime
which
had
dishonored
her
lover
had
it
not
been
for
de
chalusse
s
death
and
her
own
firmness
evidently
the
marquis
de
valorsay
for
whom
pascal
s
flight
had
left
the
field
clear
all
these
thoughts
were
well
calculated
to
drive
away
sleep
but
the
poor
girl
was
only
twenty
and
it
was
the
second
night
she
had
watched
by
the
count
s
bedside
thus
at
last
fatigue
overcame
her
and
she
fell
asleep
in
the
morning
about
seven
o
clock
madame
leon
was
obliged
to
shake
her
to
rouse
her
from
the
kind
of
lethargy
into
which
she
had
fallen
mademoiselle
said
the
housekeeper
in
her
honeyed
voice
dear
mademoiselle
wake
up
at
once
what
is
the
matter
what
is
it
ah
how
can
i
explain
my
dear
young
lady
the
undertaker
s
men
have
come
to
make
arrangements
for
the
those
in
charge
of
the
last
rites
had
indeed
arrived
and
their
heavy
tread
could
be
heard
in
the
hall
and
in
the
courtyard
casimir
who
was
bursting
with
hurried
here
there
and
everywhere
indicating
with
an
imperious
gesture
where
he
wished
the
black
hangings
embroidered
with
silver
and
emblazoned
with
the
de
chalusse
arms
to
be
suspended
as
the
magistrate
had
given
him
he
deemed
it
proper
as
he
remarked
to
concierge
bourigeau
to
have
everything
done
in
grand
style
but
he
took
good
care
not
to
reveal
the
fact
that
he
had
exacted
a
very
handsome
commission
from
all
the
people
he
employed
the
hundred
francs
derived
from
chupin
had
only
whetted
his
appetite
for
more
at
all
events
he
had
certainly
spared
no
pains
in
view
of
having
everything
as
magnificent
as
possible
and
it
was
not
until
he
considered
the
display
thoroughly
satisfactory
that
he
went
to
warn
mademoiselle
marguerite
i
come
to
beg
mademoiselle
to
retire
to
her
own
room
he
said
retire
why
he
did
not
reply
by
words
but
pointed
to
the
bed
on
which
the
body
was
lying
and
the
poor
girl
realized
that
the
moment
of
eternal
separation
had
come
she
rose
and
dragged
herself
to
the
bedside
death
had
now
effaced
all
traces
of
the
count
s
last
agony
his
face
wore
its
accustomed
expression
again
and
it
might
have
been
fancied
that
he
was
asleep
for
a
long
time
mademoiselle
marguerite
stood
looking
at
him
as
if
to
engrave
the
features
she
would
never
behold
again
upon
her
memory
mademoiselle
insisted
casimir
mademoiselle
do
not
remain
she
heard
him
and
summoning
all
her
strength
she
leaned
over
the
bed
kissed
de
chalusse
and
went
away
but
she
was
too
late
for
in
passing
through
the
hall
she
encountered
the
undertakers
who
carried
on
their
shoulders
a
long
metallic
case
enclosed
in
two
oaken
ones
and
she
had
scarcely
reached
her
own
room
before
a
smell
of
resin
told
her
that
the
men
were
closing
the
coffin
which
contained
all
that
was
mortal
of
de
chalusse
her
father
so
none
of
those
terrible
details
which
so
increase
one
s
grief
were
spared
her
but
she
had
already
suffered
so
much
that
she
had
reached
a
state
of
gloomy
apathy
almost
insensibility
and
the
exercise
of
her
faculties
was
virtually
suspended
whiter
than
marble
she
fell
rather
than
seated
herself
on
a
chair
scarcely
perceiving
madame
leon
who
had
followed
her
the
worthy
housekeeper
was
greatly
excited
and
not
without
cause
as
there
were
no
relations
it
had
been
decided
that
de
fondege
the
count
s
oldest
friend
should
do
the
honors
of
the
mansion
to
the
persons
invited
to
attend
the
funeral
and
he
had
sworn
that
he
would
be
under
arms
at
daybreak
and
that
they
might
positively
depend
upon
him
but
the
hour
fixed
for
the
ceremony
was
approaching
several
persons
had
already
arrived
and
yet
de
fondege
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
it
is
incomprehensible
exclaimed
madame
leon
the
general
is
usually
punctuality
personified
he
must
have
met
with
some
and
in
her
anxiety
she
stationed
herself
at
the
window
whence
she
could
command
a
view
of
the
courtyard
carefully
scrutinizing
every
fresh
arrival
at
last
about
nine
o
clock
she
suddenly
exclaimed
here
he
is
do
you
hear
mademoiselle
here
s
the
general
a
moment
later
indeed
there
was
a
gentle
rap
at
the
door
and
de
fondege
entered
ah
i
m
late
he
exclaimed
but
dash
it
all
it
s
not
my
fault
and
struck
by
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
immobility
he
advanced
and
took
her
hand
and
you
my
dear
little
one
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
have
you
been
ill
you
are
frightfully
she
succeeded
in
shaking
off
the
torpor
which
was
stealing
over
her
and
replied
in
a
faint
voice
i
am
not
ill
so
much
the
better
my
dear
child
so
much
the
better
it
is
our
little
heart
that
is
suffering
is
it
not
yes
yes
i
understand
but
your
old
friends
will
console
you
you
received
my
wife
s
letter
did
you
not
ah
well
what
she
told
you
she
will
do
she
will
do
it
and
to
prove
it
in
spite
of
her
illness
she
followed
me
in
fact
she
is
here
xxi
mademoiselle
marguerite
sprang
to
her
feet
quivering
with
indignation
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
lips
trembled
as
she
threw
back
her
head
with
a
superb
gesture
of
scorn
which
loosened
her
beautiful
dark
hair
and
caused
it
to
fall
in
rippling
masses
over
her
shoulders
ah
madame
de
fondege
is
here
she
repeated
in
a
tone
of
crushing
contempt
madame
de
fondege
your
wife
here
it
seemed
to
her
an
impossibility
to
receive
the
hypocrite
who
had
written
the
letter
of
the
previous
evening
the
accomplice
of
the
scoundrels
who
took
advantage
of
her
wretchedness
and
isolation
her
heart
revolted
at
the
thought
of
meeting
this
woman
who
had
neither
conscience
nor
shame
who
could
stoop
so
low
as
to
intrigue
for
the
millions
which
she
fancied
had
been
stolen
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
about
to
forbid
her
to
enter
or
to
retire
herself
when
the
thought
of
her
determination
to
act
stealthily
restrained
her
she
instantly
realized
her
imprudence
and
mastering
herself
with
a
great
effort
she
murmured
madame
de
fondege
is
too
kind
how
can
i
ever
express
my
gratitude
madame
de
fondege
must
have
heard
this
for
at
the
same
moment
she
entered
the
room
she
was
short
and
very
stout
a
faded
blonde
with
her
complexion
spoilt
by
a
multitude
of
freckles
she
had
very
large
hands
broad
thick
feet
and
a
shrill
voice
and
the
vulgarity
of
her
appearance
was
all
the
more
noticeable
on
account
of
her
pretensions
to
elegance
for
although
her
father
had
been
a
she
boasted
of
her
exalted
birth
and
endeavored
to
impress
people
with
the
magnificence
of
her
style
of
living
though
her
fortune
was
problematical
and
her
household
conducted
in
the
most
frugal
style
her
attire
suggested
a
continual
conflict
between
elegance
and
economy
between
real
poverty
and
feigned
prodigality
she
wore
a
corsage
and
overskirt
of
black
satin
but
the
upper
part
of
the
underskirt
which
was
not
visible
was
made
of
costing
thirty
sous
a
yard
and
her
laces
were
chantilly
only
in
appearance
still
her
love
of
finery
had
never
carried
her
so
far
as
or
induced
her
to
part
with
her
honor
for
gewgaws
irregularities
which
are
so
common
nowadays
even
among
wives
and
mothers
of
families
that
people
are
no
longer
astonished
to
hear
of
them
no
madame
de
fondege
was
a
faithful
wife
in
the
strict
and
legal
sense
of
the
word
but
how
she
revenged
herself
she
was
virtuous
but
so
dangerously
virtuous
that
one
might
have
supposed
she
was
so
against
her
will
and
that
she
bitterly
regretted
it
she
ruled
her
husband
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
he
who
was
so
terrible
in
appearance
he
who
twirled
his
ferocious
mustaches
in
such
a
threatening
manner
he
who
swore
horribly
enough
to
make
an
old
hussar
blush
became
more
submissive
than
a
child
and
more
timid
than
a
lamb
when
he
was
beside
his
wife
he
trembled
when
she
turned
her
pale
blue
eyes
upon
him
in
a
certain
fashion
and
woe
to
him
if
he
ventured
to
rebel
she
suppressed
his
and
during
these
penitential
seasons
he
was
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
asking
his
friends
to
lend
him
pieces
which
he
generally
forgot
to
return
madame
de
fondege
was
as
a
rule
most
imperious
envious
and
spiteful
in
disposition
but
on
coming
to
the
hotel
de
chalusse
she
had
provided
herself
with
any
amount
of
sweetness
and
sensibility
and
when
she
entered
the
room
she
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
as
if
to
stifle
her
sobs
the
general
led
her
toward
mademoiselle
marguerite
and
in
a
tone
he
exclaimed
dear
athenais
this
is
the
daughter
of
my
best
and
oldest
friend
i
know
your
heart
i
know
that
she
will
find
in
you
a
second
mademoiselle
marguerite
stood
speechless
and
rigid
persuaded
that
madame
de
fondege
was
about
to
throw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
kiss
her
she
was
imposing
the
most
terrible
constraint
upon
herself
in
order
to
conceal
her
horror
and
aversion
but
she
was
unnecessarily
alarmed
the
hypocrisy
of
the
general
s
wife
was
superior
to
that
of
madame
leon
madame
de
fondege
contented
herself
with
pressing
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
hands
and
faltering
what
a
misfortune
so
young
so
sudden
it
is
frightful
and
as
she
received
no
reply
she
added
with
an
air
of
sorrowful
dignity
i
dare
not
ask
your
full
confidence
my
dear
unfortunate
child
confidence
can
be
born
only
of
long
acquaintance
and
mutual
esteem
but
you
will
learn
to
know
me
you
will
give
me
that
sweet
name
of
mother
when
i
shall
have
deserved
standing
at
a
little
distance
off
the
general
listened
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
a
profound
respect
for
his
wife
s
ability
now
the
ice
is
broken
he
thought
it
will
be
strange
if
athenais
doesn
t
do
whatever
she
pleases
with
that
little
his
hopes
were
so
brightly
reflected
upon
his
countenance
that
madame
leon
who
was
furtively
watching
him
became
alarmed
ah
what
do
these
people
want
she
said
to
herself
and
what
do
all
these
endearments
mean
upon
my
word
i
must
warn
my
patron
at
and
fancying
that
no
one
noticed
her
she
slipped
quietly
and
noiselessly
from
the
room
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
was
on
the
watch
determined
to
fathom
the
plotting
that
was
going
on
around
her
and
frustrate
it
she
realized
that
everything
depended
upon
her
watchfulness
and
her
ability
to
profit
even
by
the
most
futile
incidents
she
had
noticed
the
general
s
triumphant
smile
and
the
look
of
anxiety
that
had
suddenly
clouded
madame
leon
s
face
so
without
troubling
herself
about
the
proprieties
she
asked
and
madame
de
fondege
to
excuse
her
for
a
second
and
darted
alter
the
housekeeper
ah
she
did
not
need
to
go
far
leaning
over
the
banisters
she
saw
madame
leon
and
the
marquis
de
valorsay
in
earnest
conversation
in
the
hall
below
the
marquis
as
phlegmatic
and
as
haughty
as
usual
but
the
fairly
excited
marguerite
at
once
understood
that
as
madame
leon
knew
that
the
marquis
was
among
the
funeral
guests
she
had
gone
to
warn
him
of
madame
de
fondege
s
presence
this
trivial
circumstance
proved
that
de
fondege
s
interests
were
opposed
to
those
of
de
valorsay
that
they
must
therefore
hate
each
other
and
that
with
a
little
patience
and
skill
she
might
utilize
them
one
against
the
other
it
also
proved
that
madame
leon
was
the
marquis
de
valorsay
s
paid
spy
and
that
he
must
therefore
have
long
been
aware
of
pascal
s
existence
but
she
lacked
the
time
to
follow
out
this
train
of
thought
her
absence
might
awaken
the
fondeges
suspicions
and
her
success
depended
on
letting
them
suppose
that
she
was
their
dupe
she
therefore
returned
to
them
as
soon
as
possible
excusing
herself
for
her
abrupt
departure
as
well
as
she
could
but
she
was
not
accustomed
to
deceive
and
her
embarrassment
might
have
betrayed
her
had
it
not
been
for
the
general
who
fortunately
interrupted
her
by
saying
i
too
must
excuse
myself
my
dear
child
but
madame
de
fondege
will
remain
with
you
i
must
fulfil
a
sacred
duty
they
are
waiting
for
me
downstairs
and
they
are
no
doubt
becoming
impatient
it
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
was
ever
behind
the
general
was
right
in
losing
no
more
time
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
guests
had
assembled
in
the
on
the
ground
floor
and
they
were
beginning
to
think
it
very
strange
that
they
should
be
kept
waiting
in
this
style
and
yet
curiosity
somewhat
tempered
their
impatience
some
of
the
strange
circumstances
attending
the
count
s
death
had
been
noised
abroad
and
some
persons
declared
that
a
fabulous
sum
of
money
had
been
stolen
by
a
young
girl
it
is
true
they
did
not
think
this
embezzlement
a
positive
crime
it
certainly
proved
that
the
young
lady
in
question
possessed
a
strong
and
determined
character
and
many
of
the
proudest
among
the
guests
would
gladly
have
taken
the
place
of
de
valorsay
who
it
was
rumored
was
about
to
marry
the
pretty
thief
and
her
millions
the
person
who
was
most
disturbed
by
the
delay
was
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
arrayed
in
his
best
uniform
his
thin
legs
encased
in
black
silk
stockings
his
mantle
thrown
gracefully
over
his
shoulders
and
his
cocked
hat
under
his
arm
he
was
looking
anxiously
about
for
some
one
in
the
assembled
crowd
to
whom
he
could
give
the
signal
for
departure
he
was
already
talking
of
starting
off
when
de
fondege
appeared
the
friends
of
de
chalusse
who
were
to
hold
the
cords
of
the
pall
came
forward
there
was
a
moment
s
confusion
then
the
hearse
started
and
the
whole
cortege
filed
out
of
the
courtyard
deep
silence
followed
so
deep
that
the
noise
made
in
closing
the
heavy
gates
came
upon
one
with
startling
effect
ah
moaned
madame
de
fondege
it
is
marguerite
s
only
reply
was
a
despairing
gesture
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
articulate
a
syllable
her
tears
were
choking
her
what
would
she
not
have
given
to
be
alone
at
this
moment
to
have
been
able
to
abandon
herself
without
constraint
to
her
emotions
alas
prudence
condemned
her
to
play
a
part
even
now
the
thought
of
her
future
and
her
honor
lent
her
strength
to
submit
to
the
deceitful
consolations
of
a
woman
whom
she
knew
to
be
a
dangerous
enemy
and
the
general
s
wife
was
by
no
means
sparing
of
her
consolatory
phrases
in
fact
it
was
only
after
a
long
homily
on
the
uncertainty
of
life
below
that
she
ventured
to
approach
the
subject
of
her
letter
of
the
previous
evening
for
it
is
necessary
to
face
the
inevitable
she
pursued
the
troublesome
realities
of
life
have
no
respect
for
our
grief
so
it
is
with
you
my
dear
child
you
would
find
a
bitter
pleasure
in
giving
vent
to
your
sorrow
but
you
are
compelled
to
think
of
your
future
as
de
chalusse
has
no
heirs
this
house
will
be
closed
you
can
remain
here
no
i
know
it
where
will
you
go
alas
i
don
t
madame
de
fondege
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
as
if
to
wipe
a
furtive
tear
away
and
then
almost
roughly
she
exclaimed
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
my
child
listen
to
me
i
see
only
two
courses
for
you
to
adopt
either
to
ask
the
protection
of
some
respectable
family
or
to
enter
a
convent
this
is
your
only
hope
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
bowed
her
head
without
replying
to
learn
the
plans
which
the
general
s
wife
had
formed
she
must
let
her
disclose
them
however
the
girl
s
silence
seemed
to
make
madame
de
fondege
uncomfortable
and
at
last
she
resumed
is
it
possible
that
you
think
of
braving
the
perils
of
life
alone
i
can
not
believe
it
it
would
be
madness
young
beautiful
and
attractive
as
you
are
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
live
unprotected
even
if
you
had
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
lead
a
pure
and
honest
life
the
world
would
none
the
less
refuse
you
its
esteem
mere
prejudice
you
say
you
are
quite
right
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
a
young
girl
who
braves
public
opinion
is
it
was
easy
to
see
by
madame
de
fondege
s
earnestness
that
she
feared
mademoiselle
marguerite
would
avail
herself
of
this
opportunity
of
recovering
her
liberty
what
shall
i
do
then
asked
the
girl
there
is
the
but
i
love
then
ask
the
protection
of
some
respectable
the
idea
of
being
in
any
one
s
charge
is
disagreeable
to
strange
to
say
madame
de
fondege
did
not
protest
did
not
speak
of
her
own
house
she
was
too
proud
for
that
having
once
offered
hospitality
she
thought
it
would
arouse
suspicion
if
she
insisted
so
she
contented
herself
with
enumerating
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
two
propositions
remarking
from
time
to
time
come
you
must
decide
don
t
wait
until
the
last
moment
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
already
decided
but
before
announcing
her
decision
she
wished
to
confer
with
the
only
friend
she
had
in
the
world
the
old
justice
of
the
peace
on
the
previous
evening
he
had
said
to
her
farewell
until
and
knowing
that
his
work
in
the
house
had
not
been
concluded
she
was
extremely
surprised
that
he
had
not
yet
put
in
an
appearance
while
conversing
with
madame
de
fondege
she
had
dexterously
avoided
compromising
herself
in
any
way
when
suddenly
a
servant
appeared
and
announced
the
magistrate
s
arrival
he
entered
the
room
with
his
usual
benevolent
smile
upon
his
lips
but
his
searching
eyes
were
never
once
taken
off
madame
de
fondege
s
face
he
bowed
made
a
few
polite
remarks
and
then
addressing
marguerite
he
said
i
must
speak
with
you
mademoiselle
at
once
you
may
tell
madame
however
that
you
will
certainly
return
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
marguerite
followed
him
and
when
they
were
alone
in
the
count
s
study
and
the
doors
had
been
carefully
closed
the
magistrate
exclaimed
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
of
you
my
child
a
great
deal
and
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
explain
certain
things
which
worried
you
yesterday
but
first
of
all
what
has
happened
since
i
left
you
briefly
but
with
remarkable
precision
marguerite
recounted
the
various
incidents
which
had
occurred
her
useless
journey
to
the
rue
d
ulm
madame
leon
s
strange
midnight
ramble
and
conversation
with
the
marquis
de
valorsay
madame
de
fondege
s
letter
and
lastly
her
visit
and
all
that
she
had
said
the
magistrate
listened
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
ring
this
is
very
serious
very
serious
he
said
at
last
perhaps
you
are
right
perhaps
ferailleur
is
innocent
and
yet
why
should
he
abscond
why
should
he
leave
the
country
ah
monsieur
pascal
s
flight
is
only
feigned
he
is
in
paris
concealed
somewhere
i
m
sure
of
it
and
i
know
a
man
who
will
find
him
for
me
only
one
thing
puzzles
me
his
silence
to
disappear
without
a
word
without
giving
me
any
sign
of
life
the
magistrate
interrupted
her
by
a
gesture
i
see
nothing
surprising
in
that
since
your
companion
is
the
marquis
de
valorsay
s
spy
how
do
you
know
that
she
has
not
intercepted
or
destroyed
some
letter
from
pascal
mademoiselle
marguerite
turned
pale
great
heavens
how
blind
i
have
been
she
exclaimed
i
did
not
think
of
that
oh
the
wretch
if
one
could
only
question
her
and
make
her
confess
her
crime
it
is
horrible
to
think
that
if
i
wish
to
arrive
at
the
truth
i
must
remain
with
her
and
treat
her
in
the
future
just
as
i
have
treated
her
till
but
the
magistrate
was
not
the
man
to
wander
from
the
subject
he
was
investigating
let
us
return
to
madame
de
fondege
said
he
she
is
extremely
unwilling
to
see
you
go
out
into
the
world
alone
why
through
affection
no
why
then
this
is
what
we
must
ascertain
secondly
she
seems
indifferent
as
to
whether
you
accept
her
hospitality
or
enter
a
she
seems
to
prefer
that
i
should
enter
a
very
well
what
conclusion
can
we
draw
from
that
simply
that
the
fondege
family
don
t
particularly
care
about
keeping
you
with
them
or
marrying
you
to
their
son
if
they
don
t
desire
this
it
is
because
they
are
perfectly
sure
that
the
missing
money
was
not
taken
by
you
now
let
me
ask
how
can
they
be
so
certain
simply
because
they
know
where
the
missing
millions
are
and
if
they
know
ah
monsieur
it
is
because
they
ve
stolen
them
the
magistrate
was
silent
he
had
turned
the
bezel
of
his
ring
inside
a
sure
sign
of
stormy
weather
so
his
clerk
would
have
said
and
though
he
had
his
features
under
excellent
control
he
could
not
entirely
conceal
some
signs
of
a
severe
mental
conflict
he
was
undergoing
well
yes
my
child
he
said
at
last
yes
it
is
my
conviction
that
the
fondeges
possess
the
millions
you
saw
in
the
count
s
escritoire
and
which
we
have
been
unable
to
find
how
they
obtained
possession
of
the
money
i
can
t
conceive
but
they
have
it
or
else
logic
is
no
longer
he
paused
again
for
a
moment
and
then
he
resumed
more
slowly
in
acquainting
you
with
my
opinion
on
this
subject
i
have
given
you
a
young
girl
almost
a
child
a
proof
of
esteem
and
confidence
which
it
seems
to
me
few
men
are
worthy
of
for
i
may
be
deceived
and
a
magistrate
ought
not
to
accuse
a
person
unless
he
is
absolutely
certain
of
his
guilt
so
you
must
forget
what
i
have
just
told
you
mademoiselle
she
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
utter
astonishment
you
advise
me
to
forget
she
murmured
you
wish
me
to
yes
you
must
conceal
these
suspicions
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
your
heart
until
the
time
comes
when
you
have
sufficient
proof
to
convict
the
culprits
it
is
true
that
it
will
be
a
difficult
task
to
collect
such
proofs
but
it
is
not
impossible
with
the
aid
of
time
which
divulges
so
many
crimes
and
you
may
count
upon
me
i
will
give
you
the
benefit
of
all
my
influence
and
experience
it
shall
never
be
said
that
i
allowed
a
defenceless
girl
to
be
crushed
while
i
saw
any
chance
of
saving
tears
came
to
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
eyes
so
the
world
was
not
composed
entirely
of
scoundrels
ah
how
kind
you
are
monsieur
she
said
how
kind
you
are
to
be
sure
he
interrupted
in
a
benevolent
tone
but
my
child
you
must
help
yourself
remember
this
if
the
fondeges
suspect
our
suspicions
all
is
lost
repeat
this
to
yourself
at
every
moment
in
the
day
and
be
discreet
impenetrable
for
people
with
unclean
consciences
and
hands
are
always
distrustful
of
there
was
no
necessity
to
say
anything
more
on
this
point
and
so
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
he
asked
have
you
any
plan
she
felt
that
she
could
and
ought
to
confide
everything
to
this
worthy
old
man
and
so
rising
to
her
feet
with
a
look
of
energy
and
determination
on
her
face
she
replied
in
a
firm
voice
my
decision
is
taken
monsieur
subject
of
course
to
your
approval
in
the
first
place
i
shall
keep
madame
leon
with
me
in
whatever
capacity
she
likes
it
doesn
t
matter
what
through
her
i
shall
no
doubt
be
able
to
watch
the
marquis
de
valorsay
and
perhaps
eventually
discover
his
hopes
and
his
aim
in
the
second
place
i
shall
accept
the
hospitality
offered
me
by
the
general
and
his
wife
with
them
i
shall
be
in
the
very
centre
of
the
intrigue
and
in
a
position
to
collect
proofs
of
their
the
magistrate
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
delight
you
are
a
brave
girl
mademoiselle
marguerite
he
said
and
at
the
same
time
a
prudent
one
yes
that
is
the
proper
course
to
nothing
now
remained
save
to
make
arrangements
for
her
departure
she
possessed
some
very
handsome
diamonds
and
other
costly
jewels
should
she
keep
them
they
are
undoubtedly
mine
said
she
but
after
the
infamous
accusations
levelled
at
me
i
can
t
consent
to
take
them
away
with
me
they
are
worth
a
very
handsome
amount
i
shall
leave
them
with
you
monsieur
if
the
courts
restore
them
to
me
later
well
i
shall
take
them
and
not
without
pleasure
i
frankly
then
as
the
magistrate
questioned
her
anxiously
as
to
her
resources
she
replied
oh
i
m
not
without
money
de
chalusse
was
generosity
itself
and
my
tastes
are
very
simple
from
the
money
he
gave
me
for
my
clothes
i
saved
more
than
eight
thousand
francs
in
less
than
six
months
that
is
more
than
sufficient
to
maintain
me
for
a
the
magistrate
then
explained
that
when
the
court
took
possession
of
this
immense
estate
it
would
surely
allow
her
a
certain
sum
for
whether
the
count
was
her
father
or
not
he
was
at
any
rate
her
officially
appointed
guardian
and
she
would
be
considered
a
minor
and
in
support
of
his
assertion
he
quoted
article
of
the
civil
code
which
says
in
the
event
of
the
officially
appointed
guardian
dying
without
adopting
his
ward
the
said
ward
shall
be
furnished
during
her
minority
with
the
means
of
subsistence
from
the
said
guardian
s
estate
etc
an
additional
reason
why
i
should
give
up
my
jewels
said
mademoiselle
marguerite
the
only
point
that
now
remained
was
to
decide
upon
some
plan
by
which
she
could
communicate
with
her
friend
the
magistrate
without
the
knowledge
of
the
general
or
his
wife
the
magistrate
accordingly
explained
a
system
of
correspondence
which
would
defy
the
closest
surveillance
and
then
added
now
make
haste
back
to
your
visitor
who
knows
what
suspicions
your
absence
may
have
caused
her
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
had
one
more
request
to
make
she
had
often
seen
in
de
chalusse
s
possession
a
little
in
which
he
entered
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
persons
with
whom
he
had
business
transactions
fortunat
s
address
must
be
there
so
she
asked
and
obtained
permission
to
examine
this
and
to
her
great
joy
under
the
letter
f
she
found
the
entry
fortunat
isidore
no
place
de
la
ah
i
m
sure
that
i
shall
find
pascal
now
she
exclaimed
and
after
once
more
thanking
the
magistrate
she
returned
to
her
room
again
madame
de
fondege
was
awaiting
her
with
feverish
impatience
how
long
you
stayed
she
cried
i
had
so
many
explanations
to
give
how
you
are
tormented
my
poor
child
oh
shamefully
this
furnished
madame
de
fondege
with
another
excuse
for
proffering
her
advice
but
mademoiselle
marguerite
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
convinced
at
once
she
raised
a
great
many
objections
and
parleyed
for
a
long
time
before
telling
madame
de
fondege
that
she
would
be
happy
to
accept
the
hospitality
which
had
been
offered
her
and
her
consent
was
by
no
means
unconditional
she
insisted
on
paying
her
board
and
expressed
the
wish
to
retain
the
services
of
madame
leon
to
whom
she
was
so
much
attached
the
worthy
housekeeper
was
present
at
this
conference
for
an
instant
she
had
feared
that
mademoiselle
marguerite
suspected
her
manoeuvres
but
her
fears
were
now
dispelled
and
she
even
congratulated
herself
on
her
skilfulness
everything
was
arranged
and
the
agreement
had
been
sealed
with
a
kiss
when
the
general
returned
about
four
o
clock
ah
my
dear
cried
his
wife
what
happiness
we
have
a
daughter
but
even
this
intelligence
was
scarcely
sufficient
to
revive
her
husband
s
drooping
spirits
he
had
almost
fainted
when
he
heard
the
earth
falling
on
de
chalusse
s
coffin
and
this
display
of
weakness
on
the
part
of
a
man
adorned
with
such
terrible
and
ferocious
mustaches
had
excited
no
little
comment
yes
it
is
a
great
happiness
he
now
replied
but
thunder
and
lightning
i
never
doubted
the
dear
girl
s
heart
still
both
he
and
his
wife
could
scarcely
conceal
their
disappointment
when
the
magistrate
informed
them
that
their
beloved
daughter
would
not
take
her
diamonds
dash
it
growled
the
general
i
recognize
her
father
in
this
what
delicacy
almost
too
much
perhaps
however
when
the
magistrate
informed
him
that
the
court
would
undoubtedly
order
the
restitution
of
the
jewels
his
face
brightened
again
and
he
went
down
to
superintend
the
removal
of
mademoiselle
marguerite
s
trunks
which
were
being
loaded
on
one
of
the
vehicles
of
the
establishment
then
the
moment
of
departure
came
mademoiselle
marguerite
acknowledged
the
parting
remarks
of
the
servants
who
were
secretly
delighted
to
be
freed
from
her
presence
and
then
before
entering
the
carriage
she
cast
a
long
sad
look
upon
this
princely
mansion
which
she
had
once
had
the
right
to
believe
her
own
but
which
she
was
alas
now
leaving
in
all
probability
for
ever
the
conclusion
of
this
narrative
will
be
