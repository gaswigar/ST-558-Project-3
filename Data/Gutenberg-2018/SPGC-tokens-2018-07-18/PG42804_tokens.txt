the
fighting
strain
she
was
a
mixture
of
the
unmixable
not
one
expert
in
eighty
could
have
guessed
at
her
breed
or
breeds
her
coat
was
like
a
chow
s
except
that
it
was
black
and
white
and
tan
as
is
no
chow
s
between
here
and
the
chinese
wall
her
deep
chest
was
as
wide
as
a
bulldog
s
her
queer
little
eyes
slanted
like
a
collie
s
her
foreface
was
like
a
great
dane
s
with
its
barrel
muzzle
and
dewlaps
she
was
as
big
as
a
mastiff
she
was
nina
and
she
belonged
to
a
farmer
named
shawe
a
man
who
went
in
for
registered
cattle
and
as
a
side
line
for
prize
collies
to
clear
up
in
a
handful
of
words
the
mystery
of
nina
s
breeding
her
dam
was
shawe

and
registered

tricolour
collie
shawemere
queen
her
sire
was
upstreet
butcherboy
the
fiercest
and
gamest
and
strongest
and
most
murderous
ever
loosed
upon
a
doomed
opponent
shawe
had
decided
not
to
breed
shawemere
queen
that
season
shawemere
queen
had
decided
differently
wherefore
she
had
broken
from
her
enclosure
by
the
simple
method
of
gnawing
for
three
hours
at
the
rotting
wood
that
held
a
rusty
this
had
chanced
to
befall
on
a
night
when
tug
mcmanus
had
deputed
the
evening
exercising
of
upstreet
butcherboy
to
a
new
the
did
not
know
butcherboy
s
odd
trick
of
going
slack
on
the
chain
for
a
moment
and
then
flinging
himself
forward
with
all
his
surpassing
speed
and
still
more
surpassing
strength
as
a
result
the
man
came
back
to
mcmanus
s
alone
noisily
nursing
three
fingers
butcherboy
trotted
home
to
his
kennel
at
dawn
stolidly
taking
the
whaling
which
mcmanus
saw
fit
to
administer
when
shawemere
queen
s
six
pups
came
into
the
world
days
later
there
was
loud
and
lurid
blasphemy
at
her
master
s
kennels
shawe
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
with
any
degree
of
coherence
bade
his
kennelman
drown
five
of
the
pups
at
once
and
to
give
like
treatment
to
the
sixth
as
soon
as
its
mother
should
have
no
further
need
of
the
youngster
at
random
the
kennelman
scooped
up
of
the
litter
and
strolled
off
to
the
as
a
result
of
this
monopoly
the
sixth
puppy
throve
apace
when
she
was
eight
weeks
old
fate
intervened
once
more
to
save
her
from
the
shawe
s
sister
had
come
with
her
two
children
to
spend
the
summer
at
the
farm
the
children
after
a
glimpse
of
the
collie
litters
gambolling
in
the
shaded
had
clamoured
loudly
for
a
pup
of
their
own
to
play
with
shawe
knew
the
ways
of
a
child
with
a
puppy
he
was
of
no
mind
to
risk
chorea
or
rickets
or
fits
or
other
ailments
for
any
of
his
priceless
collie
babies
from
such
teddy
bear
handling
as
the
two
youngsters
would
probably
give
it
yet
the
clamour
of
the
pair
grew
the
more
plangently
insistent
then
it
was
that
the
bothered
man
bethought
him
of
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
shawemere
queen
the
nondescript
pup
he
had
planned
to
drown
within
the
next
few
days
the
problem
was
solved
once
more
peace
reigned
at
shawemere
and
the
two
children
were
deliriously
happy
in
the
possession
of
a
shaggy
and
shapeless
morsel
of
puppyhood
in
whose
veins
coursed
the
ancient
royal
blood
of
pure
colliedom
and
the
riotously
battling
strain
of
the
they
named
their
pet
nina
after
a
pomeranian
they
had
mauled
and
harassed
into
convulsions
and
they
prepared
to
give
like
treatment
to
their
present
puppy
but
a
is
ever
prone
to
be
the
roughly
affectionate
manhandling
which
had
torn
the
pom
s
nerves
and
tenuous
vitality
to
shreds
had
no
effect
at
all
upon
nina
on
the
contrary
she
waxed
fat
under
the
dual
caresses
and
yankings
of
her
new
owners
which
was
lucky
for
while
a
puppy
is
an
ideal
playmate
for
a
child
the
average
child
is
a
horrible
playmate
for
a
puppy
with
no
consciousness
of
cruelty
children
maul
or
neglect
or
otherwise
thousands
of
friendly
and
helpless
puppies
to
death
every
year
and
fond
parents
look
on
with
fatuous
smiles
at
their
playful
offsprings
barbarity
strong
and
vigorous
from
birth
nina
began
to
take
on
size
at
an
amazing
rate
before
she
was
eight
months
old
she
stood
higher
at
the
shoulder
than
any
collie
at
shawemere
she
looked
like
no
other
dog
on
earth
and
she
was
larger
by
far
than
either
of
her
parents
the
cleverest
breeder
can
not
always
breed
his
best
stock
true
to
type
and
when
it
comes
to
crossbreeding
especially
with
dogs
nothing
short
of
mother
nature
herself
can
predict
the
outcome
nina
was
a
freak
she
resembled
outwardly
neither
collie
nor
pit
withal
she
was
not
ill
to
look
on
there
was
a
compact
symmetry
and
an
impression
of
latent
power
to
her
and
the
nondescript
coat
was
thick
and
fine
in
spite
of
all
this
she
probably
would
have
met
with
a
swift
and
reasonably
merciful
death
on
the
departure
of
the
two
children
that
autumn
had
not
shawe
realised
that
the
youngsters
had
been
invited
to
the
farm
for
the
following
summer
and
that
the
presence
of
their
adored
nina
would
save
some
thoroughbred
pup
from
sacrifice
as
a
pet
so
the
crossbreed
was
permitted
to
stay
on
living
at
shawemere
on
sufferance
well
enough
fed
and
housed
in
the
stables
permitted
to
wander
pretty
much
at
will
but
unpetted
and
unnoticed
the
folk
at
the
farm
believed
in
breeding
true
to
form
a
nondescript
did
not
interest
them
and
the
loss
was
theirs
for
the
gigantic
young
mongrel
was
worth
cultivating
clever
lovable
obedient
brave
she
was
an
ideal
farm
dog
and
wistfully
she
sought
to
win
friends
from
among
these
indifferent
humans
sadly
she
missed
the
petting
and
the
mauling
of
the
children
these
mongrels
by
the
way
are
prone
to
be
cleverer
and
stronger
than
any
thoroughbred
rightly
trained
they
are
ideal
chums
and
pets
and
guards
a
truth
too
little
known
if
the
farm
people
had
troubled
to
give
nina
of
the
attention
they
lavished
on
the
kennel
dogs
they
would
have
seen
to
it
that
she
did
not
set
forth
one
icy
moonlight
night
in
late
november
on
a
restless
gallop
over
the
hills
beyond
the
farm
and
this
story
would
not
have
been
written
champion
shawemere
king
was
one
of
the
four
greatest
collies
in
america
perhaps
on
earth
he
was
such
a
dog
as
is
bred
perhaps
twice
in
a
generation
flawless
in
show
qualities
and
in
beauty
and
in
mind
he
had
annexed
the
needful
fifteen
points
for
his
championship
at
the
first
six
shows
to
which
shawe
had
taken
him
everywhere
he
had
swept
his
way
to
winners
with
ridiculous
ease
he
was
the
sensation
of
every
show
he
went
to
wisely
shawe
had
withdrawn
him
from
the
ring
while
king
was
still
in
his
glory
and
a
few
years
later
the
champion
had
been
taken
permanently
from
the
kennels
and
had
been
promoted
or
retired
to
the
rank
of
chief
as
perfect
in
the
home
as
in
the
ring
he
was
the
pride
and
ornament
of
the
big
farmhouse
on
this
particular
november
night
of
ice
and
moonlight
king
had
turned
his
back
on
the
warmth
of
the
fire
and
the
disreputable
old
fur
rug
that
was
his
and
had
stretched
himself
upon
the
veranda
mat
head
between
forepaws
his
dark
eyes
fixed
on
the
highroad
leading
from
town
shawe
had
gone
to
town
for
the
evening
he
had
forbidden
king
to
go
with
him
but
the
champion
had
preferred
waiting
on
the
cold
porch
for
a
first
glimpse
of
his
returning
master
rather
than
to
lie
in
smug
comfort
indoors
as
he
lay
there
he
lifted
his
head
suddenly
from
between
his
white
forepaws
and
sniffed
the
air
at
the
same
moment
the
patter
of
running
feet
on
the
icy
ground
caught
his
ear
scent
and
sound
came
from
the
direction
of
the
distant
stables
then
athwart
his
gaze
loomed
something
big
and
bulky
that
flashed
in
the
white
moonlight
cantering
past
him
with
an
inviting
backward
lilt
of
the
head
as
it
made
for
the
hills
at
once
on
the
invitation
king
forgot
his
accruing
years
and
his
dignity
with
a
bound
he
was
at
nina
s
side
together
the
two
raced
madly
across
the
yard
and
across
the
yellow
road
and
on
up
into
the
hills
it
was
a
wonderful
night
for
such
a
wild
run
and
were
obsessed
by
the
urge
of
it
all
forgotten
was
king
s
stolidly
loyal
intent
to
lie
on
the
chilly
mat
until
shawe
should
return
forgotten
was
the
wistful
loneliness
that
had
saddened
nina
since
the
departure
of
the
two
children
as
the
dogs
bounded
across
the
bright
road
the
kennelman
returning
from
a
stroll
caught
sight
of
them
and
recognised
them
he
shouted
to
king
to
come
to
heel
the
champion
did
not
so
much
as
look
back
at
shawe
s
call
he
would
have
obeyed
though
with
vast
reluctance
but
this
man
was
a
hireling
and
no
dog
knows
better
than
a
collie
the
wide
difference
in
the
loyal
obedience
due
to
a
master
and
the
negligible
civility
due
to
an
employee
so
king
kept
on
at
the
shoulder
of
his
galloping
new
mate
when
shawe
late
in
january
followed
the
kennelman
into
the
corner
of
a
disused
stall
and
stared
down
at
nina
his
face
was
creased
in
a
frown
of
disgust
there
deep
in
a
pile
of
bedding
lay
the
big
young
dog
she
looked
up
at
the
visitors
with
a
welcoming
glint
of
her
round
brown
eyes
and
a
thumping
wag
of
her
bushy
tail
she
was
happy
at
their
notice
she
was
inordinately
proud
of
what
they
had
come
to
see
snuggled
close
against
her
side
squirmed
seven
puppies
they
were
three
days
old
a
more
motley
collection
could
not
have
been
found
in
dogdom
two
were
and
and
were
white
except
for
a
brindle
spot
or
two
on
head
and
hip
throwbacks
these
to
their
warlike
grandsire
upstreet
butcherboy
three
more
were
intermediate
of
aspect
and
might
or
might
not
be
going
to
have
long
coats
a
sixth
was
enough
like
a
thoroughbred
collie
to
have
passed
muster
in
almost
any
newborn
collie
litter
over
this
harlequin
sextette
shawe
s
contemptuous
glance
strayed
then
his
gaze
focused
on
the
seventh
pup
and
the
frown
was
merged
into
a
look
of
blank
incredulity
the
pup
was
lying
an
inch
or
two
away
from
his
dam
and
several
inches
from
the
huddle
of
brothers
and
sisters
every
line
of
him
was
clearly
visible
and
distinct
from
the
rest
to
a
layman
he
looked
like
any
collie
to
shawe
he
did
not
any
collie
expert
will
tell
you
that
at
the
age
of
three
days
a
pup
gives
far
truer
promise
of
his
future
appearance
to
the
trained
eye
than
he
gives
at
three
months
to
the
man
who
knows
there
is
a
look
to
the
head
especially
that
foreshadows
the
lines
of
maturity
later
all
this
foreshadowing
vanishes
at
two
or
three
months
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
predict
what
the
pup
is
going
to
turn
into
but
in
that
one
brief
phase
of
babyhood
the
future
often
is
writ
clear
shawe
noticed
the
skull
the
square
muzzle
the
full
foreface
the
set
of
the
tiny
ears
the
general
conformation
unbelieving
he
stared
he
picked
up
the
wiggling
morsel
of
fur
and
flesh
and
looked
more
closely
at
those
prophetic
good
lord
he
mumbled
bewildered
why
why
that
s
a
a
dog
he
s
the
living
image
of
what
king
was
at
three
days
and
i
picked
out
king
for
a
great
collie
when
he
was
this
youngster
s
age
i
ve
never
known
it
to
fail
never
up
to
now
what
s
this
measly
mongrel
doing
with
the
head
and
build
of
a
winner
well
ruminated
the
kennelman
we
know
he
s
bred
don
t
we
king
s
his
sire
and
shawemere
queen
was
his
dam
s
mother
best
blood
anywhere
in

and
it
had
to
come

somewheres
didn

it

you
don

get
the
same
mixture
every
measureful
you
dip
out
some
is
all

and
some
is
all

and
some
ain

two
white
fellows
they
re
straight
wherever
they
got

not

of

got
to
be

up
somewheres
and
it
s
av
raged
up
in
that
little
cuss
you
re
holding
there
he
s
all
collie
just
like
the
two
whitish
ones
is
all
bull
it
s
i
ve
i
ve
heard
of
such
cases
muttered
shawe
wonderingly
as
he
laid
the
tiny
pup
back
at
the
mother
s
side
but
oh
he
ll
most
likely
develop
a
body
that
ll
give
him
away
or
else
the
head
won
t
live
up
to
its
promise
well
leave
him
anyhow
when
you
drown
the
rest
that
can
t
do
any
sheepishly
he
gave
the
order
still
more
sheepishly
as
he
left
the
stall
he
stooped
and
patted
nina
s
lovingly
upraised
head
the
first
caress
he
had
ever
wasted
on
the
lonely
thus
it
was
that
a
great
dog
was
born
and
that
his
promise
of
greatness
was
discovered
barely
in
time
to
save
him
from
death
in
earliest
babyhood
for
the
collie
or
pup
was
destined
to
greatness
both
of
body
and
of
brain
shawe
named
him
this
of
course
without
the
honorary
prefix
of
the
kennel
name
for
buff
could
never
be
registered
his
spotty
pedigree
could
never
be
certified
he
could
claim
no
line
in
the
american
kennel
club
s
studbook
he
was
without
recognised
lineage
without
the
right
to
wear
a
number
after
his
name
a
dog
to
be
registered
must
come
of
registered
parents
these
parents
in
turn
must
come
of
registered
stock
since
no
dog
ordinarily
is
eligible
to
registration
unless
both
his
sire
and
dam
have
been
registered
that
means
his
race
must
have
been
pure
and
his
blood
of
unmingled
azure
since
the
beginning
of
his
breed
s
recognition
by
the
studbooks
buff
s
sire
could
have
traced
his
genealogy
back
in
an
unbroken
line
for
centuries
king
s
nearer
ancestors
had
been
the
peerless
noblemen
of
dogdom
nina
s
sire
and
dam
though
of
widely
different
stock
were
born
to
the
purple
despite
all
this
their
descendant
was
a
mongrel
and
barred
by
kennel
law
from
any
bench
show
the
nameless
pup
grew
to
beautiful
doghood
to
all
outward
appearance
he
was
a
collie
of
the
very
highest
type
the
head
was
classic
in
its
perfection
the
body
had
the
long
lines
of
the
true
collie
the
coat
was
a
marvel
the
chest
was
deep
and
broad
the
body
powerfully
graceful
no
collie
judge
unhung
could
have
detected
the
the
mind
and
the
soul
and
the
heart
too
were
of
the
true
collie
sort
but
blended
with
the
fiery
gaiety
and
dash
of
his
predominant
breed
ran
unseen
the
steadfastness
the
calm
the
grimness
the
stark
warrior
spirit
of
the
terrier
this
same
strain
ran
equally
unseen
through
the
physique
as
well
giving
staunchness
and
iron
strength
and
endurance
to
the
graceful
frame
imparting
an
added
depth
of
chest
a
gripping
and
rending
quality
to
the
jaw
muscles
a
mystic
battling
genius
to
body
and
to
spirit
yes
old
upstreet
butcherboy
was
present
in
this
collie
grandson
of
his
so
were
a
hundred
mighty
ancestors
it
was
a
strange
blend
yet
it
was
a
blend
not
a
mixture
nature
for
once
had
been
kind
and
had
sought
to
atone
for
the
cruel
joke
she
had
played
in
the
making
of
poor
neglected
nina
the
first
half
year
or
more
of
buff
s
life
passed
pleasantly
enough
at
shawemere
at
the
age
of
three
months
he
was
moved
from
the
stables
and
put
in
one
of
the
puppy
runs
nina
was
miserable
at
her
baby
s
abduction
whenever
she
was
loose
she
would
rush
up
to
the
and
canter
whimperingly
around
their
wire
boundaries
seeking
to
attract
her
little
son
s
attention
and
always
at
first
sight
or
sound
or
scent
of
her
buff
would
leave
his
fellow
pups
and
come
hurrying
to
the
wire
to
greet
her
through
the
wide
meshes
their
noses
would
meet
in
a
sniffing
kiss
and
with
wagging
tails
they
would
stand
in
apparent
converse
for
minutes
at
a
time
it
was
a
pretty
sight
this
greeting
and
talk
between
the
young
aristocrat
and
his
mongrel
mother
but
at
shawemere
dogs
were
bred
for
points
and
for
sale
not
for
sentiment
at
first
buff
was
wretchedly
lonely
for
nina
in
the
daytime
it
was
not
so
bad
for
there
was
much
to
amuse
and
excite
him
in
the
populous
but
at
night
when
the
rest
were
asleep
he
missed
his
mother
s
warm
fur
and
her
loving
companionship
to
some
extent
this
homesickness
for
her
wore
off
but
never
entirely
always
buff
sought
means
to
get
back
to
her
and
their
frequent
meetings
on
opposite
sides
of
the
wire
meshes
kept
the
impulse
alive
in
his
heart
the
run
contained
a
litter
a
couple
of
months
older
than
little
buff
the
biggest
pup
of
the
litter
on
the
hour
of
buff
s
arrival
undertook
to
teach
the
lonesome
baby
his
place
this
he
did
by
falling
unexpectedly
upon
buff
as
the
latter
stood
disconsolately
at
the
fence
looking
for
his
absent
mother
the
bully
attacked
the
small
newcomer
with
much
bluster
and
growling
and
show
of
youthful
ferocity
it
was
buff
s
first
encounter
with
an
enemy
his
first
hint
that
the
world
was
not
made
up
wholly
of
friendliness
and
it
staggered
him
making
no
resistance
at
all
he
crouched
humbly
under
the
fierce
attack
the
bully
at
this
sign
of
humility
proceeded
to
follow
up
his
advantage
by
digging
his
milk
teeth
into
buff
s
soft
ear
the
bite
stung
and
with
the
sting
came
a
swirl
of
wholesome
indignation
into
the
exiled
baby
s
hitherto
brain
away
back
in
his
cosmos
snarled
the
spirit
of
upstreet
butcherboy
scarce
knowing
what
he
did
he
flashed
from
under
the
larger
body
and
made
a
lightning
lunge
for
the
bully
s
throat
subconscious
fighting
skill
guided
the
and
lent
zest
to
the
grappling
youngster
s
onset
as
a
result
some
five
seconds
later
the
bully
was
on
his
back
squalling
right
piteously
for
mercy
from
the
opponent
that
was
barely
his
size
and
half
his
age
by
this
time
buff
had
shifted
his
grip
from
throat
to
forelegs
and
thence
to
stomach
for
along
with
the
pit
terrier
s
instinct
for
biting
hard
and
holding
on
he
had
inherited
his
collie
forbears
knack
of
being
everywhere
at
once
in
a
fight
and
of
changing
one
hold
for
a
better
at
an
instant
s
notice
which
unusual
combination
would
have
delighted
the
soul
of
any
professional
dogfighter
yet
the
moment
the
bully
was
cowed
into
subjection
buff
let
him
up
nor
did
he
at
food
trough
or
elsewhere
seek
to
take
advantage
of
his
new
position
as
boss
of
the
run
he
did
not
care
to
harass
and
terrorize
lesser
pups
he
preferred
to
be
friends
with
all
the
world
as
he
had
been
with
his
dear
and
friendly
mother
and
so
time
wore
on
time
that
shaped
the
buff
into
a
leggy
but
handsome
pup
and
now
the
promise
of
the
baby
was
fulfilled
more
and
more
every
hour
with
puzzled
pride
shawe
used
to
stand
and
inspect
him
the
pup
was
shaping
into
a
true
winner
but
what
could
be
done
with
him
minus
pedigree
and
plus
as
he
was
if
buff
had
been
a
thoroughbred
he
would
have
been
worth
a
small
fortune
to
his
owner
but
now
again
fate
settled
the
problem
once
and
for
all
it
was
the
night
after
the
kennelman
had
put
collars
for
the
first
time
on
all
the
pups
in
buff
s
yard
these
collars
were
of
a
rudimentary
sort
and
for
use
only
long
enough
to
accustom
the
young
necks
to
such
burden
each
collar
was
a
circle
of
clothesline
with
buckle
and
tongue
attached
and
with
its
wearer
s
kennel
name
a
very
different
title
from
the
lofty
pedigree
name
scribbled
on
a
tag
attached
to
the
steel
tongue
buff
did
not
like
his
collar
at
all
it
fidgeted
him
and
made
him
nervous
the
flapped
tantalisingly
just
beneath
the
reach
of
his
jaws
which
added
to
the
annoyance
that
was
one
reason
why
buff
could
not
sleep
after
a
time
he
gave
up
the
effort
at
slumber
and
came
out
of
the
sleeping
quarters
where
his
companions
were
snoozing
in
furry
comfort
he
made
a
few
futile
attempts
to
get
the
fluttering
tag
between
his
teeth
and
to
rub
off
the
collar
against
the
wire
meshes
then
with
a
sigh
of
annoyance
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
ground
near
the
yard
s
gate
he
was
still
lying
there
when
the
kennelman
came
to
fill
the
yard
s
before
going
to
bed
as
all
the
pups
presumably
were
asleep
in
their
houses
the
man
did
not
bother
to
shut
the
wire
gate
behind
him
as
he
entered
the
yard
buff
saw
the
open
portal
beyond
somewhere
in
the
dense
darkness
were
the
stables
where
his
mother
lived
his
mother
had
always
been
able
to
solve
his
few
perplexities
and
soothe
his
hurts
in
the
days
when
he
still
had
lived
with
her
doubtless
she
could
help
him
worry
off
this
miserable
collar
and
tag
on
the
instant
the
pup
trotted
out
through
the
swinging
gate
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
the
dimly
seen
man
who
was
bending
over
the
row
of
pans
and
in
another
second
the
truant
was
in
the
road
sniffing
to
locate
the
stables
but
the
wind
set
strong
from
the
opposite
direction
that
night
it
brought
to
buff
a
faint
whiff
of
stables
it
is
true
but
they
were
the
stables
of
a
farm
a
mile
down
the
turnpike
now
though
stable
scents
had
been
buff
s
earliest
memory
yet
he
did
not
know
there
were
any
other
stables
extant
besides
those
in
which
he
had
been
born
so
locating
the
odour
he
ambled
eagerly
off
down
the
road
in
search
of
his
mother
perhaps
the
length
of
the
journey
puzzled
him
but
as
every
step
brought
the
scent
stronger
he
kept
on
at
a
bend
in
the
road
a
below
he
struck
off
into
the
fields
and
woods
taking
the
shortest
cut
to
the
source
of
the
odour
a
furlong
from
the
road
his
way
led
through
a
thick
copse
into
it
he
galloped
merrily
in
its
exact
centre
his
run
was
halted
with
much
abruptness
something
touched
him
on
the
chest
and
in
the
same
instant
tightened
painfully
about
his
neck
buff
snorted
with
scared
anger
and
lunged
forward
the
thing
about
his
neck
promptly
cut
off
his
breathing
apparatus
and
dug
deep
into
his
soft
flesh
resisting
the
panic
impulse
buff
ceased
to
plunge
and
roll
and
sought
to
find
out
what
had
caught
him
he
had
run
full
into
the
middle
of
one
of
several
nooses
cunningly
strung
through
the
copse
for
foxes
twisting
his
head
he
seized
the
noose
s
taut
end
between
his
jaws
and
fell
to
gnawing
but
he
had
his
labour
for
his
pains
the
thin
rope
was
braided
with
strands
of
copper
wire
against
just
such
a
move
on
the
part
of
some
fox
at
gray
dawn
the
hired
man
of
the
farm
toward
which
buff
had
been
faring
came
out
to
look
at
his
traps
all
the
nooses
but
one
hung
limp
in
one
writhed
and
struggled
a
very
tired
little
collie
at
sight
of
the
buff
stopped
struggling
and
wagged
his
tail
all
humans
so
far
as
he
knew
were
friendly
to
dogs
here
presumably
was
a
rescuer
and
buff
greeted
him
with
warm
cordiality
the
man
stood
gaping
at
him
for
a
space
then
a
slow
grin
began
to
crease
his
leathery
mouth
this
was
no
fox
he
had
caught
but
it
was
something
that
might
well
prove
as
valuable
he
knew
shawemere
and
had
often
seen
the
shawemere
collies
he
had
heard
that
the
shawemere
pups
brought
big
prices
here
evidently
was
one
of
those
pups
a
shawemere
collie
that
had
strayed
in
the
night
and
had
been
noosed
by
taking
the
dog
back
to
its
home
he
might
perhaps
annex
a
reward
but
scarcely
more
there
seemed
better
ways
of
capitalising
his
treasure
trove
paying
no
heed
to
buff
s
friendly
advances
the
man
left
him
there
hurried
home
received
grudging
permission
for
a
off
to
visit
the
dentist
in
town
and
presently
returned
to
the
copse
with
a
over
his
shoulder
it
was
at
the
town
and
this
would
not
be
the
first
or
the
tenth
time
a
dog
had
been
exhibited
for
sale
in
the
market
enclosure
so
a
hundred
yards
from
his
destination
the
man
lifted
the
pup
from
the
crate
and
fastened
a
rope
to
his
collar
then
he
prepared
to
lead
his
prize
across
to
the
market
but
a
dog
that
has
never
before
been
led
has
to
be
trained
to
follow
at
the
gentle
tug
of
the
leash
this
training
sometimes
takes
only
a
few
minutes
it
is
true
but
it
is
needful
now
never
before
had
buff
been
on
the
end
of
a
leash
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
had
lost
moreover
his
early
liking
for
his
captor
and
he
wanted
to
go
home
at
first
tug
of
the
rope
the
puppy
braced
all
four
feet
and
pulled
back
a
man
passing
in
a
still
more
motor
runabout
slowed
his
car
at
sight
of
the
puppy
s
resistance
and
scanned
buff
appraisingly
a
second
and
more
vehement
yank
of
the
rope
accompanied
by
a
mouthful
of
profanity
from
the
hired
man
brought
renewed
resistance
from
buff
and
brought
the
stranger
s
slowing
car
to
a
complete
stop
buff
braced
his
feet
and
sought
in
vain
to
get
some
sort
of
purchase
for
his
claws
on
the
stone
pavement
his
conductor
gave
the
rope
a
vicious
jerk
and
struck
the
puppy
over
the
side
of
the
head
this
was
the
first
blow
received
by
buff
in
all
his
short
life
he
did
not
at
all
grasp
its
meaning
but
it
hurt
like
the
mischief
and
it
set
his
delicate
ears
to
ringing
incidentally
it
brought
the
stranger
at
one
jump
out
of
his
car
and
on
to
the
narrow
pathway
you
idiot
exhorted
he
striding
up
to
the
don
t
you
know
any
better
than
to
hit
a
collie
over
the
head
it
might
don
t
you
know
no
better
n
to
butt
in
retorted
the
wrathful
hired
man
i
ll
make
this
mangy
cuss
mind
me
if
i
have
to
bust
ev
ry
bone
in
his
wuthless
carcass
by
way
of
emphasising
his
intention
he
lifted
the
amazed
buff
clean
off
the
ground
on
the
end
of
the
rope
and
drew
back
one
foot
for
a
at
the
swinging
youngster
that
had
dared
to
disobey
him
the
kick
might
well
have
smashed
every
rib
in
the
soft
young
body
besides
rupturing
its
victim
but
it
did
not
reach
its
mark
the
man
did
two
things
and
he
did
them
in
practically
the
same
gesture
with
his
left
hand
he
jerked
the
rope
from
the
calloused
hand
that
held
it
and
lowered
buff
gently
to
earth
with
his
right
he
caught
the
deftly
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
spun
him
around
and
bestowed
upon
him
two
swift
but
effective
kicks
both
kicks
smote
the
amazed
labourer
approximately
at
the
point
where
his
short
jacket
s
hem
met
the
seat
of
his
trousers
as
his
assailant
at
the
same
time
released
his
hold
of
the
his
victim
collapsed
in
a
blasphemous
heap
at
the
buff
had
been
watching
the
brief
exhibition
with
keen
interest
gradually
it
had
been
dawning
on
his
unsophisticated
mind
that
his
escort
was
trying
in
some
way
to
harm
him
and
that
the
stranger
had
not
only
averted
the
harm
but
was
punishing
the
aggressor
so
in
his
babyhood
had
nina
flown
at
a
stable
cat
which
had
scratched
buff
s
nose
once
more
the
puppy
knew
the
glad
thrill
of
having
a
protector
as
the
fallen
man
scrambled
to
his
feet
the
stranger
felt
a
cold
and
grateful
little
nose
thrust
into
his
palm
instinctively
and
with
unconscious
proprietorship
his
hand
dropped
lightly
on
the
silken
head
of
the
dog
but
he
kept
his
tired
eyes
unwaveringly
on
the
man
whom
he
had
assaulted
the
latter
was
on
his
feet
again
swearing
and
gesticulating
but
all
at
once
in
the
middle
of
a
contemplated
rush
at
his
antagonist
he
checked
himself
and
looked
worriedly
up
and
down
the
deserted
lane
in
case
of
interference
in
case
of
court
proceedings
he
might
have
trouble
in
explaining
his
possession
of
the
dog
a
dozen
persons
in
court
might
well
recognise
the
puppy
as
belonging
to
shawemere
and
there
would
be
difficulties
all
manner
of
difficulties
perhaps
a
jail
term
decidedly
it
was
a
moment
for
wile
rather
than
for
force
there
were
worse
things
than
a
kick
jail
was
one
of
them
if
you
re
so
stuck
on
the
pup
why
don
t
you
buy
him
he
whined
stead
of
pickin
on
a
poor
man
what
s
got
a
livin
to
earn
he
s
for
i
m
not
buying
livestock
began
the
stranger
then
he
paused
the
silken
head
under
his
hand
shifted
and
the
cold
little
nose
again
nuzzled
his
palm
if
you
ain
t
buyin
retorted
the
give
him
back
to
me
and
i
ll
take
him
to
where
i
c
n
git
an
offer
on
he
snatched
the
rope
before
the
man
was
aware
of
the
intention
but
buff
was
aware
of
it
well
aware
of
it
as
the
rough
fingers
grabbed
at
his
collar
the
youngster
growled
fiercely
and
launched
himself
at
the
tyrant
good
applauded
the
stranger
catching
the
angry
puppy
in
and
holding
him
under
one
arm
he
s
got
pluck
that
means
you
haven
t
had
him
long
if
you
had
you
d
have
cowed
or
killed
him
or
made
him
mean
and
savage
he
s
thoroughbred
too
what
do
you
want
for
him
if
the
price
is
fair
i
ll
buy
if
it
isn
t
i
ll
carry
him
to
the
nearest
which
is
it
to
be
out
of
a
volley
of
indignant
denial
punctuated
by
such
stock
phrases
as
i
m
an
honest
man
and
the
like
came
at
last
the
grunted
words
thutty
dollars
he
s
wuth
a
sight
more
but
he
b
longs
to
my
boy
and
we
re
movin
so
i
got
ta
sell
him
an
here
s
the
cash
interrupted
the
stranger
taking
out
some
greasy
notes
but
next
time
you
steal
a
dog
of
this
kind
just
remember
that
thirty
dollars
is
a
fool
s
offer
it
proves
the
dog
is
stolen
there
s
no
use
asking
whom
you
stole
him
from
if
there
were
i
might
be
able
to
return
him
i
had
no
idea
of
cluttering
my
life
with
anything
again
even
with
a
dog
but
if
i
don
t
you
ll
maltreat
him
and
he
s
too
good
for
that
there
are
easier
ways
you
know
of
showing
how
much
inferior
you
are
to
a
dog
than
by
kicking
the
stranger
was
doling
out
bill
after
bill
from
his
thin
roll
finishing
he
stuck
the
rest
of
his
money
back
into
his
pocket
picked
up
buff
and
started
for
his
car
midway
he
hesitated
and
looked
back
at
the
gaping
and
muttering
by
the
way
he
said
carelessly
think
twice
before
you
steal
again
not
for
the
sake
of
your
alleged
soul
but
because
it
s
liable
to
land
you
in
a
cell
nothing
is
valuable
enough
to
steal
a
cell
isn
t
a
pleasant
place
to
live
in
either
i
know
he
added
as
an
afterthought
because
i
ve
just
come
out
of
he
lifted
buff
into
the
car
cranked
the
muddy
and
battered
little
vehicle
and
climbed
aboard
then
as
the
still
gaped
at
him
with
a
new
respect
in
the
bulgingly
bloodshot
eyes
the
stranger
called
back
if
you
decide
to
tell
this
dog
s
owner
what
has
become
of
him
my
name
is
trent
michael
trent
and
i
live
at
boone
lake
about
fifty
miles
south
of
here
at
least
i
used
to
and
i
m
on
my
way
back
it
was
buff
s
first
ride
for
a
few
minutes
it
startled
him
to
see
the
countryside
running
backwards
on
either
side
of
him
and
to
feel
the
bumping
vibration
and
throb
of
the
car
under
his
feet
but
almost
at
once
he
felt
the
joy
of
the
new
sensation
as
does
the
average
dog
that
gets
a
chance
to
motor
besides
this
rescuer
of
his
was
a
most
interesting
person
a
man
whose
latent
strength
appealed
to
buff
s
canine
a
man
too
who
was
unhappy
and
with
true
collie
perception
buff
realised
and
warmed
to
the
human
s
unhappiness
added
to
all
this
trent
had
a
delightful
way
of
taking
one
hand
from
the
from
time
to
time
and
patting
or
rumpling
the
puppy
s
head
once
the
strong
slender
fingers
found
the
name
tag
buff
hey
murmured
trent
is
that
your
name
or
the
colour
of
the
goods
that
were
marked
by
this
tag
how
about
it
buff
he
accented
the
last
word
in
response
buff
s
tail
began
to
wag
and
one
forepaw
went
up
to
the
man
s
knee
buff
it
is
nodded
trent
and
a
good
little
name
at
that
a
good
little
name
for
a
good
little
dog
and
now
that
i
ve
gone
broke
in
buying
you
will
you
please
tell
me
what
i
m
going
to
do
with
you
i
m
an
outcast
you
know
buff
an
ishmaelite
and
i
m
on
my
way
back
to
my
to
live
things
down
it
ll
be
a
tough
job
buff
all
kinds
of
rotten
times
ahead
want
to
face
it
with
me
much
did
trent
talk
to
the
dog
during
that
long
and
bumpy
drive
his
voice
was
pleasant
to
his
little
chum
and
it
was
the
first
time
in
buff
s
six
months
of
life
that
a
human
had
troubled
to
waste
three
sentences
of
speech
on
him
the
attention
tickled
the
lonely
pup
his
heart
was
warming
more
and
more
to
this
new
master
of
his
closer
he
cuddled
to
the
man
s
knee
looking
up
into
the
face
with
growing
eagerness
and
interest
there
was
a
wistfulness
in
buff
s
eyes
as
he
gazed
with
tense
effort
he
was
trying
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
unknown
words
wherewith
from
time
to
time
trent
favoured
him
the
man
noted
the
pathetic
eagerness
of
look
and
his
own
desolate
heart
warmed
to
this
first
interested
listener
he
had
encountered
in
more
than
a
year
he
expanded
under
the
flattering
attention
and
his
talk
waxed
less
disjointed
yes
he
said
presently
stroking
the
puppy
s
head
as
it
rested
against
his
knee
we
ve
a
tough
row
to
hoe
you
and
i
buff
just
as
i
told
you
since
you
re
so
different
from
curs
that
you
re
willing
to
associate
with
a
perhaps
it
d
amuse
you
to
hear
how
i
came
to
be
one
eh
buff
at
each
repetition
of
his
name
buff
wagged
his
tail
in
delight
at
hearing
at
least
one
word
whose
meaning
he
knew
not
to
take
up
too
much
of
your
time
buff
proceeded
trent
trying
to
negotiate
a
rutted
bit
of
road
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
sought
to
ease
the
bumping
of
the
car
for
the
dog
here
s
the
main
idea
i
d
just
got
that
farm
of
mine
on
a
paying
basis
and
changed
it
from
a
liability
to
something
like
an
asset
when
the
came
just
because
i
chose
to
play
the
fool
it
was
down
at
the
boone
lake
store
one
night
i
had
walked
into
town
for
the
mail
it
was
being
sorted
and
on
the
mail
stage
had
come
two
biggish
boxes
of
goods
for
corney
fales
he
s
the
storekeeper
and
postmaster
there
again
at
his
name
buff
wagged
his
tail
and
thrust
his
cold
nose
into
trent
s
free
hand
the
boxes
were
left
on
the
store
porch
while
fales
sorted
the
mail
went
on
trent
it
struck
me
it
would
be
a
corking
joke
to
carry
them
out
behind
a
clump
of
lilacs
to
one
side
of
the
store
where
it
was
black
dark
that
night
i
hid
them
there
for
the
fun
of
hearing
old
fales
swear
when
he
found
them
gone
well
he
swore
good
and
plenty
and
by
the
time
he
d
sworn
himself
out
i
d
had
about
enough
of
the
joke
and
i
was
just
going
to
tell
him
about
it
and
help
him
carry
the
boxes
back
to
the
store
when
a
couple
of
chaps
that
i
d
ordered
off
my
land
the
week
before
stepped
up
and
told
him
they
d
seen
me
lug
the
boxes
away
in
the
dark
so
i
went
out
to
the
lilac
clump
to
get
the
stuff
and
carry
it
back
to
fales
and
buff
the
boxes
weren
t
there
they
d
been
stolen
in
dead
earnest
while
i
had
been
standing
in
the
store
laughing
at
fales
s
language
it
had
been
a
silly
joke
at
best
for
a
grown
man
to
play
buff
and
anyhow
nobody
but
a
born
fool
ever
plays
practical
jokes
always
remember
that
buff
but
you
know
how
a
fellow
will
limber
up
sometimes
after
a
lonely
day
s
work
and
how
he
ll
do
silly
things
well
that
s
how
it
happened
buff
of
course
i
owned
up
and
offered
to
pay
the
sixty
dollars
fales
said
the
goods
were
worth
but
he
wouldn
t
have
it
that
way
it
seemed
he
d
been
missing
things
for
quite
a
while
and
his
brain
got
full
of
the
idea
i
had
taken
them
all
and
that
i
d
pretended
it
was
a
joke
when
i
was
caught
at
last
so
he
prosecuted
and
the
county
attorney
was
looking
for
a
record
and
he
got
it
buff
he
sure
got
it
i
was
sent
up
for
eighteen
months
just
for
being
a
fool
and
perhaps
i
m
a
fool
to
go
back
now
and
pick
up
life
again
in
a
place
where
everyone
thinks
i
m
a
thief
but
that
s
what
i
m
going
to
do
buff
i
m
going
to
win
through
it
ll
take
a
heap
of
time
and
a
heap
more
nerve
to
do
it
but
well
we
re
headed
for
boone
lake
the
sooner
we
begin
the
fight
the
sooner
we
ll
win
he
paused
half
ashamed
of
his
babbling
yet
half
relieved
at
being
able
to
speak
out
at
last
to
some
listener
who
did
not
greet
the
tale
with
a
grin
of
incredulity
buff
snuggled
the
closer
to
him
and
licked
his
clenched
hand
as
the
pain
underlying
the
light
speech
struck
upon
the
collie
s
sensitive
perceptions
good
little
pal
approved
trent
touched
at
the
wordless
sympathy
and
feeling
somehow
less
desolate
and
miserable
than
he
had
felt
for
many
a
long
month
it
was
when
they
drove
through
the
edge
of
a
rambling
village
and
on
for
a
mile
or
so
to
a
lane
that
led
into
a
neglected
farm
this
is
home
buff
announced
trent
his
eyes
dwelling
with
sharp
unhappiness
upon
the
tumbledown
aspect
of
the
deserted
place
home
including
the
mortgage
that
went
on
to
it
to
pay
for
my
lawyer
did
you
notice
how
those
village
people
stared
at
us
and
how
they
nudged
each
other
well
that
s
just
the
first
dose
a
sort
of
sample
package
are
you
game
to
stand
for
the
rest
of
it
i
am
if
you
running
the
battered
car
into
a
shed
trent
lifted
buff
to
the
ground
and
set
off
towards
the
closed
and
forbidding
house
buff
capered
on
ahead
of
him
trotting
back
at
every
ten
paces
to
make
sure
his
master
was
following
trent
paused
for
a
moment
in
the
dooryard
to
grope
in
his
pocket
for
a
key
buff
had
gained
the
summit
of
the
low
veranda
as
trent
halted
the
pup
took
advantage
of
the
delay
to
rest
his
muscles
by
stretching
out
at
full
length
on
the
narrow
strip
of
porch
trent
took
a
step
forward
then
stopped
again
this
time
to
stare
in
bewildered
surprise
at
the
collie
for
he
noted
that
buff
was
lying
like
a
couchant
lion
so
far
as
his
forequarters
were
concerned
but
that
his
were
both
stretched
out
straight
behind
him
now
as
trent
s
told
him
that
is
a
position
in
which
no
collie
lies
nor
does
any
dog
lie
with
his
hind
legs
out
behind
him
unless
he
has
in
his
a
strong
admixture
of
bulldog
blood
yet
trent
s
also
told
him
that
this
was
apparently
a
collie
perfect
in
every
point
wherefore
he
stared
in
wonder
at
the
phenomenon
of
buff
s
position
then
giving
up
the
problem
he
advanced
into
the
house
buff
springing
up
at
once
followed
trent
inquisitively
through
the
doorway
as
the
key
turned
noiselessly
in
the
lock
and
the
front
door
swung
open
under
the
pressure
of
the
man
s
knee
out
gushed
the
musty
odour
that
haunts
unused
country
houses
it
filled
trent
s
nostrils
and
deepened
his
sense
of
desolation
but
mingled
with
the
smell
of
emptiness
and
disuse
another
and
more
definite
scent
assailed
trent
s
nose
it
was
the
reek
of
tobacco
of
rank
pipe
tobacco
at
that
nor
was
it
stale
at
the
whiff
of
it
trent
stiffened
like
a
pointing
dog
his
lips
had
been
parted
in
a
careless
word
to
buff
now
he
choked
back
the
unborn
syllables
treading
on
tiptoe
he
made
his
way
from
room
to
room
buff
sensing
the
other
s
efforts
at
silence
padded
quietly
at
his
heels
as
they
moved
along
trent
paused
from
time
to
time
to
sniff
the
heavy
air
presently
he
flung
open
a
door
with
no
caution
whatever
and
sprang
into
a
room
beyond
it
was
the
kitchen
he
entered
in
this
whirlwind
fashion
and
he
saw
as
his
nose
had
told
him
that
it
was
already
occupied
a
mattress
had
been
hauled
hither
from
one
of
the
bedrooms
sprawled
thereon
were
two
men
one
of
them
was
snoring
the
other
was
puffing
at
a
clay
pipe
on
the
floor
beside
them
lay
a
full
sack
piled
in
a
corner
of
the
room
was
a
heterogeneous
stack
of
household
articles
a
clock
a
silver
candlestick
three
gilt
a
plated
some
spoons
and
similar
loot
trent
had
scarce
time
to
note
these
facts
and
a
heap
of
empty
bottles
in
another
corner
before
the
smoker
had
dropped
his
pipe
with
a
grunt
and
sprung
scramblingly
to
his
feet
the
sleeping
man
roused
by
his
companion
s
noise
sat
up
and
blinked
h
m
mused
trent
as
the
two
stared
owlishly
at
him
i
see
you
boys
didn
t
reckon
on
my
time
off
for
good
behaviour
eh
thought
i
wasn
t
due
home
for
another
month
or
so
and
in
the
meantime
this
was
a
dandy
place
to
hide
in
and
to
keep
the
stuff
you
steal
clever
lads
h
m
the
two
still
blinked
dully
at
him
evidently
their
density
was
intensified
by
the
contents
of
some
of
the
empty
bottles
lying
near
the
mattress
i
m
beginning
to
understand
things
pursued
trent
evenly
you
two
testified
you
saw
me
take
away
those
boxes
from
fales
store
i
went
to
prison
on
your
testimony
you
had
lived
hereabouts
all
your
lives
and
there
was
nothing
known
against
either
of
you
so
your
word
was
good
enough
to
send
me
up
while
you
pinched
the
boxes
and
plenty
of
other
things
since
then
with
a
glance
at
the
plunder
you
seem
to
have
gone
into
the
business
pretty
extensively
and
you
picked
the
safest
place
to
keep
it
in
now
suppose
you
both
he
got
no
further
by
tacit
consent
the
two
lurched
to
their
feet
and
flung
themselves
upon
him
but
careless
as
had
been
his
pose
and
his
tone
trent
had
not
been
napping
even
as
he
spoke
he
realised
what
a
stroke
of
cleverness
it
would
be
for
the
men
to
overpower
him
and
to
claim
that
they
had
found
him
in
his
own
house
surrounded
by
these
stolen
goods
it
would
be
so
easy
a
way
to
fix
the
blame
of
such
recent
robberies
as
had
scourged
boone
lake
on
some
unknown
accomplice
of
trent
s
the
craft
that
had
once
made
them
take
advantage
of
his
joke
on
fales
would
readily
serve
them
again
but
as
they
flung
themselves
on
trent
he
was
no
longer
there
in
fact
he
was
nowhere
in
particular
also
he
was
everywhere
agile
as
a
lynx
he
was
springing
aside
from
their
clumsy
rush
then
dashing
in
and
striking
with
all
his
whalebone
strength
dodging
blocking
eluding
attacking
all
in
the
same
dazzlingly
swift
set
of
motions
it
was
a
pretty
sight
a
prolonged
carouse
on
raw
whisky
is
not
the
best
training
for
body
or
for
mind
in
an
impromptu
fight
and
the
two
trespassers
speedily
discovered
this
their
man
was
all
over
them
yet
ever
out
of
reach
too
stupidly
besotted
to
use
teamwork
they
impeded
rather
than
reinforced
each
other
up
and
down
the
broad
kitchen
raged
the
trio
then
ducking
a
wild
swing
trent
darted
in
and
uppercut
one
of
his
antagonists
the
man
s
own
momentum
in
the
swing
added
fifty
per
cent
to
the
impetus
of
trent
s
blow
trent
s
left
fist
caught
his
enemy
flush
on
the
the
man
s
knees
turned
to
tallow
he
slumped
to
the
floor
in
a
huddled
heap
not
so
much
as
waiting
to
note
the
effect
of
his
uppercut
trent
was
at
the
other
thief
rushing
him
off
his
feet
and
across
the
room
with
a
lightning
series
of
blows
that
crashed
through
the
awkward
defence
and
landed
thuddingly
on
heart
and
wind
in
another
few
seconds
the
fight
must
have
ended
and
ended
with
a
second
clean
had
not
one
of
trent
s
dancing
toes
chanced
to
light
on
a
smear
of
bacon
fat
on
the
smooth
floor
up
went
both
of
his
feet
he
struck
ground
on
the
back
of
his
head
after
the
manner
of
a
novice
skater
and
half
stunned
he
strove
to
rise
but
the
impact
had
for
the
moment
knocked
the
speed
and
the
vigour
out
of
him
before
he
could
stagger
to
his
feet
his
opponent
had
taken
dizzy
advantage
of
the
slip
snatching
up
one
of
the
big
bottles
by
the
neck
the
thief
swung
it
aloft
measuring
with
his
eye
the
distance
and
force
needful
to
a
blow
over
the
head
of
the
reeling
and
dazed
trent
then
the
blow
fell
but
it
did
not
fall
upon
trent
it
missed
him
by
an
inch
or
more
and
the
bottle
smashed
into
many
pieces
on
the
boards
this
through
no
awkwardness
of
the
assailant
but
because
a
new
warrior
had
entered
the
fray
a
flash
of
gold
and
white
spun
through
the
air
as
the
bottle
was
brandished
aloft
and
a
double
set
of
white
teeth
buried
themselves
in
the
striking
arm
buff
from
the
doorway
had
been
watching
the
battle
with
quivering
excitement
in
his
brief
life
he
had
never
before
seen
prolonged
strife
among
humans
and
he
did
not
understand
it
to
him
it
seemed
these
men
must
be
romping
as
he
and
the
other
inmates
of
the
puppy
run
had
been
wont
to
romp
and
he
watched
the
wild
performance
in
breathless
interest
but
all
at
once
his
master
was
down
and
above
him
his
foe
was
brandishing
something
thus
menacingly
had
been
raised
the
s
arm
when
buff
was
struck
surely
this
was
not
a
romp
his
master
was
threatened
and
into
the
fight
gallant
young
buff
hurled
himself
attacking
the
arm
that
menaced
the
man
he
was
learning
to
adore
just
below
the
elbow
he
found
his
grip
deep
drove
the
sharp
white
teeth
not
slashing
collie
fashion
but
with
the
grim
holding
power
that
had
won
a
score
of
battles
for
old
upstreet
butcherboy
on
the
swung
canvas
strip
a
hundred
of
his
ancestors
had
been
made
to
strengthen
the
crushingly
powerful
jaw
muscles
they
had
bequeathed
to
buff
the
pup
s
forty
pounds
of
squirming
weight
deflected
the
blow
s
aim
and
saved
trent
s
skull
from
certain
fracture
the
thief
in
pain
and
terror
tore
at
the
clinging
furry
body
in
frantic
rage
but
the
bulldog
jaws
were
locked
and
the
fearless
collie
spirit
refused
to
unlock
them
at
the
yells
and
the
hammerings
of
the
thief
all
this
for
the
merest
second
then
still
dizzy
but
himself
again
trent
was
up
and
at
his
foe
the
rest
was
conquest
hampered
by
the
ferocious
beast
that
clung
to
his
right
arm
weak
from
pain
and
exertion
the
man
was
ridiculously
easy
to
overcome
you

i
are

but
where
in
blue
blazes
did
a
thoroughbred
collie
ever
pick
up
that
bulldog
grip
chapter
two
the
hunt
is
up
michael
trent
stood
in
a
drift
that
eddied
and
surged
about
him
in
tumultuous
soft
waves
almost
threatening
to
engulf
him
the
drift
filled
the
tiny
field
in
whose
centre
trent
was
standing
its
ragged
edges
were
spilling
in
irregular
driblets
into
the
adjoining
fields
and
the
road
scattering
thence
athwart
the
nearer
countryside
to
descend
to
bare
fact
michael
trent
was
in
the
middle
of
a
milling
and
unruly
flock
of
merino
sheep
and
he
was
incidentally
in
more
or
less
of
a
fix
of
these
sheep
seventy
had
belonged
to
his
farm
for
months
and
he
had
just
added
to
them
two
additional
flocks
of
thirty
and
of
each
making
a
grand
total
of
one
hundred
and
this
morning
he
had
undertaken
to
pasture
the
three
groups
together
in
a
single
while
he
should
assort
from
the
full
flock
a
detachment
of
forty
which
he
planned
to
drive
to
boone
lake
the
following
morning
for
the
rural
metropolis
monthly
market
day
it
had
seemed
a
simple
thing
this
opening
of
the
gates
from
two
fields
and
driving
into
a
third
field
the
occupants
of
the
other
two
so
simple
had
it
appeared
that
trent
had
not
even
enlisted
the
services
of
his
beautiful
collie
buff
in
the
petty
task
buff
had
been
sent
a
earlier
to
drive
the
farm
s
little
bunch
of
cattle
to
the
forest
pasture
a
mile
to
the
east
and
he
was
not
yet
back
trent
had
not
bothered
to
wait
for
the
collie
s
return
before
herding
the
three
flocks
of
sheep
into
one
he
had
merely
opened
the
gates
leading
into
the
central
field
where
were
pastured
his
original
flock
and
had
driven
the
newer
occupants
of
those
two
fields
into
the
middle
one
then
trouble
had
set
in
as
trouble
is
forever
waiting
to
do
where
sheep
are
concerned
one
of
the
two
new
flocks
had
stampeded
at
sight
and
scent
of
the
strange
flocks
and
of
the
still
more
strange
man
the
stampeding
flock
had
ploughed
straight
into
and
through
the
thick
of
the
others
jostling
and
shoving
them
roughly
and
communicating
to
them
the
stampede
impulse
that
had
been
quite
enough
and
all
at
once
there
were
a
hundred
and
crazy
sheep
surging
around
trent
and
radiating
away
in
every
direction
their
bodies
had
found
a
weak
panel
in
the
hurdle
fence
that
bordered
the
road
down
flapped
the
hurdle
and
through
the
gap
the
nearest
sheep
began
to
dribble
the
remainder
were
in
great
and
danger
of
injury
from
the
mad
plungings
of
their
companions
another
accidental
shove
had
loosed
the
latch
on
the
centre
field
s
gate
which
trent
had
neglected
to
clamp
when
he
came
into
the
paddock
and
another
leakage
seeped
out
through
that
opening
helpless
wrathful
trent
waded
through
the
turmoil
trying
in
vain
to
restore
quiet
and
to
make
his
way
to
one
or
both
of
the
apertures
before
a
wholesale
stampede
should
empty
the
field
through
gate
or
hurdle
bruising
and
perhaps
killing
some
of
the
weaker
sheep
against
the
sides
of
the
gap
in
his
extremity
the
farmer
put
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
sent
forth
a
whistle
agonisingly
piercing
and
shrill
then
he
turned
back
to
his
futile
labours
of
calming
the
stampede
because
he
turned
back
thus
he
missed
a
sight
really
worth
seeing
over
the
brow
of
a
ridge
across
the
winding
high
road
flashed
a
tawny
and
white
shape
that
was
silhouetted
for
an
instant
on
the
pulsing
the
shape
of
a
large
collie
running
as
no
dog
but
a
collie
or
a
greyhound
can
run
close
to
earth
in
his
sweeping
stride
buff
was
coming
at
full
speed
in
response
to
the
whistle
as
he
breasted
the
the
dog
took
in
the
scene
below
him
in
a
single
glance
he
saw
the
milling
and
straggling
sheep
and
his
distracted
master
in
the
centre
of
the
panic
throng
thus
he
did
not
wait
as
usual
for
the
signals
trent
had
taught
him
in
working
sheep
instead
he
went
into
action
on
his
own
account
through
the
waves
of
a
tawny
and
head
clove
its
way
at
speed
with
seeming
aimlessness
buff
swirled
through
the
mass
sheering
now
to
right
now
to
left
now
wheeling
now
halting
with
a
menace
of
thundered
barks
yet
not
one
move
was
thrown
away
not
one
step
was
without
definite
purpose
as
by
miracle
the
charging
sheep
began
to
shape
up
in
the
field
s
centre
and
while
they
were
still
following
this
centrifugal
impulse
buff
was
gone
from
among
them
out
into
the
high
road
he
flew
not
waiting
to
find
either
of
the
openings
but
taking
the
tall
hurdles
in
his
stride
and
in
another
second
or
so
he
had
caught
up
with
the
rearmost
of
the
stragglers
had
passed
it
and
flashed
on
toward
the
more
distant
strays
before
the
sheep
in
the
paddock
had
shaken
off
their
impulse
to
crowd
to
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
the
collie
had
rounded
up
the
scampering
and
bleating
strays
and
was
driving
them
in
a
reluctant
huddle
through
the
gateway
and
in
among
their
fellows
once
more
then
without
resting
he
swung
shut
the
gate
an
easy
trick
long
since
taught
to
him
as
to
many
another
working
collie
and
was
guarding
with
his
body
the
gap
made
by
the
overset
hurdle
trent
ran
up
fixed
the
hurdle
in
place
and
then
turned
to
pet
and
praise
his
exultant
dog
buff
he
declared
taking
the
collie
s
fluffy
head
between
his
two
gnarled
hands
you
re
worth
ten
times
your
weight
in
hired
men
and
you
re
the
best
and
chum
a
lonely
chap
ever
had
buff
grinned
licked
his
master
s
hand
in
quick
friendliness
then
lay
down
at
trent
s
feet
for
an
instant
s
rest
and
for
the
thousandth
time
in
the
past
three
years
the
man
noted
something
in
the
collie
s
pose
that
baffled
him
for
though
buff
was
lying
upright
and
not
on
his
side
both
hind
legs
were
stretched
straight
out
behind
him
normally
no
collie
lies
thus
nor
does
any
other
canine
that
is
not
the
possessor
of
a
strong
strain
of
bulldog
it
was
buff
s
favourite
posture
and
buff
had
every
point
of
a
collie
indeed
of
the
highest
type
of
show
the
man
s
bewilderment
was
roused
thus
from
time
to
time
by
the
dog
s
various
bulldog
traits
such
as
lying
with
hindlegs
out
behind
him
or
of
holding
a
grip
with
the
grim
stubbornness
of
a
pit
terrier
rather
than
with
the
fiery
dash
of
a
true
collie
or
of
diving
for
the
heels
of
driven
cattle
instead
of
for
nose
and
ear
waiting
only
for
a
moment
while
buff
was
breathing
himself
after
his
hard
run
across
country
and
his
harder
rounding
up
of
the
flock
trent
chirped
to
the
collie
and
prepared
to
shut
the
two
new
consignments
of
merinos
back
in
their
respective
pens
the
mingling
of
the
three
flocks
had
been
a
mistake
until
their
forthcoming
drive
to
market
the
three
bunches
would
fare
better
among
their
own
acquaintances
than
among
strange
sheep
but
the
task
was
no
easy
one
to
a
casual
eye
all
the
milling
sheep
looked
just
alike
trent
could
distinguish
by
his
personal
red
mark
his
original
flock
but
the
two
sets
of
strangers
were
unmarked
wherefore
his
chirp
to
buff
the
moment
the
collie
was
made
to
see
what
was
required
of
him
he
was
in
the
thick
of
the
jostling
turmoil
again
flashing
in
and
out
like
a
streak
of
tawny
fire
seeming
to
have
no
objective
but
to
be
scampering
without
any
special
purpose
yet
within
fifty
seconds
he
had
headed
a
scared
sheep
through
the
gateway
into
the
paddock
where
stood
his
master
then
another
and
yet
another
sheep
then
a
huddled
of
them
cantered
bleatingly
into
the
paddock
while
trent
looked
on
in
wonder
buff
proceeded
to
segregate
until
the
entire
that
belonged
in
this
particular
field
were
back
within
its
boundaries
trent
shifted
to
the
opposite
paddock
whence
he
had
turned
the
second
flock
of
thirty
into
the
central
enclosure
and
here
buff
repeated
his
unerring
performance
though
trent
was
filled
with
amazed
admiration
at
his
pet
s
discernment
yet
he
recognised
there
was
nothing
miraculous
in
it
buff
had
herded
both
these
new
flocks
into
the
paddocks
at
least
three
times
before
on
their
way
from
pasture
during
the
few
days
trent
had
owned
them
he
had
become
familiar
with
their
scents
and
their
separate
identities
after
the
uncanny
fashion
of
the
best
sort
of
working
collie
as
the
job
ended
and
trent
started
homeward
with
buff
trotting
chummily
beside
him
a
slender
black
came
around
the
bend
of
the
road
between
the
paddocks
and
the
farmhouse
astride
the
black
sat
a
figure
as
slender
and
highbred
as
the
mount
s
own
the
rider
was
a
girl
of
perhaps
twenty
clad
in
crash
and
booted
at
sight
of
the
man
and
the
collie
she
waved
her
crop
gaily
at
them
and
put
her
horse
to
a
lope
by
a
shift
of
the
trent
s
bronzed
face
went
red
with
surprised
pleasure
at
the
equestrian
vision
bearing
down
on
him
buff
after
a
single
doubtful
glance
recognised
horse
and
rider
and
set
off
at
a
run
to
welcome
them
why
i
didn
t
know
you
were
at
home
yet
ruth
exclaimed
trent
reaching
up
to
take
the
gauntleted
little
hand
extended
to
greet
him
your
father
said
you
d
be
in
the
city
another
month
i
saw
him
at
the
store
last
evening
and
he
said
yes
she
interrupted
i
know
he
hadn
t
got
my
telegram
then
aunt
hester
had
to
go
out
west
to
take
care
of
her
son
my
cousin
dick
clinton
you
remember
he
has
a
ranch
in
idaho
she
had
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
morning
saying
he
d
broken
his
leg
so
she
packed
up
right
away
and
took
the
night
train
west
and
i
came
oh
said
trent
in
an
effort
at
sympathy
and
you
had
to
cut
your
visit
in
half
what
a
shame
no
she
denied
guiltily
it
wasn
t
a
shame
it
was
a
blessing
i
oughtn
t
to
say
so
but
it
was
she
did
everything
to
give
me
a
good
time
and
i
enjoyed
it
too
ever
so
much
but
all
the
while
i
was
homesick
for
these
dear
hills
and
i
m
so
glad
to
get
back
to
them
it
s
queer
she
added
how
i
ve
grown
to
love
this
boone
lake
region
when
dad
and
i
have
lived
here
barely
eighteen
eighteen
months
and
nine
days
gravely
corrected
trent
i
remember
i
had
gone
to
town
that
evening
to
get
the
mail
and
when
i
passed
by
the
old
brander
house
i
saw
lights
in
it
at
the
they
told
me
a
new
york
man
and
his
daughter
some
people
named
hammerton
had
moved
in
that
day
and
that
they
d
come
here
for
hammerton
s
health
it
wasn
t
more
than
a
week
just
six
days
to
be
exact
after
that
when
your
father
stopped
here
to
ask
me
about
the
commission
people
i
was
dealing
with
in
the
city
he
spent
the
morning
and
he
asked
me
to
come
and
see
him
it
was
the
next
evening
i
called
that
was
when
i
met
you
so
do
you
keep
a
diary
she
asked
in
an
amusement
that
seemed
tinged
with
embarrassment
or
have
you
a
genius
for
remembering
dates
and
pursued
trent
it
was
just
sixteen
days
after
that
when
we
went
horseback
riding
the
first
time
it
it
may
be
a
bit
of
silly
superstition
he
went
on
reluctantly
but
i
ve
always
dated
the
start
of
this
farm
toward
real
success
from
the
time
you
people
moved
to
boone
lake
ever
since
then
i
ve
prospered
another
six
months
will
find
me
in
shape
to
install
the
last
lot
of
machinery
and
to
take
over
that
tract
of
holden
s
that
i
ve
got
the
option
on
then
i
can
begin
to
call
my
soul
my
own
and
live
like
real
people
and
the
first
day
i
can
do
that
i
am
going
to
put
my
whole
fortune
and
my
life
too
to
the
biggest
test
in
the
world
a
test
i
hadn
t
any
right
to
put
it
to
while
i
was
staggering
along
on
the
edge
of
bankruptcy
and
with
the
future
all
so
hazy
in
six
months
i
ll
be
able
to
ask
a
question
that
will
show
me
whether
all
my
luck
is
dead
sea
fruit
or
or
the
greatest
thing
that
ever
he
talked
on
ramblingly
with
an
effort
at
unconcern
avoiding
her
eyes
but
his
gaze
was
on
her
little
gloved
hand
as
it
lay
athwart
the
horse
s
mane
and
he
saw
it
tremble
and
clench
trent
was
half
glad
half
frightened
that
she
had
caught
the
drift
of
his
blundering
words
before
he
could
continue
buff
created
a
diversion
by
routing
a
large
and
terrified
rabbit
out
of
a
fence
corner
and
charging
down
the
road
toward
them
in
noisy
pursuit
of
his
prey
bunny
fled
in
blind
panic
straight
between
the
nervous
horse
s
forefeet
the
mount
snorted
and
reared
as
ruth
skilfully
mastered
the
plunging
steed
trent
caught
the
bridle
close
to
the
bit
and
at
the
same
time
whistled
buff
to
heel
unwillingly
but
instantly
the
collie
abandoned
his
delightful
chase
and
trotted
obediently
back
to
his
master
don
t
scold
him
begged
ruth
it
wasn
t
his
fault
i
m
not
going
to
scold
him
laughed
trent
ruffling
the
dog
s
ears
it
s
many
a
long
month
since
buff
needed
a
scolding
he
didn
t
drive
the
rabbit
this
way
the
rabbit
drove
itself
before
buff
could
choose
the
direction
he
buff
is
splendid
protection
for
you
isn
t
he
she
broke
in
a
tinge
of
nervousness
in
her
soft
voice
why
personally
i
don
t
stand
in
any
great
need
of
protection
he
smiled
i
m
not
exactly
a
timid
little
flower
but
he
protects
the
farm
and
the
house
and
the
livestock
as
efficiently
as
a
company
could
he
s
a
born
buff
realising
he
was
under
discussion
sat
down
in
the
road
between
the
man
and
the
girl
he
was
wriggling
with
and
fanning
the
dust
into
a
little
whirlwind
with
the
lightning
sweeps
of
his
plumy
tail
as
he
grinned
expectantly
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
speakers
but
the
collie
s
grin
found
no
answer
on
ruth
hammerton
s
face
the
girl
s
eyes
had
grown
grave
and
there
was
a
tinge
of
uneasiness
in
them
i
hope
you
re
right
she
began
hesitantly
in
saying
you
don
t
need
any
protection
and
probably
i
m
foolish
but
that
s
why
i
rode
out
here
this
to
protect
me
he
asked
quizzically
yet
perplexed
at
her
new
bearing
to
risk
your
thinking
me
impertinent
she
evaded
by
mixing
into
something
that
doesn
t
concern
anything
that
concerns
me
he
said
as
she
hesitated
again
concerns
you
too
so
far
as
you
ll
let
it
what
s
the
matter
she
drew
a
long
breath
knit
her
dark
brows
and
plunged
into
the
distasteful
mission
that
had
brought
her
to
the
trent
farm
in
the
first
place
she
began
do
you
know
two
men
named
con
hegan
and
billy
gates
in
stark
surprise
trent
stared
up
at
her
why
yes
he
made
answer
of
course
i
do
i
have
good
reason
to
know
them
i
ve
told
you
the
story
i
told
it
to
your
father
too
before
i
accepted
his
invitation
to
come
and
see
him
they
were
the
two
men
i
found
in
my
kitchen
when
i
yes
yes
she
interposed
hastily
as
though
trying
to
shield
him
from
memories
that
must
be
painful
i
know
of
course
i
remember
but
but
you
never
told
me
their
names
i
m
certain
you
didn
t
or
they
d
have
been
familiar
to
me
when
i
heard
them
this
this
morning
echoed
trent
puzzled
i
don
t
i
was
at
the
store
doing
the
marketing
she
explained
some
men
were
loafing
on
the
steps
just
outside
the
window
and
one
of
them
said
a
fellow
from
down
told
me
just
now
that
con
hegan
and
billy
gates
are
due
to
be
turned
loose
and
one
of
the
other
men
said
then
trent
had
better
hire
a
special
cop
and
take
out
another
life
insurance
policy
both
of
em
swore
they
d
get
him
if
they
was
to
go
to
the
chair
for
it
and
that
s
one
kind
of
an
oath
neither
of
em
s
liable
to
break
i
wouldn
t
like
to
be
in
his
shoes
just
now
that
was
all
i
could
hear
but
it
worried
me
i
didn
t
associate
the
names
with
those
men
you
had
told
me
about
perhaps
because
the
phrase
turned
loose
didn
t
mean
anything
to
me
but
i
came
out
here
to
tell
you
just
the
same
it
wasn
t
so
much
what
the
fellow
on
the
store
steps
said
as
the
scared
way
he
said
it
that
frightened
me
oh
is
there
any
real
danger
of
nonsense
laughed
trent
there
s
no
danger
at
all
and
you
re
not
to
give
the
matter
another
minute
of
your
precious
thought
but
it
was
bully
of
you
to
come
out
here
to
warn
me
to
care
enough
to
you
re
making
light
of
it
just
to
make
me
stop
worrying
she
accused
i
know
you
are
won
t
you
please
notify
the
police
about
their
threat
won
t
you
go
armed
won
t
you
lock
your
house
ever
so
carefully
and
keep
indoors
after
dark
and
and
wear
warm
flannels
next
to
my
skin
all
summer
supplemented
trent
with
vast
solemnity
and
carry
an
umbrella
and
wear
rubbers
if
the
day
is
at
all
stormy
and
stop
she
commanded
a
hint
of
tears
in
her
troubled
young
voice
you
re
making
fun
of
me
heaven
forbid
he
disclaimed
piously
you
are
she
accused
and
you
re
doing
it
to
lead
me
to
think
you
aren
t
in
any
danger
so
that
i
won
t
worry
but
there
danger
and
i
know
it
i
m
positive
of
it
now
that
you
ve
told
me
who
those
men
really
are
oh
can
t
you
listen
he
begged
you
re
getting
all
wrought
up
over
nothing
ruth
it
s
wonderful
to
have
you
bother
your
head
over
my
safety
but
i
m
not
going
to
let
you
do
it
here
s
the
idea
hegan
and
gates
belonged
to
the
riverside
gang
over
in
south
boone
the
gang
was
cleared
out
some
years
ago
some
of
its
members
went
to
jail
the
police
had
nothing
definite
on
those
two
so
they
let
them
alone
they
picked
up
a
living
by
their
wits
as
tramps
and
they
kept
their
petty
thefts
from
being
found
out
then
when
they
d
sent
me
to
prison
they
d
had
it
in
for
me
ever
since
the
time
i
caught
them
near
my
and
ordered
them
off
my
land
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
stray
kick
or
so
they
went
into
the
business
on
a
larger
scale
using
my
house
as
a
place
to
store
their
plunder
and
to
hide
out
in
when
the
neighbours
might
be
suspecting
them
of
a
share
in
the
robberies
when
buff
and
i
collared
them
they
went
all
to
pieces
and
confessed
everything
just
as
i
told
you
before
now
i
leave
it
to
you
if
two
such
pitifully
cowardly
sneak
thieves
are
likely
to
risk
another
jail
sentence
by
trying
to
harm
me
it
s
ridiculous
just
the
same
i
m
as
much
your
debtor
for
warning
me
as
if
the
danger
were
ruth
had
dismounted
during
the
talk
now
turning
to
the
horse
she
prepared
to
get
into
the
saddle
once
more
but
first
she
bent
down
and
laid
her
soft
cheek
against
the
delighted
buff
s
head
under
cover
of
the
collie
s
glad
whimper
of
friendliness
she
whispered
very
low
take
care
of
him
buff
oh
take
care
of
him
for
then
with
assumed
lightness
she
said
as
trent
lifted
her
to
the
saddle
probably
you
re
right
but
it
didn
t
do
any
harm
to
warn
you
i
m
sorry
if
i
ve
seemed
foolish
the
little
black
horse
cantered
away
michael
trent
and
buff
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
watching
the
girl
out
of
sight
then
trent
turned
slowly
to
his
chum
buff
old
man
said
he
we
made
a
good
bluff
of
it
just
now
you
and
i
all
the
same
it
s
up
to
us
both
to
keep
our
eyes
open
for
a
while
hegan
and
gates
were
soaked
with
cheap
whisky
and
sodden
and
jumpy
after
a
week
s
carouse
when
the
chief
of
police
sweated
them
and
he
sure
did
sweat
them
good
and
hard
it
smashed
their
nerve
because
they
were
in
prime
shape
to
have
it
smashed
and
that
s
how
he
got
them
to
go
all
to
pieces
and
confess
that
and
the
goods
he
found
on
them
and
besides
he
told
each
of
them
separately
that
the
other
one
had
squealed
and
made
them
sore
on
each
other
that
way
but
that
wasn
t
like
either
gates
or
hegan
to
give
in
when
they
were
normal
they
were
as
tough
a
pair
of
birds
as
i
care
to
see
they
ve
had
nearly
three
years
to
sober
up
in
and
get
back
their
nerve
by
hard
work
and
plain
food
and
no
drink
buff
and
unless
i
ve
got
them
both
sized
up
all
wrong
they
ve
been
spending
most
of
that
three
years
in
planning
how
to
get
back
at
the
man
who
spoiled
their
game
and
thrashed
them
and
got
them
put
away
they
ve
had
plenty
of
time
to
store
up
venom
buff
and
plenty
of
venom
to
store
up
yes
and
a
good
alibi
too
to
clear
them
if
anything
happens
to
me
buff
we
aren
t
going
to
be
fools
enough
to
worry
but
we
ll
keep
awake
just
the
same
and
lord
but
wasn
t
it
glorious
of
her
to
care
enough
about
me
to
come
way
out
here
and
warn
me
buff
she
knew
what
i
meant
too
when
i
told
her
about
having
the
right
pretty
soon
to
ask
a
i
wonder
if
i
m
not
to
have
asked
it
long
ago
instead
of
waiting
till
i
had
something
besides
my
measly
self
to
offer
during
his
mumbled
address
to
the
wistfully
listening
dog
he
had
been
moving
homeward
now
standing
on
his
neat
porch
the
man
looked
about
him
over
his
farm
and
its
trim
buildings
with
a
little
throb
of
pride
as
he
contrasted
it
with
the
way
the
home
had
looked
on
his
return
from
prison
three
years
earlier
the
world
all
at
once
seemed
to
him
a
wonderful
place
to
live
in
and
life
seemed
unbelievably
sweet
his
glance
strayed
down
the
long
yellow
road
toward
the
old
brander
place
and
his
lean
face
softened
with
a
glow
that
transfigured
it
early
the
following
morning
michael
trent
set
off
down
the
same
yellow
road
toward
boone
lake
for
the
monthly
market
day
but
the
patch
of
road
directly
in
front
of
him
was
no
longer
yellow
it
was
filled
with
jogging
and
tossing
billows
of
forty
sheep
consigned
to
the
market
were
moving
in
close
formation
in
front
of
their
master
for
one
reason
alone
did
they
keep
this
close
formation
or
indeed
keep
to
the
narrow
road
at
all
that
one
reason
was
buff
the
collie
with
calm
generalship
was
herding
and
driving
them
and
he
was
doing
it
to
such
perfection
as
to
make
trent
s
rearguard
task
a
sinecure
for
more
than
thirty
months
now
buff
had
been
the
lonely
trent
s
closest
chum
and
almost
his
only
companion
with
true
collie
efficiency
the
dog
had
learned
his
hard
and
confusing
farm
lessons
from
the
master
who
never
lost
his
temper
with
him
and
who
never
dealt
unjustly
by
him
the
bond
between
the
two
had
sharpened
and
increased
buff
s
naturally
human
tendencies
and
had
brought
out
in
him
the
great
soul
and
uncanny
brain
wherewith
nature
had
endowed
him
a
dog
he
idolised
trent
and
served
him
with
joyous
zeal
trent
and
buff
guided
their
woolly
charges
through
the
single
winding
street
of
boone
lake
now
beginning
to
fill
with
market
day
traffic
and
on
to
the
market
square
there
they
herded
the
forty
silly
sheep
in
one
corner
of
the
livestock
enclosure
a
rod
or
two
distant
from
a
second
and
much
larger
flock
the
owner
of
this
second
flock
a
drover
named
bayne
had
no
dog
to
reinforce
his
shepherding
instead
three
of
his
hired
men
were
busily
running
and
shouting
along
the
wabbly
borders
of
the
flock
trent
observed
that
they
were
not
keeping
their
sheep
in
the
best
order
and
that
they
seemed
to
be
wilfully
exciting
instead
of
calming
the
big
flock
at
this
he
wondered
even
as
he
had
wondered
when
these
same
shepherds
had
been
equally
awkward
at
two
former
market
days
days
whereon
trent
himself
had
had
no
sheep
to
sell
he
had
heard
rumours
odd
unconfirmed
gossip
about
this
bayne
s
methods
and
when
he
was
not
watching
the
antics
of
the
three
clumsy
shepherds
he
observed
bayne
s
craggy
and
face
with
covert
interest
a
later
as
a
third
huddle
of
sheep
were
driven
into
the
enclosure
there
was
a
new
commotion
among
bayne
s
flock
all
three
shepherds
dashed
into
the
jostling
mass
as
in
an
effort
to
calm
the
pestered
beasts
instead
the
noisy
move
stampeded
the
entire
flock
they
scattered
broadcast
through
the
entire
enclosure
the
new
arrival
saw
the
panic
he
jumped
ahead
of
his
own
bunch
of
sheep
as
they
were
filing
in
and
drove
them
precipitately
out
of
the
square
standing
at
the
opening
to
see
that
none
of
bayne
s
stampeding
flock
should
follow
thus
by
rare
presence
of
mind
and
perhaps
having
also
had
experience
with
bayne
he
avoided
any
chance
of
his
sheep
mingling
with
the
runaways
michael
trent
was
less
fortunate
full
tilt
into
the
very
midst
of
his
orderly
flock
charged
some
fifty
of
bayne
s
stampeders
a
shepherd
at
their
heels
yelling
to
them
to
stop
the
shepherd
s
voice
and
excitement
had
merely
the
effect
of
urging
them
on
trent
watching
wondered
wrathfully
why
so
stupid
a
man
should
be
placed
in
charge
of
any
market
consignment
ragged
and
lean
were
the
newcomers
of
mixed
blood
and
in
bad
condition
as
was
the
way
with
bayne
s
livestock
they
were
not
to
be
compared
to
trent
s
fine
merinos
either
in
blood
or
in
condition
assuredly
not
in
value
into
and
through
the
trent
flock
swarmed
the
invaders
in
ten
seconds
the
two
flocks
were
inextricably
intertangled
in
vain
did
buff
seek
to
restore
order
he
could
do
nothing
against
three
men
four
now
for
bayne
had
joined
the
bedlam
whose
yells
and
crazy
rushes
frustrated
his
every
movement
the
dog
looked
up
in
angry
bewilderment
at
trent
mutely
begging
for
advice
as
to
how
the
snarl
might
be
straightened
out
but
trent
did
not
see
the
appealing
glance
his
mind
and
eyes
were
too
completely
taken
up
in
staring
at
bayne
and
the
latter
s
three
men
for
in
a
flash
the
quartet
had
changed
from
impotently
roaring
and
running
idiots
to
swiftly
certain
and
efficient
shepherds
with
splendid
skill
and
speed
they
were
quelling
the
stampede
separating
the
two
flocks
and
driving
their
own
sheep
to
their
allotted
corner
of
the
enclosure
their
command
of
the
situation
was
something
to
admire
presently
the
bayne
flock
was
in
its
place
orderly
and
safe
with
two
shepherds
in
front
of
it
to
prevent
further
panic
flight
trent
glanced
back
at
his
own
flock
attracted
to
them
by
a
sudden
stir
among
the
forty
buff
leaving
his
master
had
plunged
into
the
flock
and
was
busily
at
work
but
for
what
purpose
trent
could
not
guess
then
almost
at
once
he
was
out
of
the
compact
flock
again
driving
in
front
of
him
six
sheep
which
he
detached
from
the
remaining
and
sent
helter
skelter
out
into
the
middle
of
the
square
still
wondering
if
his
wise
dog
had
lost
his
wits
trent
chanced
to
take
special
note
of
the
six
sheep
as
they
hurtled
past
him
and
his
face
went
blank
the
six
were
dirty
thin
undersized
sparse
of
wool
they
were
as
different
from
his
own
plump
flock
as
a
scavenger
horse
from
a
derby
winner
before
trent
could
speak
or
move
buff
had
deserted
the
six
ragged
specimens
leaving
them
bleating
forlornly
in
the
centre
of
the
square
and
he
had
bounded
straight
at
bayne
s
flock
at
one
leap
he
was
on
the
backs
of
the
sheep
which
formed
the
outer
wall
of
the
mass
he
did
not
even
waste
time
to
plough
through
their
front
rank
over
their
backs
he
ran
and
on
until
he
vanished
into
the
milling
sea
of
wool
then
while
bayne
and
his
three
shepherds
still
shouted
in
uncomprehending
dismay
the
dog
appeared
again
on
one
edge
of
the
flock
moving
slowly
by
reason
of
the
press
around
and
ahead
of
him
he
emerged
from
the
bunch
driving
two
sheep
fat
they
were
and
of
heavy
wool
undoubted
merinos
both
across
the
narrow
space
buff
headed
them
and
drove
them
into
his
master
s
flock
then
on
the
instant
he
was
in
the
bayne
flock
again
running
once
more
over
the
scared
backs
of
many
sheep
and
dropping
to
earth
in
the
middle
of
the
throng
a
second
time
he
emerged
from
the
huddle
again
with
two
fat
and
woolly
merinos
ahead
of
him
eluding
bayne
who
rushed
down
on
him
with
staff
upraised
buff
galloped
the
two
into
his
master
s
corner
and
was
back
again
without
pausing
in
front
of
bayne
s
flock
but
this
time
his
job
was
no
sinecure
bayne
and
the
three
shepherds
had
shaken
off
their
amaze
and
were
ready
for
him
shouting
and
threatening
they
advanced
on
the
eager
dog
trent
leaving
his
sheep
in
care
of
an
official
of
the
market
sprang
to
buff
s
aid
but
the
dog
did
not
wait
for
him
instead
the
collie
made
a
growling
dash
at
bayne
s
booted
legs
bayne
jumped
aside
to
guard
his
endangered
shanks
and
smote
at
the
attacking
collie
with
his
staff
the
blow
did
not
land
buff
was
no
longer
there
eluding
the
swung
cudgel
with
wolfish
agility
he
darted
into
the
gap
in
the
line
the
gap
made
by
bayne
s
sideways
jump
and
was
at
the
fiercely
guarded
flock
once
more
as
buff
reappeared
after
an
interval
with
another
pair
of
sheep
herded
ahead
of
him
bayne
and
the
shepherds
were
waiting
for
him
but
so
was
trent
a
shepherd
made
a
lunging
rush
at
the
two
salvaged
sheep
bayne
aimed
a
murderous
blow
at
the
dog
trent
with
ludicrous
ease
tripped
the
awkwardly
charging
shepherd
and
sent
him
asprawl
on
the
ground
trent
s
staff
met
the
descending
stick
of
bayne
and
the
latter
s
weapon
was
shattered
by
the
impact
in
practically
the
same
gesture
trent
leaped
between
his
dog
and
the
two
remaining
shepherds
menacing
them
with
staff
and
voice
and
holding
them
in
check
while
the
collie
cantered
the
rescued
sheep
back
into
trent
s
flock
bayne
swearing
and
mouthing
strode
in
pursuit
he
was
met
by
a
crouching
collie
who
faced
him
with
an
expression
that
looked
like
a
smile
and
which
was
not
a
smile
bayne
hesitated
whirling
on
the
tranquil
trent
your
cur
s
stolen
six
of
my
sheep
he
thundered
in
righteous
indignation
i
ll
no
you
won
t
bayne
gently
contradicted
trent
his
pleasant
voice
slow
and
drawling
stop
a
second
and
cool
off
and
you
ll
let
the
matter
drop
you
ll
let
it
go
as
a
mistake
of
your
men
s
in
separating
the
two
flocks
men
often
make
mistakes
you
know
buff
never
does
there
are
six
sheep
straying
over
yonder
six
thin
sheep
not
merinos
they
are
i
tell
you
spluttered
bayne
though
visibly
uneasy
at
trent
s
manner
and
at
the
crowd
that
was
collecting
three
deep
around
them
no
intervened
trent
don
t
tell
me
bayne
don
t
bother
to
i
see
it
was
a
mistake
just
as
you
are
beginning
to
see
it
there
s
no
sin
in
a
mistake
though
there
s
always
sure
to
be
a
mistake
in
a
sin
my
sheep
are
safe
so
are
yours
let
the
matter
drop
i
ve
seen
stampedes
of
your
flocks
before
and
i
ve
heard
of
them
too
this
time
no
harm
s
done
that
s
all
i
i
ll
get
a
court
order
for
my
sheep
your
cur
run
off
flared
bayne
in
a
last
rally
and
he
turned
to
his
shepherds
commanding
here
boys
go
and
get
them
sheep
he
run
into
that
bunch
get
em
speaking
of
court
orders
said
trent
still
in
the
same
cool
slow
tones
of
indifference
and
interposing
his
own
lithe
body
beside
the
bristling
buff
s
to
the
hesitant
advance
of
the
shepherds
speaking
of
court
orders
bayne
when
you
get
yours
be
sure
to
tell
the
judge
that
i
m
ready
to
show
him
the
secret
mark
on
each
and
every
one
of
my
sheep
to
prove
they
re
mine
now
if
your
men
care
to
keep
on
edging
toward
my
flock
buff
and
i
will
try
to
entertain
them
as
best
we
can
till
the
police
come
bayne
glowered
horribly
into
the
smilingly
level
eyes
that
met
his
glare
so
tranquilly
then
with
a
grunt
he
turned
back
to
his
own
corner
the
three
shepherds
trailing
after
him
behind
his
calm
exterior
michael
trent
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
these
forty
sheep
of
his
were
culled
from
the
two
new
flocks
he
had
so
recently
purchased
none
of
them
bore
a
mark
the
only
secret
mark
on
them
was
buff
s
unerring
knowledge
of
their
identity
trent
stooped
and
petted
the
collie
lovingly
on
the
head
and
stroked
the
massive
ruff
that
s
how
bayne
makes
money
old
man
he
whispered
one
of
his
several
hundred
ways
we
couldn
t
have
proved
he
didn
t
have
six
fat
merinos
in
that
mangy
bunch
of
sheep
and
his
shepherds
would
have
sworn
to
them
figure
out
the
between
six
of
our
best
sheep
and
six
of
bayne
s
scarecrows
and
you
ll
know
to
a
penny
how
much
cash
you
ve
saved
me
the
collie
did
not
get
the
sense
of
one
word
in
five
but
he
realised
he
had
somehow
made
trent
very
proud
of
him
and
that
he
was
being
praised
so
for
a
moment
he
forgot
to
be
stately
and
aloof
he
wagged
his
tail
wildly
and
caught
trent
s
caressing
hand
between
his
mighty
jaws
in
savageness
pretending
to
bite
it
ferociously
while
not
exerting
the
pressure
of
a
fraction
of
an
ounce
which
was
one
of
buff
s
many
modes
of
showing
affection
for
the
man
who
was
his
master
and
his
god
dusk
had
fallen
when
trent
and
buff
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
the
silent
farmhouse
the
day
had
been
prosperous
the
merinos
had
brought
a
record
price
the
whole
forty
having
been
bought
by
an
stock
farm
man
thus
trent
s
investment
in
them
had
turned
into
an
unexpectedly
quick
and
large
profit
also
he
had
been
congratulated
by
a
dozen
fellow
sheep
raisers
on
his
victory
over
bayne
he
had
banked
his
market
cheque
the
boone
lake
bank
remaining
open
until
seven
in
the
evening
on
market
days
and
had
spent
a
blissful
on
the
hammerton
porch
with
ruth
on
the
way
home
now
comfortably
tired
and
buoyed
by
an
equally
comfortable
sense
of
he
lounged
up
the
short
path
leading
from
the
road
to
his
house
as
he
reached
the
fence
gate
he
had
bidden
buff
fetch
the
cows
from
their
upland
pasturage
and
drive
them
to
the
barn
he
himself
went
around
to
the
side
door
for
the
milk
pails
that
were
kept
in
the
kitchen
during
the
day
he
unlocked
and
opened
the
door
and
stepped
in
as
he
did
so
a
bag
was
thrown
over
his
head
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
a
bag
whose
bottom
was
soaked
in
something
that
smelt
like
crushed
apples
a
rope
was
flung
about
his
arms
at
the
same
moment
and
its
noose
ran
tight
vainly
trent
stamped
and
writhed
to
free
himself
his
wiry
strength
was
pinioned
and
cramped
by
the
noose
and
the
impeding
bag
more
of
the
liquid
was
dashed
into
his
face
through
the
sack
s
loose
meshes
then
as
he
still
struggled
and
choked
something
crashed
down
upon
his
skull
buff
trotted
obediently
across
the
road
toward
the
hill
pasture
like
his
master
buff
had
had
a
happy
and
busy
day
he
had
been
praised
much
and
petted
much
by
trent
and
had
had
a
truly
marvellous
dinner
at
the
boone
lake
hotel
he
was
complacently
at
peace
with
the
world
then
all
at
once
he
was
not
at
peace
with
anything
for
far
behind
him
he
heard
the
noise
of
scuffling
feet
and
of
a
loud
choking
gasp
and
his
weird
sixth
sense
told
him
his
master
was
in
trouble
wheeling
he
set
off
for
the
house
at
a
tearing
run
excited
as
he
was
he
was
aware
of
a
strange
and
vaguely
remembered
as
he
whirled
in
through
the
gate
and
up
the
path
his
faint
memory
of
the
scent
was
hostile
he
could
not
remember
why
at
a
bound
he
reached
the
open
kitchen
door
trent
was
lying
inert
and
crumpled
on
the
floor
two
men
were
bending
over
him
and
as
he
charged
buff
caught
their
scent
like
a
rabid
wolf
he
hurled
himself
upon
the
nearest
of
the
men
his
teeth
closed
in
hegan
s
shoulder
with
the
grip
of
his
pit
terrier
ancestors
at
the
same
moment
gates
drew
a
pistol
and
fired
point
blank
at
the
leaping
dog
buff
s
muscles
collapsed
he
slumped
to
the
floor
and
lay
lifelessly
across
the
body
of
his
master
what
d
you
shoot
for
you
chucklehead
panted
hegan
nursing
his
rent
shoulder
want
to
bring
all
boone
lake
down
on
us
only
way
to
get
him
retorted
gates
he
d
a
chewed
us
both
into
hamburg
steak
if
i
hadn
quickly
and
deftly
the
two
worked
first
assuring
themselves
that
no
one
had
heard
the
shot
they
went
through
the
house
and
through
trent
s
clothes
then
their
loot
gathered
they
carried
it
to
the
barn
and
stowed
it
in
trent
s
new
car
after
which
under
cover
of
darkness
and
carrying
trent
between
them
they
loaded
their
victim
into
the
tonneau
covering
him
with
a
blanket
then
while
hegan
groaningly
and
laboriously
cleaned
away
the
blood
spots
and
other
marks
of
struggle
gates
scowled
down
at
the
motionless
huddle
of
tawny
soft
fur
got
to
lug
him
along
with
us
too
i
s
pose
he
grunted
can
t
leave
him
get
a
stone
commanded
hegan
a
big
one
tie
it
around
his
neck
then
drop
him
down
the
gates
groped
around
the
steps
until
he
found
one
of
the
door
stones
and
in
another
minute
or
so
this
was
firmly
affixed
to
buff
s
collar
by
a
stout
rope
as
gates
picked
up
the
heavy
dog
and
carried
him
puffingly
to
the
well
the
telephone
bell
rung
tossing
dog
and
stone
over
the
well
curb
gates
bolted
for
the
house
in
sudden
fright
hegan
had
already
gone
into
the
hall
and
was
lifting
the
instrument
from
its
table
hallo
he
grunted
in
a
stifled
voice
as
he
motioned
gates
to
silence
his
face
cleared
and
he
made
answer
to
the
query
at
the
far
end
yep
this
is
michael
trent
yes
no
i
won
t
be
here
nope
i
m
just
starting
off
on
a
motor
trip
up
country
i
may
go
a
couple
of
thousand
miles
before
i
get
back
maybe
i
won
t
ever
come
back
i
m
dead
sick
of
this
hole
yep
he
hung
up
the
receiver
corking
good
alibi
he
chuckled
gleefully
some
feller
that
trent
sold
some
sheep
to
don
t
seem
to
know
trent
well
didn
t
suspicion
the
voice
now
when
trent
and
his
car
are
missing
nobody
ll
ask
nosey
questions
come
along
they
hurried
to
the
barn
backed
the
laden
car
out
and
drove
away
into
the
night
not
for
some
minutes
did
buff
recover
consciousness
from
the
bullet
graze
that
had
rapped
his
skull
so
hard
as
to
stun
him
and
to
gash
the
silken
fur
above
his
eye
he
woke
in
decided
discomfort
his
head
was
still
in
dire
pain
and
he
was
fastened
securely
in
one
spot
when
michael
trent
had
had
his
farm
drinking
water
tested
a
year
earlier
he
had
learned
that
the
well
showed
strong
traces
of
stable
drainage
wherefore
the
well
had
been
filled
up
to
within
two
yards
of
the
surface
and
a
new
well
had
been
dug
on
higher
ground
behind
the
house
thus
it
was
that
buff
woke
to
find
himself
sprawling
on
a
pile
of
rubble
with
a
short
rope
attaching
him
to
a
large
stone
indignantly
the
collie
set
to
work
gnawing
the
rope
in
two
this
accomplished
he
got
dizzily
to
his
feet
a
rush
and
a
scramble
and
he
was
up
the
wall
of
the
well
and
on
firm
ground
above
straight
to
the
house
he
ran
his
teeth
gleaming
his
ruff
abristle
at
the
kitchen
door
he
halted
the
door
was
shut
he
could
not
get
in
but
his
scent
told
him
trent
was
no
longer
there
his
scent
told
him
more
much
more
it
confirmed
his
memory
of
his
master
s
two
assailants
and
stamped
their
odour
for
ever
in
his
mind
their
steps
led
him
to
the
barn
whither
they
had
carried
trent
the
senseless
man
s
clothing
had
brushed
the
lintel
of
the
barn
door
as
they
had
lifted
him
into
the
car
buff
looked
wildly
about
him
sniffing
the
air
his
tense
brain
telling
him
much
then
a
red
light
began
to
smoulder
in
his
eyes
out
into
the
high
road
he
dashed
not
running
now
like
a
collie
but
like
a
timber
wolf
as
he
ran
he
paused
but
once
and
then
he
waited
only
long
enough
to
throw
his
head
aloft
and
shatter
the
night
silences
with
a
howl
as
hideous
and
discordant
as
it
was
a
mile
away
a
drowsy
farmer
dropped
his
weekly
paper
with
a
shiver
if
i
was
back
on
the
frontier
he
mused
to
his
startled
wife
i
d
say
that
was
a
mad
wolf
and
i
d
say
the
hunt
was
up
chapter
three
masterless
now
this
is
the
story
of
the
masterless
wanderings
of
buff
long
and
unavailingly
did
buff
follow
the
track
of
the
car
which
had
borne
away
the
man
who
was
his
god
dizzy
from
his
wound
faint
from
loss
of
blood
and
frantic
at
the
vanishing
of
his
master
the
collie
sped
in
pursuit
the
scent
was
fresh
in
his
nostrils
the
scent
of
the
kidnapped
man
and
of
his
abductors
and
the
familiar
odour
of
trent
s
car
mile
after
mile
galloped
buff
through
the
summer
night
trusting
wholly
to
his
sense
of
smell
with
the
peculiar
canter
of
his
he
stuck
to
the
trail
even
when
the
car
s
track
ceased
to
furrow
the
dusty
country
road
and
passed
clean
through
a
busy
little
city
through
the
city
s
myriad
odours
and
distractions
buff
stuck
to
the
scent
of
his
master
s
car
other
cars
hundreds
of
them
had
laced
the
trail
the
asphalt
s
smell
of
gasoline
and
grease
was
sickeningly
acute
in
the
dog
s
nostrils
confusing
and
sometimes
all
but
blotting
out
the
scent
he
was
following
yet
never
quite
did
buff
lose
the
track
under
the
lamps
of
and
trolley
cars
he
flashed
swerving
barely
far
enough
out
of
their
way
to
save
himself
from
death
then
ever
picking
up
the
scent
again
once
a
troop
of
small
boys
gave
chase
realising
the
chances
of
reward
that
lay
in
the
capture
of
so
fine
a
dog
but
buff
with
that
odd
and
choppy
of
his
soon
them
and
they
threw
stones
futilely
in
the
wake
of
the
flying
tawny
shape
again
a
great
dane
whirled
out
of
a
dooryard
and
pursued
the
passing
collie
buff
was
aware
of
the
larger
dog
s
presence
only
when
a
spring
and
a
snarl
warned
him
to
wheel
in
bare
time
to
avoid
the
full
shock
of
the
dane
s
charge
buff
had
no
time
for
fighting
paying
no
further
heed
to
the
attacking
giant
he
swerved
from
the
assault
caught
the
trail
again
and
increased
his
pace
but
the
great
dane
would
not
have
it
so
his
instincts
of
a
bully
were
aroused
by
the
meek
flight
of
this
stranger
dog
from
his
onset
and
he
pursued
at
top
speed
a
whirring
out
from
a
side
street
checked
buff
s
flight
for
an
instant
by
barring
the
way
before
he
could
get
into
his
stride
again
the
dane
had
hurled
himself
upon
the
fugitive
bearing
him
to
the
ground
in
the
slime
and
mud
of
the
greasy
street
by
the
time
buff
s
tawny
back
smote
the
asphalt
he
was
master
of
the
situation
furious
at
this
abominable
delay
he
reverted
to
type
or
to
two
types
it
was
his
that
lent
him
the
wit
and
the
nimbleness
to
spin
to
his
feet
under
the
big
assailant
s
lunging
body
and
to
find
by
instinct
the
hind
leg
tendon
of
the
lumbering
brute
all
this
in
one
lightning
swirl
and
before
the
dane
could
slacken
his
own
pace
but
it
was
his
pit
terrier
strain
that
made
him
set
his
curved
deep
and
firmly
in
that
tendon
and
to
hold
his
grip
with
a
steadfastness
and
might
while
he
ground
his
jaws
slowly
together
almost
before
the
smitten
mongrel
could
shriek
forth
his
agony
and
fear
before
the
toppling
gigantic
body
could
crash
to
the
ground
the
jaws
had
met
in
the
centre
of
the
thing
they
gripped
and
leaving
behind
him
the
crippled
and
howling
bully
buff
slipped
through
the
human
crowd
that
had
begun
to
collect
and
was
casting
about
once
more
for
the
trail
of
trent
s
car
in
a
moment
he
had
found
it
and
he
sped
along
in
renewed
zest
through
the
city
and
out
into
its
straggling
suburbs
galloped
buff
there
a
mile
beyond
was
a
wayside
garage
with
one
or
two
ramshackle
buildings
on
either
side
of
it
behind
them
a
rotting
dock
nosed
its
way
out
into
the
river
here
at
times
tugs
and
tenders
and
lighters
touched
on
their
way
between
the
city
and
the
ocean
harbour
eight
miles
to
southward
at
the
garage
the
trail
ended
here
had
halted
michael
trent
s
car
buff
ran
twice
around
the
closed
garage
his
nostrils
told
him
the
car
was
inside
that
dark
and
deserted
building
he
had
followed
it
twenty
miles
or
more
he
was
worn
out
from
the
run
yet
here
the
scent
of
his
adored
master
was
stronger
than
it
had
been
anywhere
along
the
way
the
dog
scratched
imperiously
at
the
garage
door
the
sagging
wood
shook
and
grumbled
under
the
impact
but
it
held
firm
nor
did
anyone
come
from
inside
to
answer
the
summons
frightened
at
the
silence
yet
certain
of
the
scent
he
sought
buff
circled
the
building
once
more
nose
to
earth
steps
uncertain
head
darting
from
side
to
side
the
quest
did
not
bring
to
his
senses
any
trace
of
trent
but
it
did
bring
to
him
a
dual
odour
that
set
the
dog
s
ruff
to
bristling
and
his
teeth
to
glinting
from
under
his
uncurled
lip
for
here
side
by
side
had
trodden
hegan
and
gates
not
more
than
an
hour
earlier
they
had
walked
here
their
heels
striking
deep
in
the
dirt
as
though
they
carried
between
them
some
heavy
weight
they
had
walked
thus
to
the
dock
and
to
its
outer
edge
baffled
the
collie
made
his
way
back
to
the
garage
there
distinct
through
the
reek
of
gas
and
oil
and
dead
tobacco
and
dried
grease
he
caught
again
the
scent
of
his
master
with
a
little
whimper
of
eagerness
buff
paused
beneath
a
shut
and
locked
window
some
three
feet
from
the
ground
he
gathered
his
waning
strength
for
one
more
effort
and
sprang
upward
through
the
thin
and
cracked
glass
and
the
rotting
sash
he
clove
his
way
alighting
on
the
slimy
concrete
floor
of
the
garage
amid
a
shower
of
window
particles
the
glass
by
some
minor
miracle
scarce
cut
the
dog
apart
from
a
scratch
or
two
on
his
pads
and
a
shallow
cut
on
the
nose
he
was
none
the
worse
for
his
dive
through
the
shaky
casement
the
instant
he
touched
ground
buff
was
in
new
search
of
his
master
s
scent
and
at
once
he
found
it
there
were
three
cars
in
the
garage
two
of
them
were
old
and
battered
and
in
parlous
condition
the
third
was
still
new
and
to
this
new
car
buff
ran
it
was
michael
trent
s
car
empty
as
it
was
now
even
of
cushions
and
dashboard
equipments
and
shorn
of
its
license
numbers
buff
knew
it
at
a
single
sniff
he
knew
more
he
knew
that
in
this
car
s
muddied
tonneau
little
over
half
an
hour
ago
trent
had
been
lying
yes
and
that
gates
and
hegan
had
been
occupying
the
front
seat
also
that
the
nasty
smell
of
some
medicine
or
drug
was
strong
in
the
tonneau
but
the
one
thing
that
interested
buff
was
michael
trent
s
recent
presence
there
being
only
a
dog
and
not
a
detective
it
occurred
quite
naturally
to
buff
that
where
trent
had
so
lately
been
he
would
in
time
be
again
trent
had
left
the
car
that
was
evident
but
doubtless
he
would
return
to
it
every
day
he
used
this
car
and
of
course
he
would
come
back
to
it
soon
or
late
wherefore
as
trent
s
trail
led
no
farther
there
seemed
nothing
for
buff
to
do
but
to
wait
for
him
here
accordingly
the
collie
stepped
up
on
the
running
board
and
through
the
open
doorway
of
the
tonneau
stretching
himself
out
there
as
close
as
possible
to
the
space
where
trent
had
lain
buff
began
his
vigil
waiting
in
worried
patience
for
the
return
of
the
man
whom
he
had
chosen
as
his
deity
and
so
in
time
he
fell
asleep
nature
renewing
itself
in
his
tired
body
and
building
up
again
the
strong
young
tissues
and
the
wonted
vigour
of
frame
and
of
brain
fast
as
the
dog
had
run
and
with
as
few
delays
yet
he
had
arrived
far
too
late
to
ameliorate
or
even
share
his
master
s
doom
fast
as
a
collie
can
run
and
no
dog
but
the
greyhound
can
outstrip
him
yet
a
new
and
desperately
driven
can
cover
thrice
the
same
ground
in
far
less
time
than
can
he
moreover
buff
had
wasted
many
precious
minutes
in
senselessness
in
the
waterless
well
and
many
more
in
gnawing
through
the
rope
and
in
casting
about
the
farmhouse
and
in
the
yard
for
trent
s
trail
more
than
an
hour
ahead
of
him
gates
and
hegan
had
reached
their
destination
they
had
disposed
of
the
stolen
car
borne
off
the
valuables
they
had
taken
from
trent
s
home
and
from
his
body
and
did
all
else
they
had
planned
in
advance
to
do
the
only
creature
with
a
clue
to
the
victim
s
whereabouts
had
come
up
an
hour
too
late
it
was
daylight
when
buff
awoke
he
was
stiff
and
drowsy
the
bullet
graze
and
the
glass
cut
on
his
head
were
throbbing
he
was
thirsty
too
and
hungry
he
did
not
wake
of
his
own
accord
but
through
force
of
habit
as
the
crunching
of
human
feet
reached
his
sleeping
senses
he
lifted
his
head
steps
were
clumping
up
to
the
garage
door
and
a
key
was
at
work
in
the
padlock
buff
was
keenly
interested
a
dog
awakens
instantly
and
with
all
his
faculties
acute
with
him
there
is
none
of
the
owlish
stupidity
and
dazedness
which
marks
the
transition
from
sleep
to
awake
among
humans
at
one
instant
he
is
fast
asleep
at
the
next
he
is
wide
awake
and
so
it
was
with
buff
he
was
interested
now
at
the
sound
of
steps
because
he
hoped
one
of
the
two
men
whose
tread
he
heard
might
be
michael
trent
but
at
once
he
knew
it
was
not
trent
s
step
was
as
familiar
to
buff
as
was
trent
s
scent
and
neither
of
these
two
approaching
persons
had
a
semblance
to
trent
s
light
springy
stride
indeed
before
the
garage
door
opened
more
than
an
inch
buff
s
nostrils
told
him
that
these
newcomers
were
total
strangers
to
him
one
of
the
two
men
was
elderly
and
disreputable
the
other
a
mere
boy
had
not
lived
long
enough
to
look
as
thoroughly
disreputable
as
did
his
companion
but
very
evidently
he
had
done
his
best
along
that
line
in
the
few
years
allotted
him
the
older
man
was
approaching
trent
s
car
talking
over
his
shoulder
to
the
youth
put
them
new
license
plates
on
this
first
thing
you
do
he
commanded
then
get
a
chisel
and
see
what
you
can
do
with
the
motor
number
and
we
ll
have
to
he
stopped
with
much
abruptness
as
he
had
been
speaking
he
had
advanced
to
trent
s
car
and
had
laid
a
careless
hand
on
the
swinging
tonneau
door
at
the
same
moment
he
was
aware
of
a
tawny
shape
bloody
of
head
that
arose
from
the
depths
of
the
tonneau
teeth
bared
and
eyes
menacing
this
car
belonged
to
michael
trent
as
much
as
did
the
trent
farmhouse
long
since
buff
had
learned
that
it
was
his
sacred
duty
to
guard
the
one
as
rigidly
as
the
other
and
here
this
stranger
was
laying
an
impious
hand
on
the
machine
at
the
apparition
of
the
threatening
head
and
at
the
sound
of
the
equally
threatening
growl
the
man
recoiled
from
the
car
jerking
back
his
dirty
hand
from
the
door
as
suddenly
as
if
the
latter
had
turned
into
a
snake
the
two
men
surveyed
buff
quietly
but
not
at
all
friendlily
the
collie
returned
their
stare
he
had
no
quarrel
with
either
of
them
for
all
he
knew
or
cared
this
might
be
their
rightful
home
so
long
as
they
should
abstain
from
touching
or
otherwise
molesting
trent
s
car
he
was
content
to
let
them
alone
but
his
pose
and
expression
made
it
very
clear
that
he
expected
the
same
sort
of
treatment
from
them
and
that
he
was
calmly
ready
to
enforce
such
treatment
it
s
it
s
why
it
s
a
dog
cleverly
observed
the
youth
breaking
the
momentary
silence
of
surprise
it
s
it
s
a
collie
amended
his
senior
finding
his
voice
and
his
wits
together
a
at
that
must
have
sneaked
in
here
while
we
was
closin
up
last
night
a
dog
like
that
is
worth
a
big
heap
of
cash
and
most
likely
there
ll
be
a
reward
offered
for
him
see
he
s
got
a
good
collar
on
and
he
s
chawed
his
rope
through
he
s
worth
keepin
till
called
for
go
catch
him
sonny
and
tie
him
up
yonder
till
we
c
n
take
him
over
to
the
the
man
spoke
wheedlingly
to
his
young
companion
but
the
lad
had
noted
his
sire
s
own
reception
from
buff
and
modestly
he
hung
back
at
the
other
s
repeated
and
sterner
mandate
the
youth
remarked
think
i
ll
run
up
home
for
breakfast
i
ll
be
back
in
ten
minutes
you
might
tie
him
up
yourself
while
i
m
gone
i
ain
t
much
used
to
the
older
man
scowled
then
his
brow
cleared
we
ll
both
go
up
to
breakfast
he
decreed
we
ll
lock
this
feller
in
here
while
we
re
gone
on
the
way
back
i
ll
stop
for
joe
stears
he
s
got
a
passel
of
dogs
and
he
und
stands
handlin
em
come
compromising
thus
they
departed
closing
and
locking
the
garage
door
behind
them
neither
of
them
having
gone
to
the
far
side
of
the
room
they
did
not
see
the
broken
sash
and
the
mess
of
glass
on
the
floor
a
bit
of
wreckage
hidden
from
their
view
by
the
three
cars
for
a
few
minutes
after
they
left
him
buff
lay
still
then
he
got
up
stretched
fore
and
aft
collie
fashion
and
stepped
down
to
the
concrete
floor
making
his
way
across
to
a
he
drank
long
and
deep
then
he
stood
irresolute
he
had
been
in
this
place
for
many
hours
michael
trent
had
not
returned
to
his
car
michael
trent
s
odour
had
grown
faint
almost
imperceptible
there
was
no
reason
after
all
to
believe
that
trent
would
come
back
here
a
few
months
ago
he
had
taken
his
old
car
to
a
garage
and
had
never
gone
back
for
it
perhaps
that
was
what
he
would
do
in
the
present
case
meanwhile
buff
was
bitterly
homesick
for
his
master
and
buff
was
worried
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
as
to
what
might
have
befallen
trent
at
the
hands
of
the
two
men
with
whom
the
dog
associated
his
master
s
departure
the
men
he
was
learning
to
hate
with
a
mortal
hatred
because
he
knew
them
for
his
master
s
enemies
by
loitering
here
he
could
get
no
trace
of
trent
nor
of
the
men
who
had
carried
him
away
refreshed
and
once
more
alert
he
prepared
to
take
up
his
quest
again
an
easy
leap
carried
buff
out
through
the
smashed
window
and
to
freedom
as
he
stood
in
the
road
hesitant
he
saw
bearing
down
toward
him
at
a
run
the
two
men
who
had
just
left
the
garage
and
with
them
a
third
man
who
carried
a
rope
and
a
club
as
the
trio
very
evidently
meant
to
seize
him
and
as
he
had
no
reason
for
staying
there
in
the
road
to
be
caught
the
collie
set
off
across
the
nearest
field
at
a
heading
for
a
distant
patch
of
woods
the
men
gave
chase
but
without
bothering
to
increase
his
speed
he
soon
left
them
panting
and
swearing
far
in
the
rear
presently
they
gave
up
the
pursuit
midway
in
the
field
buff
scared
up
an
unwary
young
rabbit
at
sight
of
the
pneumatically
bouncing
cottontail
the
collie
remembered
he
himself
had
eaten
nothing
in
nearly
hours
like
a
furry
whirlwind
he
was
after
the
rabbit
fifty
yards
on
a
swirl
in
the
long
grass
and
a
few
leaves
marked
the
abrupt
end
of
the
race
and
buff
found
himself
supplied
with
a
toothsome
breakfast
thus
began
the
collie
s
first
day
of
utter
loneliness
a
day
of
bleak
misery
and
bewilderment
of
biting
grief
he
ranged
the
country
for
miles
on
either
side
for
a
trace
of
his
master
he
followed
several
on
various
highways
because
of
their
vague
resemblance
to
trent
s
once
he
ran
rapturously
for
a
in
pursuit
of
a
man
who
was
taking
a
tramp
and
whom
in
the
distance
his
eyes
mistook
for
his
master
the
wind
being
in
the
wrong
direction
buff
was
not
aware
of
his
error
until
he
had
careered
to
within
fifty
feet
of
the
stranger
then
head
and
brush
drooping
he
slunk
away
heavy
of
heart
and
heedless
of
the
man
s
kindly
hail
under
cover
of
darkness
that
evening
the
collie
made
a
detour
that
brought
him
back
to
the
garage
where
last
he
had
seen
trent
s
car
whether
he
hoped
trent
might
have
come
back
there
or
whether
perhaps
the
desolate
dog
craved
the
faint
scent
of
his
master
on
the
tonneau
door
and
flooring
in
any
event
he
leaped
in
through
the
unmended
window
of
the
garage
and
sought
to
locate
the
stolen
car
the
car
was
no
longer
there
after
the
deft
underground
method
employed
by
professional
automobile
thieves
and
receivers
of
such
booty
the
car
had
already
been
passed
along
the
line
to
its
next
a
boy
coming
home
late
from
the
city
chanced
to
be
passing
the
unlit
garage
from
the
cavernous
depths
of
the
building
burst
forth
into
the
still
night
a
hideous
sound
the
anguish
howl
of
a
wolf
or
of
a
masterless
and
wretched
collie
while
the
boy
still
stood
shivering
in
terror
at
the
eerie
sound
a
dark
shape
hurtled
out
through
the
window
and
vanished
into
the
surrounding
blackness
and
now
began
buff
s
tortured
experience
as
a
stray
as
a
leal
dog
whose
master
is
gone
goaded
on
ever
by
that
vague
hope
of
somewhere
finding
trent
and
the
scarce
lesser
hope
of
finding
and
wreaking
vengeance
on
the
men
he
associated
with
trent
s
disappearance
the
great
collie
wandered
aimlessly
over
the
face
of
the
countryside
unhappiness
and
the
of
his
endless
quest
lent
him
a
strange
furtiveness
and
made
him
revert
in
a
measure
to
the
wild
always
searching
always
avoiding
his
own
kind
and
humans
he
grew
gaunt
and
lean
living
by
his
wits
in
summer
the
forests
gave
him
enough
food
to
support
life
he
became
craftily
adept
in
catching
rabbits
and
squirrels
and
even
occasional
young
birds
he
did
not
starve
for
the
lent
him
the
gift
of
foraging
although
his
farm
training
held
him
aloof
from
and
stall
and
fold
in
his
almost
at
once
he
skirted
the
city
and
guided
himself
back
to
boone
lake
nearly
thirty
miles
from
where
the
trail
had
ended
the
feat
was
not
difficult
and
he
consumed
less
than
a
single
night
on
the
journey
reaching
his
master
s
farm
at
grey
of
dawn
buff
found
the
house
and
outbuildings
deserted
the
weeds
had
crept
thick
among
the
once
trim
crops
and
there
was
an
air
of
desolation
brooding
over
the
land
buff
could
not
know
that
of
all
boone
lake
ruth
hammerton
alone
had
refused
to
accept
as
true
the
report
that
michael
trent
had
left
home
of
his
own
accord
she
had
visited
the
deserted
farm
with
her
father
as
soon
as
the
story
had
been
repeated
to
her
and
had
prevailed
on
hammerton
to
send
one
of
his
to
transfer
to
the
hammertons
place
trent
s
suffering
livestock
for
it
was
enough
for
the
collie
to
know
his
master
was
not
at
home
and
that
he
had
not
been
at
home
since
the
night
of
his
kidnapping
buff
did
not
belong
to
the
silly
and
professionally
loyal
type
of
dog
that
curls
itself
on
its
owner
s
vacant
doorstep
and
starves
to
death
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
such
selfish
matters
as
death
while
michael
trent
remained
to
be
found
and
his
two
enemies
to
be
tracked
down
so
aimlessly
he
took
up
his
search
that
night
he
circled
boone
lake
investigating
every
house
and
path
that
trent
had
been
wont
to
frequent
visiting
first
the
hammerton
place
and
last
the
market
square
the
scene
of
his
triumph
over
bayne
the
drover
dawn
found
him
miles
away
ever
seeking
ever
wandering
living
on
slain
forest
creatures
obsessed
and
haunted
by
his
overmastering
impulse
to
find
trent
once
as
he
trotted
along
the
ridge
of
a
wooded
hill
buff
saw
in
the
valley
below
a
farmer
trying
with
pitiable
to
round
up
a
flock
of
sixty
sheep
that
had
bolted
through
the
pasture
gate
and
were
scattering
over
the
surrounding
fields
and
woods
instead
of
marching
toward
their
distant
fold
whose
gate
stood
invitingly
open
moved
by
an
instinct
he
did
not
stay
to
define
or
to
resist
the
collie
swept
down
the
ridge
and
into
the
valley
below
the
harassed
farmer
beheld
descending
on
his
stampeded
flock
a
bolt
of
lightning
that
whirled
in
and
out
among
the
galloping
strays
as
if
bent
on
their
wholesale
destruction
while
the
man
was
yelling
his
lungs
out
and
seeking
a
stone
wherewith
to
brain
the
marauder
he
suddenly
came
to
a
foolish
halt
and
stood
gaping
at
the
spectacle
before
him
the
supposedly
rabid
and
murderous
dog
was
rounding
up
the
scattered
flock
with
uncanny
skill
and
speed
marshalling
them
into
the
narrow
road
driving
strays
back
into
the
column
and
moving
the
whole
woolly
throng
steadily
and
decorously
toward
the
fold
arrived
at
the
gate
one
wether
bolted
past
it
and
ten
other
sheep
followed
his
lead
the
wether
did
not
go
forty
feet
before
he
and
his
found
themselves
confronted
by
a
large
and
indignant
collie
who
forced
them
with
gentle
relentlessness
to
wheel
in
their
tracks
and
rejoin
the
flock
tongue
out
tail
wagging
buff
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
fold
holding
his
prisoners
from
passing
out
again
until
the
puffing
and
marvelling
farmer
came
running
up
the
man
paused
to
fasten
the
gate
before
turning
his
full
attention
on
the
wonderful
collie
but
by
the
time
the
gate
was
made
fast
the
dog
was
a
hundred
yards
down
the
road
trotting
lazily
back
toward
the
ridge
not
by
so
much
as
a
turn
of
his
classic
head
did
he
show
he
heard
the
frantic
and
cajoling
shouts
the
farmer
sent
after
him
on
another
late
afternoon
ten
miles
from
there
a
farmer
s
child
was
piloting
her
father
s
eleven
cows
and
two
calves
home
along
the
road
from
pasture
three
men
passing
in
a
small
halted
jumped
to
the
ground
seized
the
pair
of
calves
and
prepared
to
sling
them
into
the
truck
the
child
screamed
in
terrified
appeal
and
caught
hold
of
one
of
the
men
by
the
arm
while
the
herd
of
cows
ran
in
panic
through
fields
and
woods
the
man
shook
off
the
child
s
convulsive
hold
with
a
vehemence
that
sent
her
flat
in
the
dust
of
the
road
and
on
the
same
instant
a
huge
and
lean
and
hairy
beast
burst
through
a
roadside
thicket
and
flung
himself
on
the
man
bearing
him
to
earth
by
the
sheer
weight
of
his
assault
by
the
time
the
thief
had
landed
rolling
and
yelling
in
the
roadway
buff
had
deserted
him
and
was
at
another
of
the
trio
and
this
was
the
collie
of
it
a
bulldog
secures
his
grip
and
holds
it
till
doomsday
a
collie
fighting
is
everywhere
at
once
the
collie
strain
in
buff
told
him
his
opponents
were
three
and
that
there
was
no
sense
in
devoting
himself
to
any
one
of
them
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
so
he
was
raging
at
the
second
man
s
throat
before
the
first
fairly
realised
what
had
attacked
him
the
third
man
however
had
a
trifle
more
time
on
his
hands
than
had
either
of
his
companions
and
wisely
he
utilised
that
second
of
time
in
dropping
the
calf
he
had
caught
and
in
making
one
flying
leap
for
the
seat
of
the
truck
there
as
fast
as
they
could
beat
off
the
furry
demon
that
was
rending
their
flesh
and
clothes
the
two
others
joined
him
leaving
the
calves
to
run
free
the
men
set
the
machine
into
rapid
motion
and
rattled
off
down
the
road
buff
did
not
follow
already
he
was
in
the
thickets
again
rounding
up
the
gawkily
galloping
cows
and
presently
he
had
them
back
in
the
highway
in
orderly
alignment
and
walking
stolidly
homeward
dropping
back
beside
the
still
weeping
child
buff
licked
her
frightened
face
with
his
pink
tongue
wagged
his
tail
and
his
entire
body
reassuringly
and
then
thrust
his
muzzle
into
her
trembling
little
hand
thus
her
father
having
witnessed
the
scene
from
afar
came
hurrying
up
to
find
his
cattle
safe
and
in
the
road
and
his
erstwhile
terrified
daughter
hugging
a
huge
collie
frantically
and
kissing
the
silken
crest
of
the
dog
s
head
in
an
agony
of
gratitude
and
love
but
as
the
farmer
himself
sought
to
catch
hold
of
the
dog
buff
showed
his
white
teeth
in
a
snarl
that
made
the
man
start
back
taking
advantage
of
this
momentary
check
the
collie
bounded
off
into
the
bushes
and
was
gone
buff
himself
could
not
have
explained
the
unwonted
wildness
and
ferocity
that
seemed
to
have
taken
hold
of
him
in
his
wanderings
for
the
first
three
years
or
so
of
his
life
indeed
until
gates
s
pistol
shot
had
stunned
him
he
had
known
nothing
but
friendliness
and
good
treatment
and
except
toward
tramps
and
like
prowlers
he
had
never
felt
hatred
though
he
had
always
been
a
dog
he
had
shown
no
toward
those
who
sought
to
make
friends
with
him
yet
now
as
evidenced
by
his
snarl
at
the
father
of
the
child
who
was
caressing
him
he
had
neither
lot
nor
part
with
mankind
at
large
his
every
hope
and
yearning
were
centred
on
the
finding
of
his
master
and
the
wolf
strain
in
his
thrilled
almost
as
keenly
to
his
longing
to
encounter
the
men
with
whom
he
associated
the
disappearance
of
trent
for
the
rest
of
humanity
he
felt
no
interest
not
even
toward
ruth
hammerton
who
had
reigned
second
to
trent
in
his
heart
twice
during
his
months
as
a
tramp
dog
buff
revisited
boone
lake
casting
about
the
farm
trotting
at
midnight
through
the
village
hanging
wistfully
around
the
hammerton
place
for
nearly
an
hour
but
before
dawn
he
was
far
away
again
most
of
his
travelling
was
done
by
night
or
in
dusk
and
at
grey
daybreak
for
experience
had
taught
him
that
the
open
ways
are
not
safe
for
an
unattached
dog
by
sunlight
a
lesser
dog
might
readily
have
attached
himself
to
one
of
the
various
friendly
folk
who
chanced
to
meet
him
and
to
give
him
a
kindly
word
or
call
a
lesser
dog
too
might
have
chosen
a
home
at
one
of
the
farms
scattered
through
the
broad
stretch
of
country
buff
traversed
at
any
of
a
dozen
places
his
beauty
and
his
prowess
at
herding
would
have
won
for
the
collie
a
warm
and
lasting
welcome
but
none
of
this
was
for
buff
he
had
known
but
one
master
losing
trent
he
was
fated
to
be
forever
masterless
unless
he
should
chance
to
find
the
man
he
had
lost
and
being
only
a
dog
he
knew
no
better
way
of
finding
him
than
by
this
everlasting
and
aimless
search
on
a
late
september
afternoon
he
was
roused
from
a
troubled
nap
in
the
long
grass
and
bushes
at
the
verge
of
a
field
by
the
sound
of
a
horse
and
of
a
woman
s
brave
yet
frightened
calls
to
the
runaway
looking
over
the
fringe
of
grass
towards
the
road
a
furlong
distant
he
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
which
resolved
itself
into
a
hazy
screen
for
a
horse
and
light
buggy
the
horse
a
young
and
nervous
brute
had
taken
fright
at
the
running
of
a
woodchuck
across
the
road
under
his
feet
and
had
sprung
forward
with
a
suddenness
that
snapped
his
the
swinging
check
smote
him
resoundingly
again
and
again
on
the
neck
and
across
the
face
turning
his
first
fright
into
panic
and
making
useless
the
efforts
of
the
driver
to
bring
him
down
a
woman
was
driving
she
was
neither
young
nor
beautiful
she
had
and
she
had
a
more
than
tolerable
set
of
driving
hands
she
was
keeping
the
maddened
horse
more
or
less
in
the
road
and
was
sawing
with
valorous
strength
on
one
rein
while
she
held
the
other
steady
which
was
all
the
good
it
did
her
for
the
brute
had
the
bit
between
his
teeth
buff
arrived
at
the
just
as
one
of
the
two
light
reins
broke
under
the
undue
strain
put
on
it
before
the
driver
could
lighten
the
pull
on
the
remaining
rein
its
impulse
had
jerked
the
horse
s
head
far
to
one
side
his
rushing
body
prepared
to
follow
the
lead
of
his
head
towards
a
steep
roadside
bank
some
ten
feet
deep
with
a
scattering
of
broken
rock
at
the
bottom
then
it
was
that
the
horse
became
dimly
aware
of
a
furry
shape
which
whizzed
in
front
of
him
on
that
side
and
of
a
flying
head
that
struck
for
his
nose
a
stinging
slash
on
the
left
nostril
sent
the
runaway
veering
from
the
and
plunging
toward
the
telegraph
pole
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
he
was
met
and
turned
again
by
a
second
slash
from
one
of
the
collie
s
curved
on
the
same
moment
buff
stopped
slashing
and
let
his
bulldog
ancestry
take
control
thus
the
horse
was
assailed
by
a
full
double
set
of
teeth
that
buried
themselves
in
his
bleeding
nostrils
and
that
hung
on
the
wild
steed
sought
to
fling
up
his
head
to
shake
off
this
anguishing
weight
of
seventy
odd
pounds
but
he
could
not
shake
himself
free
he
checked
his
furious
pace
and
reared
striking
out
with
his
forefeet
and
threatening
to
pitch
backward
into
the
buggy
but
a
fierce
wrench
of
the
hanging
jaws
and
a
wriggle
of
the
intolerable
weight
brought
him
down
on
all
fours
again
at
once
buff
released
his
grip
and
stood
in
front
of
the
trembling
horse
the
runaway
made
as
though
to
plunge
forward
but
he
flinched
at
the
memory
of
the
dog
s
attack
and
at
the
threat
of
its
renewal
while
he
hesitated
dancing
pawing
and
in
momentary
cessation
of
his
run
the
woman
slipped
from
the
seat
to
the
ground
and
ran
to
his
head
with
practised
strength
she
shook
the
bit
into
place
and
held
fast
the
horse
jerked
back
buff
nipped
his
heel
and
instantly
was
at
his
bloody
nose
again
the
runaway
conquered
and
shivering
lashed
out
with
one
foreleg
in
a
last
hopeless
display
of
terrified
anger
his
shod
hoof
smote
the
unprepared
collie
in
the
side
with
a
gasping
sound
buff
rolled
over
into
the
ditch
two
ribs
broken
and
a
foot
crushed
tying
the
horse
to
a
telegraph
pole
the
woman
went
over
to
where
the
wounded
collie
lay
in
strong
capable
arms
that
were
wondrous
gentle
she
lifted
him
and
bore
him
to
the
buggy
laying
him
tenderly
on
the
floor
of
the
vehicle
she
returned
to
the
horse
s
head
untied
the
cowed
and
trembling
steed
and
began
to
lead
him
homeward
ten
minutes
later
she
turned
in
at
a
lane
leading
to
a
rambling
low
farmhouse
and
in
another
five
minutes
buff
was
reclining
on
the
kitchen
floor
the
woman
s
husband
working
skilfully
over
his
injuries
while
the
matron
poured
out
the
tale
of
his
heroism
and
cleverness
i
know
what
dog
this
is
too
she
finished
i
m
sure
i
know
it
must
be
the
same
one
that
fought
those
thieves
away
from
sol
gilbert
s
cows
over
to
pompton
last
week
when
sol
s
girl
was
driving
them
home
gilbert
told
me
about
it
at
the
grange
monday
and
he
s
likely
the
dog
that
rounded
up
those
sheep
for
parkins
or
whatever
his
name
was
at
revere
you
read
me
about
it
in
the
don
t
you
remember
the
letter
parkins
wrote
to
the
editor
about
it
i
know
it
must
be
the
same
one
it
isn
t
likely
there
s
more
than
one
dog
in
passaic
county
with
the
sense
to
do
all
three
of
those
things
he
must
be
like
those
folks
in
sylvia
s
school
book
who
used
to
go
through
the
country
rescuing
folks
that
were
in
distress
the
best
in
the
house
isn
t
any
too
good
for
he
ll
get
it
curtly
promised
her
husband
without
looking
up
from
his
task
it
s
lucky
i
ve
had
experience
though
in
patching
up
busted
critters
because
this
one
is
needing
a
lot
of
patching
say
notice
how
he
don
t
even
let
a
whimper
out
of
him
this
must
hurt
like
fury
too
acts
more
like
a
bulldog
than
a
collie
i
m
going
to
advertise
him
and
if
the
owner
shows
up
i
ll
offer
him
a
hundred
dollars
for
the
dog
he
ll
be
worth
it
and
a
heap
more
to
me
herding
and
such
old
feller
now
for
the
smashed
foot
don
t
seem
to
be
any
big
bones
broke
the
weeks
that
followed
were
more
nearly
pleasant
to
buff
than
had
been
any
space
of
time
since
trent
s
disappearance
he
was
perforce
at
rest
while
his
fractured
ribs
and
then
his
broken
foot
slowly
mended
and
all
that
time
he
was
fed
up
and
petted
and
made
much
of
in
a
way
that
would
have
turned
most
invalids
heads
it
was
well
after
his
months
of
restless
searchings
to
come
to
a
halt
here
in
this
abode
of
comfort
and
kindliness
to
be
petted
again
by
a
woman
s
soft
hand
to
eat
cooked
food
once
more
to
be
praised
and
to
feel
himself
gloriously
welcome
buff
s
craving
ambition
to
find
trent
and
to
run
to
earth
his
two
enemies
was
less
acute
in
these
drowsy
days
of
convalescence
his
sick
soul
seemed
to
be
returning
to
normal
along
with
his
sick
body
by
the
time
buff
could
walk
with
any
degree
of
comfort
again
the
morning
frost
lay
heavy
on
the
fields
the
dog
went
out
for
a
brief
stroll
with
the
farmer
and
his
wife
to
their
delight
he
did
not
try
to
run
away
but
accompanied
them
home
and
lay
down
contentedly
on
the
doorstep
after
that
no
further
guard
was
kept
over
him
it
was
understood
that
he
would
stay
with
the
people
who
had
succoured
and
healed
him
one
cold
night
in
late
autumn
the
dog
accompanied
his
host
as
usual
on
the
evening
rounds
of
barns
and
outbuildings
as
they
were
returning
towards
the
warm
red
glow
of
the
lamplit
kitchen
windows
buff
came
to
a
dead
stop
a
slight
shudder
ran
through
him
he
lifted
his
delicate
nose
and
sniffed
the
frosty
air
he
smelt
nothing
he
sniffed
merely
in
an
effort
to
corroborate
in
some
way
by
scent
the
strange
impulse
which
was
taking
possession
of
him
an
impulse
he
could
not
resist
come
along
shep
old
boy
coaxed
the
farmer
arriving
at
the
doorstep
and
turning
back
towards
the
collie
supper
s
ready
what
s
the
matter
slowly
very
slowly
buff
approached
the
man
timidly
almost
remorsefully
he
licked
the
outstretched
hand
then
throwing
back
his
magnificent
head
he
made
the
stillnesses
of
the
autumn
night
with
a
hideously
discordant
and
why
shep
exclaimed
the
farmer
in
amaze
whatever
ails
you
what
s
he
broke
off
in
the
midst
of
his
bewildered
query
and
raised
his
voice
in
a
shout
of
summons
to
the
dog
for
like
a
streak
of
tawny
light
buff
had
whirled
out
of
the
dooryard
and
was
fleeing
up
the
road
he
heard
the
eager
call
of
the
man
who
had
cured
him
and
befriended
him
and
given
him
a
happy
home
but
he
heard
far
more
clearly
a
soundless
call
that
urged
him
forward
guided
only
by
mystic
collie
instinct
and
by
that
weird
impulse
which
had
taken
possession
of
him
he
fled
through
the
night
at
breakneck
speed
headed
unswervingly
for
boone
lake
full
thirty
miles
away
on
the
same
night
after
a
cautious
absence
of
several
months
con
hegan
and
billy
gates
ventured
to
return
to
their
former
homes
in
the
boone
lake
suburbs
chapter
four
the
end
of
the
trail
ruth
hammerton
hurried
into
her
father
s
study
on
her
return
from
the
whither
she
had
fared
for
the
evening
mail
her
dark
face
was
aglow
with
a
colour
that
had
been
foreign
to
it
for
many
a
long
week
a
colour
that
softened
and
mellowed
the
new
lines
of
leanness
and
of
sorrow
in
cheek
and
brow
her
eyes
were
alight
with
nervous
eagerness
hammerton
looked
up
in
surprise
from
a
heap
of
papers
on
his
desk
as
his
daughter
burst
so
unceremoniously
in
upon
him
a
month
earlier
he
had
been
appointed
local
justice
of
the
peace
his
new
duties
still
called
for
much
night
work
in
the
way
of
study
and
preparation
for
the
next
day
s
court
duties
so
it
was
with
a
slight
frown
that
he
greeted
this
sudden
interruption
of
his
labours
i
ve
just
come
from
the
began
ruth
eagerly
as
i
was
coming
out
two
men
almost
bumped
into
me
i
looked
back
as
they
slouched
into
the
store
and
sat
down
by
the
stove
they
had
a
huge
bulldog
at
their
heels
i
heard
one
of
the
loafers
there
hail
them
by
name
they
were
con
hegan
and
billy
gates
a
boy
told
me
they
had
come
back
to
boone
lake
he
said
it
was
their
first
visit
here
since
they
got
out
of
prison
he
pshaw
fumed
hammerton
so
those
two
crooks
are
back
here
are
they
that
means
more
lawlessness
just
as
i
was
congratulating
myself
that
it
was
becoming
a
and
decent
community
at
last
i
wish
you
don
t
understand
broke
in
the
girl
you
don
t
see
what
i
mean
you
don
t
get
the
significance
of
it
and
yet
i
ve
been
all
over
it
with
you
so
often
i
over
what
demanded
hammerton
nettled
by
her
air
of
excited
mystery
please
explain
what
you
re
driving
at
i
m
tremendously
busy
and
michael
trent
was
the
means
of
hegan
and
gates
going
to
prison
she
hurried
on
they
swore
they
would
get
him
for
it
we
have
proof
of
that
the
very
night
after
they
were
set
free
michael
disappeared
and
now
they
are
back
here
again
after
four
months
don
t
you
see
i
see
you
are
trying
to
lure
me
into
that
same
endless
old
argument
again
returned
hammerton
with
a
glance
of
regret
at
his
work
but
really
i
can
t
see
why
these
two
jailbirds
appearance
in
town
should
have
flustered
you
so
there
was
no
foul
play
connected
with
trent
s
disappearance
i
ve
explained
that
to
you
over
and
over
calvin
greer
called
him
up
on
the
telephone
that
evening
trent
told
calvin
he
was
sick
of
boone
lake
and
that
he
was
starting
off
on
a
long
motor
tour
up
country
he
said
if
he
liked
it
up
there
he
d
settle
somewhere
in
the
north
counties
and
never
come
back
next
day
he
and
his
automobile
were
gone
where
is
the
mystery
where
she
repeated
miserably
why
everywhere
the
whole
thing
is
a
mystery
in
the
first
place
i
rode
over
to
see
calvin
greer
at
his
stock
farm
he
had
never
met
michael
till
that
day
and
he
wasn
t
at
all
familiar
with
michael
s
voice
but
he
told
me
it
sounded
rougher
and
hoarser
over
the
phone
than
when
he
talked
to
him
face
to
face
and
he
that
s
no
proof
many
people
s
voices
sound
altogether
different
over
the
phone
or
trent
may
have
had
a
cold
there
s
no
mystery
about
it
i
tell
you
most
assuredly
there
s
nothing
to
connect
hegan
and
gates
with
the
affair
as
to
you
knew
michael
she
went
on
you
knew
him
well
and
you
liked
him
tell
me
was
he
the
sort
of
man
to
go
away
like
that
and
not
have
the
courtesy
to
say
to
us
was
he
he
stopped
here
he
and
buff
you
remember
on
his
way
home
from
the
market
square
that
evening
he
sat
and
chatted
with
us
for
half
an
hour
or
so
he
didn
t
say
a
word
about
going
away
instead
he
arranged
to
go
horseback
riding
with
me
the
next
day
yet
less
than
half
an
hour
later
apparently
he
tells
calvin
greer
he
s
leaving
boone
lake
perhaps
forever
is
that
men
do
queer
things
said
hammerton
turning
back
to
his
papers
i
can
t
agree
with
you
that
there
s
any
mystery
about
it
daughter
certainly
no
mystery
that
would
justify
the
law
in
suspecting
you
know
what
care
he
took
of
his
livestock
pursued
ruth
is
it
likely
is
it
possible
that
he
would
have
left
his
sheep
and
cattle
to
starve
his
cows
unmilked
and
his
horses
with
empty
mangers
would
he
have
gone
away
like
that
of
his
own
accord
and
let
all
his
livestock
starve
to
death
for
they
would
have
starved
to
death
out
there
on
that
solitary
farm
if
you
and
i
hadn
t
gone
to
get
them
and
bring
them
that
s
the
only
part
of
the
whole
thing
that
i
can
t
understand
assented
hammerton
he
treated
his
livestock
as
other
people
treat
their
pets
it
wasn
t
like
him
to
leave
them
to
starve
out
there
they
might
have
gone
hungry
till
they
died
before
any
neighbour
would
have
been
likely
to
happen
in
and
find
them
even
if
he
hadn
t
been
so
fond
of
them
it
doesn
t
make
sense
for
a
man
to
leave
such
valuable
property
to
die
of
neglect
to
say
nothing
of
the
ruin
of
his
year
s
crops
through
his
absence
why
if
you
hadn
t
wheedled
me
into
having
his
crops
looked
after
the
year
would
have
been
a
total
loss
to
his
farm
as
it
is
then
she
declared
triumphantly
since
you
admit
he
wouldn
t
have
done
such
a
thing
of
his
own
accord
i
don
t
admit
it
i
only
say
i
can
t
understand
it
but
it
happened
we
have
proof
of
that
he
went
away
in
his
car
and
he
took
buff
along
with
him
if
he
had
left
buff
there
i
could
have
seen
perhaps
where
the
mystery
came
in
for
he
and
that
collie
were
chums
but
he
took
buff
with
him
and
he
took
along
everything
of
portable
value
in
his
house
too
no
that
doesn
t
look
like
foul
play
he
did
it
deliberately
whatever
his
motive
may
have
been
took
along
his
dog
and
his
valuables
and
drove
away
in
his
own
car
the
car
couldn
t
have
been
stolen
either
for
he
told
greer
over
the
phone
if
it
was
michael
who
told
we
don
t
know
his
motive
summed
up
hammerton
but
we
do
know
he
went
of
his
own
accord
there
is
ample
proof
of
that
as
for
connecting
gates
and
hegan
with
he
did
not
go
of
his
own
accord
announced
the
girl
deathly
white
her
eyes
ablaze
as
she
towered
over
her
wondering
father
and
i
have
every
reason
to
know
he
didn
t
i
don
t
want
to
tell
why
i
know
it
but
i
must
if
i
want
you
to
get
the
truth
out
of
those
two
assassins
i
know
michael
trent
did
not
leave
here
of
his
own
accord
i
know
it
because
he
loved
me
a
man
doesn
t
run
away
like
that
from
what
shouted
hammerton
in
astonishment
he
you
say
he
i
say
he
loved
me
reiterated
the
girl
her
sweet
voice
held
steady
by
a
great
effort
and
no
man
will
go
away
willingly
from
a
woman
he
loves
as
michael
loved
me
most
of
all
he
won
t
go
away
and
fail
to
send
any
kind
of
you
never
told
me
accused
her
father
indignantly
you
never
michael
never
told
me
she
retorted
then
how
he
never
told
me
in
so
many
words
she
went
on
yet
i
knew
it
a
woman
always
knows
he
loved
me
and
he
was
waiting
until
he
could
put
his
farm
on
a
better
paying
basis
before
he
told
me
of
it
now
perhaps
you
ll
believe
me
when
i
say
he
d
never
have
gone
away
like
that
unless
he
had
been
kidnapped
or
long
and
silently
hammerton
stared
at
his
daughter
dazed
by
the
revelation
then
he
said
hesitantly
if
i
d
known
if
you
had
told
me
but
but
now
that
you
do
know
she
persisted
you
ll
get
the
truth
from
hegan
and
gates
you
ll
start
the
machinery
of
the
law
to
working
and
dear
he
said
gently
there
s
nothing
i
can
do
there
is
no
shadow
of
proof
that
either
of
those
men
was
concerned
in
as
you
choose
she
exclaimed
turning
to
leave
the
room
since
you
won
t
interrogate
them
i
am
going
to
i
m
going
back
to
the
to
find
them
if
they
aren
t
there
i
m
going
to
find
where
they
live
and
go
are
you
crazy
stormed
hammerton
jumping
up
to
bar
her
way
you
surely
can
t
mean
to
do
an
insane
thing
like
that
i
won
t
permit
it
then
interrogate
them
yourself
as
a
magistrate
of
this
county
she
bade
him
because
if
you
don
t
do
it
i
shall
if
it
is
insane
let
it
be
insane
in
these
past
months
i
have
had
enough
to
drive
a
wiser
woman
insane
i
love
michael
trent
i
him
i
tell
you
and
if
he
is
on
earth
i
shall
find
him
now
that
i
have
a
hammerton
stared
wonderingly
down
upon
his
wontedly
placid
daughter
then
he
caught
her
into
his
arms
and
held
her
close
to
his
heart
for
a
moment
releasing
her
he
crossed
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
roy
saunders
the
boone
lake
chief
of
police
saunders
he
queried
then
judge
hammerton
speaking
hegan
and
gates
are
in
town
again
i
want
a
talk
with
them
you
ll
find
them
at
the
will
you
bring
them
up
here
to
my
study
as
soon
as
you
can
please
no
there
s
no
warrant
out
for
them
but
i
don
t
think
they
ll
be
fools
enough
to
refuse
to
come
here
he
set
down
the
telephone
and
passed
his
arm
again
round
the
girl
ruth
her
giving
way
wept
convulsively
on
his
breast
there
there
hammerton
murmured
try
to
get
hold
of
yourself
darling
they
ll
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
and
our
one
chance
is
to
keep
cool
i
i
haven
t
much
faith
in
our
success
with
them
it
s
only
fair
to
tell
you
that
ruth
and
i
ve
no
legal
right
to
question
them
at
all
i
m
doing
it
to
save
you
from
doing
it
try
to
be
brave
if
nothing
comes
of
our
talk
with
airily
not
to
say
jauntily
con
hegan
and
billy
gates
strolled
up
the
village
street
and
into
the
highroad
leading
to
the
hammerton
place
to
one
side
of
the
unconcerned
pair
strode
saunders
the
truculent
but
puzzled
chief
of
police
the
men
had
grinned
mirthfully
at
saunders
command
that
they
accompany
him
to
the
magistrate
s
home
they
had
complied
without
a
single
demur
and
they
lightened
the
tedium
of
the
walk
by
guying
the
pompous
police
chief
in
a
way
that
reduced
him
to
sullen
homicidal
yearnings
marshalled
by
saunders
they
lounged
through
the
doorway
in
the
wake
of
a
servant
and
were
ushered
into
hammerton
s
study
at
the
extreme
rear
of
the
house
they
found
hammerton
seated
at
his
desk
looking
very
magisterial
indeed
at
a
far
end
of
the
room
her
face
in
the
shadows
sat
ruth
here
they
are
your
honour
proclaimed
the
chief
of
police
ranging
his
two
grinning
charges
side
by
side
in
front
of
the
desk
yep
cheerily
assented
hegan
here
we
are
judge
we
was
planning
to
bolt
but
this
vigilant
chief
kind
of
overawed
us
we
was
afraid
he
might
cry
if
we
stood
him
on
his
head
and
lit
or
supplemented
gates
he
d
maybe
have
hit
one
of
us
a
crool
slap
on
the
wrist
as
we
run
past
him
or
he
might
go
to
where
we
live
and
bust
one
of
our
umbrellas
to
punish
us
so
we
the
judge
looks
pretty
near
as
terrifyin
as
the
chief
confided
hegan
to
his
companion
in
a
loud
whisper
and
shaking
with
simulated
awe
most
likely
he
keeps
a
lectric
chair
in
his
kitchen
we
d
best
be
p
lite
to
hammerton
checked
an
angry
forward
movement
on
the
part
of
saunders
and
addressed
the
grinning
prisoners
i
have
no
legal
right
to
enforce
replies
to
the
questions
i
am
going
to
ask
you
he
said
quietly
but
it
is
only
fair
to
tell
you
what
rights
i
do
possess
it
is
within
my
jurisdiction
to
commit
you
both
here
and
now
for
vagrancy
since
you
have
no
visible
means
of
support
in
this
village
and
before
the
vagrancy
term
can
expire
there
will
be
some
new
charge
so
to
avoid
these
annoyances
i
advise
you
to
wipe
those
grins
off
your
faces
and
to
drop
the
attempt
to
insult
anyone
here
and
to
answer
the
questions
i
shall
put
to
you
otherwise
you
will
leave
here
with
handcuffs
on
and
will
proceed
to
the
thence
to
come
before
me
in
the
morning
on
a
vagrancy
the
men
looked
at
each
other
uncertainly
gates
seemed
to
be
measuring
the
distance
to
the
study
door
unobtrusively
hammerton
took
a
pistol
from
the
drawer
of
his
desk
and
laid
it
in
his
lap
instantly
the
two
men
stiffened
and
lost
their
jauntily
insolent
manner
there
s
no
call
to
threaten
us
judge
said
hegan
nervously
we
re
glad
to
answer
any
questions

care
to
spring
on
us
as
for
vagrancy
well
we
re
no
vags
we
just
got
home
and
of
course
we
haven
t
had
time
to
look
round
us
for
any
steady
work
yet
but
you
were
let
out
of
logan
prison
on
the
of
last
july
interposed
hammerton
where
did
you
go
from
there
i
mean
as
soon
as
you
were
let
we
went
straight
to
paterson
returned
hegan
we
got
out
of
logan
at
ten
on
the
morning
of
the
we
took
the
noon
train
to
paterson
we
got
work
there
and
we
stayed
on
the
job
till
yesterday
when
the
works
shut
down
for
the
winter
then
we
come
back
you
hadn
t
been
here
since
you
were
sent
to
prison
not
till
we
got
here
this
morning
from
paterson
no
h
m
you
were
not
here
on
the
of
july
you
are
certain
of
that
certain
sure
judge
declared
gates
we
wouldn
t
be
likely
to
forget
if
we
had
this
is
our
home
town
we
was
kind
of
ashamed
to
come
back
right
off
after
they
turned
us
loose
from
the
hoosgow
so
we
you
have
not
been
in
or
near
boone
lake
since
you
were
released
from
prison
until
insisted
hammerton
no
your
honour
we
ain
t
and
we
c
n
prove
it
we
went
straight
to
paterson
and
there
we
then
spoke
up
ruth
coming
forward
how
did
two
reputable
witnesses
happen
to
see
you
at
michael
trent
s
farm
late
on
the
afternoon
of
july
hegan
gulped
gates
however
answered
suavely
flash
your
witnesses
on
us
ma
am
if
they
seen
us
here
or
in
this
county
that
day
they
sure
got
good
eyes
they
yep
supplemented
hegan
who
s
your
witnesses
who
are
they
hammerton
and
saunders
were
looking
at
the
troubled
girl
in
surprise
with
true
feminine
quibble
for
truth
she
had
put
the
statement
in
the
form
of
a
query
in
speaking
of
the
witnesses
whose
identity
she
had
just
invented
the
failure
of
her
ruse
distressed
her
keenly
even
while
the
memory
of
hegan
s
start
and
his
scared
gulp
made
her
doubly
certain
she
was
on
the
right
track
guess
you
never
took
a
course
of
poker
playing
at
school
ma
am
chuckled
gates
reading
her
face
with
all
the
trained
skill
of
a
true
panhandler
shut
up
you
grunted
saunders
in
wrath
he
glowered
upon
the
suave
gates
who
promptly
turned
his
respectful
gaze
to
the
magistrate
s
face
hammerton
frowning
perplexedly
opened
his
lips
for
further
query
even
while
he
realised
the
utter
uselessness
of
trying
to
catch
such
skilled
offenders
by
any
questions
he
might
have
the
wit
to
frame
before
he
could
speak
a
maid
rushed
wildly
into
the
room
with
a
manifest
effort
she
came
to
a
halt
inside
the
doorway
and
stood
as
though
trying
to
announce
some
guest
but
the
guest
himself
entered
the
room
close
at
her
heels
steadily
through
the
gathering
darkness
buff
had
run
his
first
mad
pace
settling
down
into
the
choppy
little
stride
of
the
trotting
wolf
pack
and
so
he
kept
on
ever
headed
for
boone
lake
moving
swervelessly
and
with
deceptive
quickness
stars
came
out
a
fat
moon
began
to
butt
its
way
up
over
the
eastern
horizon
mists
here
and
there
as
the
of
the
collie
s
tireless
feet
pattered
along
the
frozen
road
a
farm
dog
would
bark
challenge
or
dart
out
in
pursuit
but
no
challenge
bark
checked
buff
s
obsessed
flight
nor
did
any
of
the
pursuing
curs
catch
up
with
him
now
and
then
along
the
state
road
motor
cars
would
meet
or
pass
him
the
dog
moved
aside
barely
far
enough
to
miss
the
whirring
wheels
but
did
not
falter
in
his
run
once
as
he
padded
through
a
village
some
fool
catching
sight
of
him
noted
his
tense
pose
and
the
straightness
of
his
course
and
raised
the
shout
of
mad
dog
this
asinine
cry
lurks
ever
in
the
back
of
the
human
throat
ready
and
eager
to
spring
into
life
at
the
slightest
provocation
and
woe
to
the
harmlessly
running
or
perhaps
sick
dog
at
whom
it
is
howled
at
once
the
is
ready
to
start
in
murderous
pursuit
no
question
is
asked
nobody
stops
to
realise
that
there
are
probably
not
two
actually
rabid
dogs
in
any
one
state
in
the
union
in
the
course
of
any
two
years
and
that
a
genuinely
hydrophobic
dog
is
no
more
in
condition
to
chase
and
attack
people
than
is
a
typhoid
patient
but
in
buff
s
case
the
shout
was
raised
too
late
the
shape
sped
on
through
the
dim
moonlight
and
out
of
sight
before
the
was
fairly
up
and
he
did
not
so
much
as
glance
back
to
note
the
progress
of
the
useless
pursuit
as
he
turned
off
the
state
road
taking
the
macadam
byway
which
led
towards
trent
s
farm
the
collie
dropped
to
a
wavering
halt
his
sensitive
nostrils
pulsing
a
scent
had
come
to
him
though
it
was
still
too
elusive
to
register
clearly
in
the
eager
brain
twenty
doubtful
steps
buff
took
along
the
byway
until
he
came
to
a
point
where
a
field
path
from
a
a
mile
away
intersected
it
at
the
intersection
the
scent
struck
him
with
a
force
that
dizzied
him
nostrils
to
earth
he
found
that
a
man
had
left
this
path
for
the
byroad
not
ten
minutes
earlier
the
knowledge
did
amazing
things
to
the
dog
for
an
instant
he
shivered
as
though
with
a
physical
convulsion
his
breath
came
in
long
gasps
a
whine
in
his
throat
shook
itself
forth
in
an
eerie
note
that
belonged
to
no
normal
beast
then
like
a
whirlwind
he
was
off
down
the
byway
nose
to
earth
body
flat
and
flying
half
a
mile
farther
on
the
rush
of
his
madly
scampering
feet
came
to
the
ears
of
a
man
who
was
plodding
wearily
toward
the
farm
a
man
thin
and
shabby
who
walked
as
though
completing
an
exhausting
journey
in
the
middle
of
the
road
the
man
paused
and
glanced
back
adown
the
moonlit
byway
was
dashing
a
creature
flat
to
earth
in
its
speed
fifty
yards
from
the
man
buff
lifted
his
head
as
he
galloped
the
scent
any
dog
s
strongest
quality
told
him
he
might
now
rely
on
sight
which
is
the
weakest
of
a
dog
s
senses
at
what
he
saw
the
collie
gave
tongue
not
in
the
hideous
wolf
howl
or
in
whimper
did
buff
speak
now
but
in
a
cry
that
was
human
and
rending
a
cry
that
tore
at
the
listener
s
heartstrings
by
reason
of
its
awful
intensity
delirious
screaming
writhing
panting
buff
flung
himself
on
the
man
he
had
tracked
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
trail
and
what
he
found
there
drove
him
quite
insane
up
into
michael
trent
s
dusty
arms
the
dog
sprang
a
vibrant
mass
of
mad
ecstasy
moaning
crying
sobbing
like
a
human
child
buff
sought
to
lick
his
master
s
haggard
face
and
to
pat
him
in
a
hundred
places
at
once
with
the
whirling
paws
almost
thrown
off
his
balance
by
the
impact
trent
spoke
to
the
collie
in
wondering
delight
and
the
sound
of
the
tired
voice
sent
buff
into
a
new
frenzy
of
rapture
dropping
to
earth
he
whizzed
round
and
round
trent
in
a
bewildering
gyroscopic
flight
stomach
to
ground
tongue
and
throat
clamorous
with
hoarse
joy
presently
flinging
himself
at
his
master
s
feet
the
dog
lay
there
moaning
and
sobbing
his
swift
tongue
caressing
the
man
s
dusty
shoes
his
furry
body
quivering
from
nose
to
tail
in
hysterical
bliss
there
he
lay
while
trent
leaned
over
and
laid
both
calloused
hands
on
his
head
stroking
him
and
talking
to
him
in
the
pleasant
slow
tones
the
collie
loved
buff
muttered
the
man
swallowing
hard
why
i
didn
t
think
anyone
on
earth
cared
that
much
about
anything
come
up
here
old
friend
you
re
shaking
as
if
you
had
ague
how
did
you
find
me
have
you
been
waiting
at
home
for
me
ever
since
or
have
you
been
living
with
with
her
buff
his
paroxysm
spent
crouched
at
trent
s
feet
his
silken
head
pressed
against
his
master
s
knee
his
upraised
eyes
scanning
the
man
s
face
in
adoration
from
time
to
time
he
shivered
and
moaned
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
trail
the
gloriously
happy
end
of
the
horrible
long
trail
and
he
understood
now
why
his
queer
sixth
sense
had
summoned
him
hither
from
the
farm
where
for
weeks
he
had
lived
so
placidly
the
had
come
to
him
he
had
obeyed
it
for
it
had
been
stronger
than
he
and
it
had
led
him
to
his
god
that
was
all
buff
knew
or
cared
to
know
and
now
still
talking
to
his
dog
still
petting
him
michael
trent
took
up
again
his
homeward
trudge
but
there
was
life
in
his
step
fatigue
seemed
to
have
fallen
away
from
him
the
ludicrous
worship
of
a
dog
had
somehow
made
life
over
and
had
changed
depression
to
hope
following
his
old
custom
immemorial
among
lonely
men
who
own
dogs
trent
talked
to
buff
as
they
went
along
as
though
to
another
human
knowing
the
collie
could
not
get
the
sense
of
one
word
in
ten
yet
glad
to
have
this
vent
for
his
own
yearning
for
expression
the
start
of
it
all
is
pretty
hazy
to
me
buff
he
rambled
on
in
the
soft
monotone
that
was
music
to
the
dog
i
saw
hegan
and
gates
in
the
doorway
one
minute
i
was
fighting
with
them
the
next
minute
i
was
in
the
smelly
fo
cas
le
of
a
tramp
steamship
i
was
sick
and
i
was
aching
all
over
i
had
been
shanghaied
the
next
three
months
were
unadulterated
hell
we
were
bound
for
honolulu
by
way
of
the
horn
buff
and
the
crew
was
only
one
degree
better
than
the
captain
and
the
mate
let
s
let
it
go
at
that
a
chap
named
carney
and
i
got
to
be
pals
we
broke
ship
together
at
san
francisco
on
the
way
back
and
we
made
most
of
the
transcontinental
trip
on
brake
beams
brake
beams
aren
t
flowery
beds
of
ease
buff
keep
off
them
carney
had
got
a
bit
of
the
story
about
me
from
a
man
who
was
the
mate
s
pal
between
voyages
it
seems
a
fellow
who
was
in
prison
down
at
logan
with
gates
and
hegan
helped
them
engineer
my
shanghaiing
he
told
them
where
to
take
me
and
they
loaded
me
on
a
launch
of
his
down
the
river
to
the
harbour
and
sold
me
to
the
captain
he
was
just
weighing
anchor
and
he
was
hegan
and
gates
were
planning
to
keep
me
out
of
the
way
and
to
let
my
stock
starve
and
my
crops
go
to
wrack
as
most
likely
they
have
for
nobody
was
likely
to
get
to
our
farm
in
time
to
prevent
it
then
they
were
going
to
lay
low
for
a
few
months
and
after
that
they
were
coming
back
to
boone
lake
and
set
fire
to
the
house
and
barns
most
likely
they
ve
done
it
before
now
nice
hey
buff
we
re
dead
broke
most
likely
you
and
i
but
we
ve
got
each
other
anyhow
and
that
s
more
than
i
dared
hope
he
was
turning
in
at
the
gateway
of
his
farm
as
he
finished
the
rambling
tale
buff
thrust
his
nose
into
his
master
s
hand
and
whined
softly
then
in
a
trice
the
collie
had
stiffened
to
attention
and
darted
forward
through
the
shadows
towards
a
patch
of
white
that
emerged
from
the
darkness
of
the
dooryard
when
gates
and
hegan
came
home
to
boone
lake
that
day
they
brought
with
them
a
new
possession
in
the
shape
of
a
mongrel
bulldog
of
huge
proportions
and
with
a
local
fame
for
being
one
of
the
dirtiest
fighters
that
ever
set
upon
a
weaker
foe
planning
to
carry
out
their
amiable
intent
of
firing
trent
s
house
and
barns
late
in
the
night
they
had
stationed
this
dog
in
their
victim
s
dooryard
that
evening
to
scare
off
any
possible
tramp
or
other
intruder
who
might
be
intending
to
make
the
deserted
house
a
resting
place
they
had
no
desire
for
such
witnesses
the
penalty
for
arson
being
somewhat
drastic
in
their
home
state
it
was
this
guardian
dog
that
came
tearing
forward
now
to
repel
the
two
intruders
as
trent
and
buff
turned
into
the
dooryard
buff
guessing
his
ferocious
intent
and
resenting
another
and
hostile
dog
s
presence
in
his
own
beloved
bailiwick
flew
eagerly
to
meet
him
an
instant
later
the
two
beasts
came
together
with
a
clash
and
a
right
energetic
dog
fight
was
raging
at
trent
s
feet
buff
for
all
his
fury
fought
with
brain
as
well
as
brawn
against
his
heavier
assailant
there
never
yet
was
a
bulldog
that
could
in
the
open
seize
a
collie
that
was
aware
of
his
assault
and
that
wished
to
elude
it
buff
nimbly
sprang
aside
as
the
bulldog
rushed
and
let
the
other
hurtle
past
him
but
the
bulldog
did
not
go
scatheless
as
he
lumbered
past
a
slash
from
buff
s
curved
eyetooth
ploughed
a
long
and
deep
red
furrow
along
his
shoulder
and
back
and
as
he
turned
buff
s
slash
laid
open
a
similar
cut
at
one
side
of
the
enemy
s
stomach
the
collie
danced
out
of
reach
of
the
clashing
jaws
that
sought
to
grab
him
before
he
could
jump
back
when
the
jaws
clamped
together
the
collie
s
throat
was
not
there
even
as
his
opponent
struck
a
second
time
buff
flung
himself
on
the
ground
and
dived
for
the
heavy
forelegs
in
front
of
him
buff
s
teeth
closed
on
the
bulldog
s
right
foreleg
and
but
for
his
own
strong
strain
of
collie
blood
the
fight
must
have
ended
then
and
there
for
a
bulldog
would
have
gained
this
foreleg
grip
and
would
have
hung
onto
it
heedless
of
the
fact
that
his
own
spine
and
the
back
of
his
neck
were
within
easy
reach
of
the
foe
wherefore
merely
giving
the
forefoot
an
agonising
bite
as
he
went
he
continued
his
diving
rush
under
and
between
the
bowed
forelegs
of
the
bulldog
he
slipped
in
swift
elusiveness
slashing
the
other
s
underbody
again
as
he
went
and
emerged
safe
on
the
far
side
of
the
enemy
back
and
forth
over
the
grass
raged
the
fight
the
frantic
clawing
of
feet
and
buff
s
own
staccato
snarls
and
the
thud
of
clashing
bodies
alone
breaking
the
night
silences
twice
the
bulldog
secured
his
coveted
throat
hold
a
hold
that
must
speedily
have
left
buff
gasping
out
his
life
through
a
severed
jugular
a
third
time
the
bulldog
charged
for
the
throat
buff
reared
twisting
sidewise
to
avoid
the
charge
and
at
the
same
time
to
counter
on
the
panting
and
lumbering
body
but
he
did
not
take
account
of
the
slipperiness
of
the
frosty
dead
grass
the
collie
s
hind
legs
slid
from
under
him
down
he
went
asprawl
on
his
back
under
this
sudden
loss
of
his
precarious
balance
as
quick
as
a
cat
he
had
spun
to
his
feet
again
but
the
instant
of
wasted
time
had
sufficed
for
the
enemy
the
bulldog
lunging
murderously
for
the
exposed
throat
missed
his
mark
by
reason
of
buff
s
swirling
motion
of
scrambling
to
his
feet
again
yet
this
time
the
ravening
jaws
did
not
close
on
air
or
on
fur
instead
they
buried
themselves
in
buff
s
upper
right
foreleg
almost
at
the
junction
of
leg
and
body
helpless
to
break
free
buff
ceased
to
thrash
about
he
felt
the
locked
jaws
begin
to
grind
deep
and
deeper
towards
the
bone
he
felt
his
enemy
s
braced
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
the
imperilled
foreleg
then
his
wolf
brain
told
him
what
to
do
he
struck
straight
for
the
nose
and
upper
jaw
of
the
bulldog
he
did
not
slash
as
does
a
collie
he
bent
down
and
secured
his
grip
as
would
a
bulldog
the
bulldog
his
own
hold
secure
in
the
collie
s
upper
foreleg
was
aware
of
a
terribly
painful
grip
on
his
tender
nose
a
grip
that
waxed
sterner
and
more
tense
all
the
time
a
grip
also
that
was
shutting
off
his
breathing
power
in
the
anguish
of
choking
the
bulldog
let
go
buff
s
foreleg
and
shook
himself
furiously
to
get
free
of
that
encumbering
hold
as
he
shook
he
gave
tone
emitting
a
most
horrendous
yell
of
pain
and
rage
then
for
the
first
time
trent
was
able
in
the
elusive
moonlight
and
shadow
bars
to
see
how
the
fight
was
going
or
to
intervene
without
peril
of
injuring
his
own
dog
but
as
he
bent
down
to
drag
the
squirming
bulldog
away
he
saw
he
was
too
late
buff
s
grinding
jaws
had
found
the
jugular
the
fight
was
over
the
victor
stood
up
panting
and
weary
and
looked
down
at
the
inert
mass
that
had
so
lately
been
a
mighty
fighting
machine
half
an
hour
later
shaved
and
clean
michael
trent
set
forth
for
ruth
hammerton
s
home
buff
wholly
rested
from
his
battle
trotted
happily
at
his
master
s
heels
the
maid
at
hammertons
gaped
wordlessly
at
sight
of
the
visitor
buff
as
politeness
bade
him
wagged
his
tail
and
took
a
step
towards
her
the
maid
by
nature
was
built
for
endurance
rather
than
speed
yet
recovering
from
her
shock
she
jumped
at
least
a
foot
from
the
veranda
floor
and
she
made
a
sound
better
fitted
to
a
turkey
whose
tail
feathers
have
been
grabbed
than
to
a
decorous
household
servant
after
which
she
bolted
into
the
house
and
down
the
hall
towards
the
study
trent
hesitated
as
to
whether
or
not
he
ought
to
follow
but
buff
took
matters
into
his
own
hands
at
the
opening
of
the
front
door
he
caught
the
scent
of
hammerton
s
two
convict
visitors
and
down
the
long
hall
he
went
like
a
thunderbolt
trent
in
consternation
dashed
after
him
but
he
did
not
catch
up
with
the
collie
until
buff
halted
perforce
at
the
doorway
which
the
maid
s
ample
body
was
just
then
blocking
as
he
strove
to
wriggle
past
into
the
room
trent
came
alongside
and
seized
the
inexplicably
excited
dog
firmly
by
the
collar
this
precaution
saved
the
life
of
con
hegan
who
chanced
to
be
standing
nearest
to
the
door
it
was
billy
gates
who
broke
the
brief
spell
even
as
ruth
started
forward
with
a
choking
little
cry
towards
trent
the
convict
s
nerve
and
brain
suddenly
collapsed
waving
a
tremulous
arm
at
the
raging
buff
gates
babbled
in
horror
take
him
away
for
the
lord
s
sake
take
him
away
that
s
no
dog
it
s
a
devil
a
a
ghost
i
i
shot
him
and
i
buried
him
in
a
a
well
with
a
rope
and
a
stone
on
his
neck
take
him
away
he
s
come
back
for
me
at
a
nod
from
hammerton
the
chief
of
police
shoved
hegan
into
an
adjoining
room
then
wheeling
on
the
gibbering
and
helpless
gates
trent
said
sternly
now
talk
the
whole
truth
mind
you
unless
you
want
me
to
let
this
this
ghost
loose
at
you
and
gates
talked
drunk
with
superstitious
horror
he
talked
and
continued
to
talk
even
the
sight
of
hammerton
taking
swift
notes
did
not
deter
him
as
the
chief
of
police
strutted
back
to
the
propelling
his
handcuffed
prisoners
before
him
he
tried
hard
not
to
look
at
a
shaded
corner
of
the
moonlit
veranda
a
corner
wherein
a
maid
and
a
man
were
seated
very
close
together
with
a
big
collie
curled
up
in
drowsy
contentment
at
their
feet
something
a
dog
is
only
a
dog
but
a
collie
is
a
collie
says
the
scotch
proverb
collie
has
the
brain
of
a
man
and
the
ways
of
a
woman
this
is
the
story
of
dick
snowden
s
collie
jock
and
of
something
you
can
believe
the
tale
or
not
as
you
choose
but
if
you
know
collies
you
will
think
twice
before
you
it
as
rankly
impossible
moreover
in
its
chief
and
strangest
happenings
it
chances
to
be
true
it
began
when
dick
snowden
s
pretty
was
lying
in
the
centre
of
a
huge
white
bed
and
when
she
was
watching
the
world
glide
past
her
and
not
much
caring
how
soon
it
might
glide
altogether
away
from
her
cuddled
close
to
her
in
the
enormous
bed
was
a
bundle
of
tiny
humanity
that
smelled
of
talcum
powder
and
of
sachet
and
was
a
week
old
the
coming
of
baby
marise
into
the
ken
of
mankind
had
cost
the
life
of
klyda
snowden
her
there
were
no
complications
there
was
nothing
the
learned
doctors
could
put
a
name
to
but
klyda
had
suffered
much
and
had
been
through
much
she
was
very
very
tired
so
tired
was
she
that
it
did
not
seem
worth
while
to
pick
up
the
bulky
burden
of
life
again
it
was
much
easier
to
lie
still
with
eyes
and
feel
herself
drifting
lazily
out
of
life
dully
she
knew
the
baby
was
hers
that
it
was
the
precious
little
daughter
for
whose
advent
she
and
dick
had
for
months
been
planning
so
happily
she
knew
too
that
the
lean
and
bronzed
man
who
spent
so
many
miserable
hours
at
her
bedside
was
her
worshipped
husband
dick
yes
she
was
quite
sane
but
she
was
so
tired
that
none
of
the
things
in
which
usually
she
revelled
were
worth
living
for
mentally
she
knew
that
the
future
was
bright
for
her
and
for
dick
and
for
their
baby
physically
she
was
not
interested
in
anything
but
drowsing
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
eighth
day
of
baby
marise
s
life
that
dick
came
into
the
room
carrying
a
covered
wicker
basket
klyda
had
no
interest
in
him
or
in
what
he
was
carrying
even
when
he
set
down
the
basket
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
lifted
its
cover
sleepily
she
looked
at
him
ready
to
drop
into
another
doze
into
the
opened
basket
went
dick
snowden
s
hand
to
take
out
the
contents
but
the
contents
saved
him
the
effort
out
from
the
depths
of
the
basket
sprang
a
fluffy
ball
of
dynamic
energy
it
wavered
dizzily
on
the
wicker
edge
then
catapulted
clumsily
to
the
counterpane
where
it
caught
sight
of
klyda
s
colourless
little
face
set
in
a
halo
of
tumbled
sunlit
hair
with
the
awkward
canter
of
a
badly
made
patent
toy
the
ball
of
fluff
danced
sidewise
up
the
counterpane
until
it
reached
the
white
little
face
which
it
proceeded
to
lick
ecstatically
with
a
very
small
and
very
pink
tongue
by
this
time
klyda
s
weary
brain
had
registered
the
fact
that
the
new
arrival
was
a
collie
pup
also
that
it
was
doubtless
the
same
collie
pup
which
dick
had
promised
a
month
ago
to
buy
for
her
the
gift
was
one
on
which
klyda
had
set
her
heart
from
the
day
she
and
her
husband
had
chanced
to
pass
by
some
neighbouring
collie
kennels
and
had
seen
a
litter
of
puppies
playing
with
their
dam
in
one
of
the
wire
runs
instantly
she
had
taken
a
violent
fancy
to
this
particular
pup
it
was
then
too
young
to
leave
its
mother
but
dick
had
secured
the
owner
s
promise
to
sell
it
to
him
as
soon
as
the
youngster
should
be
weaned
the
promise
had
delighted
klyda
she
had
named
the
puppy
jock
and
had
decreed
that
he
should
be
baby
s
guardian
and
chum
yet
since
then
so
many
things
had
happened
and
now
the
arrival
of
the
pup
meant
nothing
to
klyda
at
all
except
that
she
did
not
like
to
have
her
wan
face
licked
nor
to
be
patted
at
by
a
set
of
clumsy
and
shapeless
white
forepaws
she
frowned
slightly
and
hoped
dick
would
take
the
obstreperous
puppy
away
but
at
sight
of
her
frown
the
puppy
evidently
mistook
the
slight
facial
contortion
for
an
invitation
to
play
for
he
braced
himself
on
all
four
shapeless
legs
and
made
threatening
little
rushes
at
the
frowning
face
accenting
his
attacks
with
ferocious
baby
barks
in
spite
of
herself
klyda
felt
a
vague
amusement
at
the
pup
s
silly
antics
she
reached
out
a
weak
white
hand
to
pet
him
at
the
touch
jock
forgot
he
was
a
lion
or
whatever
other
furious
wild
beast
he
was
pretending
to
be
he
remembered
only
that
he
was
very
young
and
very
far
from
home
and
mother
and
that
the
caress
of
the
tired
hand
was
sweet
with
a
cluck
of
contentment
he
cuddled
close
to
klyda
s
face
and
curled
up
for
a
nap
dick
glad
to
have
aroused
his
apathetic
wife
s
interest
to
even
so
mild
an
extent
stooped
to
pick
up
the
puppy
and
carry
him
away
but
jock
was
in
no
hurry
to
go
so
piteously
did
he
look
to
klyda
for
rescue
that
she
bade
her
husband
leave
him
there
for
the
time
whereat
by
way
of
showing
his
thanks
jock
began
again
to
play
with
her
hand
as
it
lay
idle
on
the
quilt
up
to
this
time
everybody
had
moved
on
tiptoe
about
the
and
had
talked
in
undertones
but
jock
was
no
respecter
of
silence
he
gambolled
and
barked
to
his
heart
s
content
partly
amused
and
partly
annoyed
by
his
bumptiousness
klyda
found
herself
for
the
first
time
unable
to
sink
at
will
into
that
dreamy
apathy
of
hers
it
is
hard
to
dream
when
a
tiny
furry
whirlwind
is
charging
at
one
or
is
professing
to
believe
that
one
s
white
fingers
are
a
mortal
foe
to
be
nibbled
and
threatened
thus
it
was
against
her
own
will
that
klyda
snowden
was
shaken
from
her
after
that
youth
and
nature
combined
to
keep
her
from
sinking
back
into
it
probably
she
would
have
gotten
well
anyhow
and
certainly
a
noisy
collie
pup
is
not
to
be
prescribed
as
a
temporary
roommate
for
a
sick
girl
but
the
fact
remained
that
klyda
turned
the
corner
that
very
day
and
forthwith
grew
better
she
had
not
discovered
a
new
zest
in
life
her
husband
and
her
child
furnished
that
but
she
had
been
deprived
of
the
luxury
of
drifting
away
action
and
annoyance
and
clownish
gambols
had
chanced
to
supply
the
needed
impetus
to
bring
her
back
to
normality
yet
dick
and
she
always
attributed
her
rally
to
the
arrival
of
jock
and
they
loved
him
accordingly
instead
of
living
in
the
kennel
in
the
garden
and
seeing
his
owners
for
only
a
casual
hour
or
so
each
day
he
was
brought
up
in
the
house
and
with
hourly
human
companionship
that
sort
of
thing
has
a
queerly
humanising
influence
on
a
dog
especially
if
the
dog
be
a
thoroughbred
collie
from
earliest
puppyhood
jock
learned
to
know
the
human
voice
in
all
its
phases
and
to
read
from
experience
its
many
shades
of
meaning
he
learned
too
from
constant
hearing
the
meanings
of
many
simple
words
and
phrases
he
learned
still
more
of
human
nature
all
of
which
was
wholly
natural
and
has
occurred
to
hundreds
of
collies
from
the
first
jock
adopted
baby
marise
as
his
particular
deity
he
would
lie
for
hours
at
the
foot
of
her
crib
or
would
walk
in
sedate
slowness
at
the
side
of
her
perambulator
in
preference
to
a
woodland
race
or
even
a
romp
with
dick
or
klyda
yet
between
him
and
dick
there
was
a
strange
bond
of
sympathy
dearly
as
the
dog
loved
klyda
and
marise
he
was
closer
to
dick
than
to
either
of
them
he
would
lie
with
his
eyes
on
the
man
s
face
watching
its
every
change
and
seemed
to
be
studying
him
to
the
very
soul
even
as
a
puppy
jock
used
to
do
this
a
scowl
on
dick
s
brow
would
bring
him
forward
with
a
rush
to
offer
canine
sympathy
or
to
rub
his
nose
consolingly
against
his
master
s
hand
he
would
go
into
ecstasies
of
joyous
excitement
when
dick
laughed
or
smiled
and
as
the
dog
grew
older
he
seemed
able
to
see
past
mere
facial
expression
and
to
read
dick
s
varying
moods
even
when
those
moods
gave
no
visible
sign
of
expression
all
of
this
seemed
nothing
short
of
magic
to
the
snowdens
though
it
is
a
common
enough
phenomenon
to
anyone
who
has
been
much
with
collies
it
was
when
baby
marise
was
a
girl
of
four
and
when
jock
was
a
stately
giant
in
his
early
maturity
that
something
happened
which
the
snowdens
never
tired
of
talking
about
dick
started
at
sunrise
for
a
day
s
along
a
brook
which
ran
through
a
wild
tract
of
meadow
and
forest
some
three
miles
above
the
snowden
place
jock
as
his
master
set
forth
galloped
enthusiastically
ahead
eager
for
the
prospective
walk
but
dick
whistled
him
back
the
man
did
not
desire
to
have
wary
trout
scared
away
by
the
occasional
plunges
of
a
collie
into
the
brook
no
he
said
as
if
talking
to
a
not
old
man
stay
here
and
look
after
the
crestfallen
yet
philosophical
jock
trotted
back
to
the
veranda
and
lay
down
his
deep
brown
eyes
following
pathetically
the
receding
figure
of
his
master
hoping
against
hope
that
dick
might
relent
and
summon
him
to
follow
then
marise
came
down
to
breakfast
with
klyda
and
jock
proceeded
to
devote
himself
to
their
society
it
was
about
four
o
clock
that
afternoon
when
klyda
was
awakened
from
a
nap
on
the
porch
by
the
sudden
rising
of
the
collie
from
his
on
the
mat
near
her
jock
had
been
asleep
yet
something
had
startled
him
in
an
instant
from
his
repose
and
had
changed
a
sedately
slumbering
collie
into
a
creature
of
puppylike
excitability
every
hair
on
the
dog
s
shaggy
ruff
was
abristle
his
eyes
were
glinting
as
with
pain
he
burst
into
a
salvo
of
frantic
barking
and
dashed
across
to
where
klyda
lay
catching
the
hem
of
the
astonished
woman
s
skirt
in
his
teeth
he
tugged
at
her
dress
backing
away
with
a
suddenness
that
all
but
threw
her
to
the
floor
jock
expostulated
klyda
recovering
her
balance
and
trying
to
extricate
the
skirt
from
his
grip
jock
have
you
gone
crazy
jock
s
answer
was
to
release
his
hold
on
the
and
to
gallop
off
the
porch
and
out
onto
the
drive
which
led
to
the
highway
there
he
halted
barked
in
imperious
summons
and
darted
back
to
klyda
catching
her
skirt
again
between
his
jaws
he
sought
to
draw
her
out
onto
the
driveway
with
him
laughing
at
her
pet
s
odd
behaviour
klyda
went
down
the
steps
to
the
drive
instantly
jock
let
go
of
her
skirt
and
ran
fifty
feet
towards
the
main
road
there
halting
again
he
turned
and
barked
as
the
woman
still
did
not
follow
he
ran
back
seized
her
skirt
in
his
teeth
again
and
tried
to
draw
her
onward
this
time
klyda
did
not
refuse
to
follow
a
queer
notion
had
possessed
her
a
notion
that
jock
was
not
doing
these
unaccountable
things
for
a
mere
lark
or
to
lure
her
into
a
romp
it
was
not
at
all
like
the
dignified
collie
to
behave
this
way
calling
to
her
brother
who
was
reading
indoors
to
join
her
she
set
forth
in
the
wake
of
the
dog
the
moment
the
two
humans
started
toward
him
jock
ceased
to
bark
in
that
frantic
and
fashion
he
wheeled
and
galloped
off
straight
across
country
every
few
hundred
yards
he
would
pause
to
make
sure
the
others
were
still
following
and
to
let
them
come
nearer
then
he
would
be
off
again
a
wearisome
walk
he
led
the
puzzled
klyda
and
her
grumbling
brother
in
a
precise
line
he
travelled
turning
aside
for
no
hillock
or
rock
or
tangle
of
undergrowth
for
goodness
sake
panted
the
brother
once
as
he
looked
ruefully
down
at
his
buckskin
shoes
which
had
just
plodded
through
a
corner
of
for
goodness
sake
klyda
let
s
stop
this
fool
ramble
the
idiot
of
a
dog
will
probably
halt
in
front
of
some
oak
where
he
s
treed
a
cat
and
he
ll
want
us
to
dislodge
his
quarry
for
him
on
a
day
like
this
what
s
the
earthly
sense
of
following
a
he
hasn
t
treed
a
cat
was
klyda
s
reply
he
hasn
t
treed
anything
he
s
been
with
me
all
day
i
don
t
know
why
he
is
acting
like
this
but
i
know
jock
and
i
know
he
s
got
some
good
reason
for
being
so
eager
for
me
to
follow
him
if
you
re
tired
oh
i
ll
trail
along
if
you
re
going
to
grunted
her
brother
only
if
he
leads
us
over
into
the
next
county
and
then
turns
around
and
leads
us
back
just
for
fun
well
i
warn
you
i
ll
guy
you
for
the
rest
of
your
days
for
being
so
silly
as
to
hello
he
broke
off
here
s
where
we
ll
have
to
wade
they
had
come
out
of
the
woods
at
the
verge
of
a
wide
brook
klyda
gave
a
little
start
as
she
saw
it
and
lost
her
colour
why
this
is
snake
brook
she
cried
dick
and
i
have
been
here
a
dozen
times
but
we
ve
always
come
by
way
of
the
road
i
didn
t
know
it
was
in
this
direction
i
well
queried
her
brother
even
at
that
what
s
the
excitement
there
s
nothing
so
very
dramatic
is
there
in
coming
upon
snake
brook
it
s
it
s
where
dick
came
to
fish
said
klyda
her
pallor
increasing
jock
has
led
us
here
and
and
that
s
the
thrilling
end
of
our
quest
interrupted
her
brother
with
a
growl
of
disgust
jock
got
lonely
for
his
master
and
he
s
dragged
us
through
marsh
and
brambles
all
this
way
just
for
a
sweet
family
reunion
lord
no
contradicted
klyda
her
voice
not
quite
steady
no
see
he
hasn
t
crossed
the
brook
he
s
running
along
it
on
this
side
and
now
he
s
stopped
again
for
us
to
follow
him
come
she
set
off
at
a
run
along
the
pebbly
and
winding
margin
of
the
brook
jock
as
she
started
wheeled
again
and
vanished
into
a
copse
of
shrubbery
which
ran
down
from
a
steep
bank
to
the
edge
of
the
water
ten
seconds
later
the
two
heard
the
collie
s
voice
upraised
once
more
this
time
in
a
quavering
of
anguish
and
no
longer
did
the
undergrowth
crackle
at
his
charging
progress
he
had
come
to
a
halt
somewhere
the
cur
s
stumbled
into
a
hornets
nest
guyed
the
brother
laughing
loudly
to
subdue
a
prickly
feeling
that
ran
along
his
spine
at
sound
of
that
eerie
cry
but
klyda
did
not
answer
she
was
plunging
headlong
through
the
bushes
panting
and
gasping
with
her
own
violent
efforts
to
reach
the
spot
where
jock
awaited
her
out
in
a
little
clearing
beside
the
brook
and
at
the
base
of
a
she
came
upon
the
dog
he
was
standing
guard
over
a
body
that
sprawled
inertly
half
in
the
water
at
the
a
splintered
fishing
rod
at
its
side
there
lay
dick
snowden
his
leg
broken
in
two
places
by
his
tumble
from
the
bank
in
falling
his
head
had
struck
against
a
boulder
the
impact
had
caused
concussion
of
the
brain
nor
did
the
victim
recover
consciousness
until
an
hour
after
they
had
gotten
him
home
people
who
did
not
understand
collies
used
to
smile
politely
and
lift
their
brows
when
the
snowdens
told
how
jock
had
brought
aid
to
the
stricken
master
of
whose
plight
the
dog
could
not
possibly
have
known
through
any
explainable
channels
some
of
these
people
agreed
with
klyda
s
brother
who
always
insisted
there
was
nothing
mysterious
or
occult
about
the
matter
they
explained
that
jock
had
waxed
lonely
for
his
absent
master
and
had
tried
to
coax
klyda
into
going
with
him
to
meet
the
returning
fisherman
and
that
the
accident
to
dick
had
been
a
mere
coincidence
quite
outside
the
dog
s
calculations
they
did
not
explain
how
jock
knew
the
precise
direction
in
which
dick
had
gone
that
day
nor
why
during
snowden
s
previous
and
succeeding
absences
from
home
the
collie
made
no
such
effort
to
follow
him
klyda
and
dick
did
not
bother
to
argue
with
these
sceptics
they
knew
jock
other
people
did
not
it
wasn
t
coincidence
was
all
klyda
would
say
when
outsiders
sought
to
convince
her
it
was
and
so
the
years
went
on
at
the
snowden
home
pleasantly
and
uneventfully
baby
marise
was
a
leggy
and
girl
of
nine
and
jock
was
in
the
full
hale
prime
of
latter
middle
age
dick
and
klyda
were
sweethearts
as
ever
they
and
their
child
and
their
huge
dog
formed
a
close
corporation
that
made
home
life
very
beautiful
for
all
four
of
them
then
over
the
smugly
complacent
land
rang
a
half
the
world
was
sick
unto
death
with
the
hun
pestilence
and
america
alone
could
stay
the
hideous
disease
s
assault
on
humanity
america
alone
could
cure
a
dying
world
to
achieve
this
miracle
the
lives
of
thousands
of
brave
men
were
needed
and
at
the
terrible
blast
of
the
these
men
responded
in
millions
dick
snowden
was
one
of
them
there
were
tears
at
the
snowden
home
when
dick
first
went
thence
to
the
officers
there
was
dire
loneliness
after
he
had
gone
but
there
were
no
tears
when
at
the
end
of
his
last
furlough
captain
richard
snowden
said
to
his
family
and
embarked
for
france
there
were
no
tears
then
there
was
a
on
klyda
s
drawn
lips
baby
marise
tried
to
smile
too
and
at
least
she
did
not
cry
which
was
very
brave
indeed
jock
looked
long
and
gravely
up
into
snowden
s
forcedly
gay
face
and
laid
his
splendid
head
against
his
master
s
khaki
knee
as
dick
said
to
him
old
chap
take
care
of
them
till
i
come
back
you
re
the
man
of
the
house
remember
while
i
m
no
there
were
no
tears
when
captain
dick
snowden
sailed
gallantly
away
to
fight
the
pests
which
were
engulfing
the
world
but
there
was
a
deadly
and
bitter
loneliness
that
swooped
down
on
the
little
household
and
gripped
it
by
the
throat
a
loneliness
that
deepened
and
grew
more
cruelly
hard
to
bear
as
the
dreary
weeks
sagged
on
jock
with
his
queer
collie
sixth
sense
felt
acutely
the
changed
atmosphere
of
the
place
he
sought
in
a
thousand
unobtrusive
ways
to
console
and
cheer
his
mistress
and
marise
and
he
seemed
to
have
understood
dick
s
parting
charge
to
him
to
assume
the
responsibilities
of
the
man
of
the
always
jock
had
been
a
fiery
guardian
of
the
home
in
the
matter
of
warding
off
intruders
nowadays
his
jealous
guardianship
became
an
obsession
voluntarily
abandoning
his
lifelong
nightly
on
the
rug
outside
the
door
of
klyda
s
room
he
took
to
sleeping
on
the
veranda
nor
was
his
sleep
heavy
a
dozen
times
a
night
the
wakeful
klyda
could
hear
the
big
dog
get
to
his
feet
and
start
off
on
a
thorough
patrol
of
the
grounds
this
accomplished
he
would
circle
the
porch
and
return
to
his
doormat
bed
for
another
fitful
snooze
but
the
very
slightest
sound
was
enough
to
awaken
him
and
to
bring
him
at
once
to
fierce
alertness
the
step
of
a
belated
wayfarer
on
the
highroad
beyond
the
faintest
stir
of
one
of
the
sleepers
within
the
house
any
of
a
hundred
negligible
noises
of
the
night
sufficed
to
rouse
him
to
his
duty
in
the
daytime
jock
was
seldom
more
than
arm
from
klyda
or
marise
with
cold
suspicion
his
melancholy
dark
eyes
would
follow
the
motions
of
each
casual
visitor
or
tradesman
yes
jock
was
taking
his
job
seriously
on
the
rare
occasions
when
a
letter
from
france
reached
the
place
he
knew
of
its
arrival
before
the
mail
was
sorted
it
would
thrill
him
and
set
him
to
barking
wildly
and
to
scampering
about
the
house
like
a
puppy
he
seemed
to
know
the
occasion
was
one
of
rapture
for
them
all
the
minute
the
letters
are
handed
in
at
the
door
klyda
boasted
to
her
brother
even
before
any
of
us
have
time
to
look
them
over
jock
always
knows
whether
or
not
there
s
a
letter
from
why
shouldn
t
he
demanded
the
sceptic
a
collie
has
a
wolf
s
power
of
scent
he
can
smell
the
touch
of
dick
s
hand
on
the
envelope
it
s
perfectly
no
denied
klyda
musingly
it
isn
t
normal
it
s
then
late
of
a
september
night
the
household
was
jolted
from
slumber
by
a
clangour
of
barking
from
the
porch
to
one
who
understands
collies
there
is
as
much
difference
in
a
dog
s
various
modes
of
barking
as
in
the
inflections
of
a
human
voice
for
example
there
is
the
gay
bark
of
greeting
there
is
the
sharply
imperative
bark
of
challenge
there
is
the
noisily
swaggering
bark
of
sheer
excitement
and
there
is
the
acute
and
agonised
bark
that
tells
of
stark
emotion
jock
s
bark
had
the
timbre
of
that
with
which
long
ago
he
had
summoned
klyda
to
the
aid
of
her
injured
husband
at
snake
brook
and
the
sound
went
through
the
lonely
wife
s
soul
like
a
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
in
and
slippers
ran
out
to
the
porch
as
on
that
earlier
day
jock
was
awaiting
her
in
fevered
excitement
catching
the
hem
of
her
wrapper
he
tugged
then
dropping
the
wrapper
he
galloped
up
the
driveway
and
wheeled
about
to
face
her
with
a
bark
of
summons
klyda
needed
no
second
invitation
to
follow
him
bewildered
trembling
yet
trusting
to
the
collie
s
intuition
she
stumbled
along
in
the
direction
jock
led
and
leaving
the
driveway
he
was
travelling
due
northeast
well
did
klyda
know
she
was
moving
northeastward
for
by
dint
of
compass
and
maps
she
had
long
since
figured
out
for
herself
the
approximate
direction
of
france
in
relation
to
her
home
and
always
she
faced
in
that
direction
when
she
knelt
to
pray
for
dick
for
perhaps
half
a
mile
the
dog
continued
his
progress
at
first
in
mad
eagerness
but
presently
in
growing
indecision
and
irresolution
at
last
he
stopped
sniffed
the
air
through
vertically
lifted
nostrils
then
trotted
back
to
klyda
head
tail
dragging
every
line
of
his
grand
body
expressing
the
utmost
miserable
dejection
he
crept
up
to
klyda
and
crouched
before
her
his
head
on
her
foot
he
shuddered
as
if
in
pain
and
then
whimpered
softly
lifting
his
head
for
a
moment
and
peering
to
the
northeast
he
had
failed
he
had
awakened
with
the
sudden
knowledge
of
his
master
s
peril
he
had
followed
the
urge
of
the
call
and
all
at
once
he
had
realised
that
for
some
reason
he
could
not
hope
to
lead
his
mistress
to
the
man
who
so
sorely
needed
her
aid
perplexed
heartsick
he
had
crawled
back
helpless
to
do
more
again
klyda
s
brother
scoffed
at
his
sister
s
certainty
that
something
was
amiss
with
snowden
so
did
all
others
to
whom
the
unhappy
woman
told
the
tale
they
still
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
any
premonition
on
the
part
of
the
dog
but
there
was
an
awed
note
behind
their
scoffing
when
a
few
weeks
later
a
shaky
scrawl
was
received
from
the
absentee
a
scrawl
written
in
a
base
hospital
i
am
laid
by
the
heels
for
a
day
or
two
by
a
handful
of
rather
nasty
little
that
herr
fritz
sprayed
me
with
three
nights
ago
during
a
reconnoitre
nothing
serious
so
you
re
not
to
worry
your
dear
self
i
ll
be
as
good
as
new
in
a
week
or
two
the
surgeon
says
so
he
says
i
ll
be
lucky
if
i
m
able
to
claim
a
on
the
strength
of
such
a
piker
injury
here
is
a
funny
bit
of
mental
delusion
that
may
amuse
you
when
i
toppled
over
and
lay
there
in
no
man
s
land
before
my
men
could
find
me
and
bring
me
in
there
was
an
ungodly
lot
of
racket
from
the
hun
batteries
it
almost
deafened
me
but
through
it
all
i
believed
i
could
hear
as
distinctly
as
ever
i
heard
anything
the
wild
barking
of
old
jock
wasn
t
that
a
quaint
trick
for
a
wounded
man
s
brain
to
play
jock
has
a
pretty
thunderous
bark
but
its
echo
could
hardly
travel
three
thousand
miles
and
reach
me
above
the
roar
of
the
boche
batteries
yet
i
heard
it
it
wasn
t
his
usual
bark
either
it
sounded
the
way
it
did
the
time
marise
fell
down
the
well
and
as
it
sounded
when
the
house
caught
fire
in
the
night
and
he
roused
us
barely
in
time
to
put
out
the
blaze
i
must
have
been
a
bit
delirious
of
course
but
it
gave
me
a
queer
homey
feeling
to
hear
the
dear
old
fellow
s
voice
even
if
i
didn
t
hear
klyda
looked
at
the
date
on
the
letter
then
she
subtracted
three
days
therefrom
and
computed
the
time
difference
between
her
home
and
northern
france
then
she
turned
to
the
little
on
which
superstitiously
she
had
marked
with
a
cross
the
date
of
her
awakening
by
jock
after
that
she
showed
her
brother
the
letter
and
the
calendar
as
i
have
said
he
still
scoffed
but
there
was
something
of
awe
in
his
manner
it
was
a
shock
to
klyda
to
know
her
adored
soldier
was
wounded
yet
it
was
also
a
joy
to
know
that
he
was
not
only
in
no
danger
from
his
wound
but
that
he
was
kept
perforce
out
of
battle
for
a
time
this
knowledge
and
the
relief
from
her
weeks
of
foreboding
gave
klyda
a
curious
sense
of
peace
which
had
not
been
hers
in
many
a
day
her
spirits
rebounded
to
a
lightness
which
was
almost
hysterical
as
the
day
wore
on
her
unnatural
gaiety
and
her
sense
of
nearness
to
dick
increased
early
in
the
evening
she
left
the
house
and
strolled
out
into
the
white
autumn
moonlight
she
was
restless
and
she
wanted
solitude
and
exercise
jock
rose
from
his
bed
on
the
doormat
and
ranged
alongside
her
for
the
anticipated
walk
crossing
the
stretch
of
turf
the
two
made
their
way
towards
a
rustic
that
stood
on
a
knoll
at
the
far
end
of
the
grounds
here
with
dick
they
had
been
wont
to
sit
daily
to
watch
the
sunset
and
to
the
old
klyda
now
strolled
jock
like
herself
had
been
gay
all
day
ever
since
the
arrival
of
the
pencil
scrawl
from
dick
it
was
with
difficulty
now
that
he
curbed
his
exuberant
pace
to
keep
time
with
hers
they
reached
the
on
the
knoll
there
klyda
stood
for
an
instant
in
silence
to
gaze
dreamily
over
the
hills
the
night
was
deathly
still
then
of
a
sudden
the
silences
were
shattered
by
a
sound
that
wailed
forth
in
hideous
cadences
from
hill
to
hill
until
the
placid
night
fairly
screamed
with
it
klyda
gasped
aloud
at
the
horror
of
the
plangent
din
and
she
spun
about
to
locate
its
cause
there
in
the
moonlight
twenty
feet
away
from
her
stood
jock
the
dog
s
every
muscle
was
tense
as
if
with
torture
his
head
was
flung
back
from
his
cavernous
throat
was
issuing
a
series
of
howls
slow
earsplitting
raucous
howls
of
mortal
anguish
jock
panted
klyda
in
swift
terror
at
the
same
moment
in
a
base
hospital
near
a
nurse
was
drawing
the
top
of
a
cotton
sheet
over
a
face
whose
eyes
would
no
longer
need
the
light
of
day
the
nurse
was
saying
to
a
as
she
performed
the
grim
duty
poor
fellow
he
was
doing
so
nicely
too
till
the
blood
poison
set
in
say
nora
did
i
hear
a
dog
howling
just
then
or
are
my
nerves
going
bad
at
the
quick
appeal
in
klyda
s
voice
jock
ceased
his
hideous
lament
and
stood
trembling
with
head
bent
almost
to
the
ground
then
through
her
moment
of
dread
that
same
strange
sense
of
nearness
to
her
husband
came
back
upon
the
woman
but
fiftyfold
stronger
than
ever
before
since
his
departure
through
no
volition
of
her
own
she
heard
herself
whisper
timidly
as
she
spoke
the
collie
raised
his
head
as
in
joyous
greeting
he
came
swiftly
over
to
where
his
mistress
stood
but
it
was
not
towards
her
he
was
moving
nor
was
it
at
her
that
his
rapturously
welcoming
gaze
was
turned
the
dog
was
hurrying
with
eyes
aglint
and
plumy
tail
waving
toward
a
spot
directly
beside
her
thus
had
he
advanced
many
a
time
to
greet
his
master
when
dick
had
returned
from
brief
absences
and
when
jock
had
seen
him
standing
there
with
his
arm
thrown
protectingly
about
his
wife
and
his
eyes
smiling
down
into
hers
to
humans
the
tensely
waiting
woman
would
have
seemed
to
be
standing
there
in
the
moonlight
alone
but
it
was
not
into
empty
space
that
the
advancing
dog
gazed
so
eagerly
no
one
seeing
the
collie
then
could
have
doubted
for
an
instant
that
jock
was
looking
at
chums
arnon
flint
had
not
volunteered
to
take
the
to
the
bank
indeed
he
had
tried
hard
to
crawl
out
of
the
errand
a
with
a
swim
to
follow
had
beckoned
right
alluringly
to
him
there
was
no
fun
in
missing
all
this
and
taking
a
hot
into
town
just
for
the
honour
of
acting
as
bearer
to
the
bank
of
the
church
bazaar
s
satchelful
of
change
and
small
bills
arnon
said
so
with
engaging
frankness
at
lunch
that
noon
when
his
mother
told
him
of
the
task
that
had
been
deputed
to
him
whereat
his
father
looked
up
gloweringy
from
his
task
of
and
added
his
quota
to
the
argument
as
long
as
you
eat
my
bread
you
ll
obey
my
orders
and
your
mother
s
too
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
grumbling
you
ll
take
that
money
to
the
bank
and
you
ll
get
a
receipt
for
it
and
you
ll
look
sharp
to
get
there
before
three
too
let
it
go
at
that
for
perhaps
thirty
seconds
arnon
wisely
let
it
go
at
then
human
endurance
broke
down
before
equally
human
indignation
you
talk
a
lot
about
my
eating
your
bread
sniffed
the
boy
but
it
isn
t
my
fault
i
eat
it
if
you
d
let
me
take
a
job
instead
of
making
me
get
ready
to
go
to
that
measly
old
college
i
d
have
been
eating
my
own
bread
by
this
you
d
be
wasting
another
man
s
time
and
money
instead
of
mine
retorted
his
father
and
you
d
be
back
on
my
hands
inside
of
a
week
no
thanks
you
re
going
to
college
if
ever
you
have
sense
enough
to
pass
your
entrance
exams
college
may
make
a
man
of
you
nothing
else
will
in
the
meantime
you
ll
do
something
for
your
keep
besides
sulking
for
instance
you
ll
take
the
bazaar
s
dollars
to
the
bank
this
afternoon
and
you
ll
do
it
without
any
more
as
he
stood
jammed
with
eight
other
people
upon
the
interurban
s
back
platform
that
afternoon
arnon
morosely
went
over
in
his
mind
this
dialogue
he
fell
to
chewing
on
the
unpalatable
mess
of
grievances
that
had
led
up
to
the
scene
and
he
was
hot
and
sick
with
resentment
some
conscienceless
liar
once
said
that
schooldays
are
the
happiest
time
in
life
that
same
liar
would
make
ananias
or
munchausen
look
like
the
original
truthful
james
in
many
ways
the
of
a
growing
boy
are
worse
than
a
term
in
prison
they
are
perhaps
a
delight
to
the
model
youth
but
to
the
average
lad
they
hold
more
torture
than
any
grown
man
could
endure
it
is
only
the
miraculous
elastic
power
of
youth
that
makes
them
bearable
it
is
the
distorting
and
falsifying
magic
of
retrospect
that
gives
them
their
only
charm
a
grown
man
let
us
say
is
in
disgrace
if
worst
comes
to
worst
he
can
vanish
and
he
can
start
life
afresh
somewhere
else
with
a
clean
slate
let
a
boy
fall
into
disgrace
at
school
or
at
home
what
road
of
escape
is
open
to
him
not
one
he
is
much
more
at
the
mercy
of
parent
and
teacher
than
any
convict
is
at
his
warden
s
mercy
there
are
strict
laws
governing
the
treatment
of
prisoners
by
their
keepers
but
within
normal
bounds
no
law
holds
back
a
teacher
or
a
parent
or
both
from
making
a
boy
s
life
a
continuous
hades
add
to
all
this
the
fact
that
every
one
of
youth
s
countless
misfortunes
is
a
hopeless
black
tragedy
in
its
victim
s
eyes
and
perhaps
you
will
understand
why
boyhood
is
not
a
ceaseless
delight
if
any
man
of
were
subjected
to
the
tyranny
the
terrors
the
bitter
dependence
the
unescapable
and
heavy
penalties
for
petty
faults
that
encompass
the
average
boy
he
would
go
insane
in
a
night
there
is
no
appeal
no
way
out
for
the
boy
who
is
in
a
scrape
for
a
man
in
such
trouble
there
are
fifty
exits
small
wonder
that
so
many
lads
yearn
for
a
chance
to
make
their
own
way
in
the
world
and
that
they
shrink
in
loathing
from
the
proposed
college
course
which
will
keep
them
in
penniless
slavery
during
four
more
endless
years
they
have
not
yet
the
wit
to
understand
that
the
higher
education
is
often
a
pompously
windy
fetish
whose
chief
advantage
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
enables
its
possessors
to
look
down
on
its
this
philosophy
is
faulty
of
course
it
is
also
to
the
story
except
that
it
throws
a
light
on
arnon
flint
s
mental
processes
as
he
stood
there
the
hated
at
his
feet
trying
to
keep
his
balance
on
the
crowded
rear
platform
of
the
people
were
forever
boarding
or
leaving
the
car
a
dozen
times
arnon
was
shoved
from
one
spot
to
another
as
his
milled
and
jostled
about
him
always
with
his
toe
he
managed
to
push
the
satchel
to
his
new
standing
place
he
could
not
stoop
to
pick
it
up
the
platform
was
too
crowded
he
could
not
even
stoop
down
far
enough
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
bag
but
he
kept
in
constant
touch
with
it
by
means
of
his
at
the
gate
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
of
the
passengers
debarked
as
the
car
started
on
its
rear
platform
was
empty
except
for
arnon
and
the
conductor
and
a
sawdusty
man
in
overalls
breathing
was
easier
now
so
was
standing
a
few
blocks
farther
on
a
woman
got
out
leaving
a
seat
vacant
on
the
rear
bench
arnon
spied
the
seat
and
prepared
to
take
it
as
a
preliminary
he
bent
to
pick
up
the
satchel
from
between
his
toes
drop
that
sonny
exhorted
the
sawdusty
man
in
overalls
at
the
same
moment
arnon
was
aware
that
his
fingers
had
met
around
a
canvas
strap
and
not
around
the
satchel
s
leathern
handle
he
peered
down
in
dull
amaze
between
his
feet
was
a
carpenter
s
kit
the
was
nowhere
in
sight
the
thing
he
had
been
guarding
with
his
toes
was
this
kit
someone
had
long
since
taken
away
the
satchel
it
is
an
old
trick
this
lifting
of
a
bag
from
the
floor
of
a
crowded
vehicle
but
to
youth
no
misfortunes
are
old
all
of
them
have
the
horrible
charm
of
novelty
the
satchel
was
gone
and
it
had
not
been
taken
by
mistake
for
the
sawdusty
man
s
kit
was
the
sole
bit
of
luggage
on
the
platform
the
satchel
was
gone
and
with
it
was
gone
the
dollars
collected
the
night
before
at
the
church
bazaar
the
charity
money
that
had
been
entrusted
to
arnon
flint
to
take
to
bank
the
money
which
just
then
represented
arnon
flint
s
honour
now
as
any
sane
reader
will
know
the
one
simple
and
natural
thing
for
the
boy
to
do
was
to
notify
the
police
and
thence
to
go
home
and
tell
his
parents
what
had
happened
his
father
was
moderately
and
readily
could
have
made
up
the
deficit
yes
that
would
have
been
the
one
normal
thing
for
arnon
to
do
to
go
home
and
confess
and
his
first
name
being
neither
rollo
nor
percival
it
is
the
very
thing
he
did
not
do
from
across
the
eternal
chasm
which
divides
boyhood
from
middle
age
the
lad
s
right
course
seems
absurdly
simple
but
to
no
boy
and
to
no
one
who
recalls
the
mental
agony
of
boyhood
disgraces
will
it
appear
so
as
wisely
ask
an
unsuspected
sinner
to
write
out
a
list
of
his
misdeeds
and
to
mail
them
to
his
wife
and
to
the
police
arnon
had
a
lively
imagination
he
had
no
trouble
at
all
in
picturing
the
scene
of
his
with
such
tidings
as
were
his
he
who
had
begged
to
go
to
work
whose
father
had
fifty
times
told
him
he
had
not
enough
or
sense
of
responsibility
to
hold
a
job
for
one
week
he
must
go
home
and
admit
his
father
was
right
he
whose
weekly
spending
money
was
just
cents
must
confess
he
had
lost
dollars
the
magnitude
of
the
sum
gripped
him
with
panic
force
a
few
minutes
ago
he
had
regarded
the
bag
s
contents
as
merely
a
heavy
mass
of
small
change
now
he
knew
it
for
wealth
the
knowledge
that
he
had
committed
no
sin
did
not
buoy
him
up
in
the
very
least
a
consciousness
of
innocence
is
an
excellent
anchor
no
doubt
but
what
good
is
an
anchor
after
the
ship
has
sunk
blindly
illogical
fright
seized
the
boy
as
he
thought
of
reporting
the
loss
of
such
a
fortune
and
of
the
present
penalty
and
the
interminable
naggings
to
follow
the
unknown
has
a
host
of
terrors
lurking
at
its
heels
but
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
these
are
outweighed
by
the
more
tangible
terrors
of
the
known
which
accounts
for
suicides
beyond
lay
the
unknown
behind
lay
the
known
arnon
flint
in
a
rush
of
chose
the
unknown
in
his
pocket
was
the
best
part
of
three
dollars
the
sum
still
left
from
his
month
s
allowance
received
that
morning
he
stayed
on
the
until
it
reached
the
railroad
station
then
he
entered
the
station
and
bought
a
ticket
for
silk
city
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
to
westward
three
and
a
half
hours
later
he
stepped
down
upon
the
union
station
platform
in
silk
city
his
plan
was
made
there
was
always
work
for
willing
hands
arnon
knew
there
was
he
knew
it
because
he
had
read
it
yawningly
but
repeatedly
in
boys
uplift
a
dreary
juvenile
monthly
for
which
his
father
had
subscribed
in
arnon
s
name
arnon
intended
to
get
a
job
work
hard
live
frugally
and
save
that
lost
dollars
as
quickly
as
possible
when
he
should
have
saved
it
he
would
send
it
home
to
make
up
the
deficit
at
the
same
time
he
could
lay
pipes
for
his
own
immune
the
plan
was
perfectly
feasible
in
the
meanwhile
arnon
had
eighteen
cents
in
his
pocket
now
it
would
be
most
laudable
at
this
point
to
say
that
arnon
s
search
for
work
was
at
once
rewarded
by
a
good
job
and
that
his
industry
and
talents
won
him
swift
promotion
until
at
last
he
was
silk
city
s
merchant
king
boys
uplift
would
probably
be
eager
to
print
such
a
yarn
but
the
temptation
must
be
fought
down
this
is
merely
the
true
account
of
one
unlucky
boy
s
life
in
a
strange
city
so
back
again
to
our
story
eighteen
cents
is
a
wabbly
foundation
for
a
fortune
arnon
had
enough
sense
to
waste
none
of
it
in
buying
a
night
s
lodging
the
weather
was
hot
he
had
had
plenty
of
experience
in
camping
so
after
buying
a
big
bag
of
broken
and
a
wedge
of
dryish
cheese
for
eight
cents
he
began
to
scout
for
a
an
hour
s
wandering
brought
him
to
the
very
place
for
his
needs
silk
city
was
a
thus
its
east
end
chanced
still
to
be
unfinished
indeed
this
section
was
all
but
untouched
by
the
hand
of
man
arnon
left
behind
him
the
business
blocks
the
tangle
of
residence
streets
the
scattered
tenements
and
hovels
and
came
at
last
to
a
dreary
stretch
of
common
whither
even
the
hopeful
promoter
had
not
yet
ventured
a
corner
of
the
common
nearest
the
junction
of
two
unpaved
had
been
used
as
a
dumping
ground
here
arnon
flint
found
his
this
was
an
overturned
piano
box
one
of
whose
sides
was
caved
in
it
was
a
heavy
cumbrous
rickety
thing
yet
by
use
of
all
his
care
and
strength
arnon
managed
to
roll
and
drag
and
shove
it
into
a
shallow
a
hundred
yards
from
the
street
here
he
righted
the
box
planted
its
base
as
deeply
as
possible
in
the
sand
at
the
pit
s
bottom
and
went
back
to
the
dump
in
search
of
boards
to
reinforce
its
roof
and
for
jute
and
straw
to
serve
as
a
bed
by
sunset
he
had
rigged
up
a
fairly
watertight
abode
six
feet
long
by
four
wide
and
five
in
height
with
a
soft
if
bumpy
carpeting
of
straw
and
jute
and
as
he
proved
by
further
scouting
the
shack
was
invisible
from
the
street
then
he
tramped
to
a
leaking
hydrant
a
distant
washed
and
scoured
a
small
and
a
large
can
both
battered
but
leakless
he
had
found
on
the
dump
and
carried
home
his
night
s
supply
of
clean
water
after
which
he
sat
down
in
the
doorway
of
his
shack
and
prepared
his
evening
meal
dusk
was
creeping
over
the
day
back
at
home
just
now
the
family
were
sitting
down
to
a
repast
of
fricasseed
chicken
and
dumplings
and
pie
and
all
sorts
of
things
still
crackers
and
cheese
and
fresh
water
are
not
to
be
despised
as
an
evening
meal
particularly
when
they
are
spiced
with
adventure
and
reinforced
by
the
hunger
of
a
hustling
day
so
it
was
not
the
frugality
of
his
meal
that
made
the
fare
so
hard
for
arnon
to
eat
at
first
he
did
not
know
just
what
caused
the
lump
in
his
throat
and
what
made
even
the
tiniest
morsel
of
food
impossible
to
swallow
being
only
a
normal
boy
he
had
never
so
much
as
heard
of
psychology
nor
was
there
any
psychologist
there
to
prate
of
reaction
and
nerve
exhaustion
and
of
any
of
the
dozen
kindred
causes
which
made
the
lad
feel
as
he
did
one
of
these
causes
alone
did
arnon
understand
and
this
one
to
which
he
would
not
confess
was
bitter
lonely
homesickness
he
had
cut
himself
loose
from
everything
and
everybody
he
was
an
exile
and
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
world
for
all
he
knew
he
might
also
be
a
fugitive
from
justice
for
when
the
money
s
loss
should
be
discovered
the
bazaar
people
would
probably
think
him
a
defaulter
and
set
the
police
after
him
three
hours
earlier
arnon
had
felt
himself
a
true
blend
of
martyr
and
explorer
now
he
was
all
at
once
aware
that
he
was
just
a
lonesome
and
boy
who
had
no
one
to
love
him
and
whose
only
home
was
a
smelly
packing
box
the
lump
in
arnon
s
throat
began
to
swell
to
unbelievable
size
and
the
eyes
wherewith
he
gazed
up
over
the
at
the
dying
day
grew
foolishly
misted
this
would
never
do
angrily
he
cleared
his
throat
and
winked
very
fast
indeed
then
he
forced
himself
to
of
the
splendid
job
he
was
going
to
win
on
the
morrow
and
of
the
brevity
of
the
time
that
must
pass
before
he
should
save
up
dollars
and
be
able
to
go
home
but
the
effort
was
a
pitiful
failure
the
lump
nearly
strangled
him
and
the
mist
would
not
behave
itself
and
keep
out
of
his
silly
eyes
just
then
came
the
diversion
that
saved
him
from
the
eternal
shame
of
crying
the
dusky
skyline
at
the
edge
of
the
shallow
pit
was
broken
suddenly
by
a
small
dark
silhouette
the
boy
winked
away
his
rising
tears
once
more
and
stared
there
at
the
top
looking
inquisitively
down
head
on
one
side
stood
a
dog
not
much
of
a
dog
perhaps
for
looks
or
for
contour
or
for
size
but
still
a
dog
certainly
not
a
wolf
or
a
lion
as
the
lad
s
nerves
had
at
first
made
him
think
presently
a
second
dog
came
alongside
the
first
together
they
blinked
down
at
the
lonely
youngster
arnon
returned
their
gaze
with
keen
interest
there
was
still
light
enough
for
him
to
gain
a
clear
view
of
his
two
guests
the
first
dog
was
a
at
least
he
was
more
than
anything
else
he
held
one
forefoot
gingerly
in
air
as
though
he
were
lame
and
his
left
ear
had
evidently
been
chewed
off
as
to
tip
the
second
dog
was
a
pale
grey
formerly
white
and
had
longish
hair
he
was
of
the
general
build
and
specifications
of
a
dandy
dinmont
he
and
the
were
about
of
a
height
both
were
collarless
and
of
a
totally
disreputable
aspect
every
city
has
scores
of
such
strays
forlorn
mongrels
that
eke
out
a
rickety
living
on
the
dumps
and
in
garbage
cans
until
they
fall
prey
to
dogcatcher
or
police
or
vivisector
or
until
a
gang
of
pursuing
boys
frighten
them
into
a
blind
panic
and
thereby
start
a
new
scare
a
scare
which
wins
a
for
the
fearless
bluecoat
whose
pistol
is
emptied
into
the
harmless
and
terrified
little
fugitive
yes
to
a
s
eye
arnon
flint
s
visitors
were
merely
a
brace
of
fleasome
mongrels
to
arnon
though
they
meant
all
the
difference
between
abject
loneliness
and
loving
companionship
timidly
the
boy
chirped
to
the
dogs
up
went
their
ears
he
groped
for
a
chipped
broke
it
in
half
and
held
out
the
two
pieces
to
them
at
his
gesture
the
dogs
instinctively
shrank
back
a
result
of
the
piteous
experience
which
had
taught
them
that
a
movement
of
the
human
arm
is
far
more
likely
to
mean
a
flung
stone
than
a
proffered
dainty
but
it
had
been
a
barren
day
on
the
dumps
and
the
sight
and
smell
of
food
were
mighty
temptations
also
the
boy
was
talking
to
them
in
a
wondrous
friendly
way
and
whether
they
can
understand
words
or
not
dogs
can
read
the
human
voice
as
can
few
humans
themselves
in
arnon
s
call
the
two
strays
recognised
not
only
friendship
but
appeal
they
recognised
the
tones
of
a
here
was
no
little
devil
coaxing
them
into
range
in
order
to
tie
a
tin
can
or
a
firecracker
to
their
stumpy
tails
this
lad
was
as
much
a
waif
as
was
either
of
them
and
he
craved
chumship
even
as
did
they
slowly
hesitatingly
mincingly
the
puppies
slid
down
the
into
the
hollow
nervously
yet
greedily
they
nipped
the
offered
fragments
of
the
big
ravenously
they
ate
then
as
their
fears
lessened
they
fawned
upon
the
human
for
more
food
arnon
as
they
chewed
the
ran
his
fingers
gently
along
their
ears
and
backs
scratching
their
heads
all
the
while
talking
to
them
at
first
they
flinched
a
little
from
the
unwonted
caress
but
soon
they
courted
it
the
boy
of
a
sudden
found
himself
not
only
happy
but
ravenously
hungry
he
and
his
two
pets
finished
the
crackers
and
cheese
with
a
zest
then
all
three
curled
up
close
together
in
the
straw
and
went
to
sleep
at
sunrise
arnon
awoke
both
the
dogs
were
already
astir
as
he
raised
his
head
and
sat
looking
bewilderedly
about
they
ran
frisking
up
to
him
and
thus
began
the
life
of
the
three
chums
in
the
s
shack
it
was
a
wonderful
life
for
all
of
them
for
arnon
the
dogs
presence
was
a
veritable
godsend
the
boy
set
forth
early
that
first
morning
to
look
for
a
job
naturally
he
did
not
find
one
not
only
do
business
houses
cut
down
their
working
force
in
summer
instead
of
adding
to
it
but
a
boy
with
no
references
has
at
best
a
hard
time
in
landing
a
steady
position
especially
if
he
stammers
and
grows
red
when
he
is
asked
where
he
lives
and
the
name
of
his
father
no
in
spite
of
boys
uplift
no
kindly
merchant
was
so
impressed
by
arnon
s
manliness
and
good
manners
as
to
offer
to
teach
him
the
business
from
the
bottom
up
with
a
view
of
making
him
later
on
a
partner
arnon
after
a
s
futile
began
to
see
how
matters
stood
he
was
sore
inclined
to
give
up
the
fight
and
to
tramp
all
the
way
back
to
his
parents
home
but
at
once
he
remembered
he
could
not
he
had
responsibilities
responsibilities
he
could
not
shirk
at
the
shack
his
two
were
waiting
for
his
return
he
could
not
take
them
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
afoot
he
had
no
means
of
feeding
them
on
the
way
even
if
no
farm
dogs
should
kill
them
or
rural
poundmasters
seize
them
no
they
relied
on
him
and
he
had
no
right
to
fail
them
he
must
stick
that
afternoon
by
three
hours
of
hanging
around
the
union
station
he
cleared
up
twenty
cents
carrying
and
opening
motorcar
doors
he
stopped
at
a
grocery
on
his
way
back
to
the
and
continued
his
journey
with
a
very
respectable
armful
of
provisions
as
he
neared
the
common
arnon
quickened
not
only
his
steps
but
his
heartbeats
suppose
he
were
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
his
two
new
friends
suppose
they
were
only
of
the
cadging
type
and
had
deserted
the
shack
the
moment
his
back
had
been
turned
the
thought
sickened
him
it
was
for
his
dogs
not
for
himself
he
had
been
working
that
day
he
reached
the
edge
and
halted
at
the
same
instant
two
furry
little
whirlwinds
burst
forth
from
the
shack
whizzed
up
the
steep
sandy
bank
and
with
barks
of
ecstasy
hurled
themselves
bodily
upon
the
returning
what
sweeter
could
a
heartsick
and
tired
exile
ask
arnon
dropped
his
parcels
fell
on
his
knees
and
gathered
his
loyal
little
comrades
into
one
expansive
squirming
yapping
embrace
through
his
delight
at
their
welcome
ran
a
thrill
of
joy
in
his
own
correct
judgment
of
dog
nature
after
which
the
entire
party
adjourned
to
the
shack
for
supper
a
glorious
meal
it
was
during
its
progress
the
revealed
himself
as
a
personage
of
rare
education
by
sitting
up
on
his
to
beg
for
and
by
rolling
over
twice
in
gratitude
at
receiving
such
gifts
the
dandy
dinmont
had
fewer
accomplishments
but
he
showed
himself
a
dog
of
great
natural
gifts
by
mastering
at
the
third
attempt
the
art
of
catching
in
his
mouth
a
piece
of
cracker
placed
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
arnon
was
quite
certain
that
never
before
had
two
such
remarkable
animals
come
into
any
one
boy
s
life
they
not
only
learned
tricks
with
the
bewildering
quickness
that
a
mongrel
always
possesses
and
a
thoroughbred
so
seldom
acquires
but
they
speedily
learned
to
look
on
their
new
master
as
a
god
and
to
worship
him
as
such
arnon
named
the
hairy
dog
dandy
and
the
buck
chiefly
because
the
names
seemed
to
fit
like
gloves
morning
after
morning
arnon
tramped
silk
city
looking
in
vain
for
a
steady
job
every
afternoon
he
spent
at
the
union
station
rustling
the
of
passengers
and
opening
automobile
doors
for
them
for
which
service
he
averaged
from
fifteen
to
forty
cents
a
day
on
the
lean
days
he
and
his
chums
breakfasted
and
supped
on
crackers
and
cheese
on
days
of
larger
wealth
they
banqueted
regally
on
bread
and
butter
and
tinned
meats
and
ginger
snaps
for
an
hour
morning
and
night
the
three
romped
and
frolicked
together
and
added
to
the
marvelous
list
of
tricks
they
had
studied
all
night
through
summer
heat
or
summer
rain
they
slept
in
the
shack
cuddled
into
one
loving
triple
heap
oh
but
it
was
a
jolly
life
for
them
all
as
to
the
future
the
winter
for
instance
arnon
had
no
thought
nor
care
you
see
he
was
only
a
youngster
so
how
could
he
be
expected
to
have
greater
forethought
than
have
the
army
of
grown
men
who
live
up
to
every
penny
of
their
yearly
income
with
no
constructive
worry
concerning
joblessness
or
old
age
for
a
long
happy
month
life
was
sweet
in
the
pineboard
shack
arnon
had
occasional
twinges
of
homesickness
and
he
had
more
than
occasional
twinges
of
conscience
at
his
failure
to
begin
saving
the
missing
dollars
but
on
the
whole
he
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
this
was
true
adventure
this
outcast
summer
routine
of
his
and
it
was
a
truer
comradeship
too
than
any
he
had
known
on
the
fourth
of
july
he
celebrated
by
adorning
each
of
his
chums
with
a
bow
culled
from
a
length
of
bedraggled
tricolour
ribbon
he
had
found
in
a
gutter
on
his
own
birthday
a
week
later
he
spent
cents
upon
a
truly
regal
spread
in
honour
of
the
event
after
the
sumptuous
meal
he
treated
an
invisible
audience
to
the
full
programme
of
his
dogs
tricks
it
was
a
gala
night
at
the
shack
next
afternoon
arnon
came
home
a
later
than
usual
having
had
to
carry
a
to
a
new
neighbourhood
and
having
made
a
wrong
turn
on
his
way
back
to
the
common
as
he
neared
the
he
whistled
then
he
paused
to
watch
for
the
usual
scurrying
race
of
his
chums
up
the
to
meet
him
but
no
frantic
or
multiple
patter
of
feet
followed
upon
his
whistle
at
a
jump
arnon
was
down
in
the
pit
the
dogs
were
not
there
it
was
twilight
before
his
search
of
the
region
was
ended
this
was
its
end
stammeringly
he
asked
a
passing
patrolman
whether
he
had
seen
two
little
dogs
one
black
one
light
grey
trotting
anywhere
along
the
beat
and
the
policeman
made
curt
answer
nope

didn

see

next
morning
after
ten
hours
of
sleeplessness
arnon
was
at
the
pier
again
waiting
for
its
landward
gate
to
swing
open
for
the
day
after
an
endless
delay
one
of
the
poundmaster
s
men
arrived
arnon
followed
him
along
the
pier
to
the
enormous
grated
pen
and
the
adjoining
office
at
the
far
end
of
the
dock
in
the
cage
were
more
dogs
than
arnon
had
ever
before
seen
together
in
all
his
life
puppy
whelp
and
hound
and
curs
of
low
they
were
crowded
into
the
big
barred
inclosure
a
pitiful
assemblage
some
dogs
were
howling
some
were
barking
some
were
feverishly
back
and
forth
from
corner
to
corner
pressing
close
against
the
bars
others
mystically
aware
of
their
coming
fate
lay
trembling
convulsively
from
time
to
time
heads
between
forepaws
eyes
abrim
with
dumb
grief
at
the
pier
s
outer
edge
just
beyond
the
barred
pen
an
iron
cage
swung
over
the
river
it
hung
from
a
derrick
daily
this
cage
was
filled
with
the
dogs
that
had
been
longest
at
the
pound
then
it
was
dipped
under
water
for
five
minutes
in
full
sight
of
the
doomed
survivors
in
the
pen
a
is
not
pleasant
to
look
upon
it
is
little
pleasanter
to
think
upon
it
is
one
of
the
needful
evils
of
every
large
town
an
evil
that
is
needful
to
public
health
and
to
public
safety
so
say
the
city
fathers
it
is
also
needful
because
though
people
talk
much
about
among
humans
where
it
can
not
be
enforced
no
one
bothers
about
among
dogs
where
it
can
very
easily
be
enforced
litters
of
dogs
are
allowed
to
grow
up
the
dogs
are
portioned
among
people
who
grow
tired
of
them
or
who
move
away
the
erstwhile
pets
are
turned
out
to
run
the
streets
and
to
starve
or
to
pick
up
a
scavenger

the
grim
does
the
rest
the
luckless
waifs
are
done
to
death
by

or
by

in
the
legalised
hell
of
vivisection
may
the
god
of
the
little
people
have
mercy
upon
them
for
most
assuredly
mankind
will
not
arnon
stared
into
the
thronged
pen
at
first
in
the
dim
light
he
could
make
out
nothing
then
through
lips
that
would
not
steady
themselves
he
gave
the
old
familiar
whistle
instantly
there
was
a
scuttling
and
scampering
from
amid
the
ruck
of
dogs
two
series
of
wildly
eager
barks
cut
the
looser
volume
of
howls
and
dandy
and
buck
came
racing
up
to
the
bars
that
separated
them
from
their
adored
master
a
minute
later
a
very
and
arnon
flint
stalked
into
the
poundmaster
s
office
forcing
his
voice
raspingly
through
the
emotion
that
sanded
his
throat
he
demanded
of
the
man
in
charge
how
much
does
it
cost
to
get
a
dog
out
of
the
pound
i
ve
i
ve
got
a
couple
of
them
in
the
fat
man
at
the
desk
looked
up
wholly
without
interest
children
coming
to
plead
for
the
return
of
their
pets
were
no
novelty
at
all
to
him
have
no
silly
sentiment
if
they
had
they
would
not
be
but
normal
humans
dollar
apiece
he
grunted
that
pays
their
license
he
turned
back
to
his
newspaper
and
promptly
forgot
the
existence
of
the
shaky
and
boy
arnon
ventured
one
more
question
how
long
he
quavered
how
long
do
you
keep
them
here
before
before
you
depends
on
how
many
there
are
snapped
the
man
this
time
without
looking
up
in
summer
we
dowse
about
twenty
a
that
was
all
arnon
stood
gaping
uncertainly
for
a
moment
then
he
lurched
out
of
the
office
and
back
to
where
his
chums
pawed
at
the
bars
waiting
for
him
to
take
them
home
some
time
later
an
attendant
dumped
a
bucketful
of
into
the
centre
of
the
pen
immediately
the
larger
and
fiercer
dogs
fell
upon
the
food
crowding
or
scaring
the
smaller
curs
away
from
it
it
was
all
wolfed
down
by
the
bullies
of
the
pen
before
their
weaker
or
more
timid
brethren
had
had
a
mouthful
the
boy
recalled
now
that
he
had
crammed
most
of
last
night
s
untasted
supper
into
his
pockets
to
serve
him
as
breakfast
during
his
search
for
his
chums
quickly
he
emptied
his
pockets
apportioning
the
contents
between
buck
and
dandy
and
harshly
ordering
off
such
larger
dogs
as
came
snooping
around
for
a
share
in
the
meal
at
last
he
went
away
there
was
no
time
to
waste
if
he
was
to
earn
that
two
dollars
for
his
dogs
ransom
two
dollars
why
the
largest
sum
he
had
ever
earned
in
one
day
at
silk
city
was
cents
and
oftener
he
had
not
earned
half
that
amount
yet
the
money
must
be
gotten
somehow
and
soon
then
there
was
another
handicap
out
of
his
earnings
he
must
buy
food
for
buck
and
dandy
during
their
imprisonment
if
he
did
not
want
them
to
starve
incidentally
he
himself
must
have
food
though
he
wanted
none
in
order
to
keep
strong
enough
to
work
all
day
he
haunted
the
union
station
at
sunset
he
was
back
at
the
pound
with
a
bagful
of
for
his
chums
he
sat
beside
the
bars
talking
to
them
and
putting
them
through
their
tricks
until
the
pier
closed
then
he
ran
all
the
way
to
the
theatre
district
in
the
hope
of
earning
a
few
cents
more
by
opening
the
doors
of
motorcars
and
carriages
at
the
end
of
three
days
of
and
of
work
he
had
collected
cents
this
was
all
he
had
been
able
to
save
after
buying
food
for
his
pets
and
a
daily
cracker
or
two
for
himself
and
he
had
sought
work
in
every
waking
hour
except
such
times
as
he
set
aside
for
visiting
the
pound
at
dawn
on
the
fourth
day
he
found
a
dollar
bill
in
the
street
an
traveller
gave
him
cents
more
for
carrying
a
heavy
a
mile
to
the
station
the
moment
the
fee
was
paid
arnon
dashed
off
for
the
pound
he
had
not
only
the
ransom
but
fourteen
cents
left
over
wherewith
to
buy
the
materials
for
a
reunion
feast
at
the
shack
his
dizzy
weakness
and
hunger
were
clean
forgot
in
the
mad
joy
of
victory
panting
unsteady
on
his
legs
he
rushed
down
the
pier
before
going
into
the
office
he
paused
at
the
pen
to
tell
his
glorious
news
to
the
two
prisoners
but
his
shrill
whistle
brought
no
response
he
bent
down
shading
his
eyes
and
stared
into
the
pen
neither
buck
nor
dandy
was
there
the
souse
of
the
as
it
smote
the
water
and
the
simultaneous
crazed
screams
of
its
twenty
passengers
reached
his
ears
and
he
understood
no
longer
did
arnon
try
to
fight
back
the
babyish
tears
he
fell
face
downward
on
the
pier
and
gave
way
to
hysterical
weeping
his
chums
his
dear
wonderful
chums
the
little
loyal
dogs
that
had
loved
him
and
had
comforted
him
so
prettily
in
his
stark
aloneness
and
that
had
been
so
perfectly
trustful
in
his
power
to
save
them
a
man
s
hand
gripped
arnon
s
heaving
shoulder
and
sought
to
raise
him
to
his
feet
the
touch
turned
his
desolate
grief
into
a
rage
that
was
all
but
murderous
this
by
one
word
could
have
saved
dandy
and
buck
and
instead
he
had
drowned
them
with
a
beast
snarl
the
boy
was
on
his
feet
you
he
screeched
as
he
whirled
towards
the
man
when
i
m
big
enough
i
m
coming
back
to
smash
every
bone
in
your
fat
body
and
i
m
going
to
his
words
caught
in
his
throat
with
a
click
this
was
not
the
fat
man
it
was
arnon
flint
s
father
the
boy
gaped
dazedly
yes
it
was
his
father
but
arnon
cared
not
one
whit
for
that
his
father
could
send
him
to
jail
for
theft
or
could
whale
him
with
a
horsewhip
or
do
anything
rotten
he
chose
it
didn
t
matter
all
that
mattered
was
that
buck
and
dandy
were
dead
he
glowered
up
into
the
man
s
face
ready
for
anything
that
might
befall
then
his
glower
turned
to
a
look
of
perplexity
his
father
did
not
glower
back
instead
flint
s
face
was
unspeakably
tender
oh
my
little
boy
he
was
saying
brokenly
dad
s
own
crazy
little
boy
you
re
worn
to
a
shadow
we
ve
looked
everywhere
for
you
it
wasn
t
till
yesterday
our
detectives
struck
the
trail
and
i
came
right
i
didn
t
steal
the
money
said
arnon
dully
the
bazaar
money
i
lost
it
on
the
i
tried
to
get
a
job
to
make
it
up
to
the
church
but
i
know
i
know
broke
in
his
father
in
that
same
unbelievably
tender
and
quivering
voice
don
t
think
any
more
about
it
i
ve
paid
it
why
dear
lad
no
one
ever
supposed
you
stole
it
we
knew
you
couldn
t
will
you
come
back
home
with
me
son
mother
is
pretty
nearly
as
thin
as
you
are
from
worry
over
i
ll
come
if
you
like
agreed
arnon
listlessly
it
doesn
t
matter
much
now
either
way
i
might
as
well
be
there
as
good
approved
his
father
we
can
just
make
the
ten
o
clock
train
if
we
hurry
i
ve
got
a
taxi
waiting
at
the
other
end
of
the
side
by
side
father
and
son
walked
away
from
the
pound
the
boy
s
eyes
were
downcast
his
face
was
haggard
his
heart
was
dead
from
time
to
time
as
they
walked
the
man
stole
a
covert
glance
at
him
and
his
own
face
contracted
as
in
sharp
pain
here
s
the
taxi
said
flint
at
last
open
the
door
will
you
you
re
nearer
to
it
than
i
mechanically
arnon
turned
the
handle
as
he
pulled
the
taxi
door
ajar
two
furry
catapults
from
within
the
vehicle
launched
themselves
rapturously
and
yelpingly
upon
him
you
see
explained
flint
to
his
unhearing
son
i
had
quite
a
talk
with
the
poundmaster
before
you
got
here
this
morning
he
s
been
noticing
you
it
seems
and
he
told
me
a
rather
pathetic
little
story
when
i
heard
it
i
decided
to
make
an
investment
in
livestock
i
was
putting
these
two
puppies
into
the
taxi
when
you
hobbled
past
me
on
your
way
to
the
pound
i
arnon
was
sobbing
in
a
frenzy
of
bliss
buck
at
sound
of
their
names
the
dogs
wriggled
free
from
arnon
s
embrace
just
for
the
uproarious
fun
of
hurling
themselves
once
more
upon
him
hurry
up
son
suggested
flint
clearing
his
throat
noisily
get
aboard
you
and
the
pups
we
ll
miss
that
train
not
on
your
sweet
life
we
won
t
miss
it
exulted
arnon
scrambling
into
the
taxi
with
his
pets
we
ve
to
catch
it
you
see
i
i
want
my
chums
to
to
meet
mother
just
as
soon
as
they
can
they
re
dead
sure
to
like
stuff
happiness
to
jeff
titus
had
become
a
fine
art
it
had
become
so
when
he
married
eve
wallace
a
little
wisp
of
a
city
girl
who
had
come
to
the
kentucky
mountain
hinterland
to
cure
a
set
of
weak
lungs
and
who
had
not
only
wedded
but
civilised
the
lanky
young
mountaineer
happiness
had
remained
a
fine
art
for
jeff
up
there
on
his
bare
hillside
farm
with
eve
it
had
remained
so
for
the
most
part
ever
since
his
wedding
and
now
in
a
single
breath
happiness
had
taken
a
place
among
the
lost
arts
the
single
breath
had
been
supplied
by
a
sour
east
wind
which
had
smitten
eve
as
she
stood
in
the
shack
dooryard
waiting
for
her
husband
s
she
was
thinly
clad
and
she
was
in
a
perspiration
from
working
in
her
flower
garden
her
lungs
were
still
weak
the
east
wind
did
the
rest
by
night
she
had
a
heavy
cold
the
third
morning
pneumonia
flung
out
its
flaming
red
no
surrender
signal
on
each
of
her
cheeks
and
life
to
jeff
titus
all
at
once
became
a
horror
a
frightened
anguish
gripped
him
by
the
throat
and
shook
him
to
the
bewildered
soul
as
he
crouched
night
after
night
beside
the
slab
bed
where
tossed
and
muttered
the
delirious
little
wisp
of
a
woman
who
was
at
once
his
mate
and
his
saint
eve
was
so
tiny
so
fragile
so
good
it
wasn
t
fair
that
this
bullying
unseen
spirit
of
illness
should
torture
and
harry
her
and
sap
the
life
of
her
while
the
man
who
right
blithely
would
have
been
burned
to
a
crisp
to
please
her
sat
helpless
at
the
bedside
unable
to
do
a
thing
to
drive
forth
the
damnable
visitant
jeff
titus
dwelt
upon
the
theme
of
his
own
impotence
to
save
her
he
swore
venomously
and
in
the
peculiarly
hideous
diction
of
kentucky
mountaineer
blasphemy
there
were
doctors
of
course
in
the
county
seat
of
duneka
miles
away
but
they
might
as
well
have
been
in
austria
for
all
the
good
they
could
do
the
sick
girl
jeff
could
not
desert
eve
to
go
in
quest
of
such
a
physician
nor
could
he
send
one
of
his
neighbours
he
knew
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
those
city
doctors
had
no
convenient
means
of
getting
over
the
miles
of
trail
to
his
hinterland
farm
assuredly
none
of
them
was
going
to
make
the
journey
on
foot
or
on
leaving
his
town
practice
for
days
at
the
behest
of
a
who
perhaps
could
not
or
would
not
pay
for
the
sacrifice
meantime
eve
was
growing
worse
steadily
worse
even
the
ignorant
jeff
could
see
that
so
apparently
could
the
only
sharer
of
his
vigils
a
huge
and
lionlike
dog
which
lay
pressed
close
to
the
far
side
of
the
bed
and
which
all
titus
commands
could
not
keep
out
of
the
this
dog
robin
adair
was
the
joy
of
eve
s
heart
or
he
had
been
when
her
heart
still
could
hold
joy
and
not
merely
fever
and
delirium
one
of
eve
s
ragged
admirers
had
given
the
dog
to
her
in
the
old
days
when
robin
was
a
mass
of
fluff
no
bigger
than
a
persian
cat
the
dog
had
grown
into
a
shaggy
giant
a
passing
man
had
told
eve
he
was
a
collie
a
breed
of
which
she
had
heard
in
a
vague
fashion
as
emanating
from
scotland
and
she
had
named
him
robin
adair
after
the
hero
of
a
scotch
song
her
mother
had
been
wont
to
sing
he
was
robin
for
short
when
she
had
married
jeff
titus
she
had
brought
her
beloved
collie
to
live
at
the
mountain
shack
from
the
moment
his
mistress
fell
ill
robin
had
not
once
willingly
stirred
from
her
bedside
drinking
little
eating
nothing
the
great
dog
had
lain
there
his
sorrowing
brown
eyes
fixed
on
the
small
white
figure
in
the
big
slab
bed
but
of
late
he
was
beginning
to
vary
the
vigil
by
whines
from
time
to
time
and
once
or
twice
his
huge
body
quivered
as
if
in
physical
pain
it
was
on
the
dawn
of
the
fourth
day
that
robin
got
to
his
feet
with
a
leap
and
pointing
his
heavy
muzzle
skyward
set
the
still
room
to
reverberating
with
a
yell
that
was
nothing
short
of
unearthly
jeff
starting
from
his
daze
of
misery
made
as
though
to
throttle
the
brute
that
had
broken
in
on
the
invalid
s
unresting
rest
then
remembering
eve
s
affection
for
the
collie
he
contented
himself
with
picking
robin
up
bodily
and
bearing
him
towards
the
door
with
the
intent
of
putting
him
out
of
the
house
the
door
before
jeff
could
reach
it
was
flung
open
from
outside
on
the
threshold
stood
a
ramrodlike
figure
in
rusty
black
the
caller
was
the
reverend
ephraim
stair
methodist
for
the
counties
and
a
man
whose
brain
and
heart
had
long
since
made
him
the
blindly
obeyed
autocrat
of
his
scattered
mountain
flock
what
s
wrong
titus
was
his
wondering
greeting
as
his
sharp
old
eyes
flashed
from
the
man
with
the
big
dog
in
his
arms
to
the
eternally
whispering
little
form
on
the
bed
i
heard
a
scream
as
i
was
riding
past
and
oh
parson
gasped
jeff
in
babbling
relief
dumping
robin
on
the
puncheon
floor
and
gripping
the
by
both
hands
for
gawd
s
sake
suthin
fer
her
she
acts
like
like
she
ain
t
goin
to
git
well
none
loud
through
the
mountains
were
the
praises
of
stair
s
medical
lore
many
were
the
tales
of
sick
folk
he
had
cured
when
the
old
women
had
given
them
up
and
had
begun
gruesomely
relishful
preparations
for
the
funeral
jeff
titus
clutched
at
his
unexpected
presence
as
at
a
half
in
superstitious
awe
he
glanced
at
the
dog
whose
providential
screech
had
made
the
clergyman
halt
in
his
brisk
ride
from
one
county
seat
to
the
next
meantime
stair
had
crossed
to
the
bed
and
on
his
knees
beside
it
was
examining
the
stricken
eve
jeff
came
up
behind
him
standing
awkwardly
and
with
open
mouth
in
expectation
of
some
miracle
but
no
miracle
was
vouchsafed
instead
the
clergyman
asked
one
or
two
questions
as
to
the
illness
course
felt
the
patient
s
pulse
and
her
torrid
cheek
then
ordered
his
host
to
go
and
fetch
in
his
saddlebags
my
is
in
them
he
explained
and
you
can
stable
my
horse
too
i
m
going
to
she
she
s
goin
to
git
on
all
right
now

t
she
pleaded
titus
ingratiatingly
pausing
at
the
door
get
my
saddlebags
was
the
retort
jump
then
you
can
heat
some
water
wait
before
you
go
open
those
windows
and
leave
the
door
open
isn
t
this
poor
child
having
enough
trouble
in
breathing
without
your
sealing
the
room
hermetically
sick
folks

jeff
defended
himself
nevertheless
obeying
it
gives
em

gives
them
life
retorted
stair
now
get
those
saddlebags
next
morning
eve
was
perceptibly
worse
the
breathing
was
more
laboured
the
fever
blazed
higher
this
in
spite
of
stair
and
his
ceaseless
ministrations
stark
despair
tore
at
the
husband
s
throat
following
stair
as
the
left
the
room
for
a
moment
to
wash
his
hands
at
the
pump
titus
demanded
fiercely
she
s
to
die
ain
t
she
spit
out
the
truth
man
i
got
a
right
to
hear
it
i
can
t
say
answered
stair
taking
no
offence
at
the
furious
manner
she
is
in
the
midst
of
the
crisis
now
it
is
the
in
such
cases
if
she
rallies
from
that
meanwhile
we
can
only
hope
and
work
it
is
in
god
s
hands
she
in
gawd
s
hands
mocked
jeff
wildly
in
hands
hey
you
re
mighty
fond
of
blattin
bout
gawd
parson
but
i
take
notice
he
ain
t
nothin

that
pore
sick
gal
of
mine
in
yonder
why
ain
t
he
where
is
he
anyhow
if
he
cain
t
he
is
answered
stair
very
quietly
here
and
in
that
delirious
girl
s
room
back
there
he
is
wherever
his
children
cry
out
to
him
in
sorrow
and
pain
just
as
in
your
inmost
heart
you
are
crying
to
him
now
if
his
children
are
too
deaf
or
too
scared
or
too
noisy
in
their
grief
to
know
he
has
come
at
their
call
then
the
fault
is
with
their
own
stupidity
and
not
with
the
father
who
is
carrying
them
through
the
he
pushed
past
the
mouthing
titus
and
went
back
to
his
post
in
the
on
the
second
morning
eve
was
in
a
heavy
sleep
her
forehead
was
moist
stair
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
motioned
jeff
out
into
the
dooryard
on
his
withered
face
was
the
glow
of
a
conqueror
harshly
as
if
in
doubt
of
his
own
the
said
the
crisis
is
past
she
has
turned
the
corner
i
think
she

incontinently
jeff
titus
bolted
around
the
side
of
the
house
and
out
of
sight
into
the
woods
when
he
returned
an
hour
later
he
was
carrying
a
of
kindling
circumstantially
and
at
some
length
he
explained
to
stair
that
he
had
spent
the
entire
hour
in
looking
for
it
stair
accepted
the
explanation
in
grave
credulity
and
forebore
to
glance
towards
the
heap
of
kindling
in
the
woodshed
at
noon
eve
awoke
she
was
very
weak
very
tired
very
thin
and
but
she
was
and
in
jeff
s
heart
there
was
something
that
made
him
yearn
to
howl
aloud
in
rapture
and
roll
on
the
grass
and
to
join
the
church
all
over
again
and
to
thrash
some
mythical
man
for
speaking
mythical
ill
of
ephraim
stair
and
to
turn
over
his
farm
and
his
savings
to
foreign
missions
and
to
get
very
drunk
indeed
and
to
buy
eve
a
gold
watch
being
a
kentucky
mountaineer
and
a
titus
to
boot
he
contented
himself
with
grinning
down
upon
his
sick
wife
and
grunting
feel
better
that
s
nice
be
all
right
pretty
soon
now
reckon
i
d
best
be
gittin
in
some
more
wood
b
fore
it
rains
so
long
robin
adair
like
his
master
knew
eve
was
on
the
way
to
health
again
but
being
only
a
dog
and
not
a
mountaineer
robin
did
not
sneak
out
of
the
house
to
hide
his
emotion
he
stood
beside
the
bed
his
dark
eyes
aglow
his
furry
bulk
quivering
all
over
with
puppyish
joy
and
wagging
his
plumed
tail
frantically
every
time
his
mistress
looked
at
him
one
evening
a
few
days
later
the
two
men
were
smoking
together
in
the
dooryard
before
turning
in
eve
had
been
made
comfortable
for
the
night
and
was
asleep
she
had
gained
a
little
ground
but
her
convalescence
was
maddeningly
slow
and
uncertain
to
jeff
the
horror
of
the
past
fortnight
or
so
had
left
him
in
spite
of
all
stair
s
assurances
he
could
not
throw
off
his
fear
for
her
safety
she
has
been
through
a
terrible
illness
patiently
explained
stair
for
the
hundredth
time
her
body
and
her
mind
are
exhausted
she
lies
there
like
that
because
she
is
resting
she
is
resting
because
nature
is
making
her
rest
she
is
steadily
getting
better
bar
accidents
she
is
practically
out
of
danger
her
strength
is
beginning
to
seep
back
too
it
would
come
back
faster
of
course
if
she
could
rally
her
tired
mind
to
some
great
interest
in
life
something
that
wouldn
t
tire
or
excite
her
too
much
it
would
help
mother
nature
along
an
interest
in
life
is
a
wonderful
aid
in
convalescence
a
bit
of
unexpected
good
news
for
instance
good
news
hey
mused
jeff
his
bony
hands
supporting
his
leathern
face
as
he
cogitated
good
news
h
m
yes
returned
stair
that
or
something
pleasant
to
look
forward
to
when
she
s
well
enough

might
take
her
to
duneka
or

the
fourth
day
of

that
s
the
day
after
the
said
there
was
to
be
reel
silver
cups
offered
fer
best
dawgs
of
a
lot
of
breeds
collies
was
one
of
the
breeds
it
spoke
well
asked
stair
in
no
special
interest
as
jeff
paused
wal
went
on
the
mountaineer
sheepishly
know
how
much
store
eve
sets
by
robin
here
she
thinks
he
s
jest
the
finest
dawg
on
this
yer
planet
she
was
there
couldn
t
be
no
finer
dawg
in
the
collie
bunch
at
the
show
than
what
robin
is
an
she
was
honin
fer
us
to
take
him
down
there
an
let
him
git
a
chance
at
that
silver
cup
wal
whatever
eve
hones
fer
she
s
to
git
if
it
s
gittable
an
if
i
m
in
reach
to
git
it
fer
her
so
i
greed
we
d
take
robin
to
the
show
she
was
all
het
up
over
the
idee
of
that
ere
cup
an
she
was
how
grand
it
d
be
to
have
the
paper
print
robin
s
name
as
winnin
it
so
s
she
c
d
send
a
copy
of
the
paper
to
her
folks
down
looeyville
way
an
all
that
wal
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
he
ended
with
a
loud
sigh
why
is
that
all
there
is
to
it
demanded
stair
with
sudden
inspiration
why
can
t
you
take
the
dog
down
to
the
show
yourself
if
he
really
has
a
chance
for
the
cup
that
cup
and
the
notice
in
the
paper
would
do
more
to
stir
eve
up
and
to
renew
her
interest
in
life
than
any
other
good
news
i
can
think
of
and
it
ll
be
something
to
look
forward
to
go
ahead
and
do
it
good
oh
exulted
a
feeble
little
voice
in
the
room
behind
them
eve
had
waked
during
their
talk
and
in
her
tones
as
she
applauded
the
plan
rang
the
first
interest
she
had
shown
since
the
beginning
of
her
illness
stair
listening
shut
his
thin
lips
on
a
belated
objection
that
had
come
into
his
mind
while
the
mountaineer
was
applauding
his
chance
suggestion
it
had
just
occurred
to
the
that
if
robin
should
not
be
adjudged
worthy
of
the
cup
the
disappointment
was
likely
to
do
the
invalid
more
harm
than
a
week
of
nursing
could
counteract
but
it
was
too
late
to
voice
that
warning
now
eve
had
heard
eve
was
pathetically
eager
over
the
scheme
and
kicking
himself
mentally
for
his
own
impulsiveness
the
clergyman
held
his
peace
he
knew
nothing
about
dogs
from
a
show
standpoint
and
mightily
he
hoped
eve
s
estimate
of
her
pet
might
be
correct
but
he
doubted
more
and
more
he
doubted
collies
fit
to
win
silver
cups
do
not
often
find
their
way
into
the
mountaineer
cabins
in
the
kentucky
hinterland
timidly
stair
sought
to
the
venture
but
again
he
was
too
late
at
last
eve
had
the
desired
interest
in
life
an
interest
that
threatened
to
bring
back
her
fever
the
virus
is
potent
as
any
exhibitor
can
testify
it
has
a
mystic
lure
jeff
once
he
grasped
the
idea
was
swept
off
his
feet
by
it
the
fall
county
fair
at
duneka
had
begun
its
fourth
day
that
day
s
star
feature
was
to
be
the
all
breeds
to
be
held
in
the
agricultural
building
a
gratifying
number
of
dogs
was
benched
in
the
main
hall
of
the
ramshackle
structure
early
on
the
morning
of
the
show
two
stewards
were
busy
receiving
the
entrants
assigning
to
them
their
places
in
the
double
aisles
of
and
benches
and
assessing
the
usual
extra
fees
for
to
these
grievously
overworked
functionaries
in
the
thick
of
their
labours
appeared
a
lanky
farmer
of
the
true
mountaineer
type
he
was
clad
in
that
sat
on
his
angular
figure
as
might
a
on
a
washboard
by
a
rope
the
led
a
large
and
shaggy
dog
whose
rough
tawny
coat
had
been
washed
and
brushed
until
it
shone
like
bronze
and
fluffed
out
like
the
hair
of
a
circassian
beauty
collie
dawg
announced
jeff
owned
by
miz
jeff
titus
entered
for
the
silver
patiently
the
stewards
explained
to
him
that
a
dog
must
be
entered
for
one
or
more
of
the
show
s
regular
classes
and
that
the
coveted
silver
cup
was
to
go
to
the
collie
adjudged
best
in
the
whole
show
they
also
informed
jeff
that
as
his
was
a
it
would
cost
him
an
extra
fifty
cents
to
exhibit
his
dog
he
was
told
that
in
addition
to
this
it
would
cost
him
a
dollar
for
every
class
in
which
he
might
enter
robin
as
most
of
this
was
greek
to
the
puzzled
exhibitor
one
of
the
stewards
asked
if
the
dog
had
ever
before
been
shown
on
receiving
a
negative
answer
he
took
one
look
at
the
uninterested
robin
and
suggested
he
be
entered
for
the
novice
class
alone
as
soon
as
he
could
be
made
to
understand
that
a
collie
winning
in
the
novice
class
would
stand
as
good
a
chance
for
the
cup
as
would
any
other
titus
paid
over
his
money
and
led
robin
to
the
stall
in
the
collie
section
corresponding
to
the
number
the
steward
had
tied
to
the
dog
s
collar
after
mooring
robin
s
rope
to
the
ring
in
his
bench
and
getting
him
some
water
jeff
had
leisure
to
take
in
his
odd
surroundings
dogs
dogs
everywhere
dogs
more
dogs
than
jeff
had
known
existed
dogs
of
all
breeds
and
sizes
from
peke
to
bernard
the
roof
was
with
their
clangour
they
were
barking
or
yapping
in
fifty
different
keys
but
all
with
the
same
earnestness
jeff
saw
that
each
breed
had
a
to
itself
in
the
hall
s
centre
to
which
the
bench
aisles
converged
were
two
inclosures
in
each
of
which
were
a
low
central
platform
and
a
corner
table
and
a
chair
on
the
tables
were
neat
piles
of
red
and
yellow
and
blue
ribbons
alongside
a
handlers
were
everywhere
busy
making
their
pets
ready
for
the
judging
crowds
of
onlookers
had
already
begun
to
filter
through
the
aisles
jeff
heard
someone
say
that
the
judging
was
about
to
begin
and
that
collies
were
to
be
among
the
first
breeds
shown
his
general
curiosity
sated
titus
fell
to
examining
the
dogs
which
were
to
be
robin
s
competitors
and
at
once
his
mountaineer
scowl
merged
into
a
grin
here
forsooth
was
nothing
wherewith
the
splendid
robin
need
fear
comparison
why
of
all
the
nineteen
collies
on
exhibition
there
was
not
one
within
three
inches
of
robin
s
height
nor
one
which
bore
any
real
resemblance
to
him
these
others
were
strongly
slender
chaps
with
thin
heads
and
tapering
noses
and
tulip
ears
and
slant
eyes
whereas
robin
s
mighty
head
was
almost
as
broad
and
heavy
as
a
newfoundland
s
his
ears
were
pricked
like
a
wolf
s
and
his
honest
brown
eyes
were
large
and
round
no
most
assuredly
he
was
not
in
the
very
least
like
any
other
collie
entered
in
the
show
or
in
any
exhibition
of
thoroughbreds
since
the
birth
of
time
poor
old
robin
adair
was
probably
more
collie
than
anything
else
he
may
even
have
been
a
shade
more
than
but
in
his
veins
ran
also
the
mixed
blood
of
many
another
breed
newfoundland
predominating
look
over
there
jeff
heard
a
dapper
in
a
linen
duster
say
in
guarded
tones
to
a
woman
who
was
sifting
talcum
powder
into
her
collie
pup
s
fluffy
coat
over
at
bench
what
is
that
thing
a
dog
or
a
hippopotamus
as
the
woman
turned
to
observe
the
luckless
robin
jeff
titus
strolled
across
to
the
man
who
had
called
her
attention
to
the
dog
his
eyes
were
glinting
flares
behind
their
lowered
lids
and
his
lips
twisted
into
something
which
looked
like
a
smile
and
wasn
t
he
said
softly
beggin
s
pardon
mister
what
was
you
to
call
my
dawg
the
man
in
the
linen
duster
gave
one
glance
at
the
leathern
face
peering
down
so
intensely
into
his
then
shakily
he
made
reply
i
i
wasn
t
speaking
of
your
dog
sir
i
was
speaking
of
the
dog
in
the
next
bench
to
his
i
i
read
the
number
wrong
yours
is
a
a
grand
a
grand
collie
he
gulped
and
sped
down
the
aisles
on
a
errand
somewhere
jeff
turned
back
to
robin
his
mind
freed
of
its
momentary
angry
doubt
the
collie
classes
were
called
a
few
minutes
later
the
first
to
be
judged
were
as
usual
the
male
puppies
jeff
watching
the
performance
of
the
entrants
saw
how
the
judging
was
done
first
the
dogs
were
made
to
march
around
the
ring
then
in
ones
or
twos
they
were
placed
on
the
platform
while
the
little
judge
studied
them
and
felt
them
all
over
after
that
the
judge
wrote
certain
numbers
in
the
s
book
and
handed
to
the
owner
of
the
winning
dog
a
blue
ribbon
a
red
ribbon
went
to
the
owner
of
the
second
best
a
yellow
ribbon
to
the
third
and
a
white
ribbon
to
the
fourth
every
one
of
the
several
collie
classes
it
seemed
must
be
judged
in
that
same
deliberate
way
before
the
winners
of
all
classes
could
compete
for
a
rosette
whose
acquisition
meant
also
the
winning
of
the
silver
cup
jeff
began
to
chafe
at
the
needless
delay
which
must
ensue
before
robin
could
receive
his
merited
prize
then
directly
after
the
judging
of
the
puppies
came
the
novice
class
along
with
only
two
other
entries
jeff
titus
led
the
majestically
unconcerned
robin
into
the
ring
as
he
passed
a
titter
swept
the
quadruple
line
of
railbirds
outside
the
inclosure
jeff
did
not
so
much
as
look
about
him
to
locate
the
cause
of
the
mirth
these
fool
were
always
laughing
at
nothing
nor
did
he
note
the
glare
almost
of
horror
which
the
little
judge
bestowed
upon
robin
as
eve
s
adored
pet
paced
into
the
ring
the
judge
eyed
him
with
much
the
expression
one
might
expect
to
see
in
the
visage
of
a
supreme
court
justice
who
has
been
asked
to
hand
down
an
official
opinion
on
a
nursery
rhyme
walk
your
dogs
please
rasped
the
judge
the
parade
started
robin
strolled
unconcernedly
at
his
lanky
master
s
side
as
he
was
not
a
thoroughbred
his
nerves
were
not
of
the
order
the
racket
and
the
crowd
and
the
new
surroundings
did
not
excite
or
terrify
or
make
him
profoundly
miserable
as
they
did
some
of
the
collies
about
him
jeff
observed
this
calm
demeanour
and
was
proud
of
his
dog
s
bearing
the
parade
was
halted
the
judge
motioned
robin
s
two
competitors
to
the
platform
squinted
at
them
for
a
moment
ran
his
hand
over
them
examined
the
spring
of
their
ribs
then
their
teeth
and
various
other
details
stood
back
and
studied
them
then
handed
to
the
owner
of
one
a
blue
ribbon
and
to
the
other
a
red
the
yellow
ribbon
he
tossed
back
onto
the
steward
s
table
the
winners
of
the
first
and
second
prizes
departed
with
their
collies
the
steward
chalked
up
the
next
class
on
the
blackboard
but
jeff
titus
did
not
leave
the
ring
eyes
bulging
cheeks
slowly
turning
from
tan
to
he
strode
over
to
the
judge
you
he
rumbled
in
a
blend
of
wrath
and
dazed
incredulity
what
s
the
meanin
of

aimin
to
doublecross

of

he
with
much
dignity
the
little
judge
turned
his
back
on
the
angry
titus
and
started
across
the
ring
but
before
he
had
gone
two
steps
jeff
was
once
more
confronting
him
snarled
titus
again
striving
to
keep
himself
in
hand
i
ain
t
goin
to
lay
down
under
no
you
judged
crooked
with
my
dawg
i
c
n
prove
it
even
if
you
didn
t
have
the
sense
to
see
he
was
the
best
of
the
hull
bilin
you
was
bound
anyhow
to
give
him
the
yaller
ribbon
fer
third
prize
an
i
was
bound
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
rapped
out
the
exasperated
judge
i
am
here
to
judge
collies
not
dinosaurs
i
refuse
to
countenance
the
claim
that
your
dog
is
a
collie
by
giving
him
a
ribbon
even
in
a
class
of
three
so
in
this
class
i
have
deliberately
withheld
the
third
prize
your
dog
is
not
a
collie
the
lord
alone
knows
what
he
is
but
he
s
no
collie
that
s
all
clear
out
for
a
man
with
heart
or
imagination
there
is
no
ordeal
more
irksome
than
to
judge
dogs
for
in
almost
every
division
there
is
some
such
beast
as
robin
adair
a
dog
loved
by
his
owners
who
know
nothing
of
shows
or
of
show
points
a
judge
in
fairness
to
the
better
exhibits
must
pass
over
these
poor
animals
and
thereby
must
cause
heartache
and
shame
to
their
pathetic
owners
it
is
not
a
pleasant
task
nor
is
any
phase
of
pleasant
it
is
a
thankless
and
job
at
best
and
it
has
a
magic
quality
of
turning
one
s
friends
into
enemies
the
little
judge
at
the
duneka
show
was
hardened
by
long
practice
also
he
had
all
the
bristling
pluck
of
a
and
he
needed
it
in
facing
this
lean
giant
in
whose
the
was
beginning
to
smoulder
jeff
half
extended
one
windmill
arm
in
the
general
direction
of
the
judge
s
throat
then
he
checked
himself
it
was
going
to
be
bad
enough
to
slink
home
with
no
cup
but
it
would
be
worse
to
go
to
the
hoosgow
for
mayhem
he
pictured
sick
eve
s
grief
over
such
a
disgrace
and
his
clenched
hand
dropped
again
to
his
side
grappling
with
his
temper
the
mountaineer
wheeled
about
and
led
the
disqualified
robin
out
of
the
ring
and
back
to
the
bench
a
sweet
mess
he
had
made
of
everything
he
and
that
parson
up
yonder
they
had
wrought
on
eve
s
hopes
and
had
made
her
so
gloriously
confident
that
her
dear
dog
was
going
to
sweep
all
before
him
and
win
the
cup
she
was
lying
at
home
this
minute
her
big
eyes
shining
with
anticipation
her
vivid
mind
picturing
the
at
the
show
how
confidently
she
would
be
waiting
for
that
cup
jeff
had
sought
so
enthusiastically
to
work
out
stair
s
theory
of
a
good
news
cure
and
how
was
the
experiment
to
result
he
must
go
home
on
the
morrow
and
tell
eve
not
only
that
he
had
no
cup
to
show
her
but
that
the
judge
had
actually
refused
robin
a
ribbon
on
the
ground
that
the
dog
was
a
mongrel
what
effect
was
that
news
going
to
have
on
a
sick
woman
whose
swift
recovery
depended
on
her
spirits
knowing
eve
as
he
did
jeff
was
ready
to
believe
it
would
undo
most
of
her
convalescence
and
at
the
very
least
in
her
weak
state
it
was
certain
to
make
her
cry
jeff
would
rather
have
faced
a
nest
than
make
his
gallant
little
sweetheart
cry
he
began
to
swear
very
softly
but
very
very
zealously
and
then
his
resourceful
mountaineer
brain
unlimbered
and
went
into
action
presently
he
arose
from
the
bench
patted
robin
absentmindedly
on
the
head
and
slouched
off
towards
the
end
of
the
hall
where
in
a
high
glass
case
were
displayed
the
prize
cups
and
the
other
trophies
long
and
minutely
he
scanned
the
glittering
prizes
especially
the
cup
engraved
best
and
he
spelled
out
the
printed
legend
over
the
case
which
proclaimed
that
the
cups
were
supplied
by
the
jewellery
firm
of
pinkus
bernstein
of
republic
street
duneka
kentucky
ten
minutes
later
leaving
robin
to
shift
for
himself
on
his
bench
jeff
was
hiking
towards
the
business
streets
of
the
mountain
metropolis
he
paused
for
a
space
at
the
bank
where
he
had
a
carefully
little
account
and
he
drew
forth
a
goodly
share
of
that
sum
then
he
made
his
way
to
the
after
a
of
dickering
he
emerged
from
the
shop
bearing
a
bumpy
parcel
returning
to
the
agricultural
hall
he
seated
himself
once
more
on
the
narrow
bench
beside
the
exultantly
welcoming
robin
and
proceeded
to
unwind
the
tissue
wrappings
of
his
package
robin
looked
on
in
mild
curiosity
his
sense
of
smell
had
already
told
the
dog
that
the
parcel
contained
nothing
of
vital
interest
to
him
yet
because
he
had
been
lonely
and
a
little
worried
by
jeff
s
long
absence
robin
evinced
a
polite
concern
in
the
undoing
of
the
wrappings
the
last
layer
of
paper
was
removed
to
the
dog
s
view
was
exposed
a
huge
and
gleaming
silver
cup
a
cup
with
much
chasing
on
its
polished
surface
and
with
three
handles
and
an
ebony
base
it
was
at
least
double
the
size
of
the
cup
offered
by
the
committee
for
best
see
that
questioned
titus
holding
the
trophy
aloft
for
robin
s
inspection
dollars
that
set
me
back
an
it
d

been
a
heap
more
only
it
was

he
paused
in
his
confidence
to
the
blinking
sympathising
dog
two
men
had
halted
just
in
front
of
him
one
of
them
was
carrying
an
apparatus
which
memories
told
jeff
was
a
camera
it
chanced
to
be
a
moment
when
no
less
than
two
winners
classes
were
on
in
the
showrings
accordingly
the
were
banked
deep
with
onlookers
and
this
secluded
section
of
the
aisles
was
almost
wholly
stripped
of
spectators
that
was
why
jeff
had
ventured
to
bring
forth
the
cup
from
its
wrappings
the
sight
of
the
two
keenly
interested
men
set
him
to
scowling
in
dire
embarrassment
the
chairman
of
the
committee
was
also
one
of
the
chief
stockholders
of
the
duneka
wherefore
the
dictum
had
gone
forth
to
the
that
the
show
was
to
be
played
up
big
in
both
morning
and
evening
editions
and
the
paper
s
best
descriptive
writer
one
graham
had
been
assigned
to
do
some
stuff
about
it
in
addition
to
the
sporting
editor
s
regulation
account
graham
was
a
good
reporter
and
he
had
a
genius
for
yarns
but
of
dogs
he
knew
little
and
of
he
knew
even
less
yet
gleaning
such
information
on
the
subject
as
he
could
he
had
set
forth
for
the
show
this
morning
taking
along
the
paper
s
sole
photographer
after
pausing
near
the
front
entrance
to
accustom
their
ears
to
the
frightful
din
and
to
take
a
snapshot
of
the
the
two
newspaper
men
had
wandered
down
the
first
aisle
into
which
their
feet
had
chanced
to
stray
there
suddenly
graham
saw
one
of
the
bits
for
which
he
was
always
hunting
midway
in
an
aisle
labelled
collie
section
sat
a
tired
man
a
typical
mountaineer
beside
a
huge
collie
and
to
the
civilly
interested
dog
the
mountaineer
was
exhibiting
pridefully
a
silver
cup
larger
than
any
in
the
he
was
talking
to
the
dog
too
in
a
confidential
whisper
evidently
telling
the
collie
what
a
splendid
victory
he
had
scored
and
how
proud
of
him
his
master
was
here
was
stuff
if
ever
graham
had
seen
it
cup
for
best
collie
in
the
show
asked
graham
of
the
scowling
yep
snapped
jeff
titus
defiantly
good
boy
exclaimed
graham
seeking
by
effusive
geniality
to
break
down
the
mountaineer
s
surly
reserve
he
s
sure
one
peach
of
a
dog
what
s
his
name
and
what
s
yours
his
name
said
jeff
with
perilous
courtesy
is
robin
robin
adair
he
b
longs
to
my
wife
miz

she

more
questions
to

me
with
b

would
you

holding
up
the
cup
a
second
wheedled
graham
scribbling
with
a
chewed
pencil
on
a
doubled
wad
of
copy
paper
so
thanks
still
defiantly
jeff
had
held
forward
the
cup
for
inspection
his
free
arm
around
the
majestic
robin
s
shoulders
the
camera
clicked
titus
did
not
hear
it
through
the
noise
of
a
hundred
barks
and
yelps
besides
he
was
focusing
his
indignant
attention
on
this
opponent
of
his
wal
he
demanded
truculently
anything
more
wants
o
me
he
s
dawg
an
he
s
good
enough
for
if
don
t
like
him
none
but
i
do
effused
graham
a
great
dog
titus
and
his
eye
running
along
the
collie
section
he
must
be
close
to
championship
standard
to
have
beaten
all
of
these
beauties
i
d
like
to
ask
you
i
ain
t
got
nothin
more
to
say
growled
jeff
half
rising
and
his
yellow
eyetooth
began
to
show
under
his
upcurling
lip
an
if
is
aimin
to
start
trouble
bout
this
yer
cup
graham
was
not
aiming
to
start
trouble
not
at
all
did
he
like
the
new
expression
nor
the
voice
of
this
sulking
he
had
sought
to
patronise
with
a
signal
to
the
photographer
he
moved
rapidly
away
continuing
his
progress
down
the
aisle
jeff
glared
after
him
if
the
man
were
going
to
inform
the
committee
that
titus
had
bought
a
cup
when
he
had
not
been
able
to
win
one
why
let
him
do
it
jeff
wasn
t
going
to
run
away
so
he
held
his
ground
feeling
very
wrathful
but
somewhat
scared
he
restored
the
cup
to
its
wrappings
it
would
be
handier
to
carry
it
that
way
should
he
be
ejected
from
the
show
on
account
of
his
fraud
but
no
one
ejected
him
except
that
people
paused
now
and
then
through
the
course
of
the
day
to
stare
amusedly
at
poor
robin
and
to
straighten
their
faces
in
comical
haste
as
they
encountered
jeff
s
glower
no
one
molested
titus
at
four
in
the
afternoon
jeff
s
raw
nerves
could
stand
the
strain
no
longer
untying
robin
from
the
bench
he
led
him
to
the
entrance
of
the
hall
there
he
sought
the
superintendent
of
the
show
when
c
n
me
an
my
dawg
git
outen
here
an
traipse
home
he
asked
no
dog
is
supposed
to
leave
the
building
before
ten
o
clock
when
the
show
ends
replied
the
superintendent
adding
with
a
cryptic
glance
at
robin
but
i
don
t
think
i
need
hold
your
entry
to
those
rules
go
when
you
the
cup
under
his
arm
and
robin
at
his
heels
jeff
departed
he
had
come
to
town
on
the
dog
running
alongside
even
at
the
best
pace
he
could
scarce
hope
to
get
home
very
much
before
midnight
he
had
come
to
duneka
on
the
preceding
day
and
had
planned
to
stay
until
next
morning
but
already
his
imagination
was
afire
with
the
thought
of
bursting
in
on
eve
that
very
night
with
the
glittering
trophy
so
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
stable
where
he
housed
his
mule
across
the
from
the
cityward
gate
a
bevy
of
barelegged
newsboys
was
scampering
with
armfuls
of
newspapers
copies
of
the
first
afternoon
edition
one
of
them
ran
past
jeff
jeff
s
keen
mountaineer
eyes
chanced
on
a
dark
blotch
near
the
bottom
of
the
swaying
sheet
s
first
page
with
an
unbelieving
gasp
he
stopped
short
in
his
tracks
and
bawled
to
the
fleeing
newsboy
to
come
back
the
boy
returned
holding
out
the
paper
jeff
snatched
it
from
him
riveting
his
incredulous
gaze
upon
that
dark
blotch
on
the
front
page
the
blotch
at
close
range
resolved
itself
into
a
cut
a
picture
of
robin
lying
majestically
at
full
length
in
his
bench
his
trustful
gaze
fixed
on
the
lank
man
who
squatted
beside
him
and
who
held
aloft
an
ornate
silver
cup
above
the
cut
ran
the
caption
a
and
his
beneath
the
picture
were
the
lines
jeff
titus
robin
adair
winner
of
cup
for
best
collie
in
doubled
in
space
under
this
was
one
of
the
stories
with
which
graham
was
wont
to
strew
the
pages
jeff
s
fascinated
eyes
tore
themselves
from
the
picture
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
own
name
midway
of
this
explanatory
yarn
he
read
the
sentence
containing
the
name
then
the
next
line
or
so
slowly
and
painfully
he
spelled
out
titus
exhibited
the
dog
for
his
wife
who
is
ill
at
their
keytesville
home
with
characteristic
mountaineer
modesty
titus
refused
to
sound
his
splendid
exhibit
s
praises
when
congratulated
by
throngs
of
admirers
who
paid
homage
to
the
peerless
robin
adair
titus
sole
comment
on
robin
s
sensational
victory
was
he
s
good
enough
for
us
robin
adair
was
good
enough
for
the
judges
too
and
good
enough
to
win
over
one
of
the
finest
aggregations
of
collies
ever
shown
in
this
part
of
the
south
the
brief
story
switched
back
to
the
note
to
the
man
s
evident
rapture
in
the
triumph
of
his
sick
wife
s
pet
and
his
shy
pride
in
the
magnificent
cup
but
jeff
read
no
more
just
then
whirling
on
the
impatiently
waiting
newsboy
he
demanded
thickly
gim
me
all
them
newspapers
you
re
totin
an
then
scuttle
off
an
fetch
me
a
dozen
more
scat
again
he
stared
in
idiotic
bliss
at
the
smudged
cut
what
did
it
matter
to
jeff
titus
that
the
picture
and
its
erroneous
caption
were
to
be
lifted
out
of
the
next
edition
and
that
graham
was
to
incur
the
sharpest
of
his
career
for
the
break
he
had
made
not
three
copies
of
the
a
week
made
their
way
to
keytesville
and
even
should
the
next
day
s
full
account
of
the
reach
the
titus
region
no
mountaineer
in
the
state
would
possess
the
technical
to
decipher
the
cryptic
summary
of
wins
and
thus
learn
of
robin
s
defeat
no
in
the
mountains
the
printed
word
was
accepted
as
gospel
fact
by
those
who
had
education
to
read
it
and
its
pictures
were
accepted
as
such
by
those
who
had
not
bothered
to
master
the
effete
arts
of
reading
and
writing
jeff
was
going
to
take
home
enough
papers
to
go
around
the
whole
sparse
neighbourhood
in
addition
to
those
which
were
to
be
mailed
to
eve
s
people
at
louisville
and
to
any
other
distant
kin
or
friends
of
hers
not
in
the
very
least
did
jeff
titus
understand
the
meaning
of
this
newspaper
tribute
nor
did
he
bother
his
overwrought
brain
about
it
he
had
the
required
good
news
for
eve
he
had
printed
and
pictured
proofs
thereof

mother
lady
nor
was
he
like
them
in
any
other
way
except
that
he
inherited
old
lad
s
staunchly
gallant
spirit
and
loyalty
and
uncanny
brain
no
in
traits
as
well
as
in
looks
he
was
more
wolf
than
dog
he
almost
never
barked
his
snarl
supplying
all
vocal
needs
the
mistress
or
the
master
or
the
boy
any
of
these
three
could
romp
with
him
roll
him
over
tickle
him
or
subject
him
to
all
sorts
of
playful
indignities
and
wolf
entered
gleefully
into
the
fun
of
the
romp
but
let
any
human
besides
these
three
lay
a
hand
on
his
slender
body
and
a
snarling
plunge
for
the
offender
s
throat
was
wolf
s
invariable
reply
to
the
caress
it
had
been
so
since
his
puppyhood
he
did
not
fly
at
accredited
guests
nor
indeed
pay
any
heed
to
their
presence
so
long
as
they
kept
their
hands
off
him
but
to
all
of
these
the
boy
was
forced
to
say
at
the
very
outset
of
the
visit
pat
lad
and
bruce
all
you
want
to
but
please
leave
wolf
alone
he
doesn
t
care
for
people
we
ve
taught
him
to
stand
for
a
pat
on
the
head
from
guests
but
don
t
touch
his
then
to
prove
his
own
immunity
the
boy
would
proceed
to
tumble
wolf
about
to
the
delight
of
them
both
in
romping
with
humans
whom
they
love
most
dogs
will
bite
more
or
less
gently
or
pretend
to
bite
as
a
part
of
the
game
wolf
never
did
this
in
his
wildest
and
roughest
romps
with
the
boy
or
with
the
boy
s
parents
wolf
did
not
so
much
as
open
his
mighty
jaws
perhaps
because
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
bite
gently
perhaps
because
he
realised
that
a
bite
is
not
a
joke
but
an
effort
to
kill
there
had
been
only
one
exception
to
wolf
s
hatred
for
mauling
at
strangers
hands
a
man
came
to
the
place
on
a
business
call
bringing
along
a
chubby
daughter
the
master
warned
the
baby
that
she
must
not
go
near
wolf
although
she
might
pet
any
of
the
other
collies
then
he
became
so
much
interested
in
the
business
talk
that
he
and
his
guest
forgot
all
about
the
child
ten
minutes
later
the
master
chanced
to
shift
his
gaze
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
he
broke
off
with
a
gasp
in
the
very
middle
of
a
sentence
the
baby
was
seated
astride
wolf
s
back
her
tiny
heels
digging
into
the
dog
s
sensitive
ribs
and
each
of
her
chubby
fists
gripping
one
of
his
ears
wolf
was
lying
there
with
an
idiotically
happy
grin
on
his
face
and
wagging
his
tail
in
ecstasy
no
one
knew
why
he
had
submitted
to
the
baby
s
tugging
hands
except
because
she
a
baby
and
because
the
gallant
heart
of
the
dog
had
gone
out
to
her
helplessness
wolf
was
the
official
of
the
place
and
his
name
carried
dread
to
the
loafers
and
tramps
of
the
region
also
he
was
the
boy
s
own
special
dog
he
had
been
born
on
the
boy
s
tenth
birthday
five
years
before
this
story
of
ours
begins
and
ever
since
then
the
two
had
been
inseparable
chums
one
sloppy
afternoon
in
late
winter
wolf
and
the
boy
were
sprawled
side
by
side
on
the
fur
rug
in
front
of
the
library
fire
the
mistress
and
the
master
had
gone
to
town
for
the
day
the
house
was
lonely
and
the
two
chums
were
left
to
entertain
each
other
the
boy
was
reading
a
magazine
the
dog
beside
him
was
blinking
in
drowsy
comfort
at
the
fire
presently
finishing
the
story
he
had
been
reading
the
boy
looked
across
at
the
sleepy
dog
wolf
he
said
here
s
a
story
about
a
dog
i
think
he
must
have
been
something
like
you
maybe
he
was
your
he
lived
an
awfully
long
time
ago
in
pompeii
ever
hear
of
pompeii
now
the
boy
was
fifteen
years
old
and
he
had
too
much
sense
to
imagine
that
wolf
could
possibly
understand
the
story
he
was
about
to
tell
him
but
long
since
he
had
fallen
into
a
way
of
talking
to
his
dog
sometimes
as
if
to
another
human
it
was
fun
for
him
to
note
the
almost
pathetic
eagerness
wherewith
wolf
listened
and
tried
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
what
he
was
saying
again
and
again
at
sound
of
some
familiar
word
or
voice
inflection
the
collie
would
pick
up
his
ears
or
wag
his
tail
as
if
in
the
joyous
hope
that
he
had
at
last
found
a
clue
to
his
owner
s
meaning
you
see
went
on
the
boy
this
dog
lived
in
pompeii
as
i
told
you
you
ve
never
been
there
wolf
was
looking
up
at
the
boy
in
wistful
excitement
seeking
vainly
to
guess
what
was
expected
of
him
and
continued
the
boy
the
kid
who
owned
him
seems
to
have
had
a
regular
knack
for
getting
into
trouble
all
the
time
and
his
dog
was
always
on
hand
to
get
him
out
of
it
it
s
a
true
story
the
magazine
says
the
kid
s
father
was
so
grateful
to
the
dog
that
he
bought
him
a
solid
silver
collar
solid
silver
get
that
wolfie
wolf
did
not
get
but
he
wagged
his
tail
hopefully
his
eyes
alight
with
bewildered
interest
and
said
the
boy
what
do
you
suppose
was
engraved
on
the
collar
well
i
ll
tell
you
dog
has
thrice
saved
his
little
master
from
death
once
by
fire
once
by
flood
and
once
at
the
hands
of
robbers
how
s
that
for
a
record
wolf
for
dog
too
at
the
words
wolf
and
dog
the
collie
s
tail
smote
the
floor
in
glad
comprehension
then
he
edged
closer
to
the
boy
as
the
narrator
s
voice
presently
took
on
a
sadder
note
but
at
last
resumed
the
boy
there
came
a
time
when
the
dog
couldn
t
save
the
kid
mount
vesuvius
erupted
all
the
sky
was
as
black
as
midnight
and
pompeii
was
buried
under
lava
and
ashes
the
dog
could
easily
have
got
away
by
himself
dogs
can
see
in
the
dark
can
t
they
wolf
but
he
couldn
t
get
the
kid
away
and
he
wouldn
t
go
without
him
you
wouldn
t
have
gone
without
me
either
would
you
wolf
pretty
nearly
two
thousand
years
later
some
people
dug
through
the
lava
that
covered
pompeii
what
do
you
suppose
they
found
of
course
they
found
a
whole
lot
of
things
one
of
them
was
that
dog
silver
collar
and
inscription
and
all
he
was
lying
at
the
feet
of
a
child
the
child
he
couldn
t
save
he
was
one
grand
dog
hey
wolf
the
continued
strain
of
trying
to
understand
began
to
get
on
the
collie
s
nerves
he
rose
to
his
feet
quivering
and
sought
to
lick
the
boy
s
face
thrusting
one
upraised
white
forepaw
at
him
in
appeal
for
a
handshake
the
boy
slammed
shut
the
magazine
it
s
slow
in
the
house
here
with
nothing
to
do
he
said
to
his
chum
i
m
going
up
the
lake
with
my
gun
to
see
if
any
wild
ducks
have
landed
in
the
marshes
yet
it
s
almost
time
for
them
want
to
come
along
the
last
sentence
wolf
understood
perfectly
on
the
instant
he
was
dancing
with
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
a
walk
being
a
collie
he
was
of
no
earthly
help
in
a
but
on
such
tramps
as
everywhere
else
he
was
the
boy
s
inseparable
companion
out
over
the
slushy
snow
the
two
started
the
boy
with
his
light
shotgun
slung
over
one
shoulder
the
dog
trotting
close
at
his
heels
the
march
thaw
was
changing
to
a
sharp
freeze
the
deep
and
soggy
snow
was
crusted
over
just
thick
enough
to
make
walking
a
genuine
difficulty
for
both
dog
and
boy
the
place
was
a
promontory
that
ran
out
into
the
lake
on
the
opposite
bank
from
the
village
behind
across
the
highroad
lay
the
forest
at
the
lake
s
northerly
end
two
miles
beyond
the
place
were
the
reedy
marshes
where
a
month
hence
wild
duck
would
congregate
thither
with
wolf
the
boy
ploughed
his
way
through
the
biting
cold
the
going
was
heavy
and
heavier
a
below
the
marshes
the
boy
struck
out
across
the
upper
corner
of
the
lake
here
the
ice
was
rotten
at
the
top
where
the
thaw
had
nibbled
at
it
but
beneath
it
was
still
a
full
eight
inches
thick
easily
strong
enough
to
bear
the
boy
s
weight
along
the
grey
the
two
plodded
the
skim
of
water
which
the
thaw
had
spread
an
inch
thick
over
the
ice
had
frozen
in
the
day
s
cold
spell
it
crackled
like
broken
glass
as
the
chums
walked
over
it
the
boy
had
on
big
so
apart
from
the
extra
effort
the
ice
did
not
bother
him
to
wolf
it
gave
acute
pain
the
sharp
particles
were
forever
getting
between
the
callous
black
pads
of
his
feet
pricking
and
cutting
him
acutely
little
smears
of
blood
began
to
mark
the
dog
s
course
but
it
never
occurred
to
wolf
to
turn
back
or
to
betray
by
any
sign
that
he
was
suffering
it
was
all
a
part
of
the
day
s
work
a
cheap
price
to
pay
for
the
joy
of
tramping
with
his
adored
young
master
then
forty
yards
or
so
on
the
hither
side
of
the
marshes
wolf
beheld
a
right
amazing
phenomenon
the
boy
had
been
walking
directly
in
front
of
him
gun
over
shoulder
with
no
warning
at
all
the
youthful
hunter
fell
feet
foremost
out
of
sight
through
the
ice
the
light
shell
of
water
that
covered
the
lake
s
thicker
ice
also
masked
an
nearly
three
feet
wide
into
this
as
he
strode
carelessly
along
the
boy
had
stepped
straight
down
he
had
gone
with
all
the
force
of
his
pounds
and
with
all
the
impetus
of
his
forward
stride
instinctively
he
threw
out
his
hands
to
restore
his
balance
the
only
effect
of
this
was
to
send
the
gun
flying
ten
feet
away
down
went
the
boy
through
less
than
three
feet
of
water
for
the
bottom
of
the
lake
at
this
point
had
started
to
slope
upward
towards
the
marshes
and
through
nearly
two
feet
more
of
sticky
marsh
mud
that
underlay
the
his
outflung
hands
struck
against
the
ice
on
the
edges
of
the
and
clung
there
sputtering
and
gurgling
the
boy
brought
his
head
above
the
surface
and
tried
to
raise
himself
by
his
hands
high
enough
to
wriggle
out
upon
the
surface
of
the
ice
ordinarily
this
would
have
been
simple
enough
for
so
strong
a
lad
but
the
mud
had
imprisoned
his
feet
and
the
lower
part
of
his
legs
and
held
them
powerless
try
as
he
would
the
boy
could
not
wrench
himself
free
of
the
slough
the
water
as
he
stood
upright
was
on
a
level
with
his
mouth
the
was
too
wide
for
him
at
such
a
depth
to
get
a
good
purchase
on
its
edges
and
lift
himself
bodily
to
safety
gaining
such
a
as
he
could
he
heaved
with
all
his
might
throwing
every
muscle
of
his
body
into
the
struggle
one
leg
was
pulled
almost
free
of
the
mud
but
the
other
was
driven
deeper
into
it
and
as
the
boy
s
fingers
slipped
from
the
smoothly
wet
the
attempt
to
restore
his
balance
drove
the
free
leg
back
into
the
mire
ten
minutes
of
this
hopeless
fighting
left
the
boy
panting
and
tired
out
the
icy
water
was
numbing
his
nerves
and
chilling
his
blood
into
torpidity
his
hands
were
without
sense
of
feeling
as
far
up
as
the
wrists
even
if
he
could
have
shaken
free
his
legs
from
the
mud
now
he
had
not
strength
enough
left
to
crawl
out
of
the
hole
he
ceased
his
uselessly
frantic
battle
and
stood
dazed
then
he
came
sharply
to
himself
for
as
he
stood
the
water
crept
upward
from
his
lips
to
his
nostrils
he
knew
why
the
water
seemed
to
be
rising
it
was
not
rising
it
was
he
who
was
sinking
as
soon
as
he
stopped
moving
the
mud
began
very
slowly
but
very
steadily
to
suck
him
downward
this
was
not
a
quicksand
but
it
was
a
deep
and
only
by
constant
motion
could
he
avoid
sinking
farther
and
farther
down
into
it
he
had
less
than
two
inches
to
spare
at
best
before
the
water
should
fill
his
nostrils
less
than
two
inches
of
life
even
if
he
could
keep
the
water
down
to
the
level
of
his
lips
there
was
a
moment
of
utter
panic
then
the
boy
s
brain
cleared
his
only
hope
was
to
keep
on
fighting
to
rest
when
he
must
for
a
moment
or
so
and
then
to
renew
his
numbed
grip
on
the
and
try
to
pull
his
feet
a
few
inches
higher
out
of
the
mud
he
must
do
this
as
long
as
his
chilled
body
could
be
scourged
into
obeying
his
will
he
struggled
again
but
with
virtually
no
result
in
raising
himself
a
second
struggle
however
brought
him
above
the
water
he
remembered
confusedly
that
some
of
these
earlier
struggles
had
scarce
budged
him
while
others
had
gained
him
two
or
three
inches
vaguely
he
wondered
why
then
turning
his
head
he
realised
wolf
as
he
turned
was
just
loosing
his
hold
on
the
wide
collar
of
the
boy
s
mackinaw
his
cut
forepaws
were
still
braced
against
a
flaw
of
ragged
ice
on
the
s
edge
and
all
his
tawny
body
was
tense
his
body
was
dripping
wet
too
the
boy
noted
that
and
he
realised
that
the
repeated
effort
to
draw
his
master
to
safety
must
have
resulted
at
least
once
in
pulling
the
dog
down
into
the
water
with
the
floundering
boy
once
more
wolfie
more
chattered
the
boy
through
teeth
that
clicked
together
like
castanets
the
dog
darted
forward
caught
his
grip
afresh
on
the
edge
of
the
boy
s
collar
and
tugged
with
all
his
fierce
strength
growling
and
whining
ferociously
the
while
the
boy
seconded
the
collie
s
tuggings
by
a
supreme
struggle
that
lifted
him
higher
than
before
he
was
able
to
get
one
arm
and
shoulder
clear
his
numb
fingers
closed
about
an
upthrust
which
had
been
washed
down
stream
in
the
autumn
freshets
and
had
been
frozen
into
the
lake
ice
with
this
new
purchase
and
aided
by
the
dog
the
boy
tried
to
drag
himself
out
of
the
hole
but
the
chill
of
the
water
had
done
its
work
he
had
not
the
strength
to
move
farther
the
mud
still
sucked
at
his
calves
and
ankles
the
big
were
full
of
water
that
seemed
to
weigh
a
ton
he
lay
there
gasping
and
chattering
then
through
the
gathering
twilight
his
eyes
fell
on
the
gun
lying
ten
feet
away
wolf
he
ordered
nodding
towards
the
weapon
get
it
it
not
in
vain
had
the
boy
talked
to
wolf
for
years
as
if
the
dog
were
human
at
the
words
and
the
nod
the
collie
trotted
over
to
the
gun
lifted
it
by
the
stock
and
hauled
it
awkwardly
along
over
the
bumpy
ice
to
his
master
where
he
laid
it
down
at
the
edge
of
the
the
dog
s
eyes
were
cloudy
with
trouble
and
he
shivered
and
whined
as
with
ague
the
water
on
his
thick
coat
was
freezing
to
a
mass
of
ice
but
it
was
from
anxiety
that
he
shivered
and
not
from
cold
still
keeping
his
numb
grasp
on
the
the
boy
balanced
himself
as
best
he
could
and
thrust
two
fingers
of
his
free
hand
into
his
mouth
to
warm
them
into
sensation
again
when
this
was
done
he
reached
out
to
where
the
gun
lay
and
pulled
its
trigger
the
shot
boomed
deafeningly
through
the
twilight
winter
silences
the
recoil
sent
the
weapon
sliding
sharply
back
along
the
ice
spraining
the
boy
s
trigger
finger
and
cutting
it
to
the
bone
that
s
all
i
can
do
said
the
boy
to
himself
if
anyone
hears
it
well
and
good
i
can
t
get
at
another
cartridge
i
couldn
t
put
it
into
the
breech
if
i
had
it
my
hands
are
too
for
several
endless
minutes
he
clung
there
listening
but
this
was
a
desolate
part
of
the
lake
far
from
any
road
and
the
season
was
too
early
for
other
hunters
to
be
abroad
the
bitter
cold
in
any
case
tended
to
make
sane
folk
hug
the
fireside
rather
than
to
venture
so
far
into
the
open
nor
was
the
single
report
of
a
gun
uncommon
enough
to
call
for
investigation
in
such
weather
all
this
the
boy
told
himself
as
the
minutes
dragged
by
then
he
looked
again
at
wolf
the
dog
head
on
one
side
still
stood
protectingly
above
him
the
dog
was
cold
and
in
pain
but
being
only
a
dog
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
trot
off
home
to
the
comfort
of
the
library
fire
and
leave
his
master
to
fend
for
himself
presently
with
a
little
sigh
wolf
lay
down
on
the
ice
his
nose
across
the
boy
s
arm
even
if
he
lacked
strength
to
save
his
beloved
master
he
could
stay
and
share
the
boy
s
sufferings
but
the
boy
himself
thought
otherwise
he
was
not
at
all
minded
to
freeze
to
death
nor
was
he
willing
to
let
wolf
imitate
the
dog
of
pompeii
by
dying
helplessly
at
his
master
s
side
controlling
for
an
instant
the
chattering
of
his
teeth
he
called
wolf
the
dog
was
on
his
feet
again
at
the
word
alert
eager
wolf
repeated
the
boy
hear
me
he
pointed
homeward
wolf
stared
at
him
hesitant
again
the
boy
called
in
vehement
command
the
collie
lifted
his
head
to
the
twilight
sky
with
a
hideous
in
its
grief
and
appeal
a
howl
as
wild
and
discordant
as
that
of
any
of
his
savage
ancestors
then
stooping
first
to
lick
the
numb
hand
that
clung
to
the
branch
wolf
turned
and
fled
across
the
cruelly
sharp
film
of
ice
he
tore
at
top
speed
head
down
whirling
through
the
deepening
dusk
like
a
flash
of
tawny
light
wolf
understood
what
was
wanted
of
him
wolf
always
understood
the
pain
in
his
feet
was
as
nothing
the
stiffness
of
his
numbed
body
was
forgotten
in
the
urgency
for
speed
the
boy
looked
drearily
after
the
figure
which
the
dusk
was
swallowing
he
knew
the
dog
would
try
to
bring
help
as
has
many
another
and
lesser
dog
in
times
of
need
whether
or
not
that
help
could
arrive
in
time
or
at
all
was
a
point
on
which
the
boy
would
not
let
himself
dwell
into
his
benumbed
brain
crept
the
memory
of
an
old
norse
proverb
he
had
read
in
school
consists
in
hanging
on
one
minute
unconsciously
he
tightened
his
feeble
hold
on
the
and
braced
himself
from
the
marshes
to
the
place
was
a
full
two
miles
despite
the
deep
and
sticky
snow
wolf
covered
the
distance
in
less
than
nine
minutes
he
paused
in
front
of
the
at
the
highway
entrance
to
the
drive
but
the
superintendent
and
his
wife
had
gone
to
paterson
shopping
that
afternoon
down
the
drive
to
the
house
he
dashed
the
maids
had
taken
advantage
of
their
employers
day
in
new
york
to
walk
across
the
lake
to
the
village
to
a
show
wise
men
claim
that
dogs
have
not
the
power
to
think
or
to
reason
things
out
in
a
logical
way
so
perhaps
it
was
mere
chance
that
next
sent
wolf
s
flying
feet
across
the
lake
to
the
village
perhaps
it
was
chance
and
not
the
knowledge
that
where
there
is
a
village
there
are
people
again
and
again
in
the
car
he
had
sat
upon
the
front
seat
alongside
the
mistress
when
she
drove
to
the
station
to
meet
guests
there
were
always
people
at
the
station
and
to
the
station
wolf
now
raced
the
usual
group
of
platform
idlers
had
been
dispersed
by
the
cold
a
solitary
baggageman
was
hauling
a
trunk
and
some
boxes
out
of
the
on
to
the
platform
to
be
put
aboard
the
five
o
clock
train
from
new
york
as
the
baggageman
passed
under
the
clump
of
station
lights
he
came
to
a
sudden
halt
for
out
of
the
darkness
dashed
a
dog
full
tilt
the
animal
rushed
up
to
him
and
seized
him
by
the
skirt
of
the
overcoat
the
man
cried
out
in
scared
surprise
he
dropped
the
box
he
was
carrying
and
struck
at
the
dog
to
ward
off
the
seemingly
murderous
attack
he
recognised
wolf
and
he
knew
the
collie
s
repute
but
wolf
was
not
attacking
holding
tight
to
the
he
backed
away
trying
to
draw
the
man
with
him
and
all
the
while
whimpering
aloud
like
a
nervous
puppy
a
kick
from
the
boot
broke
the
dog
s
hold
on
the
even
as
a
second
yell
from
the
man
brought
four
or
five
other
people
running
out
from
the
station
waitingroom
one
of
these
the
telegraph
operator
took
in
the
scene
at
a
single
glance
with
great
presence
of
mind
he
bawled
loudly
mad
dog
this
as
wolf
reeling
from
the
kick
sought
to
gain
another
grip
on
the
a
second
kick
sent
him
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
tracks
while
other
voices
took
up
the
panic
cry
of
mad
dog
now
a
mad
dog
is
supposed
to
be
a
dog
afflicted
by
rabies
once
in
ten
thousand
times
at
the
very
most
a
is
justified
certainly
not
oftener
a
harmless
and
friendly
dog
loses
his
master
on
the
street
he
runs
about
confused
and
frightened
looking
for
the
owner
he
has
lost
a
boy
throws
a
stone
at
him
other
boys
chase
him
his
tongue
hangs
out
and
his
eyes
glaze
with
terror
then
some
fool
bellows
mad
dog
and
the
cruel
chase
is
on
a
chase
that
ends
in
the
pitiful
victim
s
death
yes
in
every
crowd
there
is
a
voice
ready
to
raise
that
asinine
and
murderously
cruel
shout
so
it
was
with
the
men
who
witnessed
wolf
s
frenzied
effort
to
take
aid
to
the
imperilled
boy
voice
after
voice
repeated
the
cry
men
groped
along
the
platform
edge
for
stones
to
throw
the
village
policeman
ran
puffingly
upon
the
scene
drawing
his
revolver
finding
it
useless
to
make
a
further
attempt
to
drag
the
baggageman
to
the
rescue
wolf
leaped
back
facing
the
ever
larger
group
back
went
his
head
again
in
that
hideous
then
he
galloped
away
a
few
yards
trotted
back
howled
once
more
and
again
galloped
lakeward
all
of
which
only
confirmed
the
panicky
crowd
in
the
belief
that
they
were
threatened
by
a
mad
dog
a
shower
of
stones
hurtled
about
wolf
as
he
came
back
a
third
time
to
lure
these
dull
humans
into
following
him
one
pointed
rock
smote
the
collie
s
shoulder
glancingly
cutting
it
to
the
bone
a
shot
from
the
policeman
s
revolver
fanned
the
fur
of
his
ruff
as
it
whizzed
past
knowing
that
he
faced
death
he
nevertheless
stood
his
ground
not
troubling
to
dodge
the
fusillade
of
stones
but
continuing
to
run
lakeward
and
then
trot
back
whining
with
excitement
a
second
flew
wide
a
third
grazed
the
dog
s
hip
from
all
directions
people
were
running
towards
the
station
a
man
darted
into
a
house
next
door
and
emerged
carrying
a
shotgun
this
he
steadied
on
the
not
forty
feet
away
from
the
leaping
dog
and
made
ready
to
fire
it
was
then
the
train
from
new
york
came
in
and
momentarily
the
sport
of
killing
was
abandoned
while
the
crowd
scattered
to
each
side
of
the
track
from
a
front
car
of
the
train
the
mistress
and
the
master
emerged
into
a
bedlam
of
noise
and
confusion
best
hide
in
the
station
ma
am
shouted
the
telegraph
operator
at
sight
of
the
mistress
there
is
a
mad
dog
loose
out
here
he
s
chasing
folks
around
and
mad
dog
repeated
the
mistress
in
high
contempt
if
you
knew
anything
about
dogs
you
d
know
mad
ones
never
chase
folks
around
any
more
than
diphtheria
patients
do
then
a
flash
of
tawny
light
beneath
the
station
lamp
a
scurrying
of
frightened
idlers
a
final
wasted
shot
from
the
policeman
s
pistol
as
wolf
dived
headlong
through
the
frightened
crowd
towards
the
voice
he
heard
and
recognised
up
to
the
mistress
and
the
master
galloped
wolf
he
was
bleeding
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
fur
was
rumpled
he
seized
the
astounded
master
s
gloved
hand
lightly
between
his
teeth
and
sought
to
pull
him
across
the
tracks
and
towards
the
lake
the
master
knew
dogs
especially
he
knew
wolf
and
without
a
word
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
the
mistress
and
one
or
two
inquisitive
men
followed
presently
wolf
loosed
his
hold
on
the
master
s
hand
and
ran
on
ahead
darting
back
every
few
moments
to
make
certain
he
was
followed
consists
in
hanging
on
one
minute
the
boy
was
whispering
deliriously
to
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
as
wolf
pattered
up
to
him
in
triumph
across
the
ice
with
the
human
rescuers
a
scant
ten
yards
behind
the
foul
fancier
in
the
sixth
round
of
his
fight
with
kid
feltman
the
end
came
and
it
was
not
at
all
the
end
that
anybody
but
dan
rorke
and
keegan
his
manager
looked
for
for
the
outclassed
and
battered
and
wabbling
rorke
won
two
minutes
earlier
no
one
in
the
pastime
athletic
club
auditorium
would
have
bet
a
cancelled
lottery
ticket
on
rorke
s
chances
and
the
result
left
the
crowd
as
puzzled
as
was
the
raging
feltman
himself
no
rorke
did
not
see
one
sweet
face
in
the
throng
a
face
that
nerved
him
to
superhuman
effort
and
victory
nor
did
he
spur
himself
to
a
herculean
last
stand
that
won
him
the
fight
that
was
not
dan
rorke
s
way
and
most
assuredly
it
was
not
the
way
of
his
manager
and
mentor
red
keegan
the
victory
was
won
by
subtler
and
less
hackneyed
methods
here
in
brief
was
the
procedure
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
round
dan
had
slumped
back
to
his
corner
dizzy
and
gone
red
keegan
s
practised
eye
summed
up
his
condition
as
it
had
summed
up
his
chances
during
the
past
two
rounds
and
he
whispered
time
s
come
for
it
danny
boy
he
s
too
many
for
danny
boy
needed
no
further
amplifying
of
the
order
twenty
times
in
the
gym
under
keegan
s
shrewd
tutelage
he
had
rehearsed
what
now
he
was
about
to
do
rorke
rose
sluggishly
groggily
staggeringly
to
the
summons
for
the
sixth
round
he
swayed
drunkenly
towards
the
centre
of
the
ring
seeing
which
the
crowd
screeched
to
feltman
to
sail
in
and
finish
him
obligingly
feltman
prepared
to
obey
the
behest
of
his
patrons
he
took
no
chances
of
a
possible
trick
by
laying
himself
open
but
with
all
the
zest
that
could
include
caution
he
went
for
his
opponent
rorke
met
the
onslaught
right
gamely
he
called
on
all
his
waning
strength
for
one
last
desperate
rally
and
the
crowd
did
homage
to
his
gameness
by
howling
approval
feltman
was
a
wise
man
he
knew
this
false
burst
of
power
could
not
last
sooner
than
waste
himself
in
fighting
back
he
covered
and
waited
for
the
momentary
flash
to
burn
out
but
the
cheering
of
the
fickle
crowd
was
too
much
for
him
and
after
an
instant
of
blocking
and
retreating
he
met
the
pathetically
brief
rally
foot
to
foot
there
was
a
flurrying
exchange
of
blows
rorke
spinning
about
so
that
his
back
was
towards
the
referee
and
as
he
spun
rorke
screamed
out
in
mortal
agony
his
gloved
hands
flew
heavenward
pawing
the
air
he
sank
to
the
canvas
floor
doubled
up
like
a
his
hands
clutching
spasmodically
at
his
abdomen
some
two
or
three
inches
below
the
belt
feltman
stepped
back
in
astonishment
he
had
not
struck
below
the
belt
he
could
not
account
for
rorke
s
posture
of
anguish
but
for
the
fallen
man
s
face
both
feltman
and
the
perplexed
referee
would
have
branded
the
squirming
and
groaning
antics
as
a
pure
fake
but
there
was
nothing
fakelike
in
the
face
that
twitched
above
the
writhing
body
rorke
s
swarthy
visage
had
gone
green
white
it
had
the
ghastly
hue
of
death
on
the
instant
red
keegan
was
leaning
over
the
ropes
shaking
his
fist
in
feltman
s
face
and
squalling
shrilly
did
y
see
that
mister
referee
y
saw
it
y
couldn
t
miss
seeing
it
foul
look
at
the
poor
lad
will
you
he
s
the
referee
honest
roy
constantin
lived
up
to
the
record
that
had
given
him
his
nickname
rorke
was
rolling
about
the
floor
in
torment
his
face
was
better
indorsement
of
his
condition
than
would
have
been
fifty
doctors
certificates
only
by
a
foul
could
such
agony
have
been
caused
not
alone
was
rorke
s
manager
claiming
it
but
fifty
voices
from
boxes
and
bleachers
were
taking
up
the
yell
in
the
wontedly
sheeplike
fashion
of
fight
fans
honest
roy
himself
had
been
behind
rorke
at
the
moment
the
blow
was
struck
but
he
had
seen
that
feltman
was
leading
for
the
body
and
he
could
deduce
the
rest
while
kid
feltman
frothed
at
the
mouth
with
impotent
fury
honest
roy
constantin
thereupon
awarded
the
fight
to
rorke
on
a
flagrant
foul
and
the
whole
thing
was
done
on
the
strength
of
rorke
s
facial
aspect
if
constantin
had
chanced
to
be
an
actor
instead
of
a
poolroom
czar
he
would
never
have
been
taken
in
by
so
simple
a
trick
for
even
in
those
days
it
was
a
common
ruse
on
the
stage
dan
rorke
at
the
outset
of
the
round
had
drawn
in
a
deep
breath
and
he
had
held
it
this
together
with
his
wild
exertions
had
turned
his
complexion
to
a
purple
red
then
suddenly
as
he
fell
he
had
relaxed
his
muscles
and
his
breath
and
had
at
once
taken
another
breath
and
had
rolled
his
eyes
upward
the
receding
blood
had
left
his
face
a
chalky
green
long
rehearsed
acting
had
done
the
rest
after
that
first
frenzied
glare
at
the
referee
he
had
let
his
head
droop
and
had
hidden
his
slowly
incarnadining
cheeks
from
further
view
the
one
glimpse
of
his
face
was
enough
for
honest
roy
you
see
danny
apologised
keegan
when
he
had
half
carried
his
principal
to
the
dressing
room
it
was
the
only
way
out
we
either
misjudged
that
feltman
bird
wrong
or
else
we
overplayed
the
big
improvement
you
ve
been
making
these
past
few
months
one
or
the
other
it
don
t
matter
which
the
way
it
lays
you
ain
t
good
enough
not
yet
to
go
up
against
a
like
him
i
seen
that
before
you
d
been
in
the
ring
two
rounds
he
was
you
up
it
was
either
pull
the
good
old
foul
claim
or
stand
for
a
i
didn
t
dast
give
you
the
office
for
any
funny
business
not
with
honest
roy
refereeing
he
s
a
crank
on
square
fighting
roy
constantin
is
he
d
a
spotted
any
of
our
best
ones
so
i
had
to
frame
it
other
way
round
but
it
was
a
close
call
at
that
when
red
keegan
picked
dan
rorke
out
of
the
puddler
crew
at
the
pitvale
steel
works
he
did
so
after
a
long
psychological
study
this
study
dealt
much
with
the
young
middleweight
s
rugged
strength
and
gameness
and
his
natural
skill
as
a
fighter
but
it
concerned
itself
equally
with
rorke
s
innate
gifts
for
more
subtle
things
among
the
rest
a
certain
crude
ability
for
acting
then
he
had
moulded
the
ignorant
boy
according
to
his
own
wily
plans
as
a
man
keegan
was
not
a
marked
success
as
a
crooked
diplomatist
he
had
sparks
of
genius
too
fragile
and
too
timid
to
hit
a
blow
himself
he
was
a
born
ring
general
and
it
was
his
joy
and
his
talent
to
study
out
more
foul
tactics
than
occur
to
the
normal
fighter
s
bovine
brain
in
the
course
of
a
none
of
these
manœuvres
came
under
the
head
of
rough
stuff
or
even
of
coarse
there
was
a
finesse
to
them
all
they
could
be
pulled
rightly
learned
by
the
right
man
under
the
very
nose
of
the
average
referee
not
once
but
six
times
had
dan
rorke
gone
into
the
ring
coached
by
keegan
and
bested
men
who
were
his
superiors
he
had
done
it
by
a
succession
of
crafty
and
murderous
fouls
which
the
referee
failed
to
bring
home
to
him
twice
by
unobtrusive
butting
in
the
course
of
a
clinch
he
had
ripened
his
antagonist
for
an
easy
again
he
had
driven
his
specially
shod
heel
down
on
the
instep
of
spider
boyce
with
such
scientific
force
as
to
make
the
sufferer
drop
his
guard
long
enough
to
let
in
a
haymaker
to
the
jaw
surreptitious
kneeing
was
another
of
his
arts
all
these
tricks
seem
broad
and
obvious
in
the
telling
so
would
a
full
description
of
the
method
whereby
a
conjurer
hauls
a
kicking
rabbit
out
of
an
empty
hat
it
is
all
in
the
way
it
is
done
and
thanks
to
red
keegan
s
tireless
rehearsing
and
to
his
own
peculiar
talents
rorke
did
it
in
a
way
to
defy
casual
detection
when
an
overkeen
referee
happened
to
be
the
third
man
in
the
ring
there
were
other
tactics
to
fall
back
on
in
such
event
and
with
a
too
formidable
opponent
there
were
still
divers
means
for
wooing
victory
the
claim
of
foul
and
the
anguish
for
example
twice
before
in
other
sections
of
the
fight
map
had
rorke
and
keegan
worked
this
bit
of
acting
as
a
result
dan
rorke
was
rising
fairly
fast
in
his
profession
he
was
not
of
championship
timber
he
would
never
develop
into
such
a
contender
nor
does
one
fighter
in
fifty
but
he
was
good
enough
to
do
all
manner
of
things
to
dozens
of
fairly
good
men
in
the
rank
and
file
of
the
middleweight
army
and
the
dollars
were
drifting
in
to
dan
rorke
himself
fresh
from
the
puddling
gang
and
seeing
the
fight
game
only
through
red
keegan
s
gimlet
eyes
there
was
nothing
wrong
or
even
doubtful
in
his
own
methods
he
took
his
orders
from
keegan
and
his
share
of
the
cash
profits
he
did
not
bother
his
thick
head
about
ethics
it
was
a
week
after
the
battle
and
while
kid
feltman
was
still
making
the
sporting
world
ring
with
his
cries
of
trickery
and
his
clamour
for
a
return
match
rorke
and
his
manager
had
gone
back
to
their
home
town
of
pitvale
not
only
for
a
needed
rest
but
to
let
certain
unjust
and
cruel
accusations
blow
over
rorke
some
months
earlier
had
been
installed
in
the
biggest
room
of
the
manager
s
pitvale
bungalow
and
had
settled
thus
in
the
first
semblance
of
a
home
he
had
ever
known
since
his
graduation
from
the
orphan
asylum
twelve
years
agone
behind
the
bungalow
was
the
rickety
barn
which
served
as
his
training
quarters
dan
s
old
fellow
toilers
of
the
pitvale
steel
works
had
bet
loyally
on
their
former
associate
in
his
fight
with
the
redoubtable
feltman
even
though
their
paladin
had
won
on
a
foul
still
he
had
won
and
they
had
cashed
in
on
their
bets
gratitude
welled
high
in
their
souls
and
it
took
a
practical
form
on
the
morning
of
the
eighth
day
after
the
match
a
delegation
of
five
puddlers
invaded
the
keegan
bungalow
at
breakfast
time
escorting
among
them
a
big
young
collie
dog
gold
and
white
in
hue
classic
in
outline
kingly
in
bearing
the
pup
had
belonged
to
the
foreman
of
the
night
shift
who
was
taking
a
job
somewhere
out
west
and
could
not
carry
his
pet
along
so
the
boys
had
bought
him
cheap
and
now
presented
him
in
due
and
ancient
form
to
dan
rorke
as
a
pledge
of
their
hero
worship
in
all
his
years
rorke
never
before
had
had
a
dog
of
his
very
own
such
luxuries
had
not
been
encouraged
at
the
orphan
asylum
nor
at
any
of
the
boarding
houses
where
he
had
since
lived
now
at
sight
of
the
splendid
beast
the
friendship
of
a
normal
man
for
a
good
dog
woke
within
him
in
spite
of
keegan
s
sour
protests
the
pup
was
installed
in
the
bungalow
as
a
permanent
member
of
the
household
in
honour
of
the
champion
who
just
then
was
the
idol
of
rorke
s
profession
the
newcomer
received
the
historic
name
of
an
instant
and
perfect
liking
sprang
up
between
jeff
and
his
middleweight
master
from
the
first
the
two
were
inseparable
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
the
young
collie
accepted
the
fighter
as
his
one
and
eternal
lord
and
lavished
on
him
a
devotion
he
had
never
granted
to
his
former
uninterested
owner
to
rorke
the
dog
was
a
revelation
his
starved
heart
went
out
to
the
collie
s
staunch
friendliness
his
sluggish
imagination
was
stirred
to
unguessed
depths
by
the
dog
s
flashes
of
cleverness
and
of
gay
loyalty
his
vanity
and
something
deeper
was
touched
to
the
quick
by
the
deathless
worship
in
his
pet
s
eyes
if
dan
rorke
strayed
through
the
town
for
the
sake
of
giving
the
pitvalians
the
privilege
of
gazing
on
their
foremost
citizen
jeff
was
always
trotting
gravely
at
his
side
if
he
suppled
his
hard
muscles
by
a
hike
through
woodland
and
over
mountain
the
collie
s
plumed
tail
was
ever
just
ahead
as
pacemaker
for
the
trip
at
meals
jeff
stretched
himself
out
on
the
floor
beside
rorke
s
chair
scorning
to
beg
but
eagerly
receptive
of
such
food
bits
as
were
tossed
to
him
at
night
the
dog
slept
outside
rorke
s
door
a
keenly
alert
sentinel
over
his
master
s
rest
once
down
on
main
street
a
rorke
fan
swatted
the
fighter
applaudingly
on
the
back
in
practically
the
same
instant
the
swatter
was
on
his
own
back
in
the
street
with
jeff
s
teeth
menacing
him
the
collie
had
misunderstood
the
motive
of
the
blow
and
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
had
sprung
to
his
demigod
s
defence
this
sealed
once
and
forever
rorke
s
love
for
jeff
the
dog
had
risked
dire
punishment
to
ward
off
a
fancied
danger
from
him
it
was
wonderful
tremendous
dan
told
of
it
for
the
next
six
weeks
whenever
he
could
find
anyone
to
listen
to
his
marvellous
yarn
and
he
added
so
many
unconscious
details
in
the
repeated
telling
that
late
comers
in
the
succession
of
listeners
were
left
with
a
vague
impression
that
jeff
had
beaten
off
fully
a
dozen
armed
men
who
had
assailed
the
fighter
keegan
used
to
groan
in
spirit
whenever
dan
pointed
out
jeff
to
some
chance
caller
and
began
the
saga
one
dog
man
earned
rorke
s
lifelong
hatred
and
the
appellation
of
liar
by
his
tactlessness
in
saying
why
most
any
good
purp
will
do
as
much
as
that
if
he
thinks
someone
s
trying
to
hurt
the
feller
that
owns
dan
rorke
was
calmly
certain
that
no
other
dog
on
earth
would
have
had
the
pluck
and
the
loyalty
to
do
it
and
gradually
jeff
became
to
him
a
sort
of
fetish
for
everything
that
was
noblest
which
perhaps
was
quite
as
natural
as
that
a
collie
should
deem
dan
rorke
worthy
of
adoration
on
a
slippery
and
slushy
morning
in
early
spring
some
six
months
after
dog
and
man
formed
their
lifepartnership
dan
started
through
a
corner
of
pitvale
for
his
daily
hike
he
had
just
won
a
battle
and
had
not
yet
signed
up
for
another
in
the
interval
before
hard
training
should
set
in
he
was
keeping
in
shape
by
means
of
these
daily
tramps
and
by
a
little
gym
work
he
and
jeff
came
abreast
of
vining
s
livery
stable
and
were
about
to
swing
past
it
when
out
through
the
open
doorway
flashed
something
tawny
and
big
and
ponderous
in
other
words
vining
s
old
mongrel
english
mastiff
had
caught
scent
of
the
approaching
collie
and
had
dashed
forth
to
do
battle
with
the
stranger
that
was
a
cute
trick
of
vining
s
dog
he
was
a
terror
in
the
neighbourhood
this
huge
mastiff
with
the
quarter
streak
of
bernard
and
the
temper
of
a
sick
wildcat
and
for
years
he
had
maintained
his
repute
as
local
bully
even
now
when
age
and
weight
were
beginning
to
slow
him
down
he
still
revelled
in
the
prospect
of
springing
out
upon
some
unwary
and
less
warlike
dog
as
it
passed
the
stable
and
doing
his
industrious
best
to
kill
it
as
it
chanced
this
was
a
street
seldom
used
by
rorke
and
jeff
and
the
mastiff
had
never
before
met
jeff
mincing
along
on
fastidious
white
toes
through
the
slush
close
behind
his
master
had
no
warning
of
the
attack
the
first
hint
of
danger
came
when
out
of
the
corner
of
his
slanting
dark
eye
he
chanced
to
see
the
whizzing
brindled
bulk
bearing
down
upon
him
there
was
no
time
to
get
out
of
the
way
even
had
jeff
been
of
the
breed
that
gets
out
of
the
way
when
peril
shows
its
shining
face
to
the
average
dog
there
would
have
been
no
chance
to
prepare
for
the
impact
but
the
best
type
of
collie
is
not
an
average
dog
in
his
brain
though
never
in
his
heart
he
harks
back
to
his
wolf
ancestors
it
was
this
ancient
wolf
strain
now
that
made
the
sedately
pacing
jeff
spin
sidewise
as
though
on
a
pivot
letting
the
mastiff
fly
past
him
the
flaring
jaws
missing
his
head
by
an
inch
the
mastiff
whirled
almost
in
and
came
back
to
the
assault
but
as
he
charged
a
second
time
jeff
was
not
there
the
collie
had
not
run
he
had
merely
and
in
the
same
motion
his
white
eyetooth
scored
a
deep
furrow
in
the
side
of
the
charging
foe
dan
rorke
had
swung
aloft
his
walking
stick
to
stop
the
unequal
fight
and
rescue
his
chum
for
he
had
heard
of
the
brindled
monster
s
prowess
but
at
this
move
from
jeff
he
let
his
striking
arm
drop
idle
and
he
sputtered
aloud
in
stark
admiration
footwork
b
gee
and
countering
too
lord
but
jim
corbett
might
a
been
proud
of
that
stunt
again
the
mastiff
was
charging
in
lurching
craftily
to
drive
his
nimbler
foe
into
the
angle
of
door
and
wall
and
thus
to
corner
him
and
render
his
footwork
useless
jeff
saw
through
the
ruse
but
he
saw
too
late
to
escape
now
the
collie
was
a
scant
eighteen
months
old
his
chest
and
shoulders
had
not
yet
gained
the
proportions
that
would
be
theirs
in
another
two
years
moreover
this
was
his
first
battle
left
to
himself
he
would
never
have
sought
trouble
for
he
was
a
friendly
and
frolicsome
youngster
who
had
met
with
nothing
but
kindliness
in
all
his
brief
life
but
his
every
muscle
and
joint
was
as
lithe
as
oiled
whipcord
there
was
not
a
fleck
of
loose
flesh
on
his
wiry
body
and
behind
his
conscious
brain
burned
not
only
the
battle
prowess
but
the
uncanny
shrewdness
of
his
ancient
vulpine
forbears
back
in
the
wilderness
days
the
wolf
that
could
not
hold
his
own
in
warfare
and
be
ready
for
all
surprises
was
the
wolf
that
died
exceeding
young
and
left
no
progeny
the
wolf
that
won
the
right
to
have
descendants
was
the
wolf
brave
enough
and
enough
to
transmit
his
traits
to
those
descendants
all
this
a
thousand
years
ago
and
dan
rorke
s
pet
collie
was
profiting
by
it
when
the
mastiff
charged
him
jeff
acted
on
pure
instinct
having
shown
his
resentment
at
the
effort
to
chew
him
up
he
was
now
quite
content
to
let
the
quarrel
rest
where
it
was
but
apparently
this
dog
mountain
who
had
attacked
him
would
not
have
it
so
in
fact
the
mastiff
had
cornered
him
and
the
only
road
to
safety
was
to
go
through
a
foe
nearly
twice
as
big
as
himself
this
looked
like
an
impossible
task
yet
jeff
tackled
it
his
hind
quarters
were
wedged
between
the
open
door
and
the
street
wall
in
front
was
the
mastiff
the
big
dog
was
not
charging
now
no
need
to
waste
speed
and
rashness
on
a
helplessly
cornered
victim
head
down
legs
crouched
the
mastiff
crept
on
his
waiting
prey
there
was
a
hideous
menace
in
the
crawlingly
savage
advance
up
went
dan
rorke
s
stick
again
dan
had
gripped
the
weapon
by
the
ferrule
and
he
was
measuring
the
distance
between
its
clubbed
handle
and
the
giant
mongrel
s
head
but
as
before
he
did
not
strike
for
there
was
no
need
the
mastiff
gathered
himself
for
a
death
spring
but
jeff
sprang
without
waiting
to
gather
himself
jeff
did
not
spring
aloft
as
did
the
other
he
dived
under
the
rearing
forelegs
slashing
one
of
them
to
the
bone
as
he
sped
the
mastiff
snapped
murderously
at
his
whizzing
foe
as
jeff
passed
under
him
his
ravening
teeth
closed
on
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
golden
ruff
hair
instead
of
reaching
their
goal
in
the
collie
s
vertebræ
and
the
mouthful
of
fur
was
his
sole
asset
from
the
encounter
roaring
aloud
with
rage
and
with
the
pain
of
his
flesh
wounds
the
mongrel
bounded
out
of
the
corner
and
made
for
his
escaped
victim
now
jeff
had
fought
his
way
out
of
the
trap
at
no
worse
loss
than
a
bunch
of
neck
hair
the
whole
world
lay
before
him
as
an
avenue
of
retreat
no
domestic
animal
but
the
greyhound
can
pass
a
strong
young
collie
in
a
footrace
and
assuredly
this
unwieldy
mastiff
could
never
have
hoped
to
overhaul
him
but
a
queer
change
had
come
to
the
friendly
youngster
during
that
ugly
moment
in
the
corner
he
who
had
always
been
on
jolly
terms
with
everyone
had
been
set
upon
in
unprovoked
fashion
while
he
was
minding
his
own
business
he
had
been
threatened
with
death
for
a
less
clever
dog
than
jeff
could
not
have
failed
to
read
red
murder
in
the
mastiff
s
bloodshot
eyes
more
a
wad
of
his
fur
had
been
yanked
out
in
most
painful
fashion
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
eighteen
pleasant
months
of
life
hot
wrath
surged
up
in
the
collie
s
friendly
heart
this
giant
was
not
going
to
treat
him
so
and
get
away
with
it
the
battle
yell
of
his
wolf
ancestors
burst
from
jeff
s
furry
throat
as
the
mastiff
turned
he
faced
a
wholly
different
antagonist
from
the
astonished
puppy
he
had
set
upon
in
the
corner
ruff
abristle
head
down
snowy
fangs
glinting
from
under
his
upwrithing
lip
young
jeff
flew
to
meet
him
like
a
fluffy
catapult
and
a
truly
epochal
fight
was
on
the
mastiff
went
at
his
work
with
veteran
ferocity
and
method
born
of
fifty
death
fights
but
he
had
run
up
against
something
unique
in
his
long
experience
jeff
was
not
there
or
rather
jeff
was
everywhere
at
once
and
nowhere
in
particular
he
was
in
and
out
and
over
and
under
never
wasting
time
in
seeking
for
a
permanent
hold
but
nipping
tearing
or
slashing
and
then
striking
at
almost
the
same
instant
for
some
totally
different
part
of
the
mongrel
s
big
body
the
mastiff
reared
and
thrashed
about
ever
striving
to
pin
his
adversary
under
him
to
crush
him
down
by
dint
of
vast
weight
to
pinion
him
while
the
heavy
jaws
should
find
their
but
jeff
had
an
annoying
fashion
of
not
staying
in
any
one
place
long
enough
to
be
annihilated
and
at
every
impact
his
white
teeth
were
leaving
their
red
mark
it
s
it
s
corbett
and
sullivan
all
over
again
blithered
dan
rorke
his
expert
eye
following
each
move
his
soul
afire
with
prideful
ecstasy
at
his
untried
chum
s
marvellous
war
genius
will
you
look
at
that
footwork
he
exhorted
high
heaven
and
the
knot
of
spectators
then
his
triumph
song
became
a
grunt
the
mastiff
in
one
of
his
mad
lunges
had
found
his
mark
his
jaws
closed
on
jeff
s
furpadded
shoulder
and
he
hung
on
with
one
wrench
of
his
bull
head
he
bore
the
slighter
dog
to
earth
and
began
to
grind
his
jaws
into
the
shoulder
he
had
seized
for
a
moment
jeff
writhed
and
flung
himself
about
impotently
in
the
fearsome
grip
in
that
instant
of
futile
heaving
his
eyes
sought
and
met
rorke
s
and
in
the
flashing
gaze
there
was
no
tinge
of
fear
or
of
appeal
it
was
as
though
he
tried
to
assure
the
man
that
he
had
fought
his
best
and
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
do
no
better
but
before
dan
s
stick
could
go
up
there
was
a
new
flurry
of
fur
and
flesh
and
jeff
s
sharp
teeth
had
sunk
in
agonising
style
deep
into
one
of
the
mongrel
s
thick
pads
the
pain
was
so
sudden
and
acute
that
the
mastiff
loosed
his
merciless
shoulder
grip
to
lunge
for
the
collie
s
head
and
in
that
brief
instant
jeff
was
not
only
on
his
feet
and
free
but
was
back
at
the
assault
with
all
his
primal
zest
the
mastiff
bleeding
and
almost
breathless
reared
for
another
attack
his
cut
hind
foot
clawed
at
a
film
of
ice
on
the
slippery
pavement
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
floundering
on
his
back
in
the
slush
for
a
second
he
lay
there
stunned
for
his
head
had
hit
the
edge
of
the
open
door
as
he
fell
and
his
brindled
throat
was
exposed
and
defenceless
now
s
your
chance
jeff
chortled
rorke
deliriously
him
but
the
collie
did
not
take
the
chance
as
the
mongrel
tumbled
backward
jeff
had
darted
in
at
him
but
when
he
saw
the
huge
brute
prone
and
helpless
on
the
ground
the
collie
for
some
innate
sportsmanly
reason
forbore
to
fly
at
the
inviting
throat
and
rip
out
the
jugular
instead
looking
down
in
grave
wonder
at
the
sprawling
and
kicking
mastiff
jeff
took
a
step
backward
and
stood
ears
cocked
head
on
one
side
slender
body
still
braced
for
action
waiting
for
the
fallen
dog
to
rise
dan
gasped
then
he
swore
aloud
the
mongrel
staggered
to
his
feet
all
the
fight
knocked
out
of
him
by
the
stunning
head
blow
and
by
loss
of
blood
jeff
danced
forward
afresh
to
the
fray
but
tail
between
legs
the
mastiff
turned
and
limped
off
into
the
stable
his
back
and
the
slipping
hind
legs
offered
rare
chance
for
the
victor
to
clinch
his
conquest
but
jeff
only
stared
in
mild
interest
after
his
beaten
enemy
then
limping
a
bit
from
his
shoulder
wound
and
panting
fast
from
his
fierce
exertions
he
trotted
over
to
dan
rorke
and
thrust
his
wet
muzzle
into
his
master
s
hand
as
if
in
quest
of
sympathy
or
praise
he
got
both
fairly
crowing
with
exultation
dan
dropped
his
stick
and
flung
both
arms
about
his
scarred
pet
in
a
bear
hug
gee
but
you
re
the
real
thing
jeffie
he
carolled
fondling
the
inordinately
happy
dog
of
all
the
pups
that
ever
happened
you
re
you
re
that
pup
say
appealing
to
the
crowd
did
you
birds
ever
see
the
like
of
this
feller

footwork
did
you
and
did
you
see
how
he
wouldn

pitch
into
that
big
stiff
when
he
was
down
and
out
some
white
man

red
keegan
pattered
home
excitedly
from
a
morning
visit
to
the
pitvale
hotel
in
his
hand
he
was
brandishing
a
telegram
that
had
been
received
at
the
hotel
telegraph
desk
while
he
was
there
he
made
his
way
on
hurrying
feet
to
the
barn
back
of
the
bungalow
which
served
his
fighters
as
a
gym
and
where
at
this
time
of
day
rorke
was
reasonably
certain
to
be
dawdling
with
the
punching
bag
he
came
upon
dan
kneeling
beside
his
collie
and
washing
out
lovingly
a
deeply
ragged
cut
in
the
dog
s
right
shoulder
at
sight
of
the
manager
rorke
broke
forth
into
a
gleeful
recital
of
the
bout
between
jeff
and
the
mastiff
but
he
had
scarcely
gotten
through
the
first
sentence
when
keegan
cut
him
short
that
c
n

the
manager

rorke
unimpressed
but

lit
into
him
after
he

fought
his
way
out

corner

with
the
exquisite
courtesy
of
his

biggest
thing
we

ever
pulled
off
and
you
go
gassing
bout
a
measly
dog
fight
i
tell
you
well
retorted
dan
nettled
at
his
manager
s
tone
and
still
more
at
his
total
dearth
of
appreciation
for
jeff
i
don
t
see
as
there
s
anything
to
put
on
a
silk
shirt
for
in
the
bunch
of

you
ve
lugged
home
with
you
when
i
fought

back
in

heels
forward
if
we
hadn

i

some
since
then
i
know
that
but
i
don

figger
i
ve
gone
ahead
far
enough
to
stop
kid

and
we
can
t
try
the
same
stunt
a
second
time
on
him
he

be
watching
for
it

will
the

s

a
lad
like

interposed
keegan
with
weary
scorn
you
talk
even
foolisher
n
you
look
and
you
look
foolisher
n
any
other
man
the
lord
ever
bothered
to
pin
a
face
onto
i
told
you
a
month
ago
the
way
i
was
aiming
to
work
this
thing
if
you
ve
got
more
int
rest
in
how
you
re
bandaging
that
cur
s
shoulder
than
in
the
way
we
re
due
to
make
a
killing
there
s
no
use
going
over
it
all
again
to
you
i
remember
last
time
you
were
so
busy
teaching
jeff
to
speak
for
bones
that
you
didn
t
more
n
half
listen
to
me
and
now
i
s
pose
i
got
to
say
it
all
over
he
sighed
it
was
the
sigh
of
a
martyr
but
dan
did
not
answer
with
worried
tenderness
he
was
twining
about
jeff
s
hurt
shoulder
a
festoon
of
bandage
with
patience
an
ostentatious
and
patience
keegan
waited
until
the
task
was
ended
and
the
bandaged
collie
was
curled
up
at
his
master
s
feet
then
he
spoke
feltman
s
been
after
that
return
fight
with
us
he
began
with
laboured
detail
and
as
if
talking
to
a
mental
defective
till
he
s
got
so
he
d
pretty
near
be
willing
to
get
into
the
ring
with
you
blindfold
and
with
both
hands
tied
behind
him
maybe
you
know
that
if
you
know
anything
which
you
don
t
he
s
itching
to
square
himself
for
that
of
ours
and
i
ve
been
letting
him
itch
till
he
wouldn
t
gag
on
terms
but
at
that
it
s
a
miracle
we
ve
landed
him
anyone
with
a
grain
of
sense
ought
to
see
through
it
first
i
juggle
the
carn
val
crowd
into
making
him
and
his
manager
stand
for
sol
kampfmuller
as
ref
ree
if
there
s
anything
sol
knows
less
about
than
ref
reeing
a
fight
i
d
like
to
know
what
it
is
being
sporting
ed
tor
of
the
here
he
thinks
he
knows
it
all
and
that
what
he
don
t
know
he
suspects
i
ve
seen
him
ref
ree
two
fights
why
that
poor
ocity
wouldn
t
know
a
foul
if
it
was
printed
out
for
him
on
a
raised
map
anyone
could
get
by
with
murder
with
him
as
ref
ree
it
s
most
a
shame
to
try
the
real
classy
stunts
on
him
any
raw
work
d
do
feltman
s
nearer
a
than
ever
you
ll
get
to
be
in
fifty
years
but
he
s
a
numbwit
you
could
hit
him
with
an
axe
in
the
ring
before
he
d
find
out
he
was
being
fouled
so
there
s
your
comb
nation
a
chucklehead
ref
ree
and
a
guy
who
don
t
know
how
to
watch
out
for
fouls
and
then
there
s
you
who
i
ve
learned
to
be
the
best
lad
at
slick
fouling
in
the
whole
business
why
it
s
too
easy
it
s
a
crime
you
c
n
cripple
or
dizzy
him
in
the
very
first
round
if
you
ve
a
mind
to
and
as
often
after
that
as
you
need
then
keep
remembering
that
purse
with
eighty
per
cent
for
the
winner
and
even
a
like
yours
ought
to
be
able
to
figger
out
the
answer
we
ll
start
you
training
i
ve
a
couple
of
corking
new
ones
i
ve
worked
out
lately
one
of
em
s
a
killer
and
both
of
em
smooth
enough
to
get
past
most
any
ref
ree
let
alone
sol
kampfmuller
and
that
carn
val
crowd
we
ll
work
em
out
and
brush
up
on
a
few
of
the
old
ones
too
so
funny
thing
spoke
up
rorke
his
hand
on
the
dog
s
head
funny
think
bout
jeffie
here
he
had
a
dandy
chance
to
rip
the
throat
out
of
that
vining
dog
and
he
wouldn
t
do
it
just
because
the
dog
was
down
and
couldn
t
help
himself
what
d
you
think
of
that
red
just
because
the
other
dog
was
down
no
ref
ree
to
penalise
him
for
fouling
either
he
just
stepped
back
kind
of
polite
like
and
for
the
love
of
mike
groaned
the
irate
manager
will
you
stop
jawing
about
that
bum
cur
and
then
pursued
rorke
serenely
when
vining
s
dog
turned
tail
and
sneaked
away
jeff
had
the
chance
of
his
life
to
tear
in
and
do
all
sorts
of
damage
but
he
didn
t
wouldn
t
fight
foul
the
grand
little
cuss
rorke
fell
silent
the
manager
stared
at
him
in
lofty
and
wordless
contempt
but
dan
did
not
see
him
still
patting
jeff
s
head
aimlessly
and
brooding
over
the
couchant
dog
with
puckered
eyes
he
sat
there
dan
rorke
was
thinking
and
thought
to
him
was
as
difficult
as
it
was
rare
presently
he
spoke
again
in
a
rumbling
ruminating
mutter
wouldn
t
fight
foul
jeff
wouldn
t
he
repeated
fought
like
a
bearcat
so
long
as
the
scrap
was
even
but
not
a
foul
stunt
from
first
to
last
wouldn
t
win
on
a
foul
he
couldn
t
tell
but
what
that
big
mutt
would
get
up
and
tear
him
in
half
like
he
d
just
come
plenty
close
to
doing
but
jeff
wouldn
t
tackle
him
while
he
was
down
wouldn
t
say
put
in
keegan
i
m
going
to
the
house
to
write
a
letter
and
then
send
off
a
wire
keep
right
on
talking
please
all
the
while
i
m
gone
keep
on
telling
about
that
dog
fight
then
by
the
time
i
get
back
maybe
the
most
of
it
will
have
got
out
n
your
system
and
you
can
think
of
real
things
again
so
dan
rorke
did
not
obey
his
manager
s
elephantinely
sarcastic
request
to
go
on
talking
of
the
dog
fight
in
keegan
s
absence
but
he
did
the
next
thing
he
went
on
thinking
about
it
at
least
his
wontedly
sluggish
thoughts
fixed
themselves
on
one
detail
of
the
fray
clinging
to
it
like
leeches
and
sending
forth
ramifications
into
the
far
and
unused
recesses
of
his
brain
these
thoughts
were
not
put
into
words
but
their
gist
may
be
translated
roughly
into
english
somewhat
as
follows
jeff
had
fought
without
training
or
precept
he
had
followed
his
own
instincts
he
had
fought
according
to
his
nature
thus
he
had
fought
fair
he
had
fought
clean
not
only
had
he
disdained
to
make
use
of
any
crooked
advantage
but
he
had
risked
defeat
and
possible
death
sooner
than
to
foul
jeff
was
a
dog
dan
rorke
was
a
man
how
did
dan
rorke
win
his
fights
three
out
of
four
of
them
he
won
by
clever
fouling
he
fought
crooked
that
was
how
he
made
his
living
by
tactics
his
own
dog
would
not
stoop
to
the
collie
looked
on
dan
as
the
greatest
person
under
the
sun
yet
the
dog
fought
square
and
dan
fought
foul
what
was
the
answer
it
was
a
joke
in
fistic
circles
that
dan
rorke
was
the
dirtiest
fighter
in
that
section
of
america
and
that
he
managed
to
get
away
with
it
by
sheer
craftiness
dan
had
felt
still
felt
a
thrill
of
admiration
for
jeff
for
fighting
so
fair
wasn
t
it
possible
that
the
fight
public
might
give
that
same
sort
of
admiration
to
a
man
who
was
known
to
fight
fair
going
a
tottering
mental
step
farther
wasn
t
it
just
barely
possible
that
all
reg
lar
folks
had
that
same
little
thrill
of
admiration
for
a
fellow
who
was
on
the
level
in
everything
it
was
a
funny
idea
of
course
but
then
again
it
was
great
to
have
someone
even
a
dog
look
up
to
anybody
as
jeff
looked
up
to
his
master
and
to
think
that
master
was
the
best
man
alive
what
sort
of
mangy
hypocrite
was
dan
rorke
to
make
his
living
crookedly
by
while
jeff
thought
he
was
a
saint
the
dog
fought
clean
the
man
fought
dirty
was
the
man
lower
than
the
dog
it
was
a
rotten
thought
but
it
had
a
whole
lot
of
sense
to
it
if
jeff
here
could
risk
death
sooner
than
fight
foul
what
was
the
reason
why
dan
rorke
at
this
point
in
the
argument
dan
stopped
and
started
all
over
from
the
beginning
he
was
on
the
third
complete
review
of
it
when
red
keegan
came
bustling
back
well
queried
the
manager
briskly
have
you
told
yourself
enough
about
the
dog
fight
so
s
you
c
n
remember
it
a
while
without
telling
it
again
i
i
guess
so
mumbled
dan
uncertainly
and
he
made
excuse
to
get
out
of
the
way
he
was
still
thinking
thinking
hard
and
with
a
growing
unhappiness
his
thoughts
were
not
yet
crystallisable
into
words
but
next
morning
after
a
night
of
less
continuous
slumber
than
he
could
recall
in
many
a
year
he
dressed
and
started
down
to
breakfast
with
a
and
resolve
in
his
tired
mind
for
once
in
his
life
he
had
solved
a
problem
had
solved
it
all
himself
as
he
opened
the
door
of
his
bedroom
jeff
leaped
eagerly
up
from
his
nightly
vigil
post
across
the
outer
threshold
stiff
as
he
was
from
his
shoulder
hurt
the
dog
gambolled
gleefully
round
his
master
patting
at
dan
s
knees
with
his
flying
white
paws
wriggling
himself
into
an
ecstatic
interrogation
mark
and
whimpering
with
delight
at
the
wonderful
fact
that
his
adored
demigod
was
once
more
with
him
after
ten
whole
hours
of
absence
thus
the
world
over
do
the
average
run
of
collies
give
morning
salute
to
the
man
or
woman
they
have
accepted
as
their
deity
and
as
ever
the
greeting
warmed
dan
rorke
s
heart
he
stooped
over
and
patted
the
silken
head
the
collie
growled
in
horrific
menace
and
caught
dan
s
big
hand
between
his
mighty
jaws
as
if
to
crush
it
but
the
jaws
did
not
exert
the
pressure
of
a
fraction
of
an
ounce
on
the
firm
flesh
they
had
so
playfully
imprisoned
and
the
throaty
growls
were
belied
by
a
furious
wagging
of
the
plumed
tail
this
was
jeff
s
favourite
game
with
his
master
with
no
one
else
would
he
deign
to
play
dan
rumpled
the
dog
s
soft
ears
and
looked
with
a
queer
new
timidity
into
the
dark
eyes
of
his
chum
at
the
unquestioning
joyous
devotion
he
saw
there
he
felt
a
tiny
twinge
of
relief
something
he
had
let
himself
fear
in
the
long
night
s
meditations
had
not
yet
begun
to
happen
there
was
still
time
plenty
of
time
and
his
resolve
firmer
than
ever
he
ran
down
to
the
breakfast
room
where
red
keegan
was
already
seating
himself
at
the
table
cle
got
a
spread
on
your
match
with
feltman
was
the
manager
s
morning
salutation
first
page
and
again
under
kampfmuller
s
sign
ture
on
the
sporting
page
we
ve
got
a
good
start
all
right
now
if
it
isn
t
too
late
said
dan
hesitantly
i
kind
of
wish
you
d
cancel
the
match
i
don
t
honest
think
i
c
n
stop
kid
feltman
for
all
you
say
i
ve
gone
ahead
this
half
year
and
it
s
more
n
an
even
bet
he
c
n
stop
me
inside
the
limit
so
i
ve
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
guess
you
d
best
call
it
off
or
get
em
to
subst
toot
some
easier
guy
than
felt
good
lord
snorted
keegan
do
you
set
there
and
tell
me
you
don
t
even
remember
from
yesterday
the
layout
for
that
fight
of
all
the
yep
answered
rorke
sullenly
playing
with
his
food
and
glancing
down
for
encouragement
at
the
collie
lying
on
the
floor
beside
him
yep
i
remember
it
all
right
all
right
red
i
remember
it
but
it
won
t
work
that
s
why
i
won
t
thundered
keegan
glaring
across
at
his
embarrassed
star
why
the
blue
hell
won
t
it
work
it
s
the
prettiest
we
ve
ever
handled
there
ain
t
a
flaw
to
it
won
t
work
hey
why
the
because
replied
dan
sheepishly
yet
firm
as
stone
as
he
glowered
back
at
his
manager
because
that
of
yours
calls
for
a
heap
of
fancy
fouling
and
and
i
m
i
m
off
fouling
off
it
for
keeps
that
s
red
keegan
broke
in
on
the
halting
announcement
with
a
sound
that
a
turkey
might
have
produced
had
its
tail
feathers
been
pulled
violently
at
the
moment
it
chanced
to
be
gobbling
the
result
was
a
noise
that
brought
jeff
to
his
feet
with
a
jump
his
tulip
ears
cocked
his
eyes
aglow
with
excited
inquiry
a
series
of
staccato
barks
racketing
from
his
furry
throat
lay
down
jeffie
ordered
dan
he
ain
t
going
to
bite
me
he
s
only
are
you
plumb
crazy
dan
sputtered
the
manager
or
is
it
a
bum
little
joke
off
fouling
hey
what
s
going
to
keep
you
from
the
hungry
house
if
if
clean
scrapping
won
t
keep
me
fed
answered
rorke
i
ll
go
get
back
my
job
in
the
puddling
gang
anyhow
it
goes
like
i
said
i
m
off
fouling
now
go
ahead
and
swear
but
red
keegan
did
not
go
ahead
and
swear
profanity
was
a
very
present
help
to
the
nerves
in
the
event
of
stepping
on
a
tack
or
mashing
one
s
thumb
with
a
hammer
or
on
hearing
that
one
s
wife
had
eloped
but
this
matter
lay
too
deep
for
swearing
blusteringly
then
flatteringly
then
coaxingly
and
at
last
with
the
tremolo
stop
pulled
far
out
he
pleaded
with
dan
he
painted
in
glowing
colours
the
middleweight
s
comfortable
rise
from
the
ranks
and
the
golden
future
that
awaited
him
under
keegan
s
guidance
if
only
he
would
have
the
intelligence
to
stick
to
his
manager
s
tuition
and
not
get
fool
ideas
that
he
could
fight
on
the
square
well
enough
to
keep
himself
warm
he
foretold
a
future
of
failure
and
gutter
poverty
should
the
fool
hold
to
this
suicidal
new
plan
to
all
of
which
dan
rorke
answered
not
a
word
but
sat
glumly
frowning
at
the
spotty
tablecloth
and
occasionally
letting
his
fidgety
hand
rest
for
a
second
on
jeff
s
head
when
at
last
keegan
had
run
down
and
was
bereft
equally
of
breath
and
vocabulary
and
emotion
dan
began
to
speak
he
did
not
look
at
the
puffingly
apoplectic
manager
but
rambled
on
as
if
addressing
the
hole
in
his
napkin
a
feller
told
me
once
he
began
that
there
s
mighty
little
a
collie
dog
don
t
know
and
i
ve
seen
enough
of
jeff
here
to
find
out
that
s
so
jeff
c
n
tell
when
i
m
blue
and
when
i
m
tickled
just
by
looking
at
me
it
it
d
be
funny
wouldn
t
it
if
he
c
d
get
to
telling
by
looking
at
me
that
i
m
not
on
the
square
a
dog
with
jeff
s
breeding
and
jeff
s
sense
would
sure
be
too
to
pal
with
a
crook
if
he
knowed
it
and
he
knows
a
lot
of
things
i
d
never
s
posed
a
animal
c
d
he
looked
down
again
at
the
collie
as
if
for
moral
support
at
the
worry
in
his
master
s
glance
jeff
s
dark
eyes
took
on
a
glint
of
eager
concern
he
laid
one
white
little
forepaw
on
dan
s
muddy
boot
and
whined
softly
far
down
in
his
throat
thus
encouraged
rorke
went
on
that
s
only
one
end
of
it
here
s
another
a
man
s
pretty
low
down
in
the
list
ain
t
he
if
he
can
t
even
fight
as
square
as
his
dog
c
n
fight
a
clean
dog
s
sure
got
a
right
to
a
clean
master
them
folks
yesterday
was
all
praising
jeff
they
wasn
t
praising
him
so
much
for
licking
the
big
feller
as
for
licking
him
and
for
not
fouling
when
he
had
a
chance
to
i
c
d
see
that
myself
well
i
sh
d
think
folks
would
feel
that
way
about
a
man
that
fights
clean
anyhow
he
finished
defiantly
no
poor
dog
s
going
to
have
the
right
to
say
he
s
a
whiter
man
than
what
i
am
i
been
thinking
it
all
over
and
that
s
the
answer
i
m
off
fouling
like
i
for
the
next
hours
the
bungalow
and
the
gym
were
vibrant
with
the
sounds
of
argument
and
vituperation
keegan
exhausted
his
every
battery
and
like
most
men
who
think
slowly
and
seldom
dan
rorke
grew
more
and
more
firmly
set
in
his
queer
resolution
the
more
he
discussed
it
even
stolid
bud
curly
his
sparring
partner
and
general
handy
man
round
the
gym
was
moved
to
bewilderment
by
the
fighter
s
firmness
in
resisting
the
boss
only
once
in
a
day
and
night
of
abusive
exhortation
on
red
s
part
did
dan
lose
for
an
instant
his
sullen
calm
that
was
when
keegan
grumbled
it
s
all
the
damn
dog
s
fault
it
s
him
that
s
turned
you
loony
i
ve
got
a
good
mind
to
shoot
him
then
maybe
you
ll
you
shoot
that
dog
flared
rorke
striding
up
to
the
little
manager
his
thick
fingers
working
convulsively
and
by
the
good
lord
i
swear
i
ll
break
your
neck
over
my
knee
if
i
go
to
the
chair
for
it
that
goes
for
too
curly
if
you
think
i
m
bluffing
you
d
best
change
your
mind
unless
you
re
sick
of
staying
alive
it
goes
to
bud
curly
s
surprise
the
irascible
red
did
not
retort
instead
he
stood
looking
long
and
earnestly
at
the
raging
fighter
then
he
said
with
conciliatory
calm
nobody
wants
to
hurt
the
purp
dan
climb
down
off
the
ceiling
and
if
you
re
so
dead
set
on
playing
the
fool
well
i
s
pose
i
ll
have
to
trail
my
bets
along
with
yours
you
can
t
lick
feltman
on
the
square
but
it
won
t
be
my
fault
if
you
don
t
put
up
the
best
fight
of
your
life
ag
in
him
it
s
too
late
to
cancel
the
match
now
all
me
and
curly
c
n
do
is
to
train
you
to
the
minute
and
trust
to
luck
for
the
glad
to
have
won
his
sorry
point
dan
settled
down
with
grim
energy
to
the
task
of
training
he
knew
how
slight
were
his
chances
of
victory
yet
he
was
ready
to
meet
the
suddenly
reconciled
keegan
halfway
by
training
at
his
level
best
feltman
and
a
little
retinue
came
to
pitvale
in
order
to
be
on
the
ground
and
to
avoid
travel
before
the
fight
they
set
up
training
quarters
scarce
two
blocks
away
from
keegan
s
bungalow
for
nearly
a
month
the
two
rivals
wrought
at
their
preparations
for
the
battle
once
or
twice
on
hike
or
sprint
they
chanced
to
meet
in
street
or
highroad
and
such
chance
meetings
with
their
mutual
scowling
frigidity
served
kampfmuller
as
splendid
copy
for
the
the
fight
was
to
be
held
in
the
pitvale
coliseum
a
vast
and
barnlike
structure
originally
built
for
state
conventions
and
for
summer
chautauqua
lectures
it
was
scheduled
for
ten
o
clock
on
the
night
of
april
second
on
the
morning
of
april
second
dan
rorke
awoke
from
a
sleep
ran
under
the
shower
rubbed
down
slipped
into
his
clothes
and
started
for
breakfast
with
the
appetite
of
a
longshoreman
his
nerves
as
well
as
his
physique
had
profited
by
his
hard
and
wise
training
if
he
was
due
to
end
the
day
in
defeat
at
least
the
thought
of
it
had
not
marred
his
night
s
rest
or
his
appetite
outside
his
bedroom
door
he
paused
as
usual
for
his
morning
frolic
with
jeff
but
jeff
was
not
there
in
all
their
long
months
of
chumship
this
was
the
first
morning
that
jeff
had
not
been
on
hand
to
greet
with
noisy
delight
his
master
and
the
dog
s
absence
perplexed
rorke
downstairs
he
went
hoping
to
find
the
collie
waiting
for
him
in
the
the
room
was
empty
whistling
for
the
missing
jeff
dan
went
out
on
the
tiny
front
porch
no
dog
was
in
view
but
he
saw
keegan
and
bud
working
with
scrambly
haste
at
a
far
end
of
the
yard
piling
shovelfuls
of
fresh
dirt
into
what
looked
like
a
hole
under
the
yard
s
one
fruit
tree
before
dan
could
call
out
curly
happened
to
look
up
from
his
toil
and
caught
sight
of
him
as
he
stood
on
the
porch
steps
curly
nudged
keegan
and
said
something
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
the
two
exchanged
nervous
whispers
then
red
dropped
his
spade
and
came
hurrying
towards
the
house
a
labouredly
artificial
smile
of
greeting
on
his
bothered
face
seen
jeff
anywhere
asked
rorke
his
puzzled
eyes
still
on
curly
who
was
now
patting
the
crumbly
earth
smooth
over
the
filled
excavation
sure
i
ve
seen
him
babbled
keegan
with
forced
joviality
and
looking
anywhere
rather
than
at
dan
he
was
frisking
round
here
just
a
minute
ago
must
a
run
down
street
a
ways
he
ll
be
back
soon
come
on
in
and
eat
sleep
all
right
i
wasn
t
expecting
you
down
for
another
ten
he
had
mounted
the
steps
and
almost
forcibly
was
propelling
dan
indoors
looking
for
jeff
hollowly
queried
bud
curly
coming
up
the
steps
behind
him
he
s
all
right
good
old
jeff
s
all
right
he
was
playing
round
in
the
gym
just
dan
rorke
was
the
least
subtle
of
men
and
his
brain
was
too
small
to
hold
suspicion
but
a
child
would
have
been
keenly
aware
of
the
guilt
and
furtiveness
in
the
manner
of
the
two
dan
stopped
short
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
then
at
the
fresh
earth
under
the
fruit
tree
red
you
told
me
jeff
went
down
street
he
accused
and
now
bud
says
he
s
out
in
the
gym
which
of
you
is
lying
and
why
is
either
of
you
lying
and
what
were
you
burying
out
there
speak
up
one
of
you
or
i
ll
go
there
and
dig
till
i
find
out
he
spoke
with
rising
excitement
as
he
finished
he
made
as
if
to
start
across
the
yard
towards
the
tree
both
men
seized
him
and
both
began
speaking
at
once
jeff
s
all
right
insisted
red
and
we
was
just
spading
up
the
earth
to
make
that
tree
grow
better
it
s
too
spindly
and
yes
declared
bud
in
the
same
breath
jeff
s
feeling
fine
he
ll
be
back
pres
n
ly
we
was
trying
to
see
could
we
bury
some
garbage
out
yonder
stead
of
bothering
to
burn
it
we
jeff
is
dead
interrupted
dan
his
voice
all
at
once
lifeless
and
flat
you
been
burying
him
you
don
t
want
me
to
know
he
the
two
others
fidgeted
guiltily
then
clearing
his
throat
keegan
said
i
wanted
to
keep
it
from
you
till
after
danny
i
m
sorry
sorry
right
down
to
the
ground
but
since
you
ve
guessed
that
much
of
it
i
d
best
tell
you
the
whole
thing

up
and
take
it
like
a
son
after
all
he
was
only
just
a
dog
i
ll
buy
you
another
one
and
there
ain
t
any
other
one
denied
rorke
chokingly
there
was
only
just
jeff
him
and
me
and
he
was
the
chum
i
what
happened
to
him
he
demanded
fiercely
swallowing
very
hard
and
trying
to
keep
his
voice
steady
and
his
eyes
dry
spill
it
then
take
it
cried
keegan
harshly
take
it
straight
like
a
had
ought
to
take
rotten
news
this
morning
when
i
went
apast
your
door
there

was
i
picked

up
and
brang
him
down
on
the
porch

knowed
how

and
that
he
would
come
home
by
and
by

keegan
slowly
was
that
old
slob
that
feltman
has
for
a
handy
man
the
feller
that
bought
the
poison
and
asked
reuter
how
to
fix
it
was
kid
feltman
he
the
manager
got
no
further
dan
rorke
was
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
steps
at
one
bound
it
was
only
as
he
stopped
to
yank
madly
at
the
gate
latch
that
red
and
curly
overtook
him
and
threw
themselves
bodily
on
the
raging
man
even
then
it
was
a
matter
of
minutes
before
their
combined
strength
and
bud
s
wrestling
grip
from
behind
could
quell
him
let
me
go
he
snarled
straining
and
biting
at
the
detaining
arms
i
ll
settle
with
him
before
jeff
s
cold
i
ll
you
ll
settle
with
him
a
heap
better
n
by
trying
to
beat
him
up
now
with
his
handlers
and
them
to
keep
you
from
doing
it
promised
keegan
there
s
better
ways
lots
better
ways
you
listen
to
me
danny
boy
momentarily
spent
with
his
own
fury
rorke
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
indoors
there
keegan
faced
him
and
said
you
want
to
square
yourself
with
feltman
and
more
n
square
yourself
good
then
here
s
the
way
feltman
s
always
hated
you
ever
since
he
lost
to
you
that
time
he
s
told
fifty
folks
he
d
get
even
he
s
seen
and
he
s
heard
how
much
store
you
set
by
jeff
so
he
poisoned
him
to
get
back
at
you
now
here
s
how
you
ll
get
back
at
you
was
going
to
fight
him
clean
and
he
d
a
most
likely
won
so
that
ain
t
the
way
to
fight
him
if
you
want
to
settle
with
him
for
poor
jeff
the
way
to
do
is
to
sail
in
with
every
foul
that
can
git
past
kampfmuller
and
a
hay
load
of
em
c
n
git
past
that
ivory
mine
foul
him
from
the
start
with
the
murderingest
set
of
fouls
i
ve
ever
learned
you
cripple
him
so
he
ll
be
in
the
hosp
tal
a
year
foul
him
into
a
dead
one
and
then
punch
his
head
off
n
him
and
win
as
early
in
the
fight
as
you
want
to
git
the
idee
foul
him
to
death
if
you
like
it
s
no
worse
n
he
treated
jeff
the
ring
s
the
place
to
finish
him
not
now
where
you
d
likely
land
up
in
the
hoosgow
before
you
d
more
n
half
hit
him
go
to
it
dan
grunted
avid
assent
and
after
breakfast
careful
rehearsing
of
old
foul
tactics
and
a
study
of
new
ones
began
as
dan
rorke
stripped
and
eager
sat
in
his
hot
dressing
room
under
the
auditorium
that
night
waiting
for
the
summons
to
enter
the
ring
he
had
his
first
minute
of
solitary
reflection
throughout
the
whole
day
his
manager
was
upstairs
wrangling
with
the
carnival
treasurer
curly
had
gone
to
the
ring
to
watch
the
of
the
second
preliminary
bout
dan
was
alone
in
his
heart
still
raged
black
hate
and
a
craving
for
revenge
and
he
was
sick
with
grief
over
his
chum
s
murder
while
he
sat
there
the
faint
challenge
bark
of
a
dog
a
collie
perhaps
from
nowhere
in
particular
drifted
to
him
through
the
walls
at
the
sound
dan
started
violently
he
whispered
under
his
breath
as
if
in
answer
to
his
call
the
room
all
at
once
seemed
athrob
with
the
presence
of
his
loved
dog
in
superstitious
awe
dan
peered
about
him
then
he
straightened
his
bent
body
and
to
an
unseen
something
he
began
to
speak
we
re
going
to
pay
up
the
bill
in
a
few
minutes
now
jeffie
he
promised
watch
me
the
foolish
words
started
a
new
train
of
thoughts
in
the
tormented
brain
watch
him
the
dog
watch
his
master
put
up
the
foulest
fight
of
his
career
with
the
vision
came
sharp
revulsion
watch
me
jeff
he
repeated
aloud
watch
me
do
it
watch
me
do
it
square
jeffie
boy
while
the
odd
exaltation
was
still
upon
him
keegan
and
curly
came
back
to
the
dressing
room
to
escort
him
to
the
arena
the
pitvale
athletic
carnival
crowd
that
night
witnessed
the
bloodiest
and
most
spectacularly
ferocious
battle
in
the
annals
of
the
local
ring
from
the
sound
of
the
gong
dan
rorke
was
at
his
antagonist
forcing
the
fight
at
every
point
never
once
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
did
he
abandon
the
aggressive
feltman
showered
upon
him
an
avalanche
of
scientific
punishment
but
it
failed
to
slow
down
that
homicidal
attack
to
red
keegan
s
dismay
and
despite
his
dumfounded
pleas
rorke
fought
as
clean
as
a
galahad
not
once
would
he
make
use
of
even
the
safest
foul
not
once
would
he
seek
to
elude
the
dull
referee
by
using
the
easiest
of
keegan
s
carefully
taught
ruses
he
fought
like
a
wild
beast
but
he
fought
like
a
fair
one
buoyed
up
by
his
insane
hate
for
his
enemy
and
by
his
stark
craving
for
vengeance
he
was
as
a
man
in
delirium
the
hideous
punishment
meted
out
to
him
had
no
visible
effect
on
his
maniac
strength
or
speed
his
madness
did
not
preclude
the
use
of
all
the
skill
he
could
muster
but
it
made
him
impervious
to
pain
and
to
shock
round
after
round
the
fight
slashed
on
while
the
crowd
screamed
and
pounded
in
delight
and
while
red
keegan
and
curly
watched
their
madman
with
anguished
eyes
willing
to
take
the
heaviest
blow
if
only
he
might
land
as
heavy
a
smash
in
return
dan
tore
away
at
his
foe
four
times
he
was
knocked
down
once
he
was
unconscious
for
five
seconds
but
borne
ever
onward
by
that
wild
urge
of
revenge
he
came
flying
back
to
the
combat
with
undiminished
fury
flesh
and
blood
could
not
stand
the
fearful
tax
indefinitely
through
all
his
mania
rorke
began
dimly
to
realise
that
there
was
a
trifle
less
crushing
vehemence
in
his
own
punches
and
less
whirlwind
speed
in
his
onslaught
with
every
atom
of
will
and
of
rage
and
of
resolve
in
his
whole
cosmos
he
scourged
himself
to
renewed
effort
the
welter
of
blows
avalanched
upon
him
unfelt
over
and
over
in
his
hot
brain
he
was
saying
watch
me
do
it
jeff
watch
me
do
it
and
he
fought
on
as
dan
reeled
back
to
his
corner
at
the
end
of
the
ninth
round
he
heard
as
from
miles
off
keegan
s
voice
whispering
to
him
try
out
the
good
old
stunts
danny
tain
t
too
late
even
yet
he
s
groggy
try
em
curly
tells
me
he
s
making
a
joke
of
how
he
killed
jeff
says
he
kicked
the
poor
purp
yesterday
too
when
he
met
him
in
the
street
he
dan
heard
no
more
the
minute
s
rest
was
over
almost
before
it
began
his
ears
ringing
with
the
tale
of
the
kick
he
plunged
back
into
the
fight
feltman
met
him
in
midring
a
horribly
battered
and
staggering
feltman
who
sought
to
improve
on
his
minute
s
rest
by
feinting
with
the
left
and
then
aiming
a
great
right
swing
for
the
head
the
swing
did
not
land
disregarding
the
feint
rorke
had
bored
in
the
swing
passed
beyond
him
while
his
two
fists
were
greedily
busy
with
infighting
at
his
tired
adversary
s
body
across
the
ring
and
to
the
ropes
with
all
his
ebbing
force
he
hammered
feltman
against
the
ropes
he
drove
him
then
as
feltman
rebounded
from
the
impact
dan
flung
every
remaining
sinew
of
strength
into
a
right
for
the
jaw
it
was
a
reckless
blow
except
as
a
counter
and
feltman
saw
it
coming
in
time
but
his
guard
would
not
obey
the
dazed
brain
s
mandate
quickly
enough
to
block
the
mighty
punch
rorke
s
right
fist
caught
his
opponent
flush
on
the
point
of
the
chin
and
feltman
sprawled
prone
on
his
face
quietly
he
lay
there
dead
to
the
world
while
the
referee
counted
at
the
count
of
eight
feltman
tried
instinctively
to
get
up
but
he
succeeded
only
in
rolling
over
on
his
back
cut
to
ribbons
bleeding
bruised
aching
and
all
but
blinded
dan
rorke
suffered
the
exultant
keegan
and
bud
to
guide
him
down
to
his
dressing
room
he
had
won
he
had
thrashed
the
man
who
had
poisoned
jeff
this
much
his
dizzy
senses
told
him
but
feltman
was
still
alive
and
jeff
was
dead
dan
s
heart
was
like
cold
lead
beneath
his
bruised
ribs
his
sensational
victory
was
as
ashes
and
dust
to
him
he
was
deaf
to
keegan
s
hysterical
adulation
nothing
mattered
bud
curly
swung
open
the
door
over
the
threshold
swept
a
whirlwind
of
gold
and
white
barking
rapturously
and
flinging
itself
upon
rorke
s
bleeding
chest
long
afterwards
dan
listened
with
a
foolish
grin
on
his
swollen
face
while
keegan
confessed
the
truly
keeganesque
trick
whereby
he
had
sought
to
lure
back
his
man
to
an
acceptance
of
the
foul
tactics
of
the
hiding
of
jeff
in
a
neighbour
s
cellar
for
the
day
and
the
spiriting
of
him
into
the
dressing
room
after
the
fight
began
of
the
coaching
of
curly
into
indorsing
the
tale
of
poison
and
of
bud
s
part
in
the
mock
grave
digging
a
digging
timed
nicely
to
coincide
with
dan
s
appearance
on
the
porch
all
this
much
later
but
for
the
instant
the
only
thing
dan
rorke
knew
was
that
his
dead
pet
or
its
ghost
it
did
not
matter
which
had
come
back
to
him
and
that
everything
was
once
more
tremendously
worth
while
and
that
the
world
was
a
gorgeous
place
to
do
one
s
living
in
forgetful
of
hurts
and
of
weakness
he
gathered
the
ecstatically
squirming
collie
into
his
battered
bare
arms
and
babbled
sobbingly
i
did
it
square
jeff
i
did
it
square
you
you
me
do
it
the
grudge
this
is
the
strange
yarn
of
three
dogs
if
the
dogs
had
been
humans
the
story
would
have
been
on
stage
and
screen
long
ago
frayne
s
farms
is
the
alliterative
name
for
the
tract
of
rich
bottom
land
in
the
shadow
of
the
ramapo
mountains
a
range
that
splits
north
jersey
s
farm
country
for
some
twenty
odd
miles
back
in
these
mountains
are
queer
folk
whose
exploits
sometimes
serve
as
a
page
story
for
some
sunday
newspaper
within
forty
miles
of
new
york
city
as
the
crow
flits
the
handful
of
mountaineers
are
as
primitive
as
any
south
sea
islanders
they
are
as
a
race
apart
and
with
their
own
barbarous
codes
and
customs
down
from
the
mountains
in
the
starvingly
barren
winter
time
every
few
years
a
band
of
huge
black
mongrel
dogs
used
to
swoop
upon
the
valley
harrying
it
from
end
to
end
in
search
of
food
and
leaving
a
trail
of
ravaged
henroosts
and
sheepfolds
in
their
wake
these
plunderers
were
the
black
dogs
of
the
mountaineers
dogs
blended
originally
from
a
tangle
of
diverse
breeds
hound
predominating
and
with
a
splash
of
in
their
rangy
carcases
when
famine
and
cold
gripped
the
folk
of
the
mountains
the
dogs
were
deprived
of
even
such
scanty
crusts
and
bones
as
were
their
summer
portion
and
under
the
goad
of
hunger
the
black
brutes
banded
for
a
raid
on
the
richer
pickings
of
the
valley
at
such
times
every
farmer
from
trask
frayne
to
the
members
of
the
italian
colony
up
would
arm
himself
and
join
the
hunt
rounding
up
the
horde
of
mongrels
they
would
shoot
fast
and
unerringly
such
few
members
of
the
pack
as
managed
to
break
through
the
cordon
and
make
a
dash
for
the
mountains
were
followed
hotly
up
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
grey
rocks
and
were
exterminated
by
trained
huntsmen
the
mountaineers
were
too
shrewd
to
make
any
effort
to
protect
their
and
pets
from
the
hunters
much
as
they
affected
to
despise
the
stolid
toilers
of
the
valley
yet
they
had
learned
from
more
than
one
bitter
and
long
bygone
experience
that
the
valley
men
were
not
safe
to
trifle
with
when
once
righteous
indignation
drove
them
to
the
warpath
for
years
after
such
a
battle
the
valley
was
wholly
free
from
the
marauding
pack
not
only
did
the
dogs
seem
to
shun
by
experience
the
peril
of
invading
the
lowlands
but
their
numbers
were
so
depleted
that
there
was
more
than
enough
food
for
all
of
the
few
survivors
in
the
meagre
garbage
of
the
mountain
shacks
not
until
numbers
and
forgetfulness
again
joined
hands
with
famine
did
the
pack
renew
its
valley
forays
when
this
story
begins
a
mere
two
years
had
passed
since
the
latest
of
the
mongrel
hunts
forty
farmers
and
hired
men
marshalled
and
led
by
young
trask
frayne
had
rounded
up
not
less
than
of
the
great
black
raiders
at
the
bank
of
the
frozen
little
ramapo
river
which
winds
along
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
wall
dividing
the
valley
from
the
savage
hinterland
the
pack
s
depredations
had
beaten
all
records
that
season
and
the
farmers
were
grimly
vengeful
mercilessly
they
had
poured
volley
after
volley
into
the
milling
swarm
of
freebooters
led
by
a
giant
dog
ebony
black
and
with
the
forequarters
of
a
timber
wolf
the
handful
of
remaining
pillagers
had
burst
through
the
cordon
and
crossed
the
river
to
the
safety
of
the
bleak
hills
it
was
trask
frayne
who
guided
the
posse
of
trackers
in
pursuit
for
the
best
part
of
two
days
the
farmers
kept
up
the
hunt
an
occasional
report
of
a
shotgun
would
be
wafted
to
the
valley
below
in
token
of
some
quarry
trailed
to
within
buckshot
range
the
gaunt
black
giant
leading
the
pack
seemed
to
be
invulnerable
no
less
than
five
times
during
that
pursuit
some
farmer
caught
momentary
sight
of
him
only
to
miss
aim
by
reason
of
the
beast
s
uncanny
craftiness
and
speed
trask
frayne
himself
was
able
to
take
a
hurried
shot
at
the
ebony
creature
as
the
fugitive
slunk
shadowlike
between
two
hillock
boulders
at
the
report
of
trask
s
gun
the
huge
mongrel
had
whirled
about
snarling
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
had
snapped
savagely
at
his
own
shoulder
where
a
single
buckshot
had
just
seared
a
jagged
groove
but
before
frayne
could
fire
a
second
shot
the
dog
had
vanished
thus
the
hunt
ended
nearly
all
the
black
dogs
of
the
mountaineers
had
met
the
death
penalty
it
was
the
most
thorough
and
successful
of
the
historic
list
of
such
battles
the
raiders
were
practically
exterminated
many
a
year
must
pass
before
the
pack
could
hope
again
to
muster
numbers
for
an
invasion
and
the
valley
breathed
easier
yet
trask
frayne
was
not
content
he
knew
as
it
is
given
to
few
humans
to
know
it
and
he
could
not
forget
the
wily
black
giant
that
had
led
the
band
of
mongrels
the
black
was
a
for
cunning
and
strength
and
elusiveness
that
had
been
proven
by
certain
features
of
the
raid
as
well
as
by
his
own
escape
from
the
hunters
and
the
black
still
lived
still
lived
and
with
no
worse
reminder
of
his
flight
than
a
on
one
mighty
shoulder
such
a
dog
was
a
menace
so
long
as
he
should
continue
alive
wherefore
trask
frayne
wanted
to
kick
himself
for
his
own
in
not
killing
him
and
he
was
obsessed
by
a
foreboding
that
the
valley
had
not
seen
the
last
of
the
black
he
could
not
explain
this
premonition
he
could
not
explain
it
even
to
himself
for
valley
history
showed
that
each
battle
served
as
a
wholesome
lesson
to
the
black
dogs
for
years
thereafter
never
between
forays
was
one
of
them
seen
on
the
hither
side
of
the
ramapo
yet
the
idea
would
not
get
out
of
frayne
s
head
trask
had
hated
the
necessary
job
of
destroying
the
mongrels
for
he
loved
dogs
nothing
short
of
stark
need
would
have
lured
him
into
shooting
one
of
them
his
own
two
thoroughbred
collies
and
wisp
were
honoured
members
of
the
frayne
household
dogs
of
the
same
breed
differ
as
much
in
character
as
do
humans
of
the
same
race
for
example
no
two
humans
could
have
been
more
widely
divergent
in
nature
than
were
these
two
collies
of
trask
s
was
mighty
of
coat
tawny
as
befitted
the
son
of
his
illustrious
sire
old
sunnybank
lad
of
purpose
and
staunchly
loyal
to
his
master
tam
was
as
steady
of
soul
as
a
rock
whether
guarding
the
or
rounding
up
a
bunch
of
scattered
sheep
that
had
broken
bounds
he
was
calmly
reliable
he
adored
trask
frayne
with
a
worship
that
was
none
the
less
because
it
was
so
undemonstrative
and
he
cared
for
nothing
and
nobody
else
on
earth
except
wisp
wisp
had
been
the
runt
of
a
thoroughbred
litter
he
was
slender
and
fragile
and
wholly
lovable
a
dainty
little
tricolour
scarce
forty
pounds
in
weight
not
strong
enough
for
heavy
work
yet
wisp
was
a
gallant
guard
and
a
gaily
affectionate
house
dog
the
cherished
pet
and
playfellow
of
the
three
frayne
babies
also
he
was
tam
s
dearest
friend
the
larger
collie
from
puppyhood
had
established
a
protection
over
wisp
ever
conceding
to
him
the
warmest
corner
of
the
winter
hearth
the
shadiest
spot
in
the
dooryard
in
summer
the
best
morsels
of
their
joint
daily
meal
he
would
descend
from
his
calm
loftiness
to
romp
with
the
frolicsome
wisp
though
the
sight
of
stately
tam
trying
to
romp
was
somehow
suggestive
of
marshal
joffre
playing
in
short
he
loved
wisp
as
he
loved
not
even
trask
frayne
more
than
once
in
the
village
when
a
stray
cur
misunderstood
wisp
s
gay
friendliness
and
showed
his
teeth
at
the
frail
little
dog
tam
so
far
departed
from
his
wonted
noble
dignity
as
to
hurl
himself
upon
the
aggressor
and
thrash
the
luckless
canine
into
howling
submission
he
was
wisp
s
guardian
as
well
as
his
dearest
comrade
once
in
a
very
great
while
such
inseparable
friendships
spring
up
between
two
collies
one
morning
in
june
trask
set
forth
for
suffern
with
a
flock
of
sixty
sheep
the
day
was
hot
and
the
journey
promised
to
be
tiresome
so
when
the
two
collies
had
worked
the
sixty
out
from
the
rest
of
the
frayne
bunch
of
sheep
and
had
started
them
bleating
and
milling
toward
the
highroad
trask
whistled
wisp
back
to
him
home
boy
he
ordered
patting
the
friendly
uplifted
head
and
playfully
rumpling
the
collie
s
silken
ears
back
home
and
take
care
of
things
there
it
s
a
long
hot
trip
for
a
pup
that
hasn
t
any
more
stamina
than
you
have
wispy
tam
and
i
can
handle
them
all
right
chase
back
home
the
soft
brown
eyes
of
the
collie
filled
with
infinitely
pathetic
pleading
wisp
understood
the
meaning
of
his
master
s
words
as
well
as
might
any
of
the
frayne
children
from
birth
he
had
been
talked
to
and
his
quick
brain
had
responded
as
does
every
clever
collie
s
wisp
knew
he
had
been
bidden
to
stay
at
home
from
this
delightful
outing
and
every
inch
of
his
body
as
well
as
his
eloquent
eyes
cried
aloud
in
appeal
to
be
taken
along
yet
when
once
more
frayne
petted
his
head
and
pointed
towards
the
dooryard
the
good
little
chap
turned
obediently
back
as
he
passed
tam
the
two
dogs
touched
noses
as
if
exchanging
speech
of
some
sort
as
perhaps
they
were
then
disconsolately
wisp
trotted
to
the
house
and
curled
up
on
the
doormat
in
a
small
and
furry
and
miserably
unhappy
heap
there
he
was
still
lying
his
sorrowful
eyes
fixed
on
his
master
and
on
his
chum
as
the
huddle
of
sheep
were
guided
out
of
the
gateway
into
the
highroad
beyond
glancing
back
frayne
smiled
encouragingly
at
the
pathetic
little
waiting
figure
at
the
door
tam
too
paused
as
he
manœuvred
the
last
silly
sheep
into
the
highroad
and
stood
beside
frayne
for
a
second
peering
back
at
his
chum
under
their
momentary
glance
wisp
made
shift
to
wag
his
plumy
tail
once
by
way
of
affectionate
farewell
long
afterward
trask
frayne
could
summon
up
memory
of
the
daintily
graceful
little
dog
lying
so
obediently
on
the
doormat
and
wagging
such
a
brave
goodbye
to
the
master
who
had
just
deprived
him
of
a
jolly
day
s
outing
possibly
the
picture
remained
in
s
memory
too
it
is
to
be
hoped
so
for
never
again
were
frayne
or
tam
to
see
their
lovable
little
collie
chum
dusk
was
sifting
down
the
valley
from
beyond
the
mountain
wall
that
afternoon
when
trask
frayne
turned
once
more
into
the
gateway
leading
to
his
farm
at
his
side
trotted
tam
it
had
been
a
hard
day
both
for
dog
and
man
at
best
it
is
no
light
task
to
marshal
a
flock
of
sixty
bolting
sheep
along
miles
of
winding
road
but
when
that
road
is
infested
with
terrifying
and
when
it
goes
past
two
or
three
and
a
railway
the
labour
is
spectacular
in
spots
and
arduous
at
all
times
but
at
last
thanks
to
tam
the
sheep
had
reached
suffern
without
a
single
mishap
and
had
been
driven
skilfully
into
the
the
homeward
tramp
had
been
by
contrast
a
mere
yet
both
the
collie
and
his
master
were
glad
of
the
prospect
of
rest
and
of
supper
frayne
reviewing
the
labour
of
the
day
was
pleased
with
his
own
foresight
in
making
wisp
stay
at
home
he
knew
such
an
ordeal
in
such
weather
would
have
tired
the
delicate
collie
half
to
death
coming
up
the
dusky
lane
from
the
house
to
meet
the
returning
wanderers
was
a
slender
woman
as
he
saw
her
frayne
waved
his
hat
and
hurried
forward
at
new
speed
thus
always
after
one
of
his
few
absences
from
home
his
pretty
young
wife
came
up
the
lane
to
welcome
him
and
as
ever
the
sight
of
her
made
him
forget
his
fatigue
yet
now
after
that
first
glance
worry
took
the
place
of
eagerness
in
frayne
s
mind
for
his
wife
was
advancing
slowly
and
spiritlessly
and
not
in
the
very
least
with
her
wonted
springy
walk
the
heat
s
been
too
much
for
her
he
muttered
worriedly
to
tam
it
s
been
a
broiling
day
she
ought
to
have
but
tam
was
no
longer
beside
him
the
big
collie
had
started
ahead
toward
the
oncoming
woman
usually
when
mildred
frayne
came
thus
to
greet
her
returning
husband
wisp
was
with
her
the
little
dog
would
bound
ahead
of
his
mistress
as
frayne
appeared
and
come
galloping
merrily
up
to
him
and
tam
tam
too
always
cantered
forward
to
touch
noses
with
his
chum
but
by
this
evening
s
dim
light
frayne
could
not
see
wisp
nor
did
tam
rush
forward
as
usual
instead
he
was
pacing
slowly
toward
mildred
with
head
and
tail
adroop
as
tam
had
turned
in
at
the
gate
beside
his
master
the
collie
had
come
to
a
convulsive
halt
his
nostrils
had
gone
upward
in
a
series
of
eagerly
suspicious
sniffs
then
his
shaggy
body
had
quivered
all
over
as
if
with
a
spasm
of
physical
pain
at
that
moment
mildred
s
figure
had
caught
his
wandering
eye
and
he
had
moved
forward
downcast
and
trembling
to
meet
her
it
was
tam
long
before
trask
who
discovered
that
mildred
was
weeping
and
this
phenomenon
for
the
instant
turned
his
attention
from
his
vain
search
for
wisp
and
from
the
confusingly
menacing
scents
which
had
just
assailed
his
nostrils
departing
from
his
lifelong
calm
the
big
dog
whined
softly
as
he
came
up
with
mildred
and
he
thrust
his
cold
muzzle
sympathisingly
into
her
hand
within
him
stirred
all
his
splendid
race
s
pitiful
yearning
to
comfort
a
human
in
grief
so
poignant
was
this
craving
that
it
almost
made
him
forget
the
increasingly
keen
scents
which
had
put
him
on
his
guard
when
he
came
in
through
the
gateway
hello
called
trask
cheerily
as
he
neared
his
wife
tired
dear
you
shouldn
t
have
bothered
to
walk
all
this
way
out
to
meet
me
after
a
rotten
day
like
this
you
ought
to
be
resting
where
s
wisp
is
he
disciplining
me
for
making
him
stay
home
i
then
he
too
saw
mildred
was
crying
and
before
he
could
speak
again
she
had
thrown
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
was
sobbing
out
an
incoherent
story
broken
by
an
occasional
involuntary
shiver
holding
her
close
to
him
and
asking
eagerly
futile
questions
trask
frayne
bit
by
bit
drew
forth
the
reason
for
her
grief
harry
and
janet
the
two
older
children
had
gone
down
to
the
river
that
noon
to
fish
off
the
dock
for
perch
mildred
at
an
upper
window
where
she
was
sewing
had
watched
them
from
time
to
time
for
the
river
was
high
and
rapid
from
recent
rains
but
wisp
was
with
them
and
she
had
experience
in
the
little
collie
s
sleepless
care
over
the
youngsters
more
than
once
indoors
wisp
had
thrust
his
own
slight
body
between
a
frayne
child
and
the
fire
again
and
again
at
the
dock
he
had
interposed
his
puny
bulk
and
had
shoved
with
all
his
force
when
one
or
another
of
the
babies
ventured
too
close
to
the
edge
as
she
looked
up
from
her
sewing
she
had
seen
the
trio
leave
the
dock
and
start
homeward
janet
had
been
in
the
lead
swinging
the
string
of
perch
and
sunfish
and
shiners
they
had
caught
they
had
skirted
a
riverside
thicket
on
their
way
to
the
out
from
the
bushes
had
sprung
a
gigantic
lean
dog
jet
black
except
for
a
patch
of
white
on
one
shoulder
the
wind
had
been
strong
in
the
other
direction
so
no
scent
of
the
dog
had
reached
wisp
who
was
dawdling
along
a
bit
to
the
rear
of
the
children
the
black
had
made
a
lightning
grab
at
the
carelessly
swung
string
of
fish
and
had
snatched
them
away
from
janet
as
he
turned
to
bolt
back
into
the
thicket
with
his
stolen
feast
harry
had
caught
up
a
stick
and
had
charged
in
pursuit
of
the
string
of
fish
the
child
had
brought
his
stick
down
with
a
resounding
thwack
on
the
head
of
the
escaping
beast
the
blow
must
have
stung
for
instantly
the
black
dropped
the
fish
and
leaped
upon
the
tiny
chap
all
this
in
a
single
second
or
less
but
before
the
mongrel
s
teeth
could
reach
their
mark
wisp
had
flashed
past
the
two
startled
children
and
had
launched
his
weak
body
straight
at
the
black
s
throat
down
went
the
two
dogs
in
a
tearing
snarling
heap
mildred
realising
how
hopelessly
unequal
was
the
contest
had
run
to
the
aid
of
her
beloved
wisp
fleeing
downstairs
she
had
snatched
trask
s
gun
from
its
peg
above
the
mantel
had
seized
at
random
a
handful
of
shells
and
ran
out
of
the
house
and
towards
the
river
loading
the
gun
as
she
went
by
the
time
she
came
in
sight
the
black
had
already
recovered
the
advantage
he
had
lost
by
wisp
s
unexpected
spring
by
dint
of
strength
and
of
weight
he
had
torn
himself
free
of
wisp
s
weak
grip
had
flung
the
lighter
dog
to
earth
and
had
pinned
him
there
right
gallantly
did
little
wisp
battle
in
the
viselike
grasp
of
the
giant
fiercely
he
strove
to
bite
at
the
rending
jaws
and
to
rip
free
from
the
crushing
weight
above
him
but
as
ever
mere
courage
could
not
atone
for
dearth
of
brute
strength
and
ferocity
undeterred
by
his
foe
s
puny
efforts
or
by
the
fusillade
of
blows
from
harry
s
stick
and
from
janet
s
pudgy
fists
the
black
had
slung
wisp
to
one
side
and
had
lunged
once
more
at
him
this
time
he
found
the
mark
he
sought
the
back
of
the
neck
just
below
the
base
of
the
brain
he
threw
all
his
vast
into
one
terrific
bite
and
little
wisp
s
frantic
struggles
ceased
the
valiant
collie
lay
inert
and
moveless
his
neck
broken
maddened
by
conquest
the
black
tossed
the
lifeless
body
in
air
it
came
to
ground
on
the
edge
of
the
river
there
from
the
momentum
of
the
toss
it
had
rebounded
into
the
water
the
swift
current
had
caught
it
and
borne
it
downstream
then
for
the
first
time
the
black
seemed
to
realise
that
both
frantically
screaming
children
were
showering
futile
blows
on
him
with
a
snarl
he
turned
on
harry
but
as
he
did
so
mildred
s
flying
feet
brought
her
within
range
halting
she
raised
the
gun
and
fired
she
was
a
good
shot
and
excitement
had
not
robbed
her
aim
of
steadiness
but
excitement
had
made
her
catch
up
a
handful
of
cartridges
loaded
lightly
with
number
eight
shot
instead
of
anything
more
deadly
the
small
pellets
buzzed
hornetlike
about
the
black
s
head
and
shoulders
several
of
them
stinging
hotly
but
at
that
distance
the
birdshot
could
do
no
lasting
damage
nor
did
any
of
it
chance
to
reach
one
of
his
eyes
with
a
yell
of
pain
he
wheeled
to
face
the
woman
and
she
let
him
have
the
second
barrel
memories
of
former
clashes
with
gunners
seemed
to
wake
in
the
brute
s
crafty
brain
snarling
snapping
shaking
his
tormented
head
he
turned
and
plunged
into
the
narrow
river
gaining
the
farther
bank
and
diving
into
the
waterside
bushes
before
mildred
could
think
to
reload
the
balance
of
the
day
had
been
spent
in
a
vain
search
of
the
bank
downstream
for
wisp
s
lost
body
and
in
trying
to
comfort
the
children
not
until
she
had
gotten
the
babies
to
bed
and
had
soothed
them
to
sleep
did
mildred
have
scope
to
think
of
her
own
grief
in
the
loss
of
the
gentle
dog
who
had
been
so
dear
to
her
he
he
gave
his
life
for
them
she
finished
her
sobbing
recital
he
knew
he
have
known
that
he
had
no
chance
against
that
horrible
monster
and
wisp
had
never
fought
you
know
from
the
day
he
was
born
he
knew
that
brute
would
kill
him
and
he
never
hesitated
at
all
he
gave
his
life
for
the
children
and
and
we
can
t
can
t
even
say
a
prayer
over
his
grave
but
trask
frayne
just
then
was
not
thinking
of
prayers
deep
down
in
his
throat
he
was
cursing
softly
but
with
much
venom
and
the
nails
of
his
fists
bit
deep
into
his
palms
black
with
a
white
scar
on
the
shoulder
he
said
at
last
his
own
harsh
voice
not
unlike
a
dog
s
growl
hound
ears
and
the
build
of
a
almost
as
big
as
a
dane
and
h
m
that
s
my
on
his
shoulder
that
white
mark
morning
i
m
going
hunting
up
in
the
mountains
want
to
come
along
tam
but
as
before
tam
was
not
there
when
his
master
turned
to
speak
to
him
the
collie
had
waited
only
long
enough
to
note
that
the
task
of
comforting
the
weeping
mildred
had
been
taken
over
by
more
expert
powers
than
his
then
he
had
trotted
off
towards
the
house
not
only
to
solve
the
problem
of
these
sinister
scents
which
hung
so
heavy
on
the
moist
night
air
but
to
find
his
chum
wisp
circling
the
house
he
caught
wisp
s
trail
it
was
some
hours
old
but
by
no
means
too
cold
to
be
followed
by
a
collie
whose
scenting
powers
had
once
tracked
a
lost
sheep
for
five
miles
through
a
blizzard
with
wisp
s
trail
was
mingled
that
of
two
of
the
children
and
it
led
to
the
true
there
were
other
trails
of
wisp
s
that
the
sensitive
nostrils
caught
but
all
of
them
were
older
than
this
which
led
to
the
water
therefore
as
any
tracking
dog
would
have
known
wisp
had
gone
riverward
since
he
had
been
near
the
house
and
down
the
path
nose
to
ground
followed
he
did
not
move
with
his
wonted
stolidity
for
over
and
above
the
mere
trail
scent
his
nostrils
were
assailed
by
other
and
more
distressingly
foreboding
smells
the
smells
he
had
caught
as
he
had
entered
the
gate
the
smells
which
grew
ranker
at
every
loping
step
he
took
in
half
a
minute
he
was
at
the
bank
and
before
that
time
he
had
abandoned
the
tracking
for
now
all
around
him
was
that
terrible
scent
back
and
forth
dashed
and
circled
and
doubled
tam
and
every
evolution
told
him
more
of
the
gruesome
story
here
among
the
bushes
had
lain
a
strange
animal
an
unwashen
and
pungent
and
huge
animal
apparently
sleeping
after
a
gorge
of
chicken
or
lamb
here
along
the
path
had
come
the
children
with
wisp
behind
them
here
the
strange
dog
had
leapt
forth
and
here
alongside
that
string
of
forgotten
and
fish
on
the
ground
wisp
and
the
stranger
had
clashed
the
dullest
of
scents
could
have
told
the
story
from
that
point
the
trampled
earth
the
spatters
of
dried
blood
the
indentation
in
the
grass
where
wisp
s
writhing
body
had
striven
so
heroically
to
free
itself
from
the
crushing
weight
above
it
and
to
renew
the
hopeless
battle
wisp
was
dead
he
was
slain
by
that
huge
and
creature
his
body
had
touched
the
fully
five
feet
from
the
scene
of
the
fight
after
that
it
had
disappeared
for
running
water
will
not
hold
a
scent
yes
wisp
was
dead
he
had
been
murdered
he
had
been
murdered
this
adored
chum
of
his
by
the
great
beast
whose
scent
was
already
graven
so
indelibly
on
tam
s
heartsick
memory
there
at
the
a
few
minutes
later
trask
frayne
found
padding
restlessly
about
from
spot
to
spot
of
the
tragedy
whimpering
under
his
breath
but
the
whimper
carried
no
hint
of
pathos
rather
was
it
the
expression
of
a
wrath
that
lay
too
deep
for
mere
growling
at
his
master
s
touch
the
great
collie
started
nervously
and
shrunk
away
from
the
caress
he
had
always
craved
and
his
furtively
swift
motion
in
eluding
the
loved
hand
savoured
far
more
of
the
wolf
than
of
the
trained
house
dog
the
collie
in
look
and
in
action
had
reverted
to
the
wild
tam
trotted
for
the
tenth
time
to
the
spot
at
the
where
the
black
had
bounded
into
the
water
impatiently
always
with
that
queer
little
throaty
whimper
he
cast
up
and
down
along
the
bank
in
quest
of
some
place
where
wisp
s
slayer
might
perhaps
have
doubled
back
to
land
presently
trask
called
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
blameless
life
tam
hesitated
before
obeying
he
was
standing
in
the
swirling
water
sniffing
the
air
and
peering
through
the
dusk
along
the
wooded
banks
on
the
far
side
of
the
stream
again
and
more
imperatively
frayne
called
him
with
visible
distaste
the
collie
turned
and
made
his
way
back
towards
his
master
frayne
had
finished
his
own
fruitless
investigations
and
was
starting
homeward
to
the
house
he
paused
and
looked
back
tam
had
ceased
to
follow
him
and
was
staring
once
more
at
the
patches
of
trampled
and
dyed
earth
a
third
and
sharper
call
from
trask
brought
the
collie
to
heel
i
don
t
blame
you
old
boy
said
frayne
as
they
made
their
way
towards
the
lighted
kitchen
but
you
can
t
find
him
that
way
you
and
i
are
going
to
take
a
little
trip
through
the
mountains
i
d
rather
have
your
help
on
a
hunt
like
that
than
any
hound
s
you
won
t
forget
his
scent
in
a
hurry
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
what
he
s
on
the
way
to
the
house
frayne
paused
at
the
sheepfold
and
made
a
careful
detour
of
it
but
the
inspection
satisfied
him
that
the
fence
built
long
ago
with
special
regard
to
the
mountainpack
s
forays
was
still
too
stout
to
permit
of
any
dog
s
breaking
through
it
and
he
passed
on
to
the
house
again
having
to
summon
the
collie
from
an
attempt
to
go
back
to
the
river
he
won
t
pay
us
another
visit
tam
he
told
the
sullen
dog
as
they
went
indoors
he
s
tricky
and
if
he
s
really
on
the
rampage
here
in
the
valley
he
ll
strike
next
in
some
place
miles
away
from
here
wait
till
but
once
more
tam
did
not
follow
his
overlord
s
bidding
for
at
dawn
of
the
morrow
when
trask
came
out
of
the
house
shotgun
in
hand
the
dog
was
nowhere
to
be
found
never
before
had
tam
forsaken
his
duties
as
guardian
of
the
farm
to
wander
afield
without
frayne
the
jingle
of
the
telephone
brought
trask
back
into
the
house
on
the
other
end
of
the
wire
was
an
irate
farmer
i
m
sending
word
all
along
the
line
came
his
message
last
night
a
dog
bust
into
my
hencoop
and
killed
every
last
one
of
my
prize
hamburgs
and
other
chickens
besides
he
worked
as
quiet
as
a
fox
twasn
t
till
i
heard
a
chicken
squawk
that
i
came
out
that
must
have
been
the
last
of
the
lot
and
the
dog
had
got
careless
i
had
just
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
sneaked
off
in
the
dark
great
big
cuss
he
was
as
big
as
a
house
looked
something
like
a
wolf
by
that
bum
light
and
something
like
a
collie
too
last
evening
i
got
news
that
gryce
up
lost
a
lamb
night
before
from
some
prowling
dog
d
you
s
pose
the
dogs
from
the
mountains
is
loose
again
one
of
them
is
returned
frayne
i
m
going
after
him
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
gun
under
arm
made
his
way
to
the
scow
lying
at
the
side
of
the
dock
crossing
the
river
he
explored
the
bank
for
a
half
mile
in
both
directions
failing
to
find
sign
or
trail
of
the
black
he
struck
into
the
mountains
it
was
late
that
night
when
trask
slouched
wearily
into
his
own
house
and
laid
aside
his
gun
any
trace
of
him
asked
mildred
eagerly
not
a
trace
answered
frayne
i
quartered
the
range
farther
back
than
we
ever
hunted
before
and
i
asked
a
lot
of
questions
at
that
mountaineer
settlement
up
there
that
s
all
the
good
it
did
i
might
hunt
for
a
year
and
not
get
any
track
of
the
beast
those
mountaineers
are
all
liars
of
course
not
one
of
em
would
admit
they
d
ever
seen
or
heard
of
the
dog
if
i
d
had
tam
with
me
i
might
have
caught
the
trail
i
ll
see
he
goes
along
he
tam
repeated
mildred
in
surprise
why
wasn
t
he
with
you
he
hasn
t
been
home
all
day
he
hasn
t
been
home
do
you
mean
to
say
he
didn
t
come
back
no
said
his
wife
worriedly
when
i
got
up
this
morning
and
found
you
both
gone
i
thought
of
course
you
d
taken
him
along
as
you
said
you
were
going
to
didn
t
he
wasn
t
anywhere
around
when
i
started
replied
frayne
he
s
he
s
never
been
away
for
a
whole
day
or
even
for
a
whole
hour
before
i
wonder
oh
do
you
suppose
that
horrible
brute
has
killed
tam
too
quavered
mildred
in
new
terror
not
he
trask
reassured
her
not
he
or
any
other
mortal
dog
but
he
hesitated
then
went
on
shamefacedly
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
think
i
believe
tam
has
gone
hunting
on
his
own
account
i
believe
he
s
trailing
that
mongrel
if
he
is
he
has
a
man
s
size
job
cut
out
for
him
for
the
black
is
as
tricky
as
a
weasel
tam
thought
more
of
wisp
than
he
thought
of
anything
else
and
he
was
like
another
animal
when
he
found
what
had
happened
down
yonder
take
my
word
for
it
he
is
after
the
dog
that
murdered
his
chum
whether
he
ll
ever
get
him
is
another
matter
but
if
he
really
is
after
him
he
ll
never
give
up
the
hunt
as
long
as
he
has
a
breath
of
life
left
in
him
either
he
ll
overhaul
the
cur
or
well
either
that
or
we
ll
never
see
him
again
there
s
no
sense
in
my
poking
around
in
the
mountains
without
him
all
we
can
do
is
wait
that
and
try
to
find
tam
and
chain
him
up
till
he
forgets
this
crazy
but
even
though
the
fraynes
did
not
see
their
cherished
collie
when
they
arose
next
morning
they
did
not
lack
for
news
of
him
in
the
middle
of
a
silent
and
doleful
breakfast
a
telephone
ring
summoned
trask
from
the
table
that
you
frayne
queried
a
truculent
voice
this
is
trippler
at
darlington
i
got
rotten
news
for
you
but
it
s
a
whole
lot
rottener
for
last
night
my
was
raided
by
a
dog
he
killed
two
of
the
jersey
calves
and
pretty
near
ripped
the
throat
out
of
one
of
my
yearlings
i
heard
the
racket
and
i
ran
out
with
my
gun
and
a
flashlight
the
looked
like
a
battlefield
the
dog
had
skipped
couldn
t
see
a
sign
of
him
anywheres
but
about
half
an
hour
later
he
came
back
he
came
back
while
i
was
redding
up
the
yard
and
trying
to
quiet
the
scared
critters
he
came
right
to
the
gate
and
stood
sniffing
there
as
bold
as
brass
like
he
was
trying
to
catch
the
scent
of
more
of
my
stock
to
kill
i
heard
his
feet
and
i
turned
the
flashlight
on
him
he
was
dog
frayne
that
big
dark
coloured
collie
dog
of
yours
i
saw
him
as
plain
as
day
i
upped
with
my
gun
and
i
let
him
have
it
for
i
was
pretty
sore
but
i
must
have
missed
him
clean
for
there
wasn
t
any
blood
near
his
footprints
in
the
mud
when
i
looked
he
just
lit
out
but
i
m
calling
up
to
tell
you
you
ll
have
a
big
bill
to
pay
on
this
and
hold
on
interrupted
frayne
quietly
i
ll
be
up
there
in
twenty
minutes
as
fast
as
his
car
could
carry
him
trask
made
his
way
up
the
valley
to
darlington
and
to
the
trippler
farm
there
an
irately
unloving
host
awaited
him
before
you
go
telling
me
the
whole
story
all
over
again
trask
broke
in
on
an
explosive
recital
take
me
over
to
the
exact
spot
where
you
saw
tam
standing
and
sniffing
the
ground
all
around
here
is
soaked
from
the
shower
we
had
last
evening
i
want
to
see
the
tracks
you
were
speaking
muttering
dire
threats
and
whining
lamentations
for
his
lost
calves
trippler
led
the
way
to
the
pointing
presently
to
a
gap
in
the
privet
hedge
which
shut
off
the
barns
from
the
truck
garden
frayne
went
over
to
the
gap
and
proceeded
to
inspect
the
muddy
earth
inch
by
inch
it
was
here
tam
stood
when
you
turned
the
light
on
him
he
asked
right
just
there
declared
trippler
and
i
c
n
swear
to
him
he
come
over
here
invited
trask
there
are
his
footprints
as
you
said
and
i
d
know
them
anywhere
there
s
no
other
dog
of
his
size
with
such
tiny
feet
he
gets
them
from
his
sire
sunnybank
lad
those
are
tam
s
footprints
i
admit
that
i
d
know
them
anywhere
even
if
they
didn
t
show
the
gash
in
the
outer
pad
of
the
left
forefoot
where
he
gouged
himself
on
barbed
wire
when
he
was
a
you
admit
it
was
him
then
orated
trippler
that
s
all
i
need
to
hear
you
say
now
how
much
no
no
gently
denied
frayne
it
isn
t
anywhere
near
all
you
need
to
hear
now
let
s
go
back
into
the
as
i
crossed
it
just
now
i
saw
dozens
of
among
the
of
the
calves
let
s
take
another
look
at
grumblingly
yet
eager
to
add
this
corroboratory
evidence
trippler
followed
him
to
the
wallow
of
churned
mud
which
marked
the
scene
of
slaughter
at
the
first
clearly
defined
set
of
footprints
trask
halted
take
a
good
look
at
those
he
adjured
study
them
carefully
here
these
for
instance
where
the
dog
planted
all
fours
firmly
for
a
spring
they
re
the
marks
of
splay
feet
a
third
larger
than
tam
s
and
not
one
of
them
has
that
gash
in
the
pad
the
one
i
pointed
out
to
you
back
at
the
gap
look
for
nonsense
fumed
trippler
albeit
a
shade
uneasily
as
he
stood
up
stiffly
after
a
peering
study
of
the
prints
anyhow
he
went
on
all
it
proves
is
that
there
was
two
of
em
this
big
cuss
and
your
collie
they
was
working
in
couples
like
killers
often
were
they
frayne
caught
him
up
were
they
then
suppose
you
look
carefully
all
through
this
welter
of
mud
and
see
if
you
can
find
a
single
footprint
of
tarn
s
and
while
you
re
looking
let
me
tell
you
as
trippler
went
over
the
yard
s
mud
with
gimlet
eyes
trask
related
the
story
of
wisp
s
killing
and
his
own
theory
as
to
tam
he
s
trailing
that
black
dog
he
finished
he
struck
his
scent
somewhere
and
followed
him
he
got
here
a
too
late
and
then
when
you
fired
at
him
he
run
off
to
pick
up
the
trail
again
but
i
doubt
if
he
got
it
for
the
black
would
probably
be
cunning
enough
to
take
to
the
river
after
a
raid
like
this
he
d
have
sense
enough
to
know
somebody
would
track
him
that
brute
has
true
maybe
maybe
you
re
right
hesitated
trippler
after
a
minute
search
of
the
yard
had
failed
to
reveal
a
footprint
corresponding
with
tam
s
and
the
county
s
got
to
pay
for
any
damage
done
to
stock
by
an
unknown
that
s
the
law
i
m
kind
of
glad
too
you
see
i
like
old
tam
besides
i
c
n
c
llect
more
damages
from
the
county
than
i
c
d
c
llect
from
a
lawsoot
with
a
neighbour
what
ll
we
do
now
fix
up
a
posse
like
we
did
the
other
times
no
replied
trask
it
would
do
no
good
the
black
is
too
clever
and
in
summer
there
are
too
many
ways
to
throw
off
the
scent
tam
will
get
him
if
anyone
can
let
s
leave
it
to
but
other
farmers
were
not
so
well
content
to
leave
the
punishment
of
the
mysterious
raider
to
tam
as
the
days
went
on
there
were
more
and
more
tidings
of
the
killer
up
and
down
the
valley
he
worked
never
twice
in
succession
in
the
same
vicinity
twice
an
hour
or
so
after
his
visits
men
saw
tam
prowling
along
the
mongrel
s
cooling
tracks
they
reported
to
frayne
that
the
collie
had
grown
lean
and
gaunt
and
that
his
beautiful
coat
was
one
mass
of
briar
and
burr
and
that
he
had
slunk
away
when
they
called
to
him
frayne
himself
caught
no
slightest
sight
of
his
beloved
dog
though
occasionally
in
the
mornings
he
found
empty
the
dish
of
food
he
had
set
out
on
the
previous
night
trask
was
working
out
the
problem
for
himself
nowadays
deaf
to
all
requests
that
he
head
another
band
of
hunters
into
the
mountains
he
was
getting
no
sleep
to
speak
of
but
he
was
thrilling
with
the
suspense
of
what
sportsmen
know
as
the
still
every
evening
when
his
chores
and
his
supper
were
finished
frayne
went
to
the
sheepfold
and
led
thence
a
fat
wether
that
had
a
real
genius
for
loud
bleating
this
vocal
sheep
he
would
tether
to
a
stake
near
the
then
he
himself
would
study
the
trend
of
the
faint
evening
breeze
and
would
take
up
a
position
in
the
bushes
somewhere
to
leeward
of
the
sheep
there
gun
across
knees
he
would
sit
until
early
daylight
sometimes
he
dozed
oftener
he
crouched
tense
and
wakeful
in
his
covert
straining
his
eyes
through
the
gloom
for
the
sight
of
a
slinking
black
shadow
creeping
towards
the
decoy
not
alone
to
avenge
the
death
of
wisp
and
to
rid
the
valley
of
a
scourge
did
he
spend
his
nights
in
this
way
he
knew
tam
as
only
a
born
dogman
can
know
his
dog
he
missed
the
collie
keenly
and
he
had
solid
faith
that
on
the
death
of
the
black
the
miserable
quest
would
end
and
tam
would
return
to
his
old
home
and
to
his
old
habits
so
night
after
night
frayne
would
keep
his
vigil
morning
after
morning
he
would
plod
home
there
to
hear
a
telephoned
tale
of
the
black
s
depredations
at
some
other
point
of
the
valley
at
first
his
nightly
watch
was
kept
in
dense
darkness
but
soon
the
waxing
moon
lightened
the
and
made
the
first
hours
of
the
sentry
duty
easier
frayne
began
to
lose
faith
in
his
own
scheme
he
had
an
odd
feeling
that
the
black
somehow
knew
of
his
presence
in
the
thicket
and
that
frayne
s
farms
was
left
unvisited
for
that
reason
trask
s
immunity
from
the
black
s
depredations
was
the
theme
of
much
neighboured
talk
as
time
went
on
once
more
was
revived
trippler
s
theory
that
tam
and
the
black
were
hunting
in
couples
and
that
the
collie
like
so
many
dogs
which
have
gone
bad
was
sparing
his
late
master
s
property
on
all
these
unpleasant
themes
trask
frayne
was
brooding
one
night
late
in
the
month
as
he
sat
in
uncomfortable
stillness
amid
the
bushes
and
stared
glumly
out
at
the
wether
he
had
had
a
hard
day
and
the
weeks
of
were
beginning
to
tell
cruelly
on
him
his
senses
had
taken
to
tricking
him
of
late
for
instance
at
one
moment
this
night
he
was
crouching
there
waiting
patiently
for
the
full
moon
to
rise
above
the
eastern
hills
to
brighten
his
vigil
the
next
moment
though
he
was
certain
he
had
not
closed
his
eyes
the
moon
had
risen
and
was
riding
high
in
the
clear
heavens
frayne
started
a
little
and
blinked
as
he
did
so
his
disturbed
mind
told
him
he
had
not
awakened
naturally
but
that
he
had
been
disturbed
by
some
sound
he
shifted
his
drowsy
gaze
towards
the
tethered
sheep
and
at
once
all
slumber
was
wiped
from
his
brain
the
wether
was
lying
sprawled
on
the
ground
in
a
posture
that
nature
neither
intends
nor
permits
its
upflung
legs
were
still
jerking
convulsively
like
galvanised
stilts
and
above
it
was
bending
a
huge
dark
shape
the
moon
beat
down
mercilessly
on
the
tableau
of
the
slain
sheep
and
of
the
black
with
his
fangs
buried
deep
in
the
twisting
throat
now
that
the
moment
had
at
last
come
trask
found
himself
seized
by
an
unaccountable
numbness
of
mind
and
of
body
by
a
mighty
effort
he
regained
control
of
his
faculties
slowly
and
in
utter
silence
he
lifted
the
cocked
gun
from
his
knees
and
put
its
butt
to
the
hollow
of
his
shoulder
the
black
looked
up
in
quick
suspicion
from
his
meal
even
in
the
excitement
of
the
instant
frayne
found
scope
to
wonder
at
the
brute
s
ability
to
hear
so
noiseless
a
motion
and
his
finger
sought
the
trigger
then
in
a
flash
he
knew
why
the
black
s
great
head
had
lurched
so
suddenly
up
from
the
interrupted
meal
from
out
a
clump
of
alder
twenty
feet
to
shoreward
of
the
orgy
whirled
a
tawny
shape
with
the
speed
of
a
flung
spear
it
sped
straight
for
the
feasting
mongrel
and
in
the
mere
breath
of
time
it
took
to
dash
through
the
intervening
patch
of
moonlight
frayne
recognised
the
newcomer
the
black
sprang
up
from
beside
the
dead
sheep
and
faced
the
foe
he
could
no
longer
elude
barely
had
he
gained
his
feet
when
tam
was
upon
him
yet
the
mongrel
was
not
taken
unaware
his
crafty
brain
was
alert
and
the
master
of
his
sinewy
body
as
tam
leaped
the
black
dog
reared
to
meet
him
then
in
practically
the
same
gesture
the
black
shifted
his
direction
and
dived
beneath
the
charging
collie
lunging
for
the
latter
s
unprotected
stomach
it
was
a
manœuvre
worthy
of
a
wolf
and
one
against
which
the
average
dog
must
have
been
helpless
but
the
black
s
opponent
was
a
collie
and
in
the
back
of
his
brain
though
never
in
his
chivalric
heart
a
collie
is
forever
reverting
to
his
own
wolf
ancestors
thus
as
the
black
changed
the
course
of
his
lunge
tam
in
changed
his
by
a
violent
twist
of
every
whalebone
muscle
tam
whirled
himself
sidewise
and
the
black
s
ravening
jaws
closed
on
nothing
in
another
instant
even
before
he
had
touched
ground
tam
had
slashed
with
his
curving
eyeteeth
this
is
another
trick
known
to
practically
no
animal
save
the
wolf
and
the
wolf
s
direct
descendant
the
collie
the
razorlike
teeth
cut
the
black
s
left
ear
and
cheek
as
cleanly
as
might
a
blade
but
in
the
same
motion
the
black
s
flying
head
had
veered
and
his
jaws
had
found
a
hold
above
tam
s
jugular
again
with
the
normal
dog
such
a
hold
might
well
have
ended
the
fight
but
the
providence
which
ordained
that
a
collie
should
guard
sheep
on
icy
highland
moors
also
gave
him
an
unbelievably
thick
coat
to
fend
off
the
weather
and
this
coat
serves
as
an
almost
invulnerable
armour
especially
at
the
side
of
the
throat
the
black
s
teeth
closed
upon
a
quantity
of
tangled
fur
but
on
only
the
merest
patch
of
skin
and
on
none
of
the
under
flesh
at
all
tam
ripped
himself
free
leaving
a
double
handful
of
ruff
between
the
black
s
grinding
jaws
as
the
mongrel
spat
out
the
encumbering
gag
of
fur
tam
s
curved
fang
laid
bare
the
scarred
shoulder
once
grazed
by
trask
frayne
s
buckshot
and
in
a
rolling
fighting
heap
the
two
enemies
rolled
over
and
over
together
on
the
grass
frayne
s
gun
was
levelled
but
the
man
did
not
dare
fire
by
that
deceptive
light
he
had
no
assurance
of
hitting
one
dog
without
also
killing
the
other
and
chafing
at
his
own
impotence
he
stood
watching
the
battle
both
dogs
were
on
their
feet
again
rearing
and
rending
in
mute
fury
no
sound
issued
from
the
lips
of
either
this
was
no
mere
dogfight
as
noisy
as
it
was
pugnacious
it
was
a
struggle
to
the
death
and
the
dogs
realised
it
thrice
more
the
black
struck
for
the
jugular
twice
thanks
to
tam
s
lightning
quickness
he
scored
a
clean
miss
the
third
time
he
annexed
only
another
handful
of
hair
with
his
slashes
he
was
luckier
one
of
tam
s
forelegs
was
bleeding
freely
so
was
a
cut
on
his
stomach
where
the
black
had
sought
to
disembowel
him
and
one
side
of
his
muzzle
was
laid
open
but
the
collie
had
given
over
such
mere
fencing
tactics
as
slashing
he
was
tearing
into
his
powerful
and
wily
foe
with
all
the
concentrated
fury
of
his
month
s
vain
pursuit
of
vengeance
the
black
dived
for
the
collie
s
forelegs
seeking
to
crack
their
bones
in
his
mighty
jaws
and
thus
render
his
foe
helpless
nimbly
tam
s
tiny
white
forefeet
whisked
away
from
the
peril
of
each
dive
in
redoubled
fury
he
drove
for
the
throat
and
the
two
clashed
shoulder
to
shoulder
then
amid
the
welter
came
the
final
phase
of
the
fight
the
black
as
the
two
reared
lunged
again
for
the
collie
s
hurt
throat
tam
jerked
his
head
and
neck
aside
to
avoid
the
grip
and
as
once
before
the
black
changed
the
direction
of
his
lunge
with
the
swiftness
of
a
striking
snake
he
made
the
change
and
before
the
other
could
thwart
or
so
much
as
divine
his
purpose
he
had
secured
the
coveted
hold
far
up
on
tam
s
left
foreleg
no
mere
snap
or
slash
this
but
a
death
grip
the
black
s
teeth
sank
deep
into
the
captured
leg
grinding
with
a
force
which
presently
must
snap
the
bones
of
the
upper
leg
and
leave
the
collie
crippled
against
a
practically
uninjured
and
terrible
antagonist
the
rest
would
be
slaughter
tam
knew
his
own
mortal
peril
he
knew
it
even
before
trask
frayne
came
rushing
out
from
his
brandishing
the
gun
the
collie
did
not
try
to
wrench
free
and
thereby
to
hurry
the
process
of
breaking
his
leg
or
of
tearing
out
the
he
thought
as
quickly
as
the
mongrel
had
lunged
rearing
his
head
aloft
he
drove
down
at
the
black
the
latter
was
clinging
with
all
his
might
to
the
collie
s
foreleg
and
in
the
rapture
of
having
gained
at
last
a
disabling
grip
he
ignored
the
fact
that
he
had
left
an
opening
in
his
own
defence
an
opening
seldom
sought
in
a
fight
except
by
a
wolf
or
a
wolf
s
descendant
it
was
for
this
opening
that
struck
in
a
trice
his
white
teeth
had
buried
themselves
in
the
exposed
nape
of
the
black
s
neck
here
at
the
brain
s
base
lies
the
spinal
cord
dangerously
within
reach
of
long
and
fangs
and
here
tam
had
fastened
himself
an
instant
later
but
an
instant
too
late
the
black
knew
his
peril
releasing
his
grip
on
the
collie
s
leg
before
the
bone
had
begun
to
yield
he
threw
his
great
body
madly
from
side
to
side
fighting
crazily
to
shake
off
the
with
all
his
mighty
strength
he
thrashed
about
twice
he
lifted
the
collie
clean
off
the
ground
once
he
fell
with
tam
under
him
but
the
collie
held
on
tam
did
more
than
hold
on
exerting
every
remaining
atom
of
his
waning
power
he
let
his
body
be
flung
here
and
there
in
the
black
s
struggles
and
he
concentrated
his
force
upon
cleaving
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
this
was
the
grip
whereby
the
black
a
month
agone
had
crushed
the
life
out
of
friendly
little
wisp
and
by
chance
or
by
fate
tam
had
been
enabled
to
gain
the
same
hold
spasmodically
he
set
his
fangs
in
a
viselike
tightening
of
his
grip
at
one
instant
the
black
was
whirling
and
writhing
in
the
fulness
of
his
wiry
might
at
the
next
with
a
sickening
snapping
sound
his
giant
body
went
limp
and
his
forequarters
hung
a
lifeless
weight
from
his
conqueror
s
jaws
tam
relaxed
his
hold
the
big
black
body
slumped
to
earth
and
lay
there
the
collie
panting
and
swaying
stood
over
his
dead
enemy
the
bitterly
long
quest
was
ended
heavenward
went
his
bleeding
muzzle
and
he
waked
the
solemn
stillnesses
of
the
summer
night
with
an
eerie
wolf
howl
the
awesome
primal
yell
of
victory
for
a
few
seconds
trask
frayne
unnoticed
stared
at
his
dog
and
as
he
looked
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
see
the
collie
change
gradually
back
from
a
wild
thing
of
the
forests
to
the
staunch
and
adoring
watchdog
of
other
days
then
the
man
spoke
tam
he
said
quietly
old
friend
the
exhausted
victor
lurched
dizzily
about
at
sound
of
the
voice
catching
sight
of
trask
he
trembled
all
over
he
took
a
dazed
step
towards
frayne
then
with
something
queerly
like
a
human
sob
the
collie
sprang
forward
and
gambolled
weakly
about
the
man
licking
trask
s
feet
and
hands
springing
up
in
a
groggy
effort
to
kiss
his
face
patting
his
master
s
chest
with
eager
forepaws
crying
aloud
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
at
the
reunion
then
all
at
once
he
seemed
to
remember
he
was
a
staid
and
dignified
dog
and
not
a
hoodlum
puppy
ceasing
his
demonstrations
he
stood
close
beside
frayne
looking
up
into
trask
s
eyes
in
silent
worship
you
ve
done
a
grand
night
s
work
tam
said
frayne
seeking
to
steady
his
own
voice
and
your
hurts
need
bathing
come
his
plumed
tail
proudly
wagging
his
splendid
head
aloft
turned
and
led
the
way
to
the
house
he
loved
the
sunnybank
collies
here
at
sunnybank
at
pompton
lakes
in
new
jersey
we
raise
thoroughbred
collies
for
many
years
we
have
been
breeding
them
for
many
years
longer
i
have
been
studying
them
the
more
i
study
them
the
more
i
realise
that
there
is
something
about
a
collie
a
mysterious
elusive
something
that
makes
him
different
from
any
other
dog
something
nearer
human
than
beast
and
for
all
that
he
is
one
hundred
per
cent
dog
there
is
much
to
learn
from
him
much
to
puzzle
over
as
perhaps
the
following
discursive
yarns
about
a
few
members
of
the
long
line
of
sunnybank
collies
may
show
greatest
of
them
all
was
lad
one
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
teaching
nursery
rhymes
to
emerson
as
of
teaching
lad
beyond
the
common
babyhood
lessons
of
obedience
and
of
the
place
s
simple
law
he
went
untaught
and
he
taught
himself
being
that
type
of
dog
for
example
the
mistress
had
been
dangerously
ill
with
pneumonia
in
my
book
a
i
tell
how
laddie
kept
vigil
outside
her
door
day
and
night
until
she
was
out
of
danger
and
how
he
celebrated
her
convalescence
with
a
brainstorm
which
would
have
disgraced
a
puppy
well
on
the
first
day
she
was
able
to
be
carried
out
of
doors
the
mistress
lay
in
a
veranda
hammock
with
lad
on
the
porch
floor
at
her
side
friends
several
instalments
of
them
drove
to
the
place
to
congratulate
the
mistress
on
her
recovery
and
to
bring
gifts
of
flowers
fruit
jellies
books
all
morning
lad
lay
there
watching
the
various
relays
of
guests
and
eyeing
the
presents
they
laid
in
her
lap
after
the
fifth
group
of
callers
had
gone
the
big
collie
got
up
and
trotted
off
into
the
forest
for
nearly
an
hour
he
was
absent
then
he
came
back
travelling
with
difficulty
by
reason
of
the
heavy
burden
he
bore
somewhere
far
away
in
the
woods
he
had
found
or
revisited
the
carcase
of
a
dead
horse
of
an
excessively
dead
horse
from
it
he
had
wrenched
two
ribs
and
some
of
the
vertebræ
dragging
this
horrible
gift
along
he
returned
to
the
veranda
before
any
of
us
were
well
aware
of
his
presence
the
wind
setting
in
the
other
direction
he
had
mounted
the
steps
and
with
one
mighty
heave
had
lifted
the
ribs
and
vertebræ
over
the
hammock
edge
and
laid
them
in
the
lap
of
his
dismayed
mistress
humans
had
celebrated
her
recovery
with
presents
and
he
watching
had
imitated
them
he
had
gone
far
and
had
toiled
hard
to
bring
her
an
offering
that
his
canine
mind
deemed
it
was
carrion
but
it
represented
to
a
dog
everything
that
a
present
should
be
dogs
do
not
eat
carrion
they
merely
rub
their
shoulders
in
it
on
the
same
principle
that
women
use
perfumes
it
is
a
purely
æsthetic
pleasure
to
them
and
carrion
is
probably
no
more
malodorous
to
a
human
being
than
is
the
reek
of
tobacco
or
of
whisky
or
even
of
some
scent
to
a
dog
it
is
all
a
matter
of
taste
and
of
education
noting
that
his
gift
awoke
no
joy
whatever
in
its
recipient
s
heart
lad
was
monstrous
crestfallen
nor
from
that
day
on
did
he
ever
bring
carrion
to
the
place
he
even
abstained
henceforth
from
rubbing
his
shoulders
in
it
evidently
he
gathered
from
our
reception
of
his
present
that
it
is
not
when
lad
was
training
his
little
son
wolf
to
become
a
decent
canine
citizen
he
was
much
annoyed
by
the
puppy
s
trick
of
watching
his
sire
bury
bones
and
then
of
exhuming
and
gnawing
them
himself
lad
did
not
punish
the
puppy
for
this
he
adopted
a
shrewder
and
surer
way
of
saving
his
buried
treasures
from
theft
thereafter
he
would
bury
the
choice
bone
deeper
in
the
ground
than
had
been
his
habit
and
directly
above
it
just
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
he
would
inter
a
second
and
older
bone
a
bone
that
had
long
been
denuded
of
all
meat
and
was
of
no
further
value
to
any
dog
wolf
galloping
eagerly
up
to
the
spot
of
burial
as
soon
as
lad
moved
away
would
dig
where
his
father
had
dug
presently
he
would
unearth
the
topmost
and
worthless
bone
satisfied
that
he
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
the
cache
he
dug
no
deeper
but
left
the
new
and
toothsome
bone
undiscovered
by
the
way
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
a
dog
is
almost
the
only
animal
to
bury
food
and
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
why
the
reason
is
simple
dogs
alone
of
all
wild
animals
dogs
and
their
the
wolves
used
to
hunt
in
packs
all
other
beasts
hunted
alone
or
at
most
in
pairs
when
prey
was
slain
the
dog
that
did
not
bolt
his
food
with
all
possible
haste
was
the
dog
that
got
the
smallest
share
or
none
at
all
when
there
was
more
food
than
could
be
devoured
at
one
meal
he
had
the
sense
to
lay
up
provision
for
the
next
day
s
dinner
he
knew
if
he
left
the
carcase
lying
where
it
was
it
would
be
devoured
by
the
rest
of
the
hungry
pack
so
he
buried
as
much
of
it
as
he
could
to
prevent
his
brethren
from
finding
and
eating
it
thus
the
dog
alone
of
all
quadrupeds
still
bolts
his
food
in
huge
and
mouthfuls
and
the
dog
buries
food
for
future
use
these
two
traits
are
as
purely
ancestral
as
is
the
dog
s
habit
of
turning
around
several
times
before
settling
himself
to
sleep
for
the
night
his
wild
ancestors
did
that
to
crush
the
stiff
grasses
and
reeds
into
a
softer
bed
and
to
scare
therefrom
any
lurking
snakes
or
scorpions
lad
s
talking
was
a
byword
at
sunnybank
only
to
the
mistress
and
myself
would
he
deign
to
but
to
us
he
would
sometimes
talk
for
five
minutes
at
a
time
of
course
there
were
no
actual
words
in
his
speech
but
no
words
were
needed
to
show
his
meaning
his
conversation
used
to
run
the
full
gamut
of
sounds
in
a
way
that
was
as
eerie
as
it
was
laughable
he
could
and
did
express
every
shade
of
meaning
he
chose
to
indignation
or
disgust
was
voiced
in
fierce
grumbles
and
mutters
that
were
run
together
in
sentence
lengths
sympathy
found
vent
in
queer
crooning
sounds
accompanied
by
swift
light
pats
of
his
absurdly
tiny
white
forepaws
grief
was
expressed
in
something
too
much
like
human
sobs
to
be
funny
and
so
on
through
every
possible
emotion
except
fear
the
great
dog
did
not
know
fear
no
one
listening
when
lad
talked
could
doubt
he
was
seeking
to
imitate
the
intonation
and
meanings
of
the
human
voice
once
the
mistress
and
i
went
on
a
visit
of
sympathy
to
a
lugubrious
old
woman
who
lived
some
miles
from
sunnybank
and
who
had
been
laid
up
for
weeks
with
a
broken
arm
the
arm
had
mended
but
it
was
still
a
source
of
mental
misery
to
the
victim
we
took
lad
along
on
our
call
because
the
convalescent
was
fond
of
him
we
had
every
cause
soon
to
wish
we
had
left
him
at
home
from
the
instant
we
entered
the
old
woman
s
house
a
demon
of
evil
mirth
seemed
to
possess
the
dog
outwardly
he
was
calm
and
sedate
as
usual
he
curled
up
beside
the
mistress
and
with
head
gravely
on
one
side
proceeded
to
listen
to
our
hostess
tale
of
the
long
and
painful
illness
but
scarcely
had
the
whiningly
groaning
accents
framed
a
single
sentence
of
the
recital
when
lad
took
up
the
woful
tale
on
his
own
account
his
voice
pitched
in
precisely
the
same
key
as
the
speaker
s
he
began
to
whine
and
to
mumble
when
the
woman
paused
for
breath
lad
filled
in
the
brief
interval
with
the
most
heartrendingly
lamentable
groans
then
continued
his
plaint
with
her
and
all
the
time
his
sorrowful
eyes
were
fairly
with
mischief
and
the
tip
of
his
plumy
tail
was
quivering
in
a
tense
effort
not
to
betray
his
sinful
glee
by
wagging
it
was
too
much
for
me
i
got
out
of
the
room
as
fast
as
i
could
i
escaped
barely
in
time
to
hear
the
hostess
moan
isn
t
it
wonderful
how
that
dog
understands
my
terrible
suffering
he
carries
on
just
as
if
it
were
his
own
agony
but
i
knew
better
in
spite
of
lad
s
affirmative
groan
in
personal
agony
lad
could
never
be
lured
into
making
a
sound
and
when
the
mistress
or
myself
was
unhappy
his
swift
and
sympathy
did
not
take
the
form
of
lamentable
ululations
or
of
such
impudent
copying
of
our
voices
it
was
just
one
of
lad
s
jokes
he
realised
as
well
as
we
did
that
the
old
lady
was
no
longer
in
pain
and
that
she
was
a
chronic
calamity
howler
that
was
his
way
of
guying
the
genuine
trouble
always
stirred
him
to
the
depths
but
his
life
long
he
hated
fraud
lad
s
story
is
told
in
detail
elsewhere
and
i
have
here
written
overlong
about
him
but
his
human
traits
were
myriad
and
it
is
hard
for
me
to
condense
an
account
of
him
then
there
was
bruce
hero
of
my
dogbook
of
the
same
name
bruce
s
pedigree
name
was
sunnybank
goldsmith
and
for
many
years
he
brought
local
fame
to
the
place
by
an
unbroken
succession
of
victories
a
score
of
cups
and
medals
and
an
armful
of
blue
ribbons
attest
his
physical
perfection
but
take
no
heed
of
a
collie
s
mentality
nor
of
the
thousand
wistfully
lovable
traits
which
make
him
what
he
is
when
we
carved
on
bruce
s
headstone
the
inscription
dog
without
a
we
referred
less
to
his
physical
magnificence
than
to
the
soul
and
the
heart
of
him
he
was
wholly
different
from
lad
he
lacked
lad
s
d
dash
and
gaiety
and
uncanny
wisdom
yet
he
was
clever
and
he
had
a
strange
sweetness
of
nature
that
i
have
found
in
no
other
dog
that
and
a
perfect
obedience
and
goodness
like
lad
he
was
never
struck
or
otherwise
punished
and
never
needed
such
punishment
he
and
laddie
were
dear
friends
from
the
moment
they
met
and
each
was
the
only
grown
male
dog
with
which
the
other
would
consent
to
be
on
terms
of
cordiality
bruce
had
a
melancholy
dignity
behind
which
lurked
an
elusive
sense
of
fun
for
his
children
he
had
many
dozens
of
them
he
felt
an
eternal
disgust
even
aversion
let
visitors
start
to
walk
towards
the
and
bruce
at
once
lowered
his
head
and
tail
and
slunk
away
when
a
group
of
the
puppies
out
for
a
gallop
caught
sight
of
their
sire
and
bore
down
gleefully
upon
him
bruce
would
stalk
off
in
utter
gloom
too
chivalric
to
hurt
or
even
to
growl
at
any
of
the
scrambling
oncoming
babies
he
would
none
the
less
take
himself
out
of
their
way
with
all
possible
haste
but
on
occasion
he
could
rise
to
a
sense
of
his
duties
as
a
parent
as
when
one
of
the
young
dogs
was
left
tied
for
a
few
minutes
to
a
clothesline
three
summers
ago
the
youngster
gnawed
the
line
in
two
and
pranced
merrily
away
on
a
rabbit
hunt
dragging
ten
feet
of
rope
with
him
when
i
came
home
and
saw
the
severed
clothesline
i
knew
what
must
be
happening
somewhere
out
in
the
woods
the
dangling
rope
was
certain
to
catch
in
some
bush
or
stump
and
the
puppy
in
his
struggles
would
snarl
himself
inextricably
there
unless
help
should
come
he
must
starve
to
death
for
hours
two
of
the
men
and
the
mistress
and
myself
scoured
the
forests
and
hills
for
a
radius
of
several
miles
we
looked
everywhere
a
luckless
puppy
would
be
likely
to
entangle
himself
we
shouted
ourselves
hoarse
in
hope
of
an
answering
cry
from
the
lost
one
after
a
day
and
a
night
of
this
fruitless
search
the
mistress
and
i
set
off
again
this
time
taking
bruce
along
at
least
we
started
off
taking
him
after
the
first
hundred
yards
he
took
us
why
i
bothered
to
follow
him
i
don
t
yet
know
he
struck
a
bee
line
through
woods
and
brambles
travelling
at
a
hard
gallop
and
stopping
every
few
moments
for
me
to
catch
up
with
him
at
the
end
of
a
mile
he
plunged
into
a
copse
that
was
choked
with
briars
in
the
centre
of
this
he
gave
tongue
with
a
salvo
of
thunderous
barks
twice
before
i
had
searched
this
copse
but
at
his
urgency
i
entered
it
again
in
its
exact
centre
hidden
from
view
by
a
matted
screen
of
briars
and
leaves
i
found
the
runaway
his
rope
had
caught
in
a
root
he
had
then
wound
himself
up
in
it
until
the
line
enmeshed
him
and
held
him
close
to
earth
a
twist
of
it
around
his
jaws
had
kept
him
from
making
a
sound
he
was
half
dead
from
fright
and
thirst
having
found
and
saved
the
younger
dog
bruce
promptly
lost
all
interest
in
him
he
seemed
ashamed
rather
than
pleased
at
our
laudations
on
such
few
times
as
we
went
motoring
without
him
bruce
was
always
on
hand
to
greet
us
on
our
return
and
his
greeting
took
an
odd
form
near
the
foot
of
the
drive
was
a
big
forsythia
bush
at
sight
of
the
approaching
car
bruce
invariably
rushed
over
to
this
bush
and
hid
behind
it
at
least
he
bent
his
head
until
a
branch
of
the
bush
hid
it
from
view
then
tail
he
would
crouch
there
not
realising
that
all
of
him
except
his
head
was
in
plain
sight
to
us
when
at
last
the
car
was
almost
alongside
he
would
jump
out
and
stand
wagging
his
plumed
tail
excitedly
to
note
our
surprise
at
his
unforeseen
presence
never
did
this
jest
pall
on
him
never
did
he
have
the
faintest
idea
that
his
head
was
the
only
part
of
his
beautiful
self
which
was
not
clearly
visible
bruce
slept
in
my
bedroom
in
the
morning
when
one
of
the
maids
knocked
at
the
door
to
wake
me
he
would
get
to
his
feet
cross
the
room
to
the
bed
and
lay
his
cold
muzzle
against
my
face
tapping
at
my
arm
or
shoulder
with
his
paw
until
i
opened
my
eyes
then
at
once
he
went
back
to
his
rug
and
lay
down
again
nor
if
i
failed
to
climb
out
of
bed
for
another
two
hours
would
he
disturb
me
a
second
time
he
had
waked
me
once
after
that
it
was
up
to
me
to
obey
the
summons
or
to
disregard
it
that
was
no
concern
of
bruce
s
his
duty
was
done
but
how
did
a
mere
dog
know
that
the
knock
on
the
door
was
a
signal
for
me
to
get
up
never
by
any
chance
did
he
disturb
me
until
he
heard
that
knock
he
was
psychic
too
rex
a
dog
that
i
had
had
long
before
used
to
sleep
in
a
certain
corner
of
the
lower
hall
he
slept
there
for
years
he
was
killed
never
afterward
would
bruce
set
foot
on
the
spot
where
rex
had
been
wont
to
lie
time
and
again
i
have
seen
him
skirt
that
part
of
the
floor
making
a
detour
in
order
to
avoid
stepping
there
i
have
tested
him
a
dozen
times
in
the
presence
of
guests
always
the
result
was
the
same
peace
to
his
stately
lovable
whimsical
soul
he
was
my
dear
chum
and
his
going
has
left
an
ache
wolf
is
lad
s
son
wiry
and
undersized
yet
he
is
as
golden
as
katherine
lee
bates
immortal
he
inherits
his
sire
s
wonderful
brain
as
well
as
laddie
s
keen
sense
of
humour
savage
and
hating
strangers
wolf
has
learned
the
law
to
this
extent
no
one
walking
or
motoring
down
the
drive
from
the
gate
and
coming
straight
to
the
front
door
must
be
molested
though
no
stranger
crossing
the
grounds
or
prowling
within
their
limits
need
be
tolerated
a
guest
may
pat
him
on
the
head
at
will
and
wolf
must
make
no
sign
of
resentment
but
all
my
years
of
training
do
not
prevent
him
from
snarling
in
fierce
menace
if
a
visitor
seeks
to
pat
his
sensitive
body
very
young
children
are
the
only
exceptions
to
this
rule
of
his
toddling
babies
may
maul
him
to
their
hearts
content
and
wolf
revels
in
the
discomfort
like
lad
he
is
the
mistress
dog
not
merely
because
he
belongs
to
her
but
because
he
has
adopted
her
for
his
deity
when
we
leave
sunnybank
for
two
or
three
months
yearly
in
midwinter
wolf
knows
we
are
going
even
before
the
trunks
are
brought
from
the
attic
for
packing
and
from
that
time
on
he
is
in
dire
silent
misery
when
at
last
the
car
carries
us
out
of
the
gate
he
sits
down
points
his
muzzle
skyward
and
shakes
the
air
with
a
series
of
raucous
after
five
minutes
of
which
he
sullenly
stoically
takes
up
the
burden
of
loneliness
until
our
return
the
queer
part
of
it
is
that
he
knows
as
lad
and
bruce
used
to
know
in
some
occult
way
when
we
are
coming
home
and
for
hours
before
our
return
he
is
in
a
state
of
crazy
excitement
i
don
t
try
to
explain
this
i
have
no
explanation
for
it
but
it
can
be
proven
by
anyone
at
sunnybank
the
ancestral
herding
instinct
is
strong
in
wolf
it
made
itself
known
first
when
a
car
was
coming
down
the
drive
towards
the
house
at
a
somewhat
reckless
pace
several
years
ago
in
the
centre
of
the
drive
several
of
the
collie
pups
were
playing
when
the
car
was
almost
on
top
of
the
heedless
bevy
of
youngsters
wolf
darted
out
from
the
veranda
rushed
in
among
the
pups
and
shouldered
them
off
the
drive
and
up
onto
the
bank
at
either
side
he
cleared
the
drive
of
every
one
of
them
then
bounded
aside
barely
in
time
to
escape
the
car
s
front
wheels
he
was
praised
for
this
bit
of
quick
thought
and
quicker
action
and
the
praise
made
him
inordinately
proud
from
that
day
on
he
has
hustled
every
pup
or
grown
dog
off
the
drive
whenever
a
car
has
come
in
sight
through
the
gateway
when
the
pups
are
too
far
scattered
for
him
to
round
them
up
and
shove
them
out
of
harm
s
way
in
so
short
a
time
he
adopts
a
still
better
mode
of
clearing
the
drive
barking
in
wild
ecstasy
he
rushes
at
top
speed
down
the
lawn
as
though
in
pursuit
of
some
highly
alluring
prey
no
living
pup
can
resist
such
a
call
every
one
of
the
youngsters
dashes
in
pursuit
then
as
soon
as
the
last
of
them
is
far
enough
away
from
the
drive
wolf
stops
and
comes
trotting
back
to
the
house
he
has
done
this
again
and
again
to
me
it
savours
of
human
reasoning
in
the
car
wolf
is
as
efficient
a
guard
as
any
policeman
when
the
mistress
drives
alone
he
sits
on
the
front
seat
beside
her
if
she
stops
in
front
of
any
shop
he
is
at
once
on
the
alert
at
such
times
a
woman
acquaintance
may
come
alongside
for
a
word
with
her
wolf
pays
no
heed
to
the
newcomer
but
let
a
approach
the
car
and
wolf
is
up
on
his
toes
and
ready
for
trouble
if
the
man
lays
a
hand
on
the
automobile
in
the
course
of
the
chat
wolf
is
at
his
throat
when
i
am
driving
with
the
mistress
he
lies
on
the
rear
seat
and
does
not
bother
to
act
as
policeman
except
when
we
leave
the
car
in
his
keeping
people
hereabouts
know
this
trait
of
wolf
s
and
his
aversion
to
any
stranger
and
they
forbear
to
touch
the
car
when
talking
with
us
last
year
a
friend
came
alongside
while
we
were
waiting
one
evening
for
the
mail
to
be
sorted
wolf
had
never
before
seen
this
man
yet
after
a
single
glance
the
dog
lost
his
usual
air
of
hostility
there
was
a
slight
tremble
in
our
friend
s
voice
as
he
said
to
us
my
collie
was
run
over
and
killed
we
are
mighty
unhappy
at
our
house
this
as
he
spoke
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
door
of
the
car
wolf
lurched
forward
as
usual
but
to
our
amazement
instead
of
attacking
he
whimpered
softly
and
licked
the
man
s
face
never
before
or
since
have
i
seen
him
show
any
sign
of
friendly
interest
in
a
stranger
not
even
to
this
same
man
when
they
chanced
to
meet
again
a
few
months
later
bruce
s
son
jock
was
the
finest
pup
from
a
point
of
view
and
in
every
other
way
that
we
have
been
able
to
breed
jock
was
physical
perfection
and
he
had
a
brain
too
and
abundant
charm
and
a
most
intensely
haunting
personality
he
had
from
earliest
puppyhood
all
the
steadfast
qualities
of
a
veteran
dog
and
at
the
same
time
a
babylike
friendliness
and
love
of
play
nor
did
he
know
what
it
was
to
be
afraid
always
in
presence
of
danger
he
met
the
menace
with
a
furious
charge
accompanied
by
a
clear
of
gay
defiance
once
for
instance
he
had
been
lying
beside
my
chair
on
the
veranda
suddenly
he
jumped
to
his
feet
with
that
same
gay
fierce
bark
i
turned
to
see
what
had
excited
him
a
huge
copperhead
snake
had
crawled
up
the
vines
to
the
porch
floor
and
had
wriggled
on
to
within
a
foot
or
two
of
my
chair
jock
was
barely
six
months
old
yet
he
flew
to
the
assault
with
more
sense
than
would
many
a
grown
dog
all
dogs
have
a
horror
of
copperheads
and
jock
was
no
exception
by
instinct
he
seemed
to
know
what
the
snake
s
tactics
would
be
for
he
strove
to
catch
the
foe
by
the
back
of
the
neck
before
the
copperhead
could
coil
he
was
a
fraction
of
a
second
too
late
yet
he
was
nimble
and
wise
enough
to
spring
back
out
of
reach
before
the
coiling
serpent
could
strike
then
with
that
same
glad
bark
of
defiance
he
danced
about
his
enemy
trying
to
take
the
snake
from
the
rear
and
to
flash
in
and
get
a
neck
grip
before
the
copperhead
could
recoil
after
each
futile
strike
i
put
an
end
to
the
battle
by
a
bullet
in
the
snake
s
ugly
head
and
jock
was
mortally
offended
with
me
for
hours
thereafter
for
spoiling
his
fun
when
he
was
eight
months
old
i
took
the
little
chap
to
paterson
to
his
first
and
last
dog
show
never
before
had
he
been
off
the
place
or
in
a
house
yet
he
bore
himself
like
a
seasoned
traveller
and
he
showed
with
the
perfection
of
a
champion
he
won
in
class
after
class
annexing
two
silver
cups
and
several
blue
ribbons
his
peerless
sire
bruce
was
the
only
collie
in
the
whole
show
able
to
win
over
him
that
day
jock
beat
every
other
contestant
he
seemed
to
enjoy
showing
and
to
delight
in
the
novelty
and
excitement
of
it
all
he
was
at
the
show
for
only
a
few
hours
and
it
was
a
for
him
yet
cheerfully
would
i
give
a
thousand
dollars
not
to
have
taken
him
there
for
he
brought
home
not
only
his
many
prizes
but
a
virulent
case
of
distemper
as
did
other
dogs
that
attended
the
same
show
of
course
i
had
had
him
as
well
as
all
my
other
dogs
inoculated
against
distemper
long
before
and
such
precautions
are
supposed
to
be
effective
but
the
disease
got
through
the
inoculation
and
infected
him
he
made
a
gallant
fight
of
it
oh
a
fight
the
fearless
little
thoroughbred
but
it
was
too
much
for
him
for
five
weeks
he
and
i
fought
that
grindingly
losing
battle
then
in
the
dim
grey
of
a
november
dawn
he
lifted
his
head
from
my
knee
and
peered
through
the
shadows
towards
one
black
corner
of
the
room
no
one
watching
him
could
have
doubted
that
he
saw
something
lurking
there
in
the
dark
sharply
he
eyed
the
dim
for
an
instant
then
from
his
throat
burst
forth
that
glad
fierce
of
his
his
fearlessly
gay
battle
shout
and
he
fell
back
dead
what
did
he
see
waiting
for
him
there
in
the
murk
of
shadows
perhaps
nothing
perhaps
the
in
visible
who
knows
in
any
case
whatever
it
was
he
did
not
fear
it
he
challenged
it
as
fiercely
as
ever
he
had
challenged
mortal
foe
and
his
went
forth
to
do
battle
with
it
unafraid
god
grant
us
all
so
gallant
an
ending
his
little
mother
sunnybank
jean
had
never
cast
jock
off
as
do
most
when
their
pups
are
weaned
to
the
day
i
quarantined
him
for
distemper
she
and
her
son
had
been
inseparable
a
week
after
jock
s
death
jean
came
running
up
to
me
shaking
with
glad
eagerness
and
led
me
to
the
grave
where
the
puppy
had
been
buried
it
was
far
off
and
i
had
hoped
she
would
not
be
able
to
find
it
but
she
had
been
searching
very
patiently
whenever
she
was
free
and
now
when
she
had
led
me
to
the
grave
she
lay
down
close
beside
it
not
despondently
but
wagging
her
plumed
tail
gently
and
as
if
she
had
found
at
last
a
clue
in
her
long
search
scent
or
some
other
sense
told
her
she
was
nearer
her
baby
than
she
had
been
in
days
and
she
was
well
content
to
wait
there
until
he
should
come
back
all
of
which
is
maudlin
perhaps
but
it
is
true
perhaps
it
is
also
maudlin
to
wonder
why
a
sane
human
should
be
fool
enough
to
let
himself
care
for
a
dog
when
he
knows
that
at
best
he
is
due
for
a
man
s
size
heartache
within
a
pitifully
brief
span
of
years
dogs
live
so
short
a
time
and
we
humans
so
long
this
rambling
tale
of
my
dogs
leaves
no
room
to
tell
at
length
of
the
collie
who
was
never
allowed
in
the
until
the
coffee
was
served
and
who
came
the
length
of
the
hall
and
up
to
the
table
the
moment
the
maid
brought
in
the
coffee
cups
how
he
timed
it
to
the
very
second
none
of
us
knew
yet
not
once
did
he
miss
connections
by
the
slightest
fraction
of
a
minute
nor
does
it
permit
the
tale
of
the
collie
pup
who
was
proud
of
his
stunt
in
learning
to
take
the
morning
paper
off
the
front
steps
and
carry
it
into
the
and
whose
pride
in
the
accomplishment
led
him
presently
to
collect
all
the
morning
papers
from
all
the
door
steps
within
the
radius
of
a
mile
and
deposit
them
happily
at
my
feet
nor
can
i
tell
of
the
collie
that
caught
and
followed
the
trail
of
my
footsteps
through
the
rain
along
a
crowded
city
street
in
and
out
of
a
maze
of
turnings
and
came
up
with
me
inside
of
three
minutes
nor
of
a
long
line
of
other
collies
some
of
whom
showed
human
intelligence
and
some
intelligence
that
was
almost
more
than
human
not
even
of
the
clown
pup
that
was
so
elated
over
rounding
up
his
first
bunch
of
sheep
that
he
proceeded
to
round
up
chickens
and
cats
and
every
living
and
creature
that
he
could
find
nor
of
the
collie
who
taught
to
fetch
my
hat
was
wont
to
romp
up
to
me
in
the
presence
of
many
outsiders
bearing
proudly
in
his
teeth
an
assortment
of
humble
not
to
say
intimate
and
humiliating
garments
comedian
dogs
spectacular
dogs
gloriously
human
dogs
sunnybank
collies
of
every
phase
of
heart
and
brain
and
soul
one
common
and
pathetically
early
tragedy
has
waited
or
waits
for
you
all
among
you
you
have
taught
me
more
of
true
loyalty
and
patience
and
courtesy
and
divine
forgiveness
and
solid
sanity
and
fun
and
a
hundred
other
lessons
than
all
the
masters
i
have
studied
under
i
wonder
if
it
is
heretical
to
believe
that
when
at
last
my
tired
feet
shall
tread
the
other
shore
a
madly
welcoming
swirl
of
exultant
collies
the
splendid
sunnybank
dogs
that
have
been
my
chums
here
will
bound
forward
circling
and
barking
around
me
to
lead
me
home
heretical
or
otherwise
i
want
to
believe
it
and
if
i
fail
to
find
them
there
i
shall
know
i
have
taken
the
wrong
turning
and
have
reached
a
goal
other
than
i
hoped
for
the
end
