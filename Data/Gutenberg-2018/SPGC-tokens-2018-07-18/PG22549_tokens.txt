the
had
been
plunging
through
hyperspace
with
her
eight
thousand
colonists
fleeing
like
a
hunted
thing
with
her
communicators
silenced
and
her
drives
moaning
and
thundering
up
in
the
control
room
irene
had
been
told
the
needles
of
the
dials
danced
against
the
red
danger
lines
day
and
night
she
lay
in
bed
and
listened
to
the
muffled
ceaseless
roar
of
the
drives
and
felt
the
singing
vibration
of
the
hull
should
be
almost
safe
by
she
thought
is
only
forty
days
thinking
of
the
new
life
awaiting
them
all
made
her
too
restless
to
lie
still
any
longer
she
got
up
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
switch
on
the
light
dale
was
gone
he
had
been
summoned
to
adjust
one
of
the
machines
in
the
ship
room
and
billy
was
asleep
nothing
showing
of
him
above
the
covers
but
a
crop
of
brown
hair
and
the
furry
nose
of
his
ragged
teddy
bear
she
reached
out
to
straighten
the
covers
gently
so
as
not
to
awaken
him
it
happened
then
the
thing
they
had
all
feared
from
the
stern
of
the
ship
came
a
jarring
deafening
explosion
the
ship
lurched
violently
girders
screamed
and
the
light
flicked
out
in
the
darkness
she
heard
a
as
the
automatic
guard
system
slid
doors
shut
against
sections
of
the
ship
suddenly
airless
the
doors
were
still
thudding
shut
when
another
explosion
came
from
toward
the
bow
then
there
was
silence
a
feeling
of
utter
quiet
and
motionlessness
the
fingers
of
fear
enclosed
her
and
her
mind
said
to
her
like
the
cold
unpassionate
voice
of
a
stranger
gerns
have
found
the
light
came
on
again
a
feeble
glow
and
there
was
the
soft
muffled
sound
of
questioning
voices
in
the
other
compartments
she
dressed
her
fingers
shaking
and
clumsy
wishing
that
dale
would
come
to
reassure
her
to
tell
her
that
nothing
really
serious
had
happened
that
it
had
not
been
the
gerns
it
was
very
still
in
the
little
compartment
strangely
so
she
had
finished
dressing
when
she
realized
the
reason
the
air
circulation
system
had
stopped
working
that
meant
the
power
failure
was
so
great
that
the
air
regenerators
themselves
were
dead
and
there
were
eight
thousand
people
on
the
who
would
have
to
have
air
to
live
the
buzzer
sounded
shrilly
from
the
public
address
system
speakers
that
were
scattered
down
the
ship
corridors
a
voice
she
recognized
as
that
of
lieutenant
commander
lake
spoke
war
was
declared
upon
earth
by
the
gern
empire
ten
days
ago
two
gern
cruisers
have
attacked
us
and
their
blasters
have
destroyed
the
stern
and
bow
of
the
ship
we
are
without
a
drive
and
without
power
but
for
a
few
emergency
batteries
i
am
the
only
surviving
officer
and
the
gern
commander
is
boarding
us
to
give
me
the
surrender
terms
none
of
you
will
leave
your
compartments
until
ordered
to
do
so
wherever
you
may
be
remain
there
this
is
necessary
to
avoid
confusion
and
to
have
as
many
as
possible
in
known
locations
for
future
instructions
i
repeat
you
will
not
leave
your
compartments
the
speaker
cut
off
she
stood
without
moving
and
heard
again
the
words
am
the
only
surviving
officer
the
gerns
had
killed
her
father
he
had
been
of
the
dunbar
expedition
that
had
discovered
the
world
of
athena
and
his
knowledge
of
athena
was
valuable
to
the
colonization
plans
he
had
been
quartered
among
the
officers
and
the
gern
blast
had
destroyed
that
section
of
the
ship
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
again
and
tried
to
reorient
herself
to
accept
the
fact
that
her
life
and
the
lives
of
all
the
others
had
abruptly
irrevocably
been
changed
the
athena
colonization
plan
was
ended
they
had
known
such
a
thing
might
happen
that
was
why
the
had
been
made
ready
for
the
voyage
in
secret
and
had
waited
for
months
for
the
chance
to
slip
through
the
ring
of
gern
spy
ships
that
was
why
she
had
raced
at
full
speed
with
her
communicators
silenced
so
there
would
be
no
radiations
for
the
gerns
to
find
her
by
only
forty
days
more
would
have
brought
them
to
the
green
and
virgin
world
of
athena
four
hundred
beyond
the
outermost
boundary
of
the
gern
empire
there
they
should
have
been
safe
from
gern
detection
for
many
years
to
come
for
long
enough
to
build
planetary
defenses
against
attack
and
there
they
would
have
used
athena
rich
resources
to
make
ships
and
weapons
to
defend
earth
against
the
inexorably
increasing
inclosure
of
the
mighty
coldly
calculating
colossus
that
was
the
gern
empire
success
or
failure
of
the
athena
plan
had
meant
ultimate
life
or
death
for
earth
they
had
taken
every
precaution
possible
but
the
gern
spy
system
had
somehow
learned
of
athena
and
the
now
the
cold
war
was
no
longer
cold
and
the
plan
was
dust
billy
sighed
and
stirred
in
the
sleep
that
had
not
been
broken
by
the
blasts
that
had
altered
the
lives
of
eight
thousand
people
and
the
fate
of
a
world
she
shook
his
shoulder
and
said
billy
he
raised
up
so
small
and
young
to
her
eyes
that
the
question
in
her
mind
was
like
an
anguished
prayer
god
what
do
gerns
do
to
boys
he
saw
her
face
and
the
dim
light
and
the
sleepiness
was
suddenly
gone
from
him
what
wrong
mama
and
why
are
you
scared
there
was
no
reason
to
lie
to
him
the
gerns
found
us
and
stopped
us
oh
he
said
in
his
manner
was
the
grave
thoughtfulness
of
a
boy
twice
his
age
as
there
always
was
will
they
will
they
kill
us
get
dressed
honey
she
said
hurry
so
we
be
ready
when
they
let
daddy
come
back
to
tell
us
what
to
do
they
were
both
ready
when
the
buzzer
sounded
again
in
the
corridors
lake
spoke
his
tone
grim
and
bitter
there
is
no
power
for
the
air
regenerators
and
within
twenty
hours
we
will
start
smothering
to
death
under
these
circumstances
i
could
not
do
other
than
accept
the
survival
terms
the
gern
commander
offered
us
he
will
speak
to
you
now
and
you
will
obey
his
orders
without
protest
death
is
the
only
alternative
then
the
voice
of
the
gern
commander
came
quick
and
harsh
and
brittle
this
section
of
space
together
with
planet
athena
is
an
extension
of
the
gern
empire
this
ship
has
deliberately
invaded
gern
territory
in
time
of
war
with
intent
to
seize
and
exploit
a
gern
world
we
are
willing
however
to
offer
a
leniency
not
required
by
the
circumstances
terran
technicians
and
skilled
workers
in
certain
fields
can
be
used
in
the
factories
we
shall
build
on
athena
the
others
will
not
be
needed
and
there
is
not
room
on
the
cruisers
to
take
them
your
occupation
records
will
be
used
to
divide
you
into
two
groups
the
acceptables
and
the
rejects
the
rejects
will
be
taken
by
the
cruisers
to
an
planet
near
here
and
left
together
with
the
personal
possessions
in
their
compartments
and
additional
and
ample
supplies
the
acceptables
will
then
be
taken
on
to
athena
and
at
a
later
date
the
cruisers
will
return
the
rejects
to
earth
this
division
will
split
families
but
there
will
be
no
resistance
to
it
gern
guards
will
be
sent
immediately
to
make
this
division
and
you
will
wait
in
your
compartments
for
them
you
will
obey
their
orders
promptly
and
without
annoying
them
with
questions
at
the
first
instance
of
resistance
or
rebellion
this
offer
will
be
withdrawn
and
the
cruisers
will
go
their
way
again
in
the
silence
following
the
ultimatum
she
could
hear
the
soft
wordless
murmur
from
the
other
compartments
the
undertone
of
anxiety
like
a
dark
thread
through
it
in
every
compartment
parents
and
children
brothers
and
sisters
were
seeing
one
another
for
the
last
time
the
corridor
outside
rang
to
the
tramp
of
feet
the
sound
of
a
dozen
gerns
walking
with
swift
military
precision
she
held
her
breath
her
heart
racing
but
they
went
past
her
door
and
on
to
the
corridor
end
there
she
could
faintly
hear
them
entering
compartments
demanding
names
and
saying
out
out
once
she
heard
a
gern
say
acceptables
will
remain
inside
until
further
notice
do
not
open
your
doors
after
the
rejects
have
been
taken
out
billy
touched
her
on
the
hand
is
daddy
going
to
come
he
he
ca
right
now
we
see
him
pretty
soon
she
remembered
what
the
gern
commander
had
said
about
the
rejects
being
permitted
to
take
their
personal
possessions
she
had
very
little
time
in
which
to
get
together
what
she
could
carry
there
were
two
small
bags
in
the
compartment
and
she
hurried
to
pack
them
with
things
she
and
dale
and
billy
might
need
not
able
to
know
which
of
them
if
any
would
be
rejects
nor
could
she
know
whether
she
should
put
in
clothes
for
a
cold
world
or
a
hot
one
the
gern
commander
had
said
the
rejects
would
be
left
on
an
planet
but
where
could
it
be
the
dunbar
expedition
had
explored
across
five
hundred
of
space
and
had
found
only
one
world
athena
the
gerns
were
almost
to
her
door
when
she
had
finished
and
she
heard
them
enter
the
compartments
across
from
her
own
there
came
the
hard
curt
questions
and
the
command
outside
hurry
a
woman
said
something
in
pleading
question
and
there
was
the
soft
thud
of
a
blow
and
the
words
outside
do
not
ask
questions
a
moment
later
she
heard
the
woman
going
down
the
corridor
trying
to
hold
back
her
crying
then
the
gerns
were
at
her
own
door
she
held
billy
hand
and
waited
for
them
with
her
heart
hammering
she
held
her
head
high
and
composed
herself
with
all
the
determination
she
could
muster
so
that
the
arrogant
gerns
would
not
see
that
she
was
afraid
billy
stood
beside
her
as
tall
as
his
five
years
would
permit
his
teddy
bear
under
his
arm
and
only
the
way
his
hand
held
to
hers
showed
that
he
too
was
scared
the
door
was
flung
open
and
two
gerns
strode
in
the
were
big
dark
men
with
powerful
bulging
muscles
they
surveyed
her
and
the
room
with
a
quick
sweep
of
eyes
that
were
like
glittering
obsidian
their
mouths
thin
cruel
slashes
in
the
flat
brutal
planes
of
their
faces
your
name
snapped
the
one
who
carried
a
sheaf
of
occupation
records
it
she
tried
to
swallow
the
quaver
in
her
voice
and
make
it
cool
and
unfrightened
irene
lois
humbolt
dale
humbolt
the
gern
glanced
at
the
papers
where
is
your
husband
he
was
in
the
room
at
you
are
a
reject
out
down
the
corridor
with
the
others
my
husband
will
he
be
a
outside
it
was
the
tone
of
voice
that
had
preceded
the
blow
in
the
other
compartment
and
the
gern
took
a
quick
step
toward
her
she
seized
the
two
bags
in
one
hand
not
wanting
to
release
billy
and
swung
back
to
hurry
out
into
the
corridor
the
other
gern
jerked
one
of
the
bags
from
her
hand
and
flung
it
to
the
floor
only
one
bag
per
person
he
said
and
gave
her
an
impatient
shove
that
sent
her
and
billy
stumbling
through
the
doorway
she
became
part
of
the
rejects
who
were
being
herded
like
sheep
down
the
corridors
and
into
the
port
airlock
there
were
many
children
among
them
the
young
ones
frightened
and
crying
and
often
with
only
one
parent
or
an
older
brother
or
sister
to
take
care
of
them
and
there
were
many
young
ones
who
had
no
one
at
all
and
were
dependent
upon
strangers
to
take
their
hands
and
tell
them
what
they
must
do
when
she
was
passing
the
corridor
that
led
to
the
room
she
saw
a
group
of
rejects
being
herded
up
it
dale
was
not
among
them
and
she
knew
then
that
she
and
billy
would
never
see
him
again
out
from
the
ship
faster
faster
the
commands
of
the
gern
guards
snapped
like
whips
around
them
as
she
and
the
other
rejects
crowded
and
stumbled
down
the
boarding
ramp
and
out
onto
the
rocky
ground
there
was
the
pull
of
a
terrible
gravity
such
as
she
had
never
experienced
and
they
were
in
a
bleak
barren
valley
a
cold
wind
moaning
down
it
and
whipping
the
alkali
dust
in
bitter
clouds
around
the
valley
stood
ragged
hills
their
white
tops
laying
out
streamers
of
snow
and
the
sky
was
dark
with
sunset
out
from
the
ship
faster
it
was
hard
to
walk
fast
in
the
high
gravity
carrying
the
bag
in
one
hand
and
holding
up
all
of
billy
weight
she
could
with
the
other
they
lied
to
us
a
man
beside
her
said
to
someone
let
turn
and
fight
let
take
a
gern
blaster
cracked
with
a
vivid
blue
flash
and
the
man
plunged
lifelessly
to
the
ground
she
flinched
instinctively
and
fell
over
an
unseen
rock
the
bag
of
precious
clothes
flying
from
her
hand
she
scrambled
up
again
her
left
knee
half
numb
and
turned
to
retrieve
it
the
gern
guard
was
already
upon
her
his
blaster
still
in
his
hand
out
from
the
ship
faster
the
barrel
of
his
blaster
lashed
across
the
side
of
her
head
move
on
move
on
she
staggered
in
a
blinding
blaze
of
pain
and
then
hurried
on
holding
tight
to
billy
hand
the
wind
cutting
like
knives
of
ice
through
her
thin
clothes
and
blood
running
in
a
trickle
down
her
cheek
he
hit
you
billy
said
he
hurt
you
then
he
called
the
gern
a
name
that
boys
were
not
supposed
to
know
with
a
savagery
that
boys
were
not
supposed
to
possess
when
she
stopped
at
the
outer
fringe
of
rejects
she
saw
that
all
of
them
were
out
of
the
cruiser
and
the
guards
were
going
back
into
it
a
half
mile
down
the
valley
the
other
cruiser
stood
the
rejects
out
from
it
and
its
boarding
ramps
already
withdrawn
when
she
had
buttoned
billy
blouse
tighter
and
wiped
the
blood
from
her
face
the
first
blast
of
the
drives
came
from
the
farther
cruiser
the
nearer
one
blasted
a
moment
later
and
they
lifted
together
their
roaring
filling
the
valley
they
climbed
faster
and
faster
dwindling
as
they
went
then
they
disappeared
in
the
black
sky
their
roaring
faded
away
and
there
was
left
only
the
moaning
of
the
wind
around
her
and
somewhere
a
child
crying
and
somewhere
a
voice
asking
where
are
we
in
the
name
of
god
what
have
they
done
to
us
she
looked
at
the
snow
streaming
from
the
ragged
hills
felt
the
hard
pull
of
the
gravity
and
knew
where
they
were
they
were
on
ragnarok
the
of
gravity
and
fierce
beasts
and
raging
fevers
where
men
could
not
survive
the
name
came
from
an
old
teutonic
myth
and
meant
last
day
for
gods
and
the
dunbar
expedition
had
discovered
ragnarok
and
her
father
had
told
her
of
it
of
how
it
had
killed
six
of
the
eight
men
who
had
left
the
ship
and
would
have
killed
all
of
them
if
they
had
remained
any
longer
she
knew
where
they
were
and
she
knew
the
gerns
had
lied
to
them
and
would
never
send
a
ship
to
take
them
to
earth
their
abandonment
there
had
been
intended
as
a
death
sentence
for
all
of
them
and
dale
was
gone
and
she
and
billy
would
die
helpless
and
alone
it
will
be
dark
so
soon
billy
voice
shook
with
the
cold
if
daddy
ca
find
us
in
the
dark
what
will
we
do
i
do
know
she
said
there
no
one
to
help
us
and
how
can
i
know
what
we
should
do
she
was
from
the
city
how
could
she
know
what
to
do
on
an
alien
hostile
world
where
armed
explorers
had
died
she
had
tried
to
be
brave
before
the
gerns
but
now
now
night
was
at
hand
and
out
of
it
would
come
terror
and
death
for
herself
and
billy
they
would
never
see
dale
again
never
see
athena
or
earth
or
even
the
dawn
on
the
world
that
had
killed
them
she
tried
not
to
cry
and
failed
billy
cold
little
hand
touched
her
own
trying
to
reassure
her
do
cry
mama
i
guess
i
guess
everybody
else
is
scared
too
else
she
was
not
alone
how
could
she
have
thought
she
was
alone
all
around
her
were
others
as
helpless
and
uncertain
as
she
her
story
was
only
one
out
of
four
thousand
i
guess
they
are
billy
she
said
i
never
thought
of
that
before
she
knelt
to
put
her
arms
around
him
thinking
and
fear
are
futile
weapons
they
can
never
bring
us
any
tomorrows
we
have
to
fight
whatever
comes
to
kill
us
no
matter
how
scared
we
are
for
ourselves
and
for
our
children
above
all
else
for
our
children
i
going
back
to
find
our
clothes
she
said
you
wait
here
for
me
in
the
shelter
of
that
rock
and
i
wo
be
gone
long
then
she
told
him
what
he
would
be
too
young
to
really
understand
i
not
going
to
cry
any
more
and
i
know
now
what
i
must
do
going
to
make
sure
that
there
is
a
tomorrow
for
you
always
to
the
last
breath
of
my
life
the
bright
blue
star
dimmed
and
the
others
faded
away
dawn
touched
the
sky
bringing
with
it
a
coldness
that
frosted
the
steel
of
the
rifle
in
john
prentiss
hands
and
formed
beads
of
ice
on
his
gray
mustache
there
was
a
stirring
in
the
area
behind
him
as
the
weary
rejects
prepared
to
face
the
new
day
and
the
sound
of
a
child
whimpering
from
the
cold
there
had
been
no
time
the
evening
before
to
gather
wood
for
fires
prowlers
the
warning
cry
came
from
an
outer
guard
and
black
shadows
were
suddenly
sweeping
out
of
the
dark
dawn
they
were
things
that
might
have
been
half
wolf
half
tiger
each
of
them
three
hundred
pounds
of
incredible
ferocity
with
eyes
blazing
like
yellow
fire
in
their
faces
they
came
like
the
wind
in
a
flowing
black
wave
and
ripped
through
the
outer
guard
line
as
though
it
had
not
existed
the
inner
guards
fired
in
a
chattering
roll
of
gunshots
trying
to
turn
them
and
prentiss
rifle
licked
out
pale
tongues
of
flame
as
he
added
his
own
fire
the
prowlers
came
on
breaking
through
but
part
of
them
went
down
and
the
others
were
swerved
by
the
fire
so
that
they
struck
only
the
outer
edge
of
the
area
where
the
rejects
were
grouped
at
that
distance
they
blended
into
the
dark
ground
so
that
he
could
not
find
them
in
the
sights
of
his
rifle
he
could
only
watch
helplessly
and
see
a
woman
caught
in
their
path
trying
to
run
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
already
knowing
it
was
too
late
a
man
was
running
toward
her
slow
in
the
high
gravity
an
axe
in
his
hands
and
his
cursing
a
raging
savage
snarl
for
a
moment
her
white
face
was
turned
in
helpless
appeal
to
him
and
the
others
then
the
prowlers
were
upon
her
and
she
fell
deliberately
going
to
the
ground
with
her
child
hugged
in
her
arms
beneath
her
so
that
her
body
would
protect
it
the
prowlers
passed
over
her
pausing
for
an
instant
to
slash
the
life
from
her
and
raced
on
again
they
vanished
back
into
the
outer
darkness
the
farther
guards
firing
futilely
and
there
was
a
silence
but
for
the
distant
hysterical
sobbing
of
a
woman
it
had
happened
within
seconds
the
fifth
prowler
attack
that
night
and
the
mildest
full
dawn
had
come
by
the
time
he
replaced
the
guards
killed
by
the
last
attack
and
made
the
rounds
of
the
other
guard
lines
he
came
back
by
the
place
where
the
prowlers
had
killed
the
woman
walking
wearily
against
the
pull
of
gravity
she
lay
with
her
dark
hair
tumbled
and
stained
with
blood
her
white
face
turned
up
to
the
reddening
sky
and
he
saw
her
clearly
for
the
first
time
it
was
irene
he
stopped
gripping
the
cold
steel
of
the
rifle
and
not
feeling
the
rear
sight
as
it
cut
into
his
hand
irene
he
had
not
known
she
was
on
ragnarok
he
had
not
seen
her
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
he
had
hoped
she
and
billy
were
safe
among
the
acceptables
with
dale
there
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
a
girl
in
a
red
skirt
stopped
beside
him
her
glance
going
over
him
curiously
the
little
boy
he
asked
do
you
know
if
he
all
right
the
prowlers
cut
up
his
face
but
he
be
all
right
she
said
i
came
back
after
his
clothes
are
you
going
to
look
after
him
someone
has
to
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
guess
i
was
soft
enough
to
elect
myself
for
the
job
why
was
his
mother
a
friend
of
yours
she
was
my
daughter
he
said
oh
for
a
moment
the
bold
brassy
look
was
gone
from
her
face
like
a
mask
that
had
slipped
i
sorry
and
i
take
care
of
billy
the
first
objection
to
his
assumption
of
leadership
occurred
an
hour
later
the
prowlers
had
withdrawn
with
the
coming
of
full
daylight
and
wood
had
been
carried
from
the
trees
to
build
fires
mary
one
of
the
volunteer
cooks
was
asking
two
men
to
carry
her
some
water
when
he
approached
the
smaller
man
picked
up
one
of
the
clumsy
containers
hastily
improvised
from
canvas
and
started
toward
the
creek
the
other
a
big
man
did
not
move
we
have
to
have
water
mary
said
people
are
hungry
and
cold
and
sick
the
man
continued
to
squat
by
the
fire
his
hands
extended
to
its
warmth
name
someone
else
he
said
but
she
looked
at
prentiss
in
uncertainty
he
went
to
the
man
knowing
there
would
be
violence
and
welcoming
it
as
something
to
help
drive
away
the
vision
of
irene
pale
cold
face
under
the
red
sky
she
asked
you
to
get
her
some
water
he
said
get
it
the
man
looked
up
at
him
studying
him
with
deliberate
insolence
then
he
got
to
his
feet
his
heavy
shoulders
hunched
challengingly
i
have
to
set
you
straight
old
timer
he
said
no
one
has
appointed
you
the
head
cheese
around
here
now
there
the
container
you
want
filled
and
over
there
he
made
a
small
motion
with
one
hand
is
the
creek
do
you
know
what
to
do
yes
he
said
i
know
what
to
do
he
brought
the
butt
of
the
rifle
smashing
up
it
struck
the
man
under
the
chin
and
there
was
a
sharp
cracking
sound
as
his
jawbone
snapped
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
there
was
an
expression
of
stupefied
amazement
on
his
face
then
his
eyes
glazed
and
he
slumped
to
the
ground
with
his
broken
jaw
setting
askew
all
right
he
said
to
mary
now
you
go
ahead
and
name
somebody
else
he
found
that
the
prowlers
had
killed
seventy
during
the
night
one
hundred
more
had
died
from
the
hell
fever
that
often
followed
exposure
and
killed
within
an
hour
he
went
the
half
mile
to
the
group
that
had
arrived
on
the
second
cruiser
as
soon
as
he
had
eaten
a
delayed
breakfast
he
saw
before
he
had
quite
reached
the
other
group
that
the
lieutenant
commander
vincent
lake
was
in
charge
of
it
lake
a
tall
man
with
pale
blue
eyes
under
pale
brows
walked
forth
to
meet
him
as
soon
as
he
recognized
him
glad
to
see
you
still
alive
lake
greeted
him
i
thought
that
second
gern
blast
got
you
along
with
the
others
i
was
visiting
midship
and
was
home
when
it
happened
he
said
he
looked
at
lake
group
of
rejects
in
their
misery
and
uncertainty
so
much
like
his
own
and
asked
how
was
it
last
night
bad
damned
bad
lake
said
prowlers
and
hell
fever
and
no
wood
for
fires
two
hundred
died
last
night
i
came
down
to
see
if
anyone
was
in
charge
here
and
to
tell
them
that
we
have
to
move
into
the
woods
at
once
today
we
have
plenty
of
wood
for
the
fires
there
some
protection
from
the
wind
and
by
combining
our
defenses
we
can
stand
off
the
prowlers
better
lake
agreed
when
the
brief
discussion
of
plans
was
finished
he
asked
how
much
do
you
know
about
ragnarok
not
much
prentiss
answered
we
did
stay
to
study
it
very
long
there
are
no
heavy
metals
on
ragnarok
other
sun
its
position
in
the
advance
of
the
resources
of
any
value
we
gave
ragnarok
a
quick
survey
and
when
the
sixth
man
died
we
marked
it
on
the
chart
as
uninhabitable
and
went
on
our
way
as
you
probably
know
that
bright
blue
star
is
ragnarok
other
sun
it
position
in
the
advance
of
the
yellow
sun
shows
the
season
to
be
early
spring
when
summer
comes
ragnarok
will
swing
between
the
two
suns
and
the
heat
will
be
something
no
human
has
ever
endured
nor
the
cold
when
winter
comes
i
know
of
no
edible
plants
although
there
might
be
some
there
are
a
few
species
of
animals
they
scavengers
and
a
herbivore
we
called
the
woods
goat
the
prowlers
are
the
dominant
form
of
life
on
ragnarok
and
i
suspect
their
intelligence
is
a
good
deal
higher
than
we
would
like
it
to
be
there
will
be
a
constant
battle
for
survival
with
them
there
another
animal
not
as
intelligent
as
the
prowlers
but
just
as
dangerous
the
unicorn
the
unicorns
are
big
and
fast
and
they
travel
in
herds
i
have
seen
any
here
so
far
i
hope
we
do
at
the
lower
elevations
are
the
swamp
crawlers
they
unadulterated
nightmares
i
hope
they
do
go
to
these
higher
elevations
in
the
summer
the
prowlers
and
the
hell
fever
the
gravity
and
heat
and
cold
and
starvation
will
be
enough
for
us
to
have
to
fight
i
see
lake
said
he
smiled
a
smile
that
was
as
bleak
as
moonlight
on
an
arctic
glacier
remember
the
promise
the
gerns
made
the
rejects
he
looked
out
across
the
camp
at
the
snow
whipping
from
the
frosty
hills
at
the
dead
and
the
dying
and
a
little
girl
trying
vainly
to
awaken
her
brother
they
were
condemned
without
reason
without
a
chance
to
live
he
said
so
many
of
them
are
so
young
and
when
you
young
it
too
soon
to
have
to
die
prentiss
returned
to
his
own
group
the
dead
were
buried
in
shallow
graves
and
inventory
was
taken
of
the
promised
ample
supplies
these
were
only
the
few
personal
possessions
the
rejects
had
been
permitted
to
take
plus
a
small
amount
of
food
the
gerns
had
taken
from
the
stores
the
gerns
had
been
forced
to
provide
the
rejects
with
at
least
a
little
food
had
they
openly
left
them
to
starve
the
acceptables
whose
families
were
among
the
rejects
might
have
rebelled
inventory
of
the
firearms
and
ammunition
showed
the
total
to
be
discouragingly
small
they
would
have
to
learn
how
to
make
and
use
bows
and
arrows
as
soon
as
possible
with
the
first
party
of
guards
and
workmen
following
him
prentiss
went
to
the
tributary
valley
that
emptied
into
the
central
valley
a
mile
to
the
north
it
was
as
good
a
camp
site
as
could
be
hoped
for
wide
and
thickly
spotted
with
groves
of
trees
a
creek
running
down
its
center
the
workmen
began
the
construction
of
shelters
and
he
climbed
up
the
side
of
the
nearer
hill
he
reached
its
top
his
breath
coming
fast
in
the
gravity
that
was
the
equivalent
of
a
burden
half
his
own
weight
and
saw
what
the
surrounding
terrain
was
like
to
the
south
beyond
the
barren
valley
the
land
could
be
seen
dropping
in
its
long
sweep
to
the
southern
lowlands
where
the
unicorns
and
swamp
crawlers
lived
to
the
north
the
hills
climbed
gently
for
miles
then
ended
under
the
steeply
sloping
face
of
an
immense
plateau
the
plateau
reached
from
western
to
eastern
horizon
still
white
with
the
snows
of
winter
and
looming
so
high
above
the
world
below
that
the
clouds
brushed
it
and
half
obscured
it
he
went
back
down
the
hill
as
lake
men
appeared
they
started
work
on
what
would
be
a
continuation
of
his
own
camp
and
he
told
lake
what
he
had
seen
from
the
hill
we
between
the
lowlands
and
the
highlands
he
said
this
will
be
as
near
to
a
temperate
altitude
as
ragnarok
has
we
survive
here
or
else
there
no
other
place
for
us
to
go
an
overcast
darkened
the
sky
at
noon
and
the
wind
died
down
to
almost
nothing
there
was
a
feeling
of
waiting
tension
in
the
air
and
he
went
back
to
the
rejects
to
speed
their
move
into
the
woods
they
were
already
going
in
scattered
groups
accompanied
by
prowler
guards
but
there
was
no
organization
and
it
would
be
too
long
before
the
last
of
them
were
safely
in
the
new
camp
he
could
not
be
two
places
at
once
he
needed
a
subleader
to
oversee
the
move
of
the
rejects
and
their
possessions
into
the
woods
and
their
placement
after
they
got
there
he
found
the
man
he
wanted
already
helping
the
rejects
get
started
a
thin
quiet
man
named
henry
anders
who
had
fought
well
against
the
prowlers
the
night
before
even
though
his
determination
had
been
greater
than
his
marksmanship
he
was
the
type
people
instinctively
liked
and
trusted
a
good
choice
for
the
subleader
whose
job
it
would
be
to
handle
the
multitude
of
details
in
camp
while
he
prentiss
and
a
second
subleader
he
would
select
handled
the
defense
of
the
camp
and
the
hunting
i
do
like
this
overcast
he
told
anders
something
brewing
get
everyone
moved
and
at
work
helping
build
shelters
as
soon
as
you
can
i
can
have
most
of
them
there
within
an
hour
or
two
anders
said
some
of
the
older
people
though
will
have
to
take
it
slow
this
gravity
it
already
getting
the
hearts
of
some
of
them
how
are
the
children
taking
the
gravity
he
asked
the
babies
and
the
very
young
it
hard
to
tell
about
them
yet
but
the
children
from
about
four
on
up
get
tired
quickly
go
to
sleep
and
when
they
wake
up
they
sort
of
bounced
back
out
of
it
maybe
they
can
adapt
to
some
extent
to
this
gravity
he
thought
of
what
lake
had
said
that
morning
many
of
them
are
so
young
and
when
you
young
it
too
soon
to
have
to
maybe
the
gerns
made
a
mistake
maybe
terran
children
are
as
easy
to
kill
as
they
thought
it
your
job
and
mine
and
others
to
give
the
children
the
chance
to
prove
the
gerns
wrong
he
went
his
way
again
to
pass
by
the
place
where
julia
the
girl
who
had
become
billy
was
preparing
to
go
to
the
new
camp
it
was
the
second
time
for
him
to
see
billy
that
morning
the
first
time
billy
had
still
been
stunned
with
grief
and
at
the
sight
of
his
grandfather
he
had
been
unable
to
keep
from
breaking
the
gern
hit
her
he
had
sobbed
his
torn
face
bleeding
anew
as
it
twisted
in
crying
he
hurt
her
and
daddy
was
gone
and
then
and
then
the
other
things
killed
her
but
now
he
had
had
a
little
time
to
accept
what
had
happened
and
he
was
changed
he
was
someone
much
older
almost
a
man
trapped
for
a
while
in
the
body
of
a
boy
i
guess
this
is
all
billy
julia
was
saying
as
she
gathered
up
her
scanty
possessions
and
irene
bag
get
your
teddy
bear
and
we
go
billy
went
to
his
teddy
bear
and
knelt
down
to
pick
it
up
then
he
stopped
and
said
something
that
sounded
like
no
he
laid
the
teddy
bear
back
down
wiping
a
little
dust
from
its
face
as
in
a
last
gesture
of
farewell
and
stood
up
to
face
julia
i
do
think
i
want
to
play
with
my
teddy
bear
any
more
he
said
i
do
think
i
ever
want
to
play
at
all
anymore
then
he
went
to
walk
beside
her
leaving
his
teddy
bear
lying
on
the
ground
behind
him
and
with
it
leaving
forever
the
tears
and
laughter
of
childhood
the
overcast
deepened
and
at
midafternoon
dark
storm
clouds
came
driving
in
from
the
west
efforts
were
intensified
to
complete
the
move
before
the
storm
broke
both
in
his
section
of
the
camp
and
in
lake
the
shelters
would
be
of
critical
importance
and
they
were
being
built
of
the
materials
most
quickly
available
dead
limbs
brush
and
the
limited
amount
of
canvas
and
blankets
the
rejects
had
they
would
be
inadequate
protection
but
there
was
no
time
to
build
anything
better
it
seemed
only
a
few
minutes
until
the
black
clouds
were
overhead
rolling
and
racing
at
an
incredible
velocity
with
them
came
the
deep
roar
of
the
high
wind
that
drove
them
and
the
wind
on
the
ground
began
to
stir
restlessly
in
response
like
some
monster
awakening
to
the
call
of
its
kind
prentiss
knew
already
who
he
wanted
as
his
other
subleader
he
found
him
hard
at
work
helping
build
shelters
howard
craig
a
powerfully
muscled
man
with
a
face
as
hard
and
grim
as
a
cliff
of
granite
it
had
been
craig
who
had
tried
to
save
irene
from
the
prowlers
that
morning
with
only
an
axe
as
a
weapon
prentiss
knew
him
slightly
and
craig
still
did
not
know
irene
had
been
his
daughter
craig
had
been
one
of
the
field
engineers
for
what
would
have
been
the
athena
geological
survey
he
had
had
a
wife
a
frail
blonde
girl
who
had
been
the
first
of
all
to
die
of
hell
fever
the
night
before
and
he
still
had
their
three
small
children
we
stop
with
the
shelters
we
already
have
built
he
told
craig
it
will
take
all
the
time
left
to
us
to
reinforce
them
against
the
wind
i
need
someone
to
help
me
in
addition
to
anders
you
the
one
i
want
send
some
young
and
men
back
to
last
night
camp
to
cut
all
the
strips
of
prowler
skins
they
can
get
everything
about
the
shelters
will
have
to
be
lashed
down
to
something
solid
see
if
you
can
find
some
experienced
outdoorsmen
to
help
you
check
the
jobs
and
tell
anders
that
women
and
children
only
will
be
placed
in
the
shelters
there
will
be
no
room
for
anyone
else
and
if
any
man
no
matter
what
the
excuse
crowds
out
a
woman
or
child
i
personally
kill
him
you
need
bother
craig
said
he
smiled
with
savage
mirthlessness
i
be
glad
to
take
care
of
any
such
incidents
prentiss
saw
to
it
that
the
piles
of
wood
for
the
guard
fires
were
ready
to
be
lighted
when
the
time
came
he
ordered
all
guards
to
their
stations
there
to
get
what
rest
they
could
they
would
have
no
rest
at
all
after
darkness
came
he
met
lake
at
the
north
end
of
his
own
group
camp
where
it
merged
with
lake
group
and
no
guard
line
was
needed
lake
told
him
that
his
camp
would
be
as
well
prepared
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
within
another
hour
by
then
the
wind
in
the
trees
was
growing
swiftly
stronger
slapping
harder
and
harder
at
the
shelters
and
it
seemed
doubtful
that
the
storm
would
hold
off
for
an
hour
but
lake
was
given
his
hour
plus
half
of
another
then
deep
dusk
came
although
it
was
not
quite
sundown
prentiss
ordered
all
the
guard
fires
lighted
and
all
the
women
and
children
into
the
shelters
fifteen
minutes
later
the
storm
finally
broke
it
came
as
a
roaring
downpour
of
cold
rain
complete
darkness
came
with
it
and
the
wind
rose
to
a
velocity
that
made
the
trees
lean
an
hour
went
by
and
the
wind
increased
smashing
at
the
shelters
with
a
violence
they
had
not
been
built
to
withstand
the
prowler
skin
lashings
held
but
the
canvas
and
blankets
were
ripped
into
streamers
that
cracked
like
rifle
shots
in
the
wind
before
they
were
torn
completely
loose
and
flung
into
the
night
one
by
one
the
guard
fires
went
out
and
the
rain
continued
growing
colder
and
driven
in
almost
horizontal
sheets
by
the
wind
the
women
and
children
huddled
in
chilled
misery
in
what
meager
protection
the
torn
shelters
still
gave
and
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
to
help
them
the
rain
turned
to
snow
at
midnight
a
howling
blizzard
through
which
prentiss
light
could
penetrate
but
a
few
feet
as
he
made
his
rounds
he
walked
with
slogging
weariness
forcing
himself
on
he
was
no
longer
young
he
was
fifty
and
he
had
had
little
rest
he
had
known
of
course
that
successful
leadership
would
involve
more
sacrifice
on
his
part
than
on
the
part
of
those
he
led
he
could
have
shunned
responsibility
and
his
personal
welfare
would
have
benefited
he
had
lived
on
alien
worlds
almost
half
his
life
with
a
rifle
and
a
knife
he
could
have
lived
until
ragnarok
finally
killed
him
with
much
less
effort
than
that
required
of
him
as
leader
but
such
an
action
had
been
repugnant
to
him
unthinkable
what
he
knew
of
survival
on
hostile
worlds
might
help
the
others
to
survive
so
he
had
assumed
command
tolerating
no
objections
and
disregarding
the
fact
that
he
would
be
shortening
his
already
short
time
to
live
on
ragnarok
it
was
he
supposed
some
old
instinct
that
forbade
the
individual
to
stand
aside
and
let
the
group
die
the
snow
stopped
an
hour
later
and
the
wind
died
to
a
frigid
moaning
the
clouds
thinned
broke
apart
and
the
giant
star
looked
down
upon
the
land
with
its
cold
blue
light
the
prowlers
came
then
they
feinted
against
the
east
and
west
guard
lines
then
hit
the
south
line
in
massed
ferocious
attack
twenty
got
through
past
the
slaughtered
south
guards
and
charged
into
the
interior
of
the
camp
as
they
did
so
the
call
prearranged
by
him
in
case
of
such
an
event
went
up
the
guard
lines
emergency
guards
east
and
west
in
in
the
camp
above
the
triumphant
demoniac
yammering
of
the
prowlers
came
the
screams
of
women
the
thinner
cries
of
children
and
the
shouting
and
cursing
of
men
as
they
tried
to
fight
the
prowlers
with
knives
and
clubs
then
the
emergency
guards
every
third
man
from
the
east
and
west
lines
came
plunging
through
the
snow
firing
as
they
came
the
prowlers
launched
themselves
away
from
their
victims
and
toward
the
guards
leaving
a
woman
to
stagger
aimlessly
with
blood
spurting
from
a
severed
artery
and
splashing
dark
in
the
starlight
on
the
snow
the
air
was
filled
with
the
cracking
of
gunfire
and
the
deep
savage
snarling
of
the
prowlers
half
of
the
prowlers
broke
through
leaving
seven
dead
guards
behind
them
the
others
lay
in
the
snow
where
they
had
fallen
and
the
surviving
emergency
guards
turned
to
hurry
back
to
their
stations
reloading
as
they
went
the
wounded
woman
had
crumpled
down
in
the
snow
and
a
first
aid
man
knelt
over
her
he
straightened
shaking
his
head
and
joined
the
others
as
they
searched
for
injured
among
the
prowlers
victims
they
found
no
injured
only
the
dead
the
prowlers
killed
with
grim
efficiency
john
john
chiara
the
young
doctor
hurried
toward
him
his
dark
eyes
were
worried
behind
his
frosted
glasses
and
his
eyebrows
were
coated
with
ice
the
wood
is
soaked
he
said
it
going
to
be
some
time
before
we
can
get
fires
going
there
are
babies
that
will
freeze
to
death
before
then
prentiss
looked
at
the
prowlers
lying
in
the
snow
and
motioned
toward
them
they
warm
have
their
guts
and
lungs
taken
out
what
then
chiara
eyes
lighted
with
comprehension
and
he
hurried
away
without
further
questions
prentiss
went
on
to
make
the
rounds
of
the
guards
when
he
returned
he
saw
that
his
order
had
been
obeyed
the
prowlers
lay
in
the
snow
as
before
their
savage
faces
still
twisted
in
their
dying
snarls
but
snug
and
warm
inside
them
babies
slept
the
prowlers
attacked
again
and
again
and
when
the
wan
sun
lifted
to
shine
down
on
the
white
frozen
land
there
were
five
hundred
dead
in
prentiss
camp
three
hundred
by
hell
fever
and
two
hundred
by
prowler
attacks
five
hundred
and
that
had
been
only
one
night
on
ragnarok
lake
reported
over
six
hundred
dead
i
hope
he
said
with
bitter
hatred
that
the
gerns
slept
comfortably
last
night
we
have
to
build
a
wall
around
the
camp
to
hold
out
the
prowlers
prentiss
said
we
do
dare
keep
using
up
what
little
ammunition
we
have
at
the
rate
we
used
it
the
last
two
nights
that
will
be
a
big
job
in
this
gravity
lake
said
we
have
to
crowd
both
groups
in
together
to
let
its
circumference
be
as
small
as
possible
it
was
the
way
prentiss
had
planned
to
do
it
one
thing
would
have
to
be
settled
with
lake
there
could
not
be
two
independent
leaders
over
the
merged
groups
lake
watching
him
said
i
think
we
can
get
along
alien
worlds
are
your
specialty
rather
than
mine
and
according
to
the
ragnarok
law
of
averages
there
will
be
only
one
of
us
pretty
soon
anyway
all
were
moved
to
the
center
of
the
camp
area
that
day
and
when
the
prowlers
came
that
night
they
found
a
ring
of
guards
and
fires
through
which
they
could
penetrate
only
with
heavy
sacrifices
there
was
warmth
to
the
sun
the
next
morning
and
the
snow
began
to
melt
work
was
commenced
on
the
stockade
wall
it
would
have
to
be
twelve
feet
high
so
the
prowlers
could
not
jump
over
it
and
since
the
prowlers
had
the
sharp
claws
and
climbing
ability
of
cats
its
top
would
have
to
be
surmounted
with
a
row
of
sharp
projecting
stakes
these
would
be
set
in
sockets
in
the
top
rail
and
tied
down
with
strips
of
prowler
skin
the
trees
east
of
camp
were
festooned
for
a
great
distance
with
the
remnants
of
canvas
and
cloth
the
wind
had
left
there
a
party
of
boys
protected
by
the
usual
prowler
guards
was
sent
out
to
climb
the
trees
and
recover
it
all
of
it
down
to
the
smallest
fragment
was
turned
over
to
the
women
who
were
physically
incapable
of
helping
work
on
the
stockade
wall
they
began
patiently
sewing
the
rags
and
tatters
back
into
usable
form
again
the
first
hunting
party
went
out
and
returned
with
six
of
the
woods
goats
each
as
large
as
an
earth
deer
the
hunters
reported
the
woods
goats
to
be
hard
to
stalk
and
dangerous
when
cornered
one
hunter
was
killed
and
another
injured
because
of
not
knowing
that
they
also
brought
in
a
few
of
the
scavenger
animals
they
were
all
legs
and
teeth
and
bristly
fur
the
meat
almost
inedible
it
would
be
a
waste
of
the
limited
ammunition
to
shoot
any
more
of
them
there
was
a
black
barked
tree
which
the
dunbar
expedition
had
called
the
lance
tree
because
of
its
slender
straightly
outthrust
limbs
its
wood
was
as
hard
as
hickory
and
as
springy
as
cedar
prentiss
found
two
amateur
archers
who
were
sure
they
could
make
efficient
bows
and
arrows
out
of
the
lance
tree
limbs
he
gave
them
the
job
together
with
helpers
the
days
turned
suddenly
hot
with
nights
that
still
went
below
freezing
the
hell
fever
took
a
constant
relentless
toll
they
needed
adequate
shelters
but
the
dwindling
supply
of
ammunition
and
the
nightly
prowler
attacks
made
the
need
for
a
stockade
wall
even
more
imperative
the
shelters
would
have
to
wait
he
went
looking
for
chiara
one
evening
and
found
him
just
leaving
one
of
the
makeshift
shelters
a
boy
lay
inside
it
his
face
flushed
with
hell
fever
and
his
eyes
too
bright
and
too
dark
as
he
looked
up
into
the
face
of
his
mother
who
sat
beside
him
she
was
and
silent
as
she
looked
down
at
him
but
she
was
holding
his
hand
in
hers
tightly
desperately
as
though
she
might
that
way
somehow
keep
him
from
leaving
her
prentiss
walked
beside
chiara
and
when
the
shelter
was
behind
them
he
asked
there
no
hope
none
chiara
said
there
never
is
with
hell
fever
chiara
had
changed
he
was
no
longer
the
stocky
cheerful
man
he
had
been
on
the
whose
brown
eyes
had
smiled
at
the
world
through
thick
glasses
and
who
had
laughed
and
joked
as
he
assured
his
patients
that
all
would
soon
be
well
with
them
he
was
thin
and
his
face
was
haggard
with
worry
he
had
in
his
quiet
way
been
fully
as
valiant
as
any
of
those
who
had
fought
the
prowlers
he
had
worked
day
and
night
to
fight
a
form
of
death
he
could
not
see
and
against
which
he
had
no
weapon
the
boy
is
dying
chiara
said
he
knows
it
and
his
mother
knows
it
i
told
them
the
medicine
i
gave
him
might
help
it
was
a
lie
to
try
to
make
it
a
little
easier
for
both
of
them
before
the
end
comes
the
medicine
i
gave
him
was
a
salt
tablet
that
all
i
have
and
then
with
the
first
bitterness
prentiss
had
ever
seen
him
display
chiara
said
you
call
me
everyone
does
i
not
i
only
a
intern
i
do
the
best
i
know
how
to
do
but
it
enough
it
will
never
be
enough
what
you
have
to
learn
here
is
something
no
earth
doctor
knows
or
could
teach
you
he
said
you
have
to
have
time
to
learn
and
you
need
equipment
and
drugs
if
i
could
have
antibiotics
and
other
drugs
i
wanted
to
get
a
supply
from
the
dispensary
but
the
gerns
would
let
me
go
some
of
the
ragnarok
plants
might
be
of
value
if
a
person
could
find
the
right
ones
i
just
came
from
a
talk
with
anders
about
that
provide
you
with
anything
possible
in
the
way
of
equipment
and
supplies
for
research
anything
in
the
camp
you
need
to
try
to
save
lives
be
at
your
shelter
tonight
to
see
what
you
want
do
you
want
to
try
it
yes
of
course
chiara
eyes
lighted
with
new
hope
it
might
take
a
long
time
to
find
a
cure
maybe
we
never
would
but
i
like
to
have
help
so
i
could
try
i
like
to
be
able
some
day
once
again
to
say
to
a
scared
kid
this
medicine
and
in
the
morning
you
be
better
and
know
i
told
the
truth
the
nightly
prowler
attacks
continued
and
the
supply
of
ammunition
diminished
it
would
be
some
time
before
men
were
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
bows
and
arrows
that
were
being
made
and
work
on
the
wall
was
pushed
ahead
with
all
speed
possible
no
one
was
exempt
from
labor
on
it
who
could
as
much
as
carry
the
pointed
stakes
children
down
to
the
youngest
worked
alongside
the
men
and
women
the
work
was
made
many
times
more
exhausting
by
the
gravity
people
moved
heavily
at
their
jobs
and
even
at
night
there
was
no
surcease
from
the
gravity
they
could
only
go
into
a
sleep
in
which
there
was
no
real
rest
and
from
which
they
awoke
tired
and
aching
each
morning
there
would
be
some
who
did
not
awaken
at
all
though
their
hearts
had
been
sound
enough
for
working
on
earth
or
athena
the
killing
labor
was
recognized
as
necessary
however
and
there
were
no
complaints
until
the
morning
he
was
accosted
by
peter
bemmon
he
had
seen
bemmon
several
times
on
the
a
big
man
who
had
attached
much
importance
to
his
role
as
a
minor
member
of
the
athena
planning
board
but
even
on
the
bemmon
had
felt
he
merited
a
still
higher
position
and
his
ingratiating
attitude
when
before
his
superiors
had
become
one
of
insinuations
concerning
their
ability
as
compared
with
his
when
their
backs
were
turned
this
resentment
had
taken
new
form
on
ragnarok
where
his
former
position
was
of
utterly
no
importance
to
anyone
and
his
lack
of
any
skills
or
outdoor
experience
made
him
only
one
worker
among
others
the
sun
was
shining
mercilessly
hot
the
day
bemmon
chose
to
challenge
prentiss
wisdom
as
leader
bemmon
was
cutting
and
sharpening
stakes
a
job
the
anders
had
given
him
when
bemmon
had
insisted
his
heart
was
on
the
verge
of
failure
from
doing
heavier
work
prentiss
was
in
a
hurry
and
would
have
gone
on
past
him
but
bemmon
halted
him
with
a
sharp
command
you
wait
a
minute
bemmon
had
a
hatchet
in
his
hand
but
only
one
stake
lay
on
the
ground
and
his
face
was
red
with
anger
not
exertion
prentiss
stopped
wondering
if
bemmon
was
going
to
ask
for
a
broken
jaw
and
bemmon
came
to
him
how
long
bemmon
asked
anger
making
his
voice
a
little
thick
do
you
think
i
tolerate
this
absurd
situation
what
situation
prentiss
asked
this
stupid
insistence
upon
confining
me
to
manual
labor
i
the
single
member
on
ragnarok
of
the
athena
planning
board
and
surely
you
can
see
that
this
bumbling
confusion
of
these
people
bemmon
indicated
the
hurrying
laboring
men
women
and
children
around
them
can
be
transformed
into
efficient
organized
effort
only
through
proper
supervision
yet
my
abilities
along
such
lines
are
ignored
and
i
been
forced
to
work
as
a
common
laborer
a
wood
chopper
he
flung
the
hatchet
down
viciously
into
the
rocks
at
his
feet
breathing
heavily
with
resentment
and
challenge
i
demand
the
respect
to
which
i
entitled
look
prentiss
said
he
pointed
to
the
group
just
then
going
past
them
a
girl
was
bent
almost
double
under
the
weight
of
the
pole
she
was
carrying
her
once
pretty
face
flushed
and
sweating
behind
her
two
boys
were
dragging
a
still
larger
pole
behind
them
came
several
small
children
each
of
them
carrying
as
many
of
the
pointed
stakes
as
he
or
she
could
walk
under
no
matter
if
it
was
only
one
all
of
them
were
trying
to
hurry
to
accomplish
as
much
as
possible
and
no
one
was
complaining
even
though
they
were
already
staggering
with
weariness
so
you
think
you
entitled
to
more
respect
prentiss
asked
those
kids
would
work
harder
if
you
were
giving
them
orders
from
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
is
that
what
you
want
bemmon
lips
thinned
and
hatred
was
like
a
sheen
on
his
face
prentiss
looked
from
the
single
stake
bemmon
had
cut
that
morning
to
white
unblistered
hands
he
looked
at
the
hatchet
that
bemmon
had
thrown
down
in
the
rocks
and
at
the
v
notch
broken
in
its
blade
it
had
been
the
best
of
the
very
few
hatchets
they
had
the
next
time
you
even
nick
that
hatchet
i
going
to
split
your
skull
with
it
he
said
pick
it
up
and
get
back
to
work
i
mean
you
have
broken
blisters
on
every
finger
tonight
or
you
go
on
the
force
tomorrow
now
move
what
bemmon
had
thought
to
be
his
wrath
deserted
him
before
fury
he
stooped
to
obey
the
order
but
the
hatred
remained
on
his
face
and
when
the
hatchet
was
in
his
hands
he
made
a
last
attempt
to
bluster
the
day
may
come
when
we
refuse
to
tolerate
any
longer
your
sadistic
displays
of
authority
good
prentiss
said
anyone
who
does
like
my
style
is
welcome
to
try
to
change
it
or
to
try
to
replace
me
with
knives
or
clubs
rifles
or
broken
hatchets
bemmon
any
way
you
want
it
and
any
time
you
want
it
i
bemmon
eyes
went
from
the
hatchet
in
his
half
raised
hand
to
the
long
knife
in
prentiss
belt
he
swallowed
with
a
convulsive
jerk
of
his
adam
apple
and
his
arm
suddenly
wilted
i
do
want
to
fight
to
replace
you
he
swallowed
again
and
his
face
forced
itself
into
a
sickly
attempt
at
an
ingratiating
smile
i
did
mean
to
imply
any
disrespect
for
you
or
the
good
job
you
doing
i
very
sorry
then
he
hurried
away
like
a
man
glad
to
escape
and
began
to
chop
stakes
with
amazing
speed
but
the
sullen
hatred
had
not
been
concealed
by
the
ingratiating
smile
and
prentiss
knew
bemmon
was
a
man
who
would
always
be
his
enemy
the
days
dragged
by
in
the
weary
routine
but
overworked
muscles
slowly
strengthened
and
people
moved
with
a
little
less
laborious
effort
on
the
twentieth
day
the
wall
was
finally
completed
and
the
camp
was
prowler
proof
but
the
spring
weather
was
a
mad
succession
of
heat
and
cold
and
storm
that
caused
the
hell
fever
to
take
its
toll
each
day
and
there
was
no
relaxation
from
the
grueling
labor
weatherproof
shelters
had
to
be
built
as
rapidly
as
possible
so
the
work
of
constructing
them
began
wearily
sometimes
almost
hopelessly
but
without
complaint
other
than
to
hate
and
curse
the
gerns
more
than
ever
there
was
no
more
trouble
from
bemmon
prentiss
had
almost
forgotten
him
when
he
was
publicly
challenged
one
night
by
a
burly
threatening
man
named
haggar
you
bragged
that
you
fight
any
man
who
dares
disagree
with
you
haggar
said
loudly
well
here
i
am
we
use
knives
and
before
they
even
have
time
to
bury
you
tonight
i
goin
to
have
your
stooges
kicked
out
and
replaced
with
men
who
give
us
competent
leadership
instead
of
blunderin
authoritarianism
prentiss
noticed
that
haggar
seemed
to
have
a
little
difficulty
pronouncing
the
last
word
as
though
he
had
learned
it
only
recently
i
be
glad
to
accommodate
you
prentiss
said
mildly
go
get
yourself
a
knife
haggar
already
had
one
a
butcher
knife
and
the
duel
began
haggar
was
surprisingly
adept
with
his
knife
but
he
had
never
had
the
training
and
experience
in
combat
that
interstellar
explorers
such
as
prentiss
had
haggar
was
good
but
considerably
far
from
good
enough
prentiss
did
not
kill
him
he
had
no
compunctions
about
doing
such
a
thing
but
it
would
have
been
an
unnecessary
waste
of
needed
manpower
he
gave
haggar
a
carefully
painful
and
bloody
lesson
that
thoroughly
banished
all
his
lust
for
conflict
without
seriously
injuring
him
the
duel
was
over
within
a
minute
after
it
began
bemmon
who
had
witnessed
the
challenge
with
keen
interest
and
then
watched
haggar
defeat
with
agitation
became
excessively
friendly
and
flattering
toward
prentiss
afterward
prentiss
felt
sure
although
he
had
no
proof
that
it
had
been
bemmon
who
had
spurred
the
haggar
into
challenging
him
to
a
duel
if
so
the
sight
of
what
had
happened
to
haggar
must
have
effectively
dampened
bemmon
desire
for
revenge
because
he
became
almost
a
model
worker
as
lake
had
predicted
he
and
prentiss
worked
together
well
lake
calmly
took
a
secondary
role
not
at
all
interested
in
possession
of
authority
but
only
in
the
survival
of
the
rejects
he
spoke
of
the
surrender
of
the
only
once
to
say
i
knew
there
could
be
only
ragnarok
in
this
section
of
space
i
had
to
order
four
thousand
people
to
go
like
sheep
to
what
was
to
be
their
place
of
execution
so
that
four
thousand
more
could
live
as
slaves
that
was
my
last
act
as
an
officer
prentiss
suspected
that
lake
found
it
impossible
not
to
blame
himself
subconsciously
for
what
circumstances
had
forced
him
to
do
it
was
irrational
but
conscientious
men
were
quite
often
a
little
irrational
in
their
sense
of
responsibility
lake
had
two
subleaders
a
genial
man
named
ben
barber
who
would
have
been
a
farmer
on
athena
but
who
made
a
good
subleader
on
ragnarok
and
a
lithe
man
named
karl
schroeder
schroeder
claimed
to
be
but
not
even
the
scars
on
his
face
could
make
him
look
more
than
he
smiled
often
a
little
too
often
prentiss
had
seen
smiles
like
that
before
schroeder
was
the
type
who
could
smile
while
he
killed
a
man
and
he
probably
had
but
if
schroeder
was
a
born
fighter
and
perhaps
killer
they
were
characteristics
that
he
expended
entirely
upon
the
prowlers
he
was
lake
right
hand
man
a
deadly
marksman
and
utterly
without
fear
one
evening
when
lake
had
given
schroeder
some
instructions
concerning
the
next
day
activities
schroeder
answered
him
with
the
smile
and
the
words
i
see
that
it
done
commander
not
lake
said
i
all
of
us
left
our
ranks
titles
and
honors
on
the
the
past
is
dead
for
us
i
see
schroeder
said
the
smile
faded
away
and
he
looked
into
eyes
as
he
asked
and
what
about
our
past
dishonors
disgraces
and
such
they
were
left
on
the
too
lake
said
if
anyone
wants
dishonor
he
have
to
earn
it
all
over
again
that
sounds
fair
schroeder
said
that
sounds
as
fair
as
anyone
could
ever
ask
for
he
turned
away
and
prentiss
saw
what
he
had
noticed
before
black
hair
was
coming
out
light
brown
at
the
roots
it
was
a
color
that
would
better
match
his
light
complexion
and
it
was
the
color
of
hair
that
a
man
named
schrader
wanted
by
the
police
on
venus
had
had
hair
could
be
dyed
identification
cards
could
be
forged
but
it
was
all
something
prentiss
did
not
care
to
pry
into
until
and
if
schroeder
gave
him
reason
to
schroeder
was
a
hard
and
dangerous
man
despite
his
youth
and
sometimes
men
of
that
type
when
the
chips
were
down
exhibited
a
higher
sense
of
duty
than
the
soft
men
who
spoke
piously
of
respect
for
society
and
then
were
afraid
to
face
danger
to
protect
the
society
and
the
people
they
claimed
to
respect
a
lone
prowler
came
on
the
eleventh
night
following
the
completion
it
came
silently
in
the
dead
of
night
and
it
learned
how
to
reach
in
and
tear
apart
the
leather
lashings
that
held
the
pointed
stakes
in
place
and
then
jerk
the
stakes
out
of
their
sockets
it
was
seen
as
it
was
removing
the
third
stake
which
would
have
made
a
large
enough
opening
for
it
to
come
through
and
shot
it
fell
back
and
managed
to
escape
into
the
woods
although
staggering
and
bleeding
the
next
night
the
stockade
was
attacked
by
dozens
of
prowlers
who
simultaneously
began
removing
the
pointed
stakes
in
the
same
manner
employed
by
the
prowler
of
the
night
before
their
attack
was
turned
back
with
heavy
losses
on
both
sides
and
with
a
dismayingly
large
expenditure
of
precious
ammunition
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
how
the
band
of
prowlers
had
learned
to
remove
the
stakes
the
prowler
of
the
night
before
had
told
them
before
it
died
it
was
doubtful
that
the
prowlers
had
a
spoken
language
but
they
had
some
means
of
communication
they
worked
together
and
they
were
highly
intelligent
probably
about
halfway
between
dog
and
man
the
prowlers
were
going
to
be
an
enemy
even
more
formidable
than
prentiss
had
thought
the
missing
stakes
were
replaced
the
next
day
and
the
others
were
tied
down
more
securely
once
again
the
camp
was
prowler
proof
but
only
for
so
long
as
armed
guards
patrolled
inside
the
walls
to
kill
attacking
prowlers
during
the
short
time
it
would
take
them
to
remove
the
stakes
the
hunting
parties
suffered
unusually
heavy
losses
from
prowler
attacks
that
day
and
that
evening
as
the
guards
patrolled
inside
the
walls
lake
said
to
prentiss
the
prowlers
are
so
damnably
persistent
it
is
that
hungry
they
do
kill
us
to
eat
us
they
do
have
any
reason
to
kill
us
they
just
hate
us
they
have
a
reason
prentiss
said
they
doing
the
same
thing
doing
fighting
for
survival
lake
pale
brows
lifted
in
question
the
prowlers
are
the
rulers
of
ragnarok
prentiss
said
they
fought
their
way
up
here
as
men
did
on
earth
until
they
master
of
every
creature
on
their
world
even
of
the
unicorns
and
swamp
crawlers
but
now
we
come
and
they
intelligent
enough
to
know
that
accustomed
to
being
the
dominant
species
ourselves
there
ca
be
two
dominant
species
on
the
same
world
and
they
know
it
men
or
prowlers
in
the
end
one
is
going
to
have
to
go
down
before
the
other
i
suppose
you
right
lake
said
he
looked
at
the
guards
a
fourth
of
them
already
reduced
to
bows
and
arrows
that
they
had
not
yet
had
time
to
learn
how
to
use
if
we
win
the
battle
for
supremacy
it
will
be
a
long
fight
maybe
over
a
period
of
centuries
and
if
the
prowlers
win
it
may
all
be
over
within
a
year
or
two
the
giant
blue
star
that
was
the
other
component
of
ragnarok
binary
grew
swiftly
in
size
as
it
preceded
the
yellow
sun
farther
each
morning
when
summer
came
the
blue
star
would
be
a
sun
as
hot
as
the
yellow
sun
and
ragnarok
would
be
between
them
the
yellow
sun
would
burn
the
land
by
day
and
the
blue
sun
would
sear
it
by
the
night
that
would
not
be
night
then
would
come
the
brief
fall
followed
by
the
long
frozen
winter
when
the
yellow
sun
would
shine
pale
and
cold
far
to
the
south
and
the
blue
sun
would
be
a
star
again
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
miles
away
and
invisible
behind
the
cold
yellow
sun
the
hell
fever
lessened
with
the
completion
of
the
shelters
but
it
still
killed
each
day
chiara
and
his
helpers
worked
with
unfaltering
determination
to
find
a
cure
for
it
but
the
cure
if
there
was
one
eluded
them
the
graves
in
the
cemetery
were
forty
long
by
forty
wide
and
more
were
added
each
day
to
all
the
fact
became
grimly
obvious
they
were
swiftly
dying
out
and
they
had
yet
to
face
ragnarok
at
its
worst
the
old
survival
instincts
asserted
themselves
and
there
were
marriages
among
the
younger
ones
one
of
the
first
to
marry
was
julia
she
stopped
to
talk
to
prentiss
one
evening
she
still
wore
the
red
skirt
now
faded
and
patched
but
her
face
was
tired
and
thoughtful
and
no
longer
bold
is
it
true
john
she
asked
that
only
a
few
of
us
might
be
able
to
have
children
here
and
that
most
of
us
who
tried
to
have
children
in
this
gravity
would
die
for
it
it
true
he
said
but
you
already
knew
that
when
you
married
yes
i
knew
it
there
was
a
little
silence
all
my
life
i
had
fun
and
done
as
i
pleased
the
human
race
did
need
me
and
we
both
knew
it
but
now
none
of
us
can
be
apart
from
the
others
or
be
afraid
of
anything
if
we
selfish
and
afraid
there
will
come
a
time
when
the
last
of
us
will
die
and
there
will
be
nothing
on
ragnarok
to
show
we
were
ever
here
i
do
want
it
to
end
like
that
i
want
there
to
be
children
to
live
after
we
gone
so
i
going
to
try
to
have
a
child
i
not
afraid
and
i
wo
be
when
he
did
not
reply
at
once
she
said
almost
coming
from
me
that
all
sounds
a
little
silly
i
suppose
it
sounds
wise
and
splendid
julia
he
said
and
it
what
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
full
spring
came
and
the
vegetation
burst
into
leaf
and
bud
and
bloom
quickly
for
its
growth
instincts
knew
in
their
mindless
way
how
short
was
the
time
to
grow
and
reproduce
before
the
brown
death
of
summer
came
the
prowlers
were
suddenly
gone
one
day
to
follow
the
spring
north
and
for
a
week
men
could
walk
and
work
outside
the
stockade
without
the
protection
of
armed
guards
then
the
new
peril
appeared
the
one
they
had
not
expected
the
unicorns
the
stockade
wall
was
a
rectangle
behind
them
and
the
blue
star
burned
with
the
brilliance
of
a
dozen
moons
lighting
the
woods
in
blue
shadow
and
azure
light
prentiss
and
the
hunter
walked
a
little
in
front
of
the
two
riflemen
winding
to
keep
in
the
starlit
glades
it
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
next
grove
of
trees
the
hunter
said
in
a
low
voice
fred
was
getting
ready
to
bring
in
the
rest
of
the
woods
goat
he
should
have
been
more
than
ten
minutes
behind
me
and
it
been
over
an
hour
they
rounded
the
grove
of
trees
at
first
it
seemed
there
was
nothing
before
them
but
the
empty
grassy
glade
then
they
saw
it
lying
on
the
ground
no
more
than
twenty
feet
in
front
of
them
it
was
it
had
been
a
man
he
was
broken
and
stamped
into
hideous
shapelessness
and
something
had
torn
off
his
arms
for
a
moment
there
was
dead
silence
then
the
hunter
whispered
what
did
that
the
answer
came
in
a
savage
squealing
scream
and
the
pound
of
cloven
hooves
a
formless
shadow
beside
the
trees
materialized
into
a
monstrous
charging
bulk
a
thing
like
a
gigantic
gray
bull
eight
feet
tall
at
the
shoulders
with
the
tusked
snarling
head
of
a
boar
and
the
starlight
glinting
along
the
curving
vicious
length
of
its
single
horn
unicorn
prentiss
said
and
jerked
up
his
rifle
the
rifles
cracked
in
a
ragged
volley
the
unicorn
squealed
in
fury
and
struck
the
hunter
catching
him
on
its
horn
and
hurling
him
thirty
feet
one
of
the
riflemen
went
down
under
the
unicorn
hooves
his
cry
ending
almost
as
soon
as
it
began
the
unicorn
ripped
the
sod
in
deep
furrows
as
it
whirled
back
to
prentiss
and
the
remaining
rifleman
not
turning
in
the
manner
of
beasts
of
earth
but
rearing
and
spinning
on
its
hind
feet
it
towered
above
them
as
it
whirled
the
tip
of
its
horn
fifteen
feet
above
the
ground
and
its
hooves
swinging
around
like
great
clubs
prentiss
shot
again
his
sights
on
what
he
hoped
would
be
a
vital
area
and
the
rifleman
shot
an
instant
later
the
shots
went
true
the
unicorn
swing
brought
it
on
around
but
it
collapsed
falling
to
the
ground
with
jarring
heaviness
we
got
it
the
rifleman
said
we
it
half
scrambled
to
its
feet
and
made
a
noise
a
call
that
went
out
through
the
night
like
the
blast
of
a
mighty
trumpet
then
it
dropped
back
to
the
ground
to
die
while
its
call
was
still
echoing
from
the
nearer
hills
from
the
east
came
an
answering
trumpet
blast
a
trumpeting
that
was
sounded
again
from
the
south
and
from
the
north
then
there
came
a
low
and
muffled
drumming
like
the
pounding
of
thousands
of
hooves
the
rifleman
face
was
in
the
starlight
the
others
are
coming
we
have
to
run
for
it
he
turned
and
began
to
run
toward
the
distant
bulk
of
the
stockade
no
prentiss
commanded
quick
and
harsh
not
the
stockade
the
rifleman
kept
running
seeming
not
to
hear
him
in
his
panic
prentiss
called
to
him
once
more
not
the
stockade
lead
the
unicorns
into
it
again
the
rifleman
seemed
not
to
hear
him
the
unicorns
were
coming
in
sight
converging
in
from
the
north
and
east
and
south
the
rumble
of
their
hooves
swelling
to
a
thunder
that
filled
the
night
the
rifleman
would
reach
the
stockade
only
a
little
ahead
of
them
and
they
would
go
through
the
wall
as
though
it
had
been
made
of
paper
for
a
little
while
the
area
inside
the
stockade
would
be
filled
with
dust
with
the
squealing
of
the
swirling
charging
unicorns
and
the
screams
of
the
dying
those
inside
the
stockade
would
have
no
chance
whatever
of
escaping
within
two
minutes
it
would
be
over
the
last
child
would
have
been
found
among
the
shattered
shelters
and
trampled
into
lifeless
shapelessness
in
the
bloody
ground
within
two
minutes
all
human
life
on
ragnarok
would
be
gone
there
was
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
he
dropped
to
one
knee
so
his
aim
would
be
steady
and
the
sights
of
his
rifle
caught
the
running
man
back
he
pressed
the
trigger
and
the
rifle
cracked
viciously
as
it
bucked
against
his
shoulder
the
man
spun
and
fell
hard
to
the
ground
he
twisted
to
raise
himself
up
a
little
and
look
back
his
face
white
and
accusing
and
unbelieving
you
shot
me
then
he
fell
forward
and
lay
without
moving
prentiss
turned
back
to
face
the
unicorns
and
to
look
at
the
trees
in
the
nearby
grove
he
saw
what
he
already
knew
they
were
young
trees
and
too
small
to
offer
any
escape
for
him
there
was
no
place
to
run
no
place
to
hide
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
wait
nothing
he
could
do
but
stand
in
the
blue
starlight
and
watch
the
devil
herd
pound
toward
him
and
think
in
the
last
moments
of
his
life
how
swiftly
and
unexpectedly
death
could
come
to
man
on
ragnarok
the
unicorns
held
the
rejects
prisoners
in
their
stockade
the
rest
of
the
night
and
all
the
next
day
lake
had
seen
the
shooting
of
the
rifleman
and
had
watched
the
unicorn
herd
kill
john
prentiss
and
then
trample
the
dead
rifleman
he
had
already
given
the
order
to
build
a
quick
series
of
fires
around
the
inside
of
the
stockade
walls
when
the
unicorns
paused
to
tear
their
victims
to
pieces
grunting
and
squealing
in
triumph
as
bones
crushed
between
their
teeth
and
they
flung
the
pieces
to
one
side
the
fires
were
started
and
green
wood
was
thrown
on
them
to
make
them
smoulder
and
smoke
for
as
long
as
possible
then
the
unicorns
were
coming
on
to
the
stockade
and
every
person
inside
it
went
into
the
concealment
of
the
shelters
lake
had
already
given
his
last
order
there
would
be
absolute
quiet
until
and
if
the
unicorns
left
a
quiet
that
would
be
enforced
with
fist
or
club
wherever
necessary
the
unicorns
were
still
outside
when
morning
came
the
fires
could
not
be
refueled
the
sight
of
a
man
moving
inside
the
stockade
would
bring
the
entire
herd
charging
through
the
hours
dragged
by
the
smoke
from
the
dying
fires
dwindled
to
thin
streamers
the
unicorns
grew
increasingly
bolder
and
suspicious
crowding
closer
to
the
walls
and
peering
through
the
openings
between
the
rails
the
sun
was
setting
when
one
of
the
unicorns
trumpeted
a
sound
different
from
that
of
the
call
to
battle
the
others
threw
up
their
heads
to
listen
then
they
turned
and
drifted
away
within
minutes
the
entire
herd
was
gone
out
of
sight
through
the
woods
toward
the
north
lake
waited
and
watched
until
he
was
sure
the
unicorns
were
gone
for
good
then
he
ordered
the
all
clear
given
and
hurried
to
the
south
wall
to
look
down
across
the
barren
valley
and
hope
he
would
not
see
what
he
expected
to
see
barber
came
up
behind
him
to
sigh
with
relief
that
was
close
hard
to
make
so
many
people
stay
absolutely
quiet
for
hour
after
hour
especially
the
children
they
do
understand
we
have
to
leave
lake
said
leave
barber
asked
we
can
make
this
stockade
strong
enough
to
hold
out
unicorns
look
to
the
south
lake
told
him
barber
did
so
and
saw
what
lake
had
already
seen
a
broad
low
cloud
of
dust
moving
slowly
toward
them
another
herd
of
unicorns
lake
said
john
did
know
they
migrated
the
dunbar
expedition
was
here
long
enough
to
learn
that
there
be
herd
after
herd
coming
through
and
no
time
for
us
to
strengthen
the
walls
we
have
to
leave
tonight
preparations
were
made
for
the
departure
preparations
that
consisted
mainly
of
providing
each
person
with
as
much
in
the
way
of
food
or
supplies
as
he
or
she
could
carry
in
the
gravity
that
was
not
much
they
left
when
the
blue
star
rose
they
filed
out
through
the
northern
gate
and
the
rear
guard
closed
it
behind
them
there
was
almost
no
conversation
among
them
some
of
them
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
what
had
been
the
only
home
they
had
ever
known
on
ragnarok
then
they
all
faced
forward
again
to
the
northwest
where
the
foothills
of
the
plateau
might
offer
them
sanctuary
they
found
their
sanctuary
on
the
second
day
a
limestone
ridge
with
caves
men
were
sent
back
at
once
to
carry
the
food
and
supplies
left
in
the
stockade
to
the
new
home
they
returned
to
report
that
the
second
herd
of
unicorns
had
broken
down
the
walls
and
ripped
the
interior
of
the
stockade
into
wreckage
much
of
the
food
and
supplies
had
been
totally
destroyed
lake
sent
them
back
twice
more
to
bring
everything
down
to
the
last
piece
of
bent
metal
or
torn
cloth
they
would
find
uses
for
all
of
it
in
the
future
the
cave
system
was
extensive
containing
room
for
several
times
their
number
the
deeper
portions
of
the
caves
could
not
be
lived
in
until
ventilation
ducts
were
made
but
the
outer
caves
were
more
than
sufficient
in
number
work
was
begun
to
clear
them
of
fallen
rubble
to
pry
down
all
loose
material
overhead
and
to
level
the
floors
a
spring
came
out
of
the
ridge
not
far
from
the
caves
and
the
approach
to
the
caves
was
so
narrow
and
steep
that
unicorns
could
scramble
up
it
only
with
difficulty
and
one
at
a
time
and
should
they
ever
reach
the
natural
terrace
in
front
of
the
caves
they
would
be
too
large
to
enter
and
could
do
no
more
than
stand
outside
and
make
targets
of
themselves
for
the
bowmen
within
anders
was
in
charge
of
making
the
caves
livable
his
working
force
restricted
almost
entirely
to
women
and
children
lake
sent
barber
out
with
a
small
detachment
of
men
to
observe
the
woods
goats
and
learn
what
plants
they
ate
and
then
learn
by
experimenting
if
such
plants
could
be
safely
eaten
by
humans
the
need
for
salt
would
be
tremendously
increased
when
summer
came
having
once
experienced
a
saltless
two
weeks
in
the
desert
lake
doubted
that
any
of
them
could
survive
without
it
all
hunting
parties
as
well
as
barber
party
were
ordered
to
investigate
all
deposits
that
might
contain
salt
as
well
as
any
stream
or
pond
that
was
white
along
the
banks
the
hunting
parties
were
of
paramount
importance
and
they
were
kept
out
to
the
limits
of
their
endurance
every
man
physically
able
to
do
so
accompanied
them
those
who
could
not
kill
game
could
carry
it
back
to
the
caves
there
was
no
time
to
spare
already
the
unicorns
were
decreasing
in
numbers
and
the
woods
goats
were
ranging
farther
and
farther
north
at
the
end
of
twenty
days
lake
went
in
search
of
barber
and
his
party
worried
about
them
their
mission
was
one
that
could
be
as
dangerous
as
any
hunting
trip
there
was
no
proof
that
humans
and
ragnarok
creatures
were
so
similar
as
to
guarantee
that
food
for
one
might
not
be
poison
for
the
other
it
was
a
very
necessary
mission
however
dried
meat
alone
would
bring
grave
deficiency
diseases
during
the
summer
which
dried
herbs
and
fruits
would
help
prevent
when
he
located
barber
party
he
found
barber
lying
under
a
tree
pale
and
weak
from
his
latest
experiment
but
recovering
i
was
the
guinea
pig
yesterday
barber
said
some
little
purple
berries
that
the
woods
goats
nibble
at
sometimes
maybe
to
get
a
touch
of
some
certain
vitamin
or
something
i
ate
too
many
i
guess
because
they
hit
my
heart
like
the
kick
of
a
mule
did
you
find
anything
at
all
encouraging
lake
asked
we
found
four
different
herbs
that
are
the
most
violent
cathartics
you
ever
dreamed
of
and
a
little
silvery
fern
that
tastes
like
vanilla
flavored
candy
and
paralyzes
you
stiff
as
a
board
on
the
third
swallow
it
an
hour
before
you
come
back
out
of
it
but
on
the
good
side
we
found
three
different
kinds
of
herbs
that
seem
to
be
all
right
we
been
digging
them
up
and
hanging
them
in
the
trees
to
dry
lake
tried
the
edible
herbs
and
found
them
to
be
something
like
spinach
in
taste
there
was
a
chance
they
might
contain
the
vitamins
and
minerals
needed
since
the
hunting
parties
were
living
exclusively
on
meat
he
would
have
to
point
out
the
edible
herbs
to
all
of
them
so
they
would
know
what
to
eat
should
any
of
them
feel
the
effects
of
diet
deficiency
he
traveled
alone
as
he
visited
the
various
hunting
parties
finding
such
travel
to
be
safer
each
day
as
the
dwindling
of
the
unicorns
neared
the
vanishing
point
it
was
a
safety
he
did
not
welcome
it
meant
the
last
of
the
game
would
be
gone
north
long
before
sufficient
meat
was
taken
none
of
the
hunting
parties
could
report
good
luck
the
woods
goats
swift
and
elusive
at
best
were
vanishing
with
the
unicorns
the
last
cartridge
had
been
fired
and
the
bowmen
while
improving
all
the
time
were
far
from
expert
the
unicorns
which
should
have
been
their
major
source
of
meat
were
invulnerable
to
arrows
unless
shot
at
short
range
in
the
side
of
the
neck
just
behind
the
head
and
at
short
range
the
unicorns
invariably
charged
and
presented
no
such
target
he
made
the
long
hard
climb
up
the
plateau
southern
face
to
stand
at
last
on
top
it
was
treeless
a
flat
green
table
that
stretched
to
the
north
for
as
far
as
he
could
see
a
mountain
range
still
capped
with
snow
lay
perhaps
a
hundred
miles
to
the
northwest
in
the
distance
it
looked
like
a
white
cloud
on
the
horizon
no
other
mountains
or
hills
marred
the
endless
sweep
of
the
high
plain
the
grass
was
thick
and
here
and
there
were
little
streams
of
water
produced
by
the
recently
melted
snow
it
was
a
paradise
land
for
the
herbivores
of
ragnarok
but
for
men
it
was
a
harsh
forbidding
place
at
that
elevation
the
air
was
so
thin
that
only
a
moderate
amount
of
exertion
made
the
heart
and
lungs
labor
painfully
hard
and
prolonged
exertion
would
be
impossible
it
seemed
unlikely
that
men
could
hunt
and
dare
unicorn
attacks
at
such
an
elevation
but
two
hunting
parties
were
ahead
of
him
one
under
the
grim
craig
and
one
under
the
reckless
schroeder
both
parties
stripped
down
to
the
youngest
strongest
men
among
all
the
rejects
he
found
schroeder
early
one
morning
leading
his
hunters
toward
a
small
band
of
woods
goats
two
unicorns
were
grazing
in
between
and
the
hunters
were
swinging
downwind
from
them
schroeder
saw
him
coming
and
walked
back
a
little
way
to
meet
him
welcome
to
our
breathtaking
land
schroeder
greeted
him
how
are
things
going
with
the
rest
of
the
hunting
parties
schroeder
was
gaunt
and
there
was
weariness
beneath
his
still
lithe
movements
his
whiskers
were
an
untamed
sorrel
bristling
and
across
his
cheekbone
was
the
ugly
scar
of
a
half
healed
wound
another
gash
was
ripped
in
his
arm
and
something
had
battered
one
ear
he
reminded
lake
of
a
indomitable
tomcat
who
would
never
for
as
long
as
he
lived
want
to
relinquish
the
joy
of
conflict
and
danger
so
far
he
answered
you
and
craig
are
the
only
parties
to
manage
to
tackle
the
plateau
he
asked
about
schroeder
luck
and
learned
it
had
been
much
better
than
that
of
the
others
due
to
killing
three
unicorns
by
a
method
schroeder
had
thought
of
since
the
bowmen
have
to
be
to
one
side
of
the
unicorns
to
kill
them
schroeder
said
it
only
calls
for
a
man
to
be
the
decoy
and
let
the
unicorns
chase
him
between
the
hidden
bowmen
if
there
no
more
than
one
or
two
unicorns
and
if
the
decoy
does
have
to
run
very
far
and
if
the
bowmen
do
miss
it
works
well
judging
from
your
condition
lake
said
you
must
have
been
the
decoy
every
time
well
schroeder
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
my
idea
i
been
wondering
about
another
way
to
get
in
shots
at
close
range
lake
said
take
the
skin
of
a
woods
goat
give
it
the
original
shape
as
near
as
possible
and
a
bowman
inside
it
might
be
able
to
fake
a
grazing
woods
goat
until
he
got
the
shot
he
wanted
the
unicorns
might
never
suspect
where
the
arrows
came
from
he
concluded
and
then
of
course
they
might
i
try
it
before
the
day
is
over
on
those
two
unicorns
over
there
schroeder
said
at
this
elevation
and
in
this
gravity
my
own
method
is
just
a
little
bit
rough
on
a
man
lake
found
craig
and
his
men
several
miles
to
the
west
all
of
them
gaunt
and
bearded
as
schroeder
had
been
we
had
hell
craig
said
it
seems
that
every
time
we
spot
a
few
woods
goats
there
will
be
a
dozen
unicorns
in
between
if
only
we
had
rifles
for
the
unicorns
lake
told
him
of
the
plan
to
hide
under
woods
goats
skins
and
of
the
decoy
system
used
by
schroeder
maybe
we
wo
have
to
use
schroeder
method
he
said
we
see
if
the
other
works
i
give
it
the
first
try
this
he
was
not
to
do
less
than
an
hour
later
one
of
the
men
who
helped
dry
the
meat
and
carry
it
to
the
caves
returned
to
report
the
camp
stricken
by
a
strange
sudden
malady
that
was
killing
a
hundred
a
day
chiara
who
had
collapsed
while
driving
himself
on
to
care
for
the
sick
was
sure
it
was
a
deficiency
disease
anders
was
down
with
it
helpless
and
bemmon
had
assumed
command
setting
up
daily
work
quotas
for
those
still
on
their
feet
and
refusing
to
heed
chiara
requests
concerning
treatment
of
the
disease
lake
made
the
trip
back
to
the
caves
in
a
fraction
of
the
length
of
time
it
had
taken
him
to
reach
the
plateau
walking
until
he
was
ready
to
drop
and
then
pausing
only
for
an
hour
or
two
of
rest
he
spotted
barber
camp
when
coming
down
off
the
plateau
and
he
swung
to
one
side
to
tell
barber
to
have
a
supply
of
the
herbs
sent
to
the
caves
at
once
he
reached
the
caves
to
find
half
the
camp
in
bed
and
the
other
half
dragging
about
listlessly
at
the
tasks
given
them
by
bemmon
anders
was
in
grave
condition
too
weak
to
rise
and
chiara
was
dying
he
squatted
down
beside
chiara
pallet
and
knew
there
could
be
no
hope
for
him
on
chiara
pale
face
and
in
his
eyes
was
the
shadow
of
his
own
foreknowledge
i
finally
saw
what
it
was
chiara
words
were
very
low
hard
to
hear
and
i
told
bemmon
what
to
do
it
a
deficiency
disease
complicated
by
the
gravity
into
some
form
not
known
on
earth
he
stopped
to
rest
and
lake
waited
pellagra
we
had
deficiency
diseases
on
earth
but
none
so
fatal
so
quickly
i
told
bemmon
ration
out
fruits
and
vegetables
to
everybody
hurry
or
it
will
be
too
late
again
he
stopped
to
rest
the
last
vestige
of
color
gone
from
his
face
and
you
lake
asked
already
knowing
the
answer
for
me
too
late
i
kept
thinking
of
viruses
should
have
seen
the
obvious
sooner
just
like
his
lips
turned
up
a
little
at
the
corners
and
the
chiara
of
the
dead
past
smiled
for
the
last
time
at
lake
just
like
a
damned
fool
intern
that
was
all
then
and
the
chamber
was
suddenly
very
quiet
lake
stood
up
to
leave
and
to
speak
the
words
that
chiara
could
never
hear
we
going
to
need
you
and
miss
you
doctor
he
found
bemmon
in
the
food
storage
cavern
supervising
the
work
of
two
boys
with
critical
officiousness
although
he
was
making
no
move
to
help
them
at
sight
of
lake
he
hurried
forward
the
ingratiating
smile
sliding
across
his
face
i
glad
you
back
he
said
i
had
to
take
charge
when
anders
got
sick
and
he
had
everything
in
such
a
mess
i
been
working
day
and
night
to
undo
his
mistakes
and
get
the
work
properly
under
way
again
lake
looked
at
the
two
boys
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
rest
they
leaned
wearily
against
the
heavy
pole
table
bemmon
had
had
them
moving
their
eyes
already
dull
with
the
incipient
sickness
and
watching
him
in
mute
appeal
have
you
obeyed
chiara
order
he
asked
ah
no
bemmon
said
i
felt
it
best
to
ignore
it
why
lake
asked
it
would
be
a
senseless
waste
of
our
small
supply
of
fruit
and
vegetable
foods
to
give
them
to
people
already
dying
i
afraid
the
ingratiating
smile
came
again
we
been
letting
him
exercise
an
authority
he
is
entitled
to
he
really
hardly
more
than
a
medical
student
and
his
diagnoses
are
only
guesses
he
dead
lake
said
flatly
his
last
order
will
be
carried
out
he
looked
from
the
two
tired
boys
to
bemmon
contrasting
their
thinness
and
weariness
with
the
way
bemmon
paunch
still
bulged
outward
and
his
jowls
still
sagged
with
their
load
of
fat
i
send
west
down
to
take
over
in
here
he
said
to
bemmon
you
come
with
me
you
and
i
seem
to
be
the
only
two
in
good
health
here
and
there
plenty
of
work
for
us
to
do
the
fawning
expression
vanished
from
bemmon
face
i
see
he
said
now
that
i
turned
anders
muddle
into
organization
you
hand
my
authority
over
to
another
of
your
favorites
and
demote
me
back
to
common
labor
setting
up
work
quotas
for
sick
and
dying
people
is
organization
lake
said
he
spoke
to
the
two
boys
both
of
you
go
lie
down
west
will
find
someone
else
then
to
bemmon
come
with
me
we
both
going
to
work
at
common
labor
they
passed
by
the
cave
where
bemmon
slept
two
boys
were
just
going
into
it
carrying
armloads
of
dried
grass
to
make
a
mattress
under
bemmon
pallet
they
moved
slowly
heavily
like
the
two
boys
in
the
food
storage
cave
they
were
with
the
beginning
of
the
sickness
lake
stopped
to
look
more
closely
into
the
cave
and
verify
something
else
he
thought
he
had
seen
bemmon
had
discarded
the
prowler
skins
on
his
bed
and
in
their
place
were
soft
wool
blankets
perhaps
the
only
unpatched
blankets
the
rejects
possessed
go
back
to
your
caves
he
said
to
the
boys
go
to
bed
and
rest
he
looked
at
bemmon
bemmon
eyes
flickered
away
refusing
to
meet
his
what
few
blankets
we
have
are
for
babies
and
the
very
youngest
children
he
said
his
tone
was
coldly
unemotional
but
he
could
not
keep
his
fists
from
clenching
at
his
sides
you
will
return
them
at
once
and
sleep
on
animal
skins
as
all
the
men
and
women
do
and
if
you
want
grass
for
a
mattress
you
will
carry
it
yourself
as
even
the
young
children
do
bemmon
made
no
answer
his
face
a
sullen
red
and
hatred
shining
in
the
eyes
that
still
refused
to
meet
lake
gather
up
the
blankets
and
return
them
lake
said
then
come
on
up
to
the
central
cave
we
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
he
could
feel
bemmon
gaze
burning
against
his
back
as
he
turned
away
and
he
thought
of
what
john
prentiss
had
once
said
i
know
he
no
good
but
he
never
has
guts
enough
to
go
quite
far
enough
to
give
me
an
excuse
to
whittle
him
down
barber
men
arrived
the
next
day
burdened
with
dried
herbs
these
were
given
to
the
seriously
ill
as
a
supplement
to
the
ration
of
fruit
and
vegetable
foods
and
were
given
alone
to
those
not
yet
sick
then
came
the
period
of
waiting
of
hoping
that
it
was
all
not
too
late
and
too
little
a
noticeable
change
for
the
better
began
on
the
second
day
a
week
went
by
and
the
sick
were
slowly
steadily
improving
the
were
already
back
to
normal
health
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
the
ragnarok
herbs
would
prevent
a
recurrence
of
the
disease
it
was
lake
thought
all
so
simple
once
you
knew
what
to
do
hundreds
had
died
chiara
among
them
because
they
did
not
have
a
common
herb
that
grew
at
a
slightly
higher
elevation
not
a
single
life
would
have
been
lost
if
he
could
have
looked
a
week
into
the
future
and
had
the
herbs
found
and
taken
to
the
caves
that
much
sooner
but
the
disease
had
given
no
warning
of
its
coming
nothing
on
ragnarok
ever
seemed
to
give
warning
before
it
killed
another
week
went
by
and
hunters
began
to
trickle
in
gaunt
and
exhausted
to
report
all
the
game
going
north
up
the
plateau
and
not
a
single
creature
left
below
they
were
the
ones
who
had
tried
and
failed
to
withstand
the
high
elevation
of
the
plateau
only
two
out
of
three
hunters
returned
among
those
who
had
challenged
the
plateau
they
had
tried
all
of
them
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
the
limits
of
their
endurance
the
blue
star
was
by
then
a
small
sun
and
the
yellow
sun
blazed
hotter
each
day
grass
began
to
brown
and
wither
on
the
hillsides
as
the
days
went
by
and
lake
knew
summer
was
very
near
the
last
hunting
party
but
for
craig
and
schroeder
returned
they
had
very
little
meat
but
they
brought
with
them
a
large
quantity
of
something
almost
as
important
salt
they
had
found
a
deposit
of
it
in
an
almost
inaccessible
region
of
cliffs
and
canyons
not
even
the
woods
goats
can
get
in
there
stevens
the
leader
of
that
party
said
if
the
salt
was
in
an
accessible
place
there
would
have
been
a
salt
lick
there
and
goats
in
plenty
if
woods
goats
care
for
salt
the
way
earth
animals
do
lake
said
when
fall
comes
we
make
a
salt
lick
and
find
out
two
more
weeks
went
by
and
craig
and
schroeder
returned
with
their
surviving
hunters
they
had
followed
the
game
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
mountain
range
but
there
the
migration
had
drawn
away
from
them
traveling
farther
each
day
than
they
could
travel
they
had
almost
waited
too
long
before
turning
back
the
grass
at
the
southern
end
of
the
plateau
was
turning
brown
and
the
streams
were
dry
they
got
enough
water
barely
by
digging
seep
holes
in
the
dry
stream
beds
lake
method
of
stalking
unicorns
under
the
concealment
of
a
woods
goat
skin
had
worked
well
only
a
few
times
after
that
the
unicorns
learned
to
swing
downwind
from
any
lone
woods
goats
if
they
smelled
a
man
inside
the
goat
skin
they
charged
him
and
killed
him
with
the
return
of
the
last
hunters
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
in
preparation
for
summer
inventory
was
taken
of
the
total
food
supply
and
it
was
even
smaller
than
lake
had
feared
it
would
be
far
from
enough
to
last
until
fall
brought
the
game
back
from
the
north
and
he
instituted
rationing
much
stricter
than
before
the
heat
increased
as
the
yellow
sun
blazed
hotter
and
the
blue
sun
grew
larger
each
day
the
vegetation
was
browner
and
a
morning
came
when
lake
could
see
no
green
wherever
he
looked
they
numbered
eleven
hundred
and
ten
that
morning
out
of
what
had
so
recently
been
four
thousand
eleven
hundred
and
ten
thin
hungry
scarecrows
who
already
could
do
nothing
more
than
sit
listlessly
in
the
shade
and
wait
for
the
hell
that
was
coming
he
thought
of
the
food
supply
so
pitifully
small
and
of
the
months
it
would
have
to
last
he
saw
the
grim
inescapable
future
for
his
charges
famine
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
to
prevent
it
he
could
only
try
to
forestall
complete
starvation
for
all
by
cutting
rations
to
the
bare
existence
level
and
that
would
be
bare
existence
for
the
stronger
of
them
the
weaker
were
already
doomed
he
had
them
all
gather
in
front
of
the
caves
that
evening
when
the
terrace
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
ridge
he
stood
before
them
and
spoke
to
them
all
of
you
know
we
have
only
a
fraction
of
the
amount
of
food
we
need
to
see
us
through
the
summer
tomorrow
the
present
ration
will
be
cut
in
half
that
will
be
enough
to
live
on
just
barely
if
that
cut
made
the
food
supply
will
be
gone
long
before
fall
and
all
of
us
will
die
if
anyone
has
any
food
of
any
kind
it
must
be
turned
in
to
be
added
to
the
total
supply
some
of
you
may
have
thought
of
your
children
and
kept
a
little
hidden
for
them
i
can
understand
why
you
should
do
that
but
you
must
turn
it
in
there
may
possibly
be
some
who
hid
food
for
themselves
personally
if
so
i
give
them
the
first
and
last
warning
turn
it
in
tonight
if
any
hidden
cache
of
food
is
found
in
the
future
the
one
who
hid
it
will
be
regarded
as
a
traitor
and
murderer
all
of
you
but
for
the
children
will
go
into
the
chamber
next
to
the
one
where
the
food
is
stored
each
of
you
and
there
will
be
no
exceptions
regardless
of
how
innocent
you
are
will
carry
a
bulkily
folded
cloth
or
garment
each
of
you
will
go
into
the
chamber
alone
there
will
be
no
one
in
there
you
will
leave
the
food
you
have
folded
in
the
cloth
if
any
and
go
out
the
other
exit
and
back
to
your
caves
no
one
will
ever
know
whether
the
cloth
you
carried
contained
food
or
not
no
one
will
ever
ask
our
survival
on
this
world
if
we
are
to
survive
at
all
can
be
only
by
working
and
sacrificing
together
there
can
be
no
selfishness
what
any
of
you
may
have
done
in
the
past
is
of
no
consequence
tonight
we
start
anew
from
now
on
we
trust
one
another
without
reserve
there
will
be
one
punishment
for
any
who
betray
that
trust
death
anders
set
the
example
by
being
the
first
to
carry
a
folded
cloth
into
the
cave
of
them
all
lake
heard
later
only
bemmon
voiced
any
real
indignation
warning
all
those
in
his
section
of
the
line
that
the
order
was
the
first
step
toward
outright
dictatorship
and
a
system
in
which
lake
and
the
other
leaders
would
deprive
them
all
of
freedom
and
dignity
bemmon
insisted
upon
exhibiting
the
emptiness
of
the
cloth
he
carried
an
action
that
had
he
succeeded
in
persuading
the
others
to
follow
his
example
would
have
mercilessly
exposed
those
who
did
have
food
they
were
returning
but
no
one
followed
bemmon
example
and
no
harm
was
done
as
for
lake
he
had
worries
on
his
mind
of
much
greater
importance
than
enmity
the
weeks
dragged
by
each
longer
and
more
terrible
to
endure
than
the
one
before
it
as
the
heat
steadily
increased
summer
solstice
arrived
and
there
was
no
escape
from
the
heat
even
in
the
deepest
caves
there
was
no
night
the
blue
sun
rose
in
the
east
as
the
yellow
sun
set
in
the
west
there
was
no
life
of
any
kind
to
be
seen
not
even
an
insect
nothing
moved
across
the
burned
land
but
the
swirling
dust
devils
and
shimmering
distorted
mirages
the
death
rate
increased
with
appalling
swiftness
the
small
supply
of
canned
and
dehydrated
milk
fruit
and
vegetables
was
reserved
exclusively
for
the
children
but
it
was
far
insufficient
in
quantity
the
ragnarok
herbs
prevented
any
recurrence
of
the
fatal
deficiency
disease
but
they
provided
virtually
no
nourishment
to
help
fight
the
heat
and
gravity
the
stronger
of
the
children
lay
wasted
and
listless
on
their
pallets
while
the
ones
not
so
strong
died
each
day
each
day
thin
and
mothers
would
come
to
plead
with
him
to
save
their
children
it
would
take
so
little
to
save
his
life
please
before
it
too
late
but
there
was
so
little
food
left
and
the
time
was
yet
so
long
until
fall
would
bring
relief
from
the
famine
that
he
could
only
answer
each
of
them
with
a
grim
and
final
no
and
watch
the
last
hope
flicker
and
die
in
their
eyes
and
watch
them
turn
away
to
go
and
sit
for
the
last
hours
beside
their
children
bemmon
became
increasingly
irritable
and
complaining
as
the
rationing
and
heat
made
existence
a
misery
insisting
that
lake
and
the
others
were
to
blame
for
the
food
shortage
that
their
hunting
efforts
had
been
bungling
and
and
he
implied
without
actually
saying
so
that
lake
and
the
others
had
forbidden
him
to
go
near
the
food
chamber
because
they
did
not
want
a
competent
honest
man
to
check
up
on
what
they
were
doing
there
were
six
hundred
and
three
of
them
the
blazing
afternoon
when
the
girl
julia
could
stand
his
constant
vindictive
no
longer
lake
heard
about
it
shortly
afterward
the
way
she
had
turned
on
bemmon
in
a
flare
of
temper
she
could
control
no
longer
and
said
whenever
your
mouth
is
still
you
can
hear
the
children
who
are
dying
today
but
you
do
care
all
you
can
think
of
is
yourself
you
claim
lake
and
the
others
were
cowards
but
you
did
dare
hunt
with
them
you
keep
insinuating
that
they
cheating
us
and
eating
more
than
we
are
but
your
belly
is
the
only
one
that
has
any
fat
left
on
it
she
never
completed
the
sentence
bemmon
face
turned
livid
in
sudden
wild
fury
and
he
struck
her
knocking
her
against
the
rock
wall
so
hard
that
she
slumped
unconscious
to
the
ground
she
a
liar
he
panted
glaring
at
the
others
she
a
rotten
liar
and
anybody
who
repeats
what
she
said
will
get
what
she
got
when
lake
learned
of
what
had
happened
he
did
not
send
for
bemmon
at
once
he
wondered
why
bemmon
reaction
had
been
so
quick
and
violent
and
there
seemed
to
be
only
one
answer
bemmon
belly
was
still
a
little
fat
there
could
be
but
one
way
he
could
have
kept
it
so
he
summoned
craig
schroeder
barber
and
anders
they
went
to
the
chamber
where
bemmon
slept
and
there
almost
at
once
they
found
his
cache
he
had
it
buried
under
his
pallet
and
hidden
in
cavities
along
the
walls
dried
meat
dried
fruits
and
milk
canned
vegetables
it
was
an
amount
amazingly
large
and
many
of
the
items
had
presumably
been
exhausted
during
the
deficiency
disease
attack
it
looks
schroeder
said
like
he
did
waste
any
time
feathering
his
nest
when
he
made
himself
leader
the
others
said
nothing
but
stood
with
grim
frozen
faces
waiting
for
lake
next
action
bring
bemmon
lake
said
to
craig
craig
returned
with
him
two
minutes
later
bemmon
stiffened
at
the
sight
of
his
unearthed
cache
and
color
drained
away
from
his
face
well
lake
asked
i
did
bemmon
swallowed
i
did
know
it
was
there
and
then
quickly
you
ca
prove
i
put
it
there
you
ca
prove
you
just
now
bring
it
in
yourselves
to
frame
me
lake
stared
at
bemmon
waiting
the
others
watched
bemmon
as
lake
was
doing
and
no
one
spoke
the
silence
deepened
and
bemmon
began
to
sweat
as
he
tried
to
avoid
their
eyes
he
looked
again
at
the
damning
evidence
and
his
defiance
broke
it
if
i
had
taken
it
it
would
have
been
wasted
on
people
who
were
dying
he
said
he
wiped
at
his
sweating
face
i
wo
ever
do
it
again
i
swear
i
wo
lake
spoke
to
craig
you
and
barber
take
him
to
the
lookout
point
what
bemmon
protest
was
cut
off
as
craig
and
barber
took
him
by
the
arms
and
walked
him
swiftly
away
lake
turned
to
anders
get
a
rope
he
ordered
anders
paled
a
little
a
rope
what
else
does
he
deserve
nothing
anders
said
not
not
after
what
he
did
on
the
way
out
they
passed
the
place
where
julia
lay
bemmon
had
knocked
her
against
the
wall
with
such
force
that
a
sharp
projection
of
rock
had
cut
a
deep
gash
in
her
forehead
a
woman
was
wiping
the
blood
from
her
face
and
she
lay
limply
still
unconscious
a
frail
shadow
of
the
bold
girl
she
had
once
been
with
the
new
life
she
would
try
to
give
them
an
almost
unnoticeable
little
bulge
in
her
starved
thinness
the
lookout
point
was
an
outjutting
spur
of
the
ridge
six
hundred
feet
from
the
caves
and
in
full
view
of
them
a
lone
tree
stood
there
its
dead
limbs
thrust
like
white
arms
through
the
brown
foliage
of
the
limbs
that
still
lived
craig
and
barber
waited
under
the
tree
bemmon
between
them
the
lowering
sun
shone
hot
and
bright
on
bemmon
face
as
he
squinted
back
toward
the
caves
at
the
approach
of
lake
and
the
other
two
he
twisted
to
look
at
barber
what
is
it
why
did
you
bring
me
here
there
was
the
tremor
of
fear
in
his
voice
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
barber
did
not
answer
and
bemmon
turned
back
toward
lake
he
saw
the
rope
in
anders
hand
and
his
face
went
white
with
comprehension
no
he
threw
himself
back
with
a
violence
that
almost
tore
him
loose
no
no
schroeder
stepped
forward
to
help
hold
him
and
lake
took
the
rope
from
anders
he
fashioned
a
noose
in
it
while
bemmon
struggled
and
made
panting
animal
sounds
his
eyes
fixed
in
horrified
fascination
on
the
rope
when
the
noose
was
finished
he
threw
the
free
end
of
the
rope
over
the
white
limb
above
bemmon
he
released
the
noose
and
barber
caught
it
to
draw
it
snug
around
bemmon
neck
bemmon
stopped
struggling
then
and
sagged
weakly
for
a
moment
it
appeared
that
he
would
faint
then
he
worked
his
mouth
soundlessly
until
words
came
you
wo
you
ca
really
hang
me
lake
spoke
to
him
we
going
to
hang
you
what
you
stole
would
have
saved
the
lives
of
ten
children
you
watched
the
children
cry
because
they
were
so
hungry
and
you
watched
them
become
too
weak
to
cry
or
care
any
more
you
watched
them
die
each
day
and
each
night
you
secretly
eaten
the
food
that
was
supposed
to
be
theirs
we
going
to
hang
you
for
the
murder
of
children
and
the
betrayal
of
our
trust
in
you
if
you
have
anything
to
say
say
it
now
you
ca
i
had
a
right
to
live
to
eat
what
would
have
been
wasted
on
dying
people
bemmon
twisted
to
appeal
to
the
ones
who
held
him
his
words
quick
and
ragged
with
hysteria
you
ca
hang
me
i
do
want
to
die
craig
answered
him
with
a
smile
that
was
like
the
thin
snarl
of
a
wolf
neither
did
two
of
my
children
lake
nodded
to
craig
and
schroeder
not
waiting
any
longer
they
stepped
back
to
seize
the
free
end
of
the
rope
and
bemmon
screamed
at
what
was
coming
tearing
loose
from
the
grip
of
barber
then
his
scream
was
abruptly
cut
off
as
he
was
jerked
into
the
air
there
was
a
cracking
sound
and
he
kicked
spasmodically
his
head
setting
grotesquely
to
one
side
craig
and
schroeder
and
barber
watched
him
with
hard
expressionless
faces
but
anders
turned
quickly
away
to
be
suddenly
and
violently
sick
he
was
the
first
to
betray
us
lake
said
snub
the
rope
and
leave
him
to
swing
there
if
there
are
any
others
like
him
they
know
what
to
expect
the
blue
sun
rose
as
they
went
back
to
the
caves
behind
them
bemmon
swung
and
twirled
aimlessly
on
the
end
of
the
rope
two
long
pale
shadows
swung
and
twirled
with
him
a
yellow
one
to
the
west
and
a
blue
one
to
the
east
bemmon
was
buried
the
next
day
someone
cursed
his
name
and
someone
spit
on
his
grave
and
then
he
was
part
of
the
dead
past
as
they
faced
the
suffering
ahead
of
them
julia
recovered
although
she
would
always
wear
a
ragged
scar
on
her
forehead
anders
who
had
worked
closely
with
chiara
and
was
trying
to
take
his
place
quieted
her
fears
by
assuring
her
that
the
baby
she
carried
was
still
too
small
for
there
to
be
much
danger
of
the
fall
causing
her
to
lose
it
three
times
during
the
next
month
the
wind
came
roaring
down
out
of
the
northwest
bringing
a
gray
dust
that
filled
the
sky
and
enveloped
the
land
in
a
hot
smothering
gloom
through
which
the
suns
could
not
be
seen
once
black
clouds
gathered
in
the
distance
to
pour
out
a
cloudburst
the
gravity
gave
the
wall
of
water
that
swept
down
the
canyon
a
far
greater
force
and
velocity
than
it
would
have
had
on
earth
and
boulders
the
size
of
small
houses
were
tossed
into
the
air
and
shattered
into
fragments
but
all
the
rain
fell
upon
the
one
small
area
and
not
a
drop
fell
at
the
caves
one
single
factor
was
in
their
favor
and
but
for
it
they
could
not
have
survived
such
intense
continual
heat
there
was
no
humidity
water
evaporated
quickly
in
the
hot
dry
air
and
sweat
glands
operated
at
the
highest
possible
degree
of
efficiency
as
a
result
they
drank
enormous
quantities
of
water
the
average
adult
needed
five
gallons
a
day
all
canvas
had
been
converted
into
water
bags
and
the
same
principle
of
gave
them
water
that
was
only
warm
instead
of
sickeningly
hot
as
it
would
otherwise
have
been
but
despite
the
lack
of
humidity
the
heat
was
still
far
more
intense
than
any
on
earth
it
never
ceased
day
or
night
never
let
them
have
a
moment
relief
there
was
a
limit
to
how
long
human
flesh
could
bear
up
under
it
no
matter
how
valiant
the
will
each
day
the
toll
of
those
who
had
reached
that
limit
was
greater
like
a
swiftly
rising
tide
there
were
three
hundred
and
forty
of
them
when
the
first
rain
came
the
rain
that
meant
the
end
of
summer
the
yellow
sun
moved
southward
and
the
blue
sun
shrank
steadily
grass
grew
again
and
the
woods
goats
returned
with
them
the
young
that
had
been
born
in
the
north
already
half
the
size
of
their
mothers
for
a
while
there
was
meat
and
green
herbs
then
the
prowlers
came
to
make
hunting
dangerous
females
with
pups
were
seen
but
always
at
a
great
distance
as
though
the
prowlers
like
humans
took
no
chances
with
the
lives
of
their
children
the
unicorns
came
close
behind
the
first
prowlers
their
young
amazingly
large
and
already
weaned
hunting
became
doubly
dangerous
then
but
the
bowmen
through
necessity
were
learning
how
to
use
their
bows
with
increasing
skill
and
deadliness
a
salt
lick
for
the
woods
goats
was
hopefully
tried
although
lake
felt
dubious
about
it
they
learned
that
salt
was
something
the
woods
goats
could
either
take
or
leave
alone
and
when
hunters
were
in
the
vicinity
they
left
it
alone
the
game
was
followed
for
many
miles
to
the
south
the
hunters
returned
the
day
the
first
blizzard
came
roaring
and
screaming
down
over
the
edge
of
the
plateau
the
blizzard
that
marked
the
beginning
of
the
long
frigid
winter
by
then
they
were
prepared
as
best
they
could
be
wood
had
been
carried
in
great
quantities
and
the
caves
fitted
with
crude
doors
and
a
ventilation
system
and
they
had
meat
not
as
much
as
they
would
need
but
enough
to
prevent
starvation
lake
took
inventory
of
the
food
supply
when
the
last
hunters
returned
and
held
inventories
at
irregular
and
unannounced
intervals
he
found
no
shortages
he
had
expected
none
bemmon
grave
had
long
since
been
obliterated
by
drifting
snow
but
the
rope
still
hung
from
the
dead
limb
the
noose
swinging
and
turning
in
the
wind
anders
had
made
a
ragnarok
calendar
that
spring
from
data
given
him
by
john
prentiss
and
he
had
marked
the
corresponding
earth
dates
on
it
by
a
coincidence
christmas
came
near
the
middle
of
the
winter
there
would
be
the
same
rationing
of
food
on
christmas
day
but
little
brown
trees
had
been
cut
for
the
children
and
decorated
with
such
ornaments
as
could
be
made
from
the
materials
at
hand
there
was
another
blizzard
roaring
down
off
the
plateau
christmas
morning
a
white
death
that
thundered
and
howled
outside
the
caves
at
a
temperature
of
more
than
eighty
degrees
below
zero
but
inside
the
caves
it
was
warm
by
the
fires
and
under
the
little
brown
trees
were
toys
that
had
been
patiently
whittled
from
wood
or
sewn
from
scraps
of
cloth
and
animal
skins
while
the
children
slept
they
were
crude
and
humble
toys
but
the
pale
thin
faces
of
the
children
were
bright
with
delight
when
they
beheld
them
there
was
the
laughter
of
children
at
play
a
sound
that
had
not
been
heard
for
many
months
and
someone
singing
the
old
old
songs
for
a
few
fleeting
hours
that
day
for
the
first
and
last
time
on
ragnarok
there
was
the
magic
of
an
earth
christmas
that
night
a
child
was
born
to
julia
on
a
pallet
of
dried
grass
and
prowler
skins
she
asked
for
her
baby
before
she
died
and
they
let
her
have
it
i
was
afraid
was
i
she
asked
but
i
wish
it
was
so
dark
i
wish
i
could
see
my
baby
before
i
go
they
took
the
baby
from
her
arms
when
she
was
gone
and
removed
from
it
the
blanket
that
had
kept
her
from
learning
that
her
child
was
there
were
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
when
the
first
violent
storms
of
spring
came
by
then
eighteen
children
had
been
born
sixteen
were
eight
of
them
deformed
by
the
gravity
but
two
were
like
any
normal
babies
on
earth
there
was
only
one
difference
the
gravity
did
not
seem
to
affect
them
as
much
as
it
had
the
babies
lake
himself
married
that
spring
a
tall
girl
who
had
fought
alongside
the
men
the
night
of
the
storm
when
the
prowlers
broke
into
john
prentiss
camp
and
schroeder
married
the
last
of
them
all
to
do
so
that
spring
lake
sent
out
two
classes
of
bowmen
those
who
would
use
the
ordinary
short
bow
and
those
who
would
use
the
longbows
he
had
had
made
that
winter
according
to
history
the
english
longbowmen
of
medieval
times
had
been
without
equal
in
the
range
and
accuracy
of
their
arrows
and
such
weapons
should
eliminate
close
range
stalking
of
woods
goats
and
afford
better
protection
from
unicorns
the
longbows
worked
so
well
that
by
he
could
detach
craig
and
three
others
from
the
hunting
and
send
them
on
a
prospecting
expedition
prentiss
had
said
ragnarok
was
devoid
of
metals
but
there
was
the
hope
of
finding
small
veins
the
dunbar
expedition
instruments
had
not
detected
they
would
have
to
find
metal
or
else
in
the
end
they
would
go
back
into
a
flint
axe
stage
craig
and
his
men
returned
when
the
blue
star
was
a
sun
again
and
the
heat
was
more
than
men
could
walk
and
work
in
they
had
traveled
hundreds
of
miles
in
their
circuit
and
found
no
metals
i
want
to
look
to
the
south
when
fall
comes
craig
said
maybe
it
will
be
different
down
there
they
did
not
face
famine
that
summer
as
they
had
the
first
summer
the
diet
of
meat
and
dried
herbs
was
rough
and
plain
but
there
was
enough
of
it
full
summer
came
and
the
land
was
again
burned
and
lifeless
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
sit
wearily
in
the
shade
and
endure
the
heat
drawing
what
psychological
comfort
they
could
from
the
fact
that
summer
solstice
was
past
and
the
suns
were
creeping
south
again
even
though
it
would
be
many
weeks
before
there
was
any
lessening
of
the
heat
it
was
then
and
by
accident
that
lake
discovered
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
southward
movement
of
the
suns
he
was
returning
from
the
lookout
that
day
and
he
realized
it
was
exactly
a
year
since
he
and
the
others
had
walked
back
to
the
caves
while
bemmon
swung
on
the
limb
behind
them
it
was
even
the
same
time
of
day
the
blue
sun
rising
in
the
east
behind
him
and
the
yellow
sun
bright
in
his
face
as
it
touched
the
western
horizon
before
him
he
remembered
how
the
yellow
sun
had
been
like
the
front
sight
of
a
rifle
set
in
the
deepest
v
notch
of
the
western
hills
but
now
exactly
a
year
later
it
was
not
in
the
v
notch
it
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
notch
he
looked
to
the
east
at
the
blue
sun
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
too
was
farther
north
than
it
had
been
although
with
it
he
had
no
landmark
to
check
by
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
yellow
sun
it
was
going
south
as
it
should
at
that
time
of
year
but
it
was
lagging
behind
schedule
the
only
explanation
lake
could
think
of
was
one
that
would
mean
still
another
threat
to
their
survival
perhaps
greater
than
all
the
others
combined
the
yellow
sun
dropped
completely
behind
the
north
slope
of
the
v
notch
and
he
went
on
to
the
caves
he
found
craig
and
anders
the
only
two
who
might
know
anything
about
ragnarok
axial
tilts
and
told
them
what
he
had
seen
i
made
the
calendar
from
the
data
john
gave
me
anders
said
the
dunbar
men
made
observations
and
computed
the
length
of
year
i
do
think
they
would
have
made
any
mistakes
if
they
did
lake
said
we
in
for
something
craig
was
watching
him
closely
thoughtfully
like
the
ice
ages
of
earth
he
asked
lake
nodded
and
anders
said
i
do
understand
each
year
the
north
pole
tilts
toward
the
sun
to
give
us
summer
and
away
from
it
to
give
us
winter
lake
said
which
of
course
you
know
but
there
can
be
still
another
kind
of
axial
tilt
on
earth
it
occurs
at
intervals
of
thousands
of
years
the
tilting
that
produces
the
summers
and
winters
goes
on
as
usual
but
as
the
centuries
go
by
the
summer
tilt
toward
the
sun
grows
less
the
winter
tilt
away
from
it
greater
the
north
pole
leans
farther
and
farther
from
the
sun
and
ice
sheets
come
down
out
of
the
north
an
ice
age
then
the
north
progression
away
from
the
sun
stops
and
the
ice
sheets
recede
as
it
tilts
back
toward
the
sun
i
see
anders
said
and
if
the
same
thing
is
happening
here
going
away
from
an
ice
age
but
at
a
rate
thousands
of
times
faster
than
on
earth
i
do
know
whether
it
ragnarok
tilt
alone
or
if
the
orbits
of
the
suns
around
each
other
add
effects
of
their
own
over
a
period
of
years
lake
said
the
dunbar
expedition
was
here
long
enough
to
check
up
on
anything
like
that
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
hotter
this
summer
than
last
craig
said
maybe
only
my
imagination
but
it
wo
be
imagination
in
a
few
years
if
the
tilt
toward
the
sun
continues
the
time
would
come
when
we
have
to
leave
here
lake
said
have
to
go
north
up
the
plateau
each
spring
there
no
timber
there
nothing
but
grass
and
wind
and
thin
air
we
have
to
migrate
south
each
fall
yes
migrate
anders
face
was
old
and
weary
in
the
harsh
reflected
light
of
the
blue
sun
and
his
hair
had
turned
almost
white
in
the
past
year
only
the
young
ones
could
ever
adapt
enough
to
go
up
the
plateau
to
its
north
portion
the
rest
of
us
but
we
have
many
years
anyway
ragnarok
is
for
the
young
and
if
they
have
to
migrate
back
and
forth
like
animals
just
to
stay
alive
they
will
never
have
time
to
accomplish
anything
or
be
more
than
stone
age
nomads
i
wish
we
could
know
how
long
the
big
summer
will
be
that
we
going
into
craig
said
and
how
long
and
cold
the
big
winter
when
ragnarok
tilts
away
from
the
sun
it
would
change
anything
but
i
like
to
know
we
start
making
and
recording
daily
observations
lake
said
maybe
the
tilt
will
start
back
the
other
way
before
it
too
late
fall
seemed
to
come
a
little
later
that
year
craig
went
to
the
south
as
soon
as
the
weather
permitted
but
there
were
no
minerals
there
only
the
hills
dwindling
in
size
until
they
became
a
prairie
that
sloped
down
and
down
toward
the
southern
lowlands
where
all
the
creatures
of
ragnarok
spent
the
winter
i
try
again
to
the
north
when
spring
comes
craig
said
maybe
that
mountain
on
the
plateau
will
have
something
winter
came
and
elaine
died
in
giving
him
a
son
the
loss
of
elaine
was
an
unexpected
blow
hurting
more
than
he
would
ever
have
thought
possible
but
he
had
a
son
and
it
was
his
responsibility
to
do
whatever
he
could
to
insure
the
survival
of
his
son
and
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
all
the
others
his
outlook
altered
and
he
began
to
think
of
the
future
not
in
terms
of
years
to
come
but
in
terms
of
generations
to
come
someday
one
of
the
young
ones
would
succeed
him
as
leader
but
the
young
ones
would
have
only
childhood
memories
of
earth
he
was
the
last
leader
who
had
known
earth
and
the
civilization
of
earth
as
a
grown
man
what
he
did
while
he
was
leader
would
incline
the
destiny
of
a
new
race
he
would
have
to
do
whatever
was
possible
for
him
to
do
and
he
would
have
to
begin
at
once
the
years
left
to
him
could
not
be
many
he
was
not
alone
others
in
the
caves
had
the
same
thoughts
he
had
regarding
the
future
even
though
none
of
them
had
any
plan
for
accomplishing
what
they
spoke
of
west
who
had
held
degrees
in
philosophy
on
earth
said
to
lake
one
night
as
they
sat
together
by
the
fire
have
you
noticed
the
way
the
children
listen
when
the
talk
turns
to
what
used
to
be
on
earth
what
might
have
been
on
athena
and
what
would
be
if
only
we
could
find
a
way
to
escape
from
ragnarok
i
noticed
he
said
these
stories
already
contain
the
goal
for
the
future
generations
west
went
on
someday
somehow
they
will
go
to
athena
to
kill
the
gerns
there
and
free
the
terran
slaves
and
reclaim
athena
as
their
own
he
had
listened
to
them
talk
of
the
interstellar
flight
to
athena
as
they
sat
by
their
fires
and
worked
at
making
bows
and
arrows
it
was
only
a
dream
they
held
yet
without
that
dream
there
would
be
nothing
before
them
but
the
vision
of
generation
after
generation
living
and
dying
on
a
world
that
could
never
give
them
more
than
existence
the
dream
was
needed
but
it
alone
was
not
enough
how
long
on
earth
had
it
been
from
the
neolithic
age
to
advanced
civilization
how
long
from
the
time
men
were
ready
to
leave
their
caves
until
they
were
ready
to
go
to
the
stars
twelve
thousand
years
there
were
men
and
women
among
the
rejects
who
had
been
specialists
in
various
fields
there
were
a
few
books
that
had
survived
the
trampling
of
the
unicorns
and
others
could
be
written
with
ink
made
from
the
black
lance
tree
bark
upon
parchment
made
from
the
thin
inner
skin
of
unicorn
hides
the
knowledge
contained
in
the
books
and
the
learning
of
the
rejects
still
living
should
be
preserved
for
the
future
generations
with
the
help
of
that
learning
perhaps
they
really
could
someday
somehow
escape
from
their
prison
and
make
athena
their
own
he
told
west
of
what
he
had
been
thinking
we
have
to
start
a
school
he
said
this
winter
tomorrow
west
nodded
in
agreement
and
the
writings
should
be
commenced
as
soon
as
possible
some
of
the
textbooks
will
require
more
time
to
write
than
ragnarok
will
give
the
authors
a
school
for
the
children
was
started
the
next
day
and
the
writing
of
the
books
began
the
parchment
books
would
serve
two
purposes
one
would
be
to
teach
the
future
generations
things
that
would
not
only
help
them
survive
but
would
help
them
create
a
culture
of
their
own
as
advanced
as
the
harsh
environment
and
scanty
resources
of
ragnarok
permitted
the
other
would
be
to
warn
them
of
the
danger
of
a
return
of
the
gerns
and
to
teach
them
all
that
was
known
about
gerns
and
their
weapons
lake
main
contribution
would
be
a
lengthy
book
terran
spaceships
types
and
operation
he
postponed
its
writing
however
to
first
produce
a
much
smaller
book
but
one
that
might
well
be
more
important
interior
features
of
a
gern
cruiser
terran
intelligence
knew
a
little
about
gern
cruisers
and
as
of
the
he
had
seen
and
studied
a
copy
of
that
report
he
had
an
excellent
memory
for
such
things
almost
photographic
and
he
wrote
the
text
and
drew
a
multitude
of
sketches
he
shook
his
head
ruefully
at
the
result
the
text
was
good
but
for
clarity
the
accompanying
illustrations
should
be
accurate
and
in
perspective
and
he
was
definitely
not
an
artist
he
discovered
that
craig
could
take
a
pen
in
his
scarred
powerful
hand
and
draw
with
the
neat
precision
of
a
professional
artist
he
turned
the
sketches
over
to
him
together
with
the
mass
of
specifications
since
it
might
someday
be
of
such
vital
importance
he
would
make
four
copies
of
it
the
text
was
given
to
a
girl
who
would
make
three
more
copies
of
it
four
days
later
schroeder
handed
lake
a
text
with
some
rough
sketches
the
title
was
operation
of
gern
blasters
not
even
intelligence
had
ever
been
able
to
examine
a
gern
hand
blaster
but
a
man
named
schrader
on
venus
had
killed
a
gern
with
his
own
blaster
and
then
disappeared
with
both
infuriated
gerns
and
venusian
police
in
pursuit
there
had
been
a
high
reward
for
his
capture
he
looked
it
over
and
said
i
was
counting
on
you
giving
us
this
only
the
barest
trace
of
surprise
showed
on
schroeder
face
but
his
eyes
were
intently
watching
lake
so
you
knew
all
the
time
who
i
was
i
knew
did
anyone
else
on
the
know
you
were
recognized
by
one
of
the
ship
officers
you
would
have
been
tried
in
two
more
days
i
see
schroeder
said
and
since
i
was
guilty
and
could
be
returned
to
earth
or
venus
i
have
been
executed
on
the
he
smiled
sardonically
and
you
as
would
have
been
my
execution
master
of
ceremonies
lake
put
the
parchment
sheets
back
together
in
their
proper
order
sometimes
he
said
a
ship
officer
has
to
do
things
that
are
contrary
to
all
his
own
wishes
schroeder
drew
a
deep
breath
his
face
sombre
with
the
memories
he
had
kept
to
himself
it
was
two
years
ago
when
the
gerns
were
still
talking
friendship
to
the
earth
government
while
they
shoved
the
colonists
around
on
venus
this
gern
there
was
a
girl
there
and
he
thought
he
could
do
what
he
wanted
to
her
because
he
was
a
mighty
gern
and
she
was
nothing
he
did
that
why
i
killed
him
i
had
to
kill
two
venusian
police
to
get
away
that
where
i
put
the
rope
around
my
neck
it
not
what
we
did
but
what
we
do
that
we
live
or
die
by
on
ragnarok
lake
said
he
handed
schroeder
the
sheets
of
parchment
tell
craig
to
make
at
least
four
copies
of
this
someday
our
knowledge
of
gern
blasters
may
be
something
else
we
live
or
die
by
the
school
and
writing
were
interrupted
by
the
spring
hunting
craig
made
his
journey
to
the
plateau
mountain
but
he
was
unable
to
keep
his
promise
to
prospect
it
the
plateau
was
perhaps
ten
thousand
feet
in
elevation
and
the
mountain
rose
another
ten
thousand
feet
above
the
plateau
no
human
could
climb
such
a
mountain
in
a
gravity
i
tried
he
told
lake
wearily
when
he
came
back
damn
it
i
never
tried
harder
at
anything
in
my
life
it
was
just
too
much
for
me
maybe
some
of
the
young
ones
will
be
better
adapted
and
can
do
it
when
they
grow
up
craig
brought
back
several
sheets
of
unusually
transparent
mica
each
sheet
a
foot
in
diameter
and
a
dozen
large
quartz
crystals
float
from
higher
up
on
the
mountain
he
said
the
mica
and
crystals
are
in
place
up
there
if
we
could
only
reach
them
other
minerals
too
i
panned
traces
in
the
canyon
bottoms
but
no
iron
lake
examined
the
sheets
of
mica
we
could
make
windows
for
the
outer
caves
of
these
he
said
have
them
double
thickness
with
a
wide
air
space
between
for
insulation
as
for
the
quartz
crystals
optical
instruments
craig
said
binoculars
microscopes
it
would
take
us
a
long
time
to
learn
how
to
make
glass
as
clear
and
flawless
as
those
crystals
but
we
have
no
way
of
cutting
and
grinding
them
craig
went
to
the
east
that
fall
and
to
the
west
the
next
spring
he
returned
from
the
trip
to
the
west
with
a
twisted
knee
that
would
never
let
him
go
prospecting
again
it
will
take
years
to
find
the
metals
we
need
he
said
the
indications
are
that
we
never
will
but
i
wanted
to
keep
on
trying
now
my
damned
knee
has
me
chained
to
these
caves
he
reconciled
himself
to
his
lameness
and
confinement
as
best
he
could
and
finished
his
textbook
geology
and
mineral
identification
he
also
taught
a
geology
class
during
the
winters
it
was
in
the
winter
of
the
year
four
on
ragnarok
that
a
boy
entered
his
class
the
silent
billy
humbolt
he
was
by
far
the
youngest
of
craig
students
and
the
most
attentive
lake
was
present
one
day
when
craig
asked
curiously
it
not
often
a
boy
your
age
is
so
interested
in
mineralogy
and
geology
billy
is
there
something
more
than
just
interest
i
have
to
learn
all
about
minerals
billy
said
with
seriousness
so
that
when
i
grown
i
can
find
the
metals
for
us
to
make
a
ship
and
then
craig
asked
and
then
we
go
to
athena
to
kill
the
gerns
who
caused
my
mother
to
die
and
my
grandfather
and
julia
and
all
the
others
and
to
free
my
father
and
the
other
slaves
if
they
still
alive
i
see
craig
said
he
did
not
smile
his
face
was
shadowed
and
old
as
he
looked
at
the
boy
and
beyond
him
seeing
again
perhaps
the
frail
blonde
girl
and
the
two
children
that
the
first
quick
violent
months
had
taken
from
him
i
hope
you
succeed
he
said
i
wish
i
was
young
so
i
could
dream
of
the
same
thing
but
i
not
so
let
get
back
to
the
identification
of
the
ores
that
will
be
needed
to
make
a
ship
to
go
to
athena
and
to
make
blasters
to
kill
gerns
after
you
get
there
lake
had
a
corral
built
early
the
following
spring
with
camouflaged
wings
to
trap
some
of
the
woods
goats
when
they
came
it
would
be
an
immense
forward
step
toward
conquering
their
new
environment
if
they
could
domesticate
the
goats
and
have
goat
herds
near
the
caves
all
through
the
year
gathering
enough
grass
to
last
a
herd
of
goats
through
the
winter
would
be
a
problem
but
first
before
they
worried
about
that
they
would
have
to
see
if
the
goats
could
survive
the
summer
and
winter
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
they
trapped
ten
goats
that
spring
they
built
them
brush
sunshades
before
summer
was
over
the
winds
would
have
stripped
the
trees
of
most
of
their
dry
brown
leaves
and
a
stream
of
water
was
diverted
through
the
corral
it
was
all
work
in
vain
the
goats
died
from
the
heat
in
early
summer
together
with
the
young
that
had
been
born
when
fall
came
they
trapped
six
more
goats
they
built
them
shelters
that
would
be
as
warm
as
possible
and
carried
them
a
large
supply
of
the
tall
grass
from
along
the
creek
banks
enough
to
last
them
through
the
winter
but
the
cold
was
too
much
for
the
goats
and
the
second
blizzard
killed
them
all
the
next
spring
and
fall
and
with
much
more
difficulty
they
tried
the
experiment
with
pairs
of
unicorns
the
results
were
the
same
which
meant
they
would
remain
a
race
of
hunters
ragnarok
would
not
permit
them
to
be
herdsmen
the
years
went
by
each
much
like
the
one
before
it
but
for
the
rapid
aging
of
the
old
ones
as
lake
and
the
others
called
themselves
and
the
growing
up
of
the
young
ones
no
woman
among
the
old
ones
could
any
longer
have
children
but
six
more
normal
healthy
children
had
been
born
like
the
first
two
they
were
not
affected
by
the
gravity
as
babies
had
been
among
the
young
ones
lake
saw
was
a
distinguishable
difference
those
who
had
been
very
young
the
day
the
gerns
left
them
to
die
had
adapted
better
than
those
who
had
been
a
few
years
older
the
environment
of
ragnarok
had
struck
at
the
very
young
with
merciless
savagery
it
had
subjected
them
to
a
test
of
survival
that
was
without
precedent
on
earth
it
had
killed
them
by
the
hundreds
but
among
them
had
been
those
whose
young
flesh
and
blood
and
organs
had
resisted
death
by
adapting
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
the
day
of
the
old
ones
was
almost
done
and
the
future
would
soon
be
in
the
hands
of
the
young
ones
they
were
the
ninety
unconquerables
out
of
what
had
been
four
thousand
rejects
the
first
generation
of
what
would
be
a
new
race
it
seemed
to
lake
that
the
years
came
and
went
ever
faster
as
the
old
ones
dwindled
in
numbers
at
an
accelerating
rate
anders
had
died
in
the
sixth
year
his
heart
failing
him
one
night
as
he
worked
patiently
in
his
crude
little
laboratory
at
carrying
on
the
work
started
by
chiara
to
find
a
cure
for
the
hell
fever
barber
trying
to
develop
a
strain
of
herbs
that
would
grow
in
the
lower
elevation
of
the
caves
was
killed
by
a
unicorn
as
he
worked
in
his
test
plot
below
the
caves
craig
went
limping
out
one
spring
day
on
the
eighth
year
to
look
at
a
new
mineral
a
hunter
had
found
a
mile
from
the
caves
a
sudden
cold
rain
blew
up
chilling
him
before
he
could
return
and
he
died
of
hell
fever
the
same
day
schroeder
was
killed
by
prowlers
the
same
year
dying
with
his
back
to
a
tree
and
a
bloody
knife
in
his
hand
it
was
the
way
he
would
have
wanted
to
go
once
he
had
said
to
lake
when
my
times
comes
i
would
rather
it
be
against
the
prowlers
they
fight
hard
and
kill
quick
and
then
they
through
with
you
they
tear
you
up
after
you
dead
and
slobber
and
gloat
over
the
pieces
the
way
the
unicorns
do
the
springs
came
a
little
earlier
each
year
the
falls
a
little
later
and
the
observations
showed
the
suns
progressing
steadily
northward
but
the
winters
though
shorter
were
seemingly
as
cold
as
ever
the
long
summers
reached
such
a
degree
of
heat
on
the
ninth
year
that
lake
knew
they
could
endure
no
more
than
two
or
three
years
more
of
the
increasing
heat
then
in
the
summer
of
the
tenth
year
the
tilting
of
ragnarok
the
apparent
northward
progress
of
the
suns
stopped
they
were
in
the
middle
of
what
craig
had
called
big
summer
and
they
could
endure
it
just
barely
they
would
not
have
to
leave
the
caves
the
suns
started
their
drift
southward
the
observations
were
continued
and
carefully
recorded
big
fall
was
coming
and
behind
it
would
be
big
winter
big
winter
the
threat
of
it
worried
lake
how
far
to
the
south
would
the
suns
go
how
long
would
they
stay
would
the
time
come
when
the
plateau
would
be
buried
under
hundreds
of
feet
of
snow
and
the
caves
enclosed
in
glacial
ice
there
was
no
way
he
could
ever
know
or
even
guess
only
those
of
the
future
would
ever
know
on
the
twelfth
year
only
lake
and
west
were
left
of
the
old
ones
by
then
there
were
left
of
the
young
ones
eight
children
of
the
old
ones
and
four
children
of
the
young
ones
not
counting
himself
and
west
there
were
of
them
it
was
not
many
to
be
the
beginnings
of
a
race
that
would
face
an
ice
age
of
unknown
proportions
and
have
over
them
always
the
threat
of
a
chance
return
of
the
gerns
the
winter
of
the
fifteenth
year
came
and
he
was
truly
alone
the
last
of
the
old
ones
and
aged
far
beyond
his
years
he
was
still
leader
but
that
winter
he
could
do
little
other
than
sit
by
his
fire
and
feel
the
gravity
dragging
at
his
heart
he
knew
long
before
spring
that
it
was
time
he
chose
his
successor
he
had
hoped
to
live
to
see
his
son
take
his
place
but
jim
was
only
thirteen
among
the
others
was
one
he
had
been
watching
since
the
day
he
told
craig
he
would
find
metals
to
build
a
ship
and
kill
the
gerns
bill
humbolt
bill
humbolt
was
not
the
oldest
among
those
who
would
make
leaders
but
he
was
the
most
versatile
of
them
all
the
most
thoughtful
and
stubbornly
determined
he
reminded
lake
of
that
fierce
old
man
who
had
been
his
grandfather
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
scars
that
twisted
his
face
into
grim
ugliness
he
would
have
looked
much
like
him
a
violent
storm
was
roaring
outside
the
caves
the
night
he
told
the
others
that
he
wanted
bill
humbolt
to
be
his
successor
there
were
no
objections
and
without
ceremony
and
with
few
words
he
terminated
his
fifteen
years
of
leadership
he
left
the
others
his
son
among
them
and
went
back
to
the
cave
where
he
slept
his
fire
was
low
down
to
dying
embers
but
he
was
too
tired
to
build
it
up
again
he
lay
down
on
his
pallet
and
saw
with
neither
surprise
nor
fear
that
his
time
was
much
nearer
than
he
had
thought
it
was
already
at
hand
he
lay
back
and
let
the
lassitude
enclose
him
not
fighting
it
he
had
done
the
best
he
could
for
the
others
and
now
the
weary
journey
was
over
his
thoughts
dissolved
into
the
memory
of
the
day
fifteen
years
before
the
roaring
of
the
storm
became
the
thunder
of
the
gern
cruisers
as
they
disappeared
into
the
gray
sky
four
thousand
rejects
stood
in
the
cold
wind
and
watched
them
go
the
children
not
yet
understanding
that
they
had
been
condemned
to
die
somehow
his
own
son
was
among
them
he
tried
feebly
to
rise
there
was
work
to
do
a
lot
of
work
to
do
part
it
was
early
morning
as
bill
humbolt
sat
by
the
fire
in
his
cave
and
studied
the
map
craig
had
made
of
the
plateau
mountain
craig
had
left
the
mountain
nameless
and
he
dipped
his
pen
in
ink
to
write
bill
delmont
anders
entered
very
quietly
what
he
had
to
tell
already
evident
on
his
face
he
died
last
night
bill
it
was
something
he
had
been
expecting
to
come
at
any
time
but
the
lack
of
surprise
did
not
diminish
the
sense
of
loss
lake
had
been
the
last
of
the
old
ones
the
last
of
those
who
had
worked
and
fought
and
shortened
the
years
of
their
lives
that
the
young
ones
might
have
a
chance
to
live
now
he
was
gone
now
a
brief
era
was
ended
a
valiant
bloody
chapter
written
and
finished
and
he
was
the
new
leader
who
would
decree
how
the
next
chapter
should
be
written
only
four
years
older
than
the
boy
who
was
looking
at
him
with
an
unconscious
appeal
for
reassurance
on
his
face
you
better
tell
jim
he
said
then
a
little
later
i
want
to
talk
to
everyone
about
the
things
we
start
doing
as
soon
as
spring
comes
you
mean
the
hunting
delmont
asked
no
more
than
just
the
hunting
he
sat
for
a
while
after
delmont
left
looking
back
down
the
years
that
had
preceded
that
day
back
to
that
first
morning
on
ragnarok
he
had
set
a
goal
for
himself
that
morning
when
he
left
his
toy
bear
in
the
dust
behind
him
and
walked
beside
julia
into
the
new
and
perilous
way
of
life
he
had
promised
himself
that
some
day
he
would
watch
the
gerns
die
and
beg
for
mercy
as
they
died
and
he
would
give
them
the
same
mercy
they
had
given
his
mother
as
he
grew
older
he
realized
that
his
hatred
alone
was
a
futile
thing
there
would
have
to
be
a
way
of
leaving
ragnarok
and
there
would
have
to
be
weapons
with
which
to
fight
the
gerns
these
would
be
things
impossible
and
beyond
his
reach
unless
he
had
the
help
of
all
the
others
in
united
coordinated
effort
to
make
certain
of
that
united
effort
he
would
have
to
be
their
leader
so
for
eleven
years
he
had
studied
and
trained
until
there
was
no
one
who
could
use
a
bow
or
spear
quite
as
well
as
he
could
no
one
who
could
travel
as
far
in
a
day
or
spot
a
unicorn
ambush
as
quickly
and
there
was
no
one
with
the
exception
of
george
ord
who
had
studied
as
many
textbooks
as
he
had
he
had
reached
his
first
goal
he
was
leader
for
all
of
them
there
existed
the
second
goal
the
hope
of
someday
leaving
ragnarok
and
taking
athena
from
the
gerns
for
many
of
them
perhaps
it
was
only
wishful
dreaming
but
for
him
it
was
the
prime
driving
force
of
his
life
there
was
so
much
for
them
to
do
and
their
lives
were
so
short
in
which
to
do
it
for
so
long
as
he
was
leader
they
would
not
waste
a
day
in
idle
wishing
when
the
others
were
gathered
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
he
spoke
to
them
we
going
to
continue
where
the
old
ones
had
to
leave
off
better
adapted
than
they
were
and
we
going
to
find
metals
to
make
a
ship
if
there
are
any
to
be
found
somewhere
on
ragnarok
on
the
northwest
side
of
a
range
similar
to
the
craig
mountains
on
the
plateau
is
a
deep
valley
that
the
dunbar
expedition
called
the
chasm
they
did
investigate
it
closely
since
their
instruments
showed
no
metals
there
but
they
saw
strata
in
one
place
that
was
red
an
iron
discoloration
maybe
we
can
find
a
vein
there
that
was
too
small
for
them
to
have
paid
any
attention
to
so
we
go
over
the
craigs
as
soon
as
the
snow
melts
from
them
that
will
be
in
early
summer
george
ord
said
his
black
eyes
thoughtful
whoever
goes
will
have
to
time
their
return
for
either
just
before
the
prowlers
and
unicorns
come
back
from
the
north
or
wait
until
they
all
migrated
down
off
the
plateau
it
was
something
humbolt
had
been
thinking
about
and
wishing
they
could
remedy
men
could
elude
unicorn
attacks
wherever
there
were
trees
large
enough
to
offer
safety
and
even
prowler
attacks
could
be
warded
off
wherever
there
were
trees
for
refuge
spears
holding
back
the
prowlers
who
would
climb
the
trees
while
arrows
picked
off
the
ones
on
the
ground
but
there
were
no
trees
on
the
plateau
and
to
be
caught
by
a
band
of
prowlers
or
unicorns
there
was
certain
death
for
any
small
party
of
two
or
three
for
that
reason
no
small
parties
had
ever
gone
up
on
the
plateau
except
when
the
unicorns
and
prowlers
were
gone
or
nearly
so
it
was
an
inconvenience
and
it
would
continue
for
as
long
as
their
weapons
were
the
bows
you
supposed
to
be
our
combination
he
said
to
george
no
one
else
can
compare
with
you
in
that
respect
besides
you
not
exactly
enthusiastic
about
such
hard
work
as
mountain
climbing
so
from
now
on
you
do
the
kind
of
work
you
best
fitted
for
your
first
job
is
to
make
us
a
better
bow
make
it
like
a
crossbow
with
a
sliding
action
to
draw
and
cock
the
string
and
with
a
magazine
of
arrows
mounted
on
top
of
it
george
studied
the
idea
thoughtfully
the
general
principle
is
simple
he
said
i
see
what
i
can
do
how
many
of
us
will
go
over
the
craig
mountains
bill
dan
barber
asked
you
and
i
humbolt
answered
a
party
under
bob
craig
will
go
into
the
western
hills
and
another
party
under
johnny
stevens
will
go
into
the
eastern
hills
he
looked
toward
the
adjoining
cave
where
the
guns
had
been
stored
for
so
long
coated
with
unicorn
tallow
to
protect
them
from
rust
we
could
make
gun
powder
if
we
could
find
a
deposit
of
saltpeter
we
already
know
where
there
a
little
sulphur
the
guns
would
have
to
be
converted
to
flintlocks
though
since
we
do
have
what
we
need
for
cartridge
priming
material
worse
we
have
to
use
ceramic
bullets
they
would
be
inefficient
too
light
and
destructive
to
the
bores
but
we
would
need
powder
for
mining
if
we
ever
found
any
iron
and
if
we
ca
have
metal
bullets
to
shoot
the
gerns
we
can
have
bombs
to
blast
them
with
suppose
johnny
stevens
said
that
we
never
do
find
the
metals
to
make
a
ship
how
will
we
ever
leave
ragnarok
if
that
happens
there
another
way
a
possible
way
of
leaving
here
without
a
ship
of
our
own
if
there
are
no
metals
we
have
to
try
it
why
wait
bob
craig
demanded
why
not
try
it
now
because
the
odds
would
be
about
ten
thousand
to
one
in
favor
of
the
gerns
but
we
try
it
if
everything
else
fails
george
made
altered
and
rejected
four
different
types
of
crossbows
before
he
perfected
a
reloading
bow
that
met
his
critical
approval
he
brought
it
to
where
humbolt
stood
outside
the
caves
early
one
spring
day
when
the
grass
was
sending
up
the
first
green
shoots
on
the
southern
hillsides
and
the
long
winter
was
finally
dying
here
it
is
he
said
handing
humbolt
the
bow
try
it
he
took
it
noting
the
fine
balance
of
it
projecting
down
from
the
center
of
the
bow
at
right
angles
to
it
was
a
stock
shaped
to
fit
the
grip
of
the
left
hand
under
the
crossbar
was
a
sliding
stock
for
the
right
hand
shaped
like
the
butt
of
a
pistol
and
fitted
with
a
trigger
mounted
slightly
above
and
to
one
side
of
the
crossbar
was
a
magazine
containing
ten
short
arrows
the
pistol
grip
was
in
position
near
the
forestock
he
pulled
it
back
the
length
of
the
crossbar
and
it
brought
the
string
with
it
stretching
it
taut
there
was
a
click
as
the
trigger
mechanism
locked
the
bowstring
in
place
and
at
the
same
time
a
concealed
spring
arrangement
shoved
an
arrow
into
place
against
the
string
he
took
quick
aim
at
a
distant
tree
and
pressed
the
trigger
there
was
a
twang
as
the
arrow
was
ejected
he
jerked
the
sliding
pistol
grip
forward
and
back
to
reload
pressing
the
trigger
an
instant
later
another
arrow
went
its
way
by
the
time
he
had
fired
the
tenth
arrow
in
the
magazine
he
was
shooting
at
the
rate
of
one
arrow
per
second
on
the
trunk
of
the
distant
tree
like
a
bristle
of
stiff
whiskers
the
ten
arrows
were
driven
deep
into
the
wood
in
an
area
no
larger
than
the
chest
of
a
prowler
or
head
of
a
unicorn
this
is
better
than
i
hoped
for
he
said
to
george
one
man
with
one
of
these
would
equal
six
men
with
ordinary
bows
i
going
to
add
another
feature
george
said
bundles
of
arrows
ten
to
the
bundle
in
special
holders
to
carry
in
the
quivers
to
reload
the
magazine
you
just
slap
down
a
new
bundle
of
arrows
in
no
more
time
than
it
would
take
to
put
one
arrow
in
an
ordinary
bow
i
figured
that
with
practice
a
man
should
be
able
to
get
off
forty
arrows
in
not
much
more
than
twenty
seconds
george
took
the
bow
and
went
back
in
the
cave
to
add
his
new
feature
humbolt
stared
after
him
thinking
he
can
make
something
like
that
out
of
wood
and
unicorn
gut
what
would
he
be
able
to
give
us
if
he
could
have
metal
perhaps
george
would
never
have
the
opportunity
to
show
what
he
could
do
with
metal
but
humbolt
already
felt
sure
that
george
genius
would
if
it
ever
became
necessary
make
possible
the
alternate
plan
for
leaving
ragnarok
the
weeks
dragged
into
months
and
at
last
enough
snow
was
gone
from
the
craigs
that
humbolt
and
dan
barber
could
start
they
met
no
opposition
the
prowlers
had
long
since
disappeared
into
the
north
and
the
unicorns
were
very
scarce
they
had
no
occasion
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
the
new
automatic
crossbows
in
combat
a
lack
of
opportunity
that
irked
barber
any
other
time
if
we
had
ordinary
bows
he
complained
the
unicorns
would
be
popping
up
to
charge
us
from
all
directions
do
fret
humbolt
consoled
him
this
fall
when
we
come
back
they
will
be
they
reached
the
mountain
and
stopped
near
its
foot
where
a
creek
came
down
its
water
high
and
muddy
with
melting
snows
there
they
hunted
until
they
had
obtained
all
the
meat
they
could
carry
they
would
see
no
more
game
when
they
went
up
the
mountain
canyons
a
poisonous
weed
replaced
most
of
the
grass
in
all
the
canyons
and
the
animals
of
ragnarok
had
learned
long
before
to
shun
the
mountain
they
found
the
canyon
that
craig
and
his
men
had
tried
to
explore
and
started
up
it
it
was
there
that
craig
had
discovered
the
quartz
and
mica
and
so
far
as
he
had
been
able
to
tell
the
head
of
that
canyon
would
be
the
lowest
of
all
the
passes
over
the
mountain
the
canyon
went
up
the
mountain
diagonally
so
that
the
climb
was
not
steep
although
it
was
constant
they
began
to
see
mica
and
quartz
crystals
in
the
creek
bed
and
at
noon
on
the
second
day
they
passed
the
last
stunted
tree
nothing
grew
higher
than
that
point
but
the
thorny
poison
weeds
and
they
were
scarce
the
air
was
noticeably
thinner
there
and
their
burdens
heavier
a
short
distance
beyond
they
came
to
a
small
rock
monument
craig
point
the
next
day
they
found
the
quartz
crystals
in
place
a
mile
farther
was
the
vein
the
mica
had
come
from
of
the
other
minerals
craig
had
hoped
to
find
however
there
were
only
traces
the
fourth
day
was
an
eternity
of
struggling
up
the
canyon
under
loads
that
seemed
to
weigh
hundreds
of
pounds
forcing
their
protesting
legs
to
carry
them
fifty
steps
at
a
time
at
the
end
of
which
they
would
stop
to
rest
while
their
lungs
labored
to
suck
in
the
thin
air
in
quick
panting
breaths
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
have
gone
around
the
mountain
but
the
chasm
was
supposed
to
be
like
a
huge
cavity
scooped
out
of
the
plateau
beyond
the
mountain
rimmed
with
sheer
cliffs
a
mile
high
only
on
the
side
next
to
the
mountain
was
there
a
slope
leading
down
into
it
they
stopped
for
the
night
where
the
creek
ended
in
a
small
spring
there
the
snow
still
clung
to
the
canyon
walls
and
there
the
canyon
curved
offering
them
the
promise
of
the
summit
just
around
the
bend
as
it
had
been
doing
all
day
the
sun
was
hot
and
bright
the
next
morning
as
they
made
their
slow
way
on
again
the
canyon
straightened
the
steep
walls
of
it
flattening
out
to
make
a
pair
of
ragged
shoulders
with
a
saddle
between
them
they
climbed
to
the
summit
of
the
saddle
and
there
suddenly
before
them
was
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
the
chasm
far
below
them
was
a
plateau
stretching
endlessly
like
the
one
they
had
left
behind
them
but
the
chasm
dominated
all
else
it
was
a
gigantic
valley
a
hundred
miles
long
by
forty
miles
wide
sunk
deep
in
the
plateau
with
the
tops
of
its
walls
level
with
the
floor
of
the
plateau
the
mountain
under
them
dropped
swiftly
away
sloping
down
and
down
to
the
level
of
the
plateau
and
then
on
down
and
down
again
to
the
bottom
of
the
chasm
that
was
so
deep
its
floor
was
half
hidden
by
the
morning
shadows
my
god
barber
said
it
must
be
over
three
miles
under
us
to
the
bottom
on
the
vertical
ten
miles
of
per
cent
grade
if
we
go
down
we
never
get
out
again
you
can
turn
back
here
if
you
want
to
humbolt
said
turn
back
barber
red
whiskers
seemed
to
bristle
who
in
hell
said
anything
about
turning
back
nobody
humbolt
said
smiling
a
little
at
barber
quick
flash
of
anger
he
studied
the
chasm
wishing
that
they
could
have
some
way
of
cutting
the
quartz
crystals
and
making
binoculars
it
was
a
long
way
to
look
with
the
naked
eye
here
and
there
the
chasm
thrust
out
arms
into
the
plateau
all
the
arms
were
short
however
and
even
at
their
heads
the
cliffs
were
vertical
the
morning
shadows
prevented
a
clear
view
of
much
of
the
chasm
and
he
could
see
no
sign
of
the
strata
that
they
were
searching
for
in
the
southwest
corner
of
the
chasm
far
away
and
almost
imperceptible
he
saw
a
faint
cloud
rising
up
from
the
chasm
floor
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
it
was
and
it
faded
away
as
he
watched
barber
saw
it
too
and
said
it
looked
like
smoke
do
you
suppose
there
could
be
people
or
some
kind
of
intelligent
things
living
down
there
it
might
have
been
the
vapor
from
hot
springs
condensed
by
the
cool
morning
air
he
said
whatever
it
was
we
look
into
it
when
we
get
there
the
climb
down
the
steep
slope
into
the
chasm
was
swifter
than
that
up
the
canyon
but
no
more
pleasant
carrying
a
heavy
pack
down
such
a
grade
exerted
a
torturous
strain
upon
the
backs
of
the
legs
the
heat
increased
steadily
as
they
descended
they
reached
the
floor
of
the
valley
the
next
day
and
the
noonday
heat
was
so
great
that
humbolt
wondered
if
they
might
not
have
trapped
themselves
into
what
the
summer
would
soon
transform
into
a
monstrous
oven
where
no
life
at
all
could
exist
there
could
never
be
any
choice
of
course
the
mountains
were
passable
only
when
the
weather
was
hot
the
floor
of
the
valley
was
silt
sand
and
gravel
they
would
find
nothing
there
they
set
out
on
a
circuit
of
the
chasm
walls
following
along
close
to
the
base
in
many
places
the
walls
were
without
a
single
ledge
to
break
their
vertical
faces
when
they
came
to
the
first
such
place
they
saw
that
the
ground
near
the
base
was
riddled
with
queer
little
pits
like
tiny
craters
of
the
moon
as
they
looked
there
was
a
crack
like
a
cannon
shot
and
the
ground
beside
them
erupted
into
an
explosion
of
sand
and
gravel
when
the
dust
had
cleared
away
there
was
a
new
crater
where
none
had
been
before
humbolt
wiped
the
blood
from
his
face
where
a
flying
fragment
had
cut
it
and
said
the
heat
of
the
sun
loosens
rocks
up
on
the
rim
when
one
falls
a
mile
in
a
one
point
five
gravity
it
traveling
like
a
meteor
they
went
on
through
the
danger
zone
as
with
the
peril
of
the
heat
there
was
no
choice
only
by
observing
the
material
that
littered
the
base
of
the
cliffs
could
they
know
what
minerals
if
any
might
be
above
them
on
the
fifteenth
day
they
saw
the
stratum
humbolt
quickened
his
pace
hurrying
forward
in
advance
of
barber
the
stratum
was
too
high
up
on
the
wall
to
be
reached
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
examine
it
in
place
the
base
of
the
cliff
was
piled
thick
with
fragments
from
it
he
felt
the
first
touch
of
discouragement
as
he
looked
at
them
they
were
a
sandstone
light
in
weight
the
iron
present
was
only
what
the
dunbar
expedition
had
thought
it
to
be
a
mere
discoloration
they
made
their
way
slowly
along
the
foot
of
the
cliff
examining
piece
after
piece
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
more
than
iron
stains
there
was
no
variation
however
and
a
mile
farther
on
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
red
stratum
beyond
that
point
the
rocks
were
gray
without
a
vestige
of
iron
so
that
barber
said
looking
back
the
way
they
had
come
is
what
we
were
going
to
build
a
ship
out
of
iron
stains
humbolt
did
not
answer
for
him
it
was
more
than
a
disappointment
it
was
the
death
of
a
dream
he
had
held
since
the
year
he
was
nine
and
had
heard
that
the
dunbar
expedition
had
seen
rock
in
a
deep
chasm
the
only
rock
on
the
face
of
ragnarok
surely
he
had
thought
there
would
be
enough
iron
there
to
build
a
small
ship
for
eleven
years
he
had
worked
toward
the
day
when
he
would
find
it
now
he
had
found
it
and
it
was
nothing
the
ship
was
as
far
away
as
ever
but
discouragement
was
as
useless
as
sandstone
he
shook
it
off
and
turned
to
barber
let
go
he
said
maybe
we
find
something
by
the
time
we
circle
the
chasm
for
seven
days
they
risked
the
danger
of
death
from
downward
plunging
rocks
and
found
nothing
on
the
eighth
day
they
found
the
treasure
that
was
not
treasure
they
stopped
for
the
evening
just
within
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
tributaries
humbolt
went
out
to
get
a
drink
where
a
trickle
of
water
ran
through
the
sand
and
as
he
knelt
down
he
saw
the
flash
of
something
red
under
him
almost
buried
in
the
sand
he
lifted
it
out
it
was
a
stone
half
the
size
of
his
hand
darkly
translucent
and
glowing
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
like
blood
it
was
a
ruby
he
looked
and
saw
another
gleam
a
little
farther
up
the
stream
it
was
another
ruby
almost
as
large
as
the
first
one
near
it
was
a
flawless
blue
sapphire
scattered
here
and
there
were
smaller
rubies
and
sapphires
down
to
the
size
of
grains
of
sand
he
went
farther
upstream
and
saw
specimens
of
still
another
stone
they
were
colorless
but
burning
with
internal
fires
he
rubbed
one
of
them
hard
across
the
ruby
he
still
carried
and
there
was
a
gritting
sound
as
it
cut
a
deep
scratch
in
the
ruby
i
be
damned
he
said
aloud
there
was
only
one
stone
hard
enough
to
cut
a
ruby
the
diamond
it
was
almost
dark
when
he
returned
to
where
barber
was
resting
beside
their
packs
what
did
you
find
to
keep
you
out
so
late
barber
asked
curiously
he
dropped
a
double
handful
of
rubies
sapphires
and
diamonds
at
barber
feet
take
a
look
he
said
on
a
civilized
world
what
you
see
there
would
buy
us
a
ship
without
our
having
to
lift
a
finger
here
they
just
pretty
rocks
except
the
diamonds
he
added
at
least
we
now
have
something
to
cut
those
quartz
crystals
with
they
took
only
a
few
of
the
rubies
and
sapphires
the
next
morning
but
they
gathered
more
of
the
diamonds
looking
in
particular
for
the
and
ugly
but
very
hard
and
tough
carbonado
variety
then
they
resumed
their
circling
of
the
chasm
walls
the
heat
continued
its
steady
increase
as
the
days
went
by
only
at
night
was
there
any
relief
from
it
and
the
nights
were
growing
swiftly
shorter
as
the
blue
sun
rose
earlier
each
morning
when
the
yellow
sun
rose
the
chasm
became
a
blazing
furnace
around
the
edge
of
which
they
crept
like
ants
in
some
gigantic
oven
there
was
no
life
in
any
form
to
be
seen
no
animal
or
bush
or
blade
of
grass
there
was
only
the
barren
floor
of
the
chasm
made
a
harsh
green
shade
by
the
two
suns
and
writhing
and
undulating
with
heat
waves
like
a
nightmare
sea
while
above
them
the
towering
cliffs
shimmered
too
and
sometimes
seemed
to
be
leaning
far
out
over
their
heads
and
already
falling
down
upon
them
they
found
no
more
minerals
of
any
kind
and
they
came
at
last
to
the
place
where
they
had
seen
the
smoke
or
vapor
there
the
walls
of
the
chasm
drew
back
to
form
a
little
valley
a
mile
long
by
half
a
mile
wide
the
walls
did
not
drop
vertically
to
the
floor
there
but
sloped
out
at
the
base
into
a
fantastic
formation
of
natural
roofs
and
arches
that
reached
almost
to
the
center
of
the
valley
from
each
side
green
things
grew
in
the
shade
under
the
arches
and
sparkling
waterfalls
cascaded
down
over
many
of
them
a
small
creek
carried
the
water
out
of
the
valley
going
out
into
the
chasm
a
little
way
before
the
hot
sands
absorbed
it
they
stood
and
watched
for
some
time
but
there
was
no
movement
in
the
valley
other
than
the
waving
of
the
green
plants
as
a
breeze
stirred
them
once
the
breeze
shifted
to
bring
them
the
fresh
sweet
scent
of
growing
things
and
urge
them
to
come
closer
a
place
like
that
does
belong
here
barber
said
in
a
low
voice
but
it
there
i
wonder
what
else
is
there
shade
and
cool
water
humbolt
said
and
maybe
things
that
do
like
strangers
let
go
find
out
they
watched
warily
as
they
walked
their
crossbows
in
their
hands
at
the
closer
range
they
saw
that
the
roofs
and
arches
were
the
outer
remains
of
a
system
of
natural
caves
that
went
back
into
the
walls
the
green
vegetation
grew
wherever
the
roofs
gave
shade
consisting
mainly
of
a
bush
with
purple
flowers
and
a
tall
plant
resembling
corn
under
some
of
the
roofs
the
corn
was
mature
the
orange
colored
grains
visible
under
others
it
was
no
more
than
half
grown
he
saw
the
reason
and
said
to
barber
there
are
both
warm
and
cold
springs
here
the
plants
watered
by
the
warm
springs
would
grow
almost
the
year
around
the
ones
watered
by
the
cold
springs
only
in
the
summer
and
what
we
saw
from
the
mountain
top
would
have
been
vapor
rising
from
the
warm
springs
they
passed
under
arch
after
arch
without
seeing
any
life
when
they
came
to
the
valley
upper
end
and
still
had
seen
nothing
it
seemed
evident
that
there
was
little
danger
of
an
encounter
with
any
creatures
apparently
nothing
at
all
lived
in
the
little
valley
humbolt
stopped
under
a
broad
arch
where
the
breeze
was
made
cool
and
moist
by
the
spray
of
water
it
had
come
through
barber
went
on
to
look
under
the
adjoining
arch
caves
led
into
the
wall
from
both
arches
and
as
he
stood
there
humbolt
saw
something
lying
in
the
mouth
of
the
nearest
cave
it
was
a
little
mound
of
orange
corn
lying
in
a
neat
pile
as
though
whatever
had
left
it
there
had
intended
to
come
back
after
it
he
looked
toward
the
other
arch
but
barber
was
somewhere
out
of
sight
he
doubted
that
whatever
had
left
the
corn
could
be
much
of
a
menace
dangerous
animals
were
more
apt
to
eat
flesh
than
corn
but
he
went
to
the
cave
with
his
crossbow
ready
he
stopped
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
to
let
his
eyes
become
accustomed
to
the
darkness
inside
it
as
he
did
so
the
things
inside
came
out
to
meet
him
they
emerged
into
full
view
six
little
animals
the
size
of
squirrels
each
of
them
a
different
color
they
walked
on
short
hind
legs
like
miniature
bears
and
the
dark
eyes
in
the
faces
were
fixed
on
him
with
intense
interest
they
stopped
five
feet
in
front
of
him
there
to
stand
in
a
neat
row
and
continue
the
fascinated
staring
up
at
him
the
yellow
one
in
the
center
scratched
absently
at
its
stomach
with
a
furry
paw
and
he
lowered
the
bow
feeling
a
little
foolish
at
having
bothered
to
raise
it
against
animals
so
small
and
harmless
then
he
half
brought
it
up
again
as
the
yellow
one
opened
its
mouth
and
said
in
a
tone
that
held
distinct
anticipation
i
think
we
eat
you
for
supper
he
darted
glances
to
right
and
left
but
there
was
nothing
near
him
except
the
six
little
animals
the
yellow
one
having
spoken
was
staring
silently
at
him
with
only
curiosity
on
its
furry
face
he
wondered
if
some
miasma
or
some
scent
from
the
vegetation
in
the
valley
had
warped
his
mind
into
sudden
insanity
and
asked
you
think
you
do
what
it
opened
its
mouth
again
to
stutter
i
i
then
with
a
note
of
alarm
hey
it
said
no
more
and
the
next
sound
was
that
of
barber
hurrying
toward
him
and
calling
hey
bill
where
are
you
here
he
answered
and
he
was
already
sure
that
he
knew
why
the
little
animal
had
spoken
to
him
barber
came
up
and
saw
the
six
six
of
them
he
exclaimed
there
one
in
the
next
cave
the
damned
thing
spoke
to
me
i
thought
so
he
replied
you
told
it
we
have
it
for
supper
and
then
it
said
think
you
do
what
did
it
barber
face
showed
surprise
how
did
you
know
that
they
telepathic
between
one
another
he
said
the
yellow
one
there
repeated
what
the
one
you
spoke
to
heard
you
say
and
it
repeated
what
the
yellow
one
heard
me
say
it
has
to
be
telepathy
between
them
telepathy
barber
stared
at
the
six
little
animals
who
stared
back
with
their
fascinated
curiosity
undiminished
but
why
should
they
want
to
repeat
aloud
what
they
receive
telepathically
i
do
know
maybe
at
some
stage
in
their
evolution
only
part
of
them
were
telepaths
and
the
telepaths
broadcasted
danger
warnings
to
the
others
that
way
so
far
as
that
goes
why
does
a
parrot
repeat
what
it
hears
there
was
a
scurry
of
movement
behind
barber
and
another
of
the
little
animals
a
white
one
hurried
past
them
it
went
to
the
yellow
one
and
they
stood
close
together
as
they
stared
up
apparently
they
were
mates
that
the
other
one
those
are
the
two
that
mocked
us
barber
said
and
thereby
gave
them
the
name
by
which
they
would
be
known
mockers
the
mockers
were
fresh
meat
but
they
accepted
the
humans
with
such
friendliness
and
trust
that
barber
lost
all
his
desire
to
have
one
for
supper
or
for
any
other
time
they
had
a
limited
supply
of
dried
meat
and
there
would
be
plenty
of
orange
corn
they
would
not
go
hungry
they
discovered
that
the
mockers
had
living
quarters
in
both
the
cool
caves
and
the
ones
warmed
by
the
hot
springs
there
was
evidence
that
they
hibernated
during
the
winters
in
the
warm
caves
there
were
no
minerals
in
the
mockers
valley
and
they
set
out
to
continue
their
circuit
of
the
chasm
they
did
not
get
far
until
the
heat
had
become
so
great
that
the
chasm
tributaries
began
going
dry
they
turned
back
then
to
wait
in
the
little
valley
until
the
fall
rains
came
when
the
long
summer
was
ended
by
the
first
rain
they
resumed
their
journey
they
took
a
supply
of
the
orange
corn
and
two
of
the
mockers
the
yellow
one
and
its
mate
the
other
mockers
watched
them
leave
standing
silent
and
solemn
in
front
of
their
caves
as
though
they
feared
they
might
never
see
their
two
fellows
or
the
humans
again
the
two
mockers
were
pleasant
company
riding
on
their
shoulders
and
chattering
any
nonsense
that
came
to
mind
and
sometimes
saying
things
that
were
not
at
all
nonsense
making
humbolt
wonder
if
mockers
could
partly
read
human
minds
and
dimly
understand
the
meaning
of
some
of
the
things
they
said
they
found
a
place
where
saltpeter
was
very
thinly
and
erratically
distributed
they
scraped
off
all
the
films
of
it
that
were
visible
and
procured
a
small
amount
they
completed
their
circuit
and
reached
the
foot
of
the
long
steep
slope
of
the
craigs
without
finding
anything
more
it
was
an
awesome
climb
that
lay
before
them
up
a
grade
so
steep
and
barred
with
so
many
low
ledges
that
when
their
legs
refused
to
carry
them
farther
they
crawled
the
heat
was
still
very
serious
and
there
would
be
no
water
until
they
came
to
the
spring
beyond
the
summit
a
burning
wind
born
on
the
blazing
floor
of
the
chasm
followed
them
up
the
mountain
all
day
their
leather
canteens
were
almost
dry
when
night
came
and
they
were
no
more
than
a
third
of
the
way
to
the
top
the
mockers
had
become
silent
as
the
elevation
increased
and
when
they
stopped
for
the
night
humbolt
saw
that
they
would
never
live
to
cross
the
mountain
they
were
breathing
fast
their
hearts
racing
as
they
tried
to
extract
enough
oxygen
from
the
thin
air
they
drank
a
few
drops
of
water
but
they
would
not
touch
the
corn
he
offered
them
the
white
mocker
died
at
midmorning
the
next
day
as
they
stopped
for
a
rest
the
yellow
one
crawled
feebly
to
her
side
and
died
a
few
minutes
later
so
that
that
humbolt
said
looking
down
at
them
the
only
things
on
ragnarok
that
ever
trusted
us
and
wanted
to
be
our
friends
and
we
killed
them
they
drank
the
last
of
their
water
and
went
on
they
made
dry
camp
that
night
and
dreams
of
cold
streams
of
water
tormented
their
exhausted
sleep
the
next
day
was
a
hellish
eternity
in
which
they
walked
and
fell
and
crawled
and
walked
and
fell
again
barber
weakened
steadily
his
breathing
growing
to
a
rattling
panting
he
spoke
once
that
afternoon
to
try
to
smile
with
dry
swollen
lips
and
say
between
his
panting
gasps
it
would
be
hell
to
have
to
die
so
thirsty
like
this
after
that
he
fell
with
increasing
frequency
each
time
slower
and
weaker
in
getting
up
again
half
a
mile
short
of
the
summit
he
fell
for
the
last
time
he
tried
to
get
up
failed
and
tried
to
crawl
he
failed
at
that
too
and
collapsed
face
down
in
the
rocky
soil
humbolt
went
to
him
and
said
between
his
own
labored
intakes
of
breath
wait
dan
i
go
on
bring
you
back
water
barber
raised
himself
with
a
great
effort
and
looked
up
no
use
he
said
my
heart
too
much
he
fell
forward
again
and
that
time
he
was
very
still
his
desperate
panting
no
more
it
seemed
to
humbolt
that
it
was
half
a
lifetime
later
that
he
finally
reached
the
spring
and
the
cold
clear
water
he
drank
the
most
ecstatic
pleasure
he
had
ever
experienced
in
his
life
then
the
pleasure
drained
away
as
he
seemed
to
see
dan
barber
trying
to
smile
and
seemed
to
hear
him
say
it
would
be
hell
to
have
to
die
so
thirsty
like
this
he
rested
for
two
days
before
he
was
in
condition
to
continue
on
his
way
he
reached
the
plateau
and
saw
that
the
woods
goats
had
been
migrating
south
for
some
time
on
the
second
morning
he
climbed
up
a
gentle
roll
in
the
plain
and
met
three
unicorns
face
to
face
they
charged
at
once
squealing
with
anticipation
had
he
been
equipped
with
an
ordinary
bow
he
would
have
been
killed
within
seconds
but
the
automatic
crossbow
poured
a
rain
of
arrows
into
the
faces
of
the
unicorns
that
caused
them
to
swing
aside
in
pain
and
enraged
astonishment
the
moment
they
had
swung
enough
to
expose
the
area
just
behind
their
heads
the
arrows
became
fatal
one
unicorn
escaped
three
arrows
bristling
in
its
face
it
watched
him
from
a
distance
for
a
little
while
squealing
and
shaking
its
head
in
baffled
fury
then
it
turned
and
disappeared
over
a
swell
in
the
plain
running
like
a
deer
he
resumed
his
southward
march
hurrying
faster
than
before
the
unicorn
had
headed
north
and
that
could
be
for
but
one
purpose
to
bring
enough
reinforcements
to
finish
the
job
he
reached
the
caves
at
night
no
one
was
up
but
george
ord
working
late
in
his
combination
george
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
his
entrance
and
saw
that
he
was
alone
so
dan
did
make
it
he
asked
the
chasm
got
him
he
answered
and
then
wearily
the
chasm
we
found
the
damned
thing
the
red
stratum
it
was
only
iron
stains
i
made
a
little
pilot
smelter
while
you
were
gone
george
said
i
was
hoping
the
red
stratum
would
be
ore
the
other
prospecting
parties
none
of
them
found
anything
we
try
again
next
spring
he
said
we
find
it
somewhere
no
matter
how
long
it
takes
our
time
may
not
be
so
long
the
observations
show
the
sun
to
be
farther
south
than
ever
then
we
make
double
use
of
the
time
we
do
have
we
cut
the
hunting
parties
to
the
limit
and
send
out
more
prospecting
parties
we
going
to
have
a
ship
to
meet
the
gerns
again
sometimes
george
said
his
black
eyes
studying
him
thoughtfully
i
think
that
all
you
live
for
bill
for
the
day
when
you
can
kill
gerns
george
said
it
as
a
statement
of
a
fact
without
censure
but
humbolt
could
not
keep
an
edge
of
harshness
out
of
his
voice
as
he
answered
for
as
long
as
i
leader
that
all
we
all
going
to
live
for
he
followed
the
game
south
that
fall
taking
with
him
bob
craig
and
young
anders
hundreds
of
miles
south
of
the
caves
they
came
to
the
lowlands
a
land
of
much
water
and
vegetation
and
vast
herds
of
unicorns
and
woods
goats
it
was
an
exceedingly
dangerous
country
due
to
the
concentration
of
unicorns
and
prowlers
and
only
the
automatic
crossbows
combined
with
never
ceasing
vigilance
enabled
them
to
survive
there
they
saw
the
crawlers
hideous
things
that
crawled
on
multiple
legs
like
centipedes
their
mouths
set
with
six
mandibles
and
dripping
a
stinking
saliva
the
bite
of
a
crawler
was
poisonous
instantly
paralyzing
even
to
a
unicorn
though
not
instantly
killing
them
the
crawlers
ate
their
victims
at
once
however
ripping
the
helpless
and
still
living
flesh
from
its
bones
although
the
unicorns
feared
the
crawlers
the
prowlers
hated
them
with
a
fanatical
intensity
and
made
use
of
their
superior
quickness
to
kill
every
crawler
they
found
ripping
at
the
crawler
until
the
crawler
in
an
insanity
of
rage
bit
itself
and
died
of
its
own
poison
they
had
taken
one
of
the
powerful
longbows
with
them
in
addition
to
their
crossbows
and
they
killed
a
crawler
with
it
one
day
as
they
did
so
a
band
of
twenty
prowlers
came
suddenly
upon
them
twenty
prowlers
with
the
advantage
of
surprise
at
short
range
could
have
slaughtered
them
instead
the
prowlers
continued
on
their
way
without
as
much
as
a
challenging
snarl
now
why
bob
craig
wondered
did
they
do
that
they
saw
we
had
just
killed
a
crawler
humbolt
said
the
crawlers
are
their
enemies
and
i
guess
letting
us
live
was
their
way
of
showing
appreciation
their
further
explorations
of
the
lowlands
revealed
no
minerals
nothing
but
alluvial
material
of
unknown
depth
and
there
was
no
reason
to
stay
longer
except
that
return
to
the
caves
was
impossible
until
spring
came
they
built
shelters
in
the
trees
and
settled
down
to
wait
out
the
winter
they
started
north
with
the
first
wave
of
woods
goats
nothing
but
lack
of
success
to
show
for
their
months
of
time
and
effort
when
they
were
almost
to
the
caves
they
came
to
the
barren
valley
where
the
gerns
had
herded
the
rejects
out
of
the
cruisers
and
to
the
place
where
the
stockade
had
been
it
was
a
lonely
place
the
stockade
walls
fallen
and
scattered
and
the
graves
of
humbolt
mother
and
all
the
others
long
since
obliterated
by
the
hooves
of
the
unicorn
legions
bitter
memories
were
reawakened
tinged
by
the
years
with
nostalgia
and
the
stockade
was
far
behind
them
before
the
dark
mood
left
him
the
orange
corn
was
planted
that
spring
and
the
number
of
prospecting
parties
was
doubled
the
corn
sprouted
grew
feebly
and
died
before
maturity
the
prospecting
parties
returned
one
by
one
each
to
report
no
success
he
decided
that
fall
that
time
was
too
precious
to
waste
they
would
have
to
use
the
alternate
plan
he
had
spoken
of
he
went
to
george
ord
and
asked
him
if
it
would
be
possible
to
build
a
hyperspace
transmitter
with
the
materials
they
had
it
the
one
way
we
could
have
a
chance
to
leave
here
without
a
ship
of
our
own
he
said
by
luring
a
gern
cruiser
here
and
then
taking
it
away
from
them
george
shook
his
head
a
hyperspace
transmitter
be
built
given
enough
years
of
time
but
it
would
be
useless
without
power
it
would
take
a
generator
of
such
size
that
we
have
to
melt
down
every
gun
knife
axe
every
piece
of
steel
and
iron
we
have
and
then
we
be
five
hundred
pounds
short
on
top
of
that
we
have
to
have
at
least
three
hundred
pounds
more
of
copper
for
additional
wire
i
did
realize
it
would
take
such
a
large
generator
he
said
after
a
silence
i
was
sure
we
could
have
a
transmitter
get
me
the
metal
and
we
can
george
said
he
sighed
restlessly
and
there
was
almost
hatred
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
the
inclosing
walls
of
the
cave
you
not
the
only
one
who
would
like
to
leave
our
prison
get
me
eight
hundred
pounds
of
copper
and
iron
and
i
make
the
transmitter
some
way
eight
hundred
pounds
of
metal
on
ragnarok
that
was
like
asking
for
the
sun
the
years
went
by
and
each
year
there
was
the
same
determined
effort
the
same
lack
of
success
and
each
year
the
suns
were
farther
south
marking
the
coming
of
the
end
of
any
efforts
other
than
the
one
to
survive
in
the
year
thirty
when
fall
came
earlier
than
ever
before
he
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
the
bleak
and
bitter
fact
he
and
the
others
were
not
of
the
generation
that
would
escape
from
ragnarok
they
were
they
were
not
adapted
to
ragnarok
and
could
not
scour
a
world
of
gravity
for
metals
that
might
not
exist
and
vengeance
was
a
luxury
he
could
not
have
a
question
grew
in
his
mind
where
there
had
been
only
his
hatred
for
the
gerns
before
would
become
of
the
future
generations
on
ragnarok
with
the
question
a
scene
from
his
childhood
kept
coming
back
to
him
a
late
summer
evening
in
the
first
year
on
ragnarok
and
julia
sitting
beside
him
in
the
warm
starlight
you
my
son
billy
she
had
said
the
first
i
ever
had
now
before
so
very
long
maybe
i
have
another
one
hesitantly
not
wanting
to
believe
he
had
asked
what
some
of
them
said
about
how
you
might
die
then
it
wo
really
happen
will
it
julia
it
might
then
her
arm
had
gone
around
him
and
she
had
said
if
i
do
i
leave
in
my
place
a
life
that
more
important
than
mine
ever
was
remember
me
billy
and
this
evening
and
what
i
said
to
you
if
you
should
ever
be
leader
remember
that
it
only
through
the
children
that
we
can
ever
survive
and
whip
this
world
protect
them
while
small
and
helpless
and
teach
them
to
fight
and
be
afraid
of
nothing
when
they
a
little
older
never
never
let
them
forget
how
they
came
to
be
on
ragnarok
someday
even
if
it
a
hundred
years
from
now
the
gerns
will
come
again
and
they
must
be
ready
to
fight
for
their
freedom
and
for
their
lives
he
had
been
too
young
then
to
understand
how
truly
she
had
spoken
and
when
he
was
old
enough
his
hatred
for
the
gerns
had
blinded
him
to
everything
but
his
own
desires
now
he
could
see
the
children
of
each
generation
would
be
better
adapted
to
ragnarok
and
full
adaptation
would
eventually
come
but
all
the
generations
of
the
future
would
be
potential
slaves
of
the
gern
empire
free
only
so
long
as
they
remained
unnoticed
it
was
inconceivable
that
the
gerns
should
never
pass
by
ragnarok
through
all
time
to
come
and
when
they
finally
came
the
slow
uneventful
progression
of
decades
and
centuries
might
have
brought
a
false
sense
of
security
to
the
people
of
ragnarok
might
have
turned
the
stories
of
what
the
gerns
did
to
the
rejects
into
legends
and
then
into
myths
that
no
one
any
longer
believed
the
gerns
would
have
to
be
brought
to
ragnarok
before
that
could
happen
he
went
to
george
ord
again
and
said
there
one
kind
of
transmitter
we
could
make
a
generator
for
a
plain
transmitter
without
a
receiver
george
laid
down
the
diamond
cutting
wheel
he
had
been
working
on
it
would
take
two
hundred
years
for
the
signal
to
get
to
athena
at
the
speed
of
light
he
said
then
forty
days
after
it
got
there
a
gern
cruiser
would
come
to
investigate
i
want
the
ones
of
the
future
to
know
that
the
gerns
will
be
here
no
later
than
two
hundred
years
from
now
and
with
always
the
chance
that
a
gern
cruiser
in
space
might
pick
up
the
signal
at
any
time
before
then
i
see
george
said
the
sword
of
damocles
hanging
over
their
heads
to
make
them
remember
you
know
what
would
happen
to
them
if
they
ever
forgot
you
as
old
as
i
am
you
know
what
the
gerns
did
to
us
i
older
than
you
are
george
said
i
was
nine
when
the
gerns
left
us
here
they
kept
my
father
and
mother
and
my
sister
was
only
three
i
tried
to
keep
her
warm
by
holding
her
but
the
hell
fever
got
her
that
first
night
she
was
too
young
to
understand
why
i
could
help
her
more
hatred
burned
in
his
eyes
at
the
memory
like
some
fire
that
had
been
banked
but
had
never
died
yes
i
remember
the
gerns
and
what
they
did
i
would
want
it
to
have
to
happen
to
others
the
transmitter
will
be
made
so
that
it
wo
the
guns
were
melted
down
together
with
other
items
of
iron
and
steel
to
make
the
castings
for
the
generator
ceramic
pipes
were
made
to
carry
water
from
the
spring
to
a
waterwheel
the
long
slow
job
of
converting
the
miscellany
of
electronic
devices
many
of
them
broken
into
the
components
of
a
transmitter
proceeded
it
was
five
years
before
the
transmitter
was
ready
for
testing
it
was
early
fall
of
the
year
then
and
the
water
that
gushed
from
the
pipe
splashed
in
cold
drops
against
humbolt
as
the
waterwheel
was
set
in
motion
the
generator
began
to
hum
and
george
observed
the
output
of
it
and
the
transmitter
as
registered
by
the
various
meters
he
had
made
weak
but
it
will
reach
the
gern
monitor
station
on
athena
he
said
it
ready
to
send
what
do
you
want
to
say
make
it
something
short
he
said
make
it
calling
george
poised
his
finger
over
the
transmitting
key
this
will
set
forces
in
motion
that
can
never
be
recalled
what
we
do
here
this
morning
is
going
to
cause
a
lot
of
gerns
or
ragnarok
people
to
die
it
will
be
the
gerns
who
die
he
said
send
the
signal
like
you
i
believe
the
same
thing
george
said
i
have
to
believe
it
because
that
the
way
i
want
it
to
be
i
hope
we
right
something
we
never
know
he
began
depressing
the
key
a
boy
was
given
the
job
of
operating
the
key
and
the
signal
went
out
daily
until
the
freezing
of
winter
stopped
the
waterwheel
that
powered
the
generator
the
sending
of
the
signals
was
resumed
when
spring
came
and
the
prospecting
parties
continued
their
vain
search
for
metals
the
suns
continued
moving
south
and
each
year
the
springs
came
later
the
falls
earlier
in
the
spring
of
he
saw
that
he
would
have
to
make
his
final
decision
by
then
they
had
dwindled
until
they
numbered
only
the
young
ones
gray
and
rapidly
growing
old
there
was
no
longer
any
use
to
continue
the
prospecting
if
any
metals
were
to
be
found
they
were
at
the
north
end
of
the
plateau
where
the
snow
no
longer
melted
during
the
summer
they
were
too
few
to
do
more
than
prepare
for
what
the
old
ones
had
feared
they
might
have
to
face
big
winter
that
would
require
the
work
of
all
of
them
sheets
of
mica
were
brought
down
from
the
craigs
the
summits
of
which
were
deeply
buried
under
snow
even
in
midsummer
stoves
were
made
of
fireclay
and
mica
which
would
give
both
heat
and
light
and
would
be
more
efficient
than
the
open
fireplaces
the
innermost
caves
were
prepared
for
occupation
with
multiple
doors
to
hold
out
the
cold
and
with
laboriously
excavated
ventilation
ducts
and
smoke
outlets
there
were
sixty
of
them
in
the
fall
of
fifty
when
all
had
been
done
that
could
be
done
to
prepare
for
what
might
come
there
are
many
of
the
left
now
bob
craig
said
to
him
one
night
as
they
sat
in
the
flickering
light
of
a
stove
and
there
has
been
time
for
there
to
be
many
of
the
the
gerns
would
get
many
slaves
if
they
should
come
now
they
could
use
however
many
they
found
he
answered
the
younger
ones
who
are
the
best
adapted
to
this
gravity
would
be
exceptionally
strong
and
quick
on
a
world
there
are
dangerous
jobs
where
a
strong
quick
slave
is
a
lot
more
efficient
and
expendable
than
complex
expensive
machines
and
they
would
want
some
specimens
for
scientific
study
jim
lake
said
they
would
want
to
cut
into
the
young
ones
and
see
how
built
that
they
adapted
to
this
one
and
a
half
gravity
world
he
smiled
with
the
cold
mirthlessness
that
always
reminded
humbolt
of
his
father
of
the
lake
who
had
been
the
lieutenant
commander
according
to
the
books
the
gerns
never
did
try
to
make
it
a
secret
that
when
a
gern
doctor
or
biologist
cuts
into
the
muscles
or
organs
of
a
to
see
what
makes
them
tick
he
wants
them
to
be
still
alive
and
ticking
as
he
does
so
don
chiara
spoke
to
say
slowly
thoughtfully
slavery
and
vivisection
if
the
gerns
should
come
now
when
there
are
so
few
of
us
and
if
we
should
fight
the
best
we
could
and
lose
it
would
be
better
for
whoever
was
the
last
of
us
left
to
put
a
knife
in
the
hearts
of
the
women
and
children
than
to
let
the
gerns
have
them
no
one
made
any
answer
there
was
no
answer
to
make
no
alternative
to
suggest
in
the
future
there
will
be
more
of
us
and
it
will
be
different
he
said
at
last
on
earth
the
gerns
were
always
stronger
and
faster
than
humans
but
when
the
gerns
come
to
ragnarok
they
going
to
find
a
race
that
is
really
human
any
more
they
going
to
find
a
race
before
which
they
be
like
woods
goats
before
prowlers
if
only
they
do
come
too
soon
craig
said
that
was
the
chance
that
had
to
be
taken
he
replied
he
wondered
again
as
he
spoke
as
he
had
wondered
so
often
in
the
past
years
if
he
had
given
them
all
their
death
sentence
when
he
ordered
the
transmitter
built
yet
the
future
generations
could
not
be
permitted
to
forget
and
steel
could
not
be
tempered
without
first
thrusting
it
into
the
fire
he
was
the
last
of
the
young
ones
when
he
awoke
one
night
in
the
fall
of
and
found
himself
burning
with
the
hell
fever
he
did
not
summon
any
of
the
others
they
could
do
nothing
for
him
and
he
had
already
done
all
he
could
for
them
he
had
done
all
he
could
for
them
and
now
he
would
leave
men
women
and
children
to
face
the
unknown
forces
of
big
winter
while
over
them
hung
the
sword
he
had
forged
the
increasing
danger
of
detection
by
the
gerns
the
question
came
again
sharp
with
the
knowledge
that
it
was
far
too
late
for
him
to
change
any
of
it
i
arrange
the
execution
of
my
people
then
through
the
red
haze
of
the
fever
julia
spoke
to
him
out
of
the
past
sitting
again
beside
him
in
the
summer
twilight
and
saying
me
billy
and
this
evening
and
what
i
said
to
you
teach
them
to
fight
and
be
afraid
of
nothing
never
let
them
forget
how
they
came
to
be
on
ragnarok
she
seemed
very
near
and
real
and
the
doubt
faded
and
was
gone
them
to
fight
never
let
them
forget
the
men
of
ragnarok
were
only
hunters
who
crouched
in
caves
but
they
would
grow
in
numbers
as
time
went
by
each
generation
would
be
stronger
than
the
generation
before
it
and
he
had
set
forces
in
motion
that
would
bring
the
last
generation
the
trial
of
combat
and
the
opportunity
for
freedom
how
well
they
fought
on
that
day
would
determine
their
destiny
but
he
was
certain
once
again
what
that
destiny
would
be
it
would
be
to
walk
as
conquerors
before
beaten
and
humbled
gerns
it
was
winter
of
the
year
and
the
temperature
was
one
hundred
and
six
degrees
below
zero
walter
humbolt
stood
in
front
of
the
ice
tunnel
that
led
back
through
the
glacier
to
the
caves
and
looked
up
into
the
sky
it
was
noon
but
there
was
no
sun
in
the
starlit
sky
many
weeks
before
the
sun
had
slipped
below
the
southern
horizon
for
a
little
while
a
dim
halo
had
marked
its
passage
each
day
then
that
too
had
faded
away
but
now
it
was
time
for
the
halo
to
appear
again
to
herald
the
returning
frost
filled
the
sky
making
the
stars
flicker
as
it
swirled
endlessly
downward
he
blinked
against
it
his
eyelashes
trying
to
freeze
to
his
lower
eyelids
at
the
movement
and
turned
to
look
at
the
north
there
the
northern
lights
were
a
gigantic
curtain
that
filled
a
third
of
the
sky
rippling
and
waving
in
folds
that
pulsated
in
red
and
green
rose
and
lavender
and
violet
their
reflection
gleamed
on
the
glacier
that
sloped
down
from
the
caves
and
glowed
softly
on
the
other
glacier
the
one
that
covered
the
transmitter
station
the
transmitter
had
long
ago
been
taken
into
the
caves
but
the
generator
and
waterwheel
were
still
there
frozen
in
a
tomb
of
ice
for
three
years
the
glacier
had
been
growing
before
the
caves
and
the
plateau
southern
face
had
been
buried
under
snow
for
ten
years
only
a
few
woods
goats
ever
came
as
far
north
as
the
country
south
of
the
caves
and
they
stayed
only
during
the
brief
period
between
the
last
snow
of
spring
and
the
first
snow
of
fall
their
winter
home
was
somewhere
down
near
the
equator
what
had
been
called
the
southern
lowlands
was
a
frozen
lifeless
waste
once
they
had
thought
about
going
to
the
valley
in
the
chasm
where
the
mockers
would
be
hibernating
in
their
warm
caves
but
even
if
they
could
have
gone
up
the
plateau
and
performed
the
incredible
feat
of
crossing
the
craigs
they
would
have
found
no
food
in
the
mockers
valley
only
a
little
corn
the
mockers
had
stored
away
which
would
soon
have
been
exhausted
there
was
no
place
for
them
to
live
but
in
the
caves
or
as
nomads
migrating
with
the
animals
and
if
they
migrated
to
the
equator
each
year
they
would
have
to
leave
behind
them
all
the
books
and
tools
and
everything
that
might
someday
have
given
them
a
civilized
way
of
life
and
might
someday
have
shown
them
how
to
escape
from
their
prison
he
looked
again
to
the
south
where
the
halo
should
be
thinking
should
have
made
their
decision
in
there
by
now
i
their
leader
but
i
ca
force
them
to
stay
here
against
their
will
i
could
only
ask
them
to
consider
what
it
would
mean
if
we
left
snow
creaked
underfoot
as
he
moved
restlessly
he
saw
something
lying
under
the
blanket
of
frost
and
went
to
it
it
was
an
arrow
that
someone
had
dropped
he
picked
it
up
carefully
because
the
intense
cold
had
made
the
shaft
as
brittle
as
glass
it
would
regain
its
normal
strength
when
taken
into
the
caves
there
was
the
sound
of
steps
and
fred
schroeder
came
out
of
the
tunnel
dressed
as
he
was
dressed
in
bulky
furs
schroeder
looked
to
the
south
and
said
it
seems
to
be
starting
to
get
a
little
lighter
there
he
saw
that
it
was
a
small
faint
paling
of
the
black
sky
they
talked
over
what
you
and
i
told
them
schroeder
said
and
about
how
we
struggled
to
stay
here
this
long
and
how
even
if
the
sun
should
stop
drifting
south
this
year
it
will
be
years
of
ice
and
cold
at
the
caves
before
big
spring
comes
if
we
leave
here
the
glacier
will
cover
the
caves
and
fill
them
with
ice
he
said
all
we
ever
had
will
be
buried
back
in
there
and
all
we
have
left
will
be
our
bows
and
arrows
and
animal
skins
we
be
taking
a
road
back
into
the
stone
age
for
ourselves
and
our
children
and
their
children
they
know
that
schroeder
said
we
both
told
them
he
paused
they
watched
the
sky
to
the
south
turn
lighter
the
northern
lights
flamed
unnoticed
behind
them
as
the
pale
halo
of
the
invisible
sun
slowly
brightened
to
its
maximum
their
faces
were
white
with
then
and
they
turned
to
go
back
into
the
caves
they
had
made
their
decision
schroeder
went
on
i
guess
you
and
i
did
them
an
injustice
when
we
thought
they
had
lost
their
determination
when
we
thought
they
might
want
to
hand
their
children
a
flint
axe
and
say
take
this
and
let
it
be
the
symbol
of
all
you
are
or
all
you
will
ever
be
their
decision
was
unanimous
we
stay
for
as
long
as
it
possible
for
us
to
survive
here
howard
lake
listened
to
teacher
morgan
west
read
from
the
diary
of
walter
humbolt
written
during
the
terrible
winter
of
years
before
each
morning
the
light
to
the
south
was
brighter
on
the
seventh
morning
we
saw
the
sun
and
it
was
not
due
until
the
eighth
morning
it
will
be
years
before
we
can
stop
fighting
the
enclosure
of
the
glacier
but
we
have
reached
and
passed
the
dead
of
big
winter
we
have
reached
the
bottom
and
the
only
direction
we
can
go
in
the
future
is
and
so
west
said
closing
the
book
we
are
here
in
the
caves
tonight
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
humbolt
and
schroeder
and
all
the
others
had
they
thought
only
of
their
own
welfare
had
they
conceded
defeat
and
gone
into
the
migratory
way
of
life
we
would
be
sitting
beside
grass
campfires
somewhere
to
the
south
tonight
our
way
of
life
containing
no
plans
or
aspirations
greater
than
to
follow
the
game
back
and
forth
through
the
years
now
let
go
outside
to
finish
tonight
lesson
teacher
west
led
the
way
into
the
starlit
night
just
outside
the
caves
howard
lake
and
the
other
children
following
him
west
pointed
to
the
sky
where
the
star
group
they
called
the
athena
constellation
blazed
like
a
huge
arrowhead
high
in
the
east
there
he
said
beyond
the
top
of
the
arrowhead
is
where
we
were
going
when
the
gerns
stopped
us
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
ago
and
left
us
to
die
on
ragnarok
it
so
far
that
athena
sun
ca
be
seen
from
here
so
far
that
it
will
be
another
hundred
and
fifteen
years
before
our
first
signal
gets
there
why
is
it
then
that
you
and
all
the
other
groups
of
children
have
to
learn
such
things
as
history
physics
the
gern
language
and
the
way
to
fire
a
gern
blaster
the
hand
of
every
child
went
up
west
selected
clifton
humbolt
tell
us
clifton
he
said
because
clifton
answered
a
gern
cruiser
might
pass
by
a
few
out
at
any
time
and
pick
up
our
signals
so
we
have
to
know
all
we
can
about
them
and
how
to
fight
them
because
there
are
very
many
of
us
yet
the
gerns
will
come
to
kill
us
little
marie
chiara
said
her
dark
eyes
large
and
earnest
they
come
to
kill
us
and
to
make
slaves
out
of
the
ones
they
do
kill
like
they
did
with
the
others
a
long
time
ago
they
awful
mean
and
awful
smart
and
we
have
to
be
smarter
than
they
are
howard
looked
again
at
the
athena
constellation
thinking
hope
they
come
just
as
soon
as
i
old
enough
to
fight
them
or
even
tonight
teacher
he
asked
how
would
a
gern
cruiser
look
if
it
came
tonight
would
it
come
from
the
athena
arrowhead
it
probably
would
west
answered
you
would
see
its
rocket
blast
like
a
bright
trail
of
fire
a
bright
trail
of
fire
burst
suddenly
into
being
coming
from
the
constellation
of
athena
and
lighting
up
the
woods
and
hills
and
their
startled
faces
as
it
arced
down
toward
them
it
them
a
treble
voice
exclaimed
and
there
was
a
quick
flurry
of
movement
as
howard
and
the
other
older
children
shoved
the
younger
children
behind
them
then
the
light
vanished
leaving
a
dimming
glow
where
it
had
been
only
a
meteor
west
said
he
looked
at
the
line
of
older
children
who
were
standing
protectingly
in
front
of
the
younger
ones
rocks
in
their
hands
with
which
to
ward
off
the
gerns
and
he
smiled
in
the
way
he
had
when
he
was
pleased
with
them
howard
watched
the
meteor
trail
fade
swiftly
into
invisibility
and
felt
his
heartbeats
slow
from
the
first
wild
thrill
to
gray
disappointment
only
a
meteor
but
someday
he
might
be
leader
and
by
then
surely
the
gerns
would
come
if
not
he
would
find
some
way
to
make
them
come
ten
years
later
howard
lake
was
leader
there
were
three
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
then
and
big
spring
was
on
its
way
to
becoming
big
summer
the
snow
was
gone
from
the
southern
end
of
the
plateau
and
once
again
game
migrated
up
the
valleys
east
of
the
caves
there
were
many
things
to
be
done
now
that
big
winter
was
past
and
they
could
have
the
chance
to
do
them
they
needed
a
larger
pottery
kiln
a
larger
workshop
with
a
wooden
lathe
more
diamonds
to
make
cutting
wheels
more
quartz
crystals
to
make
binoculars
and
microscopes
they
could
again
explore
the
field
of
inorganic
chemistry
even
though
results
in
the
past
had
produced
nothing
of
value
and
they
could
within
a
few
years
resume
the
metal
prospecting
up
the
plateau
the
most
important
project
of
all
their
weapons
seemed
to
be
as
perfect
as
was
possible
but
when
the
gerns
came
they
would
need
some
quick
and
certain
means
of
communication
between
the
various
units
that
would
fight
the
gerns
a
leader
who
could
not
communicate
with
his
forces
and
coordinate
their
actions
would
be
helpless
and
they
had
on
ragnarok
a
form
of
communication
if
trained
that
the
gerns
could
not
detect
or
interfere
with
electronically
the
mockers
the
craigs
were
still
white
and
impassable
with
snow
that
summer
but
the
snow
was
receding
higher
each
year
five
years
later
in
the
summer
of
one
hundred
and
the
craigs
were
passable
for
a
few
weeks
lake
led
a
party
of
eight
over
them
and
down
into
the
chasm
they
took
with
them
two
small
cages
constructed
of
wood
and
glass
and
made
airtight
with
the
strong
medusabush
glue
each
cage
was
equipped
with
a
simple
air
pump
and
a
pressure
gauge
they
brought
back
two
pairs
of
mockers
as
interested
and
trusting
captives
together
with
a
supply
of
the
orange
corn
and
a
large
amount
of
diamonds
the
mockers
in
their
cages
were
not
even
aware
of
the
increase
in
elevation
as
they
were
carried
over
the
high
summit
of
the
craigs
to
lake
and
the
men
with
him
the
climb
back
up
the
long
steep
slope
of
the
mountain
was
a
stiff
climb
to
make
in
one
day
but
no
more
than
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
it
had
taken
humbolt
and
barber
almost
three
days
to
climb
it
and
that
barber
had
died
in
the
attempt
it
reminded
him
of
the
old
crossbows
that
humbolt
and
the
others
had
used
they
were
thin
with
a
light
pull
such
as
the
present
generation
boys
used
it
must
have
required
courage
for
the
old
ones
to
dare
unicorn
attacks
with
bows
so
thin
that
only
the
small
area
behind
the
unicorn
jaws
was
vulnerable
to
their
arrows
when
the
caves
were
reached
a
very
gradual
reduction
of
pressure
in
the
mocker
cages
was
started
one
that
would
cover
a
period
of
weeks
one
pair
of
mockers
survived
and
had
two
young
ones
that
fall
the
young
mockers
like
the
first
generation
of
children
of
many
years
before
were
more
adapted
to
their
environment
than
their
parents
were
the
orange
corn
was
planted
using
an
adaptation
method
somewhat
similar
to
that
used
with
the
mockers
it
might
have
worked
had
the
orange
corn
not
required
such
a
long
period
of
time
in
which
to
reach
maturity
when
winter
came
only
a
few
grains
had
formed
they
were
saved
for
next
year
seeds
to
continue
the
slow
adaptation
process
by
the
fifth
year
the
youngest
generation
of
mockers
was
well
adapted
to
the
elevation
of
the
caves
but
for
a
susceptibility
to
a
quickly
fatal
form
of
pneumonia
which
made
it
necessary
to
keep
them
from
exposing
themselves
to
the
cold
or
to
any
sudden
changes
of
temperature
their
intelligence
was
surprising
and
they
seemed
to
be
partially
receptive
to
human
thoughts
as
bill
humbolt
had
written
by
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
year
their
training
had
reached
such
a
stage
of
perfection
that
a
mocker
would
transmit
or
not
transmit
with
only
the
unspoken
thought
of
its
master
to
tell
it
which
it
should
be
in
addition
they
would
transmit
the
message
to
whichever
mocker
their
master
thought
directed
presumably
all
mockers
received
the
message
but
only
the
mocker
to
whom
it
was
addressed
would
repeat
it
aloud
they
had
their
method
of
communication
they
had
their
automatic
crossbows
for
quick
close
fighting
and
their
long
range
longbows
they
were
fully
adapted
to
the
gravity
and
their
reflexes
were
almost
like
those
of
prowlers
ragnarok
had
long
ago
separated
the
quick
from
the
dead
there
were
eight
hundred
and
nineteen
of
them
that
year
in
the
early
spring
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
they
were
ready
and
impatient
for
the
coming
of
the
gerns
then
the
transmitter
which
had
been
in
operation
again
for
many
years
failed
one
day
george
craig
had
finished
checking
it
when
lake
arrived
he
looked
up
from
his
instruments
remarkably
similar
in
appearance
to
a
sketch
of
the
old
george
ord
a
resemblance
that
had
been
passed
down
to
him
by
his
mother
and
said
the
entire
circuit
is
either
gone
or
ready
to
go
it
already
operated
for
a
lot
longer
than
it
should
have
it
does
matter
lake
said
it
served
its
purpose
we
rebuild
it
george
watched
him
questioningly
it
served
its
purpose
he
said
again
it
did
let
us
forget
that
the
gerns
will
come
again
but
that
is
enough
now
the
first
signal
wo
reach
athena
until
the
year
two
it
will
be
the
dead
of
big
winter
again
then
they
have
to
fight
the
gerns
with
bows
and
arrows
that
the
cold
will
make
as
brittle
as
glass
they
wo
have
a
chance
no
george
said
they
wo
have
a
chance
but
what
can
we
do
to
change
it
it
something
i
been
thinking
about
he
said
we
build
a
hyperspace
transmitter
and
bring
the
gerns
before
big
winter
comes
we
will
george
asked
lifting
his
dark
eyebrows
and
what
do
we
use
for
the
three
hundred
pounds
of
copper
and
five
hundred
pounds
of
iron
we
would
have
to
have
to
make
the
generator
surely
we
can
find
five
hundred
pounds
of
iron
somewhere
on
ragnarok
the
north
end
of
the
plateau
might
be
the
best
bet
as
for
the
copper
i
doubt
that
we
ever
find
it
but
there
are
seams
of
a
clay
in
the
western
hills
they
certain
to
contain
aluminum
to
at
least
some
extent
so
we
make
the
wires
of
aluminum
the
ore
would
have
to
be
refined
to
pure
aluminum
oxide
before
it
could
be
smelted
george
said
and
you
ca
smelt
aluminum
ore
in
an
ordinary
furnace
only
in
an
electric
furnace
with
a
generator
that
can
supply
a
high
amperage
and
we
would
have
to
have
cryolite
ore
to
serve
as
the
solvent
in
the
smelting
process
there
a
seam
of
cryolite
in
the
eastern
hills
according
to
the
old
maps
said
lake
we
could
make
a
larger
generator
by
melting
down
everything
we
have
it
would
be
big
enough
to
power
the
hyperspace
transmitter
but
it
should
be
big
enough
to
smelt
aluminum
george
considered
the
idea
i
think
we
can
do
it
how
long
until
we
can
send
the
signal
he
asked
given
the
extra
metal
we
need
the
building
of
the
generator
is
a
simple
job
the
transmitter
is
what
will
take
years
maybe
as
long
as
fifty
years
ca
anything
be
done
to
make
it
sooner
he
asked
i
know
george
said
you
would
like
for
the
gerns
to
come
while
you
still
here
so
would
every
man
on
ragnarok
but
even
on
earth
the
building
of
a
hyperspace
transmitter
was
a
long
slow
job
with
all
the
materials
they
needed
and
all
the
special
tools
and
equipment
here
we
have
to
do
everything
by
hand
and
for
materials
we
have
only
broken
and
odds
and
ends
it
will
take
about
fifty
years
it
ca
be
helped
fifty
years
but
that
would
bring
the
gerns
before
big
winter
came
again
and
there
was
the
rapidly
increasing
chance
that
a
gern
cruiser
would
at
any
day
intercept
the
first
signals
they
were
already
more
than
halfway
to
athena
melt
down
the
generator
he
said
start
making
a
bigger
one
tomorrow
men
will
go
out
after
bauxite
and
cryolite
and
four
of
us
will
go
up
the
plateau
to
look
for
iron
lake
selected
gene
taylor
tony
chiara
and
steve
schroeder
to
go
with
him
they
were
well
on
their
way
by
daylight
the
next
morning
on
the
shoulder
of
each
of
them
a
mocker
which
observed
the
activity
and
new
scenes
with
bright
interested
eyes
they
traveled
light
since
they
would
have
fresh
meat
all
the
way
and
carried
herbs
and
corn
only
for
the
mockers
once
generations
before
it
had
been
necessary
for
men
to
eat
herbs
to
prevent
deficiency
diseases
but
now
the
deficiency
diseases
like
hell
fever
were
unknown
to
them
they
carried
no
compasses
since
the
radiations
of
the
two
suns
constantly
created
magnetic
storms
that
caused
compass
needles
to
swing
as
much
as
twenty
degrees
within
an
hour
each
of
them
carried
a
pair
of
powerful
binoculars
however
binoculars
that
had
been
from
the
black
unicorn
horn
and
set
with
lenses
and
prisms
of
quartz
the
foremost
bands
of
woods
goats
followed
the
advance
of
spring
up
the
plateau
and
they
followed
the
woods
goats
they
could
not
go
ahead
of
the
goats
the
goats
were
already
pressing
close
behind
the
melting
of
the
snow
no
hills
or
ridges
were
seen
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
it
seemed
to
lake
that
they
would
walk
forever
across
the
endless
rolling
floor
of
the
plain
early
summer
came
and
they
walked
across
a
land
that
was
green
and
pleasantly
cool
at
a
time
when
the
vegetation
around
the
caves
would
be
burned
brown
and
lifeless
the
woods
goats
grew
less
in
number
then
as
some
of
them
stopped
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
in
their
chosen
latitudes
they
continued
on
and
at
last
they
saw
far
to
the
north
what
seemed
to
be
an
almost
infinitesimal
bulge
on
the
horizon
they
reached
it
two
days
later
a
land
of
rolling
green
hills
scarred
here
and
there
with
ragged
outcroppings
of
rock
and
a
land
that
climbed
slowly
and
steadily
higher
as
it
went
into
the
north
they
camped
that
night
in
a
little
vale
the
floor
of
it
was
white
with
the
bones
of
woods
goats
that
had
tarried
too
long
the
fall
before
and
got
caught
by
an
early
blizzard
there
was
still
flesh
on
the
bones
and
scavenger
rodents
scuttled
among
the
carcasses
feasting
we
split
up
now
he
told
the
others
the
next
morning
he
assigned
each
of
them
his
position
steve
schroeder
to
parallel
his
course
thirty
miles
to
his
right
gene
taylor
to
go
thirty
miles
to
his
left
and
tony
chiara
to
go
thirty
miles
to
the
left
of
taylor
we
try
to
hold
those
distances
he
said
we
ca
look
over
the
country
in
detail
that
way
but
it
will
give
us
a
good
general
survey
of
it
we
do
have
too
much
time
left
by
now
and
we
make
as
many
miles
into
the
north
as
we
can
each
day
the
woods
goats
will
tell
us
when
it
time
for
us
to
turn
back
they
parted
company
with
casual
farewells
but
for
steve
schroeder
who
smiled
sardonically
at
the
bones
of
the
woods
goats
in
the
vale
and
asked
who
supposed
to
tell
the
woods
goats
tip
the
black
mocker
on
lake
shoulder
kept
twisting
his
neck
to
watch
the
departure
of
the
others
until
he
had
crossed
the
next
hill
and
the
others
were
hidden
from
view
all
right
tip
he
said
then
you
can
unwind
your
neck
now
unwind
all
right
all
right
tip
said
then
with
a
sudden
burst
of
energy
which
was
characteristic
of
mockers
he
began
to
jiggle
up
and
down
and
chant
in
time
with
his
movements
all
right
all
right
all
right
all
right
shut
up
he
commanded
if
you
want
to
talk
nonsense
i
do
care
but
do
say
right
any
more
all
right
tip
agreed
amiably
settling
down
shut
up
if
you
want
to
talk
nonsense
i
do
care
and
do
slaughter
the
punctuation
like
that
you
change
the
meaning
entirely
but
do
say
all
right
any
more
tip
went
on
ignoring
him
you
change
the
meaning
entirely
then
with
another
surge
of
animation
tip
began
to
fish
in
his
jacket
pocket
with
little
paws
tip
hungry
tip
hungry
lake
unbuttoned
the
pocket
and
gave
tip
a
herb
leaf
i
notice
no
nonsensical
chatter
when
you
want
to
ask
for
something
to
eat
tip
took
the
herb
leaf
but
he
spoke
again
before
he
began
to
eat
slowly
as
though
trying
seriously
to
express
a
thought
tip
hungry
no
nonsensical
sometimes
he
said
turning
his
head
to
look
at
tip
you
mockers
give
me
the
peculiar
feeling
that
you
right
on
the
edge
of
becoming
a
new
and
intelligent
race
and
no
fooling
tip
wiggled
his
whiskers
and
bit
into
the
herb
leaf
no
fooling
he
agreed
he
stopped
for
the
night
in
a
hollow
and
built
a
small
fire
of
dead
moss
and
grass
to
ward
off
the
chill
that
came
with
dark
he
called
the
others
thinking
first
of
schroeder
so
that
tip
would
transmit
to
schroeder
mocker
steve
here
tip
answered
in
a
detectable
imitation
of
schroeder
voice
no
luck
he
thought
of
gene
taylor
and
called
gene
there
was
no
answer
and
he
called
chiara
tony
could
you
see
any
of
gene
route
today
part
of
it
chiara
answered
i
saw
a
herd
of
unicorns
over
that
way
why
does
he
answer
no
then
chiara
said
they
must
have
got
him
did
you
find
anything
today
tony
he
asked
nothing
but
pure
andesite
not
even
an
iron
stain
it
was
the
same
kind
of
barren
formation
that
he
himself
had
been
walking
over
all
day
but
he
had
not
expected
success
so
soon
he
tried
once
again
to
call
gene
taylor
gene
gene
are
you
there
gene
there
was
no
answer
he
knew
there
would
never
be
the
days
became
weeks
with
dismaying
swiftness
as
they
penetrated
farther
into
the
north
the
hills
became
more
rugged
and
there
were
intrusions
of
granite
and
other
formations
to
promise
a
chance
of
finding
metal
a
promise
that
urged
them
on
faster
as
their
time
grew
shorter
twice
he
saw
something
white
in
the
distance
once
it
was
the
bones
of
another
band
of
woods
goats
that
had
huddled
together
and
frozen
to
death
in
some
early
blizzard
of
the
past
and
once
it
was
the
bones
of
a
dozen
unicorns
the
nights
grew
chillier
and
the
suns
moved
faster
and
faster
to
the
south
the
animals
began
to
migrate
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
in
the
beginning
but
one
that
increased
each
day
the
first
frost
came
and
the
migration
began
in
earnest
by
the
third
day
it
was
a
hurrying
tide
tip
was
strangely
silent
that
day
he
did
not
speak
until
the
noon
sun
had
cleared
the
cold
heavy
mists
of
morning
when
he
spoke
it
was
to
give
a
message
from
chiara
howard
last
report
goldie
is
dying
pneumonia
goldie
was
chiara
mocker
his
only
means
of
communication
and
there
would
be
no
way
to
tell
him
when
they
were
turning
back
turn
back
today
tony
he
said
steve
and
i
will
go
on
for
a
few
days
more
there
was
no
answer
and
he
said
quickly
turn
back
turn
back
acknowledge
that
tony
turning
back
the
acknowledgment
came
tried
to
save
her
the
message
stopped
and
there
was
a
silence
that
chiara
mocker
would
never
break
again
he
walked
on
with
tip
sitting
very
small
and
quiet
on
his
shoulder
he
had
crossed
another
hill
before
tip
moved
to
press
up
close
to
him
the
way
mockers
did
when
they
were
lonely
and
to
hold
tightly
to
him
what
is
it
tip
he
asked
goldie
is
dying
tip
said
and
then
again
like
a
soft
sad
whisper
goldie
is
dying
she
was
your
mate
i
sorry
tip
made
a
little
whimpering
sound
and
the
man
reached
up
to
stroke
his
silky
side
i
sorry
he
said
again
i
sorry
as
hell
little
fellow
for
two
days
tip
sat
lonely
and
silent
on
his
shoulder
no
longer
interested
in
the
new
scenes
nor
any
longer
relieving
the
monotony
with
his
chatter
he
refused
to
eat
until
the
morning
of
the
third
day
by
then
the
exodus
of
woods
goats
and
unicorns
had
dwindled
to
almost
nothing
the
sky
a
leaden
gray
through
which
the
sun
could
not
be
seen
that
evening
he
saw
what
he
was
sure
would
be
the
last
band
of
woods
goats
and
shot
one
of
them
when
he
went
to
it
he
was
almost
afraid
to
believe
what
he
saw
the
hair
above
its
feet
was
red
discolored
with
the
stain
of
clay
he
examined
it
more
closely
and
saw
that
the
goat
had
apparently
watered
at
a
spring
where
the
mud
was
material
washed
down
from
an
vein
or
formation
it
had
done
so
fairly
recently
there
were
still
tiny
particles
of
clay
adhering
to
the
hair
the
wind
stirred
cold
and
damp
with
its
warning
of
an
approaching
storm
he
looked
to
the
north
where
the
evening
had
turned
the
gray
clouds
black
and
called
schroeder
steve
any
luck
none
schroeder
answered
i
just
killed
a
goat
he
said
it
has
iron
stains
on
its
legs
it
got
at
some
spring
farther
north
i
going
on
to
try
to
find
it
you
can
turn
back
in
the
morning
no
schroeder
objected
i
can
angle
over
and
catch
up
with
you
in
a
couple
of
days
you
turn
back
in
the
morning
he
said
i
going
to
try
to
find
this
iron
but
if
i
get
caught
by
a
blizzard
it
will
be
up
to
you
to
tell
them
at
the
caves
that
i
found
iron
and
to
tell
them
where
it
is
you
know
the
mockers
ca
transmit
that
far
there
was
a
short
silence
then
schroeder
said
all
right
i
see
head
south
in
the
morning
lake
took
a
route
the
next
day
that
would
most
likely
be
the
one
the
woods
goats
had
come
down
stopping
on
each
ridge
top
to
study
the
country
ahead
of
him
through
his
binoculars
it
was
cloudy
all
day
but
at
sunset
the
sun
appeared
very
briefly
to
send
its
last
rays
across
the
hills
and
redden
them
in
mockery
of
the
iron
he
sought
far
ahead
of
him
small
even
through
the
glasses
and
made
visible
only
because
of
the
position
of
the
sun
was
a
spot
at
the
base
of
a
hill
that
was
redder
than
the
sunset
had
made
the
other
hills
he
was
confident
it
would
be
the
red
clay
he
was
searching
for
and
he
hurried
on
not
stopping
until
darkness
made
further
progress
impossible
tip
slept
inside
his
jacket
curled
up
against
his
chest
while
the
wind
blew
raw
and
cold
all
through
the
night
he
was
on
his
way
again
at
the
first
touch
of
daylight
the
sky
darker
than
ever
and
the
wind
spinning
random
flakes
of
snow
before
him
he
stopped
to
look
back
to
the
south
once
thinking
i
turn
back
now
i
might
get
out
before
the
blizzard
then
the
other
thought
came
hills
all
look
the
same
it
i
go
to
the
iron
while
i
this
close
and
know
where
it
is
it
might
be
years
before
i
or
anyone
else
could
find
it
he
went
on
and
did
not
look
back
again
for
the
rest
of
the
day
by
midafternoon
the
higher
hills
around
him
were
hidden
under
the
clouds
and
the
snow
was
coming
harder
and
faster
as
the
wind
drove
the
flakes
against
his
face
it
began
to
snow
with
a
heaviness
that
brought
a
half
darkness
when
he
came
finally
to
the
hill
he
had
seen
through
the
glasses
a
spring
was
at
the
base
of
it
bubbling
out
of
red
clay
above
it
the
red
dirt
led
a
hundred
feet
to
a
dike
of
granite
and
stopped
he
hurried
up
the
hillside
that
was
rapidly
whitening
with
snow
and
saw
the
vein
it
set
against
the
dike
short
and
narrow
but
with
the
iron
it
contained
he
picked
up
a
piece
and
felt
the
weight
of
it
it
was
heavy
it
was
pure
iron
oxide
he
called
schroeder
and
asked
are
you
down
out
of
the
high
hills
steve
i
in
the
lower
ones
schroeder
answered
the
words
coming
a
little
muffled
from
where
tip
lay
inside
his
jacket
it
looks
black
as
hell
up
your
way
i
found
the
iron
steve
listen
these
are
the
nearest
to
landmarks
i
can
give
you
when
he
had
finished
he
said
that
the
best
i
can
do
you
ca
see
the
red
clay
except
when
the
sun
is
low
in
the
southwest
but
i
going
to
build
a
monument
on
top
of
the
hill
to
find
it
by
about
you
howard
steve
asked
what
are
your
chances
the
wind
was
rising
to
a
high
moaning
around
the
ledges
of
the
granite
dike
and
the
vein
was
already
invisible
under
the
snow
it
does
look
like
they
very
good
he
answered
you
probably
be
leader
when
you
come
back
next
spring
i
told
the
council
i
wanted
that
if
anything
happened
to
me
keep
things
going
the
way
i
would
have
now
i
have
to
hurry
to
get
the
monument
built
in
time
all
right
schroeder
said
so
long
howard
good
luck
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
saw
boulders
there
he
could
use
to
build
the
monument
they
were
large
he
might
crush
tip
against
his
chest
in
picking
them
up
and
he
took
off
his
jacket
to
wrap
it
around
tip
and
leave
him
lying
on
the
ground
he
worked
until
he
was
panting
for
breath
the
wind
driving
the
snow
harder
and
harder
against
him
until
the
cold
seemed
to
have
penetrated
to
the
bone
he
worked
until
the
monument
was
too
high
for
his
numb
hands
to
lift
any
more
boulders
to
its
top
by
then
it
was
tall
enough
that
it
should
serve
its
purpose
he
went
back
to
look
for
tip
the
ground
already
four
inches
deep
in
snow
and
the
darkness
almost
complete
tip
he
called
tip
tip
he
walked
back
and
forth
across
the
hillside
in
the
area
where
he
thought
he
had
left
him
stumbling
over
rocks
buried
in
the
snow
and
invisible
in
the
darkness
calling
against
the
wind
and
thinking
ca
leave
him
to
die
alone
then
from
a
bulge
he
had
not
seen
in
the
snow
under
him
there
came
a
frightened
lonely
wail
tip
cold
tip
cold
he
raked
the
snow
off
his
jacket
and
unwrapped
tip
to
put
him
inside
his
shirt
next
to
his
bare
skin
tip
paws
were
like
ice
and
he
was
shivering
violently
the
first
symptom
of
the
pneumonia
that
killed
mockers
so
quickly
tip
coughed
a
wrenching
rattling
little
sound
and
whimpered
hurt
hurt
i
know
he
said
your
lungs
hurt
damn
it
to
hell
i
wish
i
could
have
let
you
go
home
with
steve
he
put
on
the
cold
jacket
and
went
down
the
hill
there
was
nothing
with
which
he
could
make
a
fire
only
the
short
grass
already
buried
under
the
snow
he
turned
south
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
determining
the
direction
by
the
wind
and
began
the
stubborn
march
southward
that
could
have
but
one
ending
he
walked
until
his
legs
would
carry
him
no
farther
the
snow
was
warm
when
he
fell
for
the
last
time
warm
and
soft
as
it
drifted
over
him
and
his
mind
was
clouded
with
a
pleasant
drowsiness
is
so
he
thought
and
there
was
something
like
surprise
through
the
drowsiness
ca
regret
doing
what
i
had
to
do
doing
it
the
best
i
could
tip
was
no
longer
coughing
and
the
thought
of
tip
was
the
only
one
that
was
tinged
with
regret
hope
he
was
still
hurting
when
he
he
felt
tip
still
very
feebly
against
his
chest
then
and
he
did
not
know
if
it
was
his
imagination
or
if
in
that
last
dreamlike
state
it
was
tip
thought
that
came
to
him
warm
and
close
and
reassuring
him
hurt
no
cold
now
all
right
now
we
sleep
now
part
when
spring
came
steve
schroeder
was
leader
as
lake
had
wanted
it
was
a
duty
and
a
responsibility
that
would
be
under
circumstances
different
from
those
of
any
of
the
leaders
before
him
the
grim
fight
was
over
for
a
while
they
were
adapted
and
increasing
in
number
going
into
big
summer
and
into
a
renascence
that
would
last
for
fifty
years
they
would
have
half
a
century
in
which
to
develop
their
environment
to
its
fullest
extent
then
big
fall
would
come
to
destroy
all
they
had
accomplished
and
the
gerns
would
come
to
destroy
them
it
was
his
job
to
make
certain
that
by
then
they
would
be
stronger
than
either
he
went
north
with
nine
men
as
soon
as
the
weather
permitted
it
was
hard
to
retrace
the
route
of
the
summer
before
without
compasses
among
the
hills
which
looked
all
the
same
as
far
as
their
binoculars
could
reach
and
it
was
summer
when
they
saw
the
hill
with
the
monument
they
found
lake
bones
a
few
miles
south
of
it
scattered
by
the
scavengers
as
were
the
little
bones
of
his
mocker
they
buried
them
together
man
and
mocker
and
went
silently
on
toward
the
hill
they
had
brought
a
little
diamond
drill
with
them
to
bore
holes
in
the
hard
granite
and
black
powder
for
blasting
they
mined
the
vein
sorting
out
the
ore
from
the
waste
and
saving
every
particle
the
vein
was
narrow
at
the
surface
and
pinched
very
rapidly
at
a
depth
of
six
feet
it
was
a
seam
at
ten
feet
it
was
only
a
red
discoloration
in
the
bottom
of
their
shaft
that
seems
to
be
all
of
it
he
said
to
the
others
we
send
men
up
here
next
year
to
go
deeper
and
farther
along
its
course
but
i
have
an
idea
we
just
mined
all
of
the
only
iron
vein
on
ragnarok
it
will
be
enough
for
our
purpose
they
sewed
the
ore
in
strong
rawhide
sacks
and
then
prospected
without
success
until
it
was
time
for
the
last
unicorn
band
to
pass
by
on
its
way
south
they
trapped
ten
unicorns
and
hobbled
their
legs
with
other
ropes
reaching
from
horn
to
hind
leg
on
each
side
to
prevent
them
from
swinging
back
their
heads
or
even
lifting
them
high
they
had
expected
the
capture
and
hobbling
of
the
unicorns
to
be
a
difficult
and
dangerous
job
and
it
was
but
when
they
were
finished
the
unicorns
were
helpless
they
could
move
awkwardly
about
to
graze
but
they
could
not
charge
they
could
only
stand
with
lowered
heads
and
fume
and
rumble
the
ore
sacks
were
tied
on
one
frosty
morning
and
the
men
mounted
the
ropes
were
loosened
so
the
unicorns
could
travel
and
the
unicorns
went
into
a
frenzy
of
bucking
and
rearing
squealing
with
rage
as
they
tried
to
impale
their
riders
the
short
spears
stabbing
at
the
sensitive
spot
behind
the
jawbones
of
the
unicorns
thwarted
the
backward
flung
heads
and
the
unicorns
were
slowly
forced
into
submission
the
last
one
conceded
temporary
defeat
and
the
long
journey
to
the
south
started
the
unicorns
going
in
the
run
that
they
could
maintain
hour
after
hour
each
day
they
pushed
the
unicorns
until
they
were
too
weary
to
fight
at
night
each
morning
rested
the
unicorns
resumed
the
battle
it
became
an
expected
routine
for
both
unicorns
and
men
the
unicorns
were
released
when
the
ore
was
unloaded
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
before
the
caves
and
schroeder
went
to
the
new
waterwheel
where
the
new
generator
was
already
in
place
there
george
craig
told
him
of
the
unexpected
obstacle
that
had
appeared
we
stuck
george
said
the
aluminum
ore
is
what
we
thought
it
would
be
it
scarce
and
very
low
grade
of
such
a
complex
nature
that
we
ca
refine
it
to
the
oxide
with
what
we
have
to
work
with
on
ragnarok
have
you
produced
any
aluminum
oxide
at
all
schroeder
asked
a
little
we
might
have
enough
for
the
wire
in
a
hundred
years
if
we
kept
at
it
hard
enough
what
else
do
you
need
was
there
enough
cryolite
he
asked
not
much
of
it
but
enough
we
have
the
generator
set
up
the
smelting
box
built
and
the
carbon
lining
and
rods
ready
we
have
everything
we
need
to
smelt
aluminum
ore
except
the
aluminum
go
ahead
and
finish
up
the
details
such
as
installing
the
lining
he
said
we
did
get
this
far
to
be
stopped
now
but
the
prospecting
parties
making
full
use
of
the
time
left
them
before
winter
closed
down
returned
late
that
fall
to
report
no
sign
of
the
ore
they
needed
spring
came
and
he
was
determined
they
would
be
smelting
aluminum
before
the
summer
was
over
even
though
he
had
no
idea
where
the
ore
would
be
found
they
needed
aluminum
ore
of
a
grade
high
enough
that
they
could
extract
the
pure
aluminum
oxide
specifically
they
needed
aluminum
oxide
then
he
saw
the
answer
to
their
problem
so
obvious
that
all
of
them
had
overlooked
it
he
passed
by
four
children
playing
a
game
in
front
of
the
caves
that
day
some
kind
of
a
game
in
which
differently
colored
rocks
represented
the
different
children
one
boy
was
using
red
stones
some
of
the
rubies
that
had
been
brought
back
as
curios
from
the
chasm
rubies
were
of
no
use
or
value
on
ragnarok
only
pretty
rocks
for
children
to
play
with
only
pretty
rocks
and
sapphires
were
corundum
were
pure
aluminum
oxide
he
went
to
tell
george
and
to
arrange
for
a
party
of
men
to
go
into
the
chasm
after
all
the
rubies
and
sapphires
they
could
find
the
last
obstacle
had
been
surmounted
the
summer
sun
was
hot
the
day
the
generator
hummed
into
life
the
smelting
box
was
ready
and
the
current
flowed
between
the
heavy
carbon
rods
suspended
in
the
cryolite
and
the
lining
transforming
the
cryolite
into
a
liquid
the
crushed
rubies
and
sapphires
were
fed
into
the
box
glowing
and
glittering
in
and
scintillations
of
light
to
be
deprived
by
the
current
of
their
life
and
fire
and
be
changed
into
something
entirely
different
when
the
time
came
to
draw
off
some
of
the
metal
they
opened
the
orifice
in
the
lower
corner
of
the
box
molten
aluminum
flowed
out
into
the
ingot
mold
in
a
little
stream
more
beautiful
to
them
than
any
gems
could
ever
be
bright
and
gleaming
in
its
promise
that
more
than
six
generations
of
imprisonment
would
soon
be
ended
the
aluminum
smelting
continued
until
the
supply
of
rubies
and
sapphires
in
the
chasm
had
been
exhausted
but
for
small
and
scattered
fragments
it
was
enough
with
some
aluminum
above
the
amount
needed
for
the
wire
it
was
the
year
one
hundred
and
when
they
smelted
the
aluminum
in
eight
more
years
they
would
reach
the
middle
of
big
summer
the
suns
would
start
their
long
drift
southward
not
to
return
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
time
was
passing
swiftly
by
for
them
and
there
was
none
of
it
to
waste
the
making
of
ceramics
was
developed
to
an
art
as
was
the
making
of
different
types
of
glass
looms
were
built
to
spin
thread
and
cloth
from
woods
goat
wool
and
vegetable
dyes
were
discovered
exploration
parties
crossed
the
continent
to
the
eastern
and
western
seas
salty
and
lifeless
seas
that
were
bordered
by
immense
deserts
no
trees
of
any
kind
grew
along
their
shores
and
ships
could
not
be
built
to
cross
them
efforts
were
continued
to
develop
an
inorganic
field
of
chemistry
with
discouraging
results
but
in
one
hundred
and
the
orange
corn
was
successfully
adapted
to
the
elevation
and
climate
of
the
caves
there
was
enough
that
year
to
feed
the
mockers
all
winter
supply
next
year
seeds
and
leave
enough
that
it
could
be
ground
and
baked
into
bread
for
all
to
taste
it
tasted
strange
but
good
it
was
schroeder
thought
symbolic
of
a
great
forward
step
it
was
the
first
time
in
generations
that
any
of
them
had
known
any
food
but
meat
the
corn
would
make
them
less
dependent
upon
hunting
and
of
paramount
importance
it
was
the
type
of
food
to
which
they
would
have
to
become
accustomed
in
the
future
they
could
not
carry
herds
of
woods
goats
and
unicorns
with
them
on
gern
battle
cruisers
the
lack
of
metals
hindered
them
wherever
they
turned
in
their
efforts
to
build
even
the
simplest
machines
or
weapons
despite
its
dubious
prospects
however
they
made
a
gun
the
barrel
of
it
was
thick
of
the
hardest
toughest
ceramic
material
they
could
produce
it
was
a
cumbersome
heavy
thing
firing
with
a
flintlock
action
and
it
could
not
be
loaded
with
much
powder
lest
the
charge
burst
the
barrel
the
flintlock
ignition
was
not
instantaneous
the
lightweight
porcelain
bullet
had
far
less
penetrating
power
than
an
arrow
and
the
thing
boomed
and
belched
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
that
would
have
shown
the
gerns
exactly
where
the
shooter
was
located
it
was
an
interesting
curio
and
the
firing
of
it
was
something
spectacular
to
behold
but
it
was
a
weapon
apt
to
be
much
more
dangerous
to
the
man
behind
it
than
to
the
gern
it
was
aimed
at
automatic
crossbows
were
far
better
woods
goats
had
been
trapped
and
housed
during
the
summers
in
shelters
where
sprays
of
water
maintained
a
temperature
cool
enough
for
them
to
survive
only
the
young
were
kept
when
fall
came
to
be
sheltered
through
the
winter
in
one
of
the
caves
each
new
generation
was
subjected
to
more
heat
in
the
summer
and
more
cold
in
the
winter
than
the
generation
before
it
and
by
the
year
one
hundred
and
sixty
the
woods
goats
were
well
on
their
way
toward
adaptation
the
next
year
they
trapped
two
unicorns
to
begin
the
job
of
adapting
and
taming
future
generations
of
them
if
they
succeeded
they
would
have
utilized
the
resources
of
ragnarok
to
the
limit
except
for
what
should
be
their
most
valuable
ally
with
which
to
fight
the
gerns
the
prowlers
for
twenty
years
prowlers
had
observed
a
truce
wherein
they
would
not
go
hunting
for
men
if
men
would
stay
away
from
their
routes
of
travel
but
it
was
a
truce
only
and
there
was
no
indication
that
it
could
ever
evolve
into
friendship
three
times
in
the
past
prowlers
had
been
captured
and
caged
in
the
hope
of
taming
them
each
time
they
had
paced
their
cages
looking
longingly
into
the
distance
refusing
to
eat
and
defiant
until
they
died
to
prowlers
as
to
some
men
freedom
was
more
precious
than
life
and
each
time
a
prowler
had
been
captured
the
free
ones
had
retaliated
with
a
resurgence
of
savage
attacks
there
seemed
no
way
that
men
and
prowlers
could
ever
meet
on
common
ground
they
were
alien
to
one
another
separated
by
the
gulf
of
an
origin
on
worlds
two
hundred
and
fifty
apart
their
only
common
heritage
was
the
will
of
each
to
battle
but
in
the
spring
of
one
hundred
and
for
a
little
while
one
day
the
gulf
was
bridged
schroeder
was
returning
from
a
trip
he
had
taken
alone
to
the
east
coming
down
the
long
canyon
that
led
from
the
high
face
of
the
plateau
to
the
country
near
the
caves
he
hurried
glancing
back
at
the
black
clouds
that
had
gathered
so
quickly
on
the
mountain
behind
him
thunder
rumbled
from
within
them
an
almost
continuous
roll
of
it
as
the
clouds
poured
down
their
deluge
of
water
a
cloudburst
was
coming
and
the
canyon
down
which
he
hurried
had
suddenly
become
a
death
trap
its
sunlit
quiet
soon
to
be
transformed
into
roaring
destruction
there
was
only
one
place
along
its
length
where
he
might
climb
out
and
the
time
was
already
short
in
which
to
reach
it
he
had
increased
his
pace
to
a
trot
when
he
came
to
it
a
talus
of
broken
rock
that
sloped
up
steeply
for
thirty
feet
to
a
shelf
a
ledge
eleven
feet
high
stood
over
the
shelf
and
other
lower
ledges
set
back
from
it
like
climbing
steps
at
the
foot
of
the
talus
he
stopped
to
listen
wondering
how
close
behind
him
the
water
might
be
he
heard
it
coming
a
sound
like
the
roaring
of
a
high
wind
up
the
canyon
and
he
scrambled
up
the
talus
of
loose
rock
to
the
shelf
at
its
top
the
shelf
was
not
high
enough
above
the
canyon
floor
he
would
be
killed
there
and
he
followed
it
fifty
feet
around
a
sharp
bend
there
it
narrowed
abruptly
to
merge
into
the
sheer
wall
of
the
canyon
blind
alley
he
ran
back
to
the
top
of
the
talus
where
the
edge
of
the
ledge
ragged
with
projections
of
rock
was
unreachably
far
above
him
as
he
did
so
the
roaring
was
suddenly
a
crashing
booming
thunder
and
he
saw
the
water
coming
it
swept
around
the
bend
at
perhaps
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
stretching
from
wall
to
wall
of
the
canyon
the
crest
of
it
seething
and
slashing
and
towering
forty
sheer
feet
above
the
canyon
floor
a
prowler
was
running
in
front
of
it
running
for
its
life
and
losing
there
was
no
time
to
watch
he
leaped
upward
as
high
as
possible
his
crossbow
in
his
hand
he
caught
the
end
of
the
bow
over
one
of
the
sharp
projections
of
rock
on
the
ledge
rim
and
began
to
pull
himself
up
afraid
to
hurry
lest
the
rock
cut
the
bowstring
in
two
and
drop
him
back
it
held
and
he
stood
on
the
ledge
safe
as
the
prowler
flashed
up
the
talus
below
it
darted
around
the
shelf
and
was
back
a
moment
later
it
saw
that
its
only
chance
would
be
to
leap
up
on
the
ledge
where
he
stood
and
it
tried
handicapped
by
the
steep
loose
slope
it
had
to
jump
from
it
failed
and
fell
back
it
tried
again
hurling
itself
upward
with
all
its
strength
and
its
claws
caught
fleetingly
on
the
rough
rock
a
foot
below
the
rim
it
began
to
slide
back
with
no
time
left
it
for
a
third
try
it
looked
up
at
the
rim
of
safety
that
it
had
not
quite
reached
and
then
on
up
at
him
its
eyes
bright
and
cold
with
the
knowledge
that
it
was
going
to
die
and
its
enemy
would
watch
it
schroeder
dropped
flat
on
his
stomach
and
reached
down
past
the
massive
black
head
to
seize
the
prowler
by
the
back
of
the
neck
he
pulled
up
with
all
his
strength
and
the
claws
of
the
prowler
tore
at
the
rocks
as
it
climbed
when
it
was
coming
up
over
the
ledge
safe
he
rolled
back
from
it
and
came
to
his
feet
in
one
swift
wary
motion
his
eyes
on
it
and
his
knife
already
in
his
hand
as
he
did
so
the
water
went
past
below
them
with
a
thunder
that
deafened
logs
and
trees
shot
past
boulders
crashed
together
and
things
could
be
seen
surging
in
the
brown
depths
shapeless
things
that
had
once
been
woods
goats
and
the
battered
gray
bulk
of
a
unicorn
he
saw
it
all
with
a
sideward
glance
his
attention
on
the
prowler
it
stepped
back
from
the
rim
of
the
ledge
and
looked
at
him
warily
as
he
looked
at
it
with
the
wariness
was
something
like
question
and
almost
disbelief
the
ledge
they
stood
on
was
narrow
but
it
led
out
of
the
canyon
and
to
the
open
land
beyond
he
motioned
to
the
prowler
to
precede
him
and
hesitating
a
moment
it
did
so
they
climbed
out
of
the
canyon
and
out
onto
the
grassy
slope
of
the
mountainside
the
roar
of
the
water
was
a
distant
rumble
there
and
he
stopped
the
prowler
did
the
same
and
they
watched
each
other
again
each
of
them
trying
to
understand
what
the
thoughts
of
the
other
might
be
it
was
something
they
could
not
know
they
were
too
alien
to
each
other
and
had
been
enemies
too
long
then
a
gust
of
wind
swept
across
them
bending
and
rippling
the
tall
grass
and
the
prowler
swung
away
to
go
with
it
and
leave
him
standing
alone
his
route
was
such
that
it
diverged
gradually
from
that
taken
by
the
prowler
he
went
through
a
grove
of
trees
and
emerged
into
an
open
glade
on
the
other
side
up
on
the
ridge
to
his
right
he
saw
something
black
for
a
moment
already
far
away
he
was
thirty
feet
from
the
next
grove
of
trees
when
he
saw
the
gray
shadow
waiting
silently
for
his
coming
within
them
unicorn
his
crossbow
rattled
as
he
jerked
back
the
pistol
grip
the
unicorn
charged
the
underbrush
crackling
as
it
tore
through
it
and
a
vine
whipping
like
a
rope
from
its
lowered
horn
his
first
arrow
went
into
its
chest
it
lurched
fatally
wounded
but
still
coming
and
he
jerked
back
on
the
pistol
grip
for
the
quick
shot
that
would
stop
it
the
bow
string
broke
with
a
singing
sound
and
the
bow
ends
snapped
harmlessly
forward
he
had
counted
on
the
bow
and
its
failure
came
a
fraction
of
a
second
too
late
for
him
to
dodge
far
enough
his
sideward
leap
was
short
and
the
horn
caught
him
in
midair
ripping
across
his
ribs
and
breaking
them
shattering
the
bone
of
his
left
arm
and
tearing
the
flesh
he
was
hurled
fifteen
feet
and
he
struck
the
ground
with
a
stunning
impact
pain
washing
over
him
in
a
blinding
wave
through
it
dimly
he
saw
the
unicorn
fall
and
heard
its
dying
trumpet
blast
as
it
called
to
another
he
heard
an
answering
call
somewhere
in
the
distance
and
then
the
faraway
drumming
of
hooves
he
fought
back
the
blindness
and
used
his
good
arm
to
lift
himself
up
his
bow
was
useless
his
spear
lay
broken
under
the
unicorn
and
his
knife
was
gone
his
left
arm
swung
helplessly
and
he
could
not
climb
the
limbless
lower
trunk
of
a
lance
tree
with
only
one
arm
he
went
forward
limping
trying
to
hurry
to
find
his
knife
while
the
drumming
of
hooves
raced
toward
him
it
would
be
a
battle
already
lost
that
he
would
make
with
the
short
knife
but
he
would
have
blood
for
his
going
the
grass
grew
tall
and
thick
hiding
the
knife
until
he
could
hear
the
unicorn
crashing
through
the
trees
he
saw
it
ten
feet
ahead
of
him
as
the
unicorn
tore
out
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
thirty
feet
away
it
squealed
shrill
with
triumph
and
the
horn
swept
up
to
impale
him
there
was
no
time
left
to
reach
the
knife
no
time
left
for
anything
but
the
last
fleeting
sight
of
sunshine
and
glade
and
arching
blue
sky
something
from
behind
him
shot
past
and
up
at
the
unicorn
throat
a
thing
that
was
snarling
black
savagery
with
yellow
eyes
blazing
and
white
fangs
slashing
the
prowler
it
ripped
at
the
unicorn
throat
swerving
its
charge
and
the
unicorn
plunged
past
him
the
unicorn
swung
back
all
the
triumph
gone
from
its
squeal
and
the
prowler
struck
again
they
became
a
swirling
blur
the
horn
of
the
unicorn
swinging
and
stabbing
and
the
attacks
of
the
prowler
like
the
swift
relentless
thrusting
of
a
rapier
he
went
to
his
knife
and
when
he
turned
back
with
it
in
his
hand
the
battle
was
already
over
the
unicorn
fell
and
the
prowler
turned
away
from
it
one
foreleg
was
bathed
in
blood
and
its
chest
was
heaving
with
a
panting
so
fast
that
it
could
not
have
been
caused
by
the
fight
with
the
unicorn
must
have
been
watching
he
thought
with
a
strange
feeling
of
wonder
was
watching
from
the
ridge
and
it
ran
all
the
its
yellow
eyes
flickered
to
the
knife
in
his
hand
he
dropped
the
knife
in
the
grass
and
walked
forward
unarmed
wanting
the
prowler
to
know
that
he
understood
that
for
them
in
that
moment
the
gulf
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
did
not
exist
he
stopped
near
it
and
squatted
in
the
grass
to
begin
binding
up
his
broken
arm
so
the
bones
would
not
grate
together
it
watched
him
then
it
began
to
lick
at
its
bloody
shoulder
standing
so
close
to
him
that
he
could
have
reached
out
and
touched
it
again
he
felt
the
sense
of
wonder
they
were
alone
together
in
the
glade
he
and
a
prowler
each
caring
for
his
hurts
there
was
a
bond
between
them
that
for
a
little
while
made
them
like
brothers
there
was
a
bridge
for
a
little
while
across
the
gulf
that
had
never
been
bridged
before
when
he
had
finished
with
his
arm
and
the
prowler
had
lessened
the
bleeding
of
its
shoulder
it
took
a
step
back
toward
the
ridge
he
stood
up
knowing
it
was
going
to
leave
i
suppose
the
score
is
even
now
he
said
to
it
and
we
never
see
each
other
again
so
good
hunting
and
thanks
it
made
a
sound
in
its
throat
a
queer
sound
that
was
neither
bark
nor
growl
and
he
had
the
feeling
it
was
trying
to
tell
him
something
then
it
turned
and
was
gone
like
a
black
shadow
across
the
grass
and
he
was
alone
again
he
picked
up
his
knife
and
bow
and
began
the
long
painful
journey
back
to
the
caves
looking
again
and
again
at
the
ridge
behind
him
and
thinking
have
a
code
of
ethics
they
fight
for
their
survival
but
they
pay
their
ragnarok
was
big
enough
for
both
men
and
prowlers
they
could
live
together
in
friendship
as
men
and
dogs
of
earth
lived
together
it
might
take
a
long
time
to
win
the
trust
of
the
prowlers
but
surely
it
could
be
done
he
came
to
the
rocky
trail
that
led
to
the
caves
and
there
he
took
a
last
look
at
the
ridge
behind
him
feeling
a
poignant
sense
of
loss
and
wondering
if
he
would
ever
see
the
prowler
again
or
ever
again
know
the
strange
wild
companionship
he
had
known
that
day
perhaps
he
never
would
but
the
time
would
come
on
ragnarok
when
children
would
play
in
the
grass
with
prowler
pups
and
the
time
would
come
when
men
and
prowlers
side
by
side
would
face
the
gerns
in
the
year
that
followed
there
were
two
incidents
when
a
prowler
had
the
opportunity
to
kill
a
hunter
on
prowler
territory
and
did
not
do
so
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
if
the
prowler
in
each
case
had
been
the
one
he
had
saved
from
the
cloudburst
or
if
the
prowlers
as
a
whole
were
respecting
what
a
human
had
done
for
one
of
them
schroeder
thought
of
again
trying
to
capture
prowler
pups
very
young
ones
and
decided
it
would
be
a
stupid
plan
such
an
act
would
destroy
all
that
had
been
done
toward
winning
the
trust
of
the
prowlers
it
would
be
better
to
wait
even
though
time
was
growing
short
and
find
some
other
way
the
fall
of
one
hundred
and
came
and
the
suns
were
noticeably
moving
south
that
was
the
fall
that
his
third
child
a
girl
was
born
she
was
named
julia
after
the
julia
of
long
ago
and
she
was
of
the
last
generation
that
would
be
born
in
the
caves
plans
were
already
under
way
to
build
a
town
in
the
valley
a
mile
from
the
caves
the
stockade
wall
that
would
enclose
it
was
already
under
construction
being
made
of
stone
blocks
the
houses
would
be
of
stone
with
spaces
between
the
double
walls
to
insulate
against
heat
and
cold
tall
wide
canopies
of
lance
tree
poles
and
the
medusabush
leaves
would
be
built
over
all
the
houses
to
supply
additional
shade
the
woods
goats
were
fully
adapted
that
year
and
domesticated
to
such
an
extent
that
they
had
no
desire
to
migrate
with
the
wild
goats
there
was
a
small
herd
of
them
then
enough
to
supply
a
limited
amount
of
milk
cheese
and
wool
the
adaptation
of
the
unicorns
proceeded
in
the
following
years
but
not
their
domestication
it
was
their
nature
to
be
and
treacherous
and
only
the
threat
of
the
spears
in
the
hands
of
their
drivers
forced
them
to
work
work
that
they
could
have
done
easily
had
they
not
diverted
so
much
effort
each
day
to
trying
to
turn
on
their
masters
and
kill
them
each
night
they
were
put
in
a
corral
for
they
were
almost
as
dangerous
as
wild
unicorns
the
slow
painstaking
work
on
the
transmitter
continued
while
the
suns
moved
farther
south
each
year
the
move
from
the
caves
to
the
new
town
was
made
in
one
hundred
and
the
year
that
schroeder
wife
died
his
two
sons
were
grown
and
married
and
julia
at
sixteen
was
a
woman
by
ragnarok
standards
and
as
her
mother
a
craig
had
been
and
strikingly
pretty
in
a
wild
reckless
way
she
married
will
humbolt
that
spring
leaving
her
father
alone
in
the
new
house
in
the
new
town
four
months
later
she
came
to
him
to
announce
with
pride
and
excitement
i
going
to
have
a
baby
in
only
six
months
if
it
a
boy
he
be
the
right
age
to
be
leader
when
the
gerns
come
and
we
going
to
name
him
john
after
the
john
who
was
the
first
leader
we
ever
had
on
ragnarok
her
words
brought
to
his
mind
a
question
and
he
thought
of
what
old
dale
craig
the
leader
who
had
preceded
lake
had
written
have
survived
the
generations
that
the
gerns
thought
would
never
be
born
but
we
must
never
forget
the
characteristics
that
insured
that
survival
an
unswerving
loyalty
of
every
individual
to
all
the
others
and
the
courage
to
fight
and
die
if
necessary
in
any
year
now
the
gerns
will
come
there
will
be
no
one
to
help
us
those
on
athena
are
slaves
and
it
is
probable
that
earth
has
been
enslaved
by
now
we
will
stand
or
fall
alone
but
if
we
of
today
could
know
that
the
ones
who
meet
the
gerns
will
still
have
the
courage
and
loyalty
that
made
our
survival
possible
then
we
would
know
that
the
gerns
are
already
defeated
the
era
of
danger
and
violence
was
over
for
a
little
while
the
younger
generation
had
grown
up
during
a
time
of
peaceful
development
of
their
environment
it
was
a
peace
that
the
coming
of
the
gerns
would
shatter
but
had
it
softened
the
courage
and
loyalty
of
the
younger
generation
a
week
later
he
was
given
his
answer
he
was
climbing
up
the
hill
that
morning
high
above
the
town
below
when
he
saw
the
blue
of
julia
wool
blouse
in
the
distance
she
was
sitting
up
on
a
hillside
an
open
book
in
her
lap
and
her
short
spear
lying
beside
her
he
frowned
at
the
sight
the
main
southward
migration
of
unicorns
was
over
but
there
were
often
lone
stragglers
who
might
appear
at
any
time
he
had
warned
her
that
someday
a
unicorn
would
kill
her
but
she
was
reckless
by
nature
and
given
to
restless
moods
in
which
she
could
not
stand
the
confinement
of
the
town
she
jerked
up
her
head
as
he
watched
as
though
at
a
faint
sound
and
he
saw
the
first
movement
within
the
trees
behind
her
a
unicorn
it
lunged
forward
its
stealth
abandoned
as
she
heard
it
and
she
came
to
her
feet
in
a
swift
smooth
movement
the
spear
in
her
hand
and
the
book
spilling
to
the
ground
the
unicorn
squeal
rang
out
and
she
whirled
to
face
it
with
two
seconds
to
live
he
reached
for
his
bow
knowing
his
help
would
come
too
late
she
did
the
only
thing
possible
that
might
enable
her
to
survive
she
shifted
her
balance
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
a
human
could
jump
to
one
side
a
little
more
quickly
than
a
beast
in
headlong
charge
as
she
did
so
she
brought
up
the
spear
for
the
thrust
into
the
vulnerable
area
just
behind
the
jawbone
it
seemed
the
needle
point
of
the
black
horn
was
no
more
than
an
length
from
her
stomach
when
she
jumped
aside
with
the
lithe
quickness
of
a
prowler
swinging
as
she
jumped
and
thrusting
the
spear
with
all
her
strength
into
the
unicorn
neck
the
thrust
was
true
and
the
spear
went
deep
she
released
it
and
flung
herself
backward
to
dodge
the
flying
hooves
the
force
of
the
charge
took
it
past
her
but
its
legs
collapsed
under
it
and
it
crashed
to
the
ground
sliding
a
little
way
before
it
stopped
it
kicked
once
and
lay
still
she
went
to
it
to
retrieve
her
spear
and
even
from
the
distance
there
was
an
air
of
pride
about
her
as
she
walked
past
her
bulky
victim
then
she
saw
the
book
knocked
to
one
side
by
the
unicorn
hooves
tatters
of
its
pages
were
blowing
in
the
wind
and
she
stiffened
her
face
growing
pale
she
ran
to
it
to
pick
it
up
the
unicorn
forgotten
she
was
trying
to
smooth
the
torn
leaves
when
he
reached
her
it
had
been
one
of
the
old
textbooks
printed
on
real
paper
and
it
was
fragile
with
age
she
had
been
trusted
by
the
librarian
to
take
good
care
of
it
now
page
after
page
was
torn
and
unreadable
she
looked
up
at
him
shame
and
misery
on
her
face
father
she
said
the
book
i
he
saw
that
the
unicorn
was
a
bull
considerably
larger
than
the
average
men
had
in
the
past
killed
unicorns
with
spears
but
never
before
had
a
girl
done
so
he
looked
back
at
her
keeping
his
face
emotionless
and
asked
sternly
you
what
i
guess
i
guess
i
did
have
any
right
to
take
the
book
out
of
town
i
wish
i
had
you
promised
to
take
good
care
of
it
he
told
her
coldly
your
promise
was
believed
and
you
were
trusted
to
keep
it
but
but
i
did
mean
to
damage
it
i
did
mean
to
she
was
suddenly
very
near
to
tears
i
not
a
a
go
back
to
town
he
ordered
tonight
bring
the
book
to
the
town
hall
and
tell
the
council
what
happened
to
it
she
swallowed
and
said
in
a
faint
voice
yes
father
she
turned
and
started
slowly
back
down
the
hill
not
seeing
the
unicorn
as
she
passed
it
the
bloody
spear
trailing
disconsolately
behind
her
and
her
head
hanging
in
shame
he
watched
her
go
and
it
was
safe
for
him
to
smile
when
night
came
and
she
stood
before
the
council
ashamed
to
lift
her
eyes
to
look
at
them
he
would
have
to
be
grim
and
stern
as
he
told
her
how
she
had
been
trusted
and
how
she
had
betrayed
that
trust
but
now
as
he
watched
her
go
down
the
hill
he
could
smile
with
his
pride
in
her
and
know
that
his
question
was
answered
that
the
younger
generation
had
lost
neither
courage
nor
loyalty
julia
saved
a
child
life
that
spring
and
almost
lost
her
own
the
child
was
playing
under
a
canopy
when
a
sudden
violent
wind
struck
it
and
transformed
it
into
a
of
cracking
falling
timbers
she
reached
him
in
time
to
fling
him
to
safety
but
the
collapsing
roof
caught
her
before
she
could
make
her
own
escape
her
chest
and
throat
were
torn
by
the
jagged
ends
of
the
broken
poles
and
for
a
day
and
a
night
her
life
was
a
feebly
flickering
spark
she
began
to
rally
on
the
second
night
and
on
the
third
morning
she
was
able
to
speak
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
dark
and
tortured
with
her
fear
my
baby
what
did
it
do
to
him
she
convalesced
slowly
haunted
by
the
fear
her
son
was
born
five
weeks
later
and
her
fears
proved
to
have
been
groundless
he
was
perfectly
normal
and
healthy
and
hungry
and
her
slowly
healing
breasts
would
be
dry
for
weeks
to
come
by
a
coincidence
that
had
never
happened
before
and
could
never
happen
again
there
was
not
a
single
available
for
the
baby
there
were
many
expectant
mothers
but
only
three
women
had
young
babies
and
each
of
the
three
had
twins
to
feed
but
there
was
a
small
supply
of
frozen
goat
milk
in
the
ice
house
enough
to
see
young
johnny
through
until
it
was
time
for
the
goat
herd
to
give
milk
he
would
have
to
live
on
short
rations
until
then
but
it
could
not
be
helped
johnny
was
a
month
old
when
the
opportunity
came
for
the
men
of
ragnarok
to
have
their
ultimate
ally
the
last
of
the
unicorns
were
going
north
and
the
prowlers
had
long
since
gone
the
blue
star
was
lighting
the
night
like
a
small
sun
when
the
breeze
coming
through
schroeder
window
brought
the
distant
squealing
of
unicorns
he
listened
wondering
it
was
a
sound
that
did
not
belong
everyone
was
safely
in
the
town
most
of
them
in
bed
and
there
should
be
nothing
outside
the
stockade
for
the
unicorns
to
fight
he
armed
himself
with
spear
and
crossbow
and
went
outside
he
let
himself
out
through
the
east
gate
and
went
toward
the
sounds
of
battle
they
grew
louder
as
he
approached
more
furious
as
though
the
battle
was
reaching
its
climax
he
crossed
the
creek
and
went
through
the
trees
beyond
there
in
a
small
clearing
no
more
than
half
a
mile
from
the
town
he
came
upon
the
scene
a
lone
prowler
was
making
a
stand
against
two
unicorns
two
other
unicorns
lay
on
the
ground
dead
and
behind
the
prowler
was
the
dark
shape
of
its
mate
lying
lifelessly
in
the
grass
there
was
blood
on
the
prowler
purple
in
the
blue
starlight
and
gloating
rang
in
the
squeals
of
the
unicorns
as
they
lunged
at
it
the
leaps
of
the
prowler
were
faltering
as
it
fought
them
the
last
desperate
defiance
of
an
animal
already
dying
he
brought
up
the
bow
and
sent
a
volley
of
arrows
into
the
unicorns
their
gloating
squeals
died
and
they
fell
the
prowler
staggered
and
fell
beside
them
it
was
breathing
its
last
when
he
reached
it
but
in
the
way
it
looked
up
at
him
he
had
the
feeling
that
it
wanted
to
tell
him
something
that
it
was
trying
hard
to
live
long
enough
to
do
so
it
died
with
the
strange
appeal
in
its
eyes
and
not
until
then
did
he
see
the
scar
on
its
shoulder
a
scar
such
as
might
have
been
made
long
ago
by
the
rip
of
a
unicorn
horn
it
was
the
prowler
he
had
known
nineteen
years
before
the
ground
was
trampled
all
around
by
the
unicorns
showing
that
the
prowlers
had
been
besieged
all
day
he
went
to
the
other
prowler
and
saw
it
was
a
female
her
breasts
showed
that
she
had
had
pups
recently
but
she
had
been
dead
at
least
two
days
her
hind
legs
had
been
broken
sometime
that
spring
and
they
were
still
only
half
healed
twisted
and
almost
useless
then
that
was
why
the
two
of
them
were
so
far
behind
the
other
prowlers
prowlers
like
the
wolves
coyotes
and
foxes
of
earth
mated
for
life
and
the
male
helped
take
care
of
the
young
she
had
been
injured
somewhere
to
the
south
perhaps
in
a
fight
with
unicorns
and
her
mate
had
stayed
with
her
as
she
hobbled
her
slow
way
along
and
killed
game
for
her
the
pups
had
been
born
and
they
had
had
to
stop
then
the
unicorns
had
found
them
and
the
female
had
been
too
crippled
to
fight
he
looked
for
the
pups
expecting
to
find
them
trampled
and
dead
but
they
were
alive
hidden
under
the
roots
of
a
small
tree
near
their
mother
prowler
pups
they
were
very
young
small
and
blind
and
helpless
he
picked
them
up
and
his
elation
drained
away
as
he
looked
at
them
they
made
little
sounds
of
hunger
almost
inaudible
and
they
moved
feebly
trying
to
find
their
mother
breasts
and
already
so
weak
that
they
could
not
lift
their
heads
small
chunks
of
fresh
meat
had
been
left
beside
the
pups
and
he
thought
of
what
the
prowler
emotions
must
have
been
as
his
mate
lay
dead
on
the
ground
and
he
carried
meat
to
their
young
knowing
they
were
too
small
to
eat
it
but
helpless
to
do
anything
else
for
them
and
he
knew
why
there
had
been
the
appeal
in
the
eyes
of
the
prowler
as
it
died
and
what
it
had
tried
to
tell
him
them
as
you
once
saved
he
carried
the
pups
back
past
the
prowler
and
looked
down
at
it
in
passing
i
do
my
best
he
said
when
he
reached
his
house
he
laid
the
pups
on
his
bed
and
built
a
fire
there
was
no
milk
to
give
them
the
goats
would
not
have
young
for
at
least
another
two
weeks
but
perhaps
they
could
eat
a
soup
of
some
kind
he
put
water
on
to
boil
and
began
shredding
meat
to
make
them
a
rich
broth
one
of
them
was
a
male
the
other
a
female
and
if
he
could
save
them
they
would
fight
beside
the
men
of
ragnarok
when
the
gerns
came
he
thought
of
what
he
would
name
them
as
he
worked
he
would
name
the
female
sigyn
after
loki
faithful
wife
who
went
with
him
when
the
gods
condemned
him
to
hel
the
teutonic
underworld
and
he
would
name
the
male
fenrir
after
the
monster
wolf
who
would
fight
beside
loki
when
loki
led
the
forces
of
hel
in
the
final
battle
on
the
day
of
ragnarok
but
when
the
broth
was
prepared
and
cooled
enough
the
pups
could
not
eat
it
he
tried
making
it
weaker
tried
it
mixed
with
corn
and
herb
soup
tried
corn
and
herb
soups
alone
they
could
eat
nothing
he
prepared
for
them
when
gray
daylight
entered
the
room
he
had
tried
everything
possible
and
had
failed
he
sat
wearily
in
his
chair
and
watched
them
defeated
they
were
no
longer
crying
in
their
hunger
and
when
he
touched
them
they
did
not
move
as
they
had
done
before
they
would
be
dead
before
the
day
was
over
and
the
only
chance
men
had
ever
had
to
have
prowlers
as
their
friends
and
allies
would
be
gone
the
first
rays
of
sunrise
were
coming
into
the
room
revealing
fully
the
frail
thinness
of
the
pups
when
there
was
a
step
outside
and
julia
voice
father
come
in
julia
he
said
not
moving
she
entered
still
a
pale
shadow
of
the
reckless
girl
who
had
fought
a
unicorn
even
though
she
was
slowly
regaining
her
normal
health
she
carried
young
johnny
in
one
arm
in
her
other
hand
his
little
bottle
of
milk
johnny
was
hungry
there
was
never
quite
enough
milk
for
him
but
he
was
not
crying
ragnarok
children
did
not
cry
she
saw
the
pups
and
her
eyes
went
wide
prowlers
baby
prowlers
where
did
you
get
them
he
told
her
and
she
went
to
them
to
look
down
at
them
and
say
if
you
and
their
father
had
helped
each
other
that
day
they
would
be
here
nor
you
nor
i
nor
johnny
none
of
us
in
this
room
they
wo
live
out
the
day
he
said
they
have
to
have
milk
and
there
is
any
she
reached
down
to
touch
them
and
they
seemed
to
sense
that
she
was
someone
different
they
stirred
making
tiny
whimpering
sounds
and
trying
to
move
their
heads
to
nuzzle
at
her
fingers
compassion
came
to
her
face
like
a
soft
light
they
so
young
she
said
so
terribly
young
to
have
to
die
she
looked
at
johnny
and
at
the
little
bottle
that
held
his
morning
ration
of
milk
johnny
johnny
her
words
were
almost
a
whisper
hungry
but
we
ca
let
them
die
and
someday
for
this
they
will
fight
for
your
life
she
sat
on
the
bed
and
placed
the
pups
in
her
lap
beside
johnny
she
lifted
a
little
black
head
with
gentle
fingers
and
a
little
pink
mouth
ceased
whimpering
as
it
found
the
nipple
of
johnny
bottle
johnny
gray
eyes
darkened
with
the
storm
of
approaching
protest
then
the
other
pup
touched
his
hand
crying
in
its
hunger
and
the
protest
faded
as
surprise
and
something
like
sudden
understanding
came
into
his
eyes
julia
withdrew
the
bottle
from
the
first
pup
and
transferred
it
to
the
second
one
its
crying
ceased
and
johnny
leaned
forward
to
touch
it
again
and
the
one
beside
it
he
made
his
decision
with
an
approving
sound
and
leaned
back
against
his
mother
shoulder
patiently
awaiting
his
own
turn
and
their
presence
accepted
as
though
they
had
been
born
his
brother
and
sister
the
golden
light
of
the
new
day
shone
on
them
on
his
daughter
and
grandson
and
the
prowler
pups
and
in
it
he
saw
the
bright
omen
for
the
future
his
own
role
was
nearing
its
end
but
he
had
seen
the
people
of
ragnarok
conquer
their
environment
in
so
far
as
big
winter
would
ever
let
it
be
conquered
the
last
generation
was
being
born
the
generation
that
would
meet
the
gerns
and
now
they
would
have
their
final
ally
perhaps
it
would
be
johnny
who
led
them
on
that
day
as
the
omen
seemed
to
prophesy
he
was
the
son
of
a
line
of
leaders
born
to
a
mother
who
had
fought
and
killed
a
unicorn
he
had
gone
hungry
to
share
what
little
he
had
with
the
young
of
ragnarok
most
proud
and
savage
species
and
fenrir
and
sigyn
would
fight
beside
him
on
the
day
he
led
the
forces
of
the
in
the
battle
with
the
gerns
who
thought
they
were
gods
could
the
gerns
hope
to
have
a
leader
to
match
part
john
humbolt
leader
stood
on
the
wide
stockade
wall
and
watched
the
lowering
sun
touch
the
western
horizon
far
south
of
where
it
had
set
when
he
was
a
child
big
summer
was
over
and
now
in
the
year
two
hundred
they
were
already
three
years
into
big
fall
the
craigs
had
been
impassable
with
snow
for
five
years
and
the
country
at
the
north
end
of
the
plateau
where
the
iron
had
been
found
had
been
buried
under
snow
and
growing
glaciers
for
twenty
years
there
came
the
soft
tinkling
of
ceramic
bells
as
the
herd
of
milk
goats
came
down
off
the
hills
two
children
were
following
and
six
prowlers
walked
with
them
to
protect
them
from
wild
unicorns
there
were
not
many
of
the
goats
each
year
the
winters
were
longer
requiring
the
stocking
of
a
larger
supply
of
hay
the
time
would
come
when
the
summers
would
be
so
short
and
the
winters
so
long
that
they
could
not
keep
goats
at
all
and
by
then
when
big
winter
had
closed
in
on
them
the
summer
seasons
would
be
too
short
for
the
growing
of
the
orange
corn
they
would
have
nothing
left
but
the
hunting
they
had
he
knew
reached
and
passed
the
zenith
of
the
development
of
their
environment
from
a
low
of
men
women
and
children
in
dark
caves
they
had
risen
to
a
town
of
six
thousand
for
a
few
years
they
had
had
a
way
of
life
that
was
almost
a
civilization
but
the
inevitable
decline
was
already
under
way
the
years
of
frozen
sterility
of
big
winter
were
coming
and
no
amount
of
determination
or
ingenuity
could
alter
them
six
thousand
would
have
to
live
by
hunting
and
one
hundred
in
the
first
big
winter
had
found
barely
enough
game
they
would
have
to
migrate
in
one
of
two
different
ways
they
could
go
to
the
south
as
nomad
hunters
or
they
could
go
to
other
fairer
worlds
in
ships
they
took
from
the
gerns
the
choice
was
very
easy
to
make
and
they
were
almost
ready
in
the
workshop
at
the
farther
edge
of
town
the
hyperspace
transmitter
was
nearing
completion
the
little
smelter
was
waiting
to
receive
the
lathe
and
other
iron
and
steel
and
turn
them
into
the
castings
for
the
generator
their
weapons
were
ready
the
mockers
were
trained
the
prowlers
were
waiting
and
in
the
massive
corral
beyond
town
forty
unicorns
trampled
the
ground
and
hated
the
world
wanting
to
kill
something
they
had
learned
to
be
afraid
of
ragnarok
men
but
they
would
not
be
afraid
to
kill
gerns
the
children
with
the
goats
reached
the
stockade
and
two
of
the
prowlers
fenrir
and
sigyn
turned
to
see
him
standing
on
the
wall
he
made
a
little
motion
with
his
hand
and
they
came
running
to
leap
up
beside
him
on
the
wall
so
you
been
checking
up
on
how
well
the
young
ones
guard
the
children
he
asked
sigyn
lolled
out
her
tongue
and
her
white
teeth
grinned
at
him
in
answer
fenrir
always
the
grimmer
of
the
two
made
a
sound
in
his
throat
in
reply
prowlers
developed
something
like
a
telepathic
rapport
with
their
masters
and
could
sense
their
thoughts
and
understand
relatively
complex
instructions
their
intelligence
was
greater
and
of
a
far
more
mature
order
than
that
of
the
little
mockers
but
their
vocal
cords
were
not
capable
of
making
the
sounds
necessary
for
speech
he
rested
his
hands
on
their
shoulders
where
their
ebony
fur
was
frosted
with
gray
age
had
not
yet
affected
their
quick
flowing
movement
but
they
were
getting
old
they
were
only
a
few
weeks
short
of
his
own
age
he
could
not
remember
when
they
had
not
been
with
him
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
remember
those
hungry
days
when
he
and
fenrir
and
sigyn
shared
together
in
his
mother
lap
but
it
was
probably
only
his
imagination
from
having
heard
the
story
told
so
often
but
he
could
remember
for
certain
when
he
was
learning
to
walk
and
fenrir
and
sigyn
full
grown
then
walked
tall
and
black
beside
him
he
could
remember
playing
with
sigyn
pups
and
he
could
remember
sigyn
watching
over
them
all
sometimes
giving
her
pups
a
bath
and
his
face
a
washing
with
equal
disregard
for
their
and
his
protests
above
all
he
could
remember
the
times
when
he
was
almost
grown
the
wild
free
days
when
he
and
fenrir
and
sigyn
had
roamed
the
mountains
together
with
a
bow
and
a
knife
and
two
prowlers
beside
him
he
had
felt
that
there
was
nothing
on
ragnarok
that
they
could
not
conquer
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
universe
they
could
not
defy
together
there
was
a
flicker
of
black
movement
and
a
young
messenger
prowler
came
running
from
the
direction
of
the
council
hall
a
mocker
clinging
to
its
back
it
leaped
up
on
the
wall
beside
him
and
the
mocker
one
that
had
been
trained
to
remember
and
repeat
messages
verbatim
took
a
breath
so
deep
that
its
cheeks
bulged
out
it
spoke
in
a
quick
rush
like
a
child
that
is
afraid
it
might
forget
some
of
the
words
you
will
please
come
to
the
council
hall
to
lead
the
discussion
regarding
the
last
preparations
for
the
meeting
with
the
gerns
the
transmitter
is
completed
the
lathe
was
torn
down
the
next
day
and
the
smelter
began
to
roar
with
its
forced
draft
excitement
and
anticipation
ran
through
the
town
like
a
fever
it
would
take
perhaps
twenty
days
to
build
the
generator
working
day
and
night
so
that
not
an
hour
of
time
would
be
lost
forty
days
for
the
signal
to
reach
athena
and
forty
days
for
the
gern
cruiser
to
reach
ragnarok
in
one
hundred
days
the
gerns
would
be
there
the
men
who
would
engage
in
the
fight
for
the
cruiser
quit
trimming
their
beards
later
when
it
was
time
for
the
gerns
to
appear
they
would
discard
their
woolen
garments
for
ones
of
goat
skin
the
gerns
would
regard
them
as
primitive
inferiors
at
best
and
it
might
be
of
advantage
to
heighten
the
impression
it
would
make
the
awakening
of
the
gerns
a
little
more
shocking
an
underground
passage
leading
from
the
town
to
the
concealment
of
the
woods
in
the
distance
had
long
ago
been
dug
through
it
the
women
and
children
would
go
when
the
gerns
arrived
there
was
a
level
area
of
ground
just
beyond
the
south
wall
of
town
where
the
cruiser
would
be
almost
certain
to
land
the
town
had
been
built
with
that
thought
in
mind
woods
were
not
far
from
both
sides
of
the
landing
site
and
unicorn
corrals
were
hidden
in
them
from
the
corrals
would
come
the
rear
flanking
attack
against
the
gerns
the
prowlers
of
course
would
be
scattered
among
all
the
forces
the
generator
was
completed
and
installed
on
the
nineteenth
night
charley
craig
a
giant
of
a
man
whose
red
beard
gave
him
a
genially
murderous
appearance
opened
the
valve
of
the
water
pipe
the
new
wooden
turbine
stirred
and
belts
and
pulleys
began
to
spin
the
generator
hummed
the
needles
of
the
dials
climbed
flickered
and
steadied
norman
lake
looked
from
them
to
humbolt
his
pale
gray
eyes
coldly
satisfied
full
output
he
said
we
have
the
power
we
need
this
time
jim
chiara
was
at
the
transmitter
and
they
waited
while
he
threw
switches
and
studied
dials
every
component
of
the
transmitter
had
been
tested
but
they
had
not
had
the
power
to
test
the
complete
assembly
that
it
he
said
at
last
looking
up
at
them
she
ready
after
almost
two
hundred
years
of
wanting
her
humbolt
wondered
what
the
signal
should
be
and
saw
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
the
same
one
that
had
been
sent
out
with
such
hope
a
hundred
and
years
ago
all
right
jim
he
said
let
the
gerns
know
we
waiting
for
them
make
it
calling
again
the
transmitter
key
rattled
and
the
signal
that
the
gerns
could
not
fail
to
receive
went
out
at
a
velocity
of
five
a
day
calling
ragnarok
calling
ragnarok
calling
it
was
the
longest
summer
humbolt
had
ever
experienced
he
was
not
alone
in
his
impatience
among
all
of
them
the
restlessness
flamed
higher
as
the
slow
days
dragged
by
making
it
almost
impossible
to
go
about
their
routine
duties
the
gentle
mockers
sensed
the
anticipation
of
their
masters
for
the
coming
battle
and
they
became
nervous
and
apprehensive
the
prowlers
sensed
it
and
they
paced
about
the
town
in
the
dark
of
night
watching
listening
on
ceaseless
guard
against
the
mysterious
enemy
their
masters
waited
for
even
the
unicorns
seemed
to
sense
what
was
coming
and
they
rumbled
and
squealed
in
their
corrals
at
night
with
the
lust
for
blood
and
sometimes
attacking
the
log
walls
with
blows
that
shook
the
ground
the
interminable
days
went
their
slow
succession
and
summer
gave
way
to
fall
the
hundredth
day
dawned
cold
and
gray
with
the
approach
of
winter
the
day
of
the
gerns
but
no
cruiser
came
that
day
nor
the
next
he
stood
again
on
the
stockade
wall
in
the
evening
of
the
third
day
fenrir
and
sigyn
beside
him
he
listened
for
the
first
dim
distant
sound
of
the
gern
cruiser
and
heard
only
the
moaning
of
the
wind
around
him
winter
was
coming
always
on
ragnarok
winter
was
coming
or
the
brown
death
of
summer
ragnarok
was
a
harsh
and
barren
prison
and
no
amount
of
desire
could
ever
make
it
otherwise
only
the
coming
of
a
gern
cruiser
could
ever
offer
them
the
bloody
violent
opportunity
to
regain
their
freedom
but
what
if
the
cruiser
never
came
it
was
a
thought
too
dark
and
hopeless
to
be
held
they
were
not
asking
a
large
favor
of
fate
after
two
hundred
years
of
striving
for
it
only
the
chance
to
challenge
the
gern
empire
with
bows
and
knives
fenrir
stiffened
the
fur
lifting
on
his
shoulders
and
a
muted
growl
coming
from
him
then
humbolt
heard
the
first
whisper
of
sound
a
faint
faraway
roaring
that
was
not
the
wind
he
watched
and
listened
and
the
sound
came
swiftly
nearer
rising
in
pitch
and
swelling
in
volume
then
it
broke
through
the
clouds
tall
and
black
and
beautifully
deadly
it
rode
down
on
its
rockets
of
flame
filling
the
valley
with
its
thunder
and
his
heart
hammered
with
exultation
it
had
come
the
cruiser
had
come
he
turned
and
dropped
the
ten
feet
to
the
ground
inside
the
stockade
the
warning
signal
was
being
sounded
from
the
center
of
town
a
unicorn
horn
that
gave
out
the
call
they
had
used
in
the
practice
alarms
already
the
women
and
children
would
be
hurrying
along
the
tunnels
that
led
to
the
temporary
safety
of
the
woods
beyond
town
the
gerns
might
use
their
turret
blasters
to
destroy
the
town
and
all
in
it
before
the
night
was
over
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
what
might
happen
before
it
ended
but
whatever
it
was
it
would
be
the
action
they
had
all
been
wanting
he
ran
to
where
the
others
would
be
gathering
fenrir
and
sigyn
loping
beside
him
and
the
horn
ringing
wild
and
savage
and
triumphant
as
it
announced
the
end
of
two
centuries
of
waiting
the
cruiser
settled
to
earth
in
the
area
where
it
had
been
expected
to
land
towering
high
above
the
town
with
its
turret
blasters
looking
down
upon
the
houses
charley
craig
and
norman
lake
were
waiting
for
him
on
the
high
steps
of
his
own
house
in
the
center
of
town
where
the
elevation
gave
them
a
good
view
of
the
ship
yet
where
the
fringes
of
the
canopy
would
conceal
them
from
the
ship
scanners
they
were
heavily
armed
their
prowlers
beside
them
and
their
mockers
on
their
shoulders
elsewhere
under
the
connected
rows
of
concealing
canopies
armed
men
were
hurrying
to
their
prearranged
stations
most
of
them
were
accompanied
by
prowlers
bristling
and
snarling
as
they
looked
at
the
alien
ship
a
few
men
were
deliberately
making
themselves
visible
not
far
away
going
about
unimportant
tasks
with
only
occasional
and
carefully
disinterested
glances
toward
the
ship
they
were
the
bait
to
lure
the
first
detachment
into
the
center
of
town
well
norman
lake
asked
his
pale
eyes
restless
with
his
hunger
for
violence
there
our
ship
when
do
we
take
her
just
as
soon
as
we
get
them
outside
it
he
said
we
use
the
plan
we
first
had
wait
until
they
send
a
full
force
to
rescue
the
first
detachment
and
then
hit
them
with
everything
we
have
his
black
mocker
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway
and
watching
the
hurrying
men
and
prowlers
with
worried
interest
tip
the
grandson
of
the
mocker
that
had
died
with
howard
lake
north
of
the
plateau
he
reached
down
to
pick
him
up
and
set
him
on
his
shoulder
and
said
jim
the
longbows
are
ready
tip
treble
imitation
of
jim
chiara
voice
answered
we
black
out
their
searchlights
when
the
time
comes
andy
he
asked
the
last
of
us
for
this
section
are
coming
in
now
andy
taylor
answered
he
made
his
check
of
all
the
subleaders
then
looked
up
to
the
roof
to
ask
all
set
jimmy
jimmy
stevens
grinning
face
appeared
over
the
edge
ten
crossbows
are
cocked
and
waiting
up
here
bring
us
our
targets
they
waited
while
the
evening
deepened
into
then
the
airlock
of
the
cruiser
slid
open
and
thirteen
gerns
emerged
the
one
leading
them
wearing
the
resplendent
uniform
of
a
subcommander
there
they
come
he
said
to
lake
and
craig
it
looks
like
we
be
able
to
trap
them
in
here
and
force
the
commander
to
send
out
a
force
we
all
attack
at
the
sound
of
the
horn
and
if
you
can
hit
their
rear
flanks
hard
enough
with
the
unicorns
to
give
us
a
chance
to
split
them
from
this
end
some
of
us
should
make
it
to
the
ship
before
they
realize
up
in
the
control
room
that
they
should
close
the
airlocks
now
he
looked
at
the
gerns
who
were
coming
straight
toward
the
stockade
wall
ignoring
the
gate
to
their
right
you
better
be
on
your
way
we
meet
again
before
long
in
the
ship
fenrir
and
sigyn
looked
from
the
advancing
gerns
to
him
with
question
in
their
eyes
after
lake
and
craig
were
gone
fenrir
growling
restlessly
pretty
soon
he
said
to
them
right
now
it
would
be
better
if
they
did
see
you
wait
inside
both
of
you
they
went
reluctantly
inside
to
merge
with
the
darkness
of
the
interior
only
an
occasional
yellow
gleam
of
their
eyes
showed
that
they
were
crouched
to
spring
just
inside
the
doorway
he
called
to
the
nearest
unarmed
man
not
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
gerns
cliff
you
and
sam
anders
come
here
tell
the
rest
to
fade
out
of
sight
and
get
armed
cliff
schroeder
passed
the
command
along
and
he
and
sam
anders
approached
he
looked
back
at
the
gerns
and
saw
they
were
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
for
them
unscalable
wall
of
the
stockade
they
were
coming
without
hesitation
a
pale
blue
beam
lashed
down
from
one
of
the
cruiser
turrets
and
a
fifty
foot
section
of
the
wall
erupted
into
dust
with
a
sound
like
thunder
the
wind
swept
the
dust
aside
in
a
gigantic
cloud
and
the
gerns
came
through
the
gap
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
that
i
suppose
sam
anders
said
from
beside
him
was
lesson
number
one
for
degenerate
savages
like
us
gerns
like
gods
are
not
to
be
hindered
by
barriers
the
gerns
walked
with
a
peculiar
gait
that
puzzled
him
until
he
saw
what
it
was
they
were
trying
to
come
with
the
arrogant
military
stride
affected
by
the
gerns
and
in
the
gravity
they
were
succeeding
in
achieving
only
a
heavy
clumping
they
advanced
steadily
and
as
they
drew
closer
he
saw
that
in
the
right
hand
of
each
gern
soldier
was
a
blaster
while
in
the
left
hand
of
each
could
be
seen
the
metallic
glitter
of
chains
schroeder
smiled
thinly
it
looks
like
they
want
to
subject
about
a
dozen
of
us
to
some
painful
questioning
no
one
else
was
any
longer
in
sight
and
the
gerns
came
straight
toward
the
three
on
the
steps
they
stopped
forty
feet
away
at
a
word
of
command
from
the
officer
and
gerns
and
ragnarok
men
exchanged
silent
stares
the
faces
of
the
ragnarok
men
bearded
and
expressionless
the
faces
of
the
gerns
hairless
and
reflecting
a
contemptuous
curiosity
narth
the
communicator
on
the
gern
officer
belt
spoke
with
metallic
authority
what
do
they
look
like
did
we
come
two
hundred
to
view
some
animated
vegetables
no
commander
narth
answered
i
think
the
discard
of
the
rejects
two
hundred
years
ago
has
produced
for
us
an
unexpected
reward
there
are
three
natives
under
the
canopy
before
me
and
their
physical
perfection
and
complete
adaptation
to
this
hellish
gravity
is
astonishing
they
could
be
used
to
replace
expensive
machines
on
some
of
the
outer
world
mines
the
commander
said
providing
their
intelligence
too
abysmally
low
what
about
that
they
can
surely
be
taught
to
perform
simple
manual
labor
narth
answered
get
on
with
your
job
the
commander
said
try
to
pick
some
of
the
most
intelligent
looking
ones
for
questioning
i
ca
believe
these
cattle
sent
that
message
and
they
going
to
tell
us
who
did
and
pick
some
young
strong
ones
for
the
medical
staff
to
examine
ones
that
wo
curl
up
and
die
after
the
first
few
cuts
of
the
knife
we
chain
these
three
first
narth
said
he
lifted
his
hand
in
an
imperious
gesture
to
humbolt
and
the
other
two
and
ordered
in
accented
terran
come
here
no
one
moved
and
he
said
again
sharply
come
here
again
no
one
moved
and
the
minor
officer
beside
narth
said
apparently
they
ca
even
understand
terran
now
then
we
give
them
some
action
they
can
understand
narth
snapped
his
face
flushing
with
irritation
we
drag
them
out
by
their
heels
the
gerns
advanced
purposefully
three
of
them
holstering
their
blasters
to
make
their
chains
ready
when
they
had
passed
under
the
canopy
and
could
not
be
seen
from
the
ship
humbolt
spoke
all
right
jimmy
the
gerns
froze
in
midstride
suspicion
flashing
across
their
faces
look
up
on
the
roof
he
said
in
gern
they
looked
and
the
suspicion
became
gaping
dismay
you
can
be
our
prisoners
or
you
can
be
corpses
he
said
we
care
which
the
urgent
hiss
of
narth
command
broke
their
indecision
kill
them
six
of
them
tried
to
obey
bringing
up
their
blasters
in
movements
that
seemed
curiously
heavy
and
slow
as
though
the
gravity
of
ragnarok
had
turned
their
arms
to
wood
three
of
them
almost
lifted
their
blasters
high
enough
to
fire
at
the
steps
in
front
of
them
before
arrows
went
through
their
throats
the
other
three
did
not
get
that
far
narth
and
the
remaining
six
went
rigidly
motionless
and
he
said
to
them
drop
your
blasters
quick
their
blasters
thumped
to
the
ground
and
jimmy
stevens
and
his
bowmen
slid
off
the
roof
within
a
minute
the
gerns
were
bound
with
their
own
chains
but
for
the
officer
and
the
blasters
were
in
the
hands
of
the
ragnarok
men
jimmy
looked
down
the
row
of
gerns
and
shook
his
head
so
these
are
gerns
he
said
it
was
like
trapping
a
band
of
woods
goats
young
ones
schroeder
amended
and
almost
as
dangerous
narth
face
flushed
at
the
words
and
his
eyes
went
to
the
ship
the
sight
of
it
seemed
to
restore
his
courage
and
his
lips
drew
back
in
a
snarl
you
fools
you
stupid
megalomaniac
do
you
think
you
can
kill
gerns
and
live
to
boast
about
it
keep
quiet
humbolt
ordered
studying
him
with
curiosity
narth
like
all
the
gerns
was
different
from
what
they
had
expected
it
was
true
the
gerns
had
strode
into
their
town
with
an
attempt
at
arrogance
but
they
were
harmless
in
appearance
soft
of
face
and
belly
and
the
snarling
of
the
narth
was
like
the
bluster
of
a
cornered
i
promise
you
this
narth
was
saying
viciously
if
you
do
release
us
and
return
our
weapons
this
instant
i
personally
oversee
the
extermination
of
you
and
every
savage
in
this
village
with
the
most
painful
death
science
can
contrive
and
i
humbolt
reached
out
his
hand
and
flicked
narth
under
the
chin
teeth
cracked
loudly
together
and
his
face
twisted
with
the
pain
of
a
bitten
tongue
tie
him
up
jess
he
said
to
a
man
near
him
if
he
opens
his
mouth
again
shove
your
foot
in
it
he
spoke
to
schroeder
we
keep
three
of
the
blasters
and
send
two
to
each
of
the
other
front
groups
have
that
done
dusk
was
deepening
into
darkness
and
he
called
chiara
again
turn
on
their
searchlights
any
minute
and
make
the
town
as
light
as
day
he
said
if
you
can
keep
them
blacked
out
until
some
of
us
have
reached
the
ship
i
think
we
have
won
they
be
kept
blacked
out
chiara
said
with
some
arrows
left
over
for
the
gerns
he
called
lake
and
craig
to
be
told
they
were
ready
and
waiting
but
we
having
hell
keeping
the
unicorns
quiet
craig
said
they
want
to
get
to
killing
something
he
pressed
the
switch
of
the
communicator
but
it
was
dead
they
had
of
course
transferred
to
some
other
wave
length
so
he
could
not
hear
the
commands
it
was
something
he
had
already
anticipated
fenrir
and
sigyn
were
still
obediently
inside
the
doorway
almost
frantic
with
desire
to
rejoin
him
he
spoke
to
them
and
they
bounded
out
snarling
at
three
gerns
in
passing
and
causing
them
to
blanch
to
a
color
he
set
tip
on
sigyn
shoulders
and
said
sigyn
there
a
job
for
you
and
tip
to
do
a
dangerous
job
listen
both
of
you
the
yellow
eyes
of
sigyn
and
the
dark
eyes
of
the
little
mocker
looked
into
his
as
he
spoke
to
them
and
accompanied
his
words
with
the
strongest
clearest
mental
images
he
could
project
sigyn
take
tip
to
the
thing
leave
him
hidden
in
the
grass
to
one
side
of
the
big
hole
in
it
tip
you
wait
there
when
the
come
out
you
listen
and
tell
what
they
say
now
do
you
both
understand
sigyn
made
a
sound
that
meant
she
did
but
tip
clutched
at
his
wrist
with
little
paws
suddenly
gone
cold
and
wailed
scared
scared
you
have
to
go
tip
he
said
gently
disengaging
his
wrist
and
sigyn
will
hide
near
to
you
and
watch
over
you
he
spoke
to
sigyn
when
the
horn
calls
you
run
back
with
him
again
she
made
the
sound
signifying
understanding
and
he
touched
them
both
in
what
he
hoped
would
not
be
the
last
farewell
all
right
sigyn
go
now
she
vanished
into
the
gloom
of
coming
night
tip
hanging
tightly
to
her
fenrir
stood
with
the
fur
lifted
on
his
shoulders
and
a
half
snarl
on
his
face
as
he
watched
her
go
and
watched
the
place
where
the
would
appear
where
freckles
he
asked
jimmy
here
someone
said
and
came
forward
with
tip
mate
he
set
freckles
on
his
shoulder
and
the
first
searchlight
came
on
shining
down
from
high
up
on
the
cruiser
it
lighted
up
the
area
around
them
in
harsh
white
brilliance
its
reflection
revealing
the
black
shadow
that
was
sigyn
just
vanishing
behind
the
ship
two
more
searchlights
came
on
to
illuminate
the
town
then
the
gerns
came
they
poured
out
through
the
airlock
and
down
the
ramp
there
to
form
in
columns
that
marched
forward
as
still
more
gerns
hurried
down
the
ramp
behind
them
the
searchlights
gleamed
on
their
battle
helmets
and
on
the
blades
of
the
bayonets
affixed
to
their
long
range
blasters
hand
blasters
and
grenades
hung
from
their
belts
together
with
stubby
flame
guns
they
were
a
solid
mass
reaching
halfway
to
the
stockade
before
the
last
of
them
the
commanding
officers
appeared
one
of
them
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
ramp
to
watch
the
advance
of
the
punitive
force
and
give
the
frightened
but
faithful
tip
the
first
words
to
transmit
to
freckles
the
full
force
is
on
its
way
commander
a
reply
came
in
freckles
simulation
of
the
metallic
tones
of
a
communicator
the
key
numbers
of
the
confiscated
blasters
have
been
checked
and
the
disturbance
rays
of
the
master
integrator
set
you
probably
have
few
natives
left
alive
to
take
as
prisoners
after
those
thirteen
charges
explode
but
continue
with
a
mopping
up
job
that
the
survivors
will
never
forget
the
gerns
could
by
remote
control
set
the
total
charges
of
stolen
blasters
to
explode
upon
touching
the
firing
stud
it
was
something
new
since
the
days
of
the
old
ones
he
called
chiara
and
the
other
groups
quickly
to
tell
them
what
he
had
learned
we
get
more
blasters
ones
they
ca
know
the
numbers
of
when
we
attack
he
finished
he
took
the
blaster
from
his
belt
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
the
front
ranks
of
the
gerns
were
almost
to
the
wall
by
then
a
column
wider
than
the
gap
that
had
been
blasted
through
it
coming
with
silent
purposefulness
two
blaster
beams
lanced
down
from
the
turrets
to
smash
at
the
wall
dust
billowed
and
thunder
rumbled
as
they
swept
along
a
full
three
hundred
feet
of
the
wall
had
been
destroyed
when
they
stopped
and
the
dust
hid
the
ship
and
made
dim
glows
of
the
searchlights
it
had
no
doubt
been
intended
to
impress
them
with
the
might
of
the
gerns
but
in
doing
so
it
hid
the
ragnarok
forces
from
the
advancing
gerns
for
a
few
seconds
jim
black
out
their
lights
before
the
dust
clears
he
called
joe
the
horn
we
attack
now
the
first
longbow
arrow
struck
a
searchlight
and
its
glow
grew
dimmer
as
the
arrow
burden
a
thin
tube
of
thick
lance
tree
ink
splattered
against
it
another
followed
then
the
horn
rang
out
harsh
and
commanding
and
in
the
distance
a
unicorn
screamed
in
answer
the
savage
cry
of
a
prowler
came
like
a
sound
to
match
and
the
attack
was
on
he
ran
with
fenrir
beside
him
and
to
his
left
and
right
ran
the
others
with
their
prowlers
the
lead
groups
converged
as
they
went
through
the
wide
gap
in
the
wall
they
ran
on
into
the
dust
cloud
and
the
shadowy
forms
of
the
gerns
were
suddenly
before
them
a
blaster
beam
cut
into
them
and
a
gern
shouted
the
natives
other
beams
sprang
into
life
winking
like
pale
blue
eyes
through
the
dust
and
killing
all
they
touched
the
beams
dropped
as
the
first
volley
of
arrows
tore
through
the
massed
front
ranks
to
be
replaced
by
others
they
charged
on
into
the
blue
winking
of
the
blasters
and
the
red
lances
of
the
flame
guns
with
the
crossbows
rattling
and
strumming
in
answer
the
prowlers
lunged
and
fought
beside
them
and
ahead
of
them
black
that
struck
the
gerns
too
swiftly
for
blasters
to
find
before
throats
were
torn
out
the
sound
of
battle
turned
into
a
confusion
of
raging
snarls
frantic
shouts
and
dying
screams
a
prowler
shot
past
him
to
join
fenrir
sigyn
and
he
felt
tip
dart
up
to
his
shoulder
she
made
a
sound
of
greeting
in
passing
a
sound
that
was
gone
as
her
jaws
closed
on
a
gern
the
dust
cloud
cleared
a
little
and
the
searchlights
looked
down
on
the
scene
no
longer
brilliantly
white
but
shining
through
the
lance
tree
ink
as
a
blood
red
glow
a
searchlight
turret
slid
shut
and
opened
a
moment
later
the
light
wiped
clean
the
longbows
immediately
transformed
it
into
a
red
glow
the
beam
of
one
of
the
turret
blasters
stabbed
down
to
blaze
a
trail
of
death
through
the
battle
it
ceased
as
its
own
light
revealed
to
the
gern
commander
that
the
ragnarok
forces
were
so
intermixed
with
the
gern
forces
that
he
was
killing
more
gerns
than
ragnarok
men
by
then
the
fighting
was
so
hand
to
hand
that
knives
were
better
than
crossbows
the
gerns
fell
like
harvested
corn
too
slow
and
awkward
to
use
their
bayonets
against
the
faster
ragnarok
men
and
killing
as
many
of
one
another
as
men
when
they
tried
to
use
their
blasters
and
flame
guns
from
the
rear
there
came
the
command
of
a
gern
officer
shouted
high
and
thin
above
the
sound
of
battle
back
to
the
ship
leave
the
natives
for
the
ship
blasters
to
kill
the
unicorns
arrived
then
to
cut
off
their
retreat
they
came
twenty
from
the
east
and
twenty
from
the
west
in
a
thunder
of
hooves
squealing
and
screaming
in
their
blood
lust
with
prowlers
a
black
wave
going
before
them
they
struck
the
gerns
the
prowlers
slashing
lanes
through
them
while
the
unicorns
charged
behind
trampling
them
ripping
into
them
with
their
horns
and
smashing
them
down
with
their
hooves
as
they
vented
the
pent
up
rage
of
their
years
of
confinement
on
the
back
of
each
was
a
rider
whose
long
spear
flicked
and
stabbed
into
the
throats
and
bellies
of
gerns
the
retreat
was
halted
and
transformed
into
milling
confusion
he
led
his
own
groups
in
the
final
charge
the
prearranged
wedge
attack
and
they
split
the
gern
force
in
two
the
ship
was
suddenly
just
beyond
them
he
gave
the
last
command
to
lake
and
craig
into
the
ship
he
scooped
up
a
blaster
from
beside
a
fallen
gern
and
ran
toward
it
a
gern
officer
was
already
in
the
airlock
his
face
pale
and
strained
as
he
looked
back
and
his
hand
on
the
closing
switch
he
shot
him
and
ran
up
the
ramp
as
the
officer
body
rolled
down
it
unicorn
hooves
pounded
behind
him
and
twenty
of
them
swept
past
their
riders
leaping
from
their
backs
to
the
ramp
twenty
men
and
fifteen
prowlers
charged
up
the
ramp
as
a
warning
siren
shrieked
somewhere
inside
the
ship
at
the
same
time
the
airlocks
operated
from
the
control
room
began
to
slide
swiftly
shut
he
was
through
first
with
fenrir
and
sigyn
lake
and
craig
together
with
six
men
and
four
prowlers
squeezed
through
barely
in
time
then
the
airlocks
were
closed
and
they
were
sealed
in
the
ship
alarm
bells
added
their
sound
to
the
shrieking
of
the
siren
and
from
the
shafts
came
the
whir
of
elevators
dropping
with
gern
forces
to
kill
the
humans
trapped
inside
the
ship
they
ran
past
the
elevator
shafts
without
pausing
light
and
swift
in
the
artificial
gravity
that
was
only
that
of
ragnarok
they
split
forces
as
long
ago
planned
three
men
and
four
prowlers
going
with
charley
craig
in
the
attempt
to
take
the
drive
room
lake
and
the
other
three
men
going
with
him
in
the
attempt
to
take
the
control
room
they
found
the
manway
ladder
and
began
to
climb
fenrir
and
sigyn
impatiently
crowding
their
heels
there
was
nothing
on
the
control
room
level
and
they
ran
down
the
short
corridor
that
their
maps
had
showed
they
turned
left
into
the
corridor
that
had
the
control
room
at
its
end
and
into
the
concentrated
fire
of
nine
waiting
gerns
fenrir
and
sigyn
went
into
the
gerns
under
their
fire
before
they
could
drop
the
muzzles
of
their
blasters
with
an
attack
so
vicious
and
unexpected
that
what
would
have
been
a
certain
and
lethal
trap
for
the
humans
was
suddenly
a
fighting
chance
the
corridor
became
an
inferno
of
blaster
beams
that
cracked
and
hissed
as
they
met
and
crossed
throwing
little
chips
of
metal
from
the
walls
with
snapping
sounds
and
going
through
flesh
with
sounds
like
soft
tappings
it
was
over
within
seconds
the
last
gern
down
and
one
man
still
standing
beside
him
the
blond
and
nerveless
lake
thomsen
and
barber
were
dead
and
billy
west
was
bracing
himself
against
the
wall
with
a
blaster
hole
through
his
stomach
trying
to
say
something
and
sliding
to
the
floor
before
it
was
ever
spoken
and
sigyn
was
down
blood
welling
and
bubbling
from
a
wound
in
her
chest
while
fenrir
stood
over
her
with
his
snarling
a
raging
scream
as
he
swung
his
head
in
search
of
a
gern
humbolt
and
lake
ran
on
fenrir
raging
beside
them
and
into
the
control
room
six
officers
one
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
commander
were
gaping
in
astonishment
and
bringing
up
their
blasters
in
the
way
that
seemed
so
curiously
slow
to
humbolt
fenrir
in
his
fury
killed
two
of
them
as
lake
blaster
and
his
own
killed
three
more
the
commander
was
suddenly
alone
his
blaster
half
lifted
fenrir
leaped
at
his
throat
and
humbolt
shouted
the
quick
command
disarm
it
was
something
the
prowlers
had
been
taught
in
their
training
and
fenrir
teeth
clicked
short
of
the
commander
throat
while
his
paw
sent
the
blaster
spinning
across
the
room
the
commander
stared
at
them
with
his
swarthy
face
a
dark
gray
and
his
mouth
still
gaping
how
how
did
you
do
it
he
asked
in
heavily
accented
terran
only
two
of
you
do
talk
until
you
asked
a
question
lake
said
only
two
of
you
the
thought
seemed
to
restore
his
courage
as
sight
of
the
ship
had
restored
narth
that
night
and
his
tone
became
threatening
there
are
only
two
of
you
and
more
guards
will
be
here
to
kill
you
within
a
minute
surrender
to
me
and
i
let
you
go
free
lake
slapped
him
across
the
mouth
with
a
backhanded
blow
that
snapped
his
head
back
on
his
shoulders
and
split
his
lip
do
talk
he
ordered
again
and
never
lie
to
us
the
commander
spit
out
a
tooth
and
held
his
hand
to
his
bleeding
mouth
he
did
not
speak
again
tip
and
freckles
were
holding
tightly
to
his
shoulder
and
each
other
the
racing
of
their
hearts
like
a
vibration
and
he
touched
them
reassuringly
all
right
now
all
safe
now
he
said
he
called
charley
craig
charley
did
you
make
it
we
made
it
to
the
drive
room
two
of
us
and
one
prowler
charley
answered
what
about
you
norman
and
i
have
the
control
room
cut
their
drives
to
play
safe
i
let
you
know
as
soon
as
the
entire
ship
is
ours
he
went
to
the
viewscreen
and
saw
that
the
battle
was
over
chiara
was
letting
the
searchlight
burn
again
and
prowlers
were
being
used
to
drive
back
the
unicorns
from
the
surrendering
gerns
i
guess
we
won
he
said
to
lake
but
there
was
no
feeling
of
victory
none
of
the
elation
he
had
thought
he
would
have
sigyn
was
dying
alone
in
the
alien
corridor
outside
sigyn
who
had
nursed
beside
him
and
fought
beside
him
and
laid
down
her
life
for
him
i
want
to
look
at
her
he
said
to
lake
fenrir
went
with
him
she
was
still
alive
waiting
for
them
to
come
back
to
her
she
lifted
her
head
and
touched
his
hand
with
her
tongue
as
he
examined
the
wound
it
was
not
fatal
it
need
not
be
fatal
he
worked
swiftly
gently
to
stop
the
bleeding
that
had
been
draining
her
life
away
she
would
have
to
lie
quietly
for
weeks
but
she
would
recover
when
he
was
done
he
pressed
her
head
back
to
the
floor
and
said
lie
still
sigyn
girl
until
we
can
come
to
move
you
wait
for
us
and
fenrir
will
stay
here
with
you
she
obeyed
and
he
left
them
the
feeling
of
victory
and
elation
coming
to
him
in
full
then
lake
looked
at
him
questioningly
as
he
entered
the
control
room
and
he
said
she
live
he
turned
to
the
gern
commander
first
i
want
to
know
how
the
war
is
going
i
the
commander
looked
uncertainly
at
lake
just
tell
the
truth
lake
said
whether
you
think
we
like
it
or
not
we
have
all
the
planets
but
earth
itself
the
commander
said
have
it
soon
and
the
terrans
on
athena
they
still
working
for
us
there
now
he
said
you
will
order
every
gern
in
this
ship
to
go
to
his
sleeping
quarters
they
will
leave
their
weapons
in
the
corridors
outside
and
they
will
not
resist
the
men
who
will
come
to
take
charge
of
the
ship
the
commander
made
an
effort
toward
defiance
and
if
i
refuse
lake
answered
smiling
at
him
with
the
smile
of
his
that
was
no
more
than
a
quick
showing
of
teeth
and
with
the
savage
eagerness
in
his
eyes
if
you
refuse
i
start
with
your
fingers
and
break
every
bone
to
your
shoulders
if
that
is
enough
i
start
with
your
toes
and
go
to
your
hips
and
then
i
break
your
back
the
commander
hesitated
sweat
filming
his
face
as
he
looked
at
them
then
he
reached
out
to
switch
on
the
communicator
and
say
into
it
attention
all
personnel
you
will
return
to
your
quarters
at
once
leaving
your
weapons
in
the
corridors
you
are
ordered
to
make
no
resistance
when
the
natives
come
there
was
a
silence
when
he
had
finished
and
humbolt
and
lake
looked
at
each
other
bearded
and
clad
in
animal
skins
but
standing
at
last
in
the
control
room
of
a
ship
that
was
theirs
in
a
ship
that
could
take
them
to
athena
to
earth
to
the
ends
of
the
galaxy
the
commander
watched
them
on
his
face
the
blankness
of
unwillingness
to
believe
the
airlocks
he
said
we
did
close
them
in
time
we
never
thought
you
would
dare
try
to
take
the
ship
not
savages
in
animal
skins
i
know
humbolt
answered
we
were
counting
on
you
to
think
that
way
no
one
expected
any
of
you
to
survive
here
the
commander
wiped
at
his
swollen
lips
wincing
and
an
almost
petulance
came
into
his
tone
you
were
supposed
to
survive
i
know
he
said
again
we
made
it
a
point
to
remember
that
the
gravity
the
heat
and
cold
and
fever
the
animals
why
did
they
kill
you
they
tried
he
said
but
we
fought
back
and
we
had
a
goal
to
meet
you
gerns
again
you
left
us
on
a
world
that
had
no
resources
only
enemies
who
would
kill
us
the
gravity
the
prowlers
the
unicorns
so
we
made
them
our
resources
we
adapted
to
the
gravity
that
was
supposed
to
kill
us
and
became
stronger
and
quicker
than
gerns
we
made
allies
of
the
prowlers
and
unicorns
who
were
supposed
to
be
our
executioners
and
used
them
tonight
to
help
us
kill
gerns
so
now
we
have
your
ship
yes
you
have
our
ship
through
the
unwillingness
to
believe
on
the
commander
face
and
the
petulance
there
came
the
triumph
of
vindictive
anticipation
the
savages
of
ragnarok
have
a
gern
cruiser
but
what
can
they
do
with
it
what
can
we
do
with
it
he
asked
almost
kindly
we
planned
for
two
hundred
years
what
we
can
do
with
it
we
have
the
cruiser
and
sixty
days
from
now
we
have
athena
that
will
be
only
the
beginning
and
you
gerns
are
going
to
help
us
do
it
for
six
days
the
ship
was
a
scene
of
ceaseless
activity
men
crowded
it
asking
questions
of
the
gern
officers
and
crew
and
calmly
breaking
the
bones
of
those
who
refused
to
answer
or
who
gave
answers
that
were
not
true
prowlers
stalked
the
corridors
their
cold
yellow
eyes
watching
every
move
the
gerns
made
the
little
mockers
began
roaming
the
ship
at
will
unable
any
longer
to
restrain
their
curiosity
and
confident
that
the
men
and
prowlers
would
not
let
the
gerns
harm
them
one
mocker
was
killed
then
the
mocker
that
could
repeat
messages
verbatim
it
wandered
into
a
storage
cubicle
where
a
gern
was
working
alone
and
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
safely
vent
his
hatred
of
everything
associated
with
the
men
of
ragnarok
he
broke
its
back
with
a
steel
bar
and
threw
it
screaming
into
the
disposal
chute
that
led
to
the
matter
converter
a
prowler
heard
the
scream
and
an
instant
later
the
gern
screamed
a
sound
that
died
in
its
making
as
the
prowler
tore
his
throat
out
no
more
mockers
were
harmed
one
ragnarok
boy
was
killed
three
fanatical
gern
officers
stole
knives
from
the
galley
and
held
the
boy
as
hostage
for
their
freedom
when
their
demands
were
refused
they
cut
his
heart
out
lake
cornered
them
a
few
minutes
later
and
without
touching
his
blaster
disemboweled
them
with
their
own
knives
he
smiled
down
upon
them
as
they
writhed
and
moaned
on
the
floor
and
their
moans
were
heard
for
a
long
time
by
the
other
gerns
in
the
ship
before
they
died
no
more
humans
were
harmed
they
discovered
that
operation
of
the
cruiser
was
relatively
simple
basically
similar
to
the
operation
of
terran
ships
as
described
in
the
text
book
the
original
lake
had
written
most
of
the
operations
were
performed
by
robot
mechanisms
and
the
manual
operations
geared
to
the
slower
reflexes
of
the
gerns
were
easily
mastered
they
could
spend
the
voyage
to
athena
in
further
learning
and
practice
so
on
the
sixth
day
they
prepared
to
depart
the
unicorns
had
been
given
the
freedom
they
had
fought
so
well
for
and
reconnaissance
vehicles
were
loaned
from
the
cruiser
to
take
their
place
later
there
would
be
machinery
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
brought
in
by
freighter
ships
from
athena
time
was
precious
and
there
was
a
long
long
job
ahead
of
them
they
blasted
up
from
ragnarok
on
the
morning
of
the
seventh
day
and
went
into
the
black
sea
of
hyperspace
by
then
the
gern
commander
was
no
longer
of
any
value
to
them
his
unwillingness
to
believe
that
savages
had
wrested
his
ship
from
him
had
increased
until
his
compartment
became
his
control
room
to
him
and
he
spent
the
hours
laughing
and
giggling
before
an
imaginary
viewscreen
whereon
the
cruiser
blasters
were
destroying
over
and
over
the
ragnarok
town
and
all
the
humans
in
it
but
narth
who
had
wanted
to
have
them
tortured
to
death
for
daring
to
resist
capture
became
very
cooperative
in
the
control
room
his
cooperation
was
especially
eager
on
the
twentieth
day
of
the
voyage
they
let
him
have
what
he
had
been
trying
to
gain
by
subterfuge
access
to
the
transmitter
when
no
men
were
within
hearing
distance
after
that
his
manner
abruptly
changed
each
day
his
hatred
for
them
and
his
secret
anticipation
became
more
evident
the
day
came
with
athena
five
days
ahead
of
them
the
day
of
the
execution
they
had
let
him
arrange
for
them
stars
filled
the
transdimensional
viewscreen
the
sun
of
athena
in
the
center
humbolt
watched
the
space
to
the
lower
left
and
the
flicker
came
again
a
tiny
red
dot
that
was
gone
again
within
a
microsecond
so
quickly
that
narth
in
the
seat
beside
him
did
not
see
it
it
was
the
quick
peek
of
another
ship
a
ship
that
was
running
invisible
with
its
detector
screens
up
but
which
had
had
to
drop
them
for
an
instant
to
look
out
at
the
cruiser
not
even
the
gerns
had
ever
been
able
to
devise
a
polarized
detector
screen
he
changed
the
course
and
speed
of
the
cruiser
creating
an
increase
in
gravity
which
seemed
very
slight
to
him
but
which
caused
narth
to
slew
heavily
in
his
seat
narth
straightened
and
he
said
to
him
within
a
few
minutes
we
engage
the
ship
you
sent
for
narth
jaw
dropped
then
came
back
up
so
you
spied
on
me
one
of
our
ragnarok
allies
did
the
little
animal
that
was
sitting
near
the
transmitter
they
our
means
of
communication
we
learned
that
you
had
arranged
for
a
ship
en
route
to
athena
to
intercept
us
and
capture
us
so
you
know
narth
asked
he
smiled
an
unpleasant
twisting
of
his
mouth
do
you
think
that
knowing
will
help
you
any
we
expect
it
to
he
answered
it
a
battleship
narth
said
it
three
times
the
size
of
this
cruiser
the
newest
and
most
powerful
battleship
in
the
gern
fleet
how
does
that
sound
to
you
it
sounds
good
he
said
we
make
it
our
flagship
your
flagship
your
the
last
trace
of
pretense
left
narth
and
he
let
his
full
and
rankling
hatred
come
through
you
got
this
cruiser
by
trickery
and
learned
how
to
operate
it
after
a
fashion
because
of
an
reflex
abnormality
for
days
you
accidental
mutants
have
given
orders
to
your
superiors
and
thought
you
were
our
equals
now
your
fool
paradise
is
going
to
end
the
red
dot
came
again
closer
and
he
once
more
altered
the
course
he
had
turned
on
the
course
analyzer
and
it
clicked
as
the
battleship
position
was
correlated
with
that
of
its
previous
appearance
a
short
yellow
line
appeared
on
the
screen
to
forecast
its
course
for
the
immediate
future
and
then
he
asked
curiously
turning
back
to
narth
and
then
we
take
all
of
you
left
alive
back
to
your
village
the
scenes
of
what
we
do
to
you
and
your
village
will
be
televised
to
all
worlds
it
will
be
a
valuable
reminder
for
any
who
have
forgotten
the
penalty
for
resisting
gerns
the
red
dot
came
again
he
punched
the
battle
stations
button
and
the
board
responded
with
a
row
of
ready
lights
all
the
other
gerns
are
by
now
in
their
acceleration
couches
he
said
strap
yourself
in
for
high
acceleration
maneuvers
we
make
contact
with
the
battleship
within
two
minutes
narth
did
so
taking
his
time
as
though
it
was
something
of
little
importance
there
will
be
no
maneuvers
they
blast
the
stern
and
destroy
your
drive
immediately
upon
attack
he
fastened
the
last
strap
and
smiled
taunting
assurance
in
the
twisted
unpleasantness
of
it
the
appearance
of
this
battleship
has
very
much
disrupted
your
plans
to
strut
like
conquering
heroes
among
the
slaves
on
athena
has
it
not
exactly
humbolt
replied
our
plans
are
a
little
broader
in
scope
than
that
there
are
two
new
cruisers
on
athena
ready
to
leave
the
shops
ten
days
from
now
we
turn
control
of
athena
over
to
the
humans
there
of
course
then
we
take
the
three
cruisers
and
the
battleship
back
by
way
of
ragnarok
there
we
pick
up
all
the
ragnarok
men
who
are
neither
too
old
nor
too
young
and
go
on
to
earth
they
will
be
given
training
en
route
in
the
handling
of
ships
we
expect
to
find
no
difficulty
in
breaking
through
the
gern
lines
around
earth
and
then
with
the
addition
of
the
earth
ships
we
can
easily
capture
all
the
gern
ships
in
the
solar
system
narth
made
a
contemptuous
sneer
of
the
word
were
you
actually
so
stupid
as
to
think
that
you
biological
freaks
could
equal
gern
officers
who
have
made
a
career
of
space
warfare
we
far
exceed
them
he
said
a
space
battle
is
one
of
trying
to
keep
your
blaster
beams
long
enough
on
one
area
of
the
enemy
ship
to
break
through
its
blaster
shields
at
that
point
and
at
the
same
time
try
to
move
and
dodge
fast
enough
to
keep
the
enemy
from
doing
the
same
thing
to
you
the
ships
are
capable
of
accelerations
up
to
fifty
gravities
or
more
but
the
acceleration
limitator
is
the
safeguard
that
prevents
the
ship
from
going
into
such
a
high
degree
of
acceleration
or
into
such
a
sudden
change
of
direction
that
it
would
kill
the
crew
we
from
ragnarok
are
accustomed
to
a
one
point
five
gravity
and
can
withstand
much
higher
degrees
of
acceleration
than
gerns
or
any
other
race
from
a
one
gravity
world
to
enable
us
to
take
advantage
of
that
fact
we
have
had
the
acceleration
limitator
on
this
cruiser
disconnected
disconnected
narth
contemptuous
regard
vanished
in
frantic
consternation
you
fool
you
do
know
what
that
means
move
the
acceleration
lever
too
far
and
kill
us
all
the
red
dot
flicked
on
the
viewscreen
trembled
and
was
suddenly
a
gigantic
battleship
in
full
view
he
touched
the
acceleration
control
and
narth
next
words
were
cut
off
as
his
diaphragm
sagged
he
swung
the
cruiser
in
a
curve
and
narth
was
slammed
sideways
the
straps
cutting
into
him
and
the
flesh
of
his
face
pulled
lopsided
by
the
gravity
his
eyes
bulging
went
blank
with
unconsciousness
the
powerful
blasters
of
the
battleship
blossomed
like
a
row
of
pale
blue
flowers
concentrating
on
the
stern
of
the
cruiser
a
warning
siren
screeched
as
they
started
breaking
through
the
cruiser
shields
he
dropped
the
detector
screen
that
would
shield
the
cruiser
from
sight
but
not
from
the
blaster
beams
and
tightened
the
curve
until
the
gravity
dragged
heavily
at
his
own
body
the
warning
siren
stopped
as
the
blaster
beams
of
the
battleship
went
harmlessly
into
space
continuing
to
follow
the
probability
course
plotted
from
the
cruiser
last
visible
position
and
course
by
the
battleship
robot
target
tracers
he
lifted
the
detector
screen
to
find
the
battleship
almost
exactly
where
the
cruiser
course
analyzers
had
predicted
it
would
be
the
blasters
of
the
battleship
were
blazing
their
full
concentration
of
firepower
into
an
area
behind
and
to
one
side
of
the
cruiser
they
blinked
out
at
sight
of
the
cruiser
in
its
new
position
and
blazed
again
a
moment
later
boring
into
the
stern
he
dropped
the
detector
screen
and
swung
the
cruiser
in
another
curve
spiraling
in
the
opposite
direction
as
before
the
screech
of
the
alarm
siren
died
as
the
battleship
blasters
followed
the
course
given
them
by
course
analyzers
and
target
tracers
that
were
built
to
presume
that
all
enemy
ships
were
equipped
the
cruiser
could
have
destroyed
the
battleship
at
any
time
but
they
wanted
to
capture
their
flagship
unharmed
the
maneuvering
continued
the
cruiser
drawing
closer
to
the
battleship
the
battleship
in
desperation
began
using
the
same
tactics
the
cruiser
used
but
it
was
of
little
avail
the
battleship
moved
at
known
acceleration
limits
and
the
cruiser
course
analyzers
predicted
each
new
position
with
sufficient
accuracy
the
cruiser
made
its
final
dash
in
a
tightening
spiral
its
detector
screen
flickering
on
and
off
it
struck
the
battleship
at
a
matched
speed
with
a
thump
and
ringing
of
metal
as
the
magnetic
grapples
fastened
the
cruiser
like
a
leech
to
the
battleship
side
in
that
position
neither
the
forward
nor
stern
blasters
of
the
battleship
could
touch
it
there
remained
only
to
convince
the
commander
of
the
battleship
that
further
resistance
was
futile
this
he
did
with
a
simple
ultimatum
to
the
commander
this
cruiser
is
firmly
attached
to
your
ship
its
acceleration
limitator
disconnected
its
drives
are
of
sufficient
power
to
thrust
both
ships
forward
at
a
much
higher
degree
of
acceleration
than
persons
from
worlds
can
endure
you
will
surrender
at
once
or
we
shall
be
forced
to
put
these
two
ships
into
a
curve
of
such
short
radius
and
at
an
acceleration
so
great
that
all
of
you
will
be
killed
then
he
added
if
you
surrender
we
do
somewhat
better
by
you
than
you
did
with
the
humans
two
hundred
years
ago
we
take
all
of
you
on
to
athena
the
commander
already
sick
from
an
acceleration
that
would
have
been
negligible
to
ragnarok
men
had
no
choice
his
reply
came
choked
with
acceleration
sickness
and
the
greater
sickness
of
defeat
we
will
surrender
narth
regained
consciousness
he
saw
humbolt
sitting
beside
him
as
before
with
no
gern
rescuers
crowding
into
the
control
room
with
shouted
commands
and
drawn
blasters
where
are
they
he
asked
where
is
the
battleship
we
captured
it
he
said
you
captured
a
gern
battleship
it
was
hard
he
said
it
would
have
been
easier
if
only
ragnarok
men
had
been
on
the
cruiser
we
did
want
to
accelerate
to
any
higher
gravities
than
absolutely
necessary
because
of
the
gerns
on
it
you
did
it
you
captured
the
battleship
narth
said
his
tone
like
one
dazed
he
wet
his
lips
staring
as
he
contemplated
the
unpleasant
implications
of
it
you
freak
mutants
who
can
capture
a
battleship
maybe
you
will
take
athena
and
earth
from
us
but
the
animation
of
hatred
returned
to
his
face
what
good
will
it
do
you
did
you
ever
think
about
that
yes
he
said
we
thought
about
it
have
you
narth
leaned
forward
his
face
shining
with
the
malice
of
his
gloating
you
can
never
escape
the
consequences
of
what
you
have
done
the
gern
empire
has
the
resources
of
dozens
of
worlds
the
empire
will
build
a
fleet
of
special
ships
a
force
against
which
your
own
will
be
nothing
and
send
them
to
earth
and
athena
and
ragnarok
the
empire
will
smash
you
for
what
you
have
done
and
if
there
are
any
survivors
of
your
race
left
they
will
cringe
before
gerns
for
a
hundred
generations
to
come
remember
that
while
you
posturing
in
your
little
hour
of
glory
on
athena
and
earth
you
insist
in
thinking
we
do
as
gerns
would
do
he
said
we
delay
to
do
any
posturing
we
have
a
large
fleet
when
we
leave
earth
and
we
go
at
once
to
engage
the
gern
home
fleet
i
thought
you
knew
we
were
going
to
do
that
we
going
to
cripple
and
capture
your
fleet
and
then
we
going
to
destroy
your
empire
destroy
the
empire
narth
stared
again
all
the
gloating
gone
as
he
saw
at
last
the
quick
and
inexorable
end
now
before
we
can
stop
you
before
we
can
have
a
chance
when
a
race
has
been
condemned
to
die
by
another
race
and
it
fights
and
struggles
and
manages
somehow
to
survive
it
learns
a
lesson
it
learns
it
must
never
again
let
the
other
race
be
in
position
to
destroy
it
so
this
is
the
harvest
you
reap
from
the
seeds
you
sowed
on
ragnarok
two
hundred
years
ago
you
understand
do
you
he
asked
almost
gently
for
two
hundred
years
the
gern
empire
has
been
a
menace
to
our
survival
as
a
race
now
the
time
has
come
when
we
shall
remove
it
he
stood
in
the
control
room
of
the
battleship
and
watched
athena
sun
in
the
viewscreen
blazing
like
a
white
flame
sigyn
fully
recovered
was
stretched
out
on
the
floor
near
him
twitching
and
snarling
a
little
in
her
sleep
as
she
fought
again
the
battle
with
the
gerns
fenrir
was
pacing
the
floor
swinging
his
black
massive
head
restlessly
while
tip
and
freckles
were
examining
with
fascinated
curiosity
the
collection
of
bright
medals
that
had
been
cleaned
out
of
the
gern
commander
desk
lake
and
craig
left
their
stations
as
impatient
as
fenrir
and
came
over
to
watch
the
viewscreen
with
him
one
day
more
craig
said
we
two
hundred
years
late
but
coming
in
to
the
world
that
was
to
have
been
our
home
it
can
never
be
now
he
said
have
any
of
us
ever
thought
of
that
that
we
different
to
humans
and
there
no
human
world
we
could
ever
call
home
i
thought
of
it
lake
said
ragnarok
made
us
different
physically
and
different
in
the
way
we
think
we
could
live
on
human
worlds
but
we
would
always
be
a
race
apart
and
never
really
belong
there
i
suppose
we
all
thought
about
it
craig
said
and
wondered
what
we
do
when
we
finished
with
the
gerns
not
settle
down
on
athena
or
earth
in
a
little
cottage
with
a
lawn
where
it
would
be
adventure
to
watch
the
shows
after
each
day
at
some
safe
routine
job
not
back
to
ragnarok
lake
said
with
metals
and
supplies
from
other
worlds
they
be
able
to
do
a
lot
there
but
the
battle
is
already
won
there
will
be
left
only
the
peaceful
development
building
a
town
at
the
equator
for
big
winter
leveling
land
planting
crops
we
could
never
be
satisfied
with
that
kind
of
a
life
no
he
said
and
felt
his
own
restlessness
stir
in
protest
at
the
thought
of
settling
down
in
some
safe
and
secure
environment
not
athena
or
earth
or
ragnarok
not
any
world
we
know
how
long
until
we
finished
with
the
gerns
lake
asked
ten
years
we
still
be
young
then
where
will
we
go
all
of
us
who
fought
the
gerns
and
all
of
the
ones
in
the
future
who
wo
want
to
live
out
their
lives
on
ragnarok
where
is
there
a
place
for
us
a
world
of
our
own
where
do
we
find
a
world
of
our
own
he
asked
and
watched
the
star
clouds
creep
toward
them
in
the
viewscreen
tumbled
and
blazing
and
immense
beyond
conception
there
a
galaxy
for
us
to
explore
he
said
there
are
millions
of
suns
and
thousands
of
worlds
waiting
for
us
maybe
there
are
races
out
there
like
the
gerns
and
maybe
there
are
races
such
as
we
were
a
hundred
years
ago
who
need
our
help
and
maybe
there
are
worlds
out
there
with
things
on
them
such
as
no
man
ever
imagined
we
go
to
see
what
there
our
women
will
go
with
us
and
there
will
be
some
worlds
on
which
some
of
us
will
want
to
stay
and
always
there
will
be
more
restless
ones
coming
from
ragnarok
out
there
are
the
worlds
and
the
homes
for
all
of
us
of
course
lake
said
beyond
the
space
frontier
where
else
would
we
ever
belong
it
was
all
settled
then
and
there
was
a
silence
as
the
battleship
plunged
through
hyperspace
the
cruiser
running
beside
her
and
their
drives
moaning
and
thundering
as
had
the
drives
of
the
two
hundred
years
before
a
voyage
had
been
interrupted
then
and
a
new
race
had
been
born
now
they
were
going
on
again
to
athena
to
earth
to
the
farthest
reaches
of
the
gern
empire
and
on
to
the
wild
unknown
regions
of
space
beyond
there
awaited
their
worlds
and
